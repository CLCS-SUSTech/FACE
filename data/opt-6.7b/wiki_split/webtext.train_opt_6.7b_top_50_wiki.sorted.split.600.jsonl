{"id":4832,"ended":true,"length":586,"text":"Johnson further established himself as a quality player in Phoenix. In his three years as a Sun, Johnson averaged 14 \u2013 20 points a game and provided tough defense. He played in three All \u2013 Star Games, was selected as an All \u2013 NBA Third Team player in 2004, and became an All \u2013 NBA Second Team player two years later. Johnson had his best years in Phoenix as a member of the 2004 \u2013 05 Suns team.\n\nJohnson had his breakout season with the Suns in 2004 \u2013 05. During that season, Johnson, in his second year in the NBA, averaged a league \u2013 high and franchise \u2013 high 24. 3 points, 7. 5 rebounds and 5. 5 assists per game. To this day, Johnson remains the only player in franchise history and only the third player in league history to average at least 24 points, seven rebounds and six assists per game in a season. The Sun also led the NBA in assist \u2013 to -turnover ratio that season, an indication that the team had moved Johnson in areas where he knew that there would be a more positive impact. The following season, Johnson was given a five \u2013 year contract extension worth approximately $85. 8 million.\n\nIn 2006 \u2013 07, Johnson experienced a knee injury, but still managed to average 15. 2 points and 6. 7 rebounds a game while providing good defense. However, the next year, injuries would again keep him from playing at a high level. He finished with 16. 5 points and 6. 4 rebounds per game while seeing his shooting percentage fall to just. 39 percent.\n\nDespite Johnson coming off the bench for the second year in a row, he was able to average 18. 5 points and seven rebounds a game. He was also the second leading scorer on the team in 2007 \u2013 08.\n\nHe had some of his best numbers in 2009 \u2013 10 when he averaged career highs of 18. 4 points, 6. 7 rebounds and 5. 3 assists per game, but the injuries would return. He played his last game in March 2010, ending a nine - year career in which he averaged more than 18 points a game once and more than 20 points 10 times. His 9, 924 points were the second highest in the 19 year history of the Phoenix Suns and the most since Charles Barkley scored 9, 532 from 1981 \u2013 86.\n\nIn his NBA career, Johnson was a First Team All - NBA selection at the end of three different seasons. He was also an All \u2013 NBA First or Second Team selection after both the 1999 and 2002 seasons. Johnson was named First Team All \u2013 Defense in 2005 and 2006. In 2003, Sports Illustrated chose him as its male athlete of the year. He was the 2005 NBA Most Improved Player and the 2005 NBA Third Team All \u2013 NBA selection. In 2006 he was named to the All - Time NBA First and the All - Time NBA Third teams as well as the All - Time NBA First and Third teams for the 1990s.","token_len":601,"entropy":[9.1195,7.2054,3.6025,0.225,0.8219,6.5265,2.6307,1.8201,7.0923,2.071,3.4713,1.8891,3.8814,1.6055,2.6071,0.7127,7.8108,2.923,5.9342,2.143,3.4984,10.9727,3.7819,0.5161,2.0885,0.1732,1.7306,5.718,8.4179,2.4486,1.9864,1.442,3.7004,2.4553,3.8991,3.8695,12.3749,5.7193,2.1758,1.493,4.0369,3.3707,2.4056,2.9165,0.3735,1.0128,6.0798,6.2079,0.1369,4.3459,2.1988,3.8526,1.38,0.7204,4.5241,1.9322,0.1098,0.2623,0.507,2.1007,0.0293,1.3781,6.3028,0.3739,0.1229,0.2446,1.9115,3.6951,3.2342,0.9375,3.7734,1.2898,0.5167,2.8397,0.4418,2.9658,0.006,0.1824,6.6776,6.2253,6.4779,1.0184,2.3802,0.9649,1.4049,0.0009,1.7693,3.3795,2.4253,4.1015,0.5431,1.7571,0.4428,0.3811,0.9082,1.4183,2.6822,2.3613,1.8375,3.5951,1.6558,1.3335,0.2326,1.0649,5.7899,3.9486,1.4077,2.0942,1.6793,2.1846,1.1708,1.0695,0.1418,1.0141,4.1153,3.0969,7.0187,6.4259,6.9052,6.2468,2.2038,3.584,5.1974,2.0484,10.7674,2.8731,1.0069,2.5564,1.2043,9.1639,0.3613,0.7822,2.0285,0.7401,2.6245,0.1253,1.5846,0.0425,1.1623,7.1644,3.3617,0.8847,0.1426,0.7417,2.8814,1.8604,2.3352,0.4541,0.6959,5.0972,0.0113,6.1809,4.0364,1.507,1.7122,0.6519,0.8175,3.6543,0.0074,0.2837,1.9634,1.0073,0.007,3.6249,0.3232,2.1585,4.3437,0.0925,0.3002,4.4362,0.0159,0.8397,0.0139,1.7423,0.7815,0.4216,0.3232,3.1813,5.8632,2.8594,5.6328,0.1421,1.0706,0.1596,5.0476,6.9292,6.3039,5.1381,11.4549,0.0942,0.103,5.4908,1.9359,1.8597,5.0697,5.0351,0.707,2.5204,2.0074,2.6023,6.4453,6.3166,3.1173,7.8743,1.2513,0.5408,7.5842,3.6859,4.6114,1.9493,0.1731,2.1821,5.094,3.1874,0.693,0.9464,2.8748,4.7072,0.7749,0.2529,0.8157,2.4546,5.4214,1.0255,4.3278,3.3636,1.0309,0.6409,0.8148,3.243,3.9509,0.0502,5.4175,2.6406,9.447,1.4187,1.0823,1.025,0.0002,2.0717,2.3955,2.3691,0.7722,0.2218,0.3741,6.7042,1.1015,5.9674,0.1545,3.143,2.1982,5.2835,1.8941,0.0556,5.1399,3.2602,1.2434,4.8951,0.3362,1.2675,1.8849,0.3092,3.3769,0.3247,1.9879,0.0254,4.0533,5.0792,3.6385,0.6267,0.9936,4.1281,0.0334,2.1732,4.7183,0.9708,0.4846,4.413,5.6586,4.7212,4.2774,0.8694,1.5231,1.3798,3.3501,0.9311,0.2876,0.0362,0.8544,2.223,4.0759,1.881,4.4372,1.4048,2.9166,0.476,0.8595,1.5934,0.1821,2.1727,0.2316,1.6752,0.0226,2.4875,8.4269,1.3698,3.3999,2.4745,2.4241,1.2893,3.9294,7.9083,6.8657,2.2399,1.1165,1.4307,0.0002,5.0849,4.5322,7.0345,0.9058,1.5387,0.1561,2.1723,0.8237,3.7966,2.7347,0.1804,0.0194,0.0004,0.2762,1.4863,1.6878,3.5761,0.0055,6.7533,3.2015,0.4148,3.0929,0.1382,0.6638,7.3213,0.1925,1.1604,0.0131,1.5738,1.6745,1.7124,1.3147,2.7277,2.8785,4.9166,0.0743,2.5653,0.2087,1.6247,1.7684,4.5223,1.5605,2.4549,0.9354,2.1899,0.0002,4.0731,2.6374,3.8569,3.3648,0.9746,0.414,6.1884,0.9229,4.284,0.6173,1.0702,7.3556,0.7352,1.3153,8.7393,0.5673,0.4357,2.6988,0.2942,2.1764,0.3907,1.0308,1.677,0.1637,2.5628,0.0539,0.296,1.5276,0.1094,2.1387,0.0613,0.6164,0.0085,2.8029,2.4767,3.1742,4.9024,2.579,5.9554,2.6381,1.5259,3.2116,3.628,2.0526,0.6881,1.5504,5.7222,1.6671,1.7423,6.1028,1.9457,4.1154,5.746,1.4646,1.9311,2.0746,2.254,0.1923,0.6256,5.7174,0.1763,2.4945,0.1945,1.785,0.0259,8.1303,3.5306,5.2857,0.4112,1.7688,0.7003,7.5863,0.4137,0.4986,3.7698,6.5958,4.8328,5.1526,8.9064,1.8955,2.431,1.3954,1.7342,1.2293,1.7811,1.0096,10.224,2.8007,0.6794,0.0683,0.3959,3.258,0.2751,2.7867,1.2353,3.4954,2.6235,6.1511,0.5892,3.0613,2.503,0.4337,5.4169,4.2879,4.6656,4.2313,2.24,5.7207,1.1586,0.587,0.0002,1.9718,2.0151,5.7063,0.3035,0.2417,0.1569,2.1655,1.8803,6.5841,0.1285,0.0209,5.5373,2.8408,6.1746,4.7238,0.9633,2.4351,0.0024,8.9215,5.9929,0.2098,1.0035,0.9824,1.5363,1.9117,2.5835,0.0742,0.667,0.5362,2.0672,10.3,0.738,0.0318,1.6245,4.1362,6.9463,3.5172,4.2578,0.9597,1.5618,0.5716,0.3142,2.2901,1.4481,3.1522,3.3882,0.0872,0.0984,0.3884,9.6392,2.4048,2.885,1.4697,2.3545,1.1388,2.0445,3.8792,1.0913,10.1727,0.092,5.3663,0.9816,0.5883,3.6435,9.3341,3.4211,0.0538,0.0401,0.195,0.6431,2.0896,0.9415,2.9809,7.3655,2.2018,3.6225,1.9837,0.0734,1.5851,1.4468,1.9888,0.9343,5.6164,0.0638,0.8878,0.3838,4.171,5.5535,0.9189,1.8262,1.7889,3.1274,0.7383,0.9544,2.7063,0.2097,0.8828,4.0487,6.9723,4.3985,2.4057,7.1804,1.5144,2.7795,1.0503,0.2303,1.4086,3.1068,9.5113,4.5262,1.0841,0.8552,0.6546,1.635,0.4548,0.1289,0.7231,1.8738,2.74,3.6582,1.7772,3.9066,0.8706,7.7245,2.299,0.3512]}

The work to recover those rivers is being undertaken in Thailand in partnership with Thailand government as a key component of the country's development strategy and to provide economic stimulus to Thailand as it recovers from the global economic crisis.\n\nThe Living Rivers Initiative has brought together WWF, Bangkok Water Corporation (BWC), Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), local communities, and a number of NGOs, as well as international partners - the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) - to work towards saving and restoring rivers in northern and central Thailand. The main goals of the initiative are to:\n\nSave and expand the Mekong River system in its upper reaches and restore its vital fisheries;\n\nSave and restore forests and mangrove ecosystems of the Upper River Mekong and the northern coastal mangrove forests that act as buffers to storms and support fisheries by restoring the land mass that these forests used to cover;\n\nRehabilitate and sustainably manage the mangrove forests of the Lower River Mekong;\n\nRestore the land that the forested rivers used to cover and build flood protection for existing communities and support the development of new fishing areas and shrimp farms;\n\nStrengthen local communities\u2019 capacities to develop sustainable livelihoods and manage riverine ecosystems in line with best management practices;\n\nConserve, protect, develop and use freshwater ecosystems for sustainable livelihoods and enhance food security;\n\nEnhance local communities\u2019 capacities to support the sustainable management of freshwater ecosystems and to protect and enhance water supply and sanitation systems.\n\nThe Living Rivers Siam Initiative has reached the goal of saving the Upper River Mekong and the northern coastal mangrove forests since 2007 and is now focussed on restoring the area\u2019s forests, developing and supporting communities in using the riverine resources, strengthening their livelihoods and building stronger water supply and sanitation systems.

{"id":4740,"ended":true,"length":538,"text":"For the second consecutive race, the fastest driver in qualifying did not start the race from pole. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time, but a five @ - @ place grid penalty for a wheel nut change meant he started from ninth spot. Fernando Alonso was just ahead of him, but started third as his Renault power unit was changed following his first-lap incident with Schumacher. Mark Webber qualified fourth, with Lewis Hamilton fifth. Rubens Barrichello failed to make the final session, thus qualifying 21st, and ahead of his team mate Mika Hakkinen, who started 18th.\n\nIt was another one for the books at Adelaide as Michael Schumacher broke the all-time lap record set by Jim Clark earlier in 1965. McLaren were hoping for a front row lockout as they expected to start front of the grid - Hamilton was leading Alonso, Webber, Barrichello and Raikkonen. But they didn't get that either - Hamilton started P8, and Alonso P11. At the back of the grid were Barrichello and Hakkinen.\n\nThe Australian Grand Prix started with a bang as Michael Schumacher had first place on the grid. Then came the rain... and the drivers' nerves took centre-stage. Michael Schumacher got away cleanly, while behind him Fernando Alonso was in danger of getting his car stuck in a gravel trap. Schumacher quickly passed the McLaren of Jenson Button to take the lead and Alonso held off Schumacher's team mate Mark Webber to take second spot.\n\nFernando Alonso crashed out of the Australian Grand Prix at the first corner, leaving a field of eight Toyota's to battle it out in the hope of taking the first race victory of the new season. Michael Schumacher crashed out on the sixth lap leaving Mark Webber, Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel taking positions 2-4 as the race headed back to the pits.\n\nThere was another major mistake by Fernando Alonso on the first lap at Melbourne. On a damp track, the McLaren driver did not slow down when his team told him to, and ended up in the gravel in the first corner which led to his collision with Sergio Perez at the entrance. A safety car was placed out to allow new tyres to be added to his car, meaning that his suspension damage was not repaired prior to when the race got back to the race after the safety car. He finished a disappointing ninth.\n\nThere's a new team at the top of F1 this season and there's a new team at the bottom. It's true that Red Bull are the reigning champions, but it may not be Red Bull's drivers which the new team will be relying on to win the title this year. Toro Rosso are making a name for themselves by providing a path to F1 for young and hungry drivers, and their latest driver - Sebastian Vettel - comes from the same programme as 2007 world champion Lewis Hamilton.","token_len":603,"entropy":[2.5562,2.859,4.8066,7.5247,0.6296,1.8899,7.0169,2.9553,1.1497,4.7681,6.3899,0.7037,4.2076,1.904,0.5306,4.8304,1.9461,1.7001,6.4576,0.3683,0.0217,0.0004,6.021,1.3193,0.9109,0.7232,2.5797,1.8424,4.3758,6.7016,13.4664,7.4579,6.8817,8.1268,6.3178,1.3967,3.3163,2.3007,7.3733,7.928,6.6134,3.8567,1.2777,4.499,3.2436,6.2904,4.7231,0.7083,5.984,0.0118,2.5444,5.2241,1.6948,0.7341,1.7541,1.1572,1.1181,5.4212,4.9646,4.5735,3.0278,6.1401,5.7657,0.2345,2.1179,6.2257,7.2321,3.4575,3.3983,4.0389,0.8572,4.6246,1.2512,4.224,0.0046,0.0009,0.3519,6.9484,0.0321,0.0003,6.087,2.1256,1.247,3.5292,4.0956,0.0016,3.1003,0.6795,7.3975,0.009,0.0017,0.0013,0.0,5.3452,0.1862,2.6518,1.0755,2.3241,7.2466,1.4464,7.9031,1.8588,6.6413,0.6329,1.7,2.1815,7.4804,0.1176,3.2754,2.5887,0.6125,7.1541,0.055,0.082,0.0002,0.0006,2.0974,1.5567,3.122,4.7913,0.0111,0.7058,0.782,0.0052,4.4809,0.7689,4.7917,4.367,3.7568,1.2339,8.6753,3.2191,6.6112,4.1503,4.0535,0.0696,0.0013,0.0021,5.3262,1.4205,3.6353,0.2347,0.0319,3.0944,0.2725,3.1522,0.4704,6.6935,1.7197,5.7461,1.1039,10.1685,0.925,6.4027,3.407,5.6459,1.587,0.618,8.2272,1.0946,15.1401,2.8004,1.8789,5.9774,1.9202,3.6824,6.5165,5.4267,0.3458,0.5499,6.3021,6.3723,2.1136,4.9053,6.6193,2.0225,6.3683,0.0026,4.2227,6.0917,0.0306,0.0048,0.5006,6.8562,0.0018,0.0002,1.4008,2.572,2.8727,3.6861,0.0013,2.0023,2.7222,7.8271,2.9001,2.389,3.4036,8.9142,5.7157,1.7826,2.6724,4.2937,6.4909,3.5004,0.7707,5.193,1.1176,4.7816,0.8096,0.1012,0.3663,3.7904,6.1982,0.0299,0.0079,0.9328,3.2505,0.0008,0.0005,1.3654,1.3852,0.0003,2.0536,4.943,4.0476,0.0003,4.0556,2.3736,1.0249,6.2434,1.6753,3.9285,0.0595,0.0023,0.0018,4.0243,5.6067,4.3957,2.8346,0.8396,0.7523,1.2576,4.4505,3.2184,1.401,4.537,5.1275,2.0412,1.9375,5.2258,3.9667,6.192,4.39,5.2836,6.2876,0.0235,0.5081,4.4199,0.148,0.0022,0.0023,4.4425,5.0405,6.2957,0.4328,1.3938,4.4372,8.3209,0.6936,5.6451,0.0049,1.9934,3.1278,4.9029,0.2301,3.0134,3.1639,3.1822,3.3911,0.9572,1.9053,6.4209,4.7798,0.616,2.5798,0.0042,0.0041,5.0699,5.6818,1.908,7.3049,5.3154,5.2569,0.2853,0.0003,3.3054,3.0545,1.1934,0.5824,2.5155,3.5668,4.926,2.9734,1.318,0.0165,0.0097,2.0926,4.211,0.2128,4.653,0.03,0.0027,1.5624,1.9904,2.6043,5.177,0.3247,1.1581,0.0002,4.7939,0.1862,0.0022,0.0917,6.3405,1.474,0.8432,0.5688,4.3165,0.1791,0.0001,2.5411,1.0904,3.9064,1.6633,1.8674,3.1227,3.0364,5.55,0.4756,3.6249,7.5467,3.1848,3.1475,4.3384,1.2519,0.0027,1.9635,0.5286,9.6039,0.2704,3.2432,1.0517,3.5556,3.0811,3.6563,0.7842,0.7387,4.8915,1.7596,0.2,4.542,0.0181,0.0014,0.0018,4.5302,0.2221,4.9446,0.7255,5.9185,0.4528,7.3742,4.6441,0.0244,0.002,2.7179,4.296,0.0051,0.4607,3.3006,0.0099,0.0,6.8843,6.2654,6.6687,1.4543,2.6522,4.2178,1.2466,3.2973,5.6464,2.4505,0.4992,1.0568,1.3519,0.2543,0.9057,0.0003,4.9902,0.762,3.3853,5.2244,6.1677,2.3984,6.5328,0.0197,3.2809,0.592,2.3648,0.1754,4.8967,3.5159,1.3499,4.0666,3.3093,6.3745,2.3171,1.1235,1.9555,3.8704,3.331,4.4539,0.2219,6.0467,0.3771,3.6161,3.3193,1.9492,9.4646,0.1653,0.4501,2.7425,1.6795,6.5096,0.0968,2.6776,1.2084,5.6747,4.0286,1.4231,2.7075,2.4124,5.8613,2.5633,0.1088,3.2282,6.0295,0.1235,7.1269,0.023,3.59,0.4601,7.9225,1.8238,4.3293,4.854,1.2346,1.6465,3.7177,4.5274,2.4561,3.845,7.8946,2.4395,0.162,0.7747,3.6162,0.7387,3.3629,0.7353,1.3056,5.3986,1.5911,3.3658,7.3383,7.6587,1.3068,2.3291,2.2286,6.3948,0.0086,8.0937,1.2271,1.8322,5.659,2.4294,0.4041,0.3481,5.3012,7.4842,1.6258,3.7317,0.2071,3.1174,4.3874,4.6394,5.0358,3.6379,3.7575,1.6289,0.2738,0.0003,4.5036,4.81,1.5251,3.5456,4.4182,2.9865,1.5061,2.7183,0.1937,4.6537,0.0214,2.8597,0.928,2.5474,3.3374,0.773,1.1212,0.7407,2.0669,1.3611,0.3033,1.4903,1.5002,2.6026,0.4492,7.0184,0.2455,6.1821,0.0051,2.8365,2.8672,4.5364,1.1705,1.3398,0.2521,2.5517,5.683,1.4863,0.4402,4.9211,0.0114,1.2672,6.264,5.5985,6.1394,2.5486,0.969,1.462,1.101,5.3307,0.1234,1.538,1.9069,0.9394,2.3605,2.6512,0.7004,0.2178,8.3506,0.0004,0.0002,1.973,5.3191,1.3532,2.9941,0.0205,0.0389,1.8746,6.2239,1.6923,8.861,0.6038,4.1972,0.0163,3.6353,3.6611,4.0227,4.2115,0.2918,1.3238,1.4348,4.0915,5.0859,3.8174,4.7448,2.0777,0.0068,0.0001,0.2833,6.4722,1.2857,2.0198,1.6622,6.9898,0.8406,9.5196,3.1912,0.0779,2.8775,0.0004,0.5113]}
{"id":3789,"ended":true,"length":561,"text":"Though it was George Bulyea, Alberta's first lieutenant governor, who had invited Rutherford to form the province's first government in 1905, the Premier never fully enjoyed Bulyea's confidence. Rutherford's early experience with the political process was disappointing. First elected to the legislature in 1905, he won his seat in Calgary East by two votes only. His opponent had been the Liberal candidate who lost the election earlier that year to the Conservative.\n\nBy 1910 Rutherford was running as a Reform Party candidate and he ran much closer in that competition, winning the riding of Calgary East by 300 votes. He kept on the rise throughout his tenure, ultimately being appointed finance minister in 1914. During his time as finance minister he led the Province of Alberta to independence by passing the Alberta Act and the Act for the Organization of the Province of Alberta.\n\nThough Premier Rutherford has achieved a certain public recognition in recent years, perhaps the best way to truly understand Albertans'fondness for him is to go back to the Alberta that was in the years before both World Wars. The Province faced serious economic difficulties beginning in 1912 and there was no one willing or capable of solving these problems. With a growing agricultural economy, the Province did not have the capital to expand and it was the inability to expand without the support of the British government that caused them the most difficulties.\n\nRutherford took up the cause of an independent Alberta and began to agitate for Alberta provincehood at all costs. He was very active on this issue and he managed to convince the government of Prime Minister King George V that only Alberta could solve Alberta's economic problems. The Province of Alberta eventually became free from the Westminster government and became an independent country in 1911.\n\nRutherford was one of the first Albertans to hold a major political post in this new country. He also began to play a role in the development of Alberta as the oil industry grew throughout his time as Premier. He also played a major role in the development of education in the Province of Alberta through the Alberta Ministry of Education.\n\nWhen Rutherford resigned as Premier in 1920 due to his health, he handed the reins of government to Frederick W.C. Mackenzie. In 1924 Mackenzie resigned as Premier to become the Speaker of the Alberta Legislature.\n\nRutherford lived to the age of 87 in Calgary and he died in 1944 at the age of 91.\n\nGeorge Bulyea, Alberta's first Lieutenant Governor, established a tradition of appointing a Premier to succeed himself when he resigned from the office of premier. This may have been a result of his own experience with the political process or a result of the growing power of the executive in the Province. Either way, Bulyea's appointment of Bulyea as Alberta's first Premier set the pattern for the next 60 years. This was the pattern that has been followed by the Province of Alberta during the time following Bulyea's death in 1943 and through the formation of the Alberta Party in 1984.","token_len":603,"entropy":[3.8256,2.1298,9.1691,6.2593,10.3369,6.9999,1.6512,9.6927,0.325,2.0998,6.4706,0.5272,0.3651,0.4111,3.8412,6.798,10.0335,0.4541,6.5096,0.9101,2.9266,0.1102,1.3519,3.371,1.8485,4.9794,0.1711,1.7605,6.6332,5.895,4.8172,6.1641,5.9932,0.2348,0.0047,0.048,4.1514,0.5008,5.3204,2.2765,5.5673,3.6276,1.1348,1.3819,5.4194,3.534,1.8372,6.7294,1.2996,4.7885,3.4406,1.9062,0.5694,1.6402,0.2487,2.349,0.1805,0.6238,4.835,3.271,2.4517,1.2373,7.8232,7.2153,2.6307,4.1854,0.7905,5.5733,1.1635,3.3439,4.7157,4.3371,1.9319,2.2661,4.1707,2.1606,4.1927,4.6844,1.4715,1.3,5.7835,0.4189,0.0841,2.2773,1.6261,3.7785,2.3706,1.5145,0.0014,3.8763,2.6146,2.6847,1.3634,3.243,2.0434,0.7469,5.4375,1.2652,0.1636,2.248,3.6142,4.8415,5.5025,5.9021,5.4226,3.4216,6.9273,2.5425,1.0784,2.4001,2.7765,0.4858,2.7034,1.4969,1.0466,8.6728,0.3117,0.7241,1.7886,6.2562,4.1514,3.8302,7.1565,4.627,1.7217,3.4739,1.3782,6.847,5.2112,3.374,5.8752,0.0668,1.0135,3.4919,0.9935,4.1908,0.9887,2.282,1.1588,0.8118,0.0033,2.1805,3.7744,0.6663,6.6143,0.7426,0.2624,1.2521,5.4488,3.9208,4.5283,1.411,3.6712,3.2503,2.5207,1.6995,4.2772,2.5248,1.1893,7.661,0.0822,1.6366,3.9399,0.2152,0.3104,1.1151,1.5133,0.0001,5.4608,7.7288,0.8265,4.4108,7.3517,2.5715,4.9347,6.6482,4.164,1.8945,2.7475,0.2659,0.3591,7.1159,1.3049,2.8646,3.6067,0.1509,6.4719,1.2609,5.1592,0.1564,0.832,16.1164,5.2001,3.2213,2.9386,2.5191,0.6081,0.2343,3.9261,0.3041,0.3833,1.1826,5.5509,6.979,2.5708,4.2922,1.7083,5.561,0.6213,7.848,6.2175,1.5083,0.7385,1.9754,4.8582,9.0314,4.8253,2.101,1.761,5.466,0.4739,4.6794,1.4457,5.1931,1.0081,2.4362,4.0612,4.3826,3.3836,4.8757,0.8398,3.5292,3.208,0.2551,0.4616,4.4918,2.762,4.2198,6.8983,2.2038,0.9179,1.4981,0.7838,5.2324,0.5511,0.3816,1.1141,3.313,0.4119,3.9509,3.0813,2.9457,0.9181,4.4642,7.8084,1.0871,2.8581,6.8654,2.1122,1.7261,0.0433,0.916,4.195,2.112,0.3613,3.1005,4.3018,3.3883,2.647,3.0483,0.2754,0.956,0.0001,3.7781,0.0001,4.8569,3.985,1.0943,3.1415,0.1366,5.2078,1.0068,0.9139,2.395,3.6297,1.3681,8.2218,0.1013,0.4498,5.2469,7.3391,0.1472,4.3942,6.201,1.4476,0.2494,1.4715,2.205,4.3402,2.874,2.6314,3.5761,1.0371,1.2528,2.4797,5.2157,0.0848,2.5014,1.0002,3.4308,1.469,6.9468,0.0051,5.5943,1.5559,1.987,1.6773,6.8698,2.3879,1.2063,6.6788,3.4324,0.0727,1.655,0.2312,0.3942,2.2005,3.3944,2.8111,0.084,4.0365,2.5703,6.0906,1.9076,1.1387,8.0845,2.2727,0.8977,3.0,2.5873,0.1814,2.8897,2.6935,3.7544,0.2509,0.5598,0.0001,2.1787,0.0006,1.7994,3.277,0.0208,0.4442,1.3847,4.0361,0.0392,0.1925,3.972,1.4427,3.9455,1.2629,6.0878,1.2892,4.6299,4.5815,1.3358,0.6482,1.0135,4.0298,4.6914,0.6421,5.0379,0.3621,2.1284,0.1887,1.3142,2.5685,0.0403,2.4107,2.259,2.2914,6.3555,1.4773,2.2096,4.6497,4.8034,1.7541,1.5387,3.5719,0.3068,1.6925,3.0771,2.745,0.2992,1.8344,0.1311,0.0514,1.1091,1.9511,0.0248,5.8633,1.1469,1.1846,1.6392,1.5898,0.0938,4.8206,0.7285,2.9363,7.3089,0.0542,0.187,0.6167,0.8457,0.0001,4.2873,2.367,5.524,1.2147,1.3475,0.657,3.4417,6.4631,0.0071,2.0916,3.2036,1.9612,1.1657,7.7681,1.758,0.917,1.0541,2.2161,0.6885,6.7506,4.1631,0.7879,8.8501,0.0729,5.6597,0.5741,1.231,2.7719,3.194,2.5898,0.0004,4.2938,2.2754,1.2065,2.9154,1.3103,1.5595,6.6947,0.0882,0.1224,1.6015,1.2632,0.4855,2.0014,0.0001,2.2366,0.0011,6.6494,3.1185,3.7864,2.0004,0.0211,4.5905,1.763,2.4337,1.8867,3.1045,3.0635,0.7338,6.1935,1.3908,0.4752,0.018,0.0068,2.7354,0.1884,1.1274,0.0002,5.4643,0.3905,0.283,0.0037,1.8173,1.2999,0.1854,0.2336,2.191,0.0289,0.8387,6.6012,2.2751,6.8397,0.2102,5.9237,2.6808,4.5447,1.7735,5.0753,6.9346,4.3148,0.948,2.9501,2.0264,1.0421,4.5859,1.1481,2.6469,1.204,3.3494,5.8035,1.3347,0.5528,1.8188,3.9349,0.0235,1.9549,3.8067,4.1759,1.9626,1.0499,2.1494,0.2802,4.029,2.9121,2.0368,0.0096,1.7774,4.9573,4.0644,0.0887,0.8074,7.6908,3.1658,1.1671,0.7847,1.4971,5.4484,0.0248,0.2001,3.5671,0.0133,0.0037,1.6448,2.1163,2.599,4.1867,0.5043,0.0045,1.3328,2.6856,0.2018,0.2651,3.6198,5.9852,0.8466,6.5581,0.3075,1.4332,3.0395,6.2256,0.0429,0.875,5.4051,1.7205,1.8329,6.178,1.4195,3.5446,1.5426,0.7595,1.5264,1.5188,3.099,0.7096,0.0998,5.4164,0.9213,6.1457,5.7226,1.8757,0.0213,0.0057,0.023,1.6245,2.6444,4.5992,3.8688,4.5961,0.5558,3.5328,0.0197,0.306,2.0272,3.1225,0.9395,4.9246,0.0941]}
{"id":3137,"ended":true,"length":536,"text":"Grasshoppers lay their eggs in pods in the ground near food plants, generally in the summer. The eggs in the pod are glued together with a froth in some species. After a period of time, the eggs hatch, and the larva grow legs to crawl around the plant. It eventually pupates, and then a small (3-5mm) adult emerges from the soil and feeds on the foliage (i.e. pollen). The adult grasshoppers often live for a period of time, then die, and the soil is again covered.\n\nThe adult grasshopper is generally not harmful, but there are species that can be detrimental to garden crops. For instance, the western corn rootworm munch down on corn roots, and can destroy the plant in a very short period. This is usually done by first making a tunnel out of its tunneling apparatus, which allows it to dig away at the root system. Then more tunnels are dug in order for the adult worm and its larvae to feed on the root system. Once the plant is weakened, the worm turns to other crops and can do considerable damage to garden crops.\n\nAdult western corn rootworm\n\nWhen a garden crop is infested with grasshoppers, there are quite a few options for controlling them. First is to use a granular product that can dissolve in water and be applied directly to the soil as a barrier. The products are available at garden centers, hardware stores, or on the internet. While granular products work quite well, they can wear off over time. Second is to plant a cover crop to shade the crop and slow the growth of potential grasshoppers. Many crops that are used in this way in organic production are already grown as cover crops and therefore take the place of the intended crop. Some crops that may be worthwhile to include are hairy vetch (Hordeum cinctum), clover (Trifolium repens), or sorghum (Sorghum bicolor).\n\nThis variety of hairy vetch is a nice cover crop.\n\nHairy vetch is often used as a cover crop.\n\nCover crops can also be harvested for use in animal feeds. These are usually not as healthy as the native forage source, but the animal needs to eat, and the quality of the forage is usually better than it would be from a native plant. Some species of vetch, clover, and grasses are also considered an excellent animal feed. Grasshoppers especially may appreciate those forages a little more since they can be more difficult to digest. In addition, many insects such as squash bugs and caterpillars which are the main target of insecticides can live off these crop plants, so making sure they are grown in organic production is important.\n\nA cover crop can also help to keep weeds down, which in turn means less work for those who are trying to manage a garden or crop.","token_len":603,"entropy":[7.0236,3.8476,2.3283,11.2127,2.7612,0.5221,1.1616,9.5987,3.3573,1.1863,3.4005,4.2937,9.798,4.6967,1.7794,8.3681,2.3041,1.4389,2.7979,0.9339,2.2339,3.2381,6.2827,1.1507,2.2187,1.1184,9.9772,0.7397,2.6319,1.7774,10.2615,0.5059,4.1075,5.817,3.2018,1.7699,5.1488,2.153,3.8203,0.043,1.1081,0.4662,0.91,1.8927,1.3996,1.9876,1.4589,1.1013,5.3804,0.707,6.7174,7.7704,2.8419,5.5225,2.6802,0.9016,3.5861,0.6351,4.1189,8.1012,4.9236,0.0302,2.3983,1.2667,3.2902,3.349,3.4568,5.8621,3.4603,0.6817,1.6396,2.615,0.3086,3.2905,1.7157,1.2895,0.3152,3.5044,1.7737,3.2697,0.3188,0.6072,5.6399,4.5373,5.1738,0.0016,0.0008,0.9977,4.6056,1.2326,1.5689,2.3036,9.1684,0.0033,1.1819,5.2224,2.721,2.2903,2.0393,3.2959,0.1065,2.6291,2.0064,3.782,2.8846,2.3763,1.8383,1.5431,5.2895,1.4291,5.4838,3.0433,2.4134,1.417,0.007,2.0676,5.2369,1.0933,0.0004,1.5883,1.5645,4.4553,3.6277,4.8902,2.1652,0.8821,4.0359,0.4628,5.6635,1.02,2.2985,1.1566,4.3475,0.7939,6.0166,5.4246,0.8687,2.5137,2.3818,0.0822,1.7206,7.1055,5.3105,6.231,0.817,6.9374,3.7285,7.0774,1.0149,4.6384,3.8407,1.5546,1.6241,3.7706,4.7448,1.2862,2.989,3.3204,2.0517,3.4758,0.666,1.5723,2.073,3.2679,1.4425,3.8109,3.6962,0.8658,6.9142,5.5597,1.0085,7.3935,3.7883,0.1056,5.7638,7.5293,2.574,7.6318,1.1211,3.0285,4.5587,1.3411,0.0411,3.6483,6.709,2.7971,0.4709,1.6289,3.5277,0.9632,2.6207,8.1665,3.6236,0.7393,1.5533,2.1552,2.6657,5.2122,0.5701,5.4786,7.6974,5.4879,2.1737,1.1031,0.0328,3.8696,0.9836,0.4186,1.8622,0.1225,0.5052,4.0916,0.7384,5.1017,0.7441,7.5612,0.7675,0.8169,1.8248,6.9727,1.9401,4.3748,4.6575,1.7575,3.3393,5.0537,6.4028,0.2654,0.5983,5.2873,0.7673,0.3634,0.8746,0.0002,5.336,9.6129,0.1878,0.4792,0.547,5.177,0.0003,4.7865,1.9912,4.7135,2.9059,0.6665,6.9764,0.0317,0.3317,3.0141,0.0056,0.0453,0.2496,3.4555,0.973,6.0279,0.0358,0.1192,3.3015,1.7569,3.8616,2.2875,0.3875,2.4225,2.8902,0.3882,2.7076,1.6478,9.0103,0.8724,7.032,2.734,2.2663,5.4876,2.2565,0.6263,1.6146,3.2012,2.8983,2.5672,0.3443,0.3547,1.4482,4.9149,0.6746,5.5833,0.7661,2.0761,5.5156,1.3569,4.3694,2.0232,2.4586,2.1489,1.2748,6.0747,0.1062,0.2135,3.5631,3.8164,0.3973,2.0444,0.3752,6.0017,2.5306,0.1305,0.6375,3.4014,5.1707,0.0492,0.7631,0.678,1.8328,7.2983,1.9706,3.5223,0.0175,1.3002,4.435,0.5756,0.1477,3.9777,1.6002,5.6208,0.9105,3.6478,9.4743,0.3495,4.0912,2.5174,6.4271,0.8326,0.7974,0.5217,8.0821,2.4414,0.0025,0.1199,0.368,5.6445,5.19,2.6341,1.4047,4.7242,2.0173,1.8444,0.4554,6.6376,6.1049,4.3038,1.403,3.9015,3.5079,4.5561,2.3539,0.065,3.055,4.7423,6.3064,3.8809,1.9824,0.0042,1.9762,8.7438,2.0692,0.355,4.7758,2.8933,2.0754,4.3252,0.8747,10.282,1.8193,3.6954,2.5386,11.3811,10.0663,0.4455,1.9964,5.3004,7.1319,5.4196,5.3234,5.4961,3.6783,0.6676,5.7106,0.3943,0.5704,6.078,2.8255,0.5773,0.0307,8.4673,0.5515,0.8658,3.5009,6.059,0.1178,0.0001,0.4103,2.9825,3.4572,0.205,0.0437,4.8238,2.5956,0.0559,0.3239,0.9919,0.0002,4.324,6.1784,0.8403,12.9346,1.4163,0.0037,1.1813,2.6009,4.6263,4.4731,0.0617,2.5122,4.1992,0.0002,4.2762,0.9546,0.1496,0.0031,1.3604,4.1584,1.3462,1.3469,0.3076,1.4462,0.0627,2.3486,0.6832,0.0002,6.5991,0.1915,2.0474,1.2267,0.3308,6.4137,2.8365,3.454,0.6841,6.9923,4.5024,0.8776,3.2186,1.7489,2.2663,4.5718,2.5774,5.5388,0.3229,1.336,4.6689,8.1405,0.2477,6.3813,0.9116,0.5902,3.4877,4.5461,5.9613,1.1669,3.7154,4.3497,1.3451,1.809,7.6604,0.1528,0.589,7.9391,0.0665,1.547,3.8966,2.0542,0.7197,3.8117,0.9248,0.2648,3.9002,1.3326,3.5319,3.086,0.6494,4.1055,2.8068,0.6778,6.1026,0.0064,3.3629,8.8355,0.0232,0.0883,0.5514,9.6553,11.2779,1.3467,1.6747,4.3983,5.6072,2.5224,5.047,0.058,2.687,5.1772,0.14,0.1545,7.7673,5.4372,6.0541,5.3846,4.6312,1.8827,7.2243,1.4612,1.645,7.5719,0.5066,2.0908,1.6987,3.4673,2.7781,0.0833,3.4197,0.9922,3.7497,1.4529,0.3017,2.7777,5.3474,3.9459,0.0021,8.9465,4.9583,1.2891,3.9054,0.0066,0.0001,6.4599,1.3797,4.3637,1.8051,5.1675,0.5056,2.4871,0.6497,2.2689,6.3186,4.0273,2.6354,5.536,3.6644,2.4728,2.5736,6.2843,1.6874,1.6593,0.8381,5.2451,1.7252,5.742,3.9707,0.7343,1.7208,0.4375,0.5274,0.0002,3.6728,2.6074,0.0632,1.3313,0.6049,4.7824,1.4174,2.9384,2.3648,4.8456,2.0174,2.6644,3.1525,0.2894,5.064,2.9625,5.5858,0.7984,4.7174,1.5721,1.6547,4.4057,0.0373,4.8281,2.9073,2.791,4.5497,3.4471,0.3892]}

[were] not only of great importance for the defence of our country, but that they will also be productive of much benefit to the inhabitants of the District of Columbia, who have heretofore been the constant object of abuse and insult from members of Congress, and individuals who have intruded themselves unduly into the halls of Congress with the purpose of abusing and offending the inhabitants of the District, which was an unholy attempt to place the seat and seat of Government in the District of Columbia. ``","token_len":604,"entropy":[10.1068,2.5677,7.6091,0.2045,6.4913,3.0562,1.885,7.0834,13.4633,11.6882,0.9859,9.6669,3.0257,0.5789,1.4116,0.1485,0.5981,1.7439,0.0152,4.0851,2.7642,5.958,6.4561,6.2689,3.349,4.0365,2.9152,1.6476,7.4849,13.3554,1.5572,2.3772,1.0914,2.8513,6.0749,2.2478,7.2696,0.0094,3.054,1.7436,4.4978,4.4097,0.2648,1.126,2.0721,1.0842,3.7382,9.2745,0.5486,0.5917,3.9662,0.1018,0.4808,1.0904,2.2861,6.6502,2.1972,0.0011,1.6531,4.8732,1.4134,0.695,3.6574,2.3947,6.2998,5.8843,1.0806,2.5997,0.6201,1.478,0.085,0.0974,0.0657,0.0068,0.0074,0.0139,0.1384,0.0802,0.0012,0.8342,4.4744,3.2909,2.1481,0.5817,3.3146,1.4295,2.3846,8.5802,0.3737,1.0923,4.2242,1.6864,1.4229,6.1135,0.0367,1.0455,1.7369,1.2939,4.3338,3.421,6.2958,0.0619,5.6032,0.0563,7.0334,1.3055,0.1134,0.825,5.0811,5.8012,3.2547,0.4232,3.9691,3.6882,4.5195,0.8091,8.22,0.1807,0.761,2.5484,0.8656,3.8356,1.2198,0.0941,1.7325,0.117,0.0788,4.6515,2.1776,5.8575,7.8239,4.205,0.9196,1.9974,1.5579,2.8675,0.1904,0.1035,0.0463,0.0052,0.0071,0.0089,0.0477,0.039,0.0021,0.4667,2.8753,2.4301,4.8987,2.589,4.6221,0.6473,2.1186,6.7392,4.4505,6.3032,3.6548,3.4393,6.1983,0.0087,0.0029,1.5326,1.331,2.5247,0.7798,3.4332,1.8077,0.2142,4.7774,0.5121,2.9757,0.08,0.4565,1.9109,1.083,0.7054,0.0002,1.0913,6.463,6.2667,3.5174,0.3974,0.1332,3.5683,1.9645,0.2267,3.966,0.6523,2.2802,1.0962,3.0481,4.5018,2.0593,4.6424,2.1535,1.9087,2.656,2.1802,1.8739,1.3533,5.2489,6.2465,1.2818,3.1706,1.8966,0.022,0.2801,0.1278,1.0533,1.0519,6.2743,2.8306,0.8173,3.7249,1.6649,4.1104,1.3398,2.8105,3.4527,0.1144,0.058,0.0151,0.0034,0.0061,0.0669,0.0521,0.0049,0.0032,1.9509,0.4158,2.7893,0.0002,1.1296,3.4857,2.0144,0.5082,6.9003,0.9664,3.7374,1.6365,0.7398,2.786,0.7937,4.6015,4.0628,1.2566,0.8556,4.9342,2.3399,2.6448,2.3845,0.1013,0.8367,1.2399,1.1717,0.071,1.1554,2.3251,4.5524,0.26,2.6291,3.1665,0.0705,1.9035,1.8195,5.426,2.351,4.251,0.3082,3.4844,1.3744,0.3311,0.2193,0.4522,0.1347,0.422,3.1211,0.2144,6.3914,3.4174,3.3688,0.0455,3.4908,0.4297,7.0141,0.2354,0.5293,0.2389,0.7789,2.1123,1.0818,9.2674,0.7937,6.788,0.2404,5.8339,0.0401,4.5683,6.5325,2.7474,4.5148,0.2842,0.3032,5.7332,8.3183,4.4579,1.742,1.1921,2.833,1.0689,1.177,9.0442,1.9707,2.8081,0.1965,0.3001,2.7974,1.6205,1.0769,2.417,1.7027,4.2968,1.8263,2.1646,3.087,5.5977,0.0769,0.7135,0.7823,2.9233,0.1214,6.5371,1.6264,5.7708,0.558,2.6933,1.7709,0.5281,2.6696,0.8657,1.1492,0.086,2.7151,0.2709,4.3453,3.0144,0.0002,1.1101,2.2448,1.5716,4.2383,0.5994,5.4299,2.6912,0.1453,6.5444,0.0699,0.1323,0.7504,0.6387,0.9926,6.9854,1.0485,0.2347,6.7036,1.0776,0.7367,2.8508,1.7639,4.3743,0.7571,0.3566,0.2963,3.7868,3.5128,0.0911,2.0519,0.6408,1.5107,3.9207,1.3287,3.5712,0.0949,1.9155,2.7936,3.8268,5.7476,1.7362,6.6215,0.7536,5.4876,0.0449,0.8424,3.8778,4.5984,2.9578,1.4318,3.6349,0.317,0.2071,0.0363,9.2949,8.0481,0.7657,0.0133,1.2427,2.9525,1.2541,0.5716,2.4976,0.282,2.0332,0.0953,0.2936,6.2709,1.8506,3.5806,3.7934,0.0691,1.5804,3.2718,0.0075,0.8349,3.559,0.9247,4.1164,2.9598,1.7083,3.3551,0.2231,4.6051,4.0783,7.2867,2.1876,3.297,0.5684,0.8963,2.9038,0.8023,6.6562,7.4241,3.0283,0.1827,0.499,4.4514,0.0096,0.974,5.6925,1.3467,4.7052,0.7412,0.5095,3.4612,1.5089,3.8786,0.5053,3.6566,1.4901,0.8746,4.8437,1.1434,0.4533,3.3511,3.7792,0.7504,4.6728,0.0847,0.2242,0.1096,2.7784,1.8649,4.5908,0.5154,0.0002,2.9747,4.1449,5.3998,3.247,3.9812,3.4829,0.0556,3.101,6.2775,0.0574,1.1807,2.5134,0.0559,4.0982,1.2959,3.628,1.6893,0.1257,4.3231,7.0451,1.8742,1.0387,8.0218,2.436,3.1367,1.7832,0.1348,1.1961,5.0324,5.679,5.2327,0.207,3.4406,2.7217,3.7855,4.5821,2.0101,2.689,0.527,7.0413,0.1025,2.5212,1.7632,0.4546,0.1235,4.1461,2.5106,4.3647,4.6892,1.4798,8.3613,0.3988,3.8877,3.5641,0.3884,0.5726,4.1496,0.1749,0.6624,1.0557,1.6412,0.0029,1.3712,3.8889,1.8293,6.8486,0.597,0.0002,0.6996,2.9394,7.383,2.4345,0.1469,8.2335,0.9879,5.5413,1.9958,6.5708,0.0226,2.2509,1.3153,1.1403,7.8595,1.8377,1.1509,7.7741,0.1584,6.3663,10.9116,0.1067,0.998,0.5637,6.1993,0.5487,2.3122,4.9222,1.5246,1.4913,0.0605,6.1319,1.5613,5.1069,0.8809,4.227,0.2862,0.5443,0.5503,2.5377,4.0419,4.8524,3.8822,7.4663,0.0636,6.5864,0.7077,6.5385,1.6615,7.7053,3.9442,4.3834,0.4198,1.6476,0.9865,0.7882,10.0382,0.745,0.0247,1.6771,0.8007]}
{"id":2660,"ended":true,"length":546,"text":"In January 1959, officials announced that sections of US 12, the Willow Run, Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford expressways were to be given the I @ - @ 94 designation, temporarily, between I -75 and US 12. Although portions of the freeway were already in use, the change was meant primarily to facilitate the building of the Detroit Riverfront Freeway (DRFF), through the Ford Motor Company complex (see map below ).\n\nThis was primarily done not to accommodate the proposed freeway, but, instead, for logistical, traffic engineering and political reasons. At the time, the city of Detroit was experiencing a significant population and industrial growth which posed serious traffic problems. City officials were hoping to build a new bridge to connect the eastern sections of the City with the burgeoning suburbs in Oakland and Wayne Counties to the west. The DRFF was being promoted as the solution to this perceived traffic need.\n\nIn addition to the freeways, other infrastructure improvements included a widening of the Mack Avenue and I-75 interchanges, both of which currently carry southbound traffic. The widening of I -75 was accomplished by eliminating the exit ramp to Mack Avenue and adding a new ramp to I -75 from Mack to Jefferson Avenue. In addition, a new inter-city rail station connecting Detroit with Ann Arbor and the Detroit Metro Airport was built.\n\nIn February 1959, the I - @ 94 designation was removed from the section of I -75 between Jefferson Avenue and I -75's exit ramp to Mack Ave. Later that year, I - @ 94 was also deleted from the other two sections of I -75, between Mack Avenue and the Ford-Edsel Expressway (former I -75E). The I - @ 94 signs were temporarily replaced with the new signs shown above.\n\nBy August 1960, it was too late to reverse many of the changes to the expressways. These expressways were mostly closed to through traffic about three months earlier, after which the new I -75S designation was applied to the segment between Woodward Avenue and I-94.\n\nIn addition, I -75F is the portion of I -75F that replaced I -75F which was originally intended for the DRFS.

{"id":4588,"ended":true,"length":559,"text":"From the renovation in 1980 until 1985 the non @ - @ profit 5th Avenue Theatre successfully operated as a venue for touring Broadway shows. As the United States went through an economic downturn, the theater became known as \" The Last Night of the Fair \" because of its popularity, and it struggled to continue, while continuing a small number of events on its stage, and in 1985 it closed \"officially\" (i.e. did not open again the next year ). By the summer of 2000 the non-profit organization, which had been struggling for more than 20 years, and was facing insolvency, was able to re-open due to a grant from the city.\n\nThe 5th Avenue had long struggled with the high operating costs of owning and operating the building in a building on the corner of West 40th Street and Avenue of the Americas; its current landlord was responsible for all capital improvements while the theatre remained responsible for all operating expenses, including salaries and rents for the 2,000 square foot space. At the time of its closing in 1985, the 5th Avenue had also signed an agreement to move to a larger space in a former convent, across the street on West 42nd Street and to be managed by a theater company with the rights to bring popular shows to the venue. However, the larger, multi-year deal fell apart in February of 1987.\n\nBecause it was a non-profit cultural institution, the theater was undercapitalized and could not compete for major shows with other venues of similar size. As a result, shows for many of the other smaller theaters on the Avenue either closed completely at the time that the 5th Avenue Theatre closed, or moved to the more financially competitive 42nd Street between Fifth and Broadway. The venue attracted the popular musical revues of this era, such as \"Hello Again\", \"The Big Apple\", \"Hair\", and \"Hair\"; popular comedians and performers such as Liza Minnelli, Carol Burnett, and Robin Williams of \u201cGood Morning, Vietnam\u201d fame; and a steady stream of touring Broadway and touring national theaters, such as the Old Globe and the Public Theatre. Many in the audience who would normally be drawn to the nearby New Amsterdam Theatre during the last show on the Avenue often left for one of the many other theaters in Times Square, and the last show held on the 5th Avenue on March 13, 1985 finished with a paltry 658 patrons, including those who had left long before the curtain went down.\n\n5th Avenue Theatre logo\n\nThe 5th Avenue theatre marquee sign\n\nOpening night performance by Michael Crawford in 1976.

{"id":3944,"ended":true,"length":530,"text":"The Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center doubles as a 4 @ - @ star hotel and a business @ - @ friendly conference center. It is on the northwest corner of Michigan State University's campus, on the corner of University Avenue and East State Street (east of Saginaw Street), off the Michigan State University main parking lots (Michigan Hall and Grand Circle, the largest parking lots on campus) and across the hall from the Michigan Union Building; across the street from the Student Union Building.\n\nThe Hotel and Conference Center is owned and operated by Spartan Enterprises, Inc. and has received a number and quality of awards.\n\nLocation\n\n(In order to reserve a room at the hotel, you must pick up a conference call card at the front desk and dial 719-594-5455 to enter the hotel.)\n\nThere has been a long history of hotels and conference facilities here. The first hotel was the Kellogg Hotel constructed in 1923 and torn down in the late 1960\u2019s. It was built in a Victorian style and featured a \u201cgrand\u201d entry and an \u201caromasculpture\u201d (an area or room for enjoying good smells, like incense). The Kellogg Hotel was constructed by Robert L. Kellogg, a businessman and a native of Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. His hotel featured a restaurant and lounge area on the main floor and six large dining rooms. At the rear of the hotel was a grand patio with gardens, fountains and a \u201ckiddie\u2019s garden\u201d playground. On the front of the hotel was a veranda complete with grand staircase (like the one pictured below).\n\nThe conference facility was known as the \u2018Athenaeum\u2019. It was built in 1929 on the first floor of the first wing and was later renamed the \u2018State Board\u2019. When it was sold to Spartan Enterprises, Inc. in the early 1970\u2019s, it was renamed \u2018The Michigan State University Atrium Lounge\u2019. Spartan Enterprises has kept the name.\n\nThe hotel is a four-at-a-time hotel with 16 rooms. In addition to the 16 rooms, there are meeting rooms. A total of 26 people may participate in meetings or conferences. The hotel was used often for \u201ccouples getaways\u201d when the Kellogg Hotel was torn down. There has been a lot of activity downtown in recent years with the university and downtown business area.\n\nToday, the historic building, now called the \u2018Atrium Lounge\u2019 has been completely remodeled.

{"id":3989,"ended":true,"length":558,"text":"Killswitch Engage played the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2006, having already played Australian dates without Dutkiewicz, who was suffering from back problems and needed corrective surgery. On May 23, 2007, Killswitch Engage was confirmed as an opening act for Korn on their 2007 world tour. Killswitch Engage played the majority of the 2007 summer season, including the Warped Tour, and the U.S. Music & Media Expo (USMM) in Chicago. On March 8, 2007, the band began recording its third studio album in St. Louis, Missouri with John Boecklin, bass and drum technician of Incubus. \"Endgame\", the first single from the album, was released on November 25, 2007. The album was released in March and was a huge success as its lead single \"Killswitch\" reached #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Following the album's release, the band toured in support of the album and performed at many major festivals, including All Tomorrow's Parties in Northampton and Rock Im Park in Berlin. The band then toured further in 2008, playing more festivals. They performed in support of Asking Alexandria on their first tour of the States in February 2008, in Australia in January 2009 supporting the bands, All Time Low and Simple Plan, where Mike Dutkiewicz went into hospital in Melbourne in February due to his back pain, after the band left before the weekend. Killswitch Engage completed their third world tour as an opening act for Korn in January 2010. In March, the band played for many of the radio stations and venues that had supported them early on in their career. Killswitch Engage supported the metal group, Five Finger Death Punch on their tour of Australia and the US from November 2010, and in Europe where they supported Metallica in April, and then toured with them again in May. On June 26, Killswitch Engage announced that they had parted ways with vocalist Howard Jones after 12 years with the band. The band released their eponymous fourth studio album on September 27, 2011. Following the release of the album, Killswitch Engage went on a worldwide tour in November 2011 in support of it which included four shows in the United Kingdom at the Manchester Arena. In late 2012, the band embarked on their fifth world tour ; in addition to their own shows, they supported Sevendust on their tour of Mexico. The band released their sixth studio album, \"Reunion\", in March 2014. On August 1, 2014 the band announced via their website that keyboardist Adam Dutkiewicz had exited the band due to legal complications concerning his former record company, Dreamworks Records. In October of that same year, the band announced they had signed with Roadrunner Records, the first time the band was signed to a major label. The band then played two more European shows, and the 2013 Reading and Leeds Festivals as well as several festival shows in the United Kingdom through the rest of the year.","token_len":607,"entropy":[11.1401,9.0126,3.0672,12.4532,2.7114,12.619,4.1726,1.7682,9.1076,0.2677,2.3797,4.2733,5.1268,1.481,5.095,3.6964,2.5637,10.8606,7.9709,6.8795,7.7877,6.37,5.6452,0.065,2.1711,2.2443,1.5938,7.628,0.1243,4.1056,1.595,2.1231,4.7523,7.7645,0.2042,0.5513,5.3879,3.9374,3.3268,0.4023,1.9186,0.2394,9.1909,0.0042,0.8932,0.0141,2.396,5.3337,0.6993,3.478,6.2341,0.1496,0.8224,6.2867,4.6739,5.4565,3.341,5.7596,7.7451,0.0193,0.5577,3.8934,0.0119,0.3462,0.0101,3.0007,2.132,8.8425,0.0298,1.232,4.6399,5.5272,5.4639,2.5942,2.6756,1.7605,8.2592,1.2042,0.0096,1.1078,2.8743,3.0341,4.3946,0.0948,0.4679,0.0537,5.6702,4.5581,6.2518,4.2661,3.558,1.5482,5.3773,1.5618,1.0191,3.7974,1.0514,3.6161,4.0763,3.3709,0.083,1.8352,0.1404,2.7731,0.9613,5.1333,3.7703,2.8009,2.6487,1.3942,0.047,3.7376,7.1074,0.5789,0.6517,0.6315,0.9622,3.5531,5.5928,9.7308,3.1771,6.9497,1.4406,5.5832,5.3479,5.6128,5.719,4.1653,10.5911,2.0994,0.2128,1.4598,5.4587,8.8677,4.5766,3.3484,1.7071,2.1902,1.2773,0.8423,0.749,0.7573,0.2236,0.831,0.5067,0.532,3.5525,3.5467,0.3098,0.2376,0.6492,1.629,1.0377,1.5223,1.9904,1.8997,5.3901,3.4445,1.5505,3.4431,3.703,0.8241,4.4052,4.8027,3.7924,0.0381,1.4474,6.1494,0.1908,2.7607,3.0514,2.1504,0.8661,0.1948,0.264,0.6314,9.005,0.5019,3.4902,5.5866,0.6667,0.7524,4.6248,0.6807,2.1316,0.3491,0.8014,0.4605,1.8176,0.7556,2.9466,3.246,2.0663,0.0713,1.2409,2.3146,1.8397,3.2772,1.1515,3.459,2.9494,1.1143,2.2121,0.2175,6.9956,6.0089,0.0201,0.0002,1.7317,5.2076,3.6635,3.4922,5.3394,10.0475,9.6966,0.4265,7.2846,0.4194,1.8683,1.501,4.6419,1.6922,6.1914,1.4385,3.8381,1.1198,3.4348,4.8658,3.8248,4.129,4.0686,2.8702,2.185,3.4916,0.0174,9.1237,4.4476,0.1123,3.0596,3.5723,3.6915,2.0045,2.2379,0.7871,6.3542,1.3152,3.749,3.4496,1.1497,4.4783,8.1458,4.4773,3.1463,0.3093,11.5947,1.343,6.9116,5.5228,7.1092,3.7912,0.4293,1.5429,8.3731,4.806,2.9443,5.8034,8.0951,4.3782,2.9107,0.0434,0.0009,5.218,3.5954,6.432,3.5827,6.6275,3.2324,2.1733,7.4195,0.0015,2.2921,0.8695,3.1942,2.8856,3.9803,3.4219,0.7199,4.5804,6.9558,1.0307,8.2144,0.8192,2.0321,0.0035,0.1003,0.0333,6.5058,0.6824,2.9938,7.3453,0.0136,4.9028,3.7223,2.7598,0.0083,3.3392,1.5601,0.021,0.9441,3.2492,1.0429,1.1219,2.0703,2.6587,1.8482,1.4754,0.2104,2.6109,5.8555,5.708,3.106,0.3639,7.9754,1.4783,2.9616,3.4492,2.7133,2.0815,4.9322,1.1881,7.7873,0.8632,1.1369,0.5238,0.5111,1.0001,2.5285,0.0031,0.037,0.0226,8.4217,1.3556,8.2867,3.3709,3.8851,9.1186,2.9944,0.0205,0.0022,3.7312,0.9244,3.3517,1.3588,3.1622,2.0145,2.406,2.5012,4.4707,3.4168,2.5934,4.1077,2.5893,3.0765,7.0482,6.3384,0.4706,4.6675,4.78,0.0011,1.9677,3.7952,3.346,2.5387,3.9017,2.0181,1.3695,3.7841,3.389,0.6437,1.554,0.991,2.6992,1.6584,3.7319,0.0574,1.5981,0.0019,0.0056,0.0211,2.7467,1.213,0.2762,1.8429,4.3813,0.1366,0.0802,6.822,0.009,7.3073,5.4828,3.2268,5.2062,0.3872,2.5388,0.554,0.1917,0.5357,2.048,0.6785,2.3077,0.7274,9.0773,0.009,3.7946,0.1847,0.0211,2.5663,2.2878,3.4969,0.1889,1.2349,0.8718,4.2617,0.7657,0.5136,0.0982,1.3636,0.5413,0.5522,1.1296,0.0036,0.0158,0.0276,4.0974,0.3478,2.5569,3.5226,0.2215,2.4891,3.3569,1.438,3.4563,0.3263,0.0024,6.7832,6.2708,0.9669,5.4361,1.9611,0.626,2.3067,1.7487,1.0948,5.3258,1.2177,4.4176,0.5049,2.0178,1.8441,4.718,1.6361,0.2979,1.4797,0.2463,4.6704,0.1087,1.6837,2.6646,4.3385,0.0062,11.8056,2.7271,4.2714,0.1409,2.5889,5.4099,2.529,2.461,0.8549,6.5496,11.1431,4.0188,1.7159,2.469,1.0889,1.5153,0.4884,5.6432,2.1044,2.2048,0.6497,2.624,0.3685,2.0181,0.1593,0.0083,1.7,3.1741,5.4621,3.343,0.8344,1.3062,2.1847,3.4222,0.4666,2.7451,2.5174,2.9902,0.0742,1.3668,2.6649,0.2141,2.3699,6.5892,1.3984,1.3058,0.2468,11.2265,0.0311,5.5956,4.5745,0.5599,0.0896,0.0006,0.9264,6.7748,0.4848,0.0918,2.1928,0.0042,7.1935,2.8879,5.3776,1.2198,6.7412,5.3917,1.6546,1.2761,6.6808,2.125,1.9718,0.5401,2.3243,2.5082,2.5015,0.7509,2.4611,0.0067,0.2571,1.0736,0.228,1.5125,2.7702,1.3141,1.7028,1.6594,8.9674,0.8782,0.2761,1.6709,2.3214,4.0469,5.1761,2.1063,0.5189,4.5387,3.2927,1.0105,1.2605,1.4525,0.1274,0.5229,1.6471,0.6903,3.4875,4.007,3.4383,2.2139,3.7827,1.385,1.8256,3.1173,3.0191,6.8847,9.0663,1.4595,0.0032,0.1719,0.0005,4.886,0.2642,0.1803,4.8194,5.1236,2.1393,1.3095,1.9916,1.0011,0.6946,7.4916,1.8053,6.0975,0.0176,1.0831,0.444,0.1911]}
{"id":3618,"ended":true,"length":587,"text":"Interest in Salvia divinorum has been escalating in the news media, particularly in the United States, where an increasing number of newspaper reports have been published and television news stories broadcast. These reports have been accompanied by a renewed interest in the drug by a much wider group of Americans, including a large number of people who have never purchased or used the drug. The increased interest in Salvia and the increasing number of people wanting to try it poses the question of the effects of prolonged publicity on the potential consumer. Whether through word of mouth, or reports broadcast over the media, how will this effect the buying and use of the drug once it is widely available? Does the attention brought to the drug through the media cause prospective users to try it, or simply to use it more because they have heard of it? The data to answer these questions are lacking; in other words, no one has studied this carefully. In this article, we make the assumption that we will be able to answer many of the questions by studying experimental data in which the effects of drug advertising are directly examined.\nWe previously studied the effect of brief drug publicity given shortly before the first use of Datura or Salvia divinorum, two hallucinogenic plants commonly used in recreational drug use, in a laboratory setting. Using this information, we conducted a short term follow-up study where we repeated the same measures of interest, intentions, and behavior before and at the end of the exposure to publicity. Our major hypothesis was that both interest in and use of Salvia and Datura could be influenced by publicity exposure. However, this was far from a completely controlled experiment. It could not be determined who was the recipient of the advertisement. We were simply in the position of having the drug advertised to a random sample of people.\nWe also did not find any effect on actual use of these drugs, but to be fair, neither drug is commonly used as a drug of abuse. This lack of effect, although expected given that the drugs of abuse are not common in our communities, nevertheless suggests that the effects noted in the experimental data might not be so generalized among drug users. In fact, the results of our experimental findings do not support this broad-stroke interpretation. Despite the fact that publicity did not cause actual use, interest in the drug was increased by approximately 9% after exposure to publicity, which was an unexpected result. This may explain why so many media campaigns have been targeted at this group, because interest in a drug is an important factor in determining actual use. Our interest in investigating the effect of publicity in a more controlled setting will be the focus of our future research. The initial effects of publicity may not always be completely predictable. In the long run they may have a limited effect or none at all depending on the drug being advertised. In contrast, the effects of publicity on interest alone may have a prolonged effect on the potential consumer of each of these drugs. However, the effect this may have on actual use remains to be explored.","token_len":607,"entropy":[3.9968,9.5353,4.6363,4.255,0.0972,0.0073,4.8415,0.8804,12.3381,2.0462,1.9719,6.411,5.8603,2.5995,3.1149,1.3739,1.022,2.3374,0.0508,1.3745,2.1723,4.9168,3.1924,0.113,0.0277,6.7938,2.8158,1.797,2.5453,2.8973,4.3227,7.2037,2.3692,3.4608,6.8048,1.805,4.3936,0.8863,1.487,1.902,3.9528,0.0853,2.069,5.4768,1.6369,0.0942,1.3887,3.9569,4.0858,3.4989,5.1601,2.5898,2.5047,0.1371,2.0058,1.4296,1.8192,2.9153,2.7315,0.7229,0.0563,3.474,1.0205,1.1839,1.9963,6.5837,1.9553,1.333,2.6563,0.4584,0.7906,2.3995,4.8266,0.6793,0.5956,0.7747,0.0004,5.3106,2.046,2.9417,1.8496,0.0098,1.8903,6.1419,0.2568,2.7842,0.6845,6.8991,3.6442,2.1314,0.8826,3.5304,5.5592,0.5356,6.3946,11.8892,0.6572,0.9087,5.4189,7.4605,1.0533,5.6441,5.8539,7.2648,0.1702,0.0001,1.3759,2.0743,8.1699,7.4321,3.5507,0.6345,4.5143,0.5257,6.4431,3.5654,2.2788,2.0179,3.2324,6.4039,1.4785,0.7234,0.0809,1.7169,0.1356,7.3169,0.861,0.8828,4.9155,0.837,1.0496,5.5825,1.2896,7.1502,5.3591,1.0971,0.9049,0.7131,5.8287,1.3247,0.9798,4.5315,10.2159,2.1973,0.1104,3.9541,0.7434,1.9731,0.4921,4.106,3.6876,4.1945,0.2355,3.6647,5.7497,1.3842,2.1765,4.2173,1.3364,1.1983,0.7823,2.6178,6.0196,4.8879,4.2773,0.6936,0.0675,1.3028,6.9319,5.1292,3.481,4.3343,0.009,0.026,4.3011,1.7891,1.7139,3.54,2.1544,8.4446,1.0435,3.0428,2.5348,1.5656,0.501,0.5272,6.6915,1.1844,4.8877,0.0396,5.5533,1.1174,1.9543,0.6199,0.0091,3.2401,4.9254,0.2679,1.4184,0.4541,5.2572,3.3532,9.2234,0.937,3.5178,3.0764,1.7359,2.6864,0.1012,4.6488,3.0026,1.0071,4.5064,3.5956,0.3169,1.7132,11.4702,7.0578,4.1386,0.5757,1.6648,0.0257,7.8326,3.9482,5.9498,7.4549,8.9562,0.789,1.691,2.5662,4.1068,0.2378,7.4089,6.1618,0.1502,4.2184,1.461,0.0011,0.1595,0.0025,0.0006,2.8308,5.5868,6.2428,0.0025,1.0916,4.3015,3.6278,0.451,1.3043,4.064,0.9146,0.7212,1.7132,2.2285,1.8143,4.245,0.2881,0.4587,4.9325,2.6684,3.328,0.2482,0.1181,5.0913,0.6753,5.303,6.4345,2.7619,0.4083,0.0014,0.4866,4.5374,0.8205,5.6496,0.5467,2.2281,5.077,1.2206,2.7677,2.733,11.2307,0.4255,0.261,2.8601,4.7209,0.3418,6.5399,1.1108,1.6567,0.0146,0.5122,6.103,2.5572,10.2463,1.281,3.6796,7.9029,4.3321,0.4251,0.1198,5.9258,8.2963,1.0468,2.7023,1.6839,0.0842,1.6363,0.001,2.2793,2.6283,0.0011,0.0007,2.9162,1.0112,4.1725,0.1046,5.631,4.1273,1.5339,3.5702,0.0065,2.8241,2.407,6.2428,0.0692,4.0589,4.8675,4.7782,0.8887,0.8674,4.0457,3.9302,3.5039,0.289,2.7596,6.2025,1.4168,2.1376,6.4831,0.2837,0.5459,4.5201,2.2481,2.1811,3.31,5.7669,6.0177,0.6798,3.5081,0.4798,2.9718,3.0499,4.8511,1.9036,2.3545,1.7549,4.4129,0.7298,0.2854,1.8319,2.1721,3.2337,1.7918,2.8844,3.9715,0.5787,3.4937,0.7699,2.7676,1.9566,5.6547,1.2846,0.5694,6.3356,1.0939,1.9298,1.8645,5.5602,3.2726,4.5578,0.4708,6.4082,4.1186,3.3711,3.1054,0.8054,2.3629,0.5948,2.8881,2.2678,0.316,0.8819,3.1036,4.6632,0.0045,1.1441,3.682,4.9758,6.9738,4.1419,1.7803,1.8902,4.1782,5.7645,0.1262,0.5702,2.8589,4.4073,1.4719,3.3866,7.6747,0.2321,5.1686,2.3476,0.2866,1.7261,2.6926,8.1301,1.4518,1.8224,4.9391,0.7055,3.0054,1.7787,0.3733,4.2028,6.1928,6.2768,3.7627,0.1417,0.8257,2.6505,2.2194,0.0097,1.7979,3.2024,0.9153,1.4179,4.8641,4.1339,3.1936,0.3113,1.6191,1.9573,8.5018,3.8076,5.7498,3.0402,0.6592,5.7436,0.6985,1.4396,0.0083,6.0053,5.2242,0.5282,2.3572,3.5111,0.5144,2.1767,7.1148,0.1845,1.3797,0.33,1.5962,3.2772,1.772,3.5137,4.6314,0.6846,2.5192,2.927,0.2007,3.6257,1.8034,2.4185,1.4917,5.1284,5.6949,1.0929,0.8584,2.4728,3.3407,2.9258,0.6075,5.7642,0.6302,5.7085,6.5672,2.3892,1.0256,4.3126,1.3794,4.8504,0.9292,1.879,3.9579,6.309,0.2873,4.6417,0.7245,1.2841,4.1409,0.855,1.8757,0.388,2.8129,6.9207,0.3598,0.7067,4.3902,7.5104,0.3939,10.1165,0.8363,1.6455,0.0389,1.9293,3.6687,2.0269,4.801,1.2413,1.1283,5.1837,1.5453,4.9496,2.0085,0.017,1.6731,3.1481,0.5888,0.3117,4.0244,5.2471,4.7725,0.3558,1.8355,2.7153,2.5215,4.0779,0.3063,4.3619,2.3075,1.3635,2.2733,2.0105,2.7239,0.4616,6.7609,0.3971,2.665,1.7949,4.2894,0.7015,4.6148,6.9257,0.0218,0.0011,5.2524,0.1226,0.6213,6.0909,2.9926,1.1132,0.4746,2.0553,3.9061,0.2109,1.5071,1.3517,0.3376,1.888,1.8466,5.9537,8.5149,0.799,2.3563,0.884,7.1808,1.2846,2.8036,1.7666,4.1456,1.6181,4.1869,5.6047,3.1069,1.1088,0.6005,0.4304,4.3909,0.0164,1.8454,2.9826,7.3002,1.3995,0.0406,0.2694,2.8205,0.2322,4.6156,1.042,0.0043,4.9172,0.274]}
{"id":3268,"ended":false,"length":495,"text":"Goater's trial resulted in the offer of a professional contract, but he did not break into the first team. In 1989, Goater signed for Rotherham United in order to play first team football [2].\n\nHe struggled to hold a place in the side, before joining Chesterfield on a short-term contract at the start of the 1990\u201391 season.\n\nIn spite of an opening-day win over Manchester United at the Proact Stadium, Goater failed to impose himself for the remainder of the season and moved to Bradford City [3]. He was a regular for the Bantams in 1992\u201393, but was dropped in favour of Lee Dixon after a number of disciplinary problems had troubled him [4]. The Bantams failed to make an impact as a result as they were relegated after a poor first half of the 1994\u201395 season. Dixon re-signed Goater during 1995\u201396 in a move that brought him back to the club he left in 1987.\n\nGoater's presence coincided with an improvement in performances from the Bantams, but his form gradually faded as he started to develop a reputation for bad attitudes and disciplinary problems [5].

{"id":1780,"ended":true,"length":525,"text":"Gaozong promoted Qin Hui in 1138 and put him in charge of deliberations with the Jin. Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and a large number of officials at court criticized the peace overtures, and advocated the maintenance of war. On 23 November he wrote a draft of an imperial edict to this effect, and on 25 November Gaozong ordered it to be read aloud in court. When Yue Fei objected, Gaozong raised the draft edict up into the roof and threatened to fire a bow and arrow at him. Gaozong's edict was adopted and read, but Qin and Han Shizhong refused to sign it, and the two were thrown out of the capital. (In modern times, the term \"Qin\" has come to mean any of the princes of Jin; this may be a reference to one of them; or it might be an epithet of Gaozong himself.)\n\nAccording to Sima Qian in his Records of the Grand Historian, in 1137, while Qin Hui was still in charge of the jinshi (minister) system, he tried to use Song Duan, a former chancellor, to have him killed and to have the emperor demoted. In the end, Song was able to arrange for his retirement from the chancellor role, but he was nonetheless murdered in February 1138.\n\nAccording to Sima Qian, it was Gaozong's grandson, Emperor Huizong of Song, who recommended him to Emperor Gaozu of Northern Song, but also wrote of Qin: \"It is said that he was a man who made others afraid, both in government and in private. He said to [one of his subjects]: 'I dare not harm you, because my power depends on your co-operation.' He also said to him: 'You are a man of wealth, and you are wealthy because we in the government are able to secure for you the right to mine iron. I give you my word that for the present you should do nothing to disturb my power. But in future, if anyone comes to ask you whether he should support me against my brothers in the next generation, then you should tell him to support them.'\"\n\nThe Jin later adopted the Confucian Five Classics as the basis of their law and education system.

{"id":2433,"ended":true,"length":543,"text":"In the mid @ - @ 1960s, jazz began incorporating elements of rock music, and began using distortion and feedback, partially due to the efforts of Jimi Hendrix, who had strong connections with British musicians like Eric Clapton.In the early 1970s, rock musicians turned to jazz, notably the blues, while artists like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, began to experiment with jazz-like soundscapes, which had grown in popularity due to the growth of FM radio. The psychedelic period of rock began in the late 1960, with the emergence of bands like The Beatles and Jim Morrison, who pioneered use of drug influences while composing music. In 1965, The Beatles released Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, which contained songs that had elements of jazz music and were a break from previous pop music. This song combined jazz rock instrument arrangements with psychedelic songwriting, featuring a variety of sounds and textures. The album also introduced the \"pink floyd\" sound in which guitars were distorted by amplifier effects and feedback. At this time, British psychedelic music, heavily influenced by the Beatles, also emerged as an alternative to the emerging counterculture movement.In the British underground scene of the 1960s, some groups began to experiment with electronic and feedback instrumentation, which grew increasingly popular. Groups such as The Zombies incorporated distorted organ, harmonica, and guitar sounds into their early rock 'n' roll music, which would later pave the way for the use of feedback and distorted guitars.The group Pink Floyd was also known for incorporating similar techniques, and this led to them being dubbed \"The most powerful sound in rock 'n' roll.\" In the mid-late 1970s, the use of effects and distortion developed into a style of music called heavy metal. Heavy metal would later take over British popular music in the 1980s, and by then had developed into many subgenres of different kinds. One early British heavy metal group was Deep Purple, which would later be known for its distinctive sound.Other British groups like Uriah Heep, Black Sabbath, and Yes were also noted for their heavily distorted sound, and this became a major subgenre of music in the latter half of the 1970s which heavily dominated popular music. Also, at this time many artists like Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple began to experiment with the traditional British rock style, and this was very influenced by heavy metal.\n\nAt least 1,600,000 were at the Woodstock Festival, including many celebrities and members of the counterculture.

{"id":1991,"ended":true,"length":504,"text":"Archaeological evidence of the earliest known settlements around Varanasi in the Ganges valley suggest that they began in the 20th century BC, placing it among the world's oldest continually inhabited cities according to archaeologist P V S Iyer.\n\nIn a detailed paper to be presented at the 29th Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America, Iyer, who has been leading excavations since 1984 at the Akshayvat temple ruins at Varanasi, says that the excavated remains from the temple, located in the historic Ganges township, date back to the middle and late Bronze Age (2100-1600 BC ).\n\n\"This establishes Varanasi as an important place of the Bronze Age from which it must have spread to other parts of India and perhaps to the world as well,\" Iyer said.\n\nSince Akshayvat is a Shree, the site is considered a \"holy city\", and therefore has not been excavated in the past.\n\nIyer is in the final stages of excavating its temple, which measures about 100 feet by 60 feet. It is one of the two temples in the city that are yet to be excavated - the second and more famous being the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, located near the Bada Ghat where Ganges water is churned for a drop as part of the Varanasi Rath Yatra festival.\n\nIyer says that although the excavators had access to the Kashi Vishwanath temple until they were evicted in 1993, this site was covered only with soil. But Akshayvat was completely exposed to the sun and the weather, which led the archaeologists to realise that it was a very important site that could provide the details of the ancient city.\n\n\"We then decided to excavate it and found that this was a very ancient site,\" Iyer added.\n\nEvidence from the excavations shows that about 20-25% of the temple is built out of bricks of which 70% is made of clay. According to experts, the presence of this material in the site suggests that Akshayvat was an early urban settlement in the ancient world which may still have existed 1,500 years later during the Gupta age (317-527 AD).\n\n\"Akshayvat would be the most ancient continuous urban centre in the ancient world as far as India and possibly the world at large is concerned,\" Iyer said.\n\nAccording to experts, an archaeological excavation and survey of both the Kashi Vishvanath in Varanasi and Akshayvat in Varanasi should be undertaken.\n\nEarlier this year, Iyer had made the first scientific assessment of the Varanasi area by making a series of surface sketches and then using modern technologies such as GIS (Geographical Information System), photogrammetry and photometric analysis to make maps. The maps showed the extent and distribution of urban centres in this part of India.","token_len":610,"entropy":[8.0313,2.253,4.8545,2.2495,1.5698,4.5836,3.2388,5.8009,5.2949,8.6445,1.965,0.0014,2.6053,1.804,5.1047,0.7612,2.9978,4.8553,0.4865,2.9855,4.2113,1.8934,0.919,5.4571,0.0126,0.131,5.1756,1.6501,7.9825,4.001,3.9237,0.2507,3.5462,0.0035,1.9327,10.5183,0.6302,3.5159,6.8545,0.0013,5.4453,0.4547,4.4301,5.8656,3.541,6.5705,4.1984,0.6987,0.6213,0.0004,3.2417,2.0135,5.1011,2.9801,5.4806,0.111,2.3558,0.383,0.1905,6.4572,0.0179,1.8587,0.7405,0.041,0.1935,3.3459,0.0399,4.1683,0.0749,5.8234,1.8245,5.5524,0.01,2.8101,2.0131,2.0616,1.6399,3.2577,3.5643,0.0012,3.695,5.2462,2.9207,0.6933,7.4884,6.3056,0.8804,5.6202,4.0802,4.2976,8.197,2.645,2.0575,0.0013,0.0022,0.4959,2.769,1.1577,1.3833,4.3751,3.9119,2.3422,3.2782,0.8208,3.5459,3.1295,3.106,1.1237,0.9183,6.4631,3.8123,0.2594,8.2805,1.4192,3.0279,0.6557,0.2983,1.0091,3.7736,5.3429,0.7225,3.2514,0.0982,3.5788,5.3925,2.421,1.4068,4.4761,0.3753,8.2765,0.7943,0.0002,1.2695,2.7113,6.7267,4.6178,0.0075,0.0046,0.2424,3.1753,0.4347,3.2765,1.8065,5.3821,4.1476,0.0065,5.9678,1.3001,3.4621,6.7954,0.1712,4.1478,2.1485,1.7988,0.734,0.0021,0.8237,1.8156,5.6295,2.8309,1.6625,4.2102,2.7476,0.4074,0.3223,1.9474,0.0006,1.4452,0.3236,0.6991,0.0001,6.0006,7.149,0.0083,0.0011,0.0362,0.0058,1.7999,2.4543,9.2158,3.8058,3.2967,1.7107,2.3445,1.3978,2.7849,1.9069,3.7305,6.0613,3.2959,2.9278,2.2941,4.591,3.0058,6.0617,0.3861,4.1096,0.0001,2.4226,1.5028,1.4154,0.9107,1.2841,0.0002,3.0447,0.0011,3.5988,5.0546,1.4261,4.141,0.1654,0.0117,2.0195,0.0223,6.1813,5.2243,1.4311,0.7889,5.7753,2.0458,3.7276,3.0523,2.6752,3.025,0.0193,1.3912,3.2153,1.1252,4.0648,0.0225,0.8187,4.9757,2.363,1.5165,0.8364,2.4488,1.9205,2.2024,6.9278,0.0546,0.1622,1.6902,0.0002,5.4241,0.8052,4.1159,4.7317,5.4841,3.8985,1.0541,0.9281,4.0161,4.7683,4.4393,2.3407,0.2975,2.1025,1.6857,2.1551,2.7997,0.9283,5.2495,7.0505,3.2045,2.506,7.4166,6.3161,1.7196,4.6252,2.0245,8.9125,0.3504,4.1188,3.5613,9.5306,6.7015,1.8254,0.0012,0.895,6.2293,0.0148,0.0073,9.7132,6.6364,0.1056,3.4998,0.4546,0.2248,0.0002,2.8029,0.0023,1.6217,0.7024,4.5693,0.9019,4.2786,3.6402,3.3588,5.29,0.0355,1.1249,4.3622,0.0047,0.1021,0.0182,0.0082,1.0382,6.177,4.1883,1.7553,7.6018,0.0064,1.3498,5.011,0.2187,4.2215,4.9597,1.4048,6.5211,4.4814,1.7287,4.0316,2.0339,4.8573,6.5701,0.0028,0.0009,0.0089,0.0015,2.1604,5.3533,4.7397,1.5175,0.749,2.9365,2.1738,2.3042,4.8559,2.2142,1.8226,4.2142,2.7296,0.994,0.029,7.8353,0.2876,1.8133,0.6934,2.0178,3.3915,1.8097,1.4403,3.5363,2.4942,2.9086,2.8736,8.4053,0.8339,0.9105,3.1514,1.4217,1.0477,0.1018,0.0002,0.8278,2.3597,5.3592,3.1488,0.1923,2.3583,0.001,2.1289,2.2859,3.6066,1.6719,3.6138,1.6543,2.074,1.2229,4.3626,1.1424,1.7539,0.586,0.0008,3.8804,0.0592,0.5576,0.0002,8.498,2.4401,0.7543,3.2442,0.5316,4.0017,0.0876,5.6167,3.3512,3.5505,1.2593,2.9132,0.0361,0.1908,2.0015,2.8004,4.6147,2.9562,0.0928,5.0268,4.4385,5.6425,5.3152,0.2847,1.8137,3.0497,0.5239,2.1371,0.8041,4.5842,0.0015,5.1078,0.5743,1.1543,6.6902,0.0164,3.486,1.4331,1.6737,0.4389,3.324,2.6325,0.1801,5.6454,0.0019,0.0012,0.0086,0.0025,0.6693,3.2054,3.7522,5.3488,1.7283,2.6005,0.9284,4.3478,0.6947,5.3583,3.3236,6.8992,1.9258,2.0305,9.1522,0.1731,1.4097,0.3717,1.4332,6.6395,0.2767,5.4493,7.3875,3.5033,9.4729,0.6893,5.4236,4.6367,2.2168,0.4714,0.1168,0.0002,1.6751,3.8088,0.5938,0.0013,0.0136,0.0025,5.5471,1.9066,2.0848,2.3746,2.9841,8.0407,3.966,3.3581,0.4165,0.8694,3.7506,0.0713,4.3908,3.2895,0.1806,3.7204,2.1458,4.5941,1.176,0.4337,3.2308,0.6681,5.5169,0.0517,0.3521,1.0731,0.0007,0.5585,0.0518,0.2949,0.0002,3.671,0.0025,3.4723,0.2149,6.0433,3.5747,2.8109,5.3286,4.6849,0.8035,6.6119,0.9473,2.7033,0.0055,0.0319,5.4725,0.113,7.6326,0.6512,0.0005,0.0063,0.1279,2.9944,0.0035,0.0021,0.0115,0.0047,1.0537,1.7516,0.0009,0.0094,4.3108,2.3973,2.2078,3.8236,0.7968,0.0002,6.2027,0.6551,0.4915,0.2011,1.9784,0.0012,4.3305,4.5071,1.8249,2.1845,5.627,3.9912,0.2205,0.5615,2.9783,0.003,0.0117,4.4392,3.2137,5.203,1.077,2.3636,0.0024,7.4122,5.4017,2.9164,3.909,3.2296,6.3415,3.2064,3.1594,0.0036,7.2319,1.082,3.048,1.1546,3.3054,0.225,0.6962,1.6332,6.9897,0.5247,0.5442,0.941,5.6041,2.5261,2.1811,0.6342,3.2625,4.2069,1.8496,3.0276,3.9961,2.8908,1.86,4.1372,2.1812,4.7068,0.0154,5.4754,2.6391,1.2477,4.2464,2.7923,0.0083,0.9264,0.9185]}
{"id":3014,"ended":false,"length":520,"text":"Diderot, Mirabeau and Vergniaud briefly participated in the occupation of Constantinople after the end of the war and the latter two ships were sent to the Black Sea in early 1919 during the Allied blockade of Romania, when France was allied with the Ottoman Empire. All three warships returned to Europe in early 1920.\n\nAfter being commissioned at Toulon on 28 December, the battleship was used in the suppression of a revolt on 5 February 1920 at the Marseilles Navy School. The ship remained inactive at Toulon until 6 June, when it left port with a flotilla and joined the French naval forces that were active off Sardinia in support of the Italian invasion of Albania.\n\nOn 14 June, the French destroyers Aigle, Bora and Argo were sent to Albania to support the Italian operation. The ships bombarded Albanian outposts, but after the Italian success Admiral Jean Bart joined the expeditionary force. He landed marines off Corfu and captured Albania on 2 July.\n\nAlthough Tirage had initially been sent to aid the invasion of Albania, she remained offshore for the next few days, before entering the port at Corfu, where she joined the rest of the Allied fleet. Tirage rejoined her sister ships the following day, and the rest sailed on 5 July to the Aegean Sea for further operations as part of the occupation forces.\n\nIn July, Tirage supported the forces defending the Greek colony of Smyrna against attacks from Turkish forces, before returning to Marseilles on 5 September. The ship rejoined the Mediterranean fleet for operations off Syria in December, where the vessels bombarded and sank the Syrian port of Latakia.\n\nOn 14 December, Tirage again departed for the eastern Mediterranean, where she joined the fleet that was blockading Beirut. On 15 December, the ship and the rest of the fleet bombarded the Ottoman port of Tripoli. After the blockade had been put into force, Tirage, along with her sisters, remained of the blockade force for the next month.\n\nIn mid-January 1921, Tirage briefly sailed to Egypt to support the British forces ashore against an advancing Ottoman force in the Suez Canal area. On 21 January, she was ordered to reinforce the naval forces defending the British base at La Reunion. The ship was present during the French withdrawal, which came on 12 March.\n\nAt least until late 1916, Tirage was considered the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet. In February 1922, she was placed in reserve and taken out of service for a refit. Tirage was recommissioned on 14 April 1923 and became the flagship of the 11th fleet for the remainder of the 1920s. She remained in service into the 1930s, however, the ship was eventually stricken from the naval register in 1939.\n\nTirage was broken up at Laval in 1946.\n\nExternal links\n Tirage at the Navy-Marine-A\u00e9ronautique-Maritime Website","token_len":611,"entropy":[9.7837,0.9122,2.607,9.1834,5.2769,0.1448,1.9335,6.232,6.7672,5.2892,5.4587,11.0215,4.7841,0.2374,0.8171,9.2488,0.7468,7.5741,4.5723,0.635,4.1642,0.0051,0.1239,3.3895,2.9845,2.744,6.2386,5.2935,9.2889,0.978,3.3348,0.6535,1.8106,5.4881,0.0582,2.8426,4.407,5.1606,6.0663,0.3967,5.4549,3.1566,0.9981,6.3083,2.838,4.4552,7.101,2.1419,5.6223,0.4775,2.019,2.9181,0.2188,0.4223,5.7292,1.4673,4.4053,3.9793,0.3967,4.1441,1.2307,2.8532,1.1799,1.293,1.0593,0.0044,3.7409,4.5367,4.4673,3.9605,5.0288,0.6701,2.9671,2.9351,4.1532,2.8466,3.1585,2.0546,6.0146,0.3265,3.0104,4.3694,1.8718,0.8801,7.7319,0.0887,3.5889,2.9489,3.7594,3.8293,1.9071,2.657,3.401,1.5284,7.9997,1.0144,6.9554,4.9447,1.6208,1.3492,3.2457,5.1586,6.9876,4.0979,1.2162,0.0007,0.0042,0.533,4.5906,3.1262,3.189,0.5434,0.7638,5.4385,4.4759,3.1713,2.2932,6.8937,0.1278,0.0002,4.0606,4.8223,0.5101,2.8427,3.6359,1.3182,4.1807,1.7376,6.5653,7.3193,6.3025,0.0121,2.0862,4.9104,0.0033,0.3707,3.2008,2.6065,0.5582,5.6817,1.0471,1.3007,0.0002,3.0443,3.6853,2.0822,1.0875,0.9938,2.8388,6.1519,0.0663,4.9318,6.4857,1.8129,2.0192,3.8602,6.7991,0.5889,5.8256,4.9156,2.3404,1.9589,0.2516,5.6334,1.1784,2.8792,0.3473,1.8489,5.0776,1.7635,1.4399,3.7225,10.6788,0.0049,3.6615,0.1486,7.8166,0.0198,2.1688,2.9191,4.9186,1.8763,3.1568,6.0814,9.3939,5.9859,6.6138,12.8826,0.5207,4.6796,4.4308,0.4743,1.1233,3.4796,5.1173,9.7517,6.2974,8.262,1.1565,1.1993,4.2358,6.0649,3.8775,4.1642,1.0565,0.6267,1.0823,0.0002,5.8557,5.2958,12.0877,3.6447,5.231,0.6601,4.6563,0.4091,5.9763,0.4193,4.6162,0.7591,1.4734,0.6676,5.1017,4.8161,9.447,1.6823,1.9438,2.0503,2.2578,1.1224,2.0463,4.3681,5.1234,1.3091,3.1032,3.807,5.4395,0.0138,2.4794,1.0944,0.7782,3.4185,0.355,5.4415,0.0107,0.0879,3.5599,2.4123,0.7065,3.9507,0.2372,6.9654,0.0192,4.4901,3.91,2.6346,3.6246,5.1832,0.7602,1.2008,2.0074,2.3486,4.6348,4.1737,2.9072,5.4959,0.9758,2.4415,2.5368,6.2108,0.0024,0.0006,0.7324,3.6493,3.5281,1.9971,5.1739,2.0067,0.0007,0.3377,5.7254,5.7807,0.4862,0.5604,0.0002,2.4719,3.3157,0.98,2.9948,0.192,7.2989,0.4193,5.3124,5.2865,0.9905,4.033,5.3753,0.172,5.822,0.064,0.0011,2.2365,5.6245,1.0082,4.1435,1.6383,2.0617,5.3563,2.3034,0.1534,6.9996,0.041,2.4954,3.3621,2.6569,0.6749,1.7886,3.1194,6.825,0.006,0.5219,5.2703,2.2517,3.4765,2.4384,3.0312,5.5331,2.0869,4.1151,1.7916,2.7089,2.8172,6.2597,5.5147,0.0019,3.8696,3.9482,2.2249,2.5639,3.1363,0.3825,3.2584,0.0082,1.1265,0.8628,0.0002,2.048,3.2138,2.363,0.2226,2.4957,0.0248,4.2832,3.607,1.9044,1.9382,5.9347,0.1377,1.1462,2.7923,1.0514,0.4999,0.17,4.343,2.5094,1.411,11.7924,0.463,7.4093,1.7294,2.2982,1.644,0.3564,0.2236,1.0057,2.4017,4.522,1.3099,2.1849,0.2483,0.1347,1.9011,7.0024,0.0005,1.259,4.9934,3.2207,0.0671,4.4329,1.9361,3.6879,1.2443,3.8678,2.4897,0.4546,4.8122,2.817,4.1092,0.3829,1.9268,0.0291,4.468,1.601,0.0011,2.0024,4.3878,0.8262,5.0,7.6113,2.0465,3.1695,7.4975,2.6974,1.4459,0.8383,3.3254,0.8533,0.4955,0.0002,1.9353,3.6528,0.1366,2.2905,2.8857,0.2305,1.6506,0.0371,6.9597,4.3368,1.1269,4.7402,2.0358,1.7139,0.262,3.2582,2.7494,8.5276,3.0948,3.8548,4.9253,2.2731,1.5665,2.2401,1.1705,4.6267,0.0107,0.0273,4.7285,0.4265,2.0503,3.3959,0.465,0.2515,1.5189,2.5374,4.0737,0.4554,5.4861,0.5653,4.67,0.6634,4.4136,0.7363,3.3589,4.3271,1.3299,5.9977,5.8574,1.3243,1.9357,1.9503,2.9704,1.7797,7.5498,2.2863,0.3733,4.5828,5.2741,3.1035,3.1785,4.8113,2.6556,4.0649,2.511,0.7606,0.6668,0.0001,3.9864,3.5359,6.8121,3.51,5.2635,0.1691,1.3405,0.0358,1.2697,4.7901,2.2574,2.8177,0.1721,0.3127,4.9253,1.2148,1.1985,2.6074,3.0876,3.1572,0.2108,1.4091,1.0626,4.1866,1.15,3.8036,3.2955,5.1818,3.7874,0.423,0.1847,2.7507,3.1369,7.8845,0.1414,1.3439,4.3224,0.0385,1.3515,5.9749,0.0838,0.0002,1.3428,3.6119,1.8072,2.7535,1.803,4.6217,1.1162,0.8613,0.0847,0.129,7.7137,0.3857,3.6864,5.0247,0.4273,4.2575,0.0015,0.1829,6.806,0.2542,0.2516,3.0115,2.2608,0.8484,0.2479,7.5963,0.8608,1.9595,0.0182,1.5187,5.6611,0.2438,5.4394,2.0471,0.7171,5.3118,6.9535,4.1162,1.9314,5.3418,6.5956,1.715,3.7385,0.738,0.4612,0.0002,2.6028,0.2449,0.0213,1.1007,8.6677,0.6543,3.5629,5.5405,3.69,0.9551,3.966,1.7138,2.2197,0.0002,7.8812,0.4933,1.1016,26.4865,0.1468,5.5318,2.4817,7.1333,7.1268,3.2771,0.1543,2.9278,5.7,9.5005,3.3436,0.1907,4.3976,4.9465,4.2061,1.0273,9.6804]}
{"id":2820,"ended":false,"length":555,"text":"The wake of John Adams'Emmy wins brought offers to Hooper from studios to direct spy and comic book films, which he declined. In November 2007, he signed on to direct the horror film, The Host, based on Stephenie Meyer's 2002 novel of the same name. Hooper signed a multi-picture option with New Line Cinema for The Host, which is an adaptation of the novel of the same name. Although Hooper has had interest in writing and directing superhero movies, Hooper will leave those projects, as, \"I don't think my style is one to adapt to the genre.\n\nHis next film is due out early in 2017, the historical drama The Book of Eli, starring Denzel Washington, that will be co-written and executive produced by Ethan Coen ; as to whether it will be Hooper's next film after The Host. Hooper followed The Host with the critically acclaimed horror picture, The Grey, which is scheduled to hit theaters in January 2011.\n\nHooper has said that The Host would have been more commercial in the U.S. had it been released before the Twilight franchise. As for what has caused him to take a break from helming blockbusters, Hooper said in the interview,\n\n\"Sometimes it takes a while to get out the next one. Sometimes I feel like I need to spend time on less popular films and not just do popular movies, although at the same time that's very exciting being a part of that.\"\n\nThe Grey's production budget was estimated between 15 and 20 million dollars, which was far less than the film's production and advertising costs (80 million), and the film grossed 1.5 million on its opening weekend. The film grossed an estimated 30.2 million dollars on its first 15 day run in the U.S. Despite The Grey's box office success, it received mostly negative reviews from professional critics, who panned the film's dialogue, performances and dialogue choices. Hooper is best known for directing The Chronicles of Riddick, the action adventure film starring Vin Diesel, which is based upon the book series written by Richard Kadrey. Hooper originally intended for the film to have a R-rating, but the film received a limited release with a PG-13 rating. Hooper wrote the script for the horror film Voodoo (2011), but later departed the project after a disagreement with the original director, David Yates.\n\nIn 2007, Hooper was one of nine directors who pitched for the part of Peter in a remake of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Hooper was one of the directors chosen for the project. Hooper's film adaptation of the novel The Grey (2009) made the official list for the 50 top grossing films for 2009 and grossed $170 million dollars.\n\nIn response to Hooper's departure, New Line said in a statement:\n\n\"\"We wish Mike and his family all the best and look forward to working with him again on a future project.\"\"","token_len":612,"entropy":[10.25,0.9428,6.7172,5.8781,0.9789,16.2565,4.9384,8.2873,10.2314,10.4577,2.1588,11.0656,1.9151,2.2529,9.747,4.2065,5.2607,11.075,4.5999,8.0735,1.2253,1.7828,1.53,3.6147,2.3091,5.2045,0.4859,3.3867,4.3773,5.2899,0.2187,1.4663,3.1647,0.9565,0.6434,1.392,1.9364,6.2358,1.4824,2.9369,2.2493,7.3411,1.0278,3.5574,0.0367,4.7058,6.8038,0.0137,0.0271,8.1747,0.394,2.03,0.1194,0.0003,0.065,0.3341,2.595,0.0004,5.5207,2.3285,5.2335,0.2767,0.9063,7.8271,0.669,5.88,0.266,1.5474,1.8621,1.5607,0.5828,0.7838,1.0249,3.1778,5.0144,0.8449,0.0312,1.5952,1.2588,3.2143,0.3302,0.0015,0.0577,0.7976,6.0134,2.432,0.0007,2.6966,3.9903,5.7911,0.3336,3.9052,2.7965,0.2843,5.3459,1.0633,0.8112,6.0915,0.0008,5.4236,5.9998,6.7776,1.0355,4.5081,3.0245,8.2624,3.4516,1.0229,1.9824,0.0005,1.8375,5.0504,5.6588,1.3784,5.606,3.2194,5.4838,2.2704,1.8482,3.7215,2.1471,5.3932,0.0013,6.1925,2.7608,1.4221,2.166,6.0791,0.9363,5.3299,2.366,2.579,1.286,4.262,8.1365,2.3439,1.8814,5.6954,0.3922,4.4908,0.9484,2.5236,6.9809,0.0679,0.0006,1.3234,5.9783,1.6418,1.2118,3.7548,0.0059,1.1422,2.9588,2.9951,0.2406,0.0205,6.2554,3.1341,0.0001,11.0196,5.5891,6.8652,2.513,2.9758,0.4127,0.8879,5.6025,0.0016,0.1105,2.4311,0.9922,5.1071,1.042,2.1438,2.698,3.7071,0.0017,9.7503,3.7925,1.0899,1.6566,2.5045,5.1303,0.5345,4.8624,6.4316,1.5555,1.3345,7.8827,2.7534,1.0523,3.5589,4.0264,0.2826,2.5198,0.134,0.8464,3.8216,7.4257,0.227,1.0438,0.0005,2.4691,0.0013,2.1629,4.0691,0.9042,3.6043,1.635,3.1665,2.8279,0.8056,3.656,6.8457,3.9098,1.864,3.5811,0.0013,0.0916,0.4965,3.4287,1.1195,1.0019,2.9046,4.1377,1.3966,8.8225,4.1478,1.6142,4.8715,1.474,3.3962,5.4931,5.523,2.1632,0.1292,3.9858,1.6825,0.8832,0.3191,8.3835,0.0073,8.4075,0.0034,0.4216,1.3746,0.0017,1.2132,3.3175,3.5244,0.937,1.3944,4.7208,0.0002,0.6055,6.7127,2.1631,3.1462,0.8761,1.0052,0.7109,1.1925,4.4878,4.5624,6.1808,3.4228,0.7109,3.4956,1.6185,3.148,0.2683,0.8126,3.0726,0.2945,5.0453,2.3301,2.0725,6.5781,6.7469,2.199,2.4317,3.7365,4.0969,3.7317,8.7312,1.5993,2.5552,7.3149,4.7719,0.3345,0.386,0.002,4.1824,1.16,4.9514,3.6533,8.9516,2.1212,1.6983,0.0042,2.8267,2.699,0.4727,0.0005,3.2821,8.0987,4.3954,5.4191,5.4223,2.2259,3.4286,6.4161,7.3895,1.0197,0.3969,0.2959,0.3635,1.0295,1.7405,2.2583,4.5559,1.4441,0.0671,1.1614,4.4968,0.5388,2.6407,5.5891,5.9953,3.0618,4.4579,7.4741,0.5718,4.2586,1.5328,2.8398,2.9488,5.1378,0.0435,4.6751,0.2556,2.0941,0.3906,5.9276,1.6328,1.848,0.5206,0.6875,1.7463,2.31,2.3582,0.0132,3.9171,0.3898,5.863,2.4875,2.3417,0.0201,1.59,1.9779,0.2943,1.9387,7.9808,5.1802,1.9433,2.8099,1.4105,0.1242,0.001,0.016,0.745,6.6019,4.1975,1.2459,0.3424,5.8295,0.0325,1.1382,0.1756,2.5256,4.4724,6.1904,0.4559,0.0989,1.6099,10.9509,1.2511,1.5531,2.2824,7.902,0.5792,0.916,0.4898,2.599,7.3077,1.1515,5.4354,0.9183,4.0285,4.4439,0.5237,2.9951,0.0012,3.9549,5.0252,0.0177,0.1871,2.5885,2.2847,6.2705,0.0379,2.9216,0.0384,0.0009,0.919,2.4004,5.9003,3.9204,1.6283,2.2691,7.6448,0.0051,1.1841,2.8373,3.7696,2.3809,4.1486,0.9279,2.3554,4.408,4.1009,0.0985,4.9047,7.1817,3.9184,1.0122,3.2442,0.001,6.2568,3.581,2.6688,1.1773,1.0496,0.0765,2.4571,0.9393,7.1865,1.1545,1.301,0.9117,0.5635,2.2496,1.6499,1.8688,1.4513,7.85,2.0462,3.4973,1.2783,3.2873,0.2204,0.026,0.0862,0.9478,3.2164,0.0011,4.4761,1.5818,1.1758,0.899,1.3806,5.6165,0.6901,8.1816,2.3411,3.7875,4.426,0.5675,2.8223,4.2716,6.7052,1.1002,0.1556,1.3135,3.1103,4.2495,0.4623,2.6534,5.3098,1.7069,1.1186,3.374,5.077,0.6942,1.2732,0.0003,2.636,4.2213,0.1083,0.565,0.0018,2.5914,4.4683,0.0155,5.3158,1.432,1.9346,5.9095,3.7237,1.2786,3.6851,0.0262,4.9465,6.9573,3.1994,5.3323,0.052,1.7484,5.2676,0.0084,3.6442,1.118,1.5385,2.3501,0.0013,2.279,3.2347,0.0085,1.8581,3.1555,4.8849,1.4088,0.724,3.6562,2.4536,2.1038,0.0016,2.1488,4.3016,3.2973,0.3348,1.5592,1.6025,2.4597,5.403,3.6472,3.7557,0.1885,5.3928,2.8827,6.6926,2.8302,2.2748,1.7694,6.4852,7.6853,3.1682,0.0104,1.2461,4.7325,3.2415,2.8512,6.5979,0.0997,1.208,6.0211,0.1764,4.3747,0.7865,1.6532,0.0004,2.5463,6.3555,0.0154,4.9814,0.0027,0.0887,3.1277,1.0911,4.4492,0.0046,4.9276,1.4822,0.4272,0.1372,2.4301,0.6128,0.0002,7.4209,1.5737,4.1796,7.3559,2.8217,2.3676,1.4239,2.2633,0.0348,0.1265,2.4719,2.2544,0.0029,0.0095,1.077,0.2356,0.602,1.364,1.86,2.461,4.4988,1.9211,5.702]}
{"id":3825,"ended":true,"length":543,"text":"Charles II, who promoted a number of Roman Catholics at court, granted Wright a measure of royal art patronage. In 1661, soon after the coronation, he painted a formalised portrait of Charles II on the occasion of the king\u2019s marriage settlement to Henrietta Maria of France. Wright spent considerable time on details such as the king\u2019s sword, the king\u2019s crown and the King\u2019s crown.\n\nIn the course of 1663, the king\u2019s painter, Anthony Hill, was removed from his post. During these years, and also up to the summer of 1664, Wright had not been idle. In 1663 he painted a portrait of the future Charles I on horseback, probably commissioned as a royal ensign. In 1665, on the occasion of the accession of Charles II, he painted a second formal royal portrait of the king, this time wearing a plain cap without the imperial crown.\n\nWright\u2019s work shows that he was in excellent health both mentally and physically right up to the end of his life. He was known to have a number of long conversations with his patron, Charles II. He also enjoyed the same friendship with the poet John Milton and he appears to have visited his wife Anna Bekker in the Netherlands.\n\nHowever, he was in ill health towards the end of the year 1666. By 17 August he was dead, although the cause of death is unknown. Wright\u2019s body was interred at Norwood, his last residence, but his body was later moved to Saint Martin\u2019s-in-the-Fields church (part of the present St Martin-in-the-Fields churchyard), and now lies in the east of the nave.\n\nCharles II \u2019s portrait was last seen in public in the early 19th century. In 1836 it was sold to Sir Thomas Smith, the Scottish MP, for \u00a3100. His son donated the portrait to Oxford University, which subsequently acquired it in 1877. On 3 April 1913 Thomas Campbell Scott, Professor of Modern History at Oxford University, wrote an article entitled \u2018Remarks on the Personal Appearance of Charles II \u2019. In it he made what appeared to be a disparaging remark about the quality of the artist\u2019s work, which was subsequently edited and published without Campbell Scott\u2019s knowledge. The original has now been lost, although a facsimile has survived.\n\nHis work was not widely known except by the connoisseurs in royal portraiture. It has since become much more widely known, especially since it was one of eight portraits taken from various studios for the first exhibition of royal portraits at the National Portrait Gallery in London in 1984. Several pictures from the collection of Oxford University, two portraits by Joseph Wright and the other seven by other members of the King\u2019s Painter Court, are also featured in that exhibition.

{"id":3700,"ended":true,"length":553,"text":"Wales British Home Championship ( 2 ) : 1907, 1920 = Jean Abraham Grill = Jean Abraham Grill ( 21 July 1736 \u2013 12 March 1792 ), sometimes called Johan Abraham Grill, Johann Abraham Grill, Johann Grill or Johann Abraham Grill (1736\u201392), was a native Dutch merchant who spent considerable time in southern Wales where he was associated with the Welsh, the Welsh language and Welsh studies. He emigrated to England in 1770 and then emigrated to South America in 1772.[1] He established one of the first businesses in St John's, Newfoundland. He and Elizabeth, his wife and business partner, later moved to Nova Scotia where they operated a successful trading house until his death in 1792.[2]\n\nJean Grill was born in Rotterdam, North Holland as the sixth child to Abraham Grill (or Grillis) and Anna Maria van der Veer. He entered business with a business partner, Abraham Cornelis Banninckx in Rotterdam in 1756. The two partners had two children together, Maria and Cornelis.\n\nThe business was highly successful and Grill was sent as a young man to South America, where he first visited British St. John and then became a trader in Newfoundland. In the 1770s, Grill moved to England. In 1778, Grill, his wife and children moved back to Rotterdam. When their ships were returning to port, they often made detours to South Carolina and Georgia to trade with the local Indians. Grill served as an assistant to Johann Leopold Ziegler of the Dutch East India Company. Grill served as the agent for the company for the area around St. John's. He helped to establish a trading centre on the west side of the Newfoundland peninsula and provided support to British forces in this area. Grill had also been a member of the local government of the French-controlled St. Pierre and Miquelon island.\n\nAfter the Anglo-French war began in 1792, Grill had left St. John's for Charleston, South Carolina, to visit his sister, Caroline. Grill and his wife Elizabeth returned to St John's later that summer. Grill remained in St John's as a merchant until June 1793.[3] Grill was later called as a witness for one of the plaintiffs in the action that sought to protect the rights of the French settlers in St. John's. Grill was one of the original members of the St. John's Board of Trade.[4]\n\nHis wife Elizabeth and children were left in St. John's. Grill returned to St. John's briefly in 1798. Elizabeth died on 11 June 1799.[5] Grill and his family apparently died in St John's. On 25 December 1795, British forces burned the French-American Trading Post on St. Matthew's Island in St John's harbour. This was a precursor to the Treaty of Ryswick, which ended the hostilities and ended the French claim to this island in the Bay of Fundy and all of Newfoundland.","token_len":615,"entropy":[9.3708,10.855,6.8124,8.9579,2.9832,9.8556,2.9999,5.5953,11.7803,3.4945,4.6785,8.3718,11.8543,9.4269,13.7388,9.4702,4.5461,0.7101,0.9055,2.5126,6.7173,7.7168,4.5894,5.2309,2.5717,4.3838,2.7984,1.492,3.6473,4.2838,9.3969,1.5602,7.8976,0.4963,3.5807,1.1838,2.2732,6.7773,0.8925,0.5042,1.2872,2.579,6.6235,4.3389,1.1966,1.7846,0.4543,2.1251,5.0428,3.6135,1.8718,6.3722,1.2382,2.0031,0.9791,6.524,5.3682,3.5233,2.1815,4.882,4.8189,0.1042,0.4438,5.7178,4.2039,5.1316,0.2046,2.1219,5.1498,0.055,0.8052,4.5317,3.7837,2.8516,2.3938,4.2294,1.226,2.6053,9.0206,0.3817,1.1616,6.8189,0.0025,0.3058,1.0051,0.7062,0.5759,4.5678,1.1638,4.7403,7.2236,0.0007,0.2239,5.6857,2.8915,1.0513,0.5134,3.3032,6.3522,1.8593,0.0776,1.7291,4.5264,5.5099,0.1574,0.1389,2.0941,4.4839,0.3581,6.3422,3.8789,0.2743,1.8459,6.2363,2.3632,1.2623,5.1349,8.3144,4.2937,2.5206,0.431,2.3659,6.5313,0.1388,0.6305,4.6176,3.0172,0.2072,6.1672,0.0006,1.9866,0.9978,4.7559,1.3887,5.1239,4.6971,2.4068,4.0455,3.1403,0.1041,0.3454,0.9421,3.3421,1.187,0.3816,0.0584,0.9811,0.0009,5.4677,7.9692,1.4938,1.3709,0.5872,6.3776,0.6937,0.0038,0.7355,5.5053,1.7642,5.9108,4.2335,5.1237,0.5887,4.528,5.7566,1.0775,2.5936,6.8289,6.9519,6.5424,1.5649,1.2718,6.0956,5.5301,8.4873,1.3457,4.1413,3.4295,1.6399,1.2315,5.6742,3.1743,3.1978,2.9413,4.2814,2.8637,2.0068,5.8399,9.0874,3.4896,6.0959,5.432,5.2506,3.2274,7.2813,3.476,4.8353,0.0121,0.0033,1.1635,0.42,4.7695,1.1196,2.5334,2.5877,4.9338,2.9555,3.0822,0.7548,2.1797,1.2758,6.2583,1.1761,6.7758,0.0479,1.7718,2.6211,0.0002,2.9885,3.7218,1.9979,5.7973,0.1882,1.4478,3.6302,2.6249,6.447,4.9338,0.8709,5.4212,1.4857,0.3452,5.6082,0.352,2.4722,0.4346,0.1894,5.5173,4.5366,6.8426,7.8556,2.1138,1.1609,5.1669,1.3813,4.0026,0.831,3.7896,1.7705,5.6238,0.6949,2.3908,3.0785,2.6772,1.3354,0.1009,0.8148,1.8577,3.4676,0.3135,3.8417,3.1286,2.2847,0.4676,3.1973,0.6818,2.8647,4.7009,3.0389,0.6275,0.5112,3.4208,1.7306,3.238,0.1189,1.8048,0.003,0.0006,1.92,4.501,4.4515,7.1463,1.2967,5.9363,0.8131,4.1672,0.859,1.659,7.5116,4.1038,6.4228,0.3708,0.7214,4.0244,7.308,1.6696,4.84,1.4856,3.7003,1.3174,1.5912,4.2212,4.373,0.6853,3.4535,4.6201,0.7782,2.5999,3.0221,1.1469,5.9966,9.1148,3.4793,0.004,6.7246,3.4125,0.1152,3.0842,1.3376,3.4362,4.1289,0.346,0.0483,1.8539,2.9214,3.6627,0.5791,2.3637,6.1403,1.1332,1.3158,4.2668,2.9705,2.5924,8.5031,4.5186,1.5964,0.6108,0.1748,0.3529,1.5926,1.8098,5.5451,1.7715,1.8502,1.947,1.9287,6.7964,3.2301,0.9677,4.0031,1.7267,0.0237,1.2,6.3673,5.3367,1.9986,4.2467,5.1401,1.0841,5.1838,5.3188,1.2081,5.3924,0.795,0.566,2.6843,3.7139,4.2521,1.9113,1.5187,1.9695,0.0278,0.3188,5.1873,4.1628,2.5471,2.579,6.3351,2.7196,5.9211,3.2424,0.0963,6.5497,1.9684,0.8184,0.0371,0.0072,0.0042,4.2717,1.3573,0.7856,0.0002,3.822,1.8284,6.9458,0.0396,2.3383,1.8588,5.0827,0.4227,0.3077,4.2149,0.2427,0.888,3.9326,5.7768,1.4521,0.0845,0.2096,0.492,1.7478,7.1979,0.4644,0.5087,0.0083,1.0645,2.9994,5.1776,0.962,4.465,1.3807,5.1339,1.9938,2.4455,2.9326,2.0364,0.6731,5.3479,5.0571,0.187,0.9612,4.3148,0.0236,6.0786,0.7252,4.2297,1.5838,2.8219,4.09,1.1112,0.4983,2.1889,0.0085,4.1017,0.7515,1.9415,0.8983,5.5791,0.794,1.8276,3.6852,0.1387,0.0304,3.3071,1.6685,4.4271,5.4129,3.4064,1.5019,5.1139,2.5963,5.6976,0.0738,0.3126,6.6787,0.6472,0.4649,4.95,4.4635,5.1743,0.9618,5.5464,1.0781,2.9285,0.0746,1.3476,3.3414,3.0069,1.4615,1.2028,0.1715,0.1413,0.0249,1.2327,2.3997,1.2891,3.7143,0.0112,0.6887,4.6684,3.663,0.0287,0.2272,1.8044,0.0875,0.2341,0.0648,3.5747,0.2819,2.2095,3.2258,0.099,0.032,0.5922,0.0002,4.7649,2.8319,2.0426,3.2271,2.4294,2.056,6.8296,1.7415,0.8293,0.3478,0.028,0.0075,4.0694,2.9322,4.5267,0.1736,0.6114,0.3796,0.0373,0.0112,7.279,0.8525,0.6556,2.9592,1.9586,5.1095,2.6681,2.9783,4.1695,2.4573,0.4802,1.0573,2.5488,0.0822,0.0195,2.6249,2.713,0.208,2.0781,8.3323,2.7388,1.5392,1.5822,4.1349,0.0036,2.8003,4.5472,3.9486,3.1029,0.4664,4.402,0.3415,7.8031,2.8646,6.1587,1.2237,3.7999,3.4193,6.4659,8.5135,1.9447,2.3585,1.6697,0.1929,8.1796,0.5316,0.7109,1.327,1.9482,3.2142,0.0108,6.7594,0.9454,4.5456,1.6754,1.801,6.5682,0.147,0.3356,7.7016,0.0443,6.3675,8.3124,4.6364,1.76,0.7084,2.8146,0.4567,4.719,3.1687,2.6867,0.5054,2.0052,6.2639,1.0575,5.7849,1.1121,3.0191,2.8885,6.799,0.0315,4.0602,0.42,3.615,6.0929,1.7168,1.9303,1.0245]}
{"id":4869,"ended":true,"length":558,"text":"Geologically, Portland is separated into two areas ; the steeply sloping land at its north end called Underhill, and the larger, gently sloping land to the south, called Tophill. Portland is one of the best known places for its volcanic activity. It is home to an active volcano, Mt Hood. It is thought that a small submarine shield volcano, formed out of the thickest part of the North American continent (Ogden, 1977 ), called the Columbia Plateau, may be the source of the magma that heats, and continues to heat, water in our oceans into steam, creating the earth and all of its life on it.\n\nSome geologist believe that the entire surface of the earth is the surface of a huge volcano. The lava in volcanoes. In volcanoes, magma, not only heats the rock, but it has dissolved gases that bubble to the surface. Most volcanoes are called cone mountains. They have a flat rim that is at or near the top ( and that is made of rock containing gases ). Once the volcanic activity subsides, the gases rise to the top, where they form the cone.\n\nFluid magma is what makes the magma. Volcanoes can erupt in a number of ways. One is called a fissure eruption. Volcanic gases, which are not in solid form, ( they are less dense than solid rock ). When they come out through a fissure in the earth's crust, they can produce hot vapor known as pumice, which then cools into stone. Another cause of volcanic eruptions is the sudden production of pressure. When underground rocks are suddenly pushed upward by the pressure from above, these rocks are then cooled by the air above and solid, and form a cone-shaped mountain. Sometimes the cooling of these rocks produces volcanoes.\n\nVolcanoes are geologically significant because they are the biggest repositories of carbon dioxide, and the most explosive place on earth. They are the biggest producer of aerosols, which contain sulphur and other elements. There are other factors that make volcanoes so significant. For example, carbon dioxide traps shortwave heat, making areas warmer. That warming increases evaporation, which increases cloud cover. This leads to less absorption of short wave solar heat ; meaning that more heat is retained in the earth's surface. This makes the earth's surface colder. This can cause the ice caps to melt and change the climate on the earth's surface. This is why scientists classify volcanoes as being very dangerous, since in a relatively short time they can cause major climate change.\n\nVolcanoes are very old, even though they are not visible from the naked eye.

{"id":3918,"ended":true,"length":550,"text":"She is one of the foundational works of fantasy literature, coming around the time of The Princess and the Goblin ( 1858 ) by George MacDonald, William Morris'The Wood Beyond the World ( 1876 ) and Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass ( 1860 ).\n\nShe has won the Nebula, Locus, Hugo, and Bram Stoker awards, and been short-listed for the Newbery Medal ( three times ) and the Carnegie Medal ( three times ).\n\nI grew up with stories like those, but there she was, this woman who loved to tell stories, this creature who never married, never had kids and lived for her pets and her work.\n\nFor me, she is the model of creativity, independence, and determination in her own time.\n\nBut on to Harry Potter.\n\nLike Dickens, Rowling has become a kind of icon for an era of youth.\n\nHer books speak to the dreams of childhood and the wonder of life itself.\n\nThey speak of magic, goblins and dragons, Hogwarts and the Hogwartians, and all the things that make life worth living.\n\nThese books were part of my life for well over a decade. I loved them.\n\nThey brought me the world of magic without ever crossing the bounds of the ordinary.\n\nThey taught me lessons in friendship and responsibility.\n\nThey introduced me to wizards and muggles, witches and wizards.\n\nHarry Potter is more than just a fictional novel.\n\nHe is a part of my soul, something I will pass onto my children and maybe even grandchildren.\n\nHe was real and so was I, we were one.\n\nAnd now he is simply a memory.\n\nAt the time of the last book's publication, Rowling was on the front lines battling leukemia.\n\nHer condition worsened and it was decided that the novel would have to end as it had begun - unfinished.\n\nWe, as the readers, were left wondering who would fill Harry's shoes, but now, four years later, we are left with the empty place that Harry is likely gone for good.\n\nOne of my sons had recently started reading the books for the first time, so we sat down to watch the last film.\n\nI looked up and Harry was sitting there, and I thought he looked just like an old friend.\n\nThey got the voice just right, and the acting was, of course, outstanding.\n\nBut what I came away with were some words by Dumbledore that Harry had delivered in a previous film - \" I love you, and always will. The world will not forget how you loved.\"\n\nThese words are the epitome of hope in the face of tragedy.\n\nBut it was not Harry's voice that came forth.\n\nInstead, a young boy called Sam Clemmett delivered the lines as an elderly Harry.\n\nI will always see the ghost of Harry Potter in my imagination now and I think that is the greatest gift of all.","token_len":615,"entropy":[3.5381,4.077,0.0627,0.7009,9.7186,7.1456,0.1993,8.1302,1.2351,1.1845,7.8017,7.4976,2.7918,1.2668,0.63,2.8926,4.4507,2.8014,0.1873,7.7651,3.7204,10.9602,3.9665,2.3257,2.3451,3.9302,5.422,1.6399,6.3307,4.6987,4.961,10.9785,8.6301,8.6305,0.8407,4.8246,0.8055,1.3065,4.5325,0.5199,1.5871,7.6004,0.3908,0.0816,9.6117,0.1136,0.5754,0.1201,0.2417,5.2591,0.4506,2.7575,0.1274,4.7324,2.2576,4.4519,2.4162,3.6278,3.4189,5.7469,0.0294,1.357,3.2663,0.7752,1.3638,6.553,0.2182,0.0001,0.8779,1.529,1.2768,5.2788,6.6514,5.1587,0.0025,0.4496,1.6391,4.6749,0.9423,4.4243,2.3756,8.5276,1.5015,1.5491,0.9166,0.8547,5.8267,2.1345,0.5282,1.859,0.0152,0.5862,1.1486,0.0002,5.1116,5.8475,0.0021,2.0928,6.6601,2.374,4.8061,1.7962,2.3336,4.1629,8.1907,0.7348,0.9833,6.1992,3.7688,1.4786,4.0218,1.7146,2.1337,1.2095,1.3312,4.441,6.1431,1.2487,4.4069,6.9782,0.9258,3.2251,1.8113,1.92,2.0469,3.7941,3.8363,2.9102,8.7122,2.1958,2.1093,6.2195,0.7245,1.4118,0.0002,5.0621,1.7914,0.4814,2.4722,1.8777,1.6476,6.6925,1.0403,5.801,1.4087,7.3207,0.6548,1.2316,6.1112,3.175,3.1545,3.3534,4.4218,0.7691,0.9365,0.0002,4.62,5.7372,4.6558,7.3217,0.1108,1.4128,0.5599,0.0001,5.3302,8.1017,0.5485,1.2393,1.4896,4.5423,1.0497,4.9251,0.1093,6.1591,2.0692,5.6137,2.7319,1.1663,6.9268,2.5711,2.0492,0.0001,2.8076,2.7392,7.7708,0.835,1.6218,6.8008,0.553,5.0039,1.7095,1.429,5.8488,0.3063,2.7284,4.0578,0.5819,0.5126,0.0001,3.3788,3.2434,1.8404,4.4625,0.7596,8.4403,1.4707,2.4868,0.5641,7.1064,0.6573,1.5593,8.9783,2.134,9.9646,0.6215,2.2011,3.7414,0.72,3.0177,0.625,2.1728,1.9503,2.7819,0.0184,0.3349,0.1204,0.0001,4.285,2.368,3.9964,4.3193,0.0372,2.4704,2.6486,2.6243,6.3653,0.0531,0.9645,0.4297,1.1027,2.2832,2.972,0.8062,1.326,0.867,0.0002,2.4778,4.7215,0.9083,3.3376,3.3641,1.7843,3.251,7.2271,2.8957,6.2563,1.851,8.041,0.072,2.6938,4.4775,0.4933,0.3368,0.0001,1.7149,2.8699,0.0257,6.1807,2.8112,5.0153,1.0655,5.7971,1.6345,0.4101,0.0001,0.7122,5.3698,0.0503,0.0726,6.5075,0.95,7.9593,0.5328,0.0001,1.2399,3.1296,0.152,0.0596,1.5017,0.0991,0.0001,5.0487,0.3237,1.571,5.1702,0.4293,1.1863,0.5169,5.8779,3.9487,0.6151,1.1866,0.0001,3.278,0.4841,0.9439,4.1703,0.04,1.1834,5.1393,1.3375,5.435,1.11,2.0837,6.5237,4.4905,2.1381,0.6441,1.7593,7.6563,0.9267,2.5027,0.5302,0.1307,0.0002,3.0644,3.5764,7.5854,2.6905,5.4207,2.5578,1.2064,1.8528,7.713,2.2639,4.2798,1.7989,0.2606,0.0001,2.3105,2.4612,2.3469,0.7332,7.2254,1.7677,5.7799,0.9211,0.284,0.0002,5.6369,1.3475,4.1401,1.4326,2.1616,3.9992,2.4689,2.7663,1.204,0.3346,1.7366,1.3373,4.6376,1.2275,4.3728,0.9657,4.8572,8.3845,1.2714,0.73,0.0001,2.2469,6.8173,4.0304,1.734,4.6443,1.4823,5.5005,0.9801,3.0425,6.5351,0.8577,2.5483,0.1062,3.3135,4.2415,4.4376,1.341,3.1603,6.0509,10.1149,0.7098,0.172,0.0002,4.6706,5.6002,1.7201,3.8723,2.3646,0.5421,1.7261,3.1246,3.3274,4.1148,1.2773,4.6687,4.6478,0.488,0.9641,2.1225,4.4566,4.4297,2.0782,6.0428,0.1995,0.4034,0.051,1.6929,1.3864,4.2474,1.0703,1.8207,7.3362,6.997,2.2409,3.2514,3.3254,8.7883,9.6939,2.9222,3.0344,0.2261,0.1133,0.0002,5.3633,1.3041,1.6395,4.6434,4.3418,4.393,4.1521,2.1707,1.9099,2.2558,4.0109,0.7839,0.1858,0.0005,1.3421,2.6954,2.1493,4.1643,0.7955,1.6557,2.3601,1.6098,4.6984,5.1421,1.7034,0.2182,0.0001,2.5291,4.6698,1.7257,1.952,5.3914,1.2768,2.345,2.155,1.17,4.074,1.1303,2.3394,3.7203,3.1166,3.8071,0.3562,5.6641,0.9523,2.7577,0.7718,0.2014,0.0002,6.1703,5.9722,3.5855,7.7044,6.983,0.2466,1.2342,1.0386,2.8801,7.3842,0.8264,6.2188,3.9752,0.0184,0.0097,4.6346,0.2437,0.1286,0.0002,2.1063,3.5323,2.3268,6.214,1.466,0.3343,4.9246,3.7853,6.4847,7.1941,5.7446,1.2024,5.1358,2.0307,8.1731,1.987,2.0516,5.6019,3.7813,2.4264,2.6486,8.4797,3.9996,0.4624,1.1879,4.1992,5.3919,0.1839,2.9185,5.3323,3.854,1.5808,3.3184,3.5781,6.318,1.6462,4.8924,6.0986,0.1389,0.0002,5.8615,0.9351,2.2512,2.6659,4.3456,0.1185,0.0293,5.4756,2.7242,1.7661,3.0281,0.0028,3.8074,0.5637,0.2003,0.0002,3.2311,3.0102,1.7041,2.4234,4.497,1.2524,3.2661,0.6361,5.2698,6.3648,1.3326,0.803,0.0001,3.2492,0.2611,4.7767,4.0577,1.6305,3.7801,7.0129,8.3224,3.7539,5.3105,6.128,1.4734,5.7731,4.2504,4.2032,5.2018,4.8099,2.2284,0.1263,0.0001,2.6282,4.6716,2.0873,6.1335,2.6359,7.3553,0.3888,1.5411,1.1877,2.1153,1.0671,7.082,6.5083,2.2166,2.3232,5.02,1.8224,2.335,2.1015,2.6857,2.0387,2.2794,0.8334,0.3966]}
{"id":3893,"ended":true,"length":522,"text":"The copper shark feeds more towards the bottom of the water column than the top, consuming cephalopods, including squid ( Loligo spp. ), < unk >, and octopus ; bony fishes ( Pectinatus bibroni ) ; a variety of molluscs including squid, octopus, and clams ; and fishes of various sizes including, e. g., the large deepwater squid ( Ptychocheilus gigas ). A number of fishes, both benthic and pelagic, have evolved specialized prey feeding strategies [ 6 ] that enable them to exploit a wider and richer spectrum of prey types. Some pelagic fishes, e. g., actinopterygii, hunt cephalopods from surface waters because cephalopods feed at the surface as well as the bottom; in other words, they act as \"predators of predators\". Pelagic fishes of the pelagic tunicates family use specialized adaptations, such as the cephalopod siphon apparatus and a large pre-oral sucker, < unk >, to facilitate an efficient feeding technique [ 5, 7 ]. Some pelagic fishes such as the pelagic tunicate and fusiform tunicate ( Goniodes ) also have specialized prey sorting equipment; however, this is not the predominant trait for most pelagic fishes. Most tropical pelagic fishes, e. g., are equipped with specialized suction devices to facilitate rapid pursuit of prey [ 8, 9 ]. Other pelagic fishes like pikefishes, e. g., use fast swimming to chase down and catch prey at the surface and use suction to suck up the prey.\n\nThe ability to distinguish food from non-food items is crucial for the survival and population persistence of any animal. While such discriminating abilities may first have developed as a function of competition to consume the most nourishing nutrients [ 1 ], there are also some organisms that do not require this ability, e. g., humans. Most animals use visual clues to identify food from non-food items. Some animals, e. g., use light, chemical or structural traits that are shared by similar compounds or structures as cues for distinguishing between food and non-food items [ 2, 3 ], e. g., the shape of fruit. Furthermore, many animals, e. g., use chemical cues produced by their prey such as organic acids and fatty acids, to distinguish between food and non-food items [ 4, 5 ] and chemical receptors and neurotransmitters, e. g., that affect locomotion to serve as cues for distinguishing between food and non- food items [ 6 ]. Because of the limited food available, differentiating between food and non-food items is probably also a survival strategy for fishes. However, there is a paucity of evidence that fishes discriminate between food and non-food items [ 7 ] and the ability to distinguish between different items of an otherwise uniform composition in a particular environment such as a river is also a survival necessity for fishes.","token_len":616,"entropy":[11.02,9.9478,7.7567,6.2765,8.8394,0.305,2.7553,0.8164,0.1091,2.3022,7.4983,1.5162,1.1279,4.2207,1.1415,8.1294,8.5653,2.2458,0.0015,0.1901,0.1053,2.3577,4.5019,4.4726,4.1038,13.7457,9.5316,3.097,0.1612,2.364,1.7205,12.9573,11.2744,5.5795,6.6703,3.2356,1.2902,5.0399,0.981,7.5682,6.6994,1.8909,2.3906,1.7917,4.9548,4.2859,2.6312,5.5034,4.646,7.5832,6.9306,0.7985,0.868,4.1498,5.2488,4.3798,0.0132,5.0368,0.1243,0.1645,0.8801,4.4335,4.5577,1.6454,1.9493,0.1512,0.2445,0.6714,5.4163,0.2565,2.6296,0.7731,5.1319,2.4583,2.5449,0.5771,3.1498,4.507,2.9945,0.2553,3.0072,0.2379,2.9813,3.6559,7.3018,3.2072,3.237,0.7821,3.5852,8.4629,2.8485,7.8758,4.382,5.7142,3.6881,2.2616,4.2145,2.8417,0.003,4.2533,2.2087,5.4614,5.854,3.5018,0.1026,0.1772,8.4114,0.0029,0.2278,2.421,3.943,4.8862,5.5025,3.8019,2.6375,5.4447,4.3766,2.7842,2.8651,4.6907,0.4727,0.026,4.6339,3.2718,5.2556,5.0275,4.7064,4.5639,0.0029,1.9199,3.5421,1.9159,4.3912,8.4659,0.0055,0.8716,1.6945,2.9191,0.005,0.0312,0.0249,7.97,3.0826,2.386,1.047,0.2704,2.3803,1.2397,7.5009,5.9078,0.0804,0.0014,0.0226,0.0859,4.0762,6.7404,0.4549,6.7045,4.3636,0.0155,0.0019,0.043,0.0872,2.8672,4.0243,2.6889,1.9923,4.6534,1.2496,0.3008,3.3572,2.4037,3.1486,3.897,2.1264,1.1975,0.0424,0.9124,6.0015,0.6918,4.3184,5.0124,0.1051,4.6386,4.3611,2.7088,6.2361,0.0127,0.7009,4.0613,1.0853,5.0327,0.0047,10.0744,3.7022,4.0755,6.7386,3.6343,5.2975,3.8287,0.8879,0.0058,2.5333,5.3031,0.0398,0.0061,0.1233,0.7228,6.9857,0.2929,5.8906,2.9441,3.584,3.7828,7.5169,1.5262,7.9242,7.2783,2.4198,9.6944,1.0157,0.0121,0.0544,0.561,1.0304,6.1575,5.2334,2.9876,1.3915,5.6768,1.383,3.0207,4.5313,1.7552,0.5035,4.342,1.9877,0.0127,0.6856,4.0842,0.0009,1.1983,4.7005,0.0783,3.2124,2.2429,4.1156,5.8997,1.7066,0.681,3.9099,0.9411,2.0726,9.8786,7.8368,4.0229,6.2403,1.868,2.8695,0.9524,1.0003,10.6381,6.2578,3.9999,3.0658,0.0803,3.1116,1.5989,1.3422,2.1693,4.0119,5.4939,2.774,3.0534,1.611,0.0073,0.2544,1.259,4.438,6.785,1.605,0.01,0.2706,1.8338,1.8488,0.001,0.0258,0.0156,2.4807,6.5721,0.0462,1.3752,7.9659,0.4139,3.6764,2.6321,3.5504,4.2192,9.7651,0.6606,0.7785,1.0758,0.8145,3.176,0.0902,0.3611,3.5083,1.673,0.003,0.1265,4.4442,5.4319,4.0579,4.0058,0.0803,1.228,3.3221,0.25,0.0329,0.0125,4.8762,7.163,5.5008,2.5223,5.3953,4.7055,3.1138,2.7137,0.8348,4.6086,2.1114,0.616,3.2826,4.4625,5.4169,0.0006,1.8461,4.9388,2.77,2.0263,1.6004,2.7655,3.3419,0.0005,2.2336,5.2472,0.8719,4.8015,4.9788,1.26,4.7894,0.3748,0.0626,4.9025,1.6518,3.1845,0.5591,1.8302,2.1307,2.7351,7.5761,7.4529,0.0145,5.7505,3.4774,1.3659,4.879,5.2676,8.1501,3.0642,2.0441,8.8369,3.7513,5.1357,2.7268,0.875,3.5808,0.0057,5.7421,5.7103,4.7403,3.1379,4.2302,6.5624,0.2488,5.6371,2.4876,1.4743,0.9726,3.3796,1.3136,1.956,3.3131,5.8286,0.5827,3.4891,0.2755,3.5274,2.2007,2.4962,2.477,2.4554,0.0005,0.0152,0.0571,6.3425,2.365,4.5708,3.913,4.0963,6.1182,5.8094,0.7322,2.2871,0.852,2.863,1.6517,0.0257,0.0684,1.3395,2.2568,4.2664,2.6161,1.9532,1.1989,0.0006,0.0183,0.0075,2.1688,6.3213,3.7108,5.745,3.3466,6.2576,7.7513,2.3592,2.2006,6.5538,1.3812,5.7141,9.3189,2.5614,3.9746,5.3754,5.4749,1.3249,4.6781,2.6836,0.926,0.7748,0.0935,0.0084,0.0014,0.5946,0.7751,1.2434,2.7697,0.1598,2.7863,1.8765,0.0005,0.0258,0.0373,2.638,5.8226,0.3135,5.9261,4.5404,5.4137,0.0028,2.6795,1.7697,2.355,0.3755,0.0006,0.0104,0.0058,0.8146,4.0122,1.5008,8.4738,0.2186,2.204,2.3339,3.8323,0.0048,8.206,2.6687,1.8469,4.7059,0.0577,1.7291,2.5622,1.3156,0.9494,1.0419,0.4997,0.0742,0.0034,0.0015,0.2008,0.6209,0.2028,1.8442,0.0627,3.1369,1.4513,7.4457,7.9705,3.8093,4.1129,0.2398,0.0002,3.0539,1.7532,0.0005,0.0146,0.0379,5.5928,4.7266,4.2444,0.284,5.5744,7.5045,0.6218,2.5676,0.3341,4.6375,0.5497,0.3533,0.2555,0.0582,0.0027,8.713,0.2184,0.2302,0.1651,0.4822,5.2452,1.8284,1.0663,3.5068,4.9305,2.5534,1.945,5.4416,2.7336,0.6791,0.6242,0.2739,0.0286,0.0016,0.0029,0.1017,1.3339,5.8735,5.0179,1.3665,5.3608,1.6647,1.5174,6.9091,1.7148,3.223,0.0028,3.0972,1.281,1.7392,8.6658,0.014,0.0001,0.0253,1.8231,1.2009,3.2931,4.5869,0.3154,0.7109,0.2522,0.0334,0.0018,0.0012,0.1199,0.9337,0.9729,2.7822,0.622,2.9891,3.2498,0.3031,1.1859,0.2995,4.6429,4.1396,4.4255,5.6339,5.0576,4.6375,4.2471,4.6212,2.6055,4.6771,2.5404,6.5155,0.0137,1.4405,3.9691,2.1047,3.9375,1.5654,2.0401,8.6661,0.5765,1.9687,1.1838]}
{"id":4190,"ended":true,"length":570,"text":"On February 21, 1995, Fossett landed in Leader, Saskatchewan, Canada, after taking off from South Korea, becoming the first person to make a solo flight across the Pacific Ocean in a manned aircraft. Fossett, a private citizen who had received his commercial pilot's license the previous month, had planned to fly a Cessna 172 on a round trip from Korea to Hawaii through the North Pacific Ocean. At the time, Fossett had logged about 1,000 total flight hours during his piloting career, and had begun flight instruction at Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He and three passengers, two of whom were also pilots, had arranged for Fossett to pilot two legs of the flight, which was to start on June 17, 1994. The last leg of the flight was to be a round trip home to Florida.\n\nFossett and his three passengers left South Korea on May 19, 1994, bound for Honolulu. On the first leg of the flight, Fossett flew the plane and completed the first round trip between both locations. Once Fossett landed, he told his three passengers that he wanted to try a nonstop flight to Hawaii, and began a solo first leg of the second flight. After finishing the first round trip, Fossett took off for a second leg, which he finished on the first day of flight, February 21.\n\nOn February 22, an aircraft carrying Fossett left Honolulu. The flight took the plane to South Korea, where Fossett's mother was waiting to pick up her son. Then, Fossett continued onwards for his first leg home to Florida, landing at South Florida Airport on February 28 at 2:30 p.m., completing the second leg of the flight.\n\nDuring the first leg of the flight between Korea and Hawaii, Fossett flew at an average of 500 nm per hour (about 930 km per hour), and completed a total flight time of 27 hours 52 minutes. Fossett and his passengers were expected to arrive in Hawaii on June 16, but the flight was cancelled after a crash in the Philippines.\n\nAfter the first leg to Hawaii, the plane was scheduled to fly to Okinawa, Japan, but Fossett was still trying to get a commercial aircraft to replace it. Fossett's attempts to get a plane to replace the 172 failed, and he would be forced to land the plane in Okinawa on May 24. On May 30, Fossett landed at Yokohama, and made his plans to fly to Florida.\n\nDuring the second leg of the flight, Fossett flew at an average speed of 250 nm per hour (about 500 km per hour), landing at Anchorage for refueling and rest on June 10. On June 11, he took off for the last leg of the flight, departing Anchorage at 2:55 a.m. with two more passengers. After circling the area a short time, he decided to return to Anchorage due to the weather and poor visibility.

The first section of the act of Congress, commonly called Marbury, held that while a State cannot enforce a judicial process out of the State, an act of Congress may have a different effect. This section was called the `` power of judicial review ''.\n\nIn effect, Congress, in 1803, placed this power of judicial review into one man, the Supreme and\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. This act also allowed for the assignment by the Supreme Court of the United States to the United States Court of Appeals jurisdiction to review matters to all those matters which they could not review in other courts of the country.\n\n3. The second section of the act of Congress, commonly called Marbury, provided that an act of the Federal government would be inapplicable where that act would have been inapplicable if it had been an act of a State. This section was called the `` supremacy clause ''.\n\nIn effect, this section held that where a Federal law, such as\n\nthe constitution and the constitution of the United States, were\n\nbeing violated as well as acts of Congress, an act of the Federal\n\ngovernment would take precedence over the acts of a State.\n\nThe court therefore held that when Congress was about to set aside\n\nacts of State law of the United States would not apply.\n\n4. The second and third sections of the act of Congress commonly called Marbury were also called the `` powers of judicial review ''.\n\nIn effect, the Supreme Court of the United States, had been given\n\nthe power of review over the Supreme Court of the United States, as well as the power of review over acts of other courts, and the powers of review over all other matters which could not be review in other courts.\n\nThis act contained the first written use of the term\n\nAmerican constitutionalist\n\nConstitutionalism in the English language is based on the\n\nSupreme Court of the United States as the guardian of the rule\n\nof law. The rule of law is based on the authority of the Judicial Branch of the\n\nGovernment.\n\nMarbury vs. Madison was the first\n\nU.S. Supreme Court case which considered an Article III\n\nJudiciary Clause violation.\n\nThe power of judicial review allowed for\n\nCongress to nullify\n\nthe decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States,\n\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District

{"id":3215,"ended":true,"length":575,"text":"Some critics were dissatisfied with the scope of the novel. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Times Book Review wrote that thematically, there was no reason that a Greek should be an intersex character. [28] As one character says of her father : \"His hair and eyes, the curve of his cheeks, the softness of his skin, his smoothness, the breadth of his shoulders \" (page 27), she had grown up unaware of what was wrong with him \u2014 the book has no details about his birth. [29] Others are disappointed with the novel because of its ambiguity, suggesting that by not revealing every detail of the novel's plot, he has put the reader in a similar position of uncertainty to that of the protagonist. [30]\n\nIn his review for The New York Times, Mordecai Richler criticized the book as \"too clever\" \u2014 \"too carefully crafted to let a good story out\", \"too much of a puzzle\" and \"too concerned with the psychology of women and children\". He claimed that if there were any justice in publishing, the novel would be \"sent to that mysterious pile where authors go when they can't or won't write good books, like David Copperfield\". He cited passages he felt the novel was too clever for: \"... the first time Lillias is attacked by fleas in her bed, she can't be seen\u2014 she must keep going because it's too cold out to lie down;... when she goes shopping and asks one of the shop assistants whether she has any red wool, she replies that of course they have;... when Lillias has to go to school and the bell rings, a maid brings the children into the hall so she can speak to the janitor of the school and have him take care of the situation;... when Lillias first meets her father, he doesn't even remember her \u2014 he thought he'd sent her home on the train;... when Lillias comes home late, her parents don't come down for dinner.\" [91] He also criticized the way that the novel showed the protagonist in a bad light. [6]\n\nIn his review in the same newspaper, Bernard DeVoto praised the novel, writing it was \"an absolutely brilliant piece of sustained literary writing\". However, he added that it was more like a mystery novel, \"which is an indication of its underlying concern. It doesn't tell you what it's like to be a woman in a pre-feminist world [instead giving] you a good story\".

{"id":4597,"ended":false,"length":508,"text":"Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their human needs, due to coercive or manipulative language that aims to induce fear, guilt, shame, etc. The aim of the Communication Mastery Series is to teach participants a set of practical and effective, yet non-coercive techniques for resolving interpersonal conflicts.\n\nWhat is Nonviolent Communication?\n\nIn Nonviolent Communication (NC), communication consists of the intent of the sender and not the message. In other words, NC is a process wherein people listen to one another. It is the process of creating a positive and mutually satisfying relationship.\n\nNonviolent Communication is not only a way to communicate effectively and increase harmony and peace but also a technique that helps improve the communication skills and interpersonal relationships in the workplace. With non-violent communication, teams can create a workplace culture of communication and cooperation that will increase productivity, reduce errors, and make the work place a more positive and harmonious place for all.\n\nIf NC can be taught, it will enhance our workplace relationships and allow us to create a workplace culture that is conducive to effective teamwork with less misunderstandings and miscommunication or conflicts.\n\nThe Communication Mastery Series will teach you the basic and advanced techniques, principles, and tools for resolving interpersonal conflicts effectively within your workplace. The program will teach you how to communicate differently with others. You will learn how to avoid blaming and shaming others. You will learn how to express your concern more effectively. In addition, you will learn how to help others solve conflicts and reduce conflict in your workplace. You will also learn how to manage conflict in your relationships.\n\nThis program teaches conflict-solving by using the tools developed by Marshall Rosenberg. The techniques and principles of NC will help you to:\n\n-Listen actively while respecting the needs of others\n\n-Find common ground when disagreeing\n\n-Refrain from shaming others\n\n-Communicate openly and honestly without blaming and shaming\n\n-Use non-violent language for resolving conflicts\n\n-Communicate in a way that reduces the need for conflict in any relationship\n\n-Help others resolve their conflicts\n\n-Encourage open-minded listening on behalf of others\n\nProgram Includes\n\n-Certificate of Attendance\n\n-Fully customized training material\n\n-Weekly email reminder for weekly assignments\n\n-Practice material for homework with each lesson\n\n-Certificate of completion will be sent to you via email\n\nWho Should Attend\n\n-Anyone who plans to use Conflict Resolution in a professional setting\n\n-Everyone who wants to learn new ways for communicating with others\n\n-Anyone who is looking to improve the communication skills within their workplaces\n\n-Anyone who

{"id":2350,"ended":true,"length":545,"text":"Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells. This can occur in three main ways. First, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment, in a process called transformation. Second, bacteria can transfer DNA between itself and another bacteria. This kind of bacterial \"trans-species\" transfer is called endosymbiosis. Third, bacteria can transfer DNA from one endosymbiont to another (an example of this is the transfer of the genes that make blue genes to the green bacteria).\n\nHow does this happen?\n\nThe DNA of different strains of bacteria is often very dissimilar. Some of it can be present in only two cells. For them to be able to cooperate on a large scale, each cell will incorporate certain parts. Once incorporated, the cells don't just turn into different species of bacteria, but become a kind of \"new species\" with their own DNA. This new species can have genetic material which has never before been seen in bacteria (for example genes in blue or green ). In turn, the other endosymbiont also incorporates parts of the \"host\" with unique DNA. As these new species come together, they have evolved to be able to exchange genetic material between themselves. Thus, they have evolved into what we know today as bacterial \"endosymbionts\".\n\nSometimes more than one species of bacteria enter into a symbiosis. When they do, the genetic material involved is usually very similar. In both endosymbionts and hybrids, the genes being exchanged are only of the same order. For example, bacterial flagella (which are part of the outer coat) are found in all green algae.\n\nWhat are the benefits and the drawbacks of these bacteria, and how do they survive?\n\nThere are some benefits too! For example many micro-organisms (such as jellyfish ) have developed endosymbiotic mechanisms for protection. When the temperature inside the cell gets too high, the endosymbiont will activate a form of DNA that enables it to protect itself. Another example is the use of symbiotic bacteria in the production of penicillin. In general, they can be very useful at protecting us from potentially dangerous bacteria.\n\nBut some bacteria can be very dangerous too. They often attack and kill other bacteria, or even human tissue (for example amoebas ). The main reason for their success is that they can transfer a large amount of DNA to an endosymbiont ( for example, those of amoebas can be transferred to around 50 times as much bacteria ). With such a huge genetic arsenal, they have no difficulty in outcompeting other bacteria. Bacteria which try to escape this fate also lose their DNA very easily. They are often able to \"eat\" the DNA of other bacteria by inserting their DNA into them as an endosymbiont. Those which are able to do this can pass on a large amount of genetic information and are able to evolve very quickly.","token_len":617,"entropy":[10.8398,5.544,7.383,6.1355,1.5711,2.9907,1.9583,1.6017,2.5422,2.4862,3.1353,1.5488,5.9516,3.967,0.3979,1.2459,1.3977,0.0667,1.7534,1.6273,3.9802,1.5886,8.2058,0.3939,1.7764,1.2733,2.5377,3.2009,1.3576,4.3503,2.588,1.6741,0.4656,7.5094,0.4288,2.1272,0.0048,0.6879,0.8128,3.1399,1.8171,1.8688,6.2759,0.1097,2.9406,3.1025,1.1417,2.7543,6.094,0.0055,5.4163,5.67,0.7409,6.4936,3.8441,1.1564,2.5856,1.3159,0.9871,6.4971,1.2412,0.4995,0.0011,0.0512,0.5274,0.8484,0.1165,0.6991,0.5079,1.8326,1.1703,1.9879,1.2747,4.175,4.4684,0.0171,0.0169,1.3853,0.0768,0.1837,0.2413,4.4727,5.2356,2.8037,0.701,0.9003,0.4771,1.3108,2.8541,0.133,3.3806,3.2901,3.337,1.5631,7.7967,7.2705,2.2869,3.9148,2.441,7.7743,0.6506,1.0016,0.0007,3.9278,1.8328,1.0351,0.7341,0.0965,1.826,0.0001,1.9918,4.7215,2.1715,5.4258,4.8421,0.1728,0.2606,1.5933,4.2435,4.5359,7.4444,0.0057,0.9542,3.0345,2.9892,5.8852,2.3831,0.5818,5.6492,0.3017,4.7503,3.4069,4.0754,1.9153,3.8843,9.1284,2.0174,1.9165,0.8617,0.0023,7.6361,3.5299,1.5608,5.25,1.6291,0.3714,4.4485,0.596,4.0926,11.1179,5.0635,3.8329,4.8269,4.7636,5.7617,0.4494,1.2548,2.155,6.2719,0.0008,4.3043,5.7518,1.9603,2.2522,3.2532,1.6556,0.3021,1.1256,0.9677,3.0253,3.3686,4.4978,0.002,2.0064,4.8016,1.9487,0.8458,3.7409,2.5234,0.2922,1.8606,0.4351,2.0741,2.5287,0.3944,1.7295,4.2334,3.9871,3.0336,4.9661,3.7662,3.907,3.0141,0.1108,2.1935,0.953,3.5265,3.3264,2.79,0.0962,6.841,3.0363,4.2572,3.0046,0.7412,8.6843,3.345,3.8946,0.0508,1.5372,5.4257,3.1873,0.0627,0.0054,0.0007,0.1042,0.1787,5.105,5.0532,4.1753,0.2723,1.036,5.8293,7.9828,0.8339,7.0607,4.9699,1.4058,0.9262,4.4063,3.5692,3.0997,1.5453,3.9447,1.3174,0.4303,1.1644,4.2677,4.8182,1.622,2.0666,3.6502,0.0064,4.7773,1.8477,0.053,2.0826,1.3386,1.9676,4.6604,0.2913,3.5277,2.4151,2.161,3.1693,5.1238,1.4937,2.3161,2.4632,0.0452,4.4551,1.6377,3.1529,0.0374,0.0268,0.0024,0.286,1.4944,1.39,0.3073,0.0002,6.5647,6.1529,1.085,0.1503,2.4703,0.7316,0.0988,5.7032,2.4099,0.7942,1.8117,1.4052,0.7962,3.7851,3.1969,0.875,0.5157,1.7557,4.2499,0.0372,6.0055,1.4682,3.7851,3.1007,1.9505,1.3135,2.4853,5.4482,7.0558,0.0232,0.0068,0.0118,0.2902,0.173,1.3329,9.4358,0.1191,1.1208,3.8671,6.6354,1.7629,0.9143,5.8569,5.4038,1.513,0.9479,3.938,0.938,2.3342,0.1457,0.0545,5.8506,8.3856,0.2052,0.9567,2.7594,3.3671,1.6843,4.0814,0.0218,0.6418,7.0266,5.1606,2.4851,2.0287,4.7471,0.4535,3.2908,6.2942,3.2608,1.6164,3.2253,0.0002,2.7112,2.2138,0.4683,3.8001,2.0738,4.2803,1.8422,0.4937,3.2147,3.3785,4.3493,0.4774,0.7422,0.857,0.436,7.0478,1.179,0.0329,0.0001,3.1316,0.1467,2.4924,1.2813,5.2031,5.0074,2.2907,0.4882,9.4495,5.333,4.4787,0.0185,3.2598,1.7686,0.0014,8.2782,0.0108,5.0369,2.5422,5.4752,7.2156,0.0687,0.0042,0.0046,1.5024,4.5468,3.5813,5.8048,1.9464,4.3889,2.4644,7.8196,3.6161,0.9883,1.2003,3.8951,0.3825,0.8425,0.3438,1.4698,3.2493,0.0257,0.0082,0.0062,0.548,0.5102,2.9233,7.5956,2.0854,6.6687,0.0114,3.9872,2.6035,5.751,0.9826,0.0204,5.0978,0.2281,1.0119,5.0053,2.7566,0.6039,1.4624,3.9888,0.0037,6.8991,0.2665,0.8014,2.3573,2.1561,3.1186,0.0408,9.0924,0.0416,0.0207,0.8682,2.8831,5.1714,0.1095,4.836,2.2891,1.7328,3.2619,2.1135,4.6636,2.8028,6.1154,0.2221,5.8268,2.3925,1.5613,0.7415,0.7915,0.0002,3.7231,3.5139,1.4221,2.2272,1.4935,1.9735,1.5914,4.6338,0.5133,3.2263,5.0211,3.4717,3.2211,0.6951,2.6328,0.948,1.8983,2.8383,2.1906,5.6111,4.6931,3.1912,1.7824,0.0664,8.0783,1.4169,0.0018,2.7942,2.3453,2.8249,4.4799,2.4613,0.86,4.1395,4.9204,0.41,0.6275,1.001,1.4827,4.7325,2.9569,1.7007,0.4635,0.0015,1.5017,2.2952,3.8687,2.363,0.0218,0.0065,0.0085,0.1693,0.0083,2.4376,7.6168,0.0841,1.3823,5.9854,2.2257,4.9782,0.0433,0.0044,0.343,3.5133,1.7402,1.1159,0.7685,9.0286,2.7696,4.7999,3.5113,1.0769,4.1825,3.9151,5.9184,3.6602,0.9366,3.2827,4.5525,6.2517,0.3771,2.5497,3.4475,3.4245,5.5672,1.4128,8.2098,1.9969,0.0236,1.6453,0.8251,0.818,7.8478,0.1051,4.7346,4.7072,0.0727,3.2772,4.2381,4.8045,3.2397,5.1739,1.0118,3.9536,6.8309,2.4068,0.4539,3.9645,2.2547,3.355,2.5128,0.0078,4.3865,5.4497,0.1079,1.4082,1.8098,1.4636,1.3242,0.4512,2.6651,4.4273,3.9037,2.9322,0.3627,2.701,4.6261,3.3984,2.126,0.1566,0.0167,0.0193,0.2285,0.0399,0.6769,7.1414,3.3714,2.279,1.0706,0.0122,2.5427,0.6129,2.3118,5.5793,1.6317,3.4264,2.0862,0.6832,0.0119,1.7366,2.8888,4.0407,3.3632,1.0752,0.0075,4.0816,4.4449,0.6605,0.6842]}
{"id":403,"ended":true,"length":524,"text":"Although Queen Charlotte pressed on all sail, she was not the first through the enemy line. That distinction belonged to a ship of the van squadron under Admiral Graves : HMS Defence under the superintendence of Captain E. I. Stannard ( NCC 1881, ref : GQC, ADM\/M), was also in the battle, and was the first through the enemy line, being followed by HMS Victory (NCC 1851, ref : GQC), HMS Neptune (NCC 1860, ref, GQC), HMS Repulse (NCC 1863, ref and RN 1863, ref : GQC) HMS Prince Rupert (NCC 1871, ref ) and HMS Monarch (NCC 1849, ref).\n\nFor a more detailed account on the battle, see the book : \" A history of the Second Battle of Ypres, 1918\" By Captain P. W. F. O'Curry.\n\n\"During the Battle the German ships were in complete confusion, both fleet and squadron being very heavily engaged. The ships of the van squadron had to sail by daylight with long sweeps to keep the British ships in their sight, and, as usual, the British weather fleet (HMS Aurora, HMS Revenge and L\u00e9on) which lay to the rear, managed to evade pursuit and escape.\"\n\nIn his \"Battleship Diplomacy: Britain at war, 1914-1919\" (2009), Prof. Robert B. Risdon of the US Naval Academy, gives the following description :\n\n\"Despite the confusion, the German flotilla was eventually forced to the south, between a British fleet screen and the retreating German merchant fleet. In the midst of the action, Admiral Graf Spee, flagship of the German fleet, had sent a signal requesting aid, which passed through the British communications ship HMS Tenedos. After the battle had passed, the destroyer HMS Tenedos proceeded south with the German signal of \u201cHURST BOTTOM\u2019s HOSTILE SHIPS\u201d. HMS Tenedos carried the message to the headquarters of the British fleet in the English Channel which then relayed it to Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, Commander in Chief of the British Fleet. However, Jellicoe declined to respond and instead instructed Admiral John French, Commander of the Allied French Fleet, to engage the German ships at their next position. After that incident Jellicoe made a request to the British Admiralty for permission to send a warship to aid the German cruiser which was seriously disabled and burning. This request was met with resistance, since Germany had refused to comply with the terms of the Armistice.

{"id":4934,"ended":true,"length":551,"text":"Salt is present in most foods, but in naturally occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it is present in very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods in the form of salt or salt substitutes. Although salt has a long history of use, modern estimates indicate that up to 70% of sodium intake is salt. It is therefore important to ensure that an adequate intake of salt is achieved to meet requirements.\n\nDietary needs for sodium are usually met by consuming a variety of foods, mainly from the five food groups. There are no Recommended Daily Allowances for sodium and no health implications related to an inadequate intake. On the other hand, an excess intake of sodium has been associated with hypertension, the risk of stroke and heart disease and kidney stones.\n\nFoods rich in sodium are often those foods processed in large amounts and are usually heavily salted. Most salted meat is heavily salted in the final preparation before packaging. High salt contents are also associated with processed foods in which salt has been added to food products. Salt is available in various forms such as table salt, natural salts obtained from sea water, sodium nitrate or dried and reconstituted salts and it is also commonly added to foods in the form of salt substitutes.\n\nSalt intake can be reduced by consuming a variety of foods and salt substitutes which have low salt content. Salt substitutes are usually free from added sodium or sodium chloride and can include monosodium glutamate (MSG ), potassium chloride, potassium mono- and disodium gluconate and sodium chloride. However, as with most foods, salt substitutes are not free from the potential to cause a food allergy.\n\nHow much salt is in your diet?\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend an average intake of 6 grams \/day (2.4 grams per kg of body weight ) to meet the recommended target of 2.2 g \/ day (1.7 g per kg of body weight ) for sodium. The Dietary Guidelines for Canada state that average sodium intake in Canada is around 4.5 grams \/day.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nDietary Needs for Sodium\n\nThere is no Recommended Daily Allowance for sodium and it is neither necessary to reduce consumption through dietary changes nor desirable to do so. There is an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of sodium for men and women of 1,600 mg \/day and 2,400 mg \/day. An ADI is the amount considered to be safe and an ADI is much lower than a Recommended Daily Allowance. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend an average daily intake of 6 grams of sodium for most adults. This is roughly equivalent to the salt content of 2.5 tablespoons or 1 teaspoon of table salt. The Dietary Guidelines for Canadians recommend a similar intake of sodium in adults, however, individuals over 50 years of age are advised to reduce their daily consumption to about 2.2g of sodium. The recommended RDA will vary depending on the age, sex and physical activity of the individual.","token_len":618,"entropy":[4.2716,6.8291,0.7152,3.1867,4.0213,1.2722,1.2027,3.3829,10.5227,0.9301,4.7779,5.115,0.0002,1.7339,0.0007,4.7839,0.5193,3.1368,1.1569,2.7208,0.6914,1.2452,0.9747,2.392,0.3016,5.0638,1.0495,1.7209,0.5036,2.87,0.5653,3.9964,3.4956,0.3284,4.289,0.6808,3.263,1.8529,0.2565,0.0015,4.5326,2.0496,4.6249,3.4844,0.6919,4.5907,3.0441,3.3012,2.5317,3.3869,0.3742,1.9987,2.3494,1.6251,5.7323,6.8574,2.1533,0.1569,4.7048,0.0012,3.4604,0.489,0.0757,3.7386,2.6065,1.195,3.993,3.0936,3.5316,0.3995,4.481,1.1089,0.2219,3.4925,0.3695,6.0673,1.5929,2.0795,0.2508,0.9098,0.2844,2.7223,3.6442,2.505,6.3961,2.9064,0.9555,0.0005,4.4708,0.2179,0.0612,6.2447,3.0369,1.4951,2.5232,4.1571,1.39,0.9851,4.1206,1.8206,1.5956,0.0016,0.84,1.3263,4.6397,3.9562,2.566,8.282,4.8617,0.0486,2.4424,3.9625,0.3601,3.585,9.716,2.5623,1.7807,0.1993,0.946,0.9851,3.3056,2.8251,6.7949,5.5257,4.9609,0.0045,5.8236,3.3794,0.1842,1.5859,6.3031,0.7023,0.2744,0.0026,0.0108,4.4705,2.9074,2.3069,0.4076,0.7587,4.38,0.4353,1.2344,0.0042,4.6013,0.6868,5.6343,2.2883,0.1384,2.3693,1.1425,3.1902,0.5019,2.0162,5.8384,3.0192,0.4294,1.4495,0.0002,4.8382,1.2321,5.3291,0.0073,0.6859,1.7258,2.6642,6.5725,5.2946,6.9389,1.7416,1.6087,2.4535,1.8057,2.3988,2.7292,7.4709,4.9833,0.001,1.0641,3.9338,3.3738,0.0124,6.5631,1.4235,7.3942,0.2671,0.0003,2.9593,1.7932,8.3766,3.5921,4.5413,5.5664,0.7217,5.5557,2.6793,7.531,1.3842,1.9925,3.2543,0.0043,7.3461,0.6897,3.4269,4.4622,2.6632,2.5854,0.3624,0.1582,1.3381,4.5465,3.4804,0.8658,3.8354,1.6139,5.8482,0.7952,3.9712,0.9649,3.3951,0.0067,6.9961,0.0183,0.3262,6.1053,3.5711,9.1772,0.242,4.5947,3.289,0.5936,3.8395,3.4353,0.4583,2.7922,6.7619,5.1557,8.2186,0.0189,0.0005,0.0006,2.9701,3.8524,6.5001,0.2668,2.2031,4.5803,1.3093,0.224,2.3752,3.1811,1.7209,0.4933,0.0011,2.4637,0.25,0.4152,0.8016,0.0002,2.8473,4.0437,2.9249,0.7005,2.7219,0.85,2.7068,1.5067,0.3921,0.0014,0.5059,2.6347,6.4115,0.359,4.5203,2.8765,4.5238,1.4652,0.0576,0.4711,2.7039,0.9157,1.5713,2.3367,6.2887,1.5625,2.8297,3.7466,2.7634,2.2461,2.2035,1.5867,2.6396,4.2156,7.2343,2.114,0.0075,1.0427,0.9701,0.6894,0.0064,8.3759,4.2732,0.645,1.1882,2.5446,6.9403,0.9974,2.3048,7.9941,0.0562,7.9073,0.037,0.0584,0.0052,3.0062,1.0637,2.1939,0.5493,4.008,0.0324,4.4272,1.7997,1.9022,1.6303,0.3748,1.9889,2.034,1.2444,1.3162,4.8966,0.362,3.8383,4.484,3.6884,1.3312,4.5912,3.6256,2.9498,0.6562,0.9564,0.0001,5.491,1.2801,0.6216,0.8897,1.3378,2.356,0.3809,0.5638,0.2514,0.0001,1.7558,3.4394,0.287,0.217,0.0081,3.8744,3.0928,1.0446,1.9651,0.0176,3.7456,2.2902,9.1685,2.7045,2.1091,3.1922,0.4305,2.3866,1.5849,1.3276,4.9101,1.8787,0.0268,0.2619,6.6683,4.691,1.5271,0.8323,1.921,6.6415,0.9474,2.4277,0.8571,2.805,1.6439,2.4158,1.3844,0.9692,1.2467,0.0884,2.433,1.3078,0.6672,0.085,0.509,0.048,0.0014,1.8495,1.2154,3.7549,1.0889,1.8678,2.7927,0.4238,0.6228,8.9812,5.4976,0.2292,5.4413,2.9561,0.2954,2.5977,1.4347,0.3103,4.4396,3.1527,0.9122,1.3991,1.2337,0.7784,0.9254,1.7522,1.0585,0.0002,6.2756,2.2989,0.3809,0.0276,0.3734,0.0001,6.1485,0.0047,0.0213,6.1996,1.0241,0.8819,0.4304,0.0001,4.2421,1.7676,0.9854,4.0466,0.0941,0.0014,2.7086,0.1559,0.0892,1.789,2.818,0.2483,8.5292,2.4032,3.9297,4.1575,4.9016,7.5059,3.0367,1.6495,0.4815,4.7966,1.348,3.0528,0.0263,0.9468,3.3372,0.9025,3.2007,8.4309,0.0604,1.1386,1.8086,1.1216,1.7613,0.0889,0.0727,1.3957,4.8101,1.5711,4.8806,0.7262,0.3362,3.0135,5.7667,2.6156,4.1548,0.3934,2.2347,0.4014,2.3768,2.6721,0.147,2.5757,0.0138,0.0705,0.0122,1.4846,4.5363,0.1657,0.0043,1.554,2.9892,1.4216,6.9522,1.7694,0.2311,3.0396,2.0572,5.8426,1.9508,0.0055,0.7895,7.9072,0.9034,0.4963,2.4822,5.2496,0.3056,0.0748,0.0016,1.47,2.3617,3.5198,0.2475,0.1939,0.697,1.8546,0.5989,0.2686,2.4232,0.1187,0.0098,1.1142,0.1165,4.8804,0.2116,1.6424,7.0631,2.1681,1.3018,2.8082,1.2397,5.708,1.9446,0.0216,2.0525,8.341,2.7173,0.1629,2.4806,1.5094,2.0171,5.2949,4.0042,1.2296,2.4105,0.2089,6.5075,0.0035,0.5526,2.091,1.8883,0.0456,0.051,3.0226,1.3536,2.7431,5.7007,2.6309,0.682,4.2326,3.6614,3.6231,2.6599,4.399,0.9152,6.8129,4.169,3.0445,0.5674,0.4553,0.0002,1.5754,1.3784,0.0621,3.1617,0.715,1.5587,4.3362,1.7375,3.1084,1.4695,0.9054,2.1002,4.8338,1.3299,0.1893,1.8849,2.3473,3.6529,8.8788,0.0532,6.2545,1.5587,1.4837,0.0545,0.4733,2.5336,2.6757,2.6655,0.7722,3.9014,0.1257,1.2696,0.2516,0.3937,0.5255]}
{"id":2252,"ended":true,"length":588,"text":"On the ABC versions, ten contestants competed in a preliminary `` Fastest Finger `` round for the right to play the main game on each episode. The contestants were presented with a question, and 60 seconds were allowed to answer it. Once they answered the round ended and the next contestant entered the game, usually while the clock was still running. The time limit, the number of contestants and the number of games did not change for each of the five seasons; the number of games on the American and international editions, however, did differ, from three to five.\n\nThe remaining three players played on and five new contestants were introduced. That process was repeated, only two more rounds were played and the final two had to play `` Fastest Finger `` to select the winner. Once again, as on the International Edition, there was a winner; in his words:\n\nYou should have seen me before the game. I was a little bit nervous but, once I was on the game, I was very confident in my ability to do what I was doing, and I felt I was the winner right there and then.\n\nThe winner was given $10,000 and first place on the leaderboard and toasted with champagne. At the end, four contestants remained:\n\nYou know I got to enjoy this, I went home tonight with $10,000 and I'm on top of the leaderboard. My confidence is really high at the moment, and I know I have a shot at winning the grand prize. I got a good chance, but I know there are other good contestants as well.\n\nYou're not really that kind-hearted, are you? (laughs). I've been watching these games from the beginning and I haven't expected to have this shot. I'm more than happy, but it's too soon to say if I'm the next host, I'll have to wait and see.\n\nThe winner would return to host the next episode with the help of his fellow competitors, for the first time it was possible to win more than just the first place in the leaderboard. This is an important moment in the game because it allowed the audience to vote for who they wanted to see host the show during the last show, where the final two would compete against each other in the same way they would in the last round.\n\nThe two men on either side were asked to reveal their answers at the same time and, if they got the question wrong, they answered an '' alternate question. '' This question had a time limit of 45 seconds and usually resulted in the incorrect answer or a tie. At that point, the contestants faced a race against the clock. In the United States the last two shows were hosted by Mario Lalli, while the last two shows aired in England were hosted by Jeremy Parrish.\n\nIn previous seasons, contestants answered an unlimited number of questions in every show. However, they were not allowed to get the question wrong in the last round because they could see the correct answer from the other contestants.","token_len":618,"entropy":[2.6156,9.072,13.211,1.3814,10.6338,7.6155,3.6917,0.6736,1.6045,6.4528,15.8606,16.3248,3.1352,7.6416,8.1992,3.4239,4.1037,1.0542,6.6205,0.1413,4.3243,1.8485,6.6108,2.0179,3.9261,4.6677,4.7392,0.488,1.7517,3.0315,1.6292,4.5766,0.3772,1.0326,6.315,2.3281,1.6371,10.2766,0.4954,3.2936,3.057,0.8329,3.7314,1.3165,0.5603,5.2883,2.3808,2.9746,1.1155,6.7128,8.3608,3.3465,0.7263,4.4904,1.5484,3.3636,0.7228,2.5809,1.0078,9.018,6.9865,2.0014,5.7891,0.3014,2.0842,2.3238,0.862,1.5368,5.624,1.6331,4.5665,3.862,1.8459,0.0181,2.5983,3.5743,0.4148,1.3172,0.0221,3.2905,6.3013,0.0267,1.5861,4.0503,1.7118,4.4887,0.1143,2.9312,2.1543,4.7033,1.576,3.3455,0.0564,1.1569,4.4938,1.3949,8.2272,4.3246,4.4422,4.31,3.9912,2.7609,0.0055,2.4763,7.4318,3.4315,2.4714,3.942,0.3814,1.938,0.9489,1.6247,0.0029,1.5894,6.8239,3.4502,5.7182,2.9549,2.8488,6.5781,8.9777,7.1355,1.337,1.5884,2.5278,1.4041,6.4361,5.7128,1.6631,1.0261,3.7574,5.394,2.9935,2.4337,4.0872,0.5287,0.354,2.1644,1.2372,2.1581,3.0169,4.5196,0.3119,3.1369,6.7548,1.7761,0.2442,0.1343,1.2654,3.1416,6.9412,1.0876,1.8263,0.288,5.3325,2.9908,0.1718,4.8184,5.1463,0.5561,7.1071,2.8159,0.3326,3.1028,0.8041,1.4861,5.2327,5.0916,3.5933,7.0633,5.1081,1.7591,2.1194,0.0004,4.7821,4.7028,2.4629,2.6451,3.1474,4.0044,1.6439,1.6357,2.123,1.2068,1.9589,2.5125,2.3728,2.9306,1.74,4.1448,4.0239,4.7607,1.2417,2.6115,3.4309,0.6225,3.6698,0.386,0.4963,1.8227,2.6888,3.1482,2.4977,0.5974,1.5028,0.9197,2.8631,2.0749,0.082,2.227,1.8741,3.1147,1.2186,0.8322,3.6512,2.198,1.4499,3.3864,3.3305,6.6751,2.0202,4.5435,2.7592,0.2153,1.0471,0.0002,1.6979,3.3993,1.5549,4.1192,3.8534,2.2155,0.2958,0.085,2.1695,6.6425,0.296,3.88,0.545,10.028,0.2455,2.9644,5.916,8.7191,2.8983,3.2471,0.7825,4.8716,0.487,0.7255,2.7497,5.1533,2.0329,6.1732,3.2648,3.1008,0.0001,5.4291,1.9251,3.3622,4.3249,2.3852,5.9567,1.8502,3.1719,2.0767,5.7143,2.4081,6.0598,2.6885,3.7382,0.3421,0.0781,0.0028,1.6194,1.8718,1.7487,4.9083,2.4035,0.7631,1.3863,4.8277,0.0524,1.0393,4.8756,5.4713,1.4075,3.1145,1.0272,4.6404,1.2047,0.721,1.6058,1.355,0.5439,3.6141,1.1303,2.9097,1.5867,3.397,0.9748,1.1134,2.046,5.1294,0.3609,0.5947,1.7185,4.6335,2.699,3.7507,3.8731,2.6412,1.99,0.6405,4.0835,3.2399,1.3034,2.5438,5.0938,5.3116,5.8374,0.0096,0.5137,0.9049,0.0002,4.4385,3.2284,2.6007,4.2376,3.7167,4.3801,9.7867,0.026,1.3213,2.1911,0.0138,0.102,5.4448,3.4358,4.3489,1.9414,3.2193,1.7722,4.6612,4.8536,1.9907,3.9779,1.3065,2.4584,1.8276,0.7461,4.7502,0.0007,6.4662,1.6501,4.4167,3.1334,6.5276,1.2107,1.1269,1.7993,5.5761,2.0433,0.8873,4.6924,1.5422,2.6208,0.557,4.3928,2.4262,0.3404,1.0529,2.7141,0.6531,1.3062,2.9285,4.3831,8.2373,2.6081,2.7581,3.0962,1.3935,0.0905,1.5788,1.6018,0.0201,0.3462,0.7485,0.0002,2.3549,2.1362,5.0864,5.4444,0.5753,3.7559,0.763,2.2421,3.1323,4.6132,1.9335,5.2867,0.0191,2.1354,3.9113,3.7838,1.6435,5.8229,1.5916,2.7798,0.0485,8.2375,0.8998,4.1047,0.7213,2.8553,4.8798,0.5007,3.6242,2.1576,3.1427,2.1859,4.0437,0.6985,5.7332,0.0971,0.273,4.0058,3.0311,3.5279,2.3064,3.4435,1.9981,0.6758,3.0048,3.136,1.2927,4.9083,1.3289,4.8816,0.2024,5.6488,1.2749,3.1375,2.1705,1.5121,0.2109,1.2425,3.5737,0.4187,2.885,5.7629,0.4602,4.7512,4.8418,1.9109,5.0905,1.5918,3.4001,2.3538,4.3003,3.6825,2.5068,0.3316,0.013,2.1308,1.0962,3.6351,5.1507,2.1906,1.6992,1.7546,0.7097,3.1814,5.1221,0.3702,0.7436,0.0002,1.7236,5.0295,5.5028,3.5493,5.4525,0.0837,2.4143,4.8241,0.5711,6.2856,0.5748,5.4503,4.5334,0.3948,4.658,0.0569,2.5229,3.823,3.4735,0.445,4.5708,1.2165,7.2466,3.028,0.1156,0.6895,8.0483,6.4199,5.3107,10.3399,3.9902,1.9754,3.2793,3.8487,6.32,3.4715,2.428,6.2524,0.3522,0.2921,4.9134,0.149,1.5024,7.0023,5.4452,0.0119,1.7868,7.4354,0.203,4.7597,2.0605,5.3426,0.6838,4.9965,2.3359,0.3314,0.3419,0.7456,2.5982,5.8886,3.8339,7.3959,1.9898,2.0204,0.0493,1.6174,3.4698,1.1867,5.6201,0.0338,3.0392,5.3905,1.6352,3.6295,1.3516,3.668,0.3769,8.8205,4.9872,6.438,1.3445,5.3436,1.2865,2.6465,0.7509,3.586,4.8336,1.7511,4.1688,2.9258,0.7887,0.0177,5.4518,6.8598,2.3298,0.5235,0.5997,0.0002,2.7041,6.6779,1.2656,0.4227,2.4321,6.6824,3.684,8.5992,0.095,0.0074,0.6847,2.3653,5.6544,2.7879,1.8325,3.2512,0.0481,4.7215,1.3363,2.4842,0.6184,0.0764,5.0329,2.5753,3.3729,0.2833,2.6849,1.1961,2.6363,2.5192,3.0704,1.3281,3.2399,6.42,1.4175,3.9243,0.2231,3.7594,0.7701,2.634,0.9141,0.7311]}
{"id":413,"ended":true,"length":566,"text":"Churches were primarily responsible for financing Civilian Public Service, providing for the men's food, clothes, and other material needs. The churches also provided and paid for the camp director.\n\nCamp sites were organized by departments of commerce production agriculture, and health. The first year the camp sites were about 4 miles (6.5 km) in length by one mile (.5 kilometers) in width. A large part of these camps did not meet the specifications for camps and were not used during 1940.\n\nIn 1940, there, were 5 camps set up for men of different trades. There were also five camp sites set up for all men who were not in a trade camp. There were 14 camps overall. These 14 sites were separated by sex and age group because men of one age group might have jobs to do near each other but would be at different campsites at a later date. Most women were housed away from the men in the first year of the program in order for the men's camp director and cook to have more intimate conversations with the men.\n\nIn 1941 all campsites were standardized to one mile (1.6 km) by one or two miles (2.5 km and 3.2 km ) long and divided the camps into male and female quarters.\n\nWartime jobs were open to married men and women in the Service as long as they would not receive more than $9 a week for the jobs. Wartime jobs could not be done by married men who served on the home front.\n\nCamps for married males were located in urban areas with the maximum number of men to be at one camp being no more than 40% of the total camp.\n\nCamps for married males were located in areas where the men would be close together.\n\nThere were also camps for single men and women.\n\nIn 1941 the pay scales were based on the average daily pay of each camp.\n\nThe camps organized the work in the camps according to the trades for the men. The camps grouped the men into trades according to the physical characteristics of the men. A table shows the trades in 1941.\n\nIn 1941, there were 9 camp sites for all women and 3 camp sites for married men.

{"id":3705,"ended":true,"length":544,"text":"Metabolism involves a vast array of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This is one of the fundamentals of enzymology.\n\nThe basic three types of reactions, commonly referred to as the first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics, illustrate the processes involved in metabolism. First law of thermodynamics relates entropy, a fundamental measure of disorder, with energy.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics relates energy to the amount of work done.\n\nThe third law of thermodynamics relates the mass of an object to its energy.\n\nAll three laws were discovered through mathematical theory. One of the first laws of thermodynamics was discovered in the late 19th century by the British mathematician Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nSince then, other theoretical and statistical mechanics laws related to the first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics have also provided deep insights into many biological processes.\n\nMetabolism in Biochemistry\n\nThere are a large number of enzymes in any given organism that facilitate the breakdown of complex macromolecule molecules into simpler, or smaller, molecules of simpler forms.\n\nIn some cases, enzymes act as the catalyst for a chemical reaction to take place. For instance, in the conversion of glucose to glycogen in the brain, glucose serves as the main substrate and is transferred to specific proteins, which in turn transfer their glucose to specialized phospholipases, which hydrolyze the glycosidic bond, i.e., transfer their glucose to other hydrophilic groups on the hydrolyzable proteins (like acid) in order to transfer the enzyme glucose transporters from the active site of the enzymes to the cell membrane in order to distribute this glucose to the various cells of the body.\n\nThese specific enzymes are specialized to their target protein substrates.\n\nMetabolism and Its Effects on the Body\n\nThe major function of metabolism is to support the basic needs of life.\n\nThis means that a healthy body is one that is capable of performing these basic biological functions even if the body no longer has access to the oxygen and energy sources needed to carry out the specific function.\n\nThe human body provides for its own basic needs by constantly converting energy from one form to another within the body. If oxygen and energy levels are low, the cell can adapt at various level, i.e., by switching to anaerobicity [1], or energy harvesting and storing [2, 3]. For instance, glycogen will be converted to glucose and stored in the liver, thus helping to provide energy to support these functions. In the presence of low levels of oxygen and energy, the cells produce enzymes to break apart molecules or carry out other metabolic work, such as burning fats stored in tissues and the liver, converting sugars to sugar alcohols like maltose or gluconic acid, and using the chemical energy in the form of hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions to perform other work.","token_len":619,"entropy":[10.4011,0.1588,8.4245,2.1665,7.007,1.4917,0.0027,2.5186,1.0736,1.4881,3.4664,3.4858,9.5021,1.6181,2.8778,3.5323,1.9372,4.1744,0.9238,3.9443,2.8503,3.4548,1.9119,5.5075,0.0517,7.3074,3.0532,1.3336,3.5328,2.313,4.1015,5.4446,4.9976,2.2069,0.4011,3.3026,1.5077,3.4571,0.2432,0.0736,7.7717,0.1404,7.3412,0.0002,5.111,0.9204,0.9233,0.0007,2.2373,3.5293,5.7982,1.4368,0.0466,1.5032,3.628,7.2666,1.0068,0.0074,0.0403,2.6075,5.5592,2.8772,0.5501,0.7972,0.0676,0.0849,7.896,0.9444,1.0131,0.0398,0.2063,8.0533,0.9397,5.2831,1.6281,0.3195,3.5793,0.6189,2.9327,4.8367,1.1957,0.0273,0.0228,5.5219,7.6096,2.1092,3.5817,3.2169,2.6738,0.0942,9.1085,1.8743,5.1492,4.3147,1.3658,3.7193,0.0001,1.8272,0.4332,0.1608,0.2607,0.0108,0.0029,1.1781,1.9453,1.1,2.6793,3.0394,0.0512,5.4556,3.0092,1.4702,2.3357,0.0001,0.2897,0.0822,0.0405,0.0349,0.0001,0.0017,0.1952,1.9089,4.7976,0.1834,2.9824,0.5968,1.3052,0.6821,2.7862,0.6416,0.1898,0.0002,4.0672,0.4362,0.8784,5.3747,4.0439,3.8735,5.4789,5.4953,1.4692,4.6948,0.5996,0.2956,2.5099,0.5647,1.2304,0.0314,0.0037,1.5537,3.0523,1.1752,1.5489,2.5113,1.7324,0.0015,0.0507,0.9317,2.923,3.3564,1.1117,2.5581,1.6381,0.0138,0.5583,1.8043,0.0002,5.3546,0.7216,0.2158,4.1483,6.5933,2.1967,4.5209,5.9079,8.5154,6.0494,0.0835,1.6562,5.0592,1.7711,0.0124,0.1172,0.0409,0.0089,0.0801,0.6932,0.0192,0.0025,0.112,2.871,8.1709,9.5976,0.9259,0.0771,4.8396,4.72,0.5799,0.5041,0.7881,0.0002,5.7156,0.0946,0.0237,3.6913,4.4133,0.2116,0.3659,0.0001,4.4428,0.2806,2.723,4.3381,0.1471,0.003,3.8753,1.6114,5.8576,4.0679,1.0133,1.7964,7.2102,0.8326,3.1291,0.0806,4.1663,9.0608,0.1005,0.0025,6.0815,1.8757,2.4169,5.0379,1.6557,4.406,4.5696,0.7503,0.784,5.8934,7.1965,5.683,0.2369,1.14,0.0002,2.9182,3.6866,1.4432,0.1942,2.2882,4.3311,0.9518,3.6731,4.3589,0.34,2.9178,2.4938,0.0917,3.2208,3.9754,0.1716,0.543,2.1271,2.9831,0.0215,2.3692,1.6305,6.7512,0.1019,3.2693,1.0428,3.8929,0.955,2.3635,1.4059,4.3551,0.4029,3.2105,6.915,0.2523,1.0348,4.2232,2.7814,2.9414,3.4702,5.1237,0.6357,5.9707,3.3978,2.7551,2.0925,1.7738,0.0041,3.9183,2.8096,3.5974,0.7129,7.3185,5.4903,1.0258,0.0002,3.6264,1.8803,0.8278,8.6421,0.0447,0.0364,1.0555,4.2222,2.4813,5.6311,0.1866,5.141,3.2301,6.7383,0.002,0.0014,0.1906,4.2321,2.9588,0.8342,0.2887,3.3085,6.266,0.4826,0.4599,4.4548,4.2424,0.2249,6.1536,0.6388,6.6609,1.005,6.6608,3.3498,4.1544,8.3364,3.6914,2.0996,3.2147,0.0808,3.9553,1.1705,5.5379,5.1088,10.0106,0.1827,0.0038,3.6342,1.2063,5.702,4.3576,2.0457,0.4293,5.8276,0.2948,0.3774,4.1708,1.9,4.6851,0.4893,0.0726,6.8728,4.2962,0.3011,0.915,0.9505,4.8462,3.1581,2.7887,0.12,1.8878,0.3089,0.2902,0.0001,4.0749,5.6386,2.976,1.4028,6.0291,2.0891,4.9161,4.2301,3.6695,7.0746,0.0064,1.4984,2.4609,0.0001,3.0685,0.0638,0.1083,3.6809,5.2328,4.3502,0.4362,2.0768,2.7343,0.1516,0.0001,2.0621,5.0719,5.1261,0.0865,2.9862,0.4557,0.4381,5.0844,0.7578,5.741,4.494,0.2203,5.0763,0.9983,1.9435,0.0001,4.0046,2.5227,0.316,3.3439,4.7464,0.8581,2.0395,3.2679,0.6894,1.6713,2.4924,0.0155,4.8315,3.4306,1.3397,4.9678,0.0857,6.6811,1.6054,1.629,1.3332,8.1728,0.0004,1.4846,2.9669,0.0075,1.7894,4.6947,1.5001,5.1736,4.3786,2.4544,0.5194,4.0779,0.4986,1.6885,4.5693,4.2374,1.3301,0.3363,0.0001,2.2611,4.4177,0.1398,4.6186,2.7263,4.0303,0.7856,2.9786,0.3627,3.0447,5.9291,5.1461,2.9159,1.2465,2.1185,3.4085,1.0641,0.0209,4.7894,0.8165,0.3127,0.5856,4.5557,5.642,1.2864,1.9052,3.979,0.8948,1.7472,0.4418,1.2276,6.1819,2.5528,6.4664,6.2942,6.4407,7.6773,2.4987,5.2778,0.0006,0.0007,0.1297,3.1274,4.7793,1.3261,2.6341,1.8612,4.48,11.5547,7.1943,3.3912,2.1372,1.6858,5.7469,4.6039,4.4222,3.9948,1.4191,0.0635,2.9679,0.3907,0.2926,4.7999,1.387,0.0065,7.5248,0.0219,5.4143,1.0843,1.4532,0.4291,1.2918,2.3578,1.5886,0.9808,0.7321,1.2724,1.8811,4.2646,4.1589,0.9275,3.5098,1.6722,1.4864,5.9668,5.2842,1.9228,0.4807,3.5151,2.206,4.5945,0.0028,2.8113,0.6029,0.0057,1.0018,0.6866,1.6518,0.3379,1.0258,2.0899,4.6973,3.646,2.179,3.6465,6.3918,4.279,4.7056,6.9394,0.4573,3.328,2.2016,4.9335,1.8549,1.2542,0.0016,7.313,2.7,7.8104,0.2266,4.2089,2.2686,3.3915,4.5499,2.1904,5.4871,5.0919,1.29,5.2232,5.9996,0.126,6.6904,5.1027,1.7284,2.0582,8.0124,0.1836,0.0347,2.792,0.1428,1.7471,1.1764,4.199,2.2827,5.7525,2.78,3.6333,0.9152,2.2853,0.0169,3.7999,3.5826,3.3267,5.8184,0.3321,0.5373,2.5866,0.6422,4.8352,2.3825,4.8493,0.7643]}
{"id":553,"ended":true,"length":522,"text":"The study of proteins in vivo is often concerned with the synthesis and localization of the protein within the cell. Although many intracellular proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and membrane @ - @, the vast majority are synthesized intracellularly@2,3@. The synthesis and localization of intracellular proteins is a subject that receives frequent study in cell biology.\n\nA variety of techniques have been developed to study these protein @- @. For example, methods for the mass spectrometry analysis of proteins@7-, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of proteins@7 and the mass spectrometry and fluorescent labeling of proteins@3@7. However, none of these methods directly address the question of whether or not intracellular and cytoplasmic proteins are correctly translated.\n\nThe localization of cytosolic and intracellular protein into the nucleus is thought to occur during protein translation. This occurs in two stages: 1) an initial translocation and 2) subsequent transcription or recruitment of a RNA polymerase and recruitment of ribosomal subunits into the translocated protein complex @ 5-8. Although these stages represent two stages in the process, some protein complexes may be able to translocate into the nucleus immediately after RNA translation has taken place. For example, several ribosome-interacting proteins (RIPs) appear to directly translocate into the nuclear pore at or prior to the initiation of mRNA translation@2. To better understand this process and to obtain information on translocation timing and site selection, many of the techniques that would be useful for studying cytosolic and intracellular proteins (like NMRs and mass spectrometry) must be combined with a method to measure the translocation of the proteins into the nucleus.\n\nA number of studies have been done to understand this process. The first is the analysis of protein localization during translation in the presence of histone deacetylase, which is an essential component of the e3 protein complex and which prevents protein translation from continuing after it begins@2. The second is the use of antibodies that recognize RNA and histones and that block protein formation@6-8. Lastly, the detection of protein translocation into the nucleus during nuclear import is the most direct method which would allow the detection of translocation and time as well as localization. Nuclear import of membrane-bound proteins has been studied in a number of ways, and a variety of methods have been developed to investigate nuclear import of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, including NMRs and mass spectrometry. However, these methods are not suitable for studying translocation because they cannot directly measure translocation timing or the localization of nuclear proteins in the nucleus.\n\nUsing a variety of techniques for nuclear imports, we are investigating how proteins with two forms of translocation can translocate into the nucleus, which will provide a better understanding of how the e3-Au complex can transport membrane-bound and cytoplasmic proteins into the nucleus.","token_len":619,"entropy":[7.7925,3.5108,8.4687,1.7522,4.725,2.6343,4.9234,5.6049,0.0621,1.0511,5.5194,1.7462,4.1655,0.0101,3.2777,3.0794,6.2822,1.0024,1.5242,1.0631,4.1079,3.4565,8.3736,0.0133,0.0058,0.5906,0.845,3.4047,0.0536,1.2806,0.838,4.7735,0.026,0.0014,0.0004,2.7139,4.7781,14.807,5.9071,6.737,3.8343,2.0857,4.9149,0.0111,1.1707,3.7515,0.0307,7.0428,0.0017,0.1791,0.0084,12.0683,6.0651,2.3219,2.6454,7.7467,4.3262,1.9117,3.3712,2.1011,0.3628,0.0615,2.862,0.0014,0.0016,0.4819,1.4994,2.7813,5.3135,4.002,6.7162,5.0368,4.6452,2.2238,3.7977,0.6061,1.0212,3.2426,0.0019,3.3976,4.7552,0.0036,5.6781,1.1481,0.0516,1.3569,0.2751,3.1332,4.014,3.8851,9.6519,2.4103,0.5259,2.4449,3.516,0.2804,0.0546,6.5415,2.7236,2.4117,7.0288,1.1488,0.0455,0.0734,3.4358,0.2104,1.8263,9.4752,6.446,7.4573,5.4293,5.5167,2.0638,0.0288,3.3344,0.0989,0.0009,0.1483,3.0445,0.5442,0.9899,0.2774,2.2883,4.9122,1.9582,4.3151,0.0453,0.012,0.1077,4.6134,6.0844,2.9772,0.3667,0.7292,0.0674,3.5868,4.0367,7.4569,3.0244,3.4387,0.0247,4.1248,0.1812,0.0994,0.8725,6.1198,3.6034,0.3468,3.6682,0.1788,1.5582,2.0564,0.0116,2.9788,0.0021,0.0003,6.0988,3.6469,0.0187,0.0088,0.0014,0.0955,0.4285,0.7631,7.58,4.4892,2.9144,1.7304,0.0002,1.871,6.8886,0.4197,6.6564,0.1021,0.8934,1.8504,2.0373,0.0031,0.0029,2.3027,7.1116,0.6562,3.6856,1.7602,5.3881,0.0442,2.7454,3.8607,4.894,3.2443,1.5548,2.3536,3.909,2.0423,3.301,3.2693,0.9802,3.27,0.15,5.1082,2.4017,3.0862,0.6037,3.6616,0.3823,0.0055,3.5525,4.8702,4.8211,7.4451,0.6154,2.3937,9.1876,2.4844,0.1318,4.5731,10.0445,0.1079,7.1657,0.192,0.7058,6.4117,0.2428,2.6714,0.2857,8.311,2.4219,1.6756,6.0408,6.5529,6.8562,1.868,2.5694,1.1885,4.3009,3.4491,3.9122,6.5818,3.5004,3.3994,1.2646,0.7843,2.0983,0.9837,4.8198,4.2998,2.6102,3.3151,1.2138,3.8755,0.0029,4.6525,0.0062,1.4471,0.5692,0.1816,6.802,0.8316,4.9468,4.2621,3.885,2.5747,0.0017,0.5592,3.1662,0.1423,0.0084,4.6946,4.2504,0.017,3.7028,1.984,7.2048,0.7635,1.0527,2.2477,7.4039,1.1878,0.2295,6.185,0.5128,6.7311,2.584,0.0029,0.501,0.2103,6.138,5.3846,1.6385,3.7404,6.0836,5.9311,0.0062,1.8091,3.0489,0.0351,3.6025,0.5778,7.8905,2.5773,0.7658,4.793,5.25,0.3041,1.8781,0.6907,3.192,1.1044,5.0067,2.4831,0.8706,3.9749,0.1043,6.824,2.1747,5.8739,4.8256,0.3651,5.7086,2.5592,0.2112,4.9973,2.9671,7.5484,0.7993,2.4337,1.5096,3.0505,5.1227,0.0048,0.1065,0.9517,0.4791,0.0066,0.0005,0.6868,4.6733,4.4798,3.6891,0.0583,3.5602,1.7292,4.9829,0.0239,0.0077,0.0573,0.3358,4.7373,0.4187,3.5837,1.2031,3.0754,4.5084,1.796,3.4346,0.962,2.9609,0.0637,0.7511,2.3859,1.4943,1.8948,0.1249,0.2484,0.6465,0.668,0.0002,2.8538,2.5702,0.0014,2.7126,0.3001,1.602,2.6104,0.653,3.1386,3.7032,0.4152,0.9187,2.2618,1.5266,1.7299,0.823,5.0577,0.0242,2.573,2.8131,4.1168,2.6626,3.2306,1.559,4.2131,0.096,7.0492,0.6401,0.9198,0.0572,0.0005,0.3438,2.2718,1.6261,0.8385,2.6468,4.7705,3.4859,0.1649,1.174,8.6148,7.9588,4.2955,4.09,3.8528,3.3028,6.4208,2.8441,2.5059,2.5217,6.8904,2.6755,3.419,6.6291,8.5178,1.5179,0.1838,1.612,0.5718,0.431,0.2483,4.5727,0.0022,5.5522,2.7173,4.2479,6.1211,2.4316,5.2443,2.383,1.8464,3.0432,5.6946,2.1925,6.1395,2.9545,3.8914,3.6212,0.4377,0.442,5.6867,0.0284,1.4872,4.6849,0.1724,2.358,3.703,0.1348,3.8598,0.2889,0.3664,3.5442,5.971,7.3371,2.7426,3.1419,2.0549,4.4694,1.6668,6.7023,3.3792,1.5969,1.9543,2.1821,0.0995,3.6351,0.0889,3.7859,6.9837,6.6559,0.6056,0.0105,2.8355,1.9116,9.8556,0.5201,2.6033,7.133,1.4123,0.5914,0.7735,2.7931,0.4497,3.4612,1.5728,2.5553,0.4534,0.001,3.7482,1.4189,2.8744,3.7281,3.5352,0.0085,1.7775,0.696,0.0523,0.5829,0.5135,3.6,4.9285,0.2458,1.3884,4.5901,0.0181,0.0118,0.0006,0.0326,2.8224,3.5589,2.6384,3.1778,1.359,3.3779,0.06,1.2095,1.2745,0.8607,0.0081,0.0037,0.0266,0.5607,3.0218,0.0064,3.2143,0.5384,1.1461,1.212,4.0721,0.1243,2.6719,4.4126,0.0404,4.7073,1.1476,3.1015,3.555,1.7956,2.3647,0.0163,1.592,1.8337,3.7219,1.7534,0.2136,4.6669,0.2905,2.3842,0.6874,0.5946,0.378,0.509,0.0002,6.2607,1.9895,3.2457,0.0007,2.389,3.4007,4.4699,5.3726,1.043,2.7147,3.6766,7.6625,2.9441,1.8989,4.7319,5.0249,5.6393,1.2948,3.5234,0.0264,1.8566,5.1623,0.0028,0.4197,0.1564,0.0684,2.4438,2.618,4.439,2.8548,2.3405,1.5139,0.1791,0.0372,2.3173,2.0489,7.2798,0.0604,3.0023,5.1703,6.718,5.5879,3.422,5.3171,5.4121,0.5952,0.0064,3.6021,1.9064,0.0039,0.0078,0.0014,0.0053,0.1846,0.8559,0.0987,0.1084,0.4091]}
{"id":372,"ended":true,"length":522,"text":"The current chapel was probably built to replace the one destroyed by an earthquake in 1170. Only the east end of the original chapel, which housed the apse, and a small part of the west end are surviving. The south doorway of the apse was preserved and the walls are still largely unaltered. However, two towers, probably belonging to the original structures, survive only through the present chapel roof.\n\nThere are no inscriptions. The original altar and a stone with the royal name \"Praestantius, son of Constantius \" are preserved in the sacristy of the castle of Mollat.\n\nThe present sanctuary was started in 1410. Until 1445 it had only Gothic elements, probably only built as a chapel because the king wanted to have a church as soon as possible. The first major work has probably begun with the building of the present choir with the apses of the nave and of the apse in 1442.\n\nIt is not known when or under whom the apse was built. The apse walls are also still unalterated. On the apse wall is an inscription, probably placed by the present convent, that names \"Francesca\", wife of Bishop Francesco di Giovanni. There is also a painting of \"Agnolo di Francesco \".\n\nIn 1455 the facade was rebuilt with a new portico and new windows. At the same time another chapel was added on the south side. Between 1460 and 1465 the north transept was built, only partly finished. On 6th November 1454 was dedicated to St. Boniface (bishop between 778 and 785 ) the first church of the new settlement.\n\nThe present choir and the south porch were built in 1535. On 15 August 1560 was consecrated a sacristy to the left of the altar, which was in the old chapel.\n\nIn 1588, under the reign of Emperor Charles of Habsburg, the cloister was built, which is still in use.\n\nThe present presbytery is dated 1575 and was built at the same time. The walls which now conceal the narthex are most likely part of the original 1450 chapel.\n\nOn 17 August 1593 was inaugurated the first nave, which was connected to the side chapels by four portals. In 1598 appeared at the west end a chapel that could connect to the nave by an antechamber and an entrance gate. This may have been built in a previous era since the entrance gate and the narthex were destroyed some time before 1622 or even earlier. The chapel which the narthex connects to is still preserved.\n\nThe main altar of the present church was made in 1619. The first two altars were probably destroyed when the sacristy was built in 1555. The present altar is rich and consists of several different pieces. On the altar are two old sculptures and a few pieces of Baroque work.","token_len":619,"entropy":[6.5575,13.4026,2.5788,6.9367,1.2656,3.1775,4.7464,0.6457,2.0828,6.1132,1.1592,3.9575,1.0378,1.086,6.5062,4.5871,0.8098,6.4034,1.8561,6.7511,3.7795,0.548,0.2637,5.2054,0.9826,2.8605,1.3521,4.224,0.844,10.1762,2.2717,1.7929,4.0825,2.7084,2.5993,3.5726,0.0315,0.2028,4.1864,1.1193,2.8589,6.2582,0.4044,1.62,4.9124,8.1598,2.0261,0.1114,4.3543,0.0007,1.6197,5.4923,2.3897,1.9011,5.2183,1.949,2.0291,7.6163,6.7492,2.0731,0.0048,0.445,4.6812,0.1032,5.6208,6.6259,2.3855,5.6378,4.8261,0.0031,0.6959,4.8039,8.6149,0.3233,7.4333,7.0249,4.5249,1.2391,5.6864,6.2372,6.4113,0.5312,1.3713,0.0255,4.2561,0.9305,2.5126,6.4232,0.0023,4.4771,1.4849,3.6124,4.734,3.074,3.4799,4.8214,6.6232,1.6958,7.8847,2.9327,3.1449,3.8567,3.9454,4.2266,7.3469,3.3292,5.0192,4.2997,0.0452,7.319,0.0747,5.8113,0.9223,3.4012,1.0251,0.452,7.8353,0.0622,0.0421,1.418,0.7661,7.6163,1.8035,5.0861,5.2399,5.5156,4.6593,1.8683,0.0002,1.3994,6.6653,5.7155,1.7762,7.1862,1.2214,2.9009,4.4984,1.7841,7.3672,3.5192,4.3322,2.1784,2.4474,3.4299,10.8926,4.817,1.3458,4.8608,6.1627,6.9622,3.827,0.7561,2.7271,5.1327,1.7391,5.0129,3.6079,0.7226,3.9872,0.9765,3.8713,4.9387,5.5077,0.0053,0.1306,0.3852,1.3915,4.4278,6.0281,5.2053,6.092,5.4828,4.5522,2.9771,0.9994,2.7051,0.047,1.0422,5.9191,5.7182,4.9205,1.0857,7.3838,5.9941,6.1751,1.0617,0.934,7.143,1.2452,1.3515,4.1003,0.1464,6.1383,0.0132,3.2047,1.8205,4.1079,0.5243,1.7229,0.0002,3.7799,0.9296,2.6743,0.9142,3.2706,3.0342,5.1833,3.9282,0.653,5.0385,0.0077,0.4322,0.3139,0.6151,1.4124,3.2338,0.0059,6.7237,1.2593,4.7924,4.2685,4.3452,9.5222,4.2863,0.8173,5.2767,0.6692,5.8031,0.0097,2.1889,1.4414,2.7814,0.7252,2.3878,2.8764,5.9879,1.6501,1.1099,8.3295,7.6257,1.5863,2.2817,7.4886,3.477,7.0304,1.8716,2.7907,2.6828,8.8121,0.0411,6.3344,4.6825,1.5424,5.3021,5.2653,1.7307,3.9117,0.5402,0.9834,0.5783,5.4981,0.9284,4.1797,3.6249,4.5844,5.6977,2.2885,2.6377,0.3261,6.9746,1.0383,0.0002,2.9092,1.325,3.6377,1.2698,9.6004,1.6928,3.1896,2.5459,1.4603,2.3809,8.8222,0.3637,1.7756,3.8795,3.0608,0.749,4.6523,0.8036,2.3237,0.0154,5.5913,2.6423,0.6096,2.6533,3.9834,0.4784,2.1383,1.1708,1.8172,6.5584,0.6727,2.7937,0.0552,0.3031,1.698,1.0551,5.8554,8.7386,0.1705,0.0793,0.668,3.496,2.1579,6.4132,4.8751,3.5227,1.2092,3.6611,5.6396,2.6382,2.7281,0.4956,5.0595,6.4109,4.1768,3.2464,2.9443,0.5762,6.3204,0.3606,0.0119,3.4828,5.9739,10.384,5.553,7.1485,0.137,1.1748,2.3799,7.4599,1.7041,3.4323,3.2417,1.674,1.0044,4.2525,7.6582,1.1787,1.3541,0.0002,1.201,4.7298,3.9054,3.3843,1.4555,7.2181,5.6797,1.3686,1.1199,1.0075,2.451,3.7304,1.0284,3.2599,2.9771,6.5653,0.4209,4.8337,3.9584,1.8708,0.083,2.7621,6.0131,0.218,0.0519,3.1758,1.2071,7.9247,0.7215,0.1834,2.0353,1.7365,2.1426,1.1518,3.8595,1.4574,5.4613,0.9292,1.14,1.9858,0.0002,2.1943,0.8682,4.8567,2.6766,5.9079,0.4174,4.8388,0.0601,3.8383,4.2679,4.2286,7.7963,2.1359,0.0002,0.4208,0.7372,7.4313,0.4444,0.6636,2.3226,2.9502,3.3265,2.0972,1.7149,1.7156,0.7234,0.8817,1.6665,0.0002,1.3119,3.903,9.5988,1.1893,0.0507,1.8319,3.7891,2.1203,4.1341,1.972,2.4519,1.6833,2.886,0.9822,2.5867,0.2417,2.9085,1.5311,4.4302,6.1706,3.8229,8.3617,0.1831,6.2725,11.1814,0.9661,1.7993,6.2694,1.2154,6.4726,0.0127,0.4771,2.2279,7.682,1.9252,1.8392,0.6941,0.95,0.0002,3.463,3.6635,3.0321,0.8833,3.8172,5.5385,4.0067,0.0004,0.5415,2.9484,7.3507,2.3807,2.0869,1.6897,1.0755,5.4093,1.0634,0.1246,6.7551,9.9009,0.0333,1.7375,5.3788,6.4742,0.9324,3.1469,1.8796,2.1455,10.0149,5.2942,0.6679,4.5377,1.0553,2.4756,1.938,3.3477,4.4551,7.0972,0.9967,0.2729,2.1551,0.0966,3.2568,2.6281,5.0352,2.2891,0.008,2.5547,3.37,3.8551,2.9448,0.5823,3.3208,5.7742,0.5402,0.265,2.8907,1.8393,3.3094,3.7578,3.3192,6.4322,0.9174,3.9791,1.1281,3.841,0.9655,2.3823,5.1388,0.0015,1.0593,4.1387,7.1066,2.2198,1.1251,4.798,4.6009,4.7151,4.1695,3.8373,0.2499,1.7771,2.3556,4.8376,4.191,2.4667,1.6728,0.0016,5.7966,0.3503,1.3933,1.7452,3.984,1.2555,0.5127,0.0002,1.2101,4.6397,3.0526,2.3603,0.2845,2.9829,2.2746,1.2462,4.6024,1.1664,2.0627,4.0266,1.0378,1.3909,3.4256,4.1284,5.7095,0.0044,0.9644,4.0556,5.5113,3.3935,0.8794,7.9574,0.1151,0.0632,0.5996,2.7521,1.6036,2.8555,4.1656,0.413,1.2373,5.3333,0.9323,1.5271,9.3657,4.2239,5.2392,0.2345,3.9652,4.8878,3.4214,1.5525,3.3194,0.6215,3.0796,2.0369,2.2742,6.5136,7.2043,2.5145,1.2456,3.7956,3.3105,0.372,11.2188,1.0105,0.0325,5.5762,0.6515]}
{"id":4486,"ended":true,"length":595,"text":"In November 2010, Fox announced that Fringe was being moved to Friday nights as a part of the network's midseason overhaul, to air after the fourth season of their reality series Kitchen Nightmares.[6] The move was originally intended to air after the season three ender, \"The Second Coming\", but filming of the episode was delayed.[7] Fringe, along with the other Friday night sitcom New Girl, was originally scheduled to air every week at 8:00pm ET on Friday.[6] However, due to scheduling difficulties, the network ended up moving New Girl into its regular time slot on Sunday, along with moving Friday Night Lights to Friday nights and moving Fringe to Wednesdays at 9:00pm ET.[6][8]\n\nFringe was intended to follow a week after the season four premiere of its parent series The X-Files, but a scheduling conflict with The X-Files meant that Fringe aired the season four debut on February 1, 2011.[8] Fox had ordered a 13-episode fifth season that was planned to begin airing on May 3, 2011.[8] On May 19, 2011, Fox announced that the series has been renewed for a sixth season that will consist of 13 episodes and air on Fridays, starting in February 2012.[9]\n\nIn September 2011, the show went into production in Los Angeles, California.[10] On October 12, 2011, Fox announced that they have ordered the 13-episode third season of Fringe and that it will premiere on January 16, 2012.[5] On April 14, 2011, Fox announced that the series has been renewed for a fourth season that consists of 13 episodes and air in the Fall of 2012.[11] On September 17, 2012, the show was renewed for a fifth season.\n\nOn October 31, 2013, Fox officially renewed Fringe for a sixth season to premiere on January 22, 2014. On February 27, 2014, ABC officially picked up the show for a seventh season, with the season premiere date for the 2014\u201315 season still to come.[13]\n\nFor the first 5 seasons, Fox aired an exclusive version of the pilot episode of each new season. In October 2007, however, Fox showed an exclusive clip of the show's premiere episode during the 2008 NFL season which would become the new standard for the series. The pilot was subsequently edited into two pieces. The first piece was played exclusively on March 28 and the second piece, consisting of the whole pilot episode, was shown exclusively on November 28.[17] Since the beginning, Fox has alternated seasons which have exclusive first episodes and seasons which do not.

{"id":2410,"ended":true,"length":607,"text":"He thought that the manner of eye movement affected the sight. He suggested `` shifting ``, or moving the eyes back and forth to get an illusion of objects `` swinging `` in different directions [Kahn, 1984, p. 38]. Also, he had an experience of the world `` swinging ``, while he `` was `` asleep. His explanation for this was that `` as you sleep your eyes move slowly backward & forward, sometimes side to side `` ---a way of saying that the eyes are `` shifting ` `, and that these are illusions [Kahn, 1984, p. 39]. He called it `` sleep ` ` -induced _eye motion'` - ` - motion'`. To explain this, he suggested that `` there may be certain mental processes which induce movements as though they were not voluntary ` `'; one such suggestion was that certain mental processes `` may produce _physical symptoms'` - ` _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ --an interesting suggestion, but one rejected by our researchers. Finally, he proposed that the mind could be an object that could move with the eyes. As part of a proposal for his final thesis, he proposed to show that `` you can move a body by moving its eyes. `` He made a device that included a `` string that was attached to the back of the head. As an arm would `` sway ` `, the eyes `` would `` move along with `` it. `` To test this, he asked one of his subjects to move his eyes, but also move his arm. The motion of the arm was observed by him and the subjects could not see each other move the eyes. He said that `` this makes it clear that the body ` s eyes can move, just like arms do ` `. '' His explanation for this was that `` the mind does not move to the left or right, but it moves in the same direction as the arm. `` He stated that the mind `` does not move from left to right, but goes in the same direction as the brain ` s left and right hemisphere. He also stated that `` people do not move their legs when they sleep ` `, so this shows that the mind does not move during sleep either ` `. '' He was surprised that any of his proposed explanations would actually affect anyone '' s life, since `` if you move your legs it does not make your legs move ` ` ''. He was, however, very pleased when an undergraduate student who had done some of his labwork came to him, after hearing his explanations, and said `` I learned how to control _my_ eyes ` `. \" He had been able to control the eye twitches which had been so troublesome to him.\n\nFinally, we will end this paragraph with a point he made in a television interview :\n\nI also found that a lot of the behavior which people call `` normal ` ` is really some kind of behavior that can be _taught. _ The mind and body are not so different, they are just different kinds of things.","token_len":620,"entropy":[7.0322,2.4739,2.4432,8.911,1.1143,9.9296,3.2149,6.2062,1.4523,5.9214,1.7683,1.6792,5.9653,12.0966,14.337,6.9377,5.5356,3.3229,3.0435,2.1626,2.1645,4.29,0.5215,0.0094,2.7783,3.6442,3.3886,5.5664,0.5058,7.6521,4.3267,12.6855,4.2835,2.929,4.6592,0.0828,7.8523,6.4943,5.2715,1.8553,4.9545,1.1625,0.4396,0.0598,5.2723,0.7878,6.5758,0.5887,2.0487,4.2621,3.8434,3.5517,1.4494,3.0786,5.5928,4.5948,5.5929,2.1757,2.2162,5.3006,2.9268,5.8904,2.2665,3.6183,5.0503,2.2549,4.5269,5.48,2.1045,0.8744,1.646,0.7377,3.0396,5.0668,3.9775,6.3024,4.1122,0.9101,2.3361,4.6255,5.4052,8.2424,0.9437,1.7247,4.8325,6.9582,1.862,0.0002,6.3365,9.833,5.5125,4.528,0.9943,3.1567,0.8904,1.6168,2.7558,1.1512,5.1628,3.4516,3.674,3.9438,5.5365,1.9362,2.1884,4.5621,3.4497,7.2952,5.7463,0.7295,0.0034,0.0404,0.1105,0.0286,0.166,0.0005,1.1539,0.1408,2.798,5.5736,1.9068,0.6592,5.8991,4.1428,1.1733,5.591,7.3767,7.8651,8.3245,3.989,4.1103,7.455,4.8612,3.3835,5.5928,5.9727,8.3686,6.977,4.9184,3.6081,0.9577,1.1274,0.8686,2.2724,0.8375,2.5531,4.0495,3.4726,0.1662,5.7945,5.1922,2.0071,1.9247,4.2371,5.8037,5.4082,4.4109,1.1438,0.3627,4.4435,7.2049,4.4685,0.2231,11.7565,4.7683,1.9768,7.5353,0.9819,1.1052,5.8795,2.6561,0.2893,3.7539,2.3499,4.5723,7.8981,6.7418,5.4382,3.3764,3.5696,3.166,0.8612,5.9338,5.8164,2.5386,1.8773,1.4618,1.1729,0.9535,0.7746,0.6392,0.5306,0.4467,0.379,0.3259,0.2804,0.2462,6.86,6.6678,6.046,3.8806,2.0787,1.5234,1.7546,8.4595,0.168,5.9433,5.5323,0.9624,5.3859,0.0531,1.1851,2.4853,0.7144,1.9121,3.6752,3.5907,1.1239,5.5842,3.0534,3.9008,3.1666,2.5992,3.37,1.8188,1.8829,1.976,4.0877,6.2192,0.0019,2.8841,7.8235,2.5947,4.3966,5.8533,5.1695,0.443,1.0966,1.8261,1.9205,4.0722,0.5979,2.6179,4.9686,1.6635,2.001,2.8204,4.0874,2.3338,1.8576,3.3915,1.7273,1.9524,2.9522,1.8612,4.8803,1.7534,6.6155,1.843,6.0105,0.9797,2.8251,7.5794,3.9526,2.1978,1.9779,0.1781,1.0571,3.4004,0.173,0.5116,2.1267,2.1136,4.3452,3.765,6.1375,3.519,4.7223,7.7311,2.6155,0.0634,1.679,1.1465,6.9952,3.9935,1.7963,2.5217,1.3757,3.8992,2.311,2.8585,4.575,1.0725,2.1172,4.3719,3.5772,0.7111,1.4493,0.5325,4.2274,3.9418,0.498,0.5931,3.1595,0.6487,1.529,1.5101,2.0033,3.4613,3.5726,4.6075,3.6883,0.8176,2.97,1.041,1.8923,6.9579,1.1536,0.3798,1.1329,1.3512,4.6188,1.792,4.1913,2.7211,2.0735,3.1511,5.5917,2.3353,2.2792,3.2535,0.012,9.8821,1.6943,1.9926,0.7932,1.8539,3.3648,0.7338,1.8182,2.867,4.9301,1.5495,3.839,0.292,1.279,4.0214,3.3328,6.2566,1.8925,2.989,0.5951,3.2067,6.0051,1.2465,5.9359,2.511,3.5063,0.0213,2.3541,4.9912,4.4392,4.4452,1.1367,0.4908,0.8463,0.2125,0.4424,1.852,3.3231,4.4848,0.3786,1.7015,4.6796,2.832,2.7211,0.9239,0.2935,1.677,1.1507,2.8527,1.2657,3.2839,1.4751,1.7835,0.4149,1.076,0.7676,2.2075,1.4424,2.0081,1.6055,5.4349,0.2197,2.2142,2.1924,3.6213,3.2021,0.3394,0.7858,4.1539,1.8104,0.2862,0.0069,0.9819,0.624,5.7295,3.2484,0.4501,0.4824,0.0576,0.1842,0.2175,5.1968,0.9487,1.9668,5.3257,1.421,0.0455,4.5511,1.476,1.9008,2.2359,3.0572,0.0993,1.7498,5.1464,3.0282,0.2757,1.8141,1.8631,4.3726,2.7554,0.7185,3.4133,2.6515,0.0139,1.2997,3.384,4.231,5.594,0.3681,0.9567,0.6808,1.4,0.1872,0.3742,5.3693,0.4831,5.9378,2.981,0.0518,1.3032,3.5846,1.4924,3.0497,5.2423,1.4568,5.5031,0.7965,0.9612,6.3,4.4425,3.3616,4.6354,5.8541,5.6251,7.932,5.5759,3.697,2.1457,3.3984,2.9268,4.1175,1.7731,3.7311,0.274,0.876,3.1314,2.7289,0.3344,2.9276,3.1953,3.5114,0.6284,2.678,0.0348,6.2094,7.5921,2.1013,2.4802,5.1006,0.4908,0.0031,3.1736,2.4894,2.665,5.1404,5.2421,0.5997,3.3882,1.0421,4.604,2.1501,2.17,0.5739,6.4927,2.3321,5.634,0.9579,1.0009,3.0575,5.4737,3.8391,1.4448,3.7787,0.4692,0.5219,1.8679,1.5752,1.8736,5.796,3.9079,1.1181,5.5854,8.0074,5.4983,1.6602,2.4903,2.8543,0.1377,1.3938,3.9442,1.557,3.5345,2.5737,5.4435,0.0295,2.3993,2.1685,2.4447,8.862,1.6066,4.8231,3.1301,1.3809,4.7523,4.6176,1.6948,0.6652,1.9472,4.4012,0.0281,5.8607,0.039,2.9364,4.0651,6.3838,1.8975,5.6044,0.6994,0.7808,5.6269,5.543,0.6369,1.6485,1.972,7.871,0.6892,6.1507,3.7488,0.0002,2.7253,5.6155,3.2031,1.3942,3.8478,2.6693,0.0318,1.9691,5.7189,4.2353,3.8362,5.5942,0.844,6.8385,3.1131,0.8871,1.6469,3.8987,5.9548,0.9535,0.0022,3.5876,1.7445,3.4125,0.5913,7.2057,5.5019,2.4555,3.3185,5.8585,4.2805,5.2363,4.706,1.5165,1.626,2.1644,4.7437,0.8522,2.2538,3.5954,0.7756,1.7196,1.1476,4.0093,0.0398,1.4001,0.4781]}
{"id":1063,"ended":true,"length":553,"text":"Bell was considered in February 1999 to be the front @ - @ runner in the mayoral race. Other potential candidates included State's Attorney Patricia Jessamy, former City Councilman Carl Stokes, and Cleveland school commissioner Eric Gordon. The first round of primaries was set for March 2, 1999.\n\nBell, a former state legislator, is an outspoken advocate for social, political, and economic issues of interest to the black community. Bell believes @ - @ racial equality begins with economic empowerment @ - @ and says his record proves it. He said the economic base is critical to attracting the kind of jobs that will give young black men an opportunity to rise out of poverty and turn their circumstances around. Bell's message has carried him through several local campaigns that have had strong opposition from the city's corporate and financial institutions.\n\nAmong Bell's campaign promises is closing the juvenile justice center at Shaker Square. He is also a supporter of eliminating the \"stop and frisk\" policy in police departments across the city and increasing opportunities in schools for young people of all ethnic backgrounds. Bell is active in the Cleveland Public League and is Vice President of the City Club of Cleveland.\n\nBell had been considering a possible run for mayor for several months. In January he announced the formation of Progress Cleveland, which is supposed to be \"an independent, multi-issue organization that speaks for hard-working citizens of Cleveland.\" He also created a political action committee to raise money to support Progress Cleveland.\n\nThe Bell for Cleveland campaign was largely funded by Bell's parents, who contributed $45,000 of the $65,000 raised during the race. Also contributing significant amounts of money were John H. Sisson, the chairman of The Hays Companies, which donated $8,500; and the Cleveland branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAAACP), which gave $6,200.\n\nBell himself reported raising $33,746, including donations of $3,000 from his brother James Bell, who had been mayor of Cleveland from 1974 to 1983. His campaign received a further $15,000 in contributions, most of them from union leaders in the city. In addition, the Cleveland branch of the NAAACP gave his campaign $10,000.\n\nBell lost the election by approximately 9,000 votes to mayor C.T. Vancil. This defeat followed a string of campaigns in which Bell lost to Vancil. He had also been rejected by voters in the November 1994 election after running for Ohio governor as a Democrat in a hotly contested primary with union leader Ed FitzGerald. In that race, Bell lost to FitzGerald by approximately 12,000 votes.\n\nThe May 1999 primary was the first time that the top two vote-getters in a primary ran head to head in a general election. This was a novel procedure instituted by former Mayor Edward K. Burke. Bell and Vancil had defeated opponents in the February primary and March general election and had subsequently qualified for the general election ballot.","token_len":620,"entropy":[4.8095,6.0741,5.2704,5.6746,5.9416,1.1484,0.3723,1.381,5.8381,15.3111,7.0378,4.6945,6.5774,2.6439,0.4752,9.8556,0.2531,0.9983,7.3576,4.5213,0.3646,2.2578,7.3144,3.6447,0.4859,6.6015,9.0608,5.2839,0.8194,2.5843,3.2753,0.8899,0.6697,5.8709,4.6097,2.4663,0.5408,1.3647,8.0804,6.628,7.1246,5.9535,6.3223,0.2552,2.9945,4.9071,3.4432,0.5748,3.8117,1.8218,6.4758,0.3519,2.6855,3.2647,0.7775,1.1563,0.6021,1.7043,0.0079,7.7984,3.2381,2.0044,1.6103,3.3016,2.5328,0.7793,2.9396,3.7544,3.0793,2.3006,0.3148,4.5937,4.0358,4.356,1.3535,0.253,0.8522,2.3568,4.1511,3.4884,0.0675,1.0112,5.6586,0.0995,0.486,2.6922,5.4742,11.9409,1.7581,0.2162,6.8322,2.2909,7.9279,0.8833,4.5965,4.2103,8.476,0.3054,0.355,2.5222,6.5593,4.8737,6.5436,5.579,2.7168,0.8851,1.3056,3.0709,3.1684,5.3628,6.7695,2.3382,4.817,0.6013,6.8388,2.847,5.3562,0.0023,5.6551,1.5014,2.8028,4.2349,4.2731,0.8994,1.1903,3.0956,0.7549,0.2341,5.4954,4.7829,0.027,0.0652,1.7211,6.2589,0.7968,10.6865,2.6019,0.2689,2.6052,2.8382,4.3311,3.2232,6.8298,2.6003,1.8043,3.2111,4.1839,3.1304,4.824,0.7258,4.4389,3.532,7.4787,1.1326,1.6331,2.7805,1.1547,7.611,1.3637,3.2251,5.062,0.3094,0.9166,0.0003,6.4277,2.3168,0.0174,3.0788,1.7283,0.9783,7.912,0.7971,6.7121,1.9322,4.5798,1.19,7.3665,2.0362,4.6736,1.8772,2.0164,2.971,0.9819,3.5762,2.4196,0.0338,6.3775,0.795,3.4799,5.6395,1.3255,0.0175,0.0049,0.1901,1.2904,1.8211,4.9753,1.1238,1.712,0.167,2.0686,2.3415,4.8826,6.7216,4.0476,3.6161,2.9226,2.0545,1.893,3.1812,3.7086,3.986,1.2956,0.2303,1.4917,2.3145,7.0822,0.3055,1.2983,4.1179,4.5564,7.8819,1.406,2.0955,8.7976,0.3156,0.3791,1.0911,4.0116,5.6392,0.2918,0.426,0.4067,0.7948,0.0002,1.122,5.1702,2.0455,6.2632,1.3732,5.9824,0.6434,0.184,0.679,2.2395,1.7929,1.5051,1.2861,2.494,2.8806,3.3311,1.6933,3.6316,3.4223,0.0236,7.5757,1.5722,0.7417,2.2164,1.7645,7.8276,0.0013,2.1693,3.0883,3.2342,1.6399,1.555,5.4246,0.0185,3.641,2.4556,1.4093,6.5473,1.5183,7.844,1.0597,0.0899,2.3985,1.3979,0.5181,1.1288,2.1523,2.3011,5.6669,1.2459,4.6063,0.4385,0.0121,1.093,2.9956,0.2356,1.8908,2.2192,6.9989,0.4802,0.785,0.7727,0.0002,3.111,7.6329,8.7987,3.2625,0.8671,2.4421,5.4216,1.2667,0.3365,4.4828,0.9218,3.974,0.9938,2.1541,5.5324,0.9059,5.0445,0.0204,0.1024,4.9465,2.4417,0.6652,5.0214,0.0068,0.0666,2.1374,3.4948,0.3614,4.3843,0.3412,6.0108,2.9065,5.8583,0.8764,2.2451,0.4965,0.7315,5.8065,5.625,1.113,6.0884,6.0034,0.6629,2.7506,4.1971,0.2144,5.4822,5.6508,3.0095,8.764,0.5671,2.9264,4.5947,0.1657,4.3774,0.0862,1.5386,2.9365,1.9544,4.2198,2.6322,6.65,0.0295,1.6709,3.4363,1.8717,1.5206,0.4767,0.0655,0.0001,0.0033,0.0013,0.002,0.002,1.8477,2.0244,1.7958,3.7636,0.7814,0.3704,1.9495,0.1031,3.0687,0.0029,4.0624,0.2545,0.8299,0.0002,1.0226,6.3439,6.5557,4.347,0.7511,5.1198,0.015,5.838,3.2655,3.5111,2.7978,5.6097,1.8034,0.3914,3.4087,0.0102,1.5612,1.5498,1.8788,3.7461,4.2273,2.3147,1.0135,1.5062,3.7835,2.7602,4.2776,0.6311,0.5617,1.4684,4.4028,0.3824,3.228,0.3446,3.7077,3.2373,4.3121,2.9506,6.6116,0.0286,3.4898,0.0024,0.7524,2.7068,1.0277,3.7181,4.0905,0.3267,1.9033,0.4565,8.44,2.4387,3.6239,1.3431,1.0586,0.6198,3.7888,0.7762,0.395,2.1015,3.701,2.5375,0.1233,0.5661,1.2979,0.0831,0.0597,1.255,6.597,1.1923,0.4623,2.5845,0.0014,0.234,1.2102,0.389,0.0002,1.135,7.0631,1.7225,2.4292,2.8125,5.9515,3.7006,0.6244,0.4882,0.0209,1.4322,6.1431,5.6638,1.14,3.5978,0.0171,7.6747,7.6193,2.8198,1.264,5.2776,3.6585,5.4818,1.1279,4.2153,0.0013,7.73,1.9155,0.2863,0.4997,3.8214,2.1077,2.9484,0.0349,0.011,1.775,2.4935,3.3655,2.9764,2.3968,7.4173,0.6078,4.1367,0.8233,1.8978,4.3992,5.1058,1.6189,4.1396,5.2783,2.966,5.9009,2.0595,3.9676,0.598,1.0014,3.5318,2.2147,5.1137,0.0285,1.4023,4.9266,7.0366,3.5806,5.533,4.6728,1.5228,0.0104,0.2232,2.75,3.659,1.5337,0.4253,0.2468,1.4247,1.5855,1.7641,0.0123,0.0014,0.7095,5.0957,4.0941,0.0781,0.2836,0.0516,0.5275,0.7414,0.0002,3.2082,6.5799,3.2942,2.2368,1.8357,2.1243,1.1603,1.8975,2.054,2.6671,6.5845,1.3178,6.0793,0.5713,0.0334,0.0437,1.0524,1.281,1.518,6.6304,4.5732,2.0556,0.0152,1.6189,1.4596,1.7687,0.0137,0.3951,4.2415,1.4083,2.2273,8.5126,8.1478,6.9159,0.6698,4.6281,1.984,4.9495,4.1974,0.4514,7.0071,2.1443,5.1066,3.508,2.6345,0.0064,0.0011,1.8039,5.2329,5.7012,1.3128,0.9,5.4282,2.8238,2.327,5.0607,2.9753,0.4596,3.3493,1.8776,7.1051,6.536,0.3844,0.3779,1.4111,0.1169,5.7269,0.5774]}
{"id":2254,"ended":true,"length":585,"text":"Contestants are given a series of lifelines to aid them with difficult questions. They can use as many lifelines as desired per question, but each lifeline can only be used once per game. The final round is a \"Head to Head\" format, where teams play against each other. A correct answer earns them 1 point, and incorrect answers incur a time out ( the lifeline can be \"Revive \"ed to allow for an attempt at the question ). A point is lost on the next question for each incorrect answer. A team can win the match with a score of 300 points, or if they score all of their questions correctly.\n\nThe \"Question of the Week\" is a question which has a special difficulty rating. A special difficulty multiplier may also be awarded. Any questions which have a normal difficulty rating will have an extra difficulty multiplier applied - if a question has a \"1x\" multiplier, a \"2x\" multiplier will apply to the question mark in the final tally, if a question has a \"3x\" multiplier, there will be a \"4x\" multiplier also given. The team that scores the most points in these matches win, or tie for first place if there is a tie for first. In the final round, tie-breaking rules are employed :\n\nIf both teams obtain the same score, points will be awarded to the team who had the less number of incorrect answers. If both teams have the same number of correct answers, points will be awarded based on the time they spent on the set, with the earlier game taking precedence. If both teams had equal times, points will be determined by the bonus points given during the \"Question of the Week\".\n\nThere are eight games per match ; each game is worth 2 points, and the team with the most points at the end of the first game wins the match.\n\nIn the case that neither team is undefeated after the first eight games, a golden tie-breaker is used, with the scores from all of the previous games to be used to compare teams.\n\nFor a team to be eligible for the playoffs, there must be at least six teams in the league in the same week which are undefeated, three of which are at the top of the standings. Teams placed lower than sixth will not qualify. Teams played in an earlier season and not making the playoffs must forfeit their win (if it came later in the season they must forfeit their loss ).\n\nThe four teams that lose the first round will advance to the consolation bracket after the first round.\n\nThe winner of the consolation bracket will then continue on to compete in the finals.\n\nIf there is a tie for first place, the same tie-breaking rules as in the final round will apply. The winner will then proceed directly to the finals.\n\nIn the final round, the \"Question of the Week\" is worth 10 points, along with normal difficulty multipliers. All remaining multipliers will be halved in the final round. The team that reaches 300 points first wins.","token_len":620,"entropy":[6.5816,3.8363,2.7638,4.5158,1.5965,5.2427,0.0076,10.0547,2.3819,2.2592,6.3132,0.7473,3.4734,7.2287,4.8239,1.1989,2.7533,1.4867,3.9657,6.8872,0.5912,2.5742,0.0938,0.0858,6.0481,7.3257,4.6806,1.2106,1.6373,3.7749,1.6268,0.0257,2.1567,1.2108,0.9669,0.4853,0.5322,0.7376,5.3894,0.6318,2.4342,4.7733,7.0491,2.1931,2.5424,4.672,8.7208,2.5473,0.3447,0.2396,4.3394,1.3492,0.4657,3.7716,3.2683,3.165,0.2823,0.0191,2.7188,4.1456,8.5469,0.7872,5.5626,3.0583,5.3269,0.8878,1.7625,1.4305,6.2968,0.2439,8.8798,1.1751,7.8487,6.6679,3.8983,11.1768,8.7248,0.3467,4.6925,0.7623,6.1441,7.6788,2.2507,6.0489,7.8153,6.3068,3.6386,1.861,3.724,6.3907,1.4851,3.6457,7.9843,5.3975,3.4258,6.0963,1.3769,4.4682,4.0394,2.2739,1.7935,3.2334,4.429,1.3297,3.7979,0.0936,0.6516,3.4335,1.8635,1.4264,3.3778,2.309,1.9951,2.6901,1.3842,2.42,0.1138,6.8723,1.0545,1.2715,2.1364,4.3949,0.8933,3.5125,6.7309,2.1405,0.3198,4.6443,0.4302,3.8013,1.3326,0.0141,2.2892,4.2209,7.0536,3.0903,0.2296,1.967,0.0732,1.8464,1.467,4.6196,3.0389,3.0703,1.847,6.4431,5.3625,3.8894,1.2086,2.8503,8.0624,0.7542,8.1216,5.3537,3.4035,0.2589,4.6419,1.8301,5.5515,3.4742,1.5719,2.0275,0.9635,6.0198,0.3735,0.5014,1.4418,3.0169,2.9,2.4624,2.1378,0.5206,2.5339,6.6587,3.1122,1.4907,1.1149,0.832,0.4628,3.1752,5.4218,5.5483,0.685,1.9146,0.7405,2.7784,2.5164,2.1619,0.0149,0.0115,0.0382,1.3789,1.9151,2.5529,1.5916,1.493,9.6982,4.2327,0.9951,5.4856,6.2895,2.055,3.1863,1.7336,0.2217,0.1521,0.3126,0.3801,0.8646,0.0203,0.0172,0.0179,0.1555,5.6261,0.5194,0.0873,0.752,1.5684,0.3086,0.0069,0.0089,0.0202,8.0171,7.2575,1.0389,2.1717,5.25,1.7762,2.4708,1.3738,1.308,1.7368,2.2581,4.858,4.5725,5.6823,3.0884,3.184,5.8492,2.1742,1.6403,0.2067,2.5945,3.8549,0.7018,0.6452,1.2362,2.6939,1.081,2.3958,3.9701,1.8061,3.121,1.1701,0.6165,8.826,3.321,2.5282,3.5868,0.9456,6.4411,7.6636,1.9949,0.0003,2.5319,3.5935,0.1676,8.268,1.6609,0.813,2.6562,1.092,6.729,1.2538,0.2213,0.49,1.6564,0.7653,1.3248,2.4728,3.9128,0.2066,6.0652,4.6651,0.1486,4.4359,0.0781,0.9422,1.6241,1.8629,0.0813,1.943,0.8916,0.0803,0.6292,0.0172,1.0917,0.0177,0.1709,0.8504,0.1658,0.084,0.0608,5.2275,0.0501,0.8144,6.3683,2.5352,3.3782,2.0482,0.7736,6.7076,2.6135,3.2817,1.1447,7.2878,4.8752,4.3914,1.0517,0.5642,1.8072,1.3086,0.0601,4.2027,4.1914,4.4375,1.8547,0.663,0.347,0.0831,7.5891,1.4927,1.1499,7.2869,1.7583,3.4553,4.8212,0.5157,4.4539,2.1207,0.0756,0.024,0.0804,1.402,0.7839,0.0003,4.3645,0.6219,5.6078,4.4029,3.2316,5.3551,8.578,2.4953,1.0857,1.7015,5.2409,3.1021,0.2231,1.9408,1.3858,2.1357,3.28,0.8554,0.1307,1.4269,0.1788,4.9464,0.351,0.1645,0.2934,0.6643,3.127,1.417,1.5273,1.4918,1.042,0.4281,0.8894,0.0003,3.6488,1.6341,3.3778,3.018,4.3317,0.0646,2.5352,4.0192,5.4279,1.2789,1.047,7.763,0.1697,0.2893,2.8359,8.8386,4.3708,2.0237,0.0907,0.8445,2.1846,2.3799,2.2261,1.0257,7.2165,4.0919,2.6533,2.7558,0.1367,2.0546,0.4814,5.3832,2.4794,2.1965,1.9825,6.5529,3.783,1.0419,1.4678,0.0003,4.0497,2.436,3.4164,1.1927,3.0521,4.3984,0.4916,1.3985,5.2472,0.3277,4.0408,0.3558,0.1033,0.8258,0.0015,3.9807,2.3857,1.4094,0.3428,2.5447,3.348,1.621,2.4518,6.8105,5.398,1.4277,1.3279,2.1079,5.9324,0.5698,0.2491,0.4724,4.2886,1.7947,1.7352,0.2626,0.0727,0.8352,0.8747,3.7288,6.4868,4.0914,0.6656,6.909,1.7226,1.5636,2.3405,1.0697,2.8521,7.3612,0.8835,5.1553,4.3976,4.2315,4.0136,3.7379,6.8852,0.6615,0.087,2.9489,4.048,1.4834,6.3233,6.4129,2.8163,4.1032,4.1974,5.3401,1.4943,0.116,0.3857,4.9203,3.0462,0.3305,1.2482,2.0278,4.4199,0.7428,0.0002,1.7707,5.7811,1.6953,2.0432,5.1461,1.5877,1.8328,1.5303,1.9707,2.8583,0.2165,0.1053,8.1681,2.3945,4.0147,0.6956,1.3618,0.3699,1.0303,1.0606,0.0003,1.4744,3.8722,0.2151,0.6757,4.0477,0.3247,0.7893,4.1155,6.1081,2.2429,0.4105,5.6335,0.5162,0.2077,2.7009,0.7192,0.5313,0.0002,3.2696,2.9848,0.7422,0.5724,0.1823,1.4984,0.4162,0.1349,0.7409,1.1183,5.6502,5.2065,0.7688,3.8118,0.1314,3.0771,0.9145,0.3816,3.4331,0.4346,1.5252,0.466,1.075,2.3262,2.9728,2.2939,1.8622,3.713,5.5875,0.2229,0.1943,1.9737,0.8852,0.4691,0.0002,2.9441,0.6469,3.0483,0.3329,0.4068,1.4996,4.4708,1.5029,0.0096,0.0098,0.0596,0.0367,1.0868,6.1055,3.9345,0.0426,1.1034,6.9675,0.0062,8.4381,1.2248,4.7603,0.005,0.8857,4.5653,5.4758,9.0955,0.0056,1.1963,0.4252,7.3387,0.0002,2.9724,1.0864,0.9524,0.3977,0.6936,2.303,1.9272,1.0582,4.6009,6.9491,0.0445,6.7594,1.7408,1.7603]}
{"id":2529,"ended":true,"length":563,"text":"Gray wolves howl to assemble the pack ( usually before and after hunts ), to pass on an alarm ( particularly at a den site ), to locate each other during a storm, and to communicate threats to one another. They have a limited repertoire of sounds. The most commonly heard is the yap call, a two-syllable warning cry ( the meaning is unknown ). When alarmed ( typically at being surrounded by an intruder ), the pack yaps. The yap call has a range of around 1,200 meters, compared to 1,200 meters for the yarra bark. Wolf howls also play a significant survival role within the pack. Male howls are audible from up to 2,000 m above the pack ground below. Howls and barks are often used to warn members not to move or be afraid, but howls are considered a more effective form of communication. Only a few wolf howls are audible to human beings. Even when howled the pack is unlikely to come in closer than 1 km ( 0.6 mi ). Howls are also used to coordinate ambushes, which sometimes kill the intruder.\n\nFURY : A series of loud, sharp and piercing yapping sounds. Both male and female howl. The howls are made when the pack is alerted by a perceived danger. The howl may come as a single yap, or as six howls at once. It is usually followed by rapid barks ( the so-called yip ). The howl and bark last between one and two minutes.\n\nFIGHTING : Wolf packs usually have at least two alpha males, both of which are older ( the average age is seven or eight in the pack ; most alphas are around eight, and the second oldest alpha is between seven and 15 years of age ). Female breeding begins at the age of three, but a female will often stay with her mother till about eight. Females live up to 19 years in the wild, with an average of 12. Males live up to 17 years in the wild, and an average of 5. There is a greater mortality rate among older wolves. Wolf packs usually stay together, but occasionally they travel alone.\n\nGROUP RATINGS : All members of the pack rate one another as either a friend or an enemy. Each individual's opinion of another is expressed in terms of either a low rating or a high rating. A rating is established on the basis of a pre-set code, and is made on sight of both the rank and breed of the wolf.\n\nINTERACTION WITH PEOPLE : Wolves are most commonly encountered in the wild.

{"id":2740,"ended":true,"length":550,"text":"The earliest indigenous Icelandic music was the r\u00edmur, epic tales from the Viking era that were often performed a cappella. Christianity played a major role in the development of Icelandic music, with the 12th-century Church of Iceland serving as a national music center. The liturgy, the Bible, and the hymns made up the bulk of the mass, with the services divided into eight \"parts\" of varying length depending on the text. These were performed primarily by cantors, with occasional accompaniment from organists, psalm singers, and flautists. The liturgy became popular because the use of choirs was strongly discouraged due to the high status accorded to the clergy. The cantors had long held a monopoly on music in the church and it was a relatively simple matter to change their status to that of professional musicians. The liturgy was combined with a variety of secular music, with a typical ensemble of choristers including a lute player and a chanter (a player of the small lute ). In 1174 a canon law was introduced in which all chants were to be given by the cantors and all secular music was to be restricted to chanters. The secular chansons were originally monodic, but were expanded later. Over the next thousand years, the Church acquired a reputation for providing superior quality music which influenced the secular chanters. In addition to the liturgy, cantors were expected to write religious texts that were used for both secular music and for cantata performances. They also composed new liturgical music of their own, and served as the official scorewriters at the national church. When the national church became the national choir, the cantors were elevated to the position of liturgical authors, and their position was made more important with the introduction of the modern music calendar in 1674. As a result, cantors became the main compositional force in Icelandic music. In the 14th century, the Church of Iceland made major contributions to the music of Europe, and it was this quality which made the Church the first state in Europe to use the Gregorian choral tradition. In the later Middle Ages, Icelandic music underwent many changes based on the changes in musical tastes at the time. A shift in instrumental preferences toward the churchman's lute and the new stringed instrument, the viol, influenced the transition from plainchant into medieval art music. In addition, the rise of the chanter, who was a layman, contributed to an increase in secular polyphonic music. Throughout this period, the Church still played an important role in the creation of music, but by the 16th century secular chanters were composing more music for the Church. In 1674 the chansons of the Icelandic Church were replaced by new compositions. When the national church was converted to Lutheranism in 1712 the Church of Iceland was the only major Icelandic church that retained the Gregorian calendar and retained the chantry system. Other Icelandic churches followed in adopting the Gregorian calendar and a secular chantry system.","token_len":620,"entropy":[9.605,9.8214,10.6734,7.8646,1.1788,3.564,5.3116,2.8231,7.2751,1.7912,10.732,6.9628,3.5192,0.7393,4.2598,1.9592,2.4839,1.9532,4.0911,4.9868,7.8542,5.7656,0.4961,0.1263,2.0514,11.6466,5.4355,0.5693,1.5459,0.1843,0.3174,0.8584,2.8587,0.0619,1.083,0.8428,1.0719,2.863,1.3921,7.8139,0.2873,1.3466,0.0314,5.6938,0.6941,2.7727,5.424,0.0535,1.243,5.731,3.1849,2.3198,0.9045,2.0296,8.5782,0.3581,3.1937,3.5888,5.8643,0.5328,0.5164,0.9654,2.4836,1.7953,0.0001,5.4247,1.3353,0.6677,3.6826,0.0013,0.539,5.189,3.1288,2.6788,1.3283,8.2828,6.4176,0.4613,4.9458,5.3301,6.2945,0.7348,2.4702,6.6939,0.9689,4.9948,0.097,0.3961,7.9203,0.8125,4.1111,2.7026,3.6755,6.1148,1.5007,9.3182,0.5005,1.1323,3.7842,5.7923,4.1752,0.2758,1.7417,7.5883,0.4401,2.0182,7.3369,2.1088,1.7812,1.9231,0.1149,0.5546,5.7945,6.6858,0.197,0.2557,1.6226,3.9801,0.1015,4.093,2.6375,4.2382,2.6863,5.0764,0.0201,7.9226,0.0026,1.9181,7.5124,2.52,4.3929,0.0069,0.6138,3.2263,8.0572,5.3353,0.0078,0.311,1.2895,3.4868,0.9018,1.7726,5.8575,0.7518,4.2407,5.3786,3.3586,2.1943,2.8547,0.3081,2.6894,2.6606,1.3267,3.5269,2.1471,4.7288,0.4259,3.4145,4.7827,3.7106,1.2137,0.56,5.8488,2.5099,7.5311,1.5591,1.969,0.0492,6.3422,0.9888,0.4323,1.7074,4.419,0.0926,0.8974,8.7504,0.0914,2.3998,2.6574,0.0042,6.3481,2.5239,1.1575,3.2771,2.7414,6.8477,7.0629,2.1402,6.45,2.002,1.3908,6.4871,1.9916,5.5397,1.3781,2.5931,1.6502,1.0665,4.2233,8.1454,0.0604,3.1498,2.4805,6.0587,2.5279,1.6626,6.247,4.9792,0.0258,8.2671,3.1468,6.8083,4.5352,3.0032,7.2732,4.1067,1.2216,3.4783,2.7344,2.035,2.5454,8.9885,1.4595,0.9276,0.0985,4.7764,3.7976,1.2156,2.3723,0.4005,2.0036,3.3386,7.5492,0.8518,0.9866,0.2923,0.075,5.1061,0.2953,5.3226,4.9342,0.4579,0.6102,1.2993,7.5094,5.7802,2.5717,7.4156,1.1713,6.9775,6.1933,11.1182,1.3076,1.4269,2.303,4.2199,5.1286,2.0715,6.3699,0.6043,0.8117,5.2122,0.0141,1.1836,0.948,3.969,7.4228,1.1985,2.9275,0.3641,3.9419,6.1995,3.9592,1.0199,5.483,6.181,0.979,6.6726,1.9549,2.138,0.726,1.2579,2.2619,2.9002,0.7182,1.0404,2.6359,0.1457,0.2736,6.9155,0.2347,2.0823,4.6176,0.0227,5.0469,5.1697,2.4314,3.3304,1.2243,4.3926,2.6205,4.9354,3.2678,3.344,0.0895,2.7922,6.425,8.9792,6.2382,0.3111,4.8158,1.6284,5.5234,5.0741,3.9991,1.2333,2.2484,4.8608,2.7603,0.0043,1.013,2.5945,6.1466,0.176,1.7588,4.1459,7.9269,5.8433,5.0903,1.3237,5.1021,3.1575,0.7691,5.0635,0.8555,6.0464,1.0718,2.755,2.7988,3.7004,4.2377,0.5766,1.2838,1.4229,0.2745,1.5811,7.9769,0.2678,0.8291,2.8997,0.0297,5.1037,0.8528,3.8838,1.5826,1.3435,2.691,8.0064,1.1786,5.1219,2.2529,1.9599,4.3662,0.344,2.1717,0.0094,0.875,4.9239,4.3518,6.7244,2.6935,4.4473,4.9881,0.1916,4.119,1.3983,0.2348,0.4654,3.2517,0.213,2.0981,1.5932,2.8513,3.6672,9.0769,2.1502,0.7216,2.7144,0.3191,1.0339,2.4002,1.9134,4.5177,0.157,0.1277,0.6625,1.0067,3.1157,2.3163,0.3757,4.8673,4.252,1.2032,0.174,0.8187,2.387,0.6594,4.3043,1.1251,2.0976,2.9214,1.0438,1.9945,6.694,2.0005,2.1843,1.2699,3.258,1.8593,3.7942,4.5696,2.5872,1.3748,0.0781,3.3335,1.197,8.7338,0.0061,8.1465,2.318,3.8304,0.5902,2.112,1.5045,5.0985,3.8215,0.0026,0.3382,5.2988,0.7879,4.5875,3.869,0.4808,6.0479,0.1406,0.9601,3.0503,0.566,4.7149,3.2224,5.9835,0.6463,0.3185,0.3883,4.1928,4.6971,0.5475,6.9998,8.5344,4.7739,1.2798,6.3448,9.4155,3.2922,6.5212,0.1307,1.7627,2.2108,5.3374,6.8828,1.872,1.6114,2.5566,1.5047,4.9629,3.8807,5.1039,0.6116,6.6735,0.5172,8.4958,7.7584,5.3099,6.6333,6.9597,4.3965,0.3928,1.9223,2.3579,0.4365,0.8861,4.3563,0.123,1.0348,4.4533,4.7277,0.0603,2.0753,4.3,2.1775,2.3761,6.8905,0.7868,0.9668,3.5803,0.3563,4.2683,1.4796,0.1197,6.623,9.4071,3.605,0.0607,0.9647,0.891,5.3964,2.2144,0.2762,0.2174,0.7738,2.0563,5.8829,2.2738,3.0543,0.2061,0.207,0.1219,1.0203,4.7205,0.2537,2.4553,1.6563,2.6386,5.506,0.407,2.6081,0.2711,0.0435,6.574,2.2461,0.6838,0.2726,1.0796,9.1766,3.4438,3.4283,2.8654,0.9844,3.1238,1.4669,1.8187,1.7827,3.8205,1.3205,4.3966,3.0274,0.521,1.5854,0.4963,3.6193,1.9742,1.0075,3.5282,0.1409,4.7733,5.5697,2.6706,5.6442,0.5886,5.2546,1.168,1.7976,5.0976,0.4935,4.4796,0.2703,0.6338,2.1901,3.7003,2.8211,2.9852,2.234,0.1787,2.1457,3.1937,2.4277,3.0574,7.0289,2.0236,2.5449,2.4466,1.1966,5.0489,0.0107,4.5264,2.433,4.8594,1.199,4.8267,6.2475,3.1101,0.6502,6.3138,4.331,1.4172,4.1368,2.621,4.788,0.425,0.7193,0.0067,0.3499,1.6751,5.1469,4.7152,0.9789,1.8989,0.6182,0.7298]}
{"id":3642,"ended":true,"length":527,"text":"In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Isdud had a population of 2 @, @ 566 ; 2 @, @ 555 Muslims and 11 Christians, in a total of 5,766 dwellings.In the 1931 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Isdud had a population of 2,743, all Muslim, increasing in the 1931 census year by 1.5% (4,918 persons). The total population included 521 Muslims, 1,743 Jews, 6 Christians and 3 others. At the time of the 1948 Israel and Jordan war Isdud had a population of 6,534 Arabs.\n\nIsdud (Arabic: \u0625\u0633\u062f\u0648\u062f) is a Palestinian village in the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate in the northern West Bank, at a distance of 33 kilometers west of Ramallah and 14 kilometers south-east of al-Bireh. It is the seat of Isdud Municipality. It is also a community in Area E of the West Bank under partial Israeli occupation. It is the birthplace of former PM Rafidah Al-Sabbagh, who founded the Al-Wasat (\u201cReturn\u201d) Palestinian political movement and headed the movement from the village up to 1989.\n\nIsdud is under the full control of the Palestinian Authority.\n\nIn July 2006, Israeli settlers tried to evict Isdud's residents, while other Israeli settlers tried to forcibly take part in this eviction. During the incident Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and rubber coated steel bullets at the Palestinian protesters. When the violence between the Palestinian protestors and the settlers escalated, Israeli soldiers opened fire at the Palestinian protestors, leaving dozens of Palestinians wounded.\n\nIn late October 2010, 15 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli occupation forces when Israeli forces violently raided the town to arrest Palestinian activists. Isdud is located in Area C, which is under total Israeli control of the movement of people and goods, except for a few select military bases along the borders and in certain key roads.\n\nPalestinian Media Watch reported on 29 November 2010 that the Israeli military had destroyed four more water wells in Isdud during the last month, bringing the number of destroyed wells to at least 37 since November 2008. The Israeli army's reason for construction of an underground barrier on village land was to prevent Palestinians from digging for natural water resources.\n\nOn 29 October 2014, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) forces stormed Isdud and destroyed a Palestinian-owned garage that was used as a makeshift school. As Israeli soldiers attacked the building, students inside were forced to run from the building. An 8-year-old who had been inside the building was also wounded. On 11 November 2014, a similar incident occurred with Israeli troops destroying a building used as a shop in the marketplace of Isdud. The school has served local students through the years since the Palestinian Authority built a school in the village and it is not known why it was destroyed.","token_len":621,"entropy":[2.6222,12.1689,4.9009,2.5438,6.8949,0.328,9.4506,0.4614,0.467,3.2411,5.4916,0.0069,4.9067,0.3914,10.0871,6.5089,6.8038,4.1217,2.5317,1.0483,0.0385,3.1412,16.8994,6.2678,9.2779,4.756,6.1605,5.9542,4.5263,2.5086,0.5391,1.4446,6.5906,10.4378,1.8441,5.3526,3.1763,2.0734,4.4483,2.2318,1.9728,0.2803,3.1468,1.0779,4.0612,3.6647,6.8428,0.6353,6.5836,1.299,5.8229,0.1554,0.4508,0.3135,6.3933,0.0034,0.0385,0.0886,0.0047,0.0012,0.0134,0.0374,0.5349,0.0067,0.001,0.0682,0.0325,0.0506,0.002,0.8254,2.4446,3.6255,4.7108,2.1285,7.1189,5.3601,1.8825,11.3277,5.1465,2.5822,5.1722,0.4106,5.4499,1.7781,1.9787,2.5159,2.2974,2.4368,2.604,4.5165,0.6281,3.1615,4.5089,4.0183,1.2739,2.8528,2.7678,1.2847,6.9063,3.9124,5.4064,3.4288,1.2758,3.438,0.1149,3.538,2.7836,3.9404,0.5681,3.7152,8.721,1.2297,2.6971,4.1702,1.0356,5.9291,0.4297,1.7336,0.326,0.5565,3.2987,4.9199,6.1689,3.7343,1.9986,8.3553,0.0185,0.0019,0.6624,0.3062,0.2122,0.0556,3.3868,0.6637,3.9782,2.5775,6.4332,2.5787,3.0546,0.0012,4.8165,0.1978,0.0038,4.2653,4.3599,1.1682,0.2574,1.6607,3.4278,2.7675,4.5779,2.8699,3.0201,1.0401,0.9769,1.4661,4.0783,3.7473,1.2434,0.4939,6.7156,0.2118,4.2477,3.9161,0.0851,3.4279,6.6511,0.2864,6.2719,0.6757,2.1467,0.5776,3.4315,1.3326,0.0009,2.0625,5.8126,2.1083,2.3143,0.1245,6.1353,2.7228,5.9799,0.2057,2.2904,0.0013,2.4083,5.924,0.3393,1.5628,3.258,0.7424,0.0438,1.9028,0.0164,0.7523,0.0155,0.0022,0.4792,1.4921,0.5856,2.1845,4.8797,0.0248,4.4639,0.1245,0.0047,6.7899,0.0019,1.638,2.1563,0.6764,3.3037,2.4713,5.563,2.6143,6.265,3.5602,1.5959,0.5734,1.7833,0.0022,4.6068,9.9062,0.9535,1.3327,0.6761,2.24,0.7204,2.3473,4.0699,0.0767,5.5969,8.4961,6.2902,5.9369,5.5865,3.1464,0.5151,3.445,5.8863,0.9455,1.2175,1.7961,3.0233,1.3884,5.4029,0.2379,6.2302,3.4789,3.7794,10.2658,7.3568,10.2322,6.0679,6.4374,0.6804,5.9327,4.1729,1.9163,2.5633,5.3158,0.6736,3.5145,2.8301,2.7912,3.7156,7.2983,0.4563,5.7654,0.2841,0.9753,0.0002,2.2835,0.0307,0.0031,1.3285,5.1393,1.2927,7.2631,0.9932,0.039,0.5942,1.5982,0.3017,1.898,1.9303,0.0002,3.1617,4.6987,4.4716,0.4459,3.6585,2.592,6.2624,0.0681,2.6859,0.6197,0.0092,0.0021,2.776,1.3344,2.7084,5.095,5.2966,3.4794,0.5129,2.1295,0.048,3.8969,3.4975,5.3486,0.1281,6.0708,2.4426,0.6069,4.5709,0.5167,4.9292,3.4019,3.4341,3.2654,1.3656,0.177,1.0866,1.2077,8.8965,4.069,0.9306,0.9544,1.0345,3.353,4.1821,1.0033,5.2033,0.9534,6.17,6.3228,1.1125,3.0935,2.7661,0.0372,1.6065,1.2362,2.1399,1.0201,1.8098,1.2185,3.0248,0.0064,2.3342,0.4863,2.8217,1.8232,1.449,4.8955,4.241,1.0327,1.4629,2.3123,0.5272,1.2115,0.0002,1.86,3.598,3.28,3.9715,0.5014,7.7797,1.6966,0.5006,3.6445,1.2952,1.3537,1.1225,0.3259,4.2502,0.5156,3.7501,1.0046,2.1278,5.1526,2.844,1.4082,4.6058,7.582,2.3272,3.7313,2.0439,1.2511,5.524,0.0217,0.0018,2.4704,2.0038,1.0273,2.838,2.0926,2.4775,3.3152,0.8878,1.9699,6.2161,0.089,1.3397,5.6751,0.6378,8.3784,2.6177,3.8205,1.6253,2.7088,2.5247,6.5531,0.6094,2.9083,1.7112,7.2174,6.4024,3.9978,5.8182,0.2851,3.5556,3.7355,2.2668,4.8394,6.6932,5.2004,0.7114,0.841,0.0002,5.4694,6.8837,5.0889,3.4355,1.6381,6.2703,2.8947,1.1638,0.8529,2.1064,1.5471,2.12,1.9521,3.8787,3.8479,6.7732,7.1217,2.0146,1.2579,1.1658,0.0085,0.0016,3.5091,0.6332,4.1123,3.3698,2.5828,6.0478,0.476,1.8455,0.187,5.7659,0.1429,0.3441,3.7495,0.0017,5.2229,4.3753,4.1565,3.2991,0.2085,1.9643,2.069,1.7595,3.4084,9.4341,0.1372,8.0006,0.5402,5.1917,2.2894,7.51,3.4792,8.6903,2.0407,1.3443,1.1989,1.162,2.5513,0.1915,4.5406,3.6528,4.5919,2.471,2.8225,0.9689,0.984,0.0002,2.3533,3.1556,2.2434,3.9788,0.2076,3.5093,7.495,0.0448,1.2389,0.0759,0.0043,0.0439,4.5741,4.0075,2.0371,0.0033,0.0012,2.1297,2.6999,2.4323,4.1245,3.4497,0.4279,8.3564,2.9345,1.2343,1.2987,1.2046,0.3072,4.6344,5.6195,1.1993,4.6682,5.0158,2.0826,4.6327,0.5057,3.362,0.4377,6.6752,5.418,1.49,2.8881,0.1471,3.3287,2.2163,0.2259,1.6626,1.275,4.6211,6.1562,0.6593,0.2443,0.1435,0.0011,7.2435,2.0288,0.8956,4.422,0.8628,1.5069,1.4285,2.7754,2.8299,1.0056,3.7443,3.5866,1.2862,0.7018,0.2711,2.4278,6.7932,0.4838,0.5047,3.6014,2.7433,2.5026,3.2462,1.1193,3.7216,2.9823,0.7177,0.2722,6.7127,2.7201,1.2939,11.5055,0.5704,1.0353,0.0125,0.0019,0.8279,2.4101,4.4767,4.268,6.2075,9.0871,3.5198,5.4398,0.9098,1.8069,3.7759,1.8208,4.8899,2.3983,4.5162,1.2369,2.4705,1.5851,1.1576,1.1035,3.0105,4.5221,1.3741,3.8504,2.0222,3.1917,2.5599,0.5061,0.6386,0.2746]}
{"id":3943,"ended":true,"length":596,"text":"The campus south of the river consists mostly of post @ - @ World War II International Style buildings, and is characterized by sparser foliage, relatively straight roadways, and many parking lots. The center of the campus between the river and campus hill is much busier and more urban, and is characterized primarily by its central parking lots, an attractive lawn, and landscaped trees and shrubs between the street and the parking lots. Although this urban area is the home of many of the residential halls and student offices, it is also host, in the early spring, to a popular and traditional Easter Egg hunt and picnic. In addition, there is a popular track and field area on the western side of the campus ( bordered by the river on one side and campus on the other two ), as well as a small, landscaped lawn area to the west of the parking lots. The track and field area is a typical campus grass area that is well cared for and is in constant usage.\n\nOther notable buildings in this area include both a large, centrally located dormitory, known jokingly as \"Dormitory No. @ \", and a residential complex for women, known jokingly as \"House No. @ \", in the form of a row of four apartment buildings. There is also a small chapel on the southern edge of the campus, and many dining facilities, including a main campus dining hall and a cafeteria, are clustered around the campus center. South of the river is the home of both University Police and Public Safety. The north part of this site is covered by a series of hills, which are the location of the central administrative building and residence halls ( primarily \"North Campus \" and \"South Campus\" ). The northern hill of the campus rises to a height of, and the southern end of this area is bordered by a long, paved, two - lane roadway to the left and right, providing access to the interstate ( I - 44), and the Missouri River ( Missouri - 160), respectively.\n\nThe campus south of the river consists mostly of post - @ International Style buildings. There are several dormitories, as well as a large central dormitory called \"Dormitory No. 1 \". There are also several academic buildings, mainly research and science-oriented. However, the campus is not known for having many student life facilities, aside from an extensive dining facility. Several dormitories, including \"Dormitory @\", are situated near the southern portion of the campus, and the southernmost residence hall is located on the southernmost of the campus hills. The roadways on campus are paved in most places, and have a very nice, even distribution between both lanes and the median. Parking lots and walkways are available on the grassy areas of campus, making it a great place for students to \"camp\" during the summer. South of the river is the location of the annual Easter Egg hunt. The campus also has a very active track club, and a very good tennis team. The campus also has several, small but well maintained, exercise facilities.","token_len":621,"entropy":[10.0119,9.7617,0.0692,1.2309,5.0385,8.4858,3.6197,0.0079,7.7463,13.8566,8.1848,5.1583,8.9134,3.2014,0.2239,7.9661,8.5458,2.8817,1.7916,3.2043,2.4051,5.8401,0.0641,7.6107,4.6483,8.0171,1.3016,6.3038,5.7381,7.6538,1.3163,0.4528,0.6386,4.9625,5.6574,0.7709,0.4622,1.8097,5.0386,0.4369,0.6882,0.5982,8.1435,1.195,3.1273,0.1425,3.5098,7.6578,0.5973,6.4135,6.2503,0.0041,2.2326,1.8921,5.4091,2.0667,1.7487,1.9282,3.6517,5.4427,0.0276,3.1271,5.3114,3.1748,2.5294,1.7323,5.153,4.3925,5.4194,0.8828,0.4748,5.8601,0.6209,4.015,3.0755,2.4484,0.068,9.5883,0.6773,4.5744,0.3628,0.7218,3.0126,1.9051,0.1421,5.7627,3.4962,5.7578,2.3213,0.711,4.604,3.7513,0.2069,2.3175,2.6593,0.3065,8.7954,8.3118,1.5297,4.1614,4.5949,0.4148,1.0397,0.5565,1.2172,7.513,7.936,3.5546,2.9603,4.9723,5.6491,0.643,0.3307,2.0295,4.7643,4.2957,7.1686,9.2809,3.2053,0.688,3.2787,4.838,0.5879,3.4806,1.7878,0.8326,2.8128,0.9337,0.7189,3.8106,8.418,2.1899,1.3527,4.3973,2.9222,0.5402,4.5302,0.693,0.1124,0.4667,0.2381,3.7584,11.9274,4.3113,0.1084,1.3825,3.464,4.0348,2.7667,0.0684,0.395,3.5409,0.3741,0.0165,0.0172,7.4965,7.5916,3.4495,0.0396,0.0052,0.9305,3.7609,2.9175,5.3351,0.018,4.0936,4.6172,4.187,0.4544,1.6976,0.96,0.3185,3.2199,1.4114,0.5863,1.7903,7.1567,0.6074,0.0412,0.5418,0.9164,2.9378,4.6981,4.1788,8.6833,2.9147,3.2929,1.2346,3.4529,4.9775,0.0245,1.0366,2.7983,5.0236,4.7087,6.0021,0.9115,2.1896,0.025,5.3956,4.1034,2.8387,1.8073,2.0809,1.175,0.4069,6.8714,2.1069,3.2442,2.2942,6.183,0.5477,5.2386,0.3015,2.1672,6.3578,12.3325,5.6959,0.1039,1.8139,4.7803,3.4735,1.4042,4.0331,0.0555,11.7915,8.3108,0.5609,0.55,5.6995,3.3721,5.2458,3.9721,2.2451,2.0341,7.5156,0.0008,0.052,0.1043,4.2382,0.6687,0.0361,0.7043,1.6542,4.0212,1.9828,4.3362,0.0067,0.8125,6.6506,0.2817,3.6943,4.8565,0.3788,1.4529,4.1055,1.2345,0.4889,0.314,2.826,6.3508,2.5781,0.4142,3.9941,3.324,0.0331,0.2325,0.4108,0.977,2.1226,4.3807,6.3553,2.7842,1.924,0.7897,1.1556,6.0485,4.6144,2.2898,0.5953,1.6031,1.0102,3.6739,0.7869,1.1088,6.4381,1.5356,0.5809,2.4057,5.1346,0.3967,8.1422,0.3978,0.4303,2.4058,1.8435,1.4629,6.1126,0.0898,5.3459,4.7656,6.5359,2.1656,6.9779,0.5791,2.1937,1.8869,5.6033,4.3346,0.0113,2.9381,4.7919,0.6646,4.3497,0.9891,1.2355,3.8388,0.0011,4.8187,1.182,2.0999,1.3908,4.631,5.2371,0.1163,1.7733,6.2216,6.7552,1.3536,2.644,4.9809,1.0781,3.4068,10.7071,5.4462,6.4929,2.2286,2.4689,1.8464,0.2257,1.215,0.0164,3.2814,0.8186,1.4852,4.0297,5.3159,2.4307,0.7282,1.2347,6.0687,1.5849,1.7302,0.9827,0.1066,8.3239,1.7205,3.6619,2.7635,4.3152,0.1704,4.9347,3.6566,1.0707,8.1104,0.0009,0.112,1.3268,5.0952,1.0798,3.7439,2.3335,5.1634,9.9055,3.8018,3.2491,3.6456,0.5404,4.5218,1.3958,1.5218,2.2449,6.1095,1.3616,0.3279,0.8063,7.6829,3.8004,6.813,4.9428,8.353,4.802,1.6594,1.2913,7.4478,1.0924,0.7659,7.6413,1.6224,7.1963,1.8461,4.796,0.2067,1.5719,0.0003,1.7275,2.2628,2.4624,0.0766,0.0547,0.0471,0.3413,0.4526,0.0029,0.1066,4.5837,0.1395,3.4831,0.0465,0.0571,3.9844,3.6808,0.4366,2.3709,5.5561,0.4071,0.0,1.6997,4.0635,0.1071,0.0065,1.373,1.4469,5.1952,4.0697,0.0164,5.4228,0.6261,2.0981,0.0785,0.0671,0.0458,0.0178,5.2294,4.3199,2.5588,0.5503,0.5959,1.614,5.904,1.208,0.9349,5.7934,5.9704,1.4349,4.685,4.5009,2.2122,2.2597,5.4412,0.0138,1.3289,2.1603,2.4053,2.0996,4.1977,0.6718,3.2925,1.4372,3.7726,4.607,3.2231,0.8432,5.8938,0.0066,3.4323,3.8637,4.3124,2.6725,1.2682,5.0108,3.3771,0.1393,0.0011,2.4083,1.4848,2.0148,1.1866,0.0084,0.0287,10.8876,1.6689,1.0295,3.7115,3.2891,0.3925,4.4423,4.6911,0.0094,0.2446,0.2637,0.9405,1.2352,2.3395,3.2496,2.621,4.7752,0.2642,1.1945,0.845,1.6359,0.3021,2.7498,4.0356,3.4525,0.2672,1.314,3.9842,0.4217,1.3247,7.6429,2.7791,2.8071,3.0291,1.0288,4.1776,3.7535,4.4382,1.5747,0.4873,1.1013,4.6007,1.914,2.9599,4.2068,2.3755,5.711,8.1201,4.3432,4.4693,5.6526,4.2347,1.9758,6.1908,0.7067,5.9762,1.1107,2.3469,4.9211,0.262,0.8722,4.7883,1.5727,0.917,7.5377,1.0614,2.54,2.2289,3.2581,1.229,6.0697,1.5085,1.5762,1.9196,1.1112,1.8104,2.3584,0.3337,5.9831,4.1118,1.0077,3.3931,0.5163,1.3181,1.1856,7.2126,0.1685,0.2999,0.3166,1.0548,0.7296,4.8859,0.1054,0.5807,7.2921,3.8565,0.1576,0.3661,1.9767,1.939,3.7524,4.1466,0.5803,0.844,4.1088,3.7259,5.853,7.4381,0.8275,1.8609,2.2168,3.8988,3.5445,5.937,3.8426,0.689,1.8245,2.5095,2.642,0.1938,2.3987,6.2187,4.3226,5.0038,1.8159,2.0091,1.5816,8.3653,0.6769,1.4457]}
{"id":3924,"ended":true,"length":593,"text":"Feminist literary historians have tended to define the figure of She as a literary manifestation of male alarm over the `` learned and crusading new woman ``. In this view, Ayesha is a young scholar who, like her male counterparts, finds her career threatened by women who challenge the assumed legitimacy of male authority, knowledge, and `` common sense \u00bb. (7) Women like Ayesha are characterized by an ``incoherent \u00bb personality (8) whose ``inner world is a place without men; a universe without order, knowledge, or power ; and [the female protagonist ] is a lonely creature, and, of course, lonely. That means she is not only a victim of her own male self-centeredness but also a victim of her sex; she has not only a sense of isolation but also a deep sense of inferiority ; she is at once a victim of male ignorance and male violence ; and a victim of sexual frustration. This view of She has become a standard for the study of contemporary fiction and in most areas of feminist scholarship (9).\n\nOther critics have rejected She as an image of masculine panic regarding women in modern fiction. They have seen She as only one possible image of the female psyche in the age of the novel, and, as such, not a universal one. (10) They have looked for other images as well, such as Ayesha's sister, who is both a rival for her husband and a symbol of ``male anxiety about being left alone with his daughter after a few years of marriage. `` (11) This image of the woman who fears that her husband will become sexually and emotionally dependent on the child seems to illustrate the concerns of female literary critics.\n\nWomen are presented as victimized subjects of men in contemporary fiction by the author's awareness of female literary history (12) and her ability to exploit feminist themes. (13) By taking a feminist position on what is generally acknowledged to be a male interest, the author may draw attention to the importance of the female character and her representation in fiction. The image of the female victim, which is one of the most persistent in literature, serves as an effective theme of feminist criticism.\n\nA number of feminist critics have questioned the assumption that She is a universal, and often unconscious, image of female desire in the age of the novel. (14) They point out that She is often female subjectivity in crisis, or a woman frustrated in her search for self- identity and self-knowledge. (15) Since She is often both objectified and identified with her male counterpart, readers tend to interpret the text as a confrontation between the two sexes. This interpretation may or may not have feminist overtones. An objectified She is often interpreted as the embodiment of women's passive victimization by men. In contrast, the female subject who is identified with her male counterpart may be a conscious feminist statement of female rage against men. However, the female She may sometimes be an unconscious reflection of feminine anxiety regarding the relation between the sexes and the place of women in society.","token_len":621,"entropy":[10.1316,1.2055,9.9323,7.0396,1.791,5.1397,0.0638,5.1462,1.8195,7.5068,0.3788,7.7998,8.2896,1.0823,6.0217,8.1921,0.2556,4.5953,13.1414,5.2247,1.0624,12.7076,15.869,2.7389,11.8668,0.3778,5.9786,4.7805,3.0904,2.1071,3.0427,2.5944,2.4371,0.1728,7.0646,6.2872,0.0027,1.6949,1.5547,5.1599,5.1883,1.2119,2.4377,2.6224,2.3469,2.488,1.4206,0.2629,3.9493,2.5926,3.868,7.6157,0.2381,4.5162,1.7015,5.0979,2.4946,7.2394,7.2836,0.079,3.0107,1.1648,2.5572,9.303,0.4886,0.3415,9.2001,7.4786,0.2894,12.7704,1.0329,3.9287,6.1276,0.1072,4.6509,5.0068,1.1782,0.0106,0.0001,1.4594,5.4769,0.4389,2.5514,5.0141,5.1532,5.716,0.4009,11.6366,7.0136,4.9127,4.9275,0.7836,2.5491,4.7104,7.8279,4.6784,2.9863,2.8123,5.6637,5.4935,3.2264,4.9719,2.2707,7.2884,1.1919,8.1358,1.3535,5.6842,0.2238,1.56,4.668,4.6868,1.2759,7.4268,3.3146,3.9931,4.9012,5.0333,1.2195,1.8542,5.8047,5.2514,2.5795,4.6259,4.5259,5.2527,0.3444,0.0308,6.1656,2.8618,5.1415,5.4933,2.0121,1.1239,2.1347,3.0233,1.6638,4.088,0.4723,2.9212,0.7968,3.6078,5.1206,0.3232,4.5659,0.3556,1.8556,0.7591,1.3503,1.6209,0.0887,2.1698,7.6339,5.5832,1.7856,2.9363,4.1551,2.5563,1.8983,4.3991,0.0469,6.6411,1.3699,0.3899,0.5768,4.4327,1.2338,0.0482,4.9665,0.0137,4.8007,1.3622,0.9194,5.5828,1.8352,1.1479,2.4884,0.2717,3.0486,5.7337,0.7607,3.31,4.643,2.5417,0.7632,1.8444,1.2276,0.0688,5.4248,4.115,1.4309,3.3761,4.087,1.354,3.4148,3.2804,3.642,1.9374,4.9705,2.5364,2.5828,4.8153,0.0395,3.8014,5.5607,1.4266,5.7038,5.2149,5.0437,0.3238,3.6154,2.1529,3.5004,1.6515,0.9014,2.8529,0.0376,5.9607,4.0854,1.4474,5.1916,3.8819,1.0719,2.0835,6.8143,0.315,5.3211,6.2091,7.6256,1.9983,3.3497,4.6933,1.2959,0.8764,3.502,1.1604,5.0198,2.6739,0.1277,6.5847,3.0265,6.042,4.1523,0.3688,1.6107,2.6122,4.5715,2.8471,2.0858,5.6757,0.0449,2.0299,5.0649,1.4692,1.4457,3.4048,2.2712,0.932,0.0134,5.8285,2.0642,5.6578,2.6915,0.3994,2.6272,0.132,0.0117,2.7846,0.5599,6.0747,1.1976,3.5729,3.0668,4.7672,0.4622,0.8915,1.603,0.006,4.3948,0.4495,0.0001,0.551,5.0768,1.141,2.6552,1.4361,5.2637,1.3877,8.9961,4.2223,2.2498,4.7534,1.2203,1.0708,5.645,0.2282,5.2058,4.0287,3.7622,3.4322,3.7323,4.2846,0.8571,3.8941,2.3156,3.2108,6.8159,2.4661,5.4506,1.6756,0.6218,1.3101,2.9695,5.2407,1.5829,0.0639,0.0212,4.4036,5.7386,1.3752,2.1496,2.9017,3.3043,5.9149,3.8219,1.1832,1.248,1.2678,4.0198,5.9889,4.9425,0.8212,4.0301,0.8268,5.2683,3.2019,5.211,0.6519,7.8951,1.1627,7.019,0.4173,4.487,4.5319,1.2472,1.9302,2.2169,0.0002,4.427,2.6602,6.9386,0.611,6.4352,6.3659,2.7343,4.5311,3.7449,2.0545,0.4569,3.5838,1.9907,3.6183,2.2793,10.5739,0.6179,4.6895,5.2905,4.5275,3.4998,0.5582,1.6515,0.3303,2.0652,4.1737,0.039,5.8996,6.2258,3.7255,2.1603,1.7022,0.0738,0.0089,4.8707,4.9569,2.4105,3.9784,2.2729,1.1945,5.6202,1.89,4.9073,4.4656,0.9508,0.0263,1.3871,2.0331,6.66,1.1609,1.973,0.62,3.9811,5.4618,1.383,0.1658,0.951,5.2307,0.0578,2.2053,2.1116,1.8993,1.986,2.3051,7.7565,0.6483,2.9234,0.7095,2.9197,6.8792,0.2573,1.194,1.4444,5.8348,2.4331,3.7638,1.3212,4.7604,0.6059,1.1465,1.488,6.046,3.0088,3.561,0.3945,4.7769,0.7205,1.6135,4.0312,7.7209,2.5,2.2435,2.4126,0.8239,1.473,0.0002,3.0751,3.7582,0.0049,2.08,1.4191,0.5482,4.051,0.6484,5.5753,0.2123,3.8645,0.6392,1.0112,6.3015,3.2099,4.1587,4.4597,4.8885,0.3117,1.1982,0.241,1.7076,5.6394,2.8995,2.317,2.7717,0.0101,0.3753,0.0416,0.2885,1.1095,0.0318,0.0581,2.5301,4.1227,0.7849,0.2211,2.7763,0.7531,2.0315,7.0374,6.6367,1.6625,1.8682,10.1523,1.0058,4.1469,3.3407,3.9131,9.0512,4.3621,0.6619,5.0597,0.0914,3.6787,0.3434,9.3725,1.7426,1.9743,0.0336,3.7908,0.613,0.6387,0.0113,0.0071,7.003,2.4807,0.5068,1.3255,5.3092,5.9802,1.896,0.1618,5.3406,1.103,2.9886,1.1891,2.109,0.2199,6.4938,4.1174,0.0459,2.9241,2.2902,6.7467,0.6452,1.3858,6.4119,0.727,1.7279,1.1951,2.6604,0.8277,3.7067,1.686,2.7339,5.3579,0.0011,0.0013,3.556,7.8064,6.4867,0.0001,0.8121,5.8799,5.9785,2.5051,2.6297,1.2152,0.9526,4.3328,0.2748,3.0378,4.0816,0.0445,5.1191,0.4399,8.275,6.0322,0.9103,3.5223,1.3814,1.1919,3.3219,2.9552,0.1631,1.9363,2.537,2.7895,4.7957,1.211,4.1134,0.3136,0.7667,0.2012,0.0387,3.6455,0.9322,2.4719,5.7948,5.0957,7.9563,0.9822,3.3664,6.5133,2.9402,1.9126,0.9139,5.9098,0.0126,1.7872,3.25,4.219,3.0832,5.2691,0.6004,3.3006,2.8806,3.9647,0.152,5.9885,4.1553,4.9541,1.5144,7.9328,0.7724,1.7172,1.1371,2.4012,1.178,6.7313,0.546,1.6549,0.3793,2.6437,0.3311]}
{"id":17,"ended":true,"length":553,"text":"Green background indicates win ( 2 points ). Red background indicates regulation loss ( 0 points ). Silver background indicates overtime \/ shootout loss ( 1 point ). = = Player statistics are based on the player's highest level of play during the 2014\u201315 NHL regular season, including AHL assignments. Stats from other leagues\/year are only for reference. The player's rank is determined by \"average\" games played (see more below ).\n\nAll statistics come from Eliteprospects.com, HockeyReference.com, NHL.com, or my memory.\n\nA note on the use of AHL play: The AHL is a great league, but it offers only a small sample size (i.e. the entire season). It also has a different style of play as teams don't just play for the win but to keep their playoff position. That said, there isn't really much a \"worst case scenario\", so we will use games played in the AHL as is (for that reason, most games below have a red background indicating a loss).\n\nA further note on the use of \"average games played\": I have had to adjust or extrapolate games played for players that were sent to the WCH (for example, Ryan Pulock) and traded (i.e. Brandon Davidson). The WCH is a tournament in which players get assigned to teams, not play as individuals. Players that were traded were almost all playing in teams' top defensive pairings when they were sent to the WCH. I decided to just use the average of the other player's games that were played at the time (which means that the actual number of games played was the average between the two players).\n\nPlayer notes\n\nAron Gunnarsson was the only player that left the team in the offseason that was still with the team on the list (no surprise there).\n\nThere are five players on the list that were acquired in the offseason but missed the start of the WCH.\n\nThere are also five players on the list that were acquired in the season but missed the start of the WCH.\n\nRyan Pulock played in the WCH which may be why he is not on the chart.\n\nBrock Nelson and Travis Hamonic missed the WCH because they were playing in the NHL.\n\nThere was an error on Justin Schmelzer. He played 13 games in the QMJHL and 18 NHL games.\n\nThere was also an error on Brendan Guhle.

{"id":2114,"ended":true,"length":576,"text":"Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman's primary goal was to create a simpler and more accessible gameplay model than those presented in previous Lucasfilm titles. Gilbert had conceived the main designs and puzzles before working together with the team, but Schafer and Grossman helped them to realize their ideas, including a focus on linear, connected levels. The game was also inspired by The Secret of Monkey Island, and the team tried to capture the same feeling of \"playful slapstick\", with many of the puzzles requiring players to \"silly\" themselves to solve.[2]\n\nThe trio of designers also considered how to make use of the hardware of the original system. On the original NES, the only way to increase the size of text was with the use of graphical elements in certain locations. However, the developers on the NES version realized that they could use the NES hardware to create various effects to increase the screen space, such as \"sprites\", \"sprinklers\" and even \"squiggly\" lines. The team was also inspired by the use of \"flashing\" text in the Atari 2600 game Space Invaders and used that technique in the NES Zapper game.[2][3]\n\nThe game was originally intended to be released in November 1983 but the development team was later persuaded to postpone the release to December. The delay, however, caused many problems in the distribution of the game;[3][2] because it would take longer for the product to reach consumers' hands, the game's publisher planned to charge higher retail prices. As a result, Zilch Entertainment decided to reduce the price of the title from $49 to $11. When Nintendo responded by putting the game on its holiday gift list for 1983 in early December, Zilch decided to cancel the game's distribution altogether.[1]\n\nWhen it was first released in December 1982, the game was a huge failure. According to industry trade papers, sales were so poor that the game was being unsold in major markets like Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, which placed a large stack of unsold cartridges in each of its 5,000-plus stores. In December 1983, NES Vice President Jim Balsillie told the developers of LucasArts' adventure gameThe Dig what happened with Zilch Entertainment's offering: \"It was terrible,\" he reminisced, \"and I just wanted to tell you it's a real pity because they were a very nice, nice, nice group of people--the people who made [Zilch's] game.\" Zilch did not make a profit from The Dig, so the NES-version of Zilch's next title for Nintendo, Red Baron, was placed on the back burner.[1]\n\nNES versions of Zilch's game were very rare in the marketplace; it was extremely difficult to find one at retail. Some of the few copies of the game in existence are believed to have been destroyed through poor storage practices or by children who wanted to play the game and had little understanding of its potential for value.","token_len":621,"entropy":[7.8278,2.6642,8.5149,4.2712,1.6193,7.288,1.0806,5.2196,7.6694,2.6484,1.0561,0.2173,2.9261,0.8003,8.2478,1.9128,0.4754,3.6553,8.1149,6.2378,4.4375,4.1657,4.2308,0.9121,2.8869,8.3933,2.187,2.669,0.3577,11.3616,4.1677,6.0648,1.3216,6.6818,8.9769,2.9399,7.9928,4.4453,3.9571,5.8233,0.307,2.9877,2.1072,3.1035,1.7187,4.4976,0.0007,1.0359,0.372,0.0007,6.9396,3.6864,2.7454,4.8467,2.0135,4.7906,2.9045,4.0881,2.6101,5.4352,0.0161,5.7806,3.6012,8.1657,4.0635,1.0436,2.3319,2.774,2.0478,3.1381,2.8103,0.0434,3.9651,5.3563,0.9837,0.4747,0.0013,0.5958,2.6868,2.2585,2.694,5.2192,0.2198,4.3831,0.9875,4.4385,2.5092,0.8143,4.4885,5.6983,4.2002,9.8207,0.0503,3.4209,2.6079,4.8934,1.6307,0.2416,0.7878,4.87,2.4998,0.0703,4.4133,5.3936,6.7888,1.6881,3.053,1.5225,3.4664,7.0749,2.8318,0.0953,0.3955,0.0003,2.0246,8.2734,3.312,3.6841,2.6337,5.456,3.7686,0.5488,2.6505,4.835,0.001,0.9898,6.9964,2.5671,0.517,3.3932,5.2158,1.4602,5.0744,1.1258,3.9598,4.5272,0.6198,1.2978,4.8921,1.6808,0.1843,6.8787,0.9375,4.0913,0.089,8.456,1.2592,2.7257,1.9821,0.6954,0.0007,7.292,3.4758,4.2317,4.8549,4.0337,1.0493,2.934,0.0418,1.7874,3.7437,7.1695,0.735,2.9314,4.9278,4.1986,0.3429,3.1241,1.0039,1.7069,1.5379,3.7061,2.6002,1.1399,2.095,6.6487,4.357,3.8214,2.9047,0.3418,3.9502,4.8576,1.5388,2.1009,0.0053,4.24,3.9697,2.8564,1.1076,1.2956,3.9516,3.6371,4.2626,1.4342,0.2817,2.7948,0.9336,5.946,3.5918,1.018,1.6425,4.65,0.9052,1.7712,2.4571,3.3035,1.0591,3.3149,0.0707,1.4456,3.8793,0.0038,3.5344,5.1912,4.0096,1.5637,4.9021,1.5251,1.6025,6.2442,0.5488,2.1827,5.3528,0.1827,2.9737,4.3208,2.6278,3.7041,2.061,0.9355,4.4998,9.5379,2.6019,1.7215,4.3487,1.9239,2.9791,0.3294,0.1221,0.5529,0.0001,1.7473,2.1513,1.1492,3.2544,2.3825,0.369,0.4766,2.9643,1.3493,4.3058,3.4325,3.4155,2.6575,3.6344,0.3639,2.8923,5.8503,4.3275,0.4152,1.8871,1.0989,0.5863,2.4611,2.3687,3.1415,1.5082,5.502,3.8435,1.0012,0.0034,2.8215,3.0373,1.8269,2.7497,0.5121,6.5377,0.4727,0.1847,0.2388,4.7677,7.9835,2.4669,2.1042,4.2586,0.2137,4.5063,2.0786,3.2131,3.1458,4.0102,1.5641,0.6983,6.4347,0.1605,1.8483,3.8134,5.7513,1.9068,0.4822,1.495,1.4373,2.3543,3.4451,7.6449,0.2734,4.3127,4.2055,5.0537,0.2159,2.212,3.8801,0.3689,0.0468,0.1234,6.8337,10.1537,2.2625,5.8886,2.8152,0.1444,5.9174,0.4191,1.2425,0.4689,0.1249,4.7311,2.2832,0.293,4.7716,1.3517,0.0824,4.4926,1.1335,6.0463,6.1897,6.8218,1.2229,5.0769,0.8487,0.7012,0.6294,3.1985,6.8939,6.1532,2.1927,3.1502,5.7429,5.0567,4.1383,5.3985,0.2397,2.2661,0.0083,0.0024,4.0218,0.2233,2.7494,0.2503,1.3602,1.9809,4.5288,5.361,1.055,2.6463,0.17,0.4434,0.0001,4.6375,3.2519,0.7187,4.5595,0.5817,1.334,3.5524,2.8408,0.1354,0.7254,0.4453,1.1231,2.9851,4.0129,7.4641,1.1211,4.4974,0.001,6.3876,5.6591,3.5204,0.3408,4.2672,1.7775,4.1456,2.8931,0.2315,1.6314,1.3306,1.0126,6.1659,8.4346,1.3762,1.9804,3.9516,2.5641,3.5995,11.0984,15.0159,8.1341,5.5927,6.8294,6.7575,8.8774,1.2236,2.9969,5.9721,1.6212,3.0816,11.834,0.19,4.7206,0.0478,3.6444,1.1246,5.4188,1.5382,1.1542,6.8743,1.289,0.304,2.8383,2.1847,0.4782,0.7985,3.0301,4.3963,1.0176,0.1252,7.2079,8.2558,0.1289,4.7586,5.0511,3.2891,1.114,0.0383,2.946,1.6194,6.6248,2.3348,2.7611,2.2318,0.0003,3.8743,6.6218,0.4904,9.9693,8.6503,9.5844,2.8779,4.3479,2.6134,0.0174,0.0034,2.1284,1.6558,8.8237,1.9682,0.5927,3.0307,1.0368,5.4521,4.4118,0.9138,8.5836,0.009,1.9101,0.4108,1.7989,2.145,4.0285,3.2185,0.4652,3.6237,0.6867,4.0081,2.6817,2.3513,4.1464,5.5509,3.5014,3.4109,2.8605,4.6837,3.4033,3.925,4.3487,2.8193,3.3252,1.4735,5.9041,0.7198,0.4881,7.6444,3.6292,2.7484,0.5572,2.2114,4.9388,2.3229,0.0196,0.0014,1.6729,0.15,1.4856,1.7014,4.0209,0.0049,0.0044,4.3324,0.3675,3.0394,1.9506,1.307,1.7113,4.9727,0.2502,1.241,4.0468,1.2206,5.0473,5.1457,3.1358,0.8437,2.3114,0.0089,0.0021,2.6152,7.2024,3.4277,6.276,4.0655,2.8461,7.0757,7.8745,0.6532,0.6016,6.9901,0.2979,0.7536,2.515,2.4514,2.1726,1.1698,0.0772,0.2319,0.0001,7.1731,4.8597,0.5628,0.9849,0.0074,0.0036,1.4798,2.771,1.4032,5.4044,4.595,2.3663,0.8075,5.7643,3.6376,3.4186,0.5054,6.567,1.4726,0.2237,1.1467,3.6111,4.1599,3.1199,1.1328,4.4914,1.8071,0.3266,4.8633,4.1457,1.2689,0.7477,0.3126,3.61,3.8333,4.0241,3.9051,0.0317,0.5884,0.6311,4.3953,6.3647,4.7063,3.8776,2.9721,3.035,3.0814,7.5223,2.7112,4.5279,0.3202,1.3527,1.4065,0.157,4.0621,3.2021,2.9061,4.6602,0.1226,2.2303,7.3543,1.7736,6.9702,0.6375]}
{"id":224,"ended":false,"length":600,"text":"In mid @ - @ 2009, producers decided to take Nicole's storyline into a `` u @ - @ turn ``, when she reverted to her `` wild ways ``.

With all those male actors around, Nicole would be at risk of falling victim to `` co _ _ _ _ a m _ * _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -- _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ oratory `` (just like her character, Alexis). They decided that her long-lost biological mother, who had remained in the dark about her daughter's existence, could be her savior as well. Nicole's newfound mother revealed their true nature as half-vampires. At the same time, Nicole learned that she might have a son... whose existence was kept from her. Nicole decided to accept Sam for who he was. But would this turn her towards Tom?\n\nSince that time, both Tom (David Canary) and Sammy (Eddy Williams) have departed the show--but Nicole didn''t take the news too hard. Instead, she decided it was too soon for her to have a serious boyfriend. She did, however, start dating a co-star named Sam Carter. When the show decided to give Sam Carter a spinoff on which his wife (played by Melanie Chartoff), a pregnant Nicole, and Sam Carter''s son (portrayed by Jason Hervey) could all appear, Nicole decided to call it quits. She broke up with Sam. Now, what's a girl to do?\n\n\"I''m actually really, really pleased that he came on board,\" she said. \"It''s such an organic relationship at this point, and a lot of people seem to really like it. [It made sense story-wise.] They didn''t just bring a guy in to be a love interest or a sidekick. The guys have really helped me grow as an actress, and I''m really proud of that.

{"id":4565,"ended":true,"length":540,"text":"To supervise the construction of the pipeline, Alyeska appointed two construction management contractors to oversee all the other subcontractors in the project. Bechtel Corporation, from San Francisco, was named the management contractor. Bechtel is one of the largest construction management contractors in the world. The company has a large fleet of skilled workers, a large number of subcontractor-owned subcontracts.\n\nIn 2006, Alyeska decided to give an annual Christmas bonus to its employees. The total bonus for the 1,250 employees was $7 million, the average employee received $6,500 annually.\n\nEmployment\n\nAlyeska hired more than 1,700 workers to work on the pipeline in 2006. One hundred of these workers were permanent, the average annual salary was $40,000. Of all those working for Alyeska, 1,500 were Alyeska employees.\n\nConstruction\n\nIn 2006, the pipeline ran through more than 7,500 miles of state, federal and private land in Alaska, including through a large area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The construction of the pipeline was conducted by Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, a privately owned subsidiary of oil giant, Alyeska. The $7 billion pipeline was the second-largest project ever to be undertaken by Alyeska. The pipeline went into service in 2011.\n\nIn addition to oil, the gas pipeline would pipe about 3.3 billion cubic feet of gas per day into gas-rich states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. The pipeline was also designed to transfer other types of natural gas, including liquefied natural gas and natural-gas liquids (such as ethane and propane). The pipeline is also designed to carry hydrogen from Canada and Alaska to the United States\n\nEnvironmental Concerns\n\nThe first step in the drilling operation was to construct a pipeline through virgin oil and gas fields in the North Slope of Alaska. After the pipeline was completed, construction was conducted of the drill support for the pipeline. The drill support included a mobile drilling rig that could be constructed near the pipeline site. The mobile drilling rig could later be moved to another site.\n\nAlyeska Pipeline Service Company obtained a special permit from the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 which would allow it to drill within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Alyeska was required to file a Final Environmental Impact Statement on March 28, 2006.\n\nThe Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission determined that an offshore test well could be conducted in waters that are within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The first phase of the offshore test drilling was completed on June 15, 2008, with a dry hole. In the dry hole, the test well did not penetrate the permafrost deposit. The Commission had issued a ruling requiring the companies to establish two more test wells. Although the dry-hole drilling did not establish an offshore oil well, it allowed the companies to conduct other studies in this region of the refuge and to examine the impact of oil spills caused by test drilling.","token_len":622,"entropy":[12.045,0.003,1.6566,5.2166,0.3819,1.3419,5.8327,0.7619,12.0135,4.5906,2.3004,9.4295,3.8996,5.3965,5.9514,6.9993,1.1851,1.559,4.1139,1.9155,5.2415,7.1807,0.3616,3.5243,0.2411,1.1399,0.599,9.2353,3.5493,0.0552,7.1978,1.2413,6.7316,5.7924,1.0922,0.2127,1.9802,5.5581,1.3564,7.1025,0.2206,1.3517,3.1877,0.0002,0.0012,3.3115,2.5222,0.0085,0.7002,1.0181,2.9291,4.1665,1.6572,0.154,0.2453,1.1918,0.7256,2.4499,0.9412,1.7331,2.5061,3.8097,4.2344,0.0576,8.1957,1.7005,1.872,4.5451,2.4269,2.9643,0.0029,2.4018,4.2466,4.144,1.8458,4.9892,7.1296,5.933,1.8719,0.0008,2.7488,4.4425,0.2093,3.3438,0.0078,0.0027,5.0263,0.1964,5.2662,4.8201,3.9633,8.8315,2.6802,0.4887,1.8853,2.4698,1.0945,1.3988,5.6285,1.5072,2.9708,1.1625,6.7117,0.4582,4.7155,0.9293,0.9684,0.3027,4.128,3.1124,1.4544,3.6581,5.1714,5.3761,4.4525,2.2731,3.3265,0.9771,2.4268,3.9266,0.4598,1.6524,0.0002,5.3501,3.2407,2.6975,0.0002,3.1492,0.1643,0.0076,0.004,4.3634,3.4731,0.0615,2.3275,0.0095,3.35,2.3897,2.3552,2.1909,0.6654,0.4774,1.5794,2.2201,2.1449,0.5408,5.0173,4.1669,2.1582,1.1682,0.8179,1.2599,6.2989,3.4609,4.5234,4.3497,3.1518,0.9248,0.6062,0.0987,4.4428,0.0331,0.3948,0.49,4.4685,5.4193,3.6438,3.781,2.7353,0.7092,0.0111,0.0021,0.2577,4.456,0.0196,3.5195,0.8048,14.1176,0.0065,0.005,1.2102,0.6585,0.823,0.0002,5.3494,1.6296,0.0001,2.5032,1.2739,0.1232,1.4124,1.5703,5.409,1.6509,4.8959,0.0224,4.4535,0.3095,1.7873,2.6997,0.0912,5.9609,3.5569,0.7776,0.9025,3.3006,0.86,2.4689,3.3818,1.3011,2.8468,6.8828,3.1694,4.322,3.2052,0.7531,1.4523,3.1278,2.8826,0.0583,0.0014,0.9423,1.2366,5.0095,0.9461,0.0763,0.2948,1.6203,4.227,1.3811,2.7773,0.0093,0.0056,4.5045,5.5839,3.2169,0.9265,1.7664,5.3563,0.7037,1.9053,0.0472,6.6154,3.1236,5.8058,8.5579,0.0252,0.0088,2.7266,1.4999,6.3556,3.0124,3.3264,1.6349,2.0724,2.9445,3.0549,1.7156,0.231,2.0089,2.6315,2.7932,0.7166,4.6687,0.7316,2.3279,0.0112,0.0072,1.0327,1.6978,1.5168,6.0515,2.4751,0.867,0.3126,3.9328,0.7284,0.4273,0.0002,2.4274,3.2523,0.2478,4.4582,1.7907,1.3164,7.0015,3.2127,4.4797,7.7591,4.5156,3.4658,1.5394,2.3373,2.751,0.2132,0.1788,0.0912,2.3142,1.5353,0.2695,1.6792,7.9112,0.9037,0.9016,6.1792,2.3986,0.0071,3.6266,0.3923,1.3874,0.6788,2.6126,3.0944,0.009,0.3431,1.2074,1.1096,2.7892,3.1309,3.4785,0.2278,5.8765,7.7005,3.3981,0.0015,1.3435,0.012,1.6652,1.3406,4.4114,0.0301,0.0027,0.0829,0.0021,2.4717,1.8431,4.0829,0.0038,0.7254,3.6857,4.9282,0.0016,4.0476,0.0284,1.5401,1.3518,0.0029,0.8256,1.6634,0.7928,3.0391,2.8414,2.5322,0.0962,2.2825,8.047,2.9989,3.782,2.2107,5.0697,0.5876,1.4317,1.2916,0.0071,8.1253,0.0002,4.1094,4.5275,0.0601,0.0874,0.0001,1.4615,5.4803,3.7828,0.5336,0.7531,5.7356,3.4831,1.1807,0.7775,5.2949,0.8644,2.792,3.782,8.2464,3.7484,1.3198,0.7814,1.6935,1.3552,1.3936,3.9767,3.1649,0.001,0.9984,1.1729,0.6544,4.9716,1.8567,1.4928,0.7517,0.6101,0.2801,4.734,2.1513,4.5442,5.7955,1.5609,7.0795,9.7084,4.8035,0.2717,0.7588,0.8368,1.3317,2.5872,0.8012,4.163,1.892,8.0426,3.6705,1.0068,1.7398,2.252,1.702,8.038,5.5945,0.5398,2.1526,2.5733,1.0545,1.1131,3.8093,1.29,0.0222,2.545,7.5675,0.1758,2.8489,0.7115,2.2201,1.2481,1.9119,1.1789,0.0002,2.9255,1.5806,0.0052,0.01,3.4751,1.1536,0.2394,7.0732,1.3549,4.8654,0.2493,0.9364,0.1148,2.9415,4.6483,3.7752,0.646,0.1375,3.6053,2.0836,1.0361,4.3602,4.9273,0.7619,1.3856,0.0521,1.2964,4.6556,1.2934,4.1865,0.4224,0.0079,0.0022,0.9531,3.472,0.0259,0.0121,2.4341,1.6272,0.0918,5.2872,0.7045,7.6816,0.9686,0.158,0.0863,3.1607,6.9538,3.5587,0.0393,2.0546,1.1279,1.549,0.0002,1.7982,4.4761,2.7924,0.2276,0.0092,1.7765,0.765,4.9886,0.362,4.9827,5.0034,7.2647,3.4782,2.5876,1.0731,4.6367,2.3267,6.7282,2.783,1.7506,2.8661,0.9577,2.6949,0.163,0.0118,0.0023,0.981,0.9337,5.0994,3.3449,0.0593,0.3917,2.6549,1.0834,3.1587,1.0661,2.1987,0.8642,2.2703,3.2963,0.0291,3.1272,1.9818,2.5166,1.7883,7.3616,5.6045,6.6956,3.345,1.3608,2.77,0.249,0.3309,1.047,4.5739,1.8457,6.1292,0.1046,3.8906,0.9413,5.6611,0.0001,0.0001,8.4331,1.8068,1.1277,9.2248,4.9509,4.8226,0.7392,6.1096,3.4904,1.0617,6.4687,0.2037,5.2108,5.6758,4.4162,2.5776,0.0834,2.2578,6.1664,0.5546,4.9491,5.6427,0.272,1.8968,3.4657,0.1118,6.4197,2.6778,1.5516,3.9544,1.6186,0.2299,1.4453,3.4119,0.8049,0.5421,0.0775,2.8674,4.8186,4.8529,3.0491,5.5516,2.8976,2.9595,0.162,5.6671,2.8584,2.5652,4.3305,1.0746,2.7369,0.2372,4.0416,3.5591,7.3434,0.0297,9.6862,2.1794,0.7864]}
{"id":4604,"ended":true,"length":560,"text":"In Greece, I Corps was employed as such for the first time. The campaign was another short one, but very trying on the participants. Just three days after headquarters opened on May 12, the French began to attack south of Elvanon (modern-day Filippoi), hoping to get a good position before winter. This was in direct contravention of the orders of General de la Barre (Commander-in-Chief of IV Corps ). General de la Barre had issued a specific order on May 9, in which he clearly specified that II Corps and XVIII Corps would attack on the night of May 3 - 4. On May 11, the German General Command informed the French by telegraph of their plans. General de la Barre and his staff ignored the previous orders to attack to the south, and instead sent three divisions out on the left : II Corps with Division P\u00e9lissier, the 2nd Division of the 7th Army, and the 2nd and 3rd Squadrons of the 14th Cavalry division south of Elvanon. The I Division of XVIII Corps followed shortly with the 2nd Cavalry, 2nd Reserve Division of XVII Corps and the 6th Division. At the same time, French commandos advanced to the left of the First Army. The attack went forward despite the weather conditions which made the advance difficult. By daybreak of May 13, the French First Army occupied the Greek villages of Monastery (modern-day Kalavryta) and Sesenio, just north of Lake Karadjuri. The weather improved during May, but on May 16 both II Corps (with the 14th Division) and XVIII Corps (with the 2nd Cavalry Division) were caught between heavy rain rain and the German left. On May 15, the first German tanks made their appearance. The French forces were weakened by a lack of reserve as well as by the presence of the commandos, but the enemy was not well protected either. The situation remained difficult all day. The German General Command again informed the French by telegraph of their attack plans. The French commander rejected the plans and instead organized the defense. In the afternoon, three of the infantry divisions of II Corps moved to the left while the commandos crossed the Lake and the 3rd Infantry Division prepared for the possible attack on the east. Although the commandos were able to prevent an immediate German attack, they failed to cover the retreat by the infantry divisions. In the afternoon of May 17, after almost a month of fighting, the French advanced to Karadjuri Beach. By the night of May 18, the French First Army was established at Karadjuri. In the next few days, the allies started to send supplies forward along the coast. The French army continued to move from the mountains back to Athens.\nBy now, the French had suffered an overall loss of 2,500 men killed, wounded or captured. The Germans had inflicted an equal number of losses and had even captured 700 of the Greek civilians, who served as forced laborers in the German army.","token_len":623,"entropy":[10.0989,0.5741,4.9802,15.5394,3.5907,6.6224,2.1428,8.483,2.454,2.0853,2.5215,0.464,2.0569,2.3929,8.007,1.2279,8.2085,6.8193,1.3754,1.1909,1.6468,6.0598,11.0909,5.0216,1.2466,8.0086,0.6822,7.3128,5.0447,2.1777,1.319,9.9717,3.8423,3.4285,2.9784,3.6004,0.5608,2.6431,5.5458,5.4358,1.6784,3.1032,7.5037,0.6753,7.4459,6.8965,6.8418,4.1016,6.3345,1.8353,0.0231,6.0246,5.1716,7.9362,1.5726,7.1759,0.2823,3.6252,2.1942,4.5644,3.8288,4.3381,6.3333,2.0912,3.6459,1.3131,4.6976,4.7297,3.0344,0.0055,0.1056,0.7474,4.7355,0.8321,2.943,3.8688,3.5285,6.2403,2.1933,2.7687,7.9508,0.2265,1.1566,0.2462,0.0013,0.0337,0.3385,10.2875,0.4933,7.8349,4.5212,0.4421,0.1615,0.166,0.0015,1.961,4.8997,1.203,7.1548,0.7306,3.3702,0.8902,3.3799,1.0673,3.9717,0.9481,0.4965,7.4629,5.8431,0.6038,9.6606,0.0095,3.5176,6.1424,3.0813,0.0607,0.9842,2.558,3.0613,1.505,3.5255,0.1474,0.4701,4.9021,5.4472,1.7091,1.2839,2.9776,0.7268,2.3209,0.4941,1.696,4.5286,4.7683,3.9935,5.7492,1.1116,1.9445,6.2163,3.8083,1.426,2.4149,2.3288,2.4024,1.392,3.3388,0.1266,0.0719,0.0126,0.0006,3.8623,1.3261,2.4927,7.4287,1.0227,8.408,0.3688,4.1362,0.7364,5.7185,0.9913,1.2911,2.0265,1.4078,2.4995,3.6299,4.8421,2.7188,4.2065,2.7843,0.7821,5.9906,10.6911,4.972,0.0164,6.208,6.8908,5.3044,4.8796,2.0413,3.8966,1.924,1.1318,4.2967,4.2242,0.4187,2.1139,3.0141,1.6335,4.2158,0.0659,2.9137,0.8183,0.6108,0.8167,1.9269,0.2293,3.6966,0.7665,0.0562,8.4657,0.0328,0.9819,0.8107,4.7844,0.0094,4.0959,0.0011,5.506,8.5107,0.2615,1.696,0.0406,0.0352,0.5739,1.5545,6.2238,9.2207,2.7251,4.1203,0.3916,0.0172,4.656,5.2031,5.9958,1.7136,2.7314,0.0736,3.7289,0.0002,2.6689,4.2685,0.0886,6.6985,2.126,2.4405,3.988,3.3493,0.0312,1.6276,0.8116,4.242,0.0104,2.767,2.5118,3.9786,1.5487,0.6985,0.0257,0.5014,5.4549,4.6309,2.6238,5.4386,1.9135,0.5943,3.5534,0.8282,0.3916,6.9969,3.6522,2.6317,1.5639,4.2361,4.9429,4.7157,5.9336,0.8363,6.5923,1.5786,4.3924,3.1853,1.6314,3.198,0.8902,0.4605,3.8479,5.3009,0.4925,4.1547,0.6314,2.0824,0.3161,1.0373,1.1823,8.3159,0.4815,6.4723,0.9453,6.7826,4.1031,0.431,6.3193,4.1117,3.0343,3.1795,0.3223,0.0026,7.0069,4.5864,6.9631,5.2252,1.2864,0.3113,4.481,4.4001,5.7466,5.2033,2.2777,4.9703,2.0012,0.0303,7.1393,6.3788,6.2637,6.2843,0.7572,1.4909,6.7069,5.1629,4.5759,4.3827,2.5817,1.7293,3.0827,0.708,2.3111,6.7797,5.7083,0.0315,4.5696,4.2114,2.0427,4.9579,0.0034,2.8916,0.4877,0.0384,1.0722,0.1577,0.002,0.8772,0.1292,0.3602,1.7393,0.0098,1.1348,0.0003,3.3806,0.0556,1.4599,5.8366,2.9134,3.4723,2.0565,8.7529,0.5981,2.634,4.5822,6.8618,1.942,1.9849,0.5651,4.4011,0.4606,1.0399,3.8824,2.1693,4.2919,4.4803,0.9014,4.0722,2.2628,1.4561,3.0386,4.6101,1.8275,7.3455,1.2462,3.2456,3.8355,0.0045,6.0669,5.865,0.6431,0.047,1.2818,1.1159,3.9528,0.0159,1.876,8.2377,0.2897,3.0353,1.7549,1.526,4.454,2.7334,2.5866,5.6915,3.5187,5.4201,0.2146,1.7461,4.1969,3.6285,4.208,5.746,1.4901,1.4526,1.9841,2.9358,3.5559,0.2157,5.7552,2.9028,0.3654,0.3227,1.4644,0.0512,0.0198,1.0243,0.5151,4.778,2.6845,0.9065,1.9748,1.9079,4.1015,7.9616,0.79,4.6508,1.8682,3.5868,7.8119,2.0437,5.7733,3.2038,3.29,1.3188,2.821,1.1718,5.4351,4.2914,0.425,5.4763,0.7826,1.549,2.6862,0.0044,4.1434,1.7995,0.3817,1.3756,6.5857,0.5875,5.3441,0.213,6.2623,0.4607,5.4906,6.7973,2.7023,3.9928,0.087,2.5281,0.4867,7.6497,1.4197,1.228,6.6999,0.7869,1.9205,0.3245,3.9599,0.633,5.2419,0.7304,4.3853,0.187,1.4286,3.1526,0.0046,5.102,3.532,4.2149,2.3853,0.7724,0.5824,1.6602,3.5685,0.1506,5.795,0.6963,3.8009,3.8339,1.8731,5.8166,2.3006,0.9716,3.1496,0.5889,1.7244,2.5646,0.1787,1.59,0.1978,4.4364,6.1438,1.7504,1.0653,0.3327,1.4342,0.2962,0.5946,1.6878,4.882,0.8593,4.9785,0.053,0.0127,10.3462,1.4044,3.9847,1.2548,3.7424,0.5023,0.1509,0.5511,0.2217,0.7655,1.396,5.3383,0.0258,1.5349,6.4769,2.4343,2.5086,0.0266,0.004,1.5834,3.0756,0.8356,3.8792,1.3091,0.1816,0.5129,0.8287,7.79,5.1804,0.671,5.238,4.8555,6.7779,4.8723,0.3217,2.802,1.3216,1.9182,2.084,4.6205,3.5135,0.4745,3.4598,4.1518,1.2629,4.9056,6.824,0.5688,5.0822,1.0565,4.3586,5.8271,4.5727,0.8109,0.877,2.2033,1.7578,5.7987,3.8917,5.2794,2.18,0.386,4.4842,0.1373,2.0159,0.6965,7.2451,1.6216,1.6978,2.7529,0.2863,1.025,1.4359,2.9626,1.1635,5.407,3.5638,4.5386,2.1847,0.3689,0.9641,2.841,3.6412,5.8401,4.4065,8.5349,2.2964,0.5131,3.9012,5.1037,2.9224,3.2774,7.8068,1.1407,7.4651,0.5736,2.2387,0.434,4.4399,2.1693,0.4536]}
{"id":259,"ended":true,"length":558,"text":"The Port of Galveston, also called Galveston Wharves, began as a trading post in 1825. Today, the port has grown to 850 acres ( 3 @. @ 4 km2 ) in size [ 9 ] and sees about 25.5 million vehicles a year -- including 11,800 cruise liners, 4,300 pleasure craft, and 606,000 cruise ship passengers [ 31 ] [ 32 ] -- [ 1 ] along with hundreds of commercial vessels daily [ 3 ] bringing in goods to Galveston and exporting everything from cotton, rice, and oil [ 20 ] to iron, petroleum, corn and corn syrup [ 5 ] and sugar [ 14 ] [ 31 ] [ 22 ]. [ 14 ] To keep pace with this traffic, the port has also dredged. 7 kilometres of channel to allow larger ships to dock [ 35 ], [ 16 ] and its cargo terminals have been expanded with new piers to allow larger container ships to moor [ 7 ] and unload [ 2 ] and bulk shipments [ 33 ]. These improvements have made the port a more active player in the local economy [ 29 ] [ 33 ] with a direct employment of 21,000 workers and an annual contribution to the gross domestic product of $ 2.5 billion [ 16 ]\n\nGalveston Wharves, the first major port built along the Texas Coast in the late 1800s, was located in the eastern half of the city. Due to the lack of a levee system, the area was home to approximately one hundred cottages, mostly clustered within five blocks north of the port [ 6 ]. Because of this lack of levee and natural-level land between the port and the sea, the Wharves would often flood during Hurricane Ike. [ 9 ] The first major hurricane to hit Galveston in 1903 also struck at the city\u2019s eastern entrance to the port. In a study conducted after the storm [ 10 ], the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determined that the \u201cprobable cause of the major damage\u201d to the eastern Wharves was the lack of any levee system to protect it against high winds and ocean surges. The storm surge from this storm reached 1.4 kilometres above mean sea level, flooding the port and the homes of several thousand people in the area. Due to these major damages, the Army Corps of Engineers immediately began drafting plans for a levee system to protect the city\u2019s downtown. After a year long study, the federal government made a decision after Hurricane Ike, and approved a 13-kilometre levee system to be built across the lower end of central Galveston for $1.1 billion. In the long run, the move would prove to be beneficial for the city, making it far less likely to suffer from future storms. The project began construction in 2006 and the levees were completed in August 2010 [ 11 ]. However, the storm surge from the next year\u2019s Hurricane Ike would still overtop the levee and cause almost three billion dollars in damage [ 12 ].","token_len":623,"entropy":[9.6456,1.775,8.672,0.5842,0.0005,1.619,6.3459,3.3119,4.4082,0.0261,0.0097,9.3955,4.8986,0.3333,0.3891,5.6682,2.6459,0.2642,5.575,0.8134,1.3879,1.3193,4.3068,0.7479,3.6578,0.5635,1.1878,2.0297,2.658,3.5424,0.9875,8.2529,2.932,3.2246,10.3882,13.3764,6.9926,5.9978,6.2658,5.1051,3.0039,1.2061,3.9441,2.3355,8.8786,4.9621,2.0267,0.7682,9.4548,2.6276,4.3102,5.5824,1.5914,0.1953,5.016,1.9586,0.4885,7.603,4.42,5.7316,1.7311,3.716,5.3835,3.622,0.002,1.7937,3.7983,0.2111,2.9552,9.8645,4.9509,0.6371,1.1283,6.0289,7.8289,2.7029,0.198,5.6799,2.4676,2.2112,1.3592,9.4438,2.0733,2.3366,0.3826,1.0895,4.3491,4.8484,7.2461,0.1529,6.6514,0.4108,4.9769,0.0394,3.7725,2.4973,6.8793,2.245,1.9228,0.2606,7.4292,1.8753,4.8273,2.2962,3.3949,0.0016,0.0039,2.0088,6.6572,7.0244,0.2866,5.2272,2.605,4.3088,0.2762,1.5463,4.8311,2.1578,6.4761,0.1643,0.5706,5.9248,2.08,4.6767,0.1782,7.0283,2.6053,5.3479,1.9195,0.5168,4.1323,0.0662,2.1625,4.7719,1.0826,3.6936,0.071,0.7949,4.0307,0.086,0.7097,4.7787,3.495,3.1207,4.3076,0.0371,6.3031,4.0912,4.0051,0.0686,3.5347,5.5001,0.4376,1.0736,1.4923,1.702,2.9334,9.578,0.0062,7.8316,9.8357,8.1252,1.3221,4.6899,4.3846,4.9106,6.739,1.8168,0.3851,3.2574,2.7212,4.5601,3.9809,2.808,4.559,0.1501,0.7584,5.6705,4.5935,3.9714,2.439,0.5382,2.8121,3.8773,2.4709,7.436,0.036,2.5298,2.0686,2.8139,5.104,0.3614,0.5594,8.2167,0.0405,2.2918,4.4325,0.1816,0.9172,6.8819,0.0721,1.405,4.4496,0.1934,3.1491,7.5104,5.5547,0.7876,4.8467,1.4152,5.3263,3.6987,1.174,2.6156,0.8928,0.4282,1.6875,2.0869,4.8668,5.3116,0.2723,0.47,3.7475,0.8624,1.7757,4.5289,0.518,1.28,3.1695,0.3578,4.1864,2.6852,5.6431,6.7438,2.8426,6.3157,1.8567,0.6372,3.149,2.0519,2.2319,2.0125,5.6519,2.0692,0.8638,6.7237,0.6624,0.0014,0.5639,1.0133,5.1259,0.624,2.6577,0.3525,0.5863,4.5569,0.3443,5.6363,0.001,2.6754,0.0018,0.0085,2.005,0.0159,0.0009,2.4653,2.5777,3.1458,3.1069,1.5439,3.9623,4.9695,0.3232,2.4358,3.6364,1.9977,1.5731,2.848,1.1109,0.1388,0.2264,1.2048,3.6161,1.6458,0.8831,4.4395,3.0248,0.0059,0.5688,3.0283,2.0626,5.5752,0.0493,1.1605,4.2864,0.0017,2.1973,7.1486,0.0156,2.2569,0.9857,1.2411,4.0265,0.8912,5.2908,0.0103,5.1095,3.7933,3.3173,6.892,3.0595,0.0014,1.4009,5.193,6.7882,3.3782,4.7319,3.678,5.6661,0.2167,0.5429,3.0583,1.5147,3.5173,0.7048,5.2135,0.5434,1.9208,3.6776,0.0641,1.5263,0.1465,5.011,5.3378,4.6223,7.6805,4.8945,7.0693,0.5823,2.7066,0.1125,0.8462,4.6797,0.2181,1.2326,4.8131,0.0741,0.003,5.3286,2.8218,3.634,3.0766,6.7096,4.5739,2.2403,2.5991,2.9517,0.0812,1.9921,4.3113,2.9347,4.4613,0.713,0.4625,0.5058,0.0004,0.0022,0.6021,6.2878,4.5447,3.389,4.1857,0.8417,4.4794,15.8247,6.7259,5.6012,3.8268,4.8982,1.7681,0.5742,2.6253,1.9694,2.8077,3.6038,7.1252,2.2577,4.8958,0.6859,2.496,4.4645,2.4115,0.7005,1.5863,3.2457,0.0225,0.0195,0.0111,1.908,0.251,0.0157,0.0005,2.3994,0.1655,0.9457,14.4037,7.3873,9.7055,1.4801,1.3136,3.4916,0.3482,5.9751,4.2688,0.8569,7.6364,3.028,0.5687,5.3766,5.2434,0.0185,0.0025,1.3466,1.4371,2.3003,0.0015,4.9446,1.1993,0.0446,1.3732,4.0992,1.5747,3.1936,2.5749,6.4328,1.2058,1.4002,6.007,5.3777,0.895,2.0835,4.5018,4.9768,3.4287,2.9505,0.6947,6.7628,4.1062,1.0618,2.6342,4.0896,4.5501,9.8249,0.8742,0.0284,2.1404,7.2186,1.1425,2.6055,1.7814,2.9327,8.3346,0.3739,4.1359,2.2371,1.0054,3.2581,0.9979,1.2688,0.7128,5.2831,0.0037,3.5945,5.3228,2.9243,0.2438,0.7994,7.6265,0.0618,0.86,0.0005,6.7173,1.8915,6.2209,2.1362,0.7964,1.4024,2.4079,0.0065,0.4104,1.8844,0.7209,0.4827,1.375,4.9266,0.1768,0.028,5.5992,1.4749,5.1399,2.7598,3.9622,7.2584,1.6224,0.5126,0.3901,5.032,0.2422,5.4115,1.8121,0.8632,6.038,3.3467,1.7463,2.9981,2.6122,4.6904,1.4331,7.075,0.9029,2.0761,0.1374,0.0054,2.0461,0.0037,0.5733,2.1958,3.0077,0.4631,4.3867,0.3289,7.0683,5.0328,0.0318,7.8039,0.4026,0.0013,0.0024,5.0248,3.9667,3.6361,0.4477,2.9267,0.1607,1.4055,3.3413,2.36,6.3064,0.8288,0.0626,0.7805,7.9132,2.422,5.8795,0.8551,0.0488,4.874,1.2288,0.8934,1.017,2.054,5.2763,0.8179,6.5848,2.0076,1.2162,1.4134,2.7302,2.7622,4.255,1.8623,0.6883,2.4583,3.6515,4.2509,2.5548,0.433,4.2484,1.2888,3.6045,5.4546,2.7271,1.1993,1.8254,0.3553,3.6892,2.4205,2.0929,0.9564,0.7677,4.5775,0.0111,1.4942,6.0501,1.5166,1.5861,0.8427,6.5464,4.4621,6.9134,0.3654,0.0569,2.9571,1.5927,3.8486,3.1492,8.3128,6.922,0.6588,3.0848,0.3818,2.7153,2.2452,7.1595,4.3747,4.4703,0.1954,0.9937,0.2331,2.1036,1.2571,0.3933]}
{"id":1648,"ended":true,"length":529,"text":"In the 1950s, the New Zealand Wildlife Service was established and began making regular expeditions to search for the kakapo, mostly in Fiordland and what is now the < unk > National Park. The kakapo is one of New Zealand's most endangered species, and in 1950, the last two known kakapo eggs were collected from an abandoned hen-pen, the last one only a few weeks earlier. The female kakapo did not lay again until 1952. The total population of kakapo fell from 1,200 to around 250 by this time.\n\nThe kakapo population rose and fell along with rainfall, and in 1989\/90, only two kakapo were estimated to be alive. At this time the birds were restricted to a small and remote group in the south Fiordland National Park. An estimated 1,500 people worked on various kakapo conservation projects between 1972 and 1992. Funding remained difficult to secure until more than $80,000 was secured in 1992 and 1993 for a kakapo recovery team that was based south of Lake < unk > Ihu. The team was headed by the Department of Conservation (DOC) and had members from < unk > and overseas. They were responsible for the day-to-day care of kakapo. The project included work on the kakapo's behaviour in the wild and intensive captive breeding, with the aim of eventually reintroducing kakapo to the South Island.\n\nThe kakapo has now been reintroduced to many populations, including Westland, Stewart Island, the South Island, Queen Charlotte Sound, Stewart Island, and Lake Hawea, both in the South Island and the West Coast. The first kakapo to be released were two birds taken from the south Fiordland National Park. They were named 'Pukeko' and 'Kakapo'.\n\nThey were introduced to a reserve in the South Island near Te Anau, Lake Hayes 'Ngaui Kapa', where they remained for around five years before they were returned to their original site at the southernmost extent of the Fiordland region. The aim was to release the birds as close to where they were born as possible, so they would not require additional resources while attempting to establish new territories.\n\nThe new site was chosen and the birds were prepared for release over two weeks. This included fitting them with satellite transmitters at Te Anau and a GPS receiver on a chain around their legs to track their location and movement after they were released.\n\nThe kakapo were released at the southern tip of Lake < unk > Hayes 'Ngaui Kapa' on March 23, 2004. An estimated 2,000 people crowded into the reserve that day to see the birds released. They were accompanied by three DOC officers and a vet. Although the birds were fitted with the satellite tracking devices, they were allowed to leave the reserve through the main gate after this day. They were allowed to roam free, and were not fitted with collars.","token_len":623,"entropy":[2.6222,6.5129,0.0864,0.4221,1.9114,5.385,4.4328,8.3852,1.3364,2.5197,3.1667,2.6254,4.5267,5.9217,5.6527,5.7782,0.0107,0.3338,5.6522,0.3245,2.363,6.6422,5.4558,0.3082,1.6069,6.75,1.3838,12.352,0.2817,0.0062,2.1361,8.3531,1.2431,0.0289,1.7681,13.5139,10.3213,5.1906,9.8643,5.4648,1.1177,0.8421,1.9795,2.4555,0.0099,0.0061,1.8828,2.5569,0.0218,5.1078,0.0034,0.0051,0.7906,1.8616,1.1696,1.355,1.1442,3.36,5.4242,1.3587,1.341,4.9985,4.8517,5.2342,1.3575,0.0191,0.0496,7.2715,0.2336,3.9274,2.3049,3.2112,3.1111,8.4495,3.2936,5.2348,3.5764,3.1454,3.3773,1.9706,6.7037,3.5121,0.3395,2.6303,3.3113,0.5039,1.7728,6.0036,0.9644,0.004,0.006,5.6134,0.2569,4.4365,8.1407,0.5639,4.4716,1.2764,1.95,6.6548,3.3082,0.6327,1.8005,0.0061,0.0615,5.6366,0.9287,3.1867,0.2847,3.3038,0.9191,3.6166,3.8515,2.6119,5.0127,0.0742,0.9143,2.019,0.0286,1.7111,1.4962,0.011,0.0082,2.9736,4.3675,4.7104,1.1502,4.6571,0.3054,8.5659,1.2874,1.9369,2.5592,7.2998,6.3074,0.145,0.915,5.3579,3.8711,1.3152,0.0343,0.0087,2.0376,6.4471,0.1753,1.2631,3.3133,0.9022,4.5495,1.2653,0.4422,2.6214,6.0153,0.6706,5.6044,0.2545,2.3306,2.0298,5.1888,3.1753,5.171,2.8576,0.8365,3.8497,12.4938,0.0591,0.0242,2.6171,0.0765,0.8529,5.6104,1.8447,2.5433,0.2046,1.842,4.2859,5.0255,1.6974,6.447,3.9326,0.0086,0.0158,2.6321,0.2745,4.3542,4.9156,0.1732,2.93,0.5436,9.1067,5.923,6.5998,1.1715,4.9728,4.5231,5.6375,1.1701,2.7643,5.0324,2.1688,0.0021,0.5325,4.281,1.7729,2.4526,2.7373,2.3309,2.7296,2.7347,3.7627,0.0207,0.0046,4.8555,4.2912,3.3933,2.3544,4.0174,6.6105,0.286,6.383,12.4335,2.7301,0.015,0.1521,7.4681,7.933,2.5054,1.7014,1.6227,1.6354,5.1691,0.0501,3.0539,5.0789,0.0443,0.8999,2.7061,2.1619,0.589,1.1424,3.7339,6.4152,0.6355,6.8252,0.5545,0.003,0.0197,2.8461,9.1223,1.3915,3.6645,1.4253,3.2867,0.0092,1.7386,7.5335,0.2201,0.0507,0.0006,0.0036,3.5642,0.4102,2.3918,0.0192,0.0409,3.0368,1.9438,4.5166,3.4076,5.0696,0.5992,1.7203,2.4624,0.0254,0.0035,1.9517,7.2242,2.8447,1.0238,2.8577,1.2042,6.8371,7.2328,0.4092,2.2188,4.1578,1.7771,3.0668,0.0842,5.0666,3.2639,0.0374,2.9795,0.0128,0.0108,0.725,0.9814,5.9689,0.6574,0.6304,1.0465,0.0002,1.4526,1.63,0.0082,0.0023,3.4121,4.3965,0.6627,1.9573,0.007,0.4168,5.1283,7.4639,2.6143,1.2986,7.2187,3.1516,1.2303,9.8231,1.7371,0.6394,2.4914,3.941,0.2637,1.0304,8.3579,3.8877,8.3622,0.7671,7.1872,0.4862,0.7375,1.4607,5.1752,6.0925,8.6237,2.185,4.5344,1.4109,0.9636,2.5282,0.2575,1.5363,1.7842,4.8405,3.2145,0.8421,1.7064,3.6404,1.286,0.0109,0.0074,2.8895,0.3403,3.1695,5.3185,4.8771,4.8389,5.3902,0.5746,0.9764,5.026,4.2512,0.0518,0.0016,0.5011,0.0138,2.82,2.8625,0.4385,4.2583,3.8487,4.1665,6.5485,3.2335,0.7036,0.7149,0.3676,1.7632,1.1581,0.3532,0.6846,1.8383,0.0002,5.823,1.4137,3.2734,0.7152,3.9837,5.9707,1.1336,1.4702,2.8057,0.2542,4.7976,6.746,5.7532,3.8495,2.0005,7.3257,9.4876,8.5416,3.7511,6.0424,3.0293,5.2312,10.7939,3.176,1.6642,3.1348,0.5052,4.4176,0.806,4.4342,3.0167,0.1802,2.4028,2.4895,0.2317,4.6047,0.1965,2.1212,1.4826,5.929,3.7202,2.0047,4.481,4.7943,6.1773,1.1254,0.4246,5.6778,0.0171,0.0078,4.8352,0.359,1.603,8.1537,0.8344,0.095,4.1828,1.3477,1.2284,3.2633,4.1495,0.4485,5.7675,0.1764,1.325,4.6438,0.4084,0.017,1.5881,2.827,1.8385,2.067,0.8022,5.2768,4.6743,5.9461,6.5206,5.8939,0.0847,3.9587,2.7822,3.7047,0.4627,1.5324,0.0001,1.4085,4.5166,5.9508,0.9732,3.8346,4.8246,2.2525,2.3144,0.3835,7.7158,0.8835,1.4798,6.7041,3.3261,2.6714,0.964,3.7885,3.7341,9.689,4.3039,1.8851,7.9677,4.6246,0.0006,4.7068,4.7254,0.0511,0.0014,1.0813,3.7589,5.3492,2.7631,2.8373,3.2541,8.5674,4.6571,3.9192,6.1328,2.4894,3.2428,0.8684,3.3417,2.3724,3.6219,7.5335,1.835,0.5525,0.2823,0.2727,1.6445,0.0001,1.2857,2.253,0.0064,0.0021,1.1553,1.8211,3.0536,1.6823,4.3905,3.357,0.02,2.9052,3.7176,0.1696,0.0015,0.016,8.5249,1.8815,0.0461,0.0098,0.0005,0.002,0.0519,0.0012,2.5514,2.465,3.7618,3.3573,0.2041,4.0942,0.5256,5.5761,0.887,2.8491,0.1365,1.1542,3.3495,7.6259,0.896,0.3336,6.609,5.2567,0.7509,0.9332,3.0061,0.5383,0.3691,2.4629,0.5519,3.2882,0.5365,6.3931,0.0595,4.321,7.9705,3.2334,1.1998,1.6932,6.78,1.2658,5.8928,1.1631,1.6266,0.4376,7.8881,0.1277,3.7555,4.9513,4.8246,2.9873,0.6762,1.189,0.6544,5.1717,0.3902,3.2637,0.907,1.0068,4.9641,1.0175,3.9665,1.1015,5.1048,5.8492,5.0393,0.6197,3.0765,0.3884,3.7095,0.3812,4.4261,2.7895,3.0646,2.0326,1.6099,2.6974,6.4988,0.0729,7.6773,0.0245,1.0939]}
{"id":376,"ended":true,"length":573,"text":"In contrast to much theatre of the time, The Importance of Being Earnest's light plot does not tackle serious social and political issues, something of which contemporary reviewers were wary. Though considered one of the best plays of the period, critics of the time were not kind to the play, with some saying it was \" a mere fad \" (John Archer, The Stage, 31 March 1887 ) and another critic calling Earnest \" the worse play that ever was attempted \" (Edwin Muir, The Morning Post, 18 January 1887 ). [1] At the time, however, the play was not seen to have much chance of success, and only two years after its initial production had been given up as \" a poor piece of work \" (Edmund Kean in The Morning Post, October 1886 ): \"No one expects to be much out of pocket at a farce, but to pay a fair price to go to the theatre to be knocked about in this manner is too much\" (L. G. J. Stirling, The Morning Post, 19 May 1888 ).\n\nDetermined to see the play performed in London, Wilde met producer Sir Edward Davenport - who had recently revived Othello - and he managed the rights for \u00a3100. [3] The play was performed in the autumn of 1885 at the Lyceum Theatre (currently the Prince Edward Theatre ) in London. Its success was not immediate, but following subsequent performances its reputation began to grow, with critics calling it \u201c a piece of genius\u201d (The Morning Post, 18 February 1887 ).\n\nA film version of both The Importance of Being Earnest and the next play in the series The Importance of Being Earnest's sequel Lady Windemere's Fan was intended to be made by Wilde and director Thomas Bentley, but Wilde suffered a mental breakdown on the set early on. After his hospitalisation, Bentley decided not to finish the film and the project was abandoned. The film was never produced and neither play was released on film. See the article on the Thomas Bentley film adaptations below.\n\nThe Importance of Being Earnest received further positive reviews after its London runs, including a positive review in The Morning Post's theatre review by Arthur Symons. Symons would later edit Wilde's memoir, and his positive review was published just prior to its publication in 1887. It is thought that at this point, Symons' review was a premeditated act to raise the play's profile after its initial production and its relative lack in reviews at that time.\n\nIn the United States, the play was well-received for its first two seasons, making the national stage regularly. In 1887, Oscar Wilde himself gave a lecture to the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, \"The Importance of Art and the Artist in Society\", which was subsequently published as The Soul of the Art and the Soul of an Artist. In this lecture he defended himself against criticism, and his comments on art form are considered an essential part of the play.","token_len":623,"entropy":[9.5127,1.4842,7.1666,13.0538,3.9542,1.8724,2.3318,0.2772,5.3085,8.511,0.0018,0.1719,2.2618,5.4983,0.0578,7.0698,8.0599,8.7286,4.3131,0.5928,7.2361,6.1982,3.9079,3.0234,0.5289,0.3713,2.1405,7.2549,4.6497,0.4934,7.6325,7.4366,4.658,6.0622,2.3986,5.4984,8.3679,3.6432,0.0214,0.2952,1.5226,4.8763,0.6697,0.7571,3.6745,0.2652,7.8587,3.1466,1.3956,1.9527,1.9108,2.7341,8.0336,0.1973,1.3593,2.1142,1.2587,3.5125,2.4109,2.9372,1.1245,0.8153,1.9965,8.4367,5.2523,5.6141,2.2933,1.4995,2.6496,5.9563,8.4322,0.7535,1.8787,7.8725,1.6201,6.6873,3.675,2.8377,3.4738,8.1129,0.8425,4.7532,0.6722,3.1631,13.853,0.0064,0.5378,3.3013,7.589,1.8128,4.2777,1.614,1.1856,8.4596,3.5111,0.2381,5.6153,2.1049,8.0542,0.4291,0.2127,0.9825,6.8577,2.6633,0.1274,3.3014,3.657,0.7733,0.6376,1.0944,6.516,2.2958,0.0278,5.8714,0.7986,0.7839,0.6498,2.6804,0.0027,1.894,1.4807,0.834,2.9627,4.6302,3.7357,1.4537,2.0211,5.6705,0.1036,1.7395,1.4369,1.4176,4.9756,3.1434,2.2784,1.3515,1.1192,4.2624,3.7503,2.736,0.4991,5.1285,3.9407,5.9573,3.674,2.9224,4.4585,4.4401,1.1461,2.7344,0.2855,0.6024,4.5535,3.1171,6.4719,3.9836,5.8368,1.0825,3.4703,0.0281,0.1101,5.8637,7.1074,6.7986,1.4292,5.4226,1.775,5.4582,2.2522,2.1336,6.4494,6.0886,0.2003,6.461,3.5588,2.1805,8.5087,3.6784,1.9984,0.994,3.9764,4.6835,2.1672,4.3547,0.5283,2.7432,6.1448,1.8987,1.8485,1.9753,3.1778,4.022,8.0529,3.8025,2.6943,4.2649,2.1937,1.1369,4.9608,0.626,4.7335,0.0727,5.1071,2.3702,4.4842,0.7117,5.8263,0.7994,5.3996,4.1508,0.3278,0.8965,2.7875,0.0106,0.0438,3.7352,2.6087,2.2371,0.9171,1.7345,0.474,6.1432,5.4586,0.3155,4.7234,1.5395,0.5267,5.1778,1.8836,2.5597,0.7411,8.8176,6.1457,7.9771,4.7301,3.6741,5.517,4.1484,0.0062,7.2585,1.5767,1.302,3.8341,7.9829,6.9867,2.4915,0.0025,1.2651,1.456,4.3758,7.2004,4.5597,5.511,2.4684,6.0899,2.926,2.4907,4.5465,4.3438,0.0239,2.0729,1.3603,0.8666,4.156,1.1772,2.1174,6.1074,0.1199,0.6731,2.3149,2.2512,0.7711,6.0122,0.4002,0.0226,0.8421,3.5024,7.1411,1.8091,7.3879,3.4396,0.8684,4.7918,0.9511,1.217,1.7427,4.1198,3.782,1.426,3.1736,6.25,0.4627,1.4597,5.9595,6.23,3.2344,6.8208,3.3688,3.6887,0.0149,2.8123,2.12,1.8144,3.6456,2.584,0.4327,14.3935,6.6485,4.8799,5.219,0.4048,5.8505,6.8638,7.1524,2.8551,4.0764,2.4414,0.0036,0.0313,2.1049,2.9905,0.911,0.5506,0.9451,1.4068,0.0002,3.782,6.004,3.1184,0.3669,8.2075,1.3764,0.4148,0.0009,0.0083,0.0721,0.001,0.0003,0.2697,2.7622,6.2589,3.911,3.313,0.5654,0.9469,2.9377,1.5927,0.0015,0.0314,0.0734,0.012,0.001,5.919,5.7144,9.9376,6.4187,6.8563,0.369,2.984,9.4595,3.5552,7.6348,0.7431,0.6775,2.5973,1.5816,4.0362,1.7601,5.6701,4.9149,8.4347,1.6952,1.3313,4.1447,7.1339,1.006,5.1006,0.5412,3.9212,1.1731,1.9963,7.7724,0.9978,2.3086,3.5054,3.1568,5.137,1.1535,0.7449,5.2803,3.4768,3.7763,0.0013,5.8235,0.6539,1.1137,2.1552,4.0208,3.4176,0.577,2.3282,0.6607,2.4974,2.6576,1.1729,3.322,3.1736,1.8155,6.1756,6.7736,1.5407,3.3676,4.133,2.2999,0.9568,6.7751,3.1247,3.984,2.2284,1.9805,8.6299,0.1809,1.5203,5.283,2.6507,0.5232,0.3499,0.0001,1.7309,2.1658,0.0029,0.0204,0.0066,0.0035,0.0018,5.8993,7.2405,4.0716,0.1844,3.4079,1.5535,6.5836,7.7124,1.5881,2.7666,2.2127,4.1238,0.1552,1.6613,1.3822,4.3131,0.0076,4.4621,7.8427,0.9848,5.1868,4.6879,7.3978,3.1587,1.3224,4.1433,0.0027,6.0544,0.8484,4.2688,4.2422,0.0376,6.989,1.7291,4.3417,3.5829,7.09,0.613,2.0632,2.0594,7.148,3.5839,0.0064,2.1112,2.4476,1.1709,4.1715,0.6311,0.613,3.5576,2.3427,4.0565,0.3589,4.6406,2.2108,1.4134,1.5313,4.5379,0.0024,3.993,2.8051,0.8742,3.3814,5.2822,4.0127,0.0159,3.931,2.8935,5.2705,1.7707,4.3238,0.2505,1.4901,5.0525,2.3854,2.6023,2.9289,3.5257,3.8099,7.5405,2.3512,4.2321,4.3376,4.3988,1.7876,0.2206,0.351,1.3961,0.0001,2.4999,2.0864,4.9384,0.1472,0.3278,1.465,1.349,1.1399,6.1973,2.0816,0.1884,4.6604,0.2297,6.1608,1.8658,3.1674,0.9248,4.903,2.9188,5.7931,2.7265,6.9211,1.2605,1.9897,2.0155,0.6781,0.5526,4.6238,0.3924,5.5083,4.1211,1.6441,3.6828,2.5804,0.7379,2.7626,0.1177,4.0434,1.8137,0.8882,7.1324,0.0813,0.0439,8.0194,2.3649,4.8431,2.6058,3.1188,0.001,0.0236,10.8973,1.8522,2.6686,6.7778,2.9348,3.7177,1.8442,1.6584,1.4204,4.9572,2.8146,2.2152,1.2199,11.1606,0.423,1.7982,3.97,3.2706,0.8231,1.9599,0.0205,6.1724,0.5861,1.393,2.5345,3.2808,1.4954,3.082,6.7021,5.6682,0.4573,1.6391,1.6875,2.1566,3.6358,4.5777,2.1143,3.1419,6.1316,3.9159,3.8385,3.7792,3.2042,0.6978,0.0118,1.4702,1.3514,1.0553]}
{"id":4493,"ended":false,"length":526,"text":"Unas assumed the throne at the death of his predecessor Djedkare Isesi. Djedkare is thought to have been Unas'father, in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question, and Djedkare was the first recorded ruler of Ethiopia (according to oral tradition, the first documented ruler was Tiglath Pileser V of Assyria). As the king of an independent land surrounded by enemies, Unas had no choice but to defend his kingdom with might against aggressors.[1]\n\nUnas, whose full epithet is unknown, fought as far south as the city of Seqenenre Tageot (modern Shashamane), and also participated in the disastrous expedition to subdue Axum that was launched by Ashurbanipal. In the late 1150s, Shumshi K'abu invaded his kingdom and defeated him in battle, forcing him to flee to the Nile delta.\n\nHe also ruled over the entire region of the Great Rift Valley that is now Tanzania, as well as parts of Kenya and Uganda, and in the mid-1170s, he sent forces to the Zanzibar region, possibly in support of his brother Qemant, who was fighting against the Almohad caliph.\n\nUnas I of Abyssinia was the son of Djedkare Isesi of the Agedena dynasty. He is known from the history of Shumshi K'abu of the Kaffa kingdom, whose troops assisted Emperor Ashurbanipal of Assyria in his war against Axum. However, this evidence may only be circumstantial, and could not be verified. According to the Sudanese oral tradition, Unas I ruled southern Ethiopia and the Lake Victoria shore between the 1150s and the late 1170s.[2]\n\nHe made many friends with the Egyptian queen, who was a major benefactor to the Agedena. This was no doubt, due to her efforts to help free her son, Djer (or D'or) who was taken captive by the Agedena in his attempt to free her people from the oppressive rule. After securing the release of Djer, Queen Theodora, with the help of his brother, Unas I built for her a castle and a fortress in which she would be safe as long as she stayed there.[1] This castle later got its name after her at Qift, and a village near by.[3] In spite of this great favor and goodwill of both nations for each other, it is a well known fact that the Queen and her court stayed at the castle of Unas I for a few months and then returned home. What makes this story ironic is the fact that the queen had a temple built for Unas I in the middle of it all![1] One can also see how Djent was the only king mentioned in every book written about the Queen and her kingdom.[4] This fact alone proves how he was viewed and respected by his people.[4]","token_len":624,"entropy":[6.2924,11.0594,1.5209,5.0422,3.296,0.7543,4.1744,0.0227,2.2463,4.4713,9.0746,5.5953,6.1107,6.1115,7.3757,13.5448,1.6546,4.2811,0.0105,0.0049,0.0027,3.0209,4.567,0.1177,0.1771,1.2696,11.9504,0.1189,0.9447,13.1013,0.9692,5.4197,3.7032,0.0406,1.6946,10.2943,1.3149,0.004,0.7531,8.6292,1.3053,1.4983,4.2552,3.0542,1.0104,4.3323,0.0035,0.0019,0.0011,1.866,3.1395,2.5557,6.9231,1.6493,0.6368,3.9215,3.8995,4.7707,0.0022,6.6746,0.717,1.9606,2.449,2.6465,5.7285,0.9408,2.0993,7.8511,4.3953,0.621,7.2707,7.5041,3.6325,7.351,6.3843,5.7575,0.0332,1.1957,4.0618,2.502,3.9476,0.6389,4.8655,2.8728,4.1527,7.5094,0.0856,4.3398,0.5176,1.4619,0.0033,2.897,2.0043,2.9938,0.044,0.0087,4.6188,0.9446,2.1939,4.1237,7.5918,4.721,7.2214,0.2064,5.1069,2.4478,0.132,0.5263,0.0003,2.9162,0.0587,3.5242,4.6002,6.3496,10.7136,0.3782,1.6513,4.3361,0.4004,5.8289,3.379,6.9913,2.0662,0.0428,1.7239,4.9326,0.0202,6.3497,6.8828,4.4672,5.9887,8.5714,9.2929,8.2568,8.0988,2.1231,2.7065,5.5438,6.5994,6.0996,8.4931,1.2856,2.2519,4.6142,5.963,0.0813,0.759,8.4747,4.9754,1.0648,6.7907,0.0445,11.0141,4.4217,5.906,2.9834,2.787,0.6648,6.8691,3.2271,0.0009,2.3114,2.9045,1.5432,4.1773,4.0026,4.4585,0.1206,0.4384,6.493,9.4179,8.5097,4.8883,5.2768,5.446,4.3717,5.7622,4.6538,2.3161,1.3004,2.6873,2.5342,2.1179,1.7899,1.3996,4.3583,1.3013,0.1286,1.2039,1.4162,1.4868,4.8821,4.6992,1.0895,3.3722,0.0002,4.0541,3.443,4.1867,2.1121,1.4604,4.9019,2.9469,1.0465,1.8397,5.4263,2.4914,0.2017,4.6078,2.8765,1.2339,6.4048,1.082,3.6639,0.2931,0.0064,3.5305,0.0119,3.9811,1.166,1.9972,1.4982,1.8085,3.6555,1.4053,4.3591,0.2107,2.256,2.3009,0.011,1.2059,1.4108,4.9485,4.801,0.4506,2.1146,7.3461,1.0479,0.0005,0.0,2.5371,2.1285,6.7035,2.7172,3.3579,0.0049,1.7872,3.6876,5.8592,6.3037,4.1213,3.3109,0.9546,0.9409,4.2475,2.0427,1.4791,8.8564,1.7933,1.7477,9.1593,0.0898,2.0571,1.8357,0.0002,1.9551,0.0179,8.6294,3.303,6.6681,0.0295,2.2521,2.0638,2.7299,0.0335,3.4637,0.0663,0.0249,0.0381,0.6035,0.0137,3.6622,2.097,5.4541,4.1011,13.0726,1.477,1.6529,1.2791,2.6572,3.3317,4.3408,1.8404,4.9216,0.4155,6.3789,2.1593,0.0738,0.3864,0.0081,0.0142,0.0039,4.2238,1.5967,5.1854,6.1953,1.9349,4.4565,1.321,4.1211,6.9083,5.6437,8.2846,3.9059,0.07,0.0006,3.4348,4.4844,0.0047,0.8209,1.7427,3.4265,0.1512,5.1262,0.0013,0.6442,4.5473,0.0344,3.6299,5.698,4.0694,4.0824,0.6988,3.1414,0.0066,0.0132,0.9734,1.2201,4.5855,1.4106,0.7017,2.5824,2.2666,4.8892,0.0021,1.7776,7.1009,0.1359,5.7413,0.32,0.106,1.0295,0.0055,2.213,4.4112,7.985,0.9065,2.4994,2.0125,7.2843,5.9989,9.8508,6.1494,1.5735,6.2875,0.9324,0.1181,0.0351,1.7925,4.7175,0.5466,1.556,0.0041,3.0101,0.308,0.0501,0.4337,0.0001,3.6616,5.5478,3.6885,4.737,1.9855,1.2779,5.188,3.934,2.4514,3.655,1.5769,3.0231,5.162,4.3941,0.0133,1.4858,1.376,4.0542,0.0365,0.1434,3.2213,3.8023,2.557,6.2433,2.3442,5.5538,1.9356,0.0974,1.6536,5.1525,0.4457,3.3735,6.6755,1.8886,2.6108,1.6988,4.1889,8.4515,6.2526,4.1181,5.719,4.4561,5.5761,2.7444,3.6257,0.9941,4.3961,1.1965,0.4963,1.1107,2.1551,0.0109,0.1463,2.3898,3.1391,3.2258,0.0263,2.7864,2.2835,6.403,0.7728,1.1021,4.9305,2.3369,4.8658,3.7652,7.5465,1.4693,1.4611,0.1177,3.1041,0.013,0.8631,5.812,6.9282,1.2113,0.3468,2.1988,5.5499,1.1032,0.7797,0.002,3.6315,2.4531,1.4863,4.6852,0.0112,2.1966,5.7012,7.9377,2.4175,0.8849,3.8048,2.2726,2.4453,4.4291,2.0731,3.4466,1.6361,2.3153,2.9328,3.6943,4.2847,2.0384,0.0038,0.6823,3.0221,3.4028,1.9835,2.5289,0.042,4.6642,2.3725,6.2747,7.5593,2.1862,0.108,2.9993,2.4578,5.6203,7.6142,9.6754,4.9745,2.5822,4.7058,6.7792,3.0363,7.1662,3.9345,0.4737,0.0356,4.0253,5.4735,0.0046,1.3195,6.2479,4.9058,4.0674,5.4047,4.3725,5.1492,4.2031,3.904,4.487,0.0142,0.1799,2.8819,1.219,5.5736,5.9703,0.9772,0.076,0.0387,1.8698,5.6876,3.5307,0.94,5.9504,5.9508,1.9166,0.9879,2.1204,1.7416,2.097,0.024,1.1058,1.9928,1.9621,3.0261,1.656,3.2818,2.3761,1.2829,2.0249,1.3354,7.5825,3.632,0.5989,3.1518,8.2155,0.3245,2.3928,0.2353,0.0275,1.6473,2.2069,3.1276,2.5538,7.9306,2.177,2.9094,2.968,0.005,1.3865,2.0065,1.2361,4.137,0.0214,5.9962,3.377,6.1138,3.5657,1.5978,0.043,6.5031,2.4488,2.627,1.6904,2.4232,5.0979,8.3361,4.9541,3.1385,3.2906,3.6278,6.9302,0.7591,6.767,4.33,3.7592,1.3688,1.5811,5.0399,2.3038,0.8776,3.795,2.5917,0.6272,0.0299,4.1637,3.4056,2.0865,4.0679,3.834,6.2332,0.9988,5.6299,3.5075,3.3433,0.6892,2.0615,1.0312,2.6851,2.6017,0.053]}
{"id":2415,"ended":true,"length":590,"text":"A frequent criticism of the Bates method is that it has remained relatively obscure, which is seen as proof that it is not truly effective. Writer Alan M. MacRobert concluded in a 1979 critique that \u201cwe are witnessing the development of a form of psychotherapy that will, like the Bates method, continue to remain obscure, even as it achieves greater recognition\u2026, perhaps because it does not fit the current pattern of American psychiatry.\u201d\n\nThis is unfortunate, not only because the Bates method is a much more effective treatment model, but because this criticism demonstrates our inability to see outside of our current and established ways of thinking about things.\n\nIf we only accept the status quo, then the way forward will be clear. A good example is the recent controversy surrounding the decision by the US Food and Drug Administration to approve the use of the breast cancer drug Tamoxifen. Supporters of the drug claim a \u201cgold standard\u201d of research indicates that the drug is effective in reversing the effects of women's breast cancer, while drug protesters say that the research shows otherwise.\n\nThis debate can easily be solved by following the logical chain from where the evidence comes. For our present use, all we need to know is that cancerous cells can grow in a laboratory dish. That much information can be learned in ten minutes by anyone with access to a good college biology textbook. When we know that, we can test specific drugs, giving the ones that kill cancer cells more exposure than those that do not. That will tell us which drugs are working, but also which of the other drugs given to the same patients are not.\n\nWe could then use this information to develop treatments by combining drugs from drug protesters and drug supporters that are most effective. That will tell us which drugs work best together.\n\nThere is also another reason why this debate is so important. We live in a \u201cno-brainer\u201d society. When things become obvious like the right method for treating cancer, or of course the existence of the Easter Bunny it seems to many that it does no good to debate the matter. In such society, even drug users get high and do no harm. So it is understandable that they want to believe that most popular ideas are true, and are happy to keep their opinions to themselves.\n\nBut that is not what makes life interesting. What makes life interesting is the clash of opposing views with each side trying to establish their position by gathering evidence. Even a simple scientific dispute requires an open discussion.\n\nThat is why scientific journals are so important in a society that cannot be trusted to use reason and evidence to arrive at decisions. With such a society, even people like Alan MacRobert, which have done so much work to try to promote the Bates method will end up criticizing it. They are happy it is not getting more notice, but also unhappy that their own work is not as popular as they would hope.\n\nThat illustrates the importance of the scientific method in society. When we put blinders on and refuse to consider evidence, we are doing ourselves ill.","token_len":624,"entropy":[10.4038,6.1247,0.3164,1.5186,11.9579,5.3732,0.9131,0.3265,0.4467,3.8629,7.932,3.9652,4.9847,2.0263,4.0658,1.1833,7.7778,0.7568,5.2701,0.4193,1.9544,0.8892,1.6747,5.3795,3.4862,0.6301,11.2419,5.2245,5.5589,1.0952,6.3874,8.2909,7.025,1.5661,2.1189,5.0352,5.5439,1.7392,12.2947,7.6589,6.5228,2.1654,4.6737,1.3252,4.6205,0.0803,0.8696,4.7863,0.1082,5.0568,1.1316,0.7598,4.5913,3.9258,4.865,1.2791,1.9734,0.3192,0.0756,5.2084,0.3261,5.567,2.9515,2.3474,2.2588,1.4535,1.4878,6.9524,3.7018,4.0716,7.4862,6.2793,4.9797,1.9429,1.3549,4.3657,0.2228,4.6975,1.4219,4.3975,4.4912,0.2061,5.9658,2.7447,1.9495,5.6249,6.4984,1.1774,0.0017,3.7081,1.628,5.713,0.9768,4.9386,1.0335,0.176,2.3114,1.8885,0.32,1.0832,2.767,5.1784,0.8779,1.7269,3.0557,5.8188,2.0748,0.2432,1.0679,4.8616,6.2439,6.931,6.6794,2.4051,0.0522,3.0649,5.958,0.8248,2.1865,3.5178,5.079,5.934,5.201,0.0728,1.2339,0.8791,6.3646,0.546,2.0141,0.0001,4.4237,1.2681,5.7685,4.9364,1.0678,5.3616,0.0683,0.8395,1.9016,2.5355,4.582,4.1551,1.9106,0.6438,4.4916,0.603,4.5881,5.0669,2.8756,1.8202,1.0591,3.4935,4.1797,2.1477,0.8616,7.1754,1.0521,0.9761,3.6918,2.9618,0.0154,0.0008,0.002,0.3934,2.8614,1.2839,0.5277,0.014,2.2484,10.1557,1.2771,1.1216,7.4984,0.4819,0.0009,0.02,1.2187,8.1099,0.3402,0.4699,1.0207,2.6653,6.594,12.1564,4.2024,7.7278,0.1616,1.4564,4.9457,3.5682,5.5464,6.243,0.4309,2.0288,1.6592,1.4292,1.9535,1.5214,6.025,2.2695,1.9581,0.03,7.4429,1.3494,1.211,0.1542,1.6424,3.9112,7.4418,9.436,2.8429,1.2878,1.6526,5.6771,2.1461,4.4516,0.1593,1.1766,0.0002,2.9667,2.7614,4.4893,4.1481,0.5851,4.1238,0.6391,5.3202,0.5215,5.8374,4.4262,5.481,4.0023,1.405,4.2072,2.7182,2.4365,4.404,5.6811,4.1186,5.587,1.1874,5.7763,1.2874,0.4876,0.543,2.1193,0.1762,0.2572,8.0027,6.0711,1.4514,2.9724,3.4008,1.3184,2.2894,4.453,5.9261,2.1076,3.8418,7.5038,4.549,2.6462,0.3611,4.0898,2.7909,5.1707,0.7662,2.5643,4.793,1.9438,3.4833,0.0039,0.8712,4.7512,7.1692,4.9044,0.8176,0.449,5.1969,1.3799,4.9753,1.1708,5.0545,0.7641,0.5897,5.8957,8.0015,2.9811,2.5267,7.3009,2.5702,8.656,0.9692,5.9221,1.2349,1.2795,3.7662,4.7579,3.5428,2.4928,0.1555,2.1911,0.0835,0.2265,3.6399,3.1879,5.2901,0.0741,3.0205,0.888,1.0868,5.1554,1.7372,3.2492,4.342,1.3597,4.5404,1.6509,3.4064,0.9846,8.5296,1.544,2.7638,2.3481,2.0576,1.6127,2.6175,0.9731,0.9001,0.0002,3.0668,3.7161,2.5879,2.928,1.4794,1.1952,0.1681,3.0889,3.3348,6.4767,4.5364,4.9059,3.3346,6.7012,9.5593,1.6559,3.6376,3.4106,3.6838,1.8012,6.0716,0.3525,1.2626,3.1636,2.8047,4.0217,0.0573,0.5902,0.4881,2.351,0.9567,6.089,2.3387,1.5127,0.0002,3.9253,0.9059,2.6246,2.9132,3.666,0.8691,2.8235,1.7004,1.2531,0.9425,0.7043,0.5286,2.3561,4.2051,0.0467,0.344,10.9247,0.1524,6.0814,1.7003,3.3709,1.1366,1.1144,2.1835,0.6705,3.7987,5.0056,4.2667,3.7646,6.3254,1.3357,6.4156,6.8529,2.2526,1.2627,0.6008,0.4885,4.165,6.2668,5.4982,1.6662,8.5755,0.0253,2.4653,11.3772,0.7712,8.1069,3.589,2.4054,4.5398,2.0884,2.4609,4.6197,5.9646,0.4426,1.8926,5.1902,1.8369,4.1373,0.4381,3.7248,4.6392,6.0455,0.3577,3.7542,8.191,3.7421,4.8335,6.1041,1.9648,4.8382,6.2096,1.3779,0.4818,4.1763,2.5239,0.7137,3.8597,0.4514,3.2767,2.4778,0.3098,4.8932,0.2777,6.5293,7.4183,5.9129,0.9855,3.311,1.3941,1.7204,4.7525,7.9768,0.1832,4.5323,2.0058,2.9016,0.9339,0.0132,0.247,1.0087,0.0002,1.782,3.1164,0.9165,0.369,2.0417,4.9886,6.3145,3.1409,0.3585,4.0347,0.2938,0.7383,0.3089,0.1859,1.9528,10.7505,1.1396,5.3989,1.5726,5.3355,2.5065,5.8689,4.3792,0.0278,5.2255,1.8884,2.9127,3.5347,8.225,1.2108,1.0376,5.3113,4.2281,3.0032,3.7628,5.755,6.2236,3.0778,4.4463,2.4871,1.1486,1.9343,0.0002,4.1801,0.7772,0.51,6.0587,5.9921,1.6793,1.7055,0.6801,2.5478,4.1065,3.0384,1.5911,5.1895,2.9023,4.4196,0.6181,6.0545,6.7989,2.0097,2.2456,1.4489,6.2823,0.0081,4.6114,0.4498,5.876,3.0244,0.7889,1.547,0.283,3.7975,4.3878,3.2696,3.6668,1.5911,0.2733,2.0902,6.1636,3.1262,5.264,2.2024,0.8375,3.7302,1.5856,3.4731,0.8848,5.3393,1.5415,1.6739,0.1935,8.8162,5.0234,0.0062,6.599,1.1057,1.2034,3.3372,2.6093,7.0322,6.8972,1.2151,2.2761,5.2671,3.2676,7.4986,1.4955,1.2514,5.3805,3.917,0.5897,3.27,3.1552,2.8222,0.9472,2.194,5.0546,3.7,0.5622,1.7937,2.5551,6.2233,0.3854,0.4689,0.0002,4.064,8.6764,1.0351,3.3715,0.0406,2.5941,3.3487,0.7302,1.3149,2.6966,0.4726,3.7527,2.0553,5.1366,9.2123,1.2733,0.0517,3.9677,5.0762,0.0549,4.0411,3.0477,0.7658,0.7141,1.741,4.1631,3.7043,6.4882,0.2896]}
{"id":207,"ended":true,"length":451,"text":"On December 4, 2013, the Tigers signed Nathan to a two @ - @ year, $ 20 million contract, with a club option for 2016. This reunited him with former Tigers coach [url=http:\/\/www.torontosshoessale.com\/authentic-mike-mulvey-authentic-jersey-c-1_7.html?catalogId=10]http:\/\/www.torontosshoessale.com\/authentic-mike-mulvey-authentic-jersey-c-1_7.html?catalogId=10[\/url]Jim Leyland. Nathan is now one year into the deal and had another strong season in 2014. The righty won 16 games, but his 11.5 K\/9 rate was the lowest of his career. He also had a career high in ERA, but a career low in FIP. He also finished the season in the top 10 in the American League with 30 home runs allowed and a league high 121 hits allowed.\n\nThe Tigers also signed Ervin Santana to a three @ - @ year, $ 36 million deal in November of 2013, but Ervin has not pitched well at all since the Tigers signed him. There is speculation that Ervin may want out, but that was not confirmed as of February 27th.\n\n[color=#008000;]With a rotation that consists of JT Chatwood, James Shields and Ian Kennedy, who is your favorite [url=http:\/\/www.texasrangersale.com\/authentic-derek-holland-authentic-jersey-c-1_14.html]http:\/\/www.texasrangersale.com\/authentic-derek-holland-authentic-jersey-c-1_14.html[\/url]Tigers pitcher to target? Who will be the best value, and will he even be on the board come draft day?\n\nThis season will be a huge one for Justin Verlander. At the ripe old age of 35, Verlander is showing that he can still be one of the best pitchers in the game, at least during the second half of the season. Last year, Verlander finished second in AL Cy Young voting and his ERA finished third in the AL. Justin Verlander also finished third with 15 wins and a 2.58 ERA, despite not going a full season.\n\nHis ERA was not as good this year, finishing eighth in AL in a 3.90 ERA, but he hit 16 wins and finished fifth in AL wins. He had eight months rest from the end of the 2014 season to the beginning of Spring training, so he is fresh and ready for his third season with the Detroit. He should be a top 5 pitcher going into this season, and he will most likely finish with around 250 innings and 15 wins. He should get Cy Young votes in the third year of this contract, and his contract will average $ 30 million a season through the 2018 season.","token_len":624,"entropy":[8.0222,3.2251,0.4552,3.0529,0.2711,1.7998,10.2041,3.4203,8.2904,8.6246,0.1324,2.1377,18.8165,7.9622,7.8371,5.7795,4.7722,0.7094,10.6083,1.1693,0.4885,2.5591,2.4596,1.3571,4.8987,0.04,1.1264,3.4297,0.5418,4.3186,12.5849,3.3324,0.0672,3.4473,2.1366,4.0308,9.271,9.9655,0.164,0.7896,0.0005,0.949,0.0009,5.701,2.0997,12.1269,8.1022,14.6039,11.4685,0.0916,0.0496,0.0712,12.5588,0.6544,0.5135,5.1814,2.341,0.0946,3.2697,6.0516,2.9577,0.4936,9.6443,0.285,0.1999,8.4489,0.2753,0.4144,5.503,4.5854,5.1493,3.9518,4.183,4.2681,1.1348,3.5519,5.7817,5.9454,4.3977,0.0055,4.3886,3.9995,5.7647,0.0003,0.5491,0.0017,0.2402,0.2021,0.2068,0.0273,0.0013,0.0054,0.0004,0.0012,0.1257,1.6096,0.0114,0.013,0.0255,0.0055,0.0023,0.0015,0.0018,0.0002,0.0077,0.0112,0.0147,0.0022,0.0007,0.0013,0.0063,0.0143,0.0234,0.132,1.8209,0.0317,0.105,0.021,2.6624,0.094,0.0003,0.0034,0.0008,0.3931,1.0912,0.0733,0.2884,12.0132,5.5711,0.0169,3.8065,8.1317,2.5377,3.6006,3.6172,3.8957,4.0836,2.2326,2.9963,1.4207,5.1734,5.6301,4.2926,0.978,1.4178,1.8097,0.9851,2.5744,5.9435,2.701,5.856,5.7121,0.4289,2.4845,3.8164,3.2463,4.9727,2.9209,2.0412,1.846,0.3564,0.1287,2.9859,0.7707,1.9477,0.7584,1.0448,0.4302,0.24,0.7451,1.4773,2.2215,1.5244,1.2227,2.7219,2.6438,3.3708,5.4741,2.046,2.6429,4.3394,2.174,0.7887,0.5044,4.1691,0.0032,0.5729,1.7023,2.0436,3.9683,2.1968,0.6889,3.1759,0.6955,2.1334,1.1746,0.4159,3.6215,2.8104,0.0066,1.8176,5.0122,2.7189,0.0158,5.9403,1.8327,2.0806,4.3069,1.7959,8.1166,3.2431,2.4844,0.3178,2.8259,0.0114,3.0136,1.1108,3.1947,0.8833,7.794,0.6547,0.2345,0.8249,0.0938,2.3502,5.2087,0.2366,2.0291,0.2678,0.7091,0.0745,5.6887,0.0658,2.1792,3.9545,5.107,2.6143,1.0428,1.988,3.4344,7.8192,0.0021,3.3256,2.7088,3.2833,4.5938,4.7842,0.8707,1.3263,2.9895,3.9666,1.8035,0.3719,2.2476,5.7516,1.3323,3.8506,0.3125,2.7291,0.0024,2.2181,4.899,3.9432,2.8504,0.6377,2.6521,4.1253,1.8836,3.4555,4.3684,0.498,4.5108,5.084,1.3286,0.9263,1.2993,0.0002,4.6208,5.8892,1.6122,7.5648,5.4623,3.283,5.7251,7.0226,2.5279,7.6033,1.2921,4.7276,0.1016,4.8183,4.7662,10.335,2.1854,0.4215,5.5684,1.4228,1.7793,5.0642,1.7648,0.4296,5.2679,2.279,7.8724,3.5285,7.7978,0.1692,0.0285,0.0548,0.0005,0.2319,0.0007,6.1837,0.1433,5.6271,0.5883,10.3601,0.0131,0.0092,0.0274,2.5852,0.0408,0.0162,5.8272,3.6154,0.0116,4.1526,3.2606,0.4044,0.0942,2.0603,0.0493,0.0102,0.569,0.0045,0.0393,0.7325,0.2716,0.4912,0.1088,4.2154,0.1938,0.035,2.7019,1.6761,0.0001,0.0021,0.0007,0.0063,0.0001,0.0026,0.0126,0.0037,0.0003,0.0003,0.0029,0.0071,0.0023,0.0007,0.0029,0.0009,0.0005,0.0014,0.0003,0.0005,0.0005,0.0004,0.0043,0.0004,0.0008,0.0007,0.0012,0.0009,0.0051,0.001,0.0031,0.0027,0.004,0.0009,0.3615,0.0101,0.1221,5.1089,2.1989,3.7532,7.7653,8.3566,5.7961,5.8806,2.2851,1.6807,1.6064,3.0956,5.4572,4.9722,2.1767,3.822,2.5663,6.6181,1.3911,3.1649,0.822,4.4204,7.9,4.4709,0.3105,0.2549,2.7202,0.0002,4.1937,3.6709,3.7128,0.7615,2.3844,3.6207,2.7614,0.1949,6.5557,0.4116,0.0002,0.9819,5.4663,2.4464,5.3992,0.9122,0.0105,0.0249,3.3107,0.2524,0.8389,0.0001,1.2391,6.6576,2.9938,0.1693,1.2256,1.7688,1.6468,3.1409,0.0436,0.0513,0.7833,1.4455,0.1744,0.645,0.3601,2.2023,4.4515,0.411,4.8551,0.8141,4.2181,0.0399,0.0607,0.2946,0.2109,0.1724,5.4904,0.809,0.5993,1.0288,0.0005,3.4654,2.398,0.4451,4.3508,1.6105,0.0004,0.1389,1.6279,4.6223,2.1788,6.7013,2.6863,1.3543,0.5502,0.9672,0.5487,7.5164,1.7576,0.0013,3.6146,2.479,1.579,4.7108,4.7414,1.7552,1.1212,2.7856,1.5398,0.0071,4.6205,0.1063,2.2156,5.0783,2.6049,4.9802,4.5624,0.6525,0.1866,1.1153,1.7818,0.0002,5.1976,2.955,1.7321,4.1456,2.6131,1.3659,4.0095,0.5696,0.8886,4.9182,4.6536,0.3933,2.5113,3.6101,6.0327,5.748,0.5914,4.7231,0.1576,1.3309,1.276,1.269,5.1131,5.3792,6.9326,0.8581,4.6721,3.0358,0.6271,2.3587,6.9358,1.0631,1.7508,3.0005,5.717,7.5338,6.6387,2.6808,1.5395,4.2876,0.0188,0.7736,2.9491,0.172,2.129,1.7597,1.9496,0.005,5.9293,3.7967,1.4018,2.2411,1.1705,2.1174,7.9181,3.8066,0.505,1.3122,3.1283,4.2664,1.3969,2.8447,0.1628,4.6032,11.4554,2.2568,3.8283,0.915,1.9836,2.4146,3.0069,2.7418,6.4916,0.3249,2.6119,0.7179,1.1661,1.5132,2.0434,1.956,5.1657,0.1958,4.4281,2.3998,4.8777,5.8302,0.921,3.4582,5.3197,1.7571,0.677,2.5084,2.386,3.9715,9.6361,0.0096,2.8761,2.3012,1.5328,4.9503,2.8866,0.4932,3.9377,1.4731,1.0522,1.3291,3.1277,4.1565,1.3752,7.6057,1.2144,6.2199,0.4731,2.2107,1.3102,5.4334,1.5202,3.257,0.4718,0.2083]}
{"id":1374,"ended":true,"length":569,"text":"Noel Murray of The A. V. Club was generally favorable to the episode, giving it a B +. He wrote, `` Much like Fringe fan favorite'The Arrival'( not reviewed ), [ the episode] plays itself as an extended dream sequence that's just kind of, well, pretty. It's good while it lasts, and probably good for anyone with a strong emotional reaction to the idea of a father being abducted for an unknown purpose; the problem is that not a lot else has happened for a while now, and nothing else seems very likely to happen very soon.... While the plot is by no means simple, there are a couple of moments in'Absolution' that will probably keep viewers satisfied long after the shock of Broyles' disappearance has worn off.''\n\nZack Handlen of The A. V. Club rated the episode a C- :\n\nI've really gotten a kick out of the \"paint-by-numbers\" nature of Fringe and its ability to do so many things so well. But what it can't do is be all things to all people. On the upside, though, it can at least do some things really well, like this week's Absolution. At first glance, the plot seems simple: Walter and Peter are chasing a lead on the abduction of William Broyles as part of their quest to unravel an interdimensional conspiracy, but before they can take action, the baddies capture Walter in order to save a hostage named Elisabeth Moss ( who bears an unfortunate resemblance to William Broyles of the X-Men comics). But to their credit, writers J.H. Wyman ( a Fringe veteran ) and Joe Weisberg ( who has brought his own sci-fi conspiracy to Fringe before with the aforementioned Arrival ) find ways of incorporating the rest of Fringe's world-building into the episode's climax. While there are times where things get a bit overly cute and the dialogue can feel like dialogue from another show, the writers do a good job of weaving together the different aspects of this story with the larger themes of the show. It even features a cool sequence in the FBI's control room as they try to figure out where William Broyles is taken--if they hadn't already established that the building contains some sort of interdimensional portal, I probably wouldn't have believed it. But it's all part of an overall solid episode that ends with a nice payoff, even if--much like Fringe fan favorite The Arrival--it doesn't exactly advance Fringe in a dramatic way.... I'll admit that I've gotten rather tired of the \"evil FBI guy\" concept here, but David Strathairn makes it work so well that I'm kind of afraid of what they'll do with another FBI bad guy.... It's a good episode and the fact that Peter and Walter have each experienced a dreamlike version of the same narrative isn't a big deal. But after a couple more episodes like this, you start to hope they'll be able to do something a little different.","token_len":624,"entropy":[8.0317,7.7321,4.352,3.0782,6.196,1.1689,6.4198,0.1094,0.8365,4.4493,8.1471,6.2108,0.5626,1.1657,10.174,0.9745,5.7393,1.111,1.0664,5.0936,7.4682,4.5839,3.087,3.9204,1.7791,7.5736,12.9003,3.8202,8.2451,2.1679,7.7289,4.662,8.4907,7.4681,10.0935,0.0261,2.3418,7.1737,9.3555,9.759,5.8383,6.0794,7.5186,2.1674,2.6336,6.6892,5.547,2.4282,2.4743,4.5197,6.5496,0.8656,2.8123,3.6534,4.0337,5.1138,0.0044,5.182,2.0075,0.3466,4.8848,2.8961,1.6983,0.5147,5.3921,8.1038,0.3108,0.3111,1.1528,1.4612,5.9165,4.8829,2.2061,5.2425,3.4681,0.7929,4.1639,4.4919,3.4144,0.3671,1.4506,5.0269,0.3261,2.3542,7.1022,3.2128,4.1776,4.8962,4.1626,3.2251,0.8738,4.7248,2.6458,6.4777,0.5791,0.7453,5.7217,3.9037,0.9917,6.2358,3.1858,2.331,4.6978,2.0485,1.1112,3.6731,1.326,0.943,5.5405,4.4704,3.1688,4.3102,3.1646,0.8646,0.4348,6.2566,0.4367,5.5321,6.607,1.6452,3.3766,1.3619,7.8402,0.5708,0.0005,5.0915,0.5288,2.5181,1.1675,1.9925,1.9643,0.5711,3.7046,2.214,9.9157,12.5957,1.8495,0.8329,1.3633,4.23,2.9619,3.7666,4.2674,6.7241,5.2777,0.3501,0.681,8.8579,1.7944,9.7772,6.3662,0.717,3.5417,2.2418,0.8238,0.1315,2.406,2.9701,0.0068,7.3783,2.8458,8.6157,6.4399,2.1652,1.7992,2.7996,0.0022,0.1312,0.0023,0.006,4.5394,0.7714,0.1395,2.528,2.2624,3.383,9.5478,1.9961,0.0001,4.8267,3.2297,5.6425,5.2236,2.3891,1.8044,0.0124,0.0029,2.0888,5.475,6.902,5.3523,3.0416,1.4367,0.0034,0.449,0.0311,0.1752,4.2052,0.0291,5.7409,0.0035,3.3566,1.9144,5.8793,0.0229,4.5502,1.8144,3.0445,0.7656,4.2778,1.4737,0.9152,4.6359,3.9962,3.6839,4.6299,0.3731,0.1529,0.4104,4.2314,5.5202,3.6137,0.203,0.1345,0.0963,0.6631,5.5547,1.0922,6.3717,0.1769,3.4653,0.1024,1.4904,3.127,4.6254,0.08,3.1067,1.4702,1.8368,5.6636,0.6038,1.7902,3.2912,5.1308,6.2237,0.1733,11.3246,0.0015,2.0899,5.4295,2.5379,1.0382,0.2633,1.6954,4.0569,2.0806,4.029,2.2973,6.7778,2.5147,6.5592,1.4433,6.0715,1.419,8.609,2.7664,1.9508,5.3909,0.2072,6.9433,4.5181,0.0023,5.5725,1.6475,0.0016,2.345,2.2828,0.5838,6.122,4.0077,6.4521,1.5151,1.6792,3.0908,1.3248,4.8562,0.9169,0.8563,4.776,2.4532,0.3751,2.1953,6.7602,3.5432,7.2455,3.7908,3.0187,4.5893,0.0165,3.2508,3.1793,5.9806,4.4909,5.9113,2.3684,0.0676,5.6768,2.3428,7.7283,8.5046,3.5307,6.5454,0.1237,0.0208,3.8984,1.0478,0.001,6.5006,1.1612,6.4605,0.1843,0.9682,6.1304,2.2299,3.8457,4.6551,3.7679,2.9644,0.0685,10.0608,5.0496,0.6296,3.7383,0.0071,4.246,0.7479,2.6064,6.5094,9.4162,0.0054,4.2887,1.7469,0.0279,4.9248,4.9349,0.9622,0.7428,0.1202,4.0362,2.7138,6.1024,2.3409,1.9263,5.4095,0.0319,0.0004,10.3492,2.314,1.8164,0.0012,4.7773,5.4598,1.793,5.6101,9.0194,0.0022,0.6326,5.2712,4.4395,2.9407,4.5583,1.5814,6.7959,0.0189,5.2635,0.0024,0.5339,4.2898,2.1173,0.1528,1.3498,0.6099,2.8625,2.5428,6.8329,0.593,4.543,3.1633,1.0414,5.1627,1.3536,4.0911,1.9305,1.4593,1.8161,6.5907,8.0107,2.1287,2.8413,4.7405,3.6051,2.36,2.6086,6.9015,3.7034,3.459,3.173,0.4587,1.6036,4.8176,3.4335,1.1657,1.8185,0.0069,0.5324,4.7403,1.8677,1.2269,4.4387,3.3874,0.1313,3.0993,2.3317,3.4245,1.4595,4.6931,3.0299,0.716,1.6805,2.07,0.8843,2.8332,6.3039,5.4425,1.1446,6.3191,5.4124,2.4938,3.0726,9.793,1.4255,9.0686,0.0284,5.2013,3.7438,2.0542,0.0654,2.0775,0.0095,3.5671,3.0363,0.9924,0.0017,1.038,6.5848,4.7759,5.8759,1.7437,6.1619,0.0008,2.4805,6.4471,1.0619,2.544,6.7642,5.0166,3.4584,0.7032,0.0009,5.9185,0.2696,2.5203,1.129,4.6369,5.7663,0.3606,0.0006,0.315,4.9579,1.1687,1.041,3.4053,2.5539,0.8849,3.3121,3.1777,0.0049,4.0851,2.2264,4.7171,2.1601,0.962,6.039,0.8261,1.2304,3.8062,4.4412,2.0147,3.34,0.3213,8.5157,6.4195,0.3606,3.475,0.0041,7.9249,1.0223,2.7054,0.8646,0.0013,0.7062,1.5708,2.2477,0.0005,4.3106,7.308,3.442,0.0027,2.9672,2.7526,5.4863,0.2262,8.032,3.7258,2.8297,2.2727,1.0714,0.6468,2.9167,3.675,5.7128,3.2499,0.1173,1.9162,3.5155,8.6168,8.1602,4.2249,0.8408,5.0676,4.3199,0.8858,0.9807,8.8068,5.9567,0.9934,0.072,0.0003,5.4328,1.5586,1.8763,5.0859,0.3616,1.4018,0.5581,1.3622,5.9361,0.0025,6.415,2.6999,4.7442,5.3694,1.2021,0.5048,0.8882,7.1393,8.9388,7.1054,0.1348,5.9701,3.9031,0.533,1.9008,2.421,0.8924,2.6919,3.4626,4.7602,0.0756,7.0476,1.8101,0.3644,2.3039,6.0004,6.871,1.8167,7.0562,3.4152,4.6601,0.0162,1.3094,2.021,7.5445,5.5327,0.0005,1.8778,1.6627,0.3777,1.3503,2.2011,5.4072,2.3977,2.2473,2.172,0.8425,4.4137,1.0214,0.8275,4.0181,3.1915,0.1934,6.6962,3.5033,1.275,3.6494,0.4851,0.0031,2.6753,1.0124,4.4309,0.3433,1.6084,1.3112]}
{"id":3785,"ended":true,"length":580,"text":"On February 21, Boyle gave notice of a resolution to expropriate the rights of the A & GW and build the line directly. He asserted that the government had guaranteed to the A & GW rights on the line between Albany and Albany, and a separate claim had been filed, the exact details of which, Boyle argued, could not be communicated in open court, so he was only presenting \"general grounds of a bill of expropriation.\" The day after the hearing, a special joint committee from both houses, composed of members from the Committee on Highways, William Smith (R-Camperdown and President of the Committee on Public Works), Stephen Roper (D-Pleasant Valley), Robert T. Livingston (D-Schoharie), Edward M. Hale (R-Binghamton), and Nicholas B. Biddle (D-Albany), was appointed to investigate the issue further. The committee held a public hearing on March 13th at the Capitol in Albany, the meeting being adjourned in order to have a fuller hearing in the committee room. That meeting adjourned without resolution pending the arrival of the committee in New York City for a full hearing on March 19th, during which time the state's attorney and counsel for the A & GW would present their positions; Boyle presented his arguments. The next day, March 20th, the committee held a meeting in their apartment on the 17th floor at the Hotel Astor at which they learned that the dispute between the state and the A & GW over who would construct the West Shore Railroad between Lake George and White River Junction was still unresolved. The committee expressed to Boyle that they believed the A & GW had a good case, since the law clearly states that the railroad shall be built from Albany east to the Hudson. Boyle argued that the law does not state that it shall be made from Albany west to the Hudson, and that a law enacted in 1856 had given the state the right to expropriate the A & GW if the line was not constructed to the Hudson River. He pointed to a section of state law which gives power to any railroad company to construct its own line if the government failed to do so. Boyle then made a special reference to a letter between Governor Tilden and Robert Purvy, General Superintendent of the Great Northern Railroad in which it was stated that as long as construction of the West Shore Railroad was not completed to the Hudson, the Great Northern Railroad would be compelled to build the line itself. In response to an argument made by Henry F. Cramer that there was no power for the state to expropriate the railroad and build it itself on the grounds that it was not completed to the Hudson, Attorney General James Gordon Clark asserted that that was not the case, since the government had \"an entire right to complete the work it undertakes.\" Boyle then gave notice of the expropriation bill, which was expected to be voted on by the full House March 29th. The passage of the bill would terminate the controversy and enable the government to carry out its promise to the A & GW.","token_len":624,"entropy":[8.2658,3.8109,0.2946,11.4768,5.7488,6.9959,1.219,2.585,7.7033,1.3364,8.5065,2.3699,0.0044,0.9766,7.9062,0.1692,1.9348,7.3236,9.3659,14.5705,5.0238,6.3375,2.6824,8.7293,5.7913,6.5515,2.4657,7.4671,0.3125,1.001,3.955,1.4553,8.7396,2.6519,0.9091,1.6389,0.7774,0.1385,6.6534,4.5985,1.0249,3.5979,6.0258,7.4295,0.3237,3.4169,2.2027,1.124,5.5375,4.8735,4.8144,2.3214,0.3458,1.8331,3.9674,4.0602,6.0144,3.295,0.1974,0.0099,4.9542,3.8046,3.9521,0.0876,2.464,0.4534,0.0646,5.4329,4.2832,5.07,0.3943,2.5777,3.0939,1.4922,2.7271,5.8749,5.8804,3.2239,6.2624,4.8197,3.0831,4.4599,7.7907,1.289,7.316,0.0002,0.0093,1.0519,2.3557,6.3832,0.7175,1.0139,2.986,0.4772,3.2089,4.8475,6.6894,1.2705,4.7076,1.9254,1.6248,3.1685,2.433,0.2003,3.5875,1.8259,1.2375,6.5304,0.4716,7.44,0.1381,0.7236,9.3535,6.3007,2.7776,3.2127,0.6372,6.5289,7.8812,5.7424,5.5339,7.7871,1.068,0.2456,3.1456,0.1399,2.5584,1.1685,0.4568,6.294,4.1582,5.3068,0.3883,1.9463,0.0787,4.2587,3.5328,0.0411,4.8584,0.5762,4.0822,4.5036,0.9316,8.2431,0.1935,0.8112,0.0077,8.3932,2.4547,0.0099,0.6757,5.0309,2.5633,0.0677,7.6455,0.1669,1.3891,0.0099,3.8613,2.8294,2.1917,0.4257,1.2334,6.5011,3.2173,0.1335,4.7353,4.2341,0.1096,0.6264,0.0059,5.2191,0.1664,0.0497,1.4155,3.2319,2.3081,0.6028,2.996,0.6285,2.6299,5.7607,0.3175,1.8385,1.3473,4.3324,1.253,2.2445,0.1285,0.7752,2.3916,3.6608,4.6056,2.8414,1.9281,3.4071,2.991,1.378,0.9511,4.263,4.4906,3.2521,3.5122,0.0017,5.0065,1.5553,0.1384,5.0303,1.6044,4.9956,3.2493,3.6833,0.833,6.7711,2.2685,0.5268,5.7896,3.9116,4.7553,0.0009,4.0459,3.6135,6.8541,1.5002,6.4504,0.0315,1.0053,2.6373,3.6518,4.1771,0.3061,1.4149,2.8271,1.628,3.6492,0.9569,1.8748,3.5234,2.368,0.255,2.0532,4.9346,0.0433,1.5558,1.0599,5.1295,2.805,2.162,4.4404,4.4297,0.7039,0.3317,1.5051,0.6919,0.0912,4.4517,2.8581,0.7165,5.7609,6.2956,4.0832,3.6914,1.1653,3.5529,3.4103,1.7715,4.5115,0.0898,0.3992,1.7971,1.4123,0.1998,0.073,1.0668,1.9452,2.2658,0.4414,2.4635,1.4251,5.4161,7.3079,1.9119,1.1491,4.6472,0.0147,1.2233,3.7528,1.0095,6.6985,5.5659,1.524,3.2608,5.2028,1.9188,4.9896,0.5203,1.0187,6.7972,2.3706,0.3897,3.1472,0.524,0.8594,0.329,0.2953,0.0096,4.3885,5.8581,1.8991,3.8704,0.1725,7.3382,5.9154,5.6369,4.371,7.1868,5.3642,0.0738,6.7259,2.3034,6.351,1.3897,2.7704,1.5257,0.531,1.5276,1.9885,6.0501,7.0907,2.1045,1.1332,1.5661,3.1328,1.4985,1.7735,0.1458,0.0077,1.5683,2.779,4.829,1.864,1.5052,5.4812,1.2709,5.9696,4.831,3.5578,0.2377,1.5367,4.059,5.0704,0.7984,1.0403,3.8366,4.0786,7.2954,0.8594,2.7802,4.2464,3.567,2.1206,3.0111,0.184,0.9315,3.7936,3.6973,0.0311,4.1649,0.5292,3.1831,2.7078,0.2161,5.5353,2.7137,1.3945,1.7511,0.2038,0.5921,0.5711,0.8193,1.1503,1.0267,3.9426,4.8132,4.1301,1.339,1.9343,4.5347,3.9186,4.53,0.6517,2.1417,1.5235,0.7316,0.1748,7.4283,0.0,0.0026,0.677,2.5148,0.125,0.0067,6.586,1.6844,3.9558,1.256,2.2183,1.8855,3.2761,0.9544,3.0395,2.9257,0.7095,2.6515,3.3562,1.9683,1.7304,3.7838,0.1883,4.0875,0.4441,1.7053,4.7978,4.7903,0.1686,4.9114,5.7053,1.2954,0.3306,2.3426,4.1587,1.3074,0.8974,4.4692,1.6285,5.3113,6.945,0.0467,3.3996,0.1089,1.0144,1.7603,3.8517,3.7927,1.0768,5.8112,4.6301,0.0283,2.0093,4.6978,6.8308,2.9899,5.3945,3.6908,0.0013,0.478,6.7732,10.2815,8.1647,1.0983,7.9782,3.6291,0.1101,0.5416,7.0215,3.4979,0.6037,3.8839,2.6916,4.1702,0.719,1.1349,0.1583,5.9271,2.7588,0.0047,6.0691,0.9951,0.1687,1.6771,0.1059,0.9907,1.0674,1.8433,2.0851,5.2229,0.1058,0.2782,1.7216,0.861,5.6109,0.025,0.6232,0.6243,1.6579,5.1608,0.0646,1.7712,0.9807,0.5934,5.0273,0.7603,3.1542,2.2379,0.5458,5.4025,3.3275,2.9084,0.1822,8.6322,4.3071,0.3806,5.0943,3.1488,3.1891,3.4005,0.4953,0.5529,5.8331,3.8975,0.5996,1.6603,0.0816,1.1281,0.0,0.0006,0.2828,3.8369,3.7378,5.073,1.0828,5.5132,3.1216,0.5409,5.4219,0.3742,1.1394,0.7813,1.5873,5.2998,0.87,0.0266,0.1013,0.9196,8.0735,0.386,4.2361,8.5989,6.1304,5.073,0.195,5.1895,1.3092,1.1222,0.9664,0.4265,1.1554,3.5128,0.8612,3.8069,0.7643,4.5106,5.0249,5.3693,1.5332,0.6344,6.6449,0.6859,4.9814,5.4156,5.3893,0.0005,1.9091,2.8239,2.7131,4.7266,1.3765,0.5081,1.3307,6.1614,0.004,0.0438,5.3221,2.3453,1.2755,1.3567,5.7573,0.2205,0.6149,4.2442,0.4436,1.2904,0.2782,3.9759,1.6706,6.6334,4.1099,0.0808,0.7567,1.4014,5.6247,0.1315,0.3269,0.3492,3.4899,7.1431,0.7076,6.2389,2.0369,5.0583,0.3421,3.5158,0.0826,5.4231,0.9559,0.8445,5.2227,0.4268,1.7526,1.791,0.1125,0.01,1.668]}
{"id":518,"ended":true,"length":551,"text":"In late September, a tropical wave persisted in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. The low @ - @ pressure area later became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on the evening on September 30. The first advisory on Tropical Storm Lenny was released by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) while the system was located about 500 km (311 mi) northeast of the Cabo Verde islands (see map below ).\n\nShortly after beginning to organize, the system slowly gained a well-defined center, and at 1200 UTC on October 1, the NHC estimated that Lenny had reached tropical storm intensity while centered about 990 km (590 mi) northeast of the Cabo Verde islands. The storm quickly became stronger as it continued on a northwest course, and as its center passed to the northwest of the islands, it intensified into a tropical hurricane on October 3. The hurricane crossed a ridge to the southwest of the Cabo Verde islands and turned toward the northeast, and at 1200 UTC on October 4, the NHC upgraded Lenny to a full-fledged hurricane while the system was centered about 925 km (580 mi) south-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. Later that day, the hurricane\u2019s eye expanded and Lenny reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km\/h). During the next day, the cyclone began to weaken as it passed over the Cape Verde Islands, and as the hurricane entered warmer temperatures and drier air, it began to turn to the southeast. Later on October 4, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and eventually became extratropical over Portugal the following day.\n\nThere were no reports of fatalities or significant damage as a result of the storm in the region. However, Lenny had significant impact in the Lesser Antilles, where sustained winds of up to 74 mph (120 kph) were reported on St. Kitts, and the hurricane forced the cancellation of all flights departing for the United States out of Fort-de-France. There were also reports of minor to moderate damage in Puerto Rico as a result of Lenny, and in the Dominican Republic as a result of Frances, though it is unknown whether Lenny caused any damage or injuries. However, while the hurricane was in the vicinity of the Cabo Verde Islands, two men on a tourist catamaran reportedly took shelter at a safe location and escaped safely while the boat sank. In addition, an offshore fishing vessel sank after being buffeted by strong winds.\n\nTropical Storm Lenny\u2019s location at 11 am central time on October 30, 1974. (Image credit: Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale)\n\nTropical Storm Lenny was the first tropical storm ever named Lenny in the Atlantic basin. Although the name was retired after the 1974 hurricane season, it was one of the final names retired due to an error. Lenny will be replaced by Linus, the last year of the \u201cretired\u201d names in 1979.","token_len":624,"entropy":[7.8253,3.0252,0.4059,3.0461,10.2332,7.6931,9.8476,1.45,0.9649,5.0634,4.7696,1.1786,1.9326,1.69,6.0807,14.8665,7.5287,7.6036,7.1064,7.0185,9.3809,3.6155,6.3992,10.7343,0.8763,4.213,6.6698,0.1428,1.0328,1.7059,1.0021,4.8699,12.5476,1.2295,3.2489,2.8391,3.9376,6.7491,1.4082,3.3841,1.2102,1.581,4.9952,7.2004,3.6227,6.7,0.0959,5.1698,8.0803,1.8372,3.5409,3.2971,1.2417,1.7718,0.6335,0.0064,2.2709,0.3725,0.0059,0.6277,7.6137,1.0509,6.8,0.7162,5.7367,3.4151,4.4438,1.9337,2.6865,8.5016,0.654,0.1462,2.0891,0.0424,1.9038,10.3859,0.466,1.8321,0.0032,3.9413,3.0426,3.3393,3.3123,1.1614,6.6995,1.4938,0.2479,6.4724,0.5479,6.1088,2.2313,7.3592,1.2037,0.9319,2.9984,5.6907,4.9437,2.7234,6.6221,0.2433,1.6151,4.356,2.3773,2.6748,4.491,5.8713,0.0373,1.9708,1.814,1.6854,0.6955,1.2459,3.644,0.0071,6.1958,0.8728,3.358,0.0199,2.1975,3.1161,5.347,1.0691,4.6309,7.6842,5.5967,3.3149,5.0656,3.2771,0.3607,0.3755,5.6484,0.0058,0.7069,1.3028,0.0346,0.9464,1.4117,0.0095,0.0068,0.0034,0.3326,0.5422,1.5298,3.9851,5.4679,3.2111,5.0523,2.6204,0.8884,3.2163,4.8754,3.2199,6.0959,5.5928,1.7177,1.6879,3.8057,3.6376,2.0774,4.6816,4.7276,0.8027,2.6895,2.4216,0.4546,3.3918,0.6158,1.1695,4.1892,3.4961,0.4477,1.5522,3.2342,3.3771,1.0488,1.8275,0.448,1.7468,2.9699,7.5394,3.1438,4.8105,3.745,0.4579,2.3332,1.1067,0.3454,2.1423,0.0021,0.0016,0.003,0.2881,1.989,5.322,3.4462,0.4828,2.9076,1.4003,2.4574,3.5049,2.5288,0.0066,1.3476,0.4142,0.7478,0.4574,0.7666,0.704,0.0008,7.0829,2.7323,0.0018,0.7004,1.1446,7.5108,1.2258,1.5379,1.9132,6.1925,1.7447,0.7672,1.0494,1.3719,0.693,2.0388,4.6242,0.0148,0.006,3.7759,0.0005,0.0803,4.6418,2.4016,1.4686,0.3574,0.024,0.2304,6.4012,0.303,0.0025,0.4553,0.3344,6.6641,1.1863,0.6427,0.1267,0.7882,2.5594,17.4488,8.7493,3.1061,6.8792,5.6636,2.9962,7.5464,0.0073,3.7159,2.6256,3.9461,0.5499,4.6043,5.3274,1.257,0.1382,0.3181,4.5255,4.4351,0.1669,4.1418,0.6639,0.039,0.0093,1.1702,4.117,0.719,2.3627,3.8342,0.3742,0.7677,6.6446,0.1724,3.6345,0.4589,2.4133,2.7243,0.3844,3.169,2.2275,0.4793,2.4501,0.0932,0.0021,2.2472,1.2054,1.1377,3.1237,1.6112,1.9909,4.3621,8.0434,3.5491,2.1255,4.1794,0.0025,1.7795,0.3916,0.7609,2.3236,0.2581,3.9309,2.7205,1.8786,2.1297,0.9846,5.7501,2.1554,1.1514,2.4266,0.0876,0.6133,1.3891,5.1385,1.518,0.8384,0.944,0.5186,2.366,4.8759,2.9406,9.2654,0.0864,0.0132,0.0413,5.9971,9.0928,8.3548,0.8897,0.2021,0.4689,0.9886,0.0002,5.7885,1.1382,1.9638,2.3863,0.2382,4.5286,1.2724,4.9818,0.4529,4.2269,1.0993,0.0461,0.0025,0.6085,1.8243,3.7732,1.4195,3.9952,0.8373,2.2537,0.008,4.2747,0.0308,3.8399,5.9468,3.2292,2.3735,1.2883,10.7025,0.1359,0.2567,0.0235,1.5793,2.32,6.6276,0.0464,1.1475,2.1866,0.004,6.3948,0.3689,0.0371,3.3379,2.7636,0.0439,0.2241,1.1407,1.597,2.1706,10.0498,0.2925,5.204,0.002,2.1346,2.1658,2.3611,5.1685,7.0521,1.818,4.785,0.0105,3.286,2.9752,6.1262,4.1293,1.2011,4.7452,0.157,7.3519,0.0142,6.37,7.8864,5.7894,0.0079,2.3778,1.0333,4.4615,0.425,2.4328,0.5084,0.1782,3.4727,6.4921,0.1146,1.1267,2.0175,5.0469,0.1799,3.6813,1.0719,0.0471,0.0323,2.0163,0.0089,1.9075,1.4665,3.1315,1.1374,2.3852,0.0111,2.3523,0.4636,0.1003,0.0062,12.4698,4.6869,5.1891,3.1107,1.3036,1.5952,1.5292,3.3296,0.0122,2.0417,1.4088,1.4777,2.6411,2.824,0.4717,4.6141,0.0084,5.2398,1.3656,1.8025,1.4791,3.4161,0.9228,3.8809,0.1202,1.2948,4.7429,0.0098,0.0027,0.0041,2.1726,0.3366,5.5276,5.6767,4.1598,1.6371,6.2926,13.4261,0.8545,0.0001,6.0817,5.2063,3.1846,2.3724,1.2779,5.8586,2.6789,2.9813,4.2285,6.3396,5.6312,1.7543,4.6062,3.9967,0.4723,3.392,2.0784,0.3312,3.8312,5.1707,4.3765,0.978,3.9983,3.5942,2.6065,5.6858,0.0062,0.1884,6.4473,0.206,1.7492,0.7878,0.0002,5.3381,0.3442,0.0185,0.7261,0.5522,0.0434,8.8548,0.5507,1.7273,5.1342,3.6363,3.6875,3.9386,8.9423,1.6361,1.344,0.5133,4.5007,0.9011,6.8196,1.4404,2.1861,4.0492,2.0283,0.0494,5.5067,6.5467,1.3919,0.9716,2.5301,1.3299,10.5145,7.1931,5.63,2.0866,0.2714,0.0002,3.2459,0.016,0.0025,0.3471,0.104,0.011,1.4227,2.3782,1.6662,0.4792,0.6489,4.5353,3.1222,8.2919,0.2305,2.7153,0.6022,2.5124,3.1187,0.8784,4.0172,1.5894,1.1915,1.4151,8.3662,3.1022,1.5331,5.4193,0.6585,0.4373,0.2082,1.6434,1.0624,4.7412,0.0507,0.4778,6.4081,1.7604,7.4887,5.0755,0.008,4.5841,3.9373,3.3216,2.8886,0.0413,6.6299,1.0104,4.9317,0.3875,11.4175,4.8901,2.2149,1.8384,2.5177,7.2898,0.3537,0.4117,10.5555,5.6358,10.0354,0.9507,2.4713,7.5501,6.4796,2.8713,5.0583,0.3911]}
{"id":1100,"ended":false,"length":515,"text":"Tristan ran nine times in the first half of 1880, winning four races worth about \u00a3 1 @, @ 900 @. @ beginning his career with a second place in the Lincoln Plate on June 19, 1880. The following week, he won the three-mile Queen, the biggest mile-race run on the turf at that time, in time record, and in the process won \" the honor of being the first horse sired by the thoroughbred American thoroughbred champion, Unbridaled.\"1,2 He did nothing for the rest of the year, but in August ran three good races and, after some rest, opened his campaign again early in 1881. Starting only three times in the first part of the season, he won the two mile Gold and the two-mile Diamond. With all those four races he won nearly one-quarter of a million pounds \u2014 about \u00a3 25,000 ($1,000,000 in 2012), more than any other horse or jockey that year.\n\nAlthough most of his earnings came from 1881, all of his later races were also highly profitable. On May 31, 1882, he won the three-mile Apsley Stakes. Then, at the end of the month he won four races in a row: the three-mile Lillie, Silver, and Gold, as well as the Queen. All of them were run at six furlongs or farther, at distances to which he was very well suited. In June he ran seven times (losing once), and won five races. Later in August, he ran thrice and won all three races.\n\nThis form was then a mile and a quarter or more [5\u20136 furlongs], the distance of the Derby, and the mile-and-an-eighth mile of most of the top two-mile races at Royal Ascot. These distances were all in the same range as those run by other horses, but the form was less well respected than the form for the one-and-three-fourths miles [2,400\u20132,500m]. Indeed, many of the top trainers said that in the one-and-a-half mile [4,200\u20134,500m] they often liked to be able to sit in the saddle and ride their own horses, which they could not do over a mile and a quarter [6,000m].\n\nIn three-quarters of a mile [1,200\/1,300 meters], 1,200 meters or more [5\u20136 furlongs]\n\nIn the three-quarters of a mile [1,200\/1,300 meters], which the form was generally run in, the top three horses (or the top five horses if there were only five runners) ran three times in each race, and there were always a lot of horses running each race. Only five or six horses per race were likely to get into contention for the race. This made the racing easy and made winning almost certain for all the horses.3,4","token_len":624,"entropy":[9.6787,0.9236,10.837,7.6864,1.9482,3.1799,1.8341,2.0758,0.9489,2.5545,13.529,1.2012,4.681,3.0899,5.6437,9.3046,3.2453,2.3892,9.9466,11.6036,7.2996,4.0191,8.5556,4.4477,2.1102,4.4326,12.159,6.4989,0.6314,3.6668,2.0046,6.2647,3.5319,2.9284,1.193,8.9995,7.6867,4.8799,3.7593,3.7224,0.2937,2.245,0.4852,3.1652,3.2233,3.368,1.3123,1.0442,1.1924,0.9658,6.8934,1.5765,5.0756,6.3971,5.9247,2.5525,6.3559,6.0601,3.3613,3.0201,5.4753,3.8645,0.8883,9.7848,1.8437,3.2633,0.1952,1.2367,2.7101,7.3308,8.174,3.8048,2.6512,3.7822,1.763,5.0412,1.7642,7.3741,6.1555,8.4674,0.2947,1.5026,1.0184,0.7882,4.6317,10.6293,4.0095,0.9379,2.3165,10.9429,0.004,7.3247,7.6965,0.0085,4.5143,1.7495,9.3419,6.8374,10.1124,2.1791,7.7421,4.6299,0.9418,3.5477,4.7644,6.8427,2.8111,1.2121,3.5125,0.0033,0.5685,1.4202,0.9006,1.8072,2.3874,3.4079,8.1973,3.5544,7.6596,0.7933,2.8789,4.2914,2.8036,4.7666,5.0497,0.3453,6.9104,1.6916,4.2768,3.8862,6.6427,0.5882,3.5861,1.0208,0.903,7.0461,7.0373,2.7346,2.4058,0.9676,0.9149,1.4382,5.7708,0.0134,0.755,1.4383,0.2725,0.5046,1.4371,1.6675,4.3654,2.7843,7.0616,2.6561,1.371,1.7377,2.3028,0.0722,5.2195,1.6378,5.0746,4.387,3.5527,5.7833,1.1248,2.4554,1.079,6.1345,4.1402,0.7411,2.706,0.1292,2.788,1.6419,1.8599,5.3958,3.1477,1.6461,5.1158,0.4799,0.1288,6.6369,5.7925,0.0625,2.6201,0.5808,0.1389,5.1936,6.8764,5.6699,4.4357,0.1421,2.5266,0.3036,1.4103,5.2408,8.4414,0.1017,5.2124,2.4439,0.2343,2.4244,0.0005,5.3755,4.8203,0.6938,1.1479,5.6787,1.0506,0.1792,6.3666,0.896,1.364,5.4805,1.1856,1.021,4.9961,3.5192,1.2391,3.9381,6.4105,1.9921,0.6333,4.2015,2.3278,3.7345,0.1919,0.6662,1.4234,0.1237,1.0821,1.277,0.7171,3.7318,0.6514,0.0627,7.2645,8.0097,2.5091,6.2997,0.9122,3.3441,4.7778,1.3002,3.739,0.8268,1.3824,0.0022,1.1883,2.8431,3.6844,0.6969,5.5244,0.711,2.7736,2.6365,0.424,4.037,1.2398,3.4337,0.3402,0.0916,5.4814,4.4445,2.1784,1.6849,7.4293,1.2492,0.6318,1.7158,1.5474,3.999,0.0334,0.0047,0.6357,5.7288,1.9569,4.541,1.0879,2.3092,1.2333,4.8652,2.0774,6.0273,7.9247,0.1298,0.1036,2.9564,6.3979,1.8075,3.7398,6.0061,5.4995,3.5407,1.0568,1.9365,4.4507,3.1835,4.1925,0.617,2.4877,4.549,0.9174,2.3483,3.4829,2.2375,5.2611,7.0154,3.3849,6.0262,2.788,1.6553,3.7437,3.2164,0.9697,1.7134,5.9869,1.5424,2.1936,1.8548,0.5433,1.5349,11.4892,0.0229,2.9307,0.3589,4.1809,1.703,1.9467,0.9516,1.8546,0.0002,4.4698,6.2843,3.9261,5.0639,5.2291,9.5695,4.0436,0.406,3.5555,5.2775,1.0904,8.1371,4.8898,6.368,1.3644,4.7968,0.071,0.2233,2.4937,4.3353,3.072,2.6817,1.7219,6.955,1.5048,1.684,1.3053,4.2505,1.4895,3.918,0.0111,5.2532,0.0183,6.6456,0.1614,2.7581,3.0549,8.3802,0.8755,0.3755,6.1144,5.5052,2.9755,0.367,2.4738,3.2195,8.8668,7.229,0.3277,0.8283,4.7042,3.7342,0.7607,4.1719,3.995,1.2067,2.5856,4.2073,2.017,1.7401,3.8772,0.686,4.2995,0.9575,1.3345,1.9793,2.0648,6.497,1.0368,4.6798,3.6099,6.9076,2.4716,1.2019,2.8752,3.7144,1.4563,5.8181,1.3243,4.7153,0.0163,5.4448,0.6395,7.161,1.7,4.1817,4.8059,3.1414,2.2765,6.7346,1.2207,1.3848,0.0012,1.2521,7.2107,1.0705,6.4927,0.1802,3.602,1.0361,0.5484,3.0359,9.9722,5.6553,0.7775,3.9087,1.4468,5.2838,0.337,0.37,0.0079,3.9707,0.0295,0.0053,1.2088,1.5425,3.3118,0.319,2.3372,0.339,0.402,0.0016,1.2051,0.0469,0.599,3.8683,4.7835,8.2573,0.5706,5.2249,2.708,0.0074,7.6827,2.1558,0.9864,2.3963,1.4367,2.5052,3.153,4.4659,0.4361,1.7284,3.3966,2.0661,3.3566,2.6301,0.3748,6.493,2.5764,3.3946,3.5469,0.1555,2.2865,2.1369,3.2836,0.4376,1.1606,2.6739,0.7404,1.5674,0.0001,2.2677,8.0736,2.5395,1.7079,0.2677,1.6545,0.524,0.4514,2.2877,0.0515,2.0257,7.621,2.2826,0.0119,2.6251,7.0848,1.0341,7.1135,0.4747,1.1431,2.7206,3.1157,0.6386,1.6046,3.3992,2.4394,0.8424,0.7244,0.0009,0.0128,0.8892,6.3402,0.0001,1.9673,1.6765,3.065,0.0651,0.7734,1.0615,0.0604,0.0175,0.0961,0.6797,0.005,0.2061,0.0459,0.0519,0.0009,0.0492,0.0464,0.3586,6.3234,4.7998,4.7974,1.7594,4.6596,5.8046,2.2257,0.6161,1.5036,4.1185,2.6706,2.778,3.513,3.635,3.0057,1.6775,2.6966,1.7211,2.6864,2.7083,0.4556,2.7263,1.2647,7.0765,0.7928,3.103,4.3192,1.3308,2.1205,3.5986,3.1398,1.5401,1.7628,4.6089,0.4541,5.694,3.9986,3.3427,0.0991,2.7284,2.8421,5.1846,0.8733,0.5894,5.6703,3.9388,2.4522,0.1753,1.4596,4.135,0.1997,0.6269,6.9495,0.0675,4.1038,2.9203,3.1059,1.2411,0.6301,4.0225,1.2938,3.5348,4.3761,1.4065,5.2057,6.5021,1.8267,5.6419,5.0566,5.8044,5.2531,3.4884,2.3274,1.4429,1.4651,1.2605,6.3681,2.8001,0.0784]}
{"id":2824,"ended":true,"length":498,"text":"From 1848 to 1864, Denmark and the German Confederation fought over control of the two duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Historically, the duchies had been ruled by Denmark since medieval times, but the kingdoms became part of the German Confederation after the Napoleonic Wars. The territory, including what is today the German state of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg, was ceded to Denmark in 1864 after the German Congress of Vienna failed to solve the issue.\n\nThe Danish\u2013Norwegian Border Dispute, also known as the Border Dispute of 1814 and the Border War of 1814\u20131815, occurred between Denmark and her ally Norway over the sovereignty of the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen. Norway won and ceded the island as its last territorial gain as a result of the 1814 conflict.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to seize Pomerania during the Napoleonic Wars, Frederick William I of Prussia entered the Congress of Vienna that laid the foundation for the German Confederation. Once the Congress approved Frederick William's terms, he signed the Act of Mediation regarding the Holy Roman Empire, which allowed him to annex Schleswig and some other duchies to his kingdom in 1806. The treaty was later invalidated by France. Between 1807 and 1813, Frederick William worked to take more territory from the Hanseatic League and Austria before annexing Schleswig in 1848. Under Prussian rule, Schleswig was renamed Holstein (the German word for \"Holstein\") and became an important agricultural and industrial center.\n\nA series of land and sea wars (1812-1814) between Prussia and France ended in the Battle of Friedland. The victory ended the French threat to Prussia's eastward expansion into the Duchies of Prussia, Lithuania, and Posen. In 1849, Napoleon sold the duchies to the newly formed German Confederation and the new duke, Augustus of Brunswick, sought to keep control of the duchies even after his death in 1866. At first, he gained an independent state status under the union of states. The king of Denmark still held over 1,500,000 Danes in the duchies and was allowed to appoint the Landtag (the assembly that would be voted as the duchy's parliament when Schleswig joined Denmark with Denmark's other crown lands ).\n\nThe German Confederation was composed of four independent states that came together in 1848. Since the German Confederation did not have a constitution, its members negotiated the Treaty of Frankfurt in 1849 setting the terms of the union. This treaty gave Austria veto power over the decision to join any states who wanted to withdraw (Austria also acquired Schleswig as a result). The Danish King was also granted limited powers over the people of the duchy of Schleswig.

{"id":655,"ended":false,"length":540,"text":"Following Virginia Tech's kickoff, NC State returned the ball to the 27 @ - @ yard line, where the Wolfpack began the game's first play. That play was a short pass that was intercepted by Tech's Taylor. Tech's leading tackler returned the pick 29 yards to the NC State 19 yard line, setting up a first-and-goal from the eight yard line. But four plays later, Tech's starting quarterback had lost the ball and forced the turnover on downs. Tech's defense, which had allowed just one touchdown in its first two games, held on to the ball for almost eight minutes before punting. On the Wolfpack's only drive of the second quarter, Boyd got NC State on the board with a 9-yard pass to wide receiver. Tech drove to the 20 yard line on its next possession, but quarterbackwas strip- sacked by NC State linebacker. NCSU forced a three-and-out with its next drive, and the redshirt freshman was in again, picking off a deep pass and going 32 yards to the Hokies'11 yard line. On third down, Boyd completed a 21- or 22-yard pass to, cutting and breaking defenders in his wake and giving the Wolfpack its first lead of the game, 14-0. Virginia Tech managed just 14 points in its first two contests, but the Hokies got on the board before halftime thanks to a 37-yard field goal by freshman. But on the opening drive of the second half, Boyd set his personal record, completing passes on nine of 10 attempts and scoring on a seven-yard scramble to complete that series. The senior then added a nine-yard pass toand another eight-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver, each of which helped the Wolfpack put this one away. Boyd completed 24-of-33 passes for 356 yards to lead the Wolfpack, while Gilliam grabbed eight passes for 108 yards. Tech, which outgained NC State 383-317, got two rushing touchdowns from But it was still just a 14-7 lead, and the Tech defense still had life. The Hokies'defense forced a short punt and set up first-and-goal from the two yard line. But Boyd overthrew, and the Hokies'drive stalled. The Wolfpack's defense ended the afternoon by forcing four punts and three turnovers on downs. The Hokies turned the ball over three more times, including another fumble on the final drive which sealed an ugly 17-7 victory for NC State.

{"id":964,"ended":true,"length":500,"text":"Federer struggled with back injuries sustained in March and again in July and saw his ranking drop from No. 2 to No. 6. The 2013 season was the first since 1999 in which the 17-time major champion did not win a single title.\n\nFederer, who turned 37 on Aug. 8, made two comeback appearances this season, including one at Wimbledon that ended in the quarterfinals.\n\nFederer did not defend the Australian Open title he won in January to raise his haul of major trophies to 18, the most for a man in the Open era.\n\nHe and Wawrinka have combined to win four of the past seven majors.\n\nWawrinka had never got beyond the quarterfinals at the All England Club and this year made a quarterfinal run to the semifinals.\n\nWawrinka was seeded No. 3, the highest for an Australian Open men's champ since Lleyton Hewitt was seeded second in 2003.\n\nWawrinka had lost both previous trips to Melbourne Park in the fourth round.\n\nHe beat third-seeded Kei Nishikori in the final last year for his only Grand Slam title and to join Federer and Rafael Nadal as the only players other than Djokovic with multiple major championships.\n\nThis was the first Australian Open final to be preceded by an all-Swiss final since 1949 at Melbourne Park, where there is a statue of Rod Laver and both finals were played under indoor roofs.\n\nIn this one, Wawrinka raced to 6-2, 3-2 at one stage and appeared to be in complete control after serving the second double fault of the match in the 12th game of the third set.\n\nBut Federer suddenly found his game, broke for 4-3 and made two more break points to lead 5-3.\n\nAt the end, he put away a backhand pass, and the match ended with Wawrinka misfiring a forehand volley. No. 8 Grigor Dimitrov beat 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4) to win the Australian Open junior title.\n\nThe 19-year-old Dimitrov's best result in an elite event was reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon.\n\nHe took a couple of years off to play tennis in college and has been working his way up the rankings and into the top 50 for the first time since 2013.\n\nWawrinka has never been past the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event or even a major's fourth round. He didn't lose in that round at the 2013 Australian Open, then made the semifinals at the U.S. Open three weeks later.\n\nIn between, he won his first Grand Slam title at the French Open in 2015.\n\nIn the other half of this year's final four in Melbourne, No. 1 Serena Williams plays No. 7 Garbine Muguruza.","token_len":625,"entropy":[9.9169,9.734,2.3243,6.362,2.6649,6.5613,0.9984,5.1915,2.1256,6.1993,0.826,3.8664,3.446,6.4276,1.4587,7.0994,2.7379,1.9709,2.5261,0.018,2.496,0.4237,0.2798,0.001,2.6138,1.3239,3.0517,6.4912,2.7893,1.35,3.0702,1.8002,3.138,4.1741,4.0195,0.0933,2.0118,6.7083,0.1076,1.9238,5.266,2.3611,4.5987,0.0644,2.8343,0.8243,3.3373,2.6759,0.8088,0.4554,0.0003,6.8115,0.0009,2.7522,0.718,4.9479,3.7767,0.7194,3.5761,0.0045,3.3023,0.1359,4.7102,4.5088,5.6231,0.7446,3.0117,0.5733,1.051,1.9136,2.9851,2.4907,1.68,0.0,3.6289,2.1994,0.6194,3.068,2.3333,0.1044,0.7532,1.7294,0.0002,2.4159,0.0012,5.0457,0.4452,6.2559,2.3288,6.182,0.2529,0.4257,4.9516,0.6039,0.74,5.2765,5.536,5.4198,0.9048,9.701,1.8448,6.6264,2.942,0.9194,4.3661,1.6878,3.5239,1.5074,3.7209,0.9629,4.0899,2.0696,1.4278,4.043,3.4644,0.3739,0.6992,0.0002,2.5056,5.185,5.1141,0.3592,0.0024,0.0,2.5297,4.6025,1.1558,0.992,3.1275,1.7606,0.8841,1.9361,2.6743,2.0827,1.4022,0.654,0.0002,2.0549,0.0275,0.0068,0.0001,3.9797,5.1144,8.8086,5.5179,0.7516,2.3062,0.1237,3.8729,1.3201,5.2688,3.3024,0.2223,2.6107,5.1667,1.3566,5.2414,2.6166,5.9013,0.2092,4.3928,2.2313,2.4345,1.9464,1.2914,0.7111,0.0002,1.9578,0.0185,0.0064,0.0003,2.9381,4.7604,1.4947,0.0023,2.5169,3.2366,3.0124,2.9501,3.4286,2.689,1.7876,0.3107,6.4581,0.0159,5.5491,1.4609,7.0658,3.9979,0.0123,0.0022,0.2552,2.4882,1.7248,5.6927,0.5895,4.252,0.253,0.4495,0.0002,1.4798,0.0131,0.0055,0.0003,3.2447,3.8452,5.4656,4.3738,5.4302,0.032,7.498,6.4879,2.4714,1.351,6.2712,0.0739,1.6549,0.5516,0.0002,2.8978,4.2278,6.8531,0.1727,2.5214,0.0008,7.4068,1.7519,0.0215,0.0025,0.0008,1.2939,0.878,1.813,4.5057,0.9678,3.5347,2.2411,4.6073,3.7528,0.0003,0.6418,2.5938,6.2026,6.7998,4.4576,0.0004,2.9618,4.3443,0.0002,0.0001,1.6946,0.6375,0.4369,1.8075,7.1407,0.0823,4.007,0.0014,0.0002,5.0756,4.3638,3.3799,3.2824,0.8098,0.3505,0.0002,5.3975,2.7531,0.7461,1.166,4.6017,0.0143,2.8579,3.2922,0.6289,8.1508,0.0265,2.4269,3.3746,0.0168,9.2429,0.2617,2.0185,1.778,7.5144,3.0902,5.2736,0.7294,2.1274,2.3915,5.1849,3.9593,0.9806,7.6882,0.2688,7.4914,2.9236,0.0195,3.9701,7.3935,9.2968,1.0972,1.7455,4.7439,9.2369,9.4743,0.4533,0.5605,0.0002,3.921,4.7737,5.4279,0.5171,2.4441,0.0064,0.0032,0.0007,8.4909,1.5177,6.553,0.2897,2.2131,1.8975,2.6642,0.0779,1.7676,4.2872,5.1424,3.7231,1.3631,7.6308,0.7382,1.2099,2.5452,4.9653,0.3223,3.3109,6.8741,2.6779,3.1716,7.1703,8.6583,3.0527,1.0667,2.0557,2.6174,0.6438,5.2804,0.0219,5.8655,1.061,0.411,2.8904,1.4689,0.4758,0.2959,0.0002,3.5635,2.7219,0.0004,7.0881,3.1286,2.931,4.4936,3.2101,8.0569,5.9104,5.0111,1.2911,1.7945,1.7282,4.7225,2.9352,1.7197,5.2988,2.3983,2.2493,4.3569,2.9653,0.0078,1.5994,1.0507,0.3436,0.0002,5.0525,0.7902,1.707,2.6871,2.3406,4.5669,4.6451,2.5767,5.6532,0.5605,3.8021,3.959,3.1387,3.1627,3.8081,2.2743,2.3577,3.4173,0.0061,0.0015,0.0004,10.7187,3.5576,0.0201,2.3453,3.224,0.0068,4.8029,1.8582,6.659,5.7956,3.0221,8.0595,0.0962,0.0022,0.0656,0.026,4.29,11.3066,2.3172,5.6556,0.1112,0.0002,0.0037,0.0015,2.9653,0.0074,1.4068,2.0118,2.4965,0.0085,2.0977,5.0494,2.7808,0.4165,1.5823,3.3943,1.7694,0.0046,1.037,1.2794,0.6953,0.0036,2.0779,0.9476,1.3582,1.1405,0.462,1.4474,0.006,8.5929,1.5298,0.4152,0.3654,0.0003,2.2754,6.2074,0.095,0.3212,0.0258,0.0018,5.464,0.0004,0.0021,4.2448,4.3903,3.5946,2.2024,4.1711,7.9401,2.3426,1.0634,9.4981,0.5634,5.5698,0.2933,1.9871,1.2384,0.0001,1.8349,0.5652,0.0002,2.9237,4.2755,1.9928,5.6807,0.1919,5.6589,0.2581,1.5432,2.654,0.6755,1.8502,6.539,1.6465,3.8542,1.9571,3.2809,3.351,0.0538,1.0315,1.2882,2.4006,4.3933,4.2668,0.4794,1.245,4.0938,2.4278,0.8624,1.6144,0.0028,1.0588,4.1251,0.227,0.356,0.0002,2.9617,0.0247,0.0018,0.0005,2.3973,3.5954,2.5551,6.6472,0.3085,1.025,0.0823,1.9128,1.1066,3.3531,0.0012,3.1773,4.8227,3.9775,2.4888,2.7041,7.7689,7.484,0.873,0.8209,2.2482,5.7508,0.001,3.9793,2.2036,4.2394,4.1143,2.8965,1.5631,4.6038,1.0796,0.0024,1.7135,5.4754,4.6798,1.9639,2.0858,1.4631,0.915,4.5129,0.1551,0.0497,0.0535,0.0082,6.272,2.9082,0.3748,0.5955,0.2664,0.0002,3.0796,7.6784,1.5787,1.1203,2.1518,2.448,0.9639,3.0789,0.0002,0.3563,1.898,1.0125,4.5226,0.0233,1.1892,3.9218,1.3991,0.531,0.0002,2.8572,1.9513,4.9228,3.662,0.4449,2.0511,0.8219,2.1813,3.5362,6.7295,4.9531,2.4415,0.7977,6.7437,0.0035,2.5973,3.8326,0.0057,0.0341,11.3276,3.9604,0.002,3.0158,7.72,2.5205,1.176,0.034,0.0389,0.001,2.1347]}
{"id":82,"ended":true,"length":576,"text":"Devin Townsend was born in New Westminster, British Columbia, on May 5, 1972. Townsend picked up the banjo when he was five, and began playing guitar when he was 12. Townsend began forming his own bands, first as a teenager, and soon developed an interest in the progressive rock genre, later becoming immersed in the heavy metal genre. Townsend's third studio album was an influence of his father, a musician who had grown up in the Kingston, Ontario area and moved to the Vancouver area, working with progressive metal band Stratovarius, and later became a session musician and touring guitarist for rock and metal artists such as Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper. Devin's stepfather was also an up-and-coming local rock band drummer, and influenced him and his brother to play as well. Townsend was introduced to progressive rock musician Paul Gilbert at eighteen, leading to a friendship and mutual respect. Townsend joined the heavy metal band Dream Theater as a guitarist in 1984 at the age of 19, and remained with the band until 1990. Townsend also met guitarist Steve Vai while in Dream Theater, and the two went on to form the supergroup Ziltoid the Omniscient, which first performed and recorded together in 1993. Townsend and Gilbert also took part in a cover band, the Metal Church, which supported the likes of Metallica and Dio during their early tours. Townsend would also go on to record a covers album, the self-titled Metal Church, as well as release his first solo studio album, Deconstruction, in 1994. During his tenure with Dream Theater, Townsend also formed his own side project project, Strapping Young Lad, which released the metal group's first album.\n\nTownsend departed Dream Theater in 1990, and would later take part in the heavy metal bands Dio (as Dio Disciples ) and Devin Townsend Project (DTP ), before releasing his third studio album, Aquarius, on November 18, 1992. Townsend began working with the experimental group Delain as his wife, Janine Johansson, was a member, and the group released their first album in 1994. Townsend has collaborated on several albums with musician Kevin Moore, who has played bass on three of his projects with the Devin Townsend Project, and appeared as a member of Stone Free as well. Townsend would reunite with former members of Dream Theater for an appearance on Metallica's S&M2 album in 2001 and their performance at the Sonisphere festival in London, England in 2003. Townsend would go on to release a seventh studio album, Transcendence, in 2005.\n\nIn 2012 Townsend released Symphony X, a concept album he conceived while touring with Korn.

The Bantams finished the season in a mid table position and had beaten Birmingham 2\u20130 at the St Andrew's in the previous fixture.","token_len":625,"entropy":[7.7604,5.8369,9.5489,8.3671,1.2974,2.117,9.1017,3.3526,5.0862,10.5939,4.7543,5.352,6.8307,2.3757,0.2945,10.7785,1.9907,1.3489,0.0895,0.2848,5.2126,0.6912,6.7608,8.5729,4.8189,3.4008,1.2996,0.9826,5.0114,0.0423,0.0472,3.8199,0.2806,3.3509,6.415,4.0394,4.8013,4.1354,1.3271,0.871,0.4953,0.4285,0.8362,0.3581,0.2473,0.4162,0.5179,0.2441,0.2271,0.1952,10.1824,5.2331,1.5983,0.2775,1.4777,0.0262,0.0108,5.2752,0.55,3.2637,5.1132,1.1724,3.3547,4.5101,0.2548,0.9006,0.0128,0.0108,2.8358,0.3861,1.7024,3.9153,0.158,3.3925,0.2628,1.9477,0.0059,0.0113,3.6638,0.0921,2.2074,2.1477,4.0356,0.4814,2.4946,4.7812,0.1913,1.4369,0.0349,1.5611,0.0115,0.0054,2.6695,0.0283,1.8082,1.0156,0.9883,0.0393,1.314,1.1831,0.1253,0.0566,0.269,0.6726,0.148,5.6129,8.0949,7.6463,0.247,1.3905,0.0259,3.3148,0.0121,0.0057,2.1001,0.0223,1.7996,0.5037,0.4644,0.0691,0.5317,0.3273,0.6681,0.8112,0.3342,0.5717,2.3492,4.6718,0.4845,1.1977,1.5393,3.6167,0.0463,6.0308,0.0005,1.9578,0.3157,0.0166,0.9485,0.0041,0.0047,5.0225,1.8876,5.3204,4.187,0.3883,1.5471,0.1512,0.0312,6.9096,0.0106,0.0037,4.0146,0.7374,6.2853,0.8419,4.5922,0.1573,1.3804,2.6038,6.3601,0.2388,4.0245,0.4152,1.9774,1.7593,1.88,0.1474,2.5973,0.6658,1.7376,0.1983,3.8078,0.4683,2.6142,0.2502,1.2834,0.5644,0.2829,1.0898,1.0462,5.0629,1.488,1.0752,0.0345,1.9215,0.0078,0.0044,3.804,0.4272,1.8681,0.5414,1.9135,0.2066,1.2327,0.113,3.5871,0.1287,1.3317,6.2411,3.4788,0.032,0.0107,1.1623,0.0038,0.0051,3.0462,0.4616,2.3071,5.9893,0.0091,0.9538,0.011,1.8457,0.0061,0.0048,3.0209,2.149,2.4591,0.8573,2.1177,1.063,1.276,0.1676,0.6469,0.7418,0.4241,0.099,2.1288,0.9637,1.5742,0.1861,2.1418,0.6198,1.0782,7.3452,2.1475,0.029,2.2204,0.0077,0.0052,3.5441,1.2568,2.4982,0.1681,1.5598,1.2946,1.5652,0.0202,1.2798,0.4785,0.0841,0.0391,2.7661,0.2363,0.669,9.9802,3.4794,3.8259,1.5021,0.0902,1.7483,0.0077,0.0058,3.122,1.3847,1.5043,0.5216,0.249,0.4384,0.2964,6.2355,0.0051,3.0219,4.2709,3.7899,0.6814,3.6474,4.2827,0.7735,2.1849,2.868,1.2447,3.3037,4.1228,5.0986,0.1961,5.692,1.9823,1.77,3.4588,1.5023,4.0869,0.0016,6.6074,1.1691,6.511,0.013,2.0088,1.1318,0.0002,6.0994,1.0706,4.1983,0.0012,0.8873,1.6598,0.5958,7.7955,3.5147,3.0352,0.431,4.967,0.7677,4.1657,6.1874,0.0717,5.5529,4.3777,1.0146,7.6303,4.2683,5.9202,4.6102,2.8703,0.1911,0.2523,0.0014,0.648,0.3384,2.0469,2.8548,0.2501,0.1591,3.2579,3.7915,3.4563,5.8145,5.1248,1.4474,0.9228,0.5503,0.0002,4.485,0.3801,1.0245,0.0013,0.6716,0.6759,8.3693,0.0005,4.7547,2.1288,0.2014,1.8789,7.4162,0.2839,0.0907,0.8331,2.3914,0.9584,0.0002,4.1969,0.0008,5.6639,0.7243,6.1338,5.984,0.0563,0.1974,5.4024,1.7765,7.1486,0.7691,2.2996,0.736,1.4319,1.1344,2.3614,4.8464,0.7908,5.0735,6.0895,2.4755,0.7197,4.3381,0.0266,0.0,0.7585,6.5064,0.0008,2.2071,3.0875,3.664,4.6158,1.2633,0.9548,2.1535,0.7362,4.9725,0.0038,2.1438,3.9177,1.0201,0.3124,0.6869,1.5659,4.6666,0.2688,0.0002,0.6027,0.6858,0.0002,3.2974,0.0004,3.5143,2.6771,5.2289,2.5865,0.6852,5.2376,2.0222,1.5965,4.3621,4.3129,3.7883,0.7873,3.4586,1.0658,1.0638,0.0002,4.6768,0.0642,2.0562,1.7563,2.7038,2.5723,2.3729,0.0544,0.8906,3.3191,0.4949,1.7623,5.2299,2.7237,3.5221,2.0726,8.3491,4.9133,1.2502,2.5065,0.0392,4.7362,1.2406,4.5946,2.7827,0.1194,0.0355,3.6985,4.5951,0.1849,0.4983,0.0002,6.9067,0.3578,1.4717,3.7411,2.0659,0.5006,0.0002,0.0001,3.8855,0.6565,1.272,0.9976,10.2185,5.4757,4.0015,2.7174,4.3089,2.7836,1.9086,0.9393,3.8494,1.6827,5.5373,0.0013,2.6211,0.9217,2.5298,0.886,3.4641,0.0163,3.4684,0.4165,7.0504,4.8254,3.8698,4.8698,0.2926,0.9275,1.4485,0.0017,0.0006,1.5355,4.4389,1.6961,3.7386,1.8862,4.1101,1.9939,3.5298,0.0385,1.3744,2.4728,2.7303,0.5197,4.6139,0.0951,0.8678,0.4205,0.3885,0.0001,4.3052,2.7298,6.1572,0.8249,1.0334,1.8463,7.7348,5.8852,1.5944,6.2058,0.8357,5.0014,0.0949,0.0019,0.0,1.2228,1.723,2.1856,6.7282,0.0039,1.8126,4.6387,0.3594,0.0002,1.029,3.3193,0.0047,0.0008,2.2991,5.2656,5.3344,3.7624,0.8735,1.6834,5.1752,9.5053,2.9645,3.8603,6.1603,1.3001,0.016,2.6088,1.5361,7.6867,0.0501,0.8409,1.0979,0.4334,0.0002,3.0895,0.0011,6.8766,0.0124,1.7594,1.1232,1.5337,0.7677,0.0568,0.1538,2.8634,4.035,7.5788,0.2519,0.0027,1.1194,1.2519,3.3131,4.7953,0.0195,0.5617,1.9056,1.0597,2.4909,6.5267,3.341,0.1063,3.6259,2.3693,0.4551,3.0424,4.1705,7.219,7.5733,0.1222,2.1661,3.1854,5.2328,4.0893,3.3775,0.0867,0.723,2.3811,1.3252,4.3068,3.8697,0.0411,5.5661,1.3618,3.6347,3.9783,0.5345]}
{"id":4309,"ended":true,"length":567,"text":"Gauthier's 737 rig \u2014 which required 400 U.S. gallons ( 1 @, @ 500 L ) of hydraulic fluid to construct \u2014 was designed to move across multiple axes in order to better represent the earth on the Moon. The first phase of the maneuver will be to \"align the vehicle with the moon, then we will move two meters off of the moon's surface, then we will turn the rover 90\u00b0, and then drive across,\" said the project's lead engineer, Michael Paquette.\n\nRelated: How astronauts can build the Lunar Rover on the Moon (infographic)\n\nIf and when humans step foot on the lunar surface again, they will need to use rovers similar to Gauthier's to explore the surface of the moon in search of water and other precious resources. With all those trips to the Moon, you can see why the rover's developers at U.S.-based company Heliosphere Technologies Inc have opted to make use of a robotic arm to create the Rover that works in tandem with the company's flagship \"Gauthier\" prototype.\n\nThis concept sketch depicts the \"Gauthier-Rover,\" a rover vehicle that uses an arm controlled by a heliosphere rover to work in tandem with the human-designed rover prototype. Heliosphere Technologies Inc.\n\nHowever, while Gauthier is certainly more expensive (and certainly less capable) than conventional Rovers, it's not actually all that complicated. \"Gauthier and its arm are essentially just hydraulic cylinders,\" Paquette told Space.com. \"Although they are very robust and robust to many uses on the real surface of the moon, they are complex to produce. They need hydraulic fluid.\"\n\nBut that doesn't actually add much to the cost of building the vehicle. \"A lot of it is materials and hardware, so if you can produce those on the moon, it will save a lot on shipping costs,\" said Paquette, who said that the design could even be reproduced on Earth to build a larger version of the rover for use on the International Space Station.\n\nThe company is also hoping to get space agencies and researchers in the United States and elsewhere interested in funding the design, with the company's goal to test the concept by the end of the year. The company would actually like to start working as soon as possible, as Paquette said that he has already developed a rover that could start to be used by NASA by the year 2022, which is an astonishing timeline and one that makes any plans that are currently being discussed by SpaceX's chief Elon Musk look puny.\n\nRelated: Musk's SpaceX makes history with Falcon Heavy launch \u2014 In Photos\n\nNASA's plan to put humans back on the moon is still very much in its infancy, with the program still trying to find out how to actually design and build sustainable lunar rovers, which will also have to work alongside astronauts who will also have the need to do this kind of research. NASA's plan could see the first humans on the Moon in the 2030s.","token_len":625,"entropy":[11.4485,6.3921,2.6778,12.4006,11.8915,5.5483,1.9043,6.8371,7.418,6.8917,0.1028,0.0021,0.0312,1.1396,5.4946,9.4566,10.719,7.1311,6.1002,6.2579,5.2504,2.1281,0.3171,6.434,0.4653,1.2914,7.4157,1.0471,1.57,4.8186,0.7644,5.0598,5.5361,5.8306,6.9261,2.8577,3.2797,0.0194,6.567,6.5756,0.7922,7.7674,5.2097,1.3085,5.4821,0.5068,2.1644,4.5374,3.747,0.6546,0.4637,6.1586,4.8894,1.6194,2.9773,4.7209,7.1588,1.4051,4.9135,1.7386,0.5131,3.1295,3.1257,3.685,6.1095,1.3128,3.041,7.0993,5.6863,4.0471,2.6018,0.416,2.436,2.9346,0.1314,2.5532,1.9731,0.6669,0.1522,4.3212,1.2033,4.0495,5.4896,3.5418,3.2453,1.526,0.968,7.2743,5.4324,6.3365,1.8745,3.9282,3.7954,1.7233,1.7783,1.0799,0.6871,3.9531,7.8484,2.1479,0.0438,0.3743,0.8415,0.0012,5.7122,0.9339,3.4927,6.5254,2.3605,3.543,2.5105,6.3807,3.0076,3.8965,2.4956,0.0413,3.8777,9.884,0.0993,0.1502,0.1397,0.0002,5.9763,6.7086,0.0086,7.1459,4.6733,3.1823,0.1632,0.1297,2.5014,0.0393,5.0292,0.2506,2.5493,0.9215,3.4312,0.5356,3.3214,7.5637,0.003,4.5538,0.1423,14.0489,3.2995,0.0999,0.0679,2.6014,4.4041,1.0421,2.8286,1.5574,0.3931,1.089,3.8009,4.3165,0.0602,3.7821,1.809,1.6732,5.0977,1.1889,0.3373,5.0807,4.9104,2.9689,6.6749,2.2231,0.6101,1.415,1.1335,5.2938,1.7805,2.941,3.0976,1.9001,3.0197,2.6422,7.4574,5.5204,5.3763,1.1557,0.054,2.2172,0.0903,3.4707,7.0472,1.3125,6.4844,5.1618,4.4843,5.2723,5.2465,0.5476,3.6176,3.4162,0.0071,1.8334,3.8332,1.8427,1.657,4.7552,1.2791,6.4162,3.9823,5.6365,2.7598,1.0103,0.0876,0.6915,5.9513,0.0398,6.2848,5.9489,4.3119,4.199,0.0006,1.2298,6.6621,0.5106,0.4822,0.0002,4.6397,5.6948,9.6969,4.5963,0.796,4.242,0.6857,0.0007,0.0019,4.4926,4.6991,2.1203,3.3156,1.2131,3.2791,6.2285,1.1294,2.7276,2.9819,3.5242,6.337,0.1587,0.9471,6.1371,0.2525,1.5891,6.1604,1.5728,5.1781,1.3002,0.3146,0.0661,0.8212,5.925,1.6548,3.7029,1.2747,7.2052,0.6183,2.461,0.0044,0.0918,2.0154,2.324,0.3678,0.5994,0.0002,6.2717,0.0368,3.0357,3.7157,0.0019,0.0018,2.6731,5.8764,3.903,5.0621,5.0676,3.286,4.4814,3.2257,2.9931,0.7567,0.2153,7.2653,8.0457,0.0203,0.508,1.6368,1.055,1.9745,5.8696,4.2898,0.2609,3.7922,0.5344,2.9758,3.8582,0.0002,0.0062,4.2016,2.3168,5.5733,1.4556,4.0979,3.6521,8.9996,5.9525,1.9334,0.6624,0.0013,0.0021,2.4499,0.7387,0.1775,0.0023,0.3649,0.3757,7.4047,2.1524,1.3343,2.9748,5.5053,1.969,4.6512,3.9893,5.5485,4.0404,5.2839,0.4316,7.9367,4.8707,0.6186,0.1024,1.3479,0.176,0.9843,0.9985,6.9125,1.8133,4.2585,1.9675,2.3523,2.4655,7.2005,1.5698,4.1889,0.2439,0.0001,4.6629,2.6544,1.8607,0.0004,6.8714,6.1655,2.1341,0.484,0.2339,1.4219,0.4681,3.146,1.2691,3.7502,0.8535,1.18,4.4518,1.5462,0.0865,3.8797,0.7516,8.5433,1.9407,4.7292,1.8299,2.7568,3.1375,0.8356,2.8584,3.5055,4.0938,4.5898,0.7,2.0123,0.6001,1.9037,2.5287,4.1863,1.9708,0.1252,5.586,5.3087,2.2193,0.5805,2.4188,0.2481,0.0014,0.0025,2.4498,0.7524,3.0466,1.7983,1.6744,4.8185,4.1661,3.4995,1.0953,8.7234,1.1796,2.7185,3.7887,4.0345,1.2496,3.5591,2.8215,0.5345,0.18,1.0358,4.6951,1.2899,0.6309,1.209,2.7584,0.0007,0.0001,0.2899,0.3935,0.0002,2.3362,3.7838,1.9362,0.9537,4.2087,0.3931,3.2703,8.3302,3.0604,2.9165,4.6363,3.8857,0.6348,2.8656,0.0397,1.7819,2.8844,1.6126,0.1248,6.3284,0.8116,3.5711,2.2278,4.5417,1.3694,4.606,1.8997,3.577,1.7745,5.7415,0.9862,2.6954,3.0698,1.7041,0.1221,0.0009,1.3291,0.2797,0.3102,2.6661,1.7238,5.4881,7.9028,1.873,0.2057,4.1926,2.8588,7.2976,2.032,0.0024,0.5966,1.9296,3.4003,4.3527,0.0021,0.0022,1.0359,1.4471,3.0793,3.1681,1.7261,5.5997,1.0199,4.782,1.1993,1.7371,5.1368,2.8182,3.3696,0.8148,2.5345,1.4634,4.1055,0.9852,4.0896,3.72,2.1974,2.7205,1.3632,4.8023,6.1894,3.5222,5.4496,3.3309,0.3422,4.5716,5.2168,5.7477,4.3609,2.9386,4.9431,2.3028,2.1069,2.9905,7.0644,3.2977,5.9557,3.6331,0.0013,1.3353,11.9797,0.117,0.2043,0.2919,0.0002,1.1477,0.0123,5.7405,2.0378,2.0524,7.5009,3.5655,1.5843,2.4855,1.1992,3.5304,4.2682,9.2527,3.6694,0.2592,0.0002,4.8406,1.505,4.8732,1.206,4.7168,3.6175,5.2209,0.2277,0.3274,1.4855,1.3662,3.0266,3.7875,0.0595,0.6485,1.5916,2.2941,0.5407,2.8989,1.4845,4.9458,1.9623,6.6337,0.054,2.742,3.0909,1.6796,2.0118,4.1308,6.9839,1.6541,1.1054,9.0463,2.882,3.674,0.0004,2.0646,2.9662,2.9512,4.5121,3.2853,0.3806,4.404,4.7128,5.1328,4.2872,2.1717,3.1101,2.7367,3.7003,5.7841,0.2362,4.4437,4.3509,3.0399,0.0006,1.9592,0.5704,3.6688,1.5416,3.1295,4.7952,4.0046,1.9017,2.9319,2.6443,1.3206,0.1507,1.0296,2.2618,1.9667,0.5336,0.032,1.8869]}
{"id":2522,"ended":true,"length":584,"text":"Dogs and gray wolves do not voluntarily interbreed in the wild, though they can produce fertile wolf @ - @ dog offspring. In North America, black colored wolves acquired their coloration from interbreeding with brown colored dogs. The process occurs through a process called gene flow. The result, a black wolf, is thought to have two dog @ genes in its cell, the same way that a \"feral\" dog (a dog that did not go through the domestication process ) has two human @ genes in its DNA. Genes, in DNA, make up our DNA, and are held in our cells.\n\nBlack color is not due to a mutation in DNA. Rather, it's an extreme version of pigmentation that the brown wolf had as a dog because. In North America, black colored wolves never mixed with the color of dogs in the wild. Instead, a \"domesticated\" wolf got the genes to acquire black coloring through interbreeding with domesticated dogs in the wild ( and possibly with domestic wolves or small dogs ). Once interbreeding started, color mixing occurred all the time. Genes that originally came with the wolf @ crossed with genes that had first come with the domestic dogs and this became a mutation.\n\nThe gene pool of wild dogs is not uniform; rather, it is a mixture of both dog and wolf DNA. However, the interbreeding that has occurred has created a genetically uniform population of black colored domesticated dogs. Wild wolves are not present and therefore do not produce black colored dogs.\n\nIn this example, genetic variation of the domesticated dogs' DNA, either from the purebred lines that started the process, or a combination of the two, were modified by interbreeding with the black wolf. The gene pool of the black wolf is also influenced by the breed of dog it interbreeds with, so if the dog has white, yellow, or any other color as well as black, then the black wolf may also have the white, yellow or of other colors as well.\n\nThis example also shows how gene flow occurs. During the course of the interbreeding, the genes for black coloring are modified. They can become \"recessive \" as they were in the wild black wolf, or they can become \"dominant \" as they are in the domestic dog. It's like taking the black dog genes and either making them dominant or recessive. The result is a color that was not original to the dog. Black colored black wolves also have a gene or genes that were originally present in the black breed of dog in a smaller percentage. The black coloring may or may not be present in the wolf.\n\nThe genetic variation between black wolves and the other wolves is also influenced by the domestic dogs that the white wolf interbreeds with. The dog may or may not carry \"black\" genes.

{"id":897,"ended":true,"length":512,"text":"The term Wicca appears to have developed within the Pagan Witchcraft community during the early 1960s, as increasing numbers of Pagan Witches learned of the Old English term wicca, the etymological origin of which is not recorded. As it turned out, Wiccans discovered that they needed to change the name of the community, and they changed it from \"Christian witchcraft\" to witchcraft.\n\nA variety of sources now attest to the fact that those early folk called themselves Wiccan. The New Order Book 1 says \"Wicca\" was the spelling originally used [by folk who were part of the Church Society and called themselves \"Wiccas\"]. In 1965, Gerald Gardner wrote Witches' Sabbath Book 1. One of the paragraphs begins, \"Today there are thousands of folk called 'Wicca'.\" [Gardner may have intended the word folk as \"Wiccans\", or perhaps the English plural \"Folks\", which in this context also refers to Wiccans.)\n\nThe term \"Wicca\" has been a part of the community all along. The problem has been that there have been different spellings of the name. Some spellings are acceptable for publication, others are not and must be substituted. In keeping with the intent of this website, we recommend the spelling Witches' Sabbath.\n\nAnother etymological source is the word wicca, which is an Old English word that means \"vowel\". Wicca is the name of a deity worshipped by early Pagans known as Wotan, the ancient Germanic pagan God. The term wiccan is etymologically derived both from the ancient European deity and the word wicca. [The etymological link between the word Wodan and the term wicca may go back to the ancient Indo-European religion known as Proto-Indo-European, the original language from which European languages came. In ancient times, wicca, Wodan and wicca all had the same common origin.]\n\nWicca is NOT the etymological origin of the Pagan religious society called Wiccans. The etymologically correct term for Pagans who call themselves Wiccans is Witches' Sabbath. The term Wiccans was derived from the Wiccan religion, which is NOT the etymologically correct term for Pagans. This distinction is crucial to ensure that we are not confused with folk, religious worshippers and not worshipers of a deity or deity spirits.\n\nWiccan, a compound in a compound, can be seen as \"the religion derived from Woden, the goddess worshipped in ancient Europe and known variously as the Germanic goddess and Wodan.\"\n\nWe invite individuals to study the Old English words wicca and wicca, as they relate to the etymological sources used today as an indicator of the modern Wicca religion. The history of the ancient religion of Woden's religion provides information of historical significance concerning our religious practices.","token_len":626,"entropy":[7.9794,9.2431,4.9291,0.9198,6.1798,1.3254,1.4341,5.9501,5.8296,0.7895,5.5566,9.2694,0.3469,1.3964,3.7013,0.218,2.2733,4.7812,0.3393,1.5344,2.6867,9.5457,0.7992,0.0716,3.3274,3.6074,5.7956,3.7516,0.9033,6.9872,4.6904,2.2854,3.2885,0.385,0.0517,1.5643,3.407,7.7271,1.7998,0.0027,0.2548,4.9717,0.1126,0.4462,1.5303,2.4303,6.7838,1.1479,4.0562,4.3631,3.0229,0.0038,0.1628,2.6635,2.66,0.0166,6.4255,1.4122,3.6767,5.3572,0.7647,5.5435,1.1062,1.7293,0.8381,1.065,7.3993,2.3642,1.6547,3.1123,3.9946,0.8593,2.4846,2.2648,6.427,5.7188,0.2172,0.1472,6.399,1.7509,1.8247,0.0062,4.1336,5.9085,0.004,5.7726,5.7378,6.2214,0.3723,0.6494,3.0885,0.0193,6.8272,4.2781,6.6674,6.3697,3.9296,1.0641,0.4595,1.7951,3.8604,2.1722,4.7792,8.0355,7.2452,7.4512,4.9354,3.573,1.1799,0.3268,0.659,1.6489,1.5186,2.3261,7.1602,6.2358,0.723,9.1762,3.926,8.658,2.4574,2.0474,5.4665,0.1192,0.2734,5.2557,8.6565,3.5413,5.048,0.4413,2.2269,0.7699,0.7127,4.4807,1.632,1.7683,3.0665,7.9037,0.5158,7.9278,6.0736,3.3829,10.7224,3.0391,7.3454,4.4862,1.5927,3.323,6.1275,0.6399,0.512,11.8148,4.7202,1.3524,0.2027,5.8807,3.3087,0.5447,4.1474,0.213,5.8191,1.8802,2.8622,0.2415,0.2418,1.375,4.0001,3.381,5.3512,0.0453,0.0023,7.8911,0.3924,4.2723,1.6753,2.0201,9.0251,2.7669,3.3144,2.1589,2.9359,0.63,1.9634,3.0549,3.8304,3.1942,4.3672,6.9837,1.9517,6.3592,6.0055,1.3081,1.4639,2.5208,3.6782,3.2189,1.3515,5.8449,2.3886,0.0172,2.3287,0.344,0.0123,5.9731,1.3359,0.0002,1.8939,3.2518,1.5045,0.5677,0.2396,0.4762,0.1335,2.1975,1.2749,4.0057,3.2362,0.0167,1.0958,4.9797,6.2697,1.0898,0.9661,2.2219,8.2193,3.6558,0.5128,0.948,3.2812,2.1316,0.1272,5.9301,6.0088,0.0015,2.0558,0.6171,3.7291,1.6892,2.6732,4.7661,2.661,1.9657,7.5088,2.642,11.1535,1.3743,1.3232,0.8873,0.7225,3.7595,5.8974,0.3372,7.1488,1.2233,2.6326,7.918,0.0057,0.8859,6.6009,0.1279,1.6552,4.3064,0.1707,1.5507,4.9004,2.7411,4.4712,11.7105,0.2127,0.1206,2.6235,1.0264,0.0002,5.443,8.6826,0.8948,0.0222,0.0252,1.2669,2.632,1.0005,5.1243,3.2624,0.5269,0.1841,1.7746,0.8259,1.3175,3.7385,2.9001,0.2701,0.6939,2.5099,2.0511,0.3294,6.8741,3.4055,1.6525,2.1702,2.7372,0.0699,0.0511,1.146,2.2509,2.2408,0.5269,0.7455,3.4337,4.6428,0.7651,4.3995,4.5054,0.0019,6.4528,0.1795,1.6717,5.9348,0.6853,1.4291,2.2406,4.4685,4.3974,0.0516,4.2782,4.7894,1.3427,1.8194,2.9548,1.8179,0.1056,3.8106,1.4255,8.7382,0.027,0.0437,0.6729,3.562,7.9877,0.0708,1.0029,3.8289,6.8039,4.6945,2.5303,1.7016,3.6811,1.5199,0.2354,0.3311,1.4689,4.6283,2.8723,4.384,0.2994,0.0312,0.1019,5.6262,2.8592,0.9776,2.7026,3.697,8.6359,0.1723,0.4,2.9565,0.8806,0.1476,0.3531,3.9906,6.5277,1.2302,0.63,0.832,3.8623,4.7089,0.0126,0.037,4.6199,2.7081,0.0207,5.2878,0.0277,0.4568,0.0027,0.003,0.0066,1.5683,3.0798,4.7541,2.3741,5.0549,0.0934,6.9125,0.991,2.9918,1.0911,2.7358,4.0093,1.3574,0.3983,2.4628,0.26,0.3928,4.0086,5.3479,0.9149,1.3895,1.9156,0.5691,0.3246,6.741,3.0972,0.8814,0.1174,4.9314,2.8809,1.9667,0.5871,0.0002,1.9111,0.2092,0.3893,1.3762,7.2279,1.5228,7.6143,0.1002,0.0097,0.0402,2.6111,0.1319,0.6107,5.4112,8.2045,8.6353,5.7864,0.8472,2.3918,0.0233,0.4537,1.874,4.4885,0.0199,0.0051,4.9017,3.2847,2.5379,2.6724,7.7602,0.0101,3.2901,3.4704,0.0107,0.8079,0.9864,0.0181,0.6479,5.533,0.0255,0.0948,0.5083,2.0791,2.0326,1.677,2.5424,0.0944,2.1603,4.1336,0.133,0.5906,4.084,0.3516,0.97,3.9661,1.6229,1.3948,1.4447,7.0558,0.6729,2.0322,0.0006,0.0022,1.3041,0.0139,0.9001,0.0762,1.5662,0.0002,2.3496,3.8845,5.5936,0.9145,4.1199,1.3284,6.1061,0.4285,3.1098,1.7639,1.2044,3.6272,0.5681,6.9473,4.6302,6.293,9.5858,0.0061,3.2314,3.4561,6.5059,0.5088,0.3472,3.1668,2.8078,3.5594,2.4816,9.8128,0.5496,0.6345,0.0002,1.7774,0.3856,1.0329,3.6541,3.8933,7.4736,5.5718,5.25,3.6555,1.5994,3.5049,1.0253,5.2872,0.3804,4.6444,2.4878,5.489,7.2473,0.1054,2.089,8.2177,2.8988,1.7962,1.0864,4.4274,5.3935,1.8196,2.8591,3.389,2.298,4.7018,9.5323,0.0643,0.3238,1.4972,5.0419,0.0493,1.5613,3.5567,2.3708,1.4464,1.8204,2.7618,0.0002,4.6207,6.817,7.985,1.1535,4.7263,0.8451,4.63,0.2311,3.4612,2.3492,0.5955,0.4144,0.7755,0.6208,0.9221,1.0944,2.6279,2.0698,1.8742,4.6241,0.0757,1.0201,5.6855,0.0453,0.0419,0.0601,5.2082,3.2378,4.9548,5.188,4.6935,4.0141,0.1947,1.1183,5.5365,4.3776,0.3294,1.2377,4.0636,0.244,2.7347,6.1142,0.1958,1.2064,4.4515,4.7743,2.7392,0.7391,2.8691,0.0195,5.8002,5.1734,5.3882,4.1239,5.3076,4.9674,1.9648,5.7986,4.8661,5.4465,2.2959,1.0298]}

{"id":2015,"ended":true,"length":547,"text":"On September 6, a tropical depression formed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea within a trough of low pressure extended southeastward from Delia, which was situated over southeast Texas at the time. The depression proceeded gradually northwestward, and turned south late on September 7, just south of the island of Espa\u00f1ola, Texas. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Lili, and quickly accelerated west through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel on September 8. On the 9th, Lili moved onshore near Ciudad Campeche, entering the Atlantic Ocean and briefly becoming a category 1 hurricane with 70 mph winds and a minimum pressure of 1013 mb (Hanna only had a minimum pressure of 1005 mb when it formed). A reconnaissance aircraft had reported strong winds and 10 foot seas in the eye, as well as heavy rains and some damage in parts of Campeche \u2014 conditions that favored landfalling the hurricane. However, the storm turned east-northeast and dissipated on the 10th.\n\nDespite the small size of the area affected, it was regarded as a damaging hurricane because of the winds that reached hurricane status in Mexico. As the storm approached land, heavy rains reached Mexico City and killed at least ten people and destroyed 300,000 acres (100,000 hectares) of sugar fields. Six people were killed in Mexico in related flooding.\n\nLili was the first hurricane of the season to impact Mexico, although the season itself had been one of active cyclones. Tropical Storm Hanna formed on July 21 and moved west into the Gulf of Mexico. Heavy rains fell along the Gulf coast, killing 20 people and causing $45 million (2005 dollars) damage. Hanna became the first tropical storm to ever hit southern Texas and the second hurricane to impact the Panhandle.\n\nThe hurricane season of 2005 also saw several tropical cyclones form in the Caribbean Sea. Tropical Storm Irene formed on August 25 and moved west-northwest. After moving into the Gulf of Mexico, Irene intensified slightly, becoming the first hurricane of the season to impact Cuba. Irene did not cause any damage to Cuba nor Florida, although it inflicted heavy damage on Haiti in the form of floods, mudslides, and landslides.\n\nThe largest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Wilma, which was an extremely fast and intense hurricane which came closest to making landfall anywhere on earth. Wilma formed on October 28 at the Sismonde Peninsula of Puerto Rico and moved north-northeast. On November 2 after passing near Hispaniola, Wilma turned northeast and quickly intensified further, becoming a Category 5 storm with winds of 165 mph (265 km\/h) and a minimum pressure of 850 mb (26.94 inHg). The storm then made landfall close to the mouth of the Mississippi River three days later as a Category 3 hurricane. Wilma was an exceptionally devastating hurricane with winds up to 250 mph (400 km\/h) and gusts reaching 295 mph (480 km\/h), and it was estimated to be responsible for 7,000 deaths in Mexico.","token_len":626,"entropy":[7.5319,3.4282,0.3447,4.2139,9.9514,5.3064,4.5451,3.0161,1.0437,5.9724,4.2355,3.4714,7.6598,1.8974,11.8524,1.4275,5.3239,0.4612,9.5234,6.8986,0.5792,2.2452,9.437,6.5605,1.4577,4.2979,2.1793,5.2506,4.4699,6.35,4.1152,4.4397,1.6004,1.4976,1.9047,1.2711,1.52,7.5914,6.4694,3.9929,0.3313,2.1059,2.4858,6.6804,1.931,8.4238,2.0073,0.4639,1.2227,1.2662,4.4621,2.8349,0.0148,1.5356,4.286,0.1247,7.5517,2.5344,0.921,1.5902,1.3215,6.6788,0.3479,1.4158,1.8829,6.1597,3.7793,7.5922,1.516,4.8187,8.5748,1.8022,2.4627,5.3913,6.0783,2.65,5.7204,0.6239,6.8342,0.2313,2.3257,0.0002,6.7655,4.1959,0.2319,0.9765,0.7897,3.1831,3.3716,3.7148,0.0191,0.4488,3.221,0.0547,3.1093,5.481,6.0215,5.1364,6.9892,0.0263,0.0024,7.375,0.548,0.1367,0.6308,8.1669,0.7018,4.2648,0.3314,2.4545,6.4303,4.0439,0.8649,5.9707,2.163,0.1897,3.8867,7.9559,0.3449,0.145,1.8568,1.8333,4.401,3.7395,0.1394,5.806,4.4972,2.2683,1.8323,1.4341,8.7762,10.7398,8.8889,3.4096,0.7426,2.089,0.6802,0.0768,4.3896,4.1073,0.0472,0.0014,5.1455,1.1679,2.61,1.4039,3.9352,11.0429,3.4961,4.2806,4.5915,5.8882,0.674,2.3571,7.7258,6.3967,3.1593,2.4771,0.541,9.5682,3.7302,3.8207,0.504,0.0055,3.9016,2.7756,1.5453,5.2749,5.3125,3.0383,4.2995,0.011,5.8118,0.0386,0.0135,9.4268,6.3824,0.8188,7.6977,4.7386,1.0655,3.655,2.8298,1.3523,4.7122,0.0208,1.3292,1.9922,5.1884,2.831,4.0761,2.0626,0.0951,0.0124,1.973,6.6859,0.0025,2.7832,1.4651,0.3867,0.0058,1.1959,1.7877,0.0042,5.8064,1.1681,5.8652,1.3123,0.2482,0.6294,6.0174,3.3952,1.2111,2.7925,0.935,7.8164,0.2202,1.0375,9.0462,1.978,4.2207,0.4728,1.1036,6.2913,2.1274,5.2463,4.7453,5.6613,2.0964,4.1401,1.6131,3.9434,2.0793,1.3629,2.2973,6.237,0.6443,5.6201,1.2304,5.4184,3.5693,1.3816,1.5276,5.4954,1.7262,0.0005,5.6664,0.2839,1.9063,2.192,6.5259,3.0732,0.0128,3.9755,2.5454,4.7601,0.466,0.0254,0.7893,0.6125,0.1724,7.7803,5.4063,1.0543,7.845,2.4555,0.5486,0.3395,1.1702,3.8322,3.8164,7.6251,2.8156,1.2573,1.514,0.0003,3.9362,1.3678,2.09,2.701,1.6373,1.0955,3.2687,0.5867,2.5115,0.3397,4.5566,2.4953,2.0372,4.9385,2.1282,5.6737,4.3686,3.042,1.4802,5.1416,0.0684,6.6706,4.1234,1.0509,1.1154,5.6659,0.333,8.4188,4.6436,1.633,4.0979,3.3829,2.3157,3.414,2.4486,3.7594,0.5388,2.1869,0.0806,0.0606,1.6514,5.934,0.7693,5.0311,3.9473,0.3689,2.5243,2.1004,1.2774,3.2101,5.3884,0.8599,0.6864,2.8121,3.9815,5.213,0.1929,1.8101,9.0063,2.2547,0.117,1.7532,0.7776,3.5369,4.227,0.9556,1.5382,2.5675,0.6611,0.5889,4.9205,1.8263,4.6351,2.549,2.0025,2.0912,1.6495,1.8812,0.5734,3.4691,1.024,6.658,0.072,0.8113,1.0638,0.0002,1.9412,2.6836,2.3031,3.9988,2.6532,4.6851,1.0241,3.1562,3.8339,0.3873,0.0482,3.8998,1.3398,0.994,2.5392,2.6122,0.9019,3.346,0.3775,4.6578,0.0023,2.0906,0.7082,2.0727,3.7062,1.0996,1.013,1.721,4.7728,1.0984,0.0749,4.3511,4.8114,3.743,2.9057,0.325,1.2178,0.2172,0.0631,0.3633,2.1177,0.0002,5.5817,5.8198,1.6268,3.1207,1.7416,0.9794,0.8991,2.1171,0.299,0.2833,0.1576,2.5324,5.1663,0.9236,2.5368,0.0002,5.2954,0.2992,3.5934,2.1427,1.8906,1.328,3.165,5.2631,8.1182,0.8237,2.5964,1.3576,7.08,3.0358,0.4259,0.9885,4.7894,3.9655,1.9447,4.4584,0.0006,4.5381,1.5568,2.2984,0.0245,0.0028,0.5038,0.6936,1.7018,0.0029,0.2478,1.0371,0.0002,1.7453,5.2438,2.4563,0.543,0.0719,1.3006,0.799,0.3332,1.366,1.4898,5.0971,0.0526,1.2426,0.4623,2.7379,5.2383,3.9264,5.64,2.6312,3.3651,1.3321,4.3494,5.4471,6.4532,0.0572,5.2149,0.0055,9.307,1.4119,2.9038,1.3913,2.7176,0.003,4.0134,1.2275,2.3795,3.925,3.7811,2.169,5.9089,9.9777,4.889,4.8525,2.5951,3.0469,0.0477,1.4797,2.1295,2.0231,1.7128,2.0313,0.0043,0.0005,2.8237,3.9487,1.4348,2.4365,8.5549,3.0582,3.8718,4.2185,0.0011,0.2693,0.7068,0.0039,4.8715,2.5417,1.2342,5.0775,4.9344,5.115,2.028,2.0329,1.7306,0.287,1.741,2.1038,1.3486,2.8253,0.1608,4.7762,0.4736,0.4222,5.9594,0.9409,0.1081,0.009,0.7806,0.331,0.9482,0.8951,0.1386,0.012,5.4758,0.033,0.0058,0.0261,6.2457,2.1969,6.6067,4.0281,5.0255,4.2785,0.3743,1.7461,1.4169,3.19,3.8017,0.0674,7.5979,0.0209,1.3749,5.2688,0.0085,0.3956,3.5425,0.4022,9.2013,0.3513,0.0918,5.1087,1.2845,0.1229,2.0171,0.7637,0.7639,2.0844,0.0061,1.9176,4.5908,2.9663,5.1814,0.8345,2.6746,1.9314,4.4219,0.0064,4.257,0.1011,0.0609,3.3706,0.0221,0.008,0.0018,0.6492,0.383,4.31,0.0308,5.2366,6.2833,1.0259,0.0071,3.9108,0.0081,0.0015,0.0017,2.0492,1.7065,3.5563,1.5508,5.0276,1.2744,2.703,3.1915,0.0038,5.4484,1.3308,0.8723,0.3584,2.3358,4.2388,0.9196]}
{"id":4537,"ended":true,"length":600,"text":"Du Bois traveled to Europe in 1921 to attend the second Pan @ - @ African Congress. The assembled black leaders from around the world issued the London Resolutions and established a Pan @ - @ African Federation. As one of the four founders of the Pan @ - @ African Forum, Du Bois was a central player in the formulation of Pan - @ African thought. He is well known for his theory of color being the basis of human hierarchy; he theorized that people of color were inferior because their color was different from that of people of European descent. He believed that the white man held a superior and eternal position in relation to non - @ whites because he was white. Du Bois's theory of color had strong influence on the formation of The Ku Klux Klan because his theory of color as a hierarchy allowed those he categorized as 'races different from white people' to be held responsible for all their ancestors' wrongdoings.\n\nHe also worked closely with The Black Panther Party, the U.S.'s fastest growing social movement that was focused on African American liberation. They believed that black people had to fight against white supremacy in all forms because black people lived in fear of their lives, did not work for sufficient wages, and suffered from the effects of discrimination and racism.\n\nDu Bois believed that the African American community needed to work in concert with others of color in their struggle for equality. If the black community did not work together to achieve unity in its struggle for economic, political, and social equality, their struggle would not be successful. During his time at the Pan African Congress, Du Bois had strong disagreements with both Marcus Garvey and Elijah Muhammad over the role that Muslims were playing in the African American struggle for civil rights. Du Bois believed that Muslims should not be involved in the civil rights movement and said that this made many African Americans angry at him because they felt that he was excluding them from their struggle. Du Bois and the other 'Big Four' founders of the Pan African Congress also believed that all black people, regardless of their culture, religion, and tradition, should unite in the struggle for African American independence. This meant that in the same way that the Jews and the European Americans fought together against the Nazis during World War II, Africans and African Americans should unite against the European Americans who were treating them unfairly.\n\nIn his book, 'The Souls of Black Folk', Du Bois outlined the concept that blacks, because of their shared black color, cannot afford to be separate and independent of one another. He believed that blacks in a racially divided society will always be under the control of those who keep the race oppressed. He also believed that people of all races who are fighting racial injustice and oppression should work together; the white man is no different from his black accusers, and it is time for them to realize that. Du Bois believed that the only way black people would finally achieve their goal of gaining economic and political independence would be through unity and a shared commitment to justice, and his belief that they did not have an obligation to those in power.","token_len":626,"entropy":[8.8375,2.209,12.0997,0.6875,5.0046,2.1843,6.5966,1.2708,3.6988,0.7973,5.4881,7.7716,14.9649,7.762,8.001,8.968,4.9958,2.0255,3.2411,10.0507,6.5473,1.8833,4.1203,3.1581,0.0782,0.4913,6.695,2.7856,9.02,8.0477,0.3348,2.932,5.1857,1.7985,4.9945,2.1925,0.7596,0.1329,0.8713,6.2407,1.8758,4.5038,4.3628,0.3299,0.3694,6.1301,4.1237,0.2779,0.5051,0.9471,0.2277,0.0792,0.0112,0.2352,7.0538,0.4844,5.7556,0.0207,0.001,1.5768,1.962,5.2921,5.2227,0.2255,1.0783,6.5082,0.2788,3.3622,6.571,0.013,0.4602,8.1898,0.9983,1.7134,3.5479,3.7846,0.3156,0.5847,0.4231,6.8766,0.6469,7.0477,7.894,1.8641,2.3784,0.6587,5.4586,8.3415,4.583,2.2137,5.6122,0.6127,0.346,4.2618,2.0783,0.7185,1.2415,5.2224,3.059,2.8424,3.0579,0.8438,4.1409,0.4651,2.5105,0.0616,5.7047,0.1873,4.8436,0.4255,0.4177,2.224,3.2794,0.2635,1.8309,3.4413,2.1569,6.1115,2.4567,2.1299,4.9328,7.4929,1.8804,1.0943,5.9077,0.0213,5.994,7.7138,10.1526,4.3009,3.6192,0.823,0.9207,3.4786,0.7413,0.9912,0.017,0.001,3.2731,1.9716,0.8817,0.8318,4.5492,5.6209,3.0857,0.5636,0.9808,3.6011,0.1164,6.9182,6.7319,0.0033,0.0034,5.7622,3.5346,0.8987,0.8026,0.3852,5.8643,1.2095,7.0291,7.3729,5.3174,5.6217,7.5258,0.3144,3.0427,7.1743,0.2831,12.1536,0.539,2.4257,1.537,0.436,0.2119,2.1657,4.8042,3.3496,0.1244,4.7039,3.6954,8.5431,0.9898,5.2016,1.6082,0.0008,0.322,2.327,0.0809,4.5706,2.3979,4.4893,2.2999,0.0182,5.4619,3.6927,0.8965,0.024,1.8584,2.4709,5.3943,0.2422,0.083,3.3238,0.2412,6.8012,0.0341,4.6928,0.3007,3.4979,2.2606,6.1827,0.1558,3.2852,1.4999,3.025,1.0096,5.2873,4.7854,0.4391,2.1108,1.4202,2.3031,2.8072,2.8171,2.1945,1.5725,0.5847,2.6966,5.1278,2.4484,3.9185,2.1863,0.5089,4.9926,0.5533,3.6337,0.3891,2.5176,4.1367,2.9759,7.1054,0.0446,4.6498,2.6773,12.1344,1.4006,0.6153,1.2836,4.2402,0.8036,3.2102,3.054,0.0161,3.7409,2.3579,2.5121,0.4126,1.6423,0.0002,1.0843,0.0108,0.0009,4.6413,0.2389,1.9729,3.3562,0.8782,1.4,2.4418,0.4436,3.5068,3.2682,4.5398,0.9362,3.5591,3.3932,1.0673,2.7479,4.0854,0.8212,0.9645,1.6343,0.7594,5.882,2.3082,2.4385,0.3286,2.1353,0.0168,1.8164,0.4828,1.9334,2.4338,5.2194,3.2277,3.1934,0.2453,0.8555,4.2125,3.3546,1.3908,0.4634,0.3967,0.3336,1.1077,0.2111,4.9302,1.3112,0.8437,2.2077,0.9121,1.2296,0.3489,7.1134,1.5155,1.1954,1.5591,0.8567,0.8126,6.9667,0.8103,0.3202,0.0569,0.0018,0.0018,4.1212,4.5387,4.9023,0.0982,3.8316,9.7875,0.9041,0.0068,0.3292,6.349,0.5854,2.5877,1.2979,2.7361,3.3787,7.2831,3.1637,0.5017,0.0989,1.0543,2.5552,0.2994,1.8544,1.7224,3.2824,0.0376,0.2765,1.1134,0.0017,0.0025,2.541,0.1447,2.3591,2.5608,1.394,0.6946,3.107,0.1479,0.9525,2.6203,0.018,1.2916,2.4688,4.6816,0.322,4.3905,5.3032,6.0509,1.5481,0.2929,4.8869,3.2851,3.3851,3.1118,1.3652,1.8337,0.9072,1.8753,0.8189,7.3119,0.4877,0.5063,2.0651,2.6007,0.6978,1.2916,0.0011,0.0026,5.0845,2.9625,2.7619,6.0717,7.1826,2.636,0.0575,6.3376,0.6503,0.2278,0.3987,1.5272,0.3508,3.0406,2.137,0.182,4.2914,2.7057,0.6937,4.3899,1.0366,0.0023,1.0448,6.1773,0.5245,2.9806,0.0936,2.6196,7.7274,0.1491,0.9376,4.5902,1.2138,1.7695,0.4954,0.3202,4.6052,1.0619,4.5838,0.4,4.0036,3.4962,0.3177,4.8751,2.1021,5.1674,0.4507,0.2844,2.1604,6.4745,1.4089,1.5115,7.1078,5.3569,3.0025,4.8279,2.6522,1.0288,1.7153,3.446,0.3482,0.0022,0.2187,0.2585,5.827,1.7883,1.9738,0.1443,1.6107,1.2999,3.1268,0.8014,3.1756,1.5556,2.5221,1.4929,6.7744,0.4277,2.3672,0.5588,0.8278,0.0002,2.3062,2.0702,2.5938,1.093,3.5563,1.4767,8.9728,0.2226,2.8538,3.0194,1.6136,0.3365,0.0025,0.0021,4.7621,1.3247,4.6065,2.4993,3.6787,3.2615,5.1567,0.3656,0.1485,5.477,4.9875,7.376,0.4227,5.6697,5.974,0.4388,1.3744,6.1358,3.1402,4.3351,2.2371,2.2575,0.0039,0.3299,1.3688,2.2904,0.077,2.4162,4.1969,3.9979,4.6586,2.0021,0.4889,4.7769,2.9585,1.5167,4.6132,1.3321,1.7264,0.0268,4.2998,0.7494,6.4203,2.3384,5.5817,6.7877,0.9899,1.9804,1.8625,0.9547,0.0601,4.8392,0.6556,3.9782,0.342,3.5699,2.0272,5.423,5.8087,1.6093,2.863,1.6538,1.8465,2.6045,0.218,7.3834,3.5856,3.6517,1.7472,3.2642,4.9882,1.086,1.2847,4.4796,0.8739,10.133,0.0127,2.3984,1.2877,4.4434,0.6989,3.3205,0.9139,2.7695,0.0375,4.2684,0.6299,4.5983,1.6673,0.0016,0.0038,1.5194,0.0676,1.9729,3.5061,0.3353,3.3691,0.2922,2.3918,6.3426,3.4002,2.0926,2.9751,0.4671,4.8119,3.0968,1.7649,0.2809,2.1911,2.6474,0.0575,1.6253,4.274,1.3754,4.0341,3.3881,3.9354,0.0552,4.5743,2.7874,3.119,4.2697,1.7976,0.7314,4.1572,4.3389,0.5989,1.044,5.7461,3.1471,0.0386,7.0007,2.9479,0.4587,2.5851]}
{"id":4019,"ended":true,"length":590,"text":"A dusty plasma contains tiny charged particles of dust ( typically found in space ). The dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each other. A plasma that contains larger particles is considered super heated and the temperature of the plasma is very high. The hotter the plasma the smaller the amount of radiation it will emit while a cooler plasma emits greater amounts of radiation ( the same is true for the cooler the plasma the hotter the radiation ).\n\nThis is why space is often observed with radio radiation, it is due to the presence, in space, of radiation hot plasmas.\n\nIf plasma is heated and becomes super heated it can burn, and then we have super hot plasmas. To explain this idea let us use the example of a very small piece of wood, as wood is a great conductor it can be heated to very high temperatures and turn into a plasma.\n\nWhat happens when the small piece of wood becomes a plasma?\n\nWe know that the smaller the particles that make up the plasma the cooler the radiation it will emit. Let us consider a woody piece of paper, that has been heated to a very high temperature, it will then only emit radiation, that is to say super hot radiation.\n\nSo how big have to be the particles that make up this material in order to generate a plasma in space?\n\nIn space the electrons are free to move around and it is possible for the particles to come in close proximity to each other and merge together. In fact small particles can coalesce together into larger particles, which is the same process that occurs when we burn wood in a fire, that\u2019s why we have the word combustion.\n\nThere are two main kinds of space radiation the ones responsible for the heating of the plasma are the solar wind and cosmic rays, but most of this radiation is so small it is not felt on Earth, but it is what makes up the vast super heated space plasmas that we see.\n\nThe plasma on Earth is the one that is cooled to form a solid object, that\u2019s why when we use a match to light a piece of paper that is in the same room we use as a torch the paper will not burn, it is not possible for the piece of paper to become plasma.\n\nIf we were to place the paper within the earth\u2019s magnetic field it would be surrounded with an external magnetic field and the magnetic field would prevent the plasma from forming, it doesn\u2019t matter how hot the plasma is, or how much radiation in a given unit of time it produces if there is no magnetic field it will not become super heated or burn.\n\nThis is the mechanism which differentiates the space radiation from the terrestrial ( ) radiation, the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is a magnetic field protecting it from radiation, by building a shielding around the planet.\n\nThe sun is a plasma source, the sun is powered by its own radiation this is how it is able to continuously power it magnetic field.\n\nSun has solar flares which can be considered as a source of

{"id":2354,"ended":true,"length":525,"text":"Many bacteria can move using a variety of mechanisms : flagella are used for swimming through fluids ; bacterial gliding and twitching motility move bacteria across surfaces ; and changes of buoyancy allow vertical motion in the absence of flagella.\n\nIn our study, we focused on the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, which is a rod shaped anaerobic bacterium, with thick endoplasmic reticulum (ER), small vacuole, and mitochondria. The rod-shaped nature and the thick ER may help in swimming, but are not required.\n\nThe rod-shaped nature of Bacillus subtilis makes it one of the best studied bacteria for swimming. Indeed, several studies have shown that swimming motility is a key feature of bacteria and it plays a major role in understanding the biology of bacteria. Bacterial swimming is very important for bacteria to survive : in an aquatic environment, bacteria are likely to move rapidly in the fluid to acquire nutrients or avoid predators or toxins.\n\nIn our study, we have used a combination of optical, spectroscopic, and microscopical techniques to obtain information on the movement of B. subtilis using a technique known as photo-voltammetry. Using this technique, we observe the electric current produced by the B. subtilis when the bacteria is exposed to light. We observe that the current fluctuates in an oscillatory fashion as the bacteria swim at different speeds.\n\nOur observation shows that bacteria tend to move when exposed to light: when the bacteria are exposed to light, the current generated by the bacteria oscillates as it swims. The observed currents are at a high potential, between a few and a few tens of volts. The current is generated by the B. subtilis, and the generated currents are then transmitted through the fluid, and then finally absorbed by the medium. The B. subtilis moves at a slow speed but generates a high current.\n\nWe also observe that when the bacteria swim at a slow speed, the currents associated with the bacteria remain high even when no light is received. This is consistent with the suggestion that the B. subtilis moves in the same direction as the light source (for example sunlight ).\n\nOur measurements show that the swimming behavior of B. subtilis is similar to that of E. coli, which has flagella and swims by twisting. However, unlike E. coli, B. subtilis moves by a combination of flagellum and oscillatory motion of the bacteria. Thus, while it is a member of the order Actinobacteria and has flagella, B. subtilis does not possess flagella the way many other bacteria have.\n\nMoreover, the observed motion is similar to that observed for bacteria that are motile by means of electrical potentials, such as L. pneumophila. Based on our measurements, we suggest that bacterial swimming through the fluid could be an ancestral form of swimming and that this could be the reason why bacteria have evolved numerous locomotion systems.","token_len":626,"entropy":[10.8152,3.0048,6.2927,8.2289,2.5978,1.6988,0.0007,1.886,10.2025,7.5396,0.7715,1.2974,4.5559,4.6851,1.8927,6.8512,5.788,5.682,4.1445,5.7518,7.68,5.6412,3.6742,8.9253,0.1544,8.1685,0.2106,7.8334,5.1548,4.8074,1.3431,1.9379,1.1202,6.6672,3.8607,7.8685,0.0317,5.5594,10.3811,3.4365,3.0694,2.1566,8.5653,0.0064,6.8019,0.038,0.3453,1.0144,1.98,0.037,3.5416,4.5546,1.7118,0.3556,1.1461,4.2516,0.2192,1.255,3.7748,9.0991,0.0028,0.9647,0.0016,0.0048,1.9236,0.878,1.2549,2.4352,10.2035,6.43,6.2008,0.8325,0.4083,1.3403,0.0014,2.5898,3.8251,8.1532,6.5665,3.5786,0.0412,0.0165,0.0496,0.0427,0.0776,1.8198,0.9279,2.7286,5.5838,7.3936,0.0177,1.6083,2.78,0.6072,6.7012,0.0449,0.9798,1.9066,5.9543,2.1022,0.477,7.2815,4.709,2.0689,6.249,3.3694,5.713,2.965,3.1815,6.2864,2.2754,1.6875,4.3547,1.149,2.908,2.8458,2.5192,0.0003,2.2961,4.2841,0.6494,0.0731,2.2914,0.4965,2.0471,0.0013,0.0096,0.0012,0.0002,3.6461,0.211,4.8975,0.0166,0.0682,3.8933,3.8559,2.0748,1.3778,1.5176,1.0271,6.4667,0.0638,4.9491,1.2894,0.4949,0.7131,0.3203,4.3186,10.1777,0.0775,1.4553,3.0653,1.8317,3.3547,0.2671,4.5622,3.2778,4.144,4.8449,0.4256,2.5075,0.0459,0.0662,6.5169,1.4168,4.0246,0.1365,4.47,0.5327,5.5045,1.2817,2.9483,1.4266,4.2395,3.1854,0.7956,5.3332,1.6125,2.735,8.2727,3.4561,4.2674,3.0457,0.3411,0.4754,2.1461,2.0847,4.4868,0.0548,3.1727,3.4728,2.8791,1.8823,4.4749,3.8614,6.0667,2.1138,3.2537,5.6297,1.742,3.936,4.8374,0.425,1.9725,0.0004,2.2227,1.4285,0.4523,0.1717,0.6117,4.7549,2.5713,1.466,4.0286,0.0138,6.5131,3.126,5.2046,0.0794,0.335,0.3354,0.1228,5.6153,2.4851,0.2043,1.2991,0.2341,4.7161,4.1276,1.0225,0.5355,3.6294,0.2452,3.2663,0.1866,0.0052,0.013,0.0002,5.203,1.6331,5.2085,1.7021,0.0113,6.0447,1.8886,6.5984,5.7826,0.0998,0.6844,3.9118,1.4267,1.0723,0.1803,0.3802,5.4541,1.1388,8.7143,2.2177,4.2729,0.2505,0.9368,3.8809,0.0563,0.0017,0.0082,0.0003,4.7066,2.3013,3.1692,3.6082,3.7111,0.0488,1.7018,1.0871,1.9657,3.3409,1.9299,0.8765,3.1605,6.2588,0.0081,2.682,2.9203,3.0626,1.4554,1.5437,2.9429,0.6972,0.8963,0.9401,5.4109,1.9586,0.6364,0.8466,1.5219,0.0003,3.0343,4.7145,2.966,0.1501,3.329,5.7248,0.0233,1.2088,3.5334,1.6209,0.021,0.6118,3.8975,2.48,1.3861,1.5067,1.9012,1.0132,0.0651,1.0564,0.5346,1.1903,2.6349,7.1872,0.2762,0.3122,0.9643,3.9453,0.0073,3.5235,1.3434,3.5368,0.0057,0.9865,2.0701,4.6715,4.1935,1.197,5.0492,1.8477,2.7242,6.442,1.5541,7.3256,4.5332,2.2003,1.5721,1.4584,0.2383,3.7317,0.1007,2.4632,0.7534,1.9158,2.3326,1.6085,4.0266,0.9315,0.7292,2.4919,0.006,0.0026,0.0044,0.0003,2.4178,1.8513,1.7812,8.8015,0.7482,0.7666,4.6227,3.3589,2.1935,0.3598,4.456,2.8946,3.2498,2.9371,6.0647,6.1238,0.6512,0.1826,8.276,1.1289,1.7819,3.5005,0.0012,0.0007,0.004,0.0004,3.8582,2.0347,0.8273,4.2778,1.4382,5.2323,6.0692,1.6664,2.7347,1.4925,1.6821,1.1344,0.0003,2.4881,2.2206,1.7624,0.6257,2.8916,0.5575,0.8188,1.3377,1.4271,1.3999,2.7417,0.3797,0.2303,0.6185,2.5391,7.1615,0.005,0.542,2.7955,5.3069,3.4282,3.9837,1.4025,6.1665,2.9247,0.2093,4.1592,0.5987,1.6047,1.4248,2.6694,0.0076,0.7148,5.6497,0.4161,1.1288,1.7556,0.0015,0.0013,0.0038,0.0003,3.2616,2.5278,2.2228,2.3661,0.7839,0.6872,0.9884,1.4501,3.5509,3.7343,4.8908,0.4428,10.1076,5.4268,1.027,0.0003,2.7802,4.5404,1.688,0.1457,0.748,5.9601,2.3714,0.2779,1.1111,0.0012,0.0005,0.0023,0.0002,0.7729,2.3249,0.0967,0.4353,0.2905,5.6938,0.0729,0.1378,1.5348,1.5619,2.5435,7.5256,0.0311,0.5063,2.4334,6.3617,1.3471,4.5438,7.0153,3.3555,2.8814,0.02,4.3746,0.5685,0.0008,0.0024,0.1236,0.7996,0.0006,0.0012,0.003,0.0003,3.9558,2.4174,2.9123,5.2515,0.0079,3.9583,0.0028,1.9493,2.8364,0.972,7.4477,0.8687,1.6846,4.0344,0.6585,1.3376,0.3769,4.6784,0.1547,4.0752,3.096,1.2287,3.4904,4.8751,0.0012,0.4195,4.7478,7.4189,0.033,0.606,0.2269,2.9511,3.3333,2.7678,0.0026,1.9551,0.3978,1.5381,0.0004,0.0009,0.003,0.0004,1.8602,0.0146,5.545,2.1289,0.0022,1.0672,8.6685,1.2033,4.986,0.668,1.1434,2.889,0.5671,0.6973,0.0003,6.1347,0.0064,1.5343,4.7518,5.6504,3.333,3.3006,0.0526,0.5362,2.3626,2.17,3.1121,1.7719,1.83,8.4305,0.2027,3.6578,4.3786,0.0066,5.4162,6.255,0.6224,1.9969,0.8911,0.0028,5.3901,1.9808,3.3069,1.4461,0.3598,0.9983,6.5646,0.0221,1.1745,2.5604,0.3181,1.0091,3.0106,0.0428,4.8175,1.6097,6.1095,1.6523,1.1641,3.6856,0.6769,2.9094,8.9793,2.6387,0.038,1.9338,3.8891,1.326,2.2308,2.5331,1.2906,1.9241,3.3154,0.7454,1.9452,2.3305,1.867,7.4422,5.2915,1.3383,1.7295,0.823]}
{"id":4637,"ended":true,"length":576,"text":"On September 1, a subtropical storm became Tropical Storm Emily southwest of Bermuda. Emily moved northeast, crossing the island the next day, but measured winds were below tropical storm force. Emily then began to intensify, and turned south. The eye passed over Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Emily intensified rapidly, becoming a hurricane at 2330 EDT on September 4, with sustained winds of 75 MPH (120 KM\/h), and an estimated minimum barometric pressure of. The hurricane made landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, at around 1200 EDT, with maximum sustained winds of 75 MPH (120 KM\/h). Emily was later absorbed by a developing tropical wave moving across the Southeast.\n\nTropical Storm Emily formed from the remnants of Hurricane Bret in the central Atlantic Ocean on August 11. The system dissipated near the Azores on August 16.\n\nAfter a stationary period, Bret intensified slightly while moving parallel to the Atlantic coast of Canada, becoming a Category 1 hurricane on August 13. The storm made landfall near Prince Edward Island that afternoon with winds around 100 MPH (155 KM\/h). It gradually weakened shortly before entering the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and then struck Newfoundland the following day and became a tropical storm. At the time, Bret was located near the northern tip of Newfoundland where it weakened. Bret exited Newfoundland the next morning as a mild tropical depression.\n\nBret was originally going to hit Greenland. Due to the lack of wind shear, Bret's interaction with warmer temperatures and increased storminess in the Labrador Sea allowed for strengthening for only nine hours. However, as it tracked towards northern Canada on August 13 and 14, the northern end of the storm was hit by counterclockwise wind shear which brought it down to a strong tropical storm. As a result, Bret was able to maintain some of its strength and made landfall on the east portion of the Island of Newfoundland on August 14 as a Category 1 hurricane. Its hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 35 miles (55 km), making the storm a major hurricane. The storm then moved along the coastline and weakened near the city of St. Johns. It dissipated near Halifax, Nova Scotia, after making another landfall on August 15.\n\nCategory 1 Hurricane Bret made landfall near the town of St. John's, Newfoundland on August 14, 1998. While Bret was moving north, an extra-tropical cyclone formed with an area of enhanced and sheared conditions, allowing Bret to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane. Around 04:00 EST, August 14, Bret made landfall in Newfoundland with winds estimated at 80 to 95 MPH. As it moved off the eastern coast of Canada, Bret weakened and became a tropical storm, which dissipated in Labrador after reaching the Atlantic Ocean. The cyclone was an extratropical storm for most of its life cycle. The extratropical low was absorbed by a large trough of low pressure that reached the Atlantic and Eastern North America states on August 15.\n\nThe strongest hurricane on record in Newfoundland was Hurricane Bret of 1998, which reached a Category 4 rating.","token_len":626,"entropy":[7.5319,3.3731,0.45,4.1861,11.7758,4.4207,0.0146,0.4951,7.1057,5.73,0.2817,7.4865,9.5769,0.0403,5.6141,1.1456,3.298,3.5257,2.9653,2.8492,6.7329,0.4671,5.4759,6.9746,1.4729,0.1387,1.478,3.6599,8.853,5.465,5.3832,4.437,7.2796,1.1462,2.5,0.8547,2.6767,2.6061,4.2897,1.0094,5.7592,1.2426,2.2998,6.0638,2.1636,2.2425,1.9994,7.6916,6.2989,1.8452,6.6757,1.4046,0.0515,1.0288,2.9723,0.5182,1.695,6.3629,5.7783,4.5168,1.7785,3.7281,1.4564,2.9077,3.5196,5.6878,7.2518,6.1531,1.6251,0.4308,2.6841,1.2951,3.9466,3.8493,0.0294,0.3699,4.8545,2.9228,2.1614,3.3923,4.2307,0.6161,1.1652,1.8735,1.9101,3.4899,2.4824,6.1645,8.415,0.8852,0.0523,0.1571,8.5922,1.6632,2.9538,4.8509,0.0302,3.5441,3.7551,6.9317,0.0154,0.6429,3.5896,0.0292,0.5231,2.3377,4.7648,5.3173,0.4787,1.7278,2.1734,3.1819,0.4573,0.063,0.1333,3.3044,0.1052,0.0251,0.8373,0.0189,0.0031,0.0028,0.6553,2.4465,2.4266,4.0872,7.6238,0.2826,2.5958,7.9586,2.1014,7.5491,6.7126,4.3464,0.3278,5.9251,1.7267,1.2449,0.0053,5.2178,0.213,0.0172,0.2382,0.7673,5.4586,3.2337,1.469,3.3785,0.0059,2.1779,11.2474,2.3339,1.4279,5.3075,1.791,1.3206,2.1127,2.5826,3.3567,2.1038,1.2811,7.2019,8.1428,0.0066,5.3502,1.4726,7.727,0.0227,3.4427,0.8115,2.8441,1.8689,2.4422,0.0003,5.449,2.2929,9.8988,4.3831,1.3302,10.3256,4.7547,4.7555,6.434,2.1058,8.5047,0.129,0.4108,2.7496,3.5546,2.8753,4.7834,1.4667,3.4017,0.4629,2.9862,2.48,0.1795,0.6661,0.9169,4.4126,0.4301,1.5667,1.4935,3.9246,0.0293,1.766,5.744,0.5053,0.0064,7.4836,2.3998,3.6439,2.71,5.6021,2.8907,0.2008,0.0129,3.8072,0.0333,0.006,0.0033,0.5087,3.0372,5.3702,3.5345,7.479,1.8459,4.6431,0.5319,2.8147,0.1179,5.4803,0.0242,0.1257,0.7688,2.5815,2.1512,5.547,4.0145,5.3868,1.1261,0.4314,4.1932,4.4319,0.2224,2.5803,0.1944,1.4921,4.5386,2.2194,0.7687,1.4142,1.994,0.6848,5.1491,2.9596,1.1242,3.7932,1.2604,0.0022,2.2057,6.1411,0.5556,4.6054,3.1576,3.7391,8.7175,1.9451,3.5676,1.0646,2.252,4.3408,0.7464,7.4595,1.767,5.2056,1.3901,0.6226,0.0002,4.2088,0.0516,2.1566,5.6377,6.1491,0.1559,3.3804,5.8097,3.8169,6.0737,0.0203,1.4216,3.6117,0.0009,2.3167,2.8247,4.1797,1.0449,3.9125,3.5754,9.4419,0.0595,8.8346,4.0828,2.1023,3.2452,2.6646,3.8197,3.3914,0.6273,6.1235,1.4028,4.2123,2.7808,7.2091,5.5599,7.0912,7.0851,1.9195,0.6675,2.6545,0.039,3.0319,2.9681,8.072,3.7838,5.2261,2.512,2.711,0.9298,3.1984,3.0475,7.0723,0.1182,1.5285,6.9902,3.2141,0.1556,0.2429,1.4368,2.4188,5.0537,0.5719,9.9811,3.7264,0.0003,2.2516,2.1109,0.0095,4.4356,4.7308,1.4605,3.7054,1.079,1.8051,5.871,3.5276,0.7582,1.6269,3.988,1.7291,0.3251,0.3217,2.1859,1.9014,3.1972,0.0058,4.3354,4.5773,2.0971,0.5266,1.1041,2.7285,5.3003,0.3577,1.8583,0.9891,3.17,8.5798,0.0019,1.0454,5.2885,0.8797,1.2724,1.1778,0.3645,2.2276,4.9758,0.1983,1.1934,1.5508,0.1495,0.2609,5.5977,4.8852,3.5679,0.1048,0.4995,5.5201,5.133,4.7953,0.8695,5.7691,1.5029,0.5106,2.8112,0.2158,2.7193,3.0152,4.1654,1.037,1.8727,4.1698,0.8739,1.2846,2.3477,0.9812,2.7154,1.374,4.2061,0.7075,4.8423,2.8917,5.0912,4.7795,1.1766,4.8973,0.0138,3.0115,0.0642,4.0795,2.5331,2.9636,7.6629,0.0006,2.0738,3.9756,0.9276,0.2436,0.0002,0.789,5.5888,2.6783,8.1019,0.9666,1.4466,1.0609,1.4577,0.4263,0.3936,0.0002,6.5917,1.315,2.1532,3.1515,3.8498,0.0645,2.2971,1.6138,3.9877,0.0053,3.4479,0.1702,1.3623,1.6715,1.5948,0.7878,0.7208,0.2955,3.7729,1.89,8.3989,0.3301,4.5666,3.6067,1.225,2.6806,2.1976,1.8333,5.1424,7.4265,2.717,0.0377,0.0055,4.093,0.0084,2.3972,4.6712,3.5154,2.5899,0.6872,7.7818,5.3601,8.1694,4.0954,7.0014,2.134,5.2623,2.8591,0.057,3.6845,4.2029,0.3866,0.9083,1.2489,0.1364,0.7917,7.2625,7.6873,1.8527,1.0701,3.3629,1.0385,10.2745,2.0858,0.2189,2.2132,2.2968,0.1622,1.4483,1.9017,3.0186,1.8483,5.5839,0.9507,3.6331,4.3771,3.1255,0.4367,6.2143,4.128,1.6907,1.2673,5.9258,0.644,3.5988,0.5249,0.4199,2.1753,0.3194,2.4678,2.9918,2.089,3.3181,0.1217,1.0992,0.1023,2.1577,3.6181,7.8498,0.0035,2.6239,7.1371,4.7359,3.6212,1.2422,3.356,1.5137,0.5956,2.1153,4.7417,0.0427,2.0979,5.594,6.5358,0.0403,0.0125,0.0129,1.2859,5.9596,3.5976,0.042,1.4852,2.6468,3.453,1.1438,2.2911,8.1832,0.0007,0.0017,0.0702,7.1033,3.1684,9.2104,0.316,0.9384,3.2868,5.5909,2.3098,3.3414,0.4876,2.4903,3.9168,1.3437,2.1293,3.036,7.5582,4.399,1.0796,9.9112,1.5787,0.3129,1.5639,0.5302,0.9854,0.0002,2.1172,5.1523,1.8783,2.8477,0.1572,2.3037,5.4434,1.3053,1.5007,5.6916,5.2626,3.5086,1.2787,0.571,4.4549,2.3954,2.3317,1.8556,4.8814,1.9168]}
{"id":4081,"ended":true,"length":549,"text":"On June 3, precautionary alerts were raised across the southern Baja California Peninsula and much of Western Mexico, due to potential impacts from the hurricane. Two days later, the Government of Mexico declared a state of emergency for the areas affected, including the towns of Ensenada, Tecate, Mexicali, Tijuana, San Diego, Topolobampo, Rosarito, Ensenada, Los Cabos, La Paz, Los Barriles and Santa Rosalia. Public health authorities began providing technical assistance to the Government of Mexico.\n\nThe official bulletin issued by the Government and the health ministry was translated and widely circulated within the United States as a health alert. Mexican authorities said the alert was meant to help residents of the Baja prepare and plan for possible emergency situations. The government requested that people take extra precautions to be prepared for possible storm-related injuries, health conditions, health risks to vulnerable populations, and possible disruptions to food and water supplies. People were urged by the government to practice safe evacuation, have a plan in place, and to closely monitor local media outlets for updated weather conditions that could affect their areas.\n\nHowever, Mexican public health authorities did not explain why and to what extent the health alert was triggered, how long it would remain in effect, which specific risk factors were the basis for the alert, where in Mexico the alert was issued, what it was originally intended to alert the public about, or how public health officials were coordinating with the Mexican government during the storm to implement the health alert.\n\nWhat is also unclear is whether Mexican health advisories are coordinated with similar alerts on the U.S.-Mexican border and the northern Mexican states or whether such alerts simply duplicate existing U.S.-Mexican notices and advisories.\n\nIn this health alert, Mexican authorities specifically said that anyone with respiratory tract infections such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema can experience difficulty breathing and may need to seek emergency attention if the hurricane \u201cproceeds toward Baja California\u201d and if the storm reaches the Baja California Peninsula, \u201cthere is a strong risk for local emergencies such as the deterioration of the oxygen supply on the respiratory lines, with the consequent risk to the health of the local population.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mexico issued the health alert to residents of the northern Mexican states of Baja California Sur and Sinaloa, we at the Trans-Border Institute were not able to trace any public health advisories or advisories issued after June 3 for conditions specific to the Baja California Peninsula. The Trans-Border Institute contacted the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C. to ask these questions. In an email response to our query, the embassy offered no explanation for the June 3 alert. While the embassy did not respond to followup questions, Mexican public health authorities told reporters that they would begin posting updates on Twitter every hour.\n\nMexican authorities did not respond to this fact check via a Facebook inbox or Twitter, and we did not receive a response to an email query sent by phone.","token_len":626,"entropy":[7.6025,3.3363,0.2511,16.2789,0.009,9.9737,0.3374,6.8133,5.643,0.7514,6.6224,7.1203,3.8084,0.2853,3.6082,2.6482,7.3317,0.0552,4.7071,3.1424,1.5691,6.1382,0.0783,4.7365,4.1284,1.2635,1.5936,4.5012,0.5928,5.8765,3.5617,0.2985,0.1955,1.7017,8.0005,0.2202,1.9213,3.0916,0.6655,0.741,0.0244,0.0596,2.3583,1.1068,4.5091,0.7834,1.9005,2.3798,1.5784,5.2452,0.1244,6.2622,0.3253,0.0394,1.4218,6.0676,0.2122,1.3584,6.7745,0.5147,0.001,0.4903,4.0887,3.5615,0.4752,3.4846,3.0746,0.4294,8.0176,2.3275,8.6737,13.6284,0.6924,0.3721,6.5679,2.9092,0.0523,0.3636,6.6422,0.0564,0.0253,0.4005,6.2291,2.7767,0.1404,0.3815,4.2435,1.5783,0.1835,0.3028,5.4877,9.988,8.5765,2.027,4.1707,5.4106,5.1059,0.3875,7.4435,1.4759,2.4496,4.5483,3.8428,6.3548,0.5174,0.5606,1.785,6.4003,0.1635,0.1823,1.9008,0.943,0.0019,2.0465,6.4469,7.2469,2.9133,1.6458,0.2682,2.8249,6.71,1.3369,7.0572,3.0991,3.5332,6.7196,2.4089,6.8161,0.8231,4.9822,0.4656,4.5574,0.042,3.6298,1.0734,7.6024,2.8813,1.5174,7.7828,1.9649,4.5774,1.7204,3.2634,0.9495,4.7898,0.1799,2.7896,3.0086,1.7554,1.3512,6.0032,0.0034,16.1873,4.0744,3.5914,0.1766,2.3977,4.8788,1.0285,0.6547,1.9833,2.9794,6.3166,1.1457,2.8748,4.1645,3.4973,0.6094,1.4335,4.3098,1.2403,0.3492,2.2593,4.1421,2.1141,0.1935,3.7056,1.9413,5.3127,3.3892,1.1828,5.0649,3.6548,2.4458,7.2796,1.5391,0.8392,0.348,4.049,4.9307,0.4869,4.0909,1.3365,1.1398,0.2933,0.3536,5.3785,1.8011,1.4845,6.8513,1.4704,1.8367,0.1303,7.0842,2.6432,5.8939,2.9989,6.8767,2.187,2.9031,1.8584,0.1648,1.4617,0.2588,3.5337,8.0903,0.4545,3.6504,2.7438,3.921,1.6606,6.4,3.8709,1.489,6.2226,1.3992,1.6756,0.8322,5.4911,0.4838,0.4449,0.0002,5.8591,0.0185,5.7995,4.9857,0.0537,1.4032,2.7449,0.0445,5.8086,1.6587,5.9014,4.7799,0.3033,0.1099,1.2704,3.48,0.3542,0.4626,5.8294,1.9039,4.1487,2.2781,0.3899,2.5679,4.1188,0.6668,0.2568,0.2119,5.3427,4.2671,6.3072,1.7273,1.8787,5.3922,3.9164,0.3725,0.6295,1.126,0.2679,5.5886,4.2113,3.7746,1.9695,1.4835,0.8191,1.0717,0.3974,3.088,3.8906,0.8064,6.6671,1.1293,0.2675,5.2587,3.3704,0.4236,1.8513,0.3486,2.0463,1.5361,6.2238,0.1416,1.6005,2.4045,4.3195,0.7775,1.4567,2.8711,0.8438,4.4624,0.3393,3.6733,3.7835,5.2959,0.5787,3.3104,0.1601,0.1855,0.4997,0.0002,5.5605,1.4449,5.9098,2.77,0.2578,1.3037,5.5404,1.6091,9.433,0.0006,1.8495,6.4432,0.5162,6.6513,3.2126,6.0219,1.3939,2.5728,0.001,0.0028,1.8681,2.6617,0.0404,0.0395,3.3603,2.3137,5.9409,2.6792,3.6122,4.9817,1.6461,4.1023,0.9757,7.0552,7.3689,3.5081,4.1887,0.0007,0.0016,1.0289,0.5849,0.0022,9.4126,2.3061,3.8476,0.0001,0.7298,0.9102,0.0002,2.7214,4.5562,8.4957,0.2386,0.3922,3.5714,1.7962,6.1024,4.0021,0.7908,5.702,2.1114,5.9503,4.6558,0.8134,4.955,0.0024,2.8438,0.6837,3.4418,0.732,0.004,0.0326,0.195,1.3258,5.5592,0.0035,0.0,0.0001,4.9434,4.3669,5.4028,0.3916,1.9405,1.7623,2.2343,1.5681,3.4263,2.0786,6.9428,2.6458,3.1834,8.4798,13.1752,7.8386,9.6739,0.9718,0.0294,4.685,9.2057,0.0037,0.0281,2.5991,7.9688,3.589,4.887,1.7316,3.3921,4.6059,1.2174,3.2304,0.0023,0.296,3.0453,2.6478,12.9794,0.1464,5.0647,1.4051,0.9218,4.6045,2.747,2.2555,7.2777,6.6043,2.5213,0.0026,3.2285,8.2055,0.0541,1.9973,7.2133,0.5189,5.2838,0.8106,8.8268,6.1972,2.0111,6.1332,2.313,6.2865,0.0175,2.8216,3.3374,1.5993,1.5365,0.4296,1.8321,3.8622,0.562,0.6353,7.2882,5.5194,0.4339,0.0002,4.5216,4.1003,4.6315,1.8691,1.0952,0.1089,3.2081,2.5637,0.5695,0.7485,4.2015,1.9671,0.2683,1.4924,2.6619,0.0005,0.1933,11.3328,1.5698,4.2734,0.0847,0.0,0.8531,7.4009,7.063,1.6732,9.1444,1.2682,3.8003,4.6287,3.7459,1.3147,0.573,0.0073,6.0599,2.4986,4.817,0.1727,2.857,0.0024,2.2766,3.8427,0.0024,1.1384,4.701,3.04,0.2723,4.4076,8.1163,7.9489,0.016,0.9062,2.1881,0.0019,0.065,1.0863,0.8915,2.8253,4.3624,0.0026,0.0055,0.1009,5.9193,0.781,1.6135,4.2902,0.4159,1.3456,0.7469,0.2926,0.0004,0.0008,2.1962,1.4601,3.2625,8.2116,0.7691,1.0103,3.382,2.2838,0.5855,2.8508,1.2665,2.1113,3.9356,0.1826,0.5818,4.0183,5.8472,2.199,2.6496,0.5891,0.7408,7.606,0.2064,4.5867,1.2064,5.8222,1.3689,2.9114,1.7956,0.9046,1.9419,0.3116,5.4246,3.5421,0.5267,1.0729,4.9927,2.8475,0.0069,0.5845,4.4708,6.6913,0.8242,1.5989,2.999,5.3452,5.6626,2.6224,1.0635,2.3166,6.1621,3.3445,2.4137,0.489,0.0002,5.2665,0.0818,2.0398,2.3253,0.2156,1.5679,0.0518,5.4956,7.2545,2.6048,6.6513,4.2172,4.5009,10.0584,1.7503,2.7821,2.7084,1.7359,2.357,2.1439,0.0211,0.8392,1.368,0.3719,0.8101,2.8159,0.7995,5.8626,2.159,1.7531,6.0049,2.0246]}
{"id":2894,"ended":true,"length":579,"text":"There are currently three recognised tournaments that are considered `` major `` by the IBAF : the World Baseball Classic, the Summer Olympic Games and the Baseball World Cup. Of those, the World Baseball Classic is the only one that is held once every four years. The other tournaments, the Summer Olympic Games and the Baseball World Cup, are held bi-annually, once in each year.\n\nEach year, the top ranked official countries are invited to compete in the World Baseball Classic. For example, in 2013, the Netherlands were the top ranked official team.\n\nThe tournament has three phases: the group play, play-off rounds and the final play-off. Each of these phases is divided into groups. The top team in each group will advance to the next group where they will meet the second to fourth place qualifiers teams of the previous tournament. The winners of this phase will then face each other to determine the winner of the tournament. The losing teams of these group will then advance to the round of 16 in the next tournament where they will face the top ranked teams of the other tournament. The losing teams will then advance to the consolation round where they will play for third place of the second tournament and to face the top ranked team in the the Olympic Games\n\nFor example :\n\nIn 2013 the Netherlands were the top ranked team in the tournament. They were assigned Group 2 with Japan, Cuba and Italy. The final played out this way :\n\nGroup stage : Japan and the Netherlands finished first and second in their group, Japan advanced to the Semifinal, while the Dutch were given the third place in the group.\n\n- Semifinal: Japan and the United States were the top teams in the tournament ; they were the only ones to have won the World Baseball Classic before. Japan beat the American by 3-1, while the Dutch lost to Japan by 2-1. USA advanced to the final, while the Dutch were given the third place in the tournament.\n\n- Final: Japan and the Korean were the top teams in the tournament. Japan beat Korea by 1-0 in the final.\n\nThe tournament was held in 2006. The final was played out like this :\n\nGroup stage : Cuba and South Korea finished first and second in their group. Cuba advanced to the semifinals, while South Korea were given the third place in the group.\n\n- Semifinal: Cuba and Japan finished first and second in their group, they advanced to the final game of the tournament. Japan won by 4-2, thus giving a third World Baseball Classic title to the Japanese.\n\n- Final: USA and Japan faced each other. They both finished second in the group, however Japan won the group play with the highest point difference. The Japanese had the higher point difference because it was their final game, while USA and South Korea faced each other to determine which of them would go to the final. USA lost the game. The Japanese won the World Baseball Classic and took home the title.\n\nThe tournament has been held every four years since 2006.","token_len":626,"entropy":[3.4462,5.4092,3.6141,9.7735,8.6488,3.0859,1.7333,3.8977,12.1981,12.2151,5.803,3.83,0.6584,5.7142,3.4598,4.9181,6.7324,2.6398,2.563,3.9847,0.2602,0.8409,0.2532,6.0414,2.7971,0.2594,1.29,0.1568,4.7288,0.6391,0.587,0.4722,5.4565,1.9736,0.8703,1.158,1.8412,0.1724,0.0227,0.8718,0.4249,1.5336,1.1494,1.1054,1.3634,3.8243,5.1527,1.5371,2.2504,0.0527,0.7668,1.1357,2.4902,2.9858,2.3971,1.1767,1.3724,1.0033,0.0293,0.4786,0.1714,0.184,0.0017,0.0013,0.2061,0.445,0.9228,8.721,0.9113,0.1902,0.0048,1.9743,4.7231,4.4558,1.1982,0.8821,0.5559,2.6322,0.0015,4.5534,1.0073,0.6068,0.9374,6.0595,7.236,6.6978,8.511,2.1656,1.914,0.0979,1.6051,0.5213,0.8856,1.7083,0.0407,0.035,0.8127,4.3947,1.9938,0.0396,1.3995,4.0205,0.4165,1.1526,4.8472,4.3417,3.5232,2.4805,1.8556,3.4898,4.0681,2.8638,1.7373,0.0002,1.4371,2.9166,2.9692,3.9603,4.5976,0.8473,1.4331,6.7449,6.1244,1.0525,7.4605,0.8849,1.1878,4.677,0.7222,1.0584,1.7205,5.0758,0.1091,0.1083,2.1943,2.8396,2.974,0.8741,0.8824,1.4459,3.3359,0.0757,5.7464,2.384,1.1822,2.9691,4.0895,1.8802,0.2181,1.436,3.1752,0.9477,0.2142,0.1333,1.6213,2.6309,8.0146,1.1237,0.6586,3.1424,1.8914,3.0202,6.3218,3.6889,1.7367,9.7808,7.0961,3.9346,0.5137,2.3673,4.1778,0.2787,1.474,3.688,0.2442,3.6331,1.8123,0.7517,2.8075,2.9561,1.3735,0.6506,2.5083,0.7639,0.854,1.9638,0.3197,0.3041,2.6146,0.2142,1.7502,8.3917,1.7504,2.054,3.592,3.8152,4.3642,2.2844,2.7352,0.1222,0.1401,5.5437,0.2292,0.6476,3.6996,1.2691,2.5169,1.8427,2.6956,0.2116,0.2374,0.615,1.1007,3.2656,3.2341,1.5077,0.481,0.2485,4.0012,2.1887,0.2691,1.7916,7.3675,0.2074,1.6707,0.3467,1.8548,0.0628,0.0685,8.1523,1.0936,2.2007,0.115,0.1798,3.7218,3.4873,5.9345,0.0965,3.5688,0.1952,4.1941,3.397,2.4372,4.9645,5.0222,0.4814,1.3968,1.5144,1.859,2.4904,0.1958,7.8772,9.0454,1.2113,6.3445,0.0003,4.1555,2.9503,8.2413,1.1056,0.0003,3.3374,1.9749,2.6538,0.38,1.2474,0.8401,0.6469,0.2145,1.6052,1.0023,0.2659,2.3101,0.6723,1.9161,2.0259,8.4915,7.1613,4.1018,4.0931,4.9033,1.7592,6.2219,0.8469,4.9174,1.1325,1.7528,3.8275,6.1099,3.135,5.7757,0.5756,2.0732,0.6679,0.0003,2.4479,6.5759,2.9393,4.5515,3.3322,3.269,2.6103,5.0406,2.7217,1.3834,0.9731,1.5301,4.1349,0.2694,1.5424,5.3493,4.1795,0.333,0.3754,4.749,0.0494,1.9708,2.3682,3.3532,1.1486,5.0515,2.2448,4.6461,1.3374,3.4422,0.7897,2.7036,0.6146,2.3733,0.9892,1.2879,0.0002,4.9711,5.8041,0.0084,0.2502,1.9469,2.4335,1.4229,0.3206,5.8719,0.0608,2.165,1.8211,1.4723,3.714,0.5666,0.5845,0.688,7.9169,2.0925,1.2659,3.7302,2.0569,3.4234,0.9901,3.4902,1.804,0.901,3.1885,0.371,0.0235,4.7573,1.7747,4.6433,4.1983,0.6594,5.0019,6.3003,3.6491,1.0535,1.0078,1.8114,2.5775,0.3606,2.8524,2.7074,1.6511,3.7806,0.6257,1.0695,0.0128,0.5569,0.328,6.7621,3.5002,0.2552,0.0918,2.4631,2.3625,1.6621,0.7536,2.0811,1.5924,0.4537,0.3144,1.455,0.0584,0.3253,0.1369,3.0639,0.2215,0.3455,0.0002,0.4003,1.1191,0.2667,3.0811,1.5868,0.2639,8.89,2.8648,1.0563,0.9177,0.4954,0.334,0.2145,0.0501,1.2747,3.4478,0.7444,3.4821,0.2531,2.047,0.0174,0.4861,3.2374,0.4995,1.4778,1.7173,0.7465,0.0002,2.9561,2.9694,2.5893,1.0592,0.8552,6.0177,1.8393,1.5591,3.6678,1.5545,1.4045,3.1874,5.6054,0.3172,0.7905,0.1513,0.0003,1.2357,0.2988,0.1085,7.4939,1.5899,4.0816,0.0547,1.4542,0.5276,0.5121,0.2062,0.1747,0.1895,0.0824,1.7511,2.5296,2.0772,0.0602,0.0272,3.1536,1.0128,0.3444,0.7666,0.0237,3.3582,0.1948,0.1636,0.9222,0.0467,0.2435,0.0825,1.5472,0.071,0.2543,0.0002,0.1408,0.2694,0.0005,0.0435,0.0662,1.4464,0.5654,3.7636,2.6581,0.3934,0.1666,0.0192,0.0141,0.0257,0.0176,2.0569,4.7166,1.8537,0.034,0.0196,1.9682,5.9841,1.3361,0.1674,1.0276,0.559,2.6419,3.8754,1.0318,3.0307,0.0035,1.8912,1.2332,8.0701,3.4832,4.4905,4.7953,9.5961,0.243,0.0175,2.4944,2.0079,1.0296,5.024,0.8094,0.4796,0.0003,0.6039,0.6047,0.1201,4.932,0.7697,1.9928,5.2219,0.3356,0.0101,3.726,2.6044,3.1768,2.827,2.1986,1.1271,1.0172,0.7359,1.0771,4.9069,3.4932,2.1312,2.8949,3.6816,5.3666,3.9497,2.0851,6.4383,5.0685,4.4438,1.0593,2.2928,4.4132,3.1729,1.7255,5.534,0.8633,0.2846,4.2713,3.4683,0.4982,2.2742,4.6696,1.1006,1.8182,2.1364,1.8682,3.4844,2.0892,0.0313,5.1029,0.0744,0.0087,4.9598,1.9469,2.9436,2.2243,1.5723,0.4808,4.1305,2.4754,0.1167,1.4026,0.6953,3.219,2.7903,1.943,2.0325,3.8882,2.8019,3.1776,2.7319,0.729,6.8269,0.1048,0.0052,3.0131,4.4837,0.8766,0.3915,2.3802,0.5902,0.3382,0.0003,1.603,2.0706,2.5887,2.1157,0.7741,2.6291,1.4556,0.0193,0.8756,2.9441,0.4148]}
{"id":172,"ended":true,"length":497,"text":"Antimony has two stable isotopes : < unk > with a natural abundance of 57 @. @ 36 % and < unk > with a natural abundance of 42 @. @ 64 %. The stable isotopes are chemically identical but they differ in a neutron atom they contain, that affects the mass of the atom and therefore the nuclear properties. An atom with a higher number of neutrons is \"more stable\" (i.e. it has slightly greater half-life ). The heavier the atom, the smaller the ratio of electrons to neutrons (e\/ n). The stable isotope < unk > is relatively easy to obtain in large quantity because it only needs to be collected from the smoke of coal fires. The use of that isotope as a trace element in a synthetic element as in the case of antimony is difficult ; you need radioactive material and its decay :\n\na heavy radioactive material : to generate a neutrino that will produce an antino; or\n\na neutrino in itself that has both a proton and an antineutrino.\n\nSome radioactive materials that emit beta or gamma photons are used for this purpose. A heavy radioactive isotope like antimony-201 is used (it is the radioactive material in Geiger-M\u00fcller tubes). The result is a trace level of antimony in a synthetic element.\n\nBecause it is unstable in the environment where it is used, there is a limited natural abundance : 2.4 g \/ kg of soil (sadly almost all soil is covered by water). With modern technologies, it may become more abundant.\n\nOther natural isotopes exist : a few (like {Sb@5@4} and {Sb@36@3} ) are found in rocks.\n\nThere is also a synthetic element containing antimony : {Sb1, Sb2}Te. This is a compound of two semiconductors each consisting of two identical atoms : S of antimony and S of sulphur.\n\nChemical properties\n\nIts chemical formula is Sb0.92Te0.08. The chemical formula of SbTe compounds is Sb1-x Te0.8 where x is 2 or 3 @. Thus, one can distinguish SbTe3 (with three Sb atoms), Sb2Te3 (with two Sb atoms and two Te atoms) and Sb0.9Te0.1 (with one Sb atom and no Te atoms). Since the atomic masses of the antimony and TE atoms are the same, the atomic masses of the SbTe compounds are all equal to 2 @ +. In Sb0.92Te0.08 the atomic masses of the antimony atoms are equal to 2 @ + +.\n\nThe electrical resistivity of SbTe3 is 6 @. That of Sb0.90Te0.1 is 16 @. SbTe2 is more conductive because it is made of semiconductors but it is not as stable in temperature.","token_len":627,"entropy":[10.4733,4.744,6.4956,11.4776,6.6873,0.0464,7.9744,8.3627,10.6398,5.1436,3.6749,5.6874,2.2463,6.62,5.7616,0.7341,8.577,10.6413,5.1941,5.2478,8.9096,3.7969,2.3308,0.67,0.7295,0.0153,0.1558,0.2835,0.2077,0.184,0.2574,0.0188,4.7846,1.0367,0.2236,1.0923,5.547,0.3122,1.7905,2.7885,6.8395,0.0151,0.8787,1.0109,7.568,2.0888,2.9771,3.5327,1.5245,0.7173,3.2591,8.9639,5.4178,7.6279,3.269,2.8621,4.5737,8.9417,0.7241,4.7978,0.6422,0.4033,2.4252,2.0874,4.0184,1.0317,5.4731,6.0511,1.383,5.5242,2.9935,0.996,0.6713,4.0221,4.1697,0.0619,2.4284,0.0107,1.9052,6.3609,3.06,2.0275,0.5733,2.7526,2.9358,0.0037,0.0006,0.6639,2.4279,0.7872,6.6858,3.8711,7.4968,0.4935,0.1793,7.0331,1.8544,5.7455,1.8858,1.0581,0.676,0.0211,3.9592,0.3126,5.134,0.4986,4.9339,0.4482,2.3222,0.0145,2.4523,3.7451,12.5578,8.0566,3.4506,1.7404,3.1337,0.0161,1.8763,3.9666,0.8295,0.0062,0.2637,1.1387,5.839,4.525,0.0349,3.5632,2.9314,5.1693,5.4683,3.3718,1.1512,4.9033,4.1179,0.7013,0.3918,6.5904,2.4252,1.942,10.1838,1.9896,6.1473,3.5356,1.0958,1.7097,7.114,0.0207,6.4513,1.9491,0.0088,3.5213,0.4899,5.8141,0.4033,2.0262,3.0786,7.0639,5.4981,5.4751,3.9514,1.9397,4.7584,0.0115,6.8802,0.0295,1.2318,5.6535,8.4393,4.9347,1.6549,7.048,3.7591,3.3962,4.9144,2.0685,11.3104,4.5982,0.2858,5.9046,8.1134,4.0941,1.772,4.592,6.6341,5.371,1.4495,5.7422,0.8278,0.175,5.0145,2.976,2.9952,2.6466,1.946,10.2621,6.016,3.9445,1.5976,0.0003,0.9388,4.987,0.076,0.0344,4.5548,6.1772,2.8365,3.4584,6.0013,1.2325,3.4013,0.028,0.2389,1.6105,2.1378,1.8543,2.1586,0.2409,0.0076,1.7804,1.2653,0.0005,5.0138,3.6595,1.2086,3.6486,5.3604,7.3345,4.2682,2.4188,5.7292,1.7107,3.5231,1.9052,2.9451,0.2429,1.0017,3.5687,4.7926,1.1638,5.1342,0.0045,3.5517,4.3409,0.0087,5.9058,8.7087,2.1824,1.5977,5.5825,3.7803,1.1103,3.647,4.8051,1.5015,2.8496,9.9968,1.3765,3.6032,4.7806,2.9611,0.0613,6.5753,1.7824,2.0833,6.8792,0.4233,1.1388,5.5192,8.5146,1.0941,3.8528,0.0105,2.6932,2.0075,5.059,0.6455,1.2053,1.4844,0.0004,5.7888,2.8759,0.5585,6.21,2.629,1.7056,4.152,5.5043,0.2496,0.3951,1.9418,0.4736,3.4101,0.5193,1.3199,4.8421,6.3971,3.1842,6.3243,6.1795,1.9723,2.635,4.6377,4.0858,1.8178,1.9628,7.3435,3.0227,6.126,6.9401,0.9576,6.3917,1.8843,4.7442,1.0618,4.9695,1.4168,4.4167,1.4481,5.5259,6.1208,3.6928,0.9311,2.5555,4.5864,3.1695,2.6384,3.4557,1.3878,1.4195,0.0003,5.6916,4.0457,1.7861,0.1649,5.6385,1.7622,4.8329,3.5991,4.3292,3.7469,7.94,5.1114,5.9293,6.1377,5.0282,4.9347,3.2244,1.5059,1.5885,0.7765,1.3052,0.4,0.4145,7.2413,0.4504,2.3982,0.7119,1.6223,1.5902,3.6785,0.6161,4.3779,2.4014,2.4175,0.0003,3.7948,1.2885,2.2116,0.7735,5.9883,0.7957,6.2398,2.8265,0.0097,2.3128,3.493,1.0953,0.3306,6.7995,4.0886,1.332,0.1455,0.6036,0.768,13.316,3.1316,2.4449,1.0932,1.2674,5.705,1.0828,3.1493,7.5191,1.4676,0.3568,7.5419,3.5006,0.0296,1.9234,6.7325,1.9713,2.8977,2.3961,8.7343,4.7296,0.0069,0.8257,0.8405,1.1985,8.1456,0.5488,0.7645,1.8293,0.0004,5.8265,0.2419,3.5238,2.0508,0.0004,7.6838,2.1985,4.6663,0.6319,5.2987,1.0349,4.9068,1.493,6.8645,6.7091,5.482,0.3574,7.4813,2.3446,2.1128,3.4002,1.2455,2.2362,3.0058,0.0948,8.8155,10.2279,0.6322,2.0874,0.2461,3.4859,4.0687,7.7308,5.9565,1.2634,0.1375,3.2239,6.355,1.1461,0.8133,6.2565,4.261,1.7346,9.5904,1.3101,5.2798,0.9933,5.1849,2.2188,5.5164,3.0228,0.1587,1.8589,5.2458,4.0672,4.7821,5.6669,5.9178,0.4825,3.2611,2.5786,0.6042,0.0159,1.432,6.3659,0.9342,0.1936,0.3071,1.2448,0.2282,0.0128,0.0206,3.102,1.1515,6.7646,0.493,1.08,0.6129,0.2283,0.0139,4.4343,0.3899,3.098,0.4742,0.54,0.1868,3.4561,1.4279,0.2653,1.8866,0.5651,0.0077,0.5576,0.6225,5.7771,1.1748,0.4647,0.429,5.3505,1.5848,3.7168,4.9952,0.6431,1.4898,3.661,0.0314,2.2919,14.6022,1.1594,0.4234,2.6525,0.0333,0.3827,1.3451,3.2919,2.0895,0.3898,0.613,3.0065,0.1359,2.1193,3.4373,0.7657,5.7673,1.5532,2.8071,3.4797,2.4096,4.8336,5.186,3.7037,6.1146,0.039,1.6994,0.0633,0.5042,0.3226,0.1729,0.0321,0.095,2.1769,1.7545,0.7545,0.534,0.6085,2.0929,0.0037,3.4363,0.2821,1.8047,0.0586,1.4075,0.5042,0.5565,3.0837,1.8159,1.5061,0.0002,1.641,8.3044,6.2009,0.2086,0.3053,1.829,0.0216,0.3352,0.8202,0.9151,5.1659,4.0853,2.6448,4.7543,3.4681,0.3881,0.0053,1.2915,0.011,5.3855,0.1491,0.1864,0.0497,3.1062,0.3317,5.3414,1.1565,0.9292,3.787,0.0242,1.859,2.5543,1.627,6.1869,5.3463,0.0427,4.7087,1.3456,0.9247,4.5777,0.4966,6.0672,0.1032,0.226,4.8457,2.3013,0.7779,2.2924,2.1785,3.5339,2.1766,6.563,1.356]}
{"id":1195,"ended":true,"length":571,"text":"Hornung finished his work with the YMCA and returned to England probably in early 1919, according to Rowland. He worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health. His wife, Edith, who had been diagnosed as having stomach cancer a year before, died on Christmas Day 1920 at the age of 37 while she was undergoing an experimental procedure for treatment, the surgeon Charles Lillie successfully inserting four pieces of iced beef (she had had lost weight during prolonged sickness), without apparently appreciating that she was pregnant, and she was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery (in a plot marked on the cemetery register as being for \"Edith Hornung\", her two daughters and one son).\n\nIn November 1921, Hornung became ill with typhoid and it was assumed that his previous work had affected his health. In April 1923, aged 48, he travelled to America to receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Literature from the New York University (NYU) and was in the United States for three months. It was during this time that he started planning a new novel, which would also include his autobiography, which he wanted to begin in earnest when he returned to England.\n\nHornung and his family returned to England in August 1923, but he contracted pneumonia and remained in the infirmary at Kensal Rise until he regained his health in February 1924. Aged 50, he started working on the new novel again, although this time under the influence of the author Frank Meaney, whose autobiography Hornung had been reading.\n\nHornung wrote of Meaney in his autobiography that he\n\n...saw that the book could not be written without a great deal of personal experience. [At] age 50, I was now able to tell the story of my life with greater simplicity than at any earlier period of my existence. I could see that I had wasted the greatest part of my career. I came to the conclusion that I must be more careful and accurate in my work... My object was to see the best play it now possible to write...\n\nIn March 1925 Hornung and his wife were married in Kensal Hill Church and Edith gave birth to their first child, a son who died two months later during childbirth. In September, while still suffering from tuberculosis, Hornung started work on his memoir, and in November he died in his home on Mount St John's. The Hornung Estate was left to their son and a daughter. He was buried at Kensal Rise Cemetery.

{"id":1499,"ended":true,"length":578,"text":"A new paradigm called `` intelligent agents `` became widely accepted during the 90s. Although earlier researchers had proposed modular `` divide and conquer `` approaches to AI, the intelligent agent did not represent a significant breakthrough in the computer field. Although some of them were implemented by commercial vendors, the general approach has not seen any practical application due to a variety of problems including ( 1 ) the inability of the agents to collaborate ( 2 ) poor intelligence ( 3 ) difficulties in the execution of dynamic rules ( 4 ) the inability of the agents themselves to evolve ( 5 ) the fact that they require large amounts of memory to store all of their internal data and instructions ( 6 ) and the lack of distributed systems support ( 7 ) ( 8 ).\n\nThe authors present here an implementation and theoretical analysis of a new modular framework based on evolutionary theory applied to the problem of intelligent agents. The agents themselves are `` composites `` of a set of agents which are themselves composed of a set of agents which are themselves composed by modules that are in turn composed by agents. The intelligent agents have all the features of any other agent but they are modular so that they can evolve and become more intelligent, or less intelligent, according to the number and characteristics of agents composing them.\n\nAs an example, a network of intelligent agents could be used to maintain the integrity of vast databases in real time. Alternatively, an intelligent agent could be used as a component of a system for the distribution of computing tasks. An intelligent agent could even act as a mobile robot of an intelligent system, which constantly explores its environment and interacts intelligently with other systems.\n\nIntelligent agents are composed of agents, modules and algorithms. In order to create intelligent agents whose capabilities and behaviour are unpredictable, it is necessary to develop modules, algorithms and algorithms which react to the behaviour of the agents and to the characteristics of their own modules. The implementation of the algorithms themselves is a complex task and requires the development of general-purpose adaptive programming languages ( 9 ).\n\nThe modular approach for the development of intelligent agents will improve the reliability of their behaviour and allow the use of any agent in any module, as long as the latter contains all the required algorithms which are able to interact with the agents at the level of the subagents of the module.\n\nReferences 1.

{"id":4296,"ended":true,"length":598,"text":"Using the Gemini spacecraft for a manned Lunar landing was considered as early as the original Mercury Mark II proposal which led to the Gemini program. The initial proposal was for a Lunar orbiter that would launch into a lunar low Earth orbit, dock a separate manned service module, and leave the two together, traveling to the lunar surface as a unit. This approach, if successful, would have served to minimize any problems involved with returning an entire crew from the Moon to earth. The mission would have been a significant step in the space program, placing the United States in a category of nations with the ability to successfully use orbiter missions for reconnaissance, reconnaissance missions for landing craft development.\n\nFor the Apollo program, the manned lunar lander became the focus of attention and effort. Once again, as early as 1969, NASA was considering using the Gemini spacecraft as the basis for a manned Moon landing mission. By the time the moon race reached full steam, Gemini was recognized as a viable space vehicle for the Apollo program and was in service as both a spy satellite and a docking vehicle. The Gemini spacecraft also had the distinction of placing a manned vehicle in lunar orbit where it remained for 8 days. The use of a separate launch for the return would have reduced the risk of being lost without a trace and made flight management simpler.\n\nHowever, while Gemini could have been used to reach the Moon, it would have required a large amount of power, the use of a second spacecraft to return the crew and its considerable mass to earth would have increased the cost and difficulty of the endeavor. Ultimately the use of Apollo as the vehicle to reach the lunar surface made both the Moon and manned Moon-landing the obvious choice. The Gemini spacecraft would again be used by the Apollo program to carry the astronauts into space where they left on their first manned space flight into a lunar orbit. The mission was to land the astronauts at a site chosen by the Apollo crew and then return to earth, landing at a pre-arranged site of the Apollo mission for the purpose of picking up a fresh pilot for the return.\n\nThe Apollo program, in addition to requiring its own unique space mission plan, required its own unique capsule capable of carrying three astronauts to orbit at the same time. The spacecraft would be able to perform a maneuver which would dock it in an orbital plane and allow astronauts to be evacuated either horizontally or vertically into either a low earth orbit or a high altitude escape trajectory.\n\nThe first manned spaceflight to the Moon was an Apollo Mission and its launch and landing system was a modified Saturn V.\n\nThese two articles were written by NASA employees at the time of the Gemini program for consideration by NASA and are not NASA documents, which may be found in various collections at the National Archives, the Smithsonian, and NASA's Freedom of Information Act libraries.

The hull was constructed of oak and was covered in planking and sheathing. It was fitted with a two-bladed main-sails, fore and aft. The sails were of a different weave than those of the.@ 61 m ( 200 @. @ 16 ft 6 in ) ship of the line, the Stadt. It had two-bladed main- and mizzen-sails, both of a different weave than the mizzen-sails of the Stadt. It had two masts and a single poop-deck. The vessel was not as heavy as its predecessor; it has been calculated that her hull weighed 3,650 tons unladen. The ship carried 2,500 marines, but there was no deck armament.\n\nThe ship was built in Hamburg by Bohnen, Tiedemann und Schwerdtfeger, which was also the manufacturer of the Stadt. The first captain of the Prinz Adalbert was W. W. R. Krieg, who had served in the first Stadt. The Stadt served in the Danish fleet until early 1712; she was seized by the French during the Wars of the Spanish Succession, and was taken out of service in 1712 and served as a hulking hulk until 1715. Later the ship was bought by the Prussian state and sold to the Danish Crown-Prince, who served the ship as the flagship of the Danish Fleet in 1714.\n\nThe ship was captured by the French on 26 April 1715 while under the command of Captain Thomas Poyntz, when she was sailing from La Rochelle to Brest. The ship was scuttled and the French captured the crews. Poyntz was forced to surrender his flag to Captain Jacques Traviault. His ship was the only vessel to escape capture. The Prinz Adalbert was raised in 1719. In October 1731, the Prinz Adalbert was sold to the Danish state and was broken up in August 1733.\n\nSee Also:\n\nFor the French ship of the line Stadt.\n\nSources:\n\nHerold, G, Geschichte der Deutschen Flotte 1714-1797, Vol. III, Stuttgart 1898, pp. 551-554.\n\nSinkowski, E.

{"id":2432,"ended":true,"length":581,"text":"While the electric guitar was originally designed to be simply amplified in order to reproduce its sound at a higher volume, guitarists quickly discovered the creative possibilities of using the amplifier to modify the tone of the sound. As new tube amplifier designs were invented a new generation of acoustic guitar, acoustic amplifiers were invented, and guitarists began experimenting with their sounds. The guitar amplifier quickly became an essential \"tool\" for guitarists, and an important extension of the guitar's musical voice.\n\nThe basic design of modern electric guitar amplifiers continues to remain the same. However, the internal circuitry, amplifiers and power supplies have gotten faster and quieter due to increasingly high power factors. Amplifiers also now use more and more discrete semiconductor components that have very high power factor and allow a more linear relationship between output voltage to input voltage. Electronic components today can be made with significantly less heat and provide less electromagnetic interference.\n\nAn amplifier is a device that converts an acoustic signal into an electrical signal that can then be processed electronically in order to reproduce a sound. The output signal from an amplifier can be adjusted by the amplitude, tone, distortion, frequency response, and phase characteristics or by other electronic controls typically associated with guitar amplifiers. Most amplifiers include a power amplifier, a signal amplification module and a cab or speaker enclosure. A multi-channel multi-purpose guitar amplifier may also include effects circuitry, an internal tuner and a power supply. Amps can range in wattage capacity (such as 10 watts or 100 watts) and power capabilities (5 watts, 15 watts, 30 watts, 50 watts, 100 watts, 200 watts etc.). There are also high-gain (such as 1000 watts), high-volume (such as 150 watts), and large sound systems (such as 2000 watt).\n\nThe guitar amplifiers vary widely in both construction and functionality. Many models are tube-driven and include a power amp. While there are tube guitar amplifiers that can produce up to 200 Watts, less expensive solid-state models can provide sufficient volume for small to mid-size venues. There are also less expensive solid-state equivalents of the Gibson and Marshall lines.\n\nA guitar amplifier circuit is based on inductive and capacitive circuit elements. As the electric guitar's strings vibrate, they create a voltage source that is used to provide sufficient voltage required for the amplifier to operate. A guitar amplifier circuit usually has a speaker or speaker speaker and a microphone to amplify sounds from the guitar. Also, a switch is often provided on guitar amps for controlling amplifier power, tone, volume, bass, treble, phase and tone control.\n\nA speaker, microphone or headphones connected to an amplifier's microphone\/amplifier input may be used to perform the function of an amplifier, but this often results in a poor-quality sound. The better an amplifier sounds, the more useful a guitar amp is. Some guitar amplifiers are more suitable for studio and stage use than others. They can usually be turned on and off and they are usually powered from an external power source. Professional guitar amp modeling software may also be used.","token_len":629,"entropy":[2.2488,9.2439,5.5532,2.6085,4.3113,1.779,1.1465,0.8015,6.8405,8.0382,3.5197,3.6314,0.0302,4.3274,3.2763,2.6251,4.4475,1.5731,1.2276,1.0768,0.4252,5.7842,1.4299,3.5163,2.0842,2.2695,7.5363,2.7798,0.4894,2.4194,2.0227,4.591,1.5802,5.9923,0.7277,2.3915,0.5117,1.0202,2.3274,0.7401,4.0758,6.2211,6.9972,4.1862,1.5043,2.004,4.2066,7.5023,2.4757,4.344,0.0644,4.4237,0.7311,6.7443,5.5613,4.4989,0.002,1.5108,2.8661,1.7133,0.6989,3.6545,0.4138,1.1792,2.4714,0.0764,3.0083,4.8734,1.2873,2.3604,4.1712,3.8683,5.363,0.2908,2.714,2.3444,8.113,3.1931,0.2042,0.4715,2.642,0.1673,1.6068,1.1943,5.6161,1.7741,8.3513,0.2848,0.9162,1.4866,0.9859,3.3939,5.9078,0.3838,0.8197,0.0047,1.8674,6.3278,2.494,0.5389,6.2695,1.5035,0.5161,1.8386,0.0026,5.4593,0.2642,5.7464,1.0446,0.1908,1.262,2.9602,0.0476,1.7305,7.3816,2.6917,3.4452,6.1605,0.0363,1.717,3.3784,1.078,1.8728,5.9675,6.3917,0.6145,5.2739,5.2373,0.0099,6.2271,3.5514,2.3416,7.9814,0.8663,5.9687,0.1141,4.5298,3.8499,3.7571,2.2945,4.1441,0.1988,5.848,7.1063,0.1895,1.4605,2.8626,3.3074,6.3581,1.6036,2.0157,7.2653,1.5418,5.866,3.5681,2.1408,5.7557,5.2237,0.2046,3.4976,2.1324,5.3768,3.6222,0.3341,0.3517,7.4266,2.3722,5.3518,2.3739,1.7137,3.8368,3.0652,5.1225,1.8614,4.7113,1.0522,4.8183,3.3447,7.1571,1.2697,0.7757,1.3853,0.0002,5.3276,3.7116,2.0398,1.4048,3.1259,0.5662,3.7528,2.1615,3.1961,1.5483,0.7149,1.576,1.584,0.1347,2.5297,1.1773,3.0168,0.0456,4.8192,5.6736,2.9737,1.8677,0.0114,3.2143,2.3892,1.0264,0.6141,1.7539,4.7946,2.5723,2.5203,0.6627,0.3991,1.5922,0.691,5.6606,2.3479,1.6775,7.5374,1.9952,3.0926,0.7171,5.4351,0.6518,3.4124,2.217,0.6355,1.1275,3.4086,3.949,7.3735,1.7585,3.3389,5.4748,3.7323,9.5585,3.1747,0.0104,4.3945,1.9234,0.0076,0.2209,4.2413,2.5409,0.0008,4.1743,1.1663,3.0235,2.7057,1.6784,1.9248,5.6931,5.8583,3.9775,3.1494,0.9496,11.2533,3.8416,4.4456,4.7114,0.6623,3.0171,7.8389,0.0398,2.5625,7.0941,0.0147,5.8259,6.3619,0.1143,3.729,1.8778,1.351,8.5176,4.6193,0.9329,3.3605,4.7468,5.8032,0.0163,1.9969,1.4409,2.1812,2.5188,0.4537,8.7255,0.2735,1.9418,4.404,2.2209,3.5387,0.1477,9.5324,4.6664,5.4062,0.0048,3.002,1.4304,1.6609,2.481,0.162,1.3536,0.7554,2.736,7.7179,0.3619,9.5003,1.1675,2.0612,3.206,0.0233,0.6843,2.3721,0.0029,0.7585,1.4555,0.0005,0.6603,0.98,0.0014,0.7933,2.0262,0.0005,5.615,0.8198,5.0596,0.228,1.6428,5.3239,0.987,3.2991,3.1828,5.9873,0.001,5.6679,0.483,3.1502,2.4001,0.2477,5.9365,0.3129,0.8081,0.0019,4.2594,0.2555,0.8571,1.3047,6.3275,6.2615,4.7973,1.1517,0.3862,0.0016,6.4384,4.4551,1.493,0.8842,0.0002,1.9255,4.2758,3.2803,0.1888,5.8665,3.6362,0.2508,5.0094,5.6537,0.25,3.5293,0.2384,3.4134,3.0018,1.9802,8.4158,1.1485,4.2908,1.7116,2.9254,1.194,3.118,3.1785,2.3319,4.5986,3.5007,0.3958,6.6426,6.1828,0.4043,0.0033,1.4806,1.8861,2.9264,3.5535,0.0016,3.653,5.1823,2.0862,7.8646,4.0138,7.5653,1.677,0.0044,3.4911,1.6016,4.3617,8.0802,5.4474,1.5681,7.4035,3.7285,2.0627,0.1344,0.8446,5.6177,0.6972,3.7102,0.2206,0.5069,6.0784,0.8913,1.9291,0.1659,0.0019,10.4743,3.9507,0.9576,6.7325,3.5685,3.8191,7.4003,1.2965,1.11,0.0002,3.1013,2.3121,0.3048,6.6374,1.5027,4.8405,0.1648,7.106,0.1009,2.8577,1.1968,0.1534,4.6311,4.0927,0.9216,3.9263,1.595,4.3977,0.1107,2.1102,7.4603,2.7542,0.0033,0.9071,2.651,3.8209,0.8421,3.0132,3.9656,1.3543,1.5576,4.326,0.3466,4.3223,6.6983,3.0169,8.0778,1.0949,0.4813,3.0743,0.292,1.7051,0.5454,2.8263,2.1218,0.1741,0.8307,5.6632,2.0087,1.0812,6.498,2.2734,3.7054,6.9545,3.8299,1.0171,4.13,4.1861,4.0065,4.2737,2.8778,0.5374,1.4788,0.6364,6.0663,0.2203,1.6631,6.9103,2.5337,2.9367,3.4737,2.8239,6.1296,3.0369,2.6882,3.463,5.0294,2.8421,2.704,4.1316,0.6005,3.0969,0.5905,5.707,1.4364,2.025,0.0002,0.4392,6.7793,1.259,3.9342,3.0989,0.2785,1.0137,0.0002,2.2579,5.245,3.9573,0.9867,0.9901,6.5864,5.9844,0.1343,2.222,0.2817,3.545,4.084,4.7156,6.5643,0.0101,0.0308,4.5705,3.1364,1.2039,0.6612,0.5145,5.4812,1.6918,4.1352,0.1447,3.0043,0.5499,3.1711,2.1417,4.1426,4.8543,3.1938,0.0413,1.4629,5.6943,5.6211,0.3059,1.1993,0.9512,2.1474,7.461,3.5867,0.2722,4.9281,0.4058,0.0097,0.8163,5.2275,3.5331,2.0398,1.8881,1.4018,0.654,3.8547,1.1221,0.6535,0.0038,2.2896,4.2628,3.2321,0.1529,4.9685,2.8268,5.2344,1.117,1.2895,0.1668,0.4405,5.0386,1.9264,6.2602,0.8588,5.4311,0.4391,1.213,0.1241,3.9485,4.1502,1.9344,2.1402,4.1445,3.7971,2.3567,1.8056,1.3217,0.3449,0.5971,8.7407,0.8949,3.2723,10.6924,4.4325,3.716,1.7661,1.0857,0.892,2.0514]}
{"id":2396,"ended":true,"length":588,"text":"Worlebury Hill is bordered on its north and west sides by steep cliffs dropping down into the Bristol Channel between Weston Bay and Sand Bay. These would have rendered the fort nearly invulnerable to attack from the north, but it is thought that they were a much stronger physical deterrent to attack from the west. It is thought that a small settlement was probably on the hill, perhaps inhabited by an army of local fishermen, but no remains have yet been found; the cliffs may have protected against the tide.[1]\n\nIn the late 18th century the Crown set aside a hill fort and a nearby rock fort and castle along with some of the nearby coastal woodland for the Duke of Richmond. This was so that if the Duke fell out with the Crown he had a strong position and was a more difficult target to dislodge. The first person to try to live at the fort after it was abandoned was the poet Samuel Leigh. In 1818 the site was visited by the Reverend Samuel Wesley, son of the famous Methodist revivalist John Wesley. He described Worlebury Hill as a \"pleasant seat\" and also noted that the cliff was quite precipitous in some places.[2] In 1835 the Marquess of Buckingham and his family took tea here and he later used part of it as a cattle-shed. In 1838 the Duke of Beaufort bought the site and moved to the north-west corner of Sand Bank. Worlebury Hill passed out of use but was later bought by Arthur Maugham, whose daughter lived at the top of the hill until 1914.[2] Later the site fell into dereliction but was restored by the National Trust and reopened in 1990.[3]\n\nIn the early 19th century a number of the coastal cliffs were mined for limestone and the Crown made a serious effort to protect the Bristol Channel Fleet by installing a mine off Sand Bay with some batteries at the entrance to Sand Bay. The mine came close to the cliff at Worlebury, but the defences were less well protected from attack than for the mines at Weston Cove, which were near the cliff. During the First World War, a mine at Old Wharf Hill was accidentally detonated, causing the cliff above which housed four soldiers (including one soldier with a bomb in his arms) to collapse. No-one was killed and the soldiers were lucky to escape injury. The mine was subsequently detonated and the men buried in a cromwellian style trench at the foot of the bluff.[1]\n\nIn the 1930s an archaeological excavation was carried out by the Ministry of Works on the site of the hill fort, led by Sir Cyril Jackson. They discovered some flint tools for cutting stone and several burnt huts. They were unable to find any remains of the hill fort itself, although some trenches close to the mouth of a possible ditch had been dug into the chalk at the top of the bluff. The archaeologists also found a Roman pottery kiln. They were unable to detect any traces of dwellings close to the hill fort and it is possible that the hill fort has been buried under the sand by erosion.","token_len":629,"entropy":[7.0294,5.7898,8.2893,6.7855,3.6726,9.4327,0.0647,1.9242,4.6617,2.0347,2.5017,1.9669,2.7035,0.0315,8.8703,2.7552,9.6147,2.1335,1.8722,0.4524,7.3801,3.4872,5.3829,8.1567,6.42,0.0869,6.6189,9.7824,0.4902,4.9151,6.999,2.7276,6.3442,0.9385,6.8777,4.6695,5.2821,0.2475,0.7152,2.7071,1.853,1.2831,2.7933,1.6325,1.1783,2.3834,2.0886,3.4788,0.7825,2.814,1.36,4.5438,5.2811,3.4947,7.4197,2.9205,1.8778,3.2983,0.517,0.2114,3.3451,0.5929,3.3535,0.7676,2.0673,0.2253,3.5578,3.5415,6.1116,2.8916,4.5921,4.0242,0.4394,4.6881,2.0538,4.3965,7.3398,0.1496,3.2079,3.2053,0.5381,6.3348,4.9883,1.6357,2.2992,2.2123,6.6397,1.6159,4.3066,0.0353,0.352,5.7437,2.2834,6.012,3.8648,0.3156,5.8859,4.4729,1.4345,4.5659,6.6151,2.6736,0.1123,0.4513,0.0026,3.469,1.7607,2.7569,2.5917,0.0554,0.1921,2.1589,8.5972,7.6319,3.4825,2.2311,6.0633,6.0216,3.7153,3.4319,5.0173,5.923,2.1864,3.9012,9.8031,5.1935,2.0363,3.2587,2.0447,0.5108,4.7618,5.9974,8.5316,4.9462,1.316,7.4982,0.2283,6.2494,2.0397,2.3076,1.3685,6.2513,1.4316,5.3108,1.1806,2.6495,5.031,5.428,1.3378,0.8303,4.2727,2.2616,4.7697,2.1851,4.2372,3.2931,3.0497,3.4393,5.022,4.5651,3.9806,1.3688,1.5743,5.1125,0.0004,0.995,1.4602,4.9802,6.4842,0.3629,4.9758,0.5329,8.5256,4.1263,0.748,1.9519,4.6979,2.7122,0.2192,3.3415,0.4487,2.0134,5.9788,4.9076,7.493,1.7305,2.8499,1.1818,4.3042,2.6575,7.1664,0.5115,5.0655,0.3123,1.9779,5.5876,3.5336,7.8477,1.2313,5.456,0.0414,1.45,5.0863,5.9063,8.8541,0.092,2.5893,0.1501,1.013,1.9819,3.9788,12.1909,0.3318,0.0779,0.0545,0.1846,1.7357,0.7043,6.6565,8.0075,2.5031,2.7261,5.6664,2.7812,0.4821,1.4934,5.8075,2.3976,4.8477,5.617,0.0079,3.7296,3.4399,0.3215,2.3241,0.341,0.0362,2.9542,0.6664,4.6563,1.4391,7.9706,0.7342,0.4934,4.6888,3.2694,2.3863,2.6026,3.6611,11.05,5.3708,1.5941,5.1763,4.3692,5.2885,8.7339,0.0107,2.3455,0.7139,0.4031,7.9336,3.1787,4.0119,1.4633,2.3593,0.4645,2.4424,1.1496,2.4336,0.3776,6.6058,0.779,3.5465,1.0044,2.2808,1.2955,3.7922,2.2915,1.4802,3.5887,2.0742,0.8562,2.6047,0.4383,7.6443,6.6818,1.2796,5.1378,0.0908,0.0099,0.1796,7.3978,5.387,0.4323,1.2085,4.9102,1.6943,3.5624,4.0817,0.6665,7.1635,5.7004,4.2702,0.052,1.4625,5.2697,4.635,5.3229,2.1822,0.3947,4.5851,0.3909,0.3207,0.1489,4.8734,6.5608,1.6458,3.1458,0.0509,5.6781,1.7741,2.4387,5.7397,1.0375,8.376,0.2563,4.7127,2.4694,3.1553,1.708,0.9778,5.1792,0.6104,2.9906,6.7427,0.8597,4.9845,1.4685,0.2831,0.0523,0.3886,0.0001,2.4712,1.6359,1.6139,2.4133,0.0018,0.022,2.1195,4.5136,0.0027,5.1341,5.827,2.8293,1.2631,7.5537,3.1274,4.6601,1.645,2.7792,6.3579,5.0313,1.3564,6.6398,0.923,0.0618,2.9622,1.0951,9.6071,3.0217,10.3509,3.6502,4.4821,1.5851,5.2524,6.4204,4.3968,1.0239,5.1465,4.2063,10.7071,3.2943,1.3939,4.1617,1.3002,4.5919,0.5196,0.662,1.3445,2.6754,5.2437,4.5233,0.3743,3.3364,5.2519,3.2199,6.9898,0.0727,0.0078,3.0828,0.8745,1.7019,5.8314,0.6278,6.0083,4.5675,1.4126,4.4277,2.2473,2.6124,6.5733,1.348,6.8114,1.5729,4.9235,7.9573,1.965,1.8402,1.1955,5.3416,0.64,1.9862,1.131,4.5465,0.3616,5.2895,0.0498,0.001,2.4009,2.7867,3.6468,1.9297,8.0354,5.365,1.4172,6.8252,0.7798,5.4793,2.0752,2.568,2.4063,1.496,3.7023,5.6894,5.4456,11.3526,8.1513,5.1548,5.603,3.0529,1.6234,4.0192,3.4505,1.0525,5.9788,2.9723,0.3524,7.5879,0.4766,0.1038,3.4116,0.9904,5.301,4.1292,0.0145,0.6615,1.3764,1.7129,0.9182,5.2307,0.8713,5.831,0.3557,1.4722,7.2547,0.7513,1.5729,2.7154,0.9545,3.8304,5.3178,1.599,1.2599,4.9627,5.2412,1.57,1.8269,4.7311,11.8898,0.7904,10.5075,6.5815,4.4189,3.3476,1.4106,4.0331,0.0098,0.4845,5.7203,2.294,3.2077,0.0449,0.4328,0.0001,2.0071,1.2936,3.1105,0.0166,3.9991,4.4355,2.2645,2.1811,1.6409,0.0371,1.7198,0.873,5.976,0.0569,5.2437,3.7004,1.1195,1.6934,0.952,1.2621,4.6954,0.4186,2.1518,5.9694,0.0149,2.577,7.6592,0.1466,7.0672,1.113,4.9861,2.3127,3.5084,7.5951,0.3,4.5195,5.1048,3.3524,3.1525,1.3033,5.7468,7.3621,5.5501,0.2905,1.4627,2.4523,2.8729,6.6857,0.0094,1.5966,0.6978,3.1789,0.665,1.0153,3.4178,0.1972,3.4356,1.2189,2.4961,2.2527,7.3834,7.7644,0.3349,0.5148,6.9423,0.3393,5.0024,8.2446,4.077,2.1967,0.1311,0.8977,4.5746,1.2137,9.4479,3.8216,0.6252,2.9533,0.7029,0.1893,3.3813,0.7688,1.4899,4.4971,2.1581,0.6473,1.5376,6.5657,4.5786,0.0229,4.9065,0.0571,2.6596,2.2867,2.5815,1.4976,0.0082,6.1379,0.5956,1.573,0.0162,9.4166,6.9096,0.1634,0.1099,2.0188,0.5511,2.5522,3.3372,1.0432,3.5715,0.1568,1.1462,3.2055,0.0779,4.7484,0.4521,3.9202,2.4338,2.1383,3.8581,4.1355,4.7503,1.1547]}
{"id":4451,"ended":true,"length":594,"text":"A remake of Metal Gear Solid, titled Metal Gear Solid : The Twin Snakes, was developed by Silicon Knights under the supervision of Hideo Kojima and released for the GameCube in North America in 2001, and in Europe and Australia in 2002. This remake includes improved gameplay and graphics, as well as English dubs of the majority of vocal dialogue.[5] The game's Japanese version, released in 1997, featured a different plot.[6]\n\nMetal Gear Solid : The Twin Snakes has achieved a significant cult following, mainly due to the game's increased content, as well as its unique presentation, and use of HD visuals for 3D action\/adventure gaming. The game also received positive reception due to the improved controls, the use of 3D graphics for a non-3D game, and as one of the first games to make use of the Wii Remote as a gamepad. Most critics praised the game's improved graphics, sound quality, and overall experience.[7][8][9]\n\nAlthough most reviews were positive, the game received some criticism from some critics. Several reviews noted that the game was not as challenging as its predecessor, and thus it had lost its \"thriller and suspense element\". Most reviewers also noted that the increased graphics have caused the game to run worse than the original. A few reviews noted that the game was hard to get used to the control scheme, as well as the overall presentation, although almost all reviews praised the 3D graphics being used for such a non-3D game. Finally, several reviewers commented on the game's difficulty, and specifically its lack of challenge.\n\nMetal Gear Solid was originally released in a limited Collector's Edition by Solid State Entertainment in 1997 exclusively for the PlayStation. The Collector's Edition includes a 64-page hardcover art book, two music CDs, a poster, two CDs with game content including the unreleased track \"Black Mamba Escape\" by the group \"Xenophone\", and the original game discs with all of the content for the game included.\n\nIn a 2001 interview with Entertainment Weekly,[10] Kojima stated that he has no plans on revisiting the original Metal Gear Solid, mainly as it would be impossible to replicate the story. A sequel, titled Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance, would be released in 2000 and would be the last Metal Gear Solid game released for the PlayStation.[11] However, Kojima has confirmed the original game, along with Metal Gear Solid 2, Substance, and the remastered Twin Snakes version of the first game, in a \"Collection\" will eventually be released.[12][13][14]\n\nMetal Gear Solid : The Twin Snakes was the first entry in the franchise that was made available on the PlayStation Network, making it the first Metal Gear Solid game ever released on the PC,[15] and also the first Metal Gear Solid game ever released on a portable console.[16]\n\nIn 2007, an unofficial port of the original Metal Gear Solid was released on the Wii. Metal Gear Solid has also been ported to iOS in 2012.","token_len":629,"entropy":[12.1927,0.4811,7.6423,0.1166,0.1862,3.0115,6.3577,0.7028,0.0228,0.2531,9.0308,1.9003,4.3688,1.9656,0.0212,1.1142,1.5816,3.8629,0.3548,8.1989,2.6129,5.1879,0.2464,2.7307,0.0099,5.3492,0.0428,0.0115,0.0,0.0,1.9988,4.1969,2.126,0.9613,4.6015,1.3026,0.6315,3.8431,0.0175,1.3269,3.416,2.6713,1.7046,2.4576,0.5503,1.9446,2.3556,0.2537,1.3231,0.2986,4.1265,2.5744,5.1217,6.7419,3.8731,1.4472,3.8521,0.7334,2.374,0.0129,0.0038,7.8654,4.1399,1.6181,3.155,1.0573,8.5932,0.011,10.8107,4.9754,4.2608,3.2566,0.1468,1.9837,1.4569,2.0144,2.9586,2.5614,2.6614,3.4194,0.5928,4.7485,0.3969,3.0207,1.5817,3.9729,4.5043,4.626,0.3058,0.0956,0.8622,0.0003,2.2366,0.0018,0.0692,3.6374,0.8,0.3305,0.0058,0.001,3.8574,6.6974,1.94,4.6818,3.8166,0.0571,2.0582,5.4853,0.7868,0.0052,1.2655,3.6016,0.0966,6.6802,6.0999,1.4531,3.0271,0.1189,0.0123,1.516,3.8696,4.6176,1.8597,2.4871,7.6977,0.0392,6.0131,3.751,3.5326,6.6675,0.1107,4.3399,6.0198,0.8343,0.0167,5.4788,0.5896,1.6845,0.8184,2.7519,2.084,4.2447,4.2065,3.7006,0.0103,1.3039,6.693,5.5865,1.0731,3.0835,3.213,0.0021,3.2734,0.1099,2.8274,2.448,4.6319,6.3033,0.1238,5.9151,0.1254,3.0777,0.9499,0.2921,6.6634,4.9681,0.0311,0.1468,1.5885,1.6935,0.6933,5.0289,0.4664,0.0013,1.6424,3.8199,3.0169,4.5528,0.449,4.0584,2.1049,0.9932,5.8329,3.4398,2.0139,0.3615,0.6553,1.0604,5.1174,1.5109,0.847,4.7704,3.8339,0.1382,0.1958,3.2613,3.3216,2.4284,0.1813,2.2977,0.0432,1.5448,0.0248,0.2428,0.9169,0.0002,5.1909,4.0806,4.1205,2.6483,1.4658,0.6471,2.6226,0.9884,2.0726,2.6983,0.6339,1.5935,2.6188,1.2886,2.5407,4.6559,4.225,3.5133,0.5741,0.5924,0.7901,1.7091,2.4575,1.7336,4.0185,0.3241,1.9375,0.9048,0.5741,1.2022,5.332,3.4015,3.3704,6.9893,1.3701,4.0658,6.6617,2.003,0.4893,4.8169,5.1229,6.6389,1.9671,5.226,2.3513,1.6913,1.7862,0.3783,0.5842,7.4762,3.6691,4.7581,3.0146,1.1592,0.4335,0.1702,4.4893,5.9402,1.1091,1.6127,0.5975,1.5721,3.3788,1.9528,4.135,2.34,0.2714,0.5124,0.8966,2.1557,5.7831,0.1571,3.7318,3.0786,0.0055,6.8576,6.6202,0.6698,0.8446,3.0037,2.6386,0.016,1.1651,6.3172,4.3267,1.3912,4.602,7.5884,0.2845,3.5064,2.7109,0.1972,5.7987,0.0357,1.1927,7.7688,1.75,1.6529,4.4149,0.7896,5.2678,0.0095,0.2901,0.0027,0.3153,0.9543,5.5782,0.0361,2.4325,1.0278,3.2691,1.6026,0.2437,1.6943,0.0897,2.4003,1.0926,2.5611,5.1064,2.5201,2.8579,0.003,5.0827,1.317,1.3742,0.0002,2.3314,0.0007,0.0136,4.7344,3.1719,1.1552,1.3683,4.7543,3.1036,8.0112,0.0227,0.093,5.5461,5.9752,7.0356,1.6651,1.234,3.2152,9.6114,0.1143,0.2569,2.1837,2.525,1.3805,3.9568,0.0335,0.0449,3.2375,1.5173,6.2419,0.5895,2.3305,3.5794,0.3827,4.5547,0.3366,0.9266,3.995,5.9119,0.5659,0.2677,1.3188,4.3528,0.7017,2.8351,4.9769,1.4399,4.2256,4.2353,5.2114,1.6085,8.5586,0.0019,6.8547,0.3824,5.3287,5.3782,0.4688,8.4164,2.3152,2.1076,2.9284,4.5722,3.2243,5.0991,2.421,7.3867,0.557,0.8629,2.5502,3.019,3.354,5.7713,3.353,3.1757,1.9984,0.229,3.1032,3.8224,0.7561,1.1974,3.2264,1.0626,1.9879,0.0002,2.4347,4.0873,5.3358,0.5484,0.5938,4.6934,0.0292,4.0943,0.1149,0.0818,0.614,0.0024,0.0005,1.2848,0.3714,2.2214,4.1502,2.4979,0.4612,4.1232,4.7922,0.0009,0.798,1.6329,0.4457,0.001,0.1739,1.74,8.6642,3.6713,1.9532,3.1691,1.5534,4.1359,0.4039,5.3463,0.5725,4.045,3.6353,4.5596,2.8461,1.5857,4.1247,0.1695,0.0129,0.1627,2.1013,0.1252,7.974,0.7459,2.6254,1.294,0.5578,0.8361,3.4212,2.5275,1.5839,1.913,2.5971,2.7647,1.4111,0.0021,0.2847,0.3022,1.8376,1.9308,0.3454,1.4925,2.194,0.1082,0.154,3.7727,0.026,1.9386,0.0021,0.001,1.9764,4.6017,3.5113,3.2838,1.3817,4.1756,4.2359,0.001,2.431,0.0051,0.0771,1.5704,1.5995,12.039,0.7037,0.2234,1.6789,5.5067,0.6616,8.4486,0.0379,0.0028,4.9302,1.413,1.3659,5.7058,0.5691,0.9106,3.129,2.0392,5.7345,10.1234,2.1671,8.179,6.8396,0.3231,0.2655,2.5357,0.1026,2.0678,0.032,1.5436,0.0149,0.3953,0.482,0.0002,1.7806,0.004,0.0296,3.6532,0.4709,0.1893,0.0019,0.0018,1.5419,2.6922,0.8864,4.1236,0.1912,0.3457,4.7133,3.3991,1.5404,3.4083,2.3994,1.8471,0.7844,1.059,2.7972,2.1378,4.5843,0.3632,0.3544,0.3771,2.4534,0.0015,0.3835,0.1871,3.8781,1.4172,1.1919,0.5232,4.283,5.1295,0.1191,0.2366,0.8543,3.0907,0.6478,0.2793,1.3929,0.0036,0.1485,0.2575,2.726,1.1818,0.4631,2.8178,3.4349,1.3979,0.9399,0.061,0.2984,1.327,0.0002,2.9186,3.7429,0.179,5.1051,4.5815,6.7767,0.3966,1.2474,1.3043,1.0262,0.0018,0.0352,1.7081,0.6196,1.6733,0.5573,2.1562,3.036,5.3703,0.0061,0.0422,6.2153,2.4835,0.506,1.1788,0.3441,5.3118,4.2238,3.7044,1.3148]}
{"id":1627,"ended":true,"length":563,"text":"Old Pine Church is a large, one @ - @ story, gablefront log building. Its symmetrical front fa\u00e7ade faces west and encompasses a main entrance consisting of a double set of four windows on center on the facade. Original door hardware, window sills, and hand rail, are still visible on the interior of the building.\n\nThere are two entrances, the east end of the building accessed from the corner of North 5th and East 4th streets, and the northwest corner.\n\nIn addition, one of the east doors (entrance 3) leads through into a former living room on the second floor. There are 3 windows along the north side of the building.\n\nThe northwest door (entrance 1) leads upstairs to the second floor and through the center of the building. There are two windows along the front of the building at the west end (north end) of the second floor.\n\nThe first floor contains a meeting area and vestry. A staircase is located at the northwest end of the vestry where access was once provided to the second floor. The second floor houses an office that was used for storage and a small bathroom area.\n\nAdjacent to the church, but detached, is a small building used by the church as a store and as a meeting place.\n\nHistorical significance:\n\nBuilt in 1927 as a meeting place for the community of Old Pine Hill where they could meet at Old Pine Church.\n\nThe building and its contents are valuable to the community and it is significant because it is an important reminder of the history and culture of the community.\n\nReasons that Old Pine Church qualifies for a listing on the National Register:\n\nThe church is a historically important example of a mid-20th century log building that exemplifies the local styles of that time period.\n\nHistoric places are often the most intact reminders of a community's history. In Old Pine Church, the building, its contents and furnishings give us an opportunity to see the life of this small rural community in 1928.\n\nReasons Old Pine Church should be listed in its entirety as a contributing local property of a historic district.\n\nThe building, its contents, and the furnishings contribute to the historic character of the church district.\n\nA contributing local property within a historic district, within the district, is important from an architectural standpoint. The church is a representative example of the local architecture, including the design and materials used, which characterize an area.\n\nOld Pine Church is an excellent example of the simple square shape which was popular in rural areas during this time period.\n\nIt is one of few such buildings in the county. Its use as a church is still unusual.\n\nThe architectural craftsmanship is exceptional for the local building style; it is extremely well-preserved and still representative of a working building used today as an annual school meeting place.\n\nThe property combines several different types of historic architectural significance into one complex.\n\nOld Pine School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.","token_len":629,"entropy":[11.4297,7.2799,3.7226,1.7923,4.4377,1.6914,6.5076,16.8549,8.2149,6.2254,9.904,4.0693,6.9787,7.3157,10.3297,10.9913,5.2658,2.1288,4.5225,11.4188,0.0636,4.6861,6.1704,0.0084,0.0119,7.9982,3.2856,1.732,10.1211,1.9344,5.3818,3.1854,8.524,0.0557,0.8203,5.0287,6.6411,0.1092,4.4711,4.14,3.3634,8.5624,5.4618,1.2151,5.9859,0.7167,7.8576,7.4039,8.0714,2.8108,6.1837,6.2776,0.1553,0.5316,1.3908,6.4496,7.0704,5.2117,3.6953,4.397,4.4173,1.8092,0.3646,3.7587,1.6808,0.2216,0.3672,0.3528,2.2661,0.029,4.966,0.6703,1.8569,3.4233,3.0045,2.8206,4.7162,4.2222,1.0595,0.7319,0.6803,8.7672,2.0063,0.5724,6.2921,0.33,4.9446,5.7378,0.0413,1.5831,3.7124,3.0703,0.0024,1.1668,1.5149,0.7231,0.4733,5.203,2.7681,3.6205,1.882,0.0003,4.0342,1.7973,1.3965,4.8573,0.9452,0.1414,5.4375,2.5065,3.5424,7.5822,0.1535,4.5381,0.8234,3.0928,3.9782,5.4856,1.6874,5.6108,7.1107,0.3106,2.8756,0.687,2.5901,0.1572,1.3066,3.4232,0.9562,5.5892,3.9058,4.1573,0.4538,2.9977,1.0259,0.2681,0.1569,0.8288,1.5369,0.9617,0.0002,1.5562,5.7113,2.4154,2.1023,1.2092,0.0012,2.1254,0.0351,0.4964,6.1072,1.3511,1.1247,2.7615,0.3125,2.5456,3.8054,1.7514,6.1152,0.7263,0.1658,0.8433,0.8861,1.185,0.3327,2.1049,1.5004,1.3557,0.1069,4.5137,1.875,0.0768,0.1749,5.0265,0.3209,3.5109,0.2597,3.9883,5.3704,2.3487,1.8579,2.2058,0.1153,5.7774,0.1348,0.677,0.7547,0.0002,1.2067,4.8073,1.1219,4.1286,0.8689,6.5673,3.0509,1.9973,9.9357,5.1145,1.6799,3.2239,5.9143,2.9143,1.6549,2.1224,0.1347,3.0593,1.0848,0.4086,0.0642,7.0921,0.0093,5.7113,4.688,5.4137,4.9803,2.8051,1.7524,0.6204,3.4823,0.1031,0.5031,1.9113,1.9476,0.084,5.1078,2.6399,2.928,4.3781,1.7362,2.2428,1.4451,4.7593,2.0152,2.6928,3.8087,4.1364,4.4261,0.686,0.7451,0.0002,7.0055,2.9442,0.0125,0.2057,0.1991,6.7605,1.6281,8.316,9.3147,2.4721,0.7546,0.7567,2.363,4.7116,5.6967,2.1905,1.2566,2.201,1.9094,0.3829,4.7948,2.2977,3.1082,0.3311,3.5653,0.8228,0.4632,1.4658,0.0002,7.0773,1.7786,4.8649,1.8842,0.8741,0.0003,4.5171,0.7418,5.673,2.5612,0.8143,3.8974,0.5191,0.8135,1.4257,5.185,1.3475,5.4551,0.0173,7.365,6.2188,4.7799,3.9833,1.5602,3.4528,7.2136,0.0171,0.7616,1.5658,1.0777,0.0002,2.132,1.8686,4.8252,1.4054,3.4738,1.1776,7.0106,1.1566,0.5959,0.8311,1.3636,3.5756,0.8765,5.7601,3.4175,1.0719,1.4905,3.3436,1.4098,5.6046,0.641,0.7021,2.5653,2.0595,3.5282,0.2013,1.0598,2.0444,0.6528,0.5616,0.0002,6.243,2.4184,4.337,2.0444,0.0003,1.4612,9.1218,1.6704,2.614,4.1695,3.3067,0.7367,1.6411,0.1005,3.4044,0.1743,0.0002,1.8877,2.295,1.4137,1.9976,4.716,1.4471,6.6661,0.2337,1.9551,7.4927,0.378,2.5915,0.0075,0.1629,10.1405,0.7671,2.0416,6.2128,0.6051,0.708,5.371,7.6967,0.6176,6.8235,0.5699,1.7226,0.4221,0.9088,0.0001,4.854,1.4977,7.5956,3.619,3.1598,4.479,2.7376,9.1827,7.9002,0.2113,2.8756,1.3003,1.6875,1.0697,1.0616,4.9539,2.2603,0.0003,1.1409,0.6448,1.6739,2.7908,4.0709,2.8434,1.8976,1.1098,6.8219,0.0018,6.7545,2.7762,1.6918,2.2516,0.0544,2.303,1.3194,4.2198,0.6514,3.376,4.204,6.1742,0.3975,2.9417,11.434,0.6317,0.4724,0.0002,5.228,0.0428,6.0208,0.0001,0.0727,3.7176,0.7082,1.1747,3.4511,5.4003,2.3176,4.4904,1.2597,7.6297,6.8677,4.2188,5.2498,4.0864,3.2569,6.3259,3.0025,0.3494,0.0002,1.6812,1.5012,3.3107,0.776,0.257,1.8819,0.8734,5.3731,1.4073,0.0004,5.3889,0.2164,0.8241,3.8013,2.0179,0.1863,0.8117,2.8758,7.3453,0.574,0.2422,0.0002,3.8798,6.0644,1.9708,1.0648,6.7845,1.4089,2.494,0.0774,3.0044,6.8276,1.1463,4.6623,1.7969,1.9865,3.922,6.6734,1.8596,1.6031,1.6253,0.6961,2.9864,3.0129,1.7028,1.3774,5.5428,1.2155,0.1231,2.1034,2.5637,3.879,2.6405,4.2876,1.0707,5.1762,1.6493,4.0323,0.9149,3.5172,3.2512,7.7342,5.4717,1.2799,1.2631,0.4786,0.0002,3.53,0.0003,0.2359,1.2492,2.523,4.2157,0.3837,0.0417,1.6408,7.8522,8.7161,4.4769,5.0644,3.4957,4.4772,1.537,3.7645,2.129,2.6852,2.2872,0.6456,0.9334,0.2686,0.8313,0.0002,3.8231,0.6875,4.3399,0.0609,4.9346,6.0205,2.2093,1.136,0.5516,3.3894,2.187,4.514,5.3029,1.8229,0.3237,5.466,3.1698,4.4629,6.5824,1.6049,0.5955,0.0002,1.9017,6.2741,7.6808,0.0489,3.0021,3.8926,3.543,2.0211,5.0827,5.4912,3.684,5.669,1.9096,0.7818,5.1248,2.5419,2.0719,3.1111,0.0033,0.9938,5.6835,7.6243,0.0877,2.4417,6.1248,3.9088,7.746,4.0672,4.2274,2.4476,5.8378,6.8753,4.4175,0.4718,0.3173,0.2927,0.0002,1.3049,5.4447,7.5577,4.2507,4.2104,2.5501,0.0299,2.6874,5.1214,8.555,4.5808,0.3431,5.3833,1.2345,0.8865,0.0002,3.1975,0.0003,8.3279,4.5122,7.4185,1.8625,0.1345,0.4214,0.0023,0.9708,0.0019,0.0036,0.61,5.4959,0.9666]}

The program also hosts a variety of student and community events such as lecture series, service learning, and environmental workshops in order to build community support.","token_len":629,"entropy":[9.805,0.7229,7.0387,2.9178,1.0832,7.6948,5.8738,5.3095,0.0242,11.7816,4.2442,0.0005,2.6499,3.2147,2.0898,6.1504,0.3056,5.4355,2.1949,1.0906,2.0804,3.7888,7.1912,1.5188,1.7105,3.6116,4.1117,4.4525,1.229,3.2905,2.0006,7.6391,0.1109,7.4458,0.6303,1.786,3.6116,6.5411,0.0461,6.6727,5.5552,2.7122,1.4443,5.0763,0.6545,1.91,5.3229,2.419,1.0069,3.8278,0.784,0.4124,1.2497,0.0004,2.8395,1.442,0.7322,0.8578,0.6986,5.5522,5.3439,3.8678,0.9956,0.8426,7.2414,1.1162,2.1206,4.237,6.6328,2.847,2.6198,6.5963,0.1901,0.0959,1.184,1.6306,3.7127,0.8155,0.4094,1.9874,0.0079,0.0238,0.0042,2.7376,0.0949,0.3891,2.0491,1.2141,5.3652,0.4197,2.0162,1.4259,7.1303,0.2576,0.452,0.8408,0.0002,1.9683,5.9624,0.1986,6.6054,3.7754,0.2141,0.236,0.0014,3.7485,3.5539,2.2835,0.0016,0.8637,6.3194,0.6841,0.3591,0.6008,0.1612,3.651,1.1372,3.3964,12.5387,5.4986,5.4368,6.1272,2.2977,1.3497,2.5662,3.1806,3.8857,4.8408,2.8626,2.4915,2.2976,6.2125,2.9849,0.6029,0.7132,0.0002,2.7335,0.213,0.0276,1.4571,1.3609,5.2967,5.2241,2.6954,0.852,0.0868,0.0008,0.3522,1.2035,1.6875,4.6754,0.0388,5.7765,2.0248,0.8259,0.0002,2.9699,2.1424,0.5373,0.3333,0.0005,5.2575,0.0114,4.3661,1.2066,4.4109,6.3182,0.2739,0.0803,6.9812,4.3073,1.8308,2.1563,6.4163,1.5435,6.0957,5.681,1.2599,4.1196,6.593,1.3086,5.636,3.1706,6.1659,5.7232,4.7887,0.6664,2.9783,5.8276,2.022,1.6995,2.0869,3.0317,3.6615,1.1261,3.9131,1.6487,2.536,1.2928,6.9182,0.0232,2.9121,0.4195,2.277,3.5091,4.3467,2.4038,0.8817,0.6181,0.0001,3.6324,2.1647,4.581,3.9716,1.6113,0.1295,7.0043,9.2728,8.6571,5.3866,4.8808,1.5427,4.7038,2.3289,0.0408,2.7036,3.0525,3.6088,0.193,2.7873,5.1976,0.1631,9.9558,2.2154,5.4045,4.7224,1.3008,2.0535,1.4095,2.245,5.5392,0.1232,5.5377,6.2187,2.5635,2.5446,9.7392,1.5578,3.6955,4.4471,0.4458,0.8136,5.9813,0.0011,1.7984,0.0128,7.6917,3.6543,2.7243,1.6899,7.1728,3.1503,1.7628,4.1654,2.2034,1.8914,2.9151,0.0014,1.3652,3.1092,6.1004,1.5839,2.0749,1.5803,4.3681,2.7702,0.11,0.0623,5.1265,3.6174,2.4241,0.2123,0.0925,3.8942,2.7565,4.8728,0.9844,0.3837,0.0009,3.9082,1.9531,3.5107,1.7715,2.0801,1.1025,4.766,0.4066,7.3978,2.8615,6.2947,4.7613,5.8693,3.2661,2.3663,4.1365,0.1155,3.4714,2.2281,4.7995,0.6759,4.9738,2.9866,1.8284,2.497,1.7513,2.8392,4.984,0.3145,0.3811,0.0001,2.1976,0.1725,0.0166,1.93,1.0749,4.2877,0.0684,0.3431,0.0033,2.5639,5.367,4.3986,0.8701,0.1893,0.2932,0.5355,3.9437,0.0261,1.3593,0.4647,0.6553,0.0001,2.0132,3.6427,0.0206,3.0799,2.0381,2.0953,1.8794,0.2769,0.017,5.7485,0.7851,2.1741,0.318,2.1711,4.6306,0.4809,0.4255,3.9889,3.3216,0.3458,2.2055,0.0743,2.1699,3.1438,2.9102,0.2441,0.8875,0.2579,0.4397,1.9587,3.7217,0.8371,0.0013,2.2865,0.7203,4.7809,1.6806,3.7102,0.8692,0.6922,2.7201,0.8127,1.0732,3.6913,3.5228,4.0504,1.6553,4.8146,0.0428,1.2257,0.259,1.7233,4.3795,0.204,0.7388,1.3177,0.3126,3.6721,0.7761,1.4906,3.169,0.97,3.8745,0.5053,1.1137,0.0001,3.4251,1.5404,0.3422,1.4802,3.7303,1.119,3.9822,1.9721,0.3598,4.4304,0.5749,0.591,0.4532,0.3508,0.4807,0.0446,1.4221,2.0148,0.1647,0.7243,4.4916,1.4103,5.8501,0.6989,0.8625,3.8265,4.2689,3.8543,3.1013,3.0185,0.8542,1.3273,0.0001,8.0977,0.1354,4.5987,0.0068,2.9088,0.0773,1.631,1.1178,1.933,0.8059,0.3221,0.6625,2.8476,3.1011,1.7766,1.0337,1.3775,0.6783,1.769,0.0002,1.7852,0.2173,0.0185,0.7702,0.5204,1.6791,0.0204,0.1341,0.0103,2.3262,2.4826,1.1585,0.3159,0.0877,6.8348,0.1645,0.5174,6.4005,3.1777,0.002,0.7163,0.2147,0.445,0.0001,1.8063,4.87,0.998,1.4285,0.9319,0.9367,0.0796,0.0083,5.9733,1.9159,6.2771,0.006,0.1875,3.6497,0.069,2.7568,3.1149,0.5222,3.1343,0.4524,0.8993,5.1678,0.0064,4.8131,5.0006,1.8035,1.8726,3.5965,1.3908,3.5597,4.4321,4.4557,2.173,4.6259,6.7072,2.0091,2.0417,1.7097,5.9825,0.8312,6.9777,1.1649,1.6391,2.6327,0.0281,0.0668,0.5399,2.4694,0.0346,0.1702,0.5196,2.2773,2.2858,4.489,3.6067,7.104,5.1593,0.1232,3.7414,3.0277,1.1023,3.5831,8.823,1.6174,1.5643,5.1089,0.9176,3.1174,1.5118,0.2274,0.612,0.0001,6.5249,0.0593,1.4599,5.8336,2.047,4.9282,3.7513,0.3454,1.5239,2.9132,2.2415,0.0277,5.7891,6.3913,4.842,4.2452,3.7462,4.1758,2.4629,6.6634,0.387,1.3113,3.9843,0.0701,0.3284,2.433,4.8988,4.6971,4.1662,2.5879,1.8968,5.0191,0.9717,0.6573,0.3281,0.4595,1.8986,2.3703,7.7872,3.2105,4.5046,0.3831,1.4193,2.4309,2.0057,4.0177,1.3775,3.5156,0.0015,3.6594,2.7111,3.5071,1.8984,4.077,0.0006,7.0459,1.4793,0.5588,8.6003,3.8409,1.2363,0.8816,3.5308,4.6024,4.7482,4.2987,0.0017,4.6204,2.2119,2.3454,1.6691]}
{"id":237,"ended":true,"length":518,"text":"Corn crakes are the subject of three stanzas of the seventeenth century poet Andrew Marvell's `` Upon Appleton House ``, written in 1651 about the North Yorkshire country estate of Thomas Fairfax. The birds are, in the Marvellian language, `` a kind of cockle, or shell fish, `` and, while they `` feed on an ooze out of the ground `` their `` heads smell like a sweet apple-dumpling.'' The authors of the poem also liken the creatures to a ``salty, pinnatifid shrimp. `` Corn crakes and crickets are also described as ``peculiar things, `` which `` we scarce can tell from one another `` in Robert Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy ( printed in the edition of 1620). The corn crane is also alluded to in one of the sixteenth century poems attributed to John Donne, `` a sort of grasshopper, or green-backer, or chironomid-fiddler, in form`` : ``But there may be a strange creature in the woody ground. ``\n\nCorn cranes are known from fossil remains, or crania, of the Middle Jurassic and Triassic in the United States and Europe, but there have been few reports of the surviving species from the fossil record, particularly in recent decades.\n\nThe early record of this type of crane is from the first half of the eighteenth century. J.F. Brown ( 1727 ) reported that he had observed four specimens of corn cranes, but also wrote of the difficulty in establishing their identity. J.A. Gould ( 1832-3 ) had a field season in Indiana in 1827 that produced a dozen specimens, and recorded the cranes'' diets and song. C.R. Dabney also noticed corn cranes in Indiana in the early to mid-1830s, as did the American naturalist J.A. Gould ( 1834-5 ) and the biologist F.H. Schomburgk ( 1837-6 ). J.P. Stearns ( 1857-8 ) and H.F.C. Van Horn ( 1864-5 ) noted them in South Dakota during the 1880s, and the latter observed two individuals feeding at a water hole in an old railroad valley. The last reported observation of an extant corn crane was by J.E. Jones ( 1894 ) in Colorado, but recent records show they survived there into the 1950s.\n\nNo specimens of the birds are now known in the United States, but it appears that they are occasionally brought to the country. A male specimen from Illinois and several from Oklahoma apparently originated in Russia. A specimen that was apparently confiscated from the British consulate in Los Angeles in 1952 was described and illustrated by J.W. Smith ( 1957-8 ). He noted that the birds'' song was very faint, although `` the call and call of other cranes is loud and distinct.'' J.C. Smith ( 1977-8 ) reports having seen three individuals in Arkansas in 1979.","token_len":629,"entropy":[12.5855,6.6716,2.5262,3.5941,6.4812,0.0271,5.7292,9.011,2.9345,0.0009,3.4078,1.3265,8.5378,0.0435,0.32,7.5914,7.8046,5.87,4.4897,2.5145,11.0368,14.3647,9.6609,4.6491,6.3762,3.8997,2.6636,3.9675,0.9221,2.873,5.052,5.4004,1.5645,7.7488,5.147,5.7722,4.8887,1.0802,4.3674,7.9482,1.1191,1.5719,10.1695,1.4704,5.6839,1.8786,2.2397,9.9949,0.056,2.3832,3.4239,0.0858,3.7392,5.0788,3.5979,0.185,6.3287,3.5801,1.6872,2.5076,6.882,6.2823,0.7352,6.6187,0.8583,3.3611,4.867,2.2501,8.3003,5.6622,0.966,5.2152,4.5638,3.7516,0.0406,8.1425,0.256,0.9016,2.0885,5.4952,4.7061,7.8469,5.6112,8.2299,1.6902,2.405,4.8746,4.4228,5.7284,5.0482,3.6678,0.226,1.7589,1.8529,5.3439,1.4157,0.5072,2.7429,2.9384,7.8337,0.0118,0.9404,5.4604,0.1237,2.5395,4.619,4.7956,5.7053,2.9329,4.8263,7.5021,4.2699,5.8866,4.229,6.2145,4.9438,2.5832,8.6359,1.833,0.0294,4.1564,6.4265,0.726,1.0374,3.917,3.6553,1.2827,3.9422,6.3659,3.7867,0.0143,5.3456,1.8586,3.8701,2.9392,5.8193,5.3086,9.4619,3.6499,3.5775,1.7167,5.9654,4.021,5.102,4.2154,9.0803,5.8268,0.162,3.6068,6.7632,0.0216,0.0413,8.6389,0.5738,0.3691,2.8251,11.6244,0.6552,3.5801,5.9063,0.4086,4.5426,4.9009,1.084,1.987,6.8962,10.6996,1.2913,2.6655,5.824,0.0197,0.6382,4.4283,0.3685,0.767,5.352,3.581,1.7281,2.0242,4.1712,0.0527,3.7302,6.204,0.4223,1.0229,3.919,4.4105,3.967,0.0181,8.0786,0.7641,0.0063,1.2595,1.1033,5.47,1.7412,11.819,0.8053,2.1724,5.4821,7.3179,8.7402,2.7864,4.9671,4.5571,5.6578,0.7816,4.0558,6.2742,6.5869,7.0261,1.4479,9.0077,4.0762,4.3839,0.3412,1.9845,5.2268,3.8885,1.442,0.935,4.8703,4.7711,4.4363,3.3661,3.7719,4.1865,0.371,4.1427,5.6592,6.7984,1.0087,4.178,2.1136,8.3052,3.6113,1.9762,5.243,7.4879,3.4417,0.8655,2.455,1.3723,4.3998,4.5135,2.7834,6.3189,0.0,5.4469,1.7558,2.3093,0.0715,1.6587,2.5275,1.0702,2.8943,3.508,3.1405,0.3431,2.7316,2.3114,0.2904,2.8268,7.4552,2.6896,3.6888,1.4286,5.1784,0.9647,2.178,4.5261,1.4651,4.6327,2.0961,0.2553,3.5305,0.0004,1.8859,5.2829,5.4306,0.6921,4.815,4.0189,0.4748,4.6686,1.3831,2.7041,1.1494,4.4407,2.9213,0.0103,0.0156,1.909,0.0115,1.5483,7.2823,0.248,5.0361,0.0254,5.6599,2.8005,4.627,5.1592,1.8418,3.0746,1.2604,3.9611,1.4254,3.2196,4.1582,2.0859,0.6945,2.2932,0.5295,0.0276,2.7437,3.3583,5.2679,5.4507,1.9368,2.1824,8.1638,1.7669,4.5548,1.9394,3.9526,1.2343,4.5735,0.0455,3.9436,0.0223,7.0862,0.7425,1.0004,4.5965,5.5544,3.8756,0.382,4.4305,3.2239,6.1709,7.7071,1.737,7.2112,2.1034,0.9384,4.2471,4.4816,4.143,2.0248,4.5612,1.2358,1.6522,1.6489,5.9693,2.2516,4.1611,0.0719,7.5897,8.9624,3.318,8.2447,2.9314,5.0465,0.1281,3.6502,0.0179,5.0356,5.8687,0.5154,5.5259,5.3923,3.2849,0.2631,0.008,1.2671,3.3866,1.3594,3.0005,1.6807,6.5257,0.3863,0.3148,2.9384,1.3821,0.0249,0.8893,4.6598,1.6297,3.0766,4.3295,6.6687,0.1159,2.9314,0.0234,2.8913,0.0065,1.2723,1.1472,0.8743,2.8003,0.5993,1.8188,2.0372,0.8438,1.5364,5.3729,3.9782,0.0333,3.5962,0.0116,5.6475,7.0879,0.0365,8.4705,0.7656,0.2399,2.0217,0.2659,1.9511,0.3613,4.895,0.0324,4.103,0.0241,4.823,4.122,0.0948,0.7315,0.4134,4.0513,0.5541,2.4757,0.1658,2.8999,3.514,0.0367,3.4136,0.0163,6.0641,0.1396,6.2403,4.4247,0.3638,0.4984,3.4691,0.0945,3.2282,0.0886,3.5071,6.8727,1.0106,5.5739,1.7307,4.3386,0.4976,3.8753,0.0515,1.0371,0.9982,2.7549,4.9409,4.0284,3.7634,6.2175,6.4143,4.253,1.9498,7.2917,3.7819,1.1821,4.1153,2.7678,5.1312,8.0085,1.3542,2.3523,4.9073,2.8881,5.8254,1.5396,3.1717,5.4834,1.6922,0.8781,0.8927,1.7484,2.2702,0.0241,3.0287,0.0043,6.1648,0.8711,0.6677,4.4659,2.8407,1.328,5.1051,1.0975,2.5385,7.6186,3.2877,2.9085,4.0079,6.1262,3.8484,6.0109,0.1261,4.1943,0.0108,0.4153,1.0616,0.0002,6.2331,3.868,0.718,2.2996,6.0864,2.551,5.388,0.6153,2.8438,0.925,0.8693,0.0071,1.0076,1.0133,3.7025,2.5966,0.6639,1.8783,2.0575,5.4848,4.9322,0.9255,1.1184,4.5052,3.4848,3.2426,7.3051,4.2656,2.4591,4.1922,4.1266,5.0118,3.8939,4.548,6.7266,5.2612,0.6759,7.5709,2.2247,2.1913,3.0387,5.5047,1.3673,5.3379,7.2563,1.3296,1.9722,4.8356,5.5603,0.2841,6.4701,0.0357,1.0569,5.483,1.5878,3.8934,5.3409,7.1388,0.8712,2.616,0.026,2.8009,0.0099,4.726,0.905,4.4612,3.5855,1.3917,0.4762,4.4872,3.6718,0.7597,1.4059,2.9074,6.1037,5.4366,1.0707,3.4128,5.2028,0.9412,3.9218,6.5589,3.472,8.1961,4.2539,4.5826,1.3946,5.2477,4.4212,0.038,2.1601,6.3516,1.0584,4.2899,2.0118,3.8085,0.0312,2.4576,0.0171,4.1936,0.8317,6.5482,1.815,0.5437,0.131,4.9608,5.4793,1.1002,2.9611,4.0869,2.9928,3.9124,1.6861,6.1169,1.5175]}
{"id":1845,"ended":true,"length":535,"text":"A Mesolithic hunter @ - @ gatherer site dating to the 7th millennium BC at An Corran in < unk > is one of the oldest archaeological sites in Scotland. Its occupation is probably the earliest known on the Scottish mainland.\n\nIn addition a settlement was found in the modern village of Gartan, < unk > (3) on the banks of the River Ayr. This is now thought to be the 5th millennium BC.\n\nAn Corran Site\n\nThe settlement at An Corran (Scottish Gaelic: An Corran) is the largest and most complex on the Scottish mainland and was probably occupied from about 7,700 to 4,500 BC.\n\nIn the village there are cairns of huge masonry structures and the remains of a building on the banks of the River Ayr ; all suggest that there was a sizable population.\n\nThe most impressive structures are the cairn-towers which form the largest group on the isle and possibly on the entire Scottish mainland.\n\nThe cairns are about 100 feet high and 30 feet wide, they are constructed with stones and boulders and are built in tiers up to the second floor and topped by a roof. At the summit the roof is pierced by a series of holes which were presumably for openings up to the level of the surface.\n\nIn addition to the cairn-towers there are a number of small stone structures built close to each other on a hillside above the settlement of about 15ft,\n\nThe stone structures are of similar size and construction as the tiers of the cairns and could also have been used as defensive enclosures.\n\nThere are also a number of circular structures of similar construction and design, apparently made from the same material. All of these stone structures have a depth of 15 to 30 feet and are about 2 to 5 feet across.\n\nThe cairn-towers are arranged in a straight row with the largest of the latter being the tallest. The buildings which were found near the river are less complex in design and are mainly round with an area of \u200b\u200babout 15 feet in diameter.\n\nAerial Photograph\n\nHere are some images of the above taken during the summer of 2010.\n\nThe village itself is approximately 9miles from the nearest land feature on either side of Ayr river.\n\nThe village itself appeared at the level of a large hill. Below the settlement there is a level area of \u200b\u200bmarshes which could be part of a small lake.

{"id":4370,"ended":true,"length":570,"text":"The accident investigation concluded that the crash was primarily attributable to Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders'inadequate reactions to the previous incidents involving Holland, and the sequence of events and decisions that transpired on the aircraft between the first accident and the second one. Holland and the flight engineer were both evaluated as having probable emotional difficulties. Holland was also determined to be having an alcohol problem that was \"more acute than generally understood\" and possibly related to the incident on the space shuttle Challenger. His drinking problems were \"serious enough\" that they warranted placing him in confinement.\n\nThe Air Force investigation into the crash of an MQ-1 Predator reconnaissance drone into the Arabian Sea concluded that the crash was primarily due to the pilot's use of alcohol, personality, and pilot error. However, the investigation did not find any mechanical or structural defects in the aircraft.\n\nThe Air Force released an investigation of their second military drone crash in the last 19 months on November 7, 2003. A P-3 Orion had crashed in the North Arabian Sea on October 18, and all hands had been lost.\n\nThe incident was attributed to the pilot's use of alcohol and bad attitudes. A series of incidents, some directly related to the use of alcohol and\/or other drugs, caused the rest of the flight crew to \"lose confidence in the pilot and his performance.\"\n\nU.S. Naval Reserve Photo\n\nThe U.S. Air Force completed an accidental death review (ADR) of the crash of a remotely piloted Reaper drone into the Arabian Sea on June 30, 2003. All three pilots on board had at some time in the recent past been under a program to screen military pilots for drug or alcohol use. The ADR noted the potential for pilot dysfunction and impaired judgment.\n\nThe investigation of the crash of a MQ-4C Predator UAV into the Arabian Sea found that it was mostly the fault of the pilot's lack of experience, but also that the helicopter crew of the surveillance aircraft could have done better in assessing the crash pilot's ability to fly the aircraft.\n\nThe Air Force is considering whether to investigate the pilot's use of drugs and alcohol which may have contributed to the June 7, 2003 crash. A Reaper UAV crashed over the Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia in an accident that ended in all four crewmembers' deaths.\n\nAt least 1 crewmember of a Predator UAV was reported to have been exhibiting drug and\/or alcohol symptoms prior to the November 2002 crash of the Predator over the Persian Gulf. This incident was one of three U.S. Air Force MQ-1 Predators that crashed in 18 days and involved three different crewmembers, which led to allegations that the crew members were not properly screened for alcohol or drug use.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has now launched an investigation into a Predator crash in which there were indications that the pilot may have been under the influence of an intoxicant. According to the Air Force official, the crash was caused by pilot error, and the findings of the investigation may not be released.","token_len":630,"entropy":[10.0529,6.4472,5.9005,0.7255,1.2419,4.6357,1.1469,6.8533,5.506,0.0018,11.5775,0.4484,9.6067,2.3749,3.22,1.727,16.1976,7.9446,7.4596,12.7905,3.3692,0.2271,7.1368,0.5729,0.9917,9.2025,3.5839,5.8774,3.0383,1.0271,0.3792,1.6453,9.3927,0.1151,0.0749,4.7225,6.0975,1.6449,6.237,3.6872,1.0078,5.7116,6.676,1.3682,2.9949,3.6706,0.1959,0.2784,0.6561,3.0381,0.2916,4.4466,3.7774,2.2044,4.4094,3.3142,1.792,2.4151,5.7471,3.4925,1.7714,8.1969,6.2414,5.7397,1.4671,3.1944,1.4002,2.6821,4.8456,0.1211,0.7374,4.155,2.6238,4.1878,1.1384,3.2219,1.7427,4.1458,4.5131,4.9969,1.0668,8.048,3.7374,1.949,0.9906,5.1833,3.3488,0.035,1.9577,4.8483,4.2664,1.0726,9.0448,0.3909,2.2139,0.5713,4.9067,5.3633,1.8365,1.0871,3.842,5.6081,0.9506,2.7955,1.0344,3.3055,3.4273,8.5738,0.4821,1.2873,7.1377,1.9664,2.0859,0.0069,2.034,3.4087,0.0873,4.5079,3.4555,0.4512,1.437,2.7045,4.7689,5.3953,2.386,0.0117,1.8187,3.9134,5.3965,3.0178,3.7443,0.7777,6.4824,0.2618,4.2991,0.1841,1.5753,2.3364,0.6998,3.101,1.2534,0.0056,2.2131,3.0092,0.354,5.6639,0.0059,2.6425,1.9844,10.1695,2.1955,0.2495,8.384,3.0956,0.6591,3.0761,0.0208,1.2048,1.9125,2.8032,0.3508,1.674,1.126,9.0569,1.9063,2.4626,2.5358,1.4812,0.1495,1.2695,1.3471,1.7452,0.0002,1.5506,1.5189,0.0067,5.3709,3.01,2.8688,2.553,6.3316,6.8214,6.4554,3.3128,2.2385,2.2394,3.1015,4.6487,7.1825,0.4327,5.0068,3.4786,3.2903,0.144,3.8035,0.6688,3.9253,7.3909,0.7905,1.0833,0.9424,4.6752,1.8291,1.8431,0.9943,4.9552,3.2706,0.0961,1.7613,2.2232,3.7507,0.0973,4.3843,5.7317,8.8632,3.3258,0.3247,5.8401,1.2794,2.6615,0.0002,1.4441,4.281,1.8088,5.5315,0.1167,1.7632,2.6685,0.704,2.5922,0.0051,0.5375,1.6184,7.0897,5.8178,1.6844,3.7592,5.9414,0.003,3.07,2.9249,4.3476,7.8864,0.5817,0.0147,1.4057,4.9346,0.0098,0.1542,2.0188,4.6414,0.001,3.7881,0.9358,0.5208,3.9762,1.1227,8.4897,0.2158,0.0866,3.487,0.9727,0.1648,3.905,4.4614,0.1691,4.192,1.0471,1.3984,1.8245,1.7338,2.553,3.7869,0.9347,1.1773,0.0002,6.3971,0.3066,0.0084,0.0256,5.1294,4.1491,8.8857,1.7948,0.0002,1.4445,4.4504,0.0028,0.0013,0.0026,1.5407,0.0105,6.338,1.9751,9.2508,4.2922,3.0961,5.1804,4.1761,0.3152,0.075,1.2012,0.7951,3.2334,2.1889,1.7638,6.7075,0.1486,0.0,7.4601,0.9114,3.8459,0.1032,0.4224,0.0207,0.5979,3.8511,3.1999,0.0284,1.9418,0.3252,5.1435,3.3974,1.8786,3.889,1.6889,2.5447,6.3169,3.3599,2.2493,4.3579,0.8883,8.0665,0.0198,1.1639,3.5372,3.9919,7.1011,1.9623,6.268,6.0637,2.4187,0.6262,3.4645,1.8784,0.1107,0.8542,0.5366,1.504,1.7658,0.0048,4.4684,3.0349,5.5444,0.7098,5.0304,7.8569,1.251,5.0117,1.6603,1.3647,1.1927,0.0002,0.9285,4.0436,2.9728,0.2886,1.661,0.7352,1.3938,3.6822,0.0137,0.0033,6.0665,3.8647,2.3577,8.0563,0.283,0.5197,0.1664,0.2591,0.0178,2.6981,0.7331,3.2266,0.7776,6.4302,3.9423,3.3844,0.004,0.5703,0.7011,1.475,3.7677,0.0012,3.8148,2.614,4.1959,1.6089,1.6216,0.9879,5.7873,4.3219,4.6067,0.2753,7.9789,1.2283,4.4197,1.9083,4.4841,2.3037,2.6627,6.0407,0.6464,4.803,6.7954,0.5631,2.8273,0.0986,3.5734,1.869,1.1092,0.9238,1.0275,0.0002,0.8522,1.3797,0.0073,5.0704,4.1748,3.4276,0.7771,4.6198,0.9289,3.3129,0.3273,2.1506,0.0054,2.3677,1.4153,0.3964,6.9243,2.3578,0.1997,0.9804,0.0435,0.1547,9.386,4.7977,1.1692,0.0645,1.0488,0.5323,3.5931,9.4729,4.1259,0.0142,2.9813,4.2998,0.7222,5.1757,0.0189,3.4731,0.5416,0.2701,0.0038,4.4449,2.2359,4.7376,1.5208,1.1565,4.8073,2.0372,7.4439,2.3491,0.9412,1.6234,2.4841,0.1889,0.198,0.8244,0.0003,6.1371,1.9328,4.3034,4.1283,0.3485,2.5404,1.9184,3.3318,1.5318,0.0056,1.0826,4.0496,1.4027,0.1362,0.8478,9.3822,3.93,2.1467,2.1013,0.0011,0.0249,4.7492,4.4381,0.0037,0.3348,7.1864,7.0678,0.6966,2.1929,0.6626,2.5122,5.9483,0.4359,3.6191,0.0034,0.3876,3.6137,2.4761,1.3215,4.0746,0.0752,3.0326,4.741,2.3307,0.0009,0.0706,3.5876,0.0145,5.8543,0.0227,0.0141,0.687,4.3419,1.3443,1.2937,1.6145,8.8097,4.3841,3.0734,3.653,3.3678,4.1273,2.8079,0.5825,2.3766,4.1397,2.949,0.3768,5.6527,0.8826,0.7041,1.8354,2.0469,1.2898,3.087,2.1256,2.9252,0.8615,2.2037,1.7308,1.5947,0.4146,0.3595,0.5331,0.0002,1.1357,2.9649,0.0045,0.0021,0.0018,1.1447,0.003,1.947,4.538,3.7438,0.8453,0.4613,0.5349,2.9695,4.2839,2.8357,1.6092,3.3016,5.1942,1.1255,4.9572,0.4024,0.8058,1.4856,2.478,0.077,0.7173,1.8188,1.0781,0.0112,0.1082,4.8683,2.3659,0.7363,0.0093,0.8885,4.4174,0.0021,0.7345,1.2853,0.0044,6.8389,1.1331,1.0071,3.6123,1.4058,1.7581,0.1235,5.0473,0.7082,1.6889,1.8079,1.5114,5.381,1.0274,0.456,1.27,2.9866,2.8189,0.9309,4.3588,3.872]}

{"id":2122,"ended":true,"length":560,"text":"Wilhelm Busch was born on 15 April 1832, the first of seven children to the marriage of Henriette Kleine and Friedrich Wilhelm Busch. His six siblings followed shortly after : Fanny ( 1834 ), Franziska ( 1836 ), Wilhelmina ( 1841 ), Ferdinand ( 1844 ), Clara ( 1846 ) and Anna ( 1848 ). His father was born in Leuthen and served as an officer in the Prussian cavalry ( 1782 -1826 ) and his father retired to Munich, working as a schoolmaster and private tutor. Henriette was a housekeeper and a talented artist herself and the family lived in Munich and Munich, Munich, and then in St. Gallen, which was Frederick the Great favorite home. Busch had two sisters and one brother, but his only sister died as an infant. Busch was educated in his mother\u2019s home and later in St. Gallen. He was a member of the Munich Society of Fine Arts, an amateur painter, and had his first exhibition in 1848 where his work was very heavily rejected.In 1852 Busch went to Berlin where he met with a great success and met many other artists and visited their studios studying art and life. In the same year he was the subject of a popular painting called \u201cWilhelm Busch. A Wandering Artist\u201d where he is playing the flute in the park. This painting came to popularise his work at the same time that many other artists wanted to paint him. In 1860 he traveled to Vienna, Budapest, Paris, London and Amsterdam, where he visited art academies and enjoyed the fine arts of both countries. Busch had a great deal of success in the 19th century in Germany and was known as the \u201cPrince of Miniature Painters\u201d. He painted many portraits and was also known for many \u201clife studies\u201d. His early works are noted as lacking detail and he showed little skill, but after studying the great artists of the past and learning from his contemporaries, he developed a great deal in this area. His work showed a great deal of improvement over the next year and even later in his short career. His work was highly sought after for its realism and he was even allowed to show what he wanted at the St. Gallen exhibition in 1880. It was during this time that he came into contact with the great artist Franz Xaver Sibylle von Stolzing who told him that his skills were lacking and made a request that Busch not try to imitate any of the great masters of the past but rather to try his best and see what came of it. With von Stolzing\u2019s advice, Wilhelm studied the classic art style of the 18th century and with the help of the critic Eduard Hoffmann. When he came back to his home he made many \u201cprogresses\u201d in his painting as did others at the time. His work was highly praised and his work was exhibited in many cities and towns across Germany and Austria. In 1883 Busch died of tuberculosis in Munich.","token_len":630,"entropy":[10.8841,9.8438,0.5684,3.756,2.4502,1.5821,4.7295,2.5149,0.9802,4.3097,1.7123,3.0794,3.7427,2.01,3.146,0.347,2.6124,2.5126,8.7631,0.3409,5.667,3.0759,9.6017,2.5675,2.6072,5.9183,4.4329,0.1674,0.0039,0.4852,3.3672,6.8737,2.648,4.8377,3.7337,0.6704,9.5517,5.8792,1.7722,2.8841,7.9855,2.4132,1.9606,5.408,3.2015,0.0052,0.3094,0.2719,1.8262,0.1714,6.3184,2.5737,1.7239,0.1294,0.1429,0.1381,3.8639,0.1971,5.3311,0.2882,0.114,1.9303,0.1963,6.2155,0.2176,0.0901,1.4667,2.5073,0.1603,4.5065,0.1506,0.1978,1.0634,0.2628,3.3071,2.286,1.6386,3.5122,0.7139,5.1626,6.122,2.6991,2.8998,5.4222,1.052,2.5008,1.8813,0.6693,0.3064,4.6351,0.0267,5.2405,4.3683,4.596,4.4766,2.1372,4.011,5.013,1.5825,1.1089,4.8814,4.1847,6.1804,0.8289,5.0301,2.1161,8.4741,0.8895,0.3438,5.3566,2.2713,2.3727,6.021,2.2388,0.7834,5.7749,0.058,2.011,2.0302,8.3819,3.87,1.2443,2.4451,7.3462,3.4013,7.1221,3.4445,3.8065,2.5528,2.8796,0.6479,4.9753,2.6656,4.318,2.235,3.2409,1.1743,2.4783,6.0836,1.7415,3.6123,1.4556,3.2643,0.3163,1.4595,3.8723,1.2691,9.1292,3.0251,0.1166,12.5865,3.905,2.2306,8.4004,0.0021,2.9896,2.5962,1.6614,1.5764,1.8869,0.5415,1.6028,2.8254,2.1786,4.3948,2.042,2.2486,5.5531,3.5589,0.2398,1.1927,3.5166,0.0022,1.7565,3.6093,1.4804,4.5865,2.3405,15.5026,7.8555,2.5891,3.2048,1.3622,3.9409,1.8765,3.1199,0.1223,0.4842,0.0088,1.2775,1.2989,1.5938,1.7409,2.8354,0.0129,0.1854,5.4046,4.4692,0.4041,4.8096,0.292,1.4914,3.7716,3.6185,2.8087,1.3528,0.9257,3.8583,3.3596,0.9246,3.437,1.1821,0.904,3.0459,5.4022,3.3152,2.1086,0.6241,6.8481,5.7525,7.0197,0.6666,7.6632,0.5326,2.8405,2.0068,0.0024,3.9192,0.3588,3.9985,2.0575,0.1668,2.7824,3.8051,3.2233,4.3574,4.3647,2.1307,4.7566,4.9103,2.6052,0.8139,1.7642,8.7682,4.7227,1.8827,11.0559,4.5653,1.6923,5.2449,0.7521,2.1916,2.8283,1.9476,0.0622,0.4548,2.2977,4.785,2.7306,0.0188,0.7591,4.8282,3.5958,2.1511,8.0426,5.1005,7.1134,0.0225,0.8314,0.007,3.1577,4.0459,12.9045,0.5746,2.8658,7.7968,6.3923,7.3759,0.7615,5.4128,9.7697,2.1713,6.0278,0.1369,2.0755,1.3359,6.0741,1.9016,4.375,1.8411,5.8066,0.7296,7.2676,6.5641,2.097,1.5314,5.5393,0.6154,2.9156,0.0323,1.3551,4.1777,1.3574,2.2336,5.0532,0.5207,4.3538,3.6741,0.7277,2.3366,4.6304,1.3688,5.1774,0.3495,2.4742,2.0949,8.673,0.5437,2.6616,0.6035,3.6078,0.9807,4.0911,1.8787,1.8722,0.1739,3.8508,6.2471,5.4412,0.0,1.0493,6.0987,1.803,6.252,1.1395,2.5203,4.1496,1.9593,0.1788,2.11,0.0016,3.4307,1.394,2.5108,2.1026,0.2346,1.1604,1.1292,1.8467,4.3566,0.0228,0.2808,2.9315,3.2437,1.0473,2.7202,4.9748,1.2024,1.0309,7.0065,0.4782,7.2839,0.4149,10.8281,0.2132,6.917,0.0494,1.5527,0.6612,2.3315,1.3648,4.3098,3.0696,4.7774,1.5891,2.7708,2.8417,1.7887,1.3937,4.3438,10.0635,0.1233,8.4642,7.6335,0.8971,0.4877,0.6798,2.9834,5.3801,1.9466,2.9958,6.8243,1.6471,8.8809,5.4677,1.0256,3.3871,5.9461,2.3956,4.0746,3.9654,1.4193,4.7115,5.28,2.5289,5.016,3.5211,1.32,1.1109,3.9335,3.1696,3.6487,1.4085,3.0528,2.8228,0.8101,0.5161,3.4377,1.0717,2.1478,2.9268,3.2822,3.8507,1.078,0.3783,2.9804,2.3216,5.6305,2.1807,1.571,1.5892,0.1351,5.7861,2.8864,0.7279,4.6461,4.8846,1.3794,4.7382,5.4213,1.7249,3.3595,6.3727,3.1058,1.9824,3.0037,2.2147,1.5218,4.1645,3.7525,0.0646,3.7851,1.5862,3.6886,0.6701,4.0384,1.3975,4.1818,5.8707,0.2175,4.4303,5.8794,0.5708,3.5112,4.9378,1.1753,5.1779,1.0969,0.2508,0.0255,1.9153,2.3226,5.0777,0.3017,4.1802,0.7735,3.5749,0.7473,1.2746,0.1799,0.9509,4.5622,2.6455,0.7908,0.0061,1.5276,2.9027,3.3944,4.428,10.0941,5.2282,8.1519,6.6586,2.6404,4.216,5.1278,3.5091,4.1796,9.2336,3.4344,6.2204,0.2755,0.8527,2.6526,8.5653,1.0815,5.1542,1.046,6.3174,3.8201,3.3947,2.0325,1.7405,0.003,5.3887,5.6439,0.5834,2.7614,3.5732,0.4601,1.0929,1.0764,3.3945,1.5325,0.9756,2.211,3.4348,2.1843,0.8906,3.1889,2.1713,1.6898,2.5386,4.1037,0.9609,5.666,1.0021,1.9724,0.1841,5.2834,8.2774,0.6474,0.0202,0.0028,10.491,4.221,1.1593,2.7911,1.054,9.7957,7.8059,2.2733,7.1736,4.9149,5.6065,0.6581,1.329,2.8882,0.074,0.2444,0.9331,5.0128,1.8328,0.9101,0.0211,2.2583,9.7228,7.6698,0.0369,7.2528,0.3174,5.6693,4.5374,2.3534,2.8299,2.6852,0.5048,3.4325,1.577,2.6495,4.2583,3.2092,9.098,0.0179,7.7783,3.755,0.2838,0.2697,1.8833,1.1691,2.0857,4.0275,5.2315,3.6275,5.1393,0.5649,1.9423,0.4683,3.1528,1.9266,1.2911,3.4525,1.7068,1.397,2.7079,2.0091,1.0885,2.0852,1.0507,1.7449,3.8768,1.7089,4.6058,3.4213,1.6495,1.7219,1.2816,0.4655,2.225,1.0634,1.9175,1.2657,0.0039,4.1932,2.2029,2.429,2.0759,1.4216,1.022]}
{"id":3537,"ended":true,"length":530,"text":"To design and build his ship Nansen chose Colin Archer, Norway's leading shipbuilder and naval architect. Archer was well known for a particular hull design that combined seaworthiness with a shallow draught, good seabreeze-handling ability, and a comfortable interior layout. The hull was constructed of wood, and its main strength came from an enlarged beam-to-length ratio and an internal \"beater chamber\" (watertight bulkhead). The resulting draft was not excessively shallow; Archer achieved a \"slightly\" down-hill trim, and the ship's crew described its handling characteristics as excellent and seaworthy.\n\nOn completion, Nansen decided to put the ship to use quickly by sailing north from Trondheim to the Svalbard Islands on 1 August 1893. She sailed on to Longyearbyen, the town that would serve as the base of operations for several years. Her chief mission during her first season in the Arctic was to carry Norwegians on seal hunts and supply mail and passengers to the island settlements that made up the northern part of Svalbard. She was also used extensively by whalers and explorers who made their way north for polar bear and bowhead whale hunting.\n\nDuring her first winter, Nansen decided to improve her equipment; one of his goals was the installation of electricity. He also wanted to replace the ship's wooden deck with an ice-strengthened steel one. He completed these projects in September 1894 and early 1895 and spent much of 1895 and 1896 sailing between Longyearbyen and the island settlements. His return trips to Europe had to be made at regular intervals during the Arctic summer, and the ship's wintertime operations were inauspicious. In the early winter of 1896-97, the ship left Longyearbyen for Copenhagen without her winter outfit of ice-strengthened masts, cables, ropes, and anchors. When she returned to Longyearbyen the next summer, her cargo of steel anchors weighed down the ship so heavily that she was unable to return to Europe until June 1897. In February 1898, Nansen left Longyearbyen for home. The ship crossed the Atlantic on three occasions before she reached Port Arthur.\n\nNansen took his ship for one last journey back to Svalbard in 1899 and early 1900, before she was finally dismantled. She was eventually sold to a scrapyard in Stavanger, Norway, where she was stripped of her masts, ropes, cables and engines after being abandoned for nearly a year. For a century, Nansen's log and some of her documents were on display in Longyearbyen. Her name was eventually placed on the municipal register of Svalbard.\n\nNansen is also the namesake of Nansen Stations, the Norwegian Polar Institute's bases on the Antarctic continent. He was the first to discover Antarctica with a whaling ship; the Nansen-operated Svalbard Station was built in 1914 and named in his honor. The Nansen research ship has been used for many scientific explorations since it was commissioned.","token_len":631,"entropy":[8.5899,2.6248,1.124,6.4213,6.5714,9.0976,6.7998,10.3407,12.439,9.3433,1.027,11.886,0.0526,3.4165,3.2746,1.1766,1.4846,4.8551,1.95,0.7823,1.9175,1.8274,4.7658,0.7008,0.6057,5.3017,5.6165,6.8174,0.4318,1.9746,5.9837,7.6462,2.1685,0.0161,0.9149,2.4632,7.1108,8.4281,0.0466,2.2483,6.597,5.8522,2.1279,3.2038,0.1846,6.7488,6.8659,0.0572,3.5943,0.7657,0.2596,1.6585,6.4415,5.0893,4.5181,0.3962,2.6069,3.4115,1.451,3.255,2.0526,4.7184,1.3801,2.0801,4.6549,4.2108,5.0597,3.7951,0.1028,3.907,6.7538,5.3692,4.5531,4.0558,0.0681,8.6774,2.8752,2.8366,2.8783,4.9937,6.237,6.4078,3.9295,5.6744,0.6461,3.5284,6.7804,2.9446,6.7046,0.4177,1.3657,1.3879,6.1203,8.3823,1.7487,5.0333,6.1139,2.7798,4.121,4.7959,6.7973,1.1092,5.0317,4.3119,2.5907,3.2919,6.6136,1.877,5.5838,7.8121,2.5314,1.8408,1.7096,2.4423,1.417,5.6543,8.3739,3.0448,5.5218,3.3063,0.7497,5.352,3.115,8.0455,0.1361,0.2448,1.2117,0.0075,4.7975,4.9203,1.3087,2.1831,0.0035,4.2114,0.2647,4.7889,1.1676,1.2205,2.1449,2.711,7.5991,4.074,5.6042,5.3731,2.6545,7.0165,0.5496,0.0094,1.5886,2.1931,5.4266,1.4906,0.002,3.4753,3.1882,5.7909,2.4098,6.2723,0.4174,6.7993,3.2545,3.3499,2.5213,7.2311,5.0278,1.8523,3.3085,1.1701,3.5001,6.5235,3.571,2.8636,4.9268,0.0602,0.7644,2.0873,0.8199,3.0356,0.4292,5.7344,1.5355,1.3048,4.329,7.2356,3.3288,4.9729,2.2324,2.6288,6.4686,3.324,1.2705,3.9588,0.3502,0.251,4.7588,11.0114,0.3811,0.0456,0.0074,3.2625,10.295,3.6836,1.9026,7.1338,9.3253,4.2355,6.7247,1.5545,1.195,4.5571,7.0866,3.9323,4.4496,0.1634,0.627,3.8597,2.5581,0.0025,5.7147,0.0022,0.0001,0.3525,2.4833,1.7202,2.0153,4.8849,4.3542,2.1568,8.9661,1.5173,0.0049,1.6265,5.4193,2.7871,4.3905,1.6901,0.2296,2.5166,4.1743,6.3021,4.31,2.91,8.3829,3.159,3.8203,1.3701,0.7982,1.0645,0.0001,3.3749,0.9397,1.0529,3.6385,1.1176,0.677,0.0014,5.5412,0.2086,6.9014,1.1904,5.506,6.2131,5.3401,0.5071,7.1915,5.1899,0.1432,4.0181,3.1905,0.0283,8.6082,3.4262,3.3924,2.3883,2.4424,0.3371,4.8579,0.9452,4.2063,0.3435,5.4002,3.0452,0.943,2.8147,4.2903,0.5413,6.7793,3.0989,0.1921,0.0676,3.5787,2.2801,1.445,2.8827,6.1777,4.5055,3.5192,1.3444,3.1405,2.4085,0.2807,1.6066,6.1468,1.1534,2.5813,3.5535,2.7951,0.0391,3.3997,2.4165,0.5064,4.6326,4.7634,5.0046,0.2338,0.0025,0.0015,0.1653,1.9211,3.6871,2.3325,1.2918,3.7838,6.1747,7.0839,1.497,6.6531,4.5887,4.2488,0.6119,3.7838,3.6366,6.3881,0.0155,3.3066,0.7466,6.3909,2.7556,1.3005,1.3426,2.6236,1.1692,1.8168,4.0576,6.5792,3.8167,0.8001,4.6153,10.5715,0.0002,0.0004,1.0487,2.988,2.3122,2.5513,3.0874,0.996,1.3488,3.3834,0.2946,0.4342,1.9474,0.6104,5.1668,2.3189,0.0247,0.0007,0.0054,1.4222,5.342,6.8145,3.2316,7.1105,7.2248,5.7208,1.8611,0.5195,0.5276,0.0001,0.4318,0.0316,7.6752,0.9639,1.3665,7.2041,0.1761,6.6119,0.2247,0.5509,5.1018,0.437,4.4986,1.2812,1.3938,0.8204,2.3367,0.0116,0.0007,0.004,3.9484,1.3876,2.2969,0.1951,2.6492,4.9466,1.4854,5.8066,5.3586,5.4679,6.1437,2.4669,0.6306,6.175,2.4625,0.2517,1.8371,1.3745,1.5727,0.0042,3.5481,0.3902,5.4706,2.1364,3.9089,1.9741,0.2943,3.2523,4.5616,0.7325,0.2524,1.7266,0.0017,3.4058,1.9337,0.0091,0.0004,0.0072,1.1367,7.7756,2.2164,3.0157,1.1595,7.2223,0.4591,2.6266,1.9706,5.7875,2.2607,2.9843,3.1374,2.9712,5.2741,2.6477,2.5199,1.1571,0.0002,1.888,0.0081,4.8685,4.6682,2.2736,3.4575,4.8281,3.6374,4.592,3.5359,0.1604,3.2852,0.0024,0.0002,1.2944,3.7664,2.4769,7.7167,0.1363,1.2045,4.1776,2.2133,1.8736,3.5391,5.7318,1.9427,1.8136,0.7633,4.7051,2.3681,0.6326,2.1251,7.8565,0.9523,0.9707,3.912,3.3447,0.0895,0.4987,0.3679,0.8699,1.8209,0.8958,1.0192,6.3206,0.5772,1.2463,4.7307,0.0316,1.0281,4.4708,0.085,4.057,2.9211,6.0393,5.8071,2.5182,3.7047,1.0734,2.263,1.4519,1.2769,0.3037,5.6166,2.6823,5.1769,0.9246,1.2725,0.0009,1.833,9.1207,4.7339,6.2934,0.4664,0.382,5.3306,1.5676,4.9388,0.1717,0.9638,7.0033,0.034,0.001,0.0145,1.6681,3.3225,3.6431,1.2032,4.4392,4.6721,0.6951,0.8485,9.8353,3.2576,0.4894,2.1174,0.0486,0.0023,1.9283,0.6597,0.0002,1.9719,0.023,3.602,4.6506,2.5756,5.3371,0.1302,5.0006,0.9625,5.862,6.9169,0.8998,2.1586,3.2857,7.9057,5.4438,2.3912,10.7631,2.9778,0.9418,4.5958,2.2517,0.3982,6.0051,1.4496,2.1664,0.8852,2.009,5.384,5.3034,4.2205,1.8226,7.1665,0.4637,0.8515,3.9117,2.3716,5.3325,0.1588,4.8284,5.7702,4.8303,0.0614,0.0018,3.9148,1.2961,2.3951,0.6627,5.1863,1.4588,3.9861,2.7768,3.1182,0.1533,1.0645,2.2992,2.7482,0.0171,8.5333,2.0744,4.0938,0.8156,2.796,2.0051,2.7499,3.032,6.8187,0.0783,3.4429,3.1665,0.4753,2.9812,3.7775]}
{"id":590,"ended":false,"length":551,"text":"Helium \u2013 cadmium lasers are a common source of blue @ - @ ultraviolet laser light. They operate at either 325 or 422 nm in fluorescence microscopes and various laboratory experiments. Cadmium selenide is one of the best known selenium lasers, with a pulse duration around 1 nm, and a linewidth, linewidth of around 200 ps in a laser with a cavity loss of about 10 % (a linewidth of around 10 pm can be achieved using a smaller cavity). The efficiency of the laser system is strongly dependent on the power supply and the operating temperature. The thermal efficiency is around 38 and the optical efficiency is about 3 % for 300 mW laser power.\n\nFor applications in biology and chemistry, it is possible that only very weakly visible and non-visible laser sources work to excite fluorophores for labeling. The most frequently used are at a wavelength of 320-330 nm. Helium laser light in the frequency range of 400 nm corresponds to an ultraviolet wavelength (approximately 315 nm in the red end of the visible range), which is more strongly visible. The advantage of the helium laser radiation consists of the long duration of the pulses, which leads to increased time for excitation and to a sufficient amount of heat for labeling the DNA.\n\nFor excitation of DNA in liquid samples, the laser wavelength can be varied as widely as needed. A typical value for 400 nm is around 450 nm at a power of 300 mW, which is equivalent to an optimum power of 1 W for a standard lab set-up. To obtain high signal of the excitation laser, it is necessary to have at least 50 mW-power, comparable to the output power of the standard fluorescence microscope. In liquid samples it is of advantage to use the UV excitation laser with wavelength between 350-450 nm and at a power of 15 mW. Depending on the application, a combination of different lasers is often required to excite different fluorophores.\n\nThe duration of the excitation can be increased by using larger amounts of laser pulse power. For DNA labeling and other molecular labeling, a laser pulse duration of about 100 ps at 300 mW laser power is optimal.\n\nFor the detection of fluorescent labeling during fluorescence microscopy, the use of two or more lasers would be required in addition to the excitation source. Both for excitation and emission, it is usually necessary to have a high-purity, high-efficiency laser source and a high-power laser amplifier or oscillator. The laser should be compact, reliable, inexpensive, and easy to operate, so that the optical microscope can be used repeatedly. With such a laser system, several applications can be realized, which are not possible with other methods.\n\nUsing a spectrometer for quantitative measurements in real-time is a time-consuming method, and also the analysis of the results are laborious with a time consumption of about 5 hours.\n\nThe laser system Helium excitation laser and spectrometer can be used in almost every field of science, e.g.:","token_len":631,"entropy":[7.9573,5.8232,11.7903,0.5138,0.0001,9.6346,1.5005,2.5658,3.2851,2.332,0.2152,5.3043,14.1402,7.8035,6.4748,9.0146,4.722,1.3771,0.9706,2.4504,6.1199,1.076,7.5012,9.546,1.4789,8.488,1.2009,3.1186,8.2813,0.092,8.8584,4.5198,1.9176,9.1518,7.3198,2.4783,0.5128,5.9793,0.0367,0.0006,10.3537,0.2822,2.2003,1.3878,3.6012,0.1485,0.236,4.2068,1.2053,7.1941,0.0028,1.4347,0.3895,1.8805,2.6783,1.7057,6.6997,3.1046,5.6172,2.4086,4.5584,2.09,1.504,2.0289,12.2019,4.0555,0.0066,6.4838,9.2535,0.6159,0.002,1.733,3.8999,4.2793,9.3915,6.6544,2.8335,3.3181,3.2472,0.8741,7.5944,10.375,0.3561,1.8621,2.5668,4.5061,2.7049,5.541,7.5419,0.0141,0.0019,0.3458,2.1263,2.8693,6.1812,5.9506,0.5448,2.4869,2.8139,1.0419,6.1287,3.5484,2.0445,1.8759,5.7742,0.3293,1.3304,1.1886,5.4833,0.6369,7.053,0.8845,0.1356,0.3817,4.6176,3.9257,1.7529,1.197,4.5063,1.2271,1.0192,1.5481,5.2001,2.1797,1.551,3.9144,6.5885,5.482,1.723,3.6613,2.1406,0.816,1.5361,3.5811,2.9114,3.7732,6.7738,3.2632,1.4685,3.1141,3.319,0.6622,1.7142,0.0072,4.9474,5.8811,2.25,6.8549,1.4761,3.1377,0.2913,3.581,0.3237,1.7252,3.4867,6.3672,4.3646,4.0358,2.92,4.8321,3.4753,4.2771,0.3989,2.4921,3.2091,3.5055,6.1444,4.3586,6.8538,0.0412,7.897,4.0364,0.6974,7.5823,10.1965,1.4129,2.2,3.7837,5.5051,0.5193,6.7057,5.8303,3.9081,2.5549,0.4175,6.6768,3.4204,2.986,0.1074,1.5542,9.1917,0.0351,2.8867,2.6874,4.4743,1.8919,7.7696,0.0631,0.6582,3.4022,3.3408,6.75,0.2462,3.509,4.8964,3.5136,4.131,4.86,6.7237,1.0613,3.9157,1.3761,4.8509,5.8675,0.9114,0.3281,6.8002,3.7811,1.9687,2.1365,0.6649,4.0637,5.613,3.1354,2.6687,1.9811,6.9541,0.1691,1.9796,3.9141,0.5332,6.5239,7.7972,0.5569,1.6519,5.8701,3.4079,0.637,0.7789,5.9552,1.0516,2.0087,5.7212,0.0362,4.5741,6.2088,2.4687,2.8149,0.0651,2.5646,4.0448,2.1591,8.0711,2.8671,0.0414,4.8871,2.5798,5.9099,3.7955,7.7629,1.1197,1.3518,0.0004,3.9705,8.0232,0.0548,0.8654,2.2821,2.3658,5.0357,7.1001,0.4978,1.2195,3.0047,3.7476,2.5587,0.2396,4.9513,3.9294,6.8932,0.0253,6.4596,1.1732,2.9696,2.9155,5.6111,1.3399,6.7153,0.3414,0.7208,4.1199,4.2972,0.4141,4.63,1.6934,5.246,0.3808,3.8533,1.0786,0.0625,1.7186,1.6615,0.6673,3.527,0.0278,3.3436,6.9513,3.3451,0.3257,2.7386,3.6716,2.5346,1.9458,4.7744,5.3972,5.352,2.7981,0.1453,0.5262,4.9351,2.4901,3.869,7.5809,6.2871,1.7071,7.3586,0.112,2.8866,0.7226,2.9187,0.3134,1.1029,0.1053,2.5978,3.885,0.021,3.7635,3.7499,0.6625,6.5846,4.1473,2.3176,7.1036,0.1941,1.2645,4.4094,1.417,0.1991,2.0116,3.424,4.8359,0.1599,1.3989,0.6713,2.8992,5.7962,1.2181,4.7561,0.3609,6.0276,4.2694,0.4344,2.9004,2.7236,6.8794,6.6933,0.0513,1.0859,3.5013,6.7622,3.0152,3.8209,1.4636,1.9919,0.0157,2.7276,3.6949,2.6873,0.4549,0.1134,5.0585,1.9047,0.0196,1.0904,7.0541,0.0659,0.1391,3.8255,0.3699,2.4505,4.8857,0.0452,4.3251,2.794,2.6432,5.103,2.426,1.8962,2.8815,0.0034,4.7237,7.3743,0.0311,0.0588,0.7789,0.9377,0.0003,2.0395,7.6198,0.1775,0.6502,3.0345,0.033,4.1598,0.6934,2.8641,1.3627,1.68,5.9814,3.9651,0.0149,3.5081,6.2762,3.0068,1.0804,2.5162,6.4014,3.9058,3.944,4.0136,4.9418,3.5372,1.4367,2.3533,3.4766,0.5462,3.1295,0.5354,2.3127,3.5283,4.4053,4.3955,3.8131,0.265,0.0781,7.9517,0.3828,0.9052,4.7084,0.6093,2.0671,0.0002,2.7925,2.5926,2.2174,0.1275,4.5195,6.9993,7.4211,4.146,0.009,0.9179,0.0156,0.266,1.0269,3.7035,0.0073,5.0268,2.8514,0.1989,2.3834,5.5464,0.629,2.3153,3.6898,4.0502,0.0056,0.7886,5.9054,0.0154,6.3188,0.4496,5.5691,6.4955,5.9502,0.0155,0.7267,5.7147,1.8269,3.4039,0.2068,5.1062,1.4578,0.0917,1.4676,1.2354,3.7008,3.5903,5.9618,3.6401,2.5701,1.788,0.1904,2.9203,1.6896,1.9231,2.8257,1.3155,1.6127,0.549,1.7625,1.6944,5.7369,4.7487,6.8502,0.5679,0.6712,1.8926,2.9727,5.3499,0.4605,7.0616,1.4952,5.2916,0.7068,3.9322,0.5941,0.5862,3.492,0.0926,1.4597,2.4204,3.2973,0.4447,1.5361,4.6237,8.7993,0.9322,0.6018,0.6852,7.2634,1.1757,5.7422,4.2784,0.8255,1.6638,3.0913,0.1822,5.9215,3.4664,1.2967,0.1157,5.5072,2.2644,3.2866,1.6133,3.6219,2.5934,1.0614,2.5933,3.2982,0.6835,0.4747,0.0002,6.3058,1.4305,7.2755,1.0782,0.0123,2.4784,5.6316,3.3807,3.8947,5.4135,1.0954,0.2486,1.8355,2.1361,7.4886,0.412,0.2436,4.8782,1.8972,1.2269,5.0841,4.2773,8.012,0.2699,1.9192,4.0472,4.7037,6.7018,0.6882,5.3395,2.5587,4.6266,7.8038,0.2291,1.3869,3.1909,2.7674,1.0883,2.1329,0.0002,1.9519,3.3032,1.6605,11.2974,0.009,8.2982,0.5071,1.9006,5.1551,5.7061,0.1066,0.0936,3.7043,0.3161,0.8457,1.6857,6.1619,3.1722,2.9953,1.4201,2.4885,1.4316,7.0125,0.007,0.0016,3.9965]}
{"id":4176,"ended":true,"length":543,"text":"Following a request for proposals seeking a `` signature public artwork `` to be incorporated into the new library, painter and < unk > alumnus Cliff < unk > was awarded the $ 430,000 commission on March 30. The first phase of the selection process involved presentations to the architectural and design community by the proposal evaluators. Three short-listed proposals were then submitted to the Board of Trustees, who chose Mr. < unk > as the artist for the project.\n\nThe final design will include one of the best-known paintings in < unk > history and a significant collection of works by Mr. < unk > along with a new library wing. Cliff < unk > said, `` I want this to be one of the most visible and recognizable works in the city. I want to make people stop and say `hey, there was that good old school, we need to preserve a little part of it.\n\n`` The commission is in many ways the culmination of Mr. < unk >'s career, which has focused heavily on < unk > history and his love of < unk > art and artists. Born in 1930 in New York < unk > and raised in the Bronx < unk >, Cliff < unk > moved to < unk > in 1973, when he married < unk > native Patricia < unk >, an alumna.\n\nAfter spending 25 years at < unk >'s School of Art, Mr. < unk > developed a reputation for working with old pieces of < unk > and for producing works with a significant personal connection to both the material and the artist. In addition to the $ 430,000 commission, the Library Board has contributed $ 150,000 to the project.\n\nThe Board has also agreed to fund a significant expansion of < unk > to accommodate the new art wing, as well as the expansion of the children's room and the current library's new computer area. The expansion will increase library space by 10 percent.\n\nTwo other alumni artists are also working on related projects to enhance the < unk > grounds.

{"id":2757,"ended":true,"length":588,"text":"Even without gravitational evidence, Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna, has argued that Sedna's 12 @, @ 000 @ - @ year orbit means that probability alone suggests that an object like Sedna should exist between Mars and Jupiter (Bridgeton 2004 ; Sedna 2007 ). However, it is possible that a planet that was similar in mass to, say, Mars, and similar in orbital period to Mars, had an encounter with the Sun so close to its formation that the loss of the material around it caused it to be flattened into this very elliptical orbit ( see also Quarco and Sainte-Claire 2008 ). In this case we would expect to only find similar orbits if there had been planets with the same initial conditions as Mars and if the planets in question had been detected as close as Jupiter, for example. The other possibility is that a planet was formed in a similar way to Saturn and Jupiter. The initial mass of the protoplanet was much larger, the orbit had a very small eccentricity and a large precession, due to the effects of the Jupiter - Saturn system, that brought it close to Jupiter. As the planet has grown larger (and the orbit has contracted to a smaller precession and eccentricity ), the encounter with Jupiter has moved it much further away from the Sun, allowing for the current orbit as well as more mass (and an increasing eccentricity ) to accumulate. The final solution would look like Jupiters orbit (but perhaps with a precession of 7@ rather than 20@ ), being gradually flattened until it reaches its current very elongated orbit ( see also Bridgeton 2008 ). We would expect then a detection close by Jupiter or Saturn.\n\nBut what of our current system of planets and moons, and the planet Mars? There are plenty of ways for Mars to have been made, so perhaps it has a similar history to Sedna, or as the next one in line for a planet, after Uranus, Neptune and Pluto of course, which could also be flattened out by a close encounter with the Sun?\n\nWe know very little about the initial mass, size and orbital parameters of Mars in its ancient history, so we cannot rule out such a possibility. We are aware, however, through the measurements of Mars Odyssey which are in the same order of magnitude as the measurements of the orbital properties of Sedna, that Mars has a similar orbit to that at present.\n\nThus, while we do not yet know which route an object like Sedna should take according to the data, it is nevertheless still possible that Sedna could be an artefact produced by a planet with a very similar history to Mars and\/or which lost material which led to it being flattened out into this very elongated orbit. The same applies for our other planets and moons.\n\nHow has the solar system evolved? How do scientists know which planets formed in which orbits? How do they know what the planet's initial mass was? Is there more than one interpretation of the data?\n\nThese are just three of the many questions we will attempt to answer.","token_len":632,"entropy":[6.9534,12.0541,7.213,0.4928,9.7591,4.8905,3.0659,1.5388,10.685,0.0496,0.0099,0.1112,12.3618,0.8626,0.7124,2.5538,5.3866,0.3782,6.3184,0.0029,1.4959,7.7916,12.6331,6.579,4.6242,11.2022,5.0804,5.8532,5.6731,9.2719,4.2141,6.255,0.6641,10.7948,6.553,6.0229,0.5811,4.3693,2.3242,4.2087,1.3559,0.0006,3.6528,4.1666,6.3443,6.1436,0.1249,1.1644,3.7855,5.6374,6.1239,0.9625,4.3976,4.3687,5.5561,6.3051,0.0041,3.2975,0.7332,3.0665,0.0326,3.0693,0.6585,2.8392,0.2909,2.619,2.6894,3.2665,3.1672,6.2336,1.1731,2.556,0.3012,7.3072,2.3489,0.019,3.1195,2.5486,2.6456,4.0117,0.325,3.2046,3.5717,0.3517,2.1119,2.0259,4.7236,2.4008,6.6359,0.2125,2.0843,1.1099,5.8974,3.4471,0.2652,1.9446,6.6909,1.7706,1.7876,7.5962,0.091,2.3735,5.4849,4.8321,0.722,3.8005,1.5982,0.0221,2.6672,5.2565,3.7642,7.0521,5.2473,4.1687,0.0078,0.6633,1.6686,8.075,3.5386,6.9074,3.7648,7.5299,2.9392,4.9977,5.1171,1.8825,0.4997,4.9018,0.5974,3.3009,0.7062,2.9161,1.887,1.1101,5.0805,2.733,0.8287,1.8745,8.0677,1.4295,6.6804,2.7431,3.4826,2.6383,3.6844,0.0906,6.4706,2.5945,3.0789,0.163,5.8505,3.9772,1.4581,1.2793,1.7964,5.3067,1.4127,3.2292,3.6303,1.7919,1.3751,1.5075,7.2526,3.009,3.6611,1.0248,6.0296,2.8786,5.3193,0.5686,1.3914,2.7481,4.953,1.6308,0.3247,0.0821,2.5837,0.5423,2.8035,3.7433,2.0009,1.1765,1.3691,1.7639,0.3532,4.4931,2.4065,2.1495,2.6213,2.3941,5.6028,4.5278,0.5121,1.5676,7.7805,0.0455,1.2303,3.0294,4.434,2.571,3.598,4.5117,2.5955,4.3538,1.4883,3.617,2.2533,3.2143,0.1254,1.5708,2.9361,2.934,6.8204,0.2712,1.2907,7.0895,0.0658,0.679,5.2325,0.0131,1.0642,5.1907,8.6329,2.6053,3.5527,2.5602,4.6258,5.9805,1.9402,1.7127,0.1732,2.6653,1.2053,3.9882,2.4319,2.049,4.3733,5.9569,2.461,4.1544,2.2469,2.4043,2.6206,0.577,7.1776,3.4786,1.5423,3.1859,4.3749,0.0368,3.3175,4.1163,0.0066,4.973,0.8259,8.7008,1.2604,2.0451,1.793,5.0318,2.5096,5.5045,1.6915,1.1521,0.1198,0.689,0.8698,1.4948,4.7019,1.8743,1.5226,8.1809,3.0868,5.636,1.8984,0.1248,5.8201,4.7698,3.3136,3.5337,4.8379,4.0188,4.0476,0.0117,4.2537,0.5678,5.7906,1.2343,1.986,5.4752,5.4059,3.1014,4.7512,0.7209,8.6293,3.1859,0.0246,0.0041,5.7187,2.4123,5.6747,5.3395,2.0025,1.2316,5.8047,0.0608,1.6079,5.5402,10.3904,5.1195,0.0092,5.9544,0.4724,3.1985,7.9263,9.2972,3.4181,4.4375,0.7101,1.714,2.7714,2.6541,7.6982,5.1557,0.0803,0.8102,1.7749,3.6955,1.5323,5.9235,2.2622,0.0006,3.1902,0.5464,4.0942,2.2158,1.222,7.1171,4.8613,8.8018,7.4782,4.3305,2.7771,3.6646,2.8454,2.474,1.9355,0.0032,6.0392,2.0494,3.5129,3.7899,4.1761,4.6738,1.8678,2.5003,2.7094,1.2229,2.2064,2.5483,1.8491,5.1147,5.9865,0.5308,3.9895,0.7706,5.1256,0.0252,4.1593,3.736,5.272,0.2217,2.44,1.2592,4.5862,2.0846,4.3723,4.0954,2.0024,3.2369,2.6466,3.4296,3.8611,1.0019,5.1116,0.0004,1.8143,1.9495,5.5128,2.8621,6.7706,5.2269,4.4761,1.9229,2.2448,2.2533,2.8217,2.7399,7.2245,3.6551,0.0039,2.0463,3.086,2.0268,2.6263,7.3872,2.0165,2.4424,3.2028,2.9146,2.6515,0.9189,10.0499,3.7821,2.3567,2.089,5.273,0.2846,0.4471,0.7783,0.069,5.1714,2.1587,0.0002,3.0453,2.2483,3.856,0.0493,0.0561,0.8458,6.0693,3.218,3.427,4.1628,0.9031,2.6438,4.463,0.1983,2.196,4.2361,3.8357,6.0046,1.4384,0.9487,1.9234,1.1231,2.6527,2.8598,0.0668,4.3848,1.3088,1.7933,0.477,2.8071,3.5458,3.8969,2.9005,0.33,0.0034,10.339,1.9511,6.182,0.7136,3.8572,9.9364,4.4655,3.2323,3.3473,1.2265,4.8797,2.8865,1.1414,0.6062,0.5866,1.4016,1.9662,0.5005,2.7403,6.684,5.0293,0.1265,1.2767,0.0013,1.18,0.2107,2.031,2.1382,0.9249,2.4278,3.3576,1.2019,2.6941,7.3736,4.0374,1.1004,2.4672,0.0002,5.8899,0.6051,3.6899,1.7378,2.274,0.2665,2.4404,0.3707,4.5853,7.8773,6.4554,1.0134,2.7967,0.17,0.0009,2.0449,0.8598,7.5662,0.002,1.2905,4.294,2.4093,2.0715,0.7144,6.5758,6.1143,0.3115,0.7429,2.9577,0.0019,1.6322,2.019,3.8211,7.3251,0.0093,6.2313,0.3626,1.5165,2.3721,3.0868,0.9459,3.1404,1.524,4.9217,0.7849,1.5319,2.6923,5.8508,0.0008,5.0916,7.7945,1.8194,5.6654,6.0271,0.2106,1.6791,0.4118,0.1107,1.533,2.8756,2.1262,0.8289,5.8001,0.0392,0.3908,0.4838,2.6197,3.6163,4.215,1.796,3.1451,4.022,2.2531,1.476,0.1083,1.0699,1.0302,0.0002,4.9409,5.5159,1.2057,5.0689,0.1483,1.9754,1.8656,4.3686,3.145,6.3836,2.9557,2.196,0.9793,5.2929,2.0259,2.5204,2.3977,0.6494,2.1327,1.3325,1.7769,1.1603,3.1007,2.8994,3.2849,1.6846,3.516,0.9066,1.1556,1.2873,4.2494,1.4286,4.8845,2.586,0.0697,6.7891,0.4734,0.9681,2.4653,0.9704,1.2495,0.0002,4.4804,1.5286,2.3875,5.8065,0.7403,0.7517,0.8535,0.3822,2.079,2.5031,4.0923,0.1415,0.2562,1.6524]}
{"id":2906,"ended":true,"length":529,"text":"By July 1945 the only elements of the 4th Armoured Brigade in Australia were the unit's headquarters, the 2 \/ 5th and 2 \/ 6th Armoured Regiments and the 2 \/ 1st Armoured Regiment. The 2 \/ 5th had arrived late in March 1945 and was transferred to the 3rd Armoured Brigade, 4th Armoured Division (3rd Armoured Reconnaissance Brigade from late 1942 through 1944) and the 2 \/ 6th arrived towards the end of July 1945. The 2 \/ 1st arrived a little later and was also transferred, in October, to the 3rd Armoured Brigade, 4th and 6th Armoured Divisions.\n\nContents\n\nThe 2 \/ 5th armoured regiment was trained from 25 June 1943 to 28 March 1944 at Camp Bovingdon, in Cambridgeshire. It then moved briefly to Aldershot, UK and then to Shorncliffe, Norfolk before moving to the Warragul range, east of Melbourne.\n\nIt moved to England by ship in August and was deployed to Northern France, participating in the fighting around Eglise, Belgium and the Arnhem area. The 5th and 6th Motor Regiments had joined up with the 2\/5th at Aldershot and the two regiments were deployed to Lille and Antwerp respectively. The battle around Cambrai in France in February 1944 was preceded by an intense artillery barrage and heavy machine gun fire. At the outbreak of the fighting the 3 Regiment (5 and 6) was holding position on the right of the attacking British XVIIa Corps. The Australians had moved to the far right of the British forces, and positioned themselves in a valley a mile (1.6 km) from the centre of the fighting. In the early morning of the 24th, the Australian tanks opened fire, attacking the British armoured train and advancing through the villages. At this stage the 5th Machine Gun Battalion was positioned on the crest of the Cambrai ridge ready to open up with their machine guns on the Allied breakthrough line. The Australian Light Tractor Battalion moved along the left flank of the 5th Regiment into the village of Bapaume and was supported in its advance by the 9th Armoured Regiment.\n\nThe 2\/6th ARR arrived at the Warragul range, in eastern Victoria in July, and took up its positions on the Warragul Plain on 13 July. It moved to the St Kilda area in December, and by the following month it was operating in the southern suburbs of Melbourne.[2]\n\nThe 6th Armoured Battery moved with the Brigade and arrived at Warragul on the 11th of August 1945. The rest of the Regiment followed the following day and it arrived at Ballarat on the 24th of August.[3]\n\nThe 2\/6th RAR was engaged by the Australians defending Lae in late April, as part of the counter-attack that followed this town's capture by the British during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. This battle was part of the larger Allied offensive in New Guinea.","token_len":632,"entropy":[8.4405,8.072,2.8399,7.0599,8.8268,0.4406,0.6713,7.4661,1.1987,4.8808,0.1072,3.5074,3.0043,5.2947,0.7132,3.1215,7.3415,1.1102,5.5428,1.9899,1.8693,4.9498,11.2242,3.6876,1.1308,3.7272,2.1614,0.4239,1.723,0.0014,0.899,0.03,3.433,0.0245,1.9299,0.9952,2.6544,0.6218,3.2595,0.1016,1.9877,0.0019,1.5239,1.0368,1.6457,2.1638,0.2314,1.9883,0.0516,3.8724,5.5412,6.247,1.3703,5.4581,1.0307,1.0436,1.8677,5.4764,0.2835,0.7583,2.5545,0.572,0.4803,0.0027,0.8989,2.0319,5.2741,0.503,0.8466,0.001,2.4974,3.1747,5.1208,0.9217,1.3727,0.0089,5.9572,0.063,2.6709,6.8265,8.4642,3.4747,3.4092,3.4629,2.1136,1.6535,0.7989,1.1099,0.1448,2.3175,0.0007,5.9581,8.8911,0.2781,0.0936,0.0041,3.0365,0.9345,0.268,1.3698,0.9472,0.0546,0.9865,0.002,4.7877,4.3767,1.598,1.1201,1.8564,0.908,4.9634,0.9368,5.3806,3.2107,4.7651,1.0549,0.1756,0.1657,1.3572,0.0311,0.24,0.0021,0.6349,1.3749,0.8312,0.0029,7.3276,3.1641,0.0033,0.0399,0.0097,2.3567,0.0122,0.4624,1.9726,0.0265,6.9886,5.2704,0.0002,2.2285,1.7237,0.1995,0.6717,0.0061,7.2412,1.9155,1.1818,6.2968,3.4315,7.7847,3.7968,2.8499,0.8127,3.5535,3.1202,0.4157,3.4751,4.8555,4.59,9.7915,4.6897,0.9611,3.6326,6.1196,0.3569,0.0001,0.0,0.8221,1.7759,5.4186,1.7089,8.2299,0.3365,8.569,0.2554,0.0287,0.8923,5.689,2.5417,1.6107,0.4563,6.3417,5.5473,2.9035,0.4365,3.7925,4.3342,2.0832,0.4933,2.5145,6.7513,10.8693,7.2751,8.0861,1.7243,5.063,0.1408,5.0235,0.7104,1.4077,0.0002,2.8493,4.0688,0.8188,5.4102,4.2383,6.4699,1.9205,3.0162,3.7292,2.1136,4.7696,0.6231,5.6064,3.642,2.5156,10.3248,0.0808,0.6259,5.311,5.8926,6.693,4.1283,5.6419,1.6367,3.395,1.3002,2.2767,8.3066,0.0051,5.7105,1.0904,2.5553,5.3472,0.0833,3.1883,1.2948,0.0023,9.7546,5.0249,0.0126,3.4933,3.4699,4.7521,0.7605,0.301,1.1988,3.3519,1.4677,0.0275,3.4057,5.2412,0.0088,0.0188,1.6985,3.0806,6.0883,2.0898,0.0075,1.4428,3.7431,0.5377,4.7899,2.2519,2.6114,5.5842,0.0363,0.0049,4.281,0.3378,1.6026,7.6552,5.9682,7.9413,1.2644,0.0005,2.6698,2.3603,2.9476,3.7309,0.6801,1.2206,5.9015,0.0387,2.5447,4.0805,5.3088,2.6722,2.3311,3.6075,3.1538,0.5483,0.4839,1.1624,4.1001,1.6481,5.4754,0.0028,0.3521,3.4045,1.8595,2.8156,7.757,4.1112,3.1552,7.669,0.4897,1.5256,1.8142,9.4125,4.2431,1.9447,0.533,4.2252,2.2799,0.3122,7.6604,4.8607,9.6006,2.2201,6.9988,3.9504,1.2048,1.3073,7.6367,2.0655,3.6276,1.5908,1.3281,5.5334,1.9787,0.5343,0.1107,3.2333,4.6528,2.2104,2.3761,6.5896,0.7368,1.8914,1.8486,5.742,5.9687,4.0832,4.6302,0.4818,0.2795,2.2126,0.4598,0.0097,1.0618,0.2672,3.1178,0.506,0.1747,3.3889,0.5567,3.8601,1.0268,3.1372,1.7148,0.6254,2.4531,2.7694,0.062,1.8195,1.1869,2.5924,6.0462,3.9767,0.0715,2.5185,5.4833,0.8146,2.8231,4.4694,7.4411,2.1754,4.8309,4.3141,0.4121,5.8684,1.8118,3.6544,3.3359,2.597,0.7837,3.266,0.0334,7.448,0.2376,0.4274,2.0143,5.0469,1.7342,0.2792,6.1678,0.1578,0.4108,9.4287,0.0234,0.0097,2.1785,8.9513,0.2478,6.3199,4.2738,5.1073,4.7266,2.716,0.4479,4.253,0.3979,7.685,11.5298,3.4787,0.5048,1.0455,2.5804,7.4942,7.3955,3.0243,0.4534,2.305,3.7721,0.632,3.7087,1.4572,0.5065,0.0629,3.8671,0.0143,4.6295,5.1584,0.5547,2.9893,0.5525,3.3462,10.1742,6.1778,2.1783,3.4781,4.2643,4.5099,2.4502,1.0621,0.0815,1.0838,5.4345,0.2878,2.7441,0.0046,1.1922,1.167,1.7963,0.0001,1.0029,2.0473,1.7354,3.0342,0.0065,10.3469,2.6819,4.8989,1.1972,2.1529,5.8811,0.0114,0.0147,1.1652,2.7359,2.8927,6.0415,4.7134,3.1477,3.4195,3.8303,1.0986,4.7118,2.1445,3.2911,3.5728,1.4834,0.2706,8.2151,0.0177,0.0541,7.1235,3.4138,4.8476,1.6072,0.5878,1.6765,1.8463,0.8725,1.5653,7.2577,4.6393,0.0067,3.2421,2.1917,4.1743,2.1371,1.0718,5.3411,1.551,3.558,1.6285,1.6985,1.1004,5.3701,1.1783,0.8061,4.9999,4.3667,0.2211,2.5853,7.6964,2.6963,0.0572,0.7728,0.0001,1.4847,3.9414,0.0378,0.8315,0.0031,7.5689,2.4835,5.0731,0.8261,6.9157,3.4762,4.9569,0.8857,5.4448,0.0083,0.0087,1.0274,3.2519,4.2558,0.1669,1.2779,1.6882,2.7363,0.5797,1.4935,6.6604,0.0374,0.1538,4.7571,4.5825,2.3113,6.848,0.7205,2.1487,4.5454,3.5732,0.7317,7.0802,0.5437,1.3373,0.9207,3.8239,0.0078,1.3416,2.0286,2.7232,0.3517,0.0513,0.503,0.0001,1.0381,1.2928,1.1614,0.5372,0.0041,6.9698,6.7356,1.8847,5.1315,1.7997,0.6185,5.3023,7.7891,4.1981,9.1415,3.467,4.4267,2.5573,2.2735,4.3759,1.632,0.0009,0.9589,5.208,0.5131,1.0538,5.0163,2.5964,6.6784,8.1679,1.6754,2.5125,1.4946,0.3098,1.6692,4.5726,0.284,1.3715,0.0084,2.5724,3.3962,6.1502,0.0378,0.0003,4.6562,0.6436,3.7315,3.0953,1.2336,4.8235,0.0025,0.8225,4.9323,3.3523,1.3575,2.1904,6.1352,1.0623,1.9142]}
{"id":860,"ended":true,"length":519,"text":"Roman conspiracy : John < unk > accuse Gallienus of the assassination. An interesting passage in the work of the Anonymus post Dionem speaks of a certain `` Rufinus `` who orchestrated the assassination of Pompeius, the Roman general who defeated Pompey in the Battle of Pharsalus, and who was the leader, along with a certain `` Vigilius,`` of the ``conspiracy of the praetorian prefects.`` According to the anonymous author, Rufinus instigated the assassins to assassinate Pompeius, and he acted as one of their couriers. This passage, if genuine and not an interpolation, strongly indicates that Rufinus was a prefect of the Praetorian Guard, i.e., that he had connections in the imperial administration.\n\nAnother work to read to see how they were viewed is The Roman Conspiracy of Cestius Gallus. The most relevant passage to discuss here comes near the end of Chapter 7:\n\nThus the plot by the praetorian prefects was revealed, which would have been followed by the destruction of the Gallian Empire if they should have succeeded in it. As for the conspirators, only Cestius Gallus, the prefect of the legions in the East, escaped without injury to his person. But this Cestius, though he was in fear for his life, nevertheless had an accomplice, a certain Titus Quinctius, who gave him warning in time of the approaching danger and betrayed himself to him by word of mouth. Titus Quinctius was also an accomplice of Cestius, but Cestius at first made use of him in his own interests, and by means of him he escaped from the prefects by the way of the east gate.\n\nThis passage is interesting insofar as it establishes that Quinctius was a person of some standing. Though the author of the De Administrando Imperio does not name him, it is safe to assume that this was Titus Quinctius Sabinus, who was a senator, a prefect of the praetorian prefecture, and a candidate for governor of Syria.\n\nQuinctius escaped safely to Rome where he committed suicide, most likely during the reign of Domitian. Thus, if any conspiracy would have been successful, it would have been organized by the Praetorian prefects, but only Sabinus escaped to Rome and committed suicide.\n\nAn anecdote related by Gaius Plinius Secundus of this conspiracy is very interesting. When in a meeting of the emperor Trajan and some of his most influential military officers, the officers presented a report of several men, which the latter rejected. The reason that Trajan refused the information concerned the assassination of Pompey, the Roman general who had defeated Pompey in the Battle of Pharsalus, a victory which the author of De Administrando Imperio suggests that this same Titus Quinctius Sabinus may have been involved in. This meeting was a sign of political tension in the Roman Empire at the time.","token_len":632,"entropy":[10.8223,8.2226,6.8934,10.8291,11.3378,4.2267,6.5285,12.4656,10.81,4.9858,3.9608,0.6517,4.1822,4.4601,2.8354,6.0564,4.9332,5.8275,1.9417,1.2085,5.8852,2.345,2.7009,7.6821,6.129,0.2241,9.7644,14.3877,6.9267,16.2475,0.2837,2.3007,4.1843,10.5274,11.399,3.42,2.0284,4.2646,1.3793,8.3681,0.6052,1.7529,0.4817,7.9239,3.3827,2.1849,2.6912,3.2444,2.2847,1.1879,5.0327,2.8156,0.53,1.67,1.3796,2.7589,0.0114,4.419,2.5524,1.5172,1.6302,0.9633,0.8293,1.7652,2.8974,3.7221,5.8352,3.9695,0.0073,3.1178,2.5015,5.0316,5.0287,4.7789,0.694,0.1646,6.1628,5.8113,1.0673,1.1295,3.5415,7.25,0.5764,1.6319,1.2263,7.8806,0.1104,0.906,7.6068,0.9317,0.8096,3.9231,8.6868,4.7193,0.0042,1.5061,5.0229,2.1127,0.8079,2.9875,0.0024,0.0068,8.743,0.0237,0.5728,5.519,1.4953,3.3699,2.4784,3.6614,1.352,1.5559,2.5824,6.3959,0.8341,4.3608,0.1812,3.4936,6.623,0.0342,0.6776,3.3096,4.9191,3.006,4.6088,5.2516,4.589,2.859,3.3422,3.4605,0.0137,0.6517,7.4512,2.968,0.4116,1.6238,0.0027,0.0024,0.839,2.1282,5.1788,0.1073,0.6866,0.6686,2.8198,0.0021,0.1543,3.3827,1.3748,5.7812,0.0043,0.0443,0.3537,1.9878,0.7711,2.7887,5.7073,3.2242,0.9776,4.9045,2.5953,1.448,2.6956,0.0675,4.7931,6.0915,5.6085,6.4061,5.1855,4.6819,2.7021,4.9618,2.2658,8.8655,2.3781,4.6203,4.7399,3.5356,2.3226,5.949,4.5673,0.5983,6.0085,2.7408,1.4104,2.0275,5.0022,5.6374,1.5165,3.1376,5.5017,2.8071,4.3073,7.4546,0.0451,0.1677,0.1029,3.718,3.1899,2.7048,1.1871,0.0002,6.6187,2.5924,5.9051,4.7831,1.6087,3.3774,0.0111,0.3309,1.1314,0.0146,0.1751,2.3657,5.3603,1.9317,3.7454,4.9552,1.5591,1.2116,5.5483,0.3953,0.8714,5.3004,0.0871,0.8824,6.3449,1.3426,2.9968,5.0496,3.1409,5.3851,1.6589,2.5873,0.7249,4.3981,0.3819,4.3024,1.7569,0.5542,2.3617,0.137,0.5818,5.4922,5.0469,0.0787,0.0149,0.7958,0.1157,1.5828,2.0262,3.1631,0.0081,0.3921,0.2841,5.437,4.2005,1.6149,4.9961,0.3094,5.5184,4.8211,4.3515,2.266,1.006,5.1456,1.2983,3.5066,3.8314,6.2374,0.0084,0.0805,2.2567,4.4805,1.7648,1.1902,3.7274,6.1587,2.6371,0.0618,0.1116,0.2435,2.9067,4.288,3.6769,4.2576,0.016,1.3838,2.267,2.6641,7.4299,5.7438,2.4791,0.5405,0.5137,0.4347,4.7564,0.6199,8.0132,3.2525,4.887,0.8764,2.461,4.4646,3.8009,3.1496,6.633,4.5924,1.0276,1.988,2.3935,9.0193,0.5696,0.9028,0.3327,3.5736,0.8566,0.0065,0.0118,1.5706,3.8466,3.4968,1.8711,0.0013,0.9038,2.4687,0.0029,0.0043,2.9851,3.2654,4.6489,0.0038,0.0011,6.976,2.3892,4.762,3.892,0.0055,1.5373,2.6785,1.8523,2.4712,5.1265,1.0718,1.0625,4.237,2.9319,0.0429,3.2912,1.1252,5.462,1.7611,0.9922,7.2586,0.1998,1.0537,3.611,2.902,3.2336,0.0657,1.4905,6.4219,6.2923,0.8924,2.1817,0.0003,2.8234,1.1081,1.3956,3.4507,6.2349,0.0532,0.1957,5.2945,1.1961,3.3098,0.0117,0.0146,0.846,1.5452,4.8162,1.3247,3.8686,6.8219,2.0602,5.9674,2.5291,2.1811,2.6003,1.2435,6.3377,11.5586,8.3641,3.2894,8.3811,2.303,3.1829,0.1355,4.3997,1.6877,0.7632,1.6792,0.684,5.9091,0.0101,0.8311,0.1624,3.1554,2.1581,6.4312,0.3508,0.0035,0.0195,9.1976,4.3365,1.2248,0.8517,1.3174,1.1254,2.0197,4.451,2.9437,2.4749,4.4469,0.0058,1.3547,0.1344,4.0361,0.0049,0.149,2.3202,1.7389,0.8866,0.4066,1.606,6.0441,0.3453,4.8421,0.6646,5.235,0.5364,2.0589,0.0001,4.9599,0.0444,0.0226,5.6798,7.0765,1.7341,1.6565,4.4569,0.1675,5.4114,0.8051,2.0591,7.0124,0.4859,4.4154,1.0569,3.9583,0.0347,5.2919,0.047,0.1416,1.3802,5.5669,1.4153,3.1973,5.0752,3.8166,4.4737,0.6274,0.7719,5.4456,0.76,1.0122,0.7409,0.5295,0.6525,8.2513,0.6548,2.1544,2.833,0.0033,0.1085,2.601,0.0678,0.0862,1.3037,3.328,4.3236,6.1158,0.0008,0.1316,3.0532,2.9647,1.2644,2.7925,2.4814,0.0298,0.6019,1.3317,0.0001,5.373,7.188,5.1706,0.4963,5.3844,2.7464,0.0089,4.1454,4.9638,0.2154,9.5162,0.4573,0.2788,4.056,5.8344,3.8049,1.1664,4.5856,0.9596,0.662,3.8593,5.4091,3.3388,2.8366,1.35,0.4737,4.9294,5.7376,0.0109,3.4897,3.8794,0.7583,0.4634,5.5934,3.4688,4.4911,1.0924,0.9552,2.3009,6.6095,5.6757,1.8419,3.2686,1.3465,5.906,4.9202,3.4384,3.7111,2.5078,6.0079,6.4817,1.5827,1.5765,5.6269,3.632,3.4106,0.0005,3.4281,3.1421,5.1533,7.8953,1.0854,6.1591,0.1658,2.0169,0.1677,1.0286,2.8583,4.806,0.5044,0.7115,1.2346,2.9187,0.4613,0.0023,1.2879,0.2546,0.2799,0.0085,0.467,0.0162,0.0144,1.2737,4.5342,5.8372,1.2817,2.762,6.5772,0.8636,3.8606,0.203,0.0144,0.0058,0.275,0.0012,4.1422,3.8937,3.6841,5.584,9.6171,0.3139,0.0309,0.0122,1.5118,0.0007,0.0134,3.9087,0.0951,1.879,1.7063,0.3206,0.5603,3.0064,7.5776,1.4757,3.9527,5.0311,0.6129,7.1302,5.0601,2.1459,0.9293,2.1237,0.7953,4.4716,0.6246,0.0928,1.148]}

In 1971, Lennon and Ono released their \u201d Double Fantasy\u201d album and the album\u2019s title track, which was one of its two singles, was written about the birth of Lennon and Ono\u2019s son, Sean Lennon. The second single, which received a similar treatment was \"All Things Must Pass \u201d, which was released in the U.K. on 9th November 1971.\n\nA few years after this period in which Pang worked as an assistant and Sean was born, Pang would go on to become a photographer.","token_len":632,"entropy":[6.0124,8.9022,10.6095,1.9368,8.8408,0.5666,4.8334,2.0773,6.8741,7.3476,5.2619,2.0895,5.8457,0.4398,2.9544,12.3015,0.3675,0.1016,7.9942,1.1957,9.6451,9.2941,7.0092,4.4157,2.6556,1.5916,8.561,0.0083,2.8053,3.8873,0.7345,6.7171,9.126,1.302,3.7042,6.6359,3.1634,1.8244,0.0181,0.0038,1.0706,9.1898,4.3686,3.6876,0.0059,1.8762,1.0061,2.4545,3.7284,0.7409,1.9078,1.8923,2.198,1.825,4.1349,6.8036,2.624,3.9282,6.2465,1.8883,2.8487,1.1148,3.7357,0.0009,4.8584,6.6937,5.1806,13.5114,8.171,5.7298,7.9234,4.9594,6.7632,3.8835,1.1294,1.9093,8.3418,0.0472,2.2305,0.3253,7.6604,1.1715,1.515,2.774,0.4589,2.0663,6.1624,1.4379,12.8786,7.6019,1.9529,0.9773,0.6981,2.9418,0.2427,3.4332,4.6,4.8533,1.4898,2.9675,6.4208,2.9847,0.0028,2.3514,2.2345,4.0424,2.5036,0.2401,2.2716,6.0302,1.4841,0.004,2.3791,4.5694,5.918,0.0214,1.5068,7.5571,2.7294,1.1041,5.1985,0.6179,4.5224,0.0579,4.8183,2.3519,1.7113,1.5774,2.1538,0.9436,1.7777,2.0104,0.0013,2.0788,6.0116,1.0167,5.0034,1.6835,1.0561,7.3327,1.5425,1.3607,5.4607,0.1724,1.7993,1.7987,3.4577,1.0391,2.6901,7.1677,0.4027,3.4731,2.5045,5.0278,3.1182,9.5307,2.7615,6.3873,0.5407,0.0046,0.5307,5.6315,0.3843,4.8274,6.3091,5.6002,5.3743,2.2001,7.3895,0.8545,2.2097,1.482,0.2365,9.7153,4.0704,9.9272,4.0245,8.1217,0.5624,3.4047,4.6475,3.6107,2.8592,1.1508,0.3863,3.1884,0.5566,3.052,8.0252,1.8498,2.6466,6.1373,0.0278,2.6041,0.0004,2.8542,5.7504,3.5024,3.5152,0.412,0.739,0.6042,3.5915,1.5118,5.5187,6.9936,3.2958,1.5874,1.4967,3.6314,9.4363,3.8464,11.8044,4.4978,11.2035,2.1469,2.8601,3.719,6.2146,0.0042,7.0115,1.8343,9.4724,4.8726,3.7078,2.8897,3.3095,0.8181,0.8395,0.0002,3.3913,0.0075,0.0004,2.0054,1.3712,0.0004,1.6011,0.0013,3.2362,7.8183,0.0017,1.5942,2.87,0.0277,2.1531,1.3528,3.1522,0.2298,2.7383,6.5692,0.0048,6.7767,1.1322,3.9057,1.783,2.0055,3.6338,1.3293,6.5561,2.3701,3.6642,1.2663,0.2609,0.0017,3.0523,3.7807,1.0454,1.8802,0.0024,5.5534,2.1265,1.2461,3.7935,3.1587,0.0002,1.3477,3.416,7.9136,0.0054,0.735,0.1169,0.0318,1.2077,0.33,0.451,7.4099,5.0532,0.4117,0.3598,0.445,0.0184,0.0226,0.3609,0.0008,0.001,0.0047,0.0395,0.0068,0.1468,0.0289,0.0429,0.0959,0.3263,0.0808,0.1859,0.0258,0.0232,0.0014,0.001,0.0052,0.0016,0.0058,4.4847,0.2669,4.8573,0.6053,0.8186,0.0002,5.2027,5.3602,0.5931,0.3112,6.9947,0.0016,2.8839,0.7611,6.915,1.9256,0.5435,0.1549,2.798,4.798,3.1474,1.4457,4.9736,2.2891,7.7419,2.0739,0.8138,7.006,0.1096,1.9025,2.805,6.7909,1.7925,2.1995,3.8716,0.1111,0.8003,2.9865,0.2936,1.4998,7.2011,1.1474,0.6224,4.7441,4.0999,0.995,0.0335,0.0009,0.2168,7.1395,2.8365,6.4929,3.8886,2.1299,0.0017,5.1198,3.2815,6.5225,2.1046,8.4215,7.4214,1.1476,8.0241,1.8351,3.695,1.962,2.0874,0.0021,2.0257,0.2571,4.6843,4.2423,8.1234,2.6654,4.5922,0.4684,1.9325,1.477,0.9986,3.9438,4.2315,5.1313,1.8815,5.1562,5.0572,0.927,0.0004,5.4932,1.5312,5.7034,5.454,0.0023,4.0018,4.1355,0.9141,1.4893,1.5248,4.6522,1.5038,3.7415,2.8083,1.879,1.3759,3.4098,6.1333,2.012,0.6244,4.1084,0.4424,0.9649,2.2387,0.1538,0.71,0.0002,4.0003,0.0196,7.0049,1.0187,1.8134,5.2928,2.0324,2.0504,1.4149,0.0611,2.1871,2.8681,6.5772,3.4853,3.7817,5.0702,2.9518,0.5199,0.1187,0.8402,3.7693,3.1445,1.2407,3.6513,3.2344,0.2954,6.1267,1.6656,0.9196,0.5827,4.701,0.7752,1.9911,0.0003,3.0055,6.5265,1.3365,4.1621,1.6752,0.1118,1.9311,1.7373,2.3086,0.0028,5.8555,8.2702,2.9947,3.4531,3.6766,6.3957,2.1036,3.2964,2.9747,6.1953,0.1062,4.4457,4.6336,6.0833,3.3734,3.247,1.469,5.7619,1.8034,1.2246,10.1443,1.2238,0.264,0.3944,1.5778,3.5839,7.5584,0.0664,7.1073,7.1741,1.6314,0.9377,2.0906,4.6408,2.419,3.5743,1.6521,4.8632,2.1295,1.1396,5.9348,0.4022,0.9605,3.9912,0.1275,0.6463,2.9909,3.1564,0.1304,1.3399,2.0614,0.4795,0.0025,5.2936,1.2118,10.893,2.651,11.8116,7.87,1.251,1.5331,2.0863,2.5298,2.5746,1.543,6.5087,2.8471,2.1517,4.517,0.6303,1.0754,1.6204,1.6015,4.6812,0.0365,5.6736,6.3021,3.0511,1.5265,4.8778,5.237,6.2053,2.5237,5.5766,0.1196,2.1283,1.3134,0.9022,0.003,5.2226,0.7709,1.7618,1.4046,1.1711,1.5627,3.8753,0.5485,2.2921,4.592,1.5712,0.4289,2.2231,6.0716,1.8467,6.8248,1.0364,3.8334,2.3642,5.3377,5.0419,1.9823,0.2445,5.5795,1.2846,3.718,1.0158,1.1723,1.775,1.6358,2.2278,0.5709,0.0011,0.7333,0.1081,0.4935,4.5915,1.137,2.7785,1.2492,0.5829,1.6703,0.0002,4.4125,2.174,1.8688,2.0382,2.2812,7.273,3.0487,2.1734,4.2397,0.0041,2.695,1.5564,1.3785,0.1557,2.9417,7.4551,2.5276,4.3189,0.2298,3.2385,0.006,3.96,3.0889,0.251,0.0269,1.8233,0.9911,5.5775,2.0237]}
{"id":3309,"ended":true,"length":515,"text":"The current concept of Oryzomys derives from the palustris @ - @ mexicanus group recognized within a much larger genus Oryzomys by Merriam ( 1901 ) and the palustris group proposed by Goldman ( 1918 ). The main character distinguishing the palustriids from other mammals ( rodents and primates ) is the presence of the premolars and incisors ( molars ) formed by one single bone, as well as the presence of a canine-like tooth ( rostrum ). A number of anatomical characters within the palustriids differ from those of other rodents ( e.g. dentition and osteology ) and also from those of primates ( e.g. fur and face ) - although only a number of features (e.g. the fur of the coat and certain facial features) differ from those of apes. This raises the question of how the palustriids are similar to other mammals. Most researchers have recognized the palustriids to be more closely related to primates than to rodents.\n\nIn general, most rodents have both a molar and incisor. The molar is normally the smallest tooth that forms, with the exception of the canid or canine. The incisors develop and become functional in the fattening of the meat, as food is digested; however, this is only the case for incisors as opposed to canines. All rodents, except the palustrians, have a canine tooth at the maxilla. The canine is present and develops as long as the molar and incisors are present but also only after the other teeth have gone through the growth cycle. Palustrians and primates both have a premolar formed by the same bone. The mandibular premolars are also the smallest of the molar teeth in most rodents. They also differ in size and shape from the rest of the molars. Palustrians and primates have all four molars and their premolars formed by the same bone, but the mandibular premolars of the latter are the smallest molars.\n\nPalustrinids are the only true rodents in which all the molars are formed by the same bone. Other rodents, such as the rat ( Rattus ) and most other rodents of the subfamily Castorinae, have dentary molars (the molars of the lower jaw), which are normally smaller than the upper molars. However, some rodents such as the Japanese mole ( Alectoris ) and the giant kangaroo rat or komodo dragon ( Varanus giganteus ), while still having dentary molars, do not develop canine-like teeth. This is because the canine and incisors normally disappear in the same developmental stage that the molars do (see below ). These animals instead develop a toothless canine tooth, which is usually only present on the premolars and incisors, which are also very bony.

{"id":2353,"ended":true,"length":479,"text":"Bacteria often function as multicellular aggregates known as biofilms, exchanging a variety of molecular signals for inter @ - @ cell communication, and engaging in coordinated multicellular behavior. The communal benefits of these associations are, in part, realized through the production of a variety of bioactive polymers, such as polysaccharides, amino acids, and peptides, by biofilm-associated cells through de novo synthesis (i.e., biosynthesis from carbon sources other than food), and degradation from the polymeric biomass (i.e., biosynthesis from food sources) into soluble components. Because biofilms play such an important role in bio-energy and bioindustrial production, there is an increase in efforts to elucidate the cell surface glycoproteins and their function in biofilm assembly. Biofilm cell surface glycan composition has previously been characterized on a population-level scale, using molecular methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and isoelectric focusing (IEF) to characterize the distribution of sugars in biofilm cell surfaces. IEF can also be used to characterize the distribution of non-protein, or extracellular matrix components, such as fucose, fucosylated glycoproteins, laminin, cellulose, laminarin, heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), and glycolipids. The use of this technique to characterize carbohydrate\/lipid composition of biofilms is known as \u201ccarbohydrate enrichment\u201d.\nCarbohydrate enrichment in biofilms may be important in biofilm formation and bioreactor maintenance (such as in the case of biofouling in bioenergy and bioproduct bioreactors), particularly where cells interact actively with surrounding media, and where growth media changes are relatively infrequent (such as during batch bioenergy production). While there are several published articles describing the use of IEF to determine the composition and distribution of glycan moieties present in microbial cell surfaces, none of these studies provide quantitative data regarding glycan content in biofilm cell surfaces as measured by the ratio of carbohydrate vs. non-carbohydrate moieties. Also, most of the studies do not provide information regarding the amount of carbohydrate vs. protein in the same cell surface, and typically focus on the amount of carbohydrate alone. One study used IEF with cell cultures to study the level of laminin in the extracellular matrix of a strain of Pseudomonas sp. This work showed that laminin was present in P. aeruginosa biofilms in concentrations below detectable levels for most electrophoretic techniques studied. An article describing the use of IEF to obtain the distribution of glycoproteins in the extracellular matrix of three bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, and Geobacter sp.) noted that this technique was useful in determining the distribution of non-membrane glyoproteins. But, this work did not provide any data about the amount of carbohydrate present.","token_len":635,"entropy":[10.8444,7.6534,7.5702,1.0324,7.6437,0.3459,0.0035,6.0193,0.0523,6.4266,0.1959,5.2743,0.6247,0.0167,1.4818,9.3193,4.8188,2.3116,0.0011,4.9617,3.1427,2.4843,6.8277,16.1226,5.521,4.8291,7.9378,2.4648,2.4769,2.3237,7.4027,0.3869,5.7231,6.2491,0.3377,0.0216,4.8316,0.6762,2.4398,11.9933,8.4149,0.3245,2.6993,6.7019,0.9891,5.6069,1.6742,0.8058,0.0023,6.2993,1.1145,1.1063,4.737,0.1369,3.2197,2.4826,0.0033,3.1151,3.6925,6.0533,0.6901,1.2748,2.3454,0.0052,2.572,2.9917,0.0033,0.0868,0.8052,6.1404,0.1426,0.2031,0.6948,4.1965,0.0235,1.4596,5.5761,6.1546,2.6519,2.004,4.9753,4.0926,6.5023,6.4146,1.9864,0.0005,2.2993,3.5415,4.5607,0.0414,0.0004,0.0954,5.4399,1.0791,5.472,6.6161,6.7681,7.0046,0.0047,3.7086,3.2102,1.7835,6.4905,4.3212,2.5195,5.2285,3.2069,5.2117,2.4966,0.6758,0.0005,0.0005,0.0311,4.2121,0.2467,0.5346,2.8506,2.6371,4.6981,3.5742,6.589,5.2334,1.9578,5.5222,1.5551,1.6656,0.0028,4.7578,2.9005,1.9276,0.1301,0.0763,0.0735,3.5214,2.3099,4.3534,3.0186,1.7081,7.689,2.5487,0.28,3.5861,0.6046,2.5988,5.0842,0.0769,7.0386,0.3941,6.3105,0.006,0.7306,7.4773,5.0864,8.2834,2.1327,0.5012,0.013,1.5769,1.8651,3.8051,0.7287,1.682,1.8769,5.6678,0.7975,4.9796,0.6666,6.073,1.36,0.3887,6.6016,4.6752,2.3157,4.4318,0.0597,4.293,5.0691,1.6475,5.9641,0.6606,1.59,3.0954,1.8182,3.2933,4.4895,3.0779,2.7485,0.0012,6.1384,2.3621,0.0675,0.0553,0.0471,2.4995,0.041,0.0132,0.0067,0.0012,1.0745,2.8612,0.0443,0.9042,0.8779,7.2356,4.5854,0.0088,0.5583,11.1482,1.894,4.3399,1.1121,0.9168,2.6587,1.9582,0.9028,5.122,0.2782,8.1523,1.3439,1.9621,0.4404,2.5607,1.3247,0.5562,7.2746,1.4734,4.8945,1.8418,0.7708,0.5065,0.2562,1.4183,0.6326,4.0365,0.053,5.0194,0.66,3.4709,3.6752,4.1964,6.8036,0.0312,0.0001,6.2811,4.2034,1.7803,1.0987,0.0019,7.0226,5.3503,1.1979,1.0342,4.9034,1.7576,1.5344,1.1239,1.8512,3.5481,1.303,0.0842,0.0068,0.3335,5.7547,6.2498,1.0278,0.3199,5.6297,0.0459,0.2081,4.8577,3.618,9.9762,0.1926,7.9323,3.2787,0.0545,8.511,0.2406,8.0656,1.968,0.9826,2.6052,2.1254,2.0979,2.7493,0.444,0.7694,3.4085,3.1451,2.5227,1.277,1.2541,2.3194,3.8887,0.0049,3.8439,2.723,1.4355,1.0562,8.3658,4.9461,4.9096,0.5972,3.73,2.2144,0.4765,0.7008,0.0033,2.1027,6.5707,0.9859,11.2636,8.9854,7.9284,0.2796,7.5345,2.0239,7.3105,1.4558,3.1912,15.8411,0.1455,0.2781,1.5561,3.2266,0.5978,0.3736,0.0017,4.5616,1.0379,4.9729,1.3892,4.2562,2.6423,1.9273,2.0254,5.551,3.0424,0.9645,4.5787,3.2976,7.3747,0.0075,2.0187,1.634,3.6957,0.0065,2.2545,5.1066,3.6884,0.304,4.1199,2.9036,9.9327,3.1782,2.7342,3.4285,0.918,0.8817,5.9365,1.4963,1.2185,0.2958,1.5856,4.5174,4.1949,5.937,5.5934,7.155,0.5923,7.4719,6.1958,1.8577,2.4188,1.3515,6.1667,6.2811,7.3363,3.6041,6.2125,5.7226,0.1321,1.6612,3.1479,0.0045,4.2717,10.0543,7.1326,3.7772,1.5375,0.5691,5.1913,3.0461,0.985,2.3544,5.9355,5.8085,2.0036,0.7346,4.3639,0.0163,6.1989,0.1883,1.4518,3.6287,0.5746,2.9273,2.347,2.4056,0.0123,3.5682,2.6437,9.2224,0.0611,7.0924,0.0967,7.4596,4.2764,0.481,0.3835,3.0877,1.6074,0.3844,1.1022,4.4247,3.8536,1.4518,2.961,3.1509,0.6948,4.0599,1.2457,0.4159,1.7165,3.1327,0.2349,4.7729,4.5373,0.3556,2.3535,4.2843,0.1101,3.8289,6.4199,0.2128,3.6788,0.1314,1.1062,0.0441,2.5699,0.1193,1.0846,6.497,0.0611,3.8084,1.0131,0.3194,1.0411,4.4004,0.0041,1.9042,3.5159,1.5844,0.6025,4.1622,0.1275,1.9012,6.6959,0.0042,4.6854,1.4039,1.5543,5.2891,2.7121,1.1662,1.4842,1.6655,7.2193,3.8495,0.1508,0.9668,2.6532,0.0932,1.636,5.857,1.2374,4.568,2.5424,3.9857,2.1183,0.0887,5.0888,5.2909,4.1756,1.5039,3.8073,0.3607,5.8233,0.0966,6.3291,2.0046,0.1004,1.2821,1.735,6.8443,0.001,0.0002,0.1261,1.2929,1.9741,5.626,0.2982,3.5877,0.0038,0.037,0.0022,5.6541,0.2056,6.3631,5.2449,3.3547,0.2082,2.7034,0.0048,0.016,1.5956,2.462,0.3077,8.2419,1.2813,3.3035,0.0045,0.0189,0.0063,3.5585,0.4656,0.0204,3.1557,4.5733,4.2866,8.1732,0.8756,2.2985,4.381,11.647,0.0486,3.1617,0.1361,5.5486,8.2771,1.1514,5.2496,3.946,2.9283,0.6275,2.412,0.0025,0.7562,0.0108,1.1299,5.2441,1.6952,4.7662,0.0723,1.981,2.29,0.0634,0.0034,0.7636,2.7193,0.9638,0.001,0.0,0.0348,0.3114,6.2323,5.1135,2.116,6.9211,0.0215,0.3229,0.0054,5.3689,0.0596,0.3247,3.4796,0.0001,0.0005,0.0004,0.0086,0.5794,0.115,11.5751,2.5343,0.055,6.4309,1.0135,5.1286,0.2699,3.6118,4.2144,1.8444,4.09,1.0165,2.4556,0.3402,3.1904,0.0454,3.321,0.106,7.4473,0.1336,0.011,1.5535,8.6206,0.0212,0.0058,2.3778,6.393,1.3259,3.0377,2.3126,1.8363,0.009,1.5005,3.3372,2.5778,2.1299,0.3358,2.1546,0.0719,2.7416,2.5568,4.0399]}
{"id":3358,"ended":false,"length":536,"text":"Upon the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Majestic and the rest of the 7th Battle Squadron were assigned to the Channel Fleet. Majestic underwent a refit in August and September, spending time on the Thames between Greenwich and Chatham. She received three months of refit leave in 1915. She then returned to the Channel Fleet off Dover on 4 December, and was present as a \"war ship of the line\" for the annual Christmas visit of the Duke and Duchess of Norfolk. Majestic sailed for America via the canal zone, reaching St. Helena early in 1917.\n\nMajestic and five other cruisers of Squadron B returned to England in early April 1918. They participated in the Channel Fleet\u2019s attempt to support General Haig\u2019s operations against General Ludendorff to relieve pressure upon him in the Ruhr. Majestic, her old friend U.S.S. Neshoba, and the cruisers USS Yorktown and U.S.S. Atlanta were assigned to sweep the Kaiser Wilhelm canal area and the approaches to the Elbe. She escorted the destroyers that escorted the troopships that were used to land reinforcements and supplies. On 9 April, she joined the screening force that included the cruisers U.S.S. Lexington, U.S.S. Yorktown, and U.S.S. Atlanta. When their ships were attacked by German aircraft at 0745, the screening forces withdrew to their ships. The group was then attacked by German small vessels and small airplanes. All the five screening cruisers were hit, and Majestic sustained four dead and 23 wounded. She participated in the attempt to sweep the Kaiser Wilhelm canal between 14 and 24 April. Majestic was involved in the bombardment of the Doberan bridge complex on 17 April, and had some of her men stationed aboard two U.S. Army troopships under fire until 0630 the next day. She then escorted U.S. Army personnel to the area around Wunstorf for reassignment to other naval forces. She then took part in the operation to sweep the approaches to the Elbe, and sailed for North America 10 May. Majestic arrived at Halifax on 16 June, and was paid off. She departed Halifax for Portland, Maine, on 17 June. The destroyer escort USS St. Elmo was torpedoed and sunk during exercise off St. Marys Bay, Georgia, 28 June and 6 July. Majestic arrived back at San Francisco, California, on 3 November and was decommissioned on 16 November 1918.

{"id":605,"ended":true,"length":513,"text":"The poem's seventy lines of blank verse are presented as a dramatic monologue. Scholars disagree on how Ulysses'speech functions in this format ; it is not necessarily clear to whom Ulysses is speaking, and the poem contains numerous references to Ulysses that can apply to any of the characters in the story, particularly Odysseus. There are references to the character of Telemachus, Ulysses' son, and possibly to the character of \u00c6sop, the ape-man. Scholars who believe that Ulysses' speech consists of dialogue agree that the poem has three main sections and that it contains four different voices.\n\nSome commentators consider Ulysses' speech to be an elegy on mortality. A literary critic wrote that in Ulysses'final address as he prepares to die he may be making some allusion to the death of a son. Ulysses'death is foreshadowed in the events that precede his speech in the first person ; the cyclops is in Odysseus'thoughts, and the ghost of Hector appears. Ulysses' statement to his son regarding the Trojan War parallels lines by Homer:\n\nOdysseus and I have reached our fates ;\nWe are in the hands of fate :\nWe cannot help the turning up,\nOf which I have told thee more... (line 2\u201414).\n\nThe first section of the poem consists of Ulysses' account of being blinded when he was struck by a spear and being taken prisoner by the Achaeans of Troy. The second section recounts the events of the Trojan War, and consists of Ulysses' speech to the Trojan heroes. The third section consists of Ulysses' account of his escape from Troy following Athena's intervention.\n\nThere are also poems in which Ulysses does not speak to his shipmates. These poems are written in the third person narrative about the events of the return to Ithaca. One of these poems, for example, describes Odysseus'feelings when Ulysses and the other prisoners are being transported back to Ithaca. This poem contains a number of allusions to Homeric poetry. Also, some of the poems written to Ulysses by the prisoners contain allusions to the stories in Homer's Odyssey and to stories in the Iliad.\n\nAt least one of the stories in Ulysses is an allusion to the Trojan War itself. In a short story titled \"Eumaeus and the Cyclops,\" a blind seer tells Eumaeus that the Cyclops is in Odysseus'thoughts. Eumaeus asks the Cyclops which of the many stories he is reading is his favorite; the blind man says that \"there is a story that he always likes most \" ; he then goes on to tell Eumaeus that the story concerns Ulysses. However, the blind man does not describe what the story is in which Eumaeus's blind father is abducted by Achilles, nor does he name the heroes in the story.","token_len":636,"entropy":[11.2215,3.3888,10.5963,3.7392,2.9254,8.7379,2.4616,1.6589,7.034,1.6927,1.7267,7.4067,5.9625,0.088,2.138,9.0309,4.9142,1.5489,2.2924,10.3131,1.4646,0.0,3.7604,16.5832,2.4407,9.1226,1.4557,2.3498,7.1339,10.2683,2.507,1.2967,2.8205,5.2533,2.7152,2.9944,3.4353,2.2922,0.0013,0.0005,2.0246,2.6951,1.5127,1.7434,2.4548,2.3722,4.7702,4.2577,2.6132,0.0867,2.8213,0.0025,0.0052,5.645,4.3173,8.2311,0.1805,2.1447,2.2249,0.6853,2.872,1.2504,0.5702,2.9748,2.1313,4.9414,9.2823,0.056,0.0011,0.0024,1.3955,4.3121,0.6899,4.5224,0.2233,2.182,5.1436,1.9372,7.6578,1.0972,0.0006,1.1099,5.1249,0.0066,0.0032,1.6469,3.0193,0.7793,1.9468,6.6077,2.8829,1.8358,3.5023,0.0755,8.6085,0.0853,2.9332,6.3015,1.0396,1.5599,8.9346,1.3204,1.7401,2.0503,5.6712,5.3093,3.7698,0.7993,0.588,0.0002,0.0004,2.6427,2.5778,5.0127,0.7342,5.1364,9.3337,0.3369,2.0511,1.2489,3.0416,5.1085,2.2842,4.4283,3.7394,1.5844,1.9175,2.3553,4.5945,2.9484,5.2108,0.7467,2.4293,0.1469,5.0745,4.1153,4.0775,1.4893,0.0003,0.0007,0.7568,0.7917,0.5744,0.2805,2.8792,7.0726,0.1117,4.7507,8.5661,1.5317,4.1131,6.3932,2.104,3.8733,1.1278,3.963,1.1527,0.0023,0.0005,0.4235,11.8829,6.4437,5.6305,2.0221,4.7915,0.3998,1.9836,2.078,5.4733,1.9309,5.8922,4.2647,9.878,0.8679,0.0235,1.3018,1.9188,0.1399,2.6698,3.9194,1.5835,3.567,0.0013,0.0009,9.9176,2.9955,5.1405,2.9017,8.5145,1.5782,0.1668,0.9374,1.0765,7.6117,3.2915,3.5201,0.0041,0.9116,4.453,2.894,1.0609,3.0035,5.7539,5.2703,2.3297,9.0069,2.4274,2.1976,4.3865,7.6817,0.0011,0.0013,0.0009,9.8633,2.8529,5.4647,5.8514,2.2637,1.3996,1.3448,6.1515,0.4406,6.9288,4.6648,2.7352,2.1833,0.0011,0.0008,0.7553,7.3939,3.1534,2.4633,1.5958,7.0921,1.2299,8.6805,1.9505,6.8452,7.8845,5.1477,2.6646,4.8801,1.0592,0.0003,2.8771,0.8045,0.0213,0.0151,0.0204,4.2372,2.1879,2.9291,6.3422,2.9711,5.193,1.7335,5.5822,2.1828,17.8072,2.1479,3.3718,1.5615,4.0065,0.0128,5.7002,5.5127,0.9914,18.1017,5.1994,4.8624,2.9672,7.849,4.6509,3.7895,0.8101,17.3099,5.2588,2.8809,2.3029,4.6005,2.3468,5.1607,7.5827,4.379,9.2552,4.4439,7.0077,5.1755,1.9305,0.624,0.0006,2.2397,4.4025,3.6761,0.7847,0.8783,0.2236,4.4344,0.0839,2.6478,0.002,0.0004,0.9505,6.2971,0.0374,5.4896,7.436,4.5269,1.0421,1.174,4.8077,0.3026,1.7671,3.0843,2.6608,2.9386,4.5857,3.1282,0.7909,1.6827,6.0934,0.0187,0.3041,4.9064,3.3536,0.4311,1.5098,0.7326,0.5022,6.3798,1.6172,3.0604,1.3514,1.2063,1.0506,0.152,1.1671,1.7078,6.4667,0.1232,1.3602,0.0004,0.0001,0.3284,2.7482,1.2174,2.588,3.2416,6.1573,1.9458,0.81,0.1528,0.1102,3.0051,0.0317,1.0615,0.0004,0.0002,0.1484,3.3075,0.0272,1.6395,3.6585,0.3883,3.7663,6.0735,11.823,0.0878,6.1181,0.9778,1.3933,0.0002,3.8096,0.6583,2.8693,4.7609,1.8418,2.2027,0.2386,0.0004,0.0003,4.5366,0.3338,1.7376,3.6687,0.8125,9.4639,0.34,1.1737,3.2876,2.5226,1.3363,4.1101,0.9975,1.6177,3.8762,0.1346,10.5481,6.9888,1.5964,4.0895,0.685,0.4857,9.5743,1.8045,8.4922,0.7337,0.032,1.3805,3.6028,1.038,0.88,0.3757,1.7167,4.3942,0.3529,0.0375,3.2024,2.8067,0.0019,0.002,0.0006,1.0751,16.8382,0.0107,3.4931,2.9352,0.0003,0.0003,4.0663,2.608,2.0292,4.998,2.9884,4.0665,3.5698,2.1928,0.2532,0.8715,0.001,0.0015,0.6977,2.7438,0.5585,3.2816,1.9841,2.5811,0.0027,7.8022,0.0549,0.1416,4.2291,4.5125,3.0359,1.7021,6.5576,1.1292,2.7737,2.0498,0.7073,0.9939,5.3987,4.1674,1.1448,0.0002,0.0005,2.774,2.4047,5.7965,4.3119,4.516,0.0154,0.0373,1.6904,4.708,3.2763,2.4768,1.1907,2.3361,2.3057,2.5962,4.3869,0.626,1.5073,6.2122,0.9042,0.0071,0.4597,1.0027,0.0002,5.4078,5.4613,1.1139,1.1738,0.536,5.0736,0.5692,1.7018,0.0005,0.0003,8.1496,3.7674,2.5344,0.0072,0.0412,1.0459,3.5004,0.4965,4.4072,0.3455,1.9103,3.3122,4.158,1.6522,3.91,1.0548,4.3742,6.2197,4.693,3.1214,1.5282,7.2016,0.3008,0.5059,3.2643,7.4132,9.2404,1.5703,3.8616,4.6778,0.1246,0.0022,1.2807,2.1351,3.4379,0.0386,1.6973,3.6051,3.812,0.0014,0.0021,0.0012,3.7677,0.0705,0.0042,0.0036,1.3059,2.8309,0.014,0.0006,3.7849,2.6619,2.788,0.0089,5.4514,1.2523,0.5324,5.8301,3.8407,1.4468,2.3135,2.6004,1.1421,4.2436,2.208,4.3213,1.6487,6.5224,2.8605,3.1482,1.4639,3.6646,3.3224,0.825,2.4456,2.3469,2.3313,3.7679,5.175,2.6958,5.4807,7.174,4.4046,2.5982,1.9141,3.0874,0.3248,0.1582,1.8273,1.484,0.019,0.001,0.8952,1.6027,1.8751,8.2158,4.6734,0.0023,0.0003,2.3716,5.1157,0.0264,1.5186,1.6798,0.1071,2.509,0.0462,6.3234,2.7523,1.5695,0.2397,0.9671,4.6635,5.6911,2.0527,0.0116,0.0014,4.5962,3.8238,3.9364,1.6234,7.1713,0.8992,5.1137,1.7681,4.8887,0.9697,0.2495,4.2794,0.8957,4.0184,3.1981,0.6353,0.322,0.7596]}

The more you pan and zoom through the satellite image the more zoom in and out you will have and it is possible to almost zoom all the way out and not be able to see the GPS symbol.","token_len":636,"entropy":[10.8943,0.271,10.8776,5.3116,7.3022,0.5109,2.9366,1.9698,8.404,2.5235,1.12,11.8764,11.2022,5.7227,6.5186,8.3372,2.4725,4.2446,0.2667,0.9347,9.6948,3.4569,2.2,9.1698,1.2483,2.3236,7.2928,2.8809,7.2129,0.0224,0.0012,0.0006,2.5913,4.1875,6.5865,2.078,1.2444,5.731,7.2682,11.4242,0.7496,3.874,1.1148,5.7329,1.412,1.2049,4.3014,2.5852,1.5404,5.7678,1.716,5.9966,4.8645,9.6623,1.4272,6.8576,7.8251,4.2118,8.3147,3.5427,0.5894,1.549,4.2511,0.7248,3.0918,0.0733,2.0082,2.4856,6.7462,0.0091,1.1684,5.5454,1.3181,2.3544,3.9932,1.6864,2.342,0.0279,1.4402,6.976,1.3693,0.0512,2.167,6.5173,2.3296,0.3705,1.4863,3.7245,3.972,4.0045,7.1071,7.7038,4.4265,3.8412,3.3806,0.9332,4.5066,3.6492,0.188,7.3671,2.5067,4.5088,1.9958,4.1765,7.365,3.4235,0.7281,0.5772,3.8443,4.2112,1.1015,4.1845,0.5962,0.6099,1.7051,2.1339,0.713,2.8938,7.9011,0.9268,2.8486,0.5313,1.9041,4.1237,0.6509,0.3795,1.3828,3.6605,6.4518,2.6053,0.3587,3.0586,1.2324,1.7378,6.4429,3.3858,3.2957,0.1855,3.4318,0.2111,1.2628,5.7078,8.3651,0.0057,7.8031,1.1549,0.0219,0.0898,1.5932,0.0674,0.2253,0.002,0.0306,3.7813,4.5643,4.8902,1.9401,0.6505,6.9101,3.7128,2.5699,3.0752,1.752,3.0304,3.0347,1.5032,0.1761,8.9098,4.5242,6.8672,0.0015,3.7256,1.1464,0.9946,1.7562,3.6856,3.7494,0.9656,4.0237,1.2997,2.6389,3.3946,0.1504,0.5237,8.7604,4.1889,0.0085,4.5534,0.524,0.0259,0.0838,0.0007,4.3301,4.0047,6.1932,0.7774,2.2516,7.9515,3.5547,8.0611,3.664,2.1777,6.9048,0.2901,0.0301,1.1249,7.6027,3.9709,0.5573,2.2407,7.4025,7.4075,0.4375,7.1996,1.53,3.8461,3.8822,7.9859,4.6978,2.8149,2.1419,3.1465,2.1851,1.2489,7.3959,1.573,3.2821,1.1887,4.7528,2.7979,6.8036,0.6477,3.0322,1.2106,1.4836,6.0651,3.7504,1.7866,4.6324,0.054,0.0423,4.0083,4.659,7.3548,7.5072,0.324,2.9391,3.589,0.9638,6.4797,1.5095,3.8832,5.1967,0.8251,3.1185,2.8244,3.3245,3.2619,0.6586,4.9442,0.5868,1.0742,8.9447,1.0628,1.3167,1.2358,0.9879,0.0003,5.2754,0.1268,5.9802,5.99,1.0113,0.0003,4.1021,0.1121,3.36,0.0589,1.425,1.6754,0.2981,2.7763,3.4048,1.432,0.2092,3.0199,4.5845,1.1434,2.0701,2.6763,5.7855,5.6407,1.4999,5.3179,1.4074,1.9248,1.3545,4.8354,2.5187,3.0423,1.6839,1.6364,3.1504,0.4951,5.9627,1.5479,3.1657,0.4088,4.8252,0.9216,6.9098,0.5773,1.3417,4.0667,4.4716,1.8476,0.8782,0.9597,1.0471,9.643,0.1527,0.9097,1.1771,8.5721,0.0618,0.362,0.9085,2.7362,0.3375,0.9933,4.8446,2.8606,4.3259,4.4424,4.1454,6.6257,0.2066,1.7787,0.2171,0.4153,5.0948,3.9014,4.73,6.0023,0.4856,0.0002,6.1512,0.1788,0.339,0.0717,3.0878,6.0668,6.525,5.6252,0.8734,5.346,0.941,0.8284,2.5652,2.34,1.5122,4.6636,1.4493,5.8893,0.9024,3.3152,1.3227,0.0002,3.7722,1.0954,4.5532,6.3535,7.2489,0.6685,0.0002,2.5595,0.2198,5.0367,1.0666,5.2429,2.4725,5.3253,0.2772,4.0625,1.5322,3.8316,0.4392,0.6408,2.8251,0.0267,0.0013,0.0014,6.8239,1.2406,4.2004,3.5613,3.8968,0.4301,4.2089,2.1956,0.8052,5.2647,1.4828,1.3789,8.4604,2.2031,3.9834,3.9319,4.7056,0.4162,1.8477,1.0432,2.2428,3.4381,2.3026,3.4544,2.5622,1.1363,0.2706,0.0002,5.7259,0.5173,6.7358,8.9037,3.5956,1.1807,0.3591,0.7273,0.7621,0.8139,0.5109,1.7467,2.9293,0.3049,8.7748,3.191,0.0644,1.1669,1.3153,0.9116,3.0817,1.6873,6.78,6.6386,1.0725,3.8463,6.5268,5.6423,2.2488,2.183,2.326,0.3487,7.005,1.2892,1.3966,0.7188,0.1158,2.5933,0.3232,0.8694,0.0002,2.8808,0.165,3.4689,0.0564,3.0578,1.9148,2.3897,0.052,1.3518,0.8672,0.6694,5.2072,4.2648,1.8276,0.014,3.468,1.7196,3.4714,4.8728,0.7318,0.054,4.9245,1.2821,3.1718,0.1551,1.964,0.0525,4.0316,0.653,1.3267,0.8067,0.5426,0.2161,2.69,1.1351,5.9635,2.5699,0.0451,6.5046,2.149,1.4302,0.9928,2.0628,0.077,3.8358,2.043,5.7061,1.8642,5.4225,1.3951,10.0403,2.8147,3.5237,4.1159,6.592,3.0489,0.4645,0.0512,0.3909,5.7364,5.7186,0.5637,0.0481,0.3068,4.4248,0.6278,2.8612,1.0431,3.1021,3.5867,3.2297,3.1771,0.8376,1.4393,2.9393,3.3964,1.6151,3.8065,2.6458,3.7583,4.1593,2.04,1.0888,0.9093,0.0035,4.9639,2.3495,2.2193,0.3661,0.2841,5.7705,4.5774,5.7099,2.6064,1.6766,4.5304,1.5524,0.149,2.3878,1.9932,0.713,3.8074,0.9669,0.0635,7.0017,2.9207,1.8624,0.0769,1.3755,1.8147,0.3893,2.8707,5.8377,4.6227,1.6201,0.3516,4.8512,0.6144,1.8901,1.2945,0.5347,5.4648,3.4453,4.6392,3.3294,0.4956,1.5598,2.1629,0.0143,0.5009,0.9717,0.037,6.3775,0.8866,3.1257,6.0225,1.4371,5.4445,1.5957,0.0392,6.6468,0.2484,2.3956,0.7546,0.9851,1.0588,4.5667,5.2848,0.9713,2.5973,1.1973,1.4866,1.9687,3.982,4.9446,2.8441,2.3997,0.1188,8.618,1.4022,4.4856,0.5754,0.1663,3.0955,3.4355,5.2564,1.8593,0.1513,0.0014,0.5469,0.6756,2.6875,8.1846,1.2233]}
{"id":4653,"ended":true,"length":548,"text":"The Mediterranean species Boletus < unk > somewhat resembles I. torosus, but can usually be distinguished by a smaller fruit body, a cylindrical stipe, and the lighter colours of younger mushrooms. The cap colour on the older specimens is darker. The pores can be easily distinguished ; the pores are large, black, and smooth while the spores are smooth. The cap margin, the gills and the pores smell like cheese (not true for I. torosus ). A gill often splits up to 1 cm from the margin. The flesh, when cut, is spongy and white, but if peeled and dried it keeps its pale colours. A firm flesh and a good smell are also important traits of Boletus fungi.\n\nThe cap is typically 6\u201323 cm across and often as much as 30 cm across. It is usually cylindrical or oblong-ovate, with a diameter of 2 to 4 cm. The underside of the cap has a faint or distinct ring, the stipe is whitish or pale pink, smooth, and cylindrical. The flesh turns yellowish as the fungus ages. The cap margin is usually curved upward, or slightly protruding, and sometimes has a fissure. The gills are white, thin, spreading, cylindrical, and thick. The mushrooms grow on stipes that are 1\u201315 cm long. When mature, the gills often curl at the stipe tip. The spore print is dark brown and the spores are smooth. The spore print is almost always brown.\n\nIt is common in Mediterranean climate zones, but it has also been recorded at altitudes of 1500 metres and older. It is edible but usually regarded simply as a variety ; it has similar properties to wild Boletus.\n\nThe young mushrooms have red caps and grey stipe, while older specimens are brownish, yellowish, sometimes greenish in colour. The mature fruit bodies are often covered with large greyish-brown or pink scales.\n\nIn temperate climates it can occur in various habitats, but in cold climates it is very rare. It is often found in high altitude forests, in the same habitat which contains other economically important wild Boletus.\n\nThe cap colour of younger fruit bodies ranges from yellowish to orange ; it can often be white. The stipe colour is white when young, but turning greyish with age. The colour of the flesh can vary between whitish and pale brown.\n\nThe colour of the underside of the cap can be whitish, greyish, brownish with pinkish undertones ; in mature specimens it is yellowish or pale yellow. The cap margin is usually curved upward, or slightly protruding, and sometimes has a fissure. The gill margin is usually curved outward. The pore surfaces are smooth, smooth when dry, and pinkish. The spores have a dark brown print and they are smooth. The spore print can turn pinkish and the spores are brown. The spore print is pinkish when young, eventually turn orange, then yellowish.","token_len":637,"entropy":[11.2997,11.3088,11.104,4.6251,0.567,10.9511,11.312,6.137,6.2525,11.0085,2.4324,7.2481,3.9593,7.2323,5.7061,1.4886,1.1734,1.2811,5.4817,6.8711,0.165,1.0925,1.0238,2.0139,5.4646,6.857,4.6736,1.7117,2.2722,8.2252,0.0013,0.0053,5.8751,2.2237,0.9089,0.5509,3.2363,8.1543,7.9223,0.6139,9.7498,7.1584,0.521,2.0541,6.8322,6.2829,5.373,0.903,6.3952,3.1884,0.5159,3.2172,2.5264,1.8991,9.9615,5.8376,0.2792,3.8272,3.1924,10.5171,1.5428,5.4717,1.2896,4.2994,1.3202,6.2644,1.3583,0.643,4.7793,6.9402,0.3578,5.5708,0.404,3.6897,0.8822,1.1612,3.5043,7.5298,3.8667,3.5873,6.9628,0.925,1.2705,1.5341,4.3575,10.8191,2.1964,7.3788,4.4344,4.6803,5.8063,5.2646,2.6384,0.171,0.3697,0.023,0.0039,3.4812,3.7706,6.7534,1.2271,6.3382,6.9537,4.7155,3.6495,4.6999,2.7525,2.9346,0.1247,5.9014,1.8651,1.0451,4.8617,3.9549,3.4799,3.5662,0.8751,0.6368,6.8716,0.3771,0.0108,0.95,3.8983,1.6893,2.4031,4.6986,5.3792,2.52,3.6176,1.6117,8.6852,2.1095,9.8106,4.1359,0.7141,3.0383,7.4186,4.0238,3.3401,1.2979,4.072,4.1379,1.7558,3.9074,4.3491,5.4671,1.3867,2.111,0.0066,0.005,8.0139,0.3727,2.8645,0.0196,2.4424,5.4203,2.6668,6.5591,6.7829,4.218,6.6445,0.5953,3.9316,1.4583,4.5239,5.508,3.8457,0.0179,2.7545,0.4194,2.8705,0.5225,2.0731,0.8497,2.2989,6.6493,0.0,0.0122,4.0904,6.0613,0.0264,6.1915,13.391,3.8249,1.1108,1.6863,1.1474,4.0493,0.2432,3.0012,3.9344,1.5539,0.5536,0.6189,0.8805,5.3277,1.3795,0.0837,0.3946,2.1424,0.764,6.7654,5.3273,6.3189,3.6115,2.2253,4.0136,5.7284,0.1211,1.5059,6.7744,0.0087,2.8477,4.187,3.5011,1.0107,8.5195,1.1692,0.4966,7.0868,0.0001,0.0178,0.7839,0.6761,3.9476,7.7117,3.3449,2.7311,4.5295,1.4056,5.0278,3.5989,0.5906,0.9993,1.5592,4.254,0.5591,2.222,6.5721,6.1558,1.2011,3.9962,3.1796,5.4369,0.2265,1.1659,1.4914,3.7465,2.9632,0.5627,7.1273,0.9972,0.0078,1.641,0.7689,4.8989,0.2232,0.8733,3.6695,1.1441,5.7107,0.5621,9.5841,1.3165,7.4467,0.0002,0.0383,0.2964,0.6041,4.2939,0.7916,0.6295,5.1764,2.904,2.5246,5.8467,5.6216,2.5059,0.626,4.8543,1.2601,4.8395,0.2053,1.0114,1.0846,4.3996,4.3052,0.543,0.7083,4.3053,0.0502,4.6293,6.2744,4.3569,0.3724,6.7129,0.21,4.8347,1.4456,1.1033,4.7113,0.2754,6.2186,0.8187,3.9213,1.2811,2.1624,2.4471,1.0824,0.5815,4.1096,0.542,0.992,3.6472,0.0279,2.819,0.7523,4.6105,2.0713,4.6925,1.6391,1.7269,0.0003,4.401,0.3788,2.8964,2.6571,5.5566,8.1445,8.141,2.2677,2.0747,2.4601,2.9076,2.5881,0.1186,3.3817,4.0846,4.8567,0.0057,0.9849,7.0296,4.6314,1.8474,8.7884,0.6842,1.8532,0.7172,6.6111,3.3663,4.0949,8.8747,8.0717,0.0467,0.8136,8.2097,9.4839,1.8971,2.4387,6.6563,3.58,0.5938,5.268,4.2454,0.0112,0.022,2.2399,1.5117,0.0003,1.9917,6.6773,1.3572,2.504,5.5165,5.9462,1.6858,6.0109,3.7687,0.8555,2.221,3.4664,3.1949,1.8219,1.5202,3.4093,2.4409,1.8067,3.8782,0.771,0.576,5.9973,3.5853,0.551,4.2378,0.2198,0.7752,0.99,4.5113,7.0377,4.3291,0.5644,3.5398,4.3475,0.5669,4.6548,5.7598,4.4868,1.8016,1.0814,3.782,4.051,3.8847,0.801,1.9395,0.0003,3.6565,5.5584,0.01,1.4961,3.138,2.3476,3.9136,1.1748,5.2773,4.0367,1.2624,1.8385,2.4917,5.0568,0.8559,0.6661,0.7038,3.9955,1.0841,0.2732,1.684,0.6344,3.5249,1.6384,0.6019,5.6938,2.8856,4.0322,1.2815,2.1827,2.7056,5.5104,3.6758,6.0913,3.7089,4.5612,10.6907,0.9014,4.9228,0.8919,0.0074,0.0255,2.4363,1.0442,0.0003,2.0652,3.467,3.7019,2.5372,6.5633,8.5501,2.1445,4.8844,0.1366,2.5467,1.4968,0.5378,3.0329,5.0814,2.3048,2.591,4.4258,0.1454,4.348,1.8208,1.3776,4.4531,0.0419,4.0922,0.7916,3.5339,3.6099,2.3453,0.891,1.6389,9.4921,3.4909,3.9978,4.5246,0.1365,0.9467,0.8748,6.0976,0.9657,0.9189,3.4097,3.4082,1.2355,2.9075,6.338,0.0252,0.5812,2.3942,3.086,0.8543,1.2796,0.0003,1.4733,5.6364,0.3843,0.6597,5.7699,0.3916,0.0857,0.161,2.5771,0.9788,6.0055,0.0048,1.501,4.7909,0.3818,0.5416,3.5984,1.2646,5.6868,7.0377,1.5885,5.3697,0.5221,4.2465,4.0637,6.9373,1.1511,1.2907,0.8397,3.0117,0.3608,2.2825,2.0552,1.9063,0.7652,1.0176,1.9251,1.0058,0.5036,1.8756,2.4949,0.6351,0.6474,0.6559,0.186,0.039,0.0022,0.418,0.1541,0.151,0.0792,0.0545,0.2366,0.006,0.0045,0.0645,0.3471,2.438,4.3961,7.0944,0.2236,1.0436,1.2193,3.795,1.7555,0.5912,4.6175,0.1552,6.906,0.3453,2.5902,1.4112,3.4874,6.3142,6.111,0.444,0.5413,5.5187,0.7954,2.8255,0.6896,2.3177,3.6514,0.9423,3.6751,2.099,8.7418,2.3629,4.6678,1.4797,5.0493,0.6091,1.2743,3.5598,0.0109,0.4457,3.9094,4.2264,2.7575,1.4486,2.9869,2.2511,0.7988,0.8941,4.4962,0.811,2.1427,3.2765,0.0086,1.4732,0.5212,5.6895,0.5833,2.6899,1.5026,1.4383,10.0176,6.7284,3.7614,2.5827,2.6237,1.9776,0.4548,0.9174]}
{"id":4915,"ended":true,"length":442,"text":"Polyketides are synthesized by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes as well as iterative and multimodular enzymes that share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases. They comprise a large number of highly diverse, structurally-related family members, most of which can be produced by bacteria, fungi, and plants, and they have attracted considerable attention for their roles in biofuel production and as drugs of interest (Table 1). Due to their large variation, the synthesis of polyketides often involves the use of a number of enzymes, often co-expressed with each other. The different enzyme mixtures can also use different synthesis substrates and can therefore serve as source of multiple isoprenoid intermediates. To assess the influence of the composition of the co-protein and the subunit sequence as well as the enzymatic function of the enzymes on the kinetic efficiency of a polyketide synthesis, here we use the polyketides 2-propionyl-4-hydroxycoumarin (2HCC), 4-hydroxy-2-propionyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-indole (FHC or 4-PIPH, 5HHC, or 5HIPH), the 3-ketone ester derivative (TEE or CIEH, 6-TEE), and 2-propenoyl 2-hydroxy-3-ketosulfate (PPK, 7H2RSO4) as substrates for a catalytic system composed of two enzymes (a core of PKS-2, a phosphinase CIEH) and one-component, immobilized polyelectrolyte (PES\u2013PKS-2) as the reaction substrate and the corresponding acetate, propionate, keto ester derivatives as carbon sources. The presence of an isotherm at a molecular scale in the co-protein can influence the binding and the activity of the enzyme. We found that the PKS\u2013PKS-2 binding to TEE is significantly different from the other co-proteins, and this difference is even more pronounced in the binding of FHC which may be partly responsible for the reduction in the specific activity of the catalysis. We further found that the 2HPC is cleaved from the co-protein substrate before the synthesis of the corresponding keto ester derivative with an average rate at 37 \u00b0C of \u221280 \u00b1 8%. The high rate of cleavage of 2HPC after the formation of the keto ester backbone may lead to further unwanted formation and degradation of side products. The cleavage of 2HPC can be completely blocked by introducing the TEE subunit. On the other hand, the hydrolysis of PPK is independent from the TEE subunit with a rate constant of 3.6 \u00d7 105 M\u22121 s\u22121 at 37 \u00b0C. Furthermore, this enzyme was also active in an incubation reactor containing the immobilized PES\u2013PKS-2 substrate but not when dissolved in the reaction mixture.","token_len":637,"entropy":[9.9456,6.3382,3.1384,5.9585,0.1129,1.4861,5.5457,3.9193,0.94,5.0594,0.5445,5.6035,3.5127,1.1976,0.7208,6.2942,0.0798,3.1702,11.2932,3.3831,5.3956,1.3043,0.0069,12.1072,0.7507,3.9461,7.9875,0.2591,4.6814,2.8032,3.4092,7.4359,8.6953,0.4129,3.7933,1.2207,2.0508,6.2798,0.3464,2.214,1.3929,1.1841,4.0565,4.7069,2.2219,3.1634,1.603,0.0073,4.782,5.0597,3.664,7.2452,0.0035,4.254,3.485,6.0807,0.8827,1.3958,4.1646,0.9013,0.2014,4.3047,0.4575,6.2163,1.3421,6.1627,1.4712,0.7486,0.3668,1.3653,4.0041,2.1084,1.3619,3.3783,2.4997,7.5726,2.6435,0.5623,2.6996,0.2807,4.5322,0.0845,4.9231,3.7165,0.7559,1.5042,4.2511,7.4717,4.9035,4.292,4.1032,5.0914,0.786,0.1928,7.4392,0.0172,0.5207,3.642,5.9459,1.6783,2.0756,4.9172,0.3171,3.9855,0.058,0.0839,6.4253,2.2586,2.6982,2.6758,0.012,2.4583,2.4071,0.0054,2.3025,1.4131,4.8289,5.8555,0.2142,5.9527,0.1395,2.0936,3.3217,0.1365,1.9121,2.0411,6.0264,4.5524,7.5465,0.2487,3.0081,2.7711,5.8535,1.0472,6.0343,5.402,0.0006,2.305,4.3185,4.1831,6.0112,0.698,5.9659,1.3418,5.3813,7.8784,3.1259,2.5964,3.0876,3.9655,0.0043,1.1232,5.3108,4.7173,0.5193,4.8193,0.0522,2.2458,4.8768,0.118,1.6352,5.9447,0.2133,6.4456,3.3898,1.5357,5.9793,0.8339,7.4817,5.7822,0.9194,0.0022,0.5626,4.8694,0.0011,0.0146,5.0997,0.3013,1.245,2.7398,1.7575,0.6313,8.5218,5.6886,0.296,3.6625,1.1912,0.024,0.0955,2.8534,0.588,6.6722,0.2301,3.2952,1.6985,5.544,0.1341,1.7028,5.6319,1.4756,6.5089,1.0669,0.1291,1.6472,2.5243,0.2392,3.0451,0.128,4.4361,3.2784,0.0317,0.3733,1.0504,3.1547,6.2242,8.0869,2.7401,2.9613,0.2297,1.1049,0.0504,1.6105,2.1924,0.3596,2.5656,0.1624,0.048,0.1276,1.7293,2.8294,1.4018,0.1761,2.3433,0.9684,0.0031,0.9977,0.6513,2.2493,3.0006,0.4009,4.9267,0.1895,1.9447,6.0557,6.2054,8.1143,3.4747,1.4498,5.657,4.7379,3.2321,4.8518,5.6504,1.5978,2.4091,2.2511,1.3747,1.5585,0.6874,1.9519,0.7284,0.6469,4.785,2.8282,0.4751,5.2894,4.1469,6.7089,0.1232,8.5969,1.7723,5.0374,5.1363,2.3504,4.2655,4.7749,5.4906,1.9193,3.3673,1.6288,4.0717,0.5463,1.6628,0.8474,3.2408,0.2464,4.5609,5.4192,8.2075,0.3234,6.1014,0.3954,1.3003,0.204,0.871,1.8693,0.5965,4.6989,5.3884,2.7563,2.2067,0.2319,4.7134,3.469,3.3944,1.1393,0.9809,5.0289,9.0762,5.4287,5.0166,1.997,0.9396,3.0143,0.0024,1.246,3.6017,5.5928,0.0535,2.9764,4.6559,0.0985,2.6725,3.929,2.1809,6.0122,7.7165,2.6572,4.3642,5.4913,3.4973,2.2389,2.0488,1.6451,5.4094,6.7442,2.2368,4.3854,8.5235,0.0849,4.7987,0.4812,2.4278,5.6942,3.0545,4.2159,11.4134,0.3026,1.7745,9.7599,0.3131,0.4626,0.6451,1.8882,2.3461,3.9276,8.3557,2.8886,9.4881,1.8729,0.8541,1.3058,2.4024,2.886,6.6195,2.4373,3.1318,2.0811,5.5739,6.3826,4.1141,3.3976,5.5361,0.0675,1.7768,0.2626,6.8747,3.9614,6.0393,0.0636,4.9572,3.4358,5.8754,6.2187,0.8367,1.3622,5.9367,0.0614,3.8239,4.1137,6.9585,1.1993,4.3423,3.7091,4.3199,2.3078,2.889,0.8286,4.2868,0.0481,1.6867,3.7536,4.2129,0.2513,5.1289,3.1683,3.6881,4.0832,0.0167,0.857,2.5874,1.6183,3.5692,2.8091,0.2058,1.0722,4.2284,1.0495,1.3588,2.111,0.0871,0.579,0.0243,4.1765,4.1394,5.7701,0.1097,2.6503,2.6097,2.8707,0.534,1.4608,4.3709,3.7183,0.0118,4.1327,1.8232,0.1651,1.662,2.0159,2.9425,1.9465,1.3788,5.2687,0.5926,0.4222,0.8846,0.5775,6.5739,1.3848,4.5824,0.1109,7.4225,5.3815,1.2526,5.3613,1.8066,0.0218,0.3289,5.5385,0.6767,1.325,7.1107,2.9247,0.1528,0.6746,7.4293,2.548,2.571,2.9412,2.6033,1.0532,0.1453,0.6144,4.309,1.0704,7.1033,3.7959,7.7684,0.1262,2.6047,0.8229,5.0854,0.0128,1.5424,7.0887,5.8164,0.9868,3.206,0.3595,1.1728,5.5611,4.2683,1.9802,0.4304,0.0906,1.9614,4.1741,2.9777,6.3072,4.2322,5.5316,8.6546,4.76,0.047,3.7888,6.7791,3.7862,4.5294,3.1861,4.0056,1.6353,5.4194,1.7602,0.3785,1.9313,0.0118,1.4937,3.0603,0.2527,0.2206,3.5717,1.1589,3.5244,0.0311,1.0246,2.7936,0.3081,0.0869,0.0078,8.441,3.1942,4.2918,0.0252,5.8523,8.7041,4.8632,3.7013,2.5479,0.2081,9.6849,6.6694,1.7497,1.8929,5.1082,0.0131,0.7016,1.5396,0.0241,0.0212,3.294,1.4338,6.1281,2.031,0.4082,6.9026,2.0878,5.4893,0.2666,5.4363,0.2222,2.5357,5.5229,0.1459,0.1745,0.0025,0.0224,0.8156,5.9582,0.1554,0.0903,0.1902,5.3569,0.0143,2.6116,6.4737,2.7399,0.204,4.2288,0.0105,2.4624,0.0147,5.3887,1.4756,1.3709,7.8703,0.2701,4.4817,0.435,2.5997,3.8932,3.4486,3.3298,4.9439,1.1283,6.112,0.0531,0.0142,3.1061,3.542,0.0283,0.0003,1.0769,4.2901,0.0133,3.873,3.8362,3.825,3.2391,6.1941,1.3853,4.6485,5.9125,0.1035,9.6399,4.3807,2.4602,8.7693,0.0242,2.2934,1.3255,0.504,0.0665,0.0499,0.3461,0.0088,2.7407,4.2491,1.6026,6.2768,6.8099,0.2483,1.8917,5.0886,2.1159,0.6128]}
{"id":3300,"ended":true,"length":545,"text":"In the first years of the 20th century, several navies worldwide experimented with the idea of a new type of battleship with a uniform armament of very heavy guns. Admiral Vittorio Cuniberti, considered one of the best Navy commanders of his time, thought a lot about warships and, before the Second World War, he thought of a way to combine armor and speed by having the battleships built with \"fins\" \u2013 i.e. with the hulls arranged asymmetrically to accommodate the powerful batteries necessary to dominate enemy fleets, and, in Cuniberti's mind, to be able to fight and win against them.\n\nAfter World War I, only two ships were built with similar armament (one being built by the British but was never completed), and the idea gradually faded as ship propulsion improved to allow faster vessel operation. But in 1939, the Cuniberti doctrine re-emerged when the German U-Boats started to invade convoys in the Atlantic.\n\nIt is not very often that ideas have a chance to come true due to events rather than due to planned development and research. But, with the exception of the U-Boats and the British Type 27 battleships, the Cuniberti doctrine was the only one that was ever implemented : the British battleship class was the only battleship class in history to be armed with all main guns forward.\n\nAt the time, Cuniberti was working with the Italian Navy as Chief of Staff, and when German U-boats started to attack convoys in the Atlantic of the 1930ies, Italy was the only major ally at that time that could contribute significant vessels (such as the battleship ) to the fight.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Cuniberti's doctrine was put to the test against the American and British fleets. Cuniberti lost to both the British and Americans, as well as against Germany's submarines. This was not surprising, as the U.S.S.R. could not build submarines fast enough to keep up with the U.S. Navy. Still, in spite of this, Italy inflicted quite a hefty blow in the Mediterranean against the British Navy, as well as in the North Sea.\n\nCuniberti was awarded the Cross of the Iron Crown in 1938 and, in 1939, he was appointed to an important post in the Italian government. In 1943, Cuniberti was assigned a command in the Mediterranean, where, at the time of the Allies landing on Sicily, he was fighting against the German Navy. On July 3, 1943, the Italian battleship Repugnant was torpedoed and wrecked. Her captain, General Pietro Tosi, and ten crewmen died trying to escape. The German submarine U-575 then fired another bomb on Tosi's body as a trophy. Although the Italian navy was eventually destroyed at the end of World War II, the Cuniberti doctrine survived the war and was applied to the new Italian battleship class begun in 1950, which has been an outstanding success in the current world naval power competition.","token_len":637,"entropy":[2.6222,3.9575,6.2874,0.5424,1.0903,2.8953,0.0089,0.1207,0.1617,6.531,11.01,0.0071,7.631,6.525,0.0662,2.1255,2.6334,0.0859,2.3697,4.0387,2.6457,0.0098,6.6955,0.0993,4.31,1.2917,8.7666,6.152,0.0236,2.4006,8.2246,3.0058,2.256,0.8735,6.8714,5.5877,4.0863,0.0322,4.7704,3.5346,9.1549,5.2302,1.4401,6.145,1.9411,0.0275,0.1586,2.7103,6.7713,2.203,0.5875,1.8721,0.5277,0.1081,4.3357,3.8568,6.0284,0.1943,6.1959,2.4245,4.7713,5.2482,2.1055,3.0821,0.0167,0.0006,0.0745,1.9957,3.5033,2.0186,1.717,5.7818,0.3433,4.9486,7.7569,0.9315,3.6744,5.2219,3.0358,2.4716,4.4203,0.5713,5.4117,2.9887,5.3929,4.9407,5.7323,1.0948,5.4715,7.8543,0.0023,0.0007,0.8029,5.6009,2.7702,2.7676,1.3941,6.3362,8.8632,0.0078,0.0002,3.0075,4.9241,0.9255,6.8152,6.8803,6.0431,0.5368,8.4191,3.7031,4.1809,3.7951,2.0392,4.4485,1.8888,7.4738,0.0329,0.0105,0.04,0.0045,2.9894,0.018,2.1601,3.0566,1.5081,0.0077,3.4525,4.6128,0.6611,3.1364,4.1328,0.9816,1.1541,0.0009,4.7177,1.714,0.0011,1.71,0.2375,5.8213,2.0868,2.8574,1.2545,0.5613,2.8656,5.368,1.7732,0.9562,3.7732,3.5053,4.3915,2.5479,1.7094,1.327,2.9095,5.2078,4.3918,2.5621,3.9984,2.0099,1.2547,1.6892,5.0678,6.7484,3.6087,2.8238,4.9775,9.8089,4.2945,4.1333,1.9776,3.8465,5.6028,6.3042,0.6792,3.4327,2.1986,4.4732,0.4543,1.666,5.8835,0.299,0.0372,0.7215,7.8053,6.7457,1.4206,0.14,0.0018,4.5333,1.2122,2.7876,4.9296,0.089,5.5803,0.0595,4.026,1.6681,5.1349,10.5245,0.0127,2.6415,0.8095,4.0067,1.2287,2.5285,0.0002,4.0548,2.0506,2.5536,5.4371,3.8462,0.2812,8.7136,3.9714,3.0858,3.9094,0.6437,3.0945,2.4953,6.337,0.0059,6.4804,7.2028,0.0116,2.3514,0.0291,8.0505,3.0417,3.0686,6.0542,0.3797,2.525,2.8341,3.7976,0.8407,4.5981,0.003,0.6364,3.4801,0.2296,0.8395,0.0127,2.5059,0.6713,4.33,7.4127,5.1376,4.7846,0.6371,0.2838,1.7069,3.7368,0.0285,0.0085,0.2007,1.1912,1.7943,3.2499,2.5367,2.2436,1.3471,1.7293,2.7232,4.14,10.9351,1.5353,4.1091,5.2977,1.2146,6.394,1.1161,3.1473,1.4535,5.3913,0.0083,2.254,2.8132,3.0334,0.7917,1.4179,5.9893,0.1664,4.9059,8.0538,2.0595,9.178,3.5342,1.2759,0.0003,4.836,0.609,0.9734,0.9854,3.2686,0.0169,0.0053,0.1024,0.7832,5.8334,2.1558,1.0119,3.7136,1.6411,3.1384,7.8466,0.5528,2.3166,1.4092,1.2024,4.2873,5.9675,3.619,0.023,2.1811,2.0042,0.6252,0.8543,0.8684,0.004,0.9861,0.1937,0.4707,7.1113,1.7882,3.4709,11.8097,0.2581,6.3352,1.8669,2.8326,1.4068,2.8395,4.3658,5.1297,4.3246,0.0823,3.0804,1.3684,6.3525,6.6068,7.9213,4.5282,3.7105,0.0084,0.3819,5.5909,1.1469,6.9873,0.7237,0.527,2.9213,1.0093,1.2464,0.0002,3.9165,0.8146,2.0829,0.0143,0.0005,0.1973,2.5418,0.0123,0.0029,0.104,2.788,3.9081,0.9042,4.3811,1.2053,0.8528,0.0512,4.4162,0.7774,3.8925,2.8075,0.7406,3.7762,1.395,4.9061,0.0777,0.0086,0.1113,5.2844,4.6198,2.8175,1.4457,2.2181,0.3218,2.921,1.9031,4.2624,1.3216,0.0146,4.5246,5.7974,1.4575,5.2182,1.2091,3.8637,1.6514,2.9901,3.5464,1.6173,1.163,1.1757,2.1684,1.398,0.0177,0.0572,6.0657,0.0663,1.0745,0.2367,4.7852,0.9857,5.1223,3.6934,5.7887,0.0065,0.6921,4.3789,0.7524,0.202,0.74,2.1511,0.5346,0.0333,0.1287,3.6928,1.8217,6.0502,0.0609,3.1883,3.4938,0.0056,2.0911,0.6284,5.5944,10.768,5.2062,0.4511,6.9963,2.0204,3.3367,0.7428,5.3381,3.049,0.6907,2.5992,3.9734,1.9184,2.7132,1.6146,0.0657,2.7062,0.4519,3.4204,0.9605,2.0701,0.6207,0.0002,3.2947,0.0699,0.0033,0.1138,1.4103,5.323,0.5658,6.5008,0.6134,1.8686,4.6721,5.2211,1.4243,3.7641,2.1694,3.8349,1.8206,1.9569,0.0529,3.0566,0.8789,3.1809,2.0692,5.3317,4.0709,0.8448,1.0623,0.5858,1.9903,3.745,0.7111,2.2158,4.0198,0.1838,1.7705,0.0063,0.003,0.1389,1.0569,4.0064,4.0959,4.4055,2.9159,0.5862,4.2753,1.5743,1.8869,3.0167,3.3748,0.4938,2.7262,1.6893,1.1057,5.8095,5.3882,1.5275,2.2044,0.5532,0.6616,0.9714,5.1605,1.9715,0.808,2.8508,3.2166,0.9969,4.367,3.4358,3.5231,0.4264,1.4165,0.0421,1.8844,2.2995,4.8849,0.2464,9.5186,4.6334,3.4637,2.2084,2.6704,0.0171,2.3659,5.9786,2.8296,6.9538,2.511,0.8345,3.3272,4.1263,0.0358,4.5274,3.9203,0.3685,3.589,6.9329,2.4821,1.1208,3.2789,6.8465,0.0044,3.8795,1.0504,2.0699,4.2405,2.4622,3.3402,0.5812,10.1997,5.7271,4.9689,6.9685,6.6127,0.9235,5.5906,0.0011,0.3403,6.5785,4.4373,3.4699,7.6457,1.221,5.2159,1.2337,3.2151,3.049,1.6908,5.7012,3.293,4.5,0.876,2.4066,0.0099,3.1439,0.0005,0.0781,0.1297,1.1908,2.329,0.0101,0.0037,0.165,0.2642,4.3654,2.3449,0.7894,1.6895,1.5952,5.8307,0.425,1.1585,4.8298,3.2479,2.1191,0.6832,2.8424,10.7032,0.3681,4.3407,2.3884,2.432,3.6423,1.7948,5.7012,5.4679,2.6136,1.7919,1.156,4.3898,3.7935,4.5885,5.6785,2.8833,0.2422]}

Algeria (CAL) Prime Minister, Houari Boumedienne was assassinated by four people including  Ahmed Larbi Benbrahim (who was not a military member), on the evening of March 22, 1958, in the port city of Mechecoul, Algiers.\n\nIt was claimed that Larbi had been waiting two years for the assassination of the Prime Minister, but Boumedienne\u2019s last words were not only a call to calm, they were to stop the massacre of the Jews in his country and to seek forgiveness for acts committed against Jews by a \u201ctraitor.\u201d L\u2019Association de lutte contre l\u2019antis\u00e9mitisme ( ALASS ) in Paris condemned the murder of the Prime Minister and the brutal attacks on the synagogue in Algiers, as had been the case in the neighboring and French-occupied city of Oran. ALASS, as well as the Algerian Jewish community and the Zionist community, demanded that Larbi be hanged. = Second Mosque of Algiers = The second terrorist attack at the Jewish synagogue in Algiers took place on March 24, 1957, when two cars of \u201cguerrillas\u201d fired on the synagogue at 21:40. There were seven dead and at least 30 others were wounded (see : April 23 Mechecoul massacre ). The perpetrators of the attack claimed the action was taken at the insistence of Boumedienne. Three people confessed to the attack. The leader of this so-called \u201cMechecoul Affair\u201d (the name of the town where the attack against the Jews was perpetrated) of \u201cLe Grand Blanc\u201d was Pierre Salinger, a former student of the Ecole normale superieure (ENS), and former member of the Front du Milieu.

{"id":4575,"ended":true,"length":554,"text":"As part of the Trans @ - @ Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, Alyeska was required to remove most traces of the 31 pipeline construction camps. Seven camps closed in November 1976, and three have been destroyed since then. The remainder are undergoing decommissioning work -- including the \"Camps of the Future,\" which is a fancy way of saying that they'll be left in perpetuity. \"Alyeska continues to be an important part of the rich Alaskan legacy, and has a strong commitment to maintaining the ecological balance and protection of this unique wilderness,\" said John Hickey, Alyeska President and CEO.\n\nAfter nearly four decades, only two camps from Alaska's largest oilfield (one on Wrangell Island, the other in Valdez) remain in significant use. The rest have been abandoned. The first one in action was Camp 12 at Point Hope, which closed in 1982. \"Point Hope is now a state park, and is in many ways the'mother ship' for all remaining camps,\" said Alyeska's environmental management leader. \"Alyeska continues to work closely with Alaska state and federal agencies on developing a comprehensive plan for Point Hope.\" Camp 23 and Camp 29 in Wrangell and Valdez closed in 2006 and 2009, respectively; both are now managed by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources as part of Cook Inlet State Park, an ecological preserve.\n\nIn addition, the camps at Wrangell\/St. Mary and Valdez are managed by the Kenai Peninsula Borough (KPB) for the National Park Service (NPS). Park rangers conduct on-site and off-site maintenance, and the camps are operated by the Park Service to facilitate access to the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, a major swath of Alaska's coast. Park rangers conduct routine facility and visitor assessments, as well as ongoing camp management. These camps are popular destinations for visitors wishing to experience Alaskan history, and the parks continue to develop programming to enhance these spaces and share these sites' rich story.\n\nAlyeska is working with the PBK and NPS to secure additional funding that will enable the removal of one of four cabins at Wrangell\/St. Mary to preserve the remaining intact native village. Alyeska has also worked with the KPB to relocate four cabins located at Valdez into Port Valdez to create Camp 27A at Port Valdez. Camp 27A was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998.\n\nAlyeska is also involved in ongoing discussions with the NPS on the future of Camp 30 at Wrangell. With Alyeska's support, funding has been secured to secure the last two cabins at the camp (Camp 23 & 27), which will then be moved from the current camp site to an area off-site. The relocation will allow the NPS to improve current infrastructure and further enhance the visitor experience. Alyeska also continues to support a proposal to turn Camp 29 into a year-round museum. As an additional development, there are plans to return camp management to the Ketchikan-based Central Peninsula Borough (CPB).","token_len":644,"entropy":[6.6379,0.0069,1.2464,8.2222,11.5568,7.6918,3.955,9.4043,3.6566,8.9432,0.8228,0.6907,13.2614,2.8332,0.0422,3.8832,3.3727,0.1217,5.5461,5.7614,8.6124,0.057,1.7348,9.5446,4.1093,4.3873,8.5376,2.7652,8.6889,3.7801,6.437,1.9563,3.6703,9.7148,1.3216,1.3133,4.0772,4.0172,1.556,5.4611,1.3896,0.7193,0.267,2.0568,6.0362,1.715,7.3018,5.3084,0.0103,0.044,6.3526,7.0022,2.7427,1.6278,5.5294,4.4141,4.0123,2.5856,1.2356,2.3688,1.4114,1.2526,2.2768,2.8524,8.2574,2.5881,0.0388,0.275,2.2955,3.312,3.6631,0.661,5.5616,2.3641,6.0823,0.0072,0.7027,4.9896,4.3208,1.4334,0.0279,0.0061,5.3929,0.124,2.1294,2.5406,1.3637,1.5324,0.0177,0.6759,11.1594,8.6885,0.005,0.0043,6.9437,2.4877,1.0682,3.8121,2.7463,2.4468,3.6173,0.0599,4.2,1.6912,6.5737,2.9688,2.5378,5.9989,0.0698,3.8631,3.0613,5.5605,2.0543,1.105,4.4603,4.0864,4.5194,0.0734,5.1964,0.0031,0.0028,3.4174,0.6873,0.1477,0.24,2.2214,0.0036,5.3908,4.3919,3.0954,0.5684,2.2712,5.9574,2.3348,3.0347,7.3034,3.0258,0.9342,3.3369,2.0283,3.2228,5.0196,5.5336,3.169,7.1062,5.53,0.0149,2.0302,1.5591,2.2734,0.0791,2.0534,6.4726,0.0058,0.5038,0.532,2.3265,8.3954,3.1836,0.7755,1.6862,3.8824,2.8409,0.4065,2.0106,1.8645,1.9781,3.7188,2.828,2.7892,11.1259,1.5946,7.5384,5.0204,3.2882,4.9742,6.4328,1.1929,2.0634,2.5903,0.4532,3.967,0.758,4.1416,7.8554,0.0302,1.5855,3.4109,1.8259,5.9468,1.3577,1.3313,1.1646,2.8398,3.8139,4.8824,0.1623,1.304,17.7683,8.1936,10.7668,9.3314,4.3628,4.6124,6.5538,3.0373,1.1104,0.7185,3.8735,0.0062,0.0026,2.227,6.6972,4.7376,6.034,2.8045,1.2949,3.6677,2.7225,0.0096,0.005,2.9351,0.0391,2.8699,2.9029,0.0145,3.8121,4.6162,1.3476,0.4339,1.2033,2.4639,5.4924,2.0368,3.1855,0.892,1.1041,6.4887,0.0077,2.1164,3.3959,5.4484,4.9494,0.7203,4.0168,2.7373,4.3527,0.1356,0.0029,4.2116,5.2374,0.0001,3.1522,0.317,4.3988,2.4052,2.3162,2.3207,0.0186,4.1958,2.6569,1.8472,2.1141,6.5336,0.4081,0.9833,1.5346,0.8516,0.0023,1.1737,0.0037,5.4714,1.7147,0.0009,12.442,5.0675,0.2174,5.9805,0.2693,2.1234,3.4974,5.1419,2.6698,1.683,1.4482,0.0002,3.0237,2.5905,1.9795,1.6286,5.8216,2.5448,3.2113,0.0089,0.0033,7.6514,5.829,0.8177,2.7806,2.2189,3.9392,0.0001,1.3129,4.0774,0.2851,0.6576,7.2647,0.6784,4.7652,5.9669,4.4465,2.7052,5.0114,1.0321,3.8659,1.1489,4.6351,1.3697,0.0135,2.5823,1.0117,0.0008,0.7191,8.2358,5.5052,0.0021,5.7878,6.8834,0.4887,0.2253,4.6535,0.442,0.0696,0.0086,4.5253,2.366,1.3582,2.1798,3.4669,1.0373,2.8521,0.3574,0.6239,5.0361,0.4721,5.3002,4.803,4.4722,0.5272,1.1807,3.0754,6.2328,0.2498,7.7876,4.3883,0.1914,4.2586,3.7819,3.7722,8.6112,0.03,2.4981,0.7599,4.577,0.5763,6.6378,0.5436,0.0012,3.4904,6.0988,9.7658,4.5435,5.0197,4.3144,1.2495,2.8742,0.0106,0.0326,5.6913,6.4151,3.5787,1.4148,4.7689,2.8575,0.9548,7.1297,2.8417,0.1449,3.0043,6.2231,0.0221,2.9699,4.1558,0.002,0.0238,1.7284,1.2852,1.9687,2.8986,4.7043,4.913,0.0301,5.102,8.8849,2.7006,3.3117,4.3221,5.443,2.3651,7.1681,4.5487,5.4168,3.8612,5.1346,6.4486,0.5551,0.7733,0.0002,3.2976,1.5421,0.0075,0.0099,2.1023,3.6254,0.844,1.0889,9.8608,5.5445,2.3603,1.5814,0.0021,0.3303,3.9833,3.5284,3.4839,5.2348,0.355,2.1631,1.035,5.9193,0.1116,5.5453,0.6392,5.8901,9.0591,0.0771,1.8684,2.7241,0.0006,0.0027,0.9703,0.1135,0.0016,0.0039,5.091,4.1227,0.9064,2.2363,8.0114,8.4671,7.9665,1.8721,4.8804,0.009,0.008,2.2764,1.5622,3.1191,0.5052,0.7095,8.8616,3.7155,1.0418,6.3501,4.1452,2.0615,0.0009,4.8656,1.2438,5.5305,0.0001,5.4423,8.2424,5.298,0.0012,3.4099,4.6904,4.5653,3.6522,6.3853,2.5745,5.047,0.9293,0.0003,0.7464,1.8141,0.3325,0.2148,1.8902,4.2461,1.3237,1.2616,0.3516,0.1785,0.0019,0.7296,4.2309,1.456,1.1676,0.0002,2.6052,0.7915,0.0064,0.0091,1.6768,1.4953,4.4579,0.2419,4.3421,4.5156,0.4134,0.7007,1.7492,0.0064,1.8786,1.5117,3.4086,0.3492,1.5469,3.901,1.8909,2.2844,0.0008,0.004,1.867,5.3759,7.8246,0.0089,0.0097,0.6317,2.1455,0.1628,7.7816,3.0598,0.2887,2.1383,1.4286,3.9219,1.642,6.2357,2.0549,1.2785,0.0005,1.0883,2.572,4.1628,4.4044,2.4629,4.387,5.8219,3.4723,3.1872,2.0512,1.0041,5.7207,0.2364,1.8331,3.2101,1.5324,4.5756,2.9821,1.9626,0.559,3.5373,2.9199,4.3588,1.4333,0.8309,1.4671,1.6281,6.0481,1.2922,2.1801,1.2417,1.4428,0.0032,0.2445,5.4798,6.9441,4.431,1.1154,6.1075,1.9421,0.9649,5.1599,0.069,1.0858,4.2843,0.013,0.0119,2.4904,3.2515,0.0669,2.7878,3.8301,5.0173,0.925,5.9819,0.5938,2.5518,2.1251,0.4274,8.1583,0.1569,0.0186,6.641,1.5038,4.8131,3.5786,3.4058,4.2093,0.613,4.6326,1.5832,0.5303,0.4565,6.7518,3.6881,9.3463,0.5025,1.2266,3.9229,8.1981,0.0949,4.2215,3.4317,6.1795,7.1459,4.604,1.6586,3.6971,0.5219,1.0767]}
{"id":861,"ended":true,"length":552,"text":"Primarily a grazer, the oribi prefers fresh grasses and browses occasionally. Grasses can constitute up to 90 % of the diet ; preferred varieties include Andropogon, Eulalia, Hyparrhenia, < unk >, Paspalum, Phalaris, Phalarion and Panicum. The oribi inhabits arid, dry country, such as salt flats, the open plains of Africa, the dry valleys of Arabia, and the arid regions of southern Europe. The oribi has a seasonal cycle and may spend considerable time away from its burrows. It emerges into the open during the day and makes its burrow later in the evening. The burrow is often small only 0.5 m (0.18 ft) deep but often extends 0.65 m (2.1 ft) or longer. The burrows may overlap in parts or may be connected by tunnels.\n\nReproduction: The oribi's breeding season begins in August and runs through the winter (November - February ). At this time of year there may be as many as 100 mating sites occupied by the bird. Mating often occurs in a loose group. During mating and for up to 9 weeks afterwards, the female bird is in heat and may produce up to 1 egg. The oribi nest is constructed out of grasses, which are laid in a flat shape (5 cm [2.0 in] or wider end upwards), at a minimum depth of 3 cm (1.2 in) and covered by plant leaves and other loose material. When the nest is almost completed, the female leaves the oribi at home, and takes the egg to a different site (often nearby ) where she leaves it in a dry, sheltered place. The young are fledged in three to five weeks.\n\nNesting: The female burrows a nest with a flat bottom, leaving it open at the top. She makes the burrow deep. When the burrows are made, they are left open on the outside to aid in ventilation. The egg is laid on a flat, roundish grass. The oribi is often mistaken for a snake because of its shape.\n\nBehavior: The oribi feeds between dawn and dusk, mainly near the edge of the desert. It visits the water periodically. The oribi's diet consists primarily of grasses (80 % ) followed by fruits (10 %) and seeds (5 %).\n\nStatus: Once thought to be an endangered species, its numbers are now much better known. Numbers in the wild have decreased by 80 % since the 1970s, but populations of wild-caught orchards have increased. In the latter cases the oribi's preferred habitats (and thus the number of oribis) have increased. The current population is estimated as ranging between 3 and 10 million individuals. Some are killed each year by vehicles, although it is thought this may be decreasing. The overall population decline may be due to the oribi's natural desert habitat. The oribi's habitat continues to be affected by development.","token_len":644,"entropy":[8.6181,2.7685,12.9533,0.7104,1.1408,2.2804,7.7538,10.4283,2.7371,6.4463,5.8572,3.5695,1.3148,1.3689,13.0633,4.5216,8.8179,0.8452,8.1065,1.67,2.8163,9.9693,2.9259,0.001,2.9007,5.3948,0.0616,0.6677,3.1886,9.1782,12.8984,4.0189,1.1059,8.6064,4.8826,2.4008,0.0804,1.4917,5.2578,4.7813,5.2294,0.2871,6.4404,8.2445,6.0864,4.9968,1.4448,0.2734,11.0852,10.452,6.8192,5.8573,2.8969,4.049,7.363,2.6933,3.0982,0.5238,4.9487,3.2846,4.1306,0.3602,4.0192,2.0589,3.1562,3.5724,2.7934,11.1055,4.9476,0.4358,2.0762,2.3522,0.1413,0.0544,7.4904,0.0778,6.2954,0.166,2.7389,2.4779,5.1483,1.9736,5.8164,0.0379,8.1249,2.4137,0.6717,4.9303,6.262,1.4622,1.8268,4.0737,0.6712,1.6541,4.4645,3.6424,0.2057,4.8685,0.5197,1.06,0.7327,3.9381,0.06,3.4374,0.1167,4.792,2.1233,0.3266,1.6001,1.3688,0.0217,0.0313,4.302,1.4393,8.3861,3.8227,3.7396,3.8052,5.4175,6.1502,0.2671,6.5731,0.0318,3.0076,6.4647,0.5122,0.8881,2.4433,6.7849,5.0531,0.9352,3.6225,2.8654,0.5533,2.8251,1.2373,5.55,0.9079,4.795,1.2745,6.6233,0.5191,0.0287,2.323,0.4845,1.5616,3.9362,0.3845,1.1337,3.6417,5.4641,7.7623,6.2965,0.7101,1.1422,2.0423,3.1107,2.5581,0.034,6.3071,0.9516,0.5201,2.8318,4.793,4.2942,3.7788,4.7171,0.0648,5.8485,0.1826,0.1212,2.9799,0.6821,3.4429,0.0269,0.2267,3.0099,3.5457,0.4102,1.249,1.6046,3.2138,3.3358,6.5154,2.728,7.9908,3.9251,2.3964,0.845,5.4422,0.8023,4.3926,1.086,3.9246,0.0018,6.8068,0.1254,0.0839,3.3232,1.6635,0.7664,0.0198,0.0244,3.9454,5.4749,1.2527,1.4023,0.9691,3.643,1.2549,3.9101,1.6741,2.3501,1.919,4.9769,3.7966,3.2067,2.0383,4.4914,5.1045,1.3529,0.4207,2.981,0.2028,4.7515,3.1641,0.057,2.6477,0.399,0.049,3.1596,6.7477,6.9826,8.1572,0.8222,1.0743,6.3956,0.5293,5.6554,0.0732,6.3473,1.3585,1.4171,2.9064,6.7234,3.0715,2.7604,3.3515,2.8913,5.1191,4.4117,7.8319,0.027,5.9284,2.239,4.9968,0.8723,0.8009,2.4387,5.5832,2.4725,5.1421,5.9563,1.15,3.4803,5.0119,3.2086,0.0019,2.7871,2.7942,1.3057,1.5131,2.7683,0.022,0.0079,5.9556,3.0951,6.3955,4.6444,0.0212,4.6739,2.6068,1.3547,3.5401,1.1133,4.484,1.8074,1.5432,4.8826,5.9744,3.8625,6.2931,2.7307,6.6075,2.1599,0.9547,3.9638,0.3679,0.5163,4.4366,4.8623,10.2081,8.7803,2.4532,4.7404,1.9911,4.2542,2.8146,0.0754,2.8241,0.7603,0.2837,1.5193,0.2061,2.6949,0.6501,0.7259,1.0714,4.6111,1.557,7.0936,3.8796,2.6787,3.9333,6.8398,3.1884,0.2508,4.1989,0.8605,2.6582,0.4071,7.0702,3.5999,0.4166,0.4938,1.7534,5.9228,1.5247,3.1275,0.0142,0.0059,4.8956,5.7485,1.8357,1.9893,5.3454,1.966,2.8174,1.8124,2.4572,4.6322,2.4632,3.2802,4.3393,7.4607,7.1213,1.957,1.6462,6.079,1.1849,2.4869,1.1809,4.119,1.7696,5.708,1.6035,0.775,1.2828,3.8297,1.7774,8.1109,0.0305,2.6269,5.4584,2.3201,1.6015,1.2578,1.5266,1.8233,0.0004,5.7037,0.9824,2.123,0.9013,2.8658,4.5776,0.1576,4.4213,4.0348,3.6673,1.6265,6.1465,4.8226,1.7835,5.6712,4.8759,1.2457,2.9513,1.6916,3.0141,1.39,2.3474,4.8168,2.9626,1.6234,0.1057,4.9001,4.9625,2.9987,0.8987,1.8285,2.5516,0.375,5.1719,1.0439,2.7858,0.7437,5.1025,1.1213,3.9288,1.0289,3.5132,3.3395,6.5789,0.8403,5.1148,0.6041,1.3063,4.5923,1.2685,0.8544,2.1621,1.4093,3.1518,2.5021,4.8882,7.1893,7.8396,2.8079,1.053,2.1382,0.0276,0.0106,2.45,4.2527,5.3349,0.052,0.6748,6.1015,3.4696,0.9619,0.5035,3.5129,1.1659,1.8429,0.0003,3.726,0.6838,0.2254,0.7672,0.5964,0.0123,0.0056,4.662,7.6342,5.578,0.1058,0.1449,1.7147,5.8694,6.9539,1.4043,6.3257,0.0277,0.6575,4.7541,0.9583,1.6877,6.7046,1.4325,5.6698,6.6126,2.0738,1.4952,1.3333,0.0142,0.0042,3.033,2.7393,0.6518,2.3754,0.0119,1.5324,0.4484,2.9554,9.0074,1.7607,3.8897,4.7737,0.0328,4.8192,1.6703,2.1297,0.2268,3.7686,0.4727,3.8214,0.1807,1.6201,0.0699,0.6316,2.6609,0.0004,6.2219,0.1457,6.2648,8.9626,0.7562,0.2578,3.4634,2.3594,0.2331,0.3437,4.7513,2.0464,2.165,1.6249,5.1461,3.8314,3.408,0.9714,7.7896,2.9576,0.9693,0.638,0.7731,3.1839,1.6468,3.9448,0.4098,1.2782,1.2376,1.8993,0.1072,1.4338,1.4773,5.3631,2.4363,4.0085,4.6443,1.4969,0.1047,4.9029,4.5659,3.04,1.6075,1.0093,3.1567,2.6234,1.4336,7.0149,3.9562,1.7444,1.3832,0.0159,0.0079,2.99,7.6579,3.7232,4.5893,5.0512,4.1209,1.8851,4.9678,0.1337,4.0749,0.7645,2.8956,0.8177,0.821,2.3896,0.924,1.7287,5.2443,1.3818,1.3659,1.3406,5.2835,7.5519,1.795,3.4881,1.9692,2.1126,1.4117,3.5092,0.5595,5.4638,4.7272,4.8078,4.8627,0.0476,2.1605,10.0283,1.3568,4.5349,3.4428,0.3149,2.7533,2.9796,1.9596,0.6471,7.2366,0.7953,1.7118,6.6477,1.1907,4.6859,3.1821,0.4834,0.7322,0.1388,1.7099,5.6025,0.0382,0.0788,0.5594,4.999,8.9184,2.1165,1.8676,1.9739,1.2693,0.0127,0.035,1.9082,2.7933,7.5652,0.0352,1.2771,3.4732,0.0656,6.0363,2.0609]}
{"id":80,"ended":true,"length":583,"text":"Several courtyards to the east and west of the main cave are blocked, though there is a 17 m ( 56 ft ) -wide courtyard that is accessible by entering the eastern part and exiting the center on the north side.\n\nIn addition a separate entrance to an underground, natural water source has been discovered on the south side of the cave ( Figure 14 ).\n\nThis well is of interest because it provides fresh water for those persons living at the southern end of El Mural.\n\nIn addition, it permits entry from the west into this water.\n\nIt is located 2 meters ( 7 feet ) from the south side of the cave, and only two meters from the surface of the ground ( Figure 14 ).\n\nThe ground below the surface has not been mapped but is most likely to be swampy clay.\n\nDue to the fact that the well is natural, we advise that it should only be handled by experienced people that are familiar with water wells.\n\nA pit and several palm fronds have also been discovered on the right south side of the cave.\n\nThese are likely to have been used for storage of grain or for keeping dry.\n\nStones, some pieces of pottery, and several tools have been found in the vicinity of this pit ( Figure 14 ).\n\nA pit that was dug in the western part of the north wall of the main cave has been discovered ( Figure 15 ).\n\nIt is estimated that this pit contains artifacts of both pre- and post-Columbian nature.\n\nThe opening for the opening to the pit is situated on the northern side of the wall of the cave.\n\nThe wall along the north side of the cave has been divided into three chambers by the use of adobe bricks.\n\nThis structure was utilized by the ancient occupants of El Mural, as a way to conserve materials, and to create more living space in the cave.\n\nA stone tablet (a large piece of stone with a hole cut through its center ) has been found at this location ( Figure 17 ).\n\nThis artifact indicates the presence of ancient inhabitants of this region.\n\nOne of the main findings from the area investigated by archaeologists is a series of stone tools.\n\nMost of the tools are broken or broken at the tip, meaning that they would have been used for cutting wood.\n\nIt is believed that these rock picks were obtained from the natural rock formations in the surrounding areas.\n\nThere is also a large number of small pieces of pottery discovered that are believed to belong to the ancient occupants of the cave.\n\nIt is likely that some of these pottery pieces were used to cook.\n\nThis makes the cave habitable in various seasons.\n\nFinally, archaeological artifacts from the past years have been identified in the eastern part of the cave by means of the analysis of the ground, which was tested by several

{"id":3045,"ended":true,"length":625,"text":"During the summers of the mid @ - @ 20th century, parents in the US and Europe dreaded the annual appearance of poliomyelitis ( or polio ), which was commonly known as `` the disease of the neck \". The crippling disease attacked children, resulting in physical and mental impairment. It was contracted primarily from contact with an infected person, such as a family member, or from an excreted infected stool ( 1 ). Although symptoms were initially subtle (i.e. fever, loss of muscle strength, and paralysis, especially around the neck ), the disease progressed rapidly into a crippling, if not fatal, illness ( 5 ).\n\nAlthough the disease was transmitted to humans only through stool ( 5 ), human patients were infected primarily by inhaling infected droplets. Once in the respiratory system, the virus infected cells of the airways, producing multiple copies of itself ( 5 ). Most infected cells then died, preventing the virus from establishing more than a minor infection ( 1 ).\n\nIn general, most infected children were asymptomatic, but more than one-third contracted a severe infection ( 5 ). The disease was usually caused by a strain of polio that spread rapidly throughout the blood ( 6 ). In severe cases, the virus invaded the brain, disrupting the nervous system ( 6 ). The disease could induce a persistent paralysis in which the muscle tissue at the site of the infection would atrophy, leading to the inability to move the cervical spine upward ( 7 ). If left untreated, the virus would eventually attack the spinal cord, causing total paralysis, which remained permanent ( 7 ).\n\nOnce the disease was stopped, the virus was not eliminated ( 7 ). The ability to spread in the blood was due to the release of a protein by the virus, which was also responsible for infecting and killing lymphocytes ( 7 ). The release of the protein was a sign that the organism was growing ( 7 ).\n\nThe outbreak of the disease in the 1940\u2019 s forced the eradication of it by a large-scale vaccination program. During this period, the virus was killed with an antiserum, and given to patients who had not yet been vaccinated ( 1 ).\n\nThe development of the polio vaccine, through the process of trial and error, was a long task and would be plagued by many setbacks ( 1 ). A year long trial followed by thousands of tests were conducted to find the optimal, most safe vaccine candidate. Once it was found that the vaccine was indeed effective and safe, a large-scale production of it could be conducted ( 1 ).\n\nWhile the process of finding a satisfactory vaccine had been plagued with many complications, the trials which followed proved that vaccines could be used as the primary method to prevent polio. While the vaccine did not eradicate it completely, it greatly reduced the incidence of the disease ( 1 ). However, with increased travel around the world the rate and incidence of polio had begun to rise in the 1950\u2019 s and 60\u2019 s ( 1 ). As a result, the vaccine needed to be updated to keep up with the new viral strains that the vaccines failed to protect against. In recent years, the vaccine has been improved to better address modern viral strains ( 1 ).","token_len":645,"entropy":[1.9437,10.1849,1.4791,2.5298,4.3492,14.7194,7.303,5.2295,3.4868,2.595,0.4225,0.7809,9.3357,3.4026,1.8766,2.5173,2.3219,2.7536,10.1595,1.5205,7.3413,5.9087,0.0429,10.2269,2.8083,0.1757,0.0136,0.0136,2.8477,9.3541,3.8374,2.5004,2.3912,1.8596,5.8312,3.3133,0.2671,8.9143,7.0683,4.2613,1.2501,0.6259,6.2697,2.5178,2.318,7.9877,2.0165,8.8133,3.1695,2.8943,4.8092,0.0155,6.5191,0.7035,0.8184,3.3685,1.0552,2.9078,1.0851,6.6418,4.9613,2.0634,5.9183,0.2042,4.4461,0.5104,0.6466,1.6017,4.2507,0.0046,1.3941,5.2145,0.1161,0.93,2.1268,1.6403,2.514,7.5949,3.0282,1.3966,5.5516,4.9498,3.1366,7.7166,0.3906,3.5658,5.2511,1.5961,5.7507,6.0384,2.5912,2.9867,0.0029,0.0037,2.6342,4.4068,0.3666,5.8699,0.0082,4.49,4.2239,0.4262,2.1465,4.5454,3.0076,4.4787,5.1076,0.3209,1.9387,2.4966,1.7573,1.6874,2.8326,1.699,4.03,2.4898,6.1405,2.2223,5.423,1.0222,0.5387,0.1441,2.8638,2.6387,5.3763,0.4219,2.0309,0.0046,3.9577,1.7838,2.5309,1.4167,3.667,2.4252,1.7604,4.2362,1.7256,7.4452,2.4709,2.8831,0.1741,4.8637,4.497,2.032,2.5868,5.9344,1.5523,5.3237,0.9501,3.9704,4.8486,0.1213,2.7986,5.5076,3.1761,0.6294,4.4542,2.1334,0.1785,1.0997,2.3158,4.4412,5.1917,3.6596,0.167,4.421,0.3272,1.9609,4.7607,6.7232,5.0783,0.1142,4.4153,1.6853,1.6775,0.3492,5.6371,4.4776,1.7749,3.0801,2.3671,1.4907,7.2144,1.152,3.4635,0.0618,5.417,4.9102,2.8868,0.9346,4.8691,1.9611,1.5216,3.5594,0.2309,1.2429,0.0002,2.5313,5.3958,0.0358,4.5868,5.2362,3.5294,2.0305,6.8978,0.0268,0.0,0.0002,1.7442,1.9104,4.959,1.3208,2.3676,2.0307,0.3997,6.4839,4.7713,3.0241,3.0714,1.32,1.8024,0.2508,2.3669,2.3427,1.3969,4.3296,4.2428,0.0982,1.7458,7.0125,0.1156,3.7975,2.038,3.2671,2.6593,3.0508,0.411,6.2177,3.5092,2.114,0.3887,2.5793,5.5229,0.073,0.1407,1.3078,1.6687,6.3641,0.5621,2.1189,1.1066,6.8628,1.1244,3.7071,0.0547,1.6503,1.6801,0.3136,2.3471,2.1439,3.4468,7.0178,2.6181,5.5217,4.2172,2.2989,6.6063,0.6193,6.1064,3.6375,6.1941,0.1396,3.8037,0.0735,1.7176,0.7546,2.8102,5.3619,0.0005,1.1907,1.7186,0.0185,3.1356,4.1146,0.2468,0.9091,2.8151,8.1186,1.1162,6.9295,1.4142,0.7388,0.109,5.4919,4.1347,0.0505,0.1011,0.7312,2.3242,2.3988,2.4547,5.0239,0.4165,2.1691,0.0689,1.243,1.0893,7.9731,0.1122,2.4683,2.8566,7.6486,2.4957,1.4598,1.1308,0.1373,0.4935,0.0002,5.6836,1.168,1.5845,1.0817,6.1922,0.4445,1.318,3.6616,1.616,3.8243,4.8592,3.175,1.8433,0.1907,2.1169,6.1303,0.5395,3.0237,4.0414,0.9178,1.8779,1.3562,5.5389,0.3279,0.997,6.247,0.0235,1.6882,2.4032,5.713,0.4507,2.8417,1.7937,1.4969,2.1079,3.9915,2.4132,0.0017,5.571,0.0189,5.6179,1.4347,5.2753,0.7377,0.7609,1.8329,0.1131,1.713,3.4895,0.0978,0.8098,0.4273,1.815,3.1668,4.0496,1.2344,0.4479,5.232,0.5717,4.2176,2.3863,0.6971,0.2404,1.1034,0.0002,1.839,6.5268,0.7784,1.6895,1.2178,1.8386,0.8741,4.7278,15.9368,8.4565,6.1044,7.3595,0.7938,6.1589,0.0007,0.0398,7.1099,2.4584,3.7376,3.6559,2.1341,0.0013,2.5514,0.7626,2.0708,3.9202,1.4096,0.9829,0.1425,1.6371,2.9409,0.8448,5.6912,4.916,3.4684,5.6244,4.2763,0.0749,1.9512,2.2868,8.467,0.8281,3.997,1.7417,1.403,2.6041,2.6069,1.2365,1.1569,1.0567,2.5296,0.1645,1.7366,0.0002,1.7658,5.3947,0.0582,1.5759,1.197,0.4426,2.9237,5.9442,1.3885,7.1526,0.0259,7.5629,0.6348,0.004,0.1697,1.8774,2.4887,4.8385,8.5299,3.8451,6.3395,2.8422,6.3443,0.2728,2.7909,4.4593,1.1796,0.9589,0.4852,3.9824,6.1219,7.7195,1.7671,4.0718,3.0404,6.3799,0.0343,6.0155,4.2607,1.6119,2.1899,4.7918,1.4039,3.3846,6.7571,1.8818,5.4247,1.6208,6.9659,1.0171,5.9131,3.5691,0.3778,2.4196,1.2693,0.6656,0.8343,0.9321,6.74,1.8687,3.1,0.6283,0.3218,2.9764,3.1789,1.8098,0.0021,5.1168,1.5484,3.3139,4.5769,0.6933,3.5674,1.4156,0.6864,0.2394,0.6468,0.0002,5.1887,1.0944,6.4869,0.2307,5.4289,1.4039,7.9584,0.613,4.134,0.8993,6.1445,2.2682,2.8058,4.7931,0.5423,1.2642,5.7188,5.3251,0.6284,3.4204,1.3878,4.7157,2.0093,0.6132,2.1139,3.8109,4.168,2.115,3.7424,2.4807,1.2571,0.9393,1.3894,4.6655,1.301,1.6611,3.4585,0.3761,4.0049,5.1969,2.9708,0.1733,0.8255,4.3623,0.7765,0.2621,2.1774,0.0942,1.5393,0.154,1.3753,0.7217,0.2026,4.4025,0.0051,4.7937,5.5878,7.114,5.8896,0.1306,0.2911,5.6097,4.1922,5.4537,4.0239,0.0319,0.9357,3.8693,4.809,0.0202,2.8769,3.5567,1.3757,3.3573,3.3943,0.0578,0.2424,3.304,4.9325,0.7245,0.0114,0.0159,2.8112,0.362,0.2898,4.3834,0.9684,0.1045,0.2416,1.1865,2.5692,7.0758,0.3909,0.1327,6.0582,1.7729,4.9041,0.4627,0.0759,0.8779,3.265,7.0258,2.8434,3.3939,4.0891,4.053,6.8501,0.0213,3.6909,0.0394,0.8947,2.9853,5.8812,0.1468,0.2886,1.2279,2.1755,0.8148,0.89,4.2292,1.6066,4.4062,5.2047,7.9756,3.5797,1.8493,1.5796,0.4338,0.2797]}
{"id":1086,"ended":true,"length":623,"text":"In the colonial United States the nuclear family was the most common family form. Typical families consisted of five or more children initially ; because of high infant mortality rates, only a few young women were expected to live past their first child, and a much smaller proportion of Americans, including women, were likely to survive until the age of 30. It was unusual, if not impossible, for mothers to be paid a wage, and women did not work outside the home. The nuclear family was the basic unit of society and the primary model for the formation and nurturing of children. The family was held to be the social unit and was expected to be both \u201ctight\u201d and stable, with the family members working together to achieve their goals. This assumption led fathers and mothers to place more value on work to provide for the needs of their children; in other words, work played a far more important role in the development of adults than it did for earlier generations, and marriage and parenthood were more oriented toward increasing personal and family economic security than they were toward providing the love and care of children.\n\nFamily structure gradually became more diverse with the expansion of work outside the home and the increased time spent away from and away from the family. At the same time, marriage increasingly became a less reliable institution. For instance, in the United States, half of all marriages end in divorce (compared with 12 percent of all marriages before 1960), although almost all of these divorces are not mutually agreed upon. While mothers spent more time with their married sons and daughters when they were younger, they also spent more time working outside the home at the time that they grew up, which led many to be away from home at an earlier age. Furthermore, by the time young adults reached the marriageable age, their attitudes toward children, work, and marriage had become much more \u201cprogressive\u201d than before. While older people still believed that marriage was \u201can ideal form of love relationship\u201d and that children \u201cneed protection and affection,\u201d they were far more likely to accept the idea of working and having a career first and then becoming a parent.\n\nIn the United States, most women initially married in their late teens or early 20s, and only a few married before they were 20. The average age at first marriage for women remained within the late teens or early 20s until 1930. However, as women gained professional and economic independence and a greater voice in the social sphere, they began to marry later and later. In the early 20 th century, in fact, fewer than one in four young women married within six years of her first birth. By 1970, more than half of all young women were not married. On the other hand, the average age at which men married had continued to increase from the early 20th century into the early 20 th century, before decreasing again starting in the mid-20 th century. Furthermore, this decline was not an equal trend among men and women; young men married earlier than young women almost every time. As a result, families in the U.S. today have much less stability than they did two hundred years ago (or two hundred years before that).","token_len":646,"entropy":[2.6222,11.1385,6.6375,0.0309,3.7091,9.9365,4.7817,0.9138,2.3253,2.6119,3.5978,1.6215,6.2469,1.5844,9.3969,2.5674,2.7497,0.0415,4.0062,1.9382,1.4834,0.9268,9.7189,10.2022,7.8914,1.0302,6.1334,3.5298,0.0426,0.806,0.8667,4.3723,2.1609,0.8609,5.9021,2.9965,1.5078,5.3237,0.0238,2.8739,4.9172,1.4692,3.0513,2.1319,2.7516,0.8687,3.4363,5.0385,0.7592,1.7177,0.7328,7.8025,4.9253,3.4327,1.9563,1.7824,1.0941,4.2305,0.0942,4.6013,4.6915,2.2647,0.4143,0.0047,2.6982,0.481,4.7263,0.8198,6.5606,2.7737,5.0812,0.0506,2.3873,0.1127,0.1858,4.5167,0.1628,3.1613,6.0624,3.6111,4.2686,2.1943,1.4116,3.5362,3.9837,0.2261,4.324,5.1033,0.5228,0.1515,1.2762,2.0734,4.1694,0.0814,1.0229,2.7145,5.3977,2.4109,0.1912,3.0653,2.4036,2.2782,3.3597,6.1428,1.0218,2.0413,4.5285,2.1102,7.5709,0.0168,2.9352,0.5409,1.8677,2.9789,1.3503,6.3683,2.6916,1.4691,1.3085,5.5241,1.8722,2.6353,2.4947,4.5117,0.0944,1.533,6.2095,15.5818,8.2591,11.1177,5.4553,6.0646,1.0858,3.3577,2.4561,2.3616,2.1229,3.1036,2.7758,4.0954,1.0466,1.2251,4.0744,2.6793,1.674,0.4967,3.7769,5.6989,3.0976,7.0882,2.0413,0.356,0.1728,5.8357,2.9333,3.4649,0.0776,4.8472,5.9943,3.2668,1.0063,1.4974,4.1016,0.0399,1.0647,0.3271,4.8788,3.2496,2.7099,0.0088,0.129,3.3836,6.622,0.5275,6.0873,1.5173,0.2189,0.1048,0.2526,1.5471,2.1341,0.2184,8.0525,0.9739,3.3307,0.3618,1.6148,9.6362,0.7288,2.8855,1.1225,7.5556,1.8548,7.2272,0.0006,0.8169,3.3439,9.4964,0.767,5.1982,4.4189,2.1278,1.2917,5.3968,1.4564,2.0777,2.1399,0.715,0.406,4.2934,3.6418,8.6559,0.6067,2.2908,1.3865,0.8193,0.1999,1.9758,0.0024,5.2187,2.3508,7.5399,2.4561,0.7865,5.0407,3.8048,1.1533,4.9997,0.0491,6.4679,6.3371,0.3473,0.0625,1.8056,1.1992,4.6224,6.4485,1.0109,3.7598,0.0862,7.4842,3.4068,0.0066,1.8628,1.3643,0.6061,4.6302,0.8306,0.6204,0.0013,0.2257,5.9384,6.4455,1.3839,1.8142,4.1097,4.6308,4.4942,2.2251,4.4731,3.5786,0.0244,1.853,0.6448,2.2179,0.0313,0.8312,5.9345,0.1893,1.0573,1.5329,4.2962,0.2331,0.0499,3.6341,5.5494,0.0215,0.4175,4.6257,0.9213,1.7625,1.9754,0.3445,4.3889,3.9837,1.5243,4.3139,5.361,1.628,1.6471,1.0624,3.6715,0.0036,1.2666,3.3429,7.5775,3.9416,0.3649,0.6922,4.6377,5.9323,5.8139,1.3745,0.1251,1.1255,0.1599,8.8747,2.9232,1.0276,0.2124,5.2509,0.7844,0.7762,1.9918,0.6638,1.562,1.9738,1.1429,0.6611,0.0295,4.7969,1.5732,0.2776,0.0464,5.4172,1.6853,2.2933,4.1561,0.6336,5.3783,0.068,1.6019,3.1449,2.7861,5.3093,1.3518,4.0314,6.5752,0.2046,1.4554,2.2604,3.38,1.0418,0.1088,0.5227,4.9511,0.0009,4.8825,0.3815,1.9589,4.856,2.1396,1.554,1.5825,6.7012,2.8536,0.0932,1.5415,2.5664,6.5794,0.9753,4.3376,3.0749,4.0924,0.4179,0.2743,3.4955,0.9961,2.136,2.7331,0.2019,15.2236,0.2701,5.0794,0.5558,0.7049,0.8137,2.7775,3.8424,0.6531,4.102,4.8068,3.5245,5.3424,3.2593,0.5729,1.8917,0.3718,12.0231,0.0525,4.9558,3.5517,4.2421,0.1964,5.7812,9.8974,3.3076,5.4893,2.8243,1.7774,1.695,4.3151,0.0329,6.9274,7.7276,2.0676,4.2721,0.8038,8.0353,2.6107,2.1143,1.8966,4.0583,0.8845,1.1349,0.1548,3.8263,2.0401,2.1443,1.1762,4.7154,3.5559,4.0879,2.9108,4.9469,7.9933,1.8974,2.6973,3.2803,1.5542,2.325,1.0358,1.531,0.0001,2.6469,1.0938,1.1378,0.0312,0.3858,4.1923,3.0008,7.1267,2.8159,1.9453,1.5542,0.9858,0.9158,0.833,0.0507,0.8573,0.0859,0.9421,1.2677,3.3093,1.1132,1.5763,2.0413,3.126,1.8352,0.7421,3.5352,0.7199,2.5061,3.2456,0.3948,1.7775,0.6431,0.2217,1.8552,1.2146,6.8828,6.1273,0.3452,4.9871,1.7904,2.4574,0.1077,0.0457,0.0012,4.0575,7.7855,1.2258,2.7666,0.0019,3.3913,1.825,4.1926,6.932,1.7998,3.7157,2.2499,2.074,5.2831,1.5971,8.0253,0.1828,1.0223,3.9057,3.2766,0.1685,1.5012,1.4353,0.1947,2.9233,2.9433,2.2519,4.5534,1.2844,2.1135,1.2874,1.7754,1.7143,6.3814,0.076,0.1649,4.6012,3.2372,0.0086,5.0692,1.2439,1.6204,0.7045,1.8265,3.629,0.4066,2.081,3.8691,5.0004,0.5697,0.4054,5.89,0.9813,4.512,0.6036,3.3661,4.1758,0.1387,3.5166,0.0628,1.0667,0.2463,0.6171,1.0281,0.1442,2.1502,5.6306,0.5451,2.8032,6.4853,0.6131,0.2013,0.0137,0.0012,2.4342,2.3159,0.2504,0.694,4.6263,3.7727,2.3772,3.8223,4.4298,0.0525,1.0906,2.6714,2.2475,1.6273,2.0059,2.9513,0.0495,4.7062,0.0767,0.8495,1.1776,0.0927,0.0769,1.1405,5.5476,4.989,3.7202,6.5978,0.3543,0.3105,2.2247,0.2015,0.8715,0.3944,0.0509,0.2373,5.7962,0.0005,4.8873,2.9766,2.0747,2.6284,5.2929,6.6349,5.9139,3.7585,2.1926,0.5743,0.0405,3.4241,4.805,1.1034,3.3007,2.8731,1.1763,1.6681,0.0027,7.6637,4.1866,3.5324,1.348,3.7066,1.2141,0.1467,0.0733,6.8122,2.7512,0.759,4.5626,0.0021,0.003,0.0824,4.2357,2.6568,3.986,1.1495,4.0075,0.9685,1.1246,0.2117,4.7448,1.7433,0.3287,0.0372,3.9342,5.0855,4.2118,0.6536,0.656,2.4474,4.158,0.8325]}
{"id":469,"ended":true,"length":622,"text":"Prior to his senior year, Jeff Barker of The Baltimore Sun noted that Turner's strengths were `` poise, smarts, [ and ] toughness, `` while he had room for improvement in the area of his ability to get off the ball. Turner received three scholarship offers, all from Big Ten programs, from the time he was a freshman. His recruiting experience, however, was only through mail. ``I did get some calls,`` he said. ``I didn't get any mail. Maybe a note, if it was from a coach at one of the schools.... I haven't kept track and I don't know how many I got. Maybe 10 or two.`` Turner said he had plenty of contacts on the Indiana team that won the 1991 national championship because his grandfather, Bill Turner, coached at Purdue. He said those connections helped him get on the Purdue staff after his freshman year. He became a graduate assistant after the 1994 season and was promoted to run the offense in the middle of last season. Turner has been recruited both as a passer and a runner, although he prefers the former. ``I just want to do everything,'' he said. ``I know that Coach (Dave) Shula and Coach (Jim) Tressel love the passing game, but they like to run. I just want them to be happy.... I can really take more hits. I can get out of pocket. If it comes to it, I can throw a good ball. I think of myself as a quarterback. That's who I am. But being able to do both is important to me.`` Turner is one of at least five high school-level prospects who have reportedly joined the Indiana coaching staff.\n\n\"He has gotten a lot of recruiting mail and has been in contact with several schools, but said he has yet to make any firm commitments.\" Sounds like to me that the kid from Indiana has really got his head screwed on about what school and program is best for him. I give him credit for having his priorities in order.\n\nWhen I read that quote, my first thought was, \"Yeah, that sounds like Joe Tiller.\"\n\nAnd the next thing I know, they've committed to Cincinnati. Hmmmm. Now we're back to where we started.\n\n\"I just want them to be happy.... I can really take more hits. I can get out of pocket. If it comes to it, I can throw a good ball. I think of myself as a quarterback. That's who I am.

{"id":1896,"ended":true,"length":591,"text":"Common procedures in infertility treatment such as semen analysis and intrauterine insemination ( < unk > ) require collection of semen samples. These are most commonly obtained through masturbation, but an alternative to masturbation is known as sexual intercourse between a man and a woman. Another method of collecting semen is the use of a device, commonly referred to as a male ejaculator, which collects the semen from an internal channel. Typically, a female partner performs sexual intercourse on the man so that semen is forced into the male ejaculator. A second male ejaculator, connected to a syringe, delivers the semen to the female partner and onto her body.\n\nSexual transmission of HIV and other STIs from one person to another through sexual contacts is relatively rare. However, there are circumstances where it can occur. For example, if a man with an infectious STI uses a condom during intercourse with a woman known not to be infected with a disease and then ejaculates semen that he knows has been in contact with the condom ( e.g. in areas containing latex ), there may be a risk of transmission. The risk of transmission is very low. The risk of transmission is lowest if the man uses a condom that is not damaged and fits properly.\n\nMen who receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine are protected from some of the most serious forms of cervical cancer. A HPV vaccine has also been shown to prevent the precancerous cell changes that occur in cervical cancer. It has also been shown to benefit men of all ages. Men who receive the vaccine also have a greater likelihood of becoming infected with the CervicalNeoplasia and therefore the potential to transmit a cancer to a female partner. The HPV vaccine helps to protect men by preventing the transmission of the cancers.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe first step towards getting a diagnosis of ejaculation disorders, and then seeking treatment, is to book a confidential consultation. This consultation fee is payable directly to the doctor.\n\nThe time between making the appointment and it being scheduled should typically be no longer than 30 minutes.\n\nWe do ask that patients book their consultation up to 5 days in advance.\n\nA medical practitioner (a registered doctor or other medical professional) will then review the history and examine any relevant records. The medical practitioner will ask further questions to assess whether the patient is suffering from ejaculation disorders.\n\nIf ejaculation disorders are confirmed, the medical practitioner will then outline a treatment plan, which will include options for treatment, should they be necessary.\n\nThe cost of treatment for ejaculation disorders varies and is dependent on your GP surgery, your symptoms and how long you have been suffering. In the UK, different health insurance companies (and the National Health Service depending on where you live) offer a number of different treatment programmes for treating ejaculation disorders.\n\nDepending on the procedure used, there is a range of costs associated with the treatment. These costs could be anywhere from \u00a320 to \u00a310,000, and are subject to change. The best way to find out about how much it costs to treat ejaculation disorders would be to book a consultation and explain your symptoms.","token_len":646,"entropy":[10.6239,3.4001,10.0737,1.3424,6.1733,0.0047,7.0268,2.1699,1.3604,5.6474,0.12,0.0005,4.3753,0.0213,0.0017,2.8993,12.9356,10.3732,7.8434,5.7399,2.9715,5.3581,9.2236,0.2554,1.434,1.2795,2.3797,4.0477,2.6428,5.774,1.1224,1.5462,2.9484,8.8808,1.4355,1.7056,5.7209,2.0512,3.4514,3.4447,0.9446,5.9361,0.1711,5.4285,1.471,6.7311,1.7403,0.8138,0.0439,0.2065,0.0511,0.595,5.7841,1.2553,0.9967,3.6941,0.084,0.6198,3.1991,1.7337,0.0054,1.6791,5.7295,4.6912,4.4872,1.7536,0.0059,0.0221,0.6196,6.815,1.3084,3.3771,0.3351,1.4729,3.6008,2.2366,0.8444,1.2014,3.5908,5.7038,9.4576,2.3165,5.2225,0.4294,2.0902,3.2257,2.8897,4.0077,3.8763,0.0263,3.4362,0.9096,1.6997,6.7614,0.4352,3.3575,0.952,6.9865,1.3734,0.8266,3.1862,2.2157,0.4614,0.8209,3.1212,3.8138,3.7719,0.5445,0.2007,1.8202,8.5738,0.2969,1.0986,5.4803,0.0184,0.7143,5.1516,1.1506,0.3828,0.9057,0.3054,1.3974,0.1832,2.866,7.2873,2.3397,1.4676,0.4852,2.5388,0.0013,4.6086,6.8181,1.4807,5.2273,2.8677,1.3505,2.4021,1.1078,4.337,3.0132,1.3766,0.1304,0.0946,3.9354,1.9858,4.1825,1.297,4.2938,1.0778,0.8021,1.5604,0.0068,2.2113,0.5761,7.1673,1.2782,2.3404,2.55,0.9377,0.9752,2.2352,0.2021,0.0222,3.0868,1.0144,1.5835,5.2805,3.3667,5.5347,3.2631,0.0168,5.8684,1.4223,0.6467,3.3616,1.1635,2.848,0.7637,0.469,6.0525,7.2308,0.0459,1.1237,1.4617,1.3871,4.4757,4.7078,3.9151,3.9878,4.8801,0.003,2.9169,3.9806,3.606,3.6246,3.4529,1.0766,5.9557,1.5201,0.0099,1.4502,2.9936,3.9667,6.5476,0.214,0.0037,1.2916,3.3698,7.8932,6.5888,7.3326,4.088,3.5857,1.8032,0.0642,0.98,1.2789,0.4415,1.0272,1.5973,2.7634,1.3521,0.6449,0.3541,1.1336,3.7841,0.8395,2.5555,2.8208,1.191,0.3545,0.4195,1.0144,5.7416,2.201,0.7337,1.4626,3.0042,0.9754,0.2598,4.0973,0.9881,1.3282,7.4048,2.601,8.9843,3.3267,0.7898,1.5203,0.0002,6.4943,1.0169,4.5547,4.0168,6.5099,0.8229,0.0394,0.0347,0.0,0.0006,0.6105,0.0272,0.0002,0.0644,0.7212,2.0628,4.7109,1.1811,6.2363,2.4018,0.1314,1.3745,0.9405,2.6369,0.0125,4.1652,0.1206,1.1429,4.1062,5.9446,0.403,3.5975,4.2452,0.1021,0.8047,0.0196,1.9017,1.9676,8.8266,0.1005,0.0025,3.9013,7.3103,1.2076,1.5875,0.7954,2.7818,0.4254,1.1094,3.9441,1.9909,1.8084,0.1155,0.1746,0.4597,7.193,1.8573,4.1713,1.4498,0.1461,1.351,4.163,0.6309,0.949,0.8789,1.424,3.2867,0.8521,1.5047,3.2003,3.2027,0.0469,4.2498,1.6574,0.1967,2.0978,5.6891,2.8602,0.8882,12.0673,4.5047,0.7975,4.5756,6.7632,3.1649,4.5635,2.2393,2.7943,3.2841,5.055,2.1335,3.0449,3.0701,0.3484,0.3369,2.4784,2.3941,0.1164,5.777,1.9447,1.4034,1.7003,5.6674,0.7832,1.0038,3.1174,0.024,1.6682,5.2268,1.5352,0.9703,0.0002,4.9602,4.1838,2.5003,2.5224,0.0281,0.9651,0.235,0.0002,1.3568,5.549,2.348,4.2975,3.0132,1.7185,3.8725,0.3659,10.9314,0.6509,4.414,4.0868,3.1142,4.1011,6.3814,0.7308,0.8885,0.1432,0.6475,9.2965,0.7926,6.8453,1.6125,1.3065,2.5217,1.5586,7.9315,0.7087,3.426,3.8744,0.533,0.3101,4.1706,1.457,2.0012,0.0002,2.0032,6.9467,4.2499,5.7138,1.0633,0.7309,0.2436,7.3094,0.4586,5.165,4.1678,6.3639,0.2531,4.5947,3.2478,0.0191,2.6517,1.1822,0.3736,1.7588,0.0002,6.2352,3.0014,4.8908,0.5677,3.3662,6.9983,2.1071,1.5464,7.5104,0.4183,4.0567,0.6367,1.8584,0.0001,1.2362,1.0419,0.0002,4.114,4.8792,1.579,4.0792,4.3612,3.1845,5.507,1.4511,2.6746,2.1023,0.8968,0.6578,0.9737,3.9887,3.7643,0.5694,6.9599,1.5478,6.0599,3.113,3.7594,3.425,1.1651,2.4888,2.618,0.0788,0.4249,4.6224,7.0456,0.0538,1.9406,3.5424,1.806,0.9066,0.8336,1.4594,3.6948,0.0474,2.6646,0.2406,0.2993,0.7109,0.7148,0.0001,2.131,4.5508,0.0981,0.7043,0.5737,4.6386,0.5391,1.2873,2.1275,0.0289,0.3155,2.6356,7.5226,2.5553,2.3916,0.0816,2.8825,1.8492,1.4461,0.9398,6.8771,0.6327,1.4617,1.9294,7.5257,2.9335,2.1765,2.1219,0.2392,0.554,0.0002,2.1166,5.0021,0.4819,1.9585,2.2458,1.7659,0.0795,0.1079,2.6827,4.0574,1.8384,2.9877,0.2295,4.9179,8.151,7.8416,1.4103,2.6864,5.7879,1.3281,3.3694,2.6418,0.9067,0.5707,0.2405,5.8935,2.9425,4.2228,2.6841,1.3194,0.4285,8.3679,5.3116,2.3856,2.6654,4.2429,4.0777,3.0027,3.6286,0.6484,0.0955,6.9312,0.0455,1.9714,0.1931,0.3369,0.0784,1.8821,3.111,4.1996,0.002,1.2707,2.3074,6.0559,2.0219,4.1629,0.8053,0.0705,0.0426,0.2679,0.7758,0.0002,5.9979,0.0283,1.1607,5.4607,2.2576,0.4507,2.4821,2.192,1.1581,1.9438,0.0099,2.7276,2.0546,0.0352,1.5119,1.059,1.0255,3.5915,3.3807,5.0422,1.5043,4.4472,0.3655,0.5687,2.8122,0.8343,0.1268,5.644,0.4724,0.0564,2.6188,3.9917,3.2116,3.8832,0.0025,1.1858,1.3668,3.2293,4.4459,1.8236,0.0757,2.663,0.0764,2.3518,3.411,0.5671,3.2108,1.0804,1.3307,0.9974,2.0625,0.0169,0.0465,5.8295,0.0336,0.2302,4.0445,0.7335,0.4498,3.5164,6.458,1.5059,5.3466,1.1886]}
{"id":1650,"ended":true,"length":585,"text":"The meat of kakapo made good eating and was considered by M\u0101ori to be a delicacy and it was hunted for food when it was still widespread. One source states that its flesh ``had the texture and taste of pork''.\n\nIn New Zealand, kakapo were hunted mainly for their eggs, meat and shells. Today, they live in conservation programmes, with their numbers only increasing steadily. But now a new threat has emerged - the kakapo appears to have lost its natural defences from the herpes virus that killed millions of people in the 20th century.\n\nIn New Zealand, the disease, along with smallpox and measles, wiped out 99 percent of the human population between 1780 and 1840, but it is the only human disease that has managed to survive a century of human immunisation.\n\nThis week scientists reported that in rare kakapo disease cases in recent years, most victims succumbed to the virus within 24 hours of infection, and that in many cases the virus is spreading far and wide in areas containing both populations.\n\nOn Wednesday, New Zealand authorities confirmed the first death from the disease in five years in a 26-year-old male kakapo - named Whiterose - in the Kaikoura region of the south island.\n\nOn Thursday, two more deaths were confirmed, bringing the confirmed toll in the five years since the virus has re-emerged to 11.\n\n\"For the first time in many centuries kakapo populations are now under threat of this terrible virus, and this could be the only virus to which they would not have immunity,\" said the chief executive of the conservation group Guardians of the Kaikoura.\n\nNew research published in the New Zealand Medical Journal this week showed that the disease appeared capable of spreading more than 100km (62 miles) in the wild from infected birds.\n\nThe birds - found only in New Zealand and on the Chatham Island chain in the Pacific Ocean - were particularly susceptible to the virus.\n\nScientists are also warning now of potential risk to the New Zealand public due to infection in humans.\n\n\"While we're not at that stage in New Zealand, which may be 20-40 years, at the moment it is not impossible, and it's something that needs to be looked at,\" said Mike Brown, director of the department of veterinary microbiology at Auckland University.\n\nScientists said they were concerned because the virus can spread between humans by a common vector, which they have not yet identified. New Zealand is unlikely to see a widespread outbreak of the disease - fewer than 200 people remain alive in the country - but experts say it may be best to vaccinate all humans who may come into contact with sick birds.\n\n\"It is also reasonable to assume that the New Zealand public will require vaccinations with any vaccine that is licensed and available for influenza,\" scientists said in a review of current knowledge published in the New Zealand Medical Journal last year.\n\nScientists will now look into how the virus is transmitted. But they say the best chance for the birds - who may not survive a major outbreak - may be to restrict the areas in which they are released.","token_len":647,"entropy":[9.5832,2.8299,8.703,6.1969,2.1605,6.94,5.649,6.9108,3.1927,3.6249,5.0292,3.5671,7.3789,4.6766,0.0565,1.2221,0.1644,1.9828,2.7127,0.0056,3.1255,5.1734,0.8814,6.4029,2.1342,3.485,5.001,1.2,0.3039,5.2569,5.7315,1.138,5.1151,5.3113,4.3682,0.3179,5.5484,4.7926,15.6284,4.0117,3.0117,3.6479,2.5268,2.2786,0.1534,4.5101,3.3096,1.3831,0.0017,2.936,4.6833,0.0808,0.632,2.2627,0.0988,0.0198,3.96,3.3807,4.3201,1.0998,2.2261,6.5615,1.1953,3.5262,0.5926,4.6191,0.7168,6.0046,0.7719,2.0371,7.5258,0.7629,8.6859,5.0829,2.4845,3.5513,3.6019,6.3431,5.4257,0.8085,5.3415,0.9023,5.0425,5.5104,3.5925,2.0916,5.3373,2.4038,1.1535,2.9177,1.4853,3.4082,0.1078,0.0134,9.1488,0.1285,1.0768,4.176,0.5322,5.2711,5.5787,5.5369,1.8551,11.6005,0.5184,3.1264,4.9177,4.0088,0.1657,1.0531,0.918,0.6517,3.5701,0.036,0.278,0.1702,0.4178,0.0003,2.6088,2.9437,0.0091,0.367,1.5213,3.5575,3.2838,6.768,0.0013,6.6183,0.1038,0.8094,2.834,0.1398,5.0112,0.0225,7.0061,2.1951,0.0022,0.5915,4.9555,0.0612,1.8551,4.4381,3.3779,0.0379,4.9088,1.6004,2.291,2.307,1.8485,4.2613,3.2058,5.0069,0.8533,0.9849,1.1073,4.9287,0.0188,2.5303,4.0104,2.7998,2.4767,3.7655,6.0824,0.0561,0.3957,0.8707,0.0003,4.0868,4.3323,3.6168,3.3692,0.9243,3.9304,7.4711,10.0027,0.0438,0.0188,4.1704,2.1384,2.3396,6.3495,0.3243,0.7152,5.0542,3.5554,6.0767,0.1121,1.6407,0.9828,3.2846,2.8746,0.0462,1.283,1.4548,1.507,2.1784,2.6458,3.5711,3.1135,0.323,1.4047,2.0314,3.9634,4.4176,4.2942,2.4848,0.0451,3.3981,3.0412,6.9206,5.2001,5.0209,0.2163,0.3913,0.0003,5.5652,3.0082,0.5554,3.5007,0.009,4.0669,2.9709,1.9491,3.6645,4.2425,1.8995,1.0665,0.7376,0.9772,4.2186,0.1466,2.1395,1.3378,7.5923,0.1138,0.3128,0.1308,0.003,3.8301,2.3203,0.0107,0.005,5.0776,5.6165,8.0397,4.5966,2.1097,3.8042,2.2195,1.8722,7.7766,1.6076,1.0853,0.7469,2.1898,0.5887,1.9487,3.1391,4.6081,1.4656,0.7971,0.0002,5.2874,2.1923,0.4605,4.3897,2.6139,1.4541,0.6371,0.9247,2.9869,5.2039,0.2126,7.7554,5.929,2.7218,0.9453,4.8226,0.4998,1.7427,1.216,3.3871,3.9117,7.5496,1.4768,0.196,0.0026,3.2198,3.8204,0.5287,0.4016,0.0002,3.4077,5.2916,1.278,0.5702,0.0186,1.167,4.4392,5.5198,4.4781,0.0066,0.0137,4.6301,1.6714,3.272,3.1884,0.5128,2.3972,6.106,5.4495,1.7758,2.0937,1.3387,3.1736,4.668,1.4993,0.9429,4.6127,4.3319,2.1516,7.2185,2.4515,3.9279,3.0296,2.0837,7.8035,1.2986,0.6404,4.0052,2.9225,2.1974,0.0898,0.6214,5.952,1.2827,9.133,0.624,1.0399,2.5006,0.0232,0.0085,0.0024,0.9977,0.1549,0.0002,4.8636,6.9228,2.7715,0.6637,0.4989,3.8077,0.0889,2.6392,0.0616,4.0237,0.1334,3.0583,0.3313,1.6543,2.8921,6.6114,7.6748,0.0078,1.8575,4.8142,3.4745,2.2021,8.17,0.8819,2.5539,0.0551,0.0136,2.0898,2.8753,3.9068,3.0059,4.3317,4.6755,2.1852,0.4298,0.0002,1.8099,5.8682,4.7236,5.3612,2.3464,0.3924,3.498,0.0117,1.8494,4.8452,1.2902,7.4109,2.7792,2.8953,3.2716,3.3895,0.9843,3.3652,1.8215,0.2124,1.7982,4.1462,1.3403,0.2592,0.5226,0.68,1.2304,0.626,0.0002,3.9675,3.0992,2.9452,4.0994,7.8742,2.7611,4.5454,4.9925,0.8538,1.9937,4.3395,0.0517,4.0098,5.0583,0.0047,7.3927,2.8288,4.6618,1.0105,0.3961,0.0002,1.8882,4.6239,2.2568,4.0014,2.1438,3.0714,3.8297,1.91,2.9602,4.6558,0.0029,2.0907,5.995,4.6236,1.2392,6.6744,3.2629,3.0952,0.0897,4.5838,5.3799,2.1389,0.6658,2.0747,2.0057,3.2699,5.3004,2.8686,2.1872,2.0333,1.1465,4.0131,0.8572,4.5611,0.1119,0.1019,2.749,0.1297,1.2257,0.5187,6.5297,5.3894,0.2768,1.871,0.0575,0.629,5.8727,0.0703,5.194,5.0259,0.0052,0.2267,2.6786,0.8777,0.7049,0.1125,0.0002,5.0639,3.9498,2.4103,1.4172,2.4312,4.2461,1.6833,1.2429,2.6445,1.9474,4.7972,2.6146,4.5789,4.8904,4.9746,3.2252,1.3954,2.5185,3.4535,4.1857,2.0617,1.3666,1.2666,0.2441,6.1733,0.0126,1.7648,6.2673,0.0305,2.9467,2.0103,5.2393,0.5591,0.661,0.8208,0.7128,4.7492,8.6413,0.1297,3.7558,1.1238,5.6703,4.8929,1.5128,0.9436,1.4409,1.3319,1.8356,3.9685,2.1899,1.2253,3.0684,1.0546,7.3711,0.5276,6.0597,0.0024,2.9334,4.2067,2.3119,3.1515,4.1378,0.2803,0.0021,0.0045,6.3682,2.1369,0.5716,0.2288,0.0003,1.6298,2.1171,1.6697,4.251,6.5332,0.2229,1.1864,0.2474,2.2514,5.2687,0.0057,2.3916,1.3053,7.4411,3.8799,4.827,4.1426,3.7711,1.8881,1.5149,6.8853,2.2697,2.3993,2.4216,11.5758,2.8338,7.723,0.5379,1.9784,0.4095,7.6783,0.4678,4.7084,5.1361,3.0749,0.5915,0.5452,2.8753,0.052,0.2696,0.0141,3.3119,1.5526,0.0247,0.2457,0.0003,4.4123,4.4554,1.9708,3.1432,2.3556,2.2199,1.4584,0.6296,2.2379,2.1326,2.4294,4.0206,2.1522,2.7401,1.8781,3.8053,3.553,1.5999,2.5911,6.4216,4.2887,2.7625,3.6895,1.9875,2.9794,3.0627,5.1063,0.9885,0.3827,3.5057,0.3709,1.0314,7.6523,1.8104,7.0344,2.6204,0.1006,0.5571,1.8564,5.7338,1.0423]}
{"id":715,"ended":true,"length":614,"text":"The original Guitar Hero was released on the PlayStation 2 in November 2005. Guitar Hero is notable because it comes packaged with a controller peripheral modeled after a black Gibson SG guitar. Rather than have players strum or play individual notes on the guitar, the game relied on the player to complete a set of guitar riffs using two circular knobs on the bottom of the guitar. The game was released as four separate song packs for those with enough PlayStation 2 memory to accommodate them:\n\nThe game was later ported to the Xbox 360, the Wii and the Nintendo DS. The Xbox 360 version was developed by MTV Games and was ported to the Sony PlayStation 3 and the Wii U by Harmonix. The DS version had been built from the ground up as a video game and was programmed in the company's proprietary development engine, allowing for a greatly enhanced music experience on the platform. The software was re-released as a \" Greatest Hits Edition \" for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable on 2 January 2011.\n\nDespite its commercial success, Guitar Hero was criticized heavily for its simplified gameplay and difficulty curve. It was also criticized for the licensing of music from artists, or their estate, that have not given permission to be in the game. It was the subject of a lawsuit from BMG Rights Management where it filed a $600 million lawsuit against Activision as well as individual artists (such as John Bonham ) for the use of their music in the game. During the case, BMG and Activision agreed to an undisclosed fee so that Activision could continue use the game for its Guitar Hero: On Fire Tour series which featured many artists on the lawsuit that could not be included in a game.\n\nThough the game series went on to earn over $8 billion in sales and hold the record for the highest-selling game of all time by 2010, this made many fans of the original game angry that it had dominated the market as the sole musical video game for so long. This lead to an outcry from customers of the newest video game Guitar Hero World Tour, which did not feature the song \"Back in Black\" in any of its songs. Though it was later added to the game, it was one of four songs (including AC\/DC's \"Highway to Hell\" and Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\") that was used in the series to avoid a lawsuit from either party.\n\nAt least 1,600 guitarists were involved in the original production, including well known guitarists such as Slash, Dave Navarro and Buckethead. Since the beginning, players have been able to jam with themselves using the game's downloadable content, allowing for some creativity.\n\nThe video game is known for introducing the \"Guitar Hero phenomenon\" to the music gaming market, with the game being very popular with many groups of musicians such as music schools, bands, and people who play in front of audiences as an individual or as a solo act. The game was also an influential game during the creation of the Guitar Hero series, serving as a catalyst for the genre to come into existence. The game sparked a shift towards the use of real world instruments, rather than virtual instruments, in order to make better music games.","token_len":647,"entropy":[7.2326,10.3672,0.6385,2.3214,1.6147,1.8461,2.3067,2.5968,1.2907,0.7814,3.7781,3.858,0.8187,3.2796,0.0356,4.0633,6.8201,3.0354,0.8695,5.14,4.7786,0.4543,1.4469,4.4557,8.5488,8.5309,0.1099,1.9249,6.8736,7.6482,3.5003,4.3929,0.6502,7.7122,0.0363,4.1742,4.2303,7.5928,0.1262,5.019,2.1952,7.6134,0.7436,2.6716,0.6957,0.8093,0.4112,1.1493,2.8944,7.9352,0.357,2.0522,1.8706,1.6313,5.9762,1.3149,1.8895,0.1025,4.2268,6.2705,0.0487,3.3306,4.6356,8.9989,4.8199,0.007,2.4123,0.5837,3.7604,0.4013,0.2437,0.8674,0.3879,1.4949,2.1824,2.0661,2.0458,2.4104,7.1939,2.4468,7.7753,2.4937,2.5314,5.6544,3.0388,7.3159,7.0334,0.6391,2.1365,1.2995,7.8475,4.6449,6.1584,2.8623,0.0035,2.0806,2.53,1.4839,4.1662,1.6953,0.1995,0.9598,1.3753,0.4532,1.8447,3.6255,2.707,1.8973,1.3599,2.5167,1.2699,0.8491,1.9522,3.6036,0.6296,0.5062,1.8082,5.1845,0.4885,8.6478,2.1297,1.3098,2.252,4.4277,0.2581,0.4163,5.8757,0.3726,1.047,2.245,1.6038,2.8061,0.9008,3.382,5.9756,0.0029,1.1158,1.0786,4.7116,0.0779,5.1432,4.4683,4.7574,3.3443,0.8125,0.0932,0.0371,3.5143,0.5249,5.528,0.1048,3.1752,0.9031,6.1737,2.8175,1.6695,6.7128,0.0841,3.2868,6.7621,2.918,1.808,6.324,1.845,2.324,7.1494,2.633,6.11,0.4476,3.3389,0.6736,3.5507,0.1824,1.2614,7.472,1.158,5.7418,0.6374,1.0834,2.0861,1.0306,5.8996,16.7109,0.1682,4.1511,0.8259,1.6949,2.7206,0.4054,2.0492,1.9424,0.0088,0.3989,1.9717,3.0562,2.5421,6.5028,3.6388,2.7593,0.3983,0.8248,0.0003,5.6477,1.52,6.3691,0.2226,0.2019,0.6343,0.0196,1.6373,4.6662,6.813,1.2819,0.7002,10.1425,2.477,1.3302,4.9156,3.6084,0.3815,2.8015,0.7686,1.6888,0.518,0.2248,2.3883,8.9062,1.8004,2.8784,1.4196,4.8048,3.3478,6.3141,6.1132,9.3996,0.8525,3.2761,6.8088,3.4567,5.6809,4.4975,0.6234,4.5712,3.7901,0.4833,0.1052,0.4733,3.4627,0.5001,5.5154,3.9466,0.0102,1.1442,1.6785,1.9862,6.9673,1.1886,8.2359,0.6471,6.4501,2.2796,6.2765,0.7669,3.1472,5.4742,0.5464,1.0454,0.8071,3.1985,5.5611,0.6361,0.0952,7.9817,1.6455,4.4418,3.5995,0.0021,4.7593,5.1882,0.0304,7.0864,1.3,3.6772,2.5381,0.0444,2.1764,1.253,1.3176,0.7313,0.2109,0.2661,5.9238,0.7361,4.107,0.175,1.8326,0.0015,4.3403,1.9833,3.3632,0.3172,3.7678,2.7612,3.2517,6.2808,0.3126,4.2639,0.5466,3.0024,4.6997,1.3414,1.0814,2.0349,1.8057,8.2137,0.0133,5.5607,7.7383,2.4933,6.5698,4.8789,5.6158,3.45,5.0919,3.9696,4.4424,1.2212,11.4996,6.473,5.1481,0.9579,0.637,4.6197,0.5289,3.7145,4.3355,1.4191,0.9959,0.0002,5.7854,1.4277,1.1265,8.8734,5.3119,0.4273,0.0707,4.3594,3.6492,0.2125,4.586,1.4698,1.1505,1.1676,2.2734,8.6126,1.6044,0.9399,0.1298,0.6698,2.1953,1.5694,2.3479,2.6549,1.488,0.1463,0.0875,4.5526,9.7822,0.204,5.5423,6.1787,5.0729,1.8302,2.3662,0.3472,3.1279,1.2243,4.1679,2.5992,1.6565,2.0499,9.7572,0.5553,2.6624,4.3703,2.8053,4.9966,5.0933,5.1293,0.0382,2.8276,4.7739,0.3735,0.144,3.9295,6.2512,0.2554,3.0831,2.7862,0.7902,7.3558,3.2571,0.7294,9.6833,3.442,0.0931,10.3005,0.0136,8.8307,4.3009,1.4179,1.3565,6.3902,0.58,1.6195,1.8758,4.6876,0.73,5.8582,2.4005,2.3555,0.6266,2.6999,2.4445,0.6433,1.0291,1.3762,0.4827,5.9367,2.8212,1.0087,3.7099,4.927,0.3114,0.6664,2.0381,1.5941,1.911,0.7595,5.6967,0.0268,4.6264,1.3126,5.4285,3.4175,11.3444,0.24,0.0012,0.3517,0.1802,6.2668,1.3985,0.7727,0.7531,0.7831,0.6084,5.2624,0.0008,0.0331,0.0296,7.6691,3.3246,0.3623,0.5034,0.9739,2.5868,4.3509,0.8599,0.394,4.9188,3.0796,5.9298,3.2444,3.0202,2.1953,5.8004,4.0115,0.2825,0.8428,0.0002,4.9219,3.5984,5.3472,0.3177,3.8488,2.8273,1.1533,1.6808,3.1768,0.1778,0.4267,1.9526,5.8558,2.7369,2.2527,8.0082,0.918,1.4296,0.3263,1.0967,0.0028,6.9023,0.2949,4.2288,6.1739,0.0246,1.4169,11.2765,0.5095,0.5474,5.9877,0.992,4.3043,1.8626,5.8798,0.6128,1.7139,2.2651,0.0053,7.2547,2.3753,7.0431,3.3517,1.8119,3.1569,0.7241,7.3152,2.3549,1.3729,3.7897,1.7861,4.1698,5.5588,1.514,1.7849,0.0002,2.0776,5.6522,0.1299,3.3414,4.0481,0.4379,6.6146,2.4251,3.3614,3.9799,0.1232,0.055,0.1201,10.8071,0.9269,1.6961,0.663,2.1217,5.5337,2.0233,1.4434,1.8079,2.0238,2.6759,1.4723,6.2488,0.514,2.0772,4.0994,6.729,1.9049,2.4149,4.0358,0.0023,8.4183,7.8477,0.8365,3.2833,0.8033,1.4527,6.4666,0.9168,2.805,3.2704,5.506,0.0051,5.558,4.3134,4.3001,6.2182,2.4848,2.5332,0.3807,4.7811,1.2083,0.1045,2.039,1.3143,1.6641,1.2421,4.0744,3.4549,3.3853,5.0122,0.3341,5.8577,0.102,0.8321,3.1401,0.031,1.5068,1.0223,7.0789,0.129,0.8371,3.2025,0.3061,1.0577,4.3574,2.0278,4.2354,1.9405,2.0305,0.7495,2.3758,1.1532,7.7104,1.3321,6.5239,4.0564,2.1314,3.8814,0.0063,5.094,4.5188,1.2037,1.7337,6.2142,0.0102,4.2711,0.8119,1.4736,2.229,2.5595,0.0249,2.7518,5.9673,1.7627,4.6534,0.6901]}
{"id":735,"ended":true,"length":560,"text":"In April \u2013 May 2005 Jifna hosted the first annual International Artists'Workshop in Palestine. The festival, known as the `` Jifna Spring `` was the first held in a rural village in the center of the Negev Desert. The workshop was a three week arts program, organized by Israeli artist, Mira Ehrlich (a co-director of the workshop), and Jifna. The festival sought to establish creative partnerships with artists from across the world. The workshop brought together forty-four artists who were part of the larger Jifna Palestinian artists collective. The collective has held workshops across and within Israeli and Palestinian society.\n\nThe Jifna Spring is Jifna's annual art festival, which started in the spring of 2005 as an annual event. In its inaugural year, the festival was held in the Palestinian town of Al - Bireh (near Ramallah ), with works by Israeli artists and Palestinian artists.\n\nJifna is a Palestinian community non-profit organization that works in Palestine, the US, Germany, and Canada. Jifna\u2019s art festivals and other programs aim to give a voice to Palestinian culture, using art as a medium for positive change and to build community.\n\nJifna is run as a network of social enterprises. Our art is supported by a monthly subsidy from the Palestinian Ministry of Culture and Information.

{"id":4179,"ended":false,"length":572,"text":"In 1903, Pittsburgh Pirates'owner Barney Dreyfuss began to look for ground to build a larger capacity replacement for the team's then @ - @ current home, Exposition Park. Dreyfuss' idea was to move the team to a location where he would be close to home, so the team could travel more, while being a larger crowd draw. His choice was to move the franchise to a \"new\" city, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nDreyfuss' idea came shortly after the baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, banned the team from playing under the name \"Pittsburgh Pirates\".\n\nIn Pittsburgh, one of Dreyfuss' supporters was a newspaper owner by the name of William Wrigley. Wrigley also wanted a bigger place for his team to play as he saw Chicago as a potential rival in his pursuit of the American League. As the year went by, the Wrigley family's Pittsburgh Tribune-Review newspaper and Dreyfuss' Pittsburgh Express would back up their mutual pursuit of the AL with reports that Wrigley wanted a new stadium in Pittsburgh, that he wanted the team to become known as the \"Pirates,\" and that he would pay to build the stadium. Both papers would also back up Dreyfuss' claim that the team would draw up to 500 000 spectators in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn addition to this, a group of six partners who would take over the team at the time of a sale (called a \" controlling interest\" by baseball rules ) would need to be present when the move of the team to Pittsburgh was announced.\n\nDreyfuss and Wrigley met in a hotel in the city of Pittsburgh near the ballpark in early 1904 ; by the end of the talk, they made a deal that left Wrigley with full control of the Pittsburgh franchise while Dreyfuss would continue to manage it until his death in 1909. In exchange for Dreyfuss' stake in the franchise, Wrigley would pay for the construction of a stadium in Pittsburg that would allow for the franchise to remain in Pittsburgh.\n\nWrigley also promised Dreyfuss that he would \"provide sufficient funding to build a new major league stadium in Pittsburgh \" ; while the amount wasn't specified at the time, it is estimated that it was as much as $4 million.\n\nAt least 1 000 000 spectators turned out at the ballpark in 1903, including many from outside the Pittsburgh area. Attendance was estimated to be 1 million in 1904 and as much as 2 million in 1906. The first game in the new location brought in 1, 730 000 spectators, with 2, 750 000 attending the opening night game in 1906.\n\nIn addition to this, Pittsburgh was \"the most populous sports city in

{"id":1474,"ended":false,"length":559,"text":"On 11 June she was commissioned by the RCN and renamed Restigouche, although her refit was not completed until 20 August. Restigouche was assigned to the Canadian Pacific Coast and arrived at Esquimalt, British Columbia on 5 October 1943. On 23 November she underwent a three-week refit at Esquimalt, and while she was undergoing an experimental procedure for the elimination of static buildup on the shaft by an experiment in which she was painted with talcum powder, the shaft failed and the ship had to leave port for repairs. The next day the repair work was completed, but the ship remained in port because of bad weather and was later assigned to patrol duties off Prince Rupert, British Columbia.\n\nAfter an overhaul at Esquimalt that lasted from 13 May until 1 June 1944, Restigouche was assigned to service with the Canadian Naval Detachment on the Great Banks of Newfoundland until the end of the war. On 14 September she ran aground off Pointe au Baril, Nova Scotia and had to be refloated. In early November she was assigned to service with the Newfoundland detachment and on 29 November was sent back to Esquimalt for a major refit that included conversion to a radar picket craft. On 21 January 1945 the work was completed and she returned to the Newfoundland station. At this time, she was reclassified as a minelayer.\n\nRestigouche left New York on 5 April and arrived at Freetown, Sierra Leone on 26 May. While there Restigouches crew replaced damaged landing craft after the flooding of the landing craft basin. She departed on 16 August on patrol between that island and Dakar, Senegal, returning the next day. Early on 20 September Restigouche collided with a merchantman, and the British ship suffered considerable damage while resting on the river bottom in the vicinity of Cap-Vert.\n\nRestigouche departed on 25 September on patrol between Sierra Leone and Dakar, but the next day was transferred to the Far East for anti-submarine work. The ship returned to New York on 21 October, and departed on 1 November for overhaul and reequipment at Brooklyn, New York. On 9 December she was assigned to a convoy between Pearl Harbor and Guam, where she arrived on 19 December. She was then redesignated an anti-submarine minesweeper on 12 January 1946. She sailed for Pearl Harbor with an escort group at the start of February, arriving on 8 February. She left Pearl Harbor on the 17th, after duty in waters south of Japan, in a patrol that lasted until 2 March. That day she arrived at San Pedro, California for inactivation.

{"id":1652,"ended":true,"length":577,"text":"On August 14, 1862, Pitman left school without his family's knowledge and volunteered to serve in the Union Army and fight in the American Civil War. He apparently never informed his parents that he was leaving, as they reported him missing after a month into service. He is commonly referred to as \"Battles\" throughout the book. His disappearance marked the first major loss of life of the Civil War.\n\nBattles joined the Union Army in Columbia, South Carolina, on August 14, 1862, and soon volunteered for the Union Army. He fought under the command of Brigadier General John Buford, later becoming one of his best men. From July 22 to August 17, he fought in Georgia, but the Army of the James was still moving. Once General Rosecrans crossed the Chickahominy River on August 17, Buford's brigade was sent to join General Stuart's cavalry forces. On August 18, his brigade faced Stuart's army at the Battle of New Market in North Carolina. In that battle, Buford's men were outnumbered by Stuart's cavalry. Pitman's regiment was left behind, as were other regiments of the same division. While some fled, others withdrew into the thickest part of the battle, fighting hand-to-hand battle.\n\nBattles was killed in action during the battle, after his horse was shot down. He was the first major casualty in the Union army as a result of the Battle of New Market. He was buried in West Point Cemetery in Columbia.\n\nDespite his father's death, Battles Pitman eventually became a successful businessman in Columbia and eventually became the president of the Columbia National Bank in 1876.\n\nOn July 28, 1870, Pitman donated property to the Daughters of American Colonists in Columbia, South Carolina. The land was the site of a house that stood in the center of the present day campus, which is known as \"Pitman Hall\" on the campus.\n\nThis article has been sourced from Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License; additional terms may apply.

The US artillery, attached to the 9th Infantry Division, destroyed a large part of the 1st Infantry Division\u2019s main force including tanks, infantry and supplies. The 1st Infantry Division\u2019s commander, General Kim Seung-soo lost the battlefield.[1]\n\nOn the night between 25 and 26 October, the 15th Infantry Regiment and the US 103 and 677 Artillery Battalions engaged the ROK 1st Infantry Division. Their artillery fire had an overall disastrous effect on the 1st Infantry Division, which was not only a mobile formation as its tanks were not as heavy as those of the US, but was also a heavily armed and armored brigade with the P-40 fighter aircraft.\n\nThe ROK 5th Battalion 1st Infantry Division and the US 5th Battalion 1st Infantry Division met in the area of Samtan River. In this battle, the ROK forces with the support from the artillery, overwhelmed and routed the US forces, which were caught unawares. At night on the second day, the 1st Infantry Division retreated south from the Pohang City area. On 26 October, the US forces had been destroyed.\n\nAt dawn on the morning of the 26 October, the ROK 5th Battalion and the US 5th Battalion of the 15th Infantry Regiment met in the area of Samtan River. The infantrymen charged towards each other at the speed of 60-80 km\/hr., and the battle between the two forces ended in a draw.\n\nOn 27 October 1948, the ROK forces with tanks and artillery, attacked towards the Han River and the 15th Infantry Regiment to seize the Pohang city. After destroying the 15th Infantry Regiment\u2019s main forces and the supply area, the ROK forces entered the city at 10 am on 28 October.\n\nDuring the Battle of Pohang, the ROK 1st Infantry Division destroyed the 15th Infantry Regiment, cut off the 15th Infantry Regiment\u2019s reserve force.

{"id":4975,"ended":true,"length":567,"text":"On July 18, a tropical storm formed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and was named Doreen. It steadily intensified, and became a hurricane on July 19. Doreen briefly became the first hurricane of the season, but it weakened after a mid-tropospheric eye formed on July 20 as it neared the Leeward Islands. The storm continued to weaken as it turned northward and passed over Hispaniola. Although Doreen had lost winds, it continued to produce torrential rainfall along much of its track. More than 10 inches (254 mm) of rain fell over Haiti on and near the center of Doreen, resulting in high streamflow. Doreen then turned inland and dissipated on July 23. Rainfall from Doreen was responsible for significant flooding on Hispaniola, as well as flash flooding over Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.\n\nDoreen produced a rainfall of more than 2 inches (51 mm), with up to 8 inches (203 mm) falling in Haiti, which caused extensive flash flooding and water rescues. The rainfall further exacerbated existing flood problems in that country, where flooding has become increasingly common, particularly in agricultural areas of the southwest. Rainfall also caused torrential downpours over Jamaica, resulting in high streamflow that flooded some fields. Flash flooding occurred in numerous locations in the country, including Montego Bay, which was inundated. About 11 inches (285 mm) of rain fell in one 24-hour period in one location in Jamaica. Heavy flows led to several vehicle accidents.\n\nDoreen remained close to its center to conserve energy. As a result, the storm was able to produce large tornadoes over the Leeward Islands. The worst tornado recorded by a National Weather Service station in the U.S.A. happened over Doreen. It was so strong it overturned a ship and knocked out electric power.\n\nDoreen produced high waves and strong, large swells. These swells had an effect on the Leeward Islands, contributing to a rise along the coastline and causing beach erosion. There were reports of people becoming injured along the island of Antigua.

{"id":1777,"ended":true,"length":513,"text":"Almost as soon as the Jin armies had left Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong reneged on the deal and dispatched two armies to repel the Jurchen troops attacking Taiyuan and bolster the defenses of Zhongshan and Fengdu [Kweichow University]. Although he managed to stop the attack on Taiyuan, he suffered considerable losses against the Jurchen forces, probably in excess of 10,000 killed and wounded. However, the Imperial Forces were able to contain the Jurchen forces long enough not to be dislodged from Zhongshan, and the two sides ended up in a stalemate during the winter months of 1107-1108.\n\nIn late fall 1108, the Jianshijie [Koujirou] Army of the Jin attacked Fengdu. Once again, as on the previous occasion, Emperor Qinzong sent two large armies to face the Jurchens, the Jingzhou [Fengdu] Army and the Xixiang Army under Tianyi. Although the Xixiang Army was able to drive back the attack, the Jingzhou Army suffered considerably. The Jin forces were able to penetrate the defenses of Fengdu and were only stopped when winter set in. The siege of Fengdu lasted until the following year when Jin forces took the city without a battle.\n\nIn 1109, the Xixiang Army under Tianyi moved to attack Luoyang, an important city in the Eastern Han. At Luoyang, Emperor Taizong (Li Maozhen) was holding court and conducting government affairs. As this could be construed as an act of provocation, Jin officials feared that Emperor Taizong might use the occasion to declare war and decided to go to war against the Jin immediately. In the beginning of the siege, the Jin forces were pushed back several times before they were able to take complete control of the city. Emperor Taizong was forced to cede all imperial cities including the capital Suicheng to the Jin. This gave the Jin total control over China east of the Yangtze River.\n\nWhen news of the fall of Luoyang reached the Jurchen chieftains, they sent Zhangsun Yuanjing (\u6f06\u5b6b\u91d1\u91d1\u63a8\u84ee) to Fengdu to urge Jin General Shi Jingtang (\u65bd\u91d1\u5929) to come to the aid of Emperor Taizong. When Jiangxi forces arrived, Zhangsun was sent to Fengdu to announce Emperor Taizong's surrender to the Jin. Zhangsun then marched to Suicheng and delivered in person Emperor Taizong's letter pledging obedience to Emperor Gaozong. With this turn of events, Empress Dowager Zhangsu, the last of the imperial family members to remain in China, also submitted to the Jin. In spring 1109, Emperor Gaozong gave Fengdu to Zhangsun Yuanjing, while Empress Kang was given the title Empress-consort of the Jin. The rest of the Imperial family and Emperor Taizong and his entourage fled to Xianyang [Kazinshir]\n\n[There are many versions of this story, but I cannot vouch for the accuracy of them].","token_len":660,"entropy":[5.2259,4.3486,0.0121,1.9233,12.5426,11.3798,3.1199,3.9563,6.4789,5.2986,1.4132,0.913,7.0118,3.5126,7.4893,2.3025,7.0777,3.7277,0.0035,0.3349,1.7827,2.1915,1.7588,5.1126,3.3611,3.5275,1.157,7.006,0.058,0.6281,10.9213,2.7151,4.3408,6.7176,6.9218,2.8368,0.4203,3.4343,8.607,1.0211,3.5332,1.0983,6.0798,1.2677,2.3859,0.3099,2.5357,6.0168,4.939,7.4305,5.3848,8.6562,6.217,7.3299,8.3457,0.8424,4.4144,3.6642,5.2917,0.0366,4.1527,0.6642,3.4243,2.3078,2.6196,0.0022,0.0009,0.7076,1.5786,5.0751,3.8408,0.8201,4.4993,0.6749,2.1144,0.0142,1.4594,1.829,6.9635,4.3095,5.0299,0.0045,3.384,0.1942,0.0126,4.7277,1.4271,2.307,0.5359,4.0119,0.0696,1.7118,4.7186,5.7562,2.1147,1.1548,0.0038,4.4375,0.337,3.4568,0.0074,0.7621,6.4075,0.0159,8.0139,0.0804,2.4574,5.9261,0.0258,0.0036,1.6103,2.3071,0.0031,0.0035,0.0012,2.1278,1.011,1.7588,4.2711,4.6894,4.8956,0.3728,2.6861,0.828,0.6738,0.002,5.2584,0.4278,4.7574,2.99,1.4893,9.0651,2.3782,1.271,2.5692,0.8032,0.5562,0.8708,0.0056,2.8017,5.3293,5.904,2.8798,0.4032,0.5688,1.4705,4.5473,4.1713,5.2728,8.6243,4.952,5.9681,2.3437,4.0375,3.7202,6.1711,0.624,1.1935,4.1022,3.9514,0.9365,2.5074,4.2519,6.0528,0.058,2.347,6.3623,1.2315,0.6387,6.115,7.3208,1.8082,0.9639,2.3927,0.2265,1.3605,0.0466,0.0134,0.0013,3.7237,1.5914,4.6708,1.2743,0.6717,6.8226,1.2489,1.4713,5.1554,1.462,3.4898,5.1642,4.37,2.5195,4.4092,0.3312,0.4644,0.6875,1.0516,1.4627,0.1953,6.0561,4.3001,1.648,2.4472,5.7144,8.4399,4.5485,2.4426,3.2273,1.0535,3.8059,0.0353,0.0129,0.4379,1.293,2.394,0.0045,6.0101,2.6434,0.3615,6.3836,1.6,1.0388,1.0575,0.0062,0.3879,3.1264,5.1442,2.9612,1.6777,2.522,3.8021,1.6491,1.3624,0.0077,6.71,0.8505,5.1968,0.197,3.1231,0.002,0.9403,4.6882,6.2258,5.2093,2.1366,11.7771,6.7056,0.0219,1.0452,1.8698,7.4033,0.4851,1.4419,0.0007,3.3751,2.7537,1.3646,3.3679,1.7598,3.1747,5.7307,1.38,4.3274,2.4363,2.1927,7.8105,1.8792,3.2953,0.962,1.0471,0.0002,1.8429,2.0695,0.3182,0.3369,0.9988,4.9673,0.3693,0.0251,0.1799,4.73,1.3466,0.0042,5.4547,1.0429,3.486,6.2143,2.3517,0.1559,2.0987,4.0193,1.8244,1.747,1.0343,0.8286,5.8626,3.9964,3.2014,4.3765,3.7677,0.0005,0.0026,0.2747,1.6569,7.8545,2.7981,0.7231,6.0875,5.8139,7.4102,11.6295,0.2729,3.3491,7.0707,4.0106,1.3396,7.0934,6.5672,1.8816,0.7468,3.2752,5.2611,6.7652,1.6498,3.5937,0.1961,1.8933,2.6411,0.0237,5.8725,0.5531,6.9581,7.3067,5.6543,0.6444,4.957,0.2799,0.0004,0.0029,1.4512,3.0257,1.0807,4.9799,0.2922,4.8975,1.0302,4.0952,8.0919,0.1714,4.3054,1.1558,0.6867,1.4613,0.7797,1.5692,7.5078,0.9027,2.8603,2.1954,5.2498,0.6803,0.8836,5.254,0.8576,1.3513,1.1964,2.063,1.9765,5.4546,0.1696,4.4754,0.3614,3.655,2.0686,1.311,0.6685,0.0032,3.6463,8.1662,0.062,0.233,1.4117,0.1874,0.4166,3.2705,0.1097,0.0005,0.0059,2.7563,2.8609,0.0623,8.4419,0.047,3.6859,8.3856,6.5489,6.3544,2.2022,2.0591,7.2442,5.4144,0.4168,1.2859,0.3214,0.9247,1.6053,3.233,4.4617,0.6785,0.7545,6.3936,0.1642,0.5745,5.8114,9.1819,0.1893,0.4115,1.8135,0.0716,0.0015,0.0995,1.1068,1.2188,0.0002,4.5877,6.4282,0.4365,0.4649,3.795,0.0869,1.5491,0.0004,0.0041,0.6729,1.0599,6.5552,0.5801,10.7275,0.0614,0.144,0.7921,1.2222,2.8491,7.4697,7.1327,6.9378,7.6323,0.9299,5.0433,3.8178,5.3144,5.5493,3.4849,5.2675,1.493,5.8438,0.554,3.7392,3.9301,2.3653,3.6537,4.6285,0.7568,0.8487,0.7283,9.3215,0.0195,0.7468,6.858,6.474,5.4813,5.0174,4.1085,4.1479,3.4277,0.601,5.6083,4.3936,4.8821,0.2512,5.9784,2.1149,0.2018,4.4269,0.7629,1.34,2.0402,0.0242,2.5547,0.5306,0.0007,0.0056,0.68,3.363,8.3759,2.3506,6.4817,1.397,1.016,2.6505,0.0117,2.4688,3.7307,0.4152,5.122,0.0017,0.3834,5.6743,5.164,0.1329,0.0007,0.0081,0.0478,2.9161,2.066,0.6349,1.8099,0.4964,3.1967,0.0095,3.7078,4.7305,1.1193,3.5144,0.107,0.0011,1.3458,6.1258,7.398,4.2953,5.5598,0.1635,0.0009,0.0076,0.6839,4.0759,7.3559,4.7027,0.2808,1.8277,9.4525,0.2615,3.8806,1.4634,1.7104,5.2517,2.0918,8.5378,0.124,0.0149,0.1689,6.396,6.1403,0.2173,5.5104,6.4024,4.804,2.0152,4.121,1.5289,0.3989,4.045,3.2568,2.2053,1.7547,4.4981,0.7611,1.4527,0.345,4.7566,6.0676,1.2271,1.412,2.723,1.5575,3.3461,7.7625,1.6743,0.6389,0.1149,1.3154,3.2652,0.0019,0.0053,0.005,4.5691,6.6186,0.0033,4.268,4.1315,0.0414,0.4167,0.034,1.7315,5.1087,2.4965,11.4406,4.9384,4.0643,1.5531,2.4863,4.3195,5.6557,9.447,0.2585,1.9425,0.9089,1.6221,0.342,2.7166,6.0632,0.0734,0.2452,3.3206,1.391,4.5825,4.0586,2.2427,0.0018,0.0038,5.5021,2.5331,4.7812,0.0005,3.8821,0.7576,5.6067,2.0241,3.227,2.9719,3.5201,5.9612,11.1428,3.1347,5.7334,4.5232,5.9978,0.0002,5.2519,6.2461,1.267,1.711,5.7678,0.2192,0.8653,0.6971,1.3576,1.2612,2.7891,5.0149,6.0614,0.0064,0.0487,1.0653,0.781,0.5605,2.8055,3.0778]}
{"id":458,"ended":false,"length":535,"text":"The United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) recorded eight aftershocks in the two hours after the main earthquake, with magnitudes between 4 @. @ 3 and 5 @. @ 9.\n\nThe USGS said yesterday that it recorded 11 aftershocks stronger than magnitude 4, including a magnitude 3.7 quake that hit at 6 a.m. The agency said eight aftershocks between 4 @. @ 3 & 5 @ @ 9.\n\nAn emergency official said the quake has not caused significant damage and no serious injuries, reports the AP.\n\nThe official said the quake was recorded by five GPS stations, including three operated by the military and two by universities.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was about 13 miles southeast of the Pacific island nation as of last night. The strongest aftershock registered a magnitude of 5 and occurred at 7:35 am ET, the USGS said.\n\nThe quake also prompted authorities to shut down an air traffic control tower at Keflavik Air Base where U.S. Air Force planes based there.\n\nHe said Iceland was not likely to see any tsunami because the depth or the epicenter of the quake did not generate one.\n\nWe expect earthquakes, but we have been very fortunate in that we\u2019ve only had a few in recent years as opposed to more frequent earthquakes in the last 400 years as Iceland would have experienced.\n\n\u2018\u2018We\u2019re not worried about any long term aftershocks,\u2019\u2019 \u00deorvald added. \u2018\u2018The biggest challenge will be to get the air-traffic control tower up and running again. That tower has been in place since 1954 and the last time it was shut down was after the devastating North American Earthquake of 1964, but it was fixed in two days. The tower is being checked right now to make sure it is safe.\u2019\u2019\n\nIcelandic seismologist J\u00f3n Olafsson said his team had measured five aftershocks, although the first was less than magnitude 1. None had occurred above magnitude 3, he said.\n\nA magnitude 3.7 earthquake struck on Wednesday in the same spot as a magnitude 4.3 temblor that hit on Jan 2. The quakes are being called \u201ctwo foreshocks\u201d of a larger event.\n\nBoth of Wednesday\u2019s quakes measured a magnitude of 4.3 on the Richter scale.\n\nThe aftershocks could be felt on the ground for about 20 seconds, Mr. Olafsson said. They should diminish soon, he said.\n\nA stronger quake could cause the seismic activity to move in a way that would put more stress on Iceland\u2019s volcanic system and lead to increased volcanoes,

{"id":3101,"ended":false,"length":633,"text":"At the 2015 San Diego Comic @ - @ Con International, Sean Callery revealed he was composing music for Jessica Jones, eventually stating that the music required for each episode ranged from 9 to 12 minutes, and that he had composed four episodes of the series so far (\"We recorded the music at the Comic - Con panel, where Sean was also present, by the way,\" noted an announcement of the show at the time), and that \"The music is so integral to not only the tone of the show, but also the tone of the comic book.\" [1] At the 2014 New York Comic-Con, Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige praised Callery's music as \"incredible,\" and confirmed that Callery was composing music for the show.[2]\n\nCallery revealed in a Twitter conversation with composer Michael Giacchino that he has composed \"seven\" episodes of Jessica Jones as of December 2015. [3]\n\nHe revealed in an interview in Variety on August 2, 2015 that he will be composing the music for the series.[4] He later expanded on the topic on his Facebook page:[5]\n\nJust a few weeks ago, I joined series composer Sean Callery and series showrunner Melissa Rosenberg at Comic-Con International in San Diego for Jessica Jones' first ever panel. And although I'm excited to be joining the Marvel Universe as a mainstay, I was more nervous before the panel than I've ever been in my life. Not out of any fear of what might happen, but rather out of my concern for how I could possibly live up to everyone else's insanely high standards. Everyone was so kind and welcoming (like they always are), and although I've been a huge fan of the series already, the music is so integral to not only the tone of the show, but also the tone of the comic book so it was a huge responsibility. But I have to say that the team at Marvel and I were like family right from the jump. We hit it off like old friends and it was so easy to just come up with things that I've never even considered before. I mean, just as an example, \"Coffee & Conversation,\" the opening theme for the show, was inspired by listening to Michael Giacchino's Batman scores from the 90s. And that's definitely something I've never considered doing. If I had thought about doing it, I probably would have gone for a more traditional, sweeping string motif and not an 8 minute short film of piano and voice. But you can't win 'em all right? You can only improve. Like last night, Michael Giacchino and I shared a few jokes here and there which made the night even more fun. What made the evening even more special is that I got to sit next to my wife, Lorna, who is now also the proud owner of an 'in' with the entire Marvel Universe :) I mean, what are the odds? We've been living a dream over the past few days and it feels surreal. Just wait until you see the show. You're in for a real treat.\n\nCallery also composed the show's theme.

{"id":141,"ended":true,"length":577,"text":"The director's original cut of Sholay has a different ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the three brothers are gunned down by police, have already been retained in the film. \"We will leave no stone unturned, we will shoot at any cost, we will be relentless till we end up restoring \" Ram Gopal Varma on his new film Shobhana \". The film, starring Priety Zinta, is an adaptation, in its essence, of William Boyd's novel, \" The Nightwatchman \". Varma has retained most of the basic elements of William Boyd's book ; the name Ram Gopal Varma, the protagonist Gabbar and his group of goons. The film depicts Gabbar as a powerful chief who has become a hero to a whole community. The film also stars Naseeruddin Shah, Bindu, Sharmila Tagore, Mithun Chakraborthy and Kader Khan. It will be Varma's second film with the actress after his debut film \" Company \" with her in 1990. Varma has had some difficulty finalizing Gabbar and his gang in the movie. It was the actress'idea to retain Bindu as one of Ram Gopal Varma's gang in her character. Bindu, who had last worked with Varma in \" Company \", has reportedly told him that she is more than willing to act as Ram Gopal Varma's sister in this film. During the shoot, Ram Gopal Varma, according to the film's story and script-writer, Nihar Sircar, has been spending long hours in the gym ; he has also worked extensively on his body in order to portray this ruthless gang leader on screen. It was also reported that Ram Gopal Varma's brother, Ramesh Varma, has put about Rs. 3 lakh into'the muscle'of the director. According to Sircar, it now will be a more expensive film than \" Company \". Another problem that Varma is facing is the location of his shoot in the movie. In William Boyd's book, the film is set in the jungles of Tamil Nadu. But Varma has decided to shoot in Mumbai and Karnataka. Sircar claims that Varma had made it clear to Sircar that \" he was not planning to shoot anywhere near Chennai and Kodaikanal, and the jungles were going out of the question as well.\" Varma had said in one of the interviews that his film would be a remake of the novel \"The Nightwatchman\" by William Boyd. The book, published in 1988, was awarded the British Crime Book of the Year. The movie version, however, will be different from the book. Although the script-writer has retained the basic elements of the book, there will be some differences due to budget issues. According to the script-writer's admission, the film was almost three hours but Ram Gopal Varma decided to trim it down to one. In the original, Gabbar leads a gang of goons. Here, he meets four policemen and kills all but one. This is the only change which has been made by Varma.","token_len":663,"entropy":[8.5847,2.8743,6.1679,6.8887,0.9648,7.0627,7.7295,3.7259,4.5607,3.2132,3.9323,3.5432,3.9059,1.4015,8.1541,4.5183,0.573,5.8468,8.8309,6.0907,2.0948,6.714,0.0152,4.3747,4.9843,8.8744,1.5016,0.8677,5.3303,0.0028,1.637,2.3716,5.0757,2.9649,4.2748,0.9654,3.2935,1.6287,0.2166,2.8544,4.9215,5.0678,1.4796,5.5976,0.0064,2.2084,5.7653,0.5524,2.7579,4.6928,0.3621,9.2502,1.4622,0.4399,2.0595,0.7404,5.494,2.4809,4.8193,5.5604,3.6261,0.4928,0.0025,0.0,3.2414,2.5842,0.6708,5.161,4.3983,2.5791,3.9568,1.7552,1.7449,0.18,4.0472,4.9405,7.9685,1.8807,5.508,1.803,10.4464,8.1787,9.0749,6.1975,0.301,5.1893,1.5445,5.1897,4.105,5.7373,2.2953,5.3027,5.9314,1.845,2.5797,7.5782,2.114,2.421,3.1558,4.8121,6.8091,13.6267,8.1511,9.6949,0.2682,0.8694,2.7613,4.8719,1.1789,5.9957,4.1742,4.1747,4.7039,0.2189,0.1982,8.6543,8.7815,0.3907,1.9159,1.9922,2.2399,2.1058,5.4638,8.7914,0.2232,0.8828,4.3406,0.0126,3.1062,8.0169,4.8075,0.0638,0.5907,6.4293,1.1266,0.323,7.3437,0.1538,0.0988,3.4169,7.569,2.0222,5.9151,2.1128,0.156,0.0047,0.4755,0.0009,1.5674,1.7392,5.2214,11.7952,0.0225,2.3207,0.7973,5.2039,0.5187,7.459,0.07,1.8963,1.4894,1.6433,5.3837,2.6868,0.0099,0.9537,0.6222,6.367,8.3412,1.7497,2.2514,3.43,1.4001,3.439,1.2294,3.4082,3.2575,2.785,1.3233,1.6102,1.5436,2.0363,4.4981,5.0723,4.1704,0.5947,1.939,4.2482,0.8785,5.4092,5.0071,5.3508,4.3156,4.7427,0.4492,8.0189,0.0161,0.4999,8.358,3.5033,5.7013,0.4408,17.7007,1.5255,4.2433,8.5419,4.6379,0.5356,3.2257,3.2918,0.6043,8.1944,0.013,0.0951,2.3886,1.3452,2.875,1.8863,6.8166,5.0477,2.3074,3.6332,2.3094,2.2608,10.7693,1.7847,2.5597,4.5459,4.1645,5.1278,0.3015,3.1007,0.0034,2.0123,4.0329,3.2912,5.644,10.4931,0.8085,10.8942,0.0265,3.9225,0.9134,4.0783,2.4608,0.8033,3.3964,1.1638,3.7217,1.5227,3.8469,4.0135,3.7841,11.0769,0.6105,3.0381,5.3134,6.9554,0.4461,2.2749,4.4111,0.0284,4.7551,0.0825,0.0025,0.5644,0.0008,0.0764,4.0911,4.7284,4.781,6.0611,1.0803,4.5191,0.0131,2.0721,1.0553,2.5168,6.1509,4.0801,1.3198,1.7964,0.0016,1.0892,1.5428,1.9127,0.8779,2.1158,5.4871,3.724,3.6417,0.8911,1.5786,1.8534,5.5865,2.4912,2.4543,0.0211,6.1647,0.612,2.639,0.0954,0.0019,0.2914,0.0008,0.0369,5.9712,2.365,3.2346,0.8261,0.2762,6.3099,0.7246,3.269,0.7674,2.6415,0.0638,0.0016,0.2863,0.0002,3.1394,6.4841,0.0009,1.8715,2.1918,0.4646,5.1457,4.494,2.3201,7.0848,2.0465,1.0502,3.892,8.3508,4.2096,6.6377,0.4411,0.4991,2.9531,2.7004,7.0769,6.9435,0.4096,1.994,1.036,5.1898,7.7065,1.5995,1.4842,2.6927,4.6491,5.4635,1.7437,1.7653,5.0801,3.7234,3.74,0.0244,6.0081,5.0657,6.6597,3.5139,1.5276,5.3055,1.0487,0.121,3.8038,1.3732,2.6127,2.3107,0.3321,2.1264,0.0428,0.0023,0.0657,0.0002,1.8672,3.8775,1.2651,4.2554,2.3637,0.0049,2.487,0.03,0.2307,1.5524,7.2939,7.269,5.0048,1.5475,3.5879,1.1622,1.5564,15.0631,1.9942,9.1298,9.1927,6.9727,1.1743,5.6373,2.3687,3.8051,0.0015,2.6766,0.0244,0.0035,0.1704,3.9328,7.3506,5.3805,0.3966,2.4986,5.7725,2.6866,1.1605,2.3236,2.0118,1.1642,0.8677,5.6116,4.5359,2.5687,2.5157,0.0024,2.883,0.7108,0.6615,1.3996,7.731,0.4995,1.4802,5.0362,1.2988,1.8643,3.728,1.3286,2.9461,10.5879,0.0156,0.0577,2.1079,0.5444,2.3431,2.2976,1.9129,2.9598,0.4627,1.592,5.7887,0.0321,0.1652,4.5594,0.0416,1.5309,4.7085,3.8993,0.0038,1.6553,4.5222,0.2873,1.8946,0.5239,4.8342,2.3626,6.2513,0.002,1.3374,4.8266,0.0251,0.0029,4.5091,0.2229,3.0913,0.0026,3.3122,4.4579,3.5706,1.4263,1.1667,3.3171,0.1648,0.0042,0.2273,3.7288,3.0086,2.6468,1.5697,3.7641,0.5285,0.6829,3.4892,1.9803,3.0832,2.4893,4.4919,7.7311,9.1379,3.2717,2.7988,3.3111,3.7364,8.2312,0.0196,2.0113,6.059,5.7525,0.3774,2.8308,4.2894,3.4233,1.1259,2.0191,3.1445,0.0038,2.6255,3.1853,2.2041,4.9181,0.5143,1.4303,1.9544,0.3717,2.8193,2.9067,1.0744,0.8933,2.8794,4.5036,0.1129,1.3216,1.7283,1.3577,2.3831,0.1498,0.0388,0.0029,1.4593,2.2295,2.5733,0.0144,0.6547,1.8156,3.7413,2.0234,3.9053,0.7592,4.1261,0.2753,1.7296,6.7851,0.7916,5.8843,8.6018,3.4694,2.2466,0.2627,0.0447,2.765,1.6408,2.8298,5.0878,2.335,3.0445,0.0217,2.9165,1.1611,5.0858,1.6262,0.6441,2.6618,1.5887,5.3847,1.1324,3.5862,2.7496,0.3141,2.0053,5.1282,1.3489,3.8979,0.2327,0.1768,1.3438,1.4465,0.2729,3.4627,1.9948,0.2156,1.9742,3.8857,5.1348,0.0057,5.7844,3.5488,0.4497,3.1984,0.0012,1.8508,2.7358,0.3307,0.0643,2.5059,8.0556,0.368,1.4144,1.8856,3.2039,6.7046,5.8471,1.575,7.1663,5.376,0.0515,0.0015,0.0457,0.0003,5.4221,0.2064,7.1392,0.8932,0.391,0.2894,2.4622,3.0808,3.0058,1.1211,3.0342,3.1314,2.6873,0.0167,7.4259,1.7909,2.0697,0.6804,2.4087,0.0448,2.7245,6.3438,0.7815,2.3158,3.9959,5.4317,4.1368,1.9026,4.6878,3.9225,3.2332,0.5043,1.6212,3.6253,1.4094,1.4188,2.557,5.6419,3.9149,2.3269,0.9034,0.2544,4.2261,2.2612,0.0024,1.081]}

Later, with the help of the Mam, the K'izil and P' m'g' p'i' n provinces were brought under the K'iche' i'k'l (i.e. the Spanish kingdom); the Mam and K'izil provinces remained to form the present state of'Atacama - B\u00ed s u a. As we shall see further on, the Mam themselves were probably much more numerous than is currently understood among the native peoples and had considerable control in areas under both K' izil and K'igwam dominion.\n\nIn 1691, with the defeat of the K'igwam rebels of Arica (Hacienda Del Toro), and the submission of their kingdom as a dependency to the Castilian crown, the P' h'et'a' s'k'i' n province was incorporated as a crown dependency in Chile province although this was to lead to a major dispute with the kingdom of P' ngw'h'n (today's northwest Araucan\u00eda).

The K'igwam of Ch'to' w'l ', on the other hand, recognized the authority and paid tribute to the Spanish crown, and was allowed to retain its autonomy. However, as they were at war with the K'igwam of P' h'et'a' k'i' n, and as those of W' h'h'm'and Ch'to' w'l'were already in Spanish hands, these provinces were placed under the direct rule of the Spanish governor-general; the K'izil province was then united with the P'm'g' p'i' n to form the province of Atacama- B\u00ed s u a.\n\nFrom 1770 to 1806, the province of Atacama was still under

{"id":1768,"ended":true,"length":624,"text":"Mole crickets live almost entirely below ground, digging tunnels of different kinds for the major functions of life, including feeding, escape from predators, attracting a mate ( by singing ), defending the colony, and reproduction. The mole cricket ( Phyllocnistis punctata) is about 3 \u2013 4 inches (7.5 \u2013 10 cm ) long, with a relatively small head, large eyes, and a short legs. It lives at the base of roots and underground, where its body is protected from water, sunlight,, and predators, such as ants. Mole crickets tunnel into the soil, leaving a trail of crumbs along which they travel. Male mole crickets use their songs to attract females. The female mole cricket lays about 40 \u2013 80 million eggs, in layers as thin as a paper, which then hatch as nymphs. The nymphs then burrow deeper into the soil to search out their own food, and leave a tunnel in which they spend 2 \u2013 3 months growing and eating, before finally emerging as moths. The moths then mate further below ground, and the cycle repeats. The lifecycle is believed to take about 8 \u2013 9 months for each generation and takes place in the same area for generations, with mole crickets tending to stay in one location. The females use a variety of tunnels to hide in, including under stones, in hollow logs, and in the bark of trees. Mole crickets feed on various grasses, sedges, and other soft plants of open habitats, such as meadows. During the fall, they feed on leaves and decaying wood, often at the base of trees, where they are a danger to the health of the tree. The females are the larger and stronger of the two sexes, and the males will seek solitude. They have red eyes and a light brown, russet-brown, or yellow underbelly. Adult mole crickets are difficult to find, and may be seen only late in the fall of the northern migratory season ( October \u2013 December). At this time, they are looking for mates and to escape predators. They are not often seen at other times in the year. Mole crickets mate during the daytime, at the base of trees, and are often disturbed by people doing yard work. The female lays her eggs in a tube as thin as a piece of paper (up to 1.5 cm ), which is then covered with a thick layer of debris and left to dry for a couple of weeks. Most of the eggs remain hidden, while a small number are laid in open cavities and are seen by observers. The eggs hatch as larvae about 2 \u2013 2 weeks later. In the next few days, they begin to grow into nymphs that then live underground for 2 \u2013 3 months, during which time they leave narrow trails by eating and using their muscles to create the tunnel as they go. The burrowing is aided by soil granules. The nymphs will emerge and then search out food and mate. Mole crickets are generally an insignificant pest, but are a nuisance in large numbers. In the past, they have been known to cause tree disease. In recent years, they have spread, primarily as a result of introduced species. They are present in all states except Alaska.","token_len":665,"entropy":[8.6771,10.0415,3.4762,7.294,6.2097,2.5229,6.3445,3.15,1.3007,8.4792,3.4134,4.5354,5.7909,4.3775,4.2377,2.8052,8.6212,7.9442,0.7865,1.7496,2.0072,2.0715,2.9083,1.3086,9.2679,2.4389,2.4334,0.5261,7.7259,5.382,0.6044,4.5706,10.768,7.6169,2.9613,6.2607,1.9566,2.5928,1.887,1.2486,5.5089,0.5636,2.1269,5.7324,2.6253,3.6613,5.3607,3.7448,2.3565,6.1252,6.1525,3.5297,6.6017,2.2462,2.0575,1.3381,5.3085,3.3344,7.5821,0.5659,2.7677,2.2607,3.5247,1.9413,0.8966,0.4206,1.911,0.2225,5.6911,0.1774,1.2482,1.7582,0.9546,5.6041,2.0935,2.1232,1.8525,4.8848,2.58,0.3781,0.3352,1.3789,3.932,6.3642,0.4481,1.6181,2.8598,3.5422,1.7009,1.8364,0.0477,8.6496,1.5711,5.8011,2.3716,2.6906,3.6401,2.0411,0.8259,4.6276,1.1982,3.8512,2.5762,4.7701,12.3576,0.3968,2.3925,2.6548,3.4584,0.0014,3.7002,1.239,3.0399,0.9069,0.0007,11.3408,2.1359,1.5288,1.2092,1.6342,5.7019,1.9691,2.6473,0.1723,3.1309,3.1623,3.8772,4.7539,0.8385,3.9,1.0549,7.2142,0.4416,0.0609,0.0007,3.7318,1.4246,9.0251,0.2698,2.1497,1.8055,1.5198,2.0713,1.7557,1.5244,2.1141,4.8633,3.5292,4.1356,3.8002,4.9206,6.9898,1.3829,2.0331,4.522,7.347,5.4434,4.1982,0.0104,1.7188,6.6136,6.5419,2.7801,3.8944,1.4672,5.1599,7.3068,0.5123,0.059,0.6013,1.5329,3.8043,0.0006,0.1782,2.8695,4.7979,0.0066,3.8622,0.6581,0.1597,0.3745,1.3922,7.054,3.9212,3.4803,3.1337,2.5295,1.9273,1.5355,6.1735,2.5594,6.4172,3.255,1.0114,0.5537,5.9824,6.8825,1.3497,0.6882,1.9777,4.9183,2.2799,3.9631,3.725,3.3582,3.2655,5.0612,2.5868,3.9566,0.6171,0.8942,1.7291,1.9373,0.0155,2.429,3.8692,9.1106,6.293,0.7367,0.8824,1.6448,2.7413,7.0937,0.6916,0.9971,1.5912,10.2646,0.5558,2.321,6.8633,0.007,2.1459,1.0334,4.0586,0.7693,3.0518,1.1351,4.1208,3.6738,4.7497,4.5023,4.8773,1.3478,1.599,1.8159,2.2373,3.4791,2.8841,5.1342,1.9063,1.5682,6.4364,0.1358,0.0011,6.6327,0.2618,4.049,1.2418,3.4452,2.2534,3.9476,1.6597,3.8448,5.0722,3.0975,1.8805,0.0004,5.5524,1.0404,3.159,2.0033,0.9616,3.5429,4.7655,6.6653,0.7284,2.8569,6.7773,4.5781,0.498,1.1518,1.1649,2.2835,5.1983,0.1185,0.8905,0.5035,2.9382,0.0674,0.0011,4.3845,0.7657,5.0005,5.6397,0.239,0.7591,7.5435,0.0595,0.048,0.743,1.7368,5.4032,3.6026,5.4815,9.4214,4.7326,0.927,1.8689,0.0011,6.8728,0.1883,2.9917,4.5591,0.5979,5.9324,0.727,1.5437,2.5018,0.2979,3.5488,1.1438,5.9849,2.4725,1.1329,5.0877,3.8766,1.8904,1.7475,0.0541,1.7852,1.4951,3.7282,0.3319,2.8773,5.4885,4.5458,0.3049,2.5462,5.9707,0.4741,1.2554,3.3088,0.9378,1.8287,2.9357,3.2192,4.5737,7.1736,2.3357,2.7383,0.9408,0.1238,0.896,5.3528,0.4765,1.0693,2.1642,1.0076,5.5365,5.5521,8.4559,2.5763,3.1657,3.2563,6.3202,1.7695,1.2041,2.1699,5.2649,2.2828,3.3375,6.1704,4.4692,0.0137,2.4204,3.3827,2.517,0.9138,3.1939,6.9785,1.4612,0.0047,0.698,5.8146,0.4382,0.0229,0.0006,1.5453,7.5802,0.034,2.8425,1.2437,1.269,3.721,0.9795,3.3518,0.8197,7.8372,0.463,0.3476,3.0021,5.8246,0.8581,9.2095,7.9737,0.0233,0.0603,2.829,5.026,1.295,1.8503,2.7577,5.1803,2.1886,0.3983,0.5087,1.6398,1.0778,8.3133,0.1162,3.451,2.5853,5.3031,4.684,0.7128,0.5704,2.5484,1.5167,3.1642,5.2745,0.5601,2.6819,4.6439,0.9349,3.4596,0.4002,1.109,1.7916,3.0016,0.0434,0.0012,5.1825,3.7845,0.5165,4.6315,0.7633,3.4518,2.3082,2.0097,0.0609,1.991,0.5674,0.898,3.7544,2.6832,6.6142,0.7283,6.4028,8.2667,2.8345,0.3792,0.8348,2.0633,2.8153,4.7534,3.2241,0.1602,1.0673,1.9612,5.0622,5.6649,6.2551,0.0225,0.297,2.6709,0.0026,0.7266,3.6933,5.9967,0.0098,2.4854,1.5113,0.391,1.1343,5.4783,1.7411,1.9151,1.3482,3.5863,0.4189,1.2088,3.2152,0.7154,0.0103,5.365,2.3302,4.2639,0.7661,3.2324,2.2584,1.7845,2.8104,0.1017,1.452,0.4612,5.7242,1.0874,0.1531,0.986,4.8643,4.0352,2.5521,4.2507,3.2147,2.4281,0.8712,1.6537,2.8956,1.1171,4.9465,3.5132,0.001,2.8684,3.7831,5.9193,2.2298,6.2279,1.6155,1.426,2.0687,0.9351,3.918,2.7064,4.1029,2.3735,1.4023,3.9237,3.6004,1.2906,0.6746,3.4539,1.1111,4.7657,1.3777,1.9955,0.1741,1.9992,3.8923,0.3416,3.1951,2.2454,5.9548,0.0126,0.0612,2.8676,4.1235,5.2045,4.7191,2.4869,3.6368,0.7758,0.3352,1.0384,1.5819,4.2088,0.0561,0.2465,0.6562,5.4102,10.927,5.604,7.0659,5.2748,2.4486,5.4932,1.9104,7.346,0.7551,5.8421,4.1337,3.6629,4.6429,1.3405,2.769,0.2871,1.3424,5.1908,1.4495,4.3186,5.7718,0.0523,6.9988,8.2593,0.8237,2.8114,1.4212,3.4319,0.0018,0.1111,3.9135,4.5803,3.9624,3.7523,6.5706,2.5786,2.4394,2.4166,6.3885,1.9444,3.1843,0.0296,0.0006,1.5324,4.5509,6.3077,7.8598,2.1791,1.0685,1.4178,2.3367,2.1405,2.4688,1.9115,3.8102,1.3301,1.1834,2.9389,1.713,4.9094,0.5204,1.5929,1.0907,0.5164,2.6782,0.0336,3.2925,7.4188,4.439,1.8844,2.3512,3.2912,0.0893,0.1101,1.5137,0.1333,4.6629,5.5261,3.9797,4.4371,0.816,0.3241,0.0008,9.4494,3.3781,1.7698,3.2869,0.9521,5.3989,0.3175,3.6635,5.214,3.3061,2.7479,1.9527]}
{"id":3556,"ended":true,"length":549,"text":"Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as dressage, remain relevant today, as do some of the training methods.\n\nEquitation\n\nA sport of riding. It usually begins while a horse is being trained in dressage, the sport is an exercise of balancing the horse and controlling the motion. It involves the performance of movements with minimal distraction from the horse.\n\nPursuit, Driving, Steeplechase\n\nThoroughbred horse racing is the major competition in the United States. There are many tracks in the country, with the largest being Churchill Downs, which held the Kentucky Derby each year from 1875 through 1986.\n\nSteeplechase horses are often used in the sport as there is no formal course. Horses can gallop as fast as they can go without worrying about time constraints.\n\nRiding is more technical and requires more practice in areas such as balance, control and self restraint.\n\nA horse must be fit and strong to endure the extreme conditions of these endurance races, or races for long periods of time.\n\nDressage\n\nDressage is riding in a very precise and exacting movement. The sport is a refined form of jumping where the rider is focused on the perfection of their riding and their horse. Dressage is the foundation of all other horse sports. It's a performance sport that requires strong and fit horses and skilled riders. Horses are also required to perform their best when pressured and in front of a crowd.\n\nEnglish, Western Jumping\n\nAll the modern disciplines were developed from these two early disciplines.\n\nJumping\n\nA skill in which the objective is to jump over obstacles as high and as far as possible.\n\nHurdling\n\nHurdlers race in the same areas where jumpers do, but they're expected to go less than eight seconds on a flat, which is less than a quarter-mile.\n\nFreestyle\n\nA type of show jumping competition, in which the horse and rider demonstrate various skills. In dressage, for example, a combination of jumps and transitions to show the horse is working well.\n\nDressage\n\nDressage is an equestrian sport that is related to jumping but focused more on the horse's movements and balance.\n\nThe sport involves a horse and rider showing a horse or pony their best work. Dressage may involve movements like extended trotting movements.\n\nJumping\n\nWhile dressage is often practiced on a small course with several small jumps placed together, jumpers compete against each other in a large arena with a series of large jumps placed farther apart and requiring more coordination.\n\nDressage\n\nA performance art in which the focus is on a horse and rider working together.

{"id":4060,"ended":true,"length":593,"text":"Before October 1880, Boycott's situation was little known outside County Mayo. On 14 October of that year, Boycott wrote a letter to The Times about his situation : THE STATE OF ME - [link] Boycot, as you will read, was a man in his 40s, who had worked all his life as a farmer, and in particular, in the rearing of stock, and now, at the age of 43, was at the end of his tether financially, and had no prospect of earning enough money, to sustain his family, unless he left his farm and took up a position and could not find one, and as he was a very hard working man, he could not afford to give up farming. He had tried to employ himself in a mill. However, as a mill requires all your strength, he could not make it his ordinary occupation. There was another mill in the neighbourhood offering a fair salary, but it was a mill which had been in existence for the last half-century and was in a small way, if at all, going to ruin owing to the competition of the steam industry. On the other hand, Boycott could obtain a good post in a factory, but this work also required labour. At this time the wages were quite low. So, as I said, Boycott found himself in a most awkward position. I myself was aware of his situation, and as I had a nephew who was working at the same mill, I could not but help him...\n\nThe site is currently set up for use by guests, only.

Mayo called Castleisland which is located at the mouth of Castle River.He was a blacksmith's journeyman and came from a farmhouse in a hamlet called Templelogue a mile from Castleisland.His mother and father were from Co.

{"id":29,"ended":true,"length":632,"text":"The gods were believed to manifest in many forms. The Egyptians had complex conception of the human soul, consisting of several parts. The spirits of the gods were composed of many of these parts [Katherine Asbury, \"The Soul of a King: The Story of the Pharaoh Hatshepsut,\" p. 16].\nIt may have been out of fear of the influence of \"evil\" gods that they were worshipped. It was the god Osiris who was not a favorite with the ancient Egyptians. It may also have been because the Pharaohs were afraid to be thought different and to have to sacrifice.\n\nIt was said that \"the king's power is the power of Osiris\". One of the oldest temples built by the pharaoh was the Temple of Hathor, where the king was to worship to prevent him from making wrong decisions in his affairs and to keep him safe.\nThe most feared god was Horus, the \"lion-god\", or \"child of the sun\". All that is in this god has both a male and a female aspect, so in the male aspects he was known as \"Horus the son of Set\", and in the female aspect as \"Horus the daughter of Set\". He was believed to receive the powers of Osiris and Seth.\n\nLike all gods Horus was the son of a god and as such he had both male and female aspects. In the male aspect he was known as \"Horus the son of Set\", as he was the older brother to Osiris and Set who was married to Sekhmet, the daughter of Set. He was also the brother of the Egyptian gods Khonsu, the god who presided over the dead, and Khem. The powers of the dead were the ones responsible for the rebirth of the pharaoh. They were believed to be powerful and to have the capability of producing many children to live on.\nHorus as well as the other gods of the Old Kingdom, were also known as \"gods of the dead\".\nAnother god which was worshipped by the pharaohs was Amun, which was one of the names given to the sun-god. This sun god in the ancient Egyptian religion was originally a mortal who became immortal at the feet of his brother Osiris, through his blood.\n\nThe pharaohs would offer up their own blood as a sacrifice for the sun god. One of their ways to pay homage to the sun was to bring him a piece of bread and dip it in a cup of his royal blood. The Pharaonic kings had a very powerful god to which they belonged, so strong that they could even kill another god. With this blood or soul of the king there was the right to rule and to have many privileges.\nWhat kind of power the Egyptians gave to the sun god may be explained by his association with the sun-disc. He was the source of the energy of life. The Egyptian people had a good reason to fear an evil god who could punish a person's soul and cause bad luck.\n\nIt has been speculated that the ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the source of the world's energy and the pharaoh was able to take the power of the sun with him as he traveled through the underworld and to the afterlife which was also called \"the land of eternal life\".","token_len":670,"entropy":[10.5116,3.3493,8.0255,0.0548,8.7745,1.6588,5.2273,1.8683,2.0471,1.8302,5.4919,3.3159,8.5323,7.8247,1.5521,1.0391,4.2096,2.7812,0.9794,7.0497,0.2176,4.1074,2.4879,2.334,1.1814,7.1947,0.7083,1.0507,2.1302,1.1569,5.3796,0.1528,3.0737,5.4377,1.2417,1.8729,7.2776,5.5358,7.2435,8.8966,4.6964,0.8568,2.5525,1.4293,5.0403,0.7194,3.7223,5.6636,2.0631,1.4166,5.0785,0.0651,0.9903,5.5874,8.473,0.0216,0.0002,0.0009,2.3637,2.8938,0.0376,5.5881,1.0515,1.7184,9.1908,3.595,4.075,0.1496,8.3094,0.0341,5.0983,0.7553,1.6389,5.9526,0.0728,7.1173,3.7796,1.4522,3.7385,1.3361,3.8674,2.5653,5.0685,2.2735,3.0503,1.9584,3.7011,5.0983,3.419,0.8797,2.1345,5.6081,2.9375,7.5567,2.2452,0.8153,6.1825,0.2337,0.9736,2.9792,2.1007,2.3574,0.3256,0.0719,2.0497,1.8112,5.7562,0.8844,1.5835,3.8843,2.8304,3.2836,5.8262,7.6406,3.6692,2.2572,3.5193,4.2413,4.2599,4.8901,1.6695,8.4393,3.1584,1.9458,4.0466,0.4743,3.6112,1.288,4.6022,2.9051,4.8628,2.3666,3.0739,2.367,0.4525,3.9873,2.7611,4.938,1.1181,0.1369,4.9265,5.6935,5.315,1.8231,0.7114,7.0338,0.0051,1.8283,3.0053,4.362,0.099,5.1933,0.1411,1.134,3.5591,0.9484,2.3837,1.4818,5.2857,3.4884,6.0992,7.3358,3.7595,0.1733,4.6334,6.8971,1.5623,2.9098,1.621,2.1642,3.0032,1.8081,3.0784,3.0344,2.3308,0.7932,1.3805,15.2301,4.904,6.6709,1.8002,1.4404,4.9017,0.6989,1.136,4.2838,6.5454,1.4729,3.3878,0.2211,1.7525,4.0251,1.1318,7.4144,0.5567,1.2691,3.2325,0.6768,6.1954,4.3555,2.1774,5.1953,2.9791,2.8956,5.4119,7.9293,2.2004,4.1722,0.1603,2.0667,0.0076,2.8123,1.8258,3.1644,4.3649,1.5283,4.9907,4.7917,2.3934,2.1355,3.0221,0.1806,1.2986,3.4887,0.5778,1.2896,2.4925,0.028,7.6964,2.2134,1.7176,0.6112,0.028,0.041,1.8415,1.6574,0.4181,0.5957,0.1268,0.1784,0.7767,0.0022,0.5253,0.2201,3.0504,0.7177,3.463,0.0694,7.6047,1.4277,3.875,0.1813,3.5763,1.7014,7.4833,1.8769,0.8037,0.0003,6.5382,2.0348,1.8339,4.2151,0.9861,3.5827,1.7434,0.0305,3.4989,1.6466,2.7276,4.3469,0.5363,1.8939,2.1844,4.9052,1.5993,0.0343,0.0077,0.7678,0.4059,2.758,1.3653,0.8873,0.547,0.6953,0.2588,0.8753,0.0354,0.8801,0.8732,0.356,0.2169,0.3483,0.0091,0.3533,0.7429,4.271,1.927,0.5878,1.8818,6.8866,0.8334,2.7709,2.8191,1.3968,7.3885,3.8876,1.0632,7.6729,0.1987,8.201,2.1205,0.0477,1.9603,0.9553,1.791,0.0168,2.083,0.3493,2.7364,0.4383,1.3773,1.3308,3.1111,0.2625,2.2311,2.8872,2.9893,5.1421,7.1775,0.9784,1.8383,3.2045,3.4681,3.9382,6.3663,0.0318,0.5096,6.229,1.4097,0.5156,4.1505,4.5006,2.6871,2.624,7.5668,0.2641,2.0581,5.3367,0.9357,3.2461,5.2789,4.6288,0.0181,1.2426,4.6889,0.4299,0.5054,5.8949,0.0118,1.95,4.6907,0.7264,3.6457,0.0467,0.8805,5.6079,1.247,4.0562,2.1121,2.257,5.3095,1.0439,5.1195,4.6428,4.219,3.9254,3.2455,1.5376,1.0428,0.7246,18.4154,0.0704,5.1613,4.6716,0.0526,1.5043,1.9413,0.8482,2.3195,0.8849,4.6957,0.863,2.6835,3.0196,2.9022,1.9598,0.2061,1.1576,5.8355,0.0311,0.3214,1.1184,2.3602,1.0447,2.2378,19.8641,1.2218,4.4485,1.0375,1.9795,1.1462,0.3594,3.0918,0.0028,0.6701,0.4592,6.2542,2.8179,0.7422,4.3937,0.9237,3.9714,0.0446,0.1966,5.2837,1.2052,0.2218,0.8161,6.1868,3.937,0.1669,2.2537,2.9397,5.075,1.2206,6.1937,1.9987,3.4584,1.0358,3.0471,0.7004,6.9389,2.624,6.9795,2.9375,4.6317,2.5264,3.5788,0.5089,8.1405,0.0073,2.1888,3.0719,1.8919,1.649,6.1032,2.0017,4.0206,1.0027,1.8494,0.0004,1.647,2.9676,0.0058,0.122,5.1537,6.179,3.3856,1.9619,2.7654,4.1811,3.0588,1.724,0.8755,1.9748,1.2867,5.0289,0.7244,1.5636,4.1864,0.4628,2.2566,5.5719,1.8034,5.6233,3.9348,0.1191,0.567,0.3364,1.8508,0.5597,4.3917,3.5872,2.1391,4.0245,0.0043,3.6397,1.8457,6.6509,0.4696,0.5997,2.1618,3.8189,0.2965,4.5314,6.9364,0.1065,0.4298,1.5119,6.6983,3.1694,0.0677,3.2664,3.7867,1.7604,3.6174,4.6288,4.4168,4.3382,6.6201,0.4053,6.4273,1.4831,3.567,9.7289,1.6998,0.944,2.023,4.3375,2.7895,6.2257,1.9831,1.5591,6.2387,1.595,1.7082,7.0169,8.2304,3.7098,1.7117,2.4656,4.5437,0.7621,4.2829,5.9782,0.2445,3.6928,2.5503,2.106,3.1603,4.8255,7.7052,0.9555,0.8755,18.2516,4.8623,0.0052,2.7823,3.3097,3.6197,2.6714,1.1244,0.8474,1.0924,0.4498,6.023,1.2187,3.0781,0.6041,2.9238,5.0507,0.0334,0.9513,2.3189,2.5225,9.9305,2.856,2.7189,0.6866,2.0764,5.4071,0.094,1.6181,3.7636,1.4195,3.9968,1.9401,1.903,3.263,4.3981,2.2865,1.601,4.9192,2.6724,1.1021,5.178,5.761,1.7861,0.4574,2.3776,2.1358,7.6178,4.2924,2.1235,3.7667,3.8122,2.3647,4.111,6.758,2.7315,0.554,1.1395,0.0004,3.4092,3.7641,0.277,3.9721,0.1468,0.7687,4.6926,0.1401,2.343,0.3153,0.8173,0.5782,1.9102,1.3333,1.4689,0.0403,1.4143,5.4419,0.6047,0.6812,1.7643,2.8151,3.4629,0.0043,3.3472,4.2081,0.0145,4.9885,2.7012,1.351,0.6442,0.2785,0.1503,3.9831,0.1089,3.8915,1.5139,4.3044,1.8054,0.6533,3.1726,2.0811,3.3632,2.4268,5.0718,5.8664,1.1162,4.2036,2.6494,2.6148,0.6897,3.9687,0.0653,5.8332,0.5103,0.2543]}
{"id":1671,"ended":true,"length":548,"text":"A directed acyclic graph may be used to represent a network of processing elements. In this representation, data enters a processing element through its incoming edges and leaves the element through its outgoing edges. A directed acyclic graph is a special type of graph that contains both, the edges of the graph, and the cycle of the graph itself (or cycles, if graphs with only one cycle are considered). A directed acyclic graph can also contain cycles with smaller total number of edges than the original graph.\nA directed acyclic graph can be defined by its vertex, labeled with the value of every node of the graph except its own, as well as an edge between any two vertices labeled with the same value. Every cycle may also be found in a directed acyclic graph by looking for pairs of vertices labeled with different values.\nA known method for constructing directed acyclic graphs is to define a graph as a directed acyclic subset (\u201cDAS\u201d) of a graph. The directed acyclic graph formed by a DAS is given by the union of all directed acyclic graphs of the DAS, where each directed acyclic graph is constructed by taking its DAS as its starting vertex. For instance, a directed acyclic graph where vertex a is the union of all elements a \u2208 A and b \u2208 B is defined as a directed acyclic graph of the form: \u02dcA=b\u2295a, i.e., the corresponding DAS is defined as: \u02dcA=A\u2295b, i.e. the directed acyclic subset in the DAS.\nA graph can also be defined using a directed acyclic group (\u201cDAG\u201d) instead of a DAS. A DAG is a structure in which each element can be represented by a pair, called the adjacency list of the element, which is a sequence of elements representing the adjacency of vertices and edges of the DAG. FIG. 1 shows an example of a DAG. The adjacency list of a vertex may start at the vertex's label and end at the vertex itself.\nIn the prior art, it is often necessary and desirable to create directed acyclic graphs on a large scale to simulate complex or large-scale distributed computing systems, distributed data processing systems, and the like. This requires storing and manipulating directed acyclic graphs on very large scale storage systems. However, the use of these storage systems can be problematic. First, for large memory and computational resources, the operations used to maintain directed acyclic graphs can be expensive operations, making large-scale directed acyclic graphs inefficient for large-scale use. Even when large-scale operations are not necessary (for example, storing a directed acyclic graph in memory), maintenance of directed acyclic graphs can still be a burden, because of difficulties in creating directed acyclic graphs of large size. In particular, it is difficult to find and maintain directed acyclic graphs that are exactly the graph desired to be created and stored, which may create a significant burden on system resources.","token_len":670,"entropy":[10.9834,7.6037,5.7688,0.0717,0.7439,8.297,7.262,1.0706,1.8312,0.8634,4.5087,1.8841,6.3693,1.0398,9.9323,3.5631,1.5574,2.905,1.4365,7.2698,0.2967,5.4347,8.267,1.8407,4.478,1.0101,3.3722,3.4271,8.4822,6.9687,1.2782,5.1844,1.104,5.7973,3.812,0.1832,2.5239,0.0573,0.2837,3.0397,3.4749,0.3242,0.0019,0.0066,0.001,0.0124,1.4348,1.349,6.6715,1.5277,0.0661,0.5202,1.2093,3.5268,3.9632,6.6648,3.5723,3.9814,0.8454,1.4418,0.4242,1.5154,0.2608,0.891,10.3719,1.0483,1.3173,0.4525,4.4006,3.432,3.4885,5.4978,3.6933,1.6241,8.7719,5.2804,4.0014,1.6327,3.91,0.4365,3.4376,1.6095,1.9552,0.9383,0.0409,0.002,0.0034,0.0005,0.0039,2.3561,1.8342,1.8987,6.2911,4.1063,6.9179,7.4336,2.0847,0.0578,0.7582,2.2818,1.9239,4.2416,0.1914,0.602,1.3383,11.7416,0.6899,0.0193,0.0028,0.0054,0.0007,0.003,1.6596,1.4489,4.0799,1.8034,3.9738,5.5157,4.0593,8.8715,2.4469,1.6224,4.5865,0.6655,7.6548,2.5545,2.3974,0.4444,0.113,6.6891,2.8723,4.0002,2.7639,3.0234,2.8533,0.0027,4.2782,2.6213,5.3195,4.5376,1.0487,3.0258,0.0001,4.1219,0.6829,0.7617,2.0926,1.0464,0.5618,6.3859,5.3444,4.4998,2.8835,1.9165,7.1486,1.4076,1.2211,1.2299,0.1097,0.0034,0.0041,0.0007,0.0065,1.6852,4.6589,2.164,6.0904,0.2657,2.3284,0.0003,2.0672,0.4375,3.1355,0.4799,1.1837,1.5771,1.6033,8.5978,5.1887,1.2714,3.5544,1.3977,0.0172,0.0039,0.0035,0.0133,0.1597,0.4119,0.8901,3.1551,0.9097,2.1595,2.754,0.923,3.8398,0.598,0.0053,0.0146,0.0026,8.5906,3.0959,10.3573,7.3421,5.7164,6.1951,4.8004,6.4348,2.1301,1.9149,1.3903,0.7929,1.3569,1.7684,3.5739,0.062,0.0024,0.0034,0.0016,1.9534,7.7238,0.7204,1.9283,5.8561,0.045,1.3008,5.5616,0.5021,0.9449,9.5933,0.4405,2.0899,6.6944,0.0953,0.0105,0.0071,0.0254,1.3081,3.0292,0.9995,4.7119,0.0178,2.5627,4.3002,1.2409,2.9074,0.0089,0.0024,0.0031,0.0005,0.142,0.922,5.7662,1.2711,3.9595,3.155,5.6768,0.0309,1.6675,1.1408,3.9801,2.1472,1.3526,3.1217,3.4744,0.0608,1.9584,2.0882,0.0278,0.0028,0.0034,0.0006,0.2415,5.3222,4.8829,6.2252,0.744,1.6737,7.5842,0.3259,0.5061,6.2486,6.0415,6.3695,1.159,3.9027,1.8002,1.3111,0.296,0.0013,0.6304,1.542,2.9869,0.7574,1.8258,1.0214,0.0056,0.002,0.0023,0.0004,0.2159,2.3793,1.5832,2.4697,0.9644,6.8453,6.4263,1.8039,4.8613,1.578,5.4823,0.8816,1.129,4.4576,2.3734,6.3656,0.5599,0.0025,0.1364,2.0847,6.5065,3.4668,0.0112,1.5998,3.0641,0.3896,1.2139,0.8054,0.0183,0.7281,0.3587,2.8398,1.164,0.0558,0.0108,1.4949,1.0865,0.3205,0.003,0.0009,3.9561,0.7303,5.3666,0.0218,0.0025,0.0023,0.0006,3.5434,4.5075,0.9673,1.0921,0.0019,2.4215,0.8227,2.1323,3.6214,2.2296,1.8113,0.3105,1.5703,2.5919,1.2759,2.4244,0.1601,0.0039,0.0041,0.001,5.4623,1.7684,1.1227,0.4279,1.0237,5.4534,0.339,0.2365,0.811,5.4602,0.0538,0.6056,1.8175,0.0708,0.6127,2.2151,0.7596,0.8153,0.8339,0.9153,5.5141,3.5251,0.3306,2.1063,2.0169,4.6099,0.452,2.0729,1.056,0.8437,4.8245,4.8086,3.8104,1.8454,5.6745,1.4649,0.1475,4.9885,3.9237,1.1857,4.5651,2.062,2.9731,1.0585,1.7565,4.3809,0.1246,2.8434,4.5031,1.2592,2.6304,0.0319,0.0201,1.3629,6.2558,0.0014,3.2616,0.8103,1.5106,0.575,5.1372,3.1473,0.4131,9.524,0.0956,2.3842,1.3124,1.6995,0.7299,0.5118,0.4221,1.3291,0.0594,2.4249,1.6154,1.7913,0.0062,0.0035,0.1036,1.1374,1.4137,5.966,3.3884,6.6584,1.4636,1.2348,2.0496,3.2518,6.5862,1.3165,1.1517,0.1802,0.7423,1.2361,3.4495,0.4661,2.3823,2.1351,1.5076,6.0419,1.3146,0.5351,4.0911,0.7028,3.1034,2.3904,6.4852,1.1534,0.1816,3.2635,4.0574,0.0203,0.0027,0.0017,0.0064,0.6632,4.6426,1.467,4.2794,1.2256,2.9944,5.6472,4.1927,5.3354,3.2142,1.1922,0.0189,4.9881,1.5949,2.656,2.5843,8.6655,3.7974,1.7033,1.5639,0.2547,1.5066,4.6919,0.0722,0.1166,3.4614,3.9476,8.1771,2.1199,2.0144,3.7215,0.0099,0.0031,0.0024,0.0041,0.5726,1.8398,5.5152,0.1748,1.8324,6.6687,2.3874,1.1453,3.4787,0.0095,2.0863,4.0781,0.016,5.2167,2.8245,0.1687,2.0456,1.1652,6.4409,2.3511,4.3572,0.2483,4.3803,2.2088,6.3408,2.8733,5.1238,3.8402,0.3766,2.0306,5.636,3.3883,0.862,5.1929,2.0512,0.004,0.0044,0.0026,0.0013,0.1488,1.6941,0.6721,3.9513,8.6666,1.9198,4.7574,5.0276,1.1227,0.0102,4.5685,0.0041,0.0021,0.0017,0.003,0.1101,4.4664,2.4011,1.5453,1.1326,0.0315,5.6884,0.6785,6.2799,3.1853,3.1321,0.4741,0.0116,2.7934,0.2448,3.9283,1.609,3.5934,1.9768,0.3045,0.1393,4.4667,2.2073,5.8997,0.0216,0.0022,0.0039,0.0006,0.3105,1.5923,1.7245,1.0842,9.4858,0.7331,0.7713,0.0017,0.0033,0.0037,0.0004,0.1202,1.0452,3.4249,0.4642,2.3306,5.0273,2.6768,2.584,2.5027,8.4115,0.7286,4.5896,2.3797,0.0053,0.0023,0.0031,0.0007,0.1535,3.8864,2.0534,1.6826,0.6011,2.7814,2.3778,0.0025,3.1269,0.5001,2.9946,0.1958,4.0449,3.2621,0.5016,2.9568,0.0055,0.0028,0.0033,0.001,0.2393,1.4268,0.7131,7.2342,0.9362,9.0615,5.7031,3.9009,1.0505,2.3984,3.3319,2.8735,2.6227,3.3344,2.3546,4.6003,2.2887,2.7452,3.6523,0.8056,4.5255,1.6817,0.4839]}

{"id":4936,"ended":true,"length":577,"text":"Maulbetsch started his college football career at age 21, leading Adrian College to an 8 \u2013 0 record in 1911, including a 15 \u2013 0 win over the University of Michigan freshman team. He spent 1912 playing for the University of Chicago, winning a conference championship and leading the Fighting Illini to the National Championship final against Yale.\n\nIn 1913 he transferred to the University of Washington and was the MVP of the season-opening game of the 1914 season against the University of Oregon. His final season at Washington, he led the team to win the Pacific Coast Athletic Association. He was also captain of the team.\n\nHe later served as president of the Washington State Athletic Assn.\n\n\u201cYou had to try hard to get good coaches back in those days... But as luck would have it he wasn\u2019t one of the ordinary guys,\u201d said Bill Cotterell, the author of the Washington State University biography, \u201cDixie\u2019s Son\u201d and a retired Seattle television producer. \u201cI think all of his teammates wanted him to succeed as a coach. He wanted to go into coaching because he knew it had to do with winning, and I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s known for: winning.\u201d\n\nMaulbetsch went on to coach as well as playing professional football. When he graduated from Washington in 1915, he was named the head coach of the New York Yanks of the Federal League \u2014 an expansion of the sport\u2019s minor-league structure. Later that year, he led the Yanks to the league championship.\n\nThe Federal League then collapsed after one season. With the collapse of the league, the professional football system of allowing players to make a living \u2014 both off the field and on \u2014 also went into a tailspin. Many players lost their way, and many found themselves broke.\n\nThat\u2019s when Maulbetsch decided to join the Army and serve his country during World War I.\n\n\u201cHis father was a Civil War veteran, his grandfather,\u201d Cotterell said. \u201cJust in the family. So it was kind of a tradition to go into the service.\u201d\n\nAdvertising\n\nMaulbetsch was an intelligence officer and took part in the fighting in France and elsewhere. He eventually returned to Washington, took a couple of years off and, because of his football connections, made a return to the coaching ranks.\n\nIn 1927, he took over in a similar role as his father.

{"id":356,"ended":true,"length":605,"text":"In 2004, GM Larry Kaufman expressed a more nuanced view than Adams and Berliner, arguing that the initiative stemming from the first move can always be transformed into some sort of enduring advantage, even if the player doesn't necessarily succeed.\n\nThe basic idea here is to play the game at a level, say, a level 6, that puts you out of the competition for first through seventh. But now you get the chance to move up; what if you win with a 6.5?\n\nIf you are serious about becoming stronger at this game, you need to look at your playing strength and use it in some form. That means developing a play strategy as well.\n\nSo the way you should play your first move is to improve the position of your pawn group in the center. That's not as easy as it may seem at first.\n\nAfter a careful study we've arrived at a set of rules which we have decided to use.\n\n\"One is that the game is played in the form of simultaneous chess, which means that all moves are known. The second is that the board has no white or black spaces. The third, or fundamental principle, of the game, and one that we use in every move, is that, as long as one has a pawn where one is, the game is played. \"We call this principle the 'pawn rule,' and we always keep it in mind, although at times it is difficult to know when it really applies.\n\nThe aim is to set up a rook-bishop for check of the other player's king. But to achieve this aim you probably have to sacrifice a pawn (move the pawn group away from the right side of the diagram) or two pawns, and that's just not a serious possibility.\n\nThere are also different kinds of checks made by a bishop. Sometimes it's a c2-c3 check against a pawn group on the diagonals, but there is also the well-known check against a king pawn which is c3-f6.\n\nTo be more specific, any move is a check once it is made against a pawn in the same rank which may be on either side of a king.\n\nThe first move of the piece takes place on any square. The rule is that it may be either an attack or check. If it is an attack, it must result in immediate check at c3, c4, c5, f6, g5 or g6 and f5 or f6.\n\nThe third rule is that a check can be avoided or avoided by responding to it; thus, if one checks at b1, b2 the other player may prevent it by moving his or her pawn to b3, b4 or b5 and thereby avoiding it.\n\nIn response, one can move his or her pieces to f6, g6, g7, b6, b7 or b8.\n\nA pawn's value and importance is determined by its number of active squares. The pawn can make only one move in a movement. In the usual game, the pawn moves along its active diagonal. Here the bishop moves in exactly the same manner but is restricted to the two-square space along the diagonal from g7 to b6.","token_len":671,"entropy":[8.8503,0.1818,8.624,11.4031,7.8687,7.2462,2.6884,6.2264,3.4075,0.6459,3.4496,8.7818,2.3128,10.7076,3.4091,1.5878,4.057,0.174,1.5194,8.7025,12.5316,0.0209,0.8187,5.8211,7.709,5.6963,7.5383,0.4161,6.6249,0.7127,5.8842,1.4835,0.0007,9.3089,7.7564,2.6824,3.2388,0.6614,1.666,6.4808,3.3749,0.001,3.9962,4.5755,0.6407,0.8344,0.0003,2.7703,7.2425,1.0873,3.2035,0.3156,2.1825,5.2845,1.7613,1.196,3.8607,1.1842,2.2498,4.8044,4.4934,0.4704,3.7222,2.7352,6.2669,2.124,3.7252,5.3908,1.9671,4.9569,0.3604,2.2456,3.9985,1.852,4.2131,9.6758,2.2632,1.657,3.1089,5.95,2.0252,4.1154,3.2082,2.286,0.0238,4.3261,0.9795,7.1492,5.5041,1.6995,0.4739,4.3891,4.826,1.4703,4.2118,5.1548,1.7755,1.2956,1.9185,0.0001,3.4837,0.5101,4.0336,7.6688,0.0641,4.3671,7.1326,3.5169,2.63,4.2619,0.2982,0.9035,1.5644,0.2092,5.0162,0.7168,3.2446,4.8319,6.8422,2.0125,6.0519,1.4672,2.6696,3.8237,3.1877,0.6082,3.4514,2.6835,5.0487,1.8178,5.9443,5.0012,5.1618,2.327,3.0332,1.04,0.0001,4.4262,3.55,4.8741,1.999,5.4215,1.8454,2.5019,4.1037,1.645,0.7455,0.8667,5.9689,3.6486,4.5109,0.8958,0.4662,6.9304,10.5768,3.052,1.2013,5.2824,2.0603,2.8451,2.1411,3.3301,3.8015,1.651,0.1149,0.7501,5.0641,0.7879,3.0877,0.0056,1.1583,1.1559,0.0001,5.2508,2.7756,6.3306,2.5118,6.5058,2.2493,5.5316,0.0032,1.3534,4.4169,0.2221,2.582,3.8166,3.2581,4.1885,4.9141,0.8402,2.2094,2.6486,1.326,0.0001,5.5701,4.9075,4.8039,2.5017,1.9201,3.5115,1.671,2.5909,1.8022,2.3019,5.1744,0.039,7.384,5.4875,4.9089,2.237,1.9964,0.5532,3.8604,1.4416,1.218,6.4652,2.9854,2.1345,3.0882,0.6528,0.1647,1.2312,5.2178,3.002,2.4847,6.8293,2.9595,0.7036,4.4389,1.5489,1.2741,0.22,4.046,4.783,9.0737,3.1857,0.8014,3.6268,1.2222,0.2576,1.4862,4.7692,2.804,2.0528,2.471,3.758,1.6586,2.4465,2.599,0.5863,0.0945,0.5833,4.4745,3.0842,2.2409,0.0063,2.8893,3.3873,1.5222,3.4087,5.4759,1.7141,2.2505,5.221,1.6507,1.0777,0.8437,1.7934,2.9355,4.2607,4.316,2.9587,0.5913,4.1002,2.1999,1.571,4.2039,0.234,3.693,2.3043,1.4697,1.8404,5.7447,3.9712,0.939,1.3928,0.1608,2.8705,5.2286,4.5875,0.8579,0.8964,2.4369,3.0317,0.3068,3.0267,3.5687,1.53,4.5695,3.3218,1.3857,3.0517,0.0002,2.6972,7.6145,1.1664,0.4334,5.6068,0.9244,0.9559,6.9465,3.6456,5.6641,4.1055,10.2255,5.6119,1.2247,5.0047,2.3092,0.9498,3.3923,1.2577,3.477,4.5765,3.9242,0.4403,5.4191,2.1092,7.2731,1.2238,0.0312,5.915,1.4762,1.6628,4.6525,6.9686,2.8087,2.1732,9.2245,4.391,0.0526,0.5377,6.1453,2.1118,0.4508,0.0694,7.7538,1.306,1.7398,2.6959,2.8812,0.0316,2.1646,2.1256,3.608,1.026,3.3718,2.8476,2.9381,7.417,5.1705,0.3237,1.2227,0.0002,3.9773,0.4854,3.0236,4.91,2.9151,0.0026,6.0456,6.0139,2.0417,3.5057,4.4272,1.5343,4.6178,2.1168,0.7175,2.2887,6.9929,5.2784,2.9229,1.0085,0.4818,2.7936,5.3034,0.769,2.8622,5.331,4.0235,0.5085,7.5048,0.0164,0.5955,0.8666,2.127,3.6201,1.6259,1.7795,3.1202,9.0158,0.3487,0.1315,3.443,2.6511,0.7247,2.8378,6.4141,4.2838,1.357,7.2499,1.2161,0.7265,4.7882,2.4285,0.9176,1.4103,0.0002,4.4894,3.2514,3.4087,1.1743,0.2567,6.0736,1.4609,3.4258,2.2009,1.4083,7.8693,1.5525,1.3152,1.6046,2.7983,0.6695,1.3517,3.6464,0.6762,2.7934,7.4989,5.9529,4.899,1.2041,3.8059,3.8058,0.4738,0.1967,2.0859,3.9328,1.0142,1.3614,0.0002,2.1049,2.93,2.8139,1.917,0.7006,6.1276,6.1853,0.7513,1.8625,5.9226,4.4816,2.9011,1.8208,7.0111,1.464,0.8957,3.1923,4.2063,0.6309,4.3844,3.675,3.6286,1.0517,4.9886,1.4279,2.3603,1.5177,0.7717,1.0259,0.027,0.6491,1.156,2.1909,7.3365,0.145,7.2685,3.3876,5.045,7.0167,1.7435,1.6868,3.9432,0.5892,0.4996,1.3943,0.068,0.5255,5.824,0.5778,0.6464,3.7204,3.1572,2.3021,1.4529,0.2199,4.5354,7.5796,2.773,1.8136,0.838,0.2027,0.6783,1.1358,0.0002,1.5764,3.8153,4.3794,0.5415,0.504,2.7971,2.3507,3.8903,0.8664,7.7756,4.3741,2.8776,2.0109,8.0751,0.6834,4.047,5.5548,6.0675,1.4043,1.7369,3.0229,5.3012,4.1568,3.2622,3.3938,0.9044,0.9232,0.2205,5.5654,3.3107,2.8314,2.6017,6.1325,1.4173,1.8046,3.4353,3.5923,4.8168,0.0062,0.9059,2.0379,2.0296,1.5208,1.5665,1.1294,0.1135,1.6004,0.0331,0.0663,2.7235,4.4719,3.116,1.3012,0.3277,0.4802,0.0002,3.0775,7.164,2.2494,2.7771,1.9167,2.5558,1.9088,0.1109,0.0018,4.8512,1.3738,3.4331,1.2959,1.2115,2.4999,1.2158,0.9454,1.387,0.0715,0.9995,2.3845,1.6926,0.8038,0.7997,0.215,0.9885,0.1762,0.4785,1.1301,1.0087,0.0001,4.0222,2.3631,3.4474,5.9341,4.4779,5.6171,2.3345,1.2274,0.2914,1.1424,3.6532,0.346,5.9354,2.8076,0.9504,2.0498,2.5703,3.7551,5.806,3.9925,0.3508,0.66,2.6254,1.3671,4.1835,1.3195,3.4052,1.98,5.4741,2.7621,1.1206,1.6375,0.9891,2.5708,6.3505,2.9696,5.2956,6.307,1.9183,5.7822,2.0337,6.7626,2.051,2.6775,6.3751,0.2948,0.1159,2.829,4.2147,3.4583,7.6514,0.3297,2.2782,4.2497,3.8794,2.5958,4.5336,7.2823,0.7229,0.8634,5.9025,6.0384,3.0861,0.5354,1.4875,1.4862,0.3696]}
{"id":332,"ended":true,"length":568,"text":"After World War I, Transylvania proclaimed union with the Kingdom of Romania. As a result, in April 1919, the newly established Hungarian Soviet Republic vowed to retake the region by force. The United Kingdom, France and the US intervened, creating a buffer zone around Tarnacs. Romania signed the Treatise of Trianon (3 May 1920 ), with the Soviet Union as well, by which it retained Transylvania (except the areas lost in 1918 ). The Treaty of Trianon established administrative boundaries between Romania and Hungary (see table).\n\nThe Treaty of Budapest, signed on 4 December 1921, was a compromise that saw Tarnacs divided into two halves again. Romania had lost Tarnacs to Hungary after the war, and in return it was given Transylvania to form a buffer state between Hungary and Romania.\n\nThe population of Transylvania consisted mainly of a Hungarian majority, which was joined by more than a million people of Romanian origin, who moved there following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Romanian refugees from Hungary settled also in Northern Transylvania. The Hungarian nationalist Party of the Hungarians had been in power in Transylvania for some time. At the same time, Transylvania remained part of Hungary. Between 1847 and 1849, the Hungarian revolutionary Count Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi seized large swathes of Transylvania by force. Count Sz\u00e9chenyi wanted to create a Hungarian empire known as \u201cLittle Russia \u201d, but failed only after the intervention of Russian troops.\n\nTransylvania remained under Hungarian suzerainty and the national language was Hungarian. The first election in Tarnacs was held in 1927. In the elections in Transylvania on 20 April 1926, the Hungarian Socialist Party made impressive gains. The first local Hungarian government under a Communist minister was established there on 10 September 1928.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II was followed by severe repression against the anti-Nazi movement. According to a study, only 10,000 Hungarian citizens perished during the War. Only 3,000 were killed by the Nazi occupation forces. In October 1944, over 1,500 Hungarian refugees were allowed to settle in Transylvania.\n\nThe Communist regime was established in Hungary after the war as a result of an agreement between Hungary and Romania. After Hungary\u2019s incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1945, communist leader Josip Broz Tito ruled the country and established a new Hungarian Socialist Republic. With the aid of the Soviet army, Tito\u2019s government brought Hungary under central control.\n\nThe Transylvanian authorities adopted the new Soviet style of government in 1947. In Transylvania, the new government headed by the Hungarian Communist Party. The first election in Transylvania under the new regime was held on 23 February 1947. The Hungarian Communist Party obtained 100 out of 119 seats in parliament.\n\nAfter the death of Tito in 1980, the Soviet invasion of Hungary and the Soviet Union\u2019s subsequent dissolution, the Hungarian Socialist Republic became a republic in the Kingdom of Hungary (or Republic of Hungary ). In 1991, the Hungarian Parliament abolished the Hungarian Socialist Republic and adopted the text of the Republic\u2019s declaration of independence.","token_len":672,"entropy":[8.6336,0.0961,2.138,0.3971,10.501,2.4631,0.076,0.0002,9.8977,9.6208,0.3152,1.8584,4.0623,0.0481,4.0813,1.0045,4.2601,1.2147,0.3565,0.3572,4.0882,5.0943,3.4868,0.2782,1.2233,4.5585,2.3472,5.7599,5.2643,1.8285,9.7435,0.2659,8.3393,1.0867,3.2484,3.7626,0.9259,0.9556,1.873,4.6407,1.5201,2.1607,3.181,1.3684,1.887,4.9029,5.2959,2.3357,4.9278,0.9674,5.8926,0.3101,2.1571,6.1178,4.5466,9.3066,1.3128,4.0133,5.3622,0.8724,7.6241,4.5968,0.8522,3.5634,4.3795,0.0023,2.7579,8.1892,2.8847,2.3427,7.8545,4.5243,1.0554,3.8065,0.1871,2.4163,6.135,4.6064,6.1742,1.0466,1.4159,6.0122,7.383,0.0303,0.0098,0.0032,4.6262,4.9945,3.7465,5.8018,6.8014,2.0414,3.8825,7.3778,1.9379,1.6421,0.2552,1.7077,0.145,0.0062,4.8239,8.7775,2.6094,2.7617,2.2161,0.0999,1.5558,2.9773,2.8839,4.433,3.0382,1.4957,0.0923,1.8229,1.6949,0.1747,4.9197,2.7558,1.2121,1.1758,3.7851,3.2947,2.0005,0.2498,2.9186,2.1249,4.4134,2.7289,4.3247,4.3944,1.8154,0.0231,4.054,0.6656,1.3102,3.5623,8.5677,1.0534,4.3728,3.1828,4.6824,3.5837,0.267,0.019,2.1774,2.7862,4.0697,1.2276,2.0918,0.7772,1.1696,3.1352,3.9533,3.5499,2.4156,2.0265,4.4295,0.0061,0.0082,0.0087,3.5412,3.0456,0.8522,6.0643,3.6851,2.9153,2.8807,0.0417,0.8113,0.3191,2.6271,0.0002,1.5832,7.796,0.3508,0.9456,0.0003,0.0069,0.0017,5.1213,1.7267,0.0088,4.0601,6.7521,4.846,1.1763,3.8867,1.5849,6.868,0.5918,4.5594,0.4744,2.3748,1.846,3.6236,1.2966,2.3449,1.11,1.8735,2.1896,5.182,4.1734,5.4502,0.4178,5.4821,0.0163,0.298,4.34,0.0059,0.0062,0.0014,0.0014,0.4331,1.0961,6.052,4.1032,2.0122,2.5892,3.9525,8.3533,0.2569,6.9832,2.6727,0.0006,0.0114,0.0013,1.1605,1.9075,3.375,6.7342,3.9443,0.9031,1.4116,5.2159,0.0109,3.5571,2.7311,3.2152,0.2518,1.8469,1.2593,0.0003,0.0078,0.0012,0.9928,2.8337,0.6378,1.4395,4.5001,0.4682,2.3303,0.0039,0.2166,4.1372,0.0015,0.0114,0.0034,4.1906,3.0317,0.0017,1.7224,1.7053,5.4445,3.1183,4.7776,0.0895,0.5582,2.7151,0.2346,1.3995,0.878,6.5357,10.3228,5.9166,3.1069,1.2818,0.1476,2.6327,3.1059,6.7792,5.1247,5.5218,6.0296,2.9322,0.0002,0.0124,0.9284,0.0004,0.0077,0.0011,4.6004,0.3531,0.9512,6.868,0.866,0.0421,0.0008,0.0069,6.1071,0.5013,3.8884,0.315,3.0192,5.2928,6.4967,0.0407,11.7823,5.661,9.9535,4.796,2.0725,7.4677,3.8672,2.503,5.5184,9.4133,2.8676,1.7705,5.8921,0.0226,4.1313,2.7119,0.7484,1.616,0.0001,3.5679,0.0132,0.0142,0.0023,3.1048,2.6605,1.7177,10.0343,0.0303,0.0003,0.0031,4.2114,3.0362,6.3435,4.0411,1.4666,3.0052,0.5121,1.6797,4.4457,7.923,1.618,3.8742,0.1449,0.0179,1.1091,0.2426,1.0094,5.0703,1.0839,2.1388,2.5278,4.2022,2.3882,5.4145,0.0007,0.0109,0.0017,3.3131,3.6862,2.6531,3.5379,0.0972,1.478,1.7949,3.3326,0.3224,5.5779,8.5733,0.0559,1.3899,1.4598,2.9254,6.1773,5.5931,3.4148,6.6544,4.5028,4.7752,7.9996,1.2054,3.4435,5.532,2.2422,3.8075,2.9884,2.1227,0.4191,1.8409,0.0002,1.5349,8.0249,0.0041,1.5858,0.0029,0.8883,3.0593,2.3959,0.1144,6.1245,4.2149,3.6893,1.1741,5.5948,0.0152,3.3449,3.2401,1.2397,5.3446,0.0014,2.8892,3.976,4.5726,3.7319,3.4751,1.9072,0.3361,2.6038,2.3736,6.3071,1.3691,0.389,5.5448,0.9998,5.062,3.136,0.2819,0.5846,1.9076,1.4751,1.7942,1.1767,2.8664,2.7244,1.6378,0.9063,2.3128,4.035,2.335,0.2216,4.8192,2.0268,0.4107,2.0318,2.0883,3.5173,1.0414,5.2429,0.2009,3.0952,0.1432,2.7247,0.0005,0.0088,0.0015,0.6439,1.3213,0.0002,1.6633,5.3081,3.7375,2.4169,4.5565,0.6751,3.534,3.0081,0.6112,2.2195,4.5783,1.0437,2.875,0.0018,3.8658,0.5226,0.6704,2.4616,0.0623,2.0879,0.9819,3.671,4.1992,15.0685,6.447,2.3734,5.9207,0.4022,0.2312,1.3803,0.0113,0.9409,3.1209,0.0872,6.7062,5.3509,6.5511,0.7666,1.4579,0.6875,0.0459,0.03,5.5472,2.066,0.3677,2.8466,3.2839,1.411,2.8515,3.5654,4.2505,1.1125,0.9411,5.4268,0.6981,4.6248,0.0275,0.9073,1.9149,6.6803,0.5006,2.7711,0.0003,10.4636,0.3909,0.5362,1.6191,5.1246,4.2341,1.7534,7.1208,0.2667,1.0315,1.7652,0.0002,1.6821,4.2311,0.0154,4.8347,0.0256,5.9373,4.873,1.3308,3.615,3.7949,7.0057,0.1063,0.5705,1.5842,4.1611,0.6977,2.2304,7.2927,0.0009,0.1731,0.001,0.2795,1.1088,2.5479,1.4308,5.8816,0.0187,2.0881,2.3063,1.5847,0.1762,4.5866,1.5622,3.2255,6.0236,1.1337,2.1827,0.0009,0.0135,0.0003,6.2689,1.0898,0.8944,1.699,0.7145,0.1335,0.4661,3.5898,2.5277,2.6256,0.3557,1.4314,3.4026,1.0615,0.0668,7.0653,5.4875,6.2359,0.0046,6.9929,0.0877,0.41,2.6579,0.8623,1.4477,0.0002,3.5802,0.5045,4.9315,0.0483,2.7124,0.0003,0.9127,5.4595,0.0784,0.8594,3.2824,6.2712,0.2375,1.7328,2.8915,0.7558,3.9949,2.2903,6.3284,0.2866,0.0883,4.8338,4.8971,2.2798,1.2227,2.3131,3.332,1.3764,2.3918,1.2246,3.0784,2.3999,3.5158,7.1195,0.0274,2.0651,2.9482,4.7144,4.7486,0.3527,1.0196,6.1844,2.3503,3.1004,0.1849,0.8201,1.3631,4.6502,5.0051,0.515,1.9338,2.3839,1.167,1.4911,3.7904,0.8329,8.2571,0.2197,0.2093,4.6603,3.2384,0.0421,0.1867,6.3234,0.9078,0.1862,1.0312]}
{"id":1890,"ended":true,"length":605,"text":"As the annual dole grew larger the Easter distribution became increasingly popular. In 1808 a broadside featuring a woodcut of the twins and a brief history of their alleged story was sold outside the church gates at \u00a31 each. The following year, in a much improved layout, the story appeared in two parts, together with details of donations that had been received for publication, the largest of which was \"A New Pamphlet on the true History of the Life of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ\", by Rev W Gee at \u00a3400.\n\nThe tale remained popular for another quarter of a century, but it was not alone in attracting attention. A pantomime of the Nativity had been presented by the company of The Children's Friend and was advertised in January as \"the Great English pantomime for the year 1816\". Among its actors was \"J. Baily, a very popular gentleman\", \"the remarkable Miss Mme de Moustier\", and the \"famed actress Mrs Brownlow\". In the preface, Brownlow complained of being \"forbidden to act the part\" of the Holy Virgin. She was, or had been, a member of the Ladies' Guild in the Guildhall and was the subject of a popular pamphlet called A Letter from Our Lilliput, published in February 1816.\n\nIn his 1816 calendar, John Hunt includes the first pantomime in the Old Town, which was performed as far back as 1812 and was staged again in 1816. He says little about it, other than to describe it as a \"Christmas pantomime\", and does not give its name. In 1830 the pantomime was described simply in the programme as \"The Great English pantomime\", in a way that left no doubt of its authorship. The story was of a little boy called Fanny who was found wandering in the forest and rescued by the King's Fairy and his wife. His sister, who was of course the Queen, is transformed into a mouse, which is then rescued along with the boy. At the end, the King and Queen promise to restore the fairy's domain. The show was based on a farce by a little known Italian. Like many pantomimes at the time, it was intended for adults as well as children and took as its basis an actual incident from history. This time it was the abduction of Margaret of Austria from her birthplace, Coronaria, by the Turks in 1576. She was taken after her marriage to Rudolf III of Habsburg, Duke of Austria. Like the original, it was told from the point of view of the Sultan and depicted variously the trials of the boy and his sister, the subsequent escape, the subsequent betrayal, the recapture and the final escape.\n\nThe story has been described by the Rev J. W. Moulton in his book From Aesop and Chaucer to Dickens (1927) as a \"peculiarly original and charming production\", which has been praised for its \"ingenious dialogue\", its \"wonderful scenery\", its \"fairy music\", its \"droll characters\" and for the \"unpretentious but very amusing\" direction of the dancing which helped to \"reform the pantomime\".","token_len":674,"entropy":[2.9307,8.3902,9.501,2.1977,7.8469,4.3676,5.0959,11.3412,8.4026,2.6552,2.7519,4.6007,1.0761,2.5099,3.1574,4.7872,3.1546,7.6681,5.1651,8.2583,2.202,8.4335,1.1999,1.8592,1.5671,9.5671,3.0408,1.4864,5.9021,4.7729,0.0802,1.9652,7.962,6.7231,0.8603,5.6711,6.8927,1.1859,2.7207,6.8612,2.7034,4.6032,2.5045,3.9608,0.4123,2.0081,3.6938,0.0537,2.1374,2.5276,2.3079,5.8997,6.4623,6.4209,0.5804,1.0485,5.6376,3.5983,0.8737,4.5948,4.7398,1.7594,6.732,0.6452,6.7343,0.7809,10.0066,4.7194,2.0864,0.7873,2.4705,3.373,8.6725,3.0708,3.6272,6.6952,1.7486,0.0483,0.5498,6.2056,2.7033,4.1322,6.411,3.3471,0.1039,1.7276,0.8349,8.8242,3.007,0.0762,0.7942,5.4648,0.2897,1.5789,6.1933,0.1872,2.7564,4.1262,3.1218,0.073,5.1042,0.1402,1.2146,0.1598,3.0094,2.4382,4.9159,6.6268,7.9523,7.1678,4.7002,3.8073,5.9332,0.5901,1.7172,0.0023,1.5905,5.73,6.3802,0.9215,1.8091,3.5736,5.0975,0.1197,0.1316,0.0035,1.108,1.8565,2.2895,0.9337,2.339,8.6512,1.7106,3.5758,2.0777,0.6048,2.9542,7.099,3.4272,0.0043,1.5627,1.1468,7.3438,0.0052,3.251,1.1329,5.6082,2.7232,1.6093,7.3498,1.1287,6.1639,5.9958,0.9905,6.5817,3.0966,4.3639,5.0045,1.5403,6.9709,6.1527,1.7643,2.2087,6.0217,6.1251,3.5345,0.0033,0.0024,3.963,1.3404,4.3558,0.638,4.1434,0.8971,6.5907,2.7765,8.3293,1.2777,5.192,4.3741,0.8973,3.0229,6.1925,2.2132,2.3309,4.9328,5.1824,4.4471,2.4922,3.8724,3.3474,7.47,4.533,4.3171,6.3077,4.923,4.7637,5.3495,1.7253,0.812,0.9696,2.4851,2.2489,5.6641,5.0071,5.7281,3.2222,6.5959,6.4746,1.6808,2.6051,2.7752,7.4468,0.4405,2.9344,8.1632,0.0054,5.2662,1.8338,2.3223,0.9942,5.2697,3.2752,0.5976,6.4697,4.4013,1.1759,2.7251,1.7001,1.2083,6.1888,1.6632,2.2177,3.6651,1.811,3.2973,7.8534,3.0381,0.0648,0.1789,2.1703,3.645,0.0196,0.5336,6.512,0.8003,4.2651,3.2584,2.4567,8.2578,2.0912,3.0055,1.8441,3.704,3.0766,0.0246,0.9324,4.2463,3.9657,2.3329,4.6575,4.8323,1.6101,5.2009,8.2788,6.4587,1.9686,0.0106,4.9592,1.905,0.6458,4.4361,0.4889,1.5393,0.5041,1.1982,0.0002,2.183,5.0356,3.4556,2.2955,9.1833,0.7754,3.949,7.1913,10.3312,1.6706,4.4088,5.3405,0.0165,0.0311,2.3392,1.3875,6.0218,6.0569,2.3831,3.0245,1.6425,2.9288,4.2876,6.5226,0.3518,0.0057,1.1079,3.2062,3.0163,1.7798,5.4812,5.6869,0.6905,0.8776,2.4134,0.6085,3.3865,3.0247,7.5653,0.2766,2.1855,0.9493,4.4712,0.0168,1.0578,4.1167,0.7101,0.1365,1.3197,0.6021,6.312,2.0719,0.0007,0.0011,1.9154,1.5958,4.8153,0.4855,3.8111,4.6999,1.4928,0.6836,2.7954,6.154,1.844,2.5946,0.0021,0.0322,0.6115,5.553,7.055,4.2515,1.3603,8.6616,2.2576,0.6506,2.6496,3.5263,2.0866,0.6201,0.0012,0.0007,2.4722,3.7253,2.693,5.0447,0.7376,5.171,1.778,0.3064,2.4581,0.3415,5.8013,0.0095,0.2187,2.1101,3.4375,1.0383,5.9324,1.1519,5.2305,2.1096,3.4101,5.8041,1.5827,1.5655,1.5833,4.8461,3.6458,2.2512,0.7704,3.5537,2.098,6.1249,0.2316,2.021,6.2902,1.2692,6.3489,3.7713,2.6691,2.2095,1.4599,3.752,4.3073,1.9106,3.237,1.0453,5.0879,3.6963,1.7729,3.2663,1.4467,5.2145,9.5803,0.2923,0.6373,6.3134,1.7813,3.0283,2.0034,1.4523,5.3946,6.9899,0.102,1.3405,2.7422,1.3284,4.8571,0.8764,0.8748,2.6166,1.2131,3.5237,3.237,0.6235,7.2332,0.621,4.9675,0.6382,2.575,2.3684,8.1745,1.6132,2.0992,5.4482,1.6067,6.4284,0.1542,1.1935,6.9123,1.3515,2.6536,2.6652,5.7426,4.4757,5.8514,5.9685,7.6522,2.2669,2.289,0.0021,0.3789,5.4415,0.4994,0.0809,0.2236,0.8094,0.7081,4.5658,2.4279,3.9811,4.186,1.6273,0.0956,0.2561,3.0223,5.8572,4.953,0.2332,3.736,3.3082,4.3646,6.5349,2.9337,6.7246,0.6112,4.612,3.6459,1.9709,0.5165,4.1382,8.2054,0.1877,6.1503,2.1941,4.7884,3.4991,1.5605,5.718,1.9919,7.378,2.9001,7.8565,0.5665,1.076,1.6079,4.4998,1.7551,2.9806,4.2302,0.4859,4.4342,0.7369,3.0977,5.4397,2.0577,4.2519,0.5391,8.9074,0.0607,4.2115,2.1237,6.1369,2.1412,0.0,0.9266,5.8238,0.0196,1.8992,1.163,6.2087,1.1518,3.3148,1.4782,1.7322,0.8506,4.9057,2.3672,1.0273,1.8481,0.0338,0.0063,0.0047,0.8281,8.7369,2.2382,6.5833,7.5486,2.8999,8.0193,8.4872,0.7956,0.9185,6.5383,1.2023,1.0671,2.7144,1.6237,1.9232,6.0863,5.2803,1.7756,1.2845,4.9903,5.8971,1.2439,1.1368,7.4281,0.0259,2.2679,0.5358,3.8853,4.2376,0.7204,1.0435,0.0001,1.3548,2.3403,3.5738,1.1979,3.6467,1.5652,2.3812,5.199,4.2767,1.9714,2.4604,0.3288,4.8384,5.0626,0.0485,1.9981,0.764,2.2956,6.9195,4.6063,9.4263,0.5025,5.15,8.6516,0.0042,0.2041,3.9358,3.1498,2.0554,3.5909,1.4617,0.6186,1.8691,0.6751,6.294,1.335,0.0033,3.6545,4.6939,1.8551,4.8611,6.998,2.0907,2.7471,2.8911,1.4352,4.2148,1.5804,0.3825,1.7504,7.4541,0.159,6.7494,2.2733,1.3436,0.6054,5.5306,1.4957,0.0646,5.6328,1.5568,0.9603,0.4167,4.2621,4.2776,7.2828,1.0376,0.9051,0.3638,4.2486,6.3381,3.4425,1.8049,0.1813,2.4777,2.922,0.819,4.6419,3.8443,0.0922,6.0648,4.3605,2.9552,2.0102,7.6909,1.1948,0.4911,8.1336,5.6589,6.5783,1.0104,3.1632,4.0731,4.0935,1.1826,5.9161,0.0068,0.0725,1.0935]}
{"id":2890,"ended":true,"length":617,"text":"War came to the Kitkehahkis on the Republican in 1798. The Omahas, under the leadership of Chief Blackbird, had become perhaps the most powerful group in Nebraska. They were located at present day Pawnee, Nebr. They controlled most of the trading posts in the region. It was the year before the Omahas would be defeated in a battle with the Osages that would ultimately be known as the famous Battle of Sand Creek. The Osages were a smaller group, located to the south along the Missouri River, and had migrated into this region after defeating the Sioux and Cheyennes on the Republican. They were led by one of the great Indian chiefs of the Missouri Valley, Sitting Bull. One man who held great prestige among the Omahas was Big Bone, one of Blackbird's men. The people of the town of New Town, on the Republican, were tired of being cheated by a group of outcasts that they considered to be inferior to themselves. They were led by Colonel Henry Dodge and in 1798 he issued an angry proclamation. He stated that the town of New Town was an occupied town. He declared that any Omaha who entered or remained in the town of New Town and failed to leave within forty-eight hours, would be killed without mercy. Henry Dodge's men were the first Americans to lay eyes on what would become Sioux territory. The Kitkehahki were aware that the Osages were out there, but they were not aware that they and the Omahas were at open war. Dodge decided to begin his war by taking the Omahas' trading posts. The Omahas had at least five trading posts between New Town and the Platte River. Dodge's men burned the posts and the Omahas retaliated by attacking the camps of Dodge's horse soldiers. While the first few skirmishes were relatively minor, the tension escalated quickly. Before long, all five of the Omahas' trading posts were occupied and the Omahas and the Osages were making war. At this point, Big Bone sent out scouts to find out the best position to attack the Americans. They soon found their target. They set up camp not far from Dodge's camp. It was at this time that the first major battle took place. General George Armstrong Custer and his 5,000 men were camping at Fort Kearney. On July 23, 1864, Big Bone sent out a scout and soon reported that a large encampment was not far away. They were not far off. Custer sent General Edward Ord into the forest to find out where the camp was and where the men were located. Ord soon found the camp, but he was wounded before he realized the size of the force that was encamped there. The battle resulted in more than 1200 casualties. When he realized it was too late, Custer ordered Major Sterling Price to make an attack. Two of Custer's scouts were badly wounded and Price was ordered to do this alone. He went in over the brow of the hill and found three of Custer's men already dead. He had his men take the hill over the brow, but the Osage scouts were able to take the hill and surround the Americans. The battle ended when the Indians and soldiers could not agree on terms for a cease fire.","token_len":675,"entropy":[8.0976,1.447,2.5616,11.6922,7.7091,4.3998,4.7345,6.2638,4.8435,3.1743,1.5471,9.6565,8.1338,4.9921,4.0519,1.118,1.8144,10.5888,3.4717,5.813,2.8186,5.7037,0.8204,0.9763,0.0109,5.5007,7.405,5.248,0.4374,2.9747,3.9798,8.962,0.1389,0.563,1.6128,4.0515,0.8096,9.9203,1.0581,2.1127,1.4234,6.5562,2.2212,8.5398,6.2431,5.5715,2.8802,0.0159,1.063,7.7983,0.5652,2.0893,2.4322,4.8827,3.1617,0.1105,0.357,8.8179,2.2747,1.5635,0.5888,3.2333,1.2668,4.2131,0.5019,2.5465,6.078,3.5521,0.8109,3.7087,0.0052,0.011,5.0689,2.0426,1.9593,2.5468,1.4465,1.3895,2.5082,0.3503,6.0754,4.4387,5.0203,1.3449,3.2844,3.3962,3.7554,0.0273,0.1814,8.7031,1.5632,0.0388,8.166,1.5958,0.3107,1.8853,2.808,0.333,1.5643,2.5559,6.7448,1.2486,2.7892,6.1667,5.3262,0.2111,1.3652,5.4084,0.4537,3.7336,0.2212,1.6407,2.0182,2.441,8.3635,2.7792,4.3791,1.6063,3.5954,5.8176,0.3882,5.7083,2.9638,6.3723,0.0864,2.7589,3.2291,0.4734,5.1964,2.2888,2.0989,1.1694,3.425,0.1176,5.2673,0.5915,0.5318,3.6026,5.699,2.9684,1.4027,0.9443,5.796,1.3086,0.734,7.9399,0.0083,0.9963,4.6856,6.603,2.2629,4.7495,3.7182,5.1853,2.9451,0.3441,3.5178,0.0082,0.004,0.4453,7.2513,7.1637,1.5726,3.2967,0.0198,7.207,0.0522,0.0193,4.6043,0.5848,2.6303,6.9488,0.3155,0.9577,5.0573,1.2043,6.4455,7.285,1.7497,3.346,0.2295,4.7677,3.0367,1.1886,7.0127,0.0997,3.0201,5.0824,1.4529,3.1963,2.4375,0.4063,6.8896,1.1815,3.2332,3.5389,2.5704,1.8014,0.0513,3.6175,0.864,3.3441,0.3761,1.5961,1.9432,3.7512,0.2137,4.6902,4.9045,7.54,2.6455,6.0545,2.2598,1.6083,1.3034,6.3312,2.3032,7.5936,1.1113,2.7577,1.8888,3.5411,0.428,1.3127,4.9067,1.9647,0.3255,0.0237,0.9747,4.1261,8.5388,2.9337,1.9848,1.9712,3.9866,0.4529,4.0083,7.6383,4.3637,4.5787,3.9098,3.1107,1.0762,0.9386,0.5392,2.3091,0.1781,0.0093,3.5274,5.1066,0.0694,4.549,3.4701,4.0294,1.1258,1.2055,0.2948,3.3295,0.9272,0.2156,4.2068,6.4993,3.6924,0.4758,7.4903,0.2584,2.9906,3.8943,1.5727,4.3087,1.1757,4.8606,0.394,7.9375,2.6839,0.1896,5.6863,3.3531,0.6861,9.3811,0.7752,0.6641,1.8005,8.1344,0.1009,0.0564,0.0884,5.2065,1.9639,6.1025,1.0558,1.241,3.4281,0.4008,0.7871,5.318,2.791,1.7316,1.5494,1.019,1.3479,1.3856,3.4802,0.7206,1.2748,7.2856,1.1953,3.6084,0.0052,0.0028,0.5732,4.1041,10.3159,0.8885,0.4525,6.0258,4.9454,0.4102,6.1224,2.7643,1.9289,2.5502,3.6643,1.5945,2.7714,0.0064,0.0038,3.8474,7.6993,0.3961,1.7114,1.9372,1.3162,0.0047,0.0068,2.3032,6.2504,2.6487,3.3132,1.6989,0.1042,5.4765,3.5695,0.0971,0.079,1.731,7.7282,0.0859,0.6129,0.6784,2.5695,2.3012,1.2948,7.6856,1.496,6.2077,1.4942,2.893,1.7646,0.0023,0.0019,6.0415,0.0016,0.5037,3.1553,0.643,7.0961,1.7752,5.8075,0.7615,8.3429,5.027,0.598,5.1564,0.9379,6.4105,5.1065,5.1024,0.0507,1.0037,4.4742,2.7613,0.3174,0.6904,7.4112,2.5688,4.0093,0.9153,6.4227,1.1461,0.6964,4.3363,4.5912,1.9956,0.4394,1.1126,0.0062,0.0047,3.9418,1.1279,0.0433,0.5231,2.5498,1.6012,1.2308,2.8551,0.003,0.0022,4.2459,1.1355,1.5257,0.1214,1.2777,5.5899,2.7204,1.4391,4.4765,1.6086,0.2735,0.7874,5.6021,0.0165,4.7138,2.555,3.3804,0.6953,3.6698,1.1861,2.7843,5.6131,3.4491,1.8359,1.76,1.4365,7.3206,0.4195,2.7104,4.2279,0.7376,3.5979,2.5271,0.8325,2.6918,5.2775,0.9656,0.808,7.2885,0.147,0.1124,1.48,0.0216,0.7329,0.7962,3.8369,0.2135,3.1502,0.4486,2.7183,0.2303,1.1782,4.0958,4.6239,0.8658,2.2901,0.0043,0.4052,6.2617,4.3682,5.1728,8.5175,0.5022,2.609,0.9048,6.1657,1.5983,0.1355,0.9352,1.6041,8.4493,1.9382,3.2655,7.1337,0.2305,1.247,3.4604,3.1267,3.4815,0.4183,2.6275,4.9396,0.1425,3.4864,0.022,2.3093,1.8139,1.1648,4.8891,3.4603,6.2124,6.8141,1.2536,3.3029,1.9101,5.0653,0.0017,1.4926,7.5554,0.5224,2.2293,0.5256,2.684,2.0619,3.7304,3.0398,2.483,1.4574,4.1206,0.0039,4.1588,5.5255,5.7531,8.5492,9.5049,0.3604,6.4261,1.0101,2.6721,0.2518,1.4626,0.414,2.317,0.3363,1.7922,1.5954,0.8908,4.6606,0.3785,3.5697,0.0658,0.9303,4.123,1.3432,1.0838,1.048,2.5965,1.5724,2.3133,1.2334,6.3935,5.4816,0.3143,6.8741,1.6021,5.1396,0.0722,0.0932,4.8075,2.5179,0.6151,6.393,0.4762,1.6202,0.0518,2.081,4.1237,6.1448,0.0224,4.6934,1.2141,6.7446,0.2764,0.9186,4.3318,3.5159,4.9798,3.752,0.6351,2.4058,1.3936,0.6258,1.8203,0.001,1.0026,3.3126,8.393,7.5494,0.9289,4.6915,2.2415,2.6689,1.3665,6.0922,1.9258,2.5846,0.0011,0.0017,2.8004,1.1813,4.7812,0.2251,1.0686,2.0052,1.4818,2.7449,0.0691,6.0638,6.0008,4.6676,0.1892,2.7018,4.2771,3.2101,7.214,1.574,13.3607,0.8507,0.6061,4.352,0.9986,2.462,4.6485,2.9558,2.4455,0.0033,0.001,1.0048,4.3959,1.0028,0.4113,2.3134,4.1688,3.9154,1.5124,4.0337,2.1195,5.6476,5.8877,1.099,2.3306,2.5477,1.5937,2.3425,3.302,1.0817,4.9637,1.3418,3.2744,0.0042,2.3311,1.1457,0.9427,1.9125,5.5179,0.6569,5.0254,0.7467,1.9633,2.2459,2.049,3.0691,1.519,6.2153,3.5014,4.3569,5.4019,1.2475,7.183,0.2774,4.727,2.7388,1.8215,6.1202,0.4282,0.3113]}
{"id":1851,"ended":true,"length":602,"text":"On July 15, 1961, to meet the burgeoning educational demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in the City of Boca Raton. The Boca Raton campus, designated as Florida Atlantic University (FAU), opened its doors to 2,000 students on August 16, 1961.\n\nBOCA RATON \u2013 Dr. Larry Marshall, a longtime Florida Atlantic University (FAU) business professor and nationally recognized scholar in the field of entrepreneurship, died Saturday, April 8, 2017, at the age of 88. Marshall, a former business professor of marketing, was an FAU trustee for 12 years and a member of FAU\u2019s Alumni Association Executive Committee.\n\nBOCA RATON \u2013 The University of Central Florida (UCF) announced its intent to move out of its current home at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and into the Boca Raton area.\n\n\"We are very excited and very happy and very excited to have a campus there,\" said UCF Chancellor Frank Brogan. \"Just as we've brought our business school to Orlando and our health care school to West Palm Beach, this brings us to the next level and it\u2019s really quite exciting.\"\n\nOn April 12, UCF submitted a notice to the Florida Board of Governors of its intent to make a purchase and sale agreement with FAU for its existing facility at FAU West Campus. This step marks the next step in the process of UCF\u2019s move from Orlando to Boca Raton.\n\n\"It was important to submit the document so the state board had a record of the intent to do something,\" Brogan said.\n\nAt the conclusion of the meeting, FAU President John Kelly thanked the board members for their support throughout this process. \u201cWe appreciate your openness and your willingness to support us as we work through the details of what\u2019s best for our university,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s in the best interest of the university. We will continue to work with the university as we move forward.\u201d\n\nIn the next phase of the process, a request will be made to the Florida Board of Governors to authorize a request for proposal for the new site and for a request for proposals for construction of an administrative headquarters. This step will be followed by a request for proposal process, and a contract could be signed by the university by the end of the summer.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University, dedicated to the greater good of Florida, is a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities. With more than 18,000 students, FAU's campus in Boca Raton and fields of study in downtown Miami, Palm Beach County and Orlando, the University offers 300 degree programs in more than 200 academic subjects. The University's faculty are recognized internationally for their academic excellence.

{"id":3892,"ended":true,"length":574,"text":"Reproduction starts in November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest ; the estrous cycle runs approximately 22 days, while estrus lasts only a day or less. The mating season in the wild is marked by a temporary increase of female activity in the breeding forest -- an increase that usually coincides with the arrival of the males. Once these males arrive in force, the number of female visitors drops steadily until the end of the season. Although this male-dependent fluctuation suggests that the estrous cycle is seasonal, much more is known about the timing of this seasonal phase in captive populations and has yielded a clear and robust identification of estrus.\n\nReproduction in two captive populations of Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Varecia coquerelitissima) has been marked to a great extent by the presence of estrus - i.e., a dramatic increase in adult female body weight during the preceding period. This has also provided an estimation of the reproductive span of the captive animals and of the reproductive cycle in captivity. However, the reproductive cycle in the wild has also been characterized and we have therefore obtained a measure of the seasonal amplitude, or variability of the estrous cycle. We compared the findings of captive and wild populations, and, as a basis for future research, presented here the first estrus detection for wild V. coquerelitissima in their natural home at Kirindy Forest. Our results confirm that estrus is a major variable that appears both in captive and wild populations. This research project was carried out in collaboration with the Centre for Bio-Ethnological Research at the University of Antananarivo (CEN) in Madagascar.\n\nAbstract [en]\n\nFemale Reproductive Function of Giant Mouse Lemurs (Varecia coquerelitissima) in Madagascar\n\nN\u00e4gell M, Fick S, Jahn K.\n\nWild giant mouse lemurs (Varecia coquerelitissima) are monogamous and breed throughout the year, which is thought to allow for maintenance and population growth. In contrast, their captive relatives breed only once a year, in the autumn. In addition, they exhibit a cyclical response to changes in climatic conditions, with a seasonal female population rise preceding the arrival of new males and vice versa. Thus, the reproductive cycle is seasonal. One female can mate with several males during a season and the length of a female estrous cycle is highly variable between populations [1].\n\nTo investigate any possible differences between captive and in the wild populations, we observed the body weight of 30 female lemurs. With this approach, we have been able to establish the presence of different reproductive phases in various populations. We also observed that the wild animals show a greater variation in the lengths of their estrous cycle than the captive individuals. We conclude that the estrous cycle of wild giant mouse lemurs is seasonal, with a maximum length of ~28 days and a frequency of estrus of about 2% of all days in an estrous cycle in wild females.\n\nThe results also suggest an age-related component in the reproductive function, as the length of the estrous phase increases with the age of females and the number of female visitors to the mating area decreases.","token_len":677,"entropy":[10.1952,0.8446,7.963,2.2563,4.4858,5.2882,9.9758,5.0449,5.508,0.3083,3.4406,9.4393,7.0064,8.9819,0.5935,5.4561,9.5549,6.8789,4.9546,7.4065,9.9521,2.2599,8.6686,5.675,4.0307,4.1589,7.5298,5.811,1.0438,2.0459,3.486,5.3651,2.5345,2.7665,2.9169,2.7813,3.1304,2.601,5.2265,0.331,2.1492,5.7374,1.2151,4.5497,1.6895,3.278,1.0385,5.5685,0.2575,2.0781,8.2703,4.4239,2.578,4.3763,5.1772,2.4494,1.2251,3.3475,6.8246,7.3089,4.1376,2.3495,1.4333,4.8283,3.3351,0.0144,1.0137,3.3902,0.0254,1.7492,4.1979,0.6305,5.8313,4.6657,1.8665,2.5435,1.4095,11.0523,0.3175,1.3032,5.6661,0.0444,2.6179,6.9175,3.1752,4.2369,2.2538,1.3052,3.5138,0.0228,0.4632,3.139,0.6329,5.0731,3.1142,5.8618,3.2277,5.8579,7.2765,0.0149,7.447,0.6645,1.4251,2.9343,0.6102,0.1868,1.1063,6.7262,0.4232,6.3185,2.7626,2.2028,0.2232,0.2652,0.5783,3.6352,0.5909,1.9671,3.4708,4.6461,2.2523,6.9276,2.554,3.6679,6.5336,6.4278,2.9545,5.7766,2.6266,4.7918,6.2541,0.3606,3.1333,0.5939,2.4459,1.6443,0.0031,6.9514,0.0003,0.1678,2.3922,6.2119,4.9666,1.068,1.5261,2.1579,0.0195,0.0089,0.0028,0.5654,0.4064,0.6774,0.2186,0.0413,1.7772,5.4856,6.9961,9.1924,7.0174,1.3548,0.0807,9.4105,7.9836,0.4799,0.4251,3.1987,0.7766,6.2087,6.69,3.3886,3.1229,0.2399,0.4025,1.9106,2.4179,0.0178,3.0611,0.3067,6.5281,7.0592,0.0043,0.001,0.0984,2.0627,5.5235,0.9457,0.1098,5.6815,2.7775,6.1984,1.2966,2.6377,0.5566,5.4122,4.9023,0.8292,2.507,4.1384,4.2315,4.7682,2.3687,8.1265,0.0613,0.4889,3.4295,6.8067,0.3215,0.9504,3.1802,5.3802,2.8305,3.0974,0.6828,2.8912,2.9286,1.8487,4.3203,0.4189,3.3942,0.0099,1.7865,3.3445,1.7894,1.2391,1.8463,1.1059,1.8037,3.7034,0.3848,2.1299,5.5819,5.9892,1.3296,4.7097,5.1201,1.1665,5.0776,0.0626,0.9467,7.152,6.6476,4.5057,3.4984,4.3724,1.8493,0.9008,1.4033,0.6697,0.1401,1.2326,2.5056,5.4555,0.7673,6.8724,0.6591,6.9158,1.3609,1.1177,1.2559,3.3773,1.7275,4.6194,2.8531,1.2468,5.9802,0.5874,2.8696,2.0037,0.2301,5.1188,5.4127,1.5136,4.4426,8.224,0.3662,5.15,4.8616,6.3852,6.1308,4.0343,0.589,0.0195,0.0012,0.0754,0.0616,0.0092,2.0764,6.5419,4.2479,5.0201,4.2402,1.4893,0.0034,0.0016,0.2067,0.6427,3.3267,0.9155,3.4965,0.9357,1.6362,0.0203,1.1569,1.5634,1.878,4.9262,3.5243,5.3597,5.8037,0.7864,1.2224,0.6698,0.0648,0.2725,1.1099,3.4729,5.8532,6.0781,2.3517,3.4082,0.0018,1.3239,1.0558,0.0156,0.8763,4.341,0.2884,5.0003,2.4474,3.4295,2.6039,2.8679,0.4756,1.391,0.5733,0.7491,0.0224,6.5333,4.7125,0.0295,0.0033,2.33,3.3785,6.5588,2.3401,1.1602,8.5081,0.8358,0.6189,0.0002,5.7114,4.8316,9.4574,0.29,0.4393,0.0002,6.8162,7.2787,1.2551,4.6662,1.4128,3.0106,0.3306,5.3379,0.4723,2.5583,0.5368,0.1364,0.0116,0.2822,0.0074,0.0015,0.0241,0.0087,0.0065,0.1166,1.2819,3.7785,1.2199,0.0002,5.2328,10.632,6.5793,5.0146,6.638,3.2272,5.0341,6.9155,3.7364,0.3607,4.9456,4.5274,3.6882,2.47,2.0254,0.0002,6.7531,8.5536,0.8081,0.4821,0.9828,0.011,1.0141,0.7693,0.0625,0.019,0.2503,0.0099,0.0026,0.0226,0.0113,0.008,0.1051,1.5282,6.4928,0.0146,1.5257,5.6524,5.817,0.521,0.7636,1.8134,4.5787,1.4728,5.1018,0.0234,6.3583,1.4554,7.4148,2.791,5.43,1.6346,0.7725,2.9082,3.1244,0.2716,3.1319,6.5819,4.6015,5.3268,2.8592,1.8146,0.9633,0.086,1.304,2.9176,1.4475,2.448,1.4863,2.4546,3.2154,0.21,2.5877,3.7705,1.7251,7.957,0.2383,6.7223,0.3953,3.6917,0.0637,4.8972,0.0187,0.1702,1.2793,2.6832,2.5863,5.1106,6.6248,3.6565,5.9269,7.8734,0.932,3.0945,0.0143,4.7996,0.82,2.5919,8.4284,0.0428,0.2865,4.5966,0.0787,1.6628,2.5673,1.1106,2.6576,5.3275,1.9006,6.3806,6.2499,4.2318,3.4915,2.6927,3.8135,0.4663,2.7323,2.1733,3.4128,2.1908,2.4753,6.0764,0.07,2.9352,3.7802,8.2785,1.1319,0.0162,1.2019,5.6747,0.4143,3.3951,4.2728,5.049,1.1965,0.4852,2.5282,0.0002,5.0497,2.2647,8.262,2.6382,4.1372,1.2768,0.6233,0.309,9.9728,2.921,0.0111,1.3432,2.3736,0.3559,4.832,1.9245,7.505,0.6464,0.6809,7.7898,2.7184,3.6322,0.0741,0.0113,4.1822,6.2828,3.3338,5.3659,0.2208,0.4266,3.3088,3.6845,0.0129,0.0045,4.0038,1.4304,4.4876,0.1637,5.3759,2.0068,2.6785,1.0085,5.962,1.0899,1.6027,2.1526,2.3794,2.5849,1.171,1.2807,6.9772,6.1104,3.8623,1.2957,4.8991,3.5651,0.1904,2.5267,5.4083,0.2026,1.1406,1.6898,0.0452,2.3312,1.2334,1.7943,0.2309,5.7552,0.4934,2.5189,3.4951,0.0662,1.2024,2.5984,0.3553,0.1679,2.6958,2.7376,1.4917,1.4023,0.0155,0.0586,0.002,0.8638,2.7552,1.2079,2.0584,1.1825,4.04,3.1182,0.2643,5.6941,4.5049,0.2754,2.3941,0.6162,6.8793,0.2615,5.0498,0.2283,2.3081,3.4799,2.7133,1.9096,3.3842,3.6119,6.165,2.331,4.8812,1.2073,0.3471,0.341,3.1514,3.4136,6.1898,0.6412,1.2911,0.0001,2.3518,4.2738,5.569,2.0916,4.1813,4.5056,0.4768,2.1881,6.9463,2.1096,0.6044,1.1429,3.9563,5.0527,2.6162,2.4885,3.7843,0.0862,0.6396,0.7994,0.0241,6.578,2.116,1.6579,1.0102,3.3701,0.1786,3.895,2.3483,1.5274,1.9719,0.0252,3.2102,1.3283,5.1148,0.3863,5.6557,2.7767,1.6139,1.009]}
{"id":4321,"ended":true,"length":598,"text":"There is little information available concerning the lifespan of wild black mambas, but the longest surviving captive example had a recorded lifespan of 11 years. It is possible that wild snakes may live up to 17 years in the wild, but they have shorter life spans in captivity.\n\nIn general, black mambas are a slow growing species. They grow much slower than their cousin species the kob ( Kobus africanus ). Their average body length ranges from 24 cm ( 9.5 inches ) for females to 30 cm, ( 12 inches ) for males. The largest recorded mamba weighed 4.9 kilograms ( 12.8 pounds ).\n\nBehavior\n\nFemale mambas give birth to up to five clutches during the year. Clutch sizes range from 11 to 17 eggs. The first clutch is laid after mating has occurred and the last after the snake has given birth to a surviving litter.\n\nLike all mambas, newborn black mambas are blind. The first shed takes place within a month of birth. The mamba then rapidly sheds its skin several times during the year. The first shed is small and light blue in color. The second and third and sheds are much larger. At this age the snake becomes quite noisy.\n\nSocial Structure\n\nA black mamba will live most of its life alone or in small family groups. Usually only three individuals will live in a group although this increases to four if one more female joins the group. All members of a family unit are related and this could be for many generations. Family units typically occupy a single location for the rest of their lives. When forced to move a female will often abandon her offspring.\n\nDiet and Reproduction\n\nA typical mamba diet consists of small vertebrates. They have even been seen eating mice and lizards. Small prey is usually consumed whole, but sometimes it is cut into pieces and put into the snake\u2019s mouth.\n\nBlack mambas feed mostly on the ground, but they will also come up to eat small animals and reptiles. They will also venture into water, but only if there are no obstacles. The mamba\u2019s breeding habits are similar to other mambas. All members of the family unit will gather at the female\u2019s den. After mating takes place the female sheds her skin and the female and mate will engage in a form of cuddle puddle. The male will deposit his sperm into the female\u2019s belly. The female will remain with her mate for several weeks. The offspring will then be born via a cloaca. The young will not be fed or handled and they will remain hidden for the first few months.\n\nReproduction\n\nBlack mambas mate once a year and are oviparous (egg producing). Although the mating season starts late the snakes will mate in late August \/ early October. They mate singly. The male\u2019s sperm is stored in the female\u2019s reproductive organs.

{"id":3937,"ended":true,"length":610,"text":"The college first admitted women in 1870, although at that time there were no female residence halls. The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous stagecoach trek from Philadelphia. Women became faculty members between 1879 and 1883, and three of them were granted tenure : Clara D. Brown, Elma C. Brown, and Lizzie Green.\n\nIn 1887, four additional female faculty members were hired : Laura M. Stott Elrod, Emma M. Stoltzfus, Susie H. White, and M. M. Jones. That same year, the first female resident assistant was hired: Jennie Allen. Jennie also held the title of assistant to the dean from 1888 until 1895, when she won a faculty position in the home work department. She remained there until her retirement from the university in 1913.\n\nAlthough women were given their first residence halls in 1888, they were not allowed to use the dormitories unless they were registered for tuition and in classes. As a result, residence halls were exclusively available to male students until 1894, when they were opened to all undergraduates.\n\nWomen had first applied for housing in 1873, but the university\u2019s housing committee took several years to complete its report on housing. It reported in the September 1874 issue of the student newspaper that \u201c[t]he question of securing lodging for unmarried students is not at all to be favored in its inception. We therefore advise that no such policy be adopted.\u201d The housing committee also explained its conclusion: \u201cIt does not appear to us at present that the admission of unmarried women into a university would be consistent with the best interests of the institution.\u201d\n\nIn 1871, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation granting women access to some of the rights and privileges of men. The first act, Act No. 2, established the Women\u2019s Polytechnic Institute, also known as the Philadelphia College of Industrial Labor. The act also gave women access to a higher education program, along with the right to hold office, to possess their own property, and to contract. They also got the right to vote as of 1881.\n\nWomen continued to push for additional rights through the 1890s. However, Pennsylvania was one of only 16 states that did not grant women the right to exercise citizenship on equal terms. However, in 1896, at the start of a national movement to enfranchise women, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Act No. 5, granting all those born in the state of Pennsylvania the right to vote.\n\nWhile Pennsylvania women were able to vote for the first time in 1896, they were not able to enjoy all of the privileges offered to men until the Pennsylvania Legislature passed an amendment to the state constitution in 1919. The amendment granted women the right to the same benefits as men, which included the right to participate in university-sponsored organizations through the formation of women\u2019s auxiliary clubs and societies.\n\nIn 1910, the state of Pennsylvania recognized women\u2019s equality within the public sphere by removing the word \u201cmale\u201d from the state constitution (Article III, Section 31). This change gave women the same rights and privileges as men\u2014rights which helped to open the door to their entry into the field of higher education.","token_len":678,"entropy":[8.9936,7.6415,5.4639,3.7534,1.3062,8.037,0.91,5.6658,5.1572,1.3529,0.113,2.4322,0.2971,2.3,3.7208,9.179,0.15,0.7605,2.0572,7.4199,1.5384,1.0258,4.3619,12.4499,5.9491,7.4967,7.6796,3.5097,4.8533,2.8951,4.0425,0.0014,9.4663,7.8185,0.0037,1.8703,2.5943,5.1967,3.4929,3.4614,5.1723,5.4647,0.7184,6.4798,1.1678,3.8351,0.0765,1.0331,1.947,0.8791,1.3089,6.6424,1.6643,1.4638,1.6966,7.0764,1.1998,8.9821,6.8176,4.9625,1.2124,4.7034,0.6437,5.1807,4.9697,3.589,0.2108,3.9899,0.4308,0.1336,4.8447,3.1696,0.016,6.0101,0.5193,1.7954,0.0128,2.4163,0.8469,2.4024,0.4172,5.5506,5.5791,2.6694,0.8003,0.0855,1.3375,2.6455,6.0087,6.2162,2.9367,0.0984,5.4928,4.6466,9.923,4.3404,0.5734,5.6334,2.7058,0.0133,1.8479,6.4431,0.0884,8.2288,0.9297,0.4705,8.2502,0.877,3.642,0.1413,4.3221,0.2593,0.6238,5.2431,1.1653,3.8966,0.1479,6.0826,0.697,6.2717,1.4492,0.0097,0.2344,1.8349,2.4633,1.7231,5.3974,6.4867,2.4165,0.9197,4.0168,6.8466,0.1945,7.1332,1.2565,5.0658,0.0139,4.9503,4.6185,1.2016,2.3444,0.1482,2.4453,2.4041,1.4691,1.9339,4.8005,3.4513,1.1013,4.0274,1.0792,0.2523,0.3991,6.2588,1.7058,4.4773,1.3805,1.8387,1.4786,6.1357,7.1442,1.4486,0.5689,3.2425,4.0821,1.895,0.3793,2.5168,1.5882,2.0162,0.5696,3.6806,0.4831,4.7449,0.3502,0.6504,0.0003,4.694,2.2019,1.8429,4.7719,5.0084,1.7558,3.6374,0.3165,1.1779,3.9882,0.226,1.9483,1.1427,1.1518,1.7361,0.2269,3.1252,1.7486,4.5766,2.252,0.0,5.0178,0.552,1.1137,4.8564,3.0586,5.3723,2.5819,6.1685,7.78,1.5303,4.1486,1.1149,0.1846,0.0977,5.122,0.0474,0.7244,7.1609,4.1333,0.5592,2.9299,0.6442,4.8879,2.5728,1.6888,0.9823,0.1691,2.7403,0.5468,3.4448,0.9314,2.7121,4.0572,0.0012,0.6158,1.4213,0.0002,2.8331,3.8557,5.7173,5.001,0.5626,3.764,0.9438,1.2201,4.1404,0.8387,1.7893,2.2216,3.5583,18.4934,9.0505,1.5459,4.0781,4.4294,5.5401,4.9041,0.8531,0.063,4.666,2.0934,5.0696,1.8413,2.9771,1.5577,3.2644,4.998,2.587,4.4093,5.0756,1.145,1.5391,0.4463,0.5147,0.874,6.1641,0.5137,0.9876,8.6133,5.6656,5.8577,3.338,0.0333,0.2663,8.036,0.6727,8.0993,6.1074,0.9041,5.7691,2.8264,3.4095,2.8888,4.4402,0.4934,5.8837,0.0749,8.4771,2.9879,4.6451,6.1232,0.7471,5.2359,3.8902,5.9801,1.002,3.8081,2.8218,4.2718,1.5956,0.9393,1.9061,4.7941,6.7312,2.6667,3.6574,0.1283,3.1982,6.4765,3.8318,5.6835,2.3625,2.1259,1.8994,6.4066,4.8296,0.0596,2.4725,1.6636,1.1196,5.6927,0.8922,0.3684,1.5406,6.182,0.4845,1.7503,1.1587,2.0247,3.0659,3.4697,4.4667,1.319,5.5113,0.0086,0.4949,5.0169,0.497,0.017,0.5159,2.5989,1.667,2.2453,1.3966,1.3755,0.0002,2.2558,1.3982,4.6558,0.1157,1.0629,5.6156,4.3097,0.4086,1.2493,2.705,3.5989,2.2951,4.4022,0.0325,5.5644,1.0058,0.2684,8.0338,1.7719,0.4606,0.8526,2.0161,0.9024,1.4059,3.9554,5.0594,2.1767,5.3171,2.4433,0.0118,4.0704,0.4775,5.3245,1.1108,4.0041,9.2372,0.9694,0.1525,10.683,0.3465,0.0066,2.3714,1.3867,5.6492,0.0805,0.0292,0.4551,4.6063,3.8054,0.6066,7.231,4.4436,1.0787,1.1941,3.1318,2.1916,3.6575,0.9593,2.8201,0.0187,2.6427,5.4265,0.6511,3.3803,1.6994,6.2791,0.0174,1.8948,2.0133,0.0791,5.1652,3.6577,1.9712,3.1705,6.954,5.4463,0.3363,1.5519,0.4886,0.4012,0.2939,7.6294,3.9533,6.4287,0.9745,4.7664,1.7088,0.1529,0.0391,1.3935,4.1308,6.5277,1.7443,3.1801,0.4814,0.8052,0.0002,2.6861,4.0545,0.0853,8.2364,0.5066,6.564,2.0599,4.4165,1.4435,5.5459,0.2644,1.0928,5.0351,0.0067,5.473,2.5437,3.4586,0.0195,0.7442,5.2897,0.0628,1.2589,1.9498,0.0322,3.0506,1.045,1.2968,0.1699,0.0549,7.883,7.2124,4.2743,5.2229,0.3534,1.0931,4.6162,0.0056,2.3991,3.1356,0.306,5.6649,0.3527,4.0306,0.0012,2.456,3.3025,3.291,0.8508,7.2163,4.2038,0.0001,0.0145,0.6473,0.6341,1.1763,1.5371,3.1036,0.0389,0.926,4.6197,0.2675,0.0052,2.6819,0.797,3.4141,3.7398,6.2803,5.7971,1.3873,1.9226,1.0737,2.5083,0.1028,1.0257,0.1937,0.0626,0.4756,0.6718,1.4069,0.0002,4.7667,2.7453,4.1739,1.5491,2.0544,0.0126,1.3292,3.014,1.9796,0.6404,0.0209,0.563,2.1189,0.1693,1.6595,0.9224,1.026,0.9279,0.0222,7.0417,3.4834,1.3482,0.3767,2.17,5.594,0.7803,0.711,4.3496,1.7218,5.7153,2.5958,1.6755,3.5684,1.6958,1.4122,0.5964,1.7971,0.2508,1.396,5.5002,0.9561,1.3206,1.1466,3.1509,0.7337,0.5202,0.1227,0.0447,5.0106,2.6698,4.3183,0.5896,0.1408,0.9814,3.9049,1.4629,1.0493,0.1044,0.0447,4.7941,0.0841,5.0096,3.9555,0.5468,4.6261,6.6861,1.5191,6.6693,0.043,4.1103,10.6197,0.5203,0.0624,6.4137,5.2896,1.4082,7.664,0.6627,0.9469,0.0002,1.9037,4.4076,0.0817,1.0656,3.1698,3.1496,0.3188,5.3967,2.0702,6.1242,0.107,0.0064,7.1496,4.735,0.6113,4.9404,2.3551,2.4776,6.3385,0.9437,6.0641,3.5202,1.9069,6.9837,0.3511,7.5628,0.4584,0.5038,2.2026,0.8431,6.098,4.7032,3.4476,0.4149,0.3731,6.6905,0.8649,2.5353,2.7529,3.7898,0.3663,0.5709,3.701,0.6952,2.2503,0.317,0.3794,0.0568,4.9162,5.3757,2.6828,8.2397,1.3312,4.3002,0.7201,1.2938,0.3126,4.9979,5.3135,0.1089,0.8804,5.0612,0.2587,3.8685,0.0425,0.3514]}
{"id":4489,"ended":true,"length":648,"text":"Ste Pickford developed the gameplay map for Ironsword. According to him, he basically copied the map that was used in a conversion port of Ghosts'n Goblins that he developed a couple of years back, and then he turned it into a board game so that people would actually play the game.\n\nThe final board is about 23\" wide by 28\" long, which is an improvement over the earlier games (i.e. \"The Legend of Zelda Game\" ). The board has a 1\" grid system, and there are six \"moves\", each of which is one-sixth of the turn. In play, you roll for attack, defense, and move. For each number of dice you roll on turn, the GM rolls for movement and rolls and adds defense bonuses to the target to determine your turn rate. The GM does not move on their turn (just like an RPG character does not move during their turn).\n\nYou also get a choice of four weapons, which determine your \"special attack\", or dice roll. The \"Giant Bomb\", which is a bomb placed on the floor, that can kill a monster in a single explosion, or wipe out an entire group of monsters and set it on fire. (Of course, you still have to roll to determine exactly which monster dies. ). The \"Harpoon\", where you hold up the flail and fire it into a group of enemies at once, giving the ability to kill any one of them. The \"Hammer\" is your standard weapon set, and does less damage, but is more common in battle. Lastly, there is the \"Flail\", which is a weapon that lets you deal a lot of damage at once to a large number of enemies. The monsters each have an Armor Class, which determines how much damage you do, and then there is a dice roll to determine which individual damage number you hit. If all monsters are hit by each individual attack, they each lose 5 HP (on a 6 of course).\n\nIn addition to picking a character to pilot your ship along the path and fight with, players also choose their weapons, and get their pilot skills. Each character gets 3 skill points as they gain levels, and they can spend any two to upgrade one of the standard pilot skills (the skill that lets you move and attack and things like that). Their pilot skills get better as they gain levels, with each one getting at least 6 different levels, including four skills that are specific to a character. These skills are useful when you fight against enemies, especially since in a game of Ironsword you will probably get surrounded at some point, and need to turn or move and shoot, making every little bit of a pilot skill that much better.\n\nSte Pickford will be releasing his completed game to the public in three \"books\", with the first going to backers of the Kickstarter, which runs from July 9th to 26th. Those who do not get the game during that timeframe will get the second and third \"books\" later, for backers who want them. If there are still some left over, the extra copies will be sold to the general public later (or possibly used for a future project).\n\nIronsword gamebooks and the campaign for them are available now from Ironsword.com or Kickstarter.com.","token_len":678,"entropy":[11.4292,2.6734,10.5727,1.7303,9.1488,6.83,1.826,8.7709,3.7865,10.7946,1.7302,6.6152,0.0009,3.1241,0.139,3.0764,7.5077,4.8387,0.9136,4.1061,4.6257,1.8945,1.7654,1.123,4.9504,9.8802,9.6739,0.8089,9.3769,4.5308,10.6932,3.5926,0.0416,5.0599,2.1818,3.4881,4.4021,2.8634,1.0304,0.0979,1.4926,1.9079,1.0776,3.2049,3.767,3.9983,0.6994,0.2084,0.697,6.6721,0.1274,5.9588,1.1251,2.7013,2.5987,3.3821,0.5437,1.9822,0.201,0.9477,1.0198,0.0011,2.6788,5.4815,5.6127,3.7987,5.3472,6.8983,3.0416,2.497,1.9819,4.0083,0.4087,0.9299,0.8008,3.1847,0.8034,4.5614,4.6152,0.5543,0.6303,5.8024,4.6785,4.2937,5.2668,0.0411,0.0002,0.4508,4.8279,3.0551,4.9448,0.0493,1.1222,6.6985,2.4695,6.473,1.4835,2.2273,2.4132,1.1784,5.4123,1.8752,4.1976,6.2737,1.447,1.7873,2.9513,0.6732,4.0329,4.1472,5.9337,1.5489,2.4116,1.9487,1.406,0.0171,1.8594,4.7665,2.9951,5.4222,0.578,0.7222,0.9892,5.7921,1.5575,3.5755,6.6092,0.4595,1.8542,5.3922,4.2758,6.0542,0.9181,1.4767,0.1054,1.5326,3.9022,1.6121,4.6398,1.8456,6.605,1.3097,5.2088,1.8033,0.5085,4.0562,5.4255,2.4856,2.3199,6.076,3.0455,2.8655,4.497,1.8895,4.2194,7.0273,4.0669,8.1105,6.2957,1.7652,1.6072,5.9512,4.6117,3.1778,3.8974,3.4165,5.2497,0.2648,1.9713,1.83,3.9183,0.7339,4.9062,3.4188,3.8171,0.1536,3.6089,5.4328,3.1397,4.3126,4.2601,5.0204,1.4622,2.7273,0.5102,3.0195,3.0819,0.2871,0.7995,1.235,0.0002,3.9001,3.558,1.5869,1.5917,5.4215,0.1907,3.3915,4.3722,1.6558,1.6874,5.1225,1.2948,4.8725,5.5457,1.7081,1.7707,3.8091,7.2023,3.3557,1.6137,1.8031,3.1959,7.2053,2.8266,3.4853,2.5511,1.9129,1.2816,1.392,4.3363,4.8503,0.7455,0.9928,3.4755,1.2321,5.3645,2.1488,3.4721,2.0122,2.6112,2.8916,1.792,0.9256,7.6629,0.767,2.767,11.2169,0.126,2.6622,0.2718,3.3034,0.3941,1.4876,3.865,6.46,4.0211,0.8251,0.0369,0.9528,5.1667,5.7855,0.049,0.2475,1.9734,4.1265,1.3212,0.2875,2.4646,2.2088,4.3293,6.573,1.8403,1.6482,4.402,3.2549,8.3997,1.5673,0.8544,4.4933,3.812,2.7593,1.8069,5.6277,1.0144,5.5066,2.9359,1.9547,5.8754,1.7381,1.6494,2.9483,1.1734,3.3521,1.7276,3.9164,0.134,1.6436,4.5253,1.3458,0.4947,5.6803,2.5395,5.4204,0.022,3.9596,3.2455,3.2893,0.7916,0.5721,1.1423,1.6828,0.4073,5.828,0.1499,1.7665,1.8195,4.4503,4.8717,2.1016,7.1619,0.8409,1.6633,5.0237,6.3354,0.1007,2.0128,0.4421,2.6612,1.855,5.4338,1.7785,5.3797,0.6535,6.2415,0.0804,2.3834,0.9813,1.3928,0.3186,4.8435,2.1097,0.4848,0.4654,1.4444,0.7457,3.4679,0.8229,4.3989,0.1197,5.6543,3.1127,2.3522,0.0641,0.1408,4.3988,0.4235,4.1123,1.9049,2.9669,1.9607,0.0164,0.3808,0.7715,2.2302,7.6675,7.5917,0.7435,3.8373,7.0786,0.8531,2.8945,0.994,1.0079,0.7884,1.2881,0.3657,2.0473,1.8021,2.7605,0.7232,4.8337,4.2245,0.9257,1.3826,5.1401,0.2891,2.5395,0.2807,2.3556,6.268,4.2241,5.3709,1.5987,2.6057,0.5909,3.7408,3.6664,5.3153,1.6812,1.7567,1.8545,4.494,4.6491,2.0308,0.271,2.4864,3.8562,1.9346,4.293,2.4816,2.9625,5.8481,2.2974,3.3412,6.2324,4.6884,0.855,1.1415,0.0002,3.2465,2.1666,0.4416,7.8168,2.8118,3.7156,2.4922,5.757,1.7036,1.0416,7.5159,1.3755,5.4862,4.4064,5.4978,2.4216,0.3208,3.5642,1.3805,3.9219,2.696,4.2343,2.0287,2.1925,4.8197,3.1505,5.6913,2.5367,1.1953,2.9504,1.5203,2.9253,4.0806,4.3742,0.0952,4.6938,2.5044,4.1389,1.8683,1.0566,0.9225,2.8123,1.6209,3.4861,3.2371,6.0214,3.1819,4.7141,3.7145,0.9828,1.7839,7.6106,4.5525,0.3056,2.4586,3.5449,5.4382,2.4733,3.9905,0.4106,4.3136,2.7263,1.293,3.9073,8.4222,0.2558,0.0631,0.5036,6.6373,0.9306,0.8147,4.216,4.0891,1.2236,0.5473,1.6765,1.2127,0.5815,4.2032,2.1471,3.7695,1.5762,5.2449,0.0708,3.7302,4.3531,3.1261,1.9028,4.7574,5.867,4.2629,1.3364,2.047,5.066,0.1231,2.367,3.3598,0.796,4.1387,1.2909,1.1851,5.7503,2.5061,0.9448,6.8268,3.2943,3.0817,1.2657,4.3748,5.3101,5.2422,2.2726,2.2244,1.9709,6.1322,0.0013,0.0514,1.5877,3.158,3.2029,3.43,9.0544,4.8331,3.0793,0.0534,1.4815,1.1011,4.8379,0.2855,5.7774,5.9297,3.527,3.6766,4.3725,4.4841,4.6152,6.2191,5.4246,0.993,0.1536,4.3559,4.3789,0.8022,3.6803,6.7185,2.8854,0.4408,0.5808,0.0002,7.8553,1.7703,0.0012,5.9673,1.6359,2.1505,2.9,7.5799,1.7417,4.3204,0.9373,0.4862,1.9511,5.8486,6.0812,7.6329,1.5753,3.5503,2.1962,0.5994,4.7506,1.6924,4.5669,2.4375,1.307,2.0213,2.0774,3.0941,5.9343,1.3569,2.7004,3.7664,0.2637,0.7747,5.2537,0.0064,1.0213,5.0894,1.0874,5.0384,0.3906,3.082,0.6527,2.8216,5.492,1.3202,3.4039,0.4604,1.5173,1.7716,2.8819,4.0095,0.5049,3.523,0.6684,0.7467,4.3099,2.57,4.5779,2.7029,0.9531,2.4731,3.1746,2.2019,3.972,4.4659,0.9283,3.2871,3.6446,4.642,0.5284,1.1568,2.3379,6.9619,2.9997,0.6452,0.6419,3.3647,2.3173,1.7113,1.7243,0.0291,5.8924,4.9042,3.6171,5.7557,5.4263,1.3626,3.0689,2.7031,3.2403,0.998,0.636,0.0002,3.9929,3.6359,0.0319,5.9687,8.0422,3.9084,2.2773,4.0836,3.677,4.8599,1.3997,1.1384,2.2114,3.1173,1.7715,0.0033,0.037,1.1057,0.5496,4.8609,3.7581,0.5353,1.6103,0.619]}
{"id":14,"ended":true,"length":586,"text":"After the first five games, all losses, Jeff Carter suffered a broken foot that kept him out of the line @ - @ up for 10 games. While Carter was injured, the Blue Jackets became the hottest team in the NHL, winning a season high six games in a row to vault @ + 4 on the season.\n\nReturning Carter to the line-up on March 21st, the Blue Jackets went 5-2-4 in the remaining 12 games to finish the season at 33-40-10, good for 63 points, good enough for 9th place in the East. At that time, Columbus was 3 games out of a playoff spot.\n\nAs the regular season draws to a close, the Blue Jackets have had a strong final stretch. In the last 11 games, Columbus is 8-3-2 to finish at 50 points, good for sixth place in the Metro Division. At that time the Washington Capitals, also @ 50 points in eighth place in the Metro and had won 5 in a row to get to 49 points. Columbus, who lost their first game after the return of Carter, have 5 in a row, beating the Capitals tonight for only their second road win and to move into seventh place and on equal points with Washington\n\nSo what has made Columbus click? At first the Jackets looked like a team who was just playing better than they had all year. But in reality it\u2019s not that at all. Columbus has been out-playing both their opponents and they have come up with clutch stops when they needed them.\n\nThe most remarkable trend that the Penguins have had to deal with that could not be predicted was a defensive shift by the Blue Jackets.\n\nFor the first four months of the season, the Penguins conceded the most goals in the League at 3 goals\/ game. The Blue Jackets have completely neutralized Pittsburgh\u2019s defense, scoring 4.13 goals per game against them, allowing only 2.88 goals per game.\n\nThe Blue Jackets\u2019 offense has exploded since Carter\u2019s return, scoring 33 goals in his 5 games. That is an average of 3 goals\/ game. But the offensive resurgence has been led by three players, Scott Hartnell, Derick Brassard, and Brandon Dubinsky.\n\nHartnell is 5-5-10 in his last 13 games. Scott is tied w\/ Nick Foligno for the team lead in points (21) and leads the team in goals (9 ) and is tied w\/ Fialk for +15 on the season.\n\nBrassard has 11g-17a-28p in his last 30 games. Brass is +26 on the season which ties him 2nd on the team with Nick Foligno. The Jackets have scored 3 goals or more in three occasions in their last 5 games and the Pens have conceded 6 goals or more 3 times in their last five games.\n\nDubinsky has been tremendous during

{"id":1379,"ended":true,"length":606,"text":"Invisible rail = The invisible rail, Wallace's rail, or drummer rail ( Habroptila < unk > ) is a large flightless rail that is endemic to the island of Halmahera in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, between the islands of Halmahera and Timor, where it has declined by about 70% over a two year period.[1] The Halmahera rail is characterized by an enormous head crest which is used to defend the body; the crest is often used for display and for hunting, and it also conceals the eyes and ears. It is the largest land rail in the world.\n\nIt makes a low \"clucking\" sound as it walks, which is probably due to the long, thin tongue that covers the back of the mouth.\n\nThe most famous story about Halmahera rails concerns one in 1961 on Halmahera known as the Wallaces rail. In 1954 a Dutchman, Henry Lammers had found a number of the birds (apparently with their young) lying dead on the side of the road. Henry Lammers found several other specimens and killed one, before releasing the bird back where it was found. A series of photos taken by Henry Lammers in the following year showed a bird with its tail spread sideways like wings; however, Lammers was unsure if that was actually what was happening. He died in 1967 and the details were lost.\n\nIn 1974, the bird was discovered again. This time it was a female with her eggs; a few weeks later she was sitting on five eggs. Later the same year she laid another six eggs. The following year, at the beginning of December 1976 a female rail lay her first egg near the town centre of Halmahera. It didn't hatch.\n\nOn January 30, 1977, Lams' first egg hatched, two days later it had two, six days later it had four. All hatched by February 14. It took eight days for the first chick to leave its egg.\n\nIn 1978, it laid six eggs, eight days after they were laid the first chick hatched. A second chick hatched four days later and was fed in the same nest which housed four more chicks. It took two weeks for the last chick to hatch.\n\nAs of January 1, 1980, there were 16 Halmahera rail chicks in existence.\n\nThe female Halmahera rail can lay at least 6 eggs in a season, sometimes as many as 8 or 9. She incubates them for 9 to 10 days, and then cares for the young for 3 to 4 weeks or until they are able to fly. She is highly intelligent and capable of hunting. In the wild, they nest in holes in rocks or on the grass, with the eggs placed directly on the ground. The female can be extremely protective of her young and the other birds in the group.\n\nAll rail species have a cloacal flap which enables an egg to be excreted and then fertilized without the need to be laid. The young bird hoover up any water in the feces. At the age of 14-16 the male and female meet, exchange the eggs and fly off with the chicks.\n\nThe Halmahera rail may eventually become extinct if deforestation is allowed to continue.","token_len":679,"entropy":[10.9898,10.855,7.2483,6.6087,5.7364,0.4951,3.8296,15.3435,2.0056,4.8778,0.9167,3.1307,13.5764,4.152,3.7644,16.8779,6.8151,9.617,9.4024,8.1922,10.0261,5.5081,4.7028,2.1548,4.6595,1.6456,5.6767,9.5758,0.6733,3.6097,1.9068,1.8026,10.5474,0.1941,1.2704,4.9023,1.0493,7.8351,5.0618,7.7091,0.2831,2.738,4.7661,5.5768,0.0419,0.0,1.3022,1.4103,2.3258,5.0924,1.3751,2.9596,0.0554,4.825,0.0323,0.0033,0.0126,0.2765,5.9388,0.7112,2.3985,3.5233,0.5738,2.633,7.8078,2.9041,2.3935,4.028,0.9402,1.7385,4.4465,4.6418,3.6849,0.0726,5.6252,1.6769,0.1128,1.901,7.5903,0.0331,0.0016,0.1534,2.3646,1.2106,5.4351,0.0464,3.1954,4.8228,5.952,6.7902,4.0389,1.7168,5.2076,0.9145,6.9808,1.3938,4.7418,6.3434,1.6218,4.574,1.0047,4.2584,2.8184,2.8695,6.7505,2.5935,3.1851,5.9278,2.1786,1.5669,2.4205,3.4558,6.9279,0.0108,0.8374,5.3552,1.9543,2.2596,1.8538,2.1798,0.7521,3.049,2.0917,5.7112,2.708,0.7426,0.5012,0.2884,2.0249,1.5772,0.0012,3.6922,6.3482,1.8504,6.0941,6.6586,5.6436,7.4121,0.632,0.2408,3.6791,0.7416,5.8268,2.0779,3.0652,0.9473,5.3279,2.0589,0.0199,0.9682,5.0823,2.5168,3.1962,5.956,1.9754,4.6854,0.5436,4.7774,0.213,0.2235,2.4323,0.8051,1.63,0.0002,1.8333,5.1474,2.5581,6.864,1.2528,3.0356,0.0114,0.001,0.0033,5.8522,7.121,3.7447,4.8797,6.7486,5.4474,4.3182,0.1039,0.0216,0.0304,9.8245,0.1034,1.6106,7.1628,8.6983,7.1367,0.9354,2.8465,6.0366,2.4733,4.8179,4.5462,2.839,5.7469,4.4599,6.3,6.7152,4.5099,0.9917,5.7865,0.0088,4.0457,7.1808,5.0756,7.0245,0.2742,4.5797,3.5047,7.1401,1.36,4.6106,3.6232,1.0905,0.5884,4.1691,0.0238,0.8508,2.1952,1.4867,3.7533,4.5579,0.007,3.2654,4.1973,3.3217,6.7577,3.0309,6.3167,2.3936,2.9155,5.4316,4.8912,0.8898,4.7697,3.5741,5.5718,0.3369,1.3479,1.3646,0.7029,3.762,5.3068,0.005,4.5849,3.434,1.0402,2.6116,0.2561,0.0088,2.0833,2.5443,5.5188,0.3166,2.5887,2.3318,3.7984,2.126,2.2658,2.8749,6.0959,8.0516,4.7372,6.1501,4.1335,4.5146,0.3309,4.3398,0.0053,2.1029,5.2467,1.7015,3.5681,0.5335,3.216,3.93,2.0085,2.5517,0.8083,2.8249,6.3785,1.2814,3.8969,2.0818,1.7872,7.4677,3.4737,3.0493,2.1141,0.8994,0.0002,2.3849,3.9032,1.2883,2.0478,5.9174,0.7176,2.4615,4.8205,2.764,1.9002,0.0493,1.4912,0.4637,3.5438,3.3291,3.2101,2.8955,4.864,6.358,3.6621,3.4764,2.4316,0.2189,2.7188,0.7189,7.3478,0.7447,9.8089,1.8698,1.7856,5.3051,3.1477,2.2789,0.2609,3.1846,5.4179,2.9377,3.7354,0.5553,1.3903,1.8461,4.4573,0.1122,1.5212,4.4655,0.9716,3.6511,0.0032,5.6944,3.5616,3.0104,2.6614,8.4597,6.7653,3.7507,2.1944,1.3017,6.7485,0.8417,4.379,6.5535,0.9508,2.208,0.0338,0.0007,0.0026,1.0304,2.5686,6.3583,0.0013,0.9608,2.3352,1.4678,0.0002,4.2801,2.7898,3.9584,0.5319,1.1389,0.6555,5.7633,5.8708,5.6372,4.8627,2.4957,3.3432,2.0803,5.5487,1.5337,1.8224,2.2948,2.5641,4.5115,3.9541,5.6086,6.418,2.1399,1.2698,0.3209,2.5448,0.8452,5.3075,7.8936,3.4203,3.3222,3.3907,1.2848,3.4242,3.8488,4.2797,1.0346,0.7162,0.7311,2.8481,4.8274,0.1678,5.5518,3.1814,2.0207,2.176,1.7666,0.0002,1.835,2.2141,0.7715,3.8952,4.8527,3.5871,0.4075,1.7407,4.9549,0.9956,2.0386,4.9764,1.403,1.2833,5.1427,2.0226,2.7853,1.8872,0.5126,4.2393,2.8391,0.7685,1.3774,4.3533,0.5082,0.1221,2.0987,2.7448,5.4804,3.9701,1.6868,0.84,7.445,4.902,4.228,3.882,2.6619,0.6865,0.4006,2.4509,2.0173,2.9357,1.4892,0.3576,0.4399,3.3796,0.235,0.0859,2.047,0.7334,0.7159,0.0001,5.2048,1.3845,2.8074,2.7402,0.1733,2.4144,0.4157,2.2508,1.3238,5.4322,3.7087,0.0092,0.0018,0.0331,1.4341,3.7793,1.7622,3.6434,0.8347,1.4518,0.0002,1.978,6.021,3.6084,0.0016,0.0006,0.0038,1.177,4.2639,5.1425,4.4719,0.4589,4.352,1.5879,2.3888,1.3561,4.2227,1.5465,4.965,2.7249,0.3068,0.0046,3.5706,3.41,0.7548,0.5995,3.5079,8.2558,0.0082,3.3909,1.7964,6.9859,2.2146,2.6784,0.2462,1.7903,2.1518,1.4869,11.3189,0.125,1.9497,2.8514,2.579,3.3376,0.5508,0.4402,1.1755,4.949,2.0216,0.7632,1.0931,3.3312,0.0033,3.7061,0.8932,2.1748,2.7838,5.2726,2.3179,0.7956,4.7222,0.1046,5.2181,2.1615,3.8789,2.0704,1.3123,0.9914,3.9503,6.0656,0.804,5.5716,1.451,3.3186,1.6569,3.3858,1.6881,4.6186,2.1169,4.2775,1.5505,4.254,4.5692,4.6374,1.6731,0.9603,1.3576,0.8332,2.2247,2.981,2.7115,2.832,4.5034,4.6054,0.819,0.8402,0.709,1.4764,3.9932,6.0483,1.7696,3.1368,0.7094,2.5899,1.1372,1.2262,0.0001,5.2866,6.5131,5.863,1.6561,1.4353,8.522,2.6015,0.2119,4.767,2.9916,5.2004,5.2395,2.9099,0.1861,1.5084,8.6605,0.1746,0.006,3.1342,3.0835,6.2371,1.2647,4.9265,1.6887,0.5144,1.8759,3.6146,3.8616,0.9576,1.5451,5.7847,5.7344,7.3623,6.9122,1.6423,1.7421,4.9874,4.8683,2.4501,0.6686,9.6765,2.7743,5.255,1.4035,2.9425,0.0059,4.2938,2.9141,1.8316,2.9695,3.8547,3.8025,0.5228,8.4094,2.2811,6.026,4.408,1.2719,1.1294,4.1917,1.8041,3.8679,0.8338,2.2227,0.558,1.3233,0.0002,1.5293,2.7607,0.0027,0.0005,0.0049,0.4965,4.5675,7.2325,2.3242,0.3456,3.8425,9.3091,2.3605,3.8094,0.311,1.6358,0.7415]}
{"id":2651,"ended":false,"length":593,"text":"I @ - @ 95 enters Delaware from Maryland southwest of Newark in New Castle County. From the state line, the highway heads east as the six @ - @ lane Delaware Turnpike, passing through Newark and Delaware City. On the way to the eastbound end of the turnpike at Lewes, the route is two lanes with a center-turn lane. At Lewes it heads north as four lanes with a center-turn lane; north of Lewes it becomes the Delaware Memorial Bridge, a four-lane toll bridge, carrying Delaware and New Jersey cars through the Delaware Bay into Lower New and Upper New York bays.\n\nThe route enters Delaware as a freeway, but quickly becomes an undivided highway with traffic lights. The last 6 miles ( 10 km ) of the turnpike to its northern terminus in Bear are at grade; the road crosses the Christina River with a drawbridge between Newark and the New Castle city line, where the turnpike is ended by U.S. Route 202 ( US 202 ), which continues south as New Castle Bypass.\n\nHistory\n\nThe initial proposal for a modern highway through the area connecting Wilmington and Baltimore included a toll bridge and toll road through the Christina and Elk rivers, with connections to U.S. Route 322 ( US 322 ). The plans went forward despite opposition as part of the interstate transportation system; construction costs were originally estimated at $35 million, although this was later revised to $60 million. In 1957, preliminary construction of a four-lane toll road between Wilmington and Newark was begun. With the addition of turnpikes at the west end of both the Interstate 95 and U. S. Route 113 turnpikes, Delaware would again be linked by modern highways, and would have a major north-south artery between Wilmington and Newark for the first time since the turnpikes were first constructed.\n\nConstruction on the toll road came to a halt due to lack of funding, but the project was revived in the 1970s, and the segment between Newark and Bear began construction in 1983. The first segment opened in 1985, and the second segment opened in 1993. Between Newark and Bear the road is one mile (1.6 km), with the first 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) two lanes with a shoulder in the median. The toll road ends as US 202 north of Bear, with the road turning back to a straight two-lane highway.\n\nExit list\n\nAll U.S. Routes and state interstates are numbered according to the east-west direction of travel, which is also the order they are numbered in Delaware by the state highway department for most US and Delaware routes. In the exit numbering system, US 301 (and the subsequent Delaware Route 302 east of Newark) is eastbound and US 301 is westbound, as is US 301 between the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the Delaware Turnpike.

{"id":4497,"ended":true,"length":584,"text":"The pyramid of Unas is part of a larger mortuary complex built around it. It was approached via an ancient lake on the shores of which Unas'valley temple was located. This lake has been destroyed by erosion. The temple complex consisted of a series of buildings including the huge pyramid of Unas, a central temple, two side edifices, a gateway, a temple burial chamber, and an open area ( see map below ).\n\nThis is the first find of the Unas period, and it confirms the existence of the pre-Necropolis civilisation that is believed to have flourished on and around the site of Tell el-Amarna.\n\nThe temple of Unas itself had an area of approximately 1,500 square metres, and was about 1.5m deep. Unas was not only a great general but one who enjoyed building and constructing houses : \"I built myself a mansion a hundred cubits long \".\n\nUnas is pictured here in the centre ( red circle ) of the red squares. In the corners of the square are the tombs of Igalit and Aarghul with the pyramid of Unas at its base.\n\nThe first layer and lowest portion of the pyramid (the largest ) consists of limestone. There is a carved stone face on the lowest level, but it is currently buried in the debris of the pyramid.\n\nDuring excavation in 1956 it was discovered that the uppermost layers consisted of a very fine limestone and therefore that the pyramid was of limestone rather than of red earth as was previously thought.\n\nOther tombs that were found at the temple complex are that of the high priest Neshtub the Elder and the high priest Aaqa. The most interesting of these is the burial chamber of Unas himself. It is said that it consists of a rectangular hall of approximately 2.5 by 3.5 metres. At each corner there are entrances leading to chambers. A massive limestone slab rests on the floor and is decorated with hieroglyphs. The slab has four entrances to the different chambers. The doors of the chambers are carved with an image of Unas and his hieroglyphs. In front of the entrance to one of these chambers is a large square pillar of wood and stone.\n\nThe temple itself is approximately 9m high and 50m long. It consists of two parallel walls facing each other. It is thought that at the centre of this complex were four main buildings : the main temple, an oracular temple, a gatehouse, and a mortuary temple for the ruler. The entrance to Unas' grave is located on the left-hand side of the main temple. In the corner of the same corner is a monument made of stone ( ) that appears to be an obelisk and a funerary sarcophagus.\n\nIn the centre of the southern wall are two large stone blocks with hieroglyphs that are carved on them. The blocks are situated close to each other and could be the remains of a column. The tomb of Unas is in the northern wall of the temple. In the north-west corner of the burial chamber ( next to the funerary sarcophagus ) are the tombs of Unas' consort Aaqa as well as the high priest Aaqa and high priest Neshtub.","token_len":682,"entropy":[11.5169,2.338,8.892,7.409,3.04,6.2415,0.0465,1.5663,2.0692,13.5534,0.0403,2.6754,3.6814,3.4983,4.5192,1.3304,2.229,2.0639,9.7844,6.0898,2.9769,3.2698,6.5056,4.1679,0.6347,4.7544,0.0401,4.0482,9.2498,0.0442,5.0017,13.042,0.901,6.7942,1.3995,2.1362,0.7047,3.2257,3.0161,3.2608,1.1685,6.5565,0.8843,4.5404,2.1204,1.7487,2.8804,3.3454,6.2364,0.0601,1.6015,3.5904,0.0026,3.6288,3.5607,1.7947,6.6815,2.7838,0.495,0.3514,0.0045,1.1343,2.4748,5.8699,3.5402,1.8136,3.7538,7.7917,9.9452,0.0509,0.001,0.7778,1.1841,5.5674,1.2463,1.0469,3.3979,6.6477,1.455,0.5574,1.3538,2.3253,4.2535,3.4984,4.9462,10.7164,4.1305,2.619,0.6277,1.5944,0.4971,3.8733,2.5517,1.214,2.4725,8.7429,0.5315,2.2799,2.294,0.0668,7.7749,2.1348,1.7751,1.7554,4.7433,1.1896,2.7797,0.0197,1.3258,6.5639,0.1089,4.9328,4.5873,2.1052,3.8089,3.0559,3.8119,3.966,0.0721,0.3117,2.5934,2.8765,5.7008,0.522,0.9894,1.7182,1.5722,9.0547,7.177,1.4627,4.8364,1.6176,0.8748,1.5257,0.0002,1.4104,4.4438,3.2502,1.2039,0.0164,5.6715,4.2991,3.3608,4.1754,0.4045,3.1514,2.8359,0.5672,1.7651,0.9778,0.5982,1.389,1.6607,1.5107,4.7867,2.7531,1.4676,0.6643,2.9018,3.6547,0.6149,4.6618,0.0263,1.1875,4.5051,3.1837,1.5162,3.7037,7.2533,4.1608,4.7323,5.9797,5.3854,5.6053,2.5121,4.7388,5.0924,9.2417,4.6478,4.2897,5.0878,5.0792,0.6293,5.3518,5.8297,1.9144,4.0878,0.0235,2.8596,8.2842,1.1981,0.0003,3.4745,0.075,2.7031,7.1008,1.9914,1.5246,1.6636,3.6656,5.0744,8.0568,3.4356,1.2272,0.8683,1.0149,6.8718,6.7184,1.7211,4.0237,0.957,8.2605,1.2945,0.3421,2.4072,1.428,1.7554,6.3212,0.0004,0.2891,7.3581,6.0085,5.113,2.7465,4.5608,5.7825,4.7858,5.0276,6.8196,1.7069,5.7342,0.5282,0.6035,0.0161,3.1985,1.6169,2.0754,0.6089,1.2025,0.0002,1.4463,4.4368,7.8523,6.177,7.3359,4.1849,0.049,0.5254,1.2352,2.9641,3.1843,5.4688,5.5576,4.6028,0.0386,6.1707,2.1712,4.2774,1.0475,0.914,6.885,2.3583,4.9012,2.3611,0.7875,6.3696,2.3107,1.4507,4.2861,1.9444,0.4922,6.7377,5.2799,1.4312,1.0671,6.9811,0.6253,0.6908,2.2916,0.547,1.1347,0.0002,6.0172,4.4246,3.4385,6.0272,4.758,0.1738,0.672,0.0911,1.0345,5.745,3.1355,3.6057,6.1479,0.054,2.0868,5.1167,3.5401,2.9924,3.4357,6.7045,5.3002,1.0969,3.107,1.3697,4.1334,5.9435,3.7007,0.0048,2.6545,9.0842,4.5412,5.9685,2.3098,3.3001,1.1918,0.2194,1.1109,0.0002,6.0789,6.5345,0.0003,4.0402,1.0614,1.0446,2.5368,1.2905,4.6121,4.0456,1.9586,3.8399,0.0648,2.6722,6.9148,0.5044,4.6559,4.5182,6.2797,7.9844,4.3854,4.408,1.5629,1.2517,4.3504,0.0545,3.653,5.5978,6.5666,2.2687,2.0169,4.7271,2.5744,1.5187,0.3064,1.4401,0.9797,3.2634,0.4702,1.2708,5.1549,0.0672,5.7711,1.063,2.9404,0.9539,3.3001,0.3835,3.9289,5.2093,0.0513,1.0623,5.2551,4.5723,3.4528,5.3668,2.9983,1.6835,0.3557,6.7095,1.7483,1.7891,0.2939,0.8493,1.7033,4.8685,5.0114,2.6339,2.3053,1.1736,7.0699,4.2511,0.5819,5.7084,2.841,3.4861,6.5216,6.0369,3.7117,5.8434,0.8486,1.0364,1.912,2.5604,1.7786,5.9298,0.1258,4.0525,0.0055,0.0006,2.0058,1.1088,1.6672,5.2178,2.6052,3.8836,3.6248,3.27,1.0274,6.2475,1.2396,1.0074,1.4958,4.5483,2.5632,0.5925,0.8887,0.6887,4.9187,1.4971,3.9112,4.9845,0.1009,3.339,0.0358,2.3661,3.4605,6.9732,0.0354,0.0018,0.3845,0.7354,3.6046,5.2454,0.1257,0.6548,1.246,2.431,4.3216,0.5909,3.0099,0.1173,0.6687,0.4533,2.174,5.1376,6.0838,2.4151,5.4505,2.8726,1.7574,0.9577,1.581,0.0002,1.1865,2.9484,3.3962,1.1694,5.5518,4.9303,1.1572,1.4892,1.1958,6.0904,0.2449,2.3702,0.7177,1.3463,3.2862,0.0483,2.8683,7.1149,3.8725,5.6532,1.1956,0.0065,0.9513,2.9302,1.0192,3.911,0.1663,3.978,1.346,2.4928,0.2737,2.1088,3.7762,2.9906,2.9327,4.3926,4.3674,3.2595,1.1545,3.4452,2.6627,1.0057,3.5216,7.3245,4.0794,2.8713,0.6159,0.8395,5.1721,1.1983,0.7136,1.2335,0.6277,5.6807,0.0015,6.5742,6.0175,0.7792,8.4378,2.7554,1.4721,3.9155,0.6101,4.0848,0.0053,0.8614,5.0582,1.7998,2.433,1.599,0.6515,1.6611,3.4136,0.1246,0.178,0.2471,0.3021,2.6285,1.2733,0.9597,3.3402,0.4263,5.7345,0.5381,0.3724,7.2794,5.4242,0.6441,0.6165,5.8848,5.2699,0.7124,2.2181,3.4158,5.9591,2.6533,3.7129,0.1091,0.7893,3.4976,5.5285,0.1081,0.0055,3.6384,2.7,6.9825,0.0011,3.6128,0.0019,0.0047,0.8246,1.1593,0.0002,3.1347,0.8182,1.3709,0.2451,0.3566,8.2084,2.292,2.1973,1.4566,2.091,2.4718,3.8623,2.3439,5.2322,0.0032,0.0008,0.0433,3.6994,1.7378,2.6646,2.1684,0.9124,0.5377,1.2266,2.6138,0.8154,5.9209,4.857,0.5065,1.3208,0.0079,1.1655,6.0852,0.9423,3.7593,2.3299,0.0124,1.8274,7.5955,2.6775,1.1949,4.8334,0.7148,1.7666,0.0034,1.0937,3.0925,0.4715,4.7472,1.0779,1.3239,0.2021,1.2491,1.3272,2.7406,0.3453,3.829,2.7363,1.386,0.824,0.5362,0.1772,4.1138,0.0572,4.7764,6.3067,0.4566,0.3455,6.6049,0.0029,0.0201,0.0034,0.002,0.2636,1.5862,1.8576,4.2924,0.0007,0.0601,4.1472,0.0095,2.8989,8.0967,0.0594,2.5482,1.3992,0.0166,5.2444,0.0361,0.0051,1.0701,4.0196,0.0517,0.8122,0.2582,0.0102,2.291,5.3343,0.0373,2.4762,0.1234,0.0071,0.0216,0.7699]}
{"id":2825,"ended":true,"length":578,"text":"On 23 October 1862, Otto of Bavaria, King of Greece was deposed in a bloodless coup. The Greeks were eager to have someone close to Britain and Queen Victoria replace Otto ; however, King Constantine VIII of Greece, Otto\u2019s uncle, was not an able or interested candidate.\n\nBaroness Elizabeth of W\u00fcrttemberg, the wife of Charles Frederick, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg had grown up in the court of Alexander I of Russia, the last czar of Russia and was familiar with the Greeks, and Queen Victoria. At the suggestion of Queen Victoria, and Countess Moll of Darmstadt, Lady Wolff, the German Empress consort had set up contacts with Charles VIII of Greece who had been in touch and was a friend of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, the youngest son of Victoria.\n\nAfter a careful selection, Charles chose the Baroness Elizabeth of W\u00fcrttemberg as his consort, on the 2 January 1862.\n\nSoon after the marriage, Charles was recognized as King of Greece in Athens. Prince Arthur was made Vice-King of the Hellenes.\n\nCharles soon had to settle domestic feuds within and outside Greece ; his father and siblings were the most prominent\n\nHowever, the Greek army mutinied. The Crown Prince was captured and murdered in February 1862, his mother was taken prisoner and brought to Germany. She was made the prisoner of the Countess Moll of Darmstadt, whose daughter Princess Sophie ( who married Prince Leopold ) also became a prisoner of Greece. Queen Victoria, however, had expressed her strong desire that the Baroness Elizabeth of W\u00fcrttemberg be released from her prison. Her desire was respected.\n\nPrince Leopold of Bavaria was also made hostage ; however, he succeeded in escaping from captivity. The Baroness left Greece under a British flag on the 27 April 1862.\n\nIn Greece, King Charles was deposed and replaced by Lord Granville for the time being.\n\nQueen Victoria sent her grandson Prince Arthur and his wife Countess Sophie von Moll, as representatives of the British government in the Hellenic court to help the Baroness Elizabeth of W\u00fcrttemberg to regain her freedom and to negotiate her release from the Greek custody.\n\nThey were to visit Prince Charles in his prison and persuade the Greek court to release her. The countess and prince were told to look well dressed and elegant, since they were expected to meet and talk with important Greeks, and to take back in a diplomatic manner any news of the negotiations.\n\nWhile preparing for her trip, the countess dressed and perfumed herself every day and took care to have her makeup perfected.\n\nFinally the Baroness was released from the Greek custody under the condition that she leave Greece, and not to return to the Greek territory. However, King Edward VII dismissed the Countess of Moll of Darmstadt as his emissary and asked the Baroness of W\u00fcrttemberg to replace her.\n\nThe Baroness left Greece on the 21 December 1862,

{"id":2994,"ended":true,"length":542,"text":"The classic view of Domitian is usually negative, since most of the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had notoriously difficult relations. Furthermore, contemporary accounts have not treated him positively either, as they criticized him for a variety of misdeeds, such as his brutal, intolerant, and despotic rule ( L'Esprit des lois, 1.15), which had an extremely negative impact on the Roman public and his own subjects. However, it is important to remember that, in the early third century AD, the Roman Senate held a great and popular admiration and devotion toward Domitian because of his impressive military campaigns and victories against the barbarian tribes, which had significantly improved the Roman empire and its security and prosperity.\n\nDomitian was not only a great general but one who also excelled in public speaking. Domitian was born a Roman citizen of the plebeian class, but his family was among the more distinguished and powerful ones in the service of Rome. He was a descendant of the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero and his wife, who was a granddaughter of the consul Gnaeus Julius Caesar Augustus, who founded the Roman empire. Domitian\u2019s mother was a Vestal Virgin ( Vestalis Virginis ). Domitian was a devout supporter of the religion of his predecessor, Hadrian, and his mother was a priestess in the cult of Venus.\n\nAlthough being of the plebeian class of the Roman Empire, Domitian was also well educated, which helped him to become a successful general in combat and eventually the Emperor, during his lifetime and after his death. He was also praised for his political acumen by the Emperor Gallienus, who remarked that Domitian was able to master any situation without being influenced by circumstances. Despite some minor blunders during his early rule, Domitian had shown himself to be a very talented, wise, and successful Emperor and his rule was highly praised and supported by many contemporaries. Not only this, Domitian was very well-loved among the Roman people and even later, his memory in the ancient sources is preserved as a hero who excelled at military affairs.\n\nConsequently, the most popular contemporary source relating to Domitian\u2019s time as Emperor was the Eulogium on Domitian by the Roman philosopher and senator Velleius Paterculus. This essay is an abridged version of the Eulogium on Domitian, which in its original text can be seen on p. 16-18 of L'Esprit des lois. Domitian\u2019s character is also covered in various authors' speeches ( e.g. Gallivanus, 3.2; Tacticus ) as well as in Domitian's own poems ( Domitianus, 9.1-2; Domitianus, 7.28). Furthermore, Domitian's character and his policies are discussed in detail in the Eulogium on Caligula by the philosopher and Roman senator Plinius Secundus ( 2.29- 31). This is another excellent source about Domitian and Caligula which can be found on p. 42-43 of L'Esprit des lois.","token_len":684,"entropy":[8.8583,6.46,0.8203,10.6453,4.8794,0.8212,2.781,7.0574,7.2789,1.1923,4.1011,5.1121,1.251,0.8414,10.9557,5.524,3.8556,7.7815,0.1447,1.4361,12.6652,1.7769,4.952,7.5673,0.0365,4.5935,1.6792,3.8115,6.4329,1.7399,0.0213,0.0481,2.7328,10.5547,7.8393,0.9369,0.2816,5.8922,0.0067,6.8467,2.8959,3.7443,3.2198,6.5584,3.0916,4.6614,4.8617,1.1318,2.4105,3.3096,9.7823,1.0124,0.3961,4.231,2.8847,0.0013,4.5974,1.1194,0.0007,1.0812,1.8252,0.0008,1.7249,7.289,4.8316,6.5905,0.0149,1.7069,0.5304,6.0656,0.0415,3.1107,4.4956,11.3502,3.7284,1.8246,1.5561,1.3775,3.684,7.5978,1.8251,2.2891,4.714,2.2991,5.091,3.2972,3.3841,3.2421,4.1335,3.8462,2.1813,1.5217,0.067,1.2496,3.8208,5.0611,2.8296,4.1199,2.8748,6.7795,0.9348,3.8396,0.0157,3.05,0.5423,2.5163,0.0494,2.4068,0.1232,3.0987,1.99,1.374,2.51,5.5253,0.1018,2.0991,0.1197,1.7804,3.3836,3.2739,5.0033,1.6917,4.0716,5.2952,5.3252,7.3669,4.3396,5.3297,4.1784,0.8001,0.0018,0.0036,5.3025,0.8189,0.3332,6.0666,3.0473,8.0654,1.5351,4.6203,2.3165,1.0713,3.7476,0.0012,3.2102,2.511,1.8222,2.6134,6.1806,3.1324,1.0088,2.4347,3.6729,2.6997,2.981,5.6943,2.2691,1.9677,0.3179,1.4271,0.0032,2.5461,0.0021,0.0051,1.6904,3.1216,1.7344,0.9682,2.4407,3.1315,2.1682,4.3494,3.4258,5.0438,5.2433,0.0002,0.2975,5.0793,4.483,1.0911,3.6374,0.0033,0.0066,1.3666,5.5396,4.6182,1.5544,0.94,1.7241,1.7499,8.9009,0.5675,0.2263,3.6109,1.0473,3.1789,1.6368,2.2991,1.7827,5.3186,0.1018,4.8648,3.5737,2.2157,3.0497,6.1718,0.9076,0.4549,9.3599,0.1225,2.051,0.5963,1.8584,0.9525,2.3112,4.4517,0.0227,1.1296,3.7867,7.072,1.166,2.6237,4.5568,4.1183,0.0005,2.9899,2.6083,2.9009,1.125,3.9381,1.7816,1.6717,5.3645,0.0541,1.0138,6.5875,0.8089,5.9923,6.4798,0.0264,4.6336,1.6203,4.2243,1.5779,2.0123,4.8545,0.3904,1.6729,2.5316,1.2683,2.0335,0.0012,0.0032,16.4824,8.0715,5.0209,2.4041,1.1962,1.6033,9.3811,0.4419,3.9395,2.7766,10.2179,5.0686,6.3944,1.9642,3.8671,3.5275,0.0023,0.0061,1.266,2.0764,4.2067,6.8249,0.0531,0.587,5.6838,0.2359,2.8447,7.3798,0.4932,6.5347,0.0177,0.5956,0.9716,2.2034,2.6492,1.2301,1.1288,5.2738,0.7636,3.6557,0.7795,5.8534,0.1605,6.7106,1.0888,1.9139,0.0002,4.3597,7.5654,3.1865,2.3017,4.5032,0.0182,0.0257,0.57,5.2704,1.3638,1.9053,1.7348,0.2049,0.3094,0.001,0.0028,0.8576,2.6108,4.2586,1.9894,1.6715,3.8959,3.9334,0.8633,0.7699,2.0653,0.831,3.0313,2.3516,1.7269,6.8898,1.6318,5.9664,3.5568,4.1251,2.8749,4.6219,1.3889,2.8278,4.9646,3.7007,1.2402,0.5052,0.5058,1.696,0.9201,1.7291,7.6683,0.9433,0.3475,4.5136,6.0526,0.0024,4.0285,1.311,3.1307,5.2289,3.2536,0.0055,0.9359,0.5449,4.8174,0.4708,1.4069,0.0015,0.0029,1.1339,4.6157,0.0637,7.05,5.3979,3.4864,3.7914,2.7373,3.7045,0.1828,5.8724,0.6773,5.3849,4.9968,3.3848,6.3846,0.0275,3.2461,0.3199,4.3831,6.9901,0.2415,0.7316,0.0007,0.003,3.8388,5.6336,4.2794,0.8333,0.0452,0.9291,2.834,4.7562,4.4381,4.5008,0.8806,0.2539,4.0124,6.8688,2.6009,2.8724,4.5038,1.3349,5.2027,1.8952,2.6707,4.6351,0.3109,2.7644,5.7995,0.6848,6.874,0.74,3.4362,0.0893,2.6811,0.0006,0.0025,0.9721,4.3959,2.069,1.8205,2.5126,2.6852,3.0116,0.9227,1.9553,1.5672,1.332,2.8943,6.6821,1.9686,2.7631,7.3054,5.1251,1.2545,6.0376,5.2717,2.8918,2.459,2.8382,0.9681,7.3132,4.1119,6.7451,0.0003,2.6817,2.3862,2.7552,0.9532,0.4383,0.0002,5.2353,4.1627,0.0651,0.0235,1.9676,3.6918,3.8028,6.3112,4.5809,5.6472,0.3522,0.3537,0.0004,0.002,3.4082,0.0284,0.0164,4.2326,2.0942,2.4157,2.7905,0.9942,6.2465,4.458,0.5689,1.0544,6.0817,5.6476,0.0427,0.1567,6.8228,2.3189,3.4797,4.0418,2.5948,5.9701,5.1063,7.9069,1.1498,4.181,4.0986,3.1184,1.0552,2.3638,6.5979,2.0411,2.7503,6.3593,0.0026,0.7526,0.6499,0.0473,1.1674,2.7851,0.0055,0.0254,0.0051,1.4251,0.0817,0.0004,0.0023,1.4359,1.5521,5.4997,2.0005,1.3364,4.4871,4.914,0.1392,2.7717,4.3424,4.8536,0.2443,4.9797,4.3166,1.9846,2.2053,4.1637,0.1113,0.2266,0.0028,0.0009,0.0983,0.0209,0.0023,0.9211,4.2284,0.0021,0.0061,1.7516,0.0218,0.1708,6.0022,1.6182,3.1985,6.5709,0.3263,4.7998,6.7019,2.0141,6.7557,3.7612,5.3553,0.0943,0.0146,1.342,6.7665,8.6919,2.4433,1.1296,5.2472,0.1825,3.685,2.9981,4.9648,9.7015,1.6389,9.1426,3.233,0.1414,0.0308,1.0566,6.0452,0.0205,0.0175,0.7592,3.0191,5.5668,1.6739,5.3048,0.0532,0.1406,5.6622,1.3868,4.9353,0.1489,2.0783,1.1412,2.9928,1.5503,4.3845,0.0241,0.0366,1.6397,0.1369,2.8435,0.0526,5.2157,1.814,5.0099,0.0058,2.6732,0.0012,0.003,1.7456,5.1894,2.5149,2.98,6.866,1.4,3.6362,0.3189,4.2308,0.1923,1.2268,3.5883,0.0213,0.0146,0.0025,0.2923,10.2668,0.5724,0.0285,3.4453,1.3827,2.8827,1.3831,5.6673,0.9093,4.4681,5.54,0.5145,7.8426,0.5522,0.1704,1.4288,3.9622,0.1203,4.9426,0.9858,8.9584,1.9412,4.134,2.7277,4.6118,3.1511,0.8013,4.6837,0.558,0.0007,0.0036,2.2243,7.0908,0.0009,0.0065,4.0402,2.8063,0.2048,0.3987,1.1302,0.7471,0.0029,5.4492,1.464,1.1219,0.1107,0.4389,0.0029,0.0595,0.0008,0.0008,0.0037,0.001,0.0047,0.3622]}

It is located near the center of Sofia, on the corner of Vazgen Sargsyan and Nadezhdy Streets, on land which had been given to the church in the 17th century in return for the donation of Sofia's water supply system. The Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension was originally built with Russian architecture. The main spire and bell tower of the cathedral were designed to be in accordance with the plans of the prominent Russian architect Dimitar Bouni. The project included a church, a bell tower and a bell house. The total area of the planned structures was 17,935 sq m, almost all of which was occupied by the church and its surroundings. Construction of the cathedral was started on October 6, 1731 under the direction of the Russian monk Krestianos (Pavlyuchencko), and was completed in 1759. The architect Dimitar Bouni was brought by Bounikos and his brothers into the Bulgarian-Russian Company, whereupon he began to work on Bulgarian projects. He worked to renovate the Cathedral of the Holy Grace in the center of Sofia. Bouni also designed the monastery of the Holy Saviour on the Black sea (1733).

{"id":165,"ended":true,"length":606,"text":"Cresswell retired from playing as a result of an eye complaint and a knee injury. York drew 1 \u2013 1 away to Burton Albion, with an own goal scored by Shane < unk > Wilson \u2013 on his debut \u2013 bringing the visitors level after a goal from Billy Clarke had turned the game on its head, while York made two changes off their first-team, with Chris Wood and Paul Taylor coming in for Liam Palmer & Mark Marshall.\n\nWith the home side not having scored for 270 minutes, they began the game brightly and Clarke fired them into an early lead with a close-range header on five minutes. In the 25th minute Luke Tindle was denied by a superb one-handed save from Paul Thirlwell but the home goalkeeper had to be at it again a few minutes later to keep Liam Davies\u2019 glancing header from Taylor\u2019s cross at bay.\n\nThe game became a little scrappy as both sides struggled to get any attacking momentum, but the breakthrough finally came in the 30th minute. Matt Harrold\u2019s cross from the left found Billy Clarke on the edge of the six-yard box and he made no mistake in side-footing home from close range for his seventh goal of the season.\n\nThe floodgates seemed to have opened and the hosts were almost behind again just a minute later when Davies struck his shot from distance against the underside of the bar, but it hit the post to safety. Harrold then almost doubled his tally when his shot from the edge of the area came back off the woodwork, before Davies fired another effort wide from 20 yards. On the stroke of half-time a defensive mix-up between Davies and Jordan Clarke in the home side\u2019s goal allowed Paul Taylor to pounce on the situation and square the ball for Harrold, who curled a shot wide of the left post.\n\nThere was still plenty of half-time to be played though, and the match became less end of season friendly than a training session as it became end to end scrappy. Thirlwell had to make his best stop of the match four minutes into the second half in the form of a close-range effort from Davies, before York made history in the 51st minute by scoring for the first time in three games in front of their own fans as Cresswell\u2019s deep cross was met by Wood with an overhead kick at full stretch to see the ball come back down to the left foot of an unmarked Taylor and he steered the ball home.\n\nThe visitors looked to have grabbed themselves a third in the 71st minute when Chris Wood latched onto Liam Davies\u2019 through pass before smashing the ball high into the roof of the net \u2013 but the linesman\u2019s flag had been raised for a foul in the build-up, denying the striker the chance of a second goal of the game.\n\nIn a rare attack for York the home goalkeeper pulled off another fine save a few minutes later to push Chris Wood\u2019s powerful drive over the crossbar, while Clarke had a couple of half-chances to extend Burton \u2018s

{"id":1234,"ended":true,"length":602,"text":"The jury delivered a unanimous guilty verdict after three hours of deliberations. In the sentencing phase of the trial, Abu @ - @ Jamal read to the jury from a prepared statement.\n\nThe defendant received 30 years for first degree murder in a separate trial. \"We, the people of Louisiana, will not stand by and watch an entire generation systematically killed, \" Jindal said as he announced the guilty verdict.\n\nBond did not include a no-contact order against the victim. \"In a case like this, nothing can restore the mother's child,\" said Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Thompson, and that \"the defendant will ultimately pay for his heinous crime.\"\n\nThe jury will now determine if the man receives life in prison or the death penalty.\n\nAbu Abdullah Jamal pleaded not guilty to those four charges. The incident is part of a trend of police mistakenly killing residents in their homes. He was also convicted of criminal damage to property, but that charge was dropped as part of his plea deal. Abu Abdullah Jamal is a U.S. citizen who has been residing in Baton Rouge since 1996.\n\nJudge Keith Comeaux said he could decide on bond for Abu Abdullah Jamal, who is currently charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of a man early Wednesday, within the next hour.\n\nAbdullah Jamal will be back in court early next year for sentencing.\n\nHe then pulled out a gun and reportedly told them to leave their vehicle. According to the criminal complaint, Abu Abdullah Jamal fatally shot 19-year-old Gavin Jackson of Baker.\n\nShe said the shooting was completely avoidable.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has found that the right to keep and bear arms extends to the home, and the court affirmed in a 2008 decision that Louisiana residents have the same right to keep and bear firearms in their homes as members of the military.\n\nAn arrest warrant had been put out for Abdul-Malik but the U.S. Marshals Service said his wife had been taken into custody Thursday.\n\nHe said the arrest warrant was in reference to a warrant for drug and gun charges against Abdul-Malik.\n\nBaton Rouge police said Abdul-Malik was wanted in connection with the fatal shooting of 19-year-old Gavin Jackson in an apartment complex on Airline Highway Wednesday morning.\n\nGavin Jackson died at the scene of the early Wednesday incident. He told deputies that Jackson was a U.S. Soldier and was supposed to be going out of town that week.\n\nThe incident is part of a trend of police mistakenly killing residents in their homes.\n\nThe shooting occurred about 2:30 a.m. Wednesday inside an apartment at 10121 Airline Highway, near the BP station.\n\n\"He was trying to rob me,\" the woman said. She was able to get the gun away from Malek, according to the release.\n\n\"I do this for my family and he's put us all in this situation,\" she said.\n\nBut the woman told police she knew Malek.

{"id":1788,"ended":true,"length":615,"text":"In the chronic stage, treatment involves managing the clinical manifestations of the disease. For example, pacemakers and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti @ - @ arrhythmia drug amiodarone, have been used for decades to improve heart function and thereby survival rates. Antithrombotics such as the heparin drug have also been used for decades for treating angina.\n\nIn spite of current drug therapies being widely available, survival rates are dismal for the chronic stage of the condition. While the chronic stage may last for decades, the average time to develop chronic stage is believed to be five to six years. In terms of mortality, the chronic stage has only two to five per cent survival rate if untreated.\n\nThe cause of chronic disease may be genetic and environmental. The chronic stage is considered as a slow moving progressive disease ; one in which there is no obvious progression. As the patient is considered a typical chronic case, there is a high probability that the disease is an inherited one ( e.g. in family history of a heart ) and environmental causes such as increased risk of infection and malnutrition may contribute to chronic stage development.\n\nIn developing countries or in certain subpopulations, some patients may develop chronic stage despite having no family history of heart disease. There is a high prevalence of hypertension in this subpopulation. However, in many developing countries, lack of diagnosis of hypertension is an important cause of the high death rate in this subpopulation.\n\nThe main clinical presentation characteristic of chronic stage is a slow progressive nature, with recurrent chest pain for many of the affected patients. Patients with chronic heart disease often present to the hospital for the management of recurrent chest pain (often termed as \"chronic angina\" ) ; this occurs despite pharmacological and surgical interventions.\n\nIn this article, we review some of the diagnostic techniques used to identify patients with chronic stage of the disease, and we also examine the prognosis of patients with chronic stage disease.\n\nThe major problem with treatment of chronic stage of the disease is that it is usually symptomatic management. There is little in the way of disease modifying treatments.\n\nDISEASE MODIFIERS\n\nThe use of thrombolytics have been used for decades to reduce the risk of recurrent chest pain. The use of anti @ - @ arrhythmia medication has also contributed to improved survival in long term treatment of chronic stage of the disease. These drugs can significantly reduce the frequency and severity of cardiac symptoms, and thereby improve the quality of life of the affected population.\n\nThe incidence of chronic disease can be reduced by improving diet, physical activity, smoking cessation, blood pressure control and control of complications which include the use of cardiac surgery in some subpopulations ( e.g. end-stage heart failure and aortic stenosis ).\n\nIn recent years, a number of new approaches to reduce the risk of chronic stage of the disease through the use of novel anti @ - @ arrhythmia medications and genetic screening has been introduced. The best approach for the prevention of chronic stage heart disease remains unknown. In addition, there has been much effort in developing strategies to improve the early detection and early management of chronic stage. This would greatly reduce the likelihood of progression to end stage heart disease.\n\nIn this article, we review these novel therapeutic approaches.","token_len":688,"entropy":[2.6222,11.733,5.7918,1.0046,7.4847,4.7282,7.4541,1.6237,6.7101,2.6987,0.3458,1.9633,0.9353,1.6204,3.7446,0.8293,0.0189,9.9243,1.1379,0.0082,2.8047,4.5003,3.1484,8.2639,1.473,2.2753,0.0029,2.0817,4.0083,0.0005,3.3325,3.5035,15.8831,8.2956,8.9304,8.7459,0.0634,1.7561,0.5333,2.8022,7.1324,3.182,0.0134,0.0045,0.4085,2.4025,0.3785,2.9705,1.6771,3.3842,1.1222,3.8179,2.3971,1.5941,1.637,7.5208,8.9208,2.9765,0.6589,6.1318,4.6903,0.7495,7.6077,1.2536,3.5222,0.0007,2.3297,8.2737,0.9255,0.0125,4.1014,6.4799,1.0873,0.2967,0.8434,1.3528,2.0055,2.8205,2.0638,4.8653,0.0711,1.5353,1.7789,0.001,2.665,5.8183,0.0066,6.337,5.5398,3.1484,3.0282,3.8362,1.4144,0.5741,6.7146,1.2871,1.884,6.7059,3.2574,2.6329,5.0883,0.601,1.0033,0.9276,4.9457,0.4252,4.7801,1.8791,3.9428,0.1991,2.8065,4.0275,1.1056,3.0169,0.5337,1.6642,5.5947,3.9687,0.8953,3.9834,5.4988,4.5947,1.2277,7.979,0.0049,0.2647,3.863,0.5473,2.2448,0.1406,0.44,2.5791,5.0838,0.0009,2.615,0.5207,1.4366,2.2866,0.0421,3.0245,4.5718,3.8352,1.9318,1.5707,3.6247,0.31,0.7187,1.0201,7.1779,3.2353,0.3814,1.0891,0.0002,2.0037,5.7826,0.1228,2.3252,3.7015,3.9126,0.7313,3.9759,2.9526,1.0619,0.701,2.1907,4.2872,0.1124,1.4223,4.6508,4.5386,0.8413,7.2783,4.5096,6.1325,0.7575,11.6979,5.1082,2.7083,2.6923,3.9214,0.4122,1.4424,3.5687,2.6423,1.8242,4.408,2.4503,3.9114,3.0756,5.9903,3.6568,7.554,4.072,4.2571,0.359,2.6071,0.7065,1.0637,1.9579,1.8944,0.5751,1.2032,1.1304,1.8415,4.8415,1.6038,3.5278,3.7652,8.4141,0.2268,0.0051,0.3212,4.1473,6.9018,0.848,1.3081,3.3536,3.5304,12.6202,1.1007,8.0232,2.0963,2.1663,0.0024,5.8464,4.5267,0.3274,3.6862,2.1317,4.36,1.6507,3.1723,0.59,4.1072,1.4124,3.1124,0.2117,0.7233,0.0003,2.717,6.9932,1.8336,5.8935,1.8346,5.8382,3.5467,3.5311,0.0032,0.6387,4.6718,3.7054,1.7582,1.5424,1.4346,0.7059,5.2204,3.2817,2.2867,4.5187,0.0168,0.3089,1.7493,0.1429,0.6134,4.2097,1.0219,1.3525,1.7746,3.7933,0.1165,4.8855,1.3742,3.1774,2.5478,0.6873,1.0986,3.7239,0.0337,2.7788,2.5396,3.8892,0.0701,0.7212,7.1523,0.0112,5.628,0.6529,0.7539,1.2136,3.2096,0.9713,2.2026,0.2207,2.1512,4.2853,4.1808,0.6472,2.1003,2.0266,0.426,0.1676,0.2283,1.0088,0.0002,1.9998,4.3901,4.4654,5.3376,6.6711,0.1235,1.1991,0.3794,0.4072,2.1406,4.0991,3.5197,6.7661,2.4618,2.0584,6.0764,4.6093,0.4003,4.9136,2.6889,4.7234,0.0784,6.6179,0.474,0.6172,3.6316,1.7928,1.9135,4.776,0.24,2.5213,5.2114,4.1129,0.9799,2.3835,3.3472,4.2057,6.4799,0.0593,4.1581,0.3861,0.0959,3.8519,4.594,5.0206,4.3542,2.087,3.3837,0.085,4.7562,0.0766,1.9146,2.1645,9.0649,1.9789,4.204,5.0601,9.8097,0.6033,3.3432,2.3248,1.7261,1.0229,1.3969,0.0002,2.3885,3.6422,2.4962,0.3314,0.4869,3.7544,3.5508,0.406,0.0116,6.2625,4.1006,0.7732,1.0517,2.6282,2.2272,0.4297,0.3663,0.4584,3.7174,0.6364,0.2895,2.1699,1.8176,3.1316,3.0132,3.687,0.7331,5.9234,0.1974,0.7801,2.4678,0.7471,0.9113,0.2116,7.3467,0.912,0.8862,0.0002,2.543,5.793,4.9521,0.8678,4.4359,0.7397,0.4525,0.1987,1.4012,0.0894,0.0446,0.2289,0.9402,1.6417,0.905,3.8042,7.5012,0.0004,8.9722,1.7259,3.7411,0.8265,3.5795,4.9925,0.221,0.1547,0.003,6.7978,7.5258,3.9171,1.6529,2.755,0.0003,5.3052,6.0441,2.1938,4.6847,3.4528,2.4851,0.0502,0.3886,0.0002,1.7294,5.675,0.0103,7.3318,0.9269,0.9907,0.1642,2.1724,6.807,0.5859,1.6932,1.2194,1.5679,0.8158,3.3827,0.7196,1.0357,0.0415,3.1878,0.7984,0.0637,1.4218,2.2292,1.6364,0.0175,5.5386,3.5485,0.7777,0.4661,0.5808,0.0063,0.0196,0.0109,4.1123,0.9317,1.7125,5.8072,0.2724,3.6842,0.8608,2.5328,6.106,0.342,2.2945,1.5902,0.6746,0.2024,0.7487,0.0392,0.0174,0.1366,4.2011,1.7375,2.7242,4.4743,0.5122,0.3592,5.0741,1.5094,0.4703,0.0048,5.2858,5.5671,2.0464,1.8596,6.0386,2.0422,1.1215,1.776,0.066,0.1161,0.8741,0.9959,4.5885,4.8232,0.1408,0.5212,0.0002,2.0292,5.43,0.0898,2.1788,2.8132,3.9419,0.5413,1.4391,0.7499,4.8427,4.6863,1.0281,2.9752,0.1261,0.6724,3.9218,0.4273,0.5938,6.6221,0.286,1.1459,1.0113,6.9142,0.0506,8.3236,6.2843,3.9132,4.0438,3.0209,0.0032,5.3384,3.6094,4.3836,3.1642,3.7251,0.2084,0.007,3.0374,1.0945,0.0085,0.0008,0.0631,7.5476,3.2065,0.0258,3.2365,1.6656,2.7539,4.9962,1.0528,0.0093,2.0259,0.009,0.8668,0.7315,0.0003,2.8534,4.2216,0.1307,0.2889,2.7867,1.0849,0.0019,2.7589,3.9168,1.8771,4.2802,0.3212,1.4233,0.0469,1.4398,0.5819,0.5886,0.0422,0.007,8.9315,2.7922,0.2037,0.0012,5.9229,3.2365,0.2821,0.0777,0.0758,0.1488,0.0032,0.0034,0.0137,1.0523,3.7066,6.9123,4.0515,2.4167,0.2437,2.8932,0.4822,2.4118,5.19,2.614,2.8307,2.087,1.0725,0.2363,0.7826,0.1773,8.9829,0.6276,5.9737,4.9488,0.5438,3.3161,2.3561,0.2874,2.0776,3.0053,0.0986,3.7142,3.5484,2.0713,2.1146,4.6211,0.8904,2.5717,0.6588,7.5852,0.9232,0.9001,6.1137,3.2461,0.0138,1.1823,0.1948,2.1241,3.868,5.9968,5.4116,1.4898,0.1508,4.8277,0.1524,5.6542,1.5796,4.4624,0.6609,3.5204,0.4959,0.7805,0.2993,0.0002,2.7818,2.8122,0.4077,0.141,0.0705,1.2783,6.5536,3.7685,4.205,0.5291,1.8899]}
{"id":984,"ended":true,"length":657,"text":"Electronic Arts rebranded Flight Combat as Jane's Attack Squadron, to fit with the Jane's Information Group license that the publisher had used for its Jane's Combat Simulations line. According to EA, Attack Squadron is intended to appeal to female pilots who've always been interested in being able to pilot aircraft but have never been able to due to career or geographical restrictions. As the game is an arcade \"war game,\" it won't be an accurate simulation; the developer told Gamasutra the game has \"less realistic physics and more arcade-like mechanics.\"\n\nThe game is described by Jane's Information and Publishing UK as an \"arcade action combat game\", in which players use fighters against other planes. To keep players interested, the game will employ a campaign mode and multiplayer capability.\n\nOn the development side, Attack Squadron's developer is EA UK and its publisher is Electronic Arts. The game is a \"rebranded effort\", meaning that Jane's is no longer involved with the game and that EA will handle marketing and distribution.\n\nJane's Information Group previously licensed EA to develop its Jane's Combat Simulations series of flight combat games, using Jane's Combat Simulations as the game's brand. In 2011, EA UK took over development of the series and made a new title based on the Combat flight sims in 2011. However, EA UK still retained their name, as well as Jane's name, through the license agreement.\n\nThe original Jane's Combat Simulations was known for arcade-like graphics, but also featured a campaign mode, and was also available to online players. According to the game's box, Jane's Combat Simulations helped \"break the sound barrier\" and was \"the first serious effort to bring flight into the computer age\".\n\nThere had also been speculation that this was a potential license for an upcoming PC game under development at Red Storm Entertainment and Microsoft Studios, due to the fact that the website's domain name was already registered with the latter for the purpose of licensing it to EA. However, no PC game was ever formally announced, and there is no confirmed reason why EA would be using a flight game as one of its licenses for its upcoming PC strategy game.\n\nOn September 26, 2012, Electronic Arts announced that Electronic Arts UK would be rebranding the Jane's Combat Simulations line of games as Jane's Attack Squadron, to be targeted at women and a broader audience. This announcement coincided with a partnership with the Royal Air Force Girls Club, which offered free Attack Squadron software for members of the club, as well as a discount on Attack Squadron licenses. With Jane's Attack Squadron, EA planned to include the Jane's Combat Simulations gameplay into the new product, while making \"the entire experience more accessible\" for female pilots.\n\nEA later announced that the 2013 game in the Jane's Attack Squadron line would be a remake of Jane's Combat Simulations 4: Zero Hour. This new title would see the return of the combat mission and simulation features of the Combat Simulations games, while also removing the series' 3D graphics from the graphics engine and using a 2D style to maintain the arcade-like nature of the game.

{"id":610,"ended":true,"length":596,"text":"The contemporary reviews of `` Ulysses `` were positive and found no irony in the poem. Author John Sterling \u2014 like Tennyson a member of the Cambridge Apostles \u2014 wrote in the Quarterly Review in 1893 that Joyce `` is one of the greatest critics of literature that I have ever encountered, and no such critic as he exists anywhere ``.\n\nThere have been many, many reviews of Ulysses. But there are no reviews for those of us who remember the beginning of America's involvement in the First World War, and the beginnings of the U.S.'s entry into Europe's war on the side of the Allies. And there is no review for those of us who were kids at the time. To tell our kids about the First World War, we have to tell them more than the famous last line to this poem. Our stories have to begin on a certain day \u2014 Nov. 11, 1917.\n\nHere is the text of that poem, which is in many ways the first line and verse of our story. The line is:\n\nOn all hands -- men jostle for the rail\n\n\"What a long day's work for a young man's pride''\n\nI have to teach my son where and when this famous line was\n\nwritten. He asks when the poem was written, when\n\nthe Armistice was signed. When the guns fell silent forever\n\nin the muddy trenches of the Great War? He asks about\n\nthe poem's title: On All Hands. And when I\n\nanswer -- Nov. 11, 1917, when the last guns\n\nwere silenced -- I cannot tell him how deep into a\n\nhuman landscape I saw that day -- in the mud,\n\nthe blood and the bodies.\n\nHow much more than the poem itself can you tell him\n\nwithout crying? The first verse, written before\n\nAmerica sent hundreds of thousands of soldiers\n\ninto battle:\n\nOn all hands -- men of all nations -- young and old --\n\nShall read this poem ere they be laid in the earth.\n\nOr, as James Agee said of it: \"It is the\n\npoem of a great generation, America's own, of\n\nwhich you will not soon hear so much.''\n\nThose were the last lines before the war was over. But it came later to haunt us -- all of us.\n\nI see those images every year on the memorials to the\n\ndead of both nations.

{"id":3057,"ended":false,"length":705,"text":"Around the same time that she approached Carter about writing an episode, Anderson was also receiving offers from several television networks to direct shows. She, however, had never directed before, and the task was daunting. \"I didn't know if I had the physical control to do it,\" she says, \"or the confidence or the brain capacity.\" Carter's patience with Anderson was an influence \"I really have to credit him for. Because he knew what I was capable of bringing to the table.\"In addition, Anderson sought out advice, from others and from Carter himself. She and Carter, she says and, \"did some really intense one-, two-, and three-day retreat experiences where we had access to the writers and were able to have very frank and very honest and very open conversations about work issues as well as personal issues.\"Though the writing has become a bit easier \u2014 \"I can say 'no' to things much more easily,\" she adds, \"and I know how to say 'no' to myself in service of the show\" \u2014 Anderson still has to fight to maintain a healthy distance from the show that brought her to this place. She can watch or read criticism only if it doesn't directly involve her or the show (and if the criticism comes from a person she considers a friend or colleague). And although, \"I wish I could really take more time and dive in, I just have to keep it at a certain distance at all times,\" she says. \"Because this is such a strong calling of my life right now, this is something I do. I love this thing. It's my job. This is my livelihood. When I get into a place where the work or the process becomes my biggest passion and driving force, it's not right for me.\"That may sound dramatic, but, even for a director who says, \"I'm a bit obsessed,\" the truth is, it really is the job that can become her. And it's that place that, Carter says of her cast, \"is one of the most incredible things I've ever experienced. They're very, very grounded.\" That is an important quality in an ambitious director who, Carter says, \"wants to pull the show to an entirely different galaxy than we started in.\" And Anderson, he adds, would welcome it if others were given that privilege as well. \"There's a great chance it's going to work out, but at the same time, a risk... And there's a chance [someone else] could get hurt.\"So, as those risks are taken and that galaxy further pulled to the dark edges, it's on those left behind to keep the memory of these people alive. It doesn't matter that they may not know the people who have died, or that they may never have seen the work. Even with those thoughts, however, there's still a comfort in the idea that they will be around to see the final product through the eyes of the people who loved and lived and worked with them.\"I guess it almost takes me back to when [my sister] Mitzy died,\" Anderson says. \"That's what keeps me going and keeps me motivated...

{"id":4517,"ended":true,"length":642,"text":"In April 1945, Robertson returned to the field, replacing Alan Ramsay as commander of the 5th Division, which was then engaged in the final stages of the New Britain Campaign. In May 1945, on the request of the US commander, he was tasked to take control of the US Second Army. Soon, the Army made him commander of the entire Allied invasion force, which was assembling at Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides.\n\nAs Allied General Omar Bradley began to move the US Second Army away from New Guinea in July, Robertson became very concerned about supply support, fearing that by the time the Army reached the Bismarck Sea it would be running critically short of food and equipment. He also noted that the soldiers had become extremely depressed because the war seemed to be going against them. To try to lift their spirits, he began a series of daily \"parades\" in the Pia Pia area in the Bismarck Sea in which he encouraged the soldiers and sailors to perform in public. These parades, which were attended by many of the other Allied forces in the area, brought a great deal of attention to the British-Australian forces in the area, increasing morale to a high degree. At the same time, he attempted to improve the equipment that his troops were issued.\n\nDespite numerous attempts to persuade Bradley to keep the Army in the Bismarck Sea, Robertson felt that it would be unwise to ignore advances that might present themselves. He recommended to Bradley that the Army set sail for the Marshall Islands on 15 July, which would give the troops a month of rest on the way and could also provide better supplies and support. General Bradley accepted the plan on 20 July. Under the new regime of General George S. Patton, the US Second Army was able to move quickly and without significant opposition, reaching Tarawa on 28 August.\n\nOn 2 September, as the US troops advanced on Makin, the Japanese launched a desperate offensive with the intention of driving the Allied forces from the Gilbert Islands. The Allies quickly defeated this attack and retook Tarawa, earning Robertson the nickname \"the Conqueror of Tarawa\". The capture of Tarawa on 2 September also broke down the Japanese defense line to the north through the Bismarck Sea and the Caroline Islands. The capture of Tarawa, the biggest battle of the war on either side, was one of the main factors in the Allies' eventual victory. Robertson was awarded the Legion of Merit and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his efforts on Tarawa. The Japanese were forced to surrender within six months, on 11 September 1945. Robertson retired from the Army in June 1947.\n\nClick anywhere inside the article to add text or insert superscripts, subscripts, and special characters.\nYou can also highlight a section and use the

The underground train is expected to connect London with the city of Birmingham and a major European airport and is to run in 12 months.","token_len":701,"entropy":[7.9714,3.2472,0.1333,4.2192,7.1003,2.7698,9.0089,1.0274,5.8657,5.8833,0.7018,5.4107,9.0388,3.9774,0.9009,4.0152,3.432,0.5839,4.4988,3.4083,0.1611,0.0156,2.9198,5.0039,11.1573,5.9962,4.5957,2.4515,1.2548,12.2465,3.976,3.1383,3.7278,0.5581,6.1367,0.7133,0.7421,0.0167,4.7067,7.8809,3.0309,2.5919,5.0381,2.9221,4.3633,7.8441,4.4184,0.994,5.9438,4.3832,0.8312,5.0549,4.0068,3.6853,1.2814,6.2786,2.8666,1.1977,4.4278,2.3324,7.2164,0.5005,2.7321,3.1028,0.7031,5.7094,1.0152,0.5418,0.0004,5.9814,5.9112,0.0154,2.7612,7.0437,1.9064,6.6717,6.6374,3.1322,7.8905,5.1078,2.1411,2.9147,3.4925,0.0352,2.3016,5.9314,6.1056,2.357,3.133,2.6554,4.3153,1.5445,4.5832,0.7514,3.6299,0.0015,2.9742,0.5635,1.0472,1.3658,3.3077,2.1337,4.3269,5.6675,7.2276,7.9577,4.9265,5.6735,0.145,7.2053,0.102,7.1041,3.0412,7.3797,4.3792,3.3697,0.3562,1.6336,5.7358,2.7091,4.7833,0.0075,1.2557,4.4768,3.9777,0.3785,5.0985,7.2584,0.4533,0.1494,6.7903,6.3997,5.3691,0.1461,7.786,0.0142,0.6018,3.9566,2.8096,3.4824,13.9768,1.6123,1.4856,2.0002,0.811,2.0743,3.5403,3.51,2.091,1.3369,1.2442,1.1415,0.5452,0.0002,1.8844,6.5623,5.8011,0.2617,3.8191,6.4052,3.2497,0.3879,10.6622,1.1515,1.0572,5.5679,3.4711,0.3395,3.4155,4.702,2.3794,0.0331,0.0006,0.1444,0.0057,6.2711,1.5756,0.0463,7.3749,1.6754,2.5296,0.3547,1.0868,4.041,4.3946,1.6874,5.0558,7.7133,8.0095,2.8533,0.3415,0.9149,1.1361,3.9212,1.6062,7.3075,0.2171,5.601,4.7011,2.3865,6.0119,1.9943,6.9473,2.8045,6.6484,4.7554,0.5851,1.7632,1.441,2.8373,0.7337,4.1988,1.4393,7.3647,0.1434,1.3726,4.7184,5.9932,1.3594,4.3273,1.7621,4.4875,0.1977,4.1682,3.3616,0.8298,5.115,2.9348,9.527,0.22,1.6166,4.0756,2.3891,3.3539,1.1175,4.4509,1.2195,3.2977,0.0341,2.0002,0.6722,0.8767,0.4971,0.0002,6.1206,0.451,4.8776,3.1157,0.3356,0.192,5.0858,2.3838,2.1917,9.8263,1.0848,3.8877,4.4168,4.4301,0.4787,3.7249,1.4272,1.7675,0.966,7.7695,0.5253,1.6827,7.2076,0.9898,5.8425,0.6846,5.3717,2.4287,1.2443,6.5825,5.8631,9.5643,1.637,6.5811,0.4175,2.9193,1.4591,2.0042,0.5314,0.0032,0.0004,0.0379,0.0097,6.2388,1.6944,9.9625,2.7064,3.7654,2.7879,0.2934,4.4404,1.3717,6.5357,0.2223,1.5989,5.2379,6.0886,1.6191,7.5112,1.0319,2.1607,2.5386,2.3954,3.6816,1.0017,2.4166,6.1235,3.3208,0.8267,0.744,0.7876,0.3888,0.0002,7.8535,7.5433,7.9188,3.1172,6.3327,4.3048,1.928,5.8903,2.8541,5.541,0.1127,1.3392,4.9124,7.6636,0.6774,1.5492,1.991,0.0185,0.5521,1.3558,3.8854,0.0469,6.1348,0.5528,2.5078,3.7832,1.3306,1.2787,5.2063,0.6797,1.1561,0.2537,4.355,4.0885,1.182,4.3305,7.232,0.3065,1.9903,0.2366,2.3364,3.7538,1.2316,1.3212,3.4875,1.4954,5.895,0.426,0.6133,1.7973,1.7841,0.8634,4.0928,3.0937,0.5658,0.5083,1.278,0.9998,5.5164,0.4206,5.1071,0.076,2.8741,1.4693,2.9565,2.3089,2.0758,1.0375,5.8757,0.5139,2.9926,0.3391,2.0261,6.9963,1.9156,4.3151,0.2683,4.1896,2.1088,6.0697,0.7014,5.8269,1.7615,7.6441,0.1807,4.1699,0.4239,2.0297,4.7263,0.0339,3.958,0.731,0.3532,1.2709,0.533,0.0002,4.3376,5.9823,0.6417,0.6696,3.9303,4.2471,1.2848,0.1175,0.2311,1.2643,0.3036,5.3348,6.241,0.0501,5.1064,3.56,0.1586,2.6055,0.4408,5.6977,1.2522,4.9026,0.0121,3.8718,1.3494,7.411,5.2161,2.0948,6.8636,2.4932,0.4965,3.941,2.7189,1.5274,0.992,0.8095,0.0065,0.0004,0.0344,0.0181,3.5225,5.1014,2.1898,0.5936,0.0821,4.2643,0.0029,0.782,3.7378,0.1436,0.9643,3.4058,9.4925,0.0088,3.7304,0.644,6.1359,0.736,3.9271,4.0166,4.6982,2.8079,1.339,3.0125,2.8072,1.098,4.0619,0.9043,0.7939,3.8173,2.603,4.9692,4.7266,1.4033,0.0869,7.236,1.9034,0.9493,2.776,2.7755,3.7606,5.525,1.3926,1.1326,1.1188,1.2938,5.2434,3.072,2.2358,2.6435,6.3072,2.3468,0.5192,0.4096,0.0002,5.7159,0.8073,1.4231,3.5483,0.7319,6.6011,4.1879,4.3026,0.0677,6.2662,5.9374,0.921,3.7009,0.2936,0.5483,0.5002,0.0034,1.4258,3.2119,7.4157,1.2044,4.2229,1.5595,5.3269,3.6095,1.7241,8.3132,0.4345,0.0021,0.0005,0.0051,0.0282,6.575,6.7246,5.8043,0.5347,0.0373,0.0886,5.927,4.4166,0.1645,1.0547,3.36,0.0251,2.1601,0.0329,0.2157,2.3021,4.872,4.652,2.536,3.0193,2.9059,2.8804,5.3973,2.6908,1.7809,0.7399,1.5472,0.1983,4.3349,1.7192,4.8473,1.1638,4.2416,5.9579,0.9893,2.191,4.1613,0.8363,2.611,0.9466,5.0818,2.2639,7.9794,0.9673,4.6218,9.7781,6.9467,2.9494,1.5284,6.5566,0.1475,1.3608,1.4049,1.9369,4.1227,3.6331,3.1197,4.1252,0.8941,4.7897,3.1453,2.0743,2.0432,3.7303,0.0098,0.0523,0.3094,2.986,1.6902,2.1726,3.6737,1.2129,0.6537,0.0487,0.3295,0.0001,4.6666,0.0036,6.5735,0.5979,3.2264,2.802,6.4016,0.0108,2.4565,1.8126,3.9651,2.9449,3.1102,5.5132,0.2569,3.0738,6.8065,6.3458,2.3421,4.846,4.0756,10.0486,2.8772,0.5244,5.2897,1.3699,6.1138,1.4265,4.9684,6.435,0.7299,1.1143,2.6125,3.8572,0.4235,1.4406,3.9446,1.8751,5.8598,0.4421,0.0001,1.2757,1.9828,2.2348,3.9362,5.5135,4.8584,2.3056,5.8493,1.9583,0.6515,1.4268,6.3851,2.6868,7.5125,7.6455,9.8584,0.3975,1.2875,8.4873,3.2913,2.786,1.443,0.0043,3.8952,4.0632,2.0459,2.3165,3.214,1.2358,7.0349,1.975,4.8274,3.9997,3.7394,2.4312,3.6019,4.0759,4.2807,2.7061,3.3144,5.2893,2.6192,0.5968]}
{"id":1865,"ended":true,"length":658,"text":"Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Missouri River has been extensively engineered for water transport purposes, and about 32 percent of the river now flows through artificially straightened channels. In the past 60 years, the Missouri River basin has been transformed from a diverse and interconnected ecosystem, including river islands, wetlands, and floodplain forests, into a mono-culture of channelized reservoirs and floodway complexes. A complex system of reservoirs, spillways, diversions, reservoirs and floodways has reduced the flow of water downstream by an estimated 95 percent, and water levels in the upper and middle portions of the Missouri River are now below historical levels.\n\nIn recent years, the Missouri River has been the target of environmental groups concerned with the cumulative effects of the dams and reservoirs. In 1994 Congress directed the Army Corps to conduct a comprehensive study of the biological impacts of the various dams and reservoirs along the upper Missouri River. In 1995 the Corps issued the final report, which indicated that many of the species associated with river islands and floodplain forests have become locally extinct and have been replaced by invasive species. In 1996 the Missouri River Basin Restoration Council (MRBC ), working with the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture, conducted a survey of the river\u2019s riparian areas. Over 900 sites were sampled from the Missouri, Illinois, Colorado, and Dakotas states, and the council has worked with state conservation partners to identify critical restoration needs at selected sites. Under a Memorandum of Agreement entered into in 1998 by the MRBC and the governors of the five watershed states of the Upper River basin, the states agreed to conduct joint water releases that could enhance the ecological health of the upper Missouri River ecosystem. The objective of the agreement was to restore the aquatic ecosystem to a condition comparable to that which existed before the construction of the various river projects associated with the Missouri river system.\n\nThis report provides a summary of the findings from a survey of riparian vegetation and riparian buffers in Missouri. We found that only 16 percent of the sites measured were free of woody plant cover along riparian corridors. We found that 61 percent of the sites measured were covered at least 10 percent by water oak (Quercus floridana ). We found that 44 percent of the sites measured were covered at least 10 percent by water hemp (Chenopodium album ). Only six of the sites measured were free of water hemp or water oak and they were all on the Platte and Missouri valleys. Based on an examination of water samples taken from the sample sites, we found that a majority of the sample sites were low or failing in chlorophyll concentrations. This is evidence that many of these sites are suffering from the negative impacts of nitrogen in the watershed.\n\nThe results of our survey show that the nutrient and pollution problems affecting aquatic systems in the upper Missouri River are not unique to the Missouri, but are pervasive along entire riparian ecosystems in the central United States. The MRBC\u2019s Restoration and Monitoring Program provides watershed protection and restoration efforts in Nebraska, Iowa, and North Dakota. The MRBC is also providing assistance to the states of South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming in their efforts to restore their riparian ecosystems.

{"id":3520,"ended":false,"length":647,"text":"As the war drew to a close in April 1865, Greeley and the Tribune urged magnanimity towards the defeated Confederates, arguing that making martyrs of Confederate leaders would only inspire future rebels.\n\nThe Tribune praised Union generals for \"the dignified consideration given to Southern prisoners, regardless of rank or creed, and the absolute confidence of their conduct... The Government of the United States is too humane to allow a single prisoner to be placed in the power of the enemy.\" The Union government had \"the power, if it chooses, to hang every one [the Confederate leaders] and to make an example and a warning.\"\n\nOn one occasion, Greeley wrote two harsh letters about General Stonewall Jackson, but later softened his tone. The last words printed in the edition of the Tribune on April 27, 1865, described the battle of Cold Harbor as \"a decisive military defeat for the South.\" Only a few days remained before Washington surrendered to Union forces. Even in defeat, the Confederate government and its leaders had been treated with consideration by the Union.\n\nThe closing of the war also signalled an ending of the war with the Indian tribes. Throughout the war, Greeley had been pressing negotiations and treaties to end the fighting and secure a peaceful future for the tribe.\n\nOn April 9, 1864, Greeley sent a letter to Salmon P. Chase, the secretary of the treasury, offering to mediate between the president and the Dakota Chief Red Cloud. \"The tribe... want to end this war and I have no doubt but that many of the band are very anxious that the Indian war should at once be at an end,\" Greeley wrote. Three days later, the U.S. Army agreed to end the Indian War and to hold elections in the Dakota Agency. Three treaties were signed over the next few months, two promising peace and an end to the Dakota hostilities, and the third formally ending the military presence.\n\nFinally, Greeley made peace with the Mormon community. Greeley's letters to Mormon leaders, which were frequently published along with the editorials, had been harshly critical of the Church and its leader Brigham Young. But the editors of the Tribune now urged magnanimity towards Young.\n\nThe Mormon Church, through its local church leaders, had agreed to cease proselytizing and to allow federal forces to control territory disputed with the Church. After this, the Church submitted to federal supervision, and a new generation of leaders emerged. In a short period of time, Young himself had been exiled and died.\n\nThe Tribune's editorials also took on an increasingly positive tone. The newspaper, Greeley wrote on April 14, 1865, \"must speak of the last days in the land as being the happiest that ever existed since the creation.\" In another issue of the newspaper dated two weeks later, Greeley's editorial encouraged the government to treat former Confederate prison guards as heroes.

{"id":1579,"ended":true,"length":621,"text":"A tropical wave that moved off the northwest coast of Africa on July 4 passed through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave moved across Central America into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on July 30. The wave produced scattered heavy rainfall and gusty winds over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, causing flooding and a few minor river flooding in southwestern Louisiana, the eastern Texas panhandle, and southern Alabama. At the same time, the system produced heavy rainfall across southern Louisiana and extreme southern Mississippi. Rainfall totals of 8-15 inches are possible across portions of southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi through the evening.\n\nThe low pressure system brought scattered showers and thunderstorms to much of Florida on July 30 and 31. The most notable rainfall was across the central and southern Panhandle where 2-3 inches fell. The low then moved across the peninsula and out over the Atlantic Ocean on August 1.\n\nHurricane Laura remained a strong category 3 hurricane as it approached Southwest Louisiana on August 2. The system moved ashore in Cameron Parish shortly after 11:00 pm with maximum sustained winds near 120 mph. Landfall winds were reported as high as 125 mph near Cameron, LA. A few tornadoes were also reported. Laura caused severe damage and destroyed much of Lake Charles, LA. Over 900,000 homes and businesses were without power across numerous parishes as well. Most of Louisiana was declared a federal disaster area.\n\nLaura quickly weakened back to a minimum category 1 hurricane on August 3 and entered Louisiana as a strong category 2 hurricane. Rainfall totals from Tropical Storm Laura were widespread across Louisiana and Arkansas with the heaviest rain along the Mississippi-Louisiana-Arkansas (MLA) region. Flooding was widespread across the region with some river flooding of moderate to major proportions. Overland flooding was more common than river flooding, but most of Louisiana was under river flood warnings to severe flood warnings.\n\nTropical Storm Marco passed just east of the MPT, but the associated storm bands produced numerous severe thunderstorms for the area. Many stations reported gusts near 60 mph.\n\nThe low pressure system moved into the Mississippi River delta on August 3 and weakened to a depression. The depression moved through Missouri and Illinois, bringing heavy rainfall. A few tornadoes were reported.\n\nTropical Storm Nate was an extremely fast and intense storm, moving quickly east over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The system developed a closed circulation and rapidly developed a large, well-defined spiral band, which caused an area of tropical-storm-force winds and rainbands to expand out to 200 miles (320 km) or more. By 11 am central, the circulation became extremely strong and the central pressure briefly dropped to about 999 mb (29.92 inches of mercury). Nate produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds across portions of eastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and southeast Alabama. Rainfall was generally lighter in western portions of the area. The storm also produced a few tornadoes.\n\nA tropical wave over the northwestern Caribbean Sea drifted into the eastern Gulf of Mexico on July 29. The wave crossed the Gulf of Mexico without significant development. However, the system produced scattered showers and thunderstorms over the western Gulf Coast on July 30 and 31.\n\nTropical Storms Paulette and Rene formed from a decaying extratropical cyclone. Both were short-lived with Paulette becoming extratropical on July 28 and Rene becoming extratropical on August 1.","token_len":704,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,2.5886,4.6741,5.1053,0.6297,5.883,0.1267,0.1427,3.4275,2.371,4.0292,3.0973,6.6566,1.2027,1.3164,5.1817,0.4351,1.8082,8.3086,3.1192,5.617,5.8442,7.2497,0.9716,1.9042,2.624,3.91,4.0455,5.9538,0.8066,4.8177,0.9876,6.1088,4.4241,0.1693,0.0458,1.332,0.6021,5.8404,1.0328,1.8297,1.8607,6.7314,6.7886,5.0533,1.75,1.8678,6.0547,0.2147,0.1004,3.8579,1.0655,4.5761,3.3514,0.4719,0.0265,1.7384,3.0418,2.3892,1.2627,4.0285,4.4507,2.1572,7.1127,2.4566,2.0441,5.6529,3.995,2.4654,2.6502,4.2837,5.1484,6.1416,0.0002,0.8267,0.2745,3.3925,4.0439,0.2038,4.5068,1.5487,1.1163,0.0037,0.0781,0.8411,7.8183,4.6264,3.8993,1.3785,2.3551,2.9555,2.6001,1.0873,9.4629,7.8638,5.592,0.9923,7.0673,0.2982,2.9656,2.7648,4.4552,3.3199,2.8123,0.6644,4.4245,2.4642,4.091,4.378,0.0009,2.7593,0.8445,1.121,2.984,0.3628,5.4399,1.639,4.0086,2.0357,1.1081,0.0007,1.6293,6.0834,2.1909,1.5828,5.6304,7.4214,3.7735,1.1631,2.7849,0.0242,2.1933,4.3926,0.0094,5.2184,2.0753,0.5607,2.5016,1.8967,3.7968,0.5884,1.4288,5.5691,3.5369,1.9657,1.4865,5.8577,0.8267,3.1908,1.266,1.3799,7.5723,0.0034,5.3745,5.7575,1.3656,0.8685,0.0667,4.68,2.0855,1.6263,2.6633,11.4022,2.1944,3.391,0.6728,6.2844,1.5463,5.0435,3.3966,0.8861,3.5276,0.7013,2.946,2.17,1.8038,0.8364,1.7058,0.0002,3.9527,0.127,9.4284,7.0886,3.7378,3.1682,5.1287,2.1071,0.5677,4.4178,1.242,4.3224,7.6519,3.0386,0.5994,0.7175,2.0662,0.4216,1.21,3.7937,2.1992,5.5354,1.6228,10.6631,2.5856,7.5539,0.4775,4.8097,1.292,1.6813,2.1832,4.0701,4.8464,0.2049,0.0516,5.9167,3.6919,0.338,0.613,7.6828,2.2707,5.991,1.6546,2.9981,3.3515,1.0543,0.0157,3.593,0.0665,4.5892,2.7474,2.2098,7.7532,0.68,3.955,3.8263,6.2567,0.091,1.2385,2.863,0.56,2.2466,3.8651,4.629,3.5988,2.3355,3.3915,3.2414,4.156,0.0447,5.8134,2.8553,1.5041,4.8053,0.702,5.9542,6.3655,3.2045,0.0085,2.6363,2.0021,0.2526,0.216,4.3252,0.0608,5.1197,6.7503,8.1894,0.0047,4.2839,2.9817,3.306,5.44,0.9347,4.5311,1.2846,5.5958,2.5005,5.5977,0.4591,1.5219,1.1889,0.6283,0.0002,5.9774,6.6515,4.3187,6.461,1.3453,2.4695,5.6721,5.7168,2.4394,0.3141,2.0744,0.4703,1.3321,2.233,5.806,4.488,2.4403,0.8591,4.9791,1.305,1.1166,0.3114,1.0712,7.9103,0.837,0.236,4.424,6.5967,0.1037,2.8798,1.3424,7.0033,1.0586,2.7845,1.3614,5.9872,3.9052,3.3075,2.4102,2.1234,6.5499,0.3005,3.5532,5.2076,1.2707,0.0052,3.0859,1.5694,0.0001,6.1829,5.7043,3.2592,0.1105,4.6027,0.6368,4.2962,0.6223,2.16,2.8984,1.4247,1.0982,3.7861,1.7002,3.1111,6.0874,0.2491,4.9826,6.7414,0.9859,6.1593,1.2672,0.5158,4.9956,5.8444,0.5272,1.5586,5.6044,1.107,2.3646,3.3561,0.1034,2.7471,1.7494,4.2933,0.6991,2.7709,0.8616,3.5616,8.0408,1.7821,3.9132,5.5156,7.3725,3.3169,2.0725,0.5231,1.0204,0.0002,5.0799,0.345,0.013,0.1158,9.06,3.8661,6.5858,4.0923,0.023,1.3024,10.5339,3.9232,3.4045,3.5482,2.9238,9.4117,1.9397,8.6514,6.0386,4.8686,3.6074,2.2157,0.0858,5.135,1.4602,2.4239,0.5897,5.7919,7.6624,2.2465,6.2115,0.5343,5.3079,3.1115,0.1573,1.4987,2.3363,0.0003,1.782,4.2589,0.1069,0.0462,3.4155,3.1397,1.0004,4.9744,1.8093,5.9922,1.4754,0.3381,1.6596,1.2799,5.6547,1.8725,0.4368,9.1851,2.0434,1.0413,5.7631,2.6668,3.6091,7.188,1.2134,5.0134,1.7807,4.2118,1.6025,0.8761,2.3649,3.5761,1.8673,2.2397,0.0091,0.3697,0.5608,1.4871,1.5369,0.0002,2.7989,0.0228,0.0036,0.1346,7.7755,2.8408,4.0601,2.8896,5.7818,3.1252,3.2098,1.7905,2.8306,2.6075,5.1714,3.5354,3.8586,0.8936,3.0236,2.137,0.1528,0.0492,1.5346,1.0973,0.4981,6.283,2.2133,9.3332,6.2869,2.596,5.5613,4.1915,1.3434,3.3358,3.3585,4.8123,0.4152,2.8543,10.0067,6.1924,3.0761,2.1943,4.3659,4.8299,3.4741,0.7367,5.2677,5.2513,1.3262,2.0181,3.0269,0.5976,2.9369,3.5633,10.324,1.045,6.0422,4.4134,2.1069,6.5023,0.446,2.9156,3.0178,0.7336,0.4161,5.1227,0.248,0.7714,5.3106,5.5002,2.6017,9.4432,4.9424,0.8297,6.3283,4.8943,3.7939,2.6014,0.8628,1.8495,5.4171,5.11,8.077,3.0312,0.6704,3.1607,11.7314,4.5692,0.6705,0.7139,5.9173,1.8672,6.5563,2.1953,7.7898,3.4956,0.6619,4.7642,4.6975,2.357,0.9038,1.9946,3.1505,0.1072,0.0712,2.3604,4.1665,0.0027,3.324,1.2967,1.3407,2.5979,0.7232,0.1744,0.7971,3.9052,1.8255,0.3921,5.6357,0.1845,3.795,5.6829,6.6132,1.662,3.988,3.5891,0.1583,0.8823,3.5562,1.2025,2.6027,2.9939,2.7854,1.7557,2.584,2.7781,1.9948,0.0184,1.0308,0.3507,0.0002,3.598,2.012,3.6593,5.3544,0.7759,5.0616,4.3605,4.6218,5.4608,2.7503,0.7788,2.5057,1.5172,0.0951,0.0645,0.2861,2.755,2.2522,0.5772,0.8354,1.9478,5.5865,0.701,2.6256,0.2699,0.2837,6.2878,0.8,0.4831,1.0433,4.4949,0.0475,1.3144,1.0122,1.8743,4.2989,3.4095,0.1933,0.3535,0.0123,2.254,0.7238,2.6251,1.7961,3.4396,1.9475,0.3827,0.5235,0.9539,0.2491,0.3551,1.8719,0.0002,2.5912,0.0261,0.0027,0.2373,7.4537,12.676,1.6725,2.6748,6.2141,4.1121,4.9198,4.0102,1.8498,11.5865,9.8822,0.1087,0.0043,0.0156,3.5885,0.0326,2.5639,3.6702,1.952,6.3154,0.3536,0.0179,2.9441,11.5122,0.0005,4.3763,10.2965,0.001,0.0015,0.1084,2.1741,0.6611,2.4594,0.8617,0.3724,0.0003,0.5377,0.9075,0.0034,0.0001,0.0017,0.1139,2.138,1.4526,0.1627]}
{"id":4200,"ended":true,"length":666,"text":"On March 5, 2009, the NTSB issued its report and findings. It states that the plane crashed at an elevation of about 10 @, @ 000 feet ( 3 @, 006 meters ) when the pilot turned south. The report goes on to state \" The airplane was destroyed at the point of contact with the ground. \" There are no survivors, the pilot is only identified \"A.J.\" (an airplane identification number). The report notes that the pilot lost the ability to control the aircraft, and it did nothing to prevent the stall. There are no witnesses and little evidence to tell the story of what happened. The pilots last recorded communication occurred only two minutes before he disappeared from the air traffic control tower. The plane that was registered to A.J. was a private aircraft. The plane was owned by \"David R. Taylor, \" and it had a \"tail number\" of N821VT.The plane was a Cirrus SR20 and was on the market by and had purchased in 2004. The plane was owned by a company in Virginia. The plane was also operated by an aircraft that was also owned in Virginia. The plane was operated by A.J. and operated and insured by a \"David R. Taylor.\" The NTSB report reveals that A.J. flew the plane the day before he disappeared and was in good condition. A. J. had 10 hours of flight time at the time of the flight. He was a very experienced pilot and had accumulated over 2,500 hours flying time.\n\nThe NTSB report of the incident reveals very little evidence which can be used to determine the cause of the collision. NTSB states that the aircraft experienced \"a loss of airspeed and an abnormal descent rate, \" and that A.J. made no evasive action either before or after he lost control of the airplane. The NTSB goes on to state that \" the airplane had no record of flight controls malfunction or failure prior to the accident flight.\" The planes throttle was open and it was flying at a constant speed of about 100 @, and the rudder and spoilers were in an inverted position. The pilot said that in the last two minutes of the conversation he had with air traffic control, he was trying to communicate through his radio.\n\nThe plane crash was approximately 9 miles northwest of the airport at the northern end of Long Island. The air traffic recordings reveal that after A.J. turned south, he made no sounds or any other type of warning or alert and he never reported any problems or difficulties with the plane.\n\nThe report also states \" the airplane was destroyed at the point of contact with the ground.\" According to witnesses there was an explosion which they heard. On the ground the airplane was lying on its top end facing north east. When the emergency services arrived \"The only thing they were going to find was a big pile of burning wreckage.\" One of the investigators noted that this case was very similar to an incident in which a plane crashed in Georgia, and his comments caused an uproar. As an example he discussed the case of a pilot who lost control over his plane, and the pilot was able to call in and make several phone calls before the plane crashed.\n\nThe investigation into the cause of the crash was called \"NTSB Special Airworthiness Investigation\" and was completed on March 13, 2009. After the release of the report the government of India and the United States revoked the license to fly of the pilot.","token_len":705,"entropy":[7.4705,3.3679,0.2449,4.2562,0.2375,1.7719,8.2197,0.012,1.704,2.1251,2.4229,4.4625,5.9661,2.4061,2.388,4.0229,0.5871,1.5084,5.8295,3.1367,2.4528,3.7106,4.6658,0.1037,2.7879,3.9413,14.5001,6.2739,7.8357,10.7446,1.2034,2.8282,7.6226,5.9041,1.4853,5.1695,3.3976,1.7572,2.2282,4.4496,1.4337,1.5392,4.7807,5.5473,2.101,1.0439,4.5526,4.7019,0.06,0.0178,1.0477,4.4984,6.3644,3.1964,1.3879,5.6652,3.0001,1.9343,4.1892,0.6245,4.6558,1.3687,0.5748,1.2842,1.767,2.7563,4.433,1.5093,1.7216,4.643,2.415,3.1633,2.4731,2.7072,6.5475,2.1878,6.2166,9.0248,4.9646,3.2257,1.658,3.2838,6.4144,6.0995,5.0384,0.2103,2.2737,1.3811,2.3388,3.8113,0.3656,1.1281,1.4695,5.4215,4.634,3.249,0.017,3.1985,0.8761,1.4387,2.1262,1.6744,3.9791,5.5876,6.198,0.151,1.6309,0.7544,7.8775,0.7068,3.7042,1.3264,0.664,4.0881,3.6283,6.265,1.4963,1.0075,7.8028,0.6331,1.1288,0.6327,1.7931,0.2481,0.9707,1.301,5.4758,9.0788,4.9733,6.0406,6.4486,6.1754,2.5589,2.3188,1.6101,5.7929,2.7301,2.7781,1.1356,3.0552,7.0045,0.0943,0.6878,0.6653,1.4054,2.9919,4.6994,1.7883,6.7188,0.3337,4.1007,0.0285,0.0787,0.121,1.7234,2.9984,4.201,2.3175,1.4999,1.2855,3.2213,1.1128,3.2034,0.1229,5.2972,6.6838,4.5572,0.445,6.1668,2.0499,4.8662,1.9034,3.2521,2.6341,1.9454,3.4608,8.1774,1.7695,0.6971,1.7827,4.6311,4.23,5.4299,10.9797,1.5948,5.637,3.4328,1.0459,3.3987,9.4191,0.0128,6.6777,5.3833,3.4146,1.2284,4.9203,1.4876,3.7493,4.7948,8.1543,7.4589,6.2601,2.7217,4.2017,1.1445,1.2952,2.4079,0.747,3.5002,0.0536,3.0081,2.479,4.3992,4.2914,1.7156,1.1852,2.5327,0.6209,4.0445,3.9507,0.0856,3.3919,3.7146,4.8044,0.9871,4.141,1.3626,5.1899,0.5789,0.5216,1.085,2.1472,0.5374,3.4863,0.157,4.1319,0.3202,0.2646,0.085,2.5711,5.4687,7.1421,3.7961,0.183,2.1303,4.2678,5.82,0.597,0.0741,0.0354,3.3891,1.14,4.4706,0.0026,2.14,6.4099,0.4469,2.1996,0.0073,0.0038,0.0567,5.4569,1.0055,0.8074,5.9346,1.7131,0.985,1.7205,0.6789,2.2209,2.7903,2.9383,4.7906,1.3349,0.8119,2.5031,0.2541,8.5318,0.0505,2.21,7.4093,3.1548,0.7518,2.3645,0.8632,3.796,1.5633,0.2807,0.2357,0.73,5.0002,0.7105,1.7037,1.0183,3.6502,4.65,1.5147,0.1882,1.1503,1.6889,6.4499,2.649,3.757,0.4593,1.8448,0.2921,2.8583,4.5277,0.9102,5.052,0.0019,2.37,1.0498,0.0047,1.3131,6.0753,1.6427,3.2865,5.2,6.3234,0.2554,2.9284,5.7378,2.6637,0.9603,1.9595,0.3372,3.0134,1.311,0.4782,0.1226,0.6064,5.0752,0.4747,7.495,0.006,5.5841,0.6506,1.0804,2.6934,6.0198,2.0375,2.7821,4.8763,0.1716,4.4067,0.808,2.0973,3.2053,4.0518,4.0982,2.4594,2.8841,4.5017,1.5175,1.0257,3.3915,0.0037,0.0251,0.0487,5.097,1.2292,8.8267,0.0066,2.6216,7.2019,3.5503,0.2593,0.2177,2.0822,2.8203,0.2831,0.4984,0.0644,2.0128,0.2964,1.0706,0.913,0.0043,6.2232,0.0293,0.0139,0.3706,0.6697,1.7669,3.7009,1.5904,2.6443,1.8031,5.9362,0.1709,4.8076,5.0117,5.755,1.9206,2.5697,4.4711,0.0036,0.7631,2.1033,10.7751,2.5592,1.0401,6.2622,10.9344,4.2595,6.5362,1.2916,4.2661,0.8083,7.4881,0.6852,1.0707,3.2414,0.9732,2.1302,1.8502,3.4442,7.3571,0.9703,3.4085,1.3098,5.2505,0.0003,3.501,7.3847,0.4763,3.2827,4.1157,3.5305,0.3175,0.3595,0.8141,2.502,5.0824,1.1612,5.1609,1.0217,3.346,2.7649,0.9696,0.7008,0.4979,6.2512,1.1313,1.8743,3.4619,7.7625,0.0805,0.2899,1.2251,0.981,2.1811,3.9709,0.03,4.0044,5.1984,2.1858,1.751,1.213,3.0352,0.0002,0.9109,3.2838,5.4577,2.0057,8.1744,3.535,2.6982,3.2089,0.0241,2.6737,3.3559,2.1188,2.4091,6.1078,0.8194,0.0102,5.0647,0.6183,1.1242,1.0128,4.7401,0.3398,11.8543,5.4751,0.4577,4.7825,3.5186,0.003,0.0152,0.0959,2.6189,1.434,1.1487,1.2526,3.2416,1.6732,7.4094,1.9221,2.8966,2.3449,4.8027,0.0119,6.2002,2.5894,5.7285,4.2914,3.3591,4.6786,4.9265,1.0101,3.2425,2.3509,4.6956,1.8282,0.5628,2.3231,0.3118,2.0597,0.0002,1.0902,3.6185,2.3787,0.7259,3.265,3.3684,1.9292,1.0764,4.312,1.0753,0.0435,0.0556,0.0013,0.0031,0.0026,0.0021,0.0031,1.8746,4.6046,0.002,7.3587,4.1915,1.0251,3.7129,2.787,4.1097,7.7123,6.1219,3.4731,5.6452,1.6533,2.3032,2.1647,2.8,0.7148,6.3639,0.6137,1.1698,7.1487,6.2811,4.924,3.2729,5.8009,1.0176,3.9311,1.0141,5.9514,3.3353,0.6048,6.3596,5.1895,6.5604,2.2102,3.6484,3.8629,4.8033,0.0243,3.2502,0.4979,1.4133,4.9824,2.2703,0.0763,5.3203,1.9281,2.0706,4.3467,2.6647,0.1027,3.9949,4.6379,0.359,4.434,7.0531,1.3293,2.9711,2.0738,0.1354,4.353,2.7924,1.2784,1.4354,1.0006,2.4754,1.7794,1.5801,5.1867,2.8614,2.1234,5.7481,5.204,5.53,3.5933,1.6957,1.4605,5.0628,3.793,2.1023,3.6155,6.393,1.0508,3.6241,1.2331,1.1598,3.9862,0.8936,2.3784,0.2768,5.0292,1.7908,1.624,2.4798,0.901,2.1691,3.5692,2.5101,4.5614,0.0045,4.3562,3.2351,4.7374,4.4089,5.4524,4.4011,0.0152,4.3986,1.1723,1.099,0.8485,0.2813,1.4474,0.0002,0.9887,4.2263,2.1395,0.301,2.8161,0.0428,0.1177,0.4204,1.9927,6.0086,4.4081,5.5285,2.8413,0.0738,5.2287,6.2575,1.8873,0.6736,2.7383,1.5775,2.5966,2.3702,1.4241,1.4511,3.9356,0.0682,0.3471,0.251,4.6032,1.5133,6.2374,0.0607,0.2294,1.2204,1.8165,5.78,1.1651,6.5889,3.1173,0.8012,3.0867,0.1982,6.8119,0.577,2.3708,2.9314,2.2537,5.9661,0.8468,5.187,1.8784]}
{"id":1615,"ended":true,"length":637,"text":"After the 1920 season, Barrow resigned from the Red Sox to become the business manager of the Yankees, replacing the deceased Harry Sparrow. He took control of building the roster, which included the signing of Babe Ruth as a free agent, who had been playing semi-professional baseball in Louisville, Kentucky, and Joe DiMaggio, who had been out of the major leagues since 1918, when he walked away to fight in World War I. The signings drew great controversy from the Red Sox and their fans, and both Ruth and DiMaggio were booed during the season opening game on April 4, 1921, at Fenway Park. In early October, Barrow traded away Ruth and DiMaggio to the Boston Red Sox for Wally Pipp and Tommy Heinsohn, who replaced Ruth as the team's first baseman. The Red Sox claimed Ruth as a free agent, which Barrow fought a lengthy legal case to prevent.\n\nBarre was in his first year managing the Red Sox and was in the middle of a dispute with the owner, James Doaks. The incident occurred on Opening Day, when Pipp took exception to being called a bench player and struck Doaks, who had to be held back by team president Eddie Collins and second baseman Tris Speaker.\n\nBarre managed the Red Sox for eight seasons and was widely regarded as the best baseball executive of the 1920s. Barrow managed the Red Sox through the 1926 season, when he resigned on October 11, after the Red Sox finished with a 69\u201397 record. During his tenure, Barrow acquired Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Lou Gehrig Jr., Eddie Collins, and Tris Speaker. He also developed George Herman Ruth Jr., who was the youngest player in professional baseball at the time.\n\nBarre left the American League to become the President of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1927 to 1935. He was instrumental in the signing of several players, including Bob Friend, Eddie Brinkman, and Lefty Gomez. He resigned from the Pirates in 1935 to accept a position as a Commissioner of Baseball.[1] He returned to the Boston area upon his retirement and was active in the amateur circuit until his death on October 1, 1950 at the age of 69.[2]\n\nBarre was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum as a builder in 1964. Prior to the 1965 season, Barrow was part of a consortium of investors that purchased the New York Yankees from Jacob Ruppert and Charles Comiskey after Ruppert and Comiskey defaulted on their loans with the team. Barrow became team president on January 11, 1966 for 18 years and helped create the Yankees' new stadium, Yankee Stadium, after their old stadium, Ebbets Field, was demolished. In 1974 he became a Commissioner with two more years remaining in his 18 years as team president, which was an honor that was denied him the day after he was elected an American League life member in 1965.[3]\n\n^Barre resigned from the team in October 1925. Prior to resigning, he was offered a five-year contract that would have paid him $60,000 a year, double what he earned as the team's manager and general manager. However, he was convinced by some members of the team that this would give him too much control over the roster, and instead, he negotiated a three-year deal and a clause that would allow him to resign anytime he wanted.","token_len":705,"entropy":[2.3183,9.7405,5.8418,0.3807,8.056,2.934,7.6501,1.2934,0.6478,5.2142,0.9482,2.6501,1.1832,1.1517,9.0873,1.3878,0.6849,0.6156,4.1085,1.8531,4.6674,3.2261,7.1163,7.3135,11.1234,1.063,2.2605,3.9601,3.3799,0.0626,9.8744,2.0673,8.3359,1.4337,2.4837,1.0841,1.9256,7.2712,0.022,3.0047,0.0035,4.1393,1.3644,0.4605,0.0045,1.7111,5.2143,3.0307,1.6765,4.7692,8.3142,0.0209,2.4746,0.2469,1.8789,7.2743,1.1125,0.7627,1.3729,2.1645,5.3425,2.0232,0.0133,0.0023,0.002,1.7661,0.8261,0.8622,1.1171,6.3351,0.2164,0.9154,3.6782,0.0664,2.0184,5.475,2.2998,3.6093,0.244,6.7437,1.3747,4.0049,6.2495,1.4767,0.6802,0.0084,0.6692,0.1772,2.3658,7.4486,6.592,4.7389,3.9416,2.7161,1.226,4.4864,0.0038,1.8456,3.6232,0.7621,0.5214,1.7414,5.1099,7.0042,0.0441,0.1907,0.0014,0.0003,0.0005,0.8715,5.7211,0.0002,3.1754,0.6089,2.8182,9.853,2.5799,4.8238,1.8341,3.332,0.7485,2.0675,1.2688,2.611,1.1179,0.0002,0.0388,0.2982,2.8557,5.3336,4.619,0.4438,2.92,0.0019,6.8583,2.3954,3.3681,1.4922,1.2838,0.002,0.0005,0.0013,1.4036,0.5869,3.2017,0.4035,0.0041,0.7892,8.9715,4.4776,4.2925,5.0929,5.7698,4.9545,0.065,0.0168,0.8469,1.4024,6.5334,3.7102,1.6584,1.4378,1.2536,0.084,2.9751,0.4252,0.4009,2.1036,1.2692,0.0002,5.3238,2.6495,2.1809,2.2516,0.5731,0.0054,1.8788,3.6774,3.8013,0.0021,8.6442,5.2144,4.9915,2.5515,5.3838,2.0181,3.9047,0.7708,2.0915,0.0032,4.3583,2.6661,2.5729,4.485,2.0606,2.5238,1.3425,5.889,0.4292,1.1248,0.0003,2.4983,2.015,3.7655,1.6176,3.0334,0.015,1.4496,6.8375,0.2579,1.6918,3.8904,1.1571,4.6515,7.4584,8.6013,1.4415,2.3397,6.3133,3.1051,1.6982,6.7445,0.0325,1.0724,1.9136,4.2428,0.008,3.7612,7.7079,0.0676,4.606,2.0676,1.6695,8.1162,1.1405,1.962,6.3776,2.1033,0.0075,3.3423,0.9007,1.9373,5.9598,1.5029,4.1898,3.3053,1.1757,5.8065,1.5053,6.5867,5.612,3.2943,6.6134,0.277,7.8657,4.938,0.8526,0.5407,3.7222,0.0002,2.4291,0.0012,6.5082,0.9939,1.2787,0.0002,1.2581,3.4774,0.7799,1.993,1.8534,6.6008,1.525,0.0638,1.2476,1.3677,3.4368,2.7473,1.6071,1.3732,2.4553,0.1021,0.4607,3.8228,0.0025,6.2161,1.1203,2.4678,0.0003,3.7734,1.0502,4.9511,0.1641,0.8401,2.2881,0.6357,6.2658,5.0813,4.2492,3.5084,0.4666,4.0559,2.0543,1.4806,0.0004,3.8382,3.3663,0.7479,7.2727,3.6784,6.257,0.1018,0.8043,3.804,1.1206,1.2056,0.5375,0.761,0.001,5.7888,3.5045,0.0031,1.1479,4.3579,0.0615,0.0,0.2034,3.4551,0.0695,0.0,2.4262,0.0405,6.1086,1.364,0.2354,1.6038,3.974,0.0021,0.0105,1.2174,2.2301,1.1294,5.7799,6.075,8.1842,9.3418,4.2296,0.3773,1.3687,1.4606,1.9644,4.2782,1.0381,1.8683,5.6095,0.4345,5.1172,0.8425,0.0512,0.7391,0.8067,0.0002,1.9472,0.0023,4.2162,0.3999,7.1536,0.158,3.0296,1.6803,1.0189,5.6026,0.1756,0.5236,5.6303,0.5479,4.3202,3.6631,0.7575,3.4747,0.6638,0.7726,1.5137,5.0751,0.0262,1.3907,4.4799,0.0152,5.5098,1.9781,1.403,0.2535,4.8888,9.5984,0.5056,5.4663,8.1261,3.1138,3.0255,0.0718,1.2355,10.688,0.0709,5.7287,0.4512,1.2639,7.1708,1.2339,0.252,0.7293,0.6897,3.0579,1.8253,7.1045,0.8511,1.847,0.9231,2.614,6.7954,1.0163,0.9931,6.9929,1.4884,0.0645,2.1465,3.7075,0.1166,0.3553,4.4716,3.2209,8.6016,0.7503,1.0252,3.0713,2.0321,5.1017,0.2113,0.8503,6.1596,3.7528,2.6057,1.2057,1.1639,1.7348,2.4415,3.238,0.0232,5.6806,3.1066,0.7752,0.0154,0.0036,3.9133,1.7134,0.1503,0.0453,0.3289,0.0002,1.8223,0.0043,1.2333,1.9456,0.0011,0.0519,0.0199,2.7227,0.1869,0.0008,0.0023,0.0016,4.9591,4.8555,5.0274,1.0567,12.4369,1.6355,4.364,0.6424,4.8971,0.0019,2.5649,5.7615,0.0936,0.121,1.7305,0.0034,1.2771,5.0296,0.005,2.2807,5.734,0.6291,4.0083,1.9204,2.3496,0.8888,2.9963,0.252,0.7292,1.5167,9.759,5.0555,3.1694,2.5755,2.0921,3.7053,8.0162,2.9464,0.0394,5.3275,4.0581,0.0012,0.0011,2.5548,0.086,0.0006,0.0005,7.983,0.0006,0.0755,0.9819,2.7237,5.4717,0.6043,2.7693,0.8046,3.1824,0.0018,3.6928,7.9026,0.1949,3.0653,2.8429,3.3908,0.0126,1.0929,6.4315,7.9037,0.8621,1.7297,5.8372,3.8117,0.3874,2.3178,2.926,2.7844,1.6614,1.3859,1.8208,0.0078,0.7301,4.6229,5.5169,7.9981,2.0396,2.0759,7.4373,0.4554,0.2019,0.0254,0.0812,0.3713,2.4097,1.2632,2.7644,3.9107,2.8224,1.8501,2.2823,5.2624,3.6006,6.6551,2.1191,0.8841,1.7887,1.4609,1.2637,7.1635,3.5173,1.8006,3.4114,0.082,1.8407,3.4109,2.1599,4.4798,2.8773,2.2233,2.4685,7.2473,1.3821,4.5519,3.7975,0.974,1.48,2.1455,2.151,7.4334,3.0152,0.3021,15.7274,1.3697,1.9311,5.0154,1.9468,0.081,0.043,0.4703,0.0001,9.7423,5.2431,0.0492,7.3586,0.652,0.1547,4.0196,1.0253,4.0511,7.521,1.8793,6.5063,0.0018,5.5655,0.0024,0.5443,0.6047,1.2485,6.328,0.7723,3.6945,0.0475,0.0113,0.6996,3.5194,1.207,1.9386,1.7912,0.0727,0.3671,4.9034,0.5367,0.0592,2.2015,0.4018,1.6775,7.5807,2.2647,0.6274,2.5279,2.1484,2.3817,1.1347,0.4324,2.6037,2.6333,4.1093,0.0079,1.0269,2.7606,0.0208,1.7221,1.6961,5.626,1.6919,4.9303,3.5301,0.0625,0.1936,1.4517,0.703,3.3128,1.9287,4.8555,0.4184,3.8826,0.0748,2.9163,0.6295,0.3295,4.9441,1.2774,1.1177,4.0182,3.0256,0.816,4.2043,0.5845,2.3346,0.03,0.058,1.3341,4.5623,2.9084,8.252,0.7942,1.0305,1.8635,0.2135,0.1257,4.8785,5.7609,1.0478,0.991,0.7332]}
{"id":4420,"ended":true,"length":649,"text":"Apart from the preface and Francatelli's advice on serving wine, the body of the book consists almost entirely of recipes without any kind of introduction. There is no guidance on choice of ingredients, equipment, cooking procedures or recipes. Although some of them are fairly easy to interpret, the book offers no information, other than a few photographs, on food-handling safety.\n\nIn spite of Francatelli's assurance that \" every recipe is so simple that not a child can fail to understand it,\" many of the recipes, in fact, make no sense. For example, the author suggests serving six courses of meatloaf with \" four slices of bread spread with butter, salt, pepper and honey \" on each course. Not only is the meal very expensive... but who on earth would not turn up his nose at such an elaborate lunch?\n\nOf far greater importance are some of the recipes which make no sense when we try to use simple ingredients or equipment. For example, \" Put in a frying pan one pound of sliced sausage and let it brown in the frying pan for forty minutes, \" followed by the statement that \" you can eat or give away the meat.\" So all meatloaf in the United States is thrown away?!\n\nAnother example : \" Put in a pot one pound of dried prunes and pour in a cup of strong coffee. Heat it up and pour in a quart of water, \" followed by the statement that \" you can eat both the dried prunes and the water.\" Are we to understand that for many of the other recipes, as well, only one course at a time and that the cooked food is served in large volumes to be given away or simply thrown away?\n\nAt the conclusion of the book, the author offers a number of anecdotes illustrating the ways in which he and his acquaintances have celebrated Christmas at home, and at a few restaurants. While there are several amusing anecdotes, there is nothing instructive or instructive about the book.\n\nSince the purpose of this book is to acquaint us with ways of celebrating Christmas in Italian homes, it is disappointing to find no instructions on Christmas traditions. The book includes only one section on Christmas cookies. It is entitled \" Italian cookies,\" but what are they? Does the word \" cookies\" in the title actually refer to cookies? Or, since there is an extensive discussion on cake making followed by a single reference to cookies, does this mean that Italian cookies are a completely different matter?\n\nWhat is especially disappointing after reading Francatelli's book in a store is to find it so incomplete or unavailable in your own home. The book is one of those books you would like to keep and use again and again, but when the price of this book is factored into the cost of another book, it can be extremely expensive, and, therefore, you rarely use the book again.\n\nThe book is a fascinating account of what the author describes as an idyllic Christmas spent in Italy and it is well written, but it has serious shortcomings which make it unsuitable for most people.\n\nAdvertise Here\n\nWe Have Lots of Good Stuff...\n\nSubscribe Here\n\nWe Are Now An Official Affiliate of Birth.Movies.Death.\n\nBMD is now affiliated with Birth.Movies.Death and a secure donation via Paypal has been set up for any donations to help continue the work BMD has done since 2004.

At the age of eighty, Baldwin began to experience financial problems, as he had to support a wife who needed constant nursing, and four other enslaved women and men.,,,,,,,,,,\n\nIn spite of the financial problems, he had grown to cherish the African American slaves. On his eighty-fifth birthday, he began to buy out the rest of his slaves. He purchased twenty slaves and emancipated them and married one of his personal slaves,, who became pregnant with two daughters.,,,,,,,,,\n\nThe rest had to be bought because his plantation needed to be expanded to match his wealth.,,,,,,,,\n\nBy the time the Civil War began, Baldwin had sold the plantation to Henry Lommey and was working as a blacksmith. Baldwin was against slavery, both as a personal right and due to its effects on the economy.,,,,,,,,,\n\nHowever, he had begun to see the benefits that slavery had for the Southern economy and he began to soften his opposition.,,,,,,,,\n\nHowever, he strongly favored freedom for the slave as his main political goal. In 1849, he began to organize the African American community in New Orleans into a political group. He also started calling for immediate emancipation of slaves.,,,,,,,,,,,\n\nIt was not until 1856 that free-Black leaders had organized the national group called the \"New York Society\". Under the leadership of the organization's President, Josiah Quincy Adams, this group helped organize the American Anti-Slavery Society, with the first members being John Brown,,, and Henry Highland Garnet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\n\nIn 1856, Baldwin attended the first meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia. It was not until 1859 that Baldwin organized the \"Black Freedom Party\", a black political club with the purpose of ending slavery in the United States.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\n\nAt least 1 @, @ 851 Black people from different geographic, religious, ideological and social backgrounds made up the founders of the party.,,,,,,,,,,\n\nThese members came to be known as the \"African Americans\". With the help of the Black Freedom Party, which the Black Freedom Party helped to plan and promote the organization of the civil rights movement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\n\nIn the mid 1920s, during the heyday of the early civil rights movement, a black nationalist political group called the \"Negro Nationalist Association\" was formed. At the time,, they believed the best way for African Americans to achieve better treatment was for the United States to secede and become a separate country which would give all \"persons of African descent\" equal rights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\n\nLater, as the United States was expanding their territories through wars, the leaders realized that they needed to make the United States \"whole\" again, to provide better racial treatment.,\n\nAfter gaining support of most of the Black people in the country, a vote was held to decide whether to secede or remain in the

Gautier, Jr., Chief of Navy Personnel, Washington, D.C., at a Combined Arms Center (CAC) ceremony held at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.\n\nGautier said, \"This is a significant accomplishment that demonstrates your commitment to excellence on and off the battlefield. Your training, teamwork, professionalism and accomplishments will go down in history as an inspiring testament to our American soldiers.\"\n\nLieutenant Colonel David A. Baugh, 130th Engineer Brigade commander, accepted the awards on behalf of his men and expressed appreciation to the U.S. Army and the Navy for their continued support of the 132nd Engineer Battalion. \"Their continued focus and support is very much appreciated, both by our command and soldiers in the fight,\" said Baugh. \"We're honored to have the opportunity to serve alongside these men and women and our award reflects everyone's joint efforts.\"\n\nDuring the course of the operation, the 66th Engineer Company ( Construction ) and the 136th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion ( Combat Service Support ) have been awarded the Army Superior Unit Award. The 130th Engineer Brigade received the following awards:\n\nThe Navy Superior Unit Award is given to units who demonstrate superior combat capability, effectiveness, and professionalism. The 130th Engineer Brigade achieved this award by earning the distinction of Best-in-Class and the Marder III Infantry Squad Automatic Weapon Team from the Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment ( HHD ) 130th Engineer Brigade was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation. The award was presented to the HHD 130th Engineer Brigade staff by Chief Warrant Officer Four ( CW4) Timothy K. Wilson, 130th Engineer Brigade assistant adjutant general, for the battalion's performance during a four-week period in April and May.\n\nWilson said, \" Your men and women are an excellent example in the Army. They are proficient soldiers, who are willing to risk their lives to preserve what's best for the United States of America. The 130th Engineer Brigade has been honored as a best-in-class unit on numerous occasions. However, each award signifies the outstanding level performance and capabilities that you bring to the field.\"\n\nThe 130th Engineer Brigade has had a number of other awards since arriving in Afghanistan in 2005, including the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Afghan Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and several Meritorious Service Medals.\n\nThe Army's Chief of Staff recently recommended that the Army end its support for the 130th Engineer Brigade by fiscal year 2012. The request is the result of a restructuring of the Army's regional support structures. The brigade will still provide the same services to Afghanistan's soldiers and civilians and will continue to execute the \"Forward Combat Outpost,\" or FCO, mission there. The brigade, however, will not receive the additional $50 million it has been provided in recent years for support for the FCO mission.\n\nThe Army and the Navy say that although they will \"maintain

{"id":3435,"ended":true,"length":612,"text":"Matt Strauss, Comcast senior vice president of digital and emerging platforms, considered the 2012 Summer Olympics to be a `` watershed `` event for TV Everywhere services ; NBCUniversal announced that a total of 12.76 million authenticated users logged into its TV Everywhere apps during the games.\n\nBut what about the Olympics, which is a two-week TV event, including the opening ceremony and closing ceremonies? How does it stack up against more traditional annual events, such as the Super Bowl?\n\nComcast says it believes that its TV Everywhere service logged more than 3.6 million concurrent viewers at the peak of the 2012 Olympics, which makes it one of the biggest digital TV experiences to date.\n\nAccording to comScore Media Metrix, that was about 1 million more than the 2.2 million on average that tuned in for the 2012 Super Bowl on Fox.\n\nComcast said that the 2012 Olympics were a `` watershed `` event for TV Everywhere services, which is when users are logged in across platforms -- desktop, mobile or connected devices.\n\nBut what about more traditional annual events, such as the Super Bowl? NBCUniversal said that a total of 12.76 million authenticated users logged into its TV Everywhere apps during the games.\n\n\u201cViewership grew throughout the two-week period of Aug. 5, 2012, to Aug. 13, 2012, as more events were broadcast day and night.... We estimate that more than 80 percent of all consumers in the U.S. with television service watched at least one broadcast of the Olympics,\u201d Strauss said.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the Super Bowl ratings are generally believed to be higher than the Olympics by the Nielsen company, which compiles audience research for most of the major broadcast and cable TV networks.\n\nComcast said that the 2012 Olympics was also the top two-week digital content experience on the Internet, based on total unique visitors (2.1 million), and the top two-week total digital content experience across tablet, mobile and connected devices (3.6 million).\n\nIn addition, the Olympics saw more than 1.75 billion unique visits on desktops, tablets and mobile devices, based on comScore data.\n\nNBCUniversal said it believes that the 2012 Olympics was the third-most streamed event ever in digital history, and the most-streamed Olympics ever on tablets.\n\nThe company said that it delivered more than 658 petabytes of data during the London games, which is an amount equal to about 1,200 DVDs or about 35 Blu-ray discs.\n\nComcast said that its customers are able to access more than 800 sports and entertainment channels and more than 10,000 hours of video. Customers who use the Xfinity Stream app can watch more than 900 sports and entertainment channels, including live Olympic events.\n\nStrauss also noted that Xfinity TV customers have logged 9.1 billion hours this year of content consumed through Xfinity Stream and more than 5 billion hours of content consumed on Xfinity TV.\n\nAccording to Comcast\u2019s own numbers, the sports package -- Xfinity Sports \u2013 is delivering more than 1 billion minutes of live content watched every month.\n\n\u201cConsumers are making a tremendous commitment to watch all their favorite Olympic content

{"id":1113,"ended":false,"length":614,"text":"Cresswell struggled to establish himself at Wednesday under manager Paul Jewell early in the 2000 \u2013 01 season, before he resumed playing in the Premier League after signing for Leicester City on 1 September, 2001 \u2013 on loan, then returning to Chelsea after he was recalled three months into the loan spell. He spent the majority of the 2001\u201302 season on loan at Watford, before returning to Chelsea in January 2002, and being released in May of the same year. He was not offered a new contract at Chelsea.\n\nCresswell signed for Leeds United on a free transfer in July 2002, but struggled and was loaned to Doncaster Rovers in January 2003, where he earned a place in the team and had a successful loan spell that was extended to cover the rest of the season. His form earned him a permanent move to Doncaster. Leeds offered him a contract at the end of the 2003\u201304 season, but he rejected it due to wanting to return to Scotland.\n\nCresswell had a number of options, both in Scotland and abroad, but chose Hull City. He also signed professional terms with Hull City, with a potential \u00a3125k release clause. He only made 9 first team appearances, but in his 11 appearances he managed to score 3 times and picked up 2 assists. Cresswell was sent on loan to Rotherham United in January 2005.\n\nCresswell was given the number 3 shirt for the 2006\u201307 season. Cresswell's first goal for Rotherham was an 86th-minute tap-in for his first senior goal in 6 years. He scored his second on 21 March 2006 against Bristol Rovers, a game which was Cresswell's first start in over a year. On 14 July 2006, Cresswell announced his decision to leave Hull, saying \"I was keen to return to Scotland with Celtic to play at a higher level than I did in the Premiership with Leeds United.\". However, Celtic decided not to sign him and Cresswell signed for Rangers instead, for a fee of \u00a3500,000.\n\nDespite his good form in his first season for Rangers, Cresswell failed to gain a regular place in Steve McClaren's first team at the start of the 2007\u201308 season and was allowed to sign for Queens Park Rangers in January 2008, on a free transfer. Cresswell scored his first goal for Queens Park Rangers against Doncaster at Griffin Park, in a 2\u20132 draw on the first day of the 2008\u201309 season after coming off the bench, and was in a good run of form, but was hit by a fractured jaw in a match away to Doncaster on 31 October 2008. In the 2009\u201310 season he scored twice against Kilmarnock, also making his return from injury in the match. This was his final season with the club and the final of his career, which ended with a knee injury suffered while travelling with Rangers through the midlands in January 2011.\n\nPost-football career\n\nCresswell is a qualified chartered surveyor and continues to act as a Football Agent.

{"id":3523,"ended":true,"length":645,"text":"The actual degree of authority any pirate captain exercised over his crew was questionable, as he had no access to the procedures and sanctions of admiralty law that supported legitimate captains. Many pirate captains took advantage of the confusion between their crews and law enforcement to conduct kidnapping and ransom, or engage in other blackmarket ventures, while maintaining a facade of legality in public. Several of these practices were well-known to members of the Spanish court, and were the subject of official inquiries and investigations.\n\nThe first significant inquiry into the nature and extent of piracy and piracy laws was led by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and the conquistadors. Historians attribute the high incidence of piracy to the high number of buccaneers who formed part of Cort\u00e9s' army in his expedition. In 1522 Cort\u00e9s commissioned Governor Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna to begin investigating the various pirates in Mexico, which consisted of the P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez expedition and the expedition of Hernando de Soto. Santa Anna began his investigation by visiting the towns and villages along the Gulf Coast of what would become known as southern Texas, where he collected information on the various pirate ships and captains of the area. As a result of his investigation and inquiries into the nature of piracy and the laws relating to it, L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna issued a decree in 1523 that established a special council\u2014la Audiencia de Piratos\u2014which would deal with all matters pertaining to piracy. To this end, he authorized the governor to establish a prison for use by the Audiencia to detain suspected pirates. Since the only judicial facility at that time that could accommodate both prisoners and a court was the nearby prison at El Pinar in Tamaulipas, L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna transferred suspected pirates to the prison in 1523 and 1524.\n\nHistorian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de S\u00e1nchez del R\u00edo believes that L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna's decree marked an important legal change of perspective on piracy for the Spanish court. Prior to 1523, the Spanish government did not consider piracy to be a criminal offense requiring prosecution and punishment. This meant that in the absence of admiralty proceedings, the Spanish colonial government could only exert pressure on pirates through the use of force. However, the creation of the Audiencia de Piratos, the construction of an official prison on its grounds, and the transfer of suspected pirates to the prison established a legal basis for dealing with piracy, which made it eligible for prosecution under Spanish law. This shift in legal perspective in regard to piracy allowed the Spanish Crown and the Spanish government to develop maritime warfare procedures specifically for prosecuting pirates. Consequently, piracy became a more serious issue for the Spanish crown after 1523.\n\nBeginning with the creation of the Audiencia de Piratos, Spanish courts began to hold public trials against pirate captains. These trials were conducted with a degree of deliberation unusual in this period of history. The Spanish naval captains who conducted the hearings took great care to ensure a fair trial for all involved parties, regardless of their background. They were also concerned that the proceedings would not prejudice the Spanish Crown's reputation in order to prevent any interference in future court proceedings, and were very careful in ensuring that any witnesses that might potentially be helpful to the accused captains were not allowed to give testimony. As a result, the process of trial was slow and lengthy, and was fraught with a number of legal and logistical problems. This slow progress would have its impact on future legal and judicial systems in the Spanish empire.","token_len":720,"entropy":[8.1202,7.6403,0.4792,7.6635,8.5695,9.5622,5.5071,7.4345,1.343,1.5053,2.6109,1.7043,4.5059,1.3406,2.3222,2.632,2.6083,1.6303,5.3587,0.0619,1.4949,8.5206,2.2529,8.3338,2.5604,8.1873,0.2612,0.0643,2.8968,3.1992,6.7563,9.0529,5.9838,1.2806,5.5871,2.0802,0.1921,5.1826,3.0349,0.0049,1.2839,7.4728,4.5835,2.8778,5.5883,0.906,5.7934,0.4336,2.3137,4.5676,9.0823,1.3589,2.128,4.7904,3.0477,5.1191,0.0633,2.7592,8.9753,5.6377,5.2303,1.7467,3.7322,4.2487,1.7744,6.9141,0.1009,3.6074,3.4569,5.4806,1.0265,6.3203,2.3092,0.7473,4.2632,1.1043,4.0297,1.2861,1.0418,1.1997,5.5423,0.0222,0.2851,6.6226,5.1175,1.9389,1.3915,2.6302,4.6275,0.963,0.0081,6.3541,4.1092,2.2901,2.6001,1.4119,1.1749,0.0065,2.1466,4.6618,4.7558,6.7877,0.6228,1.3434,5.6904,1.2152,1.1698,0.0088,1.9183,4.3381,3.2212,5.3829,1.2938,4.69,0.0355,6.6177,2.2262,0.6704,3.0228,0.6331,4.4725,3.8315,8.8381,0.0028,0.2303,1.3363,2.9076,6.1366,0.6147,6.2889,0.9295,5.8304,4.0818,0.0469,0.6958,0.7442,0.9242,4.5658,2.2995,0.0506,8.3463,0.485,0.1088,1.6722,6.3409,3.1994,0.0042,8.4506,0.1973,0.2548,3.3633,2.2892,4.4756,3.5321,1.611,2.7059,3.6175,4.1994,4.2818,0.0268,4.6856,7.5831,4.8452,4.5353,0.8867,0.0002,1.8682,4.2346,2.6026,0.7026,5.448,4.2926,0.9484,6.2154,2.8859,2.7177,4.0691,1.7506,2.8069,5.7995,0.2278,3.2688,5.7093,6.9275,7.69,3.9123,2.1978,6.1364,3.2532,2.6791,3.6936,6.8432,1.9889,0.61,4.8588,0.6311,5.6787,3.2858,0.0027,1.3853,2.0867,0.4621,1.1994,6.9224,0.0097,4.2593,2.1177,0.5778,1.4309,4.2123,1.1925,4.4072,2.0304,0.6587,4.479,0.1433,4.023,3.004,1.1395,7.082,3.3919,0.4365,1.9133,0.0149,7.5234,3.4446,1.3515,1.7716,1.4476,5.9364,2.2164,0.7456,1.1442,3.0107,1.0457,3.3246,1.5128,5.4607,2.7165,0.6835,5.9166,0.3024,4.0264,2.3371,0.2966,0.3196,1.3617,2.346,3.546,4.2082,2.8957,0.5897,5.1109,0.4234,0.5491,1.5731,2.0857,3.9095,5.3174,0.0714,1.8636,0.1332,4.6034,0.0087,0.0024,0.0831,0.0234,0.0089,4.2964,0.9221,2.1028,1.9819,0.5912,1.7447,1.74,4.6582,1.5441,4.2833,5.5969,6.4956,9.7318,9.8824,7.2188,0.343,1.1421,4.5304,8.9508,1.2418,2.1849,1.9023,5.5255,0.0995,2.5261,2.1775,1.3115,0.0038,0.4306,1.331,5.8028,1.592,1.3533,0.1731,2.4717,4.0373,0.8301,3.9615,0.4578,3.2338,0.7287,7.505,1.9298,8.9783,1.5085,1.6001,9.1484,0.0265,0.0054,3.7838,3.0794,4.66,0.1621,1.2952,5.8805,1.2101,7.2759,7.0843,7.0613,4.4559,3.0919,0.1992,5.3822,1.7511,4.4672,5.2792,2.1608,0.0726,5.8088,3.3825,1.1379,1.7723,6.1791,4.0438,1.6616,4.3119,7.1914,2.1118,5.0097,5.4374,1.1857,0.0013,0.0001,0.0004,0.3332,3.6509,0.0032,0.0003,0.0052,0.0042,0.0045,6.2493,9.5939,0.1334,0.5283,1.1478,1.4665,2.3456,2.9993,1.7268,2.4826,6.3094,0.2883,0.5741,1.1165,0.0001,5.9795,1.6932,4.5316,3.91,0.2682,2.5234,4.2721,2.0681,0.0013,0.0003,2.9204,5.0027,0.4873,1.9088,4.9163,0.1503,3.7664,0.0062,0.0003,0.0046,0.0041,0.0055,1.2137,3.7709,5.8257,2.5506,0.2458,7.7738,2.9698,5.1677,6.4002,2.5601,0.8235,5.3968,0.8163,2.1305,3.1994,0.3739,5.6856,0.0029,1.7055,0.2803,0.1708,1.5985,2.0733,1.5982,2.9535,0.0436,3.6533,1.0899,1.2728,0.0637,0.7022,1.9712,0.3859,7.3302,3.6066,2.7255,0.8685,0.6518,3.3741,2.923,0.1263,4.2727,2.3593,2.1374,0.0009,10.2595,0.1087,0.0109,5.9755,0.5156,1.9409,2.7523,7.0635,1.1687,1.3652,3.189,7.5291,2.7997,0.3831,1.3769,3.7674,2.0022,2.0922,0.0049,2.4603,0.9765,3.3871,0.0191,2.0997,7.5099,0.0277,1.1063,3.461,0.0037,0.0006,3.7013,0.0049,0.0375,2.9861,3.4211,7.9724,0.044,3.2095,4.4763,2.8051,3.9058,4.9675,4.6247,0.4036,0.2193,0.3542,4.6732,0.0706,0.903,0.0692,0.4726,0.7365,0.7965,6.0102,0.9689,3.2138,3.1871,0.0912,5.6169,0.0335,2.0806,3.1435,1.9227,4.2347,0.8544,8.0026,0.1468,2.2075,2.242,2.3768,0.211,0.2282,2.9686,4.7607,0.6015,2.6729,4.1343,3.7596,5.1891,0.0073,0.7703,4.7646,0.8679,0.7282,7.0833,3.4837,1.094,2.2175,1.7219,0.2336,4.436,5.6217,6.8215,6.4674,6.6619,1.509,4.1349,0.3073,0.5641,6.445,0.0127,2.696,2.6723,0.815,4.0717,1.7621,2.5388,1.2506,0.4977,0.2994,4.2074,4.6063,1.0781,0.3979,0.6975,0.5144,0.0001,6.2924,1.7442,0.4513,3.936,0.0038,0.1451,1.1241,0.005,0.0004,0.5349,0.0095,0.0263,0.7709,2.6837,2.5277,1.955,0.4555,5.9433,4.4034,4.0628,3.296,2.6397,0.436,1.3729,2.5428,0.3542,1.1542,2.2004,3.9909,1.999,5.6966,0.0125,5.8232,0.0266,10.3172,0.9828,5.6228,2.0122,0.8566,3.1924,0.3462,1.7309,4.1356,7.1033,6.1194,2.2971,4.2584,1.3646,6.1327,4.7321,3.9727,2.6828,0.4482,1.8147,5.2141,1.6661,0.7989,2.2998,0.9831,3.2572,4.9233,1.5502,3.7519,0.0035,1.3346,3.6038,0.8966,3.7545,2.3699,1.4018,5.2215,0.8956,1.2696,3.8828,0.8795,3.1234,7.8718,0.8165,4.0516,3.0084,1.2621,4.5198,2.223,6.3733,0.0505,3.0042,2.9843,6.0455,1.6608,4.9608,2.2244,0.2537,3.4841,1.536,3.3906,3.8401,2.0183,1.7004,3.6045,0.2415,2.6747,3.9788,4.1925,1.6426,6.1908,1.3422,6.1353,1.6505,0.2851,4.6796,9.4781,1.2068,2.371,2.9923,0.22,5.0241,1.821,1.2942,3.5542,0.8409,0.1186,0.5928,1.155,6.1662,0.655,1.8396,1.6072,6.1689,0.8386,4.0999,0.7141,0.9588,3.517,5.6314,0.0106,4.9861,1.6819,0.0007,2.8099,2.3966,3.4604,1.5761,0.2329,3.9324,5.7375,5.0657,5.764,2.795,6.6738,4.6999,0.5236,3.7059,2.7925,3.4006,3.3905,3.7883,1.8315,0.9919,3.3493,3.7

{"id":576,"ended":true,"length":699,"text":"Harold Innis wrote his PhD thesis on the history of the Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ). The completion of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Yet, the history of the CPR was not without a dark side -- including the company's involvement in the notorious, illegal Indian Removal Act ( 1835-7 ). As the Canadian Parliament established a \" Crown colony \" in 1869 for those \" aboriginal nations \" outside the dominion of Canada, the issue of land settlement and settlement of Indian lands, in particular, was a very important concern and issue for the Government and the new parliament. The CPR was aware of these issues as it pursued its goal of linking Canada geographically by rail. The company's expansion west had relied in part because the railway needed to have its lands surveyed to assist it in its goal of building west out of its terminus at Brandon, Manitoba. And while the CPR was developing its plans to build westward, it was aware the land would become very important in facilitating that construction. In turn, the company faced criticism about the pace of its progress westward, given the number of Indians it had removed from British Columbia and other places it was building. As it became apparent the company was going to continue its westward expansion, the issue of Indian removal loomed larger -- particularly given the desire to remove the Sioux Indian People (Sioux nation) from eastern Canada and the Dakota Sioux People (Dakota nation) from the upper Great Plains. At the same time, the government set up a commission to investigate whether the removal of these two powerful Indian nations would jeopardize the westward expansion and settlement of both northern and southern Canada. At its core, the commission's report on the issue was the first serious effort to investigate the history of the CPR. It was also the first complete history written about the CPR, with some minor scholarly works written before it regarding other aspects of the company's history. This thesis builds upon the work done previously. I address the question of CPR involvement in the Indian Removal Act, examine the various views of the commission and the subsequent history of Indian removal, and argue that even if the Government of Canada had set up the commission as it did to investigate whether the CPR should continue westward, the commission would still have likely issued its report in 1880 in order to help inform the government decisions about CPR relations with Indians. One of the primary reasons for this delay was the fact the commission was a joint effort by the Government of Canada and the CPR -- giving the company a veto any recommendations that did not please in a way that could be seen as contrary to its interests. In that sense, the Government may not even have considered the CPR's presence in the commission as relevant to its recommendations. I conclude that the commission was unlikely to have made any recommendations that would have threatened the company's future westward expansion, given the fact the company was an important partner in the endeavor. Indeed, through the mid 1920s this idea of the CPR and the Government working together to advance a shared agenda did not go away -- not only in the sense that the CPR continued its westward expansion, but also the importance of its involvement in Indian removal policy remained a key element of its history. This thesis contributes to the understanding of CPR history as a \" hybrid \" history that includes aspects of the railway's political and economic history, as well as its social and institutional history. It furthers and extends the scholarship on the history of the CPR from its first studies to modern scholarship and the history of the Indian Removal Act itself.","token_len":720,"entropy":[7.3844,11.37,2.2216,5.6561,5.4563,6.4919,0.9718,0.8309,1.6434,4.0512,0.104,2.0843,6.5617,6.0844,2.0518,2.3485,11.9244,1.7822,2.6533,8.8332,0.0583,9.9564,0.7379,1.0666,4.4348,0.2107,1.2757,1.4964,1.2191,3.8483,3.8517,1.8318,2.21,5.2071,1.236,0.7279,1.9789,0.6629,0.5963,5.9459,1.5262,2.2349,4.1532,0.1302,0.6337,1.0424,1.5655,1.6832,4.0628,4.3371,4.7888,0.7427,7.2299,5.5517,1.0727,7.2874,0.4017,2.4756,0.2876,1.0672,4.8505,5.6894,4.4428,6.1537,4.0092,0.7038,1.5291,4.7129,6.4078,2.882,5.7787,0.7173,3.6436,1.9997,3.7948,6.223,5.1435,2.6408,3.6294,11.3082,8.9806,0.6032,1.1841,1.0142,4.4081,6.023,6.0673,4.113,7.3605,6.4497,2.0143,7.2811,1.0508,5.5055,0.425,0.881,1.3241,1.1055,6.3021,0.3626,4.8593,7.2794,2.1965,4.1562,1.1674,3.5529,2.17,3.4029,4.1531,1.6396,1.1908,1.4016,2.2128,4.5671,2.0329,4.9,4.5167,4.8097,1.7605,0.7877,4.6112,3.6939,1.4392,5.8306,6.3453,0.6102,1.8117,2.3771,1.2001,8.6484,0.3112,2.9787,0.8505,3.8388,2.7948,4.6977,0.9687,4.4986,0.0943,7.2283,2.5314,8.0788,6.0463,3.087,1.5806,1.9505,4.2637,1.6664,5.9453,6.1299,5.595,8.1801,4.7112,0.4864,7.5182,2.6187,4.7642,5.3224,0.7981,4.7199,3.0575,7.4284,5.3763,3.2608,6.8844,2.6746,0.5144,2.1326,5.3136,0.1104,2.9497,9.074,7.3023,0.5697,3.1613,8.2222,0.0768,2.355,8.1782,2.0312,3.0166,0.5882,5.3876,3.3689,0.7963,1.5157,1.2935,5.2951,1.7864,3.0572,1.7143,1.1256,3.0576,4.4769,0.9214,1.4977,0.8718,3.3943,5.0909,4.2084,3.241,4.1808,4.7659,2.8925,2.5226,6.3367,3.8199,4.2634,0.3207,2.4623,4.7406,0.0292,0.764,1.1545,6.8598,4.4237,5.0953,1.1108,6.5532,0.4628,1.7656,3.7027,5.4855,0.3365,1.5098,4.6833,0.8576,4.1954,0.0332,4.4022,2.1585,1.2233,2.9026,0.961,4.796,0.22,1.777,3.4571,3.3213,2.8684,2.4098,4.9635,1.0329,3.1652,3.1866,3.6055,3.3938,2.8713,1.9033,0.9713,3.3983,0.2957,4.1849,2.3732,3.6885,0.06,0.4414,0.7178,0.8601,4.5246,0.2353,4.3719,2.245,8.6044,0.0068,3.2935,4.4574,2.7707,3.0077,0.4576,7.9723,2.2317,4.0281,1.9739,8.2746,4.5383,7.7163,3.1745,2.4161,0.0008,7.0259,0.4357,0.4096,5.6886,0.4713,2.1359,1.3749,7.6821,2.6962,3.5807,0.5244,0.3325,0.0485,0.0008,0.6061,0.8392,0.178,1.5622,6.5582,4.1072,0.7931,0.4661,4.3202,0.447,0.7715,0.0022,0.1156,0.7396,3.7615,7.0671,1.4,0.7203,2.2572,0.4213,1.5595,3.6373,0.5776,6.1757,0.355,3.4988,3.1336,7.5318,4.0745,1.4407,2.4838,4.3726,0.0177,0.6977,8.0738,0.0415,0.1913,3.2924,7.375,0.2822,5.5234,5.908,0.0808,0.2797,0.9049,0.1671,4.3029,3.5166,4.274,0.3996,0.3025,1.5842,2.4257,1.1538,4.1551,0.4294,3.5407,1.2998,3.0059,3.3203,4.3151,2.9617,0.4268,2.5973,0.6935,4.616,0.2084,0.3733,0.3384,1.0617,2.0505,1.7462,3.476,0.5978,0.1751,6.9783,3.2484,6.0845,1.9752,0.3024,1.615,2.156,2.8507,3.84,3.9591,8.9374,5.8374,2.6338,3.5645,2.3286,12.1488,4.8337,3.0418,0.118,0.4006,2.6782,0.0896,1.6308,0.4316,3.6725,8.0412,6.1175,1.1791,1.1484,2.0793,3.1547,5.9163,3.7735,6.1077,7.2159,1.1289,3.5133,0.4096,8.5086,7.3478,0.3668,0.6918,2.3285,0.0207,0.0335,1.9606,10.7725,0.6103,5.1714,5.8128,1.6513,0.738,3.505,1.3051,2.2669,5.0087,3.01,0.2607,6.8018,1.4664,1.4445,0.2713,3.8863,0.3596,5.5592,1.2246,0.8032,6.2481,2.8054,0.0629,1.3908,5.4243,0.433,1.8693,0.9024,2.6238,2.2722,0.968,5.5052,0.7523,4.9851,0.4954,0.5363,4.0697,2.3395,2.2389,0.0725,0.3599,1.3699,3.3319,1.6986,1.5125,0.504,6.1647,7.4004,2.1825,1.0054,2.0853,7.8505,4.4867,2.36,0.034,4.4825,3.6463,0.7898,2.9245,7.9894,1.8433,6.2087,8.3851,1.5664,3.8933,0.8908,5.7709,1.1483,0.0867,4.3943,2.8635,1.2952,2.3513,5.8295,0.9056,0.9536,2.2698,3.3644,2.1242,1.8106,3.7034,5.4941,3.1974,2.5006,0.639,2.4504,0.2691,0.0993,0.1908,0.3831,6.3954,5.3193,7.5485,0.8208,3.5406,1.7697,5.4344,9.401,5.4556,2.3075,4.0542,0.0092,8.1494,8.398,3.8737,2.2764,0.0972,3.3502,2.1798,1.7917,0.1506,5.1539,0.0009,1.2067,2.7515,0.3601,2.5889,4.9539,0.913,0.1668,0.5221,3.4561,5.5686,2.9506,5.5091,0.186,3.3344,0.9097,1.6085,1.9187,5.6923,0.5189,1.15,7.9569,1.4609,4.9284,0.8784,1.1406,6.396,0.9677,3.5591,3.3008,1.9915,0.702,3.6123,2.5476,5.6679,0.0264,0.625,2.3039,1.1881,0.8884,1.8625,1.0289,0.6567,7.0861,0.5641,4.2209,0.0754,2.4995,4.8627,0.0254,0.0932,2.3214,3.5681,0.5792,2.4301,2.1573,1.2874,1.3112,5.3056,2.4968,3.8218,0.4746,0.7566,6.9506,0.5066,4.8252,0.0035,7.6184,1.2233,6.0233,5.4543,0.2305,6.7733,5.5816,1.2966,1.252,0.5257,4.1364,1.0672,4.3629,5.0102,0.2529,1.311,3.984,3.4948,4.5696,2.715,4.5744,0.2163,3.9476,1.642,3.8357,4.5139,2.4319,2.3831,0.974,5.154,0.2951,0.6176,1.134,4.6896,3.2972,1.6097,0.0165,0.0618,1.0319,0.1686,0.2609,2.7522,5.0602,0.2679,3.5551,2.7272,0.2614,3.3417,2.2803,4.8276,9.3676,2.8696,2.4197,2.9143,0.4863,2.619,3.6144,0.3271,3.3163,2.6954,6.8488,0.2812,0.8107,2.3315,0.7164,3.1241,3.0444,2.5994,1.3422,4.9044,8.4942,1.025,3.6288,2.1206,3.8429,4.9697,0.421,0.9309,7.8535,1.3246,6.082,1.6216,0.9725,1.7935,1.3523,1.8788,0.0294,0.005,1.9411,3.6662,0.8128,5.7329,0.5386,0.2578,1.8956,4.4498,3.9318,4.5529,4.565,0.4888,7.1452,1.7338,0.6362,1.7318,0.0543,0.4476,0.0853,3.875,1.9452,4.0816,7.8697,1.7593,6.3588,4.6177,2.8915,3.2678,3.3343,0.0478,0.7606,4.6346,0.1165,0.0249,4.9507,0.2946]}
{"id":3190,"ended":true,"length":655,"text":"Norman remained a travelling showman for another 10 years following his encounter with Joseph Merrick, and exhibited, among others, a troupe of midgets, a'Man in a Trance ', and a troupe of women dancers.\n\nIn 1872, Norman produced \" The Devil and His Slave \", an attempt to revive a subject that was of no particular interest to the public at that time, but which Norman did care about. Although this was the first performance of the piece ever recorded, the record is not regarded as of great historic or artistic importance, partly because very little is known about the piece. It is not known how many performances it saw, nor has any description of it existed for 150 years. One account describes it as the story of The Devil and His Slave.\n\nThe only work to match those four works in its first recording is his \"The Great Devil\", recorded in Paris in 1886 by a Parisian gramophone manufacturer. This also bears no historic or artistic importance.\n\nOther recordings of Norman are \" The Great Devil\" which was recorded in Paris in 1886 by a Parisian gramophone manufacturer. This also bears no historical or artistic importance. In 1887 Norman recorded his first \"Hunchback\" at his theater in Leicester, England, as described earlier.\n\nTitles from the 1800s, such as \" Great Devil\" which was recorded in 1887, bear no historical or artistic importance.\n\n\" Great Devil \" was recorded in Paris in 1886 by a Parisian gramophone manufacturer. This bears no historical value. In 1906 Norman recorded \"The Great Devil\" again, but this time at the Theatre de la Nouvelle Halle in Paris.\n\nThe man who discovered Joseph Merrick, and the theatre producer and amateur actor Norman Norman, both recorded this title at the same time. It bears no artistic value.\n\nIn 1906 Norman recorded \"Hunchback\" as well, at the Theatre de la Nouvelle Halle in Paris.\n\n\"The Devil and His Slave\" is now lost. It is noted that Norman did not record his first \"Hunchback\", as described earlier, until 1887. So it is now safe to assume that this title was recorded during that same year. This title is now regarded as not of particular value ; it is often given away to collectors, who regard it as of no significance.\n\nAs with \" The Man Called Vincenzo \", the only recording of the piece exists in an incomplete state and its value is purely historic.\n\nNorman was still exhibiting in 1909, so \" The Great Devil \" was probably recorded soon thereafter. It is now believed that \" The Great Devil \" was recorded in 1906 in Paris.\n\nWebsites & Other Links...\n\nI have a few websites that I keep as archives, and also to add a bit of colour to each page.

{"id":4425,"ended":true,"length":651,"text":"M. F. K. Fisher, writing in The New York Times, stated that millions of American women in the 19th century organised `` every aspect of their lives.. as much as possible in the interests of women'' and that their efforts allowed them to live much longer than in the past.\n\nFisher, who argued ``the time was ripe for a feminism, the conditions were right,'' said that ``a lot of the old women did not recognize what was beginning to happen,'' and that ``men are too much invested in themselves to see anything very clearly.''\n\nThis is one of the few times and the few places that Jane Austen's views on women's place in society are referenced directly in print by her contemporaries.\n\nThe only earlier references in printed and non-printed sources have to do with her religious views.\n\n1. An obituary published in The Guardian newspaper of London by a biographer of Austen's stated that she had hoped that Christianity would be more widely accepted because women's minds had been emancipated by science and that more women would be allowed to read the Bible since they could do so in peace.\n\n2. A posthumously published account of Austen's life by her long-time friend, her niece Fanny Austen (1812-78) -- a sister-in-law of Austen's father, Henry -- stated that Jane Austen supported the emancipation of the slaves because ``they were all children of the same God... '' and argued against the idea that slavery was bad for Christianity since many of the slave owners would be Christians themselves.\n\nOther writers on both sides of the slavery debate have used Austen's words to support their opinions.\n\nIn contrast to the above examples, the following quote is the first known use of Jane Austen's first name in a non-fiction source to reference the equality of women and men.\n\nFisher also wrote that ``it is quite safe to assume that the majority of the members of the suffrage organisations were women'' because ``the movement has been entirely theirs.''\n\nThe author stated that ``women have been making plans and plotting in the same way which men do for over a hundred years.''\n\nFisher wrote that ``the women are more likely to go out and protest in front of houses and shops, and they are just as likely to go out at night to work as they were at any other time in the past... they are not averse to using the force of law and common sense and are quite capable in a case of necessity... and they are as fearless as men of speaking their minds if they see a thing ought to be altered.''\n\nJane Austen's 1821 novel ''Northanger Abbey'' provides an example where her point of view is most clearly illustrated.\n\nIn response to the charge of an elderly gentleman in the novel that women should ``abide'' by the traditions of the past, Austen's characters reply:\n\n''If a gentlewoman did not go her own ways, there would be a terrible row... If she had her head screwed on too tight, a gentlewoman could do no good.''\n\nFisher's views and the views of her female contemporaries are important reminders of the past.\n\nThe issue of women's empowerment is not new and is a key contemporary political issue.\n\nAlthough Jane and Elizabeth Austen were writing about another time in history, their writings about issues that were important to women of their time still offer the value of insights to the

{"id":3786,"ended":true,"length":664,"text":"On March 9, Cross suddenly resigned. His resignation was quickly followed by that of Woods, his deputy. The next day William Ashbury Buchanan, Minister without Portfolio, did the same. The final resignation came on March 12. Although Buchanan had a much stronger international reputation than either Cross or Woods, he, too, quit, as did his secretary-treasurer.\n\nIn spite of the suddenness of the resignations of these three officials, the public explanation for the departures has been a matter of public discussion, and, indeed, litigation. There seems to have been little doubt that the men were not happy with the way things were going, and that they were willing to leave. One of the problems was the use of the term \u201cimmoral and objectionable\u201d to describe the activities of those who had resigned. The Department of Justice claimed that its public statement was purely descriptive of their conduct while in office, and that they had not used that language in private correspondence. Woods, for his part, in court testimony claimed that his statements were only \u201cprivate\u201d and did not reflect an official position.\n\nAs a result, the British government had to settle a lawsuit filed by Cross. His suit claimed that the Department\u2019s public statements were defamatory against him. It also claimed that the government was liable to him because he acted under his authority within the Department. The final result was a settlement whereby the government admitted to no liability to Cross : the statement that he was \u201cimmoral and objectionable\u201d was withdrawn. In its turn, the Department of Justice dropped the cross-claim on the payment of \u00a31 000 to Cross and the payment by the government to him of all expenses. Buchanan, by the way, was not the first Canadian member of parliament to sue the government ; it happened first in the U.K. when William Wilberforce sued over the same charge in the years 1833-7. Cross, moreover, filed another suit against the government \u201d for injury to his character.\u201d No action was taken on that action, though. Another suit filed against Cross by the University of Ottawa, which claimed that the University had been defamed by his letter to the Daily News, was allowed to die.\n\nAn intriguing detail about the affair is the fact that it occurred shortly after an attack on the Canadian federalist newspaper the Toronto Daily News. It is thought that at least one Conservative Party political operative in the Ottawa area was responsible for the attack. Since the attack came shortly before the resignations, it is suspected that the pressure was behind the resignations. As it turned out, the resignations may not even have been part of the plan.\n\nThe affair shows how pressure from Ottawa (or, more accurately, Ottawa-Toronto ) can affect the policy of the government. Woodrow Wilson and the Canadian federalists would have tried to maintain a neutral approach to the issue of neutrality. The influence of the anti-federalist and Conservative parties could, however, not be ignored. Ultimately, it resulted in the government having to compromise on issues of neutrality.\n\n[1] The term foreign minister (or \u201c foreign minister for Canada\u201d) became the norm during and soon after the First World War. For a time after that, the title became the office of minister without portfolio. After that term came to refer to a person who does not hold a portfolio but who nonetheless has a major (though subordinate ) role in the policymaking of the government. The latter usage still prevails in some

{"id":1436,"ended":true,"length":619,"text":"The Crimson Tide began their defense of their 2010 BCS championship at home against the San Jose State Spartans, and before a record crowd in a newly expanded Bryant \u2013 Denny Stadium, Alabama scored on its first four possessions to cruise to an easy 42-3 win.\n\nFreshman quarterback AJ McCarron connected on a 48-yard touchdown pass to Robert Foster, Chris Black added a 21-yard interception return for a touchdown, and the Crimson Tide piled up 516 total yards.\n\nIn addition, Alabama scored on its first two drives and held San Jose State to just three total first downs and negative-28 yards of total offense in the first half.\n\nThe only sour note for UA fans had to deal with the defense, as San Jose State came within a touchdown late in the second quarter to make it 27-3. The Spartans outgained Alabama 245 to 115 in the first half while the Crimson Tide totaled eight tackles for loss, but five of those belonged to Alabama freshman All-American defensive end\/outside linebacker Dre Kirkpatrick.\n\nKirkpatrick\u2019s first quarter sack resulted in a safety, and his performance continued to impress as he added three more tackles, a sack, a forced fumble and a pass breakup. Defensive end LaQuon Treadwell finished the day with five tackles, a quarterback hurry and two tackles for loss.\n\nBrent Musburger\n\nChris Black\n\nChris Black returns to the end zone for Alabama's first score...\n\nAlabama's second score set the tone for the game...\n\nThe home crowd would not have to wait long for another touchdown...\n\nThis one was set up by a screen pass to running back Trent Richardson.\n\nRichardson did the rest and raced 55 yards for the score.\n\nThe redshirt freshman was also the star of the show when it came to the return game, as he returned the first half kickoff 102 yards.\n\nThe Crimson Tide were forced to punt on its first two drives of the game, but still managed to take a 14-3 lead less than 5 minutes into the second quarter.\n\nOn the first play following the kickoff, McCarron hit Robert Foster with a 48-yard touchdown pass to put the Alabama lead at two scores.\n\nA 45-yard field goal by kicker Brett Caddell gave UA a three score lead at halftime, but San Jose State didn\u2019t go away that easily.\n\nThe Spartans responded to an Alabama interception on its first possession of the second half with a 45-yard field goal of their own. That made the score 27-10. With under 30 seconds remaining in the half, McCarron connected with DeAndrew White on a 9-yard touchdown pass to push Alabama\u2019s lead to 31 points.\n\nThe only touchdown by San Jose State was a 24 yard reception by receiver Devon Allen with 9:48 remaining.\n\nA late interception by Alabama\u2019s Mark Barron ended the team\u2019s chance at icing the game, and the Tide eventually had to punt.\n\nThe win over the Spartans was Alabama\u2019s fifth straight, which tied the program record for consecutive wins set in 2008.\n\nThe 49 points scored Saturday are the third most by an SEC team in a single game behind Florida\u2019s 61 points against Arkansas in 1994 and Georgia\u2019s 60 points against Texas A&M in 2005. Alabama improved to 5-0 for the first time in program history.\n\nAlabama returns to action against Ole Miss in Oxford next Saturday.","token_len":727,"entropy":[11.1411,1.6782,7.1197,1.9602,6.4042,1.9342,3.251,7.7417,5.9928,0.0477,2.5419,4.4481,2.0004,0.6574,1.1226,4.3612,1.9271,0.0261,1.0124,1.7433,2.78,6.2595,4.6651,6.4981,2.1804,4.4761,3.6153,9.0503,5.5912,8.1673,9.0157,6.3264,3.1357,2.9597,2.0609,3.7444,5.0142,4.2524,2.7092,1.1743,4.5591,0.5502,2.5258,7.9313,1.0321,2.2288,4.5493,5.0458,0.1587,3.9257,1.3853,0.6236,0.8987,0.0006,7.2809,0.1602,1.8401,5.4378,0.1047,0.0003,0.0016,6.228,0.5206,0.7806,6.1915,0.0166,0.0068,0.972,0.8316,0.7259,6.4728,4.8308,1.615,9.2142,6.886,10.3692,0.6588,4.1303,0.0134,0.0266,5.0022,0.3494,0.7576,0.4525,1.1222,1.1537,0.3394,1.74,1.0255,0.0009,5.6432,0.8274,4.9451,4.86,2.2591,0.0504,2.5607,0.5959,0.0003,3.9464,4.3709,1.1885,1.9492,4.0751,1.6032,2.3985,0.7812,2.0216,1.4047,3.565,4.0929,4.7059,0.0706,0.0209,0.2926,1.8659,3.4126,3.2761,6.6127,0.038,3.0683,10.0431,3.9729,6.7281,2.4553,3.0101,1.5563,0.0696,2.2395,0.8893,1.5397,0.3867,0.3931,0.4224,0.0002,1.6587,5.8173,11.0346,0.7771,2.5187,7.2796,2.6356,5.7697,0.624,9.4114,0.0084,1.3934,5.6249,1.7418,1.4838,5.5764,0.0349,0.0087,4.2047,2.9422,2.2563,1.2372,5.0893,0.0829,0.0399,1.4375,0.794,1.9314,4.1228,0.3052,3.7998,0.0069,2.7475,1.3251,2.3895,2.0157,5.7639,1.9062,0.044,2.5187,9.205,2.7354,6.4683,2.1229,0.3424,1.975,0.1754,5.3811,2.0499,0.7477,0.0006,6.1238,6.1491,4.0616,1.6855,0.1384,1.5795,4.3499,7.487,1.4503,0.674,9.8327,0.0209,3.2606,5.3739,7.1653,0.0529,0.369,4.2923,0.599,6.7355,3.4076,0.0566,8.0702,1.5985,0.1124,0.4265,0.1934,0.0002,4.0056,0.0059,0.0002,17.1061,7.815,4.8206,3.5275,5.6098,1.4799,5.0085,0.0694,0.8036,4.5179,2.5429,1.1095,2.6657,5.5393,4.8978,1.9736,4.0003,2.6016,0.6279,3.8074,3.3259,2.9075,0.951,2.9908,2.9503,1.5993,0.9897,1.5107,1.185,0.0028,0.6409,0.69,2.4506,0.8137,0.7759,6.172,0.5947,6.3059,3.1512,0.7344,0.0852,0.0017,0.0026,3.8375,2.2168,2.6558,0.4544,2.8936,0.2015,0.7616,1.8083,3.7312,1.289,0.8333,1.8388,3.1131,0.0375,0.0929,0.2666,0.2541,0.0002,5.1379,7.2782,4.5469,1.2201,0.0042,6.0027,0.0003,7.2237,1.9585,1.3711,0.0002,2.823,0.3673,6.5628,0.8113,0.852,6.7819,0.1936,1.1442,3.2283,1.6581,0.9872,3.889,10.1661,1.6556,0.0003,3.3173,1.5705,3.1855,1.7807,7.7256,1.59,0.7315,0.4267,0.5785,2.2399,4.0079,0.2264,0.0002,2.1532,7.0426,1.77,6.3416,2.532,2.3402,4.1094,1.5127,0.3435,0.8723,3.8276,4.1511,4.0493,0.1546,0.0002,5.4084,2.4519,1.7821,4.2982,0.5758,1.1867,1.4216,7.1662,0.3104,1.9748,4.9504,0.0217,2.9959,0.828,2.196,1.8625,0.0003,3.2897,0.0005,0.0075,5.2034,3.7491,2.3173,4.0747,5.3219,8.7308,0.0419,0.7126,1.369,1.1799,1.6002,0.5758,0.0002,1.6316,6.609,0.2574,0.7752,3.2985,4.0308,2.4602,5.0438,0.5205,0.4103,3.7123,3.4143,5.0367,0.2082,0.1539,1.5734,4.7347,2.0025,1.709,1.5164,0.1935,3.7878,2.5276,2.3347,4.6144,1.1184,7.7942,0.0511,4.8448,0.375,0.0002,1.6909,1.9819,0.0007,3.1318,3.8541,0.2317,0.5837,1.9127,4.5896,1.0109,1.8749,0.566,2.1754,0.0192,1.1788,0.754,1.4246,5.4072,1.3145,0.3196,3.9994,1.3144,3.9484,0.008,2.241,0.0234,9.8145,0.0031,5.1173,0.2824,0.6558,0.0255,1.0605,1.3055,0.2959,0.3803,0.0002,3.9863,0.6015,2.4178,3.3234,7.388,0.4697,3.1557,0.1228,5.6636,0.0071,0.0006,3.8225,5.6623,0.2224,1.6992,0.4029,6.1315,0.0303,0.0009,0.7843,0.1681,0.8227,4.5378,0.4756,5.9963,2.7446,0.6799,6.3803,5.2427,0.4253,0.3459,0.0002,4.0636,7.9551,0.0213,0.101,1.2053,0.006,1.3733,6.5936,6.5102,4.9608,5.262,0.7949,3.1188,3.8315,0.9086,6.3801,4.66,0.2449,2.9561,1.1702,1.3068,0.5862,6.3666,0.019,0.0005,4.7846,11.2428,2.3409,0.4887,4.8802,3.121,6.2021,3.6601,0.7749,0.2518,0.0002,1.4816,2.9891,5.6252,3.3419,4.4372,2.0156,4.4303,2.1949,4.3663,0.9274,2.1105,1.6308,0.0055,1.4219,0.1798,2.0886,0.3768,4.8289,0.0086,0.0368,0.8175,0.0066,5.5285,0.533,0.0005,1.0112,5.7031,4.4822,1.7943,2.7479,2.4474,0.0035,4.1846,0.9089,6.4073,7.7371,3.3302,0.1315,1.1329,1.3567,0.0396,2.2257,0.0821,4.3799,0.0013,0.002,4.6259,1.3278,4.0908,6.3754,1.0944,1.7171,0.3041,4.8385,0.1147,0.0028,1.3085,0.5567,0.5572,5.8877,2.5687,11.191,0.0138,0.0341,0.1101,0.1622,5.085,5.0627,0.5678,0.093,0.0003,1.4382,4.9913,3.8198,3.1659,4.6267,0.0187,0.0008,1.6058,1.465,4.0653,6.7219,3.8591,0.6645,3.9614,5.7549,4.5419,3.2467,4.2159,0.0956,3.738,1.317,1.5437,0.441,0.0003,3.7945,5.2826,3.3131,0.7594,3.6031,7.0041,0.0166,0.1031,7.6863,3.6361,5.5949,0.4906,6.3262,3.3606,0.0631,0.0221,5.4993,1.2346,12.3119,0.7042,3.1761,1.9105,1.7763,1.2079,1.2005,5.0449,3.7926,1.1828,1.7167,2.3186,0.3183,0.0003,1.5204,4.6922,3.9221,1.6385,0.507,1.5746,3.8237,4.3037,0.1207,0.0074,3.3016,1.0909,2.7598,3.8317,5.1112,0.9915,4.0521,1.5362,0.9231,3.5939,1.0398,6.2637,1.8364,3.1684,0.9526,0.3326,0.0004,2.1923,9.0938,7.8012,4.3541,6.7833,4.2681,0.5734,2.8469,2.8874,1.3433,1.6055,2.6443,0.2721,1.047,1.0931,1.061,0.3413,6.6765,4.4152,5.5887,0.0582,0.0085,6.4748,1.2096,3.8081,3.5493,1.7716,4.6541,0.6042,3.2401,1.4522,0.0081,0.0055,3.8227,0.4843,0.4703,3.0832,1.4041,0.0003,0.0008,0.1916,3.3906,0.1694,4.7987,6.4648,0.0891,2.2632,0.0067,1.2911,4.5257,0.148,2.1347,0.0122,1.4474,1.6084,0.0071,1.3876,0.2161,0.0003,3.5329,3.9549,0.6378,3.

{"id":2321,"ended":true,"length":578,"text":"According to Sify, the film `` started on a low key `` but `` swept the box @ - @ office `` from its second day of release. The film grossed \u20b9 60 lacs [$ 1,300] on its opening day, and \u20b9 90 lacs [$ 1,600] on its second day @ cinema theatres across the country.\n\nIn spite of opening simultaneously across 1,400 cinema @ India box office on April 3, the movie got a record breaking response from Chennai, which was the single biggest market [by number of tickets sold ] for Tamil film and the second-highest number of tickets sold for a Kollywood film.\n\nThe film had set a new record for opening the Tamil cinema theatres in April and was also dubbed in 11 languages to help to spread its reach amongst the audience in other parts of the country :\n\n1. Tamil\n\n2. Andhra\n\n3. Karnataka\n\n4. Puducherry\n\n5. North-East\n\n6. Sri Lanka\n\n7. Middle East\n\n8. United Kingdom\n\n9. USA\n\n10. Australia\n\nSify goes on to say that the `` Tamil and Telugu dubbed versions of Mani Ratnam's much-awaited `Arundhati' movie will be released in more than 300 cinema theaters across Andhra Pradesh.\n\nTamil dubbed version of \"Arundhati\" being released in Andhra Pradesh:\n\nMani Ratnam's \"Arundhati\" released in Telugu too:\n\nOther languages releases that might come in the near future are Malayalam, Kannada and Hindi. Tamil version already recorded the record highest opening of any Tamil film at the Indian box office.\n\nThe first batch of the film has been launched to a packed house at a ceremony held yesterday in Chennai. More than 3,500 people paid \u20b9 100 each to watch the film on its first day at the Chennai theatres.\n\nMani Ratnam's films have always opened to huge audiences even in non-mainstream cinema theatres. So it is no wonder that fans who missed seeing the film during its opening show, are keen to catch up on the movie. The movie was released in multiple screens in many centres.\n\nThe Mani Ratnam's movie got such an immediate response at the Chennai theatre that a screen in the neighbouring Koyambedu [Chennai market] had to be reopened, Sify reports.\n\nSify also reports that some of the screenings were halted after running short of tickets or because of overcrowding. In the latter cases the cinema managers asked movie-goers to come back another day. The manager at the New Chennai Theatre told Sify \"Our customers were returning at times when other movies were supposed to have started.\"\n\nThe first show in Chennai lasted through the mid afternoon and was packed to the rafters. Mani Ratnam's \"Arundhati\" [starring Jayaram] is the first major mainstream movie that the celebrated director has released in recent memory.

{"id":2693,"ended":true,"length":660,"text":"Following the death of Caracalla, Macrinus allowed Caracalla's mother, Julia Domna, and his aunt Julia Maesa, to settle in their home town of Emesa. Julia Domna, who was considered the main heir to the throne, quickly replaced her father as the regent. Julia Maesa, who had an older daughter named Anna, took up residence in Carthage with the hopes of being regent. She soon realized that she had no ability to rule the province independently. The local military leaders grew concerned for their own interests, and were looking to secure their own interests. They refused to support her if she failed to secure them some financial independence.\n\nMeanwhile, Julia Maesa continued to act as the regent. After several incidents that caused chaos in the province, and were seen as signs of weakness to the local commanders, they began to make their move on her. Julia Maesa realized that she was completely outmatched and out of options. She appealed to her father in Rome for help, telling him that she was in danger. Julia Domna was also very concerned, and sent a general to help his daughter.\n\nMeanwhile, in Rome, Julia Maesa's sister Julia Gallia was sent to Carthage to help her. At first, the two were quite close. They both took up residence in the same house, and Julia Maesa even taught Julia Gallia how to make wine. Then, when Julia Gallia wanted Julia Maesa to teach her how to handle a dagger and sword, Julia Maesa was furious. She told Julia Gallia that she only knew how to make wine, and had no training in combat. She also argued that she was only a maid, and didn't need such advanced training. Julia Gallia eventually broke the friendship with Julia Maesa, accusing her of teaching her to be a soldier and then leaving her in Carthage. The next time the two saw each other, Julia Gallia had grown to become a strong and independent woman.\n\nThe two sisters quickly learned that they could trust one another. Julia Maesa explained to her sister that she wasn't truly in any danger, and even suggested that she should start taking precautions in the same way that Julia Gallia was. Julia Gallia decided to leave Carthage and move through the local countryside. However, she ran into her father's best friend Sejanus, who was an important soldier in the province. Sejanus took her at her word, and took her to meet a local commander named Gavius. Since Gavius had a reputation for being a very powerful man, Julia Maesa decided to use her to take control of the province. With Gavius's help, she was able to take over the province.\n\nJulia Maesa knew that the army was unhappy with Caracalla, and it was time to take advantage of that. She went before the army, told them of how terrible Caracalla had been and what he had done to her family, and how he had put her father and his sister in danger. She also convinced them that Caracalla had not only killed her parents, but had also killed her sister Julia Maesa (or as the Romans referred to her, Julia Domna ). This would cause the soldiers to see that she was as trustworthy as Julia Gallia was. When the soldiers accepted her as the new governor of the province, she was able to rule it with relative ease. The province was under her control for most of Caracalla's reign, though they didn't completely submit to her.","token_len":727,"entropy":[2.5081,4.5036,0.1364,8.3428,4.8106,0.8646,0.9008,6.8614,7.5045,3.7786,7.4978,4.5404,0.0377,0.0045,1.9736,3.5584,1.7807,5.7973,9.2587,6.0316,0.3134,2.7467,1.7961,5.0925,5.199,6.7583,6.1611,2.0946,1.6722,5.7636,0.5807,3.5559,1.4458,4.0146,0.3023,7.1462,3.3258,1.4537,2.6785,2.2307,0.0034,2.6271,1.2892,1.4387,5.5729,2.2522,6.1955,3.9336,0.5608,1.3028,0.6574,0.4525,6.0365,6.3833,2.7879,1.8794,2.1024,1.5721,4.9831,0.0046,1.4521,2.5045,2.4161,0.0,1.8452,1.3171,1.0574,5.6883,3.8906,2.8511,2.3049,4.5077,0.6883,3.392,3.0026,0.7416,0.3904,9.3971,0.0134,3.7972,2.7028,6.6504,0.1888,3.5142,5.9069,0.0144,1.1334,2.2161,3.8826,3.9908,0.3413,1.6781,1.6284,1.9297,5.2877,0.0879,2.9438,2.4779,3.8494,7.4935,1.5308,3.1487,5.6592,4.7347,3.6849,7.6463,2.2467,4.0201,2.18,1.6659,5.2815,1.1654,0.5438,4.5186,5.597,1.205,5.9002,2.5866,1.1322,2.9915,1.0778,3.202,5.745,0.1525,4.4201,4.0927,4.4211,0.6218,4.2203,0.1216,4.7456,3.9059,5.0728,4.698,6.1879,0.5398,2.0205,0.0037,5.2266,0.1134,3.2525,1.4506,0.0001,4.2052,0.3197,5.077,0.3825,1.5462,1.3933,0.0009,1.9745,3.8542,4.1189,5.4856,3.6857,3.4919,4.3514,1.0959,0.8165,1.1292,0.165,4.2448,6.6303,4.5522,0.6971,5.8723,0.1407,2.0542,4.2387,0.8472,2.8684,5.9268,0.1211,4.5255,2.9988,0.5386,4.5888,3.0377,2.6115,3.0911,3.9335,0.5374,1.7086,0.0759,0.0001,5.7383,0.2107,1.1192,1.4527,6.6597,2.0911,1.5256,2.5595,4.6783,1.8609,2.8832,0.6588,0.8354,7.2241,0.1254,1.6321,2.338,3.9852,2.8209,2.1734,0.4679,1.0522,4.3695,0.1967,0.4858,1.0446,1.5797,3.4374,2.6212,1.7581,2.496,5.6037,0.0046,2.9745,3.7614,3.938,2.2515,2.9608,1.1979,4.6022,1.6464,5.5326,0.6278,2.8987,5.9828,3.3656,0.9006,2.2132,0.0002,4.4276,0.0674,3.6308,2.6305,0.1049,2.0404,0.8346,0.0002,3.0607,3.7944,3.3264,8.7721,1.9727,1.8117,3.3399,0.3041,3.0979,0.0046,0.6022,2.4194,1.3655,2.7778,4.8634,0.9638,0.4321,2.7988,2.363,1.4196,3.4276,3.0731,1.5929,2.6388,3.9822,4.8785,2.42,1.7051,0.4257,1.2982,2.6495,1.0701,0.8088,1.0509,3.3081,0.3232,0.0001,4.63,5.4746,1.662,1.8314,0.004,1.5226,0.0046,3.7401,4.1413,0.5097,5.121,0.4532,1.9049,1.646,5.0901,0.0021,4.6733,6.1243,1.3897,0.0001,0.2822,4.7574,0.3339,1.264,0.015,5.9665,1.9062,5.1305,3.9029,4.3799,0.255,0.745,0.1093,0.0,3.342,4.9746,1.1016,1.4102,3.0312,1.1674,1.877,0.0036,0.5282,0.6657,5.9357,3.866,0.6301,0.0136,1.6435,1.0974,1.326,0.4758,4.5846,1.095,4.6208,0.8499,5.0477,0.2804,2.7525,1.707,6.3499,1.0638,1.4098,1.5706,2.8536,1.7304,4.9733,1.2382,0.4851,4.0241,0.0004,2.8075,6.626,5.8666,0.4919,0.5488,1.6575,4.5757,0.0035,4.1026,5.4013,2.6858,5.9399,2.4034,0.4716,0.1284,0.0001,0.5141,7.2011,0.2853,0.0871,6.6085,0.4839,1.8867,1.2289,0.794,4.4257,2.1898,4.9233,5.3573,0.6057,2.9788,4.272,0.0027,0.4839,3.661,3.5902,3.4578,2.9696,0.6488,4.5296,0.0364,0.0267,0.2975,1.5599,5.5152,0.005,3.474,6.6862,3.0156,4.2134,1.3029,2.8659,1.8813,3.3999,0.3638,0.4219,0.5561,0.0002,2.8034,2.731,4.1627,4.5439,4.4699,0.7615,1.6254,2.8357,6.2412,2.5004,0.002,1.1971,1.7853,0.1064,0.0001,6.156,1.4134,0.9882,1.9292,0.3608,0.5604,4.9612,0.001,5.7327,4.1146,4.8476,1.1443,1.0079,0.7034,4.8701,5.8277,0.2571,0.7772,2.5369,5.0864,4.2356,5.4877,3.0262,2.2495,5.9058,0.1312,1.4002,4.2399,4.3143,0.0062,2.3473,1.1582,1.5593,5.2914,0.0053,5.1196,0.4233,3.6075,1.4348,0.0015,1.7102,3.2965,7.5645,1.0056,5.4348,3.2258,1.1051,3.3102,0.0072,1.5701,5.547,0.0209,3.9762,1.8915,2.4512,7.0937,0.0522,7.986,3.7933,3.5784,1.6674,0.4335,1.1331,4.4911,3.3077,5.069,0.8497,0.5626,3.8671,0.4039,0.7944,0.0008,0.001,4.4962,2.0126,6.6441,1.2016,1.0924,1.5045,0.6218,4.0334,0.3042,0.5951,3.3709,3.58,3.2717,5.2591,0.8751,4.1379,3.93,2.1082,2.0907,7.2301,1.6487,0.0015,0.0009,1.6118,2.5332,2.5154,0.4829,1.0637,1.1048,3.9731,4.2938,0.8082,0.1746,0.7845,0.3128,0.0001,1.4183,0.1087,4.5832,1.5723,3.5964,3.5944,4.8884,0.081,0.7044,1.4435,0.3978,4.8111,1.0183,0.0014,0.0005,2.2177,0.3859,0.058,3.4773,2.7685,0.0651,0.0039,1.9353,1.5553,0.6088,2.0334,1.4261,0.791,0.0001,3.1684,0.0171,0.0341,0.0002,5.5221,0.3991,2.8899,3.7473,1.2034,9.3106,0.7578,7.897,0.0062,0.0006,1.2552,0.469,5.0071,0.6406,2.0972,0.585,2.1469,4.429,0.0726,3.0921,0.9166,1.5703,3.6896,7.4884,2.0551,2.9457,2.2594,5.5202,0.6308,2.4542,3.9437,5.8103,1.5955,0.0021,0.0011,2.5855,0.4766,2.2786,3.5681,2.8862,0.7431,0.1273,0.6008,1.1693,2.2669,2.0626,0.1182,3.9558,1.5767,0.5568,5.1498,1.6801,6.6946,2.6925,2.0315,4.0345,0.9956,0.9115,0.2116,1.5453,1.707,6.2211,1.5912,0.5823,1.3014,0.001,0.0017,1.7501,3.8891,1.5313,2.3286,1.7195,2.9121,0.2864,0.0933,1.5994,1.108,2.3211,1.1119,2.4883,1.5994,1.9483,0.0003,5.8286,4.4049,4.0761,2.9424,3.8897,3.901,0.0011,0.3231,0.6464,1.4168,3.6608,0.0457,5.7768,3.5233,3.9064,2.6607,2.3343,2.6285,0.3815,4.7339,1.2128,2.7113,0.523,5.9473,5.9723,0.2315,4.1783,3.7799,0.0127,1.9131,0.5958,3.7301,1.3943,0.3402,5.9772,1.7063,2.3587,2.2975,4.6981,6.3086,1.0291,0.8565,0.2263,0.0627,2.3903,1.777,3.3595,0.0054,5.6683,3.8632,2.383,4.8605,0.1635,0.3327,3.5092,7.1616,0.9108,4.168,1.4602,1.1301,1.878,4.7481,0.0017,4.3362,0.0033,0.0018,0.0081,1.2655,0.685,3.5515,4.5451,4.7538,0

{"id":3977,"ended":false,"length":651,"text":"During his Senate campaign, Butler spoke out forcefully about the veterans bonus. Veterans of World War I, many of whom had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression, took to the streets to protest the government. Butler wrote a letter to Hoover in January, 1940, arguing that the Bonus Bill would have a terrible moral effect on Americans by making the government \"complicit in the crime of looting.\"  Butler spoke of the bill's \"paternalistic arrogance\" and said:\n\nI believe it will be the single greatest and most powerful rebuke that will ever be delivered to the government.\n\nHis prediction came true when veterans refused to turn in their cash bonuses. When the draft law had passed, but the cash bonus had not, Butler and his Senate colleague Robert Taft threatened to not vote for the measure until the bonus issue was resolved.  Butler argued that the bonus issue was a \"moral matter\", \"the final word in the matter of American ethics is to be spoken here\".  Butler was correct both times: there would be no more cash bonuses.  In 1941, Butler went so far as to say that Roosevelt had made a mistake in not repealing the Bonus Act.\n\nIn 1941, Butler and Taft, along with conservative Representative Harold B. Thomas of Oklahoma, filed a resolution, S. Res. 13, which called for Congress to make all World War I veterans veterans of the United States Army. S. Res. 13 was not enacted and therefore has no effect.\n\nIn 1943, Butler's resolution was also tabled when Roosevelt said that paying the veteran veterans was not on the nation's finances.  Roosevelt promised a program to be implemented by the end of 1943. In 1944, Roosevelt signed the G.I. Bill into law.\n\nButler died on August 6, 1949. President Harry S. Truman signed a bill posthumously awarding Butler the Congressional Gold Medal.\n\nHonors and legacy\n\nBecause of his efforts to repeal the G.I. Bill, it now has higher education benefits that allow for the children of GI's to attend college free of charge as veterans.  Butler's original intent had been to use this program for GIs to receive college degrees.\n\nCultural references\nButler is the subject of the song \"Bonus,\" written and sung by Harry Belafonte. Although Belafonte never met Butler, he took inspiration for the song from a poem that Butler wrote and read at the Lincoln Memorial during the Bonus March.  In a 1999 interview, Belafonte explained his choice of lyrics:\n\nOn July 30, 1947, the day before he died, Butler stood at President Truman's funeral and read the poem. On August 2, 1948, Butler died, making Truman the last living president to issue a posthumous Medal of Honor.\n\nA large plaque in front of the Gethsemane Baptist Church in Marion, North Carolina, states \"Here Lied Congressman William J. Butler and This is his Last Book of Proverbs.\"  Butler's last book of proverbs were published by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the same organization that later produced a biography of his life.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\"William J.

{"id":4770,"ended":false,"length":685,"text":"As a result of the vast stores of information made accessible on the web, one hundred critics pointed to a decrease in the desire to recall certain types of information, indicating, they considered that the web is increasingly likely to have an impact on the kind of information retained by people. These data are obtained from data gathered by two different online surveys in which a third party software is used through the internet (a Google Web Survey for those of the Google Group; the Microsoft Web Site Reliability Tool; the Google Consumer Panel; the Google AdWords Customer Panel).\n\nThis is one thing, but what is the impact of the Internet on one's mental faculties and how will this impact one's future self if you had to deal with the future by reading the Internet and not only by reading history as we do now? To find out what the Internet is doing on our brains, a team of experts from Columbia University led by Michael Gazzaniga decided to conduct an experiment in which they would examine the impact that the Internet has on our ability to identify our friends and family from their faces. The test would be known as \"the Faces of the Internet\" where the participants would have to identify their friends and family and to recognize whether the faces were familiar or not by being presented without the knowledge of the identity of the users. The researchers found that Internet access can cause a significant decrease in our ability to recognize faces as well as to identify our friends and family.\n\nWhile many people might think of the Internet as an invaluable tool that makes it easier for them to obtain information and communicate with other people, this does not necessarily mean that it also makes them smarter or more efficient. According to a group of scientists from Columbia University in New York, the Internet has actually a detrimental impact on our brain. As a matter of fact, they also noticed that the Internet made many users forget some of their learning. For instance, as we already know, the brain tends to learn and remember certain pieces of information. However, according to Gazzaniga, these lessons are rapidly forgetten if the people are heavily browsing the Internet. He also stated that even people who do not have problems with their short-term memory may still become forgetful if they have enough time to use the Internet, while the amount of time that they would spend on it actually diminishes their capacity to remember things for an extended period of time.\n\nInternet can be a great source of knowledge, but, if you spend a lot of time looking at it or reading on it, chances are much that you won't remember a thing that you learned from it. So, in your daily life, you need to find a balance and you should limit the time you use the Internet.

{"id":2764,"ended":false,"length":655,"text":"In nearby objects ( within our Milky Way galaxy ) observed redshifts are almost always related to the line @ - @ of @ - @ sight velocities associated with the objects being observed.\n\nThe relation is almost always proportional to the number of quasars involved.\n\nIn general, @ - @ sight velocities are lower than those observed by @ - @ in their host galaxies ( @ - @ being the velocities @ + @ the quasar ).\n\nFrom @ observations, @ - @ in general can be determined very accurately.\n\nThis is because, @ - @ and @ - @ are measured with nearly the same precision and only depend on the distance between observer and object ( @ - @ ).\n\nBut there are observations where it isn't possible to use @ - @ to determine @ - @ ; one example has been previously considered ( @ - @ \u226a @ - @ ) and another example is the so-called \"invisible\" quasars ( redshift \u226a 0 or = - 0 ), which may have been observed @ + @ or 0 but there is no information on @ - @.\n\nHowever, it should first be noted that, even if there is sufficient information about @ - @ the distance, it may still not be possible to determine @ - @. The reason for this is as follows:\n\nAssume that, @ + @ is the speed at which the quasar appears to be moving in its host galaxy and @ - @ is the speed at which it appears to be moving in the nearby object.\n\nIt can be assumed that @ - @ ~ = @ - @ ( @ - @ = @ - @ ) since @ - @ in the host galaxy and the nearby object will be identical.\n\nThis causes @ - @ to be equal to @ - @ = @ - @ when @ + @ \u226b @ - @.\n\nFrom the equation @ - @, @ - @ ~ = @ - @ => @ - @ ~ = @ - @.\n\nThis means that we are stuck with equation @ - @.\n\nIt is important to note that, no matter what, it is clear that @ - @ ~ \u226a @ - @.\n\nThe @ is the most likely source of the observed redshift.\n\nIf we consider, the probability that an extra (blue) photon is created with each light particle at the level @ = + @.\n\n( @ - @\/@ = @ - @ = @ - @)\n\nThe probability of this extra photon being observed @ = = + @ is then expressed as below.\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}^T\\frac{N}{V}\\sum_T\\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{1}{2}^T\\frac{N^2\/V^4}\\sum_T\\frac{N}{V}$$\n\nSubstituting the terms and then rearranging, we obtain a similar expression for the probability of the extra light particle having a red shift equal to. In particular,, which can be verified from the equations,. Here again, we note that is possible if the extra light particle is emitted from the center of mass of the pair, which is unlikely because this would violate conservation of energy.\n\nThis is a special case of the general situation. If we assume a large enough difference between the red shift of the object and the light emitted from it, and an average distance between stars of the galaxies of, then we obtain the following

{"id":2453,"ended":true,"length":650,"text":"Prosperity churches place a strong emphasis on the importance of giving. Some services include a teaching time focused on giving and prosperity, including Biblical references to tithing ; and then a sermon on the topic of money. As Prosperity churches are growing in popularity, they have also been accused of being deceptive.\n\nProsperity Christian churches are also known as Prosperity Gospel churches or Prosperity churches. Prosperity Christian Churches can be found in every country across the world. Prosperity churches typically believe that wealth will result from giving, and that these are provided through God. They will also teach that if one is saved, and give through tithing, they will receive wealth as a reward.\n\nProsperity Christian churches are part of a larger group of Prosperity and prosperity teachings. Prosperity teachings are based on the idea that if one is righteous, God will provide good health. Prosperity teachings often include a \"Law of Abraham \" premise that tithing should be given, in the belief that by giving to God in faith, one will receive blessings and good fortune.\n\nProsperity churches can also teach that by giving to God in faith, one will experience good health. The belief that good and prosperity come through faith in God is a fundamental part of prosperity religions.\n\nProsperity churches often teach that one will prosper through tithing. However, as Prosperity Christian churches grow in popularity around the world, they have been accused of being deceptive. Critics state that Prosperity Christian Churches are essentially scams.\n\nMany Prosperity Christian churches are also associated with the Prosperity Gospel, a variant of Christianity that teaches that good and prosperity come from faith in God. Many Prosperity churches will also teach that in order to obtain wealth, one must give to the church in order to receive blessings. Prosperity churches also teach that if one is saved, and give to the church through tithing, they will obtain the good fortune promised by the Prosperity gospel.\n\nThe Prosperity Gospel of Prosperity Christian churches is based on the idea that prosperity is a result of faith in God. Many Prosperity churches teach that money, and even good health, come in the form of \"miracles \".\n\nProsperity Gospel churches often require tithing through the Prosperity Gospel. According to the Prosperity gospel, God provides rewards as a result of tithing.\n\nProsperity churches can be part of a larger group of Prosperity and prosperity teachings, including the Prosperity\/ Prosperity Gospel and Prosperity churches. Many Prosperity teachings are in a similar vein as the Prosperity gospel.\n\nWhile Prosperity churches have not typically been connected to violence and hate, they have been associated with deception and fraud. In the case of Prosperity Christian churches, they have been accused of teaching bad financial advice, and scams, by teaching people to give a lot of money without expecting good rewards or benefits from those donations.\n\nA prominent example of this is televangelist and founder of the Jim Bakker \"New Life Church,\" who was convicted in 2007 for fraudulently selling \" Silver Solution \", a chemical solution that Bakker claimed was a cure for HIV infection.\n\nPeople do find Prosperity Christian churches to be helpful in improving their financial health. For this reason, some people are unlikely to criticize Prosperity Christian churches. However, Prosperity Christian churches, and the Prosperity Gospel, have been criticised by a variety of people as being false, based on their teachings and practices, or because they seem to promote greed and the exploitation of people in the name of religious faith.","token_len":730,"entropy":[8.0378,1.1249,14.0834,8.19,1.7058,3.4322,0.059,0.0224,1.9683,2.5337,0.0418,5.6481,3.9651,4.5796,6.254,2.831,2.8243,7.3585,5.4141,6.9317,0.1101,4.8127,1.6676,9.816,1.8419,4.9274,8.3129,5.3367,1.6792,8.3593,0.0086,11.0938,2.3118,6.6191,1.7849,4.5282,2.4451,1.6976,4.0914,0.519,4.1715,1.1256,4.9466,9.5507,0.009,1.0052,2.5657,6.2783,1.7222,0.724,0.4609,1.3403,2.2339,2.6296,2.3085,5.9798,0.0765,1.7201,6.061,1.3456,1.4133,0.0085,6.6425,0.0023,0.0012,4.6004,2.9525,1.7689,3.3947,1.6267,1.5954,6.5261,0.0467,6.06,0.7011,3.1222,1.3386,0.0102,3.5879,1.0095,2.389,0.0013,2.0586,4.8464,4.9064,0.7239,1.0763,0.7077,4.0778,3.5221,4.6341,0.1297,1.2923,0.7235,2.4391,0.0004,1.6644,5.0132,5.0395,0.7141,5.1418,3.9875,5.2255,0.3995,3.2109,1.5466,1.2909,1.5313,5.4055,3.3431,7.6725,3.3277,4.1158,2.1818,2.0607,4.7245,1.7214,3.6938,0.6814,4.1182,3.4907,2.1287,4.7517,0.7655,4.4349,8.718,4.6919,8.121,0.0006,0.3411,2.5134,0.3056,1.8347,4.5437,4.0024,1.6082,1.2178,0.8421,1.4384,0.0002,1.846,0.0006,0.0016,1.6093,0.6683,1.2262,6.2529,0.0407,1.3314,2.067,2.9779,0.3617,3.4838,0.0016,5.3159,5.7437,9.0306,1.0898,2.0288,0.0011,4.5368,1.3443,2.9168,0.2227,1.2037,2.8185,0.1874,3.2802,0.7572,1.0831,4.1896,0.4467,2.7337,0.2942,3.7271,4.0784,6.343,4.3549,1.5053,0.001,1.2711,3.7699,1.7662,2.0938,4.4169,7.4092,0.2667,8.4178,7.8958,11.4356,1.4017,5.702,0.0015,2.9182,0.4276,2.3324,3.4058,4.2898,3.136,2.8153,0.0287,5.389,0.5718,3.1382,2.5558,4.3003,4.5796,0.5321,0.4849,0.8542,1.605,3.7829,2.6713,4.6492,2.9926,0.2487,0.8744,0.0002,1.2401,0.0004,0.0015,2.573,3.4872,0.9426,3.5614,0.669,4.6648,0.7479,1.3863,0.1999,0.8211,0.2702,0.1319,0.0728,0.1967,6.7775,2.3823,0.634,0.7484,2.9232,3.7668,0.6075,3.6184,5.7647,5.4235,2.4656,2.372,3.4358,1.3549,1.3072,0.6941,2.4465,4.1658,1.2345,0.0016,4.8057,7.3208,0.4747,1.0534,0.0002,0.8928,0.0003,0.0014,1.3899,2.9449,2.3946,0.2425,3.6158,3.8309,6.4338,2.6687,2.8253,0.0046,0.8757,2.6885,0.0129,4.3247,1.5239,0.0006,3.0099,0.2332,0.73,0.8216,0.0408,6.3989,0.0092,0.0907,0.0756,0.8621,1.6615,1.8934,0.1704,0.0265,0.7034,0.0857,0.3137,8.478,6.871,0.085,1.9416,0.0007,1.6385,5.6577,0.7859,5.702,4.5137,1.2724,0.9019,0.0002,4.9638,0.5557,0.0015,1.1634,0.2828,1.5557,2.6322,5.0392,0.0173,1.8567,5.871,0.0135,1.883,3.2047,1.6267,7.1681,0.1134,2.6635,0.8321,2.728,0.4608,4.4437,0.9065,0.2379,0.1654,1.4392,4.0292,0.3142,0.1306,0.2138,4.837,0.1657,0.0011,2.172,4.8989,2.0226,1.0103,0.1343,4.345,1.0131,0.1601,3.3283,1.2791,0.3633,0.1211,0.4338,1.1533,1.1927,3.9546,2.7571,2.6275,1.6985,0.0414,0.8568,2.4194,0.8441,2.4302,0.001,2.2585,1.9209,1.5916,0.0679,1.8235,0.1416,0.5371,1.2632,0.1998,0.2445,0.2571,4.5886,2.0667,0.0086,0.9287,0.2889,0.0029,0.0286,0.2537,0.1006,5.8972,4.1023,3.8973,0.4277,4.9977,0.5692,2.0394,8.7122,0.0034,1.7892,0.1722,0.2438,0.0002,3.0829,0.9041,0.0012,0.6374,3.6194,1.7841,0.0022,2.5922,0.3871,2.8165,2.3955,0.1255,0.5703,1.3275,0.0951,5.9769,2.1638,2.172,3.0463,0.1035,2.7975,0.1071,0.1063,0.4604,4.9748,0.0884,0.0018,1.3513,2.9797,0.0647,4.0529,3.3055,2.8482,3.9072,3.1977,2.2748,0.095,0.897,4.8412,1.017,0.1159,0.002,5.3479,8.1862,0.0447,9.4775,2.2788,0.0002,1.2159,0.0004,0.0012,1.937,0.5991,2.5669,6.3567,4.2617,0.0049,6.6352,2.1964,4.3931,0.0006,1.3157,0.9639,4.7799,0.0009,1.2562,0.1827,0.0004,2.9478,0.1295,3.7731,3.2817,5.4565,4.8626,0.5773,1.9011,0.0183,1.898,0.0031,0.8491,2.0413,0.0002,0.7317,0.0002,0.0012,2.4382,2.7885,1.4067,7.4076,0.0035,0.5108,0.3401,0.2104,0.0692,0.027,0.0011,0.3083,0.0101,0.1394,3.4873,2.4278,1.9584,0.1522,0.0021,7.9941,4.4732,0.0043,1.6518,4.2539,0.3844,0.0017,6.193,0.8892,5.0684,0.024,0.0019,3.4801,1.2323,5.6033,3.1841,2.645,0.6793,1.9999,2.0149,0.0049,0.0008,2.2601,1.0978,1.0765,0.0001,5.8148,0.5814,0.0019,1.5571,2.7669,4.2869,6.8813,0.8441,6.4383,0.4418,8.4831,3.1818,4.3479,1.4383,1.0856,1.455,1.2059,2.1258,0.0297,8.8518,0.8556,4.1371,0.449,3.3695,2.199,2.1719,0.0019,0.3464,0.0008,1.5187,0.1167,0.0722,1.9761,2.0781,1.0835,0.4528,0.0248,5.5427,6.5015,6.9259,0.9173,1.663,1.4531,7.2343,2.6157,4.5769,3.9045,3.6448,0.856,1.5837,4.8747,2.5704,0.5936,0.1491,4.0118,4.4783,3.0641,6.4661,3.7522,4.0879,2.3457,5.2032,5.4251,0.0551,0.3271,0.0002,3.9483,6.5703,2.4212,0.1101,2.1323,1.1916,9.6085,0.0004,0.0405,2.1285,4.5773,0.5417,0.8032,9.6547,4.2804,0.0064,6.3937,5.8107,4.5497,2.351,3.0891,2.0242,2.3785,1.9314,1.629,3.6392,1.7213,2.7202,2.1915,0.0001,3.2823,3.9807,14.7602,9.6936,5.283,0.6647,8.4124,4.3692,1.0984,10.8445,0.0037,2.2378,1.2467,2.4762,1.1922,0.0435,3.9859,3.1437,0.2726,1.4336,0.0002,7.0556,5.8962,6.3537,2.2107,0.0014,1.0991,0.1409,1.2291,0.0604,5.6006,1.4013,5.271,0.4856,3.0297,2.997,0.7637,3.6454,5.5423,0.083,0.0716,3.073,2.3213,2.7195,8.8898,0.0072,5.7873,0.9607,0.0007,0.8207,0.0673,2.1522,2.0971,0.0071,3.7468,0.001,0.8276,0.1623,4.3793,3.0899,2.716,0.2768,0.0005,0.8226,1.0467,2.1365,1.0025,6.0763,1.9132,3.7713,2.3303,0.0009,1.4565,3.4006,0.6407,5.144,2.0323,6.7886,0.1112,2.5826,3.3686,1.9829,3.0759,2.3756,2.6031,2.981,0.6622,5.0394,0.2899,3.9058,5.3832,1.1385,4

{"id":4350,"ended":true,"length":676,"text":"Singapore argued that in 1847 Pedra Branca was terra nullius ( Latin for `` land belonging to no one `` ) as it had never been the subject of a prior claim or manifestation of sovereignty. The Court agreed, ruling that Pedra Branca was `` a barren rock, or rather a large rock, having no visible means of support above water-level, having no apparent form of existence of interest capable of being claimed, and no evidence of the possession by any civilized people of the means to exercise a dominion, whether of sovereignty, or protection, over water. `` At the time of the case, and for decades afterwards, Singapore had not been colonized and only two ships were believed to have visited the area from 1850 to 1860. The only evidence showing that there was any civilization in the area at the time was a Spanish vessel named La Concepcion that was wrecked at Pedra Branca in 1848. The ship remained anchored in the area until 1854 when it was abandoned due to the lack of supplies and in order to protect the crew. Singapore claimed that Pedra Branca was also terra nullius given that it had no known historic or archaeological evidence or any other form of evidence of human and civil activity in the area. It was the second known instance of a shipwreck on Pedra Branca. The court went on to say as well that ''...a bare rock, an isolated island in the middle of nowhere, is not worth a drop of blood; there being so much more productive land to obtain an abode on... `` To this, many of the other European nations responded that the location was indeed on the edge of the South China Sea between a chain of islands that belonged to their own nation. In the midst of the heated debate over the ownership of Pedra Branca, the Chinese began to build a temple in the area of the wreck. The Chinese ship that was found on Pedra Branca had sailed to Singapore from Canton in 1841 carrying around 600 immigrants and traders from Guangzhou, who had been contracted by Sir Stamford Raffles to establish a trading post in Singapore. The Chinese were given land for their buildings on Pedrabranca. The Chinese temple was completed on 16 December 1854 at the site of the wreck, where the bodies of some of the Chinese passengers and crew were scattered and buried. While most of the ship's cargo was salvaged it was later learned that some of the bodies and the original treasure, including silver, gold, and porcelain, had been removed by the Chinese. This led to a disagreement in 1860 between the Chinese and the Portuguese and the Malays. By then however, the Chinese already knew that the site was occupied. In the end, the Chinese and Portuguese who had the longest standing claims ended up making agreements over the area. When the disputes escalated into open warfare in 1867, King George V of England intervened to resolve the dispute between the Chinese and Portuguese.\n\nIn the mid 1920s, during the Japanese occupation and the early decades of the Cold War, the area served as an emergency military base for Japan. Today, Pedra Branca plays an important role in the territorial disputes between China, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore over the South China Sea area, and the U-shaped island is also a symbol of Singapore's claim to sovereignty over the region. Pedra Branca is uninhabited yet has an elevation of about 50 meters above the water level and therefore has a very high strategic value as a high-tech platform for surveillance. However, it is still regarded as a military base in the

{"id":3052,"ended":true,"length":628,"text":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) is caused by a new type of coronavirus. Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this new virus were surprising. As of January 25, 2008, a total of 8,086 cases were reported by the Chinese authorities (a total that was probably underestimated), including 774 deaths (1).\n\nThe virus was originally identified in an employee of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Centre at the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, Hong Kong (2), and was known as the H1N1\u2013specific SARS-CoV. Subsequent research revealed that only two other isolates were similar to this virus, but these were isolated too late to contribute to scientific and clinical understanding of the disease. The virus was characterized by whole-genome sequencing, nucleotide variation analysis, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses, as revealed by the complete and partially sequenced genomes (2).\n\nCharacterized by both a large genome and large RNA payload.\n\nThe full extent of genome size was not revealed with the available sequences because the viral genomes had been subcutaneously transduced to insect eggs, where the full size can be measured (2\u20134).\n\nThis feature is supported by the detection of a single gene in which more than 300 amino acids\u2014the length of six full-length proteins\u2014were transcribed to mRNA (5). This gene appears to encode a protein of 745 amino acids, almost twice the size of many of the other predicted proteins. Since the genome was completely expressed in insect cells, the size of the protein could be the same or larger in humans.\n\nThe highly polymorphic viruses were identified by the detection of more than 60 different restriction fragments in the full complete and partially sequenced genomes (2\u20134). These fragments showed a high degree of nucleotide diversity, indicating that the viral genome is well organized (6\u201310). The phylogenetic support for the viruses was low at only 17 %, indicating that they did not diverge very rapidly from each other.\n\nDividing genes into smaller domains.\n\nA conserved signature of genetic variation at the base of the viral genome, as revealed by the full and partial genomes, is the presence of multiple \u201ccoding regions\u201d separated from one another by a noncoding region, which has been characterized as a \u201cglossary\u201d of genomic regions that encode distinct and independent virulence genes (6, 7). This \u201ccoding region signature\u201d is seen in most coronaviruses, including those that cause common colds. In SARS-CoV viruses, the C-terminal half of the genomic region contains genes encoding the receptor-binding domain ( RBD ), the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) protein, and an outer structural protein. The RBD and ECM domains were identified by RFLP analysis and show high genetic diversity (6, 8, 10). As an additional indication of organization within the genome, these genes have been shown to be arranged in two separate chromosomal sequences, as determined by analysis of the partial sequences (11). This configuration was further supported by the observation that the ECM protein is translated differently in each of the partial sequence segments.\n\nThe genome of a small, highly contagious, and highly pathogenic virus is an enigma. The discovery of an unusual organization of genes and the detection of polymorphic genes suggest that the genome might have originated from a new virus

{"id":4848,"ended":true,"length":639,"text":"In the duet for soprano and alto, `` Wenn Sorgen auf mich dringen `` ( When cares press upon me ), in `` bright E major ``, as the Bach scholar Christoph Schmidt explains, the chorale ends with an extended cadential cadence -- an F-sharp -- that sounds as if its being `` lifted `` off of the chord by the alto `` as it rises to an A-flat on the soprano; the F-sharp `` sinks back again to the original note, then rises again to the A-sharp.\n\nThis is one of the few times in the vocal music of Bach that one can hear a chord played as a melodic line -- an F-sharp on the bass, that is -- as in the familiar `` B flat minor ``. The alto voice may then be thought of in some measure as its vocal equivalent. As we shall see further on, in much chorale music of Bach's there is often an element of the melodic line in the form of an arpeggiated chord in addition to the chorale melody.\n\nThe words of the chorale are sometimes difficult or misleading for our present use, as indicated by the question mark in the title of the work, as well as by the words ``Wenn``. `` Wie sei es mit sich und mit mir ``, which would mean `` How is it with you and with me ``, is frequently heard in the present duet as `` Wenn michs Sorgen sein `` ( When my cares press upon me ). But to understand the text one probably must regard the question mark ( a variant spelling of the word `? ` ) in the title as a symbol of uncertainty rather than of doubt. The words `` Wie` sind es mit euch und mit mir ``, when referring to the alto, express a more definite doubt ( what can `they ` be referring to? ).\n\nThe soprano voice can be regarded as the source whence comes the melody of the alto, and the alto, in turn, is its vocal equivalent. This is not in the same sense one may speak of voice as being a vocal equivalent of any other musical tone, as is the case in jazz music. The duet expresses the idea that the alto has been lifted -- like a feather -- by the soprano, which has reached the highest point, that of the aria, and which has now brought it down again. In any case, there is no indication of a melodic relationship of the type we are used to in jazz; here the chorded line is used as part of the alto melody -- we have in the chorale the kind of cadence that often serves as a point of departure in a jazz melody.\n\nIn the introduction to the chorale, as well as in the first stanza of this duet, an F-sharp in the bass and then an A-sharp appear. But in both instances, these chords are themselves in harmony with the melody of the alto; they are, in other words, `` lifted ``. Here again these chords serve as points of departure. This is probably the most remarkable development which we find in this work, which is otherwise essentially a conventional reworking of traditional chorale forms. In the case of both the alto melody and the chorale melody, we hear ( in common with much chorale music of the past century ) a chorale line played as a melodic line.","token_len":734,"entropy":[2.6222,11.8325,1.2228,4.851,7.8974,3.3337,0.4816,2.9384,6.4131,0.0085,1.0696,12.0955,10.4582,6.6139,7.1263,6.0096,1.12,5.2688,1.0987,5.5739,1.013,7.6698,7.8092,6.9321,1.7321,10.9202,13.9536,10.0093,6.6863,3.6517,8.1643,4.2201,7.2807,12.4061,6.5976,11.273,5.1436,2.2943,4.2733,2.5693,9.2755,7.8892,9.2628,0.6227,6.361,4.1676,1.0587,1.7924,5.9405,0.6608,2.1674,5.3201,1.1901,3.0801,4.9872,5.5776,3.7321,3.2668,0.1669,6.5256,3.3689,8.0306,2.3498,2.7121,3.7622,2.0339,4.703,3.4636,0.5873,5.1971,6.2367,6.7374,7.559,3.4689,2.6141,3.002,0.6915,5.6858,4.447,2.0042,6.8538,0.0047,5.226,4.5115,2.9626,4.5825,2.4361,3.3808,2.6632,0.4208,2.1852,5.1277,0.4899,5.3949,0.032,0.0009,4.98,1.8348,4.3059,0.3279,0.2086,4.4897,8.137,3.1024,5.4668,1.3688,0.7541,4.5205,3.9859,1.5721,3.9243,2.4016,0.5813,0.824,0.968,2.2795,0.0971,4.3194,2.1621,2.9227,0.0508,3.7547,1.6995,4.2607,0.479,0.4308,3.613,3.4764,1.3966,1.0557,7.0493,5.2293,1.9572,2.6757,0.7204,4.2031,1.5249,1.9725,1.908,4.2329,6.5559,2.992,1.1805,5.9364,0.0725,4.1839,3.4554,3.6067,2.171,0.2124,0.1335,3.3537,0.6512,4.9729,1.5425,6.3767,1.0846,3.493,2.6835,3.8225,0.7995,9.0511,3.8151,4.9224,6.5955,8.8114,1.6702,1.2357,2.0097,5.6889,0.002,7.087,4.9645,5.1469,0.8748,5.3857,0.1841,2.9601,4.8044,4.8011,0.2648,5.4791,6.7767,3.9077,1.802,4.079,3.4721,1.8351,0.0857,5.3841,2.2648,0.2675,3.1387,6.6551,6.8527,0.5063,0.8954,2.4826,4.4115,1.9788,3.8518,10.0114,0.5538,3.552,1.884,4.2629,0.0577,2.8376,3.3784,0.0258,1.4503,2.6682,0.7851,3.5915,0.0309,2.1351,6.1039,0.0502,0.0007,3.0192,3.4499,3.4716,4.8883,0.0062,0.6991,4.2336,0.0382,0.0566,4.6497,0.7144,1.4497,0.0003,1.7529,7.527,2.2478,1.0036,2.8962,0.0643,0.0466,1.69,4.081,6.6157,5.4031,5.1513,2.9869,4.8674,2.9197,5.0673,1.479,2.5909,6.1707,0.1778,0.489,5.7766,2.693,1.9866,0.4391,3.4897,1.0131,0.7815,5.7311,1.9369,4.4675,1.7924,0.0143,1.3327,0.3822,4.8316,2.1556,3.9364,0.2903,8.1323,4.256,5.3358,1.2796,8.4936,4.7011,3.277,6.3496,5.4626,3.6451,1.0615,5.9072,4.8264,4.2142,8.9613,2.251,3.1051,4.8015,2.5669,1.6431,7.2957,3.4671,1.2937,4.9599,2.7231,3.0398,1.6998,1.8539,4.3849,1.6659,2.6281,5.4602,5.5589,0.9115,0.9588,7.3923,6.4087,0.0083,3.4624,1.813,2.0522,0.4717,5.285,0.1356,6.767,6.354,0.9525,0.0431,4.5687,2.5177,1.2554,1.9596,1.88,6.3834,8.7764,0.8105,0.2145,0.0979,1.9441,3.6536,4.9199,3.2614,0.9077,5.9688,5.4911,8.314,2.5103,5.9117,0.9022,3.7279,0.1811,4.3202,5.6462,7.9595,5.8051,0.8438,0.4344,2.3762,4.2296,5.6451,2.9215,2.7712,2.1055,0.3193,0.4077,1.2407,1.7807,5.1874,0.6844,7.2881,4.4117,0.0047,2.3521,6.9794,0.3808,2.1506,5.4048,2.8405,1.3316,4.4959,5.4654,5.1045,1.0178,5.6522,1.8339,6.2672,5.2796,5.1001,2.5767,0.7188,1.7438,1.0792,5.738,7.4794,0.0336,0.7515,5.2081,0.0014,1.9913,6.5872,2.061,4.3142,2.5837,4.9532,4.4651,7.2054,4.3118,6.2237,7.5701,4.6873,4.9989,5.665,0.0545,2.3905,1.1216,1.8803,0.0002,1.6536,5.8858,0.0278,0.0079,2.2425,3.5849,1.0267,4.3705,0.4075,1.9351,4.6097,10.303,8.0001,0.2927,4.6935,1.5061,0.4824,3.7854,0.0028,1.4671,1.7995,1.887,3.2421,0.0026,4.107,1.9482,3.0139,0.0343,1.4017,4.6826,5.6237,0.8152,0.3495,3.4287,1.0308,2.7393,4.7465,1.7757,2.6122,0.6635,8.4672,2.3111,4.7699,0.2449,7.7058,3.2449,3.3544,1.7512,5.6586,1.6798,1.3827,5.4673,0.305,3.8845,5.8782,1.591,2.3413,2.8748,1.7722,0.076,1.5211,5.3279,2.7824,0.7399,1.6329,8.0065,0.007,6.8014,1.1915,4.2562,1.4499,1.067,2.7829,0.0035,3.4166,2.6786,6.2711,5.4128,5.447,2.4689,7.5109,1.4457,2.2019,0.4104,4.9101,0.0036,0.0043,1.5722,3.1935,4.0968,5.2701,1.3342,4.6659,1.6691,3.2899,3.7272,3.8421,0.9868,6.1892,1.8694,1.4226,1.9587,3.5144,2.4222,4.1126,6.7524,2.7078,2.6583,2.9006,1.5465,2.6095,4.7546,0.2899,0.3384,3.7525,0.4988,0.8229,4.6961,1.3665,1.8521,5.7199,0.0144,5.6177,3.4751,0.6843,8.7061,3.193,1.9103,4.7152,0.0069,1.3302,4.0378,4.4934,6.0894,1.5664,5.6373,6.8853,3.4502,0.9435,4.8903,1.1399,5.1542,0.0122,0.3715,4.3826,0.0043,2.2102,3.4738,6.0215,2.8997,5.1818,1.5,3.3613,0.0415,0.0139,1.5715,6.7801,0.0346,6.8807,0.6612,1.4785,6.3199,5.948,0.4701,1.0871,5.6921,0.4055,1.9557,2.8201,2.0617,4.0777,1.9417,0.5433,0.9624,0.0002,2.469,0.9859,5.3384,0.4586,0.7886,3.503,0.0485,0.0134,0.9407,4.5478,2.6165,0.0092,0.676,0.4447,3.8428,6.3721,0.0798,0.6306,4.3321,3.5215,0.0012,0.1791,5.3393,5.2857,0.2119,0.0853,4.266,0.4015,4.3476,3.6204,4.8919,2.1733,0.6074,0.0262,1.369,6.8963,1.7872,3.8882,2.2179,4.5615,3.2934,1.0928,4.3274,3.8936,0.6876,7.2872,3.7952,4.0375,0.7465,0.6337,2.6394,2.0567,0.07,1.3204,0.0027,2.661,2.595,0.6905,3.4746,1.3775,3.4155,0.0627,0.0035,5.348,7.4605,1.5306,3.9891,4.7488,3.334,6.0799,0.9036,4.1878,0.4197,3.3753,0.0703,0.1378,2.2774,3.567,0.9427,4.9648,1.4623,1.7001,4.5453,4.895,5.268,2.8248,3.2388,0.2797,3.467,1.4234,1.6075,3.0451,1.6226,8.0078,5.7359,1.2255,7.1836,6.7525,2.4189,0.1011,5.3823,1.3752,0.0161,0.3549,5.6847,0.4566,2.8737,1.2916,4.2011,0.0727,5.0724,1.2922,2.1874,0.0015,4.6192,0.0896,0.1968,1.2845,0.0153,0.0037,2.021,0.4994,2.8584,4.2375,6.0692,3.5696,6.9911,1.9968,5.7118,1.9002,0.0184,0.0423,0.2288,1.5512,0.557,2.9616,3.3

{"id":67,"ended":true,"length":694,"text":"All of the novel's storylines concern memory in some sense or another. The most apparent confrontation of memory is on the part of Urania Cabral, who has returned to the Dominican Republic in the midst of the crisis between the US and Cuba. She is soon implicated in the murder of a US citizen, causing her to flee back to New York in time to save the life of an acquaintance of her father, a famous historian. Although this narrative is mostly concerned with Urania's personal memory loss and the effect it has on her relationship, it nevertheless contains a powerful exploration of the different kinds of memory, and how they are related to and manipulated by others.In's novel, one of the main characters is the mysterious Dr. Nalini Malinowski, and the narrator is often described in the form of a first person's point-of-view narration. The narrative begins with a flashback to a scene in a restaurant in the Santo Domingo in which Malinowski is seen speaking with her husband, who is a famous psychiatrist and the author of many books. The wife's memory is gradually faded by Alzheimer's disease. She can remember a certain time only vaguely - and only certain aspects of that time. At another point, Urania describes her memory like this: \"I could remember only the past that was important to me.\" However, she is still able to retain her memories of how important relationships were, although this ability to hold onto one's memories of people fades as her condition worsens.Malinowski's husband, when he realizes of the illness, takes away her keys to their house. He does that so she can no longer leave the apartment by her own. The loss of her access to her house makes the reader think of the loss of access to one's memory, such as it is. The narrator describes many instances of Urania's forgetting what she had intended to tell the daughter she saw on TV. It seems as though Urania is trying to create a narrative through her memories, which she then forgets. She gets tangled along her own path - one in which she is herself an important character - and can't quite find the path she wants to take. The plot then focuses on the story of the murdered American, and the story of Urania's acquaintance in the Dominican Republic and New York. The narration shifts between the lives of these two characters. It alternates between Urania at various points in her relationship with both of these people. In a short chapter titled \" My Dream of You \", the narrator describes Urania's dream of her mother, who has recently died. This dream is a key piece of evidence in revealing Urania's past which the narrator keeps hidden from her. What made the narrator choose this short chapter? The answer is the same point-of-view narration in which Urania remembers her mother's death. The narrator's choice of a dream as one of the most dramatic examples of memory reveals the way memory can be a dreamlike state and can be manipulated. As Urania has amnesia, the narrator keeps her memories hidden from her. At the end of the story, the narrator tells Urania, \"Your memory is mine\". How does the narrator's memory reveal the past? The narrator explains this as \"your past is my past\". The past may seem like a dream, but it is still a reality. It was Urania's and the narrator's past.

{"id":3518,"ended":true,"length":670,"text":"By the end of the 1840s, Greeley's Tribune was not only solidly established in New York as a daily paper, it was highly influential nationally through its weekly edition, which circulated in the United States and Canada. The first edition of the weekly appeared on December 18, 1840, and at the time, its main distribution method was via mail-order by subscription. Although it only carried \"local\" news (i.e. of the city of Chicago ), it also contained the \"Chicago Tribune\" name, and thus helped to define the city and make it known as the \"Crossroads of the West\". In later years it was published twice a week, but even then only contained local news. One of Greeley's most influential writings,The Open Door. In 1848, he published his most politically influential book : The Politician as Machine Politician (popularly known as Machine Politics ), a biting indictment of the New York City political machine.\n\nGreeley is widely considered to be the most influential reporter of the period. The Tribune soon became regarded as the leading newspaper of the Midwest, which prompted the Chicago press to call Greeley \"the Father of Chicago \" - and Chicago and Illinois became well known as the political center of the country\n\nGreeley's Tribune was the first major newspaper to challenge the \"Boss\" system of patronage (i.e. the system in New York where power was held by political bosses who selected their members out of a local patronage society). Greeley's newspaper exposed corruption and graft in the city of Chicago. However, this brought the wrath of the powerful Republican boss and Chicago-area senator Richard Oglesby. He responded to The Tribune's criticism of him by exposing the Tribune and Greeley's other newspaper, The World, as \"Muckrakers.\"\n\nThe feud between Oglesby and Greeley dominated national political discourse for years. When Oglesby refused to return Greeley's call, Greeley left Chicago for Washington, D.C., where he took a job as editor of Harper's Weekly. But even once in Washington, Greeley clashed with the \"Boss,\" refusing to bow to his blackmail demands. Even during Greeley's time as editor of Harper's Weekly he continued to publish The Tribune, and his newspaper became the biggest source of political news. This eventually led to charges of libel against Greeley from Oglesby, who eventually won a $3,000 jury award against him. In 1853, Greeley won a $300,000 verdict against Oglesby.\n\nWhile writing The Times, Greeley became extremely ill and was confined to bed for the first time in years. His illness led to the publication of the most powerful editorial his paper ever published : The Times, \"The Manx\", and the Open Door. In the editorial, Greeley announced that he would leave the Tribune to the editors he had recommended during his illness. When he recovered and returned to his newspaper, he did not have an editor in waiting - nor had his editors ever met him. Greeley resigned as editor of The Tribune and turned over editorial control of the paper to his successor, Charles Whittlesea. The editors, while loyal to Greeley, recognized that he was not well and therefore he did not know how his newspaper should be edited, and what he did know was outdated and irrelevant by the time his successor got to Chicago from Baltimore.

{"id":3301,"ended":true,"length":682,"text":"In 1897, before the revolution in design brought about by HMS Dreadnought, the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and 50 over Germany. The United Kingdom, France and Russia were the largest powers, and three of the four, the United Kingdom, France and Russia, made up the Triple Entente, while the fourth, Germany, was the leading naval power in Europe. Their rivalry was the background for the beginning of World War I.\n\nIn 1901, Great Britain, France, Japan, Norway, Russia and Portugal agreed to support the defense of the Iberian peninsula, and in 1905 they established the Madrid Conference to solve the Morocco question. In 1913, after the war between Serbia and Bulgaria, London and Paris were determined to prevent Serbia from becoming a great naval power, so the two powers offered Serbia a navy similar to that of Turkey, with the understanding that Turkey would guarantee that the new navy would not become a navy for the Triple Alliance. Berlin was opposed to the proposal both for reasons of geography and due to its view that the Ionian Islands and Greece were not really a Russian sphere of influence. However, in 1914, British and French naval and political officials in Paris and London secretly discussed the possibility of a naval alliance to counter the German threat. At this time, both nations were in fear of a rising Germany.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was in the process of abandoning its old naval traditions to become a modern state. To this end, it had purchased a few small ships, mostly British-built, and begun to build modern ships of its own. The British encouraged the Ottoman Empire to buy more modern British-sourced ships. With the outbreak of World War I, the Ottoman Navy did indeed increase its naval strength in order to maintain its strategic influence in the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea regions. Despite some minor improvements, Ottoman vessels remained obsolete. After the Armistice of Mudros, Greece demanded, against the wishes of Britain and of the Entente, the abolition of the naval agreements between Turkey and the Great Powers. The British then saw to it that their policy of economic support for Greece meant that in the short term the Ottoman Navy would decline. Also, at the end of the war, Turkey took over the Bosporus Dardanelles Straits, and the Greeks, fearing Turkish control over the straits, withdrew their navy from the area. In 1916 the Ottoman Navy, numbering only 8,000 soldiers, was considered an irreparable embarrassment. In spite of Greece\u2019s protests in the Balkan Peace Conference of the Hague (1917), the military treaty with Turkey was signed on July 2, 1917. In the peace treaty Turkey agreed to withdraw from the Dardanelles Straits. On July 2, 1918, the Ottoman Naval Headquarters was destroyed by the British and the French in Istanbul.\n\nClick anywhere inside the article to add text or insert superscripts, subscripts, and

{"id":996,"ended":true,"length":657,"text":"Hurricane Janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the season and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record. The hurricane formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 10. A second tropical wave was forecast to move off the west coast of Africa on September 13, and two other tropical wave were forecast to move off the coast of Africa by September 21.\n\nIn spite of an unfavorable environment for tropical cyclone formation due to a ridge of high pressure over the central Atlantic and a strong anticyclone over the eastern Atlantic, numerous tropical waves passed through the region and became extratropical due to interaction with the Saharan Dust plume. Forecasts from the GFS had been more pessimistic on the chances of forming a tropical cyclone during the time frame in question as compared to the European and NOGAPS models. The GFS was more aggressive in regard to the amount of thunderstorm activity associated with the system, though more than one run in many cases failed to produce cyclogenesis due in part to unfavorable environmental conditions. Once a tropical cyclone did form, the storm was very slow to strengthen. The storm took seven days to form, and had maximum sustained winds of 85 km\/h (50 mph) at its peak, despite being located near the surface and in an area where the air is very warm.\n\nOn September 12, tropical cyclone Janet formed near the eastern Lesser Antilles. Due to the lack of wind shear over the system and its proximity to land, the system developed into a powerful hurricane within five days. Later on September 12, the center of circulation was located at approximately 30\u00b0W, located well over a hundred miles east of Barbados.\n\nJanet was initially a large cyclone with a very intense rain band centered around its center. On September 13 Janet was slowly weakening, while producing heavy bands of rain across the northeastern Caribbean and across portions of the Greater Antilles. This was primarily due to interaction between the storm and the Saharan Dust plume, which was then situated to the southeast of the storm.\n\nDespite further weakening, Janet remained a large hurricane as it tracked west-northwestward across open areas of the tropical Atlantic. It continued to produce heavy rainfall across portions of Hispaniola and the northern Venezuela for the next three days. It accelerated northwestward to become a powerful extratropical cyclone on September 15, with winds of 120 km\/h (75 mph).\n\nAt the time it became an extratropical cyclone, Janet had very extensive rainfall totals in a relatively short time period, particularly in the eastern Amazon Basin. The central Amazon Basin saw one or two months of rainfall. In the Venezuelan states of Amazonas and Tachira, the 24-hour rainfall totals exceeded 20 cm. Flooding was widespread across the two states, and at least eight people were killed.\n\nClick anywhere inside the article to add text or insert superscripts, subscripts, and special characters.\nYou

{"id":4605,"ended":true,"length":648,"text":"I Corps was alerted to take part in the Syria @ - @ Lebanon Campaign although, Blamey having been promoted to Deputy Commander in Chief Middle East Command, it lacked a commanding officer in the area. The British 1st Armoured Division under the command of Lieutenant Colonel F.C.M.C. Lister was due to conduct a reconnaissance-inforce of the Lebanon \u2013 Syria frontier. But it did not see action.\n\nBy the time the I Corps came on the scene on the evening of March 6, there, in the early hours of March 7, was little left of the 4th Armoured Division of 3rd Armoured Brigade and only two Sherman tanks of 7th Tank Battalion (one being out of action). The 1st Corps and the 7th Independent Brigade on the line to the north of Bekaa were at full strength with Sherman tanks. As the day progressed the 2nd Armored Brigade which had joined the 4th Division under Lieutenant Colonel H.R.P.L. Gough had moved to Bint Jbeil, about 25 miles further east and there was no indication that it would go into action.\n\nThe 4th Armoured Division, which had joined the division at Baalbek on March 5, was in a very bad way indeed. The 2nd Tank Battalion, which was deployed in reserve in the Bekaa valley, would not receive its reinforcements until the morning of March 7. Even so, it was ordered out on a reconnaissance-inforce to Beirut. The 5th Tank Regiment, which covered the Beirut to Sidon road, was the only one in combat and the 4th Armoured Brigade had a total of 36 operational Sherman tanks.\n\nNo other tank regiment was available to replace these and, by the evening of March 7, the 4th Armoured Division had only three Shermans left in its field force. One of these broke down as the day wore on and another was badly damaged after it was hit. One Sherman of the 7th Tank Battalion had been severely damaged in action and it was only thanks to the presence of the 21st Independent Tank Battalion, which was on the reserve line in the Bekaa area, that three Shermans survived at the end of the day. Another Sherman of the 5th Tank Regiment was so seriously damaged that it would be out of action for weeks. On the eastern border it had been reinforced with an armored tractor at Qasr al-Ummar and the 6th Armored Engineer Support Squadron, and its engineer detachment, had been brought into reserve in the same area. The 2nd Tank Battalion and the 6th Armored Engineer Support Squadron were still in reserve and these units were able to take no part in the action. In the west the British forces were supported by an Israeli brigade.\n\nThe Syrian air force had meanwhile carried out a series of large-scale operations to strengthen air defenses along the border. A brigade of field artillery was ordered to the northern part of the Syrian-Lebanon border and a division of combat engineers was sent to the southern part. A force of infantry was also made available for the defense of the vital airfields at Tyre. In addition these forces formed the main force of the Syrian defensive line and were commanded by Brigadier General Gennadius.\n\nThe I Corps therefore took up defensive positions facing the area about 5 miles east of Beirut. It was clear that the situation would require some heavy fighting to gain advantage from it and once its tanks had been knocked out an offensive might well be impossible. At nightfall the 1st Armoured Division went into quarters about 5 miles north-east of

{"id":4202,"ended":true,"length":661,"text":"On March 10, 1955, WCLG filed an application to increase its power to 1 @, @ 000 watts, proposing to continue daytime @ - @ only broadcasts. The application was considered by WCLG's new Director of Engineering, Richard E. White -- \"White, the station engineer, had been on the job two weeks.\" An on-air announcement read:\n\n\"We are now at a point where WCLG can be heard on the AM dial from 8.00pm to 2.00am, and at these times this is a very important service to the community. But by filing an application to increase our power we can make our station stronger day and night. When the air waves are strong, so are our broadcasts. We are certain that the residents of the city will be glad to see us increase our power to 1,000 watts, at a cost of less than $100 a month.... And we are certainly sure that our efforts to bring you an all-night service -- with all of the latest news, music, and community information -- will be warmly welcomed by you and we ask you to give your support.\"\n\nOn or about February 3, 1955, WCLG applied for a $500 Federal license, stating that\n\n\"The frequency will be 930 kilocycles, wavelength 985 meters as measured from the top of the transmitter, with an antenna height of. The power limit is set at. The station is to have an effective radiated power of. The station will broadcast on a 50-watt signal of the same frequency and power as those to be received at the present station. When the station is not in use the transmitting antenna will be moved to a position which will provide the station with effective radiated power of. This will permit the station to be operated by a single employee, while covering the territory to be served by the station.\"\n\nAt the time of the application, WCLG stated that the new antenna was already installed and operating, but the station was then operating on a 20-watt signal. The new power was to be added at an estimated cost of $100 per month in the next few months.\n\nOn March 7, 1955, WCLG broadcast what would be its final station call sign WXA9 in an evening program announcement. The station was now to be licensed under the call sign WCLG. The March 10 application was filed by a successor to the current owner of the license, William L. Tull of Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe WCLG call letters were first applied to an AM station located in Dallas, Texas. That station had been licensed between January 1929 and September 1929. It shared the WCLG call letters with a short-lived AM station in Boston. When the calls were assigned to Boston, they were assigned to the station's shortwave transmissions at 960 kilocycles -- the same frequency that this station was now operating on.\n\nThe FCC granted the new owner's application on April 20, 1955, and WCLG took up its new calls in a change made effective immediately. However, the new owner failed to meet a deadline to have a new transmitter installed before filing for the license, and the FCC rejected the entire application as untimely.\n\nThe license would have originally allowed for nighttime operation on 1090 kilocycles, but the new owner requested that 1090 be modified so that nighttime operation on WCLG would cease once its nighttime broadcast operations ended. However, after the change was approved by the FCC, the new owner abandoned its plan and discontinued nighttime broadcasting on 1090 kilocycles.","token_len":741,"entropy":[7.4705,3.3047,0.2629,6.8355,0.1837,7.1732,9.0451,4.2518,5.4319,2.1999,1.3562,1.5059,6.4409,2.5363,4.2821,1.7411,8.3626,13.4316,6.095,6.5987,10.1905,6.5006,2.0239,10.095,1.0283,6.0303,12.3518,8.7787,5.4426,4.9024,9.504,11.0393,2.9625,1.5583,2.4232,0.823,5.5296,1.765,1.8391,0.1289,0.0015,2.6836,7.0618,4.1311,0.9377,3.1385,0.7897,4.54,4.3391,0.3139,5.4668,9.2039,3.9185,5.8706,3.2143,2.6525,8.9545,4.8243,1.6726,2.6505,1.8567,3.7997,0.9194,3.7898,5.9537,2.1865,2.5113,6.2313,6.0121,0.2617,1.5518,4.1876,4.2766,1.0093,2.1824,0.004,0.9925,2.6326,1.3729,2.8422,3.9627,2.7888,1.5069,0.7191,4.01,0.0786,0.0019,2.3818,3.1681,2.8818,2.1693,2.0496,6.3848,6.0197,4.1836,4.4139,2.8791,2.2122,3.6337,1.3451,3.4131,0.3814,0.4613,0.6529,1.8638,1.6893,3.1962,6.1223,0.4421,6.058,1.8077,2.6039,2.6015,1.8711,3.8797,2.1841,1.5186,2.4792,0.75,5.1287,5.5408,9.3283,1.6638,0.1388,1.4848,0.7052,1.3951,0.4399,2.5031,2.7714,3.2325,2.8615,2.3227,5.3474,9.1465,2.9715,0.086,1.3704,5.5597,2.0955,6.7735,6.524,1.8264,2.9415,1.3173,5.4783,1.2301,2.3262,2.9225,0.8058,1.9026,1.8084,6.7143,0.5905,2.1481,7.1771,0.5175,2.136,2.7247,0.8499,1.7708,3.835,0.3902,2.5029,1.4572,4.7125,0.4268,0.8104,2.1059,1.6352,2.6596,2.1824,0.2148,2.0073,4.3063,1.506,2.6404,0.5238,3.8479,0.007,0.5748,2.095,2.0799,0.9671,6.6593,4.9296,1.8685,1.5721,4.6279,4.8851,0.3736,2.4643,5.3825,2.1345,3.5283,4.5917,3.73,5.1511,0.1625,4.3442,2.8292,7.4737,3.8587,3.4116,2.3169,0.751,5.8905,2.9019,1.4222,3.7304,0.6399,1.1189,7.1846,3.0522,0.7364,0.1585,1.9692,10.8369,0.0435,0.5117,1.1744,3.7525,1.2594,4.7321,7.0504,1.4669,0.1981,4.363,3.9379,0.7513,2.1335,0.258,0.0006,2.8935,8.5438,0.3742,2.9951,3.7346,0.0306,0.798,0.0844,0.7288,0.0321,0.0019,4.9322,0.7504,1.1578,3.511,2.8675,8.6831,3.309,2.9599,4.6709,0.5528,5.9139,0.0003,0.2631,2.1291,6.2587,4.1876,0.4302,6.0695,3.9973,7.9263,5.4189,0.119,2.329,11.7767,3.5919,6.2496,3.7864,7.0688,2.8871,1.4205,1.2658,3.906,0.2106,0.4548,4.1767,2.3493,3.046,2.2351,3.0611,5.1237,0.2242,8.4689,5.3215,3.7223,6.3234,1.2396,3.7636,0.5053,3.6952,3.9918,2.0393,1.6513,4.3105,3.1612,2.4384,4.4118,8.0808,1.1793,0.9504,0.6357,1.9017,5.6016,1.5419,1.5976,4.3384,2.9861,2.302,4.6687,1.5156,2.7441,0.0407,4.8053,4.2808,3.8633,2.0795,1.3463,2.4899,3.5193,2.3349,5.2008,5.2964,0.6759,3.4072,2.4084,1.5785,5.5524,2.654,1.2814,5.2464,0.9523,1.1387,0.8707,3.0789,2.8071,1.9036,2.6386,6.0663,2.843,0.589,0.5501,4.7188,0.9214,1.4278,2.4048,3.5228,0.735,2.6079,1.9151,3.233,0.2265,5.3868,2.4916,0.0321,0.075,1.9761,0.8884,3.0664,1.5938,5.1019,0.852,0.7819,0.2179,2.5341,3.3948,3.4033,1.8047,2.8745,6.3904,1.886,3.9206,8.5955,1.0537,7.0153,4.7529,1.5183,4.7112,0.4161,1.4221,1.6706,1.6679,0.134,0.0002,4.5783,1.1401,0.7002,0.8172,0.9298,0.7791,0.4601,0.6091,0.0135,0.0007,4.5928,0.3421,1.9654,3.8274,4.332,1.2787,4.4041,1.6956,1.5141,3.2148,1.6496,1.6703,2.8482,2.3051,1.5469,5.7949,3.6166,2.4978,1.055,4.7365,0.4294,0.6043,0.0031,2.1174,1.0502,1.7434,2.973,3.6045,1.7951,2.9922,0.2658,3.8844,2.6673,2.7013,1.9372,0.5331,0.1017,0.2662,2.4185,1.4683,0.5489,4.4696,1.8605,3.7528,2.9171,1.8347,0.417,1.0364,0.0003,1.6202,1.7936,3.3389,0.0278,0.2005,0.0697,0.4004,0.0165,0.0012,6.5627,6.5963,2.3295,1.7868,1.5798,2.5386,3.8403,2.0632,10.5866,6.2502,5.462,4.896,5.5759,4.3046,4.5401,4.4115,3.0833,9.0375,0.9878,1.3814,0.9391,1.5193,4.8906,4.6759,1.2591,7.0547,3.6927,0.5418,10.4204,0.2522,1.3035,3.0271,0.1718,2.473,1.7035,8.5413,3.1504,4.2896,1.6452,2.6072,1.7135,3.6209,9.3927,2.9245,1.1166,5.683,7.2168,1.4351,0.614,4.7247,1.0757,4.2827,3.3061,0.0704,5.4621,4.2537,4.4872,4.8902,0.8431,1.0343,0.4481,1.0783,0.0002,2.2158,2.0656,1.3644,0.003,3.49,9.5399,1.4442,4.8222,5.5364,0.8479,4.7212,5.8513,1.5357,5.3265,0.8039,5.9633,0.337,0.2725,1.0355,5.4257,0.424,2.4184,0.9339,3.5804,6.7698,2.8723,6.5856,0.0594,2.9483,2.5651,1.0733,3.3045,8.8618,1.0496,3.0095,1.1299,0.0051,1.5337,2.4696,0.7648,2.49,6.349,1.3746,0.7985,3.9036,0.1993,0.9878,5.1296,1.8917,5.2527,0.9038,5.6513,0.7294,5.9449,0.6318,5.9232,0.6309,2.1264,0.3782,3.3865,0.3491,1.8152,1.7931,2.6205,5.6787,3.6051,6.3508,3.3226,10.3454,3.3423,1.1022,0.0109,5.5137,2.361,1.3097,1.7747,2.3544,7.1355,0.8077,1.1642,4.9163,1.6673,0.9733,0.3957,0.9009,0.0002,1.7745,5.7094,4.0141,1.7216,4.6391,4.387,3.2044,0.9774,1.1539,2.0255,3.4879,0.1083,0.7148,0.8527,1.6601,2.5496,0.0769,0.0006,5.5385,3.5314,2.647,3.006,6.3274,2.4908,2.7437,7.3987,5.0469,6.3696,3.016,1.2718,4.8682,0.0271,1.4805,2.4025,1.272,4.5626,0.0636,3.4806,3.9507,3.5564,1.6161,5.4645,3.1263,1.3508,4.4805,1.0697,5.0265,7.3404,1.8397,1.4971,1.4366,2.5451,1.0621,1.4474,2.5699,4.424,0.4638,7.3737,0.555,4.1275,6.2632,1.0949,0.0,0.3272,0.7881,0.0002,1.9237,4.0465,5.386,2.0504,7.2604,4.8206,3.3745,8.1669,5.0733,2.1547,5.5047,6.7464,1.4978,0.0838,0.0043,1.2059,0.722,1.4685,2.6841,1.02,5.3903,0.9672,5.0628,0.1835,1.6904,6.2667,2.5001,0.279,4.1353,1.4808,2.0821,3.3639,1.4405,0.001,1.7091,4.8962,4.8655,4.5802,4.3059,3.1184,5.7376,4.1567,0.2592,3.9861,0.0127,3.9177,1.5871,3.3648,1.5554,

{"id":2093,"ended":true,"length":648,"text":"The novel revolves around the fictionalized figure of Bol\u00edvar and includes many minor characters who are part of the General's travelling party, whom he meets on his journey or who come to him in times of need. As one character says: \"Bol\u00edvar is an historical, not a mythological, figure, and a fact that can be known, confirmed, and verified is an infinite resource. But mythological beings can be created with the aid of words, with the help of the human imagination.\"\n\nContents\n\nThe novel begins at Fort San Jos\u00e9 in Santo Domingo on September 4, 1764, when General Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn gives two orders to his subordinates: the first is to form an expedition to follow General Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. Once General Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar leaves he sends his own personal bodyguard, Manuel Rodr\u00edguez, with a letter offering a reward of $20,000 to anyone who succeeds in obtaining information on the whereabouts of Bol\u00edvar's remaining family.[1] The second order requires all military units in the army to be put on high alert should Bol\u00edvar attempt to flee.[2][3]\n\nThe first part of the novel takes place in and around Bogot\u00e1, as Bol\u00edvar and his army advance from the Andes, encountering numerous obstacles in their way. Most of his main characters\u2014those who figure prominently in the overall plot\u2014are soldiers. Manuel Rodr\u00edguez tells of the hardships he and Bol\u00edvar suffered when on their way to Santa Marta. Other characters, such as Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, also contribute information on the whereabouts of Bol\u00edvar. General Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar makes a brief appearance at the end of the novel and delivers a speech.\n\nThe author states in the foreword to the novel that many writers had attempted to write the life of Bol\u00edvar. He believed that others had written \"an exaggerated version, but mine is quite the opposite of that.\"[1] He wanted to write a historical novel, avoiding the romantic aspects of other novels that had already been written. He describes his research on Bol\u00edvar in the preface which begins as follows:\n\nA little over a year ago, after having read and enjoyed some extraordinary books which are so full of details and historical and geographical information, I decided to try writing a novel about Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, which at that time I told a friend of mine that I was going to do. That was on May 1, 1866,[4] just in a few minutes before my first novel, \"Marriage Contract\", was published. With Bol\u00edvar I decided to write a historical novel, which is my specialty, and not a novel of romance, which some people have written about Bol\u00edvar; it was with this idea that I began writing the book, and nothing else.[5]\n\nThe first edition of the novel featured the foreword written by Rufino Tamayo (1820\u20131897), a writer best known for his epic novel \"The Tragic Death of the Archbishop of Mexico,\" which was the basis of many movie, theater, and television productions. Tamayo became the first author to translate The Three Musketeers into Spanish and he is best known for his novel The Tragic Death of the Archbishop, based on his own experience of the death of Archbishop of Mexico and a major historical figure in Mexico and other Latin American countries.

{"id":2091,"ended":true,"length":673,"text":"As he reflects on the past, the General often thinks and dreams about his former friend Francisco de Paula Santander. The historical Francisco de Paula Santander was a friend of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, considered one of the best soldiers of the American War of Independence. He was born in 1758, and died in 1838. However, due to an accident in 1833, the General is only fifty years old now, and he can be found in the present day in the village El C\u00edrculo, in the province of Caracas, in Venezuela, with Jos\u00e9 Mancilla and Miguel V\u00e1squez and the new friends.\n\nAfter leaving Tumbes, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and the General travelled together through several countries, including Venezuela, where they managed to get a lot of money. With all those millions of dollars, the two friends purchased a huge ranch named \" El C\u00edrculo \". However much the General's wealth increased, so did his craving for the land, and that is why in 1776 both men were looking for a piece of land in Venezuela that would be fit to build a house. The General ended up arriving at a ranch named El C\u00edrculo and to build a mansion. At first he wanted to build it without the support of the town where it is located, but that was impossible, as the inhabitants of El C\u00edrculo were not going to leave their home so the General can build a huge fortress. But the General was brave, and after a few weeks of negotiation, he got the townspeople to agree to give him their land to build the fortress. On that land, the General had a large mansion, where he used to spend most of his time, and the mansion is still there, still in a good shape.\n\nThere had been a long journey between Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and Francisco de Paula Santander, as well as the General's departure from Tumbes, and it was around that area that all of this happened. And it was in 1775, after having won a battle in which the General lost his best soldiers, and he still hadn't been successful in winning the war against the Spanish, that he decided to start a journey where he wanted to fight for the freedom of all Venezuela. The journey started in November 1775, and took place in the northern part of Venezuela ( on the shores of Guiana ), where at that time, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and the soldiers made a short stop at the small town of Roraima. With the news of the trip spreading further, the news reached Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's former friend Francisco de Paula Santander, who knew that the General didn't plan to stay in Venezuela for a long time.\n\nAfter his stay in Venezuela, he went back to his village in the state of Aragua, in Venezuela, which was called \"San Juan del R\u00edo \". He had an agreement with the landowners, and he ended up staying there for his rest of his life. As for the General, there are some theories about where the General went during his entire stay in Venezuela. According to some sources. the General wanted to build a military base in the area, and the soldiers could stay there during their journey. On the other hand, others say the General was building a mansion on his land. After the war was over, the General sold his land to a French military officer, and left Venezuela from Caracas once more. Other sources say the General returned to the town El C\u00edrculo to meet his old friend, but those same sources don't say what happened there.","token_len":741,"entropy":[5.0485,8.6174,0.2984,1.2006,3.0335,1.3652,2.6488,9.7274,7.7126,5.2436,6.2971,4.4867,1.2286,2.2364,5.1111,4.6214,10.617,3.9562,6.8093,6.9313,4.5219,1.3484,2.9842,8.6802,9.3854,2.075,0.07,0.2487,0.0032,1.7283,1.2082,4.6713,0.4971,10.0055,0.706,0.8773,0.739,0.0006,1.3859,7.4199,2.0615,0.023,0.3471,3.211,5.6339,0.9285,0.6259,5.1743,4.345,0.7529,0.1139,0.5146,2.0524,0.9984,2.625,0.6004,3.4144,4.5916,1.8568,1.4847,2.7761,0.3577,1.2616,4.4649,0.4421,5.4477,0.0771,6.0673,0.0048,3.779,1.8394,1.8053,2.0881,3.8392,0.256,2.2678,1.3379,4.4194,5.4288,4.684,1.1443,0.1092,4.5045,1.3991,0.6027,2.1643,4.4049,2.5713,2.2735,1.5369,1.7618,5.0157,1.0611,2.5654,1.5496,4.6332,8.0078,3.5939,5.5883,2.9748,2.4423,0.7404,1.5053,2.156,0.888,5.2212,0.0373,4.7675,0.9429,1.3757,2.9096,2.2673,1.9438,2.9618,5.9822,5.3288,4.4839,5.2582,3.2292,5.3494,5.3011,2.6658,0.0034,4.6915,3.2489,6.3287,5.0771,3.2119,1.023,0.0258,4.0125,3.6438,6.7994,6.2222,7.2588,1.3833,4.1297,0.0015,0.4342,0.0021,0.0019,3.0063,2.0592,1.7743,5.641,3.691,4.3781,4.6456,2.0194,1.0412,2.0354,3.6691,0.5328,4.3707,0.7648,5.8081,0.0653,2.8171,2.1731,5.8431,0.0421,3.0877,1.7736,5.0156,4.2416,4.861,6.432,1.3243,0.2467,0.9831,1.7101,5.9992,4.2667,7.3279,0.7235,5.2632,3.8962,6.0195,3.3818,8.8109,1.6162,0.9843,0.0177,0.006,0.0103,4.0155,4.5613,9.5308,2.0845,1.8066,3.1512,4.0397,5.4976,0.783,3.4272,3.7516,0.7157,8.4194,0.2516,3.2225,1.7277,1.6843,0.89,4.7293,2.1763,1.3621,4.5455,3.0718,3.4948,8.631,2.3036,2.4986,6.2637,0.2486,0.9395,5.7264,0.0148,0.3447,1.6469,2.1119,3.7673,1.2681,1.8532,7.5567,2.3438,3.2449,0.5605,2.9419,1.3565,2.0299,1.2942,6.6752,0.0232,7.4298,1.6139,2.5412,2.8005,2.3807,2.7839,0.633,0.151,0.0057,0.0073,0.0137,2.9604,6.221,3.1776,1.1252,3.9116,2.2944,4.3934,1.4064,2.175,2.9175,0.4931,1.1262,2.5449,5.0179,1.607,4.7029,0.0806,0.7011,5.8789,5.3848,3.171,2.7096,1.0736,0.5584,0.3002,3.6137,1.1796,4.2773,2.3806,1.9546,1.1357,5.0138,1.0219,2.0979,0.0595,0.0028,0.0012,0.004,0.0031,1.2779,2.373,6.0466,0.0971,4.1628,1.8205,3.0436,4.9474,3.8576,0.8706,8.1085,2.3188,1.2171,5.7355,7.259,1.6042,4.0753,2.179,0.9716,2.3792,8.0167,2.8271,0.349,3.4981,1.9858,1.8873,2.8253,1.5429,4.6953,0.9847,1.0284,4.1653,1.122,4.1256,6.2933,0.0001,0.2514,0.8621,0.388,3.068,1.0196,3.4196,0.7113,4.5222,0.1764,1.9872,2.9236,0.3473,4.9817,3.8614,4.4227,0.7361,1.013,0.3195,3.4095,2.0263,3.0767,3.3778,1.2886,3.7136,0.4953,4.0369,0.7979,3.3599,3.0989,0.0208,0.0351,0.328,1.6762,1.218,2.7963,3.4231,2.4181,1.8078,1.2184,2.4766,3.4278,2.7822,3.3653,3.3965,2.7535,0.605,0.8233,0.0002,5.1362,6.7269,0.2851,1.6036,4.0891,4.5125,3.4458,6.5492,0.0032,0.0496,0.0003,0.0017,0.1751,1.7859,0.1883,0.0026,0.0064,0.0012,0.6302,3.0291,2.76,0.012,2.0837,3.521,0.5294,5.0845,0.6445,1.2819,0.0015,0.0049,0.9906,1.7818,2.6103,1.2228,5.4945,2.6148,9.4823,0.7695,6.2348,1.8277,3.0,1.227,0.2397,5.3547,2.6048,1.1712,3.1184,3.9305,2.752,1.6147,3.7625,4.1959,5.5598,2.1401,2.8996,2.0341,3.1203,1.2636,0.3411,1.9644,1.5494,6.5231,4.88,0.4465,3.9941,3.3706,5.4564,5.5577,0.0016,2.2965,5.2042,1.3061,2.8573,1.2707,1.1389,2.2299,0.709,1.883,1.478,0.1957,1.96,1.4689,0.1239,4.1206,1.4587,5.8809,6.2007,0.3583,4.5335,0.0748,6.4074,2.7635,1.2281,4.1827,0.2058,2.5269,4.5253,0.4186,2.3759,2.0735,2.2848,1.4431,6.56,0.4392,0.6105,0.5085,1.4556,5.0732,4.6691,0.8711,1.1589,5.234,0.639,0.0022,2.1116,4.7424,11.0644,0.6078,6.0734,0.0104,5.6648,4.8784,3.107,1.3966,4.9763,1.7853,0.1356,1.8838,2.7621,0.0027,0.0269,0.0003,0.0027,1.6107,1.3534,7.4321,5.6498,1.4819,3.3182,2.4139,1.4893,0.9686,5.1469,0.7623,0.1834,5.0971,6.1227,3.5423,0.2122,1.4778,4.9443,1.0656,5.4391,1.0463,0.7752,6.592,2.9237,6.0048,0.5958,0.7778,8.2537,2.9415,2.8931,0.0072,0.029,0.0004,0.0047,2.1769,7.4518,1.414,1.8337,0.3463,0.0051,0.0076,0.0012,0.5889,0.4958,4.4855,1.4912,1.4307,0.302,5.658,0.0008,5.7794,0.6334,2.0271,1.4135,1.5851,1.3237,2.6358,0.3799,0.0871,0.8844,2.4599,0.0003,3.0662,3.9162,3.8272,0.4256,2.0419,0.1443,3.3612,2.9248,2.0336,0.1358,1.9625,4.4694,1.8689,1.675,4.4779,0.0349,4.5629,1.6821,0.3961,0.864,2.5389,2.4303,0.5133,4.3714,1.3048,3.6062,2.1596,5.3562,1.9532,3.2339,4.8061,0.7191,0.1476,3.6045,1.9924,2.6527,4.7411,5.3456,0.2657,1.0005,8.2134,1.9108,1.5214,2.3657,6.9931,0.0448,2.119,0.8515,0.7928,5.8627,3.7314,2.9642,0.3902,0.0787,0.5469,3.9971,2.7336,1.0639,2.5149,0.5792,4.1681,1.9736,2.6713,5.9183,1.7118,3.2545,2.393,0.69,1.8467,4.6272,0.6168,6.5087,1.4206,1.1639,0.8259,0.9008,3.8101,0.001,2.3844,3.0553,7.8598,5.9251,0.417,5.4827,0.0984,4.5823,0.336,4.6612,0.8788,1.1974,1.1984,2.9826,0.989,1.463,2.685,3.3772,4.8205,3.8321,0.4136,4.604,2.4506,4.5787,0.8549,4.8604,0.4818,0.3912,0.0316,0.0675,3.3332,1.2423,2.873,0.2181,1.9117,7.1151,0.3792,4.1261,2.6723,2.5902,1.9745,1.6706,5.0905,1.9049,3.7144,4.2261,0.1494,0.1231,0.9747,0.4893,6.3826,0.874,0.6843,0.7737,2.1843,4.9593,5.126,2.6916,1.4528,1.2726,4.4333,2.3353,6.7421,4.6936,0.0014,7.6892,0.8099,0.4211,7.3878,1.1434,0.8538,1.6725,0.1688,4.6982,0.267,1.7896,4.2069,7.8259,0.6573,0.012,0.002,0.0

{"id":1844,"ended":true,"length":688,"text":"The influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream create a mild oceanic climate. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging 6 @. @ 5 \u00b0 C ( 43 @. @ 7 \u00b0 F). With mild, relatively low humidity. Spring and autumn are mild and dry, summer hot and humid. It is possible for a winter day to be in the 70s F (. @ 31 \u00b0 C) and have a humidity of 5 percent @. @ 30 %. Summers are often very hot and humid, sometimes with temperatures in the 90s F (35 @. @ 37 \u00b0 C).\n\nWinter and early spring are generally pleasant and moderate except for a few days of blustery cold and light snow (often light and fleeting). During these periods, average minimum and maximum temperatures are often below normal. Summers are characterized by cool, humid conditions with frequent thunderstorms, with daily temperatures rarely exceeding 78 F (25. @ 25. \u00b0 C) in July and August and often in the upper 70s F (21. @ 22. \u00b0 C) in July and August.\n\nThe annual precipitation totals are very different by region with the wettest part of the winter and spring season typically along the east coast, in the western and central areas, and in the mountains. Winter snows are light and short-lived, but do affect roads as well as crops and pastures. Winter rains are more frequent and extensive in the humid, eastern part of the state north of I-65. Spring temperatures are generally cool with frequent rains, often severe, but also warm enough to allow most plant growth. The heaviest rain often occurs in May and June, during which thunderstorms are frequent.\n\nThe state has eight regional climates. Each region has a distinct climate and distinct temperatures and precipitation levels. They also influence local plant and animal life in many subtle ways.\n\nThe climate of the state is dominated by the Gulf Stream which brings moderate temperatures to the southern areas, but also cool, humid northerly winds which bring the cooler temperatures to the southern part of the State along the coastline and in the southern mountains. This is an important reason why the climate along the south coast of the state is generally milder than in the northern part of the State. The westerly winds also aid in preventing the cold temperatures in northern parts of the sate from moving south. On the eastern border of the state, with the east-to-west alignment of the Appalachians, a southerly wind flow brings the cool and humid atmosphere and a much warmer, dryer climate to the eastern part of the state.\n\nTemperatures in central Kentucky are typically cooler than areas to the south. In the southern mountains the temperatures in May and June average 10 degrees cooler than the lower elevations. Much of central Kentucky is in a \"pine flat\" region, with the cool, dry climates found at higher elevations. The average yearly rainfall is about 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThe average yearly temperature ranges from about 52 degrees F (11. @ 7\u00b0C) in the coastal mountains to 54 degrees F (11. @ 14. @ 6\u00b0C) in the central plain (at approximately 600 feet [180 meters] or so above sea level). The average yearly rainfall ranges from around 45 inches (115 centimeters) south of I-65 in the coastal mountains to around 37 inches (930 millimeters) in the central plain, and some coastal areas to the north have very little rain.

{"id":3067,"ended":true,"length":709,"text":"The game begins as the player's group of mercenaries arrives by ship to defend Targos. They report to the town palisade and fend off an assault by the goblin army. Afterwards, the party makes its way to meet the local commander, who has tasked the group to find the missing mayor of Targos, who is a goblin. This section contains spoilers related to the game's first dungeon \"A New Tomorrow\".\n\nAfter speaking with the commander, the party goes inside a nearby cave to rest for the night. Early in the morning, the party is awakened by a loud noise outside, but nothing is seen. They later venture outside to try and find out how things are. Inside the cave, however, they discover several goblin corpses that have had their heads blown off.\n\nThe party explores the cave to see what they can find. The cave goes on for a considerable distance, with many chambers and a few small caves. The party encounters more goblins and is forced to retreat. After the party is safely back in the ship, a large explosion is heard in the distance. They investigate the area and destroy the wreckage. They investigate the debris and find several keys lying around.\n\nThe party heads further to the north to where the debris appears to have come from. There they find a town where everything is in ruins, but the town's former mayor is still alive. They make their way into town. Suddenly, a loud sound is heard. The party investigates and locates the source. A swarm of goblins attacks the town. They defend the town but also find several townsfolk in the surrounding area who are dead.\n\nThe party takes the former mayor into a nearby building and barricades the entrances. The party makes a plan to escape the goblins and escape the town in a ship. They discover that the only safe way to leave this town is through the entrance to a ship graveyard. They explore it. After the party makes its way through the graveyard, they learn that another ship was already waiting for them. Back on the ship it now appears to be night again.\n\nAfter the party arrives at the graveyard, an explosion is heard. The party heads in the direction of the explosion as they hear a voice say they're welcome. A fight occurs, and the party escapes. However, while the party was fighting the goblins, the mayor of the town was killed.\n\nAt least 1 party member is turned to stone and the rest see a vision of the current king of the goblins. [1]\n\nDuring this section of the game, it is learned that the goblins will eventually destroy everything they cannot control. They intend to have a \"monstrous race\" and create a new world, which they plan to name after themselves.\n\nThe player also learns that they will never be able to escape it. \"The only way off this island is by a sea passage to the other side of the world. A passage that this island will be consumed in. Our time will be spent trying to hold it back. \"\n\nIf all 4 parties members survive the boss fight with the townspeople, the following conversation will ensue.\n\nKing (or someone who represents him) : \"I did not imagine you would be this strong...

{"id":679,"ended":true,"length":658,"text":"ESA's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer ( JUICE ) has been selected as part of ESA's Cosmic Vision science program. It is expected to launch in 2022 and, after a series of three-month, four-orbit missions, will begin a detailed examination into the planet's composition, shape, composition, and history while searching for clues about how Earth formed. As the largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter \u2013 including its mysterious Icy Moons, the most distant objects we know of in the solar system beyond Neptune \u2013 holds secrets about the emergence of planets elsewhere.\n\nJUICE is a joint and coordinated project led by the European Space Agency (ESA) in Germany. JUICE will be Europe's first mission to explore the four Icy Moons in orbit around Jupiter: Ganymede, Europa, Callisto, and Io.\n\nThe Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer mission will be the first to search for the \"missing link\" between Earth and planets beyond Neptune, using the powerful capabilities available in the new generation of launch vehicles currently being developed in Europe.\n\nJUICE will address fundamental questions about the existence and potential habitability of planets or life in our solar system, as well as the evolution of planets and satellites beyond the Earth.\n\nESA Administrator Jan Woerner said \"This is a fantastic result. I'm really pleased to announce today our selection of Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer to be part of the Cosmic Vision science programme. I know that the European Space Agency members and our entire team are ready to take this ambitious project forward and continue to make ESA's contribution to the discovery of the outer solar system and our place in the universe a reality. We've invested more than \u20ac 500 million in the mission already, and I call on the European Union member states to fund the project in full as part of their national programmes.\"\n\nJUICE's principal investigators are based across European partner countries (the ESA member states plus Switzerland, Norway and the U.K.). The mission has support for the development of major elements from ESA member states, along with contributions from the European Commission, industry and the Member States of the Benelux nations in the form of the Joint Undertaking (JU), an agency of the EU to coordinate research through the European space program.\n\nESA is already supporting development of JUICE, which was declared an ESA project on 18 April. The mission is part of the Cosmic Vision program established in 2014, which is the long-term framework to shape the future direction of ESA's scientific missions, missions for Earth observation and for space technology, as well as missions in human space exploration.\n\nThe mission will be launched between late 2022 and the end of the decade. On reaching Jupiter, JUICE will begin a three-month, four-orbit exploration of three \"major\" Jovian moons: Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. From those encounters, and through the data it collects, the mission will study Jovian moons, explore their surface conditions, perform chemical analyses, and build maps of temperature and gravity fields.\n\nFrom that exploration, scientists will assess whether there is any habitability in the Icy Moons and find possible resources to sustain future life and life-like environments.\n\nAs well as studying the Icy Moons and Jupiter itself, JUICE is expected to explore the possibility of a habitable exo-solar system, and to explore the impact of Jupiter's atmosphere and magnetosphere on Jupiter's moons.\n\nJUICE will operate in full \"autonomy\" to operate on all its missions, including its entry, descent and landing.","token_len":742,"entropy":[4.4482,11.3407,7.2711,7.4284,2.9536,6.5872,1.8914,6.3015,4.7106,0.4696,0.5919,2.8419,1.9351,5.1302,1.2692,3.5761,0.0019,4.9997,0.0191,6.9742,5.325,7.4218,2.1005,0.7717,3.1435,2.1492,2.6013,0.0761,2.7239,0.8352,4.5985,1.4876,5.066,3.7961,1.958,3.0855,0.0009,4.2847,2.9291,1.6332,4.2582,3.1278,0.0253,4.0365,1.4916,0.5309,0.8018,3.7267,3.5426,5.3608,4.0412,4.5647,0.5495,3.1911,0.2601,4.0252,1.4007,4.9446,0.8089,3.1336,0.6798,0.7797,4.0702,6.8194,5.5114,0.0448,2.7861,1.8972,2.5738,4.6125,1.4739,0.7508,6.0392,2.4397,6.8576,2.4881,0.7902,1.2798,0.3306,0.0011,0.2638,0.9591,8.1151,7.2691,0.5979,6.9427,7.9971,0.0123,2.7708,2.1926,2.7125,4.4803,2.8415,3.7811,4.7293,1.7283,0.2596,4.532,0.9127,0.5683,0.0045,8.2848,1.609,0.4592,4.9719,7.0819,0.9904,1.28,7.7239,0.2505,5.1545,6.1767,2.1259,0.8158,0.0006,1.8408,2.3067,0.0004,1.3367,1.8235,3.2966,7.7897,5.9281,1.3648,4.9846,0.0058,1.4063,1.0292,0.1642,0.0007,0.9022,0.0765,0.563,3.9556,4.982,2.6275,2.2915,0.0308,0.0006,1.9731,2.3043,7.4322,0.0038,1.0547,2.1145,0.2737,1.9582,1.012,6.4127,5.1788,0.0099,0.0621,2.24,2.3119,0.3072,0.6792,6.5902,5.5891,0.6782,0.0003,0.0002,0.3514,2.5429,0.1119,2.203,0.0026,0.0001,0.5181,0.3224,2.6034,0.181,1.8791,0.0003,2.026,4.1278,0.6445,0.0019,1.1699,0.1843,3.2516,1.6187,2.3858,1.7268,0.6789,2.4369,5.6191,0.2197,2.6454,5.2642,1.9082,1.6957,0.122,0.4145,2.0943,0.2517,5.4406,2.5761,0.8964,1.4826,4.0429,1.8481,5.3488,8.3325,6.742,2.3312,1.0714,4.1295,5.7518,0.2589,7.963,0.3186,6.6881,2.4787,0.7041,2.6523,1.7936,0.5092,1.1665,0.0002,1.4569,0.4183,0.0007,1.0362,6.9874,4.6743,0.497,0.4109,0.7325,5.7471,2.1616,4.9986,6.9096,0.0053,0.0304,2.8454,6.3223,4.4014,2.0844,1.0855,0.2246,0.0015,1.2569,2.4239,0.0441,0.0039,1.3521,4.359,0.2147,3.3032,1.5576,7.142,3.4606,2.4699,3.8397,1.7871,1.2553,0.0002,4.6366,6.6546,4.255,3.6534,1.6799,0.0352,1.1374,3.8801,3.1426,1.2422,0.9527,4.361,5.3857,1.9656,3.5021,1.7366,3.2749,1.2888,1.5273,3.411,4.0604,3.4452,2.5099,0.5534,3.85,1.1675,0.0011,0.2107,5.0045,2.3281,2.6901,0.8715,0.0005,1.1016,1.8255,0.0174,1.0475,3.6322,0.9946,3.2825,3.1712,1.2037,2.4681,3.6689,0.2786,0.0009,8.2791,2.7139,2.8624,6.9579,2.2863,1.4667,4.9575,0.3336,2.5759,1.1253,4.4216,1.9317,2.2353,1.7131,4.077,0.7072,3.4683,6.6316,0.6407,2.7811,0.1353,0.9318,4.2009,0.2626,2.3475,5.5619,1.7142,0.0068,3.4818,3.0829,4.9586,0.3283,0.2821,1.5624,2.9051,0.7418,1.0335,2.0517,3.3463,5.2545,3.9041,0.0985,1.8944,10.1678,0.1341,1.1628,1.5369,2.9749,4.4093,1.4802,0.637,2.3273,8.5154,0.3596,2.147,0.8254,4.2422,6.1658,0.1081,0.4055,5.3264,1.6544,2.985,2.3141,2.4218,3.5464,2.6096,0.0006,1.8964,4.0724,3.1062,1.5025,0.0714,0.0002,1.2255,0.2986,0.0005,2.0421,4.6874,5.8235,1.3671,5.3807,6.4738,5.2602,8.2004,1.1076,5.0023,3.2009,5.7625,5.8167,0.4012,3.6731,3.5769,0.6822,3.465,2.5929,2.0612,3.1146,0.0202,0.2314,2.0888,1.5798,1.5284,3.8903,8.4835,3.5731,2.4311,3.2162,0.154,7.5489,6.7046,3.8714,5.0234,7.3345,0.7155,1.328,5.1595,0.0106,5.6103,0.2098,1.5583,1.2793,3.768,0.7528,6.4033,1.281,1.9831,8.1939,0.1076,0.9488,0.4758,12.4377,0.044,0.0,6.4978,3.3466,1.4451,3.8872,0.0005,2.482,5.7674,8.3158,1.2096,2.9247,0.1455,1.4834,8.6551,4.0045,5.7181,1.3564,0.4481,3.2939,3.5104,2.6693,4.0507,6.2879,1.5649,1.4578,3.759,3.6897,0.3922,0.5035,0.0002,3.2441,2.1373,5.03,5.4667,5.6519,0.304,3.4437,0.0032,0.0012,3.1035,1.8552,3.6129,7.789,3.3536,1.7591,3.6377,2.5397,3.9688,2.7216,2.3889,1.5589,2.1945,1.5306,3.3777,0.0026,1.206,4.0916,0.04,2.6855,4.5025,1.0777,3.0529,1.9741,1.099,2.4907,3.4869,6.977,0.1355,0.2234,7.0105,2.8691,7.4022,0.734,1.498,4.1108,0.1241,2.1882,0.248,2.7777,2.9088,2.8922,6.1647,4.0787,3.937,1.1155,0.9,4.124,4.0645,4.7586,2.5666,2.2317,0.0392,0.0034,4.7789,3.0433,5.9762,0.637,1.7915,0.4978,0.5821,0.0002,2.0323,1.7165,1.5852,1.8983,1.7172,3.9372,6.418,3.0425,0.0746,2.9861,0.8307,0.0013,1.6703,2.1083,0.9746,5.3885,8.7191,1.4027,0.3926,1.1989,0.0022,0.0005,0.1218,3.378,1.3652,2.8233,0.0353,0.6288,1.1978,0.3561,0.0035,0.001,4.9285,1.4162,6.0952,5.9828,5.5278,0.8067,5.7372,1.5856,0.0338,0.3999,2.5229,1.8903,0.2718,2.4196,0.0003,0.0002,0.0008,1.0807,0.4706,0.0028,0.0044,0.3543,5.3354,5.134,8.9641,0.2197,5.4618,3.3197,1.5255,8.0521,3.6708,1.5712,0.7181,1.6385,1.3416,0.1952,3.2547,6.2833,0.2464,0.0245,1.5124,2.3063,5.9801,1.8416,4.2517,3.6827,0.5491,6.7456,5.142,0.8937,1.0953,0.5613,5.167,6.0054,0.6089,10.795,1.0554,2.3645,5.2412,0.9082,0.5887,0.0002,5.3792,3.2572,4.0823,0.2677,4.7719,0.3994,5.5013,3.8366,2.9807,0.6843,2.168,5.2426,0.0923,2.1471,0.8632,3.079,0.0031,0.1618,2.0761,5.226,3.7135,6.5706,1.2773,4.5362,5.0173,2.4725,3.5505,3.2266,2.0575,2.843,2.4475,0.9932,1.2418,0.0002,4.6327,2.6622,0.1049,3.1469,1.2734,2.3469,0.0008,0.0388,2.4109,3.1129,5.4619,0.0595,0.7005,0.0036,0.0005,2.3911,3.5088,0.0013,2.789,1.0291,5.7322,0.1067,3.0987,3.1005,4.39,3.5353,0.614,3.5088,0.0531,0.3455,1.5183,3.2176,2.13,1.9807,1.0944,4.4633,0.2187,3.4427,0.363,2.7019,1.5914,6.3289,0.047,0.2854,4.1323,0.1197,3.759,0.498,0.6559,0.0002,0.8699,0.3852,0.0005,1.0218,5.3763

{"id":3570,"ended":true,"length":565,"text":"The Ersatz Yorck @ - @ class ships were protected with Krupp cemented steel armor, as was the standard for German warships of the period. The armor layout was identical to the preceding Kaiser-class vessels, with Krupp armor plates bolted to a steel plated \" armor belt \" atop watertight decks, connected by a steel deck above that. The Krupp belt was divided into eight \" horizontal \" plates ( 1- 5, 2-4, 3-7 ). The 8.6-Inch Krupp plate, which, in addition, was strengthened by a 1-1\/2- and 2- Inch layer of wrought iron armor, was bolted to the Krupp plating by way of special bolted \" tie plates \". The main belt was protected by a 1-1\/2- to 2- Inch layer of wrought iron armor, with a 2-1\/2 Inch Krupp plate bolted to it. The armor configuration varied slightly in the casemate, with two additional Krupp plating layers over a 1-Inch layer of wrought iron armor. For all of the Ersatz Yorck @ class, the steel belt was protected by wrought iron armor, which, to compensate for the increased weight and size, increased in thickness.\n\nThe casemate armor configuration varied slightly, with a total of five Krupp plating layers ( 1 2 2-3 ) over the previous 3 layers, although the Ersatz Yorck @ class's casemate protection was essentially identical to that of the last Kaiser-class vessels. Thus, for most of the Ersatz Yorck at ~, both casemate armor configurations had a total Krupp plating overlay of 6-7 Inch ; by the end of the war, this had increased to 7-8 Inch ( 8-9 Inch in later ships ). The casemate's 2-1\/2-Inch Krupp overlay was strengthened by a 1-1\/2-Inch of wrought steel armor for the Ersatz Yorck @-class vessels.\n\nFor the Ersatz Yorck at +, four additional Krupp overlay plates ( 1- 3-3 ) were bolted to the 7-8 Inch Krupp plate, while the armor for the 1 2 and 2 3 layers remained unchanged. For the last two vessels, an additional 1-1\/2-Inch piece of armor at the level of the deck increased the casemate total to 8 Inch. All of the casemate armor was bolted to a steel deck in a similar manner to the armor belts and plating.\n\nThe Krupp plating for the casemate was overlapped by 1-3 Inch wrought iron armor, while the 1-2 Inch wrought iron was overlapped by a 1-Inch armor plate bolted directly to the top deck ( Fig. 1 ). Two additional pieces of 1-1\/2-Inch steel were bolted directly to the top deck and over the bridge, and a 2-Inch armor plate was bolted to the armored deck over the bridge.\n\nFor the Ersatz Yorck at -, the casemate was protected by a Krupp overlay, 1-3 Inch and two-thirds of a 1-Inch steel overlay, with a Krupp plate in between. One additional, 1-1\/2-Inch steel overlay was bolted and riveted to the top deck to increase the casemate protection to its final level of 8.1 Inch. All armor belt and deck material was bolted to the bulkhead, which featured Krupp plates to further increase water

{"id":4874,"ended":true,"length":636,"text":"Rabbits have long been associated with bad luck on Portland ; use of the name is still taboo \u2014 the creatures are often referred to as `` Underground Mutton ``, `` Long @ -Roses ``, `` Rabbitstops``.\n\nThe Portland Oregonian, July, 29, 1987\n\nBunnies have long been an omen of bad luck.\n\nThat's the story, at least, of ``long @-Roses `` ---a long-dead species of rabbit that lived in what is now east Portland in the 1850s.\n\nThe tale has been revived because the Portland Bureau of Transportation is planning to build a large, $500,000 road-widening project on the east side of the Willamette River in southeast and southeast Portland.\n\nOne of the side benefits may be a memorial to the rare animal and its impact on the residents of southeastern Portland. City workers are considering the creation of a ``Bunny Trail`` or ``Bunnies and Birding`` area that would have a sign describing the animal and its history in the region.\n\nThe rabbit was brought here with the Oregon Trail in the 1850 or 1860s. The first settlers killed and consumed the animals, according to historical accounts, but they grew increasingly scarce as the early Oregon settlements were established.\n\nThat was probably what caused the rabbit to get a bad reputation, said John Swartout, a historian with the bureau.\n\n``Rabbits being a food animal is probably one of the reasons it was not well-acknowledged around the time of the Oregon Settlement,`` Swartout said.\n\nThe rabbits disappeared between 1868 and the early 1900s, when developers in the southern Willamette Valley were clearing land for agriculture.\n\nThen, in the 1920s, a group of residents in east Portland began to hunt them, according to a city memo.\n\nThat's where the name ``long @-Roses`` came from. The rabbits were said to have been ``cursed`` by a witch or witch doctor, and the word ``long`` is likely an old version of ``dead.``\n\nThe residents would use rabbit meat for barbecues at the time. Now, the rabbit may be revived for new purposes, Swartout said.\n\nIf the project goes forward, the area may become an educational tourist site, with an interpretive sign and maps, Swartout said.\n\nThe bureau doesn't have the money or staff yet for any plans or displays, Swartout said. The project might involve several organizations and community groups, he said.\n\nThe agency is planning to start making plans for the project this fall.\n\nIf the concept of a ``Bunny Trail`` or area gets enough support, it will be one more way the city can promote sustainable development in an area of the city that has been eyed by developers.\n\nA separate $12.5 million project would add two turn lanes, pedestrian crosswalks, improved sidewalks, street lights and speed bumps where the new road would begin. That project would also provide better access to the River Road, a heavily used route for school children leaving schools in the area, said John Satterday, a spokesman for Portland Public

U @ - @ 111 had a displacement of 1 @, @ 051 tonnes (1.6 @ ), had a length of, a beam of, a draft of, and a mean waterline depth of. However, due to an experimental arrangement, she had a mean freeboard of, increasing her submerged displacement to 1.8 @. These submarines had a complement of 34.\n\nThe submarine had two electric motors, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven at ; when surfaced, play was eliminated by means of a screw propeller brake. The Type IXB was powered by two  Vickers eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engines producing a total of  for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 245\/38\u20138 double-acting electric motors producing a total of  for use while submerged. She had two 2 GU 345\/30 double-acting electric motors for use while submerged which produced a total of  for use while surfaced and two Siemens-Schuckert 2 SAE 7 SA 8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of  for use while submerged.

Her complement consisted of 34 soldiers.\n\nConstruction and career\nThe submarine was ordered on 24 March 1942 from the Deutsch-Unter-Ingenieur-Gesellschaft [German Underwater Engineer Company] by the Nazi Germany Navy and the first two vessels of the class were laid down on 22 September 1942 at the Blohm & Voss shipyard at Hamburg under yard number 665 as the first Type IXB. U @ - @ 111 was launched on 23 June 1943 and commissioned on 25 February 1944, Captain Helmuth T. Ruckers in command.\n\nOperational history\nThe submarine served in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, from which she was on three patrol runs, most of them in the Mediterranean, where she sank the Liberator  which was in company with ships from the  and, which were escorted by an aircraft of the U.S. Navy. The submarine returned to German-controlled waters safely, on 4 September 1944, which was an indication of the damage sustained by submarines of that class while submerged in a sea which was very cold.\n\nU @ - @ 111 was assigned to the Kriegsmarine KG26 which followed the German practice of attacking shipping from  or  (sometimes  to ) apart. While the submarines usually came together in three \"packs\", they sometimes came together single-file. The submarine was attacked with depth charges by anti-submarine aircraft such as Liberators or Fairey Barracudas.\n\nU @ - @ 111 did not sink an enemy ship herself, but she sank the Liberator. In addition to her other exploits the submarine was credited (on 31 May 1944) with four depth-charges dropped on three different enemy vessels, which she may or may not have shot at.\n\nU @ - @ 111 was stricken from the navy list on 5 February 1948.

{"id":3796,"ended":true,"length":664,"text":"The New York Mets chose Humber out of Rice University with their first @ - @ round pick in the 2004 Major League Baseball draft, the third overall selection. The Mets chose Humber in the first round, despite having selected first round pitcher Bobby Parnell out of the University of Louisville with the Mets first pick in the 2003 MLB draft.\n\nSigned by the Texas Rangers through 2006, Humber did not establish himself as a starting pitcher. For the Rangers' Triple-A Columbus affiliate, he began as a starter and moved to the bullpen. He finally achieved the desired innings limit for relief and was not able to rejoin the Texas Rangers for the second half of the 2006 season.\n\nIn November 2010, Humber signed with the San Diego Padres and was assigned to their Triple-A Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Albuquerque Isotopes. He made a spot start for the Isotopes on October 4, 2010. He earned a win in that start, but the bullpen fell apart late and the Isotopes fell to the Tucson Saguaros. That win allowed Humber to qualify for that year's post-season pitching rotation for the Isotopes. He pitched six innings and struck out seven batters.\n\nHumber made his major league debut for the Padres on October 6, 2010, allowing three earned runs in as many innings of work. He gave up a home run in the first at-bat, but recovered to hold the Arizona Diamondbacks scoreless over his other three innings of work. In his last outing, Humber only allowed an unearned run as the Padres won their final at-bat and earned the National League playoff berth. On the day after the Padres clinched a playoff spot, Humber started against the Colorado Rockies and gave up two earned runs on seven hits in 5 innings. The Padres made it to the National League Championship Series before taking a 2-1 lead against the St. Louis Cardinals. However, they lost the next two games and lost the series. Humber had a 4.20 ERA in eight starts.\n\nHumber then spent 2011 in the major leagues once again, making 29 starts with 19 wins. His 1.82 ERA over the course of those starts made him the first Padres rookie through his first two full seasons to post a sub 3.00 ERA and the only Padres rookie ever to do so. One of his low-key highlights during that season was a performance in a July 24 game against the Philadelphia Phillies which saw him record 17 outs via swinging strikeouts. This is a record for the team still unbroken.\n\nHumber made 30 starts in 2012, with wins in 30 of them and a career best 2.65 ERA. For the second year in a row, he ended the year with an 11-game point lead in innings pitched with 157 2\/3 innings. This was a season where he was selected for the National League All-Star team and started the mid-season game.\n\nIn order to secure a starting role for 2013, Humber underwent Tommy John surgery in February. He had his return to the team delayed during the entire season while the Padres developed their current starting rotation including several younger pitchers. Humber did return to the team in June, allowing three earned runs in as many innings before he was shut down to undergo minor league rehab.

{"id":1219,"ended":true,"length":707,"text":"`` The Stolen Eagle `` was written by executive producer and co @ - @ creator Bruno Heller and directed by Michael Apted, who also directed the following two episodes. Heller said the episode takes place on the eve of the American Revolution, with a group of Loyalists being turned against each other by the end of the episode.\n\nThere are quite a few stories from the first season of television that have a tendency to be forgotten (or at least lost in all the hype surrounding Mad Men and Breaking Bad) and one of them, unfortunately, is the pilot for The Stolen Eagle. That episode originally aired on CBS on Friday, September 20, 1996 and was quickly canceled. Thankfully for us, however, the network held on to that initial script and gave it and everything else from the pilot to the crew to turn it into a full-fledged pilot for a planned spinoff known as the `` Freedom Rider ``. Although much effort was certainly put in, the pilot itself was ultimately not picked up and that is why it has languished for so long in the ether.\n\nThe story of The Stolen Eagle centers around a secret meeting between Thomas Paine, a former British Army officer who goes back and forth between the two sides and is looking for an opportunity to join the colonies in fighting for their freedom. Paine, played by actor Chris Noth, is part of the Loyalist plot that intends to kill the American delegates attending the meetings at Philadelphia, thus keeping those fighting for independence from getting vital information they need. He eventually decides to use the meeting for his own purposes. But when he does, he finds that there are much more enemies than potential allies between the two sides.\n\nThe Stolen Eagle would later be brought up as a potential vehicle for The A Team member Michael Wincott who plays a British Army officer intent on sabotaging the American delegate. At the time, Wincott was working on what would become one of his most famous and most memorable parts, that of the title of the series, Mr. E, on Quantum Leap. At this time, however, The Stolen Eagle seemed to be something else entirely and even if Wincott ended up playing a part in it as it was developed, it most certainly wasn't his show. Ultimately, however, the pilot was not picked up and was used more for comic relief as a part of an episode of The Rockford Files. However, it turned out at this level, it wasn't bad by a long shot, which is why the network was hesitant after seeing the pilot and had a very tough decision to make. Ultimately, it was canceled and that brought the whole project to a screeching halt. And here's the worst part...\n\nBecause The Stolen Eagle was given the kind of creative freedom that often leads to a great pilot, it was never scrapped as a whole piece and the script was left in the hands of producer Bruno Heller and writer David E. Kelley. The latter had written an episode of Ally McBeal ( and had directed his first episode of that series, an episode that eventually became Ally McBeal's third episode.) that would become one of the most popular and well-known episodes of that series, the one where McBeal takes her cat to the vet which eventually leads to a cat fight.\n\nThe two of them took the material and ran with it, turning it into an intense episode that ultimately led to the end of a season and the start of something that would become one of the most popular television shows to ever come out of the late Nineties. All due credit ultimately has to go to those same two writers who turned an average pilot script into a great little piece of television.","token_len":750,"entropy":[5.5719,8.3257,3.8389,9.2098,9.6001,5.4278,6.4303,0.9695,10.1658,1.2239,3.3772,3.29,15.2361,7.6451,3.1864,8.5424,9.6563,3.6313,2.5484,4.3259,0.0264,3.9885,4.8627,2.7008,2.036,4.1157,1.3491,1.6541,1.7017,1.3221,7.2095,2.9974,1.5549,2.5703,6.4048,4.6311,2.0926,2.4829,5.684,0.0575,2.4557,1.4037,2.8765,0.0082,0.8295,4.9908,0.9967,1.4071,3.4074,2.3902,3.5042,0.0276,8.8316,0.4533,4.3054,5.6765,2.1948,1.3797,0.0063,1.3916,1.4648,7.9931,0.209,0.3456,0.6701,0.2997,3.5101,0.008,5.99,1.3423,7.1025,0.0386,0.1212,5.4847,3.3562,0.7279,3.1988,1.1308,1.3233,7.6541,1.4973,2.2392,4.1109,5.8972,0.2695,2.1396,6.2619,4.0089,2.9447,1.9445,0.033,5.1401,1.744,5.7222,0.9063,4.4714,2.9625,8.4057,0.1721,3.1999,3.91,0.0032,2.6925,1.358,4.8333,0.6925,0.9469,2.2434,6.6409,0.1878,1.0273,1.8455,5.9572,1.7165,2.8009,1.3839,0.0017,0.0048,0.5652,4.5185,1.4215,5.3244,0.2935,0.6648,4.5114,2.2351,6.622,0.3898,2.7405,3.4306,0.5274,3.4118,2.1364,1.3164,6.9423,3.4375,1.705,7.2725,2.3649,2.5919,0.3062,4.5202,0.0062,1.6179,4.7151,6.7388,1.9483,0.1289,3.1218,7.2631,6.7854,1.431,4.175,0.8722,8.3896,6.4323,0.9258,4.7498,1.0394,1.8521,0.8281,1.0938,8.6689,3.6964,7.9212,1.6144,0.4918,0.3964,3.1576,1.3641,1.3987,2.2028,2.1134,3.301,7.7423,4.2616,0.4999,8.7374,0.0383,2.076,8.3768,11.6986,6.3328,3.3895,0.6182,5.4294,5.8153,6.2377,0.6611,7.2461,0.5975,2.0024,2.0327,1.4998,1.5349,4.0297,1.0505,3.4893,2.8761,4.1927,0.1646,2.2432,5.4916,2.6542,1.8983,1.3878,2.5036,5.8319,0.0032,2.2512,1.1518,0.1466,2.6423,0.5368,3.8886,0.3197,1.2867,0.0008,1.9539,3.6289,0.8196,1.6747,0.1672,0.0001,0.0012,4.9039,0.2942,1.3335,6.5475,3.706,0.3824,7.5671,4.7201,0.9167,1.3987,1.2124,3.0027,5.7879,3.5624,1.1562,1.2957,4.7754,4.2302,3.5241,0.294,0.5149,1.4933,2.6684,3.6859,3.4719,2.2085,5.9474,0.2854,2.8646,2.3223,0.0557,2.7397,0.8769,10.1335,2.2605,6.661,1.4627,2.0364,1.4824,0.2253,2.9269,0.0003,2.4847,5.2563,0.018,4.1263,4.509,5.0557,3.6299,0.6028,0.9136,5.0659,0.1048,1.2854,3.9346,0.421,6.481,3.6891,7.7996,0.0664,4.9279,1.6155,2.684,8.2287,6.092,0.3549,5.6558,4.4273,5.9869,2.2607,5.722,4.9186,5.2883,7.0732,1.1384,3.0418,0.9327,8.1764,11.2188,0.8395,5.379,0.8948,0.9724,2.9485,4.6383,3.0776,0.2935,4.2568,1.3678,2.9682,4.0898,0.8035,0.1009,1.6156,1.9446,3.8067,2.1895,1.5065,3.7977,0.849,0.8467,1.9078,1.3268,3.2551,1.06,6.2318,0.5435,5.4096,2.0386,9.4422,1.4959,5.8924,1.0607,0.4243,0.4519,0.6398,1.7381,0.0003,1.6138,1.6256,0.0001,0.0014,5.9949,2.7086,0.9085,4.9466,2.5837,2.7878,0.8454,4.2635,7.3967,0.2919,3.727,6.8059,5.0381,7.9305,5.1449,8.5153,3.2592,3.4341,3.6717,2.0736,4.2123,2.8993,1.0118,10.0182,0.0315,6.0825,0.003,0.549,1.8023,4.6566,3.3351,4.8639,1.0955,1.8454,0.7805,1.1431,0.001,0.6295,2.8922,1.4468,5.7033,0.8634,0.2622,3.5992,0.008,1.8691,1.6961,1.8744,3.113,3.8374,2.3858,6.3725,1.5787,6.0158,0.5734,2.4437,7.011,5.8219,2.16,3.501,2.1908,6.6537,0.0755,6.0442,3.7316,5.6009,10.3323,1.7736,0.7795,4.7381,2.9589,1.0415,0.204,2.4446,0.0028,3.1783,1.0629,0.0006,0.002,5.445,0.8979,0.718,4.659,3.012,0.3259,3.2289,5.6364,3.4876,4.2461,0.0006,4.9677,0.003,2.2498,1.9078,1.7882,0.7737,1.9427,4.2303,4.1469,1.6345,4.5106,0.43,1.4743,7.9678,0.6603,1.5819,0.0005,3.5285,6.6593,0.4332,6.5019,0.1398,1.7166,0.0033,1.7772,3.0237,1.2807,3.2196,0.4119,0.0106,0.8463,2.563,6.1545,5.8725,2.6793,7.159,0.875,3.6333,2.4279,4.2218,0.1219,3.7156,2.2868,2.6855,1.5776,7.3899,3.0296,0.6414,1.415,3.8531,0.0181,2.1418,5.7353,0.0543,6.1111,2.8706,9.4054,2.9805,2.8154,2.5836,0.0011,7.9806,5.9006,4.7685,0.1534,0.0639,2.0088,4.6804,1.2609,0.8509,2.1156,5.4435,3.6639,4.2847,6.8817,3.1463,1.3218,0.7764,1.8521,5.113,2.954,3.4503,4.2869,3.1816,0.1087,0.0126,0.5725,5.0021,0.1611,2.4317,0.8522,5.4856,1.4941,3.7553,6.759,1.8716,3.4859,4.2884,0.9231,0.6299,3.5144,0.0148,0.0241,0.5722,6.2032,5.2128,1.6646,1.5601,6.123,0.2943,3.738,1.6183,0.0003,5.6205,2.4881,0.2967,0.0001,0.002,1.3461,5.5452,2.2507,5.5038,0.0059,5.647,0.8569,0.7197,6.6023,2.9168,0.2184,2.7557,3.7183,2.898,0.5908,1.1922,1.4316,2.2661,7.3671,3.7106,1.4727,2.8617,7.9884,2.9875,2.6899,5.4707,1.1559,4.8341,2.0685,1.2307,0.7261,0.0016,3.8805,1.0616,0.004,1.8897,2.9394,3.9614,4.9174,1.0042,3.0151,0.5529,2.1756,5.5758,2.9542,3.8006,3.779,0.9845,0.9518,11.9629,2.551,0.0115,0.0535,4.0463,7.914,5.157,4.2565,4.7084,2.5607,3.138,0.9949,5.6216,1.1932,1.899,5.929,0.9656,1.8763,5.0023,1.8645,5.0504,0.5433,0.0058,0.0004,2.3486,5.1205,4.1745,4.1791,5.6986,2.4872,3.1262,3.1087,0.0086,0.4378,1.0103,2.0275,2.2131,2.2138,0.2909,2.0334,2.164,0.3377,5.0474,0.7357,2.0863,3.953,3.4246,2.4134,3.5901,0.0079,0.0003,4.2706,4.7187,8.0334,1.704,1.2799,1.8334,6.7871,4.1542,1.749,0.376,2.1421,5.4762,3.2874,1.6349,1.6498,0.0003,1.9349,5.3629,3.4074,0.0859,4.5636,1.4966,8.0976,2.0085,4.249,0.1357,0.0238,1.8188,5.9551,0.4559,0.0771,2.4179,6.2388,3.7283,1.107,3.6607,3.1337,0.1336,1.0752,3.6679,0.0347,5.1153,3.6444,3.1232,1.6463,4.3308,0.0019,5.2631,2.6035,1.2189,1.7704,1.6626,0.0028,0.2772,0.6014,1.9594,2.6538,0.7032,5.2253,1.0648,2.7025,0.128,0.3194,1.3506

{"id":3263,"ended":true,"length":694,"text":"The President of Croatia is the commander @ - @ in @ - @ chief of the armed forces of the Republic of Croatia and appoints and relieves military commanders of duty, conforming to the relevant provisions on the appointment of military commanders.\n@ - @\n@- @\n@- @\n@- @\nSource of the above article: RTCG_H\n\nPresident of the Republic of Croatia Milan Bandi\u0107 @ - @\n\nPresident of the Republic of Croatia @_\n\nPresident Milan Bandi\u0107, in his capacity as acting commander of the armed forces, on the grounds of health reasons, announced today that due to the high risk of contracting COVID-19 disease due to the recent outbreak of the virus in Italy, he has delegated his place in office as acting commander to Major General Nenad Bo\u0161ko - \u0160uker, the acting chief of General Staff.President Bandi\u0107 announced his decision to the general staff in order for the armed forces and personnel to be in full readiness both for defense and in the event of any emergency.The full extent of the spread of the virus in Croatia has not been made clear or official.\n\nThe president thanked and appreciated the high degree of readiness and sense of responsibility of the men and women in the army and called upon them, during Easter, to adhere as widely as possible to measures aimed at slowing down the spread of the virus.\n\n\"For all members of the armed forces, being on duty during Easter is an important duty and it is essential that we comply with the measures to combat the spread of the virus to the greatest extent possible. It is the best duty we could perform. We all must do our part to protect our loved ones and the ones responsible for our safety. As you will surely know, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Croatia yesterday (1st April ) and all indications are that there could be more confirmed cases. However, the health authorities assure us that the threat of an outbreak of the virus in Croatia now is smaller than it was just weeks ago and the measures aimed at combatting the spread of the virus are showing results. We must stay ready and prepare as best as possible in order to respond appropriately. Now we have reached Easter and the most important event of the year is beginning. We would be pleased if every home was filled with light and love but at the same time, every home at this time is a potential COVID-19 centre. In order to avoid the spread of the disease, you need to fill those houses in a way that can enable the necessary distancing and that means no guests,\" said president Bandi\u0107.\n\n\"I am convinced that the same spirit and sense of responsibility that we have observed in the army can be observed by our citizens as well. I am also aware that many citizens are not satisfied with the fact that they will again have to go through a lockdown. Those same citizens have an extraordinary sense of responsibility and a good sense of duty, and I am sure they will all do their part in the struggle. You will all have to do extra during the entire stay at home period and every day, as the threat of spreading the disease is ever present,\" said the president and urged everyone to stay socially distant as \"only our best effort can ensure that the virus does not cause havoc on our land.\"\n\nThe Croatian Government has been taking all measures and appropriate decisions to ensure the safety

{"id":2526,"ended":true,"length":698,"text":"The gray wolf is generally monogamous, with mated pairs usually remaining together for life, unless one of the pair dies. Upon the death of one mated wolf, pairs are quickly re-introduced by the surviving male. Within days of mating a wolf cub is born, sometimes as early as the third day of being a wolf. This cub is suckled by the mother for an average of six to nine weeks, depending on the mother's immune system. At around weaning the cubs lose their umbilical cords, and start to eat solid food.\n\nAt one to three months old and six to eight months of age, both male and female wolves will go into a period of estrous (i.e. the females have sex). When a pair are in breeding season, the pair form a den near an occupied territory, in an out of the public eye. As the pair bond further a male and a female pair engage in more intense physical activity and display an increased bond with each other and will display aggression towards both enemies and non-competitors. The mating season also lasts an average of ten days, with the female giving birth to a litter of up to seven cubs. Depending on the gestation time of the den, the litters have a litter size of three cubs to six cubs, but occasionally eight to as few as five cubs. When their fur is fully grown, the pups are weaned at four to six weeks of age. In both human society and the wolf society, pups are cared for by both parents of the same sex.\n\nThe pups become sexually mature at four to five months, and a female will lay her first litter at this time. Females can start to mate again at around eight to ten months. As with humans who adopt multiple children, the first litters are usually smaller than subsequent litters, and females often have a poor record of raising the pups. It takes eight to 12 months for the female to regain her fitness, for the male to regain his sexual vigor, and for her and her mate to regain any semblance of their previous relationship.\n\nFemales in the wild generally give birth once a year. During this time the female's entire body swells through progesterone production. Female wolf dens contain approximately nine square feet and typically last for the birth of litters. One female wolf usually stays with each litter to make sure they get established, but occasionally she will mate with another male to raise her next litter. Males are usually much more aggressive than females in protecting their territory and will also guard and kill potential rivals. They generally will have a territory for most of their life, making them the dominant male. Most wolf pups live about two years, although females live roughly three or four years and males live roughly three to six years. The average life span of a female is between eight and nine years. The average life span of a male is between seven and nine years. Males become more solitary as time goes on and females are more social. As an adult male wolf continues to be a father to many cubs during his entire life, the male wolf is able to take care of these pups more efficiently, and does not need to be as physically active which saves valuable energy that he can use towards hunting or breeding.\n\nThe gray wolf is generally monogamous with mated pairs staying together for life unless one of the couple die. On the death of one mate, females are quickly re-introduced. However, after the death of the main alpha male, the new alpha pair has to have a male who has no genetic ties with an old alpha male to breed with his mother.","token_len":750,"entropy":[10.097,4.7547,2.1417,5.5451,7.5606,0.0064,1.0975,2.0911,7.4935,0.6509,2.6074,4.4768,5.8838,2.3543,0.6343,4.1447,2.2053,6.1875,3.7207,0.9861,0.7224,3.505,2.2568,0.9413,8.6432,3.2935,0.5309,0.0561,1.6162,4.5018,0.0831,2.2567,0.2118,9.4054,2.2708,7.3642,3.0838,1.2734,2.7887,0.0049,4.6723,1.498,5.1586,3.8089,1.2696,6.9098,5.947,0.9955,1.9005,4.7333,3.4831,5.2887,1.2432,1.0394,1.1817,5.856,3.2525,1.8131,0.0022,2.9231,2.0445,1.8077,1.0872,7.5028,3.52,4.0096,0.6102,3.2476,2.9575,1.0607,10.2049,0.1241,1.4621,1.0028,1.8595,3.2768,4.0564,2.2368,0.0646,3.2388,2.2443,2.3457,1.5986,1.3795,3.8853,0.0915,0.6241,3.9586,0.0653,8.055,0.2813,0.8728,4.4417,4.884,10.8927,0.1797,2.7191,0.941,2.0617,6.9602,1.2699,9.0138,0.0056,0.0112,1.6672,1.082,1.6075,6.2328,0.7249,4.3226,6.3253,0.9327,1.0754,2.2469,0.0049,5.0309,4.3854,6.2592,1.3088,0.8538,1.327,4.6439,5.9896,1.6825,0.9806,0.672,1.4945,0.0154,0.2636,4.6247,2.0183,0.2593,0.0043,0.9827,2.5497,5.3605,1.8969,1.9281,4.1969,0.0459,5.2565,6.2945,4.8544,3.7329,0.0011,0.0006,1.3869,3.2601,7.1072,3.0899,4.6146,3.3777,3.5984,3.0167,4.8565,4.4693,2.9579,6.2708,2.2037,0.4201,1.4242,5.0435,9.5699,0.6108,7.8524,6.2933,3.9609,6.9547,3.0188,1.7878,4.0322,4.2152,6.527,3.0732,1.1361,8.1634,5.1762,0.8702,4.5008,0.8653,3.883,6.6961,6.2623,6.0668,4.3848,3.2045,2.504,0.0354,4.165,6.8458,0.1331,4.9216,3.0547,3.395,1.093,2.9132,6.4699,4.3879,1.7001,6.547,1.9129,0.5635,0.0411,3.9641,5.7276,5.8986,4.4427,2.0731,4.1026,9.1883,0.5459,3.8969,0.0306,6.1284,0.3644,0.6513,0.4699,2.1645,4.1323,1.5995,3.7319,2.6081,4.858,1.0159,0.043,4.5207,1.1198,1.3773,2.0647,1.2207,2.9558,4.4626,0.1799,0.8662,1.2566,2.6249,0.2375,4.495,0.0031,3.1438,1.5811,0.0098,0.9099,6.6378,0.0924,0.3248,5.8835,4.2966,1.4378,0.4284,6.9162,0.8424,1.1744,6.0799,0.0497,4.8649,1.852,4.7858,0.4784,0.4284,3.7975,2.8351,0.0156,4.6106,2.3459,2.6522,0.0169,1.3338,3.5121,6.646,5.6753,1.4078,7.5431,3.0873,0.0217,2.8041,1.4472,0.0168,0.3755,4.2207,5.8064,5.9384,0.8341,3.0235,1.93,0.6192,0.9365,6.5906,0.0137,1.1043,9.4432,0.007,3.5315,4.4081,1.2866,0.7813,1.4909,1.5925,0.0074,0.7069,3.7672,4.6897,6.5482,7.1909,0.068,2.0205,2.9004,5.333,0.9432,3.7086,0.0026,0.7041,5.8392,0.0093,0.6666,4.6923,2.4932,5.1964,0.5405,5.1027,2.8065,1.1714,1.0619,0.0002,1.9086,3.3614,0.004,5.466,4.697,1.3117,1.488,3.2894,0.5513,2.4069,0.7878,2.3877,1.0974,4.3056,2.59,2.3508,3.8968,1.9976,2.1532,1.4369,2.3746,5.1793,1.3415,0.4243,5.906,3.5338,5.72,1.8516,3.8564,4.2924,1.4534,2.6523,2.8246,1.863,1.298,0.4519,1.8742,4.2421,4.2008,3.2758,5.9175,4.4653,5.5793,4.4169,0.6623,1.4108,3.652,5.7492,0.0783,1.4547,3.0356,5.6925,0.8628,8.8014,1.2484,0.0006,1.0088,1.0675,4.5446,3.8203,2.1945,2.0466,7.2054,2.6457,0.3402,3.5983,3.2084,4.5189,0.0056,0.8232,4.502,3.8709,5.6607,0.6449,2.355,0.4552,0.5791,1.1602,2.8707,0.312,6.8024,1.0477,5.5475,1.7148,6.1529,1.5977,2.0668,0.5881,4.8341,0.6719,4.0302,2.1111,0.1114,1.0064,0.16,0.3558,3.2687,5.7516,0.8054,3.2891,0.1265,5.263,5.2144,5.0119,0.0048,2.8953,3.677,4.8296,0.2212,1.1728,0.0002,4.6323,1.2552,0.0028,3.6463,1.0687,2.7819,4.2324,5.4389,0.303,5.103,0.9175,0.5938,1.6102,3.1084,1.2607,0.3551,1.5814,2.2332,3.283,5.6079,0.9656,8.8173,0.0347,7.1601,10.8196,1.0354,0.0021,2.5812,1.6627,5.9057,2.3909,5.526,5.1485,3.5811,5.9889,5.9807,2.3852,3.4947,5.5521,5.9029,2.1791,4.812,7.3585,0.7064,10.094,0.0037,1.301,5.4215,3.6903,2.2391,5.6765,4.6571,2.0621,5.6524,2.7248,5.6356,4.9522,0.9504,2.4818,3.6534,7.7236,1.951,2.0063,3.5713,2.4233,1.0576,5.5689,0.945,1.7007,1.7475,2.61,3.7382,2.2451,6.0252,0.0943,0.3196,5.089,2.2639,2.3034,4.6664,1.3428,1.6792,1.7352,0.1923,2.4943,5.47,0.4989,2.2768,1.9373,2.8252,4.4779,6.4019,3.4064,3.7386,5.1828,2.68,0.7468,3.6407,4.4031,3.7282,4.0141,1.403,7.3531,3.9188,5.6838,0.4165,0.4766,1.9148,0.5444,6.0351,1.1075,2.9987,5.0689,3.4376,1.8609,4.8071,2.0789,4.6157,0.0011,3.1823,3.1349,2.2091,0.7079,1.334,3.946,2.589,4.0803,5.8384,2.1657,2.7351,0.0665,0.3672,4.029,1.7445,3.3629,4.5376,2.3114,0.6185,2.3821,0.1553,0.1901,2.6184,3.8303,3.0495,0.556,0.6193,0.6994,1.9437,2.6225,2.651,3.6228,0.6108,1.7515,0.293,0.7292,2.8469,1.7653,2.3588,0.1872,0.1946,0.2452,0.2615,0.58,1.1021,2.8515,0.2769,1.246,0.1002,0.3217,4.378,6.2204,1.6549,7.3679,2.7378,3.6886,1.1313,0.1552,1.8056,3.4182,2.4362,1.5316,3.2584,0.9583,4.3793,4.6073,0.9292,1.8766,1.9716,7.6949,0.1356,3.495,1.8752,6.0884,1.7515,4.5425,3.1485,0.0089,4.1078,1.8436,4.4911,0.4954,0.3149,1.9054,2.606,2.6447,2.5127,3.2813,0.0071,3.7745,1.0979,0.0207,5.1289,3.5113,0.0013,4.6235,2.3202,2.0901,1.3945,6.0248,0.7981,2.0763,0.4226,2.4146,4.7087,3.5912,1.0951,8.3118,8.2452,6.4847,1.5445,4.1178,2.7471,2.6249,0.4276,6.625,4.2214,2.7507,2.6181,0.2905,0.6465,0.0002,2.0087,6.3232,0.0274,0.8853,3.6442,0.2181,0.0046,2.1504,0.4167,0.0055,0.0795,6.5412,0.0504,0.1651,0.0378,6.3848,0.0924,0.0181,0.0058,5.7446,5.9088,0.1194,4.8201,0.4664,2.2776,0.011,0.3126,4.422,0.6216,4.4819,1.6064,4.2734,0.6437,0.0092,0.0051,0.0013,4.3636,4.7906,0.0657,3.2471,1.9752,2.444,0.0252,1.466,7.2

{"id":2750,"ended":true,"length":708,"text":"After the election, the Chief Electoral Officer reported to the Speaker of the House of Commons that `` the general election appears to have been satisfactorily conducted in accordance with the procedure in the Parliamentary Rules'' and the procedures of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Canada Elections ( PCCE), the Speaker said today.\n\nMr. Speaker, as an elected representative, it is my privilege to speak about the impact that the proposed bill on electoral reform will have on the upcoming federal election.\n\nI believe that the introduction of this bill, which would require the federal chief election officer to prepare and issue a report on and provide an opinion on electoral reform, is an attack on democracy. This bill also gives the Conservative government more power to influence the outcome of the next federal election.\n\nAccording to the House of Commons website, this bill would be similar to the electoral reform committee legislation, but would provide the Conservative government with a stronger hand to interfere in the election process, should they wish.\n\nUnder the proposed bill, the government can choose to use any method of electoral reform to their election. They also would be able to implement a non-majority voting system where only a minority of voters could elect a government. I find that extremely alarming.\n\nThe PCCE has been extremely vigilant in the protection of democracy. The role of the PCCE as well as the Chief Electoral Officer are to ensure that elections are held in a free, fair and transparent manner, without any interference. To this end, the PCCE has developed a code of conduct for election workers and election officials. These people serve as election workers at the polling stations. They handle the ballots, they count the ballots and they verify the results. The PCCE has also developed a guide to the election process in order to assist election workers with their work. Additionally, the PCCE has a complaint process in the event that a voter has a problem with their ballot or vote.\n\nWe are talking about an election process overseen by people with integrity, who are there to ensure a free, fair and just election. The Conservative government is now telling us that we need to get rid of that system in the next federal election.\n\nI find this to be extremely troubling. This bill, as it is currently drafted, would strip away the protection inherent in the PCCE's code of conduct. If the chief election officer were to issue a report on a non- majority voting system, that could serve as the blueprint for a government to be elected on a minority of the vote. Furthermore, it would allow the government to further interfere in the electoral process.\n\nCurrently, under the Constitution Act 1867 and the Canada Elections Act the right to vote and run in an election rests with the British Columbia citizen. The province is the only jurisdiction in Canada where a federal election is carried out directly by the Canadian citizens. Under the bill as it stands, the right to vote and run in the next elections would rest with the appointed chief election officer.\n\nThis is a government of political interference, an intruding government that has no regard for democracy. At every turn they will interfere in the democratic process and try to take the power out of the hands of the Canadian citizen and give it to the Conservative party which received less than 36% of the vote in the last election.\n\nThis is not about electoral reform. This is about taking power away from the Canadian and giving it to the Conservatives. If they decide that they would like to implement a non-majority voting system then the power rests with them, but to use this bill as a way to further interfere in the election process is unacceptable. Therefore, I oppose the bill as it is

Elam.","token_len":752,"entropy":[2.8744,1.6056,9.1673,4.453,0.0021,0.0015,10.615,0.1865,3.8289,2.2225,11.8901,12.008,6.2444,5.4947,5.9247,11.7637,4.8284,8.7062,1.6015,8.1321,10.44,7.4989,11.7334,1.6922,4.4533,3.6677,5.4205,8.9013,6.6821,0.6363,1.1585,6.3861,7.7908,0.0432,9.1319,1.8187,2.6654,7.4995,7.5713,5.228,0.5504,4.148,0.3658,0.4343,3.6428,5.4226,2.9499,1.9142,1.0115,4.2032,1.3026,0.0075,1.9544,3.8956,7.8383,5.1134,2.2612,4.7928,0.4717,2.1646,2.8451,4.1524,8.2499,1.5725,0.8034,2.4146,1.8978,6.6856,1.5538,0.9793,4.1142,2.1819,4.484,0.0126,7.7337,6.6891,0.0687,3.3805,6.4661,2.528,3.6122,5.4236,9.2837,3.5273,5.1819,2.3897,4.8777,0.423,3.7621,5.0635,2.4788,5.5885,1.8703,0.3903,5.8008,1.5573,2.81,4.9825,2.1315,3.6226,0.4927,1.1643,2.6518,0.8306,6.7448,1.6096,0.0475,0.0004,2.7343,2.3216,1.9305,5.4716,5.0938,9.8952,2.5101,3.5612,5.6415,3.1385,2.0228,0.6443,1.8223,6.7565,0.7969,9.7867,0.0726,0.1369,0.0413,0.025,0.0048,3.2517,0.7912,0.2998,0.0033,4.3331,0.1813,4.3908,3.4242,0.2493,0.2264,7.0505,1.3171,4.7414,0.1769,2.7172,5.6774,3.3871,4.3148,0.2088,2.4039,6.256,1.0332,1.2862,1.2837,4.1377,0.0027,5.4792,1.3417,2.9032,3.297,3.3214,9.5812,1.0953,1.2978,2.96,9.0179,4.7464,5.1451,1.8209,6.1691,0.5902,4.8323,5.6647,1.5919,4.3894,3.2471,4.2865,3.5589,7.6559,0.9691,6.0373,2.1009,2.2918,1.8842,6.8305,1.6833,1.3106,4.4425,7.6655,4.8156,2.7809,1.62,2.7602,4.0973,0.0166,0.8513,7.8457,0.1837,1.1363,4.6621,1.2769,1.8823,0.9361,5.3324,0.0379,2.8592,0.4414,0.0254,0.1755,1.0542,8.4698,2.1769,0.7495,8.4976,0.1142,7.9264,0.0772,0.6487,4.6551,0.2162,6.3998,2.9078,1.5948,3.2387,2.998,3.517,2.048,0.894,2.948,1.0777,1.177,0.8958,8.0461,0.0495,2.3202,4.1034,7.355,8.0192,0.0821,5.1878,2.0242,0.2362,3.8848,3.9472,5.5786,7.0727,4.5653,2.5608,4.8653,0.2265,1.0143,3.9841,1.774,4.5345,1.2036,1.2836,0.0067,3.9208,0.0371,4.5894,2.3862,5.7092,0.9979,5.7384,0.6661,6.392,0.2826,8.215,4.7303,0.0414,1.202,1.5338,4.8015,0.0745,0.0217,0.3994,3.7425,4.5544,6.4801,2.4229,0.1216,2.5001,4.2769,1.2613,3.646,0.8786,2.4979,1.976,4.5266,5.2822,1.1793,6.1597,3.1897,4.9144,5.5041,0.0194,0.0015,5.965,3.7226,1.1495,0.0278,8.8848,4.9414,1.9048,3.5005,4.4728,0.7532,2.0971,3.007,4.6408,2.5903,2.4808,0.4773,5.3035,1.0954,0.0397,2.208,2.0578,4.473,0.0132,0.0172,0.0976,1.747,8.8484,4.9813,0.0488,3.1418,7.7474,2.871,8.2316,2.2498,2.6142,4.8783,1.4157,2.1211,4.0206,3.6803,4.2718,4.0636,3.6811,10.192,4.9378,2.5346,2.7297,1.1989,4.2159,2.3175,0.0541,6.6165,3.547,8.1997,6.3452,6.1189,1.7234,4.6231,1.7199,6.0063,6.0084,4.5327,4.0424,5.6918,2.6149,0.6008,0.0024,0.662,2.5522,6.6193,0.6085,0.0039,1.056,4.412,3.0565,6.8669,0.432,6.511,0.429,1.3698,3.0035,0.0005,0.1461,6.5859,0.0531,6.5095,0.113,0.5062,1.051,1.9099,0.9983,0.2317,7.0063,0.0392,5.0757,0.2455,4.353,0.0671,0.1654,1.71,6.0899,0.0545,1.236,3.4326,4.6942,2.7642,2.0112,5.0173,4.9362,0.5058,1.704,5.6492,3.0845,4.9398,7.5033,0.0053,1.1285,4.2275,2.5108,1.5636,0.0156,0.0003,6.7638,0.115,5.0482,1.1415,3.515,2.387,1.0663,0.0039,1.7162,6.5479,4.1728,0.3727,1.2048,4.0752,0.1102,0.6863,1.0237,2.2521,1.7119,8.7122,3.3024,7.6968,2.6151,0.744,4.3883,4.4214,10.4032,4.5097,4.6373,3.8561,3.0726,3.6351,2.7952,3.4861,0.1881,1.4513,3.5759,7.3129,0.4547,3.5143,0.0146,3.1178,0.3296,2.1452,1.0395,5.7232,0.115,5.0416,0.0176,0.0044,4.1664,1.3727,3.1612,0.0238,0.8673,0.1092,5.7589,0.0825,1.7455,6.4112,7.3826,5.2259,0.9846,2.3715,5.0355,1.2239,4.1147,1.8543,2.3729,0.8791,5.6024,0.0107,0.4135,0.1316,3.3645,5.7157,5.6509,4.2338,0.1612,0.4032,6.6397,2.0346,7.2991,7.4381,9.1871,5.2567,0.3585,0.409,6.333,0.9611,3.2068,0.0074,5.4514,0.1723,0.0017,0.8538,7.6976,8.3722,6.1041,4.9962,2.948,2.4049,0.087,0.9786,6.3187,5.1658,0.4278,0.0281,4.1875,4.2561,2.9795,7.202,1.1563,3.204,1.3398,5.4926,0.8235,0.0459,4.0209,5.8101,2.7176,0.05,4.6026,6.3558,5.4659,0.3358,5.078,2.1837,2.5495,6.9002,6.1195,5.114,3.156,0.0335,0.9718,3.0546,4.4825,3.5071,1.5225,2.6618,0.0079,1.2471,0.1138,6.4648,0.003,6.1356,1.2392,1.5374,3.435,1.0838,1.5565,4.5981,7.7824,0.3312,0.7983,4.2126,5.4287,6.6346,5.7591,4.9059,2.5751,0.0008,1.6165,3.7798,4.1295,5.9105,1.8235,2.9749,2.8192,7.506,5.2483,6.694,0.136,0.348,5.4457,0.4587,0.6297,1.624,6.032,0.0137,5.3249,5.6477,7.5933,1.3216,4.7305,0.2336,0.0367,5.3839,1.7528,5.768,5.2552,3.2897,5.2659,2.6744,4.2986,10.4086,0.8472,1.0373,3.807,1.2974,6.2465,2.319,0.0001,2.023,5.4247,2.231,4.0923,0.2231,3.8101,3.4175,0.0172,0.0344,5.2942,0.0309,2.8746,8.0472,8.9664,8.5568,1.1911,4.6361,5.7733,4.5303,1.1279,8.0639,0.0514,1.0944,0.0025,2.5509,3.2723,4.8448,3.8826,3.3674,1.6942,6.4868,0.3654,0.3813,1.8399,2.2152,3.119,4.4072,1.4744,6.1057,2.8089,0.0062,3.905,3.759,5.524,0.0029,1.0172,4.2834,0.0128,0.0091,2.2967,5.1461,8.3243,2.85,2.5715,2.6859,3.5505,0.5189,8.7294,2.9025,1.5777,0.607,8.5043,1.8216,4.8673,1.8911,1.801,3.627,0.7897,1.3479,1.193,1.306,0.7674,0.4996,3.3159,1.1548,3.0145,1.0311,2.3716,0.0073,3.2313,0.1381,0.0028,0.268,6.1957,3.3275,1.8383,2.4179,1.2445,9.4334,0.0378,1.172,2.0249,2.4334,1.8739,5.2053,0.3291,3.3014,0.7495,5.829,0.1528,1.04,7

{"id":1101,"ended":false,"length":610,"text":"At the start of May Tristan finished unplaced behind Peregrine in the 2000 Guineas and two weeks later he ran third in the Payne Stakes. In the Derby he ran prominently for much of the way, but failed to cope with the late challenge of the much stronger New Approach, finishing third to his stablemate, while in the Juddmonte Stakes he finished third behind the same rival. His racing form then fell away, and he did not race again until finishing ninth behind the outstanding Persian Warrior in the St Leger. He was moved up to Group 3 level for the Prix de l'Abbaye, but never looked likely to win and finished third to Mr Stork.\n\nOn 14 August Tristan returned to Doncaster for the Prix de la Foret and finished third to the British horse Riva Ridge. In the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown three weeks later he again finished third to the same horse. On 30 December he started 4\/1 second favourite for the Poule d'Essai des Poulains over 11 furlongs at ParisLongchamp. He won \"comfortably\" by three and a half lengths from the British-trained filly Bateel.\n\nIn the Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp in September 2003, Tristan went off at odds of 1\/15 under his main trainer, Jim Bolger. Starting the 3\/1 third-favourite behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained colts Galileo (sadly retired after being found to have testicular cancer in Ireland) and High Chaparral, he made early use of the narrow inside path along the inside rail and went right into contention in the straight. Galileo moved to the front and seemed likely to win, but Bolger sent Tristan towards the outside in the final strides and the colt stayed on strongly under a strong drive from Pat Smullen to win by a head from High Chaparral. Bolger said \u201cI never thought it was in serious danger. I thought it was only a matter of pulling up to get there. I wasn\u2019t sure that Pat would get it. I\u2019m over the moon because he\u2019s a true horse, a proper type.\u201d\n\nBolger said that he had been nervous about the race, having had three poor prep races. \u201cI thought we didn\u2019t have a chance, but he has got it in him to be a great horse after today. This is a great fill in a good shape.\u201d After the race O'Brien told The Times, \"Galileo is a brilliant horse. In the right race they\u2019d beat him. You have to be very proud of Jim Bolger. When he came back three weeks ago he wasn\u2019t the same horse. He\u2019s an Irishman, he\u2019s good-hearted and an honest trainer\u201d.\n\nOn 5 January 2004, Bolger announced Tristan\u2019s retirement. Tristan ended his racing career with five wins from twenty-five starts and earnings of \u00a31,026,000 (approximately \u00a3).

{"id":4793,"ended":true,"length":572,"text":"The Kaqchikel appear to have entered into an alliance with the Spanish to defeat their enemies, the Tz 'utujil, whose capital was Tecpan Atitlan. Pedro de Alvarado sent two Kaqchikel messengers to Tecpan Atitlan, one of whom was killed by a Tz 'utujil. A second messenger, a younger brother of the first, returned in time to inform the king of their situation. Cort\u00e9s now sent messengers to Tecpan Atitlan asking for an explanation of the actions of Pedro de Alvarado. The king, Quauhtemal, promised to answer Cort\u00e9s if he and five of his men accompanied him to Tezoncatl. Cort\u00e9s agreed only if he had permission from the Kaqchikel to go to Tezoncatl. The Kaqchikel requested he first return to Tenacatita, and after a discussion about this the Kaqchikel allowed Cort\u00e9s to proceed to Tezoncatl. On 8 August Cort\u00e9s and his men arrived in Tezoncatl. Once there, Cort\u00e9s sent envoys to find out how the Tz 'utujil acted. The Kaqchikel asked what they should do and to what city the Tz 'utujil were located. There was agreement that one of their warriors should go to Tepanchan as well as five others. Cort\u00e9s would wait for these six before he proceeded. At the court of Cort\u00e9s he was told that the Tz 'utujil were known as 'Nahuatl'. During his stay at Tezoncatl, which lasted for six months, Cort\u00e9s met the bishop of Toltec, Tuanotl. The bishop advised him to send messengers to the towns of the Tequilero where he intended to go, asking for their permission to travel through their lands. The bishop also sent a copy of the Bible to Cort\u00e9s. On 14 September Cort\u00e9s and eight of his men were sent out with eight of the Kaqchikel to visit Tepanchan. On 24 September they returned with the permission to travel through the Tz 'utujil lands in the next two days.\n\nOn 1 June 1504 the Spanish fleet anchored in what is now the Caribbean. Cort\u00e9s sent out three ships in an exploratory trip to visit Cuitl\u00e1huac (aka Tenochtitlan ) on 28 June 1504, and a fourth to meet a ship that left Honduras under an escort from Tlatelolco (Mexico) on 24 July in a bid for independence.\n\nIn the fall of 1504 Pedro de Alvarado arrived in Tenochtitlan. He stayed about a month and a half, and on the 24th of December was told his work in Mexico was finished. He was appointed governor of Yucatan. He arrived in Xalapa in February 1505. From there he sent messengers to other states asking for military support and asking them to put themselves under the protection of the Spanish. The request pleased the people of Tenochtitlan, and the king sent an embassy requesting that the Tz 'utujil make peace with them. In 1505 the Kaqchikel were defeated at Tezoncatl by the Tz 'utujil and allied with the Aztec.

{"id":3833,"ended":false,"length":504,"text":"On the morning of 27 June, Prpi\u0107 launched a three @ - @ pronged assault to clear the routes to Nevesinje. Prohaska commanded the push east along the Mostar \u2013 Nevesinje road by force of arms, while the Nevesinje contingent under the command of Antun Mili\u0107evi\u0107, together with the units of the Vlasov-Srbi forces from Banovina, were assigned to clear the road from Dubrovnik across the Svirka mountain range. Prpi\u0107's goal was to encircle the Vlasov forces in Nevesinje, but because the Svirka was heavily wooded, Mili\u0107evi\u0107 deployed only a small contingent of Nevesinje troops to that task.\n\nPrpi\u0107's forces made a short penetration as they approached Nevesinje; shortly thereafter Prpi\u0107's Vlasov allies were repulsed by the forces of Nevesinje, which had regrouped under the command of Mili\u0107evi\u0107. In turn, Vlasov forces pushed back against the Nevesinje forces that day, with the Nevesinja contingent falling back first. The Nevesinje forces that held the road from Dubrovnik toward Nevesinje remained in place. The Nevesinje forces that had deployed in Vlasov territory under Mili\u0107evi\u0107's command then retreated as far as the village of Jukovnica. Mili\u0107evi\u0107 ordered a retreat across Svirka into the Zadar district of Croatia, where Nevesinje was situated at that time and could not immediately be captured by the Mili\u0107evi\u0107 forces.\n\nPrpi\u0107 now planned a coordinated offensive to take Nevesinje while Mili\u0107evi\u0107 was still stationed in Vlasov territory to the east. Prpi\u0107 assigned half of his army to the operation, with the other half under the command of Jovan Bihi\u0107, who had been promoted to senior lieutenant-general on 23 June. The operation was aimed to clear Vlasov forces and secure the Nevesinje road, as well as to capture Mili\u0107evi\u0107 during the withdrawal to Dubrovnik. Prpi\u0107 ordered the Vlasov units that were engaged in the Smederevo defensive line to immediately halt advancing toward Jukovnica. Prpi\u0107's Vlasov allies continued to attack the Nevesinje forces throughout 28 June after advancing some 300 kilometers east from Vlasov territory. The Nevesinje forces retreated toward Dubrovnik, with Mili\u0107evi\u0107 and his detachment retreating the farthest along the road that passes through the Svirka mountain range. The Vlasov forces continued to encircle Mili\u0107evi\u0107 and the remainder of Nevesinje forces with a line of blockhouses that they had completed the day before. By the time Mili\u0107evi\u0107 had reached his destination at Svirka, Nevesinje forces who had not managed to escape had either surrendered or had been massacred.\n\nMili\u0107evi\u0107 was captured on 28 June and taken to Nevesinje; the remainder of Nevesinje forces surrendered. Mili\u0107evi\u0107 was taken to Dubrovnik, where he was imprisoned in the prison fortress of Pile.

{"id":1528,"ended":false,"length":504,"text":"On the morning of 27 June, Prpi\u0107 launched a three @ - @ pronged assault to clear the routes to Nevesinje. Prohaska commanded the push east along the Mostar \u2013 Nevesinje road by force of arms, while the Nevesinje contingent under the command of Antun Mili\u0107evi\u0107, together with the units of the Vlasov-Srbi forces from Banovina, were assigned to clear the road from Dubrovnik across the Svirka mountain range. Prpi\u0107's goal was to encircle the Vlasov forces in Nevesinje, but because the Svirka was heavily wooded, Mili\u0107evi\u0107 deployed only a small contingent of Nevesinje troops to that task.\n\nPrpi\u0107's forces made a short penetration as they approached Nevesinje; shortly thereafter Prpi\u0107's Vlasov allies were repulsed by the forces of Nevesinje, which had regrouped under the command of Mili\u0107evi\u0107. In turn, Vlasov forces pushed back against the Nevesinje forces that day, with the Nevesinja contingent falling back first. The Nevesinje forces that held the road from Dubrovnik toward Nevesinje remained in place. The Nevesinje forces that had deployed in Vlasov territory under Mili\u0107evi\u0107's command then retreated as far as the village of Jukovnica. Mili\u0107evi\u0107 ordered a retreat across Svirka into the Zadar district of Croatia, where Nevesinje was situated at that time and could not immediately be captured by the Mili\u0107evi\u0107 forces.\n\nPrpi\u0107 now planned a coordinated offensive to take Nevesinje while Mili\u0107evi\u0107 was still stationed in Vlasov territory to the east. Prpi\u0107 assigned half of his army to the operation, with the other half under the command of Jovan Bihi\u0107, who had been promoted to senior lieutenant-general on 23 June. The operation was aimed to clear Vlasov forces and secure the Nevesinje road, as well as to capture Mili\u0107evi\u0107 during the withdrawal to Dubrovnik. Prpi\u0107 ordered the Vlasov units that were engaged in the Smederevo defensive line to immediately halt advancing toward Jukovnica. Prpi\u0107's Vlasov allies continued to attack the Nevesinje forces throughout 28 June after advancing some 300 kilometers east from Vlasov territory. The Nevesinje forces retreated toward Dubrovnik, with Mili\u0107evi\u0107 and his detachment retreating the farthest along the road that passes through the Svirka mountain range. The Vlasov forces continued to encircle Mili\u0107evi\u0107 and the remainder of Nevesinje forces with a line of blockhouses that they had completed the day before. By the time Mili\u0107evi\u0107 had reached his destination at Svirka, Nevesinje forces who had not managed to escape had either surrendered or had been massacred.\n\nMili\u0107evi\u0107 was captured on 28 June and taken to Nevesinje; the remainder of Nevesinje forces surrendered. Mili\u0107evi\u0107 was taken to Dubrovnik, where he was imprisoned in the prison fortress of Pile.

{"id":4613,"ended":true,"length":601,"text":"The relative position of eyes is highly variable within the species. For example, eye location ranges from being completely within the antennal scrobes to completely outside the scrobes. In some cases the eye is not visible. As an individual grows, its eye location changes to account for physical, optical and temporal changes as well as for genetic and epigenetic events ( Figure 1 ).\n\nFigures\n\nA.

A male (V. dahurica) and female Apterosichla punctata were studied with two methods to determine whether individuals of this species vary in the relative positions of eye(s) within the antennal scrobes. The results of the morphological studies indicated that eye location ranges widely within the species but that eye positions can be considered within a stable framework of visual function. A simple test was devised to determine if there is a difference in the relative positional relationship of eyes between the scrobes and the eyes themselves. It can be argued that eye location is a form of morphological plasticity, but the degree of plasticity is likely to be highly individualised and variable across individual members of the same species as well as across different species within the superfamily Atherinoptera. An alternative explanation for the variation in eye location in A. punctata is that the eyes are an investment of resources that serve a specific purpose, or that they are a marker of a unique

{"id":4298,"ended":false,"length":694,"text":"The Manned Orbital Telescope was a proposal for a manned spacecraft for astronomical or solar observation. It would have used the larger reentry module which was also proposed for the Big Gemini spacecraft, which would have been the second stage of a four stage space vehicle intended to service the Manned Orbiting Laboratory. It would have used a two stage engine similar in principle to the later Gemini and Apollo orbital rockets.\n\nThe Manned Orbital Telescope (MOT) was discussed by General Electric and the American Rocket Society in May 1955. A proposal for the Big Gemini was submitted to the Smithsonian Institution in January 1956, and approved by the Committee on National Space Policy in 1965. General Electric considered producing only one type of launch vehicle, but later decided to support both the manned and unmanned Big Gemini vehicles.\n\nDesign\n\nThe four stage Big Gemini was to be launched on a Jupiter-3 rocket, which would serve as a launch platform much like that of the Jupiter-2 used in the Gemini Program. The reentry module was to have separated from the rest of the launch vehicle after about 100 miles, and would have then used solar power for the long journey back through the Earth or Sun's atmosphere to have landed back on Earth at some point in the Pacific Ocean. The launch vehicle would have remained in orbit for some months.\n\nOnce in orbit, the Big Gemini would have employed a similar type of maneuvering system used in the later Gemini and Apollo space vehicles to enable it to perform precise science and reconnaissance missions within the atmosphere of the Earth. This maneuvering system was also used on the manned version of the Apollo Lunar Module. The Gemini was to have been the largest manned spacecraft ever constructed. General Electric estimated the man-rated cost of the Big Gemini to be over $3 billion.\n\nHistory\n\nGeneral Electric first envisioned the manned Big Gemini in 1955 following the decision to cancel the Big Bird project. When it was announced the project was put on hold. General Electric stated that the project was based upon the need for a manned Big Bird project to explore space. However, the project was abandoned due to funding and technical problems. It is suggested that the space race was a major factor in the cancellation of this program.\n\nA similar manned Big Bird project was later proposed by the American Rocket Society in 1956. The Big Bird used the Jupiter 1.1, the same rocket which was used on Project Mercury. However, the American Rocket Society was soon turned down, because of the similarity between the Big Bird\/MOT and the proposed manned version of the Gemini, which was in a similar program. The American Rocket Society's proposal was based on a similar program which was put on hold and canceled in 1957 which the United States Marine Corps wished to use for Project Constellation. The American Rocket Society's proposal was approved and a similar manned Big Bird project began under Project Constellation. Project Constellation was the manned version of the Gemini project.\n\nGeneral Electric later proposed a similar man-rated version of a manned Big Bird and it was submitted to NASA in 1965 but it was not funded. NASA stated that it planned to fund the development of the manned version of the Big Gemini and launch a manned mission before 1972. This plan is not listed as a planned Gemini project in any NASA documents or as a \"Gemini\" in any documents by General Electric. This program was also not supported by Richard Nixon's New American Program or Richard Nixon's Space Exploration Initiative.\n\nSee also\n\n Big Gemini\n Big Bird\n Jupiter 1.1\n Project

{"id":2932,"ended":true,"length":610,"text":"Genes with a most recent common ancestor, and thus a shared evolutionary ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they represent one copy of the gene duplicated from another, or a separate gene duplicated by the species itself.\n\nGene duplication is a common way for genes to originate, with many duplicates existing through genetic drift (a random evolutionary process). Because the duplicates contain the same genome sequence, the genes can evolve to have different functions, and, in some cases, can become heterologous, or heteroplasmy. In some instances, one gene can gain functions from two separate copies, or gain functions due to the combination of two heteroplasmy genes.\n\nFor instance, the gene coding for bile duct endothelial cells, one of the key components of bile duct function, is duplicated a few times within choroid plexus epithelial cells, which is a type of cell within the choroid plexus. The resulting heteroplasmy gene has also given rise to other heteroplasmy genes, giving rise to a complete gene family (see below ).\n\nThis gene family is responsible for the regulation of bile duct development. Bile ducts are found in gall bladder, biliary tract, and in the brain, and they are responsible for the transport of bile from the liver into the duodenum.\n\nThe bile duct endothelial cells are of particular importance, because they are the cells that line the ducts. They serve as the only barrier between the bile and the surrounding tissue, and a defective bile duct or the ability to express a defective endothelial cell surface protein is known to predispose to cholangiocarcinoma, a form of liver cancer.\n\nGene families\n\nBile duct endothelial cell homologs are involved in the regulation of bile duct development, particularly the expression of the endothelial cell surface proteins, which play a key role in the development of the bile duct. One of these is endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, whose genetic variants are present in 15% of all bile duct cancers, and is associated with a poor prognosis.\n\nThe endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 homolog, which has been termed VEGFR5, acts as a receptor for VEGF, a potent vasculogenic growth factor involved in the development of cholangiocarcinoma. This may indicate that VEGFR5 plays a key role in the bile duct carcinogenesis process.\n\nTwo other genes, VEGFR1 and SDC, have also been noted to play a role in bile duct development. VEGFR1 is a member of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) family, a set of growth factors that promote cell proliferation and angiogenesis. SDC, a member of the secreted demulcent protein gene family, is an essential bile duct cell surface protein implicated in the formation of the B-cell junction.\n\nThe current results reveal the previously unknown role for the endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 and SDC genes which are members of the VEGFR5 gene family. The VEGFR5 gene family is composed of 5 genes, VEGFR1 \u2013 VEGFR5, and SDC, as well as the VEGFR1 and SDC genes. However, it is still unclear the roles of VEGFR5 proteins on bile duct development and whether they will play an important role in the occurrence of bile duct tumors. Future studies will shed more light on these functions of the genes.","token_len":762,"entropy":[6.3923,6.1247,2.9189,8.92,4.0586,8.1733,2.1664,2.3316,3.3895,4.202,2.959,6.7651,4.8211,4.9207,1.7799,2.2375,3.8209,1.7272,3.473,3.0495,1.0376,0.7989,2.8573,4.664,4.8947,6.5662,4.9199,5.1487,1.565,4.1239,3.3084,2.9435,3.5202,1.1928,1.2458,4.9105,1.7094,6.0475,3.9979,4.1602,0.1966,1.4301,2.524,6.9745,0.1141,2.268,1.4165,1.1748,0.0288,5.2456,5.1637,2.7892,1.962,0.0066,2.8865,2.6939,5.1488,3.7716,0.3478,1.5587,0.0003,5.8189,0.2979,1.2709,1.803,1.7717,3.3042,2.3825,2.6458,0.1783,6.5161,2.2807,3.8535,2.865,5.2766,1.6329,7.1414,5.4359,4.3629,2.1375,3.3182,3.4598,7.3489,6.7892,0.2626,1.7214,4.6134,2.4078,4.8535,1.035,6.4074,2.4177,0.2434,3.5265,1.304,0.4848,2.0636,3.3986,2.4978,4.4827,2.8423,4.4895,1.76,3.5114,1.6708,1.9493,4.8488,1.7755,1.1734,0.1563,0.013,4.0732,3.9377,7.3263,0.4249,0.564,2.4646,3.0242,3.9605,2.9373,1.2171,2.2589,1.0775,2.7175,2.4361,3.0059,0.0467,4.9287,1.6494,1.4225,6.9099,5.4197,1.4618,4.658,5.8186,1.3375,1.818,2.3687,6.2468,0.9431,7.5912,0.0057,2.8001,5.055,0.0273,1.3732,5.9961,0.4593,0.0935,0.2587,1.3,0.3602,0.9305,0.0002,3.6528,2.8926,0.0099,2.2596,2.9332,4.96,0.119,5.3664,3.1305,0.6263,7.2072,0.1631,1.2943,2.7961,4.9389,0.1829,0.2201,4.7416,2.5005,0.0562,4.8458,0.0863,0.009,3.3916,0.1169,1.4859,3.6557,0.0024,6.918,1.9556,0.6008,3.4812,9.2819,2.0724,1.6926,4.3261,0.4117,0.7823,6.6566,1.582,0.0494,1.5751,2.2124,2.5043,2.1145,3.0238,0.0218,3.0086,5.6614,0.4713,3.1994,0.0329,0.0451,1.3928,0.0008,0.0155,1.0555,1.5752,3.5097,4.788,0.1368,0.1837,0.1355,1.1426,3.5536,5.1331,6.8307,0.033,0.0056,3.2933,5.2256,0.224,0.0249,0.033,0.3035,0.7704,7.6114,0.0809,0.0133,2.587,6.1071,3.144,3.3087,3.0736,2.3385,2.7687,6.0772,0.628,0.0001,4.1307,3.4844,2.6793,1.2347,5.047,0.0064,1.5515,4.0157,0.0209,3.8313,0.1594,0.0289,5.2262,1.5319,3.5435,0.0754,0.0058,2.682,1.2554,4.8089,0.638,10.3695,3.3504,1.4359,4.8346,2.3479,2.7881,0.1989,1.4026,5.1316,1.5573,4.3998,1.0943,1.1602,2.5295,1.2204,2.772,0.008,1.3776,6.0222,0.2229,3.1801,0.004,2.5686,0.8068,4.0796,3.2674,0.1452,8.5312,0.0078,0.027,1.2299,1.9979,0.0002,1.9946,3.4066,0.0949,0.0075,6.0673,0.3209,0.3958,1.5807,6.161,2.3045,0.7344,2.8384,0.5312,0.4849,1.4335,1.5139,4.0274,0.8008,6.153,0.2435,4.2186,1.7725,2.0776,2.1224,4.7302,0.3744,1.2601,5.339,4.7489,0.7151,0.58,2.7709,0.0097,6.5995,0.562,3.5485,1.4745,0.8982,0.7594,5.3011,8.9624,1.38,0.0051,0.1611,5.7506,4.0423,5.1164,0.3332,5.9122,2.2054,3.838,5.4363,0.2488,0.107,6.9841,3.8478,3.0921,3.2465,1.0176,4.2656,0.0053,0.8437,6.4244,2.7799,0.6939,0.866,2.6447,0.0158,0.0005,0.146,1.4678,0.9398,2.5315,0.0105,3.1179,0.521,0.4688,0.7735,0.0002,6.4189,6.5581,1.1274,0.0002,4.5592,0.1622,0.0543,1.8937,0.0366,2.687,5.2789,0.0785,0.0991,1.0139,6.6265,0.058,1.3952,1.0622,0.0119,1.7625,0.053,0.1412,0.5415,1.2988,4.7377,2.2208,3.9722,0.056,1.7366,2.8286,0.1621,0.976,1.5761,2.2615,2.2715,1.6222,3.9444,0.6359,1.7269,0.0222,0.0241,0.947,1.6074,0.0611,1.2528,1.7622,0.014,0.0805,0.3422,5.2526,0.9648,1.7526,2.3124,3.7368,0.0747,0.8717,3.2886,0.0287,0.6771,2.1564,1.8786,5.5118,6.899,4.7515,1.1896,3.6914,0.2156,6.8256,0.9299,0.2502,2.067,2.9167,0.0201,0.0069,5.8436,1.7679,0.9014,2.5745,3.3347,0.0359,1.8299,6.1985,1.7045,0.0014,1.482,0.8959,0.0002,1.9081,3.3053,0.0927,0.1465,0.4176,0.017,0.0714,0.3249,5.0668,0.0268,3.2458,2.2832,2.7078,0.847,6.4857,6.4014,1.5303,1.7001,6.6063,0.6175,4.8529,0.7353,0.32,4.4714,0.7193,2.9313,0.0041,1.8203,2.7499,0.9273,5.7331,3.8138,4.1403,2.4461,5.9497,0.1439,5.1098,0.0201,1.0177,1.9307,0.0571,3.2116,0.0674,0.0002,0.0206,0.0197,0.0028,0.0029,0.0247,0.5579,3.0925,5.2932,5.0138,0.4912,1.8816,0.0005,0.1573,0.086,3.2375,0.3673,1.9038,0.0172,0.0357,0.5728,5.4402,0.0174,0.0161,8.3765,0.0186,2.5002,0.6457,0.6466,0.0002,5.7773,1.5961,2.1601,1.0669,1.5709,0.0291,0.3683,1.8867,0.16,6.6774,6.9275,2.8325,2.5951,2.2831,0.0377,5.7377,0.4417,0.9177,0.4468,0.3489,0.0497,2.96,0.0056,0.0086,0.7645,0.6391,1.5101,0.002,0.0392,0.0547,0.8928,1.9409,4.0687,0.0076,0.3865,2.5913,6.8664,3.6472,0.1195,0.026,2.3194,0.0654,5.5487,0.0151,2.5849,1.9047,3.8172,0.0674,1.8113,0.4522,0.5986,3.4792,5.6967,0.014,7.2198,0.4509,0.6911,3.5972,2.9572,1.1671,0.9021,6.4516,0.0325,0.0124,0.7448,1.2166,0.0047,1.4078,1.911,2.4434,0.0014,0.1831,9.6418,2.0528,11.1255,8.5645,4.949,2.1562,3.5573,0.3841,0.2264,0.703,3.3651,3.7352,6.9434,0.1229,0.0541,3.9732,3.5996,0.0752,6.1251,0.0264,0.8154,3.5772,0.0887,2.0508,5.2984,2.2158,0.4832,8.2829,1.019,0.4592,0.0002,1.8484,7.307,5.1852,5.493,2.9767,8.6351,1.2646,0.6989,3.5401,2.2471,1.3249,0.1096,0.0758,0.5005,0.0053,0.041,0.6671,3.3282,2.8221,0.0156,4.5209,8.1947,1.3112,6.9855,0.0063,0.3385,0.7014,1.6576,0.0735,4.0371,1.6923,0.0418,0.454,2.0189,2.0089,0.0101,0.0596,0.8306,0.6136,0.2682,1.1424,3.6947,0.0702,4.4953,2.8936,1.0032,3.3461,0.0354,0.1404,0.5435,8.4569,0.82,0.0249,0.1779,2.1333,1.9081,1.6399,1.1718,0.0472,1.8023,4.1329,0.3782,0.0027,2.2455,1.4269,0.1158,0.1111,1.1089,1.733,0.3926,0.0105,1.0511,0.8213,5.3911,0.0082,3.4092,0.55,3.8714,0.9576,5.9345,3.3466,0.3086,2.322,0.

Kepler-7, the primary focus of the Kepler data, is about 6,700 light-years (2,300 parsecs) from Earth. At the time of this image, the star appears as a yellowish star to the unaided eye. A parsec (3.26 light-years) is a measure of distance and is equivalent to about 6.4 trillion miles (10 trillion km). Credit: NASA's Ames Research Center \/ William Kurz\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- In an effort to find new worlds to inhabit, NASA's Kepler telescope is turning out a plethora of discoveries about exoplanets, the small bodies that orbit stars other than the Sun.\n\nNASA's Ames Research Center is working with scientists in Belgium to analyze and use that data in what is called the \"Kepler Mission\". Scientists have found that approximately three times the number of small exoplanets have been discovered orbiting stars other than the Sun than have been discovered orbiting the Sun. To date, more than 1,100 planets have been discovered. Of these, more than 400 are in the habitable zone of their parent stars.\n\nAt the time of this image, the star appears as a yellowish star to the unaided eye. A parsec (3.26 light-years) is a measure of distance equivalent to about 6.4 trillion miles (11 trillion km), and is a measure of the average distance from the Earth to the Sun. The colors were determined from the light of the star. Credit: NASA \/ D. Laughlin\n\nAlthough this star is so far away from us, the scientists found that it has what is called a hot supergiant like the Sun. However, the star has cooler corona than the Sun. At this point, it is thought that planets are less dense than hydrogen and so do not cool so quickly as the Sun\u2019s outer corona. In addition, they found that Kepler 7 has less oxygen. This indicates that planets may be less dense than hydrogen as well so it would be more efficient for them to have oxygen in their atmospheres. This may explain low amounts of oxygen on planets at this level in Kepler 7\u2019s spectral class. In addition, Kepler 7 has low energy of emission due to very strong gravity compared in a smaller body. The scientists were able to compare Kepler 7 to Earth, Venus, Jupiter and Neptune to help determine how thick the planet\u2019s atmosphere would have to be to support liquid water on the surface. In comparison, the radius of the planet is comparable to Jupiter's and Neptune\u2019s radius.\n\nTo measure the density of planets more accurately than they can through the telescope, the scientists developed a new method and applied it to the Kepler data. By looking for how quickly an exoplanet\u2019s orbit varies as it passes the star compared to that of the star, they were able to make better estimates for the planets\u2019 density. This new methodology is called the Doppler approach. \"We are starting to use this method and it may lead to more accurate, better data for planetary density\" said Dr. Dan Lubin from the Ames

{"id":4347,"ended":true,"length":668,"text":"The Recruits Training Depot and a detachment of the RAF Depot from RAF Halton arrived in August 1919, merging to form No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge. The station itself was designated as depot A on the British Army's wartime Order of Battle, and was one of the smaller Air Depots. It housed the Army Air Corps (AAOC) School of Navigation, which was established in February 1920. A detachment of the AAOC (Cobras) was based there from July 1921 to 1 July 1923, and the station was also the home base of No. 73 Section, RAF Flying Training School and No. 90 Wing, RAF Air Cadet Organisation (former No. 22 Group ) from 1923 to 1927. The station was the home of No. 6 Air Repair and Service School from 1923 to 1927 as well as No. 24 Wing, RAF Air Cadet Organisation (former No. 33 Wing ) from 1927 to 1931.\n\nOn 1 October 1931 the Depot was transferred from army to Royal Air Force control and became No. 4 Air Depot. The school continued to operate from the depot until 1941. It was given a number of new units from RAF Cranwell during the first half of 1939, some of which became detached to RAF Wittering the following month. One squadron remained at the depot until September 1941. The Depot was then re-designated No. 1 (Maintenance) School, RAF Uxbridge, on 25 October 1941. From 7 June 1942 until 15 July 1945 the Depot was briefly known as No. 1 Maintenance School, RAF Uxbridge.\n\nRAF Uxbridge served as the primary home of both No. 1 and No. 3 (Refueling And Supply) Groups in early 1944, and the station was known as RAF Uxbridge No. 1 (Aircraft) Group from early 1944 until February 1945. Following the end of the war RAF Uxbridge was inactivated on 10 September 1945. It was redesignated 'No. 1 Maintenance Depot of RAF Maintenance Command' on 24 October 1946.\n\nDuring the 1950s the station was briefly used as a training centre for the newly formed Women's Auxiliary Service in the summer. In 1956 Air Commodore C.D.G. Ransley was appointed as the acting Commanding Officer of the Depot in succession to Air Vice-Marshal Smedley Butler. On 1 January 1957 it came back to army control, and at this time, three training units were based there : the Aviation Cadet Support Training Unit and No 1 and No 2 Maintenance Training Units. In 1974 it came back under Royal Air Force control and became No. 1 Air Refueling Depot, RAF Uxbridge. In the latter role it served as a centre for training aircrew for operations with the RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle. It was renamed RAF Uxbridge No. 1 Base on 1 September 2010 with a new base code of XGB and a single unit code of 498.\n\nThe Depot's current role is as a centre of depot management, and serves as the depot manager for a number of units based at the Bishops Stortford airfield. The Depot employs approximately 500 civilians and 350 personnel are directly employed by the Depot and the two Training Units which are also based there.\n\nThe depot is one of the largest facilities being used to store and process Royal Air Force aircraft parts.

{"id":572,"ended":true,"length":686,"text":"Harold Adams Innis was born in 1894 on a small livestock and dairy farm near the community of Otterville in southwestern Ontario's Oxford County. As a boy he loved the rhythms and routines of the countryside, the endless days of summer. As he grew older he developed an interest in the natural world and dreamed, while working as a country veterinarian, of joining the British Navy.\n\nIn 1910 at the age of 18 he was appointed to the Royal Naval College, Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, where he was among the very first set of cadets selected by the British government to attend.\n\nHis early training was both military and naturalist oriented. Soon after his arrival in 1911, the college built a small zoo that had as its centrepiece the magnificent Bengal tiger who was to become not only Adams' pet but one of his lifelong passions.\n\n'I got to really know a tiger very much,' he later said of his time at the institution. 'A tiger is very much like a dog, only a little bigger and very much more active. They need to be exercised and they need feeding, with a little bit of love.'\n\nHe loved his zoo, but after graduation Adams found his calling and he applied the principles he'd learned about animal husbandry and management to the challenge of saving the colony of Great White Sharks which had plagued his home waters for decades.\n\nThe first Great White Shark Sightings at South Carolina's Edisto Beach In February 1919 members of the South Carolina legislature set out from Charleston to Edisto Beach to study the cause of the Great White Sharks that had begun to devour the local fishing fleet and damage the beach resorts. The shark research team included Dr. William H. Poteat and his son Bill.\n\nThe shark project attracted the interest of Harold Adams and, following a period of preliminary research, the future conservationists went to Edisto Beach to set up a marine observation station'the first of its kind of its time. Not only had there never been a marine observatory on a beach, but the first ever to use aerial photographs to document and study the local marine life in its entirety.\n\nThe great white shark became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the 1920s '30s and '40s, spawning an international conservation and media campaign which came to an end when Adams' long term conservation efforts with the sharks were abandoned and the animals were hunted into near extinction.\n\nAdams was an animal conservationist and he dedicated his life to that cause. He was a member of The World Conservation Union and the American Association of Naturopaths.\n\nIn 1932 he married Dolly Mary Sillman. For years they lived in the house of Dolly's family at Old Otterville before moving to Oxford County, Ontario.\n\nIn 1937 the Canadian government appointed him to the Marine Biological Station at Cape Crozier. For 30 years he worked diligently to protect marine life and he helped put together the original scientific data that would form the basis for the North Atlantic Fishery Commission's management of the region's marine life.\n\nIn 1940 Adams left active scientific marine work to return to school and study dentistry.

{"id":3256,"ended":true,"length":687,"text":"The sister ships then rejoined the Kido Butai at Staring Bay on Celebes Island in preparation for the Indian Ocean raid. By this time the air groups had been reorganized to consist of 21 Zeros flown by Lt. Mitsuda, 23 Zeros flown by Lt. Tange, and 23 Zeros flown by Lt. Kamei. The first strike by the 21 Zeroes took place between 0225 and 0230 on 5 December 1942. These strikes were primarily aimed not against the Japanese coastal batteries but at the enemy shore establishment at Malino on Java. During these strikes the Zeros suffered a number and types of losses. The losses were due to strafing by two Nakajima Ki-43 torpedo-bombers from the Imperial Japanese Navy fighter group and a single B-25 Mitchell. The loss to Japanese fighters was estimated at one aircraft, although others claim a total of 3 Zeroes lost. The losses to the B-25 Mitchell were also quite heavy at 4\u20137 aircraft (although that is in dispute), although both strafing attacks were claimed as hits. The losses during the first strike were estimated at 5 aircraft with possibly a further aircraft lost during or following the second strike. Both strikes were to be the only air attacks on Java the Kido Butai conducted.\n\nLt. Tange was the leader of the Japanese air forces in the attack on Java. When their ships were returning to Celebes at around 0230 the air forces had been reinforced with 15 more Zeros, now totaling 27 of the 21 air groups. All 21 Zeros flew east to cover the return of the remaining Kido Butai ships. As they were arriving back at Batavia Tange ordered the 14 remaining Zeros in the southernmost air group to fly to the north and attack British forces off Java. All aircraft had been damaged at some point during their attacks on Java so this left Lt. Masuda as leader of the southernmost air group. He and eight other Zeros were ordered to fly west to attack Batavia, which was then harbouring four ships of the British Combined Operations Task Force. At around 0275 the 14 Zeros were ordered to attack the southward-moving British cruisers,, and.\n\nThe Japanese aircraft flew to the north through the dense clouds. However, while in the process of diving, they were spotted by the four British cruisers. One of the cruisers,, turned towards the Japanese aircraft, and a short firefight ensued. The four British cruisers turned to their guns after firing a number of rounds from their secondary battery and managed to cause some damage. However, by this time the remaining 11 Zeros in the air group were no longer able to continue the attack and turned back to Celebes.\n\nBy this time the return air group had received a radio message saying \"All aircraft returned by now. No further operations till 6 December \". Two of the Japanese air groups were destroyed. Those remaining had now become the northernmost air group of the Kido Butai and were flying to the north but were unable to find any British ships. They were also informed that the Japanese air raid on Java had been a total failure, as the ships were still in port and were no longer a threat.\n\nA total of 14 aircraft flew from Batavia to attack Java on 5 December 1942. Five were shot down, and seven were damaged, including both the Japanese aircraft leader, and a number of others whose fuel tanks were damaged rendering them unable to land or take off.

{"id":1343,"ended":true,"length":683,"text":"Like almost all cats, the cougar is a solitary animal. Only mothers and kittens live in groups, with adults meeting only to mate. It is secretive and crepuscular, being most active between dusk and dawn. It is rarely seen, except during breeding season.\n\nRelated species :\n\nCougar is a member of the felid family, with the largest members of the cat family being the jaguar and African wild cat. The cougar ranges across South and Central American countries, from Mexico to Argentina, and Paraguay, and is found in the Andes, up to altitudes of 5,300 metres (17,150 feet ). It is an uncommon vagrant in Europe and the United States but is rarely seen there. Its preferred habitats are rocky mountainous country as well as forested and brushy areas ; it is rare on farms or pastures. Its prey base includes ungulates and rodents.\n\nCougars use various methods of prey capture, the most common is stealthy stalking. They use their natural camouflage and a wide range of silent sounds such as hisses, growls, hissings, and purrs or purrs only when provoked.\n\nThis prey choice is mainly due to their extremely low bodyweight. There is a myth that the cat is larger than it really is, and as a result of this, it is considered an apex predator in the wild where it is the largest cat. Cougars weigh on average 2.4 - 3.3 kg (5.5 - 6.7 lb) of prey per kill, which is far less than the weight of most prey species, even in large cats such as the jaguar.\n\nCougars are most active between dusk and dawn, and in winter may seek more protected areas such as burrows and caves.\n\nCougars hunt by being the pursuer, as well as the attacker. They stalk prey, and leap upon it, with their upper thigh acting like a trampoline. Sometimes it will also leap onto a victim, before landing and biting it in any part of the body, as well as clawing it in the neck. In South America, it is also known to use rocks, trees, or other cover to ambush prey. However, while in the United States, it usually does not attack until cornered or when its prey is least able to escape. The predator has excellent balance and can run at speeds of up to 50 kph (31 mph), making it almost impossible for an unguided chase in a forest. The cougar's strong hind legs allow it to sprint faster than most animals for such a large animal, making it an excellent hunting animal.\n\nFemale cougars spend the first year of their life in bachelor groups. They are solitary. The first two weeks, they hide and stay close to their mothers, while in the next few weeks they will leave the group. The last stage in this phase of life is when the kitten hunts on its own.\n\nRelated articles\n\nCougars are solitary, secretive, solitary and have a unique reproductive behaviour that is found only in many species of cats including the mountain lion.

{"id":687,"ended":true,"length":635,"text":"Prior to 1895 two 6 @ - @ inch ( 200 mm ) breech @ - @ loading guns had been imported for use in small boats. This use was rejected by military authorities who found that the guns were inaccurate, inefficient and very heavy. The first gun to be imported for general use @ - @ inches ( 250 mm ) was issued in 1893 by the Navy.\n\nIn spite of the advantages of being capable of higher @ - @ feet ( 590 mm ) @ - @ fire, it was found that, as the projectiles are forced through the breech into and out of the breech hole of the next gun, one can only attain high @ - @ fire only if the following conditions are met :\n\n( a ) The breech has a large diameter and is as short as possible to obviate the possibility of accidental discharge.\n\n( b ) The weapon must be provided with a locking system which prevents the weapon from accidentally being locked in the ready state.\n\nIn 1895 Colt manufactured the small arm for U. S. Marine Corps designated the Model 1897 Browning Automatic Weapon ( B. A. W. ), which was a modified Model 1893 \/94 - @ - @ inches ( 7.62 x 55 mm ) with a longer barrel. B. A. W. is a short, low pistol-grip weapon which is generally deployed in an inverted 45\u00b0 angle.\n\nIn 1896, the U. S. Marine Corp ordered 1000 M \/. 1897 B. A. W. and, in 1898, Colt also exported them to other countries. In 1904 the M \/. 1897 was manufactured at the Westinghouse Factory in the Millington, Tennessee.\n\nIn 1913 the Navy adopted the M\/. 1897, and in 1915 the M. 1897A1 ( also called M. 1897N4, M. 97N, M. 97N-4, and M. 97N7 ), which is different from the Colt M\/ 1897B3 ( see the Colt M91 Muzzle Brake ), was adopted. The Navy supplied 5,957 M. 97As1s and 5,957 M. 97B3s ( 1,500 with the fixed sights ) to the Philippine Islands and the M \/ 97s would be used in island defenses against U. S. forces during World War I ( see Colt M95 ).\n\nA M\/. 1897B5 ( M. 97N6 ) was issued to the Philippine Constabulary after World War I and, after it was determined that the M. 1897A1s and B3s should be discontinued, the Philippine Constabulary continued to use the B5s which they had acquired in 1903.\n\nIn 1925 the Philippine Constabulary placed an order with the Colt Factory in Lima, Ohio, for 5,000 M\/. 1897A4s which were designated as Model 1927. The Philippine Constabulary originally ordered an additional 7,500 M\/. 1897A4s in 1927 but withdrew this order in 1930 when the Philippine Constabulary ordered a new pistol, the.38 Revolver, which was manufactured under license by the Colt. In 1932 these new Philippine revolvers were issued to the Philippine Constabulary. The Philippine Constabulary would replace the Colt M. 1897s with Colt Automatic Pistols, or AIPs, manufactured by the Colt Factory in Lima, Ohio.\n\nThe Philippine Constabulary also placed additional orders with the Colt Factory for 500 M\/. 1897C2s which they designated as Model 1929.

{"id":3390,"ended":true,"length":688,"text":"Leno's first London appearance in pantomime was as Dame Durden in Jack and the Beanstalk, which he performed at London's Surrey Theatre in 1886, having been spotted singing `` Going to the Fair'' on the Thames between Greenwich and Lambeth. During the 1890s, he turned to writing, notably the novel One of a Crowd (1895), while still performing in pantomime.\n\nLeno was born in New Brunswick, Canada. His mother died not long after the boy was born, and he was raised by his single mother and his widowed aunt. After attending Queen's College and working as a clerk, he moved to England, and in 1881 he joined the chorus of the music hall company of Charles Noden.\n\nIn 1882 Leno made his first professional appearance in pantomime as Captain Kipper at the Surrey Theatre (near Guildford, Surrey, England). In 1883 he appeared in Jack and the Beanstalk at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, and in 1884 at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Drury Lane as the Prince of Wales. He performed in a number of pantomimes in London in the 1880s. In 1889 he played the role of King Aladdin in Aladdin at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nLeno married Ellen Nesbitt in early 1886. When their first child was six months old, they toured the United States, where he turned down offers of a London engagement because he wanted to stay with his family. He came back for only nine months. On 6 August 1889 Leno was appointed to the Chair of Modern History (then called Modern Languages and the Fine Arts) at London University. In 1892 he resumed the music hall stage, appearing in pantomimes in London and in provincial theatres. His first West End appearance was as Billy Bones, the Pirate, at the Savoy Theatre on 10 September 1893. Leno performed in pantomime in Britain and the United States for the rest of his life. He also wrote poetry.\n\nIn 1894, Leno returned to London to take up the position of Master of Balliol College. In 1900 he married for the second time, to Emily Louise Atherton, a novelist.\n\nIn 1912 he was invited by George Bernard Shaw and his wife, Constance, to deliver a series of four radio broadcasts with an American poet at their home in London, including readings by Shaw himself. In January 1933 Leno made a series of broadcasts in which he read from his collected works and from works by Shakespeare. Over the next few years Leno made many more radio broadcasts, notably with actors from the theatre. In 1942 he took part in the BBC play Night Nurse with Laurence Olivier. In 1952 he made another set of Shakespearean radio broadcasts.\n\nIn March 1953 Leno joined an all-night performance of Hamlet given by the Royal Shakespeare Company at Covent Garden. Leno's name and image appeared on publicity posters and a brochure for the performance, and he helped make publicity videos for the event. At the end of the performance, the principal actor, Peter O'Toole, invited Leno to join the company and play Lear and to give the principal soliloquy. Leno said that he would consider it.

{"id":1310,"ended":true,"length":754,"text":"Almost 70 % of the Pirates'rushing offense came from running back Chris Johnson, and the rushing offense itself consisted of two \u2013 thirds of East Carolina's total offensive effort. Six different times \u2013 on the way to their first AAC Championship in a long three years \u2013 the Pirates marched into scoring position, and six times \u2013 they fumbled away those trips out of the end zone \u2013 costing the Pirates an easy 21 to 14 win over Houston. The Pirates lost the turnover battle 2-0 to lose their first AAC Championship in three years, and are one win away from a chance to play for a National Invite \u2013 and play for a chance to go to play in a Bowl game \u2013 against Georgia Tech if they had lost.\n\nThe good news here \u2013 for East Carolina, is that as much as their defense will have to be on point in order to take down a Georgia Tech team that averages 32 points a game \u2013 they will have to do more than that to slow down an offense that averaged 39 points a game against the AAC \u2013 a league which has produced all three of the National Invite teams so far this season. The bad news \u2013 is that the Pirates are playing for only their second National Invite to ever be handed out (and if the Pirates win it would be their first against a Power Five school ). The bad news for the Pirates as well \u2013 is that they have been shut out three times in their last nine games \u2013 although this was their second shut out of the season and both of their shut outs of the season have come against West conference rivals ( Cincinnati beat the Pirates in October, and Cincinnati ). The good news for both teams is that they are a game and a half away from playing for a National Invite, and the bad news for both teams is that you will have to bet on them either \u2013 and most likely this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve heard this.\n\nThe good news about Georgia Tech, is that against the Pirates they were able to do what they normally do best \u2013 which is to throw the ball. Starting freshman quarterback Jeff Sims threw 5 touchdowns in his first college career start against Cincinnati, and Georgia Tech got another win which may be more important than any win they have had in years, as Sims took over the starting job from redshirt freshman TaQuon Marshall. Marshall took over for the injured James Graham who had been thrown into the fire with an immediate start at the start of last season, and Marshall struggled to the tune of an average of 164 yards per game and a less than impressive 13 touchdown in a lackluster campaign which will certainly continue to haunt him as he returns for his senior season next year. This season Sims has been able to post about the same yardage per game average (and more yards per game against an easier schedule), and he has completed just under two more touchdown passes than Marshall against far better competition.\n\nThe good thing about the Pirates \u2013 is that this isn\u2019t the year\u2019s version of the East Carolina defense that was so poor in 2015 but were able to get better in 2016, as they were able to bring in an entire new lineup of players \u2013 many of which are the better players in the AAC. The bad news is that they are two-thirds of the way done with what is their best season in three years, and they have only been able to stop Georgia Tech once in the last three \u2013 two years and counting.\n\nThe good news (for the Pirates) is that they are getting the better version of Georgia Tech, as the previous four teams to beat the Yellow Jackets on their home field have all been from the AAC. It will be interesting to see if it will be the next two teams in the AAC to do the same \u2013 or if East Carolina will be able to stop the Yellow Jackets from their first National Invite since 2008.","token_len":780,"entropy":[8.493,5.2781,0.1333,1.9958,12.9087,1.7017,16.9745,10.9915,3.6504,3.1658,0.5107,4.8153,2.0594,4.9182,1.6355,0.9621,2.8154,2.2495,8.5889,1.9589,7.0734,5.4503,0.4642,2.8486,9.0115,13.4301,0.2424,11.9257,1.8196,0.1462,3.5552,3.5319,5.2976,0.3658,7.7,4.9718,7.7495,4.8655,3.5236,1.8116,6.1754,0.3737,4.8574,1.2735,8.0178,2.0112,1.7682,4.09,5.0889,10.5511,0.7937,0.4425,0.7979,1.3113,7.4336,2.4427,9.1678,0.7103,1.6746,1.9008,6.9849,1.1535,1.3096,2.5425,7.1578,0.4705,6.7366,6.6573,7.3705,6.0018,0.1821,1.1533,4.2239,0.1435,4.344,8.4196,1.1959,3.1521,2.9336,2.9469,5.296,6.5647,2.9277,2.9811,2.9045,4.8202,0.552,2.5456,1.9563,4.5023,2.5206,6.4895,0.4985,6.7866,0.193,1.039,2.2713,7.9196,2.9172,1.7253,3.715,1.0361,1.2083,2.1497,0.1734,1.1085,0.5874,4.7365,4.7962,2.3542,0.7922,0.0253,2.5776,6.7102,0.5383,3.4924,2.1769,1.532,3.059,8.758,3.0829,6.7175,2.0452,5.7438,1.1516,1.0191,4.4849,0.2564,4.4056,1.1162,7.1588,1.4233,2.3899,7.0831,3.4267,2.6902,3.0653,6.1217,0.6917,5.7099,0.5247,6.9112,5.079,1.6605,0.7477,0.002,2.0402,5.8292,0.0983,4.2899,4.2281,3.7221,7.6875,0.0081,1.353,5.0865,0.2432,5.5259,3.1029,0.3718,4.157,2.186,3.6537,2.8994,1.1804,3.0268,4.4194,3.8159,2.5401,1.2581,0.1995,4.0749,1.9539,2.2419,3.3959,0.0099,0.5517,0.7118,5.7491,5.7112,1.167,1.6076,0.0228,2.0738,1.3407,1.6236,0.97,0.6284,2.9676,3.5461,0.3566,1.6767,2.1631,6.4806,0.9155,3.0075,2.0758,0.2293,4.0463,4.889,0.3591,0.6356,0.0221,4.4159,1.8326,7.1384,5.645,3.6845,5.2811,5.0091,1.9023,4.2943,5.9631,2.3458,0.7207,0.7659,5.934,0.2323,1.3582,1.2654,4.9215,0.032,0.57,0.5141,0.6479,2.3436,0.8071,0.0083,2.7559,2.8664,0.0956,1.8131,2.9746,2.2552,4.071,3.3462,4.5895,2.5399,0.703,2.4834,0.0822,0.0146,4.7126,4.0294,2.5743,5.2545,1.5279,4.2593,2.8898,4.6937,2.6744,2.3394,2.7691,2.7971,2.3952,0.8345,1.6265,0.9441,5.5811,0.9104,4.395,1.7849,2.3121,7.6393,2.3969,2.7332,0.0085,2.6523,0.6136,1.0993,5.6652,3.2209,1.4894,0.3952,0.0803,1.5323,1.9213,2.8245,5.3462,0.309,4.1727,0.419,1.2294,1.6821,0.7536,3.3891,1.0472,1.6869,7.0008,2.7778,2.4993,2.3379,2.4418,2.3167,1.7019,1.7833,0.3428,1.045,2.6141,6.9868,2.1866,1.936,2.8078,1.9885,3.1469,0.4133,1.0123,3.422,0.9792,0.8678,5.1844,12.896,4.3564,2.6992,7.6951,7.8844,2.6819,2.7459,1.7341,4.7374,1.5995,2.0344,3.6983,14.3641,1.8391,1.3171,0.0159,0.8353,4.4688,1.2972,1.077,0.0507,1.6267,1.4383,4.4044,4.6059,4.9497,0.4649,1.3612,1.3571,0.0079,3.2891,0.6344,0.5127,0.3478,0.0989,0.0074,2.3007,0.6696,2.7612,2.1781,0.008,0.7158,2.3849,0.5348,0.112,0.0455,6.0623,2.7992,1.0144,0.2634,6.4278,1.5414,1.3687,5.614,7.3846,2.5545,4.7436,0.4822,5.8632,4.922,16.3062,6.7927,3.2956,1.3501,2.8563,0.2405,3.1495,11.6819,0.6162,3.4334,2.5865,3.3622,2.2156,0.5034,0.0004,2.338,3.6754,0.0434,4.3923,5.0562,0.0106,2.8249,1.3571,0.0536,7.8164,1.6087,3.4445,1.9375,3.1771,1.4026,0.005,4.5274,3.0757,0.7945,4.0015,0.5037,2.9617,1.6329,6.4008,0.1189,1.9381,5.2334,1.7155,0.3248,4.0831,7.9403,4.9119,2.4018,5.8826,6.2921,3.2623,6.3439,2.8195,2.0592,1.7983,0.7796,6.7056,5.0968,2.175,1.5226,5.4143,0.8155,0.7682,5.3475,0.0038,4.6055,4.4475,4.671,7.1229,5.5352,2.2683,3.5132,1.7247,0.7284,2.264,3.301,1.9835,1.8432,1.7487,1.2367,4.5458,2.7165,2.1767,3.1515,4.8436,1.2231,1.7329,0.6308,0.5406,3.0923,7.0309,0.0048,0.3685,7.5246,4.8089,1.6727,3.9202,1.2701,5.7426,3.8242,0.2596,1.8951,2.9317,2.2991,6.3278,6.9199,4.3393,2.1955,1.8707,5.7772,2.3578,0.5352,5.899,3.3822,3.0945,7.5269,3.9268,3.5305,2.8721,2.9701,0.0241,3.8855,0.4122,1.0603,0.4922,5.403,5.8331,1.1073,5.8563,2.435,0.0035,4.6902,2.024,0.2768,8.865,0.7687,1.8677,0.1623,2.8611,2.018,7.9858,0.0937,3.1831,4.849,4.0844,6.8825,3.4143,6.2863,4.933,3.9524,6.0256,4.5796,3.9404,1.6456,3.1318,1.7875,2.2665,0.7931,3.2839,3.4257,0.5322,0.7597,0.546,3.8808,0.7885,0.1218,3.9846,3.0566,4.5951,1.7504,2.4128,2.2754,0.0058,7.0078,7.249,4.6692,0.9954,4.748,0.0234,3.1099,0.503,2.4856,3.8797,5.4875,3.6796,3.6854,0.2605,1.7202,5.9145,4.2477,7.9378,1.7432,2.6576,1.3597,2.1794,1.0138,4.7274,2.8255,5.3153,4.465,4.7509,3.749,0.0356,1.0107,2.246,6.1145,7.6489,1.8638,1.2693,0.7512,1.514,0.0002,1.6372,1.9909,5.11,0.4815,1.6036,2.1504,3.2177,1.6531,0.0652,3.8232,3.7822,1.7979,0.112,0.0038,1.4928,5.2175,12.6467,0.0674,0.4692,7.3186,0.0086,1.4543,7.2332,0.3962,3.9622,1.7553,2.5583,4.2258,5.2914,2.3534,2.5575,5.576,5.3302,1.1299,0.0054,3.0907,2.293,1.9063,0.2977,2.3123,2.5831,1.7207,2.468,0.3003,0.0076,5.1406,1.4367,3.8956,4.626,1.4038,6.5884,1.1727,2.8645,3.2664,5.9431,0.1326,1.4689,1.9394,5.0689,6.0571,1.568,0.8192,0.418,3.4712,1.182,1.4422,0.5446,0.0811,1.1457,0.0997,2.3753,1.4933,6.7174,4.6385,1.9969,0.258,0.2166,0.0085,4.9593,2.307,5.5731,2.2175,5.4608,2.7402,2.9091,1.9077,3.5018,0.1343,1.0394,0.4391,2.2098,1.7652,2.9903,2.2375,0.8565,0.0019,5.1997,3.3612,0.0034,3.6349,1.6238,1.4197,0.2545,1.558,5.2551,4.4064,3.1118,3.4783,4.268,0.5051,1.2799,0.0002,1.7824,1.8345,0.0416,6.3723,3.6486,0.9135,0.6791,0.7483,0.2075,0.0282,1.3257,1.2863,4.1386,3.1279,3.7776,7.7739,0.0131,4.2862,0.0015,1.7217,2.237,1.9523,6.4584,3.1186,1.

{"id":2833,"ended":true,"length":670,"text":"As one of the largest open spaces close to Manchester, the moor has a history of use for army manoeuvres and large public gatherings. In his book The Condition of the Working Class in England [1892] Matthew Arnold described it as \u2018 a vast wilderness \u2019, the \u2018 grandest, most magnificent, and most terrible of the English summer hills \u2019 and an \u2018unforgettable image of rural beauty.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century many local businesses had begun to occupy the moor, mainly as summer residences, and the area became less wild and more industrialised. At this time, however, it was still popular for leisure activities as well as more serious pursuits like military exercises. People built cottages or had camping equipment on the moor for longer periods. With the growth of leisure tourism the moors were gradually transformed and its public space was transformed. Most of the military camps and outbuildings have since disappeared, but there are many ruins on the moor that survive in varying states of decay.\n\nIn the seventeenth century the area was also associated with the Whig movement, with the great Whig orator Sir William Temple frequently staying at Pendlebury Hall, in the parish of Hooton, which still stands.\n\nOn one of his journeys out, he went to Pendlebury in February 1690. As an ardent Whig he would have enjoyed the beauty of the landscape at this time of year. It was cold, with temperatures averaging \u22128 \u00b0C. There was much snow but also many of the hedges and trees were in flower. The moorland was carpeted with yellow gillyflowers and the green valleys were clothed in a colourful variety of purple forget-me-nots.\n\nTemple left on horseback on 22 February and travelled towards Manchester following the Manchester Ship Canal. His journey took a leisurely twelve days and he passed through several villages. He must have seen the great expanse of moorland which his contemporaries had associated with the supernatural. He noted that along the banks of the river Irwell, there were many heathland flowers and that the sky remained cloudy. In general he described the scenery as \u2018unrivalled\u2019, but the weather was bad. However, he added that it was \u2018inclined to be fine\u2019 when he made it to Manchester. It is tempting to think that the weather conditions, including the lack of sun, made Temple\u2019s description more vivid after he came back to London.\n\nThe moor can be seen as an extension of the industrial area that surrounded Manchester.\n\nThe moor is part of the Salford Quays and is bounded by the Irwell, Pendlebury Common close to the railway line, the River Weaver and the railway line by Pendlebury Hall. Its northern edge is reached by a narrow strip of land called the Pendlebury Marshes. The moorland is in Pendlebury parish and falls within the Salford City Council Area. Salford\u2019s development has made the area an attractive destination for the growing number of holidaymakers. In recent years, Pendlebury has become a very popular location for weddings.\n\nIn this collection there are five photos taken by a family named Williams. One is of Pendlebury Moor with the city of Manchester in the distance. Another photo is of a group of people on Pendlebury Moor with their backs to the camera. A third photo is the same group with the setting sun behind them. One of the photographs shows two people who appear to be wearing traditional woolen clothes.

{"id":935,"ended":false,"length":716,"text":"A number of scientific organizations headed by the European Southern Observatory ( ESO ) organized a network of amateur astronomers and students to measure Earth's distance from the Sun during the transit. The data have been processed into a new map of the Earth's gravity field -- an inter-temporal map that, together with other gravity maps from previous events, will be used to study the interaction between the Moon and Earth.\n\nDuring an annual event called the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Transit ( SOHO T ), the Sun's disk blocked a very small portion of the Sun's light and could be seen moving through the telescope's field of view as two tiny dark spots. Astronomers refer to this event as a transit. This particular transit also marked the first measurement of the Earth's distance to the Sun, making it one of the key measurements leading to a better understanding of space weather.\n\nAn analysis of the image captured by the SOHO spacecraft on the 2 January 2004 showed that the Earth had moved back a little further from the Sun, meaning that the total length of the Earth's day had decreased slightly. Using the distance, or radius of the Sun - Earth system and the Earth's distance from the Sun, scientists were able to calculate the size of Earth's atmosphere. They were also able to determine where in the atmosphere the atmosphere had been compressed.\n\nAt the time, ESO researchers were working to determine the Sun's distance and therefore its luminosity -- a standard unit of energy. The distance measurement also measured the size of the bulge that the Sun was making on the solar disk. When combined, these two quantities allowed the researchers to calculate the approximate energy output from the Sun by the way of its energy output.\n\nThis data was also used to calculate the shape and composition of the solar wind -- the streams of electrically charged particles generated by the Sun and which are constantly propelled outward. These measurements, combined with data from the Hubble Space Telescope, can be used to calculate the dynamics of the solar wind.\n\nTo be more precise in measuring the actual distance to the Sun, ESO scientists performed further observations using the SOHO spacecraft over the course of several months during the transit to better understand the behavior of the atmosphere. The data gathered by ESO's observers and students during the event was used to create a map of the Earth's gravity field.\n\nFor this first, inter-temporal map, ESO scientists developed an automated inter-temporal gravity field model, using ground-based and spacecraft observations together with computer software to provide detailed gravimetric information. With this information, researchers have been able to establish the shape of the Earth's crust, the density of the atmosphere, the surface gravity, the variation of the crust, the variations in the density of the atmosphere, and the shape and composition of the auroraxes.\n\nThis inter-temporal map can also be used to study the interactions between the Moon and Earth. As the gravity of celestial bodies such as the Sun and the Moon varies with time, the inter-temporal map will reveal how these variations affect gravity readings from these bodies. ESO scientist Yves Lafforgue explains:\n\n\"For example, if the Moon is moving away from the Earth at 1.3 cm\/s, its gravity, measured by the Interplanetary Network and ESO's SOHO spacecraft (which have very high precision measurements), should increase. If instead, it is moving towards the Earth, it should decrease. One of the scientific tasks for which this map will be particularly suited is a study of lunar dust, by which we mean a detailed study of the structure of lunar dust grains and how they are thrown around the Moon. It is already known that the gravity of the space environment around the Moon is stronger and more dynamic than we might had

{"id":3692,"ended":true,"length":685,"text":"Riding horses were used by a variety of people during the Middle Ages, and so varied greatly in quality, size and breeding. Knights and nobles kept riding horses in their war @ http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/wires\/afp\/article-2273857\/NIGHT-BRIEFS-Riding-horses-various-peoples.html?ITO=1490\n\nOne of the earliest extant documents describing the training of riding horses for military purposes is the Codex Gigas, which is dated to 9th-century Syria. The codex describes in detail how to train both military and cavalry horses. The use of horses for military purposes by the Magi is recorded in the Hebrew Bible in 2 Kings. In the Book of Judges, Gideon was said to have defeated the Midianites on the backs of a hundred and threescore horses. The Bible also mentions the training of horses by Abraham in Genesis, the training by Moses in Deuteronomy, and finally by David in 2 Samuel.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, horses were used extensively by the military, and were primarily used by knights and other nobles. Horses were bred and trained for different purposes. There was a type of riding horse called a war horse that could pull cannons, cart the equipment of knights, and even serve as their mounts (as seen in the famous scene in the movie The Seventh Seal, where the knight rides off after killing the giant and dismounts to pick up the crossbow, which is being fired for the first time ). However, as with most things in the Middle Ages, both nobility and commoners had a wide range of different riding horses.\n\nKnight's horses\n\nAt the beginning of the 12th century, the mounted knights who fought in the Holy Land first brought this new form of combat to England. Their horses were highly trained, well-behaved, and very useful. However, they were also very expensive, and so only the nobility could afford them. Many of them were bred specifically to fight in the Middle East. Another type of horses that the knight could get his hands on were working horses. These would pull carts, pull plows, etc. These working horses were mainly used by the nobles, and not as fighting mounts ; in fact, they were typically much smaller than fighting horses. Although knights would occasionally ride these types of horses, they didn't usually like to, because they were a lot less versatile than fighting horses. Since the horsemen had a much larger population than the knights, it was cheaper for them to use the working horses, rather than the fighting ones. It should be noted here that there was an exception to this rule. On the continent, horses of this type were commonly used by peasants as well as nobles. This was because they were used by soldiers and people who worked in the fields.\n\nRiding horses were also commonly used by craftsmen and merchants. They were used primarily for plowing fields and carts. Merchants would carry their goods on horseback over long distances. In addition, they were used in the construction industry, as well as in the textile industry.\n\nTriceratops is possibly the best example of modern breeds of horses. It is also called \"motorcycle horse\" because of the high speed at which it can trot. This is not the only example of a fast-mover ; horses can also trot (or gallop ) at about 7 miles per hour. However, they can go much faster than this, especially if trained to do so. One reason triceratops can trot so fast is because it has a lot of extra meat and muscle in its back to allow its bones to hold up the back of the horse. It also has a very short neck. The shorter the neck, the higher the speed.","token_len":785,"entropy":[9.2024,7.2971,4.7282,3.6141,3.0858,4.2181,4.0716,0.0056,2.6259,3.6565,0.4967,2.8753,0.0437,1.154,1.7755,6.1276,8.3033,8.2985,0.7797,3.5894,2.1334,3.8636,1.0882,7.7481,2.1723,9.4508,2.0748,4.0454,5.9039,5.3683,0.1619,2.3864,1.7632,8.2703,12.8705,5.6838,0.0008,0.8999,0.0009,5.9944,0.9314,0.0006,0.0009,0.0004,0.0009,0.0032,5.6613,0.2561,0.0104,7.579,3.3071,0.6246,0.72,0.0233,7.1752,3.9014,4.7501,0.0933,5.5346,5.8617,0.3953,3.1495,5.9335,3.6427,1.6026,0.1095,3.0888,1.6836,0.0072,3.3136,0.001,0.0785,9.5351,1.0556,0.0529,8.1293,1.0993,2.3612,0.0044,3.465,6.2788,7.0676,0.3085,5.9444,5.3959,2.4206,0.004,4.9749,0.9813,0.2533,2.5924,6.305,4.4404,4.3453,1.2353,6.2025,0.2863,4.2927,0.0566,4.3044,3.6571,1.0575,1.2271,1.3078,3.5939,9.2367,2.8697,1.4653,1.6007,2.1588,1.9595,1.47,4.7612,3.1523,1.7642,4.7598,7.3081,1.0618,1.4466,4.153,0.0592,2.7417,5.9467,0.2783,1.4223,2.7859,1.4926,6.1048,5.6823,0.4747,1.723,0.8466,1.5777,1.6243,6.4777,0.0278,1.2142,1.3466,1.5376,0.6859,3.7437,0.9895,5.6725,1.4963,2.437,4.9871,0.6768,0.7836,7.7662,1.1446,3.5872,3.937,1.2678,3.7672,2.5651,1.2982,2.6941,0.0049,2.4584,0.8894,8.4484,4.0451,4.5484,0.024,0.3006,8.3965,1.7608,7.9528,0.1059,0.1536,3.6662,1.408,6.6416,0.0045,2.0323,5.6763,3.5127,9.6916,1.8453,0.3306,0.0058,1.3664,0.9431,1.7702,4.2993,1.1383,1.754,1.7057,2.6795,0.0874,1.271,1.8116,4.9486,2.2026,5.8803,3.3883,3.35,9.2199,4.337,1.7534,1.1421,4.1672,0.0427,0.0008,0.7904,0.4835,6.036,1.265,4.1509,0.5058,3.5495,3.2834,0.2795,1.1738,0.0002,2.7526,1.1496,3.3537,0.0101,0.4044,2.0838,0.5323,1.2813,4.4778,1.4025,1.4921,3.7873,2.1088,2.0114,2.2412,6.341,0.2653,1.7889,2.6997,1.0552,4.9274,2.2027,0.8623,2.8217,0.5679,5.1884,3.0918,1.5976,1.8859,4.9251,1.6942,2.0016,4.5239,1.9739,1.1574,7.3955,0.1161,3.0256,1.3504,0.9992,0.9549,6.1842,1.0909,3.0797,3.0355,6.305,11.414,1.5919,7.8661,7.4487,9.0332,1.2468,3.3378,0.8177,0.6472,2.2882,5.3496,0.1953,6.5409,4.2497,4.0599,4.2147,4.1096,0.247,0.8027,5.1188,3.0576,0.7293,1.3674,2.1812,2.6875,6.9193,0.7706,2.3579,0.9749,1.7142,4.356,3.413,4.1391,4.7669,3.5094,1.807,5.9705,5.0247,6.6014,1.1026,0.1287,1.9731,5.2615,0.3187,1.188,6.0693,0.6089,2.4181,2.6308,1.3667,5.5641,4.7187,5.3824,1.5261,2.7963,0.0121,6.9685,3.8938,0.0536,3.909,2.6893,2.1558,2.9416,0.4576,2.0773,1.4058,0.0125,0.0886,6.6707,6.7766,0.0231,4.3722,0.2894,3.352,2.7181,4.0713,1.2861,0.0345,3.2839,2.461,1.1916,0.9746,1.4263,0.0002,6.884,3.953,2.6804,2.6938,0.0002,4.7252,0.6617,1.5012,0.0201,0.074,4.1018,0.0126,0.1054,0.4569,1.5468,7.9345,1.6404,4.3732,2.8463,0.7872,0.5615,5.6348,1.3635,6.8128,4.5326,5.339,3.9551,3.3363,0.0413,4.8602,0.6679,3.6148,0.4818,4.0655,2.428,0.4636,5.5307,1.6957,1.5656,4.6102,1.4096,5.3304,0.0013,0.3166,0.3478,3.408,4.6771,1.5641,3.8272,0.0347,2.4296,0.7655,1.8208,2.1214,3.0533,1.7206,0.8447,3.5179,5.2419,2.1916,4.0002,1.1335,0.2776,0.7317,0.2189,4.376,1.5318,1.7985,1.2029,4.8747,6.1219,1.3854,1.7927,0.9013,1.006,2.122,4.675,1.5399,6.6363,2.9297,0.0809,4.2317,2.3773,3.0961,4.1986,3.8835,4.9774,1.5066,0.3729,0.0056,1.0618,9.3764,0.7453,0.8713,1.4051,6.3684,5.1116,2.1601,1.0394,4.9807,5.7836,1.8242,0.1685,4.1898,0.7032,2.8733,4.8953,0.1547,0.675,6.1824,0.826,1.2652,1.4527,2.5853,1.9533,1.2432,4.8524,3.4323,4.2116,3.3159,9.3848,3.8445,0.4071,0.1331,1.0103,0.3315,6.1372,5.4098,2.6047,0.5568,4.4724,0.5409,0.6769,5.1956,4.0852,3.8018,3.9939,2.6014,4.0313,5.0911,0.0285,0.3755,0.8266,0.6507,4.7535,0.0011,2.7071,6.0549,1.0728,5.4413,2.1878,0.4913,0.7332,4.1561,2.8446,2.7559,4.195,1.293,1.8502,0.2029,0.2817,6.2262,1.5951,3.9451,2.9879,2.7409,2.4113,2.9502,2.2875,5.5416,1.1303,1.119,1.3728,0.3087,2.2708,0.5657,5.3879,1.4379,0.4437,0.0432,3.3239,2.6398,1.5046,0.416,2.425,3.9075,0.0113,1.9146,3.0016,2.6271,0.3537,4.1178,5.3941,0.3442,0.1528,4.3902,0.1655,3.2618,1.4166,3.083,2.8606,0.404,0.3291,0.2652,1.4682,5.4312,0.5769,5.8556,2.5962,3.6254,4.4738,3.4739,0.3616,0.6039,4.188,1.4295,1.09,4.1882,2.3253,2.9044,0.6607,2.8791,0.6994,3.1647,1.6547,1.4192,1.7365,0.4791,2.9601,1.9565,4.6581,1.8381,5.6114,1.4087,4.2609,1.2251,1.0817,0.9603,1.0344,1.307,0.0002,4.6676,0.2533,0.4242,1.1751,1.6125,4.5903,0.5317,0.5151,6.4458,0.0111,1.6849,2.4977,0.8732,2.2699,0.4463,1.7822,3.6477,1.2574,6.6557,0.6953,3.1237,1.2704,6.2617,1.0418,7.2127,2.8379,3.5968,1.7668,0.8347,2.8437,1.9277,0.0142,6.4932,2.6423,0.1024,2.1485,3.0574,2.1566,0.3872,1.9101,0.8915,1.3342,3.1059,1.7912,3.3128,2.6768,1.2263,2.2161,0.8989,0.0901,1.7442,1.392,5.0768,0.4355,0.4108,1.8363,0.0002,5.183,6.4059,1.9143,1.1321,0.8172,4.6234,6.3746,0.3255,3.534,2.783,0.1105,6.5407,8.9935,0.2311,2.098,0.7633,2.4962,0.9361,3.8258,5.29,2.4142,5.6317,3.066,3.5627,2.5793,0.7714,0.415,1.3617,1.0761,3.8348,2.0305,3.2479,0.0022,1.0188,2.2435,7.9358,0.203,1.3991,3.129,1.6536,3.331,2.5997,1.2492,1.8838,0.2569,2.1369,7.2252,2.05,6.0191,1.9707,8.5494,3.242,3.1414,0.5615,6.9426,0.0044,5.3561,2.4918,4.6875,0.0046,5.245,2.9556,6.2593,4.9786,1.92,0.236,0.0089,0.8366,3.5695,0.0178,3.2308,1.8118,4.7235,3.6698,0.8485,0.7295,1.3171

{"id":4115,"ended":true,"length":721,"text":"The video is set to tell the story of a samurai @ - @ in @ - @ training, who falls in love with her master while a jealous peer fights for his affection, and how the master is affected by it.\n@ - @ I've got the story, but no @ - @ animation done yet.\nIt'll have sound effects, so if it looks boring without those, let me know & I'll @ - @ em in.\nAny help on the @ - @ will be appreciated.\nI'll try to get it done within a couple of days, if I can.\nThis was really weird.\nIt started out as two - pager.\nThen I posted it on DeviantArt.\nI've also posted it in a journal.\nThen I read your page... then I thought you were cool & wanted to talk to you.\nSince you were a \"friend of a friend\" we'd know each other in real life, too.\nYay!\nThen I finally get to talk to you in real life, and all I want to do is ask you if you have any plans for the weekend or if you have time for tutoring and I have to ask you to tutor me, instead!\nOh, what a waste.\nHow sad.\nAnd that was just what we talked about.\nUgh.\nYou were so nice and understanding too.\nI almost told you you were wonderful.\nI almost told you that I wanted your hand in marriage.\nAlmost.\nBut I didn't.\nIt was too much to ask.\n* * * * * * * * * * On the next episode of The Life and Times of a Teenage Bitch, we talk about...\nWell, I don't know what happened, but it was bad.\nI'm taking a break from school right now until I feel like I'm ready to return.\nI'm also taking a break from dating.\nI'm not sure what I'm waiting for, but I'll be sure to let everyone know when I know what I want.\nAs far as school goes, I got a C which doesn't sound bad until you start thinking about where it landed on the curve.\nI could have done better.\nI've actually gotten a C in most of the classes I've ever taken.\nIt's usually with straight A's at the start, and a couple of C's here and there which come from stupid mistakes and misunderstandings.\nSo that's a little disheartening.\nOh, and I'm failing French.\nYup.\nI may or may not have forgotten French every day since about the last 2 months of school.\nWhat kind of student am I...?!\nI've been thinking it was time to take a break from school, though.\nI'm getting tired of doing online classes.\nI'd rather be with my friends or doing something that will be more beneficial to me than writing papers.\nSo I think that's what I'll do.\nI haven't figured out the details yet, but I'll probably just take a few courses at the community college for the time being.\nI'll probably try to find a job or something as well.\nI'm thinking I'll go back in late summer \/ early fall of this year... not sure what my situation will be then and how I'll decide between full - time employment or online classes...\nIt'll

{"id":822,"ended":true,"length":739,"text":"At the time of the discovery of the body, Gordon and his third wife, Jenny, were on a cycling holiday in France. They heard news of the discovery of the body by the local authorities when they arrived back in Jersey.\n\nGordon was born in Jersey, the son of John Gordon, who was a merchant ship captain. His mother was Mary Louise.\n\nIn 1910, Gordon married his first wife, Mary Ann Gordon. The couple had two daughters but the marriage ended after a year and he married his next wife in 1912, Mary Elizabeth Gordon. The couple remained married for 38 and a half years.\n\nAfter leaving school, Gordon went to work for the Jersey Shipping Association. One of Gordon's duties involved shipping passengers across the ocean on the. Once in the US, they passed through immigration and customs. Before leaving, his job was to make sure that everyone got through with the correct amount of money.\n\nHe also worked as a clerk at Jersey City's Post Office.\n\nGordon served as both a member of the Jersey City Council and the Jersey City Board of Education.\n\nGordon also served in World War I. During his service time, he was stationed in England. While in England, he was able to see some action.\n\nGordon left his position with the Jersey Shipping Association in 1922. He worked in a variety of positions until his retirement in 1960.\n\nIn his free time, Gordon enjoyed playing golf. He was also an avid fisherman. While in England, he caught a 20 lb Kingfish. During his fishing expeditions, Gordon frequently brought back to Jersey the fish that he caught. When he was back in Jersey, the fish that were landed were usually displayed on the side of the street.\n\n\" A man should consider himself lucky who catches such a fish as Gordon caught.\"\n\nWhile living in England, the family was often visited by friends including the daughter of the Earl of Dunraven, Lady Evelyn. One day, Lady Evelyn took the children to see the local dog show. On their way home, Gordon picked up his wife and their friend, John Harkness. They all got into the car to return home.\n\nA little while later, Gordon noticed what appeared to be a burning car. When he looked over his shoulder, he saw that the car was on fire. Although he was able to put out the fire, the car was soon completely burnt out.\n\nAt the time, Gordon didn't realize that the passenger of the car had been a member of the royal family. The young prince had been sitting in the back of the car with his mother and had been knocked out from the heat of the fire.\n\nGordon's wife and Lady Evelyn were also knocked unconscious by the fire. When he saw it was too late to rescue the young prince, Gordon turned around and grabbed the Prince's sister, Lady Patricia. He pulled her through the passenger's window. Fortunately, the young princess's injuries were only minor and none of the family died. Gordon and his wife were only burned a little.\n\n\" If Gordon had not turned the princess out of the car. the royal family would be lost.\"\n\nFollowing the accident, the two princes were sent to spend the summer vacation with their grandmother, Queen Alexandra. They also began studying in Switzerland. When they came to England the following fall, they were taken under the protection of King George V and Queen Mary.\n\nThe Royal Family began to distance themselves from Gordon after the accident. The young Princesses were homeschooled on the advice of Queen Alexandra. Because of this, they didn't form close relationships with Gordon.\n\nGordon's health began to rapidly decline in 1930.

{"id":3708,"ended":true,"length":736,"text":"< unk > catabolism is the breakdown of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is the catabolism of glucose itself. Although glucose has a much stronger tendency to bind to the ribose moiety, other monosaccharides may also contribute to the eventual breakdown of glucose through catabolism. The reaction leading to the destruction of the cell is the formation of pyruvate from glucose. This reaction is also affected, in some cases, by certain enzymes ( see also chapter on cell and tissue respiration ). The final products of cell and tissue respiration are also pyruvates ( glucose + carbon monoxide + water = pyruvate. Once in the cells, pyruvate may then be converted to different substances, depending on the chemical conditions of the cell.\n\nThere are a number of ways that cells can use sugar in order to get energy ( and that is in most cases the prime use that they would have for sugar ). The most general of these ways is to convert it into a form that is usable by the cell. A breakdown of sugars into simpler and simpler molecules takes place. At the same time, cells have a number of means that they can use sugar. They can\n\n1 ) use it to produce ATP ( energy ) 2 ) use it to produce new molecules of amino acids ( building blocks for proteins ). 3 ) use it as a source of fuel ( this is a more general use for sugar than many of the other ways that sugar is used ) 4 ) use it to make chemicals, both directly ( a compound containing the same monosaccharide in a variety of other molecules ) as well as indirectly by using a protein that acts on the monosaccharide in this way. 5 ) some cells use the sugar to make DNA ( genetic information ). In each of these cases, the cell may also draw in other molecules of oxygen through the process of gas exchange.\n\nWhen a cell uses sugar, the result is that the cell ends up with an excess of glucose. This excess of glucose becomes pyruvate as it circulates in the blood. This excess is taken up by the body's organs. The liver in particular needs an excess of glucose to store glycogen for its immediate use ( as it acts as a sugar storage organ ). Some of the glucose can also be converted by glycogen to sugar which is then turned into sugar. This is a much slower process than it is for glucose. The conversion of the glucose to sugar involves splitting the molecule of glucose into its two constituent sugars. This splitting process occurs more quickly when the glucose concentration in the blood is higher ( this is also the case for glucose itself ). When a sufficient concentration of glucose reaches the liver, it can start to convert the excess to sugar as soon as it arrives. The reason that this process of conversion takes place is that glucose will be converted into sugar more rapidly than it is processed by the liver into glycogen. If there are no cells in the body that require glucose, then they can also use the glucose ( in this case, to build glycogen ), and the body would have the glucose that it needs for this purpose. On the other hand, cells that do require glucose, or cells that want to make use of the stored glucose, will be able to use the glucose without having to worry about storing it beforehand. An added advantage of this last kind of processing is that the cell itself will have less sugar to use. One of the problems that cells have in making use of glucose is that a glucose molecule is highly reactive. Because of this fact, the cell can also use it as a source of energy, but it is necessary for the cell to make use of it in one way or another.","token_len":786,"entropy":[9.1943,7.6379,6.8885,11.6147,10.9499,0.1594,4.7525,2.5408,6.4847,0.066,5.793,1.4525,4.8435,3.1516,2.386,5.2038,0.2676,0.0245,0.9294,5.0244,4.414,3.7788,5.7919,6.8951,0.7516,1.4111,0.8581,5.7862,0.0001,3.9459,9.5443,1.6196,0.039,0.0016,0.038,1.0687,4.7828,5.3721,2.0737,2.3164,7.2486,7.9136,0.9043,3.2329,0.8919,2.8223,5.666,0.2601,0.1283,0.4798,2.093,6.0953,0.5983,5.1567,2.3086,3.2519,1.8921,3.336,4.8181,5.2827,0.2719,4.662,0.3822,2.4763,6.0506,3.2616,9.0162,0.3417,1.2911,5.7968,4.3347,0.1247,0.0057,0.0005,0.0455,3.5266,2.1861,6.5914,0.538,1.1833,9.0694,0.2464,0.148,1.4587,5.1617,3.8072,0.0412,0.0203,0.4054,2.3894,6.6386,4.8262,0.1299,1.5136,7.2983,0.0169,2.4051,5.1729,2.4591,2.4272,3.9656,0.0157,5.988,0.0562,0.0081,0.0053,5.0448,2.2056,1.121,2.079,2.5624,1.1661,3.7751,7.3717,6.6831,2.5196,2.6412,0.4369,0.3403,0.0777,6.2101,2.9281,3.4664,9.7665,3.8769,6.1933,1.8164,5.1491,4.0703,3.1087,7.0085,0.0046,0.6026,1.9643,6.0212,4.6906,0.3702,5.093,2.1232,0.3298,0.7939,0.0003,0.4668,4.6031,3.5051,0.0002,0.0062,3.4681,2.2437,6.0403,6.214,4.2458,3.5187,0.0295,3.9409,3.6573,5.353,1.4658,0.0041,0.0338,0.1215,5.6966,8.1251,3.4753,0.5366,3.1339,0.2486,1.505,0.0003,0.0065,0.442,4.7627,2.9409,0.9075,1.5066,0.5475,7.3116,3.8649,1.8027,4.0025,0.1209,0.4489,4.0536,4.9341,1.8808,0.127,0.7477,0.6822,2.7934,0.0308,4.5903,0.4182,2.519,0.5897,0.0086,2.6493,1.9956,3.2957,1.3008,4.1647,5.955,2.4638,3.9898,0.0033,3.7199,3.4274,3.0131,4.5836,5.1482,2.3086,4.4775,4.5054,0.5646,2.5897,10.8551,4.9935,6.0031,2.886,2.7015,2.0662,2.5667,2.9189,3.1033,1.8394,1.3731,6.3356,3.4672,0.3311,3.65,0.349,1.605,2.0738,3.8755,0.9856,2.8675,2.5131,2.4571,1.1811,5.2408,1.5631,1.0037,2.0313,1.2553,3.3876,8.0624,0.9173,4.2425,1.5574,7.4891,3.9899,2.9474,2.9554,5.1683,0.417,3.7319,5.5046,1.2323,1.8734,0.0053,0.2888,4.1664,3.3079,1.5444,3.4742,0.0094,4.9376,3.7512,0.8199,0.0983,1.1525,1.2481,2.3279,3.0238,0.5116,8.5162,0.0004,3.5677,3.3466,3.5294,1.6208,0.9989,2.9789,3.133,1.485,4.4458,0.6823,2.2008,0.0868,1.4887,0.0713,0.2491,1.8399,6.7034,2.2384,3.2856,5.0179,0.1713,1.2616,8.2411,0.0375,2.8666,1.3104,3.4099,0.8272,0.0302,0.5937,0.0608,3.1093,0.5831,3.2402,0.0396,4.1189,1.5061,6.4511,0.8815,2.9237,4.4359,1.7387,2.9237,3.2013,2.154,3.346,5.7221,1.5522,0.1193,0.7898,2.5308,2.0685,2.1482,0.8067,0.3913,1.7171,0.4636,0.0264,0.5027,0.0493,0.5643,2.3685,6.055,3.1403,6.1784,5.0085,2.6184,4.5723,4.0528,5.1543,3.8104,3.0585,6.9753,0.2792,0.01,0.0005,0.7016,3.3513,1.9371,4.9075,0.0076,3.5963,2.8137,1.7216,6.3412,0.4475,0.0133,0.1182,4.2846,3.2874,4.2086,5.5546,3.4861,6.1862,1.6719,1.5335,3.0309,0.0302,0.0048,0.003,0.1607,2.8201,5.2353,0.3277,1.649,1.7245,0.0368,8.5647,3.5059,1.4611,3.0593,1.3313,1.1117,1.276,6.4904,1.7239,7.17,2.667,2.5459,4.1767,6.2492,1.3151,0.0803,1.4227,0.3603,0.9423,1.9193,4.5364,2.8003,7.6723,4.0135,3.4436,1.1126,1.6702,7.8811,5.9743,1.4511,3.6598,0.1781,7.2759,0.3823,0.7733,1.4692,0.0005,4.6466,2.6341,0.544,1.8321,0.6967,1.2386,2.0434,5.7884,0.4428,1.8813,1.6368,1.485,7.3446,0.0078,0.8575,2.8806,5.0566,0.3432,1.116,1.3507,1.6118,1.12,2.0741,0.081,4.7621,6.7172,0.0009,0.0054,0.0171,3.9929,1.4667,6.1709,0.0006,2.418,0.3062,3.3926,0.897,2.0686,1.7,2.4621,5.4577,0.2466,0.5019,0.8342,3.3416,2.6808,5.1225,2.1857,1.6734,3.0917,5.7262,1.2493,4.2137,4.4328,1.304,0.0884,0.344,0.7993,5.8859,2.3047,0.0051,2.745,2.5151,8.372,2.7216,2.6123,4.2138,2.4979,6.3162,0.9543,0.506,4.9158,3.2353,3.0215,0.7852,5.2823,1.7411,0.361,2.462,3.9437,2.1045,0.239,1.1783,3.8648,7.112,0.0244,2.1036,4.7894,4.4699,0.9159,1.3025,4.7059,0.1162,4.1964,1.7725,2.1556,1.7789,2.787,3.913,4.9604,0.175,1.2382,4.6716,1.7913,0.6131,0.9637,1.2969,1.8185,4.3637,0.5754,3.1899,0.493,0.9437,1.19,4.2305,7.4086,0.9471,3.9138,1.7072,0.6876,0.7601,3.9883,2.7484,1.5007,2.2797,1.0958,1.9597,5.6289,2.2289,3.6117,4.6035,2.1795,3.2677,0.9527,1.9349,5.4953,2.1479,0.3402,2.0117,0.5053,2.653,2.6179,4.271,0.4766,2.8017,1.4078,0.45,1.016,1.2807,4.3796,0.4926,3.4748,2.8267,9.0363,1.6383,0.2283,0.2726,3.8299,0.3093,1.6743,0.498,1.5212,1.9504,5.9753,0.6031,2.0363,1.0061,3.7548,2.9161,1.4359,3.8402,4.0512,0.0045,0.9634,4.9109,0.7774,1.8872,6.7288,2.1092,1.4313,1.9564,3.5304,1.093,2.4055,0.1862,0.8392,0.8011,2.2507,4.953,1.6709,1.2453,1.7003,2.3586,4.0102,1.6234,1.2291,1.2242,1.4384,5.5287,2.3667,0.4512,0.7197,5.7524,3.1013,0.0095,0.6054,3.7673,3.4365,1.776,2.5698,5.1654,1.3033,0.162,1.0478,0.9923,5.0106,1.0203,1.1692,1.5602,4.1281,1.9336,4.4704,1.5816,1.9101,1.3552,4.5594,4.0378,1.5322,0.0709,1.555,4.3877,3.4969,4.3252,0.0029,4.0869,1.9068,1.9495,2.8565,4.2368,2.8017,4.3978,2.1025,3.8845,0.6004,0.2743,2.2257,4.6209,0.6872,0.5997,6.0161,0.104,0.0529,0.0143,0.0249,3.7816,1.0052,1.9209,3.0953,0.4173,2.8953,3.1804,4.9411,0.1596,4.8974,0.4233,3.783,3.8978,0.0053,1.8016,5.8517,0.4853,0.678,1.9119,3.2104,1.9113,0.0135,0.5277,1.2443,0.9071,4.2709,2.7736,0.1654,4.5848,0.0888,4.9326,0.4169,8.8798,0.4128,6.1015,6.3681,2.1658,0.3387,1.5775,8.0035,4.9228,0.0087,5.332,0.3321,0.0555,1.8234,2.8

{"id":3701,"ended":true,"length":700,"text":"Proteins are made of amino acids arranged in a linear chain joined together by peptide bonds. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze the chemical reactions in metabolism. Other proteins have structural or mechanical properties relevant to the functions of cells.\n\nIn most cases, proteins are produced by special cells called muscle cells, endocrine cells, or liver cells. These cells produce proteins from specific genes that code for the amino acids used to synthesize those proteins. These genes encode the enzymes used to make the proteins from the amino acids.\n\nProteins are broken down into amino acids into different chemical mixtures called plasma amino acids and are reassembled into new proteins.\n\nThe information from the amino acid sequence of a protein predicts its function. The human brain contains about 1 million proteins.\n\nMost amino acids are not used by the human body; they are recycled and reused as building blocks for the building of new structures. However, essential amino acids that are used by all cells or for the production of proteins that participate in most biological processes have a shortage. The protein synthesis rate is increased by consuming extra amino acids known as \"nutritional amino acids\".\n\nNucleotides\n\nThe DNA molecule and the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, which carries the genetic instructions for amino acid synthesis within the cell, contain a sequence of nucleotides in which the bases A, C, T, and G are attached at specific sites in the sugar molecule called the nucleotide sequence. In the human genome, there are about 21,000 nucleotides.\n\nAll the 21,000 nucleotides are needed to code for the 21 million proteins in the human body. About 7% or 14,000\u201315,000 amino acids are needed to synthesize the proteins in a normal human.\n\nThere are also different kinds of amino acids that are commonly found in food, such as protein, sugar, salt, alcohol, fatty acids, and other substances, but none of them are essential for humans to survive. Most proteins in the cell are synthesized from the amino acids in the sugar.\n\nFusion proteins\n\nAs the body uses more protein in its tissues, one may be able to use more than one protein during any one process or reaction. Fusion proteins are one example of a combination of two or more proteins that work as a single protein. If two proteins are fusion proteins, they can work together to make a process more efficient, because they can do the same work better than an individual protein can. Fusions can also be used to improve the efficiency of other kinds of fusion.\n\nFusion proteins can be made from two or more enzymes. These fusion proteins can be made in many different ways. In some cases, two proteins that are produced naturally can be joined together. When a fusion protein is produced in a laboratory by joining together the segments of two different proteins, each protein segment has its own place in the completed fusion protein.\n\nOne example of a fusion protein is the fusion of the enzymes ATPase and helicase. These enzymes can hydrolyze the phosphate groups of ATP. In this case, they are two separate enzymes working together, as the phosphate groups are broken down before hydrolysis.\n\nAnother example of a fusion protein is called \"mosaic fusion protein\". The mosaic protein consists of two distinct, small fragments of amino acids. When the two small fragments join and form a protein, the two subunits of the recombinant protein can do two or three things instead of one.\n\nFusion of two or more enzymes may be used to improve the characteristics of particular enzymes.

{"id":1701,"ended":true,"length":723,"text":"Goffman's early works consist of his graduate writings of 1949 \u2013 53. His master's thesis was a survey of audience responses to a radio soap opera, Big Sister. One of the audience members, the Reverend Fred Jones, was a Christian apologist who had an ongoing, friendly rivalry with the secular, atheist scholar, C. Vann Woodward, whose book, God is Not Good, Goldstein was now writing to defend. Although Goldstein was at the time primarily writing about religion, the radio drama seemed to demand that he also write something about politics and society.\n\nThe thesis was published in two volumes, along with an extensive bibliography and critical commentary, as two separate books, The Audience of One: The American Public Forum (New York: Columbia University Press, 1955) and The Audience as Audience: An Inquiry into the Meaning of Public Life (New York: Columbia University Press, 1958). Goldstein also published a few shorter works of his own that same year, the first being The Experience of Human Emotion (Oxford: OUP, 1957).\n\nThesis\n\nHe followed this up shortly with a long consideration of the question, \"Can we learn anything about the functioning and nature of the human mind from psychological research, particularly from the experimental research of Pavlov and B. C. Waddington?\" His answer was in the negative. The main reason for this was that Goldstein came to the conclusion that although the brain processes involved in thought could be observed and discussed, the process of thought itself could not be observed directly, but only indirectly.\n\nOther works\n\n\"It was the age of the middle class\u2014the time between a 'new industrialism' and the promise of a new socialism\u2014and the tension between these two trends was the tension of the late fifties. While the first trend had made many advances, it had also left the future of American industry uncertain. Indeed, the very presence of the mass market, which the new industries relied upon for volume and support, remained uncertain.\"\n\n\u2014 The New Press, September 10, 1960.\n\n\"The most immediate and critical problem of the day was the problem of education. In 1956, more than 1,500,000 teenagers were enrolled in junior colleges and more than two million attended high schools in the United States and Canada. While millions of teenagers seemed to believe that they would someday enter college\u2014and some would do so and become college professors, university administrators, and university trustees\u2014it was an open question whether they should bother to learn anything about those things in college that were most directly relevant to their lives and careers. At that time, most students did not expect to work in factories, the mines, the lumber camps, or in the farms of the rural South.\"\n\n\"From the point of view of higher education, there were two problems. First, a large number of high school graduates were not going to college. Indeed, according to official statistics released this year, only a quarter of the high school graduates of 1956 applied to college. As a result, those students who had not planned to major in either literature or mathematics were free to spend their college years in courses in subjects that bore little or no relationship to the professional needs and the life-long interests of the students who did plan to become professional men and women.\"\n\nGoffman, Peter C.

{"id":4971,"ended":true,"length":709,"text":"Infamous Second Son sold over one million copies nine days after its launch. = 1973 Pacific hurricane season = The 1973 Pacific hurricane season was an event in tropical cyclone meteorology. The most powerful one \u2013 Hurricane Hiki \u2013 hit the Hawaiian Islands in a month that produced an excess of tropical cyclones. It brought the largest number of hurricanes to Hawaii in a single season. #\n\nIn the U.S., Florida had an annual hurricane average of six \u2013 with many severe cases. In the state, hurricanes were named after women, from Anna and Betsy in 1948 through Frances and Jeanne in 1979. #\n\nThe next hurricane name was Sandy which hit in October. This hurricane also hit New York City and had wind speeds above the criteria of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 because. #\n\nHurricane Sandy brought Hurricane Katrina\u2019s damage to New York City and its neighboring states. About $60 billion was caused by Hurricane Sandy. New York City also experienced a historic blackout because of the storm. All that is in the U.S. #\n\nOn the U.S. West coast, there was a historic rainfall of 5.76\u2033 because of Hurricane Earl in 2011. The rain created a lot of flooding in the Pacific Northwest and caused the second-highest flood toll. #\n\nIn 2011, a major flood affected Colorado, Wyoming and Utah which killed over 20 people. That flood was caused by the heaviest rain of the season at that time. #\n\nThe highest and lowest rainfall totals recorded by a single season in Colorado were in 2012. During that season, there were 6.12\" and 3.46\" of rainfall. When combined, they produced the second-highest rainfall since recordkeeping began in 1876.\n\nThe record highest and lowest rainfall in a single season was also in 2012. While that was a record, many parts of the world including the United States had extreme rainfalls in the same season.\n\nIn the United States, there were major floods in Louisiana, Alabama, Michigan, Ohio, Georgia, Indiana, Washington, Missouri, Mississippi and other parts of the country. A major flood is one that causes local problems such as the one above which may be more expensive than a minor flood.\n\nThe largest flooding caused by a hurricane happened in 1973 which was in the same season that Hurricanes Betsy and Anna hit the U.S. A major flood occurs when more than 15% of the average level is measured on a 24-hour period. In this case, the flooding reached 18% above the level that had been measured in a previous flood. The highest recorded major flood is 30.4% of average.\n\nThe average value here is based on the median which is the value that is equal to half of half the data points. In this case, the median is.18 \" above flood level. #\n\nFloods like the one above also have a psychological impact. The people and property affected experience an emotional distress during and after a major flooding incident because it is a natural hazard.\n\nIn addition, people who are affected may not return to the area after the flooding subsides because the memories of the flood may be too disturbing. This is particularly true for flooding incidents like the one above. The people may stay in shelters and seek assistance from others instead of rebuilding their homes. #\n\nIn general, about 5% of the world\u2019s population lives and works in disaster-prone areas. According to the disaster management report prepared by the World Bank and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, about 60% of all disasters happen in low- or middle-income countries. #\n\nWith the rate of human development increasing rapidly and the rate of disasters increasing every year, disasters will cause more problems. As the global population continues to grow, there will be more people working in disaster-prone areas.","token_len":787,"entropy":[8.8943,8.2474,2.7526,10.7137,3.5148,4.8472,0.2097,0.1446,11.5224,2.6354,0.7268,1.681,3.9336,1.0631,11.5416,13.3349,10.0039,10.8311,4.8492,3.3107,3.24,6.7587,0.7192,0.1582,0.0192,1.4458,3.7083,3.0766,2.3197,7.2194,2.0597,1.4916,9.0276,0.0909,1.41,1.8803,4.0034,2.8236,7.1961,7.5747,2.1763,5.0871,7.5091,0.6282,2.6053,0.8376,4.6722,0.78,1.6729,3.666,7.1543,3.4826,5.8576,3.4799,7.3204,0.1088,4.1125,0.481,1.1415,1.2802,3.2277,5.0238,2.64,4.498,1.7641,0.007,2.6935,1.0846,2.402,1.4058,2.3786,0.6609,3.4839,0.9066,6.3134,5.1306,0.0053,4.2073,1.9724,5.1044,0.0027,0.0387,0.3903,6.9232,3.9536,3.8121,2.9419,1.1575,8.1261,0.1318,5.4982,6.0828,3.7005,5.1409,7.0626,5.2805,3.2348,2.1737,1.6569,6.4827,1.3856,4.4874,1.5774,5.3577,1.0969,7.3389,2.0375,5.3276,8.0412,3.4079,8.6268,3.123,8.427,6.0364,6.3118,2.1395,6.6561,0.4493,5.2421,0.3525,2.4731,0.2363,0.0002,2.2229,6.096,2.9095,7.3274,1.3393,6.1561,5.3773,2.112,4.3545,2.8705,3.5615,4.0438,3.7187,4.3621,2.4404,2.9715,0.7504,0.7842,2.443,4.9149,7.0901,0.1916,4.4301,3.5488,12.3499,1.3482,2.9276,2.041,2.9714,0.7441,7.1464,7.816,0.9702,0.1224,0.0002,3.3606,0.2575,3.0956,5.1217,6.0344,1.8795,15.4962,9.0369,3.2651,5.8789,1.0396,1.9906,1.1653,0.3799,1.7266,3.3087,6.3309,1.2341,0.6074,7.4238,3.779,4.585,1.0476,1.5197,5.5926,0.3066,1.767,0.9713,0.9299,5.3153,0.4321,1.3322,4.632,1.7185,1.9924,6.3218,4.9757,4.5929,0.3759,1.152,1.2253,0.4453,6.1349,4.6806,3.006,4.835,1.4017,4.9142,0.0013,0.0042,0.2737,3.9216,0.1412,0.0002,4.4092,2.2763,3.8966,0.0008,0.0183,0.2295,4.1576,1.8171,0.3451,3.3813,1.1745,0.9422,5.3837,5.1936,1.7783,3.6561,1.284,6.4015,6.3788,6.5107,0.1709,0.5627,8.5617,2.4219,5.4698,0.2527,2.3378,2.6944,5.8042,1.4605,4.665,0.029,2.1111,1.5035,1.2055,5.5149,0.7506,1.6815,2.9946,2.4349,7.0855,3.1731,1.8833,3.6227,6.5557,4.2827,0.7554,0.0691,0.0001,1.7733,5.9994,0.3158,3.1689,3.8255,4.1481,4.8229,7.0474,1.7321,5.3738,1.1478,2.8835,4.388,5.2633,2.8827,3.6224,1.8463,0.6275,5.3639,1.8329,1.7896,2.3979,0.0724,2.0546,5.8334,1.6103,3.0228,0.4885,3.0616,5.0146,4.8016,0.0641,0.4738,0.6835,0.0621,0.0001,2.1724,5.0958,6.2226,3.3796,1.6599,1.1633,3.827,1.8833,2.6842,2.6455,3.8057,2.1208,5.4124,1.5943,2.1732,3.2043,1.252,5.666,1.1161,2.388,0.3979,2.1073,0.2899,4.0968,1.5923,4.9159,5.5568,3.1098,2.7223,0.0511,4.518,0.8178,2.5695,0.9573,0.8863,6.48,2.6674,1.2809,2.9682,1.5709,2.9375,3.3271,0.5787,0.4352,0.9367,6.1742,2.7416,3.257,0.1862,0.4118,2.0877,3.6382,0.2761,4.0712,0.0002,2.0321,4.0414,7.1865,3.6664,0.2977,0.5547,3.7375,1.6767,0.1169,0.4715,1.1778,5.0258,1.9385,2.1975,1.0688,4.9455,3.231,2.1134,2.1905,0.7197,1.804,5.77,5.2358,0.023,0.4098,3.4415,6.9786,1.453,1.8836,0.1222,2.3195,5.9518,3.7678,2.8762,2.2415,1.6998,3.6804,1.1626,0.3695,2.1911,0.0002,2.1798,1.5267,2.8371,0.1039,0.2571,2.0538,0.6169,6.2029,1.8421,1.1493,6.0654,1.3086,3.0458,0.3469,4.3519,0.3698,2.3445,0.3427,4.2701,0.3489,3.5792,0.2477,6.1623,0.366,4.1942,0.2627,3.6034,1.3752,4.7618,1.6725,0.0176,0.1317,0.9589,0.4737,4.5801,2.7122,1.5875,4.7665,2.6283,0.6812,1.6684,8.2198,6.604,1.9113,0.0043,4.4782,6.2942,4.9758,3.946,6.6685,2.2315,3.8927,6.311,1.1448,1.6497,4.2293,2.2927,0.3337,1.5749,0.0002,2.0414,3.9785,3.0206,5.2522,0.338,0.6257,2.4176,5.0517,0.2604,7.2048,3.9871,1.7039,3.9803,0.837,4.5164,1.5253,2.6167,5.0508,7.7214,0.1349,4.2624,1.5317,1.5846,1.5062,0.0015,0.0055,0.0857,4.6808,1.2441,1.0989,5.8228,0.6953,5.2943,0.4952,5.05,2.3238,0.0153,0.5231,6.4184,5.7814,2.5486,6.3763,3.7052,0.8903,5.4878,1.0591,0.0649,4.8529,0.4677,3.0182,2.4836,0.8709,0.1876,1.1948,5.4362,5.6818,4.9208,1.6618,4.3751,1.1315,3.6584,2.5834,3.7972,0.5839,0.9065,2.118,3.6111,4.1538,3.661,0.4186,2.4757,3.7359,2.5898,6.5169,1.0069,3.5903,7.9351,1.5261,2.5551,2.1244,2.1101,4.9143,1.2586,1.5735,0.0002,1.7228,3.8048,4.7468,9.8792,0.7224,4.812,0.1033,1.287,5.7994,8.1998,0.8535,1.5262,3.4845,2.7965,2.0706,5.1959,0.0316,5.8057,0.9513,8.0955,1.284,6.4606,4.2138,1.2065,3.6021,1.9867,0.3477,0.1715,0.7987,2.0917,1.5309,7.4594,10.5012,7.699,7.7819,9.5097,0.8897,0.6323,2.3413,0.0855,0.0002,6.2234,0.0077,1.0903,5.3176,2.0947,0.3571,0.24,4.4761,3.6878,1.2502,8.3808,1.5541,1.6178,2.1281,4.149,3.8948,2.4573,2.5974,6.0985,3.6998,0.9505,4.8018,5.044,5.0689,0.2216,1.4545,1.8016,2.9746,6.842,4.1823,2.6076,1.416,2.3316,4.5689,6.5406,1.3878,2.16,0.0002,2.4876,2.8077,0.6319,3.0024,2.1678,1.5292,1.7832,3.859,3.068,6.5136,0.6812,2.3418,1.7488,2.6674,1.6095,2.4637,8.2677,0.1289,3.0523,2.1821,9.7096,0.5028,0.6935,2.2038,1.8649,1.4068,4.2511,5.3541,1.8483,2.9339,1.3543,3.6968,0.5211,1.1125,8.4616,6.5119,3.4382,1.3106,0.2647,0.3009,0.6123,3.0188,2.8481,3.8845,5.8519,1.0539,5.4432,1.7782,3.8575,3.8343,1.1395,2.3202,5.2975,0.1839,6.6636,1.3935,0.6621,0.4077,2.1189,0.0685,0.0002,2.3362,4.6418,0.0647,7.029,3.647,0.8244,0.1238,1.386,3.5133,12.611,1.8475,0.2435,0.6664,2.8265,6.3992,1.0569,0.2796,6.017,2.452,0.2807,0.2489,0.5397,5.1433,0.007,0.7577,9.2435,3.1641,6.219,4.2602,0.2436,0.3291,1.4077,0.9207,2.7311,1.0955,1.932,3.8723,0.1373,2.5773,0.0028,1.6486,0

{"id":4234,"ended":false,"length":755,"text":"Claire's main storyline in season 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for a sexual assault prevention bill. During her campaign for the bill, a skeleton from her college days is unearthed, and the episode sees her confronting the sexual violence that surrounded her life.\n\nIn a new interview, Brown opens up about Claire's arc in season 2, the #MeToo movement, and more.\n\nClaire's storyline is a big element of season 2, with the First Lady working through dealing with the allegations, the #MeToo movement, how the country has changed, and finally, what happened to her. That means Claire's voice will be a big part of the show overall, even as her plot is only present in select episodes because the show is made as a miniseries.\n\n\"Every single part has been written with her in mind, every character,\" Brown says. \"Claire is always on screen, but I don't know the specifics of who is going to do what, and where that will come out in the show.\"\n\nShe adds that the arc Claire's story took in season 1 was a product of how much time they had to dedicate to it. \"We wrote it in the second season as a complete arc and that's where it is. I'd be excited to tell her story differently or better. I certainly would've liked more time.\"\n\nAs for the #MeToo movement that inspired Brown as she and the team wrote Claire's journey in season 2, she says she's only just beginning to understand what it means.\n\n\"I've probably watched one-quarter of the movies and shows that have come out [about #MeToo]. I'm now actually trying to talk to my daughters. I'm more on their wavelength than mine. It's scary, it's funny, it's tragic. But it's important. I think it's going to be a very transformational thing for our times.\"\n\n\"It's a really important topic for now, for a long time. It hasn't changed that much, but there is an urgency about it now. We all feel the same. We all want it to be better, and it's getting closer to what we wanted it to be. It's a lot.\"\n\nFor Brown and the rest of the team, Claire's story is important. But with each season, they're trying to be a little more realistic and not simply regurgitate an idea from last season.\n\n\"The first year it was a little more of a wish list. That sounds terrible. But we were trying to create for her whatever she would love. In the second season, we were really trying to play with the truth, to let things be what they are and not always trying to rewrite history.\"\n\nFor example, Brown says they gave the idea of an abortion to Claire more thought than they did in the first season. They debated how realistic a position such as that was and whether it would affect political campaigns in the future. And there are some scenes in season 2 that Brown felt would never be written the way they were written in the first season, such as the time Claire encounters the man who sexually assaulted her in college.\n\nClaire gets to confront him in a moment of truth. But it wouldn't have happened in season 1, says Brown.\n\n\"We would never, ever, ever have written her going into a classroom and confronting him in class. It was really important for us that the conversation wasn't in the classroom. I didn't have to get involved in it. We knew what we had to do with the flashbacks.

{"id":2013,"ended":true,"length":666,"text":"The easternmost forming Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, Tropical Storm Christine, originated as a tropical wave over Africa in mid @ - @ August. As it neared the Atlantic Ocean, the system organized gradually, and by 1 @ it was organizing into a tropical depression. The first-named storm of @ year, its central barometric pressure was falling on-center, and convection around it was increasing. A cold core was evident, indicating the system had the beginning of a circulation. Satellite imagery from the @ 12 :00 p.m. CPHW time stamp through the 19 :00 UTC time and the 5:00 p.m. TAFB time stamp showed an organized surface area of low pressure had formed, but the satellite image had yet to show a circulation center. At 11 :04 p.m. UTC the first radar image of the circulation center showed a center of circulation with minimal thunderstorm activity around it.\n\nAt 4 @ a.m. on the 2 @ 0.m. AST, the storm became Tropical Storm Christine. The eye of thestorm formed shortly after that and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on @ 9 @ a.m. CST. The first hurricane and tropical storm of the@ year formed in the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 590 miles (950 km) east-southeastward of the Island of Cura\u00e7ao.\n\nAt 21 :00 UTC, the center of Tropical Storm Christine was located near 24.4\u00b0N 58.8\u00b0W, or about 540 miles (855 km) west-southwestward of Grand Turk Island. At that time, the storm was moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km\/h), and the minimum central pressure was 994 mb (29.88\"). Further intensification of Christine was forecast, and the storm was predicted to become a hurricane early on September 3 as it moved west-northwest. However, after making landfall around noon, the hurricane weakened slightly, making landfall at 24.0\u00b0N 57.4\u00b0W, with a maximum sustained wind speed near 74 mph (120 km\/h) and a minimum central pressure of 992 mb (29.76\"), where it gradually weakened to a minimal tropical storm.\n\nThe storm made landfall approximately 9 miles northwest of Freeport, Grand Bahama Island, with estimated winds of 45 to 60 mph (75-95 km\/h). As the storm moved over the Grand Bahama Island, it reached its peak intensity with estimated maximum sustained winds of 45 to 55 mph (75-95 km\/h). By 11 am central, the winds decreased to tropical-storm force. In the next 48 hours, the intensity of Christine was downgraded to a 50 mph (85 km\/h) storm as it continued slowly moving across the island at 6 mph (9 km\/h). By 0200 EDT, the storm had dissipated as the remnants were absorbed by a trough of low pressure over the northwestern Caribbean Sea.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Christine was the easternmost Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to form before the official opening of hurricane season, and the storm was the largest hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles and the second largest Atlantic hurricane to form in August after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The previous easternmost Atlantic tropical cyclone to form was Hurricane Ivan in 2004.\n\nAlthough Christine and its effects were not strong, it brought record low daytime temperatures to Grand Bahama Island.

{"id":25,"ended":false,"length":735,"text":"Divine behavior was believed to govern all of nature. Except for the few deities who disrupted the divine order, the gods'actions maintained maat and created and sustained all living things.\n\nThe gods were divided between those who created and those who destroyed. The \"destroyers \" were called tyrants, while the \"creators \" controlled Maat, the \"true form of existence \" (Thinking, being, and knowing ).\n\nAll gods ruled with divine justice, and each had their own system of divine punishments and rewards (Thinking).\n\nThe gods and goddesses interacted with and influenced mortals in many different directions. For example, Zeus ruled over the weather, which influenced the way humans lived. The gods could also have sex with mortals and pass on their divine characteristics as divine offspring. This was usually done for the sake of increasing the population of a particular region.\n\nIn the beginning, gods existed only in the realm of thought and created and maintained life on earth ( Being).\n\nOnce the gods became involved in our world, all of their actions were recorded by mankind. Since we are capable of recording and thinking about events, we know that Zeus is the god of Zeus and Zeus is the son of Hera and Poseidon ( Being).\n\nThe gods were first created by the first gods, but then Zeus created many more gods to make his presence felt, including Zeus's half-brother Cronos, who gave Zeus another son named Nemesis. ( being and knowing)\n\nThe gods also had a tendency to use mortals for their own purposes rather than for the good of the world. (Understanding )\n\nBy the end of the first millennium (Understanding), the gods were struggling to maintain cosmic balance and to avoid the destruction of the world by the forces of Chaos. ( Being )\n\nThe first step towards maintaining cosmic balance was to create a balance between the chaos gods and the titans (being). This was done by creating Zeus's grandson Kronos and his sons Zeus' son Agamemnon and Ares. ( Being)\n\nTo protect the world from any potential chaos (being), the gods created a \"perfect order\" called Maat, which they considered to be a reality between the worlds above and below (Understanding).\n\nThe gods would then rule in Maat, and the mortal world below was ruled over by men. This balance between the world of the gods and the mortal world was maintained because the mortal world consisted of beings who were ruled by the gods' principles and rules (Thinking). For instance, the gods themselves observed the laws they created in Maat.\n\nFurthermore, if any violation of these rules took place the gods were required to destroy that world. ( Understanding)\n\nBut some gods were very selfish. They desired more power and more pleasure than they gave humanity. This led to frequent violations of maat (Being). However, the gods and goddesses had an agreement to forgive each other's transgressions (Understanding).\n\nBecause of maat, the gods had absolute power, but also were able to live perfectly free lives. (Understanding)\n\nThe gods, as the rulers of the immortal worlds they were all part of, did not know about the mortal world or how \"mortal\" people lived. (Understanding)\n\nMortals, however, had knowledge of the gods and were very aware of and critical of the gods actions. ( Being ) Therefore, mortal people were wary of and suspicious of Zeus's involvement with mortal women and children.\n\nIn fact, the gods did have a tendency to interfere with the lives of mortals. Whenever a divine child would be born, the gods would interfere and give it to a \"good\" mortal woman. Also, Zeus had the power to create and destroy gods, and so he had a tendency to destroy gods who he did not like.

{"id":4854,"ended":true,"length":648,"text":"Electrification of the Hastings Line was first considered by the SER as early as 1903. Lack of finance meant that no decision had been made by the time World War I broke out in 1914. A second effort was made after the war, with a proposal to electrify the line between Penge and Beckenham Junction using two 6 V DC (120 V AC) units supplied by LNER. But there did not seem to be sufficient funding; the electrification scheme failed to make the final cut for funding, and the line was not electrified until 1964.\n\nThe SER ran into financial difficulties and, along with the LNER, was nationalised in 1948. The electrification scheme did not gain any traction until 1952, when the electrification of London Waterloo and. In 1959, as work to electrify the line between Bexleyheath and Upminster progressed, the route was electrified by a third rail system.\n\nIn 1961, the electrification of Waterloo to Upminster and. The line was re-electrified again in 1964, with more powerful overhead line equipment. Work on the electrification of the line between Bexleyheath or Victoria and West Croydon did not take place until the 1970s. All the work was contracted to LNER and the first new dual-powered EMUs went into service in 1976.\n\nIn 1985, an electrification scheme was mooted for the line between Redhill and South Norwood\/Redhill. In February 1986, the route was converted to a standard gauge and, in April 1987, the first trains ran on the new line. The conversion was complete at Woolwich in December 1986 and the line was re-electrified as a single track between Woolwich and South Norwood\/Redhill in 1988.\n\nFrom 1992, the line was re-opened as a dual-powered (1,500 V DC electric and 1,500 V DC diesel) electrified line. This arrangement was extended in 2000 with the completion of the Victoria to Bexleyheath part-dual-powered scheme and the completion of the Metropolitan line extension to Romford. The full-dual-powered line opened to passengers on 1 December 2000.\n\nVictoria to Bexleyheath is built for 1,500 V DC operation, which allows fast and reliable travel at speeds up to 125 mph (200 kph). However, because of the proximity of the track to houses, platforms must be at an average of 32 feet or 9 meters apart. This is much shorter than those of the rest of London Underground, meaning the use of much smaller trains. The trains have a capacity for 1,500 people, compared to the standard class 300 capacity. Buses are used on the half-dual-powered services between Bexleyheath and Beckenham Junction and Redhill.\n\nFrom late 2003, there were proposals to re-signal the line through the Bexleyheath Tunnel and install more powerful (1,700 V DC) overhead line equipment to allow higher speed services in order to increase the frequency of services. However, these plans have since been dropped and the line remains as it is.\n\nServices are primarily operated by London Underground and Southeastern, which operate as a \"combined franchise\" with a three-year contract from 1 March 2003, ending 31 December 2005, and a three-year extension until 31 December 2009\n\nLondon Underground operates all services from Victoria to Bexleyheath. Between Victoria and Beckenham Junction the services of LNER are operated by Southern on behalf of London Underground, although London Underground provides some non-London connections to the line by contract. Southeastern operates all services from Beckenham Junction to Redhill. There is some overlap of services between the stations on the line, although this is minimised by the way the two operators operate their

{"id":1925,"ended":true,"length":707,"text":"Although sometimes interpreted as the result of a single catastrophe, the Bernissart finds instead are now interpreted as recording multiple events. According to this interpretation, at least three occasions of mortality are considered relevant \u2013 the collapse of Neolithic dwellings at Elmina (modern Ghana), the collapse of a large hut community, and the apparent failure of an entire Bronze-Age settlement.\n\nA hut built by the Elmina community was found to have been abandoned in the ninth century CE\n\nEvidence from the settlement, located in Elmina (modern Ghana), demonstrates a transition into a mixed, if still subsistence, agro-pastoral way of life, and then into a settled way of life in later years. The material suggests that the initial destruction may have been related to a failure to cope with the effects of climate change. The collapse of Elmina was followed by a dramatic retreat towards the sea by a coastal settlement of the later ninth or early tenth century\n\nElmina is the seat of Ghana's most important ancient kingdom, that of Gyea, which flourished from the fourth to the third century BCE. The Kingdom of Gyea was a major power in West Africa for centuries. The Elmina city site and its environs were inhabited throughout the early part of antiquity. It is estimated that the settlement was abandoned in as early as the early ninth century CE, although archaeologists have found evidence that it was abandoned in the late sixth or early fifth centuries. The first major catastrophe is said to have occurred in 563 CE, when a major fire destroyed the majority of Elmina.\n\nA second catastrophe probably occurred in the late seventh century CE, when the site was abandoned.\n\nA third and final catastrophe occurred in the mid- to late ninth century CE\n\nThis destruction suggests either widespread social collapse associated with a change in the climate to severe climatic stress, or a succession of calamities resulting in a general lack of support, and the abandonment of the site of Elmina for the purpose of migration southward into a more hospitable environment. The Elmina collapse parallels the abandonment of many similar settlements along the Atlantic shore in the same region which may be attributable to the collapse of similar coastal settlements.\n\nCultural and political changes in Late Antiquity would in all likelihood have accelerated the abandonment of coastal settlement. An influx of migrating peoples into the fertile lowland areas of Ghana in the fifth century, and a subsequent increase in the agricultural production made coastal regions an increasingly unattractive place of settlement. This may have hastened in a dramatic manner in the late fifth and early sixth centuries. At that time, the Gyea dynasty and several other nearby kingdoms lost the economic edge they had enjoyed after their unification in the fifth century, making their lands less fertile and fertile lands more attractive. The expansion of the Christian Roman Empire, by virtue of its superior military prowess and increased cultural mobility, further stimulated the migration of the local populace into this productive core of the African interior.\n\nAccording to ancient sources, the area around Elmina eventually became known as Accra, the traditional home of the Ashanti kingdom.\n\nThe current consensus view is that these events were the main causes of the collapse, and the Elmina settlement eventually became Gyea, which became the capital of the Kingdom of Gyea. The Ashanti kingdom played a prominent role in the history of Ghana and its neighbours\n\nThe Elmina collapse is very similar to that of the ancient kingdom of Nara in Japan. Elmina represents a type of coastal settlement typical of the ancient world called \"neolithic huts\", while Nara had a highly advanced urban center. The fact these collapses occurred during the same period of time and both took place during a period of climatic change may be seen as a sign of collapse of a culture that is not adapted to climatic change.","token_len":791,"entropy":[8.421,9.7185,0.3603,3.2881,4.1149,0.0078,1.9356,4.8595,8.6656,0.3916,1.5189,11.1414,11.7097,4.1961,9.9594,8.5061,7.6447,7.3668,5.7457,0.4641,11.0272,5.8301,1.6432,1.4942,5.2377,0.0024,2.9864,1.0569,0.225,5.5806,0.916,2.6449,8.0544,2.3386,7.8239,1.9999,5.2165,5.5086,5.5946,1.8468,5.5154,0.0752,8.0756,0.6169,5.9421,3.4225,5.5374,6.6414,0.4663,2.7353,5.6367,8.3548,0.7659,0.4079,2.6102,0.0341,3.2212,3.281,8.9436,6.9533,2.9847,0.3327,0.2833,6.9927,4.5097,0.0915,3.0338,3.0638,8.6531,4.1578,0.276,1.8366,1.3811,1.451,0.0013,3.8955,12.4296,4.7892,1.6625,1.1895,6.4033,0.0067,0.3787,2.152,2.4224,2.6185,1.4101,0.8801,0.9562,3.4731,1.975,1.5546,6.9678,0.1287,3.1052,4.7839,0.0002,5.5384,2.1768,1.2286,5.8237,3.8884,4.3395,0.8528,4.1483,0.0037,0.0025,3.6273,0.2655,0.0579,0.2953,5.2725,3.4925,7.4321,4.4889,1.7016,6.6439,4.541,7.2931,3.3815,7.2117,2.8944,9.4298,3.7263,0.6165,6.8355,1.4983,7.6227,0.2031,0.0641,2.2002,3.0465,6.5431,1.9379,0.8963,6.2841,3.5124,0.1248,0.0694,2.3787,4.0595,2.9468,0.5254,1.44,7.0436,6.417,0.2782,1.0695,6.1187,6.1048,5.164,0.1173,0.548,5.3214,0.0451,2.1486,4.5865,0.918,5.3787,0.1006,0.9753,5.0763,0.016,1.551,0.1032,1.1153,1.818,3.4894,0.1892,3.3943,0.0018,0.001,2.8935,2.8196,0.1748,1.1163,4.7532,3.8662,4.6144,1.3133,4.6627,3.8294,3.0623,5.4978,1.0813,2.6768,1.6316,5.5137,5.8327,5.8486,1.3639,0.1452,1.547,6.6326,0.0002,5.3124,0.0084,0.0029,2.2052,2.4447,5.7518,0.0299,7.8154,0.487,4.2649,1.3912,4.7553,6.8617,1.0083,6.2879,0.4934,5.0033,5.751,5.1374,1.5233,1.4912,5.1674,1.4811,1.7055,3.8926,2.2935,0.205,3.8989,1.1196,2.4886,0.5498,1.4364,5.8006,1.1659,0.2477,0.0056,0.0027,1.2727,3.0311,3.4229,4.4918,0.8202,5.1335,0.1004,2.8306,3.0611,2.3785,1.782,5.343,0.0036,0.0346,4.89,5.3069,4.4996,1.2879,4.6471,0.0034,0.0031,1.4072,4.7384,6.0437,0.7105,3.6956,3.4456,0.0013,8.2375,1.2749,2.8627,1.1704,2.6549,0.0726,1.8009,4.5355,1.5925,3.8266,1.5919,9.3429,2.7768,0.008,1.2629,4.7054,1.8267,0.0206,0.2606,1.8047,3.2679,3.6637,1.1635,3.4172,1.4377,1.6537,1.3901,1.013,2.1194,1.7341,0.8284,2.4338,3.7133,1.5509,0.8825,7.8261,1.1056,1.9895,1.819,4.7287,3.2803,4.6371,4.1698,4.1353,0.057,0.0542,0.2394,1.1821,4.2214,4.4522,1.1876,0.7024,0.7635,1.46,4.1632,3.2629,1.438,0.8252,6.871,0.0044,4.2541,0.0036,0.0069,1.7252,1.4465,0.0002,3.2144,4.0758,1.22,6.9365,0.3486,0.695,2.044,3.2063,2.0167,0.4287,0.5466,0.6063,0.4291,1.4028,5.495,1.8581,2.478,2.261,4.3507,0.0002,2.9064,0.4615,4.525,0.7207,0.4242,1.599,0.4916,0.6188,3.4317,0.3584,5.0721,0.1376,3.0643,0.0555,0.3328,4.3001,0.0002,3.8289,6.2956,5.3425,6.4734,5.9706,5.1934,2.3935,6.5203,0.0109,2.6044,4.3562,0.4944,1.8667,2.7225,5.778,9.5942,3.0688,0.016,5.2058,1.1179,0.2084,1.4575,6.1741,0.0126,5.0745,0.1261,4.5244,1.7615,1.786,4.676,4.2709,0.0041,5.0881,3.5679,3.1939,2.8752,2.8476,0.1139,1.3503,1.5568,3.5577,2.6274,0.0016,0.0007,3.9092,2.2015,2.4329,0.0075,7.4331,6.0323,1.6721,3.1768,3.0962,2.4396,4.8184,0.0003,2.1375,0.3025,1.5446,4.1934,0.0058,0.0062,4.9096,7.6747,0.6636,4.5859,0.123,3.3499,6.4305,2.3858,4.7739,0.1562,4.0472,6.0611,2.7373,0.5639,5.1176,1.994,5.1992,4.0712,3.1023,5.9081,0.1076,1.2409,3.0204,0.0305,7.174,3.8375,0.3377,2.1044,0.8789,0.0002,5.2849,1.6845,2.2718,2.1811,2.568,1.9702,7.7281,0.9457,0.0012,6.198,6.5235,4.123,0.3394,0.2719,5.8893,0.5499,4.3964,0.1533,6.0162,2.9652,2.1022,5.4319,4.3529,0.0292,5.3279,3.4124,2.6731,0.8901,6.56,6.4653,1.7823,2.0174,0.8084,3.4414,3.4092,0.2626,4.1448,0.814,4.9506,1.9225,1.9386,2.8609,3.1788,0.0927,1.3771,4.6362,1.2891,5.6783,4.3059,7.2517,4.5702,3.2979,8.1971,0.0361,1.154,6.1137,1.4192,0.7547,3.0221,3.4543,0.3171,6.4928,0.0113,6.2158,4.2005,5.5761,1.9285,5.0779,0.5506,3.8791,3.2927,2.9232,0.2205,0.9507,0.048,2.7699,5.0056,2.4923,0.1952,0.5876,1.2908,5.6844,0.2165,0.1427,5.3586,3.3932,5.5271,1.1059,6.4149,1.0052,6.239,3.8834,6.123,7.2787,1.4846,0.3814,2.0103,4.397,2.5331,5.2145,1.7775,1.0597,3.4292,0.081,3.6466,4.983,2.7123,4.2071,2.0373,2.9215,0.9684,4.5872,5.7752,1.3377,2.3381,1.9115,1.9375,5.7734,0.0843,1.1511,5.2897,5.9062,0.1865,2.1334,5.0368,6.9413,0.0021,1.7083,6.2289,3.408,3.0838,1.2769,5.6789,4.9041,5.9959,0.3492,4.0326,5.0644,0.7769,2.3646,0.2729,2.3822,5.3821,5.1347,2.5021,4.6654,9.0782,8.3086,0.3718,0.8791,3.3961,6.5329,0.2319,0.7029,0.0002,5.8025,0.0083,6.3252,2.5067,0.2754,0.9767,6.132,1.4594,0.8309,0.001,0.0005,7.1418,0.9644,4.4084,0.0228,8.3682,0.8487,1.2039,2.6363,7.4742,3.6674,0.1265,0.6336,6.0476,3.3169,5.9486,1.203,2.9026,0.0002,1.656,6.264,7.8275,2.4629,1.1761,0.049,4.9984,2.0515,1.4611,2.1239,6.3502,2.0778,0.2033,0.1497,1.4627,3.4921,1.3216,2.2558,5.1432,0.0042,0.0047,4.3991,6.6432,1.6573,6.2858,0.0768,0.0039,1.7368,2.5211,2.933,0.9731,1.5893,0.1459,1.2451,2.6465,0.0814,0.0755,0.0009,0.0007,0.6778,1.529,5.5216,0.0039,1.3589,7.5349,0.4735,3.096,0.2055,0.1197,0.6436,5.3302,0.0652,2.1284,1.7349,2.73,5.3955,4.9767,0.0002,1.5015,4.3925,0.0045,0.0051,1.723,1.7235,5.6736,2.1245,0.1267,2.5872,0.4855,0.635,6.2501,4.494,0.268,4.7885,5.1545,1.627,7.4503,1.3468,6.6959,0.004,0.0042,6.

{"id":3219,"ended":true,"length":742,"text":"Since 2003, Bonds has been a key figure in the Bay Area Laboratory Co @ - @ operative ( BALCO ) scandal. He was under investigation by a federal grand jury regarding his performance - enhancing drug dealings with BALCO founder Victor Conte, a doctor who also faces federal charges. Bonds has claimed innocence and is a staunch supporter of BALCO-trained athlete Barry Bonds and their former doctor. But now Bonds finds himself in an even more difficult situation; the federal investigation against the Giants has gained a significant amount of steam, and the possibility of criminal charges has become more likely by the hour. The US Attorney's office is currently investigating not only Conte and bonds but also Bonds' agents, the SF Giants, Barry Bonds' team - issued Nike sneakers and Bonds' financial records.\n\nOn Thursday October 22, 2005, San Francisco federal court - appointed receiver Fred W. Weisberg appeared before the San Francisco Giants' board of directors, to outline the Giants' progress in the BALCO scandal. Weisberg began his presentation by saying \"I have been working closely with the US attorney's office and we have made substantial progress in my ongoing work to obtain full and speedy payment of all unpaid player and club player salaries \". At this point the SF Giants have paid about one-third of the approximately $50 million owed to the current and former steroid users of the team. Weisberg also stated that the board of directors has not been told to discontinue their efforts as they have been informed that the investigation of the team has moved from its earlier phase of only examining the use of steroids by Bonds, to one that is also examining both Bonds, Conte, and the SF Giants regarding any role they may have in the scandal.\n\nFollowing Weisberg, the chairman of the board of directors, Peter Magowan, said that although the scandal has been \"very embarrassing \", the Giants are doing everything they can to pay what they owe to the players who used steroids, and that they would continue to do so for the time being. Magowan also explained that the board of directors wants the best outcome to come out of this, and that their aim was not to simply \"pay the players as they go along \".\n\nLater during the meeting, the Giants' acting general manager, Wally Backman, was quizzed about whether or not Conte was ever an SF Giants employee. This came after a recent interview on \" CBS Sportsline\" in which Conte stated that he was an advisor to Backman throughout the 1999-2001 seasons. Backman did not reveal any specifics of his relationship with Conte or his role at the company, but did say that he did indeed work with Conte for the first time in 1999.\n\nAfter the meeting, the Giants' board told reporters that although the team was trying to \"make as much progress as possible\" in paying players back, they would not be paying any more money than they currently have. The Giants do this because of the fact that the US Attorney's Office has not indicated they feel they have done enough already, and are still in the middle of the investigation.\n\nFederal law requires that all US citizens, companies, organizations and governments be held accountable for all the crimes that have been committed by people which they are party to.

{"id":412,"ended":true,"length":730,"text":"Civilian Public Service men lived in barracks @ - @ style camps, such as former Civilian Conservation Corps facilities. The camps served as a base of operations, from which the COs departed each day [ on the bus ], returning to private homes after a work day.\n\nCamps were designed by civilian architects and staffed by civilian personnel who had no direct experience with the specific operation of Army units. Civilian architects tended to be relatively inexperienced compared to military architects, and not often experienced with the specific mission for which the COs were employed.\n\nThe best known of these camps was the Civilian Public Service camp at Manzanar, California. The camp was established in 1943 by the United States War Department to provide jobs for the approximately 10,000 Chinese American and Japanese American civilians incarcerated as \"enemy aliens\" as a result of the Executive Order 9066 of February 19, 1942.\n\nPrior to this period, most COs served as members of Army units in combat or non-combat positions that were in the areas of military support, training and transportation. However, in World War I and World War II they sometimes served with combat units. As part of a broader post-war civilian relief effort and to ease the burden on Army bases in the inter-war period, COs were asked to design and construct temporary, low-cost facilities as part of their employment.\n\nHistorians estimate that around 3,000 COs were employed at these camps. However, as the facilities were temporary in nature they were not intended to be permanent and could be dismantled at the conclusion of the war. Since the camps needed to be completed quickly and could not be allowed to decay after the war, they were usually constructed simply in a variety of designs. The COs would have been responsible for constructing the buildings on their own labor, but most of this work was simply the execution of designs left to them from civilian designers.\n\nThe typical CO camp would have consisted of a large group of barracks, with individual barracks on two or more levels, each sleeping six to eight people. Each barracks could be constructed with steel, pre-fabricated wall blocks. This meant that in the short term barracks could be more easily erected than if they had been designed and built on site.\n\nEach barracks was provided with its own latrine and shower and typically each room contained four beds. Although men would occupy each room, with each person sleeping at their own individual bunk, COs sometimes shared bathrooms and showers which were located in the center of the camp. This may have involved a small area of ground which contained a concrete slab or similar surface. At Manzanar, for example, this center contained both a shower and the head of the latrine. Other types of bathrooms may have also existed. In some camps there may have been a separate \"camp building\" which contained toilets, showers, drinking water, cooking facilities and general office work.\n\nEach camp may have had an indoor basketball court and a swimming pool. The camp at Manzanar was an extensive work camp, with COs there performing a variety of tasks. At the Manzanar camp, the principal tasks were construction, maintenance, repair and general administrative duties. The Manzanar camp was the most extensive camp which received COs from World War II.\n\nThe purpose of these facilities was to provide temporary housing to a small, mobile group of Japanese Americans and Chinese and to provide a place where they could work in low skilled jobs. While not always permanent, they were constructed relatively inexpensively and the COs spent most of their time on other tasks. These projects were intended to relieve pressure on Army installations and to give the civilian population a taste of civilian life and the comforts of home. The overall goal was to make some sort of home while the men were incarcerated. This was one of the great failures of the American experience during World War

{"id":2712,"ended":true,"length":659,"text":"The terminus of the Rother Navigation was on a side stream, at the southern edge of Midhurst.

{"id":3581,"ended":true,"length":596,"text":"In 2002 the Czerkases published a volume through their Dinosaur Museum titled Feathered Dinosaurs and the Origin of Flight. In this journal they described and named several species. Of the six species named, one \u2013 the \u2018Protosuchus brevirostris\u2019 \u2013 turned out to have a very, very interesting story.\n\nThis species, while having many of the traits of the \u2018Protosuchus\u2019 of the Czerkas \u2013 a long neck, short tail, a large, powerful thigh, and a single claw \u2013 differed in a number of ways.\n\nIts thigh bone \u2013 the tibia \u2013 was relatively narrow, and only two-thirds of the width of the more commonly observed \u2018Protosuchus\u2019. In addition, its shoulder joint was very short, as it would be in today\u2019s birds, but its shoulder bones were very large, a typical condition of theropods that also indicates that the shoulder was much further back on its body than in most reptiles. These differences were also found in all six closely related birds that also had very bird-like shoulder joints.\n\nHowever, these features are not necessarily sufficient to have created a separate lineage for bird origins. Indeed, if the shoulder was as far back as it is in birds, the creature would be far too large to have evolved into birds. A similar size would also mean that it would have been far more robust than birds, with bones that could not have evolved in such a way.\n\nTo better understand what this animal was, many of the other dinosaur fossils of its type from around the world were examined and compared. Some characteristics were considered especially useful by the Czerkas as these would often be preserved by the way fossilizations would occur.\n\nThis fossil was found in the Lianxin Formation in the Ordos Basin in China. Its body was found to have a number of features that can only be explained by the presence of feathers around the area where its limbs would support the body weight. The most obvious were a small row along the top and bottom of the limb, feathers that extended downwards as far as the elbow, and the presence of one plumular on the inner thigh near its center.\n\nThis means that while the shoulder could be relatively bird-like, it actually couldn\u2019t be very far back. If it had been as far back as it is in birds, then the bone would have been well above the ankle and it would have had the bones and structure of both a much larger, more robust animal, and one which was also far larger than birds.\n\nThese differences, found in all six bird-like dinosaurs compared, together with many other features suggest that the Czerkas\u2019 \u2018Protosuchus\u2019 is a more accurate group name than \u2018Protosuchus\u2019.\n\nReferences:\n\nCzerkas, R. and Czerkas, N. 2002. \u201cTheropods and ornithuromorphs with \u2018bird-like\u2019 shoulder girdles in a feathered theropod\u201d.

{"id":4196,"ended":true,"length":690,"text":"Fossett tried six times over seven years for the first solo balloon circumnavigation. His fifth attempt cost him $ 1 @. @ 25 million of his own money ; his sixth and successful attempt took place on March 30-31, 1933, with a much improved airship, the Airship America. It was the largest, heaviest, and fastest hydrogen-filled, solid-air balloon then built. ( ) (Wikipedia)\n\nThe Airship America was the world's largest rigid airship at the time, and it helped to define the nature and limits of these machines into the Second Century of Flight and beyond. In 1933, it was launched from Fort Tuthill, Kansas, and quickly established an overall speed record of 180 mph (290 km\/h), and was the first to navigate on hydrogen as its only propellant. However, shortly thereafter on April 12, a gash in the hydrogen tank led to a loss of control, and the balloon drifted into a field in the middle of Kansas.\n\nDespite the loss of the hydrogen engine and engine propellers, the balloon remained airborne for an hour and a half before crashing in a field near the Kansas-Missouri border. No one was injured, but the $1 million Airship America burned down in a few hot hours; however, this loss was the impetus behind the development of many features which would make rigid airships less prone to catastrophic loss.\n\nIn April 1934, at another major event in the history of airship technology, the hydrogen-based Airship America II was launched from Fort Tuthill. However, this time the Airship America II was not recovered. When the hydrogen tank containing the upper helium envelope burst, the loss of helium from the remainder of the hydrogen envelope triggered a deflation of the hydrogen envelope, which was rapidly followed by deflation of most of the hydrogen envelope. Despite some minor repairs, the gas tanks were punctured as the balloon fell back to earth. After the failure of the Airship America II of the hydrogen engine, the gas-filled gas bag was used as the only rigid part of the airship, and is likely the reason that the Airship America II remained airborne for as long as it did.\n\nFossett made history again on September 26 through 27, 1939, with the launch of the Airship America III, the last of the four-motor (gas-filled) American models. The original press release from 1939 announced a flight duration of 4 days and 5 nights, an expected height reached of 100,000 feet and a speed of 45 mph (72 km\/h). The last-ever hydrogen-filled Airship America flew for 18 hours and 45 minutes. In the post-World War II era, when the concept of rigid airship propulsion was abandoned, the aircraft continued to remain in constant \"flying\" status by means of the large-scale helium filling of each of its enormous chambers.\n\nFossett's last flight in this world was in 1944 and ended tragically and tragically. He was killed in a plane crash when his airplane took off from Santa Ana, California. At the crash site, they discovered the wreckage of many of his hydrogen-filled airships, including the last one he built, and the two-day-old egg-shaped hydrogen airship prototype. Fossett's body was airlifted to his estate in Pasadena, California. All three were then recovered intact and buried with full military honors at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

{"id":4602,"ended":true,"length":741,"text":"There are three primary modes of application of NVC : Self @ - @ empathy involves compassionately connecting with what is going on inside us. This may involve, without blame, noticing the feelings that arise on the inside when we have an experience of a person or group. Sometimes, the feelings are painful, and we try to avoid these feelings. We then experience another feeling, which can be of interest (a warm feeling), or possibly of frustration. The difference between these two feelings is the role we are playing, whether we are being, or are not being.\n\nAt this point, if we are not being, feeling of frustration can occur because we are acting as a person who is not being. To avoid being, we act as though there are important things we are supposed to be doing. With all those acts of being, we create self -imposed boundaries, as a way of saying that we are a \" person \".\n\nSelf- @ - @ empathy is an active process, and is not in itself a source of suffering. Once we have been self- @ - @ empathetic with ourselves, then we can begin to become empathetic or compassionate for others.\n\nSelf and Others @ empathy is where we act empathetically, as a person who is self. Our empathic connection is with both ourselves and with other people. We can be empathetic toward ourselves as individuals, or as part of the self - @ - @ group that contains all of our individual selves.\n\nSelf and Others Empathy is being able to connect with the other in ways that are healthy and empathic. This is both for the person and for the other. We may be empathic toward others in order to get closer to them, or to help them in some way. They may be attracted by our empathic connection. We may have empathy toward others in order to help them understand themselves better.\n\nThis can be achieved either through observation, through the act of listening or of asking questions, or through our actions.\n\nWhen we empathically connect with others, we know what to do when something is happening to them. This involves being in the same space with another person, understanding who they are at the moment. This allows us to empathically participate in their lives.\n\nSelf and others empathy requires that we are willing to put ourselves in the other's shoes. It requires that we can see what it is like to be that other person, without any filters which limit us or keep us from seeing the object of our empathical interest in a more natural way.\n\nIt is helpful to remember that we can have empathy for one or many individuals at once. In the latter case, we have a limited capacity to be empathic, because we can only be fully empathic with each individual in turn. So, by being empathic with a group, the capacity to be empathic with one person is expanded.\n\nPeople who do this can gain a deeper and clearer understanding of what is happening in the lives of all members of the group, in order to better take part. At the same time, they can also deepen their understandings of themselves as individuals.\n\nWhen we are empathic or compassionate with others, we may gain a greater understanding of what is happening in our own lives and why. In being empathic, we open ourselves to experiencing the world from the outside, and from a more natural point of view. Being empathetic with others can enable us to be more understanding of others, because we will have a \" sense \" of what it is to have those same characteristics.\n\nSelf and others empathy enables us to understand the world around us, and to understand the actions of ourselves and of the world.

{"id":3379,"ended":true,"length":701,"text":"The land on which Denmark Street lies was formerly part of the grounds for St Giles Hospital, founded as a house for lepers in the early 12th century by Henry I's wife, Eleanor of Provence. Eleanor, it is said, was so horrified by the cruelty of the lepers that, together with her sister, Matilda of Castile, she founded a hospital dedicated to \"the soul of Saint Giles\" for those suffering from the leper's malady.\n\nThe hospital, however, was soon dissolved and, in the 1510s, Henry VIII and Elizabeth granted a land and castle to Robert Dudley, 3rd Earl of Leicester, as a place for his private residences. Later, when Leicester built a new home, he turned St Giles and his lands over to Thomas Cromwell as security. After the defeat of Cromwell at the Battle of Edgehill in 1545, most of Dudley's castle remained in Cromwell's hands but he did hand over the hospital, and its land and remaining lands, to Sir William Russell, who in 1552 conveyed them all to his son, Henry. On his father's death, however, Henry had to wait until 1564 to take possession of the lands. At this time the hospital was still providing care for lepers.\n\nA major renovation of St Giles hospital in 1722\u201324 removed all the buildings except a shell of six large buildings at ground level, the original hospital chapel and a small outbuilding on the site of the present St Giles'vicarage. The hospital also became known as the Leicester Leprosy Hospital.\n\nDuring the second and third-quarter of the 18th century the site passed from manor to manor. Around 1773 the vicarage, erected in 1743-47 on the site of the earlier hospital, was made into a small manor house. It gradually grew until it was sold to Sir Edward Smith, Bart., who, in 1802, was persuaded of its value as a residence. At this point Sir Edward's son, Sir John Smith, Sir William Smith's grandson, Sir Benjamin Smith, Sir Andrew Smith, Sir Henry Smith, Bart., and Thomas Smith, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury, took over the management of the land and the vicarage and, in time, converted the house into an extensive hotel. This came to be known as The St Giles and the Hotel passed, first to the Duke of Grafton, and then to the Cavendish and Shelburne families, who in 1860 added an elegant ballroom to the existing building.\n\nAt some point during the 19th century St Giles's house became the centre of the St Giles Club, which rented the estate for a monthly fee. In 1888 the St Giles Hotel became a three-star hotel under the management of the St Giles Club.\n\nSt Giles was bought by the Smith-Bulkeley-Savage family in 1933 and in the 1950s Sir Edward and Lady Smith opened a tennis centre. Sir Edward Smith died in 1957, but his brother, Arthur Smith, survived him until 1970. After Arthur Smith's death (in 1963 ) his son Edward Smith succeeded him as Lord St Giles. When the hotel was requisitioned as a \"motorhome\" depot in the Second World War, Lady Smith was able to open a small hotel in the grounds. During the war and afterwards The St Giles was also used by the British Museum as their motorhome depot and the old leper's hospital was converted into a museum in 1968. Nowadays the Smith-Bulkeley-Savage family own the surrounding grounds of the St Giles estate.\n\nThe present hotel and grounds of St Giles are owned by the Crown Estate. There is some ongoing restoration work in the grounds and the 1822 chapel building, with a large open terrace and an oak-lined room, remains an important feature of the

{"id":3602,"ended":false,"length":700,"text":"The genus name, Salvia, was first used by Pliny for a plant that was likely Salvia officinalis ( common sage ) and is derived from the Latin < unk >. The specific epithet idesia is from the Greek < idesias >, meaning \"well-tempered \".\n\nSalvia is a genus belonging to section Salviae, the common sage family. Salvia sanguinolenta is grown for the ornamental garden primarily for its yellow-green leaves and for its small, fragrant flowers, which are produced in early spring. The plant has aromatic leaves, and can be harvested once a year.\n\nContents\n\nSalvia sanguinolenta has a long green, thin, slender, often slightly branched twig or branch.[1] It produces yellow flowers in early spring; in parts of the Great Lakes region, flowers can be seen as early as March. The yellow flowers are also used as a food or flavoring in the production of marmalade or jam.[1]\n\nOn the plant, the leaf veins are narrow and parallel to one another, with long straight hairs on the margins or edge of the leaf.[1] The leaves are held upright and have long slender, tapered, or curved tips.[1] The leaves are usually up to 6 cm (2.4 in) long and 1 cm (0.4 in) wide at their broadest points.[1] The leaves are generally elliptic, with long tapering tips.[1] There are three to five sets of veins on each leaf.[1] The margins of the leaves are often sharp and the leaf spine ( a modified peduncle ) is usually prominent.[1] The flowers are yellow with a narrow petals, and the flowers are arranged in a flat, cylindrical panicle. Flowers are produced in the first half of May.[1]\n\nSalvia sanguinolenta bears numerous small, yellow, fragrant flowers with pink bases on short, spreading stems which are usually less than 20 cm (7.9 in) tall.[1] The panicle is about 3 cm (1.1 in) above the ground,[1] and may have 3 to 19 flowers per panicle.[1] Flowers are generally arranged at the upper third of the stem, and may be very small or very large.[1] The flowers usually have five stamens at their base, and a perianth,[1] made up of an upper lobe and a lower lobe.[1]\n\nThe small yellow flowers of Salvia sanguinolenta are produced in early spring. Flowers bloom for 2 to 2 weeks.[1] The plant bears only one flower per plant, however; the plants are also infertile.[1]\n\nThe plant can be harvested only once a year between the weeks of mid-May and mid-May.[1] The plant has an average height of 0.6 m (2 ft 4 in) and it reaches a length of 1.6 m (5 ft 10 in).[1]\n\nThe plant bears bright green, sometimes variegated, leaves (or \"sage leaves\") in mid-summer to early fall. Leaves are 3\u20136 cm long, and are alternate or opposite, and grow from wood. Leaves are aromatic and, due to their small, serrated edges, are commonly used and appreciated by aromatherapists as tools in scent blends.[2] Leaves are also used in traditional Chinese medicines.[2]\n\nSalvia sanguinolenta has a long lasting scent, which is often perceived as an herbaceous or flowery fragrance by the human senses.[2] Because the plant's scent lasts for several hours, it is commonly used for aromatherapy, and blends of sage and lavender are a common gift to house and office workers.[2]","token_len":795,"entropy":[11.4236,4.174,2.9859,7.2629,2.5503,2.7242,2.4821,2.1077,1.955,1.3448,7.1788,0.3091,4.5399,2.4585,6.0446,2.2901,1.5793,6.7878,8.0628,0.667,3.3688,0.0263,0.0036,2.1054,12.3329,8.5649,3.4797,1.6163,3.4362,4.7023,0.0318,0.6926,2.1145,9.7197,10.7916,7.7314,4.5142,1.8323,1.8231,7.536,5.8851,0.0135,7.4018,6.867,6.4069,2.0801,4.6524,0.9851,1.3114,2.2701,2.5117,0.3507,4.1742,0.1412,1.6098,2.2681,0.7816,5.7624,0.9703,7.0871,0.0114,8.3095,1.812,0.0596,3.6522,0.117,2.6815,1.4636,3.8653,5.9839,0.0402,11.9937,5.9921,0.719,8.2202,1.5867,2.9169,3.9444,2.7736,3.4227,0.9727,2.3632,0.0292,5.9108,3.0729,1.8496,4.5898,12.9221,1.0616,6.7714,3.4087,2.26,3.6377,0.0189,4.3438,10.5785,1.912,1.324,5.9972,2.8977,0.8127,1.6954,1.3578,3.5391,0.9264,5.2183,1.8482,4.2577,0.0047,0.8016,2.2592,1.908,0.7406,5.3039,1.7257,5.0035,1.3508,1.128,1.8426,3.3834,2.627,8.1149,2.6732,1.6986,2.8265,4.0393,0.5633,3.442,6.4726,0.8094,0.2976,1.017,1.3547,0.0002,5.9088,5.1835,0.0002,3.9528,0.0191,2.0892,0.0028,0.0514,0.0772,0.0377,3.6845,1.2831,2.5981,5.7127,2.2423,5.1733,1.3048,4.4926,2.0714,6.9095,5.4829,5.6421,0.2127,0.0002,7.0908,0.5317,4.049,4.1975,8.2525,0.7154,0.0974,1.187,4.2615,4.0748,1.7814,2.0696,2.193,0.7112,3.7033,2.6701,9.2436,0.8772,0.817,7.1245,2.4185,1.5424,0.7834,5.4169,2.6823,0.6108,1.8101,3.7345,1.014,0.066,2.9546,1.6716,1.8345,4.5943,0.8968,0.9915,3.8877,2.9012,1.1724,1.5056,4.2489,4.2969,4.8166,0.0769,1.482,2.1992,5.2083,0.0164,7.1981,1.9441,0.038,3.4112,6.0828,1.8574,1.489,0.0733,0.7347,0.0001,5.8071,1.329,4.5289,1.0806,1.2096,4.0416,4.6416,0.9392,5.019,0.9484,6.1699,0.6879,3.686,0.0143,0.8087,2.4982,4.5861,6.193,5.2203,2.0402,0.6706,6.0029,5.189,5.5267,0.8604,0.1813,1.7798,3.4719,0.6232,0.0441,1.105,1.6365,0.6201,6.3376,4.8442,2.7592,3.5884,2.7489,4.524,1.7303,7.0716,0.0011,2.0017,4.1896,4.6499,2.5855,3.1809,0.2585,0.0287,1.1401,1.2447,0.7362,3.7888,7.1422,0.0516,3.613,2.8176,2.5147,2.0568,1.8635,2.4208,0.7229,0.1764,0.4219,1.3671,3.5979,0.9522,0.0222,2.372,0.0047,2.4098,0.0181,0.0246,0.6134,3.2735,3.5655,6.5408,2.2778,3.5594,1.3843,0.1378,0.0279,1.2376,1.054,0.6407,4.6237,7.4329,3.2339,1.0811,1.5054,2.9317,7.0659,0.1142,2.5928,2.8261,0.0788,0.0152,4.7514,0.5896,3.1227,3.7579,1.5101,6.3387,0.0719,4.4781,2.1056,0.9631,0.8661,2.8691,0.0536,0.0242,1.2743,7.551,0.6595,0.2842,1.0614,0.3946,3.5023,6.3891,1.2727,4.2367,4.5121,7.5843,6.2375,9.1135,8.3795,6.0858,0.362,0.7257,0.5224,3.3818,6.9874,1.0468,0.0401,0.0177,1.2197,4.0301,0.6568,3.7355,3.0125,1.2377,6.265,5.9403,1.4803,1.6185,1.4498,1.9357,2.2826,0.7733,6.1757,0.7715,1.0653,4.9794,1.1062,4.7622,0.0001,0.0016,10.3373,7.2874,1.3919,4.8347,1.006,5.1734,0.9556,2.1922,3.6539,2.1678,0.0273,2.9181,3.0229,0.0371,0.0253,0.6631,0.0002,1.9715,0.017,0.8827,0.0015,0.0159,0.0189,0.0229,6.9461,4.9161,4.017,1.2511,3.4993,1.7344,5.4674,0.0081,1.0436,3.3358,4.4152,10.3393,3.414,5.9775,0.9576,8.858,1.943,5.3142,0.9543,3.2514,5.5545,0.4518,4.5644,0.3222,0.2442,3.7344,1.2813,2.6829,0.0398,0.3376,3.6971,1.1921,0.0678,0.0337,0.9866,11.7474,1.4256,0.9744,3.5567,2.4068,0.5948,0.1416,1.0039,0.1293,2.7717,0.046,0.0356,7.146,0.1457,4.3042,4.6491,0.1416,0.0235,0.592,5.4694,2.5895,5.3503,1.9409,8.5343,4.1211,2.1252,2.4241,0.0803,1.3883,0.0261,0.0213,4.6441,0.8387,4.3415,5.8601,3.9552,0.6734,5.5693,6.2288,0.0919,0.2114,2.798,1.0834,1.3332,3.0836,0.7305,4.6134,3.1815,2.1271,1.9952,0.4083,1.1717,0.0198,0.026,1.3243,1.966,4.7401,1.3018,6.1776,5.9213,2.4727,0.0093,3.7001,1.8809,2.1185,0.8193,0.9844,3.5692,6.1522,7.6618,1.3958,7.6332,0.0447,0.0207,8.3156,2.4254,0.0409,4.7433,4.7659,6.4592,1.8004,0.6162,0.1929,0.0818,1.9809,0.0226,0.0176,1.124,0.0002,1.4049,6.0196,4.0888,0.6128,3.1659,0.9776,0.0037,0.5756,0.0014,0.0013,0.0048,0.0146,0.5007,3.7913,1.2287,2.8964,0.8647,1.909,4.0146,5.837,4.3765,3.5594,0.4021,4.0649,2.3317,4.4838,0.0335,0.0257,1.2759,3.1462,6.539,5.362,2.0259,3.5662,0.767,2.2355,1.0491,5.2847,3.4675,1.6336,4.5357,1.4201,4.6031,6.6348,0.6509,0.0039,2.1867,0.0337,0.0193,1.08,0.0001,1.5427,2.7754,3.077,0.6684,1.7493,4.3082,0.9421,0.1733,0.0272,7.6547,2.1656,5.1781,0.3167,5.7246,0.3575,2.1591,0.3245,1.116,0.0032,4.0585,1.3901,0.0316,0.0278,1.6146,1.229,2.3686,3.345,2.5905,3.9771,0.0709,4.8441,0.0397,2.835,0.7571,0.1017,2.6035,2.3984,3.7666,0.0388,0.7246,0.6369,4.5356,5.8278,1.3209,4.0148,0.0298,2.6918,0.3034,2.3442,0.0668,0.0334,2.5011,0.0686,2.895,0.0451,1.3051,0.0391,0.0138,1.0029,0.0002,1.62,1.6575,5.6202,6.6936,2.5824,1.9438,4.9337,8.4677,0.0366,0.0049,1.7054,1.9998,4.485,4.389,4.0557,3.4462,5.0458,3.2141,0.7787,2.8146,4.3777,0.2672,2.5727,0.0012,4.8738,1.6685,2.9003,1.1659,3.202,0.7902,6.3257,4.2098,1.9218,0.4942,1.3788,1.3646,1.0815,1.6092,10.8593,4.5608,8.1559,4.2135,2.7478,5.3557,2.9453,8.5004,4.3308,2.1877,0.6957,7.6165,1.1982,6.2413,5.1714,0.0063,0.6958,3.6077,3.0249,8.7936,0.0392,2.1609,0.0729,1.4016,5.1162,1.1754,6.7346,5.6784,1.5153,7.7812,0.1678,3.0304,0.1287,2.5476,8.8489,2.6673,6.9536,8.731,0.4688,3.3799,0.049,2.7207,0.7387,2.6904,1.0707,1.4176,6.4038,4.1

reduced.","token_len":795,"entropy":[8.2332,2.7167,6.3382,3.9722,4.0992,0.3666,0.972,6.5486,0.2482,0.1963,4.7903,4.5674,0.0497,2.3024,0.1537,1.2474,5.0142,0.9882,2.3869,3.3989,5.6024,0.0249,6.2849,5.6486,0.0844,0.0509,0.8632,0.9603,7.4084,0.0166,7.8582,10.0032,7.2468,7.5923,1.06,1.191,8.658,9.7887,6.7137,3.511,7.8297,5.1618,0.4407,1.4249,0.1539,4.8762,1.8257,0.2175,0.0048,2.2084,1.5992,0.3979,6.0425,4.2894,0.8156,1.3497,2.8473,3.0966,4.5186,1.5786,1.566,5.1915,5.6517,2.3442,0.2861,1.7486,1.5388,1.0833,0.4366,2.1047,2.543,6.3108,4.9337,2.1975,1.4517,2.0114,3.7445,0.6228,0.1275,5.9351,5.4958,0.6753,3.0586,8.9882,0.8139,0.4068,6.6678,3.6762,7.0153,4.5416,4.0218,0.6322,3.8539,4.2888,3.5377,5.588,0.0034,3.0195,4.6065,2.4348,0.4496,3.0996,0.475,2.968,0.6457,5.6316,2.3863,2.6922,2.3152,4.7834,6.4573,3.2998,3.8247,0.0649,0.3154,0.1468,2.4826,10.2179,2.107,2.7885,1.1097,1.2967,3.5001,4.3388,4.2332,6.1312,5.2758,1.1848,1.4398,3.7118,2.8028,5.6446,4.9439,3.116,9.6006,3.527,5.2824,0.5238,2.3087,2.5929,0.1317,5.7358,1.3905,4.9618,1.1312,2.4273,0.1586,6.0625,1.6002,0.0253,1.996,7.0173,1.297,2.2654,2.2637,5.2948,6.1081,0.1807,1.5217,9.2743,2.9104,0.3568,5.4994,6.5919,1.8444,8.2407,7.3105,0.0441,1.4781,5.6978,3.0457,2.6982,0.9139,1.3886,7.7358,1.8106,6.7405,0.934,3.2311,7.5055,1.4644,5.3475,0.2293,5.9113,7.4053,0.702,5.1122,4.0304,3.8439,4.1088,2.9047,5.0838,0.0156,0.6836,0.9283,1.5516,3.7312,4.2056,0.1758,3.6738,1.6141,6.1001,0.0757,4.22,1.532,0.1508,3.3153,1.8827,1.0733,1.3196,2.3596,4.6602,3.0201,0.9348,4.8086,0.5093,1.4582,3.1817,7.9779,0.7455,0.695,6.5047,10.6571,0.3262,0.0111,2.5673,3.1467,3.4171,0.6413,1.8282,3.7295,1.8681,2.1826,1.8566,2.7268,3.3387,0.6919,5.274,1.3862,4.7924,1.1387,3.697,5.2047,3.2212,7.0185,0.101,3.4671,3.0955,6.0821,0.8172,2.1122,1.9957,4.6474,2.1011,2.8508,1.8646,4.1597,0.9559,0.5983,7.1572,4.2508,5.957,1.2533,0.6349,2.2642,3.1866,4.7385,1.3077,0.2838,1.8353,0.3434,6.1196,3.5046,1.3194,1.8399,4.5368,0.6157,0.012,3.0805,3.5848,0.6616,2.3051,2.2553,5.164,0.1544,0.0138,1.1327,4.9357,1.0225,0.0002,0.0156,0.0168,2.0003,0.0291,0.003,0.001,8.1263,2.257,2.1464,1.9577,5.8989,0.0352,0.3232,4.0145,3.4577,4.931,1.8422,4.9436,1.5257,1.9918,7.5199,0.6142,0.0427,2.0457,1.8208,4.3642,2.0117,1.0519,4.0737,6.5601,0.033,4.6733,0.4615,3.9981,0.0582,4.3249,2.4403,2.3348,4.0056,0.3208,1.8874,6.438,3.5164,0.2308,1.0134,0.037,0.9586,6.7429,0.3155,0.9704,4.2059,4.5361,5.5075,1.1764,1.9881,3.521,0.445,0.6155,0.0233,1.0737,5.1764,0.3704,0.9092,0.0407,0.2597,1.6369,0.1877,2.9023,1.2858,4.8879,2.4522,3.8048,1.3888,0.2294,2.7934,1.3117,0.533,4.8212,0.1591,3.6464,6.1317,3.0095,0.1818,2.1478,3.1795,0.6773,3.6822,4.9493,0.167,5.7826,0.4595,3.7353,0.1405,1.233,2.8732,2.1378,0.5484,1.377,3.21,0.716,2.9044,2.7832,2.717,0.3415,3.9734,0.3997,0.4008,4.1207,3.426,2.3278,0.5343,0.2921,0.0792,0.296,0.3228,0.0007,0.0012,0.0397,0.0206,0.0011,0.0022,0.0016,0.0316,0.219,0.0005,0.001,0.0298,0.0083,0.0056,0.0102,0.0002,0.0012,0.0142,0.0459,0.0349,0.1808,0.0004,0.408,0.3345,0.1031,0.0098,0.0002,0.0569,0.1653,0.0401,0.0012,0.1871,0.0008,0.0046,0.0023,0.0016,0.0014,0.0017,0.005,0.0095,0.0004,0.0264,0.0172,0.0014,0.0094,0.0112,0.0021,0.0,0.0013,0.0009,0.0015,0.004,0.0011,0.0481,0.0111,0.0039,0.0004,0.0008,0.0007,0.0019,0.0134,0.0015,0.0026,0.0012,0.0026,0.0023,0.0003,0.0167,0.0033,0.0023,0.0008,0.0024,0.0005,0.0004,0.0005,0.0026,0.0014,0.0004,1.25,0.1614,0.7845,1.6601,0.0022,0.0006,0.0044,0.0058,0.0145,0.0025,0.0008,0.0015,0.0047,0.0077,0.0003,0.0004,0.0003,0.0003,0.0017,0.0031,0.003,0.0004,0.0005,0.001,0.0006,0.0019,0.002,0.0004,0.0003,0.0005,0.0015,0.0009,0.0091,0.0151,0.0054,0.0011,0.0025,0.0059,0.0004,0.0042,0.0009,0.0038,0.0002,0.2584,0.0139,0.005,0.0019,0.0019,1.8405,0.0015,0.0348,0.002,0.0041,0.0028,0.0009,0.0585,0.0015,0.0004,0.0003,0.0039,0.001,0.0028,0.0024,0.0001,0.0009,0.0004,0.0008,0.0035,0.0027,0.0044,0.0052,0.0033,0.2685,0.0039,0.0533,0.0164,0.0042,0.0006,0.001,0.0008,0.0028,0.0043,0.0007,0.0005,0.0031,0.0097,0.0011,0.0009,0.0125,0.0051,0.0016,0.0006,0.0014,0.003,0.0073,0.0005,0.0003,0.0016,0.0037,0.0019,0.0013,0.0009,0.0023,0.0092,0.0007,0.0036,0.0001,0.0039,0.0004,0.0038,0.0061,0.0029,0.0002,0.0003,0.0231,0.0002,0.0023,0.0049,0.0029,0.0001,0.0066,0.0008,0.0013,0.0011,0.0005,0.003,0.0019,0.0041,0.0006,0.0022,0.0015,0.0054,0.0983,0.0018,0.0023,0.0037,0.0043,0.0009,0.0052,0.0011,0.0021,0.0026,0.0007,0.002,0.003,0.0017,0.0009,0.0029,0.0008,0.0067,0.0028,0.0103,0.0023,0.0912,0.0006,0.0059,0.0009,0.0037,0.0058,0.0009,0.0006,0.0046,0.0027,0.0055,0.0017,0.0116,0.0009,0.0029,0.0012,0.0015,0.0014,0.0049,0.0007,0.041,0.004,0.0092,0.0009,0.0017,0.0024,0.0024,0.0003,0.0009,0.0008,0.0013,0.0006,0.0003,0.0037,0.0029,0.0004,0.0006,0.0002,0.0002,0.0045,0.0076,0.0007,0.0008,0.0004,0.0012,0.0023,0.0003,0.0041,0.0031,0.001,0.0037,0.0015,0.0026,0.0012,0.0068,0.0005,0.002,0.3668,0.1694,0.0139,0.0801,0.4358,0.0007,0.0008,0.0028,0.0003,0.0008,0.003,0.0066,0.0013,0.0008,0.001,0.0004,0.0077,0.0003,0.0017,0.0014,0.002,0.0047,0.0058,0.0024,0.0002,0.0016,0.

{"id":2880,"ended":true,"length":732,"text":"Plaintiff Ely S. Parker went on to become a member of General Ulysses S. Grant's staff during the American Civil War, drawing up the terms of the surrender at Appomattox Court House.\n\nThe book is a collection of letters written during the First World War by Colonel Ely S. Parker, a member of Grant's staff during the war in Europe. Several of these letters were used in the movie Letters From Iwo Jima (1996), directed by Clint Eastwood, and Parker's name was fictionalized in the movie as \"Norman M. Smith.\"\n\nContents\n\nParker's letters are dated from December 1917 through October 1918. During this time, he had attained the rank of colonel but was wounded by shrapnel in March and was promoted to brigadier general to recover from this wound. Parker was one of Grant's leading staff members during the war and was responsible for the surrender of the Germans in May 1918, which is recounted in much detail in the book.\n\nParker's mother died when he was very young, so he was cared for by his grandmother, Maud Parker. He was a good student, however, and his good nature and intelligence were appreciated by teachers and his superiors. In the letters, Parker discusses subjects like how much his mother missed him, the lack of electricity in his town in rural Kentucky, his love of books, and baseball.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Mississippi in June 1865, Parker began a law practice in Columbus Arkansas. While there, he decided to accept a post in Grant's staff and served with the general from August to October 1865 at Vicksburg, then served in the General's Secretariat until January 1866. He was then transferred to Washington and served as a clerk for General Sherman.\n\nParker also began to write letters, many of which were to his grandmother. His early letters are written mostly to talk about his daily life. After the war, the letters become less personal and more political, though they are mostly well-written. Parker frequently discusses political leaders and newspapers.\n\nIn February 1871, he resigned his position at the Secretariat. The reasons which led to his resignation are not completely clear. There are two known possible causes. One was General Grant's desire to return to his private practice and the other was the death of General George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn and the resulting attention on Grant. Parker was not part of the Little Bighorn campaign, but he did remain very close to General Custer. He stayed with the general and his wife at their cabin on Little Bighorn for months after the battle, making detailed notes and keeping the records. On August 1871, the day that the army was told to disperse, Parker boarded the train back to Little Bighorn, but the other men in his cabin did not join him. It is unclear if they did not wish to get on this train or if they were arrested. Parker had stayed on a little longer than all his other friends. Parker also left a notebook of details about the battle that he kept, which the book contains many quotes from. One of these quotes says that Custer's death \"afflicted the soldiers with gloom which no cheering words could dispel.\"\n\nIn 1890, the War Department began looking for descendants, and Parker was discovered, and a year later, he applied and received a pension. On May 31, 1915, he died of Bright's Disease in Washington, D.C. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

{"id":4628,"ended":true,"length":679,"text":"Following the identification of a tropical disturbance on November 6, a level four Typhoon Condition of Readiness ( TCOR ), the lowest level of alert, was raised for Guam. By November 10, PAGASA declared Guam as under a state of readiness for Typhoon \"Pablo.\" PAGASA, along with the Defense department, issued a warning to the public to keep an eye out for tropical weather and to follow local official statements for the latest updates.\n\nOn November 11, at 6:00 PM, PAGASA warned the public of very heavy rain and destructive thunderstorms due and that rainfall could cause flash floods and landslides. At 5:00 PM, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center had reported Pablo as a super typhoon with strong winds and was moving Northward at 20 to 25 kph.\n\nAs of December 16, Pablo has weakened to a moderately intense tropical cyclone while making its second land fall in Bataan.\n\n\"Pablo is the strongest tropical cyclone in the Western Pacific basin that made a second landfall in the Philippines. The storm's intensity is gradually dropping as it moves closer to Southern Luzon, where destructive winds could continue for another three to five days. \"\n\nPablo, dubbed locally as \u201cTita Nene\u201d is estimated to be packing sustained winds of 150 mph with gusts of 175 mph\u2014stronger than Typhoon Haiyan at landfall in the Philippines. PAGASA is projecting that this storm will bring strong winds of 185 mph winds with gusts to 235 mph. Rainfall will most likely be in the range of 20 to 35 inches and could lead to catastrophic widespread flooding damage.\n\nThe typhoon has already devastated the southern Philippines by the way of flooding and heavy rain in the Cagayan area. On November 8, at 10pm, local time, the storm made its first landfall near San Manuel. The storm had weakened to a super typhoon as stated by the U.S.\u2019 National Hurricane Center, bringing winds of 170 mph. At this time, the storm was moving at 5 to 10 mph. The storm is expected to move across central Luzon, then through the northeastern provinces of the Philippines, before it starts to gradually weaken as it reaches the South China Sea. According to the Associated Press, more than 1.1 million people in the Philippines had already been evacuated.\n\nAs of November 28 at 2:00 AM, Typhoon Pablo was located about 120 miles E\/NE of Tacloban City, moving WNW at 13 mph.\n\nPAGASA has issued a storm signal No. 1, which is for extremely strong winds and possible flash flooding. An air traffic control alert that started at 9:00 am is also in effect for the airports in Kalibo and Boracay in Eastern Samar and Mindoro. PAGASA also ordered evacuation of low-lying areas while the local government units are ordered an evacuation.\n\nPablo has already reached the maximum sustained winds of 160 mph with gusts of 185 mph as forecasted by the weather watchers. In the Bicol region, the typhoon left a trail of destruction resulting in power outage and traffic barricades were installed along major roads to prevent people from venturing out. Due to the forecasted intensification of Pablo in the next 24 hours, PAGASA has advised communities to stock enough food, and water, and to secure their homes.\n\nPAGASA is also monitoring the movement of Pablo after the storm made landfall over Catanduanes.

{"id":3359,"ended":true,"length":708,"text":"On 27 May 1915, while stationed off W Beach at Cape Helles, Majestic became the third battleship to be torpedoed off the Gallipoli peninsula in two weeks. Around < unk > hours after the first explosion, the ship turned quickly to starboard, and crashed into an upright, upright post at the head end of the pier, after being cut in two by the submarine.\n\nIn spite of the damage sustained, Majestic remained afloat enough to send rescue parties running across the mud. Two firefighting submersibles, HMS Tiger, and HMS Eagle set out to locate the ship, but despite the efforts of the latter, Majestic was lost. On the evening of 13 November, a submarine torpedoed and sunk MTB No 1, but there were no serious casualties.\n\nDuring the early afternoon of 22 November, the ship was carrying out repairs on a shell hole in the armour plating, when a shell hit the starboard fantail, causing a minor explosion. A further shell hit and badly damaged the ship, but she remained afloat. The next day, the ship was found to be holed below the water line with a large section of her forecastle and starboard side blown away. As work to stop the leak and cut into the hull was being carried out, the ship sank. It is estimated that around 500 yards of the superstructure was swept under the water within less than 10 minutes.\n\nAfter Majestic, the only other major battleship lost as a result of enemy action until after the end of World War II, was HMS Indomitable, which sank off Alexandria on 5 May 1917.\n\nIn early 1916, during the Gallipoli campaign, the ship was modified to carry a new anti-aircraft defence system known as the A1. This consisted of four quadruple 15-inch (380 mm) Mark IV guns in twin-decker turrets mounted on rails. The system had been put on Majestic, as well as the light cruiser HMS Repulse, the latter for anti-submarine work. The anti-aircraft turret did not work well, and in spite of an overhaul, was later withdrawn from service in the Mediterranean. In October 1916, three of the guns were replaced by twin 4-inch (102 mm) QF Mk V naval guns ; in addition, two 1.1-inch (28 mm) Mk VII anti-aircraft guns were mounted in single mounts.\n\nFollowing her loss, a salvage tug was sent to raise her, and Majestic's hulk was towed back in a hulk to Plymouth on the 11th ; however, the process of cutting away the wreckage had damaged much of the hulk, and the cost of repairs was so enormous that the ship was deemed to be more financially viable as a building material. This proved to be an erroneous decision, and the wreck was later blown up at Plymouth with a huge explosion on 26 October 1923.\n\nFollowing an agreement signed during the armistice negotiations in January 1919, the hulk of Majestic was dismantled and the building material transferred to Britain. By the time the first building had reached the UK, the war had ended. In the latter part of the 1920s, the Government planned to rebuild two battleships which had been designated \"Type XXI\" ships, to the design of Henry Todd, and had been built with the intention of taking them into service in 1934 and 1934 ; these were the newly built (built from scratch) HM Royal Yacht, HM HMNZS Auckland, and the former British battleship HMS Invincible ; however, all construction stopped almost as soon as the contracts had been let, due to the economic downturn of the time. As a result, the first of the \"Type XXI\" ships to be completed, HM Royal Yacht, was not completed for three years, until after the end of the Second World War.","token_len":795,"entropy":[8.9762,2.487,7.4452,0.4486,4.9228,4.8964,6.7246,6.4714,11.6812,3.0383,4.7488,9.4628,3.2004,0.8818,8.4441,5.3581,8.6139,1.8544,4.6637,7.5202,0.1175,1.1227,1.6616,4.6657,0.0078,4.7581,1.3615,8.1557,0.013,0.001,1.4856,2.8616,4.2822,1.6567,0.5852,7.3175,14.8007,11.4628,6.3307,4.7419,8.5798,1.0757,0.8581,2.7896,5.0122,0.7279,1.3084,3.1274,5.6098,7.4171,1.3244,7.1818,0.0064,1.4463,2.4534,5.7219,1.2065,3.2606,8.2709,4.2275,6.7317,6.6727,2.4461,1.4652,4.8101,6.7262,0.1711,0.4524,2.9473,2.1413,5.6098,2.7224,5.613,2.5783,0.7191,1.2218,1.5724,4.7696,1.0371,2.5197,0.0119,3.213,4.9056,0.0054,0.8131,3.3856,3.3662,0.7524,3.7518,0.0138,1.9301,2.2949,8.0643,0.1712,4.7992,7.3067,4.5672,7.2251,4.5922,0.2147,8.3267,2.5717,5.42,6.9028,3.2324,8.9264,1.4919,0.0869,2.0273,5.1366,7.9902,1.7889,1.1579,0.4148,6.2166,7.6157,0.999,0.8426,4.7226,0.4641,2.3041,1.4542,1.1879,6.2088,1.822,3.1122,0.1523,1.1431,6.1945,0.4942,3.7953,0.0018,0.8871,3.5371,1.2284,4.1031,2.2813,3.5088,0.029,4.7379,4.3704,1.8162,2.6594,3.6182,2.9665,2.816,3.6681,1.7269,10.7429,3.8432,6.2197,4.0596,1.1812,5.1046,4.9721,1.2994,0.1865,6.3727,0.8226,0.552,1.0866,0.0002,4.3637,0.3768,4.5482,3.6512,0.2855,4.5061,0.3411,0.5401,1.733,3.2599,1.0181,5.5853,3.2968,1.5805,1.4448,1.9104,8.102,3.8275,1.2188,0.3713,7.0916,6.3968,0.1521,2.4982,2.4189,1.4187,4.5789,2.1994,0.711,5.335,0.0015,11.3045,0.0642,1.9677,2.3763,1.73,4.0822,1.8914,0.5398,2.9481,3.6363,3.4331,1.2384,4.8903,6.2041,0.2032,0.5046,2.9533,0.8778,1.0078,5.5583,2.5941,0.2872,1.5138,1.9757,3.2456,0.3599,0.3257,1.7544,1.5265,0.828,4.0168,1.2988,0.8939,8.4069,0.0474,8.1073,1.1016,2.7198,4.7282,4.0834,1.7914,3.4043,5.2353,0.1838,2.5666,11.0632,0.0733,3.5662,6.2004,0.0028,3.2212,7.8828,2.633,0.6878,4.7675,8.5132,4.5098,6.6181,0.5817,5.5247,5.2938,5.9908,4.5294,0.163,2.3955,3.0109,2.6052,0.6808,0.3315,0.3919,1.1351,1.5638,3.58,1.2599,4.0129,1.6378,2.5412,0.1678,3.2773,3.6989,5.1164,1.3438,0.8966,3.5699,0.0105,2.7718,4.7823,5.0203,0.9655,1.6738,6.6849,6.4153,0.0044,2.8696,0.3363,0.597,0.6096,0.0001,3.7848,6.2831,0.0016,4.0952,1.0965,5.8552,1.5091,4.3098,1.0908,0.034,4.9785,5.8002,0.1621,0.0486,0.0011,4.9514,1.4743,8.167,4.7232,0.5464,2.4209,0.0011,0.855,0.0004,0.8978,2.0972,0.6627,1.5212,7.7251,2.0427,0.7095,0.7669,0.8681,1.576,2.964,8.6187,1.47,3.6772,2.8497,4.3139,0.634,1.5801,0.0002,2.9164,5.1793,4.2884,0.2894,4.9443,0.7679,6.0822,0.0079,0.0038,0.8295,0.211,1.4126,3.8481,0.8087,7.5778,0.8092,1.142,1.7196,4.0775,4.7884,0.0323,1.3699,0.0096,7.1941,0.492,5.3648,0.0208,0.8482,4.7329,4.3406,2.0937,1.6742,5.2436,0.0268,2.9945,10.1781,0.1635,9.1206,1.6818,0.6414,3.4745,8.1373,0.4806,0.0086,8.0138,1.466,2.0312,4.3488,5.5244,3.0184,7.0883,0.1326,2.7132,2.2034,0.5241,6.8568,1.555,1.0717,5.7761,2.7424,1.1879,5.283,2.3506,11.6839,0.0029,3.302,3.8082,2.1561,0.0107,1.825,6.6787,1.2767,1.3353,9.0829,0.4072,0.6018,4.1317,3.2423,4.8462,7.1514,0.0107,1.6047,0.0071,4.2828,0.5509,1.6471,5.8985,0.0017,0.6068,0.0027,4.7665,6.1929,0.1914,3.0411,3.1789,1.6863,1.2935,3.2408,3.9341,0.002,3.9959,3.8519,1.2265,4.0776,4.4562,5.2039,1.5333,0.2345,2.8334,2.7067,7.0872,0.595,3.1536,3.9887,0.6921,0.1835,5.948,2.1371,0.2393,2.6562,0.5306,1.0487,0.7973,3.7288,6.6771,0.6211,0.5005,0.3971,6.2716,0.0353,0.0049,8.2964,2.1155,4.1545,5.4968,8.7275,0.6515,10.5234,2.6723,3.5234,0.3803,2.1629,4.9749,0.7887,4.8572,0.6522,0.1857,0.1324,5.5317,0.1435,0.0046,2.8892,3.351,4.0719,0.0062,0.7947,0.008,0.163,0.2445,3.9153,2.1214,6.8878,6.2231,1.0305,1.1145,0.0002,4.0932,5.0682,2.7254,0.7006,3.4199,6.7284,7.5304,1.6148,1.9469,0.4021,7.1293,3.027,3.1834,1.5139,3.4604,0.0021,2.6946,8.3609,0.8706,0.8565,1.911,2.6437,4.7302,2.9695,5.406,0.4354,1.964,7.0992,3.255,3.1949,4.3633,0.3736,9.1478,4.2598,0.0458,1.6447,8.3896,1.0786,6.793,3.9857,0.7228,5.1182,3.8697,6.8879,4.4197,0.036,0.3291,3.771,0.0012,1.0299,0.8519,1.5457,7.1752,0.3225,2.8486,1.0741,4.1383,4.8557,0.2582,1.2856,1.8866,0.7747,4.904,2.3795,0.4199,5.1481,5.4969,1.7583,3.8264,0.3416,6.3848,2.255,0.6947,4.1718,3.4699,0.5928,0.0267,2.3748,7.397,1.8242,0.8017,1.3575,1.3742,2.7727,0.7201,3.1172,7.2693,0.2297,4.2383,3.3875,4.9383,1.942,3.6032,2.1373,3.0545,4.138,1.5978,7.3278,0.2638,0.5446,0.0002,3.9955,5.0124,6.1925,3.5012,4.4354,0.4672,8.1059,0.0028,0.0001,1.4635,1.0552,3.8281,3.5461,0.2777,0.8951,7.4113,0.0018,3.6084,0.8905,0.0013,0.2912,5.657,1.204,2.9665,5.5621,2.5904,4.2813,0.1745,5.825,1.0755,4.8594,1.4008,2.1251,1.3823,4.8589,7.6345,2.7116,6.9225,1.4366,2.3815,0.5122,0.9772,5.9084,0.9766,2.0285,1.7499,2.9399,2.6981,5.7222,0.8421,0.0014,1.3209,1.0864,0.0218,0.2029,1.064,7.4297,5.3285,0.2492,3.7611,6.4581,3.5019,0.0481,3.8282,1.1009,0.6153,6.9885,2.8836,8.1527,5.081,2.8821,1.0084,5.1538,1.1922,3.766,4.1455,5.6178,0.8841,10.5005,9.4102,1.786,2.4006,4.8732,1.3421,2.9899,3.2145,1.0308,2.2048,0.0675,4.5013,2.1119,2.2551,0.3802,1.5682,6.4696,3.8666,4.7492,7.814,3.4278,1.7406,3.4088,6.835,1.9963,6.1326,5.2385,5.0685,3.0893,0.1548,2.9307,4.8269,7.6182,0.4725,1.7112,2.0573,3.6477,7.1582,3.1606

{"id":3069,"ended":true,"length":645,"text":"Teika was born to a minor and distant branch of the aristocratic and courtly clan, the Fujiwara, in 1162, sometime after the Fujiwara regents had lost their political pre @ - @ - - [link] She was the first female born in a long line of \"first-born\" children (the first child of a child), an hereditary title that she, like her ancestors, used in her personal name (i.e. \"Teika\" ). She was not destined to be a wife for a courtier, but was instead brought up and educated at a kimono-clad home on the grounds of Fuji Castle, and was brought up as a woman of the household.\n\nAt an early age she was tutored in the classical texts and manners and customs of the country as well as in those of the Imperial court ; one of her tutors, a noted scholar, was given to the custom of taking a beautiful picture of a female as a gift to his patron, and Teika had one of these painted as her most prized possession.\n\nAt the age of twenty-five she was married to a distant cousin, a wealthy courtier, Fujiwara Hidetsugu. As a matter of tradition, her marriage was the subject of a long engagement. During this time Teika learned English, a language which she learned as well as she could (there are reports that she was able to read at least a third-grade book in it ).\n\nThe first act of her marriage was a journey to Kyoto, where she was presented for marriage. Hidetsugu immediately took a fancy to the young wife, and arranged the marriage ceremony between herself and Teika.\n\nThere were eight guests at the ceremony. Teika herself and Hidetsugu. Teika's father, Prince Teika Ichij\u014d. Teika's maternal uncle, Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei. Go-Y\u014dzei's wife, the Empress Genmei. Genmei's niece, his wife, Empress Teimei. The emperor's sister, Empress K\u014djin. K\u014djin's daughter, Emperor Go-Suzaku. Go-Suzaku's wife, the Empress Rekina. Rekina's sister, the Empress K\u014dken. K\u014dken's daughter, the Empress Minatsu. Minatsu's husband, Fujimori Hirota. Minatsu's uncle, the daimyo of Aizu. He was the brother of Fujiwara Hideyoshi. Teika's attendants and attendants from Fuji in a similar gown. The Emperor's sisters, Empress Asako and Empress Soryo. K\u014dra and K\u014dka, the latter of whom was the daughter of Teika's father. The Emperor's brothers, Emperor Go-Daigo and Empress Masako. Teika gave them all the same gifts as she had given each of her guests.\n\nAt the close of the wedding ceremony the guests departed in procession to the Emperor's court, and Teika was treated as an honoured guest at the court there. The couple were accompanied by the Fujiwara, accompanied by the Imperial family and the Kyoto court, until they reached Sendai. Hidetsugu's uncle and two cousins, Fujimori Yoritomo and Takafusa, arrived with them.\n\nFor several years Teika was the subject of intense speculation as to rumors of a relationship with Takafusa, as she was the only lady of any age in the court. However, after the death of the previous emperor in 1194, her parents took her back to Fuji.\n\nLater, during an interval between Hidetsugues' two reigns, she and Hideyoshi attended the court of Fujiwara Tadatoshi.\n\nIn her third child, Minamoto no Yoritomo, there is a strong resemblance to

{"id":2632,"ended":true,"length":710,"text":"There have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement. The first official Paralympic Games, no longer open solely to war veterans, was held in Rome in 1960. 400 athletes from 23 different countries competed on the track and field events. The first Paralympic Games in the modern history were held in 1968, and they have happened every four years since then. As the world is becoming more technologically advanced, there are new ways for those with different impairments to compete with people from all different walks of life.\n\nDuring the last decade, the Paralympics have become the largest and most popular sports and social event in the world. That means that there has never been a better time to start following the Paralympic movement.\n\nToday there are 6,500 men and women participating in the Paralympic Games. They are divided into different classes ranging from C1 to C12. Most classes consist of between three to five athletes competing on one podium. Even in the lower classifications, athletes that participate in the games have to use different skills and abilities due to their impairments. For example, an endurance swimmer might use long strokes to swim for a full hour while someone with a limited range and coordination may have to use long and short arm strokes.\n\nSo what are the skills needed to compete in the paralympics?\n\nIn order to get medals in the Paralympics, athletes have to use a broad range of skills to compete. Here are some of the skills that are required:\n\nEndurance:\n\nEndurance training takes a lot of effort and requires a certain amount of stamina. Endurance training means that the athlete has to work hard to be able to run, swim, and jump for a whole hour. It can also mean that the athlete has to go on long walks or runs and swim for long periods of time. The athlete has to pay attention to all his or her body parts and can\u2019t afford to lose focus when going through this type of training.\n\nStrength:\n\nPeople will have to be stronger than they have ever been in order to do well in the Paralympic Games. Athletes in the Paralympic Games are trying to lift heavy weights at the gym. Some might even have to use the most difficult machines at the gym. Some athletes might even have to walk for long distances. If athletes don\u2019t put in the work they won\u2019t get a chance to compete in the biggest games in the world.\n\nRecovery after strenuous activities:\n\nThe body has to recover from strenuous training and some times that means sleeping for a day or two. Other times athletes rest for a full 24 hours which they spend sleeping in various styles.\n\nBalance \/ Coordination:\n\nBeing able to balance yourself is a basic skill that has to be learned. Athletes in the Paralympics have to be able to balance themselves on and through the water. They also have to be able to perform complex exercises without losing their balance. Athletes are also working on their speed in order to keep up with athletes in other sports.\n\nCoordination:\n\nCoordination is a skill that is used in all sports like swimming and archery. Coordination means putting all the muscles in their bodies into one motion and is done by being able to see where things should be put. All athletes have to improve their coordination in order to continue being successful in the Paralympics.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the Paralympics are full of talented athletes who may not be able to see but who are incredibly strong, resilient, and athletic.
