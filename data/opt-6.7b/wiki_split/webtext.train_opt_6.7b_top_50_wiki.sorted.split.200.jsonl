QED explains electromagnetism, gravitation, and the strong interaction by means of the action of four fundamental excitations of the electromagnetic field (the quark-gluon plasma is an exciton) and four quantum numbers which describe those excitations. The fundamental excitations are often named the gluons, and the four numbers are, in descending order, the coulomb, the photon, the photon quanta and the photon density. Quantum numbers were given by Paul Dirac in 1932, who said (in French) that the four quantum numbers are named for their physical qualities rather than as a kind of hierarchy.

The Celts were amongst the earliest producers of butter in Britain, and for hundreds of years were the largest butter-producing nation. Butter production was so important to Celtic society that the Celts were willing to sacrifice much of their time and efforts in order to preserve the milk for their children's nutrition. A good example of this can be seen at the time of the invasion of the Picts; the Scots who escaped the Picts, brought back numerous Pictish butter containers into Scotland, which are believed by some to be Celtic in origin.\n\nSome of the earliest accounts of the use of the cow by man can be found in the Bible.

Once you receive the results, you just need to decide if you want to move on and take a leave of absence to Unicamp or take the official admissions exam.\n\nFor more general information about applying for the program, refer to our website.","token_len":205,"entropy":[12.801,10.2064,1.5242,3.2836,1.702,1.9332,4.5092,5.7198,2.9226,1.8793,4.8637,0.3506,0.7672,4.0667,3.7375,12.0343,13.0212,7.3523,1.606,0.9965,0.0392,3.3806,0.0427,4.7294,2.1863,1.9864,5.5591,2.5337,2.9096,2.7287,5.2744,5.5581,2.9737,0.6275,8.2887,0.2721,1.8409,3.1244,1.4712,2.7681,5.1055,3.2406,1.3625,3.1481,1.2865,5.951,1.3854,5.2224,1.6311,6.8143,2.4102,2.7798,2.2165,0.3863,0.254,0.5571,2.2905,5.7899,3.6104,0.7918,5.198,0.283,2.9824,1.8903,2.7176,4.1101,0.0558,0.3819,2.913,0.8027,4.7441,3.0,5.9863,3.309,6.8168,2.2411,1.9731,3.2415,6.931,2.5793,5.0759,0.0404,0.659,1.4747,0.1058,3.4747,5.5069,3.7768,2.6726,4.872,5.8195,3.5535,5.4547,3.5585,0.2497,4.7917,2.526,2.925,0.3338,0.39,2.2048,0.7355,0.9133,0.001,4.6742,0.2955,3.0639,2.7756,7.3076,2.565,0.1031,2.2356,2.1486,0.011,0.2687,0.6464,2.0536,4.4558,2.8595,4.1842,2.9114,4.625,5.286,6.6759,1.2563,2.2568,1.8803,2.8466,2.5542,0.0103,3.1474,7.3836,2.1104,1.0326,4.4881,0.6305,4.8467,4.1393,0.3418,3.0385,1.1688,1.857,3.0167,2.8687,2.8757,2.2573,0.0982,4.9983,3.9107,4.2351,0.1392,6.3216,3.4896,1.6046,3.5076,0.3779,1.6656,0.8597,1.8226,0.9957,0.376,7.6746,1.0324,0.0447,5.8293,1.5582,0.2216,0.6981,0.1114,4.5601,0.6801,2.6191,4.2358,1.9512,3.5781,0.3179,0.0003,2.5991,10.6689,0.0145,1.795,4.5124,2.4621,4.7202,6.41,1.8748,0.4023,0.4872,0.0002,3.8562,0.8871,7.321,0.1514,0.982,4.3974,0.7088,2.8802,4.955,0.5329,5.2981,0.0063,1.7876,3.2153,1.0908]}

In 1966 an agreement was reached between the governments of the US, UK, USSR, China, Sweden and Australia to eliminate the last two known outbreaks, on the Indian and Pacific oceans. It took seven years of intensive work involving millions of people to eradicate this disease which had an annual mortality rate of about 1 percent. By the summer of 1977, however, one last outbreak was reported in Russia, causing a very serious concern and a major international effort and expense. In 1979, it was reported that the last individual patient in the world was suffering from smallpox. At the height of that campaign there were 694 million doses of smallpox vaccine on hand, not to mention the effort put into making other vaccines and drugs to reduce the harm caused by smallpox vaccine. Although much effort was made to produce a smallpox vaccine, there is still no practical vaccine available in most areas.","token_len":208,"entropy":[10.9624,4.3851,3.1283,3.7272,3.0481,1.5521,0.0399,1.2851,0.6142,1.5832,4.6654,0.126,0.0757,1.3721,4.2212,2.7659,4.1482,1.9647,0.163,1.1617,3.0327,2.6558,7.0468,2.6995,1.3639,5.3909,0.7145,1.9147,0.2067,2.3569,1.5785,3.2973,6.559,5.61,7.7157,0.5152,0.1586,1.2977,0.7264,3.6029,0.0515,2.0367,2.6643,1.1311,1.9459,0.6154,6.4105,0.674,2.164,0.5613,5.5306,0.8218,3.2766,1.1156,3.1028,1.1904,6.8575,3.3717,4.2133,4.7457,2.6877,6.2286,1.6512,7.4734,2.4386,2.8832,5.7932,0.7411,3.1428,3.8968,4.3085,0.1534,2.2649,4.0938,2.6071,8.3582,4.723,0.0196,0.7492,0.9504,3.232,2.4944,2.0952,6.1796,2.168,5.6229,4.3473,2.1573,0.3986,0.127,1.8522,2.3658,3.7403,0.3123,4.5797,1.6011,5.8229,0.0285,3.799,0.9375,4.3575,0.0081,5.0714,6.8427,1.6012,1.8585,1.085,1.0281,5.1828,1.2827,3.0564,2.5487,5.1345,2.5674,7.1282,3.6938,2.221,2.898,2.6692,2.7065,6.4486,8.8213,0.7512,2.5261,3.2876,0.7262,3.7172,0.5088,1.7453,0.2419,1.9078,3.7307,7.4662,4.6391,2.0357,0.8002,3.1242,2.2586,4.1267,0.18,5.7086,0.0025,0.9298,4.9301,0.8663,5.2261,0.0027,4.1503,4.2482,3.6744,0.2175,4.668,4.9375,4.2109,3.3118,0.2593,1.0723,0.0052,2.183,5.218,1.7306,2.0138,6.0171,3.9018,0.0387,1.3836,6.9908,4.598,1.1211,3.5318,6.2642,0.4332,3.1793,4.9843,2.8818,3.2325,0.4873,6.6576,1.2955,0.2363,1.345,0.0092,4.6361,0.5486,4.9549,5.3916,3.3327,0.8543,1.2935,0.506,5.5616,2.3532,3.8166,0.0583,0.0647,0.8907,2.5291,2.9992,1.6528,1.1668,6.3786,3.1785,2.0721,2.9282,3.3358,3.3286,1.3152]}

That is to say, the quantum vacuum is capable of interacting with certain particles :\n\nHowever, we may also speculate that magnetic susceptibility may have a more fundamental physics origin and may involve the quantum vacuum and that is in this article.","token_len":210,"entropy":[2.5374,6.186,7.0945,13.36,4.6682,5.9114,0.6506,0.01,3.5289,7.0336,2.8907,3.714,0.7497,2.5261,1.4675,5.7203,0.8736,0.0653,2.7316,0.2207,3.9326,2.0691,2.9294,0.0433,1.5729,10.5167,0.0355,4.7032,5.6572,0.1732,4.5725,1.3521,3.6025,0.3878,3.7491,7.7686,0.2712,0.0088,4.277,0.5782,5.5049,0.5936,2.6457,1.3737,0.6367,6.7844,2.5444,1.8795,6.027,1.2297,1.9871,2.0864,3.3739,2.805,3.7546,3.6165,5.901,2.0705,6.6924,1.1381,3.7591,0.014,3.8097,0.4681,5.318,0.1172,2.8697,2.6437,4.4819,4.9715,0.9817,0.0074,5.9423,3.0012,2.0973,4.0881,9.1684,4.6537,7.2893,6.6131,0.5472,4.9123,0.3826,1.404,1.2918,2.2542,2.0696,3.65,4.766,3.8672,0.9127,0.8817,0.0019,5.675,4.4997,3.8426,1.0069,1.9089,0.7629,0.0014,0.2812,3.1564,2.6821,0.3065,0.1068,1.2971,5.8575,0.085,7.2711,2.5864,4.595,0.0249,1.4573,4.8963,1.0707,0.3983,2.2871,2.8861,6.5025,3.9398,5.0372,1.0496,0.3205,8.055,0.0001,5.2386,1.8861,1.6551,5.643,0.5363,3.4733,0.0942,0.003,5.0689,7.3732,3.5738,4.9344,0.6208,4.6972,7.5522,0.495,1.6831,0.6054,0.0036,1.6125,4.8536,4.8524,6.4243,2.9444,2.0308,6.9626,3.675,5.1672,2.8174,2.5986,1.488,2.9289,0.0505,10.7369,1.0081,6.8882,0.783,4.396,0.3301,3.0843,0.0124,0.2691,1.7278,3.1966,0.8126,1.4925,5.0933,0.0213,4.0591,0.3674,5.6692,3.4997,11.9457,1.4977,0.0002,3.6351,0.1019,2.8066,3.8504,1.5888,5.5625,0.5296,4.5849,5.3239,1.716,2.8265,1.3309,2.7095,2.341,6.6717,7.3963,3.3582,2.8736,4.6408,1.7559,3.6712,1.3763,3.4311,3.9402,3.1623,4.6222,3.7481,6.4933,1.1234]}

{"id":1160,"ended":true,"length":206,"text":"Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan recognizes that fire and other disturbances play important roles in maintaining the character and function of ecosystems. However, previous management strategies ( as recently as the 1940s ) treated the entire forest as a single, static unit that was manipulated to meet the needs of timber production, recreation, or a few prescribed uses. Such objectives failed to recognize that the health and productivity of an area depend on the variety of habitats and the diversity of species. The result was the loss of a significant portion of the forest's unique diversity, and increased risk for catastrophic fire and other disturbances. The 2009 Forest Management Plan ( FMP ) for the Boise National Forest will move away from such objectives by developing a more flexible and adaptive national forest land management system. It recognizes the complexity of the Boise Forest, as well as the complexity of its ecosystems, and uses a more balanced framework to guide the management of the whole forest and individual land uses. This plan also adopts a more active approach to management and public engagement in managing areas of environmental concern.","token_len":210,"entropy":[8.0278,7.4128,2.3838,5.075,9.0794,5.1598,2.2056,8.1022,1.7774,6.4057,2.5989,2.6205,3.9556,6.3918,3.9074,0.1724,0.0694,3.0967,1.7724,6.8754,1.6669,4.3439,0.0067,5.6494,0.732,3.8903,0.0015,7.1229,4.9724,2.6069,4.8661,10.9982,5.5799,0.8784,3.307,4.0296,0.1881,2.1904,8.9654,2.3206,5.4371,1.4095,1.2849,0.6299,2.2657,2.14,5.8362,3.0712,2.478,1.7927,7.4982,1.9626,3.953,1.661,0.6746,0.0825,8.0174,3.6976,1.9165,5.8128,0.4828,4.0742,4.7406,3.4194,10.0651,3.6049,0.3338,4.5578,6.9638,5.9656,0.3158,3.6649,1.1106,1.9174,7.7394,1.1184,3.8708,0.0502,4.2375,3.1224,3.8311,0.4812,0.8251,6.3628,0.3147,4.5278,1.5799,1.907,3.8577,0.0569,2.8089,1.9469,2.5411,5.5605,0.8917,2.5078,2.7681,0.0166,2.9355,3.8223,1.0842,0.0121,0.7107,1.033,1.2747,4.2215,2.594,1.5762,2.0599,4.0977,2.6403,1.6697,5.3041,2.0742,1.5357,1.1089,0.9263,0.3895,2.4072,5.9018,1.1422,2.159,1.3355,2.0339,4.5977,2.5579,0.4845,3.3472,0.528,8.1525,0.2807,0.0285,5.6667,6.0822,2.7119,0.0163,3.7621,3.8005,2.6313,4.747,0.8365,2.868,4.7227,1.8894,3.6853,7.4421,0.1335,6.7492,0.8127,3.2967,1.0861,3.1476,3.5432,1.8374,5.4666,0.3178,1.5746,5.2751,3.0554,3.526,3.3508,0.1617,0.0071,0.5336,3.3951,0.1271,2.5789,3.2991,0.5335,0.9863,5.1147,1.9774,2.2488,3.853,5.4875,0.9609,3.4789,1.9585,1.7218,0.1532,0.8578,5.6189,2.146,3.2755,7.1068,5.1151,1.4236,0.2942,2.716,2.5303,2.1036,6.7006,0.0005,1.1356,1.8776,4.4156,1.8782,0.2744,3.0405,2.5311,5.2277,2.8064,2.7709,4.3206,5.9262,1.471,6.3662,1.9653,0.8756]}

Still, their first round opponent in the playoffs was the Nets, a talented squad that managed to win against them in two straight games.

Alan Robinson had discovered a simple method to implement deduction on discrete-state AI systems, by creating a decision tree algorithm. More recently, in the year 2007, Leon Chua, along with a colleague from Microsoft Research in Beijing, developed the world's first multi-core deep neural network (ANN), which is capable of learning on the world's largest databases. In 2012, Google, IBM, Microsoft and DARPA are reported to have launched a joint research project, named Deep Blue, which led to IBM breaking the world chess computer record held by Garry Kasparov of Russia.

Most grasshoppers are polyphagous, so they can use different plants or trees as sources if they need to.","token_len":213,"entropy":[10.9904,3.5876,0.8968,2.0756,9.0938,3.1858,1.3753,0.1559,1.0494,6.7314,6.0165,3.5935,4.5693,4.98,3.8281,1.4562,3.4334,3.3205,1.4191,2.7438,0.0008,0.7743,1.9168,5.1065,1.947,5.6616,6.1912,2.1286,4.8709,4.0219,0.0002,0.0025,0.4805,3.5601,3.5764,6.328,6.5747,2.4533,1.4135,2.2874,5.2631,2.9893,3.4755,4.9555,6.2957,1.9572,0.2485,0.9702,0.6256,1.2051,2.9675,2.3126,7.6384,6.4295,6.9975,4.6448,3.9173,5.6793,1.9531,0.6561,1.7337,1.3104,0.001,3.4769,3.3746,0.6636,2.2634,3.6579,6.8823,1.2699,3.8075,7.6449,1.1023,0.9356,1.2547,0.1779,0.9231,1.5015,1.2288,4.9077,1.326,1.6039,6.6889,6.7284,5.6698,4.7524,0.6635,7.4575,9.4853,8.04,8.4886,8.145,1.7321,9.6212,5.5731,0.558,1.213,4.4892,0.3259,1.635,2.5664,3.8123,0.8686,1.8219,0.9434,0.6532,4.5274,1.1749,2.5432,0.2484,0.1601,0.5642,1.4195,0.6865,0.2299,7.1801,3.0418,3.9167,1.547,0.6114,1.0284,1.1457,5.0207,1.2969,5.3823,6.759,0.9299,0.0478,1.962,1.0259,1.0206,0.0002,4.4384,6.3768,0.2814,0.9068,3.6629,1.4019,3.7052,1.4716,0.7376,5.9529,0.9156,3.4387,1.7549,0.0654,0.1938,0.8704,4.764,1.2076,3.0551,1.5543,5.8643,0.0182,1.9383,4.6241,0.1452,4.5793,3.4415,8.663,4.0069,4.5049,3.9542,2.8769,0.381,2.9369,3.376,4.1592,2.1328,4.599,3.9307,1.6144,0.8442,0.0001,0.2621,0.75,0.9457,2.7852,6.9932,5.1984,0.3164,4.8582,5.4687,1.5093,6.0619,2.642,2.5094,5.0018,2.6881,0.0014,0.0127,2.2087,5.0908,0.0137,0.0052,0.001,0.3544,5.7447,1.1766,2.7069,4.9294,4.6075,2.2748,3.8394,4.3776,2.543,3.9798,6.3019,0.5727,2.3266,0.5052,0.6926]}

He was born in 2329 on a Federation colony near Cardassian space in the demilitarized zone. While young, he fell into a coma when a stray photon torpedo struck his quarters, resulting in serious brain damage. As a result, he grew up without a sense of moral responsibility, leading to his eventual rejection from Starfleet and the Maquis ( though he was later pardoned ). He was hired by Voyager's captain Janeway after she rescued him from the Cardassians in 2372. During his time aboard Voyager, Chakotay and B'Elanna Torres had one child together, K'Ehleyr, who died in an accident when she was three years old. The trauma also strained Chakotay's relationship with Torres to the point he felt he could not trust her as a wife or a mother. As the ship approached the edge of the galaxy in 2401, he made a choice to end his tour of duty and return to his home planet.","token_len":214,"entropy":[6.8439,4.1611,1.2285,4.2536,9.468,3.0287,6.0401,5.2668,1.0429,5.0305,0.0112,6.2084,0.4242,6.2677,3.3584,2.654,2.6301,1.0241,3.7518,0.9585,4.5295,5.4372,1.6418,2.2481,4.7871,2.1746,5.3756,5.3031,1.6496,1.084,3.6198,1.2643,11.1497,0.0897,0.0007,0.0549,0.1758,1.6536,4.3268,5.2831,0.1507,0.4587,4.9043,2.1317,0.9092,2.8325,2.735,2.1674,6.1623,3.0696,0.0758,3.0237,0.8998,7.5518,1.7533,3.3983,0.0022,6.2708,1.6441,0.12,0.3073,4.0445,0.5117,1.1554,0.3081,0.859,5.5208,0.6164,2.9482,1.4578,5.1718,0.0101,6.726,1.956,1.3951,5.3357,0.877,1.5275,3.2074,5.0708,3.761,0.3572,1.495,2.5003,8.628,0.0045,0.0095,5.0253,10.8869,0.9861,2.2607,2.379,5.8914,0.0003,4.0655,2.0082,1.6259,7.5055,0.5533,4.5109,2.8542,2.5525,5.8022,0.0055,4.3553,1.922,4.8591,0.6291,0.3184,1.302,5.3978,1.0863,0.0109,2.1149,0.5207,4.4931,0.7541,3.7585,1.3903,1.0392,1.359,1.0581,0.1802,0.5459,0.0001,0.0,4.4017,5.3863,0.0674,0.016,0.0005,0.0401,3.6358,4.7677,4.1191,1.7106,0.7917,4.9228,1.1954,2.6289,0.0218,0.0317,1.0973,1.2086,2.4719,1.2675,4.2308,0.7509,3.4089,2.1202,0.9916,3.8237,0.4934,0.0546,0.2401,3.2097,8.0518,5.7139,7.4793,2.7233,0.0007,0.0014,0.4276,1.9477,0.0288,2.2183,5.5943,0.5121,0.072,3.1737,4.0923,1.2684,2.1074,0.898,2.6653,0.7692,3.7628,0.8585,4.4473,2.1378,2.578,1.0134,0.478,4.106,2.8993,3.2094,4.5784,1.0027,3.6919,0.0036,0.9416,3.7664,2.4944,3.7528,2.68,0.1057,1.7788,5.24,1.0383,3.4872,0.6559,5.1277,0.3219,9.5084,0.3592,0.0048,1.2704,1.3522,0.3705,2.038,0.9049,0.8446,1.8323]}

Ulysses is Jupiter's only probe; it has six spacecraft instruments (3 instruments provide magnetometer, solar observer, and thermal measurements, while 3 more provided images); and it has the largest (2.2 m) solar panels ever built (NASA\/GSFC).","token_len":215,"entropy":[8.2658,3.3036,0.3901,5.3017,0.1866,1.8708,3.6597,9.2929,0.0002,10.9969,5.0955,3.8307,2.423,2.8723,1.4152,4.3845,0.1359,3.4345,1.5305,1.4823,0.0216,10.09,15.3082,6.9548,10.0279,9.2088,1.9971,1.1172,2.7126,9.8007,12.246,6.4362,5.03,7.564,9.2692,2.6403,2.6482,1.1533,2.9148,0.7706,0.0604,4.8764,2.3437,3.7544,2.6947,1.608,5.8725,0.4519,0.0006,6.2188,5.9488,6.4549,0.7462,2.2506,1.8481,2.654,6.9053,0.1919,0.0025,0.8672,3.3596,2.8397,1.7914,0.919,2.2608,2.04,5.5769,0.5805,2.1032,2.9321,3.1518,1.5861,1.1038,4.1758,0.2839,2.5684,5.3503,6.1348,10.9357,0.4212,0.6594,4.0181,4.5726,0.0021,0.0005,0.411,7.3419,4.9173,0.4834,0.0007,3.9169,1.4685,1.6012,1.7913,2.6957,1.3094,1.4082,8.3688,2.8893,5.1446,2.8486,4.2056,2.8199,2.0672,1.6672,1.5036,3.0711,3.0074,5.8708,9.7292,0.6907,2.2739,4.5233,1.2846,5.357,5.2829,0.5037,4.7789,0.2787,4.1851,2.3832,1.8694,2.1523,4.1022,3.1005,4.376,0.604,5.3691,1.5777,0.2544,1.834,0.0016,6.7002,2.0673,7.3645,0.9587,2.2332,3.1814,7.0667,0.6233,0.0007,3.9294,0.7187,7.0695,3.6574,0.9663,3.9053,0.0773,0.6954,0.6532,0.0002,6.0962,2.977,1.2579,1.1101,0.2966,0.0002,1.7659,0.5585,3.0538,0.106,0.0007,2.1372,7.0876,0.0189,3.2746,4.2586,5.1705,1.4255,2.355,5.2125,4.0399,10.7834,3.0167,6.3224,3.6834,9.5969,8.8064,0.6473,1.3845,4.3082,7.9612,0.1472,1.2933,4.8611,5.2785,2.0607,2.6893,3.834,5.8987,7.9115,6.8804,4.8912,1.9942,1.8019,1.3407,4.057,1.2911,4.6043,2.9238,0.6903,2.7063,3.0392,0.393,3.3098,3.6664,2.6532,2.4828,2.5109,4.7987,3.0481,2.4596,0.001,2.3326]}

{"id":1120,"ended":false,"length":178,"text":"Three oxides of xenon are known : xenon trioxide ( XeO 3 ) and xenon tetroxide ( XeO 4 ), both of which are dangerously explosive and powerful oxidizing agents, and xenon dioxide ( XeO 2 ), which appears to be inert, harmless to life and able to act as an electron acceptor. However, XeO 2 also appears to be an oxygen donor, since XeO 2 + 2 O 2 = 2 Xe + O 2. An interesting observation has been made for XeO 2, which, in the gas phase, decomposes into Xe + 4 O and Xe 2 O 4, with both compounds exhibiting high reactivity. This is presumably due to the fact that oxygen and xenon dioxides are extremely similar and are known to spontaneously form. The stability of this process has not yet been thoroughly characterized, but its nature might be responsible for the highly reactive nature of XeO 2. XeO 2 is currently classified as non-toxic.\n\nSources","token_len":215,"entropy":[11.9243,5.2245,2.4028,9.5976,0.907,2.0219,4.3101,10.8532,4.8135,0.3311,7.9629,1.3897,1.923,6.9015,6.4325,1.3616,3.5782,0.9692,1.3315,0.7436,0.0904,4.4692,1.2483,0.084,0.1562,0.6188,0.6808,1.3118,1.2034,2.104,2.828,0.5674,0.0173,0.6967,9.994,8.0212,1.9237,7.0004,3.8205,3.0236,0.2682,2.3201,1.6123,3.009,0.0896,5.6122,0.4212,0.9385,0.1413,0.1866,3.588,1.5119,0.7894,6.0653,0.3139,0.6095,5.4115,2.5226,5.8722,2.3443,6.4427,1.9432,7.1165,0.0585,4.3628,0.5015,1.6279,4.5445,7.2931,0.0128,1.188,3.488,0.0345,3.7364,0.0335,0.0124,1.0747,4.4501,2.7174,0.1433,0.7221,3.6057,4.9629,5.0526,1.075,5.3644,2.552,0.0223,0.0026,0.8408,7.3231,3.7978,4.0935,1.5295,4.0328,1.917,4.1098,0.9366,8.0021,3.9521,0.1067,5.938,5.4952,3.9709,3.315,4.3584,0.2931,0.6649,4.8822,1.8397,0.0507,0.0564,0.5303,5.3478,1.495,4.1464,2.0926,2.3737,7.9985,1.9688,0.3292,7.4634,0.0669,1.6188,2.8314,0.0713,6.0457,4.7817,1.9295,5.0697,1.5086,0.0142,3.4962,5.0651,4.0904,5.7,3.2142,4.3787,5.3442,5.6882,3.6643,5.9495,0.031,1.734,2.453,1.901,5.7661,0.9414,0.0253,0.6633,2.0223,0.0263,4.3218,3.4363,3.6722,0.0747,7.3304,3.6693,0.2225,0.9056,4.1283,3.4286,3.1216,2.9136,4.4176,0.4252,7.106,2.4856,2.6384,2.2505,7.0484,0.1492,3.3956,3.9686,2.4424,2.6646,2.3047,0.0283,5.6852,5.4826,0.8246,0.7393,3.9491,5.1777,4.3478,0.9946,5.5521,0.1158,1.0432,4.8226,3.5679,2.0712,0.0393,1.1553,0.0115,0.0774,0.3244,1.9415,3.9251,0.0527,0.0599,0.3857,1.5006,5.0488,4.6872,0.4521,4.2795,0.5636,2.7796,0.0559,2.3971,1.7143,0.0112,6.9152]}

It is possible that a comparison of the play with other novels, stories, and poems by Wilde reveals an intentional ambiguity in the characterization of Salom\u00e8s so that the reader may be aware that the poet may have been both homosexual and heterosexual in his affections. It is my contention that, if Wilde and Salom\u00e8s are to be viewed as mirror images of one another, only one of the two may be fully reflected. A literary image is fully reflected when it mirrors a distinct individual as much as it does another. In's plays, his mirror images are as real to him as are real to a typical person.

Call the 24-Hour Storm Alert Hotline at (877) 774-4587 in the event of an overflow that cannot be seen due to vegetation in the stream.","token_len":222,"entropy":[9.0381,3.6534,6.0455,9.6329,2.3205,2.0342,7.9284,2.277,1.9857,5.4478,8.2344,1.2925,3.0354,10.2964,2.9335,0.9264,0.82,4.7141,2.0868,3.0594,3.5159,1.436,5.4372,2.6062,1.725,5.5419,0.559,3.8482,2.3019,6.3584,1.8034,1.9662,1.2433,2.7179,6.1951,0.5162,1.5558,4.186,5.8272,0.8042,2.3293,4.0529,3.284,1.1149,1.5898,4.1497,1.3253,0.8994,0.0004,2.0471,4.4642,2.9586,7.3062,2.03,4.8113,2.7212,1.1353,2.9004,1.3538,7.7999,3.6441,2.4072,4.2988,0.4075,0.8467,4.9742,5.4978,2.7114,5.8511,4.4322,6.8827,7.0811,0.0852,2.7766,2.5903,0.6791,3.5699,5.1463,0.8155,1.0133,2.7807,2.4029,4.9253,0.0187,0.6733,4.2345,2.2201,0.5223,0.4883,0.1998,1.077,1.7123,4.6421,5.4792,11.3734,6.8834,12.3615,3.0472,2.0864,0.9201,4.5498,1.8206,1.0042,0.0002,4.6982,1.0016,6.4406,3.2307,0.5546,7.3873,0.0021,0.0008,1.0343,2.9926,7.7047,0.2522,3.9177,4.6465,0.5752,3.7486,4.2674,0.4341,1.8045,2.1788,0.0002,2.0245,1.6199,8.1567,2.4957,1.207,2.8384,2.4734,6.2827,4.3635,0.5081,4.5862,0.0754,0.1689,3.1157,8.0308,0.0416,4.3906,7.9824,1.5796,3.0851,0.1602,6.1055,5.9394,3.9638,2.234,5.5359,6.6359,3.1286,2.9384,1.5755,1.0776,5.4803,0.8224,0.882,0.0002,3.1587,0.54,8.1906,0.9327,1.0776,0.9019,1.7051,0.4067,1.2942,4.6844,0.0266,4.4803,3.6187,0.1775,0.9645,6.2944,0.0107,7.4295,0.01,5.3963,4.9289,3.5987,0.2966,2.7438,2.3371,0.7135,3.9597,1.8854,7.0137,0.5647,3.0794,9.6482,4.2571,4.7045,0.0066,0.2705,0.8465,4.2356,0.0078,2.6633,4.3165,0.0109,4.1742,4.4919,5.9017,0.9575,3.9163,0.3231,0.6771,1.3053,5.5513,4.8999,0.0083,6.6168,5.0845,0.0011,6.6454,4.1258,0.2923,1.9336,0.5452]}

As it is generally held that he was a grandson of Joshua, it would seem that his name, Jifna, should be of Hebrew derivation, and indicate `` an upper land. `` A later view is that he did not belong to the tribe of Benjamin but was the son of a non-Joshua, hence was not from the tribe of Judah. At any rate, the above mention and the identification of Joshua with Benjamin as his descendant, lead Mr. Robinson to conclude that Benjamin had been placed somewhere on the western slope of the hills, opposite the river Jordan, where the plain on the Jordan side would have presented a desirable site for his city; hence he might have chosen the site here referred to. This hypothesis corresponds in most respects to the general views in regard to the tribes, and is not in opposition to the Book of Joshua which would have been more than likely written during the years B.

His first lecture was given on 12th September 1956.","token_len":233,"entropy":[11.1056,0.2768,9.7346,5.3475,0.6897,2.8289,7.1022,15.514,8.233,4.6788,8.9513,12.9706,2.2107,0.9177,1.7998,5.0989,0.4719,5.7798,0.0977,2.4478,11.819,4.3199,2.5168,3.5607,9.6326,0.8205,1.6652,3.1926,3.878,3.12,7.5269,0.5655,2.1375,1.4956,4.4473,10.3571,1.2418,0.6378,1.5441,6.499,0.049,0.8438,4.5517,7.482,0.8773,1.67,0.0898,1.1177,1.0266,0.818,0.0686,6.1739,0.6821,3.8479,2.2033,4.1952,2.3704,0.8471,4.1789,9.8952,1.1525,0.2732,4.1367,0.9422,0.0648,6.5017,3.8861,2.9183,4.3883,0.5586,1.7508,2.8609,4.5892,4.832,0.22,0.7911,1.5285,0.5382,1.2683,5.2199,2.2089,0.431,4.1247,4.1854,1.1822,3.8901,0.0391,6.0188,4.6469,0.7411,1.5759,6.0145,3.7016,5.2319,0.0007,3.2177,3.3554,2.4791,5.2738,1.347,0.3358,5.9261,2.6129,0.8331,7.6006,4.6295,6.7892,3.6283,9.7,0.7875,1.6791,1.4025,4.0976,3.5349,1.5846,0.9538,4.0399,0.9017,7.2084,1.8176,7.8641,1.1123,2.6415,0.7112,2.131,1.6324,0.1785,2.5215,0.0005,7.459,1.1747,2.7148,0.8941,5.5091,1.3586,0.7882,0.6906,2.6538,0.1307,0.6445,0.0303,3.0868,7.3405,0.1875,0.0029,0.6955,2.2782,6.3822,0.1714,4.5482,0.7749,0.0425,0.165,3.757,1.5587,1.6611,0.0232,6.1166,1.4865,4.7316,0.0123,0.2925,8.4932,1.2756,3.1798,7.4769,0.247,5.1472,6.0582,7.6953,6.4328,7.7827,0.3454,4.3993,8.4517,1.2015,0.5642,6.8814,0.1339,4.1918,2.0479,1.8063,1.3649,1.9349,4.9274,5.1474,1.3243,0.7532,6.1066,0.1681,1.6049,3.4081,0.3713,3.6863,2.0576,3.6201,1.9404,4.2826,0.072,7.5208,0.1864,0.8174,1.616,1.5221,0.5072,4.4056,0.1641,12.5248,4.9875,1.439,3.2801,2.4415,1.862,7.6146,0.1217,0.9756,2.0172,0.3842,2.3465,5.1328,0.7245,3.9223,3.7526,3.694,1.1284,3.1436,2.3294,4.5898,2.2998,2.5886,1.4541,1.708]}

With the MX Series -- including the MX Series Router, the MX Series Switch, the MX Series Wireless Router, and the MX Series Access Point -- Juniper is now at parity with Cisco in terms of the packet-switching portion of its portfolio.\n\nIn addition, Juniper has begun to aggressively target this segment. Its sales teams have targeted the enterprise market and are aggressively trying to sell it as a packet-switching solution. Juniper's salespeople are trained to sell it as the company's only packet-switching product, rather than as a competitor to Cisco.\n\nOn January 24, 2008, Juniper revealed a software upgrade to its MX Series Switch called MX Series v 2. This new software version is designed specifically for the enterprise market and is available in software form only.

Volume I contains the biographical data on Walpole, along with his personal notes, writings, letters and diaries. Volume II contains the main essays by the various contributors. A useful addition to the two previous and more general biographical studies on Walpole was the publication of a volume of Walpole's speeches, published in 1959 by the English Historical Association. Of special value is Charles Whittlesey's volume in the New Scholia (1961) of excerpts from Walpole's letters which were discovered in the 19th century. I have added an index to the books with Walpole's work.","token_len":233,"entropy":[7.8908,11.4429,9.6058,4.7099,8.3224,10.6188,2.7379,11.7296,4.4221,5.3302,2.2464,5.1787,3.918,0.9187,1.2167,3.2526,2.4205,3.5816,3.097,6.024,0.2093,0.8964,4.5616,0.4069,8.7807,7.5194,10.3683,4.1844,0.7975,10.6456,1.9942,2.6249,2.4971,6.0529,2.3464,0.0013,3.9456,1.7389,6.9618,2.8352,0.2157,2.314,1.1631,2.0891,0.7641,1.1968,0.2273,3.3592,0.4105,1.0843,3.1124,4.7359,5.3223,1.3468,2.0216,0.9855,0.756,3.8137,1.0614,4.0409,0.3117,2.7138,5.4863,3.7526,6.3906,0.1742,2.9673,0.4278,2.2893,6.8371,0.0603,0.0386,4.3829,1.5945,3.8631,0.1487,7.0553,2.4758,2.9411,3.2601,1.1506,4.319,1.9535,0.0888,0.004,0.6186,8.7649,7.8285,5.1973,2.9371,4.7735,4.5052,0.9647,1.9163,4.5824,2.876,1.241,1.5138,2.2915,2.227,3.1675,2.0496,0.2988,3.6086,1.2759,9.0786,3.0531,5.0272,0.6609,1.8716,8.2837,1.8237,4.2398,1.9074,6.1941,0.6632,4.3348,3.0652,0.8785,0.001,1.2569,4.7165,0.0023,2.3853,4.2301,2.6452,1.5973,6.7134,0.5155,2.3115,1.1837,3.4158,0.0019,0.6944,0.6743,0.05,1.4694,1.3059,6.2207,5.5489,2.7062,2.373,5.2822,2.7854,1.4263,4.0663,7.4922,4.1987,0.8639,0.8149,6.4352,8.3992,6.9324,3.8986,6.2906,4.4958,1.846,2.6897,4.015,0.1475,0.0006,3.2264,1.2212,3.4237,0.4115,1.4383,4.0789,1.3166,4.7651,0.0018,0.3923,5.4733,1.7533,2.7798,0.5244,4.3304,1.4592,1.1672,5.1329,2.1321,1.7389,0.9528,6.4476,4.4567,4.7579,1.4899,7.0878,6.7556,1.6518,3.782,0.6761,0.5314,5.7371,4.0365,2.7397,6.8159,8.3421,5.6934,3.7254,1.5919,2.63,1.2685,1.1786,7.1938,0.3776,2.0037,0.003,0.1108,2.6668,4.1215,1.7783,6.2699,0.9073,1.6391,5.2014,0.0353,0.1732,0.9274,4.429,1.1347,3.6574,3.3114,4.3499,1.0495,0.9654,4.8383,4.7119,3.1994,0.0037,0.3278,6.1266,1.4777]}

{"id":2434,"ended":true,"length":226,"text":"Since its origins in the Bronx during the 1970s, hip hop music has been associated with noise. Author Mark Katz explains that `` for the pioneering hip @ - @ hop DJs, noise was not just a stylistic device but an organizing principle. `` For example, when DJs spun a hip @ - @ rap record, they would lower their records so that the grooves would skip through the record (a technique known as `` s @ - @ p @ - ing ). By creating the sound of a records jumping through the grooves, these DJs provided a powerful rhythmic component and a chaotic atmosphere to the music. In addition, they manipulated records so that they played two songs simultaneously, which created an effect similar to that of a clap or clanging bell. In the course of performing as a DJ, those artists may have developed some of their most distinctive and recognizable sound effects. As we will see below, these sound effects -- which have since become popularly associated with hip hop -- are the result of DJs using sound equipment to both create and manipulate sound. In addition, these sound effects also include the use of sound as a vehicle for creative performance techniques.","token_len":233,"entropy":[5.5743,4.9597,1.417,1.4014,7.4682,5.0729,0.2044,3.6438,0.1022,0.1626,7.5702,1.6724,4.4387,0.7073,1.7921,4.6967,0.0467,9.4062,2.6114,11.4149,4.8312,8.8282,3.9714,1.7146,13.3801,10.5457,2.1533,8.4999,2.0224,15.9082,8.2699,6.2833,8.0812,7.2055,0.9955,3.2115,1.0479,3.1912,2.0776,0.6748,7.412,0.1089,3.7364,1.6035,1.8291,6.0194,0.7711,1.7924,7.5069,4.1074,2.4075,0.0597,3.2177,4.3914,8.7483,2.4362,5.2951,6.1367,1.1703,0.1903,3.8829,3.014,0.9716,1.2469,2.3229,8.2871,1.6659,6.9208,2.9786,0.6527,1.2953,6.8752,0.0869,1.899,7.8306,2.7126,0.8149,2.9402,5.1426,3.9465,2.4596,1.2481,0.0465,3.4989,7.5705,9.7478,1.0182,1.3783,6.9177,2.8166,2.442,7.4629,3.4207,4.5258,3.9875,2.575,3.5486,0.355,1.5689,7.4155,11.1506,1.9809,0.9698,4.6863,0.0219,0.4899,3.7995,0.7618,5.608,0.9973,3.8175,5.0903,0.0002,4.6527,4.3477,2.4297,9.3412,4.7816,2.0942,0.8967,1.3262,0.7016,2.9139,2.6238,0.32,2.8589,7.7777,5.8494,2.7214,0.1871,0.9627,4.8494,7.6232,3.8871,1.8354,1.5183,2.7201,3.7305,1.9418,4.0998,2.4724,0.027,1.9269,0.4499,1.1454,7.0965,1.5877,3.1944,2.9956,6.6944,6.3831,1.0402,2.6309,1.9107,6.8326,0.0007,4.9891,6.3885,1.3165,0.9109,0.335,5.6885,4.9627,5.2693,0.451,5.3738,4.7077,1.0901,2.4433,4.1869,2.3618,2.338,4.5632,2.2236,2.4342,1.4693,4.0247,4.2272,2.7875,0.4772,2.4664,0.0373,2.4857,2.9363,0.1047,7.5265,2.6297,3.0409,3.8636,1.4426,3.4713,6.502,3.5775,0.0354,1.3894,0.1769,0.3718,1.597,3.8776,2.6268,0.0132,5.2112,2.7952,3.0356,5.6183,1.6482,7.6574,1.9022,0.8585,1.3491,2.359,0.9288,2.7336,2.3227,0.4606,3.0099,1.0891,0.0896,3.4988,3.4155,1.994,1.1089,0.0114,3.2261,5.6443,0.4456,5.6474,0.5172,3.3591,4.8402,5.9056,0.9051]}

{"id":4494,"ended":true,"length":208,"text":"The duration of Unas'reign is uncertain. As indicated above, historical sources credit him with 30 and 33 years on the throne, figures that have been adopted by many Egyptologists, who have assumed that the 30-year period refers to the First Dynasty. This assumption, based mainly on the fact that, unlike Tutankhamen, Unas had no son, has recently been challenged, by an Egyptian archaeologist, Ahmed Mostamoun. He notes that Unas may have had a wife, thus necessitating the existence of a son, and hence a 20 year period during which Unas could have reigned consecutively, and not necessarily 30 years in all. Based on this assumption, the 30 years Unas held the throne would have had to be spread over 10 periods of 20 years each, as opposed to 20 periods of 30 years each. In order to do this, Mostamoun proposes extending a period during which the throne was vacant to include the reigns of King Piankh and his brother King Menes. These two were presumably rulers who ruled more than one dynasty independently of each other and whose reigns do not appear in historic sources.","token_len":234,"entropy":[10.0835,0.2988,11.0277,8.3083,9.7129,10.4937,2.3447,5.8839,1.0488,4.5481,5.734,1.9185,0.1355,9.8796,4.9945,8.8258,3.6395,0.3601,7.6497,5.9013,4.9867,1.6245,3.8833,0.7216,5.8262,0.9029,9.7496,1.542,2.8327,1.0359,7.6219,0.9375,2.9128,10.3041,0.0611,2.4833,3.2232,2.0497,5.1022,0.9657,1.8022,5.8234,0.8485,0.1022,1.6978,5.3458,0.2164,0.6976,6.965,0.9968,1.166,3.4022,4.3937,2.5803,3.3385,5.6442,0.0555,1.3352,3.2079,0.0104,4.6292,4.3986,7.0252,0.0541,0.0001,3.93,0.4527,3.402,0.0049,3.7942,2.2176,6.252,1.0316,3.197,6.1369,0.2675,2.5131,3.0957,2.956,3.8908,1.3391,4.2526,0.0117,1.0481,6.6522,8.8104,4.6512,7.2481,1.3623,2.9762,4.6061,0.287,1.9131,0.0063,4.8883,0.2191,2.626,1.4389,3.4492,1.2452,7.5139,6.4093,0.0073,1.8214,4.7676,0.0088,0.6791,2.3125,1.6938,2.1374,6.1802,2.8319,6.9591,2.2221,1.0651,5.134,0.0544,2.7861,0.01,2.1817,1.1264,6.616,0.1705,9.3466,0.0003,2.4767,2.9768,4.7267,4.0957,5.8454,0.6612,4.2567,3.8007,0.8685,5.976,0.0924,1.5842,2.5365,0.1072,2.0674,3.8207,3.0887,5.5907,0.0029,2.9413,1.4948,0.2796,2.524,0.9489,4.1361,1.4577,0.6386,9.4721,0.6274,3.9511,5.6551,1.8721,5.5945,0.2901,5.0594,1.1209,3.6544,3.1742,0.0011,3.9153,4.3906,0.5477,2.0754,0.5045,1.4882,0.869,3.3998,3.5128,0.1245,5.2444,0.3571,0.1783,6.3128,0.0014,0.0002,4.2271,6.8531,4.5444,1.3985,5.8925,0.0223,1.5766,5.0877,1.5993,3.8233,1.604,3.699,1.3414,2.8035,2.2748,0.1441,3.853,4.8414,9.4318,8.3378,1.5855,3.1413,3.0691,4.1309,6.0584,3.252,1.5106,4.4257,2.0765,4.3788,6.1559,5.9282,2.6995,3.5577,5.5009,0.5032,2.1985,1.9269,7.6561,0.9927,0.4236,0.0106,3.2136,3.7763,2.8193,0.6602,6.4381,0.0624,2.9505,1.0079,8.3021,2.4884,0.4087]}

The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with meeting the energy needs of the US than what form a dam should take, ordered that the river wall be built in the same manner throughout. This gave rise to the problem of having to decide which of the earlier plans did conform with the new standard. The concrete dam was built with a stepped face to avoid the glaring, monotonous mass, but the plan for the steel arch was abandoned, and a uniform rectangular dam of concrete was substituted. That decision became increasingly unpopular as time went on, and the U. S. dam industry gradually fell behind that of Japan in the technology.\n\nThe US dam industry never embraced the possibilities of making its dams self -sufficient and self -propelling.

{"id":4640,"ended":true,"length":210,"text":"Harvey formed in the central Atlantic, reaching hurricane strength only a few hours after first becoming a named system on September 12. From its initial position several hundred miles east of the Leeward Islands, Harvey slowly moved northwestward, reaching hurricane status by the time it made landfall on the coast of Louisiana on August 25. However, due to an upper-level outflow, convection only developed in Harvey's eyewall on August 24. On the day of the hurricane's landfall, the steering currents were too weak to allow for forward motion, so Harvey tracked across Louisiana as a tropical storm, despite winds and rain of 90 to 110 mph (150 to 175 km\/h). Following landfall, Harvey had an overall track that trended to the west-northwest for the next several days as a cold front passed to its north. The system then turned west on September 2 as a ridge of high pressure to the north of Harvey pushed the system to that more westerly track. A strong extratropical ridge of high pressure built over the U.S. eastern seaboard beginning on September 7, and Harvey was absorbed into the ridge on September 9.","token_len":235,"entropy":[8.4691,11.2576,3.8879,2.82,8.6429,6.8712,2.3217,6.673,9.0721,2.1406,4.9608,2.4497,0.3026,2.5936,0.5547,7.306,4.9202,1.5052,8.7407,8.8078,2.8536,3.2629,3.3252,0.9462,5.6672,3.4306,2.7831,2.4499,7.6501,2.3606,0.3714,2.731,0.2177,1.5105,8.994,0.5823,0.0035,0.0561,0.4259,1.2192,6.1479,1.9608,3.8194,0.6279,1.9739,3.0008,1.346,5.3219,2.945,1.131,2.0646,0.7062,3.9912,0.0261,1.3763,1.5104,3.2653,0.1678,3.0784,0.6636,2.8668,3.4681,0.2923,4.9958,0.0406,4.5006,0.0152,4.2461,5.8205,1.5114,0.8022,7.794,0.1025,1.5795,9.2078,0.4037,7.6986,5.1475,2.4704,4.7705,0.3134,10.1346,2.0738,0.1601,3.3244,1.1646,2.8963,1.1949,3.7258,2.5729,3.081,0.7797,1.996,1.0797,1.688,0.7479,0.3524,1.5342,9.008,5.9048,2.608,4.3091,1.4843,0.417,3.4978,2.4527,8.0805,2.8877,1.7629,2.2558,1.1817,6.9146,5.1254,3.7517,3.6843,2.9849,3.4216,0.7265,1.5055,7.3977,6.4222,3.872,2.4524,3.9051,6.0103,2.1475,2.4865,0.3266,2.9652,4.1406,0.0301,2.4054,1.1425,0.1237,0.0036,0.6482,5.5362,2.673,0.447,0.7503,4.795,3.4699,4.8784,3.7537,4.4157,9.6973,0.147,2.8435,1.9517,2.0331,4.6696,0.2457,0.0161,3.608,1.7858,0.9375,2.87,0.3288,4.0137,2.742,6.0935,0.2936,4.1073,5.7292,3.5338,2.4667,0.9172,2.0014,4.651,3.3822,3.6889,2.2563,3.7975,1.0281,3.4948,4.3662,1.1121,6.1564,1.794,2.6124,0.7436,6.5368,0.5625,2.1127,2.6993,1.4917,4.5511,1.9163,1.0922,2.9105,6.6252,7.4063,7.8147,0.0481,0.001,4.1079,0.7538,4.0269,3.8483,10.1457,0.008,0.0056,0.0317,2.3865,2.8534,1.1697,0.0903,5.7645,2.5095,0.6624,6.8754,0.035,0.0044,0.1907,4.717,2.614,0.0014,0.0013,5.5467,1.2606,0.2468,2.7648,1.2364,2.2935,4.4582,2.8772,8.2323,1.9895,0.4627,5.7932,1.8572,0.2979,1.8843,0.6527]}

As the island was small a few years after the arrival of the first residents, there was no space to build the house that would later become the home of the British Governor, and all settlers had to live in the Governor's house, which was also where the prison was built.","token_len":236,"entropy":[5.7977,7.2019,4.0475,6.7247,4.2736,11.2206,10.0708,3.9449,4.7115,0.1953,4.2456,5.0139,9.9898,0.11,0.0033,5.0404,14.9138,3.8414,0.0125,1.7106,5.5933,4.5787,8.4425,5.5703,3.9039,6.1353,1.85,14.301,3.2053,13.8295,2.5742,1.8051,3.9392,11.0956,1.9031,5.47,1.2402,1.2248,1.9579,0.5678,2.9209,2.0514,0.6464,0.7545,1.0654,2.1429,2.8335,4.7693,1.2612,8.4289,0.9519,0.0014,1.523,2.3094,2.5584,6.4534,1.825,3.8341,4.7946,3.0407,5.8666,0.7766,5.5608,6.3108,7.4687,2.7215,1.1597,2.7924,5.0131,5.0403,4.0932,0.7323,1.3123,4.7981,1.4905,4.9803,0.1326,4.2394,3.8916,0.4192,6.8191,9.5809,8.6198,0.0055,7.0428,5.3056,3.8037,0.9674,7.1653,0.883,5.1693,2.6009,2.7856,6.5586,0.0839,5.2067,7.8531,1.2858,0.3138,0.4975,4.051,1.505,1.7287,2.5684,4.098,4.5979,2.205,5.5875,7.0854,5.3285,1.8563,0.0722,6.2353,0.6522,3.691,0.5255,7.0321,1.6408,7.5679,0.5798,1.0408,1.8211,4.5362,1.4475,6.0265,3.2882,0.283,4.2323,5.545,4.0714,9.9519,3.6688,1.1985,2.5764,6.4886,3.8478,2.0688,5.7349,2.8559,1.2593,1.2551,4.9855,4.7486,0.8769,2.1894,2.0432,3.3007,1.0404,1.5719,1.663,5.7409,5.6668,1.4188,5.4606,5.0861,6.2751,3.3989,7.2215,6.1414,2.0397,3.0351,0.0975,4.4744,3.6893,0.3117,3.537,2.3343,6.4574,4.4036,0.7143,5.4607,3.8568,0.6461,4.866,0.2304,0.0922,2.7304,5.0318,1.2387,4.3019,1.2131,2.6344,1.7459,4.7549,6.2449,2.3141,3.935,2.6913,0.7693,2.2001,0.0409,0.4495,2.8689,9.0855,0.6995,3.618,0.9485,2.6763,6.7046,1.6154,2.9527,3.1321,5.2697,3.3721,1.6945,4.0124,0.8175,0.8139,3.9805,0.1721,0.8291,5.6122,5.598,1.9496,4.7993,5.1915,5.1444,2.9681,0.0823,3.0912,0.8376,1.6327,10.26,0.0885,1.9104,2.3453,1.8943,0.6894,3.6753,4.086,0.8431,6.8485,1.1936,1.0718,0.272]}

The remaining wine cellar on the fourth floor of the building will be turned into a tasting and learning center. Jaronik will create an innovative educational platform for local students that will focus on wine and agriculture. Once the educational facility is completed, the wine cellar will be available to the public on a limited basis to taste and learn about wine.

The other main group was the Missouri, also known as the White River Indians, of the Nebraska region.\n\nIn the 19th century, the name Wolf Pawnee was generally used to refer to the Skidi, and the White River group and the Missouri Indians were known as the Pawnee Indians. From the 1830s through the 1860s, the Pawnee were constantly struggling with the United States and the Lakota, who had also been resisting American settlement. The Pawnee people fought on various fronts : in open warfare with their Sioux neighbors during the Sioux Wars in the 1831-1863 period; in the Battle of Pine Ridge (1895), which finally ended the Oglala Sioux War of resistance against the United States; and during World War I with the Sand Creek Massacre.","token_len":238,"entropy":[11.0108,0.2184,1.3019,3.8193,6.1095,4.2914,1.0781,3.6842,1.7179,3.7153,4.1971,3.4452,7.1286,1.8357,1.2246,5.5424,1.4824,6.7748,0.418,0.159,3.1856,0.0092,0.0808,0.6797,2.9486,5.751,0.2201,2.8768,5.1305,1.0545,2.6988,0.6873,8.0442,10.3841,1.557,2.5239,9.2541,3.3265,0.014,0.6965,0.1826,2.6915,2.3717,0.4596,4.6068,0.0052,3.7416,3.9335,1.6837,0.0569,1.2956,2.6281,3.8148,5.2152,4.4466,5.4721,8.8388,7.1484,4.9228,5.8481,5.0468,0.1283,0.4636,2.0183,8.2206,5.8763,0.1785,4.1802,0.8531,4.6319,0.4145,0.2117,4.4664,0.2829,1.3744,4.5837,6.1725,0.6102,1.055,0.405,7.9159,4.121,4.9951,0.7518,0.0534,0.3578,5.4148,4.5382,3.6639,0.8788,4.4876,1.0909,7.2332,3.1219,0.6076,2.0522,0.0111,2.786,1.3185,3.2059,0.003,0.0601,0.143,1.2006,5.1163,4.4238,0.1152,0.0016,0.1621,0.9553,7.7417,0.7558,1.2747,0.9037,0.0376,1.0128,4.9538,1.9241,1.8307,4.2107,1.7073,4.3234,0.0248,6.7632,5.6966,0.9724,1.447,6.0095,1.044,2.7351,0.3597,0.3771,3.0646,0.0278,0.2434,2.6136,0.5555,5.4862,1.1316,4.6756,0.0273,2.283,0.3145,3.743,0.0015,0.1336,0.885,2.3376,0.0042,0.0809,2.8801,7.5438,6.5648,1.3941,1.3885,7.0021,0.0991,2.4184,1.6869,6.9214,0.0056,2.2435,2.1292,2.2076,5.3891,1.2808,4.4005,4.0142,3.1779,1.0545,1.6871,2.0314,0.0027,0.0869,3.2911,4.9092,4.3782,5.174,0.6588,11.4721,3.384,7.673,1.4761,1.6163,4.6264,3.6642,2.0092,5.1908,0.1329,4.9246,2.281,2.2449,0.8764,1.9893,6.7009,1.4726,1.2967,7.271,2.423,2.1314,0.4383,1.7634,3.6691,0.0162,4.2857,0.5989,3.8092,0.2682,7.9721,1.7053,2.9347,6.5775,1.2825,1.1917,8.4301,5.7748,0.0016,0.1264,2.7907,1.7575,8.0379,2.0363,0.3805,2.5778,0.0092,0.8428,0.5828,3.8253,4.738,0.0038,0.4966,5.6135,0.3317,9.2243,2.2202,4.4273,2.3696]}

This duet is a common one in German folk songs : two different characters, each one a kind of moral exemplar, facing up against their own troubles through the medium of a love song. Here, we assume the role of the poet who must deal with loss and heartache through poetry, hence the soprano, the vehicle for expressing the poet's passion for the one whom he loves. The poet is often identified with the voice as such, thus presenting us with an interesting double form of expression ; that of the poet and that of the singer. The soprano line is then usually presented as the one in conflict, and the vocal colouring of the lines is often a sort of a counterpoint to that of the poet. The soprano is the heart that is in pain, the one who experiences loss and heartache, who sings about the sorrows of love, that is, the one who mourns.","token_len":239,"entropy":[2.6222,7.2602,7.5071,0.7179,10.443,17.6899,16.6837,3.3594,5.9546,4.3013,4.9969,10.225,9.6995,6.0996,3.9194,7.2484,12.67,2.4628,11.7278,1.8762,4.17,1.3811,3.6015,3.5226,7.3811,1.6067,9.6904,2.126,7.9911,7.2693,11.0748,2.3235,2.8789,4.1262,1.7004,8.0352,1.9393,3.9511,1.3151,7.6888,3.0551,0.6097,5.3291,6.7622,4.9808,0.349,6.4723,0.929,0.0079,1.7993,3.3068,8.9643,0.0347,1.0963,2.949,4.8875,2.2847,1.3117,3.1124,3.2772,2.402,7.0809,6.5011,5.2396,5.6629,2.0963,3.56,3.6379,2.9601,5.4568,0.0414,7.8082,6.4162,0.1044,1.3624,8.6108,4.7388,2.1303,3.6557,1.4825,6.8063,7.4186,1.6007,6.0636,0.0467,2.3768,5.0762,2.4849,0.6536,4.8555,1.7912,3.592,7.698,1.4345,3.595,0.0326,1.2029,4.8578,3.2437,6.089,5.1394,0.1955,7.9137,1.15,6.7583,0.4852,4.1851,5.8319,1.2371,7.541,0.7673,4.93,0.0044,0.0084,2.182,2.5896,9.3703,1.535,5.4132,1.5999,4.2962,0.098,5.4073,1.6564,1.4937,6.0612,4.6064,0.1216,1.6599,0.8779,1.6245,5.0762,2.0792,3.5957,5.7313,0.1827,0.7874,6.4247,5.4563,4.1721,0.7818,5.112,5.1543,4.2718,0.1547,2.4009,3.8274,6.4054,6.0765,1.0606,4.3983,5.6546,4.3066,1.2688,0.6123,3.3357,4.2263,5.3781,0.0304,0.3288,3.579,0.7632,1.5737,2.8541,0.0009,0.0191,8.2703,1.2709,5.7175,5.5764,4.8303,1.0896,1.975,4.3261,2.8897,8.3794,2.2011,2.3669,1.3982,4.7519,11.1168,3.5164,1.8492,0.2654,3.1959,1.377,2.1242,3.2355,5.1674,0.0055,5.1043,6.238,1.5089,0.6597,2.9626,0.8007,0.1219,4.0109,0.8134,1.497,2.3994,0.0031,0.0196,1.6084,3.0866,6.771,4.599,1.8474,3.2059,5.0821,0.9337,2.0791,2.9586,1.0113,6.2759,3.8402,1.3215,2.0038,0.0106,1.6826,3.8127,3.8064,3.7374,1.4567,4.1102,1.2116,0.7012,4.6974,1.435,5.1111,0.9799,0.7748,1.107,2.1523,0.3185,6.1894,0.0035,3.2431]}

The balance of power had been transferred from the Senate to the army ; as such the emperor of Rome took upon himself the direction of foreign affairs. Moreover he was much stronger than before, because the Romans were disinclined to a struggle with an army in time of peace.\n\nAfter Caracalla's death ( AD 249), Rome did not recover the lost power. The senate was again reduced to a subservient role, and the power of the chief magistracies and ecclesiastical departments devolved on the emperor.\n\nAfter Caracalla's death two rival emperors were recognized by the Roman senate. The first emperor that was recognized as successor was Licinius ( AD 249). The senate was forced by the emperor to make him his successor and to surrender its powers. Licinius was a Roman aristocrat, but his reign was far from prosperous and many citizens were dissatisfied with his rule. His son Caracalla ( AD 245\/250) followed his father. The senate was forced to recognize him as sole ruler in place of his father, or else face his wrath.","token_len":241,"entropy":[4.7485,0.1653,9.6459,4.4378,1.2517,1.2411,5.8708,3.8889,8.5715,0.3656,2.9327,6.1301,2.9911,0.9389,6.3465,2.6443,0.8952,1.8892,7.2582,0.1383,0.0747,2.0965,0.8141,4.1833,1.4886,0.8355,2.959,0.238,0.1795,7.5874,8.853,5.1633,3.2185,1.3674,6.1381,4.3192,2.6339,5.2392,4.892,0.0936,0.6953,8.0753,0.4876,4.542,0.5448,1.0104,6.1088,2.9441,1.8405,4.7875,5.7433,0.7353,3.1869,1.2855,4.4626,2.2556,4.7789,1.3713,7.1276,1.4254,0.1907,0.0008,0.0648,7.0412,5.9363,0.8791,4.9264,2.1024,4.0277,6.0779,0.1515,1.7837,0.7757,3.2704,0.0029,4.0619,1.1511,0.0021,0.0002,0.883,0.7013,5.997,8.9954,6.486,4.2218,5.0793,5.142,0.4214,6.0277,1.5908,4.9881,3.3097,2.2374,1.6243,2.1027,1.8657,3.9272,3.9709,0.1442,1.2605,6.063,0.696,0.0058,2.477,1.2051,1.2647,1.1921,4.6566,0.2909,0.3084,6.8743,3.4091,1.7736,3.8406,1.5132,3.6948,6.385,0.3785,5.3211,7.9907,0.0146,2.381,0.4385,1.0425,0.8147,2.5832,0.0003,3.6513,1.0049,0.0022,0.0006,0.2587,0.2209,5.8145,6.1021,5.0433,0.0404,2.1513,7.6015,1.5348,0.4855,2.5079,1.5658,1.1588,1.2135,1.3612,2.0489,8.4579,2.3892,2.7363,2.9998,5.0138,2.3769,8.1231,0.1843,0.016,3.5353,2.6428,2.6407,2.6641,1.6104,4.4557,2.0293,5.5987,3.8023,1.0254,2.8613,0.4827,4.3725,2.9928,5.1058,1.85,2.8723,1.6332,5.7207,2.7446,3.8563,1.4207,3.1371,0.0033,0.0019,1.566,3.4643,3.7682,5.064,0.0209,1.2525,2.2049,1.886,4.6212,0.6768,5.4272,0.4979,3.7829,2.0292,4.7175,5.2834,1.4841,3.4449,0.3357,0.6195,1.2291,0.1605,3.4489,2.5429,5.875,0.2518,0.0162,1.661,0.5022,5.3078,7.1277,4.909,1.0404,5.5547,1.8575,0.6322,3.2101,2.1844,3.1017,1.8004,3.2019,0.2364,4.346,1.2203,0.3987,6.9647,2.4437,3.5784,6.6544,0.0268,2.0243,1.4088,1.2697,5.8605,1.7279,5.0767,4.304,6.3452,0.4872]}

Braatz argues that Galland's plan to counter the Soviet Union was flawed. Although he admits that L\u00fctzow's opinion was crucial, his ideas, while valuable, could have only been implemented after much delay. He is also critical of Luftflotte 1's operational concept : the bomber force was too concentrated against the Soviet Union and the fighters were too dispersed, especially, in the early months of the war.\n\nL\u00fctzow was not happy to have to fly reconnaissance missions, he preferred attacking industrial centres, but did so if it had to be done. During his time as an observer and leader of fighter forces, he came to understand the Soviet Air Force ; one of his ideas was to equip a Soviet air base with P-36 Fighters and to send L\u00fctzow as an observer in order to get more information and understand their tactics. At this time, L\u00fctzow started working closely with the German Army General Walter Model, which brought him to the attention of Hitler.","token_len":241,"entropy":[8.063,7.4603,0.2069,6.7442,5.2314,4.3816,7.0118,1.9378,7.2187,0.8234,1.2893,5.6323,0.2602,4.9215,8.3891,7.1707,2.6206,8.181,4.3907,1.9826,2.6758,8.7523,3.9225,10.3396,6.0641,5.9429,7.9644,2.9157,4.5098,7.7892,1.9773,10.2004,10.4405,2.1773,9.9822,6.4558,1.5563,11.3674,5.3537,11.6066,0.1355,3.9151,0.0025,1.6229,6.1349,1.727,6.5258,1.0773,4.0491,1.5616,1.2938,4.6714,1.6909,4.9029,1.8362,4.0527,0.4662,4.1654,0.0035,0.0004,0.0014,1.2692,7.5183,0.9494,8.8908,1.6332,3.6446,6.4473,4.3193,3.1555,4.733,0.3619,4.0159,2.89,4.6156,0.3733,2.864,3.731,5.7158,5.7971,0.8007,2.4623,4.0922,2.3685,2.7714,0.0337,8.2348,0.0228,8.8961,7.9012,9.2464,1.739,6.2029,6.1822,9.3238,3.1194,6.7268,6.8422,1.7667,3.9092,6.7934,5.2939,0.9434,2.106,0.2863,1.9302,2.2838,5.9567,1.0076,0.4888,4.383,2.3863,4.6427,6.8047,2.6417,1.0832,3.8055,2.9656,0.5219,0.8496,0.2751,0.9957,2.7526,0.3125,2.8985,0.026,0.0005,0.0015,3.0653,3.1644,4.3655,3.7043,3.7116,2.3893,5.7916,6.1414,0.8346,2.894,4.2764,7.4067,7.3608,9.0317,4.9103,2.0635,2.746,4.3631,4.3418,6.2922,2.9378,4.348,1.2894,2.1503,0.7646,1.4253,4.6978,1.9493,2.069,1.7221,3.0027,3.6785,3.4783,5.7665,0.5067,6.0005,3.53,0.7478,0.6602,5.8179,0.4663,2.8306,1.341,3.7958,4.757,0.2136,9.2015,5.0544,0.5089,2.6239,4.8992,0.3687,0.5743,5.5211,3.7241,3.462,2.8645,4.8821,0.8904,6.7596,0.349,3.9917,8.8995,1.9709,2.7848,3.8698,6.335,0.0171,0.0007,0.0016,3.3215,1.7351,0.6564,3.1771,3.0274,0.0201,4.5948,4.0443,1.2462,3.1481,5.0626,3.4135,3.8511,0.256,4.6781,2.9433,0.7226,0.4201,1.6391,0.0033,0.0007,0.0014,6.6402,3.3003,3.6198,0.014,1.4058,3.4777,3.7729,5.1277,7.3617,12.9447,2.0107,4.4188,6.0413,1.1182,1.7518,1.3825,2.1411,0.004,3.0364,0.9794]}

Most battleships got upgraded from 25 @ 12 cm SK L \/ 40 to 32 or 38 cm guns (the latter ones in twin or quadruple mounts); there were some 25 @ 15 cm SK L \/ 45 guns in quadruple mounts as well in some battleships.","token_len":241,"entropy":[5.2243,7.6531,0.3331,4.014,8.4187,1.0953,3.4935,9.4809,12.4616,0.0766,2.2495,1.1273,5.9768,10.1506,2.0626,0.0008,12.2071,7.4205,5.6459,10.2515,10.9697,0.4161,1.3565,3.6507,5.1496,8.6327,5.9643,10.6092,5.3157,5.7079,6.8666,7.113,10.6819,8.686,7.2122,6.8348,7.5643,3.8952,5.6362,11.8395,0.2786,6.0984,0.8642,2.645,3.5058,0.7198,5.324,1.6794,7.2652,0.1248,2.4923,9.6555,2.3958,2.6088,2.5163,3.1971,11.6057,5.8962,5.9927,4.246,2.2897,3.2691,0.0177,8.3375,5.2828,0.7638,6.4165,1.7569,4.1709,0.8724,4.2576,1.5534,3.5339,0.9461,3.3825,3.1291,1.6768,0.9448,3.3914,2.7973,1.763,4.2237,1.2586,3.7833,2.6424,1.61,2.3636,5.3729,2.8228,4.5213,1.8293,4.9095,4.9244,5.3941,0.8601,3.8478,1.5644,5.9387,1.4724,4.31,3.1859,1.3252,5.2767,7.1121,0.2012,3.6054,0.3705,4.8648,2.6924,6.1852,5.3791,2.93,5.9916,3.4801,3.8674,4.1251,1.3874,3.3355,0.0361,4.4629,2.1977,3.0146,8.0012,0.5494,1.334,6.9002,0.6336,0.0027,0.642,8.7,8.4572,0.0131,1.6992,1.352,0.2672,2.6703,0.321,7.301,4.373,0.2527,1.766,0.4564,3.4117,6.7998,2.6943,0.006,5.4306,0.7298,5.3024,2.1951,4.8707,6.0003,5.715,1.6773,2.2235,0.499,0.4969,3.4311,1.1764,2.0164,7.7705,1.1534,0.3655,0.6283,0.6376,3.6317,5.552,3.0524,3.0396,0.3909,0.0278,0.0282,1.5886,0.1808,0.4776,0.6504,11.0199,4.7779,6.1337,1.3589,2.2522,2.5643,0.8294,2.1413,3.4614,1.47,6.5079,5.3393,0.0442,7.87,6.7797,2.5559,3.5008,0.3553,0.7811,0.1818,0.2657,0.0271,0.0177,0.4094,1.7609,6.2777,5.9031,3.4764,4.625,9.8188,3.8795,2.9401,2.732,5.7558,4.0463,4.7197,5.618,3.5502,0.1592,6.5699,4.4269,3.8177,0.5722,3.3499,5.9259,1.0169,4.6097,0.096,0.5685,0.0313,0.0315,1.8423,0.2572,0.8718,4.3899,0.1516,1.187,3.5085,0.1474,5.1714,4.1522,1.4703,0.0128,1.0745]}

{"id":2835,"ended":true,"length":202,"text":"The Manchu name for a shamanic shrine or altar to the spirits is tangse. Because its Chinese equivalent tangzi ( < unk > ) means `` hall, `` it may seem that tangse is the Pasht word for prayer hall. Not quite. ``Hall`` in Manchu has a double sense, usually connected with ``sacred edifice``-as, e.g., in the name tangse ( Manchu for prayer hall). Because the term tangse also means the dwelling place of a shaman, it may also be said that tangse is the Pashto equivalent of mausoleum.\n\nTangse is one of four categories of sacred place. The only other three are mausoleum, tangse daur, and tangse yangza (spirit temple). Tangse daur may be a daur in the ordinary sense, a place to which the spirits enter by a sort of stairway. Tangse yangza is a kind of spirit temple (Pashto: sikhan ). In Manchu, the latter refers not to any place of physical presence but to a complex of beliefs concerning the spirits and their relationship or dependence on human beings.","token_len":245,"entropy":[8.611,7.6614,6.0384,2.9918,3.3698,6.6855,3.1315,6.5149,4.3701,5.4127,3.9467,0.8964,3.7701,2.8683,11.1672,11.1354,2.1121,6.2822,5.0469,6.6369,5.0055,10.9578,5.886,2.4776,11.3752,8.747,5.0899,3.6888,0.9384,1.2405,8.6763,12.3027,3.9873,5.6655,6.5158,3.959,4.2541,2.9635,5.4259,1.7901,0.9986,2.3806,8.7468,4.1505,3.0541,10.592,0.1088,5.3889,6.0386,0.9337,6.5504,3.2682,0.7515,6.048,10.227,4.9924,3.3342,8.3974,0.1423,4.3022,1.7642,4.8057,4.9553,2.0065,6.54,5.1543,0.6918,3.8101,5.2552,0.4333,7.1562,0.167,4.1948,8.3128,4.7998,4.5645,7.1093,0.0886,0.0021,0.4159,2.6703,1.0676,4.9547,11.8954,1.5691,3.2724,7.0265,0.2603,5.3238,3.9085,0.4934,2.053,5.6359,1.4898,3.3305,3.9902,0.7976,4.1883,1.1894,3.287,7.3417,0.7151,0.5773,1.9346,2.3801,0.4935,1.2297,1.8265,1.4783,1.2076,4.4287,2.2907,4.8224,0.4579,0.7193,0.9377,4.329,0.0388,5.6192,6.8215,0.2952,6.935,6.946,0.5281,0.0033,1.2709,2.76,0.021,4.5759,0.6542,1.2361,4.1188,0.0553,3.9865,5.8362,0.4543,2.4898,5.2036,1.775,1.2613,5.7682,0.7084,3.5186,0.637,5.7346,0.0152,0.0553,0.322,0.675,8.132,1.9715,6.1762,7.1257,1.5742,0.3899,0.883,0.0986,4.3461,3.5853,5.4189,1.4852,7.115,6.003,0.3936,2.3949,0.0172,1.8159,0.0082,4.2868,0.678,3.3124,6.2124,1.6706,4.1994,1.2467,7.7598,0.1939,1.1031,3.2673,4.4268,3.5657,3.0567,1.4037,1.5462,4.5442,3.6647,4.5246,6.314,0.0078,7.0278,0.4425,1.48,2.5274,0.0075,0.1711,0.0004,0.0011,1.604,0.9174,5.278,0.0047,6.4351,0.3414,3.6319,5.8575,0.6213,0.3505,2.7168,4.6254,5.1665,4.0395,6.6613,2.5368,3.231,0.0764,0.6907,1.3389,5.6347,3.3107,5.3647,0.8896,4.0097,2.4873,1.8296,6.979,3.5503,1.0429,0.1759,1.3688,6.0003,1.3447,7.4177,5.2475,0.6324,2.964,1.936,1.119,4.6585,7.9064,5.9032,0.6777,4.3198,0.8354,0.4247]}

{"id":4531,"ended":false,"length":248,"text":"In addition to writing editorials, Du Bois continued to produce scholarly work at Atlanta University. In 1909, after five years of effort, he published a biography of abolitionist John Brown. In the United Kingdom, he was a member of the British anti-colonial movement. He helped edit a newspaper that supported Indian independence while a resident of London. His work The Souls of Black Folk inspired a radicalized generation of black American intellectuals. Although Du Bois had never been a member of the NAACP, he helped to found it in 1909. His essay \"The Negro Problem\" led the organization to adopt a radical and militant approach in its dealings with white society. Despite his belief in the importance of voting rights for blacks, Du Bois was himself a slaveholder and in favor of the institution of plantation enslavement ; as he saw it, blacks enjoyed all the benefits of their slavery without any of its burdens. Indeed, while he did much to publicize the horrors of slavery, in many ways he helped the institution that had enslaved him to perpetuate both its abuses and its crimes. His defense of slavery during the debate on the Dixiecrat platform in 1932 led him to be accused of having \"forsaken all loyalty to the NAACP \".

The Times goes on to say : `` As we watch women like Trish and Krystal fight for their independence, we are reminded how much is at stake and that women will always have to do what men say even when it's not in their nature to agree. ``\n\n\"What women are fighting for is autonomy, or power of choice, which, like it or not, is exactly what men want, too, as long as they believe that women are just tools. ``","token_len":266,"entropy":[7.2629,7.7457,4.5698,1.6217,5.7174,0.0172,0.4506,6.4647,1.389,3.907,10.0333,3.4634,8.8759,8.379,2.6454,2.4068,1.931,2.1581,5.2147,11.5835,0.4869,0.3629,4.6844,0.0063,1.6556,3.4659,9.5911,17.8876,4.7242,2.721,4.8917,2.1256,4.6311,1.5819,4.2999,1.5711,4.1107,3.6218,4.1501,0.8554,3.2308,5.0571,0.2393,0.0175,0.0001,0.9852,1.7225,0.0078,2.768,6.4179,0.1539,0.001,8.0703,3.0535,2.1762,2.4273,4.3524,7.4616,4.2042,3.1791,2.4949,2.3885,0.5268,2.198,0.0025,1.8651,2.7066,5.324,4.7373,0.0103,1.5294,5.6278,4.9313,1.8049,8.2318,4.282,6.6099,2.0588,2.4452,2.3719,4.6643,3.0677,1.7745,3.4193,6.1446,0.0012,0.0013,1.7778,3.1672,6.4557,2.2982,0.5604,2.9236,0.536,2.3986,1.2477,3.4124,1.1504,5.2079,1.2218,8.2205,0.0439,4.4127,2.8478,0.5196,3.0361,2.6495,5.1736,0.7837,5.7389,0.4375,4.0353,3.3006,0.0005,2.0999,7.3466,2.1147,2.1994,1.9879,1.8419,1.7108,3.387,4.7273,0.0007,0.1883,6.6587,2.5709,7.2338,0.831,5.3106,4.7957,1.7477,5.1798,10.8114,5.8448,0.9486,3.441,5.3562,5.2853,3.6397,2.1209,4.9678,5.4153,4.2638,0.8653,2.067,10.5151,1.9085,1.567,8.7289,1.6,7.7328,2.5438,2.9308,3.0785,4.8141,2.1182,8.4149,7.0578,2.9306,7.805,6.0155,6.9584,1.372,4.0519,0.0009,0.391,1.9903,2.697,4.08,4.8629,0.1224,0.1842,1.3772,7.8831,1.8572,4.7011,4.4557,3.302,5.5845,5.0324,7.171,2.6491,2.9426,6.1705,0.8584,5.9083,1.6701,1.1823,6.4408,0.8366,2.2559,2.5895,1.1951,2.7022,2.6166,4.3231,0.3136,0.0013,4.1005,3.9416,3.0345,4.6754,1.9215,1.2377,1.9452,4.5381,1.9274,1.8421,4.1667,6.9169,1.1315,1.6891,1.5453,1.4105,3.6459,0.2101,5.4898,0.7121,6.1973,1.1271,4.0562,0.6971,0.0005,4.0333,4.9283,5.5563,2.3095,3.5659,0.2513,0.5308,5.1334,1.1556,5.4384,3.4921,5.6282,2.0168,1.209,3.8498,3.9353,3.5434,5.4323,0.009,0.0105,0.0305,1.0049,7.3025,0.1727,2.414,1.183,2.1088,4.3056,2.4816,3.5973,2.7818,0.0057,1.2905,4.8787,1.5567,1.8423,1.1667,4.4849,5.7471,3.0448,4.0128]}

On 1 July 1814 she was under the command of Capt. Samuel Landon. On 9 April 1810 her crew participated in the bombardment of Havana. The ship was badly damaged during the bombardment and it was assumed that she would be destroyed. Despite this, the ship was able to return to port under her own steam.

The following year she was paid off and broken up in June.\n\nSee also\n\nAdmiral Samuel Landon\nSamuel Landon (1817\u20131894)\n\nReferences\n\nSamuel Landon","token_len":268,"entropy":[9.5047,2.9566,7.8924,8.4108,9.3563,6.5188,3.6454,5.7624,4.307,9.4941,8.6499,5.1495,5.4572,7.8202,3.6268,0.0139,0.0011,5.4782,2.507,0.5995,7.7672,2.9091,3.9725,0.483,7.4958,0.8872,3.8229,1.3412,0.1659,7.6243,6.3698,0.0064,4.5784,2.8572,0.2715,8.8646,6.9681,8.0638,4.1982,3.4737,2.3845,7.9813,9.63,1.2848,4.8879,0.4221,8.415,0.4114,7.8312,6.6823,4.9227,2.8177,4.0495,7.812,0.3504,1.2352,1.7218,0.0644,5.1199,6.7608,0.1531,3.8089,16.4706,0.1002,0.0026,4.2452,2.7424,3.8075,4.6901,3.9736,1.5967,10.6156,0.7745,6.3764,9.514,7.375,1.881,2.3887,0.3782,9.2319,1.4681,1.469,2.1628,0.4582,4.707,1.8744,4.3982,0.4224,1.3841,1.6394,5.8473,3.0783,1.7261,1.3261,3.9051,2.8966,0.3798,1.7571,0.3203,1.7396,3.9417,4.1082,2.1021,2.9349,0.0013,4.311,0.0525,2.0559,0.772,5.2044,0.0207,0.9508,7.016,1.2984,5.257,0.9033,3.7976,2.4447,1.4679,0.7546,4.393,1.3833,1.1018,6.0359,1.8361,0.3162,0.0113,2.3822,0.1503,2.4407,1.0092,0.0222,1.0915,2.6702,3.5713,2.791,0.429,5.0304,4.1096,3.1897,5.6896,0.0379,0.9996,7.0581,0.0564,7.3616,1.5999,2.3447,2.0181,0.8673,5.1215,0.0626,2.5133,0.3356,2.3986,0.9696,4.5277,0.5309,6.4552,0.4957,1.5717,0.9681,0.8504,2.2027,0.9157,5.6933,2.019,0.6557,1.4398,1.2584,0.878,3.0615,0.0052,2.5459,0.3059,2.4601,4.209,2.7261,2.9666,4.3106,2.1425,5.5939,4.2115,2.7183,0.6466,4.1641,0.3089,0.0008,1.5551,3.4749,2.5118,0.0814,1.489,4.659,1.2766,8.142,0.9858,0.5475,7.2985,2.2298,0.4658,0.0117,0.0085,5.0739,5.2635,9.2988,13.8207,1.9096,0.6115,2.4553,0.6288,2.8667,0.1447,6.6501,1.9823,6.4231,1.8418,3.9363,0.1616,0.3059,0.8243,2.6046,2.6139,0.2503,0.9853,0.5503,7.9582,4.1146,2.2538,9.6392,0.5546,1.919,5.1631,2.2302,1.0795,0.0002,6.3413,0.8716,1.4986,0.0003,5.9694,0.0157,0.178,4.4711,0.1891,0.0102,1.6813,23.8028,0.0495,0.1544,0.0068,2.3727,0.3938,4.3281,0.9995,0.3675,6.199,0.4608,1.0646,0.0002,4.9545,0.9727,0.0003,5.4324,0.0071,0.1864,0.0068]}
{"id":1572,"ended":true,"length":253,"text":"A tropical wave came off the northwest coast of Africa on May 20. The wave did not significantly develop as it moved west across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Once it crossed the Caribbean Basin on May 30, the wave entered the eastern Caribbean Sea into late evening.\n\nA large area of showers and thunderstorms has developed off of the southwestern coast of the Caribbean Sea as it heads towards the Dominican Republic and Florida. This area of convection is beginning to organize today as the convection is becoming much more organized, stronger, and more numerous.\n\nThis is one of the larger tropical and subtropical waves of the season due to its high latitude development. This also brings the potential for more tropical development into July.\n\nConditions are favorable because the wave is moving west at about 10 to 15 knots. This allows the wave has ample space to develop further. As we watch tropical development this week and next week in the Atlantic, we should be looking at an area that is moving slowly and will allow areas of showers and thunderstorms to develop around the wave.\n\nThis would lead to more tropical development as the wave moves through the Caribbean, or possibly even up the eastern Gulf Coast and to the north. By the end of the workweek, we will be better able to determine where the wave is going to go.","token_len":269,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,6.3837,6.0729,0.7908,5.9878,0.1818,0.1339,3.906,2.1593,3.9419,3.507,1.4298,1.9872,2.6516,6.0426,0.1446,7.3448,7.8524,3.2514,1.3719,3.2109,2.621,4.0589,0.5395,2.2446,1.2464,2.7182,8.7545,2.6272,1.0725,7.3195,1.0465,2.8763,0.494,4.1711,7.5026,4.038,0.6067,3.6258,0.2073,1.4928,1.1927,6.3132,0.6171,3.2201,2.6392,1.0458,7.1649,9.5564,6.731,1.8428,1.0292,0.0006,3.487,3.8672,4.357,0.3865,11.055,1.8797,2.8063,0.0761,4.3442,3.6408,5.6547,2.6618,0.5773,4.8928,1.3663,0.0417,1.3084,2.3969,2.0034,3.6046,2.2267,3.9364,2.9602,0.6627,4.776,0.012,2.0145,5.2091,0.7841,3.5545,2.3649,2.33,9.9958,0.4125,1.5297,7.8765,0.0159,9.6442,7.4588,1.9338,1.5569,7.9097,0.2859,3.8781,4.5,4.382,1.4647,6.6728,3.0985,6.2818,1.0096,0.2,1.6432,5.2552,0.446,0.9899,0.0003,3.4673,1.6838,3.5175,0.2684,0.1648,6.5534,3.4288,4.2525,0.925,0.0001,0.0003,3.0087,2.458,0.4033,2.6086,5.9845,0.1977,1.3991,3.4882,5.2045,9.6959,0.7128,2.3606,6.4062,3.9697,1.8688,4.4463,0.4422,3.0439,2.918,5.8529,3.0297,10.0015,0.8155,0.692,0.0002,6.8491,2.9628,2.1421,3.1933,6.1873,1.7139,4.7554,1.2379,1.9301,2.4248,3.569,3.5667,3.2726,3.606,0.5722,2.6232,1.6629,2.241,3.8968,1.243,2.3382,10.3286,4.9359,4.314,0.445,2.8014,4.4681,2.3098,3.7692,5.9303,4.581,3.9108,2.7969,4.8888,3.0232,2.9913,1.6262,3.959,3.8515,0.6384,2.2723,0.7604,1.2569,1.9565,1.5535,3.6796,1.8011,4.557,3.7309,2.1879,1.0239,4.9112,4.4324,1.8205,4.5501,5.1701,8.6253,0.9593,6.2295,0.5654,0.1483,0.0246,0.2939,0.5222,5.7708,0.7065,6.3502,0.559,0.4032,0.0002,3.0747,5.644,4.8977,0.2133,1.6646,2.1166,0.3173,2.8513,1.1308,1.651,1.1896,3.9222,0.4559,2.0819,3.628,5.9535,4.108,2.3638,4.3961,1.5841,2.3068,4.2651,1.7645,2.9594,3.7149,0.8505,4.8663,1.2049,6.1616,1.3659,0.943,0.0026,1.2972,9.5,3.8114,0.8176,1.421,1.0661,0.6849,6.2269,1.0615,0.0033,3.7298,2.3787,0.9945,1.5456,1.2905,3.0424,1.2162,2.0021,1.2646]}

Today, Vildanden is one of eight airports that contribute to the economic development of Nor-way.\n\nIn the course of the project, the airport has been modernized and expanded. Today, the airport is Norway's best airport with the largest parking space for commercial and private aircraft and one of the best airports in Europe in terms of comfort.\n\nThe airport has a special lounge for passengers that want to spend the night on their flights.

As these services become more and more popular, it will be more difficult for TV Everywhere and personal device makers to differentiate their services from one another; however, this is likely the trend that we will be moving toward.","token_len":274,"entropy":[3.4603,6.7857,2.8466,4.8236,1.3304,4.1068,16.9069,8.4494,5.3042,15.3881,10.2451,5.3354,2.5701,0.4622,6.7974,3.2307,2.2012,0.9474,0.2853,5.6676,5.3866,0.3646,3.514,5.1548,2.9736,4.9372,7.6542,1.2934,4.282,0.8603,0.1596,3.1725,0.7454,1.5616,2.1579,3.8459,0.1254,2.7836,0.6985,1.275,2.9447,1.4921,4.3895,0.6745,6.2878,5.716,4.3585,2.4203,1.7,2.3486,0.449,3.7786,0.294,0.0049,0.2856,1.4354,2.079,6.3086,1.6106,2.0382,1.1138,4.5458,4.1353,3.2629,1.9345,0.2734,6.1742,2.0049,1.5103,5.299,4.966,2.7059,4.4694,1.406,4.2627,3.7876,2.5959,5.1635,1.1672,4.3384,4.2846,0.1258,3.9468,0.2742,2.1295,1.1297,5.2909,3.8625,0.7861,0.555,0.8039,3.4742,2.5073,1.9321,2.2518,1.9132,6.3672,5.0254,0.0596,1.2907,5.0482,0.8896,3.947,0.0423,0.046,3.3925,6.6089,0.992,3.5175,10.1678,1.587,0.007,0.1101,0.4471,1.1,0.0021,4.1638,3.6654,0.0104,3.9222,3.1585,3.9192,9.2363,0.152,6.6673,4.4699,3.8849,0.0011,1.5131,0.8251,2.1149,0.5454,0.3407,3.0447,5.7333,0.5872,0.2211,2.0719,5.2588,1.484,5.4027,0.1665,0.5073,4.0759,5.3521,1.2937,4.1615,0.8603,2.5882,4.2652,2.0219,4.0547,3.4924,3.2682,4.5771,1.0594,4.5766,1.6253,0.5263,2.5454,0.9943,2.2166,4.0889,2.6421,1.5628,0.361,0.147,1.1874,5.4031,0.9322,5.9885,0.0057,1.6419,1.5099,4.0544,5.632,0.7695,2.9274,2.4168,6.9997,0.1611,0.0037,0.1493,0.4188,2.4305,0.5818,3.7048,0.8094,4.416,1.1597,2.0822,4.0612,4.1905,1.4763,0.099,0.464,0.0028,1.7288,4.6005,0.582,3.5829,5.8762,3.0544,1.283,6.7827,0.0883,0.4635,0.6775,0.0002,3.8144,3.2992,0.1358,3.751,1.9453,2.6583,2.9598,1.9814,4.0735,0.7359,4.6392,0.3992,2.6768,1.3075,1.8787,1.4257,3.3263,4.2257,4.8818,3.6583,1.4697,2.7218,4.7934,0.7246,0.9129,1.1042,3.7189,0.0121,1.261,0.2808,2.7716,0.7393,0.793,2.3401,0.7846,0.314,2.5012,0.9187,4.0595,2.6715,2.9065,3.4399,0.0831,4.103,2.3025,2.1266,0.8273,3.0907,0.0013,5.606,2.5999,0.0346,2.8317,1.7453,3.0321,3.5864,5.1969,1.7439,4.0806,0.7396,3.5629,2.5256,1.4627,2.218]}

{"id":1123,"ended":true,"length":242,"text":"Because of the xenon atom's large, flexible outer electron shell, the NMR spectrum changes in response to surrounding conditions, and can therefore be used as a probe to measure the chemical environment within a material. As shown, the chemical environment of a given atom can also change, thereby changing the strength of the emitted NMR signal. This experimental method, combined with the knowledge of an atom's NMR resonance frequency, can be used to deduce the structure of a material from the strength of its NMR resonance signal. This technique, however, is not completely sensitive because the resonant frequency of the NMR spectrum of an atom is determined by its electron distribution. As a result, the strength of an atom's NMR spectrum is not sensitive to the total number and size of its electron cloud. With the advent of atomic resolution X-ray diffraction, however, a chemical environment of the molecular scale can be quantified much more precisely. X-ray diffraction in many cases is more sensitive and more powerful in providing atomic-level information than its NMR counterpart, even in materials that also have an NMR spectrum. This principle, known as the 'dual-measurement principle', and demonstrated for the first time in the 1950s by L.A. Bressler and C.A. Anderson, is still relevant in many fields today.","token_len":275,"entropy":[2.828,1.2492,11.3138,6.961,8.2347,2.0536,4.9783,4.1879,5.6339,3.74,6.7621,2.5599,0.3209,1.6474,7.0255,2.8968,4.6212,6.298,3.0935,3.2323,0.0093,7.9031,2.9929,1.9516,1.8267,4.6817,3.0709,0.688,1.5106,1.7667,0.4199,5.5781,1.9487,2.2018,0.9005,4.0584,5.4312,3.0956,1.4308,5.1637,0.3846,4.3064,3.3049,3.9191,1.3233,5.5803,1.5252,1.5948,1.431,5.8233,3.3143,1.7487,3.6225,2.2432,3.1626,6.7693,2.9391,0.4917,6.1501,0.3245,0.5752,6.7022,3.4763,0.0021,1.3446,0.4791,2.7835,5.8842,2.7795,3.2948,4.456,0.0007,0.9583,6.0311,1.2381,5.1069,4.214,0.2471,5.218,0.0069,6.3284,3.1709,0.4915,1.4756,1.0928,0.2492,0.2029,7.4625,0.0019,0.6276,4.4485,0.5392,1.7299,1.5955,3.2218,1.3181,7.0884,0.2241,1.4922,2.045,0.0018,3.1468,2.08,0.3661,2.9443,3.4762,2.3985,2.3545,0.0198,1.4363,1.6496,5.0188,6.0724,4.7157,1.1764,4.8733,0.6484,1.7753,0.6939,0.74,2.2117,0.0013,1.7182,4.3245,2.6227,0.1734,1.0522,3.3543,0.4304,1.4799,3.8245,4.7593,0.9951,3.8058,0.9663,0.1812,0.0522,1.1675,4.1535,0.0894,2.0378,0.7556,0.4263,0.4958,0.0007,1.7143,1.5839,1.8958,4.4065,0.5373,1.1887,6.8788,2.5292,5.0972,3.0998,0.0097,2.0622,2.3755,8.7788,1.0679,5.7225,1.2738,4.9636,0.0049,3.9839,6.168,9.0242,0.2698,0.1608,1.8186,0.0125,1.9924,2.3341,0.0017,3.2595,5.4936,3.7953,2.8269,1.7972,5.5712,2.2459,1.1312,0.1789,4.9072,0.1767,6.4418,0.4018,1.445,0.917,4.3647,0.0076,0.16,0.2209,0.0166,4.4801,5.7171,3.3595,1.6392,4.1496,1.3274,4.5903,2.7751,4.6947,4.6199,4.4149,5.5162,4.7374,2.7131,1.2429,1.6801,4.6267,7.2332,0.011,3.0511,1.6155,4.8303,2.1837,3.9574,1.785,7.2891,1.536,2.683,2.2924,0.011,2.0845,0.6058,2.5696,6.948,2.3903,2.9675,0.0313,1.8438,3.4749,7.0869,0.4537,1.4407,4.6194,0.2818,2.1231,1.3856,0.3023,6.0986,5.6999,3.2393,1.3792,1.7609,0.0047,0.6618,1.4261,6.2905,0.2743,1.9036,5.69,2.0261,4.1196,0.1197,5.0625,5.7866,1.468,1.7333,3.775,0.0175,2.9381,0.0323,6.1722,0.3956,1.9571,3.8534,3.5172,1.7605,2.5756,3.5433,2.5072,0.446]}

Wolfe had devised a firing method for stopping French column advances in 1755 that called for the centre \u2014 in this case, the 95th Rifles \u2014 to fire first. Once stopped, the rest of the column turned and faced off the attack, while the left of the line charged in mass to overwhelm the French position.\n\nThis time, the British lines had no choice : the French guns opened fire with a devastating volley that overwhelmed the British line, killing, stunning, scattering, and causing hundreds to run into the open. Once the line fell back, the French opened up with rifle fire and then quickly charged, only to be stopped short by the 95th Rifles.\n\nThe French commander and his staff watched as the British fell back to the town, their position shattered.\n\nMeanwhile, at a field hospital just outside Quebec City a British surgeon was performing emergency surgery on a wounded captain. The captain was the first person he had ever cut in service. As he watched him die, all he felt was anger at the French. His father fought with Wolfe at the Battle of Didsbury in 1745. He was named after Wolfe. His grandfather had died at the age of 16 in 1762.

{"id":1221,"ended":true,"length":257,"text":"The series was given a budget of $ 100 million ( \u00a3 58 million ), the largest both HBO and the BBC had ever devoted to a series. The season was filmed between May and October 2004 in Ireland and Wales. Although production of the series was finished in 2004, the post-production process, particularly the editing of the episodes, kept BBC Two under budget.\n\nIn spite of the large number of scenes featured in this series, the cast recorded all their lines on the same day for a much quicker edit, which enabled the episodes to be shown weekly. The producers also considered using digital effects, but decided against them because of their potential cost and how quickly the quality of them increases.\n\nIn addition to the visual effects, there were also music and sound effects in the series. The theme to this series was composed by Paul Mullins, and its sound effects were supplied by The RSC. The series' first music score was also provided by Mullins. A further song by Mullins was used in the end titles of the series.\n\nThe show featured a total of 30 lead actors, which included three women in a traditionally male-dominated television drama. The series was created by David Mitchell, who is best known for creating the comedy mockumentaries Peep Show (alongside Mark Corrigan, Ed Armiston and Robert Webb) and Mitchell and Webb.","token_len":276,"entropy":[7.6021,2.9888,5.5686,1.1091,5.8586,0.0763,0.7603,11.8827,0.4426,4.6156,9.5136,5.4203,0.2225,2.0584,3.9504,3.7064,10.3188,9.4044,0.036,3.4467,2.035,2.0546,0.3308,6.8438,0.2189,1.0169,1.8233,0.7706,1.9463,6.9068,2.4837,3.6059,3.4188,3.2967,1.4738,2.025,4.0853,2.7776,4.2544,1.6524,4.9737,1.0079,5.7663,5.8936,2.7274,0.4248,1.1106,1.1431,4.9384,0.6198,4.3092,0.2007,1.3959,7.7842,0.265,0.5076,3.5929,4.8807,5.1783,1.5529,2.8783,2.0543,0.6139,2.9579,0.3209,5.9329,8.8247,5.2743,3.928,2.7837,0.7366,1.2908,0.01,2.3067,6.115,0.0081,1.0841,4.5808,3.0613,0.0279,4.8434,4.9661,0.528,3.5757,1.0491,0.1833,1.4592,4.7193,6.6359,5.0645,2.9314,3.8961,2.9856,2.56,4.1874,1.5634,4.0304,2.8541,6.0587,5.9129,5.1086,2.5584,1.9878,4.4955,1.2603,5.5515,0.0618,0.364,3.3494,6.5408,1.1867,1.6884,4.4366,2.0759,4.6657,3.6736,6.2203,3.9258,2.1729,2.8653,3.0081,0.9841,4.1444,1.6834,1.2332,2.2468,4.2309,2.8977,1.9946,6.2362,3.8055,1.4135,6.8345,0.5245,5.7644,8.2161,0.7352,0.9796,0.0002,2.4217,2.7867,0.6826,1.0723,5.8798,0.192,0.533,2.4891,0.544,1.0165,6.3212,1.6056,2.308,0.149,3.4475,0.6161,0.9907,0.6641,1.5279,5.4326,6.1014,1.7356,1.3603,0.5189,8.0729,0.2178,4.8072,5.615,2.0489,0.965,2.8743,5.0712,4.8884,0.9507,0.568,5.7816,0.0697,4.4093,5.2302,7.2391,2.1776,1.4902,2.833,3.5544,3.9033,5.5038,2.7301,0.3074,4.4663,3.0932,0.0357,8.2115,0.0154,1.1824,4.6017,4.8085,4.1529,1.6621,4.8507,0.0117,0.4628,3.0469,1.2725,0.3481,5.9874,9.4641,1.0341,0.4113,1.2243,0.5605,0.5792,0.0001,1.5874,3.652,4.6315,1.7018,4.1458,0.0374,4.6411,8.3823,1.5511,1.127,3.9625,1.4026,3.974,4.7811,3.9363,3.464,7.2704,0.6017,1.3464,0.0625,6.6973,3.9944,1.0568,1.4003,2.1854,1.3948,4.3851,0.8302,3.8141,4.8492,0.8616,1.6212,3.5239,2.0256,0.0638,0.1619,5.2476,1.0178,5.9263,10.8664,0.0709,1.9966,5.8945,1.755,0.1381,2.5255,7.979,1.8543,5.5347,7.9784,1.2971,1.7579,6.1506,8.3113,7.0645,0.7755,4.8542,6.5432,1.0499,0.3365,8.9433,3.275,3.7943,3.389]}
{"id":723,"ended":true,"length":267,"text":"Most of the games in the Guitar Hero series feature a selection of songs ranging from the 1960s to present day rock music from both highly successful artists and bands and independent groups. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is one of these. The game features a selection of rock, heavy metal and hip-hop, along with a few country songs. It is based on the same franchise as Guitar Hero: Van Halen (which featured classic rock). The game begins with Aerosmith's smash hit \"Dream On\", continuing with hits like \"Love in an Elevator\", \"Sweet Emotion\" and \"Gettin' Over You\". There are also some fun songs from more obscure groups like Bad Company, Guns N Roses, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Metallica. The game features two solo modes as well as rock band mode in which multiple people can play a song together. Most of the game's songs are licensed music, though there are a few custom songs in the game (including \"Loser\", \"I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing\", \"In the Air Tonight\" and \"In My Life\"). The game has a few modes, including Expert and Solo, which lets you play songs at your own pace and on a level you enjoy. The songs featured in the game are from the first ten Aerosmith albums and as well as their early singles.","token_len":276,"entropy":[2.9817,0.8519,6.2374,2.8079,1.1268,11.2882,0.047,0.2719,3.8982,2.2572,6.5681,0.0098,3.5167,6.464,0.0614,2.4771,6.7419,0.1077,1.0534,5.2473,0.1489,6.5078,2.7731,4.666,4.9449,9.5713,1.7326,3.1369,0.7167,3.3508,4.5681,7.8393,5.095,0.4017,2.698,0.065,2.4367,12.8958,0.6399,0.0082,1.8643,1.8779,0.188,3.1797,2.0853,2.2077,2.5703,2.0317,1.5636,3.8659,0.0038,5.5965,2.6144,5.5711,0.1008,1.5694,4.2528,0.8501,0.0004,5.6967,2.6596,0.0007,1.6211,3.1187,7.2624,2.0264,1.3702,2.9926,1.7721,4.0332,0.3081,0.5955,5.0962,6.5175,0.6113,0.3276,0.0453,1.7873,7.475,1.1052,0.003,3.2408,3.0944,5.0385,6.0695,1.4381,4.4929,2.0308,0.73,6.384,0.5744,7.4895,0.0057,0.0009,2.0612,7.8356,0.1839,1.1035,6.4016,3.7613,2.5257,8.4977,1.3658,6.7271,0.999,0.0812,5.0295,6.2777,5.5352,4.2639,0.1246,0.8684,0.1628,5.979,7.3627,0.2564,1.3536,0.0519,0.1579,4.6814,7.4178,0.0085,0.5487,4.8531,2.6962,0.6153,4.147,0.4835,1.2118,2.5212,5.9427,2.048,1.291,6.2275,2.6,4.7819,1.5953,6.3131,3.7917,0.6779,5.0638,0.0739,2.8439,0.457,6.135,0.0217,0.4558,7.7952,0.3111,0.0001,1.1005,5.6025,0.0026,0.3385,1.7864,0.7534,2.373,3.6618,5.8695,3.0136,4.527,0.1573,0.5621,8.2992,5.9103,2.5867,4.4697,0.6753,6.6234,4.3287,1.0248,0.7269,3.1973,1.6892,2.2478,0.5548,5.9664,0.3295,0.0569,2.3351,1.2315,1.3344,0.6751,6.4755,3.6994,1.8081,3.2839,1.3669,0.2554,2.2256,0.2108,7.6949,0.6204,3.9608,0.8504,1.3533,4.5232,3.0608,2.3196,4.4405,3.5303,1.6803,0.2192,3.6707,2.7099,0.0039,4.6115,0.0388,5.6572,3.3393,0.9734,0.7693,0.1319,5.2233,1.8321,4.7697,1.3244,1.5947,0.0918,0.2637,5.0117,2.2289,3.6192,0.5986,1.5881,0.8641,2.4197,1.2349,3.6917,6.14,3.2662,1.4872,9.5563,2.9639,2.9181,1.6215,1.0998,5.1153,0.5168,1.2311,2.5401,4.8237,1.914,0.3069,0.0445,1.9897,4.7361,1.9375,5.4533,4.6416,5.0522,0.6871,1.5016,5.0281,5.5664,0.4392,0.5173,0.2079,0.628,4.1619,1.6599,4.2814,5.4931,9.9873,0.0028,0.0011,1.9295,1.863,5.7126,2.7901,0.077,4.5752,5.0407,2.667,1.2514]}

The first weekend number includes a $ 9 million Friday, $ 22 million Saturday and $ 22 million Sunday. The opening was also on-par with the first weekend of Cars, which scored $ 47 million on its way to $ 84.2 million domestically. The Pixar franchise has never opened below # 1 in its opening weekend in North America.\n\nThis is Pixar's worst opening weekend and domestic total in 5 years. That means Disney's only film in the top 5 domestic slots is currently The Simpsons 25th Anniversary, which only had $ 6.23 million this past weekend.

An area of disturbed weather began to organize on August 6. By August 7, the system intensified into Tropical Depression Seven-E. Although it became a much stronger depression on the next day, it continued to intensify while moving westward. On August 9, Tropical Depression Seven-E strengthened into Tropical Storm Aka. At the same time, the system had lost all tropical characteristics and was classified as a tropical sub-cyclone, albeit, it continued to make a very northward and outward turn. The center of Aka was located just south of Taro Island in the Philippines on August 10. Shortly before entering the Philippine Sea, Aka weakened below tropical storm status and was a cyclone as it neared the Japanese islands of Shikoku on August 10. The next day, Aka entered Kyushu where it remained for 24 hours, producing torrential rain and strong wind. After the cyclone moved ashore in southern Japan, it slowly drifted northward due to increased resistance from the land surface. It gradually weakened as it passed over mountainous terrain where rainfall was less intense and only heavy rain fell. As it exited Japan, Aka was a weakened depression and it became a remnant low on August 12. Aka dissipated on August 14 in the Yellow Sea.","token_len":277,"entropy":[9.4959,1.028,1.7385,6.3953,7.0996,6.9632,2.6831,4.2923,3.9318,0.2751,0.9451,5.2259,1.2698,0.8291,5.0967,6.1279,1.5629,3.4792,7.0335,1.9865,6.2564,4.8889,0.7608,10.1899,4.2682,5.9068,0.5781,10.3765,3.1154,3.7718,3.3169,2.9342,5.6214,1.7864,2.4641,0.4417,1.5547,5.3835,6.8637,2.6724,4.1512,4.4437,11.5966,3.6118,5.432,5.7093,4.8032,2.367,4.8136,1.9121,5.6897,2.6528,6.1876,2.4381,3.2099,5.24,0.378,0.2243,0.9645,2.3646,0.3107,3.3575,7.1969,5.3908,3.0081,0.4432,1.4019,2.5918,0.5647,2.4303,0.1895,1.8078,3.3781,1.1352,0.0916,0.0859,4.6025,1.7424,1.2018,1.0208,1.1215,0.0085,0.9374,4.2128,1.5995,0.303,0.0095,0.1613,1.4124,2.287,4.5769,5.2483,4.3341,2.8726,6.4371,1.4963,2.2396,7.2978,0.1785,1.2333,1.2799,6.4274,1.0487,10.3664,0.3702,2.7558,7.2756,5.9885,2.3871,3.1368,0.1082,4.5292,3.3015,5.1061,9.1824,0.224,3.7514,6.645,3.3787,0.8743,2.0129,6.1033,0.2895,5.7611,0.0124,1.5216,3.2658,2.8752,1.6614,0.0343,4.903,6.818,2.7363,2.2426,0.6355,4.9779,4.4149,1.1828,1.9349,0.564,6.1162,2.0163,7.0615,0.8798,4.7093,1.4433,0.2786,2.6964,0.0102,4.7562,6.92,5.2479,1.8266,3.1324,1.3694,2.2587,5.0587,5.346,0.0378,4.8166,1.8018,6.3807,0.0004,0.7844,4.9477,3.2613,0.6946,5.4908,1.5214,0.0281,5.7402,0.2386,3.3295,0.2592,1.7377,4.3633,0.1504,0.2126,1.6232,0.0029,4.3376,9.8852,0.0846,0.0007,5.4363,0.1406,4.3302,1.8777,4.6172,0.1452,2.0627,5.4947,6.0727,0.0267,1.0228,1.3401,3.3796,2.5071,1.075,3.8858,2.2871,4.0931,0.074,3.9857,5.0659,2.3422,5.3283,1.052,0.4752,1.3631,4.7957,3.8895,1.9911,0.3533,6.875,0.0591,4.4556,7.7632,1.0784,1.038,7.2682,4.09,0.8375,3.1053,4.1549,3.1754,3.6003,0.5666,3.8867,1.9817,5.4986,1.8315,4.7184,5.5282,1.4689,3.405,2.8414,1.8956,5.9451,5.2304,1.8931,1.9804,1.5796,4.0471,1.3946,7.4631,1.9293,0.3597,1.6703,0.0024,2.5517,3.0817,7.1165,3.3964,1.8623,3.7548,3.2017,0.566,7.9649,8.4384,3.7885,9.8308,1.776,0.4997,3.0586,0.6035,8.089,0.0015,1.9083,0.5161,1.6472,3.8233,1.0689,6.6476,0.1869,1.2966]}

At night, the Mansion becomes a popular dance club and guests are encouraged to enjoy the show, but do not have as long to enjoy the attraction.","token_len":277,"entropy":[11.4769,0.8367,10.4255,4.4411,3.2803,5.7684,1.4557,3.3361,1.8129,3.8739,6.3683,0.0962,3.6358,3.2082,2.6159,2.9464,1.717,0.1117,2.6845,0.9683,3.4617,2.6209,0.7574,0.1074,4.2967,4.6749,3.4341,1.2543,0.2489,5.5034,1.3068,1.0332,3.1617,1.9327,2.9753,1.1589,3.7901,1.8691,1.7383,1.169,4.2519,4.2508,0.3602,8.7448,1.0998,0.506,4.7285,3.4241,1.9486,2.1872,4.3605,6.4098,2.9744,4.2552,0.2917,5.7735,3.9552,3.026,7.3494,3.0738,0.38,4.4067,2.2932,4.8213,4.7024,2.1448,2.0932,1.532,2.1405,0.8507,0.0306,0.5523,1.1659,0.0069,2.8896,5.0836,0.3005,1.0894,4.323,0.0327,0.9525,3.1147,0.5402,6.8165,1.4219,2.7742,8.2983,3.5817,7.5645,0.0354,5.1848,4.4185,2.7829,1.1706,4.4159,0.6662,6.0455,1.4558,5.5085,1.0062,5.3495,0.2289,3.0738,2.1596,0.1267,0.4955,2.0948,1.3824,0.1897,3.1941,1.0528,0.0002,1.7679,2.6836,0.0192,2.4265,1.7275,6.3349,4.8646,6.1476,2.6002,4.7698,4.2191,9.1884,2.1508,5.1563,0.4742,0.9358,5.457,1.5392,3.5927,4.483,8.8734,5.3539,2.5771,2.9716,0.0053,4.3783,1.9645,4.7088,0.7181,0.1979,4.7449,5.2145,6.0538,7.7734,2.2817,0.5157,0.974,6.5747,0.0392,1.4712,7.704,0.8197,9.6855,0.2308,5.2427,3.2435,3.9592,0.0226,4.7311,2.5111,2.3775,1.4967,0.0002,6.3129,0.8534,6.4648,0.2587,0.2462,0.791,4.7231,0.2125,4.3128,2.432,4.2359,0.2249,1.6071,6.1682,1.1936,0.962,4.7033,4.4531,1.6379,2.6344,0.5605,1.593,0.0002,4.949,2.343,4.4697,0.4671,1.4185,0.6625,1.4425,1.4498,0.0566,0.154,0.5348,3.709,0.0598,0.8284,3.5488,2.6294,1.2922,4.6206,2.4123,7.9083,5.7575,2.3101,3.9075,1.2811,4.4468,7.079,5.1236,1.0537,1.6578,2.0841,2.4044,3.2858,1.7425,3.4037,0.2298,1.4929,7.2747,0.7353,2.116,3.126,1.5499,2.9683,1.6604,6.3595,5.7134,0.8948,4.4694,4.2257,0.0513,3.4078,2.9756,0.2454,2.9962,5.5668,0.4419,1.9089,5.7191,1.8853,5.8377,5.7165,0.422,1.0664,7.1289,6.0803,1.2094,6.0765,8.3257,3.1097,1.6602,6.4062,2.0193,2.307,0.0157,4.4309,1.0817,4.0982,3.0859,2.5685,5.9187,0.147,4.1573,4.9279,5.2835,3.4148,1.3025,0.5883,3.6764,1.8082]}
{"id":1178,"ended":true,"length":270,"text":"Before the dam could be built, the Colorado River needed to be diverted away from the construction site. To accomplish this, four diversion tunnels were driven through the canyon walls, two in the center and two at either ends. They were drilled a total of about 2,100 feet (640 m) below the surface. Once these tunnels had been formed, the dam was built around them, using piles of rock to hold back the water. Because the dam was built with a rock face on the downstream side, water would spill over, generating hydropower downstream. At the time, this was considered by engineers to be one of the most dangerous construction projects in the world.\n\nThe construction of Hoover Dam had begun on July 1, 1931, and was completed and in place on January 11, 1935. This was six months ahead of schedule, at a cost of approximately $500 million. Most of the funds were financed by the Treasury's Bureau of Public Roads, and many states paid their half by selling bonds in the form of stock certificates that they would collect in return. The reservoir that was created by the dam was originally named Lake Mead, after former President Herbert Hoover. A series of pipes and dikes were built in the reservoir to allow water to be released as needed. Over the years, the reservoir became larger, allowing for more recreation opportunities as well as more water storage.","token_len":277,"entropy":[2.551,9.5016,7.2417,0.5524,1.4931,0.375,1.7124,7.3365,0.202,7.0073,0.7021,0.7113,3.7179,4.4039,0.281,0.7596,8.1716,0.8109,1.2554,5.2205,3.552,0.4768,0.13,6.7958,8.4019,3.8898,0.4036,10.7604,1.0837,0.4455,3.9659,3.973,1.6277,5.6409,2.8635,0.8844,2.6537,0.6874,1.5372,3.21,4.5257,4.9854,1.0099,4.1583,1.1599,5.3977,5.8979,2.6307,0.0428,4.9775,3.4295,0.4098,3.297,0.2034,2.2831,6.1888,2.0246,0.3101,2.9287,0.3247,1.7047,1.4594,5.1818,3.7458,0.9944,2.2964,0.1034,6.1906,0.2299,1.025,2.5614,1.7611,2.9018,5.9134,1.7898,1.5197,4.5173,7.9067,0.0601,3.3447,1.7188,3.4097,4.7654,0.8536,1.5013,0.9406,5.3998,1.2214,2.1695,0.87,1.8163,2.7449,1.8461,4.7011,3.2354,4.0471,0.996,6.822,0.1074,0.3837,4.1134,2.5046,5.3463,2.4974,4.8092,7.0183,8.1855,0.9393,0.0054,7.8256,0.7146,4.5946,0.8321,2.188,0.6475,2.6809,1.2264,1.3211,5.5475,5.2094,0.7002,0.0467,3.602,0.0366,0.0465,0.9949,3.3763,5.1348,0.538,0.6458,0.7649,1.5031,0.3261,0.9104,0.0065,1.6225,4.4731,0.3672,8.2068,0.009,4.2212,3.9994,2.7718,2.4656,2.0137,0.0679,4.5507,0.7484,1.3739,1.4809,1.2433,6.7873,5.7084,1.8448,2.8306,3.14,3.4258,0.0384,3.3046,0.3512,3.5766,1.4574,6.7519,0.6506,4.1926,0.0182,0.1131,1.1792,4.7648,2.3163,1.039,0.0677,3.6342,0.0465,3.7715,0.7389,0.4981,5.9546,0.4437,0.2655,5.4937,1.7115,7.3665,0.5449,1.261,6.4511,3.5991,3.7821,0.0116,4.7733,3.5663,0.9119,1.9552,4.588,6.1192,5.9523,4.0995,8.9606,7.9632,4.521,2.6462,3.5952,1.7791,2.9769,0.005,5.7649,1.5086,4.0323,3.2196,3.0598,6.1285,2.3903,3.9466,2.2359,1.6276,6.9823,4.2365,2.0891,4.0569,2.5782,0.6259,0.6203,0.8181,5.0296,4.4596,4.5991,2.6909,0.8327,2.2185,4.9022,2.1066,3.4661,0.0013,1.2382,4.4468,3.8633,0.0013,6.8325,2.6993,5.9644,2.899,1.854,1.5144,3.491,0.6019,2.0335,0.9606,3.5984,1.1658,0.3092,4.4471,3.7006,4.4738,3.2325,0.7266,5.2739,0.7481,1.6592,0.1453,0.9941,1.0378,2.6837,4.598,1.116,4.3577,1.6483,1.3441,7.8117,2.1963,4.8254,0.443,0.0459,2.5293,2.7504,3.2326,0.5464]}

His immediate concern was the expansion of the Quartermaster Corps itself. Although he had a reputation for being \"straight-forward and no-nonsense\", he made two attempts to reorganize the existing Corps structures.\n\nIn February 1941, he sought to establish more administrative and technical control over the Corps' Divisions, reporting to the Deputy Commander, Coast Defenses Forces, Atlantic, and the Commanding General of the Second Army, US Forces, UK and was later authorized to \"organize and reorganize the Quartermasters Department of the Army by consolidation of Divisions, Divisions, and Major Corps and Subdivisions\". His work to consolidate those Divisions he could not create resulted in the reduction of the existing Divisions to just nine by August 1941. However, in his final report, prepared shortly before his death on 2 January 1942, Somervell recommended the creation of 11 new division, all of which were created during the immediate post-war expansion.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, Somervell's successor, Major General John O. Wicker (1870\u20131945) expanded the Corps to its peacetime peak of over 80,000 active duty personnel in January 1944.","token_len":277,"entropy":[8.2777,8.1752,0.1927,10.5105,8.0613,0.9678,4.4443,4.9322,0.0387,0.4484,9.8534,4.0666,1.1061,0.3153,9.9645,0.1822,2.5247,1.3774,1.8872,2.1417,2.5575,0.1696,1.8153,9.374,2.4907,0.1464,4.5598,0.002,0.4082,3.4392,5.3654,1.9377,0.8027,0.2343,3.3966,5.1422,7.1744,0.1838,1.5914,6.797,0.0441,0.4597,5.4819,0.0112,0.1,7.1275,1.2131,4.598,1.5141,1.1439,3.7984,4.1652,0.5943,1.7661,4.1087,7.7193,1.4394,1.2479,2.3018,6.5041,0.7868,0.4969,0.0005,2.1735,0.7314,5.2451,5.5185,4.9159,0.4315,4.4101,0.5135,0.2979,6.1909,3.401,9.2569,1.2757,3.4537,0.0039,1.8093,2.6585,0.6174,0.2719,1.3171,5.9085,0.8018,3.0936,5.6819,5.538,2.3995,2.6983,1.9984,0.3397,0.2572,2.7685,2.8712,10.0175,0.0186,1.4026,8.2144,0.9261,1.5267,5.6419,2.4649,2.0735,10.4532,9.0316,1.8359,6.7177,0.7887,10.339,4.1998,2.3113,2.1445,3.1034,1.117,1.1204,1.0072,0.2735,5.7723,2.4937,1.3806,4.9177,4.1991,2.3517,7.5248,3.9165,7.8902,3.7303,5.6506,0.2273,5.5723,4.8794,0.0971,1.2837,4.1178,0.0144,0.9654,4.2094,4.4574,5.4346,1.6969,0.8301,1.5511,4.601,6.3797,0.9544,5.924,0.0044,2.3968,6.0094,0.0082,0.6804,0.6102,4.3739,2.9155,3.065,6.5212,1.4223,0.0032,2.2079,3.917,5.8157,4.8898,1.1294,5.6652,2.4879,0.0031,7.432,5.6767,3.5061,6.0044,4.0399,0.0118,0.9479,5.9863,0.2069,1.4719,5.3545,3.8822,0.0149,1.4194,4.7402,4.577,4.0005,3.5773,1.0002,0.4914,4.1844,0.0376,2.5275,3.6959,2.0552,1.2872,1.7779,4.9998,5.1144,0.9654,1.4929,1.6977,2.3315,3.8365,2.2788,0.5123,0.0923,1.15,0.0083,0.0007,5.2386,2.3086,1.559,0.018,7.0674,2.3229,3.9699,4.981,4.5449,0.7003,0.3496,1.465,4.87,4.1416,0.6488,6.5182,2.502,0.1579,0.2261,5.216,1.1824,1.1159,0.0002,4.0377,1.8124,0.2983,0.2463,1.8924,1.4655,0.1327,1.5581,0.0027,0.0008,1.6073,4.7989,0.4587,3.2781,0.6164,3.0995,4.3288,1.115,5.1278,4.9663,3.7266,2.1988,4.7842,1.1625,2.9541,1.5397,6.3157,0.2683,2.2248,1.7304,5.0578,13.4896,0.0024,4.6284,1.8124,4.0022,4.6349,0.7733,0.0108,3.5564,1.6263,2.3611,2.4803,3.5181,2.6966,0.5475]}

This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats in the United States House of Representatives, quickly became law. It set into motion an Agricultural Plan Act of 1987. It imposed on farmers a system that was controlled by a federal agency.\n\nThis federalization of agriculture, a system which controlled prices of crop inputs, gave Bedell and his colleagues the opportunity to control prices through their policies, and, in the process make significant profits. The plan also granted union bosses and their allies in Congress a significant amount of power.\n\nThe result of this act, which set into motion a trend that the United States had been slowly moving toward. In 1994 Congress passed the Agricultural Act to further expand federal controls over farming in the United States. Among other things this law created a national food stamp program.\n\nIt has also provided subsidies to farmers, which is something the U.S. government has always done. Under Reagan and George W. Bush the amount of federal subsidies increased dramatically.\n\nWhat the Agricultural Act did was to allow Congress and agricultural unions to use government to further their agenda.

One of the last surviving town halls on the British Isles, it serves as Oldham's civic centre.\n\nA large Victorian parish church on the border of Wigan and Stalybridge, the largest in Greater Manchester, built between 1852 and 1853. It was named St John the Evangelist's, and has a nave and chancel, and, in St John's Chapel, a chancel with a gallery on the south side and south transept. In 2009, it won the City Design Prize for the category of the best built local authority building. The parish also has a baptistry in the building. The church was consecrated on 24 January 1853 - the foundation stone having been laid by the Most Rev. William Thompson, Bishop of Manchester.\n\nFounded in 1833 as the Manchester Royal and Infirmary in memory of Prince Albert, its buildings were all erected between 1834 and 1843. It was given a new name in 1860. The main hospital has had several expansions since then, increasing and improving the accommodation. In 1968 it was the first NHS unit in the UK to provide fully funded day care. The hospital is still providing hospital as well as day care today.","token_len":279,"entropy":[9.6454,3.5134,6.8865,2.2342,3.4985,2.5312,2.0715,8.5912,2.0489,4.2102,8.8304,7.8685,13.6147,7.566,8.4242,10.5139,7.8538,0.0849,5.308,0.7238,1.9465,4.8292,2.7664,10.1688,1.5339,0.8554,7.1311,0.0122,6.3342,0.5274,8.4648,2.084,0.4097,5.809,0.5365,0.5338,5.5039,3.8103,5.248,0.3757,3.6441,0.6646,5.1487,0.5413,0.9856,1.0912,4.6168,0.3338,5.9993,0.0269,0.1026,6.1593,1.4678,1.2236,1.5483,0.0034,3.966,4.3191,4.7095,8.6211,0.827,4.1581,0.6297,8.3846,0.4534,6.6447,3.2836,0.5295,4.1655,8.6401,1.1084,1.8518,2.7558,4.9517,1.434,5.8586,0.9153,0.5537,5.8211,3.7778,0.8902,4.8102,0.0902,0.5929,2.9532,1.027,2.0568,1.2485,3.6584,4.6052,3.9535,2.224,2.6345,0.0039,3.1948,5.0266,2.2068,3.5035,1.8711,8.1739,2.9208,2.7977,13.2722,1.1835,3.6508,2.8327,5.361,2.0228,6.1563,1.9988,0.4672,2.9619,0.3648,2.2333,8.9726,0.0165,3.6081,1.1508,9.0073,3.6949,0.8035,3.7706,1.4126,3.6843,7.9858,8.4542,0.0812,0.0161,1.1072,3.9488,5.9542,0.5449,1.708,5.8172,0.4796,5.7025,5.8061,3.6831,0.9226,1.8291,7.6207,1.5085,2.7394,2.7951,7.7039,5.8896,5.4659,1.9687,0.8738,2.6911,3.4512,3.757,1.9017,0.6654,9.3338,2.0927,3.2184,1.4331,4.193,1.1225,2.8585,2.2632,1.6704,6.1965,0.0015,2.8294,4.7116,2.8954,2.1623,2.6426,5.8802,1.6105,7.1959,2.0538,6.7455,0.2274,2.6446,2.0519,1.7015,8.9297,1.7088,1.0879,2.9026,6.6775,1.6286,2.8522,0.0818,2.6762,0.7035,0.8771,0.0003,5.635,2.0746,0.4017,0.581,3.9426,2.104,1.509,4.7206,5.7759,5.6407,8.0494,0.6002,0.0098,3.7694,6.2249,0.0011,6.2349,3.7831,1.2711,4.7361,4.4779,2.3283,4.8941,5.4639,2.8214,0.488,3.8141,0.07,0.2397,3.5006,0.6752,1.8768,1.1902,5.9765,2.2684,3.4997,0.4385,0.8884,5.5332,2.5233,1.5472,4.5201,7.1389,4.0139,5.2264,4.5496,6.3943,2.1321,0.9291,0.8161,8.9065,6.5925,3.1835,2.3327,7.1119,2.0987,2.8301,5.5498,1.7565,0.8694,3.7419,1.6331,5.614,5.3725,1.4563,0.9986,1.0203,0.5548,3.9973,7.2442,4.3101,6.1542,0.6625,1.4689,2.067,1.8051,2.0612,2.8966,5.7608,5.2241,7.5367,0.8614,0.0176,2.2115,0.2408,6.5719,0.5046]}

{"id":2207,"ended":true,"length":251,"text":"During the 1920s and 1930s many skyscrapers were designed in an Art Deco style. This architectural approach typically combined what Carol Willis terms an `` aesthetic of simple, sculptural mass `` with the `` aesthetic of light ``, as expressed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The architects who produced such projects as the Chrysler Building, Empire State Building, and Waverly Inn are familiar to many readers of Popular Science Monthly. But there are scores of more obscure figures who, in the years between Wright's death in 1959 and the introduction of the International Style in the late 1950s, became very influential in this area, if only by virtue of their architectural acumen.\n\nSome of these talented architects were also brilliant innovators. One had even built a working model of the spacecraft that won humanity the first moon race. But they all shared a single trait : Each one was at home with the new technology that was transforming architecture in the post-WWII world.\n\nThat engineer-turned-architect John Galvin and his team of designers had built both a working model of the spacecraft that won humanity the first moon race and an aircraft that could travel at speeds approaching Mach 3 was, it turns out, no accident.\n\nThis content is available exclusively to SI All Access subscribers or Digital subscribers.\n\nIf you are already a subscriber, please login to access this exclusive content.","token_len":279,"entropy":[1.9437,7.0843,0.2327,1.8512,0.5657,0.0004,5.5009,9.9797,0.0439,0.0005,0.8486,3.8445,2.3756,4.3494,8.1146,0.176,0.0,0.4964,1.2719,3.2633,5.814,4.6576,8.3166,6.2527,7.1713,11.4258,7.0028,7.6347,3.7478,10.7624,11.3599,3.0034,6.9153,2.4712,6.5413,0.0605,7.8587,9.4581,0.4374,1.5248,4.3943,2.8901,0.0824,5.559,3.1121,2.6614,3.5158,6.377,0.9555,7.2005,1.0733,0.0012,1.6648,1.9774,5.9291,3.0391,4.7721,2.9169,5.133,5.5594,1.2121,6.1819,0.1797,1.1305,6.9373,0.4662,0.013,0.3151,0.7402,5.8946,4.2902,0.0744,8.1902,4.1236,5.9038,2.5168,1.7507,4.0996,1.0584,8.6626,3.0679,8.2419,0.7896,3.2972,3.6518,1.171,9.4156,0.229,4.6004,5.6239,6.2808,1.4381,4.1482,2.0415,1.8081,3.9927,3.2121,9.3476,0.1501,1.529,1.2886,4.5978,0.2789,1.0228,4.729,0.012,0.8001,5.9789,3.4673,2.2694,1.6249,2.4776,1.6945,0.0013,0.1375,3.9884,5.0742,2.5361,0.8657,4.0135,2.0252,2.9392,6.5914,2.4773,3.5726,2.2205,0.0017,0.3116,5.6422,5.2632,0.019,0.334,1.9944,0.0995,4.8275,0.5524,0.9568,9.0175,0.6874,1.8035,3.1035,6.659,5.4139,0.001,1.3778,3.6483,8.5439,6.1876,3.6521,0.7928,7.4781,2.3942,0.6011,1.3612,8.7581,1.917,7.23,11.3585,1.6723,1.3367,5.2715,5.6353,0.751,3.6566,3.6626,3.889,4.6432,1.3224,5.0161,4.2931,9.5202,8.5032,3.078,1.8078,5.7345,4.5183,2.3158,1.3781,6.1339,1.7353,2.7674,1.522,4.7268,5.4374,2.5155,0.5707,4.3753,0.164,2.0192,0.0979,1.2615,0.2318,1.4491,0.0002,5.3231,9.612,4.4338,2.3103,0.0129,3.8177,0.0017,5.1546,8.065,2.4273,4.3837,0.3928,2.1968,2.3334,3.0094,3.3984,3.7023,5.8711,2.9919,5.6738,0.5681,0.385,0.455,1.2995,2.6002,1.5037,2.4311,0.1904,0.0531,0.0787,0.0313,0.244,2.4669,4.4979,1.0185,2.9,3.7747,2.184,1.5913,4.3863,1.5756,1.4379,2.0622,4.2693,4.3019,3.1283,0.0078,0.0024,3.9187,1.4522,0.1695,1.8731,0.0002,4.312,10.8569,0.613,3.4824,5.8224,0.1078,7.3939,9.9287,0.017,2.1478,6.2264,12.3955,4.4591,1.4287,3.2141,0.0002,4.3936,0.2081,2.343,3.2956,0.5254,0.2311,0.6649,0.9826,3.388,2.7128,1.1813,1.2502,10.9533,0.093,0.2564]}

{"id":648,"ended":true,"length":250,"text":"Several of Kilmer's poems, including `` Trees ``, were set to music and published in England by Kilmer's mother, Annie Kilburn Kilmer, who was a writer and amateur composer. The poems on this CD were originally published in her first volume, A Southern Book of Verses : Poems, 1915-1918, (1946), including, of course, `` Trees \" (1915), which was an early example of what was beginning to be called the `` American Songbook \" and one of the best-known poems in America.\n\nThe poems on this CD were originally published in Southern Book of Verses, vol. V, 1915 - 1918, (1958), by the Georgia State Department of Libraries. The music has been composed and arranged by Robert J. Wilmers to poems by Kilmer ; arrangements were adapted from previously published pieces by Wilmers. Most of the poems were also transcribed in prose so that the reader could enjoy the sonnets more by heart.\n\nWilmers has produced a CD which may very well become available in other CD retailers as his name gradually becomes known. The sonnets flow freely and are full of lovely imagery which have, unfortunately, become increasingly rare in print and on line. Robert Wilmers has recorded several volumes of poetry by T. S. Eliot and William Wordsworth as well as more contemporary poets.","token_len":279,"entropy":[3.3551,11.7668,3.4501,0.1008,6.8021,2.24,2.1396,9.8348,16.1455,7.6227,1.7734,2.0426,6.9665,1.4443,2.0194,2.6972,5.5833,0.7819,5.4505,2.7782,5.7121,0.0121,1.2873,4.6702,0.8265,5.2738,2.4948,10.8416,4.7828,1.7644,1.2334,1.6775,1.8264,1.9157,4.2574,1.1813,7.2878,5.2584,0.6163,1.9945,1.9475,6.2694,2.4348,5.9297,1.6228,3.6329,1.7682,0.6679,5.4313,5.3344,2.113,1.0979,4.1522,7.8415,6.1539,0.608,10.4492,0.3692,8.8266,5.0976,0.2561,2.2497,9.2254,0.4186,0.3486,2.1319,1.2023,4.6737,3.1928,5.0861,0.9077,7.0379,5.0072,4.1421,0.1581,0.002,2.6943,3.3971,3.4799,1.607,0.8968,2.7605,0.7474,2.619,1.1804,4.0792,2.6931,4.0422,0.1792,4.2183,2.0695,9.3139,0.043,0.8826,2.7612,2.1881,3.4722,4.6578,2.5785,1.3805,2.0419,2.8901,5.3034,0.1088,0.4113,3.1433,1.7533,0.3026,2.8477,1.3745,4.1342,0.7007,2.4822,0.0861,1.8463,5.0651,2.0658,0.2722,0.0339,1.3431,1.8864,0.1689,0.1283,9.066,2.9613,0.6642,0.2701,0.0005,1.817,6.5162,0.1243,5.1557,0.7411,3.5242,4.055,3.5887,0.8844,3.8447,0.3853,6.4353,0.6081,3.4098,2.5215,7.6587,3.3849,5.1533,0.217,3.7874,0.9022,1.2384,5.7871,6.0525,0.4112,4.2652,2.412,3.316,0.1762,5.1392,4.2314,0.0674,5.5516,6.3237,7.2419,10.4872,1.5845,3.3046,0.0121,10.2446,7.7024,1.877,8.3815,1.1332,6.9332,0.1914,4.854,0.9852,2.1103,0.0721,1.8896,5.8416,0.2748,0.2101,2.0387,1.7596,4.199,6.213,0.0013,3.085,6.6321,5.7292,0.568,1.5386,2.7361,0.8984,3.9352,0.759,11.0564,2.4933,5.3277,5.8827,3.71,0.6377,1.4134,0.0003,7.9613,0.0974,3.3711,4.142,1.7096,5.4234,4.4745,5.5184,6.8378,0.0346,3.6902,4.7942,1.8512,4.8347,5.6476,6.502,2.7015,7.5536,7.1603,8.2221,2.1804,2.8684,0.6931,1.8347,8.0718,0.579,10.5547,3.3653,2.8171,1.4135,5.4038,0.0637,6.4259,4.3853,3.9665,4.198,5.7911,4.1748,0.13,2.2431,3.4372,3.0503,1.3117,5.2216,2.8081,3.0122,9.1107,0.6536,7.5702,1.0168,0.0402,1.9138,5.7525,2.9553,4.8071,0.3892,3.8551,3.6161,7.3005,0.4848,3.3682,0.0698,2.306,1.8669,5.0517,3.844,0.024,4.4965,0.2455,0.0345,5.2077,3.7177,5.5292,2.036]}

One can understand the scale of cruise passenger traffic. For example, a cruise ship can carry 1,000 passengers and 2,000 crew members and support staff. The passenger terminal of Blue Marina Gateway opened in 2010. The terminal has two floors and one parking area which has a capacity of 1,500 cars. The terminal has three lanes.\n\nThe terminal is considered as one of the largest passenger terminals in the world. The parking lots provide enough space for all cruise ships to park during the period that they sail in the bay of Ashdod.\n\nIt is important to mention that the cruise fleet that currently uses the Blue Marina Gateway has experienced a significant growth. It is worth mentioning that the fleet has grown from 21 cruise ships in 2011 to 35 vessels in 2015 and to 41 ships in 2015. It is the second largest fleet in the world and the third largest in Europe. The fleet is expected to grow even further in the coming years.","token_len":279,"entropy":[2.8744,1.6055,10.8538,12.1352,1.9547,1.0601,5.8672,0.7184,7.8017,5.324,0.007,2.352,1.9735,6.3121,5.1924,1.776,9.6539,0.8546,6.3362,5.3843,1.5226,3.3909,4.3142,0.0064,8.9782,2.7698,6.5998,0.7763,2.0333,6.4107,7.1505,7.4529,0.9,9.1692,8.6725,1.3409,3.4401,5.1083,0.1233,2.2538,2.6113,3.3841,1.419,0.076,1.8115,4.9626,1.5889,1.1468,4.3037,2.9287,3.0472,1.4976,1.1973,5.6975,2.559,1.0096,3.4536,0.5866,5.3257,1.6514,0.2316,1.6526,3.2155,0.1571,6.1199,0.8981,3.6393,5.7404,4.2032,1.9796,2.7858,0.5438,1.2446,1.6449,0.0203,3.9088,3.0494,0.387,2.3762,5.3389,0.0305,3.0193,4.4694,0.6191,0.6301,0.5574,1.5854,4.4657,1.7057,6.7899,1.4022,7.9196,0.157,4.7102,7.1889,2.0914,1.7893,4.4495,1.07,0.1799,2.1674,0.814,0.1493,1.175,0.7737,2.189,0.1122,0.5863,0.2977,3.4349,4.7239,0.259,0.2879,4.4044,0.7505,4.1943,6.0311,4.4399,0.6067,1.9682,4.9216,4.9208,2.9395,2.1017,0.0802,5.0106,7.2547,0.8166,3.6255,0.6147,1.5059,3.1282,2.0268,4.2535,3.3724,1.4412,3.4632,5.4493,1.5632,4.3806,3.0818,1.9876,1.3113,0.2135,1.9793,0.0948,1.9681,4.318,0.6385,1.2452,2.0548,1.6141,4.0196,4.2497,2.5201,2.4597,0.0002,1.5989,2.8168,1.1957,6.0449,2.88,1.9854,0.0164,0.0742,3.0951,3.6647,0.7521,0.1781,0.4199,0.1633,0.367,1.4988,6.2587,5.5548,5.0821,5.9614,0.7554,0.5095,3.3751,3.5012,0.5761,1.5458,2.6072,6.246,1.1336,6.7722,4.473,1.125,4.7787,2.9162,0.9284,4.8855,3.5388,1.9848,0.0367,0.0006,0.1797,1.5619,0.0002,4.2383,0.2955,2.3028,0.1179,3.9853,0.1847,1.1195,3.3358,4.6747,4.2931,5.804,4.5315,0.6212,1.1829,0.0771,0.0854,2.4757,5.0557,1.5115,2.3784,3.6416,1.3581,2.9271,0.8986,4.1768,0.9791,0.0905,1.1846,3.2604,1.6724,2.9981,1.8122,6.13,4.3194,0.1727,0.8555,2.6609,0.2521,4.5152,3.772,0.406,1.9488,3.4387,3.2269,5.1748,1.5375,0.1843,3.4093,0.1823,2.7731,0.4663,4.5855,3.0865,0.4305,0.7872,0.9596,0.263,0.1088,1.9049,1.5951,1.9572,0.1175,1.1807,2.9683,0.2254,1.821,1.5331,1.4564,2.9857,0.0042,1.1691,3.2827,0.9115,1.4751,0.9766,1.1207,0.2002,0.3329]}
{"id":57,"ended":true,"length":168,"text":"In addition to the reactions originally reported by Johnson, Corey, and Chaykovsky, sulfur ylides have been used for a number of related homologation reactions that tend to be grouped under the same general headings, such as 1,2-disubstituted sulfides, hydroxylsulfides, and sulfites. Of particular interest in these related chemistry are processes for the preparation of 1,4-disubstituted sulfides. For example, we have observed the formation of a 1,4-disubstituted sulfide when a 1,2-dichloroethane-based reagent is reacted with a methylsulfide. However, similar to Johnson and Corey, we were unable to observe the formation of 1,4-disubstituted sulfides upon reaction of ethylsulfide or acetylsulfide with the 1,2-dichloroethane-based reagent. The 1,2-dichloroethane-based reagent that was observed, in addition to being relatively expensive, is difficult to obtain in commercial quantities.\nAccordingly, there is a need for alternative methods for the preparation and homologation of 1,4-disubstituted sulfides.\nAll references cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","token_len":279,"entropy":[7.6823,0.9728,1.6129,10.8305,9.0249,1.4383,1.1419,7.3303,0.9447,10.2484,3.5514,1.0339,6.3369,4.197,4.8642,1.2959,0.2527,13.6481,11.6706,2.8367,9.5629,1.6648,0.8191,4.2077,3.0531,3.425,0.9848,0.0098,7.0363,10.2494,1.184,9.3273,2.169,3.4663,7.3099,0.0249,1.78,7.6548,2.3802,0.8268,3.4355,4.6485,7.213,0.6137,2.3729,1.6985,0.0013,6.1047,1.3303,1.5031,0.7992,6.7668,3.571,0.2426,0.0979,0.354,2.8595,1.8548,0.916,6.0873,0.3916,0.8578,4.2287,0.0703,0.5582,0.0604,0.7084,2.0386,2.9536,0.3241,6.271,1.9615,0.3708,2.9222,3.1823,6.6124,6.6118,2.7435,8.7487,4.7927,2.9146,4.8578,0.1328,5.8218,0.254,2.828,0.1028,2.0388,0.0482,0.0081,0.003,0.0102,0.7201,0.4169,2.7346,3.9845,1.0758,0.0127,5.1493,0.9041,3.0171,2.1057,0.8072,0.0566,2.841,3.4685,0.1839,0.3001,0.088,1.1474,0.0062,0.0063,0.0013,0.0059,0.5512,0.3423,4.2324,2.3915,2.9601,0.1329,2.627,0.0808,3.3587,2.9042,0.0252,1.0566,2.8997,0.1009,2.3029,3.6335,7.4073,0.1184,0.8875,6.6507,0.2639,1.6497,3.8925,5.8858,0.013,0.5855,1.7437,4.0667,0.0064,6.0532,4.0824,6.4748,1.1329,3.9778,0.2665,2.6046,5.0917,0.8243,0.0042,2.296,0.7713,0.4647,0.0493,2.0994,0.0138,0.3186,0.0226,0.684,0.0043,0.0018,0.0012,0.0044,0.1535,0.4135,6.8387,3.0304,2.2019,6.3073,0.5436,1.9888,0.0083,0.5882,4.0238,6.7931,2.4712,0.8918,0.0065,0.1323,1.3371,3.0872,2.1554,0.0122,1.2231,0.0328,0.2999,0.0016,0.0013,0.0472,0.036,0.0071,1.1231,0.1464,0.1742,0.0084,0.3761,2.4488,4.0531,0.0075,1.3689,0.015,0.1621,0.0014,0.0012,0.0182,0.0094,0.0046,0.38,0.065,0.0696,0.0054,5.5328,1.3406,5.9528,4.0565,3.2312,1.8198,0.204,2.5277,5.0566,5.1617,0.5498,2.0498,5.945,0.0548,2.0176,2.2533,3.2934,2.1932,0.7834,2.2228,14.1578,1.2124,0.0027,4.1174,0.9536,1.4702,1.7896,0.5042,6.7065,3.009,1.011,1.241,1.5058,2.9515,7.191,1.1608,0.3187,0.0429,1.2442,0.0047,0.1915,0.014,0.5614,0.0018,0.0026,0.0008,0.0045,0.1231,0.044,0.7804,4.2153,6.6126,7.9405,2.7552,1.5822,0.9317,5.7667,0.6136,0.1438,0.035,2.3057,0.331,0.0471,0.6661]}

Vision tests or ocular-refraction, performed by an Ophthalmologist, is a type of eye examination that lets me determine exactly which of your eye conditions is causing your vision problems and where in your eye they appear.","token_len":279,"entropy":[10.1641,0.3102,4.1033,3.0102,6.2693,1.7754,0.0011,2.3,9.6336,8.0213,8.9273,4.2816,2.7135,4.932,3.1246,1.7178,1.0833,3.6684,3.7732,7.2383,2.0657,3.7336,1.4745,2.1584,5.7757,5.4619,0.7554,2.0788,7.5674,14.3045,6.4229,6.0363,11.1197,12.4812,8.7812,2.0187,0.1518,1.4249,5.5424,5.243,4.1503,4.2898,4.6031,4.0454,0.6743,4.9859,3.3337,0.1625,5.1129,5.358,6.5025,8.4194,4.0906,3.3965,2.545,0.5771,3.7238,0.5402,4.7981,1.819,1.9041,8.9478,0.2237,8.2462,2.4606,6.3157,2.6977,4.0607,1.1281,4.9334,5.7529,3.4169,5.2289,1.7327,0.0038,4.0683,6.3242,7.5678,2.1853,3.5986,1.2336,1.8004,3.9694,5.2345,7.09,0.1084,2.6536,0.6897,4.8442,1.325,0.2035,1.1033,2.7464,7.2401,1.7885,0.6082,2.001,3.6304,6.4123,0.6822,2.4547,0.0036,5.8928,0.5319,0.0636,1.2487,3.9113,0.2493,3.0303,2.5365,5.7723,2.4812,1.7534,6.5368,0.5718,0.0006,0.2191,1.7429,0.0002,2.1016,1.6306,0.5727,0.2318,0.4706,0.7992,1.5885,1.2001,0.1349,0.106,0.0005,0.0061,0.0034,0.0051,0.0018,0.0007,0.0043,0.0237,0.0016,0.0017,0.0186,0.0394,0.0047,0.0371,0.0018,0.0038,0.0017,0.0027,0.0016,0.0015,0.0017,0.0006,0.0005,0.0041,0.0008,0.0019,0.0087,0.0033,0.0046,0.0033,0.0021,0.002,1.9655,0.0001,1.5459,1.1668,1.8288,1.3221,2.1544,5.1367,0.037,0.0724,1.9571,3.3496,1.2469,2.7542,2.7134,3.9028,0.0947,1.2845,5.0397,0.6008,0.0024,2.6322,1.3962,6.0668,2.0779,3.338,0.3257,0.1646,0.05,4.0872,6.9948,7.8783,2.0659,1.7466,3.8816,2.1155,0.0024,4.1159,0.9212,3.2313,3.6795,0.0088,0.7572,1.6191,4.6154,3.6453,0.4497,4.2776,4.8329,0.2958,0.9358,0.0002,4.4037,1.2602,2.6072,0.6229,1.698,0.057,0.1479,0.3145,9.7885,6.0665,2.3217,0.9872,1.5327,0.1024,2.2103,2.0679,0.0019,1.856,2.1649,3.7825,8.0033,4.4113,2.9508,0.2347,1.7158,0.6749,0.2325,5.5457,7.1835,1.0592,2.6777,4.7255,0.2965,0.0657,0.0917,0.3692,5.4114,1.5632,3.5951,0.0142,1.8509,2.2521,0.8791,6.2506,7.423,3.3086,5.3785,2.5777,2.5562,4.0563,2.3641,3.3539,1.5916,1.0666,1.5863,1.2233,0.2263,3.0,4.0389,3.6999,1.3996,3.891,2.1116,4.9412,0.1907]}

During his lifetime, and even up to the time of his death, he refused all attempts to present him as a virtuoso. Alkan was by contrast never shy about showing that he had the talents necessary and perhaps even more to be famous ; as to Berlioz's views on his talent and its public presentation, we can say that Alkan was indeed much more \"accessible\" to his audiences than was his master.\n\nI had not realized this, but both men were born in the same year -- May 28, 1743 -- and died in the same month -- July 26, 1821 or 1822.\n\nBut back to my original question.

Nuzman's son's company also provided consultancy to the bid committee on the technical and financial aspects of the bid, and a large proportion of the US $ 5 million appears to have gone there.\n\n\"What the Bid committee is doing is, using public money to try to promote themselves and to try to convince FIFA and CONMEBOL that it would be financially better for them to vote for them, regardless of whether or not we really need more stadiums. \"","token_len":280,"entropy":[11.2305,2.7763,0.0063,6.4879,4.1986,3.762,6.3036,9.7968,6.1241,16.04,9.55,5.0031,11.9721,3.8104,4.2682,1.0578,4.8549,0.0803,5.2892,9.3339,0.0941,5.0837,4.4621,3.8194,3.0106,1.2301,2.9199,5.5053,4.5678,0.0454,5.6267,10.9804,5.457,6.3692,5.6419,1.2142,4.8815,4.7746,2.0099,6.5956,0.0311,0.0514,0.8556,10.9468,5.7472,0.0417,1.4326,1.502,0.0724,0.0163,0.0033,6.1441,2.0817,1.0469,5.5176,2.4693,1.2355,1.6345,2.4478,0.0178,3.6603,3.0551,4.354,3.8896,3.6851,6.0246,4.8563,4.2665,6.0705,0.083,5.0236,5.3524,6.9229,5.5992,3.7421,0.9889,7.8879,3.3044,0.0541,0.0035,1.2731,1.0899,6.0088,0.1246,2.7095,1.8411,0.4017,0.068,0.0064,1.4047,1.1391,1.6157,0.1272,4.3482,7.3498,1.3872,3.0369,3.9322,0.1353,3.9908,2.4818,4.7879,0.1501,3.4503,1.7542,7.5336,2.5074,1.5963,6.4047,4.4732,0.5444,0.2304,1.457,0.5777,4.3131,0.9309,4.126,3.918,5.3056,0.7818,1.2121,6.5465,0.2033,7.3258,1.4011,4.0896,5.596,2.7742,1.7916,0.2636,1.6921,0.8192,3.2757,0.704,4.5744,0.2754,5.102,0.0172,0.0011,0.0001,1.5233,1.3747,0.053,3.0688,0.1069,1.1535,0.663,0.6239,3.9038,0.1491,3.8718,2.1187,5.524,4.2185,0.4258,1.1489,2.4695,2.714,0.3753,6.4654,3.4528,0.1623,6.801,6.337,0.0095,2.9123,0.0471,0.0073,1.2212,2.4659,0.0022,5.0543,1.7043,2.6091,2.588,2.2828,0.8867,4.0456,0.8712,4.5284,0.0426,4.7052,0.75,1.0587,4.1761,0.0422,0.0063,1.3117,0.9602,3.0952,2.639,4.0075,4.5156,4.9855,2.2715,1.3285,3.5388,0.0544,3.5783,1.6767,6.4681,2.5603,1.0953,0.9363,0.1156,0.6268,1.47,1.7445,1.4453,4.3406,3.784,3.5961,0.2185,0.8922,3.0475,0.4795,1.771,0.0656,7.6392,0.0564,0.3106,1.7683,9.0597,1.1399,2.0672,0.0844,5.3704,5.1243,3.1165,7.0353,3.9293,2.7483,1.1919,0.6281,4.5062,6.0422,4.3277,1.3554,1.5656,4.1741,0.3736,5.3016,5.3651,1.632,1.8112,2.6281,0.0652,4.3853,2.9978,3.2083,3.2746,0.0044,0.0016,0.0001,1.0622,2.4683,3.9769,0.4537,4.7099,3.7159,1.1457,0.6405,0.2447,5.4422,0.9844,3.7657,1.792,7.9318,0.0702,2.0037,1.5159,0.0041,4.3427,4.7663,4.7817,5.2274,7.8892,1.8003,4.7824]}

Unimpressed with it, she called the Miami River about three times, and received a return call from an old gentleman who sounded just like \"Punchy\" O'Brien, the Miami River guide that she had first met while attending the State University of Missouri in Columbia. He confirmed that she had indeed written him; he gave her all the details on the Miami River, and she wrote the story from his perspective.\n\nAfter a year of research and writing, Douglass completed her first book, Miami River, which became her only bestseller. It was quickly translated into more than 25 foreign languages, became a huge success in her own country, and made her famous to all those who lived near its banks. The story was a sensation at a time when the river was considered a \"drainage ditch\" that was used to send raw sewage into the sea.\n\nThe book was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1943, and Douglass later said that it was \"the first great American children's book.\"\n\nThis book has had huge significance for generations of young and old readers in the United States and abroad, and its appeal has only grown over the years.

{"id":3306,"ended":true,"length":258,"text":"The presence of battleships had a great psychological and diplomatic impact. Similar to possessing nuclear weapons today, the ownership of battleships served to enhance a nation's force projection. Even during the 1940's, when the US had a battleship fleet, much of its overseas territory, including the Philippines, was not connected by a reliable submarine network. It was much easier to dominate the South Pacific, where the US did not have to worry about submarine attacks, if the US had a battleship to fire a sub-launched, nuclear, cruise missile, rather than a less capable and destructive, but far faster, sub-surface missile. That was one of the reasons why the US built ballistic missile submarines ; by the mid-1950's, there were enough strategic and intermediate-range ballistic missiles on hand to dominate the Western Pacific for some decades.\n\nThe second reason why battleships were relevant was the development during the second world war of a more powerful version of submarine cruise missiles. They were fast enough to strike most areas of both land and sea and were extremely effective. That made the battleship obsolete and resulted in a number of battleships being turned into aircraft or aircraft carriers. The use of battleships to fire cruise missiles would have been much the same as the use of surface-to-air missiles today.

If one is not an engineer, there's another.\n\nBut there are also certain qualities and qualities of character as well as knowledge to help people identify what their best path has become and to help them find their best possible path.\n\nHere's the funny thing though: We use those same labels for those who do choose that profession and are successful, while those who do not, we put them in a corner and mock them and we call them failures.\n\nYou can call them failure and failure only if they chose that and failed at it.\n\nSo if the education system in China is not giving the students the tools that they need, what alternative is there for them to make better choices?","token_len":281,"entropy":[5.5124,11.7476,0.0808,0.8905,10.1297,4.3818,1.4117,2.8414,0.3876,4.3635,0.8502,5.6005,2.6539,7.6454,8.3432,5.462,6.1923,2.4828,7.5695,3.1422,4.4165,4.8814,4.9223,2.7859,0.0412,1.6595,8.6605,0.7363,8.4928,16.2279,8.3126,8.2138,10.7502,3.0786,8.7593,0.8993,0.0158,7.9019,3.981,1.4841,6.4403,6.0399,5.8144,0.1366,1.6351,0.6158,0.8906,0.0957,3.7214,6.5504,4.3034,0.3089,3.2552,1.9426,3.9158,5.7743,7.2723,5.7195,1.5165,2.5148,1.2366,1.9319,4.2343,1.4225,0.1954,2.9137,2.6624,8.8956,6.076,0.3814,4.1896,4.9147,0.7231,3.9962,1.5364,3.9549,0.2362,1.0133,4.7471,4.5351,6.5241,5.0944,4.2379,3.8785,0.0619,0.0725,4.9165,3.9305,3.4718,0.1983,0.4264,1.9999,4.3616,0.2465,3.7891,3.5269,3.4362,5.8147,1.622,4.3733,1.8282,0.6479,0.0401,0.2102,0.9638,1.208,0.8382,2.9096,1.2173,4.6301,5.4264,3.4996,4.9475,3.0487,1.5204,0.0003,3.8477,1.1303,3.4091,3.2254,1.8673,4.336,1.8555,2.5723,2.5409,1.0302,0.004,2.1832,1.769,4.5715,2.5106,0.7915,2.7564,2.0417,4.0225,2.1873,0.986,1.9322,3.3731,3.7224,1.5309,5.8834,3.8303,0.3208,1.2718,0.4528,0.0896,2.0562,2.2549,0.0002,3.6715,2.7947,0.8357,2.3042,4.9077,6.3426,3.2795,2.8004,2.4421,7.9184,5.3124,0.2445,2.0743,5.9381,4.6495,3.5345,3.312,6.7224,4.0321,3.9187,4.733,2.0821,6.443,3.2797,2.9698,2.4424,1.9191,0.7333,3.5053,1.8791,3.2935,5.2708,0.8746,0.416,0.5521,0.0003,5.9929,1.0664,2.007,7.8229,0.6562,3.5199,1.0439,3.6119,5.0302,4.1705,3.7008,8.3115,2.3647,2.6739,1.0474,3.9229,6.5015,4.4121,3.324,2.5249,3.3976,3.6681,2.4219,4.7093,1.5695,0.3717,1.8234,0.2424,1.99,3.0586,5.5965,1.3453,1.3318,1.9336,6.675,1.6558,7.8502,0.5833,2.6506,5.3546,3.0507,0.0594,6.3103,0.387,0.4629,0.0002,4.4682,1.5096,4.5089,1.0317,4.4796,2.6001,3.2638,5.8839,1.2242,1.2866,4.3427,1.928,7.3866,4.7779,3.7656,1.1493,0.6158,0.8175,0.0002,3.5278,3.0666,3.7634,5.1748,1.3631,3.3636,1.4126,0.6798,2.5748,5.381,3.8995,2.9119,1.0042,4.1948,2.9677,0.5282,0.1842,1.4845,3.2127,7.967,2.1713,0.0543,1.8586,0.3485,1.2914,3.882,5.8668,0.7038,0.6121]}

{"id":2752,"ended":true,"length":270,"text":"Lowell's sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted the search for Planet X. Failing to find the planet, according to one friend, `` virtually killed him ``. Lowell's widow, however, believed the search had concluded, believing that her husband had discovered a previously unknown planet. Lowell's friend, Henry Norris Russell, wrote that Lowell had '' been absolutely, completely convinced '' that he had found an unknown planet, which had an annual periodicity of 365 days. The planet, he said, was too cold to support life, though it had a water content similar to Earth and a sun like our own.\n\nIt was only in 1989 that astronomers discovered that two stars were orbiting a so-called solar double star, but the orbits of the two stars were not aligned. The two stars, they found, are moving in opposite directions, making it very unlikely that a third body could orbit between them. The third body, astronomers concluded, must orbit far beyond the orbit of Neptune.\n\nIt is not known whether or not Lowell's planet would have been more closely spaced from the sun than the known planets. It might well have been a gas giant, or possibly even a brown dwarf, a hypothetical failed star that is too small for nuclear fusion to occur. Such a star, if it existed, certainly would not be close enough to the sun to be detected as a planetary perturbation.","token_len":281,"entropy":[9.0719,2.4695,8.829,2.4141,2.8976,9.3768,9.5266,3.554,0.8908,7.2373,0.3118,12.8024,1.4492,0.9967,6.6986,4.146,0.3467,1.2231,1.4087,2.484,0.9946,8.2256,0.0009,4.6481,7.1635,0.1934,10.6451,13.7898,5.3297,1.743,9.0516,2.5601,8.8894,1.4694,4.5704,1.0537,5.3046,0.0047,4.4947,2.3882,4.4374,2.6061,5.8001,2.6923,5.7757,0.8915,2.819,0.4382,1.0654,4.344,2.3118,5.887,0.6161,1.4095,0.9509,4.0447,1.2305,4.309,1.25,5.1421,6.9586,8.4017,0.3464,3.1093,2.0826,1.8481,1.6745,4.1387,4.0904,7.722,5.0132,2.0334,2.6166,7.4359,0.2251,2.268,0.586,0.9326,3.485,2.3368,0.7817,2.0089,3.5931,3.1468,4.9562,8.3222,6.4361,5.9472,0.275,5.871,0.5038,0.8714,2.5782,4.2329,1.9166,1.9215,1.7809,0.0361,1.099,5.3617,3.1585,0.773,2.1692,0.4795,1.3834,4.4317,1.5011,1.6905,1.7102,5.9609,5.3773,4.5368,0.0051,2.3098,3.7044,2.3009,5.8792,5.3397,6.6525,0.5639,0.4162,3.9992,0.0038,4.2177,0.8843,2.5287,1.4673,6.9804,0.4277,4.718,2.4738,2.4311,5.8765,3.9361,2.4212,1.7705,2.08,7.2564,0.0437,0.0045,5.4092,8.2269,1.4166,1.2133,4.1216,2.3388,5.2977,0.5889,1.1763,1.1634,0.537,0.8761,1.7528,4.6946,1.1716,1.7764,2.4876,0.5061,2.0189,3.8147,2.8804,0.1285,3.5698,6.006,1.7033,1.3879,0.0696,1.3478,4.1676,1.5009,4.6204,2.2133,0.2353,3.4654,5.7639,5.7,2.5435,5.5727,5.8386,0.4029,0.2332,2.0819,4.3112,0.2675,1.2284,3.6667,2.9466,0.0351,2.9589,5.97,4.0063,2.9785,0.9639,3.4777,0.161,3.8357,0.9647,0.9736,0.0003,4.0006,1.4144,1.8158,1.3546,1.6329,3.9954,0.0164,0.276,1.3256,4.6871,2.9005,0.5611,1.1413,4.3288,4.8073,5.8759,3.5407,1.0752,1.2641,0.7247,1.9044,6.5388,1.7389,1.3308,3.1231,4.1425,4.1068,0.2253,0.4298,2.5002,5.3107,0.1291,1.5764,2.0733,3.5789,3.0134,0.4446,6.3703,0.0292,1.0896,3.8419,5.7685,10.5959,1.8041,1.7283,2.8107,4.2993,2.3745,1.8213,7.8915,0.4754,1.6324,4.6672,0.4986,5.3232,0.742,1.3168,2.1157,4.3304,0.5874,1.304,0.215,7.1771,0.5946,2.1308,1.4918,4.2437,0.518,0.1292,1.3132,0.2602,0.2925,2.2086,4.1094,3.0599,0.7452,3.8324,8.7527,0.0524,0.0741,0.4057]}

{"id":185,"ended":true,"length":267,"text":"After the United Kingdom's entry into World War I in 1914, Wheeler volunteered for the armed forces. Although preferring solitary to group activities, Wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed soldiering. He excelled on the rifle range, quickly learning to operate a Maxim machine gun. He was commissioned Second Lieutenant ( Acting Captain ) while a student at Oxford. His time out of the forces was spent lecturing at the King's School, Wimbledon. On the opening night of the First World War, Wheeler enlisted for active service and was commissioned Second Lieutenant ( Acting Captain ) of the Rifle Section, Second Queen's Dragoon Guards. In France, Wheeler served with distinction, and was promoted to lieutenant after his secondment to the Machine Gun School at the School of Infantry at Aldershot. In October 1915, he was wounded twice, firstly in the mouth by shrapnel and then at Ypres. He was badly wounded a third time, however, when a shell exploded near his dugout on the 2 January 1916.\n\nWheeler's military career ended with a court martial, which found him guilty of gross professional misconduct, disobedience, absence with leave and bad conduct. However, he survived his wounds and, back in England, was placed on the retired list. He was promoted to captain on the retired list in 1918, and the next year was created a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.","token_len":282,"entropy":[2.3183,6.9138,4.2643,1.4444,6.1167,0.2077,3.4067,0.0949,1.6475,3.3316,2.074,0.142,12.6395,8.8708,1.5462,0.8095,5.8517,0.2358,1.7833,5.1957,10.9827,8.3917,5.8343,3.4981,2.5576,0.3001,1.9877,4.3173,2.4812,1.7019,7.8374,0.7009,8.5267,0.03,2.1931,1.2941,6.2725,0.0001,4.4276,1.3326,5.2731,4.6954,0.9893,7.4796,4.361,1.2941,4.5666,1.4275,9.9599,1.1923,0.1417,2.0749,1.3724,1.9307,5.3684,8.4908,0.1048,3.6394,15.7088,3.6089,0.3888,7.021,4.2995,3.563,0.5209,3.6358,2.0045,3.4834,5.2765,6.7536,1.3065,0.8728,8.115,1.243,2.5189,8.394,0.0036,1.559,1.2391,6.6296,0.1245,4.2378,1.8175,9.7671,0.1282,1.4697,3.973,2.007,7.0758,3.2132,0.1523,0.6582,3.2826,0.4494,0.001,0.3976,0.7189,5.2289,3.0705,6.4272,1.8894,2.7075,1.4473,3.2453,3.0937,0.0173,1.3744,1.3848,0.7361,0.7343,2.9282,0.2355,6.6238,5.2593,2.2349,2.3969,11.1211,0.402,8.4634,0.1007,5.0615,0.9516,2.317,6.4517,0.575,0.9344,2.2221,2.7706,4.8415,2.5942,3.126,1.6049,2.6542,0.1437,4.534,5.4578,2.4419,3.9267,9.202,2.1355,0.5789,9.5803,0.3814,7.0887,2.1305,1.5754,5.024,0.4087,5.1462,3.0683,8.5525,0.2141,0.0212,0.5097,2.0321,3.9842,2.1729,0.2878,0.9786,1.1156,4.9213,6.4313,2.3977,3.3425,2.5191,1.102,1.1041,6.6468,2.1882,4.8432,0.0011,1.5277,1.2331,4.3479,8.2865,0.1622,2.2078,1.4018,0.9587,6.2487,0.3135,5.767,3.0806,0.0042,1.4259,5.8363,0.2695,2.9729,1.758,4.1301,2.9797,2.6817,1.0085,7.98,0.2719,3.7065,0.8133,4.7447,5.7649,0.4817,0.4948,3.6946,0.0261,1.557,0.0009,2.0116,4.3459,0.9338,3.3844,2.9226,1.753,7.2689,1.6136,2.1483,2.7138,7.5329,0.1379,0.8377,0.1814,5.0426,9.4876,0.3411,2.0272,7.8829,2.2163,7.8879,6.2728,6.9299,2.0606,6.7847,0.8888,0.8586,3.9266,0.0421,1.359,4.9693,2.4778,6.6245,0.9543,4.3699,6.8047,0.9663,2.1147,0.1331,2.509,4.1564,1.2649,1.87,10.3894,2.9016,1.8795,1.5487,1.4025,3.6111,0.1641,4.2598,2.2697,2.4449,9.4347,0.1042,1.2763,3.6343,1.1491,0.9622,4.2444,2.9551,0.3027,1.992,7.3477,2.8488,9.735,2.1368,1.1157,0.5979,0.182,3.4657,4.7466,3.4506,2.4718,2.8292,1.2442]}

In 1876, the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey to find who owned the vast amount of land in Ireland. The government created a form of taxation based on landholdings. It called the \u201c Irish Land League \u201c. Members of the Irish Land League wanted to make Ireland into an agrarian society again. They did this by raising the price of land and creating laws to favor land ownership. Many people did nothing, but others took up arms. They were called the Irish National Society and the Irish Land League. The National Society won the war. From 1882 until 1918, the Irish Free State was formed from the Irish land owners. Land was not taxed anymore. The only way to get your land back was to take it from other citizens. The Irish Free State was the most conservative country in the world. Many laws have changed since then but there are many people in Ireland who do not agree with them or even want to leave. The Irish Free State has seen many changes. When you live in Ireland, you can go to a pub and watch or play some sports. You can even watch live horse races. In Ireland, there are four seasons. One of them is the Summer where everything is green.

{"id":2449,"ended":true,"length":234,"text":"While Kenyon's teachings on overcoming faith laid the groundwork for the prosperity gospel, the first generation of Pentecostals influenced by him and other figures, such as Bosworth, did not view faith as the center of their religion. The first generation of Pentecostals focused on physical, social, and emotional needs, while avoiding a Christianized view of sin, salvation, and heaven. Some Pentecostals have sought to establish more traditional versions of the faith; however, not all contemporary Pentecostal denominations, such as the Jehovah s Witnesses, adhere to early 20th-century doctrine, although some groups, such as the Full Gospel Business Men s Alliance and the Church of God also known as the Pentecostals of Christ, adhere to earlier versions of the faith.\n\nThe most famous Pentecostal theologian of the first half of the 20th century was Ellen White. Most Pentecostals today accept the New Testament teaching of baptism by immersion in water for the remission of sins.\n\nEllen White Pentecostals may have been more closely associated with the faith of the first century Christians than with the theology of the second and third or even first generations of Pentecostals. White s work continues to be influential, particularly in Pentecostalism; however, her theology was theologically conservative, which many contemporary Pentecostals reject.","token_len":282,"entropy":[10.3587,3.715,2.5437,9.4916,2.8901,7.1973,5.9381,10.0998,0.885,1.2955,0.0612,1.7379,8.7271,3.5008,0.5908,2.2266,4.8419,3.8642,0.3541,6.1598,0.0143,0.0,0.7518,7.9797,3.4747,3.0299,3.9877,3.6204,7.5725,3.6916,3.1208,0.0015,9.9007,1.9705,0.8372,5.6996,1.0417,4.9965,2.6601,0.3045,2.4089,5.0138,0.0677,1.4125,5.3688,0.4833,3.1638,2.9296,0.7582,0.8863,0.3984,0.0019,0.0002,0.1195,4.4865,0.3521,7.4742,3.3458,3.143,0.4993,0.6004,2.5473,3.426,1.274,2.1347,8.3171,4.2398,5.6009,5.2296,2.6442,0.0984,6.3018,2.1251,5.6226,0.1159,0.3164,6.6965,0.3205,5.099,1.5223,0.0047,0.0006,0.2127,5.0628,5.2395,0.2903,4.8648,5.1211,3.1765,5.7833,0.0368,1.2189,2.6334,5.3802,3.5309,0.0222,5.6405,0.2236,6.2155,0.3173,0.0017,0.0009,2.9983,4.8695,3.7923,1.2911,0.001,0.5748,5.6747,10.8684,4.3749,0.448,2.8167,0.2546,7.2735,6.968,0.0009,1.1423,0.0341,5.578,3.0367,4.2122,1.4517,5.5166,2.5972,0.1738,0.0012,0.2743,10.4551,2.464,11.6592,6.8815,7.6988,7.9961,2.7825,0.5184,4.0315,0.2173,2.7248,8.3322,7.1712,0.0071,0.5844,2.5759,0.0299,0.0012,1.3125,1.5783,3.671,0.3579,3.0705,0.1207,4.2074,2.6826,0.4309,0.472,0.9895,0.1748,1.1428,0.0009,1.9559,4.9446,3.4544,1.7043,0.0015,0.0009,0.0728,4.5655,0.0194,2.0744,0.397,3.9114,2.1701,0.0277,0.0063,0.5592,0.0029,0.0195,1.3974,10.4763,5.6275,2.7679,5.7911,2.6538,0.0031,0.0018,0.3676,3.9303,4.6394,1.2441,4.5559,0.165,3.4386,1.5648,4.971,3.6172,0.2022,2.3174,1.1672,3.5775,1.0837,2.3287,0.0127,0.0826,1.5099,3.9872,0.0002,4.5498,0.0001,0.2041,8.8368,0.0074,0.0006,1.9665,6.2093,0.8228,1.1938,3.7547,5.1199,1.0308,0.0174,0.942,5.2587,1.6647,1.0214,2.6952,4.1477,4.8952,0.5922,1.4777,0.6299,5.3687,0.1955,0.5026,3.5133,2.4802,0.2602,6.6586,2.4659,5.4839,3.7952,0.8336,0.1459,0.0013,0.0011,0.0484,0.3393,2.8252,9.0091,5.337,6.2709,0.531,1.7017,2.6832,2.6391,2.8147,0.8269,4.6504,0.01,0.0006,0.0638,4.583,4.994,1.7188,0.0147,1.7474,4.5208,2.7945,4.8753,4.6102,4.2178,1.7811,3.673,4.9305,3.7647,0.0767,0.002,0.0077,0.1777,3.7056,0.5286]}

She also explores the `` silencing `` of under @ http:\/\/adf.ly\/k2OqB a ting feminist historians, feminists, and other `` outsiders, ` ` by mainstream historians who dominate the historiography of their disciplines. Other events include an alternate history of the Spanish-American War; the American revolution with America lost and the American Revolutionary War fought with Great Britain, and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe book also examines how female and minority voices have been marginalized and excluded by histories written by men. For example, Clarke examines the way histories of black American women were written by slaveholders and enslavers. Historical accounts of female victims of sexual harassment have often been written from the point of view of the perpetrator. As the author puts it : `` Although much effort has certainly gone into collecting and collecting and publishing women's voices, and because women's voices have undoubtedly been a part of our past all along -- in the home, on the land, in the factory, in the schools -- these voices are generally not well known to the wider and more historical community. \" ( p. 5 ) Clarke also discusses the exclusion and marginalization of native Americans. The historical record was rewritten in many ways to erase the native presence in their lands.","token_len":282,"entropy":[9.6975,2.811,2.9647,9.0096,3.1948,7.2988,3.2776,1.0762,10.2553,6.7224,7.1839,2.9137,2.6951,0.7591,4.7349,2.2642,0.87,1.6957,2.2329,1.2387,3.2685,4.3028,0.0284,0.8115,4.7185,2.9632,2.8771,0.962,14.0678,16.1636,1.5024,5.239,0.534,8.3235,17.3203,7.522,0.0228,7.042,5.7201,1.2565,6.9628,0.0314,6.0191,3.9762,5.2192,3.4463,4.556,7.3637,6.4498,7.5674,11.9766,6.8972,3.0867,6.5743,0.7609,1.0482,3.1876,9.7866,7.7059,3.0549,5.4199,5.6138,4.7556,8.245,1.7506,2.7846,8.0562,0.8872,4.486,0.0764,0.2822,0.9634,5.6804,5.0576,0.5788,6.1972,5.943,2.1703,3.7584,7.0727,0.2859,0.6273,1.1206,4.7439,3.2867,0.1251,0.1044,3.9285,1.6394,4.8199,4.6494,4.873,6.1213,7.7436,2.5153,1.8973,3.7402,5.4543,0.1103,6.3377,3.5509,5.7689,0.008,2.3806,2.8837,1.0009,6.3668,0.176,4.6764,0.0137,1.317,2.8779,0.1676,2.5212,2.5628,2.5888,3.1876,3.1075,6.6154,3.8881,2.3168,2.6829,2.3732,0.8136,2.4583,1.8364,4.2854,2.4724,7.3454,4.8864,0.6825,1.9696,0.9248,3.3366,0.2612,0.052,2.4786,3.1811,0.8173,4.6602,6.8103,0.7087,4.1522,4.6232,1.2579,2.4958,2.2764,2.0933,7.678,1.3359,1.398,12.1791,0.2901,0.0322,1.5973,8.1493,2.0849,0.6263,4.3791,5.1068,0.5201,4.3718,3.6489,3.7506,2.3993,0.8278,2.6719,4.5694,1.0223,2.6344,0.0109,0.0096,0.0276,1.8646,5.3007,1.2792,4.1549,3.0552,1.3675,2.84,0.0066,6.1092,1.7605,6.9988,5.7002,4.0859,0.4567,9.5208,3.1522,0.0167,7.2209,1.4873,5.4965,2.9105,4.6523,4.2522,0.4099,4.7283,0.7277,3.6516,5.3647,3.0436,2.3408,0.5441,1.3223,8.4586,0.3947,3.5327,2.8811,0.0161,3.4161,4.2532,6.489,2.2626,6.3201,3.6236,2.1586,6.572,0.6384,2.9254,0.3348,6.5272,0.1315,1.228,0.9837,5.8748,0.3671,0.7916,0.7052,3.485,1.5578,3.9466,1.651,1.576,5.5468,2.0579,4.7402,3.4509,1.9292,1.3855,3.7546,7.2592,1.2413,7.4448,1.4262,0.726,6.0395,2.3747,4.348,0.1109,3.7698,2.8176,2.7532,2.0572,2.6783,0.8659,5.9566,2.2504,2.6107,0.0219,0.1617,8.4521,3.453,2.9057,2.7259,6.1035,2.8978,5.32,6.6545,2.1739,3.2211,0.4128,1.6747,5.9964,1.6082,2.5876,6.4322,1.9504,4.5814,4.1874,1.1011]}
{"id":2380,"ended":true,"length":255,"text":"In 2008, Warner Bros. Entertainment released Watchmen Motion Comics, a series of narrated animations of the original comic book. The first chapter was released for purchase in the summer of 2008 on the iTunes store, and the next twenty-four installments became available for download around the corresponding year. These stories were animated, directed, and narrated by Damon Lindelof, with the voice talents of Tim Blake Nelson (Ozymandias), Patrick Wilson (Nite Owl II), Billy Crudup (Edward Blake) and Adrian Veidt ( Ozymandias ). The narration was delivered by Alan Tudyk. In 2010, it was published in a softcover version.\n\nFor the following nine years, Watchmen has been one of the most important and influential titles of the superhero genre. With all those years of evolution, some fans were wondering if a Watchmen live action movie could ever be produced. In 2009, the New York Film Academy opened a program in which students would create an adaptation of Watchmen in the style of a short film.\n\nLast year, we found out that there was a movie version of the long awaited project in the works, and Warner Bros. have now announced and set a release date. At long last, we\u2019ll see what the Watchmen comics are really capable of, and whether or not we really need more than one film per graphic novel.","token_len":282,"entropy":[8.3722,0.1895,8.0495,0.3113,0.1167,4.3767,2.6173,7.6005,0.1316,11.614,9.4824,1.3392,1.1774,3.9512,0.4162,11.2069,7.7462,3.8199,1.3628,3.6041,3.2931,1.1404,2.1449,1.4423,2.3168,6.2058,1.8041,1.8374,4.0003,5.0838,1.099,2.4044,4.0686,0.032,2.2741,4.0592,1.9822,4.8937,0.8698,2.0232,1.0118,1.3956,3.4416,7.556,0.8415,1.3024,4.552,6.2045,0.3117,1.2116,1.7563,6.6736,0.3996,13.8892,3.3445,0.3986,5.0664,5.4795,1.1709,5.5273,2.5122,5.9946,0.8574,0.2979,4.061,0.5009,7.6615,0.4237,0.0003,0.0,1.067,3.4188,1.93,4.8189,3.2728,0.0855,5.2626,5.3137,9.5033,2.2812,6.0633,3.2081,2.0075,0.0011,0.0004,0.96,5.4205,2.6051,0.2521,4.8618,7.9896,0.0127,7.6282,0.3705,6.7841,3.9097,0.0354,0.0113,0.1509,9.359,6.1633,2.359,0.0768,6.6883,7.5364,3.5684,0.166,0.1828,16.2024,0.0154,0.0033,0.0029,3.0933,1.4045,8.4542,1.4161,5.0685,0.6871,5.7729,3.6672,0.0,2.5322,2.9596,2.8999,0.0875,4.5764,0.1757,4.4116,1.2805,2.7804,7.2483,0.0922,3.7168,2.5593,0.9984,0.0034,4.8215,1.6502,4.0134,4.2641,0.429,0.1813,1.3844,0.0087,2.8215,1.0209,3.9216,0.0044,0.2834,0.6763,3.8324,2.6831,2.0506,5.0789,1.2999,0.7699,5.5341,0.4744,0.6053,3.9383,5.0096,4.7723,1.5147,0.7444,6.3623,1.0078,5.1188,2.741,2.7747,2.9474,1.3981,4.0754,4.4438,0.0986,7.7353,2.329,1.3793,1.3004,2.0313,1.6387,3.3314,0.6017,2.8198,3.4358,0.0738,1.8852,6.435,0.1675,3.8772,3.8544,6.1651,1.4686,5.6893,3.1824,0.8226,3.4908,2.5069,3.9784,3.1426,4.9538,0.1407,1.4799,0.0127,3.329,2.2862,2.2081,0.0679,2.6418,4.7709,0.8977,0.9336,3.14,0.0002,6.1195,0.5895,0.1772,4.5517,4.8465,0.3247,0.352,3.812,0.9977,0.8396,3.883,5.6543,0.1573,2.2493,7.6634,2.0463,5.783,3.3591,0.8768,0.2055,1.8563,1.9167,4.8582,0.0593,0.0848,6.1727,3.6891,1.4185,6.5677,6.7381,2.1553,2.1213,0.0329,3.3843,5.2195,8.5929,0.0065,0.1151,2.0175,17.461,8.7049,3.8978,2.1698,1.7671,1.923,5.4785,0.0181,5.5674,2.6529,4.6441,3.9008,0.0022,2.5552,0.7417,3.7886,1.5851,0.0024,2.0071,5.0022,2.405,4.1297,3.2926,1.8519,4.5454,6.7025,6.8737,0.01,0.4765]}

The fishermen claimed that six of their fishermen were arrested at Nagamar, a fishing hamlet in Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu, on October 1.\n\n\"There is no information and that is why we have asked both the governments to clarify what all measures are being taken to ensure safety of Tamil fishermen in Sri Lanka,\" he said.\n\nLast year, after killing of four Indian fishermen and arresting several others, Sri Lankan President Mahindapala Sirisena had issued a statement saying that fishermen from Tamil Nadu should not venture into the island nation's waters.","token_len":282,"entropy":[4.9,7.1432,1.8649,4.3778,7.7495,6.4942,2.1372,5.7593,0.6652,8.8909,0.0112,13.5067,2.4194,3.7555,3.9204,0.0909,11.5102,6.5879,0.2056,8.0691,9.7608,4.5317,1.7105,6.1462,7.8854,4.7481,2.9072,7.0161,1.9737,5.6912,0.222,0.058,4.9645,6.7032,1.6292,6.7257,3.3659,1.5506,3.6027,0.7156,9.224,1.0769,5.7813,0.8934,7.2176,0.3668,3.7918,2.3385,1.6748,6.0169,3.8244,3.5241,2.9458,0.0894,0.8052,6.7557,0.4141,1.0931,4.1825,5.3705,3.727,0.2731,1.515,4.8594,3.4452,1.4087,0.955,6.6863,5.4909,1.7892,2.8503,1.7428,2.8213,2.347,1.5871,4.5511,2.3581,1.6136,3.9675,3.3636,0.622,4.9143,7.3723,2.3159,0.5344,8.6003,2.3893,7.5051,0.3602,0.2647,0.8066,0.0286,5.0778,2.7756,0.7616,1.3112,2.1615,1.8554,7.9443,5.8593,4.7068,0.0052,0.0227,0.5102,3.9744,8.8041,3.0978,3.9018,0.0946,2.9457,4.1741,2.8992,7.5857,4.3674,1.256,4.9267,0.0004,3.2394,4.5351,1.8684,7.1944,3.7251,0.8558,1.0897,1.9989,0.0048,0.0171,0.2766,2.0387,1.0695,5.222,2.8002,1.9381,5.1177,3.5873,3.5734,0.3664,2.1447,1.8085,5.0917,3.2444,2.0144,2.1878,3.1408,2.1172,5.5989,12.6722,3.5486,8.5628,3.6825,5.8794,2.8847,1.6184,7.7738,3.1326,3.1106,0.1678,1.173,5.3797,2.3686,4.0371,0.0634,1.047,2.1982,2.5689,3.2237,0.3346,5.3043,0.9603,1.7306,3.1206,0.655,2.5213,3.5621,5.5765,8.0409,3.7721,3.0292,1.5799,7.138,0.0082,1.2217,4.193,4.7765,5.2412,1.6551,0.7579,1.5943,1.5888,0.4837,0.0017,1.8562,2.2297,1.4003,3.0237,0.8514,1.7654,0.0001,3.0649,3.062,1.1234,0.457,4.6633,4.9026,6.287,1.1754,0.7449,1.0298,1.2552,3.6049,5.8044,0.7443,6.7975,1.0874,4.1129,2.9485,6.4563,7.7926,0.8165,2.3979,0.0406,0.6291,1.7549,2.2266,0.6439,6.8911,3.3179,1.944,2.6692,0.1592,0.6358,5.5136,0.3312,0.263,1.1515,0.0002,4.7657,1.0713,0.5389,4.726,7.2486,3.1344,3.1244,4.8576,0.0654,3.1839,4.4474,4.1494,0.9166,0.7651,1.2061,0.5411,0.0087,3.9947,0.9266,6.6317,14.4458,3.7767,2.4431,0.1593,0.0021,2.2426,3.7402,0.4779,2.7245,1.13,0.5501,3.4426,2.3113,0.9923,0.0098,2.8913,1.3444,5.354,1.0988,0.8232,7.7003,3.3148,3.3606,0.3546,0.7998]}

{"id":1719,"ended":true,"length":260,"text":"Originally, seventeen sectors along the Normandy coastline had been selected as possible invasion sites and each were provided with a code name taken from one of the spelling alphabets of the time. The code names were derived from the initials of the location, with a leading 'C' being the first letter of the name, while 'B' would be the second letter, 'D' the third and 'A' four times (so for instance \"Cobham\" would be \"Codham\"). For example, \"Pompignan-La-C\u00f4te \" would be \"Codhamla\" because the letter 'D' was used first and then the letter 'G'. Following the initial wave of troops (i.e. the tanks, artillery and infantry), and perhaps a subsequent follow-up to recover those who may have fallen behind, the other eighteen sectors were occupied by infantry units. Most of these troops were part of the 2nd Irish Division which had been formed specifically for the operation ( and had previously existed in North West Europe where they had fought in all theatres of World War I except the Caucasus). On 29 June 1944, these troops were landed on Omaha Beach (also known as \"Hobart\" to honour the Governor of the Isle of Man). Over the next 48 hours, the 2nd Irish Division was deployed in France in a number of defensive positions within their sector.","token_len":282,"entropy":[3.3302,13.0666,10.2457,6.7142,0.3278,9.4909,3.4095,2.6864,0.8699,5.0205,1.9967,4.3933,9.2692,1.5006,3.8995,5.1038,4.1581,5.582,0.2795,1.0605,8.0045,2.1925,9.4735,0.0999,3.9354,0.1292,0.4206,11.3288,7.1593,1.569,0.3431,0.0909,3.0528,0.7303,5.1109,0.7833,1.7692,2.5532,2.1873,0.8704,4.4192,0.0746,0.7586,5.373,0.6684,0.5844,6.5646,1.8465,3.4727,3.2739,6.323,3.8514,4.6883,0.1333,1.8174,1.4533,2.7426,1.6017,0.9125,0.5332,1.7633,1.3958,2.3372,1.8908,3.4521,0.0237,4.1154,0.7593,0.4369,1.0426,0.453,1.9524,3.9064,2.8373,0.2544,0.871,0.1023,1.3925,1.4927,2.2748,0.025,8.5572,3.1834,4.5944,5.2046,4.4259,2.1902,4.0506,3.5135,5.713,5.4226,1.3979,1.4736,0.4772,1.7628,6.3155,6.6314,1.9113,4.5427,1.9493,0.3885,1.9694,5.364,6.0468,5.1348,2.3566,5.6219,6.3914,1.7678,3.3494,5.1302,0.262,8.1485,1.6504,0.3187,0.7822,1.6223,0.9712,11.0076,2.1034,4.7687,1.7787,5.1668,2.177,5.099,0.0214,1.143,2.1865,5.519,2.532,2.3491,1.6586,1.37,0.2886,3.9906,2.8961,6.5219,0.9815,4.0746,7.3931,0.0959,5.9114,4.7845,4.903,0.0021,0.0009,0.5757,1.1948,9.1786,1.6078,1.9387,0.9605,2.9758,1.2098,4.6875,5.8929,2.8878,4.3442,8.4843,0.2211,0.1088,3.5475,9.1869,4.8115,4.3252,6.7331,0.2161,3.0335,4.7121,0.7152,0.9001,6.7096,7.0882,0.5936,0.9457,7.4527,0.8819,3.8755,2.4762,1.5154,5.986,0.5617,1.1189,5.6355,0.8071,5.827,0.1078,0.5625,5.8786,0.3726,7.9825,3.1711,3.0198,1.7922,1.2004,2.5382,7.4775,1.4497,0.7889,5.1535,3.9766,8.346,3.6797,4.5119,6.0294,1.4513,5.1814,4.0016,3.8179,5.8586,2.6695,0.9681,4.1304,1.748,5.9683,5.2208,0.0144,1.1126,5.8396,0.0086,0.9395,6.0237,1.9761,9.5606,1.5086,4.5374,5.1848,2.4289,1.7636,0.5585,5.1872,3.1853,1.0287,6.7442,1.739,8.0469,0.8674,2.7724,4.7816,0.5598,0.0572,1.9787,3.9984,4.2313,1.3329,2.5365,5.2168,7.1859,0.7316,7.7257,0.7661,2.0983,5.4968,0.0505,0.966,2.9725,5.356,0.8989,0.33,4.5312,0.0398,0.6024,1.4585,3.8977,0.0108,0.2653,0.402,1.9489,3.8844,2.6482,4.2263,4.3655,2.1082,2.4981,0.0016,5.2494,1.295,5.7091,5.3049,5.4166,1.5451]}

{"id":4697,"ended":true,"length":254,"text":"The skull, measuring 59 @. @ 6 cm ( 23 @. @ 5 in ) in length, was proportionally shorter and deeper than in any other large carnivorous dinosaur. The lower jaw bone, known as the quadratojugal, was also proportionally shallower than in other known carnivorous dinosaurs, accounting for the lower jaw having a much broader, convex shape. This is an example of convergent architecture, where the overall body shape of a vertebrate animal is adapted to a function, such as herbivory in dinosaurs, water breathing in sea turtles and land living in gharials. In some instances, such as sharks, crocodilians and pterosaurs, the convergent design is relatively minor, but in the carnivora group it was a more significant adaptation. The tooth count, which ranged from 13 to 17 at the back of the skull and 17 to 19 on the front jaw, was similar in size to that of the largest known carnivorous theropods and had relatively small roots, small rootlets that do not have any serrations on them. This would lead an expert to conclude that the teeth were relatively small and blunt or had very small serrations, like crocodiles. They were also long and slender, with thin teeth without visible enamel on them.

The Irish Literary Theatre produced a series of plays including The Fairy Queen, Yeats \u2018 The Dead Poet\u2019s Society, The Plough and the Stars and The Kingdom. A number of leading actors, directors and playwrights were connected with the theatre. Yeats, Lady Gregory, Martyn and Moore worked together and set up a permanent theatre and artistic establishment on the grounds of Kilpeck Park, Kilpeck, County Wicklow. Following the death of Yeats in November 1922, Lady Gregory became the sole administrator until her death. In 1925, as work to erect a permanent structure for the Theatre was in progress, a storm hit the area and the site was badly damaged. Yeats, Martyn, Moore and others worked in the ruins to create the Theatre. The first production staged under the direction of Yeats and Lady Gregory was Macbeth. The theatre was rebuilt in 1928. The first productions staged were by Yeats and Lady Gregory including The Druid \u2019 s Theatre in 1930. Both Yeats and Lady Gregory died in October 1937 and the Theatre lost its artistic status.

{"id":3545,"ended":true,"length":263,"text":"Depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years. Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, even into their 50s.\n\nMost horses will be a much happier beast in their 40s and beyond. It will take time, but these horses will have time out of the pasture and their needs will be more realistically managed. This will give them the chance to enjoy companionship with a human without becoming overwhelmed.\n\nIf you, as a horse owner, make a habit of taking your horse into a pasture and leaving it every day, you will quickly burn out and turn into a nervous wreck. You will worry more about your horse than the animal. The horse will not understand.\n\nThe most important change is to stop allowing your horse to make decisions for itself. Instead, leave decisions until the last possible second. Give your horse the sense that you are in control even when you are not.\n\nIf your horse has been put through a period of life where all decisions are being made for it, you will gradually lose control of the situation.\n\nThis period has come to an end for most domestic horses. They have become mature and it\u2019s time for them to be taken on a new path.\n\nThey will still enjoy companionship but they will no longer be an appendage.","token_len":283,"entropy":[3.3456,9.2701,0.8504,9.6734,1.209,4.4157,0.3094,1.9791,8.6313,6.9069,5.9011,2.1707,1.6268,4.905,0.5498,0.181,4.5899,1.6127,0.9931,0.04,0.6632,12.3866,1.8389,0.6016,3.1714,4.8518,4.3529,3.5415,5.1738,0.2918,2.1608,0.17,1.7239,8.2982,4.9761,0.0237,1.9598,2.3825,0.2309,0.8197,0.0055,0.3929,1.16,0.0006,4.56,2.0668,4.191,2.0704,4.7257,7.8027,3.6922,6.843,3.1964,2.1095,1.737,0.0148,1.6751,3.9264,0.9138,4.0125,2.6256,3.6337,2.8415,2.1629,2.5309,5.6014,1.6955,1.1085,3.0534,5.0191,7.2589,0.4628,1.7162,5.9653,1.726,4.175,5.6879,0.2887,0.6363,4.7536,9.7705,5.7911,0.4418,3.972,1.9925,3.0399,0.3543,2.1759,2.6363,0.0422,4.0059,8.7208,0.0065,2.3291,3.169,4.5951,5.7987,4.316,5.5444,2.0252,0.7132,0.0002,3.9121,0.5388,6.1791,2.0962,0.4277,1.9748,0.5166,0.1835,5.9865,1.0885,4.9876,0.0531,3.7555,1.9152,1.8391,3.116,2.532,2.3538,2.1923,5.9627,0.8083,7.128,0.9486,0.8362,0.9867,0.6717,5.1839,8.3583,1.0102,2.0548,5.8764,1.0464,0.4404,7.9256,0.9752,0.2535,2.4361,0.5298,6.8083,3.0852,0.1995,1.6364,0.4964,1.927,2.9234,4.0698,2.3538,3.3208,1.8117,0.8042,3.2293,3.8189,3.9481,1.3733,0.0002,2.7359,3.5659,0.9781,6.5833,2.4348,1.1235,3.9157,6.036,0.7759,0.3851,0.1321,5.0485,2.9632,2.4012,1.8868,0.5239,3.8878,0.6273,6.5794,8.0452,6.9438,1.6709,4.6786,1.6929,3.0297,0.6011,4.7556,0.599,0.2894,1.5714,6.9634,0.714,1.4889,1.2405,3.9363,0.4375,7.1029,1.5279,0.9628,1.3226,0.4407,0.2439,1.3045,0.0002,2.9428,1.3959,0.2299,2.4336,2.3513,5.7026,1.3383,1.5706,3.6927,0.1243,5.0147,2.8287,5.4452,3.7415,0.921,3.0636,0.2145,1.5193,1.5638,0.3605,1.5022,0.8624,5.7417,1.9544,1.5229,1.4498,2.3039,2.8552,0.389,2.1332,0.0002,3.4743,5.7579,4.7985,4.6836,0.7436,0.3201,0.0302,5.2775,2.3062,3.6957,0.3777,0.4968,2.477,1.9115,2.3952,7.4393,1.1883,5.8515,19.8376,7.1842,2.2127,1.4025,1.2251,0.8133,0.0233,2.8942,3.4338,4.5842,1.8209,1.8526,1.6034,0.3325,0.651,0.0002,5.3857,1.1615,5.4174,3.5642,3.3319,0.0051,3.0061,1.2623,0.173,3.1788,0.0048,1.2261,5.622,8.2658,0.0014,2.7041]}

{"id":1612,"ended":true,"length":253,"text":"The Middle Colonies were the religiously diverse part of the British Empire, with a high degree of tolerance. The Penn family were Quakers, and the colony became a favorite destination for that denomination. Pennsylvania became the second-most populated state in the Union thanks to immigration. The native population included Algonquin, Oneida, Lenape, Iroquois, Montagnais, and Susquequoian people (see map below ).\n\nWith the beginning of the English Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, Pennsylvania, like many other colonies, was faced with a need for a skilled workforce to supply the new factories. Penn and his Quaker friends decided to put their faith in science and create an institution to train young men to support their own families and prepare them for a more prosperous future. With their wealth and Quaker ideals, they were well-positioned to succeed. As the need for labor expanded during the second half of the 18th century, the colony was ready to provide the workers that would help in the construction of railways, canals, and steel mills.\n\nPenn College was known as \"Penn's College\" and was built on a hill overlooking the Schuylkill River and Valley Forge in Pennsylvania. At the time, education was quite popular. Over 60 colleges and universities were operating throughout the United States, providing opportunities for young men to better their lifestyles and their futures.","token_len":283,"entropy":[8.8703,10.3211,0.1934,4.7278,2.9297,11.2569,3.2792,5.861,0.0105,0.4736,4.4556,0.6811,1.2587,2.8814,2.1655,4.5052,1.9993,0.0063,3.6034,3.3591,1.9498,10.5384,6.7177,3.8369,10.317,0.1839,0.8789,1.1306,1.5415,7.2153,4.0781,1.4025,7.056,2.3881,0.4182,7.6381,4.2309,0.8605,7.5497,2.3942,1.1399,3.1592,1.7159,1.5075,2.6613,0.195,0.7212,0.3617,2.3819,8.9547,0.138,5.412,1.6947,1.9189,6.1333,1.3991,5.7027,6.8477,0.5274,1.0133,1.8128,9.3379,0.0147,0.136,8.2102,2.8606,0.3173,5.4038,0.0005,0.008,0.0771,5.2103,1.0331,0.1219,0.1389,1.6762,5.8959,0.0175,12.6864,4.1403,1.8962,3.6314,4.1902,3.4541,1.9765,1.6376,6.9032,0.9966,0.2604,5.5069,1.0626,5.3278,0.0143,0.3316,4.8609,5.9489,0.011,1.5073,2.2714,2.5433,2.2077,0.1553,0.1434,2.347,4.8009,2.6618,1.4837,0.8474,3.7561,0.3934,1.5965,5.525,0.0205,1.033,5.9778,0.6679,1.7844,4.6337,0.8389,2.6845,4.4357,0.9223,3.8903,3.7422,0.9514,5.5804,3.3624,0.5786,7.183,1.5296,2.2991,4.2342,0.278,5.0929,1.8219,2.7331,0.134,6.1584,0.7397,6.8462,2.4696,3.553,2.3512,2.6843,3.3394,1.5055,1.0564,6.8237,1.3409,4.3555,4.2705,2.4436,6.6496,0.2546,0.1765,2.8124,3.8247,1.222,0.6699,0.1196,4.608,3.4961,7.8704,0.8661,11.6127,0.0669,3.6459,0.3286,1.8616,3.265,5.2171,1.4411,1.2431,0.0002,0.2304,3.9959,1.5943,4.1091,1.6843,8.5224,0.2326,4.4729,4.5448,4.4768,0.1198,4.6808,0.3683,0.0018,0.0056,2.6159,0.2037,0.0281,0.0859,1.4599,4.9437,2.4355,4.9239,0.4323,3.0637,2.0579,4.5206,3.8326,2.4815,3.2406,5.5524,1.0054,3.0748,0.3225,7.3348,0.9386,7.3977,0.0321,0.0579,0.9092,6.7722,0.4007,0.1628,1.0403,0.0003,1.2874,6.5674,1.5669,6.0587,0.5548,2.0263,1.9816,2.3469,1.7825,0.8322,2.242,1.1034,4.0171,1.7865,2.0478,2.9657,1.4907,0.5785,8.1262,0.9162,0.0019,0.0013,0.1156,3.0449,9.5229,1.9687,2.5882,2.2583,0.4297,4.8384,0.7668,0.6875,0.5396,7.4375,0.5102,5.5292,5.5709,2.5688,5.9363,5.237,3.7766,1.99,0.1839,0.7378,4.9963,2.0548,0.9041,2.2525,0.0283,1.2965,4.0115,5.1294,0.202,2.5949,0.9079,0.6436,6.2127,2.3451,9.0072,1.0231,4.4062,2.9337,0.2096]}

Benzodiazepine abuse is mostly limited to individuals who abuse other drugs, i.e., poly @ - @ drug abusers. On the international level, the most frequently abused benzodiazepines (BZD's ) are clonazepam (CZP), lorazepam (LOZ), and diazepam (DZP). Lorazepam is widely available in Europe and Asia, and has gained a significant demand in the United States, in comparison to other BZD's, and is a significant and major threat to public health and safety due to its high abuse potential. In the United States, lorazepam use is currently highest among patients in psychiatric and substance abuse institutions, as well as prison inmates, and among those incarcerated for violent offenses. Among individuals who abuse other drugs, BZD abuse contributes significantly to the overall incidence of addiction, and is a major cause of dependence (American Psychiatric Association ). At this time, lorazepam is available in various formulations such as lorazepam tablets with a strength of 3 mg, or lorazepam suspension tablets and oral solution with a strength of 3 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg, as well as lozepam suspension gel for injection with a strength of 3 mg ( Allergan ).","token_len":283,"entropy":[8.1375,1.7064,0.3363,2.821,3.782,1.1792,0.4304,6.664,4.1825,0.9529,0.0713,1.64,5.8573,0.0141,0.0004,2.4847,1.9255,0.9063,6.5827,4.7677,0.08,3.132,1.1258,3.6113,3.693,0.7219,1.6354,6.1484,0.0015,0.0009,0.3722,8.3029,15.3663,5.3184,7.1897,5.7231,2.0925,0.8465,5.7418,0.3128,8.1817,0.7437,0.1306,2.3857,3.3996,3.1291,1.1913,3.9433,0.0023,0.0003,0.2644,3.1464,4.8254,2.9286,2.099,4.4308,5.2325,0.3675,6.4363,1.7182,0.307,0.0022,0.0007,1.6376,2.8555,2.1318,3.6385,1.2092,4.511,0.1847,0.0033,0.0001,0.0006,0.1265,5.2038,1.7709,0.3249,1.2025,2.9389,0.0286,0.0004,0.1508,0.7156,0.6545,0.7553,0.2218,8.5399,0.0031,0.0002,0.0044,1.0433,4.126,3.9466,1.1725,2.2472,1.2846,2.824,1.1436,1.3553,3.0841,6.5828,2.6656,3.3435,7.0883,0.8658,0.5996,0.7362,0.0186,2.6191,4.8516,5.8455,0.5013,1.81,5.5531,0.0583,0.3346,0.1853,3.1996,2.5372,1.4777,3.4973,4.6476,4.675,5.9902,5.106,0.1411,3.2125,0.171,2.7566,0.8136,4.9456,0.0084,0.345,2.0667,4.005,0.4547,0.3855,2.7263,1.7987,0.3927,0.0552,0.1912,4.7333,0.0026,0.0012,0.0002,0.003,4.6073,0.8678,4.8029,5.0857,0.5221,4.5796,3.4041,4.9432,3.6181,1.6748,0.263,6.5273,1.3651,3.2213,1.2467,0.0054,9.1731,2.6071,1.8559,1.4336,3.5801,2.4904,3.8097,1.1791,5.0593,1.6261,0.4553,5.2042,3.8251,1.4138,2.5328,1.8672,0.601,0.3543,5.5043,0.0074,0.0157,4.0794,7.4765,2.776,0.0555,0.754,2.9995,3.0319,0.0656,5.019,1.6052,1.5504,1.8889,1.8697,0.7276,1.9842,0.064,4.2072,3.8264,6.4892,0.3014,0.0373,5.1776,6.0607,3.5497,0.4644,0.1152,6.092,0.0043,0.0026,0.0003,0.0018,1.5968,4.8781,1.2178,4.45,2.7288,5.5887,0.0019,3.3457,0.1886,0.0728,0.0862,0.1181,4.1375,4.971,2.3235,6.9294,0.5817,3.9477,2.1565,1.5842,2.2847,2.5322,0.0174,0.0138,0.0021,0.0184,8.9883,1.252,4.0755,4.3163,6.2549,1.4348,0.3922,0.112,0.0052,2.2829,0.2019,1.7879,7.6342,0.109,0.2034,1.8182,0.7897,0.008,1.4215,2.9241,0.109,0.0013,9.2055,0.0201,4.865,0.0026,4.7639,8.8702,5.0853,3.7516,2.9764,1.6326,0.1621,0.0095,1.9096,0.0597,3.505,9.5643,1.4487,0.1769,2.0669]}

There are other important, 20th c. recordings of noise (by people like John Cage, David Tudor, Pierre Boulez ). Noise was also used by composers who were not themselves associated, in any way with experimental music. John Adams, for instance, and I remember playing some of his music for my experimental composition class as a teenager. There are probably plenty more examples. The use of noise by contemporary music composers and performers is relatively few as compared to the use of electronic music making by today's performers.\n\nDoes this mean that we need to re-examine the notion that experimental or avant-garde music has to be (primarily) electronically based or has to use any instrumentation other than orchestral. I find no compelling reason to do so. The use of noise can certainly be a part of electronic music - whether that means to be a part of the creation of the work, as a key component in the making of the work, or simply to be a part as part of the listening experience.","token_len":283,"entropy":[3.7898,9.6936,4.5537,8.9298,0.0911,0.8264,4.2621,0.0384,8.2964,4.2433,2.4953,8.9826,0.0095,17.5466,7.8761,4.4924,11.6117,3.6175,4.7838,3.8888,1.3897,3.0177,3.2364,0.2569,0.0622,0.7365,6.7642,1.5242,3.3464,1.6378,8.4448,4.7875,5.7227,1.715,2.9366,8.1688,4.9384,8.4269,5.7842,1.4575,6.9793,5.7773,6.5357,7.0702,0.4638,4.9852,7.5629,9.0461,0.0787,6.1027,0.1892,3.6134,5.6608,2.117,2.918,2.845,0.5384,0.6309,1.5888,1.8872,3.0224,1.778,5.0915,0.9512,4.8119,0.0181,7.4799,0.5035,11.4845,3.2171,2.634,5.6982,1.5407,4.3559,4.2612,3.8201,8.5785,0.0433,0.5886,0.5318,2.7814,1.2209,4.8487,3.7214,5.9875,5.5215,1.6361,4.5374,4.4191,0.8889,4.3212,10.6844,0.1493,0.4349,5.9328,5.4899,2.2273,9.0775,4.8114,1.2288,2.292,0.4509,2.7764,2.7738,0.0014,3.3867,1.8547,2.4924,6.4183,8.4141,6.8172,3.5972,4.4062,0.467,6.1475,2.4883,0.1811,0.7275,5.3283,6.8177,2.5702,1.8717,1.4051,0.0785,5.7056,6.4506,6.1705,4.3372,3.6888,0.5816,0.6953,2.8768,3.5615,4.1058,7.4236,6.1258,2.1889,4.7845,1.2167,2.8412,0.6466,3.9361,1.5389,5.2332,5.6536,2.1802,3.3072,2.2977,2.7367,4.0145,0.0175,0.7248,2.4879,6.2263,3.557,2.9588,0.0014,2.6166,3.6169,1.1576,6.3204,5.4677,5.0443,3.5171,0.221,0.898,1.5415,0.1092,3.9557,0.5054,8.3727,2.4809,5.8605,0.0188,4.8996,0.4412,2.6749,0.6943,7.3926,2.2273,1.0522,0.5092,2.8487,2.4031,0.4194,4.3048,0.3495,2.1222,0.0027,1.0403,5.407,1.8128,3.6032,6.7773,5.7198,0.0023,0.6887,0.1541,0.0019,0.1676,2.9254,2.3044,0.4338,7.0485,7.5269,0.0084,0.1693,8.3202,4.8986,2.7275,5.2785,0.2225,4.8719,5.5085,6.0598,2.681,2.7966,0.0046,6.7562,0.1288,0.0001,4.5228,2.8187,4.6554,4.0944,5.0866,1.678,0.586,4.1063,0.5485,0.5645,2.2755,3.7097,0.0201,2.4307,4.1095,3.3686,0.788,2.9944,4.1724,0.0134,5.621,0.1513,5.977,5.1954,3.5538,2.4683,5.6301,3.736,2.0273,4.2855,0.0363,1.9071,6.8273,0.405,2.7418,5.475,1.4627,3.2061,2.8377,6.8978,2.7567,2.2632,0.9637,5.4287,0.1549,1.4549,1.2768,0.3077,0.2117,2.5175,1.5994,1.4005,1.4839,1.476,7.8366,2.4188,0.0332,0.5745,6.2584,0.8338,0.5547]}

Both monikers, Coliseum and Memorial Centre, remained in place until the current CBA, allowing both teams to keep their original names.","token_len":283,"entropy":[8.4367,2.4339,4.8924,6.1899,3.6693,5.1295,4.3049,0.028,2.9317,2.2783,8.6137,5.4026,0.9709,2.0046,1.744,0.9138,5.8477,0.0009,0.0009,3.8907,1.6803,6.9839,7.402,0.0089,0.0125,3.1954,7.4409,2.6871,1.024,3.3285,6.0965,1.3354,5.7628,7.0834,3.3118,0.0038,0.43,4.3733,0.004,0.0102,2.4113,0.8263,5.0261,2.2939,9.4617,3.6764,3.8612,4.0812,3.3982,1.6407,6.0148,5.3535,2.1371,1.6229,6.2834,2.7515,11.2827,1.3991,2.3494,1.1891,0.1403,7.2689,3.8682,1.5033,0.1907,0.4348,6.9109,4.4285,3.3327,0.888,2.9456,0.7772,2.79,4.5371,0.0019,0.0189,7.2234,1.3971,7.7918,0.0171,6.9428,1.9892,7.5329,0.0049,0.3916,0.5088,3.3117,0.0026,0.004,3.2139,0.0972,0.3937,4.8299,6.6016,2.991,0.0019,0.8957,1.4109,3.7917,0.9782,3.0963,0.003,0.0042,0.3969,0.3004,4.1988,10.1608,6.6763,6.0974,3.7099,9.068,2.1915,6.7914,7.4248,2.4613,0.6407,1.7337,1.2342,1.1969,0.0006,2.1877,2.3216,0.0029,0.0233,8.1059,6.9187,1.5588,5.7833,1.9582,0.9911,5.8894,2.1889,1.9317,5.6526,0.31,1.38,0.2494,0.7286,2.3872,3.2432,0.0205,0.4144,5.4558,0.0001,1.5707,1.7329,1.1058,2.3414,0.4217,0.0009,0.0041,6.1162,4.6569,2.1073,4.5022,0.278,2.9083,0.0331,2.3452,0.7516,4.6139,0.0047,0.2886,4.3659,3.3689,0.4944,4.8794,0.3638,5.9045,0.8143,0.0322,0.7476,3.6463,0.9628,0.9886,6.1049,6.2846,0.0474,5.8094,0.8177,0.3827,2.1749,1.4426,5.0298,1.1046,0.49,6.7384,0.0668,4.579,4.8756,1.2173,3.4669,6.6946,4.0874,2.3784,5.0053,0.2168,3.2547,0.6657,3.6454,4.4639,3.5064,0.9251,6.8007,8.1066,0.0023,0.0946,4.4918,6.4978,2.8185,0.4757,3.6293,0.1095,1.3075,5.4939,0.0864,0.0023,0.0047,0.1648,3.3888,3.5417,5.2858,0.3429,5.4792,3.3259,4.5018,1.651,4.83,3.1818,3.3695,0.5436,2.6453,3.0026,0.6075,2.3233,2.0303,0.1871,2.2858,0.0024,1.437,2.2524,3.9181,2.6729,1.8311,0.7427,3.1118,4.4128,2.1762,2.235,3.8103,2.0899,1.4719,5.4811,6.4071,1.0181,6.9903,6.426,5.3451,4.3832,6.6316,0.3035,1.8677,1.4274,0.3296,6.1123,1.2072,1.4175,0.9115,1.0263,3.585,7.8766,3.0594,3.0616,5.9356,4.6429,3.515,0.1474,5.2241,0.9122,3.6108,1.7846,0.457]}
{"id":4010,"ended":true,"length":261,"text":"Plasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized. A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one helical motion on the surface of the plasma. The number of such motions defines the magnetization. It is known that, while the net field is an attractive force, it can reverse the charge distribution through \"quenching\"; i.e., it can remove the net positive charge from a region. For example, a negatively charged region near the plasma surface will become more positive if the net plasma field is strong enough and the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the plasma surface (thus, the polarity will rotate by 180o from that of the net magnetic field); the opposite will occur for a region near a net positive charge. To reduce the effect of quenching on charge distribution, a plasma may be partially depleted by a \"depletion field\" that also repels ions and electrons. Depletion and rotation fields can be independently applied to a region of a magnetized plasma.\nA further effect of the plasma is that it strongly biases the potentials of the region it encompasses. The bias typically goes to zero at the interface to the ambient gas (or other plasma-depleted region) and increases exponentially with distance. The term \"plasma potential\" is used to describe the potential within the plasma.","token_len":283,"entropy":[9.6141,7.6978,2.4211,6.3672,0.3126,8.1245,0.0038,0.0314,6.4039,1.0775,5.1626,0.0683,1.2666,5.7785,0.2238,2.2045,5.3193,0.0054,1.1584,6.8851,2.4147,2.0782,3.7526,5.5641,11.3589,6.654,2.3514,1.1214,2.4643,2.3159,5.8612,5.4347,9.3172,3.5231,0.4094,1.3757,9.1751,2.2893,2.6985,3.3867,2.0968,2.6333,0.1958,1.2632,2.0015,0.9896,2.1009,4.8499,0.0602,3.0423,0.7191,9.4217,0.4319,6.6407,1.3804,4.9334,3.7714,0.4058,3.1049,0.3053,3.9884,4.614,1.3181,7.1947,5.7296,2.4202,5.8943,5.0289,2.6758,0.6502,1.0591,2.4635,8.7073,0.8713,4.8002,2.8684,5.4375,7.2123,6.643,6.0156,0.0753,6.1797,4.2434,0.0069,0.0042,0.1229,2.0217,1.217,5.7269,1.3046,3.8002,6.0939,0.9823,1.4378,1.6951,6.9954,2.4868,3.8625,0.9962,0.0401,1.7245,6.6259,0.0186,5.3841,5.7737,0.6321,1.5186,4.1054,2.5742,4.1575,3.0815,4.3034,3.1503,0.8599,3.3686,5.2796,1.1513,0.5544,3.7263,0.1759,3.0691,1.2391,2.4907,0.1074,0.341,8.4812,5.8799,0.1644,0.3441,1.4069,1.8607,3.2995,6.3027,1.961,1.6527,7.2798,0.0171,3.7344,6.796,5.654,5.9605,11.8224,6.3659,6.0523,3.1334,0.3193,4.4449,3.8852,0.032,4.1022,2.2007,3.9713,1.4582,2.5264,4.6105,0.5817,4.7435,1.7433,3.0197,5.9749,1.5456,1.2465,0.7831,4.7061,4.3725,0.4202,4.9875,0.0983,4.0689,0.006,0.0024,1.4225,4.6384,0.5827,0.4387,2.1703,2.9862,3.9892,0.5641,6.1426,4.1894,1.5093,1.9146,5.2181,6.4421,1.8246,0.0069,4.0113,0.8499,2.3267,5.8458,6.3945,0.2519,3.6255,2.0775,2.0347,0.9443,6.445,0.0832,0.0854,4.3311,6.5713,6.2227,2.1772,0.9859,8.5251,3.3385,0.4987,2.0221,4.38,1.1267,2.5477,4.2619,0.7159,0.2615,1.0897,2.6364,10.3606,6.5073,5.9031,0.3491,2.115,1.8062,2.3991,1.1918,1.3803,7.5082,7.1988,0.4608,6.0761,4.0137,0.296,1.5496,8.4639,5.4067,7.6694,0.6675,1.988,5.9273,6.5837,6.07,2.8494,2.9889,2.9339,0.961,7.2773,5.286,0.8556,8.2385,5.8526,3.0584,3.4321,3.6986,3.9545,3.15,5.0559,0.3258,0.4289,1.191,0.8608,3.6511,3.8143,1.4417,2.4519,2.4178,1.7672,6.7217,0.4846,7.3638,0.0332,6.9332,0.3186,1.0056,1.6882,0.7801,0.5476,0.8433,2.234,7.1567,1.3534,1.1721,1.9015]}

{"id":824,"ended":true,"length":265,"text":"On 6 December 2007, it was reported that Clarion Solicitors, representing Gordon Park, said that they would launch an appeal. In a public statement, they said : The appeal is against the [court] decision yesterday that Mr. Park has a right to apply to the High Court to have his sentence, of 14 years, reduced. There is no doubt, the prosecution is well within its right to ask for a higher court to investigate the background of the original guilty plea but the defence has every right to challenge that decision, especially where the grounds provided make no sense. Clarion also indicated that they would challenge the conviction. Park had previously been convicted for rape in 1999. Following the initial hearing in June 2007, Magistrate Dona Gradi had said in her ruling: In light of the fact that all those he lived with for some years were his mother and three brothers \u2014 and that the mother was the one to admit to the police that her son raped her daughter and was in the process of divorcing him and in the process of moving out of the family house \u2014 I don\u2019t think there is any doubt that he [Park] is guilty of what has been described. The appeal, therefore, will be held at 11.00 a.m.\n\nOn 9 July 2008, the Court of Appeal ruled that the conviction of Park as well as the 14-year sentence would stand.","token_len":284,"entropy":[7.3575,2.8322,4.4337,0.3749,4.9904,0.3994,1.1079,0.2823,11.1741,1.1064,9.225,1.9234,0.0485,2.1257,6.8837,9.1638,6.9682,1.1746,4.7491,1.4772,2.6781,1.994,5.9971,2.1677,3.1438,4.3471,3.2984,1.7054,5.7732,0.3949,0.5967,2.3532,0.5076,6.0704,4.3363,4.4007,1.9731,4.418,0.7458,5.978,6.6583,1.7226,1.451,6.5166,2.2413,5.2137,2.3733,5.1078,3.1905,3.6808,1.5404,0.1795,5.4451,1.8921,0.631,2.1329,0.0069,2.1409,2.1652,1.4402,6.6113,5.5883,5.9522,5.9364,0.539,1.5111,1.1496,1.8423,4.5866,0.6746,0.6335,2.9717,3.4155,3.9114,6.6334,2.2227,4.6507,3.6159,0.286,2.6116,0.5159,4.5012,1.4659,1.3431,5.3236,3.9463,1.9635,6.4557,1.4593,7.8228,0.743,1.2317,5.9255,6.4351,0.6914,5.6934,1.8688,5.2394,1.8802,6.4066,0.5809,0.1271,2.3777,1.6722,1.2094,3.0796,3.8334,3.563,1.3244,6.2354,7.6536,7.6117,2.7892,1.4483,1.0856,7.8485,0.0013,4.3555,4.4678,0.1985,1.8192,0.984,4.7017,0.5512,4.1692,2.9615,10.202,3.1135,2.2637,1.658,2.1096,2.993,4.4973,1.7158,4.1646,1.6277,5.8659,0.8334,4.9892,2.6616,1.7491,3.2162,1.3606,0.2575,9.6616,0.1954,6.2613,5.6985,6.0609,8.712,4.6974,3.2253,3.7843,1.4957,1.7493,2.7619,3.5501,2.8667,0.0007,0.4316,3.2327,0.0592,5.5011,4.383,7.6262,10.6739,0.0534,5.1892,4.2246,2.4584,1.5682,4.4026,6.7828,1.4592,5.0161,2.112,7.2323,2.9187,1.5698,2.2361,5.0258,1.4743,2.671,2.5039,3.2622,7.0838,2.315,1.2204,7.2541,0.9952,3.3889,1.3379,3.1403,0.2562,5.0606,2.6155,3.2942,3.8251,1.884,1.6779,0.0071,4.3432,0.0027,2.8505,2.9014,5.2723,1.9203,0.0944,0.0966,4.0756,1.135,0.5902,1.0599,1.6462,4.0984,0.7961,2.7322,5.4325,15.3849,8.9016,0.6629,1.0784,2.0938,0.8058,0.6358,2.4012,0.2918,1.9577,5.3916,0.2608,0.0528,2.0664,1.1946,0.3011,4.6468,3.5733,0.3866,1.088,5.5362,2.3057,3.7913,3.7466,2.1456,0.0349,2.0777,0.8511,4.9379,3.4018,6.8945,1.4695,1.6904,1.8977,0.0033,0.0004,0.1652,4.487,0.0045,4.1102,2.8944,3.582,1.3311,0.1244,1.6548,3.6703,0.3233,0.0367,1.9363,0.472,1.4052,3.8551,1.99,1.817,5.076,3.8647,0.011,1.0019,6.4086,0.9056,0.0437,0.3776,4.1777,4.5326,0.7949]}

{"id":1047,"ended":true,"length":266,"text":"Survivals from late Medieval church fittings and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even compared to those from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the early Reformation, when surviving pieces were quickly incorporated into Christian worship or reused by churches, or destroyed completely.\n\nThe history of a Christian church building may seem quite straightforward, with services and sacraments occurring regularly year-round, but churches did not always survive the long period between their creation and abandonment. Buildings fell out of use, were destroyed in war, were stripped for their valuable materials, or were demolished and replaced by other, later buildings.\n\nSome buildings remained in use for only a brief period before being dismantled. The use of surviving church fittings in later Christian worship may be a reflection on the short duration of service in those buildings; in other words, the church might have functioned as a temporary structure during which services were conducted, or more likely, that church was in the process of being replaced with a larger or more permanent structure that was already built.\n\nIn any case, no church fittings that survived the Reformation ended up in parish churches or private homes. The use of some Christian churches for purposes other than Christian worship was particularly common in Scotland, and included both the Scottish State and the English Crown, but church services in many buildings ceased more than a century before their abandonment.","token_len":284,"entropy":[9.8224,6.1379,8.2293,6.8127,8.4488,14.5429,0.0025,2.3112,8.1054,3.856,6.3025,4.4381,8.3823,1.0365,7.1114,5.6423,0.2182,2.4901,2.4073,8.6815,3.3656,4.1031,2.472,2.0567,5.0427,2.016,7.45,0.7414,1.1389,0.8038,9.0948,1.3778,0.5332,2.313,6.1319,3.3496,1.1385,2.3175,8.5037,0.0075,3.017,3.121,7.2668,4.122,1.1227,5.2341,7.1049,0.2358,6.3543,5.9722,4.3175,4.9934,2.5225,3.289,3.2353,3.1655,5.273,3.7601,0.9486,0.9829,0.0055,2.0314,6.459,0.1009,4.9161,4.766,1.8087,4.8183,4.1484,3.4987,4.4543,4.734,0.9621,3.8262,9.2679,2.6915,5.9488,0.0631,0.0302,6.2018,3.4559,6.8662,2.2974,0.0819,1.275,1.0415,6.5227,5.7172,0.5284,2.7089,3.1241,2.1563,5.7436,2.5563,3.9269,3.8132,3.4916,0.3859,7.1559,0.5921,7.8425,7.0505,1.9696,0.1898,1.4306,2.1423,3.8818,2.6763,2.8571,3.62,0.4551,1.9348,6.5003,6.3804,3.1201,5.6207,1.9035,0.4152,0.8257,0.5728,3.9951,2.9867,1.8365,0.9558,1.9334,4.0662,5.3537,2.6935,0.6759,1.7414,0.0002,4.0671,2.7888,4.1623,1.6073,0.7029,1.3626,5.7631,0.2517,4.4306,0.8435,2.6687,0.7551,4.3794,1.795,2.3171,5.7518,0.0552,7.1641,2.3913,1.7134,0.0003,2.5882,5.0577,3.0386,6.0177,2.0955,2.1116,2.3199,3.5299,4.4254,0.6598,6.6775,3.3248,0.2006,5.6581,3.3455,3.2734,1.991,4.715,3.4623,3.1365,0.8871,0.0368,1.5847,2.4199,3.4004,0.8491,6.207,0.0018,1.9981,0.3104,3.0675,4.9012,3.8184,3.4482,5.3224,1.3587,4.3501,2.0598,2.3991,5.0495,1.357,1.1409,3.9834,3.3749,4.3841,4.2917,3.0953,0.617,0.003,0.3407,3.7006,3.8053,0.9101,3.166,3.5885,0.8133,2.1849,0.9365,3.3588,1.9072,5.5467,4.0718,0.7052,0.5729,0.0002,2.8617,3.6839,0.5193,0.0216,5.446,2.756,6.8528,0.0005,3.6541,1.881,1.5295,2.182,0.0001,6.2182,0.0302,0.717,7.5936,0.7122,1.9711,6.4835,1.1738,1.2066,2.1464,4.266,0.0432,5.4267,4.9717,1.707,2.3925,5.7321,0.6696,0.0036,4.557,0.4352,2.3401,6.2622,1.5617,1.3925,2.8712,1.1001,1.4395,7.6499,4.6661,2.7215,7.0477,6.9197,1.1772,1.0953,3.7962,2.8335,1.6963,3.1832,4.4451,3.6106,2.5739,3.9185,7.1848,6.4469,6.4975,1.22,0.4731,0.7117,2.3524,3.0381,2.3348,0.3576]}

The story was later withdrawn by the newspaper, while a spokesman for the Home Office said that, if Salvia were to be illegalised there, they would be working towards placing it in the schedules of Psychoactive Drugs. In 2006, however, Home Office minister Lord Faulkner, said that banning Salvia divinorum was not under consideration. In 2008, it was reported that the Home Office had considered applying to place Salvia divinorum on Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Act because the substance is claimed as to have hallucinogenic qualities. The Home Office later stated that it planned to leave Salvia in Schedule 2. On October 26, 2011, the UK Home Office announced that Salvia divinorum would remain in Schedule 2 in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. In addition, the Home Office also said that an expert panel should be appointed to review all active and scheduled psychoactive drugs.

{"id":4300,"ended":true,"length":250,"text":"Several missions were proposed to demonstrate methods of landing the Gemini spacecraft on land. The spacecraft had originally been designed to land using a paraglider and a set of skis or wheels, however, Gemini lacked the capacity to land itself. Although the first two flights used the \"ski-and-wheel technique,\" later missions used a two-stage approach in which the third stage was fired only at the end of the runway to allow for gravity assistance. The first stage was a smaller rocket named the MIMS (Man In Mission Support), the second one was MIMS+ and used the larger Agena.\n\nThe first three missions were:\n\nGemini VI\n\nGemini VII\n\nGemini IX\n\nThe landing on the Sea of Tranquility on Gemini VI was the first manned soft landing to be performed on a planet other than Earth. Landing site selection was a problem during much of Gemini's first two years. Even when selected for the first half-dozen flights, landing areas were subject to change at the last minute because of delays. The landing site selection problems resulted in a number of changes in missions and landing area sizes. For Gemini VII, the landing area doubled to cover the western and southern areas, and for XI, the landing area tripled. For Gemini IX, the landing areas for IX and X were reduced to better fit the areas of interest.","token_len":284,"entropy":[9.654,3.0198,7.819,2.1983,5.9329,8.3934,1.0757,7.2075,2.9777,8.972,1.4909,1.3839,3.5816,1.4339,1.6751,4.4749,3.0661,5.0209,0.3628,2.6138,0.5184,1.6384,5.7655,1.0841,8.7104,5.2655,0.0344,0.6853,2.319,2.6807,6.9415,0.0416,7.169,0.8151,5.0473,4.5816,1.5423,5.7003,0.5888,5.9365,6.9864,1.005,5.3728,0.4102,1.6211,5.0622,1.4936,5.0107,1.0482,3.9478,3.2297,2.5743,5.8139,1.9446,5.0234,7.3395,2.1711,5.9558,0.0162,1.0132,7.1457,0.7027,4.2335,2.9486,2.8794,1.5918,5.4789,0.064,1.8712,3.4974,4.7189,0.2429,0.6226,8.0095,0.1008,2.1171,6.4665,5.969,1.6093,0.9096,3.9255,0.0347,0.5574,2.5095,3.2471,2.5046,1.5847,8.0044,5.9865,0.5037,1.7935,2.2038,4.2997,1.606,4.3068,5.5598,4.2627,5.8618,0.5818,4.6288,6.1995,3.3938,3.2916,4.2694,4.2155,6.5967,6.1981,2.9589,4.058,0.4611,3.7092,1.2684,6.5977,0.7141,0.3398,6.8169,2.755,7.532,2.0442,5.2489,9.1991,1.2972,4.1692,1.844,0.0036,1.4747,2.1526,3.8149,0.8925,1.1643,6.9222,0.3645,0.0002,3.8834,0.3445,0.0051,7.4503,3.5161,0.0003,0.6492,0.0333,0.001,0.4172,0.1906,0.0002,0.3238,0.0091,0.0005,3.2011,0.1055,0.0002,2.9195,5.2173,4.1005,1.3594,6.928,0.156,2.9685,0.0226,0.0382,3.3142,3.3873,2.6075,0.95,2.5151,0.7334,3.5929,10.1443,0.1407,5.1371,1.8042,1.8812,0.959,1.0182,3.9224,4.4037,0.0042,0.4485,0.3916,6.369,7.6369,2.7238,0.924,3.1885,4.1523,3.6288,7.0301,0.0192,1.528,0.5741,3.6023,2.8733,3.0027,2.2532,6.4733,3.4289,5.034,2.1255,1.78,1.8182,7.5896,3.8762,2.3319,2.4856,0.4866,4.2209,4.7577,0.612,6.4429,0.0086,2.8578,3.4095,1.8431,1.8375,0.3191,3.7766,0.3491,4.9999,2.7682,1.9861,2.7206,2.2409,1.0926,5.2086,3.5206,0.1306,2.0515,2.6342,0.0022,3.6701,2.0855,7.1526,2.3175,4.6417,5.0468,4.7166,0.7347,3.297,1.7255,1.5532,0.2547,1.1181,2.5227,0.9536,8.045,1.8929,5.7838,1.9536,7.3985,3.1969,1.2552,5.1229,2.2324,1.5218,2.9196,12.3059,1.0335,0.689,0.8263,0.1394,4.7948,1.5896,3.1094,0.3908,1.3765,0.1456,0.506,0.7927,4.4772,3.7735,7.3588,1.7513,1.7976,0.6034,2.7397,0.6572,7.0699,2.7491,0.6311,6.3374,1.7192,1.3172,0.9554]}

The album was originally planned to be released in late 2010 through the label Hopeless Records, but was later delayed due to difficulties with the album's production.

The album sold only 1,500 copies on its first day of release, less than half the 2,000 copies the band's first album sold on its first day.[3][4]\n\nAlthough most rumors speculate that the band was disbanded, all current members of Saosin signed an official statement that Saosin would continue.

However, the Flyers offered him more than $4 million dollars for the coming season and that was too big a pay cut for Vokoun, who chose instead to remain a free agent. His father was a fan of Russian hockey team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) and the Flyers were rumored to be one of the clubs where Vokoun might be offered a deal in hopes that he would make his home in their country.","token_len":285,"entropy":[9.7199,1.6466,2.7991,3.9356,9.9418,0.6896,2.019,0.5765,7.5199,0.0287,6.9227,2.2383,6.0149,0.344,3.0773,4.0482,4.9864,1.9495,2.3562,4.7644,6.5092,0.217,4.5014,0.1771,0.9394,1.2192,0.6746,5.3301,3.5592,1.7284,1.0415,11.4353,0.0026,6.0347,0.1116,0.0,0.0001,0.3756,4.2455,1.4631,3.9433,4.7346,1.7428,4.845,2.083,3.5679,6.2135,0.1042,4.4332,5.059,3.9778,1.9591,8.0075,1.6616,0.0832,0.747,0.4129,0.0025,4.4474,4.4981,0.0418,6.5066,7.6101,3.5448,4.5705,2.8077,0.0002,0.155,7.249,9.5771,1.4105,4.0449,3.99,0.5848,1.5862,0.3505,3.8767,3.2181,4.4159,0.0272,2.4263,2.9735,0.3319,0.9291,1.5939,5.2757,0.0717,0.4851,4.4632,0.0094,0.9921,5.579,0.0107,0.4195,0.7687,2.6912,3.6189,0.8325,3.3578,0.126,0.8032,0.4194,3.2812,2.6009,2.1452,3.3028,0.1964,0.7258,1.1703,0.0002,2.2094,0.1021,0.0017,5.0877,0.919,4.4233,0.0015,8.3029,0.0043,4.0832,2.9736,0.6871,6.589,6.5676,0.0278,6.7408,7.5284,0.1246,0.0106,0.0024,8.021,0.0968,2.2975,0.0396,0.1369,0.0005,0.7778,3.914,0.3883,0.0423,0.0582,0.1778,5.2387,3.298,4.6199,9.7493,0.1667,1.2084,2.7711,6.9751,1.7497,0.807,4.1186,0.6853,3.7852,3.5852,3.6914,4.6033,3.4165,4.3418,6.158,1.6033,0.1326,3.6712,3.3321,0.6867,0.5261,0.1597,0.826,0.0006,0.0016,1.7904,6.1611,1.3216,3.2496,4.4093,2.3312,2.7322,3.8791,3.7769,0.5598,2.3661,0.0014,0.4741,2.6431,0.3185,1.8124,0.0446,1.9967,1.4631,4.5865,0.7022,5.0968,0.5577,1.1275,3.1811,0.3727,4.7573,2.4398,0.8836,7.0753,0.2386,1.7841,3.5447,1.6427,4.6839,6.1104,1.8111,4.3451,1.0234,0.8369,2.5438,0.0004,0.0017,2.8249,0.5683,6.0812,4.0965,0.0083,3.6959,2.4436,1.495,0.0139,0.8024,5.0387,6.3553,2.9725,1.309,5.5689,0.2736,6.4492,0.7146,6.236,6.1612,0.0022,0.0122,0.001,0.8549,0.0073,0.012,6.1213,0.7168,3.6827,2.2792,0.016,0.0012,0.0454,0.038,2.7318,0.4206,0.2829,1.335,0.4486,2.705,2.1718,1.8644,4.9068,0.0272,0.4682,5.396,0.0283,0.3856,3.2089,4.825,1.1838,0.0006,0.0025,4.2237,1.6376,4.5602,1.0986,2.3287,3.5126,5.851,1.901,0.7276,0.495,3.1871,3.052,5.2803,0.5456,6.5679,4.9203,0.4118]}
{"id":2990,"ended":true,"length":247,"text":"The military campaigns undertaken during Domitian's reign were generally defensive in nature, as the Emperor rejected the idea of expansionist warfare. His most significant military contribution was the development of the Limes, a vast, semi-circular defence system constructed along the Danube River. The Limes stretched over a considerable distance, encompassing present day Romania, Bulgaria, Western Macedonia, Serbia and southern Serbia, Greece and Turkey. At the same time, the empire had lost the advantage of a long coastline to its southern neighbour, Parthia, and the two sides fought a bitter 20 year war during the reign of Trajan.\n\nTrajan had already begun construction of fortifications along the Danube River, which was threatened from all sides by the Parthians and also by the Goths. To cope with these various threats he first extended the Limes in his own territory, but after his conquest of Parthia he established the system much further south, on the Danube bank itself. A further project, the Dardanelles, was begun by him in the Parthian Empire. The construction of the Limes was a mammoth task, and according to Eutropius involved building more than 12,000 forts in the span of 20 years, with Trajan personally supervising the whole process. It certainly shows the lengths that he would go as emperor to keep the empire safe from their enemies.","token_len":285,"entropy":[7.8112,8.8377,7.2657,2.7755,11.7909,2.3112,0.3038,0.3053,0.6271,1.7085,5.7513,5.8958,2.5459,0.0886,0.7743,3.0378,2.0339,5.206,8.4191,1.4974,3.1821,0.5104,8.6542,2.7315,3.8767,1.3783,4.1946,4.6631,2.9288,1.6764,6.7123,0.6418,0.977,6.6139,0.0441,1.1152,6.9977,10.5345,2.4771,1.1366,5.5563,2.888,5.7045,0.0213,3.5591,0.0047,9.752,0.8357,5.3053,4.2246,0.5642,4.6077,0.0011,1.0313,1.2755,1.6762,1.0636,0.0045,6.676,3.073,2.3475,4.4144,2.0023,1.6572,4.3875,0.008,9.3001,2.4289,3.1239,0.8189,1.7716,0.2497,7.4955,5.7132,0.3481,3.8248,1.3462,5.3469,2.3588,1.7843,8.1435,1.0958,3.8123,0.3224,4.7579,0.6917,1.5703,0.002,0.225,0.9242,4.7197,3.3414,5.3609,2.8827,5.1196,0.1842,3.1703,3.2671,3.6057,3.2563,3.4526,3.5705,1.6842,1.0324,9.246,0.3718,0.7514,1.5136,1.7425,5.8874,3.7937,3.3245,2.8026,2.8207,9.4606,2.4342,0.4345,4.9528,1.628,2.9522,0.0399,4.6039,0.012,0.7153,1.4419,0.01,3.4998,0.0014,3.1923,3.712,3.3795,3.6302,0.5517,7.4852,0.2524,1.7449,0.216,0.3141,0.004,1.1108,1.3874,2.2197,3.4928,7.065,4.5325,3.3781,0.2767,0.5621,0.7071,6.5874,0.5479,0.2591,2.0186,5.2408,0.7198,0.5654,5.2934,0.0257,0.81,4.7696,4.4825,0.2232,2.0388,7.0693,1.0653,3.3786,6.6266,7.0305,0.7349,2.2306,0.0258,4.2752,3.3503,3.1269,1.1759,1.1138,2.9295,3.8852,3.5247,4.1703,0.5812,2.2002,0.0065,1.9077,4.9763,2.204,6.4212,7.3358,1.0969,1.3425,1.5572,4.6657,0.1911,1.8854,0.0084,6.0503,8.0407,0.3664,4.5035,3.1547,5.4478,2.1654,1.8802,4.6826,3.6755,0.1464,0.0156,0.0066,0.5902,0.973,2.9621,2.2067,4.6139,1.291,1.7044,7.6029,0.0808,0.1743,2.841,2.0755,1.7667,3.8575,0.2089,1.2192,2.9135,0.0162,1.176,2.8904,7.4933,2.9934,0.7425,1.867,6.3605,0.0016,7.3158,5.2529,1.4747,0.3794,9.2673,3.7069,3.7054,0.1858,5.0596,0.3461,0.0701,8.4511,0.0131,2.9739,1.5455,7.3977,0.0047,5.4872,0.0947,1.6553,2.9241,11.0459,0.0019,5.5979,4.3809,0.0002,0.708,4.8223,1.7431,0.1766,3.5428,7.5092,6.5723,1.5997,5.2213,2.5778,2.9391,2.6746,0.4073,6.0661,7.2908,2.1844,3.9549,0.8586,2.3019,5.0189,0.9949,6.4822,3.3471,0.4526]}
{"id":841,"ended":true,"length":232,"text":"The name Giacomo Meyerbeer first became known internationally with his opera Il crociato in Egitto \u2014 premiered in Venice in 1824 and produced in London and Paris in 1825 ; incidentally, it was the first opera written by a man to be commissioned by a British company (the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden). It is thought that Meyerbeer (1795-1868) was inspired by an incident in his own life \u2013 being stabbed repeatedly in a barroom brawl outside the theatre where his opera Un ballo in maschera (1819) was premiering. Meyerbeer escaped into a nearby coffee room to recover.\n\nHis later operas \u2013 Told in Three Acts (1832) and Ulysses (1863) were similarly inspired by the poet Alfred de Musset\u2019s work ; as was L\u2019heure espagnole (1867). Meyerbeer\u2019s most successful opera was Le proph\u00e8te (1872), based on the biblical story of the same name. Meyerbeer wrote many sacred works, including Masses and settings of the Psalms. He was known to have a fondness for his wife Fanny, a former actress. He died in Florence and is buried in the Santa Maria Novella cemetery.\n\nGiacomo Meyerbeer\u2019s operas were often performed in Paris as well as London and Venice.","token_len":285,"entropy":[6.9627,11.2652,2.3379,0.0883,9.7355,11.1027,6.3639,3.1952,1.6365,7.5289,4.7156,0.483,7.4103,9.1423,12.4472,5.4101,3.4375,2.6075,13.4886,8.773,6.7814,9.4872,0.4293,3.9567,0.4779,1.7675,5.0087,2.0794,5.9484,2.6496,3.0341,2.6459,1.4889,1.9512,0.6636,3.2115,9.9046,9.2014,0.2854,1.9886,0.7814,2.1805,1.4257,0.9946,4.4606,1.0614,0.989,2.7244,5.205,1.648,5.7084,1.1072,1.5136,4.0803,4.6038,4.0777,2.3833,4.6357,0.3565,0.3314,1.8351,6.9633,0.5787,0.0009,2.3225,2.9393,2.0192,4.8821,0.3703,2.201,0.0359,4.9779,4.0727,4.1686,0.345,0.0672,5.0475,0.2386,1.2233,4.0954,0.1896,4.3461,4.85,0.7613,2.3587,2.9917,0.6387,6.3733,5.8562,5.6586,5.3317,1.3842,3.2493,3.7158,3.6147,5.1185,5.4879,1.7736,4.4821,4.4197,2.8052,2.6406,8.9559,11.1065,2.3358,4.2721,11.561,6.6792,1.0242,1.9907,3.1484,4.0256,0.3379,0.3231,8.1695,0.7685,0.7396,3.844,0.01,8.0706,5.2466,2.5807,3.1765,6.5802,5.7496,2.9564,4.3233,2.8244,1.3655,0.019,4.0303,5.1979,3.4301,0.0271,4.1149,5.7743,6.4724,2.0912,5.2257,6.0548,1.2672,0.4924,4.4411,1.3617,0.1807,6.7326,2.7871,0.0002,0.1219,0.1142,6.0621,0.2609,5.5064,5.9736,2.7283,0.4573,1.5088,7.8243,5.6275,5.7883,8.7243,2.3769,12.3206,8.3411,4.617,3.7721,9.6263,4.3018,4.1596,6.6463,15.0013,2.6411,7.1967,5.8317,12.123,3.7589,0.9659,0.7983,0.4279,4.0273,1.6209,2.9636,0.018,10.14,0.303,0.3701,4.1647,4.2723,1.5113,1.1995,5.9055,6.1977,5.6347,3.1322,3.7496,1.5981,0.3342,3.4256,0.9066,4.416,0.1044,1.2949,7.2908,1.6087,0.2127,1.8294,5.9454,0.1263,0.9825,4.1714,0.0092,5.238,3.9414,10.5571,2.7825,1.1809,0.4985,7.2461,2.7731,2.239,11.5389,2.6656,1.8828,4.8293,0.0555,1.5038,2.0327,1.9951,3.3757,1.605,1.2589,3.2248,4.4792,0.0138,0.0235,4.6987,4.7493,6.6025,2.2638,1.3799,2.7014,4.4419,5.2482,2.1706,2.6353,3.0321,0.5821,6.5633,5.5008,3.1157,0.2413,0.4455,1.3547,7.5423,0.4374,8.4247,4.0267,1.0928,2.6481,1.071,0.5742,0.0003,4.7023,3.3402,0.0178,0.4393,0.13,3.7822,0.0174,0.3614,4.4641,0.0247,1.9451,3.3664,2.3993,1.3245,5.2716,4.2884,1.4618,0.6907,1.6291,1.6398,3.5982,0.6831]}

{"id":2500,"ended":true,"length":248,"text":"The earliest < unk > ( flag @ - @ like objects ) used in Poland were known as stanice and probably resembled the Roman vexillum, that is a cloth draped vertically from a pole. The early stanice were used by Poles in a much wider sense including both the Polish lands of the Middle Ages and later the Polish partitioned Republics, including the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic ( see for instance ). Stanice were often decorated with gold plaques. In some cases they were put on pinnacles in churches and castles.\n\nThe term stanica is also used for other related type of flags, which were not only draped on pinnacles of churches and castles but on buildings generally, that is often poles in city and town centers where they were draped to form a rectangular flag. The Polish word stanica was used as a general term for all such flags. In Polish stanica always means more than one stanica or the more widely and more commonly used in Polish staniec ( ) which means vertical flag.\n\nThe word stanica was also used for the red flagpole where the stars or other insignia of the kings of Poland were borne.

Vettel overcame pole - sitter Alonso in the final lap of the race after a thrilling three - way battle, the German driving his Ferrari to its fifth pole of the season. It was Vettel's eighth win of the season. Fernando Alonso did everything he could, starting the race from the front row and leading the first 21 laps, but Sebastian Vettel, starting from the back, fought his way through the field to claim his first and only victory in his home race. Webber started on the front row alongside Alonso. Hamilton had set the race pace up until the pitstops, but was not able to overtake Button as Button stayed in front. After the front three all pitted at the end of lap 23 Webber emerged with P5 while Raikkonen started sixth. Hamilton also made use of his tyres for the stop by pitting on lap 27, but fell behind Webber and behind Vettel. Hamilton also spun on his out lap, which brought out the red flag. As the race restarted on lap 35 Webber drove past Hamilton to take P4 and he managed the race from there without trouble to claim his first podium of the season. His podium was further aided as Alonso finished less than a second ahead of Perez.","token_len":286,"entropy":[9.6863,0.2203,0.0755,2.2936,0.512,2.7564,8.4222,5.2702,10.0195,4.021,0.8168,2.1959,7.0641,1.0007,5.0064,3.4839,3.0751,3.0263,1.2114,2.6767,4.0493,2.1852,6.1078,13.8105,8.2403,6.8095,4.8011,5.2599,2.9834,4.948,5.8447,0.0561,3.5123,1.7845,1.1624,3.9682,0.0012,8.0693,7.7758,7.7484,10.4879,0.6993,4.8996,2.1068,1.1436,1.8702,1.5979,1.9676,0.4785,0.7249,4.5107,2.0907,6.4852,5.2948,5.0033,7.8161,4.1496,2.4321,4.8206,3.2786,4.4162,3.6405,2.4475,2.3602,3.8065,3.8565,2.7293,4.9273,0.0777,0.9579,0.8277,4.0812,0.4255,2.8669,0.0033,0.3595,3.7837,2.1608,1.2015,0.0778,0.1908,2.1943,5.3562,0.463,5.6779,6.295,0.9411,0.2147,4.2654,5.4547,1.2187,1.1399,3.5887,1.6146,2.4516,4.6219,1.7819,4.4304,1.4954,4.7831,7.0516,0.1149,2.3472,1.5442,5.9459,0.2803,0.0003,4.2058,5.8556,1.6102,0.3356,0.4271,1.4046,6.4885,2.3151,0.0056,1.9397,1.0379,3.2703,1.9197,4.2403,1.4422,2.0521,6.4928,0.5951,1.9077,2.1046,2.4529,5.6756,2.9068,0.7277,8.8971,0.0021,4.9689,3.6296,0.9332,2.4312,0.2268,5.6106,1.9972,3.1495,6.155,3.0177,5.8516,1.8546,4.8735,2.5406,6.0858,5.2107,1.3945,3.9966,3.7544,0.0575,1.0631,1.1293,4.0057,4.0525,1.0684,0.0033,3.9329,6.5504,3.1147,4.2472,6.171,1.5401,2.2489,1.3872,4.022,1.6698,5.9941,4.9627,6.8096,4.6621,3.4253,0.8109,2.9857,0.1855,5.2792,4.278,7.7916,0.0034,6.1353,3.5353,8.4415,4.3876,6.8618,6.6409,0.0,0.0001,4.2629,5.957,0.8267,2.4572,4.5037,3.8476,5.1319,0.003,1.5232,4.9832,3.5901,0.9357,7.6575,6.1986,6.4118,0.6773,3.2657,4.8896,3.7685,1.8389,1.3061,7.1293,1.4812,6.0072,0.0025,2.3972,6.7008,3.016,0.013,1.0171,2.3273,3.8702,5.2345,2.6225,2.7388,7.3587,4.7789,1.7963,3.0652,4.887,4.2852,1.8149,5.1396,1.342,1.4909,4.562,1.8206,2.4335,4.4679,0.2484,4.2323,0.0851,4.0236,1.779,0.0081,4.0247,3.8224,2.2779,1.6547,2.1056,4.7042,2.4734,2.3896,4.1723,4.808,4.3098,4.1129,6.5301,0.8718,5.8508,4.7517,5.0601,3.7335,0.6605,0.8657,2.3161,1.9188,0.3675,0.1348,0.1778,5.2177,5.4483,2.692,5.662,3.9742,6.2185,3.9858,2.448,9.8724,0.1152,2.05,1.7373,2.151,0.1224,5.949,0.8692]}

Raisins and currants were used, which in the English language were referred to as plums, and not the fruit known as plums. Modern British fruitcakes can be made with or without candied fruit, usually raisins or mixed fruit. It is traditionally covered with golden syrup and then sprinkled with mace (nutmeg), sultanas, and currants. The plums typically used are the \"old English\", which are tart, and not the very sweet modern-day British plums and are not commonly used today.\n\nPlum cake has two variations. One is similar to an English plum cake, but the raisins are omitted and it is covered in sugar as well as golden syrup. The other version has golden syrup as the sweetener (often known as the English plum cake). Raising agents such as yeast or bread crumbs are sometimes added for the more moist and dense cake. It can be served as a dessert or as a more robust breakfast cake.\n\nMincemeat pie or mincecake is traditionally made for Christmas or winter time. The use of apples and sultanas is traditional and is similar to how plum cake would be prepared.\n\nPlum cake is the title of a 2010 cookery book by Patricia Wells.\n\nHistorical notes","token_len":286,"entropy":[5.4461,10.9811,5.5035,8.3026,8.5596,0.0207,4.7784,4.8415,5.5489,6.9468,6.4873,0.4596,5.9229,3.646,4.3613,4.6767,5.7051,4.696,3.9474,0.6921,9.0546,2.6727,0.0106,2.1042,5.0402,0.9006,2.2443,2.1744,3.5604,3.9519,4.2143,2.5064,4.7396,3.7771,2.7996,3.1476,0.023,0.1096,6.3019,0.1919,1.8504,2.2224,6.0062,4.6342,4.0765,8.9444,0.332,2.7818,0.1638,1.1471,5.9909,5.117,1.8918,1.0109,4.4538,0.4641,2.2088,0.6965,5.035,0.0093,6.7742,1.207,1.139,1.2408,5.585,6.3397,0.0335,0.0053,1.625,7.8211,1.2366,0.7625,4.2833,0.4021,5.7901,7.4144,0.489,6.4475,4.6133,1.6497,3.8769,3.8255,0.4501,5.9113,1.4968,3.886,8.026,0.5545,2.0164,6.2831,2.382,0.1601,0.8277,1.8217,6.5671,0.1472,0.5666,2.2501,5.3881,0.0481,6.3203,5.2605,1.3277,3.1808,5.2779,5.3904,4.4218,4.4951,2.2469,2.215,7.0099,1.4015,3.5311,4.1978,1.4122,5.4806,3.3201,5.2255,4.8292,0.2841,5.0329,2.8578,0.0155,4.1211,7.0834,3.2318,3.8875,1.2836,1.86,0.2779,1.2035,0.0268,3.7231,0.2091,0.9862,2.6033,7.8116,6.1433,1.2711,2.9914,0.5865,6.149,0.3414,4.0383,2.3059,4.2237,0.69,1.055,1.3359,3.3407,5.2448,0.0528,0.0085,1.0008,5.2622,1.886,4.8307,0.322,3.9124,2.1945,3.6507,5.3188,1.6832,0.9004,6.2177,0.0735,0.3812,0.5549,0.4548,3.4004,3.4407,6.9864,0.2821,4.3504,1.1134,4.7024,0.287,4.1948,4.5929,4.1043,0.0298,3.3639,4.9453,2.3623,1.0959,0.9192,6.1935,5.019,11.2637,1.8469,0.0008,6.2726,2.2342,7.2723,2.5857,0.0059,1.1987,4.7551,1.5596,4.0913,1.4299,6.6691,5.1408,2.5854,5.0443,2.2731,0.4573,3.4702,3.5404,0.5252,4.8714,1.7947,0.3706,2.6574,1.5098,0.9221,0.289,7.2192,7.1762,4.3132,2.5746,0.5127,0.6647,0.0002,4.6843,5.7835,2.2998,5.7029,4.0483,4.0431,0.1351,4.966,1.0956,4.2241,1.5535,4.956,4.5614,1.7872,6.5888,4.3056,1.0251,2.0941,5.4271,0.0149,4.9968,1.527,5.0315,1.2619,0.0063,1.653,7.0188,1.8181,2.0266,5.5802,0.1027,5.1444,7.2881,1.3807,5.3391,0.1721,3.1169,1.1017,1.7743,0.0002,3.3894,0.2687,0.7618,0.9212,3.8184,8.7642,0.8426,0.6813,7.986,3.7331,6.8504,0.7564,0.7943,6.2505,7.1618,1.4618,2.5444,0.0002,7.3117,0.8982,4.5058]}

At present, hardness is the main factor that can decide whether elements can be used as an intermetallic compound, and it will influence the application of these elements. It is important to study the structure of high hardness intermetallic compounds, which can give us reference. The structure of scandium- yttrium- lanthanum - actinium compounds are still unknown. It is important to observe the structure because the mechanism of synthesis play an important role in application.In order to investigate the structure, we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) to image the surface of scandium- yttrium- lanthanum - actinium alloys at different temperatures under a load. As we know, the hardness of Y - Sc 2 L - Ln - As compounds increases as the temperature is lowered. The hardness of Y - Sc 2 L - Ln - As alloys can be adjusted by the composition, which can be controlled in AFM.This study has shown that the hardness of Y - Sc 2 L - Ln - As alloys increases as the temperature is lowered, which confirms the theory that shows the trend that the hardness will increase as the temperature decreases.","token_len":286,"entropy":[10.7967,4.034,6.8586,11.3606,10.5382,6.4771,3.7326,10.2319,7.5707,4.3964,3.9084,9.7309,2.2156,2.5094,13.163,4.6454,0.4616,2.5864,7.704,0.8066,0.0062,0.3529,6.232,0.0746,0.3166,0.3948,7.8997,0.1397,1.7523,4.3032,5.1503,2.4152,5.4202,7.489,2.2806,2.9758,6.5525,1.3894,1.9784,3.8366,0.2084,6.1341,3.4551,5.7493,3.8129,0.2683,10.8033,1.1068,2.8644,3.8333,3.6573,2.4844,4.2308,6.9482,1.5899,7.2481,2.2065,0.5931,2.1843,1.4046,3.2457,7.0655,4.292,0.0593,3.196,2.1984,2.1762,2.9415,4.8769,7.3221,0.961,5.6772,0.1045,2.6966,0.9276,1.8643,3.5688,0.586,2.4029,0.2024,6.1266,0.634,3.9992,0.4342,5.6301,5.1948,4.7394,0.0952,0.2996,0.766,1.5566,2.9571,2.3201,4.6441,2.6924,9.2536,5.7434,2.3796,3.7349,0.1524,7.3273,0.0039,0.005,3.3523,5.8339,0.2019,0.0068,0.5958,2.1936,0.0026,0.0978,6.6579,6.5131,0.0231,0.0027,4.6761,3.4058,6.4559,2.8968,1.191,2.7817,0.5379,2.8834,0.112,4.3457,1.1585,2.8477,7.9682,2.3129,6.1676,1.1312,3.879,10.4571,1.5383,0.0507,0.1243,0.3029,8.242,1.6202,8.717,2.5648,0.0363,3.8824,0.3578,2.0661,3.4379,1.188,3.4821,5.3389,4.8465,1.0018,0.0077,1.3806,0.8189,0.1129,0.403,1.0621,4.9524,0.756,3.7737,0.3774,3.8322,0.0027,0.0044,0.7605,0.338,0.0055,0.0018,0.4279,0.0325,0.0003,0.002,1.9595,0.0986,0.0012,0.0007,8.6206,0.2108,4.5675,2.4749,2.7099,5.0256,3.4499,7.1671,1.524,4.1221,2.9516,4.0238,1.2181,1.5764,5.7951,0.3239,9.7573,6.0733,11.901,10.511,6.8383,3.2062,5.7393,5.0922,2.9547,7.2738,8.7116,4.1048,2.8088,1.1172,1.9889,3.405,2.2051,1.3384,1.8153,4.2215,0.4191,1.885,0.3945,0.2447,0.1066,0.242,0.3944,0.2087,0.0322,0.1707,0.1344,5.8091,0.0116,4.2887,0.4463,5.645,1.7604,2.2325,5.9659,3.4859,2.8537,1.9913,0.7842,4.3115,3.101,4.7346,0.0089,1.4055,5.7249,1.9563,3.2319,2.0636,0.3136,1.5194,2.6165,0.2,1.428,0.1895,0.0513,0.03,0.0282,0.1504,0.0776,0.0212,0.1011,0.0698,1.9672,0.0016,3.2277,0.9569,0.2305,0.5679,0.2607,0.2513,1.6272,2.7016,5.6806,0.8916,3.611,0.7092,10.5575,1.947,9.0347,3.7285,2.2611,2.0171,5.9429,0.9455,1.1574,0.2131,0.4551,2.2485,0.1684]}
{"id":3130,"ended":true,"length":232,"text":"A number of non @ - @ native, invasive species have been identified as a threat to native biodiversity, including Giant Hogweed, Japanese Knotweed and Rhododendron. In May 2008 it was announced that Pectinatrix japonica (Benth) was established in the UK, and that the National Plant Collection (now at WES) in Lye, Essex, is an appropriate place to collect any seed that develops locally.\n\nIn the UK the species grows from Norfolk to the Shetlands, and in Scotland from Orkney and Shetland north into Moray, Banff and Caithness. P. japonica is said to be a problem only where it is left by the wind, but the seeds have often been observed blown and deposited by the wind as on sea cliffs to the west of Scarborough. A specimen has been deposited with the National Plant Collection.\n\nIn a typical season the seeds germinate in July and August and mature in the autumn (P.L. Gage, pers. comm., 2006).

Please see the following document for a complete breakdown of the work required by the contractor:\n\nPhase 2 Project Document\n\nWork on the new waterway will involve removing the existing weir on the River Welland at Donington Bridge, and lowering the weir at Crowland. The existing channel will be filled and the new channel constructed upstream of Crowland. The contractor will be required to install a number of temporary structures to support the removal of the existing weir and dredging. Once work has been completed to the satisfaction of Lincolnshire County Council, work has been programmed to commence on the permanent weir at Crowland. This work will involve the weir being demolished and rebuilt. A further report is due to be submitted in May, 2018.\n\nIn the event that the full amount of funds for the Phase 2 project has not been made available by 1 July, or if additional funding becomes available, work will continue to be completed where necessary on a phased basis.\n\nFor further enquiries please contact Mike Caudwell, Senior Waterways Manager on 01522 581230.","token_len":286,"entropy":[5.5134,3.0739,1.2669,6.2724,8.9546,8.9481,3.9479,3.7122,5.3311,2.2571,9.1281,0.3919,8.1551,5.1933,4.6566,0.3735,9.582,4.4463,3.8343,8.1235,11.388,8.3436,7.6985,2.2659,1.8939,2.316,3.396,1.6672,0.7263,4.7889,6.8579,7.9717,4.177,7.2684,4.0012,0.0048,1.4688,3.9988,2.8395,0.0713,3.4227,1.19,11.1002,6.8846,2.0318,0.8384,1.3156,6.2938,0.4867,3.2895,1.202,1.0672,0.3257,3.6189,1.0484,7.0687,2.4731,2.2568,3.5299,6.5997,2.6922,3.0694,2.8347,0.3593,5.9126,1.4751,0.8501,3.2631,4.4666,0.6327,2.6961,1.405,3.4511,0.1281,0.5113,2.3662,2.9105,3.2528,0.6117,1.1217,1.2912,1.3004,0.0015,5.9974,0.7281,5.3794,7.6988,1.5079,0.0003,5.4567,3.4154,0.4666,5.2172,3.1772,0.0305,2.4601,4.602,5.7031,1.3732,1.8887,9.9312,3.2709,4.1333,0.5683,3.3749,0.2517,0.093,3.9445,2.3941,0.0154,0.3393,1.6086,2.1108,7.7649,0.6439,2.5156,0.0112,2.5992,0.5014,0.0042,1.0007,1.115,4.1455,7.4054,1.7309,0.7926,4.7096,3.7914,1.6608,1.629,1.5957,5.386,7.777,1.4791,3.2193,0.0013,0.8389,1.1274,4.8483,0.7145,2.7103,1.3178,0.0238,3.3038,1.3852,5.3554,0.0018,3.7678,4.2066,1.531,2.3421,0.2602,4.5577,0.1515,0.2906,1.2224,1.2703,0.0033,1.7882,7.1134,0.7312,1.7677,5.0248,6.0667,2.1026,0.6136,0.1106,4.4213,1.8345,10.5204,0.008,11.4855,4.1081,2.8581,1.7183,0.3226,4.2073,6.0105,1.0217,9.5824,0.4559,2.3812,1.0195,0.398,7.7868,2.5437,0.0267,1.2864,0.4776,0.0041,0.9635,3.1048,1.4074,0.5767,2.8357,1.7263,5.8973,0.1177,2.0108,5.9066,1.1054,5.2845,2.244,3.7641,5.1868,7.0133,2.1403,1.5625,1.34,0.4225,1.9336,2.658,3.1831,4.0821,0.8152,0.4397,0.6217,0.0002,3.8638,2.0754,1.1412,0.8134,1.1974,7.183,4.4723,0.2618,3.3329,2.4404,0.4007,5.5514,0.106,0.6818,3.2297,0.28,0.2753,4.6024,0.0102,2.1133,1.5054,0.1805,0.3558,5.8687,1.1937,4.0562,1.9119,6.2427,0.0337,0.9791,2.613,0.5972,2.4045,1.663,0.329,2.9932,7.0472,1.4304,4.1873,3.7058,6.843,1.9032,1.019,1.2348,0.0002,3.9848,1.5103,6.4743,0.0127,1.7334,0.298,6.3766,4.9732,5.8193,2.0893,1.1665,4.056,4.9268,2.9159,1.8706,5.1567,1.3961,6.3907,5.933,4.5683,5.324,1.4781]}

The Latin word Th\u00f3c\u00f3s means \"writing table\" (Th\u00f3cum).","token_len":286,"entropy":[10.4727,0.2437,6.4067,2.1319,6.5779,5.6381,0.0524,4.8486,2.1149,7.5044,1.1708,11.2748,1.2818,0.3353,2.4593,1.9265,8.7411,6.1714,12.5683,0.1421,1.3835,1.1974,10.5262,1.7253,0.67,4.497,3.6183,1.6711,2.8147,6.5604,2.263,6.6643,2.3125,4.5135,1.8742,4.969,2.9279,4.3666,0.3058,0.032,0.2093,2.0069,0.0059,2.1385,4.7681,4.1574,7.7956,1.5982,0.0601,1.2117,0.9341,2.7472,5.5018,7.1664,8.6052,5.7553,3.5411,2.9918,5.1359,0.2046,0.1464,5.0212,0.3696,6.0742,2.6381,2.2949,5.0325,1.1239,4.5714,2.5788,1.5369,2.3103,6.31,4.7321,1.3146,1.0518,2.2812,2.9864,1.6447,6.4942,1.8068,2.1424,2.8926,3.3732,7.4365,0.007,1.1673,7.8901,3.4831,1.4249,1.3938,1.5509,2.1165,1.4815,1.7316,6.3664,0.0299,0.2304,0.0034,0.0081,5.9938,0.1194,0.9088,6.4432,2.0949,7.8638,0.119,1.0939,1.5559,7.9767,0.6939,2.3537,6.2313,2.9492,0.1497,9.0444,4.7007,6.8609,9.4819,1.0065,3.1317,7.3996,2.2715,7.148,4.8957,4.7083,1.1748,0.0002,4.5201,0.606,2.7143,6.6887,5.2304,6.189,6.716,0.9459,2.6829,3.4399,2.5818,3.9965,3.9156,3.4754,7.2165,2.6549,9.8433,7.8194,2.6386,5.547,5.9311,2.1572,5.8875,6.2863,0.3128,4.531,1.1021,9.287,0.7627,4.9363,0.0362,1.4403,1.1193,0.0003,1.9107,4.7454,1.5525,5.1121,6.1393,5.0244,2.4639,4.7095,0.6199,1.4476,2.5015,0.2746,6.1407,8.3803,1.2602,2.5465,6.0412,2.0696,7.3526,5.0316,4.6446,6.0985,2.0471,7.5594,0.5386,3.0718,4.1645,5.2421,0.5821,1.023,2.5446,2.2122,6.7769,0.4516,0.0246,1.645,1.5864,3.9304,0.3848,1.1674,3.4715,3.0194,5.9447,2.8741,1.4319,4.7994,4.3721,5.9013,3.043,0.2709,0.9934,0.1107,4.8813,0.0025,0.488,2.7396,2.5232,0.439,1.3919,0.0002,1.5645,5.156,0.9972,4.1344,1.193,0.0657,2.7935,2.1269,2.0092,1.6196,1.653,1.121,5.1886,2.6245,1.786,8.5349,4.1623,1.41,5.0551,3.4176,5.0552,1.0681,0.0203,6.5668,3.9254,0.3299,5.605,4.6541,1.9247,3.7461,1.3003,1.8659,1.5806,5.2976,7.8849,4.4473,0.4219,2.0431,3.1507,5.3584,1.6279,0.4547,6.5441,0.4734,1.1693,2.016,5.2852,1.199,3.4274,5.1577,5.5636,3.0627,3.2144,3.7395,0.2879,9.6794,7.8892,1.0967,1.8742,3.7956,1.8803,7.6936,2.6728]}
{"id":2937,"ended":true,"length":255,"text":"In his Planetary Hypotheses, Ptolemy ( < unk > \u2013 168 ) rejected the Aristotelian concept of an external prime mover, maintaining instead that the planets have souls and move themselves with a force that Ptolemy labeled \"natural motion.\" This force, Ptolemy reasoned, is generated by the sun and is a principle that causes their motions. The planets, in turn, influence the stars (which are moving in spheres around them) and thereby cause the movements we see in the heavens.\n\nPtolemy was the first to observe the elliptical orbits of the planets, but because the movements of the planets are relatively small compared to the distance between two points on the surface of the sun (i.e., the orbits are very close in), it was assumed that they only moved very gradually. To account for their rapid movement in his theoretical models, Ptolemy assumed that their inertia caused the moon to move in the same way as the planets and that the sun is the only large body in the solar system. In turn, the planets all exert their effects through the moon. Because the sun rotates, the gravitational potentials caused by the planets and moon constantly change, and this causes the planets to slowly rotate and swing around the sun.\n\nPtolemy's models were the first systematic efforts to attempt to describe cosmic phenomena using models of forces.","token_len":287,"entropy":[5.6528,15.18,9.4424,1.3222,0.0025,1.4537,5.9268,5.0875,0.0014,0.1415,4.2198,13.4454,9.5049,5.019,4.09,7.0692,10.6195,2.068,7.0917,0.5935,6.6984,0.0219,0.0007,0.0059,4.7877,0.1303,3.0867,5.4032,9.9852,5.4223,1.4405,1.4947,7.2453,3.5434,0.3112,1.4042,5.9406,3.4257,8.1247,2.0054,6.723,6.4586,3.9217,3.1017,3.5405,1.6943,8.8185,0.0032,0.0008,0.0086,6.1163,1.06,5.2536,4.7236,0.726,3.0481,5.1674,1.8801,1.7316,0.0026,0.0014,0.0025,4.6005,0.0325,1.3532,5.4187,0.4606,1.0311,4.2362,1.6657,2.2523,3.8107,6.1681,2.5659,4.5754,5.334,3.1109,0.9238,2.343,3.4929,2.3665,2.7741,1.3134,0.0019,7.7127,1.0659,3.9414,3.7909,3.7727,1.7803,5.6975,1.4062,7.6911,3.5644,0.7352,0.871,1.0462,6.2561,3.4461,1.3326,5.7806,6.3184,0.5235,1.2139,1.0987,3.3361,0.5296,1.3056,0.0145,2.072,0.06,0.0024,0.0031,2.9504,3.3575,0.5742,0.2665,5.7326,1.4805,9.3512,0.0654,1.6763,0.2426,0.9687,0.6671,1.3679,3.3531,6.1531,1.9804,5.6107,0.4922,0.4614,0.6514,1.1896,4.8336,2.527,2.5844,0.2164,0.8366,5.7222,0.8673,5.4278,2.2735,1.1766,0.6076,3.859,0.4175,0.2513,1.2763,2.5905,3.6,0.0008,0.0005,0.1342,1.6739,3.5033,2.373,3.5701,2.0232,3.3001,11.8035,2.3973,1.143,4.5244,0.1404,2.2805,6.1333,3.7663,4.8479,4.8267,1.2176,4.0881,4.3831,0.0084,3.1267,3.9356,1.8508,3.7755,5.645,6.422,2.8799,0.2898,0.4317,0.001,0.0004,0.0046,4.0917,0.237,2.7858,7.0191,3.5432,1.4919,7.4483,0.4089,1.4158,1.9685,1.7726,1.1057,0.9514,1.1037,0.7894,2.7926,3.8255,0.5214,1.3593,3.4617,3.8498,2.3247,1.8422,7.2786,2.6191,1.0013,0.1881,0.9311,0.0067,2.0472,2.771,5.5002,0.0244,2.5091,2.8613,6.7065,7.4686,1.8915,6.774,3.8422,1.4948,5.3921,2.0024,5.0698,1.0713,3.4567,5.2178,0.0012,2.8309,1.1041,5.0824,4.3834,2.9255,6.5443,0.0773,0.4574,2.4193,3.2475,2.2781,7.5806,2.0403,1.2048,1.7905,3.6035,3.9385,0.9168,2.2207,0.1948,5.1946,2.8402,2.6893,6.4502,1.6338,1.2592,0.5503,0.9138,1.1283,0.0002,1.9499,0.0068,0.001,0.0068,1.1327,3.8188,1.5934,4.717,1.295,8.2332,5.5112,0.1189,6.1483,0.1878,4.0006,8.3062,2.1592,2.9834,5.2253,0.6339,6.7059,2.0498]}

The United States would maintain only a diplomatic mission in Hanoi and Phnom Penh.\n\nGeneral William Westmoreland, Commanding General of US forces in Vietnam, reported that the United States was withdrawing all forces in Vietnam by early May.","token_len":287,"entropy":[8.086,2.5863,2.8172,11.4854,5.4934,2.1398,13.78,4.1666,3.563,11.9271,10.6341,1.4638,8.9125,6.4248,8.7065,0.4269,9.2183,2.0781,9.0085,4.9016,0.4265,4.3397,3.0785,9.7621,3.7178,5.4154,2.6803,12.5189,0.5018,0.2946,2.4671,0.0181,3.5079,9.6469,1.2228,2.9353,6.149,3.1835,3.7863,4.623,0.0139,1.3988,6.1403,0.1425,1.6388,0.6706,3.9352,4.2798,8.3139,0.0179,1.366,2.4794,0.0526,2.2687,6.5982,0.081,4.5589,1.3704,4.8304,3.737,1.7427,1.7716,3.5137,0.0045,3.334,1.795,4.3804,1.4723,4.7374,2.6777,0.3624,3.1855,6.7473,0.0193,3.1369,0.1933,0.0031,4.7305,5.2186,0.1464,0.0497,1.2732,0.7969,2.1729,0.4149,1.4497,0.0025,5.5787,0.9116,4.2892,4.7175,0.4017,1.9377,0.0002,1.7236,3.5558,0.0472,5.208,4.3008,2.8569,4.0976,10.2657,0.228,0.3278,0.8467,6.0649,5.7726,0.5112,0.3517,6.9347,0.0394,0.8252,5.0677,1.4802,3.1354,3.3709,3.4255,0.9581,1.0438,6.9263,0.4651,3.5843,1.9299,0.0378,2.4144,1.1116,6.9356,0.0234,0.0158,9.4156,4.6648,1.1388,1.3934,0.1889,3.4986,4.4497,6.6786,0.9816,2.7809,2.6653,0.8823,4.5324,5.7873,15.4641,7.7845,4.2226,0.9037,0.8283,4.3213,0.0004,0.93,4.0023,1.0526,7.3351,0.0041,1.3047,3.8227,0.5517,0.9137,2.3162,0.0051,0.0026,3.8978,0.127,7.8224,2.4946,1.2299,3.554,2.879,6.2833,0.9927,3.1808,5.6313,1.6709,1.3493,2.3721,0.0042,0.0019,3.0134,1.1447,0.073,5.9074,1.1305,6.7018,0.3615,4.7229,3.5052,0.641,1.6214,1.7176,0.0001,5.5306,0.3796,4.4612,3.4632,0.8006,0.8062,2.2333,0.0384,2.1357,1.2438,2.7531,3.5916,2.0108,2.573,0.2869,0.8971,3.8973,1.4898,0.2315,0.0006,8.2049,1.0054,2.4805,5.7777,0.5864,2.68,2.1562,0.633,0.1449,4.0647,3.0316,4.5505,1.8407,3.1989,1.4449,4.9608,3.8636,5.2585,1.0134,3.0829,2.0042,0.0193,2.4228,0.8614,1.489,2.2312,0.056,2.9837,4.6024,5.9711,1.9761,8.4589,3.7827,0.655,5.919,0.0003,0.0012,1.668,7.68,0.06,0.0004,0.0002,0.8954,1.205,0.0002,5.3951,4.9614,3.9612,0.8979,0.0198,1.0826,4.9793,0.3535,0.6666,0.274,4.1519,2.8951,0.4426,0.7316,0.3943,4.2675,1.0657,1.1127,1.559,0.0084,1.6177,1.4508,2.1327,4.2843,2.0168,1.0012,1.8034,5.9464,2.3701,0.6785]}

There isn't one place where you have to change clothes to enter the plane : the first class has a separate entrance at a separate floor, with separate seating area away from the first class. You also get a choice of restaurants on the plane ( and that is in addition to the regular menu served ) and the food is so good that everyone I've ever known to have flown @ with this airline gets hungry for a visit home after only a few hours.

{"id":1951,"ended":true,"length":256,"text":"Over twenty skulls have been found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, elaborate bony crest atop its skull, which contained the elongate narial passages. The head crest was usually much enlarged, as it enlarged in a fashion similar to that of modern species of birds. It usually grew much larger than the animal itself, covering much of the skull and leaving only the beak opening exposed to the outside world. One skull had lost the beak entirely, with the rest of the skull covered by the enlarged, elaborately branched crest. The bony crest was composed and shaped of alternating bony and cartilaginous growths. The crest also contained large pits and holes, which may have served as feeding sites.The neck and body of the specimen have been virtually completely worn down by scavengers, making it difficult to distinguish its skeleton from that of the adult Triceratops. However, numerous fragments of bone have been found in the field. They indicate that the body was very thick and robust, making it a very formidable predator. The femur also shows evidence of wear that could have been caused by a fierce struggle against or escape from prey.The first skull and cervical vertebrae were discovered in 1884 by Charles Marsh near Lonetree, which is just over. The next skull was found in 1890 in Big Sky, Yellowstone County, less than.","token_len":288,"entropy":[9.927,12.6766,3.3854,0.1816,1.2276,4.7886,3.179,7.6808,1.6262,5.5914,3.146,2.6799,11.7286,4.9613,4.6896,2.9084,5.9621,0.2712,1.5189,5.2495,8.3325,1.3653,7.8209,1.0967,8.5441,5.8447,0.1211,3.4384,5.9589,0.6776,3.6877,1.6438,1.8975,5.6071,2.2486,6.9545,2.4297,10.8743,5.9274,10.193,1.4819,1.4378,4.2941,5.1864,1.1021,5.7981,5.9233,6.9261,1.0281,3.1394,1.9975,7.4609,2.9008,3.7267,5.2891,0.8301,0.0067,1.4214,0.3646,4.6849,6.6326,1.2371,6.0312,0.6276,2.9771,5.9168,5.1324,4.7624,0.5405,0.8319,1.2411,4.1407,3.671,0.6069,6.6681,3.574,0.1926,1.0849,3.5714,1.8704,4.8292,2.3338,1.3669,6.8851,0.0834,7.7087,8.6429,1.9572,0.7118,4.0702,0.6854,0.1966,5.529,3.5028,3.399,7.6032,2.5654,2.4341,0.0264,5.1284,0.6978,3.9211,1.5657,1.4471,1.4402,0.3852,1.4406,3.0873,1.6558,2.2396,6.8012,3.2173,7.0727,0.0114,6.503,0.2832,0.0,2.5861,0.3445,1.4388,4.829,0.0127,1.1268,1.3976,5.354,7.6433,3.9642,3.5211,6.3365,4.974,0.0454,1.9602,7.934,0.2241,0.0079,0.0094,5.6916,0.3694,1.1122,1.0906,3.235,3.1879,1.9399,4.2152,6.1211,2.2399,3.9889,1.4805,1.6792,4.1821,0.2039,4.2452,0.4228,5.4839,3.5027,1.3609,6.9629,6.1925,2.1751,4.0631,0.9525,0.8457,4.3714,5.1051,0.5415,8.6007,2.4937,8.1564,1.9235,2.6382,7.1004,0.8945,1.1844,4.8131,0.7954,1.1057,0.2281,2.6407,2.4137,5.8039,0.2671,1.6681,0.0841,2.0767,5.8212,9.4228,0.4649,0.0026,0.0002,0.7373,3.4117,0.0127,6.419,3.6545,0.2616,2.7176,1.5095,0.2038,0.4049,1.8622,0.6247,6.244,1.8022,5.0996,4.0062,0.2777,0.771,3.6686,0.9041,4.3115,5.172,1.1226,3.9329,0.7201,5.0246,0.4011,2.3611,1.7068,3.6617,1.353,0.4306,1.5265,6.0041,0.0782,4.6887,2.6451,3.2927,0.0843,4.7582,3.6892,2.4227,1.1361,0.6726,0.7384,0.0723,3.2686,7.5346,4.2415,3.9206,6.9172,6.4082,0.5568,3.3674,0.3692,2.6695,5.7529,3.5298,4.9461,8.1518,0.3559,0.0094,0.2925,1.6499,2.3944,0.8146,3.643,4.0694,1.5333,4.2845,8.3069,6.5477,5.0287,10.1054,0.3244,0.3765,5.4028,2.087,3.6773,3.3094,7.7801,1.3975,4.779,3.157,0.9481,1.3201,0.46,3.581,1.9997,8.6598,7.0014,1.1035,9.6098,4.6969,0.4463,6.5004,0.0038,9.3095]}

Excavations conducted by the Staffordshire Archaeological Unit, however, yielded no evidence that the remains present were of more than four individuals, and this is a fact that was also emphasized by the British Museum.\n\nIn spite of the absence of skeletal remains, an iron bar, a fragment of a copper axe, and a polished piece of antler were recorded from the cemetery, and Ashbee hypothesized that these could have held significance because they could be evidence of personal status symbols. In particular he felt that the copper axe could have had religious significance, since it could have been made as a votive offering.\n\nThe tomb was opened as part of a larger excavation of the Coldrum estate and its environs undertaken in 1985, but a thorough search of the site failed to produce any more further artifacts or evidence.\n\nIt is not known when or under what circumstances the tomb was built, although it has traditionally been believed that the location was given by the Anglo-Saxons who settled at or near Coldrum after the Anglo-Saxon Conquest in the late sixth century. The cemetery itself could have been created in the early seventh century, during the reign of Oswyrd as King of Mercia (633\u2014668).","token_len":288,"entropy":[10.0101,7.8597,1.0624,7.5584,4.2741,3.4645,1.0067,13.5846,1.448,1.657,6.8046,9.3863,1.4911,0.4598,3.9478,0.0305,6.7568,2.6799,6.5637,1.6591,7.8845,0.7653,2.3475,9.2717,9.7151,11.495,2.4076,2.4866,3.7853,3.0767,1.5229,0.0872,5.7948,2.6576,1.7842,3.0711,0.6071,9.549,0.0359,0.3771,4.3863,1.2462,1.4654,8.4091,0.0892,2.0177,0.1066,4.5904,3.0268,3.1491,0.0043,4.9262,1.4131,0.942,1.6962,1.187,2.4771,9.6634,1.7449,1.7774,5.694,0.1122,4.5523,1.051,2.0538,1.6898,4.0747,2.6598,2.8595,4.1657,0.804,2.6548,4.3215,5.7384,0.5668,1.4309,5.8071,0.4231,1.479,0.7287,0.0056,3.0207,4.7397,0.0071,0.8782,4.2663,0.0039,5.2935,0.4033,0.7946,5.0701,6.0019,2.5164,5.1532,3.0581,5.8436,0.1193,1.0067,5.6585,6.0825,0.5852,0.6276,1.1236,7.4921,3.8791,0.0158,8.0328,0.681,2.2662,7.0554,2.6585,0.5064,5.0141,2.3489,2.2926,8.776,0.1327,5.2359,0.1004,2.5825,3.2346,0.7139,4.597,7.9771,4.7613,1.1017,2.3822,2.4566,4.0313,0.3839,6.6474,7.0776,9.0238,1.1626,3.1009,4.0203,6.0695,5.6682,0.2614,1.0179,4.0539,0.5424,2.6593,1.2403,4.0818,6.4853,0.3052,1.4111,2.2925,0.8612,1.9999,0.7776,0.8716,6.0649,4.6141,0.3699,5.9542,0.0007,1.2501,1.9942,1.3282,0.0002,1.9649,4.5838,1.6857,5.0088,4.895,1.4442,0.001,1.1279,3.7258,2.2369,1.9649,0.518,5.7883,0.0971,6.4047,3.5212,3.5584,6.7396,0.0062,0.0009,7.6369,1.3677,6.0643,1.7723,2.8315,3.8378,5.9562,2.5539,1.0234,0.2765,1.5513,2.5174,0.0637,3.6318,0.3342,4.6648,8.3762,3.821,2.902,1.937,1.2247,2.2331,0.0002,4.7113,0.7517,2.9548,0.7324,3.3549,2.2743,5.589,0.1801,0.4495,1.0365,2.7031,0.3131,3.6812,0.8973,3.1348,1.77,2.7122,5.7428,0.1657,3.519,0.2694,1.3391,5.1184,1.3737,5.5269,3.6845,1.362,4.4901,0.2361,0.1277,1.168,3.9836,3.2084,2.9199,7.0063,0.4015,3.46,0.0367,4.1386,0.4024,3.1356,0.0226,0.4559,0.7941,2.0975,1.8852,1.0479,3.1617,4.0943,0.614,1.2525,1.9417,5.2466,2.6216,4.5039,0.8956,0.4806,5.6773,2.0705,0.7558,2.268,2.5019,0.0799,1.6163,4.3321,0.2717,1.1604,0.1061,8.7339,9.0907,5.3564,4.1859,2.7952,1.2732,7.4765,0.0278,3.1139,4.0851,4.6929,7.8331,5.2158,1.5539]}

The idea of the player being unarmed and having to avoid being seen by enemies is one that became the standard for many action games, including the much-beloved Metal Gear Solid series.\n\nBut while the majority of Metal Gear Solid games involve the player taking on the identity of \"Big Boss,\" Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes serves as the prologue to the fifth main entry in Metal Gear Solid. This means that the title contains a significant amount of stealth-oriented gameplay, but also that it contains significant portions of first-person shooter gameplay as well.\n\nFor this reason, it had long been suggested that Ground Zeroes could also be ported to the PlayStation Vita as a kind of expanded version of the game. A new listing on the Sony Europe PlayStation Store seems to confirm that the game is indeed going to be available on the Vita.\n\n\"The definitive stealth experience and prologue to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, featuring more than 100 hours of full single player gameplay, Ground Zeroes lets players discover all the main features of the game.\"\n\nSony did not give a firm release date for the Vita version of Ground Zeroes, but it will be released sometime between May 2014, and September 2014. It is certainly worth noting that the PlayStation TV is also expected to receive the title.","token_len":288,"entropy":[9.4415,0.2188,6.2978,6.5429,7.08,0.6263,0.6203,0.0119,0.0837,7.0613,3.9086,8.2699,0.1994,7.0124,2.5087,0.5999,5.2348,1.8161,0.8489,0.6651,2.1713,6.4211,1.5352,2.8072,6.1338,2.1363,8.8899,1.5773,3.8724,0.9516,4.4787,2.4654,4.0672,1.5379,2.1896,1.6149,2.4166,1.5222,5.5117,3.5467,3.2895,1.5774,1.4876,4.984,0.8083,2.0004,2.874,1.9585,5.7979,1.1158,3.9853,0.0275,2.8018,0.0011,0.1478,4.2403,0.367,1.2602,0.0006,4.889,3.3741,1.3565,5.128,0.0108,2.7574,0.0006,0.1339,1.1519,4.5261,2.2108,0.3446,3.2595,1.2772,1.7072,7.4917,0.2441,5.4613,6.2207,0.2755,1.0478,4.1665,0.0006,0.0181,3.4013,1.7667,3.2257,0.0013,0.0001,6.7373,0.5962,1.7052,7.7275,0.0,0.4045,0.6543,5.9703,5.5708,4.5867,0.1733,2.8957,0.0003,0.0124,3.0138,2.9912,4.6582,0.3304,1.3761,5.2043,4.7591,1.705,3.9247,0.5917,0.006,4.878,3.9349,1.7204,0.7776,1.4485,2.7559,1.8623,4.9432,1.7913,3.486,4.4042,4.2725,0.1361,6.4418,0.3367,0.0141,3.4223,0.5289,3.2953,0.0361,0.238,0.7973,0.0002,4.2989,2.6608,0.5411,0.0815,1.7911,7.183,4.768,0.0946,4.0162,0.1682,2.414,0.002,0.0018,2.6117,3.8476,0.472,7.8904,0.4128,1.6253,1.3928,1.9136,2.6441,1.1053,5.297,0.0008,7.365,1.0296,0.0473,1.155,1.2767,0.9902,4.4659,4.0065,9.5803,1.2982,0.8565,4.4066,6.5429,5.2,0.7171,5.7434,0.0407,1.7656,0.781,1.7851,1.2276,1.2742,1.5337,3.9084,0.0974,0.4232,3.292,1.1312,0.6464,1.5064,1.1555,0.574,0.0001,3.7212,2.1258,7.3032,7.3354,4.4149,5.1341,8.2161,0.0,1.1386,1.6216,0.0015,0.0099,4.1404,1.0706,1.1597,0.0009,0.0006,2.4184,5.0102,4.7919,0.858,2.5766,2.1756,0.0758,5.2691,6.8941,0.7449,2.3916,1.18,5.556,0.0026,0.0006,6.9318,1.2823,4.7305,4.7754,1.0334,6.2848,3.8392,0.2729,0.7995,1.5225,4.8913,0.3933,0.0002,5.7957,5.0693,0.6343,3.6564,1.2503,5.1987,2.176,0.0302,0.3612,0.9379,4.0902,0.4589,0.5213,0.3178,0.0072,0.0011,0.4483,0.3799,1.6772,3.5534,0.7012,1.9422,2.1378,3.053,2.8722,4.3244,4.2096,1.4213,3.216,1.4975,0.4853,2.8527,1.4396,5.1436,3.1692,0.6869,0.0977,1.1632,2.8644,6.8056,3.6244,2.4983,2.458,0.0166,4.6947,1.1348,2.9387,2.0526]}

Colonel Whipple, being a trained soldier, did not recognize the danger ahead. The expedition entered the camp and proceeded to encroach on the lands, claiming the whole area.\n\nThe Mohave, fearing the attack, rose in arms and opened fire, resulting in the death of 13 soldiers and 7 soldiers who later died from disease.\n\nThe soldiers had fired in self-defense, but claimed as much to Governor Marmaduke Boggs, who at first was unaware of the scale of the attack. Only a few days after the attack, Boggs ordered that soldiers be sent to stop the Mohave and their activities, but due to shortage of food and supplies, they were forced to stand down.\n\nThe Mohave were forced to flee, and many took refuge in the mountains of northwestern Nevada and Arizona. They were eventually rounded up and the land was purchased by the Boggs family. It is estimated that 200 Mohave people died as a result of the confrontation.","token_len":288,"entropy":[8.2658,3.5233,0.3413,4.908,3.8931,0.1768,10.4762,6.206,7.889,2.1772,8.2235,16.1958,1.2351,3.3574,3.6841,9.0849,4.1034,4.4621,7.7337,2.9388,5.5617,3.4424,0.0064,8.4224,1.0833,10.925,8.3626,9.3655,3.3026,0.5103,4.7004,1.629,3.8958,0.03,6.896,3.8662,1.5135,5.0931,3.5774,5.8351,3.436,0.8914,10.1262,11.0788,1.0347,0.4094,1.3505,6.3584,6.0955,5.1402,1.6229,3.0043,0.0081,4.0066,3.6031,2.7407,4.912,6.1783,4.338,5.4416,2.6046,3.8986,5.514,0.0011,1.0552,1.1279,1.5035,5.4901,3.4772,2.8148,2.2912,5.1252,5.3456,0.8927,2.4812,2.5951,4.1968,1.3729,2.2727,4.4651,0.0018,0.278,1.4505,0.0525,2.8034,1.5022,5.861,0.0274,0.0003,2.6579,4.4819,2.4554,6.2315,2.6329,0.4447,5.43,0.2214,4.2819,0.7052,8.3057,6.8662,1.7864,2.5825,1.675,5.3786,0.7137,2.3352,1.6061,4.7146,0.969,6.1951,3.0249,1.2759,0.4518,5.1542,3.3558,6.38,1.8662,6.2935,2.6342,1.339,2.0114,0.0001,1.6725,1.855,0.0753,3.9479,5.1199,1.8413,2.8023,0.7947,7.7921,2.9015,2.7432,0.8078,6.1805,0.1332,2.1708,5.7459,0.0049,0.9389,1.6092,0.0505,6.5842,4.3258,1.2251,6.5019,4.627,3.7785,6.9817,0.8242,3.0274,6.3641,0.4803,1.469,0.0002,1.5308,5.273,3.3168,7.266,4.0775,2.519,0.1073,0.0763,1.0475,1.0089,9.2396,6.2943,2.5302,3.3956,11.2511,7.3609,8.164,0.0315,5.0792,4.4503,0.6361,1.762,0.8603,4.8378,3.361,4.0387,4.4689,0.3734,0.3666,7.6067,0.0593,0.1025,0.9056,0.4813,7.0019,2.3065,0.4762,2.0021,1.9332,0.5307,0.8927,0.9962,3.6939,0.0015,0.0028,2.258,3.0542,5.0767,1.2959,2.1996,0.5832,7.8217,1.1259,4.0016,0.0273,2.6709,3.9285,6.8156,2.2002,1.5743,6.7245,0.0051,8.4734,0.0882,2.446,0.8614,1.8532,0.8369,2.641,0.9862,2.3674,0.0539,5.4713,2.0677,0.6776,0.7752,0.0002,1.7309,2.0527,0.0108,2.6319,3.0989,0.1286,2.6267,2.4278,1.3626,4.4786,5.3554,0.7135,0.4076,1.1516,2.8671,2.8189,5.9745,5.5883,3.2656,3.9701,0.4343,3.0552,1.4937,2.4392,4.9381,0.0326,0.8956,5.4131,5.8299,1.7105,5.0573,0.7326,0.9265,4.9002,0.0682,0.0186,2.3132,1.0475,4.4643,1.4199,2.09,0.1608,5.7617,2.1329,0.0181,2.9157,2.2408,3.1926,0.0991,0.0431,0.0802,0.326,8.0882,0.5662]}

{"id":2126,"ended":true,"length":249,"text":"Increasing economic success allowed Busch to visit Wiedensahl more frequently. Busch had decided to leave Munich, as only few relatives lived there, and the artists'association was temporarily disbanded. In May 1894, the artists' association was permanently disbanded. During the three months in 1894, Busch spent considerable time on the estate of Wiedensahl, including, painting, sketching and walking. Busch did not leave Wiedensahl until the end of October 1894. His paintings from this time, however, did nothing to reflect his time spent at Wiedensahl, but rather to reflect the new German romantic art.\n\nIn January 1895, two years after he left Munich Busch travelled to Berlin. He made contact with the Bauhaus and was inspired by the building. Inspired as to its possibilities he applied for a position at Bauhaus as a painter, which he was successful in October 1895. He worked for Bauhaus for five years, from 1895 to 1900 and had opportunities to travel extensively, both within Germany and abroad, due to his job. During his time there he was given opportunities to work in a variety of medium, using collage, oil painting, print and paper cuts. He also wrote for Bauhaus, as a teacher.\n\nIn October 1900 Busch travelled to Paris, which was where he spent the last sixteen years of his life.","token_len":288,"entropy":[8.2465,6.1206,6.9469,9.7066,11.2461,0.6793,0.2612,7.5359,7.14,4.8059,8.7399,9.5536,6.3109,1.2489,1.4786,3.0032,0.0009,2.9009,6.3415,0.5269,3.8275,4.8797,3.0113,4.3889,7.0169,7.1781,8.2705,4.5437,0.3986,1.1715,1.1509,4.211,9.4917,3.5674,16.6163,0.6072,2.311,6.6124,2.952,0.6248,2.6869,4.1866,3.1733,4.458,0.8419,2.9227,3.6233,0.8386,2.2184,1.3529,6.4655,1.7042,0.9794,4.9525,0.9138,6.3418,1.3589,3.9124,2.9931,0.0305,1.6791,0.4129,0.0014,2.9819,6.5235,0.0504,3.0382,1.0404,6.12,0.9526,3.9941,0.3186,0.0428,0.0044,1.2967,4.6108,5.1571,9.4465,1.2081,5.4668,0.0091,1.4614,7.6342,1.5322,2.2764,0.0015,4.2107,0.3988,3.221,2.5194,0.0152,0.0159,0.0044,0.8449,2.3962,1.8664,0.0226,3.9717,0.8008,0.0986,0.8289,4.1573,3.7054,5.7772,2.3877,1.697,2.8808,3.8311,0.0037,3.5356,7.8683,0.8144,7.5843,1.6517,4.6542,2.6842,2.2885,1.3646,0.0127,0.013,0.0067,2.2787,2.4537,2.588,1.5642,2.6494,1.15,5.8498,6.4647,7.4498,4.9047,1.3715,1.7706,0.0416,2.2164,4.5504,1.4754,0.5402,5.8754,2.385,0.154,2.9421,0.7796,1.186,6.3645,0.0023,5.7565,0.3574,2.8039,1.8247,1.4062,4.2652,5.7557,0.0539,1.6883,6.149,2.3073,0.0412,2.4511,3.0868,4.8361,0.7183,0.9735,5.5362,3.3338,7.8815,6.1373,6.258,4.1654,6.0094,3.5578,4.9569,1.0318,0.8972,2.5972,1.3228,3.6787,0.1636,0.0052,3.7625,0.8234,2.2324,1.8834,3.4501,1.0301,2.3749,4.2553,0.4585,9.8872,0.7119,0.4001,1.8537,3.672,1.9415,3.2441,0.042,0.0025,1.3349,3.2614,0.3978,0.9838,3.7638,3.8307,0.4105,2.9942,2.8363,4.1267,8.3755,0.5709,4.3506,3.3658,2.5175,5.3128,4.3701,1.4822,0.079,0.9657,1.7001,7.2772,0.0933,0.5753,6.5676,2.3452,2.9315,1.3957,1.157,1.5453,0.8163,2.6101,4.6012,3.3709,0.2577,2.2872,1.8368,3.383,1.5795,0.0019,5.6529,6.179,6.8124,7.4702,1.2735,0.7336,6.7746,0.4931,0.4589,6.1086,2.7761,3.6588,9.774,1.2941,1.4168,1.4287,5.4394,2.6744,3.2504,0.0414,0.0029,1.7605,3.8084,2.4101,4.2051,2.0034,1.546,0.0001,1.5044,3.7627,2.8119,1.2181,0.0025,3.7121,0.2468,2.1965,1.5032,4.1343,1.3307,4.5126,0.4029,3.4544,1.464,2.673,6.6297,0.6652,0.4715,0.0249,0.0556,0.2643]}

The case settled in 1215, when Isabella was recognized as an official royal daughter by the Patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nA devout Christian, Maria was buried in a vault beneath the southern tower of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where, according to tradition, she was entombed in a stone mausoleum.\n\nIt was tradition that whenever a king died in Jerusalem - either by assassination or by natural death - he was laid to rest beneath the mausoleum. In 1387, workmen found Maria's body, sealed in a sarcophagus and with her corpse pierced by thorns. Only a few bones remained.\n\nAccording to tradition, Maria was carried in state to the tomb. On her way, she stopped to kiss the Cross and pray, and then ordered everyone to leave her and to \"clean the place in peace\".\n\nThe tomb of Maria of Aragon lies directly beneath the high altar. At the far end of her crypt lies the sepulchre where her grandson, the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI ( King of England and King of France ), was buried after his assassination.","token_len":289,"entropy":[9.1495,5.2445,0.2948,5.6058,0.265,1.0644,4.0152,1.5684,1.2746,7.2891,0.5774,1.0425,1.6208,5.0208,9.1489,3.821,0.3691,3.439,2.8255,4.2945,1.0309,6.5954,1.9038,3.2,2.4075,6.0016,3.9246,6.2486,8.5371,5.0582,3.9214,9.8116,7.409,9.994,6.2598,3.7378,1.3172,5.6656,0.0003,1.9852,0.238,3.1094,1.0701,2.2502,2.6837,6.4632,0.8308,9.6381,8.4687,1.8219,5.4949,2.8089,3.1025,5.6457,3.9149,1.8583,2.459,3.7293,4.5458,1.8811,1.4478,1.8165,0.8172,2.9733,2.4623,0.0001,1.4244,7.1501,0.3676,3.7325,3.1036,5.8097,1.94,1.5121,1.1476,6.2822,0.882,1.4008,0.8813,1.5931,0.3411,4.1309,7.4974,1.7752,0.7968,2.9178,1.3198,5.0097,0.8886,1.8624,5.915,3.8091,0.5539,8.243,3.5826,0.1575,0.7538,3.2874,0.1222,1.2467,1.7252,0.7296,0.0007,0.3882,0.0027,1.9465,2.7953,5.0379,1.0553,0.0008,2.4057,0.035,0.9987,0.836,6.2322,0.0364,0.0002,1.2731,1.0852,4.5878,5.534,0.5737,0.0001,0.0,1.3735,2.4217,0.0004,4.4269,1.1142,10.0225,0.4332,8.6082,1.4252,3.5659,2.2967,2.4494,3.4782,6.8653,4.1385,2.6231,3.7397,0.2367,1.071,3.4355,3.4087,0.2299,1.4711,1.2537,6.6628,0.6056,0.0066,4.4234,0.4275,2.3405,0.0026,0.0008,0.0029,0.8603,3.1148,4.3161,5.3664,0.5452,12.9412,0.4779,3.7348,2.1324,1.1538,1.3174,2.7438,6.6781,0.9467,0.3968,4.4431,0.0034,0.0048,2.7785,5.5017,2.0649,4.9525,8.858,1.6074,9.257,0.2393,1.0985,6.2401,1.8192,0.659,7.308,1.2535,1.6497,0.914,0.0004,4.1378,0.003,3.2621,0.0781,2.5256,1.1894,5.865,3.3467,8.466,1.3268,1.1198,1.7049,3.8706,3.8298,1.2018,3.1578,2.6539,0.4898,5.7012,2.1066,3.7621,1.3503,6.7288,1.7754,3.625,2.4561,2.0395,2.2297,6.889,4.9451,0.4655,3.8505,2.5362,3.5314,3.4636,4.186,5.1338,4.014,2.5825,4.2899,3.9834,2.2108,0.739,0.0004,2.2377,2.2003,2.8234,2.3538,3.3593,3.8582,3.3134,5.9482,6.228,2.1872,0.2026,7.0713,2.0519,3.2602,4.8202,0.6435,4.7234,0.5019,0.4683,3.6229,5.098,3.6341,1.1566,5.7018,0.0078,0.2253,0.1528,2.6152,1.7241,8.1338,1.3787,3.1873,4.0972,1.4556,0.1739,5.5464,2.8012,2.1601,6.4386,1.3698,2.2086,2.4904,4.0535,0.0759,1.2615,1.4087,1.2275,0.3199,4.7591,0.7013,4.3747,1.4349]}

{"id":3402,"ended":true,"length":250,"text":"An unfinished pyramid located in north Abusir, between the sun temple of Userkaf and the Pyramid of Sahure, is believed to belong to Shepseskare. The structure was discovered in 1980 by a young French engineer, who was surprised to find an underground pit full of rubble around an unfinished, rectangular pyramid resembling the one seen on the relief of King Taharqa-Sekhmet at Karnak, built between 1400 \u2013 1300 BC. Although this relief is widely regarded as a mythological composition, the discovery of a much older structure, albeit unfinished, at this spot has raised suspicion that this pyramid belongs to the legendary Egyptian queen.\n\nOn one side of the pyramid, two stone pylons are visible. One pyramid is built from granite blocks while the second has a brick and granite foundation. The top of the brick and granite structure seems to have been decorated with a hieroglyphic inscription. Most likely, a third part of the pyramid was destroyed in antiquity.\n\nThe pyramid is connected by a tunnel with the Pyramid of Sahure, which was also discovered in Abusir. The find shows that the pyramids of Abusir and Sahure were connected or had some relationship with each other. Both pyramids have the same footprint and similar architectural style, as well as common inscriptions.

After the game, the sides ran on to the pitch to hug each other, something which was banned for 30 years following the Heysel stadium disaster in 1985.[2][3] The cup was the third European competition Real achieved with this cup performance.[4] In addition to the final defeat, Real and Barcelona also reached the Copa del Rey final, which Real won 1\u20130.[5] It is estimated that, in total, Real Madrid won \u20ac15 million (approximately \u00a37.3 million) from the prize money.[6]","token_len":291,"entropy":[10.3814,9.927,6.5198,0.7236,0.2932,4.3914,3.3772,5.3717,2.3537,4.2752,4.3273,1.925,0.7209,9.3218,9.3425,2.2161,3.5645,0.0106,4.085,4.3142,4.8268,3.6756,1.0792,4.4724,0.74,1.0851,12.3761,2.4355,6.7749,0.005,2.1248,7.1663,0.0011,4.0554,1.0397,2.2482,1.5582,0.2858,5.6432,0.0333,0.1607,1.316,2.0545,3.8989,6.1683,3.9499,0.0102,5.0319,2.3976,0.9332,3.2459,4.5037,0.9112,6.5598,2.8417,1.4615,7.3266,3.3837,2.621,2.6001,1.5863,2.1107,3.1153,0.1463,4.0163,0.5913,2.2916,4.2304,1.3679,3.9827,3.2815,4.3285,6.829,5.7627,0.8382,4.1294,5.7622,0.3362,4.8483,0.0798,6.5607,0.3195,1.8897,0.0786,0.3925,0.0822,0.3315,2.1079,2.1642,2.414,4.509,1.6925,7.0105,2.9164,1.5358,0.9989,5.9342,7.9378,7.1895,2.5616,2.9679,1.7104,3.0702,3.0271,1.2108,2.4927,5.3,0.8601,0.6897,8.8297,2.5706,0.3609,4.5634,1.2081,1.6769,0.0017,3.1149,0.652,4.9121,0.0869,1.5174,0.0637,0.112,3.5367,3.7678,0.1508,4.6547,6.3861,2.8074,3.4496,0.5507,4.4359,2.1673,0.9862,5.5038,1.2281,5.2303,3.4916,0.3631,0.066,6.98,7.7596,0.1741,0.3195,1.5938,3.404,5.1731,0.449,1.6115,2.5748,5.152,0.3685,4.8429,0.5775,2.6214,0.1125,1.3151,1.8654,5.506,2.202,0.34,0.6959,0.3327,1.3323,1.4049,7.3693,2.0663,3.7773,1.0945,3.8133,1.4489,4.1737,0.0106,5.2399,2.3239,6.541,2.085,0.0607,0.9879,1.3583,0.5903,3.8895,1.4902,2.0578,0.1709,1.967,6.8119,7.1456,3.8454,1.1764,0.8992,5.4403,2.0781,7.9197,1.6823,0.0133,1.2406,8.1773,2.6085,2.1422,7.9303,3.2321,5.6415,1.3373,5.7516,0.4696,11.3348,0.7575,7.5093,2.1417,1.6985,4.2691,7.2204,2.8467,2.5201,0.2611,0.3466,3.167,7.6258,2.3979,3.7517,4.0719,4.8551,2.5905,7.1746,7.8831,4.0483,4.1909,4.7137,12.1636,3.1313,0.3148,0.1963,3.3333,4.3225,0.739,1.0023,4.7271,7.0356,0.8574,0.7643,5.4614,4.8957,3.0106,3.9378,0.108,4.2069,0.0012,0.7368,0.0028,1.3756,1.3429,2.1425,4.8306,1.3472,3.3409,0.0776,0.3051,2.9451,0.299,0.1383,5.0544,2.6287,4.1898,0.1343,4.8116,1.5043,3.6614,0.0452,1.6354,0.561,1.5068,5.0022,4.2585,0.8753,2.6677,3.0515,1.7931,3.3289,0.8524,2.4548,0.0733,0.5783,2.3538,0.7623,5.7694,0.9708,3.6298,0.2407,0.1667]}

{"id":3629,"ended":true,"length":248,"text":"Like other mackerel sharks, bigeye threshers are ovoviviparous and bear litters of two pups, one in each uterus. Very rarely, the litter size may be one, three, or four young. Pregnant females often travel great distances during gestation, so they can feed on smaller species such as tuna and sailfish while resting at sea off their feeding grounds. As the largest shark species in the North Atlantic Ocean ( 1- 5 m (3-16 ft ) in length ), the bigeye thresher may feed on larger prey in the open water. Its prey is believed to be a mix and includes sharks and bony and cartilaginous fish. It is occasionally also reported to feed on carrion.\n\nThe young often stay in the nest. Once they are large enough to leave the nest, they are fed by their mother on a diet of squid. As threshers reproduce asexually, the population always recovers more quickly than that of many other sharks, which must rely on inbreeding to replenish populations. Once a thresher has given birth, it no longer has to feed. Its greatest danger to survival is by being caught in commercial fisheries, which sometimes target and catch it in its calving grounds. Thus, bigeye threshers are among the species most often protected by the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species ( CITES ).","token_len":291,"entropy":[6.0238,10.0077,4.5218,0.0069,10.7247,0.4958,8.0416,5.2353,9.4953,3.0016,0.5014,1.5652,11.2916,7.4712,1.0326,2.1615,0.0689,0.0772,1.7742,7.6115,10.0821,0.8504,0.8018,4.4213,6.269,0.5918,2.3126,2.3641,3.2005,0.9753,7.9364,0.5594,8.3052,3.1324,0.9119,2.6618,6.3854,5.5175,3.7376,0.6806,5.1932,4.4458,3.8053,0.7297,0.3957,1.2438,5.2324,0.7079,6.4817,2.2232,0.014,1.3447,3.5368,7.1067,8.2977,0.0108,3.5543,2.817,1.0249,3.0934,1.9899,2.6677,4.4303,0.7617,4.4884,5.7143,3.0532,0.0014,4.5172,1.4561,9.593,1.0248,5.3641,7.0328,3.1741,1.6304,6.8933,3.6994,6.7792,0.4823,0.2286,4.9105,2.0347,7.1353,3.8166,3.2755,1.1317,0.5463,5.2285,0.9517,2.8514,3.857,10.1953,4.855,6.7988,2.8716,2.6862,2.2766,0.522,5.078,0.4008,3.4511,2.2944,0.4454,4.0741,1.6469,1.3424,0.0481,0.5783,0.005,1.2546,4.4309,2.8527,0.5518,3.0326,3.2447,4.3388,1.0891,3.7926,2.4349,1.3667,5.8142,4.5816,1.6419,7.5861,0.0314,0.4837,2.8205,6.2093,7.7709,9.5576,4.534,2.3288,4.9218,1.5791,5.724,7.0588,0.6665,0.0016,0.0056,1.7907,1.3842,3.0406,0.9628,6.5755,4.5764,5.1065,0.4676,2.062,0.1402,6.916,0.1134,0.0029,2.8681,1.7801,0.0045,2.1397,5.4164,5.1031,5.1425,1.2238,0.9215,2.7096,4.5087,4.309,1.7965,0.9743,5.7859,0.0445,0.5473,5.686,0.7758,0.361,0.3296,0.6643,1.8895,3.4798,1.641,2.2185,1.1808,3.426,1.7255,2.6581,0.6601,4.8349,3.281,4.267,9.1059,0.0603,0.2125,4.8529,6.5266,6.2457,0.0007,0.2563,1.7923,6.0202,7.5917,5.606,6.9049,0.9685,1.3927,4.6076,0.508,5.2462,0.5922,1.3168,1.8244,2.42,4.6864,4.3532,0.352,7.4087,0.2297,1.0445,4.96,0.0026,6.1667,0.432,4.6509,2.0869,2.7415,0.0449,0.0064,1.4578,5.6986,0.1732,0.7469,1.6886,7.6545,0.007,2.1423,0.4895,3.1243,2.7657,4.2122,7.4311,3.0886,2.6338,4.8229,0.3496,5.1859,2.8583,3.3758,1.247,8.6812,2.1528,1.5692,1.9058,5.6249,6.4769,5.33,2.5295,4.1474,2.1098,4.9546,10.6351,0.296,4.946,0.5096,6.2623,0.3446,4.2275,0.0749,0.2607,0.0013,0.0765,1.0801,4.7493,0.0834,5.98,0.7981,3.2163,6.8036,1.0567,0.9626,4.7317,3.8327,0.1828,0.561,0.0529,7.7891,0.2665,0.0001,0.7285,1.2582,2.1263,4.2289,0.4326,1.2373]}

The remainder is owned by the federal government.\n\nThe natural resources of the upper Yakima River Basin of southwestern Washington are rich in minerals, timber, and natural gas. It is now being increasingly developed for agriculture and urban and industrial purposes primarily for export to the Pacific Northwest and the rest of the United States. Agriculture occupies the largest share of our lands (about 38 %) because of the region's climate and soil conditions. Most of our forested areas were deforested in the past 100 years. About 1.5 million acres (2 million hectare s) have grown back as forests as a result of restoration efforts in the past twenty years. Yakima County has about 80,000 acres (32,500 hectares) of land set aside in the State Conservation Reserve Program and Conservation Reserve Program. At this time, conservation of our water resources is the priority. The Potlatch Reservoir supplies drinking water to the Yakima Valley and provides recreation and other benefits to the county. The Potlatch Project is currently under construction, and its development would affect surface and underground water resources. The PACT Act will allow further agricultural developments in the area as long as they are planned and carried out in a scientific manner.","token_len":292,"entropy":[8.1823,7.1261,3.0132,6.9346,5.7455,0.0242,0.6013,12.1142,7.6924,0.0232,2.9588,3.6178,1.2792,3.9404,5.2457,5.3834,0.0841,1.9057,4.4166,0.6393,2.426,1.5233,9.2168,0.0381,0.3303,10.7,1.4509,0.1288,0.6815,3.2769,1.39,6.001,0.2461,4.8868,5.1732,0.0587,10.6709,1.4037,0.6924,10.1026,0.0718,6.4004,0.5895,0.0243,0.6328,2.2907,3.9828,0.6489,2.9988,0.1489,1.2867,3.347,0.113,0.7539,1.7009,0.0014,1.7934,6.9963,1.8275,1.4475,0.5774,7.018,4.6359,0.0096,2.2328,2.7103,6.9942,5.1149,1.3892,1.0427,4.3011,0.5093,2.3019,1.1171,4.7472,0.2912,1.1708,2.9668,0.8172,0.5748,4.214,0.5424,6.0068,5.4909,6.5795,5.136,2.0206,3.1514,1.1918,7.4159,5.4582,1.604,2.5308,7.7932,2.7635,3.7063,1.8791,1.3725,3.2878,0.4099,1.8289,1.8266,5.1275,0.0042,0.3132,1.2438,0.0031,0.2095,7.055,6.2249,2.161,1.9823,1.0775,0.0453,5.9682,3.8947,4.2772,3.3013,4.6568,0.2973,1.1855,6.1568,0.7381,1.1627,6.4162,0.0162,5.9943,1.2655,4.9375,1.7019,0.5983,5.004,0.3519,1.2203,5.1601,3.7923,1.9583,4.359,7.3602,0.0115,0.0018,1.1192,0.1479,3.0515,3.7412,0.0799,1.2077,4.3679,3.9366,1.7289,1.2886,0.7475,0.3536,2.6624,3.0343,2.1167,5.8754,0.2065,9.9399,0.7122,3.2177,6.1395,5.7061,4.2011,3.1204,5.704,1.1327,0.1317,0.037,6.7146,1.2334,2.6768,0.4612,0.9616,5.9007,0.2397,0.253,8.3298,0.0094,4.5973,1.7574,3.1443,4.6473,1.7912,0.0185,0.8225,1.4915,5.3087,0.3465,2.6287,1.1393,0.2197,0.1075,2.3125,7.801,0.0079,4.147,1.1474,4.8178,4.4156,3.1657,4.5631,3.353,8.9974,2.3631,2.5523,1.6796,5.3531,3.2632,0.576,0.6539,5.8956,2.8968,2.4803,5.318,0.9341,0.6688,2.6644,4.5692,1.4987,2.4649,5.897,0.0186,0.0001,6.4029,0.0296,5.7167,5.049,0.0108,0.6227,2.1376,2.0227,0.0085,1.8696,1.3499,3.9383,5.0231,2.429,4.3756,2.4136,0.6179,0.7614,6.4068,0.6565,1.8857,3.0173,0.0058,0.0002,8.0162,1.4923,4.2066,2.708,0.9076,2.4279,1.0643,4.1151,4.454,4.2785,4.8453,8.3968,2.7534,4.3156,0.655,2.2437,1.4528,2.0125,6.2471,8.2762,6.3362,3.8133,2.8279,7.0264,7.4367,5.6413,1.3396,0.4391,1.8541,3.64,3.551,0.0023,2.3197,0.9069,5.3373,1.4896,4.5578,0.0064,1.2502,1.248,7.5806,1.5675,0.4673]}

Zoic Studios' proprietary, digital, computer-generated sets, costumes, and props -- including the evil Hook -- are meant to enhance the storytelling, not distract from it.\n\nSo how do the sets contribute? Well, let's take a look at this week's sneak preview reel. The video starts with a shot of a massive ship, which is said to be one of the largest sets the show has ever built, and that isn't an exaggeration. That ship looks like it's as tall as Cinderella's castle in Fantasyland!\n\nThe big ship is part of a whaling vessel used by the Black Swan to abduct fairies. It's docked in front of a quaint harbor village that is the site of the Black Swan's lair.\n\nAccording to Disneyland News Blog, the harbor is the home of the Black Swan's ship and where she was spotted last year.\n\nThe sets also include an abandoned town that will be where the Once crew goes to obtain a fairy for Emma's spell, a town filled with trees that can fly and a mansion with a spooky tree house.\n\nIf you want to get a behind-the-scenes look at more of Zoic Studios' work, you can check it out on their YouTube page.","token_len":292,"entropy":[9.8112,5.2723,7.8896,0.9389,9.0984,0.4822,12.9729,0.0686,0.223,0.0439,1.6139,8.8392,9.7278,12.3468,13.2947,6.6249,4.6614,9.3419,7.1472,2.2486,7.3752,4.0487,3.5577,8.3024,0.4222,1.7843,3.0193,5.8055,0.1494,0.5341,6.4149,1.7014,2.8431,1.1554,14.9769,7.6176,5.9769,3.1194,9.1764,3.596,6.2043,2.3922,6.4165,0.7056,1.0286,6.7732,2.4909,3.8083,0.4296,1.1809,3.236,6.7357,2.9078,1.4192,9.1732,9.9829,3.1578,1.0991,5.2926,0.1697,5.2975,0.6094,5.2486,2.2168,2.3821,5.2567,0.8427,0.2398,0.526,2.454,0.0024,4.9984,3.2362,2.0227,3.3448,3.8995,7.6055,3.031,2.5043,0.1099,4.706,0.0597,1.6859,0.3996,0.1783,0.5253,5.0002,3.6745,0.0183,6.3689,1.9258,5.273,1.239,2.9032,5.9002,3.9102,1.1319,1.2652,3.4699,0.2204,1.5497,5.8684,5.9754,2.4459,3.0765,1.7005,5.2227,0.0225,0.7574,4.801,0.1363,0.2999,2.5149,3.7226,4.3473,1.4087,0.1213,0.2533,4.1766,2.2019,1.3609,4.3354,6.4969,0.0017,4.308,1.0506,0.2346,4.7849,1.0284,3.3909,1.2398,1.0914,1.2795,6.4643,2.4659,0.0688,7.8686,0.9643,1.3345,3.7291,7.0378,0.2592,3.8421,1.4972,0.0002,1.9283,4.5394,3.1583,1.2147,6.0245,0.0341,0.9488,9.0939,3.1864,3.2471,5.6877,1.1103,1.1446,6.0783,3.6492,2.2042,7.7966,8.5038,0.1968,1.6728,2.2865,0.7637,9.4262,0.1029,0.945,6.8437,0.0049,1.4684,9.5997,4.7672,5.2873,3.7498,2.0659,3.4705,2.5335,0.0177,1.2641,3.6991,0.0222,1.2829,5.4025,0.5491,2.3627,0.0003,5.9044,0.0019,8.9366,5.735,5.7764,0.6663,1.0059,6.6284,2.0197,3.0667,3.0177,0.1801,1.1098,2.3305,0.0034,1.1853,5.4653,2.6075,6.6064,3.466,2.6512,5.2013,3.6068,0.7578,0.5358,1.514,0.0002,1.5175,6.5087,2.5021,1.1503,3.0234,5.9223,5.9878,3.0862,5.1682,1.3041,6.4458,0.8404,10.489,8.6068,4.8047,1.3259,6.9585,2.1779,7.7419,4.3567,6.5795,2.443,8.6769,2.5072,2.0141,3.5148,4.3931,0.0258,5.5337,1.5933,3.5604,6.7426,1.6922,2.2033,5.7201,2.4786,0.994,6.6588,0.8499,4.9476,1.6831,0.7493,0.4259,0.0002,4.7788,0.3963,2.5277,0.306,3.3244,1.0355,6.0997,0.2786,0.0141,0.0076,0.0114,0.1372,0.1714,6.6986,0.3117,4.3462,0.0027,0.4827,0.0943,2.0741,0.3602,1.5339,0.2206,1.2822,3.8381,0.0093,1.9353,1.1781,2.8981,1.1471,0.4441]}

Sixteen speakers from within the Wiccan and Pagan community came to talk at the venue, on the history of the group. The first speaker was Doreen Valiente herself, and the focus of her talk was Wicca in the prison, the role of women and the impact of institutionalisation on Pagan culture.\n\nDoreen told her story of the birth of the group, and then described the difficulties she faced trying to make sense of how the prison system could help to reawaken and give meaning to one's Pagan spirituality, how she felt her experiences could help other women and how she got involved in other projects.\n\nThe day was a great success as those present all agreed that it really did offer a different perspective on Paganism as a whole, something that really did help to challenge much of the traditional stereotype of Paganism that people often hold.\n\nIt felt like a big family day out where everyone was treated equally and no one was trying to make themselves feel superior to others.

{"id":924,"ended":true,"length":254,"text":"During the post @ - @ independence period, Mogadishu International Airport offered flights to numerous global destinations. In the mid @ - @ 1960s, the airport was enlarged to accommodate more international flights. During the 1970s, the airport offered flight facilities to a variety of domestic destinations, including Mogadishu, Beledweyne, Warka, Baidoa, Galkayo, Balad, Baarma & Baidoa. These were offered primarily by smaller local airlines. In the 1980s, the airport was enlarged, and the domestic services became a priority. This led to a significant decrease in the capacity of the international services due to security and safety issues. Following the formation of the Federal Republic of Somalia, the national carrier Somali Air Services (SAS) began services to several international destinations. This was followed by the establishment of three other national airline carriers (Transworld Airlines, Somaliland Airlines and Somali Airways) in the mid-1990s. The number of foreign airlines operating at Mogadishu has been small due to security concerns and the effects of Somali Civil War. In 2005, an attempt was made to construct a modern civil airport at Mogadishu. The project was unsuccessful due to lack of sufficient funds. At present Mogadishu airport offers a few international and domestic flight services. At present the airport is still served by Somaliland Airlines and Transworld Airlines, although Somaliland Airlines is in serious financial difficulties.","token_len":293,"entropy":[1.9437,6.2524,10.8183,10.2397,4.6308,11.9275,7.086,1.4784,11.6104,1.8949,0.0024,7.7997,0.7607,6.7834,4.0405,0.6509,8.3968,7.3808,0.7278,1.724,3.8246,2.6001,4.6507,8.9869,1.4779,0.5933,2.7433,0.3076,0.6014,2.1469,1.2342,2.2063,7.3978,0.7767,1.3992,2.5821,1.5163,1.1711,0.7103,4.5171,0.7262,4.798,0.0799,0.5584,1.5011,0.2738,4.5554,3.8657,7.1602,1.0876,4.0516,2.119,0.0077,6.3923,3.3739,2.2207,0.389,7.784,0.0006,0.0012,1.0426,6.227,11.19,7.8508,6.2105,0.2467,5.7343,6.2536,1.7597,0.6319,4.4035,4.6058,0.5233,0.2805,5.1809,8.0123,5.428,3.1636,0.3152,6.7662,4.1562,0.8102,7.4222,11.7732,5.8627,3.3165,3.2888,0.0563,0.7655,4.9273,3.6356,4.3913,4.7593,2.0265,7.7537,4.4041,0.7686,1.2438,2.0945,1.1788,1.7846,0.0319,0.3491,1.4179,0.1834,1.9828,3.9566,4.6149,1.5199,2.1182,7.8426,4.4792,3.2567,3.7,3.4034,0.9927,4.0085,4.6088,0.0816,1.6616,2.8719,3.0817,0.0441,1.5014,5.17,0.2188,0.6241,4.2332,2.8762,5.6535,0.0084,5.2578,2.6665,3.5066,1.1884,0.4236,5.5723,0.7383,6.9219,0.0141,0.5878,4.2907,3.6121,0.0807,0.2259,1.4915,1.1729,5.3748,3.9816,4.7982,2.4062,3.6435,1.8741,0.304,0.8644,0.2265,2.044,5.7307,1.0544,3.7208,1.2374,0.181,1.3029,3.1928,2.4133,1.8486,0.1356,1.3542,2.9466,0.0551,5.6527,4.5719,2.2167,4.8422,2.3411,2.6622,7.8132,8.2835,2.623,0.2666,6.4666,0.9176,0.7831,0.9632,1.0604,3.4372,1.9191,0.9153,1.3594,1.5474,1.6446,0.9594,0.9443,0.008,0.3703,1.9876,4.3988,0.032,3.6571,2.2464,2.0881,3.8865,1.5648,0.0002,0.0024,2.3994,2.066,5.8677,3.4061,0.0148,2.9012,1.0145,1.6378,1.8233,7.0085,0.075,4.1208,5.6323,0.1845,0.9681,2.0394,4.1333,0.2249,4.1995,4.3986,0.3236,0.0492,0.1935,6.873,0.4169,4.9116,6.3499,3.6193,2.3505,1.4191,0.0002,0.0015,1.0654,1.3116,1.9961,0.4109,2.3042,1.131,0.0125,2.9593,0.0018,4.2296,1.1302,1.0021,4.4232,3.8696,6.3643,0.0005,0.0029,1.8528,3.6559,2.4221,4.3405,1.0525,4.0244,0.3224,3.995,0.9771,1.3526,4.1246,2.6089,1.9064,0.7433,0.9482,3.9968,6.8266,0.0724,5.9474,0.2293,0.0128,0.5991,1.6476,4.524,0.2566,0.4524,2.0454,3.2771,5.0267,0.0268,0.0026,0.8355,1.6058,4.4457,6.2112,2.0559,0.8642,0.6526]}
{"id":1838,"ended":false,"length":271,"text":"The surface composition of Ceres is broadly similar to that of C @ - @ type asteroids. Some differences do exist. The ubiquitous features in Ceres'IR spectrum are those of hydrated minerals. [ 9 ] As shown below, Ceres has a much greater abundance of \"hydrated species\" such as hematite ( Fe, WO 3 ), sulfate ( SO 4 ) and \"quaternary\" halite ( Fe + W + SO 4 ) than C @ - @ asteroids. [ 9 ]\n\nC, H, and water are very important in this area. Water is by far the most significant of these species due to its high reactivity. It also possesses the least number of isotopic varieties [ 9 ]. The abundance and chemistry of the other hydrated minerals on Ceres are not as well known. However, it has been previously suggested that sulfate may be of water origin [ 10 ].\n\nIt has also been proposed that sulfuric acid is more reactive and that is can be produced by the hydrolysis of water in situ. This would be accompanied by the release of hydrogen sulfide, which has a small atmosphere, or possibly by the condensation of clouds and precipitation of carbon dioxide. Both of these processes are known as chemical water splitting and are well within current theoretical capabilities. The detection of sulfuric acid in the spectra of the IR bands would suggest that water is present at or below the freezing point of water.

He also worked as the head track coach at Kansas State and had previously worked in that capacity both at Lawrence High School and Washburn Normal School. During his time there he was given a leave of absence in 1914 because of a heart condition and only returned to the same position one year later.

{"id":2165,"ended":true,"length":246,"text":"The host spectrum of the Amylostereaceae comprises several, partially very different genera of < unk >. A. chailletii usually infests Pinaceae such as firs ( Abies ) and spruces ( Picea ), while the other species usually affect woody climbers. The most important species A. chailletii has recently been recorded from the southern part of the Alps. It infests the Alps from the southern tip of the Apennines to the western side of the Carpathians up to the Alps, where it forms a scattered, sometimes dense, forest, in some places quite extensive. At the present time, the forest and stands of this species are found sporadically, and only two collections were collected between 1780 and 1831. The specimens were probably taken from the central part because the species is often recorded on the eastern side as well. The first collection occurred at Prato di Fiesole ( Vicenza ), the second between Ponte Fosso and Lomme ( in the province Pordenone ). The genus has been reported both from the natural and the cultivated state. The latter has also given rise to the observation that fruiting bodies develop from small branches, or shoots of woody climbers, some specimens even fruiting from ferns ( Pteridium sp. L. ). The fruit bodies contain several black, globular fruits with many longish spines ( > 2 mm).","token_len":296,"entropy":[8.4921,12.8438,1.4931,1.9307,8.5763,6.9192,9.2636,5.589,10.0365,6.4669,3.8667,6.4269,8.2583,10.7455,2.3717,3.0228,0.0015,2.7107,9.7553,12.3271,7.1346,7.0851,4.1305,3.8451,4.434,5.5263,10.0527,5.1679,1.9989,7.6107,8.612,1.5798,11.859,2.5907,5.2692,0.0121,7.7013,4.1121,3.1727,12.0911,5.317,4.3,0.3596,4.6507,4.1254,0.3629,0.159,4.7221,6.3303,0.7129,1.6607,1.5595,2.6181,3.0926,3.3022,4.4633,6.3963,7.0597,0.846,9.8246,1.5274,1.9941,3.3614,3.8111,2.5382,8.8711,0.0498,0.7824,0.031,0.0116,0.0036,4.3586,6.4907,0.335,5.1549,2.228,1.4353,4.15,2.4415,0.0099,1.3238,4.177,1.9047,2.0915,6.8691,0.1589,2.0083,4.3643,3.5859,1.2889,3.3585,2.1757,0.1039,0.7502,6.9573,0.418,0.6366,0.839,0.2843,3.6526,4.7166,0.1227,0.3877,6.9785,0.3435,1.2269,8.6338,0.1236,0.4869,2.5544,2.5081,2.6022,0.2189,4.0935,1.1688,9.539,3.238,5.4438,4.3002,1.7425,3.1307,3.3196,4.5179,4.3829,2.5682,5.6805,5.4424,0.6082,5.2928,0.899,4.3648,0.3563,1.0126,1.8907,4.578,4.3851,10.7345,0.8532,1.7421,1.1239,0.5275,5.4379,8.6195,0.002,0.0002,2.5989,2.0214,4.9123,4.6259,7.4733,3.3014,1.9945,3.3174,4.5568,3.4758,0.0576,1.6585,5.0453,0.81,1.4286,5.3703,2.669,4.9234,3.2035,0.744,1.0294,4.6047,1.8334,12.2184,1.9537,4.6473,2.0005,4.2276,6.4156,3.5698,1.2264,4.675,1.1088,5.2476,3.1349,0.8878,1.4732,4.3622,0.7871,3.9946,2.7182,6.9403,4.739,4.0851,4.2671,6.5443,7.1627,2.5487,10.3741,0.1115,2.5649,3.2109,1.2837,5.4083,4.6436,3.3655,5.9155,5.353,2.8428,0.5851,4.4902,4.6279,4.8795,2.15,6.7084,2.4442,4.6991,6.8523,7.8969,3.9813,5.3767,1.9581,1.1875,5.1223,4.1673,0.8126,4.4219,6.4665,2.3158,1.1057,8.7845,1.6638,2.3618,3.7443,6.1432,1.8208,1.2571,4.4956,2.9515,4.0783,7.1026,1.8697,0.0201,1.2369,6.6594,0.7128,9.5205,0.0608,2.3227,6.5136,1.8581,4.3563,4.406,1.7095,3.8764,6.443,3.0262,3.2223,2.9095,6.7251,1.2348,5.6933,7.9691,4.6685,7.811,0.0802,0.5812,5.9659,1.3507,0.1897,2.7969,4.1238,7.2685,8.3299,5.7192,1.0903,5.3622,1.8335,1.7396,1.22,5.2279,5.533,5.3858,3.7722,8.5707,3.0867,7.3143,0.1667,3.3961,2.8694,4.3708,5.5725,8.5432,4.6396,0.0709,2.6659,8.0962,3.0626,1.8117,2.7688]}

Free safety Carter Wiley and cornerback Billy Myers had three interceptions each during the regular season. Virginia Tech will have to replace cornerbacks Brandon Facyson and Demetri Goodson -- who each recorded 22 tackles -- but it will retain plenty of firepower on the back end. Defensive end Frank Clarke is an All-SEC talent who recorded 14 sacks for an average of 1.63 per game. The defense got a boost last year with second-team All-American safety and team captain Quayvon Spencer, but if Spencer and the linebackers step up, look for the Hokies to dominate up front.\n\nOn offense, Tyrod Taylor got off to a good start last year but wasn't as effective down the stretch. Taylor was solid in the passing game (4,109 yards, 31 TDs), but the senior really let a winnable game slip out of his hands against Clemson in the ACC Championship Game (eight interceptions and three lost fumbles). In that loss, Taylor threw more than 100 passes for the first time in his career. He will have to limit his mistakes, or else Tennessee could take advantage of some mistakes. Junior wide receiver Ryan Broyles is the team's go-to guy and will have to shoulder the load -- he recorded 908 yards and 12 touchdowns last season. If Broyles is able to reach double digits in receptions, the Hokies will be confident in Taylor.","token_len":297,"entropy":[9.0844,0.9816,9.7811,6.8351,4.0922,1.5149,0.105,7.2105,1.7575,0.8423,0.1697,4.0449,1.3245,0.4311,1.5766,9.9106,2.9874,8.446,10.3197,3.4271,2.3242,7.2048,7.5243,3.5576,4.5751,0.7193,4.8189,4.6297,0.5833,1.7972,0.028,0.5275,8.3794,0.7315,5.3779,2.3705,0.6522,3.3302,8.7556,2.1406,4.1873,10.1667,0.2275,0.3799,5.7052,0.6846,2.5875,1.4166,0.7961,7.3468,1.8915,4.6896,4.3302,6.2347,0.5745,2.4538,4.301,2.558,2.3656,6.468,6.248,0.013,3.9777,2.2479,1.0218,5.2281,0.4075,0.4489,6.2761,1.1502,6.1245,8.8814,2.5865,4.0413,2.916,0.0255,4.6244,6.2518,1.6946,6.2914,4.3653,2.8892,4.1201,4.7322,1.0819,0.0322,2.6274,0.0113,5.2771,3.4106,0.1902,0.6391,2.137,3.3585,5.9282,2.1931,2.2662,4.652,1.4991,1.5395,6.3479,0.0796,2.9803,0.257,0.0088,1.8331,3.9384,5.3672,6.2331,1.0986,6.8493,3.673,1.0392,9.0256,2.5528,3.0817,5.7266,4.5243,2.8775,2.8318,6.5763,5.11,0.1026,0.7559,9.7142,0.4184,1.687,3.8991,0.0097,0.0291,5.7664,7.6723,0.2638,0.2863,1.2542,0.0003,6.2522,0.7558,0.0363,7.938,2.8075,0.0548,4.6826,2.7072,0.0058,0.1885,2.4988,0.0019,2.857,0.7798,4.4993,4.9876,0.0004,2.5936,2.1178,6.992,0.6241,0.0512,0.3877,2.3105,2.3813,5.3078,1.8283,1.2535,2.0317,0.0157,3.6757,3.2526,3.9101,6.2905,0.492,1.5997,4.7907,1.5009,1.5393,0.2724,2.396,4.6643,7.978,6.0835,4.6468,8.1855,5.4861,0.0007,0.8187,0.118,3.852,0.1394,0.4036,1.2366,4.8186,4.18,2.9543,0.6421,1.8556,0.9329,0.4028,5.3417,7.1577,2.7368,2.472,2.9328,7.5773,1.1098,0.0012,0.4524,4.3605,4.7982,3.6781,0.2081,0.7801,3.35,6.46,2.0388,3.4711,1.0588,3.0602,4.6072,1.4517,0.0774,0.6316,0.2813,0.2695,0.9932,2.1373,4.4065,1.2013,0.2697,7.483,1.4578,4.4849,2.2895,6.5272,1.7921,5.8704,2.52,4.3261,2.8735,0.1995,4.4874,5.1672,1.7178,7.0507,3.597,0.4785,5.5776,5.5129,0.0572,2.482,2.7696,3.3861,0.0409,5.1134,0.0401,0.0009,1.5575,2.1683,2.1506,1.4703,0.3909,6.6744,1.3542,0.9579,5.7323,1.7045,3.9325,5.5103,8.855,0.3181,0.9929,3.428,0.6928,1.6044,0.808,0.7804,4.2998,1.0385,0.0008,2.4924,1.1495,0.0006,5.8142,3.6409,0.7892,0.7757,2.1513,0.9154,1.7529,0.431,0.0099,1.1824,1.3315,5.5169,1.5915,4.2928,1.3438]}

About 30 were built, although almost all were scrapped before their delivery.","token_len":299,"entropy":[9.8925,8.572,12.3569,18.3835,4.5051,9.6816,0.7363,0.9475,10.3628,4.8429,2.9959,7.7695,11.04,5.9538,3.046,10.2779,11.4958,6.9966,8.9767,5.0937,4.1403,1.2822,6.8522,5.0404,0.0106,2.1084,6.6076,0.0315,1.9807,2.2792,0.002,7.7351,6.3592,11.7339,7.3473,0.9241,0.7749,1.6378,3.6899,6.5878,7.5375,0.7206,4.849,1.9517,7.4646,10.0139,0.6085,5.2529,0.7245,0.7601,3.9991,0.3906,2.4083,4.665,1.9841,4.667,7.5241,0.8342,4.1774,5.2331,4.315,7.6426,0.0042,0.0007,2.3011,3.431,7.1544,3.2012,0.0037,6.9235,1.717,3.6504,4.4324,2.0852,6.5741,6.553,1.1727,0.8193,3.2282,3.8642,0.2071,0.0756,5.4592,0.2348,0.7756,2.3897,1.5558,2.9532,3.0847,0.6991,3.4276,1.0652,1.1805,2.8667,1.1144,4.4185,5.6476,0.0938,6.1274,0.9862,0.1485,0.4607,0.2127,4.1415,0.1562,5.9897,8.0649,5.4728,1.9506,0.8993,4.9233,4.3775,3.3712,0.096,1.1511,0.1597,0.8511,5.3197,0.0131,0.1289,4.9204,7.0189,1.1449,5.2952,3.9469,6.6174,0.9814,4.2658,1.4328,4.3919,0.0961,5.8185,0.4351,8.4075,4.8104,3.0181,0.1522,5.318,1.8508,3.9341,5.7279,3.3265,0.0682,5.6729,4.1373,0.4441,3.9688,8.1129,0.9306,1.7202,8.7981,2.3487,2.2839,5.5168,1.1476,0.1044,5.3226,1.2151,7.5368,0.0998,8.2819,4.5755,7.2947,4.3272,4.44,0.4111,4.7251,2.2615,1.9709,3.3063,5.1711,3.5053,0.2459,5.3746,2.0664,9.0162,5.1383,0.9329,5.6428,0.9465,4.1193,7.4057,1.0602,4.3329,4.6679,3.8461,6.225,3.9995,0.4104,0.5871,5.4208,0.0014,0.0016,5.2871,3.0264,1.6886,1.8882,0.1517,6.4471,3.4952,1.8038,0.3495,0.5064,3.6139,0.1442,1.0483,1.6494,3.2846,0.004,0.0443,1.4881,3.41,4.5684,0.4381,5.4099,0.0851,0.0535,0.0619,1.6514,0.3188,6.075,0.9144,0.3678,0.0181,1.8019,2.9532,3.1939,3.5271,0.0525,0.6356,0.123,0.7382,7.2796,3.123,0.3446,0.0247,0.9047,3.0601,7.8485,0.029,5.8644,7.6199,5.9998,0.6454,5.2386,5.2841,7.3194,2.5375,5.991,0.7157,0.3441,2.9139,5.1011,0.2823,0.4999,3.983,6.0659,0.0779,0.9488,6.2594,1.5359,1.5344,2.4136,3.1301,0.8993,1.8483,0.6958,4.9988,0.0818,5.1901,1.8353,0.9426,0.0046,4.1493,0.9698,0.2515,5.298,0.518,0.3176,2.184,0.0061,0.0294,4.1134,1.2092,5.6323,3.6426,5.3764,1.5575,1.5406,5.5089,5.4412,0.3746,0.6918,3.1936,4.1635,2.9052,4.7772,1.0669]}
{"id":2457,"ended":false,"length":263,"text":"Mainstream evangelicalism has consistently opposed prosperity theology as heresy and prosperity ministries have frequently come into conflict with other Christian groups, including those within the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. Critics, such as the evangelical scholar Timothy George, have alleged that prosperity theology has a fundamental contradiction -- \"that God loves His children but, in the same breath, offers an exchange in which human beings can receive eternal rewards through the efforts of human beings.\"  Many churches of the charismatic movement reject the prosperity gospel, and the American charismatic Pentecostal movement, which generally denounces this teaching, constitutes a significant part of the worldwide charismatic and Pentecostal movements.\n\nAccording to evangelical scholar Timothy George, one key question in studying the prosperity gospel is \"What is good about it?\" His answer: \"The world as we know it does not have an 'eternal reward' for people who do not believe, and good works do not earn rewards. Yet in the prosperity gospel, God is not willing for the children of believers to suffer in this life, and so He gives them what they need. That is a wonderful doctrine that brings life to us who are in need.\"\n\nSee also\n Prosperity theology\n Bible code and divination in the Bible\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n \"Prosperity Gospel\" at Wikisource\n \"'In The Beginning Was The Word' and That Isn't a Bible Code\" at New Advent","token_len":299,"entropy":[9.0884,11.3601,3.3486,2.5166,5.9436,3.543,11.1295,7.604,3.3336,6.3753,1.5734,9.8913,6.084,1.4352,4.253,5.821,4.2929,0.9069,0.1632,5.037,2.7183,3.5281,2.6355,1.4707,3.4057,4.1369,0.7612,5.3479,0.0348,0.0,0.0309,3.7505,7.6091,0.0685,0.0197,1.9796,0.2568,7.8093,3.7717,1.8041,0.0008,2.0342,4.7277,3.9079,5.1561,7.5451,0.5271,1.2997,5.0498,0.1659,2.5051,1.3923,2.3995,3.6133,5.5645,4.3208,7.3872,5.1985,3.9986,2.7067,4.9097,3.336,1.9435,3.6729,5.6302,2.0647,2.0049,4.0668,4.1868,0.0672,6.3891,5.165,9.0014,4.5837,0.4897,6.4051,0.8681,3.0905,4.188,4.3517,3.4869,4.1373,1.4846,6.0683,0.0596,4.4574,2.1665,1.417,9.0132,10.3318,4.4239,4.9596,1.1138,6.9172,2.9635,4.4954,1.6452,2.6573,3.5478,1.4989,2.1418,3.0566,5.9473,6.9585,8.6084,0.0009,0.0,0.0546,1.7156,1.9938,1.3972,7.0933,6.8262,0.0218,6.2489,3.191,0.3437,10.4445,1.1733,2.9505,1.9392,0.0047,0.5084,5.0877,3.0396,4.462,3.1053,0.0022,0.0006,0.0169,2.7083,0.2713,1.7639,0.0049,5.0226,0.0989,5.945,2.489,3.4331,0.1864,0.1771,4.4516,4.6884,3.9862,2.2653,5.9806,0.7299,2.9105,0.8016,0.3957,2.1606,2.5827,1.2893,5.5011,4.6784,0.9809,0.3925,4.7152,3.0083,2.0241,0.6019,2.0188,5.4624,5.0075,1.1663,0.1728,0.0019,3.345,0.1205,2.472,3.4643,5.0751,5.9577,0.0541,0.4401,1.1646,1.1415,4.6026,0.7232,2.1153,1.3268,3.4435,4.2419,1.8648,5.3782,3.0506,2.2169,0.0428,4.8545,4.5091,1.3659,6.4698,3.8901,1.3046,3.905,0.0766,0.6436,2.4559,2.6825,3.2869,3.7074,4.9139,2.5224,4.8689,0.2422,4.5583,0.149,4.2289,2.8794,3.4945,1.9065,1.4655,2.1237,3.3724,2.2295,2.0761,0.7928,4.0973,0.5683,0.9456,2.4583,3.6974,0.5312,3.3926,4.7765,4.724,3.1104,5.7795,5.0369,0.6905,4.9113,5.714,1.4705,2.5261,1.8396,1.7587,1.2334,0.0003,6.4424,1.3132,2.0115,29.4963,0.062,4.0612,2.4538,23.6655,9.6659,3.201,9.6806,2.1794,3.8085,1.2224,2.536,0.7569,0.0003,5.6084,0.9419,0.0006,4.5008,0.5622,0.0005,5.4904,0.2471,0.4283,0.0002,5.4167,0.3626,4.5973,11.7543,6.5169,0.0862,0.0065,3.7719,1.7744,5.3086,6.9329,3.5893,0.2452,2.8881,21.6977,5.144,4.175,2.2969,3.4617,3.1992,2.2768,2.6842,2.962,7.8218,6.0834,0.0019,4.7505,3.9396,3.6413,1.0999,1.3564,4.8843,1.5066]}

Its sales have surpassed three million albums worldwide and five million in the United States alone.[2]In 2003, Illmatic won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, but Nas did not attend the ceremony.[23][24] In 2004, Nas was asked to rate his own album; he has claimed that its impact on the hip-hop scene was a \"major factor\", but he has also said that he did not think the album would last that long in popular memory.[25]\n\nIn 1999, Nas performed \"Ain't Nothing But a G Thang\" with Ice Cube at the 21st Annual Essence Music Festival.[26] In 2006, Nas performed \"Nas Is Like...\" with Lil' Kim and Puff Daddy at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards.[27] Nas also featured on Jay-Z's \"Hova,\" originally intended for release as a solo single by Nas, in 2003.[28]","token_len":300,"entropy":[5.5743,3.8179,7.0919,0.4477,11.041,4.5276,1.995,1.4666,4.731,1.5814,8.1931,5.2723,1.0332,2.5838,0.0236,0.1777,6.869,0.0196,3.939,1.7269,5.7846,2.048,0.2805,2.9455,0.1095,1.5218,4.9463,2.3458,10.9005,8.8833,0.4233,0.4461,0.4308,4.9734,5.7292,4.1131,17.0968,3.6127,1.9895,1.6877,2.4781,7.147,0.6203,0.5808,5.2494,1.1082,0.3641,6.4837,1.025,6.7416,5.2138,0.2741,4.9908,3.0658,0.4146,3.152,0.8366,2.2143,1.8241,7.462,4.8297,7.0321,1.522,4.9657,2.01,4.1417,0.7428,2.1466,0.7291,3.4174,1.4846,5.8572,3.1277,1.2571,0.1449,3.7169,6.287,7.2324,0.1153,0.7771,3.7302,1.6831,5.9601,0.5791,2.1438,0.3513,2.5574,3.7299,0.3729,1.8464,3.1399,0.8143,2.065,5.6156,0.0383,0.8666,2.2413,0.0013,2.3835,4.7161,2.3881,5.7196,1.3397,0.1643,0.8477,0.013,0.1948,1.8882,2.1688,0.2558,2.5412,0.0348,1.6401,2.9701,5.8015,1.7862,4.2758,6.182,0.3091,3.5932,2.1635,1.8604,6.4095,0.7114,3.7049,0.8764,0.6951,0.0117,1.7648,5.0543,2.59,0.0708,8.6371,3.8654,0.2423,0.7331,0.0001,4.4655,0.6033,1.0856,1.157,0.0682,0.327,3.5417,0.2048,1.9311,3.9335,9.4984,4.9945,0.0363,4.8538,0.6651,0.992,1.6126,6.9831,2.7108,0.1551,0.1663,2.5026,2.0452,0.1552,3.8479,2.0212,4.4549,1.3115,8.6305,3.0673,3.7855,1.6948,6.0567,1.6302,5.6259,6.0334,0.6146,4.7121,6.2469,0.5747,1.4696,4.4055,1.0074,0.0001,1.9184,1.6694,4.3575,2.7815,4.3018,1.8971,4.1215,1.6378,1.8667,1.8848,2.2402,2.0221,0.2409,1.6953,2.6519,0.0687,2.8615,2.0714,0.8162,2.7239,5.5431,4.4002,0.0199,4.6029,7.6291,2.5985,0.7021,0.3095,0.1786,1.6968,0.0001,2.4017,5.312,0.0825,3.2339,4.1157,4.0053,3.8909,2.6354,0.0014,3.1318,3.1312,3.2891,6.318,11.5085,2.435,0.9539,2.8903,7.5346,0.0272,1.6801,0.7145,7.9381,0.4069,1.1704,8.9787,2.0927,0.8585,1.2925,0.0985,0.1151,1.5014,2.3574,0.0654,2.4096,2.6288,1.5855,4.9443,3.432,4.793,5.176,5.5807,1.3516,3.5952,4.795,1.1993,2.6767,5.9851,2.1438,0.0862,1.2327,0.3326,4.9835,2.4179,0.9595,0.0019,0.0135,0.2503,0.0319,0.0939,3.4008,2.0436,5.3867,0.8323,5.0134,0.782,0.0005,0.084,2.6098,4.3275,9.9226,4.1839,8.0427,4.2684,1.1645,4.5449,2.5484,0.7402,4.1344,2.5755,3.7832,4.6113,1.7208,1.7037,3.9097,0.6913,0.0384,0.132]}

{"id":2409,"ended":false,"length":289,"text":"Bates placed importance on mental images, as he felt relaxation was the key to clarity of imagination as well as of actual sight. He claimed that one's poise could be gauged by the ease with which the mind was capable of recalling what he had seen just before. He would often repeat to his students,'See a subject as an image in your mind, and let it speak through you. But let it be true for you, otherwise it is lost '. An important factor for understanding the nature of visions and visions themselves was, in his view, the distinction between what one knows, and what one sees. In his later work, Imagination, he wrote, 'The only way of attaining a true conception of anything is that by which the object has become the substance of the mental conception ; as to this process of making mental images in the mind of the senses \u2014 that is the art of Imagination '. And yet in his earlier work, Imagination and Reality, he is more sceptical:'It takes years of study to become a good draughtsman. Imagination is an unknown quantity that can only give a false idea of things, or give them only their true forms. We must not give our imagination the idea of the truth, as it is not capable of making a just idea. The imagination is apt to make many things which are true appear to us less true than they really are. Our imagination is the worst enemy to clear conceptions'.

If it rains again, the drivers will have to take their pit stop on a rain lap.","token_len":300,"entropy":[9.7938,6.3579,2.4336,1.1024,5.3411,3.0552,7.6491,9.2854,8.7277,5.8792,0.0495,3.2202,9.8701,3.2942,5.7948,4.4685,2.8409,1.6565,5.2602,12.2659,5.7142,8.1906,5.0069,7.506,9.7074,2.9416,1.3864,8.5583,5.4309,8.0627,4.1645,4.3325,2.5263,0.8814,10.1213,4.5626,2.1949,0.0096,5.9311,1.6728,8.4909,2.1092,6.1528,2.3557,1.1668,1.7409,3.4641,0.8799,3.739,6.7164,2.891,5.2845,8.5209,2.4948,5.1412,5.307,1.7714,4.1093,2.7723,5.3619,6.0093,4.7309,6.8797,2.5459,5.2825,5.6791,9.3633,2.9595,1.2879,5.0345,3.3348,7.245,5.8652,0.9479,0.821,1.7244,9.3144,0.0005,6.2554,6.0661,5.1971,7.5155,5.3492,8.5652,6.8535,2.2314,3.8395,1.6092,0.2427,2.2756,0.1247,0.1468,1.9097,4.322,6.7616,1.7567,0.4382,4.3525,3.2343,1.083,2.8647,0.1983,0.0019,0.0018,3.6245,9.7125,0.0317,0.0638,0.004,0.0,0.7429,4.6525,0.1095,0.0013,3.4387,4.2466,3.3855,4.9728,3.2605,6.3388,3.0806,0.3493,3.8305,6.3919,0.9999,0.1216,9.0911,3.5619,0.048,0.002,2.2284,2.7581,6.5853,1.3702,0.0008,3.4148,2.0686,7.8906,8.6236,3.8842,1.5658,5.9941,0.0843,3.2294,6.3534,7.8443,0.041,1.8271,6.2503,0.0012,0.0186,0.0006,2.0869,1.0853,1.6576,4.77,1.4145,5.4258,2.2776,1.0391,0.893,8.3816,4.3688,4.2268,6.0533,1.1605,3.5083,1.9458,0.3682,0.4706,0.0479,0.049,0.6183,1.4086,0.0003,4.4932,4.0312,0.3545,9.6719,0.533,0.0004,0.678,0.3099,0.0828,0.6657,0.5577,7.4333,1.3027,4.3913,3.1421,4.329,0.5007,4.1676,5.5351,5.0376,2.1043,0.1404,1.8725,1.0229,1.3783,3.9846,4.4514,2.6548,4.4058,1.5973,4.6738,2.1748,2.1498,1.8049,3.1878,1.3787,5.4187,3.1614,0.8978,1.665,4.9673,1.969,5.585,1.3648,2.8432,5.855,2.2658,4.1518,3.9775,1.0471,5.8315,3.496,1.6682,5.1909,1.7167,1.678,2.1116,6.2619,3.5252,8.7569,4.8796,1.5122,0.7391,0.6219,0.3899,1.4637,0.2495,3.463,2.2472,0.2861,2.9054,0.2292,0.4099,1.4281,3.239,1.0677,1.6994,7.0053,3.8358,3.6262,2.1735,3.5153,7.9014,3.5509,5.3073,4.9314,0.9518,1.6635,2.7545,5.9242,0.1139,1.2524,6.1474,3.5303,1.1784,2.9043,1.4109,1.132,0.627,0.9994,2.5337,3.4253,1.0478,6.3199,1.2145,5.3758,3.9663,4.6715,3.6507,1.0846,0.8439,2.3816,0.4323,1.3759,0.3237,3.5568,2.2654,6.2742,2.6886,3.5567,3.2156,6.3512,5.6201,0.9744]}

In Final Fantasy Tactics, she appears as a flower girl ; when a group of criminals harasses her, the main character, a SOLDIER, arrives and she falls in love with him, saving the day at the last minute. However, due to an internal conflict, she cannot accept SOLDIER as a \"hero\" and later betrays her new boyfriend and the group; the group is forced to leave town after their identities are revealed. In Final Fantasy XII, Aerith appears as a summon-user, a female summoner who uses multiple summons. She can summon a dog, two spiders, a zombie and an airship, all of which are useful in battle; she has a special relationship with the summons. Aerith does not have an actual name; in other words, she is a \"persona\" with the name \"Aerith\", who has also appeared in various Japanese PlayStation titles as a character and is known in most areas as both a protagonist and a character due to her central role. She has appeared in other Final Fantasy games with unique appearances. She is a playable character in Final Fantasy XIII, where she is a major plot point and is able to summon her summons without the support of a party member; the summons, named \"Ragnarok\" in the original Japanese and \"Bismarck\" in the North American version, do almost all of her damage in battle.","token_len":300,"entropy":[7.8449,7.3974,3.9462,6.8621,3.1113,5.4685,0.5754,2.1312,3.7659,8.2304,0.1076,1.7723,4.9833,0.0058,5.2889,5.312,0.9654,2.5325,2.9971,0.0022,3.6489,0.6579,1.6291,2.5378,1.0602,0.7188,7.3133,4.8286,11.5897,5.2226,3.9834,3.3626,0.1217,7.9572,7.5461,7.8618,1.4241,0.7646,3.6894,6.0466,0.4863,4.2311,4.1296,10.0424,0.0161,0.9084,5.44,1.418,5.1384,5.1576,1.1821,0.0888,0.0575,0.493,2.0422,4.6739,2.1823,1.7797,5.8766,0.5087,3.8274,0.364,0.216,4.0485,0.0497,4.1275,0.0015,3.6669,4.6329,1.3764,1.1266,0.9361,4.3963,4.0128,9.0068,0.0694,2.8272,1.522,4.9348,4.2407,0.9854,1.0734,5.5643,8.6853,0.0051,1.1866,6.6069,3.2438,2.7197,3.718,2.6725,5.5159,3.0761,3.4681,2.2338,2.24,0.0431,2.0136,6.2043,2.5348,4.2974,9.8241,0.1663,0.4342,0.6652,2.0091,1.1832,0.0038,3.8787,0.5811,1.8958,0.0009,2.2923,0.4968,0.4585,8.5401,5.2759,4.8812,1.5669,2.7739,4.5763,2.6149,0.5689,1.665,3.5328,6.21,4.4939,2.2239,1.731,2.5914,2.1706,3.0371,7.5127,1.4739,5.9042,6.0272,0.3031,1.1648,6.4962,1.3107,2.6493,4.3989,1.5447,1.6375,3.4484,1.036,0.058,1.6618,4.8939,1.3103,1.8355,3.9187,1.4517,3.3017,1.6215,3.0593,7.6505,0.0235,1.6111,8.7848,1.5828,2.9085,0.0035,4.7074,0.1457,1.9257,2.5949,3.2917,2.7685,3.3859,2.6341,3.6542,1.8122,0.0369,0.4063,0.8816,1.7898,3.5721,5.5593,4.438,1.6101,3.5883,2.6936,1.5709,1.0714,2.5035,0.2076,0.0296,2.7794,4.8501,2.9303,5.267,0.9035,0.234,3.6263,5.9644,8.1102,3.1563,4.0446,1.5027,2.5703,3.9233,4.169,3.5827,3.1243,5.8699,5.363,1.0274,6.7793,1.035,5.5126,0.0747,1.1653,2.0658,7.8307,0.0102,0.3633,8.9639,0.4823,1.9956,2.3064,2.2092,2.6515,0.366,4.259,1.7634,0.0169,0.5786,4.4147,6.3769,3.6696,1.9891,2.3527,1.0304,2.4686,1.5465,0.2525,0.5,1.5861,0.004,2.3413,1.2739,3.1213,0.2482,1.076,2.1001,7.146,4.2346,0.437,2.1528,2.7046,4.8439,0.0141,2.4575,3.583,4.9768,4.7512,2.131,5.8835,0.0709,1.7331,2.3373,0.5586,3.64,3.0896,4.0826,4.2874,5.2701,1.4566,3.8944,4.8206,0.5334,1.7372,3.6625,1.5119,3.8378,2.2172,3.0152,0.2506,3.9167,6.8612,1.0048,0.0004,0.2034,0.1523,0.395,5.5026,0.0193,1.298,0.3135,3.8194,9.2201,3.6991,0.3149,1.3722,2.7106,2.247,1.8049,0.7332]}

{"id":544,"ended":true,"length":267,"text":"Early on April 30 a special train from Fort Macleod arrived with police officers and doctors. Premier Frederick Haultain arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had been flown in from Montreal. The first phase of the rescue work was hampered by the fact the river water was still very high while a second phase was cut short by bad weather.\n\nA second flood occurred on June 6, which was much worse due to the heavy melt running down the mountains. Fort McKay, Mackay and Swan Hills were cut off, and water levels swelled into Slave Lake, threatening to drown the town of Slave Lake.\n\nThe railway bridge spanning the Athabasca River broke in two and had to be replaced. The Canadian Pacific Railway also suffered serious damage to its track as its locomotives and bridges flooded. The Canadian Government offered relief and money to rebuild the railway. Most of the flood waters receded by early summer, allowing residents to return and many businesses to re-open.\n\nDespite the flood damage, Fort Macleod prospered in the 1860s and 1870s, attracting gold miners with its plentiful supplies of lumber, peat and wood tar for making paint and paper. The town experienced a population boom, with its population reaching about 5,000. However, the boom ended when railroads were built as well as more efficient transportation methods. By the 1960s Fort Macleod was a small village of under 1,000 people.","token_len":301,"entropy":[4.6741,5.1941,3.5466,5.991,4.6287,7.0003,2.576,6.8996,5.4645,1.5908,0.0308,2.8678,4.4709,7.4308,2.3655,1.8584,7.8193,1.7241,11.0969,10.2812,3.6891,8.8599,8.9915,6.6567,1.6126,0.7121,8.7436,0.5996,1.6158,1.1597,2.0847,1.8986,4.2107,0.8311,3.1071,0.4689,7.6399,2.9236,2.0524,1.6717,7.3944,0.8035,0.7233,4.9058,0.8846,2.2828,3.7438,4.7457,0.1013,0.5027,5.3118,4.083,1.5312,7.2341,0.1131,1.5032,2.2716,3.5716,5.9138,4.8768,1.054,2.8294,3.3153,4.1064,6.4524,4.0166,3.8668,1.2054,1.4411,7.313,2.6959,1.0912,5.481,0.185,0.4555,1.451,0.0039,3.5764,3.3471,5.9006,4.3662,0.7833,1.5673,2.7303,0.9235,2.5303,2.4754,4.8308,1.8773,5.1386,0.0192,1.1154,3.5011,10.1989,10.6657,0.8991,0.5632,5.2917,1.3953,7.4081,8.2619,2.4768,6.886,1.6669,0.8773,8.3251,8.3054,1.0685,5.8342,0.1062,3.3711,1.5232,4.4187,2.7446,6.0218,0.0758,4.2825,17.3527,0.4493,1.858,5.8279,0.8552,3.3419,1.7638,3.4016,2.8202,4.0646,0.1416,0.5786,1.7154,0.0002,1.5781,6.521,4.3894,6.263,0.7658,6.6711,0.1273,0.0043,0.1767,5.1385,2.2065,1.2337,1.8297,4.8178,0.2832,0.0423,2.5386,1.0698,1.3902,5.9212,4.2012,0.1003,3.8797,3.2939,3.891,0.7383,1.9712,0.6442,3.9676,3.3554,4.6955,4.6996,0.6238,0.0,2.5143,5.2285,5.0895,0.7769,1.6438,4.591,6.4052,4.8051,5.523,3.2858,3.3064,0.728,4.2238,0.4027,1.7643,2.1143,6.0954,0.4696,0.1933,6.1666,3.9781,5.9494,0.0577,3.5443,3.7556,3.378,0.932,5.3432,5.8239,0.4215,2.375,4.3398,6.285,4.9622,1.0589,5.6828,0.1467,0.6483,0.3361,0.6706,0.0002,5.0276,0.7177,3.6014,2.3669,0.5046,3.0405,2.7794,0.0034,0.0044,11.5671,0.0323,0.0002,2.8986,1.273,9.6397,0.0704,1.2135,1.9089,0.0012,1.7298,4.2391,7.702,1.349,4.9698,1.9308,5.4231,4.3416,0.3047,3.3413,1.4988,7.5045,0.4738,0.5643,3.9534,7.959,5.1348,4.286,7.8433,1.4295,4.4335,0.3073,1.6835,2.1861,4.8142,1.2655,3.651,1.4573,2.3295,1.8899,4.286,2.3214,3.9319,3.0096,3.882,0.1361,0.1718,2.1376,4.7415,0.119,1.3175,5.3867,3.1897,1.8144,6.4885,0.877,1.3922,3.5939,4.6485,2.421,0.454,5.2967,3.5988,4.1162,3.9041,0.9906,3.7678,0.502,4.2027,0.0154,2.5386,0.2907,0.0011,0.0063,1.1205,2.1829,4.6732,4.1702,2.4191,7.635,3.0561,0.0085,0.3743,0.9272,1.3706]}

Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, which takes place on the Thames between Greenwich and Chelsea, attracted a much smaller audience than the company had expected.\n\nBees on the Boatdeck was probably first performed by the Gilbert and Sullivan Operatic Club at the King's Hall on 5 May 1936. The opening performance was performed not by the Gilbert and Sullivan Operatic Club, but by the company of the London Gilbert and Sullivan Players (later to be renamed the Gilbert and Sullivan Players ), and featured both men as lead characters. The play also contained several songs written by the composers themselves, including one titled \"The Mellow Sea\", which was to be their final song for G & S. The other song was \"We Go to Work Without A Song \", which was to be sung for the first time by the company's lyricists, Henry and Adele Burrows, who both died that year.\n\nThe show featured a new orchestral score by W. S. Gilbert and J. B. Priestley for only their second score to be written for G & S. It was the second of a trilogy of plays in which Priestley collaborated with them, the first being The Merry Wives of Windsor, and the third their last play as composers. The final score for G&S was that of The Pirates of Penzance.","token_len":302,"entropy":[7.7673,9.0628,14.557,4.5851,10.4892,6.3036,6.3533,3.4746,1.5112,0.1832,2.0357,3.6871,6.3332,2.4608,4.9781,0.9245,4.3491,0.0913,6.8086,1.205,1.8004,14.866,5.402,0.8232,7.7079,15.9963,1.3209,5.2182,3.4038,5.9683,8.2541,7.9991,2.9905,2.5444,2.1825,5.1358,3.5285,1.061,6.6429,0.0884,2.1098,0.8605,4.9454,3.446,5.5795,0.1513,5.2644,0.2425,4.9403,1.9043,3.6725,2.3139,0.419,1.2471,1.5155,7.6674,1.7452,2.281,0.2209,1.7517,0.0061,4.1193,0.3354,0.2475,0.0049,0.0382,0.027,1.3154,5.9916,5.4637,3.1426,1.8076,2.4908,7.8347,2.0639,0.7708,10.3545,7.6317,4.0907,2.5454,1.3175,7.4089,0.2646,5.2054,2.6699,4.5056,2.0278,0.9108,0.6608,1.5382,5.6213,2.9363,0.7825,3.502,7.2693,1.169,1.2357,1.6807,0.2346,0.0024,0.9561,0.176,0.0278,1.1068,0.0481,0.1566,1.3063,5.2474,3.1661,2.2442,3.358,7.7555,0.2736,0.0099,7.5551,3.7837,3.2905,2.7248,0.4979,2.9464,0.6206,2.5467,0.2033,0.0279,1.3919,8.1004,2.8902,5.7607,4.5453,2.872,2.2149,5.4599,2.3488,0.538,1.3468,1.2527,3.9155,4.5033,3.076,4.7723,3.4952,0.2797,1.7851,7.5229,0.0013,4.7399,0.9414,1.3284,3.0891,4.7505,0.4665,2.0371,6.061,5.3708,5.4589,2.0969,1.2714,1.0323,5.7911,0.5675,7.7873,2.7669,1.7782,3.1452,8.6185,8.5986,3.4127,1.1153,1.9611,5.8407,0.845,1.0759,1.2649,5.061,4.6132,2.2844,5.0579,5.7256,4.0054,5.0865,6.4082,0.9923,0.7444,1.6231,0.3299,3.604,4.086,0.9813,1.9632,0.0725,1.2039,1.2272,4.0054,2.7488,6.1729,0.5826,1.5269,5.3143,2.4457,7.0459,2.6481,7.4819,1.9766,1.8784,2.1041,4.7014,3.4978,6.1315,0.7874,0.2519,0.9344,0.0001,1.4361,4.8919,4.5079,1.6977,4.1327,6.9247,0.0785,0.0,2.1557,1.0916,5.8354,0.2892,3.707,0.104,5.502,0.9912,3.2679,0.0189,0.2326,0.0021,0.0083,0.002,4.3119,8.1928,6.0966,1.0549,6.3951,3.9902,0.908,2.9286,1.7642,4.5812,0.2703,0.0067,0.5285,2.6949,0.62,3.1464,3.1327,2.6279,2.4612,3.4308,0.6847,2.327,3.7866,0.8284,6.1532,0.0073,5.9131,0.163,6.1458,1.8878,2.8142,0.4008,1.1999,2.6277,5.3921,2.5026,0.1334,0.4977,2.7914,1.73,3.0586,0.2676,3.6327,9.422,3.9579,2.8458,5.2573,7.5818,0.0108,0.681,1.4161,5.0714,1.9264,2.2518,1.7608,2.965,0.0142,0.6384,6.2526,0.3003,4.7005,7.6141,0.439,5.1143,0.7361,0.003,1.9671]}

When NY 94 was extended eastward to the village of Shandaken, NY 44 was cancelled as being a toll road.","token_len":302,"entropy":[9.788,11.8629,4.6723,5.0968,8.5876,2.1543,9.0731,8.9857,4.1718,11.0371,3.6116,5.3747,2.2945,2.2983,10.0767,0.3446,0.2878,4.835,2.8144,2.6246,11.3018,8.8874,2.1401,4.7403,2.4341,12.9899,7.3426,7.695,5.9539,4.4531,1.4077,2.7161,0.24,1.3333,5.9802,2.9164,4.2308,0.8627,1.417,3.5116,0.947,5.7293,0.642,1.5348,8.0327,0.1401,0.1892,2.5045,1.2996,5.1505,2.0402,1.4646,6.862,2.5832,0.4017,2.3235,5.5448,3.637,4.5109,3.7637,0.5796,5.0196,0.7894,1.3519,0.6319,10.7314,4.0402,8.6074,5.7553,0.1378,0.0102,0.7494,1.519,4.1299,0.7535,0.0062,4.3474,3.5909,1.8439,0.3419,4.0287,1.9855,0.252,3.9834,0.1458,0.0037,0.0001,0.2688,2.8795,1.09,5.6722,0.0439,8.1595,8.6977,4.2854,2.1783,1.7202,5.9961,3.0573,0.7786,2.3202,2.8074,1.0117,2.0956,1.0291,5.0531,6.4782,0.017,3.2381,4.0936,6.9447,2.6083,1.5279,5.6043,2.2877,0.1084,5.3092,6.8995,4.6052,4.6586,1.2646,2.4619,5.7449,6.1795,1.4997,4.0822,0.1088,0.3739,1.3189,3.8662,1.4216,6.229,0.0718,3.5759,0.0024,0.0021,3.1462,1.4809,2.9476,0.0054,3.6299,6.3229,5.8327,1.1038,1.2086,0.0537,6.5252,0.0263,1.2024,4.8488,0.0176,1.5729,1.9412,0.117,1.8973,4.8142,5.7583,1.3734,4.6878,0.0018,0.8929,7.2753,4.8773,7.1229,1.746,2.7821,4.3415,1.5929,9.8567,0.2592,6.0065,0.001,0.003,1.6744,4.4454,0.0047,0.1067,5.1849,0.5269,1.1619,8.1387,2.8616,0.573,6.4818,0.2148,4.4616,4.077,1.1873,4.5499,3.5253,1.7083,4.0164,4.8108,2.3042,3.8115,4.5482,3.6847,2.6018,1.7428,5.033,2.8808,5.8728,4.7374,0.9212,7.9451,6.5853,2.8811,6.0702,2.2098,0.4967,2.5929,5.5888,2.8972,0.0525,0.9999,2.7234,0.7833,1.2284,0.0002,3.9041,3.4217,1.5367,6.099,6.8565,3.2055,4.0682,2.1138,1.8393,5.4096,2.7857,3.4695,5.2483,0.7047,4.2156,8.0062,1.5687,1.923,1.503,5.2041,0.0144,6.5298,4.4962,11.1608,2.6249,6.4944,0.0678,2.6208,3.7192,4.4536,0.2644,0.5758,3.5041,3.4523,1.6099,5.4175,0.4927,1.7505,1.6406,0.0002,2.9549,1.1004,8.0714,0.9415,3.0388,5.1776,2.0962,2.1469,2.764,1.2802,12.2726,0.0504,3.2768,5.7691,0.8594,2.8072,0.7355,5.0962,1.5718,2.4783,0.1855,0.8688,2.6943,0.8929,0.6412,1.119,1.3129,0.0084,1.0635,0.004,0.0016,1.5606,1.3811,1.0648,0.5793,7.7457,2.9033,4.8508,2.1061,0.5793,0.0799,0.8813]}

The organizing committee advised participants about the correct alignment of the triad on the flags. The first official display of a triad flag in the world took place at the National Assembly of Poland a year later, on May 4, 1917.\n\nA triad is an arrangement of flags on top of a podium, pole or tower with three equal vertical stripes.[1] A triad is also a type of color symbol, used for expressing the tri-coloration principle and the spirit of independence of Poland.\n\nContents\n\nThe tricolor symbol of the Polish nation had long been part of the national flag since May 9, 1914, but only as a small corner to the flag. The Polish national flag has six equal equal-size stripes, the upper parts represent a white sky and the lower parts represent black earth.\n\nDuring the First World War and World War II in Poland, both the red and white were often replaced by black. The colors black and red were also sometimes used with red and blue stripes respectively, or black and yellow stripes.[2]\n\nIn 1914, Polish and German military commanders decided that the Poles should be taught that one flag design included only the upper parts of the Polish national flag, leaving the lower halves of their country's flag. That was the first use of the \"red, white and black\" triad.[3]","token_len":302,"entropy":[8.5303,7.1844,5.3714,6.4365,1.0975,2.6658,1.0069,9.1291,5.5575,5.3064,7.0682,6.6989,5.2413,2.2893,8.5294,3.6063,2.4846,3.6013,3.4211,0.9316,6.95,2.421,6.1478,1.1889,2.2753,11.1701,1.9916,6.6302,5.0305,6.5128,0.8738,7.9929,8.497,0.29,0.9492,8.9261,1.782,3.969,1.4883,6.446,1.5863,1.9871,4.3188,4.5276,5.1867,0.8671,3.3043,2.7959,0.0408,4.4655,3.051,1.4105,4.0317,3.297,0.0025,2.0189,0.7944,3.7499,2.9966,1.8397,0.9875,6.8187,2.6342,0.302,1.9391,1.644,1.1035,2.3313,0.4273,1.6411,0.3713,1.856,0.0096,4.0433,3.9497,0.0513,2.3474,2.56,3.5204,0.3904,3.1474,3.7331,4.5587,0.0266,1.6525,8.0223,1.8413,8.985,1.1511,6.2129,3.2936,4.1741,5.1949,6.1858,0.9915,8.6428,1.6963,0.0992,2.6233,0.5568,0.0131,1.2399,3.1702,1.7517,4.4601,0.0253,7.6791,4.8325,1.9981,3.5461,2.1685,6.6253,2.2915,5.9181,6.7582,4.6601,2.8312,7.3514,2.937,2.4557,6.7616,0.1401,4.8265,1.8711,2.5609,0.8247,1.4445,0.0002,5.7094,3.4108,0.0002,2.4413,6.3443,0.1291,0.0818,3.6855,3.1203,0.7369,2.2684,3.125,6.8815,4.3789,0.1737,4.4287,0.0034,0.7851,1.5534,1.0241,4.6548,6.7496,4.1788,0.0801,3.0779,1.1442,3.2062,4.2119,4.1888,0.4894,5.526,7.6971,4.4885,1.2014,3.5201,2.7593,1.4658,4.5846,2.1868,0.3127,3.3223,5.7931,5.0298,6.5795,3.472,3.3606,1.2266,1.3352,3.2635,5.2845,8.0466,6.6417,3.6006,3.8243,6.8582,1.5147,0.2153,0.1178,1.8766,0.5458,3.8394,4.8294,0.5144,1.7841,0.0002,4.7076,0.7316,3.3605,0.0299,0.0009,4.1392,3.0483,0.0147,0.1702,5.7793,2.2982,0.2769,4.8404,1.2989,3.1867,0.1564,0.9855,4.6416,4.7391,5.2905,0.4754,2.7508,1.6816,1.4871,3.0924,5.9118,0.2849,1.93,0.9099,2.9908,3.9822,0.7895,4.0644,3.4854,1.5377,2.9029,4.7391,6.0574,1.7737,4.5537,4.3893,0.8938,3.3293,4.0063,3.9238,0.2464,0.0764,0.9675,0.0001,2.2656,3.8692,0.3655,3.9339,4.1442,2.0762,4.2269,2.714,2.9696,1.3221,1.0411,6.0345,0.9819,2.4804,6.1766,2.3956,5.5188,3.3678,6.8255,6.8517,3.5591,2.2227,4.7867,3.1071,0.4332,0.3905,6.1482,1.2273,0.1384,1.1845,5.6007,0.8666,1.2738,4.5766,1.6851,5.4061,4.2627,1.1468,0.8516,1.7756,5.6055,2.0069,1.4491,2.8414,4.9715,0.0569,0.8015,3.688,2.1204,3.189,0.3293,0.6139,2.8797,0.3894,4.6117,0.504,3.1591,0.155,0.0437]}

After quitting cocaine, he ended his habit of smoking six packs of cigarettes daily in 1988. In December 1988, he fell into a coma after contracting septicemia. Jennings stopped a month into his sentence, before the prison doctor allowed it, and he was released on bail. Jennings had stopped having his regular shots of antibiotics, and was now being treated with penicillin every 72 hours. Jennings' wife, Gloria, had stopped giving him his shots of penicillin in October, after hearing rumours that the prison was withholding vaccines because of the threat of an outbreak of hepatitis A. Jennings said that two prison officials had told him the rumours were true. The Department of Health issued a denial in March 1990. Jennings' lawyer said on his behalf to the Chicago Tribune : \"I can tell you unequivocally that Mr Jennings' condition has been deteriorating for a period of time due to his alcoholism and his chronic heart disease\".\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was contacted about Jennings' condition in 1990, but no corrective measures were taken. Jennings' family decided to release him from prison in February 1991, but he did not leave for several days. At the time, Jennings' lawyer said that Jennings had made a full recovery. Jennings' heart disease was diagnosed in 1976.

But Zhou comments that his `` old wife `` died and his `` small son `` was killed in battle. He then became angry and was about to destroy all of China, including the \" Golden City \" of Luoyang. One of the two main characters of the novel Yuan, the king of Zhou, was convinced that there was no chance for an uprising against the dynasty so he asked Zhou to stop. Zhou stopped for a while and then did nothing, but later again set out to destroy the country, this time because the officials of his province of Qi were stealing food from him. Yuan also told him to stop and said that the country should not be destroyed but that the royal family and the ministers must commit suicide. Zhou then asked him to stop telling stories to him because there was no good fate for them. Yuan was so furious that he sent soldiers to kill everyone in Zhou's household and burned the palace to the ground.\n\nZhou's mother tried to reason with Zhou but failed. Finally she found a secret path to the palace garden, where she gave Zhou poison to eat or drink. Zhou wanted to try to save his mother from the fire and he threw the poison into his food.

{"id":2084,"ended":true,"length":289,"text":"The lane is a restricted area in which players can stay for only a limited amount of time. On all levels, a team on the offensive ( in possession of the ball ) is allowed to occupy the offensive zone for a certain number of touches ( maximum of 2 per touch) and at the end, the player is allowed to pass back ( lateral out ).\n\nThis zone is marked by an infinitesimal line, placed every 4 feet on the court. The defense cannot occupy this zone for longer than 6 seconds and, in the event of a lateral out ( outside lane ), if the ball touches the line once, it is free to fall into the attacking side.\n\nSo the defender must keep on shifting from the offensive zone to the opposite side because the defense is free only on the line to prevent lateral out : the zone in front of the defenders ( defensive zone) can be occupied by a defender during the period that the attacking team remains in the zone.\n\nA lateral out is any shot in or outside of the lane which touches the ground more than 6 inches during the stroke. It is also a violation if the offensive team intentionally touches the ground outside of the free throw line during and after the shot.\n\nLateral out : When\n\nA lateral out ( lateral movement ) is any shot, layup or dunk where the player makes no attempt to make their body horizontal as they rise. The player's back is slightly arched and their head is facing towards the basket.","token_len":302,"entropy":[10.3484,2.1261,3.2991,7.6324,0.8326,3.3841,1.9043,5.9456,0.8108,5.9973,3.0304,5.8225,1.2693,1.8953,1.1849,0.0268,0.029,0.7721,5.0588,6.1054,5.3519,0.5006,3.4489,5.3336,5.9603,0.8755,5.7394,6.115,10.5378,9.0043,0.4664,0.9799,2.6802,1.4129,2.3755,1.7361,0.4288,4.4023,0.611,7.2153,2.8255,1.8331,1.7117,3.1658,2.071,0.0081,7.4324,2.4809,7.9773,1.0733,3.1564,3.2441,4.2873,4.2948,1.4387,4.8264,0.9674,1.3288,5.0116,1.3601,2.7857,2.283,1.5801,0.2296,3.8437,5.0455,3.8454,9.1469,6.7814,2.8984,1.4393,0.0483,4.3521,3.9645,0.9467,5.138,0.7891,2.8439,5.6706,2.452,0.083,0.6255,4.0016,2.5316,6.9842,7.1825,3.0464,3.2786,3.0219,0.5954,4.7367,1.0526,1.5698,7.0205,4.5875,3.3381,2.392,2.036,1.7245,3.2059,0.0319,3.5541,1.1171,2.8196,3.9006,2.3282,1.6308,1.4915,0.6576,0.6557,6.7203,0.4329,3.4154,6.8663,4.5188,0.931,5.4922,0.7336,2.5448,3.8309,0.265,2.6733,6.7502,0.7316,1.5418,1.2122,6.7337,0.2621,5.0928,2.5024,0.2226,6.2301,5.4054,1.3258,0.8601,0.0003,6.546,3.1017,4.5168,2.5662,4.142,4.1505,7.7637,3.4234,1.7376,1.7544,0.6013,0.7522,0.2047,6.8604,0.4814,6.22,1.4808,3.5892,1.9641,4.5617,8.8409,4.9807,1.1077,4.8131,4.1741,4.2896,3.1891,0.2792,5.8852,2.4936,5.3626,5.263,2.6624,0.2452,0.3954,6.3967,4.2382,4.9641,1.4879,3.9222,3.2545,0.9438,1.3931,1.4322,2.3158,4.2063,5.9868,0.9771,3.6752,3.9698,0.7712,5.7551,0.5622,6.4327,1.3657,1.0818,2.7069,0.6839,0.5321,0.0004,3.6561,4.6342,0.3542,1.2269,5.0743,6.0579,3.433,4.4921,2.908,0.9575,0.3689,2.8277,2.9616,4.4994,0.3283,7.0981,6.5729,0.0707,2.5224,2.5549,6.285,0.5851,9.36,2.1242,2.5518,0.7739,3.0154,2.0049,6.1517,3.7026,0.4325,3.7322,1.2507,6.0909,3.0033,0.2121,1.1623,4.3293,0.9463,0.1285,6.9426,2.3438,0.1164,2.9064,7.4609,0.531,0.3384,3.2068,0.9417,0.5238,0.0003,5.3417,0.4999,0.4005,5.2441,4.8267,8.2727,0.0003,2.1719,0.3016,0.175,3.6359,2.6816,7.4951,0.8936,0.7576,3.5338,0.831,4.2767,6.8634,0.9779,1.0286,3.7562,5.4539,0.413,2.4333,4.2079,3.3125,0.7804,0.1589,3.0653,7.7469,5.3271,8.2976,4.4975,2.1107,7.7808,2.8355,2.3822,2.5216,3.3479,5.484,1.1211,5.6083,6.7199,0.0391,1.8534,2.5843,2.4286,0.6842,3.1408,3.8907,0.0906,2.181,0.6904]}

{"id":644,"ended":false,"length":279,"text":"Kilmer's poetry was influenced by `` his strong religious faith and dedication to the natural beauty of the world. `` Although several communities across the United States claim to have inspired `` Trees,`` Kilmer identified the forest itself as the source of a much stronger sense of being, the `` source `` of his poetry. ``Trees \u00bb is richly suggestive, with strong emotional appeal through the imagery and imagery used to establish mood.\n\nOne day the trees told you a secret. And from their stories, you knew that nothing mattered in the whole vast universe. They told you to stay home, and watch the flames play on the water, and sleep in the cool comfort of your own bed. They told you that life was short, but there were so very many things to do before you left to never come back.

{"id":4524,"ended":true,"length":278,"text":"Relying on money donated by neighbors, Du Bois attended Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1885 to 1888. His travel to and residency in the South, coupled with his experience working as a custodian, helped him achieve a comprehensive and inter-temporal perspective on the history of southern race relations. Du Bois then enrolled in the Harvard University School of Social Work ( now part of the Harvard School of Public Health ) in 1889. He completed his training at Harvard for three years and returned to Nashville, where he began teaching at Fisk in 1895. Du Bois and five of his students later opened a free mental hygiene clinic in Memphis. Following his return to the Midwest, Du Bois taught at Chicago's Lane Technical Institute and was a field worker for the American Association for the Study of Negro Life and History at the age of 46.\n\nDu Bois became a professor at the University of Chicago, where he established the department of Afro-American and African studies in 1902, and became a member of the school's board of trustees.

The lyrical content of \"No World Order\" includes strong anti-religious sentiments and a heavy mention of global warming, although the lyrics to other songs on the album have also been praised.","token_len":303,"entropy":[2.3257,11.1946,3.0839,5.8856,3.4304,15.489,4.266,4.0201,7.8131,7.5043,8.946,3.7441,0.885,1.4721,4.721,4.0215,6.3105,3.9101,8.0068,0.7438,8.4483,8.2901,0.4854,0.8062,2.7711,0.2005,6.6651,2.9979,5.675,16.9007,6.9565,5.4985,7.5377,1.9025,2.2291,0.5299,5.31,3.3177,0.8059,3.8381,0.7644,5.0974,2.9647,1.1058,5.6158,4.2052,6.0215,3.0044,0.8991,0.8514,4.2427,1.5302,0.4561,0.4674,0.1318,0.8888,3.3921,4.0606,0.6233,6.9368,2.2252,4.737,3.0757,2.4157,4.7654,4.8529,6.6644,5.6645,1.1227,7.5108,4.5344,1.4855,0.7328,0.5106,4.1206,7.7218,1.1235,0.2086,0.132,0.2983,2.4277,4.2998,1.0053,5.0555,6.1639,6.1323,0.2622,2.6313,1.1376,5.112,0.3662,1.5139,5.4837,3.448,3.285,0.9206,1.6228,4.8743,0.5818,0.6968,6.6156,4.8355,5.8124,1.656,2.4661,1.6415,5.8702,0.3749,2.3458,0.496,0.0923,0.3042,1.681,3.2568,1.6479,0.0159,0.1168,5.8974,1.7835,1.5529,5.4169,2.1637,3.1443,4.1688,0.0007,4.5513,7.66,0.2698,1.5223,8.1643,3.1069,0.1448,1.1135,3.289,1.5692,0.1141,1.3226,0.0214,0.0681,1.1821,6.4052,1.3684,0.9896,0.2062,0.0838,1.1485,3.5142,0.5047,5.2046,5.5009,3.64,2.2698,1.0059,1.0062,0.0982,0.103,0.7439,5.0901,3.3794,0.147,1.3869,0.0087,0.0426,3.7722,8.0613,0.1724,0.8748,0.0888,0.0378,0.3059,2.8611,1.1669,0.0006,4.173,1.9811,0.1442,6.5338,1.7323,1.8828,6.0116,3.5947,5.4226,1.6027,1.9961,0.0544,0.0023,5.3927,0.364,2.0188,0.159,0.0502,0.0112,0.0177,0.0068,0.0009,0.6896,0.58,0.2351,3.7658,4.9842,6.4756,0.6956,0.2448,0.6848,1.5458,0.4093,2.7904,5.4804,2.9464,0.6683,1.8624,2.6427,0.409,6.9261,2.8376,1.3536,5.7579,0.1434,4.3323,1.5572,2.9462,3.8683,3.68,7.0112,0.8997,0.8014,4.3667,4.4834,0.0277,6.0653,1.4625,5.6367,1.8734,5.4852,2.2856,6.4394,2.5134,3.8935,5.7894,0.5959,3.5837,3.0214,1.3827,3.18,0.5487,2.6088,2.5191,1.3216,0.0244,0.0002,0.1005,1.7056,2.3915,0.4115,2.6926,0.3386,1.5186,0.0035,0.0461,4.7283,0.1248,2.8351,6.8093,1.4139,1.8675,6.1722,0.0145,2.0046,0.4579,1.4518,2.342,0.0023,0.0008,0.1303,6.2423,5.0074,5.4958,0.1628,5.1682,2.1286,1.5904,2.6465,3.8177,8.6808,0.0343,5.4062,0.8471,1.6731,3.7587,1.4454,1.6821,4.8994,6.1999,0.244,2.943,0.2619,0.0289,2.3979,1.6007,0.3071,2.3628,0.9008]}

Major street reconstruction did occur on these streets. One of the most significant occurred with the reconstruction of 21st St. and Dodge St. from Dodge to Stemmons. 20th St and Dodge became a two and four lane street. 20th St was improved from a two lane to a one lane street.

This project was part of the \"East-West Interchange\" of Dodge St. between 26th St. and 21st St.\n\nAlso in the 1950s and 1960s, in areas surrounding Omaha where large housing tracts were going up fast, Omaha began to extend its major thoroughfares east \/ west to these housing tracts, or had begun to extend them, as indicated on the map. By 1968 Omaha\u2019s streets have been completely redeveloped; however some existing streets still had some remaining remnants of what existed in the 1950s.\n\nHistoric City Map\n\nPlease click on the link below to download a PDF of the historic city map.","token_len":303,"entropy":[3.6078,7.4898,3.886,5.1381,6.0915,8.3016,4.0485,2.6869,5.2068,0.0114,1.4306,5.9035,2.9639,1.5391,5.7443,13.1883,0.2055,5.2209,0.5662,9.3013,16.377,7.4951,5.1263,5.5156,3.5213,1.1705,8.9322,5.7537,3.3743,1.1963,0.2047,0.7324,4.9924,0.0191,0.0001,4.032,10.7018,2.2621,1.0524,4.5729,1.9237,5.6579,1.969,0.6527,4.3948,1.3884,5.1126,2.0181,1.7526,5.1756,2.0796,4.7166,0.0725,0.7795,7.3872,0.0001,0.0002,0.5803,2.6043,1.6243,1.7523,0.0034,3.3656,1.9851,2.7499,0.6816,4.4047,1.4152,3.887,4.6165,4.5678,8.1569,0.1311,0.939,6.614,1.7123,1.3725,9.4867,0.5149,7.3071,5.1102,4.3429,6.5285,2.9576,3.6633,5.05,0.8587,2.0587,4.3727,0.9017,0.2126,1.6623,1.8936,6.273,4.7424,0.4718,4.6158,0.0679,8.886,0.1809,2.4704,0.5757,2.3572,8.9576,1.058,0.3831,4.6565,6.5215,1.9766,4.8306,5.3352,4.5214,1.7453,8.255,0.3938,0.4439,3.6692,1.4545,5.325,2.3171,5.3147,5.7533,4.7759,2.0046,0.7849,1.4049,5.0162,0.0781,0.4746,1.5084,6.6633,3.1659,1.4901,1.6929,0.1371,2.7955,0.4979,2.6217,0.0538,0.5332,0.9938,2.8396,6.8013,3.5735,5.3971,12.1205,1.0108,6.0439,1.447,4.173,3.1521,3.0662,6.1829,4.2274,7.0518,2.5651,4.2847,6.5657,2.2056,5.7412,4.1769,0.7233,5.0535,3.8881,5.7754,0.1202,0.3305,2.4902,4.3143,1.3628,4.3159,0.0036,0.9628,3.7704,5.587,3.9092,0.2619,4.3249,0.9844,0.8276,3.6674,8.7304,1.238,0.4894,3.7213,6.0406,0.0235,0.648,0.8272,0.074,4.2005,0.0036,0.0581,0.2704,2.0668,0.0003,6.2963,1.0127,1.1048,0.3554,0.0726,2.4291,0.276,0.023,1.4675,5.0692,5.1727,5.4844,3.4234,4.469,5.0273,6.5022,6.1169,0.8453,6.7078,1.5709,7.8572,0.5916,5.3274,4.0384,0.4144,7.3926,1.2941,4.4378,2.1808,0.0126,0.002,4.1724,6.9484,0.2818,2.1571,6.9219,8.8056,1.2603,3.1737,5.7978,6.3977,4.0808,0.2434,2.5589,2.6204,3.8503,2.7747,5.8907,3.5179,0.5173,0.771,1.7138,4.0192,4.4436,3.0951,18.0366,7.847,2.5977,3.649,5.7143,1.3253,5.095,4.1265,0.0021,5.8524,3.4722,4.869,5.3592,1.9784,3.3506,4.8683,3.3755,5.7356,5.7105,0.9287,4.4528,5.7411,1.5238,0.8084,0.8666,0.04,0.818,1.1265,0.0002,5.5872,0.6553,5.692,4.7655,1.2653,0.0003,5.9469,2.6667,0.8955,0.5347,4.0975,0.8684,0.3597,2.4573,1.0229,3.4546,0.8505,0.4422,2.0522,0.6991,0.2309,1.3839]}

These include simple analgesics ( such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen ) and opioids such as morphine.\n\nThe most commonly used analgesic is methocarbamol. Methocarbamol is an NSAID, which is a kind of pain relief drug that is prescribed for conditions such as arthritis, back pain, and joint pain. Although this drug can prevent the pain from getting worse, it doesn't relieve it completely.\n\nNSAIDs ( non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ) can help to decrease the pain and swelling of burns. There are many different kinds of NSAIDs available. These include aspirin ( like Bayer Aspirin ), ibuprofen and naproxen.\n\nNaproxen is usually prescribed for moderate to severe pain. Naproxen is known as AL-Naproxen. Although Naproxen relieves pain, it doesn't completely relieve the pain associated with burning and can cause nausea.\n\nAnother common NSAID is ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is given by mouth or in liquid form. Ibuprofen comes in tablet form and some over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain relievers.\n\nAnother common method of pain management is the administration of a cortisone cream as well as steroid ointments.

The test gave teams the opportunity to confirm the final details of the new rule changes.\n\nThe tests were focused on evaluating the 2018 Pirelli Tyre Package while using two different cars for each test. As the regulations restrict teams to running the current year tyre compounds on these new cars, teams had the challenge of not only developing the new rules for 2018, but also adapting to the current 2017 Pirelli Tyre Package and to the new aerodynamic regulations.\n\nThe three day tests were divided into two two day tests per day and the teams carried out 25 individual set ups per each test.\n\nWith the first two days as a tyre development test, the teams spent the first part of the test with tyre development focused exclusively on aerodynamic development. Due to the complexity of the new rules, the team focused on working on the technical and physical parameters of the new cars while carrying out their development tasks.\n\nIn the second test day the teams focused on tyre testing with a sole car working on a full car set up of tyre, a separate set up for the front and another separate set up for the rear.\n\nOn both days teams conducted simulations, analysis and dyno runs as well as data gathering.\n\nThe day three test focussed on a final development test at the same time teams were focusing on tyre and engine development.","token_len":304,"entropy":[4.0817,5.1847,3.0004,1.7957,1.7075,8.2033,9.9352,0.7407,4.5093,15.4935,8.1979,5.1453,7.7993,3.3835,2.9722,1.4472,5.7114,6.1184,0.0276,2.5898,1.415,1.4924,6.6807,0.0012,0.5962,6.8052,0.7699,0.0024,0.5991,2.1122,3.0411,6.0723,3.9357,1.9292,1.1338,0.0274,7.2833,2.0813,5.1658,4.5995,0.3339,1.0596,4.0222,5.5844,2.137,1.7027,0.6243,0.0003,1.4997,4.7701,1.4603,6.8086,0.129,6.6398,0.9364,9.014,6.2436,0.4834,0.0007,11.3034,2.3606,6.8555,5.6619,5.4893,4.9457,2.0485,4.2007,2.5118,1.8502,2.6462,0.6285,4.5659,2.0772,5.3999,7.3085,3.7559,0.9229,4.974,2.7528,5.5263,4.8716,4.7738,6.204,3.4415,6.1969,4.1179,2.3378,0.2662,2.3308,3.1777,2.4895,7.8157,0.0524,5.9198,1.1204,5.2131,1.3199,1.4664,3.9348,2.9693,1.304,1.2177,0.0303,0.2169,4.5635,2.0199,0.8768,4.1862,7.088,3.3494,0.0499,0.0052,3.7019,0.0186,0.6512,3.6153,4.0936,0.9843,1.2185,6.5548,0.1904,1.4109,0.864,0.3854,0.0001,1.4289,4.9657,5.6581,2.8987,1.5327,4.2017,0.0856,1.1158,4.4493,1.7745,1.6841,6.4163,1.3702,2.5006,2.3585,3.2036,5.4353,0.1402,7.1619,3.7725,7.2908,2.6407,4.2757,9.6172,1.2008,0.4694,2.0276,0.0001,4.9433,0.9955,3.5872,1.1899,0.9972,5.7889,1.92,9.5132,6.2696,0.2814,0.4178,0.9512,0.4925,4.5624,2.0652,2.0094,4.516,0.0227,0.2641,2.572,4.1617,4.4749,3.1133,7.7436,5.816,0.0279,3.9618,0.5426,3.5558,0.7218,6.8632,0.0037,0.6247,5.2655,0.2385,0.6287,2.4293,1.682,0.6189,1.1178,2.5375,4.5429,0.6766,5.5526,1.6261,1.5247,4.8759,3.7197,5.0014,5.3595,0.7319,0.5803,1.5184,2.9503,2.8043,7.4466,0.2316,3.8701,4.6102,4.7945,1.5081,0.6519,0.0001,2.9663,0.512,0.3965,2.6485,4.2592,2.4435,0.209,3.7804,0.3036,3.9024,4.5267,2.6341,2.5554,8.3616,3.837,5.7519,0.924,2.5308,5.4409,4.1278,4.3559,0.4152,5.2677,4.2273,4.8891,4.0901,5.3358,1.6721,0.7091,1.47,1.5551,5.0487,1.3262,8.7951,6.4548,0.1089,0.1134,0.0688,0.0817,0.1936,0.7418,1.2687,0.0001,3.9477,4.1612,1.4036,2.7823,3.6918,6.4124,3.6846,7.6168,0.5418,8.7756,0.0321,3.7966,4.2561,1.5556,0.0257,5.8089,4.3137,1.796,1.2841,0.0001,1.3076,6.8597,4.9497,1.5341,9.0569,0.0991,0.1912,3.7111,4.7535,6.1557,1.2137,3.1311,0.4555,5.0936,1.1148,10.2139,1.9197,4.9084,0.1115,3.0278,4.2001,5.8282,0.5956,0.7475]}

As of 2 pm on 11 August, a high wind warning was in effect for Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai. The storm, once a hurricane, then strengthened into an extratropical cyclone west-northwest of the island. By 8 am on 12 August, Honolulu's Kapali beach was transformed into a tropical rainstorm.\n\nRainfall on and around Oahu was measured at nearly 20 inches ( 500 mm ) on Hawaii island. A flash flood killed four on Hawaii island the night of 12 August and three more were killed on Hawaii island on 13 August. The combined death toll surpassed the three people killed on Kauai during Tropical Storm Olivia in 1999. On the Big Island, 2,500 homes were knocked off their foundations or destroyed, with losses totaling more than $150 million. In Kauai, the storm destroyed about 100 homes and also severely damaged an estimated 2,000.\n\nBy August 21, Hawaii had begun to see the first signs of recovery. The weather service estimated that Oahu had suffered $100 million to $300 million in damage. Recovery efforts were hampered by Hurricane Iselle which hit the islands on 2 September. In total six deaths were reported related to the storm.

Once inland, the depression quickly weakened, and the center of the circulation, while continuing to spin, drifted back along the coast, and quickly dissipated.\n\nThe depression did not cause any significant impacts due to the time it occurred and its weak strength.[1] However, it brought significant rainfall, reaching up to 3.88 inches (99 mm) in some areas.\n\nContents\n\nSynopsis\n\nA tropical depression formed over the western Caribbean Sea on August 22, 2010. The depression became better organized as it moved through the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea. Despite its tropical characteristics, the depression did not become a tropical storm until August 24. The hurricane center forecast the depression to intensify into a tropical storm, but further development was prevented due to the lack of available warm water in the western Caribbean Sea. The depression continued to track west-northwestward along the northwestern coast of Mexico with a strengthening flow aloft, before dissipating on August 25, some 60 miles (95 km) offshore Veracruz, Mexico.\n\nImpacts\n\nThe center of the depression brought heavy rainfall to Veracruz early on August 22, with isolated maximum amounts topping 3 inches (75 mm).

{"id":4581,"ended":true,"length":295,"text":"According to the British historian of science < unk > Lewis, the Diolkos represented a railway, in the basic sense of a prepared track which so guides the vehicles running on it that they have no need for a conductor. On the other hand, the Diolkos were, as we have seen, a kind of a guide that was also in charge of the safety of the vehicle through the guidance of any possible danger on the track. One can understand the difference between these two functions easily : on the one hand, the conductor is the one who knows the best where to put and to stop the vehicles and, on the other hand, one can rely on him only as a conductor < unk > if he knows how to use the vehicle. The track itself has not only a guidance function as to the vehicle to follow it but its position is also important : if the conductor does not guide the vehicle to the correct position, then the vehicle might well go off the track and end in the water ( and that would be very dangerous ). In that connection, the Diolkos were also a kind of an electric fence that could kill the vehicle that gets crossed by it or that touches it < unk > and, hence, the conductor was in charge of guiding the vehicle without ever crossing it ( which means that the conductor is, in a certain way as well, more than a conductor ). That is why we say that the Diolkos were actually two persons in charge of the vehicle on a railroad track.","token_len":304,"entropy":[1.9909,1.5,6.9296,7.0493,4.7574,3.7976,12.0012,11.263,5.1521,6.4853,8.0909,1.7306,1.6994,7.5592,8.9524,7.8651,7.347,1.4333,11.7793,3.6775,4.5557,2.3074,7.7617,1.0333,0.7399,1.943,11.7643,5.6084,3.5724,8.2579,9.4141,0.9122,6.3826,5.581,2.1733,1.0222,4.0155,0.8766,3.865,1.8779,1.9854,1.1168,1.9961,3.97,0.6195,4.9434,0.6327,0.5767,0.0344,0.1022,1.1954,1.3647,0.0625,0.0552,1.2822,3.8369,1.7734,3.4792,1.3542,0.4138,0.1337,2.5106,3.9546,0.0033,4.7337,6.6202,4.9684,2.7043,4.9169,4.4736,3.3852,0.0531,0.8739,6.2576,0.2628,0.4386,4.2799,4.9392,1.3911,8.7356,0.104,6.557,5.7186,3.9544,5.4739,0.4821,0.7126,0.3617,5.4822,2.7783,3.6924,1.4125,5.4828,0.4133,3.092,0.1971,5.8698,7.4117,9.0504,3.4823,0.7232,0.029,0.0133,0.489,1.0557,4.3042,1.4955,1.8358,2.388,0.5844,4.3579,1.4319,4.4816,7.5062,0.6964,2.6016,5.58,3.05,3.2995,1.482,2.0461,2.6161,2.9741,0.2324,0.0015,0.0023,0.1603,0.0309,5.4325,1.9906,5.1827,0.2915,3.1541,3.9965,3.3405,0.8917,3.1674,9.8512,1.8276,0.0431,0.0705,3.202,1.2365,2.9782,3.2403,0.1467,3.5961,0.9601,3.3074,1.4782,2.1878,7.1878,3.0062,3.5102,4.3902,2.2195,1.1596,6.3312,4.0231,4.0559,3.8391,1.8013,4.8233,4.9274,5.0667,3.2541,1.7692,5.1556,5.1764,2.5872,0.4808,4.5308,2.3782,3.0265,0.9745,3.8893,3.1393,0.0471,6.8875,0.5505,0.6338,2.9583,1.7097,2.6726,2.2061,0.692,1.8201,1.4008,1.16,4.9895,5.5433,3.1258,2.3719,1.7556,0.1544,1.5596,3.6882,4.3813,1.916,6.9738,5.0566,6.186,4.1125,2.0607,0.916,3.8107,0.848,1.3226,2.8553,4.9585,6.4626,0.8421,1.061,0.9858,0.013,0.0106,1.7264,2.3409,2.3993,1.1923,0.0019,4.096,4.7137,6.0346,2.7064,2.3473,8.7519,1.7255,2.7046,4.281,7.9213,7.2077,1.839,2.0909,4.2191,2.5375,6.4141,0.4586,7.0892,0.1726,0.0024,0.0345,2.0971,3.1717,4.8065,0.0941,1.8297,5.8535,1.4836,3.6979,0.0951,0.1252,5.7901,0.3914,0.7259,5.5495,4.8812,4.4762,1.4711,3.3706,5.0245,3.1667,0.6144,1.3341,3.0784,3.1156,4.8659,1.3116,3.5099,4.0712,3.2291,7.9783,0.9194,2.3485,5.4844,2.0062,1.4165,1.3288,2.2797,5.0947,0.7235,1.5052,3.6556,4.012,0.3275,0.6733,0.5447,0.0074,0.0108,0.802,4.9886,4.7472,5.0532,3.3003,2.1592,0.1112,0.7564,2.91,4.6889,3.4209,5.283,0.525,1.0966]}
{"id":4137,"ended":true,"length":238,"text":"The prominent narrative theme of the Tales series is the issue of coexistence between different races. A particular example of this is Tales of Rebirth, which extensively explores themes of racism. Scenario writer Takahash\u00eds favorite example is the conflict between humans and the demons who control the world. Tales of Rebirth tells a story of a human named Jihl-Sira, who is an adventurer of the White Lotus (i.e. a guild of adventurers devoted primarily to demon hunting), and has gained a reputation for dealing with demons. Jihl-Sira is approached by a man named Tare and his demon companion, Pazuzu, who has been captured by Jihl-Sira and her teammate, Rufus. The two men offer Jihl-Sira to join their guild as a member if she can slay his companion and release her from Pazuzu\u00eds possession. Jihl-Sira agrees to the duel and battles Pazuzu, who is revealed to be a high-ranked demon lord and the ruler of the Underworld. During the fight, Jihl-Sira becomes possessed by Pazuzu and loses her memory of her previous life. While in Pazuzu\u00eds possession, her memory and personality is taken over by the demon. Pazuzu then sets out to destroy the world as Jihl-Sira becomes aware that she must take responsibility for the destruction of her world in order to save her own soul.","token_len":304,"entropy":[10.1001,8.8472,8.9472,0.95,0.949,10.51,3.4559,0.6866,1.1931,8.0563,0.0928,9.1415,1.7817,1.2525,4.2855,1.1886,1.3385,4.2997,5.8116,3.4447,0.7313,0.3641,0.549,9.8007,1.4993,10.8536,0.791,1.6762,10.1374,1.7204,7.1598,0.3228,3.9939,3.8001,9.0142,3.1655,6.1522,7.1152,1.3533,9.6144,11.1296,6.8664,3.4445,0.9322,1.357,5.3409,0.198,3.942,0.1341,2.6541,4.3095,4.3202,3.6008,0.6927,2.1809,0.7323,4.4379,0.2896,0.3026,4.9379,1.9827,0.6782,0.3914,1.6155,2.7143,4.1274,5.3007,5.6148,5.1079,4.1557,3.8419,8.326,1.3567,0.4871,1.5494,3.8067,4.9545,3.7865,0.6633,6.5296,4.2965,5.0262,6.079,0.004,0.0003,0.8174,2.029,7.931,1.0759,2.7269,6.945,6.0374,0.01,8.5724,1.5546,2.0555,1.3884,4.5161,5.8347,1.7946,1.9432,1.0185,6.7359,0.4765,1.3919,0.7084,2.0824,0.0047,0.0021,0.1145,0.0021,0.0019,1.5386,6.5765,0.0669,1.1429,3.2122,0.3463,4.1111,4.9533,6.0355,2.831,5.2298,3.9825,0.6618,5.7422,3.6765,4.7387,0.7236,0.6017,0.8797,3.9692,1.9112,4.6169,0.404,3.4742,0.0068,0.0024,0.0178,0.0034,0.0011,1.3825,4.3297,8.3937,0.9136,4.0939,3.3657,0.4102,0.6324,2.135,1.2736,3.2061,5.7205,2.018,0.001,0.0009,0.0027,0.0015,0.0009,2.8807,2.3917,1.7973,1.2935,3.1897,0.7642,2.455,6.6396,0.647,2.7747,5.6585,4.3425,6.6859,2.2588,5.7358,2.4993,0.7914,5.5519,0.0009,0.0025,0.0017,5.571,4.9694,0.2486,2.1979,0.002,0.001,0.002,0.0016,0.0022,2.395,1.5173,2.7527,8.4031,1.0953,6.1492,2.364,0.0007,0.0017,0.0015,1.4683,1.4564,1.5389,6.1211,0.0555,0.1057,1.042,6.7569,0.8834,3.8251,0.5485,2.9524,2.9038,2.6642,4.4499,0.0119,0.579,5.7982,0.3423,4.7008,0.3463,1.5518,0.2022,1.021,0.0031,0.0008,0.0009,0.002,0.0015,4.533,4.0614,0.1525,2.6695,0.0016,0.0022,0.0011,1.2268,4.6709,0.9079,4.1305,2.089,1.3218,3.5882,0.6908,0.6697,4.1223,3.2593,2.6419,0.0021,0.0021,0.004,0.2108,0.644,0.1093,3.9607,2.4054,4.5827,2.8317,3.0178,4.5734,1.7397,0.0409,1.5616,1.0143,4.1041,3.306,0.0035,0.003,0.0009,2.8697,5.3564,1.336,0.3878,2.191,1.0344,2.3696,3.8646,2.7355,0.0031,0.0012,0.0074,0.0034,0.0027,4.5577,2.9654,2.308,0.9347,4.5072,4.1346,3.8819,0.1424,1.8178,1.5556,0.3839,2.4101,2.4841,4.4313,0.128,0.0766,2.4568,1.687,2.9028,3.1721,0.4105]}

{"id":3421,"ended":true,"length":289,"text":"Marsden first appeared on 5 March 2001 in the `` Who Shot Phil? `` storyline. In the whodunit storyline the five main suspects were Dan Sullivan, Steve Owen, Lisa Shaw, Michael Kelly [ and the victim himself Phil Mitchell ]. In a separate three-parter, the mystery of Phil Mitchell's apparent shooting is solved when it is revealed that it was the result of an assault between Phil and drug-dealer Johnny Moss ( played by Adrian Dunbar ) who had Phil's money and a picture of Phil's wife Sonia, in his pocket. During these episodes the characters also became embroiled in the ongoing war between the Street and Underworld gangs which started in early 1999. Following the initial assault which left Phil with stab wounds, the feud escalated as street and Underworld gangs were seen attacking each other on multiple occasions to settle scores. Phil was one of the key characters to be involved in this war with many of the street gangs being led by his arch-enemy Terry Waterfield ( Mark Williams ) ( and his henchmen Jimmy King ( Colin McKenzie ) and Mickey Bird ( Paul Green ) all having a personal vendetta against him. The storyline ended when Phil was stabbed again and left unconscious on the road. As a result of his injuries and the fact the police were unable to locate Moss, the case was thrown out. The next day he realised what had really happened to him and the next thing he knew he was home. He quickly made up with Steve Owen who he blamed for him being left for dead.","token_len":304,"entropy":[9.8267,7.4156,4.0751,1.3138,7.6243,3.1814,3.8165,2.0619,1.1769,11.7137,12.0482,5.4385,8.6584,3.9808,3.1678,7.3599,1.103,3.1322,1.147,11.5663,1.5781,1.0184,5.2086,4.1402,7.374,2.8749,5.7563,1.939,7.7662,6.6682,0.5069,5.177,8.6662,0.3135,6.7584,7.9581,0.5526,4.895,5.9574,8.3037,5.9178,4.6325,8.4064,4.5897,9.0685,5.3967,3.2437,2.7225,3.3985,3.8089,5.9002,0.388,3.9774,0.0074,1.0785,1.6509,6.4246,1.9452,2.1231,1.8884,0.4891,6.4818,5.7604,3.4441,3.0969,3.6998,4.8575,0.4285,0.1924,0.2043,4.6263,0.676,2.2508,5.9053,0.0017,1.7666,5.2376,5.5985,1.787,0.9611,11.4299,3.271,3.1823,0.2301,4.7874,7.5317,2.8866,8.1592,0.034,7.9454,5.7646,2.1706,3.0055,2.4043,2.0511,9.1804,2.0299,4.6753,2.0094,2.8891,6.482,0.1552,1.3539,1.6374,4.2714,8.9192,3.6178,3.7224,3.4818,2.837,0.2875,5.2171,5.9074,3.5479,2.114,4.3535,4.0555,5.4463,3.5429,0.0348,1.7611,4.2408,3.7139,0.9477,1.1839,10.3237,2.6503,9.3143,3.8412,3.5052,4.4732,1.0334,4.2713,3.7021,0.9589,5.3608,0.7505,4.3013,5.4197,5.8675,4.1175,1.0177,2.1991,7.5026,0.0219,1.4188,1.5765,8.7322,2.912,3.6703,7.9514,4.4637,1.1241,1.1808,3.1765,4.4783,3.5994,0.8969,0.0135,3.5925,2.823,0.1917,5.4413,6.728,3.0346,0.4358,2.4104,1.8177,4.3865,0.0271,0.475,5.4381,1.3233,1.773,3.0947,3.7723,0.2459,1.8903,2.1318,3.8214,4.6889,0.8493,0.4448,3.1169,0.3649,3.0237,4.5127,0.0657,4.4913,6.4245,1.2544,0.9501,8.7252,8.7671,3.0578,1.5642,7.0662,6.3263,1.5858,4.3154,5.7177,3.3438,5.2945,0.0006,0.7181,5.9882,7.001,1.8226,4.998,6.8586,0.8377,1.4613,6.683,8.4713,1.5943,4.335,5.6472,2.2796,7.3081,3.2814,3.0592,4.9939,1.6724,0.0003,0.158,2.4623,1.4411,2.3024,5.1851,5.0616,1.7404,0.9437,1.2892,4.4927,5.2081,1.9702,5.7494,3.2695,2.7986,0.6097,4.7146,1.847,4.4197,1.7854,0.2287,0.5261,2.6074,2.0469,2.8478,1.8791,2.5574,4.779,3.9176,1.8714,1.4089,0.0044,2.0105,10.628,1.1451,1.8837,5.3075,1.0295,3.7797,0.8186,2.4962,2.1984,3.7315,2.4484,5.2624,9.8869,2.9061,0.5349,5.8136,0.1161,2.2245,0.6845,0.6665,3.9609,4.0183,3.7837,0.3418,0.1511,1.2043,0.2254,6.1956,3.2908,2.299,5.3489,3.882,2.1249,4.1426,4.99,0.6757,2.3428,3.0312,5.9853,0.3992,6.075,1.9871,5.1666,4.4642,0.0156,1.0781]}

{"id":4323,"ended":true,"length":269,"text":"Patriotic Civil War tokens typically displayed a patriotic slogan or image on one or both sides. Since the majority of these tokens were minted in Union states, the slogans and images were decidedly Unionist. With the onset of the Civil War, most of the Union coin and token strikes ceased and coins and tokens from other mints came into currency. It was not, however, until well into the 1850's that another American-made coinage began. The American National Gold and Silver Coin Co. (ANGS) was incorporated in 1849 in St. Louis, Missouri. The ANGS became a commercial and legal tender coinage of the United States within a few months. The ANGS was similar in concept and design to American gold coins that had earlier been in circulation and were used in private transactions. The ANGS was first issued in January 1851 as the \" American Gold Shilling \". This coin was produced a mintage of 200,000 pieces and circulated briefly under the denomination \" Shilling \". All ANGS pieces are made of 90% U. S. gold, 5% silver and 0.8% copper. The coin was issued in denominations of 25, 50 and 100 dollars. The first three and fiftieth anniversaries of ANGS coins were produced without inscriptions and were therefore known as \" ANGS Silver Dollars \". The third anniversaries of coins were inscribed with an appropriate design.

{"id":4824,"ended":true,"length":279,"text":"Lord Howe Island is known for its geology, birds, plants, and marine life. Popular tourist activities include scuba diving, birdwatching, snorkelling, surfing, kayaking, and fishing.\n\nThe town of Norfolk Island itself appears to have been a settlement for around 2,000 years, with the name Norfolk coming from a word meaning \"the main island\", with the meaning of'main land' now thought to refer to Lord Howe Island. The earliest evidence of habitation came from the remains of a settlement, believed to be from around the 10th century.\n\nThe island has suffered extreme winds and major coastal erosion, including significant loss due to Cyclone Tracy in 1974.\n\nLord Howe Island is part of the Pacific Islands that have had the greatest impacts because of Cyclone Tracy as its winds passed to the east of the island. The island suffered extensive damage to its buildings, roads, electricity, telephone, and water supply.\n\nLord Howe Island is in the Torres Strait, the only route available for most tourists to travel to Australia. The island is more than 1,000 km (621 mi) west of the mainland and is connected to Australia using Lord Howe Island Airport which is operated and funded by Australia. Travel between Norfolk Island and Australia generally takes around two to three hours depending where on the island the passenger is going. Ferry service is available to Norfolk Island from Australia, although it is not currently scheduled at this time although this can change based on holiday traffic.","token_len":304,"entropy":[12.0688,8.8328,3.3216,4.7707,1.0048,0.4774,7.1495,1.6147,0.9937,7.9442,0.9292,5.0329,0.6532,1.2726,4.5859,0.2188,0.4779,9.6531,3.9142,5.8815,0.2183,7.2608,0.0117,0.0927,0.3321,3.9868,2.0211,0.1227,5.2341,0.0124,0.0038,2.0762,0.1826,4.3322,0.2275,2.8733,0.0074,0.1346,1.8222,2.7681,0.1936,1.2669,0.0007,2.3094,5.4979,1.773,7.6209,3.9337,6.4568,7.4403,0.2217,1.2662,1.2659,2.4744,6.7208,1.3904,6.0905,3.0601,0.0839,0.3715,0.9499,1.3467,2.4554,1.8203,4.6556,3.1488,3.7848,0.3429,2.7101,4.9104,2.116,0.6097,3.8918,6.2144,2.2988,3.1658,4.0623,0.9016,6.4867,1.499,16.9007,5.867,8.3713,9.9493,5.3588,8.014,0.0284,2.4898,0.0283,8.5778,0.5877,0.3106,0.4987,1.8884,5.156,4.6387,0.5454,8.695,0.1141,2.7411,0.5941,1.1327,4.8946,0.0132,0.8591,4.7152,3.9048,5.1619,0.0364,0.9872,5.0135,3.3355,3.3029,4.9438,0.037,0.1368,1.4408,0.8544,0.0003,1.6481,4.1591,2.8445,6.3064,6.6175,6.0314,1.2543,7.4175,4.75,1.5732,1.8637,4.3826,5.1025,4.4303,6.1064,0.0032,11.5085,0.0635,8.7796,1.4021,6.0279,0.6288,1.4892,0.0002,6.7868,0.0167,0.6092,1.2768,4.6957,0.0029,0.692,6.7549,2.7971,4.368,3.5723,4.6937,3.4986,2.826,3.1162,6.9001,0.3435,8.8673,0.0041,0.8639,4.8775,4.8005,2.9083,7.4609,5.764,0.8469,2.7256,2.6887,0.7171,0.9457,0.8786,1.9453,2.2001,4.4998,4.037,1.7127,1.8054,1.1397,5.0816,1.0988,3.4193,0.2697,6.8954,0.8712,5.1171,2.5901,1.1362,1.8376,0.7276,1.2151,0.5436,0.0002,4.4489,0.0713,0.3126,1.3482,4.4048,0.5627,7.7299,0.0043,1.5067,2.5851,3.9534,6.8704,4.5628,2.1602,5.6345,2.4701,1.5199,4.121,1.3403,4.3798,0.5993,2.0222,2.0133,1.0,5.5902,0.6379,2.7881,0.1685,0.7457,2.709,1.201,4.7863,5.5203,2.0435,0.0538,4.9141,0.2033,1.4066,3.3205,2.249,1.7704,5.1299,0.6888,2.7739,6.2597,10.2078,0.0405,0.8492,6.0315,3.8218,0.8973,3.2803,5.2007,3.6517,0.1149,3.48,0.9457,6.7964,4.0435,5.4156,0.5103,0.077,0.9705,6.8604,0.3711,2.2449,2.7978,3.3072,0.3719,0.8428,4.0612,6.6489,3.677,0.2805,1.449,3.007,6.7265,0.6873,3.4473,0.2741,8.8513,2.8453,1.3494,1.0969,2.1592,3.807,0.1034,1.8337,3.8127,2.221,3.1789,2.2624,0.5403,1.0519,4.3998,7.3262,5.7719,1.3423,0.1212,8.7517,4.4325,3.5159,1.287,4.7529,0.0248,7.1324,5.5539,0.6964]}

The port was very important to the Germans who needed to keep the river waterway open, and they made extensive attempts to cut off the invasion route.\n\nOmaha was an important part of the British war strategy for the invasion of Europe. The US 8th Army had been concentrating around Omaha Beach, and the beach area provided a powerful forward base into France, while the US and Canadian 5th Army forces had moved along the coast and held up the German 5th armoured division. To the north of Omaha the British had assembled the 6th and 10th Armies as well as the British 82nd Airborne Division, in order to cut off a German advance into the English Channel. The British also held the town of Bailleul further inland, which the Germans would need to cross in order to reach England.\n\nIn planning the initial stage of the D-Day Landings, codenamed Operation Overlord, the main British objectives had been to secure the beaches themselves and to block the path of the German advance inland by cutting off their supply line and communications. Operation Neptune, the first phase of the landings as well as the early stages of the fighting in Normandy, would then be allowed to continue unhindered to capture the city of Caen and its surroundings.","token_len":305,"entropy":[9.9168,2.6138,7.5409,5.9901,7.2674,3.4988,3.747,0.1295,7.1284,1.3888,6.7481,7.2208,2.7387,5.3061,10.9691,7.4587,5.9152,9.0561,7.9483,3.112,2.0293,5.6863,5.0375,5.5172,3.2809,4.0125,1.8891,8.4555,3.118,9.6432,1.8202,6.575,3.9924,2.0872,4.1242,7.9791,0.2508,1.224,2.6125,0.1379,2.2567,4.1604,3.3172,0.4839,1.495,6.4182,0.8456,5.8613,3.1187,0.6091,0.6736,6.4528,3.5616,4.9536,1.1656,3.1913,1.5692,5.863,4.2782,6.7998,1.3823,2.6186,1.2891,3.46,4.7737,4.7096,4.8327,0.2542,5.0637,1.4658,0.7693,9.2309,1.7751,1.1146,2.2624,0.1528,6.8113,0.4147,0.1747,1.5318,3.9142,0.4949,3.8371,0.0126,0.3209,3.8993,5.6248,5.8965,2.4827,0.763,3.5365,0.4128,3.1151,0.9837,1.4628,4.825,9.9243,0.1486,1.517,2.128,2.145,5.9468,5.9511,0.6174,4.9408,1.6386,1.4027,1.6265,5.8547,4.1703,5.2463,1.413,5.3954,8.2036,1.4859,8.4865,5.8053,2.4596,4.022,0.8607,2.9903,4.6901,4.0294,5.7608,0.0441,1.0866,3.9025,2.0878,3.0924,3.9689,0.5716,3.2306,3.1179,5.3045,3.6874,1.0101,3.9252,6.0629,0.0184,7.7673,1.2794,1.1346,5.3707,2.6958,1.4497,0.6907,0.29,4.1924,2.3065,1.6244,7.5996,2.7681,3.7973,0.0588,3.1277,4.2411,0.0018,2.7181,1.4357,4.4489,1.0474,0.1032,0.6096,4.1662,7.7423,0.1715,1.8493,0.0046,0.4315,1.3116,4.8016,2.2569,0.0149,5.3981,0.3752,3.7182,2.2346,1.0266,2.5452,1.3211,5.2634,0.7679,0.3511,1.5497,2.6301,3.3388,3.3059,1.5757,4.8279,0.1745,3.516,6.7051,2.7325,7.932,10.1268,2.5552,0.916,2.5589,4.0222,0.9279,3.9155,3.1539,0.2533,3.9705,2.7535,0.6273,0.0466,2.113,4.8856,0.4458,0.813,0.0002,3.2051,9.1601,0.9901,5.4453,6.5786,0.0664,0.1897,8.678,0.4911,0.0237,7.1879,0.3812,0.6151,9.612,0.2567,0.0334,3.2838,4.9836,1.1104,0.3989,0.8378,5.0217,5.011,3.3416,4.5782,0.1761,0.5172,3.2882,1.0559,2.7735,7.8839,1.3128,1.0301,5.3036,0.7979,6.456,0.3949,0.7521,1.349,1.2531,6.4132,4.9771,3.7568,0.2122,2.723,2.9558,2.1062,2.7418,5.6684,1.6706,4.2543,9.5533,2.2855,2.3225,2.7446,4.0598,0.1532,0.6753,3.2245,0.0041,5.8968,1.2815,0.0878,0.5625,5.7293,1.9025,0.0692,0.5278,6.1627,2.5062,2.5282,0.2728,3.858,5.0055,1.4749,9.1383,0.0467,3.5742,9.1583,0.0365,0.001,3.5958,4.1116,0.8095,4.6067,0.6479,8.0645,0.3163,1.8954,2.6369,4.216,0.4049]}
{"id":3863,"ended":false,"length":273,"text":"Soil invertebrates and larvae make up most of the wood thrush's omnivorous diet, but it will also eat fruits in the late summer, fall, and late winter. It occasionally feeds young birds [ 9 ] or nestlings of other species. [ 10 ] It will also sometimes feed on carrion, particularly in the winter. This may seem strange to us, but it can be quite common for large birds to gather small rodents and vertebrates in the winter. [ 2 8, 11 1, 12 1, 13, 14, 15, 16 [ 17 20 ] ]\n\nLarge trees on the prairie and tundra offer good food for wood thrush nestlings, but are sometimes too scarce to support full feeding populations. Small trees may also offer supplementary feeding, but often only on very select crops [ 20, 21 ]. The ground layers of shrubs provide food during the adult's diapause, which may take up to two years to complete [ 8 ].\n\nWood thrushes are insectivores, but they may consume all food available to them during the spring.

{"id":3314,"ended":true,"length":288,"text":"Before the Reform Act 1832, Runcorn was in the parliamentary constituency of Cheshire which was represented by two Members of Parliament. Following the Reform Act, the town was placed in the North West constituency which was represented by one MP. Although the area was much smaller than in the past, Runcorn continued to have its own elected borough council up until the Reform Act of 1832 when responsibility for local government was transferred to the County Borough of Runcorn. The new borough council inherited a number of responsibilities from the former township councils, mainly from the responsibilities relating to water supply. At the time, the population of the town of Runcorn was 3,000 which was only slightly less than the population of the borough of Runcorn which was almost five thousand. The population in 1832 was 7,600 as compared to nearly nineteen thousand people today making the town one of the fastest growing towns in the United Kingdom.\n\nBy 1850, much effort had been concentrated on improving the water supply of the town, the problems that were faced in the years before the advent of the water supply system are seen by some to be the reason why the town did not maintain a leading role in British manufacturing industries for much of the second half of the nineteenth century. By the end of the nineteenth century, the water supply issue had been totally resolved and water rates were far lower than in many other towns of the same size. By the 1960s, Runcorn had a population of almost thirteen thousand with the population more than doubling within forty years.","token_len":305,"entropy":[2.551,11.223,3.7349,9.6426,5.0667,0.6904,12.859,4.1097,2.3184,4.7539,1.7109,10.1932,5.2361,0.1653,7.9922,0.2444,5.169,1.4228,3.979,0.1477,5.4283,5.9121,0.1537,0.9402,1.1083,6.9586,0.6859,2.6661,0.0715,3.2041,2.4199,5.843,1.233,4.9354,1.1604,0.7831,5.8255,2.1694,4.2013,3.5362,0.7021,0.2134,0.0232,2.0007,5.2459,0.6903,5.7614,1.3326,5.539,0.8274,6.1592,1.5963,0.6364,3.0689,0.5241,3.8621,0.3144,2.121,0.0005,3.8295,0.1262,2.3896,2.5651,1.2402,4.5921,7.1648,1.8719,9.4515,1.1882,0.9392,1.5298,0.0477,3.743,0.2184,1.6131,4.1387,10.5993,0.3763,2.7558,0.8623,0.8048,0.5549,0.2511,0.5201,3.9558,4.0341,1.3421,4.3415,0.0062,0.4302,2.0968,3.5256,1.5726,0.3654,7.9854,2.91,2.8021,0.0031,3.3012,1.6048,0.4233,2.6073,7.0009,3.7891,2.1625,5.5637,3.0542,0.4999,8.8951,5.6238,0.0184,5.6155,2.4865,1.8572,4.9323,0.5724,1.1518,1.4966,1.159,6.1333,0.5242,1.2539,1.3028,2.6226,0.112,0.0002,0.3042,4.8483,0.0935,2.2447,4.7713,0.9446,4.1244,2.8032,2.4242,0.0218,1.0989,2.559,0.1796,1.1938,3.9468,0.3386,5.4586,0.0115,3.0655,0.7648,5.472,5.1365,3.1679,0.4419,1.6025,3.5438,4.1216,7.2114,1.2763,0.3691,4.3828,0.4588,3.6308,4.4172,1.6923,0.2184,6.9082,9.0978,0.0667,4.1243,3.4502,7.2293,1.3232,0.6005,2.2848,0.0291,0.0769,4.4501,0.013,1.0831,0.0964,1.0033,2.9109,0.0552,0.248,1.486,0.033,4.6323,4.7293,0.8934,7.0605,6.7681,0.4546,0.0606,8.0632,1.1231,2.356,0.518,4.4378,0.6192,1.1005,0.612,0.3786,2.2879,3.5863,6.242,3.649,2.5825,3.3757,3.149,1.0325,4.8155,2.9197,0.602,6.3368,0.0029,0.8095,3.4636,2.1113,2.3083,5.9044,5.7904,2.9797,2.0957,1.2312,0.9037,1.8991,4.3,1.0852,1.0265,0.7229,4.0144,0.0666,5.1883,2.6905,8.7484,1.0063,0.1361,4.685,5.4284,5.2116,2.4726,2.9955,0.1696,0.1363,4.8558,0.0618,0.003,0.0287,1.3375,0.0079,0.1557,4.0836,0.9357,1.7773,0.002,0.1684,1.1137,0.0102,0.4628,1.2321,3.0431,0.6224,5.4756,0.9772,1.0729,6.9685,1.4526,1.1707,3.3986,6.2572,1.2122,5.8971,1.0404,0.314,1.5418,3.8137,0.814,1.9057,2.1155,0.3746,2.4823,0.9906,0.492,3.5314,0.7234,4.9312,0.1082,0.477,3.4021,0.001,0.9429,3.283,2.0563,0.1906,3.7828,4.8813,0.2165,3.3912,1.8661,2.2697,6.8138,0.1918,3.3325,4.6488,5.9519,0.0801,0.5436]}

{"id":2988,"ended":true,"length":279,"text":"As Emperor, Domitian quickly dispensed with the republican facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign. By moving the centre of government ( more or less formally ) to the imperial palace, which became the new capital, he allowed himself to be much more involved in the affairs of the state. It is probable that he also changed the name of the state ( from Romae ; see \"Roman\" ) to Augustus, thus putting a period at the end of the name of the roman kingdom, thus creating one of the great epigraphic and linguistic blunders of the history of the Roman Empire and of the Latin language. The first Augustus was Augustus Caesar, who is usually also credited with the creation of the Julian calendar but the creation of the Julian calendar has not been proved historically to have been his responsibility. The first emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty ( after the death of Augustus Caesar ) was Claudius Claudius Marcellus Aurelianus Augustus Nero Claudius Drusus.\n\nEmperor Augustus is considered to be the last roman king of any sort. He was known to have brought the Roman Republic to an end by granting provinces and other privileges to his closest associates and generals. They became his chief advisors and the Senate was dissolved. There remained however the imperial cult and the Senate was allowed to continue to exist as long as it was willing to make all the appropriate sacrifices to the new cult of Augustus, the cult of the eternal city and the cult of the gods.","token_len":305,"entropy":[11.8047,1.9524,8.4243,3.6331,0.221,7.8333,7.1055,0.5016,0.4395,1.1538,11.2822,8.0795,7.6295,3.6901,4.8781,3.9411,0.4255,5.7695,3.1976,2.1195,2.8299,0.9488,5.1412,6.9033,2.6256,7.2672,0.1471,5.1863,5.2363,13.1308,2.6555,0.0016,6.0483,3.5758,1.3113,0.7032,6.5097,1.3226,0.7091,4.4947,4.491,1.0428,3.8012,2.1361,1.4738,1.7293,5.0666,4.2814,0.4077,0.544,7.3719,0.5766,4.2799,0.4227,1.0512,1.5885,0.0503,0.5288,2.8977,0.7346,4.0277,1.6877,4.5589,0.2804,1.6725,2.2605,5.6275,1.145,3.3314,0.1367,0.5276,3.0499,3.6854,6.3678,7.3347,4.4588,7.2768,5.0786,4.4753,4.0815,5.7726,1.8769,0.5951,6.2383,1.5359,5.0917,5.5938,2.8428,6.3708,2.686,0.6345,1.4711,0.0617,0.7698,6.2323,1.236,0.8258,9.7644,0.3076,4.4036,2.7048,4.2894,3.7532,4.3829,0.454,0.1244,3.9932,6.9083,0.5746,2.2766,3.8234,4.6746,6.9569,0.0377,0.2969,0.4331,4.8789,0.033,0.6383,1.1035,0.3723,4.4108,1.7719,0.693,5.4474,4.0152,0.4908,2.3083,4.1657,7.8008,1.969,5.9343,2.9584,0.7753,1.8541,4.4425,4.3891,6.1126,5.9774,0.284,1.4881,3.2662,0.0509,0.5152,8.8333,1.7888,6.586,3.8262,6.4145,0.0543,0.3747,2.2247,0.1603,3.5526,3.0142,0.2221,5.1362,5.9494,3.5198,0.3492,0.5809,3.734,5.4666,0.5043,1.8172,2.8416,2.2212,1.7786,0.726,9.7341,0.0618,2.5876,1.0745,0.826,0.8867,1.7567,6.6916,1.1872,2.7373,0.0195,2.2458,2.6641,0.7351,0.6571,4.414,0.0424,2.3229,0.0487,6.0482,1.1698,0.9575,6.397,0.0915,1.724,0.4206,3.9024,7.1908,1.8707,0.0995,8.9629,0.4566,0.2535,3.5844,3.4624,0.2407,5.0453,0.1177,1.1165,3.2424,3.868,1.0649,1.3371,0.505,4.019,5.8995,0.0145,3.255,0.8436,5.9953,6.3587,1.5272,1.4947,1.0434,4.6396,1.718,0.6549,5.9872,2.0663,2.1219,3.8839,1.053,1.5043,0.0891,1.8341,5.3712,7.5712,2.8379,4.9219,3.4112,0.5579,2.3098,7.1303,2.6429,1.987,6.8899,0.9412,6.6707,4.2714,2.7297,4.8156,3.5827,0.9566,3.9529,7.0072,2.1762,5.4259,1.6708,4.6917,6.348,6.5416,2.5639,4.9793,7.9924,3.0344,1.5844,7.0345,1.5672,5.6821,0.1395,2.4555,1.4285,2.7781,2.5419,3.3687,0.0084,1.4859,1.5727,6.2565,0.1801,4.7254,5.6084,2.1612,6.5693,1.8262,1.2602,2.1113,5.1661,8.2789,2.2892,2.5583,2.5823,3.1202,4.0151,0.3028,1.7348,7.9744,6.7838,2.7313,0.6473,0.1552,0.0126,0.7576,4.7561,0.5042]}
{"id":4823,"ended":true,"length":262,"text":"The first exporter of palm seeds was Ned King, a mountain guide for the Fitzgerald surveys of 1869 and 1876, who sent seed to the Sydney Botanic Gardens. Overseas trade began in the 1880s, when the Queensland Agricultural Society established a seed company in Brisbane. The first shipment to Vanuatu was in 1905, a year after VUZU became independent from France. Plant variety testing by the Queensland Planting & Nurseries Bureau began at the Vanuatu nursery in the late 1940s, and began exporting in 1958. More than 90% of tropical oil palms in Vanuatu are registered and approved by VUZU.\n\nOil palm farming started in Vanuatu in the 1960s, but it was the introduction of the Bali 9 and the Bali 15 as early as 1969 to assist with the production of kerosene that was the major catalyst. As the plantations expanded further afield during the 1980s, so more seed imports followed. A ban on importing palm oil from palm oil producing areas in Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia due to their deforestation problems during the 1990s led to a sharp rise in the price of oil palm seeds in Vanuatu. Plantation expansion and planting of high-yielding trees in the mid-1990s led to increased production. Since then the major plantation companies have invested further in palm oil processing plants, and the oil palm value chain has been established. The government has encouraged this expansion, with various incentives including tax rebates.","token_len":305,"entropy":[5.3423,10.9548,3.7752,0.659,8.2921,6.6084,1.9098,10.3618,7.8853,1.2287,2.3236,8.5105,4.9417,3.9439,0.681,12.6809,14.0781,3.4255,2.3767,4.6838,2.5109,1.321,2.0066,1.6043,0.5951,5.6016,4.836,2.8821,1.5875,10.7144,4.9766,0.6752,0.6124,1.8168,12.191,0.0666,6.2875,4.0119,1.1812,1.562,3.3684,0.0421,1.1445,2.374,1.6046,5.7208,4.0469,3.6836,3.141,1.2215,3.2628,3.8554,1.6834,3.6093,1.0803,2.0039,2.8419,4.976,2.8885,10.8617,1.6756,0.0008,1.1995,2.0963,5.095,0.5994,4.2541,2.3023,0.5434,6.2384,6.6214,6.2418,2.0586,4.0706,2.5894,2.0825,6.2078,0.3536,6.873,7.9679,6.9128,3.1976,1.0712,3.5734,3.6492,3.8983,4.278,4.7982,2.0951,5.1738,3.5708,4.8408,0.8704,4.8876,0.003,0.0113,7.3843,0.5823,3.2486,1.9923,3.5853,0.0083,1.0836,0.94,4.6781,4.9595,2.9839,4.2795,0.2181,5.5183,0.564,4.2375,2.2058,0.0312,6.7107,7.3585,6.2587,2.4248,3.6487,0.0016,0.0013,0.7091,7.1666,4.0399,5.8423,1.6221,5.3179,0.0641,0.015,0.0021,1.2007,1.1377,0.0011,6.3767,0.5989,5.5599,4.2038,0.5451,2.6069,0.0021,0.0034,0.3822,0.9073,3.1069,0.0033,0.842,2.7557,2.499,1.4505,3.3293,3.2363,0.0382,1.7666,6.0233,3.0664,8.6058,3.5034,1.7034,4.0613,0.1904,4.69,5.713,1.7832,0.1441,4.6034,6.1365,6.903,2.1898,0.8896,3.3384,0.2011,7.3289,3.0123,0.0001,4.6741,2.0384,3.7187,2.9706,4.4923,3.4588,4.1581,1.3447,5.2224,1.9607,4.763,6.7045,4.4759,5.4742,0.2623,2.2094,0.0117,0.4166,5.634,7.3878,3.6647,6.2665,4.0752,0.5719,4.1565,6.7755,0.3238,3.9256,1.584,0.4949,1.7089,7.4886,2.3893,4.0528,2.1284,2.0333,6.766,3.0515,3.2404,3.614,1.259,0.8008,6.6168,0.0063,3.2722,5.1897,5.2792,4.551,0.3094,1.67,0.0098,5.7086,0.0529,1.5368,4.8922,2.7283,0.0254,1.5015,2.3509,0.107,1.2859,1.8192,3.4015,2.7418,2.2138,0.0014,0.0028,0.4646,5.9909,2.9062,3.3151,3.0605,4.407,1.3984,6.3306,1.4194,2.9291,0.2094,3.2057,1.9958,1.4746,3.9095,0.3222,1.0036,0.0005,2.4307,0.0328,3.2334,2.4149,2.19,4.9387,1.0552,2.3818,6.9398,5.1928,4.2992,0.8576,4.444,6.4696,0.4395,4.3247,0.4063,4.4511,2.8398,1.4548,1.962,2.1142,4.943,0.1995,8.7199,6.0138,0.5277,2.6039,4.8232,0.9899,2.5763,5.5754,1.2867,5.271,4.9041,2.776,1.7006,2.1519,5.898,4.6537,1.8347,3.3998,3.9587,0.0008,2.9232]}
{"id":2562,"ended":true,"length":277,"text":"The first engagement that Australian troops were involved in during the Second World War came at Bardia, a major Italian military outpost in the north of Libya. The 16th Brigade broke through Bardia's defences on the morning of 1 October 1940. Once in the town, they proceeded to burn the town to the ground, while killing a large number of civilians in the process, many of whom were children. It was a shocking attack on innocent people, and it had the effect of alienating the Australian people from their military, and contributing greatly to the ongoing decline in support for our war effort during the remainder of the war.\n\nIt was an attack that Australians were not only aware of, but participated in. In fact, Bardia was the place that had the greatest impact because the military presence in the town was so great. Other examples of similar actions occurred at Bouljanne, El Alamein, Tobruk and Palermo.\n\nAustralian casualties at Bardia were heavy, with over 600 men killed in the fighting. In addition there were around 300 more who were wounded. Casualties on the Italian side totalled 5,000.\n\nAustralia has had other moments of national disgrace during and after war. Most notable was the conduct of our soldiers in Bataan and the execution of thousands of them, including innocent children. But as shocking as Bardia was, this type of action was not something that occurred often, although the slaughter of children was one of the worst of its kind.","token_len":305,"entropy":[5.3423,10.0878,4.4604,10.3367,3.4267,2.9376,2.9647,0.1006,2.8084,0.5622,3.052,0.3501,0.0005,3.5396,2.9037,10.9493,5.3545,1.5053,2.9646,4.6781,7.2044,3.3838,4.3855,1.3311,0.9966,3.3262,0.4519,6.6778,0.551,1.8547,8.2562,0.6583,3.2848,7.1868,0.8292,10.3474,0.0098,0.4713,1.9606,2.6982,2.6082,2.4446,0.024,4.2097,2.6272,2.551,1.8639,6.2846,2.8026,1.3262,3.4751,0.3491,1.4357,5.6992,0.5557,5.5466,1.5154,2.3665,1.6895,0.1131,0.0034,1.3359,4.1456,6.2238,3.2978,2.5814,0.21,0.0096,1.3755,3.5612,0.9204,0.0861,2.8279,4.2751,0.2114,0.3421,0.633,3.8117,0.3204,4.091,0.4678,2.1669,4.9393,3.4929,1.3128,3.4506,2.3603,1.0267,1.4827,2.6219,4.3229,2.2378,1.0828,0.0385,6.2011,0.0024,1.199,4.4076,2.9589,2.2898,1.4668,3.589,4.3382,1.9963,7.3925,4.9154,0.0211,0.3882,5.1766,6.7363,1.4872,4.9415,0.2718,5.6056,3.8448,0.5076,5.6389,0.2993,6.2193,0.0006,0.1476,0.0754,0.1015,0.8836,0.0079,3.6881,0.7731,3.3809,2.8699,1.4126,6.9481,2.1579,2.4093,3.955,3.5956,0.0235,0.5563,0.0809,5.9549,0.0232,1.2299,2.4974,2.4745,0.1219,8.2333,0.0095,0.6827,1.9802,5.324,2.2048,3.6628,1.1197,2.87,1.2118,7.5152,2.5741,4.4753,3.6446,2.5343,0.6956,0.9024,0.939,0.9844,2.3253,0.6989,6.5078,5.4736,0.5807,5.5245,2.6243,3.7616,2.3228,4.0845,3.1459,12.0339,5.1347,0.7704,7.0206,3.4459,0.496,0.0497,0.488,8.6399,0.0969,0.0308,1.042,5.576,3.0876,0.0062,0.7298,1.419,0.0001,4.2192,4.3726,2.7031,0.5405,0.0074,2.2804,6.2172,1.1572,2.0998,3.0143,4.4085,4.8971,0.6332,2.0257,1.0385,2.5973,0.6018,2.7972,1.6593,6.0086,0.1368,4.4246,3.4735,5.0223,2.7004,1.009,1.1318,1.6607,5.7743,0.2446,4.3281,0.7611,4.9338,0.2411,7.1544,0.0049,4.3657,0.8407,1.0052,1.5858,1.3711,0.0002,3.5293,4.588,2.9796,6.1081,8.2122,0.4213,5.65,4.3785,2.6719,5.7151,0.2089,3.5966,0.6974,5.0647,3.2903,1.1384,0.4145,7.2331,0.0836,4.4515,3.959,1.2987,5.161,5.1036,0.3254,3.1099,2.0564,5.93,0.09,5.7436,0.098,6.191,2.9309,2.8391,6.8563,2.1438,0.5535,4.2828,4.4569,9.5491,0.0839,4.9044,0.0062,0.4371,0.3721,3.7151,5.9283,0.0019,2.8566,1.1841,1.4259,4.8698,0.9436,3.7474,4.0557,2.3729,4.5953,2.6634,6.5855,1.1366,2.7533,1.4074,3.7793,0.6594,0.3973,2.6787,3.8913,2.6411,0.0471,0.5755]}

{"id":4260,"ended":false,"length":241,"text":"Lung cancers are classified according to histological type. This classification is important for determining management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are carcinomas \u2014 malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. There are two histological types of lung cancers: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. SCC is the most common histological type in lung cancer, accounting for about 60% of cases. A histological type distinction can sometimes be helpful in predicting the malignancy aggressiveness and prognosis of SCC. A histological type classification is not required for all patients and is not always helpful and can be confusing to interpret and apply. In 2009, lung cancers were histologically classified into stages 0 (i.e., N0), 1A (i.e., N1), 1B (i.e., N2), 2A (i.e., N2a), 2B (i.e., N2b), 3A (i.e., N3) and 3B (i.e., N3b) according to their Gleason score. Gleason score is a multi-dimensional measure that is used to describe a tumour\u2019s microscopic cancer and to categorise the extent and aggressiveness of the tumour. There is strong evidence that stage and risk status is a far more accurate predictor of long-term prognosis than type of lung cancer.\n\nFor a complete breakdown of the histological subtypes of lung cancer please click here","token_len":306,"entropy":[8.2306,12.3388,2.1334,6.5808,2.7265,0.0037,7.2335,0.8975,4.4671,1.6279,4.0574,2.5116,1.0884,4.9364,1.8231,3.587,9.0327,2.7061,7.9914,3.8598,2.1504,3.2119,1.2918,0.4642,6.1286,1.8293,0.9044,5.8156,1.9275,7.3014,6.5823,4.6089,0.0756,1.0117,3.8897,0.8051,7.1086,0.0102,1.1466,2.3998,4.6419,0.2875,2.0322,6.226,0.5209,0.1964,0.8374,0.5512,1.4349,0.7802,6.6021,0.0029,0.181,0.0801,0.057,0.8299,4.9672,0.0401,0.53,0.0003,0.001,0.0243,0.2057,5.9613,4.3995,1.501,1.6315,0.441,0.0937,5.8475,0.2451,0.1658,2.4143,2.9216,0.6911,1.7395,2.497,0.0037,2.3318,3.5757,0.5807,0.0423,3.2264,0.7923,4.1532,4.7007,0.2557,1.0158,11.1126,2.3504,5.2642,0.2054,3.2682,0.9298,3.9067,1.4839,7.4212,0.1105,0.288,12.1746,0.0772,2.9048,4.4273,0.0057,0.5523,5.095,0.0074,0.523,3.3981,1.2299,0.105,0.6955,2.0031,1.4647,3.0948,3.4326,0.631,3.4228,3.6537,2.93,2.0214,1.9689,3.7286,3.755,5.1256,2.2625,1.0972,2.3515,2.6596,8.0485,4.1071,5.2514,0.6338,3.278,7.7369,0.2147,5.2246,3.3368,0.7903,11.5226,0.0773,0.7852,2.7517,8.4004,5.2787,2.8803,4.9542,0.0183,0.0045,0.121,6.9274,4.651,1.3937,0.5971,8.7563,0.4746,0.2048,0.0016,0.0015,0.0082,0.9534,0.1689,0.2618,4.038,0.2754,0.0707,0.0187,0.0015,0.0068,0.0308,0.0618,0.0541,0.1655,0.7227,0.9342,0.0911,0.0158,0.0015,0.0058,0.028,0.0107,4.1524,4.0139,0.1666,0.9521,0.1465,0.0049,0.0049,0.0022,0.0053,0.0337,0.0073,0.7439,0.0575,0.1462,1.4278,0.3441,0.007,0.0069,0.0025,0.0053,0.0425,0.0139,0.0471,2.7883,0.1081,0.2293,0.2758,0.0022,0.0065,0.0025,0.005,0.0297,0.0108,0.1534,0.4452,2.5477,3.9596,0.0017,3.2722,12.8223,0.0244,1.7012,0.5938,6.5265,0.0018,1.4422,0.9796,1.2514,7.7343,0.0338,3.845,1.4418,1.6574,1.9978,0.8988,0.2657,4.669,2.9658,10.444,0.0641,13.7928,8.2671,4.9332,9.7116,8.4848,3.5652,2.4675,4.621,1.2292,1.3598,6.8851,2.5481,7.7373,0.0171,0.0601,1.1714,0.9703,0.0572,0.4381,4.1169,1.8397,6.0988,0.7232,0.4621,6.6077,6.1586,5.954,7.4505,3.9534,3.4357,8.8544,0.638,3.7566,1.6502,0.1229,6.508,0.2034,0.0338,2.6591,0.0036,0.6816,4.5358,1.1719,1.782,0.0464,0.4321,2.4243,0.0007,5.2827,3.2667,1.9831,4.7189,0.0397,1.1591,1.6043,0.2719,5.5232,0.3859,0.9236,0.295,0.2484,5.4314,2.7266,0.4242]}

He added that he wanted to have a more realistic look at people suffering from the afflictions that haunt their minds, instead of a typical masala action spectacle.\n\n4 : Despite all his efforts, the film did not have any major release. However it had some small screen telecasts during Deepavali in the Tamil and Kerala areas.\n\n5 : There is speculation that Jayarajan was the one behind the recent Tamil film, Iruvar (2004 ), which was originally going to be a Malayalam film.

{"id":1230,"ended":true,"length":294,"text":"In his own writings, Abu @ - @ Jamal describes his adolescent experience of being `` kicked... into the Black Panther Party `` after suffering a beating from `` white racists `` and witnessing the torture and execution of Fred Hampton. Although he admits a `` reluctance to identify myself as a Black Panther `` he later identifies himself `` as belonging to that group for seven years... from 1969 through 1973 \" (Jamal, 1-15-94). We must never forget Jamal's personal history. His commitment to working with those in need was not merely a reaction to injustice. At the time of his commitment to and involvement with the Panthers, he was deeply motivated by his belief in the liberation of Black people in the United States. The Black Panthers were but one movement in a long line of struggles to rid the United States not only of racism but of all forms of oppression and exploitation. These included struggles against segregation, racism, sexism and capitalism.\n\nHe also worked closely with people suffering from the AIDS epidemic and had personal and professional relationships with both men and women who were dying from AIDS. Jamal played an important role in helping people overcome the feelings of helplessness and hopelessness that come when loved ones have succumbed to AIDS. His death is a loss for all the humanitarians who had hoped to see his work continue.\n\nWe will remember Jamal in our work to free others from the traps of racism, hate and homophobia. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those who know him and to the many whose lives he touched.","token_len":306,"entropy":[5.6528,4.5662,5.2013,0.3501,8.1933,11.9228,8.0382,4.0292,7.8316,7.9392,2.1228,9.4993,3.9891,1.5053,2.4117,11.8536,12.1928,7.2599,4.624,2.0295,8.8721,3.4072,0.739,5.9669,3.9681,7.0075,1.1242,4.0321,2.4785,7.105,4.3772,4.2559,3.3085,2.1702,6.8618,1.7529,6.238,1.4399,3.6162,0.0885,8.3189,1.8375,1.4201,6.199,1.5483,4.2092,6.0781,3.6085,9.2899,0.2501,5.756,3.1103,0.4645,0.5695,3.2187,0.0804,3.4692,2.0063,5.0689,5.2569,1.0024,5.147,0.1328,7.4985,0.15,5.3226,1.6184,4.9385,7.0509,0.3052,5.4722,6.0902,5.2745,2.1595,3.7772,7.3559,2.8999,5.8957,0.0297,1.0742,6.2898,2.5537,4.3255,1.793,5.5429,0.5463,5.7573,3.8119,4.8963,0.4539,4.5802,0.3139,4.6382,2.7666,1.5993,3.0438,7.2084,0.1346,6.5499,1.592,4.8542,2.6214,2.078,2.291,4.0001,4.2377,1.8165,6.0397,0.0831,3.8413,2.2053,5.0569,0.8528,1.3104,0.9934,0.6187,8.7619,1.1162,7.5533,3.1282,1.1604,0.6146,2.714,0.4731,1.7598,0.9447,4.727,6.0469,0.549,1.8632,2.1133,1.098,0.8256,5.3912,0.0918,3.0606,0.6655,3.232,0.95,1.9968,0.0027,1.0946,3.2431,5.3027,1.2113,1.3603,8.4821,1.0319,5.017,0.9238,0.743,1.1932,1.2312,0.1018,3.197,2.4708,6.8654,0.5652,1.8766,0.002,10.2339,0.4311,0.0405,2.8344,0.6752,1.2576,2.4661,0.4072,0.005,0.9789,2.5768,2.9254,0.5402,4.3699,4.594,6.0585,1.6744,4.5339,0.5133,2.7135,0.2476,2.7623,1.7739,5.5401,0.6242,4.1017,0.2125,4.5372,2.4772,4.2443,2.669,0.0193,5.5984,4.9859,0.3823,3.0278,3.5722,0.2943,1.7153,4.706,4.9915,3.9113,1.0547,2.815,0.0989,4.2518,3.6447,0.0519,0.0064,1.4438,1.3819,5.5562,1.6554,0.2304,0.4132,1.538,7.5619,1.3988,0.5923,0.1391,0.0866,3.3751,3.5305,3.7908,1.4549,6.9704,0.1677,3.8682,0.0101,0.8422,2.6482,0.0043,1.2695,4.5054,4.6458,8.9069,0.0126,3.2231,4.9498,0.166,1.2092,0.3698,3.1594,6.4494,2.817,1.4015,3.6759,1.5469,1.4983,3.7026,6.7589,7.1079,0.0005,1.1766,3.1208,5.5705,0.939,2.7395,2.835,2.3988,5.4603,0.7214,1.4194,0.0003,4.3766,3.6804,4.0209,0.2092,3.1291,2.1472,5.6296,3.9107,4.6842,4.3468,0.59,0.9233,8.6639,0.5329,1.9889,1.286,5.9042,0.6075,3.9341,0.702,3.804,5.6534,0.5183,0.1817,1.4219,0.0536,0.0246,2.8071,1.0428,0.4846,5.8757,1.2136,1.0053,1.8089,2.6125,2.247,4.933,0.8109,1.7465,1.0273,0.3537]}

In early 1940, he was appointed commander of 22nd Battalion, then forming at Wellington. During the course of 1943, he was promoted to a major-general and command of the 1st Division, then on the border of South Africa. His time out of the forces was spent in the Northland area.\n\nDuring World War II, Andrew was the commander of the 8th Division from 1942 to 1944 and of the 1st Division from 1944 to 1945. At the end of the war, and as war-time conscription was due to be introduced in New Zealand, he was appointed the chairman of the New Zealand Military Service Board. The Military Service Board and the NZ General Classification Board (later the New Zealand Labour Court) administered the New Zealand Service and Compensation Scheme, known as the NZSSC. In 1948, the New Zealand Labour Party brought forward proposals for the NZSSC ( and compensation for dependents) to replace the British Ministry of Pensions, which had been introduced following the end of the First World War.\n\nAs chairman of the Labour Court for only a few weeks in 1948, he was unable to resolve the differences the Labour Court was experiencing with the Board; however, this did result in the board agreeing to drop its proposal to make the NZSSC less generous than British pensions.\n\nFrom 1950 until his retirement in 1975 he was Governor of the Otago University.","token_len":306,"entropy":[2.5081,5.99,0.6908,0.9949,3.2236,0.0923,0.0009,0.3072,9.5007,4.3757,8.8131,0.9811,1.1473,0.9571,7.6838,0.0954,6.1854,1.469,4.7409,0.208,0.3037,1.8924,2.6726,4.6035,3.5609,0.5257,1.045,1.064,3.7116,3.1985,0.1837,7.986,1.4139,2.4744,0.6897,7.6329,10.1807,7.4173,3.5467,1.9272,3.7077,0.7825,3.8085,0.0007,5.4409,0.7166,0.803,1.1417,2.3297,0.1226,3.9412,4.0538,3.8144,0.0488,1.901,4.2458,1.0675,1.1079,2.3799,0.0058,3.6548,1.4668,2.585,5.3351,1.7625,8.0538,1.2368,3.2635,0.7387,0.6748,3.6962,5.4448,7.0892,0.6031,0.8239,5.6904,1.8251,2.8148,0.9554,1.5897,4.9318,5.0777,5.332,2.1239,1.5604,0.0156,3.4723,2.0773,0.0011,0.2129,0.2239,0.6198,1.3114,3.3945,2.6171,0.1507,0.6457,4.8059,0.0823,2.3651,3.8412,3.1509,0.5879,1.4717,2.5445,3.5862,0.1939,2.1884,0.0058,1.0291,0.3286,0.699,0.1509,0.5636,0.1861,4.1467,1.0445,1.1485,0.0018,1.4095,0.3212,0.3661,6.7634,3.3791,6.0582,4.4672,0.8521,7.0478,1.6241,1.8321,6.345,0.2268,1.9077,3.4738,1.3838,5.3585,0.0029,0.5372,0.9261,0.8872,3.3739,3.5024,5.6508,0.08,0.1843,2.4755,0.0131,3.5619,3.4414,1.3996,0.8667,3.7711,6.9073,0.2457,0.1185,5.2264,1.0838,2.7696,5.8316,6.4101,1.2141,3.3877,4.63,0.8307,2.7834,0.0286,5.7705,5.93,0.3159,6.4599,0.7007,2.2698,0.0018,4.1813,2.8532,6.332,3.1413,1.9748,6.8128,0.1142,0.3564,1.9844,4.83,2.8583,0.3514,2.4747,3.5118,0.2314,2.846,2.2372,0.004,1.8885,5.5529,5.8049,3.3684,6.4922,0.6912,1.4877,2.6819,0.3397,0.0155,4.8001,8.5275,8.2766,1.6299,9.0928,0.154,3.1876,1.1996,2.9257,0.4477,4.6825,5.4279,0.0617,9.954,0.0067,2.4229,1.9602,0.8215,1.1768,5.5664,4.7393,0.3744,4.0131,0.0059,0.9168,3.4824,0.0412,0.0008,0.2551,1.3155,0.0002,4.1219,5.3676,0.1894,0.0833,3.2509,4.7414,4.1382,9.4353,1.8761,1.314,2.0781,1.0793,1.6911,0.1832,2.391,1.06,4.3978,0.0353,5.8261,0.7443,4.6085,6.9172,1.3748,2.2277,3.3171,4.9531,1.7745,0.4092,7.8752,5.9245,2.1948,0.0691,4.5664,2.4264,5.0278,0.0083,1.1632,6.2745,3.8365,0.3827,8.189,2.4272,3.013,1.5603,4.2352,1.5291,0.9019,0.0728,0.0034,6.8056,4.1159,2.9968,6.0013,4.0819,0.6562,1.5596,0.0002,4.9887,2.9754,2.6652,1.7556,1.4134,0.5055,4.4003,3.5414,1.1591,8.4016,0.4788,1.4177,6.759,0.026,4.7957,3.0087]}

His work has inspired, and is a source of inspiration for, thousands of other writers.\n\nIn 1969, Garcia Marquez won the National Prize of Literature; in 1971, Columbia University awarded him an honorary doctorate. Garcia Marquez, whose real name is Gabriel Garcia M\u00e1rquez, has received numerous awards and distinctions, including France's Grand Prix du Meilleur Noveliste.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was born on 27 November 1931 in Aracataca, Colombia. In 1951, he began writing short stories, which were published in a number of literary magazines. He began writing novels while attending the Andres Bello Catholic University, where he graduated in 1953 with a degree in physics and in 1958 with a PhD in mathematics.\n\nIn addition to Garcia Marquez's own writings, his novels have also been adapted into a number of films or adapted for publication in other forms.

Head writer Chris Chibnall, who wrote the first two episodes of the new series, says, ``The title was chosen to reflect the ongoing mystery of the characters, and the fact that these characters are just beginning to find out who they are and what they really have to do on Earth. It also reflects the fact that all we know about the characters at the beginning of the series, and the series title, is day one. ``\n\nThe new series is based on the British series of the same name, and has two seasons. The initial two episodes of the new series deal with the characters' first day in their new lives on Earth. The title change was not expected by the cast or crew.\n\nThe original British series was set in space, but a third season of the American series has also been cast with people living on the ground (although that season will also have elements of space travel). The British series followed the lives of a group of people known as \"the five women,'' and the new series stars Max Greenfield (New Girl, Boston Legal, Step by Step), Zooey Deschanel, Lamorne Morris (New Girl), Emily L.

His first engagement, at the end of 1944, was at the village hall in Wroxeter, Shropshire. The local people got to know him well and he stayed for 18 months. He would make a very good impression and would be popular because of his good looks, comic timing and his friendly manner and generous spirit.\n\nFor the following nine years he returned to Wroxeter each year to entertain the local menfolk in the company of his wife, Olive.

{"id":3539,"ended":true,"length":289,"text":"Before the start of the voyage Nansen decided to deviate from his original plan : instead of following Jeannette's route to the New Siberian Islands by way of the Bering Strait, he would take the Northern Sea route, sailing south of the Siberian coast before turning round and heading homewards. The advantage of this approach is that it offers an attractive alternative for ships, if they find their way too hazardous to navigate through the Bering Strait (due to ice conditions). Nansen's choice was apparently based on his belief that the route was generally safe, and partly on a desire to avoid the ice of the Bering Strait.\n\nOn March 20, 1925, only two days from the mainland of the Russian Federation, Nansen set the course of his expedition ship Fram and headed for North Cape as though to turn to the northwest. The first two days of the voyage were uneventful, the weather was unseasonably fine and the navigation was straightforward. On the afternoon of March 24 the ship encountered rough conditions and was in danger of being swept into the ice, due to increased winds. The following day the Fram was swept by a heavy sea and a violent storm, which caused huge waves of up to 5 meters to crash against the ship and destroyed much of the infrastructure on board. Over the next 48 hours, the ship battled huge waves while suffering many casualties. However, the ship still managed to make it safely to the coast where it was refloated on March 27 after more than ten days at sea.","token_len":307,"entropy":[2.551,4.9311,0.0883,0.8961,9.1569,8.4475,6.3959,5.0097,0.2993,9.2074,0.1837,0.3134,1.4068,2.25,0.7052,8.9687,5.5598,0.2252,5.1757,10.264,3.6963,0.3511,0.9202,4.8835,2.1443,1.2534,6.0363,6.0297,3.9229,4.8357,2.6941,0.0007,1.3219,4.5092,1.3385,0.4955,0.3536,0.4481,2.7308,2.9752,1.3774,6.8865,2.5155,1.2319,2.1469,4.3391,3.2381,4.3334,0.8096,4.3575,3.7482,4.3984,3.3157,6.1432,1.9483,1.2591,11.6127,0.0235,2.957,1.6321,2.4565,8.5103,0.4477,1.0471,1.4203,2.4418,0.1176,1.551,5.0628,2.6942,6.6716,2.9429,2.4266,5.6394,5.2832,4.9657,1.2606,5.1807,3.8458,0.3805,4.6848,8.9616,1.4505,2.5399,3.3863,1.2737,5.4634,0.0199,0.0328,4.2211,5.0698,0.0735,4.2247,3.9689,1.1197,3.1261,0.0081,1.7741,5.5614,2.5456,6.3819,3.0339,0.1824,1.7806,2.7039,0.1259,1.3594,3.867,2.4439,6.5781,2.1088,1.4915,1.3766,8.1464,1.2884,3.1519,3.4272,0.1538,0.9865,2.0606,5.0239,4.274,0.5763,1.6742,0.0166,0.1562,0.8599,1.8237,0.1021,3.9984,4.159,3.3998,0.4699,5.7485,0.2924,7.2173,2.3148,0.742,6.3763,1.1274,9.6447,1.2702,2.0937,2.6909,0.3937,0.3584,0.6873,0.0096,4.903,6.1015,2.2207,2.1169,1.4248,3.9433,9.1075,12.5151,5.8913,3.0636,1.371,5.9116,6.6324,5.8463,7.7817,2.5801,5.4417,3.5192,0.9216,6.2303,0.7082,1.9326,3.3462,3.492,0.7814,1.2726,0.6705,1.0221,0.4643,6.3786,0.0338,0.0019,0.9205,4.348,3.8856,2.1963,6.1934,1.3642,0.0953,7.6615,1.2971,0.8605,6.3014,0.7624,3.8051,0.5502,2.6427,1.4959,4.4744,0.0522,0.2805,2.9409,2.8996,1.0507,4.6346,5.8112,1.9177,1.6432,2.7916,4.2842,2.6069,0.1106,1.7948,3.4709,2.4208,0.6933,1.8882,2.4962,5.6373,0.0508,6.4397,3.5872,0.7978,1.7049,4.0776,0.5074,1.444,6.0712,1.9115,3.8988,2.8721,1.2568,3.7753,5.8892,4.7613,4.0681,5.9726,1.5233,2.6287,1.5569,2.7819,6.2655,2.634,4.1456,3.9897,0.0032,4.0148,2.215,1.7228,5.0478,3.0465,0.2686,1.9159,2.2034,5.8078,4.2835,0.0377,0.2143,8.8235,1.9749,1.7086,0.1694,5.9317,0.4625,0.3825,5.1582,0.0112,1.5782,0.9393,0.7273,8.6938,8.3215,0.8984,5.0077,6.237,3.3219,2.8028,0.8395,5.1554,0.1783,1.5632,2.0219,5.4953,1.0178,0.0178,1.831,1.0127,3.4426,1.2292,0.485,3.1443,4.2313,0.7814,1.0285,6.2252,0.6312,0.0263,2.3491,1.3261,1.8473,4.1133,4.234,0.132,4.8156,0.6623,3.5955,0.0396,0.1844]}

{"id":371,"ended":true,"length":279,"text":"Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller undertook a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was on the north side, between the south range and the chapel (modern church). The walls are still largely visible, together with the gate of the curtain wall on the west, the gate of the chapel of the Holy Sepulchre on the west side, the southern ditch running roughly east-west, and the castle keep at the south-east corner.\n\nThe castle had two-arched doors on the castle towers and was probably entered through a narrow gateway on the north side. Inside were two ranges of corridors, each with three windows on each side, and three chambers. In one of the rooms to the east was a small door, which in the seventeenth century was a passage into the chapel. On a hill above the castle was the chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, which is now replaced with a small church containing both a nave and south porch.\n\nThe castle also had an outer wall which followed the contour of the hill and was built in stone only on the first three and a half towers. On the remaining towers the outer wall was built of earth and earthwork. Between the inner and the outer wall were a series of defences including bastions, an embankment and a ring wall. The castle is almost identical to other castles in the area being of similar date.","token_len":308,"entropy":[7.523,8.9285,0.5485,0.9068,6.8878,3.3209,6.7904,8.8479,0.7291,0.0039,0.5065,8.591,1.407,8.734,3.8419,4.3605,1.1288,2.9503,2.3474,1.711,6.7402,1.1929,6.7512,0.5578,1.5456,5.5731,7.1045,1.7641,8.7134,0.0123,0.051,8.711,4.6553,3.5066,8.7349,7.4664,5.9859,1.1543,5.0369,3.1432,1.2331,3.4882,0.8304,2.7236,0.6599,2.7709,5.0662,1.135,4.5615,9.6835,0.8232,0.2916,6.7795,4.3504,7.0802,4.8983,2.6344,1.0656,3.9478,4.026,5.0184,6.74,3.8032,1.9709,8.403,0.0212,0.8595,6.0214,3.222,0.2802,9.728,0.5167,3.7683,0.325,2.2947,3.2345,3.6672,3.2871,0.8691,0.1409,0.8421,4.9711,1.1939,3.6524,3.6252,0.0031,0.3476,0.0013,1.3182,0.0144,3.5213,3.2163,0.8122,1.3529,7.3293,9.7654,6.7797,7.6499,3.3536,2.2021,0.1385,1.9921,0.6723,0.499,4.8608,9.9951,2.6819,0.5841,1.4587,2.2131,1.1242,2.0067,0.949,1.5338,0.0354,1.118,2.2568,4.079,2.9138,7.0372,9.2436,0.4162,4.411,3.001,1.0085,7.2791,6.8131,2.4021,3.3475,5.8304,8.527,2.3235,1.8842,3.4106,5.4904,2.9834,0.4384,1.4589,0.8399,0.8483,5.0223,2.9203,1.8323,10.5027,0.3091,6.1911,1.3411,2.5394,1.6843,3.4444,4.5703,3.1918,1.6253,0.2008,1.5487,1.7356,3.0848,5.1153,1.7573,2.9469,2.9031,1.5286,0.6125,1.749,6.7056,0.2734,2.057,1.6734,0.3798,2.9093,4.1866,2.2263,1.7174,4.9147,1.4538,7.4689,0.0236,0.0543,1.2678,3.1905,5.0118,2.6346,0.5044,1.9912,1.5333,3.0212,4.153,6.2569,3.9252,0.5419,3.1595,1.4328,2.7523,1.5819,0.9899,0.792,1.6335,0.238,0.0007,0.0018,0.0005,1.1019,1.3096,2.927,1.9948,8.6092,2.9067,0.6427,3.321,3.2406,5.7715,5.9017,2.6706,7.6529,0.5736,0.1697,8.3647,7.2356,0.4168,1.6003,0.0001,0.9767,1.8819,4.187,0.6226,2.766,5.4794,1.789,2.7532,7.656,0.4215,8.3828,0.4374,0.0519,0.175,4.5395,2.3628,1.8951,3.9953,2.1769,5.3395,6.8857,2.6578,0.6042,5.0383,3.9539,4.8036,1.1436,0.0569,7.6491,1.0301,2.704,0.3561,7.1188,1.8095,1.654,4.0968,0.4099,0.7382,3.1908,2.1675,4.7701,1.3458,6.6057,3.3484,1.5301,5.1653,1.3796,5.5894,2.3214,4.3671,0.1754,2.3457,1.362,2.494,2.162,0.0023,8.1815,5.1293,9.1417,0.06,1.2808,4.8018,5.3869,0.0043,0.0059,1.573,0.8841,6.8573,3.4318,0.6316,1.2408,2.0175,3.8102,4.6685,4.0431,0.416,3.6738,1.5102,0.8665,1.0928,2.4643,7.4044,5.2074,3.9541,5.8416,1.5053]}

However, as always, make sure you are using a reliable horse breeder, who understands the qualities needed to bring out the best of both the horse and the rider.","token_len":309,"entropy":[11.0912,2.0869,3.6829,3.1528,1.8344,6.6411,2.095,0.0461,5.648,1.2807,3.4014,4.3912,8.3917,11.968,1.0734,4.4414,1.2868,1.9824,5.256,11.4448,0.0902,6.4314,4.7252,1.9717,6.9278,3.9616,4.9148,10.0095,3.5212,0.0023,3.7922,1.9948,1.9478,3.5469,8.8334,2.7924,5.5513,7.2386,3.2049,1.1212,6.3575,1.7452,5.0198,0.0391,4.6213,4.9362,0.34,0.9676,5.5993,3.2626,7.5051,1.6674,5.9898,5.2397,0.0188,3.9887,3.5797,0.6606,4.5802,3.6871,3.0044,2.1637,3.7857,4.3302,5.2356,5.2677,0.1439,3.0681,3.8942,7.9744,3.8938,3.381,3.3604,8.1823,0.5273,0.9913,0.0015,3.6269,6.1454,0.0072,0.9108,4.9083,0.9221,0.0275,3.0407,6.5831,1.9038,1.7954,1.7019,1.8185,4.3128,0.5182,2.3169,0.389,5.1283,0.7746,3.2495,7.2829,0.0024,0.0037,0.3098,0.7146,1.97,0.2217,0.15,3.9721,3.5146,3.5379,4.7902,4.456,1.5468,0.3707,0.0722,5.8318,0.5204,3.2264,3.5969,0.049,1.1149,5.7197,0.2372,1.5148,2.8218,0.1799,1.8816,6.3145,2.5272,1.9374,0.5997,4.6356,0.1205,6.4433,1.3604,0.3491,1.4753,0.9309,0.892,7.2413,0.3746,4.1409,1.8627,2.6545,1.3876,0.0144,0.888,2.6511,4.6576,0.0214,7.7705,6.7365,2.9174,3.7913,4.263,0.5517,6.1585,6.636,1.107,0.0003,2.3284,6.0847,0.2581,1.7664,5.4402,2.3681,1.2241,0.0117,0.0127,3.2639,4.5173,1.3328,3.5695,0.3785,1.243,1.9601,1.8577,0.1624,3.3029,0.159,13.4249,7.055,4.6813,6.6106,1.3283,8.9661,1.7194,2.2536,2.7716,3.6049,0.306,0.0242,2.2318,6.9223,1.5286,5.1422,0.0597,4.1831,0.7283,1.6292,2.031,5.1135,0.0171,0.0439,0.169,0.3683,4.9613,1.2382,5.8789,0.1916,4.5493,0.9704,2.7008,2.3693,5.33,1.6029,4.5616,2.3052,3.9522,0.8877,6.1432,0.1326,3.9029,6.9587,0.0097,1.6111,5.2475,0.0385,1.8789,0.5017,0.4554,0.7571,0.0002,6.3132,1.5707,2.8711,0.7805,4.6663,0.8186,3.1812,4.3599,5.9513,1.3635,3.3359,1.523,1.805,9.0678,3.1158,3.5562,1.0493,7.6179,4.2123,2.7036,0.2491,3.5479,0.7658,1.8308,0.8601,3.9339,2.4635,3.8046,4.0784,6.657,1.9571,2.7924,5.5962,0.6137,0.9497,1.6974,2.7094,3.1987,0.5819,1.7241,3.9253,6.1925,1.0059,4.6616,0.0286,3.9572,4.8737,0.1909,5.4681,0.0396,3.5775,1.8505,2.9782,2.044,4.5569,0.6584,8.5551,0.0053,2.1842,2.4978,4.7279,0.6126,7.5108,4.9906,0.5593,3.9614,3.9328,0.4071,0.7915,2.1278,4.3995,2.4136,0.7575,0.2273,0.7689,0.9706,0.2867]}

{"id":3566,"ended":true,"length":283,"text":"The most influential of the contemporary reports came from Citizen Boullemer, and was published in over 1000 pamphlets later in the year. Boullemer claimed to be among the few surviving eyewitnesses : ``My father [had] been one of the four thousand who had been sent by Colonel Maitland to assist the Duke, and he himself was among the first on the scene,... having been first through the streets, and being the first to cut down the barricades; and I saw the Duke himself, and the Duke who escaped, both lying among the bodies and wounded. It is my duty to explain to the people that it was not through any fault of my own, but as circumstances were, that I had left the Duke unprotected.''\n\nThe reports had the opposite effect because the Duke of Cumberland was considered as not only a great general but one who has achieved a certain moral authority. As the English forces pushed forward during the second half of the 18th century, they were often accompanied by popular bands and public meetings in which the soldiers were treated as heroes and were exhorted to ``remember the Prince Regent and his generous purpose'' with a great enthusiasm. Not all of such reports could be true, but even if they were, their effect was to confirm the public opinion that the Duke had indeed fought a just war.\n\nThis was further confirmed as the French retreated under the attacks of their countrymen and their foreign allies at Malplaquet, Wavre, Oradour and Reims.","token_len":309,"entropy":[5.8798,5.5593,3.1745,1.3434,7.2774,7.7593,5.8316,0.2931,10.5798,9.914,7.0565,4.8117,9.888,0.4184,5.4329,2.8089,2.0533,0.5471,10.0285,4.6769,7.986,0.0008,9.1943,1.6502,0.706,1.3639,0.4064,5.0546,0.0025,0.0046,0.0037,4.2922,2.2008,2.2219,5.8593,0.3152,3.9066,5.558,5.4603,0.0728,11.4559,10.4146,5.3725,2.4941,6.6654,6.3816,1.149,1.9238,4.8659,0.0838,0.3194,5.6134,5.1576,1.7882,2.4225,1.8712,3.5295,2.4009,5.2177,5.5262,5.9154,0.3423,0.5706,3.7801,1.6362,7.071,4.1979,1.3623,2.4843,5.0253,1.4929,3.7444,0.6165,2.7377,5.5099,0.6796,1.1091,8.8029,8.7582,1.5389,6.1317,6.5102,0.6014,4.0987,1.9954,1.2508,4.5513,4.3131,0.7205,0.8078,7.5442,2.2955,0.9867,4.0939,0.2074,5.433,1.4111,3.5729,4.2118,2.2352,2.3987,4.8915,1.9128,1.8564,2.6505,2.2833,5.5132,7.9259,1.7347,7.0373,4.6795,5.6956,0.3239,4.8047,3.4433,5.0245,2.0542,3.1799,1.614,4.7899,3.2967,0.4013,4.6563,1.3037,1.6739,2.4695,2.4034,3.2386,0.9121,2.3811,6.4171,3.0573,3.7705,0.0486,2.8539,0.867,0.9941,0.8921,4.4733,7.6516,2.5013,1.2666,1.6474,1.518,2.8,4.5426,1.4383,2.8014,8.3912,2.9799,2.5649,0.0432,1.9855,4.6296,4.6456,3.7979,6.132,0.2929,6.1602,2.2446,2.1215,3.56,4.6815,0.0132,1.2455,5.1401,2.9655,5.6559,1.846,1.1735,4.1587,4.4433,1.3045,3.7239,2.101,7.0592,5.5734,2.7516,3.3624,5.2242,4.523,1.1734,4.0885,2.494,4.4831,6.8263,6.459,2.1265,4.7386,0.1618,4.2709,1.3834,0.0036,0.2889,3.7532,0.2867,0.1618,0.3236,2.2257,1.7407,4.6209,5.0047,0.0354,8.4588,8.3831,2.7159,5.0679,4.0626,3.1575,1.0352,1.7088,4.5189,1.9534,4.5292,1.1252,3.3036,1.9011,3.8758,9.0232,0.008,0.1846,8.2888,6.0885,1.2407,6.4081,7.9979,0.1331,2.4144,1.5107,6.7712,7.5537,3.108,5.1731,2.0883,4.0955,3.5488,0.3295,6.3484,3.2447,1.0919,7.4653,4.8671,4.9509,0.4437,3.6383,1.0015,1.2933,4.9091,3.2205,0.6677,0.3589,1.3118,3.2579,3.4797,0.8594,2.2818,4.7825,0.7796,4.4892,1.1477,1.0096,0.8821,0.6655,2.2598,4.6888,5.4758,2.7396,8.0235,0.6402,0.8586,1.0287,0.0002,4.0889,2.1467,5.8832,1.6824,5.2732,1.1457,4.6232,6.5281,4.9643,0.8726,8.4795,0.0484,4.8878,6.856,0.038,2.3468,3.1674,6.4514,2.0251,4.1708,6.7884,6.7822,1.7645,6.6768,1.5401,7.0751,6.3891,1.7218,0.9712,6.4412,6.5826,1.6639,1.1609,6.5866,0.3204,0.5988]}

Although Raffles is mentioned in the first story, the third has never been identified, and it is doubtful that it is one of Raffles's.\n\nThe first two appear to be based on historical events, but they were not written as such. Indeed, the `` gallant sailor \"` story is probably based on the career of Nelson. In the second story, Raffles does not escape entanglements; he has them and makes good : `` As we all know by this time, he is now Commander of the East India Squadron and Vice-Admiral and that is in itself a pretty good career ``. The last story refers to the romantic love of an `` Oriental prince \" ` who, in fact, had been a member of the court of the sultan and prince of Brunei. Both he and the sultan have been subjects of the British East India Company. The romance developed between the sultan and the sultan's beautiful favourite, who was also a foreigner. She eloped with the prince at a time when their relationship might have attracted considerable attention.","token_len":309,"entropy":[9.8277,12.6576,4.809,5.6053,8.0233,3.3574,5.327,0.2227,7.8317,8.1584,9.3341,7.0911,10.8226,8.0836,8.5964,0.4082,1.1562,4.5524,8.5824,5.1224,4.5673,4.9046,0.3319,4.5063,0.121,9.4053,6.7934,2.3718,7.7282,4.486,0.1373,0.1005,2.1332,0.6866,5.887,1.8182,8.578,1.3258,4.9759,1.2064,2.6609,2.8926,8.4531,1.3203,0.8893,5.5259,0.0836,2.3357,0.7507,0.3882,8.2414,6.7257,0.3522,2.2591,5.5845,11.2734,0.3191,4.7207,3.1093,0.4135,6.4822,2.2021,8.018,1.319,2.1384,5.9741,2.2744,0.4808,3.3312,1.8698,1.6541,2.8786,4.57,1.5099,7.0742,5.4734,0.4293,3.6098,1.4065,5.0964,5.6013,1.6361,4.6298,2.1855,2.4596,2.5825,9.6424,4.6,1.493,1.395,5.7609,1.7742,0.5228,2.1179,7.7886,1.3327,1.5961,2.5708,4.9503,0.5831,1.704,3.8564,3.9011,3.9093,0.1822,4.3083,2.1124,0.9566,2.3754,0.6968,3.9429,1.4706,2.3618,1.4871,4.4888,0.2478,3.2136,0.0172,0.7961,1.5586,2.7045,0.0419,1.943,1.9859,3.8026,7.3362,1.1524,0.6645,4.8268,0.2558,5.7415,2.8336,1.1955,2.2679,2.5926,3.2005,1.6252,3.4022,3.0794,2.8683,0.7336,5.55,0.0727,1.7427,5.3038,6.5686,0.1131,0.3307,2.1069,9.7984,4.5359,1.4386,3.9788,3.1186,0.187,1.4937,7.9848,1.1491,9.2896,4.7336,2.7071,1.4944,1.656,0.2583,0.3083,1.1453,0.0232,4.9594,0.4249,1.9566,7.6133,0.1753,0.0367,3.7617,1.1793,3.9754,7.6783,3.7112,4.3782,4.3064,12.7723,1.0805,5.9778,3.6572,3.6249,0.3077,4.3283,4.5681,1.0062,0.8571,3.175,1.8348,4.1669,8.3014,0.4651,0.2851,5.318,0.7469,6.1675,2.4901,7.3386,1.1659,0.7468,0.0018,0.0021,4.9405,5.1357,1.565,5.2233,5.7645,0.9592,4.2674,1.0636,2.9316,8.3361,0.4921,1.297,4.0635,2.1287,5.3715,0.1516,1.3642,5.6848,0.841,2.47,2.6394,2.6249,1.9684,0.1292,2.1436,5.773,2.7056,2.8438,1.8886,3.2268,0.0073,3.3401,1.7873,2.2638,3.1462,0.0183,0.3,7.881,0.4063,1.3531,8.0342,0.1992,3.0109,6.4096,1.6162,5.1947,0.0653,1.0787,4.7658,7.4611,0.0713,1.5507,4.301,0.0088,2.6086,1.6265,7.1975,0.1529,1.3188,3.3197,5.3977,0.0514,0.6334,1.7288,2.0649,5.8058,7.8321,3.4732,1.7204,3.0309,0.0219,0.1077,0.7744,2.763,0.0712,1.9594,7.752,11.6782,1.1194,3.4072,1.7813,3.5295,1.112,7.2168,1.1498,5.2272,9.2733,0.5461,0.7484,1.2937,1.7907,3.6094,2.0477,3.453,0.1133,4.6328,1.6217,5.7168,0.5345,6.851,3.5333,0.9267,0.7289]}

The male begins raising his wing feathers within a few days of approach and may approach multiple females in the same day.\n\nThe birds will moult to appear darker, and once mate selected, both remain present in the nest. Breeding will then occur intermittently from approximately July until the birds have had two or three broods of one to five young to fledge. After they have fledged, the male and female will leave the vicinity.

{"id":1201,"ended":true,"length":276,"text":"In 1964, Simone changed record distributors from the American Colpix to the Dutch Philips, which also meant a change in the contents of her recordings. She had always included songs in her repertoire that were on the lips of the people. Now she was given the chance to interpret, sing and arrange those songs, while continuing to present her own work in a fresh, original way. Some of the new songs have a Caribbean rhythmic influence (Calle del Caribe). Other songs are based on ancient melodies (Puesto en la Calle), with new lyrics. Others combine traditional folk tunes with modern, new-age songs. Some of Simone's songs are as simple and direct as her songs of the Thirties were, while others display her talents as a lyricist and composer as much as as a singer. In 1964, one song has words and music by Jean Jacques Rousseau and is called Piazzetta. Another, Bailamos!, written by Joan Pons (Pons is a popular writer in both languages); was inspired by a poem by Garcia Lorca. In 1963, Simone was invited to give a radio performance on Radio Caracas. A series of performances, some with orchestral accompaniment and others with the folk ensemble La Cuna de Maroeta, were held throughout the country. Some of the songs in this volume were recorded in this manner. In 1964, the first two of these radio sessions were released in Venezuela as Tres M\u00fasicas y una Orquesta.","token_len":310,"entropy":[10.682,0.2297,10.6284,8.5446,11.8593,9.6482,2.5204,2.8206,4.3331,7.5196,7.4078,6.5765,1.4192,0.9027,6.234,6.1839,1.9332,2.4328,4.1666,6.1398,3.1067,3.0186,0.3308,0.964,8.93,0.1503,6.7685,4.8159,0.2985,2.4302,3.1214,4.3955,6.5518,4.5188,1.6452,0.5435,3.6931,3.1113,1.3042,5.2078,1.0741,7.9163,0.1571,1.7718,3.0757,2.9808,4.5859,1.5108,1.9331,6.4358,1.2196,3.4493,0.1257,7.7439,4.382,5.4624,0.9182,5.8838,3.4748,0.2928,1.9248,4.5847,5.3358,0.3499,4.9428,1.7102,1.7618,3.7409,2.1483,1.4241,6.1944,1.8106,2.9795,0.9558,0.223,6.0853,0.4486,1.1866,4.2127,1.7463,3.3409,3.0713,10.8619,9.4689,0.0002,5.1227,3.9633,5.0126,5.6809,7.1485,6.1688,0.0242,3.8589,3.7206,0.8011,1.6065,4.0702,0.1686,6.1505,4.0938,2.4412,3.7548,4.0267,3.8398,1.652,6.2385,3.685,6.0052,1.1632,2.2555,3.4655,4.9217,2.7631,2.8416,5.2366,6.3419,2.7733,3.6972,4.1498,0.6817,2.0622,3.3661,3.6082,3.0433,3.0502,2.9393,0.7378,3.1023,0.9626,3.7155,0.0126,1.0722,1.0714,5.5599,3.6462,2.5589,5.4516,0.0629,2.1435,3.8289,2.801,1.1418,8.5076,1.5356,0.0066,5.6438,1.6935,2.269,0.259,7.65,3.6041,5.5887,1.5977,0.413,3.4799,0.0396,1.6137,2.2854,4.76,4.1275,0.0324,4.4491,0.5035,2.558,0.4639,3.0206,3.5011,0.4151,5.6826,3.6406,4.6677,7.7583,2.9686,4.1237,5.6901,6.0769,5.0455,3.0965,0.0153,2.8952,3.954,1.8018,5.2946,4.0577,3.8071,3.5819,1.4081,3.3915,2.0682,6.6558,6.4353,6.9151,5.184,6.5538,6.7445,1.0744,5.3128,4.5526,8.5024,2.9713,4.2687,6.8504,2.793,1.6822,4.895,3.8778,1.5809,5.9303,6.0086,5.2609,3.2323,3.9336,0.0856,2.4419,2.3521,0.7027,10.3282,8.1427,0.7002,1.6036,2.3887,4.1724,0.2353,0.9168,2.5003,2.6627,0.1622,4.5494,0.5654,6.5026,1.9768,3.019,3.7029,6.803,2.8027,1.315,4.1206,5.8832,0.0145,3.9312,2.5853,4.1732,2.9813,7.4178,0.0146,0.0,1.0312,0.2368,2.3498,1.4546,0.4039,3.5326,6.5833,6.2459,6.7129,4.164,5.3151,2.2036,5.5732,4.9391,6.3072,0.4672,1.3817,1.4411,4.4416,0.2245,2.1653,0.5051,4.8206,0.4783,0.66,1.2326,3.2217,1.2799,5.8528,1.3586,3.1743,1.4496,5.7773,4.7259,1.2124,2.5336,1.5517,0.1587,2.3201,3.1727,3.766,3.4055,1.5929,5.1722,5.1229,0.4813,4.935,1.9502,5.7223,3.841,5.6376,3.8232,4.4866,4.5161,7.2991,2.2167,5.3911,6.5758,1.7991,7.6628,7.3021,1.028,1.3833]}
{"id":3525,"ended":true,"length":290,"text":"Bonnet is alleged to have been one of the few pirates to make his prisoners walk the plank. No contemporary source makes any mention of Bonnet forcing prisoners to walk the plank, and the story of the French Navy having ordered it is not credible. More plausible is that the story was included in the story, along with a raft that was towed along-side, so that the pirates would \"set sail\" (i.e. leave the ship) on the raft. The raft would apparently be manned by pirates who surrendered themselves to the Royal Navy and were consequently pardoned.\n\nThe story of the \"discovery\" of the French ship is also not credible. The ship was anchored near the mouth of the River Gambia, probably lying there awaiting its final destination. In any case, its captors never saw it, for Captain Aveline was on shore at a trading post. The French were a \"sea race\", and certainly knew more than anyone else in the world about sea navigation and had no need of such devices. It is probable that the story refers instead to the practice of \"pushing\" ships onto the beach in order to stop them, or possibly for insurance purposes - although this would imply that the ship was anchored in a particularly vulnerable location\n\nAnother story tells that one of Bonnet's lieutenants was executed in 1722, along with his entire crew, after an unsuccessful attack on the Portuguese. This story is not mentioned in any of the contemporary sources and therefore has to be considered of doubtful authenticity.","token_len":310,"entropy":[7.7809,4.4811,9.4378,0.0238,0.1073,2.3748,4.4422,0.0146,0.5583,3.7209,7.4631,1.9533,3.5441,3.1252,10.5805,6.1255,3.8395,1.2456,1.6345,6.0755,8.7171,4.7078,4.4146,1.3024,0.675,0.0201,8.8278,0.0057,8.8435,3.1512,0.2353,1.3892,0.7444,0.0114,1.5672,2.3875,2.4324,4.2047,1.9324,1.4576,6.7238,5.9516,5.1046,5.3275,4.0989,1.7431,2.2809,5.6116,0.3106,6.3818,5.0544,0.9011,1.1807,1.7064,3.404,1.1747,8.2212,0.3806,0.974,4.4217,4.4905,4.8516,0.0112,2.0413,7.2655,3.356,2.1197,5.298,3.0829,9.2944,1.9431,4.2367,3.5374,0.3824,1.3778,2.7544,1.9135,6.3323,6.4673,1.4507,1.5102,4.6764,4.2172,0.001,0.0005,1.377,3.7874,1.0253,2.9992,2.2557,3.1228,1.0389,5.8495,1.0346,2.2283,4.4463,2.6124,6.7668,1.906,6.2308,0.1548,3.3836,1.5707,9.1607,3.3025,0.737,0.8759,5.2057,0.1861,2.4913,1.9498,7.6818,7.3814,0.0002,0.8813,1.3144,0.0178,1.7839,2.4319,1.0368,0.7075,4.0756,5.5535,2.0572,0.3405,0.3201,0.765,3.9298,3.9159,2.1285,2.3322,2.8573,2.3196,0.5722,1.4847,3.7463,1.1371,7.184,2.7886,1.3543,4.4233,0.017,0.5545,3.1484,7.8412,1.5489,1.1249,5.3742,6.4822,5.3267,5.2445,3.192,5.1335,2.6547,0.5221,3.3311,3.4962,1.17,0.0678,5.3493,6.1169,0.4015,4.3862,2.4079,0.7108,1.5576,5.7655,6.2022,5.6868,5.0589,1.4431,3.4282,3.9536,4.2759,1.8172,4.4481,8.7264,0.2291,2.25,1.8972,2.5571,2.9129,5.6569,4.7329,5.1351,2.9991,2.5071,1.3068,6.3249,4.5207,5.2617,2.0231,2.8955,0.8657,4.2774,0.4254,2.2459,0.7992,4.6424,5.3282,2.6674,4.4321,2.8662,3.3899,1.6988,3.5371,5.7898,0.438,3.1692,1.0209,4.3488,0.1953,1.1846,4.7191,8.6708,6.4876,0.0186,0.9769,7.5325,0.1106,2.933,4.7099,3.5176,0.7925,3.9836,4.7792,0.8022,4.1254,3.4352,0.7657,0.0099,5.3619,0.6145,3.1117,2.5273,4.2297,5.1286,8.7777,1.5202,5.9855,4.0422,1.84,2.3647,5.2296,0.471,0.8765,3.89,1.0666,4.9854,1.8903,1.3471,6.6117,3.7018,2.7285,8.7424,0.0002,4.7118,3.8481,5.2431,2.7456,4.3813,0.3488,1.8743,0.011,0.0108,6.7157,0.0001,0.0001,1.6745,5.3245,2.6712,2.8673,4.823,1.6746,4.7682,0.0128,1.7375,5.887,0.5472,1.9324,2.8097,3.956,2.9326,4.228,0.6016,1.1104,5.4845,2.5027,2.3188,1.6171,1.1309,2.215,4.3588,0.696,1.2282,1.4712,0.1766,5.5229,1.4019,3.8079,4.589,3.5055,4.0218,0.2329,2.9324,6.492,2.3699,1.8862,0.2485]}
{"id":615,"ended":true,"length":288,"text":"The Food Album has received mixed reviews from most critics ; many felt that while the album was amusing it was not an essential release. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of five stars, saying \"The album is consistently entertaining, a kind of audio cross between the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, and Wipeout\". Music critic, Richard Goldstein, who reviewed \"A New Way To Eat\" for Salon.com, wrote that the album \"provides the occasional funny nugget\", but that \"the overall mood is decidedly mixed\". At the time of the album's release, Rolling Stone was of the opinion that \"If you're looking for quality gags and skits (or even skittles that have had the flavor whacked off of them) as much as anything to laugh at, 'The Food Album' goes a long way to meeting that craving\".\n\nBy October 1995, the album had charted in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 39 on the UK Albums Chart.

The majority of Barker s work, however, was never exhibited. The majority of what is known about Barker s artwork is due to an article in the The British magazine in which an acquaintance of Barker s explained that she was more interested in capturing the essence of the child not the child s outward appearance, thus much of her work was done in black and white.\n\nThe artist also became a patron and patroness of Victorian art and painting, particularly early Impressionist work. Barker was so well versed in French literature that the term of courtesy employed in her letters was a French phrase as was her choice to use it. Barker died from breast cancer on February 12 at a private sanatorium in Pinner a suburb of north west London. Barker was survived by five sisters, among them, the painter, artist and curator, Barbara Barker who served as a consultant in Barker s archives. Barker also had an adopted daughter, Mary Katherine Treworgy who was born in 1887. Mary Katherine Treworgy became a prominent journalist and political commentator particularly during her time as editor of the British Magazine where Treworgy developed a reputation for being fiercely opposed to the imperial measures of the governments of the British Empire. She later worked for the Independent Newspaper, editing various sections including the Sunday and Weekly Divisions until her retirement in 1953.","token_len":310,"entropy":[8.4894,1.2897,2.4629,10.6815,2.7361,6.2809,0.656,0.9552,3.7311,3.6745,5.9151,3.4911,5.3851,0.5816,6.7829,4.772,3.5405,2.3836,4.7168,0.6841,1.3037,5.4766,2.2051,11.0656,0.3772,5.5821,3.1606,2.3838,7.5431,10.4029,3.8454,1.4991,3.2631,5.0207,5.9285,4.0378,4.1407,1.4428,1.4754,0.3386,2.4517,6.2297,0.0588,4.1956,9.3552,2.0097,2.8164,1.7869,0.0017,0.6805,3.4378,2.4329,2.0688,2.5602,4.4355,0.1368,5.8507,2.5706,1.0724,1.1327,0.5721,0.3215,5.0236,0.963,3.7132,0.1702,3.5164,4.0831,1.0668,0.9153,5.5279,6.1328,7.4113,4.7397,4.6114,4.751,4.6894,0.7678,1.1438,0.3695,6.8271,1.0807,3.2863,1.8625,6.5799,0.5743,0.0362,8.1494,1.0558,3.8669,0.0557,1.5684,3.644,8.2449,2.059,3.5148,6.7975,9.1369,0.5237,1.0574,6.3103,6.9267,1.9837,1.4865,0.7906,1.0628,4.0816,1.5088,4.8329,0.238,0.019,0.8158,2.1652,0.0072,2.2395,3.6357,3.7916,5.1558,1.8148,5.4861,2.1671,3.7631,1.9448,0.076,8.1147,3.0165,2.2302,4.9139,1.3113,4.0617,5.8934,8.309,0.0035,1.4378,2.9994,1.3611,2.1691,2.8078,5.0554,3.4762,4.4025,0.0007,0.1065,5.9671,4.4217,0.9062,3.7357,4.9951,5.8324,10.2051,6.4077,1.5448,1.2343,3.7037,1.7696,3.3689,4.5929,3.1623,5.907,5.1274,3.0843,6.6935,1.9861,1.0541,1.4512,1.6939,2.4909,6.1495,4.617,5.4658,0.0098,2.2874,3.0633,3.3909,8.7969,3.8437,3.2969,8.9765,0.3756,0.4844,5.4486,5.8123,8.6733,4.9518,0.0628,8.1107,5.9285,0.1576,0.5101,2.3165,1.6865,4.4788,0.0101,4.5877,3.6023,0.9341,8.6442,0.4476,4.0956,4.438,5.4378,2.8177,4.4296,2.5001,4.9834,1.6738,5.0137,3.2071,6.1409,5.199,0.1821,2.1479,4.5434,3.1269,4.3963,0.4594,5.489,0.9702,2.1676,3.1596,2.5548,2.7434,6.2825,1.0801,0.5186,3.5281,7.317,6.7008,4.9541,7.7099,7.1218,3.3651,1.4092,1.521,1.2367,2.7076,4.1506,0.8592,4.2693,1.0564,0.7622,0.0009,0.0008,0.0017,4.5822,1.0671,4.8568,6.2682,1.1115,4.5538,2.4985,9.6152,1.4825,2.0336,1.5926,0.8853,2.1327,0.3403,0.8198,3.3483,5.5515,6.9906,8.2301,0.006,0.0015,0.001,7.1322,1.0475,1.4748,0.4166,2.7145,6.8688,3.7476,0.0167,1.0766,6.2061,7.1812,1.3645,1.049,6.7126,0.4119,1.6443,3.6794,0.305,0.3454,2.6324,3.7362,3.6306,1.1986,0.7165,5.9338,4.1994,4.6209,9.5414,5.5667,4.1129,5.0843,1.0187,3.6175,5.7128,4.6073,10.6698,0.8759,6.1943,1.2992,2.8503,0.5059,4.2269,0.2721]}
{"id":3115,"ended":true,"length":277,"text":"`` A Fool in Love `` was released in July 1960 and became an immediate hit, peaking at number 2 on the Hot R & B Sides chart and number 27 on the Billboard chart. The single received a Grammy Award nomination.\n\nThe song was produced by the legendary producer Phil Spector, who was working with Ike and Tina Turner on their fifth album, ``They'' and was released as a single to promote the album.\n\nIke recorded the song for Phil Spector after seeing it performed by Dionne Warwick, the title track of `The Bells of Rhymney` and the previous year. Phil had arranged for Dionne to perform two songs for him at the Phil Spector House on Waverly Place in Los Angeles in March 1960. Once there, Dionne told Phil to turn up the rock instrumentation in his song and turn her own song into something more R&B.

In turn, Ike and Tina Turner later featured Ike on their hit single ``River Deep Mountain High.``\n\nIn the years since its first publication, ``A Fool in Love`` has become one of the best known of all pop standards. Over the years, it has been recorded by artists as varied as Dionne Warwick, Shirley Bassey, Ray Charles, Paul Anka, Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin, Barry Manilow, Frank Sinatra, Elton John and Johnny Cash.","token_len":310,"entropy":[6.7319,11.1762,3.4018,3.719,11.407,6.7494,3.4482,1.2263,4.2098,6.4112,2.2169,2.976,2.6723,5.7716,0.626,2.5072,7.2749,0.0262,0.0748,1.6608,3.5711,0.5196,0.1752,4.2117,5.7772,6.7044,0.8139,9.5421,5.5653,1.7113,2.4997,2.6452,6.1219,0.2705,0.3187,1.7322,3.5345,0.5849,1.6673,4.0793,4.3374,1.7681,3.0291,1.1801,1.0943,3.0619,2.3436,0.0049,2.2969,1.885,1.2786,4.5113,0.3273,3.5452,3.6761,3.411,5.2598,1.2676,0.0012,1.1832,0.6556,2.0228,5.9152,1.3796,9.2619,2.8653,0.3972,0.3358,0.9177,2.5091,8.3921,0.6243,0.6514,7.7704,6.194,5.8816,1.4737,1.8926,2.1118,3.1046,0.8996,0.6961,5.5096,4.0165,1.0798,1.2875,0.6456,1.678,0.0003,6.1976,0.0382,6.238,0.7206,0.5543,2.1378,6.2514,0.2476,0.0022,4.306,3.3187,2.3089,3.1633,1.659,10.5549,0.6858,0.0212,2.0585,2.48,6.6132,1.1464,1.6114,6.425,1.917,6.461,0.4865,2.1463,8.0048,3.9254,1.1506,4.5562,1.4752,1.4929,6.5392,5.1414,6.1398,5.7021,3.895,5.7756,1.1075,5.9782,0.0049,0.172,0.9941,5.6406,1.6047,1.2662,0.8203,2.5189,0.866,6.8647,0.0163,0.0176,5.421,3.1435,5.8574,1.9064,0.251,2.3737,0.9516,3.5236,0.0038,2.4035,4.1812,2.5574,0.5328,6.4229,3.0095,0.1934,2.6315,0.0003,3.3293,3.0527,2.9103,5.2703,2.2286,1.3219,9.789,8.7209,1.7558,2.9543,1.7397,4.5054,1.7439,6.0122,6.7191,6.368,3.8504,1.535,5.7667,2.4707,8.0971,0.0683,0.0007,1.2135,3.0675,6.8609,2.0183,1.1974,0.0003,5.0605,2.4787,5.0219,8.1897,0.3666,7.7306,0.3581,2.4786,0.5795,0.6852,1.3191,2.0962,5.0814,3.2605,6.9172,4.4831,1.0218,3.7438,1.3753,3.27,5.926,0.0613,2.2598,2.2631,1.0303,0.7846,6.7141,5.8782,4.2359,1.1748,1.4494,3.5231,2.5245,1.0235,8.3614,9.8499,8.9162,5.4999,3.9198,2.8314,1.2049,0.0003,2.4748,2.4071,3.7453,2.2292,4.1368,5.066,5.0388,0.228,1.966,3.613,0.0371,0.1234,0.0014,2.0627,0.3408,1.3426,1.7069,0.0047,0.1461,3.3169,4.8645,6.1173,2.1422,2.9007,10.0681,0.8932,5.4587,0.7812,0.5673,0.1615,1.1296,0.3067,1.6215,4.9969,2.0922,4.9017,3.4984,1.3553,0.0256,7.3485,0.0019,0.2913,0.2132,6.2296,1.9423,0.0075,0.2252,4.9545,0.2547,0.2448,4.6782,7.0205,0.0758,0.343,4.3831,0.7662,0.0005,0.2595,9.0098,0.0016,0.0002,0.2329,6.716,0.3154,0.0004,0.0002,0.1871,4.8383,0.196,0.0,0.2185,4.9149,0.1077,0.001,1.8496,4.7876,0.356,0.1896]}

On the other hand, the fishery in French Guiana has declined by about 70% while the two main off-shore commercial fishery areas in the South Atlantic, the Brazilian coast ( including the northeast coast of the country ) and the South African coast, both appear to be stable or may even be recovering, in comparison to the early 20th century and to the 1970 s and early 1980 s.\n\nIn both regions, the fishing gear is either gill nets or set nets, but the use of dusky sharks as bait has not been a major factor as to the decline in the fishery. However, in parts of the Brazilian coast, off-shore fishing with bait using set nets is the main source of income for small boats and many commercial fishing is by small boats with very small crew. These small boats are also very heavily overfished. The use of gill nets has been strongly limited in some countries where these fisheries are controlled by fisheries management organisations ( some fisheries are also managed by regional and sub-regional fisheries management organisations.\n\nCopper sharks are also caught by some recreational fishers in many countries, especially Australia ( which is their main home ) but also South Africa, New Zealand and France.

{"id":4636,"ended":true,"length":264,"text":"This tropical depression formed in the Bay of Campeche on August 26 and moved slowly northwest, moving ashore northeast Mexico on August 29 and into the United States on August 30. As an upper level center, the system affected the US Gulf Coast states, resulting in life-threatening, deadly flooding along Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama. An estimated 100 deaths, many from floods, were blamed on Gustav. The system was blamed for $4 billion in insured losses. Gustav forced the closure of 1,275 miles of Gulf Coast oil and gas production and refining.\n\nAt 1800 UTC, the tropical cyclone was centered near 25.8\u00b0N, 99.0\u00b0W about 790 miles (1,260 km) south-southwest of Cozumel, Mexico. The depression was moving to the northwest near 3 mph (6 km\/h). Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 30 mph (45 km\/h) with higher gusts.\n\nGustav is the eighth tropical cyclone in the 2008 Northern Hemisphere spring season and the seventeenth tropical cyclone worldwide. Tropical cyclone activity has been above the long-term average for the season. A series of tropical cyclones and tropical storm watches and warnings have been in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean.

{"id":4224,"ended":true,"length":251,"text":"Paradoxical reactions, such as increased seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition and the subsequent increase of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine production. Pharmacological suppression of these neurotransmitters has successfully reversed the phenomena of drug induced psychoses. An alternative explanation is that the drug is an excitotoxin, a neuro-biological substance capable of producing neuropathological effects by binding to receptor sites for dopamine, serotonin, calcium channels, and glycine. There are a class of excitotoxicity and neuro-pathogenetic mechanisms that can cause these reactions. The drug may also act directly on brain cellular structures through changes in the permeability of the blood brain barrier. In this view, excitotoxin acts by damaging the neuronal membranes in the brain and leading to a variety of degenerative processes. The drug also activates the serotonergic and norepinephritic systems.\n\nIt is important to note that psychiatric medications do not directly produce the neuropathological effects described above. However there is strong evidence that they can enhance and induce psychiatric reactions, or exacerbate preexisting psychiatric disorders. Psychiatric reactions to psychotropic drugs and neuropsychopharmacological therapies may be clinically and psychophysiologically significant. They may present clinically as drug related effects which may be manifested as an increase in morbidity or mortality. The potential risk factors for neuropsychiatric reactions to psychiatric medicines have previously been described.","token_len":311,"entropy":[6.4408,1.6619,3.8388,6.439,2.9398,1.4982,0.0047,5.3262,6.7431,4.0975,3.1795,1.5461,0.4183,0.6469,8.5851,0.627,7.5921,0.4792,6.1412,0.3762,0.3795,4.4538,0.0236,2.0332,4.6514,3.024,8.1668,1.8319,1.3182,3.1614,1.8681,3.6889,0.5683,6.0832,1.2712,6.7047,0.074,7.6338,1.1363,0.0989,2.163,3.1853,6.5158,3.841,2.2585,3.3863,2.9585,2.3459,1.209,1.3765,0.0016,0.0,0.0001,8.6432,1.2467,6.7503,0.4031,6.6749,0.5448,1.3633,1.662,0.2131,0.0,2.5765,9.2374,3.6017,1.4785,8.1483,0.8867,5.1307,4.8355,6.264,1.1101,0.9294,5.5548,3.249,1.5294,1.0257,0.3165,1.7697,3.8891,2.4722,4.3729,3.7279,0.047,3.0715,2.3365,1.2569,2.37,5.7214,3.7921,4.5756,0.3471,2.5761,4.8685,0.0041,3.2349,3.9068,4.6285,0.7703,2.1238,4.573,2.7324,0.2471,4.3758,1.5722,4.8414,2.751,1.2704,0.3252,0.7794,7.9718,6.5961,0.9619,0.7572,5.5441,1.6906,0.6697,5.1173,0.9206,3.1413,8.0326,0.0142,2.6771,0.0078,0.0833,5.9526,4.6118,2.4426,2.8759,1.085,4.7058,0.5669,1.7382,1.197,2.3602,2.3692,2.4082,2.0509,0.6366,1.9976,5.4183,2.5468,1.932,3.0665,4.0753,0.5335,3.8662,5.6296,3.3601,4.1293,4.4152,0.0353,1.6441,6.4901,0.1001,0.3197,1.6201,3.0842,2.6967,0.0863,1.0294,2.533,2.2732,3.5724,0.1658,3.0887,0.0304,0.0343,2.9545,3.6936,2.2737,6.4491,1.2671,4.9537,1.9423,2.982,0.6784,1.1547,1.6911,4.6037,0.0239,2.6919,4.7013,0.0009,5.1119,0.0662,3.9594,0.9491,2.163,3.9907,2.1372,3.7699,1.2411,5.7719,0.0349,0.0003,2.9484,3.3784,0.0128,0.0032,8.0811,3.9435,1.3373,1.8486,2.8965,0.0017,4.464,0.6699,2.1805,0.0633,0.6031,0.1049,7.9444,2.8623,2.7294,0.1234,3.7806,4.2212,2.3174,3.7354,0.8536,1.0836,0.9089,2.5947,0.5791,0.3656,2.5443,6.8587,1.3225,4.7242,0.2233,0.5073,3.1093,1.4125,4.5494,4.2469,5.8315,4.2448,4.7072,2.298,4.7485,5.1428,8.9285,0.1054,0.0062,1.291,0.7677,0.4764,5.6651,5.3695,2.8463,4.1382,1.466,0.4332,3.7753,4.6454,2.3025,3.5711,0.0044,1.1029,2.787,2.0513,1.1472,6.5175,2.9865,3.6416,2.2091,4.5665,0.0125,2.6409,0.762,4.423,0.6665,6.7484,4.6532,2.9245,6.5549,4.5206,4.0047,4.4179,1.0881,1.3454,5.6814,1.408,3.8623,1.3897,0.1106,6.7533,0.0176,1.564,0.7105,1.1327,2.6215,4.1442,5.3082,2.7053,0.3177,4.1434,0.6486,0.4124,1.521,1.1084,2.516,5.605,3.6942,6.2602,0.0411,2.3155,0.7874]}
{"id":848,"ended":true,"length":293,"text":"While in the planning stages, the ride was going to be named Velocetron and themed as The Man of Steel. The ride was announced on January 5, 1996 as Superman : The Ride - A Smallville Adventure. The ride incorporated elements of a Superman movie and an interactive, action packed video game, all while being a complete experience. The first time out, the ride was only open between June 28 and July 1, 1996. It was named Ride of the Century by the Guinness Book of World Records for 1997 and Ride of the Year in 1996 and 1997.\n\nThe ride has received a number and types of upgrades. The 3D system was replaced in early 1999. Following the replacement of the 3D system, the ride was repainted in the new Superman and Smallville themes. The coaster now has two trains and they are not themed in any way; the ride is known as the Superman coaster. The coaster also underwent a refurbishment between October 2009 and August 2010. A further redesign by Arrow Dynamics was in preparation for the Smallville: The Ride, due to begin in 2012.\n\nAfter an eight-year absence, Smallville: The Ride, or simply Smallville, premiered at Six Flags Over Texas in Irving, Texas on May 5, 2014 as a dark ride and will be a permanent part of the park. The entrance to the ride is along the north main plaza, where the Batman: The Ride entrance used to be. The attraction will close after its 2016 season and remain as a permanent structure of the park.","token_len":311,"entropy":[4.097,1.5458,8.649,1.2172,0.6979,1.798,8.8525,2.317,4.4535,0.1783,0.5164,7.4546,8.0795,1.5045,7.8646,5.4405,2.9689,9.0337,3.5963,4.6555,6.4009,3.8822,1.7323,0.7022,2.1342,2.2652,1.4674,6.3624,2.4482,3.6131,3.4315,0.7998,4.5617,3.3583,8.0956,7.7295,1.266,1.8483,5.2127,3.8555,8.4458,1.547,2.6289,0.9402,1.7775,0.7988,8.7714,2.5481,0.6703,3.6013,3.6517,3.0074,1.9505,3.9529,4.9559,5.4387,3.9742,3.2961,3.9839,0.1987,2.3684,3.5302,2.7872,3.1994,3.0228,5.0732,6.0766,0.9245,1.5376,4.2188,4.7165,8.3448,1.2933,1.2603,1.1205,0.7754,5.2828,4.2052,8.4686,5.191,4.0848,0.7879,0.6465,2.0227,0.4796,0.3895,0.4468,3.0936,0.6701,4.7808,6.1964,1.8865,0.0544,2.5455,1.8929,1.5036,5.0264,0.4549,0.0179,0.1207,0.0062,2.8536,9.9101,2.3229,5.1739,0.0877,0.0801,1.2762,2.6985,2.6021,4.4619,2.5817,1.726,1.4205,0.0084,1.652,1.0884,3.4621,4.3614,1.7911,1.4361,9.3469,7.1003,0.0206,5.3946,2.179,1.1762,6.8013,0.8521,4.8007,1.9399,2.8972,3.7175,4.6385,2.4803,2.8589,7.1008,1.1088,4.2997,0.9757,0.347,1.1707,0.0127,0.629,0.5238,0.7401,0.8595,0.9405,6.1351,0.5991,1.7475,2.6747,3.3293,7.6437,3.9875,8.2746,0.0038,4.893,0.5746,1.0415,6.2745,4.6236,1.3063,3.6718,7.1625,2.4433,6.8239,1.2161,4.8666,6.2381,2.6717,1.1238,0.1534,5.3217,1.8783,2.9248,1.27,6.1479,0.6199,1.1347,3.6254,4.7504,0.9148,1.1191,3.5194,2.6823,6.9425,1.1622,6.1285,0.1897,7.0932,3.7672,4.8212,0.0797,3.6108,1.9959,0.5364,4.2453,6.7106,3.4879,6.4537,9.4072,6.4659,1.6992,4.7506,4.892,0.4501,0.6617,10.3042,0.0062,6.5112,1.5624,0.8396,2.7438,4.7499,0.4459,5.5884,1.1813,3.5836,0.2139,0.6249,0.0002,4.9436,4.7632,4.7106,2.0218,0.8148,3.1639,0.4804,6.1934,0.0059,1.0032,0.0361,0.0028,4.8482,5.1242,3.6192,1.783,0.0375,1.2861,7.3874,1.9072,9.3618,0.0328,5.6879,0.4742,1.0703,7.6682,0.1724,0.2158,0.9937,2.3212,3.3786,0.0417,3.0098,4.2604,1.6261,9.0171,3.0831,4.5901,4.3427,1.2045,3.8481,4.701,2.5492,0.0047,0.3227,1.7705,1.6802,1.4037,9.3817,1.0005,0.1842,0.9882,0.999,7.1164,1.0114,3.4768,6.4087,4.8326,1.8136,3.0979,1.4416,8.6136,3.8776,0.9653,2.7657,5.6504,6.8337,0.0209,0.1036,0.6035,1.4541,4.3539,1.9736,5.2488,3.5891,4.4831,5.6552,3.0631,1.8439,3.7906,4.4643,1.0488,1.9481,5.7476,4.4726,0.3999,0.2438,0.5461]}

{"id":2199,"ended":true,"length":287,"text":"Early skyscrapers were mainly made up of small office cubicles, commonly only 12 feet ( 3 @. @ 7 m ) across, which were placed adjacent to one another along long corridors, one at each corner, to maximize the floor area of a given space. The first modern skyscrapers were primarily residential, while a few corporate edifices had office space.\n\nA variety of technologies were developed to allow the small spaces of the office building to be transformed into a spacious interior. First, a system of corridors, often called \"passages\", was built through the building to connect the cubicles. Next, an interior divider wall was constructed, allowing two adjoining cubicles to be viewed through a large plate of glass that separated each space from opposite sides and was supported by pillars. In the early to mid 20th century, the partition walls were covered with translucent glazing, which allowed workers to walk between cubicles without having to pass through a passageway or an interior dividing wall. Cubicles in most modern office buildings use large sliding doors, which allow the occupants to walk comfortably between the office spaces they occupy.\n\nThe building techniques and design of early skyscrapers have evolved gradually and continue to be adapted. At the same time, larger office spaces are often used for both commercial and residential purposes, allowing architects to create taller buildings in which more expensive materials may be used. In addition, the trend toward skyscrapers in smaller cities has encouraged many architects to attempt to create new designs and spaces of this sort.","token_len":311,"entropy":[12.8744,0.7697,0.0001,3.2803,7.9817,3.4399,2.2944,0.0228,4.1688,5.4119,9.4658,0.0392,1.3853,8.7785,6.6502,5.129,2.7321,3.9417,12.0376,13.6515,6.7578,7.9458,6.5628,2.6955,2.5826,4.4964,1.5501,2.9153,1.3074,4.9065,5.2195,0.0809,2.5264,0.0101,5.2251,6.9298,2.6784,2.1678,5.0929,2.7263,2.8116,2.9044,2.1228,2.9989,3.7277,1.4425,6.2394,0.4352,1.8699,3.041,4.4949,2.4828,0.2689,1.9944,4.1703,6.5841,0.7339,1.6254,0.0046,0.7069,6.2913,5.6453,0.9598,4.0688,4.2481,1.407,7.3418,8.1222,0.0295,0.0001,3.2456,3.494,3.1777,1.8284,1.4917,0.1538,3.7365,5.5352,0.0071,6.2186,1.079,2.5606,0.6707,4.2352,2.2091,7.0232,4.1606,2.1382,1.367,2.7151,3.5673,0.1838,0.8304,4.9188,0.4749,2.4418,5.7188,6.4424,1.3538,4.6759,0.7894,2.2756,5.886,0.3845,7.6032,2.409,5.4592,2.2104,2.041,5.0389,3.6897,2.3495,0.666,2.7737,5.17,1.9618,3.2365,1.8207,3.8042,0.8156,4.3486,0.2469,1.7313,4.6016,0.0538,3.4439,4.278,7.8126,0.0047,6.6216,0.6031,1.7575,3.4183,3.8338,5.4243,4.7086,0.7882,0.0353,0.1753,0.548,5.1304,3.3391,1.819,3.9108,7.8253,2.8354,0.9824,3.8049,3.5966,3.7615,4.6278,1.2762,9.4209,2.0229,4.985,3.3487,4.9416,0.3153,5.9544,1.0103,3.4803,1.6404,2.4021,6.2091,0.0321,2.4359,0.0156,0.0545,0.1424,1.7689,8.2635,2.2486,1.0897,4.6822,0.442,6.4726,6.5022,1.4782,1.2819,1.4792,1.7581,4.7653,0.1467,3.9666,3.7679,2.222,0.0361,1.5309,2.2637,0.01,5.5475,0.0806,1.6641,5.2154,0.0403,0.0034,2.9102,4.6188,4.8656,6.5957,0.1775,0.192,9.1319,0.3959,3.2388,5.8074,3.1821,2.3609,0.1419,6.0594,5.094,6.0747,1.2332,1.701,0.8977,2.3123,2.1306,3.2113,0.1502,1.9603,6.9721,1.3685,1.8892,5.0395,3.8367,5.3877,1.0508,0.2484,0.9274,0.0002,1.8743,3.4987,9.1417,2.7578,3.1368,1.592,5.2927,0.9744,0.031,0.0098,3.1254,3.3741,5.9228,4.144,5.0556,0.1169,3.3557,4.1778,4.7151,4.7678,1.0934,1.7324,0.0009,0.0904,6.0981,2.4192,3.4689,1.8239,3.8192,2.3482,1.568,4.7585,2.9519,0.1525,1.1654,0.6106,1.3875,4.528,5.2392,0.2878,1.8951,5.197,1.1206,3.0815,3.6363,3.0426,7.1827,2.7089,4.1823,0.1948,0.6851,0.6854,2.6034,2.0488,0.3515,1.8387,7.6749,1.5917,5.452,0.2195,0.3585,2.9782,4.689,5.4048,1.007,4.6983,3.8095,1.8641,0.0821,6.433,0.7627,2.2277,3.8241,4.072,2.8926,5.2736,3.8279,4.2747,2.5633,0.5609]}

{"id":422,"ended":true,"length":285,"text":"In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition ( mainly Presbyterian ) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, with the aim of establishing a Republican Ireland. The Society of United Irishmen (SOUI) is commonly referred to as the UDR ( a unitary republican paramilitary group formed out of the remnants of the army of the Irish Republic), which had an annual membership of 30,000. The organization was founded on 1 July 1798 by John Mitchel, Hugh Cuffe, William Smith Macdonagh, Joseph Devlin, Henry Joy McCracken, Patrick Pearse and Thomas Francis Meagher, who met in Clontarf on 1 July to plot their rebellion against British rule and the Catholic monarchy of King George III. Despite widespread sympathy for its aims, the uprising failed and its leaders were executed. Following the suppression of the insurrection by British soldiers in Dublin on Easter Monday 1798 and the arrest of its principal leaders, the leadership of the SOUI fled to America and Canada. The surviving leaders were all imprisoned for the next thirty years. The rebels took up arms again on 10 or 11 February 1803, demanding that the Catholic king be replaced with a Protestant monarch, and were defeated without bloodshed.

{"id":3649,"ended":true,"length":276,"text":"Ashdod has seen much of its growth as the result of absorption of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number of young Soviet Jews, who were then transferred to Tel Aviv after a few years. The first modern settlements were established by the end of the 1950s. Several of the older neighborhoods, like Mahane Yehuda, were developed later in the 1970s.\n\nWith the beginning of the Israeli-Jordanian War, Ashdod was encircled from the south. During 1948 Jordanian soldiers and civilians held a number of villages along the waterfront of Ashdod city, including the port city Jaffa. The Arab armies had built up their forces on the coastal plain in preparation for the war. The fighting on the peninsula was characterized by the capture of the peninsula at the hands of the IDF. As the fighting progressed further afield from the port city itself, more land was occupied and many towns were retaken by Israel. Several settlements were built along the coast which would serve as harbours in the future.\n\nThe city was then subjected to repeated attacks from the Palestine Liberation Organisation and other Palestinian factions. In 1967 and 1973 war operations were carried out on Ashdod, as well as Tel Aviv. Ashdod is protected by a naval base which consists of several ports along the coast which are serviced by small landing craft. The city is the location of Israeli Air Force headquarters. Ashdod is home to approximately 190,000 residents.","token_len":313,"entropy":[6.6327,4.7922,4.6831,5.5243,5.1482,1.7598,4.71,4.4676,3.0132,2.4257,5.229,0.0071,11.2399,0.7651,5.6426,1.8975,2.3646,4.7908,6.1398,2.2764,5.9982,2.2114,0.8389,5.0832,1.3229,2.4137,1.204,2.6528,1.4687,3.8035,0.0703,9.0819,0.0457,0.0009,8.5494,2.5089,2.1076,0.5859,0.0173,4.7248,7.9454,1.5564,1.9273,2.1725,1.5323,3.4366,5.2351,0.2245,6.9635,0.0181,4.6203,3.0728,3.5428,0.3491,1.1061,2.3398,2.9762,6.9129,3.0465,0.9076,2.5093,2.4727,1.6095,5.0689,0.0023,0.108,3.0286,0.0031,0.8661,6.9021,1.9486,1.0785,5.4698,7.5414,2.452,2.4975,6.7919,5.7438,8.1001,0.1875,0.5469,1.076,1.6395,4.8963,5.7929,2.1122,0.1868,3.1633,0.0013,0.8242,1.5155,0.0023,5.3785,1.0516,5.4823,0.0071,0.1687,3.9937,1.1928,7.5216,0.1206,3.3803,1.2592,0.8409,0.0072,0.0006,2.3586,8.8514,0.0452,0.0098,4.7538,0.6484,1.6776,2.8603,4.0501,5.5096,8.8863,3.1835,3.5852,2.1847,6.1187,2.3914,3.2647,0.0024,2.8675,3.2394,0.2662,8.8145,1.9762,1.6263,0.009,0.0008,6.2837,1.5248,2.5803,1.7677,6.9749,2.0581,7.7127,0.8194,0.1791,0.6152,1.7615,4.7903,3.8962,3.2286,5.5843,1.8843,2.057,1.5708,2.6489,0.5369,4.0982,2.0593,3.4152,4.8603,0.0629,0.9127,3.1555,0.4216,1.8341,4.4696,4.6092,0.4926,5.1675,1.5273,6.6928,0.0664,2.5419,4.7021,0.2061,2.2303,6.2741,6.0373,1.1374,3.8223,0.0007,0.7333,5.0127,1.1707,4.259,1.2934,2.505,2.2919,5.5162,7.0781,8.2859,5.0807,1.2633,2.6818,0.8109,7.3952,0.1893,4.7758,4.3424,0.2624,4.8999,2.0208,4.0499,3.4333,1.1317,5.9487,0.0153,1.8531,3.0841,0.4033,5.6581,3.4393,0.5718,2.3105,1.6794,0.167,1.7202,5.0059,4.2324,4.3128,0.1645,6.1452,0.1651,5.1329,0.4858,3.4417,1.1299,0.7853,0.0002,1.7358,4.5812,1.6491,3.8603,5.4231,0.0076,4.859,1.6111,1.7272,0.8722,8.1243,0.0389,1.7007,1.8614,2.5909,2.9202,2.2411,0.6653,2.2065,1.9656,4.4949,3.4446,7.1378,7.9306,1.8178,2.0719,0.0151,1.8185,1.8979,0.0072,0.0005,1.8615,4.0284,0.5019,0.0265,6.278,0.024,0.9394,3.6891,0.0072,0.0007,3.7756,8.4338,0.3963,1.8675,4.1088,2.0312,2.9215,5.3499,0.1634,3.5816,5.0894,3.8976,0.1939,1.4271,3.6009,1.3061,7.5917,0.0023,0.0523,5.471,7.4454,1.0658,0.5859,1.4624,3.4615,1.3675,3.94,4.7476,0.1895,4.2867,4.4379,0.11,4.2916,1.2451,3.1096,0.0068,0.0012,1.0602,2.8682,0.0069,4.3643,7.1055,0.5053,0.0055,2.0792,0.9434]}

On 22 September, British troops were heading to Palestine from Jordan on the British-built Trans-Jordan Highway, a major strategic link between the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula. However, they were stopped by Turkish-backed tribesmen from entering their former land. On 23 September, the British cavalry of the Palestine Mounted Division managed to penetrate the Turkish defences and captured the town from the rear.\n\nThis would make the Turks the target of a British military offensive and Haifa was once again opened as a military gateway to Palestine. On 22 May 1920, the Arab Revolt was declared with the support of the Palestinian masses and it was a call to arms. With the backing of the Arab Revolt, Haifa was captured by British forces on 3 May with minimal Turkish military resistance. However, in spite of Haifa's strategic importance, the British decided not to occupy the city in order to avoid a serious confrontation with the pro-Ottoman Arab tribes who controlled the area.\n\nMeanwhile, in Palestine, the Palestine Committee was established and it declared the establishment of separate Arab states in the wake of the Arab Revolt.\n\nOn 15 July 1921, the Palestine Committee issued the Declaration of Independence which recognized as the national aspirations of all the non-Jewish ethnic groups in Palestine. The Declaration of Independence set out to establish an independent state as the first step towards the creation of a Jewish federation.","token_len":313,"entropy":[9.5368,4.1152,5.5516,3.9359,1.4424,11.0552,0.1898,0.0057,1.8687,4.8677,4.2833,2.7448,8.097,8.9937,0.3704,4.5517,0.4217,3.5603,1.9337,4.9979,6.1238,0.8436,7.4084,3.9128,10.4809,0.0571,3.516,0.7725,3.1207,0.4752,4.7437,4.5262,2.1548,1.9485,4.0415,2.2635,2.616,7.9789,1.1495,5.6511,3.7185,4.141,4.1818,1.9202,5.1898,2.1014,3.2227,6.2175,1.0348,0.9372,3.3247,1.7374,3.5145,3.8712,4.293,5.1499,1.029,0.7841,4.4378,0.0134,0.0318,1.2673,4.4562,0.5544,0.2006,4.8848,0.0493,3.3571,0.7635,3.3282,0.6189,2.4516,4.2479,0.7203,6.3153,1.1553,3.5861,6.4839,2.547,8.55,4.078,1.1874,3.3964,2.4365,0.0838,0.2883,1.6502,1.7917,5.723,4.4011,0.5041,7.2634,8.1375,0.074,2.8724,6.3828,0.0327,4.997,0.9681,1.6926,3.4945,1.2158,3.9706,0.9982,3.24,4.7781,0.8416,9.8189,1.1644,1.6793,0.0094,4.6532,5.3041,4.4059,1.6165,5.3125,1.6271,6.8465,0.2812,1.9884,3.3568,4.3482,1.342,3.6143,10.1688,0.0003,3.0544,5.1175,0.365,7.3625,2.773,0.5356,4.1684,5.6144,0.9025,2.5552,0.351,3.1617,4.2154,3.2969,3.9222,0.2768,1.2275,6.1988,6.0829,0.1645,3.7102,2.1356,4.363,0.743,3.9067,0.0087,0.7886,4.5995,5.8094,1.8208,4.0132,0.9688,3.5622,8.042,0.7529,0.9123,2.8047,4.4628,0.819,4.4456,0.0124,0.5784,1.9325,3.7673,0.0009,0.8486,2.3285,0.0005,0.7101,5.4294,0.9421,2.1898,0.8219,1.2886,3.7725,1.7012,5.8987,7.9311,8.6702,5.1804,3.3435,0.2955,4.3761,0.0353,3.1079,4.4576,0.0017,5.2966,0.001,0.6665,5.1026,0.7479,0.9583,0.9152,1.1234,5.2017,2.5412,0.0014,4.739,0.9346,1.524,2.8397,2.4385,0.0257,3.4424,1.9511,5.6754,2.6449,0.6188,0.3852,7.7188,0.0466,4.872,0.0407,2.8972,4.1866,3.3401,3.8542,0.8471,2.35,0.2955,1.0595,0.0001,5.884,0.1658,2.0988,3.0328,0.3173,0.8823,6.1305,5.1975,2.7374,1.9491,2.101,3.0224,5.9563,1.996,1.3774,0.0405,8.4176,3.5084,3.5847,1.8346,1.7084,5.744,0.0009,0.2039,1.6116,1.1159,0.0014,0.3633,3.1712,0.0001,3.6522,3.8029,2.4086,2.1995,0.1992,0.8498,2.2898,1.4646,3.5472,1.9913,2.108,0.205,1.1984,2.7912,4.941,6.0434,1.7013,4.8254,5.3833,0.1586,2.2355,1.5172,6.8615,0.0298,2.6331,6.4361,1.0607,1.0703,0.2351,0.6518,1.3419,2.0636,1.497,0.1206,5.1637,0.8281,3.246,1.8769,2.3021,0.5528,1.739,4.8401,1.924,4.0817,0.9268,0.6022,1.4792,2.4533,0.0334,0.5138,1.4462,8.0511,1.4027]}

You can call it, `the Brady Bunch', or you can call it `The Flintstones'. That is the question of whether you are a fan of the early `70s prime time family sitcom or the later `60s animated comedy about a family that looks like the former and sounds more like the latter. If your favorite cartoon character is the one who has the thick, square glasses and an equally thick, square voice, then perhaps the answer to that question is quite simple. And for those who do choose that answer, perhaps you choose both.\n\nIn the end, who really cares? I would bet that we will all have a long and happy life if we take life for what it is, don't take it too seriously, and treat each other with respect.

The first two tell about the founder of the Jain tradition, Vidy\u0101p\u0101da ( V\u0101sudeva ). The last one describes the first council ( samiti ) of scholars, Vidy\u0101p\u0101da\u2019s contemporary scholars. While the stories are different in themselves, the two are interwoven very closely into one another, suggesting that the tradition of Vidy\u0101p\u0101da was inherited and preserved as a historical tradition through the generations. One text describes Vidy\u0101p\u0101da as \u2018teacher of sages who teach to all those who have knowledge of the one self - \u015ar\u012b V\u0101sudeva\u2019 while the parallel narrative asserts that he was also a teacher of \u015ar\u012b V\u0101sudeva and in addition, taught to those who were ignorant of the one self. The following narratives give an insight into the teaching of the early Jain tradition, its founder and his associates.\n\nThis work is in the public domain in the United States of America, and possibly other nations.

Biographer, John Barnes, writes that after this abandonment, all Duarte left to the family was a single gold ring on his finger. The family struggled through the next few years.\n\nEven the birth of his eldest son, Juan Francisco, did not make Juan Duarte financially secure. He only managed to send him four times to boarding school.\n\nBy the time the family finally moved to Mexico City, the economic climate worsened. Juan was forced to rent rooms. He finally resorted to earning money through a variety and scale of illegal trades.\n\nDuarte's only son Juan Francisco also got into the business. One day, Juan Francisco tried to poison his father. When Juan Duarte discovered the act, he beat him. Juan Francisco died from the beating.\n\nAfter this incident Juan turned to crime. He was forced to flee Mexico City, but his efforts to do so were unsuccessful.\n\nJuan Francisco was not the only child that was affected by Juan's crime. Juan Duarte's second son, Juan Juan also tried to kill his father. However, Juan Duarte caught him first. Then Juan Duarte became his stepfather.

It features 55 compositions by Masafumi Takada and 6 by Jun Fukuda across two discs. Takada put a different spin on the original game's tracks by adding his own electronic compositions into the tracks, sometimes including a remix by himself, while Fukuda wrote mostly straight-ahead techno tracks, with a few exceptions. \"A New Tomorrow (Un-New World)\" was the opening theme for Killer7's PlayStation 2 remake; the original soundtrack featured elements of rock, electro, and funk.\n\nThe soundtrack has received a positive and negative reception from critics, with one saying \"Takada's work offers only a slightly improved set of remixes of the songs that have become synonymous with the game. However, the soundtrack is very strong in comparison to the actual game; it has become a fan favourite among fans of the game, but a disappointment to those hoping that Takada would produce an entirely new soundtrack for the game.\" and another saying \"Despite the fact both Masafumi Takada and Jun Fukuda have composed music for the Killer7 soundtrack, the two are very different stylistically, so there's only so much you can do to improve upon the originals.

{"id":4201,"ended":false,"length":257,"text":"Martinsburg, West Virginia, businessman C. Leslie Golliday filed the initial application for the station with the FCC on September 1, 1954. In the application, Golliday estimated construction costs at $750,000 and estimated coverage at 50 miles. The station was assigned the call sign WVBR on October 3, 1954 and began regular operations on September 25, 1955. As the owner of WMBR, Golliday did not hold any official duties at the station; instead, he leased the studio to Jack O'Brien, who owned WNRJ, and allowed O'Brien to hold the license for the station.\n\nWVBR operated for four years as a daytime-only station. When the Federal Communications Commission allowed WNRJ to upgrade to daytime operation on November 10, 1957, Golliday petitioned to move his own station to the frequency on which WNRJ was licensed. The FCC approved a request from Golliday to move WVBR to channel 13 on March 2, 1959. Operations of WVBR were ended on March 3, 1959, and the station was sold to Walter L. \"Skip\" Thomas, who operated the station as a daytime-only station for six years and then sold the station to WLKG (AM). WLKG broadcast a talk station format on WVBR from 1959 until 1963, when the station was deleted from the dial as a result of a power limit increase at WLKG.\n\nSee also\n Radio broadcasting in West Virginia\n\nReferences","token_len":315,"entropy":[8.2317,4.4211,0.9029,5.3061,0.0593,1.9513,10.8824,6.2959,0.6413,9.1204,4.7315,5.7718,7.6596,5.6865,3.0794,6.0799,3.6058,0.8355,1.7641,9.6993,5.0242,0.3934,3.4588,1.4396,3.4118,3.1367,0.5088,7.5764,0.5046,2.8046,2.2,1.8202,0.4345,0.6592,0.0038,0.0027,7.7983,8.34,1.8047,2.0124,0.3179,5.5042,0.2445,0.0271,1.882,1.9226,8.2207,2.2772,3.5309,1.1711,2.376,1.7133,2.3875,1.182,5.9389,2.3139,7.6512,2.0523,4.0061,4.0901,7.3344,4.992,1.8723,3.0673,0.113,0.5149,2.4236,4.3168,7.1558,2.8403,0.8894,3.3168,3.4808,0.2903,1.0404,0.1784,4.8018,1.7816,7.6687,0.2653,2.5897,10.6696,2.2377,0.8465,0.5429,0.0033,0.0046,4.6647,0.2002,4.3305,0.804,3.8726,3.3266,3.3772,0.5297,0.3162,4.3867,2.097,0.2178,0.3802,4.1229,0.8142,7.9779,1.0566,8.3312,4.6013,0.3605,1.7297,1.0388,1.4113,2.9211,3.6883,8.7627,5.3914,2.1112,2.3466,6.5119,2.127,0.0018,0.002,0.1717,4.8735,1.0237,5.1405,1.7764,0.9589,0.7113,1.0827,2.1849,0.0008,4.8731,3.1897,0.0966,3.0426,1.8429,3.7896,0.403,3.4436,0.7167,5.7354,4.9078,1.2634,1.2185,1.8069,4.5076,1.2569,7.9471,0.6644,0.0061,5.6455,0.9824,7.8659,0.0066,0.2048,7.8164,1.0893,2.6764,2.8762,1.7392,2.5508,3.5094,0.0086,2.6547,0.0411,2.1764,0.0076,0.0144,7.0568,0.0005,3.1903,4.6,4.1694,5.1445,1.7146,0.9017,1.7391,8.566,4.821,1.7871,1.9315,4.2634,0.0067,1.3404,5.63,0.6298,1.5742,0.6669,3.0056,3.7186,4.7658,1.8985,1.847,0.0119,0.0195,1.1285,1.9146,1.646,0.7148,0.0174,0.7775,7.2217,4.9323,1.8359,3.5715,3.1398,0.0125,2.1784,0.887,10.4307,2.9171,0.5089,0.0696,0.0112,1.8734,6.5461,0.3666,1.5537,2.9866,0.1611,0.9103,0.8825,1.1204,1.3489,0.5347,0.7556,4.0884,0.7979,6.7683,3.5194,0.4009,6.2508,4.7382,0.0463,5.7876,1.0665,1.2052,3.0808,1.0663,0.7086,2.4883,0.6573,2.2675,1.3002,0.0115,0.7306,1.4958,3.4469,0.3397,3.2146,3.5026,2.7861,1.1172,0.4435,0.2559,4.7456,4.3574,3.3648,3.8423,4.1791,9.9599,5.8471,3.1774,0.4956,0.0021,0.0008,6.1357,3.2463,6.3468,4.2541,8.0047,1.4289,1.5022,0.2656,0.0218,2.7217,3.1583,1.5656,3.2273,1.0362,2.2572,1.8531,0.3243,0.7425,8.8648,0.7106,0.8161,6.4682,7.0713,1.2796,1.8992,0.0593,2.2093,4.3547,8.5242,2.8808,4.1674,1.5597,1.3342,0.0193,0.0038,0.7196,1.1115,0.0001,6.9655,0.7469,2.2283,24.2754,6.953,2.2675,3.7246,0.0197,1.4049,0.0003,3.918]}

I have never seen a free copy of the Daily Mail, but have managed to secure myself two free copies of the DVD (so far, so good).\n\nIn the opening moments of the TV film, we see the opening titles for Sense and Sensibility. I suspect that they were put in for copyright reasons, otherwise this is a very strange thing to do, if nothing else.\n\nIt makes you wonder why they were not used as the opening sequence for the BBC miniseries. The use of the music was probably also for copyright.\n\nThe only way to really enjoy this BBC TV film is to watch it on a nice widescreen TV screen with really good speakers. Watching it on a DVD on a PC monitors is not really an option.\n\nIf you can do that, then I think there may be a good chance of finding some enjoyment out of Sense and Sensibility.

{"id":114,"ended":false,"length":261,"text":"Markgraf was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the Battle of Jutland which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate the British fleet, which had successfully fought off an attack by a much stronger German fleet on the 29th of the month, while avoiding a complete breakdown of their main battle line, the largest in naval history. However, the Germans were unable to draw forth enough forces to engage the British fleet, and the loss of their submarines and minesweepers enabled the British to make significant gains. The loss of the dreadnoughts HMS Dreadnought and HMS Dreadnought contributed to Germany's retreat after the battle.\n\nIn recognition of his service during Jutland, Markgraf was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 24 January 1917.\n\nMarkgraf received the Pour le M\u00e9rite on 2 October 1918.\n\nOn 1 October 1918 Markgraf was posted to the German High Seas Fleet in Kiel as Kapit\u00e4n zur See (KZS), Vice Admiral of the Vice-Admiralty in command of the II Battle Squadron. He was relieved of this command and arrested by the Allies in January 1919. His fate was sealed on 1 February 1920; his request to be repatriated to Germany was rejected and as a result he died of dysentery in Tach\u00e9 Prison near Tours.\n\nReferences\n Jutland - The sinking of the German warships SMS Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen Markgraf","token_len":318,"entropy":[7.4984,3.2549,4.166,6.5181,2.6428,0.4465,11.5842,5.8924,4.2397,3.4119,0.0376,0.5876,5.6671,0.0396,5.2022,0.8887,0.0029,4.9864,2.9968,0.0973,1.0379,4.4215,2.4182,5.4086,6.1344,0.6076,3.3857,0.3904,2.1437,4.0659,3.2369,8.7963,7.6984,0.7438,5.7172,4.2687,3.7092,6.6983,0.9369,3.1918,2.3868,2.2805,2.7345,1.4521,6.0168,4.2986,3.1683,3.5126,1.4697,0.8088,4.0248,7.5736,2.4455,2.0428,2.0748,2.9086,1.5331,7.4091,0.8973,1.3715,3.9946,1.3128,2.3421,3.9708,6.521,1.7479,4.9212,5.0468,0.852,3.2296,3.9087,3.3094,1.8644,3.2119,2.472,7.2366,3.0169,4.6814,0.0454,0.2016,3.9194,0.1031,1.3536,2.6489,1.7575,1.9099,0.0238,4.5149,6.8772,2.9337,3.1176,0.3819,5.6935,0.5307,0.6571,0.8852,1.6677,1.1514,1.575,5.1206,0.0532,2.9331,8.2287,1.9153,5.8302,3.5091,0.0968,0.0019,5.7567,0.7599,1.4718,0.7574,4.1102,3.5974,1.1351,1.6043,1.8922,3.1933,0.0609,1.4441,7.9601,0.0177,0.5672,0.0,11.2083,6.4319,0.0383,0.5709,0.7359,0.6231,5.174,0.1371,0.0194,13.3131,0.6139,5.3153,0.1735,4.633,5.7123,0.5326,1.7191,1.7882,1.1361,0.0205,2.8062,7.6515,0.02,5.2893,3.4878,3.0183,7.1643,0.003,0.0003,0.3535,6.1657,0.0351,0.0002,1.4248,0.9188,0.4875,4.9739,2.128,0.6204,2.7349,2.0131,6.231,0.7823,2.3721,4.1711,3.1509,1.8644,0.764,1.541,0.0002,3.7711,0.0538,0.0004,3.7076,0.9824,13.0651,4.4809,6.9453,2.7547,4.0434,3.4159,3.6692,1.5359,1.2295,0.8031,0.0002,4.2353,2.7553,2.1681,0.8971,3.3489,0.0088,0.0003,1.325,6.7708,0.9417,1.3352,4.3848,4.9767,3.3213,0.9476,1.8775,5.1066,1.5243,3.7461,13.378,3.4348,2.9027,3.7923,8.1971,1.1055,8.0604,4.8879,0.9397,7.3657,3.6408,1.8272,9.5272,0.3118,0.9726,0.2921,8.3683,0.9019,0.2715,0.005,2.2582,4.3395,6.5675,0.1028,0.2677,8.2704,8.3412,5.1264,1.2342,1.6547,0.8887,4.8763,1.4547,2.2828,2.6947,2.6779,9.9548,2.1993,0.5172,4.6279,1.8612,4.1391,0.2508,0.4327,3.7796,4.8869,0.563,1.0249,1.1209,2.369,2.148,2.1084,6.2506,2.1899,8.019,1.3867,1.4681,4.3013,0.0021,1.1143,1.5841,0.5017,1.907,2.6542,6.4951,0.8122,0.1491,1.4149,3.7713,3.435,5.5318,0.0013,0.0006,2.1291,6.3688,7.6414,5.501,7.3332,5.3005,7.0891,2.3698,0.5867,0.0002,4.7907,1.1318,17.459,1.7084,0.0068,3.7874,2.5248,9.4407,0.1015,1.048,2.2248,5.4845,12.8525,8.6284,5.9733,0.1895,0.0082,1.0847,8.7234,0.239,1.9713,0.1088,8.7849,0.6003,0.0005]}

His convoy, consisting of Sudirman, a small group of soldiers, and a doctor, then headed south to Semarang, a trading post on the island of Java, on the opposite end of the archipelago. It was there, near the end of March, that the Dutch sent their first warning.\n\nBy the time the Dutch finally forced the Batavians to surrender, it was late April, and the Dutch were preparing for a major assault to take Semarang.\n\nIt was on one of those early morning scouting missions that Joko Widodo had set out from Jakarta, with the support of about two dozen loyal and well armed army officers who joined his crew to assist him in making the escape.\n\nThe navy's submarine was spotted just as it crossed a narrow strait which separates Java from Sumatra, and it was hit with a single torpedo that disabled it. At this point, the crew would have been forced to abandon ship.\n\nDetermined to save his forces, Sudirman had made a last ditch attempt to take the vessel back and to take cover in his official home. His small force attempted to take off, but one of their landing ships was attacked by Dutch ships and quickly sunk. Sudirman had been wounded in the leg in the previous skirmish, although this appears to have been nothing more serious than a scratch.

James Montgomery from MTV described it as a love @ - @ letter to the band's fans and a document of the final years of the band itself. Although critics praised the work's audio and visual qualities, they were notably divided over its meaning. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said that the video was \"more an act of mourning than creative expression \" and called the performance \"a series of awkward, out-of-sorts, out-of-place moments [.\n\nThe video has received millions of views on YouTube and was later used as inspiration for a re-recording of the song's instrumental track by the band The Decemberists. The song has also won and was nominated for numerous awards. The song was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest-charting rock song of 1999 by a British band.\n\nOn May 25, 2001, The Beatles were the first bands and performers to perform in North Korea. In 2003, The Beatles performed \"Eleanor Rigby\" for the Queen during her birthday celebration at Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland.

{"id":329,"ended":true,"length":288,"text":"The current Romanian Land Forces were formed in 1859, immediately after the unification of Wallachia with Moldavia, and were commanded by Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Domnitor of Romania until his abdication in 1866. The main function of the land force was to protect the southern border against the Ottoman Empire, and to safeguard the independence, against the Russian Empire. This function kept the land force engaged in numerous conflicts through the years (including the 1848 revolution, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878). During these conflicts the Romanian land force lost some territories, but also earned a significant amount of military expertise and experience. This historical experience allowed the modernization of the land force, but the modernization was often slow and very expensive. In the late 19th century, to improve the efficiency of the land forces, there was a need to find an alternative to their traditional military formation. Therefore the \"Land Forces of the Romanian Army \" were founded in 1909 by merging several brigades in the field. In 1922 there were only 25 infantry battalions. The following years there was a great expansion of the land forces. Between 1922 and 1930 there were increased the battalions to 80, but also the number of artillery batteries, howitzers and ammunition increased.\n\nDuring World War II the land force was deployed in many battles, including the Eastern Front, Sinai Campaign and the Balkans Campaign. The Romanian land forces were disbanded in 1946. Since that time the land force has been mostly used against rebellious subjects.","token_len":320,"entropy":[6.5575,11.4435,10.7313,6.4681,3.8586,3.4082,1.0884,3.4557,4.2002,1.7535,7.5082,0.6353,0.4376,5.6343,0.0833,10.4204,1.1822,0.0407,2.7375,4.4664,1.9516,1.8404,1.2646,2.0626,3.907,0.0976,7.3966,2.3905,5.5033,8.7408,9.3687,6.5755,1.2272,8.7871,5.8597,8.0648,3.9313,3.383,4.4528,2.4384,8.243,0.0117,0.0067,0.3425,0.9335,3.3991,0.2431,1.7922,5.6104,6.2859,0.1004,0.3656,5.213,1.6192,0.5919,0.3363,2.1934,0.8548,6.3588,1.6483,4.1816,1.7387,4.8576,2.6662,1.3472,1.37,1.1525,4.5621,0.6535,5.6753,5.6659,6.7871,1.4426,4.7976,3.2937,2.1668,4.1675,4.0087,7.6072,0.8256,2.0968,0.573,5.684,0.4501,6.2761,4.0833,5.6136,0.9316,2.3778,4.97,3.1951,0.7966,5.2954,2.6412,5.0996,2.0449,1.7276,3.8791,0.0118,0.3935,0.6096,2.0567,0.393,4.6637,1.7462,2.2805,2.0413,0.283,0.7934,0.2033,1.9212,0.0056,0.2148,0.166,0.1472,0.4103,2.6947,0.0954,0.2594,0.4056,0.8078,3.692,2.6403,0.7785,1.7938,2.8808,1.6713,0.3138,5.3515,3.1241,6.7254,0.9951,1.4969,3.2596,7.3348,2.2348,3.3044,1.2563,0.023,3.2715,5.9633,1.4698,2.064,0.5177,3.5002,6.3881,3.8939,3.7896,0.9606,9.5097,0.0979,0.4809,1.3024,0.2523,1.3041,4.0997,3.1386,4.109,2.0112,4.7735,3.4174,1.0578,5.2153,3.0276,0.3737,2.4783,1.6408,2.6246,1.4335,0.0057,0.1434,0.7265,6.9539,3.4897,0.5477,3.0391,0.2681,0.1751,0.2753,2.6169,0.2821,5.4667,0.5977,0.6891,3.474,0.7048,5.1346,3.6501,1.7773,1.1373,6.9083,2.0223,3.714,5.9806,0.6884,5.168,2.2888,6.1944,2.7226,1.2242,1.0667,1.3496,2.416,2.7621,6.0785,1.8674,4.2116,1.0412,5.3269,2.9337,10.2928,3.2259,7.4794,0.0494,3.366,1.279,4.2327,1.2353,2.8337,4.6779,4.8296,0.3755,4.3197,4.9718,5.3979,2.7377,0.0001,2.0461,1.465,5.9793,2.8071,2.811,3.0606,0.8194,4.1357,3.4604,0.3496,0.2454,1.2351,1.0747,1.5924,3.8655,2.2354,0.1482,3.4675,1.2965,0.1488,6.4015,5.1,9.8925,0.0095,3.3568,4.9237,0.8933,3.5994,3.7942,1.7245,0.8981,0.0529,4.0249,4.2178,2.0624,7.4065,1.0367,0.001,2.0242,5.8424,6.6902,0.877,3.4321,0.0086,3.4457,2.515,0.0043,0.4643,1.572,1.5396,0.8551,0.9194,4.4498,1.2811,3.5813,3.9918,1.1594,1.8071,0.7169,4.4234,0.2377,0.9885,10.0707,4.3906,1.6378,0.6358,4.1784,1.0069,0.3272,1.6374,2.4784,1.2597,1.2811,1.1252,6.1444,0.5599,3.5833,1.1364,4.3574,3.6804,0.0302,1.1832,1.2689,0.3756,0.255,1.0664,5.4525,1.9587,4.0348,7.9256,6.7232,1.5391]}

{"id":1105,"ended":true,"length":304,"text":"Plunketts Creek can vary greatly in depth, depending on the season and recent precipitation. Its water level is typically highest ( perhaps 3 feet ( 1 m ) deep ) in spring or early summer, and tapers off to a shallow ( 1 to 2 foot ( 0.3 to 0.6 m ) depth ) by winter. This section of stream is one of the easiest ones through the gorge ( there are several others more difficult ). We had no trouble with it today, but I suspect that will change if we return next summer ( especially this spring when our trip will be coming up ). The trailhead isn't easy to find - try searching for Plunketts Creek from Lake Oswego if you get lost.\n\nThe trail is easy enough for moderately fit hikers but will be much harder if your legs are really tired or you're carrying backpacks with lots of gear. It's really narrow a few times, so you have to squeeze past each other at times ( the water is deep enough to make this difficult ). It's also right next to steep cliffs, so be extra careful there ( we've seen hikers with poles walk right off the edge or get pinned up against the rocks ). We had to stop to let several people past us today.\n\nIt's a nice little hike that is only a couple miles total but will take about 2 hours to get back to Lake Oswego. If it's too humid out today, another fun hike is the Oswego River Trail right across the street ( it's a little longer, but also only around 2 miles round-trip).","token_len":322,"entropy":[7.4805,9.6525,7.0952,7.0548,7.8116,2.1404,1.1525,4.8643,1.4834,4.2753,0.1204,0.6818,4.0071,1.1013,9.2065,3.426,0.5365,6.7977,3.9263,1.9897,1.1574,3.1817,6.2893,6.2489,13.7555,4.023,1.9474,5.451,3.6557,1.4483,0.9478,4.4188,1.4383,1.3954,2.5839,3.6708,1.6002,0.114,1.0024,1.1158,8.1934,3.2619,0.5922,2.4663,1.4749,3.7911,3.6689,3.4131,2.1422,0.6184,4.8121,0.3908,2.0489,0.5765,2.407,2.1577,1.555,0.0276,1.9716,0.0302,0.075,1.0253,5.2875,2.9726,3.728,0.4029,3.6735,6.4547,0.8397,6.1016,1.1597,4.5235,0.0369,0.3659,4.2922,5.983,8.7642,0.8757,6.9807,4.1108,6.4397,0.5615,2.9217,4.7328,5.8843,2.1646,5.0781,5.95,4.5924,3.6917,1.6711,2.5921,3.3333,6.2496,0.9736,0.9946,3.0253,3.7174,1.4823,4.8711,0.3694,3.5984,1.8185,4.9279,3.8861,2.5272,3.8134,5.5645,5.2271,3.0708,3.2489,4.116,6.3805,2.3544,0.9088,5.7626,1.4381,4.9628,2.4936,4.6807,2.2441,6.2871,0.0021,4.8357,0.4596,1.9039,4.8083,6.8014,3.8663,1.4657,10.7591,0.0167,0.3987,0.2278,3.8259,6.4395,5.118,0.3611,0.001,4.4674,0.1613,5.4383,1.6456,0.8439,1.774,0.6021,2.4132,2.587,2.1175,4.213,3.9702,3.0987,7.4247,7.3711,0.5295,3.7422,4.8242,1.8452,3.7993,1.3611,2.5981,3.7709,4.0409,0.5029,5.6435,2.8996,2.4898,1.6605,1.8411,4.551,7.5986,0.3328,2.9781,4.88,0.0126,3.9269,0.5251,2.8631,0.7529,4.5805,5.5337,7.2961,1.9642,4.8652,1.9389,1.3968,1.8587,3.057,0.1246,6.3864,5.3371,5.981,2.2477,3.4505,3.242,3.5088,4.214,5.0167,1.7247,6.0958,1.504,0.9903,3.149,3.9455,2.0008,1.8739,2.7713,0.5534,1.6897,7.5663,1.9974,0.0201,7.5142,2.8914,1.7015,0.6607,2.8299,5.399,0.3116,3.4083,3.2216,4.2515,3.5426,1.8444,2.3332,4.3874,7.8924,7.0927,4.3424,4.1414,1.5509,3.1188,5.0803,3.5594,5.6371,3.1288,3.58,1.8174,1.7439,3.2888,3.3278,2.6281,1.9132,3.0425,3.2018,5.1618,7.8511,1.7679,7.1916,0.9701,8.5632,2.048,0.8287,0.0003,3.8296,0.4195,1.81,3.2484,2.322,3.1543,2.6986,2.7561,4.1387,1.9258,2.0941,2.294,8.246,4.1267,3.7755,1.4675,2.3323,3.0296,0.7571,0.9221,1.1731,2.9017,0.5816,3.2134,0.1378,0.0007,0.0006,0.4827,3.1241,3.6106,0.7447,2.6684,9.4134,5.4405,5.0471,0.522,7.61,6.9228,1.5711,2.3537,2.3726,7.3529,0.0125,0.0061,3.19,0.7556,8.0846,3.2144,0.7589,4.4304,3.2364,2.8144,0.4802,1.8493,2.4237,3.0466,2.7708,0.3836,5.1784,5.8294,4.9256,2.257,0.8905,6.5805,4.5495,0.0082,0.8974]}
{"id":3194,"ended":true,"length":291,"text":"Christian metal has its origins in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the Jesus movement, a hippie movement with Christian ideology consisting of hippies that converted to Christianity. The Christian hippies within the movement began forming Christian rock bands, such as Stryper and Mercyme. The bands would later split up, causing the Christion underground music scene to flourish in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1984, New Jersey-based Christian metal bands Def Leppard and White Lion merged with a New York-based punk rock band Stray, bringing together two very different styles of music. The band's name was derived by combining the first letters of Def Leppard and Stray's names. Their debut album had an overall rock sound, but songs that had more progressive and aggressive lyrics. In 1994, the band released their self-title debut album, which was well received and commercially successful. Their second album, 1999's The Poison Album, incorporated elements of alternative metal, hip hop and punk rock.\n\nIt had a number of singles, both religious and secular, and spawned several minor hit songs, such as \"I Will Buy You a New Life\", \"In the End or Love\" and \"The Cross Is My Sled\". The album was certified platinum, and spawned a popular cover version of the Guns N' Roses song, \"Paradise City\". However, the band had an unstable line-up. New vocalist Mike Mushok replaced original vocalist Doug Aldrich. To this date, Def Leppard continues to tour and release albums, including 2008's Live...The Hits.","token_len":322,"entropy":[9.9635,5.739,4.0648,3.3348,0.1489,1.1829,3.7917,4.9514,0.1008,1.2256,0.5158,0.1509,0.0001,2.636,1.5327,11.5767,2.0379,1.6744,2.1686,8.2195,0.0866,1.6903,3.9085,6.4826,6.9963,8.3522,0.3789,4.1436,0.5545,4.8603,6.6754,0.5945,1.1281,1.4448,1.7118,4.0089,6.0959,0.8945,8.1525,0.6909,0.4351,3.5226,5.3401,4.2768,4.7744,0.397,1.7817,2.5994,0.0019,5.562,4.7175,3.6286,1.4206,8.0357,12.3132,1.9411,1.8133,4.3085,4.142,3.6249,4.012,1.1249,1.6659,6.4154,1.3919,5.2664,9.2542,6.5906,5.3106,0.3986,0.1686,4.8952,2.1103,0.8074,1.926,0.0137,0.6128,1.0713,0.0025,2.3885,4.6684,0.3309,5.8098,2.5399,2.6487,0.1021,2.8325,0.6884,3.5475,8.2705,2.2795,0.0189,0.5579,6.5702,6.3505,4.9826,1.2639,3.4949,4.0583,1.216,0.6443,0.0208,3.2663,2.0849,0.6444,6.1283,3.9707,3.4561,5.78,2.2458,4.0233,4.3253,0.7134,0.9381,0.2688,1.1893,0.7115,1.3559,2.5755,2.1347,2.4438,0.7385,3.1027,6.0689,3.5777,0.8563,5.035,5.939,0.153,7.2516,0.0068,0.002,2.3431,1.8786,0.167,2.3344,3.127,1.2925,5.1352,3.7757,0.3109,6.4433,2.755,4.5031,5.3805,2.1047,1.2013,1.2654,7.889,3.3366,3.2196,3.9039,5.0737,2.9049,5.1543,2.4229,3.5873,2.7122,4.451,0.1922,1.5706,0.7802,1.5299,1.1408,5.0431,0.009,9.8605,3.9552,1.0091,0.7529,4.3427,1.682,5.5902,0.3647,2.3425,6.0768,0.1563,0.306,3.7765,1.9391,0.2957,0.2872,6.3761,0.6173,2.7534,8.8979,8.9191,0.1947,6.9325,1.871,0.2683,7.153,1.4119,1.0172,5.007,0.6119,1.1541,2.1828,2.4016,0.9812,1.4365,0.0002,5.4316,5.2189,1.3127,3.9419,0.0045,4.4477,1.1776,4.9576,7.5406,0.0777,2.5445,0.5936,1.5604,4.7621,2.518,7.2762,3.5749,3.7472,1.2944,1.4875,0.0012,1.6154,3.6006,3.3834,6.4634,0.4914,1.1156,4.1253,3.0786,1.4952,0.2916,4.8888,1.8057,3.5762,8.6909,8.6792,3.5709,0.0483,0.0724,2.8765,6.6936,3.3215,2.8633,5.9498,8.8093,0.3083,1.4993,1.9267,1.6091,6.2623,0.9772,2.4746,1.1149,4.3197,1.3922,5.0329,5.4394,4.7648,0.3955,1.3671,7.4667,0.0584,0.0631,0.0004,0.9414,1.9101,0.1767,6.6422,1.3645,0.0302,5.2221,0.515,4.4165,0.0463,1.1519,1.4054,3.1511,4.226,4.6031,7.8133,0.7303,0.0013,3.1961,5.2777,8.2589,0.0998,4.2554,11.0089,8.7376,6.384,6.9728,1.6273,0.0121,5.2893,7.832,1.174,2.1428,6.5947,3.3154,4.491,0.139,7.4474,0.0015,0.0008,5.9983,0.116,3.9336,2.4253,2.6125,2.3827,2.2725,1.929,5.4296,0.0149,6.8657,9.736,5.048,6.7125,1.1861]}
{"id":4997,"ended":true,"length":297,"text":"The hopes of the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither with the end of the slave trade in the British Empire, nor did the living conditions of the enslaved improve. The trade in slaves flourished on the Caribbean islands, where they were forced to work for life. The island of Nevis, off the coast of the Leeward Islands, had a virtual plantation society in which children of mixed parentage did not have any official registration. These children were kidnapped by African slave traders, brought to the island and put to work as slaves in the sugarcane estates. The island also became a staging and hiding place for escaped slaves and one of the bases for the development of slave rebellions. One of the oldest slaving families in the island had connections in Philadelphia and was a major player in the slave trade to West Africa. The first major rebellion on the island occurred at a slaving settlement in 1763 led by Jacob Marley, who was also a captain of a slave ship. He is also known for his prediction that Jesus Christ will return before the slaves rise up and free themselves.\n\nMarley was killed shortly before the rebellion ended. The slave revolt has had some significance for the abolitionist and civil rights movement. In 1968, a monument commemorating the rebellion was erected in Castries where it is believed the rebellion began.\n\nAbout\n\nThe Black Perspective is an online journal that offers news and commentary from a black liberation perspective.

{"id":4703,"ended":true,"length":289,"text":"Mazzetta and colleagues ( 1998, 1999 ) presumed that Carnotaurus was a swift runner, arguing that the thigh bone was adapted to withstand high bending moments while running. The ability of an animal to run on the ground was a necessary trait if it was a carnivore. Running, the authors said, was essential to ensure a proper kill, as it would be inefficient if Carnotaurus used its hands to eat (i.e., the hand would require significant space ). The ability to run on land thus would have allowed Carnotaurus to remain in water.\n\nThe problem with this theory is that, if Carnotaurus had such a flexible hip, how could it use its arms to keep up with its long, thin tail that was often fully upright and moving? In Carnotaurus, the hind limb is usually shorter than the fore limb ; there was no good reason to suggest that Carnotaurus could have run much faster than most dinosaurs (Mazzetta and colleagues 1998 ).\n\nIt is not very often that fossil evidence is used to demonstrate what a dinosaur did in life. For example, an article that was published with the announcement of the discovery of a dinosaur skeleton referred to the skeleton as \u201can extremely agile\u201d animal (Gorringe et al. 2001 : p. 9). The fossil skeleton, which was found in France in the Middle Jurassic (i.e. about 152 million years old ), was shown to actually be a plant-eating sauropod and therefore would not have known agility (Gorringe et al. 2001a : p. 9).","token_len":322,"entropy":[10.0564,5.1781,3.1511,7.2245,3.9004,8.42,4.9514,1.7137,1.6609,10.6397,0.3581,10.8205,2.0073,7.1443,2.2262,1.3925,9.3387,5.6195,1.6127,9.3254,0.114,2.0002,9.2416,3.0799,1.7936,6.4118,0.6515,5.2892,3.6353,9.0228,7.8169,4.5494,2.956,0.9652,2.5329,5.9381,1.5616,5.2424,1.4744,0.3668,3.5544,3.4755,2.1833,2.7377,1.9443,3.1683,5.8224,4.6777,6.0236,0.822,0.6319,5.1516,5.9835,0.927,1.1689,7.9894,3.6808,4.4216,1.6916,4.3008,0.0199,1.5017,4.3599,1.1199,6.2042,2.3038,5.1993,9.8811,2.8295,2.8447,1.553,2.2948,2.8722,5.7539,3.8837,3.1425,0.0031,0.0267,5.0069,0.684,5.1317,0.4064,7.1209,5.0487,4.0609,0.0013,0.0005,0.2241,2.7275,2.8332,2.1409,6.7721,6.1328,5.6601,8.8182,2.4469,4.399,0.6671,1.2617,1.4591,4.6114,6.6261,4.2006,2.5209,4.238,0.9127,0.0012,0.025,0.1515,5.2155,2.1714,4.8742,3.17,1.5125,0.0008,2.0018,6.2834,0.8457,1.3456,2.7331,0.5678,0.0957,3.2537,3.4789,0.6854,0.0024,0.0159,2.1432,5.8734,0.6128,5.2855,3.2472,1.7707,4.3555,0.7463,0.4752,4.0499,0.6724,3.7463,0.3831,4.7379,1.5652,0.3376,2.1449,4.6084,3.2696,4.6661,4.9696,5.0957,2.113,4.7291,7.2633,7.1368,2.447,6.4525,2.341,3.0828,5.9108,0.0034,0.0479,0.8528,0.9976,3.1497,2.783,2.6262,4.1634,5.7377,0.4199,0.1952,3.0134,1.7078,9.6129,5.2871,2.4145,1.0827,6.4947,1.1637,0.8703,3.5642,0.2496,1.4678,0.0013,0.0215,1.495,2.2347,6.6086,5.4676,1.5155,1.0518,5.0749,5.508,2.0428,5.6192,0.7687,0.0014,0.3165,0.2317,2.1379,3.1229,1.93,0.0002,4.025,0.873,2.667,6.1593,5.0122,0.3259,6.6296,2.8152,2.0543,2.4126,0.1903,4.692,4.7167,2.3781,1.5567,2.988,2.5662,3.8769,0.5941,2.6565,0.3781,0.0206,5.0582,3.2615,4.3202,2.2553,0.41,6.8159,1.3151,7.3165,0.736,0.6886,1.281,0.0976,2.148,2.2763,2.5162,7.1657,0.0422,1.9725,4.7292,0.8753,12.5358,7.5623,4.8491,5.2713,5.5818,8.979,7.2913,4.2501,1.729,5.0615,5.1527,11.8093,1.6518,0.0028,0.2462,3.304,6.4568,4.3694,0.2098,4.228,1.7009,2.0682,5.2005,3.4548,2.8807,2.0251,1.332,2.3175,0.8534,5.3749,1.7157,2.2739,5.8617,1.5803,1.8103,5.0148,0.0022,0.0024,3.7397,2.9605,9.3521,0.2511,0.0185,2.6947,2.9461,1.3939,5.0239,0.1869,6.9749,0.9812,1.3953,8.1663,1.6932,0.9936,7.0993,0.0777,0.0323,4.5357,3.9839,3.941,1.8666,0.7273,5.7456,13.0806,2.4325,1.6065,0.0136,0.0025,0.2173,0.0013,0.0264,0.0246,4.5992,1.9165,0.1494,0.0026,1.8727,0.2283]}

{"id":3969,"ended":false,"length":273,"text":"The grants were only given for the tunnel to Bjor\u00f8y, and not for the necessary roads that would connect Tyss\u00f8y to Bjor\u00f8y. This caused local controversy, as some people on Bjor\u00f8y disagreed with the grant, fearing that it would have an impact on the landscape.  The first section of road connecting the islands, the E18, opened on 25 January 1985. Several years later, an extension of the E18 was opened on 5 May 1992. The opening of the extension allowed local traffic to bypass the E18, allowing the tunnel to be used solely for freight.\n\nThe remaining  tunnel was scheduled and approved for opening on Friday 3 March 1989. On that day, the old road through the tunnel was demolished, but the demolition team became stuck below the tunnel on Bjor\u00f8y. The work to recover the team stalled for several weeks; in April 1989, the tunnel was opened, with heavy traffic. On the same day, the island ferry Bergenland was scheduled to leave the island by rail for the first time since 1952. In that connection, ferries from Eiker and Voss were laid up to sail by boat to Bjor\u00f8y for a few days.\n\nThe second ferry to Bjor\u00f8y, Bergenland, took her first trip from Bergen on 5 October 1990.

{"id":3136,"ended":true,"length":292,"text":"A large grasshopper such as a locust can jump about a metre ( twenty body lengths ) without using its wings ; the acceleration peaks at about 20 g. Grasshoppers jump by extending their hind legs, bending their knees and rolling forward. Once in a rolling position they lift their forelegs off the ground, keeping contact with the ground only by their hind legs, and then springing through the air. A cricket (which has no wings) can jump about ten body lengths if it uses its legs for propulsion, and can also jump around two times this distance.\n\nThe largest land animal to ever jump, the Tyrannosaurus rex, could only jump about 3.2 m (110 body lengths ) (although this may have been a jumping display). Its maximum speed was 740 kilometres per hour ; as to its greatest length its weight is unknown, but was likely similar to that of the adult Triceratops. However, it certainly didn't jump like a grasshopper.\n\nOther animals with very small or small wings use springy flight, in which their wings beat at such a rate that they are barely visible with the naked eye.\n\nCarrying capacity of insects, like locusts, is limited and is much lower than that of other animals like cattle; however, this is offset by the low energy costs of maintenance.\n\nIn insects, an egg is laid as soon as it is fertilized, and there is no need to wait out the cold period necessary to produce an embryo. This allows an almost immediate start when the weather warms up again.","token_len":325,"entropy":[7.7616,9.2952,3.0791,0.0083,8.0569,0.0109,1.2408,8.1699,0.0733,2.5037,6.3633,4.538,3.3141,2.1227,2.833,14.6587,9.7562,0.4429,2.0934,4.32,4.4045,1.4723,2.9602,8.2111,2.6934,10.6143,9.3191,1.5228,1.466,3.5779,5.659,2.5443,7.4607,0.009,0.2427,5.7625,3.725,6.5008,0.1993,4.0385,0.5568,2.109,6.8233,0.8749,2.5598,1.2906,6.2108,2.9184,1.4631,5.5327,3.3343,1.5828,10.0522,2.7594,2.4623,4.9053,0.6576,3.8654,1.4451,0.0762,4.09,0.4934,0.0193,1.5455,5.4368,8.1846,0.1926,0.6103,0.1303,6.6179,2.7759,3.4167,2.0251,0.2775,2.0134,1.4908,1.612,7.2446,3.2227,6.9987,0.4728,0.3506,1.6472,3.1831,6.7619,4.8626,4.7869,2.5112,2.6071,1.2698,0.5453,1.3563,2.2906,2.2015,3.4715,6.215,0.0344,4.3658,1.1849,4.8836,0.2101,3.008,2.5471,3.0629,1.7369,1.4542,2.9709,2.0935,1.6946,5.0055,4.4375,4.7158,5.9418,1.6619,1.121,2.0054,0.0344,1.966,5.612,4.1402,2.1129,4.293,1.5591,4.6465,2.7665,1.2433,7.9417,0.0393,0.1691,0.0025,0.5155,4.9105,2.963,2.2935,1.5411,5.2532,1.1113,2.9693,2.4713,1.2019,8.4503,7.4426,0.0305,3.1166,4.5849,4.7071,3.0082,2.9785,1.3263,0.3241,2.7591,8.5172,8.7566,1.7801,3.1859,5.1087,1.6122,0.756,4.8015,4.956,4.6973,0.2883,0.0245,5.6146,5.1455,6.1522,1.4832,6.3574,4.5205,5.9589,5.4413,2.2941,5.1583,1.6708,0.5783,6.1035,4.2805,6.7079,0.1104,0.7469,0.04,1.1455,7.1126,6.1403,0.0385,0.0004,0.0,1.0499,4.2614,0.2618,1.7178,6.0021,5.0403,0.0004,3.2903,2.4085,1.2903,5.8737,0.0003,0.0004,1.2223,1.2672,0.0004,5.0475,2.5138,3.0003,5.0272,2.6277,4.2451,3.4619,0.7131,7.5761,9.4871,5.3749,4.9646,1.9662,4.4828,0.191,2.1678,1.2996,8.1941,4.1905,6.524,0.8532,1.0497,0.2058,0.4229,2.9981,4.7457,2.806,5.7099,1.4061,0.153,0.0156,0.436,2.1711,0.0003,4.463,5.8049,0.0977,7.8016,2.6895,3.9996,2.9608,4.0377,6.1193,0.0195,0.0205,0.5974,1.4067,2.2625,3.7972,2.9906,4.7414,2.1095,0.3535,1.1497,0.0426,2.9326,2.7791,5.3131,5.1695,4.8953,2.0089,0.1932,3.7592,1.228,7.6928,0.1201,0.8943,5.6359,4.5362,3.9451,0.3323,8.036,1.2222,1.256,0.0003,3.521,4.6679,0.5021,5.1608,4.1699,1.2438,2.2377,4.6284,1.5759,0.0067,0.8076,0.7197,2.2139,1.2852,1.2757,1.2975,4.388,0.6295,1.2336,1.1868,0.7286,2.4286,6.1101,0.7388,6.3034,5.8142,9.0864,0.679,2.346,2.8548,2.4592,0.4464,3.2653,3.592,3.4423,6.4866,4.5987,4.6001,5.2968,1.0073,6.1369,5.3318,0.0036,0.7343,5.0023,0.8063]}

They departed in a northeasterly direction, the destroyers keeping about 4 knots while the small boats kept their speed up to 15 knots.\n\nAt 21 : 00 four Swordfish aircraft attacked, with the bombers scoring hits on all three destroyers. Two Swordfish later joined in the attack and the two destroyers were hit very heavily. HMS Glasgow suffered a direct and five glancing hits while HMS Cornwall suffered four hits and two glancing. HMS Belfast did not see any aircraft but later noted that four Swordfish had attacked her and had fired flares to disrupt her attempts at locating them.\n\nAfter the attack, there was no response from the convoy.

{"id":4795,"ended":true,"length":263,"text":"Although a state of hostilities existed between the Mam and the K 'iche'of Q 'umarkaj after the rebellion of the Kaqchikel against their former K 'iche'allies prior to European contact, the tribes were on reasonably friendly terms until the late 1800s, when the Q 'umarkaj were at the point of collapse while the Mam were expanding their territory. The Mam allied forces besieged their former \"friends\" at Q 'umarkaj (Cayapas). They failed to capture the town and the K 'iche'defended themselves, but nevertheless this siege became very important for the Mam, for it allowed them to collect information on the Q 'umarkaj's capabilities.\n\nThe following year (1897) the K 'iche'army attacked and defeated the Mam army in a battle to recover Q 'umarkaj town. The loss of Q 'umarkaj was the Mam's first major defeat after the fall of Xaltocan (1793). After the Q 'umarkaj had lost both Q 'umarkaj and Xaltocan, they signed an alliance with the Mexican forces with the goal of regaining their provinces. A series of battles, negotiations and failed attempts ensued. In 1912 the Mexican army took over Xaltocan and the Mam lost their last major battle, that was fought in 1914 in which more than 300 Mam were killed. In 1915 the Mam accepted a final treaty giving almost all of their territory north of the Ch'orti rivers to Mexico and ceding their territory west of the Chiapas river to Guatemala.","token_len":328,"entropy":[3.364,6.1319,2.7227,7.3904,4.7509,0.9759,1.1606,10.0197,8.4452,0.9257,5.0719,13.191,12.8159,5.2779,10.1037,8.1741,5.6371,7.1663,8.0893,7.1748,7.6231,0.6183,5.9922,1.5,1.5356,7.7136,4.2115,6.7266,7.6505,3.3143,5.3013,3.7699,3.9309,5.749,2.4118,0.7051,2.6379,8.4124,3.2441,8.8148,0.0115,10.6827,4.1413,0.6145,1.1329,7.1587,2.1432,5.9568,9.717,3.0253,0.0075,5.048,0.7205,4.4822,3.9825,0.2416,1.8262,0.2799,0.9663,4.2592,0.8062,0.4084,0.0153,0.0212,2.618,5.7726,2.4162,3.4516,0.2276,5.5598,6.1618,0.4705,1.6405,2.6605,6.0738,0.8362,1.3517,1.0456,1.8117,1.8463,8.0663,5.1157,7.835,3.4791,2.8111,6.8571,6.2686,0.3763,3.4893,3.6063,0.3184,0.0552,0.0036,0.0292,3.5206,4.7624,4.3102,5.8588,5.0772,3.6643,3.1365,6.3754,0.1031,3.1624,0.974,3.0076,2.3006,2.6732,2.5707,0.1742,0.197,8.8717,7.9067,10.2167,2.6493,2.5925,1.6873,6.2576,7.1938,6.6244,4.9306,4.3495,3.5302,1.6559,0.5743,0.8133,2.5007,4.166,1.7606,3.1538,0.5956,0.2658,6.6279,5.255,1.353,0.6645,2.8654,0.0907,0.0249,0.006,0.033,1.8195,5.5377,1.4487,1.9609,0.1625,1.5167,5.312,2.0941,4.47,0.8777,4.1627,1.2918,0.8936,2.8014,0.264,0.0641,2.751,9.666,0.8457,3.515,3.6623,2.7665,0.4958,0.7471,3.2776,1.6373,2.1996,2.0245,4.4394,7.5636,4.2132,0.0635,0.0096,0.0023,0.0216,7.4186,1.0548,1.2392,7.089,0.2241,0.8184,0.0353,0.0098,0.0021,0.0078,1.5165,2.3079,4.5523,0.1475,1.6517,1.3152,0.9771,4.4955,0.9563,3.0971,0.0125,7.5743,8.0868,7.2238,3.6157,2.8966,3.899,3.2895,1.4909,3.7495,0.8969,5.1215,0.1102,0.0587,0.0045,0.0144,2.3482,3.1575,4.6981,3.0932,0.1827,0.0687,0.0228,0.0235,0.3132,2.9905,0.0591,0.0189,0.0051,0.6907,2.4136,7.2577,1.893,1.6562,0.4831,0.5073,8.981,4.3517,5.7909,0.5862,2.5655,0.0251,4.1266,0.0269,2.0708,7.1269,0.6632,4.533,4.5132,0.0008,2.6317,3.4933,8.9153,0.824,7.7211,2.1548,7.195,1.8282,2.5411,6.677,1.0421,4.2416,1.4316,4.3364,2.132,2.7756,0.005,0.0052,0.0032,1.1284,1.8667,0.6525,3.7254,2.6747,2.5442,2.008,1.2742,2.3324,4.3232,4.0459,2.2946,0.9691,3.3484,3.6796,2.6888,6.1332,0.1482,3.3461,1.3976,2.7518,0.2788,0.6793,2.7468,2.7454,0.6542,0.5247,6.1917,1.7431,6.9825,3.8392,5.6597,8.6785,0.6557,0.4248,0.7975,1.1535,6.1517,0.2765,1.0298,4.9368,6.5078,8.621,3.5436,5.7875,0.703,2.2176,2.1856,6.9261,4.0391,2.7718,2.3962,3.9597,0.6787,0.5023,5.3912,0.0675,0.003,2.7257,0.4124,7.3791,0.3886]}

A coastal fort was erected by the Umayyad Caliph Abd al @ - @ in the year 653, between the islands of Elounda and Naxos, and the town of Azotus grew until a Christian settlement was established in 711, following the Byzantine conquest of the island. A later Christian community was established on the west coast of the island in 801. In 880, during the Crusaders' occupation of the island, a mosque was built and a mausoleum.\n\nIn 1204, during the Crusaders' siege of the capital Rhodes, the town fell to the Venetians. The town remained under Venetian rule for the rest of the Middle Ages. After the defeat of the Venetian fleet by a fleet under Andrea Doria in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the town fell under Ottoman rule for the rest of the Middle Ages. It was occupied by the French in the course of the Eighty Years' War (1618\u20131648); the settlement was again fortified by British troops in 1830. The French, during World War II, placed anti-tank emplacements in strategic areas.\n\nOn 14 October 1944 the first battle of Azotus took place in which more than 300 British and 2,500 Greek soldiers were killed. The following week the beachhead was secured after the assault on the village of Elisia and the surrounding villages, and the island was retaken on 19 October.","token_len":328,"entropy":[11.4744,0.1308,10.0757,2.9205,5.7161,4.2165,5.9962,7.3537,10.0836,8.3048,3.8413,9.0731,6.0221,1.1954,5.4919,0.0419,0.1573,1.6512,0.3648,2.2579,4.4002,1.4328,6.1701,1.1174,0.6682,4.8167,10.1061,5.624,2.5871,3.0885,2.7489,1.1342,6.4916,0.2361,0.0121,0.2577,1.6305,0.6709,4.0353,1.063,15.8705,7.8183,5.3906,6.4103,1.5134,4.3541,2.5951,4.2812,1.6052,7.3943,1.4683,8.1804,0.0733,6.9774,11.2272,3.2791,0.2439,4.7277,5.4997,1.5428,1.7523,1.3782,2.5633,4.5397,0.3688,4.3824,1.8256,0.4766,7.1372,3.8338,4.1085,4.1234,3.4419,0.9709,1.1051,1.3321,3.2415,4.0058,2.0025,5.3987,0.6207,5.6857,0.7869,0.6583,2.0371,1.862,1.1789,3.9705,5.3,1.6266,5.0361,1.3578,1.0051,2.418,0.8983,5.1406,0.9728,0.2367,1.0297,1.0077,2.8263,1.8258,3.3706,1.1638,2.8592,1.8749,6.6866,0.615,4.6901,0.3653,3.1972,4.1731,0.224,3.2927,0.1293,1.3228,1.7356,0.5387,2.312,4.2655,0.2848,0.5758,3.3579,1.6447,7.4669,0.1083,0.0002,0.0001,5.5562,2.6242,0.0553,2.4101,4.3864,3.7109,0.2783,3.7996,0.2323,1.6825,1.1488,0.0447,3.6042,0.2787,1.4605,4.8387,13.4587,0.4106,1.4331,3.1537,6.7045,1.2859,0.4884,6.879,0.0209,0.4448,1.0113,1.4033,3.028,3.3713,1.7284,4.2088,0.0124,0.0798,0.7488,1.8618,2.7437,2.418,0.0007,0.2271,3.3367,0.0429,0.7151,3.993,0.6227,3.5121,0.0552,0.3686,1.8563,0.0105,1.8328,3.8531,2.4682,4.0248,4.1355,6.5918,10.4721,4.9168,3.571,1.3464,3.0202,2.8269,0.0037,4.1193,0.2666,0.8237,4.4296,5.0149,0.0622,0.8034,1.8121,3.0314,1.8846,3.0462,0.4235,3.9537,0.8963,0.7529,0.0006,0.0554,0.3476,0.0027,0.2282,3.1806,1.0595,4.9848,0.2591,0.985,4.8961,1.4307,1.5699,7.4317,0.0008,0.316,8.1114,4.0771,0.279,0.4944,0.046,2.5794,1.7616,4.1682,1.8371,2.0198,4.6441,5.181,1.7423,8.1497,1.262,5.2761,5.3057,0.745,4.7061,1.5154,0.7824,7.7983,0.4974,1.9369,2.9993,3.7273,5.158,4.3357,0.0092,1.0595,0.0973,6.611,7.1178,0.0168,6.2755,6.2615,0.0083,0.0388,1.304,7.5916,2.0908,3.0552,1.2804,0.0002,4.5592,3.7018,2.3083,2.3871,2.8487,4.5805,4.8082,0.4768,6.4499,0.2075,0.0363,1.8302,0.004,1.4431,2.7352,4.7941,0.0238,3.3798,2.1476,1.5666,5.095,0.3409,1.7752,5.105,1.7273,0.7904,0.1778,0.5665,1.2742,5.2877,4.3203,1.6927,8.0836,0.9226,1.7196,5.1288,5.2772,1.7269,5.6701,1.5145,1.1786,3.9754,0.4442,5.0582,8.2007,5.1816,3.1559,0.9913,5.7373,2.4203,2.3773,1.8172,1.2598,5.6007,0.6605,5.5501,0.0081,3.024,3.4942,1.4968,0.8384]}

A quarry started operation in the southern part of the site in 1902; a residential neighbourhood grew in the middle to late 20th century, and large mining enterprises, coal and asbestos mines have operated on the northern part of the site since 1950. The impact of these activities on the local landscape and the water body has been extensive. The site has been transformed from a natural landscape to an industrial site in the past century. It has become one of the most polluted and contaminated industrial waste sites of Poland.\n\nMain purpose of the work is to investigate the groundwater levels and the effects of groundwater extraction on ground water movement in the former quarry site in the south. The investigation was completed by means of surface water\/saline and borehole samplings, which were conducted by a multidisciplinary team.\n\nResults provided by the sampling carried out on the site shows that the groundwater in areas containing both bedrock and quarry sediment, as well as in the areas below ground level is very poorly managed, with a potential flow direction towards the surface. A series of possible pathways that could lead to the surface were identified and discussed, including infiltration, infiltration and surface water flow. The investigation also shows that the extraction of groundwater in former quarry may influence the groundwater levels in adjacent lands, as extraction and movement of ground water in this region is not limited to the extraction of groundwater in the quarry itself.\n\nThe research aims to improve the capacity for monitoring of groundwater quality in the surrounding area which is important for the sustainable groundwater management.","token_len":332,"entropy":[3.0044,13.6313,8.8713,6.4893,5.3445,9.03,6.1506,1.8208,0.6554,12.9314,13.6907,3.5279,7.6206,0.0887,3.2607,6.0893,5.1963,0.0445,6.0845,10.2968,0.9608,10.6519,9.3749,3.3279,0.937,0.9532,4.0982,1.1717,4.3698,10.4603,7.3122,6.0489,1.1525,3.0578,8.0057,0.8898,0.025,0.8389,2.2446,1.3321,4.7637,4.6553,2.8057,8.1638,6.1822,7.702,2.1003,1.5891,4.0975,5.8298,9.5399,2.9418,0.0227,0.0799,2.2644,1.5004,6.6595,5.4398,4.4561,4.0339,7.3018,1.9054,7.4,2.2958,3.2428,3.8174,2.5103,0.59,6.256,1.5708,0.488,0.2103,0.1685,1.3087,4.5577,0.2295,1.8205,6.1129,0.8707,1.9694,3.0603,1.5182,0.4854,4.329,2.9328,2.4328,1.4137,5.5168,6.2876,1.5716,0.5493,4.0401,0.9336,1.8698,2.7481,1.315,1.0242,5.3694,1.7796,0.6124,4.4227,3.5188,1.4944,1.8267,0.8011,2.3405,3.046,0.9665,3.5623,2.8945,1.041,3.2353,1.2181,2.4369,3.354,0.0147,0.1396,1.0246,3.2977,2.1197,2.9571,5.4026,7.2431,0.7255,4.0414,9.9612,0.8049,1.9976,0.0166,6.5628,7.1026,0.7122,1.1817,4.3127,1.5407,0.2265,3.6546,0.6543,6.3664,3.7104,2.0065,2.2199,3.0149,0.3787,4.295,4.6982,1.0026,8.0746,0.5636,7.1883,2.4651,0.6524,5.8152,4.1439,1.5469,3.7704,1.2687,3.1354,2.0695,1.2429,5.7666,3.2714,3.7113,1.4581,5.5361,0.0044,6.6483,1.3959,7.1948,4.5622,3.2142,3.8779,6.1958,0.1169,8.0205,1.7495,1.9945,2.0649,1.3298,2.8788,1.6696,2.6273,7.1754,0.0787,0.0013,0.1326,1.953,2.1416,0.0002,4.2703,7.6141,0.5355,0.8134,5.1456,6.8487,0.0052,1.9988,0.6201,1.2802,4.8105,0.5822,1.4357,1.3152,3.7399,6.7494,4.9399,5.3584,6.9059,0.1939,7.2763,4.5614,3.7982,2.4153,0.0266,0.0047,2.2691,1.2698,4.3228,3.8283,2.1804,2.9347,6.393,3.7248,7.587,4.1645,1.9415,1.6408,2.5618,4.6757,8.2063,7.9803,6.0419,0.7159,3.099,1.7385,3.8792,4.6425,0.0037,7.1419,4.2454,4.0191,1.3815,1.9258,0.0896,2.0579,6.2899,7.6027,1.2426,2.3814,6.1431,2.3563,1.8777,6.1206,2.3573,2.5716,2.8171,4.3596,2.1419,3.2214,1.0365,1.5252,5.686,1.8765,2.7169,0.338,1.2909,5.8782,0.6659,1.1733,2.5336,7.8744,0.541,7.2257,6.1751,0.8849,2.3655,2.7792,1.2096,3.965,5.4697,1.4983,2.8032,9.3578,3.3198,5.502,0.4616,5.8835,0.0612,3.063,3.2822,2.6934,2.0202,2.9248,4.904,0.2552,1.5657,6.3853,0.2358,1.4838,1.7562,0.9519,3.7275,4.422,0.3207,0.9573,0.0002,1.6088,4.4092,5.3424,0.2068,4.0063,0.5917,6.8603,4.1889,3.1088,1.6863,0.3801,3.9969,1.4695,0.5034,4.4812,1.1392,6.0119,1.2991,4.1977,0.4566,1.1649,4.6686,7.4458,1.1859,2.3569]}

{"id":65,"ended":true,"length":295,"text":"The structure of Dominican society was hierarchical, with strongly gendered roles. Rafael Trujillo, the ruler, was a cruel dictator who haunts the people of Santo Domingo even 35 years after his death. Yet, the history of Dominica is intertwined with the history of Rafael Trujillo. It is the story of the emergence of a country and of the transition out of the Caribbean's first and most brutal colony. The book is organized around three major themes : the revolution ; the colonial period ; and postcolonial society. In each of these, the author builds a powerful narrative that is interspersed with valuable and relevant archival material. The first chapter looks at the process of industrialization in the early stages of the Haitian Revolution. The second examines the slave movement in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, as well as the efforts to defend Dominican slaveholders from the uprising. The third describes a dramatic political struggle between Dominicans and Haitians after the Haitian Revolution, in which Dominican patriots were among the first black and brown nation's leaders to be killed by French troops. After the revolution, the Haitian army occupied Santo Domingo. The chapter on Dominican resistance describes the role of Afro-Dominicans, some of whom became major political figures and political prisoners, particularly in post-independence Haiti : Joachim Lisser, a poet, priest and former slave who became Minister of the Interior, and Toussaint Louverture, the Haitian revolutionary leader who united blacks and whites against France. The last chapter discusses the political and social conditions in Haiti after independence, which prompted the Haitian diaspora to return to their homeland.","token_len":334,"entropy":[8.8709,0.6056,13.5872,2.8734,2.6593,7.2812,1.0013,2.0545,10.5143,7.9343,0.3126,2.1591,1.8694,12.061,6.1024,0.0006,0.0001,1.3109,1.9261,6.8895,3.0137,1.1564,1.5128,9.0814,3.7556,1.1945,12.9113,0.0349,0.9135,4.3273,1.1888,6.2463,0.0285,0.1077,0.0022,0.0017,5.9947,13.9311,0.1249,0.3765,0.7193,0.5673,0.3569,5.3905,1.687,2.5225,5.4555,0.1002,4.7885,5.0581,1.3276,6.3519,0.1702,0.9848,1.234,0.0273,9.6044,0.1566,0.0035,0.0014,0.9578,3.4996,0.6028,2.7555,1.6662,0.0522,1.5251,5.642,0.1555,1.1592,5.1611,4.1984,2.4177,1.0907,5.8155,6.7307,0.0497,1.6884,6.9959,5.0771,5.256,4.3137,2.1763,3.2137,7.8482,0.7575,2.4893,5.4195,1.7951,5.9238,1.9414,2.1103,3.2293,1.0694,7.8498,1.6729,5.4472,10.4609,0.3218,6.2435,2.5922,0.6345,0.1474,8.1471,1.229,4.0245,0.3126,3.0367,3.4516,1.1259,0.2109,3.3087,1.0235,2.6535,5.049,2.0326,5.3899,1.4058,1.7362,2.7352,4.6968,3.4686,0.0045,0.2472,8.4821,3.3877,4.2774,6.2732,0.078,1.0257,0.4468,1.6962,3.3335,3.2114,6.1575,0.1665,0.4959,5.5106,0.7825,7.5642,0.1145,1.9748,0.66,2.274,6.3121,0.0601,0.4985,6.6032,0.366,1.1452,1.0601,0.4301,4.2533,0.3279,6.8362,6.3596,1.6317,1.6519,1.3782,0.9164,4.5637,0.4101,1.7581,2.76,0.1072,0.0069,0.6054,6.0294,2.3625,5.6615,4.4619,5.4011,3.8219,1.3907,1.302,7.7166,1.3851,0.6136,0.074,5.7515,3.1434,6.0543,4.9672,3.4409,0.7948,4.6203,0.2053,0.3098,4.5302,0.0034,5.564,0.4809,3.1432,0.2236,1.8131,2.602,0.1553,4.8126,6.9658,0.0032,2.5012,5.48,0.1504,0.3997,8.7449,4.5572,5.9409,7.813,5.3295,2.9717,1.8386,2.9423,4.5689,1.6046,4.0274,2.3812,0.6826,5.4605,0.9852,1.7465,0.2081,1.1215,4.3012,4.8499,4.7858,5.0871,0.001,0.0193,0.0,0.0004,2.2191,1.458,5.4643,3.791,3.8751,3.7438,6.4232,0.6078,3.8103,0.2848,8.1638,0.5592,0.1112,3.0865,0.7829,2.3029,5.7565,0.2114,0.2806,3.8863,5.4969,2.3984,1.1253,2.772,2.7968,4.0857,2.6947,6.0887,0.8234,6.2834,1.3028,4.0859,0.7805,8.1192,9.0584,3.8207,0.0025,4.3409,5.9508,3.9103,0.9014,1.6473,6.1356,1.2893,6.7775,1.3332,3.7744,3.8108,4.2838,2.5169,7.8993,0.2295,2.4807,1.4973,1.5845,2.5806,6.1458,5.145,0.2575,0.0082,6.2639,5.8656,0.1909,0.2743,2.1726,5.2957,4.3638,1.0267,1.2312,9.1047,7.656,0.6968,1.7738,2.7433,4.2047,1.0047,2.109,4.6627,0.6386,3.2881,0.5387,3.5151,1.9392,1.4052,3.7818,1.5714,1.0559,1.8448,5.3137,1.2616,2.9499,5.9217,0.9741,2.5245,7.0104,0.0054,0.0112,0.2081,2.8821,0.2749,2.7959,1.4094,0.6016]}

He recorded one album with them titled Bless the Sick, which was received positively by many of the critics who wrote for local reviews. Scogin later said that he left the band because of vocalist Jonathan Davis, who, according to Scogin \"was an asshole and didn't give a f**k about the band\". The group recorded the follow-up to Bless the Sick, titled All the Kings Horses. During a recording session in Atlanta, Georgia on May 6, 2008, Scogin walked out of the studio as the rest of the band had left and had never played with the band again.\n\nThe band was formed in late 2004. The line-up consisted of Josh Scogin - Vocals, Guitar; Matt Zona - Bass, Backing Vocals; Ben O'Connor -Guitar; Mark Pellington -Drums. It was originally announced that Josh Scogin would be the full-time singer for the band, but shortly before the recording of their first album, it was decided that Scogin would leave to form Norma Jean and he was replaced by guitarist Mark Pellington.\n\nJosh Scogin is a singer\/guitarist in a band called The Chariot. He originally left Norma Jean to form the Chariot, but after the release of their first album Scogin was asked to rejoin Norma Jean but he declined. Pellington would then become the full time singer.","token_len":334,"entropy":[8.1091,4.1715,0.7111,5.2046,5.8826,1.5793,8.7235,7.4112,4.8079,0.7867,8.9306,2.1369,0.2598,5.713,3.3623,5.0654,4.8661,12.0744,1.5101,8.4715,2.2929,3.9395,6.794,4.3924,1.956,2.9173,0.3862,9.9469,1.7113,0.2457,2.6815,0.4806,2.9423,5.0719,4.5221,2.2727,2.3938,5.1575,6.4254,9.5495,2.0831,8.074,1.5174,1.6396,1.4681,6.4865,3.0404,0.6981,2.0757,2.5054,0.739,5.1664,2.4293,4.2507,4.367,8.1366,8.5706,0.8422,3.9222,0.0041,0.0008,3.672,4.6075,1.0201,0.8533,5.2094,0.9958,0.196,2.2174,1.4129,6.7569,2.6337,6.0837,5.5364,1.5264,0.6485,5.3012,2.7542,0.0005,2.6441,0.0068,0.0006,6.6524,1.6964,3.986,2.0169,2.1832,3.7875,0.0003,3.2108,0.4501,3.7397,2.1121,0.1772,1.0556,1.9231,1.1604,3.7384,2.9536,2.9696,5.1544,2.6681,3.0872,0.4137,0.0049,1.0921,1.5315,0.0227,0.0012,1.6511,3.1932,5.7393,2.3561,7.2621,8.7405,1.6645,5.2037,2.9883,3.1078,0.1189,2.1477,2.9605,0.6907,2.4558,2.9416,2.3245,3.4564,0.4222,3.6908,0.1143,0.7118,0.0036,0.0015,5.9318,2.2051,0.4342,0.3501,1.1431,4.9675,1.4951,5.2961,0.0347,0.2148,0.3334,3.2131,1.4509,2.268,4.5891,5.009,2.6465,2.8931,1.0833,0.7701,0.884,0.1598,1.7067,0.0065,2.6481,1.5712,2.3833,3.0054,1.1795,4.0084,4.0596,2.3285,1.9821,7.9642,1.0207,0.0284,1.3973,0.028,3.3819,0.3563,0.0106,0.0005,6.6201,4.8305,0.0012,0.465,4.4864,4.8985,4.5283,5.3108,8.0444,0.4904,1.1378,0.9933,8.6301,2.0944,1.376,0.0019,0.8331,4.7902,5.2884,0.7185,1.6859,0.1249,12.3665,0.0234,0.053,0.6621,4.8017,5.1377,7.4021,1.7268,0.076,3.8963,0.0052,2.9256,4.0397,0.6436,4.2644,4.1872,0.6826,2.8166,1.2305,0.0065,0.001,0.3048,1.1503,2.5478,6.9283,0.5355,0.0426,5.0126,2.0245,0.5244,0.4791,1.3732,0.5569,6.2346,2.6743,1.0542,3.858,1.2676,4.9379,1.1661,0.7106,0.6773,3.5444,0.2153,2.4963,0.5809,2.6348,0.0179,0.002,0.3792,4.5484,3.0674,3.4876,5.7504,0.0044,0.0188,2.8376,5.1918,2.0474,1.8663,0.1703,3.5572,3.4096,0.9849,0.0067,0.001,0.3878,1.8147,0.0002,3.6216,0.1472,0.0077,0.0016,3.4759,2.2962,4.9495,2.1803,1.9548,0.0004,0.4795,3.1826,3.1661,1.1458,0.7058,2.6802,1.8621,0.0014,0.0088,0.5664,1.1752,5.4877,5.0706,2.2505,0.001,0.0029,1.791,0.8858,1.9516,3.6412,0.0092,0.0091,2.5647,0.9509,2.4393,2.3194,3.4425,0.011,1.3302,0.694,0.2537,6.7967,0.0096,0.0047,2.5311,2.9739,0.417,3.5664,0.8741,2.9192,0.0017,0.0061,4.8421,1.8339,2.5512,0.735,6.4825,0.0062,0.0005,3.8242,3.6302,3.1476,0.9055,2.7646,4.6951,1.8734,2.1379]}

{"id":4238,"ended":true,"length":317,"text":"The book opens with the statement that `` war no longer exists `` ; that is, war as `` battle in a field between men and machinery `` or `` a massive deciding event`` between two opposing forces, between individual men. Modern war has come to be an inter-temporal event `` an event of time `` where time, not geographical time, is the organizing factor ; it is an event of space where space, rather than the traditional conception of distance, is the determining factor. War is thus no longer a single- or single-day event. It is the product of a complex array and interdependence of factors. That means that the traditional concept of `` war `` is inappropriate for describing modern war. The book argues that war is now an event and concept of process rather than of space. Modern war is an `` event of time `` or a `` process of time ``. The book further argues that the traditional notion of war as `` a deciding event in which an army is the instrument `` is inapplicable both to modern war and to all time. That is, it is an anachronism. The book concludes that modern war, or `` postmodern war ``, as it is termed in the book, is a type of `` post-event `` : that is where `` the result is not determined by an event as in traditional models of war ``; where `` the event is neither the cause nor the product of the war; `` where `` there being no decisive event does not imply a lack of conflict or war ``. Rather, it implies an emergent and self-regulating nature of combat and war that leads to a continuous conflict and war.","token_len":338,"entropy":[7.4434,5.6632,0.2323,2.0171,5.5948,1.255,9.352,12.6944,7.1142,0.1241,3.0685,5.8945,7.6771,3.1137,2.4233,0.2483,2.212,5.0852,6.5973,8.2661,4.5648,3.1698,3.5861,5.881,4.5756,0.5346,5.3941,3.5514,4.5179,2.2725,2.7107,8.1954,13.8619,3.5736,8.9678,4.144,3.1812,4.4901,1.2611,2.2622,5.0163,5.7042,1.7468,3.5229,8.9955,1.8783,2.744,4.266,0.3808,1.9374,4.3694,4.1682,1.8743,5.9854,0.0097,3.3716,6.51,5.4559,0.8051,2.3417,4.1677,2.7326,4.5105,4.2581,3.4693,3.802,8.2445,3.022,0.1481,1.1089,1.6309,7.5419,1.913,6.9349,3.1198,0.5393,2.8483,0.5266,0.4865,4.6961,4.5297,1.7249,2.6106,4.0994,0.0228,2.9188,6.639,6.1569,0.092,8.1444,0.3507,0.6904,0.3966,2.6226,0.0708,0.5728,2.3528,1.2852,4.5318,3.9882,0.0525,1.1964,4.4902,3.2428,4.2483,4.2748,0.0292,5.9778,1.2556,1.623,1.4586,0.3938,3.2623,5.4045,0.0535,2.0064,3.7225,5.0476,7.0372,2.7963,4.4536,0.0148,0.1754,2.5835,1.634,5.1695,4.1109,0.6435,1.863,6.3387,3.5441,0.0573,4.7579,1.0392,3.3907,1.3745,9.8917,1.8305,4.4709,4.7467,0.5245,0.6888,1.8214,2.382,4.5501,0.3681,1.4553,0.9981,3.2537,2.4154,2.2858,4.6449,7.7413,1.2077,9.0516,4.1258,0.0082,2.8369,4.1004,0.8189,5.702,0.3302,0.9219,2.2796,7.9969,0.8382,0.5066,0.6246,0.2963,4.0937,1.4573,2.2386,6.2798,0.7521,1.1839,0.2972,2.9411,1.602,1.0368,4.9914,1.1711,0.0878,1.4998,2.7696,2.492,0.0258,1.4458,1.8201,2.5462,2.1019,10.1815,0.1485,2.9317,3.6733,4.4468,5.1516,1.8071,4.9948,6.6301,5.0711,1.262,4.8147,2.379,0.0626,0.006,8.1391,0.3305,2.4664,0.4624,0.1611,0.3034,4.8406,4.7224,0.7154,4.1456,0.6794,0.14,2.6571,0.5396,2.7122,7.6284,2.2664,0.0008,0.7354,2.0258,1.3267,0.6987,3.0183,1.6992,2.803,0.1403,3.176,4.2008,5.7914,6.6503,2.6237,0.223,2.6859,0.2349,4.3012,0.6565,0.5494,4.6595,1.9443,0.6921,1.1147,0.1389,0.5347,1.5966,5.9482,0.0518,4.6784,3.2705,2.1479,4.6703,2.1654,7.1194,2.9771,0.0642,12.4068,6.4497,2.986,5.7661,1.7506,2.5288,4.9871,0.4576,4.4161,2.1126,4.554,3.3788,4.2056,6.7274,0.786,0.9332,3.9732,4.4554,4.4819,3.8216,1.1168,2.3873,0.561,5.5879,3.154,3.9895,0.9114,0.3563,4.3267,0.0789,2.4717,4.401,4.6323,5.1815,2.9964,2.153,3.526,9.3748,0.4535,4.1726,2.4309,6.336,0.0426,2.5807,1.5695,6.3403,0.0221,4.514,2.1035,2.8206,3.556,3.2051,5.4356,0.2504,1.8467,2.79,2.4381,6.0493,0.0052,2.9269,5.8882,0.0324,4.16,0.1957,4.898,0.5512,6.1894,2.3267,2.2917,3.5827,4.7081,0.3183,1.365,4.9646,5.4141,2.0248,1.6726,1.9076]}
{"id":2101,"ended":true,"length":325,"text":"The city of Napa has historically not received as many wine country tourists as the cities north of it. A $ 300 million flood management project around the turn of the 21st century to lower the city by 5 feet was designed to reverse that trend. But the cost of the projects led to a lawsuit, and while the project has mostly been completed, visitors to the area still tend to avoid the area. A lot of the Napa Valley wineries are outside the city itself, and the city has a reputation for expensive restaurants, which people tend to flock to when they visit the region.\n\nOne way that Napa is trying to lure more tourists into its downtown is to use street furniture to increase the overall impression that it is the place to go. City officials and the Chamber of Commerce have set up street furniture as wine country tourists walk through the downtown on their way to a winery. Most of the structures are small tables and chairs, though there are a few larger structures for those who do not mind waiting in line or drinking while they wait. The large table and chairs in the photo below were put up just a few months ago in a section where there are a number of restaurants.\n\nI have to admit that the sight of people sitting outside enjoying meals while wine is flowing down the street does seem like a very Napa thing. I can see having table and chairs set up for an hour or two before or after lunch, although the lack of chairs that I could see on this street suggests that they are trying to get a lot of use out of them. Maybe the City of Napa will consider using similar structures on other streets that might otherwise go under-utilized.","token_len":340,"entropy":[6.9747,1.7491,7.6553,1.2657,2.5004,7.3054,5.2466,5.0814,3.3332,1.187,8.906,8.0404,2.3519,0.1832,2.2859,5.4874,6.8127,0.1888,2.5822,0.8908,4.5302,6.2373,13.2907,2.0993,7.4938,7.2937,1.0632,6.9676,0.9177,6.7382,0.0382,0.0068,4.8562,0.0086,0.0653,5.3742,6.3243,0.6147,2.638,6.4795,5.1058,2.986,3.4721,4.8592,0.4642,6.6693,1.0359,0.8434,0.5453,2.7862,1.8922,4.8325,0.858,1.4321,4.139,6.127,0.5242,1.431,6.1563,2.7418,1.3292,6.3468,1.4578,3.2669,1.7781,6.1636,0.7359,2.7544,0.2951,7.732,1.8267,1.7805,2.8559,3.0745,4.7901,0.0342,4.6917,1.3082,1.9021,0.8513,4.6639,5.1017,0.1399,1.5087,4.6704,0.0029,1.8136,7.8753,0.0261,1.8638,6.8036,1.6171,1.3395,6.1038,0.7141,1.3467,1.8732,2.2317,1.7256,2.4903,3.271,0.3137,6.896,4.4799,1.8773,2.3374,5.7728,2.846,0.0869,4.2409,0.0607,1.6739,0.588,4.4327,2.2247,3.003,0.2433,0.8712,0.0025,4.6809,4.2661,3.0199,0.6415,0.0091,2.7827,4.2465,0.0228,4.5079,2.1223,1.4129,2.857,1.8211,5.4616,0.7191,1.9824,4.3405,7.103,6.082,2.2215,4.4196,1.2872,5.0881,8.1952,1.6267,1.7363,0.8055,3.3958,1.5381,0.796,1.7229,0.5513,6.3534,0.7663,4.3921,2.5588,6.7658,0.0584,0.018,1.1666,5.2887,0.44,4.7843,1.8107,4.6504,10.4708,1.9293,6.2679,6.856,2.0207,0.7493,3.2328,4.7003,2.3913,0.3359,0.1618,2.5712,3.0838,0.0088,1.0094,5.4192,0.7771,0.4232,8.2424,0.9558,3.8761,5.9561,2.1186,1.1183,1.0124,4.3196,1.9795,0.2869,2.3942,0.5049,2.6379,4.0587,4.4496,2.9013,0.8173,5.1545,1.0392,3.844,5.3965,2.078,0.6441,3.6846,6.8583,4.18,1.6763,1.4787,0.7704,2.0757,5.2541,3.6669,2.5696,0.3015,3.9518,0.8076,6.1102,1.8331,3.0382,4.5147,0.5703,4.4273,2.311,0.315,1.9416,0.0991,3.4102,1.7817,6.1153,4.2723,3.4849,1.3268,3.2994,2.932,0.0035,3.561,1.5445,0.7431,0.0001,5.3026,3.145,2.6543,0.968,0.8717,2.3172,5.9883,0.1711,3.5084,2.6692,4.1066,3.5935,9.8611,3.2552,5.0873,3.0802,3.5886,3.5423,0.9968,0.9153,4.3953,3.0063,2.0413,0.4963,4.6977,10.8922,0.0081,2.2374,0.7852,2.5272,3.4423,2.6824,8.4676,7.011,2.354,0.1669,4.5937,0.1735,2.3375,5.2543,2.8252,1.253,1.0567,3.91,4.5731,0.1333,4.8992,1.8272,5.3852,2.5068,5.3572,0.0027,4.2745,5.3347,2.4907,4.8801,0.744,2.7003,3.5964,3.7645,4.4626,0.6161,3.3097,0.9517,4.7589,0.0992,2.2277,2.2964,4.5355,0.1116,6.2914,0.0828,0.0061,4.5045,0.2394,5.1847,2.2072,6.7424,1.2037,0.0158,0.0016,2.2858,3.088,2.8424,5.8144,3.851,2.6848,2.3272,1.8695,3.1791,5.0402,5.0191,4.9321,3.4466,3.3055,0.9097,0.0396,0.5394]}

The b-side was the song `` The Promise Land `` and was a duet with gospel trio The Shirelles. The single was released on RCA Victor in the U.S. Only a few thousand copies were sold due to the poor sales of the album.\n\nThe AllMusic review of the album states: `` The title track, featuring David Clayton-Thomas, is a beautiful and powerful song, but the other tunes are simply not as memorable. A few of the melodies don't work for the band, and it's the same thing over and over again.\n\nThis song is a duet between Clayton-Thomas and Delbert McClinton. David Clayton-Thomas was originally going to record it as a solo song. Delbert told David that he wanted to sing with him and they recorded this duet version together.\n\nAll lyrics of the lyrics are copyrighted by their respective authors, artists and labels.

{"id":3554,"ended":false,"length":302,"text":"Feral horses are born and live in the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of feral horses exist throughout the world. Studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the processes by which feral horses colonize new territories. Genetic studies into feral horse populations, including analysis of the relationship between feral horse genetic diversity and geographic distance, are important to the evaluation of their populations, and management of feral horses on public land. Feral horses on National Forest land often live within close proximity to non-feral horses. Feral horses and non-feral horses may interbreed to produce fertile hybrids and progeny. This means that the distribution of hybrids is an important factor in the evolution and future management of feral horses. Non-feral horses and feral horses in close proximity to each other may compete for vegetation resources, water, and grazing space. Feral horses may increase the availability of a resource by eliminating the use of that resource by non-feral horses. Feral and non-feral horses also both use roads which may result in more hybrid horses being born than would be expected if they did not use the roads. Feral horses are able to tolerate more road use than non-feral horses. Both feral and non-feral horses can be harmed by collisions where both use roads. Feral horses are likely to cause higher levels of damage than non-feral horses due to their larger size and the greater ability to inflict damage with their hooves and teeth. While non-feral horses are able to use vegetation patches for grazing, feral horses are typically able to eat only one species at a time and therefore must use grasses and forbs.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading","token_len":348,"entropy":[9.1845,7.1616,1.7361,5.9037,2.4793,4.1216,0.7979,1.5298,1.1224,1.2313,1.9776,3.3406,8.0198,0.0545,5.4838,0.0211,1.5438,0.994,4.2872,7.0604,0.5233,1.5457,0.2026,3.6252,2.7982,0.6022,0.9606,1.3448,7.7253,1.8749,1.3571,5.9175,1.8205,4.7659,4.6013,2.3611,0.2226,0.8923,6.6767,1.7379,0.0002,2.2052,0.7407,6.1449,0.0476,4.1819,2.0813,0.809,6.6191,1.1838,6.6447,1.793,3.1169,0.5162,3.4764,2.2414,6.699,0.0365,2.4332,6.4049,0.1501,2.5316,1.7996,3.815,1.5469,0.1177,4.5999,4.4983,0.5705,3.2476,2.7456,2.1416,3.0358,5.3045,0.1121,4.8476,4.4261,3.1717,1.4203,8.0844,0.9093,0.8015,0.8319,6.2351,4.1457,2.1251,1.1734,5.1768,0.0172,0.587,6.0079,6.9111,4.1337,0.7888,5.3338,2.6396,3.2212,4.3478,0.3621,0.0918,4.4868,0.6592,0.3175,0.0012,1.5494,1.4547,3.2709,0.0124,0.4031,4.7534,1.6626,0.0309,0.0356,0.0002,0.2508,3.5338,5.1917,0.0812,0.0,3.3666,1.9738,5.591,2.1292,2.6728,6.678,0.0022,1.2973,3.7532,4.9224,0.1108,2.1598,7.1637,0.2256,4.4766,2.3346,4.939,0.1715,1.7952,0.4092,1.5236,4.9401,2.6383,5.1289,2.3268,0.0146,0.3317,0.129,0.6869,5.7434,0.0317,0.0404,0.0003,0.2322,3.357,0.3404,0.0595,3.2212,6.8405,0.1033,1.1705,3.5721,0.0044,2.2509,5.8458,0.3483,9.8192,2.4353,1.701,5.9468,1.4292,0.7867,2.912,3.5019,0.744,2.6964,0.0177,0.256,1.6105,6.1553,1.0598,3.3998,0.0957,5.1499,3.6422,2.347,5.7585,1.8642,3.6883,0.0203,6.678,0.1059,1.2415,1.0237,0.0461,0.0141,0.0004,0.1128,0.4836,2.3415,0.0118,4.9149,0.4297,0.0232,0.0391,0.0002,0.3293,4.1949,7.7694,4.733,6.7106,5.5238,2.6934,4.0656,0.0045,3.8918,6.7664,4.1738,2.0651,1.9346,3.5239,4.3834,1.1548,1.1467,1.7784,1.8088,3.0899,0.0318,2.2225,1.4952,1.9858,0.3729,2.1869,0.0132,0.5456,1.9381,4.742,0.005,5.4162,3.5872,5.8804,1.8271,1.7055,0.2905,0.0053,0.0038,0.0002,0.0234,1.3934,5.3823,2.2732,0.6026,0.0638,0.0033,0.0108,0.0001,0.0865,2.9376,2.0524,7.0882,0.335,4.4197,5.7095,3.5967,4.0873,2.1796,0.6515,2.2154,0.0113,0.3821,1.5544,4.6788,0.0881,4.5296,5.2221,3.0557,0.0021,3.0546,2.3364,0.1493,0.0014,0.0024,0.0002,0.0174,3.0966,0.0071,2.2161,4.1398,1.4148,1.019,2.7755,2.9534,4.051,0.3607,7.3619,1.6902,3.9981,1.2474,4.6468,0.0452,2.7805,3.5827,0.1854,5.1155,2.7699,0.0021,0.0097,0.0003,0.1083,1.3713,3.1376,0.0033,3.1882,8.5445,8.1622,2.7397,2.0376,0.6408,2.5027,0.0858,0.9519,4.9764,2.4759,0.0206,5.8312,3.0343,4.0151,4.1897,3.1486,0.0461,0.0005,2.3059,4.3112,3.6576,2.9462,5.4721,1.6607,1.5377,6.7167,5.8178,2.2546,4.0439,0.0016,5.636,0.7565,0.0005,7.094,1.1454]}

He had recently signed three players, Milt Schmidt, Bobby Bauer and Woody Dumart, who all grew up together in Kitchener, Ontario, and had played together at the University of Wisconsin. On March 11 he signed a three-year, $75,000 contract, later raising it to $100,000 in time for the following season.\n\nIn his first year Ross guided the Indians to a 17\u201316\u20136 record and a sixth place finish in the league, one point out of the final playoff berth. During the year the Indians acquired Ed Walsh from the Buffalo Bisons, while on March 20 they traded Frank Brimsek to the St. Louis Browns for Bobby Wallace.\n\nPrior to the 1922 season Ross was fired by the Indians. He was not replaced by anyone for the 1922\u201323 season and the Indians struggled to an 8\u201322\u20131 finish and a fifth place finish that was far behind the league leaders Chicago White Sox (46\u201338) in both halves of the season. The last game of the season against the Boston Braves on September 10 was a sellout in Boston.\n\nWith a payroll of only $17,000 and a player payroll of $22,000 the Indians were in a very financially difficult situation. The team sold out the entire season for $1.50 a seat and attendance had been poor. In December 1923 the Indians moved to Cleveland and were renamed the Indians.\n\nThe Browns and Ross agreed to an settlement of $100,000, $50,000 of which was payable in cash immediately and the remainder was payable on the signing of free-agents in the off-season.\n\nReferences\n\nSources","token_len":348,"entropy":[8.0878,2.8236,6.6511,8.3512,2.7686,3.4979,2.0037,3.2506,6.1528,3.6895,4.6912,2.5183,1.6465,7.6061,5.9207,4.3941,0.8006,6.9363,7.8569,0.6387,10.1644,10.5019,5.1943,0.7683,1.6063,3.2499,6.8683,0.3899,4.0801,1.0982,8.6808,0.0171,0.733,3.099,1.2986,1.0484,2.2909,2.6691,1.7448,1.2769,1.7772,0.5902,0.0019,3.0862,1.1851,5.6075,3.312,3.2034,3.6881,2.4563,2.6708,2.0012,0.0274,0.0474,1.2521,0.0583,4.84,2.492,0.1085,0.4685,2.6227,8.7216,6.8629,2.374,0.2101,0.0968,1.9437,0.0754,0.0029,3.3752,7.3381,0.3228,0.8409,7.5582,0.8465,0.2285,0.8402,0.0006,3.1329,2.3008,0.9724,1.5594,11.9165,6.2943,0.6268,8.2278,0.1173,1.0168,4.9583,4.2442,3.3698,4.021,2.424,0.3973,1.2042,1.571,4.257,2.3664,0.2438,0.3568,0.0768,5.5637,2.4816,5.5406,2.2318,3.3005,0.1036,1.0924,2.8428,1.0332,2.2568,0.4176,5.1814,1.1635,3.9462,2.3134,0.7086,5.1593,7.173,7.358,1.3774,0.5375,5.1806,4.4727,0.0025,1.7165,4.3643,4.0108,5.3633,3.0823,2.5601,2.0358,6.439,7.2673,3.2505,5.1128,0.355,0.8216,0.2786,3.54,0.0571,0.0557,5.2415,0.6744,6.6287,8.729,0.6848,1.3883,0.0002,6.0523,0.0028,1.3601,9.5223,0.1403,1.551,1.9739,5.618,1.1242,0.3297,1.8242,2.0236,1.1991,1.5072,4.6845,3.5082,0.9487,4.4691,4.3396,1.187,5.4306,5.2344,0.4122,0.0619,3.0036,2.6729,1.4953,5.6939,1.0731,7.0076,1.9406,0.1518,5.1004,1.3185,2.8036,4.2032,3.458,2.3147,4.6118,0.063,0.0337,4.7377,4.0889,5.5323,2.8048,0.5158,2.7077,4.0138,6.8671,2.8503,0.0841,2.443,8.159,0.196,4.1128,1.8876,2.8293,4.8813,9.9041,0.3707,0.0557,0.5198,0.1483,2.3382,4.919,3.913,0.8566,0.2259,0.272,4.3439,0.4194,3.4736,3.2145,3.0762,3.9671,3.3629,1.5257,1.8664,5.5908,0.0813,3.2246,3.5322,1.3705,0.9029,0.0002,4.7185,3.103,5.4402,0.3379,3.9645,0.0809,4.3546,0.8949,1.2902,2.8555,1.1748,5.5039,4.6798,0.2895,0.742,4.1974,0.0626,0.8122,3.4503,0.3422,1.6844,2.7192,1.9231,3.8817,7.4373,2.8537,1.205,0.4159,1.9574,1.8957,6.1977,0.9779,1.6835,5.7334,1.2566,2.4501,1.4315,3.1388,0.7974,4.4753,3.3649,5.0937,1.8939,7.2797,3.4526,2.2209,6.9694,1.5132,2.7183,4.8386,4.0359,1.0619,0.5417,3.8824,0.6784,4.4576,1.295,3.4052,6.1857,0.1957,1.7509,0.9732,1.2261,0.0002,1.809,6.416,3.4944,6.2874,6.8278,0.2295,3.5261,10.0754,2.1278,1.5271,3.2264,0.1213,0.0089,3.1162,3.5989,2.1117,0.0782,0.0121,2.5197,0.3284,0.9457,6.1502,2.0191,2.6913,5.8382,3.4004,1.842,1.3255,2.257,2.8568,3.4612,1.7516,5.756,0.3261,5.7939,4.361,4.8104,3.3977,1.5148,5.6914,0.6843,0.0088,0.3012,2.0822,0.0002,9.6092,0.9657,0.0003,5.9263]}
{"id":4282,"ended":false,"length":308,"text":"Mouton broke off her contract with Audi in late 1985 to join Peugeot for the coming season. She contested the German Rally Championship and two WRC events in a Peugeot 205 Turbo 16, which she drove on the gravel. The first round of the championship was round one in Monte-Carlo, but it was marred by two incidents. Mouton rolled her car during the first stage of the opening rally and was forced to retire with gear box difficulties on the ninth stage of the second event at the Rallye du Maroc. She did finish one round of the championship in Argentina, but failed to score points due to an early retirement in both rallies.\n\nIn 1986 her only full-time activity was the French Rally Championship, driving a Lancia 037 and scoring a podium finish as well as points in four rounds. She then moved into touring cars and competed at a handful of rallies with Peugeot during 1986 and 1987.\n\nHer debut in World Rally Championship in the 1988 season was at Rally Australia in a Peugeot 205T16, but failed to score points. She would return to the WRC in the 1990 season where she made a full-season switch to Peugeot and joined the Women WRC team for a season. She also competed in support events including one round of the International Series, but was unable to record any points. She rejoined the Women's Rally team in the 1991 season. At the start of the season she was selected as the first female driver to compete in a WRC event, driving a Peugeot 205 Rallye.

{"id":4952,"ended":true,"length":324,"text":"Highway 403 begins at a junction with Highway 401 on the outskirts of Woodstock. The eastbound lanes split from eastbound Highway 401, whereas the westbound lanes merge into westbound Highway 401. It is one of the busiest urban interstates in Canada, with a daily average of 65,000 vehicles traveling along the route, and is a vital artery for commuters in southwestern Ontario, the largest region of Canada outside of the four Atlantic provinces.\n\nThe route runs northward through Dundalk, Ontario. Just after the North America border, Highway 403 continues north into Windsor. Along its northward course, the highway winds and curves along the waterfront of Thames River and makes a couple of sharp turns.\n\nHighway 403 is the second busiest highway in Ontario, passing through London and moving towards the North Bay as it winds through Georgian Bay. It then continues to the west out of North Bay to Highway 17. Most of the cities along Highway 403 are in the agricultural region, but there are many towns on the route and several large cities in areas surrounding both ends of the 403 southbound.\n\nThe Highway also has an important role connecting various tourist attractions in tourist regions of Ontario, such as Muskoka, Niagara, Bracebridge, Hearst Ontario and Ottawa.

{"id":992,"ended":true,"length":292,"text":"A tropical wave moved along the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) and passed through Cape Verde between August 30 and August 31. Although the Panair do Brasil headquarters in Recife, Brazil reported that the center of the system was forecast to pass through the southern coast of Brazil, the center actually entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 31, as shown by satellite-visible imagery.\n\nFigure 6. Satellite images showing the tropical wave in the west-central Atlantic on August 31. Credit: NOAA.\n\nThe system then entered the east-central Gulf of Mexico early September 1 and by early September 2, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Sixteen-E. Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bret and on September 3, the NHC upgraded the system to Hurricane Bret. The system moved toward the north and east at a speed of about 15 mph. On September 4, the NHC downgraded Bret back to a tropical storm as the circulation weakened because of interaction with land masses.\n\nAs of the last advisory available on September 5, Tropical Depression Bret was located approximately 65 miles south of Lafayette, Louisiana, or about 225 miles southwest of New Orleans and had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. The depression was located near the northern edge of a large dry air trough, allowing Bret to re-intensify. The next advisory on Bret is scheduled for 17:00 UTC.\n\nFor more information, visit http:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov, submit comments, or contact Nick Bellantoni, Coral Reef Watch Coordinator, at (410) 822-9650, nick.bellantoni@noaa.gov.","token_len":354,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,6.6992,4.2153,0.5014,10.706,1.4163,0.0035,0.7537,0.0301,0.586,1.2252,10.4842,4.472,0.3577,0.4155,2.8188,5.606,0.8348,6.7227,1.6707,0.0002,5.9716,3.7651,4.367,0.4373,2.4843,0.5516,1.0125,5.3332,1.2059,10.2693,9.6909,9.6215,4.1489,0.2612,11.6198,2.1165,8.9252,0.1016,1.8541,0.9429,4.8979,1.7647,1.3132,6.7732,1.1325,0.3521,6.237,0.8847,6.8398,0.1638,3.0117,1.3885,1.197,3.5282,3.7791,0.4094,1.5169,1.8695,1.2829,4.0293,7.5403,6.1363,0.5199,4.8089,0.1904,0.9154,1.6205,1.1472,1.2966,1.5928,4.206,4.6646,2.172,3.4476,5.2057,8.396,3.6386,0.75,1.2651,0.0097,3.0207,2.8852,0.6693,3.441,1.9961,3.0984,0.4968,3.7777,1.664,3.2116,0.9413,5.6449,3.2258,1.0458,4.4083,4.6588,0.3361,0.114,1.7665,2.8268,0.0069,2.8092,1.9832,0.3689,0.0002,1.3605,4.8912,5.3065,3.8933,0.3165,5.9916,0.4799,0.1119,3.2159,0.0795,0.0141,6.0598,3.9157,6.96,2.2713,6.9323,2.0186,1.1771,0.9773,1.3302,5.5627,3.7045,7.3222,0.8161,0.0139,1.4368,0.3793,0.0022,0.0504,8.1148,0.8273,0.7418,0.1157,4.7255,5.2231,11.7752,6.9702,3.2309,4.6218,3.7773,7.5844,1.245,1.594,0.1519,0.9535,10.908,6.3272,3.0516,2.0184,1.0199,11.2153,3.4972,4.9179,0.3555,1.6827,0.6996,1.0703,2.1243,0.0053,5.6162,0.4017,1.6717,0.4625,4.4577,5.0007,1.2746,1.8732,1.7725,3.8152,4.0966,0.4964,3.6935,2.3688,4.0501,4.8145,2.0621,1.7311,0.1798,1.7872,3.8969,1.1749,1.6122,3.2203,0.2673,0.7122,0.1144,0.603,0.9978,0.0018,7.3608,0.0404,5.4289,6.051,0.1067,2.1197,1.0181,0.7282,4.2443,2.2804,8.4209,4.2107,6.8874,0.3021,11.7504,0.2604,6.4224,3.4929,1.1407,1.0682,0.0002,4.3074,2.0214,3.5592,4.7809,7.8914,6.8954,1.6265,1.3783,1.5166,0.05,3.7553,2.8199,7.6538,1.3865,5.0266,3.5417,5.1692,0.1749,2.0401,0.2613,10.7778,0.3607,0.5179,1.2638,7.0904,1.6199,6.1471,0.0662,2.6642,0.0214,3.6935,0.121,3.4725,4.8022,4.866,0.4391,0.1133,0.1261,4.4578,0.3967,0.4812,1.4621,6.8459,1.6145,3.5289,3.2888,0.7913,3.8372,1.8738,0.0037,3.9431,3.5228,5.7987,7.0911,7.2205,1.784,6.4584,9.4456,0.1111,6.3196,0.8848,8.543,0.669,0.0045,2.3396,1.5415,5.6161,4.5962,2.9286,9.928,4.2186,1.5151,0.4245,8.768,0.9665,0.8357,2.6482,3.4495,0.5968,0.0002,5.0092,1.3732,0.2186,1.6116,1.3398,2.8899,0.0012,0.7363,0.0006,10.0173,3.0165,0.2161,7.9162,3.9624,0.0631,3.2614,0.0003,0.0102,0.0004,4.2857,7.3232,2.8257,1.2474,0.7867,1.9733,6.8857,6.0353,5.2859,3.4031,1.0809,8.8318,1.6906,5.8141,2.1488,0.4292,0.3364,1.8899,5.7789,0.0038,2.2774,3.8673,0.0171,5.9739,3.5963,1.1318,5.1724,0.6813,0.0155,0.0154,0.0041,0.041,7.5661,0.1536,0.0056,0.0144,0.9849]}

{"id":519,"ended":true,"length":319,"text":"On October 19, a low @ - @ pressure area moved into the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The area of disturbed weather quickly became well @ - @ organized, and was analyzed to become a tropical depression late on October 19. Although the initial intensity was only around 20 kt, it slowly intensified as it moved westward throughout the night of October 19 into October 20.\n\nAt 00Z (12Z) on October 20, the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, and later upgraded it to a hurricane. Hurricane # 9 ( HUG9 ) developed and strengthened due to an extremely favorable environment for further intensification. HUG9 also reached peak winds of 85 kt ( 145 mph ) that evening.\n\nHUG9 gradually weakened as its center passed to the northwest of Cuba on October 21 - 22. The hurricane crossed the Florida Straits on October 22 during the afternoon. On the east side of Florida, HUG9 quickly weakened as wind shear and dry air significantly slowed down its forward movement. The eye of the hurricane remained offshore of Florida and gradually faded shortly before 5 a.m. EDT on October 22. HUG9 rapidly degenerated to a tropical storm. At this time, wind shear and dry air increased, which helped to remove additional tropical moisture from the Hurricane. At 12 pm EDT on October 22, less than 10 hours after the previous peak of 85 kt, HUG9 turned toward the northeast and entered warmer temperatures and drier air. This transition resulted in HUG9 losing tropical characteristics. On October 24, the circulation was completely exposed to the wind and the storm was declared a post tropical cyclone. The remnant low moved into the southern Atlantic Ocean the next day.","token_len":354,"entropy":[7.7499,3.3793,0.2964,4.2481,8.2931,15.1355,9.3731,5.3424,9.6996,7.1885,7.3583,3.3594,0.8764,10.673,9.8294,1.8546,1.2851,2.2329,3.8627,3.499,10.4295,5.732,7.4478,3.2556,6.3141,8.2335,1.7048,2.1396,8.5607,3.1057,2.1242,3.8421,7.8299,3.0967,5.7763,1.18,4.558,2.8231,9.6408,3.2425,0.8913,1.8848,1.0254,6.2455,1.6221,4.7942,5.4291,1.6364,5.1959,4.2185,3.282,3.7298,1.002,1.2405,2.0934,4.5603,4.3076,2.7556,2.1372,2.6307,3.8529,0.4919,7.0762,0.3667,1.9147,4.0099,0.3286,0.7408,6.0713,3.1645,0.2648,0.3413,2.475,0.0698,3.5744,6.0023,8.4927,3.5727,3.6369,5.1017,1.4387,1.3067,0.2273,1.0767,0.1463,1.3749,6.4674,1.5353,0.0311,2.3059,6.6792,0.0135,0.128,6.5163,0.6746,9.4297,0.9072,0.7306,0.8077,2.3286,2.5709,1.9211,6.1548,3.3953,1.2578,0.1405,0.4209,2.3036,0.7438,4.7468,3.0278,6.4316,3.9085,6.7484,8.1253,8.6565,0.5602,6.2607,4.2552,2.1847,6.6563,0.0276,4.002,3.9916,5.264,5.2115,1.5152,6.6157,5.0579,0.0773,1.2211,4.8898,0.1785,0.152,3.6797,5.1192,6.4579,5.6955,0.7687,4.3896,1.1404,0.0855,2.9403,7.982,0.7337,1.4547,5.3036,4.6894,0.7823,1.2521,0.0003,3.7335,1.074,0.0819,6.3453,3.2024,2.9911,4.2489,4.618,4.2519,4.8248,0.7602,2.3076,1.6684,3.5936,2.7749,0.213,1.4669,7.2143,4.037,0.6647,1.6019,3.2518,6.507,0.6536,4.098,2.1732,0.0007,1.6089,0.377,0.9643,6.8939,1.5541,2.7569,1.9047,4.0477,2.5683,4.3309,1.0639,0.3481,3.6736,0.4672,2.609,0.0345,0.0079,5.8986,3.277,1.5423,7.533,4.3371,0.0374,2.6313,7.5757,2.743,8.0997,4.3474,2.769,1.3118,6.8367,1.0451,0.4123,2.029,9.2447,1.1491,0.8971,0.5827,4.9244,6.2574,3.0124,2.3237,2.7471,5.4249,6.2014,8.398,2.381,7.1627,3.1103,0.0008,0.0003,0.1459,4.3891,1.4845,0.2639,1.4078,0.259,3.8463,0.0385,0.0068,5.8094,8.0339,0.0071,1.6762,0.4271,1.0011,0.6074,2.3765,4.2675,2.8702,0.4957,0.3359,6.7853,0.8158,0.0045,1.4184,1.8469,0.0579,4.5235,3.2477,3.684,4.6679,2.0559,5.5552,5.7781,3.8134,3.3033,0.8336,0.2062,6.1395,2.0273,3.3167,4.1817,5.1475,0.7235,1.3929,0.0806,1.1463,0.1036,8.6202,0.1998,2.8822,2.4969,0.3107,0.8812,5.2229,4.9659,2.3646,6.0956,0.0626,0.0022,0.3942,1.453,0.034,0.005,4.4073,4.1535,0.4219,2.64,1.5926,5.1341,8.7977,5.0757,2.5338,4.2532,0.0048,1.2772,0.7165,3.8084,7.6177,3.5161,0.0146,5.0952,0.0605,0.0054,4.6175,6.8946,6.7042,2.2507,4.2735,0.6772,2.3607,0.176,1.4782,8.5905,2.5166,4.2687,7.0732,0.5136,1.0559,3.354,1.497,2.5725,2.5913,2.0771,5.1051,0.5333,8.5192,4.4571,2.8648,0.0125,0.3737,2.3738,7.6413,7.5728,11.1296,1.8276,0.4519,3.5013,2.2835,0.9531,6.7607,1.0485,0.3644,0.7024]}

Can you give me any concrete reason why this franchise should be banned or the music shut down? I can't imagine anyone under the age of 16 would listen to music from Guitar Hero or its licensed music. So, why is everyone out there so up in arms and calling for this sort of thing? All I know for sure is that I'm very happy with the direction this franchise is taking. It might not be to everyone's liking (as evident by the ratings on these games), but it sure as hell is to mine.","token_len":355,"entropy":[9.4969,0.2984,4.1442,5.8475,5.1376,4.1746,0.9531,3.0848,3.1195,13.5659,0.4266,12.7523,8.1237,1.78,4.687,3.9578,4.2044,2.9163,6.0807,1.9554,4.0087,0.9413,4.8516,3.3188,3.3339,2.6866,4.0391,2.1357,2.0003,0.2506,7.7587,3.6778,2.5819,0.2543,0.7249,0.2973,0.9275,0.1657,3.348,3.9364,0.6869,0.2446,0.6282,0.4193,4.0085,2.3824,0.0077,1.7079,0.3274,1.4256,0.3657,6.8517,1.7205,1.3981,1.3559,0.3455,1.5605,1.1802,2.8298,0.5359,3.61,7.3349,7.9756,2.7506,0.465,2.4761,0.2218,2.1267,0.7077,0.2726,1.6594,0.4214,1.9865,2.8807,3.0756,2.4467,0.9793,0.5026,0.0011,0.5407,0.0636,1.387,0.6062,0.0667,2.4177,0.7968,1.4597,0.002,2.3187,8.6906,6.9993,0.0002,1.5723,0.6139,0.7925,2.4575,0.1271,1.0944,0.1906,0.0127,2.8899,5.2582,1.8172,0.416,3.3484,0.0067,1.5989,1.3971,3.4562,0.0095,7.6081,7.5081,2.0581,0.9812,1.7696,1.9814,0.02,2.7701,1.3201,4.9544,0.2285,1.2711,2.3146,1.7619,0.0635,0.1366,0.183,0.8406,4.3051,4.0975,6.8874,2.0037,0.0042,4.5394,1.7307,3.4408,0.8204,0.4914,2.0474,2.0678,2.1702,2.9001,0.2663,0.6469,0.5014,2.7343,2.991,4.1858,1.5887,5.3888,0.2623,6.9241,8.1291,2.4086,1.658,0.0319,0.1096,4.8642,4.5097,0.094,3.6693,4.9355,2.3725,0.1163,2.3527,0.7745,0.8503,0.9613,1.8793,2.0712,4.2416,3.0541,1.1571,0.838,0.7639,2.001,0.7183,1.1917,6.0086,5.0027,3.2707,2.3171,2.0642,1.5755,2.3699,0.0739,0.6106,0.0051,3.7989,3.0435,4.5096,0.3623,3.5844,6.3178,1.2262,1.0704,0.4027,3.7104,1.5203,1.7825,3.2746,3.0853,0.1172,1.4854,0.6227,0.5314,0.6863,2.6026,6.2645,0.1139,0.002,1.4017,0.0249,2.4722,0.7387,0.2347,1.6872,0.6795,0.6447,1.9052,1.1279,1.3137,0.4058,0.6757,0.0003,6.8031,1.3038,6.186,0.0046,5.6351,5.0896,7.7552,9.5849,0.0011,0.269,3.3074,4.9121,1.8612,0.0139,3.4554,6.6985,5.6965,0.7208,1.4966,9.0961,2.3175,6.5246,0.4147,6.4243,0.5835,5.0458,2.3428,2.6132,4.8259,4.1924,1.3462,2.9924,6.6722,2.3182,0.7877,3.5802,2.663,5.3483,5.7509,9.7995,0.1048,1.4589,2.7292,2.6955,0.9992,3.7627,4.4828,7.3871,1.2155,0.3354,0.0048,3.2472,2.6815,5.0049,0.036,2.8277,2.2149,1.6834,0.0079,2.6609,4.4103,5.4391,2.1279,1.735,4.1284,0.8157,3.6168,2.2509,5.456,6.4569,0.4551,3.5867,5.8937,0.5264,0.0027,3.3214,4.7519,1.6699,2.0147,4.7893,0.0016,0.7634,1.0376,5.8178,1.4614,2.336,2.93,0.2646,0.0574,0.3104,3.667,1.8581,4.6848,3.3909,1.3819,1.2494,3.8286,2.106,2.2698,1.0671,2.4814,1.1307,2.9015,5.1336,1.7876,0.5537,6.0554,1.8526,0.0493,2.2533,4.0959,3.5774,9.6707,0.4925,0.7143,7.5256,3.145,4.3881,2.0421,0.7846,0.0819,1.4317,3.5766,3.5136,0.1385,1.5608,4.1234,2.7542,0.395]}

Hope that works for the poll.","token_len":355,"entropy":[5.5719,11.3516,10.2697,8.7102,3.6151,6.8319,0.352,6.0191,12.7922,11.0599,4.732,1.9027,3.8005,4.1189,3.0936,5.9331,1.0651,0.7845,0.6792,6.8644,4.2824,2.4319,7.5633,6.5716,8.2801,0.1794,2.3026,5.2366,1.1068,15.363,3.1553,1.5232,5.8493,2.3411,2.0627,2.3007,2.5836,4.8982,5.5892,1.2928,4.4234,2.7969,3.0942,4.0309,4.7867,1.157,3.5093,6.7655,1.3108,3.5135,3.3208,4.385,5.785,3.5058,3.571,7.5916,0.3571,4.5637,1.7335,1.8075,4.9413,1.5955,4.0688,1.8628,2.0279,4.1034,3.5968,3.6526,7.2517,4.9754,1.519,3.887,1.1103,6.8684,2.2125,0.0914,6.1205,3.8385,5.3707,4.2816,0.6441,7.7857,2.45,0.886,3.0566,0.9259,6.1065,2.2765,1.27,0.9568,0.7895,5.1823,6.1297,2.2884,3.2646,8.9817,4.7069,2.6684,2.5337,0.3265,2.8331,0.8413,3.9271,4.413,1.0915,0.02,3.6751,1.2075,4.6728,0.3583,3.155,0.6044,0.2574,3.6301,1.4518,2.9733,5.1517,5.026,5.946,1.0675,3.7084,2.2496,1.8874,2.3417,3.63,1.4839,2.6126,0.0314,2.6133,3.9026,4.67,1.8654,4.048,1.7963,3.9718,4.0623,3.5501,4.2338,6.0266,5.9205,3.8952,4.539,3.5384,3.7844,5.725,0.4342,6.147,4.909,3.7578,1.629,2.4805,0.2017,0.3946,1.3173,1.3405,0.0003,4.1111,0.9021,5.1333,1.4799,1.4245,2.3427,7.3192,0.0072,8.7859,2.1176,3.9372,1.4518,4.7803,5.1667,3.6955,3.8145,3.4767,3.2377,0.0018,6.0305,0.0003,3.2936,3.1526,6.0188,4.1724,2.7102,3.0537,0.0679,0.0042,1.9133,2.8837,1.6548,0.0146,0.0524,0.0092,0.2968,1.3412,3.7626,3.6303,0.5953,1.0885,2.8122,2.2,4.936,2.7808,2.0734,0.8577,4.0566,1.0506,6.8096,2.9498,3.0438,2.0657,9.1937,7.7164,1.2029,6.8066,0.176,3.9692,1.2691,2.3582,2.1736,1.2281,3.5642,1.3277,0.2049,2.0796,7.2238,5.719,0.3506,1.5637,2.7911,0.0003,4.4202,0.0541,2.2076,2.997,2.6979,4.4688,2.3669,4.4917,2.9363,5.9224,2.5274,3.8079,1.5348,1.5121,4.6846,2.0486,0.5909,6.5001,1.8799,2.6461,0.937,2.0068,2.3651,1.3257,0.4311,0.6776,1.0267,4.7088,4.851,3.2023,9.235,2.5168,0.9668,2.8379,2.4681,1.4726,1.925,0.5261,6.8161,3.345,0.5057,0.0132,2.1206,0.0089,0.0021,0.0873,3.5753,1.9713,5.1575,2.5286,0.3161,2.6953,7.3032,0.8757,4.0585,2.8345,2.8704,6.284,0.3188,1.7538,0.1105,5.0716,6.3832,6.51,1.2833,2.1824,1.9599,0.5557,0.5764,4.9755,3.1356,0.6896,3.6996,4.2487,0.4988,0.3671,0.9066,0.0002,4.976,0.9805,1.0433,3.0959,1.833,4.7323,0.9148,6.9737,4.8741,3.3601,1.445,3.7643,4.9929,0.0104,1.2658,0.5926,0.0108,0.8702,0.0178,0.004,0.7017,1.2602,4.2394,1.4319,4.7888,0.5079,3.7954,0.838,3.1484,2.3583,1.3985,1.751,1.8398,3.3085,1.4248,5.1104,2.0392,3.1004,1.6102,1.2713,7.6274,1.8242,6.403,1.132,2.6096,10.3478,0.7036]}

{"id":442,"ended":true,"length":297,"text":"The explosive charges in HMS Campbeltown detonated at noon on 28 March 1942, and the dry dock was destroyed. Reports vary on the fate of the two tankers that were in the dock, one of which was the US-flagged SS Northampton (IMO 9058699), laden with 4,080 tons of gasoline, and the other Soviet (IMO 90479974) (a Russian designation  for an \"US registered\" tanker). Some accounts suggest the Northampton sank, however, other sources report nothing at all sank and the Northampton escaped into the open sea. The USN initially reported that Campbeltown was \"sinking\", but this was only a misreport due to the effects of shock wave that had knocked out communication on the USS Bataan as she neared to assist. An estimated 1,500 people were on board at the time of the explosion, but a third of these were later rescued by the USS Yorktown and the USS Pueblo.\n\nAlthough Campbeltown was a British vessel and the USN did not have any jurisdiction over her, Vice Admiral Raymond Spruance decided to send the British destroyer HMS Agincourt to the site and to take command of the salvage effort. Agincourt attempted to recover bodies and debris from where Campbeltown had been but was prevented from doing so by Soviet gunfire. Agincourt also attempted to salvage the tanker Northampton, although this was to prove unsuccessful.\n\nThe Soviet submarine U-39 torpedoed Campbeltown on 29 March, but Captain Spiers succeeded in bringing her to safety.\n\nA film was made at the time of the explosion and the subsequent salvage operation by the U.S. Navy which was eventually released in 1947.","token_len":357,"entropy":[10.5239,5.7568,4.0592,13.1398,9.021,5.4993,0.0165,11.0703,2.5982,6.0752,1.0879,5.9087,2.6249,5.2423,1.0964,2.2617,1.8712,9.8045,1.6871,1.8532,3.3073,1.5835,7.6666,6.4745,1.2963,0.5311,3.9735,0.0115,0.52,4.4445,7.7993,1.0248,2.4012,1.534,4.3842,0.7658,1.2233,1.9141,4.9465,1.2914,0.3435,0.688,3.7555,6.2042,2.8982,5.1472,0.0495,4.1601,7.0262,4.3862,2.8538,8.5255,3.827,4.0852,4.7614,6.6401,7.9355,2.0179,11.1485,0.004,0.0423,5.1811,0.8348,7.5721,0.9379,0.2077,5.5902,1.5638,1.7731,0.6279,0.1455,8.1286,4.9162,0.1475,0.0049,4.7131,4.4687,4.1695,7.7019,1.7336,6.1449,5.7994,4.4989,5.8875,9.8537,9.4178,4.3435,3.4246,6.5788,8.8084,2.1078,2.3009,0.9887,5.1613,3.3111,1.8529,2.0701,4.7534,0.0684,3.6087,3.0108,5.7087,0.9613,5.8177,2.7972,3.0172,7.723,3.4349,0.0334,9.3614,2.7558,1.4818,2.4641,0.0357,5.7673,4.5752,0.4255,3.1282,0.7282,0.5678,1.8959,3.0602,4.6371,6.7119,1.8415,1.19,6.5752,0.001,0.0005,0.8577,3.7825,4.7498,2.6321,2.2749,0.6311,2.6568,1.175,4.658,2.6902,4.9888,5.5717,4.8726,0.0117,0.9137,8.2821,0.0453,7.7803,2.7164,4.9459,1.7041,5.1304,1.7207,5.6457,3.7673,0.8511,5.3108,5.3385,4.4125,0.0484,5.7397,2.7959,5.0947,0.0008,6.4849,7.2948,2.8223,5.1193,3.9832,2.6844,0.1006,1.9291,2.7596,0.8304,3.0489,0.7333,2.8225,0.3782,0.0191,0.7024,0.1553,2.3793,0.8927,2.5758,3.8986,5.6102,1.0795,3.6046,0.8125,4.6461,2.1393,1.1319,1.0871,3.2893,6.5138,0.2458,2.8018,1.6082,2.7235,4.9543,2.919,0.2702,0.87,1.7466,0.0497,5.1678,3.4277,0.0012,0.0009,0.791,3.3751,5.4718,3.5288,2.9711,2.4382,2.0352,0.3301,2.8071,0.2016,3.3949,1.6961,4.7751,0.1484,3.3521,0.475,9.5869,0.3705,6.582,6.9655,4.9443,0.9927,5.9591,0.485,2.808,1.8728,4.1957,3.7771,0.7213,5.9096,3.2414,0.0406,0.8419,2.128,4.1209,2.9834,3.1347,3.6928,4.3329,0.266,0.4821,5.8016,2.5221,0.4134,3.3578,1.2232,0.0,5.9911,0.0974,3.9527,7.3764,2.3214,3.8104,0.8471,7.2082,3.3013,0.0012,0.001,0.9306,0.9903,4.8076,0.9848,4.7068,1.1821,0.5181,0.0109,0.6748,6.3518,7.7669,0.4695,2.9646,0.418,0.0001,3.7381,2.1305,0.0674,2.6104,1.7557,5.6735,6.5897,0.1694,1.3868,4.295,2.2582,1.4861,6.0251,4.8994,2.9197,0.845,1.8703,0.0002,1.8191,4.2988,3.979,4.6734,1.662,5.4838,5.6058,0.6105,1.9771,0.0009,0.0012,1.4738,2.9068,0.4651,2.8462,2.706,5.0969,5.7112,14.3689,6.3223,0.0612,3.8717,1.8441,1.3505,1.9736,0.9515,3.4612,0.0002,3.3017,8.0218,3.3523,0.5941,3.8756,0.5922,1.2839,0.5293,0.1734,1.2623,2.2147,2.2588,6.0628,3.8849,2.1485,2.7766,0.8271,4.3979,3.3278,0.0844,0.1182,0.8501,3.9219,2.2988,5.091,6.3075,2.3674,4.5385,0.615]}
{"id":3318,"ended":false,"length":311,"text":"Runcorn has been used for the shooting of films and television programmes. Some of the sequences in the first two series of the BBC police drama Merseybeat were filmed in and around the town, and at the studios of Runcorn Studios.\n\nThe area was also home to the original Runcorn Studios, which were used by Path\u00e9 News for filming from 1925 up till 1950 when their studios in Manchester were reopened. Films made for Path\u00e9 News at the studios included King Kong, the first sound film ever made, and the first-ever documentary film, On Wings Of Eagles.\n\nRuncorn is also the UK's first town to have its own railway station, as the old station was located in Liverpool (then known as Runcorn) but had the word Liverpool and was a branch line as opposed to a station. The first train ran from Liverpool Lime Street on 12 March 1853, less than nine months after the Liverpool And Crewe Railway was constructed, and was provided by an express train (the \"Lime Street Special\"), which left Liverpool at 7.25am. The line remained open for the next thirty-five years with a freight section running to Northwich and then to Newton-le-Willows but in the 1860s it was closed by British Railways and not used for passenger services until the 1970s, when it served as a siding to the A5.\n\nDuring the Second World War Runcorn played host to thousands of children evacuated from Liverpool as the city was home to hundreds of factory production facilities.

The J\u00fc\u00fcrl\u00fc and Han J\u00fc\u00fcrl\u00fc share both cultural traits and linguistic affinities.\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, there were approximately 400,000 Chinese-born natives of North China who spoke the J\u00fc\u00fcrl\u00fc dialect of the Chinese Wu language and considered themselves to be Chinese.

Yancey was scuttled at Ulithi Atoll as part of the USS Yancey (ARL-15), and was later bombed by aircraft to destroy any potential evidence.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n  Online version (Archived)\n  Online version (Archived)\n  Online version (Archived)\n\nExternal links","token_len":360,"entropy":[8.901,2.7736,9.1557,0.3947,3.0755,7.9126,2.7897,1.2998,0.1488,6.5612,7.9668,0.0006,7.178,2.5996,2.098,5.5833,0.0014,4.1017,10.9381,6.3088,5.7345,1.2117,1.5359,5.5983,1.1477,3.4278,1.2953,4.4509,1.7372,0.0007,8.0691,3.1057,5.7115,17.409,2.2634,6.2789,11.6896,7.0309,8.5914,0.1755,2.0383,10.4431,0.0893,0.5165,6.6709,0.278,6.1431,2.689,2.5711,0.0048,0.0004,3.7128,1.0384,4.8416,0.8989,3.8755,1.9039,3.2018,5.2479,5.4307,0.0004,2.9716,2.1428,3.9316,0.0082,3.1725,5.9212,1.1985,2.5923,0.6902,0.8808,5.4918,3.6898,1.5166,2.4655,2.2331,0.7975,3.2836,1.005,2.6498,2.0434,0.0034,0.0006,3.423,10.1737,1.618,2.4404,3.6117,0.7992,3.2,1.8558,1.5063,2.7757,0.011,4.8758,7.2766,4.0053,2.3091,2.2162,1.3203,2.943,0.8757,0.7719,0.3375,0.0025,0.001,4.2649,5.7753,0.2497,1.7968,3.3066,0.3435,2.0829,0.8392,1.1595,7.3571,4.4519,2.1767,2.9473,8.3388,2.5653,0.872,4.5992,2.0503,2.8722,0.0002,1.1708,0.0067,0.001,1.9323,5.6723,3.9022,7.843,0.3561,4.5158,1.5873,8.5611,6.1817,1.1589,4.9723,3.8878,3.4817,1.5878,2.4442,4.7204,3.4118,3.2055,4.9172,1.3688,2.7594,3.9686,3.8201,3.4351,0.5663,2.8421,2.6883,1.561,5.212,2.8423,0.0093,0.0007,4.3452,0.9722,5.1103,0.9028,1.8691,4.7286,4.0769,0.8521,0.0041,2.7852,7.789,4.3105,1.0137,4.8759,1.9243,1.4131,0.0002,3.5668,3.3263,2.9707,3.7058,9.8181,10.7951,6.0059,4.0493,7.0544,3.6477,3.8205,0.8636,4.4579,1.9588,1.6263,0.0733,0.2469,0.3135,2.2294,1.926,7.4715,0.858,0.2719,1.3777,0.7755,0.0019,0.0009,2.1838,4.0331,1.5355,11.2193,0.8969,2.1814,1.0572,5.0334,7.8105,1.3577,0.0135,10.6108,2.2082,7.219,2.8089,1.4559,1.2681,5.1282,0.2319,4.3913,0.0031,4.245,2.2474,1.2998,6.0886,0.0045,0.5941,1.1004,1.7579,0.9043,8.0936,0.2063,0.0048,1.4289,4.9467,1.9112,1.2477,2.9454,7.7639,2.7785,2.1389,5.2652,0.3017,6.0086,1.9105,2.4211,2.0049,3.5905,2.7685,0.9996,4.9057,1.6086,4.9161,0.3861,1.0362,0.0006,1.5402,3.3249,4.5394,1.332,3.3299,3.1347,4.4124,4.7665,2.8242,4.5284,0.0319,0.7969,6.6123,0.0767,0.3985,8.2657,1.5389,0.8131,6.8133,0.8825,0.0115,2.3753,0.4301,3.6409,5.3333,1.892,0.008,0.0006,1.0039,7.5394,0.0046,0.0016,3.3779,8.2386,3.5611,1.9032,8.5404,0.3151,5.3582,1.0293,0.0009,0.6504,6.7835,4.4669,0.1226,0.0042,1.4015,1.1423,0.0517,0.0209,1.2523,2.5974,1.6428,1.8474,2.8919,6.3984,0.5717,4.9297,6.0797,3.1216,5.348,5.1631,4.3882,2.0693,0.807,0.0003,7.7245,0.7998,0.0007,3.2779,5.1615,11.9362,10.2859,4.6994,4.2039,7.929,0.1777,0.6616,1.2101,11.5378,2.9194,0.0604,0.0356,1.1627,0.0027,0.0071,0.5912,10.5486,0.9339,0.0036,0.0142,0.0383,0.001,0.0031,0.5785,0.0011,5.9434,0.5834]}
{"id":4723,"ended":true,"length":348,"text":"During the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, Stein was selected by the Seattle Mariners, who took him with their third pick in the draft. Stein stated he was `` glad `` to have been drafted by the Mariners, as they were owned by a local group and were based in Seattle, his hometown, while the other two expansion teams, Kansas City Royals (who drafted him first) and Montreal Expos (who picked him second) were owned by outside investors. The Seattle Mariners were the only team to keep him on their roster, placing him in center field for the 1976 and 1977 seasons. However, Stein struggled in his first two seasons due to a high batting average on balls in play (BABIP), which reflected poor defense.\n\nStein was sent to the minors to get work to correct those issues. In 1978 he returned to his previous form, hitting a.283 average with 32 steals while playing center field. Stein's final MLB game was August 1, 1979. He finished his MLB career batting.254 with 14 career home runs and 74 RBI in 557 MLB games.[2] His father was Jewish, with Russian and Polish ancestry.[2][3]\n\nAfter retiring from baseball, Stein managed the West Seattle baseball association, and he also became a commercial real estate broker where he sold several major companies' office buildings in Seattle.\n\nIn his free time, he was a member of the West Seattle Jewish Community Center.[4] He was also active on a local baseball association and served on the board of directors for West Seattle Junior Baseball. Later on he coached West Seattle High School to a CIF State Championship and also volunteered with Seattle Jewish Community Center.\n\nHe was also a baseball coach at Seattle University and the University of Seattle and the University of British Columbia.","token_len":360,"entropy":[1.9437,7.9961,8.8524,0.0462,0.4147,7.0603,1.6895,0.1491,8.1829,2.5906,2.5396,1.188,0.4136,4.1862,0.0257,2.8181,1.2233,4.783,0.6068,1.3378,3.4453,2.653,0.9642,0.7549,0.3121,2.8056,0.5772,2.5104,8.0284,2.2762,1.518,10.0289,13.2521,7.1004,0.7758,1.6125,1.232,1.841,1.5841,0.5774,0.8001,1.9799,3.5374,2.9451,1.9887,8.5581,0.1553,3.1074,5.098,4.1532,2.8355,3.0034,6.491,0.3427,1.3309,2.1108,7.8573,1.0633,2.6643,5.6274,2.5631,2.7549,2.2669,8.5108,0.2556,2.9094,5.0195,0.0191,5.0895,4.0261,3.6775,3.3039,0.626,4.1606,0.8734,0.0148,5.0669,0.7213,0.0024,0.4057,0.5056,3.6118,0.065,0.5818,1.98,1.2057,2.1221,0.0851,6.8683,2.582,1.4232,2.4886,3.2572,0.2442,2.1261,2.3276,1.1319,0.8101,1.209,6.1077,1.6333,2.788,1.3199,1.2687,1.9545,8.0697,0.1965,1.2055,6.9395,0.1466,1.7216,0.82,3.8115,3.9973,0.5782,0.5941,0.7908,4.4789,0.0532,2.8184,7.1283,2.1799,1.1969,1.1066,1.9092,0.7309,4.5831,0.0157,2.0131,4.7895,2.843,0.0532,5.8182,0.9032,0.2784,0.0112,2.2896,7.5997,0.0082,2.1197,2.1722,8.4533,3.7848,3.7772,1.355,3.9118,0.0654,1.7045,0.0001,1.9414,4.2669,0.2224,1.1729,5.2156,2.9412,5.4102,5.4465,5.1753,5.9527,5.0155,0.9781,0.7117,2.2597,3.3259,1.6253,5.0012,0.2573,3.0533,5.256,2.6017,1.3593,2.7928,3.6706,10.0788,14.0101,2.0232,1.0347,4.9701,4.8576,4.0823,2.2615,4.7691,0.1534,1.3457,3.3754,2.4069,4.9357,6.9459,4.4025,0.9729,6.1907,4.0147,0.224,0.6181,2.7879,1.722,3.6401,2.0178,4.3523,0.1729,4.0985,9.2442,7.9674,1.2464,4.3795,6.7776,0.7743,0.0128,1.0489,4.6936,0.2152,2.1487,4.849,4.7561,6.3436,0.1502,7.3459,3.0164,0.0839,3.8949,7.2981,2.2805,7.0329,1.1564,4.3756,9.1562,2.7369,2.75,1.2593,0.972,3.1024,2.572,0.359,0.1862,0.6965,0.0002,3.8108,3.0394,0.7189,0.7286,0.9359,0.144,7.2698,2.7688,6.8525,4.6987,5.1158,6.9726,1.9239,3.1848,3.8862,4.1861,3.3332,1.0023,6.8544,3.5137,0.0318,2.3521,6.7674,0.0742,2.0099,4.1175,6.4764,4.7617,6.3676,6.3344,1.2113,2.4414,1.3403,1.1225,2.4556,0.0002,2.4339,3.6938,4.9279,0.047,0.5985,2.3639,2.1973,1.5487,2.066,0.0176,0.4558,5.4715,0.0392,4.3691,1.6227,1.7736,4.3464,0.3199,0.126,1.8247,1.3413,1.5731,3.0738,2.4988,3.0865,3.1661,5.5094,6.7764,3.0306,5.3449,1.7786,0.5151,1.5628,0.0431,1.1765,1.8298,5.1832,0.074,6.3972,1.9579,1.5364,6.2743,2.7389,1.976,6.0952,5.9315,0.023,1.5548,0.1851,5.1476,0.9961,6.8858,6.538,7.2737,0.5921,2.4153,3.324,5.235,2.4934,5.1818,4.5377,1.551,0.5462,1.3874,1.0355,0.0002,3.5578,1.0354,2.1989,1.108,5.2572,2.4659,1.7683,3.0305,4.1922,2.207,2.8572,1.4194,0.0476,2.7464,3.8327,3.3732,1.3628,0.0128,6.4623,0.0006,0.7257]}
{"id":4708,"ended":true,"length":330,"text":"Although combat in the game follows a strictly turn @ - @ based formula, the turn sequence of the characters you have are calculated based on the speed statistic of the character, and the speed stat on the character is itself calculated based on the character's health and fatigue stats, and the characters strength, will, agility, and willpower stats. It's pretty easy once you start experimenting with the combat formula, but i can give you a reference.\n\ni can not help you with the rest, however, if you'd like, i could try make a guide that will answer all your questions on the turn-at formula, etc.\n\n(this only works on old version 0.7.1 btw, but the formula will be the same on 1.x )\n\nSo to all those who have trouble making the combat work - there is a good answer to this. Basically you just need to adjust the formula.\n\n1) Make your characters health much lower 2) Have your characters will very low, and use that will\/agility to fight 3) Start your battles with very low will\/agility and use that endurance to fight or use willpower if you have it. Then work your way slowly up and when you can you can have strength and willpower and still have your endurance high. 4) Your strength is what determines what power attack you get. When their strength is high enough you can use power attacks. Keep boosting their strength and their endurance as high as possible while keeping your will and will\/agility low and you should be able to battle all game.\n\nYou can also lower combat to speed and use the agility to win a battle.

The 10th Battalion, south of the plateau, was to capture a Turkish outpost on Pashalaya Ridge. On 23 November, a Turkish platoon had attacked the outpost, but were defeated by 4 companies of the 10th Battalion. The 11th Battalion, having been delayed by the weather, now did not expect to be able to join the battle until 25 November.\n\nThe 1st Division began to advance, and, in the early hours of 25 November, the Australian 2\/7 and 2\/28th Mounted Rifles were ordered to capture two hills to the north of the town. One was held by the 4th Battalion, and the other was a Turkish outpost. They attacked at dawn, and after a brief skirmish at the captured position, a Turkish retreat began. By nightfall the Australians had reached the river, but were ordered to hold their positions.\n\nOn 26 November, in the afternoon, a British squadron of mounted cavalry crossed the river and began to advance on Kut. From then on the Australians and Turks were engaged in a bitter and long-drawn-out and indecisive battle. By nightfall on the 27th, Australian reinforcements had reached the town where they reported. They were sent forward along the south bank of the river, which had been turned into a river landing. The Australians took up positions at dusk, and after more fighting on the 28th, the position of the Australians and Turks was unchanged. In the morning of the 29th, as the Turkish defenders were withdrawing on the south bank, the Australians captured the town after a fierce battle. The Turks had been defeated. Kut fell and the British were in control of Alexandria.","token_len":361,"entropy":[2.6972,7.5904,7.6196,3.5886,3.8254,4.2725,2.6728,0.2863,1.5126,8.7005,1.0374,2.5731,2.4387,4.0802,0.0019,2.3079,8.3937,0.899,8.4339,8.0315,1.9977,1.6066,2.0234,5.1433,0.0375,0.8311,1.8373,7.4496,0.2661,0.7111,1.2025,0.1507,0.8955,2.5768,7.3442,2.8318,7.6566,2.9675,2.3685,6.5135,3.2652,6.9877,4.7891,5.7333,1.0514,3.4833,5.3215,3.1596,0.7946,3.3819,1.7651,5.5335,3.1784,3.4356,0.7833,2.973,1.6166,1.6514,4.39,3.6944,1.2754,5.6768,6.4201,0.3082,1.5669,1.4903,0.0109,0.2282,0.5821,1.3465,3.1373,0.0079,0.1879,1.5738,5.61,2.2258,6.6113,1.1574,1.5367,5.2122,0.4798,5.4844,6.9671,0.6514,5.2473,1.0061,1.4386,1.1832,0.0019,5.589,0.6547,2.3126,2.0053,4.42,0.3487,0.363,1.5488,0.0092,1.5876,4.5164,0.0124,3.9245,4.8441,2.1926,2.1602,3.3935,2.1783,4.4672,2.7751,1.5108,3.3407,0.9636,0.0413,1.912,0.0389,0.0499,1.7856,10.5377,4.4362,8.6256,4.2105,4.853,2.2836,0.1471,5.1804,2.0651,9.3606,0.1124,5.6094,0.0049,2.304,3.1254,0.2801,5.4118,4.0559,5.8585,4.0447,0.1328,1.6566,0.4663,0.5068,5.0564,1.3602,4.3002,2.3741,4.5325,0.329,0.916,3.6268,0.0963,1.2035,0.892,1.6796,0.4911,0.3369,1.0929,5.3964,5.8392,1.1758,1.4138,4.505,4.3369,3.4049,2.8809,1.132,1.3304,4.1389,1.6313,3.2227,1.8323,0.0039,3.8024,2.0556,9.5403,4.4048,0.3633,3.9238,1.4472,7.4122,3.9303,0.454,3.7858,2.7902,0.0628,2.0255,5.0486,1.0044,3.0351,0.5936,7.2238,2.1491,2.2036,1.2984,5.0822,0.1896,5.312,3.5824,2.2343,2.0895,1.9557,0.0001,1.8821,2.2759,0.0413,0.35,5.2345,0.9931,3.9227,0.8372,2.6692,3.9399,5.3501,1.8465,8.3165,3.8185,4.9781,0.4242,3.1778,1.6943,2.8231,1.1893,1.3991,2.2387,8.1329,4.1522,4.8491,5.9106,0.1779,1.1427,3.1561,3.7173,4.737,1.3798,3.2339,0.3514,1.0974,4.0541,3.242,4.5705,1.4102,3.1375,4.0448,0.0546,5.6307,6.1608,0.0036,0.7991,0.7795,3.785,1.9103,0.0201,5.1453,1.6171,3.1206,0.0184,0.9855,3.9456,4.6134,1.4021,2.0599,0.5722,2.0928,6.0596,2.1031,6.8562,7.6177,3.3427,1.125,4.8313,5.3334,5.8297,0.6114,5.5758,0.4362,0.4025,0.2012,0.8583,1.1518,3.6784,2.3467,0.5009,5.2502,0.5392,0.2699,3.5146,8.0151,2.3937,1.3392,2.3667,4.8217,3.0312,0.5387,2.0785,7.6888,0.7935,1.1408,3.7282,5.7131,4.2506,4.0828,0.2994,3.3299,0.0032,0.575,1.5676,7.2404,2.5478,0.3036,4.2745,2.6402,0.2333,0.5597,10.2356,0.286,3.9366,0.655,1.5307,2.1414,1.5204,0.5093,0.0018,0.4561,4.2561,0.6253,4.7621,5.6274,1.6285,4.9719,3.4132,0.7091,2.4682,0.1377,0.9576,0.7936,1.861,4.6763,1.2483,1.2366,6.2268,1.4337,2.6744,1.3096,0.9974,1.5882,3.8188,2.3721,2.365,3.5792,3.5878,8.8501,3.5021,4.3961,0.5911,2.8024,2.8357,4.8736,3.2367,0.3106,10.2809,0.6462]}

The School is preparing for this process of specialization and professionalization by the private sector.","token_len":362,"entropy":[2.9505,4.7193,9.3753,3.5219,9.128,0.0044,3.7915,6.5793,4.1818,1.5172,6.9369,5.2897,8.1626,8.137,3.1273,10.0803,5.9947,7.6689,3.3576,0.909,2.473,0.0578,3.5155,2.504,1.8511,4.8336,0.0635,0.9764,5.2907,1.1873,2.8934,2.993,0.1103,12.4733,10.3292,1.1427,2.6643,5.1559,5.3147,2.1495,2.6276,3.2056,6.8847,4.1903,1.9028,0.0023,2.3864,2.9816,0.7091,9.0148,0.0233,1.0128,5.8817,0.0463,6.7831,7.3993,1.9006,5.5958,3.1409,2.5487,10.0392,1.5373,5.1965,0.5872,1.926,5.5261,3.056,4.3268,4.5548,7.8069,0.5385,5.0981,1.0453,4.8163,3.6161,3.3272,6.5457,1.3663,7.5495,0.0429,5.8152,2.3934,4.5258,1.3211,7.9501,0.9676,1.283,0.0003,2.0802,4.2993,2.7931,5.1736,3.4458,7.8805,9.1699,0.2574,0.9253,1.1136,1.8306,1.3445,6.8686,2.4382,0.1993,0.204,3.4135,3.1482,0.0144,0.8105,1.6475,6.7669,0.0864,0.6488,0.0015,0.0002,1.7378,2.5634,3.4062,1.8199,3.3747,7.7094,0.6609,2.8056,0.2635,4.9343,1.2966,3.4266,0.3084,0.8102,0.0002,1.8368,4.1589,3.3414,2.8578,1.592,6.8853,0.3035,1.9052,2.7926,4.161,0.2994,0.0053,5.134,2.9107,8.16,4.222,0.9256,6.0975,0.0677,6.1336,0.4987,2.3856,8.3243,5.625,1.2868,2.7119,0.0132,5.005,4.1435,1.7516,8.1897,0.4534,5.1683,1.9315,5.8077,0.9586,0.6642,0.9002,3.722,3.3383,4.3135,0.1034,1.7961,0.3569,4.4917,1.3781,0.0628,0.658,1.8431,12.8035,0.3678,0.0074,6.304,1.5435,0.3367,0.0003,2.0045,5.8118,3.4637,1.2726,0.9485,0.0283,0.0029,1.614,3.8038,5.8354,2.3031,0.0112,0.8506,5.039,1.7848,0.9351,1.7617,1.9372,10.6678,2.7049,3.1215,6.4473,2.7507,3.0898,0.3078,1.521,2.9783,2.4161,2.0687,2.5346,0.2293,0.0068,2.3977,3.5376,0.1295,5.4578,1.6139,4.098,7.0649,0.8809,0.7187,0.0002,4.0263,1.442,0.7622,0.8304,0.6742,3.8929,3.3966,4.4892,4.3468,0.3854,5.0068,3.1044,0.6981,3.8491,2.5424,3.1902,0.0171,4.3306,6.6725,1.8887,1.3947,6.7358,3.5398,1.6654,3.1965,6.7506,0.783,4.4194,0.5295,0.7099,4.1649,0.6535,5.8432,0.4189,0.7509,5.9313,1.2671,0.572,0.0002,4.0104,8.0903,2.1323,2.8517,4.4504,0.0078,0.3693,5.0617,6.3269,0.5621,0.5504,7.8863,1.7574,1.2043,2.4012,4.3966,8.4038,0.2495,9.5405,1.4922,5.4976,0.7265,0.9392,3.3856,5.2803,0.031,3.19,0.8032,6.3226,3.981,4.2264,6.273,3.1092,3.7974,5.223,2.3313,7.187,1.8885,2.3798,2.1261,2.6825,1.1215,0.2837,0.2844,0.0002,1.5474,2.7245,3.4502,1.3217,1.1377,6.939,6.7519,0.2627,3.1911,6.5769,0.1984,2.3678,3.5995,0.0671,1.1645,1.6761,0.7071,0.0128,2.1771,6.727,0.0509,1.7475,2.1883,3.4273,3.7607,7.5951,5.1719,5.0154,0.9693,6.2611,4.7634,1.0929,1.2526,2.9627,2.7879,2.1231,6.1402,1.6259,3.283,3.5875,3.3778,5.0374,1.6475,5.9693,0.9681,1.8028,2.9536,5.2593,0.106,0.9979]}

With this in mind, we can see that at the time both < function > and < formula > are being expanded, the derivatives of < function > and < formula > are < function > and < formula > respectively.","token_len":362,"entropy":[5.4465,9.4729,1.3911,3.6534,2.0016,8.1596,13.0692,1.0991,9.5797,3.4968,1.444,3.5514,0.9456,6.9854,5.1722,2.1906,2.2051,2.0271,3.7989,1.0026,8.6377,12.6341,5.7601,2.749,0.7809,7.3613,0.83,1.7198,2.8214,2.6774,0.096,2.9956,10.1853,9.3694,2.2701,2.7719,2.5367,6.4282,0.7883,0.7961,3.4552,1.6653,4.831,3.3005,1.5823,5.4362,0.9199,0.7197,0.4769,3.7039,0.2192,1.688,2.4808,3.4107,0.3304,5.0644,1.6862,0.583,5.6776,0.4813,4.4366,0.5484,0.1752,2.0989,5.3498,0.8735,3.775,3.782,2.7323,0.5792,0.1388,0.2421,8.2855,2.6665,0.0215,2.7282,2.183,0.0515,4.0229,0.5672,2.6346,0.395,0.9352,0.089,0.1139,2.6361,6.1782,1.85,3.7436,0.3714,0.903,0.4207,0.0773,6.4748,0.6584,4.434,3.2356,0.0003,4.2685,3.8308,0.0068,0.2216,1.3519,2.3178,2.4159,0.1829,0.0559,1.4888,1.9773,2.3468,0.0997,1.2293,6.3797,1.255,2.546,0.7067,2.7118,1.2614,0.4203,6.6123,8.8788,6.9195,5.276,3.1456,5.3099,4.8047,5.5777,2.4218,2.3041,2.6023,4.4732,0.542,6.8115,6.2707,2.0133,5.971,0.0761,0.1904,0.1511,10.4493,4.911,2.7666,5.6126,0.502,5.6522,0.5096,0.1765,3.1112,0.5118,2.4421,5.361,1.2542,6.6174,5.3077,6.2901,0.634,1.2401,1.7395,3.1148,0.7325,0.2166,0.0157,0.012,1.1507,3.4844,6.88,3.2944,0.9607,5.2431,2.7363,1.6854,1.8944,0.3675,4.7262,0.7695,1.5964,0.6974,2.8575,5.3524,3.9621,0.8934,0.0379,0.0116,3.1115,0.3358,0.0686,0.1187,0.6209,1.2076,0.6066,0.0002,2.8786,3.5728,1.5071,1.3047,3.526,1.0028,4.3058,3.6297,3.8012,0.5867,6.4179,4.737,0.5989,7.4599,4.1478,8.2671,1.1355,5.8817,0.1064,0.046,0.1276,1.1114,0.0842,0.5239,6.0834,1.1929,1.9995,6.0004,1.2272,0.527,0.149,4.3476,2.5545,0.264,3.9234,1.4615,6.142,0.2467,0.662,1.4314,0.0207,0.4523,0.1913,0.0115,0.0217,1.1923,5.3728,0.199,1.7034,1.0179,1.574,1.0498,0.7522,0.5036,1.8989,2.1375,0.6229,2.2273,0.2715,3.2571,0.3847,0.4457,2.314,0.0123,2.2415,0.6024,0.0089,0.0209,0.3909,0.8146,0.0001,5.1951,4.4954,4.3478,6.3734,0.0144,8.1464,0.8118,1.9009,3.4006,3.3118,0.1035,1.4249,0.0002,7.2539,1.8303,0.0001,4.3667,0.1059,0.833,1.9951,0.0004,0.0191,0.0513,0.0091,0.1978,0.5785,0.0125,0.0927,0.0004,0.2968,0.1063,0.0002,5.6472,0.8722,4.6185,2.3067,2.0437,0.9872,2.2423,0.0066,4.0582,0.0714,0.013,0.0044,0.5233,6.1106,0.2622,0.3755,4.0532,1.7676,0.7876,2.3081,0.1325,4.0281,0.244,5.6501,1.2687,2.4811,0.034,0.1341,0.6973,0.8782,4.1786,0.4699,5.1717,0.6017,0.2619,6.9774,0.2226,0.5442,0.0096,0.0123,0.0091,0.0079,0.0023,0.2646,0.8514,0.1398,0.3469,1.1651,4.168,0.7716,0.4312,0.2462,0.0035,0.6856,0.0022,0.0073,0.0032,0.3779,6.9001,3.3372,0.0953,0.782,0.1353,0.0769,0.0088,3.2637,0.1909]}

That's what these songs do.``The only catch,\" he said, \"is that these songs that we had written in previous projects were a little longer than what we needed to use for our cartoon. But we just reassembled them as a song, we just added some extra lyrics and a chorale that we used in the episode. Then Dan [Fankhouser] did the music.\"But there was still one more minor annoyance. The writers had hoped to use \"Boop the Snorkel\" by British musician and composer Richard X for the introduction and end of the episode. But he declined the rights, as did the cartoon's production company, L.A.K.E.

If people don`t like it, it doesn`t matter.` Phil got out from behind his desk and started teaching me how to draw and make sketches. At the time, my skill level and understanding of art was really awful, but Phil kept coming back to the drawing board. ``\n\n``In our first meeting, Phil asked me where I wanted it to place in the store. I remember not responding correctly. Phil then pulled out his laptop and started to explain to me the architecture of the game. He showed me that the first screen was where I could see an image of the game that would help me know what to expect, which would guide my eye. That meeting allowed me to understand what we were doing, where we were headed, and what it would take to get there, all in one session. ``\n\nChen, who was in charge of Flower, took a totally different approach. ``We went into the meeting as two designers with no experience designing an interactive game,`` he says. ``Phil taught us almost everything, including how to handle the creative and artistic aspects of the game. We discussed how users would use the game, and what the game would do to help them. We had to make sure that our game would be appealing and fun. We didn`t want to just copy other games. We were able to come up with our own ideas. ``","token_len":363,"entropy":[6.6723,5.7233,2.2322,12.1595,2.5423,2.89,13.3959,5.1058,10.7608,8.9308,5.6288,1.4332,12.8978,11.3527,1.4892,8.4561,2.103,9.8064,1.835,2.4083,7.233,4.1134,1.6012,4.7488,2.3092,2.4633,6.1291,0.7643,4.2837,2.4483,0.1882,0.8675,1.6672,1.2654,2.3802,12.8432,10.4243,2.2855,0.8457,0.6224,4.7158,0.1885,0.3799,4.7049,0.0003,5.6005,3.2383,0.2411,2.7967,5.3467,2.1755,4.0197,0.4748,0.9366,2.7446,2.5522,5.2499,1.5729,10.2466,0.7653,3.1755,2.828,2.7085,2.8399,4.0674,6.1988,1.736,7.7069,1.8069,3.6897,0.6223,0.8807,0.5092,3.8634,2.2177,4.2882,2.7164,0.1636,0.3467,1.7229,3.325,5.2584,2.1865,8.823,0.0002,0.4088,0.7366,0.1705,3.6707,3.4079,0.0317,0.0002,0.7119,1.4857,5.7181,8.5894,5.3762,4.3819,4.8029,2.1593,2.7741,0.3067,0.541,2.2142,5.9661,2.0101,0.9487,0.0328,4.4463,1.7704,3.1169,6.6417,1.2158,4.9391,1.1091,1.5604,0.3308,4.3304,7.7423,1.3675,4.6289,3.8549,0.2886,3.0479,1.5129,4.1464,8.3956,1.319,1.6022,5.1583,4.3757,3.2092,0.6237,1.1067,3.5328,2.3272,2.6786,1.8754,4.479,3.7203,0.082,2.9744,4.3253,4.0831,0.9483,1.3084,0.4469,3.178,2.59,0.7788,5.0047,0.5997,1.9647,6.0981,0.3039,8.9625,2.9772,0.6085,8.1087,0.6696,0.5747,5.2081,5.9486,7.9772,6.051,1.1189,3.3012,4.3583,5.6291,0.6931,2.1721,4.6877,0.5103,1.7188,2.5009,4.3995,2.1908,0.1314,2.2872,6.7916,0.4824,0.6544,1.0314,0.5733,1.8207,3.8089,0.1019,3.2609,1.6575,4.2766,5.6667,1.425,6.4368,2.5609,2.6821,2.4252,4.9355,2.2472,0.8514,1.1142,1.7024,4.6187,3.2262,4.4898,0.749,6.404,1.1797,1.799,3.4247,2.8419,3.3508,2.8698,5.8477,2.5464,6.2057,2.3435,4.2675,8.7737,6.0326,0.1746,0.0421,3.0937,1.4682,3.9477,0.6235,1.216,1.5318,4.2878,0.5783,0.359,3.7532,0.5759,0.4946,1.1647,3.6291,1.4425,0.4963,0.2933,2.1678,0.865,2.6636,4.437,1.9274,0.8412,4.0969,0.3373,1.4782,0.4066,0.0002,2.6303,0.0903,3.2988,1.3281,1.4812,3.3898,1.593,0.0305,4.1607,0.5842,5.0436,1.8833,9.9852,0.1697,0.1594,1.3886,1.7793,2.8305,3.8791,2.9478,0.9533,4.8337,4.338,3.9537,5.6837,3.3209,2.4095,1.756,5.0064,5.2039,2.9187,0.7307,1.6286,7.8368,0.5671,0.5108,0.1727,0.0788,4.3337,4.8262,0.7007,7.5652,0.9107,3.0612,1.2757,1.0798,0.0653,5.8676,1.9521,6.1387,4.3956,3.8779,1.9964,0.235,0.935,0.289,0.6691,1.743,4.8693,1.9668,8.5444,1.2993,3.1488,0.5215,0.9009,1.0722,2.3388,2.4211,2.5661,1.9835,0.9362,2.6671,2.1182,3.5956,1.1346,2.1936,1.4151,3.436,2.5351,2.777,0.6276,0.8598,3.1079,2.2124,1.537,1.3243,5.7733,2.7801,1.9925,2.1105,1.5539,3.1549,0.1057,0.0005,1.0526,0.6612,3.8552,5.7958,4.6603,1.4071,1.6819,0.5413,3.9665,6.4988,0.0034,5.3405,0.0768,0.0098,3.432,0.1921,1.9867,1.8701,1.6105]}
{"id":2817,"ended":true,"length":323,"text":"Towards the end of the 20th century, novel mathematical constructs such as fractal geometry and aperiodic tiling were seized upon by architects to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings. In 1913, the Danish architect, H\u00f8st, used an aperiodic tiling to design interiors for a large apartment house, while in the 1970s, the French-Canadian architect, Le Corbusier, built an apartment complex in which each unit of the apartment had its own different colour aperiodic tile on the wall, floor and ceiling. More recently, Richard Rogers has incorporated tessellated patterns into the fa\u00e7ade of his Pompidou Centre, and in 1999, Jony Ive of Apple (one of the most successful architectural projects in the world), and his partner Craig Rutledge, used a fractal structure to cover the interior surfaces of the Tate Modern building in London.\n\nWhat unites these architectural examples is that they all involve the use of aperiodic tiling ( and that is in itself not very surprising, given its use in art, literature and mathematics), but what is more interesting is that they give a glimpse into the mathematical thinking or creativity of these architects - and that brings us to the purpose of this website. Here you will have a chance to explore the mathematical world of the aperiodic tiling. I hope that I will provide you with an introduction to the concepts used and the mathematical tools involved, and at the same time bring you some creative and mathematical examples that will enable you to get a taste of this special kind of tiling. You will also be given the opportunity to become involved in the development of the website, and to suggest any mathematical or creative ideas that you think would be of interest to the readers of this site.","token_len":364,"entropy":[7.7528,0.0767,0.7891,0.2055,0.1583,0.7119,5.3274,0.055,0.1822,0.2536,9.5088,14.682,5.9105,2.4834,0.0011,6.5899,0.7908,2.6764,1.3229,5.3255,6.6697,0.0409,6.6745,2.7285,1.234,8.7503,0.6301,1.0005,5.6767,2.073,3.7794,7.4074,2.3929,6.057,8.8413,4.8868,0.6266,3.8754,0.8432,2.8303,5.2303,0.2652,2.0063,5.9363,1.2391,3.7101,4.1594,1.8595,6.554,6.2513,3.3713,3.6525,7.1122,0.1654,0.0984,0.7312,0.0288,1.0418,4.5064,8.1086,0.4668,0.9757,1.8933,3.4942,3.3471,5.3746,2.5989,3.4436,2.4207,2.9154,4.5361,0.0658,0.7451,2.1692,3.0145,3.3263,2.4752,0.6099,1.055,4.7096,3.5029,0.0364,0.0042,0.2185,4.4299,2.2362,2.9959,2.1091,1.0952,4.0973,5.4163,3.7536,4.5373,1.8988,3.5275,2.8441,1.4409,0.028,6.2167,4.7067,9.6229,0.858,0.0546,4.1906,4.7768,1.3735,3.2132,2.3531,8.3295,0.5979,0.6029,0.2989,5.9491,0.2846,0.0565,6.797,6.7617,3.0162,5.1891,3.2035,8.9391,0.0298,1.3455,3.8899,0.5107,2.6124,6.4741,0.0001,0.0788,0.1504,2.3362,7.0995,3.7103,0.3292,0.0002,5.8667,1.4302,2.7301,2.4653,5.5209,0.7035,7.2685,7.0701,0.4201,0.7954,3.4815,6.5157,9.0864,5.1145,0.0248,0.5868,2.9078,1.9583,4.0126,5.6247,1.0063,1.0559,0.6316,2.2487,4.3138,2.2989,3.4116,8.343,6.3282,1.4622,1.286,2.7851,1.7047,6.7934,0.0097,4.9094,0.6551,4.6523,1.3356,3.4761,6.2998,0.033,2.1422,6.2968,0.6018,3.468,1.0334,0.6179,0.4847,0.6676,0.0019,4.1836,8.6144,0.1027,1.6833,3.4932,5.3984,0.3791,1.4323,0.696,2.6068,4.4075,2.1976,0.8513,0.0049,2.2309,3.1762,0.0297,0.7904,0.0193,4.03,9.0819,3.8368,3.4486,4.3373,2.7898,3.5321,4.1483,3.6495,2.1584,1.0634,4.6639,3.993,0.7313,6.0663,2.744,3.2456,0.3859,5.4974,2.2733,2.4221,4.3409,1.9551,2.9739,2.3341,0.2843,0.6195,1.0677,6.7481,1.895,3.6391,0.5218,0.7408,6.0974,4.1753,8.3541,5.1776,1.3316,4.548,2.1489,5.5706,1.5551,2.7063,6.9432,0.1915,0.6462,0.9518,7.8843,0.1247,0.4787,5.401,0.4783,5.2928,4.1742,0.6132,5.7994,1.6228,2.9782,0.0136,2.5437,1.0127,3.1549,4.32,0.6153,2.0466,5.1825,0.0296,0.0315,0.4235,0.131,2.0605,4.2548,1.5168,1.2284,4.3508,3.3918,2.7283,0.9262,0.077,2.3189,3.0191,0.1607,0.9968,3.4675,3.7067,2.9182,1.6052,3.4572,3.5181,4.6081,2.2546,1.0141,5.7032,0.3907,0.7985,0.0011,5.2408,0.3421,2.1095,7.2941,3.0776,5.9618,3.5826,2.1621,1.4366,4.6692,0.0701,0.0195,3.991,1.4714,5.1515,0.1474,4.2495,5.7651,2.6851,0.0012,5.0922,0.0352,0.4547,4.6572,0.9493,0.764,1.9853,3.4144,1.3785,0.6241,0.0204,6.2541,2.6731,0.5366,0.9943,2.6765,0.1625,1.9975,5.1929,1.5071,1.4753,1.6842,6.0356,3.5225,3.2552,2.0901,3.4216,0.825,1.0453,1.0085,1.4286,2.2401,0.682,2.7879,0.74,0.4773,1.2154,4.2444,0.6312,0.353,1.5378,0.1588]}

On the defensive side of the ball, they ranked third in scoring defense (21.6 points per game), first in total defense (269.9 yards per game) and second in pass defense (131.4 yards per game). On offense, the Crimson Tide finished second in rushing (198.1 yards per game) and third in scoring (38.4 points per game).In addition, Alabama's team grade of 90.7 was very good for a bowl game. The team that won the national title last season earned a team grade of 89.5.For perspective, if you had put together a team that had had the average final statistics for a team that played in last year's national championship game, its grade would have been a combined 84.9. Alabama's average final postseason grade was the sixth-best in the last five years.Alabama is one of seven finalists for the Walter Camp Award for the nation's top player. Alabama defensive end Jonathan Allen also won the Lott IMPACT Trophy for the nation's best defensive player or unit. Auburn defensive end Dee Ford and Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron are finalists for the Maxwell Award, which is given to college football's top player.

{"id":3674,"ended":false,"length":343,"text":"The 32 @ - @ hour audio book of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell was released by Audio Renaissance in 2004. According to a review in The Boston Globe, reader Simon Prebble ``sounds [like] Stephen Hawking... [and] soars around the words, as if they're the fluttering seeds of exotic flowers.... The book's world is an imaginative wonder. But it's also a dangerous one, and the readers never fail to conjure the mood of imminent catastrophe. It's a feat of dramatic power rarely matched.''\n\nThis is one of my favourite reads and I've never once heard it read by Stephen Hawking, only by Simon Prebble. I don't like reading novels but the audio books are amazing and very moving.\n\nThe only way to read those books is really to commit to it - there are certain points where you have to just shut the whole thing off and go do something else until you come back and see how the plot is going because if you are like me and get distracted really easily, it can take ages. But I agree that the ending was satisfying, with a little resolution left for a sequel.\n\nI have to agree and I also found the narrator (Simon Prebble) quite excellent....but it took me a LOOOONG time to read. I'd really like to get back to this one day, as I would really like to know the answers to some questions that I had as the book neared its end.\n\nSimon Prebble's reading of this audiobook was brilliant, and as with most of his books on audio, that might not be the only reason I'm recommending them. I also loved these books. They're so interesting! It didn't help that the British covers for this title are such beautiful pieces of art!","token_len":368,"entropy":[9.2108,12.2838,8.0993,4.8704,8.383,8.2509,7.5131,3.9923,9.8193,5.3202,3.5615,6.9671,8.7044,1.4341,6.1196,2.9614,1.9646,5.9012,8.8719,1.6331,4.2175,0.5333,6.8449,0.0013,3.7712,4.0338,2.9275,2.0032,4.5086,0.1483,0.4884,11.7918,6.1891,8.8642,4.3594,0.86,11.8615,4.4548,3.8449,8.1794,3.632,0.107,7.1847,2.442,5.5571,4.3065,1.497,0.065,6.4026,9.0374,5.8379,1.0454,6.7693,2.1695,3.9957,0.5386,2.8059,1.5563,3.4242,9.0818,3.9408,7.7316,0.2141,9.5178,4.4018,5.8526,2.971,1.7328,2.6234,6.2726,1.7649,4.5107,6.1948,5.4383,3.8761,4.2736,1.3847,0.6607,0.9017,0.9047,6.2072,1.3175,1.9885,2.6278,2.7893,6.3718,5.5882,7.1979,0.0323,8.5925,0.0011,4.4436,7.007,1.1214,8.4636,2.5839,1.9242,2.7241,0.5891,1.4249,9.574,1.4147,6.5008,4.8649,6.4774,3.7068,1.8285,1.1068,0.0023,4.6883,1.7693,3.314,0.3637,3.437,3.241,5.4449,4.9648,2.0127,3.1681,2.5272,5.5054,2.9871,2.9974,4.7299,2.1593,5.2213,0.1588,1.9635,5.5836,0.8204,4.8297,0.0933,0.0026,0.0019,0.5102,2.7504,3.6928,0.001,3.6408,3.9974,4.7162,4.2551,3.7682,5.0996,2.6772,1.237,4.0365,1.9622,5.094,4.6882,0.5093,1.767,0.0003,2.7218,5.0796,4.3383,0.6312,2.7715,6.6382,0.8203,0.3989,7.3165,0.667,8.4782,0.3401,4.5706,4.21,4.8133,1.043,6.856,5.7834,1.3703,1.1532,2.9807,0.0703,5.1592,6.1942,2.2336,4.7125,0.1052,1.3654,1.5208,2.3727,4.4275,1.6045,0.5474,6.2326,0.3708,4.0902,0.6957,2.3565,3.5216,2.3075,2.5825,5.7983,2.7618,1.0637,6.832,3.5853,0.2793,4.0524,4.5839,0.3176,1.5161,5.2824,4.4067,7.0461,3.4041,1.1846,2.6268,2.3869,2.8056,5.0853,2.1156,2.942,1.7989,6.2611,1.3569,2.1025,7.8565,3.997,4.8351,2.047,4.6668,2.1257,3.9395,10.7024,7.2683,2.2226,3.7176,5.1047,0.8405,0.7519,0.0002,2.3997,3.1444,1.9936,3.1677,5.716,1.7077,4.4173,5.4165,1.3119,4.8186,5.0208,2.6337,0.349,0.0025,0.0015,0.1117,2.3947,6.4631,7.0786,5.4225,2.9291,4.2491,0.874,0.6535,11.5531,4.3873,1.5763,3.8307,0.2119,0.2331,2.6976,3.2897,1.6887,4.1904,4.6623,0.819,0.1882,3.6237,1.7388,0.3543,2.7846,2.7492,7.0055,1.878,3.9364,0.9231,4.4805,4.3969,0.3124,0.2142,3.7651,3.177,4.3427,0.455,1.8789,2.2766,2.1594,1.3839,2.6691,4.4765,4.396,4.0644,7.1499,0.0094,1.6707,1.0946,0.4131,0.7851,0.0002,4.1603,0.4146,0.003,0.0016,2.2521,6.2151,1.444,3.5738,3.3776,0.0008,1.9421,5.234,1.7063,1.5857,4.5863,4.2704,2.2354,1.3718,1.0882,1.9106,4.8123,3.5795,1.1486,5.0959,5.4591,2.2121,0.6455,1.2837,3.6671,2.4379,1.5385,2.7638,3.2173,5.3215,0.6446,2.0087,3.0976,4.4766,6.8954,2.7499,3.0249,2.3171,1.9118,3.3383,4.2851,4.8094,3.8908,5.7171,0.0006,5.1913,0.1464,1.7592,8.0602,11.2868,3.4104,2.4642,6.2722,1.4697,5.4514,4.9526,4.37,0.5951,1.1939,3.3366]}
{"id":345,"ended":true,"length":359,"text":"Shortly after the invention of movable type, highly variable spacing was created that could create spaces of any size, and allowed for perfectly even justification. Early American, English, and other languages have evolved to the point where the letters are very nearly the same size -- and the spaces are no longer varied -- causing the reader a great deal of fatigue in trying to determine the meaning of an entire \"word\" of text (which is now sometimes reduced to a fragment). I have often observed the American editor, working with word processors, attempting, in frustration, to reform our language into one based on a principle and use of space that makes it easy for readers to interpret individual letters. I also observe that the editor (often working with a team that includes the designer and\/or the designer's assistant) is very nearly never working with the actual layout of the typeface, but with a software tool that allows them to manipulate the spacing of the text they see on the screen or in print. If the spaces and justified letters in the original source were actually created with a very particular eye toward creating maximum legible legible legibility that should be the guiding consideration. As for font sizes and spacing, I have sometimes seen fonts set at extremely low print sizes and with extremely small spacing. Such fonts often make the content totally illegible. My guess is that most designers use these same tools as they work on their own home computers. If the original files were created by a human being, one could argue that this is one of the reasons of the many problems with electronic publishing. When I do work on home computers, I use the same tools that most home computer users use, and I end up with the same effects that home computer users end up with. I end up with illegible text, and with a layout that is not visually legible.","token_len":368,"entropy":[5.5154,1.4321,8.9338,0.422,9.0524,0.0176,7.2038,1.9555,9.9629,3.5412,6.763,2.4866,4.1951,3.5473,2.5824,5.4985,7.0037,3.4787,3.3897,1.041,1.9072,1.9421,6.1728,1.0969,7.5055,6.1772,13.1659,1.777,7.441,5.644,5.9609,3.6588,0.5982,0.4064,3.4848,1.8027,3.2219,5.6971,1.5798,3.5973,0.3681,0.4418,2.359,6.4477,2.1625,4.5418,4.2207,3.1382,0.0524,2.1957,7.9238,2.9332,2.6232,5.1251,0.8455,4.8663,0.3209,8.8039,4.9319,7.6236,2.0277,5.9151,5.8125,3.0141,0.0484,0.0534,8.7282,3.0638,4.5921,0.0359,4.113,1.3775,3.6083,0.243,3.468,2.4982,7.5605,1.1883,1.0382,3.8588,3.7924,4.2454,4.1145,1.2467,4.6255,5.6655,8.273,0.1095,1.6602,7.7763,2.0789,5.2014,2.4292,3.7467,4.5435,2.8239,5.8183,5.8385,2.4614,6.7997,1.8341,7.1968,3.8081,0.8236,5.0729,5.7945,2.2416,7.085,0.2544,0.0399,7.814,8.2894,2.8786,2.2372,4.0054,5.9737,0.2072,2.3022,8.1534,5.754,6.2619,1.5152,5.2793,2.4554,4.0969,1.4413,2.9216,1.1395,3.441,0.1185,3.9415,6.5421,2.5735,1.4325,2.8431,3.9938,3.6781,1.1563,1.7435,4.0439,4.9954,3.3146,4.4629,0.9565,1.7943,4.6143,4.2474,2.0818,2.6014,5.9015,2.0589,3.7106,0.0003,1.7305,3.0352,0.2481,2.8699,0.2496,2.1525,3.914,7.2098,5.5605,5.8965,0.6197,1.737,4.1486,6.6367,0.5264,0.5541,5.9101,2.1671,1.5721,3.5296,2.5821,1.6643,6.3242,3.1992,1.0021,2.223,2.5122,0.0466,4.6798,0.5108,3.5398,1.0641,1.3205,3.1056,4.7336,4.5049,2.2749,0.5433,0.7366,4.6503,2.4232,3.9302,0.3667,4.521,1.391,7.8145,4.2176,10.6714,3.7676,3.0681,1.2405,3.3767,5.9372,2.7636,5.0535,4.9255,2.9685,1.7916,5.011,5.2153,8.4566,4.0359,3.9206,6.5462,3.9012,6.3063,4.0343,3.4367,2.3677,1.032,5.0954,5.2843,1.1009,3.6815,5.77,8.7112,5.3765,4.0497,3.9453,7.6008,1.989,2.7444,2.6993,0.3479,1.5078,1.563,6.0587,1.5835,5.8685,6.3008,2.1611,6.5268,2.2825,7.7098,1.22,2.0784,4.0026,3.0166,2.7967,2.3633,1.1584,5.5042,1.7837,3.4132,4.4256,1.9531,6.207,9.0169,2.0041,0.0004,1.7455,5.1508,4.9414,0.1432,0.0983,3.1479,3.5399,3.8346,3.1153,3.9442,5.3983,3.8206,1.286,3.8381,2.135,1.7179,2.6806,7.7798,3.1843,1.1814,3.6997,2.0002,4.0207,7.607,1.4815,3.1769,3.4661,1.7208,4.3548,3.8694,0.8071,4.9606,2.0193,3.5582,0.1852,2.8775,1.6821,3.9022,0.3451,0.1217,2.4569,6.1163,1.0791,4.9001,2.7133,1.1458,6.9698,5.0293,0.6665,4.6985,1.9404,4.7771,3.5828,1.425,5.2172,0.7256,0.4476,0.5586,2.9767,2.2848,1.8983,1.1204,1.671,5.2893,2.9,1.5109,1.1212,0.4087,2.1291,1.5799,1.7839,6.651,0.0052,0.8157,2.3201,0.2058,7.7674,3.1825,6.1586,0.6291,0.1938,3.1643,0.0034,0.7225,1.1786,2.2549,6.6041,0.0027,0.5361,8.6851,0.0762,1.4313,1.9604,2.1125,4.2001,2.3907,5.8876,0.3076,0.9829,3.0311,5.7668,2.099,0.0022,0.7275]}
{"id":1592,"ended":true,"length":331,"text":"A tropical wave move off the coast of Africa on September 5, and crossed the Atlantic waters, the Caribbean Sea and eventually into the Pacific Ocean as a weak system. An area of low pressure became the system as it moved into the eastern Pacific Sea. Then, the next day, the system was named Isaias by WMO. It formed out of the convection that developed between the tropical waves (T-wave) of the west African coast and the Lesser Antilles.\n\nThe system then entered the east-central Pacific and moved into a less favorable environment to develop into a named tropical cyclone. However, it regained enough strength to become a tropical cyclone at about 1445 UTC on September 5. A Tropical Storm Warning was in effect because the system was expected to become a hurricane. The first warning for the hurricane occurred at 0200 UTC on September 6, when the hurricane became a hurricane and attained its peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km\/h), 2 mph (3 km\/h) below the threshold for a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The center of Isaias made landfall on the coast of North Carolina, southeastern United States at 0300 UTC (1830 EDT) on September 7.\n\nOn September 9, the center crossed the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and was located inland over Nova Scotia, eastern Canada before it weakened back to tropicalstorm intensity. During that time, Isaias dropped heavy rainfall amounts of 7 inches (200 mm) in western Nova Scotia and southwestern P.E.I. which caused flash floods. According to the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the storm also caused 5.1 million without power in the United States and the province of Quebec alone. Many buildings were left without any electricity too.","token_len":370,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,8.4553,5.0954,0.7911,1.0046,0.1001,5.2508,2.6608,3.1877,3.6081,0.3194,6.6092,8.6254,0.7246,2.4341,7.8365,3.6389,4.0403,4.3984,0.8003,0.5679,7.0681,1.7431,0.7954,1.6419,0.4604,5.3381,1.8792,7.1441,6.7419,1.887,6.4045,4.8786,0.8562,5.4518,0.7115,6.3116,1.9562,5.8312,5.1287,1.4082,2.7146,3.2549,0.5507,3.6923,1.1885,6.1443,1.091,6.1385,1.056,2.0877,6.4604,1.5388,0.2816,1.1679,1.9077,2.3093,6.7059,8.8504,5.1013,0.1079,4.0292,8.4912,5.3305,1.0837,3.2526,4.9715,5.3248,0.0359,1.2182,8.0169,0.5504,4.1351,4.6721,2.5807,0.5251,3.5636,2.4849,4.9871,5.0245,4.0997,1.6793,0.3284,3.9381,0.6515,4.7014,4.9366,2.9452,0.7063,0.312,10.6156,0.1075,2.5539,0.0146,1.5827,1.4809,0.007,1.5635,2.6246,4.5187,5.2857,0.378,5.518,3.9549,0.6227,0.5709,2.0778,3.543,1.5533,3.5457,6.381,3.7299,4.2201,3.2703,3.4184,2.0798,1.1118,9.5996,3.2426,2.7809,0.01,0.9413,4.6228,0.0228,1.804,9.9346,5.4522,0.8012,0.3435,2.5646,0.6122,1.6315,1.3145,0.0165,3.9704,4.2346,4.8338,6.0786,1.5075,1.0309,0.3765,2.2008,0.9802,4.1029,6.465,1.2137,2.5328,2.4038,6.3674,0.3865,6.4716,1.6974,1.0498,0.878,4.5437,0.0226,2.8447,1.0891,3.535,2.3989,2.0636,4.5629,4.0794,3.46,0.8717,4.155,3.1665,1.9453,5.1693,3.0423,0.1186,0.5203,0.0972,1.483,1.4287,2.3979,1.357,3.1983,4.688,0.8424,2.347,2.3634,9.9876,2.4793,3.4112,1.4696,2.1132,6.2266,1.9899,1.216,2.4702,0.7846,0.1626,0.0045,2.2757,7.3571,5.9181,0.0194,1.7255,0.2675,0.0068,0.0026,0.7009,5.0022,0.6629,5.7518,0.9443,1.7019,1.1392,3.2103,0.2385,5.337,3.4964,5.9309,1.5871,0.0187,0.0694,0.0108,0.0004,3.5048,7.6545,1.008,0.5469,1.5545,7.7301,0.8007,8.111,0.006,0.002,4.8946,0.1392,1.3303,1.7531,3.4303,0.1496,4.326,1.5522,2.1612,9.0524,3.9052,0.0092,4.1698,2.5855,2.4959,0.0888,3.6131,4.0123,2.4711,5.3148,1.1374,0.4183,0.1242,0.9146,0.554,0.8834,0.0002,3.6381,0.2194,2.1622,0.1668,0.9459,4.5587,5.4887,0.3474,6.5965,7.3006,0.127,3.1239,0.678,0.7306,0.9506,1.5636,3.2164,4.4454,6.9405,6.1882,5.8883,0.0,1.6919,5.5452,0.842,7.0066,3.3202,7.5399,5.5982,1.045,4.9565,9.1838,3.6184,1.6095,5.0059,2.2224,0.8568,0.2401,4.097,0.0006,0.0013,7.4038,6.2094,1.7876,6.8357,2.7951,4.7229,1.7544,0.3736,5.8903,0.849,0.1742,2.2216,5.5194,3.164,0.0021,1.2007,5.1407,10.3625,0.1922,0.0077,0.4182,0.0693,0.9527,6.8408,2.7856,6.2629,1.839,2.148,5.9665,0.0027,1.0385,5.0741,0.9134,4.5664,0.1296,0.0034,0.0024,1.3476,0.0281,0.014,0.1319,1.6209,3.0442,4.4378,1.6085,5.8999,3.3379,2.5148,0.9283,9.8583,0.0596,1.6964,1.7621,2.9799,0.0266,1.8389,3.3139,4.7228,0.0579,1.1307,5.9887,0.4644,6.708,6.0213,0.9832,5.3453,1.8939,7.3646,3.0889,11.2377,1.1794]}
{"id":4730,"ended":false,"length":337,"text":"At the November 2011 meeting of the Formula One Commission in Geneva, several teams were given permission to change their constructor names \u2014 the name recognised by the FIA as the entity that effectively runs the sport on the FIA's behalf. Although the teams can adopt a new name, the name of their engine supplier will remain the same throughout their career.\n\nRed Bull, Renault and Lotus were granted permission to change their names, while Ferrari did not apply. Ferrari's name is often misunderstood. For example, it is sometimes described as being owned by Fiat, rather than being a separate subsidiary like the above three and Brawn GP.\n\nAfter Ferrari won the 2008 constructors' championship, Fiat's stake was bought out by Enzo Ferrari's son, Luca. In 2010, Enzo Ferrari stepped down as company chairman and Luca became chief executive officer.\n\nFerrari won the constructors' championships again in 2010 and 2013, so there was no need for the Scuderia (the company) to change its name. In any case, the Ferrari name has been retained all the time since the team was founded in Maranello in 1929 by Sergio Villoresi.\n\nWhen the World Motor Sport Council handed Red Bull and Renault the rights to have their names changed in November 2011, Ferrari issued a statement, saying that \"nothing could change the name of our Group\" and it was \"essential that the history of Ferrari continues to unite members of the Ferrari Family as it has been doing right until today\".\n\nFerrari's president Luca di Montezemolo said at the same time: \"Ferrari and Maranello, the city in which the Ferrari Group is based, will always be the protagonist and the name of each and every member of Ferrari will remain Ferrari, while respecting the Formula One regulations.\"","token_len":370,"entropy":[2.5476,8.4364,4.4174,2.6713,1.7173,0.2558,10.5537,0.637,3.6566,2.5931,2.6497,0.0964,7.0474,2.9497,1.8895,3.2666,4.0252,0.0993,4.8577,0.8051,7.8014,3.2398,5.9258,2.5931,4.9101,11.0954,0.2617,1.0582,0.5406,1.8472,1.2541,9.2974,1.3091,8.9559,4.5208,0.4282,1.8624,4.9906,1.3102,2.8457,0.8692,2.1102,0.5688,5.9467,1.2042,4.5589,6.0815,5.7058,2.5263,0.7276,0.3868,1.1158,1.3652,3.7168,2.3197,2.3107,5.3304,1.4999,2.0522,1.0667,0.7134,0.0444,5.6471,3.2393,3.2718,0.6133,0.41,0.0003,6.7959,0.0228,2.1359,2.2325,0.5792,2.3059,1.9685,3.6521,1.153,0.3492,0.648,0.3287,1.6751,2.1588,3.0949,2.1331,5.2399,0.2125,7.6397,0.6639,4.2227,1.7296,2.5384,3.0094,5.7845,7.0072,2.4197,3.9261,1.2379,0.0516,2.2137,1.1567,4.1502,5.1477,0.1462,3.1163,4.4106,0.0465,5.3069,1.0471,4.4647,0.0039,2.9514,3.6271,4.9526,6.3389,9.1102,2.6384,9.184,4.2266,6.2524,8.0494,0.158,10.2827,1.1939,1.141,0.0001,5.2696,3.6494,3.5741,0.4845,4.7464,4.0248,0.0037,0.1401,0.1166,0.4368,7.0863,2.9862,8.4052,2.3075,3.0096,2.3911,0.3317,6.5983,0.8639,0.0198,3.0998,3.8016,0.8952,4.8626,0.0331,1.2355,2.653,2.5646,0.2535,2.6624,0.0033,2.3026,5.8656,0.2414,0.8171,5.6709,1.3362,1.3407,5.8263,0.0029,3.11,4.1587,0.1694,1.9526,0.6526,0.9934,0.0001,2.9664,0.2231,0.0012,4.3232,0.7063,3.9373,0.0002,0.0014,3.4662,3.4668,0.4028,2.444,1.4078,3.017,0.9517,5.4934,3.1278,1.5539,1.2124,1.9543,0.7119,1.798,8.8782,0.0011,0.0001,6.3986,2.3196,4.3154,5.9402,0.0489,1.0158,0.5845,0.1665,0.5593,3.0895,5.4838,0.3612,0.0191,1.3235,4.3805,1.0731,2.8079,1.2457,4.147,7.3287,1.0443,2.318,4.0509,2.0938,4.1359,2.2205,1.0488,0.859,9.2537,0.0239,0.0011,0.9247,5.5673,4.4017,3.9687,8.2843,9.4031,5.0276,0.9417,0.3915,0.0002,4.5787,1.4853,5.7122,2.0907,0.0351,0.6232,6.8182,8.3568,0.0035,3.2127,0.9044,1.6507,2.7421,0.125,5.9695,0.7031,2.2917,0.4887,1.7806,5.5862,0.8955,0.0868,3.024,5.2828,0.3445,0.6997,3.6684,0.9971,1.4423,2.1975,6.7648,3.5953,3.5625,0.7296,2.6949,0.5262,1.8461,8.3375,4.3477,0.9609,4.6522,1.3587,1.2235,4.5436,0.6147,1.406,6.3254,0.3495,3.6499,3.4598,0.6606,7.3636,6.076,0.4182,0.3633,4.3912,4.8386,3.6324,3.1297,1.7836,3.9188,5.1585,8.0758,5.3215,1.1354,0.6441,0.3149,0.0002,2.9269,0.0237,0.0113,1.5998,5.6745,4.18,0.0124,1.3398,0.063,0.0113,0.0002,0.0001,2.0099,3.9088,0.0706,4.2836,1.1861,2.1621,0.0231,3.1112,0.0337,0.0144,3.5299,7.0272,0.0712,0.0029,4.3828,2.517,8.1984,4.153,0.2085,2.2879,2.8709,4.2702,1.4896,0.6214,0.1135,2.9335,1.4831,0.8766,2.9422,12.7758,2.7961,1.7796,6.0208,0.5739,5.0,2.5862,0.0644,1.347,0.1448,3.0937,2.2883,1.8556,5.9566,2.4521,3.8681,6.824,0.749,8.1101,0.267,3.6184,1.7983]}
{"id":3557,"ended":true,"length":332,"text":"There are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for certain types of patrol.\nMounted police are expensive, inefficient and very dangerous for the riders who have to ride them. Horses are very, very good at getting away, and can kill you, if they feel threatened.\nI still have a feeling  that those police horses are mostly dead weight.     And yes, they can get away, but, in the time it will take them to do so, if they attack, they will lose, and not due to their inability to keep up, but because of the way they mount themselves      Also, in certain situations.     They are as good as people, if not better in some cases.\nHorses are incredibly versatile and highly intelligent. They're much better than people at dealing with unpredictable humans and many other non-predatory animals.   They're also a lot cheaper and infinitely more effective than horses.  I agree that they're great for specific situations, but I think there are other uses for police horses that are better and more cost effective.   It's the human riding them that's dangerous and that's where technology is replacing the horses\nI agree with all that, but I always have this feeling that horses are going to be useful for a long long time to come.  And as far as  technology replacing them, I still feel it is not true.   For example, they are very good at working with people who are not completely sane.    And a horse can be trained to do a lot of different jobs.   So the technology will not, by itself replace horses\nI agree horse care is also expensive too.","token_len":370,"entropy":[3.4462,4.9582,7.3682,0.67,13.5005,3.2763,3.7302,0.0473,1.527,1.211,6.1932,9.7271,2.3819,3.2615,3.0777,1.0811,5.4186,3.4262,0.5514,0.6254,4.409,0.6403,0.0437,10.0001,7.9232,2.3469,1.38,3.8243,6.4955,3.3975,5.4106,2.3917,0.0115,5.3646,2.3932,1.9594,19.899,0.1377,0.7559,2.8844,6.4399,1.2348,4.733,1.2816,4.1689,2.4603,3.1213,2.0828,3.8982,2.5471,3.8732,0.4422,3.3482,0.7074,0.4616,4.0694,1.2811,3.4411,4.7414,0.0046,3.4754,0.7844,4.4454,4.3137,2.339,1.0846,3.9663,5.8113,2.7421,3.1669,2.7999,1.4302,5.3243,1.0455,0.5236,1.6702,4.2755,6.1029,2.3123,1.7794,4.6628,12.4842,8.2006,5.4471,5.1081,0.8745,1.3112,6.642,4.1746,7.0447,1.3701,5.4949,4.8032,1.9859,1.884,4.6934,5.5996,0.1777,1.908,2.7293,2.9236,1.6519,2.5584,0.6315,5.399,3.0071,1.6719,5.9078,1.8935,4.6031,0.0094,2.2921,0.2679,3.4699,0.9587,0.1564,4.7161,0.784,6.7714,1.757,0.9464,0.8834,3.2978,6.1972,1.1778,4.7815,9.2348,0.0598,3.0262,5.9943,0.0231,3.6339,0.8324,3.0376,0.7598,1.0129,1.442,1.0278,3.5945,0.7576,7.8804,1.9253,7.2532,1.8971,0.689,1.0135,1.7486,9.7442,0.3893,3.877,5.0441,1.4457,6.4563,1.1509,0.2922,0.3824,0.998,3.9775,1.9082,6.481,2.2771,0.571,6.0048,3.5685,3.1504,0.2167,0.1079,5.2167,1.3068,1.7197,0.6245,1.0962,5.2479,0.3003,1.0346,5.2733,3.4683,1.9382,4.232,3.1633,0.9744,2.1217,4.5889,5.2978,2.2679,1.869,2.2326,1.8758,4.6586,0.0272,7.0334,7.1102,2.8838,5.7417,1.1396,5.2863,0.2309,6.5398,0.7209,0.8786,0.4856,1.6409,0.1459,4.4319,1.7263,1.5452,3.5324,2.7081,3.7906,2.4019,7.5067,0.5794,2.8719,0.7927,2.6417,0.965,0.9205,5.5562,5.9865,1.6606,1.9515,1.7349,4.2011,1.6429,6.4112,0.8824,0.7028,0.5088,2.1142,1.8339,3.2656,0.817,2.4675,3.7524,0.5678,7.2748,0.4279,1.7048,1.8218,3.3165,3.2669,1.1069,3.7376,0.5107,1.0269,1.6363,0.4302,4.8779,0.7457,3.7943,5.7735,5.7486,3.5762,1.0148,2.7224,7.8845,2.2873,3.6177,1.0902,3.47,6.5024,1.716,8.3208,2.631,2.4876,7.3654,2.61,3.8422,1.2177,4.1075,3.0908,1.2652,0.8357,1.1557,6.7933,3.4911,4.6752,1.0514,0.4518,2.8454,0.687,4.0475,0.056,1.2731,5.7318,1.4748,1.7227,1.8149,6.1269,0.0403,1.1848,0.0006,0.3922,0.7869,5.0139,4.1989,3.0807,0.0102,8.1179,8.2922,8.2745,1.8939,1.1154,0.9708,4.2024,3.0236,3.1155,2.0185,3.3296,6.305,0.7235,0.4986,0.7213,5.1566,1.1532,0.088,4.3877,1.1821,2.6428,2.1978,0.4105,6.5646,1.5886,2.9891,3.0223,0.8882,2.3971,6.4223,6.9709,1.1957,0.268,0.366,0.8403,2.2246,4.7821,2.3299,1.7942,1.817,3.0253,0.6983,2.0025,2.6038,0.749,0.2906,2.6383,3.3164,1.3914,0.5532,0.273,4.6242,3.8238,3.5536,2.7179,3.4525,5.4839,4.1206,0.1579,2.3712,1.9606,6.9426,1.654,1.9048,12.8339,6.2377,1.0676,5.4282,4.4799,6.884,0.4694]}

{"id":4275,"ended":true,"length":346,"text":"A multitude of languages are used by 35 million Canadians, with English and French ( the official languages ) being the mother tongues of approximately 60 % and 20 % of Canadians respectively. There have been several attempts to define the language situation in Canada, and to estimate the number of speakers of different languages, usually on the basis of the language of primary use by the respondent.\n\nIn 2006, the National Household Survey on Aboriginal Peoples (NHSAP) recorded 3.4 million Aboriginal people who spoke an Aboriginal language other than English, compared to 1 million Aboriginal English speakers ( see Table 2 ). The 2009 NHSAP found that there were approximately 4 million Aboriginal people who spoke languages other than English, which was virtually identical to the number recorded in 2006.\n\nBased upon the 2009 statistics, as well as data from the 2005 Census of Canada, it has been estimated that approximately 7.1 million Canadians speak an Aboriginal language other than English. This translates to 13.0 % of Canada s total population and is more than in any other country where Aboriginal languages are spoken. Aboriginal languages in Canada are also highly diverse and range from those with a long history of use to those that have survived only through use by a small number of individuals. In addition, there are four official Aboriginal languages.\n\nBased upon the 2009 statistics, the population that speaks an Aboriginal language is higher than the total Aboriginal population, although the total population is larger overall. This is because there are many non-Aboriginal people speaking other Aboriginal languages, including many who are not Indigenous, but who only speak an Aboriginal language due to their proximity to Indigenous communities. According to the 2009 NHSAP, over a third ( 36.1 %) of non-Indigenous Canadians who were of Aboriginal descent and spoke an Aboriginal language spoke an Aboriginal language at home ( see Table 3 ).","token_len":370,"entropy":[11.283,0.0077,6.7803,2.1239,2.2181,2.9507,11.7521,1.3694,5.3953,1.4583,2.9134,3.3949,2.3547,0.4553,5.4713,9.793,4.0132,0.6227,1.8368,1.9256,0.6073,9.6384,4.7379,0.5488,4.6443,3.781,5.441,4.6322,3.6269,0.0355,0.1811,2.3736,2.9671,0.3308,4.4791,3.7824,0.1737,2.53,2.3123,0.4272,3.8893,1.1602,2.6443,10.2628,1.0001,0.3234,1.3027,2.312,3.1947,5.6426,0.5642,2.1248,0.0862,2.9383,0.8557,2.754,0.2721,2.2016,7.4811,5.2314,1.242,0.1093,0.0023,1.9448,3.8457,3.2212,7.955,4.5118,5.0442,1.4033,3.6331,0.6522,2.7284,0.0006,2.8,4.0623,0.4336,1.1563,4.1427,2.7992,0.0381,2.0308,4.79,1.2032,1.0674,1.5456,0.0881,5.8239,0.3195,5.3091,4.9209,1.2281,2.3942,0.1866,2.3031,1.7924,4.001,2.3279,4.4643,1.3628,0.1349,6.3019,0.0012,0.0629,1.7501,4.2635,0.9072,1.6296,4.0639,2.5601,5.9125,0.2401,1.9275,7.5319,1.8751,1.8221,0.433,1.5036,6.0646,6.608,0.0158,4.4897,0.3569,3.2192,0.3181,2.8094,3.2144,1.7801,0.6943,0.8347,1.1017,0.7922,5.9299,0.0565,0.0061,0.0396,1.0498,3.6157,2.0582,7.9266,1.5531,0.1305,0.2453,2.0738,4.4052,0.7733,0.9988,0.6227,1.4081,0.0002,5.8792,3.7751,0.6845,4.1114,5.7336,0.3264,5.9291,2.7726,0.0039,3.4857,0.6472,0.9735,3.909,2.3998,1.8272,2.2685,0.5702,3.1607,2.6393,0.1038,1.1714,0.0507,2.6494,3.6584,1.0065,2.5697,0.1466,1.9326,1.8674,0.8173,0.1684,0.0637,0.9117,0.0041,0.0173,1.2282,1.8972,3.4595,0.4146,6.7992,0.1823,3.599,1.0163,0.1016,3.1903,11.3856,3.0416,0.9917,3.514,2.7081,3.9586,0.0191,6.223,0.7988,0.251,0.6789,4.3744,3.1254,1.6787,0.2415,0.5091,0.4788,5.1744,0.6582,2.9787,0.5047,0.6451,2.7076,4.9637,4.2042,1.6561,5.3345,0.499,5.5748,3.5022,2.0073,5.1928,0.7701,0.4374,2.8268,0.7798,0.3699,1.2028,1.1352,5.1725,5.9872,2.2447,5.5991,2.4598,2.8211,2.7349,0.5402,0.054,1.4459,0.5531,2.7744,2.1292,0.2221,2.0849,0.6052,6.4792,4.5805,3.8437,0.1364,3.9991,1.1354,0.0002,4.9304,0.5867,0.5085,1.6377,1.2673,0.0695,1.931,4.5949,6.211,1.1811,0.4242,0.096,0.0276,2.255,5.6918,0.561,1.4104,2.1386,3.4836,0.1075,2.3968,3.1801,1.8204,3.6006,1.5666,1.4834,4.3349,5.5399,0.7091,2.873,1.2657,1.5741,2.4507,0.311,2.962,4.0018,0.0237,2.6975,0.0003,0.0002,0.0106,2.0805,4.8028,5.2131,1.5174,0.0451,1.2969,2.2856,3.0468,1.4774,1.5275,1.9303,6.2259,1.9232,2.8607,1.1348,7.6018,0.405,2.9507,0.4346,0.1317,7.2389,0.0041,1.6587,5.1998,0.061,4.0943,1.2858,0.538,5.2448,0.0029,0.6292,1.307,3.5745,0.0034,0.4784,4.2475,4.1103,0.8294,2.0486,7.3605,1.0948,2.341,0.3424,2.5674,0.0259,3.6743,0.0051,3.729,0.0009,1.8946,3.1861,3.738,6.0035,0.9711,1.2854,3.7336,3.0777,0.6335,0.1482,0.019,3.1187,0.8746,0.557,0.0872,2.9172,2.6563,2.685,3.146,0.3311,0.9281,0.2295]}

{"id":4032,"ended":false,"length":362,"text":"The Beatles were performing at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961, when they were introduced to Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was homosexual. According to biographer Philip Norman, one night Epstein showed the band a new song he had written titled \" All I Really Want to Do.\" It was a hit, and while the lyrics were \"pretty good,\" The Beatles were \"not that interested \" in the lyricist being gay. Although \" All I Really Want to Do \" was the first song Epstein ever wrote, it was Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison who came into his orbit. Epstein recorded and produced \" All I Really Want to Do \" for them in two versions. One version featured the acoustic guitar part on vocals by the band but had the words printed and was intended for Lennon as a present. This version wasn't released until the Sgt Pepper reissue years later. The second version of the song was the same except the music was much more intense and faster and was much harder to sing and had lyrics in big red letters. It was Lennon's favorite version, so Epstein bought a copy for $20,000. The song was recorded again for the British release of A Hard Day's Night and to be included on their 1968 Sgt Pepper album. It was later recorded again for the album Magical Mystery Tour. The title is a possible reference to the Beatles playing early gigs at the Cavern Club, as well as the title of a book by Ewan MacColl about the club's first act, Arthur Brown. Lennon also wrote a book about the club. During the first few weeks of Epstein' s working relationship with the Beatles, McCartney and Lennon grew \"impersonal\" toward him. However, the two eventually became friends again. The Beatles were the only group Epstein ever helped produce.\n\nThe Beatles performing in front of the Cavern Club","token_len":370,"entropy":[11.2157,2.7185,6.6416,1.4545,6.064,0.4176,7.675,0.3352,1.2543,4.1504,4.4697,1.2345,2.0548,1.3991,1.325,5.5235,0.2462,9.8772,5.0252,1.8495,9.2212,1.8332,1.4896,2.5237,1.8297,9.738,1.9215,4.3572,0.0006,7.7844,0.2484,5.2917,7.6473,0.2555,4.6927,4.548,1.8558,5.0039,3.3639,3.09,1.2268,5.7978,2.8449,3.1341,0.9108,0.2658,5.8325,0.4946,11.5668,2.039,6.3592,0.3918,3.2803,0.363,4.2252,2.9776,0.7049,2.2701,4.3849,1.2478,0.7816,5.4914,1.8411,3.9622,0.7876,3.696,5.2358,3.0762,0.4291,7.7035,0.1686,1.6489,2.79,2.7031,3.5611,3.1378,9.3945,0.3549,1.6575,5.6523,3.4683,5.9475,0.8925,0.3539,6.3369,4.6559,4.5228,0.015,0.0123,0.0067,0.0701,0.0181,0.5699,0.948,2.898,1.2332,1.1076,2.938,2.6976,0.7982,0.687,1.1757,0.6994,8.6124,0.9725,3.3923,5.9316,0.1729,1.0504,2.0069,0.0491,0.5611,4.3642,5.1646,3.5521,6.3466,0.6885,2.3855,6.0367,3.4365,2.5643,2.637,2.4219,0.0376,0.0112,0.0151,0.0919,0.0222,0.476,2.4273,4.3106,1.6538,6.8639,5.0213,1.4731,2.6088,1.2459,2.943,2.1514,7.9339,0.6654,5.1068,4.1323,5.4317,2.2672,2.7382,2.4738,7.1175,4.288,1.9209,5.4357,6.0465,6.2806,4.2281,4.7344,1.2009,4.0842,3.8679,0.9188,7.5532,0.7016,4.6921,0.2153,6.1252,0.001,2.4793,0.3755,2.5568,11.2469,1.106,10.3228,0.3367,6.2564,0.0467,0.6862,1.8292,2.6365,0.1107,2.7513,0.5164,0.2125,1.3391,3.584,3.5884,4.7173,2.0859,6.1477,0.4573,4.9495,0.8244,5.6269,1.2225,7.6879,3.0924,2.3846,4.46,4.2887,0.1904,2.1653,2.4299,4.9666,2.6611,3.741,7.2873,4.1801,0.507,0.7634,2.6082,0.691,6.5058,0.8023,4.9517,2.2237,1.6747,3.8092,3.7969,5.9833,2.5249,0.4053,3.0023,3.0917,2.9453,1.4419,0.5769,0.9766,2.0176,2.2206,1.0135,2.8804,4.8373,2.4371,1.6232,6.108,4.1842,0.8911,5.992,3.0963,0.0495,0.0009,0.0002,2.698,7.3696,2.1491,4.4114,1.2902,4.3941,4.7097,7.3692,0.1778,1.6496,0.5628,2.6497,0.6892,4.1227,3.4959,3.4034,0.5704,0.7342,3.6623,8.5668,1.2963,0.0151,1.5316,1.9316,6.1084,4.815,1.3846,6.8593,0.3091,0.0038,0.9661,2.0411,3.9356,8.2859,5.5497,1.1965,1.2094,2.7789,0.0109,2.1029,3.3116,1.8691,0.0072,1.5305,4.2445,0.7841,1.9085,4.6542,1.3389,6.1312,4.7789,4.5542,6.3168,2.3984,1.6117,5.5823,1.9029,4.7006,7.3526,1.5349,8.9499,5.0404,0.8759,5.1246,3.3053,2.0821,1.8885,3.4715,0.601,0.4417,0.9946,2.7405,5.1049,0.9359,4.1779,2.5986,2.0249,0.229,6.2597,8.1484,5.4645,6.645,1.8743,0.0463,1.9216,0.7936,0.1857,5.2064,2.3328,1.6741,7.1338,5.6566,7.1366,5.4047,0.8541,3.8515,2.2852,0.6707,5.062,0.0169,2.679,2.0519,3.4177,1.7634,2.1065,3.0044,1.5665,2.8101,1.4715,2.3116,3.8968,1.7325,3.017,3.6941,1.0803,5.5487,3.4416,1.7426,2.8163,0.0359,2.6962,0.8552,7.7151,2.1539,4.4972,0.0017,1.0322,4.4856,0.0058]}
{"id":424,"ended":true,"length":343,"text":"The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy based on the British model, with a written constitution and a popularly elected president who has mostly ceremonial powers. The government is headed by a prime minister \u2013 the taoiseach \u2013 who serves as a member of the legislature, or the D\u00e1il, and who is appointed by the president on the advice of the party leader in parliament. The president may appoint a caretaker prime minister (or, in the rare case of a minority government, a senior member of the party that is the single largest one). There are two official languages \u2013 Irish and English and, along with Ulster Scots and French, they make up the two official forms of government recognised by the Irish government. The parliament is called the Oireachtas and the D\u00e1il as its legislature. The government may be defeated in the D\u00e1il and its members may retire, but the D\u00e1il may not pass a motion of no confidence in the government and the government is not dissolved.\n\nAlthough most areas of public policy are directed by the ministers of government, the president also has considerable powers to nominate various non-elected individuals to serve on various bodies such as the boards of constitutional review and to form a constitutional convention (for which the D\u00e1il may propose bills and the government may propose amendments ). The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term; their main powers are vested in the power to sign the government\u2019s various bills into law and dissolve both houses of the Oireachtas. There are six ministers of state who are also members of the D\u00e1il: one each on foreign affairs and justice, two each on education, national administration and government, finance and revenue and social protection ; and the ministers responsible for energy, agriculture and food, communications, health, local government, and transport.","token_len":371,"entropy":[9.7623,0.6631,1.6115,2.5199,1.9487,6.0898,1.6368,4.4197,0.1781,0.8293,5.7208,5.9002,1.9075,2.2743,1.6844,7.0352,0.0663,1.297,1.5797,5.685,6.5351,0.0522,2.8045,4.0304,2.2826,9.4976,6.088,1.2854,0.3412,1.6688,3.1681,1.6587,5.9675,0.0206,0.9875,3.5947,0.0095,5.8999,2.0316,10.4448,0.0647,0.0001,0.0,0.9495,1.4212,3.9144,0.9644,1.7688,2.3718,0.019,0.7336,4.6338,2.0345,3.8323,2.6432,6.3133,0.1729,0.0089,1.5231,1.5623,2.6602,1.3197,3.5066,0.3195,0.4488,2.3208,4.7853,2.4518,2.0499,0.0902,0.6886,5.0495,2.5784,4.9879,3.7432,0.1726,1.5145,3.081,4.8019,1.956,1.5438,10.7083,0.0956,1.4631,0.0015,3.4438,3.4366,2.8642,1.3621,0.8692,5.2349,1.4104,0.3386,0.6157,4.76,0.2606,0.0797,0.9483,5.3134,2.0625,0.1215,0.5406,3.0845,5.4877,1.916,3.9813,6.275,0.6239,6.723,2.3109,4.2045,0.6862,2.0968,6.3355,4.3002,3.105,1.5247,0.1053,0.1184,5.6596,1.8154,6.645,0.0541,7.3539,4.8018,2.119,5.2928,0.2266,4.6469,4.5423,0.0084,1.4398,5.7351,3.4375,5.5366,0.0508,0.3577,8.6806,0.5924,0.3215,1.9999,2.3605,0.2791,1.7843,5.7631,1.1513,5.7536,0.4965,6.1519,0.0195,0.0,0.0,1.6615,2.2473,2.2634,0.0491,0.0002,5.2325,4.1638,5.0923,1.1858,1.5121,2.4283,5.0055,2.7675,7.6364,1.8185,1.532,2.6354,0.001,0.0004,2.5537,2.572,2.3084,2.241,7.2497,2.5703,1.6251,1.3754,1.9406,0.0032,0.0021,3.5701,2.81,4.8392,1.3913,4.2399,1.7393,0.3329,0.0237,1.4355,0.3398,0.7041,2.8905,1.3787,2.2728,2.5361,2.092,2.7369,0.3763,0.9878,0.0004,4.9882,4.0536,7.1594,0.2163,4.5695,2.8555,0.917,7.1348,2.1472,0.4192,7.58,1.2412,2.6991,0.3958,1.4987,5.524,4.2182,1.1176,5.6258,1.8657,2.3406,5.5202,6.5093,5.8666,0.011,2.3785,4.5003,1.1571,2.0341,1.4228,3.855,4.0357,4.5207,0.001,0.3452,7.9173,0.1665,7.4017,4.7931,1.3555,4.1469,4.104,2.2498,4.4727,3.0741,3.9208,4.2307,3.1641,1.7894,1.7652,0.0072,0.0013,3.799,4.9729,6.5996,2.4377,4.7624,2.7037,0.326,2.0561,0.847,7.5046,1.4322,1.3681,1.883,3.1182,0.8143,4.6999,0.3968,4.9551,1.7814,3.2621,0.1006,0.0379,0.1257,4.5461,8.3242,6.2617,3.9843,0.2107,6.4496,0.1197,0.4804,8.6502,0.5896,5.6173,2.0888,6.213,16.9058,9.0444,7.4353,8.0664,1.6673,3.0523,0.0117,1.8883,7.4788,7.4196,1.0045,0.2445,1.7602,3.4276,0.0047,0.0018,0.0006,1.0894,4.054,0.5386,4.0826,5.1583,1.4188,0.959,2.8776,0.9758,2.8841,1.726,0.0098,0.2839,1.1523,0.0015,0.001,2.747,3.7309,5.6216,4.984,6.4951,0.4846,1.0656,3.676,1.1709,2.2741,4.113,0.2775,3.5888,0.9431,6.2605,8.851,0.4636,5.5834,4.2858,8.0577,0.4876,6.5578,1.8974,5.9528,3.2306,7.0314,1.9438,2.4449,5.2663,4.4038,0.0693,6.1685,0.5665,2.7583,0.6069,5.2982,2.601,6.742,0.9866,2.2666,1.1106,6.7807,0.8588,1.0726,3.2978,3.6963,0.5054]}

Funding is provided mainly from sales taxes, which have been on the rise since 2001. Although Unicamp receives much less money per student, the fees are higher, causing its costs per student to be greater than other state universities.\n\nUnicamp is an open access institution, which means that every registered student has the right not only to admission to the university, but also to any academic, scholarly, and research content produced by the institution, up to the fourth academic year of registration. This is due to the high percentage of open access publications among professors at the institution.\n\nUnicamp has had a strong scientific and research agenda in the previous decades, as demonstrated by its numerous awards won from different parts of the world. These awards have been given to the whole university, including the Center for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, among others.\n\nUnicamp has been among Brazil's foremost research institutions in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in the field of immunological research. The school has a notable record in drug discovery and clinical trials, and has even had several notable discoveries.\n\nUnicamp also has a very strong social engagement agenda where it is working intensely on issues such as access to education, health, and the environment. Unicamp is known for its commitment to these issues through various initiatives including various social programs as well as its involvement in various scientific and medical forums and initiatives.\n\nUnicamp is also home to the Center for Biological Diversity, which is one of the largest centers of its kind in the country. The Center works in research and development activities that focus on the protection of biodiversity and the environment. The center also undertakes education activities on these topics too.","token_len":371,"entropy":[6.0238,7.0918,3.9718,2.3311,6.6485,0.2423,11.1041,6.8067,1.7788,6.5508,1.8288,2.7958,0.2045,1.7217,1.668,1.5507,5.2302,5.389,7.1926,0.2679,6.4236,1.3934,5.7407,1.5379,3.2563,0.0131,0.013,0.8679,8.1465,1.9425,2.1764,4.1195,3.7011,7.1913,2.6684,1.3372,1.5085,4.1069,0.9919,5.3558,0.2401,0.6986,2.0123,4.8546,0.6667,5.2499,2.3316,0.0142,4.9556,4.4267,1.9925,2.0126,3.6682,0.5546,2.0751,1.9462,6.3894,1.3276,2.5482,2.8664,7.4954,3.5935,4.3391,5.8691,0.5924,0.1013,2.1623,4.8621,0.7086,3.5716,5.3335,0.7814,0.4972,0.8975,0.0018,4.2809,0.0272,0.0223,1.9813,3.6083,4.0347,4.7721,2.5648,1.2706,1.9723,0.4184,0.371,5.2663,8.2537,0.4314,1.848,1.3103,0.7243,6.1562,2.1642,0.0117,10.4148,1.2951,1.1031,0.7899,0.7895,0.0175,0.1912,0.5096,5.1914,4.7132,4.1183,5.7693,0.8697,1.7306,3.0105,5.7039,5.8648,1.07,0.7553,1.8242,2.3861,6.4605,0.0373,2.0884,6.5093,5.8643,0.081,1.8778,6.1818,0.2863,2.7722,2.0573,4.3526,0.1736,0.5217,4.291,4.8227,0.0702,6.0502,0.456,4.7376,5.4573,5.0655,3.7246,0.7853,2.9837,0.7729,1.3222,0.0002,1.9952,0.0544,0.0191,2.3317,4.7536,1.1426,3.2442,7.7922,1.3972,3.7677,3.5438,2.3507,0.9738,5.4496,3.3265,0.5886,2.92,3.8834,0.1204,0.9026,5.6965,5.708,7.9274,3.6273,5.4599,6.5806,0.002,0.1924,0.3393,0.7905,3.5202,2.0465,1.5997,1.7329,3.1771,1.0181,2.4504,8.2561,3.0139,1.5744,2.2807,1.4377,6.6506,0.3662,6.5343,1.0899,0.0213,1.152,6.5314,0.0903,0.9807,4.5607,0.18,0.3399,0.9824,0.0002,1.5811,0.04,0.0159,1.8177,2.357,5.1365,3.7488,0.0109,5.2507,2.1009,1.2312,2.2294,0.8491,8.7237,1.335,1.1457,5.1557,1.0418,0.5955,1.9069,0.004,4.2275,3.6735,1.9977,0.6246,2.1379,4.3084,1.3371,2.3679,7.665,4.5339,2.0376,6.0805,1.2831,1.3422,3.5073,0.6258,0.5936,2.0282,1.383,5.0954,4.1024,3.9347,5.3917,3.1032,3.614,0.973,0.0002,1.2698,0.0163,0.0142,2.1162,0.639,0.7473,3.1683,1.5952,4.255,6.032,4.8908,6.5544,1.4447,2.0643,3.3417,8.454,2.0482,3.2649,1.4205,0.0013,5.334,0.2171,1.7137,0.5722,1.9071,1.6376,0.9483,2.5188,0.376,0.4577,4.9098,0.0265,1.5265,4.4328,0.324,0.6951,4.7796,0.1059,7.5881,0.8939,3.7573,4.2524,1.6528,2.2236,5.566,2.7751,2.8407,5.0048,0.0311,0.0123,3.0569,4.1073,0.2973,3.129,5.2276,1.4266,3.7496,6.4524,2.9065,3.0869,0.5274,0.3079,0.0002,1.4249,0.0188,0.0129,1.1662,1.221,4.9254,0.0128,1.6728,5.2328,0.0759,4.0395,0.6167,0.7885,1.2048,1.2011,2.9924,0.0145,0.2565,1.6761,5.5884,0.6758,6.2955,0.1777,0.1627,0.5423,1.8593,0.4534,1.6448,1.0614,3.4931,2.9749,8.1771,1.3284,2.6177,5.6383,3.4795,2.9411,0.0724,1.4014,4.0333,0.3617,0.5869,1.0792,1.2261,1.4399,0.6953,1.9958,1.8677,1.5415,7.3453,0.0013,5.1388,3.4241,3.0689,5.6158,1.5125,7.9783,0.6299]}

She joined the Herald's staff in 1982, writing a general interest column entitled \" The Artful Curator \" in which she featured both local artists and foreign collectible dealers.\n\nWhen I first went to work for The Miami Herald in 1982, my main job was writing for our weekly feature, \" The Herald's Gift. \" It was the Christmas shopping guide. There was a whole lot of art included. My next biggest project was \" Out & About,\" the paper's calendar. Then we began doing the Sunday Arts section, where there was a huge showcase of art. We included one exhibit per month of about 15 paintings, and this was something I really loved to do.

Two previous attempts to take Maryang San by American troops had been unsuccessful. Regardless, the task was considered important enough that it was ordered by a general to be \"priority, priority, priority.\" Hassett, while a junior commander, had been ordered by another general to form an assault \"assault, assault, assault\" for Maryang San. Hassett was told not to wait for American tanks, but instead to use infantry and tanks in the attack.\n\nThe Americans believed Hassett to have the better of the battle, and one historian has stated he was likely to lose only one tank in the fight. At about 12:45, however, Major David A. Bader of the 101st Airborne landed near the front of the American line on a C-130 transport aircraft. Bader was a \"charter member \" of B-26 Marauder crews, but the plane was unarmored and incapable of fighting back if attacked. The soldiers around Bader panicked and allowed it to be destroyed, which prompted the commander of the 101st Airborne, Major General Anthony C. Zinni to order a general retreat.\n\nAmerican commanders were puzzled by the Japanese retreat; one officer recalled that Hassett had looked \"frightened.\" However, the Japanese had been waiting for an American landing before launching a final counterattack at Maryang San. General Tsuribasaki stated that he had ordered a retreat after being informed that Hassett was preparing an assault, which convinced Tsuribasaki to allow the Japanese to attack at Maryang San. Japanese forces began to mass nearby shortly after.\n\n\"The tank was hit by a Japanese shell and immediately became incongruously airborne.

Artists including the Jefferson Airplane, the Byrds, Donovan, Richard Manuel (Paul Simon ) and Joan Baez were contacted about recording the tracks. Baez was also in touch with Dylan, but she only recorded \" Love Me Like a Man \" for an album she recorded in 1969. Some of Dylan's songs from the acetate were released, albeit remastered, as part of Dylan At Carnegie Hall, a collection of bootleg recordings from Dylan's first live performance at Carnegie Hall in 1962.\n\nDonovan said that the demo of \" A Hard Rain's A Gonna Fall \" was made as a kind of joke, and he only learned that it has become a hit after a friend pointed it out to him a few years after the song's chart success.\n\nDylan liked the song, and had Bob Dylan do the vocals for a recording which would include all of the original compositions recorded by Dylan on the acetate. The recording took place at Abbey Road Studios on 8 February 1968, and was issued as Dylan at Woodstock. At the same session Dylan also attempted to cover Baez's \" It Don 't Worry Me \", as well as playing the flute on Don Everly's \" Bye Bye Love \" although this appears to have been a one-off and not one of the recordings of the acetate.\n\nThe song also became of the band?s most famous hits, and has been performed at both live- and studio-recording sessions by the band since.\n\n\" A Hard Rain's A Gonna Fall\" was released as a single in the UK in April 1968 and was a Top 40 hit, reaching number 28.","token_len":372,"entropy":[7.8253,6.8927,0.295,4.5979,9.8747,1.8693,4.305,9.9194,5.9383,10.469,0.0401,5.316,1.0715,4.5386,3.0283,5.7289,1.5214,11.7264,7.4898,4.0839,6.0604,5.6097,5.6377,5.4054,2.2058,2.2612,0.3774,3.703,4.0693,0.4092,1.2494,1.4073,0.4511,7.761,3.9528,3.6576,8.8435,0.2646,0.0053,1.3219,2.17,4.8474,0.001,0.1809,10.0544,0.6718,6.8919,10.4237,4.5606,7.6721,3.1025,7.9586,0.1645,6.8572,0.7894,0.0008,2.3696,5.9178,3.7644,2.701,1.5091,4.8508,0.8744,6.8051,0.1473,2.2695,3.6047,4.0332,2.8057,0.2046,2.2718,1.5645,2.3432,4.3773,5.1939,3.1794,4.3889,11.3772,2.9082,2.2143,2.2643,2.8187,0.746,2.3984,4.031,1.3738,4.4881,3.3589,2.2656,3.5153,0.5083,5.8132,0.6035,2.5345,0.0079,1.8228,4.8149,1.213,10.4223,0.055,1.0322,3.0217,4.0413,7.3495,7.0752,0.8096,1.8667,3.1099,2.2428,0.0012,4.1885,9.418,10.766,0.0845,2.0212,1.9651,5.1886,0.2115,7.6681,0.0265,1.6709,2.5689,4.034,0.334,3.706,4.1967,1.7133,2.1842,0.914,0.0255,0.9369,4.559,0.1875,1.7065,0.0156,7.5232,1.2053,6.2959,1.3721,2.1647,7.2906,3.1128,0.7681,7.0188,5.337,4.0038,0.1971,0.6583,8.3895,1.4594,0.9163,0.6294,0.8395,3.2485,4.2165,0.7143,5.292,0.003,5.6769,1.6383,1.4839,2.1497,6.4259,5.0462,2.9638,1.6775,7.3842,4.2682,0.9347,3.5762,2.5312,2.6615,4.8504,5.3584,1.8291,0.0089,0.2942,0.1714,4.2501,0.4038,0.9498,3.5282,1.2603,3.3526,1.7698,10.0189,3.0742,0.3789,2.1585,0.0002,2.5631,0.01,6.6866,1.1337,2.9614,1.3561,1.0314,4.8319,8.7115,0.1012,4.4869,1.6478,2.8146,1.4557,4.0969,3.9467,6.4062,1.9425,3.1755,3.9003,1.1372,1.0213,3.6138,3.4914,5.2758,1.6858,1.3405,3.6456,1.1521,3.4982,0.0235,0.4468,2.5495,3.0233,5.1131,0.3885,1.6466,6.955,0.0113,0.4838,4.0179,6.2546,2.4521,1.6723,0.8419,1.403,1.9658,6.6043,1.7458,3.577,3.202,7.8179,0.137,2.1778,4.8107,0.8399,2.9777,6.3995,2.4881,2.9608,6.4801,0.1213,5.7831,7.4088,1.2375,0.4963,0.9915,5.7481,6.445,8.2808,2.2634,5.7948,2.7325,4.0757,5.418,4.3496,1.3103,0.0211,5.7616,1.7284,6.3969,0.3486,2.8824,7.4023,10.2879,3.789,0.5391,1.2707,8.5664,0.0872,6.1681,1.0464,8.4971,2.8613,6.4213,0.2106,0.2596,0.3931,2.2254,5.1062,0.2111,0.1686,3.6182,2.7819,5.0239,0.6193,1.266,4.1149,2.9198,1.0894,5.2331,0.0112,0.4819,0.8497,0.0001,2.1153,3.2413,3.8997,3.1573,7.8674,3.7703,3.6915,12.2893,1.6292,2.6818,2.4012,5.7125,0.851,2.5197,4.2583,1.0751,4.5435,2.0352,4.8986,5.5871,5.7516,3.3117,1.5315,1.1802,6.8522,0.0261,1.567,3.7185,1.4946,1.046,2.0615,2.4801,1.2105,0.0002,3.6536,2.7528,0.1572,0.0009,0.0594,0.1393,0.0102,0.0363,0.007,0.7368,1.1369,2.358,1.9864,0.6642,1.4108,0.9975,2.9016,1.9114,1.1348,4.6204,2.2824,2.257,1.6162,3.4624,4.5303,1.7505,0.2788,2.8026,3.4161,1.2678,6.2816,3.0735]}

{"id":1676,"ended":false,"length":346,"text":"MTV's Josh Wigler thought the episode was `` a touching, sad tale with a healthy mix of mythological advancement, `` and couldn 't wait for more episodes about the Observers. Ramsey, meanwhile, was shocked by the alien's existence. `` I've kind of assumed the Observers have been here for a long time, `` he said, `` so when I first heard of the show I did wonder how they could fit the story in so elegantly. ``\n\nBut viewers are far from seeing everything, and the two are still learning.\n\nThe Observers are still unknown, but they play a significant role in \"Eureka,'' even if only through their motives. One member even calls himself the Creator. The last words of the first episode revealed that the aliens have been to Earth for centuries : \" A very long time ago, a great race of super-beings created the galaxy out of chaos. They also shaped us into our current form. They are powerful -- powerful in their numbers, in their knowledge, in what they know about us. They also have an incredible sense of purpose, a sense of justice and love, or so they have told us. \"\n\nBut in the pilot episode, the aliens are still quite mysterious. How did they start?

{"id":1292,"ended":true,"length":352,"text":"On July 18, 2013, House of Cards ( along with Netflix's other web series'Arrested Development and Hemlock Grove ) earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online only content. The show received six nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series and three nods for best lead actor : Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright, and Frank Underwood Jr. The third nomination was for best supporting actor : John Carroll Lynch ( aka Mr. President ), who had never previously been nominated for outstanding lead drama actor for his work in other roles.\n\nThis nomination set a precedent as the largest number of nominations ever by an actor in one series. That means Spacey has tied two actors who also received three nomination for the same series.\n\nSpacey had previously won three consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards as guest actor in 2001, 2005, and 2006. The other actors previously with three nominations in acting categories were actor Jonathan Pryce ( HBO's Game of Thrones, 2001, 2003, 2004 ), actor Michael Weatherly ( Fox's NCIS: LA, 2006, 2007, 2009 ), and actress Lena Dunham ( HBO's Girls, 2013 ).\n\nHowever, Spacey has only won one acting Emmy and it was in the same year he was the guest actor in a drama series : 1998 for Murder by the Book. His other acting wins were as producer for the Netflix production House of Cards : Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (2014), Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (2013), and Outstanding Sound Editing for a Drama Series (2013). Spacey also won best writing for a drama series for the film American Beauty and Best Director (2005), and the 2005 Critics' Choice Television Award for outstanding actor in a motion picture for the film American Beauty, and the 2007 Annie Award for outstanding children's acting for the movie House of Cards.","token_len":372,"entropy":[7.612,3.4203,0.2834,3.1986,0.2273,7.2062,3.0632,3.9336,4.358,12.8159,0.0368,4.9546,2.2186,4.7099,7.9493,0.3557,8.1998,9.056,1.5463,0.0166,0.027,2.7031,11.438,0.1066,0.0017,1.2771,7.1497,3.4254,3.8488,9.0352,0.0053,0.016,1.0602,5.0673,0.7102,5.7709,11.6285,11.1421,4.5801,1.4297,1.611,1.3844,3.411,4.6995,0.3015,1.6225,0.6442,4.6013,0.0019,3.0373,0.5131,2.287,4.1589,3.3702,0.688,4.3629,7.0256,0.7145,11.3235,5.2731,0.1333,0.0004,1.0763,6.6882,0.1033,0.4054,1.4751,5.8891,1.6386,0.0024,6.104,0.1702,2.2697,6.2654,1.415,0.7737,0.883,2.7947,2.1167,0.1722,2.1771,4.2247,7.5332,8.0486,3.0918,10.7716,5.4057,0.1209,6.2976,2.1944,1.737,4.0327,5.699,4.5195,1.6114,0.1132,0.4276,8.8368,4.3311,8.3542,7.8547,3.9632,2.4137,2.3766,1.1332,5.1856,5.2182,0.6778,2.0196,0.0181,5.2632,4.8769,6.1399,1.3679,3.204,4.7826,2.1623,6.8317,4.5566,0.0485,0.913,2.1569,3.8141,1.5061,4.7779,1.3948,4.3073,4.2129,1.552,4.7387,3.6662,9.6516,0.0041,3.5298,7.3856,5.026,4.9398,2.7583,4.8361,2.098,4.92,3.3961,5.0676,3.4395,1.5089,1.8671,1.5631,1.1361,0.0002,5.0747,0.002,3.9135,2.4126,1.5968,2.8436,4.0382,1.6536,0.0002,0.0768,0.478,4.0782,6.4298,2.5313,1.9405,6.9648,1.9946,2.8833,0.2181,0.7213,2.0887,0.8247,2.7292,3.7582,4.2926,7.98,5.7725,1.6776,0.4637,2.2641,10.5713,2.5416,0.9598,5.1826,5.5642,4.0944,0.0339,1.0739,6.7818,0.342,3.9846,0.0949,0.0043,3.5192,5.0256,2.3996,3.1093,1.1212,1.5125,4.673,2.0914,3.4548,7.9532,0.1976,0.0476,4.9672,0.1064,5.6251,0.0002,0.7104,2.7595,2.8419,2.5099,1.3561,0.8358,1.349,1.2874,2.0187,0.8174,2.9357,6.1655,2.494,0.0745,2.3631,0.0266,1.9174,0.7465,3.1809,1.9414,0.4436,0.0002,5.9099,0.0341,1.4505,0.0039,2.6358,3.5614,1.5993,1.0953,6.9238,1.6971,4.2447,5.4695,0.4732,2.2784,2.8362,3.0722,1.0045,2.4484,2.0462,4.1648,3.3185,1.2837,1.2144,2.5302,4.0568,1.4461,6.8344,5.9741,6.1203,6.6455,3.7746,1.5989,3.2444,1.8836,4.2263,2.605,3.6026,2.7943,1.1304,3.3479,5.4855,2.7185,2.4218,5.4988,6.3309,5.1074,0.1807,0.0255,3.7215,6.0405,0.0094,4.3696,1.175,0.5528,0.9206,0.0393,2.3427,6.012,0.7508,4.2354,0.0001,3.8645,0.0483,0.3586,0.0679,0.6753,0.0179,0.0717,2.4827,0.2013,0.8698,0.1945,0.0,4.3977,0.5409,0.3568,0.0378,0.1464,0.0032,0.0254,2.0168,0.1951,2.9581,0.0041,1.2824,0.6191,4.6636,3.686,0.4126,0.6232,1.501,0.3435,1.3338,2.1736,4.659,5.5799,3.1057,3.1376,6.2111,3.038,2.1527,4.8068,1.6246,2.1304,3.6516,7.2978,7.2399,0.6888,0.0426,6.0543,0.7208,0.4581,4.7277,5.4109,2.0057,0.5535,5.7637,0.0295,2.4246,0.8674,1.4705,2.9078,0.3271,3.4512,2.6041,2.0018,3.1098,6.9122,0.9426,0.1396,0.9475,8.9281,0.0285,5.7132,1.011,0.8786,2.7116,6.0185,0.0887,0.0136,0.8605]}
{"id":115,"ended":true,"length":318,"text":"Following repairs in July 1916, Markgraf went into the Baltic for trials. The ship was then temporarily assigned to the I Scouting Group for the fleet operation on 18 \u2013 19 August. On 12 \u2013 13 September, Markgraf went through heavy anti-aircraft fire during the landing of troops on the Western Front while screening two destroyers. On 28 \u2013 29 September, she accompanied the German cruiser Prinz Eugen on her return to port.\n\nMarkgraf came back to Kiel for exercises and repairs in October and January 1917, and joined the battleship class during the British naval offensive and the Battle of Jutland in May 1917. During the Battle of Jutland, Markgraf had to deal with the British fleet as she cruised and screened the light forces as they attacked the British fleet. In the battle, Markgraf was hit several times by torpedo boat attacks, but managed to escape unscathed.\n\nAfter the battle, Markgraf returned to the Baltic for anti-aircraft gunnery exercises. Once the British started their attacks on Germany during the Battle of the Somme, Markgraf was again deployed to British waters and joined the British fleet as a covering force for minesweepers and destroyers. She also escorted the battleship  when she searched for the battlecruiser  which had been sighted drifting under tow in the English Channel.\n\nThe ship then sailed for the Mediterranean for another major fleet operation on 15 July and arrived home on 28 July. While in the Mediterranean, Markgraf also escorted the battlecruiser  as she departed to join the British forces in the Far East during the Japanese campaign in October. After having been repaired from battle damage again at the end of the year, the ship was assigned to the I Scouting Group once again on 22 September 1918.","token_len":372,"entropy":[11.4617,3.4417,3.7537,9.7731,0.2911,8.4414,9.5705,2.5397,5.0819,2.3245,2.3158,8.0845,4.2302,6.7399,1.7526,2.5829,3.7136,1.0554,3.739,7.3095,4.9092,0.1051,0.8755,6.2613,16.5429,3.4435,3.7016,1.457,8.9001,6.4125,3.8128,5.3704,10.7028,1.9349,1.1256,0.9335,3.5484,4.5233,3.3151,0.5277,0.9357,0.8381,1.3918,0.0064,0.0002,3.2464,4.2391,4.7229,5.8748,0.0306,0.7275,0.0843,0.3844,4.0606,1.37,5.5344,0.9669,8.4411,1.5281,0.5747,6.0297,1.2529,6.6165,10.1972,5.9995,6.5886,0.0004,1.2221,2.6052,4.7661,2.0763,0.0686,0.3223,0.211,5.085,8.8539,0.9942,3.9445,3.892,6.7707,0.1896,0.7635,0.0989,4.6037,2.7989,4.5919,0.4941,3.8662,0.8926,1.6716,0.0025,2.7126,0.0144,0.0002,5.8507,1.8959,0.809,4.8671,2.018,3.4233,7.045,2.0982,3.8926,2.1121,2.3893,2.6993,3.8103,0.4585,1.8306,1.6146,5.1183,0.3836,6.3933,0.3649,7.2922,3.5695,0.3882,6.6056,5.1931,3.7986,4.6736,2.4505,3.0683,0.0095,6.0846,0.268,0.0023,1.7126,2.7553,1.9418,0.1105,3.0703,0.8705,2.6077,0.0162,3.5352,0.0114,0.0017,0.4812,1.459,0.0032,0.0003,3.9802,2.2155,4.6684,0.0181,2.0502,3.8985,4.3673,3.7563,3.3237,6.1888,0.003,5.3528,9.2315,2.3319,7.0552,5.7434,4.8022,1.422,3.7103,1.1794,3.4306,3.5692,0.7247,2.7306,1.9609,2.9589,2.0486,1.7199,0.0029,0.0003,1.4569,2.6576,5.2508,0.0063,1.0744,4.7202,6.1747,4.5068,1.5284,1.439,1.833,0.0175,2.2341,2.2251,0.0001,0.3115,1.0354,0.0002,3.4042,1.1064,2.053,0.56,0.5911,0.0036,0.0003,2.0816,0.0937,1.9299,1.6777,1.9079,7.3123,0.0087,0.5734,0.0016,4.1787,0.305,2.4779,1.5444,6.28,3.2151,4.1512,5.5442,2.4093,4.9911,0.6183,4.4448,4.6692,0.266,1.8168,0.013,2.444,1.491,0.0001,0.4075,1.0316,0.0023,0.0004,1.6607,4.257,4.1563,0.7316,7.723,2.9835,2.5502,4.5857,0.337,4.4582,2.6844,1.959,1.3892,10.1318,2.1727,2.4875,6.9776,1.2256,0.1694,0.0067,1.9258,2.9017,0.0004,0.439,2.2266,2.248,6.4397,0.6361,3.0888,0.0403,9.0126,14.1912,1.1207,7.2149,0.3741,2.826,5.9068,3.6244,0.9224,4.0043,5.2126,1.0145,1.1816,6.1533,0.0007,7.1032,5.1076,8.995,2.6102,0.647,4.9408,0.1213,0.4247,0.7172,0.0002,2.8217,3.42,3.8087,2.2311,1.8689,1.6315,4.0995,3.5163,4.6645,5.2669,7.0526,0.5075,2.073,3.1317,3.359,2.7575,3.772,6.3625,1.058,3.899,1.185,0.6735,4.7088,2.128,0.8665,0.9088,0.2559,0.6618,0.0022,0.0005,4.4725,5.0407,0.5034,3.1416,0.4217,0.0591,0.2857,2.7807,1.3605,6.4807,3.2851,3.339,0.3168,2.6998,3.1393,1.379,0.965,5.9529,0.0639,3.6161,0.2493,6.5896,3.6234,1.6273,3.8489,1.3292,3.5334,6.1779,2.2398,5.5965,4.4914,5.7645,2.0417,6.9861,3.7669,1.2377,1.3957,0.0015,1.2745,2.2486,0.1265,1.5505,1.4842,1.4292,3.1411,0.1414,0.2571,2.739,0.8927,0.056,7.4712,0.419,2.2353,3.1729,3.0681,2.8208,0.371]}

It moved westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean early on September 23. Cloudiness became more widespread as the system organized and turned south. The first two models to estimate hurricane winds turned the disturbance off the coast, while the third two models predicted that the system would turn north.\n\nIn spite of the disagreement regarding the future path of this disturbance, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the system to Tropical Depression Three-Eearly on September 24.\n\nAt 1000 UTC (6 a. m. EDT and 6 p. m. local time) on September 24, the center of Tropical Depression Three-Eearly had moved into central Mexico. Rainfall from the system and enhanced easterly wind shear caused steady weakening. The depression was officially designated as Tropical Depression Three-Eearly at 1200 UTC (5 a. m. EDT and 5 p. m. local time) on September 24.\n\nThe depression was centered near 14.4 North latitude and 120.4 West longitude, about 245 miles ( 395 km) southwest of Zihuatanejo or about 265 miles (435 km) east-northeast of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.\n\nMaximum sustained winds were near 35 mph ( 55 km\/h) with higher gusts.\n\nA turn toward the north-northwest is forecast tonight or Saturday, with a minimum central pressure near 898 millibars.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure based on this forecast is near 856 millibars.\n\nTropical Depression Three-Eearly could produce total rain accumulations of 3 inches to 6 inches near its center.

{"id":3195,"ended":false,"length":345,"text":"In the early 1980s, there were four notable Christian heavy metal groups : Messiah Prophet, Leviticus, Saint, and Stryper. Although it is debatable as to which band was formed first, the final result is the one that appears on record first : Saint.\n\nThe story begins in 1981. It all started while a Christian vocalist named Michael Lark (who died in an automobile accident in 2010 ) was involved in a drug related incident. He lost his arm and lost the ability to sing for a while, and that inspired his brother Jerry Lark (who is the one who is playing bass and drum on Saint's debut album \" In the Spirit of Things \") to begin performing as Saint (although he later switched to playing only drums).\n\nJerry was a fairly successful Christian pop\/rock singer, and he recruited some members from his previous group to form a new rock supergroup called Saint : Jerry Lark on vocals and bass, Mike Lark on guitar, John Heyden and Doug Krenzer on guitars both of whom also would play in Messiah Prophet later, and Steve \"Mudskipper\" Mullen on drums.\n\nWith a new name (and a new band and new members ) the group (Saint ) recorded their first demo. There is speculation that one of Mike Lark's friends was actually in Messiah Prophet at the time (there are also rumors that Jerry Lark was in Messiah Prophet, but there is not any proof of that being so ), because when they recorded this demo, Mike Lark came up with the name Saint which would turn out to be their official name on their first album. When their demo was released in 1982 by the band Solid State, they would later be signed by Solid State as well and the first song on the Solid State releases would be titled \" Saint \"!","token_len":373,"entropy":[2.6222,4.0638,2.4425,0.0829,0.2039,4.5088,0.8091,4.4067,7.1161,8.1825,8.1861,1.779,3.3866,8.333,9.3022,9.6342,0.6726,9.0612,1.0872,0.0002,1.5426,6.4737,4.2287,0.8297,4.4185,3.975,3.7329,0.2392,4.9877,4.0904,2.0038,6.4639,0.0039,2.4724,0.0131,2.7378,3.6287,1.597,6.8454,3.8144,0.2427,1.557,6.6828,4.3017,1.1092,3.6804,4.1439,1.1996,6.1485,2.6149,4.2946,6.2146,6.9838,3.8058,1.6879,2.0115,0.572,1.7787,5.4932,2.4069,1.2074,4.1398,2.4934,4.017,4.8216,0.8033,5.1903,2.3467,5.0574,8.7499,0.0381,1.985,4.5746,4.7877,4.8121,4.059,2.5983,4.3163,0.4845,5.3597,0.8075,0.0709,1.1744,5.4781,5.3657,0.4116,6.5823,0.0803,0.421,6.5769,4.7347,2.2486,0.8356,2.4391,5.1886,0.6698,4.8056,1.2329,4.1317,3.0086,1.3198,0.014,2.2152,4.4769,1.6104,1.6157,1.6067,1.6643,4.7169,8.2172,2.2589,3.7128,6.5666,3.2652,0.0347,1.5118,1.0156,3.2556,3.9601,4.6769,0.6874,4.1415,4.9084,3.4164,2.6685,4.8003,2.9048,3.6325,1.0859,3.668,0.2732,4.5838,6.5857,1.4871,5.4075,0.7091,7.2588,1.5495,2.2936,0.0696,4.9634,4.5176,3.5624,4.813,4.2991,4.3274,1.4864,4.2699,3.427,0.5621,3.0321,6.0804,1.9315,1.2185,1.8068,0.0003,5.7123,2.8429,2.6128,5.7603,3.3299,4.7783,6.5962,5.0635,0.4633,1.7216,1.3659,1.424,2.0788,6.001,3.1173,3.7893,1.6852,1.9317,4.172,1.4249,3.2244,3.3102,2.1866,1.358,6.5996,8.8757,0.0973,0.7565,3.1906,5.8007,6.7768,2.0823,0.022,5.4666,3.655,1.5499,2.846,2.0878,5.2023,2.3587,0.0239,0.3588,1.2713,0.6832,4.4723,6.3834,6.3572,2.8813,5.8452,4.7195,6.337,4.2871,0.2692,4.8128,9.2609,3.0139,1.1046,3.5611,6.6674,1.9439,3.219,7.2376,0.0691,7.9777,3.4483,0.5186,4.7855,5.4155,4.2222,4.9717,7.6883,3.7202,0.0647,6.2599,1.2416,0.825,0.6604,0.6228,1.4449,0.0002,4.8517,2.8916,2.6299,4.2012,3.5314,3.2777,1.6357,1.0246,2.2478,5.5733,2.4265,4.3363,3.8871,2.2847,0.9711,5.732,5.4702,2.6399,6.7607,1.6899,0.5046,5.2658,4.0594,4.6406,2.793,4.8581,0.2436,4.9183,0.4884,5.295,1.2518,0.0044,0.0614,3.8363,2.5324,3.8863,3.4799,7.6649,0.013,2.9374,0.472,0.0549,2.8118,4.6371,1.8796,2.3196,0.9324,0.3375,3.8923,2.1933,0.0044,1.4073,2.5658,3.8366,0.023,3.8267,1.177,2.8326,0.4842,3.3213,2.9319,2.5188,2.5326,1.0034,4.4908,4.7361,5.7742,6.4863,4.0299,2.3081,2.4561,4.4521,0.4539,0.9867,2.4046,0.8795,0.0024,5.8676,1.6357,0.1331,0.7458,1.2727,3.475,4.3247,3.4156,5.4975,0.4125,0.0238,0.1022,6.2451,4.7003,0.5317,4.445,2.227,2.3707,1.0019,1.1964,4.4697,3.9728,4.3384,0.8272,0.7942,2.0939,2.8874,5.3183,2.5445,1.9726,7.6698,3.583,1.0891,1.3355,4.2214,3.6576,3.0824,4.7825,1.2619,6.2535,0.0529,2.8347,2.2041,3.8323,3.5786,3.4666,3.8572,0.9898,1.3063,6.7499,0.0399,7.1519,4.2156,0.2548,2.8324,0.3746,4.4734,1.5458,7.3213]}

After giving a passionate speech before the Parliament of Norway ( the Storting ), Nansen was convinced that the expedition was worth the costs. The first two legs to Greenland and Canada, the voyage of the Fram, and the third leg from New York to Rindos, from which only fifty of the original four hundred and fifty-six persons were rescued, cost the Nansen expedition NOK 521, 000, and the return from Rindos and the rescue of the remaining one hundred and thirty-five, NOK 524, 000. In total, only two ships were used for the expedition. One had carried Nansen himself on his earlier expedition in 1893 and was used for the Greenland leg to Rindos. The other was one of his ships previously used as a supply vessel. The Fram was a \"sturdy old freighter that had worked her way up the river Danube by steam and sails in the service of both the British and Russian Empires.\" Built in Stockholm, she was given the name Fram by Nansen, in honor of his own, Fram. A small whaler, the Reine, was used for the first leg, from Copenhagen to Greenland, which reached the island in September 1875. The Fram was equipped with two sets of engines and a large crew\u2014all were originally intended for the Greenland leg, although the use of the Reine was not mentioned in the original plan until after the journey had set sail. All the crew for the expedition were trained in winter navigation and the Fram was completely self-sufficient both for the journey and during a stopover by the Reine near Iceland to replenish the ship's provisions. The expedition's ship was the Reine, while Fram was used only for supply vessels.","token_len":373,"entropy":[11.3498,2.301,6.1357,6.5386,2.5447,1.1413,3.8859,2.3608,0.281,1.3917,6.9822,0.9824,12.5901,2.4287,6.2073,11.7158,7.5629,7.5618,8.4408,3.0389,5.3654,6.594,2.7872,10.6366,3.5514,4.7003,0.5426,6.6053,2.9346,2.5628,3.8358,8.7375,7.7598,5.7915,4.8642,5.0595,0.1022,3.3209,6.1382,0.3328,1.0413,2.6999,1.6301,1.821,1.9648,3.8747,1.232,2.6188,3.8995,4.119,7.1876,5.815,4.1592,3.9275,4.7485,2.8912,2.0307,6.3944,3.6754,1.2503,13.1922,4.2135,2.4121,0.5047,4.5094,1.326,3.9878,3.8961,2.1178,0.855,6.8463,5.704,8.5935,1.5029,6.2428,2.2074,5.8444,7.5516,4.2916,0.3431,3.3466,5.3462,3.5321,2.9769,1.4316,2.0654,1.9308,4.2164,1.1255,4.2118,0.7595,3.616,2.5805,5.8655,0.0888,4.1702,3.5239,0.0108,4.0931,4.593,1.1051,5.3099,2.2195,1.9131,1.7137,6.6013,4.3642,1.5347,0.0015,0.0046,4.2176,1.6868,6.3471,0.6703,1.2731,3.0611,5.1496,0.7506,0.1331,3.4931,0.5689,1.8417,3.2972,4.8699,0.0065,1.8086,3.6477,0.4629,0.3701,0.3911,3.0661,4.6505,0.3872,5.6053,3.1116,4.3843,1.4011,3.1566,2.0337,0.3945,0.6347,1.1447,4.3256,4.9058,6.9388,3.7995,0.016,5.4345,3.4903,3.4242,7.6205,2.0517,2.9835,6.1228,1.937,2.4169,3.3696,1.7181,0.9598,6.579,6.4954,4.0934,3.0761,0.0031,0.0058,1.069,1.0006,0.8973,1.7723,5.9562,0.8307,3.8439,3.2279,9.751,0.4908,2.4356,0.4359,6.6296,1.7761,1.9222,1.4178,4.8849,1.7054,2.7663,5.9214,5.1787,4.3454,6.1827,6.2727,0.0236,4.6215,1.7899,6.8067,4.9673,0.3799,1.38,1.1918,4.6275,7.8857,0.2714,4.2504,4.4367,2.2332,6.2522,3.4188,1.1236,6.4901,0.0253,5.8658,1.3638,2.7905,0.3409,5.0671,5.4506,1.5969,6.9605,0.9137,9.1918,0.9906,6.3507,0.6953,5.8805,1.5728,1.001,4.5284,3.7695,3.3773,0.0648,1.9615,3.8975,1.4837,0.0042,1.7438,6.0046,6.2513,11.806,2.1476,3.7474,4.0057,7.6614,1.3867,1.8564,1.3348,8.0249,4.1257,1.1922,1.0712,1.764,1.7742,0.5761,2.9331,1.1077,2.3752,4.7316,4.4034,0.3862,4.4277,1.4029,3.4012,5.3909,1.9218,4.4202,2.7152,4.2785,1.8144,4.272,0.3844,1.3396,3.5273,0.9951,4.5395,0.0775,2.377,5.6654,0.0042,3.9519,1.7375,1.7801,3.8609,3.9982,7.6522,4.2419,5.2173,6.1285,4.1059,0.952,0.8882,4.1738,0.5435,1.7947,4.2151,1.6477,6.3331,0.0736,1.5055,2.1731,0.0037,1.3257,3.2123,4.9717,1.5135,0.4576,1.7718,2.289,4.0422,2.5165,0.5269,6.0185,2.5422,8.4656,0.8137,0.4105,5.0241,1.6684,1.7619,6.1599,0.239,1.0981,0.9679,4.9535,1.6237,8.1515,4.3659,1.1816,3.6868,3.62,0.9487,7.1928,4.1079,0.0359,0.3339,7.3537,2.8921,2.1956,2.9128,0.3947,3.2656,5.0595,7.5018,1.7295,5.3823,0.8867,4.0401,0.0063,6.5625,5.4685,4.553,7.7504,0.001,1.1301,2.0865,1.403,4.268,0.2757,1.1533,3.9339,3.1614,4.8877,1.4094,2.7846,2.5897,0.0109,1.0165,5.7959,8.5937,0.5847,3.1516,3.9725,0.4874,7.8262,3.7097,0.804]}

It can hear insects and small vertebrates with great ease, such as birds and frogs.","token_len":373,"entropy":[11.0659,2.184,12.0503,10.439,7.9798,3.598,6.8053,1.3747,4.9069,2.8467,14.2176,6.5994,12.2463,5.0298,5.5441,0.306,2.7951,7.3295,8.9434,1.4907,7.2889,5.3992,5.5494,3.2892,2.9635,5.6832,1.3856,1.8456,3.404,7.9257,3.1565,2.2028,3.4307,0.9158,1.1659,2.4524,3.236,4.0859,0.2111,5.5819,1.9738,5.6583,2.8099,1.2409,7.0687,1.1246,0.6048,1.4599,2.2902,3.5141,5.3383,1.8206,2.917,0.1949,0.3609,0.9018,1.0154,8.0368,7.5928,5.2564,9.5349,5.7725,3.0606,3.2958,3.7277,4.7522,2.4436,1.8867,5.5896,1.0308,2.2812,4.7293,1.802,0.0488,1.6408,2.612,2.2893,11.5396,1.7952,2.9011,1.3019,3.2618,3.3248,1.1031,0.6331,1.962,0.3126,5.2187,4.119,0.8102,0.9436,5.7744,4.9404,8.1324,2.0273,4.0652,2.3041,5.7837,4.7351,2.8868,3.181,2.0049,1.4911,1.9589,0.7387,5.2114,2.4501,2.4988,6.3884,4.4408,6.1756,0.8506,4.3358,2.2536,4.1318,3.1949,4.3482,1.779,1.9364,0.4423,3.9457,0.2787,4.9201,1.1433,6.4177,0.7333,2.9622,1.1334,2.7423,0.2497,1.6014,0.124,2.4134,0.1016,5.6251,0.1078,0.3165,5.2335,5.2902,6.456,0.1366,0.9207,4.8832,0.0012,3.1291,9.9448,0.2342,2.296,3.1579,2.6411,1.5201,2.4449,0.7067,5.2089,0.4027,1.033,3.9682,3.746,6.1622,3.7375,2.3891,0.7568,2.4946,7.1144,0.998,5.3933,2.3011,2.3547,7.4259,0.8367,1.1982,2.2092,1.3149,1.3595,2.8034,0.1106,0.8903,0.917,1.7809,0.1281,0.3536,3.2219,0.3492,3.1597,0.4339,0.4098,0.4063,0.627,1.0029,2.2973,0.072,3.036,0.7932,0.2825,0.2909,3.5565,1.3221,7.4553,0.0366,0.0061,2.1014,1.5403,2.0189,1.99,5.1768,1.4623,4.5195,2.7544,6.1697,3.7924,3.1427,0.0033,0.0436,0.1574,0.1727,1.9238,0.5494,0.0007,0.0004,0.3806,4.7681,0.3272,0.5069,0.6783,1.8554,1.0519,3.0636,4.7291,4.3089,2.2883,0.199,2.472,4.8821,1.6764,6.0022,6.4736,4.628,1.9052,0.9581,0.001,0.0009,0.3675,2.231,3.797,5.9915,1.6606,0.1963,0.2959,0.6737,0.6489,4.0823,1.2059,0.5563,1.9456,6.0061,2.4125,5.9687,2.3012,1.9964,3.7995,6.9699,0.4761,6.1236,2.0461,6.7905,1.1282,0.508,5.6925,1.4857,1.2014,1.6879,3.1885,0.2332,2.8386,6.6638,0.0739,0.2891,5.3166,0.4271,7.1092,1.0634,5.4637,4.6081,0.0433,0.5564,5.8656,8.1426,0.068,1.4457,2.4211,1.2218,4.6459,3.123,2.9792,3.5143,2.25,0.5446,0.1439,0.5442,1.4301,0.5274,3.7181,7.0906,2.8449,5.3305,5.1071,3.7357,1.5173,0.0007,0.0013,1.1062,2.6427,5.0388,6.7464,8.4978,6.4957,6.7298,4.7906,6.1441,1.2169,4.7835,0.4021,1.0048,1.4117,0.6612,1.9179,0.0003,6.3681,2.0724,5.8954,0.0105,0.3076,8.4813,9.2817,3.2104,0.1736,4.6414,7.4838,2.422,0.2884,5.4164,0.0024,0.1222,6.8316,9.1843,2.5353,2.0597,0.1052,0.0082,2.3473,8.0952,4.5962,5.2975,1.7154,2.1036,1.5499,1.4429,6.6234,1.683,3.896,5.0471,0.1245,4.0212,3.2459,5.479,1.3755,4.1832,0.0024,3.1594,1.2401,4.2593,0.5991]}

He appears to have been a descendant or relative of the famous war chief < unk'wans>, who was allied with the Iroquois and was one of the most important chiefs of the Senecas until he was captured and probably murdered by the British. He is first mentioned in 1665 when a contingent of Seneca warriors joined the Iroquois League and attacked the colonists.[21] Andaigweos was among the group of chief informants who led the Iroquois to the Seneca village in 1675. That fall, the Indians attacked two settlements. Andaigweos led the attack on the settlement that had earlier sheltered them.[23][24] Andaigweos was among the Seneca leaders who were at the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1779. He fought a British expeditionary force that was attacking Fort Duquesne in western Pennsylvania.[8]\n\nAndaigweos is a candidate for the last surviving leader of the Iroquois Confederacy. His father was a warrior with the Tuscarora and, according to some sources, was named \"Hoban\". He is identified as a son of the last Seneca war chief; however, this is supported by some but not all sources.[22] He died sometime between 1760 and 1768.\n\nAfter the death of the last survivor Chief Oswego (Oyster Bay) in 1794, Andaigweos' son, Andaigweos (Oyster Bay), became the last chief of the Seneca Nation (Seneca County).[22] Andaigweos' son, Hiawatha (Long Island), was a leader of the Six Nation Confederacy (New York State).","token_len":374,"entropy":[10.806,5.3095,2.8995,1.8959,4.764,0.0656,11.9894,2.4691,7.1847,1.1812,1.4431,5.3768,3.9645,1.1244,1.0398,4.469,11.1726,5.5672,10.1925,5.4147,8.132,1.3472,4.0766,5.1223,0.5833,0.5492,0.9744,2.0786,4.6534,6.2954,4.9341,0.1054,1.3952,4.7021,7.4891,4.6289,11.7064,11.3607,5.9474,7.6388,5.8046,6.9747,4.4495,1.3237,1.4507,6.7711,0.3736,0.6976,5.0848,0.0014,0.0014,2.3642,1.9691,3.9745,0.0144,0.2678,2.4265,2.3108,1.6036,0.6388,0.4816,7.5004,4.5789,0.008,5.4245,2.1784,0.8275,2.2057,2.0607,8.0084,3.3534,0.7424,0.8296,4.3992,1.2205,2.4904,2.0281,8.4113,0.8133,0.4641,5.0712,5.0514,3.3117,2.3789,8.9681,0.1134,5.5803,1.3671,2.0704,5.9864,1.2471,1.5997,0.0006,0.0058,9.7471,1.6897,3.3822,1.0382,8.2955,6.2545,4.7838,0.0683,5.7921,0.1526,0.0026,0.0101,0.0153,1.4573,5.5075,0.2792,6.0222,0.5268,6.2105,10.5319,1.4894,3.8153,0.5643,2.4882,0.0012,0.005,1.1241,1.5956,5.5125,1.0641,5.1098,3.0865,1.8658,3.3364,1.0085,5.8217,6.9374,0.4399,1.5802,3.952,3.4505,6.2721,4.7886,4.1202,4.0987,0.1051,0.0017,0.0032,0.0043,4.1527,0.8938,2.5315,1.0135,0.6576,3.278,4.0271,3.1074,6.5085,7.7066,4.2216,2.8364,3.7598,3.2399,0.1472,0.15,3.9095,0.1197,0.0022,0.0025,0.0036,1.3038,4.2763,0.2635,5.0701,0.2772,3.8452,0.4619,2.7705,5.1247,1.1875,3.9285,0.0428,7.3203,3.3457,1.0588,2.2527,4.9486,1.1782,1.3039,4.4865,3.3958,7.6276,2.9365,5.4169,0.6649,2.1592,2.1232,5.1587,2.958,5.8472,0.6455,0.0048,0.9889,6.3895,3.087,2.8415,7.1219,0.1932,1.3477,0.0003,3.5003,0.0359,0.0048,0.0037,0.0062,2.6948,2.909,7.5769,0.3193,0.7412,6.4418,4.797,4.5568,0.1359,0.117,0.956,0.0015,0.0023,2.7641,1.189,2.9681,3.0354,1.1829,1.5555,4.4543,4.2943,0.9988,5.1433,0.4218,0.1854,2.9442,5.212,2.956,0.0007,3.2742,1.8747,0.0445,1.164,3.8608,3.3864,4.2132,4.6588,4.885,4.4184,1.5458,2.09,5.2653,1.2378,1.5415,3.8515,0.1478,1.417,5.3387,4.1146,0.0567,4.6231,0.0956,6.5313,3.9246,0.0429,2.9443,1.5765,6.6783,0.0495,3.1508,8.2331,0.3958,0.304,1.5957,1.7382,4.4621,0.2236,2.363,3.7314,5.2191,1.4685,1.5674,3.7507,0.0633,0.1682,3.6034,1.5356,1.203,0.0001,5.74,1.3647,2.4817,0.0308,3.6729,1.9264,5.5338,9.9449,6.4814,4.2395,0.3693,3.5092,5.8233,5.5853,3.7282,4.8405,1.2451,2.6908,0.4215,4.3431,0.2781,2.4758,0.0045,0.0038,0.0042,0.0072,3.7215,3.1239,1.8016,3.2925,0.2678,0.0342,0.0866,0.1168,3.7536,1.9603,0.2746,0.0083,0.0432,0.5064,2.3561,1.2718,1.9578,3.1405,0.638,0.1104,2.0152,0.0712,3.9857,4.1938,4.8584,0.0431,5.3357,3.6733,3.6642,0.1417,2.5095,0.0331,0.003,0.0028,0.0027,2.6174,1.3796,1.4219,5.2126,6.8095,1.0073,0.0284,0.7547,6.5173,0.9141,0.6173,0.9878,2.3014,3.6988,0.3923,0.184,8.7691,2.7447,1.7886,2.5621,4.7911,0.2643,2.7455,2.0967]}
{"id":3374,"ended":false,"length":346,"text":"Illmatic has been noted as one of the most influential hip hop albums of all time, with pundits describing it as an archetypal East Coast hip hop album. Jeff Weiss of Pitchfork writes, \"The most lasting albums define their genre. Not in a simplistic 'what kind of music are they?' but as defining what they do. And Illmatic is that shit, the definitive statement on rap.\" It was also named the 23rd best album of the 1990s by NME.\n\nThe album features a who's who of east coast rappers at this point. It marks the debuting of Nas on the major label and was later certified double platinum. On October 31, 1994, he performed the album in its entirety on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in Philadelphia and was a guest on The Late Show with David Letterman. The album is credited as sparking a resurgence of old school hip hop with many artists following the path blazed by Nas on this debut. Even in the age of MTV, and with the rap game in flux, Nas' impact would last all the way to the present day.\n\nTo date, Illmatic has spawned six official remixes or official reissue of the original. The album also spawned the single \"She\u2019s My Man\"; the B-side of which was \"No Vaseline.\" \"No Vaseline\" was written as a tribute to 2 Live Crew and is often seen as a reference to the censorship debate surrounding that group's song \" Me So Horny\". \"Me So Horny\" was chosen as the B-side to \"She's My Man\" to allow the song to be included on the album, but a record deal was not signed. The song went on to earn Nas his tenth BET Award nomination and his first win.\n\nListen to Nas\u2019 debut album Illmatic","token_len":374,"entropy":[9.915,6.7718,1.8747,7.3154,1.959,2.4334,0.0634,0.1704,1.5514,3.4308,6.4961,0.8608,5.0255,0.4975,1.0194,0.0338,1.3395,2.4264,12.1861,5.1476,0.4907,0.0286,2.917,8.4485,0.0564,0.0001,8.2153,0.1442,2.5479,0.4588,1.7227,1.1521,9.156,9.1531,2.7324,3.3171,0.0014,4.1276,1.9607,0.1803,2.2043,5.3135,8.0115,6.8588,9.7869,5.1872,3.6303,2.4652,5.364,4.9222,1.1233,7.8463,6.4752,4.8725,5.8675,0.0071,1.5772,2.3509,2.0681,3.9482,2.2933,2.9845,6.7859,3.068,2.4987,2.8364,2.2134,3.7331,10.3845,0.0001,1.5759,3.7492,7.198,2.9442,3.7714,5.9794,5.008,1.7996,5.0298,1.844,4.5699,2.6188,2.7022,5.2846,1.8586,8.4059,0.2311,1.4823,2.2026,0.2305,1.9828,3.1685,0.1084,1.3816,5.4932,0.1666,1.0251,0.7357,0.0004,2.5268,1.2664,4.3778,2.2799,10.4834,0.7518,0.0772,0.0367,8.9617,0.0885,2.2793,6.6281,4.4698,1.1769,1.2622,4.359,6.7217,0.404,3.1558,8.6654,0.1547,6.558,2.584,0.8633,6.0749,0.464,2.2823,4.2089,5.5305,6.3418,7.0087,0.1393,1.1957,4.8215,5.3772,4.1848,0.796,5.3072,0.2325,2.9058,4.0008,2.3764,1.863,2.7746,4.1717,0.0831,2.1169,3.4408,3.1672,0.0013,3.6248,0.0076,4.1966,0.1879,3.843,4.4212,3.2992,2.4623,4.5435,2.2148,0.443,2.3381,1.6253,0.5972,0.2905,0.6684,0.0001,0.0,0.3666,2.2153,1.0392,2.7699,3.7768,1.8536,9.6355,1.8015,3.2188,0.6565,6.9877,1.7355,0.9648,0.0392,3.1319,4.2558,2.9253,5.4081,2.407,3.7945,11.0589,0.1684,0.1295,1.8594,3.5818,3.3609,5.8153,0.5964,6.3803,3.6359,1.3601,5.1245,0.0229,5.0904,0.8277,5.448,2.1378,1.5353,6.5004,2.8303,2.8212,4.0767,0.2719,2.9801,3.1131,6.2751,5.5755,5.6785,4.8058,1.5896,0.0423,0.8801,1.1057,3.7396,0.6307,0.2359,0.6405,0.0002,5.8988,3.0509,0.1884,0.6777,0.0022,0.4882,4.957,4.5714,6.9531,4.6731,0.0368,6.4689,6.4115,4.4248,4.9757,3.2263,1.3341,3.4773,2.4682,1.7772,2.4871,3.1842,4.0687,2.0482,4.9385,0.36,6.6709,14.0784,9.9917,0.6345,3.4886,4.0637,4.9028,1.5443,6.9181,1.0897,0.1788,0.955,4.1326,1.2531,3.7768,5.0263,9.6844,0.3136,2.431,4.4147,3.3601,0.4326,0.0005,0.3969,1.1867,4.503,4.5603,0.6034,1.9372,0.0812,8.2281,6.9684,0.0902,2.9386,3.8268,5.644,3.1886,0.757,0.957,2.2636,0.0553,1.2717,11.5119,9.1074,1.7398,5.745,4.4257,1.0215,3.527,0.7627,12.7227,5.7395,13.4203,0.2633,5.1023,3.2986,3.6062,0.3473,0.0882,0.0006,0.1409,1.2098,7.0227,1.0668,0.8862,6.0873,0.1244,0.0187,2.8723,2.12,3.0299,2.0271,0.0715,0.0645,1.0807,4.1772,5.8001,1.7933,2.2229,0.3701,1.0811,3.5871,0.883,0.6684,1.0982,2.5341,2.2863,4.3727,5.7396,2.4644,0.6623,1.8804,2.3702,1.5778,2.2262,1.8875,5.0052,0.5719,0.0958,4.6473,3.3947,3.5044,6.5291,8.6116,3.0287,1.8509,1.9503,3.6029,1.9364,5.1058,1.9734,0.6978,0.0002,6.8841,0.2107,5.0535,8.2743,0.1324,14.488,1.2658,2.6274,0.0003]}

The sloping weir deck is composed of a series of weir chutes, which lead from the chute openings into the main canal. The water flow from the outlet chute must be turned over to enter the main canal. Once flow is turned, or reversed, water flow enters the main canal.

Five of his children followed him into circus careers : George and Arthur Norman became circus clowns while Tom, Edith and Eric were circus ringleaders.\n\nThe family home had been the \"Croydon Hippodrome\", where a small show was staged in a converted warehouse. After the first world war the circus moved to White City Stadium, west London. The White City show folded after the summer season and the name was then changed to \"Hippodrome\". During these years the circus also held a residency and annual show at Coventry Racecourse. In 1925, Norman started a new resident act featuring the Norman Sisters, who later were the Norman Sisters Orchestra. Norman managed and choreographed the act as well as directing the dancers. In its first year at Coventry the act played to packed houses every night.\n\nIn 1931 the show folded due to Norman's illness and in 1934 he leased the vacant Hippodrome in Croydon to use as a residence and as a showroom. The following year his daughters started a new resident act in his place, called the \"Hippodrome Brothers\". Norman and his family continued to run the showhouse until his death in 1930.\n\nTom Norman took over the Hippodrome Brothers circus in 1936 as well as the name.

{"id":4491,"ended":true,"length":311,"text":"Unas is well attested by historical sources with three ancient Egyptian king lists dating to the New Kingdom period mentioning him. Unas occupies the 33rd entry of the Abydos King List, which was compiled between 1750 and 1750 BCE. Although he does not appear to be an historical, the Abydos King List makes no mention of him being a mythical monarch. Several later mentions of Unas in the New Kingdom King Lists can be found in the Ramesside King List and the Memphis King List. He appears as one of the 18 kings in the Ramesside King List and one of the 27 kings and five rulers in the Memphis King List. In these lists Unas is always one of the kings of Egypt from whom the rulers of other nations had to be derived because his name is often listed on the line to them. In the Turin King List there is no mention of Unas. Most of the references to Unas in later ancient sources are made by Greek and Roman writers. He is mentioned in works of Greek authors Strabo (55 ) and Pausanias (3.31.8 ), as well as the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela (2nd century) and the Roman historian Tacitus (14.1.9-10). He is one of the kings mentioned by the Alexandrian priest Dionysius Exiguus in his 2nd century biography of Ptolemy II Philadelphus. He is also mentioned by the 3rd century church historian Eusebius, who gives the same description of Unas as found in Strabo, but does not include any of the mythological traits. His role in the cult is mentioned in Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History of the East and the History of the Church by the late 5th century writer Leo of Alexandria.","token_len":374,"entropy":[6.2924,4.3961,6.5208,7.9989,1.4186,2.825,6.7489,4.3693,5.5678,5.7482,6.8196,5.4444,7.7127,7.4699,3.6927,1.8172,1.3849,8.2782,0.5267,2.9037,11.4884,4.0859,1.9512,8.6453,0.0336,8.3013,0.7223,9.9095,0.3088,8.1024,1.2162,0.519,5.8331,3.9262,0.1433,6.1677,0.8798,1.5487,1.501,2.5973,2.1826,3.101,3.9324,2.6731,0.1895,0.6786,2.9815,4.9779,0.7896,5.0,2.6342,3.6099,0.1174,1.0633,1.3781,1.0009,2.8781,5.9464,5.5093,2.575,3.2277,0.0161,0.0018,1.2648,0.1955,6.0096,1.9505,0.3982,0.0285,1.4384,5.256,1.2234,7.0412,5.6322,0.8186,6.7938,6.4387,5.3746,0.4512,0.8834,0.0033,2.4202,0.9056,3.2779,0.0262,4.8023,3.4473,4.9571,0.0671,0.4151,0.518,1.0623,7.4499,4.983,5.5332,2.0205,0.4654,2.5944,1.2858,7.7243,0.3098,0.2581,0.7598,4.5904,2.6261,2.5733,3.2402,0.0597,0.345,6.8938,2.5798,2.198,0.3931,3.2974,0.2662,0.0342,0.354,0.1919,2.4389,4.6555,0.0701,0.1528,4.8297,1.1525,5.884,4.6645,4.3227,1.1682,0.1534,0.1387,0.0416,0.0132,0.2694,2.863,4.6518,0.7685,4.1148,0.0021,0.8924,6.6693,5.4624,0.1067,0.159,2.4718,2.6482,4.4374,5.8126,4.7917,0.9649,6.6829,1.1285,4.1476,3.1593,4.232,3.3322,2.2118,5.1953,5.9707,3.3876,1.4257,1.7734,3.1514,5.5208,2.901,0.8335,7.1981,5.459,5.977,0.3965,2.5527,1.1195,13.0858,1.9426,0.6796,0.1622,3.619,0.4043,1.3773,0.1392,0.0402,0.8249,0.0035,1.2741,5.3621,0.8474,0.2972,4.0984,0.4303,0.9927,0.0038,1.3238,7.1902,5.8408,3.1799,0.9868,4.1943,1.1745,5.0527,2.4179,1.1375,1.9849,1.1469,4.1746,0.7628,1.9964,0.9781,9.0329,1.9429,3.026,2.2495,11.0394,0.1361,2.7575,7.1933,8.4601,0.2045,4.1866,2.5978,0.0004,0.0136,0.0522,5.5195,4.0008,5.2141,1.522,3.9431,6.0182,2.7042,0.1338,0.0031,3.5857,4.7275,8.2822,0.1441,3.7437,4.7288,2.0241,0.0508,9.0213,5.6757,0.6834,2.8541,5.9086,1.1551,3.9862,0.3128,0.7596,3.1365,1.0651,1.7604,0.0005,0.1714,3.6962,1.2729,2.7142,0.1846,3.4691,1.989,2.6972,0.6173,2.8934,0.776,3.8826,0.0102,0.1732,4.3291,4.1933,2.2381,1.7735,5.8224,0.0822,6.0739,5.0649,0.0058,0.1157,8.5278,2.7295,1.9711,1.3267,1.4072,1.433,6.3424,0.1179,0.9415,4.92,1.0214,4.0554,1.7649,0.001,0.0681,3.7673,8.5949,2.5756,0.0058,0.7461,0.8294,2.0212,0.6898,1.4909,0.3943,1.7171,1.109,7.0696,0.08,0.1162,6.5598,1.4092,4.3518,0.1982,0.0009,0.0004,2.9481,1.1068,4.7502,1.6722,4.0989,2.8544,0.4832,0.4238,0.0105,1.4985,5.2123,0.192,5.9296,0.0011,1.9098,4.492,2.5444,0.0308,3.605,3.6426,2.3624,0.587,7.4674,0.1656,7.0662,2.5306,4.0179,6.2064,0.6485,0.5716,5.0316,2.9918,3.464,0.8253,4.8559,0.0632,0.0017,0.002,0.7755,6.4086,0.8401,0.3233,0.7113,0.5473,5.3532,2.8744,1.8793,4.8148,0.0189,0.7084,2.5164,3.1885,2.6896,3.5915,5.2419,0.0089,0.1565,4.8458,6.0809,3.2231,1.9792,0.6017]}

She was decommissioned on 29 October 1937 and struck from the Naval Register a year later.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\nhttp:\/\/www.navalhistory.net\/ships\/vessel\/usnpcorthos\/","token_len":374,"entropy":[5.9133,11.9527,4.4186,10.9028,6.4933,4.9358,5.4592,5.8047,10.4553,3.8009,3.5402,2.2457,8.0448,11.3848,5.6979,5.7552,3.0751,9.5353,12.8687,3.5106,12.6405,6.5892,1.7203,3.5672,4.8931,4.5456,2.5817,7.3196,7.9268,10.2482,1.7828,3.0357,7.4541,6.4469,1.8822,6.3962,1.1199,5.4349,3.2842,1.9252,6.4833,1.1551,0.6359,4.9438,6.0787,3.6277,1.2891,2.9823,1.2678,7.4666,0.2643,4.9748,4.7001,3.8608,1.0787,3.523,2.2021,0.311,2.6479,0.5684,2.1942,4.1925,3.6484,1.4335,4.7884,0.0853,4.3561,8.2598,2.2521,1.7225,4.9089,0.0324,1.122,1.3298,3.1001,2.3494,3.8261,3.9065,5.1888,1.7613,0.5905,6.1834,0.4214,1.1333,1.5987,1.6991,4.4151,1.0834,2.711,2.0357,1.7399,1.1773,6.2014,0.0688,0.0618,4.4525,3.0339,0.8171,5.4874,1.341,5.8836,5.5201,3.9456,3.0044,6.6397,0.4287,2.0293,0.8204,2.9467,2.4887,2.5441,2.1636,1.6708,1.0521,2.3863,1.0115,2.2893,0.0756,4.809,5.4999,2.448,0.0044,0.0546,0.2425,5.7721,3.7423,2.8694,0.1718,0.5734,2.2961,4.9932,1.9796,0.3833,4.3886,0.6939,0.0438,1.2603,1.4705,6.7383,1.8037,2.4342,0.8493,4.0553,3.2459,0.0122,0.2096,0.18,1.1036,0.1317,2.2355,0.0547,0.1243,1.8427,1.1699,6.6277,5.1516,4.1562,2.6221,0.8703,7.127,0.9569,3.7174,4.3175,5.6907,3.4158,4.6556,3.6705,2.6014,0.6218,6.576,2.9811,3.3279,0.8639,4.7245,1.0447,1.7075,0.0412,9.258,3.3964,0.4858,0.0523,4.4323,6.8629,1.4705,5.4112,3.146,7.5821,4.811,5.8736,0.4007,2.1736,8.7563,4.0815,1.3945,4.4467,3.355,3.5104,12.7897,2.0014,2.3548,1.3205,6.0569,6.2574,1.1612,2.05,3.4215,4.7605,2.2763,6.8241,5.1738,2.2655,1.8216,5.4414,4.891,3.7044,3.8042,2.1122,0.0693,0.0296,0.5887,1.3056,0.0375,0.0077,0.7954,1.2235,1.6194,0.5029,5.9729,5.2016,0.3407,4.3127,0.0704,5.0638,1.9724,8.2788,2.0458,0.0267,2.546,2.2123,6.0333,2.2665,0.1791,3.72,1.3965,3.2587,3.8483,1.8266,6.8985,1.442,2.197,0.5968,4.588,1.0985,5.5081,3.607,3.8255,1.5897,3.7288,1.7551,3.7249,1.5822,6.5217,2.4701,1.2105,1.3536,0.0718,0.0046,2.6058,0.6339,6.0475,0.0903,0.0175,4.9786,1.4745,7.2267,2.7155,0.1167,2.1739,5.0037,3.7564,6.429,7.6051,0.7543,4.1722,4.1316,0.0525,1.1862,4.4772,5.6099,4.9895,3.9921,1.417,4.4382,2.3407,1.2119,4.0348,0.0584,0.5252,0.9204,0.5009,3.4837,2.9961,0.4339,2.2771,1.3104,7.9313,1.9235,0.6854,4.4362,3.6701,2.1683,1.2946,0.4047,0.9547,0.5345,2.8803,0.1195,0.9999,5.7113,4.0057,4.0001,4.9677,1.0635,6.9877,5.6364,1.3257,1.8016,0.7392,4.4958,0.0004,0.0003,1.0387,3.2971,3.7333,1.4561,1.6696,8.1432,5.9093,1.0584,4.6427,6.3173,6.9001,2.3205,0.0235,0.6197,1.1562,0.0002,6.5942,1.0634,0.0005,4.7989,0.8548,18.1113,0.0004,0.6502,0.0008,2.3085,1.1011,3.2934,0.1374,3.0106,0.0814,6.4535,0.3032,8.0012,1.152,0.9381,6.2797,2.3353,9.8856,11.0232,0.1084,1.2727]}

Vig first brought the track to attention as a demo he sent to the band ; the demo was recorded at home by The Parachutes and was intended for inclusion as a B-side to ''Viva La Vida's single ''Hymn for the Weekend '', a request from the record label.\n\nEarly Coldplay discography\n\nA list of all works in alphabetical order by artist, with release dates.\n\nIn alphabetical order by year and artist.\n\nEarly releases\n\nIn chronological order or alphabetical order by date of release and artist.\n\nColdplay\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nColdplay :\n\nArtists:\n\nArtists :\n\nArtists :\n\nColdplay :\n\nArtists:\n\nArtists :\n\nArtists :\n\nArtists :\n\nArtists:\n\nArtists :\n\nArtists:\n\nArtists:\n\nArtists :","token_len":375,"entropy":[10.0215,4.896,11.5375,6.3077,1.8335,8.5736,0.2799,2.902,0.0369,0.075,4.8895,6.9589,0.61,8.929,6.3358,9.8075,2.7499,3.7422,2.1949,6.8497,9.5425,6.7418,2.3425,5.6757,0.0143,2.6618,7.8548,0.7202,6.3376,0.0017,3.9819,2.3184,0.1817,0.0306,0.7339,1.6988,2.2374,1.7081,5.0272,5.1363,0.3115,1.345,2.3196,0.2926,4.2221,0.1827,4.2413,1.4812,7.7414,0.1372,0.0294,3.3889,6.4219,6.6829,3.8119,3.1405,9.517,2.4916,5.6101,0.1461,1.4245,7.6865,2.0026,4.2317,8.7171,4.7129,9.0997,1.9308,4.0435,3.8906,4.5197,2.4016,3.7725,5.2197,4.472,0.0822,2.373,5.0693,4.9309,2.8753,5.1546,3.3085,7.8879,1.2448,6.2787,1.2752,6.3503,1.4649,6.0292,4.058,0.0155,5.0038,7.2531,2.1927,1.818,0.1987,3.1392,0.0791,4.6128,7.2069,2.2406,1.3317,3.2511,2.471,6.2867,5.2121,6.6669,2.9164,4.9916,6.286,3.8895,3.2711,4.935,0.0253,1.9935,6.7493,9.1342,6.5454,6.6772,3.778,0.6786,4.7349,0.0322,6.9996,5.3573,1.2223,4.6767,0.3673,5.1625,3.2388,0.9751,4.4353,6.8098,4.6361,0.3041,2.197,1.22,8.2903,1.7801,4.4315,1.3885,2.7999,1.8999,4.0389,2.5187,4.56,7.8627,3.1157,3.3283,2.2768,2.4246,5.689,1.9491,7.4597,4.1049,0.9154,7.1082,0.2817,0.0483,1.549,3.2589,5.5579,4.6871,2.268,1.4475,0.0573,7.1583,8.0875,1.7322,5.6783,4.0111,0.2631,1.3517,1.0035,3.9228,7.018,3.2453,2.1286,9.6749,2.5458,1.5506,5.9784,1.2566,1.3603,4.1758,2.1739,6.4959,6.3817,0.0269,7.6734,0.1332,2.004,0.0002,4.1461,5.9323,0.0781,3.1795,6.1281,3.4001,10.3375,0.0032,0.0055,1.5382,3.3779,2.5008,3.3759,6.6034,0.4508,4.0671,1.0021,0.0002,4.7004,6.3333,0.003,0.0198,1.053,4.7041,3.3819,2.8715,1.5531,0.4824,0.0002,6.1143,5.3203,1.5191,0.0002,3.4164,2.5504,0.0022,8.0878,3.8785,0.3733,0.1878,0.4786,2.2414,2.09,0.1768,4.6426,2.6815,0.2749,0.2935,0.0001,5.3868,0.0091,4.4728,0.0003,3.7497,0.0195,6.596,4.2616,0.0003,3.4589,0.0402,2.9542,1.1511,0.0002,1.3419,0.017,0.5132,0.2278,0.0002,0.3687,0.0069,0.1148,0.1103,0.0002,0.1118,0.0048,0.0482,0.0733,0.0002,0.0491,0.0041,0.1137,0.0544,0.0002,0.0282,0.0036,0.0713,0.038,0.0002,0.0189,0.0034,0.027,0.025,0.0002,0.0136,0.0032,0.0149,0.0143,0.0002,0.0104,0.003,0.0109,0.0165,0.0002,0.0083,0.0029,0.0092,0.0155,0.0002,0.0073,0.0028,0.0083,0.0127,0.0002,0.006,0.0027,0.0079,0.0113,0.0002,12.893,2.8156,3.2271,0.9277,0.0002,4.6767,0.1644,3.3104,0.243,0.0002,0.522,0.0005,0.1054,0.0548,0.0002,4.1767,0.0188,0.2997,0.0739,0.0002,2.9553,0.0004,2.4992,0.058,0.0001,2.7609,0.0002,0.3527,0.0109,0.0002,3.1292,0.0002,0.1429,0.0132,0.0002,3.208,0.0002,0.1121,0.0125,0.0002,2.7997,0.0002,2.5464,0.0512,0.0001,2.195,0.0003,0.7062,0.0093,0.0002,1.534,0.0002,1.3176,0.022,0.0001,1.3229,0.0003,0.4416,0.0208,0.0002,1.1306,0.0003,1.9842]}

{"id":1734,"ended":true,"length":318,"text":"The species can be differentiated from the similar I. cookei by its `` irregular, lumpy spores ``. It is also similar to I. < unk >, but differs in the presence of the basidia in the male galls. The basidia are small and round, sometimes obturate (the hyaline portion is slightly sunken). It has a stipe which is ashy gray to deep brownish (depending on age of specimen; the spores are brown ). The underside of the sporangium is brownish, and the top is reddish. It has numerous white to cream to white and yellowish dots. The plant is often seen growing in clusters in open forests. Sometimes it is said to grow on stumps, but it often grows in grass and in a forest understory. The cap is oblong, smooth, and shiny, ranging from light to dark brown, with a diameter of 2 to 4 cm. The underside of the cap has yellow veining. The spore-producing body in the male inflorescence is smooth, ovoid, 3.5-7.5 mm long, 2.5 to 4 mm wide, and 1 or 2 mm tall. The spore-producing body in the female inflorescence is similar, but it may contain one or several spores within it. The fruit body is shaped like a globular club or somewhat pear-shaped, with an ashy-gray to grayish surface. The flesh is pale yellowish. The flesh develops brown discolorations when bruised. The plant may be killed when cut. The fruit body develops very quickly when bruised and is often referred to as the `` quick-ripening fruit body '' by its collectors. The fruit body develops from the side wall of the galls and the spore-producing cells are on the sides of the galls.","token_len":375,"entropy":[9.0626,4.5344,1.0628,5.9165,0.8987,2.0659,6.7882,7.6203,3.4655,6.0108,8.9663,2.4564,2.6342,1.8349,13.1071,13.8628,3.0206,7.704,0.1489,9.5688,5.0387,3.0463,2.5983,1.0772,2.7429,4.5413,0.342,2.8462,0.0463,11.3751,10.8835,6.0135,6.6524,3.2815,1.1487,3.8963,0.8984,1.9891,5.6211,0.2767,3.192,9.5318,1.7816,3.9211,1.4399,5.7848,7.7712,3.7946,1.0276,1.7471,4.0849,0.1264,0.8099,4.0051,1.3058,4.9732,1.1917,4.8836,8.0582,4.8457,8.2726,3.5905,3.4184,8.2133,2.729,5.3556,1.7929,4.0658,6.8867,0.0886,1.7993,3.5412,1.6818,1.1223,5.5165,1.8293,4.5193,0.9408,6.1385,8.4183,6.1185,3.0817,6.9546,1.8982,2.4884,3.4704,6.6499,0.1302,3.5169,3.0177,3.3583,5.1044,2.4388,3.7029,0.6161,4.7777,8.7101,1.0545,6.1561,0.4654,0.2093,7.3433,5.1917,1.4787,0.6346,3.836,1.4158,2.3552,1.9131,1.1192,4.2728,1.5346,3.0439,0.0191,1.4174,2.2845,0.9586,5.8683,4.17,5.3771,6.4335,4.9347,3.4109,4.9837,3.171,2.4125,5.5396,1.2246,1.1655,7.2938,1.0493,4.2982,3.7971,2.9784,1.0889,3.1886,2.3915,4.3131,5.7885,1.5256,6.452,1.0895,0.8248,5.4637,0.4953,2.97,2.6346,5.7695,0.7649,1.739,1.8398,1.9807,4.9477,1.3586,1.1631,4.9398,3.7342,2.7503,4.6759,3.4974,4.8554,5.4846,0.3771,1.7738,6.8289,3.4475,7.5514,0.3091,1.3556,7.1349,0.6281,0.6015,5.3199,1.619,7.4623,0.4454,5.0619,1.583,0.8397,1.4174,2.4697,1.8719,1.1474,6.2795,0.2456,3.6009,1.8149,1.567,1.4735,0.6364,1.0215,4.806,1.0661,0.1388,1.4205,2.2489,4.7049,9.8181,3.974,2.3818,1.0338,3.9018,0.1484,2.7049,4.6614,5.8903,5.774,0.7177,2.6912,10.9674,0.7019,0.5372,4.3036,1.1434,7.204,0.3604,0.3788,7.7192,3.2582,0.4531,2.1429,3.5208,1.4526,0.4683,1.4224,1.1832,0.5184,4.04,0.3622,0.3977,2.5554,1.3646,1.0555,1.1319,0.265,0.4921,2.5623,6.0607,0.1634,0.7941,4.0666,0.3687,0.7427,2.2883,0.0193,0.4803,0.1946,1.548,0.9979,0.1009,0.3412,0.9071,0.0032,0.1345,5.946,2.2254,1.2222,2.4984,4.2742,4.7546,5.1771,0.3026,3.448,2.0738,6.66,1.7058,0.3561,0.9255,6.837,5.6741,0.7885,6.7962,0.5808,0.3985,5.5354,0.6435,8.6574,3.1342,8.1239,8.4896,1.3032,0.0479,1.1289,1.5808,3.4316,7.1955,0.7851,3.4793,1.3409,3.2384,4.3098,1.5077,3.2648,0.7916,0.6149,5.6016,0.8499,4.4765,1.5161,2.6656,3.285,0.6527,4.9617,7.7538,6.0658,7.3607,5.2918,0.0511,3.3365,5.2314,1.5531,0.765,3.4588,3.2585,1.1447,5.6047,3.7422,4.2185,2.7825,1.2943,4.0702,1.5709,6.0263,5.2663,2.5275,2.8903,3.0594,2.3751,2.6096,2.935,7.2912,0.0104,0.0872,1.4267,2.2194,9.9496,1.6465,8.9009,0.321,3.244,1.0121,4.7726,4.5529,2.5752,5.357,0.2359,1.0653,2.6114,0.483,4.5697,3.6659,1.372,6.1034,6.3709,0.4384,0.3479,5.5409,0.2998,1.9563,2.5534,4.1742,0.1069,0.5519,0.0843,5.4536,2.3856,5.9111,0.632,3.4163,0.9075,0.097,2.4514,0.0816,0.5698]}
{"id":3178,"ended":true,"length":317,"text":"Unsan is a town in northwest Korea, and it is located 50 mi ( 80 km ) from the Ch 'ongch 'on River mouth on the Korean west coast. Because of the hilly terrain, the town is surrounded by rolling hills. The area has a mild climate. The town has a large number of rice fields, a fact that makes it rich in agricultural products.\n\nUnsan is surrounded by four major mountain ranges \u2014 Seorak, Seongsan, Unsan and Unsan Bukgang \u2014 and many other smaller mountain ranges. These mountains make Unsan a naturally-arid area because the town receives relatively little rainfall. Unsan has a high latitude and is exposed to strong winds which cause extreme temperatures. The average temperature rarely exceeds 30 C (86 F ).\n\nThe town is famous as the birthplace of Kim Il-Sung, the founder of North Korea. It is situated on the site where Kim Il-Sung was born, and is in many ways the centre of his life and leadership activities. The hill where his birthplace lies, Ryongch'on, also has his name engraved on it. The town has a small mountain, Ryongch'on No. 5 and a memorial tower dedicated to Kim Il-Sung, as well as several memorial halls. Unsan is also the birthplace of numerous other North Korean leaders, including Kim Jong-Il, Ri Jong-Pil, Kim Yong-Chul, Jang Song-thaek and Kim Jong-Un.\n\nUnsan has an old town, but also many of the other attractions that you will find in many other North Korean tourist towns. When arriving in Unsan, try the nearby seafood restaurants near the town centre. Unsan has the reputation of being a food town, and there are restaurants offering plenty of choice for hungry tourists.","token_len":375,"entropy":[8.786,4.9011,2.1363,7.4997,2.2878,5.1705,4.8294,1.2586,2.2027,2.3959,1.2126,1.963,7.0962,5.353,2.5256,14.4254,0.1012,6.5486,1.7564,0.9282,7.4049,14.3888,8.0132,5.4254,6.5545,4.0561,5.8215,10.4093,4.4664,0.2084,2.2749,8.9182,0.0483,0.275,6.0552,0.4069,1.2521,8.4337,0.1866,0.5101,0.6725,1.8329,2.36,0.8523,4.4676,0.0613,6.5979,0.1759,1.76,1.772,3.9096,2.535,1.2886,6.7,0.7732,2.648,1.7102,2.4016,2.0783,1.0797,2.7175,1.9795,0.0027,6.7653,1.7308,1.1323,3.2834,9.4634,0.5032,2.508,0.5972,6.3094,0.2941,5.0884,1.4792,0.5588,1.3997,0.0515,6.9754,0.0124,0.7693,4.6722,0.0658,6.7869,2.5778,4.2952,0.1841,5.989,5.146,7.4547,4.537,0.4544,2.6035,3.2512,4.2615,0.379,5.2399,0.1857,1.2562,3.5644,0.3071,10.4968,8.1383,1.8045,1.5698,4.2619,2.0699,4.8469,2.0397,0.0378,0.578,3.8356,1.697,5.2497,1.8403,0.0012,1.2601,7.8746,4.1387,6.3044,0.3788,2.5212,4.6226,2.4256,4.6125,6.3144,5.4841,0.6911,0.5087,0.8031,3.4124,0.004,2.3102,1.15,2.7989,6.9424,1.9652,2.9696,6.8622,0.0743,5.1691,0.3127,4.4526,2.2529,4.7165,2.9461,1.4411,1.7893,5.3379,1.2716,10.4285,2.1561,3.2159,2.9408,1.0194,5.7214,0.0814,4.5147,1.0,0.0002,1.6982,1.2915,0.942,4.8091,3.2497,0.999,1.6344,0.0279,4.0524,0.3431,1.5872,3.2935,0.0046,0.8408,1.0456,2.2956,0.0389,2.0318,0.1488,1.1292,3.0999,0.7131,3.9878,1.1817,0.3888,6.403,4.9214,1.8945,0.4273,0.0133,0.0867,0.0097,1.6645,1.3222,1.7533,1.2364,1.3894,4.4665,5.3869,0.2049,1.1117,5.1478,0.0679,3.1789,1.913,3.3307,5.66,7.3033,0.1533,1.8615,7.1035,4.4547,3.0724,2.9547,2.658,3.0019,8.6816,1.5808,2.6114,5.5261,1.6098,1.3011,4.2612,1.741,6.5034,2.615,2.6738,0.23,0.2245,0.3843,1.8489,1.0981,2.1499,1.215,3.7959,4.7265,5.8224,3.9772,0.1042,0.3711,0.6472,0.0459,7.4694,0.1281,3.2071,4.7013,2.127,9.3507,5.5751,4.9152,0.0349,1.5989,0.0749,0.0025,0.0352,0.0078,1.9455,4.3261,0.036,0.0118,2.8414,3.5001,5.3919,1.3572,4.1918,0.0147,1.0164,0.9781,2.6071,2.1332,0.0225,6.6371,2.0531,2.5134,0.0962,1.7878,1.0345,0.5485,0.7508,0.4932,0.3754,1.8136,0.6668,5.2363,1.3196,0.0784,6.2687,2.3824,0.8888,0.7859,3.6783,0.0452,2.8493,0.9555,0.5335,5.1337,0.1166,0.3759,0.0934,1.4844,0.003,1.0119,0.8374,0.9654,0.1808,1.0109,0.1443,0.4339,0.0002,2.0064,0.0157,2.4988,3.0035,4.6732,3.8065,2.4764,5.7509,4.3869,3.6832,5.5159,0.6012,3.7051,5.8405,2.0406,3.9597,1.671,0.4963,0.7002,5.0762,2.1613,1.5765,0.1401,2.409,4.4422,0.4691,5.9647,6.9376,1.2423,1.1008,0.0009,0.3227,5.4571,3.1062,5.2029,8.246,1.5805,6.215,0.4205,1.4806,3.3624,0.8462,4.9304,0.0065,1.7255,3.6935,4.5578,0.5962,0.2129,1.1972,3.6019,4.3096,1.0651,1.4804,3.0045,0.351,4.5852,5.2491,6.2691,0.0165,6.915,2.9637,5.8087,3.2571,0.3194]}

{"id":2540,"ended":true,"length":341,"text":"When news of the attack reached California, the US War Department decided to establish a military fort at Beale's Crossing to keep the Mohave under control and secure white travelers safe passage through the desert. With the help of the US Army, Beale's Crossing was built, and a large store of food and provisions was purchased from Fort Union in Texas. Several thousand gold miners and stockmen headed to Beale's Crossing, and the town became the largest in southern Arizona. The American War Department maintained Beale's Crossing, but the Indian chief Mojave led his people to independence from the US.\n\nIn late 1864, General Philip H. Sheridan sent Colonel William Tecumseh Sherman to Mexico to prepare the way for the invasion of the country. Once General Grant took command of all American forces in 1864, he began his operations against Mexico at Vicksburg, Miss. On July 4,1865, General Sherman issued his general order No. 8, which ordered Colonel Beale's Crossing to be burned to the ground and the fort abandoned. The Indians, who had been holding white traders as prisoners, took advantage of the soldiers' departure and seized the gold they had concealed and killed most of the white men.

With the Mercedes struggling to get the power down and the Ferrari pulling away, the Ferraris celebrated victory with Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali and Vettel jumping over the barriers.","token_len":377,"entropy":[10.1897,10.8831,6.7416,1.3608,0.771,2.5063,6.2558,0.9114,2.0785,1.3379,7.2082,11.3574,9.3643,3.6056,6.5814,11.0202,3.7659,3.285,5.8305,8.8533,0.7402,9.2204,6.0497,0.2204,11.3753,1.9821,8.4581,0.0675,6.0748,2.632,5.1864,1.1551,3.249,0.6631,2.2909,5.4395,6.6379,0.006,9.2863,0.1743,0.0002,3.915,0.2878,2.9505,2.6293,6.9052,1.1468,2.1442,2.9534,11.4652,6.9287,4.7269,1.2477,0.718,2.026,1.8744,7.3418,3.0448,3.2712,0.8674,7.1435,0.8841,7.7745,2.8003,1.1553,7.2955,0.1959,4.4294,3.3918,2.1791,2.9338,0.0237,1.8161,5.8545,4.8987,6.6437,3.0688,9.7751,1.733,4.1642,2.8916,7.5485,0.955,6.2731,0.0658,0.0005,3.0227,1.0235,5.3898,3.3889,4.6925,1.2125,10.7658,4.5068,5.7076,0.0033,1.1702,4.346,0.8029,3.2388,7.0937,4.7859,3.8831,2.2958,4.1384,2.0191,2.6517,6.6594,1.5479,4.8336,1.6355,4.2898,3.2371,1.0158,0.3458,2.9097,5.9615,2.3741,2.1533,8.0657,0.7604,2.2511,2.6829,4.0864,0.4284,6.1745,1.569,3.8531,0.0046,5.2889,5.4585,4.9975,3.2609,2.5646,0.3338,0.9236,4.3413,3.9948,4.3689,4.6216,0.7098,1.8387,2.5449,8.4199,2.334,0.3821,0.9115,2.656,2.9032,2.5162,3.343,4.1952,5.88,7.3153,1.4857,0.0231,2.4061,5.9961,4.2858,1.239,3.4902,1.1734,6.1689,0.3593,0.0001,7.7117,8.2189,0.8133,4.9963,5.4376,1.4868,1.1156,0.0092,6.3069,0.349,0.2511,1.9311,4.4567,0.3652,4.8778,4.2859,8.0834,0.148,0.2754,7.4113,1.1053,7.2009,1.5218,1.2929,2.6285,5.1935,0.0549,8.0461,0.4026,3.0212,1.1304,4.2635,0.1939,4.8802,2.6851,6.4162,5.8036,2.7092,3.1155,4.9139,1.2088,3.1384,1.5977,3.671,5.3934,0.5183,2.5686,2.0795,0.8111,1.3316,1.3492,1.5286,12.6052,0.585,2.6554,3.3082,6.4665,0.0345,0.7082,2.0529,5.9897,1.1866,0.0003,6.4458,0.4016,3.9286,2.5536,1.8948,7.5883,0.3778,0.0108,0.0032,0.0007,2.1561,6.9057,0.0479,0.0016,0.0001,3.1456,4.6762,7.5328,0.253,1.4565,5.1642,11.4483,5.1911,4.2844,0.0676,1.2188,1.0367,0.0003,4.1297,6.4636,2.4143,0.589,1.9707,4.747,3.7723,1.0034,6.1064,1.7033,0.0296,1.7472,4.9545,0.0001,4.4558,1.2602,10.094,0.8259,0.6862,0.3393,9.0167,0.004,2.7347,0.9474,0.5319,0.3819,1.6053,6.8177,6.0517,4.1644,2.1873,6.0881,0.1203,7.2912,3.6626,1.9322,2.7682,0.0094,7.9517,2.3927,4.3083,1.2866,4.5077,5.1589,4.4839,3.0826,0.7246,0.3185,2.3484,0.8863,2.0394,6.377,0.4587,4.6374,2.452,0.0102,6.2314,0.8369,4.9877,0.9099,0.8055,4.5703,5.7494,5.9537,1.4911,2.8067,1.6107,1.2931,4.2404,1.0954,0.3914,4.4126,5.0413,0.0271,0.0271,0.13,2.5599,3.102,8.1686,1.1166,0.7578,2.0961,4.4932,1.5174,4.8267,6.6305,0.5832,2.8962,2.3195,6.4891,5.1527,2.6627,1.502,3.8637,5.2373,2.7665,0.8667,1.5699,7.9301,0.001,8.9154,4.5899,1.8273,6.3308,5.0235,2.5814,3.095,0.0001,1.7841,0.0008,0.0012,0.0318,2.4327,4.0099,0.023,6.5846,3.4694,1.2188,2.7973,1.87]}
{"id":3541,"ended":true,"length":346,"text":"On 17 February 1895 Nansen began a farewell letter to his wife, Eva, writing that should he come to grief `` you will know that your image will be the last I see``. A few months later he set off on his fourth Arctic voyage to the Pole, accompanied by a large party, mainly of Swedes. Three days into the journey, with the ship `` well ahead of schedule ``, a storm blew in from west-north-west, with gusts of up to 85 km\/h and snow down to the decks.\n\nAfter a night of gale, on 18 and 19 February, Nansen and one companion went ashore to hunt for seals. They were caught in an ice floe and were about to break through when a whaler was seen in the distance. With all haste he set out for the whaler, only to turn back after about an hour with reports of a bear and a leopard on the ice, and with no hope of finding seal. All that was in sight was ice.\n\nAs the ship neared the ship, the sea was so rough that they could do nothing but sit on the poop, or in their cabin below. Then a crack opened up in the ice and he managed, with the help of God, to get onboard where he reported the bad conditions to the ship crew as well as to Governor A.B. Anderson, who was then at Greenland. At the same time another crack opened in the opposite direction and both Nansen and his party watched helplessly as the floe gradually went under.\n\nDespite severe weather and the fact that the ship was completely at sea, both Nansen and the crew managed to land the ship safely in northern Greenland on 24 February 1895. It didn''t take Nansen too long to recuperate, as he was soon leaving again for the Pole.","token_len":377,"entropy":[8.331,2.9274,9.2402,8.0007,5.7652,5.3818,2.53,8.0262,3.5296,0.2408,1.3317,1.878,1.0104,4.6619,0.8041,4.6244,1.1413,10.2743,1.5583,4.2912,0.9975,8.6556,14.1591,9.6182,1.3346,3.4557,1.1726,3.5795,9.6531,2.1222,1.2002,4.3175,3.6442,4.1417,2.3369,8.9606,2.128,4.115,1.2203,2.2023,0.1058,1.8096,5.9382,1.9842,1.9911,1.4717,6.023,10.5496,2.2225,2.1658,1.8024,5.2525,1.2568,3.5402,0.0465,2.1584,4.6629,3.7492,4.4621,6.7345,1.1114,5.0053,0.0442,1.0287,6.5734,1.3634,5.6535,0.7626,2.0413,1.4527,4.6084,1.3677,4.1764,9.2318,6.1178,6.2277,0.2109,4.0685,3.8411,2.6481,3.9931,3.7511,3.7867,3.0502,1.8578,4.2241,3.2897,1.5776,2.2961,1.3363,2.095,3.3493,3.9665,0.0411,0.7798,0.8633,0.0053,5.4267,2.6958,0.2491,0.0539,2.2014,4.6644,6.0927,0.4809,1.9027,6.6945,0.8543,3.9724,0.0429,3.9302,2.1765,4.7415,0.9823,6.5225,0.3487,4.1369,4.7624,2.4369,7.0152,0.0395,0.2588,1.4761,1.3531,0.0031,2.4917,6.6464,5.3233,4.1778,1.3816,2.1071,5.4908,1.0716,5.7603,0.8929,2.3786,2.2081,3.4872,2.1532,3.2607,1.0371,4.4316,0.0204,1.7726,2.5974,5.9907,0.5628,4.8207,3.3556,4.0012,1.5918,6.074,1.9455,4.5847,3.5197,3.2732,0.4015,1.6686,0.3834,4.3447,4.9741,4.2,2.9478,3.7225,1.5652,2.0617,0.6367,4.3485,0.5668,1.1178,4.0769,0.1923,6.3438,0.5772,3.2269,4.5434,2.9573,0.0054,4.7035,8.3315,0.4472,1.4514,5.8709,2.4264,1.3669,6.7993,0.0499,2.9374,0.988,2.9348,2.5767,1.6829,3.9753,3.0198,5.1071,0.1848,2.0736,6.8123,3.0448,5.2,3.277,1.8124,5.1307,3.7247,0.3248,5.1853,1.8531,1.556,0.0002,3.9831,1.27,2.9735,3.7608,0.001,0.3562,4.303,1.8155,1.8885,5.5051,1.4748,3.1629,3.6549,0.3183,4.2951,0.9169,6.5557,1.3266,1.2119,5.2432,1.6032,0.5779,10.0175,2.2703,4.6642,3.5963,2.9843,5.4381,6.0199,1.5317,4.6756,2.4241,7.4127,2.6359,1.1978,2.4154,0.126,1.0674,1.1646,5.2699,5.8328,4.8349,1.51,1.8688,0.643,0.0021,9.3038,0.456,0.0232,2.5476,9.4303,8.2101,0.9285,8.8167,1.4479,5.6393,3.7675,2.3915,0.9668,2.9285,2.234,5.4537,1.0218,0.0489,1.1274,9.1914,5.059,1.3423,4.5676,0.1122,5.8104,1.3003,0.7539,1.6531,4.0483,3.0268,4.9315,0.4348,4.4499,1.6021,1.7913,0.0751,5.998,1.6776,0.7905,2.376,0.0574,8.9319,0.6991,1.1099,6.7185,3.4659,0.0019,0.052,2.5928,4.3774,7.407,4.2382,0.0066,0.4625,0.4976,6.2203,0.9046,6.8506,4.5278,4.3387,2.2484,1.1581,0.0001,6.3006,6.5916,1.3689,2.5646,1.9802,2.657,0.0407,1.1484,1.8645,0.5804,5.4875,5.1943,0.4221,0.357,4.9187,0.9728,0.001,0.0374,1.6604,2.4773,3.5514,0.0455,3.8901,4.0227,1.9477,1.0605,2.5698,7.7373,1.4689,2.7719,3.8113,0.5668,0.7088,0.3465,3.5947,7.9031,9.5648,0.0019,0.3856,5.5057,0.0024,4.7584,0.0071,0.1869,7.7809,0.4442,0.0,2.2967,2.3905,0.7135,1.933,4.8776,6.9475,6.6322,2.1279,1.7009,3.0838,0.9092]}

{"id":3173,"ended":true,"length":356,"text":"The episode progresses mostly through footage streamed from a fixed camera in booth nine of the call centre setting. Streams from other cameras are displayed on the side of the screen, in the lower left corner, as the main character tries to work out a problem with one of the company\u2019s call systems, while being questioned by corporate employees. The camera is positioned so that it can see the entire desk area \u2013 including the telephone, monitor and keyboard \u2013 so the audience can see the actions of the characters.\n\nDuring the first part of the episode, viewers get a chance to observe the characters on and off the screen. Characters are shown typing on keyboards and moving around the screen, but are sometimes obscured by the telephone and monitor. During these periods, video of the characters\u2019 private lives is cut in to give a fuller picture of the people at work and to establish a personal attachment to the characters.\n\nAnother technique which is repeated throughout the episode is that of panning the camera across and around the desk area, as both the protagonist and the antagonist are working. This technique demonstrates the physicality and closeness of the two characters and is used to heighten tension and suspense.\n\nAs the work progresses, the company\u2019s phone system becomes increasingly unwieldy and the protagonist\u2019s attempts at fixing it do not achieve as much success as planned. As this happens, footage of the protagonist outside the office is streamed through the screen, either in its entirety or in parts, to show the protagonist \u2018working\u2019 elsewhere. This also reinforces the personal link between the characters and the audience.\n\nAt the end of the episode, the two characters finally resolve the problem. The characters then get back to their screens as the call centre staff resume their work. As the episode ends, streams of employees and other information streams off of the screen.","token_len":377,"entropy":[8.8918,9.7565,7.7083,2.3833,9.0204,11.6865,1.6353,2.6031,7.2761,2.7431,3.2521,10.8145,7.4119,1.8262,0.5828,9.7838,2.1212,8.1685,1.1776,9.5225,1.471,2.4833,4.1558,2.9304,1.1226,3.774,1.8903,0.7378,4.8901,0.451,0.1906,2.6645,1.7423,3.5986,1.7391,5.2347,1.0689,0.4495,1.9392,2.8632,2.2832,4.9807,3.868,4.5185,0.0662,5.4722,1.0778,3.2974,4.9572,1.7488,4.3593,0.1687,0.3646,6.5129,15.9667,7.9161,1.1679,6.2759,5.9941,2.9525,2.8535,6.5676,8.0098,0.5011,8.5587,3.4179,0.8814,2.2355,3.8061,2.5994,3.2722,3.3002,0.252,1.7009,1.4548,3.0913,1.3009,4.3166,8.932,3.2098,6.8985,2.2989,0.5247,6.3156,2.2478,7.4739,1.1117,5.1268,1.0786,4.1708,2.2119,3.5687,0.5516,1.5361,1.3976,6.9147,0.8724,0.6601,4.1304,0.9778,0.9088,0.0008,4.3717,0.5573,3.035,3.5175,0.1249,0.1327,0.7976,0.236,5.1587,3.8065,1.5984,1.9485,0.0133,4.5511,0.8545,3.2308,4.2816,6.2694,0.1063,0.9484,2.3978,0.9754,6.3896,1.5502,1.7009,8.0133,2.1753,4.6399,1.4341,5.0042,1.4653,1.6913,2.1912,1.4662,3.2449,3.7519,5.6512,4.9247,0.2963,1.808,7.6431,2.3722,0.5397,0.6163,3.6839,4.4968,5.5483,0.5736,5.4521,2.373,0.5223,1.1052,13.4473,0.3209,14.772,4.6709,3.3142,5.4217,4.2512,4.7915,4.0466,2.7212,4.3234,1.4517,0.2652,0.6143,4.4928,4.0247,1.1346,2.5381,2.7204,5.8339,1.9599,4.8035,7.4791,0.7178,0.643,0.8057,0.3205,0.8994,0.0002,5.3306,6.2233,4.6999,1.4632,7.3673,1.1344,0.1538,0.8388,0.1868,3.014,0.6885,6.4606,0.2428,1.1579,2.4877,3.6448,5.8962,1.8898,0.3846,3.5346,0.7947,1.8961,2.6304,6.0266,1.2935,5.507,0.093,0.9302,5.0624,1.6445,4.1082,3.009,1.6813,1.4896,7.5707,0.9801,6.5038,2.6042,2.2916,6.397,0.0001,0.2386,0.3066,4.3922,0.607,2.503,2.8184,1.565,1.1816,7.6584,0.0026,3.029,1.7198,3.6774,1.0252,0.9158,0.0002,4.0772,1.2133,7.0,1.0791,0.3504,0.9028,5.9943,4.5526,0.0419,0.0118,4.7139,2.2272,2.4299,2.064,8.4511,0.0153,0.0019,1.1507,1.7675,4.9503,4.2065,0.005,0.123,4.7352,3.0662,5.6544,0.8922,6.2561,0.2677,5.8704,5.2216,0.6691,1.3465,0.8182,4.8714,0.1589,3.0779,4.035,1.8243,0.138,6.8263,0.6604,0.3469,3.9056,8.0242,0.8032,1.8832,1.4172,5.9022,4.6062,0.9998,3.2807,1.7483,7.8264,2.6031,4.8293,1.2135,0.1924,1.1547,3.5866,1.9618,2.0805,2.7009,0.7747,4.7767,5.5285,6.7828,5.4117,2.1617,0.3639,8.7792,0.4787,2.4533,4.4528,5.2286,0.3017,5.8301,6.5997,0.5309,0.169,1.0941,0.5224,0.503,4.6423,0.7632,0.4784,0.0002,4.445,0.8138,0.4303,0.0522,0.2161,0.4399,0.084,0.8352,4.4072,0.9682,4.3195,4.2697,1.4238,1.3249,2.4263,1.4615,4.0169,4.5236,4.4997,2.4096,0.4849,2.7141,7.0538,4.3708,1.2916,4.4969,0.5223,3.5782,8.0229,0.8576,1.2582,0.5423,3.5681,0.9229,4.2472,3.1992,0.1166,9.8384,0.8159,5.5865,2.5749,3.652,5.6904,7.1574,8.189,2.5053,0.2679,1.4977,4.5606]}

As the sun sank on the day, the band struck up the familiar Christmas carols, the boys started lining up for the parade to be inspected by Colonel Weir, and the people of the town flocked to the gates and to the viewing stands and stood along every side of the grandstand. On the grandstand side were also the boys\u2019 families, who formed part of the Corps, and also on the side of the track as spectators to witness not only the inspection of the Corps but also the inspection of the contingent that was to accompany them. On the day of the inspection, we also had a great deal of correspondence with the Governor-General and in this letter, he asks that our contingent, as part of the Corps, also be inspected and we are therefore included with the contingent that is to accompany them. A great many of the boys and their fathers were present and it was a particularly fine sight as men and boys marched up and down past the gallant Weir, while he inspected them.\n\nIn his letter to Governor-General Lord Lytton at Port Adelaide on the 29th December 1914, Lieutenant-Colonel Weir informed him that:\n\nMorphettville is being held for us. I have just arrived. There is to be a parade to-morrow. We are to be inspected by the Governor-General. We have arrived in time to start tomorrow morning.

However, she got into the judges' houses and made it into the next round.","token_len":377,"entropy":[7.6897,3.0706,4.5334,0.4374,5.5415,10.5382,0.7384,4.7789,1.8275,2.0724,9.389,1.4159,6.666,0.0161,8.3891,5.5003,0.8444,4.8081,0.4285,2.5317,0.2539,3.6174,1.0212,3.5222,0.9085,5.8563,0.2493,0.3384,7.4637,4.7164,1.8804,2.0695,1.6526,3.7743,0.053,2.9492,8.6346,0.0153,1.5915,3.4988,2.2748,1.3946,0.4144,4.4146,3.289,3.6937,0.2621,0.0727,3.2919,3.1253,6.5648,6.9314,4.7174,5.0867,2.5847,2.9465,3.2154,2.7179,0.03,0.2059,0.2956,0.3719,1.9121,5.4742,0.2385,2.764,1.6738,4.0891,4.6581,1.377,0.5209,0.9209,1.2559,0.0013,4.0525,0.0012,1.5475,3.8588,2.0022,1.0534,0.6317,2.4192,0.3588,0.1596,0.2128,0.0072,0.3104,0.0037,2.3722,1.0751,2.7585,3.0315,3.486,4.9846,8.4847,2.339,4.8479,4.2205,1.5162,0.9059,1.4394,7.4692,0.0222,0.0781,15.3331,3.5604,3.3689,4.0345,2.6683,4.3001,2.3445,6.7922,0.2971,1.5493,5.9201,0.0211,0.7906,1.0146,2.9101,1.3471,2.1061,1.8095,1.8436,5.0559,5.2898,5.5173,2.83,0.8384,1.9051,7.6002,0.1018,0.7772,3.7867,1.9274,0.9896,0.0002,1.917,3.6784,1.8947,0.4712,0.0715,1.2337,6.6625,5.9072,7.4805,3.1168,6.3013,2.1892,1.5996,3.4584,3.4116,0.0122,1.1997,3.9144,5.7323,2.6283,5.9681,3.41,2.3541,3.3039,1.2985,0.5694,1.4061,0.2743,0.3245,1.1953,5.0002,0.0146,7.4479,9.5498,1.2538,1.4878,0.5793,0.5017,2.9376,1.7984,2.3615,2.1471,4.5901,8.0124,5.4881,2.3012,2.0878,3.3462,0.0013,7.0378,1.1498,1.2423,3.0369,2.6974,0.7873,1.552,0.0001,3.8667,2.9653,4.5696,0.0557,0.1167,0.0052,0.083,0.0045,0.112,1.1674,6.2681,0.9356,3.4549,3.6597,5.8335,1.1783,0.2851,3.1967,5.5108,0.8076,3.1973,2.5268,2.8082,10.6921,3.3884,3.904,2.6582,0.4286,0.3019,0.8912,0.0002,1.3843,3.3783,1.951,0.1119,0.0867,0.7785,2.631,1.6359,7.0588,2.0878,3.9913,1.9523,5.5317,0.5142,5.0932,0.2972,5.2408,4.5092,2.3131,2.8641,1.5257,0.7793,4.7129,0.5367,9.7367,0.0259,2.3494,0.8504,1.7233,6.8123,2.8272,2.3109,5.6362,3.2148,3.3439,1.785,2.9521,0.5491,9.1335,2.3926,2.913,4.5184,6.5694,0.3534,1.2918,0.4523,0.6683,2.367,0.1783,5.7044,0.509,2.0661,1.1429,0.4984,1.9089,0.5558,0.0001,2.0131,2.9813,1.5684,0.0908,0.497,4.5119,2.6345,6.6344,1.8288,0.5535,2.9166,3.311,1.8563,7.7167,0.0094,2.422,7.1654,0.7289,10.764,0.0468,6.5763,3.1689,3.8163,7.38,9.3657,3.0832,5.7242,1.8604,0.8338,1.4135,4.5538,8.1879,5.9897,5.0745,0.3867,4.2641,0.0441,4.4474,1.964,3.103,3.3028,3.2972,2.9769,1.4808,3.9564,2.1653,0.3753,0.0303,0.153,0.0071,0.1104,0.0041,0.4715,1.9609,3.3526,0.0776,2.4379,2.6473,0.2249,3.4095,0.2315,0.7848,3.3767,0.2706,3.3576,6.2578,2.7565,2.0014,2.9025,2.3978,2.6195,1.9927,5.2078,5.3467,1.1533,0.1672,0.8009,0.412,4.547,0.0231,1.3436,4.7948,1.7644,0.3995,4.9359,0.1139,10.0696,1.5488,4.0279,2.6735,1.5487,0.2891,5.4558,1.7662,1.2698]}

The cars, run on narrow tyres, have an enlarged engine cover to allow the engine to be seen. It was at this time that the new V6 engine was introduced, running with a turbocharger and running closer to 1.

The engine manufacturers chose not to continue further development of the V10 engine, instead developing a new generation of engines, using turbocharging and smaller displacement, to be introduced for the W In 2011, Formula One took its first major step to increase the costs of competing in motorsport, by introducing a new type of fuel called diesel.\n\nThe sport was forced to suspend the use of these fuels at the end of that season due to the difficulty in controlling emissions and fuel economy. The W, which is being gradually phased out of the sport, lasted for only six seasons. The V6 hybrid turbo V6 engine was introduced a year later by Toyota, Honda, Renault and BMW. Under the current system of engine regulations, the engines are capable of making more than, have less weight and produce less carbon dioxide than the V10 engine.","token_len":377,"entropy":[6.5261,3.5757,5.6828,1.3508,2.8786,2.5543,0.0843,2.0147,3.4696,1.8704,0.3705,10.7739,1.2443,3.8243,0.7763,6.2378,3.5879,3.4988,7.0913,0.5403,5.0332,2.5368,3.3263,0.0403,7.5382,11.2077,4.8878,1.0919,1.2101,4.0284,0.8801,0.0319,6.7852,6.2219,1.1023,1.6693,4.4485,3.0522,6.3894,5.8882,4.8757,1.1327,6.8503,1.1696,0.0334,2.3444,1.7488,0.9542,5.9145,5.3064,0.7774,11.0646,0.2389,1.7574,4.2393,3.5094,2.5676,5.9519,3.5453,6.6133,3.1385,8.9022,3.8082,0.7021,3.9591,4.9713,8.4099,2.9947,5.9143,3.1408,2.9258,2.3368,3.1551,0.1841,1.5492,5.8982,4.2648,4.0243,2.1227,4.6542,0.8312,0.5424,0.1938,1.5836,4.3566,4.9418,2.2558,1.9922,0.9313,0.8187,1.327,6.038,4.6694,1.1767,3.2963,1.4665,0.0042,1.9593,4.785,10.1806,0.0338,4.7562,1.1486,12.6201,2.263,6.5828,0.0354,8.1104,4.1224,5.0249,0.194,0.7435,0.7339,4.9207,7.4769,2.525,1.4184,3.9784,6.6264,2.7758,6.7376,1.2486,2.0453,3.0852,3.1238,3.5345,2.2034,4.7307,3.4537,0.2061,5.8583,6.7096,2.0317,1.1908,3.6777,1.1072,1.5715,0.0034,4.335,4.6852,1.8642,3.1277,0.1298,4.4559,2.603,0.9707,2.3043,4.7521,2.2845,0.5527,3.5207,4.3935,4.3415,3.7828,9.3233,1.7064,2.4088,5.1576,3.4737,0.5345,6.0722,0.144,0.0031,4.7013,1.057,5.9745,2.8826,5.2589,1.6845,17.6515,3.1003,7.2681,3.8397,2.7003,1.6415,2.4303,3.3014,0.7258,4.3319,1.7293,3.1632,1.8249,0.014,3.7394,4.9605,0.0283,1.6697,4.1725,6.5569,6.3279,2.2753,5.2117,0.5739,5.6431,4.9252,1.4007,16.9531,1.4698,4.8199,6.8424,0.0653,3.7821,0.6852,4.2672,6.3542,5.7123,2.1775,0.4843,2.266,5.0781,5.717,6.6435,2.3422,0.0053,3.9147,6.9912,1.3336,0.7397,0.303,1.1865,1.1046,1.595,1.0371,3.1086,3.6822,1.2088,1.1911,4.422,0.2899,2.674,1.8834,4.5956,5.6182,2.5214,2.0966,6.2318,3.408,2.1447,2.5525,3.9402,4.6008,4.1846,0.8223,6.7256,15.6094,7.5007,1.6964,8.2484,0.3109,5.3011,2.87,0.8592,3.1089,0.486,3.4039,5.1235,1.1041,7.5628,0.3238,6.2118,0.7656,5.5975,0.1213,1.3566,2.6513,2.2833,1.0774,1.2798,5.6815,0.0039,3.9985,6.2191,5.8229,1.304,1.2529,0.0002,1.7911,7.9093,2.5406,4.8704,0.1749,6.3278,1.7369,2.1129,0.0079,4.1869,2.6001,3.9626,0.6385,0.8412,0.0029,4.5422,2.0629,2.5823,0.0097,1.3067,6.0359,1.2504,4.6873,2.7978,1.9918,3.5808,2.5809,1.101,1.8319,4.5604,6.6052,2.078,2.8943,6.0419,6.1079,0.986,0.075,2.1379,1.0352,0.486,0.6234,8.8554,2.5549,2.7844,2.882,1.7186,2.4703,1.9341,4.1912,2.0452,7.1462,4.7176,5.7414,0.7621,1.1468,1.3929,1.2198,5.8089,0.7943,0.2555,4.8743,5.681,1.1301,7.2883,1.0925,2.0891,0.7036,3.2415,1.2213,6.2586,0.7863,3.9346,2.0743,2.4182,4.7374,3.5684,0.2892,1.3351,3.8384,1.1655,4.6755,0.0165,5.2607,3.515,0.4989,9.3201,8.6295,2.3851,5.2951,1.0001,4.4179,1.1921,3.9147,1.5862,1.3275,0.8737,1.4267,2.6446,2.0202,0.6126]}
{"id":2053,"ended":false,"length":348,"text":"North @ - @ Eastern Area Command was formed at Townsville, Queensland, on 15 January 1942, taking over the eastern portion of what was previously Northern Area Command. Northern Area had been formed at Brisbane in early 1943, as part of the reorganisation into divisions. The Eastern Air Area, which had been formed in 1941, had an area of 100,000 square miles and an army of 600,000 people under the command of a General. The new area was smaller but the strength of the command was much larger, with 18,000 airmen. There were nine bases and three flying training centres and five of them were located within one hour s drive of Townsville. The only major city in the area was Townsville but the other centres had a total of 1. 7 million people as residents ; all those in the whole area contributed to defence - building and training efforts : mining, agriculture, fishing and a large part of the population worked on farms which had to be protected from the enemy bombers and had to provide food for the military men. Townsville was a small inland city with a population of about 110,000. The airport was located at Townsville, Queensland and consisted of a grass run-way. An airfield was necessary for military use : there was little possibility of air power making a raid over the vast area that was necessary to invade Australia. Most of the main bases would be too small for landing or taking off large air-craft. During 1944\/45 there were a number of air raids by small fighter aircraft and low-flying bomber aircraft over many of the main bases and Townsville which caused considerable discomfort to the personnel and considerable damage to equipment : a base was lost to the Japanese near Townsville in early 1944 ; by the end of the war, Townsville suffered serious damage.

He returned the following year and earned the best player award after finishing third overall in the tournament with 15 points, including the memorable game-winning, fourth-period goal against Finland. Fleury's third trip to Canada's \"A\" team did not go as well, however; he lost his starting job to the injured Carey Price, and was relegated to the bench for the bronze medal game.\n\nAt 19 years old, Fleury made his AHL debut on Oct. 20, 1988, in a 13-10 loss to the St. Catharines Falcons. Not only was the 6' 1\", 185-pound teenager on the ice to help defend his own goal; he also played a key role in the Falcons' comeback with an empty net goal to cap off his first professional game.\n\nFleury is one of only three players in NHL history to both score 100 career regular-season AND playoff goals.

{"id":1821,"ended":true,"length":324,"text":"Besides the nucleolus, the nucleus contains a number of other non @ - @ membrane @ - @ delineated bodies. These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase <GIB> and the retinosomes. Although all of them are involved in DNA biosynthesis, they are not identical to each other. Here, an experimental study has been undertaken to characterize the interaction between the nucleolus and these non- @ @ @ membrane delineated bodies. The interaction between the nuclear body and non- @ @ membrane delineated bodies are determined by examining the distribution of different kinds of complexes on and within the body. The non - @ @ - @ membrane delineated bodies also act as an aid in the formation of chromatin. This is demonstrated in the case. of the retinosomes, as they are involved in the localization of different parts of the genome at a particular stage. The nucleolus contributes to the formation of chromatin also by binding to different proteins on the retinosomes. The interaction of nucleolar proteins with retino proteins requires the formation of retino - nuclear complexes. It is also demonstrated that the nucleolus can form complexes or complexes of complex nucleolar proteins. Complex nucleolar protein is also identified on the nuclear envelope.\n\nProteomic analysis of the nucleolus is a powerful tool to investigate many aspects of cellular biology. Here we describe an analysis of nucleolar proteins at the single cell level. We demonstrate that nucleolar proteins present a characteristic proteomic signature after a few hundred cells are processed into single cell RNA-seq datasets. We describe this signature which can be used to identify different cell types or subtypes within a complex. We demonstrate that the nucleolar proteins in a single cell RNA-seq dataset can be organized by using a protein-folding database such as PROFAR.","token_len":378,"entropy":[2.4727,11.6896,5.6742,4.3465,1.1862,1.5647,3.5537,2.7195,2.2089,2.3905,0.0058,2.9054,6.0437,16.7659,5.2354,8.2494,10.4278,9.8157,3.0081,2.3572,14.1151,2.8782,7.3263,1.0909,1.9506,1.8499,6.6925,8.0783,1.1487,6.5831,0.6823,12.9113,8.6195,7.3902,4.1455,2.4727,0.3891,13.3199,1.1769,6.5925,5.3419,10.1077,5.7906,9.0598,1.1841,3.8584,3.5412,8.3093,6.4189,2.6918,1.7426,5.754,3.8577,1.1413,3.2882,1.1296,5.2959,0.1928,5.2921,5.4496,0.0214,0.4742,2.2408,1.0112,1.8166,4.8652,1.9853,1.6156,0.0318,0.9,5.372,1.5889,5.4476,5.6832,3.4536,3.196,2.8235,2.6874,0.3539,4.1853,0.6566,4.7035,0.4117,1.2179,1.9527,0.1939,0.0211,0.5414,4.8029,3.0458,0.9834,2.7154,2.3137,4.4082,2.1308,9.5115,0.7802,0.0742,0.6322,1.6832,4.1201,1.0429,0.6876,6.5303,5.0699,0.4231,3.6727,0.122,0.2395,0.0918,1.568,1.4338,0.0193,0.3258,5.2647,4.9522,0.2923,6.2839,0.6369,6.3799,0.1308,5.0844,6.9623,0.014,7.1706,3.4017,6.0987,2.4112,0.4678,4.6861,0.6887,1.4235,4.5406,3.8606,0.1096,0.4162,6.4152,0.6162,1.5722,1.1663,0.031,0.3227,4.2701,6.1768,0.4211,3.1525,6.1222,1.2197,1.4217,3.8569,0.0723,6.2328,0.1326,2.1199,3.2845,1.8498,4.7292,2.0525,0.9981,2.9537,8.6785,6.1315,1.1848,5.9744,0.2344,0.4604,1.7645,3.8673,3.4847,1.1401,4.0914,0.0423,1.2419,7.0474,0.2155,4.3055,4.3868,0.064,0.3485,2.0148,4.8095,3.3021,2.6378,5.909,1.6102,1.5413,3.4697,0.1358,0.0055,6.3019,0.5254,0.5983,2.2187,0.0361,1.4731,0.0057,6.7895,1.323,4.0965,1.0441,3.7841,3.491,3.8114,0.5312,4.2258,0.5648,0.316,0.581,1.3926,3.2615,2.0796,2.1748,6.6308,2.9425,1.0338,4.7758,1.3088,7.9841,5.5723,1.5581,2.6491,0.0144,5.5877,0.5224,6.0443,6.8306,0.3723,0.9546,4.1768,0.5107,2.6463,2.7631,0.4884,0.8835,1.369,0.374,0.0104,2.9236,3.5817,3.4845,5.6641,2.2722,1.3958,4.3861,3.7142,2.0936,0.8282,1.1701,5.9695,1.1535,0.4141,2.7994,3.4649,3.4585,5.5484,3.3629,0.4726,4.6823,7.1092,2.2753,3.1295,0.0038,5.7058,2.1124,5.0569,3.897,0.9128,1.1691,1.3258,0.1333,0.01,3.2332,2.8856,5.2648,0.6063,2.0288,3.2262,4.9474,2.0408,0.0437,3.7257,1.6622,0.5142,3.5396,1.7128,3.4624,3.5485,3.3143,0.2334,3.3623,2.8908,0.5711,4.3066,1.0881,6.5645,3.7403,0.3111,1.2988,1.7969,3.5529,0.3701,2.1584,0.6412,0.2612,5.5683,2.0617,5.7192,8.481,0.2702,2.297,6.5305,2.5676,3.6075,3.8441,4.4346,1.7671,5.1288,3.1363,5.0752,1.904,5.6029,4.7149,1.257,3.6036,0.3487,1.7636,3.8823,4.5476,3.6332,6.867,2.3096,0.2566,1.8237,0.4686,2.0557,4.3649,3.7292,0.5928,3.6963,4.2717,1.8391,4.2938,1.1908,3.9764,0.7549,1.1746,2.5594,0.3505,1.2361,1.8272,1.4947,0.3655,3.141,2.1917,3.3464,0.3685,4.5518,0.1288,0.0016,0.1565,1.7417,0.7151,7.4899,2.9193,4.331,1.7685,5.4986,1.7798,6.0034,1.6717,6.9926,5.3091,0.0891,7.0351,5.6017,5.1872,1.1623]}

Children who have spent time with a father who plays an active role in their lives tend to show more academic success, are more polite, and have healthier behavior. There have been many, many studies which show children of single parents have a tendency to be less healthy and less well adjusted than children with two parents. And, for those who may wonder, there are indeed studies which show that children with two parents are, on average and compared to children whose parents divorced, more intelligent, better behaved, more cooperative, better disciplined and more pleasant to be around.\n\nBut there are also studies and studies which show that children raised to be self - reliant, confident, independent, and resourceful are healthier AND better off in adult years. There are also studies which show that men who stay home with their children are the more nurturing and nurturing ones in most areas, both emotionally AND physically.\n\nAnd so, what do I want you to do? I do not want you to think that staying or working at home with your kids all the time is the only way to be a good dad, nor that playing with your kids constantly or giving them loads of attention is the sole way to be a good parent. I do not believe that you need to be at home 24\/7 to teach your kids values and morals. In fact, I want you to work WITH them, not constantly being in charge and telling them what to do.\n\nI want you to make your values and morals (like love) transparent to the kids, to be patient and kind with them, and to show them that you have fun with them too. They will absorb your example, and it will matter, so make sure it matters.","token_len":378,"entropy":[4.4819,0.1446,2.4276,4.8188,4.1459,4.0556,3.2657,2.9745,5.1877,0.0164,3.16,9.279,3.5972,0.8348,4.595,1.1606,0.0582,4.4773,2.3032,9.0571,2.2065,2.7318,9.281,12.6608,8.0225,3.3271,7.5293,4.5126,2.5336,0.5356,4.7283,7.4963,1.6837,6.4659,2.0542,2.1122,4.6976,1.3943,0.7456,2.508,1.603,1.6073,6.0959,3.6525,1.5373,0.1217,0.3614,0.305,1.0713,4.1318,0.037,4.5896,2.0411,6.5967,3.4234,1.634,3.3314,0.7293,9.5728,0.8199,0.8474,2.1947,4.5172,5.2659,0.9198,4.4455,1.8886,0.4244,0.7067,6.5404,0.1495,0.3104,0.8974,3.2275,5.5065,4.6709,4.1921,1.3102,3.0146,1.6882,7.0203,0.0948,2.0084,2.0265,5.6727,1.2003,1.7684,4.1439,2.681,2.4279,0.6366,2.8059,2.6627,1.2014,0.8794,3.8461,2.571,4.2783,1.9601,0.9518,4.7622,6.6654,1.4187,2.357,1.124,6.3121,2.0775,0.8044,1.168,1.2088,1.9872,1.8772,2.0546,0.4328,1.1985,5.1396,1.1212,0.0176,8.3634,7.3464,0.5247,0.3214,4.6127,0.989,5.7261,0.9622,3.9131,4.1706,0.51,4.8145,1.6356,0.2354,2.5598,5.2197,0.3573,4.2463,5.972,1.7167,1.0221,7.038,0.5476,0.9312,0.0701,0.4466,2.3386,0.0838,3.3216,2.4854,0.9134,1.2313,0.8057,5.6968,1.2551,0.3793,1.0043,0.5796,1.2896,4.6307,5.8072,0.9216,6.3274,8.8162,6.2605,1.3424,7.6837,0.5242,3.3607,0.7423,1.9059,6.6852,0.0027,1.281,4.476,7.269,3.2895,2.8645,3.6821,5.8527,5.3742,0.6681,2.94,0.4477,1.3033,0.2339,0.508,0.4162,0.4693,7.2241,1.1334,5.0658,1.8813,0.7659,0.5574,1.3364,1.2141,4.8339,3.0971,5.0424,1.2097,2.2627,5.4091,2.3584,6.0813,4.4105,3.5472,5.3341,4.423,7.5654,0.6097,0.339,1.6684,0.0002,2.1429,4.0411,1.2735,3.247,2.1726,3.1697,4.7453,2.6108,0.0825,1.1328,0.8458,2.4266,5.0134,0.86,0.4002,0.6058,0.0415,3.044,0.5765,6.2712,7.7057,2.5427,2.3026,0.4856,1.0862,0.3293,2.3842,6.6559,1.0803,0.0125,0.7063,2.3377,2.0006,0.6365,0.3783,2.4918,1.7073,1.2082,1.3346,2.1412,5.2087,1.3934,7.0666,1.2202,0.9666,0.3501,6.7066,3.7034,5.0632,0.3101,8.1725,0.0918,2.1449,0.9408,0.4725,6.4924,0.7854,0.1504,0.3593,0.3696,0.136,2.2593,0.1777,1.1988,1.1987,0.231,3.7226,0.3087,2.8635,2.8428,0.1991,1.7057,4.0496,0.2597,7.1655,0.303,0.0004,1.0412,5.8575,0.2984,0.3849,8.4932,1.17,5.6904,1.0528,4.4389,0.1362,0.0576,0.7867,3.9406,0.5371,0.0212,3.7263,7.3206,2.8369,2.4011,3.0147,5.4356,6.2974,2.703,3.2744,3.6936,4.7056,0.0602,1.6609,0.554,0.3462,0.8416,1.3156,0.0002,1.614,1.5239,0.1701,0.0311,4.0211,2.1742,8.3149,1.0118,0.5305,6.414,4.4804,5.0111,2.8104,6.1205,1.4419,2.3922,1.9107,1.8749,2.3508,3.7756,8.2397,1.0836,4.4255,3.8713,0.1879,0.7336,0.8776,0.5786,4.5025,0.5626,1.2852,1.1961,3.7265,6.4305,1.7226,0.3783,4.7353,0.4518,6.6676,1.2298,8.7302,2.0254,8.9326,1.8165,1.2066,4.3292,0.2406,6.2089,4.0103,4.1854,4.2702,0.6629,3.7467,3.7013,1.4475]}

The gameplay is based on questioning characters while presenting evidence as well as playing action mini-games\u2014allowing players to earn new evidence or use existing evidence to increase their chances of winning. To help players understand the series' mysteries, many puzzles are solved by asking questions, which is the main mode of interaction with the game. The series also incorporates many recurring motifs, such as the concept of the \"red herring\" in order to mislead the player, as well as the notion of a \"burden of proof\", which requires that the player proves their case beyond a reasonable doubt.","token_len":378,"entropy":[10.6257,1.689,0.7688,3.6564,4.4185,2.0508,1.3429,3.142,10.1751,2.4921,10.0974,0.7216,0.8768,0.828,1.4773,6.7628,0.093,2.4341,7.5713,7.2533,6.042,0.788,12.2713,3.2903,0.8721,2.1382,0.2415,0.5506,2.4271,3.4371,5.2837,6.2189,0.0916,0.955,5.613,1.8754,2.3375,3.8968,2.202,6.6563,0.1927,0.6123,1.0983,6.1372,1.8161,6.0061,1.7929,3.3328,0.8622,2.5683,6.1202,4.8083,6.3741,4.6592,0.4534,3.0979,0.4732,0.9772,3.6431,0.0001,10.3133,3.0934,1.6718,1.5222,4.2236,5.6794,2.5752,2.3135,6.0068,0.3726,1.5598,1.2145,0.0023,4.3176,6.1516,4.2631,2.8869,1.2608,8.3405,0.9427,7.1021,6.9858,1.5103,0.6787,0.8283,3.0813,1.1605,2.4992,3.2417,0.1325,9.0248,0.0564,4.7657,0.0049,0.5472,7.0655,1.3491,0.1139,3.6712,7.4644,0.6691,6.5204,2.2669,0.9713,4.3241,0.26,0.5864,1.8033,7.2729,0.9763,0.0394,3.6038,1.1281,4.6213,1.027,5.5048,7.6174,2.7279,4.9147,4.9799,9.9377,2.0561,2.5782,7.4381,4.8003,0.1239,0.0005,0.355,6.1273,3.9947,5.5547,6.0244,4.2629,0.0342,4.3571,3.802,3.801,6.9626,0.0065,6.7802,1.9763,0.2557,7.6547,3.5872,1.0213,4.5376,0.0001,0.0001,6.3522,2.1642,6.8037,1.1464,2.7629,4.7647,3.7495,0.3094,0.9982,4.3112,3.4017,1.9783,4.8748,2.4585,1.7739,4.2002,0.0872,0.7664,3.211,4.7076,3.6924,3.3915,0.6602,0.2187,1.5569,4.5986,4.9495,12.5937,1.9629,4.7098,6.4434,4.4821,7.2909,2.5653,5.5124,5.9187,7.6842,1.0319,2.1183,0.3233,4.1623,0.9437,4.3502,1.6619,3.7045,0.4697,4.1853,2.4591,5.0588,1.6044,0.0432,8.1291,2.1829,5.1931,8.5381,1.9151,2.1412,4.2886,3.041,1.1464,0.6763,2.5096,1.8113,5.595,3.9518,4.6673,2.574,8.6883,0.8305,6.6743,2.9619,1.6407,7.1043,3.3585,0.0685,1.7831,3.2009,0.4054,2.809,5.1561,1.9784,2.7258,0.3054,0.0806,0.4401,0.0001,2.2679,2.7057,3.9066,1.6645,5.0695,0.0155,6.1732,6.1606,0.9735,5.6462,0.5052,0.6988,3.1733,3.8028,3.1705,3.2981,5.2917,2.8568,1.3535,4.5332,3.405,0.477,0.4504,1.3218,1.0669,1.2719,5.0619,1.232,3.5657,0.3643,12.8493,5.3877,5.1086,5.2432,3.5013,3.5756,2.4067,0.057,5.5806,6.4926,9.6963,0.0345,0.0203,8.7295,5.1365,5.2618,1.225,0.1096,7.1801,4.6953,5.9929,3.2122,3.8682,3.1942,0.4897,1.1268,6.5953,0.3339,1.1367,0.1749,1.5767,0.8931,5.8737,3.2099,0.9435,2.1109,0.5878,2.7253,0.7489,5.9329,0.3144,3.8619,3.1522,1.2611,2.859,1.6346,4.2173,2.313,2.6442,2.4012,2.4845,3.2039,2.2014,4.4176,0.4582,6.3519,1.9572,0.3689,0.883,0.4849,1.7585,3.1178,1.4439,4.8476,3.3475,8.1371,4.9097,0.0054,1.4044,0.7537,0.0013,1.5789,5.7065,0.0368,2.096,1.7777,6.7327,4.9957,0.1067,1.0989,2.6919,6.26,0.0165,7.3251,1.4062,0.4653,1.8294,2.2321,0.5349,0.0046,1.1573,5.0109,0.6977,2.1181,1.1324,5.5785,4.7632,1.1818,0.098,2.7293,1.0678,4.8958,2.6933,1.0125,0.7124,7.3303,1.5155,1.6176,6.0226,0.5096,0.1615,0.0063,0.5589]}
{"id":1903,"ended":false,"length":357,"text":"Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians. In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, pregnancy prevention was generally seen as a woman's responsibility, and the idea of using condoms was likely alien. Although ancient civilizations did adopt sexual health practices, like the invention of the condom, sex wasn't as commonplace as it is today. Women were expected to only have \"one good marriage,\" and men had no choice in the matter; marriage was not a choice. And because of this, contraception likely wasn't something these cultures would have had very much of.\n\nIn the modern era, pregnancy was rarely discussed in society because birth control was almost unheard of. There's little written by physicians on sexual health practices that have survived from ancient times because most of the world only recently started to gain access to information about sex. The information that was available at the time was often crude, unverified, and contradictory.\n\nAccording to the History Channel, many ancient cultures used the term \"barren woman\" to describe a woman with a large belly who was unable to bear children. \"The belief that a woman with a large belly had been impregnated by only one man, that she had borne only one child and was barren, meant that she was a threat to the survival of her family,\" the History Channel says. \"If she was killed early in her pregnancy, it was believed that the child would take her place at the head of the family.\" This kind of superstition is probably what lead to many cultures discouraging sexual activity, but also having no issue condemning woman who got pregnant.\n\nAristotle Onassis and the late Princess Caroline of Monaco (who is said to have had eight children from Aristotle), by the way, didn't have any issues.\n\nPhoto: Domenico Starnone\/Corbis\n\nSource: The Atlantic","token_len":378,"entropy":[13.1503,3.3011,2.396,1.4432,7.6018,5.6878,5.7324,5.8097,3.1641,2.6907,1.7951,2.6262,1.0329,2.9996,4.0287,1.9019,0.3243,11.2958,0.5458,0.9233,0.3633,0.2502,6.968,6.4092,0.785,5.3346,4.0264,0.1115,0.8711,5.2355,0.0415,1.8451,1.3036,1.7136,2.5602,3.6782,0.7349,3.598,1.2568,1.0401,7.3708,8.3875,3.4862,4.7544,4.6983,5.2636,2.8067,4.9524,5.7468,3.594,1.688,0.7692,6.9656,2.607,6.3835,0.0063,1.7356,2.7085,0.3151,5.7334,4.5013,0.0004,3.5842,5.0989,0.7406,0.5912,0.5076,0.1826,0.2361,4.2765,1.8075,3.327,0.0218,7.161,1.7231,5.3945,3.3546,3.7148,8.2434,1.6933,1.5806,3.9625,2.5483,2.8189,2.4557,3.4925,1.24,0.0162,5.1817,5.5582,0.6457,2.7854,1.7441,2.9688,1.9112,4.5155,3.4987,2.1163,1.5417,0.322,5.1829,8.3005,2.0572,0.0003,4.5329,7.1518,2.1727,2.5372,1.1825,2.5651,6.2459,1.8554,0.8562,2.3102,0.5991,0.0014,2.5427,1.5688,4.5612,1.2307,0.1582,6.0924,4.6559,5.7458,2.4377,1.347,3.9408,3.4811,7.076,0.0412,1.0169,4.9681,2.5805,0.0298,0.7139,4.6112,3.2712,2.6413,6.5196,6.7429,5.1845,4.2066,5.9554,0.3359,3.8433,3.0277,3.5363,3.8914,4.3657,2.4284,1.1228,5.295,3.5506,1.546,1.0543,5.4738,5.0617,4.4795,2.7208,0.6892,6.7081,1.3303,0.0221,5.7568,0.5344,2.6904,0.8451,2.7991,5.4517,2.8974,2.7935,0.5871,3.2488,0.686,0.0871,1.0002,3.1305,6.897,1.1358,4.4805,3.3098,0.2309,0.5055,4.7865,0.3542,2.2034,0.0002,5.0946,0.0033,1.8377,7.0082,2.4323,1.3243,4.8342,3.3817,1.2099,2.9809,2.5853,1.4073,0.2777,7.3345,3.9737,5.7766,0.4452,1.0296,0.7857,1.6674,0.7513,2.5262,1.208,4.1092,2.9183,3.5025,1.7015,4.1905,0.0475,3.5468,1.0889,0.598,3.4486,2.7301,7.7204,0.9894,1.7885,0.6176,2.617,0.5448,0.4358,0.0876,3.3278,3.6438,4.5996,0.054,0.0038,0.9349,8.3951,0.5246,0.8587,2.7139,4.0779,2.0411,1.5487,5.3453,1.7869,0.405,0.1632,3.3025,2.8981,4.8881,0.9345,6.4779,0.4455,1.8842,0.8697,2.1635,6.4251,0.143,0.9399,4.5425,0.081,1.4524,1.5188,1.1192,1.0582,3.0603,0.0442,3.0722,0.1607,1.539,4.4172,2.2566,1.7763,5.5014,6.0519,1.1598,1.6932,0.4451,0.2837,2.6208,1.1681,2.8472,0.3465,1.7111,3.3769,0.6658,5.9168,1.4852,2.5103,3.2547,0.5368,3.1129,0.0567,0.5487,0.2819,1.0363,4.0454,4.9434,0.0004,5.9722,0.0265,2.2084,4.7377,2.841,6.0726,0.4783,3.7493,4.9395,9.0239,4.1782,1.2829,2.3989,3.3412,4.2035,7.3439,3.9869,7.2578,7.5051,7.0353,4.5668,5.2041,0.0692,0.9826,0.3934,0.0001,3.8827,6.4327,0.0488,9.407,7.7478,3.998,2.0765,8.8815,9.8188,6.7144,1.8556,5.9985,2.9579,4.3617,3.0268,3.1641,0.0104,0.1351,1.8463,6.1617,0.5914,4.2499,7.7939,3.21,6.1469,1.7394,0.8527,0.1127,5.1457,0.0006,2.0124,2.3143,5.0035,5.23,2.2071,0.0001,6.9024,1.7367,6.2,3.645,0.1306,5.4302,6.5615,7.5921,1.1332,5.197,0.0016,1.0881,0.0002,6.2277,0.0868,3.1623,4.0043]}
{"id":552,"ended":true,"length":308,"text":"To perform in vitro analysis, a protein must be purified away from other cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell's membrane is disrupted and its contents are released into the surrounding culture medium. Although protein expression can be induced by cell lysis, it is rarely desirable, particularly for screening purposes. This section explores methods for enhancing the secretion of recombinant proteins by mammalian cells.\n\nBacterial secreted proteins are often modified with cysteine residues to improve their solubility in solution. These modifications are particularly important when these proteins will be used for protein purification.\n\nIt is commonly believed that cell lysis induces secretion because it disturbs the normal concentration gradient between the cytoplasm and the periplasm and therefore reduces the osmotic pressure at entry to the cell's intracellular compartment.\n\nThis page provides useful content and local businesses that can help with your search for L-Glycyrrhetinic acid (EGY-105).

{"id":629,"ended":true,"length":343,"text":"The Miami Hurricanes entered the Peach Bowl with a record @ - @ breaking offense that set the school mark for the most accumulated yards in school history with a total offensive mark of 3,764 on the season. The Hurricanes also broke the single season rushing record in the process, finishing off the year with 1,038 attempts for 2,743 yards.\n\nThat offense was built around four talented running backs in Jaylinn Hawkins, Duke Johnson, Travis Homer and Myles Jack. Unfortunately, those four backs were the only Hurricanes this season that averaged more than one yard per carry on the season. In fact, Miami only had four running backs on the depth chart that averaged more than three yards per carry.\n\nWith that said, in the game against the North Carolina Tar Heels, those four combined for only 56 yards on 24 carries and three rushes for zero yards. Most of the yards were scored by the Tar Heels on defensive turnovers that accounted for an astronomical 246 yards and three touchdowns in the Orange Bowl.\n\nAs a result, Miami has lost its leading rusher for the third time in as many seasons in Johnson. As for the other three backs, their combined efforts don\u2019t give much reason to expect much, either.\n\nSo what does this mean for this weeks opponent, the Alabama Crimson Tide? Well, I think the answer to that would be simple as well. Because at least one back is expected to get 100+ yards out of this ground game, and they will likely get it from either Jaylen Waddle or Bo Scarbrough.\n\nScarbrough had himself a strong game against the Tennessee Vols a game ago by hauling in seven receptions for 130 yards and one touchdown. He is expected to have a major role in the Crimson Tide ground game on Monday and it will be hard to completely neutralize him.","token_len":378,"entropy":[10.0055,3.9108,5.8535,0.6638,11.4028,0.0754,1.4807,0.8071,3.0399,14.7079,8.3025,9.9463,13.5203,11.394,3.2962,6.165,1.2335,2.2725,6.3564,0.868,1.89,1.3393,10.2536,2.3858,1.3602,3.8676,0.0165,3.9408,3.9929,2.461,6.3182,7.0341,0.0892,3.9237,0.0783,3.9006,3.5196,4.5684,1.2627,0.472,0.4192,1.4947,1.4299,2.3332,4.771,0.9414,4.4003,2.1534,3.5086,0.4186,3.4463,1.8952,3.3065,1.6572,3.9668,5.2228,0.8343,2.3661,0.4198,2.5724,0.0039,5.1228,2.4648,7.6058,2.4757,2.5512,0.0057,3.5509,3.637,0.0613,1.3124,1.5821,0.0006,6.2166,6.8124,1.8377,3.8502,0.7212,4.2015,5.6182,2.252,0.0595,2.9456,5.8097,5.8745,10.1119,6.4047,0.6168,6.8102,1.1712,0.287,6.6601,9.2709,0.7988,6.5584,0.2815,2.3114,0.7113,7.0556,0.89,3.8389,1.1433,2.1643,1.342,4.0784,1.4243,6.335,6.6973,0.4923,3.1324,3.4914,0.9961,0.0674,4.1131,1.7817,0.2086,0.1537,2.8705,0.7237,2.4476,0.4362,3.3612,1.0697,0.0105,3.0068,4.0022,1.8438,2.3497,1.0217,0.0332,2.7241,0.3524,4.6827,0.0042,2.938,1.3645,0.285,0.0046,2.5909,0.1859,0.1275,0.024,1.0562,0.7516,0.0002,3.1992,2.0213,1.8562,0.0136,5.0384,1.3538,5.3301,1.7739,1.0499,5.8325,0.1497,0.1704,0.0032,0.0014,0.3051,5.8873,0.6951,4.3011,0.6245,3.0494,6.8411,0.8584,1.4938,4.817,0.0172,2.4789,4.1178,4.8186,2.0093,4.3389,0.2358,0.3669,7.0155,0.9017,1.618,6.4529,2.2331,4.1648,1.0258,1.8139,3.929,0.0051,0.0112,3.5588,5.8981,8.2522,2.9499,7.1906,0.004,4.1576,7.6198,8.7288,1.1096,2.6259,2.3915,0.9518,3.3117,0.5688,5.1447,0.2233,0.4387,0.4792,0.0001,3.9803,1.6266,0.6133,0.4599,1.1697,2.7641,3.2981,3.2876,5.2474,0.2495,3.2975,0.297,4.7258,1.8536,0.5313,3.4949,0.0359,1.7619,3.2765,8.92,4.298,4.2228,4.1994,1.8394,1.9862,1.8065,2.0992,0.7128,3.7617,1.5515,7.6911,7.504,15.5404,7.9332,0.628,4.5909,3.1793,3.6375,0.5173,4.042,2.9961,5.3146,3.5878,0.1226,0.7729,0.0002,4.848,1.6007,1.9015,1.2493,0.6355,0.1111,4.0605,10.6915,5.4046,3.5246,2.3128,6.1746,0.046,0.0004,0.2259,2.4711,0.0607,4.0219,2.3376,2.0287,3.0632,1.6661,0.3177,4.16,0.355,3.7259,5.6009,1.814,0.2454,5.3158,4.5119,1.6352,1.6939,7.1443,1.9598,3.6768,0.0608,3.1863,5.5779,1.4206,0.7689,6.1131,0.0165,1.8112,9.5464,0.1485,1.6642,1.4225,4.731,1.9553,4.2052,3.002,1.7848,3.044,4.4349,5.9485,4.222,6.1724,5.9968,0.3534,7.4664,2.9842,0.1687,0.0034,0.4604,0.7921,0.0002,6.59,0.7468,0.0038,3.5601,8.2025,0.6758,4.1208,1.2811,1.2279,0.7945,5.4047,6.0502,0.0027,5.7983,6.639,0.287,6.0072,7.3898,0.0365,0.1619,4.4764,2.1335,0.2749,4.6838,0.0329,1.0291,1.812,0.4059,0.5916,1.9829,2.9198,2.6255,0.0208,3.3125,1.2111,5.3334,1.117,0.7072,1.3582,4.1048,0.0116,10.0595,0.017,4.6076,3.0647,3.2014,3.8039,1.4855,0.5214,3.7379,0.32,8.8269,6.714,0.0045,1.6969,1.1567]}

With all those creatures combined, ``Every one of his names was written on every creature,`` and with the whole creation singing out the creation Song that God provided, ``We sang praises to You, and You heard our prayers,`` God knew that there would be pain and suffering in the world.

{"id":1575,"ended":true,"length":333,"text":"A tropical wave came off the coast of Africa into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on June 10 and 11. The system moved across the Atlantic and entered into the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The system has not significantly organized, but convection associated with the system has been increasing in coverage, and a large area of showers and thunderstorms has been located about 500 miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands.\n\nThe system is expected to move northward across the eastern portion of the tropical Atlantic during the next couple of days. A stronger tropical Atlantic disturbance is expected to become more organized and move into the southwestern and southwestern Caribbean Sea later Friday and Saturday. Thereafter, the two disturbances are expected to remain in relatively close proximity through Sunday.\n\nSatellite imagery has shown that the two cyclones have grown to nearly identical strength. An atmospheric surface pressure measurement has been made over the Cabo Verde Islands, but a measurement from a surface site indicates that the pressure has fallen to 1035 mb (29.69 inHg). A strong tropical storm would have a pressure of 1003 mb (29.79 inHg).\n\nThe official NHC predictions for these two weather systems, as indicated on the graphics, are as follows: the second tropical disturbance may become a tropical depression early next week while the first one will move further northward in the western tropical Atlantic. Tropical cyclone outlooks for both systems are available from the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\nThe European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has also issued an advisory on these two systems. ECMWF is the European branch of the World-Wide Weather-Watch program.\n\nCurrent information indicates that these two weather systems could eventually combine to become a tropical cyclone in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean. Further intensification of both systems is possible while they remain in proximity.","token_len":378,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,6.3837,6.0729,0.7908,0.6914,0.1123,5.1013,6.2068,0.864,4.4241,3.0354,1.4413,1.9874,3.6129,3.4616,3.047,6.1744,0.8958,1.7053,7.4338,5.5054,4.1287,0.4778,0.9447,2.415,6.2423,5.2188,0.4923,6.6092,0.6183,0.822,1.1455,1.7233,4.1695,3.1949,3.2314,7.9518,12.7309,2.454,1.0868,10.3259,0.8501,8.5464,0.1041,1.1596,2.8307,1.4253,1.3153,4.5543,2.291,8.9102,2.7248,2.1338,3.8409,3.2134,3.3623,0.5811,10.976,2.2201,3.5939,0.0597,1.2512,0.8378,5.6018,5.7744,3.6564,0.7639,2.7659,0.0981,1.1861,10.6627,0.3202,1.6713,0.0043,1.9808,0.5875,1.2307,0.0007,1.522,3.0308,1.1994,3.2271,0.0064,3.1242,2.6144,0.6285,3.9346,0.3251,3.4392,5.1054,0.003,0.3221,4.4485,2.3329,4.4182,0.6358,0.9332,3.2715,0.1144,0.8187,0.9162,3.6315,6.0455,2.0358,7.7798,6.2196,1.8533,0.2708,1.537,4.6259,1.475,10.5987,2.058,4.9866,2.6527,0.2689,4.0897,3.559,3.7231,4.7021,3.462,4.8395,5.8904,1.6376,0.1631,0.5664,5.3091,5.6256,0.2443,1.0304,6.9787,7.0914,2.3817,0.3315,0.0104,5.0278,1.8721,5.6844,3.0793,0.2125,5.0846,1.5558,0.7137,0.4248,0.0002,5.4335,1.6159,1.2992,3.6711,1.0755,1.4469,0.7697,5.7129,4.8621,0.2477,2.2555,5.5558,2.3872,4.7832,6.633,2.3847,1.7799,5.8714,5.3553,6.7875,3.5878,5.9512,3.4573,2.2629,1.1165,4.165,0.5713,6.7994,0.0153,0.0031,0.003,0.3559,1.4701,2.1424,3.8891,5.0894,2.4312,1.8878,5.2297,6.2614,4.5685,0.485,0.6441,5.8629,1.9713,4.3567,1.0891,5.6489,7.2315,4.3413,2.0068,1.9286,5.9282,1.9981,6.4508,3.3004,12.2154,0.4559,0.8713,2.9745,4.1146,0.9861,1.2437,4.7839,2.6216,2.7777,7.1303,0.3927,5.0488,5.881,0.1876,0.0043,0.1277,3.7645,0.082,4.3889,0.0738,0.0146,0.0013,1.0676,0.8278,0.0003,1.4903,7.9071,5.5104,1.8031,7.7481,1.2169,5.1183,2.0348,6.5674,1.5364,3.5655,2.4708,4.2627,2.8308,0.6514,7.5083,1.2415,0.9597,2.768,0.0799,0.1266,6.0009,5.7236,2.746,5.2391,4.4226,3.2002,2.2083,1.2826,4.5628,5.1535,2.2247,0.2057,5.0194,0.2501,1.401,3.2324,2.2221,2.151,5.2452,1.2012,1.8426,2.4888,0.6859,3.7683,3.3561,2.0247,1.1924,3.8069,2.4146,1.5526,8.2758,0.8318,1.3839,2.5548,1.3636,0.8268,4.7344,2.2405,0.9103,2.1357,0.3355,0.0061,2.8149,3.2048,0.862,0.4964,0.0002,2.4036,7.8024,3.8173,0.0287,2.9838,3.4333,0.1956,1.8026,0.3782,1.2557,0.6005,0.1765,0.0101,0.1541,2.0319,3.8971,1.8127,2.9178,1.9499,3.2855,5.6907,0.9475,2.2488,1.0963,3.4985,0.0145,0.0002,2.6114,2.2477,2.8739,8.0918,0.02,0.4394,3.9513,12.3544,0.3218,4.0556,10.4526,6.3243,5.2573,1.1396,1.4445,0.0002,6.6259,4.5828,4.9394,0.152,4.1273,0.8288,3.956,0.0641,3.8915,5.0545,4.1386,0.7443,3.0489,0.9034,0.3872,4.406,0.0073,2.8894,0.5263,3.1152,1.3522,0.1709,2.6057,0.7732,6.4305,7.5548,0.1547,0.4413,5.4512,0.7549,2.174,2.689,5.9666,2.7259,2.643,0.898,3.6981,0.8192]}

The only way to break the curse was for a powerful princess who has the power to do so to marry the handsome prince. The kingdom of Neverland was ruled by a Queen named Regina Mills, but the people always doubted that she was in fact the mother of the beloved prince, Prince James. That\u2019s because there was no proof that he actually existed. So when Queen Regina married and then lost their son, Prince Henry, to a hunting accident, it\u2019s her evil brother, Rumpelstiltskin, who is secretly behind the curse and who is using the Queen\u2019s own magic tiara to keep it in place. On the other side, the story of the town of Storybrooke is one of redemption and true love.

{"id":4754,"ended":true,"length":346,"text":"The final race of the season was run in conditions that were never quite wet enough for drivers to use wet tyres, but never quite dry enough for slick tyres to provide enough grip either. Pirelli brought new low range wet tyres to the race to be used when the rain intensified, but it never quite did. Instead, Vettel chose to stop with the intermediate tyres on and was the only driver to do so for those stints; the others all running with the slicks.\n\nBut, as the race progressed, the rain intensified and became very heavy. This led to a number of spins, including one for Bottas due to a loose tyre as he slowed to turn into the pits (he was later declared the winner of the race).\n\nFor a brief few laps on lap 44, Vettel briefly appeared on the softs alongside poleman Daniel Ricciardo, with P\u00e9rez third and Ricciardo's Red Bull fourth.\n\n\"It is too early and too late in the race to have a proper look,\" said Vettel. \"The first stint was OK and we were quite close with Daniel [Ricciardo]. But then when it went green everything got chaotic.\"\n\n\"We didn\u2019t run in wet conditions here and we didn\u2019t know the car could do it,\" Hamilton told SkySports. \"It was tricky out there and I came down the pits and the rear of my car lifted a little out of control when I came to turn in so I got a bit of a scare for a moment.\n\n\"It looked like Bottas had a huge spin and that was unfortunate, then a few laps later [Sergio] P\u00e9rez spun and I thought: oh f***, this rain is too much. It\u2019s been a long year and I\u2019m physically tired.","token_len":378,"entropy":[7.1861,6.9383,1.6443,0.3046,1.3905,2.7155,6.7966,2.0743,8.8469,1.2619,1.8471,5.6129,3.7704,7.2613,1.5694,1.1165,4.3284,0.482,4.4574,6.5076,0.4657,1.6861,1.7187,6.176,1.6376,2.0797,0.0156,0.6759,8.75,0.4379,2.0448,5.0111,3.0175,1.135,7.9488,0.2534,7.2331,0.9533,0.0024,6.5391,4.7815,6.9114,9.0297,7.0625,0.3083,0.8864,0.864,2.8046,2.9666,5.1453,0.9677,4.2551,1.5835,3.8032,7.0749,1.572,1.1797,2.7724,3.3565,2.6471,2.9966,1.2643,5.6332,0.457,7.5278,0.0716,6.5108,0.583,6.2845,4.6639,1.9979,8.0565,1.482,3.4233,5.2874,5.1753,5.036,1.2436,1.115,0.863,3.5022,0.0509,3.1447,6.6165,7.1453,0.007,6.4676,2.2808,4.0998,4.2858,8.7466,2.8792,1.5272,7.7127,0.0001,1.6727,0.8001,0.0062,4.941,3.6484,1.9324,2.1408,1.6026,1.0862,0.2299,1.5085,3.2218,4.3511,1.144,5.6956,4.4603,4.0219,1.1288,3.9709,2.6342,0.1118,1.4009,3.7222,0.0009,9.1586,1.8101,2.7209,1.6145,4.0852,4.828,0.0004,7.3013,0.0125,1.0867,3.9337,1.2678,5.7358,0.9707,5.3896,1.7283,5.3209,3.3442,0.7646,1.9168,5.3348,2.7612,1.7267,4.3307,5.1081,2.6529,0.5079,2.08,0.2749,0.2188,0.6879,1.6378,0.0001,4.9273,2.7799,4.0606,5.3269,0.7379,3.5582,1.7169,5.8976,0.3769,1.6845,0.0034,6.6013,5.2195,3.4816,0.4355,8.6174,4.4807,7.1585,10.0388,6.8535,3.4259,0.0084,0.0001,0.0,1.0028,3.7791,5.1211,4.8751,0.0192,8.8633,2.4687,2.5972,0.024,0.0014,5.4312,5.8886,0.0231,5.5616,0.8239,2.6907,0.0001,3.5795,1.8815,3.4893,5.3035,1.3377,6.413,2.511,2.5312,3.9141,0.3695,0.7398,1.1451,4.3842,1.9776,4.169,5.7938,4.012,1.2913,1.6069,0.0139,0.6897,0.2304,2.6613,3.7722,4.0214,1.0517,5.4266,2.269,2.3105,2.0724,4.677,2.632,3.7795,4.2386,3.0268,0.4943,0.0371,0.0012,0.0019,1.8531,1.9405,2.5348,4.3417,2.918,4.159,7.2606,7.5639,3.172,7.0446,2.9577,0.0486,0.0001,2.2344,2.1116,3.3114,16.4347,7.8762,0.8029,4.7977,3.7341,3.7362,0.5466,6.1244,2.1166,1.7345,2.0913,0.2769,0.0467,0.0114,4.7495,4.1288,3.7221,4.826,2.6998,1.0684,2.1673,8.2274,3.847,3.3637,6.9531,0.8368,1.424,1.9236,0.5644,5.3722,6.3968,0.4021,1.9051,2.2335,5.9669,2.9281,3.9926,2.2494,1.7793,3.1634,6.1538,2.2363,2.3941,0.1856,9.9108,2.8425,1.0207,6.4247,0.4848,2.538,5.143,0.9237,2.6883,2.4309,3.6607,3.4638,6.2615,0.9363,3.264,2.2623,2.649,2.0654,0.6731,4.5249,4.9662,0.8424,3.1642,1.1375,1.0807,0.0002,0.0367,2.2929,4.0626,0.443,6.4908,0.001,1.804,1.6734,5.7554,4.7426,1.8715,3.1703,1.1127,5.9946,2.1054,5.9023,4.0783,2.8347,1.0437,0.0776,4.8952,4.4677,0.808,0.1399,0.1771,4.923,0.9344,0.0008,5.2626,2.6232,2.6614,3.8305,4.0362,4.9982,7.0839,0.9739,1.6889,2.6946,10.3368,0.9615,4.0049,0.8816,1.4151,2.306,6.2041,0.1123,0.3137,5.0979,1.7011,1.8125,4.5218,1.3269,1.1623,4.8248,0.0778,0.2248,10.5256,2.7035,1.4462]}

Since the title character has no connection with that part of the history, a novel about the military achievements of Bol\u00edvar would hardly be called by the name of its hero, and the author could have left the hero s name out of it.","token_len":378,"entropy":[8.639,6.8559,1.2586,0.812,3.5168,0.9385,13.2106,7.9985,7.8913,5.4658,2.6489,5.6805,3.1154,1.9165,2.6715,8.7632,0.147,1.7762,1.0047,12.4448,0.1837,2.8015,0.246,0.0203,0.002,7.8929,5.2765,6.6934,2.3908,3.9307,1.4881,11.9202,0.4221,0.6828,0.1575,0.0003,0.8943,1.7067,5.7631,8.459,1.0475,3.3096,1.7598,9.2413,5.914,0.2865,4.4077,1.0354,3.1538,1.5215,1.4419,4.7878,4.4437,0.0026,0.381,0.0164,0.0034,0.0007,6.4221,4.9884,0.0007,0.0018,10.1746,7.0724,0.7203,0.8333,6.1232,3.0271,0.6186,6.8793,4.6158,0.0358,13.6515,2.4049,4.1171,2.2464,3.017,2.5071,1.6646,2.6884,6.6341,1.7731,7.8919,4.5023,0.9813,3.4073,4.9742,2.4934,0.6855,0.664,3.913,0.0059,0.5608,0.0018,0.0012,4.7137,4.021,0.8408,2.4269,7.5953,4.0188,0.7173,4.3814,1.7683,3.9627,1.4387,4.3557,1.3211,8.2107,2.0937,0.0063,2.1823,2.5703,4.0947,4.2587,4.8125,0.1665,0.0341,1.7162,4.8656,0.5476,1.1132,0.4756,8.5877,0.4575,2.1572,4.9121,4.2357,0.0444,0.0057,0.0006,1.1878,4.1597,3.3652,0.0831,0.8235,5.4517,2.6044,5.8676,6.3971,2.1684,1.1452,6.7736,1.9783,3.3716,0.5611,7.5301,0.7842,4.5286,4.5068,0.6512,2.8661,5.3703,0.9925,2.7867,2.9686,1.0036,3.8626,1.1737,6.4779,3.1973,5.173,3.2825,5.8923,0.9465,0.0095,7.0287,1.6826,2.3969,3.7939,1.6766,1.2864,6.6814,9.7514,4.3406,2.8207,8.8897,1.2282,1.8446,1.1205,1.0411,5.0365,1.1636,4.3912,2.4558,2.5085,0.3605,2.6395,2.663,2.0447,4.0842,0.0488,3.6776,0.3715,2.4788,1.3451,2.784,2.0541,4.3679,1.3425,5.1227,9.1785,2.9924,2.3662,0.2986,10.615,0.6918,0.0135,0.2546,2.7757,2.9894,1.0078,3.9826,4.1279,7.3431,0.1737,1.4739,4.4162,0.3258,6.2624,2.6027,4.0036,5.8013,0.0487,1.121,5.1485,9.4836,0.3213,0.0169,2.1778,4.5621,1.734,6.7145,0.393,1.8798,3.3533,5.7502,1.4507,1.7939,6.0885,2.255,0.8168,4.6001,5.8582,0.0065,5.9946,2.7715,5.9318,0.0223,5.2862,3.0021,1.9778,1.9106,2.3489,1.824,9.964,2.009,4.191,7.0611,0.0449,8.6722,0.1437,5.7321,1.2932,5.1182,0.0002,7.074,4.675,1.6994,0.0002,2.9996,2.1693,10.3385,2.4807,5.5739,1.5065,4.5996,4.8012,1.0775,4.8962,0.0775,1.5865,3.8277,1.5672,2.8006,3.6423,1.3268,6.7609,5.4529,6.2341,4.1359,0.3797,5.6062,1.0006,4.0309,2.1059,1.7851,0.1744,5.9626,3.4419,9.3749,4.9282,0.3715,0.0469,1.9619,4.9584,0.6475,3.35,0.7095,2.9679,3.3414,5.9926,0.588,5.7498,0.435,2.3025,2.6968,4.3335,5.0194,0.8967,5.3883,4.3459,0.877,1.0694,7.4598,5.2974,5.2082,0.5785,5.877,1.0824,3.7488,4.46,3.3148,1.3673,4.0261,1.245,5.3205,6.6846,0.0434,0.3504,2.9534,1.8217,4.4132,4.9204,2.8873,1.173,4.476,6.3417,0.1054,3.2947,0.0167,0.0019,2.808,5.3911,0.7741,4.7249,6.4423,1.3587,2.718,0.517,4.9849,3.9168,1.6042,2.5107,1.8248,2.4555,2.8281,2.0331,5.1366,1.5602,6.5226,9.2299,0.9304,1.9592,0.4131,3.2067,0.7346]}
{"id":2096,"ended":true,"length":347,"text":"Bol\u00edvar's fate is known from the beginning, and Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez constantly uses images which foreshadow this ending. For instance, a clock stuck at seven minutes past one, the exact time of the coup on television screens. Garcia M\u00e1rquez also includes three chapters in the book, written by his characters, which foreshadow the coup and events in the novel, the first is an account of Rambla's reaction on hearing of the coup; the second begins with Elizardo reading a newspaper which includes a description of the events, the exact same description of these events is seen in chapter five on and on. In chapter ten, one can see a map of Nicaragua printed on a newspaper, which matches the map on page sixty five. This is the first time that the map is actually illustrated on the pages to help people identify its position. The other example is Garcia M\u00e1rquez using symbols to represent a scene in the book. He first does this in chapter seven, on the first page and then again in chapter nine. These symbols include a triangle, a circle and a rectangle all of which fit into the same space. The first use is where Salvador, a character in the book, goes back and forth between two countries. Both countries are the exact same as each other. The second one where this is shown is when Rambla and Diamante come to visit Salvador in the country where he is living. The final use is at the end of the story when Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez uses symbols of four letters, which represent the countries of Colombia and Venezuela, which are very close to each other geographically. This also foreshadows the end of the country names. There is also the fact that these letters are the beginning and the end of each country, this foreshadows the situation at the end of the story too.","token_len":378,"entropy":[7.359,9.0202,1.1413,2.3511,6.6513,1.7162,5.2307,4.1076,1.2655,3.3395,1.5991,1.6163,10.5059,0.0469,2.7418,0.0263,0.0129,0.0007,9.9645,4.8,7.8971,5.9287,8.144,0.8311,4.8765,5.4977,0.7201,3.8919,1.2922,0.1305,3.992,8.9249,7.3622,3.2171,6.3882,3.7155,4.0646,4.2499,3.8004,3.1435,5.7403,0.7801,2.0273,1.0127,6.6701,5.0003,9.17,5.5944,1.9522,7.0346,0.126,0.0098,0.0012,0.0007,2.9062,6.6264,5.3568,8.4566,1.7981,1.471,1.8471,1.3138,5.881,0.8718,3.3289,7.9195,1.3253,1.5629,4.2615,0.2496,0.726,3.2136,2.3945,6.6366,2.4591,0.9127,3.1558,2.1659,3.9083,3.5596,5.6935,3.8769,3.1685,0.1401,8.2585,8.0751,1.3113,0.9139,6.7442,4.6842,5.5994,2.0121,0.6344,0.8601,4.708,0.4264,0.3193,6.573,0.8876,6.9777,9.6651,3.1817,5.8949,1.5805,3.1695,3.7218,6.7536,1.3226,4.4787,0.0398,0.7477,3.2387,2.5322,1.5659,8.6771,5.0843,4.7595,1.9478,7.1815,0.1156,3.4527,4.2276,0.3045,6.3055,3.3332,4.6908,6.2367,3.1076,0.7981,2.7075,2.0524,2.8628,0.6471,5.1771,4.7804,0.671,2.5898,4.8143,0.6042,7.4199,7.3779,1.108,1.1372,3.5366,1.8229,1.5496,8.0724,0.5891,2.2064,2.8244,3.486,5.826,4.3082,1.3227,3.16,1.5738,1.5645,2.366,0.558,1.1268,1.6717,3.0921,1.3146,4.0417,5.894,2.2345,1.0705,4.3451,6.3841,5.0364,3.9589,4.6891,5.733,4.9694,0.9591,2.1472,3.7909,5.4844,0.9218,4.5892,0.0794,0.0111,0.0014,0.0007,4.9154,6.5246,1.5331,2.1372,2.8229,5.8558,1.5314,1.1222,2.0735,1.9832,3.4036,5.3243,5.1548,0.4508,1.3465,0.4852,3.0831,0.7262,5.1326,1.3964,4.1014,1.6576,4.3471,1.0037,3.3035,0.351,0.3182,2.5272,0.9782,4.0556,1.1528,5.4179,1.8725,4.4632,1.0965,0.6677,2.2193,1.6785,0.3814,4.6059,6.9666,2.1759,0.0971,6.8718,2.2864,0.9891,1.5836,2.7346,1.2171,1.7612,3.2835,6.927,3.8005,5.3505,7.5572,4.8996,2.172,4.4652,1.1284,0.2978,1.0723,0.2592,5.1496,4.7613,2.3187,0.9155,0.9287,2.4065,5.9432,1.8051,6.3168,1.8039,1.0925,4.3778,6.5298,0.1879,4.8087,5.6522,0.0206,1.4013,1.6212,1.6761,5.2389,5.1959,5.2458,1.6742,2.1894,0.9022,3.7811,4.4404,0.0141,0.0021,3.3667,6.4848,5.3266,0.7009,3.5549,0.4721,2.576,2.5551,2.8357,1.7356,4.0489,2.7494,1.4181,1.6403,2.4672,0.6119,1.8781,4.7017,1.3974,0.8237,5.0038,0.6221,0.5461,0.8091,2.3047,3.8723,1.6092,4.585,0.0078,0.0628,0.0062,0.0013,0.0009,3.3902,3.3549,3.6746,6.5577,5.1893,2.029,2.1125,2.6745,1.1227,5.6014,1.1951,3.6178,1.251,2.742,1.6406,2.4871,1.0965,4.9912,2.0049,0.9787,0.2482,0.0065,8.3556,0.4096,2.408,4.3762,3.515,0.9995,0.0006,0.4241,3.5681,0.1665,0.2751,8.5753,6.5885,1.5894,4.3219,1.0753,1.3268,2.4325,3.3137,0.0586,4.0351,3.7185,0.9862,3.7626,5.297,2.3169,1.5528,0.2535,0.1374,3.5924,1.1222,1.8517,5.1875,2.6903,0.1076,0.0006,0.4801,6.2411,3.7654,0.3002,1.1449,0.2902,0.2516,2.9989,7.25,0.2452]}

{"id":3887,"ended":true,"length":327,"text":"Based on studies using morphology, immunology, repetitive DNA, SINE analysis, multilocus phylogenetic tests, and mitochondrial genes ( mtDNA ), giant mouse lemurs are most closely related to mouse lemurs, and not to tarsiers, as they once thought. Giant mouse lemurs, including Pteropus, have long been classified as belonging to the sub- family (Subfamily Certhioninae ) of the Lemuridae, a primate family ( Primates ). The largest species has a tail around 40 cm ( 16 in ) in length and weighs up to 9 kg (20 lb ). The body of the giant mouse lemur is relatively narrow, and only two fingers are used for grasping. Giant mouse lemurs use their four toes to climb and walk and are adept at traversing rough surfaces. Despite its size, its powerful tail is used for swinging, grasping, and protection. Most species live a typical nocturnal life, though more than a dozen species are active during the day and several species can be diurnal. Most species range in length from 13.8-18.2 cm (5.4-7 in ). Giant mouse lemurs have fur that varies in color from orange to yellow brown to black and is always much lighter in color than the rest of the animal where it is thickest, particularly along the back where it may cover as much as 2\/3 of the animal. Giant mouse lemurs use their four fingers to grasp items as they climb up tree trunks and branches. Like other lemurs, they also have curved teeth. They typically bury their favorite foods in the ground to eat them later or during travel between feeding locations. They eat leaves from the canopy of trees. They are also herbivores and eat insects and small lizards. They also consume fruit, flowers and buds.","token_len":379,"entropy":[3.4399,7.2534,4.6007,10.4004,1.4396,6.9464,1.3421,0.3261,11.2273,2.9304,2.1819,8.5249,6.2235,3.9039,0.3589,7.0317,2.0354,0.3473,6.0126,0.9153,7.1115,0.384,0.6056,5.559,5.6038,2.7316,12.3439,0.0163,1.8683,11.2917,4.5878,6.9474,1.8936,0.0072,1.6623,4.4404,1.9627,0.1918,0.072,4.8528,3.6135,0.0974,0.0096,1.8626,1.7996,6.3516,0.739,6.2356,3.4418,1.9957,1.9499,2.8202,2.7091,7.7553,6.638,0.3124,6.2059,0.9827,0.1711,0.0203,0.0081,2.9288,4.1317,6.3069,2.7263,1.5035,3.9454,3.2814,3.3044,0.527,5.3719,0.3369,5.6215,0.0519,0.8856,3.9788,2.7931,8.8705,2.5198,7.1221,1.5559,8.8819,6.7975,8.1766,3.8328,0.1232,3.8318,1.1072,2.1026,7.1577,0.3616,0.4835,1.3263,3.2144,6.7871,0.0081,2.5699,4.4097,8.6455,0.9879,2.2655,2.0809,4.7058,4.1243,5.4229,2.3427,6.1931,8.5235,4.6138,0.7181,1.4435,7.3694,0.9028,1.4405,2.5534,0.064,1.3387,3.0244,3.4735,0.0037,4.4761,1.079,0.1436,5.1869,0.7941,3.5226,1.7672,4.5912,3.0942,0.863,1.4084,0.4715,0.4848,1.3345,0.5675,4.5273,4.2573,1.0666,2.0859,4.0437,3.7192,5.475,1.1756,3.8915,1.1292,1.8236,1.4676,2.1278,0.7246,0.026,0.1254,0.0067,5.0931,1.7713,6.6125,1.8918,0.9208,4.5544,2.4728,3.9364,3.3993,2.5195,6.0975,0.2886,7.2441,0.001,4.408,1.4961,1.0538,5.1202,2.5867,2.0725,0.3451,4.4014,5.8513,3.4883,1.6039,4.6858,1.6556,6.055,2.2672,5.3446,0.3794,0.4997,8.9667,0.8811,4.7989,4.2353,4.5394,5.3037,4.8723,9.2029,0.0109,0.0008,0.3279,1.2543,3.814,5.574,2.0112,3.2198,1.764,1.0201,2.1741,5.3309,2.4196,0.6359,0.6597,1.7968,4.4016,1.6522,3.2415,0.9415,9.8616,0.0232,1.0024,3.6686,2.1358,6.3082,1.251,2.2493,0.2271,5.3919,2.5367,2.6586,3.8173,2.1646,0.6042,2.507,0.2109,0.3586,2.8346,1.4763,2.2867,0.1952,1.9373,2.9464,2.6995,2.0099,0.8801,0.0189,0.0769,0.0031,1.8843,7.5106,1.9136,3.7543,1.8131,1.0382,0.9473,4.9221,0.2271,2.2327,7.2858,2.353,1.9598,2.736,2.6208,6.1647,6.3625,2.8959,1.4801,0.348,0.4843,2.0005,3.2013,0.1002,0.3719,2.4928,10.1586,1.3936,1.0213,5.8456,4.2729,2.6122,5.4643,5.6207,0.3217,3.0124,4.8806,0.7676,4.7309,4.8643,6.032,0.267,0.2902,3.0172,4.2271,0.1464,0.2435,0.8284,2.4792,1.2621,1.4259,0.5155,0.0153,0.0319,0.0039,4.2951,0.9228,2.7112,3.4294,0.734,2.7145,5.9856,3.9359,1.3814,2.7521,3.2676,4.7315,1.8049,0.0003,1.5149,3.9951,0.8915,5.3907,1.6893,3.5385,0.1829,0.0245,0.1841,1.1277,3.0258,1.52,7.3233,4.08,2.5279,2.772,5.3308,7.2593,0.6763,8.7697,1.7739,1.2137,2.0037,0.7464,3.6296,3.7846,2.9536,3.843,3.7522,3.9164,7.3688,6.4017,7.2041,3.5254,0.3516,2.7988,3.8626,5.5214,3.2259,1.9207,5.769,1.3716,0.5666,2.9863,2.6646,2.1645,2.3854,3.9472,0.0002,0.0442,1.3418,1.9867,2.479,1.5413,3.215,7.9058,0.0246,0.6963,2.5623,2.6186,3.8059,4.5676,1.7262,4.9071,1.8857,7.9709,1.4314]}

The gathering, which later became the congress of 1848 in Dubrovnik, was called by Paja Kragujevi\u0107, a poet, priest and former student of the Jesuit School in Zagreb.\n\nThe first congress delegates, who were all members of various institutions of the Croatian national awakening such as the \"Association for the Croatian Literary Revival\" (Associja za \u010ditava hrvatska razvojna ustanova), organized the national congress. They were also the initiator of the national song contest of 1848 and the first Croatian national newspaper, the \"Croatian Weekly Gazette\" (Croatijski novinar).","token_len":379,"entropy":[3.574,7.4816,3.5052,4.6452,4.7201,1.6464,1.6928,10.3565,0.9512,7.8775,7.9325,0.8777,1.2564,10.9002,1.4114,1.8532,3.1402,2.0306,7.6577,1.8333,5.157,4.6104,5.4174,2.6264,9.9065,1.1572,5.6203,8.6102,2.8667,5.1489,1.4034,1.2883,2.8678,1.1252,1.1908,2.3726,0.1882,2.9551,0.0162,0.4256,0.2309,1.0159,0.0059,4.3396,0.9284,6.0027,0.0311,0.8725,4.5123,0.0253,0.0074,0.0353,0.0033,1.4854,1.5867,3.8092,4.4727,2.5911,0.0056,1.0889,8.0372,5.36,5.483,4.3778,1.2997,7.5724,1.277,0.6966,0.0141,0.0156,3.6726,3.4574,3.6188,3.8471,0.294,4.4933,0.3617,2.0872,6.9102,1.6899,0.8964,1.1813,5.7558,0.0802,5.194,0.0979,2.3549,2.1833,4.4325,0.0137,5.7503,0.3292,2.0625,9.3055,0.0081,0.7216,0.8586,0.3143,2.7617,2.2872,2.8644,0.5319,0.0159,0.0002,0.0002,0.0036,2.0231,3.9721,7.3227,0.0576,0.0343,0.1372,0.1511,8.1041,0.1673,3.2132,0.9467,3.0439,5.1582,1.3133,7.4978,0.9645,2.6843,3.3531,2.2691,2.4912,3.9607,0.4048,0.0268,0.0002,0.0014,0.008,3.8783,1.4644,6.6191,7.8283,0.0003,8.7449,0.2093,5.3527,2.959,5.5204,0.0016,0.0003,0.4929,2.3514,3.6138,6.5999,2.1003,1.3428,0.0002,1.7111,7.214,5.8199,4.0703,2.3018,4.1747,1.6925,1.0767,1.0427,6.6711,8.7704,3.1575,2.0593,6.7442,3.1113,5.4552,2.7516,7.367,4.4228,4.4554,0.5473,4.9981,1.304,7.9907,8.4432,3.6403,1.8975,1.3082,6.2802,0.2092,1.1677,6.4001,0.4535,1.2567,1.5487,0.0002,4.7172,3.4332,3.0893,0.2038,0.5761,0.6311,5.7298,3.8601,0.2338,5.9372,0.2058,0.422,1.9265,4.254,9.0324,3.2226,4.4043,7.4386,2.7126,2.6477,0.4355,0.077,0.0166,1.1584,5.2852,1.656,0.6747,1.8482,4.1777,4.4875,0.6184,0.536,2.2579,4.4108,4.4258,7.5637,1.9696,7.9029,2.2158,10.7152,3.9935,3.488,5.9213,4.8981,2.0961,3.3722,7.188,5.3632,2.8948,0.9191,1.168,4.8722,3.0695,1.2066,7.8181,0.5613,1.8038,8.1888,0.2858,7.3901,0.2639,2.9008,6.015,0.0314,0.0016,0.3222,1.1573,5.1636,1.4372,8.0198,8.1298,5.1393,7.2343,2.0736,0.8857,1.9453,0.1038,0.7366,1.952,6.6759,1.3932,6.8191,0.6074,3.5035,4.6363,0.1602,1.4444,7.0015,4.6064,3.1236,3.7974,0.1309,0.0026,1.2658,0.9365,0.0002,1.3182,3.698,5.1487,9.2898,2.7377,2.6484,1.0711,3.1595,2.403,0.0156,6.0962,5.9345,1.6144,0.7601,1.1664,1.9824,4.8442,6.3569,0.002,0.2955,5.4767,7.172,0.1527,1.8595,1.0621,6.4697,7.8892,4.7591,1.1119,1.2233,6.5022,1.6392,4.0356,3.5768,3.0649,5.1341,1.0867,7.1616,6.7766,11.3724,3.7339,3.6194,1.7905,3.9252,2.4663,6.2966,3.9473,4.0326,5.8872,7.9793,5.9844,2.1594,4.6437,1.9601,3.5704,2.7075,2.2043,3.3718,2.0728,3.1469,2.0748,4.7854,4.3516,0.1514,0.4056,2.418,6.4117,5.6638,3.5554,1.2365,0.4043,2.7279,1.483,1.4093,2.5398,0.6531,6.9144,1.5421,1.8291,2.1867,2.8078,0.0693,1.7054,5.596,5.3152,1.6696,0.3807,1.7668,0.0938,6.3828,6.1216,5.4831,11.9935,4.868,3.712]}

{"id":757,"ended":false,"length":323,"text":"Tintin in the Congo shows Tintin taking part in what Michael Farr described as `` the wholesale and gratuitous slaughter `` of animals ; over the course of the Adventure, Tintin shoots several antelope, takes down a leopard and gores an elephant in a massacre that recalls Tintin the Hatted Man, a comic book villain of the 1930s (or perhaps, the 1950s). Other scenes present Tintin being taunted by wild dogs; escaping lions; running with a giraffe on fire; and, at last, entering the den of a leopard to save the life of his friend, the hunter Sam Boukili.\n\nTintin in the Congo offers only glancing references to Tintin and his team surviving by eating the animals they kill. In one sequence, on the eve of departure, they are told to be at their campsites at 7:00 the next morning by a British expeditionary force. When we first see them again in the Congo, Tintin is cooking in preparation for eating. In another, he and Toulson are trying to find a place to eat that evening, with no success. As for what happened to their party of four, killed and eaten by the leopard and its hyenas, we are told that they were either eaten or killed. ``They went for a walk as usual,`` the narrator concludes.\n\nDuring a final dinner scene at a local camp at Lake Fassilat, as the group eats, members of the Belgian Belgian government are shown watching Tintin on television. As they discuss Tintin, however, the film also reflects that the Congo (like the country in Tintin the Crocodile ) is ruled by whites. In the background of the dinner scene, a newspaper headline declares ``A Congolese Crisis.``","token_len":379,"entropy":[8.0872,5.4939,5.3472,1.9625,9.3259,7.0716,7.5427,0.8852,0.0587,6.873,2.7569,0.0515,5.5633,9.7639,5.2869,3.5439,6.7985,0.0605,11.0118,8.1138,8.6866,5.2477,6.9947,0.0626,1.6113,8.6622,0.379,5.2032,10.1171,7.6506,1.895,1.0299,0.0015,1.455,15.1385,2.0118,2.4877,0.0236,0.0023,6.7063,4.5316,8.7405,0.2585,1.5909,7.0132,4.0177,1.7459,6.3039,0.0164,1.5109,7.4266,3.97,2.8057,0.9139,2.7689,1.8816,6.4542,2.2898,7.7453,5.5637,0.0451,0.0017,7.3511,7.0787,10.395,2.3549,2.3312,3.066,6.9693,2.0688,2.6839,2.9097,0.7,3.0902,0.1654,4.6296,4.7207,4.4926,3.6533,3.3647,3.4381,0.0164,2.0115,5.5226,3.2724,6.4394,1.7543,0.0025,0.0022,4.8491,6.0419,0.3665,0.5361,5.7715,3.5953,3.8731,11.0,8.1982,1.9077,5.3887,4.8232,1.6761,6.0304,0.0361,3.7083,3.982,0.6757,1.0954,2.9128,3.5533,3.3209,0.0523,5.8606,1.4611,7.4068,0.5409,0.9855,4.7054,0.0164,4.7738,4.5031,1.998,2.5316,0.007,2.618,3.4001,1.2757,2.2865,5.9162,6.6446,8.3962,3.8994,8.3539,0.4799,2.4322,0.4452,2.1101,0.2121,0.0019,4.3682,0.8692,1.0039,5.8078,5.535,7.5108,3.3465,6.7416,0.0836,4.6525,0.1792,0.0038,2.6356,1.3835,6.8818,10.2601,5.3389,4.0492,2.2242,2.6978,3.8365,2.4581,0.7135,2.4968,2.2781,3.7229,0.3477,6.1375,0.8632,3.8815,0.0032,9.2361,1.2137,4.7286,1.9389,3.8683,1.7302,4.7603,4.7351,3.0556,5.0662,1.9691,4.081,5.5455,1.0841,1.2334,5.6619,0.769,0.2996,4.4778,1.2753,7.5715,6.8604,2.0166,2.2636,1.7628,3.5266,5.776,3.3774,1.1662,1.0166,5.801,2.2903,0.885,2.9262,0.526,1.8151,0.0083,0.0042,1.4261,8.642,3.6448,6.2826,0.2587,5.5251,3.1218,2.3641,1.3543,2.4585,2.2498,4.0772,4.0456,7.8428,7.0664,1.5053,5.1174,0.0757,3.805,1.053,3.2083,0.6565,1.7695,4.3193,3.8672,1.6822,4.0251,3.4205,2.4836,0.2669,3.8379,4.1657,3.6311,2.8845,0.9743,3.1141,5.7372,3.4914,3.2594,0.6166,8.9273,3.7482,2.8676,0.7364,1.6278,3.9809,0.1059,3.3079,3.2493,7.415,0.3127,0.0034,0.3687,2.0232,2.2899,0.5265,1.1401,1.1588,1.3339,6.3884,3.1779,1.4259,2.4622,1.9398,9.3915,3.3612,4.2394,3.8424,1.5211,3.2214,5.2472,2.6904,1.4539,10.1037,2.6039,2.8138,4.7217,0.6282,1.5877,0.0002,5.5589,2.7658,5.0949,6.4668,2.1112,3.5398,1.9818,4.129,4.1908,4.3262,6.2584,5.9958,7.1001,4.523,5.8624,0.8578,5.6619,1.8517,3.3037,5.0862,1.5141,7.8094,0.0698,0.4878,5.5098,7.2192,4.4983,2.701,2.9582,4.5624,1.9158,0.011,0.0024,4.2316,0.9753,0.7946,3.5425,1.9271,5.2961,3.6082,0.0073,0.0037,2.5461,5.5432,0.0034,1.7854,6.023,5.4431,6.0059,3.1135,1.549,5.5439,6.4695,4.2017,1.417,4.8601,1.9152,4.2134,0.311,0.0021,4.9418,9.2738,2.9436,0.0153,4.6287,0.7681,5.6377,0.0575,8.1919,1.583,2.3891,1.6219,6.3126,1.8669,0.6294,7.87,0.467,0.2243,2.0529,6.7622,2.3157,3.6615,3.4043,4.3933,5.3999,0.0045,0.0002,8.8635,5.1685,4.5692]}

{"id":1720,"ended":true,"length":353,"text":"In late 1943, Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in charge of improving the coastal defences along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion, expected to take place sometime in 1944. The task was considered a relatively easy one. The British First Sea Lord had already ordered the removal of large numbers of guns and personnel from the Normandy beaches. The Americans had largely left their Atlantic Wall defence in the capable hands of Admiral John W. Halsey IV (who had not lost a single American carrier to submarines) and the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN).\n\nRommel and the British General Alan Brooke\n\nThe British Admiralty was aware of Rommel's experience from the North African Campaign and hoped that he might use the knowledge to improve the defences on the Spanish coast. The Allies on the Pacific side meanwhile had left their defences to be improved on a more ad hoc scale by the US Navy. Rommel had little interest in the Spanish Coast as a whole and was much concerned that the defences had not been improved since the war ended. Once he realised that no effort had been made to strengthen the defences since they had been abandoned in 1939, he made a thorough study of the British defences along the coast to form a realistic estimate of the size, nature, and strength of the defences that could be expected. Brooke, the Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East (CINCME) was initially reluctant to commission Rommel, although this appears to have been largely due to the fact that Rommel had served against him in WWI. He was relieved of his command when he fell out with the High Command over the conduct of the Sicily campaign, during which Rommel played a key part. After spending some time in Turkey and Lebanon he returned to Britain and was immediately appointed to replace Major-General David Jones as General Officer Commanding Special Services, later renamed Special Service Force.","token_len":379,"entropy":[7.8253,7.014,0.4502,4.3917,6.8004,9.4117,0.3039,5.0352,1.6813,1.9039,0.0778,0.9509,0.3695,0.0361,9.4477,0.7774,9.0162,1.3824,4.1639,0.1298,5.3041,9.5868,3.0908,5.1625,0.0397,3.0047,3.1228,0.6772,3.1056,8.7606,0.6065,1.6581,0.0499,4.3264,0.6108,1.2901,0.171,2.3595,4.1789,0.9713,6.393,3.1207,5.3102,1.701,0.0113,2.1651,1.9128,3.8324,8.7054,6.893,3.5999,2.4078,1.8527,3.4163,1.1836,5.8244,0.0185,4.4466,1.7355,0.0041,6.8034,1.4975,6.7673,1.0214,0.5297,6.9254,0.2598,1.7494,1.9837,5.1725,1.2589,7.2835,4.5925,2.4041,7.022,4.8739,5.3102,2.8809,1.9063,12.7219,0.0053,0.0014,5.2967,3.9316,4.2341,0.222,4.2736,2.0727,0.0006,9.69,3.2097,2.776,0.8527,5.0413,4.7952,1.4454,1.1143,4.7732,5.3172,4.3413,7.716,2.4463,0.3757,1.941,4.8176,4.5057,0.2834,3.3221,7.4376,0.0414,1.2628,2.0162,0.0294,3.9086,0.0481,3.0429,1.8577,1.8965,4.7323,10.5739,5.8491,4.9716,0.0003,2.016,2.2512,4.2182,0.1013,2.204,4.0191,0.431,3.1244,0.0008,0.0158,7.3121,5.7256,0.9234,6.6697,3.8799,4.7919,1.5861,4.8409,1.1174,1.6382,1.9233,4.9715,1.7235,4.415,1.3824,2.3419,0.7657,0.8768,3.0971,0.3602,7.8875,1.3212,0.4653,2.191,4.8756,5.8413,0.2356,4.8559,2.6616,8.1133,1.4095,6.459,0.9735,3.7014,3.5039,2.8059,3.4459,2.5473,4.0298,3.7892,9.0766,0.1525,3.5237,2.3633,1.5277,3.4899,2.0863,0.8666,2.4995,0.0025,1.8316,5.4528,3.6996,0.0222,1.8336,5.1313,4.8587,5.5737,2.2231,1.5268,1.3349,2.6003,5.1734,3.6517,3.1387,1.0354,4.7929,4.6098,1.587,0.3668,3.9634,6.4409,0.8845,3.1352,3.5599,0.3326,6.5006,2.6474,3.1046,0.4726,5.7828,4.7922,1.0908,0.0924,0.0894,0.3026,4.4205,0.5465,0.4132,6.6608,5.1115,0.7667,0.4033,4.4419,2.0184,4.0228,0.2684,0.7093,3.9563,1.5471,7.4434,3.1025,0.1374,0.4338,4.197,2.4148,4.9452,0.0659,2.0165,3.1011,6.6017,0.8448,5.4909,2.7841,0.2602,0.7187,3.8475,3.2995,5.0488,1.8592,0.2301,3.6259,0.019,0.2288,1.6477,3.8543,1.9627,0.0954,3.4597,2.1192,8.4527,2.5963,2.8537,4.5955,1.9712,0.0099,0.0024,0.0075,4.756,0.5999,7.6166,0.1015,3.5396,2.97,4.8771,9.343,0.8839,3.1534,6.4198,2.4324,0.0814,7.7386,4.3646,0.0027,3.1757,3.7959,4.4256,8.3836,0.1039,0.0416,0.4152,5.1956,0.7968,0.0032,1.1629,1.4702,0.027,2.4292,0.0029,1.5683,6.6924,6.3442,4.7286,1.0297,5.8226,1.0633,0.6839,2.4898,1.8366,5.6591,0.5307,0.8219,1.6455,3.7876,1.7221,6.427,3.2291,0.4919,1.323,7.1186,0.2455,4.249,0.766,6.5189,0.016,0.694,8.3013,1.0827,2.2737,6.3244,0.1279,3.0919,0.0018,6.2671,0.5136,1.8355,2.6048,0.6281,4.603,5.8436,2.256,0.2096,1.2278,7.1379,1.6841,4.4344,2.896,1.6793,0.1344,3.3383,1.7443,2.4878,5.0816,2.5714,1.9303,4.7652,4.7691,2.3629,0.0091,4.3156,6.3976,1.6601,3.8772,4.8947,4.1312,0.2977,7.0249,5.3172,3.2583,4.5216,2.8552,2.9495,3.6886,4.2531,2.4836]}

The @ - @ set design for Thunderbirds consisted mainly of a single large table set into a wall of white-light walls, and four small rooms, including a library, a laboratory, a living room and a private quarters. This set had to deal with the special effects needed to create the moving and flying objects in the set, as well as allowing for the actors to be at different heights, as required by the role of each individual character. The set incorporated numerous lighting & special effects elements to simulate many of the more technical and complex visual effects in the show. It also allowed the action in the show to unfold at full scale on an open-air stage with a natural flow through the various spaces. A series of cameras, some mounted to the roof & ceiling and others lowered, took photographs as a basis for the special effects needed to simulate the use of flight in the set as well as the action. All of the set\u2019s lights were equipped with color filters fitted at specific intervals throughout their light paths. In addition, other lights were used to help set the correct moods for particular scenes.The use of motion-control & Cineflex film camera gear was also introduced during the filming of the @ - @ show. The use of these new cameras allowed filming to be undertaken with a view to using a wider variety of angles than could otherwise be achieved without being tied down to a specific camera angle.","token_len":379,"entropy":[11.9841,9.3373,5.3641,2.2845,1.3501,5.653,0.8832,9.6565,1.8337,1.6383,6.1747,3.7894,13.9582,10.0694,4.024,11.4751,6.289,2.1,0.4723,4.1144,0.9254,0.6191,4.1815,5.5996,5.0222,6.6445,1.6943,0.8722,7.7837,6.2523,3.1073,8.2666,8.4375,3.987,3.6646,3.4347,0.8601,5.9347,5.9729,1.9773,1.4848,0.8066,1.0674,0.1924,2.3598,1.9652,1.6004,6.0188,6.0814,1.7175,3.6929,2.3271,2.231,5.8657,13.6483,7.2815,5.129,7.2325,2.0916,0.3878,2.6849,1.981,4.6232,5.6057,4.7546,6.9413,2.799,6.6385,2.1068,4.0244,4.2231,2.8729,2.2786,5.094,2.7378,1.3486,0.2282,7.6969,5.2923,9.2229,11.9429,3.7673,4.7907,3.0947,3.7993,3.5875,1.5534,0.1117,5.2078,5.0026,7.211,8.0099,1.2595,1.7884,4.7616,0.2574,0.0219,3.7197,6.3213,3.3487,2.2482,0.0667,4.9409,5.4366,0.0126,2.1242,3.9719,4.5031,5.5697,3.535,7.1368,1.1904,5.0422,2.8057,4.3775,4.6723,5.6968,6.4481,1.7171,2.9034,4.6886,2.5075,5.0556,2.7626,3.4606,1.0267,7.2245,1.1915,1.6975,6.3148,0.4567,0.9032,4.1622,0.1587,1.2391,0.5537,4.4447,5.4537,0.4602,4.1496,1.2785,3.4694,3.4133,8.3037,0.1039,1.6768,5.961,1.1266,3.3884,0.7286,2.0769,1.0857,6.9257,3.3159,4.9758,4.4225,2.858,0.5731,3.9284,1.4505,2.1496,0.293,0.0029,6.8532,1.1869,1.3279,4.2074,0.3512,2.9689,5.665,3.3911,2.6275,2.4458,3.1812,3.829,1.6999,0.5683,5.7083,1.96,4.406,2.8896,1.4073,0.4446,1.6037,1.5035,8.8009,4.5432,5.0237,7.0824,5.3678,0.0205,2.3593,2.6015,5.2764,5.7048,0.9743,0.1243,4.3833,5.7927,2.6384,2.9892,5.5716,0.0922,2.9774,0.9156,3.352,0.7247,4.2655,1.4251,4.4268,1.5833,6.424,4.2393,0.4792,1.8752,0.1115,5.1446,3.245,4.9099,3.853,4.8632,3.7347,4.2025,2.667,2.4359,1.0117,2.6859,2.0099,5.9479,5.3304,5.2163,0.5084,5.0766,5.1295,1.4673,4.2914,4.7081,0.0158,6.0349,2.9003,5.8089,3.2365,2.2932,0.6261,4.1475,6.1094,4.7958,4.0915,1.2601,7.2622,4.1905,4.2692,3.1703,4.2376,3.5832,6.9606,0.3213,0.7314,5.3369,0.0653,6.6121,0.4369,5.0032,0.7575,6.1934,0.0283,7.737,2.3434,0.5779,2.9916,5.3484,0.7225,0.0312,1.0029,4.7813,1.8284,4.9578,1.0319,0.355,2.7386,11.4055,0.6057,0.0088,7.4054,1.1672,5.603,0.0883,6.7937,3.0937,7.7338,5.7816,5.9097,4.356,2.8926,5.4445,6.5057,5.8441,1.2224,3.5335,1.0299,0.5978,6.8034,2.8526,0.7107,2.5142,0.6721,4.4669,5.1711,0.5589,6.7717,4.7679,3.8747,1.5131,7.8824,0.4376,0.9856,3.1881,5.2867,0.015,3.7738,2.9045,2.9471,7.1526,7.9756,3.3281,5.5506,5.0749,4.761,5.1488,1.478,1.7438,4.9699,2.668,0.66,0.9189,0.3222,1.6195,6.4044,0.2069,0.0609,3.2342,0.9314,1.485,3.0762,0.0045,3.1851,5.0399,1.387,2.0024,4.1815,2.5537,0.7594,5.6339,2.1597,1.8405,4.7145,0.9035,3.7267,2.9851,4.1574,1.9641,0.0036,4.167,3.1466,4.6772,1.9693,0.1245,2.1346,4.598,5.1042,6.1117,0.4987,0.5366,1.5478,2.7333,1.9404,3.9923,0.3396]}

{"id":3691,"ended":false,"length":346,"text":"There is dispute in medievalist circles over the size of the war horse, with some notable historians claiming a size of 17 to 18 hands ( 68 to 72 inches, 173 to 183 cm) [ 1 ] and others stating it was more likely a much smaller beast, being smaller than a large English archer, meaning a height of around 60-65 inches ( 155-170 cm) tall. But now a new study has found evidence for the existence of the world's largest horse.\n\nIn a paper published in the April 2015 issue of the journal ZooKeys, John-Paul Hodnett and colleagues of Bristol University have uncovered one of the largest and best preserved horse fossils ever found. The animal is from the late Pleistocene epoch, around 800,000 years ago in Siberia. They have identified not only a skeleton belonging to one adult horse, but three baby horses that were less than nine months old. The largest horse was 19.1 hands (80.4 cm), 2.2 hands (5.6 cm) taller than its largest descendant today.\n\nThe new find shows that horse size was not only limited in size by size of the rider. A horse of this size would have to be extremely agile and powerful for its size, being as tall as two men ( 5\u2019 7 \u201c, 174 cm) and as long as five men (5\u20197\u201d, 174 cm).\n\n\"For thousands of years horse riders have tried to find the largest horses yet known,\" said Hodnett. \"We now think that size was only one factor. There may also have been other forces at work that allowed the horses we have found to be so large. We now think that early horses could be as big as these and perhaps even larger. Our fossil horse suggests horse size had also changed in the Ice Age.\"\n\nMore to come","token_len":379,"entropy":[2.8744,11.1144,2.9573,9.2268,8.1165,2.2051,1.8517,1.6041,6.5991,0.1569,0.5707,6.9416,7.9828,1.4552,3.4404,1.3362,8.8647,3.6669,2.0596,4.0077,5.2816,0.4919,5.3575,2.8239,1.497,7.2018,3.297,14.4147,2.4863,3.2558,3.1119,2.5817,7.7478,0.4071,4.5546,0.6317,2.7648,4.5516,3.9784,1.8503,1.8552,1.0182,4.1917,2.8907,0.5528,4.2266,4.4851,2.4377,5.7605,1.3183,4.0001,2.1635,5.8795,3.0027,1.1684,1.4477,4.557,9.7281,5.9774,0.0404,1.8901,7.0041,3.0773,9.4654,0.4987,2.9161,4.7529,2.7067,1.3462,1.3712,1.9771,6.562,0.9488,2.0551,0.176,1.1414,6.5319,0.929,5.39,6.4158,2.8379,1.5323,1.0121,1.7584,2.0321,4.5248,1.9221,1.603,3.9287,0.0146,1.8489,5.3394,0.0898,0.6418,1.747,1.7505,0.9892,0.001,2.7663,1.4431,2.431,0.5487,0.4792,0.4958,5.6726,3.8452,0.1651,0.0083,0.6423,0.8914,5.3653,0.1527,0.2038,6.3495,6.8902,2.4713,8.2491,5.2792,0.4655,1.6381,1.3318,3.3775,6.1572,0.0716,2.4235,4.2377,5.5482,0.2479,0.1209,1.5097,2.8787,4.0308,0.9613,2.5453,3.0673,1.2656,0.6085,1.6304,1.5067,4.1929,2.3256,4.3402,0.8918,3.8819,2.7622,0.0004,0.0,2.273,0.8825,2.9583,4.8195,2.1358,0.0154,0.1163,0.1544,4.0915,5.7802,0.9209,3.6089,2.5389,2.6137,7.0283,0.2116,1.4841,3.5454,6.0468,0.0024,3.4764,8.2225,1.5488,0.91,0.0731,5.5108,7.0869,1.0059,2.4114,1.0871,6.6795,0.097,5.6042,1.3298,0.1024,1.358,1.5593,5.3427,2.0537,2.3526,7.589,1.4882,3.199,7.9679,0.4601,5.8164,1.3516,2.3298,1.8554,2.0576,6.4015,0.2596,2.8044,3.7891,0.0454,5.4812,0.1682,2.3237,0.2498,0.5901,6.391,0.4475,3.3421,5.4556,7.1671,7.8011,0.8144,0.7258,0.0002,1.1317,3.715,3.6498,3.7263,0.4851,4.8417,3.3619,1.1705,2.4387,3.0566,3.8155,4.018,3.7686,2.4989,4.9555,1.4652,0.8885,4.8872,3.7973,3.9002,2.4418,3.0001,1.6773,0.2596,2.1491,0.5869,4.0993,1.5427,4.1927,3.8818,1.4605,3.263,2.208,1.5257,1.8506,2.1082,5.5767,4.5593,2.7217,0.0436,4.3907,2.5232,3.3171,6.1281,12.1603,10.2202,3.7027,3.8032,4.7505,6.4452,7.604,1.0952,1.2776,1.1211,1.4674,2.4307,0.0271,2.9857,2.203,0.1645,2.005,0.6395,0.089,5.4909,1.7436,5.778,1.3016,3.9208,0.1326,0.5225,1.7524,0.0002,2.102,5.0487,5.8408,0.0281,0.0165,3.4512,3.4788,1.7334,6.2963,0.1196,4.0685,1.9522,1.8798,2.3155,4.7699,6.4756,1.5389,1.1682,0.7558,0.001,0.0015,0.4143,0.227,2.5807,2.8001,4.742,1.1375,6.7619,1.7324,3.7785,2.644,0.8945,2.2554,4.2438,3.615,3.0195,0.9125,0.0332,1.1146,5.1203,1.6417,0.3934,2.7855,3.8795,1.4157,2.1517,9.2454,2.4265,1.3154,0.3377,2.1705,2.1242,1.0498,1.3927,2.1639,2.9497,2.253,0.7378,6.7066,2.3811,2.5548,2.4602,3.6957,1.9063,0.0974,5.1313,5.5359,4.0943,0.9606,1.1308,2.0876,3.4124,5.82,4.754,4.4701,6.4253,1.2742,4.2686,5.4433,2.6168,2.3414,1.0667,7.8249,0.0552,1.6858,0.1009,0.0002,6.2721,5.1189,0.7069]}

{"id":3492,"ended":true,"length":335,"text":"Yeats was an Irish Nationalist at heart, looking for the kind of traditional lifestyle displayed through poems such as'The Fisherman '. However, as his life progressed, he sheltered much more within the realms of literary imagination, as reflected through his work'The Lake Isle of Innisfree '.\n\nBelfast is where Yeats spent his time while in the east end of Ireland, surrounded by poets such as John Millington Synge, W. B. Yeats, WB Yeats, and many other great poets, in the years after he left his native country, living on the grounds of University College.\n\nYeats became increasingly concerned with the plight of the unemployed, spending time lecturing on the topic himself. This was reflected in his poem'The Burial of the Dead '.\n\nAt Trinity College, he met fellow poet C. V. Lewis, with whom he established the Yeats Club in 1911, allowing his fellow poets and fellow writers the opportunity to discuss and debate their favourite areas of literature.\n\nIn 1913, Yeats married Alice Gibbons, his third wife. He also had a son from his previous marriage, and then his final child, a daughter, became his wife. Both he and the child were called Michael.\n\nOn his wedding day, Yeats wore a red sash as part of the custom of the day, symbolising the blood that was shed for liberty, at the same time that many members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood were meeting to discuss how best to implement their plan for Irish independence. Later, he would describe this as the day his spirit broke. On that day, both his children were baptised by the name Michael.\n\nYeats was arrested by the British authorities in Dublin, and in 1915, he left Ireland with his family for France, leaving behind his many friends and admirers.","token_len":379,"entropy":[8.365,3.8684,4.1042,5.4264,6.1649,4.3166,5.9459,4.2723,1.0646,7.914,1.4336,2.5377,5.3619,0.0163,7.4272,8.0382,10.3928,5.6364,10.0041,3.8275,0.0012,9.9285,2.565,8.7237,0.8795,9.9649,5.047,0.1257,3.2386,3.0258,3.2253,1.6961,0.6085,0.9381,13.1734,6.7437,2.8093,5.4469,0.716,7.1728,0.0142,4.4331,5.5163,1.5564,3.239,5.9638,4.4284,0.8286,2.4876,7.1989,1.9886,8.7491,10.4992,2.7591,5.5043,1.4027,0.9406,2.1792,2.0161,0.5023,4.9098,3.8883,0.0069,4.8002,3.8791,4.8447,0.0003,4.1083,1.0967,3.4936,4.4852,2.6759,1.9374,7.1326,4.1917,0.1134,1.6864,1.1009,6.2812,0.046,7.2649,1.7761,0.0025,2.8457,5.6094,4.2024,0.1971,15.0971,3.9619,1.4129,6.1232,0.5609,4.4194,0.3718,0.5003,0.0026,0.8679,12.125,1.1284,0.0012,0.6266,1.5245,3.6037,3.2323,2.7895,2.2006,2.0675,4.3742,1.3859,3.7552,2.4907,2.6377,1.3568,2.8878,1.1504,2.5684,2.6589,5.9376,2.9495,0.9602,5.9371,0.0846,8.5534,0.502,3.6486,1.2057,0.0001,2.1275,0.002,4.6401,4.3151,3.3147,0.7607,1.0514,4.0185,0.0372,1.3278,6.5013,1.2108,8.1465,2.7749,7.6633,0.0054,1.809,1.1966,5.2531,6.4651,1.0712,3.6658,2.0247,4.2758,0.2644,0.5388,3.8196,3.8774,1.4029,7.9244,1.6544,0.5876,1.121,4.2348,3.7975,1.2732,0.0001,4.2048,7.844,0.1292,1.0239,2.4828,3.5748,3.6351,2.0698,5.2887,0.759,4.9357,0.4999,5.8904,0.8702,4.8674,0.0546,0.1465,5.3809,1.9707,6.0453,0.0078,4.2499,2.04,5.2801,1.6121,7.6906,3.9586,3.4749,2.0333,2.4119,3.7916,3.3428,2.7296,0.7754,0.0411,4.5763,2.5366,2.723,2.8301,5.1838,8.2365,0.2092,2.5135,0.6296,1.0861,0.0001,2.0155,2.2187,0.347,0.7996,0.0051,4.7468,5.8742,8.0812,0.4165,0.5684,4.2042,3.2567,0.2459,0.8474,2.8573,2.8295,1.3594,1.7457,0.9323,5.7893,1.8292,3.4759,0.1066,0.9062,3.0829,5.5253,3.5114,5.7395,0.9937,0.8388,3.5369,0.7275,1.3873,5.7528,1.4539,1.7453,0.6116,5.5438,3.329,0.0376,4.364,4.5266,1.7425,7.06,8.2545,2.0327,0.3636,0.0001,3.7346,2.4643,3.5789,0.221,0.581,2.4723,0.0039,5.7643,0.5843,2.8355,5.5474,0.3504,4.1865,3.6338,0.0027,2.0187,4.687,0.7433,1.3538,3.0987,1.0288,5.6628,0.426,1.2462,6.3935,3.1662,2.3046,0.5991,2.2974,9.8159,2.18,4.9545,0.9496,3.5888,0.0312,2.8332,4.8339,4.4181,0.0647,0.4938,2.4508,4.2281,5.6679,1.8296,7.3995,1.8389,2.8076,3.4889,3.5729,0.0149,5.8557,1.8619,3.7668,1.4884,2.5978,1.8929,0.1997,6.8832,0.859,1.8659,2.5471,6.7129,2.6294,1.8222,1.7604,2.513,4.3713,7.1366,4.6141,2.4225,5.6043,2.8255,0.5278,0.2912,5.8988,1.997,3.4271,1.3535,4.9846,0.001,2.9246,1.1668,4.5632,3.8576,1.5219,0.2543,0.0001,3.2687,0.0052,1.7235,6.037,2.1153,0.5183,2.9754,1.9279,1.2058,4.2077,2.3611,1.6644,3.7482,3.1546,1.3828,1.7278,4.2625,1.0461,2.7602,0.5287,2.1591,3.2771,3.4103,1.1872,4.9534,1.1137,1.3277,6.3477,2.4619,0.8535,4.7767,0.001,0.5499]}

Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell was published in January 2008, and has been very well received by critics, although some found that it was slow paced and overly descriptive. On release, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell had an overall 87% rating on the review aggregator site Metacritic.\n\nThe success of the film adaptation saw Clarke become a successful best-selling author and, at a personal level, helped to ease a period of severe depression. He has also worked on further adaptations of his non-Fable novel works in the form of both a sequel to The Silmarillion and of the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant.\n\nClarke has long been a writer for British television and radio series, winning an Emmy and a Golden Globe award for his work on the television series Blake's 7. He has also created several novels for the audio book medium.

{"id":3843,"ended":true,"length":364,"text":"The couplet of Sonnet 86 finally allows the reader a glimpse of the speaker's true vulnerability. It is here that he sets aside his attack on the Rival Poet in order to admit that the woman on his arm is the only female he has ever loved. His sense of loss and loneliness is profound, and while he is at pains to defend himself from the charge of having no love for \"the good wife,\" he is equally adamant that the woman he so longs not to see again has never been his true love. The speaker continues to resist this notion.\n\nThe poem has received a great and deserved deal of attention for its allusive reference to the 'Gentlemen', but it is possible (although perhaps unlikely) that the speaker had in mind another person. In any case, he attempts to refute this theory. 'Though you be his rival,' he asserts, 'I am not jealous': a line which strongly implies that his love was true. Even in his final lines he is unswerving in his defense of both 'good wife and gentle wife' -- in other words, he denies the very possibility that he ever loved any woman other than the one upon whom his final appeal rests.\n\nIn the sonnet preceding this line the speaker tells his lover that he has made his peace with the world -- he will do nothing to prevent the destruction of the man she loves, because he intends to leave it at once. On this point, however, nothing could be further from the truth: the speaker continues to deny his feelings for this woman -- for many of the other woman upon whom he has written similar lines. He does not regret the affair, because it 'fills the deep need [which] in my soul was bare'. It is precisely because this need is bare that this affair has left him 'without heart,' and made him so cold.","token_len":379,"entropy":[8.3098,11.1768,3.3267,10.9892,3.0052,8.9832,8.5745,7.7173,2.0363,4.9104,5.2716,2.1485,0.8614,1.1459,8.0652,1.3906,5.0963,9.4372,1.0415,2.9475,2.0328,5.2009,0.3932,3.7547,7.4521,5.531,0.9213,9.1569,1.9858,0.88,6.6855,7.6266,8.7316,3.8085,3.6063,0.9502,0.023,7.0496,0.6722,1.8797,6.9194,4.6575,2.5248,6.0481,1.0262,3.0176,3.8295,5.4756,2.3715,1.0403,0.6407,5.6815,0.4405,4.3437,7.1167,0.0676,5.2745,2.4649,4.2305,1.3084,6.0709,1.3858,1.0745,4.7739,1.5394,2.2216,4.3104,2.0507,0.049,4.5859,2.0911,2.2219,1.1314,6.19,0.941,4.7162,5.5334,2.9299,1.5087,6.5235,1.3399,4.3816,4.8464,1.0578,0.6442,1.5941,4.1993,5.0026,0.3168,2.0335,1.9492,1.7581,6.6787,4.6912,2.2969,5.9883,0.848,2.4076,5.2334,3.4927,3.844,1.2291,1.4778,3.7252,0.585,0.2601,2.8278,5.7349,4.8044,0.9858,5.9567,2.6538,4.9482,3.4851,1.564,0.0118,1.9763,5.6291,4.1352,5.3555,1.9538,2.807,7.9379,4.2928,5.963,0.006,1.4977,3.7742,0.3567,7.4959,4.6686,7.4325,0.035,1.124,5.9949,6.2723,3.7099,1.1116,4.5456,3.011,1.7139,0.9168,6.7702,6.1824,4.1418,3.3464,1.9203,0.1227,0.2204,1.3754,3.6889,3.6417,4.5492,0.3649,5.1838,4.8751,2.2651,2.8702,3.0072,0.3221,0.059,2.5869,6.2411,0.1501,5.8945,1.4174,3.9047,2.9167,5.6928,7.4008,4.0698,5.6229,6.8778,7.9637,1.6275,0.2119,5.1208,0.2737,0.1416,2.0469,1.9397,1.4369,5.2014,7.4922,3.8474,3.8063,2.1877,7.7245,2.0546,0.4181,3.0689,3.0687,3.7898,7.2806,1.1649,5.5075,2.8515,2.0441,5.192,5.1125,2.304,2.3837,5.6026,5.4029,0.3965,0.4657,0.4209,3.6593,0.3851,5.3344,4.9597,3.9081,2.371,4.1279,3.7811,3.5904,0.9953,6.0733,3.8203,2.4331,0.0108,0.1746,1.2384,5.1,1.6963,4.628,2.192,0.4598,1.3913,2.792,1.7785,3.0589,1.9793,2.1025,0.0134,1.7799,1.1185,7.1683,0.2711,2.5319,7.269,4.9319,3.3636,0.1375,1.0682,0.0002,2.9453,1.771,9.2419,0.048,10.565,1.7251,3.2752,2.8042,2.0205,5.3814,1.6351,3.9144,0.9607,1.0135,1.8942,4.3662,2.8669,3.7345,0.4694,1.681,4.5738,4.2525,3.2219,3.4866,4.5603,3.0776,1.236,3.2951,1.8752,4.0792,0.0952,1.5794,4.7712,4.4665,0.9316,1.9779,4.24,1.174,6.0451,0.2652,4.2864,4.1189,2.9713,2.8779,0.428,5.1858,2.0917,1.8908,1.9045,3.0083,0.0068,6.4708,4.0876,0.3718,0.7606,0.015,0.0395,0.0295,3.2722,1.5523,2.6999,4.4809,0.2546,2.0389,2.4348,4.9334,1.0009,3.8226,0.5783,3.7924,3.69,6.7004,3.0397,1.5419,3.4528,5.4219,5.8366,0.1153,0.6231,1.9788,5.2814,8.658,1.6528,1.6221,2.4517,3.1394,0.4009,7.5472,1.7249,6.7073,1.2919,3.8868,2.0362,7.1289,4.8603,3.8998,2.5485,6.5644,5.2342,6.1156,4.8984,1.0301,5.6586,2.9959,3.6619,3.4942,9.8915,2.8958,3.5265,0.5205,5.0094,1.4851,2.7804,5.6189,1.0619,4.5645,0.3183,3.881,6.9925,2.5761,5.5998,0.5796,5.073,4.1586,7.031,4.4081,1.8995,6.7414,0.1755,4.2292,5.264,3.6187]}
{"id":24,"ended":true,"length":361,"text":"Most Egyptian deities represent natural or social phenomena. The gods were generally said to be immanent in these phenomena \u2014 to be present within nature. The types of phenomena they represented include physical, magical, and social phenomena. The gods were thus thought to be involved in \"nature, the cosmos, the community, history, the present time, events in time, the human world, and existence.\"\n\nMythological beings represented in ancient Egypt were called ba (praetermissus est), from which comes our word \"be\". These \"beings\", \"nature\", and \"cosmos\" could and could not be seen, and were often perceived as present only as forces. Their existence and the way they had influence on individuals were believed to be the result of their influence on the forces of nature. These beings are usually described as powerful; in other words, they were divine beings who were able to create a \"sphere of influence\" that was far-reaching and could affect the whole human community.\n\nEgyptian religion is a religion of life, and its gods were said to be associated with life, birth, and existence in all its forms. However, Egyptian religion is also a religion of destiny, for life is not entirely under control, fate being as omnipotent as the gods. The gods were believed to be present in history and as part of the human world. Their influence was felt as far back as history could be traced. Egyptians believed that the gods could intercede in human affairs and solve human problems. Thus, gods were gods of miracles and of the power to cause changes in the natural world.\n\nThe gods could also be characterized as a divine order of nature or the divine law of nature. They could also be seen as \"gods of the people\" who represented common people, either as personified beings or as symbols representing the common people.","token_len":379,"entropy":[11.3333,8.2819,6.6623,8.4352,3.8148,4.8177,3.1648,1.5681,1.858,4.4832,3.7613,4.867,5.9354,0.0123,1.0932,8.3707,1.3376,1.8269,6.4636,3.4473,5.8439,5.005,1.4825,3.1387,4.7613,5.9061,2.3722,1.9202,8.6736,0.1196,5.0604,3.1694,1.1225,2.2442,4.7358,1.3352,4.5436,0.2482,1.6127,2.7053,1.1822,0.4409,1.9063,3.5596,1.3717,6.2049,4.0127,0.1891,0.8034,5.2677,0.199,5.6236,3.9241,4.0261,3.472,4.5815,0.2223,1.7295,7.2958,0.6847,6.1125,0.2073,2.4065,6.7655,5.1563,0.5951,5.8306,3.2782,2.5731,0.5955,2.1822,5.3114,3.6635,0.363,1.2701,7.4234,1.6946,1.6128,0.0013,5.5813,1.5517,4.6953,4.2639,2.8369,4.3246,0.6458,1.0242,3.5196,9.2536,4.4381,4.7428,4.2088,6.2375,12.5356,2.0461,10.2776,1.3194,5.3804,3.7538,4.8136,4.7264,2.713,1.6912,2.6166,4.0881,3.5974,4.5518,0.8936,1.598,3.0053,5.9621,6.5087,0.9702,1.0733,0.549,6.0354,2.6081,0.3653,5.4476,6.6078,3.6595,0.036,0.5439,4.4035,2.421,2.1869,1.8092,3.7931,5.5125,0.6354,6.7065,2.9682,3.07,8.2602,2.7412,4.036,3.0822,3.3085,3.1186,4.0087,0.3917,4.2916,9.6852,1.297,7.1531,2.0855,5.2505,0.1412,0.4782,2.792,2.1852,0.007,1.593,3.1516,0.9074,1.2243,5.594,1.2664,0.1647,0.5493,3.7797,2.6277,3.0625,4.041,2.2881,0.2488,7.5673,5.9033,3.8716,2.5478,0.0598,0.2187,0.5725,1.2226,5.8821,1.9502,1.7689,1.7865,2.7418,0.028,3.1145,3.1171,3.7846,5.7273,0.4718,0.6719,2.9087,0.4202,2.3818,1.9632,5.2684,4.9829,0.2162,0.9879,3.5724,2.4955,1.9205,2.8527,3.1664,3.4053,0.3597,0.8761,0.0002,3.6462,0.8479,4.3612,2.6422,2.7016,4.3652,0.6743,5.3363,1.247,2.0407,3.3717,2.9421,1.5891,3.3936,0.0039,0.634,4.3251,0.0363,1.8986,1.3961,6.5365,0.0561,1.4358,7.3366,3.8791,2.6401,2.918,0.998,0.3755,4.5105,0.0221,4.0938,1.86,2.0347,2.489,1.7413,1.2318,0.1042,6.909,0.8102,4.0726,5.0381,1.2289,2.8208,7.5681,7.4867,1.7407,1.9928,8.994,4.4324,5.3518,5.2892,0.7046,0.1737,1.8964,2.4158,1.0147,1.8805,1.0634,1.4768,3.2944,0.0339,0.6605,3.9698,1.0539,5.7081,1.3357,5.3749,4.1368,0.0255,0.6701,2.9477,2.3472,1.2003,3.6494,1.947,1.7233,2.1931,3.4667,4.2732,0.3076,0.0803,5.0686,6.3267,3.3551,1.3514,0.9517,5.7681,0.9755,0.4221,1.3998,1.0897,3.1571,7.7727,1.9418,0.0007,2.316,3.0229,0.2228,1.7364,5.82,2.4349,0.1989,0.8142,4.1833,0.394,4.2042,1.0868,6.4299,1.4039,7.8092,1.1633,2.1084,3.001,4.2207,2.7793,3.6817,4.251,0.3984,0.7412,3.8193,0.2805,0.3449,1.0706,0.0002,1.7092,2.5235,4.3855,1.6202,0.9826,6.2459,0.3612,3.9867,4.889,4.3487,2.865,2.9062,2.7721,3.2747,2.8514,3.2298,2.0596,0.5657,0.4669,1.871,2.4955,2.5326,0.3045,3.568,0.1769,3.7224,5.1851,0.0303,0.8852,1.8116,5.8175,1.1401,2.1294,4.8292,6.9529,1.714,1.5784,6.6332,1.2881,7.8522,1.068,3.7213,0.5994,0.6183,5.7963,4.4892,1.2936,2.6604,0.3916,0.5029]}
{"id":402,"ended":false,"length":348,"text":"By early spring of 1794, the situation in France was dire. With famine looming after the failure of the harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was desperately attempting to keep the population fed. On March 11, a decree was issued to all citizens, regardless of creed, to prepare for a two day fast. It was to last from Monday, March 11, to Thursday, March 14, and those of the Catholic faith were told to not eat on Wednesday, March 13, and those of the Protestant, non-Protestant persuasion were told to refrain from eating on Thursday, March 14.\n\nAfter the decree, all of France descended into chaos. Without the support of Catholic French leaders, the French soldiers had turned on their own. In Paris, as on the home front, people began making their escape in large numbers. The country was in virtual anarchy with many cities being abandoned by soldiers. On March 18, the city of Orleans was abandoned by 2,000 soldiers and in the following days, many French cities would follow suit.\n\nThe situation also threatened the very life of the monarchy with the King being left only a few days of rations for him and his family. The decree would prove to be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back where many believed Louis XVI had already been executed in 1793. On March 22, an order was issued to every soldier to gather their families and head for Paris. Under cover of darkness on March 23, members of the Paris \u201cRed Guards \u201d, numbering between 15,000-65,000 stormed the Faubourg St Antoine and the Tuileries Palace. On the next day, revolutionaries marched to Versailles, and the King was taken into hiding by the British ambassador.

{"id":1872,"ended":true,"length":363,"text":"The second six companies landed while it was still dark, the destroyers coming to within five hundred yards ( 460 m ) to disembark the troops, under fire. They also landed at 05:50 on the morning of the 25th, after a long struggle. The first company, landing at the head of the main channel, found an extensive mine-field up the beach and only fifty yards ( 450 m ) of open water. It was then discovered that the beach had been washed out during the night, and that the beach was cut in two, with a very deep cliff and a sheer drop to the sea. The next company, landing at the southern end of the beach, also found itself in an extreme mine-field but the minefields had been cleared and it was a relatively easy operation to beach all the boats. The last three companies landed at the northern end of the beach and the last boat was a hundred yards ( 900 m ) short of the beach. The surf rose considerably, the wind had risen and in addition small waves swept over the beach and threw stones inland. The troops also encountered considerable difficulty in finding suitable landing places, and these were only reached when the companies had begun to run back and to form in the rear. It was impossible to land in any compact bodies, owing to the difficulty of landing the companies far enough apart to enable them to make good their footing on their way down the cliffs ; it would take a week at furthest to bring in the regiments and detachments which had to be landed. In order to improve the disembarkation positions of the other troops, the troops which had landed had to make good that part of the beach between a mile ( 1800 m ) from the head of the main channel and the shore of the peninsula east of the peninsula.\n\nThe landing party of the 22nd was also badly hampered by lack of adequate transport.","token_len":379,"entropy":[6.7499,9.0962,8.3682,9.5165,8.2705,4.3151,0.2143,1.0062,6.5489,1.6357,2.8821,13.0564,0.0345,8.0993,2.9642,8.3974,3.1756,3.8696,2.3904,4.7504,13.4912,3.2741,1.0196,4.6568,11.1717,2.1199,6.1998,2.7128,7.1634,3.36,2.1686,3.8262,4.704,2.6927,2.2899,9.5371,1.2001,3.499,3.4741,1.1337,2.6361,0.0639,1.113,3.7744,0.0392,1.445,3.3081,2.691,2.639,5.7558,1.5888,1.5386,3.1465,3.7442,2.5636,6.9247,0.5704,3.0444,5.4296,0.032,0.4558,4.2343,7.7284,0.6564,5.5957,4.5804,6.3129,5.2792,3.7028,0.7146,6.8915,1.7016,5.7536,2.7785,6.92,5.1608,0.3432,0.935,6.4015,0.0376,0.0431,1.4363,6.2245,1.7435,0.9182,2.9148,0.8468,3.5759,3.1735,0.252,0.8382,5.7139,1.3361,0.4914,6.3483,1.7512,4.7363,0.3428,2.9654,1.6452,0.9106,1.1477,0.8895,3.7977,1.2253,7.187,2.9247,1.0279,2.0054,2.5348,1.8857,4.864,3.8407,6.9831,3.3761,1.6204,7.0213,6.0509,3.1363,0.4821,1.6817,0.4629,1.1678,3.7795,1.1154,1.1446,0.7951,0.2833,0.367,5.3316,0.6224,0.1693,0.0501,2.0886,0.2065,5.4669,0.3426,6.371,2.0897,2.9188,4.8374,5.1553,0.9031,0.0672,5.7886,3.3547,1.593,4.0628,2.4461,1.0,2.4517,2.4732,3.8364,0.5373,5.542,5.9227,1.4324,3.7257,1.0294,9.7798,4.6816,0.7044,5.6881,1.567,1.2107,3.3888,2.8505,0.5599,1.2326,0.8878,0.613,3.524,0.1415,0.1141,0.03,0.4546,2.0909,2.8418,2.4181,6.3359,2.2038,4.9519,4.7635,0.0835,0.0479,5.5374,0.02,0.0802,4.3997,0.4353,0.3823,1.6815,0.6092,1.3446,8.633,9.1653,4.9332,1.7222,3.0844,3.7449,4.0437,5.0148,2.2272,5.711,5.448,7.3832,1.5932,5.2947,2.5335,0.2627,1.7742,2.2829,6.7948,5.477,7.3208,0.4733,1.1782,6.074,4.3389,3.3976,4.2286,3.2773,1.1547,3.1354,4.1981,3.1683,1.6553,1.8369,1.5274,5.4603,1.6313,4.3467,4.8217,2.6031,0.6877,6.5037,1.8318,5.2262,0.7774,5.9269,4.2933,2.5463,5.2864,7.0086,6.0262,1.3173,5.54,1.0951,3.9083,0.5226,4.3673,0.2861,4.3877,2.4187,3.9667,11.0014,11.056,1.983,5.0814,0.0653,0.3284,3.8074,0.5945,3.448,4.2486,5.2434,7.3969,2.6661,2.0517,1.5284,4.9094,0.7023,0.0477,3.14,3.5896,1.8311,6.2823,3.055,3.8668,1.8266,3.6789,1.389,5.3876,8.9891,3.6262,3.0138,2.5143,1.7715,5.5529,4.9542,11.6315,0.0163,0.727,4.9226,4.2463,1.7255,6.7633,0.3074,2.4644,4.9587,0.541,3.1046,1.5148,2.2553,1.0171,4.6598,1.5167,3.2028,2.7489,0.0869,5.3802,0.5683,8.7693,0.4034,7.232,1.69,0.2632,5.2639,3.8605,0.5617,0.8024,3.7405,5.4461,0.8632,1.9029,3.8142,0.1681,3.1917,4.0579,5.6376,4.9219,0.085,0.2706,0.7856,4.7888,5.5634,5.5694,0.3071,8.7288,0.0554,0.0468,6.0848,0.2421,4.3965,0.0675,0.0538,0.4262,0.2889,0.2716,2.5438,3.85,1.6469,0.2755,4.5305,8.1658,0.2417,0.8154,3.6066,0.6052,3.5877,0.0021,1.5327,4.6081,5.366,2.6953,0.6576,6.7872,0.7404,3.4445,4.3585,5.0271,2.6159,0.5994,4.8508,0.003,4.5539,5.3567,1.2632]}

McMaster was a natural choice for him because it was a Baptist university and many students who attended Woodstock were also students at McMaster.\n\nHe was very fond of the campus life and being able to engage with his community, and while he was studying, he taught Sunday School, played in the concert band, and was active in the drama club.\n\nInnis was hired by General Mills shortly after graduating from McMaster. During those years, he moved from St. Catharines to Toronto and to Owen Sound because the company kept changing locations and cities.\n\nIn October 1914, Innis was hired as the assistant editor of The Globe and Mail. General Mills had also hired a young journalist named William Lyon Mackenzie King to assist him. Mackenzie King was at that time considered a rising star, and with their mutual friend Jack Granatstein, they decided to rent an apartment in Toronto for the winter.\n\nThe three of them were able to save enough money, and with their shared income, they bought an apartment in Bloor Street where they rented out the lower level and had first-floor use.\n\nThis became the first house known as The Famous Castle, located at 1 Bloor Street West where Innis, Mackenzie King, and Granatstein lived. During his time in Toronto, Innis would often invite his friend James D. Ross to drop by their apartment.\n\nHe would often visit Innis \u2019 parents, who lived just five minutes from General Mills offices in downtown St. Catharines.\n\nInnis\u2019 parents, who raised him as a Presbyterian, were also impressed by Innis\u2019s involvement in music and theatre, and Innis went to school on their dime ( it was too expensive for Innis \u2019s parents ).","token_len":379,"entropy":[8.1794,9.4561,0.2524,13.0475,2.4599,5.5204,10.0438,1.0244,8.6858,0.3022,4.5041,11.3093,3.7968,2.598,2.2319,8.5445,1.5683,2.1519,7.3663,2.3872,0.8055,3.0712,2.0829,1.7145,0.7632,1.7911,10.528,1.5022,1.4074,5.3473,2.7049,4.3053,1.2945,11.1404,2.1944,2.0877,4.8413,4.3081,1.6159,2.4326,0.4664,1.6997,0.1859,3.0255,1.9731,3.9298,4.4424,0.0116,1.6622,4.648,6.3163,1.2394,7.1287,2.0818,0.0017,6.3623,1.1699,2.9671,3.1063,2.7241,2.4317,5.6136,1.0066,1.206,4.6825,2.7606,0.5121,6.2542,8.0626,0.8211,2.5762,7.0209,2.5806,1.0855,7.9186,2.6393,1.4044,0.8674,2.1699,4.2469,0.3456,1.0273,8.5074,0.8735,0.4304,1.2503,0.0002,2.2586,5.9388,1.4722,6.628,1.1523,6.4734,2.9272,6.242,0.3145,2.3923,0.716,1.6797,1.5714,4.5017,5.2692,0.6853,0.2598,0.6033,4.7563,2.9059,5.6226,0.2614,2.9165,0.0388,0.0001,0.6223,2.6654,1.5812,5.0932,8.5253,0.0222,6.762,2.7689,3.1614,6.7197,6.0106,4.7438,1.6605,7.7765,0.7163,1.0341,0.0002,1.4058,4.614,1.9636,0.1472,3.4481,0.0004,1.694,1.0154,1.8015,2.1683,4.3351,3.8994,0.4224,2.4383,3.9009,0.1912,0.0174,1.1577,7.2271,0.0066,2.7001,4.1304,1.8667,3.1979,3.9111,3.0285,0.9516,3.5413,6.2911,0.0497,0.8002,4.91,1.4919,6.0629,1.405,1.9766,3.9346,0.0003,0.534,0.959,5.6129,2.4388,0.0295,5.7668,1.2911,4.9049,0.2813,3.0901,1.265,5.381,5.9453,4.8115,3.6753,4.7125,8.3792,4.2026,8.9476,0.9589,3.0063,2.3252,0.1373,7.7571,2.9721,0.7286,0.8669,2.558,2.3543,1.9023,4.94,0.8622,0.6818,0.0002,2.8844,4.7624,1.159,0.0131,2.8143,3.0109,0.0041,5.6041,2.5747,0.2313,4.4301,1.273,3.9137,2.6533,6.1099,3.7893,0.5249,1.0363,3.2976,2.4161,0.4669,0.8164,6.5166,0.0411,2.1828,4.8351,0.5689,4.5433,2.1414,1.3426,7.0217,1.4045,3.7922,3.796,7.8741,1.5736,1.8791,6.5186,1.0352,0.9716,0.0002,4.8412,4.9844,1.7684,2.4124,4.7577,7.3828,1.7637,3.4346,8.5852,6.1609,1.6727,4.1064,1.7406,4.2853,4.1234,0.0018,0.8161,4.5156,4.5192,2.2544,0.0006,3.9452,1.8863,0.0009,0.582,0.3366,0.2473,2.8748,0.0034,0.0017,1.416,0.6686,5.8392,2.915,1.7427,1.801,0.9176,0.1632,1.0954,0.0008,3.1298,3.0037,5.0849,2.2861,2.7832,4.297,4.7515,2.2269,6.8138,0.8743,7.14,0.3511,3.8687,2.0692,1.4593,0.6599,0.0002,4.2537,1.5183,1.8849,3.385,4.1368,0.0006,13.8189,6.8168,12.021,2.065,3.4054,3.1389,4.839,5.5471,1.9848,0.7645,9.4511,0.0043,6.25,2.9221,3.8536,4.7368,0.0482,0.0124,0.0075,0.0013,0.7253,0.8796,0.0002,1.4322,0.2843,6.632,0.7306,5.65,2.1428,0.9442,8.8115,2.1184,2.8772,0.4314,5.7729,0.7573,2.1369,2.2654,6.4522,1.0249,3.8273,0.0008,2.1246,0.0524,3.0719,6.1334,0.3317,6.3136,1.2443,2.8975,1.9726,0.799,7.2613,0.0029,5.2642,0.845,3.5476,3.5833,5.3477,4.0113,5.1934,6.8827,0.5778,7.0526,1.4563,1.1841,4.717,0.0008,2.616,0.0591,1.6999,1.0487,3.555]}

{"id":1318,"ended":true,"length":353,"text":"On July 19, a tropical cyclone was detected. A ship reported a pressure of 1 @, @ 000 @. @ 7 millibars ( 29 @. @ 55 inHg ). The pressure gradually recovered to 30 @. @ 65 inHg ( 28 @. @ 80 inHg ) as it passed over a small island off of the southwestern coast of the Philippines. The ship then resumed an open-ocean voyage. @ 12. @ 20 p. m local time ( 21. @ 05 p. m, EDT, Atlantic Time ), the tropical cyclone was tracked to the extreme southwest and southeast of Sumatra Island. That afternoon, the eye of the cyclone passed through the area of low pressure observed by the ship. @ 3. @ 9 p. m local time ( 20. @ 00 p. m, EDT, Atlantic Time ), the tropical cyclone was again tracked to the southwest and southeast of Sumatra Island. @ 4. @ 5 p. m local time ( 20. @ 30 p. m, EDT, Atlantic Time ), the eye of the cyclone passed through the area of low pressure observed by the ship. @ 21. @ 00 p. m local time ( 03. @ 13 p. m, EDT, Atlantic Time ), the tropical cyclone made landfall in western Java. The ship continued along the southwest coast of Java Island until it ran aground near Tegal. About 11 p. m, the ship lost all power. @ 01. @ 11 a. m ( 7. @ 05 a. m, EDT, Atlantic Time ), the ship's crew evacuated the vessel. The ship was eventually lifted free from the shallow water and towed to the nearby port. The loss of power from the vessel was the result of flooding and heavy seas following the cyclone. Three people died on board the ship due to injuries from the storm.","token_len":380,"entropy":[7.612,3.4394,0.1878,3.8665,10.2195,4.0103,0.0039,3.2522,4.3712,5.3759,3.5983,7.0909,6.9239,2.1445,6.6907,1.2017,2.8482,12.409,6.5194,7.4169,9.0967,4.4893,3.2123,4.7329,5.9223,8.9419,0.9259,0.3184,2.6719,12.225,6.4825,3.4583,4.1248,6.7338,6.1967,9.5516,2.2867,2.7367,1.9268,3.461,7.6903,5.7986,1.7864,5.9994,1.0804,1.0187,0.4546,5.8375,0.9281,0.0792,0.0006,3.3793,4.3592,0.452,0.1489,0.2748,3.9391,0.275,0.1237,0.0005,1.6835,3.6622,2.296,3.5798,1.7208,3.8571,3.1506,1.0961,3.254,3.5431,1.3861,6.0249,0.642,0.2983,1.9648,2.4557,0.3778,1.3092,2.8155,3.1839,5.1073,6.0647,4.9266,1.8754,4.4482,0.0003,1.9073,1.7337,7.1902,4.7372,2.4063,2.5557,3.8791,5.8564,0.176,4.8941,9.1634,0.4591,1.7534,5.2693,1.5397,1.8052,6.1164,1.9649,0.0405,0.0852,6.0582,6.5114,2.769,8.3687,2.4074,3.3828,1.5781,5.0752,0.1223,0.0172,1.3498,6.5068,1.8453,1.4701,8.0157,2.5611,2.53,6.0107,0.951,6.554,0.0949,4.4544,1.1415,7.3713,5.9178,0.4795,1.0883,9.2527,0.6633,0.3894,4.2985,0.0184,3.036,2.3744,0.964,4.2523,1.281,5.6262,1.9039,6.0292,1.6337,0.7186,3.1532,1.029,2.3701,3.5156,0.6552,0.5296,4.0974,1.259,0.0065,0.0552,0.1359,0.0073,0.2973,4.042,0.0981,0.0974,3.5873,0.2806,0.0035,0.0104,0.1788,0.3924,0.1479,1.7013,0.0198,0.4461,0.2749,1.2759,0.0118,0.0116,0.6125,5.7874,0.6723,0.2996,0.1195,3.3358,0.6963,0.5668,0.0275,0.3888,0.0028,0.3356,0.2208,2.1356,2.188,0.0435,0.0739,3.2105,0.6042,0.0013,0.0059,0.0196,0.0004,0.0226,0.9629,0.0024,0.0154,4.3241,0.0323,0.0012,0.0158,0.0262,0.0615,0.0539,0.6503,0.0012,0.0681,0.1207,5.0975,0.1907,0.0071,0.2223,0.0075,0.8777,0.3621,0.134,0.1365,0.0026,0.1082,0.0018,0.043,0.0074,0.0036,0.0133,0.0994,1.012,7.7712,0.1096,0.1035,3.7579,0.1277,0.0014,0.0071,0.8397,0.0006,0.0461,8.3633,0.1469,0.0717,4.2205,0.4849,0.0015,0.0073,0.0427,0.4044,0.0572,1.0175,0.0017,0.116,0.0848,0.6542,0.0078,0.017,7.5016,0.447,1.4384,5.3691,4.6834,1.0646,1.5274,1.8883,2.4564,7.478,0.3513,5.1407,0.1521,0.1896,1.7915,5.1448,3.1211,1.0531,5.6447,1.3231,0.0001,3.0201,4.8795,9.7948,2.3131,5.6224,3.8367,1.4949,0.0017,0.1357,4.4675,0.5103,1.8292,5.7085,4.8416,2.9365,1.6629,1.498,5.9656,0.3362,0.2719,3.4113,2.4961,0.0007,0.2212,4.4169,4.1998,0.5424,0.4788,4.3105,0.2666,0.0024,0.0208,0.1546,0.595,0.1696,1.839,0.0047,0.1418,0.1585,3.2288,3.4991,4.1636,5.8451,1.1886,3.2012,1.5964,1.1931,1.1207,1.8291,4.5068,4.8021,6.8319,1.9947,0.3693,7.3971,0.8643,1.3873,2.9705,0.5506,1.2842,4.7176,3.2055,2.9111,1.613,6.7943,0.1037,0.4378,4.5864,0.2294,3.0398,1.5624,2.3895,1.3641,0.0034,5.5188,1.8758,3.9649,3.3321,6.2834,0.3534,2.9413,0.0074,0.3996,6.9694,3.1838,2.3516,2.4649,2.0838,0.8846,0.5199,4.7823,0.0022,4.1436,3.5147,0.4648,1.388,0.2782]}

Although he was thought of as one of the best players of the MLB at the time, the White Sox didn't want to pay such a big price to get a player that was going to be out of the AL in only a couple of years, and they let him go.\n\nWith the NL expanding to a 32 team league after the 1962 season, the White Sox, in need of a new owner, agreed to sell the team to Donald S. Blair, a Chicago real estate developer, and his two daughters, Sally and Joan, for a measly price of $6 million, which was about 1 million more than they would get if they just sold it to a buyer that didn't think of himself as a baseball team investor.\n\nBy the time the 1962 season rolled around, Blair had decided that he liked the idea of being part of a big league baseball team, but there were some things that he couldn't get adjusted to. His father was a fan of the Chicago Cubs, and Donald didn't like that he was going to have to face the Cubs almost every day. His second big problem was playing at home against AL teams. At first the White Sox played half their home games against AL teams, but that would drop down to half before the 1967 season. On the field, Blair was a very active owner and meddled quite a bit.\n\nBlair decided that he needed some players of his own to turn this team into a championship team, and so that's when he decided to pay the large amount of $8 million to get a new closer, closer to the goal. In, Blair made a surprising trade to get one of the best closers in the AL, Don Drysdale.","token_len":380,"entropy":[2.3183,8.288,6.8133,0.2915,4.0593,0.6652,3.225,0.2121,1.9759,8.7012,7.1104,1.6239,0.0633,6.1316,4.0212,1.6609,1.586,1.6909,1.3747,2.4378,3.2752,0.0025,0.1938,0.2834,0.06,4.2913,0.7437,0.6234,0.0004,8.4753,0.4244,6.1758,5.3871,2.0534,7.043,1.1131,0.1034,2.8392,0.0314,0.1326,1.944,1.8637,2.5088,1.4781,8.0621,5.9598,0.6487,0.0096,0.1077,2.6273,5.9449,0.009,3.3828,0.0008,2.866,0.4513,4.861,4.5626,0.5518,2.1915,0.9026,1.4748,2.5993,3.2946,2.3332,3.1415,1.8766,3.2488,0.0251,1.5466,6.229,1.1194,1.0167,4.913,2.8174,5.9732,2.0668,1.6085,0.495,0.3559,3.1847,1.2119,2.5342,6.6614,0.7334,0.6129,1.0942,1.0851,0.001,4.023,1.2652,6.13,8.217,1.0674,3.3028,6.1602,0.8167,0.7845,4.8807,1.1395,3.7622,0.0862,0.1449,1.1745,0.8248,0.0028,4.8796,2.9652,6.3395,0.0108,0.5985,2.4203,4.1154,0.3148,3.9442,0.0482,3.2768,1.4845,0.8513,0.699,8.68,4.2491,1.6044,9.1074,1.581,1.9621,4.5044,4.0815,0.0274,1.209,1.8665,1.7362,3.6791,4.9198,2.985,0.8066,5.8105,0.3802,6.0412,1.5145,1.42,1.9886,5.229,0.0004,6.2688,0.4395,0.2087,3.7601,0.5838,2.8371,2.1766,1.6874,3.7162,5.4074,3.3879,1.6762,0.0567,2.0754,2.3566,4.2545,2.7265,0.6194,4.2855,1.6369,1.8182,1.114,2.2544,4.6184,3.3275,3.1772,0.0007,5.0881,3.0037,5.5609,0.1084,0.6825,3.5588,5.0225,6.4742,0.2126,0.8831,0.0002,4.3193,1.039,0.6109,1.3548,4.984,0.1982,1.8517,0.0055,0.1289,2.3593,1.1955,4.447,1.003,1.3879,5.0238,1.0174,1.9268,0.1434,3.4982,3.5289,0.0016,0.9302,3.8226,2.4177,2.6029,0.2336,1.1985,2.6957,4.6977,1.4904,2.4473,2.445,0.9968,1.8439,3.3453,0.0003,2.8334,11.4882,0.8575,0.8115,4.0624,3.9454,1.579,1.1011,4.825,0.2445,0.8644,3.2183,0.5382,0.6193,0.6939,8.7895,4.9762,0.0007,1.3343,3.0861,1.5681,1.1238,1.9952,0.052,2.4746,0.1697,5.3497,1.1331,2.7423,7.0649,0.6258,1.171,0.8715,3.9549,4.9167,7.503,11.1849,0.4758,5.2848,3.1398,1.8522,3.3709,7.1971,1.9454,1.4147,5.1277,2.0257,3.9545,0.6784,0.0014,4.3012,7.6964,3.8623,3.9419,0.0844,1.4588,0.9518,0.2176,0.6187,0.7924,2.8728,4.2008,6.398,3.428,0.2731,1.9056,6.0696,1.2589,6.1885,0.0851,1.1841,5.4995,1.1709,4.0293,0.7684,2.921,1.9098,2.3227,3.2799,4.9838,5.6857,2.2425,11.1884,0.3626,5.183,0.0547,0.0864,1.4776,1.1115,0.0001,2.9665,0.0019,4.1912,1.1702,0.9365,3.4209,3.9799,4.9967,4.6161,0.5099,0.3069,1.1288,6.4517,5.0797,2.1034,1.6756,0.3472,4.0844,0.4739,1.1138,0.568,2.8121,5.0829,2.5261,1.195,0.8795,2.6141,0.2671,5.222,2.1967,8.3522,2.5443,0.2955,5.7568,3.5361,0.2001,1.3098,3.3576,2.4792,2.185,8.8868,1.3618,8.5624,1.6221,1.4745,5.1609,2.0905,3.5621,9.0111,3.6471,4.3025,1.7419,7.3236,4.0629,2.0198,2.4632,4.5271,0.2975,0.4704,1.702,1.9202,0.0063,0.2604,0.7505,2.706,0.9445,5.4403,5.1296,0.2164,0.0016,1.2305]}
{"id":1430,"ended":true,"length":356,"text":"In 1946, the Labour government in Britain, its exchequer exhausted by the recently concluded World War II, realised that it had neither the mandate at home, the international support, nor the capability to sustain the costs of its wartime commitments. In a bid to end the inter-temporal deadlock, it chose instead a two-year period in which it would raise funds from an international pool of loans, financed by the British Government.\n\nThis was the world we live in. And it is a system that we, as people in the 21st century, need to change, or else find ourselves on the receiving end of another financial meltdown like the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nFor now, if you had to summarise the UK Government\u2019s approach and thinking, you would have to say that they are pursuing an ideological position, in other words, that public policy should conform to the conservative model established during the 1970s.\n\nThat model has worked in many respects. It is true that we have seen growth in both wealth and productivity in the last 40 years. It is also true that the UK has managed to achieve a healthy balance between debt, or public sector borrowing, and government revenue and spending. But the financial and political crises the world is currently experiencing, like the 2008 financial crisis, prove that the model is inherently unstable and ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of an increasingly globalised and interdependent world.\n\nIt is not accidental that those countries that have been hit hardest by the financial crisis are those that have chosen to follow the conservative approach to financial management. Countries like Greece, Ireland, Ukraine and Portugal that have pursued a similar approach to the UK have found themselves in situations that simply pose financial and economic problems. The conservative UK Government, by following a similar approach to the one followed by Greece and other countries, made many of the same mistakes.","token_len":380,"entropy":[11.1335,0.2657,1.7939,7.6001,1.2195,3.978,1.844,3.5879,6.9607,8.6407,3.6612,0.0001,11.4479,1.0838,1.5764,10.428,2.4375,2.8094,0.0738,0.2099,0.501,6.997,0.636,1.6312,1.4334,7.228,0.454,6.5236,8.6956,2.6931,3.4459,3.6293,5.7569,2.6883,2.4966,0.3646,0.1241,4.8813,0.3483,4.3205,1.6406,5.6526,0.4045,2.5038,4.0926,5.42,0.3192,2.7239,3.0682,3.9567,0.0318,5.3602,0.7364,7.8885,1.8086,7.4888,0.0375,5.8202,0.0072,0.8084,1.8139,4.9924,4.6462,2.4904,6.0742,0.0555,1.842,2.415,2.5344,0.7716,1.8642,1.2788,5.5879,4.1605,1.967,4.9847,1.4977,3.2377,0.5318,7.5849,1.8862,4.9428,0.793,1.3933,2.7864,3.3804,0.7993,1.636,0.0015,2.6586,1.9247,1.7772,6.1018,5.0479,2.4468,0.0145,2.7913,3.7809,1.8068,1.6303,2.46,5.323,1.0348,3.3831,4.067,1.1779,3.7208,2.4143,1.1724,5.2836,0.0032,0.1561,0.0774,3.267,0.257,2.706,2.7517,4.2971,3.8536,5.5524,0.2886,3.9722,0.5508,5.927,0.0035,0.0639,5.1115,3.705,4.9625,5.2983,0.7213,4.5844,0.4311,0.2475,0.6937,0.704,0.0002,4.4833,3.7019,0.177,4.843,2.0915,5.5773,1.927,9.7042,0.0003,1.0538,4.9073,3.8064,17.1341,7.6372,4.1168,3.229,4.5837,7.0183,1.2137,1.7734,0.9136,2.4313,0.5253,1.6215,0.6611,3.7671,1.968,7.098,2.7066,5.5721,3.7367,2.918,3.7601,4.9328,0.0087,0.8397,0.829,8.2635,2.8511,2.4119,6.4313,0.1411,0.922,7.1173,4.9043,6.3928,4.5434,0.2461,3.7119,0.0221,1.4531,0.9606,0.0002,3.3576,3.417,2.5188,4.2959,2.8325,3.6782,2.3704,1.1561,1.7354,2.242,5.2133,0.1401,3.7229,0.7162,2.4696,5.2883,0.4382,4.5751,5.1349,0.3089,3.555,1.9798,1.0167,1.4435,3.4246,0.0662,1.0472,2.8295,0.8392,0.5047,0.0265,0.0521,1.743,3.2396,1.1383,4.7657,0.1688,3.7493,1.8615,6.0201,3.4745,1.7776,5.2209,3.1421,7.5187,5.1189,2.6039,3.9713,0.2653,0.073,4.7647,5.1242,2.7994,0.8335,0.4491,1.7141,2.0901,6.5412,3.6786,2.3706,5.5617,6.0032,3.1868,2.8334,2.2368,0.8758,2.4908,3.7912,0.4396,2.7208,0.27,0.1212,0.2765,6.7694,0.4139,1.5539,4.559,1.5903,7.0397,2.3281,1.7797,4.1,0.7339,2.4195,0.2688,2.1642,0.0441,1.2156,2.115,1.376,3.6452,1.5992,2.4614,0.2657,2.6644,4.9817,1.0468,0.3211,0.1592,0.2405,0.0001,3.0528,0.4569,2.7357,8.9147,0.183,5.3674,4.7823,1.089,0.9619,2.1039,3.2529,0.8214,0.3992,0.5339,1.5039,0.2077,1.8055,2.3465,0.6426,0.708,5.7762,0.5141,3.7954,0.9002,1.9541,2.3229,2.4596,3.834,3.1782,0.5579,5.7087,1.3955,2.5532,0.7437,2.353,0.6334,7.5372,0.7249,2.5745,3.9363,0.7817,5.191,1.6526,4.0131,1.3843,0.735,2.8241,2.499,1.7643,3.6517,1.0713,1.1931,4.8114,2.1798,6.8646,7.0265,6.8839,1.9497,2.6307,1.7989,1.068,3.2811,6.3597,5.3895,1.8234,2.218,4.1336,6.1186,2.6366,2.5463,1.7104,1.1077,0.8074,4.2044,5.0754,0.1553,2.3799,0.7824,5.245,1.8223,1.0298,6.2832,5.7526,1.4366,1.1785,2.1366,0.5336,1.846]}

She then arranges to have Stacey killed by a third party in custody. She tells a fellow inmate that if he can manage to bribe one of the prison\u2019s warders, he could buy a sheet and a bucket of cement. The inmate, Billy, sets about getting in touch with the man in authority, telling him that his mother is dying of cancer and that Stacey will help Billy pay out on a life insurance policy.

{"id":2261,"ended":false,"length":327,"text":"The U.S. Millionaire's basic set is a direct adaptation of the British version's set design, which was conceived by Andy Walmsley. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. Millionaire clothing line expired on March 30, 2001, after which he was replaced by current design partner, the PSE agency, who started selling a complete look for their contestant-owned, contestant-driven U.S. Millionaire brand (which had grown to rival the BBC program). The main feature of the American set design includes much larger elements, especially the \"muffin top\" that is seen on the female contestants and the \"peacock feathers\" that appear on male contestants as part of their initial suit. In the British version, these were rarely seen, as contestants preferred not to appear ostentatious to their fellow contestants.\n\nSince Paul Smith has become a leading designer in the U.S., the PSE agency licensed the \"Paul Smith\" label to various companies, among them is the U.S. Millionaire brand. In turn, contestants were allowed to continue to use the full \"Millionaire\" name, with the exception that contestants could not use the first series of the program as their source for the Millionaire look. All the other items have been redesigned to match the U.S. Millionaire brand, while retaining the \"pennies\" (as seen on the U.K. version) or \"fluff\" (as seen in the U.K. version) logo. For this reason, some garments use the \"USM\" rather than \"UKM\" tag to indicate the change in logo and\/or design.

They discussed the situation in the Southwest Pacific Area and made many points of common interest.","token_len":380,"entropy":[8.8571,4.0978,0.2759,8.4435,5.2259,4.0082,7.8218,1.8881,1.9712,4.4405,3.7539,12.4498,3.4848,12.6664,8.6105,6.5246,6.0145,6.0615,7.259,4.3858,2.7837,2.5934,3.8161,1.0398,0.3713,2.1024,0.5055,3.998,11.0354,3.4183,1.2914,1.7192,5.8902,0.0942,2.1887,6.0053,5.8621,5.0603,1.1093,2.0361,1.2072,3.2721,0.6023,7.9508,5.205,2.7773,1.7425,4.8128,0.0036,2.301,4.8842,1.4755,3.7981,2.3815,6.7517,0.0301,1.2491,3.1997,0.9194,4.0895,1.567,5.2862,3.4765,0.0227,9.505,8.7669,3.4046,0.9313,3.3952,1.8992,10.681,0.4021,0.0193,5.2253,2.7207,0.0266,3.7544,5.4567,2.5109,2.9994,0.1786,2.6439,0.0045,0.001,2.3537,5.1053,3.853,2.4721,1.7884,2.8549,0.0513,9.6922,0.1893,0.0008,0.2807,1.346,3.3588,0.6215,4.5867,4.7883,0.0193,3.557,1.8648,6.267,0.2933,13.9747,4.2723,2.1555,2.9873,4.1821,3.8588,6.2444,8.0901,5.2148,2.1939,2.5683,5.9977,4.8711,4.1095,1.718,4.1106,6.6023,1.945,2.6897,4.8363,1.9644,1.6369,1.8044,0.5205,7.7583,0.3998,2.9738,5.4949,2.9884,0.0862,0.3758,1.819,0.0003,1.8816,4.1986,3.2562,0.4181,0.1144,1.4515,0.0013,0.002,4.8288,2.8631,6.5756,5.2864,7.6254,5.6312,1.4353,3.7368,4.096,0.1419,6.5269,3.3075,4.2906,2.2876,0.2784,3.9882,1.6995,5.9098,3.5881,0.9771,0.3002,1.8101,0.0343,6.0699,0.6446,3.1564,3.0212,6.5989,1.291,4.0731,0.0003,0.758,1.1398,0.0012,0.0008,1.8706,0.4178,1.6172,1.8313,6.3041,0.3568,2.7155,0.9891,2.9487,5.4774,2.3956,5.7182,2.3998,1.05,0.5271,1.5656,0.0765,2.9472,2.8461,5.2561,3.6656,3.3038,5.4294,4.6366,1.9013,0.5847,7.7346,3.0122,4.0743,3.1748,3.3713,2.9712,0.8463,0.1493,1.5784,0.9727,1.6405,0.0002,2.6915,2.0341,3.4556,1.2267,0.6574,2.3791,4.7327,1.5646,1.0353,4.8562,6.5082,0.1249,0.6924,0.0008,0.0023,1.6772,0.512,1.1793,1.0224,4.374,5.6902,4.084,0.6775,6.891,6.8753,2.715,1.7844,3.6405,10.4852,3.0009,1.5699,5.9709,1.7696,3.5652,0.0347,1.467,0.8363,6.6716,2.5186,0.1943,6.7637,1.9582,0.0813,1.7474,4.4957,2.3824,1.6591,0.3543,2.941,0.6079,0.0034,4.3964,0.3111,0.7323,3.539,7.1127,6.5786,3.2605,2.1814,0.2492,4.3701,1.1863,3.8407,5.892,6.478,1.1367,2.7086,5.1543,3.5697,5.2098,3.3848,0.0007,0.0011,0.0672,0.6415,3.4556,4.6313,0.9262,4.668,5.2978,2.5393,2.4226,2.7873,1.7826,6.2528,3.4916,4.3515,1.2916,1.231,4.6524,0.7381,0.7002,0.7084,1.8701,6.092,1.3351,0.2661,6.3011,0.0052,1.8756,1.8552,3.2674,3.177,0.2983,2.17,4.426,3.5947,8.5615,4.4833,1.7399,0.1586,0.2147,2.8369,1.2907,5.8276,6.1402,4.852,1.8294,1.0235,3.0671,2.3681,3.0957,4.7102,4.7778,0.7242,0.9427,3.051,4.6573,4.903,2.0584,6.0648,0.8448,0.2036,1.8824,2.1443,7.194,2.5496,2.4189,0.0053,0.8909,0.7827,0.0051,0.5868,5.7517,1.6489,0.9718,3.8061,1.2956,0.5961,2.1415,0.0421,3.6446,1.3591,4.993,5.115,3.7026,1.0501,4.083,1.1099,0.5584]}
{"id":3580,"ended":true,"length":331,"text":"According to National Geographic's report, the story of `` Archaeoraptor `` begins in July 1997 in < unk >, China, where farmers routinely dug in the shale pits with picks and shovels, according to the report. On July 11, a farmer named Li Ming found a fossilized skull that he later identified as a raptor, according to BBC News (via io9 ). Li showed the skull to another farmer, Chen Tao, who called the local National Geological Survey of China. According to the BBC, the researchers soon verified the find as a dinosaur.\n\nThe skull has since been on and off of display, including at one point at the Quanzhou Geopark museum in China before it was returned to the Nanling fossil display site in 2000 because the place where it was on display was not sufficiently secure. The skull is part of the exhibit at a local mining museum in Guangdong City, China.\n\nIt has also been on display at the Nanling Dinosaur Museum and Research Institute in Chongqing. Archaeoraptor, according to the National Geographic report, would fit into the same group as the Utahraptor and Dilongosaurus.\n\nThe first dino to be found in China was the dinosaur, Gigantopelta. Archaeoraptor is believed to be the oldest known raptor in Asia.\n\nIn addition to this skull, archaeologists have found other fossilized dinosaur bones in the region, including bones of the Velociraptor. Researchers claim that this dinosaur was able to use tools -- for example, excavating dinosaur fossils.\n\nIt was not clear why the specimen was not immediately identified as a dinosaur. There is no standard test for dinosaurs in China. However, the Chinese believe that dinosaur fossils take the form of human bones or bones of animals that resemble humans in other areas of the world.","token_len":380,"entropy":[1.9909,7.0253,1.6796,2.8386,4.1883,0.3555,1.7381,6.6605,1.2476,12.2182,14.9735,6.4214,1.2252,0.6934,5.1747,5.622,1.8222,5.8833,5.2621,3.12,10.4977,11.1931,5.802,5.2829,5.9826,6.4768,1.1665,1.6325,7.585,8.4197,6.3325,3.7087,1.6596,9.0581,5.5039,4.3526,9.2441,0.8866,0.8708,0.0267,1.8528,5.5955,0.0026,1.342,1.889,0.2107,5.0582,2.1014,3.3973,0.1378,2.7927,3.4354,2.0323,4.4707,4.2328,5.1981,1.1143,6.0894,1.2517,2.8879,3.2572,2.0919,5.1922,2.6822,0.1728,1.2718,9.4018,0.0037,1.8211,2.5414,0.0016,7.609,1.09,5.2034,3.7646,7.5845,0.0263,2.32,3.9709,6.7474,0.7243,1.6926,0.1954,5.6591,0.3675,1.1351,5.8138,6.6982,0.4739,0.51,4.7069,1.615,5.0989,7.0712,5.2129,2.1786,4.422,0.6791,2.3639,3.1583,0.0008,1.0635,2.8172,0.6347,1.2519,5.2338,5.732,6.8821,0.9698,3.6956,4.34,2.4011,3.1825,1.1491,3.1877,0.2842,1.9843,4.7582,3.5854,2.3106,0.2529,6.4457,9.2019,0.3998,7.0277,3.7401,2.7279,3.3505,1.5018,5.0257,2.4509,1.9987,0.7512,8.3376,3.6705,0.0152,5.3164,4.3034,3.3019,2.5877,0.9521,1.4605,7.0445,1.8461,0.2044,4.7463,0.1957,1.1808,10.659,9.3807,8.626,6.6524,3.7897,1.353,5.0472,7.6173,1.8347,8.1719,4.0985,0.5815,0.2534,8.571,0.0133,0.9552,2.5512,4.9031,3.379,0.7549,1.8173,3.2151,1.7969,4.5996,0.0025,1.6541,4.4307,1.7674,3.9436,3.3913,7.1817,1.9869,1.4041,3.204,0.9859,0.0004,3.9092,0.9247,1.6908,0.8367,1.4144,0.0003,4.3547,3.0368,1.7469,0.2502,3.6034,0.1353,0.4261,0.8785,5.0325,0.0122,6.0495,0.6644,2.7266,5.0254,2.1264,0.7234,5.373,0.0056,0.0052,1.9216,7.0379,0.2591,0.0037,0.2991,3.114,3.5154,0.0009,0.8825,2.7634,0.0413,0.4115,0.0673,6.2612,5.7714,1.6254,1.053,2.984,4.2297,0.7952,1.1648,10.2885,9.5591,0.769,0.0498,3.191,11.5856,5.6708,2.4877,1.2767,1.2582,0.0003,1.9392,4.6086,9.0393,0.4542,1.9633,1.106,1.7925,1.0542,1.29,0.9668,2.4612,4.3845,3.4075,8.8735,1.2233,5.3645,10.3848,2.3503,6.3503,0.026,0.0004,0.0025,2.3072,2.7712,0.0128,1.4484,0.9784,2.36,1.1154,5.1046,0.019,2.1549,4.0418,0.8722,1.8112,0.0003,3.3295,3.1549,0.1588,4.4357,6.2486,0.2291,2.9689,1.0558,1.3867,2.4084,2.7138,0.2857,1.8071,0.8923,1.8785,1.232,2.3365,1.5584,0.4501,4.095,0.8458,2.0727,6.7983,0.357,0.0323,0.0003,0.0136,2.8886,5.1065,5.626,0.9687,2.1845,1.6259,1.1323,4.356,0.0038,4.4072,5.3765,7.5079,4.998,0.3928,0.4608,7.4955,0.1176,7.3586,3.433,3.4634,0.9014,0.0002,4.4643,2.8103,2.6772,2.2298,3.5753,0.9727,4.882,0.7,2.5054,4.9829,1.5362,0.8937,0.6569,1.1195,1.1322,4.7962,1.5779,1.2304,6.4176,5.9353,0.7296,4.6326,2.3634,0.5284,1.1039,2.3483,0.0127,1.7616,3.9099,6.4172,0.4366,3.9109,1.208,7.5824,3.5495,0.2956,0.0359,4.7893,1.2739,2.5538,3.2594,0.9772,1.8366,2.5884,5.3916,2.5085,4.1037,4.4093,4.025,1.1721,0.3468,0.1047,0.309]}
{"id":4339,"ended":false,"length":351,"text":"As the rebel forces advanced towards his enemy's line, Alexios's flankers sprung their ambush. Their attack did indeed cause some initial confusion, but Bryennios ( or, according to the game, Pashalikos, I forget which he goes by ) had an equally ambitious plan to draw the attack away while he himself rushed behind an advancing force, outflanking them from their flank, and opening a rout to the capital.\n\nOne of the effects of not having the historical Bryennios name is that the AI seems, in some cases, to get less ambitious and to make better decisions and use of terrain. Pashalikos, in turn, is much more disciplined and the troops ( from all of Bryennios's mercenary companies ) and men of his personal guard work very well to form a cohesive front, making it much harder for the enemy to break them.\n\nAlso a problem encountered by the AI when attacking Bryennios is that many of the units ( and that is in most areas, both of the game and the game engine ) don't seem to be able to attack into walls. The AI attacks through walls, but it does not seem to have the same problem with defenders in the same area, if the AI manages to breach the wall, the defenders within seem to be able to attack, but in many battles I have observed ( in this battle, the AI tried to attack at least 25 times through the same walls ) nothing happened : the AI just lost men and time.\n\nWhile I was working on my post, I added a couple of screenshots that show my AI troops at work, both on the flanks ( a screenshot shows the battle between the two forces advancing in the southern side ) as well as Bryennios's forces, which are attacking through the front, but first, this is a map of the battle :","token_len":380,"entropy":[2.9307,9.5144,2.1768,4.6542,3.847,5.6239,8.2086,1.5434,5.1935,0.9544,8.9739,5.0518,4.4803,7.4143,5.1031,7.3618,4.7531,5.3403,1.5832,4.497,4.1675,5.2893,6.0651,3.1321,2.6891,6.5484,2.8186,1.1412,1.0973,9.9969,9.2055,7.6971,7.4057,11.8648,3.6516,6.9162,0.0007,1.5879,4.7827,1.5205,5.7168,5.7395,6.2346,5.7228,3.1793,2.6318,6.4242,10.5082,2.5644,4.7037,8.2048,0.2102,3.9899,3.4643,4.3118,4.971,8.0628,0.2117,2.6302,5.7192,1.6092,6.0332,3.3144,6.6801,2.7635,4.5346,7.4561,5.661,6.2579,3.1328,4.1475,3.1008,6.4059,2.9755,0.0706,2.2763,4.063,4.3992,2.8386,3.0425,1.0547,6.1039,1.9909,8.2863,3.8605,0.9611,6.3946,0.8711,1.3015,0.5899,5.2668,0.6311,0.7782,8.1311,0.0622,6.7319,1.3078,1.9257,8.7112,12.5447,0.0452,0.0881,5.2635,2.4917,0.3214,1.9942,6.6973,5.7047,6.3725,1.996,2.8077,2.6169,0.2221,0.7473,5.687,6.1456,7.4181,2.5374,3.8026,3.6882,4.8735,2.102,4.3297,5.1283,6.0149,6.0694,1.3936,5.4165,0.122,0.0384,0.0107,0.0058,2.4439,2.9101,2.7477,0.0231,2.1992,4.1236,0.3926,5.4217,1.1914,5.0107,7.3649,5.8088,7.3273,4.2039,3.225,5.4168,0.0585,0.0073,0.3744,7.7243,4.2784,0.5539,5.0941,5.5404,3.318,1.3744,5.6522,3.2892,6.3282,3.0722,1.7149,2.0028,7.4246,1.2137,2.8058,2.6281,2.3709,4.151,1.7691,2.5531,1.9514,0.3267,0.9793,1.581,0.1156,4.1607,4.882,1.9671,1.1333,0.0003,5.3373,4.7878,4.4022,7.4252,1.0169,1.2975,1.0417,3.7491,3.7953,4.4644,0.0363,0.0082,1.7463,0.6394,5.0128,0.4068,1.1387,3.8677,3.6071,3.4864,6.2371,2.3515,4.7795,3.6097,5.7621,2.8871,6.0965,3.5854,2.1765,4.6952,0.9358,1.112,2.6598,4.8282,0.4179,3.5335,0.0012,3.1551,0.1359,1.8475,1.9784,0.0061,3.9977,6.0602,7.3026,2.0685,2.5513,1.0962,6.4029,3.4714,1.166,1.2226,1.3707,2.3437,2.3215,1.1839,2.0238,0.2716,1.9516,1.6696,2.8111,2.6278,1.4722,7.1681,3.683,1.6936,3.02,2.2032,1.9564,5.2103,2.7778,1.6609,4.3916,0.0262,4.4794,1.7471,1.1354,2.2738,2.411,1.8046,6.1725,5.7996,0.2925,0.9961,1.3739,0.006,2.9681,3.04,1.6623,3.943,3.0387,6.3418,5.5951,1.6983,4.7315,3.7214,4.6377,3.8797,4.598,1.8495,2.5324,0.5842,4.8338,0.2156,2.9976,4.3429,1.7348,6.2466,3.583,5.212,1.6391,3.707,2.8948,2.9512,6.754,2.6441,8.555,1.9591,0.6853,3.6644,4.9118,8.8797,1.3023,4.6921,0.9666,0.6132,0.0003,5.0402,2.3856,3.2051,3.5741,0.1787,3.1935,6.0157,2.8331,0.5584,6.4263,1.1232,2.9309,0.5028,4.7812,3.4861,1.6111,4.7646,3.8154,7.3721,4.4768,3.4125,2.0477,5.328,2.8368,0.792,7.9564,0.0288,3.4006,4.9695,4.2699,5.3187,1.4535,4.16,3.9366,1.4555,2.1549,3.5805,8.8908,2.8099,1.1645,6.6276,3.3684,3.2125,3.6871,0.0663,0.0069,7.8484,0.0955,0.0096,1.3703,4.235,2.9408,2.7705,2.1548,5.5379,3.4697,1.0395,3.831,2.4002,3.5235,8.3647,3.0656,5.6087,1.7013,1.9645,5.1491,1.7513,0.6939,2.8121,5.4163]}

The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along which they would have flown on their own. The first phase of the mission would have involved an interplanetary voyage of up to 4 months while the two spacecraft collected their first-ever, direct sampling of an asteroid. After an Earth-Moon-Mars gravity assist maneuver, the spacecraft would have rendezvoused with the Centaur and Agena, and the two bodies would make their way to the moon.\n\nIf and when the Gemini spacecraft makes it to the moon, we will be able to send science missions to sample comets and asteroids from the surface of the moon in a safe and efficient fashion. The astronauts aboard Apollo 11 will have left a foot print on the lunar surface, but a far more valuable space craft will have set down much farther out past the LCRG boundary and carried astronauts further away from Earth that any previous manned spacecraft has ever gone. Once astronauts have landed on the moon, further exploration of the moon will be made possible with the use of advanced robotic vehicles or landers that will have the same capabilities to travel in deep space and on other planetary bodies as have been developed for the ISS.\n\nA manned mission to Mars will require a huge investment in technology and engineering. Mars has an atmosphere and is home to a liquid water ocean at the South Pole that is more similar to Earth than any other planetary body of known size. There are abundant reserves of iron and of other materials found in asteroids that may be needed to make the necessary technology for the journey to Mars a reality. There is no need to try to build a space ark now, as we would need to do if we were to try to return life to Earth first.","token_len":380,"entropy":[12.8376,5.0107,5.5272,1.2635,7.7385,0.11,0.0018,0.0209,0.1885,14.4703,9.5452,0.1518,3.5363,7.3786,1.6333,7.3603,1.7068,2.9741,5.9768,0.8162,0.0213,1.4075,1.6224,4.0319,0.0222,1.5809,0.2258,6.0118,1.815,4.1061,4.5541,0.4042,0.0004,7.8031,1.1793,9.8696,2.6852,0.0378,0.0108,0.81,1.6584,5.9872,3.1989,2.5264,0.1153,0.2857,3.8512,4.1062,2.5149,1.9364,1.4261,1.5007,4.2925,5.4013,0.3881,0.4378,2.2795,0.2635,0.1204,2.1634,3.3253,3.7896,0.1757,0.0001,5.7407,3.0302,5.0284,0.0349,3.7846,6.3335,6.1498,0.463,4.6477,1.1205,9.4213,3.8776,3.0704,5.0943,0.0806,5.4922,7.5952,8.5882,0.1557,5.2256,1.3604,1.2411,4.8736,4.2402,5.2362,0.8013,2.6367,3.3564,3.3433,7.7566,6.3224,4.5244,1.0106,0.4348,1.3539,0.158,0.4309,4.2747,0.0032,0.0282,0.0736,0.3062,1.2805,1.8115,0.0107,1.0998,0.4347,0.0008,2.7532,2.0778,2.1351,2.4001,6.0422,0.0932,6.2231,1.5579,0.7753,1.0797,0.9482,2.5126,1.0419,0.8809,0.0007,4.8374,6.0144,0.0302,0.6466,2.861,0.6976,6.5255,2.3984,0.591,0.4492,0.4735,0.2246,5.1827,1.5753,1.8806,0.9542,0.0125,3.8619,6.61,3.2337,0.6219,8.4006,5.3799,0.0362,1.0558,0.7508,2.9018,1.1352,1.9821,0.3607,0.3125,0.5238,3.8514,2.1985,5.5313,0.9116,2.9704,3.3816,0.3631,2.1118,6.1451,3.2264,3.9778,1.3298,1.9268,2.2607,7.0998,3.5204,10.3857,5.5312,0.8544,0.541,1.8372,0.1294,1.6666,3.4066,4.4585,6.7192,1.4709,4.8319,5.0326,3.7192,1.1426,3.1819,6.1222,6.0351,8.8704,4.3428,3.2381,6.9588,0.6955,8.5321,4.0703,5.7759,4.7497,2.5866,6.1282,5.3561,6.3679,2.2799,0.6622,1.4043,5.9224,8.0163,5.6105,2.7802,2.4147,2.2681,2.487,3.4765,1.8046,5.4448,4.4757,1.7363,2.8043,0.9698,0.3217,0.5704,0.3209,7.7937,1.8616,0.9115,0.5427,1.6555,1.2982,1.2343,3.8078,1.0413,2.6554,1.0303,2.6514,0.0008,3.247,3.4216,3.6729,5.155,5.0732,0.5454,2.3468,1.2226,3.6534,2.1827,3.4572,1.6014,4.0292,4.1461,3.1951,4.1062,0.056,2.0566,4.122,2.5285,4.7265,0.584,2.8031,5.0145,0.7167,2.4959,1.4326,1.4548,5.6489,0.4581,0.5097,0.0002,4.0072,5.2831,1.3033,0.2087,2.5729,2.0507,1.69,1.6609,4.6895,3.0853,1.5707,2.111,1.0423,4.0666,1.4889,5.1858,2.5423,3.6305,3.7032,2.7028,3.3137,4.1433,0.0055,1.9117,5.7983,0.9859,1.3571,5.4804,1.0456,6.2951,0.0691,2.5179,1.6367,4.7365,5.9005,0.0814,2.7955,0.2994,3.3286,0.262,4.3969,0.2233,5.1556,6.7963,1.7109,0.4167,4.3127,0.7278,6.1042,5.2538,0.0275,6.0163,0.9742,8.1209,2.9702,3.0201,3.6663,0.8929,5.8044,3.0073,2.9996,1.0255,4.0152,0.6954,2.5135,1.9645,2.6544,3.8479,1.727,1.9129,4.5338,0.8415,0.3047,8.8796,0.2707,0.1266,4.1116,1.1526,2.1356,3.3783,0.6883,5.7012,0.5076,2.5083,0.7251,3.5353,10.8997,0.359,6.8793,1.1473,1.665,2.6874,4.4505,1.6138,0.5004,3.7833,5.8701,0.6484,0.949,0.3315,3.26,0.3151,3.63,6.201,0.425,1.3694,6.9149,0.2426]}
{"id":2923,"ended":true,"length":337,"text":"The nucleotide sequence of a gene's DNA specifies the amino acid sequence of a protein through the genetic code. Sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each correspond to a specific amino acid [ 1 ].\n\nGene Structure\n\nThe basic gene structure is illustrated, including a large promoter, a ribosome binding site, splicing-stop, and open reading frame coding units. (Credit: American Society for Microbiology).\n\nAnalogous to the natural world, a gene encodes a single-celled organism and is composed of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. DNA holds the information necessary for an organism to accomplish its function, while RNA is the intermediary for moving the information from DNA to amino acids. This process is known as translation. The information encoded in DNA determines a protein\u2019s amino acid sequence. The protein is folded into a more complex shape that corresponds to an active pathway (shown above) in the cell. Amino acid side chains, which are made of specific sets of four atoms known as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, are added and linked to one another, forming protein molecules that have the structure necessary for a cell function.\n\nTranscription and Translation\n\nThe information in the DNA molecule is expressed in many different ways. During transcription, an enzyme reads the DNA molecule and converts it into RNA molecules. These RNA molecules are then transported out of the nucleus and to ribosomes (pictured above). Ribosomes function as the cellular assembly line, where information is copied from one RNA molecule to another and protein-making machinery is organized. Many different proteins can be made from these RNA molecules, ranging from the tiny enzymes that carry out minor chemical reactions within cells to the giant multi-layered proteins that assemble the many parts of the cell.","token_len":380,"entropy":[12.269,1.2936,1.3666,1.3553,2.8862,3.8687,5.6248,4.4866,8.51,0.9951,4.8497,0.0686,0.657,0.796,2.5111,1.3963,8.1793,3.6996,6.98,1.2317,0.7148,11.6902,0.3141,5.1289,1.358,0.8425,0.0006,2.2011,3.5424,0.06,4.2792,0.1728,0.3307,4.3559,3.9071,0.0644,0.8681,2.8291,1.8167,0.0173,8.4521,4.2033,1.3212,1.9214,0.0005,4.8071,6.735,0.78,0.0002,1.391,4.7684,6.7946,0.3779,1.6862,4.0921,6.1284,5.693,2.4732,4.4277,7.715,1.8795,1.0213,6.497,0.8915,0.393,6.5551,0.2862,0.4251,7.5614,0.7508,6.8254,7.7713,1.1762,0.7581,9.1648,4.7562,0.8003,9.6678,5.3707,1.0498,5.3978,6.2421,0.0349,6.3702,2.5181,0.4667,2.1944,0.0192,4.2821,0.9119,0.0002,4.3095,3.9854,0.4206,1.2608,0.798,6.1923,3.8857,0.3545,2.4143,1.6141,6.3183,0.0003,0.6494,2.6873,4.9909,2.8475,0.0005,0.7739,3.9985,2.0375,3.7503,0.0844,5.6532,2.7652,6.5059,0.1453,0.0136,0.0544,0.0009,0.2966,0.1272,0.7832,0.5808,0.7513,0.2776,2.0727,0.6406,0.003,0.0473,0.007,1.9182,3.2828,0.5771,3.3837,8.4083,1.6151,2.6253,1.6775,1.1701,3.9695,0.0704,0.236,7.4246,0.9276,2.5318,1.7467,3.0367,0.038,1.8237,1.426,4.3174,2.8205,8.3065,1.9468,1.6641,2.3187,3.2927,0.2461,8.5534,0.2063,0.5782,4.1386,3.1719,1.0295,2.0025,0.011,3.9515,1.1074,2.1916,4.6692,3.6812,0.4929,2.3993,6.2004,3.2055,1.791,16.3119,7.436,5.5231,3.1171,0.0315,0.2258,1.0012,1.8062,2.8107,1.8073,6.001,0.6544,1.277,5.7321,1.4749,5.2172,3.3337,4.7601,0.0664,3.2337,5.6932,6.8401,2.838,5.9501,3.7262,1.7275,3.3734,0.7403,2.6378,0.855,7.4706,0.1226,2.1595,10.5793,0.8546,2.8114,1.7289,0.9686,4.9152,1.2639,6.2759,7.2129,0.0065,5.3477,6.2972,6.7213,0.038,6.5079,2.3047,4.5868,0.0518,2.7799,0.0807,0.2307,3.1475,0.1397,0.8382,5.7167,4.0476,6.8517,0.7453,4.1575,0.0721,2.8962,1.9119,5.1065,4.1595,2.3059,3.925,1.811,4.5789,4.6588,0.4606,2.0467,2.511,5.541,0.3736,1.3821,0.0002,5.5998,1.7646,2.9168,4.4223,0.503,0.0002,1.525,4.8344,3.0018,1.8483,2.4304,2.1479,0.7744,2.8193,0.9794,4.3437,0.506,0.8584,0.7375,6.9012,1.7615,0.2317,3.7903,1.6074,4.2937,1.0819,1.916,1.0107,1.3962,1.2286,0.2759,0.6583,3.171,5.5788,0.9495,3.3392,1.3872,0.0418,0.8155,1.3549,4.1647,4.6533,0.264,0.1422,4.9828,1.6115,4.2227,7.1434,0.0157,0.0323,2.5349,8.15,1.1287,0.9646,2.8526,0.0043,0.1499,5.2852,0.6899,2.2056,5.0141,5.719,2.5439,2.7871,1.7963,3.8148,0.6731,5.2016,1.2587,1.163,2.9687,0.0692,0.0832,0.211,2.0569,8.999,3.9528,4.8842,2.0668,0.7009,4.633,1.1732,6.1887,3.8154,1.5739,2.7194,0.207,3.1439,1.5276,2.8955,1.9113,0.0697,1.1352,5.2067,0.0604,2.7403,6.0853,5.4479,1.1985,4.027,0.505,9.7238,3.4976,0.3331,6.1571,1.6949,0.3145,0.6712,4.6803,6.6632,0.0555,5.5096,0.0003,1.163,0.3278,4.4025,2.2085,5.0466,5.063,0.069,1.1262,1.4835,0.7937]}
{"id":3330,"ended":true,"length":326,"text":"The Whig Party was also divided in Kentucky, not only between Clay and Taylor, but between gubernatorial candidates. William J. Graves, out of politics since his fatal shooting of Representative Cilley in the back on the floor of the US Senate, ran a much stronger campaign in the state than did Governor John S. Breckinridge. This may have been related to party infighting as well, as Graves defeated Breckinridge, Whig candidate for Congress Alexander N. Robertson, and Know-Nothing nominee John T. Walker.\n\nThis would make sense if Graves was running against Know-Nothings. In fact, it was Graves who started the Know-Nothing movement in Kentucky, which later grew into the American Party. It was originally the American Party because the Know-Nothings considered themselves to be Americans, not foreigners. The Know-Nothings would later join the Republican Party.\n\nWilliam Graves was born in 1821 in Kentucky. He was an army major by 1862. On the morning of March 4, 1862, he fired a pistol at representative William Cilley on the floor of the US Senate in a dispute over the abolition or extension of slavery. Graves was killed and Cilley was wounded.\n\nGraves was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Cilley, meanwhile, served in the US Senate until his death in 1913. Graves was originally nominated for the prize by James Buchanan in 1862, but he was denied out of a fear that he might become a \u201cslave hero \u201d. Buchanan also nominated General Robert E. Lee, but the award was not bestowed upon Lee at that time ( nor was it ever given by the Confederate Army.\n\nCilley was eventually the recipient of the Medal of Honor in 1897, making this the only double Medal of Honor recipient in the history of the prize.","token_len":380,"entropy":[9.5059,3.4844,1.8024,3.4903,4.4176,6.7958,2.5367,10.0621,1.234,6.2682,2.1894,4.1879,8.4921,1.3733,6.7654,0.5878,0.1087,0.5372,10.3498,0.8408,2.6456,7.2864,4.293,0.0667,9.2092,0.9149,8.8696,0.4493,7.8517,4.9861,3.5293,8.049,4.0546,1.509,6.5455,6.4915,6.9532,2.6097,5.0005,3.2399,3.9373,3.903,3.0475,5.3876,0.0581,0.4504,6.0195,1.4587,1.285,3.1924,3.3477,4.8417,2.3519,1.1396,2.342,1.7885,0.8163,2.052,3.3106,5.8082,3.2982,4.4287,0.0973,7.5979,1.3653,0.4042,0.0006,1.1235,4.7133,4.577,1.2005,0.9358,6.5624,0.3445,7.7095,6.9377,0.0009,4.2156,1.7382,1.606,1.2362,1.6023,6.0062,4.8351,0.0002,0.0043,0.0011,3.446,10.409,0.305,3.3369,1.9302,4.9263,9.6337,5.0523,0.8306,7.5563,1.0567,0.449,12.5078,3.8416,1.7709,6.171,3.1932,3.7618,0.2299,5.4692,0.6812,1.2447,0.003,4.6675,4.8838,3.1646,3.5233,1.5864,3.3235,1.8738,1.5778,1.8938,8.4832,0.0515,6.1429,0.0662,0.0022,2.4836,3.0883,1.721,0.0419,2.7206,2.5679,4.4265,0.5362,4.9447,0.758,4.3385,0.0207,2.9755,3.3583,1.5429,0.9737,1.2551,2.4239,4.5377,3.9762,0.3389,0.892,4.5711,3.5492,0.8828,3.1836,0.9101,6.7414,3.558,2.2493,0.7472,7.1077,2.5756,1.4415,0.0227,0.0865,0.019,0.0034,6.8323,0.79,1.149,0.0533,6.1432,1.3381,1.6428,3.4823,0.4639,2.2296,0.8893,0.0117,0.0539,0.0144,0.0011,3.6867,2.5279,4.513,0.9706,2.0394,0.1508,2.4395,1.2086,0.0002,5.1823,4.7086,2.12,3.0137,0.6388,3.6849,4.589,0.897,3.5315,1.0653,0.7122,1.4939,3.5967,6.1223,5.3593,6.0076,8.7977,1.2265,5.2346,1.7018,3.875,0.1208,2.6053,3.1542,0.4017,0.8174,0.1191,0.6619,5.8598,1.7779,3.7988,1.4395,9.9304,3.5119,3.2139,5.4231,0.0015,4.0476,0.5193,2.0514,0.0219,0.0679,0.682,0.178,3.2667,2.9674,4.8225,0.6753,1.6238,6.4991,7.1517,6.2923,0.0095,0.8494,0.5688,1.6725,1.4382,2.712,3.0655,5.7908,0.0029,0.0003,0.8319,3.0269,0.6657,1.8567,0.0001,3.3169,0.001,1.2582,8.7472,0.3285,0.0102,1.4046,0.2356,2.0496,0.0113,0.1518,2.3041,5.6318,0.0278,0.0005,2.2355,5.5216,0.0497,4.782,1.4971,0.2037,1.5227,2.275,2.6336,1.4337,0.3457,0.7229,5.3074,0.2788,1.9616,1.2111,6.6184,4.2707,1.1498,0.8803,8.2651,1.241,4.5853,3.7696,2.3347,4.689,0.9605,0.4655,1.757,1.2698,3.0378,8.984,0.0127,3.3738,2.6424,0.9883,1.0853,1.5625,3.2336,0.8548,16.1171,5.7122,7.7779,9.0103,2.2081,7.3548,1.9604,2.7244,4.212,2.6158,7.2359,3.2432,0.511,0.0288,0.1084,1.4914,2.9815,2.6067,5.1253,0.6419,2.8593,4.0721,2.6098,2.5881,4.4081,1.5442,0.1028,5.4241,11.3446,1.6509,0.5581,3.8541,1.5925,3.9321,0.8323,2.5822,3.2939,4.4249,1.602,0.0002,3.8909,0.1799,0.0002,1.1583,5.1344,6.2269,4.0282,0.0151,0.4853,0.7943,0.0232,0.0189,2.4178,6.7217,1.5612,6.271,6.3836,1.252,2.6446,8.3712,3.5207,0.8083,0.0111,3.4855,1.7168,0.9019,1.3371,0.0024,0.2213,9.3134,0.2975]}

{"id":2301,"ended":true,"length":317,"text":"Throughout 1917 the Admiralty was becoming more concerned about German efforts to sweep paths through the British @ - @ laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines in the Channel. The Admiralty decided to install floating minesweepers around the Channel, including a large fleet of minesweepers at Devonport, on the Western Approaches, and an army of smaller minesweepers on patrol around Dover and the English Channel. Minefields were laid in the Thames Estuary, and minesweepers were placed in the River Lee. The largest minefield was on and under the German minefields on the Heligoland and L\u00fctzow Bays. One of the problems was to use the minefields as effectively as possible because the German mines often did not explode as expected. The largest minefield laid in 1917 was on the Heligoland Bays with over 3,000 mines laid.\n\nIn October, the Admiralty decided on the need for additional minesweepers to supplement both fleet and patrol duties, due to increased German activity. In response the Admiralty began construction of two new minesweepers, each able to clear 500 mines, to be constructed at the Admiralty and launched in the second half of 1917....\n\nOn 5 October 1917 the first batch of minefield equipment arrived as part of the planned programme. Five large ships were brought in from the West Indies, the largest of them, the 3,600-ton liner, Risdon of Glasgow, being able to load a total of 15 of the large mine-sweepers. The ship had been lying at Bermuda since arriving there in May after completing the Panama Canal run [which she had been ordered to do as part of her armament programme] and was able to take on board 15 mine-sweepers, two of them large ships.","token_len":380,"entropy":[11.7554,2.8622,7.8632,0.029,2.6069,7.1912,1.7815,3.7946,1.5741,6.0388,6.412,0.3201,7.9364,13.0036,1.1508,0.9859,3.5701,15.4175,8.5408,5.3543,11.5472,6.5028,3.9186,10.5738,0.5835,7.9647,1.4312,7.602,0.0517,1.0956,8.3261,1.372,1.2849,2.659,6.0475,2.786,3.0121,0.7349,4.3066,0.6681,1.9428,1.043,0.0078,2.883,0.5862,6.4942,7.6667,2.9692,3.8037,0.1659,0.0122,4.9458,0.6198,3.0107,2.1711,5.1645,2.5206,3.7872,5.5682,0.2118,3.9914,0.0571,0.2222,0.0012,3.0521,6.2607,0.2981,1.6717,3.5636,0.9771,5.9894,7.9924,0.1483,3.1057,1.9845,5.1764,4.3443,0.1694,6.5485,1.6517,0.0046,0.0715,0.0023,2.2895,10.2032,3.5941,5.1451,2.1941,2.7781,4.1089,0.0848,0.3203,8.5754,1.0766,0.8298,4.7802,2.131,1.5764,4.8855,5.6846,0.0038,1.4869,2.1927,3.2186,0.1749,0.1796,0.0046,0.6884,2.6691,1.4353,0.7577,4.7853,10.4661,1.4908,1.57,7.0611,1.6847,0.771,1.294,3.4793,7.3347,5.0262,1.0924,7.1061,6.2065,1.0221,2.7308,0.8799,9.428,4.7283,0.1676,2.5925,5.0498,5.834,4.8984,5.912,6.6466,2.0991,1.0156,5.1332,0.7266,0.1906,6.6222,1.934,3.9776,5.282,1.2439,3.7436,0.7992,1.7915,8.4889,0.1033,0.0622,5.0675,1.4217,2.797,1.8458,8.5569,3.582,0.1133,5.3569,3.1903,3.4167,0.5818,1.4576,6.9151,0.7944,0.2049,5.245,1.7999,4.7338,0.4519,1.5032,0.622,3.7293,0.0026,0.0012,5.5925,0.0313,4.6749,3.9103,3.6625,0.1812,0.4422,1.147,3.5923,1.2184,3.333,0.1773,2.5317,3.4278,2.8052,2.2752,0.7502,0.0083,1.8402,4.5366,1.7191,5.0434,0.8047,4.0008,1.1709,1.3822,0.1563,0.0043,2.0627,5.4773,6.6547,6.5005,1.2239,4.8438,3.7098,2.71,5.6149,0.1264,3.91,2.9954,1.8179,2.8716,2.461,3.9471,2.3936,0.229,0.0064,3.9066,3.3835,0.374,3.1735,2.0397,1.3526,0.1032,0.0848,0.0047,1.6773,4.574,7.0106,0.0099,7.0325,5.758,3.4219,3.1033,4.295,1.8758,5.2223,2.1848,1.9906,3.4581,0.0031,4.7525,9.3119,2.0785,1.8931,5.8897,0.4397,0.0043,1.7915,11.1156,1.1627,0.0003,2.924,4.1944,2.1829,1.1412,0.9293,4.0722,4.8017,0.0239,1.2009,2.7009,4.7335,3.6354,5.7904,1.3177,0.0008,0.5331,6.7188,7.6019,1.9861,7.0864,5.0752,4.8292,1.2516,4.4333,1.2313,1.8837,1.1605,4.3831,0.7875,1.4943,3.3541,3.501,1.0426,2.9853,3.474,1.0265,6.0967,0.9211,3.5231,1.718,0.3895,7.3281,2.5656,5.6923,6.6861,5.5096,5.3862,7.3165,1.1649,3.9561,6.3095,0.0048,6.2796,3.3681,1.43,0.0379,4.4911,6.136,0.9706,4.6621,2.2126,4.1492,5.7114,0.2679,0.0337,1.1053,1.3068,3.1624,3.2177,1.5674,7.0084,2.8127,9.2403,2.6652,7.7987,4.1332,1.1192,3.3306,6.2714,4.4634,1.7614,8.2365,0.1436,6.7076,7.0423,4.5688,5.1146,1.29,1.9999,4.063,0.1395,1.1562,3.7866,0.92,0.0007,2.1094,7.5061,0.8317,2.3338,2.1123,1.1671,1.4257,4.7171,0.0227,3.6511,3.4106,4.5135,5.5921,4.0477,0.8018,0.3354,0.0867,0.0017,2.4465,3.5072,1.2433,1.882,4.8047,5.2676,1.2116]}

Among his clients after moving to Frankfort was Republican Attorney General Alben Barkley, who defended Crittenden against the impeachment charges brought by the state Senate while he was still a congressman. Crittendon later represented Barkley's law partner, former Gov. John Y. Brown Jr.\n\nCrittenden served as a lawyer for former governor and U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond for more than 25 years, but he and Thurmond never spoke of their relationship except once when he wrote Thurmond a letter thanking him for support after Thurgood Marshall's death. The two also never met. Once in Congress as senator, Thurmond introduced him as 'Mr. Crittenden, a friend'.\n\nCrittenden also handled the defense for a black police captain in Jacksonville, Florida, who was convicted of fraud in 1954, and for a former Ku Klux Klan grand dragon who was trying to get his $20,000 bail reduced with a handwritten plea for 'lives and limbs' of his wife and daughter. Crittenden wrote on the bail application :\n\n'The Captain is one of the most honest, law-abiding people I have ever known. During his entire career, he has never been charged or arrested for a criminal offense. His ability to perform the duties of a police officer is outstanding.

The case was dismissed in absentia by the Los Angeles Superior Court on March 30, 2005.[23][24] She filed a lawsuit against him in 2005 for making false accusations in his countersuit, but a jury found in Fisher's favor on October 26, 2006.[25] Fisher said that he was willing to donate money if Paula felt she was in need.[26]\n\nIn December 2007, he testified against a former friend of his, John Mark Karr, in Karr's trial on charges of killing JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey and to support charges relating to child pornography.

After moving across the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea without development, the system moved through the Intertropical Convergence Basin on August 30. The system then moved northwestward and into the Gulf of Mexico. A broad area of low pressure is associated with the tropical wave in the Western Gulf of Mexico on September 6, and tropical storm formation is possible in the next 12 to 24 hours.\n\nOn the evening of August 27, a tropical wave moved east-northeastward across the northwestern coast of Africa into the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. On Friday morning, the wave became better organized as it passed over the Lesser Antilles, and it moved into the central Caribbean Sea on Saturday and was centered near 15.7N 64.7W. The system moved into the Intertropical Convergence Basin and turned to the northwest while moving parallel to the eastern coast of Central America.\n\nOn August 30, the cyclone moved ashore in Belize and dissipated there late on the same day.\n\nForecasts on the system were revised several times in the period August 21\u201329. A series of synoptic and tropical wave forecasts placed the system in a position favorable for development near the Lesser Antilles where dry air was expected to inhibit intensification. At least four models showed strong development within less than 10 days.\n\nAfter moving over the northern Lesser Antilles on September 1, a tropical wave moved southwestward and entered the Eastern Caribbean Sea on September 4. On September 5, the system emerged into the Bay of Campeche, and on the next day, a tropical depression was located about 140 miles south-southwest of Brownsville, Texas. The depression moved ashore in southwestern Texas early on the morning of September 6 and dissipated southwest of Matagorda Bay.","token_len":380,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,6.6992,5.0789,0.5811,7.0781,0.3687,0.1042,4.1758,4.3594,0.8144,2.7876,0.8537,1.5908,4.3346,3.1347,1.3053,5.8588,4.0207,4.1612,0.4814,0.8685,3.3606,5.5463,2.4115,7.4512,9.5544,0.6449,0.7364,7.4607,4.2435,4.4236,0.8251,8.9609,0.9849,0.0016,0.2366,0.0683,7.0178,2.813,0.8034,4.7462,0.8901,1.7146,2.0808,4.2424,1.0425,4.2433,0.9202,2.8241,3.447,0.302,2.4205,0.1181,0.1164,1.9044,4.1221,7.1185,3.9448,0.5135,4.7456,0.9636,3.5647,4.4268,0.0222,0.7339,3.7525,1.9391,4.3379,0.7867,5.7627,4.0279,0.5827,0.02,4.1515,0.9731,2.9161,1.6147,1.9879,5.6612,2.9654,4.051,1.477,5.7891,1.4223,0.561,7.4245,4.0647,2.1766,1.0679,0.0443,0.2702,1.3502,0.0007,4.5687,3.0724,4.0543,0.012,1.1924,3.5821,0.1596,2.0632,1.561,1.9219,1.8954,2.5962,4.085,2.7049,0.0323,0.0063,2.2025,2.8058,0.2721,5.6489,1.1093,0.0125,0.5336,2.2558,0.0465,0.7085,3.7022,1.7259,0.3309,0.9464,3.3888,6.2716,4.0205,0.2642,1.1873,3.7223,5.7707,8.4559,4.9112,3.267,0.2935,3.6533,2.0229,0.7572,10.1454,0.1827,1.0594,0.033,1.8287,2.0365,2.5671,1.3961,2.7032,0.3213,4.1864,3.3115,1.724,1.6166,1.0243,3.0984,3.9327,4.8438,2.4852,9.9101,4.2645,2.6807,6.3054,10.013,1.0878,2.231,0.6451,1.5697,1.5778,2.3534,1.1887,2.7832,0.2297,7.5712,0.0618,0.0086,0.0092,0.0013,0.038,3.7838,5.8598,4.2076,0.716,3.7277,6.054,1.3767,8.8551,0.2892,0.2656,4.0149,1.5885,0.1936,4.5197,0.7279,0.7747,1.3407,0.0002,1.3696,2.1557,1.8099,0.126,1.0479,5.9561,0.2685,2.7036,6.7975,1.5843,8.0545,0.0648,1.3941,7.7206,0.0081,6.5988,6.4669,1.671,1.6164,2.4633,0.1449,0.3702,1.7392,0.0003,5.1043,1.4783,5.1561,0.775,4.1274,3.402,4.0664,6.6749,1.0736,2.6574,0.6181,5.7804,3.9534,4.2411,3.627,2.918,0.9393,3.5744,4.5222,0.0077,9.1527,0.4531,0.059,2.7416,3.3642,3.3935,4.3156,6.8229,0.9079,0.7284,1.7226,1.552,3.3494,6.2777,0.747,2.9768,5.9647,0.5475,9.1398,0.0044,0.0139,0.0,6.4842,8.1495,2.8823,4.0919,1.8059,0.3391,8.5439,10.5672,0.156,1.5259,4.8338,2.7806,3.2152,5.004,4.0687,3.7076,5.6682,4.963,6.9134,0.0162,3.1079,1.1795,1.5193,1.1992,0.0003,5.972,3.5755,3.614,0.5177,3.9375,8.5269,0.2002,0.0232,0.0,2.2216,1.3464,2.4385,0.2015,2.0552,0.8223,0.3334,0.538,3.0874,0.3916,2.0766,4.001,0.1859,3.7297,2.3933,0.528,0.8662,0.6286,2.5089,0.305,2.5756,1.1558,1.7166,0.2379,0.8164,0.8914,7.8362,2.7181,0.2542,7.917,0.1041,6.2122,0.2179,0.0163,1.745,1.6044,2.7883,2.9345,2.8926,0.1752,0.7893,1.6996,0.7151,9.6204,3.0178,4.2829,3.9309,5.7289,1.0703,2.1293,1.8839,1.0441,0.2629,0.0872,9.845,0.2012,0.3751,1.8873,0.3018,1.8664,5.1805,3.5653,6.7378,1.9322,5.8464,2.8409,5.1061,0.6923,1.9869,0.6333,0.0194,0.1465,1.3672,1.5316,3.875,0.0017,8.6576,2.4176,9.1235,2.0359,0.0338,0.0309,3.8821,1.5107]}

Although generally favorable upper level winds were expected with the approach of the cyclone to Grand Turk, the cyclone was nevertheless expected to encounter very windy and rough conditions on the island.\n\nThe low level circulation quickly became increasingly better defined as it continued to move towards the north-northwest, but the cyclone had lost its initial deep convection and deep ridging to the east. After briefly making landfall over Grand Turk on June 12 at 18Z, the cyclone crossed a very strong outflow near 19Z and quickly dissipated near 20Z as is fell into very windy conditions over the island. The deep convection around the low rapidly dissipated once the cyclone crossed the island, with the exception of small pockets, or squalls, of convection that persisted to the north and northeast.\n\nImpact :\n\nAt 18Z on June 12, the cyclone developed into a tropical depression as it moved towards the north-northwest. At 18Z, the cyclone made landfall at Grand Turk, and after crossing outflow and transitioning to westerlies, the circulation rapidly dissipated into a remnant low pressure area over the island. Rain bands wrapped towards the northeast at ~ 30 - 40-mph, reaching a 40% coverage. With the strong outflow in place, the rain bands did not drop much heavy rain in the island. However, wind gusts over Grand Turk were between 40 - 48-mph sustained.","token_len":380,"entropy":[5.3423,9.7051,10.4112,6.4272,5.1848,0.0279,1.32,9.3596,1.1754,7.3212,7.6163,1.7757,4.7065,6.469,13.6815,7.276,7.6464,7.3937,7.9369,2.0494,0.004,4.4785,9.4463,0.3639,1.6611,5.021,3.1204,2.9747,8.3039,2.0031,1.368,4.8515,2.2013,3.4359,6.9339,7.9476,0.5497,1.4216,8.4175,4.9184,4.2728,5.4491,5.0862,5.0185,10.9434,8.2443,3.1643,8.2065,1.85,3.626,4.2101,6.018,6.5222,2.1297,1.4156,7.2956,3.1409,1.3243,7.1297,1.1661,7.4084,7.2905,11.5016,4.5986,1.2702,2.5116,2.0307,2.2478,0.1085,7.4053,5.2828,1.3711,3.7941,5.5797,6.0771,3.3119,1.8184,2.6217,4.1916,0.7797,4.0028,3.1591,3.4687,0.0585,1.1225,6.0232,8.0258,6.3843,9.0223,3.6486,3.5225,2.3163,3.4355,4.5453,2.1074,8.1746,1.5011,1.2695,6.2624,0.2486,5.2352,7.4196,0.0021,0.4667,1.3315,4.1342,0.0444,2.2439,7.0277,3.6882,0.075,5.5431,3.8759,5.512,0.0744,3.1104,5.7316,0.824,3.2079,1.379,5.5005,1.3522,2.0631,0.0753,1.3942,5.6157,1.8524,5.3663,6.827,3.7203,4.539,7.6053,4.6071,1.6134,1.431,2.9886,0.6135,2.0296,2.459,0.325,1.3056,0.7701,0.5789,0.0099,1.8845,3.0988,2.1865,3.0655,0.0158,4.0269,5.2126,2.3283,4.2024,8.2633,4.7269,0.8213,1.7949,7.0962,5.1423,3.0845,2.9667,0.8583,2.6818,0.9441,4.6433,6.7108,5.4366,1.6218,4.7576,2.9005,0.0054,1.8154,0.4691,4.1206,3.5049,3.6058,9.1361,0.4705,0.452,1.8811,0.0057,6.166,2.8456,3.9848,3.7067,7.1179,0.1725,4.5114,8.5879,0.3891,2.1355,4.4489,4.0154,0.0046,5.651,1.9467,0.0135,3.4865,7.2163,15.3614,4.2823,7.2988,3.5054,0.0356,0.7164,4.3092,0.6715,2.2721,0.3645,1.4616,6.0208,2.1279,0.0327,5.4036,0.9645,4.2166,11.8981,2.8779,0.0058,6.1496,1.26,2.1593,0.0052,2.801,0.8527,4.5758,1.6764,3.7294,1.3941,6.3559,0.0405,5.2451,2.5656,4.9951,5.5805,7.2525,0.0898,0.471,2.2521,3.3762,0.1306,2.4681,3.0753,3.8607,0.9104,1.6079,2.682,2.9276,1.6416,1.3491,0.0002,7.438,0.6861,8.0493,2.2508,0.0002,4.2332,3.6665,0.8775,4.6621,0.2165,1.7075,0.4039,0.7908,2.1278,0.0073,4.9959,2.5308,0.2629,2.3127,0.3034,4.1928,0.5249,1.8501,1.3589,0.2846,0.7154,0.2835,0.1901,0.0072,1.0576,3.2528,2.8526,0.8072,1.595,0.8828,1.8553,0.0062,4.7737,0.6536,2.1709,7.2085,0.0033,1.7362,2.1131,4.6293,4.1568,6.995,1.4115,2.7562,10.0241,1.1696,8.3075,0.0496,4.3107,0.9283,1.4689,5.5329,3.9931,2.9791,0.0016,2.7851,1.3753,8.0334,2.2357,3.9849,3.7378,3.4144,0.4048,0.5267,0.5206,8.4892,9.2392,9.7142,8.7629,0.315,3.3221,4.1813,6.5952,5.8837,4.9449,0.8901,4.8447,4.5034,2.1593,5.0513,2.2447,8.2394,4.0876,5.7793,2.1693,5.4261,1.3559,5.0737,2.9576,0.0331,3.9848,4.5368,0.5407,0.4949,5.7496,2.7797,5.3304,0.1431,5.9866,2.8317,9.9089,2.8645,2.8979,0.7248,5.5395,1.8508,3.3511,0.0415,5.8709,2.5279,0.0477,4.666,4.0005,0.0004,2.0019,6.34,2.9284,1.641,6.0493,2.9184,0.0545,8.2022,2.0618]}

Once in the south, they fled to the country retreat of the Comtois family, where Herg\u00e9 kept a copy of the comic book that he had been drawing for a year, for his children. The comic was published in serial format on the pages of the daily magazine Tintin from January 1941 onward and was collected into a single book in 1951. The title of the comic was later changed to \" Tintin in the Congo \", after the setting of the first part. The story begins when young Tintin and his dog Snowy try to find the mysterious Dr. Calculus' lost research in his laboratory on the Belgian royal family's African island retreat. Tintin discovers the secret island retreat of the King of Belgium, King Leopold and his personal adviser, Lord Marchal. Tintin and Snowy witness the murder of the royal advisor and find that he has been killed by a poison called \" Congo Red \". The plot then goes back and forth between Belgium and Africa and is divided into four segments\n\nHerg\u00e9 (1896-1957) drew Tintin in many different settings. During his earlier career, he drew cartoons for the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration, where he worked with various collaborators including Georges Remi, whose pseudonym Herg\u00e9 adopted. During World War I, he traveled around the Balkan and Middle East areas to sketch the trenches and battlefields. When the war ended, he traveled the United States to study American culture.

Frank L. Stoner, and had Stoner convert it from the original twin tail to a single-engine design in late 1943. With Stoner as the only pilot, he flew the aircraft to Europe in late 1944. The Navy provided a third crewmember for the mission, allowing Williams to send Stoner on leave.\n\nThe plane was delivered to Williams'company at Vero Beach, FL in August of 1944 and Stoner was sent back to the Netherlands East Indies for a leave. A series of mechanical problems caused Williams to fly the aircraft back to Florida in the winter of 1944-45.\n\nWilliams took delivery of a fourth aircraft in February of 1945 as part of the US Army's efforts to evaluate small aircraft for use as liaison, transport and observation aircraft in various locations overseas. To this end, he selected Lt. (jg) Edward T. O'Shea, a student at Naval Air Station Pensacola, to be both the aircraft's mechanic and a student.\n\nO'Shea arrived in Okinawa on April 7, 1945, and started his training in the Sea Devil. Three days later, American and Japanese troops began their initial attacks on the island.","token_len":381,"entropy":[2.6222,4.7182,4.0836,0.0769,0.3922,11.2746,7.0696,7.2076,8.8248,1.2067,7.8793,0.1205,5.8108,6.8638,4.8875,0.5894,5.6241,0.1788,3.3309,3.4741,10.1094,0.2163,0.028,4.0969,5.1582,2.6598,6.4788,3.6657,7.8309,8.9076,0.5126,1.8311,12.1785,15.7043,8.2992,5.81,7.8834,9.7005,0.2655,0.6687,3.3153,0.0035,0.0124,8.0892,4.6782,5.4556,4.9568,10.0796,2.3667,9.5446,2.7659,0.5533,0.9988,1.1386,1.496,3.077,9.7396,5.6795,1.5088,6.5584,3.1015,0.6222,2.861,3.8016,7.7442,2.2816,0.9852,2.2319,4.6306,0.2558,2.4879,7.0139,0.1748,1.2058,8.4132,3.6154,0.8053,5.2369,0.1689,1.2447,1.1706,2.0502,0.0036,2.5042,7.5381,0.0118,1.268,5.3722,1.9148,0.0245,2.2826,3.3282,1.5583,1.439,3.7873,7.0134,1.2982,4.4442,0.9199,4.8791,2.9312,3.6726,0.0147,2.2658,5.2151,0.0111,2.1337,2.6381,2.501,11.2573,3.6667,0.9505,8.6681,0.7413,0.4339,0.0118,2.0749,1.1619,11.7713,0.0041,1.1665,0.7167,1.264,0.0003,4.9001,6.091,0.8194,2.2516,2.7685,4.1368,0.0014,5.1844,1.0002,0.7131,4.8593,0.5398,7.0286,0.0044,4.5302,3.6265,0.1724,4.9677,4.3712,0.3022,3.1694,5.0803,5.1307,0.0002,7.3377,1.8351,4.2971,2.3531,3.2958,6.0627,5.4488,2.4657,0.639,2.5959,1.6599,0.8452,4.994,3.2613,4.1472,1.7275,0.3893,5.7143,2.1674,0.0002,5.2279,1.0282,4.1381,1.4978,1.0328,3.5955,3.3881,0.6874,1.6554,2.7918,5.4539,1.6543,2.6675,0.6039,1.1973,2.623,4.4173,6.0782,2.6184,5.0217,4.0321,2.709,2.1793,0.8264,4.5571,1.0871,6.1337,1.3992,0.2405,5.6482,4.2724,0.0001,2.674,7.8367,2.1296,0.5804,0.0001,1.9987,3.8011,1.0423,4.1444,0.5292,5.6528,2.3637,15.0136,2.9107,6.1766,4.085,0.0511,0.2882,3.8464,1.4316,3.6243,3.0399,1.2481,2.2149,5.3753,0.0001,1.526,3.1818,1.8386,0.1864,1.3534,5.7113,9.5993,0.4313,2.6087,2.2934,7.426,2.7459,4.3088,5.5765,0.0029,6.3059,0.8593,2.8114,2.8516,0.5358,3.9248,0.623,1.2705,3.0087,0.2051,3.5472,1.5926,3.406,4.1001,0.0629,1.8626,3.6365,0.0814,0.6715,0.9436,0.0002,2.5499,4.6783,5.7042,0.2353,3.6164,3.3401,1.9986,1.5683,3.0378,2.3703,0.1557,4.4257,1.8352,0.0007,1.0097,4.6781,2.4557,0.9147,6.7303,0.043,8.5322,8.3675,2.194,2.9309,1.8289,2.2049,8.1561,4.9206,5.0827,0.908,6.0654,1.2804,2.325,6.3354,3.3505,4.781,0.2075,6.2662,1.9918,0.1494,0.1328,1.873,5.1483,6.7702,0.0352,6.9454,8.0248,2.8314,0.2711,4.9884,3.2584,0.4144,5.074,0.4715,5.1685,0.0152,0.7849,1.4766,6.6114,1.5379,4.1889,0.8394,0.6364,2.7813,0.0009,0.0003,0.2733,5.3368,2.2728,8.551,1.4576,2.8287,0.448,5.7066,0.104,2.874,6.5116,2.3024,0.9099,0.0002,3.1037,0.0034,0.0067,0.0002,5.1874,0.5837,7.6155,1.4587,2.4824,3.3349,0.1261,0.2298,0.695,1.2246,5.5967,2.1318,2.6146,1.9593,1.5959,4.7656,1.026,2.3619,6.2559,0.4606,0.1657,0.3275,7.8004,3.2172,0.3492,2.8347,3.1838,3.1063,5.3252,3.9183,0.3175,0.7328,2.0123,0.7667]}

At that time, Austro Hungarian authorities wanted to disarm all the workers on the base. When the rioters resisted this, shots were fired by the Austro Hungarians.\n\nThe Austro Hungarians then proceeded to massacre the townspeople - men and women - who were gathered in the Belgrade area to protect the town.\n\nAustro Hungary was in no shape to stop the Yugoslav revolution and was in chaos. As a result, the ships in the base were abandoned.\n\nAfter the war they were looted by the Croats who wanted them or given to Yugoslavia which wanted to add them to its inventory. In 1968 Yugoslavia gave the four Italian vessels to the Republic of Venice. The others were given up to Albania, Montenegro and Bulgaria which added them to their navies.\n\nAt the end of 1974, the four Italian cruisers were bought by the Italian Navy. Two other vessels of the class were built, but this could not save the Italian cruiser class from abandonment. Since 1993, one has been held hostage at the Kolo\u010devo base ( the remaining three were sold off to various countries), by the Yugoslav Army. There, apparently, it will remain abandoned.\n\nToday, the four vessels rest off of the coast of Croatia.","token_len":381,"entropy":[2.3183,11.8208,1.7306,13.7329,8.5645,6.4056,9.3428,6.2183,6.5154,1.5422,1.9846,0.5771,1.4531,2.9879,4.1647,6.3131,0.4695,5.2341,1.6795,8.7691,3.5494,0.0793,1.1232,5.623,2.253,6.4963,0.6534,9.2436,3.6367,1.7021,10.3826,0.1925,0.9245,3.9344,0.0325,3.6222,11.6559,3.5681,0.9889,3.6231,1.6266,3.6953,1.1856,0.7941,3.9659,0.0539,5.7932,0.0107,2.3534,2.655,2.1883,4.1167,4.6125,0.8263,3.123,1.0208,6.6049,5.3058,2.2766,0.6704,3.9557,2.8301,1.6869,2.8579,6.9238,0.0027,2.9745,0.8421,1.3203,5.2105,0.7294,3.0244,2.2471,4.0039,2.9956,6.0637,0.0743,5.1354,4.2263,1.2477,1.8063,0.0853,4.3698,3.5484,3.03,0.7714,1.0631,0.2029,3.1124,7.3985,0.643,0.0023,2.6722,0.6242,4.7274,0.0737,7.547,2.7273,0.2784,1.4741,3.5992,7.9026,1.9704,5.1204,1.4473,1.1224,2.5521,4.4065,0.1287,3.5945,9.1121,7.3205,4.9569,0.7813,3.8252,4.1412,2.0087,2.571,8.7346,2.0782,8.9433,0.9947,3.6312,2.3715,0.3747,0.5533,5.0666,0.0652,2.8452,4.8915,4.5292,0.2811,7.3403,2.5049,1.4214,5.3922,3.0247,0.3834,0.6596,2.0239,4.1773,0.9603,2.1087,1.2991,5.8346,4.9613,0.77,9.4572,0.1159,0.0727,2.7746,1.7945,1.325,0.0147,1.7111,0.0138,1.3396,1.8421,0.0002,1.6953,1.2158,0.0186,1.1331,0.0241,3.1882,4.3566,0.045,4.5394,1.4756,6.9482,0.9054,0.0,6.2233,5.3192,1.7726,0.0782,2.8956,2.0688,1.3335,4.5212,1.8833,1.0027,9.3732,0.0193,3.4575,2.0773,4.8983,0.6306,4.6342,1.8268,1.7826,0.0002,4.2306,0.0263,2.7427,2.7179,3.7582,3.7421,4.3152,0.0862,4.3846,0.8409,6.64,5.4519,2.7148,3.4283,3.3342,7.7308,1.2933,3.968,1.6143,0.1489,0.4853,0.9916,9.8688,3.6791,0.499,5.3915,0.8136,4.1662,1.5227,1.4072,0.0003,3.1287,0.6944,2.0784,6.4552,1.4799,6.3009,1.7336,0.6217,4.5347,0.0065,2.6091,3.5584,3.7881,7.281,6.8226,0.8084,5.8169,5.8083,6.8646,0.9064,6.9931,1.8801,0.3833,2.352,8.41,0.5243,3.298,6.7454,4.9218,4.2279,1.5455,8.7449,5.6953,4.5592,1.2696,1.1452,4.7225,0.2553,5.5395,1.3408,2.102,6.5303,0.5408,3.2408,5.5928,1.6572,5.2114,1.9556,3.2686,0.0019,0.6272,3.082,3.1659,5.8956,1.0997,0.3513,1.281,8.4621,0.0598,0.5104,0.605,0.0003,4.4025,0.654,1.0411,0.0099,6.3587,1.0686,1.2101,5.868,0.8218,5.0674,0.0145,1.2493,5.5143,0.7356,0.6848,3.2299,2.1158,1.6536,5.1333,4.0376,3.4194,3.5899,0.4332,6.4591,1.3317,3.5082,3.4598,2.981,3.745,6.5249,0.2556,5.7705,0.7121,2.7481,4.2182,4.0768,1.8824,6.7846,0.6497,5.8964,6.8308,0.9125,5.0019,5.761,0.3274,7.6348,3.5988,3.3229,1.2561,5.381,2.0235,0.0088,0.0195,0.0044,1.0953,3.9143,4.2436,6.3252,2.4674,1.7936,2.3167,3.1743,0.9243,5.5066,3.0834,4.0047,5.1242,0.8165,3.2123,3.3499,1.2167,5.3844,2.5554,7.9406,0.7944,3.4619,4.3865,4.167,4.9642,1.5511,0.3745,0.0003,5.0755,0.6079,1.0074,4.2703,3.9753,8.9858,6.6202,2.2008,0.5216,3.1371,0.2308,2.0199,1.4096]}

On 15 April it entered the harbour of Dutch New Guinea.\n\nA small number of sailors and marines (from NIMM and the Marine Corps aboard ship) went ashore again at Lae on 17 July and at Kokoda in August.\n\nOn 22 September the ship left New Guinea and made two voyages to Japan.","token_len":381,"entropy":[8.6648,3.9434,4.0261,1.4061,7.7505,0.0272,8.5072,4.7579,5.4469,0.3818,5.977,4.2013,0.0176,2.7477,0.4947,1.2621,6.218,10.786,0.0003,0.0002,7.4659,8.8826,0.2677,1.0522,4.4942,12.2679,10.8373,4.4097,5.4326,6.0838,7.2959,6.3958,16.4462,6.9501,7.6077,10.0549,1.2995,0.9878,2.3034,5.2529,10.4393,0.1007,0.782,7.5563,3.8285,1.3498,0.9292,2.8415,7.1422,0.5387,2.6544,5.0927,0.5094,1.7103,2.867,3.3559,4.0517,4.0749,5.7097,3.6869,9.8763,1.6005,0.5807,3.5933,0.6132,1.0138,1.0677,0.0089,4.3958,2.696,1.2247,7.0413,4.9621,1.6159,4.3828,5.6513,5.3551,1.2592,0.3636,7.1323,3.0993,0.0008,2.9506,0.2466,4.7736,0.1025,3.2686,1.5847,5.5445,0.4508,1.2319,0.0065,3.8121,4.335,4.0124,2.3949,5.2102,1.3458,0.0524,3.255,2.4898,1.6487,0.9468,0.6944,3.1364,0.0318,4.1755,1.4513,4.9285,6.0599,3.6777,1.6416,3.4659,3.3827,2.7448,0.8325,0.628,3.4446,3.0096,3.6841,1.565,1.6117,0.0139,6.0326,0.405,5.9863,1.2422,0.285,1.5753,1.5987,5.6691,2.3364,2.6397,2.2063,5.0452,0.082,2.6986,7.4352,0.0899,4.4351,2.2454,6.8344,1.9098,4.4211,3.157,1.3265,5.1002,3.7716,3.5536,3.3586,0.497,8.3672,1.6974,5.671,2.1327,7.3819,4.493,1.465,0.51,0.0002,1.2581,2.1005,1.1595,5.1854,4.9249,3.64,6.5594,1.6123,7.4672,0.5635,5.2849,3.5896,6.3333,5.2058,0.0065,0.5822,5.4497,0.5967,1.4816,7.6443,1.3722,5.3958,5.4414,0.5746,2.1624,4.6443,1.7525,0.5022,4.8118,2.5088,0.9274,2.6404,3.0489,0.0924,0.7257,6.8465,3.9265,0.3413,0.0016,1.4203,2.9499,3.746,4.3944,3.0781,2.1487,0.0243,0.5778,1.5531,6.6925,0.4789,2.7999,4.1943,0.2709,1.5247,4.6403,4.3686,0.6493,3.6255,0.7422,6.3891,0.611,1.3164,0.181,0.0012,1.8049,6.3839,5.3625,0.3161,1.1916,3.1413,1.4011,4.3814,0.0419,0.9139,4.5483,4.8286,1.7562,0.2115,4.1704,4.476,6.5784,0.3979,2.2491,6.032,2.9046,7.7168,0.2253,0.139,1.8843,0.5191,0.9546,0.0001,1.0598,1.9769,5.9061,2.1995,0.0153,2.2622,1.4282,0.0022,4.5382,0.0039,1.5933,2.0924,4.0277,3.0839,2.6113,1.8049,2.3538,5.5538,1.7023,2.4095,8.2753,5.3649,2.5387,3.7087,2.6856,3.8132,2.956,3.4377,0.6624,2.1938,4.0588,12.3196,1.5429,2.9608,6.0953,4.267,4.156,3.1164,0.1113,0.0001,1.366,5.5215,5.3861,1.3548,1.5559,1.4156,6.4225,3.4528,0.0795,0.0157,1.8796,4.7091,0.1091,7.3228,5.3527,2.4233,2.9964,6.8124,5.261,7.531,1.1681,1.8886,3.3374,0.8649,1.823,4.3136,1.409,6.2304,0.3243,9.8104,3.1066,0.1244,1.5459,1.2786,0.0001,3.8362,4.6999,1.3965,0.0142,4.463,2.4603,1.6358,5.3842,5.0683,5.6962,6.6588,6.6863,1.9587,1.8694,4.5874,0.3994,9.1037,5.0345,0.3439,4.4195,0.645,6.5565,1.969,5.8254,7.6635,2.9803,2.819,5.126,2.2333,4.8361,7.0994,5.471,2.9913,3.9662,0.2812,1.9073,0.0002,1.9358,3.432,1.8722,1.2389,0.8797,3.6326,2.3367,1.7516,1.3295,3.3579,5.6667,2.8619,0.0023,0.857,5.2657,0.8717]}
{"id":539,"ended":true,"length":355,"text":"When the time came to begin You Only Live Twice, the producers were faced with the problem of a disenchanted star. Sean Connery had stated that he was tired of playing James Bond, and would rather do a new character. Ian Fleming wrote a new script around this, based on a retired spy, James Grant, a widower who had just gotten out of the service and who was \"more interested in being involved in local affairs,\" according to the notes in the script.\n\nThe script for \"You Only Live Twice,\" though, originally ended with Bond killing a man and escaping into a forest and escaping death. There was plenty of action, but Bond only won because Jaws got caught in an electric fence. Connery himself wanted to shoot Bond in the knees.\n\nThe producers agreed to all those demands, but only on one condition - that Connery be involved in every scene of shooting. He was also going to have to do more than just run and gun. Sean Connery and his personal trainer, Steve Peters, actually worked out a very specific routine. Connery would also have his name in the credits, with a special thanks for all the work he put in on the film.\n\nIn the real world, it\u2019s known as \u201cghosting,\u201d and is a major issue for anyone who wants to work hard to get somewhere. When you\u2019re going through the motions of doing the work, but you\u2019re not being recognized for it, it can lead to feelings of frustration and depression. When people do this to other people, it\u2019s usually because they\u2019re afraid or don\u2019t want to be found out.\n\nSean Connery wasn\u2019t actually trying to ghost, apparently. He was working more than 100 hours a day and was simply trying to take some time to himself.","token_len":381,"entropy":[2.5591,5.0692,2.0653,1.6108,4.842,12.3294,5.394,0.0607,0.1386,0.602,2.2857,4.3761,2.6736,5.4008,0.0114,1.3758,3.8273,0.1475,3.4126,8.0229,4.1628,0.0001,4.3335,1.7525,8.0632,2.34,0.0036,2.2293,7.6839,0.8458,0.7743,1.6269,4.1973,0.115,2.2446,5.2749,0.767,1.1524,0.8417,4.4787,1.6951,3.8758,2.0425,4.8017,4.0307,1.3412,8.0631,1.0436,5.9202,1.8339,3.705,1.7191,8.4633,2.1989,2.5575,5.2571,0.2158,2.2603,6.9915,2.8766,2.2256,3.4815,10.2524,1.4192,3.7151,7.8633,0.1677,1.2343,1.2384,3.627,4.734,2.1406,0.0899,2.3701,4.364,1.763,3.3711,1.905,6.1094,4.7822,2.658,0.1305,3.2713,4.4956,0.5118,7.2719,1.4318,4.1887,4.8107,0.0013,1.5643,6.4106,3.5415,0.873,3.5144,0.213,1.7422,0.0024,1.9237,2.8844,3.4309,2.7342,1.3344,0.01,0.0017,0.0012,2.8063,4.6624,0.3378,7.5213,6.4494,2.3133,2.8589,5.7071,2.6202,2.7969,2.1999,5.4778,3.1926,1.6396,3.8662,3.2174,4.3247,4.5096,0.9323,4.9136,0.9593,5.0286,0.1472,5.0175,1.4813,1.3776,3.9531,4.884,6.1776,2.9742,8.738,5.2045,4.4445,5.7921,1.7401,3.4295,5.5286,1.114,1.1265,4.8162,0.0284,5.6276,5.1081,0.3628,4.723,2.2631,1.7591,0.5939,7.0866,1.9792,1.5731,0.0002,2.109,3.4428,5.1373,0.6771,7.4148,4.4404,2.2544,0.8442,1.6594,4.3896,4.077,2.861,0.148,5.1575,1.0555,4.0052,0.0006,3.7261,5.2302,0.7653,4.5157,1.3787,2.6443,5.4295,0.6784,3.5778,1.5874,3.9189,3.634,0.0105,1.4184,0.1193,3.2719,4.1098,1.5108,0.7491,5.4242,3.7707,5.2157,1.1386,6.1877,0.1195,0.0005,3.78,2.4176,7.2548,3.7716,1.0134,4.6823,7.5071,0.243,6.5487,3.0965,2.9112,1.2389,5.3774,3.4462,6.8374,2.6047,2.3272,0.0031,1.1885,5.0143,1.2892,5.6726,6.127,3.4295,1.1409,1.0409,1.6773,3.4543,2.4856,3.7538,7.1648,2.9792,3.26,0.7455,2.7212,0.9404,1.21,1.2377,3.4927,0.9134,2.5418,0.3553,0.5692,0.0002,3.3184,1.3104,6.4271,0.3521,0.172,3.2455,19.1056,7.3237,1.0699,6.1973,0.8607,7.831,4.6615,10.562,0.5591,4.4132,4.7094,7.5319,1.8334,3.3902,1.7517,4.6121,4.5857,1.7224,4.8805,0.5372,2.526,0.0682,4.7685,5.3745,1.8299,1.6135,6.8145,0.655,3.8513,1.9421,9.6265,3.5283,1.6089,4.1553,1.9044,1.9505,0.8969,1.1121,3.487,2.8792,3.848,0.7877,6.0987,2.3452,2.4414,0.4228,0.942,1.4183,3.9329,4.8946,2.1031,0.2977,0.401,1.7228,1.9528,2.7995,0.0395,5.2835,0.0519,4.9792,1.0501,2.8843,0.4141,3.7194,3.184,4.2025,1.8988,1.516,4.0922,0.1835,0.3612,0.9023,1.6117,0.2329,0.0131,4.2527,2.4996,0.6742,4.0657,0.0955,3.3607,2.5658,3.7431,3.6746,0.123,0.3961,0.1324,1.0463,0.1575,1.7308,6.6776,0.5763,0.6463,0.9957,0.0002,6.3717,0.0255,0.0017,6.089,0.419,1.1535,0.0079,5.3175,4.1479,0.031,6.5843,2.6958,6.934,0.5779,1.2311,1.0894,3.2603,7.2545,2.4541,4.1588,0.219,0.4914,3.5776,2.8714,2.3526,6.3666,2.3662,0.0383,4.758,4.196,1.2475,1.7707,4.9009,0.7485]}

He did not see any African Americans in the graduating classes of Columbia University's School of American Public Health in 1921 and 1922, and he criticized the university's \"neglect of its Negro students\" because they could not receive scholarships while white students could. Despite this, two years later he was hired by Columbia as the school's first black teacher of economics, and he and his family moved to Manhattan. He later became a professor of sociology at Columbia University, resigning after a student was beaten in his classroom by a group of white men.\n\nDu Bois worked at the New York City Housing Authority from 1930 to 1954, serving both as director of the Housing Bureau and later as its general counsel.

Under Roosevelt and the New Deal, Du Bois pushed for job-creation measures, such as the Works Project Administration and President Roosevelt's Social Security Program.","token_len":381,"entropy":[2.9307,5.5011,0.0907,7.7901,0.6593,3.7539,3.2144,0.0031,1.0761,3.1869,1.316,0.1991,10.0104,2.919,0.0022,3.1816,8.4304,4.262,0.9793,9.8796,1.0645,7.8986,6.248,7.2128,6.0761,0.5296,6.7854,1.2675,6.7662,3.9636,3.4397,2.862,0.8088,2.2392,3.8612,1.8221,4.1063,1.1705,0.5648,2.403,0.0113,2.8548,0.2855,2.1472,0.0008,3.9763,5.5113,0.4853,0.4778,4.845,0.7272,1.7117,0.0068,0.0004,3.5595,2.2705,6.5353,0.1027,4.2817,0.0463,0.3899,3.198,1.7243,0.4451,0.9811,0.2219,0.8938,5.8111,0.8721,5.8753,0.9205,7.2428,2.6379,6.3916,1.6396,5.7229,0.0002,0.5485,0.8049,6.7945,0.5321,1.4851,5.0091,1.6748,4.9559,2.6932,6.126,0.4896,1.8306,0.8037,7.3668,2.6665,1.8958,6.378,0.4981,3.1261,2.8455,0.0291,5.7861,5.586,2.9253,3.1373,3.3989,2.3542,2.7582,0.9686,1.5402,1.8691,8.5143,1.0073,4.5655,0.8549,3.1052,6.6201,1.1426,1.5027,3.3711,2.769,1.7111,1.6999,4.135,1.4312,4.2982,0.1282,4.6902,4.4345,5.6999,5.0959,0.8744,2.8768,0.4966,5.671,1.7555,0.7508,7.0687,2.3341,0.6401,1.504,1.6419,3.9548,1.333,2.5277,2.0349,2.3349,4.1403,0.03,2.2388,1.5281,4.1322,4.4175,3.2602,1.8339,1.2996,1.1233,5.0038,0.6087,3.6269,2.1481,0.3374,5.6538,1.6855,2.705,3.3972,1.7146,1.2088,1.9237,0.7054,3.2112,0.6312,1.3889,1.9093,1.2612,10.9189,0.0018,3.0453,2.3967,3.0716,3.7812,4.102,2.9593,3.1671,1.9527,2.0154,0.7536,2.7041,0.0214,1.9261,2.7858,0.6066,0.5549,0.0002,2.0207,0.003,0.0009,4.9277,2.4591,1.1127,3.2446,0.4564,1.7828,4.8826,0.4779,3.3563,3.3568,0.5323,5.5658,0.7169,3.9748,6.3537,0.2534,3.6728,0.1337,0.8186,3.9436,2.9128,0.4714,5.2648,0.3596,3.0664,3.9296,1.1922,0.1948,3.1698,1.8559,0.2977,1.5637,1.7857,2.9257,1.5407,4.2454,0.6699,0.8075,5.8793,2.7233,9.1141,2.8237,2.4761,2.3433,3.5657,0.7922,1.929,4.2397,5.0828,6.1253,0.7837,0.0019,1.9467,0.2455,1.6458,6.7482,3.0555,1.7767,0.229,2.024,4.5472,8.6384,0.0002,6.1248,0.4315,0.7158,0.6791,0.2434,0.0017,0.0012,5.1055,2.7553,3.789,3.825,0.976,0.4649,4.3891,1.7212,0.0002,3.3202,3.8026,0.4626,6.5669,1.9437,1.9558,0.1205,0.7517,3.6005,0.2218,0.0554,0.0003,0.7904,1.662,0.5515,0.0104,0.0011,4.2109,0.4646,0.2011,3.5473,2.753,0.0086,6.3001,6.104,5.4487,2.8969,4.6469,7.4764,3.1349,5.2913,3.5885,0.0539,0.0024,6.0526,0.0961,5.4105,0.0621,1.0607,3.2898,3.851,2.7092,4.2025,3.4383,1.418,5.2041,3.028,2.6159,0.8067,2.1314,2.9988,2.7246,1.387,0.167,0.5775,2.5444,2.8039,3.7753,0.2988,3.4934,0.1547,5.197,1.6884,3.8311,10.6046,0.3636,1.114,0.6052,0.9249,6.1772,1.9784,2.2808,2.4478,0.4579,3.5455,3.8401,6.2981,2.0846,3.9588,2.8582,3.5406,0.1522,0.3329,0.9744,0.0016,0.0021,6.4866,0.9162,7.5583,2.7239,2.0585,3.2573,1.9746,2.2564,0.0019,1.5809,9.5441,8.2562,5.0315,2.2225,7.354,2.8614,0.3349,5.7542,0.0972,3.6902,1.6519]}
{"id":693,"ended":true,"length":361,"text":"Before the modern judicial review procedure superseded the petition of right as the remedy for challenging the validity of a prerogative power, the courts were traditionally only willing to state whether or not powers were within the prerogative powers of the Crown, without going much into the question of whether the Crown might exercise those powers. However, where the exercise of a prerogative power was in an area of policy which concerned a range of interests, this was regarded as outside the scope of judicial review. For example, it was accepted by the courts, in the early 20th century that the Crown's right to regulate and control trade and commerce was within its prerogative powers only as to those areas where it had an overall interest in trade and commerce. This was the basis on which the House of Lords held in the Rotherham Trading Corporation v Rotherham Municipal Corporation[1] :\n\n\"... although we may disapprove the exercise of the right to prohibit trade, we are not willing or able to determine whether that is in itself or under the circumstances that there may be any more than one possible sphere of power in which we can conceive of the right to regulate trade and commerce or such other matter of national policy as may come within the prerogative. All the rights which have been held to be inherent in the Crown are rights, within that area of policy where the Crown acts under delegated authority; their true nature and extent we are unable to say.\"\n\nIn other words, the exercise of a power such as to permit or prohibit trade and commerce was necessarily within the policy sphere of the power, and as such, to challenge the act was not at all within the scope of a petition of right.\n\nThere were certainly powers which the Crown claimed were of a policy nature, such as regulating the prices of bread and flour ; these were said to be within the Crown's legislative powers.","token_len":381,"entropy":[2.551,9.4209,10.1467,4.8769,6.295,10.4404,0.1983,0.6315,8.9563,1.9409,7.0445,4.8805,2.5612,4.4588,0.7564,7.0617,1.3608,2.6883,0.0694,1.5004,5.4952,2.678,0.0138,5.3707,0.6886,1.2523,4.016,2.4975,7.3217,5.5923,5.2079,0.0278,7.8463,3.867,2.8559,0.0031,8.9373,1.5007,5.0856,0.5897,5.1614,0.0007,0.0288,3.8919,1.3783,0.5671,4.6224,2.102,5.1706,4.9807,4.7998,2.991,0.7613,2.6794,0.2237,0.8198,1.4719,1.5447,3.6599,2.4897,2.4091,0.0681,0.8737,4.1353,0.0347,5.8266,1.0088,5.038,0.1414,1.8948,0.3526,0.0002,0.0006,0.9693,0.9743,3.5027,5.0875,2.3071,1.254,5.5684,3.4433,5.1318,1.7123,6.8337,0.0233,3.9139,0.7285,3.9665,1.4471,5.3464,0.2573,5.3433,0.1971,1.9176,0.0071,3.6806,0.1276,0.7153,3.9026,0.3444,0.0356,3.2017,0.7026,5.143,1.7872,0.6423,3.3409,4.0021,1.6757,1.5399,3.927,3.0502,0.0059,0.0714,6.9335,1.1585,1.7986,2.2833,3.0455,0.2755,3.4694,3.9189,1.8439,3.8518,2.0095,1.0399,1.0114,3.3523,1.8914,1.801,0.0003,0.0225,0.554,4.751,4.025,1.9135,4.2422,2.2949,2.0852,1.2215,1.9358,3.4145,6.7545,1.2139,0.6141,5.923,0.8966,0.0743,0.5725,2.5553,1.5731,3.7046,3.2367,2.7667,0.0006,0.767,6.6213,0.1939,0.7038,2.4269,1.105,2.7855,6.3805,4.7307,0.0353,9.5608,6.0478,2.3154,4.1711,0.3245,0.0021,6.1852,2.135,8.0084,2.5996,0.1265,5.9966,0.9464,0.0049,5.1589,6.4119,3.6141,2.1543,7.1076,2.8673,3.1299,0.0807,1.3927,3.1867,1.7997,5.4791,3.2744,1.8479,1.3883,2.6868,1.5108,4.7305,5.3617,0.3316,0.1016,5.7176,1.134,2.8377,2.9472,2.4968,3.84,4.1522,3.5566,0.7961,2.5103,4.0293,5.2622,3.2253,0.1858,3.3128,5.257,2.9516,1.7282,5.8412,7.841,0.3609,4.6032,1.9361,1.3342,3.9251,2.0312,6.5026,1.101,1.3646,2.4489,0.6561,0.9176,2.2917,1.0299,0.0614,5.1068,6.2395,0.4471,4.3316,2.9945,5.0623,2.1947,1.2073,1.0172,5.3897,1.2382,0.8712,2.5671,0.0037,0.0082,3.3899,5.3319,2.192,4.1025,2.082,3.4744,0.4533,3.5276,1.0607,0.4548,4.219,0.1576,0.4735,0.8353,1.9111,6.7818,3.8324,4.8037,3.819,5.6993,1.0146,0.752,4.2271,1.7236,0.7034,6.5663,3.6033,7.1396,1.5224,3.7036,5.2501,7.3599,1.7995,2.2526,2.6855,5.2823,2.3231,2.0659,0.1056,3.3417,2.3138,0.3301,0.0002,2.2826,2.9597,0.0658,0.0593,1.0873,4.8379,0.0237,0.9217,2.5471,5.7524,0.0345,2.4349,5.3452,1.8875,1.8874,1.0884,2.0266,0.1513,1.9048,7.3007,1.2464,0.2403,7.6369,4.5393,1.2272,0.7811,5.2073,2.1037,1.6281,4.2826,0.4149,1.4784,5.7182,6.8199,0.7742,8.6057,2.4079,1.9391,4.5774,0.9419,1.9699,0.2252,2.8758,0.0121,4.4713,5.5668,0.6302,0.1047,0.5507,1.206,0.0001,4.1598,1.9625,5.1586,6.3918,1.6089,1.7646,0.4098,6.3508,2.0605,4.9437,1.9859,3.7573,2.7409,1.4728,2.2458,0.0032,3.9801,1.8184,5.9797,0.2341,5.9572,0.9377,5.3876,9.5315,5.5556,0.9004,6.1107,0.062,0.5534,2.3645,0.1918,5.6294,0.0404,6.0218,0.9906,1.6551]}

On 19 May 2008, a lawsuit was filed in the United States Federal Court for the Central District of California by British film distributor, Toho Co., Ltd. against Columbia Pictures and Universal Images Group regarding the licensing of the film for release or home video in the United States. The complaint stated that the company (represented by the law firm Manatt, Phelps and Phillips) had previously licensed the film, but was informed in April 1997 by Columbia Pictures (represented by their counsel, Michael Schenk at Greenberg Glusker) that they terminated their distribution agreement with Columbia Pictures due to poor projected financial results and that Universal Studios had requested the termination. Later the same year, Universal Pictures had negotiated a new film license agreement that included Universal's request that a limited number of the films licensed be released theatrically and that the rest of the films would be exclusively released on DVD. They also stated that they would release at least one of the films theatrically.","token_len":381,"entropy":[7.1006,13.2688,6.1184,12.2544,10.3142,5.7127,5.6466,0.0469,0.3865,6.3427,1.9701,2.8203,4.9194,2.2697,4.6532,2.6566,3.7761,1.3905,0.7117,2.4385,2.2715,0.7611,0.9246,2.857,2.0462,7.6873,11.0157,2.9972,0.0008,3.3623,11.7047,13.7047,4.1811,0.3536,8.0397,6.2173,4.4322,1.8028,3.182,5.926,9.1602,0.4553,2.1243,0.4761,1.1486,4.2925,3.9053,2.1344,3.528,4.221,4.8907,1.005,3.4174,0.2089,1.3883,4.4923,1.2783,1.8117,0.2659,1.355,7.3652,1.0115,0.236,4.5724,5.3103,1.4149,1.8337,2.6701,5.5129,4.0545,1.8021,1.9842,1.0763,1.2288,0.6742,3.1785,4.0848,5.7361,1.8811,1.6447,6.1559,6.9717,2.3678,1.5157,6.142,0.2346,0.952,0.8997,0.9844,4.5599,1.9862,3.7501,1.3772,0.7264,4.0926,0.6398,3.8967,10.6462,6.9401,4.8946,0.0064,0.0037,0.0264,1.6156,0.0185,4.5197,4.8675,0.425,2.1342,6.1366,0.5396,3.9872,10.613,5.4507,8.1615,1.7811,1.6693,0.0002,4.4967,0.1581,1.5766,7.714,2.5632,0.0002,2.7343,0.4019,0.1293,0.1598,3.2209,0.0489,0.3738,1.422,0.0122,0.1232,0.0939,0.7486,0.0001,0.4225,0.0097,0.0239,2.6863,0.11,3.4789,0.4616,0.4851,0.0001,4.0082,6.6783,3.6681,3.3813,5.997,1.2337,2.8256,2.2076,4.9612,5.1352,3.9485,0.8391,0.8238,5.7641,4.3372,4.2698,3.1033,5.7795,3.0952,0.0582,0.7513,6.8635,0.7865,0.0003,6.125,3.7376,0.2319,0.8825,3.887,2.8244,0.8896,2.5136,1.7887,1.3371,4.9492,1.2676,1.0921,5.1165,1.3513,0.1363,5.8901,1.4671,4.0268,3.4793,2.9248,3.9102,0.4175,2.4988,5.2771,0.3525,0.5321,1.6375,0.9459,1.8466,0.6029,3.3973,0.3945,2.9268,0.1448,4.3789,0.0266,0.0208,1.1069,2.7246,7.284,2.7123,3.4601,3.016,5.089,3.0253,5.6849,0.7051,2.116,0.7346,3.0357,6.9324,0.4352,1.9365,3.0874,8.7817,5.5661,6.1228,0.6032,6.6489,0.3604,0.7691,2.7704,2.6052,4.7529,8.196,7.6841,0.6696,2.23,0.312,0.433,0.2893,0.6885,0.8392,2.847,2.3845,0.2506,1.5139,4.9179,5.039,8.8378,0.2184,2.4793,6.2587,0.0391,8.1221,5.146,2.6669,7.4848,1.6723,5.2392,0.4349,1.0002,5.1958,2.5641,0.6832,0.8654,3.7869,1.5416,2.8699,6.1026,2.836,3.8409,4.8202,1.7006,1.7937,0.8318,4.5398,2.9993,0.0111,5.9431,4.1016,1.7755,5.6068,6.8301,1.4269,0.792,5.4185,6.7417,6.9454,4.5995,5.0518,0.8391,0.1074,2.1696,10.3154,1.3735,4.4514,1.1637,0.4112,0.8677,0.6032,4.4455,0.0097,5.0405,11.791,6.5003,1.1803,1.8038,2.6815,3.6217,4.7075,1.732,5.1978,1.9485,7.0498,1.6986,6.636,3.9545,2.7175,1.3627,0.4403,2.658,1.9483,4.8393,5.6466,0.6329,2.186,5.8536,3.2982,0.8042,3.5525,1.7365,3.9679,1.3632,6.0249,2.2056,3.7548,5.553,0.8109,0.0082,2.3879,1.0528,6.5962,2.742,1.2304,6.4647,0.0065,0.0001,2.8596,3.4239,1.5044,6.2178,2.1042,0.1509,0.8853,2.8887,0.4261,6.0454,2.4707,1.0601,0.9979,1.1072,6.0394,1.9366,3.2785,0.1945,1.4594,1.2502,3.4207,5.0435,0.1569,1.2532,1.8932,0.7623,0.7909,6.65,0.0012,0.0014,2.2297]}
{"id":2512,"ended":true,"length":287,"text":"After the Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu event, K\u012blauea remained relatively quiet, and, for a time, completely silent, with all activity confined to the summit. It came alive again in 1952 with an explosive collapse of the summit cone between July 25 and 27. During that explosive eruption, lava spatter descended about 3,600' (1,100 m) along the west margin of Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu ( figure 14-8 ). On the day of the greatest explosive event, the lava spatter fell through the rift zone and erupted from fissures in Leilani and Pu'u o'Owens. The lava flow traveled about 6,700' (2,110 m) before entering Kaupili Pali. This was the largest lava flow in the Leilani Estates area to enter the ocean. The K\u012blauea lava flow traveled about 3.5 mi (5.7 km) in 19 h ( figure 14-8 ). A total of 3.4 mi (5.7 km) of lava flowed southward from the eruption. The lava flow consisted of mostly glass lava with a smattering of small blocks, pebbles, and volcanic debris. The fissures caused fissure earthquakes, small earthquakes, and explosions. On August 3, 1955, lava flow from Leilani reached Waiohinu and extended about 2,600' (743 m) southeastward into the interior of Kaupili Pali. In 1957, another series of small explosive flows traveled from Leilani. During December of the same year, lava flowed from Leilani at Pu'u \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d and lava flowed from Leilani in early 1958 ; by the end of the month, lava flow from both fissures reached Kaupili Pali.","token_len":381,"entropy":[2.3183,10.6447,6.3992,11.1709,0.2203,8.1324,5.1316,0.0146,3.6591,7.5932,0.7889,5.9994,5.162,2.8907,8.8493,2.7446,6.6073,4.6192,1.1441,1.8459,2.5523,5.6799,3.6756,1.978,1.3073,0.1139,9.4479,2.9887,2.6342,3.5866,5.4926,6.5243,4.1601,0.0815,0.9039,7.3979,1.1985,3.9802,6.2075,9.6482,1.9269,1.4848,7.6811,2.6228,2.7344,6.3056,6.4345,0.8855,0.6684,3.834,7.9347,6.5867,7.063,4.0589,0.309,4.8225,1.5777,4.3859,1.9024,8.7905,4.256,0.243,3.8179,6.0801,3.6994,7.3729,5.7146,3.5813,1.1119,3.568,6.0697,1.8598,1.8182,0.0321,3.6575,0.8199,0.2467,5.7003,0.3885,4.9646,5.7726,0.1661,6.7622,0.0041,0.0203,0.0007,0.0253,0.0961,0.002,0.0143,4.0268,11.1584,5.0319,4.2443,4.1736,0.4792,4.1012,1.6121,4.6882,0.5975,0.3268,8.838,6.6419,2.8939,1.5102,1.7666,2.0179,1.1662,0.0135,2.9253,5.6222,0.9392,7.3282,5.6971,2.1421,4.6376,3.6789,9.6784,0.4745,0.2292,1.4859,10.8367,4.9255,1.7736,2.9297,6.2941,2.2708,1.1519,8.2354,1.8875,5.8283,3.7609,5.5941,1.8507,1.271,1.7081,5.1241,5.8613,3.0785,3.5535,0.5205,3.2974,0.1669,0.0428,1.8397,0.0085,6.2868,0.0369,0.0525,3.7422,4.6612,9.6784,4.4998,7.3285,10.8256,2.5112,2.4198,3.3797,3.0387,0.9593,1.3105,1.4299,1.6672,2.0633,0.6669,6.2242,0.0238,0.0049,9.4619,3.8224,4.2141,4.6394,6.9387,0.982,4.7318,1.9194,1.456,4.6007,0.4294,0.0131,0.019,0.0069,2.206,1.1672,4.4545,1.191,2.2907,3.1846,0.9263,4.2657,0.0568,3.553,0.4765,2.4709,0.1404,0.0605,2.9922,8.1431,6.0589,0.328,2.6205,0.76,0.1549,2.4349,0.1701,4.1149,3.4037,0.0902,3.6441,1.6112,2.5154,0.733,0.0612,1.2745,0.0296,1.3776,0.0091,0.0076,0.6942,0.6572,1.2572,5.3089,1.0046,1.6792,1.1035,4.8253,2.1774,1.2189,1.2637,1.0576,6.6322,0.1846,6.2004,6.3308,3.2114,2.8513,1.4907,7.3641,1.4926,0.0104,4.6681,5.9078,2.7028,6.9293,0.0822,0.0258,0.4559,0.6817,4.793,2.3188,0.5333,1.0948,6.3559,0.0781,0.2004,4.229,6.1787,0.0888,2.8288,9.1446,1.8812,6.3388,1.6031,0.5925,0.2501,4.3599,0.9247,4.1356,2.8658,3.1247,0.2122,4.3178,0.1227,2.0323,2.8803,3.1332,3.3033,0.0096,0.0029,4.2089,7.3383,7.2115,11.2961,3.4916,2.4535,6.4933,3.7199,2.0593,1.5305,2.8612,0.1832,0.0179,5.4495,5.5101,0.0848,0.0709,4.4559,1.2414,2.8175,0.9138,6.0588,0.2168,1.4453,0.0518,0.0213,0.2368,0.0008,0.6505,3.316,3.7025,0.2566,5.5949,6.5385,0.0078,3.8965,5.9531,4.8963,4.4505,2.849,1.7262,0.0058,0.0018,5.081,3.7604,8.684,3.2331,3.2481,0.0903,0.0118,0.1114,1.0139,2.7025,1.5946,1.5416,0.0075,0.0019,4.4474,5.27,0.0996,0.0316,6.9983,0.0586,0.0053,6.3092,1.0826,3.7094,0.2238,4.7037,2.0524,7.621,1.6417,0.5764,2.2338,0.0227,0.004,2.7405,5.8247,2.0012,10.0407,5.1187,1.4965,0.6481,0.0086,1.2256,3.8784,1.1238,0.8924,0.9734,0.6598,5.7184,6.3054,0.0455,0.0075,1.9777,2.0872,0.0228,0.0084,0.2709,0.0009,0.5829]}

The cornerstone was laid and construction begun in May ; the church was completed by the end of the year [28].\n\nConstruction of the first chapel (1908\u20131911)\n\nThe parish, which included a small chapel, had been formed out of the villages of St. Catherine\u2019s (later St. James\u2019; see above), Nelsteg (later St. Peter\u2019s, now the cemetery), and Old Middens (later St. Joseph\u2019s; now part of the parish of St. Luke\u2019s).\n\nThe Romanesque Revival church built on the existing ground had two naves and was a typical country rectory church. It was first described as being one room above another; its nave was enclosed with semi-recessive walls and the vestry on the south side faced in brick. The roof was timber framed with a tiled ridge; a clerestory and a small oriel window adorned the chancel. A stone bellcote was located at the front, with a stone cross on the front. The porch, with its entrance and a small staircase, was located at the western end; a window on the first floor, behind the entrance, was in the original shape.\n\nThe church was originally intended to be a mission, although this was abandoned; it was used as the church for the village until the small \u201cmission church\u201d, designed for only nine people, was completed. Since the existing church had no accommodation for the priest or Sunday School children, the priest was obliged to live near the church in a house owned by the church, and the church was used for Sunday School only on weekdays ; it was too small for the many children who regularly attended.","token_len":381,"entropy":[11.7086,0.2993,2.9807,10.9785,2.7348,0.0048,9.0727,4.8685,7.3651,0.2502,6.6906,6.3561,2.7426,6.0505,1.638,1.2643,1.7125,0.8521,7.9732,7.5675,3.0182,1.4877,6.9601,0.8488,3.4315,4.2097,6.8424,5.3742,0.9091,4.8297,12.8747,1.3337,1.922,0.8145,1.7486,2.4879,2.153,1.1565,0.0055,1.9888,0.8276,8.045,5.4238,1.4508,1.9603,0.0102,4.4564,1.5157,0.3465,3.8873,5.3612,4.0037,2.7566,3.7673,3.7404,1.6497,1.7359,0.0825,1.2995,0.0003,1.3194,7.5755,4.7611,1.9919,3.5772,1.8295,3.3442,1.7825,1.2668,3.8737,2.0317,6.0162,4.6328,0.0068,1.4846,8.4994,0.3479,4.8454,0.5844,5.0866,13.1717,7.1802,4.4528,3.4859,4.6622,1.4944,0.0535,4.8989,3.0282,0.3608,7.3809,5.4327,3.393,1.2326,5.5907,7.1641,6.0786,7.0048,2.7131,2.6383,0.856,0.0246,2.8114,1.2648,0.0762,2.7505,2.4479,2.5268,3.5727,8.2742,1.775,0.7103,6.6887,5.2176,4.7259,3.5844,0.9228,1.4281,1.0531,0.0129,4.0199,1.0794,0.0198,0.228,3.3198,3.3328,6.9004,0.0037,0.7797,3.1349,2.4373,1.8372,0.0435,4.8712,0.7708,0.006,0.3801,0.9998,2.4261,0.0002,1.0796,8.2848,0.0158,0.0209,0.1536,0.5266,3.7886,1.7629,0.5407,4.0015,3.609,3.8174,3.4173,7.8203,3.0504,1.9645,2.7234,3.7548,5.4643,8.7982,9.0417,0.0417,3.7803,0.9557,2.0209,0.8427,5.4111,4.2329,1.6808,2.0714,4.4588,7.1566,4.3086,6.3306,4.2929,3.513,4.3286,0.7436,0.7669,5.4282,1.9937,8.4416,0.0311,8.5979,8.9596,2.95,1.6249,3.1115,8.7823,2.3176,5.2956,0.9785,3.9959,0.8282,7.4317,4.0769,8.0952,1.1541,1.1614,3.8717,0.8291,7.9274,2.8643,1.6988,2.2482,5.8097,1.811,7.7721,4.0139,3.013,8.4496,3.7538,0.0969,4.1283,1.9288,3.8369,7.7057,5.3436,5.3491,6.8259,0.3735,12.6733,1.0443,1.561,2.8033,4.8245,6.0888,6.7789,2.4138,1.0762,3.889,1.8616,0.1871,3.1213,2.5383,2.8088,0.8759,4.3943,3.1478,1.9253,0.67,3.6827,1.1601,1.0283,6.7129,3.0935,2.0865,1.14,6.9521,2.3288,2.922,2.6593,4.6697,0.9033,0.54,3.9898,1.9331,0.0475,7.5405,0.337,4.1583,1.8971,5.1651,3.1178,0.2608,5.5202,0.4065,2.5422,5.6385,1.041,4.0569,0.4884,0.724,3.3639,0.7167,6.4307,2.5835,1.9099,1.6445,0.0002,0.8783,1.594,0.7439,4.0885,3.016,0.4808,0.4277,1.2486,8.847,3.8156,5.22,3.1691,0.9633,3.6548,6.0248,2.0204,0.4899,4.6541,1.1063,2.8442,2.965,3.253,1.6969,7.8485,7.1515,1.3101,7.916,14.6431,5.6902,5.2272,3.3454,4.4418,6.2504,3.4685,4.7857,2.9813,5.5222,5.4021,1.9598,0.7869,0.2726,2.5801,1.617,5.5061,1.0492,7.5727,1.2376,1.7262,2.0828,8.0757,1.3751,1.5408,6.5799,2.263,6.7143,1.7127,3.2916,0.2936,0.9823,4.6286,1.5743,3.8188,0.0233,3.5221,5.2502,0.2848,1.2779,3.1327,1.997,3.4029,6.1198,0.0684,0.6709,2.4556,2.3129,1.5236,1.2559,2.5113,0.9852,3.3446,1.631,3.187,0.8374,5.5939,4.7698,7.1141,0.0807,6.6968,3.0202,0.4145,7.2769,1.4121,1.0839,1.011,6.07,1.6288,1.1951,6.4011,0.7027,2.1559]}

The top and bottom of the pile, as well as the names of the country or countries, is then read aloud. The national anthem of the sponsoring country is also played. Then, each person who finished first, second or third receives their medal one at a time and salutes the flag of the country who sponsored the event before being escorted away by a member of the military. Since the Paralympic Games are non-commercial, the national symbols of the sponsoring country are used.

Jamal claimed the driver, a male named \"Maksoor,\" stepped out of the car, pulled out a gun, and fired at Faulkner. Jamal said he ran up to the passenger side of the car, opened the door, and threw Faulkner to the ground. Jamal said he had Faulkner's gun but had fired in self-defense.\n\nJamal says as he was running away, he saw Maksoor take Faulkner's gun. Jamal says Maksoor then tossed the gun out of the cab window & drove off in the car ( FLL-1170, below ).\n\nAs Jamal was going to the hospital, a police officer asked him if he had seen a white car. Jamal told the cop that he had seen a white car and that it had fled.

{"id":352,"ended":true,"length":334,"text":"The Crab with the Golden Claws began serialisation in Le Soir Jeunesse on 17 October 1940. However, on 8 May 1941, a paper shortage caused by the ongoing war led to the strip being pulled by the newspaper. The first four stories of the series were then released in magazine Le Poteau, from 1 December 1941 through 23 January 1947. The fifth, and final, serialisation of the story ran in Le Poteau from 12 May 1946 through 23 June 1947.\n\nThe story is set in fictional French colony Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy in the middle of the 1930s, and concerns Jean-Pierre Pertuis, a petty crook who finds himself transported to the moon by the mysterious Dr. Nansen who had employed him as a bodyguard for his ship. There, he becomes involved in a battle to save his crew and himself as a meteorite crashes into their ship. Jean-Pierre comes to have a fondness for his captor, the doctor, and is reluctant to leave him, both for his own sake and due to his growing feelings for the doctor's daughter, Claire.\n\nThe comic strip had been a major hit for Le Soir Jeunesse, but due to financial and political pressures the magazine was forced to drop support for the strip in 1941. The magazine, however, continued to publish the series in its magazine supplements over the following years, but the last story ran in the newspaper at the time of cancellation. It was only when publisher Risso was allowed to set up Le Petit Journal for his daughter, which ran from 1947 until 1993, that the series was eventually collected and published in book form.\n\nThe strip's popularity revived when it ran again between 1991 and 1992 in a series of comics adaptations in the newspaper L'Express. The strip also inspired a number of tie-in novels.","token_len":381,"entropy":[12.4471,6.1487,1.5443,5.6119,5.2665,0.3797,9.294,9.4774,5.1701,0.7934,9.2081,10.1945,0.3994,9.9916,1.4258,0.0087,2.1607,4.0428,2.4538,5.0214,0.7969,6.3021,0.1935,4.5356,3.9138,3.4051,1.3551,0.7929,2.6539,6.1231,11.3451,2.3194,3.007,1.0755,7.1657,0.9774,3.2832,0.3938,0.853,9.373,1.6554,4.9639,4.0491,1.5055,6.4788,1.9928,1.5853,3.8995,5.8565,4.1386,1.7469,0.3569,3.0514,0.5508,4.9832,3.722,1.5866,7.3883,6.1576,5.1012,7.0265,4.4467,2.0581,5.6814,3.9984,2.9318,0.5373,2.7296,3.5502,1.7336,6.1882,0.2808,1.4953,4.4303,2.7334,4.1238,0.5762,0.6658,5.1241,0.8083,1.3309,0.4945,3.3834,4.6118,1.812,0.9855,2.4018,0.0334,0.0055,2.6156,3.71,2.1453,2.4326,1.3922,2.2972,2.3562,0.7592,0.3131,1.3046,0.0139,1.4936,3.4716,3.2272,3.6323,0.4105,9.1608,4.236,3.7801,6.2353,0.491,6.3769,0.5186,0.5427,0.3766,0.1432,2.6127,0.8051,4.6793,0.0899,0.4891,5.5068,0.0678,1.2525,1.9063,6.7553,5.0418,0.8995,2.6331,5.2311,5.9798,6.2508,1.5839,0.4811,0.7615,5.9684,6.9988,0.0238,0.8234,4.3077,0.3688,6.0511,0.621,1.3215,6.4756,1.4162,1.9182,4.3075,4.4508,0.7927,5.4068,6.4786,3.7287,4.3152,8.6154,0.8048,1.166,0.4046,5.367,0.0658,2.2725,2.4444,5.8169,0.9679,5.5093,0.6798,0.8935,4.4704,2.3985,0.498,0.6398,3.9318,3.8217,1.2276,1.6828,3.3909,2.0681,5.4367,3.6543,2.5741,7.3203,0.6282,3.5559,0.5831,3.1824,1.4098,0.6739,4.2028,0.1392,0.0906,6.5276,1.0854,5.5986,0.9919,8.0778,0.1432,0.027,2.937,7.0326,1.1669,0.8534,3.2177,4.5029,0.9461,0.8763,3.0948,5.0568,0.0369,3.3063,1.073,2.1928,6.983,2.1746,1.1116,0.7321,2.4679,0.0554,5.6634,0.0073,0.8701,4.9731,3.0854,0.2413,1.5464,2.0954,2.628,3.599,1.2871,5.6704,0.6259,1.6932,0.0001,1.434,4.6656,2.6789,4.7781,2.4965,4.0155,3.4852,2.1201,3.1109,2.2468,5.0142,0.0092,0.1256,0.002,0.0004,1.1388,3.7375,4.7375,0.0108,5.2548,4.1792,2.0801,2.8098,2.9863,4.4477,1.4827,1.2377,0.0372,4.6359,8.5697,1.2332,0.4489,1.4534,2.0316,4.6798,0.5307,1.6682,4.2334,3.8029,1.7065,0.0103,1.198,0.3338,0.951,1.0682,2.8156,2.4653,2.549,3.8466,11.2595,6.2239,0.1709,1.546,0.7312,0.9742,3.5736,2.155,4.9324,3.4199,4.9227,0.6917,2.3131,5.0951,5.9661,0.6519,4.6622,1.3021,7.7464,0.757,3.3278,0.6483,3.9155,2.9739,6.4463,5.6123,5.7955,4.0265,3.9233,5.8935,0.1724,6.9424,0.2333,5.2867,5.9101,0.2349,5.2037,3.6864,4.1956,5.3385,1.7429,3.4931,2.9034,2.5397,5.1679,1.7246,5.746,0.1081,0.1421,0.6501,2.5411,0.6534,5.7855,6.4676,1.8216,0.7127,1.7795,5.7251,0.1207,0.3688,0.5772,0.0001,1.6966,3.4391,2.3898,3.1064,6.3536,3.0107,1.7166,3.3113,4.5176,6.124,5.0696,0.0798,3.3299,3.1013,2.969,2.2327,0.756,4.424,6.5272,3.9889,1.8781,5.8623,5.0202,0.2367,2.9567,1.3655,1.4541,3.8705,3.1256,5.8547,1.2466,2.427,0.0038,7.7174,0.0374,0.746,3.1373,2.7179]}

He was owned by Mrs. W. F. Lechmere, of 468 Park Avenue, Waverly, Rensselaer County, and was trained by Mr. William E. Smith, of 12th Street, Waverly, New York.\n\nWaxy raced thirteen times between January 6, 1901, and September 26, 1903, accumulating a total of five wins and four seconds. That last performance, in the two - mile race at Central Park on September 26, 1903, brought him good money, for he came in second behind Mr. John C.

{"id":1387,"ended":true,"length":353,"text":"In 1863, ground was broke near Miller's Landing on the Missouri River for the First Transcontinental Railroad. Along with local financier Edward Creighton, George Francis Train was the promoter who was trying to raise money for the new railroad. Although Train was a leading businessman who knew how to secure financing, his business ventures didn 't always turn a profit. In fact, the first business that Train built did not have a roof on top. It was called the Plank Road and Train named the street after a popular board game. The board game was named after the Plank Road and Train thought that if he named the new street Plank Road, he would gain some attention. The problem was that the board game was actually named Plank Road. George had to change the name. Once the name was changed to Pacific Street, people really began paying attention to his ideas and money began to pour into the town.\n\nIn 1864 the town was incorporated under the name Pacific and was named after the railroad and because of the plank roads. George Train served as the first mayor of Pacific in 1864. He chose an interesting person to be the first mayor. His name was Hiram A. Plunkett. Hiram became mayor at a time when there was a lot of tension. President Abraham Lincoln had just been assassinated. The Confederates had taken control of Washington DC and Lincoln's killer John Wilkes Booth was living in nearby Maryland. On the Pacific Town Council, one of the first items discussed was whether to go on strike. Some soldiers from nearby Fort Kearney were going to be in Pacific to help keep order. The council members voted that they would go on strike and the Confederates didn 't want that happening in their town.\n\nThe Pacific Town Council, led by Mayor Plunkett, made such a nuisance of themselves that the Confederates simply left the town.","token_len":381,"entropy":[12.1162,0.3122,11.403,3.1751,7.3564,4.852,8.1402,1.2915,4.8046,2.7191,0.9321,3.3898,0.331,4.58,0.9966,5.3451,5.6858,0.6398,0.1111,0.581,6.6736,0.4825,6.3495,11.1491,0.1012,0.0097,4.451,9.7103,1.1086,0.2986,6.6519,7.8504,10.7449,2.6443,2.4615,7.6131,3.6731,3.616,5.0159,0.0205,3.457,0.7723,0.4656,0.6181,4.4,0.9589,0.3993,5.7021,4.0465,1.3613,2.3971,5.8346,3.8293,3.9411,4.8315,2.8324,0.1177,6.6693,2.1847,1.2895,2.4843,3.2587,5.4195,4.2375,12.4239,1.3201,3.4009,4.1604,5.7566,0.0304,0.3885,1.938,3.2233,0.142,2.7603,2.8788,5.6664,2.7907,3.6322,3.6016,5.2761,0.8568,3.6456,1.4277,7.0891,3.2065,3.452,1.787,2.3477,0.6823,4.0504,1.1453,7.2978,1.5962,3.8323,3.2609,5.3758,6.7156,2.5613,6.4638,0.4123,3.1226,4.7889,7.7396,0.2639,1.3644,2.0125,5.4614,0.3994,1.1279,3.924,0.6027,1.3481,3.4602,0.0349,1.3832,2.6989,0.8757,10.0154,2.0943,3.6494,3.3597,6.8767,1.2409,4.6826,2.2026,5.7707,0.0197,0.0965,1.9319,1.2173,0.4793,4.1469,3.2975,4.3963,1.1504,2.0583,6.3334,0.5494,0.4894,1.215,2.9593,0.2601,1.0488,4.4167,2.9162,4.1592,0.0155,0.0867,2.1769,5.3939,5.1323,2.8423,4.83,0.4532,0.2329,3.9169,5.7834,1.2756,1.2527,0.693,0.1199,2.0725,9.3607,4.1933,0.643,6.2605,6.6424,2.633,6.0276,0.0698,0.7809,3.7115,4.7189,1.8358,4.4632,4.0201,1.3063,2.4473,1.6155,0.8729,5.1818,0.3214,2.2629,0.0764,2.5832,1.0897,1.5009,3.2125,2.5189,1.8221,4.8931,3.8733,0.3109,0.4966,1.6775,4.3997,3.2911,2.2577,0.7871,0.8639,4.26,3.9837,7.9782,0.522,1.5515,10.4638,3.0692,2.6083,3.3125,3.2219,8.1108,0.7394,0.8887,3.3099,4.8918,0.7575,3.4328,4.2722,0.8121,1.2356,0.4716,1.5265,6.9307,5.1344,3.7909,4.6511,1.0508,1.8805,1.5841,1.6703,0.9497,2.0539,3.8146,1.4786,0.3493,7.7077,0.0638,5.6993,0.2018,5.4838,5.2302,0.0304,1.1972,4.5401,0.0017,4.969,1.6795,4.0317,3.0604,0.4803,0.0891,3.315,0.7009,1.0306,2.1845,0.1663,4.0505,3.7178,5.3357,3.1563,0.0445,1.8568,3.2336,1.8403,2.9555,1.8603,2.3065,8.2577,0.009,1.157,2.8911,2.7915,0.0655,3.9958,3.3611,0.716,4.629,3.1735,9.7842,4.2554,2.4492,0.018,0.0078,0.7405,5.4148,0.5842,5.9247,4.1986,0.226,4.7653,1.7679,8.0759,8.0274,1.3171,1.4822,5.1837,0.8681,0.2576,2.781,6.1555,4.1894,0.2793,2.2455,1.5062,4.0415,3.6087,2.8977,0.6782,5.3238,8.0177,3.7164,5.769,4.6007,8.9316,0.3121,1.6648,3.8029,0.3537,2.997,3.5075,7.9158,2.1525,2.5273,5.2044,5.2419,0.6085,2.0572,3.4877,4.1157,2.5702,3.5904,1.2413,0.8328,1.6214,0.5683,0.0178,1.5854,2.5023,8.0421,0.0082,5.1117,5.4851,0.0443,0.9419,2.9486,3.3527,3.6868,1.8887,1.8261,0.7452,2.0545,0.0002,1.8446,4.358,0.6011,0.0474,4.3056,3.8779,0.0093,4.685,1.4424,0.0563,0.0035,0.2979,4.1324,7.1216,0.4087,10.0265,0.9963,2.3275,0.2903,2.0994,4.3306,0.0106,6.0813,4.0314,0.981,0.6011,0.8297]}
{"id":2992,"ended":true,"length":338,"text":"Domitian was assassinated on 18 September 96, in a palace conspiracy organized by court officials. A highly detailed account of the plot and the assassination is provided by Suetonius, who alleges that the plot was designed to install Quintilian as Roman Emperor. According to Suetonius, Domitian was murdered as a result of a coup that was planned in the summer of 96.\n\nIn spite of the widespread belief that Quintilian was implicated in the plot (indeed we often see scholars argue that the name Quintilian itself somehow implies that the emperor would make a very good emperor and emperor for a good and just regime), Suetonius does not attribute the plot to him. Instead he asserts that the plot was the culmination of rumors that Domitian had secretly married and was planning to commit incest. Suetonius states that the conspirators were in fact only a small group \u2014 about 200 in all \u2014 but a \"group of 200 senators\" was more than enough to bring Nero down. He asserts that Domitian was assassinated because both Domitian and the conspirators feared that Suetonius would expose the plot. As Suetonius recounts:\n\nQuintilian having heard of the secret negotiations and the marriage in the palace and fearing that the Senate, as well as the Roman people, would learn the truth, consented to kill the former emperor. He was instructed to make use of the name of Titus Quinctius, although this was another name that was known as being of the house of Titus; and so many senators, who had been promised for many of the offices, would immediately turn against Domitian on seeing the Senate so divided (Gk)\n\nSuetonius does not provide us with the names of the conspirators, and we have no way of verifying that this was actually what happened, but it is certainly a credible version of the story.","token_len":382,"entropy":[5.8384,5.0591,4.6181,6.4044,2.5029,5.0131,2.8303,11.2997,1.4308,3.5048,2.2529,5.4892,7.2788,6.1543,0.1497,10.4533,2.1686,1.3582,4.0644,7.211,4.964,1.9946,0.357,0.677,2.9522,3.5103,1.2257,3.6116,1.7782,3.3742,1.9387,7.4295,3.9886,0.0328,1.3708,1.3635,7.7074,0.2339,1.5384,4.3735,0.9985,5.4474,0.2725,7.3666,10.316,1.7791,0.8739,5.4619,1.8052,1.098,4.5198,0.0008,0.4529,0.0002,0.0006,0.2335,8.9073,0.0052,0.0044,1.7328,3.6861,3.3289,0.8068,0.5988,0.0208,1.4836,4.2578,3.9951,1.9968,3.502,2.7303,1.862,4.1341,0.092,0.966,1.0009,1.3418,0.0019,2.6319,5.646,0.0047,0.9084,4.8203,3.5092,0.4931,3.495,0.0709,0.6139,6.6144,0.3953,0.3314,1.5154,4.7973,7.1147,0.1208,7.3529,5.2277,1.8832,6.8481,4.2204,0.2539,1.717,6.2156,2.9577,0.1614,5.1455,7.6923,3.1408,0.9269,1.809,3.4748,4.7844,6.2588,1.0171,5.7876,1.9063,2.0237,3.7881,7.2587,4.5941,2.2097,4.3689,5.9109,4.1132,5.4633,0.4383,4.3906,0.0002,0.0014,2.8061,0.3233,5.215,0.8779,2.4281,0.3151,2.8146,0.6527,1.9032,2.4667,3.3676,0.1078,1.3295,1.5948,0.562,4.225,4.4289,0.0179,7.3862,1.895,3.971,0.0019,0.0037,1.0939,3.6077,7.83,3.6441,3.2259,4.0027,0.4185,5.3973,5.3684,1.2121,4.0235,0.0003,0.0011,3.4413,0.3304,1.5675,2.7719,0.1061,1.8484,4.517,1.0523,6.4939,3.6741,2.4044,1.6226,7.0142,3.3186,4.164,4.331,1.163,0.4448,2.3966,5.2629,3.5507,4.5049,0.7372,6.2147,6.6153,1.8866,3.6642,6.701,0.7473,1.6049,0.3237,3.6012,7.5544,2.2782,0.3865,3.1641,4.1127,0.1278,2.9695,0.001,0.0043,1.5518,3.1858,1.5266,6.6867,3.8926,0.0184,0.0574,0.1676,2.2959,1.0119,0.0218,4.5246,0.7694,7.8752,0.0012,0.0019,0.6636,5.4589,1.7539,1.8418,1.3596,4.1604,2.2639,0.0003,0.0003,6.025,2.3999,0.2395,0.0002,5.2508,0.0318,0.0736,7.5521,4.4585,1.6702,0.8531,5.1037,5.9479,2.9605,2.4571,5.9835,4.5873,1.7207,3.5009,3.7321,5.2353,0.7234,1.5112,4.4405,3.6382,3.7831,1.5096,0.015,0.6977,5.2819,3.0128,0.2054,0.5419,5.8767,2.6807,1.0101,0.8203,5.1906,1.4219,0.4221,6.9517,1.6988,5.5245,1.2239,1.2175,2.2553,1.7117,7.4489,0.7284,3.6416,3.874,0.0125,1.069,7.5372,1.8362,7.0112,6.6586,4.6411,4.1229,0.8845,6.7133,3.0485,1.4227,7.9275,1.5682,2.4263,1.5806,4.7321,4.7007,4.9687,2.6213,1.9804,6.7272,0.2707,1.8873,3.5382,1.4886,3.1934,6.6185,2.3487,1.98,2.4617,1.569,1.5888,5.44,4.8488,4.5963,5.302,1.2212,6.4916,1.0994,4.7377,5.4797,4.1773,2.6835,4.1719,0.002,0.0153,5.4497,5.1874,1.8298,6.162,5.2397,5.2365,6.8646,7.4577,7.0461,6.9152,1.9627,0.0003,3.6703,0.0003,0.0014,3.2145,0.2479,3.6655,4.2338,0.1821,2.4556,3.1101,0.1194,0.5676,0.862,0.0117,1.3775,3.42,2.534,2.5319,0.9557,2.0977,0.452,2.9639,1.7071,2.4915,1.445,2.5385,3.4201,1.2115,2.6202,1.2821,1.7748,0.8987,2.4847,2.8021,5.0977,6.4652,0.144,1.2968,1.381,0.8646]}

The risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy. Other chemotherapy agents, such as anthracycline, have also been associated with a high risk. The risk of AML is primarily due to the genetic predisposition of individuals in the family, the exposure to an anticancer drug (including chemotherapy and radiation therapy), and the immune system (i.e. the natural defense system against cancer).\n\nAbout 80% of leukemia patients are heterozygous and carry one mutated copy and one healthy copy. The balance of 20% of cancer patients have a defective one-half of chromosome 22. People with this genetic defect have an increased risk of developing AML.\n\nOne to five years after first exposure to chemotherapy, approximately 10 out of every 1 000 to 200 patients with AML will develop acute promyelocytic leukemia (pluripotent stem cell leukemia (PYL ) in North America and Europe.

The Germans took advantage by withdrawing much of their dreadnought fleet to the Elbe. Beatty, having no fleet company, returned home a few days later. His Grand Fleet, with eight battlecruisers, did not return until 1 December 1914.\n\nBy the time the Grand Fleet came back, the First World War was firmly under way. All the battlecruisers had fought during the early 1916 Battle of Jutland. Some, including Grand Admiral Graf Spee's Graf Spee, had been sunk. At the height of the war, the Grand Fleet consisted only of four battlecruiser squadrons, four heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and various supporting ships. As the Grand Fleet fought a desperate rear-guard action to defend against the Germans'renewed invasion in 1914, the German Navy was in decline, and both fleet and army were reduced in size. Britain's fleet was the largest in the world, with forty battlecruisers, thirteen or fourteen of which were dreadnoughts.\n\nIn addition to the dreadnoughts, the Grand Fleet had three armoured cruisers, four battlemines, eight light cruisers, five preterite cruisers, and three submarines, all at sea when the outbreak of war took place in 1914. To protect its home bases and fleet of battlecruisers, the British Admiralty also built nine battlecruiser squadrons with six to eight battlecruisers each and one or two light cruisers in each group. With the outbreak of war in 1914 the Navy also built nine preterite, or fast, cruisers intended to carry aircraft ; these were too small and expensive to have any combat value.","token_len":382,"entropy":[2.6156,5.296,0.2956,5.7211,2.8962,6.0747,0.3006,1.9563,7.125,4.6263,5.7671,0.7717,10.7533,0.4787,5.7014,3.6509,1.1415,4.8255,4.1056,0.008,0.6301,3.8167,0.4681,2.9117,4.6312,9.529,0.3618,6.2778,9.5248,0.2282,0.7032,6.2931,0.2895,5.7416,3.6756,0.0095,3.2,1.1641,1.5765,6.3602,4.4169,2.3906,6.38,6.7008,6.2991,0.0576,1.0132,8.553,0.0094,2.9998,1.61,2.4878,1.1058,9.6831,0.8492,2.0268,4.4362,0.0016,2.8627,3.7534,5.3191,4.8112,10.061,1.3743,5.6453,3.0082,5.3331,0.9167,0.4092,0.1199,1.6407,3.6272,8.6396,0.031,3.1676,3.6208,5.1368,5.5071,0.0461,0.0529,0.8094,5.8668,0.3074,2.6053,1.5669,4.5567,1.0584,1.3569,0.5547,1.2903,0.0146,3.9312,1.3595,1.5153,1.0718,3.4429,0.009,4.6936,1.7838,1.8702,1.1435,6.5133,3.1779,0.0026,1.187,6.9232,2.3393,0.0797,0.386,5.9481,1.7337,5.1732,0.1092,0.1129,1.4704,6.6448,5.8007,0.375,4.8093,8.1669,5.223,0.0144,6.0224,0.3765,0.0008,1.6709,4.9473,3.7051,1.7198,7.1049,3.1289,6.8493,2.5794,5.7168,2.7373,2.2049,9.8569,0.2372,3.3555,0.1984,2.2888,1.2049,1.1453,2.6639,2.0628,4.6256,1.2686,4.5565,0.0074,0.217,1.7927,0.5775,1.5555,3.1581,0.0125,4.8311,3.4883,0.0311,2.8175,2.2012,0.018,3.6169,2.9057,0.0,1.4484,3.3394,4.2871,1.6155,0.0012,0.738,2.7847,1.5415,0.2987,0.7025,0.6994,8.5724,6.8207,2.2546,0.3797,4.3114,0.9914,4.9372,0.0033,4.9239,4.489,3.9434,7.8196,1.1138,1.5487,5.795,2.6791,3.2365,2.6021,1.1326,3.611,16.9574,14.6702,9.3776,4.1057,3.6243,4.5405,0.1923,1.1845,2.5844,4.5811,2.4343,4.2104,6.1761,2.3735,0.9685,6.4089,6.3986,2.2806,6.7219,1.8987,3.7284,3.606,0.777,0.708,7.2832,1.2675,3.0685,1.3477,4.3975,2.1506,1.0631,0.6551,0.9246,0.9772,1.8265,6.6255,3.9337,0.0212,0.1806,1.2555,4.6092,8.4229,0.4653,5.6462,0.376,0.4585,6.629,0.0164,0.0842,0.0,0.6503,1.6688,0.0003,2.5954,3.4713,0.4451,0.8632,4.6038,0.007,0.2676,0.0017,0.3897,0.8665,2.8263,0.0041,2.2928,3.1899,5.5777,1.5447,0.0006,0.837,2.4358,3.718,10.9635,0.339,0.1764,3.8039,1.671,0.1195,0.0004,0.1175,3.3878,10.2637,5.9671,4.4999,0.4711,0.0008,0.1276,1.0896,2.5186,6.1155,2.378,1.8592,5.5305,1.7091,6.3805,0.524,5.1543,0.0049,1.3907,3.4059,0.3174,2.6516,1.4069,0.0853,5.5271,4.0437,2.2136,6.6976,4.6739,2.3238,5.8788,4.2644,3.465,0.1758,0.0642,0.3991,0.4653,2.3892,3.2496,0.0416,4.1991,4.4773,6.1344,3.6798,1.0197,1.5468,1.9191,0.0001,4.0535,3.944,6.4406,1.6715,2.4321,0.5047,0.4727,3.0335,3.6232,3.243,4.6407,0.1238,1.9482,0.181,0.0007,3.7915,2.0153,4.9773,0.3127,5.0801,1.0748,3.5765,0.0059,0.3057,2.0079,0.4814,4.0699,5.2056,4.3035,2.56,3.4655,6.5961,0.0056,0.0558,5.6657,4.1624,6.5079,2.9367,1.5136,0.0016,9.3137,0.5195,3.3796,7.1467,11.8921,2.8245,1.1332,6.9233,1.2009,2.2924,4.7364,0.2677,4.5197,2.0272,4.5499,2.0835,0.7846]}

{"id":547,"ended":true,"length":287,"text":"Short proteins can also be synthesized chemically by a family of methods known as peptide synthesis, which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce peptides in high yield. Chemical ligation involves the reaction of chemically synthesized carboxymethylpeptides (\"C-peptides\") with amino acids or amino acid analogs. The ligation affords products which possess identical properties to natural peptides (see for instance \"The Peptides\", Edited by M. F. B. Eds., Marcel Decker, Inc., Stuttgart, 1974) and can be employed to produce highly homogeneous and reproducible peptides by solid-phase synthesis.\nThe C-peptide (i.e., the carboxy terminal portion of a.beta.-amino acid) is not only a component of the native biological activity of a certain peptide.beta.-chain, but a precursor of the peptide itself as well as a building block or intermediate in the synthesis and assembly of peptides or small molecules (see \"Peptide Synthesis in Molecular Biology\", Edited by L. M. P. Dey et al., Elsevier Advanced Science series, Stony Brook, 1988). The C-peptide can function as a chemical bond to amino acid residues within native peptides, allowing for the production of peptides which have identical (i.e., native) activity and properties as native peptides. Peptide production can be performed on a solid support matrix and involves a covalent chemical bond between the carboxy terminus of a.beta.- amino acid and the amino terminus of a C-peptide (see the above-mentioned U.S. Patents and EP 0 036 971 A2).\nC-peptides have only been produced in batch reactions, using solid-phase synthesis.","token_len":382,"entropy":[11.4715,3.8333,2.5744,1.1136,3.5744,0.104,7.4351,2.2606,3.5972,6.7544,0.0324,7.1991,3.2692,0.0205,5.2616,0.7698,2.4386,2.5728,1.2111,7.5763,0.0908,6.9491,3.954,5.3789,3.0687,0.0005,4.6734,7.6462,3.3885,4.1397,2.4115,2.1541,0.2251,3.5286,6.6434,5.3764,0.8467,6.4537,1.0767,0.0009,2.7802,1.6594,6.7717,0.0478,6.1712,2.9517,0.072,8.4282,0.0219,2.4652,0.0597,8.6342,0.0007,0.711,6.3022,3.3535,4.5578,0.6396,0.003,0.0571,0.3361,0.8393,3.4671,0.1953,3.4587,2.1494,1.9439,4.5826,0.8718,1.755,1.7737,5.3797,0.0038,11.8309,0.0261,7.1779,4.4897,5.2407,7.2792,2.1742,1.2024,5.029,0.9168,0.0789,3.3193,3.5925,4.798,3.1992,4.6019,3.2271,4.6497,0.0117,0.6558,4.9076,12.4301,0.3885,4.6897,0.2606,4.5021,0.4616,4.8018,2.7365,7.661,3.6141,2.151,9.7961,11.1227,1.0076,5.9628,0.3122,4.9467,1.581,0.0003,0.2009,6.1274,2.2785,1.027,3.48,0.8758,5.3505,0.8918,1.7304,4.6957,6.2895,0.6027,2.8779,4.989,0.0215,0.4513,0.085,4.1037,9.032,2.2499,0.7885,2.7705,0.8418,1.8232,8.8853,5.3139,0.15,0.0587,0.0007,1.2966,4.2855,6.2083,0.1525,0.0033,0.4757,1.4719,4.4614,0.0105,1.7732,11.6474,6.3185,0.276,1.7592,9.9742,10.4669,9.491,5.718,0.2413,1.4651,0.9562,0.9431,5.3763,2.8035,1.7596,5.8123,0.1744,1.1465,8.0261,6.5853,5.254,0.2508,2.504,4.191,2.3876,0.0782,3.5819,15.3448,3.9291,12.2244,2.6786,0.632,3.8537,4.047,1.1377,0.9876,2.8238,0.1129,2.9199,2.9714,0.0764,3.7486,1.5675,6.9072,0.0511,5.2795,5.475,2.8216,0.791,2.1586,3.0188,4.9204,0.1599,2.5229,0.1255,5.6821,8.214,0.8004,2.0394,1.2903,1.4364,3.7783,0.0131,1.5772,1.597,0.0712,3.3628,4.5952,0.8091,0.6722,2.3965,0.0293,3.8343,0.0673,2.7659,0.071,4.3741,1.1835,5.2995,5.469,3.4633,0.011,0.0978,5.9302,0.0,10.6675,2.2704,13.2274,0.5378,3.4597,10.462,0.0464,0.5024,4.777,0.7046,1.7826,1.6998,0.0309,0.0327,0.0012,0.0367,3.2859,6.8276,0.4289,0.3773,4.9314,3.7007,3.7322,4.6139,2.279,2.062,4.0987,9.9624,1.0626,0.1672,1.6033,4.2636,1.7636,1.0706,3.1151,0.0456,2.1605,0.1169,2.1687,2.2493,2.7789,6.0531,2.8615,0.004,0.0022,0.0376,6.465,0.2728,5.1751,2.1703,1.9136,2.3516,4.1018,0.4929,0.0591,0.6788,6.1842,0.0126,1.3248,3.9912,1.9872,0.6014,2.9943,3.4893,1.3116,7.3815,11.1279,5.263,3.438,6.9514,2.6209,6.7414,0.5491,0.1968,5.1252,0.5868,1.4134,0.8026,3.3847,0.001,0.2762,2.983,0.1946,0.8671,1.5015,2.636,0.519,0.099,7.4691,0.1003,0.4853,0.8511,2.6822,5.998,0.0163,0.1429,0.9133,5.0752,0.0812,0.1103,0.001,0.0124,2.0497,1.4492,3.2212,5.0035,3.3145,0.769,8.5579,0.7284,0.3714,0.0843,3.9739,4.78,3.3481,15.2228,8.2293,9.5547,4.7931,6.7281,5.2998,6.5953,4.3096,3.5279,1.3929,4.1834,0.2597,0.0791,0.0009,0.4487,2.953,5.5083,2.5423,4.5026,1.2447,10.9595,3.3529,1.9144,4.9883,5.8455,0.864,0.0536,1.8322,1.5889]}

It's fun and cool and it's almost like being in college again. I don't know where it's going to land on the charts and all that stuff, but it's fun and its definitely more rock than my solo stuff.

{"id":4490,"ended":true,"length":346,"text":"Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II was first unveiled in North America as part of the 1989 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada and was displayed with other games to be released by Sega of America in the next summer months. The game was a sequel to Sega's arcade action game Sega's own, Ironsword, released in 1985. It was published by Sega in North America through distributor U.S. Gold & Associates. Sega also created a website for the game which contained the Ironsword name along with information on the next game in the series, Warriors II. The web site, though, never came to be.\n\nAfter its debut at CES '89, Ironsword was shown at the 1988 International CES held from January 4 to 7, in Las Vegas. Once again, as on the previous occasion, it was shown alongside another unnamed project that was planned to come out later in 1988.\n\nTwo years after the arcade release of Ironsword, Sega and U.S. Gold and Associates unveiled in Las Vegas the company's upcoming game Wizards & Warriors II. The game was also given an official website that contained a number of screenshots from the game, as well as details of the game's soundtrack. While the game wasn't released in the U.S., the website and the screenshots were eventually included in the game's arcade history CD as part of Sega's Warriors II compilation, which was released in the U.S. in 1994.\n\nThough nothing more substantial than a screenshot has surfaced until now of this upcoming arcade sequel, this site shows some similarities of the Wizards & Warriors' series which can be observed on the second and third screens (from left) in the screen below.\n\nAt this website, which was eventually taken down, you can view the following screen where Wizards & Warriors II is compared head-to-head with Ironswords.","token_len":382,"entropy":[11.4113,9.4922,6.2494,9.4278,6.0315,2.0053,5.5117,8.2403,5.3649,7.4889,1.3519,6.0699,0.0933,3.3635,1.6347,0.001,1.1673,7.996,5.3556,9.3472,0.5089,0.0743,2.1717,0.949,0.0002,1.8764,1.0421,3.799,1.8973,7.8563,4.3347,4.669,3.9401,5.3957,3.4368,1.1872,2.9765,4.8457,4.3222,0.0755,1.9057,1.5236,6.4171,6.045,9.967,0.1919,2.0635,1.5466,1.2171,3.3644,3.3016,0.168,4.9207,0.4574,5.349,4.2977,1.4338,4.7159,3.6879,9.4639,5.1663,8.2798,1.2027,0.1322,1.8011,2.3572,0.4447,4.2294,0.5489,2.4447,0.8675,5.6773,0.4917,1.0185,1.1176,1.847,0.0204,5.0953,7.914,6.0052,0.9346,0.0695,0.0344,4.6143,4.3487,6.1024,1.24,3.5404,2.9971,4.8993,2.247,7.0652,1.6429,1.0432,0.463,4.4042,4.934,2.724,6.4804,0.0018,0.0232,5.0836,5.5197,0.0063,3.5881,1.2411,1.3102,7.2322,2.6107,1.9171,0.2837,0.3441,1.7318,8.1921,0.2181,0.3904,1.8494,5.3619,0.2815,4.0276,5.4226,1.1286,4.161,3.9133,0.472,1.6989,0.8957,1.4176,0.0567,5.3011,3.6038,3.785,2.9975,3.6072,6.6164,3.0553,0.3934,1.2036,0.0012,0.0066,1.2213,5.4522,1.1653,1.4752,5.451,3.6274,3.7511,4.5259,6.7006,3.0257,3.6127,1.3887,2.6291,1.0527,5.484,0.8382,0.0003,0.8111,7.0766,0.5896,0.4167,5.4933,6.5922,1.3937,2.5841,3.1783,0.274,2.4896,0.5259,1.7137,3.8255,4.8728,8.898,6.0274,3.0651,1.2642,5.609,1.698,4.0595,1.1595,2.6096,1.2507,3.9543,0.6089,1.7482,0.0002,6.0287,1.5058,1.5811,1.1323,5.2504,1.8311,0.8913,0.6634,0.001,0.0068,0.3635,0.9595,3.9742,3.7084,0.0211,0.0025,0.0108,0.0676,3.2711,0.0246,5.791,6.2201,4.2648,0.0003,1.7115,5.814,0.076,4.5216,3.1794,5.5146,1.096,0.0047,0.0967,1.0617,1.4053,0.6852,0.9189,4.1148,5.1539,2.4777,1.7525,5.4566,3.8154,2.5982,2.3642,4.1239,0.004,3.1448,2.5308,0.4655,0.5633,1.716,2.7791,0.032,0.0076,4.7449,1.2246,0.8571,1.5937,0.3612,5.6619,0.7555,4.6907,1.2396,1.3908,4.4702,0.0005,1.2964,1.5406,1.9874,1.2589,0.0007,0.0061,0.1852,1.3996,3.1808,4.8593,1.8857,4.1057,1.0014,4.607,3.8688,0.605,0.8301,1.6237,0.4199,6.571,8.5447,7.2022,3.6358,1.0201,0.0012,3.3114,0.1041,9.5181,0.4005,3.8499,2.4064,1.2573,1.0754,0.6363,0.6867,2.6109,1.2404,0.0011,0.0199,0.0419,1.0444,3.303,0.2271,0.6018,0.0002,5.824,7.236,4.3766,6.0942,1.6175,1.8352,6.7862,5.2775,3.673,7.7905,0.4106,5.8228,4.6518,3.7385,5.6713,3.8694,0.472,3.4494,6.3385,4.0962,3.5743,4.7925,4.9653,1.1574,7.5992,0.0617,0.0009,7.3048,5.1344,5.5497,5.3956,0.2375,5.7331,2.2672,0.7564,5.9594,2.9444,0.1644,2.4506,4.884,4.6512,0.7875,3.2367,2.8662,0.5465,5.7234,3.5108,0.4353,0.9759,0.0002,5.3166,2.3068,6.5166,0.6797,4.9857,1.8303,5.5895,2.7611,0.0763,1.2813,2.5627,0.2432,3.7238,1.2955,4.4026,4.0348,5.0987,2.9751,0.082,0.0004,0.1334,1.6468,6.7519,9.9439,0.6641,0.0916,0.001,0.0168,1.0273,2.294,0.0014,4.816,1.63]}

The magazine also included Heartbreaking as one of the best albums of the decade in its The Year in Music issue. Pitchfork critic Robert Christgau ranked 808s & Heartbreak at number ten on his list of the best albums of 2007, and described it as, \"a brilliant set of very specific sounds and ideas, a masterclass of what Kanye was up to in 2008.\" On October 31, 2008, he ranked it the number one album of the year, stating that, \"The final album in a trilogy of brilliant work, 808s & Heartbreak sees Kanye West in his most mature, thoughtful \u2014 and, we think, musical \u2014 period to date. On his first album of 2009, Watch the Throne, he is working with Jay-Z again, both men clearly having learned what works from their last meeting. For all his fame, they should know where he ended up last year, or at least have a sense of where and how to take Kanye West from here.\" The album was also voted the third-best album of 2008 by P4K\n\nKanye West is a rapper and record producer from Chicago, Illinois, known for his extensive use of autotune, sampling, and 808s beats and bass...read more.\n\nNews\n\nMTV To Air Video For Free\n\nMTV is putting the video online for free to promote both the album and the video-centric web network.\n\nApr 08, 2009\n\nKanye West: 808s and Heartbreaks\n\nThis review was originally written in April 2006 and first appeared in the December issue of URB.","token_len":382,"entropy":[5.7574,6.0617,9.2207,2.0439,6.1218,7.1807,1.641,7.6137,0.3546,1.8486,0.4493,3.7466,3.3413,1.0394,6.3873,7.0675,4.0087,4.4522,4.3143,5.7029,6.0997,2.5712,1.4121,2.0108,8.5537,3.6007,5.7531,0.6884,2.0025,1.1266,1.8505,2.2035,2.5164,1.954,0.0064,0.3149,3.4949,0.6184,0.8728,0.1252,2.2525,0.4409,0.532,1.5557,0.0062,1.9071,9.4454,0.0014,0.1831,6.3937,1.2099,1.3417,6.1683,0.2102,0.3315,2.2989,7.0453,1.8523,5.0424,5.7563,5.2031,1.6781,1.6861,0.016,1.0447,3.0445,1.7011,0.1087,1.8695,4.1075,3.0097,1.2698,6.5149,4.6595,2.7219,2.0977,4.5359,0.6298,8.9822,0.0002,7.9443,4.4312,8.9563,3.8896,0.1559,4.6667,9.7762,0.1798,0.5848,0.0008,0.0147,3.1559,1.6085,4.1579,2.0394,2.8321,0.974,0.1295,0.6964,2.0697,0.4211,0.1265,3.6069,1.7023,1.7807,6.858,0.9616,0.0433,6.3841,0.1798,1.0849,4.4121,6.7625,0.294,6.6267,5.5796,4.6097,1.8271,4.0739,1.924,3.3877,5.2762,1.5939,3.3491,4.5758,8.3245,4.0156,3.9894,0.2766,1.2545,2.8068,0.6973,5.324,3.5354,4.0184,0.3965,1.247,0.1016,4.1835,7.0823,2.4278,3.4445,3.5269,0.3459,1.3044,0.1405,1.2644,0.1343,2.1753,6.0809,1.323,1.4575,0.1398,2.7055,6.1923,2.5279,2.419,2.9157,2.814,0.8131,5.0308,5.1005,1.806,2.0853,0.0656,0.1071,0.0027,0.0074,7.9157,1.6788,5.8619,4.3572,1.8424,2.8248,5.7385,1.7987,4.3827,9.0933,0.3824,3.6278,6.7625,2.6566,0.1155,7.7897,0.2979,6.5871,5.2547,0.5849,1.2795,5.1028,2.8872,2.8522,1.4508,3.5274,3.7208,0.1523,9.054,2.1522,0.0118,0.3453,1.6656,3.9773,5.3492,1.6965,5.8589,0.8907,0.0004,6.0134,1.1394,5.1711,8.1391,6.5404,4.0851,4.5878,4.2352,4.3902,4.45,2.9699,5.6656,5.0743,1.7006,5.0106,2.8069,1.2295,8.2523,0.6223,5.8232,5.9055,4.064,5.0992,1.6759,6.6975,0.0971,6.0255,0.6168,1.6676,4.8278,2.0227,0.1484,3.6058,2.0125,3.7773,0.172,1.3338,6.0487,1.1144,2.0279,4.0282,6.5715,1.8732,3.1817,0.8922,0.6866,2.9791,1.0286,1.5317,1.7986,2.3906,0.8501,4.4775,3.1376,0.2221,0.6392,0.1093,0.6637,0.6486,4.5527,11.7982,2.9669,7.3455,0.0049,4.2152,0.0377,0.3601,3.0625,2.5757,3.9874,1.8944,4.9546,0.3444,3.2768,1.4843,0.7786,0.2909,1.5238,3.2747,0.2419,0.2972,6.2604,3.609,0.0161,9.7572,1.7966,0.3338,0.9895,6.0181,0.5466,0.7784,4.4817,0.3541,6.1138,3.3907,7.2507,11.4482,5.3253,0.0508,3.9143,1.4041,0.0003,8.7747,1.7485,0.0002,5.8845,4.2675,8.0163,6.7606,4.6719,4.4854,8.2166,2.6568,0.0004,2.9901,0.018,2.7312,5.452,3.1389,4.7645,3.8437,1.1234,1.5928,2.9661,1.7641,7.5646,1.6923,2.7309,0.3512,1.2216,3.8583,6.507,5.7908,5.0737,7.9442,2.6043,1.5662,0.0003,9.2738,5.529,0.1594,1.6558,1.817,0.0004,2.7963,0.0403,0.1374,3.1437,7.9308,0.024,3.198,0.0021,6.4424,2.6624,0.0004,5.1342,7.2525,1.6231,1.3518,4.0935,2.2813,2.2608,4.0409,1.8044,4.7296,0.5029,0.9284,1.2681,4.4075,4.4424,0.1748,6.5524,4.8151,4.7993]}
{"id":2268,"ended":true,"length":350,"text":"In 2000, Pressman released two board game adaptions of Millionaire as well as a junior edition recommended for younger players. Several video games based on the varying gameplay formats of Millionaire have also been released, including the Windows-only PC game, Millionaire (2000), released by Gameloft, and the iOS and Android mobile games Millionaire (2014), Millionaire Classic (2016), and \"Millionaire Mastermind\" (2017).[4]\n\nAn iOS game called Millionaire has existed for a while now, but nothing like the PC and console versions. At the time of this writing, and I've never played it before, but looks like you only need to answer one question correctly to win (i.e. the game only requires one answer), and everything else is done for you. If not, it really seems like you can just pick a number at random off of the wall to get a win. And the \"game\" also appears to be in constant \"developement\".\n\nThe Millionaire games were both developed by Pressman, and published by Infocom. I've been looking around for a copy of the original PC release for years, and for whatever reason have never found and one for sale. It was released in the mid-1980s, and it seems that Pressman is out of business. However, I have seen a number of his earlier titles for sale on eBay. If anyone out there has the original PC or PS1\/2\/3 game, and wants to sell it (or wants to trade it for something I own of similar value), shoot me a PM.\n\nYeah I don't think the newer versions are a game. Looks like you need to memorize a list of answers and the way each board is laid out in order to win. It looks like you also need to pay attention to the clues\/questions.","token_len":382,"entropy":[8.7508,0.2172,10.2782,2.947,5.5862,4.4597,10.9901,4.4275,8.0239,0.3138,0.7923,9.7132,2.5588,7.3178,1.8191,0.1396,1.2399,10.8684,3.778,11.4443,2.3264,4.6253,1.3825,0.3311,6.8546,7.3247,0.3662,5.2815,0.124,0.7959,13.454,6.1676,6.2743,2.7575,2.5568,0.0038,1.5526,2.6441,0.4346,0.5416,1.8743,1.0075,1.8581,8.2846,2.7609,1.359,5.8407,1.8656,2.484,3.5489,0.1108,4.4266,3.5091,0.7507,3.4637,2.8216,5.4454,1.2948,0.0112,2.6716,1.3848,0.6932,4.9413,2.7054,0.1297,2.1581,0.7083,3.5986,0.0154,1.7096,6.2595,1.2713,4.5357,0.0035,5.3978,0.2813,2.0827,0.4133,0.1831,6.2909,2.1815,0.0234,0.0371,6.5432,2.9744,0.6377,0.114,1.4667,6.6928,2.9277,0.214,0.5244,0.0002,5.6398,5.8746,1.3875,3.0323,1.0056,0.0121,3.78,7.1467,2.2117,2.0331,1.3258,2.2386,0.9034,1.5111,6.0014,3.9585,0.9314,5.2165,3.8306,4.913,0.3554,1.297,5.6939,1.0461,0.4395,0.2921,2.1709,0.0506,0.113,6.4514,7.8283,3.6895,3.4617,1.4197,1.457,3.9759,0.2514,6.8959,8.815,0.0943,5.039,7.4407,1.0284,0.5048,10.1805,2.1365,0.3584,7.9452,1.9093,4.8947,4.3541,4.6256,0.0627,0.0003,0.7955,3.1566,1.1819,5.5853,2.6342,3.1996,5.675,3.3388,2.2467,8.0933,1.208,0.9139,4.1238,2.8714,0.262,0.7214,3.7902,5.6805,0.4641,2.9633,5.6866,4.9829,0.7041,1.5562,2.6656,3.222,3.8107,2.095,3.9413,5.266,0.1419,7.7634,1.2395,1.0124,5.3798,2.6346,2.3751,2.0264,4.7098,0.7899,4.7843,3.2391,4.2995,4.1526,0.8201,5.2951,4.2427,0.4709,0.827,4.0874,6.3191,6.003,5.796,3.7257,2.8622,1.0352,0.0002,2.4198,5.5112,0.0056,5.162,2.5723,5.2654,3.0347,0.6237,5.3449,0.0067,1.5352,1.2329,3.5934,0.5137,7.1434,1.3517,1.1971,4.7088,2.0755,2.659,4.4537,3.5644,1.0621,1.5152,2.5181,0.4169,0.6174,2.5505,5.3209,4.9082,2.188,3.1533,0.8758,0.4852,5.8557,5.118,0.1851,3.645,1.0336,1.2111,6.8741,9.1389,4.9929,4.3453,0.7974,2.6334,2.848,2.8609,1.2936,2.991,3.3332,0.4652,2.5279,0.0874,1.025,0.8726,2.589,3.1162,1.613,2.5608,0.0019,2.9135,6.4938,0.3506,2.3923,0.8357,4.4076,0.0609,2.0322,2.2206,3.1304,1.9628,2.268,0.0345,6.8396,5.5535,3.0377,4.4485,0.7789,2.1422,1.1892,2.3782,3.9856,3.2722,3.8997,0.0099,1.0896,3.0992,2.2108,1.4607,4.4163,4.2928,2.4196,5.1032,0.4724,3.1526,0.1212,2.9702,0.8863,3.599,2.9312,0.518,3.4145,0.4146,4.343,1.954,5.6035,0.523,5.463,0.6684,0.9498,1.5904,5.9579,5.1467,7.2421,4.5879,2.242,0.4122,6.7246,0.144,1.1224,2.7762,1.3767,0.8464,0.0002,9.2538,3.9114,4.1152,0.001,2.2266,3.1539,7.8896,1.8444,1.4543,4.2092,5.077,3.0736,8.2334,0.0813,3.6499,2.1249,0.4351,7.0407,0.0397,2.1951,3.1584,0.1954,6.2329,2.8413,3.9367,6.5214,4.6548,6.1576,1.3425,3.4798,0.1051,2.6085,1.9962,0.1364,1.7739,0.787,3.4168,2.7661,0.2813,1.341,4.8038,0.4062,0.1471,5.012,0.8041,0.0691,1.0029,6.3281,5.7426,5.0174,1.2767,2.2132]}

Today our economy is collapsing, our industry is in ruins, our society is being undermined, and the people are suffering. We must decide now what we must do. I will leave it to you, the people, to decide this.\n\nThis is your government, your country and your destiny.\n\nOn one side you have socialism, as it always existed. On the other side you have individualism, that of the bourgeoisie and of fascism.\n\nThe only way to save your country is to choose the one that has worked and proved itself : socialism.\n\nWhat you should do now is to go out on to the streets and in order for the people to choose that is will do so, you must organise yourselves and make all efforts so that they all find their way to the same places.\n\nThe Party must decide what it should do. The Party, that is to say the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, which have always led this country, have always defended the working people, will do so now as well.\n\nIt is up to you, my dear friends, to take decisions, to unite, to bring all those out on to the streets who want to lead this country. I will be by your sides always. I will urge everyone to help those to lead the country to the right way, both in the public and private sector.\n\nThere must be discipline among the Party and the people, and there must be unity.\n\nI ask all of you for complete loyalty and friendship, for help with every effort.","token_len":382,"entropy":[7.0338,3.2723,1.1492,5.6536,1.9339,5.9547,5.2737,1.8292,1.4277,2.9014,8.0266,0.497,1.9871,0.2068,9.9039,4.7503,2.3224,10.6611,5.0714,0.0579,1.1224,3.2297,1.2909,7.3534,1.9583,5.0139,0.0054,0.3479,9.7369,5.5457,0.5295,3.0798,3.3494,0.0622,0.4461,3.9642,8.7851,2.0104,2.2281,0.6054,7.3361,4.459,3.9975,0.8373,5.2023,3.7676,0.0153,3.378,0.3141,2.4881,0.428,0.4993,0.0014,1.3268,3.7635,7.4062,0.757,0.9032,0.0002,2.1194,1.4439,4.724,0.938,2.7072,4.5062,1.8528,5.0815,4.0256,4.9401,0.5816,3.6622,1.4895,1.7185,5.4583,0.3793,3.1817,3.2661,0.5978,0.7875,5.3471,0.2901,3.0419,3.9391,1.35,0.9493,2.0783,2.7133,1.2316,2.5267,1.3417,1.683,2.1782,5.4863,2.9978,2.0506,1.694,2.3754,0.1196,1.661,3.3449,3.0523,5.4294,2.454,0.2964,0.4897,2.1318,2.1173,1.4193,0.8768,0.469,1.19,3.1371,1.6991,1.3146,0.0002,4.3831,0.709,3.8138,4.0688,1.5059,2.7609,2.2635,2.2854,0.6997,4.1327,0.2901,1.7982,0.0001,5.1385,6.7659,1.1259,2.1191,1.1951,8.5473,0.5847,5.6863,3.6124,3.7899,6.0414,1.6748,0.6087,0.0088,0.0027,0.6787,0.6484,0.146,7.6668,0.2326,0.8044,5.4219,3.7273,1.3191,4.1582,2.1465,2.1553,6.584,0.3874,1.0356,0.0001,2.5524,4.0405,1.5334,0.7022,2.9793,2.3724,0.4291,0.4403,0.6471,5.3082,1.9413,3.4872,1.5805,3.399,6.016,2.6196,6.154,1.6912,11.208,2.3058,0.5377,0.6925,0.0002,5.1043,2.1401,4.2363,0.8322,1.6398,0.1895,0.7631,4.1258,3.5654,2.5687,5.3773,0.8157,0.6795,1.1074,4.8577,4.1147,4.9557,1.4732,0.9871,0.2485,3.1401,4.219,5.2969,7.4252,4.5514,4.7283,2.1958,3.4592,0.9011,5.319,2.6953,1.6621,3.7939,4.5834,4.2359,5.0647,0.3186,3.5537,5.0112,5.0757,2.1383,0.7422,0.6613,0.9666,6.0738,4.553,1.1976,0.4918,0.0001,2.4899,7.0235,2.6233,4.1496,2.6148,2.2414,3.4679,0.2421,1.6687,2.6856,2.3369,4.7017,4.4188,0.2848,2.7687,0.0193,0.9224,5.0446,0.851,3.2974,0.5981,2.8681,0.1136,0.74,4.8306,2.8163,2.8965,4.9998,3.3927,0.6571,0.8258,3.7269,1.4194,5.8505,1.0443,4.4518,1.6316,1.9383,5.9827,2.1921,1.7135,3.1949,3.9917,1.6297,0.5658,0.4972,0.0001,3.4099,0.6005,4.2439,0.0083,0.8931,1.0254,4.1546,4.5876,2.9744,0.3184,0.421,3.8622,5.9759,2.4515,1.7206,6.0549,3.5992,0.5011,4.7753,4.699,3.5454,6.976,2.6661,3.3576,0.1404,0.1268,4.2609,2.9333,0.296,5.0602,1.9627,0.1677,1.7025,4.1963,2.2471,2.7942,7.1244,0.5527,9.1463,6.2395,1.0844,2.1762,0.7656,6.8045,3.5071,0.681,4.3283,4.1783,5.5142,3.4841,1.1002,1.0138,3.6585,1.5212,3.3882,3.384,1.9318,6.4038,1.6371,1.5344,4.3259,0.3555,0.6444,2.3939,0.4656,0.4951,0.0001,4.4322,3.0504,0.1697,7.2871,4.156,0.8657,5.472,2.0694,1.4573,1.4374,1.3799,1.8303,2.6458,0.0936,0.0522,3.8762,2.7073,1.3943,0.0001,2.4009,3.3601,2.332,1.5217,0.075,4.9052,8.864,3.5333,1.5137,4.4048,1.7357,1.8155,6.6855,2.6233,4.1492,3.0514,1.7901]}

Indian Navy has so far deployed three Scorpene submarines at Visakhapatnam and Kochi for training.Indian Navy sources said the deployment included long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft and helicopters to monitor the movement of naval ships. The deployment will be further enhanced as Indian Navy deploys all three of their ships \u2014 INS Chennai, INS Kolkata and INS Chennai to the South China Sea.The Navy\u2019s deployment to the region would coincide with heightened Chinese deployment in the region.The submarine deployment would serve as a deterrent against the presence of the Chinese submarines in the Indian Ocean and the Malacca Strait, the sources said.India had deployed its nuclear submarine INS Chakra and INS Tarang to monitor the situation on Doklam plateau in 2017.","token_len":382,"entropy":[11.6045,0.0931,4.5722,1.0263,11.8207,0.0105,4.0035,0.8498,7.7177,0.9815,6.8403,0.1258,0.0084,2.8132,0.9845,6.6829,0.872,5.3919,0.0173,7.5289,3.5854,7.3647,9.3195,8.4251,7.733,3.0165,2.4377,7.9398,0.0093,0.03,2.2219,7.1097,1.7872,2.8095,0.2056,5.7613,5.1883,2.6327,0.5843,1.6099,9.645,0.0034,3.1524,0.8223,1.1061,2.015,3.561,4.6396,1.1794,3.4949,3.6501,5.3346,0.2066,4.571,0.1852,0.8271,0.0006,0.0018,1.821,1.7966,6.3518,1.1806,1.2619,6.1517,1.9611,2.6887,2.0997,6.3004,7.3759,0.0463,2.9821,8.6859,0.9448,0.6448,1.5898,1.0455,0.0005,3.0134,5.4312,2.0076,4.7752,8.253,1.8253,3.1296,5.701,1.8997,2.3061,5.3701,2.083,1.3861,7.0236,1.5725,5.3318,0.043,5.6594,3.2858,1.3068,1.6627,5.8606,3.5318,5.8913,1.4584,0.826,6.1256,2.8697,7.4098,5.6375,6.2812,6.7468,2.0373,2.4978,6.856,0.1084,7.191,0.1201,5.2497,0.4681,17.41,7.5651,6.1404,8.7927,1.1174,0.6889,2.9477,2.3725,15.7554,0.2509,0.2578,7.378,0.7051,0.0012,0.0252,2.9732,0.0019,2.0588,6.9293,0.0002,0.61,2.2348,1.4277,1.253,3.3457,1.1028,6.788,0.6285,2.3813,1.5072,0.3956,3.2673,6.5018,0.7395,6.5304,2.3977,6.5612,1.0143,6.5459,3.1926,0.0271,0.9408,1.5295,2.7427,5.5837,7.1238,6.629,2.5623,3.9038,6.5819,2.9507,1.0902,6.9203,1.0621,4.5819,1.405,0.0233,1.5729,4.0401,0.8948,6.6064,0.1663,4.9931,8.479,3.007,3.3802,4.7411,1.5836,6.0104,11.5257,1.7839,2.672,0.031,1.5895,1.1018,4.4226,6.089,5.651,2.4628,0.4994,0.9223,0.2673,0.6203,1.779,1.1727,0.0086,0.0008,0.1826,8.8229,0.6998,0.0012,0.0023,1.1581,3.5763,0.0085,4.3716,1.0308,8.3876,3.9594,1.9197,2.1671,4.0133,2.0915,3.1597,4.0814,3.5325,4.845,3.1881,2.4471,3.4082,0.4247,6.0777,0.8561,4.7829,0.9729,3.4883,5.1145,0.0005,1.2251,3.0248,2.7305,0.0925,3.4467,4.3685,9.1103,0.0504,0.0005,0.0011,0.0,1.4476,5.6647,0.0683,3.8338,2.411,1.7088,4.0592,0.7273,5.033,0.4068,1.0317,2.8391,7.3623,8.4951,0.1921,0.2067,4.62,3.7138,2.4774,1.5091,4.3984,3.3456,2.5979,1.5,4.2316,0.0684,5.0558,2.5268,1.3897,2.1188,2.6699,2.5941,1.4532,5.1366,1.5923,3.0739,3.1291,0.67,4.9415,0.0873,5.6669,1.5553,3.4431,4.4354,4.0219,6.7956,1.5887,5.9798,0.3767,0.0374,2.7275,1.7996,0.0004,0.415,0.0164,3.1735,5.6308,1.5708,2.82,1.6024,0.0209,0.6837,1.6938,4.5341,10.9221,0.4874,0.0261,5.1023,1.6771,1.204,3.1662,3.6492,5.2502,0.0126,7.737,5.5191,6.0684,2.5046,0.3715,1.0307,1.0479,2.3722,5.2636,1.3788,2.9385,5.6397,0.4655,0.5408,3.0648,1.7351,2.1024,3.6575,0.0283,2.5936,1.997,4.2415,1.206,0.4249,1.8859,0.0871,2.8075,2.72,8.5225,0.4853,0.1952,1.2167,2.4415,0.8556,0.1278,0.1651,2.9159,3.9438,1.543,2.1877,2.2469,0.2965,0.0489,1.3144,0.0007,3.5234,3.4627,8.1141,3.5261,3.9683,4.5012,0.5337,3.9599,2.4188,7.2238,3.2181,0.0278,8.8006,1.3635,6.8897,0.7366]}

As Pelayo notes, `` Love in the Time of Cholera, like all of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's work, explores the idea of loneliness in a new light. Although he has a beautiful wife -- and, of course, Marquez himself, who is a kind of a romantic in himself -- he still misses the love and companionship that he did in his childhood.\n\nOne day his mother comes with a letter from his wife, asking him if everything is alright, and he finally gets a glimpse of what life outside of his old and lonely town could be like. That's when he decides to put his old house up for sale and go somewhere else.\n\nThe only person who has ever bought his place is a very old beggar named Lola, who lives alone in his bedroom and steals a daily dose of the good coffee he brings to her everyday.\n\nHe also meets a young man named Gil P\u00e9rez and begins to fall in love with both of them. The only thing that he hates more than loneliness is his love life. He also starts to develop a small crush on a mysterious woman named Beatriz, who moves to town in the company of Gil P\u00e9rez.\n\nP\u00e9rez asks Gil where Lola goes every day, and Gil says that she just goes to his bedroom and begs for money from him before she leaves again. On the other hand, Gil thinks that she's a lonely older woman who just needs someone who understands her. He says that he only pretends to give her money so she won't become angry and attack him. When P\u00e9rez asks Gil if the woman says anything about buying a house from him, Gil says that she didn't, and P\u00e9rez realizes that he's attracted to the woman too.","token_len":382,"entropy":[9.018,0.8771,12.7565,6.5185,1.8054,4.9673,0.0428,10.7455,0.0427,2.6627,0.0062,0.0053,0.0002,0.1119,3.2296,0.9691,4.2878,11.3885,5.6053,0.5862,3.0715,0.409,10.7773,13.3801,3.7975,1.3,6.5659,0.0564,6.1877,1.7977,0.2676,2.2099,5.4308,3.0525,3.343,6.7064,0.1408,0.002,0.0112,0.0069,0.0016,0.0032,0.1379,2.5405,0.1239,6.2066,0.6145,4.6249,0.4204,4.3831,2.2449,1.4234,3.8337,1.7866,1.2634,5.5359,3.081,2.6848,3.0642,5.8328,4.4301,7.2403,2.2853,3.8161,2.7762,0.0077,0.0036,7.5611,6.2193,4.1545,2.1286,1.8465,1.5302,2.2756,4.9984,1.7772,3.7279,4.4797,4.1965,4.3024,0.9202,1.4208,4.1443,5.6138,1.5936,3.9282,2.793,5.5238,0.0036,1.2491,2.6781,5.5987,3.1925,1.2417,2.3367,1.0523,4.8645,0.0015,4.4503,3.6031,4.9591,2.5218,3.1718,3.914,1.1814,3.1157,0.7923,2.064,4.6729,1.2,2.7074,1.3962,2.2328,7.1248,1.1223,2.2237,2.109,0.6347,1.1335,6.5778,3.9766,2.0555,4.0077,0.3338,2.4543,3.1789,7.0647,0.6778,2.1376,6.7527,6.838,2.9101,4.7272,3.6891,0.2953,0.1147,0.2978,5.211,1.537,0.4374,1.212,3.499,0.2958,4.8398,1.3918,5.107,3.3459,1.7655,0.078,0.082,2.3375,3.6066,5.0786,2.4683,0.4198,2.1453,0.0002,2.3803,4.9085,4.2389,0.8811,3.3527,2.2176,4.8351,2.0183,4.7568,1.001,2.6952,4.1439,3.5987,7.534,0.0015,1.2813,4.6784,3.5857,1.3709,0.3772,2.6248,2.827,0.8555,2.6347,5.1437,2.467,6.0494,3.3169,7.9892,2.4507,0.0215,2.9483,5.33,5.6148,1.5504,4.4754,1.8372,3.674,4.9107,0.2041,2.4038,0.0002,3.7779,3.9869,3.6923,1.3294,1.9321,1.8537,0.3824,6.8808,6.7529,2.1015,0.0093,3.4647,4.1234,0.4353,4.175,0.2005,0.0021,0.2744,5.507,0.5708,0.0478,0.4596,2.7864,3.5792,1.5481,0.8028,3.6774,4.6519,2.2763,0.4866,4.8114,0.1501,2.8218,4.0205,4.182,0.5444,2.29,2.9553,4.0229,0.7267,4.4883,0.9984,5.9838,1.7838,0.0548,1.8858,4.4136,1.6397,0.8919,7.1254,0.6989,1.0892,0.4812,6.5308,1.7519,5.6089,2.6056,1.4453,8.3695,0.0061,4.0389,2.5993,0.0049,0.0018,1.1877,0.8348,0.0002,4.1531,0.2259,0.0006,6.6222,1.5972,3.7205,4.9814,0.0063,3.4012,4.9778,0.3203,0.9762,0.5778,1.7658,2.4834,0.888,1.1439,4.57,2.6626,0.7681,3.4967,3.5371,2.0282,6.8872,1.8699,4.2237,3.1152,0.6744,6.3026,1.7267,1.866,5.732,0.2161,5.5928,0.6342,2.3115,0.0554,0.038,1.3202,4.3215,0.4982,2.7797,1.6902,2.0195,5.1287,7.1696,0.6002,1.0254,3.1226,3.4542,3.7585,3.2365,5.7224,0.8802,1.6735,2.6161,4.7549,0.2242,1.3013,4.5786,9.6174,0.0044,0.1861,5.0175,0.8881,0.9436,3.7742,1.1733,2.3432,0.0002,5.1753,3.6769,2.2455,5.1574,0.2006,0.7219,4.0015,3.2094,0.002,0.0009,2.1818,2.0618,1.3857,4.5086,2.1383,6.1983,1.2681,1.3626,8.0389,1.9971,0.5952,5.3854,0.317,0.2176,0.3777,0.9064,0.5581,0.8734,4.0788,0.0006,3.0614,1.1343,4.8084,0.0012,0.001,5.1845,0.2521,1.4136,1.0552,7.8479,0.0193,2.4246,1.4045,4.3386,0.3477]}
{"id":84,"ended":true,"length":350,"text":"Townsend's next project took several years to come to fruition. After the creation of the IR8 demo tape, Townsend and Jason Newsted had begun work on a new project called < unk'D >, which was to be a new band with a much more serious and darker, yet still catchy composition, and Townsend would play keyboards as well as guitars for the album. Although the first recordings of the new band did occur, due to a number of difficulties the project was not completed until the next year. Unfortunately, due to contractual obligations, Townsend could not make full use of the talents of Jason Newsted and instead of playing bass on the album Townsend played keyboards and played synth on the only track of the album ( \"Hurt Myself\") that had vocals in it because Jason was not available as guest to record those vocals.\n\nSince the completion of the IR8 demo, Townsend had turned his attention to a new project called the \"Kingdom of Soteria\", which would be more oriented toward experimental and alternative rock music, both Townsend and Newsted were heavily involved in the project, also collaborating with numerous musicians that included Steve Evetts from Dope, Dave Grohl (also of Nirvana) and John Frusciante (also of the Red Hot Chili Peppers). The Kingdom of Soteria was the next project that Townsend created as well as playing the lead guitar on their debut album as well. Because Townsend wanted to expand the use of keyboards Townsend turned to keyboardist and bassist Todd Pettengill who was able to use his experience playing many of the band's songs as a bassist for the Kingdom to produce both the album (as well as the demo) and the demo tape as well. In the beginning Townsend recorded the bass and synthesizer parts in a studio setup while Pettengill played the keyboard parts and recorded them on a drum machine.","token_len":382,"entropy":[11.4063,3.5312,6.6915,3.7807,7.9994,5.065,0.9992,0.5546,4.463,0.4858,0.1029,0.7031,4.3903,2.6337,5.9238,0.0275,1.1353,10.6157,7.4452,8.2518,5.974,0.856,10.413,2.5877,8.0414,8.3403,4.466,4.1831,4.8538,2.371,0.1254,1.4615,2.0316,2.8256,1.5454,10.0555,11.7317,5.6679,8.8695,6.305,7.3225,2.2541,0.8084,1.7804,2.2171,1.6886,1.7812,3.7637,5.418,3.0204,1.3813,3.7356,1.8136,5.1644,2.9727,5.4627,3.7619,3.7532,1.8826,5.3419,6.6765,3.069,2.3933,7.0253,3.3367,3.7577,5.5965,4.1793,0.7419,1.5649,4.8141,2.8133,0.8049,3.6649,0.332,4.9069,1.2806,3.4914,5.1379,0.9936,0.9763,2.1081,2.3969,3.6641,7.3459,1.852,7.2929,0.2166,2.4526,4.0466,0.0071,5.6123,4.0352,3.2127,0.8536,2.8004,2.1508,0.9116,2.0711,4.7403,0.5193,0.7589,5.8017,0.5721,4.4052,0.0054,7.6982,2.1365,1.0957,2.8773,4.2112,0.0694,3.4255,5.7193,0.9582,0.0072,0.9038,5.9098,0.4575,3.9849,0.7204,0.0007,1.4444,8.7954,5.3181,3.1243,3.2724,2.4476,0.548,0.8324,5.9374,3.7693,3.0201,2.278,3.8978,8.2954,2.2671,0.6513,8.3657,3.6944,1.9333,0.1208,0.3697,3.5771,3.7415,5.2905,4.645,5.5375,2.0101,3.2934,2.3681,2.8926,5.0329,3.684,0.4395,8.2122,3.1269,2.0263,2.0942,3.0016,4.0004,9.052,5.2856,3.2353,7.216,2.1001,0.4545,2.2055,0.0561,4.7536,1.4973,5.3821,0.0139,0.6263,3.4735,0.0745,0.2221,3.2904,1.2756,2.4602,5.8112,1.7125,0.3216,0.2607,3.3018,0.9048,1.0762,1.6111,3.522,3.5033,6.6153,3.0263,1.4221,5.8562,5.9898,4.4168,1.854,0.9313,1.2313,0.9739,4.7775,6.8803,1.6085,6.5193,2.0215,3.9631,1.3397,2.8238,2.2284,5.5505,14.3889,0.8264,1.413,0.002,2.5754,5.6539,0.2161,0.4609,2.0626,2.5253,1.5107,6.7593,6.0302,1.3663,6.5432,2.1991,4.9145,2.4349,5.0434,10.7046,5.0847,2.7129,4.5067,5.5153,4.9205,2.4019,4.5342,4.1231,0.0064,4.0895,4.7542,2.3909,5.1421,1.7568,0.194,4.1261,4.9387,0.6905,0.0229,0.0077,2.3227,2.0504,0.0743,3.0538,5.374,0.1971,0.0084,0.0005,0.0001,0.5561,1.834,3.0232,0.1922,0.0072,0.0007,0.0,1.0944,2.9724,4.4527,1.9251,1.9672,1.0716,6.2181,3.5131,1.4665,1.0033,4.6224,2.9915,3.1418,1.2405,0.9777,7.142,2.8779,0.361,5.1139,0.402,2.1187,6.1826,4.5938,3.5811,0.2854,5.0702,1.4148,6.0357,0.031,3.5036,9.2701,5.4948,0.1688,5.0676,1.9686,3.4514,2.0338,0.072,5.95,7.5782,5.1345,3.6225,0.2119,2.7855,1.8179,4.3196,0.008,4.1804,1.5574,2.9889,2.1316,6.5089,1.9166,0.2515,3.5755,0.1092,1.4744,2.5818,1.3324,2.922,0.1627,2.7377,0.6597,2.0471,7.4142,3.9202,5.567,1.7987,2.083,5.0118,4.3288,0.0819,0.0029,1.4296,2.6603,3.0968,0.0846,0.7224,2.1975,1.0146,4.0992,0.3307,0.6079,3.3139,1.7198,4.0881,2.6825,5.2117,1.4763,4.5953,2.9354,5.8191,0.1682,2.7374,3.3437,1.9784,2.2584,7.0213,3.6806,3.765,0.0017,0.0013,0.0017,2.564,1.0018,4.0715,3.145,2.614,3.1821,4.1489,1.7828,1.3515,4.4616,0.704,0.9567]}

{"id":489,"ended":true,"length":354,"text":"Bedell sponsored several bold initiatives during his tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents'problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage by the Port of Houston Authority. The port serves as a commercial port for international trade, including the export of chemicals, petroleum, crude oil and petroleum product. It receives much of the world's petroleum through the U.S. Gulf Coast. Although Houston has the largest oil refinery in America, the port has not been able to increase its share of the U.S. market for export of petroleum to Asia despite the development of new export facilities on the Gulf Coast. The growth of port facilities for export to Asia had left fewer barge transportation options available for U.S. producers and consumers of petroleum products. In 2003, Bedell wrote legislation making it possible for U.S. exporters to receive the full benefit of a \"port to port\" barge transportation system.\n\n\"The Port is the heart of our economy in North Houston and a major engine of our region's robust economic growth. I am pleased to have fought for the Port in my tenure in the House, and for our oil and gas community and industry that depend on it and for all the other workers who depend on this port for their livelihoods. The Port, and the jobs it brings in, mean better transportation options for all of us and more prosperity for Houston. I am pleased to see that efforts to improve the barge transit system are continuing under Mayor Parker and his mayoral administration.\"\n\nBedell worked to bring more transparency to the Port to improve the efficiency and accountability of operations. He was instrumental in the passage of the Port Authority Bill that established a new board for the port. The bill also provided for the establishment of an oversight mechanism to provide regular reports and make information about the Port available to the public.","token_len":382,"entropy":[8.6047,13.0336,5.8102,10.2113,2.3899,4.0158,1.093,1.5053,2.4415,0.7902,4.675,0.1161,2.5283,0.2616,0.0053,0.9197,3.529,5.0664,1.4201,2.9319,5.1885,2.8512,3.2899,7.1509,4.3993,15.316,3.1483,0.4936,1.4064,9.1666,4.4795,4.2997,0.3161,4.3445,0.1331,6.143,6.881,6.9914,3.6829,2.2058,5.2996,0.6751,4.6133,7.0569,0.9116,1.6658,4.0493,6.4983,1.9843,1.0267,5.6142,3.0459,1.7471,5.6612,2.348,1.3865,3.5234,2.3841,4.1917,0.0878,5.3532,1.5468,3.4614,1.7692,6.1242,0.1487,1.1607,3.6937,4.0701,0.8895,3.8088,5.6504,5.0584,0.0902,1.5114,4.074,0.0104,4.1955,5.2347,1.1652,4.7878,0.0011,0.0036,0.1527,0.9803,0.36,0.947,5.5253,4.2933,1.7433,3.5837,1.3329,3.6703,1.9076,0.532,4.4998,0.225,1.681,1.2172,1.8543,3.1477,1.2849,0.8516,0.0021,4.8029,0.7429,4.0192,0.1268,0.7495,2.1407,0.0003,0.0016,0.0466,2.3319,2.6924,6.0095,2.7493,1.7453,3.7735,3.0696,6.2745,1.8341,5.6913,0.0741,3.4014,4.1375,2.9928,4.4452,0.4973,0.674,0.2686,0.2461,2.128,7.7849,0.2998,4.6527,2.389,4.8646,2.5302,2.1304,0.3232,5.3258,6.7467,8.0447,6.7362,0.188,7.0747,1.9944,0.257,1.6131,3.8567,0.0004,0.0011,0.0496,4.8078,2.5824,3.6354,4.9865,1.6435,0.4488,0.7012,2.2929,4.2451,0.1614,11.1936,0.0178,5.2128,4.1998,4.6053,0.8304,4.168,0.2715,2.8998,0.0003,0.0016,0.0029,3.4323,0.0067,0.4156,5.9996,3.2539,3.6338,3.1475,0.0217,3.0011,4.8301,3.8584,5.1485,1.8287,0.4729,9.2171,0.0036,3.8182,2.4293,0.8295,2.5976,0.002,4.1423,1.7783,2.5698,5.2819,2.3432,5.8575,0.3816,1.7092,2.297,5.557,5.0365,7.0226,1.4193,4.1736,2.6673,5.1557,0.6834,1.3447,5.0647,0.1982,7.907,2.243,0.8319,1.4208,4.0943,1.5681,1.7753,0.6409,2.656,6.8617,1.4371,1.5615,1.2691,2.4772,2.209,3.8561,1.8307,0.5543,1.6388,2.4156,0.9192,4.0593,2.7652,6.0341,0.9083,0.3016,6.4566,3.0234,5.0895,4.9615,3.7374,0.1367,0.7931,4.9316,3.4432,3.8579,2.8869,3.9036,6.1464,1.4373,1.0867,0.102,3.0991,2.8954,1.7977,0.5531,1.0361,0.4911,1.4551,2.4339,0.8785,3.9836,2.7404,1.2354,6.7911,1.0359,2.9378,5.3144,0.7496,5.8132,6.1827,5.081,2.0045,0.5415,2.389,1.8012,1.0732,2.2007,3.1095,4.6668,0.2316,1.6826,3.5034,1.4472,1.6554,2.362,0.451,2.6743,1.5849,6.3224,1.1099,2.5149,0.9565,5.8722,0.0057,5.6588,0.3241,2.0437,4.1589,4.7041,3.9493,9.0667,1.3186,2.5843,9.4965,1.5005,1.6421,0.5579,0.0002,3.6743,0.0943,5.4535,1.8843,4.0587,3.4109,4.1521,0.6225,0.6042,1.9544,3.6682,2.7678,1.1554,4.4807,1.4876,4.2756,0.0809,5.9998,1.1874,1.4056,3.1408,1.6096,0.0173,2.0711,1.7713,0.0169,1.0362,1.86,6.0465,4.3997,4.3636,3.4978,1.7338,2.4112,4.6559,2.734,0.8153,2.4155,1.7809,1.6826,3.4706,2.0414,3.5042,1.1387,1.381,2.7733,0.0294,2.0913,3.712,5.2214,1.0763,4.3902,6.7369,2.5594,2.5687,5.7062,5.4653,3.3877,1.1876,1.9577,3.3179,0.2554,0.8049,0.4389,0.2349]}

He wanted to have a son through her, so that she could continue his legacy.\n\nIn 1914, Gandhi wrote in a letter : \"If I had not married three times, I certainly would not have attained the knowledge I have in the matter of non - non - @ violence and ahimsa.\"\n\n\"For me to write that I know the truth of non - @ - @ violence is like a man who is blind saying that he knows the truth of vision.\" - Mahatma Gandhi on the practice of non-violence\n\n\"There are no two words more dangerous than these in the language ; and the danger is not only to the man who utters them, but to the whole community too.\"","token_len":383,"entropy":[11.0365,0.6018,9.7764,3.3088,0.0039,5.7852,1.6248,1.3843,0.0476,0.2942,1.6173,7.641,0.163,1.7392,9.0181,4.659,0.1309,5.6829,16.3376,9.3957,7.6408,7.0741,2.3501,5.5549,2.2063,1.8684,1.1092,10.0665,2.6651,6.6321,11.5999,8.9154,4.4645,6.2307,1.0948,3.1556,4.596,2.1663,3.6354,1.4012,6.4311,0.0028,8.0656,2.0669,5.282,5.9122,1.7505,5.0076,6.2828,6.8791,1.386,0.0322,4.2525,3.3039,1.8143,4.5864,0.561,3.9981,1.6863,3.6662,6.2005,0.0873,6.2755,7.6772,2.9456,6.5436,3.1314,3.4301,4.2601,2.1153,1.7266,2.3109,4.5538,1.3564,5.4983,2.3826,3.8561,4.0115,1.6646,0.9251,9.2039,0.5464,0.0161,1.1179,1.9431,0.0726,3.904,0.015,0.0247,4.66,0.4167,3.0645,1.8924,5.1066,2.4254,0.4578,6.4484,5.3659,1.4672,0.61,3.5238,4.0383,1.0564,0.8146,6.1314,1.2715,0.0195,0.5397,4.3716,0.0014,4.4215,0.2614,2.8663,0.611,2.8602,1.7234,6.0377,7.1104,0.7989,0.3564,4.2948,4.0983,3.5213,4.3558,2.3704,7.8821,0.2226,4.2308,1.4445,0.4537,0.2669,4.5543,4.527,3.6409,0.5696,2.6446,2.8436,1.665,5.7479,5.6604,1.0974,0.1716,2.2676,0.3972,0.0035,4.6061,3.3704,0.7539,1.3628,0.0002,2.5733,0.0198,0.0044,3.1027,7.4719,2.5462,4.0938,0.9995,6.9249,2.4927,1.8963,4.1422,5.8155,0.9791,4.8456,1.6266,6.144,5.5781,1.4902,5.9779,4.1218,1.0593,5.8171,0.5825,0.2642,0.1738,2.49,9.2618,2.3155,6.6495,4.7552,4.6504,5.5521,4.4097,7.533,1.7693,1.0931,2.1638,1.6123,2.0361,2.9617,1.8194,5.2742,4.3987,1.7628,7.836,2.1707,4.7586,4.4589,2.6829,2.4355,2.0927,0.049,7.7287,4.1434,4.3157,14.9179,2.9832,1.9084,1.3854,0.3062,0.3364,4.0835,0.8286,4.4524,2.4505,1.2038,5.6797,4.3034,1.8678,4.8909,2.2821,2.4168,3.0326,3.0069,0.011,8.3105,5.1211,10.9866,2.9,2.5627,1.7241,3.0392,5.2637,0.0164,0.8606,3.1435,5.8016,0.5204,3.1034,1.4913,3.0606,5.5406,2.0149,1.7913,3.0683,2.1459,2.0268,0.6017,3.7369,2.1808,3.6556,1.1648,0.631,0.0002,2.9393,7.6712,0.347,1.9156,3.9547,3.4347,2.2187,0.3902,5.4594,0.2202,4.5161,1.4299,1.9571,2.027,3.6713,7.669,1.535,1.102,0.8459,5.1446,0.2847,0.4348,0.1819,4.373,1.3355,5.6668,2.69,1.7642,3.9301,2.0496,4.772,0.2725,1.5173,3.0854,6.5762,2.8013,2.578,5.3415,2.043,7.3246,0.0016,0.0061,1.3332,0.9477,0.0002,4.2348,5.1206,2.5174,3.4965,5.0734,2.6687,1.7187,4.4489,2.7707,3.0345,1.8805,1.2155,0.8306,3.6334,4.77,1.6338,1.993,1.9545,2.5334,2.6138,5.312,1.2273,2.4239,4.7214,8.0315,1.745,0.925,1.7487,1.3332,0.3492,0.605,10.6312,2.7458,2.5422,3.461,0.0885,0.0063,0.0109,4.3483,2.3251,5.2386,0.0836,0.5455,1.2777,1.4413,0.8901,0.0001,3.4467,3.825,1.5248,3.2977,4.4728,5.5388,3.612,4.7964,0.8755,5.9901,6.4987,1.4299,2.9031,10.5273,3.3166,2.8267,5.7433,1.3389,2.3917,2.903,3.0314,1.6095,3.8595,1.2179,5.87,0.0219,1.1097,0.828,0.2241,0.8274,0.904,2.2744,2.4552,5.3955,0.9435]}

(Even in the midst of \"A Woman of No Importance\", Wilde describes the character of the Marquise de Merteuil as \"slightly French, slightly English.\" )\n\nThis novel is the one to which Wilde is best remembered, and one of the first to appear after he was released from debtor's prison and had left Great Britain. The book's plot centers on the relationship between a young woman named Rosemary, who aspires to be an actress, and Lord Alfred Douglas, a man who is married to someone else but who is in love with Rosemary. Rosemary's marriage to Lord Alfred is more an act of kindness and generosity than a real marriage, which may have been more than Rosemary herself realized.\n\nIn \"Lady Windermere's Fan\", Oscar, or Lord Windermere, goes to England to visit his brother Percy and is shocked by how he has been treated. He asks his brother to treat them the way that he thinks a real Englishman should treat his guests. Percy reluctantly agrees, but before he leaves for England, he decides to write a letter to Rosemary explaining what has happened to his brother. He does this hoping that she will think that he needs her help and return to London to see him.\n\nThey met in a fashionable ball-room. There was no need for introductions. They looked at each other, each with a flash of recognition.

{"id":1988,"ended":true,"length":347,"text":"Aerial operations for the incursion got off to a slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the P-38 was to establish visual identification of the enemy forces to be attacked, or to reconnoiter the objectives of the approaching forces. This sortie had achieved the first of these objectives since the incursion began. At 1400 local time (1200 GMT), the American bomber attacked a target within the coastal plain. It was observed that there was a large body of ground units north of the target, but because the Japanese aircraft were maneuvering and not stationary, MACV felt it prudent to send a force of P-38s to verify the identity of the approaching enemy forces and the degree of their danger. The aircrews first attacked a position to be overrun on the eastern edge of the coastal plain with their.50-caliber machine guns firing. They also opened fire with their 20mm guns at the targets that were in their visual range. In turn, the Japanese aircraft directed their fire against the bombers but there was no appreciable effect on the attacks. At 1445, the first P-38, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel W. W.

It replaced the US Army Air Force (USAAAF) and replaced almost all combat units of the Army Air Forces except for those that were assigned to the combat forces of the United States Army Forces (United States Army General Forces or Army Ground Forces), in which the services remained as permanent units. In the wake of World War II, the Army Air Forces also assumed most of the air defense function of the Army.","token_len":383,"entropy":[11.9517,9.3263,3.8071,1.774,9.9367,0.6351,8.5359,3.9445,0.0338,0.0768,1.6177,0.0069,1.3692,8.7839,1.1168,4.3909,3.7648,0.9804,10.3747,1.688,1.6042,5.4477,6.4883,11.3785,4.7065,9.2262,1.9774,2.7761,3.1244,7.2447,0.6464,0.977,6.0893,4.2984,5.8967,1.5279,2.22,9.2417,0.1621,0.9176,6.1038,1.756,2.2153,1.9762,1.1211,5.5874,7.1275,6.433,1.0142,1.6053,2.3029,3.8933,4.4901,2.0762,4.3587,2.2855,4.7143,1.5231,6.7822,0.5418,0.1332,1.6573,5.1853,1.5347,0.5826,6.7155,2.0721,0.5729,3.4443,6.4603,7.4478,3.6062,7.0102,2.3225,4.4437,2.4071,3.681,0.3716,5.7025,0.9409,7.5305,0.0773,1.7057,1.272,4.4879,8.3908,5.009,0.2732,2.1399,4.014,0.7784,0.6719,0.9404,5.5409,5.47,5.4278,2.5681,3.1206,4.6979,1.5759,7.1239,3.9579,1.9175,2.9979,0.7393,5.791,0.7246,3.5511,0.8402,1.2602,2.6985,4.705,0.0515,3.4997,7.1734,6.7887,0.1223,0.3613,2.1105,1.4699,2.2372,6.3798,1.6809,5.315,3.2825,0.8994,6.6074,0.0063,3.7614,2.863,6.2567,0.4678,7.3795,0.0206,6.1927,1.9778,2.9014,0.1029,4.0012,1.5529,5.6394,2.1118,4.332,0.0287,0.0654,0.9746,1.1294,7.6326,1.0666,4.2403,0.0662,0.2581,5.4469,2.2024,0.5818,2.8687,3.2725,7.9254,0.2217,2.7792,6.1191,0.2801,1.5364,5.1681,3.0088,2.9566,7.992,5.6792,2.0525,3.0631,4.569,2.949,6.2382,3.9417,0.6738,3.9848,2.5008,0.0329,0.0988,3.4267,0.2032,3.7235,3.15,11.0706,10.0088,2.5833,5.5455,1.4742,0.2178,5.952,2.9042,2.7018,3.1447,5.28,0.0713,3.2528,1.177,6.0773,1.0063,3.3691,2.6219,1.0805,3.9622,4.4542,0.9308,3.2092,3.3097,7.76,1.6577,0.3723,4.1623,5.0134,0.2051,1.0793,1.9913,1.8757,5.4366,0.9141,2.2465,3.5566,0.5473,7.8446,5.6708,4.5026,0.5701,0.4445,5.9022,0.0051,2.9082,0.934,0.3842,6.0304,0.4972,3.9201,4.4434,4.0656,2.2571,0.9377,3.7957,1.9574,0.0049,0.0246,5.0737,5.0304,0.0008,0.0188,3.0055,1.8165,5.0459,0.3908,3.1714,0.0535,4.6253,3.5663,2.6445,0.4012,0.3241,1.6191,2.9388,0.0136,2.7619,2.1066,5.6536,5.3706,5.4066,0.2067,0.7488,5.5755,0.0041,8.1785,0.4306,3.0505,0.0094,6.2662,6.1057,0.0002,1.7788,4.7866,2.8731,2.6988,1.5726,2.9465,5.5842,7.7033,0.0623,5.3486,7.1778,1.4854,0.0516,2.4525,0.0195,1.5286,0.5343,2.0342,1.8835,0.6273,4.1793,2.0913,1.0651,1.9448,6.5594,0.2105,3.1943,1.2663,0.9866,1.2036,3.3272,2.337,2.5151,7.7417,0.3894,2.6494,3.4773,9.1737,0.3731,5.2507,3.2824,2.3101,0.1911,2.3532,1.69,1.229,6.8938,1.1895,3.7633,2.5781,0.9505,2.631,0.3438,0.9441,6.7058,3.2164,1.3299,0.2919,1.8795,0.0233,1.1472,8.2847,2.7,5.922,0.019,0.9882,7.5592,3.6817,4.9602,3.8725,4.1016,0.1252,2.8147,3.625,1.7017,3.479,6.2774,4.2429,3.505,6.0105,3.7506,0.6753,3.1846,2.4555,5.46,0.0006,2.2001,0.0012,0.0684,0.2465,0.5073,1.8709,0.9273,0.414,4.9356,5.0115,5.3724,0.3062,1.1696,4.502,3.6505,5.6278,1.2825,0.2297,1.3841,1.6371]}
{"id":4957,"ended":true,"length":347,"text":"In 1975, construction began on a westward extension of the Brantford Bypass, from Highway 2 ( Paris Road ) to Rest Acres Road, which would become Highway 24. This work consisted of the replacement of the existing bridge, south of Elgin, and three new bridges over the Grand River at the community of Rest Acres, Waverley and Grand River ( the bridge is now designated \"Rest Acres (Grand River) Bridge \"). The bridge was opened to traffic on July 1, 1978, and was one of the last projects to be completed on the original north-south alignment of Highway 24 and the new Highway 24 westward extension. In 1988, the two-lane expressway was completed through the western part of Brantford. The last remaining section through the city was built as a four-lane arterial highway in 2003. The project was a combined public-private partnership. Most of the structures were built using the \"bridging-in-place\" method, with the existing roadway replaced with a concrete or precast structure that was mounted on vertical steel columns in place of the existing roadbed.\n\nThe original bridge was a small steel bridge built in 1926 that included a central pier and approaches that were placed in concrete pads constructed over the river. The concrete support pier ( which rests on the bedrock ) was built using a poured-pavement method, and the bridge deck was supported by six large concrete piers. On the western side, the north approach ( on the ground ) was approximately 190 m ( 650 ft ) west of the existing bridge and the south approach ( on top of the existing bridge deck on the second span ) was located approximately 150 m ( 480 ft ) west from the existing bridge. In the spring and early summer of 2004, the old structure was demolished and removed. All of the steel and most of the concrete piers remained in place.","token_len":383,"entropy":[10.1331,0.259,9.4324,1.7061,0.4686,1.3868,8.146,3.5221,3.4729,0.2192,0.5634,7.9826,3.9497,0.8037,8.5006,0.2833,1.5534,5.2667,5.9417,3.8163,4.0125,17.4363,4.8544,0.8348,0.3338,10.0955,10.8317,0.0672,2.5447,2.0711,2.2363,1.2611,2.5898,4.377,4.9349,0.8536,2.9773,5.7048,5.0612,0.1252,2.4288,4.6443,0.0446,1.0008,2.8162,3.3217,2.6814,5.9298,1.1867,7.2081,1.4882,2.3977,1.5326,6.2089,1.2838,1.3216,2.8763,0.6148,5.7842,1.5158,4.2877,1.5258,9.2583,2.1544,3.614,0.5108,0.0003,1.754,7.9805,3.3512,0.3776,2.7644,5.6721,2.7407,3.9127,5.3889,3.8434,3.5093,1.4667,5.8422,3.7044,2.8699,0.6404,0.0018,6.7938,5.6165,0.8563,0.9932,1.6292,1.6434,1.1749,1.3182,2.4958,1.0336,4.7872,1.5143,0.864,1.115,2.5483,1.8697,0.0732,2.7766,1.0741,0.7211,2.1584,5.3888,0.0245,0.6096,3.0764,5.1776,1.6981,1.2037,0.6593,1.928,0.6234,5.7046,4.9603,1.0373,0.2722,3.2005,0.6876,2.882,0.5426,3.6952,1.1986,3.2176,5.134,0.686,3.9048,0.988,0.8544,1.0763,3.1196,4.0858,0.1638,0.7499,5.5005,3.0437,0.6355,4.0071,0.3629,1.2575,2.0154,5.9186,1.0181,6.3736,2.0725,0.0115,5.7195,0.0097,0.0021,1.6954,1.3667,6.027,3.5393,3.7372,7.6868,0.9948,3.36,1.2889,2.7757,4.0687,1.3982,4.5132,0.2432,0.0703,5.9158,0.0039,2.768,2.7497,4.9811,0.542,1.5507,3.3507,1.1967,4.5146,5.287,5.6028,1.5508,0.042,0.4858,2.9707,6.8542,0.3297,0.0752,7.1298,1.7372,2.6225,3.6207,2.0759,5.6594,6.5462,1.9059,5.2156,4.0949,1.4367,1.6378,0.0842,2.2527,1.3255,2.6128,1.0706,4.8546,4.1228,3.6426,0.9422,0.7339,4.7231,4.8443,7.7949,1.5528,3.7707,2.7384,1.3482,5.8251,0.9265,8.0756,4.567,3.4606,3.7696,3.5162,0.0643,1.0667,0.734,3.6549,5.1156,0.4699,2.2963,0.0064,1.5993,3.7465,3.3946,1.1931,3.4477,5.3008,4.6996,2.2239,3.3528,1.0314,4.617,3.15,5.1816,0.9823,4.6337,7.5093,1.6084,11.6196,4.2855,1.1896,4.9618,2.1837,5.9756,8.237,7.6526,3.3148,0.7248,5.7078,1.341,0.852,3.8881,7.4765,4.7484,4.277,5.9621,8.8073,1.072,1.034,6.5343,2.7737,0.6888,3.3757,4.4067,1.6178,10.0447,1.7561,5.1404,2.8531,3.98,1.557,1.8843,1.0434,3.5631,4.753,0.6267,5.0043,0.5947,5.0046,3.5266,1.336,3.8309,0.1155,1.1726,4.8017,0.8649,4.154,0.5301,2.9177,1.0386,4.1355,7.3984,3.535,4.7645,0.6889,6.0761,1.4057,0.584,7.0073,7.771,4.1448,1.6626,8.397,0.1101,1.3898,5.7564,0.5794,0.2686,3.2719,0.9158,2.6898,2.2984,0.527,0.4536,0.7752,0.6299,6.039,0.1598,0.2012,1.871,0.3721,3.9852,5.7234,0.5961,6.6653,8.0537,0.3114,0.4463,6.3717,1.5336,3.1436,0.0445,0.0826,5.0187,0.0023,0.2367,1.3244,4.3974,0.0784,1.2889,0.1343,0.6925,3.3444,1.8532,4.0903,3.1117,3.8289,0.1886,0.2788,4.3244,0.1435,0.8146,5.2617,5.0699,0.3518,2.2375,1.3033,5.9895,1.853,5.0025,1.2189,0.0529,6.1276,2.7434,8.3768,0.0395,0.0175,0.5724,4.9479,0.0137,4.7167,1.4338,0.0995,0.9872]}

Evans took charge on 5 October 2009, following the resignation of Mark Lillis. Evans, who had signed Cooksey, while boss at York City, also kept him out of the side when he took charge at York four years later. Cooksey scored 12 goals in his first season with the club. In his second season, he scored 8 times, helping the team win the FA Trophy.\n\nHe started the 2009\u201310 season poorly, and was sent off early in the 4\u20131 home loss to Portsmouth. One man who Cooksey admitted that he had a grudge against was Pompey player Andy Cannon, as he had earlier described Cannon as one of his \"favourite ever\" players. The striker was a regular in the side in the first half of the season and was among the top half-dozen goalscorers in League Two. He was also awarded the club's player-of-the-month prize for October 2009. He ended the season with 10 goals in all competitions, which included a hat-trick in his team's 4\u20131 win over Tranmere Rovers.

{"id":363,"ended":true,"length":335,"text":"Pennsylvania's streams have frequently flooded. According to William H. Shank, the Native Americans of Pennsylvania warned white settlers that great floods occurred on the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers every 14 years. The streams were covered with a \"black sludge.\" In a letter to the Pennsylvania Historical Society, written about 1710, Indians wrote: \"In short, there are seven years of great floods... and the Indians were of opinion that the Indians had seen the Delaware rise above the great tree which they call 'Foostock' (Elms, Quercus virginiana).... The Delaware has, above this and all other places, a black sludge which flows up into it. This also happens on the Susquehanna, but the Indians have had the bad luck not to see it.\" The \"Foostock\" alluded to was one of the names of the falls of the Delaware River.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, more than 90 feet of soil were washed away by floods that lasted 30 days or more. In 1854, the Delaware River flooded in August, September and October and killed 2,000 to 12,000 people. During a period of only seven years, some 150,000 Pennsylvanians suffered losses, including $30 million in agricultural and livestock losses. Between 1847 and 1851, the Great Flood of 1861 killed approximately 5,000 people. In 1849, the Susquehanna River flooded so extensively that many areas were under a mile of water and the entire city of Harrisburg was inundated. During the flood, which followed severe rains, the Pennsylvania Historical Society recorded that the river rose from 100 to 150 feet in nine hours. Flooding also threatened cities in other southern states. In the early 1850s, severe rainstorms caused devastating floods on the Ohio River, and in eastern Louisiana, many river villages were destroyed.","token_len":383,"entropy":[9.6618,2.7732,12.913,3.2648,7.6418,5.06,2.4972,4.7942,0.0016,7.783,3.374,0.4517,10.9394,1.6387,2.358,10.0451,4.1703,1.5534,2.1999,7.653,8.1601,1.0613,0.9923,8.9801,2.2434,5.673,3.3206,1.2677,4.8001,2.8058,5.6973,0.0001,0.0003,0.0083,0.5196,5.0449,7.5803,0.9551,0.7096,2.4901,5.2768,1.7296,4.9656,0.6647,2.8979,4.3119,4.0587,5.2808,0.4716,2.2543,3.0659,3.9955,2.6319,0.549,1.3254,2.8768,2.411,0.1445,0.5293,6.2902,4.4334,3.1091,4.775,0.1768,7.0404,2.608,1.7636,0.4296,3.7776,5.7768,0.3252,2.7795,1.487,5.5185,3.9499,0.9787,3.454,1.1286,6.5907,3.5388,2.2494,4.3852,5.3929,5.2472,2.8944,0.2653,1.432,3.7478,2.6463,4.5737,1.804,5.8026,6.545,4.3055,0.4952,6.013,8.9783,3.6115,2.3188,3.7412,3.2383,5.6614,5.1254,6.3404,6.184,2.9921,2.7727,7.8914,4.6203,3.7854,8.0306,4.0126,0.033,7.5385,1.7429,1.8561,3.7632,2.4078,3.66,3.0081,4.5184,5.9954,5.6661,6.1538,3.4351,1.2677,3.1472,0.5385,2.433,3.3941,0.3272,0.0257,2.0367,4.5107,3.2579,2.9945,3.4301,2.3459,2.9287,6.2505,2.5249,2.2766,0.5281,1.8935,0.006,0.008,0.0065,1.5701,3.8265,2.4948,1.0318,2.3021,4.747,2.8869,5.5093,0.6373,4.3717,0.3823,1.3213,0.8657,1.6153,2.3397,4.6891,1.725,0.0267,0.002,0.0053,0.1206,9.2646,0.0614,2.5941,3.9632,0.1581,0.4383,5.9872,0.9708,1.0021,8.5241,1.9955,0.6585,2.5197,1.5677,1.1905,2.0034,0.0048,5.1442,1.3599,3.132,0.2282,2.1452,0.183,0.0141,0.2745,4.6725,0.3463,4.8349,5.649,0.2706,5.9456,3.0685,3.7215,2.011,1.3589,3.3685,3.7192,4.855,5.6634,1.6921,1.8425,0.1612,0.4083,2.3128,2.3369,4.1917,0.2557,1.6421,3.3042,0.8528,3.4018,3.2717,7.836,1.8325,7.202,1.2251,0.1065,3.2189,3.6925,4.3424,0.0637,1.9315,4.4794,5.8063,0.0049,0.0508,0.4789,0.4355,4.5608,3.8007,3.416,0.2802,5.0567,3.9179,1.2033,0.3028,5.0764,4.5564,0.6634,0.002,8.0195,0.0044,0.4628,0.0011,3.8923,4.5675,2.362,2.3524,6.4129,4.0437,0.4529,0.7497,5.5106,3.6721,4.7427,0.2365,0.5888,5.0927,1.0933,4.2221,0.0438,0.8486,2.9607,0.1382,1.2594,5.1847,1.6603,1.4527,4.9536,2.4661,5.2465,3.2782,0.3149,0.7232,0.456,0.958,2.2154,1.2877,4.8805,0.1183,1.2381,5.4339,0.0097,0.0029,0.005,0.8708,1.6634,7.6334,5.6089,0.2674,4.3875,6.1017,1.4531,4.6973,3.3281,4.6856,0.5903,1.7696,2.6089,2.9659,4.2569,3.965,1.1901,4.9272,0.1175,0.7497,2.3405,0.0008,0.5415,4.3175,0.6862,3.4456,0.635,5.131,4.9535,6.1038,3.4188,1.2428,1.8309,3.1316,2.4892,0.0134,4.1266,1.6036,2.1436,2.9984,4.3561,2.3972,4.8601,1.8045,2.8656,0.0226,1.5599,6.0261,2.3279,0.6454,5.1992,1.325,2.9709,5.6172,6.0166,2.3018,4.892,5.3525,0.4399,1.2458,1.4599,2.7157,2.9487,3.941,0.1729,0.079,7.2381,4.6881,4.0156,2.4883,5.8679,1.8039,3.391,1.1359,3.5242,0.6995,1.557,3.6523,1.6081,8.3756,6.1247,0.74,5.3215,6.8661,5.0648,0.6005,1.7945,0.6491]}
{"id":906,"ended":true,"length":358,"text":"Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close @ - @ knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar mitzvah. As he turned 13, he stopped going to synagogue -- \"I thought I didn't need it,\" he later said -- and drifted away from religion entirely, later telling Rolling Stone it \"wasn't something I was really interested in.\".\n\nThough he occasionally attended the synagogue during the summer, and sometimes stayed in touch, the young singer never became very involved in his community, despite having the great-great grandfather of Jewish - Swedish entrepreneur Fred Karmel.\n\nDylan had said before that he got his sense of music from the Bible and folk. In an interview for Rolling Stone, he said, \" 'Folk music has become a kind of a religion unto itself with many devout believers.... And the music always reflects more than the simple truth or falsehood of something, and that is very often the source of where that thing lies.' \"\n\nIn August 1962, he went to San Francisco with Ginsberg and fellow poetry writer Michael McClure and joined the Beat movement, taking the name Bob Dylan. Dylan and the group, dubbed the Band, recorded what would become one of their signature songs, \"The Water is Wide\" in February of 1963.\n\nThe Band were originally going to release the song, although Dylan told Jann Wenner that he wanted to release it as an \"artistic statement\", not necessarily as a song. Later, he said that he \"regretted the way I handled that.\" When asked in an interview in 2003 by the band's former mandolin player Levon Helm about the song, Dylan said, \"It was too much of a statement, you know. It was me thinking too much.\" The song was left unreleased until 1994.","token_len":383,"entropy":[5.9479,1.0347,10.6197,1.2305,0.4569,5.5178,0.1819,6.9815,3.1301,1.8308,2.0316,1.9467,5.2567,0.0845,1.0454,6.5512,0.0975,4.4658,2.5861,6.8487,15.4049,10.3975,6.2401,10.4316,10.0729,0.4362,3.0434,2.282,4.3779,5.6071,7.7641,3.3427,4.4106,1.4772,9.6334,2.8134,0.0005,0.0282,0.0459,2.1349,4.0817,2.2368,4.5865,4.2441,0.6724,0.7705,6.5929,3.0801,0.1581,1.1143,6.7597,4.0145,2.0518,3.7786,1.4483,5.3888,0.0003,1.9113,2.3919,1.3444,0.3794,2.9123,1.6333,0.9572,0.4536,7.1663,1.7411,1.1513,6.2444,5.9167,2.5554,6.7653,2.4492,5.3817,0.0102,6.5596,2.8755,1.265,2.6386,0.001,3.6413,0.4791,2.6647,3.0003,1.1357,0.0059,0.7762,9.7284,1.6816,0.0011,5.1746,1.5282,6.6873,2.7835,2.3289,1.8064,4.6441,1.5498,1.6653,0.6358,4.2867,3.7289,3.7877,2.0717,5.9218,3.4427,3.604,3.924,3.7329,2.9322,4.2426,4.6192,1.8601,0.7333,1.9889,2.9179,1.7959,4.0113,2.9217,4.2029,5.3246,4.5323,1.7668,5.4314,1.6443,7.2345,10.8436,10.3646,7.5093,3.9285,4.9865,6.2465,1.5579,2.0163,1.7877,0.0004,2.7652,0.0008,3.6023,6.0829,4.7024,1.4251,0.6125,6.2368,2.3173,6.9963,0.1259,3.1801,0.7703,2.1493,6.0216,2.8131,7.0306,4.0854,3.1962,3.5976,0.3866,3.2013,1.0269,0.0073,0.7462,0.8662,0.9981,1.6606,0.073,9.9295,6.5016,2.5327,1.2285,3.278,3.8344,1.8547,3.2092,0.0018,3.9987,2.8419,5.8949,0.2986,6.0829,4.9634,8.5427,3.799,6.6861,4.5818,2.906,3.3592,6.9695,6.0551,6.8155,2.2784,1.429,5.7506,4.083,4.0093,8.0167,1.1078,5.0149,2.4149,2.2023,2.5974,1.5026,4.3842,4.454,1.365,4.7274,0.1501,7.0087,3.8392,4.8019,4.7054,1.7335,0.7827,0.3961,0.0003,2.6841,5.5665,3.8374,0.2188,2.4564,3.8332,0.5949,6.0696,0.229,3.4561,10.6356,0.4579,1.5264,5.0207,10.0265,2.3988,4.6657,8.343,1.5447,2.7382,5.139,1.5269,7.1854,7.179,1.7017,5.0199,2.2738,1.83,5.8163,0.3678,0.6773,3.4265,3.934,3.4959,2.7657,3.5934,4.9434,0.7702,6.4272,1.3043,5.3853,5.4431,1.8664,0.2424,3.1285,0.0051,2.6145,4.4643,0.4811,0.5701,0.4906,2.6429,6.4098,4.6056,7.8021,2.3315,1.3685,5.0934,4.0707,1.2046,0.3943,1.0002,0.0003,2.4965,4.9353,4.3599,5.353,4.3887,0.078,2.3343,2.2291,2.1145,1.9468,5.8667,3.1211,3.9285,7.3714,4.0392,0.9515,0.2129,2.0002,1.1028,2.2902,0.625,3.3197,0.9569,2.0797,2.1939,3.717,4.1476,2.8749,2.0782,4.941,3.525,4.8697,1.6323,0.394,2.0223,0.9486,5.6694,0.4937,1.5111,1.5584,2.1422,0.7384,3.5392,8.3446,2.0159,0.0773,2.1581,4.1087,1.8938,4.0357,3.3077,2.7103,5.1399,1.0656,4.4806,1.4513,0.1142,3.5269,4.1314,3.2192,3.07,6.7709,0.5121,4.4624,14.4746,0.4978,1.8468,10.2632,3.4843,4.5851,2.2874,1.2996,1.4705,0.6813,1.0104,0.7298,0.6498,0.031,2.0848,0.8535,4.6304,2.4621,1.4471,0.2936,3.527,1.8449,4.8262,0.044,1.7943,1.3762,0.6055,6.8538,4.9442,4.0289,0.2493,2.3233,4.4136,1.6309,1.4872,7.8582,6.633,0.0239,2.0967,4.8019,1.2662]}
{"id":913,"ended":true,"length":349,"text":"For a city situated so near the equator, Mogadishu has a relatively dry climate. It is classified as hot and semi @ - @ arid ( K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh ), as opposed to the drier, hotter summer climate. The area receives much less precipitation than the average for a large city, usually averaging 0.06 inches (1.7 cm) of rainfall each year. This is still quite a bit of rainfall, considering the average across the equator runs from 8.6 inches (222.6 cm ) to 8.2 inches (210.4 cm), but Mogadishu receives much less rainfall on average than many other large cities in the region.\n\nSo the air is dry but relatively cool, that cool dry air also has a tendency to be stagnant as well, as stagnant as it can be in a city at the equator with daily sunlight hours in the mid to high hours of the day.\n\nThat said, I don't think the climate is as dry and arid as many have tried to say it is. Sure, in the months of June through September we do get a lot less rainfall than other cities, or even other seasons of the year. Then there is the weather. There is always the wind.\n\nSo what we see when you are watching TV is a breeze, but what we really need to worry about is that wind.\n\nAt the speed at which these winds go, they will bring in those stale air and bring in that moisture from the open ocean. I have read that when the wind is blowing north to south, it will pick up the moisture from the ocean and bring it in over a larger area.\n\nHow bad this will get is hard to say. But as these winds have been in the offing this year, I decided it was too soon to say if anything major will happen.","token_len":384,"entropy":[3.1925,7.1502,8.6154,4.7664,3.9304,1.2066,3.9927,0.0058,0.6126,12.8407,1.6394,0.0022,2.5621,1.864,4.403,6.3153,0.3751,1.2515,3.2631,1.0672,7.9284,0.231,7.3373,1.8614,8.2502,14.9633,6.2808,6.5592,7.0766,1.7592,4.2793,11.3141,6.8624,4.6756,2.4312,9.1141,6.751,8.2529,10.9901,3.7303,4.4076,3.7268,0.0018,2.4038,5.4322,1.0975,2.9186,4.9622,6.0885,3.1114,2.4094,2.1028,4.8054,6.7548,4.1231,1.5443,1.8358,0.9712,1.8214,4.0051,4.6986,3.0353,3.5547,0.7654,1.7804,6.6543,7.0429,3.2602,0.1497,5.2573,2.504,2.8082,2.9794,0.6295,3.1036,0.9499,0.5984,3.5119,2.4022,3.4638,0.3022,0.3731,3.4132,1.3315,6.1293,3.9769,1.3559,1.8937,1.6682,1.9859,1.2851,5.6987,1.3737,3.5809,8.7433,0.7902,7.5039,0.27,7.1211,0.8983,4.3844,0.9173,2.4489,0.349,0.398,10.2012,2.3563,2.3224,0.3839,7.2284,1.5536,3.4175,0.0553,3.0173,0.0582,0.0018,5.8259,0.1002,2.2026,0.0113,2.2584,2.1952,2.9153,0.0014,0.0032,3.4749,3.5048,0.401,1.566,5.0221,0.2452,0.7593,3.1257,1.1196,3.1107,0.2281,1.2819,0.5334,1.8287,0.3348,1.2509,0.2574,5.8429,3.5515,7.8794,2.404,4.6981,4.0415,6.4574,2.9113,1.331,6.0256,7.7804,9.7341,0.5489,5.6177,3.0897,1.1113,2.2394,0.109,3.8628,7.3376,4.0152,2.7644,1.7627,2.6483,8.3096,6.588,2.8344,2.3312,0.6577,2.139,2.7234,1.7622,4.4256,1.9191,1.4909,0.0161,4.8344,8.2486,7.2715,6.4117,3.5756,0.8904,4.8141,1.5789,2.8708,7.6195,1.1935,0.2273,0.5214,0.359,2.0398,0.0002,5.7065,2.7065,0.0461,5.124,3.1815,0.0009,0.7124,2.3842,3.6375,1.503,2.5894,4.3141,2.7823,6.5654,0.0029,0.2166,2.7672,4.6574,5.8508,0.0969,2.6543,2.0769,0.2332,0.6464,6.6871,0.1999,4.5626,1.8935,6.3112,0.7979,2.9831,2.5097,1.0157,3.8732,5.095,0.9946,1.744,1.8502,4.9027,2.6093,1.4759,3.5043,0.8815,1.0756,6.6177,1.5104,5.2275,6.1915,3.1772,0.2414,0.0753,1.2328,7.153,2.0739,1.018,0.4875,3.2273,1.9162,3.569,0.765,3.6591,1.5881,4.2902,1.6733,2.8324,0.0002,2.788,2.3605,4.2787,2.6981,3.0954,2.1729,3.4233,3.7936,4.9264,1.6834,1.8224,6.6585,1.7512,2.7899,3.5693,1.1302,3.6207,3.5735,1.0373,5.2978,0.0108,0.238,3.6116,3.4152,1.4757,2.0752,0.0002,5.4679,1.3142,7.4605,5.2078,0.0047,5.5323,2.9607,5.5864,1.1908,1.5001,3.3097,4.3814,3.317,7.6513,9.385,2.0596,2.5841,4.4959,0.7811,3.5347,3.793,3.5003,0.4102,7.199,3.2513,0.8478,4.6911,2.3788,5.0426,0.7696,3.5933,1.5427,1.0855,1.4395,1.6102,5.8905,4.0316,0.5374,0.7667,1.305,1.024,4.9987,0.0321,2.0852,0.9151,1.5679,0.218,2.2712,0.9855,1.5628,0.6275,2.6973,5.537,2.5667,4.7677,0.1086,1.0346,1.9596,0.0002,5.0248,5.9145,3.4592,2.3433,1.6134,1.0285,3.7888,0.0081,1.3932,1.197,2.733,3.5039,5.9808,1.4083,5.0363,2.4508,4.4391,1.0064,7.8982,0.5948,5.7185,2.3094,0.3993,1.9178,7.3157,3.2622,0.6431,5.4049,5.16,0.1355,1.8501,3.085,4.2037,7.0146,2.7686,0.7857,0.9701]}

It later received a rating of 6.4 on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIn \"A New Way to Die\", after an encounter with the gangsters hired by The Shadow, Sam has a dream in which he learns that he is the killer and is chased by a man who knows Sam's secret and that Sam will die if he does not turn himself in. Sam is then shown to be in an asylum somewhere in Pennsylvania, where he meets The Shadow and finds that everything is not as it seemed to be to him. Sam sees some of The Shadow's true face as a woman whom we later learn is a \"shadow assassin\", named Samantha Bannister.\n\n\"A New Way to Die\" is the first standalone episode of the series directed by Greg Beeman. The episode was also written by David Katzenberg, with a story by Katzenberg, Dan Harmon, Justin Halpern and John Altschuler and David Gates, and was produced by Dan Harmon and David Katchenberg. The episode was originally written as a backdoor pilot for the planned The Guild television series.

{"id":1743,"ended":true,"length":353,"text":"Throughout 2000, Carey had already been writing and recording material for Glitter. During this period, she developed the concept for the album's lead single, `` Loverboy ``. Originally, she wanted to release the song as a single late in 2000, much sooner than \" Baby \". It was finally released in April 2001 as the first single of the album, with the accompanying music video directed by Jonas Akerlund (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce ). Later, `` Loverboy `` was nominated for a Grammy Award in the categories, \" Best Pop Rock Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal and \" Best Pop Rock Vocal Performance \". On October 3, 2000, Carey performed `` Loverboy`` at the American Music Awards. This was the first time she had performed the track as a lead single to an album. `` Loverboy`` has become a fan favourite, and was re-released as a single in 2004.\n\nAccording to Billboard, `` Loverboy `` is one of Carey's personal favourite songs, and she frequently performs it live. She chose the track for the album because she wanted to \"sound like a girl in a boy band... or a boy in a girl band \" and to be a \"classic `80s type of song. It's like Michael Jackson meets the `80s -- a little bit of everything.\"\n\nOn February 22, 2001, it was announced that the album would be titled Glitter. The lead single was `` Baby `` and its accompanying music video featuring cameo appearances by Sean \" Puffy \" Combs and Snoop Dogg. Glitter, however, received little to no success upon its release in October of the same year.\n\nCarey went on to record and release the album Encore and, in 2003, the singles `` I Wanna Dance With Somebody `` and `` We Belong Together `` to much greater success than Glitter.","token_len":384,"entropy":[9.5213,0.4396,10.7614,3.2948,4.0576,2.3525,5.1628,3.2736,3.0127,5.3842,0.3883,9.6007,1.9839,3.5555,4.5322,1.9475,2.5713,0.2367,2.2918,4.5866,2.9537,2.1787,1.4558,1.5605,2.8482,2.7717,4.8097,0.2151,0.7319,9.6587,15.985,3.7779,4.8822,1.9089,7.2174,1.0043,1.5848,2.317,0.6805,3.9115,1.5063,2.4568,2.3782,0.4243,0.9954,9.2813,0.2773,3.1688,0.7372,7.29,4.9642,0.2788,6.732,9.3514,9.3444,3.8514,0.773,6.4374,1.0573,1.0189,3.7729,0.8157,3.4756,1.6953,2.125,0.4391,3.1109,0.446,1.0878,1.2421,3.0299,1.2634,3.376,4.1421,0.4236,5.7871,0.1047,8.7454,5.3928,3.7135,1.571,2.896,5.6855,5.6401,0.2396,0.0146,0.0069,0.003,0.0083,2.9269,4.8458,1.0767,7.1238,0.5488,0.0016,1.8367,1.1156,5.483,0.1088,1.7271,0.1012,1.0734,2.6559,2.9563,5.6619,5.7448,4.0346,3.4438,3.6517,4.0848,2.995,2.428,0.3683,5.4099,2.3265,1.2285,7.655,6.5979,0.0804,4.2721,7.7034,0.7563,1.6261,0.4279,6.2304,0.0013,0.1199,4.1919,4.1013,2.7882,3.5326,0.2539,2.6448,0.061,1.3199,5.0578,2.6876,0.6698,0.0022,5.5661,1.1414,0.5723,5.2519,0.7688,0.1337,1.394,4.2521,1.1399,0.8057,0.6494,0.6018,1.5157,0.5419,0.5056,1.8432,4.0003,3.3983,0.707,6.1961,0.0649,5.5148,1.7353,2.1746,0.7472,5.2438,0.6824,0.0022,2.9862,3.3817,3.2967,1.0341,5.4914,2.7612,2.3612,1.679,2.9052,5.402,0.5464,0.7523,1.7274,0.8167,0.6554,1.2279,2.9036,0.7599,2.046,0.1124,5.456,0.0047,6.2903,0.679,2.4088,0.1823,0.0023,1.0021,1.7341,2.7712,0.0086,4.2482,0.0415,5.1689,1.6594,0.9308,1.6949,0.982,2.4572,5.5352,2.8591,0.5645,3.5883,1.0265,1.6075,7.3259,1.6099,2.1057,2.2145,1.5065,2.34,1.9238,2.4322,2.2927,0.3944,4.8065,5.7041,0.6203,1.0106,2.1272,3.0826,0.8776,4.7823,2.9876,5.7253,5.2713,1.2881,1.9635,1.8448,0.2295,0.6432,0.1869,6.8095,2.7763,3.2135,2.9057,2.7575,2.1505,6.0309,8.8451,4.0807,0.0286,6.9357,0.7242,2.5054,4.1434,2.7369,2.6439,4.9618,8.6062,0.1512,4.7101,2.9163,4.6941,1.1386,0.0056,6.2617,2.3807,4.2198,1.7912,1.3792,2.3696,2.2644,2.2576,0.0002,3.2351,2.8592,3.5327,0.1422,2.3879,0.0953,4.6705,0.065,0.4735,0.1562,2.5353,1.5433,0.5416,0.2523,3.8522,7.0257,0.0025,1.0685,1.7477,5.9152,0.0321,1.3013,4.9116,4.5765,3.6474,1.9205,4.3574,1.4293,1.225,0.0723,5.7336,11.859,0.9088,0.6182,6.4701,3.0864,6.5069,3.6344,1.4581,8.0143,0.6385,1.2076,7.3861,0.0706,0.0093,0.0252,0.5461,6.4893,0.0005,4.323,4.3028,0.0213,4.3115,2.8004,5.4351,0.085,5.0269,7.0896,0.9491,0.1168,2.4303,3.7575,3.4159,5.6906,0.3207,0.0023,0.3468,1.7515,0.0002,3.8653,0.0003,5.222,0.1453,0.0981,2.0135,3.5076,1.9314,2.6332,1.4371,11.0675,1.1868,3.6528,5.2795,1.476,2.5226,0.0461,1.9208,4.9683,0.36,4.9849,4.1413,0.0131,3.1736,2.9489,2.331,2.0344,0.1125,0.0317,5.1501,5.4365,0.0767,0.5608,0.962,5.8785,6.1183,5.0109,0.5986,2.0902,4.5257,0.0005,0.4505]}
{"id":124,"ended":true,"length":348,"text":"The Coldrum Stones have been excavated on multiple occasions. On 16 April 1910, the amateur archaeologist F. J. Bennett began excavation at the site, after previously having uncovered some Neolithic lithics from the same area on the shore of the River Coldrum. During the first excavation in 1910, Bennett noticed large rock heaps on the site, and was also aware that these heaps had been used since \"A.D. 1-2, and were evidently the remains of a prehistoric village\". The next excavation took place in March 1921, and the site was again examined in 1925. The largest stone, weighing some 4.20 kilograms (9.60 lbs), was found in the centre of the area which was excavated on 16 April 1910. This particular stone has been named the Bennett Stone, as its discoverer was F. J. Bennett.\n\nThe second largest stone was found in the west section of the same area. On 19 May 1926, the National Museum carried out further excavations and uncovered stone rings in areas containing both the Bennett and the large stone. The National Museum found that these stone rings contained \"stone circles with stones of all sizes and shapes lying in all directions\". The second largest and third smallest stones were discovered at the same time. These have been named the Alderley Stones. The larger stone, weighing 9.1 kilograms (19.90 lbs), was located in the eastern half of the Bennett Stone's circle. The smaller stone was found in the western half. The third and smallest of the Bennett Stones, weighing 6.7 kilograms (15.20 lbs), was found in the northern section of the second largest stone's circle.\n\nStonehenge is said to be one of the most famous monuments in the world, and is renowned for the huge stones that surround it. The stones are of different sizes and made of different types of rock.","token_len":384,"entropy":[10.0809,16.0589,9.6961,4.5838,1.3593,8.7069,0.077,3.5917,6.4438,0.1975,2.0806,4.496,6.0586,2.5896,7.1292,0.6746,1.8255,10.4648,2.1754,0.0284,6.3882,0.6421,3.1638,0.0643,6.777,4.9703,4.018,1.1736,1.0058,1.9963,2.1103,4.8388,7.0308,2.969,5.4817,4.1052,9.8698,0.0653,8.8325,3.3939,2.6625,0.838,4.0573,1.9874,3.7941,1.7726,6.728,0.514,1.1189,3.5533,7.797,0.0755,0.5258,3.8999,0.8571,3.4882,3.194,3.0594,2.8691,0.1826,2.3562,4.0043,5.0984,4.198,8.2733,0.6406,3.0094,0.4061,3.5197,1.3056,2.1814,3.7053,5.4839,3.7927,0.9478,3.4728,1.9747,0.0073,1.8361,0.3961,2.6341,6.6553,7.9566,5.7515,2.6297,0.8048,0.3375,4.2644,3.1232,2.6387,1.5585,3.0477,2.9306,4.9586,3.5847,2.5971,0.0314,2.069,4.3107,4.7516,3.3769,2.2459,4.267,3.9802,2.2881,0.0077,1.0144,4.1682,3.1468,0.6363,1.3601,2.2265,3.7177,0.5762,4.7132,4.6651,1.6028,4.2726,0.5796,1.9734,6.0993,3.2821,4.5754,3.4925,5.3123,3.7585,1.6454,6.4378,2.313,1.5293,2.7105,0.4643,3.9423,1.0485,0.4102,0.4893,0.8189,1.483,1.351,4.4631,0.1221,0.1009,3.5797,4.9508,1.6039,2.9801,0.003,2.8874,2.7624,0.7538,1.0161,0.4924,2.4689,4.3454,0.7138,3.3381,0.9196,4.6756,1.826,10.5171,1.1212,1.283,2.9754,3.3959,7.6311,0.2743,0.2406,3.1722,5.0766,0.0354,0.7729,0.0401,0.0547,0.8794,1.3669,0.0216,1.5814,4.8604,4.1853,0.8146,2.2248,0.9599,0.8876,1.1508,5.9463,4.859,0.0595,0.1,4.2039,0.4933,2.494,3.4031,3.9109,2.0885,4.2998,0.1754,1.5199,5.0861,1.5494,6.5071,0.0765,4.7696,0.6301,0.0033,3.1019,5.0058,5.7549,8.1059,2.5737,5.6826,6.4426,5.1929,2.2695,3.9325,1.4673,1.7611,7.4913,1.435,0.9965,1.6221,5.0237,0.1151,3.0939,2.0823,2.4602,3.8892,0.6035,3.6194,3.7889,5.4616,5.828,3.0657,5.2212,2.7919,3.4182,0.4614,1.2638,1.2058,8.1566,1.9656,3.2019,0.6069,1.3053,1.4228,4.5968,1.0508,4.7304,4.7512,4.8305,1.7483,0.5698,2.0309,2.5507,0.8268,1.0828,0.8251,1.3795,2.5982,5.2554,0.4412,2.0654,0.4423,5.6882,4.18,5.1991,1.8952,1.2067,1.7483,5.9693,1.5161,1.9694,0.7941,4.8916,0.1314,5.0577,0.387,0.0974,3.5611,0.2992,4.0325,0.0742,0.2805,0.2918,4.5085,0.9846,0.4161,4.2019,3.3196,0.0067,0.1264,6.5227,1.1424,5.3799,6.5833,0.8285,1.25,2.7313,0.3978,1.8597,0.4795,1.0659,0.3217,3.5565,1.011,2.5913,1.3648,3.2587,2.4235,5.167,3.9217,1.0703,2.4495,0.8787,1.9943,0.3492,2.7111,0.0577,2.6961,0.0977,0.0052,3.6963,0.0535,3.2294,0.0271,0.1623,1.0634,0.5419,0.8465,0.2089,3.1714,3.4343,0.1407,0.0903,5.0432,3.4583,0.4581,4.9301,0.134,0.241,1.5096,0.0002,4.8656,6.9256,0.0017,3.5787,5.2926,0.03,1.146,2.3548,0.0105,0.1081,1.6372,3.265,3.9249,0.6041,1.2142,0.5038,1.4273,1.0297,1.712,5.7314,0.3487,2.5539,5.0388,3.1578,2.3315,3.3268,0.2356,0.3018,1.5386,2.9158,1.353,4.8403,3.6245,0.4787,0.7429,7.0655,0.7943,0.6403,3.3641,0.345,2.6919,0.8985]}
{"id":2803,"ended":true,"length":333,"text":"The Karlsruhe class ships were 139 meters ( 456 ft ) long at the waterline and 142 @. @ 2 m ( 467 ft ) long overall. They had a beam of 13 m ( 42 ft ) and a draft of 2.0 m ( 7 ft 2 in ). The hulls were framed in iron while the upper decks above their main-deck, the bridge and their funnels were made of wood ( see more below ). Their armaments included up to 24 Krupp guns on the main deck, 6 on the forward superstructure, and 2.6 kpf\/hp on the quarter deck. They were powered by one shaft driven by a steam engine. Karlsruhe had up to 5 steam generators but the power generated was insufficient for her full load of armament as well as crew and coal bunkers so some of her weapons were powered by her own turbines.\n\nThe hulls were built out of 2\" X 4\" X 5\/8\" steel tubes ( with round cross sections in areas below the maindeck ) and were all steel fastened with wood. The boilers were mounted on the deck in a tubular steel casing or in some cases on barges. The boilers were placed in long tunnels with the steam being produced by watertight and self-sealing steam pipes. The turrets were placed in sponsons which acted as flotation devices for the turrets as well as providing a secondary source of armour. The funnels were each fitted with a protective deck cap and they were open topped. There were two funnel opening for each of the sides of the turrets. The armament was on the upper and main-deck and between the funnels was the main funnel.\n\nThe bridge was situated above the foremast and between the funnels. It was supported on two curved steel frames and was also fitted with two sets of elevators.","token_len":384,"entropy":[11.4212,1.8363,0.4209,0.0117,7.6317,8.0142,2.5836,12.3023,4.6944,2.1212,11.7195,5.6912,1.1028,1.198,0.6146,4.6035,0.7516,8.3211,1.0945,1.1437,5.3036,14.3504,6.9096,9.4362,5.1121,3.7034,1.036,2.8448,6.6788,0.0116,0.2681,1.6803,7.8215,0.4812,2.8292,2.1471,1.543,5.5796,1.1316,4.9552,2.5545,0.4261,6.0442,0.0731,0.1025,1.4963,0.8823,7.4822,0.2648,2.9664,0.8826,4.0498,0.1938,0.3369,3.3511,2.2901,5.844,1.4983,2.0084,1.4693,2.9701,3.0986,0.7823,8.7149,2.007,5.8432,7.8362,0.2521,4.6717,2.7664,8.785,5.233,4.8169,7.2226,0.1752,5.4079,3.4728,5.7425,1.648,4.8679,11.2177,0.1349,1.0681,1.9848,0.3187,3.5817,4.1412,6.6297,6.1187,3.2049,0.4806,4.8902,7.5568,1.9674,2.5636,7.4855,0.0975,4.6056,9.7558,0.7543,2.8722,5.2959,2.0206,2.8238,0.6854,1.119,4.3381,5.1793,0.1626,4.8679,4.7729,0.0015,0.8886,1.4586,2.3141,5.5467,3.4184,4.5548,5.5642,3.5881,5.49,4.2007,2.9305,0.167,7.9501,3.3541,0.4349,2.4455,1.223,5.3918,0.136,4.8817,9.0723,5.4196,0.391,0.6534,4.9342,1.0182,1.2404,5.6695,0.0884,0.0018,0.0139,3.6981,6.3667,0.0188,4.0083,5.4327,3.6857,4.9276,2.6336,3.8001,5.7903,2.0553,7.1146,1.8111,6.9916,5.1525,3.6296,1.6861,8.3827,0.463,5.3696,2.3348,0.1868,5.4712,3.0597,9.4831,9.2777,0.0452,7.3038,5.0321,1.0927,1.7371,3.9654,0.6925,4.7686,0.2415,3.9632,1.6801,5.4263,0.4372,1.8185,0.1721,1.6158,4.3855,1.1703,0.9335,3.2107,4.4099,0.1414,4.301,6.3036,6.3481,2.4074,0.459,3.4357,2.7604,3.1424,0.3715,0.2345,2.9467,5.2245,2.8455,5.7427,7.1378,6.4816,1.8682,3.4403,8.3389,3.6751,1.102,3.8378,5.1746,2.5411,1.3758,2.0049,5.3273,4.3949,9.0899,0.1072,1.4885,4.464,2.293,0.8866,5.328,0.0057,0.6793,4.0705,0.9039,1.1918,3.703,3.6728,1.8431,6.6551,0.4273,4.0679,5.1004,5.2311,3.249,5.0953,1.4709,2.0456,8.341,0.0023,1.1642,0.8881,1.6376,0.0055,0.8001,5.0593,1.2555,6.8566,6.6193,2.9677,2.6324,4.9255,4.1571,5.0044,1.1914,6.1701,6.5275,5.0711,6.4051,0.2117,3.8455,0.2173,5.245,2.1,0.8032,0.8247,5.9476,0.6504,3.9591,1.147,6.2387,0.3313,3.7836,5.172,0.2321,5.8853,3.1183,2.9784,1.7728,0.4599,3.5787,4.4174,0.3258,0.0235,4.3394,1.7792,5.5614,5.8477,0.1778,9.2535,1.0632,0.9003,10.8022,0.0012,0.6033,7.1561,3.8809,0.1119,0.876,7.7291,5.3352,5.7528,2.0466,5.3565,0.8055,6.7168,8.6173,2.9898,4.2384,0.5164,2.2091,7.7556,7.241,4.2056,3.6455,1.9706,0.1024,4.2545,0.5836,0.1211,2.7822,1.096,0.951,6.9465,0.1947,1.4574,5.9757,1.0796,3.752,4.8248,5.4698,3.6906,0.0351,2.9727,7.467,0.6673,5.5244,0.0028,1.6428,3.0252,1.7859,6.7509,1.5028,1.6031,0.0003,1.1732,6.2311,1.1262,6.0287,3.1957,0.4594,7.784,1.5206,1.6696,4.4996,0.2365,3.353,0.0029,2.9891,2.2885,0.595,5.4095,2.2777,2.0307,6.8377,4.02,5.4547,2.4859,2.0317,4.6842,3.914,0.0889,2.5996,5.8899,0.0043,7.587,0.1817,1.0612]}

However, when the season ended, Pennock did not pitch at Connie Mack and Joe Jackson got to pitch at Mack, and both pitchers were ejected from the game.\n\nThis is one of the few times when Mickey Mantle was involved in one of those \"trash talk\" incidents. Mantle had said before the game, \"If that son-of-a-bitch wants to throw at me, I'm gonna throw at him.\" The other player was Connie Mack :\n\nI've often wondered aloud what happened to the \"trash-talk\" that Mantle liked to get into before games. I always imagined that both players were really into what they were about to do. I would imagine that Mickey Mantle wanted to go out there and knock the other player out. I have to wonder if this player was scared of Mantle's power, or if Mantle was bluffing. Either way, this is a rare case of trash talk backfiring...\n\nBarry Bonds famously got in the head of Alex Rodriquez at a game in 2006.

{"id":3560,"ended":false,"length":351,"text":"Horses have been used in warfare for most of recorded history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in ritualistic battles by the Aztecs appears to have begun a much sooner date. The modern history of warfare includes the use of cavalry by both sides during World War I, with the Soviet Union using it in large numbers during World War II. Although not used as widely outside warfare, many cultures have kept horses on their military roster, and horses were among the most numerous weapons used by the Americans during the Revolutionary War.\n\nHorses play a significant role in military strategy and tactics. For example, cavalry are the most effective when used as shock troops that break through the enemy lines and allow the more numerous infantry to maneuver as they see fit. Cavalry is also vital for carrying supplies to a field of battle, either by a mule train or in the form of horses tethered in or near the battlefield (for infantry to load them onto small carts). The horse may also serve as a sort of psychological weapon, as an invading force may be repelled by the sight of a large herd of horses charging towards it.\n\nIn some cases, horses are used primarily as riding animals without the use of a blade. It is estimated that approximately 500 million horses currently exist in the world, making it an important animal for human society and culture overall. Due to this importance, horses have been the subject of a considerable amount of exploration by historians and anthropologists, and this site focuses on many of the research efforts carried out on the horse over the years.\n\nSources\n\nWikipedia : Horses\n\nWikipedia : Horses in history\n\nWikipedia : Battle of Hittite War\n\nMilitary.com : Ancient Combat - Horses\n\nHistory.com : The History of War - Horses\n\nBBC : Ancient Warfare - Horses","token_len":384,"entropy":[10.9081,4.3738,1.4773,3.613,1.4555,5.9737,1.2272,6.5612,0.0369,2.426,0.0942,0.9151,2.3308,3.3833,8.69,1.3718,0.9061,0.35,3.8505,0.6221,0.6224,1.556,1.4819,4.9483,4.1936,1.0663,2.9011,0.8843,1.4903,1.7749,2.0359,3.8839,0.0558,0.5114,1.2118,6.8797,4.0526,4.9993,5.6788,1.2819,5.2804,0.189,0.0001,5.8474,0.2134,0.2312,1.6689,5.0922,5.9373,7.6852,5.0103,0.6468,1.9056,6.0207,5.2196,0.0436,4.3498,4.2902,1.6519,2.162,0.0212,4.6365,2.4981,3.8284,3.3921,2.773,4.657,0.0134,0.5437,1.032,3.8868,1.0593,7.5507,0.2747,2.8177,4.3071,1.4703,5.3863,0.9306,0.5442,1.0785,0.0081,0.0438,0.5033,4.4001,3.9106,3.2474,2.1757,4.4503,7.1584,5.5271,0.5489,4.1989,5.6823,1.7228,6.7496,0.2345,3.9448,1.3961,5.3156,7.1587,1.7026,1.4857,2.6813,2.3566,4.8568,0.1965,1.5487,5.5548,2.268,1.1211,0.7188,1.2292,6.247,0.9808,1.1188,5.7117,0.0486,0.3753,1.2419,0.0069,3.9724,0.2637,6.913,0.4519,2.0604,0.1611,0.0536,3.1623,2.9062,1.495,2.4055,0.737,4.1692,0.3464,0.0159,4.4081,5.288,2.7155,1.3138,2.0381,7.4098,2.2177,2.2656,7.5624,0.1223,5.5726,7.0105,1.3382,2.6976,0.4406,1.3752,1.1424,5.4827,1.199,9.0385,5.7147,2.2152,1.064,4.9875,4.7946,1.0504,5.8501,0.0161,0.1824,5.0009,0.0037,2.0036,0.7631,5.7947,1.5228,6.8167,3.4351,2.0368,3.0392,6.3525,2.563,0.5385,0.9529,6.1851,1.8903,4.8132,6.5416,0.4215,5.6462,0.3354,3.8841,1.8597,2.1549,0.0032,3.2648,10.5141,0.0323,4.0436,6.9007,3.6212,1.2073,2.193,5.0829,4.5805,4.8116,3.7728,7.4425,5.0906,4.1261,6.3314,3.1494,1.1631,2.5817,2.3815,4.7295,0.9313,3.1199,0.209,0.4103,5.1514,0.215,7.8416,2.8229,1.9013,1.855,4.8205,7.7627,0.9762,2.0404,2.4177,7.3104,0.0443,0.9697,1.7171,6.4586,0.0537,1.0953,3.6758,1.8531,0.1046,1.109,6.5665,3.8577,2.3066,0.7512,1.3137,0.0002,2.9588,4.1345,2.8265,0.2786,0.8667,1.2384,0.8513,5.2404,1.2478,8.5125,3.5368,7.6347,2.1559,1.3285,0.0037,2.8024,7.0784,1.3679,4.4893,0.3033,4.447,0.0253,4.2955,4.3272,3.087,0.8122,7.6478,2.4542,0.5383,0.3665,1.3691,0.8204,3.7728,2.5509,3.2291,0.8005,3.7725,1.0836,4.1791,3.7221,2.6107,3.7172,7.6361,0.1084,5.7355,0.0166,3.3423,4.6646,0.5557,1.4879,1.6338,0.7311,4.1248,2.2244,0.0039,2.4407,5.0599,0.3616,0.0062,6.5114,2.4393,2.6083,1.311,1.7709,0.0105,1.6492,1.0342,4.3726,5.1609,4.4609,0.6632,5.3419,0.4335,0.7257,6.1405,5.3628,3.568,0.0399,2.4376,2.0316,1.4856,5.3477,0.1686,1.8016,0.2778,0.8431,0.0002,4.3947,1.3034,0.0003,4.6608,6.3086,3.0265,2.9532,0.0002,2.3031,0.8753,2.8009,2.7997,4.1591,0.5531,0.0002,0.8793,0.2082,6.1445,1.1643,3.5636,6.5262,0.5005,5.0614,1.3091,0.0002,7.9207,6.9851,1.0541,0.6905,6.0459,6.6192,6.9088,3.0204,0.9873,0.0002,4.0924,0.8939,0.472,0.1854,2.8278,2.2908,0.0834,2.2559,2.1055,1.5317,0.3661,0.0002,7.1272,1.9921,3.5855,3.4546,0.7751,1.1429]}

Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops are also affected by the hoppers.\n\nIn Canada, the first serious infestation of the pest was noted in Western Ontario in 1909, and was probably first imported by stowaways from Europe through the U.S. At the same time, the hopper was beginning to appear in the U.S., and infestations were reported in Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, and Colorado, but it wasn\u2019t until 1919, when one was noted in California, that the problem really got serious in the U.S.\n\nThe initial infestations of the pest occurred in the Midwest on corn, wheat, and soybeans ; today, it is a serious problem in corn and soybeans, but a lesser problem on the wheat.\n\nLife History\n\nBoth male and females emerge and begin to feed in areas containing both standing grass and foliage. The adults begin feeding shortly after emerging and can live from one day to two weeks depending on temperature. Females complete their first series of flights in early and mid- July. By late July, the second series of flights takes place, followed shortly by mating flights. Male wing flight takes place in late August, while female wing flight takes place in September.\n\nFor the first three months after emergence, adults eat their way out of and up through the soil to obtain plant foods, such as nectar, pollen, leaves, and foliage. By early December, adults become inactive and are ready for the next generation.\n\nWhen the next generation begins to emerge in early March, it moves up the soil to feed, and in late July, this group flies out into the tops of the corn fields to begin the next generation.","token_len":384,"entropy":[7.0236,3.8476,2.3283,7.9419,5.1987,1.9255,0.031,8.5229,8.2172,4.084,5.1534,0.0779,3.6104,1.7313,4.4038,1.5591,1.7302,3.5317,1.9815,7.6906,2.0645,3.79,6.7926,1.1073,4.0537,3.0173,6.7479,0.539,0.3887,9.4726,3.2885,4.2814,7.287,1.0684,8.4925,0.1823,0.4913,7.0353,1.9714,3.5394,1.8707,1.248,2.3006,3.2258,0.8707,2.0126,7.8611,0.9433,0.6117,1.355,0.001,3.7329,4.4991,0.3348,1.7366,4.4118,5.6997,5.5376,0.1407,1.0765,1.7513,7.5969,0.8695,5.4235,0.3423,7.0111,2.6063,0.4495,5.1677,1.1697,1.664,2.4911,5.5359,4.2227,5.3739,1.6888,7.3722,2.7989,0.294,1.5039,5.5077,5.3323,1.266,3.4903,0.0045,0.034,0.1848,6.7106,1.4846,1.6253,0.0044,0.3544,1.5262,4.7518,1.5058,1.6069,4.8718,0.0242,2.7492,0.4496,1.8803,2.1601,0.0006,0.0224,1.1458,1.1492,7.8995,0.8117,0.0727,1.4344,1.1475,0.6857,5.6583,0.8567,2.6444,0.3432,3.6105,0.3909,2.0408,3.9439,2.0805,2.6824,3.1014,4.2155,15.0231,7.7534,1.7266,0.6234,5.0662,1.7773,0.5749,4.9855,4.405,4.9431,0.4819,3.351,0.4609,0.4283,1.2927,3.4909,4.2075,2.4918,1.5351,3.9279,0.969,0.7959,0.0009,0.0127,0.8872,1.2575,0.0003,1.8987,6.2274,2.1774,2.5699,0.0109,1.7856,0.3531,5.2218,2.5566,0.6528,1.5928,4.4835,5.4472,8.7082,1.719,2.3958,0.1383,0.5497,2.8268,0.464,10.2038,8.1512,0.6084,3.0728,0.6631,3.1726,4.0131,1.1782,0.3982,3.6855,1.7743,1.0243,0.6334,1.6748,2.0985,4.5047,4.9644,1.5464,4.2526,2.9055,3.4878,1.5318,1.5203,0.0003,8.0769,1.664,1.1972,0.0002,6.9245,4.7157,0.0696,6.5012,8.4506,4.7332,4.0276,1.0745,2.8068,3.0281,6.8838,5.7168,4.7108,8.9041,4.2191,0.5116,5.3676,0.6561,1.9033,5.0693,3.1134,2.5289,5.6979,0.3004,6.8894,1.9748,3.5788,3.3543,4.6405,4.7338,4.2055,0.2066,1.9211,0.6271,5.4603,0.1114,4.855,0.8901,3.8002,9.2431,0.681,2.6435,6.6804,0.3128,7.4984,2.2121,3.1275,7.9181,2.298,0.4799,7.4054,1.0503,5.401,1.7819,2.1574,0.5732,1.3246,6.6728,2.1715,0.8648,0.4889,4.2476,0.0965,1.6763,3.0564,5.1101,3.0301,6.2839,3.2221,1.1772,5.3583,7.4493,5.4755,3.19,0.0358,1.4613,1.1186,0.989,1.4632,2.9519,1.0794,2.0964,0.0974,0.4256,0.0027,0.362,3.3857,0.2695,1.2421,0.0002,5.2895,2.4673,1.2573,2.4204,2.1087,2.3266,2.4728,0.2611,4.9144,4.9184,4.1771,3.0607,2.6688,0.2916,6.5046,4.7034,2.6443,1.2249,2.8731,3.1775,6.757,5.8406,4.6683,1.6702,1.9838,0.0027,6.1615,0.0714,0.8263,2.4194,0.1795,3.6306,0.2227,1.2417,4.3105,0.2969,3.6216,2.9584,3.7008,0.2032,3.1173,4.2803,4.7599,0.9837,3.1388,4.7945,1.6117,3.1815,1.4736,4.3131,0.8293,1.5767,0.0002,4.2708,1.3727,4.3078,1.1838,2.6236,1.3158,2.198,3.3577,2.4313,2.353,0.237,3.6023,5.4622,3.0464,1.682,2.8231,1.9569,2.8191,2.7781,1.4859,3.7727,1.7278,4.7098,0.6233,5.4666,4.3448,7.6972,2.01,3.0901,0.3977,9.7737,0.0427,1.8952,4.7034,1.1631,1.5959,4.0662,2.4288,1.7656,1.381,0.3969]}
{"id":2355,"ended":true,"length":330,"text":"Some species of bacteria kill and then consume other microorganisms, these species are called predatory bacteria. These include organisms such as Myxococcus xanthus, which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest other cells [ 1 ] and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which produces toxins that kill and devour the bacterium E. coli ( Klebsiella pneumoniae ).\n\nIn spite of the large number of bacteria that can be classified as predators (i.e. they prey on other cells), much less is known about the prey species and their ecology. In the present study, we investigated and compared the abundance, diet and survival of predatory bacteria and prey cells.\n\nFor this purpose, we used single-cell cultures that have been isolated from human and environmental samples [ 2, 3 ]. These cultures are usually derived from clinical specimens such as urine and feces ( Figure S1 ), although some represent a sample from soil or water [ 4 ]. They represent a natural environment for the bacteria ( and parasites ) in question and have been validated as natural models for predatory bacteria.\n\nThe cells were lysed by sonication with a vibrating tip for 10 or 15 s (see below). The cells were collected in microcentrifuge tubes and immediately spun at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min. The supernatant was poured onto a nitrocellulose membrane, stained with DAPI and stained microscopically.\n\nIn general, we detected only 2\u20134 individual organisms per cell of the prey populations. As this could be an artefact of the low number of cells we found, the relative abundance of both prey- and predator-cells in the culture was estimated from the volume of supernatants produced by the cultures. These proportions of prey and predator cells were then compared with estimates of the proportions in actual communities based on samples from the ecosystem.","token_len":384,"entropy":[8.8291,0.8298,3.9074,7.737,3.5201,4.4581,4.8175,2.7811,5.2384,0.121,1.6852,6.9458,4.2788,1.562,1.5494,7.8579,1.2349,0.5074,2.6392,3.7675,6.6639,2.1221,0.0006,6.2028,4.4455,2.7796,0.0068,7.7496,4.6566,1.3382,0.6379,2.6137,6.8322,7.3742,0.103,0.3084,6.7967,1.8747,3.608,1.9421,4.6532,2.0183,4.8521,7.4771,4.8113,3.2571,0.9618,6.5168,0.2463,0.0044,0.5529,0.0154,0.0026,0.0161,0.0038,0.4109,0.1084,4.075,4.613,1.636,2.1373,1.4696,5.7407,0.0036,3.0133,8.1232,0.0288,6.542,0.0229,2.6724,3.6241,8.3827,0.0084,0.0005,0.0048,2.5456,0.0085,0.7757,1.5416,0.0004,2.9558,6.0835,0.0054,0.9151,4.1995,0.9913,0.0186,2.1382,1.8731,2.5423,0.7461,6.3454,0.6915,3.7909,3.5631,4.2679,0.0011,0.0004,1.3256,4.7624,4.8591,0.1276,2.4507,4.5149,1.2383,6.7864,2.3261,1.0873,0.0374,0.092,0.8814,5.4516,3.0572,3.0493,1.4264,3.7071,0.4083,2.8391,1.9895,3.3303,0.1894,0.4007,0.1785,2.029,6.0668,1.1365,0.6474,3.162,3.4134,4.6713,1.2135,4.2281,0.2522,4.5004,0.8664,3.1156,4.0078,5.2682,2.3102,2.2995,0.0002,4.654,2.6214,2.1078,0.1965,0.2294,1.7512,7.1012,0.6137,1.3954,7.4766,3.5805,3.3641,0.2638,4.0273,0.3862,3.6457,2.8645,6.9673,0.3763,4.1286,2.7693,6.9235,0.2476,0.6886,3.8727,1.6115,2.4449,4.3749,5.7358,0.0401,7.5615,1.2526,4.0079,0.001,4.1883,2.2583,1.1171,3.504,4.0037,1.6191,0.7862,1.7256,4.5524,2.5809,8.845,3.9124,4.6957,1.3816,7.4978,1.5234,2.7879,2.3496,0.2668,0.7938,5.3755,5.0793,1.2928,5.0551,3.2843,1.4341,1.3783,1.4289,3.6599,6.4129,7.5637,0.4872,3.4017,4.0572,2.2303,3.1131,0.4785,5.9328,2.587,4.5205,6.8284,1.1408,4.6905,1.5913,1.6419,1.088,0.0002,2.145,7.1193,1.6682,7.2686,0.0902,0.1014,2.2196,9.3381,0.1586,1.9465,1.9593,8.68,0.5031,5.9456,4.4591,2.3202,6.3933,1.7736,2.0781,2.3037,4.3441,3.637,0.891,1.3154,2.2671,0.1718,3.7823,1.9582,5.4169,3.5152,0.1633,0.0265,1.7303,1.7415,2.0681,6.0139,7.8568,2.017,4.6515,2.956,0.5914,4.4641,0.569,0.6374,1.7947,1.0704,1.338,1.0695,6.0296,0.1232,0.4488,0.476,7.4216,2.0655,1.1246,5.3124,0.4042,0.013,0.006,0.005,1.6866,2.511,6.4825,0.436,5.2438,0.4255,1.5685,3.934,6.6009,0.1006,0.0002,2.4335,2.8253,0.0002,3.3539,5.3218,0.0428,3.7333,4.2543,3.9841,3.9041,2.0421,1.3675,5.9592,4.7756,2.0848,1.5411,4.4185,1.5422,6.5599,6.9193,1.2028,4.7509,4.7427,4.8422,0.9164,2.8074,5.6435,0.0034,0.6284,1.7319,6.1933,2.6373,0.0277,2.768,3.8738,3.7452,0.4757,2.3804,5.1681,0.107,0.6534,5.0968,2.1817,4.0373,1.097,1.6703,0.0178,7.8957,2.4299,0.8727,5.3216,0.7923,3.7039,3.0582,0.8908,6.576,0.2871,6.4389,0.0024,1.8513,5.2602,1.5344,1.148,4.0824,0.6169,4.2479,5.4097,2.8175,1.1747,2.2097,0.3122,1.9916,0.8453,2.7579,1.8782,1.5631,6.3436,1.1749,0.9864,5.8004,3.6515,8.3033,8.2028,4.8847,0.0319,4.9646,1.561,1.6182,6.228,1.1722]}

At the western end of the temple, on the north-east corner of the first aisles of the temple, the altar of Bel, a statue of a small dog, probably worshipped as a god, was found ; it was surrounded by four columns (see Fig. 2). The north side of the main doorway on the east end of the temple was decorated with a bas-relief sculpture of a man (rear, above the door, of uncertain identification), wearing a loin-cloth, holding a pail beside him and standing before the altar of Bel ; on each side of him are figures decorated with a similar sculpture. The decoration to the left of the figure consists of two figures of bulls (below the head of the bulls, a scene of a battle between the bulls and humans), with a man in the centre (front). On the right hand side of the relief there are scenes in relief. The bull fighting scene shows the bull facing a charioteer and a human form, probably that of the charioteer and his horse ; the figures and the scene are decorated in relief and painted. On the right side of the relief, a group of people in chariots facing the bulls (left) and a man and six women standing at a well on the right (right). On the right of this scene, a scene of a chariot race, with two chariots, each of five riders, and two horses.\n\n2.

{"id":4726,"ended":true,"length":337,"text":"In the tradition of many of her royal Merina predecessors, the queen ruled from the royal Rova compound in Antananarivo. Between 1839 and 1842, Jean Laborde built the queen a new residence, the Poudri\u00e8re (\"Palace\"), which he also intended to be an imperial residence. It was built on a site where a small chapel was probably first erected by the Portuguese in the early 16th century. A palace was probably built there in the 17th century, though not by the French.[21]\n\nIn the 19th century, the palace was used for royal ceremonies and receptions, but because the old chapel was poorly maintained and not large enough for all royal ceremonies, it was decided to build an entirely new ceremonial building. A plot of land where the chapel and the royal garden had been located was donated to the people of Madagascar by King Andry Rajaonarimampianina in 1886. The Poudri\u00e8re was built between 1888 and 1889 at a cost of 2,000,000 francs ().[21] The palace was built around a central grand hall, which was adorned with frescoes, with a garden at its front, a private courtyard at its rear, and separate quarters for the king and queen on its upper floors.\n\nAt one time, the palace belonged to Louis, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans as part of the ducal estate of Andanavelo. Because the estate passed into the hands of the French after Orl\u00e9ans' death, the palace was given to France. Since 1956, the palace has been the property of the French state. The Poudri\u00e8re was completely refurbished between 1990 and 1992 and the upper levels of the palace were leased to various Malagasy government offices. It is currently the residence of the Ministry of Housing and Territorial Administration, and currently bears the name of Henri Rochefort Palace.","token_len":385,"entropy":[2.6222,8.2604,0.1555,5.3539,2.6783,4.5704,8.7763,11.0027,6.3132,6.6946,0.281,2.7603,2.7015,7.469,2.5134,1.7765,3.4024,10.9659,8.1093,9.8421,1.2972,7.1582,4.4556,0.0247,0.005,1.6653,7.3862,2.5417,4.2818,0.0819,0.4689,2.1044,0.4221,7.7317,8.9401,3.2287,5.6417,1.822,5.4126,3.3091,3.9761,2.9148,2.2914,1.9315,5.8836,6.5745,5.7385,3.1175,8.7816,5.1305,0.2592,2.9358,2.1497,3.622,4.7381,5.2927,0.1223,4.0834,3.9633,4.4384,1.3792,0.5814,3.6985,0.6748,2.4849,2.0465,1.569,2.8295,3.7216,3.1343,3.8016,3.2343,1.2719,7.2612,5.3845,2.2599,2.9463,1.2332,5.2613,1.574,1.9575,3.1302,2.4755,0.0845,0.0475,0.4155,4.338,4.8764,1.295,6.2563,1.4582,2.3471,1.3918,1.1442,2.0391,0.1291,0.1283,1.1727,3.0125,3.7324,3.0027,0.9315,3.6187,6.4654,4.5587,0.0689,0.7421,0.0005,2.2807,1.7322,2.8897,0.0029,0.0631,0.2152,1.3125,3.5852,0.7445,3.3606,1.7984,3.2872,3.8295,1.8658,5.3618,1.2984,2.8843,6.0508,1.9336,6.1938,4.1436,0.4671,5.3857,0.7805,1.6505,3.5502,5.4684,0.0199,1.4127,3.7994,3.3637,4.0609,0.2367,1.3646,0.2527,5.1955,0.5675,2.8888,2.4994,3.6372,0.0913,8.412,2.7477,1.1804,3.6947,8.4233,0.2532,0.2149,5.4951,0.621,3.4325,3.4837,1.3801,2.8728,4.0556,3.1791,0.4585,3.8204,0.8686,4.8285,0.807,0.3637,6.7723,0.35,5.6871,2.6148,4.8455,6.2192,5.065,10.1429,2.6148,7.1538,5.413,4.3043,7.3019,6.4307,5.9361,2.0311,5.9448,0.7019,1.163,6.1685,0.032,0.0243,0.0017,1.2361,2.393,4.8196,4.5228,0.0832,2.1377,4.5785,1.181,0.3256,0.0693,4.3721,0.9078,1.4866,1.8763,0.0139,2.3604,0.0117,11.8849,5.023,3.4872,0.041,1.7936,2.8142,0.8727,3.0876,4.4992,1.56,4.8706,8.8611,2.9542,1.2347,1.8602,0.8945,6.2205,0.1402,6.0377,0.0144,0.0164,1.8361,4.1024,1.6526,6.0403,4.2004,1.732,4.0822,1.355,1.9101,4.8202,3.0249,2.8934,0.6263,1.2761,0.372,0.5079,7.2234,5.2524,1.0994,1.3477,2.0836,0.3473,1.1255,4.4536,4.6244,2.7248,2.5794,0.4095,2.1629,0.0001,4.6756,3.1878,0.6241,0.4277,0.7861,1.2153,5.7848,0.0122,6.6071,5.5528,4.9178,0.0529,5.516,0.241,0.0004,6.6971,3.8995,0.0006,1.0412,7.8828,2.434,0.7253,3.4439,1.4688,5.9171,11.8489,10.3306,3.1134,2.034,5.986,1.77,5.4481,7.5422,3.3031,0.7312,0.9233,0.0007,1.2611,3.4266,4.005,6.0315,0.0041,0.1716,1.8206,0.7157,0.7841,1.1315,1.3933,0.8587,3.8212,0.8193,5.1219,2.942,5.1474,8.4278,0.2727,0.9531,0.8721,0.3885,0.3855,3.7069,3.891,0.0107,0.801,2.3784,3.53,1.2173,1.8404,4.0088,0.0085,0.0032,0.0014,1.1472,6.9037,3.5094,0.0027,4.8019,3.661,0.0694,3.0685,2.3567,2.5097,7.175,3.6753,0.7322,0.1299,1.0293,1.4793,6.5228,1.0118,5.3189,7.981,1.2222,0.0067,3.0864,2.4623,1.0507,3.0266,1.1123,3.0057,1.8525,1.9535,0.0253,0.7062,5.873,0.0687,6.2321,1.2629,9.3662,0.0043,2.8305,1.746,2.2699,6.1719,6.3734,0.2967,1.1349,0.5173,6.812,7.3934,0.969,8.2578,0.9001]}
{"id":1776,"ended":false,"length":205,"text":"In November 1125 Taizong ordered his armies to attack the Song. The defection of Zhang Jue two years earlier served as the casus belli. Two armies were sent to capture the major cities in the center and the north of the Song territory, namely Yizhou and Tuan, the latter of which was later renamed Luoyang. This was also the first case of major Chinese military operations outside the borders of China being launched for political aims. The campaign was successful. The armies entered the capital Suzhou in May 1125, defeating the Song defenses and causing significant damage. The remaining Song cities fell to the Chinese shortly afterwards. Taizong's armies were given generous rewards. Soon after the fall of Luoyang Taizong himself became emperor.\n\nNotes and references\n\nThe sources on this topic:\n\nChing-wei-shen \u666f\u5a01\u8ad6 by P'o Chou-kuang \u8d75\u5ee3\u6e90\n\n\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5343\u81c2 by Hu-hs\u00fcan \u6cb3\u6c49\u70c8 by P'o Zhi-kong or \u6cd5\u514b\u5dfd and \u6c34\u6e05\u6bcb by Su-hsien \u987a\u8a22 by P'o Tzu-ching as well as Wei-chi-hua \u5be7\u666f\u8b6f by Lu-hui \u5fb7\u8a19 and Li-mou \u7fa9\u6bd3\n\nChing-yi shan \u666f\u963f\u771f by Wang Hui and Yu-ming \u5433\u660e by Chang Hsiang\n\nLi Ting-chung \u9ec3\u53d4\u6d85 by Cun-ching \u53f0\u5eb7 and \u9060\u5a01\u7b80","token_len":385,"entropy":[8.2994,8.3679,11.5033,11.7783,3.3618,6.0528,6.2686,2.7528,6.3191,0.2156,3.2949,1.2196,8.173,6.5973,1.9954,9.6551,1.2028,0.3949,6.8575,4.0076,3.8397,10.0571,2.052,0.8584,6.9661,0.4353,1.4886,11.8867,0.0575,0.0006,0.0119,3.4956,5.4512,5.7884,2.5636,2.1007,0.6815,3.4405,1.285,7.6196,2.2769,2.3934,1.0131,7.3515,3.5175,2.1943,4.8986,1.8714,0.6655,0.8779,6.4797,1.4578,6.9088,4.8765,3.8301,1.5559,0.642,4.3495,5.7922,4.1371,3.3684,1.7003,1.5921,0.039,0.942,5.3155,3.7262,5.3419,2.2159,0.0508,0.8138,4.0414,2.2468,4.3496,0.6112,1.8051,6.885,0.7045,5.4153,4.0121,2.4897,3.4117,4.0407,1.0281,5.3524,0.0615,1.4794,6.9532,3.1883,5.2427,4.0212,5.5886,0.4854,2.1278,6.0307,1.5395,3.6857,2.3792,1.9417,5.1191,5.8386,0.8431,5.2618,9.4155,0.0148,2.0847,3.4425,2.7356,0.427,1.1974,5.6469,0.7979,1.9461,7.658,1.4186,5.9188,4.2733,1.1795,2.038,1.4864,5.332,4.6305,5.1668,3.9949,1.5184,0.2983,4.0311,7.9079,1.2649,0.6277,3.8512,0.001,0.0016,1.431,3.88,1.8366,5.4787,8.1079,4.5919,2.4705,6.8052,0.6913,1.3103,3.085,0.0394,2.5364,0.001,0.0023,4.2457,0.0029,0.0035,5.2299,2.7202,3.3234,1.0358,1.4047,0.0326,5.7626,3.8185,1.6218,0.9901,0.0002,3.4449,5.5722,4.0554,1.2541,3.0782,4.2777,0.76,0.0002,5.2548,5.1666,3.0169,6.1923,3.1344,4.7001,1.4779,5.5717,3.8851,2.2456,2.7755,4.2682,1.5737,2.9221,4.4521,0.7467,7.6612,5.9592,8.0984,5.2506,8.0948,2.4129,5.9104,3.7547,5.0399,3.8603,5.8402,3.1672,3.2037,4.3252,2.4219,5.0617,0.3877,3.8516,0.0003,5.2184,3.8397,2.1127,5.4243,2.2815,4.8164,3.3146,2.3014,2.8402,5.2669,1.9708,4.2006,2.4591,4.0354,4.3742,2.259,2.0261,3.904,2.6669,2.0073,3.3152,2.8645,2.9508,4.7241,1.6651,1.3857,4.5611,0.3555,1.1485,5.2097,1.7369,0.435,4.4791,3.3488,8.6418,4.7103,3.1874,2.5214,4.079,2.8927,5.0643,5.5333,4.9177,2.0946,3.5889,1.4296,1.8696,3.4512,1.5664,2.3765,3.4409,4.0381,0.8795,5.2741,0.4591,3.5091,3.6789,3.3871,3.8743,4.1002,2.2342,3.4422,7.8681,2.5879,3.4278,0.0209,0.066,4.1725,3.1453,0.3524,5.3312,6.7336,0.6613,0.0468,7.1575,0.4874,4.8253,2.3227,5.4042,2.5131,4.0434,6.7232,2.2411,4.0997,0.6005,2.7801,3.6081,3.3297,0.5794,5.0239,1.0769,3.2001,0.72,1.9356,3.7865,4.2088,1.9563,3.4544,4.3192,3.6697,5.1761,0.1538,4.8504,3.0641,3.0009,3.1566,2.4063,2.0728,2.7984,4.6144,3.7286,0.0003,4.6861,1.7747,0.1796,5.8244,6.7741,2.3436,1.5509,1.7794,0.2363,3.8747,3.2731,1.671,5.0021,0.6125,0.7017,4.0417,4.2042,1.7261,4.2856,4.3542,0.4827,3.1941,1.6437,3.3476,4.3874,4.2234,0.9074,1.1319,5.9406,3.4807,1.9803,3.101,2.0072,0.0002,4.5212,6.2221,1.9944,0.5185,2.5573,2.5028,2.586,4.0318,3.5894,4.7286,5.4519,2.5216,7.9126,2.0477,5.373,4.1115,0.4677,5.5402,1.8789,3.4707,3.6349,5.1865,2.3103,3.8347,4.6459,3.3004,4.7329,2.9409,4.0152,0.4163,4.0595,5.0055,1.8825]}

This was supposed to be a new jurisdiction split from the one of San Nicol\u00e1s de Bari, which was on the other side of the lagoon. But the local church authorities were alarmed, and warned the Bishop, Father Francisco de los R\u00edos, that it was against canon law that a \"friar\" (priest without a bishop) should be given a curacy, without the Bishop giving his leave first. The Bishop, however, ignored the warning. On the 19th of March 1821, Mendoza was expelled from his new See and sent to the old one of San Nicol\u00e1s de Bari.\n\nThe new bishop, Jose Mar\u00eda San Mart\u00edn, who replaced the aged Antonio L\u00f3pez Parrondo in April 1822, at once summoned Mendoza to the diocese of Palermo. This time Mendoza did obey, but he did not accept the bishop's offer. After a month of discussion, San Mart\u00edn sent Mendoza a brief letter, which he refused to accept. So San Mart\u00edn took Mendoza before the tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura and he was expelled from Palermo.\n\nOn his way to the tribunal, he went to Montevideo where he spent more than a year in exile. Then he tried to enter Montevideo, although this was forbidden, but was once stopped on the road and arrested by the Spanish authorities who thought him a Jesuit. When he explained who he was, and why he had to see the Pope, the police released him immediately, but a few days later he was again arrested and taken to Montevideo, and the authorities demanded money and his possessions in order to release him. He left Buenos Aires and returned to Chile, where he remained some time.","token_len":385,"entropy":[8.5492,0.6051,8.5756,0.0006,2.0012,5.9339,5.1902,1.2031,1.6988,7.0644,3.0572,11.5046,5.3598,1.4165,6.8173,6.1146,0.0852,2.9389,7.4047,2.7862,0.0003,1.5011,3.8327,1.4491,6.8833,0.003,0.4274,1.6398,3.9028,7.8125,9.6802,3.2987,1.1977,3.4435,2.2712,3.131,6.1494,0.3302,1.5337,6.4586,4.9455,2.1647,2.0824,1.4427,5.0578,0.3609,2.3685,0.0566,0.0437,0.2971,8.1725,0.0119,0.6547,2.1807,1.859,4.7015,6.3153,3.9754,2.2353,4.8236,1.8728,0.4636,6.8782,1.6635,4.7101,3.4333,6.1729,4.4366,2.4831,5.8445,4.1172,1.7243,0.099,0.6546,0.9377,3.2419,1.2611,5.7501,6.6186,0.0057,2.3416,2.8566,5.2502,4.9738,5.7081,3.5022,2.4501,3.0671,4.8764,0.1027,8.0187,1.0479,2.7646,0.2577,1.0895,1.0232,4.8507,2.4868,3.7314,0.6118,2.4527,5.8411,2.2157,4.5066,5.1468,2.4296,6.8961,7.911,0.2685,1.8284,1.2817,2.5953,2.0368,0.0184,5.809,1.0858,1.5857,2.1069,3.3899,1.6085,4.0202,0.0206,0.4707,2.9446,1.0631,6.4468,0.3674,9.1259,0.7079,0.0019,2.5771,4.9318,0.4298,1.9622,4.4902,12.1916,4.384,3.1078,0.4338,1.6147,5.4675,3.2519,2.9665,1.0866,1.0288,0.0005,0.258,0.2205,0.0062,0.7517,2.1457,0.0644,1.8599,2.9458,2.8147,1.5617,4.6939,4.9397,0.5649,6.2507,3.4168,0.1233,1.2648,3.1834,6.4314,1.9568,9.0635,5.0608,4.6796,0.6601,0.0006,7.0841,2.256,7.0434,2.9776,3.9189,1.174,0.875,0.0845,5.8976,2.6751,5.4582,1.254,0.0005,0.0006,0.566,1.4255,5.8201,0.1064,0.4607,4.0356,0.0955,0.0005,0.9243,3.9477,3.5026,3.0618,0.0003,0.0006,3.8209,10.2039,1.7282,1.5167,1.987,2.2892,0.301,4.5522,0.6694,3.5137,0.0414,3.0533,1.4933,3.9809,1.6103,4.1349,1.0493,4.4988,0.5541,4.8357,0.9426,0.0034,3.7087,1.8957,0.0009,0.0016,2.1968,6.3465,0.9223,1.5124,1.9077,1.2392,5.4551,0.3039,2.1726,0.6138,5.6118,2.8503,0.0538,0.0018,3.8841,3.5287,0.0006,0.0015,6.6535,0.8174,4.2657,1.4048,1.5273,5.3299,0.0191,7.6632,1.1295,0.0423,2.8628,5.2261,1.8882,4.2529,0.7916,2.559,0.0024,0.0023,0.4841,1.0459,0.0002,3.0255,4.7054,2.9964,0.6881,1.2354,1.1062,0.878,2.3981,4.889,1.2207,5.5551,2.1908,2.387,0.5566,5.1304,5.1519,0.105,1.2459,0.7583,1.5647,2.5765,0.4922,4.9747,1.0852,5.6928,0.3929,3.9985,4.1396,0.0097,1.6425,5.4,3.8505,0.6654,4.5544,3.4396,2.4905,1.8559,8.6492,7.704,4.7161,0.9407,2.5568,3.2647,3.7724,1.6451,0.7033,4.1462,1.4164,4.4479,5.5155,4.6277,1.2944,6.8347,0.4035,3.6395,0.5449,8.1698,7.4103,0.3879,0.0913,0.66,4.6742,1.5109,0.15,1.6308,2.7339,6.7044,1.2524,3.6717,0.3372,1.0861,3.4302,6.4183,0.0851,4.813,1.9865,1.5939,4.8938,2.0115,0.7009,0.0771,1.0186,0.6266,2.9597,1.4051,1.6839,2.8971,0.3126,1.9153,0.0138,2.2233,3.5843,3.1968,2.7139,5.3836,5.9562,2.2967,2.5102,6.0997,4.0865,2.4278,0.0743,4.1888,0.1662,0.2936,2.1642,5.3556,5.277,0.0007,2.0569,2.265,0.1077,6.4719,1.7307,0.3026,0.173,2.6777,7.4452,0.9285,1.3187]}

(The largest was Littorio.)\n\nThe ships of the class did not carry the guns of the smaller classes, but carried a battery of 12 6.7-inch (180 mm) guns in three turrets and three 5.7 and five 5-inch (127 mm) guns in casemates. The 5-inch guns were placed directly on the foremast, but had to be shifted if the ship needed to navigate on the beam to turn. The ships carried one 12-inch (305 mm) torpedo tube in the bow. The Italian naval strategists had always favoured more armament than was carried on the actual warships and felt that in most areas small torpedo boats were more effective, due to their speed. The Italians believed that torpedoes were effective only with long ranges. As a result, the first series of vessels, all smaller, carried only two torpedo tubes. All the classes were equipped with two 5-inch (127 mm) torpedo tubes, but the ships in the second series carried additional 5.7-inch (127 mm) guns in secondary armament. Littorio was one of the first of the older ships to have a second torpedo set installed. All the five classes were of the same general construction scheme with the same number of masts, and all the ships carried between two and four barbettes or gun turrets on each main deck.

{"id":2267,"ended":true,"length":354,"text":"Although the syndicated Millionaire had produced two millionaires in its first season, Nancy Christy's May 2003 win was still standing as the most recent when the program began its eighth season in fall 2004. Christy, who had won the first four installments of the season's $1 million special, became the third contestant, along with Charles Nelson (whose victory in the fifth season's Final Reckoning special was the show's first season-ending cashout) and Lisa Whelchel ('98), to win at least three episodes of Millionaire.\n\nChristy's early success came into conflict with the show's format. The first four specials had featured \"wild-card\" contestants - who only participated in the final round had they won their corresponding weeks' competitions; in Christy and Whelchel's case, they never appeared as wild cards. However, in April 2003, Millionaire began introducing an extra contestant to the final round during the first few weeks of the summer season run in order to expand the pool and guarantee more money in the end. In turn, contestants were eliminated more quickly in the first few shows of the season. On February 5, 2003, Millionaire began using a first-to-three elimination scheme to compensate for the addition of another contestant, with the wild-card rule implemented on April 9. At this point, Christy was one of two remaining contestants. During the fifth season, an eliminated contestant would return to the final round in the event another contestant was eliminated; as the first time such a rule was used in the show's history, the game also featured nine finalists. On October 24, 2003, Millionaire returned to its four-participant format (with the exception of its Final Reckoning special), in which Christy was eliminated the following week.

{"id":2742,"ended":true,"length":333,"text":"The Tories had last governed Canada under R.B. Bennett, who had been elected in 1930. Bennett's government had limited success in dealing with the Depression, and was defeated in 1935 by the Liberals led by Lester Pearson. Lester Pearson's first government (1935-1958) included four other premiers: Arthur Meighen of Quebec (1935, 1935-1944); William Aberhart of Ontario (1935-1938; 1940; 1944-1949); John Diefenbaker of Alberta (1936-1938; 1945); and John Bracken of Manitoba and Saskatchewan (1945).\n\nAfter serving as minister of transportation in the Bennett government, Pearson had left the House of Commons but was elected to the Senate in 1930 and was appointed to the Cabinet on becoming prime minister. He then defeated the Bennett government at the 1945 election with a \"coalition\" of Liberal and Unionist MPs.\n\nHe also brought Quebecois and western seats to the Liberals and had to fend off charges of western alienation that was a result of federal policies in the West such as the Assiniboine Dam. He ended up losing the next election in 1949 to Diefenbaker, but held the premiership for another six years, as Pearson had done.\n\nPearson is remembered by some for his famous \"We Shall Overcome\" speech at an international anti-American protest in Ottawa in January 1950, at the height of the Korean War. He and the Soviet premier Joseph Stalin were the only two world leaders to attend the anti-American meeting. But he was also criticized for his approach to Canada's western provinces, especially Alberta, a province heavily dependent on government handouts from Ottawa. In 1957, he broke the country's energy policy by signing a $12 billion (U.S.) deal with the national utility Hydro Quebec to export to Quebec the oil royalties from Alberta.","token_len":386,"entropy":[11.2177,3.6035,6.7052,8.7695,6.7917,3.4719,8.3179,2.441,2.9361,0.017,3.4814,1.2226,1.5467,2.1361,1.7968,2.8627,1.3031,6.1987,1.0478,3.4254,2.4347,2.8684,1.5725,6.5299,5.9696,0.6165,4.5427,0.0095,1.1862,5.3217,0.9319,1.5668,3.14,4.1127,0.8815,4.0336,1.5415,1.321,1.2191,6.934,0.0201,5.2696,0.3864,0.3425,7.9541,0.5255,2.5869,4.7615,2.6804,5.4634,0.7671,2.2126,0.7181,1.0386,5.8231,0.0467,3.8823,5.3104,5.7797,4.2444,0.001,1.7738,5.4297,7.2163,4.8637,0.5651,3.8929,5.0025,2.0155,0.3373,2.5093,4.8427,3.8272,1.1467,0.4121,3.5097,2.3932,4.0154,10.1524,7.396,0.2835,2.3257,0.3772,0.0521,1.8852,0.7221,0.1074,3.0333,3.7947,3.6703,3.2648,2.8744,0.8206,1.1624,1.8035,0.2852,3.2087,3.8828,0.6964,0.0273,0.0122,0.0005,0.1252,2.845,0.1555,0.0659,1.9265,0.2985,0.3467,2.4356,1.0432,1.9159,2.3399,0.8523,2.622,7.2595,3.1393,0.9082,1.4636,1.3683,4.4031,2.879,1.1782,3.4576,1.5558,1.3746,0.004,3.9493,6.1693,0.9394,2.406,0.4668,4.2408,1.8665,0.8613,7.9333,0.3329,0.4509,1.5693,3.7555,5.4133,1.1748,4.7038,0.2213,0.0135,5.795,2.1448,1.7401,1.3623,0.8084,2.5813,0.4728,6.822,2.4253,2.3865,3.048,1.6477,0.5956,4.2307,3.2024,11.5769,2.182,0.0045,1.528,1.6598,3.837,7.4127,2.3336,8.6428,0.3082,4.1045,0.2033,4.6584,0.7267,4.3183,1.62,6.8419,6.6781,0.0595,1.1738,1.2789,4.5893,1.0822,6.8199,0.1359,1.4457,1.0058,1.4687,0.0002,4.5913,3.3233,5.4712,6.2788,4.7476,2.6918,8.7523,8.8147,0.7472,0.6953,3.7387,2.4991,4.8193,4.3707,4.1024,0.0157,5.77,0.5603,8.8279,8.4307,3.634,4.9122,4.561,3.9142,0.006,6.1107,4.0161,3.1948,1.1491,4.7132,5.1953,0.0018,0.8002,8.9323,0.3416,0.0008,0.0134,6.7854,2.7243,2.344,5.4461,0.341,2.9458,1.2596,4.7688,0.3207,2.3407,3.2373,2.2318,6.304,0.9206,0.0088,0.0086,0.0011,1.2611,2.2464,5.569,2.143,4.6057,0.1233,1.2678,2.7636,2.5266,0.1432,2.153,4.0672,7.1397,3.1626,2.2516,3.1317,0.5588,0.0002,1.6536,0.0016,4.6833,2.3982,2.531,2.6892,2.0938,0.7675,6.6612,2.1511,6.5927,2.8249,0.2516,0.0034,0.2948,0.2305,2.34,5.1507,3.6023,6.8915,0.0913,5.7448,2.8028,0.7407,5.4165,0.6904,4.3531,3.0486,1.4099,4.1957,1.9293,1.4129,0.0069,0.3161,5.1533,0.1614,0.4305,1.7438,5.4134,2.6962,6.5038,7.7017,5.9616,0.2037,2.124,4.3368,1.257,1.2813,4.0054,0.0779,0.8153,4.2067,0.5708,6.0066,0.0059,1.4985,4.9841,0.8127,5.9081,2.478,1.2308,2.157,4.9579,0.5638,1.3994,5.8478,0.251,4.2563,0.6369,6.488,3.6802,1.2374,3.0474,4.4505,0.9541,5.1662,1.6559,6.6193,2.1659,0.0732,6.7929,7.2233,0.0275,2.7974,3.4727,0.2623,3.6015,4.5512,0.4293,1.6315,6.7528,2.8005,6.4738,0.2214,7.3858,2.3131,1.3358,3.1988,0.8797,4.2866,4.5056,0.9832,5.5036,2.1867,0.0057,0.0188,0.1041,4.3479,0.5415,1.1673,7.8976,3.6716,5.7284,3.3707,1.4565,4.6725,4.7402,3.6961,2.0563,3.1361,8.7238,2.3289,3.1988,1.4103]}
{"id":844,"ended":true,"length":346,"text":"Meyerbeer had no pupils and no direct'school '. Yet as his works spanned the golden age of grand opera, clear traces of his influence can be found in the grand operas of the 1780s, especially those of Johann Adolph Hasse's \" Il Pirata \". The influence of Meyerbeer is apparent throughout these works, in particular in the manner in which their composers present an epic tale of grand adventure, with the main character cast primarily as a lover, with occasional appearances for other characters. Meyerbe-, er's influence is best seen through the opera's use of color and the orchestration.\n\nMeyerbeer's operas are usually written for large instrumental forces (often with full chorus) that are often employed in very elaborate and technically demanding passages as well as in simpler passages. In general, the music has very colorful orchestration : instruments are carefully matched to musical themes to create a beautiful picture. This also applies to the use of choruses ( and often to the use of small groups of singers ) which, due to their wide use, also have an important role in shaping the overall emotional content of the work, as does the color of the orchestra. As mentioned above, the use of color is particularly prominent in the music of Wagner : the color of Mozart is the predominant color in Mozart as well as in early Beethoven, although color is used in the classical period, although at a minimum; it is more prominent in the early romantic period and after Wagner. The use of color is also used in many of the operas of Gluck which, like Mozart and Beethoven, are characterized by a very large group of instruments. The use of color is also used by Bizet and Puccini in many of their operas. Composers also began to use this color later in the 19th century, most notably Meyerbeer.","token_len":386,"entropy":[9.6042,0.4614,12.655,5.773,3.8543,11.904,2.9198,2.8409,8.1654,11.1368,10.1401,12.2472,5.606,4.5296,4.0774,7.6767,8.1986,0.1381,2.2057,9.7103,0.4813,0.078,8.085,4.4683,0.7986,10.4727,7.8484,0.1101,2.2252,3.7004,3.5467,0.2583,0.59,0.4374,1.299,6.4022,4.6066,0.2093,0.7487,2.103,4.8862,4.4941,0.1963,1.3753,3.7128,2.498,0.967,5.5804,5.6445,0.9351,9.9135,3.0777,2.6781,3.0576,11.7512,10.2078,2.5812,3.8354,2.2669,5.2603,0.305,3.9336,0.1508,2.0128,4.2565,3.8201,4.0949,0.8246,0.9789,4.113,2.1678,1.1259,0.9295,6.8595,0.1674,0.0006,5.3126,4.6295,0.3982,4.5264,4.8984,6.8569,4.4519,0.7858,6.1785,3.9634,1.6765,3.5268,2.2262,4.6866,0.9329,8.2015,6.7362,1.4784,2.1,7.4192,2.2868,4.5996,6.34,4.7706,5.804,5.1387,0.9388,1.0704,3.3549,8.792,9.9926,8.5946,7.158,6.3029,1.3038,5.9841,2.0431,3.5895,0.9169,5.8893,1.9189,4.796,0.0188,7.0909,1.8207,2.1834,5.7621,1.4597,3.0524,2.49,0.5146,2.2623,0.0183,0.0094,0.3168,0.7221,3.3289,0.0785,1.3468,4.1698,4.1651,3.8805,4.5473,8.4363,9.0757,3.0707,3.8571,2.7037,6.1856,6.6195,2.3546,3.1982,1.4432,2.5815,5.2798,1.3786,6.4889,5.1713,2.4924,7.1828,2.3644,4.8588,5.1122,0.6822,0.2257,2.1204,7.1584,1.6765,1.1158,2.4548,5.5017,0.3595,2.3298,4.1623,4.6407,4.6638,8.3209,5.8773,0.9828,8.8296,7.9684,2.057,5.991,5.261,1.1994,4.678,4.4431,3.7106,1.8773,0.9244,4.403,5.0271,1.4752,3.3929,4.566,2.9652,0.2043,1.0137,3.1715,0.0113,6.5973,0.6172,0.0123,3.7514,7.0995,4.4735,2.3864,1.0902,1.5597,0.0361,5.2893,5.3039,0.5717,1.8513,2.2149,2.9141,3.6193,5.536,0.0065,1.1366,4.3516,3.8275,0.433,5.0852,2.5276,2.7026,2.6179,0.9697,0.2615,4.4724,0.3446,3.2957,5.9817,3.6825,0.3612,0.2661,2.6783,3.1949,2.1358,5.6636,0.3987,6.7463,1.3137,0.2662,3.5187,1.6985,4.1589,3.9135,1.0327,0.0587,1.784,2.4388,0.0151,1.6921,2.1354,3.6946,3.2108,0.3,1.4054,4.0593,0.4148,5.5232,4.9314,1.6626,2.83,0.8096,6.8484,0.0038,3.0569,3.7164,3.7614,0.4647,1.2994,6.4346,0.0139,7.8615,1.1591,0.279,0.6661,7.2964,6.1389,0.0124,0.0,2.5767,4.2254,4.7689,1.607,3.6979,1.299,2.005,5.6865,5.3932,3.0259,4.8767,5.2004,2.3261,4.3807,7.8627,3.0231,0.5176,4.8451,3.0441,0.2198,0.9265,3.2904,7.6615,3.5403,2.427,6.2568,2.4611,1.9607,2.0033,1.7837,0.0195,0.7581,1.8003,0.9408,3.0067,0.4662,2.9422,0.9163,0.6976,2.9867,0.0293,0.8507,9.4585,3.5901,6.7059,2.7167,2.1369,6.4403,0.0044,3.0675,2.4652,0.0002,0.0001,0.1531,1.6251,4.2869,0.1021,1.4806,3.1773,3.8293,4.7069,0.1529,3.5758,1.6622,2.209,1.6043,0.0208,0.3915,1.4319,0.7721,1.5782,3.3403,5.5347,7.3547,0.3137,2.0661,7.9803,0.6084,0.12,0.7933,2.73,0.3937,1.9293,0.7691,0.0036,0.9875,7.4554,0.2663,3.4442,8.2271,0.729,0.6294,4.6605,0.7837,6.1523,0.8077,0.6701,1.902,0.0053,0.0863,1.0103,5.237,0.2965,7.4042,1.1016,2.3688]}
{"id":3243,"ended":true,"length":330,"text":"The game is set in Ferelden, one of several countries in the mythical continent Thedas. Demonic creatures called the Darkspawn dwell within the Deep Roads, an underground highway system created by the Divine. The Darkspawn are a race of demonic creatures that emerged around 2,000 years before the destruction of Ferelden, after an ancient evil known as the Void broke free of the Keep. The Divine did their best to seal this malevolent entity into the world with a barrier. However, the barrier was eventually breached, and the Void escaped into the world. At the time, the divine believed and hoped that they had eradicated all evils within the world, but the Darkspawn had survived by inhabiting the Deep Roads.\n\nThe Void has begun attacking the surface world as its last line to enter Ferelden, in an effort to destroy the Keep. As the Darkspawn seek to destroy the Keep they attempt to invade the world in order to get to the Keep.\n\nCharacter Creation\n\nThe protagonist of The Witcher series, Henry Cavill played by Geralt of Rivia, is a Witcher, a rogue class, or Warrior of the Wood - an assassin and murderer for hire. In the games he can wield a steel sword, dagger and a cane. His signature move is the Witcher's Wit, where he strikes with his cane. When creating your own Witcher character you can choose from one of the eight classes; Rogue\/Assassin, Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Cleric, Assassin, Warrior\/Magician, and Templar. You can also choose your gender and race.\n\nThe game consists of both open-worlds and the main story. The open-worlds are filled with the many towns and villages throughout the continent. Geralt travels from town to town, and at times this involves many side-quests.","token_len":386,"entropy":[6.8795,1.6122,2.5894,0.4195,8.3267,1.9842,0.3583,0.0125,0.584,5.0121,0.0198,4.6581,4.0891,1.526,0.5765,10.8966,3.796,8.151,3.6314,0.0025,0.9458,12.1765,3.2267,4.0054,2.6941,4.2242,1.793,1.6633,0.0472,4.4694,3.3805,0.5746,7.6767,1.8745,1.0631,4.4704,3.3302,5.0651,4.7919,4.6209,0.4697,0.85,7.2447,3.872,1.7676,0.8439,0.0016,0.0217,0.0003,1.3197,2.7319,2.0481,0.0691,4.1762,1.145,1.4264,6.4434,6.0297,4.2127,1.1713,0.4737,0.2687,3.2342,0.7007,4.6443,0.0257,5.1968,0.0058,0.0012,0.0144,2.406,4.0886,3.5726,1.8664,4.2077,4.5073,0.0385,0.8101,5.583,8.3666,2.2039,1.1747,0.8869,7.2688,1.001,1.5736,7.3405,5.6456,6.5149,1.1334,0.0477,5.844,3.9172,11.3331,0.0071,1.8753,3.7758,0.8167,2.2716,4.7994,1.5948,5.8237,3.6569,2.7708,0.0768,1.4119,2.841,1.1471,3.7548,1.417,1.9416,1.0537,0.8473,3.4485,5.1602,2.918,0.2849,4.1863,1.3968,5.6222,0.7882,2.1252,0.8081,0.8669,5.5959,4.9975,7.2362,5.6746,0.743,3.2054,3.5599,5.2333,0.0029,2.9738,6.7157,3.0981,0.5458,0.9589,0.9659,1.2606,1.7207,1.0488,0.0007,0.0118,0.0007,3.2373,6.5285,3.508,8.6081,0.0015,0.6496,2.0172,0.0143,1.4719,1.6873,0.0014,1.5848,5.7059,2.8111,5.9233,4.2079,0.8529,5.6964,1.9462,4.8413,4.4193,3.6835,4.2689,7.1176,4.6616,2.5394,0.0004,0.0011,0.0027,1.2339,4.6436,2.5487,1.4528,0.0129,2.4348,0.7458,2.6902,0.6881,3.3542,1.027,1.2246,0.0006,0.0071,0.0002,4.0949,0.2985,2.2509,0.4975,0.4881,4.5991,3.6052,0.056,4.2581,0.9189,2.4004,3.6763,1.7824,0.0117,5.0294,2.0907,0.6456,2.6474,1.4093,3.0447,0.0002,6.1661,3.5835,1.473,0.0002,1.227,4.9364,1.0102,2.2904,2.0031,3.1425,1.7398,9.1644,5.6604,0.0114,6.4908,2.4765,3.1153,0.0302,0.9944,0.0019,0.0002,0.8233,0.6404,0.9924,6.6509,2.4969,1.6883,6.1448,6.116,3.5639,4.2001,6.4221,2.5262,0.4955,8.1652,6.6627,2.7477,4.3307,3.2472,6.2806,5.6704,2.5697,0.4637,3.0069,1.3387,4.5587,2.5599,4.2198,3.4714,1.181,7.7321,1.3224,0.8015,5.5302,3.0405,2.5963,6.0322,1.3407,2.3916,5.4362,2.8088,0.2512,1.5616,6.8246,1.9473,7.8399,5.8264,5.3428,0.2229,4.0889,1.6855,1.03,4.7882,1.5597,4.2414,7.8353,6.0701,3.3135,3.8255,1.2572,2.2974,1.6212,1.2046,1.7334,3.7144,0.0726,1.3189,5.01,2.0262,5.1137,5.7277,5.4166,4.2384,0.0214,0.3423,2.6282,1.0408,3.294,0.4552,3.3919,0.4803,4.5571,0.0027,0.3964,4.7859,0.5189,4.8645,3.2568,5.5131,0.9122,0.5706,2.9668,6.1722,0.1114,3.2645,0.3927,0.9498,0.75,3.6485,6.5049,1.9561,2.5326,1.3067,0.6619,0.0002,1.8843,3.0714,5.546,0.0537,7.2253,4.2503,1.3999,0.0636,5.6274,0.5531,4.9059,3.001,1.7459,1.1284,1.2062,1.987,0.6296,0.0064,1.2311,1.2643,3.9858,0.0255,4.0158,4.4363,3.5608,0.8186,1.1281,4.7717,0.4848,3.5719,1.2134,7.9799,0.0012,3.4023,4.0071,1.1636,0.0095,0.0089,1.4473,2.8342,5.165,2.6003,6.4977,4.9937,6.792,5.1746,3.1076,0.6136,0.0002,1.2193]}

Syers was not present for the wedding of Laurence and Joan, and did not attend the opening of Laurence\u2019s theatre, the Shaftesbury Theatre (which both women had played in), a few years later.\n\nThere is speculation in the books 'The Duchess of Bedford and the Theatre' and 'How the Duchess Saved London', that the reason for this was because her presence might have brought the affair to light prematurely.","token_len":386,"entropy":[7.564,8.9838,0.8005,7.3884,9.8847,1.4686,2.4646,3.0649,8.2972,6.3191,0.7181,5.1699,4.7747,12.1452,3.029,0.3697,1.5779,2.1097,1.9694,5.1073,3.4669,0.3315,7.5235,3.3878,1.4397,5.625,2.1085,4.5008,3.9507,2.3829,0.0524,0.5935,5.4849,2.876,4.0591,1.1276,4.1224,3.8149,3.5181,2.7552,1.9503,2.8447,4.0786,0.1992,4.9982,5.2732,1.1207,6.2755,1.103,1.198,4.3345,0.2467,0.7735,1.6582,0.3956,8.1729,0.2578,2.0824,4.2936,6.1965,1.5012,1.971,2.0706,3.7716,2.8567,1.2422,3.4565,0.5899,1.2041,0.0067,1.9082,0.4788,3.2606,0.0555,2.5912,0.4041,1.2384,0.0058,8.2122,0.0343,4.7188,4.5475,5.195,0.0713,0.9046,4.6375,1.2543,2.0405,0.4009,1.4197,2.3939,2.5105,1.7054,0.0489,2.7378,4.4861,0.0002,2.1392,1.1154,0.017,2.3092,5.395,0.003,4.3529,3.4531,3.5671,0.0027,7.453,1.7227,2.6318,4.5929,5.4704,2.6562,0.0002,4.7509,3.9643,0.7565,0.0205,0.1307,0.1923,0.0006,1.7205,0.1058,0.0554,0.0007,4.9002,0.2121,0.3654,5.5459,3.9177,3.4042,4.7006,5.244,0.229,0.669,0.0168,2.0214,6.1899,0.4118,3.4753,7.0612,3.2828,4.2037,6.9136,0.0058,0.2672,0.3745,0.0003,2.4887,5.2564,0.2755,0.0974,0.2517,5.7635,5.5548,0.0234,3.5287,3.3133,5.1441,5.5565,0.3709,4.981,5.7112,0.1774,0.8176,3.5419,5.1227,0.3555,0.0031,2.1522,7.1264,3.6078,2.3012,5.2617,3.7355,2.1388,3.2817,5.0902,0.2133,1.9878,1.2388,2.2402,9.0496,0.1661,1.6834,0.0002,3.4978,1.9655,0.1006,1.4077,4.2165,5.3795,2.2467,3.2029,2.9329,6.7592,1.4846,10.8143,2.4245,0.8064,3.4963,4.5631,1.196,3.5324,0.0024,4.2088,3.053,2.4055,0.9222,3.7392,4.8434,2.0234,1.881,0.5773,2.327,6.5113,0.8193,0.0064,2.2871,4.5049,1.2126,3.7312,5.6114,2.0027,1.7492,5.1813,0.0072,4.8868,0.5202,1.7715,3.7809,0.6326,3.0373,2.6673,0.8378,0.1465,5.3685,6.48,9.4045,9.2322,0.9129,0.0002,6.1586,4.997,0.0444,1.0662,0.5806,0.0002,2.6673,0.0246,13.9324,8.3681,3.4563,3.6714,5.2812,0.009,0.0046,0.001,0.9667,4.0956,3.5829,0.1901,4.1789,0.5461,1.1157,2.4885,5.7106,0.1551,1.6212,7.2393,2.4444,4.119,6.0772,0.0044,1.6368,1.0158,0.8939,2.4422,3.8937,0.818,0.0378,0.9553,3.8267,4.6188,0.2838,2.8829,2.8163,9.6791,3.8252,1.0638,5.9029,6.1529,0.0315,0.8428,2.8262,0.0339,1.6401,4.359,3.3619,2.0259,0.5495,2.1393,1.372,4.03,0.0005,2.8171,3.0076,1.3985,1.6652,3.754,0.0564,1.19,1.1583,6.1409,1.9784,7.4278,0.001,8.1638,0.0839,0.0397,3.899,2.1845,3.1048,7.1733,2.7947,0.2041,0.0001,0.7849,4.06,2.9747,9.061,5.923,1.8005,3.2987,1.498,1.8552,6.1714,3.2496,1.0258,1.2106,0.2625,0.5805,0.0002,5.3883,1.7174,4.3458,4.2057,0.7653,8.0785,8.4756,1.9177,4.9243,0.1868,0.3988,1.5516,1.4462,8.1229,2.156,1.5025,0.4999,5.365,2.3027,2.3364,7.1887,0.0134,4.6169,2.1466,0.7729,1.6909,6.5263,0.6713,3.1849,1.651,2.5367,3.5465,6.7427,5.2555,0.4164,4.6551,2.4643,5.974,0.4674,2.6118,9.7607,0.5264]}

Dubrovnik was sailed to Taranto in southern Italy on 27 April 1941, where she was turned over to the British a month later.\n\nAlfred G. Varian, Jr. purchased the Varian-Boulton submarine from the British government in June 1942 for use in the Atlantic. Dubrovnik had lost power during a typhoon in the South China Sea, and was scuttled in the Java Sea.\n\nThe SS Dubrovnik was originally called the SS Duoruviktivik and was put into service by the Soviet Baltic Fleet (then part of the Red Army) as the submarine tender and training boat Duoruviktivik. After the defeat of the Red Army on 21 June 1941 she was purchased by Admiral Giovanni Battista Varian of the Royal Navy as L-24 under a British flag.\n\nDubrovnik was in service as both a British submarine tender and a training boat in World War II. During the war she escorted convoys in the Southern Atlantic and, as such, frequently came into contact with and attacked German U-Boats. In the second half of 1945 she briefly sailed as a British auxiliary landing ship, landing troops at various ports as part of the invasion of the Far East. In 1952 she transferred to the United States Navy. She completed her third NATO patrol as the USNS Dubrovnik (T-AKE 20), and was paid off at Norfolk on 21 July 1954. Since then she has become a historic exhibit at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nU.S. Naval War College Review, Spring 2008.\n\nBattle Honour Losses\n\nExternal links\nUSS Dubrovnik Online Ship Photos\nUS Navy Photos","token_len":387,"entropy":[11.8353,8.4023,11.0911,0.7926,0.1075,1.4255,2.0446,8.5108,0.0253,5.3601,5.1105,2.5173,4.901,2.4284,3.2118,9.4672,7.3866,2.4946,1.3827,9.4804,0.9667,9.9244,7.9515,7.7786,0.0176,1.3487,5.0733,1.188,3.2702,0.0006,0.002,1.0166,9.2711,0.9373,9.2716,0.8275,2.2295,6.1153,0.4894,1.3799,3.7699,1.0737,0.8201,1.4581,1.4331,0.2269,0.6735,6.2251,0.3058,0.0848,0.6914,3.1541,7.5038,1.6634,0.0403,0.4923,2.0949,0.0193,3.918,4.8316,0.527,5.0481,2.0332,5.7104,6.2865,1.7045,4.2924,0.9576,8.2652,1.1616,6.5409,0.5747,3.6606,3.014,6.9631,3.5194,5.0773,1.8129,1.5745,1.8883,5.8768,0.7624,4.2244,1.5301,2.3264,6.3411,0.7766,1.1328,5.5315,2.214,5.6522,0.001,0.002,3.1254,6.3435,5.2664,2.7306,2.0183,5.7205,0.0149,1.2199,2.3316,4.6475,3.2658,0.013,2.1764,1.0716,1.576,8.1268,0.0591,0.0069,1.986,1.5284,6.7821,0.3806,1.7205,2.0028,0.0002,2.1216,5.8617,5.025,0.0039,0.0051,1.3338,4.6616,4.3359,1.4241,4.2289,6.4193,6.1722,9.5358,3.5559,5.8256,3.2652,1.7991,3.6059,0.984,7.053,0.807,0.1498,2.1324,0.9609,4.918,6.7193,0.3376,3.6573,4.82,3.5559,0.0017,0.2788,4.3861,0.096,1.3468,3.7388,1.7351,3.9147,10.3344,5.1481,6.488,3.9704,7.6842,0.2489,1.1613,0.1573,0.2076,0.0254,0.1212,1.3879,4.3797,1.358,5.6605,0.0866,0.4156,1.9176,0.0118,2.8439,3.7372,2.6238,0.3148,4.8792,0.3069,6.2397,0.2892,6.0717,8.3315,4.8198,0.8414,4.4381,0.4957,2.3965,0.6537,3.2044,0.4834,2.2754,8.9012,3.0646,4.164,5.877,3.9493,4.3128,6.4152,0.6841,1.2051,0.0002,4.2335,0.0012,0.0048,0.7548,4.8973,1.7345,2.502,5.194,0.5707,5.7504,2.274,2.8803,0.1515,2.6931,1.0804,0.5229,2.7385,5.6414,0.0058,0.2771,0.4217,3.3788,0.8775,0.6931,0.5353,6.826,4.7543,0.0073,4.9304,1.4506,5.1282,4.0244,1.7666,4.8699,2.8464,4.2684,0.0426,7.1798,4.7546,2.064,0.4264,0.004,5.6704,3.2089,2.6573,6.4797,0.0395,6.2853,0.0111,0.5353,2.6261,2.0004,5.6232,0.3116,0.0016,3.6658,0.9196,7.4878,3.9913,3.814,0.5645,3.9783,5.8642,7.9227,1.5161,1.6655,6.6107,7.487,2.0277,6.0768,1.6326,4.647,2.6779,0.0005,0.8553,5.4351,0.5637,1.6813,4.6189,0.0348,0.3734,2.4131,5.314,0.4753,6.6139,0.2233,0.4729,4.6697,0.3064,4.9003,2.3803,2.2928,6.2806,0.8946,6.217,9.6974,3.8198,5.1332,2.3868,5.0299,4.3044,3.2983,0.0083,0.0208,3.5964,4.8969,2.4149,5.9909,9.9026,6.9845,3.4136,1.5973,1.4796,6.9609,4.8494,3.5933,5.1785,2.2005,3.8189,2.2553,2.6143,0.386,6.2566,1.7037,0.6044,0.1938,5.2555,0.995,8.5506,9.4737,1.708,3.9849,4.0841,0.2675,7.4176,0.0022,0.0001,0.8453,1.6379,0.4924,0.5018,0.0003,5.4256,0.8727,0.0005,6.1891,0.9166,0.0004,5.5919,0.376,0.0419,0.0469,0.9281,4.0382,0.4219,8.6751,0.9251,5.9992,5.7141,1.1742,0.9171,0.0003,8.5956,10.2428,11.2097,0.5879,3.5932,0.0004,7.8553,0.6801,0.7576,30.2594,0.3674,0.0045,0.0031,10.2821,8.1705,6.1642,1.2618,21.5266,2.137,6.6437]}
{"id":3083,"ended":true,"length":343,"text":"As the existing supply of M2A3 gun shields was insufficient to meet requirements for the production of the M3, the Ordnance Department developed the M5 gun shield, which replaced the M2A3. The new shield was designed to meet new requirements of higher production volumes, a stronger gun and improved ammunition supply. The shield was fitted on the Model of 1943 Vickers Medium Gun by converting the gun shield receiver and mounting the M5 gun mount on top.\n\nBy the time the M5 gun shield was adopted by the Army, it was apparent that the existing supply of M5 shields could not supply the British Army because by this time M5 gun shields were manufactured in quantity in France. The Ordnance Department then ordered an M6 gun shield from the Vickers Company to cater for the British requirements. The M6 gun shield was designed by the Vickers Gun Shield Division, and its development involved the redesigning of parts of a Vickers medium gun shield. Improvements made to the Vickers gun shields include the mounting and attaching of the gun shield to both the receiver and mount, mounting of the gun shield mount on a solid floor, additional mounting of the gun shield mount on the gun shield receiver for increased strength of the attachment and to improve the fire control and stability of the gun shield. The development of the M6 gun shield included the use of a gas-charged spring in the gun shield mount which gave less recoil when firing heavy ammunition. The final development of the M6 gun shield was its adoption on the Centurion Mk IV by the Army.\n\nM6 gun shield\n\nThe development of the M6 gun shield to meet the British requirements eventually included the adoption of the new gun shield on the Centurion tank.\n\nThe new tank was designed to provide a vehicle with heavy armour protection capable of resisting tank-on-tank fire and was also equipped with a 75-mm gun.","token_len":387,"entropy":[2.9307,9.2757,6.6874,1.0781,6.7594,3.4081,4.5682,1.0069,7.6906,8.3926,2.7683,3.8373,1.0484,2.7121,5.5929,0.9718,2.0292,4.6119,0.1833,2.1231,1.9984,2.7,1.7035,1.0222,6.6953,0.0154,1.5684,3.3468,1.97,2.2451,5.3272,4.087,0.3487,1.8102,0.7963,4.7837,0.2632,1.3964,1.4025,0.1756,0.4848,2.2879,1.2634,3.1157,1.1075,1.2566,1.9927,0.4699,3.2577,5.3083,0.8724,2.8696,7.3267,3.924,3.1232,1.6031,4.2506,6.0699,3.7054,3.733,3.0238,3.576,5.361,0.5635,1.2199,2.3662,0.852,4.8279,4.1215,1.2844,6.3531,7.8996,8.1876,6.8049,1.6719,7.5824,4.7597,5.5265,8.7032,0.9036,3.1725,3.2209,8.239,2.9375,4.9038,2.4889,2.548,2.1909,2.0834,3.9837,2.3609,4.4042,3.0036,2.0895,0.0066,5.1124,1.3221,1.9407,0.7521,1.7543,1.5876,1.5374,0.3847,0.2742,3.7888,1.4261,0.2631,2.582,1.4028,2.021,0.7096,7.5626,0.1941,0.6954,4.0743,2.4111,0.2547,0.4184,4.2292,5.1907,2.9169,0.156,5.1525,0.5682,8.9411,1.8935,5.1942,7.2573,3.5939,0.2025,4.3671,1.8415,2.4632,0.5934,0.6625,5.7866,1.5893,5.8017,3.7752,3.7383,1.1034,1.4478,2.8093,0.0003,0.1044,3.685,4.3923,3.3546,2.6332,3.0426,1.3305,0.0208,3.3644,1.3237,5.418,0.0157,4.1742,2.9161,8.0761,0.8915,0.64,3.036,5.1172,0.7013,1.2205,1.3858,0.1108,1.3668,0.0274,0.51,3.0791,2.2219,1.3694,2.25,0.0028,6.0267,6.2803,5.1811,1.9537,2.0975,4.078,5.048,5.3291,1.2854,5.3461,2.1234,0.1266,6.2496,1.2992,3.9055,4.4343,0.0033,4.4838,1.2827,0.9787,2.1218,8.9499,4.4712,0.5342,0.1765,2.1957,0.0008,2.9023,4.7016,5.4678,1.2794,5.1133,2.7281,5.5059,0.0646,0.7561,2.2456,1.4045,1.6775,6.0043,1.0964,2.8271,0.1334,4.2415,1.0651,5.1175,1.0598,0.2569,0.6602,0.1345,4.8483,1.2146,2.6438,6.2305,6.2833,1.3277,6.4749,1.5169,0.6096,0.1594,0.3936,0.0281,2.9519,0.6997,0.9815,1.9477,1.3606,3.7237,4.7526,4.3534,3.0636,2.2705,0.4039,7.9812,1.9518,5.1583,2.7307,1.0039,5.1839,0.693,2.8922,3.6772,0.2221,0.0771,0.475,0.2645,0.4525,1.249,5.8269,0.1323,0.3298,1.3545,0.2684,0.4404,0.0135,4.7757,1.0681,3.4826,0.0114,1.6823,7.2541,1.8094,4.8795,5.4082,3.7795,0.6925,1.4127,0.2238,3.1729,3.0881,5.4152,6.0713,1.8748,3.1531,0.9016,6.551,2.7296,0.5362,1.0336,6.2691,3.2009,0.3593,0.0827,0.4453,0.0764,0.3472,0.005,0.6608,4.547,5.2113,3.9696,0.5658,8.3585,0.1383,4.0774,3.1191,3.8008,0.3152,2.9538,1.0965,0.8342,0.0002,3.7266,2.1776,1.289,0.5972,2.1597,0.0002,0.718,5.1801,0.0446,0.1421,0.3204,0.0515,0.1282,0.0033,6.179,0.7404,0.6508,1.295,0.8594,6.5269,4.2464,0.7609,5.3339,0.0339,0.9053,3.0629,3.4432,0.1624,2.6972,0.2374,1.1857,0.001,7.7799,1.5248,3.4876,0.0001,0.9519,2.9416,5.3446,1.1068,2.2769,1.1473,3.1586,1.7122,6.2137,2.619,5.9838,2.208,2.328,5.4987,0.0059,3.7069,5.5951,2.7373,5.3291,0.324,0.0364,0.4743,2.01,2.9501,3.7478,1.6951,0.0095,0.9123,7.1802,3.3103,0.2905,1.3976,1.5467]}

Because of this, sphingolipids are regarded as potential drug targets for the treatment of pain.\n\nThe sphingoid base is also called the core, while the one-, two-, and three-carbon chains are called chain heads. One chain terminates with the sphingosine group and the other two end in a glycine group. The sphingosine is part of the sphingoid base and acts as a signal to a cell to make choline available as a precursor for further biosynthesis. The chain heads and termini can be varied, both to enhance or diminish the effects of the sphingoid base.\n\nInhibiting the activity of a receptor can cause a conformational change in the receptor, increasing and decreasing interactions with the signal and regulatory proteins, respectively.\n\nProteins that have a Gq-type GPCR-GSHp1 or -GSHp2 structure are more sensitive to the interaction of sphingolipids with their Cys residues than proteins that do not have such a GPCR-GSHp1 or -GSHp2 structure.

{"id":3922,"ended":true,"length":349,"text":"Like many of his Victorian contemporaries, Rider Haggard `` proceeds on the assumption that whites are naturally superior to blacks, and that Britain's imperial extensions into Africa are a noble, civilising force that will, if allowed to continue, ultimately bring liberation to the blacks -- \"progress, not progressivity.\" It is this assumption that has allowed Haggard to be, if not `` an outright racist,'' at least a willing racist, and the reason he so perfectly fits with the attitudes of the period. If Haggard, like many other Victorians, was a racist, and like many other Victorians, he was an imperialist, one can only imagine what kind of a racist he would have written if he had lived in the black power era.\n\nWhen it was first published in 1885, Ragged Dick was described as Dickens's `` latest and strangest creation \" and the `` most un-Dickensian effort \" he had made yet. Even in his own time, the novel had been subjected to severe criticism both for its subject matter and for its style. It has also been suggested that Dickens was uncomfortable with the way his characters were developing, or had developed, their own, independent and often destructive personality. In Ragged Dick the central character, Dick Turpin, is one of several vagabonds, fugitives from justice as well as from society. Dick is described as `` a free-and-easy vagrant \" who wanders `` about the country \" and `` makes his way by hard work and a little luck \" ( 4). This is an ironic description given Dickens's own experience as a vagabond and the frequent descriptions of a desperate and often criminal existence in 19th-century fiction. However Haggard is not concerned with Dickens's concerns with this kind of poverty ; it is Haggard's own brand of romantic individualism that underlies all his writing including the novel.","token_len":387,"entropy":[6.4694,2.1522,3.4944,11.2549,2.097,0.2232,10.96,7.0552,1.5575,0.0531,13.9455,16.7477,4.3633,1.2529,4.311,0.1019,10.109,1.5751,5.3482,3.542,0.3534,1.0553,1.5968,1.0852,0.6862,10.5764,2.444,7.647,12.4754,4.2185,1.9964,2.3524,2.4643,7.854,3.8597,6.0094,3.775,5.0343,2.5415,1.8602,4.7381,2.1772,4.0687,0.2068,1.9623,0.4213,5.8325,3.4046,7.616,0.5965,0.898,5.0003,8.3951,7.1651,7.637,4.1116,2.5922,3.6093,8.2923,1.1202,3.9156,0.6504,3.1219,2.482,0.3129,2.4628,4.7336,2.8625,0.0028,0.0011,0.5065,3.8577,5.0472,4.7392,0.725,12.0542,4.2697,6.3395,2.1381,1.5711,2.8168,0.1016,1.2876,6.429,5.6244,2.1337,2.0162,3.4219,5.0043,1.4742,5.1286,7.0495,3.4939,2.9201,1.0847,6.8268,0.337,1.5564,6.0897,0.9376,5.0961,2.5284,0.0011,0.0019,3.5944,1.7227,1.5197,2.2435,8.1507,0.0063,0.3273,2.1276,2.2336,2.3183,0.3921,3.4482,4.8241,0.8197,1.4335,2.7124,0.001,0.6109,0.6741,1.246,3.1825,4.5062,0.3637,5.3882,2.9905,1.1504,2.313,1.9667,3.3086,0.0062,2.8045,1.7853,0.7124,0.5883,1.0938,7.2922,3.6867,0.3861,0.6949,2.8045,0.747,1.6561,7.6972,7.2242,4.5565,0.873,2.5098,0.0721,4.8978,3.232,3.4528,3.4889,1.2293,0.7981,1.4897,3.8439,0.2469,5.8801,7.0652,7.9985,1.9166,3.896,0.5061,9.0825,1.3618,2.9161,9.483,4.0268,6.4448,0.0066,5.5809,7.4832,2.7056,2.8271,3.5831,1.9961,6.2274,2.4845,5.3585,2.372,0.0308,6.4163,4.2016,3.7505,0.9161,3.9203,3.5539,1.253,5.187,2.9335,1.4578,2.9852,2.6855,0.302,2.8177,3.6867,2.1995,1.3071,5.9135,0.0571,6.2668,0.3915,5.2492,1.3827,0.3159,5.2847,0.3553,0.1204,0.8634,0.1319,4.1698,0.6198,2.5165,3.7147,3.9388,0.4622,6.2908,0.3574,3.8858,1.5732,7.99,0.2315,0.8978,3.4884,2.7221,2.8486,1.0813,9.878,1.7559,2.9894,4.0709,2.9452,0.9797,1.5675,2.3626,5.8503,5.7253,4.5058,4.386,5.3571,3.0762,0.7701,2.4957,5.3382,0.0187,0.0054,3.116,5.9467,0.449,1.3154,6.2359,12.5115,0.579,0.1949,1.0834,4.3539,0.1635,4.1554,8.937,0.3815,0.2402,2.568,8.1087,0.0114,1.4352,3.1434,6.4645,1.2573,0.0055,4.0305,3.8829,2.8428,5.9474,1.6025,3.0934,0.3081,2.3604,1.1629,7.3685,1.4794,7.5339,0.1176,2.5886,6.6912,2.7542,2.8374,1.3231,6.7028,0.0003,8.513,5.1474,1.9948,2.8209,3.8099,2.6088,3.7342,5.7712,2.6684,1.9883,3.9025,7.7342,1.3653,0.7715,3.1897,4.0276,2.0262,2.742,2.6752,9.6278,2.629,3.2121,1.5524,3.0111,5.0284,2.2139,3.4157,4.6891,0.3267,2.8242,3.4713,1.8732,0.3421,2.3714,0.015,0.0066,2.3471,1.9313,6.7521,5.1965,0.3361,4.4594,7.8739,2.3912,4.0014,5.3636,5.2687,1.2045,8.7824,0.0068,1.0076,0.0911,6.3683,0.6211,4.4772,7.4568,0.0287,0.0009,3.06,1.917,4.7871,0.4146,2.0793,0.5071,8.1178,1.6358,4.7657,4.2249,0.0005,7.5531,8.9599,3.5888,0.2243,4.7354,0.0015,0.0009,0.3576,3.0541,10.1698,0.0255,7.282,8.4753,0.0137,1.0574,5.8042,1.0155,3.6639,1.3751,3.1258,8.5476,1.8077,2.8035,0.6309]}

She studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John, and successfully auditioned for Sujoy Ghosh's fantasy film Aladin (2009), which became the highest-grossing Hindi production of the year. She also starred, along with Amitabh Bachchan, in two Tamil films, Maattrraan (2010) and Thani Oruvan (2011), for which she received Filmfare Awards for Best Actress and Best Female Debut, respectively. In 2011, she co-starred with Salman Khan in the erotic thriller Bodyguards & Goons. In 2012, she featured in the critically acclaimed film Dev.D, which received the National Film Award for Best Original Screenplay. The following year she starred in the romantic drama Kahaani, to widespread critical acclaim. She then essayed the role of a pregnant woman who goes on to murder a rapist in the erotic thriller O Meri Kasam (2013). She then appeared in Ghajini (2012), which became a phenomenon at the Indian box office.In 2013 she also signed on to star in a biopic on Indian independence activist Subhash Chandra Bose. She was subsequently seen in the historical film Padmavati (2017), which was later postponed to 2018; however, following the release of the film's trailer in January 2018, protests broke out in protest of an alleged romantic scene between the title character, Padmavati, and Alauddin Khilji, which allegedly insulted the valour of Rani Padmini. During the protests, several threats and attempts were made to vandalise film production facilities and film-related equipment. According to the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, these actions are a violation of the Information & Broadcasting Act, 1957. Her other upcoming projects include Dabangg 3 (2019), Bharat (2019), and Tadap (2019).","token_len":387,"entropy":[8.4153,0.191,11.1913,5.6056,0.2029,4.8188,1.7947,1.1811,8.8454,4.05,1.3104,2.7327,5.0999,6.0976,5.6228,1.4338,5.1697,0.0225,0.0324,8.0772,1.1091,7.4441,7.7355,2.6489,1.5198,7.8758,3.9792,0.0023,0.1548,9.2154,7.4101,5.0263,0.095,0.9615,7.6734,1.7889,7.3385,8.2273,3.9156,3.0043,1.2684,1.1892,4.3185,1.5902,3.4473,0.8933,0.0257,0.0004,4.7912,5.7416,0.6984,1.9691,0.1107,0.5925,2.1462,1.6454,1.9944,7.2406,2.7626,0.003,5.7111,0.0685,0.0147,0.0503,0.0068,0.7267,0.8636,4.5773,5.9319,0.8087,0.9211,6.2504,16.4223,5.0389,4.3384,1.8331,1.5636,0.6262,0.0173,5.0468,5.0298,7.7274,5.6778,6.7487,1.3281,0.197,1.4723,4.3909,0.2322,0.1298,1.5743,9.3996,3.5133,3.0504,2.5438,0.6327,1.3076,1.7171,0.3847,6.0466,7.8852,0.3373,3.4565,1.3116,0.1406,2.1391,1.7397,0.0747,0.5815,3.3546,0.0187,0.2858,0.0052,1.1167,4.9607,0.4801,0.7614,1.2651,8.2931,1.2106,9.0723,4.5999,7.993,7.4062,1.9642,1.6541,1.7443,0.8657,0.0648,0.2956,6.5862,0.5366,0.8569,4.206,0.3589,1.8833,7.3164,4.5907,7.0094,4.251,0.8768,2.6263,2.5457,4.9675,1.3397,1.0551,0.4715,0.2894,3.6401,1.0263,0.007,0.7371,4.2755,2.472,0.0225,2.4068,1.5982,0.4094,0.8102,4.7435,1.9363,4.99,7.35,6.4952,1.6641,6.449,10.4573,2.8142,0.1859,0.7205,1.8746,4.5044,15.6957,0.1171,2.7906,4.8001,0.2091,2.8827,6.2943,1.7922,3.0877,3.9034,1.2685,2.0968,5.1774,2.0811,6.3687,1.6178,1.6531,7.4574,0.979,5.1989,10.1738,2.3976,9.4161,3.0699,1.7503,0.9783,0.6005,1.8313,3.4826,2.3754,0.3895,8.9266,4.7302,6.9978,2.2602,3.2172,0.468,1.793,2.8718,1.5678,6.6338,4.5582,0.217,4.4865,2.4361,0.0338,0.5908,5.6678,1.2042,2.9239,3.6003,5.2846,1.0382,0.9815,1.3058,0.2251,2.3358,4.8874,0.0269,2.6908,4.2838,7.2058,2.2178,6.2574,1.5611,2.1694,0.4152,0.006,1.2634,1.4423,2.3088,4.8344,4.1124,0.4993,1.3197,8.7629,3.0718,7.5893,1.9161,0.3575,0.5478,1.0663,4.687,0.7793,0.7022,1.6763,5.1327,8.3959,2.6983,2.7236,6.3842,2.5106,0.0612,5.6229,1.3745,1.3685,0.0563,1.1145,0.9243,3.3297,3.6858,2.1252,3.0284,1.8977,0.076,8.7368,2.8192,0.0025,1.1364,4.7785,1.8268,5.4608,3.0087,8.5309,6.2474,0.4788,1.3582,9.4651,0.0462,3.1319,5.2847,0.5629,0.0032,0.0093,1.3234,0.0667,7.9826,6.7007,0.1963,3.4488,4.443,1.4473,1.2059,3.7039,4.9679,7.3065,1.1188,11.0639,0.8415,0.1419,7.531,3.3907,5.9115,4.3793,1.0013,4.6195,0.7005,3.5083,0.1649,4.0191,8.6987,2.355,5.2565,0.6345,0.0208,0.7619,6.5328,0.7191,5.0421,2.9778,2.4458,1.61,3.0725,3.4269,2.2993,2.6846,0.7128,4.5621,0.0012,1.7975,6.437,0.0618,2.6491,3.4099,0.2542,0.4925,5.2363,2.107,3.4997,3.6008,1.8254,0.0127,0.7721,4.381,6.482,0.0838,0.1922,1.3192,4.8376,1.2836,6.0154,5.6806,7.9115,2.2816,0.1866,6.0845,4.7403,2.3508,6.4388,10.984,1.1733,5.4357,0.4187,7.2223,0.3934,4.0258,2.2966,0.3713,1.5638,9.4137,4.5932,2.7768,1.1922,0.2796]}
{"id":2166,"ended":true,"length":289,"text":"The Amylostereaceae are white rot pathogens. They disintegrate the lignin of the host wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal colonization takes place on the surface of the wood. Once the growth stage is attained, the wood dies and is removed from the host (Bergman et al., 1987). Several of these pathogens possess fungal endophytes (i.e., mycelium that grows within the host wood ). In some cases, endophytes of multiple pathogenic strains and genera are observed (Harding, 1979). Recently, new endophytes of one of the Amylostereaceae were also reported (Diaz-Ramirez, 1992a; Diaz-Ramirez et al., 1994) as well as endophytes of several pathogenic members of other tree diseases (Harding et al., 1985; Nijssen et al., 1987; Lopes-Costa et al., 1988; Fournier et al., 1990; Korsmeyer et al., 1991; Garcia-Jauffret et al., 1992; Souto et al., 1993; Garcia-Jauffret et al., 1996). Most of the endophytes of Amylostereaceae are located within the secondary cell structure, within lignin cells as well as in the intercellular spaces. In addition to isolating specific endophytes from affected areas, various fungal genomes have been sequenced (Soumis et al., 1993; Soumis et al., 1994; Chen et al., 1995; Caulino et al., 1996; Koo et al., 1996; Schmachtenberg et al., 1997; Dias B.A. and Dias P.C., 1998; Dias P.C. and Dias B.A., 1999).","token_len":387,"entropy":[8.7843,6.1671,9.3198,7.113,9.1739,2.4345,7.6194,9.2831,10.5667,2.0145,1.5008,12.2057,0.0044,4.5613,5.6179,1.1889,0.1756,4.202,2.0265,5.4529,6.8924,1.6932,9.262,1.5826,7.1021,2.307,1.1666,7.6949,2.2895,5.7694,4.369,0.913,6.1534,3.7424,12.0562,0.0345,4.0816,1.1985,1.6557,5.1233,9.5717,4.6752,4.2568,8.294,0.0073,8.4224,3.8205,0.0397,4.985,0.5946,3.0714,0.4169,0.1662,1.6391,1.0098,4.7264,1.0945,6.1176,4.4366,0.7984,5.6753,0.2292,0.8274,2.6343,4.0597,1.5212,2.2794,3.9821,0.5358,0.202,1.8765,6.2969,5.8718,4.0536,2.488,1.7486,0.0036,0.4741,4.0715,0.4919,6.2267,3.5652,1.2761,2.9558,7.6161,7.0516,0.0001,7.6893,1.2029,0.7059,1.7234,5.557,0.0046,0.0006,0.1453,5.8391,1.4374,0.4531,5.2041,3.9096,3.9132,0.772,1.4717,1.1841,8.7029,3.1574,2.4394,0.7197,0.2216,6.519,0.0124,0.1393,4.9038,6.6934,3.7689,0.4903,3.3468,4.4665,5.7306,0.001,1.3008,5.0252,1.5551,3.9367,6.064,1.8307,4.1114,1.0881,6.6018,0.111,6.0751,4.8124,0.0154,0.3238,1.4248,5.6404,1.8849,0.6479,5.3691,0.0088,0.0447,0.0566,0.5153,2.3233,5.5896,2.4238,1.2151,4.2355,3.751,3.9997,5.1754,1.6944,1.8892,3.668,3.6605,1.7048,5.0585,0.0835,0.1044,0.0072,0.4868,0.0006,0.0142,2.4064,4.0004,4.1274,2.3715,0.0789,5.1319,0.0167,0.1265,0.2582,1.901,3.0117,0.0213,7.1869,0.1685,5.1312,6.222,4.0435,0.862,2.9743,0.1167,0.9257,0.0004,0.0315,3.3743,0.766,5.9083,4.3422,4.8886,1.5219,0.7545,0.001,0.0135,3.0063,0.7786,4.8033,5.0802,3.3177,7.5184,0.9121,0.5329,0.0003,0.0127,2.0775,0.6572,5.2682,4.3276,0.036,0.2962,0.0013,0.0272,2.2901,0.7577,4.517,5.7995,6.0567,0.2478,0.0007,0.0173,1.8037,0.6565,6.6506,0.7745,4.6497,7.028,5.5514,9.4718,0.723,0.0009,0.0324,1.3987,0.812,4.417,5.6665,2.4514,0.2271,0.0006,0.0212,1.3964,0.6338,5.0189,0.1715,0.215,0.0092,0.0019,0.0186,0.0685,0.0021,0.107,2.8628,0.9508,5.1179,0.9126,0.609,2.5129,0.0111,0.1794,0.8005,1.6973,0.0035,0.0021,0.0065,0.1056,0.9872,5.0444,2.104,0.8605,7.8959,6.0799,6.4813,2.4599,6.8891,6.9808,0.5933,0.0676,5.271,6.2784,0.3223,0.0867,1.2533,0.8861,5.2361,0.6335,0.005,4.8205,2.5074,2.5525,1.623,1.4453,7.4115,0.1515,5.1581,1.5413,0.0092,0.109,2.6107,6.829,4.9115,0.3682,4.9237,3.8772,0.0001,7.185,2.0045,0.2709,1.6994,0.0007,1.8704,3.4313,4.2977,9.4081,0.7102,0.0007,0.0091,2.9268,0.4553,4.9661,0.0364,0.2614,0.0008,0.0383,1.151,0.5678,6.853,0.2508,0.0005,0.0101,1.3486,0.476,4.6259,4.8115,7.6901,0.1677,0.0005,0.015,0.8034,0.5078,4.5772,5.3687,0.4641,0.0009,0.0289,1.8441,0.4566,5.6595,3.7536,4.7937,4.7798,1.9423,0.0505,0.0009,0.0164,0.6952,0.4061,4.6411,5.2085,11.2299,4.0537,7.0387,0.8099,2.3818,3.2279,1.3365,3.861,0.0506,2.8773,1.4885,1.1306,0.5171,3.3528,0.3439,2.9864,0.1162,0.7832,2.3194,0.3458,0.6035,0.0917,2.5241,0.0019,0.4531,0.3446,0.5873,1.3018]}
{"id":1942,"ended":true,"length":345,"text":"The 130th Engineer Brigade traces its lineage to the 1303rd Engineer General Service Regiment which saw action in World War II. The regiment was activated on 15 July 1943 at Camp Ellis, Illinois. The regiment was transferred to Camp Gordon, Georgia on 1 January 1944. Then on 11 February the regiment was transferred to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. The regiment shipped out to England in late March 1944, arriving at Chatham on 23 April.\n\nBy the time the brigade had arrived on the continent on 24 April, it was fighting in the Ardennes and fought in battles as far south as Vire on 4 June. In later engagements it fought in the Hurtgen Forest as part of the 7th Army before advancing to Munster on the eastern banks of the Rhine and was transferred to the 11th Army as part of the panzer thrust towards Holland. In late August it crossed the Rhine and advanced further towards the Netherlands. By December the regiment was near Haersel, ready to advance into Germany.\n\nOnce in Germany both companies served with the 506th Infantry Regiment. The regiment was attached to the 505th PIR in March 1944 and was stationed in southern Germany until June of that same year. From July 1944 to January 1945 the unit took part in Operation LIVETTA which saw Allied troops liberate the city of Munich. The regiment was disbanded on 1 July 1945.\n\nDuring WWII six Soldiers of the 1303rd EGGR were awarded the Medal of Honor. In addition one Soldier who served in the unit was awarded the Cross of Valour.\n\nThe 1303rd EGGR served in the combat zones of both World Wars (WWI & WW2) and participated in the occupation of Germany after the end of the second World War. The regiment was disbanded on 1 July 1945 at Camp Kilmer and most of the men of the unit were transferred to the 2nd Infantry Division.","token_len":387,"entropy":[10.8277,3.8702,7.1241,4.2589,11.76,0.4657,2.5102,1.3151,0.661,6.5641,5.5368,1.373,1.1217,7.1783,6.6172,2.8779,4.3973,5.8459,1.9766,0.7009,2.3296,0.0062,0.8553,0.7254,1.6874,2.3463,1.1138,7.5615,1.9564,4.2951,2.661,2.3268,3.7479,4.4554,8.6663,1.265,4.3457,1.131,1.5625,1.2294,1.104,4.415,0.1502,2.3984,6.9169,0.9326,4.155,1.2291,3.454,2.6028,0.2238,0.7273,6.9509,1.0582,4.004,1.913,3.2393,0.9449,0.8959,1.6732,0.1138,0.8089,7.0878,2.4725,0.3714,3.3175,1.7245,0.9287,1.5078,0.7435,8.7691,3.2408,1.0089,4.8867,2.3896,3.2631,2.5725,1.4495,2.371,2.8395,1.2853,6.031,0.6944,3.0988,3.6978,1.1373,0.4458,2.9077,0.0159,4.6681,1.5267,2.5452,0.7433,4.3822,3.3229,1.7405,3.2767,1.2546,3.657,2.8914,3.608,0.5431,1.0409,1.7381,1.1482,5.2968,1.2852,1.3918,4.2636,0.0148,2.3893,5.8745,1.5296,5.8754,4.6757,2.2976,1.7067,0.0151,5.4175,6.3019,5.8368,3.1886,1.9047,0.8949,2.9778,7.0714,4.1276,1.6402,2.381,0.6852,1.156,12.3494,7.8523,4.417,5.1334,2.3134,0.0008,0.5016,5.3008,0.2478,3.6405,7.7804,4.7414,0.8739,9.0154,0.1338,1.1092,4.8725,7.0358,5.7911,0.0702,0.0336,2.5957,0.0044,2.6399,5.0988,5.0459,0.1289,1.1788,4.814,0.0587,1.9484,4.5211,0.532,0.0007,0.1975,12.3318,0.5786,10.4266,8.1082,5.6293,1.333,2.31,3.2148,2.8823,1.63,4.3127,0.3085,0.9195,0.0086,1.5411,5.3267,4.35,3.7143,2.0523,2.6237,0.8251,3.2075,4.7283,1.9523,0.962,1.0548,6.4716,7.2154,4.0248,5.2209,2.2579,10.6811,0.4737,4.2422,3.0396,2.7747,0.6145,1.0681,0.0002,6.5115,1.7309,0.917,7.1527,4.717,6.3715,3.0409,0.8325,6.1807,2.1732,0.0062,2.3133,0.9908,2.053,1.5103,1.8387,1.1085,4.4533,0.0983,0.2272,7.4349,0.0035,8.8627,4.8189,2.4141,3.9108,0.8547,1.4282,1.5791,3.8518,1.2671,6.2508,1.2378,2.8896,3.8148,2.9095,1.5801,5.3358,0.0134,0.176,5.2356,2.5283,1.8725,1.0442,3.7092,0.1087,1.0463,2.7304,4.7564,0.3785,0.0195,3.439,5.5992,9.1203,3.4945,5.658,5.2652,2.2088,5.3183,1.8514,4.9342,1.6447,2.5311,0.0516,5.6271,1.0818,1.713,1.8125,1.0898,4.4414,0.9966,2.1033,2.4052,0.3198,1.0779,0.486,0.0002,3.7591,4.0987,7.3406,8.0546,1.6773,0.2845,3.2119,0.5326,0.3422,14.711,8.5771,2.0285,3.8952,0.4518,3.1778,0.0334,0.4159,1.4007,3.0276,3.1605,5.2962,4.2371,5.0254,1.0517,0.931,0.7973,4.3967,0.9875,0.6677,0.2561,4.2017,0.5507,3.7485,3.666,0.7884,0.9908,0.0002,2.1184,2.0274,0.2166,0.07,2.1528,0.0134,2.7254,0.987,1.2432,7.0814,3.9459,0.8145,3.8824,3.3777,0.489,4.5486,3.7077,2.0538,4.0632,2.3557,0.9098,0.6404,0.9618,4.0911,0.0672,1.3151,5.9852,0.2753,3.4203,5.4581,0.4675,2.1092,0.0017,1.0189,4.9902,2.5494,0.005,0.1587,1.5406,1.9404,0.7904,4.0703,0.8013,1.3388,1.2158,0.2028,4.914,2.756,4.0125,0.0167,3.1439,7.5911,0.3172,0.5269,3.6618,2.5647,0.135,1.5194,1.0432,2.3887,0.1,1.2582,5.2981,0.0682,1.6547,0.7019,0.8241]}

In 2000, the monoclonal antibody @ -Gvapil received FDA approval for relapsed AML, resulting in the \"first-in-class\" therapeutic, which is a monoclonal antibody-based, humanized monoclonal antibody (a mAb-HBXAb). The antibody is designed not to target the cancer directly, thus, allowing normal, healthy, non transformed, leukemia cells to proliferate and support the patient's body.\n\nIt makes sense that @-Gvapil is now also being administered in Europe ( the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products has begun evaluating a license request for its use as a hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy for relapsed AML ), with promising results being reported from trials in China. Unfortunately, @-Gvapil is too expensive and is not covered in North America. In that regard, the US National Cancer Institute (NCI ) recently awarded $3 million in Cancer Therapy Acceleration Partners (CTAP ) grant support to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC ) in New York.\n\n@-Gvapil is developed by GVA Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with MSKCC, with an FDA orphan drug designation. The grant will expand the use of @-Gvapil and its novel combination treatments for blood cancers, specifically, AML, MDS and multiple myeloma.\n\n\"It is important to identify promising treatment options for blood cancer patients and support the discovery and development of innovative research and development,\" said Dr. Joseph Pletcher, Director of Cancer Programs at NCI. \"A multi-disciplinary approach to funding this research will help advance the field.\"","token_len":388,"entropy":[6.1366,2.1173,9.6702,2.5033,7.7188,1.0821,2.1072,2.3401,5.0255,7.954,11.4699,7.4351,0.3365,3.3943,0.8732,2.9967,9.5859,1.3044,1.7146,0.0131,0.0008,0.0008,2.0001,0.0433,0.4232,1.9571,5.5136,4.4591,4.0286,3.6309,1.1511,1.0078,3.8797,0.7141,3.2608,6.9983,0.2037,2.0156,10.1583,1.3,0.0102,0.0008,0.2118,9.1014,8.6124,4.8925,5.0733,7.1205,6.8589,6.5378,3.8853,0.0575,1.118,7.4531,0.3061,0.3641,0.0037,1.7898,5.2005,0.008,1.8777,6.2009,4.5562,3.2578,3.3269,0.0886,2.0358,0.5336,3.8479,3.8181,1.4824,1.5874,3.0434,5.7943,0.0417,0.0005,0.0018,0.1089,5.7927,1.3009,3.6612,5.6776,2.4655,3.5082,0.0192,0.0007,0.0024,0.2186,2.5612,4.9616,5.8313,2.5932,3.0358,8.7633,5.0017,8.9973,2.8055,1.8318,3.4473,1.3078,3.4779,6.5989,0.7133,2.2954,1.998,6.5919,6.7256,0.4912,7.3707,3.8194,5.8413,8.1138,4.5876,1.9375,3.0155,3.4174,17.2391,4.153,6.6329,1.7065,0.2087,3.8335,0.0015,1.7384,6.3711,1.751,4.5487,0.6127,4.1699,0.9569,1.9732,0.0011,4.641,6.2307,0.4525,0.9627,4.6384,2.7901,0.0393,0.0173,0.0039,0.0024,2.6628,4.8131,5.0969,1.5575,4.9163,2.6256,5.3252,3.7208,9.1916,5.0577,4.7715,2.9075,0.1668,4.3085,1.2427,0.9184,4.6363,5.9883,2.624,4.376,5.1807,4.2388,6.6028,6.6011,0.6659,3.2147,3.2002,3.8774,0.6437,4.4173,0.0102,0.0307,0.0036,0.014,0.0023,0.2205,0.0143,0.3258,4.243,2.3671,2.977,0.0127,0.1745,0.002,4.2515,3.5663,6.3726,0.3408,4.8759,1.6327,4.0494,4.4401,0.756,4.2491,2.371,5.3181,0.0968,2.5886,0.0165,0.0017,0.0017,0.0035,0.0023,1.126,5.4986,1.3688,1.6091,3.2977,0.9253,6.2182,3.1903,6.7318,0.1546,1.1547,3.1631,4.9234,1.4444,0.039,2.1941,3.9291,4.6774,2.2808,0.006,1.1571,0.1516,0.0042,6.6829,2.5591,3.7615,2.7605,3.4119,1.7202,1.5478,7.8637,4.9574,7.9288,0.9555,7.0443,3.6391,1.1408,0.978,6.2577,2.0154,3.0756,0.8067,2.4997,9.6617,0.1326,1.2606,0.0025,0.0002,0.0001,0.0093,0.4332,1.1118,0.7222,0.386,0.1633,4.7755,2.0752,2.4901,0.1354,2.8191,1.3364,0.0003,4.5466,0.2702,0.0521,0.0109,0.0025,0.0031,1.0322,6.3833,1.4995,5.3932,6.5734,2.4013,0.401,2.4466,2.293,0.0027,6.2134,0.0582,0.025,1.8168,3.3775,3.744,3.9536,10.6302,1.9679,2.536,1.2163,1.6549,6.9456,2.8782,6.3813,1.3479,3.9047,0.0616,0.2102,0.0314,0.0032,0.0051,0.0029,0.0019,3.0055,2.5356,5.7645,4.277,5.1729,2.0169,6.8299,1.9382,1.4976,6.4966,3.0014,5.9353,0.0315,1.9101,5.0745,6.4878,1.9252,5.1982,0.9445,0.006,0.0227,0.6655,1.5038,0.0003,3.9118,3.6427,1.1855,1.987,0.4131,6.8841,4.4831,4.0305,1.2409,0.957,3.0796,1.1162,2.7416,2.2958,5.9627,1.965,5.5921,1.3282,0.9476,0.0081,4.2999,7.57,2.0042,1.1251,4.569,0.711,1.4525,0.1289,5.3044,3.9566,7.3481,0.1071,2.5504,0.3313,3.4889,5.4394,0.678,3.0046,0.0065,0.3669,0.1487,4.6009,5.4676,0.08,2.2691,1.5834,1.0083,5.8627,3.5955,1.5379,1.9844,1.9751,3.8845,1.2687,3.8367,3.9707]}

At this time a canal was being built around, so the town would also include the land occupied by. The grant in 1290 had been made before the first canal project was completed. The work to create the canal and the town, took place over a period of several years. The project included the construction of a harbour entrance in south, which was designed to be an anchor point for large river steam navies. At the same time another harbour entrance was constructed out of and up the rivers to the site known as,, which is just north of the river. With the construction of the new harbour entrance the land was probably included in the grant in1290.

{"id":4800,"ended":true,"length":314,"text":"In the ten years after the fall of Zaculeu various Spanish expeditions crossed into the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes and engaged in the gradual and complex conquest of the Chuj and Q 'anjob 'al. The conquests, which were often fought on foot, were a continuation of those of the previous century and were accompanied by a gradual erosion of the autonomy of their rulers, including the eventual loss of their royal status. ( )\n\nThe Spanish conquest of the Chuj peoples begins with Juan de O\u00f1ate and the Spanish conquest of New Mexico and continues in the 1510s with the conquest and subjugation of the Chuj of Southern Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nContents\n\nThe conquest of the Chuj had begun by the mid-15th century but had been slowed by the Spanish military presence in the region. The Spanish began by attempting to conquer the Chuj on their own but after failed campaigns turned to their allies, the Quichua. O\u00f1ate, who had been captured in the Battle of Coyotepec in 1486, returned to New Spain in 1501 eager to resume the conquest of South America.\n\nO\u00f1ate took command of expeditions against the Chuj in what is now Bolivia and Ecuador but in the 1510s he sought to reduce the strength of the allied forces. In 1511, the allies captured the Quichua emperor Tupac Amaru II in their lands and forced him to convert to Catholicism. On the battlefield, Tupac Amaru II's forces were defeated by the combined Spanish conquistadores and Ch'ocha auxiliaries. However, as with the Cusco campaign, the success of the combined Spanish-Chocha forces was short-lived as these campaigns were also plagued by the arrival of the Aztecs into the region. They were able to quickly over-power the alliance made with the Chocha.","token_len":388,"entropy":[2.6222,9.0721,0.8394,3.2071,0.966,4.9089,0.0639,14.4192,6.513,5.2778,13.143,7.5113,6.6908,0.0069,6.4455,3.4898,1.4107,6.0306,1.249,2.2907,3.3728,4.346,11.0221,8.0867,1.557,5.4051,0.4939,1.8059,7.7498,3.4162,6.0901,4.877,0.0529,0.6811,5.2351,8.3509,5.9151,8.1006,12.4909,6.6595,14.2957,5.9896,3.686,4.3437,1.8613,3.9224,0.383,3.3276,1.7503,1.7313,5.6069,5.3182,2.139,2.949,0.7212,1.0238,4.2933,4.2749,0.0682,3.5116,0.8895,0.361,3.0637,3.8587,2.6083,1.9144,4.1326,0.1161,1.6155,3.4095,5.7251,0.2092,0.5329,7.8635,0.2518,5.1406,5.665,2.2722,5.0688,0.7892,7.2141,4.1684,0.0104,1.788,5.9749,4.7908,0.5806,5.7255,7.2325,1.6128,0.1515,1.5744,2.9062,2.3223,0.3457,1.1813,1.1171,0.0436,10.3022,7.1052,1.1981,7.4957,1.111,5.5002,5.0894,3.904,3.1155,2.2121,3.7827,1.9737,0.069,5.9321,1.4308,2.8232,3.6307,3.0704,0.9097,6.1632,5.5468,0.2904,2.5223,0.489,1.6607,4.0921,4.0167,0.0036,0.0329,0.9149,2.3874,1.0714,4.4112,6.7969,5.8292,1.9994,6.1737,0.5553,2.2588,0.0003,5.9003,3.4542,0.0002,2.2479,2.9571,0.3544,0.7334,0.1212,0.016,5.6847,2.7698,3.8206,1.0115,5.5754,0.1875,1.5291,1.4189,0.0741,4.4526,3.8674,1.8149,6.2331,0.8409,0.76,2.9278,4.6201,4.4363,0.7955,0.7621,1.7912,0.9884,1.4378,2.6776,4.7277,2.9332,5.5819,0.1525,3.38,0.65,1.7871,0.0261,4.388,3.3266,0.764,4.2916,4.5864,7.5762,5.1369,7.7459,1.735,5.0668,5.0351,2.1327,1.405,5.6982,5.6406,4.5352,2.4357,6.7855,1.1507,0.0188,1.9658,1.8014,1.0787,1.5964,3.7687,1.7396,1.6337,4.2376,0.0132,8.2258,0.8064,6.8976,1.2692,2.9586,4.4862,0.4429,5.2208,0.3954,3.5342,6.7787,1.5469,1.1578,4.4684,10.1253,0.1561,5.5076,1.5492,1.4783,0.6782,6.6036,0.1957,0.5612,2.3978,0.0002,3.5038,0.1591,0.0054,4.5873,3.9107,0.2922,9.8094,0.0063,3.3411,0.5067,1.157,0.1057,1.7954,5.6924,1.0824,0.5358,3.8118,1.1293,3.7049,3.5204,3.1226,1.7236,2.0106,1.6311,0.0194,1.0447,6.0662,0.5766,5.9424,0.4774,4.711,0.0446,0.266,8.5513,1.507,1.9568,2.294,0.8897,2.3649,2.3726,2.2379,7.2376,4.0178,1.1679,3.9586,0.0428,0.179,8.634,8.5948,1.6374,7.2836,4.6663,6.896,2.2287,4.5101,8.6416,1.2025,5.4265,0.4949,0.2978,5.2122,1.1674,0.4845,0.6066,4.422,1.3363,5.7453,0.7342,5.4095,0.0015,3.8951,0.0021,3.1886,3.5712,2.3206,1.3686,2.0604,1.0715,0.8639,5.4041,3.4173,7.3363,0.2803,0.0423,1.1946,1.788,4.9726,6.7019,5.2247,2.1464,8.2013,1.0738,0.0007,0.8766,4.3195,0.1875,4.525,4.5051,1.2244,6.3341,4.9557,0.3843,5.0447,0.8789,0.7382,4.9091,0.0951,0.4649,5.9403,3.4348,4.8291,0.9,6.6836,0.0698,2.4647,1.9505,3.3097,0.2583,0.0034,1.8524,6.5539,6.1787,1.4053,4.5851,5.593,0.2278,2.7097,5.106,0.028,1.399,5.7421,0.3585,0.0061,5.3547,0.5034,1.1945,0.5252,5.7874,1.2733,4.205,0.0171,5.7374,7.4625,1.7068,5.5439,0.6285,6.4949,6.8067,2.5516,0.5473,2.0163,4.042,0.2102,3.1414]}
{"id":2816,"ended":true,"length":361,"text":"Islamic buildings are often decorated with geometric patterns which typically make use of several mathematical tessellations, formed of ceramic tiles ( girih, zellige ) that may themselves be plain or decorated with stripes, circles, rectangles, squares, triangles. Mosques can be particularly rich in such decoration, and Islamic architecture as a whole is a subject rich in such ornamentation. Several styles of Islamic art and architecture have developed over time including the architecture of Egypt and the Mughal Empire. The art styles of Islamic Spain and Turkey are also significant examples, the later one being known for its use of gold, red, and blue glazes. Islamic art is often classified into three basic eras: the Sasanian (from 538 to 663CE), the Umayyad (from 663 to 750), and the Abbasid (beginning 750 CE). The Umayyad period is known for the architecture of the Great Mosque of Damascus, the most famous of which is the Dome of the Rock. The Abbasid period was perhaps the most active of any of the Islamic eras, with the emergence of Baghdad as the centre of Islamic civilization. The architecture of these periods is noted for its elegance and subtle use of perspective and shading. Islamic architecture continues to be constructed, particularly in Egypt and the Persian Gulf; however, this is often the work of modern imams as opposed to original designers. More recently, an important trend in Islamic architecture has been Islamic revivalism.

{"id":186,"ended":true,"length":353,"text":"On returning to London, Wheeler moved into a top @ - @ floor flat near Gordon Square with his wife and child. He returned to working for the Royal Commission, examining and trying to verify the accuracy of land surveys. Although he was a leading expert on land measurement, the Royal Commission rarely sought his advice or made use of his services. He continued to live in London as well as at Newry ( 1814-1823 ), and had his home at both places on different occasions. He maintained friendships with other experts from the Royal Commission and with other scholars. He and John Keast edited and published an influential work on land measurement, Measuring and Assisting Geographers, which appeared in London in 1817. He also became good friends with Edward Bonomi, an Italian who was to become one of London's leading land surveyors. Bonomi visited Newry several times with Wheeler and a group of other land surveyors, and worked closely with him on an important project ( later completed ) in which he had to use Bonomi's surveying equipment in Ireland. In 1820 Wheeler went to Ireland with the Commissioners to examine land surveys, using data and maps supplied by Bonomi. His findings caused considerable damage to Bonomi's reputation.\n\nWheeler's position on the Royal Commission, and his standing in the land survey world generally, had been destroyed by his efforts in Newry. He was not at all popular with those who had profited from the previous land survey system of Ireland. In particular, his involvement in the Bonomi affair had given him a certain amount of notoriety at home, and he was forced to spend a great deal of money to counter the damage done to his professional reputation by Bonomi and others, and to hire experts to support his claims against Bonomi and his supporters. As a result he had little left over to continue his career in land surveying.","token_len":389,"entropy":[10.177,0.7018,5.4322,0.6688,9.1285,5.0247,3.3002,0.8901,7.4628,13.0173,10.5901,5.4497,9.0151,6.6069,4.9596,8.9337,3.1533,3.8762,1.3217,1.0674,1.4517,3.8298,0.8117,1.8038,5.2415,0.7447,8.4584,2.2062,2.1425,5.159,4.9448,3.2663,8.2049,3.4701,6.0368,0.2073,7.0534,1.2473,4.6654,0.0573,9.9541,3.5533,1.1421,6.4662,1.2292,1.4606,3.1417,6.1135,2.4651,0.6751,1.9256,7.7047,0.6858,2.9673,2.5413,0.0711,5.4602,6.1894,1.8095,1.5057,3.6569,5.9014,6.062,0.0017,0.6718,2.549,0.4108,2.0686,4.4958,0.3412,4.4308,0.7011,1.6366,3.4141,4.3185,0.6657,3.4433,6.2103,5.9074,5.1015,11.7375,5.5036,1.0922,0.4308,4.6178,1.3252,2.4104,3.7516,2.9424,3.7981,2.7929,8.297,4.7228,4.5291,7.8769,2.7566,0.4301,1.7607,5.7612,8.0293,0.2989,3.1267,4.3574,3.6983,1.6043,1.8863,0.39,1.6188,2.7431,2.7628,5.1263,1.9805,1.4963,5.4708,5.9496,6.1705,6.5596,6.6409,2.3354,1.0812,3.841,2.6413,2.3385,1.1873,0.8609,2.0736,1.9848,7.3727,0.0292,3.8278,5.3208,7.4475,6.0109,1.3576,1.7228,1.5828,3.4881,0.1608,3.9879,0.461,0.4087,4.0133,0.5515,2.0525,2.0317,4.4596,7.9304,0.0463,0.0204,4.2333,5.2539,10.2856,2.2167,0.8738,3.0157,4.9112,4.0444,1.53,4.7857,0.6252,3.3503,0.0088,4.4032,0.0151,1.3536,2.1275,1.2452,0.0365,0.5386,3.8936,0.0006,0.0007,5.1684,4.1629,0.0618,3.4821,0.0242,4.0989,0.245,1.5871,5.0154,3.043,0.0513,1.7273,2.9283,0.3291,0.0251,1.8439,1.4505,3.8551,1.4801,0.0246,1.3056,1.3826,4.8519,2.6221,1.0409,4.5038,9.597,5.1057,2.4571,2.8235,2.5155,1.0726,3.8044,1.3621,3.2865,6.7862,0.003,0.0015,0.1144,6.0883,0.0715,2.087,2.6253,8.0158,0.824,2.3582,0.495,2.9358,1.5013,4.6541,0.5317,2.8116,2.721,2.206,5.3952,1.7535,3.109,2.9391,1.3415,2.1706,6.379,5.4939,5.2081,3.2416,3.1401,0.1806,2.0645,0.0006,0.001,0.6681,3.932,3.1587,6.6772,2.3172,4.8128,0.1843,3.383,0.0002,0.0009,0.4377,0.9582,1.5412,4.0521,0.2851,1.6344,0.0008,1.9249,5.788,2.39,1.338,2.7732,0.032,3.6349,1.9999,1.2755,6.8173,1.1122,0.8574,5.5458,0.6994,3.3657,6.8408,0.2816,3.6495,1.2534,6.2906,0.6105,2.3045,6.0905,1.9436,3.5336,0.1769,0.8761,1.9598,1.3037,3.6337,4.346,0.4307,4.1497,0.7048,3.4351,0.6586,2.6923,9.2135,0.0206,0.2459,1.3504,7.9913,3.9684,0.8649,4.9469,3.2259,3.2318,0.8907,2.3194,5.7335,0.4095,3.1536,5.679,0.6478,0.8337,5.5979,0.0271,0.0204,4.3617,2.1546,5.0963,1.075,1.4423,5.1105,1.4587,0.002,2.5019,5.3884,3.2642,1.7012,1.041,1.4424,1.0508,5.2811,0.1098,6.1286,1.907,2.1583,0.0418,0.0056,2.883,1.7553,7.4103,1.4827,4.9143,1.9959,0.6602,0.5834,7.7984,0.1738,1.9977,3.7113,0.0006,0.0013,1.6938,2.5453,3.5356,2.1028,1.3051,7.415,5.5996,1.2846,5.0794,0.9242,3.2911,3.1902,2.2498,0.0004,0.0007,2.1781,1.3593,4.3554,0.2351,4.0814,0.8717,0.164,3.2103,2.4285,3.4055,6.041,3.3318,1.0664,3.7695,0.6654,2.5131,1.0728,3.7654,1.5329,0.0017,0.7866]}
{"id":218,"ended":true,"length":366,"text":"The cornerstone for a new school was laid in November 1953. A property adjoining the new school site was bought, and the house standing upon it converted to a convent for the nuns who have been on the new school site since. The first students arrived in September 1955, and the school started full-scale on 1 June of that year. It had seven classrooms, eight science rooms and library.\n\nIn 1957 the kindergarten was opened and the school offered the first level of the educational system: the basic primary level. A new school building was built on the site of the old convent, and on 4 June of that year the school moved into its present home. From the old house a library had been placed directly on the street, that had to be closed for a time because of lack of space. Now the Library is housed within the school building - there was no room for it until the building was completed. In 1960 the first teacher graduated from Lomme Gymnasium. In 1967 the secondary level was introduced in the school. In that year a large addition to the school building was also prepared. It was a multi-purpose hall that would seat 600 people or so.\n\nThe first years and decades of the school were marked by a continuous struggle for funds and equipment. A major part of Lomme Gymnasium was created in 1957 in a building under construction. When the new home was finished the new building was taken out almost at once, and turned into a library and classrooms. The library served as an information base for almost 50 years. During many of those years the building served as a place for exams.\n\nIn 1983 the school was granted a new building by the government. The old gymnasium was used by the students as a student dormitory in winter.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1994 the school was in the top of the regional list of schools, and was praised for its work in the region.","token_len":389,"entropy":[11.0546,3.4492,3.0856,3.3099,5.5514,3.2708,4.9765,1.2531,6.2114,5.5743,1.3942,3.6353,9.5962,8.9867,0.6552,4.3834,0.9758,6.6589,0.7258,3.106,4.4625,1.4935,1.2909,5.4868,9.2088,5.3339,0.9092,8.6851,1.5742,0.614,6.7074,4.0574,1.2215,5.563,3.5507,4.6757,1.6782,5.3612,0.6773,6.8535,0.3744,1.946,1.1483,2.7601,1.5128,4.5631,3.871,3.8956,0.9683,3.2787,2.0607,1.0213,0.803,1.6671,1.5939,4.0916,6.1158,0.9692,5.1185,5.0345,4.7974,3.0591,5.83,0.661,0.0146,0.1502,3.6675,3.5277,5.3807,2.7609,0.7608,3.7285,6.519,2.4509,1.6484,8.2448,1.7348,1.9456,0.0045,2.5969,3.3587,1.6578,8.0663,1.7505,1.3661,2.7556,1.1749,2.3157,6.6549,3.0742,1.8356,7.6073,0.7241,4.6645,6.5405,1.7176,4.7531,2.6945,4.6382,6.2457,3.8196,0.809,3.8104,3.4472,2.655,2.6676,0.6042,0.8796,1.7968,0.5471,0.4767,1.959,0.1892,1.0246,4.6366,1.2726,1.0382,4.0924,3.7194,2.1862,2.973,0.4434,0.0172,1.0585,1.6912,4.4246,1.4115,1.9605,3.1629,3.745,0.8429,5.7721,1.8949,4.6682,3.5904,3.5453,5.4019,4.1366,0.1361,4.2961,7.3424,1.9384,0.3437,5.5231,1.243,6.6686,3.0252,5.5545,0.1116,3.6038,2.1216,2.2374,2.7857,3.9861,0.4202,4.9982,0.0025,2.4016,0.5445,6.1677,0.9243,8.1154,2.3826,4.2494,3.1929,0.7151,2.7663,1.2428,6.3054,4.4377,2.6343,1.6126,3.2327,0.6546,3.6077,4.3592,1.6138,3.0965,0.2988,2.4035,1.1913,3.1477,3.0622,0.7027,3.2881,4.6558,5.8457,0.9832,6.8923,6.0194,4.1895,7.4315,0.3558,0.002,1.6852,2.4059,2.751,0.6717,7.9688,1.8144,0.7871,5.4914,3.5208,0.8802,2.1492,1.5754,2.2254,7.1393,0.2783,3.0755,4.2242,6.6226,2.1373,0.1326,1.407,1.8874,0.2847,3.7504,7.3855,1.2998,2.9943,0.9548,2.6244,6.1465,0.0554,0.8649,4.9247,2.4807,3.7277,5.0711,5.1401,3.5699,6.0624,2.0548,0.6375,1.1939,0.0002,1.4569,2.6981,5.948,4.7548,4.4968,0.3043,0.4933,0.522,1.0567,3.1102,0.1338,1.8494,6.1075,4.7275,1.3848,6.5523,1.8238,5.0282,0.5188,3.5945,4.5838,2.6931,0.0275,7.925,0.0538,0.0006,0.6062,0.0598,0.0005,1.1407,5.5464,1.2872,3.6888,3.8944,2.432,3.7906,4.6379,0.3475,2.6385,5.2663,0.7146,4.0166,6.2996,0.3644,2.679,2.3262,3.6303,0.4689,0.6398,4.8582,3.9982,9.0241,6.1903,0.885,1.2008,1.0761,7.5121,0.2027,0.4292,4.2828,2.8209,4.139,0.5177,1.418,2.2614,5.7923,0.4857,2.5286,5.4322,4.1148,0.5185,6.5968,4.6942,0.6058,0.9379,3.9532,6.2202,1.0875,1.2566,0.0994,1.0566,3.0269,3.8532,0.1637,0.7063,3.442,0.8799,9.057,2.6713,1.7494,0.0002,1.7276,6.6831,0.7097,1.5499,1.2653,5.9479,1.3416,1.4931,1.3843,3.0301,0.4944,3.607,1.17,1.1836,3.9645,7.0183,0.035,0.0005,0.6794,4.0443,2.7052,0.922,2.6871,2.634,0.7006,5.5612,3.2467,0.19,3.9025,7.0169,1.3659,2.9344,0.0002,4.6885,5.8565,0.8836,2.281,0.7212,0.8509,1.1409,4.2775,1.8362,5.9473,2.5451,0.6482,6.7025,3.5651,0.6563,2.3623,2.9104,1.431,1.9645,7.121,0.964,0.5592,4.3068,1.2438,1.5993,5.2132,0.5864]}
{"id":213,"ended":true,"length":355,"text":"Aside from his career in hockey, Ross was interested in improving the game. Prior to the start of the 1927 \u2013 28 season, the NHL adopted a new style of goal net net that would significantly increase scoring. The first four goals of the season were scored in the first minute of play. It was thought that a two-minute clock on each end of the ice would make plays too fast to evaluate \u2013 hence the rule change.\n\nWith the net goal measuring 8-feet by 6-feet and 6-inches from the top hole, scoring became very easy for players like Babe Pratt. Pratt, along with his brother and teammate Eddie Pratt, scored 581 goals from 1927 \u2013 30 in an astounding 597 games.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the net goal, goalies on average allowed just four goals per game. Post-net goal was slightly easier to score \u2013 just five goals per game during the first season.\n\nPratt had five shutouts in the 1927 \u2013 28 season and was in the running for the league scoring title. He came agonizingly close to winning the scoring title that year, with just seven points shy of Maurice Richard and 12 short of the second place Guy Lafleur.\n\nPratt scored four goals in a 6 \u2013 4 win over the Ottawa Senators. The next day he scored a record ten goals in a 13 \u2013 2 Canadiens win over the Detroit Red Wings at home. On the road, Pratt recorded a five goal game and finished with 14 goals for the month.\n\nIn this game, Pratt became just the second player to score five goals in one period on home ice at Montreal- Olympic Stadium ( a game against the Boston Bruins in 1931 ). The only other player to accomplish the feat was Maurice Richard, in the second period of this same game against the Bruins.\n\nHe made many friends during his hockey career, including future Hall of Famer Johnny Bower.","token_len":389,"entropy":[4.2806,3.6161,5.8415,2.2223,5.3098,0.2541,7.0285,3.1573,6.577,0.0288,6.5256,2.8401,2.1372,2.2173,7.4106,0.0037,2.2371,4.5032,0.0142,0.7495,11.0448,9.5764,2.767,0.5888,0.5937,2.9466,5.2616,5.7502,1.1153,1.7084,4.8876,0.1764,5.2826,9.3214,9.9515,5.5361,3.2437,7.1095,1.76,4.7259,1.3136,2.1036,3.2754,5.8138,1.5418,1.9221,0.4456,0.8582,1.0517,1.2071,2.1485,1.1466,2.2445,3.8202,1.2349,2.7395,1.0864,4.196,0.5791,5.9581,0.545,3.5755,5.3022,0.581,1.4469,5.8457,4.7648,4.6587,2.8403,1.2442,0.1223,0.4097,0.3887,3.5997,6.745,6.1941,3.0814,2.4672,9.0687,6.5845,4.4984,0.6497,4.4164,3.433,0.7444,1.1874,0.0011,4.2056,0.8421,7.5218,3.1308,9.6337,4.6806,2.5246,2.8795,2.4209,2.2946,0.0846,0.805,2.2114,4.523,0.1195,1.6134,6.4408,0.6312,3.0995,8.9856,0.5336,6.2848,4.7399,4.5428,2.4802,2.5806,2.4109,3.3173,9.5263,10.2156,1.8079,3.367,2.7901,4.4568,0.0017,1.5299,1.7354,2.7343,3.6934,6.1794,2.4601,0.3419,5.0365,4.8826,4.9326,0.7435,3.9357,3.3775,2.3527,4.6098,3.1914,4.952,4.7827,3.9639,5.674,0.7811,0.481,1.131,0.0003,6.1221,0.0044,1.0821,3.1593,0.011,0.5128,4.1483,0.2069,1.8631,5.5359,0.404,5.0771,3.8236,6.6886,2.9909,4.5853,0.3078,1.6633,0.3581,0.6447,7.5541,0.6034,7.0051,0.2671,4.9488,7.0372,3.7192,1.7302,1.5044,3.7056,3.036,3.6714,0.6866,0.7683,0.1101,4.7841,0.5394,2.1097,3.3666,0.7913,1.266,0.0002,6.4487,0.0126,3.2029,5.429,6.9225,0.1567,1.1342,2.3986,1.8735,1.702,0.9477,0.2194,2.2784,2.5565,4.6572,0.8686,6.281,0.4338,0.7363,2.4315,3.5169,0.4762,0.5146,1.7362,5.1313,9.4086,0.0892,0.0157,0.0188,0.1516,2.5731,0.4965,5.9215,0.1324,3.9656,0.7156,1.4103,3.5597,3.2001,4.0816,2.4586,8.1741,0.0127,11.2905,3.3766,3.1564,5.7739,6.0077,0.207,1.1877,5.6793,2.5984,10.3633,3.3702,0.0506,0.0008,0.6611,0.5255,0.0002,2.8796,0.0041,3.4678,4.1854,0.4373,0.5854,2.4489,4.6441,3.5303,2.1297,3.4206,0.45,0.782,3.6781,0.2238,1.983,2.237,2.6684,4.6432,1.9882,1.3374,2.2627,5.713,5.463,0.7111,0.7477,0.8468,6.1871,0.5463,2.394,11.8542,0.8118,0.6634,0.265,3.3238,0.0312,0.0058,4.5027,3.8285,0.3618,5.1182,1.558,3.575,0.9008,4.8316,4.3304,2.4722,5.9928,1.0242,2.0604,2.2386,3.3951,1.3199,4.06,1.5256,4.1151,0.7482,7.0829,1.0713,0.3333,0.0002,2.333,5.5101,2.6101,0.4456,2.1646,5.374,2.7038,0.1223,1.378,1.6311,1.1773,1.0086,2.1356,0.4072,0.3913,3.6882,6.009,4.4163,3.8361,0.0186,4.4293,4.3531,5.7037,13.1655,0.6591,3.4293,11.8344,3.0702,4.4681,0.4374,3.4414,0.0584,1.5717,5.0794,3.5924,2.2459,4.3218,0.24,0.6422,0.3932,2.4341,2.1283,0.0116,0.3598,4.8138,0.2503,1.6706,4.4403,3.7697,4.0794,1.3045,0.5324,3.959,5.0069,0.325,2.9515,0.2328,3.9063,0.6437,0.6273,0.0002,5.22,4.3082,5.9872,4.0184,2.7462,0.3895,3.5726,0.2143,1.3972,1.16,8.1982,1.3472,0.0579,0.8587,0.0001,5.4567,3.7581,3.3376,1.8481]}
{"id":1293,"ended":true,"length":346,"text":"Before the formation of Alice in Chains, then @ - @ drummer Layne Staley landed his first gig as a vocalist when he auditioned to sing for a local glam metal band known as The Dead Dogs, who were auditioning someone to replace original frontman Mike Pacheco, who had jumped off the roof of his apartment building.\nIt probably sounds like a pretty cool story, but it's not really any more exciting than any other rock-star origin story out there. The Dead Dogs played at a local club called The Bottom Line, and Staley's audition tape wound up on the hands of bass and drum player Jerry Duplessis, who became Alice in Chains'producer. Duplessis had Staley audition for The Dead Dogs that very night, and he and his bandmates liked what they heard.\nStaley then fronted The Dead Dogs alongside a lineup featuring Duplessis, drummer Rob Cavallo, and guitarist Jerry Cantrell, who was still playing in his first band at the time -- Alice in Slavery. After a month of playing, all three members of Alice in Slavery agreed to quit that band, with Cantrell eventually jumping ship, too. A series of shows, some with Alice in Chains as their support act, followed, and in February 1990, Alice in Chains got their start.\nThey went on to record their debut EP, Jar of Flies, in 1990, but before it could hit stores, Staley disappeared, and was later found dead of an overdose in his Seattle apartment. He was replaced almost immediately by William DuVall, who remained in Alice in Slavery for the rest of the band's life (as well as the beginning of its reincarnation, as X in 2005).\nDuVall is still with the band today.\nBelow, you can hear Staley and DuVall, two completely different bands at different stages of their early careers.","token_len":389,"entropy":[2.551,8.1728,0.0402,11.888,2.2927,5.0313,0.4078,7.0112,10.7369,9.9297,5.2325,10.9002,8.9039,1.3441,5.3897,4.1731,8.33,3.3321,0.7643,1.2861,1.8207,1.0514,3.7112,0.0206,5.3854,0.696,7.1301,0.0021,3.1552,3.8322,1.4304,2.8963,4.643,9.2015,4.2828,0.0984,6.323,0.2896,1.9894,5.3741,4.9543,2.6127,2.9895,1.9238,8.4636,0.0801,8.8218,2.9723,2.6594,8.8028,4.7803,4.3145,5.3098,6.5235,0.0039,2.6384,0.8021,1.5245,7.9699,5.0242,0.9279,4.8829,0.7876,1.5387,3.2073,0.8557,1.2638,1.1966,10.9356,7.6264,4.0292,1.0223,0.9462,3.426,4.201,4.0321,0.6384,0.3632,1.7715,0.904,1.5546,3.0491,5.3662,1.4426,4.2545,0.3373,3.6212,1.3663,5.8996,3.3157,2.6618,9.3739,0.0301,5.7899,0.0199,0.4514,2.7801,2.684,0.2231,4.1236,2.5198,2.6969,2.9751,3.2848,1.0493,1.9068,6.7205,4.9147,1.2473,1.2207,4.5164,0.0014,2.6836,4.7955,5.4563,8.2971,0.0132,1.468,0.9091,6.7783,0.0088,6.1232,7.652,3.3032,3.2238,5.4661,7.153,7.0188,0.0195,0.8837,0.3291,4.8032,4.8935,0.3141,0.0004,0.5102,15.63,0.0005,0.8781,3.7027,0.0,0.0016,3.0596,9.3442,0.0002,2.9049,2.6838,3.7566,1.5118,0.0528,6.1672,5.2043,1.4886,0.421,0.551,2.4055,4.6116,1.8383,1.046,1.2081,7.0035,2.329,0.218,1.1633,0.5002,1.2139,2.5901,0.0015,3.6344,10.7613,0.0162,1.6872,1.132,0.0551,5.791,3.2646,5.7725,4.4334,7.3802,0.0,0.0018,0.5836,3.2865,5.006,8.4418,1.868,0.2043,1.1453,2.1231,5.425,7.9262,1.3546,1.1252,0.9355,2.3516,4.8796,2.1773,2.7225,2.3065,4.6152,1.6762,3.1937,0.4769,0.0355,6.537,5.9071,0.0559,14.6833,2.6275,0.8161,3.4246,2.1763,4.8444,0.6554,3.1559,2.139,5.8698,1.6304,3.3337,1.7441,2.1843,0.0431,5.6577,0.0061,5.6331,0.2843,5.704,5.4623,1.3507,1.4434,5.2555,2.1211,0.0001,3.601,7.3281,2.5141,2.9666,4.8961,0.2459,5.0281,7.1389,0.0014,4.1486,2.965,4.0022,3.6629,5.0527,0.1213,1.1156,3.628,2.941,8.2902,4.4297,0.2921,2.7858,0.7296,1.1827,3.3049,4.4119,5.5493,0.5399,3.0849,0.0963,0.048,5.0124,2.562,4.674,2.9183,0.9147,4.8252,3.6998,0.3684,0.115,2.8938,2.8104,2.1436,3.4626,0.4486,13.2403,4.7728,7.3757,0.2392,0.2546,1.8923,3.7953,0.4065,2.4497,4.4624,3.3822,1.8051,2.2674,2.2109,0.2436,2.3789,0.0015,7.5672,2.4177,1.3584,4.9437,4.2082,1.0915,1.0017,2.5076,2.182,1.0538,1.8489,1.0264,5.5727,0.8371,0.3945,2.8138,1.0027,6.2015,8.0667,0.2733,0.3213,7.794,6.5848,10.3054,2.1749,0.4055,0.6197,5.8375,2.1968,3.7322,0.0224,2.6416,0.0058,1.2612,2.7888,1.0632,0.0007,1.0389,1.9714,0.0938,1.9614,4.8375,3.8362,0.9331,0.008,2.6758,6.0651,0.1044,5.3643,8.3074,0.0795,2.4196,3.7517,9.2505,6.4587,7.2602,0.568,0.7631,4.5413,0.0604,0.0004,4.3647,2.4574,4.1221,1.0928,0.0807,0.5727,2.4166,1.4209,7.9399,1.1445,1.9749,0.436,1.5892,1.3866,0.0014,3.1537,1.6925,0.2539,0.0004,4.2901,5.5021,6.9601,0.1663,3.5548,3.9375,4.8213,2.7973,0.3014,0.2844,6.5669,1.1107,1.1126]}
{"id":187,"ended":true,"length":369,"text":"Upon the retirement of the Keeper of the London Museum, Harmon Oates, Wheeler was invited to fill the vacancy. He had been considering a return to London for some time and eagerly accepted the offer, although he was reluctant to leave his children a long way from home.\n\nA large part of his career while a resident of London had been spent organizing, cataloguing and displaying the \"fancy dress\" of the court. It was at the time the greatest collection of its kind in the world. It was also, as he said later, \"the very hardest thing I ever did \". The task of cataloguing was enormous and it took him many years to achieve even partial completeness. One of the problems was to deal with the fact that the royal court and the court of private aristocrats both dressed to impress. In the past, courtiers would always turn up to receive visiting dignitaries dressed to the nines. On the other hand, private gentlemen and ladies were encouraged to dress and appear as they wished, and both groups were constantly adding new costumes to their collections. Wheeler also encountered the problem of differentiating between the various costumes that had been combined or adapted for practical purposes - sometimes even to disguise the wearer. In addition he was the curator of a number of rooms in the museum where special exhibits were collected, e.g. \"pantomime dames \", jester costumes and so on. He was particularly fond of illustrating these with sketches of those he met and described as amusing examples of bizarre costumes.\n\nIn this way he covered many of the main attractions of London - the Tower of London, St. Paul's, the Westminster Abbey and the Royal Palace. He also toured the country in order to present his subjects to visiting guests and to take in more sights. His travels enabled him to keep in touch with theatrical, musical, circus and sporting activities, and he found all this very absorbing and interesting.","token_len":389,"entropy":[2.2367,8.6243,0.1243,2.2107,11.4791,0.6929,0.7579,9.025,4.6504,0.7382,12.9702,9.2253,3.8922,1.7539,12.425,3.3251,5.9555,0.2022,6.1146,0.8711,1.9448,1.2881,1.8527,2.7919,1.3065,7.8464,2.2167,4.169,0.1499,3.0009,1.9641,1.7741,0.1315,1.7826,8.826,1.6539,0.8063,1.8937,1.8717,3.3577,0.8268,1.563,4.6507,0.1087,2.6277,1.7904,6.4656,6.5569,5.2945,1.5269,1.5872,0.6909,0.3456,1.8123,0.0058,3.9074,5.3653,2.4152,0.0126,1.365,4.8839,9.0325,3.8941,4.9814,0.5358,1.2119,2.0943,0.4879,1.0168,7.1457,3.3245,5.3271,0.2482,0.7395,4.9139,1.7492,6.7215,6.6265,4.532,7.2696,0.9845,0.6238,0.9997,7.554,1.7455,3.4566,0.4818,3.5701,2.0861,2.4611,3.1931,4.7966,3.9759,0.2181,6.3206,0.1037,1.0294,0.5068,0.3194,0.9265,2.5266,0.864,2.8655,3.3534,2.1168,2.4369,2.5857,4.046,0.1952,0.8713,1.0073,4.919,7.2541,1.4827,1.8475,1.0221,0.9967,7.7897,2.9004,6.9159,0.8632,1.8014,0.386,3.1891,5.4636,1.1954,2.8993,2.0112,2.1428,2.38,0.7514,0.4301,4.8507,5.7116,5.2459,5.7397,0.0598,0.4127,4.3963,0.6695,0.6129,4.304,1.4211,3.0816,5.9482,0.0715,0.9644,3.2211,0.029,1.4583,6.0588,2.1285,4.2102,1.2982,2.4149,1.2057,6.7462,8.3712,0.6898,7.1721,7.508,4.4444,2.325,2.7265,3.0292,1.9314,4.5325,1.0639,7.6433,2.7661,3.3618,4.2864,5.5119,1.0707,3.0344,6.445,9.6322,0.9212,0.0212,0.0,4.2168,2.77,4.3023,1.457,0.0803,0.9754,5.1878,1.0015,0.6386,0.0238,0.0463,8.1168,3.8973,3.9429,2.2336,2.0033,6.0797,0.136,1.7739,4.079,3.7295,2.6467,1.402,3.152,1.8961,1.7655,6.9636,5.7941,1.3903,6.2234,6.8865,2.2217,3.6153,0.8942,0.5964,1.6829,0.1889,6.8376,4.0103,5.4845,2.1643,1.9177,0.0985,7.9797,1.9222,1.2692,1.6485,4.6027,3.6018,2.3634,3.2058,0.3174,8.1753,4.2277,6.0096,1.7314,8.7594,0.669,6.494,5.0806,3.9342,3.0206,4.7007,1.5661,4.2726,1.3002,2.7164,3.0895,4.5914,2.1239,5.9634,6.0748,0.1723,2.8106,3.5719,0.0034,6.214,1.556,0.3562,3.8941,3.6456,5.0731,5.0482,0.7878,5.7213,1.8656,7.0455,0.0201,0.0287,0.7043,4.4291,6.4829,5.2714,0.6164,6.854,2.3941,6.7561,8.1271,3.16,1.9968,1.529,4.3586,0.2196,0.1837,2.3479,1.6494,3.0822,2.6023,0.0094,6.8241,4.4849,6.2034,4.3167,1.6835,5.1883,3.0261,5.3009,2.7037,5.2963,1.4345,6.4054,6.4692,0.6766,7.5994,1.8671,0.6401,1.0849,0.0003,2.2582,4.8627,1.4746,0.8822,7.011,2.7788,1.4,0.1525,4.7534,3.5799,0.7153,2.5813,3.4323,1.4777,5.2396,0.5376,0.0037,0.6521,4.8211,1.0775,2.5183,0.0635,4.4135,0.988,5.2279,0.8802,1.1219,1.3036,2.7221,2.3505,0.5865,1.2141,1.3782,6.4648,0.7358,4.6976,2.6281,2.8858,0.0149,4.7616,1.5155,5.7,2.1207,6.6798,3.722,2.07,1.1485,5.7566,3.8697,4.8236,5.5043,1.4078,3.0767,5.0134,5.8918,0.1141,0.0506,4.7686,3.9687,0.2988,0.0446,10.9004,3.9698,3.2785,1.5719,5.4124,0.4574,6.3172,4.2894,1.9541,1.5867,1.3748,4.7981,5.552,3.5257,4.045,8.6338,1.8097,2.8793,0.3097]}
{"id":2462,"ended":true,"length":309,"text":"Kechewaishke was born around the year 1759 at La Pointe on Madeline Island ( < unk > ) in the < unk > region. Now part of Wisconsin, La Pointe was a key fur-trading post on Lake Michigan. Although he was a member of the \"Indian-Carrying Party,\" he was not a resident of LaPointe, but of the adjoining island of < unk >, named Madeline for an early missionary named Marie ( < unk > ) Madeline. Later records, however, indicate that he was originally from < unk > ( and also < unk > ), along with his brother and one other individual. Kechewaishke's name is said by some to be from the French word for \"red,\" because his skin was often ashen yellow. This is probably an error, though, as there was no known Indian known by the English name \"Kechewaishke\" that was ashen yellow in color.\n\nThe earliest known Kechewaishke entry on our records begins in 1774, when the missionary Reverend Pierre Landon < unk > took custody of him and allowed him and his family < unk > and one other family to reside at the mission. Kechewaishke and his family were removed to the mission, but he was returned as part of the early evacuation of the fort after the British took Fort Chicago in July, although this appears to have been a misunderstanding as the group included one other individual known as Kechewaishke, but also included two other Kechewaishkes: one who had been taken at age five (like Kechewaishke ) from near Michilimackinac by the British, and another who was taken at age ten. Kechewaishke was also known as Kecheweese.","token_len":389,"entropy":[9.0316,10.702,3.1069,10.2889,6.3445,5.7469,3.224,5.7888,2.5263,2.0571,3.2422,4.9434,3.8123,6.2246,6.8039,0.0701,4.7077,9.1981,3.8224,1.9265,4.3037,13.5013,9.8417,5.6603,4.6824,1.9188,0.7746,1.1105,11.5694,1.9509,0.0327,0.1465,2.4904,2.4514,7.724,6.5124,0.0244,9.0926,0.7348,5.8213,0.0483,0.0005,1.7029,2.0503,5.8805,10.0551,2.4579,3.7919,0.1295,3.0101,4.0761,6.5296,1.8647,1.8692,5.4703,2.8863,1.1811,1.9829,3.6759,0.0194,0.2653,5.4621,5.8989,3.9357,5.0929,8.1118,0.3734,3.345,0.824,0.7356,1.0237,1.4335,1.2875,4.6237,0.3861,2.5649,5.4384,0.0005,2.1479,2.3267,3.3531,1.1841,5.8128,5.4402,0.5194,4.2965,0.629,0.0038,0.0498,3.5067,4.827,8.3496,0.0105,4.0309,4.8654,3.7022,6.6968,2.9995,7.4274,3.9344,3.5357,0.4105,0.0021,0.0209,1.907,7.4763,0.0611,1.0593,5.7435,6.2508,4.0573,0.9436,0.0025,1.9553,0.1547,1.1944,0.7747,5.5475,1.0235,1.5168,0.2677,0.0015,0.0166,3.0307,5.8201,4.4427,3.1394,0.473,0.0041,0.0879,3.1365,5.8199,0.1028,1.8728,2.5975,2.5824,5.1468,2.9434,5.5819,0.9086,6.6565,0.2753,0.0035,0.0016,0.0046,0.0009,1.8088,3.1181,1.8917,5.1903,3.803,1.5055,0.2555,1.6467,3.2858,1.1746,4.0925,1.9176,1.6278,1.1524,6.5344,2.6584,4.7932,3.116,4.8768,0.7596,4.8291,6.4822,2.348,4.3787,1.1914,3.9513,2.0678,2.5598,3.0242,3.1168,1.0426,3.9999,1.5918,1.11,3.4587,1.872,0.626,2.8364,4.7068,5.9126,5.2305,1.6013,4.4902,2.0281,3.3931,1.9108,0.4088,0.0971,0.0729,0.162,0.0063,1.555,4.4018,2.2042,4.4704,1.3441,2.351,2.6135,2.0773,0.6422,2.1275,0.0254,2.4222,3.7731,1.1217,5.1417,0.2215,0.0165,0.01,0.0072,0.0055,8.4594,3.5485,5.3289,3.4629,5.9745,1.7956,0.7594,4.0139,0.8229,1.2809,2.4046,5.6392,8.125,6.8106,3.9587,6.2459,7.9412,0.3672,0.0023,0.0274,5.3489,6.416,0.02,4.4746,1.9081,4.7527,0.1827,5.1183,0.5352,1.5371,8.195,0.1669,0.0028,0.0152,4.1406,5.6867,1.0713,2.7275,1.7042,3.4275,1.9794,2.014,8.3784,2.2761,3.1109,0.0726,0.0029,0.002,0.0021,0.0014,3.208,0.3125,0.9388,1.5612,6.148,0.8819,1.3481,4.1569,2.7875,1.7807,2.2355,1.747,4.438,4.0954,4.5963,0.0027,0.8386,6.2237,9.0739,1.3478,0.8863,7.3762,6.0979,1.3848,4.9742,4.2462,6.3392,7.2631,1.8134,4.0271,3.8095,9.1625,3.6067,6.0038,0.1796,0.1001,0.4231,2.0847,4.6916,4.3688,1.8789,5.58,6.2042,4.214,2.4773,2.6038,5.7288,0.3972,2.8186,0.6856,0.0288,0.0121,0.0234,0.0039,1.942,3.1562,3.8658,6.774,2.5049,1.1548,3.0845,0.2128,0.0567,0.0393,0.013,3.5171,4.2784,2.9066,3.0372,2.2215,1.1197,3.7747,4.7611,6.3253,4.6256,3.194,8.1323,1.0923,0.1616,0.0068,0.0082,0.0071,0.0053,6.1308,4.5347,8.1427,8.7995,5.6591,1.6977,5.1272,6.9108,3.2371,4.1,1.0522,1.4137,1.2902,0.3886,1.4704,0.9396,1.1883,1.2064,2.112,0.5063,2.6281,2.5021,2.151,0.1044,0.004,0.0054,0.0037,0.0112,1.267,3.6693,4.4991,0.6356,2.0703,0.5593,3.8831,7.8508,6.4555,2.7868]}

The bad news is that he could not make it all the way to the first down.\n\nHere\u2019s why Florida State transfer Blake Bortles looked decent in his first appearance at the Miami home opener in 2014. He is a guy with a very strong arm who has a knack for throwing the football to his left.\n\nThe bad news for Virginia Tech tonight is that Bortles did not throw for a touchdown. (He threw the football, though)\n\nYou know what you are getting out of Bortles tonight in terms of a strong arm. You are less clear on how effective he can be. Here is the interception to Miami defensive lineman Earl Mitchell on a pass that looked like it was intended for wideout Leonte Carroo.\n\nThe other good thing for Miami is that sophomore quarterback Brad Kaaya did not commit a turnover (0 ints, 0 fumbles)\n\nYou are probably curious about Bortles\u2019 completion percentage in the game.

{"id":1792,"ended":true,"length":354,"text":"The 1920s brought several favorable conditions that helped the land and population boom, one of which was an absence of any severe storms. The last severe hurricane, in 1906, had struck the city at the same time as the great Chicago fire. Also, the end of the world depression and recovery from the war of 1898 made people more willing to make large investments, and they flocked to the area. A lot of the newcomers were of the ethnic German American variety. The population of the city at the time was 1,719, compared to 1,539 in 1917 and 1,400 in 1910.\n\nThe number of people living within the city limits swelled from only 753 in 1911 to 1,961 in 1920. The population also expanded because farmers were drawn to the fertile lands as they saw it as a potential escape from the dust bowl years of the mid 1930s. By 1920 a third of the land in the city was farmed, and many of the farmers were German.\n\nDespite the prosperity brought by the area's increasing population, many of the German citizens still worried about unemployment. On February 5, 1919, the Mayor, John E. Schulte, issued and emergency ordinance that placed a moratorium on building permits. It also imposed a one-hundred percent tax on grain, flour, coal, and other food products. People were still willing to pay the extra tax because it allowed them to purchase at a lower cost.\n\nThe emergency ordinance was necessary because the city of Chicago had a debt of $9.2 million. This was in addition to its $6.2 million debt from World War I ( 1917-1918 ). The government was spending millions of dollars on the war and the people were expected to make sacrifices in order to maintain this spending. The only ways that most Americans had made money so far was to sell land and cattle, and to work as soldiers overseas.","token_len":389,"entropy":[10.8112,0.2831,4.8172,5.9444,9.1203,3.013,4.4384,3.6297,2.3236,7.4314,3.1193,4.9603,3.8743,2.2352,5.8965,0.2188,0.4228,0.1906,3.9207,6.9583,0.0149,4.1097,6.1772,5.474,0.7446,2.0004,5.1593,4.2063,3.0687,3.0284,2.5761,5.0234,0.0512,4.1649,4.0387,1.4606,4.2128,4.8454,1.973,2.3664,0.0978,0.7507,0.7993,4.5406,6.2233,5.4922,1.1001,6.3707,0.8282,1.3578,6.7236,0.0443,0.7059,5.0319,5.7018,2.5662,6.3703,2.0547,0.6642,3.944,4.5923,4.9381,4.1593,6.7241,2.1037,2.3065,0.0347,4.5225,5.9715,1.5511,3.2784,1.4655,3.2024,8.1412,0.0151,0.1126,1.2548,3.335,1.1261,4.4099,4.5423,0.1838,2.0107,6.2757,1.4789,4.8964,1.5389,6.1381,5.1749,6.2451,2.6552,1.2194,2.2243,4.3354,1.0111,1.2711,2.1259,4.8669,0.4668,0.2255,0.4466,4.8814,0.0869,4.7619,2.9234,0.6545,5.6287,0.7218,1.4072,0.0048,4.7536,2.2922,0.9099,4.7886,3.0746,0.6698,0.0012,5.9881,0.1757,4.1217,0.2228,1.4895,0.0075,1.6903,5.4765,0.0359,2.1676,1.7479,4.4721,1.1807,1.1725,1.4086,8.8958,0.0055,2.5791,5.1503,3.8627,5.3806,0.6216,3.3896,0.1468,1.018,0.0152,6.3379,1.8873,0.1595,2.1636,0.5429,1.5418,2.3633,4.5848,3.753,5.3603,7.5739,1.8427,6.1537,0.6326,0.3582,8.2273,3.8229,5.0324,2.6753,4.2446,2.5947,1.1187,0.8023,3.9396,6.8017,0.9686,0.7675,6.4915,6.2932,11.1475,2.3039,0.8592,7.1193,4.8899,0.0882,0.2686,3.6081,2.2982,4.7071,3.6174,0.0221,0.2505,4.685,2.1494,0.157,0.3032,0.673,7.5547,0.0898,0.944,1.0315,3.5546,1.4411,0.387,2.5546,1.5363,4.6443,2.0913,1.6397,0.0002,5.0707,0.782,6.5493,4.3631,0.2606,0.5341,5.121,1.0477,6.0007,1.1633,0.1429,3.0695,1.5662,0.1998,4.264,4.4231,3.5375,5.7921,0.3017,5.602,0.9041,4.9362,4.5226,3.3834,0.1769,2.5946,0.1289,1.4327,5.0818,4.0923,4.0005,3.9825,0.2592,4.9587,3.9554,0.3633,0.1722,3.3926,8.1429,11.9026,3.4136,2.9531,4.5409,1.3386,2.2533,0.0319,4.7575,4.6776,2.7383,4.013,2.1254,4.0078,0.7638,4.2422,0.1764,7.1993,0.0004,2.7794,1.5173,0.1062,6.0303,2.1666,6.2745,0.3232,6.8738,0.4156,1.0601,1.7595,3.8103,1.41,1.0787,5.9655,1.9426,3.7358,4.693,0.0256,2.2762,2.0516,4.9844,1.7444,3.1956,2.4482,3.8084,0.5535,0.1625,2.9774,6.0403,1.6425,1.6753,1.2813,0.6929,1.0692,0.0002,1.5167,6.5037,0.2811,1.5323,7.0363,0.8839,1.5287,1.8101,3.4578,1.3039,1.0478,2.7854,6.2426,0.5268,0.9867,4.2153,1.6778,2.5523,0.9232,1.2333,3.5687,1.1885,3.9775,0.5265,0.008,3.8203,2.2053,3.0673,0.2078,2.1782,0.0289,1.785,2.9129,3.3916,0.0035,0.3466,4.655,11.7988,2.0965,0.6634,0.2311,0.8776,1.3759,4.5891,2.4648,6.2228,4.0723,1.067,0.0265,1.7088,1.9499,2.5457,2.7306,2.0492,5.8301,1.3212,6.4872,0.0224,3.3071,3.0386,2.4415,1.0377,0.0403,3.787,4.033,6.923,0.3701,1.7305,4.9091,7.127,2.5202,6.7598,4.5555,3.8306,3.9801,2.6487,6.7973,0.0268,1.9189,1.8088,4.1966,4.0367,1.6213,5.9698,1.7835,1.5549,2.0903,4.0064,2.5498,6.0054,6.7382,0.436]}
{"id":695,"ended":true,"length":372,"text":"Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7 @. @ 8 out of 10, indicating that it was `` good ``, but his review was mixed. Comparing it with the premiere, which he called `` incredible,`` Goldman criticized the plot for being `` kind of all over the place `` and, while praising `` the action \u00bb of the episode, he said that `` as fun as it was \u00bb to watch, \u00bb he did think it had lost something. The reviewer also gave the show a note of caution, saying that, while the show has been very good in its opening hour, he would watch it with an open mind as to what the following weeks will bring.\n\nIGN had said before the premiere of \u00bb Castle that it had the potential to become one of the best shows on TV, not only for its writing but for its action, and its ratings showed that it has lived up to this potential. And the reviews certainly show that the cast is up to the task, with Esposito and Kocan both standing out. The action in the show has also been praised, with the reviewer saying that he was especially drawn to the episode because it had some of the best shooting sequences and set-pieces he has seen on TV the past year. One person who has made his opinion on the show very clear is Bruce Campbell, who is appearing more and more on television lately, including as a guest star on \u00bb Castle, \u00bb 24, \u00bb Monk, \u00bb Hawaii Five-O, \u00bb and \u00bb Castle \u2019 s sister show, \u00bb Burn Notice. He also guest starred on \u00bb Angel, \u00bb CSI, \u00bb and \u00bb Lost. When asked in an interview last year by Starpulse.com if he had a favorite \u00bb Lost \u00bb character, Campbell, whose character on \u00bb Ghost \u00bb was written out of the show at the end of season 1, named Kate Austen, played by Erin Cahill as his favorite.","token_len":390,"entropy":[10.2614,4.2273,10.9015,5.0521,2.5803,5.0081,0.6117,3.4402,13.1888,6.1787,7.1015,10.5273,7.3072,0.0055,0.0402,2.4571,7.755,0.9662,1.8716,1.2857,12.4687,10.651,6.7719,3.4142,1.9181,5.3723,3.1559,1.6552,4.7105,0.474,10.0854,0.4192,1.3134,2.5351,1.2747,6.0011,1.7608,2.353,4.0137,2.861,0.337,7.5438,1.8203,3.1869,3.7101,6.0368,0.656,6.3236,3.6432,1.9335,2.991,6.3433,0.1558,7.2218,0.6402,0.0703,0.0303,4.9869,0.92,5.0364,4.4436,4.0989,5.2825,2.7561,4.6429,16.0093,4.5535,0.8461,2.0652,0.3434,0.9022,1.3992,1.5011,4.2321,6.2362,6.0403,0.3549,0.6352,1.0491,10.552,4.0824,0.5104,0.4966,11.7714,3.6412,3.3364,3.724,1.3318,3.0073,5.6724,5.3576,2.079,3.1883,5.7296,2.8508,3.1281,0.9625,3.2781,0.4977,8.8258,1.2291,3.691,1.1624,0.6202,0.5718,2.9235,2.6331,1.4014,2.1457,3.0422,2.5885,3.657,1.6242,2.4767,1.414,3.9764,5.0539,0.265,4.8801,2.775,5.7529,0.6138,3.8543,3.1704,1.8385,0.0357,4.0969,2.2474,1.5967,2.3686,6.9534,5.977,1.5927,0.6301,0.5839,2.3575,0.3439,5.9879,4.5184,6.124,3.4768,1.6959,1.1858,3.7828,10.0544,8.0116,5.0387,1.0406,2.2865,5.0359,3.7281,0.2335,3.1812,2.7709,0.0186,0.2654,1.4017,1.5621,1.7025,1.2535,1.0708,5.6778,1.2299,1.9957,0.7465,5.5164,2.376,1.1561,0.4207,5.2454,1.7001,1.3642,3.9801,6.7822,5.1853,0.5111,2.3835,4.3073,6.5595,0.0487,0.0399,3.8425,3.3437,0.3631,3.9202,2.9946,3.3492,5.2694,3.4226,0.5423,2.7617,4.8591,1.6815,5.1545,0.4455,0.9672,0.9574,1.5362,2.2962,10.7168,2.5549,0.0001,1.8007,5.2995,6.2059,5.0585,5.0256,5.7632,0.5995,1.9741,2.6725,6.117,3.4949,1.1637,2.7537,2.3146,3.8398,0.7058,4.4216,1.2883,1.2434,2.384,3.8208,1.4335,0.4242,4.3489,2.452,5.0707,6.6535,0.0943,0.4827,4.7727,2.4808,1.3389,3.0441,3.759,1.0342,0.1516,1.4448,6.5832,3.175,2.543,6.4726,2.6399,0.4417,3.807,0.8763,0.3667,2.3265,0.8463,7.3633,1.2689,3.2936,0.497,5.2528,5.1228,0.9043,1.9689,5.2932,2.5537,4.0109,3.8,0.5359,0.49,4.8144,0.1263,0.6057,6.9617,1.8462,0.4829,0.5751,3.1923,7.2003,7.2332,2.8401,0.0004,2.3337,3.6304,5.3949,1.3136,3.0466,3.47,1.1453,1.2103,2.418,0.4784,4.1999,1.8128,1.6466,5.112,10.1839,2.0974,1.5282,10.6293,1.7546,1.1238,8.7609,0.9944,0.0012,3.8115,0.4499,0.9398,4.7728,1.4233,4.3924,10.9473,7.1874,10.0909,7.8606,0.5862,0.6853,1.0411,9.1648,2.3839,0.4646,2.9404,1.4639,8.7495,1.0247,0.7618,2.1354,8.7476,1.8196,1.5137,6.2605,0.6635,0.6012,4.2965,1.2776,4.9518,0.7691,5.4907,1.4334,5.2081,1.1943,0.1712,4.4471,1.2757,3.4515,7.5403,10.1042,4.2879,3.4096,0.0637,1.2537,0.2858,2.6499,2.6817,1.0755,5.2466,9.1424,7.7601,3.4138,0.4172,0.5683,4.8889,4.8349,2.0744,4.3778,1.7847,3.9702,6.8581,1.6442,6.3904,5.0193,0.4858,0.3402,0.6369,4.8795,0.593,1.1841,0.2766,2.8359,1.8501,0.2297,9.5683,8.3125,10.1309,0.2398,1.141,6.5315,0.2377,6.9281,9.1693,0.2405,4.9196,3.6726,3.8318,2.433]}
{"id":2864,"ended":true,"length":363,"text":"If n is a natural number and A is an arbitrary set, the expression An is often used to denote the set of ordered n @ - @ tuples of elements of A.\n\nThe relation An is denoted as An = { a }, where a is the element at position n @ - @ of A.\n\nIt may seem strange to denote the relation A as a \"set\" when A = { x, y }. However, the set An may be easily represented by a \"stack\", where A is the top layer and x, y are the n-th element on and below it. Thus, it is possible to imagine that we stack the elements of A so that if x, y are above A, then below it will be y.\n\nThe most famous definition of An is by Paul Erd\u0151s, who used it to provide a convenient notation for set operations. Specifically, he showed that the relation An is a member of the field P, the set of ordered pairs of numbers, and that if there exists an element x @ n-1 such that there is no natural number x with a natural number n @ n-1 and x < n, then there must be some element f (x) @ n-1 such that f x (f x). Thus, the relation An is a \"finite\" or countable set.\n\nMore recently, Andrew Appel used the term set to denote a set of ordered pairs of numbers when such pairs are known a priori. For example, the natural numbers are a set of ordered pairs of numbers which are known a priori.\n\nThis page presents an informal notation for the ordered pairs used in this definition. In the remainder of the page, each element of A will be defined as the value at position (x @ n-1), while y will be defined as the value at position (y @ n-1).","token_len":390,"entropy":[8.907,2.6132,1.9517,7.2763,0.6042,2.4768,5.2899,0.5949,2.822,3.3993,4.8684,1.5371,2.4815,4.8996,7.9781,2.5709,7.141,1.3396,0.6977,2.0994,1.7099,3.4247,0.6136,6.603,3.2407,10.2387,6.904,6.2213,8.7102,0.0028,3.1013,4.2464,1.8766,1.4191,1.285,1.6526,0.0022,2.3977,6.8558,4.4966,1.3211,6.3951,0.0121,2.2626,3.1749,2.9185,4.9255,5.7148,5.9468,1.4973,2.3796,0.5449,0.9291,2.6615,3.8945,2.5539,1.738,1.8505,0.4824,0.5898,6.0938,0.6979,1.0298,0.6076,0.0002,4.3967,3.4881,3.1538,1.8621,1.0749,6.506,1.9469,3.9625,1.4665,0.9934,2.8029,5.1356,4.669,1.0773,3.1935,2.449,4.3341,0.9562,4.444,2.8727,0.2804,1.3042,4.7921,1.5127,0.1633,2.0211,4.6283,5.1875,4.2442,0.7467,6.5557,2.9503,1.3618,1.9665,3.7238,7.5597,1.854,1.6043,1.192,1.2376,0.9038,6.6391,6.5566,3.5594,2.2518,3.0477,0.105,0.943,0.5867,6.1459,1.8506,0.759,1.6331,5.1737,7.4409,5.5053,2.5169,0.1899,4.3092,0.4359,2.9367,0.7466,1.6348,0.1143,5.3819,1.4773,3.7176,9.9275,2.0825,1.3145,0.7579,0.3597,5.3472,0.1786,4.2552,2.4765,2.2713,0.088,1.3284,6.1648,1.584,0.6625,0.4157,9.1918,2.7384,4.0308,0.2397,4.5809,0.6977,1.0939,0.0002,1.9394,5.4189,3.7239,4.8771,0.1734,2.6818,0.4975,5.572,5.7097,4.4752,0.6211,0.2769,0.0273,1.3757,1.0044,3.5056,1.2554,0.7753,6.6546,0.9681,3.3902,4.2946,0.1999,5.2978,3.8308,0.8426,7.0788,0.105,1.9539,4.0932,0.3794,1.8881,4.1123,1.9416,0.8804,2.139,6.9122,0.3955,1.3908,7.6164,6.0768,2.6342,4.3854,1.6614,0.9623,1.9349,4.3388,0.5693,4.5153,1.711,1.7067,1.4609,2.8373,3.8461,4.0729,1.9094,0.8977,3.7987,3.1047,3.9334,3.4839,1.3208,5.59,0.1101,3.3604,0.9568,2.8298,6.2566,0.4356,3.1213,5.3278,2.0886,1.9231,0.4773,1.4647,1.0467,0.4204,0.4098,0.2186,3.4943,3.4197,5.6949,0.4453,2.4189,0.203,1.6758,3.6552,0.2739,3.8787,0.6179,5.7899,3.8444,1.911,1.9958,2.5622,0.1609,0.0752,0.1238,1.1278,0.0032,1.4031,3.5223,4.3368,1.8963,0.8639,4.923,3.3396,0.3386,1.7109,1.9609,0.6605,0.4033,0.821,2.5624,6.3681,0.2748,1.0304,3.8234,9.0949,0.0429,2.1933,1.1251,0.4246,0.0002,5.7459,2.5344,0.122,7.9919,7.5911,0.2619,6.8348,1.2588,1.9514,2.9005,0.5604,1.1972,1.3138,1.0208,0.5934,1.9441,2.1299,0.2773,0.8679,5.8153,6.0188,1.7512,1.02,4.2377,8.167,1.2145,0.0001,0.5764,2.8346,0.5328,0.0578,2.365,6.1345,2.1285,3.92,3.9031,1.7859,0.3854,2.0702,0.6557,0.3362,1.2517,3.7305,1.1306,2.3933,1.7001,0.1029,0.0003,0.8115,1.6207,0.0001,4.0495,8.0185,4.8165,2.1244,4.4087,2.8895,0.4623,1.3965,7.7878,2.814,7.3177,0.8849,3.5162,3.0031,0.5132,3.2482,2.2201,4.7505,0.132,1.1305,2.6115,0.5076,6.3273,1.471,0.8602,1.386,2.8632,0.3688,3.1183,0.7939,2.333,5.1697,4.5167,0.3608,4.8663,1.9288,2.8017,0.2457,0.2032,0.0381,2.0016,4.253,6.1693,1.9186,0.1203,1.084,0.0251,0.3379,1.1726,0.1302,0.1123,0.4969,0.3602,0.0692,0.0525,0.041,0.1399,0.2959]}

{"id":1147,"ended":true,"length":379,"text":"The first sequel to Species, Species II was released theatrically in April 1998. The film depicts astronauts on a mission to Mars being attacked by the aliens from Species, and the events leading up to the attack are shown from the female astronaut's point of view. The plot, as well as the characters, are much the same as the first film, including the main alien Species as well as the male human scientist involved in the project (David Strathairn). The story takes place during the mission to Mars and the astronauts are attacked in the base. During the attack the female astronaut is pregnant, and the protagonist and his mate are unable to defend themselves and only have a small chance of survival. Later, when all of the team is rescued, the astronaut finds and rescues his mate who is now giving birth to a female alien. The female has become pregnant with her own mate, which she tries to kill during childbirth. After that, we also get to see the female Aliens giving birth ( and possibly mating ) in the end of the film. The last few minutes show us the male Aliens mating with the female Aliens. The two Aliens are seen having sex, or possibly having sex with female Humans. Then, the female Alien bursts and the Alien inside dies, as well as the Alien that was within her. The Male Alien is then seen walking as well as playing with his Alien son, which is shown in the previous scene. At the end of the film, we see the female and male Aliens walking together side by side and it is implied that they are also having sex.\n\nIt is unknown which species was the primary antagonist of both Species, both appear in a scene where the female Alien from Species II tries to kill the protagonist by biting the cord of the baby.\n\nThis movie was critically acclaimed, with some of its flaws being the fact that it takes to long to end, and is somewhat disney-esque.","token_len":391,"entropy":[5.3423,9.6065,1.001,12.4561,2.4065,5.556,2.1148,3.3364,1.2519,7.381,0.0136,0.0001,0.7852,4.9001,4.1309,1.006,1.6224,1.8781,5.8914,8.4005,2.2733,0.9073,1.6646,0.2308,1.1571,7.3804,3.7262,0.0793,2.7242,3.0465,4.2768,4.0443,2.9199,2.0077,1.7695,5.7221,2.1972,0.0808,0.0223,0.9586,2.3616,1.584,3.4722,4.1649,1.0505,10.4428,3.0494,0.1578,1.834,0.0187,0.0003,0.2707,1.5489,4.2936,4.4126,2.5639,1.86,0.0056,0.7002,3.4467,1.166,1.5543,5.9486,2.6187,0.0036,1.2462,1.1696,1.0363,1.1154,1.1162,4.6114,1.2444,3.6884,5.9133,9.787,4.0501,0.9998,0.0415,1.0849,5.0654,4.9499,5.2494,8.3565,1.125,0.1995,4.9481,3.6672,5.1308,6.2442,0.8061,0.0209,0.0018,0.4092,1.6759,3.4091,3.0033,0.0378,2.9789,0.5533,4.6408,1.8545,0.5176,1.9584,1.8555,4.6565,1.0627,3.755,4.2618,1.3608,5.9175,2.8324,4.5907,0.3343,1.6342,2.4324,2.6466,0.2226,1.8942,7.398,1.7705,1.109,1.4139,6.7487,4.3787,2.361,5.7647,1.3698,5.1767,0.0058,5.2092,0.3835,2.6683,5.7169,2.6542,2.5853,2.9265,3.4529,0.6235,0.2345,0.4234,4.9726,1.5456,2.7967,5.9626,1.5105,0.1966,5.7813,1.4543,3.2692,1.0311,0.8074,4.7612,5.0323,5.4065,3.4726,0.0004,1.6613,2.374,3.5304,0.9454,3.0667,7.5573,0.0135,0.3865,0.9665,5.0738,3.7687,1.5281,1.3606,3.3234,6.38,3.5781,1.3066,2.6648,1.7883,2.0519,6.7047,1.0901,3.3216,2.6255,4.7357,0.0746,2.7768,6.0817,5.0935,0.8236,2.8334,3.8539,0.7302,5.9187,4.8833,1.8735,1.25,0.3412,0.788,3.0365,6.684,7.0544,0.0198,5.6979,8.2931,5.6028,5.301,0.9848,3.0619,0.7603,6.3109,1.5904,0.3395,0.4225,0.5016,1.6868,5.4747,3.9721,1.9923,4.2777,3.0705,1.1236,3.6749,1.9338,3.5783,1.2282,0.7417,0.35,1.1741,1.7518,1.5151,4.7107,1.8466,1.6013,3.4196,3.3964,0.427,1.7529,5.9239,4.7118,1.6568,0.4852,1.9872,6.9233,5.096,1.0475,5.1451,1.2193,1.4971,2.2716,0.9533,7.3259,5.852,3.4162,2.4954,7.4901,6.8505,1.9689,3.654,2.0561,0.075,0.8952,1.6695,4.1128,1.5905,5.8704,4.0476,3.1419,1.3917,6.3507,0.5447,1.5923,2.9025,1.4607,4.9786,6.8262,2.3494,1.1765,6.2173,1.3362,1.4822,3.491,6.0293,1.7206,2.5239,1.0736,3.0433,1.343,0.4963,6.8024,3.2878,0.4292,5.0393,0.6104,0.249,0.1983,0.1359,0.4984,0.411,1.9412,0.6573,0.6919,2.3677,5.829,0.4134,0.7556,5.2959,1.2783,7.4288,0.082,0.0004,2.8085,4.6192,0.8543,3.7588,0.1909,1.3234,1.1746,4.3345,2.3388,0.1422,0.6331,1.9627,0.1975,4.6924,0.728,3.1455,3.6241,3.3806,2.7702,1.8981,3.7376,1.5481,1.3677,5.2666,1.5344,1.7363,6.4738,9.3306,1.0812,3.7662,2.8362,1.7624,0.9642,2.2866,0.8933,5.824,0.1275,2.0515,4.4647,0.0409,0.7439,0.6526,5.5758,3.2015,3.405,2.5133,10.8636,1.7455,1.2809,5.6373,2.3436,2.1081,0.0003,4.4266,2.5837,1.5203,7.1925,1.1447,1.808,2.7015,4.9003,1.9387,1.9154,6.8483,1.5778,1.8085,2.9721,0.1165,0.9687,4.5544,8.5568,3.5695,0.4302,6.3797,1.1538,1.506,3.6789,4.6136,6.0716,7.7962,2.0811,2.2518,0.8415]}

{"id":4338,"ended":true,"length":314,"text":"Bryennios arranged his army in the typical three divisions, each in two lines, as prescribed by the Byzantine military manuals. The right wing, under his brother John, was 5 @ 10,500 infantry, 30 cavalry, and four cannon. The middle wing, under the emperor, included 2 @ 5,900 infantry, 300 cavalry, and three-quarters of the imperial artillery ; and the left wing, under the archon, included 12 @ 1,500 infantry, 120 cavalry, and 1,250 archers. The emperor, in addition, had a special retinue, including a master and five assistants and four hundred and fifty men-at-arms. The camp also contained 150 light troops (i.e. the dromos mazamas and men-at-arms). The emperor was accompanied by his own personal bodyguard - six hundred light troops :\n\na heavy squadron of a hundred cavalry, 30 archers, and thirty-five light cavalry, all led by eunuch John of Kastelas ;\n\na battalion of seven hundred light troops ; and\n\na detachment of five hundred light troops commanded by Eurystheus of Byzantium.\n\n(W. G. Browne\u2019s, History of the Latin Empire; Volumes 1 & 2, p. 909 )\n\nAs Bryennios had been victorious against the Byzantines before at Dorylaeum, he sent a personal envoy to the emperor Constantine VII to claim a \u201cpeace\u201d, asking for an equalized trade treaty. He was given the reply that the Byzantines needed money, and they had raised the gold and silver tribute from their own cities in order to meet their expenses. Bryennios, apparently, believed this to be a threat of war, and immediately raised the white ensign with the red cross on the right, signifying a declaration of war.","token_len":392,"entropy":[7.7381,10.2581,9.1745,11.4947,3.4796,7.1474,2.524,1.81,10.212,7.0309,5.1243,1.87,3.2479,4.2296,3.8089,3.9196,1.5878,4.3114,8.9635,0.5311,0.7755,7.0259,4.6295,4.044,0.6317,1.616,5.6802,2.5002,2.3144,4.0295,3.4998,7.2092,6.5959,0.427,1.4657,8.8703,14.0575,3.2452,2.3945,5.5644,4.3048,1.1596,5.3654,1.4709,0.4846,1.2755,5.0451,6.3893,1.0559,0.6415,4.6096,1.2516,0.8437,0.2273,2.4429,3.7248,2.3927,8.0332,3.9725,3.2574,2.5195,0.0569,4.8797,0.5296,0.164,4.9916,0.0568,0.0804,0.4372,2.9232,7.2686,0.529,0.2921,1.9302,6.8648,3.9379,8.3443,1.9597,0.5121,0.7889,0.0866,0.5991,0.1916,0.4766,6.5508,4.3378,0.4621,0.6576,4.149,0.7362,2.9258,0.0249,1.9029,0.1829,0.1015,3.7593,0.0642,0.0478,0.2409,4.7364,1.5469,4.1473,5.2726,0.1176,0.2761,1.0868,3.7252,2.6699,2.8157,2.6932,1.2674,1.4055,2.2936,5.2189,8.3577,0.1024,0.0004,2.3794,4.8601,2.6695,7.0514,3.237,4.4004,3.3352,4.1011,3.4,6.772,4.0512,1.1831,1.9592,5.7041,0.3839,0.0041,0.0004,0.4286,1.214,8.261,4.863,1.9432,6.4971,7.7951,3.8678,3.9581,4.8197,0.2589,0.0944,1.8884,3.1306,7.8165,6.6885,5.048,8.0018,4.6029,11.0562,2.7842,5.1596,1.1928,0.1416,0.004,0.0068,1.9947,1.1588,2.9072,2.4688,3.9776,0.1527,1.7944,3.5658,3.5157,4.2427,0.4092,6.1181,6.9978,4.0366,6.2379,1.5732,7.2248,6.6497,0.0038,5.672,7.1878,5.4249,0.6375,5.0803,1.7802,2.7413,1.1768,5.2157,2.8067,0.046,0.2748,0.7429,5.2145,2.7232,1.4116,3.43,1.4295,2.1039,3.4172,5.1037,0.0302,7.6798,1.7016,1.8226,4.2984,2.989,5.4765,4.8701,3.4373,3.7907,3.2156,0.8931,0.0003,1.0899,4.6736,0.0877,4.947,1.7312,1.7567,1.2181,2.7682,1.2521,0.7961,0.0004,0.7905,2.425,0.0803,3.2886,0.2821,1.2691,0.1688,5.5905,0.0232,3.2464,4.4754,2.8509,2.3498,1.328,1.062,5.1408,0.014,0.0115,0.5108,0.9503,0.0004,5.5731,6.8175,1.5635,4.0236,0.3879,7.2589,11.4265,8.7826,6.2067,3.4581,2.8109,0.0966,0.6133,7.5278,2.8833,5.7917,4.7299,4.7483,2.1794,2.4561,0.1084,0.5303,1.7074,0.0524,4.5185,4.8783,4.475,0.4186,0.0004,4.594,11.1369,0.0169,0.0327,2.5906,2.6592,6.4905,3.6976,0.601,4.6015,0.0164,0.0348,5.4436,6.3584,5.9323,6.4544,2.7217,3.5698,0.3574,0.6028,1.4803,4.8981,2.0592,5.448,4.1717,0.3877,1.2784,1.5615,7.341,5.3534,1.9108,6.7005,3.4198,14.6437,6.5525,8.8369,5.5008,6.2898,3.0793,6.9147,1.5017,3.4809,5.1451,6.6449,6.2242,5.0337,1.9433,2.7141,1.9429,4.3188,1.3495,6.7091,0.9081,1.6034,2.8655,0.045,0.0225,5.0436,4.8953,1.7184,0.9749,4.1317,2.6743,6.5496,1.267,5.5125,2.8354,0.4471,8.5249,2.5197,2.5972,2.1734,6.488,3.1775,1.3188,0.0573,3.9073,1.6806,3.6672,0.3473,2.8399,0.018,0.0086,2.3752,6.8594,3.2186,4.2897,3.0266,1.3477,0.0437,1.3781,6.2339,4.237,1.885,0.8588,0.8273,5.4171,5.2698,0.54,8.4437,8.082,0.0057,3.3374,1.3652,4.0853,3.632,2.2389,1.5952,3.0484,2.2375,5.6816,0.0221,2.3884,4.5612,0.1719,0.2499,0.5888]}
{"id":3888,"ended":true,"length":261,"text":"Before the recognition of more than one species, differences in population density were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near Ambanja. Later, it was recognized that Coquerel's giant squirrel ( Pteromys coquereli ) was a separate species. The first recorded species of squirrel in the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea was probably the Rufous-bellied squirrel ( Sciurus maurus ). At the same time, the Red-bellied squirrel (Sciurus hongkongensis) was recorded from Bougainville and the Moresby Islands and the Eastern Highlands forest and the Yellow-bellied Squirrel ( Sciurus fuliginosus) from the highlands of Madang. These species were recorded in addition to the Coquerel's squirrel as early as 1905 to 1920. In the first half of the 20th century, a variety of species of squirrel were recognized from Papua New Guinea : the Bail-tailed squirrel (Sciurus balthazar ), the Long-tailed squirrel (Sciurus oculeus), the Green-headed squirrel ( Sciurus viridis ), the Tawny-naped scrotum-eared squirrel (Sciurus fuscicollis ) and the Red-tailed scrotum-eared squirrel (Sciurus leschenaultii). At least four more species were recognized in the 1960s : the White-bellied scrotum-eared squirrel (Sciurus bicolorus), the Brown-headed scrotum-eared squirrel (Sciurus melanotis), the Ashy scrotum-eared squirrel (Sciurus fuscatus) and the Black-tailed scrotum-eared squirrel (Sciurus nigricollis ).\n\nSince the late 20th century, some of these species have been considered as subspecies of the nominate species (Sciurus coquereli ).","token_len":393,"entropy":[2.551,10.198,0.4621,7.6555,0.4773,3.6921,5.7437,1.2942,8.971,0.4572,5.2276,3.4218,3.0219,3.814,1.9977,6.1602,6.311,8.3536,7.3978,6.2827,5.9204,0.8964,4.0709,0.5846,6.7505,6.7998,5.9584,5.4533,0.8773,7.6561,1.0098,3.8956,0.3007,4.7666,0.1361,10.3965,5.2248,5.5137,0.6173,3.157,6.9534,6.4998,3.0207,9.135,3.341,4.2425,2.2181,6.5002,2.6551,0.1178,5.0792,0.4675,1.6216,2.3338,4.7283,0.3299,1.963,2.3217,4.0491,3.6181,3.2527,1.3704,3.8826,2.1269,1.5545,4.2583,5.0719,1.4868,4.3717,0.2607,0.0015,1.007,5.2113,1.6247,5.8366,2.7486,2.2644,4.5445,6.9152,0.5574,2.7753,0.6086,9.8533,2.8474,5.2469,7.4325,1.905,5.3362,1.2794,1.3947,0.0119,0.2043,1.7926,7.523,2.719,3.214,0.0024,0.859,0.722,4.2529,2.5299,0.0015,5.4493,6.4957,5.2874,4.1742,1.3464,0.9829,0.7474,4.9798,1.9589,9.4949,1.3738,0.0028,2.5314,2.6548,5.5261,7.3149,0.6892,2.1451,3.2272,2.3469,6.4064,1.1954,9.9309,4.4052,2.2364,6.459,1.5356,0.1737,0.0014,3.5908,0.5998,4.7514,0.0026,5.9775,4.651,1.4714,1.1491,3.9516,0.7219,1.5635,7.1326,0.163,0.5334,6.3582,4.7965,1.9788,3.0932,2.3356,1.4048,4.6182,1.7115,7.0406,0.0101,0.822,5.1507,0.0485,0.0504,0.071,1.4828,1.9873,4.8537,3.3778,0.0141,5.7513,6.5182,4.1443,0.6064,2.6653,1.537,4.6423,3.2841,0.0102,0.149,0.8031,0.0369,0.0694,0.3036,3.4464,4.6863,0.008,1.5309,1.1298,1.4594,1.6162,3.1078,2.8177,3.9197,0.0132,0.0195,9.0584,1.4292,5.4304,6.5728,3.675,4.0627,1.5869,0.2273,4.2121,1.3862,0.0019,3.7783,7.312,5.922,4.2686,0.3991,5.6129,0.2946,1.1925,0.4875,0.0224,1.1164,0.0314,0.0004,5.2645,9.7902,2.5443,2.1131,0.3631,4.9589,0.121,4.467,0.1557,0.0227,4.6745,0.0008,6.9122,1.0533,0.1754,0.5416,5.5718,2.4554,0.0202,0.3833,6.6065,7.154,7.3738,4.0342,0.4662,4.7342,3.2437,0.246,0.0291,1.6767,0.0167,0.0006,4.7983,3.5278,4.1667,5.292,0.9933,2.3131,0.1049,0.1539,3.4669,0.0294,3.8465,5.4014,0.1535,0.059,0.3138,0.0296,0.1683,0.0481,1.5616,0.0099,0.0006,4.2271,8.2033,3.39,10.9557,2.5866,1.2399,5.1055,2.9628,3.1873,3.6071,0.3614,1.1457,1.2578,1.6378,0.9192,4.9142,0.0628,4.5079,0.3362,5.1157,0.0856,1.5883,0.0042,4.898,0.0095,0.0584,0.1708,0.0289,0.1973,0.0877,1.2624,0.032,0.0004,3.8034,7.7346,5.9269,2.2817,0.133,3.5118,0.0506,3.985,1.7898,0.0005,0.0071,0.0311,0.0029,0.2567,0.009,0.21,0.0058,0.0004,7.2828,3.549,2.7408,0.7717,0.1784,6.8068,6.0863,8.9247,0.0046,0.0078,0.0166,0.0042,0.1775,0.0093,0.0784,0.005,0.0006,4.191,0.3783,9.1482,1.9464,0.035,0.0611,2.9547,0.0381,2.0336,0.6902,0.0009,0.0068,0.008,0.0012,0.0705,0.0077,0.0673,0.0042,0.0007,5.4793,2.3244,5.669,0.0349,2.6549,2.5238,0.0129,5.1069,0.8829,2.8848,2.7027,0.0067,0.0336,0.1571,4.2359,2.13,3.1428,0.8639,0.5295,0.4663,4.6921,2.3225,5.039,0.1813,0.5694,0.8861,16.7558,1.0491,2.4729,3.6698,0.5561,0.0027,4.2343,0.4294,0.0166,1.2528,2.5065]}

Thus the Jains have successfully survived as a distinct people group in India, by abandoning that which was against their traditions and beliefs, which would have been more detrimental to their future than useful. It is also noteworthy that the Jain community survived these various adversities intact only because of the support and loyalty of the Pashtun aristocracy. Thus, in spite of the Pashtun onslaught, Jainism is a formidable force in India today.\n\nIn addition to this, it must be mentioned that the Jain Sanghs were so active that they could not only protect the Jains who were against \u2018 < unk > sakala \u2019, they could also promote it.

{"id":2187,"ended":true,"length":349,"text":"Common starlings may be kept as pets or as laboratory animals. Austrian ethologist Konrad Lorenz wrote of them in his book King Solomon's Ring as `` the poor man's dog `` and considered them pests on fruit orchards. They have been a major problem around London, where the mayor of Kensington, Nick Paget-Brown, issued a warning to residents in January 2013 that ``if your street gets too quiet, be aware of the likelihood of starlings nesting in nearby trees. ``\n\nBut common starlings, which are fairly easy to spot, don t have nearly the same reputational problems as some of their more invasive cousins. Despite their reputation as a problem, they are easy to confine. The Department of Agriculture issued an announcement in March 2013 urging residents in Illinois who find large groups to contact pest control operators or Department of Agriculture officials.\n\n``They won t hurt you, they won t make a nest in your house,`` said Mark Brongersma, who owns and operates Starlings Removal in St. Clair Country, Mich.\n\nA male common starling is known as a `` courduroyer `` for its ability to repeatedly tap on a tree to attract a mate. The birds prefer mature trees, particularly sugar maple and poplar, that have lost their leaves. They can lay up to 20 eggs in February or early March. When their young hatch, they leave the nesting tree, which the birds will drop if they are out of range. If left alone after mating, the parents will defend their brood.\n\nCommon starlings are typically nocturnal and will often roost in bushes or large trees, then awake in large groupings or congregate on fences in early morning or late afternoon. They will eat insects and small lizards, frogs, small birds, and spiders. The birds roost so commonly in trees that the birds are often mistaken as urban sparrows.","token_len":393,"entropy":[9.5653,6.1159,4.6388,1.4867,5.9919,2.7725,0.7602,2.4871,2.5172,8.7599,0.9873,1.0781,14.8023,8.9843,0.8326,6.2743,0.2296,5.0759,0.3007,4.3722,2.8438,3.7995,1.5557,1.7362,0.9657,8.5214,7.2599,1.1004,6.2257,5.8373,9.8714,7.4158,7.3132,4.6726,0.5372,3.8349,6.1874,1.348,6.0294,0.447,6.4968,4.9015,8.3519,5.0038,5.2332,0.0298,1.1303,2.7581,3.4242,1.0118,4.4728,3.919,2.5887,7.4973,5.1946,1.8454,2.4706,2.6508,6.8045,1.336,4.2749,0.0015,2.6062,6.518,8.8413,1.1736,5.0819,2.8231,0.1188,6.3011,0.5453,1.4741,1.5755,3.1275,2.3846,4.7445,3.665,1.8767,5.7091,4.1584,3.9322,5.3986,4.8012,2.1659,4.5748,0.9586,5.0314,4.2512,0.8725,1.6816,8.5965,0.7492,7.5218,0.125,5.5142,0.8799,4.771,2.4112,2.3328,4.0163,2.3998,0.1659,4.3777,8.1727,0.3217,0.1296,2.7233,2.385,1.2637,6.2715,3.631,0.0306,2.5802,0.8949,4.4819,13.3402,2.8975,6.3758,1.0768,0.4347,8.3084,2.2505,0.1298,4.4299,0.2916,4.1646,1.2072,1.425,2.3537,5.2258,0.7252,0.4981,6.2616,1.4443,3.3413,0.6799,1.905,4.8171,1.203,1.5663,1.0676,5.1719,0.2505,9.7508,0.059,3.2463,2.9025,6.51,0.3225,2.3478,6.5466,2.3633,5.2872,0.957,2.8097,1.3635,4.6762,2.6439,2.1047,10.3355,7.2577,4.7327,5.9423,5.2958,5.5642,5.5168,5.6076,0.2036,5.1323,3.6591,8.5412,0.0203,1.5292,1.7655,1.7675,2.3358,0.0003,3.5801,3.9813,5.8584,6.0707,8.2437,2.0863,2.0422,2.2479,0.898,0.4399,2.2467,4.5615,5.8391,1.8117,0.513,1.5494,1.248,4.9494,1.0206,4.4706,6.3331,7.0148,5.3502,7.5893,0.1243,2.3331,2.2369,3.3402,1.0952,6.4517,1.6049,7.192,2.1184,4.2072,0.3926,4.0508,8.071,1.2375,4.1785,0.7321,2.2198,0.0002,3.7845,8.1023,5.5796,0.057,0.0512,2.2881,5.3796,1.1818,0.8852,2.8824,11.0546,7.0842,12.1995,4.2782,1.722,3.4673,1.0161,3.7747,0.0041,7.9164,8.1423,3.9824,2.4884,2.2217,2.4483,2.6229,2.5006,2.5667,0.4105,2.1283,4.9639,4.901,6.3738,1.1464,1.7565,3.9603,7.4517,1.6509,2.0023,7.343,0.0505,0.8666,3.1417,1.6028,5.8219,1.1399,2.0523,1.2053,2.9638,2.4916,3.9157,1.9804,0.0074,2.9837,0.6709,2.0038,9.0765,2.2105,3.4116,0.0483,0.9474,4.4779,4.395,3.4568,1.7591,0.2865,0.7728,4.8227,1.4062,6.3451,5.276,3.1986,2.1022,5.4124,1.8533,3.5863,5.9045,6.8762,1.0399,1.9949,5.3353,0.3594,3.5358,0.4234,4.3222,4.3246,1.2298,5.3141,2.8831,0.1903,0.9003,7.4658,2.1224,6.9609,1.3062,3.9146,1.8518,0.8889,0.0002,3.4899,0.1477,0.0455,1.1982,5.1182,6.3759,0.4784,0.0008,1.3315,3.6835,3.3769,6.3304,0.0024,0.9382,4.3976,0.9766,6.094,1.7766,1.8976,6.4807,9.5886,1.6752,4.2754,5.7116,0.8772,3.8702,5.3531,2.4064,2.8565,7.8213,3.9661,5.2007,2.5987,1.9004,1.3586,0.286,0.3205,1.5116,3.0493,4.6472,3.6045,1.2677,3.6173,7.125,0.1384,1.063,7.4443,0.888,4.0892,2.1763,0.9044,1.8,5.2609,0.5339,2.7403,1.8479,7.0795,0.0179,6.8787,7.2506,1.4628,4.5689,0.8036,2.5452,3.2027,2.7813,1.9066,2.677,3.4693,7.4385,3.1761,0.1793,0.015,0.6128]}

[1] As Mexico fought a war with Napoleons France and an inter-imperial war with the United States while a growing number of migrants flooded across the border, Anglo Texas colonists agitated for independence from Mexico. At the same time, the Mexican government was beginning plans to develop the Coahuila y Tejas province, which was becoming the economic base of Mexican Texas. [2]\n\nOne by one, the statutes of independence were passed. On October 3, 1832, the Mexican Constitution of 1831 was declared invalid, and General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna was appointed General of the Army to rule Mexico. He then set about to establish his own government, ordering a census of the Mexican population. He found that Anglo Mexicans outnumbered Mexicans in Texas, but that in many towns the colonists held positions that would make them ineligible to hold office if they were considered Mexican citizens. Santa Anna ordered the immediate transfer of Anglo colonists to non Anglo areas in Texas where they could hold official positions. On December 27, 1833, Santa Anna ordered the creation of the Mexican Republic in Texas, which was made up of what is today the United States.\n\nAnglos in Texas were now free to organize their own government. On March 3, 1834 the Anglo Texas government was founded with James M. Smith as its first president. [3] On July 6, 1836 Austin declared the Republic of Texas' independence from Mexico. The Texas Republic was quickly recognized by both the United States and the Rio Grande Republic. [4]\n\nDuring the next two decades, Anglo Texan leaders struggled to establish their own government while dealing with American and Mexican officials. Eventually many Texans felt it was time to end the quarrels and join the United States.","token_len":394,"entropy":[11.8982,0.6151,1.3357,3.0616,2.9331,6.7619,5.3497,2.2762,1.2233,3.2832,0.0009,1.595,1.825,8.6042,0.3959,6.6645,0.3539,6.9111,6.6652,2.5521,1.4288,6.1255,0.531,5.3908,0.0266,0.0002,11.5014,5.2594,3.2226,1.4408,7.4569,8.2899,0.5861,0.6528,5.125,8.6524,0.0121,0.1937,3.2952,3.9022,0.5845,6.4476,2.4672,0.0466,4.3848,5.794,6.3674,2.5017,2.098,1.2997,9.616,0.1615,5.2647,7.2915,1.0145,6.0396,5.054,1.3996,3.3343,0.0049,1.6039,0.4062,1.3809,1.7078,0.0906,7.2773,5.0761,4.1697,1.7147,0.0288,6.1804,4.581,4.2769,0.2018,1.0828,1.3331,5.7488,8.751,4.9575,9.3999,0.9513,3.4612,1.7488,1.2427,0.771,4.4656,0.6717,0.8212,0.0034,0.3332,1.5516,1.5589,0.7917,2.5304,4.1366,7.2362,0.5043,4.0227,2.6482,6.9903,0.0138,0.0083,2.8172,0.0989,0.0025,5.1769,1.673,1.3071,1.5212,5.5295,2.7757,5.883,3.3297,0.8482,2.9191,7.0098,0.7733,2.1751,0.0915,0.0082,1.5493,0.0032,5.2441,7.0438,0.0034,0.3041,1.3462,10.4961,1.6572,5.8336,1.073,1.2585,1.4362,3.8478,2.9774,3.4441,0.0998,0.2762,1.8965,0.182,1.2445,1.2165,4.4559,3.819,0.5789,2.7102,2.6079,4.9353,3.0488,1.6664,1.1185,7.3127,4.8635,4.9477,1.061,4.3779,1.7187,2.5599,2.1569,4.9832,1.0149,0.5088,4.5659,5.2854,4.4874,2.5788,0.4171,2.8482,5.0563,4.2869,1.2102,4.3962,2.2989,2.8716,1.2292,1.4274,1.6412,5.6138,3.1184,3.9187,1.0471,0.899,4.0472,1.7411,2.0649,2.7768,3.9865,0.7831,7.7015,4.4577,2.8098,2.0225,1.2374,4.6528,1.3059,1.88,1.4824,3.4955,3.6159,5.8987,2.1475,7.57,5.2052,6.4693,2.3228,3.0823,3.1298,0.9226,3.1829,1.1187,2.8475,0.814,4.8072,0.8324,1.5147,5.7585,2.4681,1.7243,0.1653,6.7975,0.0055,3.2955,1.2241,7.156,3.2513,0.069,3.5414,3.5022,0.3359,6.9105,9.4993,4.4247,2.4312,1.6955,4.6453,1.0373,0.7973,3.7082,5.0123,0.6594,0.6564,4.506,2.5437,4.3179,0.1,0.2426,1.2866,0.1371,1.8662,0.0041,2.8299,0.797,4.1203,0.0074,1.5074,2.7754,4.4332,3.2232,2.4601,1.1569,1.4897,1.9515,5.5801,0.5803,0.1341,7.1135,1.9017,1.9691,1.4801,1.3833,0.0173,1.5655,1.2149,0.0002,8.3741,3.9946,3.1185,0.5196,2.0083,5.7694,3.2714,0.3432,4.5845,1.4053,0.3015,1.286,1.2402,3.4079,2.368,3.0469,0.0666,0.1718,1.0162,3.0859,5.576,2.616,3.0338,2.6627,3.2249,4.0966,6.5602,4.3716,0.259,4.6509,0.9321,1.3836,1.7169,1.3887,0.5851,3.5242,0.0235,0.018,2.648,3.0095,3.2165,0.1343,0.3843,1.5735,8.176,4.9072,1.7063,3.4898,1.1917,0.2144,6.4821,1.1662,1.6654,0.6249,1.0048,2.0847,3.4255,2.6221,0.876,6.0772,2.1516,1.0509,3.5409,1.0104,2.4006,0.0074,0.2952,1.5602,8.9464,0.0307,7.8878,1.3569,2.1162,0.0308,0.0124,0.9964,0.0001,3.5058,0.3782,2.8203,1.9295,1.0178,0.4899,2.7628,1.8188,0.4851,2.9701,6.1665,0.5716,3.1263,1.4014,0.3647,0.4282,4.7152,6.3354,0.0349,6.1447,3.445,0.2818,2.9722,0.5063,4.363,5.6337,5.0283,3.7427,4.4872,0.5248,1.1868,0.4561,4.1479,0.7099,7.7228,2.1034,1.958,4.5327,0.7832,3.4325,0.0188,0.6235]}
{"id":387,"ended":false,"length":375,"text":"Wilde's two final comedies, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, were still on stage in London at the time of his prosecution, and they were soon closed as well. A third play, Lady Windermere's Fan, had been produced in the summer, but Wilde's lawyers, who argued that Wilde should be charged only for his last play, prevented that one too from opening. The trial was scheduled for March 12, 1895; the public prosecutor's office had to be reminded that, if Wilde did nothing else in his life, he had certainly written one play, if nothing else.\n\nWilde had not wanted to be in court, even when he was informed by his solicitor, James Dyer, that he had to turn up because his defense team had failed to file all requested papers. \" 'Please make allowances for me,' said Wilde to his solicitor. 'I am a broken man.' He was, we believe, quite hysterical when he entered the dock, and had to be held down by both detectives and jailor, all eager to hear what further sensational things he had to tell us regarding the perversions of society and the decay of morality.\"\n\nWhen Wilde and his defenders reached the dock, he was the picture of composure: \"Mr. Wilde stood facing us all, the picture of despair. His face was white, but his eyes were blue. He looked every inch the poet. At the same time, you could see that he wanted to jump out of the dock and cry like a child... He looked like some ghastly statue in some gloomy museum which moves when the visitor approaches. It might almost have been taken for the portrait of the poet in The Picture of Dorian Grey ; it certainly did not look like the face of a normal human being who has got into some ghastly scrape, as so many of us do, and is being dragged to justice as the result.\"","token_len":394,"entropy":[6.4311,3.4974,6.8677,6.9411,11.1261,0.0006,1.2239,6.9734,5.6678,5.6063,0.0063,0.4409,2.1076,8.174,0.0021,0.2954,0.9621,5.8334,0.0366,0.5446,1.9912,5.7579,3.6239,8.0525,2.1316,3.477,2.9835,0.4095,1.1608,1.8879,2.9309,9.5865,1.9254,1.3602,3.2576,1.2345,5.9039,8.7945,4.2201,2.739,0.2894,4.4012,4.8138,5.1215,0.5713,7.6039,6.7517,1.2589,0.0056,2.591,9.138,1.7186,3.5779,1.0345,3.7305,2.1036,1.9044,2.8986,2.3902,1.2256,11.2122,1.5816,4.6294,3.9398,2.4486,5.6888,1.2439,4.3907,3.3232,1.3991,3.6681,2.8201,1.3585,1.7993,5.7905,3.5979,0.3443,9.1213,3.9315,5.5546,8.8886,2.4668,4.7447,1.0728,2.2805,3.7062,1.624,4.3531,0.8722,3.5295,4.118,0.5748,5.0293,3.5237,1.728,5.6842,4.527,2.1931,0.2083,2.2853,3.5202,2.7978,7.386,1.1215,3.8067,2.6735,1.1337,4.1169,7.2539,5.3569,2.566,1.3647,0.6274,0.6,1.4902,2.8064,6.6442,5.7148,4.3939,4.864,1.8874,5.3784,4.6637,0.0414,1.4258,1.2304,0.0024,5.1382,0.0006,2.807,3.6744,6.7617,0.3445,1.6474,4.0565,2.1134,1.3714,5.1548,2.7687,0.9988,1.0389,7.4985,2.2907,1.3695,4.2987,1.408,4.4994,4.4904,2.9322,0.1462,0.1852,0.8145,1.7154,2.6642,5.3057,2.3808,5.9812,2.2299,5.1802,2.9498,0.8686,4.237,0.1007,4.4498,6.0612,8.3428,1.6679,0.7496,3.2864,10.2845,6.0596,4.411,7.2297,0.5052,2.6867,1.1676,1.7703,1.3021,3.7843,1.7843,1.2825,1.7625,0.1941,0.7944,1.8662,2.9681,9.2015,0.2931,1.4275,2.9526,2.2314,4.7288,6.1176,2.9315,0.0419,2.878,7.5196,3.9268,0.8336,6.6843,0.6605,3.9225,1.8481,0.9584,4.0116,1.3326,1.1943,4.3108,3.7403,1.4892,5.7612,5.7479,2.231,6.1585,10.2585,2.2878,4.6405,8.34,0.1633,4.9803,1.5384,6.8341,11.2847,4.8023,1.1627,1.6321,1.578,3.0592,2.868,7.6542,1.2763,8.8153,4.4326,0.5332,6.0815,2.1947,1.3732,7.7161,0.0518,4.1264,2.485,0.8784,0.0002,3.7586,0.5065,4.2773,0.6325,5.4283,4.9787,0.6038,1.0926,0.7441,2.9831,1.3183,6.1748,8.8814,0.2352,6.3899,4.5357,2.2256,6.0413,0.3576,1.8224,4.8325,6.3498,2.9585,4.19,1.5336,4.6719,6.5948,0.4778,8.1218,2.5196,3.1526,1.7388,0.7883,5.2775,1.1461,2.9294,0.9037,1.4768,0.4036,3.2901,0.9471,0.9919,2.2026,7.0497,2.1229,0.9576,6.5659,2.9374,4.9966,1.3119,2.3849,0.0901,0.638,6.5485,0.9713,0.743,1.6435,0.6655,5.276,0.5502,7.4113,1.9352,0.4241,0.5025,0.3989,1.8339,5.4362,5.3437,0.334,2.4221,7.1451,2.4352,3.1834,1.8775,4.9498,7.4238,0.0558,0.0027,7.9788,3.0039,4.6881,6.5267,5.2614,5.5513,10.2551,5.9277,2.1675,6.8178,4.6771,1.246,2.8853,5.605,6.4057,1.7032,0.333,5.4141,1.0557,3.5251,5.6621,0.5941,2.1431,2.6671,2.8339,5.448,6.0554,0.219,2.5708,0.4401,3.3286,7.8124,2.0011,5.0145,2.7351,0.448,1.3769,0.4078,1.7567,4.0957,0.307,1.0684,6.6952,2.6634,0.1688,3.3141,2.2881,5.3108,2.968,3.4069,7.3992,0.0007,0.0038,8.9114,3.2741,3.9593,5.8488,0.857,1.8655,1.3823,1.3475,1.2758,1.641,2.0628,3.8498,2.393,2.8445,6.4066,4.3487,3.041,3.2484,1.0314]}

He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, and he wanted Irataba to guide them up the Poudre River. The party encountered trouble in a rapid named Rattlesnake Rapids, about 70 miles from Fort Collins. Here, an Indian woman named Chief Washita died from an internal hemorrhage. Ives decided to give up reaching the Poudre and follow the South Platte to Colorado Springs instead.\n\nOn April, the party finally reached Fort Lyon. The news of the disastrous Rattlesnake Rapids was relayed to President Buchanan who ordered Colonel William Gilpin to send a force to aid Ives. The force consisted of soldiers from the 6th and 10th Cavalry as well as members of the Mountain Rangers belonging to the 7th Cavalry under Captain Joseph C. Custer.\n\nOn May, the expedition reached the scene of the disaster and carried on the search by steamboat and canoes. The expedition returned to Fort Collins on June, meeting resistance from the local Indian agency and white traders. They were threatened with fines and jail time or had their licenses revoked if they did not leave the territory. In the end, the expedition was successful and the bodies of the dead were collected and safely sent to Denver for burial.\n\nAs more and more traders and their families were forced to leave the territory, they were replaced by members of various militia companies as well as men from other companies of the Army who traveled west hoping to make a name for themselves. With the arrival of the Army, many Indian chiefs also began migrating toward the area in order to get close to the government representatives.\n\nIn early 1858, the Army decided to establish a military post at Fort Collins. It was first named Camp Dennison and was later renamed Fort Collins to emphasize the friendly status of the region toward the United States.","token_len":394,"entropy":[8.4614,6.633,4.4221,0.2676,5.7026,11.0958,5.6937,0.3697,2.0514,6.0073,3.2909,2.0724,8.9826,6.3841,0.0084,3.9961,10.7833,1.3758,1.4601,1.624,7.1474,2.607,0.234,4.6794,0.8197,5.8948,6.2078,1.9662,3.6882,1.9224,1.9454,2.7835,5.1844,14.9211,6.222,7.3728,0.7396,6.473,4.0049,3.5539,0.9246,5.9542,7.1513,0.9048,0.4368,0.7378,2.4732,6.4798,5.6131,6.167,2.0199,3.9425,8.5929,12.6919,7.56,1.1364,0.0179,0.0238,7.1453,0.989,4.87,5.0028,0.0982,2.685,5.0211,1.6687,0.5598,5.4813,1.2823,4.5379,3.8478,5.3562,1.4372,9.5726,6.7809,4.988,5.1809,3.2781,2.7676,5.363,1.1856,0.033,0.8702,2.5564,0.0027,4.2831,0.2271,4.2288,2.8259,11.319,1.2133,2.9342,0.0055,0.0021,2.7332,4.8613,1.0458,6.4191,4.3914,0.0009,4.9725,4.447,1.1261,6.4538,0.266,1.6698,0.0662,2.9283,2.6638,7.4033,3.717,1.704,5.4195,0.5488,1.843,11.8579,1.4505,2.1325,6.8801,1.72,1.1343,7.1392,6.4277,0.0143,0.001,0.0178,0.3434,2.4527,5.0067,0.4521,4.5266,5.3702,4.165,2.6306,5.6623,4.1419,7.5207,1.4379,0.9698,2.3604,1.4526,3.2436,0.9704,5.8792,5.1305,0.0002,1.0672,2.0459,2.9936,3.3219,0.0354,5.9557,1.1615,0.9719,5.3094,0.0924,2.5047,3.7116,0.0016,2.6919,0.0064,5.3886,0.048,0.0034,4.9574,0.1405,0.2135,7.8141,3.1095,10.0335,0.0057,0.2041,3.7545,0.0202,1.2932,0.0003,6.0153,2.8621,4.4039,3.8392,0.5277,4.6294,2.7022,0.3684,1.9026,0.0002,2.0963,1.0926,4.3132,1.6633,3.0048,2.6405,1.84,7.242,0.1047,0.8638,2.8183,1.6331,5.7772,3.5762,2.2725,2.8016,5.8662,4.468,1.0703,2.8211,7.1681,0.0586,0.4131,1.7998,2.2183,3.9177,0.8899,0.6969,4.4383,1.3691,0.827,5.2611,8.0697,5.6599,0.6015,0.8727,3.9006,2.8937,9.8896,1.4105,7.8948,5.1644,0.6732,2.9631,1.74,6.2779,0.6929,6.356,1.0838,3.1768,0.942,5.2804,6.2113,1.0428,5.6628,0.6093,3.3596,0.1474,1.5186,0.0159,3.6934,1.1764,4.5633,1.0864,3.2274,1.4795,1.0964,0.2494,1.1498,0.9526,1.7293,2.1939,1.1744,1.6039,8.0996,0.7198,1.4644,2.9494,0.5396,4.989,1.761,7.9553,3.6041,0.4405,5.0954,1.3757,0.3544,0.1221,0.4521,0.0002,4.4829,6.3173,2.7283,0.0013,9.6274,1.7681,5.506,1.4353,2.1117,3.8153,0.2635,0.7763,1.1798,2.0436,0.4909,3.3794,2.0319,6.0157,0.2593,4.7187,0.0797,5.88,5.1011,4.9499,5.0308,0.4888,0.1028,4.6568,1.519,2.2805,4.575,3.6171,0.5166,4.1378,3.8996,5.0004,4.2724,7.4721,0.1547,3.4848,1.1659,3.8291,0.0202,0.0041,1.1299,5.0665,0.888,2.6318,0.0138,0.855,3.9427,1.2216,3.3033,4.2668,5.1951,5.6377,2.2446,5.3071,6.3043,1.1196,1.646,3.553,2.3904,0.0137,4.4511,6.1588,0.1473,1.0887,7.4215,8.1761,1.2302,1.3057,0.0002,2.2161,3.7977,1.8325,2.1584,0.1982,1.4095,3.3632,4.3174,0.2685,3.2476,0.6177,3.8077,4.4572,2.0664,1.0044,1.3248,1.1636,2.6714,0.6069,6.4514,3.8732,5.942,5.4585,4.8056,0.3144,2.0744,2.1118,3.0514,0.8892,1.3384,1.9641,5.1408,5.168,0.6319,8.8551,5.6762,0.3037,0.409,3.8941,8.9618,0.2488,1.6785,0.0037,0.1836]}

{"id":1418,"ended":true,"length":300,"text":"The main building activity undertaken during the reign of Djedkare Isesi was the construction of his pyramid complex in Saqqara. Djedkare also either completed or undertook restoration works in the funerary complex of Nyuserre, the palace complex of the 3rd Dynasty queen, Tiye, and the pyramid of Userkaf at Dendera. However, of these edifices, only the pyramid complex at Saqqara is still standing (i.e. not yet completely excavated).\n\nSaqqara: Djedkare Isesi's pyramid complex\n\nThe best known of the Djedkare Isesi pyramids at Saqqara is undoubtedly the great pyramid of Djedkare Isesi himself. To the north of this immense structure are the two smaller pyramids called Khafre and Unas. This four-sided rock-hewn pyramid is covered with a square sloping casing of rock, a typical architectural style of Djedkare Isesi's tomb complexes. The casing is constructed from large pieces of red limestone quarried on its site, all of which were transported to Egypt by the Djedkare Isesi himself.\n\nThis monument has had some difficulty surviving the centuries. The great pyramid was attacked and defaced in the 16th century B.C. (Tutankhamen, the last dynastic pharaoh of Egypt, was buried in this pyramid) and again in the 11th century B.C. (Tunisian merchants robbed and defaced the casing of the monument). Then, almost 3000 years after its original construction, the great pyramid was finally demolished to allow the temple to be built on the site in the first century A.D. The temple was finally destroyed again during the Muslim regime of Egypt in the mid-8th century A.D.\n\nIt is currently being excavated under the guidance of French Egyptologist Henri Taddei.","token_len":396,"entropy":[6.6973,7.154,10.2596,10.1904,3.0701,0.4484,7.5617,0.0916,9.8596,5.2221,6.2673,5.169,6.7764,13.657,1.8572,0.9627,2.8662,0.0378,5.5967,5.9101,4.9325,2.4446,7.8275,3.3241,0.0244,1.3685,3.7376,0.006,0.0042,0.0045,5.481,12.536,3.6175,1.7182,6.1739,7.8773,2.6747,2.1038,1.1018,10.9173,0.0184,4.316,1.593,8.5783,10.5877,7.1489,1.7277,3.0281,5.2451,3.1156,0.5334,2.191,7.7551,0.2422,1.2484,10.7816,2.3961,7.8953,5.4983,2.2776,0.9726,0.8191,5.7173,1.1915,14.4125,5.3756,9.0443,5.8086,4.2202,6.8198,2.485,0.7868,4.7812,0.1792,6.7442,2.2017,12.5091,0.3762,0.0006,1.0172,1.7172,1.5229,3.1655,3.158,3.6634,3.9705,0.0009,0.0011,2.0367,3.8152,2.4994,3.9223,4.3795,0.0017,0.0005,1.5829,3.1857,3.53,4.7285,3.5519,0.0005,0.7732,1.1957,0.0275,5.0504,3.4997,3.8147,2.3514,3.9124,3.1063,0.0229,0.0059,0.0076,1.6926,0.0154,2.2599,2.2999,0.7266,1.8164,0.0002,1.6014,7.567,0.6566,1.9697,1.0714,3.9058,0.0042,0.0106,0.0118,1.1405,0.4098,3.0547,0.0004,4.4566,1.6404,0.0016,0.0011,0.8399,7.7729,0.4722,6.1774,1.6568,0.889,1.1331,0.014,0.0161,0.0114,0.4002,0.0466,5.7114,1.0863,5.8832,2.1236,2.3064,0.6111,2.7867,5.828,1.9429,2.8585,1.6794,2.7444,5.1513,1.2323,0.0075,4.2411,3.746,4.1947,2.0417,0.9428,7.9237,6.0618,1.1459,3.1843,6.7029,0.4179,2.5878,6.3757,3.3993,5.8269,0.0555,1.0258,1.3102,4.8848,0.5797,1.958,7.0084,6.7292,0.808,9.2946,2.5599,3.3422,1.8275,3.6312,6.6829,5.9878,2.9087,1.5528,0.5916,0.0092,0.0032,0.0083,0.4692,0.0203,1.9439,6.4707,5.1683,0.3088,1.2806,5.4627,1.1276,5.2489,2.1448,5.55,4.3761,0.0402,6.843,2.4313,6.0022,0.0055,2.9253,4.8422,5.05,1.9205,4.3516,0.9288,0.1144,1.9923,5.3465,1.1839,7.0624,1.3266,1.6432,4.3498,0.0212,0.0093,0.0802,1.1559,0.2271,5.8812,0.6623,1.8888,0.0002,3.4097,6.994,3.3961,5.1151,3.6121,5.5265,4.6287,2.3709,4.307,2.6971,1.8199,5.4258,1.5431,2.4045,6.5801,2.8107,6.1333,0.2737,1.501,1.7149,3.8117,0.2711,0.1723,6.3432,0.0008,0.0115,0.5535,4.0957,6.3404,4.4115,3.8902,0.5496,3.3363,1.3631,4.1435,4.2841,6.6277,0.2445,6.2795,0.0322,1.0354,3.0302,1.3366,1.7408,4.3205,1.0311,2.4258,2.4596,4.2259,0.9996,6.4878,0.3572,0.6597,5.1844,0.0217,0.2096,1.1651,0.0003,0.0014,0.2123,0.4871,3.0784,5.5998,0.6506,1.8181,9.5924,8.289,3.9564,3.3464,0.0182,0.9795,10.231,1.1356,1.0487,6.3153,1.7325,5.9119,1.7678,6.1006,7.4428,0.0375,2.3537,1.578,3.3276,1.9072,0.2423,1.0912,3.9885,0.7531,0.849,2.5251,2.5557,3.907,4.6292,1.3913,6.1908,0.7048,0.6591,2.3645,2.5074,1.5482,0.688,4.7713,1.4322,4.1273,4.2714,2.4692,0.0002,0.0201,0.1781,2.506,3.9516,1.012,3.2352,3.4224,5.947,4.4947,0.1893,6.6119,6.8045,1.4044,4.3979,0.533,0.9836,4.3799,0.3206,4.7811,0.0113,0.058,2.3428,0.001,0.0081,0.3753,1.7498,0.0002,4.4777,0.642,5.2076,2.3942,1.6411,0.0009,4.2728,0.8202,5.2951,0.0202,7.0626,6.4461,0.1308,5.076,5.1011,7.0339,3.2076,1.6597]}
{"id":2310,"ended":true,"length":361,"text":"In medieval times the township was within the manor of Castlerigg and Derwentwater. The earliest surviving official record of the town is the market charter of 1276 granted to the lord of the manor, the King, by Pope Innocent IV. Although the area was a rural one, the town grew rapidly at the time, and by the end of the 13th-century, the population was well over 1,000 people. At this time there were 12 markets a year, with many local businesses. In 1423, Derwentwater, Castlerigg and neighbouring communities became a parish in its own right, but by the time of the reformation in 1534, only Derwentwater remained within the parish of Castlerigg. The parish was abolished by the Act of Uniformity in 1540. The town grew as a major port for the exporting of coal, lime and pottery to the Baltic. Most of the coal was exported to Hamburg.\n\nCrown Point\n\nCrown Point is the last castle on the peninsula that has remained unchanged since its conception, due to its central location. It was constructed in the 16th century with the expansion of the town, using rubble stone. The castle, like all the others in the area, was constructed primarily to defend the strategic port of Chester against enemy forces from the sea. The present tower house dates from the same time as the castle; it was originally a residence before it became a guard tower. The tower house is one of only two of its kind left in Northern England. The castle is surrounded by a moat which is now filled in. A stone bridge links it to the town of Chester. When the Black Prince and the Welsh army arrived in 1444 to battle in the Battle of Worcester the castle was taken and the Black Prince was killed. They were able to avoid the castle at the cost of many casualties suffered when crossing the bridge. Crown Point is now a popular tourist attraction.","token_len":396,"entropy":[11.0898,0.7569,2.6025,11.3344,1.6099,8.459,0.9329,10.3035,0.9243,0.9381,7.3272,7.6498,11.7497,5.8003,9.7747,3.338,12.4547,1.3363,1.8179,6.2186,4.0121,7.7656,3.6513,0.4933,0.835,1.5999,1.0238,2.1135,10.7828,7.0541,0.9876,4.122,4.7768,9.993,1.2362,1.4827,4.352,1.1137,2.6064,4.7403,0.0345,1.7383,3.7183,4.622,4.175,1.9104,5.917,2.0102,2.0937,1.24,5.9179,1.1498,6.9556,0.9917,4.1018,5.3507,3.6128,0.4463,1.3544,2.2052,5.6876,2.0675,4.8018,0.8017,3.9331,1.8082,1.5641,2.6546,0.9558,2.7053,0.0089,0.1515,2.5186,0.0137,6.4921,0.2287,1.8574,1.3749,3.4573,1.1715,3.7902,0.9865,2.8613,0.0897,0.4799,2.6447,0.3832,4.3946,2.1211,0.3807,3.1182,0.562,6.0107,6.2521,4.9146,1.7139,1.0649,2.5584,3.4988,4.8499,3.2257,1.9429,2.4023,2.4079,4.7416,1.0123,7.2213,0.015,0.3158,3.7464,6.4482,0.0801,0.094,0.8616,7.6362,4.2432,3.1648,2.3477,4.6296,2.4234,6.2264,0.2321,0.003,1.0354,3.3322,2.6305,0.7225,2.7617,0.5558,0.7886,5.8276,0.4687,1.837,1.4126,4.4772,1.001,4.7583,4.1576,0.0078,0.6598,1.8428,3.8047,0.344,3.129,2.6646,1.4334,0.0322,0.0736,0.6542,1.7547,2.7795,1.5082,5.2552,2.0061,0.9053,6.6103,0.0435,9.8337,0.9554,0.6663,0.7867,3.5754,1.5719,1.7236,1.9336,5.514,4.0019,0.6502,5.3889,4.5763,2.6243,1.2465,9.6952,2.0141,4.6101,1.3648,8.2467,0.8414,6.8963,1.2034,2.5885,1.4345,7.0997,2.0817,6.2293,0.4996,0.2915,3.7138,1.731,1.2133,0.6669,6.7688,2.9795,2.0417,0.0039,4.5804,5.1829,6.3105,1.5687,0.0002,2.0538,0.031,0.0098,1.6066,1.8363,4.6667,5.2685,2.664,0.4265,3.076,3.9235,2.7713,3.0173,3.8933,1.5416,2.7239,7.5839,2.7088,5.7913,0.4463,1.9261,6.1696,0.9735,1.7312,1.6384,1.093,4.2126,0.7386,2.0828,2.802,0.0566,0.1157,4.461,1.0769,7.4051,0.1016,0.5973,2.6165,2.6298,7.0546,10.0641,7.9046,2.7524,1.1945,1.4785,3.4025,4.5749,1.9443,2.4561,2.588,1.4395,0.3957,2.4389,0.1611,0.9846,3.7701,5.8627,2.3895,4.6516,0.7667,8.1027,4.286,0.5655,7.4616,3.9998,3.8915,2.3124,3.322,0.7604,4.8262,0.4187,1.2297,7.6685,5.1463,8.4151,6.8661,0.6374,0.8461,4.3313,1.8634,2.4242,0.358,1.0455,4.8096,1.4217,1.0987,3.1625,1.9129,5.5417,7.0961,1.9196,2.8745,0.5947,7.362,1.7361,0.8845,1.1515,1.5065,1.2253,1.6959,3.3086,0.0199,2.6899,0.9619,3.582,1.8499,0.186,6.2357,0.4711,6.2629,1.2183,0.7157,1.4665,2.6171,1.9962,3.2309,0.1015,1.2577,6.4927,0.0065,3.1031,1.6525,4.7224,5.728,3.9282,3.3296,3.7145,4.9384,2.4898,5.0206,3.2084,0.2741,0.3827,4.5151,3.0884,3.5843,1.1356,5.8221,0.6154,9.2899,5.9913,3.9585,1.7268,6.352,4.5596,2.3915,0.8862,3.1955,4.3173,5.6204,4.9875,3.1878,0.861,3.4442,0.028,6.4565,4.2362,1.0827,0.5116,3.4398,2.8556,1.4813,4.8246,0.129,1.506,2.8861,0.7976,7.1452,1.6098,4.0056,0.0068,5.6767,1.6831,3.8294,4.2898,1.0489,3.8643,0.0023,3.2524,0.7823,7.0091,4.4471,5.633,0.3939,3.641,0.7018,6.1468,0.0038,1.4402,2.3626,1.4049,3.2285,1.1679,0.5984,1.4046]}
{"id":2214,"ended":true,"length":352,"text":"After marrying Mary Chappel on January 31, 1828, they moved to Middleburg Township in Cuyahoga County, Ohio in April of that year. It was there that Baldwin joined forces with James Taylor, William B. Chappel, Henry W. Gragg, and William F. Smith to establish the community, Middleburg, where they built their first stone home, the stone structure that stands today. ( A later stone dwelling was built in 1837 across the street). The group named the place after their benefactor, Mr. Smith, the proprietor of a successful manufacturing concern and a Quaker minister and social leader in Middleburg. That same year, he wrote two tracts for distribution among the settlers of Middleburg Township, urging them to adopt the principles and practices of the Religious Society of Friends. The pamphlet was titled \" An Address to the Friends at Middleburg, Ohio : Their Friends in North America \" and the other was titled \" A Remonstrance to the Friends in North America, and to All in the North, for a Reformation,\" which exhorted the settlers to practice such ideals as love, respect, tolerance, and peace.In 1833 or 1835, Baldwin went to West Virginia to teach school. In 1837 he returned to Middleburg and married Mary Ann Thompson. Mary Thompson is believed to be the mother of Eliza H. Baldwin, who was an early resident of Ohio.\n\nIn January, 1836, members of Baldwin's congregation came to Middleburg with other Quakers of Middleburg and other neighboring communities to build Zion Hill. This meeting place would serve as the center for the Quaker activities that lasted until the beginning of the Civil War.\n\nDuring the Civil War in 1863, Baldwin and the other Middleburg Quakers helped the Union forces in this area by providing food, clothing and shelter. Baldwin later wrote a diary to his wife describing what life was like during the war years.","token_len":396,"entropy":[10.7863,6.5915,8.5487,3.2658,5.2331,4.5104,3.2118,3.3935,0.1889,2.6418,4.3239,0.0584,3.3265,3.3308,0.6022,8.9116,3.6571,5.764,2.0978,6.8464,2.3689,0.0083,0.0001,0.0345,0.8165,0.4058,4.2785,4.9817,1.3802,0.8452,0.0447,0.378,4.2185,0.3615,1.9946,0.4063,10.1197,5.9402,5.4471,0.0625,4.8189,5.9388,0.9992,5.4567,4.6437,1.2237,6.42,0.2537,0.3509,0.5979,4.1267,3.8295,0.2789,7.3014,5.5345,0.339,0.9661,2.5562,3.7189,0.0695,4.1641,1.6499,2.8655,0.8638,6.9566,2.7704,12.5496,0.0081,2.3383,2.7527,1.0229,2.9507,3.0414,1.1467,6.8695,4.8266,1.6906,1.7223,8.0076,5.4433,3.0062,5.2387,1.8129,0.5054,5.0674,7.9436,6.7173,4.5158,5.1676,1.0943,0.6988,1.1935,1.4381,3.7668,7.7763,0.5405,0.3012,5.5995,2.2312,5.5327,5.5094,1.591,3.3893,2.1908,2.3315,6.9693,0.1192,0.4717,5.7318,0.0065,4.6696,0.9251,2.9246,5.5952,0.0088,0.1546,2.3082,6.1344,5.349,10.5362,3.3319,1.8337,9.0687,0.1128,2.6339,3.9485,5.5717,4.3006,3.0749,4.0675,0.0037,0.7143,6.1226,1.4854,0.0345,0.3108,5.2198,5.1534,5.3195,4.9221,2.4928,8.3905,2.9818,0.6452,3.8434,2.9506,2.3709,0.0051,4.587,1.1656,6.2452,0.3819,0.0622,3.7742,1.1176,4.1494,2.9963,1.9885,0.3057,1.0343,8.497,1.7231,0.6718,5.6699,1.7846,1.9465,5.9778,1.8192,4.3928,0.9966,8.0017,3.2617,0.2768,0.6101,2.3746,5.4658,1.1364,0.0064,1.2321,1.1668,5.2763,7.4718,5.212,2.1432,4.7985,0.7689,2.2103,0.4899,3.4674,5.4675,1.7471,1.6639,0.2133,2.1234,5.5906,4.2247,0.0356,0.0213,1.336,0.701,2.4057,2.2443,1.3858,0.0256,2.3422,2.6387,1.7937,5.141,5.5691,1.4828,2.4509,2.5876,3.2833,2.5741,2.952,1.4201,5.3706,1.7362,10.6901,0.0944,1.125,1.4633,0.3072,5.8854,5.972,5.5016,0.515,6.9592,1.0842,3.8802,0.1975,4.7141,0.1425,0.5523,3.9692,0.8663,7.4681,0.9525,4.1199,7.3502,0.5018,2.8501,0.201,2.0619,5.2867,0.4234,4.2635,1.4507,0.8774,3.9086,6.0897,1.8516,2.2376,0.8074,1.7699,1.0418,3.9552,0.1743,2.2145,0.0012,1.7301,2.9157,2.2128,3.2167,6.1004,1.3115,4.7739,2.1673,3.7963,4.0823,0.0903,2.4044,0.4135,2.4396,0.0573,7.0473,0.6445,5.8545,0.8369,1.5255,0.8734,1.7331,1.6791,4.0115,2.3787,5.0408,0.2741,6.7477,0.9011,3.3691,0.0004,3.5307,4.7426,2.0755,0.2914,2.5199,0.053,7.5477,0.0289,4.604,0.0588,3.1232,4.18,0.3003,3.7155,0.0032,3.7842,6.5327,5.992,0.1985,4.9231,4.5106,0.009,2.2988,4.1642,5.457,1.389,1.1743,5.2915,8.2437,2.9696,1.6101,3.6785,5.3919,7.5119,4.2728,3.5657,0.084,0.8868,3.8318,1.2662,1.0334,2.4809,0.5755,5.4679,2.3265,6.7391,1.2533,1.1125,3.9267,0.0066,0.2154,1.9467,0.0048,0.3662,1.8198,0.0002,3.3593,0.4154,1.3505,0.0016,4.3009,2.9936,0.2174,2.9734,2.465,2.5636,1.9512,8.4661,0.0051,0.9563,0.0279,4.8362,3.1553,1.7584,3.5397,2.4556,6.6866,3.5839,2.9618,2.4956,2.4551,0.8856,1.5172,3.0823,1.6209,1.3622,3.6978,4.0385,3.2244,1.8605,5.1302,2.7612,1.4941,2.4725,5.2666,3.2106,3.9989,0.7662,0.0014,3.2448,0.6428,0.8963,4.8664,0.6137]}
{"id":1922,"ended":true,"length":333,"text":"One of the first details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, although there has not always been consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, however, Iguanodons were herbivores in a much different sense than we typically think of today. It wasn\u2019t simply that they ate plants, but that they specialized in their diets, focusing on large, tough plants for their meals. These were the plants that we often see today grazing on land, and those are the plants that dominate the diets of grazers. The largest land animals on earth and the most common meat of today\u2019s large herbivores are large predators. These foods are available to all of these big herbivores, but there are only a relatively few who target these meats to the exclusion of the rest. The other key difference between Iguanodon and modern big herbivores is that the latter have much more efficient use of energy than Iguanodon and that is in part because they have a much more efficient digestive system.\n\nA new find shows how an Iguanodon with long, sharp teeth could have eaten such huge plants. The jaw of Iguanodon is filled with holes showing the size of its teeth.\n\nA study of fossil material shows that Iguanodon relied as well on plants as it did on their main prey of herbivores, but it relied almost exclusively on leaves that were more substantial than those found today. Researchers found small \u201cleaflets\u201d within Iguanodon teeth which they identified as leaves which Iguanodon would probably have eaten, but they had a surprising thickness.\n\nHow could an Iguanodon that lived 65 million years ago eat such leafy food?\n\nThis is not only significant but it also shows how many steps there are to understanding the diet of early reptiles like Iguanodon.","token_len":396,"entropy":[2.8006,0.4101,3.5997,7.4926,7.8631,4.8559,7.6338,6.2746,4.5972,1.5972,1.692,1.2957,0.7885,1.4868,3.3922,6.9614,0.5996,0.7851,8.395,0.0809,2.1903,4.0185,0.018,1.2774,4.2262,3.1399,3.8073,2.1591,7.0955,0.0027,5.5177,1.0373,3.115,2.1192,6.552,1.4257,4.7644,13.7274,3.1438,3.1498,0.4421,5.1611,0.0124,2.6483,0.0488,0.0018,5.4601,3.2102,2.0782,5.3165,0.0003,0.5569,3.5628,3.5737,4.4454,1.8887,2.4402,1.1423,4.2044,5.2435,0.7727,1.3267,5.5848,1.1365,3.1904,4.1364,16.6901,7.5399,1.7487,4.9375,1.8512,1.3903,1.9549,2.0983,1.2373,1.0475,1.4567,0.7002,6.0038,0.1699,4.5279,4.4217,2.0576,7.1237,0.4855,5.9325,2.2322,6.0402,1.7791,4.2478,2.0553,4.804,0.4345,4.5037,2.9543,2.2088,1.8104,0.7116,3.6073,4.1912,2.1003,1.8024,10.6106,1.1395,4.0474,1.5683,1.8773,4.0024,3.5393,0.9902,0.3906,0.3372,7.1072,1.0818,4.6675,0.1266,8.2513,0.1555,1.0507,2.635,5.9168,5.473,2.0116,2.7709,1.3667,5.3249,1.4438,1.8149,3.301,4.9583,3.1559,5.5389,0.502,0.2174,3.9317,6.0139,1.8213,0.0001,0.1338,1.6783,3.9475,5.4747,1.6292,3.4787,5.9544,1.2125,5.5871,1.1969,2.6065,2.2185,4.5116,4.563,1.5,0.0,0.0631,0.945,1.7213,3.6094,0.8905,3.596,1.1135,6.7894,0.4714,3.9228,8.6169,3.3281,8.6049,4.4495,2.3524,6.3496,0.002,2.4028,3.2055,1.7526,2.4527,4.1027,5.097,2.6829,0.821,1.3633,0.002,0.0054,0.2671,0.1974,3.2442,4.7383,0.2091,0.0001,0.0674,0.5271,0.4241,2.1465,3.3622,2.3841,3.5598,1.3097,5.1898,4.4384,0.096,2.8462,1.5835,2.7705,0.0066,0.0092,0.8649,3.2057,3.4652,3.9018,4.4624,1.1368,0.9295,1.1592,1.9529,2.3438,1.4324,2.1464,1.5523,3.1386,0.171,0.6619,2.2093,0.0426,4.0971,3.1238,6.7738,4.7939,3.0031,5.3068,2.751,0.0024,0.002,0.0056,4.8681,4.8014,2.006,3.3177,0.2022,2.1304,1.7982,2.0695,5.22,4.5526,2.3441,1.2627,2.1189,3.5017,1.2888,1.8782,0.0039,0.0015,0.0039,1.9472,7.4064,0.1072,5.9242,6.3594,1.565,3.2156,0.4109,1.9801,1.8072,0.7236,2.3599,0.0002,3.2187,4.7448,1.3753,4.7947,7.0722,2.7808,0.5099,1.3368,0.0008,0.0027,0.0792,7.9286,7.032,4.7803,0.1489,4.0359,1.6992,1.8942,0.3095,0.0978,4.5911,5.4206,1.6587,5.168,3.5566,0.0003,0.6507,1.8286,3.7139,2.292,5.6773,5.0331,0.6506,0.0126,5.2219,4.2364,1.6305,4.4893,8.1102,0.5304,2.0006,2.6351,5.085,0.2691,6.1077,2.1338,6.2572,11.4948,5.0077,5.4914,4.5531,4.2098,7.7106,6.219,1.6947,0.0011,0.0016,0.0033,2.7028,4.9238,3.329,4.018,0.2158,5.0717,4.822,5.3433,0.9823,0.0028,0.0263,3.5404,5.0041,0.4644,1.0098,2.7879,1.5004,1.9405,4.2714,4.0213,5.2616,11.0748,1.877,2.2377,0.0002,6.0819,4.5845,3.7933,0.4093,0.0005,0.0006,0.0007,3.4565,3.9721,7.6187,0.2639,0.065,0.0247,2.7994,1.4965,8.0115,0.5912,6.447,0.7302,2.3457,0.0002,3.4623,1.6673,3.3024,4.5437,6.7737,3.7324,1.9452,2.841,2.6027,1.4999,4.332,6.9751,4.9922,1.1167,1.4667,4.0849,1.4517,3.3006,0.2548,4.8976,6.1693,4.5324,0.7662,0.0142,0.0046,0.0443,0.6163]}

You had your turn doing `Blowin in the Wind ` for the first time at Newport and you played a lot of songs that really were a lot of fun.\n\n``But now it is time for you to stop doing shows that were in the folk mold and start doing shows that were going to be in the rock mold.

To this day, he probably is still doing it with his band because he knows them so well.``\n\nBuckley, who has recorded and performed both live- and studio-based concerts with the band, said he has no interest in touring without Dylan. ``If we started to take the band out without him, we ve had some of our best shows,`` he said. ``But the idea of touring without Dylan would be like asking me to jump rope.``","token_len":396,"entropy":[7.8253,6.2087,1.9414,9.3422,9.1607,4.0159,7.7312,10.4063,0.0557,8.7297,11.9491,5.6393,9.6163,0.1894,4.1371,3.5253,11.0268,5.9787,7.3566,0.0698,4.4235,0.9617,1.7467,7.2608,1.3034,11.7968,4.8129,8.8375,1.7664,7.0706,6.1542,5.0645,0.4636,0.1304,0.4731,3.5659,4.9062,2.9533,1.0434,10.7817,3.8733,5.4672,5.9116,2.7739,6.5206,4.0137,1.0077,3.2217,1.5494,1.0754,0.0303,0.0058,2.9837,7.7111,2.1637,2.7475,0.7527,0.4101,0.1768,7.9137,2.0328,0.3463,0.0131,2.3233,3.9287,5.2941,7.621,2.8217,1.9377,0.0449,2.4857,5.96,2.6511,4.4496,2.1606,5.7444,2.3598,0.0374,1.4063,6.3641,4.3718,2.0415,2.5159,0.0022,6.0275,4.3373,1.2343,3.5061,2.1815,5.2691,1.9275,7.7997,4.0616,4.2857,0.4621,2.7032,2.4612,0.3445,1.7461,5.2678,2.8917,1.6441,1.7732,3.2432,3.8224,5.4272,1.3951,4.0052,2.7892,1.4506,6.2007,6.3788,0.039,1.8429,6.3335,0.3709,2.4921,3.7084,1.5343,4.9024,5.4107,0.0422,3.9424,5.6736,4.1541,0.1128,1.6074,2.6404,2.8767,4.9803,0.661,1.4202,5.4613,3.2198,0.1699,0.1584,0.5164,2.3024,0.723,2.2309,5.8766,3.6221,5.7641,3.8263,4.9536,7.1151,5.4929,2.5371,5.3508,4.4946,2.8344,4.2465,2.3782,1.328,1.7394,0.4507,0.6934,0.9863,5.8372,5.9115,2.2959,0.5003,5.5593,0.1671,0.2379,6.3771,4.9504,2.3147,2.3265,0.4651,5.381,7.4835,3.4758,2.538,5.0887,2.9121,2.4103,0.1381,2.4201,1.2716,4.9604,3.5385,4.202,4.1452,0.3541,1.1165,1.6994,4.2986,0.0002,0.431,3.9294,4.663,2.4029,2.9373,3.0148,1.0046,2.6534,0.1691,4.7652,1.7854,4.9545,3.2551,2.5479,4.6118,0.8715,5.9521,5.3603,1.5507,1.5485,0.2964,1.6711,0.3881,1.2125,5.3631,0.3172,0.7024,1.7533,0.3393,2.2476,1.6636,1.117,2.5691,3.7931,5.1094,4.0254,0.3367,2.1145,4.4471,0.3753,0.0002,2.7675,0.0038,4.7243,2.0399,3.2686,5.5907,0.1015,1.6307,1.0413,2.8822,0.0122,0.8215,2.8146,2.7803,6.2033,0.6116,6.894,5.721,0.0264,0.001,1.0556,2.9902,6.1228,1.6793,3.2237,1.0927,6.4853,5.4227,2.5966,4.7144,6.9022,0.3282,2.9156,4.3691,1.5584,4.477,4.4155,5.1075,3.0683,2.7619,4.9881,2.1916,3.795,4.25,5.1557,2.2255,5.6844,0.981,4.5512,2.4451,1.638,0.707,0.0295,0.1019,0.2601,3.0693,4.3002,6.8434,3.692,1.2716,6.6057,2.7019,1.7787,5.9693,4.5553,0.3799,1.792,1.6956,5.8708,4.446,0.0506,0.3648,1.3314,5.437,3.8504,2.5503,3.0478,4.0309,3.0505,2.6682,1.722,5.2202,0.8632,4.017,4.692,3.4771,0.0629,0.7694,3.1651,0.2498,0.0002,2.3772,0.0093,0.0003,3.2126,0.8416,2.2369,4.6691,3.8846,1.9116,6.6541,2.9299,6.2495,3.1882,2.296,0.9147,2.0792,3.2824,2.4663,2.3917,1.6754,0.5664,0.6746,1.3025,2.4281,1.989,4.2466,0.0145,4.3905,5.4871,2.1732,0.8925,0.448,3.5536,3.0348,5.9358,2.8787,4.1168,2.5995,3.7042,2.3062,7.8715,0.3408,0.4235,1.5575,11.9754,8.6952,3.9689,3.8485,2.1428,1.4736,1.5126,2.4312,1.9235,0.6847,0.0547,0.0655,0.1865,1.3825,3.8442,5.1409,0.8471,2.8092,1.3493,2.3586,3.3724,0.9844,2.3024,6.031,5.1751,0.5241,7.7655,7.5167,2.9544,3.4039]}
{"id":4858,"ended":true,"length":339,"text":"Pool of Radiance takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy world, in and about the city of Phlan. This is located on the northern shore of the Moonsea along the Barren River, in the center of the land between the Barren and the Black Sea. Phlan is the capital of the Barren, ruled by a council of clerics of the god Pelor.\n\nPhlan is surrounded by four major territories, controlled by warlords named the Baronial League. The largest of these territories is the kingdom of Orlanth, the home base of powerful cleric Orlan and the stronghold of the League. Next in size is the Kingdom of Trest, ruled by the mysterious warrior-prince Trest Tharizdun. The third largest territory is the kingdom of Kelewan, controlled by the tyrannical lord Kelewan Tharizdun. The last of the Barony's territory is the island fortress of the city of Sartori in the Barren Sea, and home to the most powerful of both clerics and warriors in the region, the mysterious Dracon Prince Khar'kon.\n\nThe campaign is set during the Fourth Age of Middle-earth, some 150 years after the events of Lord of the Rings. It follows a group of adventurers (typically clerics or warriors) sent from Trest to investigate the disappearance of their fellow adventurers from an adjacent country, and is generally seen as a prologue to the events in that country. It tells of both the discovery and the corruption of the city of Phlan, but also takes the party into the very heart of the Barren, to the most remote locations in Phlan (such as the island fortress of Sartori ), in order to recover magical items of power and ancient secrets.\n\nThis campaign is also written in the same style as the rest of Dungeon Fantasy, but has a completely different setting from all other DFC-series products published to date.","token_len":397,"entropy":[3.4092,7.6691,1.8912,8.7877,0.7637,0.9152,1.1756,6.7995,1.202,8.6772,1.1307,2.091,3.7357,6.9014,4.1681,0.6954,3.8228,0.0835,7.3115,6.5964,1.5952,3.7893,2.0121,6.47,2.0445,0.5228,3.8047,2.8711,0.0751,0.6094,7.6071,2.759,8.0167,0.4656,9.3493,0.757,1.6023,1.2406,2.7413,0.5497,3.7725,0.0348,0.4692,4.843,5.6344,0.713,5.9871,0.0268,0.8574,0.9128,4.2151,2.5896,0.5434,3.8522,0.0012,0.481,1.8877,1.7814,0.5437,0.6095,5.7943,0.0364,2.1433,4.7806,0.1318,1.9716,4.7051,0.3642,4.9161,3.7262,0.8447,5.9901,7.2407,1.943,1.4442,2.0091,0.0048,1.9512,0.0056,0.5311,4.4782,0.0929,5.2696,3.2868,7.0914,1.1145,8.3661,0.101,7.0755,0.7971,3.9384,3.7066,8.528,5.6949,6.2006,1.1858,0.8844,5.6869,0.7036,0.3392,2.908,0.446,0.9341,6.3653,0.0328,4.6324,4.4494,5.1984,1.0762,2.7639,3.5359,3.9079,0.1241,6.6922,6.1142,6.0614,0.4422,4.3081,1.8171,5.7951,0.031,0.6854,5.5696,0.7087,9.1753,3.4572,7.4126,0.6527,0.4968,2.9772,0.0139,5.2487,5.0278,1.4181,2.5288,0.0201,1.0415,6.5364,5.5141,2.3494,6.8191,0.2647,4.4307,2.0444,7.2124,3.3572,6.4929,4.1905,5.0016,0.7628,1.7081,4.24,1.5074,2.6804,0.4685,0.4131,1.3044,0.0094,6.9958,4.7079,8.7848,0.1887,3.9048,0.0133,0.6199,6.8066,0.0553,3.0763,2.5143,0.0242,0.8087,2.2439,0.4082,0.038,0.041,0.017,0.2755,0.9634,3.3495,1.6851,1.7674,6.6697,14.8618,2.5813,3.8707,0.3673,0.6593,5.5635,7.423,0.5401,3.4138,4.9685,0.1423,4.7063,5.3413,4.3545,4.1852,0.2138,5.9968,0.0871,1.3657,1.4975,3.2853,3.9991,0.1896,0.6482,3.779,0.532,2.9261,7.0181,6.2723,0.4842,2.1406,2.3317,0.2907,4.0868,2.8243,0.759,5.0575,6.1918,2.1323,9.2285,4.5509,3.209,5.8329,3.2021,3.4744,0.4372,0.6927,0.0002,1.7624,6.3032,2.2193,2.1268,3.2083,0.2772,4.5907,0.9247,2.1877,5.8963,0.0316,0.1465,0.7501,6.6358,5.3228,0.7562,0.4486,0.2163,0.911,0.0779,3.9313,0.1629,0.18,0.0126,0.7832,2.4666,3.2152,2.2959,2.2842,0.0278,2.3209,4.1515,5.1608,5.0468,3.0984,0.5027,0.2975,6.0271,2.6734,5.5935,0.8645,0.8764,3.3509,0.6058,1.7861,0.0511,3.6032,5.4262,2.0791,2.69,4.6508,7.7574,4.6962,1.6333,1.7451,4.4565,7.3063,4.7188,0.5897,0.6899,6.9328,0.0001,0.2536,0.429,2.4244,2.4434,5.2243,3.5073,0.3984,2.3705,6.3667,0.9858,6.5371,0.662,3.5745,1.9044,1.8383,6.7434,0.1623,0.561,3.9961,0.6848,0.9023,0.0045,0.7131,3.5089,1.6493,5.5734,2.9949,6.0035,2.7124,0.6285,5.9077,1.1764,0.0183,0.5076,4.4423,0.2094,1.8911,4.1196,2.1165,5.4178,2.1002,4.5691,1.8908,5.3446,0.0011,4.7795,3.0463,0.0057,0.8569,4.209,0.6337,0.4414,2.2698,0.0027,0.0006,8.5294,3.6298,1.8203,0.016,5.1115,8.2781,2.0159,4.4233,3.666,1.8293,5.9155,3.9586,0.7197,0.7322,0.0002,3.4864,1.3725,0.9752,2.9904,4.82,1.2236,0.8982,4.47,0.7508,0.3279,1.0054,4.4334,0.0147,8.5714,8.2171,1.2228,2.0997,3.7961,1.2724,5.5766,0.8018,1.8061,4.7967,6.1512,1.7695,2.4514,10.7131,4.0158,5.8774,8.0657,6.3951,5.1128,0.0504,0.2609]}
{"id":4899,"ended":true,"length":346,"text":"Reproduction is one of the few times the Sunda slow loris aggregates with conspecifics, as it is largely solitary. One study recorded that the most slow lorises ever seen together was six ; however, other researchers recorded much larger aggregations.\n\nThe slow loris is able to change its body composition rapidly, and is a particularly well adapted mammal in its ability to do so. Its internal thermoregulation system (which consists of a large liver and kidney ) can increase its resting metabolic rate from a daily average of only, to, in just one day. Its liver is also equipped with a unique and highly effective detoxification system.\n\nThis large and impressive organ is connected only through a very short duct directly to its digestive system. This arrangement allows extremely rapid and efficient removal of metabolites as well as bile. The organ is thought to be adapted for efficiency, as a shorter route ensures that most of a typical fast loris diet is concentrated in its small intestine and absorbed in the first half-hour of eating. At this time, the blood sugar and lipid content of the blood drops rapidly and the loris becomes hyperglycemic and hyperlipidemic, or in laymen's terms, \"sugar-happy\" and \"fatty.\" To reduce its food intake to a much safer pace, the loris then uses its liver to quickly release metabolic waste products (i.e. lysing); it then quickly repairs the damaged liver to prevent any damage to the blood and internal organs that might occur from this rapid metabolism.\n\nThe loris only eats when it is very hungry, which is usually between midnight and 4 a.m. and between 8 a.m. and noon.\n\nThe loris spends most of the day in a tree, sleeping. It will go on long walks only after dusk. The loris is so nocturnal that it hardly moves from its tree all day and night.","token_len":399,"entropy":[10.1952,0.8446,3.3507,5.1534,0.231,0.3012,3.1438,5.5566,2.8223,11.4352,3.1565,13.6237,8.6533,5.7831,11.7109,0.0794,4.4932,10.2512,0.829,0.018,0.535,2.1365,3.4876,2.2788,1.5427,6.8535,4.4104,1.1398,5.6271,4.8931,6.9499,1.9913,2.069,5.8474,8.6804,0.7479,4.532,0.2832,6.1288,2.7256,6.1995,3.4117,6.584,12.0621,3.172,0.1344,4.4738,2.6515,5.9251,5.9524,1.8865,3.9074,0.4481,1.9799,2.1953,0.0157,1.9628,4.4259,0.1709,0.1287,3.0345,5.2467,0.009,5.5842,1.3523,3.2022,3.5671,4.8814,1.2916,1.9695,2.8001,3.6075,4.807,4.2263,1.3422,3.6769,4.1892,3.1276,3.2613,0.0067,5.2524,0.3829,0.3396,3.4728,5.4133,6.0153,0.9507,0.0071,0.5435,1.3662,4.0833,2.9317,4.3588,0.0645,1.3298,3.909,6.956,1.077,3.6173,5.9573,3.4742,4.8515,1.2643,6.3522,0.4992,0.0639,3.5163,3.955,6.4397,4.6041,0.1169,5.3365,9.3754,4.5103,4.4119,5.2839,5.5813,3.2057,1.3443,0.827,3.5198,4.937,1.4399,2.2753,5.3552,0.0798,1.1064,5.671,3.9586,2.2805,3.0859,5.2002,0.3896,0.4364,1.7165,1.6798,0.0004,4.1455,5.0882,3.0709,6.3083,3.562,1.2906,6.5702,5.6936,2.9283,1.3908,4.3549,2.4316,5.0033,9.0571,2.3683,2.4598,4.7321,0.9692,0.676,2.084,7.2598,2.4303,9.0293,1.8396,2.322,2.3545,4.8849,0.1856,6.2419,5.0939,0.7418,0.0155,7.1683,0.1407,2.3192,1.8597,4.9894,1.2134,5.4429,0.024,0.9212,5.3713,1.4495,8.8363,2.3712,2.5829,3.7714,8.0593,6.3364,8.5537,1.1224,5.1575,0.588,4.8394,5.9794,5.4225,1.3107,0.062,4.0365,0.9952,7.7795,1.4916,2.9517,4.0805,0.2602,2.6354,7.7278,2.8618,0.9351,6.3826,3.8303,4.7904,1.6211,1.998,4.5357,0.3006,5.574,1.6201,1.966,0.4554,1.1012,6.3265,4.3702,3.2778,3.8239,2.4626,0.7826,0.3053,4.6346,5.3513,3.084,1.9428,1.7556,3.2649,0.1326,3.5566,4.7276,1.9248,0.217,2.311,4.0102,3.933,0.1077,0.1358,1.663,5.3616,3.7634,7.2352,1.7259,0.3025,0.1431,0.4592,2.101,3.5566,1.284,1.8689,6.7585,1.9595,2.3547,1.3653,3.6091,3.0067,2.3111,5.9263,4.1099,2.9892,5.575,0.2909,3.9197,2.0507,4.7721,7.9235,7.9067,0.2452,0.6445,1.282,0.0228,4.2052,3.9009,1.6111,3.1485,0.6888,6.1742,3.7014,5.0924,2.5861,3.2301,2.6107,3.34,0.004,0.0012,1.3042,4.1844,1.874,6.5323,7.0165,3.5031,0.9832,5.2439,8.0909,1.6739,1.8967,1.5163,2.4577,3.9383,3.0815,3.4061,0.9409,0.6679,4.0639,4.4441,5.6848,0.2411,2.884,1.8217,1.6179,2.218,3.9228,5.5771,3.892,0.2779,0.7716,0.0004,1.5064,2.3464,0.0356,6.3511,3.1906,4.0356,1.0183,0.6434,3.791,0.918,1.1292,2.5477,0.9923,3.6152,4.592,4.9489,0.1029,1.8735,1.3999,0.0005,0.002,0.4805,3.0488,6.2364,2.5112,1.1629,0.0004,0.0004,0.0811,0.1545,4.2941,0.6716,3.03,0.0003,1.5348,1.7697,0.0275,4.66,0.9844,0.0147,2.0774,0.282,1.516,1.7937,7.1142,2.048,6.0443,4.1898,2.0191,3.393,4.6468,2.9429,5.1959,2.2833,5.3155,2.4218,3.4555,1.7869,2.1913,1.2596,0.0229,1.9599,5.1291,8.6798,0.0724,0.0002,0.3115,0.6065,6.9196,3.0681,2.4363,1.93,3.1606,7.3981,0.9957,3.2326,1.1172,0.4226]}
