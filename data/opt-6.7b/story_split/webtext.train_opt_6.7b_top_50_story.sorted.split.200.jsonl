I also loved the ending when we find out that there was no murder but that the killer had taken control of Matt's body.\n\nI recommend all of you to read all of these books and find out what really happened in that creepy house.","token_len":204,"entropy":[5.4811,8.1659,5.6501,3.2451,0.1711,6.0692,2.614,0.0233,3.363,5.3018,5.8225,1.3234,0.7831,0.9853,5.2749,2.3382,7.2591,1.1051,0.3013,1.2256,1.7579,0.008,0.8851,1.8898,3.0993,2.5945,0.8334,4.8099,4.9739,1.4772,2.1076,5.9367,0.285,4.8641,1.9602,2.0351,1.9339,4.397,1.6581,3.6215,5.9489,5.6059,0.7403,3.2067,5.0203,4.1757,0.8392,3.1942,4.1612,1.8997,0.4734,1.6805,1.3444,5.0908,1.4665,1.2051,1.2432,1.1558,5.5965,3.0144,4.0657,2.0237,3.9441,4.4769,1.4361,0.0261,1.8407,3.8234,2.4919,1.3658,3.521,0.0701,4.785,2.8509,0.9652,2.6014,0.593,1.3346,0.6897,1.2156,0.0003,3.6078,5.3239,1.1775,3.4864,2.358,1.5078,1.8627,4.4754,0.8524,2.2812,2.5175,6.7221,4.3322,3.3969,1.5268,0.3855,0.251,1.6324,3.5742,4.3064,4.7862,0.8422,3.4896,1.1284,3.9404,3.2162,6.2272,1.0086,1.9054,1.7006,4.9814,6.1487,2.9327,1.0101,3.4585,2.1975,0.0582,0.8703,2.6288,1.8617,3.5157,1.4399,4.477,1.5797,4.1292,8.7756,3.8917,1.9561,5.0059,2.174,2.2131,4.8637,1.6012,2.9439,1.954,6.4615,4.2541,4.8082,0.6538,7.1293,2.304,1.4643,7.2215,0.1897,2.9055,1.3314,1.9545,3.6189,5.2141,1.3663,1.6433,1.1306,2.0052,3.0183,2.463,1.1213,3.9632,1.5431,2.6582,2.7117,0.156,0.9047,3.7056,2.0902,3.3728,6.0791,4.5131,2.0235,1.8419,2.5173,2.7109,4.4286,4.3276,0.3567,2.8838,1.4111,1.6986,0.4494,1.4153,0.0002,1.9541,6.2092,4.8191,1.4053,3.1726,1.1717,0.5627,4.213,0.6894,2.082,0.3808,1.8686,3.5168,0.7946,1.2061,4.2017,0.9833,2.1148,4.4645,8.7446,3.4952,0.6918]}

Most of the chapters are self-contained.\n\nEach chapter has links at the bottom to more information and sources for further enquiry.","token_len":209,"entropy":[5.385,10.3359,0.0164,1.0317,2.6307,3.6355,0.9395,7.2619,6.3327,1.9341,7.7037,3.7113,0.5693,5.845,0.6853,5.7758,4.2597,5.6917,3.5531,5.3859,2.7136,3.6081,2.457,1.438,3.2936,0.7855,3.8038,3.5681,0.9278,1.6018,4.5709,2.9828,2.935,7.3149,5.3519,1.942,0.5365,2.0628,0.0503,2.2086,4.6382,2.066,6.0254,2.2593,0.3525,7.9935,4.4067,2.0713,3.7829,1.7089,5.0488,0.0429,5.9076,6.1935,9.2018,5.8738,2.918,7.6301,2.2197,2.0406,2.0129,4.6579,3.5742,0.6545,2.3054,1.6008,1.4743,5.0683,2.3486,2.9603,1.0566,3.4858,3.8412,3.4666,0.55,6.6111,0.0003,3.6117,4.5776,3.582,3.3716,4.4669,4.9519,2.2042,2.1849,1.7991,0.8695,3.4836,2.9727,5.5876,0.0754,2.6269,0.3516,2.6446,5.2155,0.7977,2.6157,4.1766,3.9221,2.2543,0.9217,3.8384,2.6026,1.8609,0.9169,6.3889,5.6685,2.5853,2.2253,0.7347,2.0691,2.6031,0.8439,1.4053,5.6832,2.0572,5.4603,2.7488,2.0914,3.0039,1.5875,1.297,1.9073,2.0169,5.4659,1.5991,2.7086,0.1406,0.0258,1.8264,0.31,2.2918,1.1893,2.088,0.0405,1.0913,0.3266,1.5671,4.4249,1.3819,5.313,4.1451,3.6152,1.2174,0.5699,3.7381,2.2966,5.6431,0.1427,3.7724,1.5229,5.5968,2.8515,1.1601,4.62,0.8676,1.2502,0.0002,2.1222,0.6955,5.1811,1.0894,4.8048,6.783,5.5425,1.6285,5.1876,3.029,0.0681,3.3426,0.0295,4.8076,5.0875,3.3549,7.2586,0.5151,3.4015,2.1057,2.0743,0.992,6.5096,0.6577,0.5968,4.1707,0.9211,4.1826,0.0706,0.743,2.5235,2.3655,0.0002,4.6407,0.3572,2.9372,6.1549,6.1992,0.1423,3.1484,1.4823,5.0044,1.4072,2.6119,7.4762,3.5732,1.9407,6.8816,0.7949,0.3503]}

We look at the evolution of the robot, and how we can train robots to respond to human desires. Students also will gain an understanding of the human mind, the power of perception, and the relationship humans place on robots as companions to help those in need.

You are tasked with analyzing an old robot's code to find out as much as possible about humanity.\n\nThe robot in question was a childlike robotic construct, a robot who knew how to sing and play the guitar, and who made music that was simply delightful. The problem is that the robot was built by an unknown artist, who had no concept of the robots programming. So not only do you have to figure out who put the robot together, you are tasked with creating a code that can interpret the robots personality and help you learn more about it.\n\nIf you like robot games, you will absolutely like this one. The game is very colorful, very cute and very musical. Once you understand the coding, all your favorite songs will be available to play at any time. There are hundreds of songs to chose from, and each one comes with instructions on how to use the robot, or the song, and what buttons will do what.","token_len":214,"entropy":[6.9783,0.7512,3.1342,0.5978,8.1827,1.9519,5.8086,7.1141,2.2915,8.0384,1.0442,0.5316,0.9186,3.5515,0.6701,5.0684,3.1075,3.9377,12.2512,6.8332,0.0451,1.3035,1.6654,1.5392,3.5536,0.1883,5.0995,4.6397,4.4713,8.3519,3.5186,5.795,2.1564,1.8126,2.0366,6.6384,0.1812,0.9843,0.4323,0.2395,6.0933,2.0956,2.0356,0.0036,2.8039,2.7008,4.66,0.2474,2.8823,1.5651,7.317,8.3174,5.3515,6.094,2.185,3.3525,3.1727,2.6829,5.2791,1.9329,0.0104,6.6925,1.3206,2.6082,2.8782,1.8446,1.8229,1.3989,1.9411,5.2077,4.0173,2.6321,1.8697,6.3766,6.132,0.9003,2.267,5.6866,2.0565,0.7919,2.043,1.8606,1.6534,4.8963,2.5875,2.8465,2.7325,3.3597,1.1436,1.7926,2.0732,1.233,4.3902,0.1091,2.3844,4.8528,5.5372,1.452,3.5356,7.1735,0.2021,3.8062,0.6257,1.0049,0.5069,3.2959,0.1004,2.5353,5.163,1.1033,2.4931,2.208,0.3882,1.39,4.3508,2.5313,0.1483,3.7222,0.993,4.3657,0.7348,2.2622,6.1664,1.2952,4.2648,6.5336,1.3671,5.0454,0.816,4.219,1.19,0.0488,3.4091,0.1692,0.5465,0.0002,3.8197,0.2625,4.9459,3.9046,3.4889,0.4188,1.0525,1.6953,4.7339,4.9008,1.0135,1.819,0.319,2.4509,1.9498,0.9563,3.3904,6.5095,0.8131,3.5261,5.0501,1.9621,1.6466,7.5414,0.4782,6.381,0.1407,2.9806,0.9854,4.3785,0.7288,5.6168,3.3198,4.1552,2.1852,1.3414,1.3705,2.995,1.6181,1.2907,3.7525,2.1012,0.4316,0.4831,3.0957,0.7565,4.9506,0.0868,1.8659,1.8986,6.8058,0.0133,0.7771,1.302,2.7034,2.1619,4.1906,0.2208,5.4868,1.332,0.0818,0.0212,3.16,2.1943,2.6105,2.6722,5.015,3.8398,3.7871,3.86,1.9038,3.1688,5.9963,3.8307,4.4592,0.4459,0.4235]}

Is it a case of the photographs being real while the person inside the picture is not real?\n\nWe know that you are interested and that is why we have put together a short article that will hopefully allow you to understand further what we mean and we will also do a little research for you.","token_len":221,"entropy":[3.7506,3.3198,2.6769,0.0879,5.8176,10.009,5.4534,0.6832,7.1746,2.3243,1.2911,2.0876,11.0995,3.7079,3.3761,3.9737,3.7855,2.8887,6.3847,7.1813,1.1224,6.2201,0.99,1.591,3.1491,7.7596,6.0596,5.6229,1.3422,3.7071,1.9566,1.9272,4.2588,2.8133,0.0604,2.3621,1.8012,4.3756,0.6037,5.0426,10.9903,0.3852,0.7806,1.4181,1.8179,2.4777,0.3211,0.6136,5.3301,0.3404,1.1906,0.581,0.0874,0.0257,5.7955,2.2552,6.2671,1.8003,2.6748,0.382,5.729,2.6118,4.1144,4.7651,0.5984,3.189,0.3023,1.5159,2.9249,2.2388,3.4904,1.0841,5.6739,5.3368,1.0313,5.164,2.2167,4.2607,0.5456,1.2252,1.67,7.8595,4.1673,2.27,2.0344,0.8697,0.6227,0.817,3.2622,5.6895,8.315,1.9753,0.462,0.2235,0.7073,8.8038,5.4935,0.3729,0.2241,4.3417,1.3923,4.4717,0.7818,2.1706,4.4918,1.4605,0.2623,5.9787,0.6011,1.3424,0.0108,4.0011,5.398,2.1749,0.7043,2.1636,3.5203,1.5105,4.3323,7.5387,0.7024,2.8873,4.8736,0.2222,0.1655,0.6238,0.6615,5.2725,3.2404,15.6887,6.6422,2.5949,3.669,0.4911,3.6424,0.5461,2.8935,2.5065,5.7462,1.1062,2.5276,1.6993,3.1066,2.4912,0.3791,7.1572,2.1107,0.7174,0.4996,2.5726,0.6325,7.1398,4.3305,4.6043,4.164,3.3127,0.0054,5.4734,4.2716,1.8213,2.243,0.28,4.3512,4.7772,0.1447,2.1908,6.0464,1.0219,1.643,4.9267,2.2194,2.6092,4.1343,1.2305,2.833,0.4844,1.9585,1.9847,0.6499,1.5656,0.0002,3.0625,3.0136,0.4344,3.9213,1.5772,2.793,4.5443,1.9584,4.2743,0.4166,0.4782,1.4197,3.4162,0.6349,0.9227,4.1927,3.9195,2.3933,1.9605,5.1114,5.4135,0.1153,0.1127,2.021,6.4118,2.0566,1.9994,1.1137,2.9233,4.9185,2.1323,2.4456,5.4323,2.1292,3.1887,1.7839,3.4383,0.3752,0.8098]}

Tell us about the arrival of the Humans.\n\nThe humans arrived at the same time as the first dinosaurs, about 65 millions years before the earth started to get very warm, a fact that was probably due to the fact that they were an ice age race. A warm climate was more suited to the dinosaurs, so the ice age came to an end and the earth began to warm, bringing the humans along with it.\n\nThe Humans were a peaceful race and lived along side the dinosaurs, until they became increasingly better adapted to the new climate. When the ice age had ended, the ice that had covered the earth for many million years gradually melted as the temperature rose to its present level. Before the disappearance of the Ice Age, a meteorite had entered the solar system and knocked out the atmosphere. This was a major factor in the change in climate, and had resulted in most areas of earth becoming uninhabitable. The only places where the climate was still fit for life were places like the Mediterranean and Southern Europe.","token_len":226,"entropy":[5.6491,0.0021,1.6575,3.9442,2.7932,2.2962,2.7831,0.0738,0.8371,0.3261,2.7984,7.6565,4.4178,3.9618,1.4797,5.8858,0.842,0.5025,0.9293,9.4982,0.9789,1.4302,1.8465,8.8598,0.1421,0.9664,10.3725,1.4193,1.1409,0.0013,4.0973,2.7187,3.301,2.2006,0.9643,5.2011,0.3354,0.5412,0.4849,4.9676,8.8039,1.2396,3.1727,5.6887,6.4109,0.1787,2.0916,0.7212,6.3785,3.912,0.6429,4.0376,6.0106,1.4611,2.1205,4.6196,3.0711,0.5405,2.4646,4.4571,3.2551,0.1965,0.75,1.4358,0.043,2.0029,1.1628,5.3432,6.2436,0.563,4.5578,1.1587,4.544,5.924,2.6029,2.0228,5.3639,5.853,0.5107,1.4566,4.786,1.8101,3.0277,1.5893,5.2959,0.3187,4.2915,2.3271,0.627,0.1077,3.1183,0.8308,5.3718,1.2319,0.1518,1.1335,2.7404,5.7216,2.3019,3.1234,3.8802,1.6916,0.3672,0.1416,1.1598,0.0002,1.9087,2.8209,1.71,2.7711,5.0532,0.6673,3.3235,4.1322,6.0656,3.4347,0.5454,0.7885,1.0703,4.8114,1.7455,3.0552,5.6646,11.0784,3.8143,0.5169,1.0438,3.1843,1.0482,0.5892,3.8195,0.813,4.1398,0.2942,4.5823,1.2538,0.2874,0.7796,5.1754,5.5164,1.2017,2.1782,0.3732,2.4356,4.3535,3.9753,3.8602,0.0083,4.8721,0.9661,4.5403,1.0753,3.6156,2.7641,2.6416,3.1558,1.9256,0.9035,0.493,5.6919,1.003,9.0506,0.0246,0.3721,3.2877,0.057,0.2458,4.064,6.4072,0.726,2.9723,6.123,0.2379,6.4728,0.0079,1.4204,4.324,1.1767,0.9728,6.1498,1.2487,2.1644,2.4692,2.3352,2.506,5.2589,0.7402,0.597,4.2896,0.7186,1.9716,1.1776,1.4385,5.0324,4.268,0.0063,7.0241,5.6994,0.3719,5.005,1.5658,1.7172,0.0,0.0115,0.9746,1.8751,4.5622,4.6308,1.4096,1.0465,3.954,1.7168,2.6222,7.4896,0.8678,1.3834,0.5474,4.8231,0.8291,1.5169,5.9038,1.3191,6.3404,3.8001,0.6273]}

It captures the grief in his words and makes you think about how we all need to take good care of the ones who we love.\n\nOther stories are quite enjoyable, and I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys short stories and poetry.","token_len":227,"entropy":[9.101,3.4454,6.1839,3.1031,1.8161,3.9705,2.4926,5.2403,2.794,0.4533,1.4967,3.4775,2.48,7.2973,4.0165,0.8723,2.1221,3.9637,1.3011,5.1528,5.7141,0.2888,2.425,6.7115,9.8347,0.9898,7.8967,2.1089,1.7213,3.2766,4.2092,0.776,3.2079,1.3147,3.996,2.2931,0.4732,7.0484,4.9392,6.9401,4.5955,3.5051,4.9224,6.6311,7.6072,4.5891,9.3209,0.9483,1.9844,0.0843,2.996,5.0827,1.43,2.0298,3.439,0.0216,5.4032,2.3612,0.1673,2.3309,5.2209,4.3782,3.1978,3.6005,3.5896,1.818,0.7553,2.3082,1.8967,1.9511,3.7369,1.0749,1.0466,5.6127,4.4488,0.2867,0.6213,4.5313,2.1106,1.5048,3.9872,3.3217,1.3847,3.3682,1.271,4.0661,0.0486,4.8477,0.2584,1.3375,1.606,1.5999,2.1786,4.5872,2.4036,0.9745,2.6152,0.1061,3.3218,0.5687,2.0107,3.0967,4.9651,1.8636,0.5754,6.1107,5.4633,0.3266,1.8117,1.2892,1.4323,6.2524,1.0643,1.4192,1.4257,1.3484,2.4817,1.3795,3.0602,0.2959,1.7571,1.3149,3.7207,6.2918,1.1211,1.1622,2.7491,5.07,3.2695,2.4151,1.5342,4.8361,5.8209,6.6674,5.4104,5.5555,2.6507,0.0351,5.0827,4.0818,0.2582,1.0311,0.0004,3.4259,4.9269,1.7351,2.6043,0.8133,0.4635,1.5458,4.4397,6.4154,0.3021,1.7063,0.108,1.3942,2.2979,2.2441,4.937,1.3655,2.873,0.1843,1.7905,0.5092,0.9813,3.4527,2.2935,2.1982,1.3286,3.3127,1.7198,4.7979,2.5653,6.4015,5.2438,4.7712,1.4123,1.7386,5.2052,0.699,6.5596,4.144,3.6819,6.7025,0.9352,4.0317,2.3016,2.1758,0.9949,1.8801,3.551,2.1651,3.7747,0.5086,3.6799,6.2415,0.0485,0.0198,3.9402,6.1752,1.9674,3.4881,0.4248,0.6336,1.3781,0.0005,6.6138,3.9323,2.1233,4.941,5.1567,1.9865,2.7175,1.7117,2.3189,0.7473,2.639,0.4654,0.6953,0.9863,2.3887,1.0101,0.2887,2.6745,6.2373,0.2763]}

It features guest vocals by a diverse ensemble of friends and fellow Nashville-area musicians including Ryan Bingham, Sarah Jarosz, Steve Earle, Matt Nathanson, and members of The Band of Heathens.\nSpace Docks will embark on a 12-date tour this fall, including dates in their hometown, Chicago and Seattle, in addition to stops in Texas, New England, and Southern California.\nStream the album below.","token_len":232,"entropy":[7.298,4.0027,4.8371,5.8421,3.6376,5.5084,4.303,7.0116,1.2938,7.955,0.6578,0.5809,7.7725,6.3893,3.773,8.5738,2.6349,5.9104,2.7466,2.5208,1.9259,6.1087,2.8992,1.7063,1.7422,11.3671,3.8607,0.0356,9.0075,3.2694,8.0353,0.0877,0.0056,0.512,2.256,5.4598,5.4798,0.1247,0.0357,0.0956,0.0525,0.1443,0.0037,0.6194,2.2192,3.773,0.2462,0.0044,0.023,4.012,15.7043,8.9576,4.7504,4.9952,0.0149,0.0819,0.0,1.0721,1.1896,0.4953,1.2311,1.7745,1.8846,5.6173,2.5817,2.9953,3.6418,0.6983,4.7392,0.1481,3.476,3.0154,0.1999,3.045,3.2791,2.6438,8.2856,0.6569,2.3913,5.4424,12.1672,6.7681,5.7335,7.368,8.8288,3.967,6.7885,7.0394,4.8854,6.4001,0.8305,0.9256,4.5167,2.3,6.9226,0.9487,0.2068,9.7532,1.8037,0.0341,7.0923,6.5576,4.4959,2.9369,5.3534,4.8323,6.1303,1.7673,1.2899,5.5151,5.696,4.3939,0.0837,9.4954,2.9081,7.6134,1.5218,5.8513,0.7568,4.3148,3.792,1.201,5.9217,6.7963,0.1077,4.8664,1.365,2.1264,8.4803,0.001,0.0057,1.1783,1.595,1.4461,1.9419,8.8763,0.5059,1.795,0.4876,5.4234,2.9969,2.4059,2.2465,2.5997,2.5532,5.1224,1.4332,1.0864,4.3308,3.529,4.5016,0.8222,5.5221,1.2787,3.0893,2.729,2.5199,2.0545,2.904,2.9101,4.5817,9.1437,0.4611,0.506,6.9881,8.1651,2.6027,0.2843,0.4433,5.5961,6.2587,0.1691,0.3641,4.239,9.6132,0.1028,0.3158,2.405,7.7963,0.025,3.2173,4.8883,2.3134,10.0687,2.2038,0.6978,0.695,2.6798,0.0288,0.0108,3.0921,3.5072,0.0508,0.8426,5.1813,0.0605,2.4452,0.7961,2.6831,0.8802,1.4387,1.9241,2.2015,0.5479,8.0913,0.4687,2.5901,4.8763,2.3202,4.2393,1.063,4.678,1.8993,0.0008,4.1772,0.3118,5.7426,0.3984,1.7221,4.6382,0.2837,1.2374,5.2501,0.041,0.2178,1.1569,7.6781,1.0877,1.3075,0.8361,1.0315]}

I know that some have tried - and some have failed - but the idea is brilliant if the human being in question is sympathetic and the beast is frightening.","token_len":235,"entropy":[6.0771,3.5213,11.2341,0.9155,7.9081,0.4334,1.8877,6.4778,3.7741,1.5673,3.2797,7.0597,2.9302,1.8296,5.0728,0.4517,4.71,1.4564,1.4476,5.5915,4.1566,2.7527,2.8912,1.3209,4.7438,3.157,1.9436,6.808,5.154,0.6277,1.6947,5.1485,4.1215,4.957,6.1636,5.8305,5.6877,0.8186,4.4544,4.5751,1.482,3.888,3.6016,0.6292,5.9379,0.9768,1.6994,1.6201,6.7483,4.9937,1.8936,1.6805,2.2283,1.7678,2.4455,1.0813,4.8583,2.0419,3.1469,4.6563,1.0628,1.5446,3.8645,7.4827,6.5205,1.8001,1.2014,3.5906,3.617,0.7799,3.3139,3.653,3.5451,2.6278,4.7504,4.1477,3.5975,8.7899,2.379,6.1477,3.8985,5.391,4.2741,8.626,1.9385,3.4217,8.7705,2.7728,6.2206,4.9939,2.2516,3.4954,1.8388,1.4755,0.2948,0.4438,0.7827,5.0754,0.8735,4.4204,4.6185,3.0408,2.7985,0.8083,3.5787,1.1727,0.1207,0.2564,1.0204,2.2271,1.5528,2.2133,2.079,5.6028,5.8415,4.1318,5.2382,2.6255,1.0462,3.8447,3.7112,0.4698,5.5938,5.9693,3.5903,4.0981,3.0785,0.6919,5.9888,1.9712,0.8924,5.2916,3.922,2.1442,0.0013,4.4896,4.2467,0.1518,5.3435,0.6874,5.6474,1.8923,2.4446,2.4784,1.2854,5.397,3.9489,0.3783,1.6534,3.0559,3.9633,0.9509,4.2231,1.6664,7.0636,0.5614,3.5035,6.7097,0.1959,4.0223,5.8758,1.8609,1.6524,0.0094,3.7414,4.5138,3.1379,0.2187,5.1909,5.3347,2.8807,0.0646,1.1324,1.1129,5.6288,4.7155,0.975,0.9623,0.2604,5.9521,0.6526,2.3599,6.1833,3.8969,0.182,0.7003,7.0534,0.859,2.2023,7.7533,4.7598,2.8307,6.9604,6.7682,2.5715,3.3202,4.0619,6.7125,1.0805,2.7944,0.9945,1.5537,0.6209,2.2573,3.6486,1.6832,3.3881,4.1371,2.9807,7.0405,1.7343,3.468,1.1113,1.2612,0.2002,2.4186,3.0557,2.2594,1.8981,7.4109,4.4937,3.3116,3.6197,2.8878,3.796,0.3597,0.7981,7.8907,1.7884,4.0576,6.2914,1.1067,6.4877,0.714]}

But now people keep on repeating it as if it's the solution for not getting robbed. And because of that, it will spread and people will get this idea.\nThis is one thing that I find funny.  People are afraid of being robbed because they think only criminals are willing to commit crimes.  Yet when they turn on the news or read the newspaper, it seems like there is a new story every day of people being robbed by family\/friends\/neighbors.\nI can say with some authority that most people who commit crime do not know anyone that knows police or is connected with them.   It takes years of drug dealing, burglary, robbery to even meet any of those people.   No, most criminals are people that work for a criminal organisation and only their bosses, don't work directly with criminals.  It's the small run gangsters that often know criminals.","token_len":252,"entropy":[3.8828,5.4821,3.172,5.2977,1.3891,8.0831,0.8706,1.2159,2.0015,1.6744,5.797,1.8077,5.351,2.8366,0.0107,1.5864,4.5467,1.5098,8.1912,4.8266,1.7556,5.9501,3.3621,0.8116,0.1597,0.613,1.4247,4.2095,1.5513,0.2513,2.3956,2.8861,3.7869,6.0782,0.8221,5.8037,3.2392,1.5688,0.0791,0.0533,0.1715,8.522,9.8913,5.1662,1.2625,0.4007,1.9522,4.8311,0.4932,3.1755,4.7684,0.0994,6.682,0.1624,2.2665,1.7912,5.0103,0.7202,4.7079,1.7167,6.0959,6.3273,6.5786,0.1345,1.5751,0.3606,3.4052,10.6287,1.0154,3.8211,4.3698,6.2917,6.9683,4.3295,6.2645,0.9448,4.3073,1.066,0.4965,1.242,2.6936,6.9075,4.1128,7.1614,3.2072,5.0367,0.6172,3.2183,5.3846,1.8155,1.3086,0.5091,2.0227,5.3021,5.0899,3.4621,2.9225,0.627,3.4781,6.8815,2.1502,1.8714,1.5717,3.6081,0.7482,3.8768,3.6708,1.0452,1.9677,4.4993,4.2382,1.3392,4.6798,3.5218,2.3183,3.5267,1.0332,2.2895,0.8138,2.0719,0.7116,1.7156,6.5635,3.3577,1.7908,4.7969,0.022,3.4123,1.4213,0.5691,0.7238,6.1254,2.7869,1.8842,5.9191,1.7986,0.8501,2.771,3.2129,2.6825,1.8279,2.4717,0.6804,2.9541,2.8094,1.1067,3.2028,0.9881,1.2066,3.4859,4.6514,2.5286,0.6005,4.49,1.816,0.9333,0.1021,2.6896,7.8694,7.4363,0.2948,2.6373,6.4362,0.0181,0.1621,0.9062,1.9413,2.3608,3.5905,4.9574,2.0369,3.1665,4.471,0.1881,4.0258,1.2789,2.0382,3.6214,2.6539,2.2576,0.6831,2.366,3.577,3.8304,3.2159,7.4119,1.6452,5.9349,3.5844,1.9894,1.836,0.2758,0.2945,4.8458,3.3035,4.6066,3.3581,1.5453,7.4664,0.9579,1.1384,5.839,0.3314,3.0999,2.8779,4.9559,5.9601,3.9579,1.0345,1.9675,0.6196,0.476,0.4623,0.8433,5.8076,3.2936,4.4972,3.2052,2.0697,5.2929,1.7901,4.9554,1.704,1.8252,4.6698,4.9287,2.4472,5.2642,4.7962,4.442,4.1102,7.4521,0.0856,3.8638,6.2796,1.1148,4.4586,0.5006,0.4001,4.4307,1.5649,3.4399,6.6378,8.5916,6.8857,4.4537,1.2242,5.0026,6.1611,5.1908,1.3425]}

Mr. Bloomberg said he will ask the State Legislature to expand the program to serve up to 40,000 children in the fiscal year beginning on July 1.\n\nAt its first hearing in April, the City Council approved the proposal, which is tied to the state budget.\n\nUnder the program, run in part by the city Department of Education and in part through the New York City Charter School System, working families with children younger than 7 can get eight hours a day of care for their children for a full week for only $25, down from $85. The program is open to the children of city workers, not just city residents. It is supported by a grant from the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation.","token_len":254,"entropy":[7.7656,13.4775,8.6087,2.5499,5.6215,11.2331,14.1588,1.0597,6.0461,4.6461,4.3485,1.5797,0.0241,2.3694,2.0804,0.4666,0.3972,0.1475,0.0907,0.0707,0.3696,0.02,0.0268,0.0726,0.493,1.0496,0.0003,4.4128,3.6639,4.8637,4.4238,3.3128,6.2982,5.8344,0.4518,3.8792,4.653,6.9431,1.5025,0.3298,6.4009,5.0597,7.5067,2.3849,1.5916,5.0751,4.7563,0.2326,5.3979,1.7128,0.1165,1.8278,4.5877,0.383,1.5998,5.6318,4.2964,0.7345,0.8207,2.7153,5.1183,3.1568,5.1426,2.1261,4.5331,3.7312,0.0267,0.3825,0.0601,0.3676,0.6071,0.0003,1.291,5.7908,2.0873,3.955,5.637,2.5693,1.8769,4.0002,0.0339,0.0009,0.4512,0.4427,0.1997,2.9991,5.6733,0.1298,1.3558,0.665,1.6696,3.1382,2.1198,5.6531,3.8968,4.0268,5.7108,3.8083,4.7682,0.9756,6.7456,9.4899,2.3364,1.9959,6.3142,2.0693,0.332,6.7328,0.0011,0.2501,0.8465,1.8824,3.2471,3.0376,1.5964,2.8376,1.4638,0.2715,1.8244,0.409,0.2559,1.8549,6.6025,3.4797,0.0184,4.104,1.5533,0.004,1.2436,2.3535,1.531,6.3774,0.0247,2.3396,3.6771,2.8066,0.0159,0.4744,0.2231,0.0003,5.3165,4.345,3.6984,2.4644,1.868,2.6701,0.1567,0.6081,2.174,0.1579,2.3625,1.403,2.1136,1.075,1.2259,2.6745,7.2021,0.216,1.7945,2.9523,1.8988,1.3979,1.5891,0.0003,4.0532,0.2586,2.1989,0.0632,9.6864,4.3712,3.1577,0.1891,0.7107,2.5478,5.0176,0.0032,3.3762,2.0674,5.1547,0.2025,2.8182,0.8707,3.2806,0.0738,1.8621,6.4219,0.7199,2.2945,0.1066,6.2451,3.0025,2.3156,1.1224,5.3248,0.0045,4.527,1.957,2.3351,4.0754,0.3882,2.7043,2.1993,0.8351,4.2843,2.2984,2.5002,1.0917,3.4086,2.7741,4.783,1.9285,4.1798,5.5098,0.1449,3.5668,2.5716,6.0266,0.0323,0.3626,4.6692,1.3654,2.2341,1.3654,1.6221,3.9567,0.1498,3.0384,5.1394,0.7905,5.0037,1.7449,1.446,3.6205,2.603,1.3151,2.3336,0.3742,3.7622,1.2977,5.5286,0.0767,2.7449,3.4921,0.2109,0.2585,10.5724,6.5073,6.3719,4.3465,0.2166,6.8051,0.163,0.8433]}

{"id":768,"ended":true,"length":252,"text":"Writing Workshop # 27 : Breaking Your Barriers # 1\n\nThe first post is always the most difficult, right? But I suppose that's because the writer is scared, perhaps, of a possible outcome. There are so many possible stories in your head and you're still not sure which one to choose. You can tell so many different kinds of stories. You can be realistic, you can be fantastical, you can make jokes, you can be funny, you can be emotional, you can be sentimental, you can be all of these things. And still you don't know which kind of story to pick. The one in which you get a lot of likes on Facebook. The one in which you get to be at the beach with a cool surfboard.

You only only need to use one die per attack if you roll above your average.\nBut there are average rolls and above average rolls.

For instance, if you roll a 50% chance to hit, that is an average roll, but sometimes you can hit and miss.\nI know.

So the post has gained a lot of views, plus there are two new movies out.\n\nThe Secret Life of Pets\u2013 It\u2019s one of those things I can imagine would only be suitable for kids \u2013 so the target audience here is kids. A group of owners are looking for their pet\u2019s missing. With all those voices it really could be one of those irritating shows, but it\u2019s good to see a movie about pet ownership. It\u2019s quite simple and cute. If you do choose to see it do have small children with you.\n\nWhat to Do in Denver When You\u2019ve Got No Clothes on \u2013 It\u2019s a porn comedy. I\u2019m sure I must be in the minority here when I say I enjoy it without the knowledge it\u2019s just a comedy. The characters do actually make me laugh.

{"id":1553,"ended":true,"length":244,"text":"Everyone has an identical twin somewhere in the world. One in each pair is evil, but it's impossible to know which you are until you meet your twin.\nI've heard this before. The theory doesn't hold a candle to Occams razor, the twin that is evil will always be a twin that was evil in the first place.\nThey can be \"evil\" at times though  for instance sometimes the evil twin is the jealous one    And some are \"evil\" because of abuse, trauma, and abuse.  They aren't evil, they just never know what happened to them etc.\nSure, twins can be bad. But evil twins are an extreme outlier. If the evil twin had the opposite personality and everything else in the world was normal then they would have different personalities. But evil has multiple definitions, but usually involves acting against good moral principles. I guess I should have just said more than one is evil.   You can choose to interpret it in many ways though.\nThat's what all psychopharmacology studies find.  It's that the non identical twins develop a mental illness, or have some trauma that causes them to be \"evil\".

So here we are with the small dino hands....\nYou know what you just described is the plot of Jurassic Park 3 as well.","token_len":265,"entropy":[11.0938,4.0583,3.3097,7.4402,3.6107,4.3855,4.2987,3.2078,7.2166,2.8641,2.6904,5.8898,4.2164,6.2347,5.3588,5.1511,5.0535,2.5786,0.576,0.0035,1.0327,2.1605,5.9074,7.4185,4.8809,3.6647,1.9532,10.7366,2.9092,2.2701,8.6911,3.4901,0.5338,7.0846,2.6697,6.6923,3.7537,3.7204,3.9918,0.9014,0.6988,7.5592,12.3483,1.0536,0.4806,7.393,2.8555,3.7821,4.6854,1.1778,2.9241,5.7361,5.4729,2.4374,6.7236,4.7983,0.6913,1.5942,5.9725,0.408,2.747,0.0337,0.0051,2.4345,1.8119,1.9714,1.2754,3.6326,8.6895,1.4262,3.7958,1.6884,1.5263,3.86,6.2552,4.1084,9.4037,0.0608,1.1829,5.1096,5.1222,1.7105,2.3532,2.541,1.4725,9.3489,9.0605,0.0044,0.6794,3.6911,5.8602,1.2275,3.677,3.8733,1.4215,5.8565,5.2301,3.0206,7.3552,2.9654,6.5621,1.4532,2.0244,0.4266,5.0928,4.796,2.2679,3.3699,4.5854,3.3592,0.8571,2.9687,7.9502,5.1785,0.5187,2.9671,0.9229,0.1674,0.5622,2.3837,0.653,0.0382,2.787,1.2352,3.6166,1.2212,5.6377,3.0769,3.6552,3.515,0.8974,4.3693,14.9939,8.0182,3.5876,5.9086,0.0924,0.9688,1.4108,4.8033,1.4025,1.56,0.4345,9.7933,3.3454,0.9567,4.3015,0.2538,5.5744,4.7749,0.0036,3.9372,0.0532,0.0197,2.9538,0.7471,7.9578,8.0358,1.909,3.0323,3.9206,4.7559,4.3005,1.5522,0.9677,5.4478,5.2954,2.1366,0.0759,0.0205,5.1258,2.6425,3.2565,4.9829,0.608,5.1961,1.6463,0.0094,4.0151,4.6591,2.1486,6.9415,2.9571,4.0657,4.1905,4.8515,0.562,0.4633,2.4501,3.3802,3.8743,2.5897,2.4109,8.0774,2.6963,0.0053,2.1017,0.4291,3.0572,3.9664,6.0444,4.8727,1.8246,0.0047,9.8845,1.4378,4.82,1.2618,1.8259,2.0595,6.3338,2.0563,2.8761,2.3787,1.9595,3.2447,1.6533,0.8158,4.8853,0.518,0.7263,0.0032,1.5809,7.1012,5.4105,4.2815,4.2351,5.6768,0.267,3.4665,1.579,2.6238,4.251,0.2397,0.3994,1.8848,3.6477,6.0463,1.5607,1.0473,1.5368,2.3796,5.0807,4.152,1.8462,0.9925,7.7447,0.856,4.8396,2.374,1.3543,4.453,4.4594,4.9498,4.8723,2.2545,10.4811,0.9666,5.7385,0.2087,4.7902,5.1251,2.2159,0.8149]}

The Happening was based on a \"concept\" I did years ago for an art class; basically the concept was that a mosquito got infected with a parasite, and it would slowly evolve to the point where it no longer wanted to eat, but because it could not fly, it would constantly try to kill itself by jumping out of the air and impaling itself on something.\nWell that was very descriptive and well thought.  Did you have to do anything to turn it into a concept you could project onto a canvas? Did you have to think really hard while making it up? Are you sure you didn't make it up for the assignment?\nYup, totally made it up for that assignment. I tried to go full-on surrealist with it, but then I got tired of drawing lines and circles so I decided to simplify it, add blood, and give the bug a face. I think that it would have been better if I had just gone with the surrealist thing.","token_len":266,"entropy":[8.8169,8.3275,12.8366,2.8039,2.3368,5.5325,0.5558,4.1505,12.6073,5.4594,9.6296,0.2759,1.7281,9.6849,5.481,4.4355,1.9188,4.2258,1.0787,2.9486,5.119,3.4687,3.7219,4.3956,4.0836,7.6311,6.7236,7.287,1.4875,4.2369,3.4538,1.5526,9.1468,3.3668,0.0011,1.6733,2.2174,4.4502,0.2803,5.0206,3.0239,1.7928,3.6424,0.8615,2.2015,9.3647,0.0289,4.2379,2.636,8.8532,0.8709,1.9296,5.3385,6.2449,6.0758,2.8385,0.9543,1.508,7.2772,2.0097,0.6065,8.1579,1.481,5.2441,0.7409,3.7186,6.0929,0.0011,2.0353,4.1242,0.2102,1.0528,5.5584,8.3314,1.4462,2.46,4.674,5.2541,0.323,3.1596,2.9373,4.9442,4.7065,5.7253,6.5086,3.0442,3.2892,1.0257,0.6124,2.1824,3.3553,5.7261,1.9765,0.5886,1.7181,1.9444,1.8101,0.7717,2.4073,2.3194,5.7906,4.6393,2.141,3.0794,0.1561,0.5947,0.3303,5.254,0.0014,3.6959,0.1548,2.1425,3.3966,2.2173,6.0475,0.9046,3.4324,2.0495,5.3364,1.1519,0.9372,0.8835,6.6063,3.2618,0.2212,2.3705,2.0837,3.1826,5.2736,2.2281,0.2122,1.2172,2.2664,1.6351,9.0157,0.293,0.4113,0.5146,4.0248,0.8005,1.3695,5.3001,3.3804,2.0774,4.8895,7.4509,3.087,4.1454,2.098,6.7205,6.2262,13.7743,0.8846,3.0875,2.5774,2.8933,3.228,1.0988,6.7798,1.409,0.9717,0.6412,3.9388,5.8442,2.2259,7.1614,1.0641,1.3849,5.8405,0.7054,4.2606,0.361,1.2592,0.1554,4.297,7.1284,0.1712,8.0119,3.3645,0.9874,4.4086,0.4599,6.1725,0.369,3.9254,1.1468,2.7988,0.0003,2.7612,1.4416,0.6315,4.1766,2.0547,9.5896,0.4919,0.6965,6.2243,0.4936,1.0227,6.7294,7.4583,2.4127,0.0292,0.9173,3.0892,2.0079,0.324,1.9196,5.1794,0.3842,4.4675,6.3045,1.9892,1.4244,6.9162,1.0698,2.1711,0.6714,0.8705,0.8082,3.6573,0.7667,2.8536,3.5754,0.1201,5.1478,6.7776,1.4925,7.3488,5.1434,0.3438,2.4753,0.3832,7.6506,0.6588,3.2843,5.1505,6.5446,1.4056,1.3667,5.1757,2.0027,8.0936,0.9208,4.2518,0.6579,1.9451,3.0022,1.7727,3.4749,3.2236,1.2029,0.5343,2.9652,0.6111,0.8723,0.7989,2.6237,4.2627,1.959,1.5523,6.0156,0.2841,4.2093,0.9825]}

People flock to their voices and they feel important.","token_len":271,"entropy":[3.8828,5.5276,0.2885,0.6749,7.8964,5.7181,3.6435,9.8782,1.0061,1.1385,1.1895,0.2926,1.2746,6.5472,2.0153,2.6591,5.736,0.134,0.2461,0.0222,1.3695,1.3002,8.7084,3.3744,0.0009,1.3053,1.5716,4.4911,0.0021,3.7214,1.0087,1.8537,0.3802,1.1434,1.6619,4.2376,6.3406,0.6743,1.8406,3.1704,0.6402,0.4438,4.8316,3.1046,4.7159,2.4608,1.7875,2.0238,3.8313,6.2641,5.9138,0.1093,2.1535,0.0061,1.1249,0.3872,5.5006,1.9329,3.0612,0.8903,1.0103,2.4727,0.6774,4.4408,3.1469,3.0212,1.2804,4.8865,5.7624,4.7392,5.7072,4.2006,7.555,0.0476,1.868,2.0613,0.0959,1.4153,1.6409,0.3642,1.5479,1.7882,5.1452,3.0677,2.0752,2.6697,5.3412,3.1111,4.7728,6.2199,2.0855,7.7224,2.2342,1.3356,0.6732,0.1526,0.0473,4.3452,5.7339,2.5494,4.0693,2.5195,3.6878,2.476,4.9355,2.1698,7.6907,0.0003,3.3815,2.0844,0.8807,0.2834,4.034,0.9391,3.656,4.0152,3.5111,5.4596,0.7522,3.2431,1.9357,1.2142,4.1931,0.5269,5.3681,1.1302,6.3668,7.1693,1.8015,2.645,2.1061,3.6562,3.4812,2.8544,8.6027,3.3803,5.5619,0.6019,2.7718,4.5174,2.8633,6.7969,5.3587,1.0114,3.1991,0.5968,3.5885,3.5714,7.2407,8.2963,3.8079,5.8498,2.1818,2.2178,3.2992,7.4816,0.0244,3.3675,2.4274,4.2398,0.3264,0.4276,4.9361,1.6066,1.0841,3.2523,1.1113,4.5206,1.2752,0.024,0.812,4.6136,0.1159,2.2162,4.4747,5.7816,1.4223,3.9138,5.6396,1.0417,0.7702,8.4375,12.9612,0.205,10.5071,2.6219,6.3334,5.7679,0.2262,6.0094,2.7398,2.8899,0.4122,3.416,0.4522,3.7984,0.3489,2.7232,4.3856,0.3352,1.0454,2.0734,0.0009,3.7329,2.209,0.077,0.5921,3.7488,0.9123,2.7683,1.3808,1.9124,0.2322,3.6286,0.7425,1.8853,6.4796,0.1925,1.3699,3.066,6.8562,0.3767,2.2857,0.1186,1.351,8.0109,1.2884,1.2999,4.8618,3.7749,1.2088,0.5628,2.7988,5.2656,3.1755,0.5744,4.4217,1.6202,1.7353,0.5821,1.712,1.2458,0.0345,6.8527,7.7796,0.1576,1.9915,2.5689,7.7391,1.6345,1.0531,4.9854,1.3914,1.8875,4.7286,4.4771,7.9366,0.1093,0.4029,1.7068,5.3658,6.4577,0.2421,3.9452,5.3638,1.9497,1.9773,4.7215,7.3473,1.3841]}

{"id":3084,"ended":true,"length":259,"text":"Earth is doomed. When and how it will end is widely known. You decide to spend your final moments in an unusual way.\n\nThe most interesting part of the game is what happens before the actual gameplay. The story and characters are nicely animated, while the setting of the whole adventure is quite unusual, with a very well thought out story. A lot of things happen, sometimes at the same time, with not a lot of intermissions, thus maintaining the speed of the game.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very different, but if you are familiar with other games of similar theme, you won\u2019t experience much of a shock. In fact, even though this is a very different game in terms of gameplay, there is a very clear line to follow.\n\nEvery one of the six stages are played in a different order, with slightly different gameplay and different characters. This makes the game quite replayable, as you are always free to try and do something differently. In that sense, this game is not too difficult or too easy. It is just satisfying enough to maintain a flow, and thus it does not feel like a game that will tire you out.\n\nThere\u2019s also quite a few easter eggs which you may enjoy.

That means you won't be as effective.\nBecause then the enemies won't be as hard to kill. The game has certain boundaries in place for a reason.  If not, people would be running around in Power Armor and slaughtering mobs in 3 hits with their unmodded weapons.\nI always though more dwellers equaled higher defense?\nThe game is programmed in such a way that enemies will drop in power if more than one person is attacking them.

They have different opinions, but they also help each other.  They both try to make each other happy.  What happens?\"  Or something like that.\nWell that's kind of like what it was intended for. The way to read those is usually \"what happens if\/when there was a third person in this relationship\" with the whole \"they *only* have a girlfriend, but they're really in a relationship with two people\".

A series of shows, like CSI, for example, would show on TV the exact same as any other series.\nThat's what I was afraid of\nWell you could use it to answer questions. \"What would you like to be doing right now?\" \"Watching TV\".","token_len":278,"entropy":[11.2935,4.6841,0.0301,3.5686,3.3475,8.8177,0.3866,2.317,5.7621,6.7125,1.6023,4.8592,2.2089,2.2589,7.6991,3.7137,4.2783,6.7485,6.9544,4.9815,0.5948,7.6926,8.9974,6.635,0.4401,0.012,2.207,7.0883,3.9626,0.388,8.3458,0.4692,0.9603,0.4736,2.5919,3.0203,5.6017,9.7401,3.7976,2.1648,0.0489,0.0021,3.4383,0.3781,0.0926,1.9408,1.1643,4.2117,3.993,4.2933,0.2291,7.5635,1.1025,6.6244,3.149,2.6134,1.7083,0.5659,1.2304,5.0607,4.339,0.7611,1.9212,0.1952,0.8191,2.8699,7.0661,1.019,1.3807,4.3991,3.8063,6.7941,5.1286,0.8554,0.0598,1.9305,1.6761,3.0286,2.1682,3.17,1.1003,3.2312,0.6603,1.1201,1.9531,2.0938,1.6087,0.0545,0.0157,0.4078,0.0885,0.0948,4.6892,1.1235,0.2152,8.7318,3.6121,1.2369,1.0875,7.2761,0.6122,7.986,1.3479,6.861,3.8065,5.4857,5.3389,0.0008,3.1556,4.4154,10.2924,0.3173,9.3631,9.3219,0.2904,1.3371,11.2929,2.4895,0.4222,0.8338,4.5727,0.5251,2.7802,2.6637,5.5091,0.1071,6.6215,4.5485,1.8758,0.7555,4.3901,6.2588,8.952,5.3716,0.8591,2.3439,3.025,0.4088,1.6592,0.9562,0.9839,2.0782,4.4113,2.8053,0.2708,5.6272,4.8377,2.5753,0.4129,3.3422,1.1065,4.596,2.3592,2.8067,1.104,1.6019,7.6504,2.4404,3.1395,6.0693,0.0379,0.2423,1.1803,8.2423,0.403,2.9406,0.0827,2.1017,2.4733,3.6491,5.4654,3.6792,5.9565,0.2454,1.6935,4.2991,1.8885,6.4576,3.5015,4.2005,3.5234,1.6264,3.9212,3.479,6.5905,3.2236,3.5917,0.4399,6.922,0.6092,2.175,1.2814,1.5187,1.5172,0.3326,0.0044,1.3452,1.843,8.24,4.0243,1.9109,1.5742,2.3215,2.7045,2.651,5.8039,4.4314,5.4787,3.2118,5.325,0.0014,2.6758,3.4227,3.1015,3.806,0.6756,1.2007,7.7202,0.1266,0.9133,6.2587,4.985,1.1742,4.3016,3.3621,3.4755,5.0628,0.7908,6.5205,0.474,0.3024,2.2398,3.5177,6.1611,3.2404,3.3733,3.716,0.1103,5.7642,3.8931,0.375,1.7426,0.8691,1.5987,4.303,0.9079,3.499,1.9293,3.8679,5.927,0.3912,7.1689,4.5154,4.4502,2.9959,4.3041,4.7938,1.2539,5.3003,3.7342,2.8099,6.0482,1.9702,3.4192,1.112,0.9873,0.3313,4.3467,3.0744,4.0965,0.0123,0.8202,1.4124,8.2843,2.4795,2.5011,5.2471]}

When you finally decide you want kids, you take the test. You pass it, but your partner does not. You have to choose if you want to have an abortion.   I don't think that would happen, but it would make sense.\nIn an ideal world, yes, I'd love that. But it's not going to happen for those of us who are gay, trans or asexual. And it's not like those people would be the ones reproducing anyway.\nThis is one thing that I find odd. Isn't one of the things that makes us all human is our ability to reproduce?  I think the issue of gay\/trans\/asexual people reproducing isn't one of who is going to reproduce. It's what society is going to think of them as a whole.\nSociety isn't gonna care much about gay people or asexuals either way.  If anything, they'd be relieved in that they finally get to stop being the target of attacks every day.

But the gay community will, one day, be\naccepted and loved.\n\nIt is also, if nothing else, an open secret of sorts that both men and women in their prime\nof sexuality are sexually deviant from our society's moral standards. The two are not and perhaps\ncan never be separate issues.

The body appears to have been mutilated in a fashion similar to that of a human serial killer. Footprints and evidence found at the scene suggest this act of violence was committed by a 2nd Sasquatch.\n\nThe murder of a Sasquatch female has shaken the citizens of the town of Woodland, California. It all started while a resident of the town was driving home from the store when their car was surrounded by four large beings which had red eyes and large feet. A witness who came upon the creatures after the incident believes one of the beings said \"This one is mine\" as it stabbed the female creature to death.\n\nThe body of one of the beings has since been recovered from Lake Davis located in Woodland. The remains were transported to the town where they have begun the process of performing a formal autopsy. This will take several days as the body has multiple fractures, a skull fractured into two pieces, and a broken rib.\n\nIt has also been determined that at least 8 witnesses are needed before the body will be released to the public. Once the autopsy is completed the body will be placed on public display so that citizens of the town may mourn its loss.\n\nWe have no further detail on this incident at this time. Keep it tuned to Bigfoot News as we cover this breaking news.","token_len":283,"entropy":[12.4218,0.9856,0.0048,9.6277,3.3382,0.6415,0.9397,6.152,1.5442,0.3691,0.0013,0.6856,7.0956,1.0479,2.1088,1.9991,5.7352,0.1187,0.9842,0.1797,7.1891,0.0032,2.832,1.2538,5.8505,1.1613,0.0087,1.2101,0.6303,0.6454,2.8535,9.117,0.014,0.6804,8.4579,3.7769,2.7681,4.0129,4.6577,2.3698,0.2579,0.6705,1.7218,4.027,8.0014,1.908,2.1415,0.8397,2.4969,0.4632,0.8825,8.1992,1.0287,12.6193,0.0015,0.0028,1.2727,1.0946,0.0112,1.6748,6.2252,0.8655,1.6323,1.8617,0.0007,0.0005,5.5849,2.4239,6.1166,0.7941,9.5568,0.0962,1.8335,3.3638,1.3867,6.1101,1.5336,3.009,2.8502,0.8072,3.4591,6.4373,0.8483,5.266,1.7015,4.5434,1.5242,1.2968,0.599,1.3366,5.5446,1.6807,0.7993,3.1348,4.175,2.0146,6.8743,1.4317,1.4111,6.5039,0.0892,4.7041,4.01,7.8319,4.8935,2.569,7.4751,1.0026,1.0236,3.1515,5.8185,0.2426,3.3168,4.6054,3.1398,4.3477,3.1474,0.221,5.514,4.6411,2.5202,1.3874,6.2189,5.4299,0.2386,0.5134,2.4982,7.1671,1.7989,4.029,3.8022,1.0079,6.2507,2.1845,3.4218,2.5837,8.1935,0.9162,3.7076,6.242,3.147,0.1187,0.4859,1.2592,0.0002,1.4987,3.8837,0.3802,3.3697,0.3739,0.2111,2.7913,2.4517,3.9676,0.1308,1.5267,1.9413,8.0788,6.2063,6.094,0.8783,2.8446,0.0266,1.3594,1.3906,2.8809,2.148,4.9105,0.2287,0.9784,5.7865,4.2531,0.9219,3.2299,7.2449,4.7043,1.2448,0.0393,8.8405,1.2054,6.9309,0.2862,0.3754,4.2375,2.0707,1.7748,2.7087,1.1153,2.8024,0.6718,1.2461,2.1365,8.5125,2.3231,2.1353,3.1548,4.0435,4.4091,3.6977,1.6305,1.6993,1.0739,0.6283,1.5141,3.7722,3.2378,0.6032,0.9822,0.0002,3.9509,1.9478,2.1305,0.1317,2.7426,0.148,4.8196,0.4059,6.2798,5.4851,3.2765,7.4267,5.3189,1.0997,1.6244,2.057,0.0542,3.9029,1.0269,0.3289,0.4128,0.278,5.6252,0.7298,2.6358,0.5902,1.3125,1.6782,1.2801,0.253,0.2394,2.8949,2.6232,3.7479,0.3941,5.6213,0.6972,4.3312,2.4789,1.2845,0.6611,3.3828,6.4767,3.0913,0.3533,0.2973,0.5335,0.0002,4.7747,2.7203,4.0608,2.4662,7.5111,1.4127,1.9831,2.6876,2.6914,0.0335,0.0288,0.4878,6.8302,3.9845,5.531,1.2168,8.4711,2.8508,2.1774,0.9022,6.4807,1.8836,6.3571,0.3324,1.4187]}

There is so much wit here, especially in Mazursky\u2019s own dialogue, that it would be impossible to give everything justice in a brief review, but it would be wrong to ignore one of this year\u2019s most promising titles in terms of quality. \u201cThe Way We Get By\u201d is a must for anyone who appreciates a good comedy\/drama that gets both of those genres just right.\u201d","token_len":284,"entropy":[10.4688,9.4515,8.5973,2.6364,1.5239,0.01,0.553,4.703,9.2773,4.651,2.1621,5.7637,4.7499,9.6888,0.3392,3.0928,5.1829,8.7336,3.3606,9.409,4.7483,6.3445,4.7955,17.1373,9.3578,1.5327,3.9768,4.3224,11.4181,0.0241,1.4743,1.5889,0.0039,7.4789,1.5856,1.6555,0.7851,0.0003,4.1361,6.8231,5.9217,5.3213,2.2898,0.8168,0.8427,3.8388,0.2932,0.3205,4.7769,5.3321,5.638,10.7511,1.4699,3.6672,6.3966,1.9665,5.7589,4.0154,1.252,8.4233,8.6668,0.2771,1.6902,6.5879,0.416,4.7159,1.8575,5.5997,5.0374,6.7121,0.8277,1.4221,1.5119,0.2247,1.5126,5.2222,1.6946,0.3403,3.109,5.4933,4.4206,4.171,0.812,4.75,0.9111,0.9713,3.6935,3.6382,8.2719,2.5928,2.566,1.9457,1.9869,2.6543,3.7056,3.9662,1.7992,5.0792,5.712,0.0271,0.5281,2.9914,0.2111,3.1293,3.6488,6.5902,0.6398,4.5377,5.2508,0.1353,3.4542,3.859,1.1896,1.7842,6.2256,0.0173,6.4492,0.3627,0.8244,5.1616,0.0164,7.3655,9.059,2.1137,2.4751,0.6279,0.2368,1.9093,4.0969,1.8867,6.739,2.8127,0.0004,1.4727,1.2038,3.9313,3.6061,0.946,1.1616,4.3224,1.7652,1.4575,1.751,5.2842,3.8487,0.6444,7.3246,2.3717,4.3058,5.066,2.141,6.8302,2.0103,1.8803,2.2688,5.9877,0.0251,2.6776,1.1322,2.5677,3.7103,5.0448,5.1918,0.9404,0.9698,0.2894,0.668,5.4225,3.4253,1.0422,3.02,0.0011,2.9391,1.6594,3.9748,0.1155,4.4919,2.9531,4.6486,2.0856,5.5938,3.4345,3.9438,5.6162,4.8234,1.9437,4.6867,6.4367,1.2079,2.3852,1.2804,1.8916,4.1407,1.1073,1.091,4.2467,1.1355,3.3511,0.0304,6.1988,3.6241,1.4937,3.9937,1.5216,8.0203,0.062,0.0378,0.1131,0.0728,0.042,5.4091,6.3687,1.1026,0.8782,1.0368,5.5491,0.7307,3.7213,0.6907,4.6466,6.2418,8.6297,3.2238,2.4257,8.1371,1.5512,2.1528,0.3963,1.6981,5.3706,0.8198,5.3803,0.2912,2.9892,5.2636,0.4519,4.8776,2.5886,6.0236,0.5438,0.1046,1.5894,5.7101,5.9147,3.4042,3.56,0.0015,4.0686,0.9836,3.6288,0.5212,2.1646,0.911,0.0079,0.0075,0.0667,0.4404,0.0715,0.6617,1.2096,3.8465,3.1419,1.3279,0.7622,3.9584,0.0018,2.6007,2.3181,1.4429,5.343,2.0956,0.0144,2.7782,4.8959,6.3747,4.4997,1.3489,5.079,6.6605,0.063,0.4386,1.6009,2.0275]}

This is also a question, if i am able to answer it, it would be the biggest achievement of my writing. For me writing is a way of understanding my life. It is a combination of the two worlds, the spiritual world as well as the mundane world. It is not about one of the worlds but about making them inter dependant. For me writing is an experience, i try to express that experience as fully as possible because only then one can have understanding to all those experiences.\n\nYour Answer\n\nPlease Note : This discussion is purely based on your individual understanding.

{"id":43,"ended":true,"length":269,"text":"First contact with an alien race. As part of the first meeting, the aliens share a truth with us that is devastatingly terrifying. However upon reflection, a lot of things now make perfect sense.\n\nThe aliens are here to destroy us. Not sure a much worse way to find somebody.\n\nIt was a good while before we found an explanation. The aliens, once they made their existence known to humanity, did their best to destroy us. We had lost the space race against the Vulcans, thus our fate was sealed.\n\nThis would make sense. They would have little interest if they were planning to rebuild once we had all died. On the other hand, if only a small number of us had survived, this could have made little difference in their plans.\n\nThe only way to save humanity would have been for the Vulcans to take over as a united race. The problem with this is that they themselves were probably wiped out by the Borg in the first contact, if they had any survivors. At this point, our only allies were the Klingons. They would also have been destroyed by the Borg.\n\nThe only other possibility was a group of humanoids that evolved some means to survive in space. At this point the human race could only survive as part of a united group, or the aliens could have taken what remained of us to make our home on their ships.","token_len":286,"entropy":[9.3545,1.1719,3.8337,3.9869,4.8339,3.06,5.4563,4.1115,0.0017,1.2261,5.4098,4.9337,0.6713,1.9262,3.185,5.7622,1.4111,10.0042,5.1948,2.893,1.9703,2.0451,7.8766,2.5045,5.0786,0.8431,5.2729,9.5043,4.8322,0.3009,4.6772,4.3913,0.1468,4.1521,7.0438,4.6798,5.4368,0.0019,1.1928,1.5094,0.0401,2.2046,3.1277,1.5986,5.6136,0.8804,4.1313,1.6034,0.8157,5.2285,7.4334,7.2366,6.061,6.2238,2.0278,0.3635,5.9313,8.8834,2.3901,1.3907,0.0002,3.892,3.2343,1.8879,3.4266,7.9435,2.5625,1.2102,2.965,3.9759,3.642,1.6466,2.8361,1.6278,4.5722,4.6793,1.9275,5.4876,2.3139,7.2408,0.4973,2.0301,3.3283,0.1302,4.5702,3.4241,0.478,0.0977,2.7445,0.9646,0.4692,2.918,3.0506,5.0057,2.666,7.1217,1.8574,6.8828,1.1604,7.3287,0.0058,0.0001,0.9445,7.4109,3.3293,4.9755,0.9163,1.2758,0.6933,1.8093,0.0002,3.8598,5.0103,4.2445,1.4213,1.5197,3.175,2.286,1.4807,7.9303,3.8382,5.991,1.7136,1.7446,6.5095,0.8354,6.0915,6.4624,1.8602,2.5548,4.9062,2.8038,0.5048,6.296,0.5973,0.2376,0.0135,0.08,2.0051,6.6624,4.0346,2.6366,2.4576,0.124,2.6841,1.688,1.0233,0.7455,4.1227,2.8271,0.8429,3.3447,5.1464,0.4102,3.5165,2.7254,1.9733,0.1908,0.9629,0.0002,2.5088,4.0198,1.8391,0.6684,2.8477,2.04,2.0075,1.7399,0.255,2.8247,1.5647,1.0996,0.003,0.0001,0.0853,3.641,1.4112,4.8098,2.2058,6.8502,2.9822,0.5856,2.5888,5.2807,1.956,1.1658,1.6064,0.2774,1.774,6.3373,2.5053,5.3359,5.522,0.0378,1.3557,0.6771,4.5591,2.7408,0.9482,0.9536,7.5588,1.9905,6.0179,2.0891,0.9686,4.412,4.7323,0.4451,5.6461,1.7326,0.155,0.4429,4.4263,2.1898,6.9624,1.5082,0.6187,3.8987,0.0006,1.2503,3.1376,1.9723,4.947,0.8729,1.5823,3.5254,1.2078,0.5548,1.6739,1.5999,0.6731,0.0002,2.0988,2.9126,2.8898,3.7333,1.5068,3.129,5.0791,0.1505,4.3149,1.2448,2.2249,7.5901,5.4034,7.6213,1.2754,2.3195,2.392,2.1002,0.4668,5.226,0.5201,0.1208,3.5056,5.0792,5.3375,2.8879,2.126,1.4151,3.1048,3.9288,0.0044,0.8286,3.4774,2.9203,2.0282,3.7734,3.4935,4.1773,1.666,1.4845,3.0753,7.2535,3.3082,0.3049,2.0178,3.1435,4.2531,3.8802,3.1233,2.2783,4.2121,4.9351,0.2353]}

{"id":4926,"ended":true,"length":269,"text":"First contact with an alien race. As part of the first meeting, the aliens share a truth with us that is devastatingly terrifying. However upon reflection, a lot of things now make perfect sense.\n\nThe aliens are here to destroy us. Not sure a much worse way to find somebody.\n\nIt was a good while before we found an explanation. The aliens, once they made their existence known to humanity, did their best to destroy us. We had lost the space race against the Vulcans, thus our fate was sealed.\n\nThis would make sense. They would have little interest if they were planning to rebuild once we had all died. On the other hand, if only a small number of us had survived, this could have made little difference in their plans.\n\nThe only way to save humanity would have been for the Vulcans to take over as a united race. The problem with this is that they themselves were probably wiped out by the Borg in the first contact, if they had any survivors. At this point, our only allies were the Klingons. They would also have been destroyed by the Borg.\n\nThe only other possibility was a group of humanoids that evolved some means to survive in space. At this point the human race could only survive as part of a united group, or the aliens could have taken what remained of us to make our home on their ships.","token_len":286,"entropy":[9.3545,1.1719,3.8337,3.9869,4.8339,3.06,5.4563,4.1115,0.0017,1.2261,5.4098,4.9337,0.6713,1.9262,3.185,5.7622,1.4111,10.0042,5.1948,2.893,1.9703,2.0451,7.8766,2.5045,5.0786,0.8431,5.2729,9.5043,4.8322,0.3009,4.6772,4.3913,0.1468,4.1521,7.0438,4.6798,5.4368,0.0019,1.1928,1.5094,0.0401,2.2046,3.1277,1.5986,5.6136,0.8804,4.1313,1.6034,0.8157,5.2285,7.4334,7.2366,6.061,6.2238,2.0278,0.3635,5.9313,8.8834,2.3901,1.3907,0.0002,3.892,3.2343,1.8879,3.4266,7.9435,2.5625,1.2102,2.965,3.9759,3.642,1.6466,2.8361,1.6278,4.5722,4.6793,1.9275,5.4876,2.3139,7.2408,0.4973,2.0301,3.3283,0.1302,4.5702,3.4241,0.478,0.0977,2.7445,0.9646,0.4692,2.918,3.0506,5.0057,2.666,7.1217,1.8574,6.8828,1.1604,7.3287,0.0058,0.0001,0.9445,7.4109,3.3293,4.9755,0.9163,1.2758,0.6933,1.8093,0.0002,3.8598,5.0103,4.2445,1.4213,1.5197,3.175,2.286,1.4807,7.9303,3.8382,5.991,1.7136,1.7446,6.5095,0.8354,6.0915,6.4624,1.8602,2.5548,4.9062,2.8038,0.5048,6.296,0.5973,0.2376,0.0135,0.08,2.0051,6.6624,4.0346,2.6366,2.4576,0.124,2.6841,1.688,1.0233,0.7455,4.1227,2.8271,0.8429,3.3447,5.1464,0.4102,3.5165,2.7254,1.9733,0.1908,0.9629,0.0002,2.5088,4.0198,1.8391,0.6684,2.8477,2.04,2.0075,1.7399,0.255,2.8247,1.5647,1.0996,0.003,0.0001,0.0853,3.641,1.4112,4.8098,2.2058,6.8502,2.9822,0.5856,2.5888,5.2807,1.956,1.1658,1.6064,0.2774,1.774,6.3373,2.5053,5.3359,5.522,0.0378,1.3557,0.6771,4.5591,2.7408,0.9482,0.9536,7.5588,1.9905,6.0179,2.0891,0.9686,4.412,4.7323,0.4451,5.6461,1.7326,0.155,0.4429,4.4263,2.1898,6.9624,1.5082,0.6187,3.8987,0.0006,1.2503,3.1376,1.9723,4.947,0.8729,1.5823,3.5254,1.2078,0.5548,1.6739,1.5999,0.6731,0.0002,2.0988,2.9126,2.8898,3.7333,1.5068,3.129,5.0791,0.1505,4.3149,1.2448,2.2249,7.5901,5.4034,7.6213,1.2754,2.3195,2.392,2.1002,0.4668,5.226,0.5201,0.1208,3.5056,5.0792,5.3375,2.8879,2.126,1.4151,3.1048,3.9288,0.0044,0.8286,3.4774,2.9203,2.0282,3.7734,3.4935,4.1773,1.666,1.4845,3.0753,7.2535,3.3082,0.3049,2.0178,3.1435,4.2531,3.8802,3.1233,2.2783,4.2121,4.9351,0.2353]}

It is said that the president used time and travel to ban assault rifles and gun violence. \"\n\nHere is an exchange between Benjamin Franklin and George Washington on the use of assault rifles:\n\nFranklin: \"How will you get to Boston to fight the British if you can't move fast and shoot at a hundred bullets every minute?\" Washington: \"We'll use horses.\" Franklin: \"I bet you'll go riding too, and that is very dangerous.\" Washington: \"No, we'll all wear these cool looking uniforms.\" Franklin: \"It will look really cool.\" Washington: \"I'll look good in mine.\" Franklin: \"Hmmmm, cool uniforms.\"\n\nThe History Channel goes on to cite Benjamin Franklin as one of the founding fathers, while also quoting George Washington as well.","token_len":287,"entropy":[11.1322,0.3373,8.6009,4.7552,2.2283,1.9735,1.5739,0.0178,10.7096,14.2001,12.8699,8.0501,2.9135,2.9799,1.8289,4.3697,2.9767,2.2409,0.9108,0.7494,1.4772,0.0033,2.445,0.7634,5.4981,8.8218,0.9615,4.9692,0.4387,3.0695,2.3862,0.2247,10.477,4.7556,7.5895,2.793,0.4817,0.0146,0.644,6.8299,5.995,4.7172,1.6863,5.5157,0.1377,3.3566,0.3302,0.7983,1.822,0.0006,2.0193,5.7752,16.309,2.7783,7.98,2.517,3.9597,4.7294,0.7108,1.4583,3.9941,3.6622,8.9769,1.7779,3.3267,2.8587,5.9319,1.512,5.8232,0.3974,0.3923,4.139,3.4295,4.4736,2.8103,2.1759,0.512,3.1646,2.812,3.8402,0.0898,5.1223,1.022,1.8282,3.0648,6.7506,0.7013,0.5728,5.9772,0.5062,0.9246,1.0365,4.5659,2.3808,2.5043,1.6073,0.4477,0.0037,5.0104,0.0153,1.6312,2.5062,3.3806,0.7225,5.9833,4.1244,3.0219,2.9929,1.9651,2.5716,1.5717,1.7609,6.9034,3.7257,4.529,5.4677,0.5135,4.0406,1.4872,9.2026,0.7596,5.5144,0.404,1.3854,3.185,1.9954,3.2269,0.2024,1.6701,1.7527,4.441,2.2062,6.1218,4.2872,0.3982,6.5609,5.6541,0.162,1.6993,3.6582,0.1091,1.5579,4.97,0.6998,0.0002,5.5036,1.376,2.6068,6.1834,0.9106,7.2601,1.4909,0.5506,3.9517,0.07,2.8265,0.7549,5.6926,0.046,7.6325,0.1363,2.5169,0.1694,0.0001,3.1003,0.003,0.2599,1.8284,4.2479,4.6974,1.0215,4.1892,3.2084,6.4093,3.7605,4.9735,1.7727,4.4237,4.783,0.5688,2.1169,0.4398,6.6564,4.7646,2.6683,3.0067,1.7303,2.9395,5.2151,3.4853,4.9307,1.3008,0.9163,0.689,0.0126,0.0499,3.3141,2.4318,4.42,8.0981,2.8363,2.2142,0.1456,0.0342,2.4443,5.728,1.0551,1.8543,3.7953,7.4618,6.5199,2.2807,2.7436,3.901,3.8152,5.1965,2.2085,0.8789,2.3909,0.0455,0.0384,3.8986,0.7073,2.2985,0.8176,5.9593,5.4143,5.6241,8.146,6.0965,4.3017,1.7297,1.652,0.0926,0.03,3.9574,1.7877,4.6682,4.2848,1.1738,1.7453,2.3586,0.0361,0.0358,2.3004,2.3035,5.0287,2.7241,1.9518,7.3437,0.7945,1.6129,0.0794,0.0375,5.5751,4.8095,1.711,4.8905,3.7996,1.4014,0.9,0.0003,2.0259,4.5495,6.4401,6.579,0.384,0.083,5.6128,5.2544,0.0167,1.8269,2.6404,0.1331,0.328,2.0451,0.0268,2.2343,4.6088,2.5872,3.9073,2.8687,0.0226,1.612,6.0923,1.0388]}

But it also won \"Best Documentary Feature\" for \"The Hospital,\" the opening night film at the Venice Film Festival.\nIn \"The Godfather\" (2), Francis Ford Coppola's epic tale of the gangster and the warlord, there is one scene that stands out as unforgettable. It is a moment of extreme violence, but it happens after that initial moment of violence has begun: Once Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has agreed to make a move on rival Fredo Corleone (Paul Sorvino), Michael's brother Fredo has to be knocked unconscious in order for the plot to proceed.\nAlthough most scenes in both films were directed by Mr. Coppola, the camera operator on \"The Godfather\" was Jean Doumanian, a veteran cinematographer of French and American exploitation flicks in the fifties and the early sixties who had moved to Venice. Mr. Doumanian, who was 89 and suffering from Parkinson's disease, had been with Mr. Coppola for a couple of years at that point; he was known as being a perfectionist whose meticulous attention to detail would set him apart from other cinematographers of the time.","token_len":287,"entropy":[10.2818,10.675,4.3723,5.7391,2.6652,5.6838,0.0123,2.6991,3.2,5.8071,4.8253,4.6452,2.2174,5.7743,1.7456,9.714,5.6763,0.2902,5.6902,0.7578,0.1137,0.0001,0.2252,5.0758,1.1268,2.5333,4.0334,4.7542,0.0011,3.2277,7.5871,0.0487,0.4394,3.1831,1.1682,1.8226,0.6022,0.7737,0.8377,2.9569,2.4211,3.1742,1.691,4.9683,0.9952,4.1274,0.0014,3.5479,0.9174,0.8587,2.6013,1.153,10.1135,2.8081,2.3038,5.9006,3.1068,3.81,4.9945,0.5647,3.3789,0.1228,0.0364,0.5214,1.4063,2.3683,3.9632,0.3077,0.4481,0.0002,2.1978,3.2747,7.9132,2.3938,5.8936,0.9745,0.0008,0.0002,0.0001,2.6819,7.4827,3.025,0.1575,2.5294,7.0256,1.4202,3.5435,2.2047,6.0888,1.3529,1.8044,5.5623,1.4145,3.9192,2.838,1.5996,3.425,0.0395,1.9364,6.17,0.8569,1.9125,1.6153,1.796,3.4638,1.9955,6.0539,1.7202,1.4411,3.6092,1.6614,5.7772,4.3878,4.5754,7.4241,3.4765,1.0146,3.431,3.0937,4.3505,3.3291,7.0401,6.9503,6.1521,0.0257,0.0025,3.0367,6.1966,0.2203,0.0,0.2854,2.2157,7.1959,0.0616,4.8875,0.8488,5.2389,1.0215,9.2443,6.4532,4.5924,5.4483,0.1232,0.0098,0.1361,4.4685,8.2661,1.5548,0.0009,0.4317,4.0504,2.7068,3.6425,5.7801,0.267,2.9128,3.4521,4.0229,6.0974,1.7136,2.8539,1.776,3.5651,1.9601,6.4522,0.0766,2.7346,0.3483,1.4388,5.7509,4.9859,4.8527,1.6527,6.583,0.5908,1.4721,4.2633,0.0928,6.0712,0.0124,1.6054,0.0023,0.0009,0.5233,1.6776,5.7997,3.9013,3.4099,1.1357,0.036,1.0107,0.0004,0.0605,1.84,6.9309,7.4265,4.8316,7.4929,0.9353,1.6793,4.1426,2.2128,0.0029,0.0016,4.1483,5.8558,1.8791,1.9972,8.0165,7.3711,0.0147,4.7928,0.1555,7.4245,0.2119,0.0001,0.773,6.4892,2.2345,0.4264,0.0,2.678,1.8137,5.43,0.4885,3.1241,2.4644,3.6793,0.0004,0.5675,0.002,0.0017,2.4016,0.6278,1.8944,10.2175,3.9997,7.2398,0.0862,2.8454,0.0281,0.3147,0.5473,1.6686,1.6805,5.1299,2.7384,0.0005,0.4755,0.0007,0.0004,1.2431,2.815,3.2076,0.0467,0.2152,2.4223,3.3734,1.8606,4.6355,1.1463,1.6894,4.7612,1.5524,6.7297,1.2534,5.5923,0.0077,5.4472,5.0936,2.8234,0.0897,0.1145,2.8761,4.9894,0.5698,0.0512,0.227,2.2223,3.5439,0.0056,0.0203,3.3838,0.8871,0.364,0.2523]}

{"id":2935,"ended":true,"length":278,"text":"`` Here, take this sword. You're going to need it when they bring out the tanks. ''\n\n-- Gen. George Patton, April 23, 1944\n\nThe story of the sword Patton handed off to an SS officer is a poignant one, and perhaps the epitome of the ``brave soldier'' attitude of Germans toward the war. It also underscores the fundamental difference between America's military leaders during World War II and those of today: the former placed ultimate value on saving lives and the latter, on winning and protecting war-fighting capabilities. That means that when we face a crisis today, our soldiers and airmen should expect leaders with the same sense of urgency and determination and perhaps a more realistic grasp on military capabilities to turn to. Our armed forces must be able to turn to a ``good war,'' with the military leaders and soldiers themselves committed to that goal, knowing that in many cases the enemy is unlikely to fight in a way that is actually conducive to our own victory.\n\nThe story also underscores how critical it was for Americans to maintain a sense of national unity during World War II, which, as I wrote recently in the Financial Times, was the key factor in defeating Hitler. That sense of national unity is exactly the one that Americans must have as well today. Our forces cannot be deployed to ``good wars,'' or at least not the kinds of wars that bring about major casualties on a regular basis.","token_len":288,"entropy":[8.852,2.8019,5.3996,3.3303,8.3045,2.2606,3.2818,2.7241,1.5713,0.0516,2.3233,0.5447,3.7617,4.6804,4.6408,3.9524,0.9086,8.0943,0.7115,8.2372,2.7664,0.0199,4.9405,8.351,1.7409,6.205,2.9061,1.3603,4.1999,3.6885,0.0973,1.2956,1.1901,0.0003,2.8733,6.31,0.8544,0.9792,6.9117,12.8423,7.9399,5.0542,0.2284,4.8359,5.8937,1.064,2.61,2.2757,5.6414,0.7319,1.4677,2.0644,4.0307,1.4246,6.8829,0.0271,0.0123,1.5996,11.3298,5.8808,2.5257,2.6534,0.4347,6.17,1.9158,8.2021,5.0861,1.176,3.605,0.6343,2.8776,3.7697,4.5944,0.4753,5.616,2.6571,0.0992,5.582,0.6993,2.7126,3.7687,6.9417,0.9405,0.0006,0.0387,0.1572,1.1325,0.9917,2.0199,1.8148,2.3355,4.2209,6.7524,7.8511,4.6093,0.2498,5.2957,0.2825,1.4441,1.8414,0.0146,2.6182,2.0034,4.8835,3.1295,3.6942,6.0397,2.7152,4.4313,4.9094,0.399,4.9405,5.6206,1.5548,3.672,4.1745,4.8358,1.6957,4.3783,6.0434,0.4501,2.9711,3.5522,2.3796,5.3288,0.123,2.774,4.2896,6.8735,2.8823,2.132,2.4691,3.9667,0.0239,2.6391,1.045,2.6593,3.397,7.4562,3.0287,2.1664,4.1988,3.7541,1.4794,4.0609,5.4811,2.5839,6.0967,1.1421,9.3564,5.8328,5.9438,0.0389,2.942,1.6166,2.9603,0.0772,5.9178,1.0008,3.3675,6.8538,3.5776,4.0678,2.5111,4.4408,1.601,3.9487,3.2933,2.9796,5.306,5.1411,4.7697,0.0486,3.1174,1.5251,1.9613,5.0303,0.7515,4.3218,4.3097,0.844,2.0541,4.3986,1.5579,4.8304,0.027,5.3073,4.2108,1.6437,2.8188,0.3674,2.4664,5.1593,5.0631,0.0263,3.8944,3.1205,3.7992,0.1948,1.0616,0.0002,2.0716,4.2539,3.9948,2.5941,2.6141,4.4234,1.9214,2.8849,0.6217,3.5977,0.4383,4.716,1.6715,2.4708,0.0324,3.6057,1.7997,1.9842,1.8081,0.001,0.0103,1.3547,3.3296,3.1136,2.1239,4.1564,2.6777,4.7957,1.8688,2.0794,6.4622,0.0247,0.16,1.5183,2.0239,2.3611,2.8305,0.8172,4.3123,1.619,1.0367,3.4718,2.5261,0.4715,1.58,0.0776,2.4469,5.7579,2.9841,4.5639,0.7574,4.527,2.662,2.6347,3.4555,4.2663,2.9647,1.1373,4.5557,4.9415,4.372,1.8378,5.8648,1.855,8.0662,5.674,3.2968,0.9152,3.7022,3.1455,0.271,1.2851,4.749,3.3221,0.1548,2.3312,0.4573,7.1389,1.5353,4.7371,3.2356,3.5381,1.8926,2.7113,0.0241,0.3917]}

{"id":3273,"ended":true,"length":268,"text":"A Tree Stands...\n\nThe book is intended as a guide to help farmers grow a tree crop on their farm, and offers insight, knowledge and practical advice throughout. This section explores the background, the benefits and possible issues of growing trees on a UK rural farm.\n\nOne of the key benefits of a tree crop lies in the increased demand for biomass, which can power everything from boilers to generating electrical supply to your home, and help you save money on your electricity bill. You can learn more about the environmental benefits of growing trees by browsing our resource pages.\n\nTrees also offer many environmental benefits in addition to biomass. These include stabilisation of the land; increasing ground cover; providing a cool environment for wildlife and reducing the risk of flooding.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that trees are not always practical for your farm. For smallholder arable farms, trees are more likely to create a conflict with crops and livestock that should be the main consideration. Trees can also create problems for machinery used for harvesting hay and straw, or even hay and silage, particularly in spring and summer. Trees planted on your fields can also damage equipment that you wish to use in the future. A tree crop would also mean more mowing or baling, although this can be minimised by using machinery that can pass through trees and by mowing earlier in the season when the tree growth spurt is over.","token_len":289,"entropy":[11.0245,6.0844,4.2491,7.2215,1.2967,0.019,2.554,6.9541,1.9476,5.8639,2.269,0.3083,2.9702,0.8438,5.4745,7.8639,3.8656,3.789,2.5869,6.9939,3.8677,1.0619,3.1109,1.8035,1.9921,5.9245,5.6995,5.0342,4.6582,0.7935,3.2497,0.7435,6.7256,0.9396,3.5667,4.7927,5.0951,1.0724,8.3328,1.7993,3.0746,5.021,0.9088,5.5378,4.1373,1.8446,1.6375,2.2873,1.7086,1.7925,8.3716,6.564,0.8497,1.0137,0.9071,0.0003,6.0322,0.5788,0.1771,3.2266,2.602,0.1916,2.9595,1.048,1.9564,6.3877,0.0863,0.9778,4.9995,6.0715,0.477,6.7275,1.6483,1.2535,2.0672,6.8039,6.3973,0.0407,7.955,0.1006,0.3867,7.9374,5.163,6.3004,2.2082,6.5784,1.8363,3.4547,2.4765,5.6164,2.1495,3.6353,0.8025,1.1782,2.8612,1.2637,1.2647,0.2144,4.9195,0.7556,3.4048,0.4472,0.1802,1.4521,6.6429,0.7891,0.1604,2.0856,0.242,3.6224,5.0247,2.7375,5.4276,2.119,0.5881,0.2937,0.0003,5.3395,0.151,4.3548,2.6961,2.6312,4.4898,0.0988,3.7206,3.2304,0.0139,6.718,0.8637,3.6174,0.1176,8.628,3.9223,0.3164,2.1785,4.6032,5.5064,3.8285,6.4109,0.4219,1.0541,4.2955,2.3081,7.1939,2.1066,0.609,2.8411,1.5128,4.2016,1.7432,1.6717,0.0407,2.9343,1.8264,0.9646,0.0002,4.7517,18.2727,7.4855,0.7884,1.5326,0.2646,2.0057,0.1903,1.8474,1.0281,1.184,4.5634,6.2411,2.9783,3.3625,2.4847,0.8443,3.2403,7.1837,5.9416,8.1995,0.8145,2.4617,0.5187,2.5507,1.3399,2.6665,1.9042,0.0525,6.0804,2.8275,6.2766,1.7295,5.6567,1.9201,3.5638,3.2708,6.2,0.4599,7.4317,2.7851,5.1823,1.0234,2.6221,1.6622,0.5854,3.5916,2.2106,0.4084,8.3248,5.7107,1.6666,2.9027,6.4661,1.5875,6.2273,1.4399,2.4764,4.7851,6.4453,2.9308,6.9463,0.3233,2.4368,5.5169,1.3663,7.0381,1.0266,0.7985,0.4745,2.2569,8.366,1.4678,3.6778,4.5527,1.7055,0.7236,4.4854,5.2938,2.1362,3.8002,7.5557,0.0512,1.0951,2.9982,1.0528,3.0534,0.4247,5.0598,1.5565,2.1375,5.3475,1.4362,4.0796,3.6702,7.5436,0.5099,3.4033,11.1264,2.6681,1.7566,6.5947,1.5221,2.5054,0.6456,6.1755,0.0188,0.7707,2.3486,6.7507,1.3331,2.5567,7.9677,1.3416,1.6641,2.4255,6.8276,7.2584,0.1116,9.0779,1.6477,0.0618,0.9652,3.4769,1.7309,3.7659,4.9331,7.1608,0.483,0.9939,5.7238,0.1681]}
{"id":819,"ended":true,"length":267,"text":"It is revealed that butterflies do not exist, and instead children in third world countries have been painting moths and releasing them in the sky, in a new documentary commissioned by the BBC.\n\nCaught up, the film shows the process, and is a poignant look at how children are being conditioned to ignore the reality of the natural world, and conform to the demands of the industrial world.\n\nIn a press release, Executive Director of the BBC, Paul Marquis said:\n\nThis documentary is the answer to complaints from the children of the poor, who are being indoctrinated into believing that butterflies simply don\u2019t exist. To tell them otherwise is to rob them of the joy of innocence.\n\nThe press release also points to the BBC\u2019s commitment to giving out factual stories to kids about science, space, ecology, and wildlife.\n\nOf course, this seems to be nothing but the BBC trying to control our minds in service to corporate hegemony, which would have been more than enough. But also note how the BBC has managed to give this a positive spin by adding a bit of childlike wonder, like, \u201cThis is where butterflies live\u201d, which could almost be construed as a noble cause.\n\nNotably, the BBC will not release the full name of the documentary, because it is not something that you take your kids to.

This is a memoir, and is intended to be written anonymously to help protect the family.\n\nIt covers things such as:\n\nHow we learned to live with the fact that a Catholic priest molested us.\n\nThe guilt and shame.\n\nThe relationship between the Catholic Church and pedophile priests.\n\nThe impact on the victim after confessing the crime to the pastor.\n\nThe impact on the victim after telling his family.\n\nThe impact on the victim after trying to reconcile both forgiveness and justice.\n\nThe impact on the victim after years of pain and suffering.\n\nThe difficulty of talking about what happened.\n\nThe guilt and shame and regret that we caused.\n\nThe guilt and shame and regret that our parishioners felt.\n\nThe impact on the priest and his family.\n\nIt also discusses the Catholic Church\u2019s failure to take action against the priest, and the impact that this has on both the priest and his family.","token_len":290,"entropy":[11.0509,2.9706,1.958,7.0742,17.3715,2.5903,5.7638,2.9119,5.1906,0.0158,1.1247,2.7284,1.394,12.4678,0.6927,3.733,12.7109,3.7587,1.3381,0.0059,2.6777,4.5976,1.8903,5.2738,2.0059,0.3625,5.6693,0.8983,0.6446,2.9778,2.3213,1.9234,4.0713,0.8043,1.9817,0.5061,0.4755,0.0513,1.2729,4.2287,2.1384,1.8481,2.9056,1.7674,6.6065,2.0422,0.5903,4.1985,0.0004,0.6436,0.6294,3.7777,2.0534,0.172,1.1281,0.218,1.4863,4.3295,5.4766,0.276,1.3318,1.6066,2.3077,2.4398,4.386,5.8152,0.2139,5.1461,3.7673,3.9882,2.2714,3.2112,5.3151,0.2874,0.3151,4.2352,2.3825,0.3071,4.8136,0.5029,7.0269,2.3593,1.5027,1.0287,0.3725,0.7333,3.4144,1.5065,1.4,5.3801,1.5979,1.7585,3.5428,2.2159,0.8,1.0882,4.7368,6.3004,3.8174,2.9393,4.5764,1.0193,2.4051,1.3007,1.1051,0.0002,4.0236,5.8869,6.9814,2.383,0.0012,3.2324,0.34,0.0001,2.6939,5.4007,2.9973,1.6631,4.0977,0.3562,2.2102,4.1275,0.0496,3.6038,2.8231,0.1712,2.22,0.0026,5.7031,2.0235,0.2803,0.0001,1.9285,7.1164,2.1624,1.5033,6.1622,0.1424,0.0002,1.2338,5.2933,0.3525,1.2472,2.698,1.1923,0.0857,3.0071,1.9205,0.1944,0.3006,0.0506,0.0001,1.1201,4.7021,2.1871,1.2402,3.9241,6.3244,6.0899,0.0028,2.4751,0.8186,3.9507,0.8822,6.2829,0.6424,0.0531,0.0001,1.0254,3.3222,0.3718,0.4048,1.3941,0.5556,4.5018,2.2469,2.4618,1.3897,0.0498,0.0001,0.9133,1.7451,0.1449,0.2865,0.6669,0.1488,5.9053,0.1209,4.6397,7.561,7.8753,0.0577,6.7521,0.4381,0.0626,0.0001,0.8508,1.239,0.1038,0.1744,0.362,0.121,6.8722,0.101,5.8354,0.7565,1.5294,0.332,0.0698,0.0001,0.7289,7.5746,0.6451,6.0339,0.8328,3.2318,0.474,1.888,0.1089,0.0001,0.5854,5.4023,0.7287,0.0853,3.4502,5.5359,2.1804,3.7779,5.8963,0.845,0.0554,0.0001,0.6107,3.9917,0.1234,0.1814,0.9885,0.7728,0.3061,3.1054,6.8569,0.9386,0.0251,2.4009,1.4538,0.0541,0.0001,0.3647,2.4607,0.2845,0.2438,4.7222,2.2313,1.4101,0.2775,0.5983,0.0569,0.0001,5.0226,2.684,3.1685,1.1717,3.8981,0.3527,14.7215,8.3963,2.6114,4.4389,0.08,3.7771,2.1421,2.0722,1.608,0.9804,2.0138,1.2828,1.2462,3.5777,1.8817,2.39,2.4591,0.4792,5.2176,0.7859,2.6264,0.1941,0.8181,0.2231,0.1886]}

I was only two years old when I went into the hospital, but I was baptized when I was 13 in a Christian church.\nCould you get baptized as an adult?\nNo, you can't be baptized after you leave the church. Most baptisms are during childhood.\nWhy?\nBecause baptism should be a sacrament for the children (and parents) of God. Baptism is a sign of what God did for us.  I would say that we are baptized into the Holy Spirit at Pentecost or when we have a conversion experience. Then, at some point, you are baptized into Christ, as a person.\nSo I got baptized when I was a baby, but I can't be baptized as an adult?

I suppose it's assumed the kids are growing up, and they moved on from the events in RDR, so they'd have no reason to go back.\nIt was mentioned in the Undead Nightmare DLC, I think.\nNo, Jack says they'll stay in Valentine until she gets everything back in order. They aren't staying, they're just planning on staying.\n> until I can make all my things back.  There's the confirmation right here.  If the place was as important as it was in Revolver, as in they never just left town, then I would be disappointed there was no mention of it again.

At least, I dont remember hearing it as part of the story.\nI would bet that they would mention it at least once in the story to reference that they are out of the country working jobs until they can open up their own saloon\/general store\/warehouse\/etc.","token_len":298,"entropy":[8.7203,3.0558,5.4251,10.2799,4.2176,7.8264,3.9449,1.5902,0.5225,8.1482,1.7877,0.8567,1.6955,5.8984,3.1347,0.0006,2.1159,1.5403,6.8759,2.5361,6.4281,0.6293,7.9461,1.8313,3.3873,0.6822,2.1355,5.5489,1.424,1.7354,8.4159,3.9652,6.1008,2.2592,7.5718,0.102,3.5563,2.5701,2.7117,8.0038,2.8429,2.4354,2.0662,7.1008,3.0114,7.0832,8.7484,1.9294,2.4989,2.5543,3.8184,2.2229,2.7615,3.0349,0.0727,3.3369,0.6582,0.8214,0.9971,3.0468,1.4538,5.9935,1.5446,1.2197,11.4649,4.5983,5.3029,1.3692,4.739,1.2358,1.0093,0.9183,4.5031,0.8177,10.2154,5.1247,4.01,3.5595,4.1275,1.9656,12.9861,8.7881,3.7601,2.7958,7.5448,1.2608,3.1866,1.9756,0.4575,4.0599,5.887,0.0005,4.971,2.5815,2.3511,0.3555,2.1375,7.2256,1.1324,2.6751,1.0578,0.6427,9.1539,11.3136,4.3162,3.5026,3.6175,4.9657,2.2451,4.7625,2.4758,1.3641,6.0395,10.9879,0.9055,4.2915,9.3141,6.4169,2.2655,1.0302,2.7502,4.5692,3.4708,6.0162,2.6476,5.807,5.2208,0.344,1.6484,2.171,1.6011,8.5282,1.399,0.775,5.9192,4.8088,7.6968,4.968,6.4438,2.3607,4.1126,1.1892,2.0714,1.9196,2.8014,2.5476,5.7434,5.8535,2.3201,0.5647,3.8138,0.2337,1.481,3.4274,0.25,2.1656,2.3338,4.5501,5.0033,5.2423,8.3783,1.4051,1.5306,6.0892,5.4264,5.2324,0.0041,0.1619,0.9404,1.8268,1.0677,1.8333,4.9288,9.7133,6.9332,1.563,0.8118,0.8837,3.1981,7.8599,3.6011,9.2521,11.7311,2.9048,0.8476,1.888,4.5506,6.0129,0.8595,0.5227,7.931,5.1942,8.5001,1.497,1.3112,2.9632,7.6841,0.8589,1.6044,3.509,0.5041,1.5705,6.6017,5.2767,1.7889,4.952,0.2083,3.2255,3.3553,1.6115,2.7512,5.2904,6.6599,0.3445,4.9219,2.4469,6.4652,3.349,3.7022,3.6313,5.232,0.8438,5.1528,2.1718,2.7572,2.9757,0.2444,2.4605,8.2269,0.7955,2.821,0.2702,2.5377,4.7742,7.1627,1.7385,4.0501,3.9395,0.6059,6.2935,0.4817,2.1436,2.2531,3.3726,5.7481,6.4506,2.3654,5.1913,3.5777,0.002,0.5282,3.0512,0.7214,0.6966,2.2854,4.3522,4.371,1.9364,2.3498,2.8032,8.2319,1.1965,3.6057,1.5711,0.4458,1.125,0.8346,3.1471,4.5294,8.01,3.3366,1.6739,3.332,4.9914,0.7948,3.5359,3.8603,6.0179,6.5313,5.3647,0.7786,2.3832,6.0208,1.2812,1.7897,2.0226,7.8666,0.6093,4.7,7.1299,0.238,2.6042,10.4904,0.0648,1.9013,1.4124,0.5363]}

A group of intergalactic administrators has been formed to help preserve not only the natural world on Earth, but also the knowledge and wisdom humans are developing through their efforts. The council has granted a group named the Foundation special authority to help humanity survive. The Foundation has two missions. One is to create an artificial environment on Earth that mimics what humans will be seeing and experiencing in the future as humanity attempts to move to a more sustainable society. The other is to help humanity come to terms with its condition by sharing the true value of nature, as revealed by the scientists at the Preservation Council.\n\nIn our first issue, we told you that our journey begins in the year 2801. In this second issue we will explore the world in which these events take place, and how our world will be transformed and enhanced by the efforts of the Preservation Council. To keep you better informed than we were last month, we'll use some of the details in our second issue to provide you with an introduction to the Council.

She speaks to him first, making some conversation in his mother's car as she drops off the boys to school. \"He was beautiful. He was also, like his brother, deaf. He always sat in the back of the classroom listening to music with his mouth closed. He couldn't hear what we were talking about.

All she has is the power to call forth a sound that can cut through time itself, and she is only interested in your soul. The song she calls forth is the song of lost souls. An ever-unfolding dream, and one last chance to be saved.\n\nThis work is my answer to the request to draw something along the lines of a video game\/anime concept. I chose to use the song of lost souls as the basis for this piece, as it has a mystical feeling to it as well as being melancholy and moving. The title is in reference to the song played whenever you die in Kingdom Hearts. The \"Soul Call\" music always makes me think of Sora dying or losing the plot ( and that is in itself poetic ).

The problem with me is that it's too deep for me to see how he did it, what makes it different from a regular death. Maybe he will leave us answers soon enough though.\nNope. It's the end of the cycle because the old gods and the new gods have both won... he only won because old gods were dead.\nYou're right, but the other thing is that he won because everything else in the universe was dead as well. He won because he is part of the universe, he won because he can live on the edge between the old world and the new world, but I don't think the new world and the old will ever have contact again. So there may have been more than one winner. I don't understand why they brought Ragnar back in any case.\nI know.

What he can't see is that the princess has been enchanted by an evil fairy who is now torturing him in a cell, and she is laughing at him. Can he break free of her magic and save the day? Or will he end up the next royal sacrifice?\n\nThis charming and heart-warming tale brings new meaning to the term \"primal fear and anger.\" In fact, it is so good that we're almost inspired to send our own little knight (or damsel) to rescue her.\n\nThis game was created in tribute to the classics. It will take you back to the days when there was no sound effects or flashing screen graphics, but a simple and challenging puzzle adventure game that will leave you with a smile on your face.\n\nThe game is inspired by both the classic \"Wizardry\" games of the 80s and the \"King's Quest\" series of games from Sierra On-Line. A lot of the game's design elements come from the old Sierra games. The game itself is a complete tribute to the old games from the 80s, but it is currently not in a state where it can be considered an officially released game.\n\nPlease note: this game is not 100% complete. To this date, only approximately one of four levels has been finalized and tested. This game is still a work in progress.","token_len":310,"entropy":[11.3649,6.2427,1.3492,7.6763,1.3597,1.7555,4.6009,1.1223,5.2706,6.3648,1.4066,2.9727,1.2194,3.0347,1.1846,1.021,1.2237,1.549,1.9889,1.0869,4.4278,0.675,2.4513,0.8007,2.1703,1.8064,5.5846,1.3506,5.4011,3.1508,3.3605,1.2386,5.8277,3.0504,2.9732,1.2637,1.5789,0.7298,1.0897,0.9701,1.6439,1.5997,1.1917,9.6959,1.2705,3.9782,1.7591,5.4159,2.7918,2.4241,4.5685,7.9629,0.0031,3.4199,3.4102,1.5718,4.7454,2.0926,0.9035,3.0944,1.1631,7.7499,1.149,0.3304,0.7495,7.3139,1.3399,5.6141,2.2764,0.8393,2.1772,3.6954,1.5545,1.7099,1.4476,6.3662,0.3753,3.4027,0.9672,0.7075,3.8573,0.0944,5.0613,3.9179,8.3991,10.2024,0.881,1.6053,0.0507,3.7906,7.5638,2.4537,4.9194,2.0698,0.3329,1.6319,5.5848,6.0561,2.601,0.088,0.7949,6.2844,0.5427,4.9911,4.1385,8.4363,5.6572,5.0373,2.019,3.2188,3.3303,0.0232,1.066,1.8587,3.0406,4.0793,0.5103,3.2183,3.2336,4.2298,5.558,0.4283,5.3758,2.9382,2.7945,3.8281,6.0733,4.3776,2.0303,7.9125,0.0612,0.8708,0.9367,1.8557,2.4936,1.1685,1.1486,0.0003,3.473,4.3784,2.7952,2.1408,2.9676,7.7938,0.0342,1.2624,6.8221,3.3451,2.0735,4.5713,3.3287,1.0497,1.7568,0.2324,0.7519,2.6721,1.2031,3.9858,0.5743,1.0002,7.6936,6.5821,2.192,7.0816,4.9611,6.4397,1.6584,2.1105,4.4098,2.9601,3.1639,6.5175,2.5508,5.6807,4.1553,1.5651,2.2247,4.2024,0.1528,2.2663,1.0347,3.1163,1.6581,0.0178,0.0065,0.3759,0.8974,0.0003,2.6558,1.2552,1.1894,5.3689,0.0331,5.5566,1.7654,1.7235,3.4042,6.1778,2.1634,2.7214,0.5985,2.6814,1.7566,0.2787,2.6226,0.4107,0.3403,1.3655,2.9191,5.6571,2.1989,0.4538,0.2207,1.5159,0.9787,0.9964,2.7351,9.5244,1.8805,0.0926,0.1435,0.4667,4.7966,3.7029,0.1394,1.2598,2.3622,1.3286,3.527,3.8971,3.1661,0.076,1.1223,4.5922,2.6352,1.2522,2.5352,2.0528,1.597,5.0589,0.7068,2.3417,5.4627,6.0054,0.0415,1.0193,3.5275,2.0083,4.4405,0.8219,0.692,0.0453,1.5032,1.7647,1.7981,1.7992,7.6702,4.8772,3.2335,2.8986,3.3219,3.1175,0.6129,1.1043,0.4125,4.2484,2.7081,6.251,2.6984,0.7767,0.1615,0.6402,0.0002,4.3541,1.669,1.5171,2.5716,0.5609,0.8618,1.3224,5.2932,0.0408,2.5862,0.833,4.9875,6.654,2.5505,0.4564,4.0949,7.0569,3.9551,3.2561,5.8405,4.1031,2.356,0.0624,4.7724,2.0933,5.7563,0.8279,3.1008,1.7226,1.1856,2.6555,2.9938,0.4699,0.0359,0.0054,1.4093]}

Unless you had some terrible mutation that caused your cancer to develop very differently, a cure would only work to extend your life by a few weeks to months at most.\nNo need to explain the specifics here. Let's say *The Incurable Cancer Cure*.  Even in the broadest terms, and that is in most cases correct, a cure which would last months to years would be a lifesaver.

One day at work, you become increasingly concerned with these up and coming `` Humans '' and their erratic growth. You have noticed on television, that their language is very odd, much like that of the native species of your planet, and that they have two genders, that seem quite out of whack with their development of the species. The female gender has grown disproportionately large, while the male has not grown at all. While their body shape and movement, seems to indicate that this growth has somehow become advantageous, to the creature, and that it has allowed them to reach their potential...\n\nI'm pretty sure that's the way it goes. The story is that they had two genders on their planet, but they discovered on their home planet that people really only enjoyed one gender at a time, so they separated them. The women became a sort of race of \"goddesses\" and the men were \"warriors\". All that is in the story, though.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and guess I've been reading too many weird fanfic fics where the races or species of our world have evolved some strange way that causes the males and females to be of vastly different sizes....\n\nSo I got this idea out of my head while reading your thread.

{"id":1296,"ended":true,"length":297,"text":"You are a world champion of a certain trading card game. When you pull off a supposedly impossible combo at a tournament you summon a horrifying creature, on live television. You have spent years mastering the deck that got you here. But the game has evolved, and the world of CCGs, while much the same as it was in your youth, is in the midst of radical change. What did you expect?\n\nThe answer is so obvious I find it hard to believe it took me this long to see it, but I don\u2019t understand why this has me so giddy.\n\nIt makes me think of Magic\u2018s development. I only got into the game after the cards got significantly better, but there were also very big changes to the world as a result. I saw people start making decks that were just out of Reach (excuse me, \u201cjust a little too much effort.\u201d) They looked like weird mashups, but the idea that I was in the company of a guy with a $500 Modern deck full of $100+ cards was just so mind-blowing to me. Not bad or good necessarily, but amazing.\n\nThis feels like the same thing. All the players in the article are still good players. But what happened was the game went from being Magic where people just put expensive cards in an awesome deck and you tried to kill them quickly, to actually being a game that has expensive stuff being a viable deck choice. That was so amazing.

It was now a habit of his to sometimes skip his morning meds. The result was that he rarely ever remembered much of anything, and, in his opinion, was very forgetful and lacking in any sort of memory. In his personal opinion, he felt that he was as bad as one could possibly be if one had forgetfulness as the one of the main problems. Then again, there was the whole medication thing to consider.\n\nAs you can see, I am a bad writer. I need to get a good editor to go over my stories more than anything else.

A science organisation finds evidence that a terrifying alien empire will encounter us in 50 years. They must engineer a false flag operation to get the two systems to war with each other to galvanise our weapons and defenses against the aliens. The aliens then destroy our two largest space stations and invade.\n\nWill the world unite together as a single unit? or will they separate along divisive political, social, cultural and religious lines???\n\nIn 2153, an alien invades the earth and plans to end the species. But a group of humans band together to stop the invasion and make their very own alien-killer, a weapon named \"THE MASSACRE\".\n\nEarth has only two years to prepare for the aliens if they intend on attacking. A covert organization known as \"The Program\" recruits a few key people to help assemble this new weapon. However, The Program goes beyond its boundaries to find qualified weapon-makers.

He is the son of the man, who brutally murdered his mother when she chose to remarry. He is an abused alcoholic. But now, years later, he is living the life his mother could not live. His mother had a son who died young, and she wants to try make up for that loss by raising her son to be a good man. She loves him deeply, but he only returns her affection with indifference and violence. One night he kills her, but only as she tries to commit suicide.\n\nLater on, as he is walking home, he is attacked by men and thrown into a field. He wakes up tied to a chair. He is accused of murdering his father and his son. He is given two choices: either he can choose to become a murderer himself, or allow his father\u2019s spirit to live inside him. He chooses the latter. As the years go by, his alcoholism worsens. Then one night, his father attacks him with the intention of killing him...\n\nThis book is a short, but intense tale of loss and tragedy. The language is beautiful, and the characters are all well defined. But although this story is based on a true story, and therefore has a moral to it (the bad things we do to others, do come back to haunt us), it is still a sad read. On that note, I would only advise older children to read it.

When you awaken from death, you lie in front of a large castle with shimmering lights - you've been invited to Death's ball. There's one problem - you don 't know who you are. Then an old, bearded wizard steps up, picks you up by the ankles and drops you into a giant, golden tub of ice water. But now you do know who you are - the Wizard of Oz. An instant later, Oz throws a ball, and everything goes crazy, from Oz and his friends to the ball and the wizard himself. It all ends in a fiery climax - except for Oz and his two friends who live happily ever after. ( from IMDb )\n\nSynopsis:\nThe Oz series was a worldwide cultural phenomenon. Inspired by L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), it has been called \" a classic of children's literature \" that also provided a template for many later fantasy stories ( and that is in itself a source of fantasy ), which may have been more closely associated with the original novel than with the movie adaptations. The series spawned a radio drama, a stage play series, a number of spin-offs in the form of comic strips, and, in later years, several made-for-television movies, culminating in a feature film in 1939. The 1939 film won Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Music, although the original novel had been turned into a stage production in 1919 featuring no sound and few effects.","token_len":326,"entropy":[5.9856,6.9373,1.9061,0.6679,4.5904,4.3023,5.2702,3.2837,1.5365,2.2295,1.7025,4.6364,0.3409,0.9097,7.6065,2.5283,3.7092,3.8218,0.509,0.8178,3.9046,0.7641,0.4018,1.5334,4.5677,0.3715,4.0129,0.5112,5.2347,2.1852,3.3359,0.2383,0.8293,7.8902,1.8417,4.3642,0.0027,1.5732,3.475,7.2846,2.5224,9.3457,0.0093,2.7888,7.7311,2.6046,3.8441,1.8054,7.9078,0.6048,7.7356,1.1683,12.437,1.3995,3.4209,2.1296,4.5128,5.8836,2.1681,1.1924,2.5303,11.262,1.2467,1.7079,2.323,1.3212,0.3849,1.6152,5.8171,5.6474,2.1938,4.5156,4.2902,4.1445,5.3014,2.2621,2.8064,5.8603,0.7927,0.0361,3.4273,0.3404,4.5092,0.6372,5.9023,0.0846,1.5624,0.9432,4.4306,2.9453,4.6485,5.7623,2.4608,4.1788,2.3139,0.4178,5.6025,5.6042,0.9628,6.6602,2.5225,0.6708,0.1967,0.0502,2.2902,2.4163,4.3691,0.8353,3.2202,0.7562,6.0342,7.7797,0.2003,0.3202,4.295,7.1616,2.5461,3.9498,3.8897,1.4274,5.5256,1.9907,5.4296,2.9902,5.2427,6.3396,4.1489,1.8835,3.0628,0.8182,1.3408,6.4458,2.914,1.1015,3.3037,4.5023,0.5943,3.4422,3.5571,1.9131,0.8728,0.8543,4.6694,6.238,2.791,6.4594,0.5463,2.4546,2.0631,0.8582,5.9589,1.5101,1.9881,3.7624,3.4652,0.1177,0.0406,0.427,4.3452,10.1785,7.5469,0.4924,1.2801,0.9433,0.0685,6.9164,1.2688,2.407,16.1084,6.6,4.6299,2.5294,2.0408,6.214,7.6356,0.144,1.6317,6.8029,0.0692,8.1421,1.2392,1.769,0.0097,0.0486,0.3418,2.4634,5.3404,0.0709,0.0505,0.0003,2.5537,7.1932,0.4328,2.3481,4.3227,1.2094,3.7621,1.597,7.7149,2.5354,3.0889,5.895,0.099,0.7596,1.7504,6.49,4.8916,6.574,1.5641,5.9267,0.0814,2.8586,5.2631,6.6242,3.0258,3.7836,6.038,5.5294,2.2021,4.4963,3.9904,1.0261,5.5878,0.1201,6.818,4.8849,3.8904,4.6593,1.4935,1.7654,4.2258,4.9965,1.7293,0.0544,1.4352,4.059,5.4848,1.8763,1.8098,0.7126,4.4734,4.1307,0.4691,1.6879,2.9931,4.9694,1.6146,8.5355,2.4259,1.953,2.1145,5.6076,0.917,4.6092,0.4195,1.1314,6.1505,0.0093,4.8502,0.5068,0.4504,5.1918,1.2477,2.2458,0.0046,4.8924,3.1576,0.5403,0.6669,3.2015,2.2562,4.5272,0.4271,0.0582,3.2544,8.6452,1.7485,0.0428,0.0282,2.9243,0.0088,1.9709,2.1502,7.0695,0.1373,1.9469,4.6692,0.2504,2.8249,3.9058,0.7886,1.5935,7.9874,1.4585,6.4185,3.976,0.9485,0.9435,0.2144,5.3858,0.0563,1.499,1.0723,5.1038,1.9697,4.3929,1.7398,3.5407,4.5182,3.3207,2.5128,5.5871,1.0161,0.2298,5.859,3.3324,2.9687,7.5855,8.8357,4.6843,5.0493,3.4332,4.9327,3.5419,0.4857]}

{"id":1286,"ended":true,"length":304,"text":"Humanity's last act before total destruction by an alien race was force-evolving and genetically 'perfecting'a number of common animal species. 5000 years later, they board starships and fly for the alien's homeworld to avenge the death of their `` Gods '' : Humanity.\n\nThe aliens are a new alien race. Not sure what kind just yet. They are the exact species that the old gods used as hosts for their genes in the human experiments.\n\nThey've built starships now, they can colonize planets and they are smart enough to not do the same things that doomed us. They are also intelligent, but are still learning.\n\nThe Humans, however, have also evolved along with the alien race. There are no humans only hybrids. Humans only act human in front of the aliens.\n\nThe aliens had the capability of killing humans, but they have grown to really not care about us anymore. The only people that still are a threat to them are humans with the blood of the old gods.\n\nHumans use technology and biology in the same way and that is why they can be both strong and intelligent.\n\nThey are not trying to find a way to defeat the aliens, because they know that they can't or that they could only defeat them by making every race in the universe against them. So instead,\n\nhumans are spreading the seed of their alien technology, allowing them to evolve in as many corners of the galaxy as they can.\n\nAt the end, they hope the humans will find a way to defeat the aliens and when they do, they will come help.","token_len":332,"entropy":[7.4121,2.8963,5.9256,5.2043,3.2169,7.8147,2.348,4.7197,4.2429,2.1853,1.5298,2.7355,9.8006,1.0951,7.5645,2.5434,4.2097,6.8615,7.355,5.0399,3.7751,0.1596,11.8462,7.6394,0.0101,7.3371,6.5091,0.7238,1.4189,12.2151,0.6194,1.708,0.4749,4.6865,11.3699,7.9991,0.0062,1.7623,4.4815,5.7034,2.0276,7.0998,4.5282,3.8069,0.003,3.138,5.2445,2.7397,1.1326,1.5969,0.0383,0.9235,14.9493,14.2727,4.73,7.3042,5.4089,1.7924,2.0953,0.047,2.2145,3.3167,2.3865,3.5664,5.3107,4.6637,0.6971,3.1358,5.1378,5.1818,1.4259,4.6312,9.5325,3.858,1.4733,3.2105,1.4054,3.4311,6.0248,5.2208,1.8451,2.6447,6.7628,3.6556,4.0765,2.6182,6.3729,1.1894,1.0519,8.7284,3.9771,1.5851,5.0969,8.9375,1.3028,1.7181,0.0004,3.0857,4.3527,4.9009,6.6195,0.0109,6.7015,1.3984,3.7137,3.5238,6.5586,0.1843,1.2719,1.3241,4.4158,2.4536,6.9,0.6441,0.1099,4.5442,5.5604,3.3588,1.3684,2.9724,2.3149,9.7908,3.1584,1.2562,2.0264,1.8206,3.2011,3.2416,2.4813,2.6931,3.9456,3.1141,6.2126,1.8305,1.0941,0.0003,2.4254,5.0784,3.6637,4.2007,0.0754,1.8953,4.9853,3.9249,7.0704,0.597,1.5111,2.341,0.6589,0.7571,4.7757,0.8294,2.7059,2.7776,9.171,7.4241,1.5451,2.7185,4.8177,7.4722,5.2192,3.0091,7.0333,0.0206,1.2969,2.227,0.7812,1.2994,0.0004,1.7904,1.6286,5.587,3.4588,4.4793,1.7033,4.3191,1.8898,1.8707,0.9648,1.5083,2.8006,5.7191,1.8113,6.3994,6.2437,2.5074,0.5732,3.7877,2.6569,0.2353,2.7003,3.1684,3.5095,1.8252,3.8628,4.5049,4.4351,1.4114,0.5237,1.8338,0.3808,2.4822,4.9642,2.2409,6.1013,0.5539,2.0108,5.1345,0.1934,1.0459,0.7658,0.0003,4.9197,0.0052,6.3188,3.4531,2.6898,6.5032,3.0864,2.484,1.6873,0.1749,5.1179,3.9495,1.4389,1.6271,1.3127,3.2897,3.2141,5.5791,5.5265,0.1681,2.8086,0.3847,1.2398,0.0003,2.321,1.4057,2.7132,5.6106,0.033,5.6184,1.4485,1.4881,0.625,4.1881,1.4214,1.4959,1.4106,5.046,1.1361,2.1615,1.0508,1.8633,1.9117,1.9644,5.7213,7.675,0.9895,4.0767,4.2422,2.7921,0.9078,1.9644,4.699,6.9394,4.8645,4.0404,0.4022,1.8154,8.3978,1.1318,0.5469,4.5764,4.3757,1.3941,8.3272,0.0005,4.2064,1.8611,7.9793,1.9385,5.343,0.3538,2.3655,5.3568,4.0588,2.5643,5.3737,1.0368,0.0717,4.243,3.2887,6.8323,1.6583,8.2738,0.2859,0.1359,1.2663,0.2023,1.0287,1.641,0.8353,0.4936,0.0003,5.8668,1.0314,1.4087,3.0982,1.9364,5.6006,3.6061,2.7933,0.7875,3.2266,0.9847,0.1098,0.1739,2.0327,0.8067,0.2629,1.567,6.476,1.0032,0.4335,0.4208,0.9419,0.4477,4.5224,9.6107,4.5655]}

However, on the other hand, there is no need to rush the launch of an App like this or any other App for that matter. I would rather have the company take their time, make sure everything works as intended and ensure that everything is perfect.\n\nIf you\u2019re really eager to get the App on your console, you can sign up for a Nintendo account at nintendo.co.uk. To get the new app when they release it, link your Nintendo Network ID to your existing Nintendo Account. If you prefer to keep your online data on your console and your profile on the website, don\u2019t link it right now simply because it\u2019s the holiday season and Nintendo wants to give you something to go on while you\u2019re shopping.","token_len":337,"entropy":[12.5614,2.2678,2.1915,4.075,7.083,2.3341,8.1065,5.8158,0.9172,0.0014,2.6416,2.2357,0.1812,3.431,0.289,3.074,11.5224,0.0137,0.561,2.7827,4.7895,2.1896,2.1263,0.9189,2.0859,1.6876,5.3434,2.9459,3.3136,0.4645,1.3414,3.9158,6.3144,1.793,4.6427,7.5582,0.5028,0.5637,0.812,0.7588,4.7292,5.2923,1.483,2.3331,1.7347,1.7676,0.8283,0.0338,4.3089,2.6278,7.2008,5.1673,1.3344,4.3895,0.9421,4.901,1.1515,1.1045,4.2294,4.2599,3.0387,0.7808,2.0025,6.2066,0.4877,5.5605,0.3174,1.7653,4.9963,2.9436,16.3228,6.5431,1.9121,0.8773,1.8006,0.8913,0.6521,1.0219,0.0002,2.033,2.4375,0.0041,0.5476,0.248,1.0917,6.7125,13.5252,2.6135,5.3012,0.7315,1.2476,1.6356,3.7345,2.4968,1.4919,12.3927,1.2039,1.0759,8.7607,0.8361,1.631,3.3064,3.1951,2.0972,5.0883,3.1318,0.5402,4.0589,0.1115,5.0318,1.0544,1.074,2.2781,1.4011,2.0136,2.5567,2.3759,2.5096,1.2124,7.1387,0.1315,2.7999,0.132,0.1135,3.725,2.3861,3.5663,6.7305,3.1795,0.9791,0.0002,5.0865,1.3827,5.7463,0.0826,0.229,2.4766,3.9299,2.2903,5.6092,0.9703,0.8059,4.2933,0.9036,2.0944,0.3323,0.3693,2.0052,1.5517,0.1136,1.0564,6.5536,1.156,4.6318,4.4745,1.441,0.7154,0.026,2.7669,3.9083,6.1322,3.6455,3.9461,1.1867,0.5805,1.8427,4.465,3.6881,2.1291,1.3506,6.697,0.6877,6.0084,6.7528,1.2025,0.1257,1.25,7.1166,1.7571,2.77,0.029,3.2064,0.0402,0.0354,0.0816,0.127,2.1419,1.9907,2.0575,2.7032,0.3213,4.1413,1.0519,1.8014,0.8483,4.519,0.3002,3.5811,0.384,5.5115,4.1213,0.372,1.851,3.3052,2.538,0.0661,0.1311,4.9078,2.9531,2.3402,2.8448,1.8822,6.991,3.3652,4.4357,0.4356,3.5503,4.2492,1.1538,4.339,2.2933,2.3582,2.7146,1.6303,4.6465,0.7864,3.3365,0.9631,4.049,0.6738,0.4454,0.0002,3.2662,0.2017,6.1898,0.2346,1.9454,5.521,6.4503,0.4442,1.6697,2.9787,1.7924,2.4208,1.4108,6.0391,0.4613,1.7024,0.7479,1.7058,0.0615,0.5104,1.7275,3.008,5.2336,2.5631,5.7172,0.0598,0.1195,3.0111,0.1163,2.3332,1.3905,4.7629,2.1863,1.0785,4.9436,2.5178,7.0883,3.6261,1.8359,0.3462,0.7047,9.0434,1.1886,0.8743,7.3816,4.1063,0.7008,0.3524,5.6902,0.5533,1.1558,1.0967,2.7764,0.2168,5.7774,0.998,3.5682,0.7141,4.73,4.2772,3.5625,0.7787,3.9577,3.0275,3.1175,3.8194,2.3317,1.156,4.4532,0.3455,5.5112,0.1802,0.5014,0.0004,6.7044,1.7919,5.8275,1.0403,8.0425,1.7214,1.4248,3.2858,0.1527,0.8459,4.1108,9.893,0.1453,1.8087,4.7456,4.436,0.7335,3.0839,0.4799,3.179,1.2364,4.5858,2.0365,4.5874,0.5012,3.083,0.3527,0.4124,4.837,0.5982]}

It hasn't, and, in fact, the radiation intensity is...\n\nA few years and five Voyager encounters later, it was discovered that the interstellar medium is full of dust. When the spacecrafts had left the local interstellar medium, there were enough electrons and protons in the space to produce ultraviolet radiation, which then ionized the interstellar medium.\n\nAfter a careful look, the researchers were able to determine that the interstellar medium between our sun and the planets was much thicker, by as much as 30%. At this point, Voyager was approximately 50 light years from the nearest star.\n\nNASA has given us a nice long distance shot of the probe, and we've included the image down below. While Voyager is traveling at roughly 30,000 miles per hour, this means that it's zipping along the edge of the Milky Way as it moves out of our home galaxy.\n\nIf you're wondering where you can find this super slow motion footage of the Voyager 2 spacecraft, well, here you go. And it's not bad for something recorded only nine months ago.","token_len":341,"entropy":[8.0906,1.9601,1.3126,0.3538,7.164,6.2876,1.3986,11.6249,0.0444,0.0038,0.3551,0.6135,0.6814,8.0873,2.5397,1.3033,6.7163,3.9477,2.5111,12.0959,0.0048,8.5056,0.8375,3.1546,5.3173,4.0862,1.3445,4.9847,0.2079,5.5883,7.0324,4.7278,0.871,0.1839,3.1803,1.5069,4.636,4.6412,2.3966,2.3038,6.2024,2.5175,1.6372,3.4505,6.2236,9.0795,2.3727,8.1686,0.3704,0.0002,3.1729,4.0269,6.0761,2.9385,2.9037,6.1336,0.9636,0.0031,2.6284,5.6851,2.7175,2.4272,5.7989,1.887,8.1961,0.4274,0.3278,0.5659,5.5053,0.1322,1.2148,2.4764,0.6519,5.7805,2.0268,3.7342,2.1088,3.4604,0.829,4.5004,3.6602,4.0213,0.1983,5.2325,4.8021,5.8187,0.5157,7.6189,1.6875,0.9484,0.7776,3.3023,2.6029,3.6116,5.8079,4.0498,1.9501,2.7071,4.9017,5.6282,2.6272,0.4873,7.2249,0.0017,1.2935,3.3154,0.7085,4.1254,2.1583,3.7202,6.4928,3.4237,0.8915,2.9861,1.4462,0.4462,4.174,9.5736,0.5595,1.8109,1.5537,3.1942,6.3055,0.0006,2.2733,1.1248,4.4281,2.9751,0.3641,0.0028,2.5073,5.497,5.6923,1.2609,7.9326,0.757,0.0001,4.1601,3.843,3.0555,7.468,4.5353,7.7774,6.5182,0.7032,0.0882,3.2364,3.2524,3.1486,0.3413,1.0433,6.9455,0.6154,1.3535,5.4211,0.0348,5.8953,1.29,4.4157,1.5318,2.0941,8.7619,4.9773,3.9505,1.0004,7.36,4.284,0.7645,0.5566,3.4899,1.166,5.3414,6.26,2.7698,0.7064,0.0002,1.4165,0.7149,4.7722,3.6628,2.863,6.9311,0.9455,1.5605,1.1535,4.2059,6.6691,0.1052,0.702,2.1937,0.0714,0.7453,1.9416,0.0002,6.0358,2.238,6.8574,3.5288,1.1754,1.4516,3.6156,2.9869,0.2818,0.0057,2.4017,0.3539,0.8171,2.0865,0.0357,8.1127,2.6911,3.0424,0.0765,0.8871,4.2537,1.8796,3.4056,3.1681,2.6165,6.5658,5.346,0.0448,0.0008,3.5483,5.4202,4.8893,1.9136,1.5138,0.2638,2.781,2.0247,6.0666,3.5276,2.3564,2.7689,0.9122,1.9657,2.4207,0.8885,1.0261,0.9492,0.0003,5.1384,3.706,5.1806,2.019,1.1026,5.6786,5.8496,6.955,3.9428,1.2934,1.3892,4.1917,1.5084,1.8749,2.0321,2.7078,6.081,2.25,3.0152,7.9123,0.3232,0.7551,6.0597,1.9217,1.3107,4.0551,0.7682,4.1584,3.9122,1.3591,0.0768,0.8074,0.107,0.1374,0.308,3.4722,4.5835,0.7401,1.4655,1.5984,8.749,0.7517,2.7981,3.5625,4.0258,0.0262,0.7572,3.7232,0.0005,4.7155,1.0939,3.429,5.166,0.4038,1.9503,6.4224,0.4479,0.5073,0.9667,0.0002,3.5024,0.7813,1.5209,2.3883,2.7183,3.4664,1.8735,1.9107,2.093,6.2427,7.1099,5.7692,4.9302,1.2754,1.453,0.8967,4.421,1.9082,0.4064,4.5493,0.217,2.2236,2.9468,0.0863,0.5428,4.899,3.9909,0.4913,2.4877,4.4537,3.7206,5.1808,10.1643,4.4416,5.8389,1.5782,0.5929,0.5892]}

Instead of a crash report, a message is sent back to Earth : `` You have attempted to breach the quarentine. Your attempt has been noted to local authorities. ''\n\nThe authorities are the Interplanetary Criminal Investigation Division, a spacefaring intergovernmental body established to tackle the rise of interplanetary crime. An Earth-based, human-driven space ship is headed to Pluto to investigate the mysterious explosion of the human-manned space ship Voyager 8. And because the authorities are dealing with interplanetary crime, this is no ordinary crew of heroes ; this is the International Police of Space.\n\nAfter leaving Earth, the Voyager 8 is now only 7 light years away from the mysterious explosion. A call to the spacecraft has not been answered, but the ship is detected as not responding. An investigation reveals that the hull of the Voyager 8 is fractured and the space craft is a hundred thousand kilometers away from the nearest planet, Neptune. The police are concerned that the ship could explode in the near future and wipe out our planet.\n\nWe don't need to say how dangerous interplanetary crime can be ; all you need to know is that only the International Police of Space can stop it. In this thrilling sequel, interplanetary crime takes off : criminals start interplanetary ships, kidnapping innocent people and transporting them back to their planets.

{"id":2107,"ended":false,"length":323,"text":"A company decides to let children make the decisions during 'take your child to work day'\nThe title is a bit sensationalist. The children can vote for who they think is the best at the company, and they vote at the company itself (so it's not remotely democratic).\nIt's still a good thing, though I wonder what the parents think about it.\n\nFrom the article: \"At one point, kids at the plant chose a new flooring for one of the walls because they thought it looked better.\"\n\nIt looks like they only vote on who should lead the company if they had never held a job yet. The last paragraph says it was a contest to who was the best to work for.\n\nYeah, at the end of the article it states the children chose the company to work for.\n\nI'd be happy to work there. :)\n\nI guess I will do that instead of paying taxes.\n\nWhat's so bad about that?\nJust because we have a social contract with the government doesn't mean it should necessarily cover everyone - everyone has to work for a living.\n\nPeople can work for a living without paying taxes; I do it all the time, but I don't feel like I have to.\n\nWhy would you avoid paying your taxes?\n\nBecause the government forces me to pay those taxes on items that I do want to buy (sadly), and those aren't always of the highest quality. My favorite example: taxes on bottled water. Why should I (or anybody) pay taxes on something that I want to buy in order to get it for free from the faucet?\n\nThen don't buy bottled water...?","token_len":349,"entropy":[8.2155,10.2039,1.479,5.5362,7.4924,4.8852,3.422,3.1819,7.549,8.3603,7.7061,4.2731,3.5186,1.9206,3.8442,3.4186,0.7655,2.4003,12.0555,8.6285,2.8434,1.8161,2.7985,9.2121,1.4433,2.2437,2.4686,3.7848,4.3519,5.9528,1.6304,3.8351,0.4936,4.5259,1.2821,1.4058,0.8241,4.7389,2.5303,4.1502,1.2221,1.6017,2.5377,4.5581,4.2373,1.1246,1.7811,5.4854,3.9648,4.6588,2.6192,0.6985,1.4578,8.0401,5.8395,0.8357,1.6819,3.1694,0.7206,5.7413,1.7628,3.8233,2.2845,2.2993,1.7094,4.9072,4.3631,2.5525,1.6592,4.7278,1.9399,1.5761,0.982,0.447,1.088,9.1569,6.3533,1.54,3.9401,0.3368,2.9645,4.8309,4.0847,0.6771,1.0157,7.2898,4.542,1.8655,6.786,5.7838,2.3832,4.6738,10.0283,3.2437,2.3967,5.4207,0.7112,0.8471,5.3314,4.8774,1.6852,1.6468,0.4151,1.2857,1.9554,2.6597,0.4309,0.0033,2.9051,4.012,1.0535,2.2917,5.8629,4.2857,2.4585,3.1447,4.6417,6.4088,0.6843,1.0448,5.1385,0.7685,6.194,6.4159,5.6586,1.1154,0.7421,7.7209,0.3821,3.3908,5.981,3.9424,2.1335,2.5267,2.3942,1.8818,7.2467,2.3562,6.2568,2.6947,1.035,0.3963,4.944,3.4764,1.2185,1.3426,0.712,0.0004,6.8277,0.2834,5.5448,2.5969,1.7559,0.2725,0.1849,2.6305,2.4456,3.7263,3.0154,3.7979,5.1203,1.4985,2.1776,3.2033,2.5402,0.8355,1.3105,0.966,0.0003,2.4481,3.6527,2.2093,2.6421,0.2603,4.7608,3.181,2.1066,6.6305,0.4655,0.0003,2.4657,3.6184,1.6976,3.8983,4.5538,2.147,5.9036,1.7453,5.0747,4.1192,1.0975,0.7404,0.0003,4.2148,2.352,4.3658,2.6206,0.0776,2.8127,0.4862,0.5302,20.0703,2.2287,3.9661,1.9233,1.5794,5.3298,1.8808,2.6364,1.6517,1.0543,1.2703,0.0002,0.0741,2.0738,2.5852,6.5857,5.9903,4.083,5.6213,5.1242,2.0868,1.5431,2.9952,0.8469,2.9073,1.5525,0.4424,0.5023,0.0002,4.6804,2.8313,3.0193,0.9916,1.8378,0.1239,3.9464,1.3241,0.2604,5.8569,3.8538,3.9661,4.4048,3.2537,0.162,0.004,1.8716,1.3766,1.3706,1.9018,0.0004,3.4553,1.1879,0.8812,1.6261,0.5167,1.506,0.3596,0.0002,4.407,2.3848,2.012,7.2397,1.6614,4.8892,0.3206,1.2968,0.363,0.0003,2.9188,2.7897,1.0024,6.4857,4.7216,0.1598,2.8831,5.092,0.2245,4.3235,8.6992,1.5327,1.0574,3.391,5.9391,0.2532,2.499,3.0847,5.8402,5.0616,0.3431,6.0104,1.2916,4.0832,4.7433,0.0004,4.7058,6.2508,2.3033,1.9985,0.4832,0.4419,6.2398,6.1479,2.6139,3.337,7.1232,0.7582,6.6916,0.2445,0.6282,6.0354,3.0632,0.437,8.2217,1.2142,4.2195,1.4375,0.6383,1.6373,0.6963,3.3205,0.828,0.8429,2.6034,0.1458,0.8141,5.0118,2.1833,0.0256,2.4554,1.6755,2.8446,1.4481,5.4269,0.7066,8.2454,2.6583,0.1111,0.7789,0.3834,0.0002,6.1227,6.2978,0.0014,2.5353,1.4929,0.02,11.142]}

The prisoners are all space faring criminals who have been sent to die on the Moon, while Dave is a time traveler who has been captured, locked in a cell and forced to repeat four times the same offense he committed in the past--killing a woman named Alice. And because he will be put to death next, the authorities don't want to be caught napping, if he is.\n\nAlice, meanwhile, has been transported to the Moon to be one of the prisoners. To her surprise, she is immediately rescued by Dave--and because everything else in the universe is controlled by machines, it really seems as though he has materialized out of thin air. Alice wants to know a few things about the criminal who has saved her life, and because Dave is too innocent and too pure in her eyes, she tries to seduce him. But he refuses. He also refuses to tell her his name, where he has come from or what has caused him to kill Alice, all of which infuriates her. At first Dave tries to run away, but eventually Alice forces him to accept her challenge, allowing them to become lovers as well as prisoners.\n\nAlice has a very peculiar gift: She can take photographs out of Dave's mind--of the past, of the future, and of the immediate present. And because this special power also allows her to see into everyone else's subconscious, she uses it to expose both Dave's secrets and Alice herself.

{"id":2414,"ended":true,"length":346,"text":"The little white lie that changed the course of history...\nIt is a curious thing, isn't it? Lying about an illness, even a pretty bad one, can be a way of avoiding responsibility in a family, of avoiding loss of livelihoods. But there are circumstances in which those lies can be the difference between life and death. My mother lied for years, and it helped me, saved me, to find out. She'd kept me on the line when she was feeling really awful one night, making up all sorts of horrors about how she had cancer and had to go home to die. The last words she'd spoken to me before hanging up to die were, \"I'll call you tomorrow, darling.\"\nAfter a few months, she called me a few times to tell me how much more ill she was than she'd said. I was too scared to tell her I'd heard that before. I let her continue to tell everyone I was worried about her that she was dying. She eventually had to go into hospital for tests, which showed that she had a tumour in her liver. She couldn't have any chemotherapy treatment; the tumour was too big. The only alternative was surgery.\nMy mother died. I was 16. Then my father came down from Scotland, and at last I had someone to talk to about this.

{"id":223,"ended":true,"length":345,"text":"You can move freely through time, but are incapable of moving through space, so you would experience the paradox itself as you move through a time paradox  You can't leave a time paradox, it will suck you through time, trapping you forever\nSo if i was trapped in \"A time paradox\" i would be trapped in every moment of time up until i came back. And because of that im trapped in every timeline where i never go back.\nNo. You would be trapped in the infinite time line, where you go back and kill yourself in every possible moment until you are the cause of the paradox  If the paradox causes time to stop for you, then you will be trapped forever as your time line is the only one in which there was no paradox to begin with\nOk, let me rephrase. Imagine i have a time paradox where I kill myself in the past (I guess thats in the infinite time line where Im there right?) But then go back and kill myself but there is no paradox because i never go back. Then i go back and kill myself again but there is and infinite time loop.   Now if the paradox goes back and lets me out (Like you just described) is there a way i could get back to the point where the loop started?\nIf you kill yourself at a certain time in the past, that is the only time of time that you exist.

Everything that is now around us happened as a result of this \u201cbeginning.\u201d","token_len":356,"entropy":[9.1106,2.8165,2.3598,7.8478,2.3494,1.6689,1.1144,3.7856,5.681,0.472,1.2082,0.6238,1.7933,0.0499,2.4682,4.5851,1.7317,1.8932,3.5151,0.0168,4.5235,2.0913,0.2793,5.6286,3.9744,3.7978,5.6674,0.3861,0.2649,2.1727,1.9108,1.9751,3.293,5.0082,5.5297,2.2734,1.857,7.0506,5.8178,1.2392,3.2895,8.4726,0.0649,5.0595,0.8908,4.9202,0.178,2.4118,2.4905,1.3654,2.4433,7.4064,2.4944,1.7694,5.9618,0.5521,4.1964,5.3859,5.9052,0.0021,0.0002,1.2729,8.2016,1.8922,2.1423,4.313,2.0824,4.555,3.3077,4.8507,2.9823,1.8203,0.0003,1.9733,5.1515,3.8931,5.7064,3.3175,0.5453,0.1921,3.7038,4.4992,1.1205,3.0981,0.0078,5.4033,5.9791,1.5928,5.284,1.3081,0.7913,0.227,0.1453,3.2825,2.0825,1.4175,4.1595,4.1054,2.6048,1.4828,4.9992,1.5097,5.6962,3.644,0.0691,3.1519,0.7432,2.6278,6.6673,2.2722,5.7576,1.626,9.4005,0.8034,1.8157,8.8353,0.044,5.4036,1.731,2.6966,0.1973,1.4012,0.0002,2.1925,5.5802,6.3212,1.4221,3.8175,0.8704,1.2164,5.8712,4.4545,0.0706,0.675,5.6777,0.6943,0.9703,6.624,4.1327,2.0091,0.0144,2.6204,2.7932,2.9164,6.7581,4.1806,5.7845,4.1382,7.3833,7.8228,1.0224,4.6821,0.1115,0.4082,1.1455,0.0002,4.236,2.7355,0.7032,0.9801,2.0836,5.7859,0.1842,0.2586,1.1237,0.0001,3.7429,2.2826,0.1145,4.4463,1.456,1.2952,1.0868,3.1636,5.843,1.0949,1.9216,4.099,7.4078,4.91,2.2655,4.8841,0.4368,3.6545,1.3135,4.4111,3.8235,0.4509,0.6335,0.6722,2.4246,1.5279,0.0002,3.2592,4.1515,1.561,1.1921,0.1653,1.2118,2.9191,6.7625,0.009,2.7478,2.6866,2.4972,0.2803,0.1272,7.078,1.8744,0.9663,6.6999,5.5616,0.8265,6.6627,0.9699,1.386,0.223,0.0002,3.6634,1.0193,6.8307,1.3357,1.6026,1.4883,4.4964,17.7936,8.1478,3.0543,2.906,1.1003,5.851,5.8751,6.5185,6.9306,0.2212,2.3028,2.98,7.0934,7.0969,2.6285,0.2995,1.8924,2.332,0.6465,4.6314,0.1907,3.1747,1.3197,1.5079,2.7721,1.8832,2.1438,0.0037,2.1143,4.5886,1.7912,1.8125,1.3464,4.4089,5.3637,2.7942,4.4894,1.3037,0.3783,0.2038,0.0002,4.461,1.2742,0.1404,5.1996,2.5177,7.9455,7.0308,3.3806,3.5255,3.7654,1.436,3.2461,0.0011,3.4663,6.1053,2.367,15.581,5.7547,5.8122,2.5865,8.1246,4.6368,1.33,0.5934,0.0023,0.634,5.7489,2.7444,3.9483,2.9376,5.3878,1.0538,0.7284,1.4887,0.4995,1.7097,1.0148,3.4226,1.2985,0.7167,3.4519,5.1343,2.3069,7.831,6.764,0.3113,4.9722,1.6723,2.7047,2.5462,0.3415,2.873,1.185,4.9763,6.3384,0.9917,6.1619,0.3948,0.8107,0.177,0.221,0.0001,2.5978,4.3193,5.3089,4.4122,3.8672,0.049,2.1941,2.7495,5.4681,1.9661,2.581,4.2366,2.8024,0.2135,6.3353,3.455,1.4914,0.2028,0.0143,3.2348,10.7808,0.1152,6.8288,0.1757,3.088,5.6429,4.1464]}

So they have to make adjustments at multiple stages of a project to account for both methods.\nI guess I understand that, we also deal with inches and feet in the states (I understand we will most likely be switching to metric eventually) and all of the engineers I work with still speak in imperial measurements sometimes. But in my engineering work I have never had to switch units for anything. I work for a civil company and it\u2019s primarily steel and concrete.\nYeah I totally get that. My Dad is an industrial designer and does a lot of his work in 2D CAD and CAM packages that use inches, although metric is becoming more common in those as well.

I do all my engineering in CAD and CAM and the way I design and view things in CAD will almost always translate to inches (though sometimes it can get a little hairy with some angles).","token_len":357,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,1.8286,8.2092,4.0043,0.9337,8.8601,0.0368,2.0986,13.1918,3.7153,0.0048,1.1857,1.2537,8.5625,3.329,0.0008,1.8075,2.1816,8.2349,0.0514,2.6366,5.3972,3.5732,1.6038,2.1912,0.0677,2.8363,2.7298,6.7864,7.276,0.3932,0.003,0.3269,3.8097,0.914,3.2629,5.0662,1.4099,5.1695,2.9562,0.0116,3.7893,3.2443,4.4902,7.9861,2.7685,1.5008,2.6681,5.1442,0.0533,0.4367,1.2293,2.7342,2.4218,17.0866,8.6643,1.3041,3.1702,1.8374,1.842,5.831,0.2849,1.5996,3.1664,0.2033,2.9179,0.2006,0.7268,2.2782,7.5076,0.2297,1.9419,6.9102,1.9284,7.5592,4.3562,2.636,4.4796,6.7959,1.5026,1.5971,3.8114,2.3505,2.0841,4.5668,0.5225,7.8275,3.0186,3.7612,7.7164,4.976,1.7418,4.401,3.3434,7.0495,4.4166,4.3972,5.8322,1.7684,4.1807,0.4821,2.1984,2.9414,2.9232,0.7607,7.1182,1.1763,6.1729,4.6761,5.9543,1.6835,4.5092,0.489,0.5078,0.6537,0.0343,0.436,2.3966,5.3732,3.4063,1.5302,5.2616,3.8566,10.7183,6.0278,1.186,0.8274,2.4643,4.9244,1.1381,0.8299,4.3588,1.4439,0.0174,6.2643,6.2544,2.902,14.9485,5.2521,1.6219,4.1836,2.7421,2.6634,1.0497,3.0833,3.9703,5.2246,6.6279,4.8276,1.4773,3.704,2.2109,1.944,4.2806,0.0114,6.2583,9.3476,1.0026,1.7979,2.1712,5.162,1.9853,4.6662,1.2985,3.8572,6.891,5.885,6.4934,0.1167,9.4808,1.5588,4.3705,2.3596,1.6442,6.5876,4.8625,2.8806,4.576,4.6814,5.24,6.3708,0.2446,2.6343,6.9333,0.5037,0.5792,5.7397,2.263,1.4374,5.5316,1.4574,2.2742,8.6921,3.485,2.0294,0.1569,5.9949,6.2052,3.5501,3.9977,7.5495,6.5373,0.5691,1.8539,4.0316,2.4273,9.7275,3.7823,1.0848,2.1882,2.5269,3.0506,1.2181,5.6411,4.3132,3.2444,3.0569,1.3779,1.6984,5.5724,3.2774,1.571,9.6202,5.5899,1.4152,3.0566,6.5662,0.4833,0.0598,8.8046,8.6603,1.8257,2.4051,1.0721,1.6465,7.6089,2.8962,6.4553,3.3943,1.0151,1.1725,5.4895,8.6656,2.499,2.6267,3.7781,3.3137,0.9295,5.9744,1.8659,0.2612,0.0249,5.0263,1.8731,0.5871,8.4381,0.8813,4.8237,1.5025,10.1406,9.8039,4.7053,3.1645,5.6842,2.3017,7.3191,6.1131,1.4404,6.4189,1.4171,1.5388,2.033,4.7344,7.2327,0.2582,0.1519,4.8515,6.0127,3.8137,3.9831,4.3741,3.4434,3.3599,3.7497,6.4862,3.6876,3.2268,1.254,7.3271,2.2426,5.2856,0.8897,0.0102,0.3782,1.0191,5.4926,4.0148,6.1463,3.0786,1.3047,1.4015,1.2576,0.7756,0.8931,1.6524,2.3974,0.6722,0.0751,0.0231,7.5722,3.9429,3.8098,2.178,3.356,2.6217,3.9628,1.3982,1.9651,3.4925,6.2316,1.5784,1.896,2.8962,4.3777,0.8208,2.6102,2.2012,3.5164,4.5322,1.4982,4.2858,2.1905,9.5232,1.6236,3.0176,2.4816,4.8579,5.1181,0.4832,4.1281,0.8141,2.3172,3.9121,3.8791,3.9752,1.9887,2.3038,4.2917,1.3633,0.5311,4.6307,3.6888,2.8646,5.5089,1.0717]}

I have lost track of things because life got away from me, and I got very busy with other things. I'm sorry, if I failed to write about some of things that I said I would do. I'm also sorry if I said I had something to say about something but had nothing important to say...\n\nSo to all those who have been writing me messages lately - I was just a bit busy, I promise! And a few of you may have noticed that I changed my profile picture. I changed is because I felt I needed to change it. I have been thinking about all the things I wanted to do this year and I've decided that the first thing I need to do or achieve for myself is have a break and work on some things that I've always wanted to do\n\nSo here it is. I plan to work on my writing for a while as well as trying to get back into gaming. Then after six months or so take a break from writing to do things I want out of life. If anyone want to write stuff with me I'd be happy to work on them. I'm very open to working on stuff with other writers.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a resolution. Just something I need to do to get back into shape and to actually do something with my life. Sorry if this is vague but I had some plans and now this isn't so sure.","token_len":357,"entropy":[7.0024,7.5831,4.2034,0.7569,13.4941,7.6622,5.5905,8.0934,3.2865,5.3419,1.5699,7.7143,0.9752,2.0557,12.09,8.7498,0.0768,5.2025,6.5916,3.8593,0.0622,9.2522,1.2314,4.7722,2.6351,3.0332,0.9436,0.0003,5.2946,5.4973,0.7706,4.063,6.3133,4.5018,0.484,2.0603,1.4597,0.0003,4.1583,3.4654,0.6184,1.1013,2.2565,0.1178,0.8665,2.9835,5.4758,5.7792,1.1503,1.5952,0.7547,1.2514,1.4859,1.8671,5.0725,0.0096,3.2426,0.2978,8.9017,2.5861,2.7117,0.7713,0.2217,1.4281,3.1077,1.9502,1.804,2.4946,0.8498,3.9056,0.3911,0.4049,0.4711,1.8069,2.7657,6.296,3.0004,0.0616,4.8917,4.2896,7.103,4.8835,5.9146,0.1912,0.0988,1.6882,1.1821,0.9021,5.4368,4.1407,3.0549,1.9458,2.5283,0.3064,0.9345,1.2856,2.7641,3.3689,1.6975,5.4326,1.4247,7.2265,0.929,1.9727,2.3431,4.1795,0.7375,3.9375,1.5396,1.2242,4.7335,2.4458,1.7699,2.69,4.8869,1.2017,2.2475,3.7315,0.7571,0.8741,0.4116,5.1288,1.538,3.2707,4.7522,0.9962,0.5272,0.9768,3.2336,5.0732,4.1553,2.2966,5.7464,0.1337,0.0927,6.0519,1.3127,0.0002,4.2533,4.8732,3.57,2.5888,0.648,0.9545,1.8613,4.6633,4.297,6.3415,4.7772,3.8193,1.6588,5.1639,2.6506,3.5566,2.9174,3.2121,2.2619,2.3374,7.3841,3.4044,3.8734,5.2567,2.0702,1.3253,0.5085,3.2714,0.9099,2.234,1.077,0.3417,6.1697,0.4346,3.2993,0.4654,3.1215,1.1353,3.0026,10.2011,4.1709,0.542,3.5302,2.0045,1.8909,0.3775,2.9003,2.8148,1.2491,1.0541,3.4565,2.1386,3.6344,0.3212,4.9399,1.7352,0.576,0.8194,3.571,0.1549,1.9949,3.0475,0.1028,1.5655,1.4667,2.8558,2.1451,1.427,3.7528,5.0787,1.5379,0.5891,2.5421,0.1475,0.0998,8.0339,6.1289,4.3303,2.0561,0.3985,5.2334,1.0793,6.9321,2.488,5.4463,0.8387,2.2534,1.5231,1.7568,0.5215,2.6693,3.6145,0.2093,0.1791,0.2568,7.1165,0.0003,2.6402,2.2033,2.1888,0.0683,1.6758,1.2789,5.8637,0.6772,4.4072,0.4195,2.2741,4.0468,2.226,1.4996,1.1654,4.3854,1.9228,0.5837,4.4803,0.2837,1.7155,2.2499,1.2657,8.9988,1.3073,5.2539,4.4581,7.069,0.3386,3.0961,0.0596,8.3333,0.8423,0.2989,2.4084,2.2324,2.6657,2.8655,4.2502,1.6068,2.6102,7.426,0.3466,0.8132,0.9128,3.8581,5.4203,7.6606,0.1868,3.8276,7.5477,5.5227,0.1027,2.7181,1.5402,2.048,0.7838,0.0411,3.3711,1.4327,2.5249,0.9279,1.4582,1.8573,3.5292,4.2604,1.033,3.35,0.9838,2.4213,1.8306,2.5067,3.1348,1.9311,1.4074,0.0002,4.3503,4.2,0.0007,4.5033,1.1275,8.6352,2.7448,5.395,3.7318,0.7575,3.9463,0.071,2.1797,1.6877,1.4423,0.381,0.6176,7.6676,1.6195,3.1434,6.1776,2.4502,1.3145,2.5203,0.6775,0.2668,0.6578,7.3523,1.5694,2.2279,1.6646,5.8914,2.0744,0.6605,5.5651,2.3661,5.39,3.1317,5.5457,3.8591,4.0057,0.0003,4.0203,4.3183,0.6496]}

I can be found with my head down lost in a story, usually with pencil and paper in hand.

I was very creative to say the least. I would be at the age of three making up my own stories with my sisters. I've always had a love of books and I remember begging for the Enid Blyton's Magic Tree House series. I was so excited to finally begin the series. I would read and re-read books with my sister. She was a few years older than me and she would let me join in the discussions and discussions of the stories.\n\nSo here we are. I just want to write, read, and create as long as I can.

{"id":126,"ended":false,"length":330,"text":"Earth has gained a new season, unlike anything currently known. [ WP ]\n\nThe second season of \" The Dark Knight Rises\" will be released in July, the studio Warner Bros. Pictures and director Christopher Nolan have announced. It will be released in conjunction with an event \" Batman Begins \" \u2013 celebrating the film, which was released in 2005 \u2013 with live performances and the opportunity to meet actors who were part of the trilogy.\n\nNolan directed the screenplay and starred in the film and the new film. The cast includes Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Miranda Otto and Marion Cotillard.\n\nThe previous work of Nolan was the 2005 \" Batman Begins \", his interpretation of the Batman character. It turned out to be a success and was the first film that focused on the main character of Gotham Gotham, the villain that is in most cases the Joker. The film was very expensive, but in the future it was able to obtain profits. The two films ended up being part of a trilogy of films that have earned billions and billions of dollars.\n\n\u201d the second part\n\nSo what is the third season? At this point, we do not know many things. Most likely it will be related to the Batman universe, it could take place in the past or in the future. It could even be a prequel to the \u201d Dark Knight \u201d, but for now there are only rumors and rumors.\n\nWhat will happen to the characters that we already know? Perhaps the Joker will return or the Penguin or perhaps in a completely different character. The possibilities are endless, and fans surely will be left on their feet by what awaits them in this new season.\n\nSource1","token_len":357,"entropy":[5.7157,7.651,1.6129,2.542,8.3408,1.8633,8.3927,4.5086,6.886,4.1629,1.3681,7.1022,13.8376,0.9811,0.7885,0.0222,2.4802,5.0466,0.8264,0.5789,2.7876,4.0682,5.35,1.2737,0.3149,0.0,2.4164,2.0687,1.8957,2.1694,1.9825,3.4503,2.1386,4.6598,4.718,10.4286,0.0421,0.2304,2.1891,4.4087,4.432,2.6867,0.0103,1.4391,0.8287,0.3091,2.9526,0.5669,1.2871,3.3234,1.7175,5.6328,0.006,3.8036,3.6458,4.5338,6.5996,1.8131,0.9305,5.8397,7.8114,0.7253,4.3603,6.3432,1.6149,2.4974,2.5044,0.9395,4.8479,2.7699,4.0148,5.5905,2.362,2.0955,4.0886,4.7254,0.2069,2.5514,4.475,3.3847,2.9343,2.3535,0.0273,0.4087,7.0629,0.6232,1.4091,0.0003,4.7535,0.0043,4.6576,0.5047,5.7858,1.7868,5.1084,0.6135,0.9929,1.5863,3.0366,2.5907,4.0696,2.1826,1.3155,1.7957,4.1088,0.7769,6.1235,0.016,0.5954,6.6424,0.0176,0.0006,0.1114,5.9758,0.0055,0.0,0.1406,4.3029,0.6037,0.1305,6.1125,0.0306,0.0141,0.0,0.0001,0.1697,7.431,0.9348,2.4063,7.5257,0.007,0.0,0.2616,1.0365,0.0002,1.5128,6.3016,7.1733,0.836,0.7276,1.8227,2.4151,5.3499,2.8442,3.9047,0.1646,3.3971,6.2673,9.6525,0.0227,0.5482,3.1398,3.1874,1.7143,2.9116,6.3531,0.1488,0.7064,0.0752,1.0445,4.3783,1.6135,2.7369,3.1125,1.3955,2.3834,2.7255,5.6087,0.2601,0.9663,4.7825,1.0085,1.8605,5.0515,9.8617,1.9102,2.5299,4.1513,3.3132,2.7771,4.2143,6.3322,3.5003,1.9972,2.6502,0.4727,2.0644,1.3196,1.6749,5.5085,7.0041,1.2208,1.9132,4.6925,1.3367,6.1466,1.4529,2.1234,4.501,0.0012,6.643,8.7623,1.9133,2.3525,5.4039,1.7835,5.2957,0.3286,1.5948,4.4005,0.0233,1.4468,2.2982,2.7408,1.1772,1.6688,4.2712,5.9425,5.3609,3.1329,2.4152,0.2847,0.0285,0.921,0.8925,0.0002,9.9805,6.0892,7.465,3.5522,5.0043,5.2339,0.0002,7.0022,2.1351,1.825,1.0212,2.8326,2.09,2.0555,6.4574,1.2659,0.4162,0.8238,2.1458,3.5161,0.1925,0.1582,7.8023,2.3519,1.4527,5.2893,2.1157,2.3133,0.1753,0.5062,6.6744,0.0355,0.9198,3.5809,4.2923,1.3478,5.7007,3.94,5.0807,0.3887,0.6941,1.2084,4.0916,0.9847,2.4839,0.4373,0.2728,0.9374,2.4518,1.0757,3.2947,0.5338,1.3346,3.7382,0.0133,0.7193,0.5661,15.3503,0.4396,4.958,0.0187,7.0267,0.0757,3.3147,2.8349,3.1627,0.1044,3.7642,1.3434,3.9786,2.9415,2.3303,2.5482,2.2522,0.8934,0.0002,3.7952,3.3835,1.8171,1.874,0.9111,2.818,3.2143,3.5334,3.2495,0.0993,1.6158,5.4601,2.1558,2.2922,0.932,1.7537,3.5502,2.1642,4.1256,4.0665,3.794,5.9292,2.3847,5.0484,0.207,4.0782,1.0331,2.5223,4.9335,0.328,0.5095,1.9303,2.1428,5.8671,8.9401,1.3995,1.3895,4.8437,6.0872,0.1689,1.4996,4.5696,3.9505,7.0396,0.888,1.8591,2.043,1.5098,2.0811,0.2049,0.5821,0.0003,4.1756,8.7979]}
{"id":1787,"ended":true,"length":332,"text":"You are the sole author of a popular conspiracy blog. Lately, your blog has been publishing posts without you. You have noticed that some of your posts have gotten more than a few comments. You find that the replies are full of spelling and grammar mistakes, as well as in-your-face obscenities. Do your posts have hidden code which makes those replies possible?\n\nMaybe. But if they do, why are they using those answers, and, more importantly, why are those replies written by somebody else?\n\nYou are also aware of a few \"shill\" accusations popping up from time to time in your blog comments. Your readers seem to have had the opposite experience and were surprised to read a few very strong accusations, usually accompanied by some weird accusations as well. Again, why would those shills respond to a post from somebody else?\n\nYes, but I don't know the answer, and that is why I am asking you.\n\nI have been working closely with Dr. David Icke and we have been investigating the \"Dark Agenda\" for years now. A series of posts, some I wrote but some he did ( he always gets ahead of me ) about what we know so far about the Dark Agenda, went up tonight in my blog. Most of his material is taken from interviews we did before he went to South America. Here is a link to those posts: Dark Agenda - Dr. David Icke.\n\nIn this interview, I will tell you what we do know so far, and what surprises I still have yet to uncover. David Icke has a lot to say about this topic.

{"id":4049,"ended":true,"length":326,"text":"At World's End' - A History of the Battle of Trafalgar\nThe Victory was one of the most important naval exploits in the history of the Age of Sail. It also had a decisive political effect on Europe and the rest of the world. In 1805 Napoleon Bonaparte lost the greatest challenge to the dominance of Great Britain since the English victory at Trafalgar in 1587. Trafalgar and its sequel inspired the development of new strategic technologies and naval tactics, which were crucial in two pivotal historical experiences \u2013 the U.K.'s victory over the French fleet at the Battle of Nelson in 1805 and the British defeat at Copenhagen in 1809 \u2013 marking the end of the age of sail.\nThis documentary focuses on the development of naval technologies and tactics, as revealed by the Battle of Trafalgar.\nIt begins with the defeat of the French fleet at the Battle of Toulon in 1797 by a combined British and Spanish fleet, with the use of advanced sail, rigging and cannon technologies. The second half of the documentary examines the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1800, where the British used the latest in naval technologies, the ram, to sink the French fleet.\nIn addition to an introduction to the background to the Battle at Cape St Vincent by Captain JT Brown of the RN's Challenger, this documentary also discusses the naval technologies and tactics used by the French, Spanish and British fleets in battle. It shows how Napoleon had to make radical changes to the design and capabilities of the French fleet to give it the capabilities to pose a credible threat to the British fleet. In the wake of the victory at Trafalgar, British naval technology was also developed, including the development of heavier-than-air aircraft, which would revolutionise aviation.","token_len":358,"entropy":[8.4816,1.8556,2.1717,6.5607,4.1402,4.1758,5.3053,0.2163,1.6713,5.4267,0.247,6.6405,0.3095,0.0,1.5914,6.7366,8.429,5.6584,4.7975,0.1166,0.5029,1.0942,1.7406,4.8482,9.0426,1.8564,1.0189,1.1477,0.0014,0.6067,7.9362,0.0213,1.4381,0.6429,1.8086,4.6342,4.5323,1.3118,3.6118,5.6818,2.0629,1.0893,4.8151,2.1338,1.5916,4.1754,0.0026,0.1185,0.3163,0.3276,2.9822,2.9576,4.6736,4.9916,3.1778,0.0006,0.0018,5.9796,1.1961,8.4598,7.3968,0.9559,1.2846,7.4789,0.0293,5.6603,0.0007,3.0979,0.6384,3.7952,4.1227,0.6207,5.4703,0.0025,0.0002,0.982,3.0796,4.5869,0.203,7.1119,0.0158,0.0003,3.9482,1.9885,9.1799,9.7174,1.3587,4.0456,0.0372,4.7628,4.6283,5.2057,1.463,3.8223,3.0303,2.0754,2.2966,2.3846,4.1453,1.1892,8.0904,4.3224,5.5224,7.769,5.0909,0.4772,7.2299,1.0324,3.1712,1.6639,0.0009,2.7692,1.9822,1.112,1.5874,5.9394,1.1052,1.585,0.036,0.0007,9.6976,0.9342,1.152,3.2255,0.1709,0.2928,2.4515,1.5086,0.5253,8.3089,0.2038,0.3613,2.421,4.6513,6.5786,0.3374,2.484,0.0179,0.529,4.8041,0.0654,2.9129,0.2968,0.9134,4.1111,6.1997,3.9546,0.1076,0.5047,4.6357,0.1761,2.9672,2.5924,1.3907,1.677,2.2087,2.5196,6.6319,0.9988,1.0177,3.8096,0.051,0.4771,0.0006,0.0002,1.1911,1.8745,4.119,4.3797,0.4464,1.1586,4.8793,0.1409,0.7811,1.145,0.3938,0.6269,1.6813,0.0623,0.0016,6.3424,0.4896,2.0358,0.5674,2.2151,4.5747,4.2784,2.1272,4.9058,3.0131,0.5092,4.0408,1.8361,2.1416,2.7156,1.0133,5.6242,0.0328,4.1351,6.9349,3.4788,6.661,0.648,5.1351,6.9541,0.4523,1.595,5.0011,3.5994,0.1062,0.1554,2.2224,2.4398,0.3924,4.9964,0.2522,5.6384,4.6733,5.4317,1.0235,5.4461,1.0754,3.1213,1.238,1.1027,4.8316,2.8494,4.4171,3.1807,1.9395,2.0854,1.7548,3.1648,9.2086,2.5255,1.4341,4.904,0.7853,1.0782,0.7148,0.6918,1.1083,2.7356,3.9979,0.5484,5.7385,2.7751,1.2115,0.83,8.7982,2.4941,0.5122,1.3793,5.0389,1.5045,0.0434,0.0148,5.042,4.2219,5.0104,7.1304,5.2127,3.1655,0.49,7.4041,2.8787,9.8789,1.3444,1.5616,1.0251,1.4678,3.8882,0.4762,4.3794,3.7231,1.5552,0.3408,1.9023,0.9513,0.4099,2.8303,2.9478,6.6613,0.2068,0.9193,2.0109,1.7743,4.6945,1.0796,2.364,3.848,0.9208,7.3253,3.4998,2.8245,4.1281,6.3562,0.4586,0.8036,1.0743,4.7145,1.7102,5.626,0.0461,0.9167,3.709,0.8448,1.8982,5.4707,2.25,0.9451,4.4275,1.1466,8.4259,0.6623,5.112,0.1821,0.4731,0.7601,1.3097,1.3813,0.7002,3.5366,1.7086,5.8855,0.0013,0.4859,3.9722,1.2295,1.243,0.0004,0.0004,0.309,3.2909,1.9789,2.4353,1.5361,4.1439,2.5542,1.8327,2.7977,1.2905,4.188,0.0247,8.1512,3.9715,0.3437,0.0012,0.0876,3.4595,1.0759,2.6357,3.5408,6.2094,0.8135,4.4924,0.8986]}

Under the influence of the cyclonic circulation and the low-pressure area, widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls and thunderstorms and lightning are very likely over Gangetic West Bengal & northeastern Odisha on May 7,\" the IMD said.","token_len":360,"entropy":[9.1131,2.7369,9.5003,3.5169,4.349,11.1873,4.2409,6.4926,3.7604,2.6359,1.9335,9.096,1.4813,3.4084,3.1891,0.1645,0.7658,10.8453,6.6303,8.839,4.9198,1.9774,5.8601,0.0162,4.8781,0.0669,5.602,2.2085,3.9812,4.9168,5.609,5.4791,11.1904,3.6708,1.5339,6.984,2.8925,3.4897,1.2431,0.9756,2.8111,11.9893,0.7162,5.4561,0.1012,3.1502,0.9193,2.013,12.0142,1.9011,4.1635,2.6209,4.3498,3.2065,6.3603,1.0247,2.1888,5.6975,7.4776,0.0921,0.7502,0.8459,3.7067,0.0814,2.3105,0.4587,3.0051,9.5332,1.2466,2.1805,8.7673,0.1121,0.4524,10.2523,1.9729,3.534,5.112,0.0178,4.3893,1.2295,0.1073,0.7158,0.983,5.3987,2.2988,3.9822,4.1305,1.0931,8.3382,1.093,3.7886,2.644,7.7952,0.1422,0.0032,0.9505,6.6962,6.9175,0.635,0.522,6.8173,4.4113,3.7352,3.3666,0.6379,3.5759,0.0106,1.7945,10.0758,9.1249,6.8284,5.6084,2.2932,4.2654,0.2472,4.9864,3.2804,0.9701,6.5756,6.9285,2.7487,6.3115,5.7376,0.0403,14.155,1.6257,4.3827,2.3718,0.071,6.9318,0.0352,0.0003,5.3876,1.5516,2.0058,0.122,1.7439,0.6079,7.6726,0.0354,6.7972,3.0455,0.7098,5.0598,0.0035,0.3457,0.012,1.2878,2.273,0.4656,3.5849,3.6399,6.2382,0.896,0.3146,0.018,0.7876,6.4084,0.0256,1.9174,3.9348,0.0158,3.0071,0.2096,1.3904,5.7202,0.4373,3.3513,0.4518,6.0243,0.1335,4.0558,2.7887,7.1135,2.4152,5.3425,0.5853,2.4214,7.8459,0.2515,10.4197,2.9541,0.0093,4.5941,4.8378,1.4271,3.3012,5.3134,6.8529,1.6206,4.9313,0.395,3.3437,0.4509,0.224,1.8418,7.1714,2.2941,2.7073,2.3768,2.3105,6.4291,7.1429,2.6786,6.142,7.052,4.2674,2.9287,3.667,6.5347,3.4832,1.5539,2.4564,1.2681,0.049,9.4086,5.6151,7.2301,3.991,1.0132,1.7686,0.4329,11.9419,0.6079,4.2904,1.5981,6.8639,6.5256,3.406,1.4598,3.9265,0.1732,2.9035,4.4763,7.9671,3.4244,10.743,1.0775,1.7801,1.8762,0.1791,2.0999,0.0676,1.0349,3.4308,5.4219,8.2806,1.9252,9.4901,2.3079,4.2467,2.1351,0.4979,5.6538,2.1225,5.9909,2.0905,5.6655,10.4448,4.7656,4.9254,5.8831,4.1366,6.5,1.7608,13.9126,6.8009,8.5087,1.9059,0.4459,0.5242,1.031,6.2474,1.4864,6.1016,5.1663,0.0922,0.0021,1.7032,5.4825,6.7224,4.2125,0.0071,0.0178,1.1735,3.6226,5.1047,2.3394,2.176,4.8608,1.4907,2.701,4.0876,1.7157,10.0864,3.3405,7.9931,2.9651,7.2539,6.2029,4.7674,0.0006,5.3774,0.6776,2.4169,4.7228,0.1552,0.4721,4.6412,6.9514,3.0239,0.9399,7.2379,1.8121,3.3248,0.0153,1.7288,1.9621,0.0838,0.2529,3.4032,1.4649,3.7693,0.7288,0.1771,1.3,0.5558,6.4662,2.2606,5.8496,6.0385,6.521,6.8309,2.4237,1.9363,0.1519,4.5611,1.5805,2.1457,7.8235,0.5155,3.298,7.4302,0.008,0.4312,0.0221,1.5795,3.0691,0.0465,0.002,2.6563,0.2759,1.6432,3.838,3.792,1.9944,0.0225,1.4586,0.5618]}

This is the auditory hallucination that you're having. You can't hear much if you're looking in the mirror. There are no sounds coming from your room because the mirrors are inaudible. That means you won't hear any sounds from your room unless the mirror is directly in your line of sight. The mirror will reflect and send a light to your eye to form your visual field. This is one of the reasons why you can't hear anything. Most people can't hear auditory hallucinations.\n\nYou also said that your auditory hallucinations are the worst if you're sleeping in a strange bed. How do you know what strange bed you slept in? I would assume that you've slept in a variety of beds because you've lived in different places. You haven't noticed this but your auditory hallucinations and your sense of hearing in general has gotten worse and worse. You just learned this the hard way.\n\nIf you've moved to a different place, you must have tried to adjust to your new environment. This is why your auditory hallucinations become worse and worse... because your brains haven't adjusted to the unfamiliar sounds. When your body is comfortable, most people' ears work normally.

{"id":4295,"ended":true,"length":331,"text":"Some time ago you wrote a short ghost story. Now, it's become an accepted truth and you've decided to come clean...\n\nThe book is a collection of short stories, most of them based around \"The Devil and Daniel Webster.\" It will feature stories by Stephen King, Joe Hill, Shirley Jackson, Peter Straub and others. But there are also some original short stories by the author.\n\nAny particular favorite among them?\n\nI like \"What She Said.\"\n\nWhat was your hardest writing job to date?\n\n\"House of Leaves,\" because it was so long and hard to write.\n\nSo the book is out on June 12th. What else are you working on? Any more short ghost stories?\n\nYes, I have some more in the back of my mind \u2014 \"The House of Pomegranates\" and \"The House of Lilliput\"\u2014 but I'd rather focus on novel-length projects right now.\n\nAs a writer, what are your secrets? I've been known to ask aspiring authors where they get their ideas for their books.\n\nI have lots of ideas, but some of them fizzle if the work isn't done right. A writer's job is to work the idea until it's in as good shape as you can get it\u2014to polish it. If it's a really good idea, it will write itself. But if you neglect it long enough, your idea will die.\n\nWhat advice for young writers would you give?\n\n\"It's important to sit down and write every day, but not in order to get any more done.\" That helps me a lot. I don't always accomplish what I set out to do, but at least I keep at it.","token_len":361,"entropy":[6.2157,2.4403,4.8262,4.2786,1.7853,4.578,11.4253,0.1776,2.9356,2.5072,1.9164,2.3454,0.5518,4.2065,2.7731,4.91,5.3489,3.2739,1.7003,2.0451,3.3171,0.3313,5.7087,2.7289,6.0591,2.2028,0.0878,3.2783,4.7033,1.4063,2.3777,3.6379,0.0178,2.6976,0.226,2.276,4.9031,0.2081,1.0382,4.8157,2.0237,6.104,3.3656,4.7325,3.4617,9.4479,4.4552,1.9133,2.9547,4.6436,4.2759,2.9246,2.5829,5.6976,0.9299,0.3184,5.1624,5.0753,0.3899,6.629,1.9445,0.2364,5.0449,5.0925,0.7517,1.7424,2.1728,0.4519,5.6841,3.2345,1.0645,1.4588,2.1909,5.0735,3.5149,0.0395,2.9738,3.508,3.3906,1.7887,1.2468,0.0003,7.1507,6.9123,5.1649,6.6612,2.2376,0.5895,0.6599,0.0002,2.5171,3.0193,4.358,6.0609,7.2955,1.6947,3.0519,2.2541,0.0002,2.3453,2.741,1.0063,8.0749,3.5656,3.5775,3.0357,1.8919,0.0947,0.0869,0.0002,4.0648,7.7856,0.4969,2.9188,2.2908,5.5048,1.3546,0.9853,1.9554,3.7234,1.4466,2.7751,1.0405,0.67,0.8538,1.3049,0.0002,4.6432,4.2284,3.0246,1.1701,5.0997,3.5692,3.4616,3.3751,1.4996,1.0296,2.1615,4.7053,1.9555,0.0298,1.2966,0.0067,0.5773,6.4796,3.9862,3.9289,11.4119,0.038,0.4945,0.2322,0.0002,5.0027,0.4561,1.4535,2.6971,2.6967,2.9512,4.3099,0.4648,5.4796,0.726,0.0813,0.9756,7.2606,3.3375,1.6572,5.4737,0.2895,6.994,7.6532,0.0241,0.095,1.039,1.0781,0.3503,1.2492,3.413,0.1769,5.7486,4.3745,0.728,0.0394,5.561,1.799,0.9733,4.5639,2.3298,3.8411,0.0708,7.4828,3.5754,0.4349,5.1804,5.5866,0.0215,0.3069,0.7128,0.0002,5.0389,2.1887,1.9571,0.3714,1.0118,2.1267,0.9836,5.0327,0.5542,5.0095,2.0772,1.9108,4.5962,0.0694,3.9586,10.6093,2.5876,5.0375,0.5044,3.3194,0.2472,2.1747,2.0451,2.3498,2.4689,0.7876,1.2627,0.0002,1.2709,3.1752,5.1883,0.0633,2.5353,1.542,0.9243,4.5519,1.1277,0.2606,9.3642,1.2055,7.5933,3.8369,4.9349,1.8055,0.0003,1.7768,3.0642,0.3033,4.5908,5.0557,2.2557,3.3001,0.2747,0.1249,4.3487,4.1566,3.6139,5.8872,1.123,1.2866,3.7545,8.5846,0.6963,1.7542,0.0205,4.5992,0.1435,1.5532,0.2731,6.0976,3.6594,6.1302,0.6835,3.0196,3.1995,1.8099,0.9267,2.7416,4.3932,0.7723,0.3961,0.2867,1.9504,2.5639,7.2652,1.2643,1.5105,2.8016,1.115,1.9374,8.7745,1.242,6.8764,0.0136,0.2299,4.1578,2.568,0.8311,3.5388,0.5852,0.8727,0.0001,2.0374,3.6282,6.5831,3.5534,0.3977,4.7002,0.0603,0.1152,2.7095,0.2844,0.0002,4.4673,4.2495,0.3602,3.6294,0.2463,6.6256,0.4965,0.6707,1.3526,5.3332,0.6796,1.6464,2.3963,3.8619,4.4208,4.4842,0.0345,2.3156,4.6246,2.5746,3.6092,1.0643,4.042,5.6751,4.6642,3.7015,0.1386,0.6608,1.8449,2.6775,0.0005,4.3342,8.4871,1.8982,0.0568,1.6353,0.0499,0.0146,0.4594,1.0638,0.4841,4.194,0.6723,0.6157,4.0204,4.9111,0.3112,0.3645]}

Then I'd have to go and look in the dictionary, and I'm like :o I got this word. I'd read it over and over in my head... ( she laughs ) I just keep going and it just keeps getting better.

Pick one person and describe what they see.\nI don't think I want to know. Not sure a cure can be \"partially\" cured.\nCuring doesnt mean stopping, it means stopping progression.. The problem with mental illness is it progresses at an exponential rate,  for those with mild it would never get too bad but the extreme cases can be horrific and sometimes fatal,  people in the early stages of schizophrenia can have a normal life if they are treated\nAnd once you catch it? There's no cure as such.\nThere are things you can do to try and prevent it but there will be certain events in your life that will set it off to a certain degree. I would be very surprised if schizophrenia is a \"cure\", but a \"stopping the progress\" or more realistic version\nWouldn't the stop the progress part be the same as a cure?\nAs in stop it from progressing rapidly.  I dont think anyone has a cure for a long standing illness where there are treatments that slow it down for some people and work for some people.  It\u2019s still a long ways off and will probably never be a cure, but progress can be made as long as more and more people are screened.\nIf it's a long ways off then maybe there's not any cure.

{"id":2660,"ended":true,"length":323,"text":"An alternate universe where Homo sapiens were not the only species of the Homo genus to survive to current time, and evolved on the Moon. The first recorded lunar inhabitants were a tribe of \"Moon-men\" who were enslaved, and later evolved into the \"Moon-People\", with the Moon eventually becoming their \"home.\" A later tribe of \"Moon-humans\" had lost their memories and came to be called \"Moon-Slaves\" after being enslaved in the lunar mines.\n\nThe Moon-Slaves were originally called \"Moon Man\" and were often enslaved by the Moonies. They only knew of the outside world from reading comics.\n\nOne slave, named \"Nemo\", escapes to Earth. He later remembers he lived on the Moon all his life, and that he was known as the \"Moon Man\". He also recalls the \"Moon Slaves\" had been in constant battle with the Moon-people and was in love with one of the Moonie soldiers.[1]\n\nThe Moonies were known to have a colony on the moon. The Moon people lived in huge mines below the moon. The Moon slaves were the ones tasked with mining the Moon, as well as working in the factories where Moonie technology was developed. The Moon people tended to be more intelligent than the Moonies.\n\nAt the Moonies' request, the Moon Slaves built a space station on the surface of the moon known as \u201cMoon Base One\u201d. During the war the Space Cadets fought with the Moonies, at one point the Moon-people and Moon-slavers battled the Space Cadets and in the end the Moonies were victorious and the Moon-people were enslaved. They were able to escape after the first moon base was destroyed so many years ago.","token_len":364,"entropy":[10.1396,4.2322,1.9358,10.7739,0.4487,0.0021,3.0675,3.0969,3.2187,1.7438,1.0749,3.1126,4.0064,3.129,1.0319,2.9818,3.2029,5.0898,7.66,3.283,2.0798,2.503,5.861,4.4846,1.636,5.9912,1.4774,2.5852,3.3505,3.5321,6.6118,5.6982,1.0815,2.9675,6.1179,0.2135,4.9494,4.9065,2.6431,4.1024,0.6978,1.267,2.245,5.9331,3.8209,2.0536,2.6228,4.3235,0.9277,1.6785,2.672,1.8937,0.7959,5.479,2.1314,4.184,1.5591,1.618,6.2282,1.098,2.3683,3.6773,2.6925,3.0763,4.3245,3.522,5.7751,1.0022,0.9418,0.5832,0.1013,5.2433,0.0964,4.5721,7.0522,0.6832,5.4276,1.2555,4.9867,0.3915,2.046,1.1737,0.7375,0.909,0.2974,5.9884,0.1297,1.522,3.5706,3.0842,1.6616,3.281,0.8714,2.6759,3.0581,0.7231,1.2729,0.0017,1.8211,1.6774,1.8774,2.6976,0.1746,1.4525,3.9957,3.719,0.8114,1.2952,5.3712,1.0529,2.0136,1.7169,4.8611,5.4084,1.2566,1.4424,0.9309,7.908,1.1493,2.1051,6.5406,5.3141,0.9062,1.0867,8.5878,0.0809,3.1779,6.5001,7.0425,1.8965,1.6873,0.0002,4.5216,8.242,2.3531,2.9081,1.5003,4.6332,5.2026,0.7772,9.4015,2.3173,1.3866,2.946,1.3355,4.1832,7.0782,4.3216,6.2677,1.6763,0.7204,0.3777,6.3876,0.4408,0.0278,1.1321,1.1239,2.4167,0.6891,1.4937,6.7472,1.161,1.9292,0.4534,0.6469,0.6599,1.0214,1.599,3.0316,4.5236,3.021,3.3014,0.8372,5.7769,0.2849,0.2749,5.6521,2.3357,3.6381,5.3048,4.5579,0.3906,0.8211,1.3006,3.5712,2.4123,2.7945,5.6195,4.686,3.634,0.0787,3.5704,0.6747,1.5867,0.4627,5.027,4.9276,4.8518,1.8128,0.0788,0.3815,0.0002,1.9649,0.6688,3.4614,1.8838,3.9746,0.9959,1.4357,2.7144,6.2765,1.0378,0.9107,1.9471,1.9179,2.0702,1.1992,3.8378,4.0035,1.19,6.1222,6.9807,6.3406,0.5435,2.1707,1.5281,1.4893,0.6964,5.2724,1.4082,4.1173,3.7801,6.5852,0.1462,3.097,0.7405,1.6571,2.3761,3.6804,0.941,0.0096,4.115,2.4991,0.7035,6.3842,3.5485,3.8188,4.0193,4.8599,0.387,1.582,0.3101,1.4546,0.3148,1.3846,6.1064,0.1276,1.3703,3.196,3.4089,0.7282,0.6204,0.6478,0.9634,2.0256,1.3515,0.0002,5.0085,1.7625,3.7925,3.2497,0.4279,3.7822,0.1031,0.8427,0.4455,4.6977,0.0641,3.5691,0.6207,5.8185,0.4931,1.9935,0.5366,3.1022,0.2645,0.1078,1.075,5.2171,0.0176,13.6315,7.1671,3.1678,4.9457,7.174,3.0365,7.1826,1.0275,4.0011,0.7001,2.9494,3.8924,6.061,6.2816,0.4385,4.8931,2.8768,0.3462,0.2861,0.8441,1.3955,6.4861,1.6658,0.0406,2.8187,0.7783,2.5711,1.2291,4.9185,2.1826,1.4475,4.753,2.6933,0.3761,4.915,3.8255,1.0195,0.1081,0.0052,2.4245,5.9193,0.9136,0.3623,1.3288,0.986,1.7882,1.7289,2.1329,3.2512,1.2351,1.4482,1.0554,1.3484,1.2822,4.9395,0.9636,4.0663,1.2498,3.9059,0.0063,1.8344,4.4416,1.0871,5.5477,2.9879,5.7459,0.6997,1.0317,6.3732,4.8773,1.6828,1.2377,0.8591]}

But the European directive, which Wilders helped draft, would extend such protection to search engines such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter for European citizens.\n\nIt would also impose criminal penalties on search engines that do not remove web links within a designated time frame.\n\nThere has been a strong backlash to the proposed EU directive since it was first proposed.\n\nGoogle, Facebook, and Twitter have said that the rules could have unintended negative legal consequences, such as a chilling effect on freedom of expression.","token_len":366,"entropy":[7.0671,4.1051,0.0019,1.7031,3.7488,2.4105,0.7165,3.4671,7.4844,1.0387,7.6159,1.8224,0.0162,3.5175,9.0768,2.0473,2.8646,5.3261,0.0287,8.8887,3.1576,2.4243,0.7994,3.5894,5.1444,3.0828,6.8621,3.442,4.9379,2.3491,0.0096,0.9021,2.5698,0.6354,6.2605,6.5571,1.7779,0.9685,3.192,6.1901,8.0311,1.0699,7.094,2.8506,5.2891,0.1983,0.7626,2.8482,2.7592,1.0687,5.3812,2.4542,1.2539,2.1469,0.1335,0.2488,0.0004,3.4848,0.8836,3.0158,3.9617,0.3087,2.672,0.5584,0.793,3.9833,2.7483,0.5168,7.7202,0.1549,5.0988,0.0025,7.074,3.4043,2.3693,5.1659,7.4443,1.2783,3.9984,0.7582,1.2218,4.2067,2.0682,2.7221,3.6683,3.1026,0.2096,1.2895,1.8657,5.9534,7.7293,3.8622,5.4645,3.406,7.8305,3.1523,1.5429,0.5712,2.257,1.3839,0.3535,0.0003,1.4459,4.2966,3.4871,2.8739,0.6835,5.5494,0.5515,4.1086,0.2016,0.0257,0.0002,2.2367,0.0558,3.469,0.0103,1.055,2.7204,6.105,2.2037,0.0006,0.2472,3.3035,4.6407,3.3593,3.7926,2.5135,1.3454,0.8603,1.9726,1.3552,0.0005,1.4973,0.1794,0.2594,0.7757,0.0002,6.0728,0.0076,1.6547,1.4556,5.9601,3.8195,0.1766,5.0592,8.8022,1.0907,1.6234,1.7613,0.3195,4.7267,0.7338,1.1842,2.1626,1.088,5.1895,3.346,1.7755,9.1625,0.2778,11.9802,3.4509,0.4249,1.079,0.5631,3.6231,5.358,0.8062,5.7098,4.0089,2.7656,1.8578,2.6185,5.205,7.3101,0.7182,4.2527,0.2944,4.6107,3.1913,1.561,2.1483,0.2129,0.0002,1.6669,3.2581,7.0425,3.2523,4.1986,2.1914,0.3619,4.4973,0.9499,5.5635,3.5233,6.1717,0.9646,1.1379,0.0034,0.1889,5.0837,2.8321,5.7517,0.06,4.3689,6.0379,0.4281,5.1149,7.3724,6.506,4.5719,1.6967,5.5946,3.4265,0.4913,0.0738,4.0228,3.1931,1.3607,3.9575,2.8838,0.9682,0.0023,5.79,0.5264,1.8242,6.1752,2.6981,0.8956,2.4395,6.8207,4.0958,0.008,0.3128,0.2446,0.0002,1.5387,6.4107,0.0012,0.9477,0.3427,2.0721,4.522,0.9501,1.8856,2.9978,1.3916,0.28,0.3595,0.0059,0.1174,4.527,4.7373,4.3646,2.0369,1.8389,3.8257,7.2042,1.8165,2.4444,7.2221,1.1676,3.0927,1.4731,2.1828,7.9144,2.9642,0.9263,10.4391,0.0029,5.3327,2.0375,0.3129,2.348,5.0916,3.6351,3.8063,0.1472,5.3092,1.3137,2.4815,0.0008,0.1216,1.0304,1.5558,1.1937,1.7502,1.3684,5.6771,7.0741,2.4887,0.8857,0.1436,0.0002,4.5831,1.5385,0.8437,4.9176,6.1952,0.3762,0.6819,4.8847,0.358,0.7335,2.4986,0.0958,3.5388,4.3874,3.6955,5.6556,2.0598,5.3776,1.341,0.4418,0.8108,0.3736,0.0002,5.6154,2.604,0.2107,1.7883,4.1091,2.1601,1.8527,0.3695,2.0967,4.4289,3.0988,3.6855,0.8403,0.3179,1.3136,1.7318,2.3593,1.274,0.0002,5.6461,1.5709,1.7844,0.5201,0.4425,0.2368,1.1176,2.1103,1.6962,1.5819,2.6445,3.0839,3.6165,4.1704,3.2599,7.8633,0.283,1.4757,2.5285,0.0049,4.5713,4.4516,0.0313,0.068,2.9968,0.013,0.5082,1.0196]}

{"id":189,"ended":true,"length":337,"text":"Scientists correctly guessed when a massive solar flare would reach Earth but they were wrong on what would happen once it got here.\n\nThe flare reached Earth yesterday, April 23, at a magnitude 9 -- roughly the equivalent of a large atomic bomb, according to a report from NOAA. It was predicted to hit during the peak of \"peak evening sky brightness\" on April 24, at 9 p.m. EDT local time.\n\nIn response, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Space Weather Prediction Center issued a space weather alert and called for people to stay indoors with their electronics shut off. But even NOAA officials were shocked by the solar storm's devastation.\n\n\"We've observed very little in the way of space weather to date in comparison to the 'average' sun spot cycle,\" said Dr. Frank Billmeier of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. \"It has definitely proven us all wrong.\"\n\nBillmeier and his team of prediction scientists had spent a month prepping for the flare. That includes modeling what would happen with the solar flares, with the geomagnetic storms, or disturbances in space weather, and with the Earth's magnetic fields.\n\nThe solar flare, called a coronal mass ejection, or CME, occurred yesterday evening. It was the same type of CME that destroyed a power system in New York in 2003, although this flare was not as strong. It's expected that another CME will hit the Earth today, and this could cause another solar storm.\n\nIt turns out those CMEs are huge, and NASA says their effects are a danger to the entire Solar System.\n\n\"The power produced by the eruption is expected to be comparable to a CME of the same size that happened in 2013,\" says NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.","token_len":367,"entropy":[10.0464,4.8235,5.0337,2.6505,6.9936,5.2642,0.9888,1.6325,4.748,0.2663,5.5406,2.8057,1.9145,1.4693,4.0768,3.8917,3.6517,0.2822,5.3075,0.829,4.4029,3.362,0.2482,1.0193,0.0005,2.1169,5.354,5.0808,0.7532,7.1949,1.6595,5.1676,3.3097,0.5541,2.8317,2.9594,3.8449,3.4207,12.49,4.9853,1.2073,4.4892,0.0827,1.1672,5.249,5.5787,0.2268,4.9579,1.3646,0.0017,3.3813,2.8033,1.5222,5.3611,0.557,2.7721,1.3178,5.7209,0.4482,2.1165,7.1609,0.9047,3.6116,0.3565,5.7458,3.5152,7.2937,4.5147,3.8132,0.6461,2.1454,0.7865,1.6726,1.1325,4.4467,3.4058,1.9195,0.0006,0.0005,0.2241,1.1789,6.397,0.0023,0.6002,0.4442,0.0002,4.1475,5.3142,0.7279,1.569,1.8393,1.172,0.0055,0.0024,0.0,0.0036,4.1574,1.0824,4.3407,0.0829,0.0094,0.0092,2.9205,0.5342,7.6055,0.4866,1.0084,4.1197,3.5338,0.5373,4.7561,0.3983,1.2354,0.6762,5.4936,2.4606,4.9115,4.6469,0.1873,0.7963,3.9893,4.2277,5.9508,1.5789,2.258,3.9691,1.5294,0.3647,4.1109,3.078,1.7882,6.4967,0.6897,0.3063,0.0002,0.51,2.1641,2.7481,5.6812,4.283,1.2588,3.8556,0.6288,2.2776,0.0042,7.3153,0.1995,5.149,0.9075,3.8663,4.2857,0.2336,1.2035,5.7506,5.0867,0.538,4.3676,8.8936,8.5797,1.0057,0.7121,4.8193,0.0264,5.3971,8.746,8.3975,2.4117,1.5367,0.2194,2.4308,0.0803,0.2701,0.0319,0.7139,0.5182,3.0626,3.8208,5.8339,7.2143,5.8415,5.6068,0.0434,0.9021,0.053,0.0002,3.0079,0.0423,2.2238,0.7741,1.6146,2.7025,11.2902,1.595,4.3902,5.1963,2.9942,2.7957,6.8835,0.2946,0.5854,0.6135,4.901,1.9408,4.92,4.1482,6.2348,3.4797,1.0103,0.1618,3.8128,0.8159,2.0616,3.5152,1.653,5.3284,1.8422,7.8431,1.1226,0.0033,2.3643,1.7747,4.9732,9.1102,2.2625,1.5792,1.9661,2.1806,1.8659,1.679,1.2248,3.4854,0.4446,1.3204,2.5614,0.5383,0.4703,0.0002,2.2317,3.6462,2.034,2.9792,3.9199,1.7549,3.6894,0.013,0.001,0.0025,0.0117,1.3001,1.7637,0.1625,0.0077,0.1034,5.6314,6.5441,3.6052,1.9314,1.7713,1.5187,1.9711,5.3367,2.4847,0.0327,4.5581,0.0145,0.6737,5.8186,2.2074,5.4948,5.3468,0.8786,3.9468,1.0864,2.1015,4.1111,1.2973,5.7978,3.3378,4.8831,1.5397,3.0878,1.9949,3.3378,1.0047,2.8693,3.1932,3.6762,5.5638,5.4117,1.0025,0.0072,1.6611,2.0139,1.3314,0.7992,4.4196,1.0397,2.5979,3.8316,3.4773,2.751,4.0933,2.4467,1.7499,1.284,0.3086,0.0002,4.3934,6.8322,0.0019,5.7667,2.9097,0.0086,0.6115,1.1938,6.2203,1.094,1.3664,6.6182,2.9348,4.2467,4.0019,1.04,5.3684,6.6396,0.5988,2.4538,3.2163,5.3131,0.03,0.3878,0.8505,0.0002,0.933,1.9353,6.7352,6.3872,0.2823,1.4444,6.9084,1.961,4.1322,0.0199,0.9853,5.6603,0.1112,2.4671,4.3209,0.3192,3.0073,1.8555,2.3862,0.7399,3.5148,5.9854,1.1396,4.5352,0.7614,3.4619,1.2939,0.9507,2.4349,0.2026,0.0006,0.0062,1.2938]}

Your friend will call your family and confess his crime.\n\nThe game features multiple endings to suit different tastes : some you can finish without completing the puzzles : others provide puzzles with alternative solutions : others are much more difficult.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nAdditional Info\n\nThe game is available in French, English and Japanese.\n\nA puzzle guide available in electronic format also allows you to obtain additional endings.\n\nThe game can be played using a game pad, keyboard, mouse and\/or a joystick.\n\nThe game includes :\n\n* Over 60 puzzles.* Four different endings : some you can finish in as few as five minutes (there are 2 different ways of completing the first puzzle : one gives almost all the answers without any puzzles : the other requires one extra puzzle ).* Three types of hint : use the game guide only if you want to finish immediately * High definition 3D graphics* Multiple modes : easy ( no puzzles), normal ( puzzles ), hard ( no puzzles ).* Optional sound.* Help and tutorial videos.","token_len":368,"entropy":[9.3297,2.0102,1.7937,5.3764,6.5662,2.7639,0.5,7.4119,0.1509,4.0741,0.73,1.1403,2.6678,2.4573,4.4258,1.133,5.1875,1.3978,8.8834,0.4262,0.7648,1.0466,0.9582,3.5487,2.9128,3.6927,10.4349,0.0097,1.4768,15.2425,9.6282,4.3979,2.5337,1.6728,4.328,1.5754,1.4084,2.7782,0.7888,4.9509,2.9764,1.9565,2.1391,3.2724,7.1336,0.2085,0.3717,0.0391,0.3514,3.1926,0.1084,2.5969,7.0915,0.2215,1.4627,2.356,0.292,0.4564,5.4832,3.3214,3.6295,3.2966,1.4718,6.3002,3.0278,0.4168,1.7637,0.2908,1.3174,4.7246,2.0618,1.7003,7.4795,0.7265,0.8291,3.9837,0.2962,0.1406,0.2346,5.4968,5.7585,4.3709,3.6775,5.498,8.4922,2.0076,0.0003,4.0286,1.2776,3.4302,2.7388,0.017,2.2639,3.7658,7.8187,2.2459,4.5976,5.0812,0.624,2.0958,1.8605,1.8493,1.9301,4.3932,6.794,0.7507,5.3664,6.9445,4.4128,2.4471,4.2349,3.4606,2.6379,1.6101,0.9049,4.4572,0.5793,1.4985,1.5106,1.0712,4.1231,2.576,3.1749,4.785,3.5518,1.1262,4.7765,0.9119,2.0011,1.4049,1.036,0.0003,3.1204,8.9471,3.035,1.5378,0.1663,5.9735,2.4642,7.2556,5.1867,0.8948,0.5231,1.7077,4.6356,1.9125,2.1235,1.7663,2.4762,0.2642,7.2261,1.4123,2.218,0.5029,2.1647,0.61,0.2971,4.6968,1.87,2.2044,5.4865,3.5049,6.1967,1.2618,7.796,2.1753,3.6439,0.7988,1.5461,0.0003,2.2092,1.5486,5.2323,4.469,1.2038,3.0006,7.6027,2.5799,4.7626,9.4179,4.5685,4.7277,1.8692,4.6381,4.439,4.9581,0.9183,3.3394,7.9622,1.8527,7.0264,5.2149,3.004,6.8733,4.3358,3.1804,3.3772,2.4915,5.7406,0.7299,1.275,2.2222,0.6964,0.0004,7.6657,2.9959,0.7181,0.0003,5.894,4.1068,1.4146,0.0003,2.6785,1.2058,1.4422,2.039,1.3891,4.6525,1.081,1.8604,2.7051,2.0784,0.646,0.982,0.0002,4.1207,6.7956,5.8462,5.2016,1.6349,10.514,1.2615,5.7268,4.4505,0.5543,0.0142,5.0886,2.7975,8.3091,1.0545,0.5661,0.0003,1.8698,0.8853,2.7479,0.4134,0.6642,3.3816,1.7652,3.8776,4.3241,1.8129,2.7213,0.7175,1.9774,2.4036,2.8739,0.0009,1.8603,4.4886,0.3467,0.7314,0.0002,1.6012,0.6653,4.1893,7.706,0.644,0.0005,4.9574,6.0613,3.698,1.2231,7.4988,7.8059,3.0014,1.0634,3.5358,5.1071,4.354,0.6095,1.4894,3.9094,6.1331,2.1539,0.4104,2.483,0.9542,3.2085,5.5695,0.6293,4.9996,3.2029,4.1174,2.1161,1.7055,1.2126,4.773,2.5807,3.2059,2.2242,7.2875,9.2518,2.0392,1.0261,2.3682,5.2861,2.6006,2.4484,5.6256,1.6035,0.5087,4.0736,4.4175,5.0945,0.387,4.3673,4.0766,3.5786,4.8255,0.0991,9.784,1.3857,7.968,1.5964,3.7736,6.5202,5.311,1.7969,0.3783,1.8017,0.335,3.4711,8.2376,5.9716,8.4915,6.3651,5.482,0.0845,1.3028,3.1063,4.4142,6.5397,1.4901,5.7893,3.5907,6.2836,3.3839,5.7723,6.7851,0.3872,3.8017,4.1189,2.6988,0.1889,4.5881,0.0333,2.4988,0.6144,5.3037,5.3947,5.6608,6.6259,3.5417,5.3536,4.9335,2.921]}

{"id":3975,"ended":true,"length":345,"text":"While searching the Papal archives to determine why God has been absent from man for so long, an old priest discovers that the Black Death of the middle ages was actually the Rapture.\n\nThe book is intended as a bit of humor, a kind of satire on the modernist world of the Vatican, while being a kind of an adventure story for anyone with an open mind who wants to be touched by something different.\n\nThe Pope, the Virgin Mary and many other icons of the Christian faith will appear in the story, though these are not the main characters.

If it is possible, we would like to have access to the twitch server and play with twitch and his viewers so that summit1g can reach the top positions of the earth in terms of twitch\"\n\nYou can imagine the backlash that the government and twitch would get if the alien said \"we are destroying your planet and enslaving the humans, and we need to gain access to your internet so we can enslave you too\"","token_len":369,"entropy":[9.7836,3.8833,2.461,5.8632,0.0169,3.8209,4.4801,4.328,0.1433,2.6996,0.0054,12.268,2.7147,11.2262,7.6373,1.2889,4.6999,6.3601,1.3383,11.7206,0.1451,0.0147,4.1021,1.6054,2.3387,2.3312,1.9923,7.8627,2.993,4.2099,4.556,3.0072,3.8621,0.8276,1.4228,0.0009,1.9617,1.998,3.9945,2.8841,0.2028,3.2919,0.9672,2.4767,2.9029,5.8932,0.0135,4.3333,5.7425,4.1201,7.071,0.004,5.2903,3.5173,4.5867,3.2663,1.0518,2.4645,0.9139,2.063,3.8428,0.1918,0.2217,4.3418,3.54,3.313,1.0616,2.9058,0.9092,5.3024,0.9271,3.1198,7.5467,7.763,0.1535,6.6933,8.9526,1.5671,6.3645,8.0344,1.6106,2.6753,2.1194,0.1338,0.0827,0.8979,1.8876,2.0787,0.2743,0.1239,3.5756,5.132,0.1838,4.0605,1.9895,4.403,1.609,3.2438,5.0739,0.5687,2.6345,5.6797,0.8736,5.0242,7.649,6.9264,5.5335,2.6399,4.505,3.0064,4.014,7.2908,3.0727,3.5966,5.8594,2.715,0.7942,3.2079,2.1368,6.5364,0.2174,5.0729,6.8591,1.6389,8.7172,13.2953,9.4946,6.178,5.5317,0.0003,5.1623,0.9,5.9541,6.0089,8.1273,0.5783,0.5949,4.8165,0.4126,1.0517,0.1799,0.0003,6.217,4.4254,5.4196,7.4812,1.2681,6.2195,3.4482,1.7207,3.3466,3.3293,1.7381,0.0003,3.3334,5.6273,3.5212,6.5163,1.1363,0.0513,5.8063,3.3245,2.9538,4.2457,8.8058,3.9643,1.7918,5.4567,3.3008,2.9248,3.4607,0.4657,5.6906,0.8573,0.5605,0.0002,2.5645,2.9223,3.2663,4.2794,10.5677,5.226,10.0709,1.2152,0.9398,0.0398,4.5057,0.2314,0.9038,4.6938,6.0318,0.0003,4.4966,8.0067,1.2963,1.76,1.9148,4.873,0.3895,4.1984,7.9989,5.0766,1.4917,3.7815,1.9167,6.4543,2.4512,5.3097,2.2481,4.4351,5.3607,1.4659,1.5544,3.8864,0.9898,2.7332,7.418,4.664,1.0373,5.4387,2.1151,1.9232,2.4258,6.1246,7.2115,1.9005,2.8007,1.3222,1.6028,5.7882,1.0849,4.3064,5.1859,2.1355,3.9828,3.6069,1.3748,6.3331,8.0458,0.9165,6.4417,0.3048,1.4485,0.62,3.811,6.267,0.9481,6.1452,3.2623,0.491,2.2825,4.0997,3.3873,5.9131,7.2169,3.5245,1.7809,1.902,4.3431,3.4237,7.4088,5.7581,2.2976,2.2695,5.6025,4.1323,3.458,0.7298,4.7134,3.6956,1.3216,1.0966,7.9618,1.0484,0.2329,5.9796,3.6116,4.0646,4.8215,4.6102,0.772,4.0403,4.6395,1.3269,2.3839,1.9615,1.2157,1.2467,0.5317,0.1238,1.5727,5.8924,0.0244,1.8886,2.6652,3.6882,1.6761,4.2853,0.7873,6.7123,4.26,4.7428,4.6456,3.7826,0.6002,9.5656,9.4727,1.4497,0.6278,2.7339,0.9409,3.5684,6.66,1.4101,0.9769,5.6562,6.8924,4.8438,0.0015,10.2148,7.1863,0.1617,0.0003,4.2286,0.3848,5.6552,1.3953,8.026,2.4546,2.3528,6.2499,2.3922,4.4905,2.0098,2.5129,1.3418,1.9766,1.4058,4.7799,2.5588,4.2239,1.6431,8.3938,1.988,2.2237,1.7279,5.467,0.003,2.6993,2.6079,3.488,2.0554,1.7153,3.2608,0.9022,6.8837,3.5314,0.0733,1.2143,2.8133,2.7313,1.7776,0.133,6.4015,0.0009,1.206,3.5242,1.4058]}
{"id":290,"ended":true,"length":356,"text":"It's Christmas time in the Commonwealth, and all across the wasteland parents are telling their kids the post-war tale of old Saint Nick. From the safety of their parents lap, children are told of a kind magical man in red, who drops off gifts, fills stockings, and leaves a sack on every family's doorstep full of presents. It's a tale they tell for years to come, and so begins the tradition of Santa Claus. But for Father, Santa is nothing more than a silly myth.\n\nThis is one of my favourite times and I enjoy playing Christmas songs and festive content. On top of this I always enjoy seeing what the dev teams from all of the big Fallout creators come up with for their own fan content. The teams don't just stop there though, some create their own mini games, some come up with their own characters, while others are much more traditional and do more than just simple customisation. If you enjoy seeing what else can be done this is a Christmas fan content community you will not want to miss out on.\n\nSo grab a hot cup of cocoa and let's take a look at what the creators themselves and their content have to offer.\n\nBethesda :\n\nSo let's start with where things start. Christmas, Santa Claus, and all things festive come under Bethesda Softworks, and that is where we head off. First up is Old Saint Nick himself. Not only being a creation of Todd Howard but of course developed and made by Bethesda, Santa Claus is of course a player created build. But to allow the player to complete that build the developers have included a base build of the character. The build comes in two pieces, the hat and legs. There are a few more extras that go along with this build also but first things first, let's look at Santa.","token_len":370,"entropy":[3.0338,9.3285,2.6139,3.3671,1.9986,7.5811,1.7068,1.0923,4.6692,6.5169,0.8546,9.35,11.2689,1.1041,5.1642,0.5594,1.1352,4.2538,8.1105,0.5688,6.4043,7.4413,0.1564,7.2191,10.67,5.2765,1.3933,5.7609,1.5161,8.3515,0.0382,0.8945,4.334,13.1935,1.12,4.3227,1.4183,3.9182,2.4451,2.9473,7.5742,7.8652,4.0162,3.7902,4.5266,2.1538,2.5302,8.3235,2.9593,3.5984,2.9442,7.245,8.0038,0.151,0.6654,0.708,4.8984,2.604,6.9952,3.7383,5.4999,4.0494,1.2239,0.5215,9.227,0.0046,2.8168,0.5007,3.2455,0.2995,1.438,2.7525,4.0425,4.1191,4.0626,3.1086,0.952,0.004,1.1526,1.2041,5.1824,6.2407,0.888,5.1691,0.1724,3.1275,0.4272,1.5416,3.6508,3.8192,6.4561,5.1628,3.4274,1.3508,4.7379,1.1749,0.0259,0.4092,5.6333,5.2752,1.2504,1.4996,0.0012,3.9944,2.0261,3.829,0.3475,3.6223,2.1138,7.1806,6.2248,2.2223,6.817,4.2024,5.3756,4.5746,2.4348,6.8178,7.7567,1.7378,5.6705,3.9183,0.0031,2.6935,2.0562,4.8378,2.7847,4.2244,4.3568,2.2647,8.5091,4.8547,4.8244,3.4018,4.2897,0.8296,4.0369,9.1371,6.9934,4.9551,0.0049,0.0061,1.6808,1.6071,4.2669,5.461,4.7013,0.5253,3.4507,6.1095,6.5881,0.0024,1.6714,6.942,2.047,3.095,0.8464,4.761,6.9952,1.9514,0.007,5.6781,2.5991,2.0092,3.363,4.9874,0.9556,0.0149,1.5533,0.0032,4.3044,0.9603,6.8982,0.7324,3.079,6.4226,0.1829,4.9523,1.6833,4.8856,2.9446,2.4246,0.2508,6.8899,5.9689,1.22,0.7058,4.5227,0.3896,3.9102,5.7345,1.1847,7.098,5.2604,0.3017,0.7549,5.3372,2.0811,1.4422,7.0327,5.5822,4.0731,6.2456,2.7574,1.5396,3.4069,1.6843,0.0542,0.0048,1.7095,0.2557,0.2541,0.4686,0.0002,2.9245,6.3526,1.3568,6.1271,2.6075,0.1234,4.5953,0.7946,3.7561,0.4761,3.4152,0.5038,1.0653,0.2294,1.6736,2.6145,5.5631,6.6832,5.0657,1.1593,5.6287,2.5592,0.4405,1.0719,0.5667,0.4347,0.0001,6.4486,0.0785,6.9415,2.62,0.0001,5.326,4.0548,0.0705,1.4071,0.5576,7.0391,4.6802,1.8205,1.2613,9.2067,3.9626,6.9623,1.7209,0.6671,0.7218,2.923,3.3259,4.3128,3.382,5.1278,5.5932,6.0457,0.0009,3.2089,1.7489,3.3155,2.2485,3.1445,2.5359,7.049,4.353,1.9604,5.6662,1.9853,0.8684,6.7538,4.4768,0.3199,5.3364,1.0028,4.8282,0.7312,8.9213,1.1826,6.0085,0.2487,7.3731,0.3803,2.8998,5.2443,1.9165,8.7292,2.7299,3.6255,0.6796,1.0528,2.0928,5.6766,1.3585,0.6603,6.1106,0.8421,1.8209,6.1119,4.717,9.3073,1.4843,4.7599,4.2197,7.1357,2.4387,2.5625,0.3274,5.7127,4.7156,1.352,3.9345,2.2615,1.538,4.0084,1.0457,6.9049,2.3642,1.0584,1.346,3.2596,1.7159,2.5067,2.4705,4.189,2.3643,1.9269,5.0299,0.9835,1.2987,8.3208,0.5606,7.3152,1.0629,3.9327,0.7583,2.5252,1.2426,3.9681,5.7219,2.1288,5.2208,1.3709,0.1159,1.8621,1.218,8.151,3.2123,4.8023,3.5004,0.002,1.6487,2.2583,0.0855,1.9735,0.0366,5.7606,2.0378]}

It was great. The art styles were so different from each other. I was looking forward to this anime. It had the potential to be GREAT because the manga isn't that bad. That means they just threw away two seasons' worth of awesome.\n\nI wonder why this anime is so awful. I can understand the first one because the manga hadn't been completed. But what happend in the second? They left tons off anime. Most of the characters were left out. Why they didn't include the main characters or some of the characters who had their own storylines or even some of the side characters who have more than one episode. I would understand if they adapted a third or something but a second season, or even first series of the second season and they left major characters out and cut stories off. It could have been great.\n\nI just want them to stop making these stupid shows where people just make fun of the animes. Then we would have a better understanding of the anime. Like you guys already know stuff about this anime, right? Why cant they show it on television?!?!?!\n\nIt could have been great. They had to throw all the good story and cut the anime in half and the animation was crappy. And the characters were weird. Like, why were the main characters and the side characters fighting each other?

{"id":1864,"ended":false,"length":355,"text":"Begin your story with the line `` Does a lamp know it's a lamp? ''\n\nThe book is intended to be used as a first text for a college-level, introductory course on English Composition, while `` Does a Lamp Know It 'S a Lamp? '' can be used by an advanced reader to see how literature deals with the paradoxes of language. By the time the advanced reader reaches this second part, he or she will have seen enough to understand why and how the author uses and exploits paradox in his or her writing. In the following pages we shall encounter only a small number of paradoxes. The student will probably encounter more as he or she completes the course sequence. But to read just this first text--with all its ambiguities, paradoxes, and puzzles--is to read the very best writing in the English language, and to understand how much is lost by abandoning that rich and complex poetic source.\n\nAs you proceed in your exploration of language, I would ask you to ask yourself, where are paradoxes hiding? What other paradoxes have you encountered, and why did they give you pause and make you wonder how they could be resolved? Where exactly are you in the world, or in the universe, as opposed to the world of meaning that has grown up around you and that you take for granted almost daily? Are `` I know '' and `` I do '' actually expressing the same idea? Are `` this side of the street '' and `` that side of the street '' similar enough to mean the same thing? (See Chapter Five.)

When they investigate, much has changed on Earth. From primitive creatures on the Moon to alien life forms on Europa, much has been discovered. But the biggest surprise comes from a mysterious being who has come to Earth in time to save the world from an alien invasion. But now the beings on Earth are dying and the mystery man begins to find clues on the Golden Record which will lead him to the next great discovery on this planet.\n\nThe movie has received good reviews and I can imagine that there are not many who have not seen it. I only got to see if recently when i got home from a trip to Japan and Korea and was looking for movies as on the plane to and from the trips I saw The Karate Kid Again ( a must see ) and The Karate Kid Part II.\n\nI also read that there was a fan film made by a couple of guys in North Carolina and I watched it right away. They did a great job I would say and I was quite impressed with the movie. As for the other official movies well I have not seen and I have not even heard of the sequel the third movie\n\nSo what did I think? It certainly was a sci-fi movie and as in I said I enjoyed it. I would rate it a 7. I do not know the original Golden Record that was on the ship and therefore do not want to give spoilers. But I enjoyed this one. I only wish I could have seen more of the aliens on the film. On that note the movie was only a one time screenwriting experience since I do not think it has gotten a production yet.

{"id":3302,"ended":true,"length":352,"text":"Everyone ages based off of their birthday on the Gregorian calendar, leaving those who are born on leap day to age 4 times slower than everyone else, and those on the reverse to age 25 times faster than the average person.\n\nBecause the Gregorian calendar, which we used before we changed it back in 1976, adds an extra day on the same cycle each year, years on the Gregorian calendar are slightly different than the way we counted ages. If a leap year hasn't happened in a while, this is when our year starts and ends, but because we use the Gregorian calendar it can fall within a given year as well.\n\nSo in short, when we turn 100, that will be the average time it took us to age as much as all those who lived before us put together.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar was chosen because of its length. Since the ancient world had to adjust to the length of the seasons on the Julian calendar and because our number of years has remained unchanged, our calendar has been more closely aligned with nature than other calendars.\n\nThis also means that any leap year can fall or winterize our year - sometimes happening and sometimes not. So if you happen to be born in February or October, it will be your birthday that year, regardless of whether February or October is a leap year.\n\nBecause it takes more years before it takes you 25 years to age, you can't really die on a February 23rd or December 7th. This is because this happens when your body is older than most people living today.\n\nYou're also probably born on the same day (or close to the same day) every year, despite what the world says. If you didn't have birthdays you could theoretically go on living forever (though you'd have to skip many years of your life).","token_len":372,"entropy":[10.7903,12.3223,5.0275,0.8923,2.2155,6.6298,5.8927,1.5295,9.5777,0.0525,0.1692,1.8427,9.0494,5.6423,1.2847,1.262,3.4914,2.0181,10.5597,3.337,1.3661,5.2871,4.8514,8.0755,6.1933,0.7871,4.404,0.1706,2.5158,1.9952,3.1543,5.6497,1.9452,7.9353,6.178,0.1375,5.1751,1.2972,1.5948,0.9169,4.502,0.8468,1.0642,0.4053,0.9514,0.0023,5.695,2.0619,2.2033,0.005,0.247,4.7053,1.4282,4.4031,3.9074,5.4934,3.9523,5.2374,0.9141,5.4721,1.5666,6.2484,0.1415,7.3195,3.4591,0.8014,2.9425,2.9003,1.2334,4.4078,7.4884,3.3655,0.1155,0.3475,8.1187,4.2946,1.1317,1.9521,0.0042,0.2118,1.8211,4.5912,1.6216,1.8756,1.3348,5.6923,1.8024,4.9467,7.6039,1.3883,4.3557,3.2408,7.2928,1.3084,8.8265,0.0007,2.9622,1.8654,1.8036,2.7861,0.2764,5.0033,2.1279,5.6886,4.1323,3.9215,2.6263,3.2716,1.6209,1.7841,2.9436,5.5925,1.675,3.6308,1.0544,1.9291,0.0015,0.1967,4.2644,3.8826,7.6671,5.0694,1.6401,5.0635,0.6643,4.6091,0.8021,0.4056,0.7518,0.0002,2.3333,3.8243,4.1115,0.2153,3.5512,1.6178,6.1904,5.6061,1.0462,4.5683,5.292,1.3901,1.4526,5.0716,3.9637,3.3282,1.5446,1.4888,0.3144,2.9184,5.4879,3.3965,0.0781,5.7194,3.1113,1.7712,3.1315,2.6209,1.5383,8.0113,1.0828,1.0517,0.8272,0.0002,2.8802,2.7185,0.0025,1.0288,3.4739,6.354,1.3783,2.3682,0.7267,5.0782,1.8953,4.3403,2.1589,5.2984,3.2999,2.539,3.7385,5.601,1.2655,1.2975,5.1181,0.0671,1.0931,4.4953,3.7897,2.0205,5.9338,0.1086,3.8578,2.1279,4.4011,6.328,0.5277,1.1301,3.6493,4.4388,3.9338,1.2893,3.7709,3.5116,2.0704,1.61,4.6697,5.8355,1.7788,0.4062,5.9717,1.6909,4.0168,1.6437,0.6068,0.5283,0.0002,3.5721,4.164,0.658,0.3647,4.4924,3.5634,0.1869,3.0604,4.0383,8.0391,7.2805,3.4666,7.9023,2.8444,6.1337,5.57,7.5217,6.4222,0.1594,0.4794,0.6297,3.3051,1.7857,0.749,4.6334,0.0704,1.0174,1.4485,1.7864,4.6363,1.6725,7.4419,0.5782,3.1185,1.8141,1.6722,3.3451,3.3823,3.8215,5.5764,1.7776,4.109,0.0964,1.7628,9.2545,0.5305,0.1406,0.7572,2.9075,0.8127,0.0765,0.5253,0.2665,0.0002,4.3564,3.1714,2.6086,2.985,3.236,5.3424,3.9344,3.3294,1.5344,8.2093,0.8504,0.2784,0.7262,0.7212,2.8478,1.2343,2.8503,3.6461,6.6632,2.5739,1.1507,7.6591,5.1246,0.9434,2.9962,5.5171,3.7497,0.0063,2.0509,4.1437,1.2276,0.4928,5.3073,5.8414,2.6839,2.3675,1.5739,1.5309,5.3583,0.3926,4.5222,0.9369,5.9625,1.4463,0.5463,0.5059,0.0002,3.7575,3.2258,2.487,3.8828,3.6625,0.6312,2.0293,1.315,0.3218,4.2989,1.4883,6.3759,0.1635,2.9236,0.1446,1.1312,0.3346,4.2697,0.7868,1.1334,6.7841,3.9302,2.3519,4.047,2.1537,0.6402,3.6293,0.4146,5.6757,0.0007,1.9731,4.9426,0.073,4.1653,2.2188,6.0541,3.7372,1.8295,4.6228,3.0879,3.7225,3.5921,2.4116,2.2069,2.0407,0.1493,7.7474,5.1019,2.4517,1.5044,1.6168,0.1396,2.5675]}

{"id":1241,"ended":false,"length":362,"text":"You buy a house with a tree in the backyard, after a while you realize that every time a leaf falls something bad, big or small, happens. The final leaf is about to fall. You have noticed the same thing before.\n\nIn our life, we have to deal with the same situations. Every situation we face is a blessing and also a test. As the tree is an analogy of life, let us understand the same.\n\nLife is never static. It keeps on changing. If we will keep ourselves away from the changes in life, we will be trapped into one place. That is why we are never happy, because one day we fall in love, the next day we are in an abusive relationship. The next day we have to say goodbye to our friends, but the day after we have to say hello to those friends. The other day we are at a happy occasion, the next day a sad event comes.\n\nWe are humans and we don't know the reasons why and what is happening in our life. It is natural and we all face these things. The question is how to deal with it?\n\nThe answer depends on what situation you are in. If you don't know what to do. Keep on practicing the principles of life. Don't worry much. You are the master of your life, you will be in control of things.\n\nThings don't change in life.

{"id":4485,"ended":true,"length":353,"text":"You've just died and gone to bureaucratic hell. Escape is possible, but really, really tedious. You and some other lost souls have decided to try.\n\nThe first thing you'll need to decide is who goes where. Then, you pick the route you're going to take while a guide ( an unseen hand ) leads the party.\n\nIn \"A trip to hell\" the player picks a starting location, the route they'll take, the encounters they'll face and then they'll be thrown in the deep end.\n\nThe players will be guided to and fro along a pre determined route with pre determined encounters and then will face a gauntlet of puzzles if they get lost.\n\nThe goal is to make it through. Once you have a party, all your players have to be willing to be brave, and to accept a lot of the dangers that may face you during your journey.\n\nEach player should have at least 8 dice, ( and that is in addition to dice for any powers ) and should all know their characters inside out.\n\nOnce you've got a party, you need to decide what route you'll take. The game isn't set up in real terms ( it's the players that have to work out how much food you'll need ).\n\nIf you choose to use dice, make sure everyone has an equal number.\n\nThe first step is figuring out the encounters.

{"id":3939,"ended":true,"length":364,"text":"It was around the time Mick Jagger hit age 125 that people got suspicious, when his body was found in an alley, completely drained of his vital fluids and filled, instead, with parasitic worm colonies. Now the question is on everyone's mind ; how long has rock really been dead?\n\nTheories abound, some stating it was never alive, much less dead. The fact the world's governments have been working with the music industry for years, including having the Beatles sign their names \"For the Love of Music!\", seems enough reason for most people. The fact the industry has been running for much longer, with much, much greater success than ever before, is just a coincidence, nothing more.\n\nIt makes you wonder, who else has been working with the industry for so long ; and why? The rumors seem too good to be true ; and perhaps they are, as much as anything to help people forget rock died all those years ago.\n\nOf course rock isn 't dead, the industry certainly is, they've proven that with their constant attempts to stop bands and control their messages. At this point, if there were any rock, it would probably be underground punk. It's not really a long stretch from where the British underground had begun only a few years back and it's already filled with political messages the establishment hates. It's just that when you control the media, you control the people, as well as their perceptions of the world.\n\nIf music is important, then so is the ability to express oneself freely. It's time to bring back the underground movement, it's truely needed for many of the same reasons rock was so important to society in the first place and for the same reasons we need it now.\n\nIt's simply a matter of having the freedom of choice. There, now we can all breathe again.","token_len":376,"entropy":[3.677,6.6195,2.1941,0.7689,10.8919,1.964,0.0005,4.8783,9.3655,9.7707,1.0388,5.4543,4.735,6.4425,3.1885,5.0142,3.4624,4.8065,1.5294,1.5022,1.3145,3.3002,1.7973,3.2776,6.9967,6.6229,0.7831,3.4529,7.1979,0.72,2.3634,6.3405,7.7398,5.7198,1.1292,0.0165,9.6438,5.0558,9.7897,0.7063,4.848,3.292,5.2591,0.5265,7.1487,2.656,0.2942,0.372,11.3568,2.3712,2.4784,3.5436,8.6666,6.8731,0.5063,3.9704,0.9038,0.9773,0.0928,2.5692,7.2006,1.2263,1.8371,3.7206,5.9734,3.0697,1.2021,4.9579,5.1567,1.171,7.6349,0.2546,1.8458,0.8235,2.9646,3.9889,4.531,5.1888,2.8362,7.8109,1.8047,1.9118,4.7272,3.1338,1.3906,7.4626,0.2411,1.7088,1.2155,2.8596,4.0419,6.5358,2.0354,4.6216,4.3905,3.5606,4.7055,6.7829,6.1218,2.3663,1.9696,0.2082,4.1084,6.5326,4.6317,7.4568,3.4906,1.8822,5.5635,1.0953,4.5709,2.773,2.1491,2.1994,5.7426,1.2145,1.4098,5.1904,2.4051,5.8923,0.3378,1.7461,2.7549,4.9721,5.4639,0.1098,3.4992,1.5197,1.4696,2.5271,0.4553,0.5086,1.8324,3.3485,2.156,2.7611,1.7306,6.6476,0.4517,0.9795,0.9232,0.0002,3.3928,5.5683,2.5468,0.1717,2.2037,3.5735,4.3341,2.1933,1.383,4.8557,1.1754,1.5912,3.0017,0.7691,1.4646,0.0686,6.9796,3.1704,1.9381,1.7458,3.2606,8.0581,3.66,5.7558,1.6515,0.0936,0.1846,0.004,3.5078,1.2003,4.8601,2.7261,0.9444,2.0838,2.7859,4.903,0.6258,2.6975,5.7618,5.9427,2.9369,4.228,5.4166,4.9457,5.8755,1.7142,0.1401,0.0291,0.4508,0.8102,0.0003,5.3839,0.1332,4.1944,4.2253,11.038,3.6883,0.6894,1.9354,4.1635,3.2582,5.8908,1.7849,1.5884,6.4648,3.0514,6.0709,2.0787,3.4596,2.2732,6.1734,5.3977,0.366,5.6301,6.9235,3.149,9.9941,1.6736,8.7349,1.3011,5.7015,2.9131,0.3641,0.8816,3.7201,3.0136,2.8596,1.3407,4.8785,4.8976,1.5849,1.2688,2.6897,0.2703,7.7589,5.4822,1.3027,3.075,1.0295,2.2238,4.0864,1.8417,6.4736,6.3171,4.0661,4.3919,2.3199,5.7797,3.1162,3.6594,4.735,9.2996,1.1362,0.5595,0.3482,2.7707,3.9,3.0862,1.0125,4.3858,6.0304,0.3739,8.1295,6.6749,6.4714,6.7066,5.358,1.0514,2.9692,0.4933,3.3789,1.7287,4.4448,2.5611,6.9625,1.2681,2.4773,1.0355,1.2257,2.9344,0.8808,2.2784,1.9152,4.1731,1.2394,0.9502,3.6691,5.7749,0.9485,1.8937,1.2682,0.647,0.6976,0.0002,3.5921,5.7004,1.6176,5.8541,1.5675,1.5131,4.0118,0.7602,1.8948,6.0445,0.4729,4.0384,2.7687,3.2791,1.0059,2.5311,0.5538,5.1786,0.884,4.7508,2.9913,1.198,4.1183,4.8712,1.375,4.2724,0.4423,6.4641,8.6212,5.375,2.8665,2.9203,3.2887,1.2538,2.2388,0.055,3.3875,1.2749,3.3598,0.7889,2.2719,5.1832,2.3089,0.3398,0.2786,0.0006,5.038,3.8541,2.0695,2.675,0.4043,2.5548,2.0752,1.8921,1.052,0.5331,0.9492,0.0003,3.285,0.5557,6.3443,2.3241,0.5121,0.0022,4.9135,1.7209,3.9837,3.3517,2.6059,1.6784,3.794,6.7766,3.9602,3.9874,1.0713,3.9762,6.2318,3.4973,1.0862]}

That's a lot better than what I was originally thinking.  I would think that, unless there were extenuating circumstances like she had a major medical condition and was in the hospital, it would be pretty disrespectful to have sex with her BF, regardless of whether you had already had sex with others.\nI would think that as well. My question was more about the \"no way in hell could I sleep with both of them\" side of things rather than \"well shit, I think I've got a good thing going with the GF, but at the same time...\"    (Of course I was talking about the hypothetical case where I had a chance to sleep with a girl and the BF was oblivious)\nI would think you had some pretty serious moral issues, too.

However, no evidence has been found that shows that the probe stopped or even entered into a system.\n\nIs the probe from an advanced civilization that has already visited the Earth and is now coming back?\n\nThe SETI team expects that the first actual contact made with an alien civilization will be within the next few years.","token_len":376,"entropy":[5.0833,13.0745,1.9217,7.636,0.7669,11.5195,3.8312,2.5236,5.2024,3.3183,10.5905,0.0835,1.0039,1.9544,4.9538,5.2168,1.5767,7.3406,12.2278,3.9873,4.5811,4.3337,8.2979,2.6386,3.4833,1.0659,4.3849,3.296,2.0074,0.0492,2.2265,2.9762,6.6391,1.5011,5.3972,0.0012,5.7934,0.5506,0.8894,5.691,5.6621,6.4037,0.6018,7.5735,4.6316,1.876,4.9887,3.9746,5.2168,2.7969,0.0637,0.2145,0.1582,0.2031,0.0022,0.0175,0.0033,0.1371,4.5796,4.625,2.1413,0.7097,0.6526,2.9462,1.7064,3.986,0.7297,7.7116,2.9175,1.1158,7.1549,2.9352,0.5502,1.2348,0.0004,4.2296,0.0032,4.6906,0.9203,0.9541,0.0351,0.4971,0.0208,0.155,0.5848,0.0257,0.175,0.0018,0.0062,0.0826,0.037,0.0577,0.0363,0.0403,0.5273,0.0119,0.0138,0.0141,0.1227,0.0003,0.0037,0.0014,0.0748,0.6378,8.3017,1.1584,0.0002,1.6904,4.1364,0.0018,4.6765,2.7575,3.9435,3.0614,1.1893,6.8708,0.0364,4.0865,1.8876,4.8513,0.5884,3.1223,0.8995,7.5213,2.4639,0.4204,1.2182,4.6475,4.5364,0.5842,1.4889,0.0004,3.1888,5.4147,2.6339,9.133,7.7023,0.0179,0.3068,3.921,1.1348,4.9341,1.6912,3.784,3.1977,5.8814,0.6785,2.2564,4.2357,3.1104,0.0081,5.795,3.2418,5.5246,0.9118,1.9195,2.3009,3.8743,2.3313,5.8759,0.0311,1.178,6.4541,1.1848,4.6953,0.0232,1.3811,0.8484,1.8313,4.1523,5.2452,5.3261,4.5682,6.4088,6.2632,0.0023,4.5163,0.4608,0.2387,0.8351,0.0003,6.7956,2.3794,7.4041,4.8318,1.1196,2.2568,1.5993,4.4583,0.6144,1.7017,0.0002,1.916,1.5463,0.0033,0.7016,1.091,0.866,1.3941,0.3129,2.1667,0.0019,0.3423,0.0624,0.1554,0.0077,0.0748,0.0238,0.049,0.0078,0.0012,0.0065,0.0082,0.0215,0.0304,0.6286,0.0002,0.9378,0.0672,0.0047,0.0336,0.0075,0.0007,0.0021,0.1936,0.0048,0.0224,0.003,0.0135,0.0041,0.0026,0.0014,0.0079,0.0039,0.0002,0.0006,0.0037,0.0029,0.0007,0.0038,0.0035,0.0489,0.0012,0.0022,0.0013,0.001,0.0024,0.0014,0.0005,0.0034,0.0007,0.0074,0.0008,0.005,0.0004,0.0056,0.0035,0.0032,0.002,0.0006,0.0004,0.0,0.0017,0.0014,0.1998,0.0002,2.4185,0.095,0.0095,0.0194,0.0021,0.0388,0.0123,0.5688,0.0062,0.1629,0.0002,5.6658,0.0031,3.3303,4.8169,0.6949,6.896,0.3667,1.8353,1.8978,4.5692,1.872,1.7777,3.6413,2.1217,5.184,4.3023,5.6313,5.9424,0.9646,1.0878,0.7179,1.7619,5.3574,6.7595,1.5353,2.9398,3.6887,1.9055,0.6405,1.2162,0.0033,1.3512,3.8872,0.0513,3.4287,2.9696,0.7482,0.3452,0.4233,1.8608,5.2829,1.183,1.0773,0.4213,5.7181,4.435,2.9535,4.1268,3.3681,1.4998,4.2219,1.9906,0.4859,0.0002,3.4591,2.3023,0.5246,5.5983,2.5438,3.8479,0.4003,3.6936,1.6006,3.729,3.9265,1.9751,3.0718,2.779,2.3597,1.9778,4.7997,1.3062,1.3479,0.1813,0.0002,1.1879,0.8133,0.0055,0.2632,7.9396,1.2644,0.9661,4.7228,9.192,1.4091,6.1145,0.9112,1.7045,2.2842,0.5221,1.1637,1.2802,4.2656,0.8222,0.3716,1.3703,0.5702,0.2987]}

No guidelines.\n\nIn our society today we have an excess of the written word. It is easy for us to have an excess in time to tell stories.\n\nIn \"A New Way To Tell Stories\" I want to encourage readers to get back to the art of telling stories orally. It may seem that nothing good comes from this. There are a lot of old tales that tell of how stories got lost through time. There are a lot of old tales that only got passed down through word of mouth.\n\nWith that said here are a few reminders of where to get started ;\n\nFirst. Let's make sure that there is no good old tales that we need to let go.\n\nThe \"Book of Lyrical Ballads\" has the song lyrics and is available in most areas. These song lyrics are a good starting point.\n\nSecond. Tell the story to your kids. Let your kids read the story to other kids.\n\nThe first book I wrote for my son. ( he is the second child in my family to read this story ) It is a short story that he loves to share. I have also had the chance to tell the story to other children at my local library.

{"id":598,"ended":false,"length":345,"text":"2,000 years after the nuclear war, small tribes uncovered the only remnants of the past civilization -- the Sesame Street studios. They begin to construct their philosophies, religions, and law around these divine places of worship.\n\nThe town is divided between those who believe Elmo is a god -- and those, including Sheriff Hooper, who call Elmo a monster. The town's children, the Elmoites, are constantly being threatened by the Sheriff and Sheriff Hooper, who try to outlaw Elmo and the Church of the Sock Monster. Elmo, however, knows that he must become the one thing the Church fears and use it to his advantage. That means he must play the two sides against one another so he can take the town for himself.\n\nTrollhunters and the Secret of NIMH are all great. The first one has one of the creepiest stories I've ever seen. The second one got away from me due to the fact that I had to read it in the 2nd and 3rd grade in school, both times were really long, but I did enjoy it. I've been looking to watch it, so this is perfect.\n\nI love all three of those movies. I especially love the first Trollhunter movie. I think that it would be really interesting if one of the sequels was the story behind the movie and where it came from. The main character would be an orphaned girl who would end up working at Sesame Street. I know that they've discussed that Elmo is a puppet who got replaced... But, I think that they could make a very cool story.\n\n2. I really love all three of those movies and especially the first one because it was so scary! I hope that they do the third movie and have a happy ending where Elmo gets to live on Sesame Street!","token_len":379,"entropy":[2.9179,2.681,6.3125,4.769,0.7773,8.0522,2.8679,1.4246,8.9321,7.0167,10.3105,2.1275,6.2992,3.5765,0.0254,1.4059,5.2371,5.9526,5.5826,1.6724,7.1626,6.9211,4.0193,9.7119,1.0427,3.3155,7.833,1.2048,6.9328,2.6717,12.8308,1.8332,5.4311,0.3413,0.7176,8.4428,4.4618,3.1473,9.9499,5.3492,3.4322,2.2757,0.5311,1.3875,0.0015,2.1165,7.4244,2.5005,3.5046,2.1848,4.585,0.3413,1.6153,11.7802,2.1497,1.5277,1.7628,1.9249,4.9759,1.8793,0.2584,7.2301,3.4938,8.9452,6.2329,1.5648,0.2591,0.5564,5.7856,1.9948,0.011,1.3444,5.3118,1.8507,2.0857,2.402,1.6576,6.04,2.2595,3.1136,4.7396,0.0753,2.9092,0.2127,1.4846,5.8442,3.1541,5.0876,0.6564,1.074,4.9803,2.2706,3.9085,1.4552,0.0019,1.4797,1.1266,5.1714,0.0762,7.9005,3.2998,0.0066,2.4431,3.0456,7.4254,0.6998,1.3005,3.9671,9.2352,6.5362,0.5109,3.2945,0.0089,2.8473,2.5022,0.0258,5.8005,1.6392,1.5935,2.9232,5.0374,1.533,5.0123,6.6386,3.3904,4.6021,7.3179,2.9726,7.6802,2.9211,0.4464,1.7561,0.2232,0.4001,5.7969,2.7096,2.0915,0.342,6.3572,1.4901,7.2947,2.931,3.8577,2.8218,0.0256,5.0457,1.9179,0.2055,3.7242,2.1986,4.3409,4.1519,0.1034,0.4242,0.709,0.0002,5.5817,5.3423,5.186,0.081,2.7722,2.9131,7.329,3.5917,6.2391,8.1852,1.5493,2.4055,4.6237,7.8005,4.3555,2.6991,4.892,3.6955,4.3555,5.8024,1.7282,0.5883,7.2668,0.0629,3.5896,1.9309,0.331,0.4532,1.3615,0.8683,1.8171,2.9066,0.6096,7.4966,6.4383,2.6622,0.6616,6.1537,0.0183,1.4693,2.1082,0.1611,1.9064,2.651,1.4915,3.062,1.3419,2.3075,2.0822,7.7698,0.4849,3.8222,0.4442,0.0059,2.384,4.4223,3.8557,2.2537,7.5988,3.7839,8.4659,4.8962,3.6742,2.2797,2.024,1.533,3.9705,2.8049,0.5659,0.6619,2.0887,3.3204,2.5013,3.6511,3.6984,3.5443,1.6255,3.3725,2.488,4.0929,1.2746,4.8839,0.6177,0.8003,0.0002,2.6494,2.754,4.1026,3.6757,1.2636,2.9572,2.6095,1.0023,1.7913,5.9549,1.0041,0.8271,2.2096,8.0273,1.2528,1.997,1.3775,1.6823,2.9337,2.3472,3.0131,4.5075,0.5567,4.0837,3.1913,2.1184,3.8433,0.3201,0.8844,4.2174,2.3302,3.1388,5.0775,6.6358,0.8445,2.757,2.8474,5.9581,1.3273,2.2227,0.0207,0.3828,2.1708,5.1733,1.2756,4.7108,1.0353,3.4701,3.9232,2.0276,2.6378,1.4978,3.7542,4.4028,0.0124,4.8345,1.7409,5.5915,0.0962,0.0702,1.3797,2.6507,3.7541,0.9754,4.3182,3.5383,6.2461,2.4091,9.807,0.0066,1.2972,0.9158,6.6257,3.9193,6.3394,6.6401,7.9666,4.8976,2.808,1.8901,1.9472,1.1161,2.9074,2.9301,3.0142,1.2894,4.0945,4.3651,2.2093,2.1572,0.8427,0.0003,6.4815,0.9337,4.5336,4.1318,2.0767,4.0222,0.7941,0.3725,0.4075,0.0851,4.8174,5.0339,0.5339,1.226,2.0179,4.8643,0.9028,2.3962,2.1172,4.8089,3.7738,1.633,5.6703,1.2478,2.0957,2.8607,3.0526,5.7098,2.3234,2.3892,3.9538,1.2161,5.699,0.0986,6.228,2.0308,0.0079,2.9607,1.4919,2.2137,3.3856,3.7409,0.0012,0.0087,2.7695]}

There are a lot of old tales that only got passed down through word of mouth.\n\nWith that said here are a few reminders of where to get started ;\n\nFirst. Let's make sure that there is no good old tales that we need to let go.\n\nThe \"Book of Lyrical Ballads\" has the song lyrics and is available in most areas.

It is easy for us to have an excess in time to tell stories.\n\nIn \"A New Way To Tell Stories\" I want to encourage readers to get back to the art of telling stories orally. It may seem that nothing good comes from this. There are a lot of old tales that tell of how stories got lost through time. There are a lot of old tales that only got passed down through word of mouth.\n\nWith that said here are a few reminders of where to get started ;\n\nFirst. Let's make sure that there is no good old tales that we need to let go.\n\nThe \"Book of Lyrical Ballads\" has the song lyrics and is available in most areas. These song lyrics are a good starting point.\n\nSecond. Tell the story to your kids. Let your kids read the story to other kids.\n\nThe first book I wrote for my son. ( he is the second child in my family to read this story ) It is a short story that he loves to share. I have also had the chance to tell the story to other children at my local library.

{"id":4214,"ended":true,"length":331,"text":"George Lucas suddenly dies from a heart attack prior to writing the script for Star Wars Episode 1. You've been handed the reins to write the story leading up to Episodes 4-6. What would you add into the story?\n\nIn Episode IV, we've got Anakin Skywalker being born, the rise of the Empire and the death of Luke's father, the Jedi temple burning down, the Clone Wars, etc. If I did the next three movies, I might do the following things:\n\n1) Return Vader to his role as a fearsome Sith Lord. Start by killing Qui-Gon Jinn and setting up Episode VI by having Obi-Wan be the old man who's had everything (i.e. the Jedi temple, the old man and his apprentice training) taken away from him. To me, this would create an interesting mirror of Obi-Wan and Anakin's relationship.\n\n2) Introduce the final showdown between Obi-Wan and Vader on Coruscant.\n\n3) Have both of those happen right before going to Kashyyk. I would introduce an interesting romance between Palpatine and Ahsoka, or Darth Vader and Padme, that brings to a close the old man and young apprentice relationship.\n\n4) Have the first Jedi Temple fall. I'd create a great rivalry between Count Dooku (who is, after all, a Jedi) and Kenobi, who is not a Jedi any more. I'd have both of these two go against each other in order to prevent the Empire from taking over the Galaxy.\n\n5) I would have Palpatine and Vader duel on Mustafar, and the battle between the two characters would end with Vader being redeemed. The scene where Anakin sacrifices himself to save Vader is done, and Obi-Wan goes off to join Luke on Dagobah.","token_len":381,"entropy":[9.9069,10.9114,5.8052,3.8308,1.2654,1.0289,0.0265,8.8737,0.006,6.7168,1.8421,2.3452,1.0621,1.389,0.0773,1.7894,4.881,0.9144,5.5307,4.311,3.016,8.7247,1.4204,5.638,2.1766,4.1491,1.4258,3.3137,7.6172,0.206,0.0154,7.8491,0.0443,3.576,2.5418,1.0624,1.129,3.3082,4.0171,0.7482,5.7031,7.2878,0.9248,2.6805,1.1812,0.5939,0.0009,4.7204,2.1913,5.6072,0.4585,1.8107,3.289,1.8019,5.9425,0.0042,1.2818,4.7319,5.3316,1.6886,3.3685,7.8943,0.1709,1.2851,1.8919,1.4118,1.0218,3.1965,0.0318,3.7062,5.6058,0.685,1.1179,3.2439,2.6388,8.5843,8.248,1.1635,1.6092,1.5855,4.5882,0.2216,1.1748,4.6671,0.2915,5.5792,2.416,5.1367,2.778,5.6675,2.7502,3.098,0.5051,0.6397,4.0038,3.0048,2.0503,3.4825,2.7438,0.8569,0.7173,0.0003,2.2316,1.2599,4.8589,8.6455,1.0011,2.2391,6.1097,0.196,2.2926,8.2699,3.7295,0.4365,1.3972,9.1878,2.2722,3.3282,6.7814,0.1412,0.0078,0.0003,0.0001,0.4412,1.4825,5.8036,0.989,6.7827,3.1894,4.6124,3.9061,3.6653,0.0586,0.0027,4.2456,1.254,7.4836,2.2464,2.3637,4.2729,4.7605,6.0571,5.3851,5.5799,0.0039,0.0006,0.2524,2.0926,3.1868,3.9823,2.2034,1.2635,6.2674,2.5011,3.3279,2.2951,3.6776,7.2728,2.8426,4.4023,1.3066,1.1871,0.1121,0.6723,6.3922,4.4312,0.4156,1.1423,2.1344,4.9042,2.371,1.4317,9.0926,2.5951,2.7566,0.0097,0.0033,2.6278,3.641,0.0003,1.4432,2.0019,0.9065,0.7111,0.0003,0.0398,0.0043,4.3707,0.0346,1.7839,6.422,3.9083,0.4229,2.2638,0.0111,0.0072,0.227,3.6014,3.7666,4.5767,0.0,0.0008,0.5889,2.7433,0.0003,0.0566,0.0033,4.6594,5.3339,3.3702,4.0278,4.3988,5.0205,0.9089,6.6907,0.9751,6.857,0.0009,8.9125,0.7731,3.182,2.7909,6.4174,4.2263,2.4002,7.8319,0.6076,6.5623,0.0002,0.0001,0.2174,4.6369,0.0013,0.0,1.7357,3.7517,6.2514,0.4242,1.1754,5.4324,1.9282,1.7856,5.2059,7.9606,3.8096,4.2746,1.3342,0.6474,4.5891,3.3029,1.9641,4.7405,3.1112,1.6023,0.6537,0.4426,0.0003,1.1366,0.0067,2.4787,2.1675,4.6252,3.8474,2.562,4.7386,1.7452,2.2894,1.9849,4.632,0.7179,5.0978,5.891,0.2555,6.5442,0.007,0.0,0.0,3.0877,2.3153,2.0381,5.3589,3.1099,0.0267,0.0476,1.6725,1.4387,1.1377,0.0135,5.2743,1.5018,1.8423,1.1028,4.4067,1.1353,0.4977,8.7205,0.0966,0.6862,2.4192,0.8794,3.0543,4.1054,1.6759,2.717,4.842,3.4472,4.2902,1.1301,0.0116,1.7901,4.0509,0.0581,4.0298,1.1154,2.8839,0.2548,2.4503,0.6901,1.071,6.0934,0.4484,0.5678,0.0002,0.4654,0.0056,4.092,1.4136,2.26,5.5273,0.0007,0.0009,1.6625,4.794,4.2658,2.8993,6.9945,0.0022,0.0001,1.71,2.2314,3.1086,4.223,3.538,2.4309,0.653,4.4779,0.351,1.9746,1.4129,2.5556,3.1298,8.819,1.084,3.4864,4.7892,2.5497,3.7544,0.0002,8.0578,1.2883,0.7392,0.4838,3.7211,1.8239,6.1407,3.5411,1.241,3.0803,0.0076,0.0039,3.9041,2.9567,0.6064,4.8596,3.8148,2.5075,6.9442,0.0012,0.0001,0.6763]}
{"id":1650,"ended":true,"length":353,"text":"After J. R. R. Tolkien passes away, he finds himself washed up on the white shores of Valinor. There he finds the place is empty except for an old man, a young man and a huge tree. The old man, Gandalf, has come to him in time out of the world to speak through the tree. He tells him of his experiences with the Maiar ( the Gods ). Gandalf has seen Galadriel, one of the Valar ( the High Divine ). They have seen the destruction of the Balrog of Morgoth, and have walked through the Gates of Twilight. Galadriel tells of the One Ring that held great power that was lost long ago and it was a great evil as its last owner was corrupted by it. Gandalf tells his companions of the prophecy : \"There can come to Numinor no second Valar, though there be many Valar; for the Valar and Numinor are not two; but that there may come a time when the Valar must all be destroyed, that no evil may long endure.\" As the tree has power Gandalf must use it to reach to the One Ring. At first he can find no way. There is a power within the tree that is the heart of the tree and as long as it stands strong the tree cannot be toppled. They then enter a secret place in the tree to find that one must climb the great trunk while walking to reach the root. Then, with much help from the tree they are able to break away the One Ring from the hand of Dol Guldur ( Black Numenor ) the Shadow Lord. The One Ring is then buried deep within the mountain of Mandos, and the three companions return to Rivendell ( the White City ) leaving the tree behind. The next time the Three meet Gandalf will tell them the tale of the One Ring.","token_len":382,"entropy":[7.4724,2.7074,5.1877,0.1324,1.2234,0.5826,0.0795,11.4251,0.6463,0.8626,2.7509,6.6201,1.1641,11.4682,0.9227,1.9452,1.1131,7.7932,4.6326,0.0356,6.252,0.6547,0.0006,1.2062,3.8797,1.4745,1.8449,2.2024,6.0048,7.0633,3.8535,4.137,0.2168,3.6097,1.473,1.6816,1.776,1.857,2.5518,1.1754,3.4881,0.4638,6.6949,4.4035,0.9114,2.1953,1.6068,0.0362,2.4944,7.2388,0.0084,0.2384,2.5094,3.5145,0.6343,3.9763,3.1292,5.3648,8.4733,0.0467,1.4622,3.7114,2.0787,4.6598,6.8946,1.3335,3.9385,1.1645,1.5295,2.2286,0.3937,2.5899,1.8628,5.6548,1.8653,0.8021,11.2064,0.4066,4.1623,9.0245,7.0599,4.4033,2.0923,0.0002,3.1366,3.3307,7.5521,0.0314,0.003,1.7867,5.7185,0.0594,0.2139,6.5505,0.3913,3.8783,2.453,5.5203,10.708,1.6822,4.7092,1.8935,3.2369,1.4547,5.3924,0.1568,0.7734,6.4022,0.0527,5.0861,5.132,0.0033,1.8486,1.4706,3.5781,6.9445,1.807,0.5418,7.6627,0.1448,4.5186,1.1458,2.7695,0.0026,0.0035,2.5561,3.8689,1.1973,7.1795,0.5023,2.3565,5.237,4.921,0.1632,4.8667,2.6596,2.9564,5.4685,0.1142,2.556,4.1817,1.6248,4.3334,2.4318,4.0714,6.3073,5.0893,4.9536,6.6654,2.7443,7.5463,0.8638,4.4194,0.2513,2.626,0.0009,2.8011,3.8643,4.5452,2.0652,0.8154,4.2945,8.7574,1.0412,4.2979,4.986,4.3665,2.7833,5.8634,11.5837,2.2075,3.5341,7.1247,8.8105,0.0952,1.5694,6.3346,2.7496,5.0843,2.1886,3.174,0.0499,5.5055,2.5963,2.1159,4.2572,0.0268,4.3308,4.4733,0.023,0.4528,1.2669,3.5123,3.4778,5.2504,2.3371,4.7252,3.8218,2.05,2.4704,2.0105,2.8666,0.5458,1.6286,1.8694,0.0316,4.1501,4.9216,1.6737,2.9861,1.6393,2.9103,3.9499,4.8658,0.9381,9.1964,3.3903,2.411,4.7029,1.6863,5.0058,3.6238,8.5271,8.2692,0.0039,4.4476,5.1183,0.6856,0.8618,4.3868,4.3164,0.7425,2.5386,0.0747,1.3662,4.4048,3.6674,1.0455,4.1232,4.0686,1.5082,2.7207,3.3426,4.4582,0.7068,1.4851,5.5064,3.0017,2.5383,1.2202,1.0464,2.045,4.3051,7.0741,0.1414,1.3487,4.2041,2.2426,4.8723,3.6484,0.0129,1.6073,5.637,5.0391,2.691,1.8246,3.9465,0.8021,5.6663,0.4872,5.5108,4.5004,4.8369,2.1021,5.2906,3.4362,2.3301,0.4279,2.7738,3.3753,1.7325,3.6921,3.5982,4.3959,5.9784,1.7266,3.9853,5.7211,6.7074,4.4705,3.0489,1.9585,0.4713,4.49,0.5312,3.5848,2.862,3.1915,6.128,4.0348,0.557,0.7264,2.4006,2.775,2.9979,0.6388,0.0128,5.2809,4.6468,2.9993,6.3065,0.0066,2.7367,0.3725,6.1629,0.4505,9.5549,0.0279,0.0008,0.0009,3.4157,7.682,6.758,1.8591,2.6385,1.6158,4.1272,6.0929,1.9598,1.1008,1.9103,4.7078,0.0185,0.9086,4.1504,7.2256,3.386,1.3553,0.2298,5.746,3.006,9.7994,4.1664,2.1457,1.5976,1.7892,5.0225,6.2899,4.1327,0.4274,4.2031,0.0007,0.0004,3.071,2.6097,4.2333,3.7273,0.6751,8.0783,1.678,2.6035,2.8667,0.4772,2.0899,3.6647,2.7904,1.9407,4.5141,4.1334,2.3268,0.0009,1.8612,2.7676,0.8528,2.6606,4.4583,0.345,1.1666,2.4173,0.0356,1.5497]}

Closing the door behind him you notice, the man you thought was your father, walks into the room too!","token_len":383,"entropy":[11.1595,0.6054,2.3923,2.8879,10.4264,4.3898,4.1267,3.4323,1.3562,10.081,2.9554,1.9054,1.7935,4.4156,8.9642,5.6932,5.6467,0.7966,3.7786,0.2682,0.8749,3.855,3.9187,4.1621,2.9786,0.5894,7.8039,1.9248,4.5465,1.063,2.9709,6.7801,6.7082,1.0817,1.5749,5.6989,5.7735,8.8735,1.4729,9.9997,0.6406,0.7098,6.2955,2.1127,3.0383,0.0291,3.9819,2.6666,0.6268,1.7872,5.7328,2.4476,0.7135,4.6876,2.4299,5.5134,4.6549,16.6955,7.5547,2.1948,4.6358,0.6559,4.8848,3.9538,2.5736,4.1875,1.3218,0.4388,0.0207,4.3539,3.2141,4.2006,3.43,6.9465,1.8891,0.8746,1.0544,4.6347,0.7357,3.7787,1.4713,5.4512,1.3795,0.4425,6.9029,4.5231,0.4102,5.0863,0.8663,6.8594,1.9716,1.9084,2.0235,0.2836,0.1449,0.0049,0.9526,0.0029,0.3979,2.8872,3.0567,6.5528,6.8355,0.2623,8.2591,2.664,2.4902,2.5394,3.4784,2.8295,6.4188,2.9335,1.6251,1.1467,0.3089,7.3942,0.6443,0.1352,0.5316,3.2065,2.9421,1.013,0.905,5.2009,4.9527,1.3438,2.3095,2.3866,0.5961,2.4213,4.7016,7.0593,7.4839,0.1666,6.1679,2.8947,0.0019,9.8005,6.6046,3.0318,0.4521,2.4367,5.7441,0.3828,0.0057,4.7127,1.5388,2.8413,8.0297,0.0108,1.5203,5.4526,2.4414,0.7153,6.3691,0.4527,1.2791,4.3638,5.6427,4.5252,8.2367,1.681,4.952,0.6749,1.9152,3.117,1.7035,1.097,1.1743,4.5089,2.3045,4.8316,1.3116,5.0885,6.3273,7.4659,2.6854,5.3611,1.8924,3.1633,2.1976,1.8134,7.2086,5.2796,0.5322,2.3868,1.6406,0.8306,2.8028,5.6709,2.7864,5.4361,0.4411,5.6506,3.1784,0.3043,2.1132,4.523,1.6595,3.4155,2.8738,3.4823,1.0446,0.0564,2.1498,2.3778,1.3405,3.1968,1.7532,2.2178,4.2301,5.1381,6.0451,1.0327,1.8553,0.563,2.5622,3.5772,3.4963,0.9489,2.3046,3.0882,5.2489,0.5638,1.8184,4.9315,0.3856,0.9435,1.6655,2.4435,0.377,2.1853,3.1016,3.4409,3.8489,3.0988,2.7025,5.9278,1.2591,0.7858,4.4769,3.8501,0.9271,3.688,2.5196,1.9483,4.3887,1.3228,3.4064,4.5943,0.7334,0.6611,2.202,3.9151,2.3888,5.3209,0.6224,4.2596,3.0655,1.8091,5.509,1.3743,5.7218,2.3888,3.7777,1.5031,4.16,1.8951,5.1247,3.3203,2.7928,7.5095,5.2615,0.4816,1.1481,0.0591,1.1944,5.1526,0.1776,0.1968,0.424,0.5125,2.1369,1.8926,0.6815,3.1952,5.2815,5.944,0.281,0.2044,0.0534,0.7196,1.1076,2.9871,1.0967,1.8976,2.3333,1.1923,2.0899,2.1499,1.6304,4.4319,0.9076,3.3646,2.5506,4.6396,4.2111,0.6516,2.3134,4.8477,3.8308,4.6209,11.9664,0.5795,5.7337,0.1349,1.5703,7.5341,2.956,7.9684,1.313,3.9081,1.4828,1.6711,0.3345,0.7446,1.6374,4.3263,1.7038,1.9676,0.7123,7.2071,1.6175,2.9111,1.9434,0.2469,0.1539,2.7722,0.8007,3.1857,4.1413,0.8267,1.4738,0.6435,0.245,4.5931,5.162,4.0525,2.4108,4.3937,4.0532,5.1842,0.8649,4.6653,0.4449,4.0262,0.9314,1.032,2.0146,0.6097,7.1845,0.2525,0.4268,4.2947,0.1105,1.3091,3.2072,4.4817,4.3192,2.6472,4.2917,2.1982,1.3457,0.3232,4.3781,2.1752,5.6677,2.3942,0.6898,0.7052,8.5577,6.9801]}

{"id":599,"ended":false,"length":379,"text":"Starting at the age of 10, humans are given companion animals that develop along side them. These animals can range anywhere from a goldfish to a horse to even a dragon. The only catch is that they are assigned based on your behavior during childhood.\n\nThe book is divided between the first four stories of a kid named Billy. The story starts with Billy waking up from surgery while a small dog washes his wound out with the blood from an operating table. But there are no parents for Billy to ask. The story begins with Billy's pet dog named Jack running around with him in the forest, playing with toys. Billy plays with him and even feeds him some fruit. Next day, while Billy is playing alone, he bumps into a small puppy. When the puppy tries to lick out Billy's wound, Billy stops him and yells. Once again, as he feeds his pet, Jack tries to lick out Billy's wound and he stops him. As the day ends, a little girl comes to pick up Jack and she hands him over to Billy. He is amazed that she will let Jack stay with him. Once again, as the night ends, a little boy comes and picks up Jack. The kid hands him over to Billy again and tells him that they want to take care of Jack. By now, Billy can tell that Jack isn't like the other pets. It is only the next day that he will realize what he has gotten himself into.\n\nDuring these six days, Billy learns a lot about dogs.

{"id":1978,"ended":false,"length":379,"text":"Starting at the age of 10, humans are given companion animals that develop along side them. These animals can range anywhere from a goldfish to a horse to even a dragon. The only catch is that they are assigned based on your behavior during childhood.\n\nThe book is divided between the first four stories of a kid named Billy. The story starts with Billy waking up from surgery while a small dog washes his wound out with the blood from an operating table. But there are no parents for Billy to ask. The story begins with Billy's pet dog named Jack running around with him in the forest, playing with toys. Billy plays with him and even feeds him some fruit. Next day, while Billy is playing alone, he bumps into a small puppy. When the puppy tries to lick out Billy's wound, Billy stops him and yells. Once again, as he feeds his pet, Jack tries to lick out Billy's wound and he stops him. As the day ends, a little girl comes to pick up Jack and she hands him over to Billy. He is amazed that she will let Jack stay with him. Once again, as the night ends, a little boy comes and picks up Jack. The kid hands him over to Billy again and tells him that they want to take care of Jack. By now, Billy can tell that Jack isn't like the other pets. It is only the next day that he will realize what he has gotten himself into.\n\nDuring these six days, Billy learns a lot about dogs. He learned that they need to sleep when they are supposed to and they wake up on their own. He also learned of the importance of taking care of them. But the most important thing that he learned during these few days was to be honest with the man.

Remarkably Death appears to explain to him the importance of life and why he needs to live. The final scene is a mirror image of the beginning of the film. Very dark but thought provoking.\n\nCemetery of Dead Dreams has that \"Twilight-like\" atmosphere, which can be quite interesting. I did like the film, though the ending didn't make too much sense. But I can't say much more, since nothing really happened at this point.\n\nIt's a good movie, and I enjoy every once of it. I liked the beginning, but the movie started dragging towards the middle and had some dull scenes that could have had better direction. Overall, a good movie. But don't expect to have your mind blown.\n\nOne of the most creative movies I have ever seen. The scene where the father is telling the son his dreams is really intense. If you enjoy thinking that is will change your life then watch this film right now.\n\nThis movie has definitely given me an interesting outlook on life. Very creative. The atmosphere, characters and message is fascinating. Definitely don't regret watching this. It is definitely a must see!\n\nSo what is this movie all about? The short version is that a young man is having night terrors. When he wakes up he is crying because he feels so horrible. He is also told that he might have a brain tumor. He believes that this is true because he is being attacked in his dreams by other people. His father tries to convince him to go to school and live a normal life but the boy refuses. He begins spending nights in bed again and begins to die of a \"disease\" that will surely kill him. His father also finds out that this isn't so sure thing anyway.","token_len":386,"entropy":[8.2558,5.9636,14.1439,10.9519,5.0866,9.9742,2.8737,12.9443,6.1751,4.8479,5.381,5.4045,2.5636,9.4897,8.0373,1.9854,7.8114,2.0605,0.2483,4.9559,5.9809,4.9287,0.8714,9.0729,4.1274,0.0859,8.3101,5.9562,1.3185,7.9181,2.6417,0.7052,2.6097,4.8239,0.0338,4.0669,1.3718,5.1647,0.7615,2.5587,0.7989,2.2773,1.2043,3.1944,5.9053,1.8761,1.8571,2.2823,7.5635,1.1556,0.0861,1.437,4.5461,0.3625,0.9775,2.1342,1.1302,7.8895,4.0757,4.2519,8.8257,0.455,0.7314,1.937,0.2054,5.1691,6.5487,1.8581,6.5732,7.551,5.7313,6.4355,4.4964,7.6165,0.6319,4.3691,1.8761,1.3494,3.6005,2.4131,2.728,4.0174,0.595,3.2999,4.2105,1.1173,2.4102,4.9761,2.814,0.9646,5.2844,2.8279,3.0089,3.6868,2.9329,3.9883,0.0046,3.3511,5.6213,0.1494,0.0398,0.9477,4.4189,1.701,3.9398,0.5352,1.7494,3.2602,1.966,3.5604,2.129,6.1272,2.2451,2.5269,3.4686,2.3979,0.224,0.5087,1.2784,0.0002,4.4757,1.1491,1.8965,3.1324,1.6169,1.1405,1.8478,1.597,5.3504,4.0405,7.1192,9.4352,0.2205,0.2698,1.8321,4.3324,1.0643,5.4506,1.9665,1.3541,2.2966,3.9803,4.5004,7.5997,5.5009,0.9623,4.2305,2.4861,4.6927,2.1977,6.2853,3.039,2.1053,4.3355,0.9078,3.9695,3.4685,4.446,0.4889,5.0464,0.6277,2.9425,1.2486,0.7498,1.0083,4.3503,4.2174,0.0026,1.3936,1.8419,4.2851,4.8525,4.2891,0.4098,1.9497,0.8632,0.0003,5.6938,1.3927,0.5647,2.4874,7.2068,3.2768,0.8776,1.6432,1.2557,0.1596,0.5759,3.096,5.9282,0.8921,1.9392,6.7118,2.214,6.2039,1.3491,2.8309,3.651,5.138,2.3158,2.6589,5.7499,0.7508,4.7587,0.4971,4.2002,7.7849,4.9638,6.2906,6.9027,6.6878,0.5234,1.0345,7.3741,3.2963,0.636,3.1514,7.2642,0.475,0.2937,0.8376,0.0003,3.5592,1.8331,2.4164,5.8157,4.6156,0.1935,2.9479,3.5347,5.7362,0.2568,0.8744,0.5543,6.2763,4.6686,2.0906,3.1787,4.7979,2.8093,3.8914,1.2291,7.8649,2.3364,5.746,0.696,5.2866,7.4313,0.0019,7.7321,2.037,0.3838,2.0343,3.1732,2.0546,2.7402,2.036,2.0995,1.9155,3.8401,0.4154,0.0002,5.233,2.7406,2.2756,3.3632,0.9068,3.1503,0.0035,0.175,3.4975,6.3967,2.7098,0.9742,1.0966,4.2281,3.0849,1.3309,2.1711,5.095,8.5714,1.8981,0.0456,1.6093,4.1641,0.5574,0.907,0.1112,1.0513,1.6715,6.6218,3.1241,0.6252,4.0033,2.8479,4.2484,1.1214,1.3736,1.8726,3.291,4.7876,0.6643,0.9898,5.5924,2.1271,2.2139,4.5252,0.7239,1.2132,1.5086,4.9323,0.8967,2.4696,0.741,4.3629,3.4634,0.7407,1.7035,3.8734,4.5899,3.9642,1.8683,1.1266,1.7735,4.8971,1.343,0.4273,4.0391,2.5659,3.6733,0.0974,2.7533,0.1415,1.0753,2.7016,1.1659,4.2122,1.4921,4.4409,2.6658,0.5473,0.0333,2.6569,2.4155,2.1136,2.736,0.9879,1.4109,5.6098,6.9889,3.3431,1.3471,1.8844,7.0097,1.2608,6.1728,0.5424,4.7271,3.0048,3.0188,5.2825,4.6744,0.9288,0.0148,1.1282,2.3,3.2911,5.9854,1.8273,0.0948,0.6181,3.7911,1.2015,3.8197,4.9028,0.7274,0.4789,3.1823,5.1342,0.0013,5.3931,7.3956,6.4332,8.5856,0.9004]}

Of course, there are many other things in life that contribute towards impact, but being able to give people a voice is what makes me tick. So yeah, I guess I do have aspirations of having a writing career.\n\nSatChat : What kind of impact are you hoping to have on people through writing?\n\nNash : My work focuses on mental health and self-exploration, but the other goal is to create a safe space for people to have those kind of explorations -- without judgment or fear.\n\nSatChat : What was it about writing that you found to be a formative experience that made you want to pursue it as a career?\n\nNash : At this point, that was a very long time ago, and I definitely don't have the same feelings regarding writing that I had when I was a teen. Writing used to be a means to an end, where you needed to produce work in order to complete college and get a job. At this point, writing for me is as meaningful as playing the flute -- it's just something I do because it feels good, and because I feel that I could have an impact when I do it.\n\nSatChat : As a writer, what do you think is most powerful about your work?\n\nNash : It might seem a bit corny, but the thing I love about my work is that it makes people smile. It can be anything from the funny little jokes in my blog, to the poems in my book, to the essay I wrote for the Huffington Post. When I create something and see others getting value out of it, well that's what keeps me writing!","token_len":387,"entropy":[11.5031,6.7244,6.0308,0.4216,1.4212,9.8658,1.411,2.7335,9.3519,1.0292,3.4127,0.7843,2.1703,3.8006,4.4519,2.8134,1.282,1.098,0.9293,0.0028,4.5235,4.825,1.4262,0.6027,3.488,0.1053,4.7185,3.0283,4.3507,1.8793,3.2097,3.9993,0.1377,8.1573,3.6716,6.1512,1.1671,0.0018,3.7458,0.5102,3.0968,3.5151,4.3264,0.522,0.1261,0.6089,0.2475,6.3452,0.0416,0.5449,2.6733,0.454,2.3139,1.7868,1.2876,3.8808,0.4144,0.7679,4.9816,4.798,9.3548,1.7767,0.9645,4.4026,0.3464,0.0006,5.0545,3.4735,1.4737,1.5019,1.3164,3.4454,1.608,1.0846,4.7127,0.321,4.6136,4.887,0.1209,0.7348,4.956,0.8807,4.2312,1.09,2.1774,3.477,3.4786,0.7383,0.7537,0.0255,0.7342,0.5834,0.0001,7.6111,1.8504,0.011,1.743,3.2526,0.0034,3.9855,2.7968,0.1395,2.283,0.45,0.3126,1.55,5.1847,5.9274,2.7813,0.5737,0.2326,0.0001,0.0252,0.0006,0.0144,3.9672,4.0031,6.0243,0.3398,6.7991,0.1883,1.3348,4.1724,0.4124,7.3409,0.0371,1.3559,2.3527,3.982,3.3465,6.1819,0.4239,0.5897,2.7865,1.1598,4.3966,0.755,0.7503,1.0261,0.4012,3.1952,5.5377,4.6556,0.0009,6.0889,0.1858,4.5419,5.414,4.8823,1.4674,2.571,0.7065,1.2517,0.0002,0.2188,0.0178,0.0059,1.5489,3.729,2.0891,3.3793,1.4806,0.3898,2.4716,2.7466,3.5458,0.1141,3.5971,6.2648,1.0067,0.4859,4.7812,2.4013,0.1533,1.8305,0.0171,3.0329,1.8346,3.3569,0.7565,1.8375,0.153,0.1078,0.0001,0.0078,0.0005,0.0136,5.5229,3.4768,0.3477,0.7117,5.9765,2.3792,2.0183,2.9003,3.9089,1.3816,0.1129,1.5695,1.6596,0.655,5.5106,2.8736,0.0003,2.479,2.0152,2.8012,4.5065,5.5522,2.3452,3.3274,0.2296,1.9435,1.5621,0.0887,0.8132,1.8346,3.8499,0.4645,3.7315,8.0987,0.0063,0.2949,1.4236,6.2543,0.7165,1.4007,0.0109,0.6671,4.6441,1.2067,4.707,0.3043,6.7917,4.3756,3.0774,0.3067,0.0416,5.5561,7.8516,2.1864,1.6694,0.9286,0.4707,0.529,4.212,1.3734,0.1493,0.2743,2.3913,4.7418,2.6282,1.866,5.2377,5.6663,0.3938,6.4697,2.6334,8.7952,0.0388,3.9278,2.1812,0.5423,3.0363,2.5713,0.9559,2.4989,3.4486,1.8098,3.2156,1.8557,2.5345,0.6678,3.8222,0.9654,2.1793,2.8366,1.2545,4.0242,2.715,4.0541,0.1503,4.8276,0.2267,3.2788,0.724,0.3533,0.745,0.0002,0.1962,0.0078,0.0045,4.3039,1.4537,1.0456,0.3478,1.0459,2.0497,0.0226,1.8108,2.2515,2.6098,6.3044,0.5874,1.8312,2.1795,0.5318,0.1835,0.0001,0.0056,0.0005,0.0133,2.5882,6.3828,1.6386,3.0479,1.115,5.7107,0.0018,0.8454,0.0816,3.4189,2.8311,1.8861,2.0258,1.0652,2.3127,1.5003,0.1698,0.5291,0.6725,3.9186,2.6895,4.4627,0.8526,1.7401,4.6357,1.1552,5.3354,1.7575,3.0883,5.9954,5.1144,2.4672,3.6444,1.6931,4.5942,1.8542,0.3027,0.6256,7.644,1.2442,0.2667,2.2357,0.8561,0.4293,0.5645,8.084,2.2759,1.2705,1.5171,2.146,3.6435,0.0019,0.4789,4.1234,0.6608,5.1565,1.3338,3.99,4.7337,5.3584,5.2204,8.9598,0.6679,0.0102,0.0647,0.1636,7.4649,3.5711,0.6043,1.7345,4.879,0.3982,5.2099,3.904]}
{"id":759,"ended":true,"length":350,"text":"Koenig Equadoria - A Perfect Summer Car\n\nI'm sure most of you know by now, that the summer is here, and while I love winter time, summer is quite beautiful, and having fun out and about. But let's be honest, driving a car can be so much fun. So, I decided to share a little bit of that fun, in the form of a very stylish and sporty convertible. The Koenig Equadoria makes it one of my favorite summer cars. Koenig also happens to be an Italian company that built this car that I had the immense pleasure and honor of driving recently. But don't just take my word for it; here are some of its features :\n\n1- The body is made from aluminum, which means that it is lightweight and extremely strong.\n\n2- The roof can be lowered in 14 seconds, which means that you can go from being a hot convertible driver to a cold weather fan with just a quick push of a button.\n\n3- The car is equipped with a 5.0L V8 engine, which produces about 534HP. That means that this is a powerful machine.\n\n4- Koenig Equadoria has an amazing design. If it were my car, this is how I would have ordered it: Dark gray with dark blue stripes on the side. I just love the way this car looks.\n\nIt is hard to pick one car to make your summer dream come true, but a Koenig Equadoria might be one of the best cars for this purpose. It is beautiful, fun to drive, and you can go out on any warm summer evening and be one of the hottest drivers out there. But if all this sounds like too good to be true, I don't blame you, but I promise that all of this can be true, all it takes is one test drive.","token_len":387,"entropy":[10.2218,0.7591,11.0431,8.0127,9.2079,3.7717,3.8685,8.8566,13.5183,10.1687,5.96,0.0067,5.0615,2.5048,3.5976,3.7011,0.6245,0.2216,2.1599,2.9305,0.0043,3.7414,1.7209,2.1533,6.4944,2.0023,3.005,1.4734,0.7116,5.1448,2.0914,3.1376,3.9769,5.0159,0.9248,5.207,0.95,5.7383,5.179,2.2093,0.76,6.3538,3.4583,4.9551,4.0583,0.0479,1.9367,3.4627,3.8828,0.3869,2.3352,0.4092,0.4624,8.6897,2.86,0.8115,3.8871,0.4167,4.3834,2.0412,0.7925,1.2489,2.8101,1.9402,2.2218,2.0532,0.1402,4.2759,2.1106,2.1249,2.5841,0.3671,4.0001,1.3094,2.649,3.6989,2.2834,0.5513,0.0031,0.8091,5.2766,7.3237,2.7838,6.7671,0.0227,4.7252,1.0759,2.7613,4.5607,0.001,1.1802,0.0008,0.0078,5.5228,2.2913,5.327,0.3864,1.3353,0.9851,4.4818,1.7211,1.6959,10.1026,0.0026,4.6995,6.4402,0.0014,0.6569,4.3365,3.7173,1.3547,1.3638,5.4709,3.4392,1.1664,5.2315,1.8903,3.9465,3.3319,11.9177,0.1327,5.0215,5.543,0.2764,0.935,7.2231,0.5086,4.6562,4.76,0.0005,4.9596,0.8448,0.3861,0.0133,0.0498,0.0231,3.0261,3.3233,1.3682,0.8201,1.6421,5.6541,2.0491,6.4011,0.802,0.0005,3.2231,4.902,2.7982,4.5878,0.9414,1.9154,1.093,2.9898,1.6235,1.8324,2.1508,1.2498,0.7884,1.6119,3.7709,0.9256,4.6881,3.0413,0.4221,1.3342,0.0002,0.1105,0.0171,0.6299,3.7565,4.5586,0.4855,3.0384,3.7596,8.7899,5.2782,1.2768,1.2723,1.3582,0.5157,1.1817,0.5686,3.123,2.4543,3.8757,1.8347,5.8422,6.7407,5.9643,0.2613,0.9357,3.041,7.2172,7.2008,4.3278,2.079,0.9377,4.963,2.7093,0.3951,0.844,0.0198,0.1838,0.2489,0.0002,0.0496,0.008,0.634,4.02,1.7811,1.7811,0.0106,0.9431,3.676,0.8656,1.2717,2.3552,0.5877,0.9391,1.0695,1.1037,0.3413,4.2882,3.5193,3.6126,6.1086,6.2066,1.31,3.4022,1.847,0.3671,3.1996,2.1737,1.3176,4.3775,3.9617,1.4167,0.5915,0.0002,0.1001,0.0113,3.5228,0.0012,2.2579,0.0011,0.0036,2.5738,2.5817,4.5916,4.8537,1.8574,4.9862,3.6317,2.3303,5.0218,2.435,0.2448,3.173,2.7225,3.3811,0.5526,0.2862,2.6803,6.0868,0.59,2.4314,9.9439,3.7075,2.999,4.0255,2.4281,3.3093,2.4413,0.3546,3.5487,1.2158,2.9658,4.7134,1.7057,1.2055,3.3302,2.0518,0.9935,0.6533,1.1951,1.1454,0.0002,5.5338,1.9582,4.7889,0.1443,4.6752,1.7811,3.0871,2.0065,2.9363,2.9888,2.3626,5.4755,0.5922,0.0026,0.8175,0.6745,4.6472,3.8289,0.0009,0.2599,0.0002,0.0039,4.3312,0.8184,1.5283,0.3402,1.1531,1.2973,3.3274,3.1392,4.2566,3.1785,0.1659,2.345,1.1887,6.1987,0.7299,4.0651,2.5643,0.0708,0.3041,0.3094,3.8368,1.0186,3.7136,2.1233,2.4992,6.1666,5.6649,1.5386,3.4745,1.7156,2.9833,4.26,0.1762,0.1471,3.4697,2.8524,4.4429,0.132,0.2656,3.5788,2.2774,5.7812,4.8737,2.5371,1.3958,2.8239,5.3906,0.1245,0.0569,0.0009,0.115,2.601,2.8426,0.0027,2.7196,0.0053,2.3214,3.9749,1.9811,4.5992,2.3379,5.4259,1.0866,2.6322,3.8888,0.603,3.6259,2.7039,6.795,4.0471,0.5553,0.0891,1.5247,7.822,0.3311,1.6845]}

He also learns that his son had been bullied as a child and that his wife killed and dismembered his father and cut off the limbs of his brother and brother-in-law to use them as a substitute for her hands as she crochets.\n\nThe novel is intended as both a mystery and a psychological thriller. The story is told from the present and the past as the father of the victim recalls his last semester in college, his first weekend home, and his return home to his wife. He begins to realize the extent to which his son was the target of the man\u2019s abuse and begins to wonder if his son might have been the cause of the man\u2019s violence towards him too.","token_len":388,"entropy":[10.5185,0.4221,9.9915,4.9674,7.9806,13.0844,1.4447,3.9905,1.5599,3.0782,2.3976,2.9976,0.6963,0.655,4.455,7.5203,2.6627,2.8934,4.5929,7.8317,3.666,1.8893,1.8295,3.004,1.7072,4.691,0.2432,2.2845,9.8153,3.8247,0.9067,2.2412,1.0062,0.9765,5.1161,3.7898,1.0508,8.5869,0.2472,3.2758,5.0567,2.0818,5.9873,2.1366,8.6851,3.7059,6.9615,4.5016,3.0317,1.2036,2.7903,0.5117,1.5813,0.0149,2.277,4.7692,1.7436,5.9418,2.0331,0.3163,8.6012,3.5247,6.6525,5.4508,2.3716,5.2514,1.9042,3.7963,14.5116,7.5727,3.8784,2.5946,0.6123,1.1376,3.2481,1.1634,3.3911,1.8002,2.2027,2.9434,0.5803,0.0155,0.1474,1.7772,0.0788,0.5627,2.6244,1.6313,5.8082,1.6515,4.0434,3.8612,0.175,1.1521,6.9734,1.6516,2.2224,2.8332,0.0329,0.8689,5.1604,4.0507,1.7584,1.6779,2.1486,6.079,6.2047,0.5472,0.0704,5.3102,1.6874,1.5741,2.9966,5.599,2.7217,6.3186,0.3614,0.5927,2.307,2.7451,0.169,4.961,0.9742,5.0829,0.0482,2.9697,6.8882,2.9327,1.208,0.0002,1.5058,1.1131,2.9425,6.0208,5.1283,0.0525,1.8644,8.0285,3.4744,2.4716,1.2616,1.3013,0.0003,5.4171,0.4736,0.0002,2.8213,6.84,1.6445,5.7818,2.3484,2.3693,5.7072,6.7343,0.5668,2.3951,0.4155,3.492,3.249,3.2854,5.9467,2.5069,5.3186,0.7598,4.961,3.9269,6.3325,6.4204,1.8252,4.2802,4.0616,4.8244,5.9114,3.2573,0.3988,4.2998,6.8649,0.0017,0.3814,6.1516,0.2779,1.329,5.6327,2.092,4.491,1.4135,2.5049,6.7492,4.4114,6.7409,3.1935,1.5352,3.7686,0.2021,1.2041,2.3011,2.7617,1.8403,1.3818,3.3819,0.8475,2.6642,2.2981,5.5527,0.7494,0.7177,4.8585,7.7249,0.0044,3.7286,1.5011,1.305,0.362,1.3507,7.8051,2.598,4.3126,0.3162,0.6097,1.3893,0.1641,2.824,1.6154,5.3579,0.2762,1.9842,4.8427,8.1204,1.8142,0.9829,5.3373,4.577,1.4535,0.8935,4.3447,1.586,3.3913,1.0245,2.4865,1.0475,0.3547,3.2374,3.6855,2.0953,0.377,0.812,1.0242,3.4319,1.3446,4.571,3.659,0.1809,0.5037,1.2617,1.2733,1.4867,6.1555,5.3458,6.072,5.302,0.2768,0.0,2.2079,2.1108,2.8488,8.0775,0.6425,3.1323,5.9646,0.1985,0.5713,4.1952,1.9232,3.8591,1.445,0.0042,0.002,0.0037,3.5323,5.0499,3.1919,0.7788,1.6511,4.8446,0.3715,5.2537,5.9929,4.5248,2.1739,12.4874,4.1675,3.4528,2.9527,1.2453,0.0002,1.8124,4.1824,1.5732,4.595,1.0006,6.0489,0.3325,1.8702,0.2817,0.4438,4.9043,0.1623,0.3744,1.7336,2.6042,1.4594,1.7013,2.2209,0.8199,8.674,2.3354,1.6274,1.4803,2.9052,1.8716,4.2099,2.383,1.3785,4.5493,5.9606,0.6593,4.3715,9.206,2.3406,0.3253,1.7065,2.2167,2.6201,6.3524,5.0291,1.8428,1.0518,0.7313,6.0868,1.2515,1.283,1.3665,3.7736,1.7974,2.6605,3.4933,0.326,2.5978,2.9965,4.5471,1.458,0.0041,0.5731,0.9048,2.389,3.7792,3.9959,0.104,2.588,5.7567,5.5956,0.0536,0.1089,3.2051,1.0269,4.3996,0.1436,3.2043,1.107,1.3227,1.0746,3.063,0.8847,0.7493,1.8164,3.95,0.3406,1.3823,4.5232,0.2829,0.0059,0.0132,3.3061,4.5843,0.5689,7.8689,0.1403]}

Except you have no idea exactly what you are supposed to be'regulating ', and it slowly becomes apparent that neither do any of your co-workers.\n\nThe System is a new card game created by Richard Garfield (Legendary Studios founder, designer of MtG). It will feature artwork by Jim Lee, co-creator of the X-Men and Batman. It will have a set-up similar to the Arkham Games (i.e. the investigator has a mission to complete and must face multiple foes in the process). There will be two different versions, a solo and a two-player version.\n\nSet-up: Players are either one of three roles: The Hero, The Villain, or The Regulator. The Hero is an individual who is doing their job as a regulator fairly and is in charge of tracking down a villain known as the System. Players take turns taking out the System's minions until the Villain and the Hero meet in the heart of the city. At this point, if there are any surviving minions, the Villain must be taken out to end the game.\n\nThe Hero can spend experience points to learn new tricks, like making a villain give up their loot before shooting the bag, or making a villain believe that one of their minions is the System. However, if the Hero spends more than his ability points, he will fail. If the Hero fails, the villain can still win if their minions outnumber the Hero's minions.\n\nThe Villain is a baddie attempting to do bad things. They typically want to gain access to the System to complete their evil-doings (such as getting the next hit in their villainy). If the Villain spends more than their ability points, they will fail. They can still win by outnumbering the heroes, if so many are left.","token_len":390,"entropy":[9.538,4.62,10.1048,7.0808,1.1994,1.8008,6.7564,8.901,1.0866,2.6102,5.2628,0.7997,0.4995,6.9138,5.3252,8.5692,1.8283,2.284,2.1279,2.3562,6.3346,0.601,0.7483,1.1313,3.2578,0.0007,2.0204,13.7017,8.5075,7.073,15.1896,1.8528,3.4932,9.4247,2.2829,1.4132,0.4455,6.9954,5.7062,4.6231,0.2106,1.9064,5.6631,0.3123,0.3003,0.5027,2.0945,0.243,2.3103,2.8897,1.9267,3.6157,5.1192,8.4895,0.3747,3.9726,0.302,6.1332,4.0066,3.5001,8.9728,5.2238,6.7845,1.6898,3.7952,2.7722,11.1857,0.8886,3.7564,1.5602,4.5491,3.2162,8.7399,0.8636,5.7919,4.6765,1.0415,6.2803,0.0174,0.78,0.1315,1.5231,5.7903,0.3914,0.5809,1.951,4.4196,2.4559,2.0258,1.1457,3.6368,1.6626,5.1889,4.7482,0.4585,3.9029,0.0069,1.4801,5.4709,4.6507,4.868,6.4774,0.133,0.0002,0.5267,2.1792,11.567,4.5197,2.3461,5.7699,0.7828,6.3551,3.2625,6.104,5.1855,4.5852,3.937,2.0158,2.1421,5.1624,1.3487,3.5474,0.9794,0.3494,3.3898,2.8791,3.9,2.6856,3.7103,7.3374,0.9954,0.483,5.2107,0.3512,0.1501,2.7246,0.4381,1.262,0.0002,7.3157,2.5453,0.3424,1.5348,4.0754,3.2598,5.4666,5.188,0.6806,2.0305,5.2091,1.1874,3.7794,6.8119,1.1025,2.7316,3.7204,0.0061,0.612,0.5288,0.5723,6.8396,0.0059,0.1986,1.3563,0.7598,1.4396,3.6365,3.5031,0.9077,2.1457,6.3477,2.2991,1.6548,2.4973,1.0114,6.5498,11.3249,5.5045,3.085,4.1204,0.6268,0.0491,6.5503,0.2977,3.9794,3.1726,6.2398,0.2604,0.7868,5.606,0.6429,4.862,4.0125,1.4156,3.3865,4.4531,1.5476,0.6457,0.8776,2.2695,6.1868,1.5117,5.2958,0.0095,3.8332,0.565,2.0463,3.9414,2.087,1.4125,6.9627,0.0085,0.3934,3.2519,0.6132,4.9948,2.221,0.1073,0.6462,4.552,3.1315,1.2157,1.602,5.9588,1.7631,1.1491,1.1966,3.243,0.0046,2.4535,2.7944,4.9767,0.9561,2.368,5.3901,0.1464,1.2026,0.3747,1.3247,0.0002,1.1871,1.5365,5.4103,6.5769,6.5806,0.2839,0.5949,4.4231,1.691,3.4244,1.4408,3.9416,4.4967,1.7582,6.4084,6.5783,1.208,2.4733,7.2738,5.0223,6.9515,2.2108,11.1249,2.0225,0.6066,3.7902,1.1678,0.6701,6.236,1.1472,4.9196,0.4746,1.0431,1.1071,1.1672,2.5216,0.6583,1.0456,4.9232,0.0405,2.04,0.6536,0.5119,5.4629,2.1113,1.6135,4.4306,6.792,1.337,0.7586,1.3042,1.7281,4.1981,2.0856,1.9605,0.6519,0.1545,2.7873,0.837,0.9779,3.634,3.2207,4.171,3.6445,4.8779,4.497,2.6312,7.6758,0.9815,0.7103,1.3978,1.4451,2.4795,0.6497,0.9353,0.0002,0.8864,1.1594,0.0006,1.5324,1.5085,6.5527,3.1292,7.3363,0.0607,4.8281,5.724,0.5634,1.6039,2.8801,6.8675,4.8468,0.3317,5.4715,3.3544,0.0168,1.3679,1.2958,3.3226,4.3493,0.4974,3.9166,5.7041,0.3065,0.1351,4.1391,3.6122,0.003,4.1469,2.3345,7.7533,5.2388,3.3331,2.893,5.6567,3.4569,0.9735,2.6064,0.6257,0.6189,0.0011,4.1458,0.7037,0.0949,1.695,0.1589,0.0819,0.2471,0.9022,0.9524,2.2245,0.5386,4.1122,1.4909,2.7296,0.1893,3.9806,6.2644,3.0235,0.0009,0.3135,5.7636,1.8555,3.655,5.4789,3.0458,3.9138,2.0496,1.3305]}

And I apologize for the late replies -- I've been on a cruise this week.)","token_len":390,"entropy":[12.3945,5.8104,1.5682,7.2725,0.0004,3.4019,11.0691,2.7318,9.7857,3.3142,1.7101,6.4356,3.2653,0.8505,1.3432,11.6941,4.5276,5.7227,3.0101,4.7069,8.287,0.0479,1.0042,6.6621,2.8361,4.0194,0.8332,3.7835,0.1075,6.876,4.8135,4.2946,0.0427,3.6427,1.6671,0.0415,0.6027,1.5106,7.1953,3.0097,6.9259,3.1054,0.0004,0.0003,2.2345,4.2655,3.5503,7.7899,9.6533,5.63,0.2112,0.3993,6.5251,4.8244,0.084,9.2963,5.6842,2.501,0.0064,0.0284,0.0248,0.001,0.2664,0.0052,3.1439,9.3755,5.5432,2.8932,5.6659,1.6893,4.286,4.8951,4.0802,1.5808,2.3107,6.5674,3.0681,1.1989,4.7547,1.7603,6.7323,8.2024,0.0035,5.18,0.0973,1.8384,8.778,4.0767,4.5862,2.2092,3.4829,3.482,5.8832,0.9006,0.6269,3.4313,0.2358,0.0075,0.0897,0.0523,0.0031,6.3981,0.3261,5.6149,7.4528,0.3336,2.4251,7.2317,5.7346,4.546,6.6584,5.9237,1.9018,4.6097,2.6782,1.3823,4.71,3.6673,13.2933,4.0354,4.6303,0.0321,0.0003,0.5516,2.26,5.5571,3.607,6.2671,2.2203,6.8914,9.4386,4.0804,4.7274,4.4184,6.3125,0.9535,5.4157,1.7738,0.0013,4.8468,0.3964,0.4268,1.1679,0.7942,1.4417,0.8095,2.4427,3.3271,4.9131,4.0944,0.1953,2.8196,1.3792,4.1375,2.0669,2.0182,0.0583,0.007,0.0819,0.0571,0.0038,0.1953,0.0653,3.6061,4.0266,3.4902,1.3412,6.3338,1.2673,3.5739,1.0722,1.7396,3.749,4.3555,5.0801,3.4825,7.1736,0.1625,0.0044,4.3922,2.2884,3.7742,3.8687,2.8238,3.6813,0.7021,5.1103,12.152,3.4405,2.0702,5.6699,0.658,5.8651,2.8894,2.4351,4.5573,0.0009,2.6174,1.3316,4.3024,3.2461,3.589,3.4267,5.3972,0.9809,0.9778,7.7704,2.9677,3.9609,0.5086,1.6382,2.5996,3.9543,1.9506,3.4302,3.3646,3.9639,3.8538,0.0022,4.458,0.4579,6.8286,2.7485,4.408,1.7383,2.5504,3.1046,0.0064,0.7337,2.5039,1.9064,4.9103,1.0644,0.5403,1.3501,4.8403,1.8885,5.6862,1.677,3.0772,4.4209,1.9397,5.8624,5.0699,2.8946,2.6034,0.8266,2.5315,1.3512,0.8908,1.5705,4.4669,0.5054,4.979,3.0928,1.0338,2.1873,4.0667,5.2134,4.2314,7.4928,1.7269,4.6061,1.1574,2.4536,0.8198,4.4615,0.6324,3.8126,2.9069,1.2046,6.0997,4.5676,3.5763,1.8452,3.2576,0.0267,1.4474,2.9241,5.9137,2.4129,5.7317,3.8529,6.5468,0.0012,7.1027,6.0161,1.604,1.6122,0.9906,1.433,6.4056,2.0984,0.5254,1.2956,0.4847,1.5334,3.3526,3.0033,5.1512,0.5737,1.5495,9.1705,6.0213,2.0139,1.7212,0.1673,2.385,1.8261,5.6727,3.1501,2.4618,1.204,2.9187,0.8589,0.9316,4.9489,3.5141,2.9769,3.7606,0.4207,0.0093,0.147,5.2203,4.2283,2.7053,1.6267,6.1488,0.3155,0.7065,1.909,4.0483,2.0194,0.4297,2.0917,5.6228,5.0753,3.8273,5.2279,5.263,1.0201,5.4475,2.4609,4.7403,6.0636,1.9701,1.5939,4.1053,2.3938,1.5146,0.8461,0.103,4.479,0.5455,2.2217,5.3127,1.9889,0.9842,1.3895,3.8427,1.0345,5.4126,1.8505,0.4729,6.0112,5.572,0.3323,0.6439,3.6062,1.9544,2.013,0.8116,3.0512,2.6679,4.8419,0.7118,1.3643,5.6033,6.5183,4.0262,1.1404,3.3447,1.6481,4.1054,2.1312,6.4209,3.422,1.6596,3.1663]}

I don't know which it was. ''\n\n-- Robin Williams, ''Patch Adams'' (1998)\n\nCAMPAIGNING FOR A DIFFICULT CAUSE\n\nIt may seem strange to Americans, but in Europe it's common to have a medical-legal system of sorts, in which the courts and doctors play different roles. In Switzerland, if you're caught drunk driving, you get a fine. If you're caught buying drugs and use them, you're put in prison. On Jan. 4, 1999, a similar system was put into effect in Germany, where patients had the choice of going to a doctor to get permission to die or to have an ``aid to die.'' In Sweden, a doctor must provide the patient with the medicine to kill himself.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1992 Compassion and Choices decision, it is legal for physicians and other doctors who don't practice medicine for a living to ask a patient with a terminal illness whether he wants or does not want to have an assisted suicide. But in the United States it is still considered illegal for a physician to provide the lethal drug to the patient -- a physician who actually practices medicine.\n\nIn Switzerland, an organization called Dignitas is the first to take advantage of this 1992 decision, which was hailed as being a step forward in promoting assisted suicide. Dignitas is not a suicide pact, but rather an organization that takes seriously its mission to allow the terminally ill and the mentally ill to end their lives legally by lethal injections. The law states that Dignitas can legally provide the lethal doses and that the patients must be able to pay their expenses (which may include a travel fee of 200 Swiss francs).","token_len":391,"entropy":[5.1634,3.7704,4.6437,9.5066,2.9602,2.0418,4.4864,0.7462,1.0307,3.9941,0.9545,5.887,2.6774,2.2152,0.0005,7.4548,0.4346,1.1564,1.4146,0.0965,0.4917,1.326,0.2642,0.6167,0.0002,1.8404,6.4845,0.1066,0.3496,7.8628,0.9324,7.2533,3.1909,2.3131,4.7979,2.3557,2.7881,1.1062,1.205,2.8211,0.0006,1.7381,5.1766,5.1553,1.6589,0.7498,9.8542,2.5021,0.026,5.1354,7.9684,2.2343,1.3834,2.6811,12.6376,6.3712,0.6705,2.1262,5.4208,0.3448,0.4897,0.0002,5.7368,6.0007,2.2552,6.8231,5.4221,3.9742,3.3733,3.5632,4.4757,0.0593,0.0106,8.0733,0.5206,0.6969,0.0002,3.9083,3.9581,1.4293,2.455,1.0139,6.3134,1.9185,0.5577,3.2247,5.6204,3.2916,0.9739,3.3549,1.1924,2.9819,1.4599,6.0182,4.9115,3.8286,3.6984,3.2654,3.8232,1.7231,3.4543,0.1154,1.9889,3.8043,2.885,2.7405,5.3012,6.9851,0.1736,0.7601,1.9783,5.2703,0.4112,6.1209,1.0231,1.8006,4.4251,5.4101,1.9223,0.6849,0.7414,3.1204,1.1056,2.3854,2.1485,3.055,0.158,0.8058,2.0424,5.1945,1.1089,2.7267,5.7353,0.5304,1.5888,0.2905,2.1157,5.0081,1.2533,2.053,0.4842,5.2942,8.4478,0.0051,3.4832,0.1544,3.4001,0.0501,1.7904,6.8288,2.2969,0.8762,2.4953,1.3497,1.0611,0.2572,2.1644,0.9771,1.0635,6.0347,3.4002,3.1713,3.3164,0.7362,4.0793,0.3868,1.7825,2.0559,3.2157,1.1617,7.1673,0.2669,6.1171,2.2201,1.5182,3.0589,3.3122,11.5031,7.3317,3.0207,3.1094,2.0427,2.4698,4.9232,0.1075,2.6227,1.4394,3.797,4.0174,2.2127,1.3696,0.1128,2.9682,3.9621,2.6996,2.8401,1.7301,0.9961,1.3343,0.0002,5.2878,0.0059,1.3414,3.2775,0.0005,0.1873,0.06,3.5343,0.0048,2.3773,4.6881,9.247,0.5428,4.6742,4.1418,0.0007,0.5755,0.5844,3.9472,1.3939,3.4724,1.1663,4.3447,2.6013,1.6926,3.3886,3.3582,5.5442,0.0014,2.7399,1.5345,5.8001,2.3134,4.9453,0.1308,5.0646,3.2083,0.9509,5.7131,0.986,3.5464,0.1193,3.9208,0.749,1.7241,4.3301,4.5795,0.0236,0.1293,0.313,2.5821,0.7981,2.3105,0.3025,0.4531,2.7075,2.4321,1.9262,1.1513,0.0921,4.6125,1.2935,4.5571,4.4983,1.9132,1.7313,1.406,1.1747,0.4201,4.0309,2.4497,5.6958,2.8141,1.2342,2.769,0.6014,5.3553,2.6329,4.971,1.4777,6.0738,5.6039,0.5807,2.1669,0.8121,0.0002,1.8643,3.9269,0.1364,4.4275,5.6928,0.2373,4.6094,1.2497,2.7335,3.6086,2.9527,1.9661,3.9071,3.781,0.0071,1.2408,11.7606,1.197,1.378,1.2558,3.6449,4.7107,0.3909,5.2647,1.4879,2.7417,1.79,0.9206,5.8213,5.2383,0.0596,0.5146,2.0686,0.001,1.9307,3.7854,1.4897,5.3588,6.0386,0.8595,0.6338,1.2777,2.1656,1.3541,0.8549,3.9431,3.397,2.7527,3.7053,0.8639,5.8862,2.969,3.6121,0.0021,0.0018,3.7889,2.8246,2.1283,0.0498,0.3236,3.4284,0.1629,0.7985,6.7566,3.1489,8.2221,5.3856,0.5407,2.3415,5.0509,2.6577,0.1876,6.3393,0.0004,3.1641,4.3324,2.1091,2.3008,1.1469,5.4204,3.6251,2.6235,1.8857,3.4062,2.025,1.4104,2.9322,0.0069,3.7946,3.8689,4.2511,4.8182,3.3548,3.2963,0.5818,3.0186,6.0518,3.174,4.6481,5.6826,1.9998,0.1991,0.0026,2.0255]}

A mistake has been made and you are now in the body of a highly important historical figure and have 24 hours to not change the future.\n\nThe History :\n\nYou have discovered how to travel back into the past, so the world is happy about it and decides to use it for their good. The problem is that when you travel back into the past you do not have an external reference frame, so the world you came from does not exist for you anymore and everything that was, is, and will happen in that universe is outside your consciousness because by definition it never was, is not, and will not be. This problem only happens for the consciousness travelling back in time but the other persons present in that universe and everything around them will be unaffected. Now to prevent people from making mistakes you must stay out of the public eye. As the scientist you travel a lot and make lots of notes on time travel physics and relativity, but you are always thinking that if you are caught you have a secret which would make all time travel impossible. One day while you are travelling you make a mistake and accidentally become the person you know and love today. You want to leave this person in the past and be able to live in the future. How should you go? Do you try to kill that person or what?\n\nThe Science :\n\nBecause you are a conscious person it must take you time to travel to the past in order not being affected.

He just didn't have the chops.","token_len":393,"entropy":[7.8911,4.8062,4.8771,4.595,13.721,4.4177,0.8445,4.0245,4.1837,0.2496,2.2596,0.693,6.8737,0.8215,1.0854,0.0341,0.602,5.0567,4.6274,6.4785,4.5892,4.8534,0.9412,3.0267,2.6942,4.5561,4.1113,8.2939,0.0933,3.4218,0.1348,2.739,6.5738,0.6355,1.2302,0.2618,1.3106,3.6555,4.4651,5.7607,7.6285,1.8049,3.0177,1.9486,3.0367,9.1505,4.557,1.4126,0.527,3.1996,4.1248,4.8642,2.8633,3.0835,1.7656,1.7468,4.1144,1.85,2.6162,1.6451,5.1375,5.3349,3.1349,2.382,4.2541,1.0174,3.1626,6.8414,0.3267,1.8541,1.0147,5.2573,4.4969,2.3821,0.7857,2.1021,2.6294,5.31,9.9051,0.0094,4.1476,0.0005,3.9627,8.0176,0.7787,5.8821,0.3091,1.4109,4.639,2.9913,3.621,1.8388,2.2986,3.1135,4.8936,0.0275,7.912,1.8281,0.8675,1.1986,6.4848,1.6918,0.3051,0.6594,2.0223,2.8536,4.1662,4.7943,1.7338,1.2822,1.6885,4.6958,0.8698,5.542,3.4077,1.6827,6.8291,5.6843,5.5911,9.7125,2.4694,1.2337,0.0002,7.809,0.0041,0.0972,0.0041,1.5535,0.621,0.0297,0.0252,0.2595,0.046,0.0006,0.0035,0.0102,0.002,0.0007,0.0003,0.0006,0.003,0.0048,0.0018,0.0015,0.0016,0.0021,0.0007,0.0012,0.0013,0.0003,0.0014,0.0052,0.0004,0.0013,0.001,0.004,0.0035,0.0006,0.0006,0.0019,0.0016,0.0042,0.0015,0.0046,0.0005,0.0008,0.0062,0.0016,0.0046,0.0587,0.0116,0.9941,0.0001,1.4938,0.0761,0.0126,0.0023,0.0185,0.0007,0.0063,0.0077,0.0006,0.0009,0.0017,0.0012,0.0022,0.0006,0.0029,0.0026,0.0034,0.001,0.0001,0.0004,0.0062,0.0005,0.0238,0.0135,0.018,0.0011,0.0023,0.0035,0.0009,0.0016,0.0001,0.0016,0.0002,0.0022,0.0035,0.003,0.0013,0.0073,0.0019,0.0008,0.0006,0.002,0.0006,0.0024,0.0013,0.0018,0.0012,0.0005,0.0018,0.0006,0.0007,0.0018,0.0002,0.0012,0.0008,0.0025,0.0009,0.0025,0.0005,0.001,0.0008,0.0026,0.0006,0.0011,0.0025,0.0002,0.0015,0.0013,0.0037,0.0044,0.0004,0.001,0.2493,0.0001,2.2218,0.0022,0.035,0.0014,0.1452,0.0494,0.0056,0.0037,0.0445,0.0226,0.0005,0.0063,0.002,0.0031,0.0011,0.0003,0.0012,0.0014,0.0063,0.0038,0.0024,0.0019,0.0017,0.0011,0.0019,0.0016,0.0002,0.0013,0.007,0.0006,0.0013,0.0011,0.0053,0.0055,0.001,0.0009,0.0025,0.0022,0.0051,0.0025,0.0083,0.0008,0.0011,0.0043,0.002,0.0051,0.1751,0.0107,0.0743,0.0001,0.8234,0.1383,0.0189,0.0026,0.0217,0.0009,0.0051,0.0144,0.0013,0.0013,0.0018,0.0022,0.0031,0.0008,0.0053,0.002,0.0035,0.0013,0.0001,0.0004,0.0124,0.0005,0.0137,0.0171,0.0351,0.0016,0.0042,0.0008,0.0015,0.0037,0.0003,0.0016,0.0001,0.0029,0.0064,0.0062,0.0018,0.0052,0.0015,0.0006,0.0004,0.0014,0.001,0.0039,0.0009,0.0023,0.0009,0.0003,0.0018,0.0004,0.0004,0.0036,0.0004,0.001,0.0013,0.0016,0.0014,0.0025,0.0009,0.0016,0.0005,0.0024,0.0007,0.0008,0.0024,0.0003,0.0015,0.0009,0.0044,0.0074,0.0006,0.0013,0.0959,0.0001,7.542,4.1373,5.5961,4.5572,0.457,2.4903,5.5069,8.6478,5.7033,2.1072,6.1458,1.261,1.6223,2.1366,4.1887,2.1505,0.0019,1.4206,0.4865,4.1529,2.8177]}
{"id":3519,"ended":true,"length":365,"text":"The Wandering City by Sarah Pekkanen\n\nI\u2019m a bit surprised by this, because I didn\u2019t have any expectations. It\u2019s just a pretty, lovely book, that happens to be about a lot of things I like (science, language, literature). It\u2019s a story about a young woman, Elisa, who lives in a new apartment complex in a little, city on the coast of Southern France\u2026 and one day she wakes up in a different city! And then another. One day she wakes up in a hotel in Japan, and it\u2019s all very strange to her. And it really seems like you\u2019re always in a hotel. It\u2019s not a typical book about moving house, or about being unsettled in a new place. Elisa is sort of in a mental state where she really doesn\u2019t care where she is, but she has to try to do the things she would normally do, or at least learn what they are. Then one day she realises she\u2019s in her home city, not in the one where she lives. She goes home, but what\u2019s more fun than having an adventure in a foreign city? Anyway, you can guess the story from there. I really enjoyed being so completely lost in Elisa\u2019s world, and learning about how people move around the world, and maybe that\u2019s why at the end of the book (like in a game), the next place she wakes up in is her home city again. It worked quite nicely. A nice, simple book.\n\nThere\u2019s a scene towards the end of the book which is basically a kind of self-examination as to how much of your life do you live, and how much of it is someone else\u2019s? It was beautifully written, and I thought it was well done and very moving.","token_len":393,"entropy":[11.3127,1.7796,5.1249,5.3924,6.9398,4.8837,5.7717,6.3688,2.1642,1.4015,0.0273,3.9515,15.267,8.0964,2.9545,2.4387,3.8894,3.182,2.0638,1.458,2.9406,2.0341,1.1291,3.5719,3.1625,1.0618,0.2626,3.7851,1.7668,4.054,2.3805,2.8119,3.5767,0.0413,1.2417,3.2968,1.6276,4.687,4.5284,6.2886,2.0394,1.6266,4.2613,7.211,0.0186,0.5429,2.0706,1.6608,4.9067,0.0452,1.4725,2.9898,3.732,4.3183,6.9923,0.5665,6.2423,0.118,3.7396,2.5604,1.6848,1.775,0.0357,0.0077,1.8405,4.1494,0.6742,1.2394,2.6947,1.7781,2.7643,7.2277,2.7969,0.7419,0.3616,3.9788,0.4911,0.8643,6.4188,3.6548,3.9111,1.7996,2.0299,5.034,5.1506,6.0631,4.438,0.4768,3.1758,0.4102,6.2328,3.1145,6.8142,2.1985,5.0758,0.5602,1.6256,3.1681,0.0114,1.5464,0.9018,4.6394,1.6825,5.7548,2.605,3.114,5.6218,2.4488,5.1778,0.6482,0.9187,2.5773,0.0137,0.2915,0.6359,5.3443,1.8914,6.7965,0.9722,0.8603,3.4901,3.7199,0.0665,0.0023,3.7832,3.9945,2.8614,4.8873,1.2708,0.8384,1.4253,2.8795,4.4879,3.7247,0.9575,4.3464,3.9064,0.067,1.4185,4.8777,3.0775,1.8563,3.0061,2.3582,2.3482,1.9991,0.0075,0.0157,3.2755,2.6459,4.2637,5.2704,2.9484,6.9484,6.6808,0.8605,3.0513,2.801,3.0817,10.4975,0.0001,2.3138,1.0779,1.3291,1.3774,0.867,5.6986,0.0005,1.2511,5.3366,0.04,3.236,1.0684,7.3952,1.5961,3.3723,0.419,4.8623,1.5484,0.5772,0.1225,0.011,3.3751,3.7806,0.3041,0.967,1.1819,2.4469,1.0172,2.9308,1.586,4.5112,1.1896,4.1672,2.8165,1.8487,0.6927,6.678,1.6902,0.2194,1.5284,3.1448,2.3925,0.0472,4.9695,3.1679,3.7261,1.3851,1.2556,5.2969,3.1545,0.0586,0.6118,9.0441,0.0472,1.6278,3.61,0.0222,0.134,2.4468,4.2584,5.4014,2.5751,1.0009,5.6256,1.9841,2.142,4.6779,2.4705,0.3031,2.1497,1.1569,2.1344,2.5135,4.2277,1.5643,2.9615,5.021,4.2318,0.0954,0.9381,6.7805,5.7559,2.896,3.6743,3.8325,4.7291,1.6491,0.952,3.2247,0.9001,1.2257,5.2175,0.1459,4.2543,2.5692,5.9672,2.6876,2.3233,4.3315,1.8942,0.5749,2.5722,2.5939,2.0426,6.0742,5.6624,5.8699,5.2255,0.7201,4.3936,0.0019,2.849,0.0077,0.1511,2.2399,1.0099,0.9277,6.5319,1.401,3.2919,2.9122,4.3462,1.3837,2.333,0.327,1.3155,0.8568,6.0417,3.8977,2.0636,0.0044,0.8113,2.3505,7.9026,1.2474,0.1902,0.4538,0.3401,0.7009,4.6713,5.3248,2.0686,4.0011,5.9516,2.2951,2.9942,6.046,5.7801,0.8103,3.0364,0.0214,0.9925,0.5252,3.9647,2.652,0.702,5.8204,0.7414,2.1242,6.8475,3.9037,3.5378,1.3867,5.2903,4.5759,2.279,3.3546,2.8383,1.5507,0.9721,0.0006,4.8048,3.1381,0.0281,0.0899,1.4293,4.9435,9.7965,0.0075,0.0191,1.1695,0.3251,0.3809,4.5214,1.4768,5.1616,1.4402,4.5355,0.003,6.8694,0.2196,4.7756,5.5684,1.0647,1.6018,3.0853,2.3686,3.7549,0.8493,7.7736,0.0502,2.9605,1.7684,0.8639,0.7982,0.2948,1.1212,1.5168,1.1747,8.9414,0.3572,1.6025,0.0396,0.2137,6.7454,2.5774,2.6121,7.6485,0.7964,0.9957,0.8202,1.7076,3.5643,0.527,0.5879,4.6375,1.1515,3.6343,3.5091,3.4912,0.4331]}

Let's search the hill \".\n\nYou can either believe or disbelieve the Robbers.\n\nYou can choose to tell the truth and climb the hill, in which case the robbers give you the treasure bag.\n\nor\n\nYou can choose to lie to the Robbers and leave the treasure... and trust the Robbers.\n\nIf you trust them, they will guide you back safely up the hill, but if you lie to them, they will make their way home and wait for you at home, giving you no warning you are in danger : they don't care if you die of thirst, starvation, thirst, being attacked... only of the Robbers taking away their treasure.\n\nOnce you are at the top of the hill and the Robbers realise you were right about them, they will start to trust you, and tell you things... you will have to decide whether you trust these people too!","token_len":394,"entropy":[9.6923,2.0834,8.8417,13.2249,8.2435,4.5849,2.2786,5.1066,5.5965,4.6473,0.5027,5.9609,9.1086,0.8917,5.8383,6.5499,1.3757,7.6402,7.1942,9.5772,1.418,3.2978,3.2745,2.8227,1.1136,4.7177,0.4753,1.2545,5.9375,5.686,0.5115,1.9499,2.1239,5.8406,3.8744,1.9486,7.0931,3.5457,5.2647,0.9112,4.4385,0.3784,6.2663,1.4635,0.4882,1.5437,2.2977,2.9362,11.2716,0.6373,3.075,0.8381,1.4107,0.4142,1.4791,1.2656,11.2915,3.0833,6.2997,0.2673,5.3935,4.2188,3.2683,0.0432,7.0446,0.6743,4.6969,5.3179,4.0239,6.2571,1.8826,1.6146,6.0682,3.5375,4.1975,0.5289,0.4879,3.1114,4.4189,1.3075,0.3015,0.9432,5.2083,0.5556,0.288,1.0754,6.0994,4.3705,0.1676,3.7106,5.9929,0.5274,1.9827,3.8273,1.1051,4.2531,0.0979,4.2243,2.8572,0.0165,3.6732,3.7497,3.6962,4.6243,3.6696,3.3595,1.072,1.3409,2.0558,6.0262,7.2699,1.7079,1.4037,1.521,1.7943,0.084,2.1149,2.9598,2.73,3.378,4.6951,1.9655,5.4357,1.5409,4.0648,4.5933,3.3283,3.4564,1.9196,7.0746,1.4447,0.7072,0.0471,1.5419,1.5183,0.0002,4.8636,1.4057,2.8192,0.2398,2.9129,2.7713,6.8182,5.8794,5.347,1.9623,1.6576,8.5878,0.4421,0.3201,4.1732,3.108,2.44,2.9316,0.6386,0.5201,0.8747,2.1073,1.643,1.9188,0.0002,4.5022,4.1437,3.4801,0.0899,3.3658,0.2935,4.0528,4.0914,0.6402,3.2247,0.6262,2.5504,4.6097,8.1427,1.4166,2.304,4.3759,3.3434,6.1109,5.8118,3.4544,3.1363,0.5496,0.2392,4.8801,3.5031,4.0584,4.4043,1.5708,0.6355,1.8069,3.5991,2.8848,3.9687,1.7194,3.0352,3.6072,3.4358,6.7681,0.4601,1.4785,4.703,6.0124,1.4725,4.5815,0.355,6.343,2.0031,1.5851,10.0345,0.8387,0.0003,2.9335,1.0806,4.9061,5.7316,3.2314,1.1244,0.0003,1.4364,0.2757,0.0588,1.1974,1.095,0.0002,2.9207,0.5881,4.055,0.8104,4.0939,0.8658,6.3341,3.1111,8.5654,0.2696,0.0813,1.8199,5.2763,1.8584,0.032,1.1819,2.3,5.196,0.2473,1.2349,1.8357,8.7242,1.043,0.6532,0.0002,6.4271,4.1219,0.0001,0.5961,0.199,2.7039,0.1007,1.4362,0.6427,0.2165,0.3144,0.0073,0.4058,4.3107,1.5207,0.8685,3.9863,2.406,1.1992,0.19,0.0048,0.0077,0.1967,0.2463,0.0002,3.2216,0.2566,4.6904,1.6798,0.5839,2.3726,1.1872,7.5625,0.0598,4.17,6.8499,3.532,0.3854,0.1193,2.0079,2.9006,1.0157,0.2433,2.9044,0.5885,0.3069,0.539,0.5176,0.6572,4.1532,4.7177,1.8718,5.054,2.07,5.8635,0.3139,0.1902,3.5628,3.7945,2.7369,5.1889,0.1285,4.1872,3.8412,4.8585,2.2452,3.1484,0.9618,9.1779,5.6556,3.4898,0.001,1.6631,1.9754,0.2006,4.8572,4.4814,2.0579,1.4866,5.0421,0.6147,4.3642,0.8973,7.6792,4.2427,4.1892,6.1036,6.5087,2.7773,5.3876,0.09,6.336,3.6258,2.2785,0.9406,0.6244,0.4754,0.0002,5.668,0.3436,2.8832,3.416,0.962,1.2344,0.3736,0.1074,0.0743,2.987,2.0822,1.1245,0.016,7.4574,0.4608,4.264,4.0991,2.4729,3.3561,0.6015,0.7315,1.2607,4.3825,1.9623,7.0309,0.0636,2.0607,1.0674,3.1243,0.0969,4.1896,5.2734,3.4186,2.3351,2.8402,1.1763,4.3753,2.1607,1.3105,1.7023,5.4136,1.3051,5.3447,5.3427]}

{"id":3240,"ended":true,"length":380,"text":"Tell me About the Day Death Died.\n\nThe book is about a little orphan boy, who goes to live with an old, rich widow who has an army of ghostly servants that she uses in her home, and she is an expert in the occult. The book is set in England in the early 1900's. The story starts with Mrs. O'Conner (whom she takes care of). There are a lot of little things that tell and help along the storyline of the book. There are hints of things that her house is not normal. One of the things that the ghost of death does in her house.\n\nThe ghost of death is not as friendly as the Ghost of Christmas Past or the Ghost of Christmas Present. He wants to be a good ghost and he likes to do fun things like make people dream or get lost in his home but in Mrs. O'Conner's place, all he wants to do is find a way to get rid of her. He has a plan to make sure that she is no longer there. Then one night in the house, he makes the mistake of killing her.\n\nSo one night when the little boy, Tommy, is walking through the house with his father, an older detective, he runs into the ghost of death who says \"Tell me About the Day Death Died\". He tells him to write about the night his mother died, but also he tells the detective to take away the keys to his safe. He does that so the ghost can't get the money the detective finds in the safe and in the house.\n\nThe ghost of death wants to give you something that you can hold in your head and it can make your dream so real. He is the most powerful evil spirit. If you ever see him, you run. He is scary and the ghosts that help him are even more scary.

{"id":3705,"ended":true,"length":377,"text":"So many moments can pass you by. Blink, and they're gone.\n\nThe most significant moment between me and my beautiful baby, that I've ever witnessed, was yesterday, when he brought me my first present.It was a small brown envelope, from the corner of my couch. I did not expect any gift of him. He never gives me any present, except for some little toys and sometimes biscuits, nothing, not even a single kiss. At the time, my room was filled with his stuff, he had thrown everything out, he only put his old toys.So, I didn't even try opening the brown bundle, as I was not thinking of any gift as he hadn't been giving me any for some months.\n\nBut after a while, I carefully ripped it open, to find out what was inside!\n\nI was in tears, as I held and felt the sweetest, smallest baby that was ever wrapped in soft brown fur! I was mesmerised and fascinated by his tiny little body and adorable small face, as he lay curled up in the same position I'd held him in. It was the most precious gift I ever received, and I'll treasure the memory forever.\n\nI will always cherish the memories of our tiny bundle of fur forever more.\n\nYour baby is the sweetest thing ever! I know I said this when you first posted but your baby is so precious...all those little hairs and toes!!! You are very lucky to have found each other. I hope that your fur baby lives a long and happy life.\n\n__________________\n\"Those that are lucky enough to find love and laughter, should chase it with this memory\"\n\nIt is too soon to say if anything can touch my heart, your baby is simply adorable. I think I'll put a tiny wreath on my doorstep when Santa arrives this year!
