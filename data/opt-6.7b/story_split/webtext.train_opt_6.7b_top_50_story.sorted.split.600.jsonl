{"id":1033,"ended":true,"length":586,"text":"An old man's happiest memory comes back when he accidentally gets lost on the way home.\n\nThe old man is wandering the streets late at night when a young boy comes up, asking if he has any change. However, the old man does not have much, so he is only able to give him four coins (which is all he has at the time). The boy promises to return them after he turns them in at the next street.\n\nThe next morning, the old man is on his way when he comes upon a city guard station. He enters only to find it locked. When he reaches the front desk, he asks the guard there where he can find the king. The guard replies to tell him he is in the town square at his next turn.\n\nAn old man wants to travel a fair distance to get home, so he heads out with his son on the road. All is going well when they come upon a traveler selling flowers, so the old man bought some. When his son asks him what he is going to give him for them, the old man smiles and replies that he will be taking his flower basket away with the four coins in it.\n\nOn his way home the next day, the old man and his son come upon a beautiful castle. He decides that he would like to go inside, although the old man knows that nothing could ever be so beautiful as his flower basket of four coins. When he reaches the castle, he is greeted by a very beautiful young woman. She hands him back the four coins from the flower baskets and requests that the old man explain to her why he is looking for the king.\n\nThe old man tells her where he left his horse, but also that he wishes to travel many steps with it to get home. She tells him that she would like to help him, but that she cannot, but that she can help him get home another way... And that was it. He did not understand her words.\n\nThe old man returns to his home and shows his son the beautiful flower basket in the same spot which it was on his way home. His son tells him that they should not be happy about losing their flower baskets. The old man replies that he should not be happy about four coins either.\n\nAt least he got home. The old man and his son decide to look for the young woman the next day to see what she was doing after helping him. They did not find her, but did come across a very sad looking dog.\n\nThe dog, not being one to ask for help, tells them the whole story. The beautiful young woman had offered to help him, but she was told by the king to instead keep him. The two went on their journey together, and the dog was now at the end of his rope. The old man and son decide that it would be useless to argue with the dog's owner, and so they let the dog go.","token_len":600,"entropy":[7.4366,2.4361,3.663,11.8637,2.8103,4.4638,2.6407,4.8892,0.4841,6.9855,4.3867,4.2208,2.805,1.1327,2.4318,1.0354,1.1422,2.1511,0.002,2.5854,4.5173,0.1314,2.3501,6.8957,1.5787,0.9016,7.6872,0.2172,0.002,2.1965,2.0623,3.3652,2.5114,2.033,1.9344,4.2566,4.0853,1.8948,0.2683,2.3525,1.4978,7.7691,1.082,6.1339,0.0956,1.4423,1.5217,0.0239,3.3253,0.065,2.449,3.5517,4.0472,1.4809,0.3354,3.5242,5.2928,1.8662,0.0017,3.8333,1.7771,6.8289,4.4026,4.3271,3.3131,2.2758,4.5278,0.4487,1.4232,4.6004,1.3071,2.0039,0.6969,1.994,1.2083,6.1405,0.5152,2.9618,1.8499,3.7975,1.1764,5.6566,4.4906,0.5096,4.5518,0.6849,3.791,5.2753,2.1829,1.0822,0.0002,1.7322,4.0099,2.0279,0.2575,0.8323,0.9059,0.0188,1.9368,4.2357,0.483,0.0484,5.5163,0.8434,3.4759,2.273,0.4435,7.3219,3.0144,4.8516,1.0462,1.2089,6.2185,6.1013,0.377,0.3647,3.3954,5.2823,1.1458,3.0327,0.3754,5.2706,0.5861,4.3583,2.9256,0.3845,0.5568,5.4474,1.6141,0.4725,7.4542,4.0526,0.8594,2.078,0.9166,0.8721,8.9275,1.6083,1.1502,0.1694,1.7056,3.9643,5.7412,0.1313,2.7417,2.0275,2.2037,1.0561,4.202,3.8342,4.9072,4.2885,4.9565,4.6314,0.662,1.2785,0.0002,5.9674,0.4324,0.0894,5.9051,0.2443,6.1801,4.4483,6.5223,1.1332,1.4796,2.4841,3.9118,1.1441,1.7373,0.1408,4.1714,2.9674,3.1299,1.517,4.0691,4.7845,2.0862,2.2611,0.5807,6.9532,4.5075,4.0563,0.1952,2.7955,3.2461,3.0065,1.0604,0.4723,7.1011,7.2169,4.1811,3.0075,3.6952,1.9091,0.897,0.01,9.449,2.3585,2.5428,2.4984,4.4474,0.3205,2.4617,1.8478,2.1605,0.6139,1.397,3.5203,0.0721,4.2298,0.8712,3.7707,3.3207,0.0915,0.5599,0.3752,0.0016,6.0005,0.5068,4.2659,1.2054,0.4008,1.2332,3.4399,4.1573,2.8877,6.5706,5.568,5.3973,3.7877,4.6322,6.6054,0.1282,3.6028,0.3149,0.2248,0.7395,0.0002,4.8797,1.4725,0.1606,0.6323,4.5614,4.3811,0.9208,0.114,0.5675,0.6622,0.0058,4.4856,0.3182,0.2745,2.9321,1.5105,0.3434,4.7557,6.9869,1.2388,2.819,4.9013,2.5279,0.9484,3.0691,0.4888,0.0939,1.8557,4.0198,1.6945,6.4767,1.9948,2.4944,0.0066,4.66,0.7605,5.9207,3.4012,3.5657,0.8812,2.9974,1.3288,0.739,3.9237,8.3502,0.3077,6.0665,4.1129,0.4228,0.2677,2.6149,0.8478,4.0059,0.2285,0.5312,0.3515,0.5463,2.308,1.3655,0.0955,0.8539,4.7384,2.1983,1.7016,1.5149,1.0096,1.499,6.4387,0.1834,5.8113,0.7449,0.5204,0.0559,4.8602,0.973,0.5819,4.3186,0.8183,6.5876,0.8227,2.9718,1.3276,0.0033,6.3661,1.689,0.391,1.4332,0.3361,1.8763,4.0841,0.5745,1.7487,2.2959,0.3698,0.943,0.0001,1.3278,1.2247,0.0037,3.139,0.1959,6.2764,0.9001,5.6894,2.0619,7.2873,1.2229,1.6752,6.9184,2.4981,0.5301,5.6239,0.3645,3.6104,5.9697,5.7279,3.7053,1.7655,3.1734,1.7081,0.7205,0.2404,2.5416,2.1116,0.0886,0.3733,1.4356,3.3424,0.4817,0.3618,4.2536,0.2896,2.1033,0.7957,2.02,0.9728,2.7092,3.31,5.202,1.5869,0.5783,2.4749,1.6181,0.5473,3.6224,0.4534,11.1277,1.4793,6.5258,5.9095,2.1905,5.3383,3.1187,0.5725,2.9288,4.5647,0.4212,4.5298,2.423,3.0225,1.6625,0.6211,0.0002,1.7318,2.1348,0.0072,3.6426,1.2674,0.9237,3.0842,1.2396,5.3791,2.0492,1.5628,1.039,5.2949,1.6416,0.3885,3.9318,1.4977,5.9823,3.5081,5.5014,5.8151,0.9721,3.8829,1.8074,0.9372,0.3924,0.4099,4.8668,0.1861,3.1879,0.2159,0.3184,2.9282,2.6558,3.5764,2.3127,6.1948,2.528,5.2757,1.1692,2.1302,1.0321,1.6492,1.3131,0.3388,0.0033,3.29,0.2971,0.8376,3.0941,1.8886,1.2966,1.4676,0.7945,11.2051,0.2551,6.3629,0.9197,1.0376,0.0002,3.9637,5.774,2.3889,3.8837,2.0981,2.7327,2.2717,1.1765,0.0079,3.1059,0.1462,0.0756,4.2385,0.2972,5.8014,0.4128,0.7826,6.0344,1.2892,6.4139,1.9623,0.3359,3.7519,1.436,1.9425,1.1805,4.1695,1.373,5.5276,7.17,0.892,2.451,1.8872,7.3613,0.3835,0.8478,0.6054,1.0816,0.6511,4.3057,4.348,0.3922,1.0856,3.7824,4.9345,1.7292,6.7295,1.0427,1.1576,0.0002,1.4046,2.0249,3.5511,5.7665,2.6768,5.6112,1.1308,5.8747,1.12,1.7997,0.2981,3.8336,1.5662,3.7444,4.0808,0.2499,1.4664,1.2632,7.5725,1.6088,0.3978,6.3337,5.9974,0.6639,1.323,0.8156,1.5611,0.3191,1.9523,1.8749,4.6585,1.8814,0.7241,4.2873,2.3491,8.2315,4.6393,2.8695,2.6405,1.1069,3.6583,4.6255,2.8152,1.4687,2.2261,2.2767,0.9904,1.2151,1.6394,1.3149,2.4598,5.2148,4.4806,1.5374,3.2845,0.0174,0.8711,2.1812,0.6884,1.7918,1.4943,0.0054,1.9775,4.1773,2.6198,1.9489,2.0521,1.7972,0.1329,7.8781,0.5371,7.0429,1.3932,0.8118,0.4387,3.7625,3.1205,1.1097,1.8985,2.8702,0.5983,4.9968,0.7049,0.2741,0.5902,0.7102]}

You can now open the door and run\n\nSo what is this one where you can't use the door switch since it's in a different part of the room, you just keep going until it opens or use the light switch to open it?

{"id":738,"ended":true,"length":567,"text":"A prison guard goes to great lengths to make the pun `` a small medium at large. ''\n\nThe book is a collection of 25 short stories by a leading crime writer. The author, David Lodge, tells his own stories `` through the eyes of his characters. ''\n\nThey include a doctor at an infirmary, a police officer who is investigating the death of a local child, a woman running a drug dealing ring, and a detective named Richard Castle.\n\nThe title refers to a prison and castle, and Castle makes it one of his missions to hunt down bad guys.\n\nHis latest suspect had escaped from prison the night before, and he has not been seen in two days. With help from colleagues, he figures out that he has fled to the neighboring castle.\n\nAt that point a problem arises. He cannot locate the castle, but he knows it is on the same hill that is in the middle of both locations. Once he realizes that, he figures out a plan to get inside the castle walls.\n\nThe castle is made up of interconnected stone rooms, which he gradually and logically enters. He finds himself in a dungeon, which has been converted to a prison.\n\nA fellow inmate, a prisoner named Jack Denton, tells him his story. He had been serving six years for a serious crime, but because another inmate told a story about being a murderer, he is given a few extra years.\n\nJack knows that only inmates convicted of particularly severe crimes are sentenced to longer sentences. He does not think the other inmate who told the story was telling the truth, so he helps Castle escape.\n\nThe author takes the time to explain the complex structure of the castle, even as he explains how Castle made it so that he knew exactly where the prisoner had escaped.\n\nHe also describes each prisoner's room and how they are guarded. His detailed description of the jail cells, the guard towers, and the prison is fascinating.\n\nThe action in his book consists mainly of Castle chasing people and putting them in jail. Other policemen, who are investigating the circumstances surrounding the child's death, also are involved in what happens.\n\nAs one can imagine, the stories in this book offer plenty of excitement, but they are also told with humor and wit. The way each story builds on the previous one is a unique feature.\n\nThere is a short chapter about the book itself after each story.

{"id":3037,"ended":true,"length":581,"text":"Lying on your deathbed you see a message flash before your eyes, `` System Failure, Unable To Restart. '' You blink, and open your eyes in a strange room. There are chairs on the wall, chairs of all shapes, sizes and kinds. You find a chair to your liking, and lean back a bit. You hear a loud beep, and your chair turns into your personal computer. You see your new desktop : it looks so neat. You see icons for things like mail, web, audio, pictures, video, and more. It is the desktop of your dreams. You are happy and feeling blessed, until you hear a soft voice say to you, `` Dear User, you had a lot of windows open, but now you have them. Try closing everything as much as you can, and then restart the machine. Have a nice day!!!!\n\nI've just thought a good way to get rid of that screen, use your mouse or stylus to draw and wipe your butt in red, pink, green, and blue all over the desktop. The screen would be covered in that color, with smears all over it, or just wiped up with a clean sheet and paper. That would be pretty bad ass, and would have a lot of meaning; I'd just want them to be subtle.\n\nI'm not saying you should be an artist, just keep in mind that you don't need to use a complicated system to get out of this mess.\n\nThat's an interesting thought, but this could be also used against the other users, maybe it would just look like a huge mess that could not be cleaned :-s. But its definitely worth thinking about!\n\nThat's exactly the way I think about the problem: you don't need to go out of your way too hard.\n\nAlso, I don't think that you have to worry about what the other users can see. I like the idea of using an instrument like a pen or a needle for wiping (or for drawing) up a mess on the desktop, but the best solution to your problem is to just minimize your programs and windows.\n\nThe only one that looks like a problem to me is the music. A better idea would be to keep some music applications as shortcuts so it would be more fast and intuitive, but the biggest problem is that when you close a program, it is just closed at the level of a program, not by a window. In other words, the window and its files are still there and can still cause problems.\n\nI don't know if you are aware of this problem, but it is one of the main reasons why there hasn't been many big updates in Windows (XP or higher) since the upgrade from 3.1 to 3.11; it can be extremely frustrating to have updates force the computer shutdown. Anyway, the solutions mentioned in these forums have always worked for me, and I hope they do for you too.","token_len":605,"entropy":[8.9194,2.6923,3.2521,6.4024,0.4181,5.8403,4.0338,1.7859,6.7272,7.9665,4.4699,0.7854,0.1838,2.2055,10.1021,13.8012,5.2014,2.8458,5.9813,2.6203,4.615,1.1903,2.9216,4.921,2.1991,6.7084,1.8096,1.6428,7.1621,0.7248,1.061,3.9621,2.6696,4.3772,6.0219,0.7063,2.8772,1.661,8.8035,2.3903,0.684,3.8405,0.968,4.0713,4.5684,2.6949,2.4961,1.8597,1.0219,0.9291,6.398,1.1349,1.6365,4.3344,1.5854,3.4838,4.7573,2.0265,7.4087,0.6267,0.9757,5.2939,2.4458,4.3508,0.804,0.9967,1.5748,3.5175,0.8701,2.9116,6.8823,0.2222,1.1046,0.3176,3.3645,7.591,4.477,2.5212,4.3683,6.8089,2.9308,0.4751,1.3424,3.7664,2.9002,5.2159,4.1567,10.7839,3.1798,2.7981,5.3054,5.0769,1.5234,0.9433,3.7471,8.4051,2.0353,4.2139,0.8653,7.3117,0.5757,4.9565,1.6388,6.168,0.6167,3.7871,0.3118,3.7086,0.537,1.6031,1.7506,0.4287,2.7681,2.2652,3.5595,3.9876,1.5141,1.7363,3.5369,0.7018,1.0333,3.2641,4.7587,2.1226,6.9613,6.5999,1.6173,5.8496,0.8492,2.3359,0.9118,4.9356,2.9284,1.8945,3.6478,0.2438,0.5476,0.1049,4.8556,6.4464,0.467,4.1297,5.9212,1.348,4.6964,0.5792,10.2861,1.0905,1.7581,1.8171,3.5673,1.3446,1.2954,4.4995,2.8049,5.2706,4.4918,6.0858,5.7678,4.1574,0.0385,0.7411,0.0734,1.6932,0.9892,2.5391,3.1365,1.6828,3.2129,0.6875,5.9349,1.4086,1.6447,0.2632,8.903,4.3183,0.3101,4.0047,2.9853,4.3077,7.2542,4.2957,3.9972,3.7251,0.3564,3.293,3.4464,0.0023,4.2357,4.6947,3.6799,7.6821,3.706,3.5416,3.3877,6.5275,0.0004,1.6125,5.47,3.4509,8.4685,1.8993,9.147,4.3621,8.2674,2.2977,6.849,0.4198,3.3121,0.4523,1.7295,0.9576,6.8924,1.532,1.4908,4.0689,0.6505,3.5473,3.2397,4.5752,1.6294,6.0983,0.7625,6.0044,2.7732,1.4396,4.3147,8.2706,4.2172,3.4106,0.1327,0.8441,1.302,4.7071,4.0204,7.4798,4.7158,1.1292,1.5593,3.701,4.3052,5.1819,4.0054,0.4132,4.2261,1.3751,0.7967,3.5479,4.4437,7.8706,1.38,2.0217,3.1545,3.9408,2.2772,2.3603,0.192,7.4981,7.2363,2.1974,2.4835,2.6991,2.5191,5.7303,0.4775,1.1399,8.5448,1.7914,1.8,0.0004,1.9261,2.3167,1.9112,3.3401,1.7917,1.1636,3.3699,5.6544,3.5806,0.7617,2.6274,5.9241,2.8672,0.0194,0.558,1.5523,2.9036,0.0004,2.0092,0.8209,3.6545,2.0022,9.318,3.607,1.1522,2.3733,4.5914,0.261,1.6171,2.6834,0.4401,2.0762,0.0004,5.1429,0.7794,4.8571,2.583,2.4122,0.8935,2.1427,4.9085,4.698,0.932,7.1606,2.206,6.5618,2.817,3.9127,1.8536,2.1592,5.3308,3.9204,2.1121,3.3455,5.5269,2.065,1.421,5.5437,2.4951,3.9735,3.0198,4.4056,0.1741,1.5068,10.8056,3.8076,7.4145,2.4896,4.33,6.1408,5.3714,2.2357,3.4362,0.3766,4.9556,0.8825,0.0005,5.0475,0.6729,5.8002,2.763,2.9419,1.0036,2.6174,1.2498,2.7667,2.7808,2.9633,3.5261,3.1773,0.0018,1.2538,0.5027,4.1948,3.2755,1.9387,0.1845,0.0239,7.9074,2.054,2.6016,2.3116,0.0007,5.3437,0.595,1.9691,2.7662,0.0006,1.2013,2.0099,2.3084,3.0616,0.3591,3.262,0.2621,4.196,2.6314,2.2938,0.618,4.4847,1.8212,1.5055,2.5483,4.6593,2.1284,1.0594,0.3621,3.4023,3.4304,7.056,2.8085,0.6139,3.1351,1.8635,1.0486,7.6823,4.2901,5.9926,5.7466,2.6916,4.7474,3.8402,2.6267,3.9159,2.8265,2.0154,3.7224,0.9462,0.8756,1.3285,1.631,3.5697,5.3431,2.8491,3.276,5.5285,0.6666,0.5075,0.5121,2.1739,8.0941,1.876,8.2871,1.8899,4.4199,1.5729,1.0153,0.0003,3.1949,3.1819,4.4025,1.5389,4.7232,1.4067,0.7867,2.4645,3.1222,0.1477,0.3445,1.3988,6.0433,1.8784,5.0444,6.1515,3.4655,0.8701,0.0428,0.3343,4.0911,4.2071,1.9591,7.8083,3.5219,4.4434,4.0719,4.5011,3.9564,0.9257,3.0305,8.0221,1.5251,4.6128,2.4477,1.5351,3.1577,5.8365,0.9747,1.4041,0.6879,4.0985,0.6618,5.043,2.078,0.7934,0.9779,1.167,2.729,3.6109,6.4751,5.1631,0.841,7.4274,0.5038,2.0592,2.7521,2.578,3.1215,6.1304,2.0327,3.5631,0.5332,4.441,2.1279,0.0173,0.2057,2.4809,3.497,5.5516,2.8548,5.0105,0.7665,4.0236,1.7225,3.3124,3.2812,3.14,7.8983,0.6814,0.7781,0.7885,0.0002,2.1277,2.828,0.0007,1.6825,1.0627,1.6269,3.1534,1.8518,0.5652,1.1606,1.3393,0.4341,0.3072,2.2392,1.2831,3.2267,0.5917,0.6286,2.0876,0.9228,0.7322,3.8757,6.6976,0.0004,0.0143,4.2582,5.4234,4.4082,1.6957,3.3806,4.9815,9.0519,3.5955,5.6519,1.4083,1.7229,1.4821,7.8327,3.2562,4.2695,0.0533,1.9032,0.7983,0.6183,0.0007,4.6409,5.2002,2.1868,4.6179,0.8813,5.0641,1.8453,1.2864,2.1979,6.9334,8.2315,3.5463,4.0265,8.2931,2.1407,6.3606,0.0538,2.8483,6.6222,4.8115,2.2194,4.7713,5.8869,2.8257,4.2342,2.0112,1.8438,0.1749,0.7446,0.9346,1.032,2.5942,2.0871,3.3761,1.1527,0.4632,2.1045,0.6927]}
{"id":1005,"ended":false,"length":551,"text":"I Miss Something Special' - Puel Hails Leicester's 'Special' Record-Breaking 9-0 Win Over Southampton\nLeicester City manager Claude Puel has described Vardy's strike as 'one of the best goals of his career'. (Photo Credits: Getty Images)\nSouthampton, October 24: Leicester City boss Claude Puel believes Jamie Vardy's goal in Sunday's 9-0 rout of Southampton was up there with the best of his career.\nAfter Vardy's strike put Leicester 1-0 up after 14 minutes, the hosts exploded with five goals in the second half as Ayoze Perez, James Maddison, Marc Albrighton, Rachid Ghezzal and Marcin Wasilewski also got on the score sheet.\n\"He [Vardy] scored an amazing goal, and that is very big for our confidence. He was a very good addition. That is a wonderful feeling,\" Puel told Leicester's official website.\n\"I think it was one of the best goals of his career. Jamie is experienced and he always tries to enjoy his game, to make the right movement and enjoy this goal, but he is a team player. He was fantastic. It is nice for him.\n\"It is a fantastic performance. We needed that after the defeat against Crystal Palace. It is fantastic for the team and I am happy for my players.\n\"The most important thing is the result. The second half was fantastic. We played well between a defensive and offensive game. It was a great performance from the beginning to the end.\n\"I am happy. It is more than a first win for the first game. We are happy with the first result, and it means we are more consistent and good with each other. It is important, but the Premier League is so tough with all these great teams.\"\nVardy, who is eight goals behind Thierry Henry's Premier League record of 49 goals for Arsenal, was full of praise for the record win which was Leicester's biggest ever in the competition.\n\"The first half, we went 1-0 up which was nice,\" he said. \"But we knew we had plenty of work to do. We came back out with a different desire at half-time and, once we got a goal, it was a game of cat and mouse after that. They didn't come out in a way that allowed us to continue and we took our chances when we got them.\n\"The manager said at half-time the lads had to run in behind and score goals. We worked hard today. We had a lot of possession and it was important to take our chances and we managed to do that.\n\"Obviously with a 9-0 scoreline, this isn't a big number. Our fans will be disappointed because they could see the quality of football, but not the scoreline. It's still a new record, so I hope that keeps going for a long time.\"","token_len":607,"entropy":[10.5526,7.0308,5.4714,5.0107,4.0088,6.4045,10.5125,6.4519,9.61,11.6268,3.012,3.1912,5.9608,1.7699,4.8062,4.5024,2.3396,8.4373,2.3213,3.0018,3.9048,1.3726,3.9273,2.1384,10.893,0.0007,2.0573,3.9287,4.9613,0.0724,0.0001,1.3713,3.9555,8.451,2.061,0.6513,5.4062,0.4032,1.2466,3.3039,0.0792,0.1229,1.5511,3.3713,1.3814,1.286,0.3021,0.7782,6.1928,2.0925,7.9875,0.047,1.1311,0.0524,0.1764,0.5439,7.5669,0.0009,4.2661,8.0383,3.7273,1.6061,2.9652,0.7293,3.2119,0.4925,0.0028,0.0005,4.5725,5.8114,0.0008,0.0,0.7783,2.0199,2.8143,3.097,0.0173,6.9054,0.0144,0.0554,4.6235,0.9821,0.3744,1.4774,9.3125,2.4571,0.0525,1.0112,0.6021,1.2973,1.9635,0.2054,0.3375,0.6506,5.2295,3.4921,0.0006,1.2855,3.5038,6.1572,1.3543,3.522,0.0498,0.2153,0.0804,3.9177,4.3716,0.0311,0.6131,1.5019,4.4301,9.8685,2.6032,5.2707,2.9922,1.1277,0.8335,2.1096,0.1536,3.5687,7.6897,3.7032,0.0003,0.0576,2.8073,4.5822,7.5274,0.2285,0.9361,6.623,2.493,0.1083,0.0008,0.8959,5.5049,4.1886,1.6616,5.0995,4.332,3.8212,4.1244,0.7776,6.2991,3.781,9.7332,1.0398,0.0281,0.0005,5.1994,5.0075,2.2127,0.2566,4.6697,0.2486,0.258,0.1795,2.3129,2.7805,4.5882,0.3554,0.0008,0.015,2.7388,3.9599,1.4739,0.141,2.3269,2.3604,2.414,2.308,4.875,5.3764,0.7276,3.2752,6.8441,2.1927,1.8727,2.4848,2.1199,2.0673,1.0274,7.4886,3.0427,3.995,1.244,1.943,4.9236,3.9467,1.4313,0.7729,0.0006,1.0559,2.4318,1.4251,0.5533,0.1122,0.2175,0.3339,0.8463,2.0639,1.4619,1.9729,0.7477,2.112,0.0122,0.026,0.1567,0.0851,0.0853,0.013,0.0087,0.6336,4.7103,2.7584,7.9181,1.2741,1.7098,5.9336,3.8178,0.249,7.7578,1.8953,2.0525,2.1038,4.0818,3.2395,1.934,2.3784,7.957,1.2398,7.1094,5.349,3.5969,2.468,2.2793,1.6742,2.6157,1.8029,5.5472,0.2052,1.1171,1.1271,2.5833,4.4938,1.6516,2.7497,1.6243,4.5261,2.6097,1.5914,3.2539,1.5001,0.0931,2.3057,1.2275,1.5201,3.8663,4.1814,1.8016,2.3798,4.598,2.8566,5.6194,1.5029,3.9251,2.874,5.0304,0.0005,0.8841,1.9953,1.163,4.7723,0.9559,1.7095,1.1088,1.828,3.3524,1.7882,1.6021,1.2383,5.8765,1.364,1.1138,2.2867,0.0596,2.8524,5.5976,0.2062,0.1691,0.7187,2.9069,3.7502,1.0317,2.523,4.2777,0.5119,0.6261,3.3804,1.0124,1.5158,2.9752,1.5481,8.7943,6.1195,7.7992,2.1129,2.9373,4.9576,0.6963,2.169,0.6774,0.9085,2.1816,1.752,2.353,1.4951,6.8608,3.8635,0.4051,0.4381,0.7238,1.5395,0.073,1.9163,1.7034,1.0139,4.1925,2.1588,0.757,5.7715,2.2118,1.928,6.3794,3.965,1.6034,1.768,5.5895,3.2138,1.5166,1.7917,2.0223,2.5296,1.6168,0.82,3.6256,2.9433,2.3685,2.0891,2.3262,4.217,3.2689,1.7414,3.9414,4.9964,1.8482,5.0257,4.3311,3.7668,0.6575,0.8378,2.2269,0.6455,3.2395,4.2686,2.2737,2.9077,7.3777,0.0006,0.4783,3.4251,3.8341,4.2939,4.5552,1.5882,5.1304,1.4204,2.327,0.1695,2.325,0.0038,2.5903,0.8544,2.2978,7.2865,1.7812,2.2315,6.9098,0.0372,0.0001,0.0001,2.3867,3.3772,0.001,0.43,1.0155,6.0319,1.2993,2.6767,4.0816,0.6307,2.648,7.5266,0.1106,0.145,0.2957,1.3104,6.3075,3.569,4.9097,2.8243,6.0146,0.2915,4.3877,1.5029,2.2399,1.019,3.1056,0.4262,0.1391,0.4119,2.8495,2.6308,1.963,3.085,1.6843,4.0239,5.4515,0.0266,0.1279,0.1026,7.5882,0.7575,4.2793,1.4167,0.7914,0.2901,0.1127,0.3187,2.8934,1.7118,4.329,1.1729,0.9262,6.6169,0.3592,3.367,0.1798,0.0326,0.9073,0.9336,4.3129,1.4079,4.1259,2.6204,1.0698,5.5403,8.4393,5.0723,2.7489,0.5696,0.0009,1.3719,5.2909,4.5975,0.8344,1.0766,3.1278,2.1639,0.6522,1.9851,0.5617,1.7286,4.882,1.9673,9.2858,0.0554,0.0202,7.2017,0.7222,0.3776,5.2789,3.9671,0.0009,3.7232,1.7241,3.6181,1.8394,4.856,0.7161,5.0154,0.1804,0.1452,5.3817,3.0322,2.3762,4.4021,2.8907,0.9623,4.8413,0.44,1.5454,2.0309,0.4214,0.5912,0.1134,2.5165,6.298,2.6897,4.3838,0.259,0.0463,0.0011,4.9258,7.4727,0.0143,2.1045,1.6093,5.6135,3.5102,3.7899,2.2546,4.6263,3.1061,1.1062,1.6884,5.0811,0.8696,5.5276,1.4244,0.9861,2.6563,1.3655,1.2452,0.1154,4.8495,1.2361,3.0839,0.6312,2.8892,1.1742,3.5988,2.3056,0.1039,2.1761,2.5565,5.136,0.4846,1.6158,0.293,0.715,1.6796,0.6624,5.7492,5.1848,2.4512,7.6009,0.0302,0.0635,4.5665,1.1953,0.7648,4.913,5.3894,0.0002,1.7457,3.1748,4.0184,1.5721,5.483,5.0062,3.211,1.3556,2.5112,2.9199,2.3122,5.2039,3.5443,1.8633,5.2714,0.8377,7.1743,3.4115,0.6346,5.5704,1.8438,4.4996,0.3896,0.5352,2.0533,2.509,5.0158,0.8409,6.9258,1.8459,1.8414,2.4936,2.4375,2.9688,2.0744,6.8489,1.0067,3.7913,2.4789,0.643,0.0886,0.768]}
{"id":2582,"ended":true,"length":515,"text":"When humanity finally develops the means for interstellar travel, we discover that all other sentient life in the universe disappeared a long time ago.\n\nThe aliens who visited us long ago are long gone, so we don\u2019t leave any message for them, and they have no way of getting in touch with us.\n\nSo humanity sets out to build a new civilization for us to inhabit.\n\nThey call it a New Eden.\n\nBut, if they did leave, it\u2019s possible our planet will be colonized by another race.\n\nIt makes you wonder, who else has visited our planet?\n\nSo who left us messages on planets?\n\nOne candidate may be SETI.\n\nThe most famous SETI message is probably the Arecibo Message, on a giant telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Arecibo Message was sent back in 1974, on the 50th anniversary of Carl Sagan\u2019s first use of the Arecibo radio dish in Puerto Rico.\n\nNASA launched the giant telescope with the goal of detecting signals from other civilizations.\n\nThe first message, sent by radio, was a carrier with the message :\n\n\u201cYou are receiving this message because technology exists allowing detection at great distances.\n\nIf you are receiving this\u2014whether by chance or because you have an intelligent civilization at your mercy\u2014you can know that the world is not flat and that your scientists are mistaken about almost everything.\u201d\n\nAlthough radio waves would not travel far enough for the Arecibo Message to reach Earth, they could be detected by nearby star systems.\n\nBut what if our search for civilizations is actually a search for the signal sent back?\n\nThere\u2019s reason to believe that many messages like the Arecibo Message aren\u2019t sent as \u201cmessages\u201d.\n\nThey\u2019re actually the encoded output of an artificial intelligence, which was then broadcast to nearby stars.\n\nWhy did they do that? Probably to show their superiority, and get attention.\n\nAnd who knows how many civilizations are trying to send a message back to us?\n\nIf we wanted to send our own message out into the universe, we\u2019d need an extremely powerful radio telescope.\n\nIt would need to be powerful enough to scan at wavelengths from 200 to a trillion megahertz.\n\nBut what\u2019s the message going to be?\n\nIf it\u2019s an encoded computer program, how do we decode it?\n\nThere need to be extremely strong and stable electrical fields which the radio waves will pass through.\n\nBut these fields would probably also be powerful enough to trigger our own civilization\u2019s electromagnetic emissions.\n\nIf radio waves don\u2019t penetrate our atmosphere, then our own transmissions will probably be blocked out.\n\nSo this idea of a search for messages from aliens is actually a search for our own communications.","token_len":608,"entropy":[10.0968,5.782,6.6137,2.1873,4.0723,2.301,6.2433,0.5768,0.5934,1.9225,8.211,0.8028,4.4672,3.8017,4.6333,0.7624,3.5561,0.4005,0.9461,10.3912,4.4896,0.9559,0.1127,0.0216,0.6,2.1404,0.0035,2.3747,5.1803,3.0136,5.8664,2.1012,5.011,0.0287,1.6705,6.3184,0.2037,1.0223,4.1116,1.5782,3.8034,15.8933,7.4961,1.6243,7.1884,2.6767,6.8024,1.901,0.2925,2.6413,2.1122,1.9679,3.0134,1.9565,2.565,0.5871,3.7555,3.4075,0.4775,0.2106,0.2937,0.6856,1.449,0.0002,3.3666,7.1153,5.2788,0.8273,0.5725,4.5935,0.4697,2.0369,0.9879,4.2765,3.153,3.0752,2.4101,0.8921,0.8213,0.0002,4.4837,4.0568,0.878,3.4741,4.3613,2.8322,1.0733,0.5746,0.0002,3.1834,3.9724,3.5027,2.3347,5.0313,4.1582,2.1591,2.2083,6.9057,0.1433,1.1612,4.3851,5.4694,3.0128,1.6752,1.6098,4.3491,0.0245,0.7069,2.6124,1.9106,1.4268,0.2616,0.0002,3.3901,5.6404,3.772,0.4265,1.9722,3.8459,4.8018,3.056,3.0812,2.0716,0.6757,1.6158,0.4441,0.0002,3.8418,3.969,6.5191,1.0678,12.1149,4.2607,7.0561,2.796,0.3111,0.0002,5.7759,8.5492,4.5823,0.7149,10.0015,0.0006,1.5681,0.2133,0.0002,2.4757,4.2967,1.7963,1.3373,0.0022,3.6816,1.713,5.2783,1.8249,10.2699,1.3019,0.0129,4.9474,1.3744,5.9531,3.1616,6.1475,4.8957,0.9297,5.4815,0.042,0.0005,0.599,1.3269,0.0009,0.2212,0.3352,0.0002,1.7827,2.8746,0.0304,0.001,1.9804,1.4394,1.3099,3.9993,1.0571,6.1035,1.5342,4.1296,1.451,5.8235,0.0282,0.0925,0.0029,7.8402,0.0079,2.5676,0.2716,1.2482,3.0111,7.4667,0.1649,1.1442,5.1171,0.0108,0.0002,2.2535,6.856,2.8287,7.8539,0.0031,0.3394,0.2049,0.0003,5.386,5.5753,0.8319,8.2801,0.6076,4.4135,1.3203,1.9563,0.0577,4.2043,3.9879,0.8046,3.2839,3.1653,1.3337,0.417,0.0002,1.9303,4.1219,3.2783,2.7779,1.4064,1.6745,4.3643,5.302,0.9324,3.4262,11.0529,4.7717,2.256,3.9397,8.5944,1.4009,0.0005,2.2196,5.4565,6.253,1.4272,6.5168,1.5767,0.1468,0.9392,9.6547,3.9416,8.2534,10.2085,5.296,5.637,0.167,0.8142,1.2201,0.0002,4.4986,0.764,1.8793,3.0872,0.6742,11.5519,5.1132,3.0142,5.406,0.31,3.7495,1.0263,2.0977,3.1387,4.1335,2.1266,4.6125,0.8069,7.0636,0.1408,1.173,3.3412,5.9039,1.2798,2.6053,3.6365,0.7276,2.4721,4.5085,2.0097,1.7902,3.3224,8.0691,0.9036,8.9276,2.3918,7.9385,0.2513,0.5356,2.6609,6.0713,0.3436,0.0002,6.9224,5.5563,3.7544,6.0658,1.9879,3.9245,2.7866,3.2419,2.5499,2.9766,1.1222,0.0069,0.0006,1.7078,0.4334,1.1608,1.8391,0.1647,1.618,1.5366,1.8239,1.2832,1.0751,7.3307,5.1915,0.9039,0.9834,0.2134,0.0002,4.3123,3.8693,0.8508,3.9763,7.902,0.2814,6.0304,2.5658,5.2538,2.4414,3.0631,0.0651,3.1527,5.7792,5.2124,2.2295,3.5343,0.2768,0.0002,4.3361,5.7105,0.355,0.1152,6.7763,0.475,0.4494,0.5071,4.5837,6.1718,5.7997,1.3356,0.5153,0.0046,0.0004,0.734,6.382,0.4314,0.8698,0.0082,3.1633,5.4673,12.6939,1.3044,5.5613,0.0069,2.4952,6.1395,1.3029,0.3993,0.0002,3.8123,2.3012,0.1419,2.005,4.743,4.089,6.5372,9.0686,0.3343,2.9943,3.5199,0.2466,2.1682,2.1015,3.9793,6.2174,5.8835,1.1743,7.0754,1.5305,0.8742,0.3974,0.0002,5.0116,3.2792,2.5451,3.191,1.262,0.1356,7.761,3.2396,3.4146,3.0548,1.9118,2.88,2.5764,5.6151,3.1353,1.6316,0.5976,0.0002,4.133,4.6747,2.8113,2.71,1.397,2.2685,2.9064,5.7798,0.0711,3.0789,4.2641,0.2824,1.6258,1.0711,1.3216,0.8104,0.5495,0.0001,3.7001,1.8947,5.1481,0.1658,2.3906,3.8199,1.7173,0.9804,5.4765,2.7776,0.6887,0.788,0.231,1.0032,3.6004,0.1371,2.0413,1.2666,3.8477,6.0709,1.2182,3.5593,0.9517,1.1629,0.2891,0.0003,3.1803,2.9845,3.6022,0.7726,0.4437,3.0586,0.1147,0.1867,4.6707,5.7071,5.4413,3.5919,5.1547,1.0312,4.7193,4.0075,7.7517,0.015,0.0,0.767,0.2835,0.0002,2.7698,3.0547,7.0954,0.6722,2.0666,1.1545,5.1593,3.8646,0.2682,0.6307,1.0599,0.5223,0.0001,3.4252,2.0499,0.7371,0.0259,0.0324,3.4965,3.2878,6.3599,1.3026,0.6224,4.0936,2.4463,0.5159,4.7627,0.3874,0.3323,0.2888,0.0002,4.0672,8.8298,0.3082,0.0112,7.1339,2.338,4.0012,4.5109,5.6839,2.6365,5.1698,4.9044,2.3507,1.1975,3.3761,2.9718,0.1628,0.6448,0.3456,0.0002,2.7723,4.5834,1.1708,2.5748,4.7686,4.9825,1.3187,4.5948,0.0764,0.0949,4.9632,5.1469,1.2591,3.2039,2.7887,0.1753,0.5198,6.222,4.9839,0.3084,0.1885,0.0002,2.7895,5.1539,0.5895,5.2811,0.4079,0.0661,0.0073,4.3031,2.9109,2.0524,0.5899,1.8592,3.0518,3.991,7.7571,1.9261,2.6666,0.9222,3.7447,2.1806,1.0698,0.2125,0.0002,2.4765,4.8204,6.0553,1.7537,2.1135,6.8975,0.0483,5.1843,1.8819,2.4987,1.3635,3.216,1.4632,5.0256,0.0511,4.0498,0.3097,5.3933,0.7693]}
{"id":3453,"ended":true,"length":557,"text":"An infectious disease, endemically transmissible to patients within a certain fandom culture. How do you react?\n\nThe most commonly contracted strain is \"furry\", resulting into physical and mental deterioration. Symptoms vary but usually end on being a complete breakdown of their personality, including, if they're an artist \"furry art\"; if they're an artist \"fur\" (paint or sketchfur); if they're a writer \"fur\" (novels and stories).\n\nIt is also known to spread and incubate in places of significant density due to \"furry\" - such as online forums and deviant art - and is the reason that there are so many \"furry\" characters who work to spread to as many different media as possible in order to infect as many minds as possible. Most often symptoms are \"depression\", \"laziness\" and even \"suicide\".\n\nIt is not known how or why it is that \"furry\" is contracted, although some speculate that there may be a viral agent with a similarity to DNA that, once introduced to human cells, attaches themselves and replicates in order to spread and infect the human cells as well. How it affects one person may prove completely different from how it affect another as well.\n\nIt is also not clear why certain individuals seem to have a particularly high chance of catching the disease - those who have a sexual interest in animal characters of known species. There are theories that certain genetic variants of the human brain cause this - those with a lower than average average intelligence. Some also speculate that a certain class of drug or chemical may be to blame - that being synthetic THC. It is also theorized that a certain class of individuals may have had some of their DNA altered by a \"geneticist\", the most commonly found being ones who self-identify as \"gay\". However, nothing but speculation is known definitively.\n\nIt can be treated through regular therapy and medication. However, it has been shown that the best course of treatment is a complete overhaul of the person's \"furry\" \"fandom\" life, as well as removing most of their \"furry\" \"material\" from their Internet presence.\n\nIt is estimated that, in 2015, at the current rate of infection (5-7 million affected with an anticipated increase at the rate of 7,000 per day), the disease's death toll could be close to half of humanity by 2016.\n\nThe disease has been dubbed \"Furryism\" or \"Furry Endemic\". With \"furries\" and \"the fandom\" the most commonly contracted forms.\n\nIf the patient chooses to take the medication course they will most likely have a short-term \"recovery\", but the \"fandom\" is almost guaranteed to have a lasting impact. The most dramatic case of recovery occurred in 2008 during \"furry\" comic creator and \"fur\" \"artist\" Brian Chippendale's \"recovery\".","token_len":608,"entropy":[11.45,0.5148,1.8256,8.2901,5.962,4.6086,6.1085,0.0262,3.9245,5.7886,4.6332,2.5759,4.6071,13.6569,5.7878,2.0562,7.2391,2.4955,0.9369,5.0894,1.4741,0.9834,0.0041,3.2638,3.3742,4.4246,7.6851,4.5456,0.996,4.4066,5.77,2.1613,3.1056,7.7361,8.2962,7.1292,2.2523,1.1629,5.9451,0.9812,6.0257,4.0566,4.3873,2.2809,4.817,4.5503,6.3835,3.7979,3.7244,3.7918,1.4311,3.6126,3.1237,1.785,3.4481,5.2413,5.0372,2.4478,2.4612,4.8676,4.5871,7.9913,3.5134,0.0823,4.9276,6.6595,4.2666,0.219,0.3058,1.6054,0.7879,0.8315,4.227,1.7172,2.0161,5.8179,3.2633,3.5226,6.7969,12.7063,0.8488,0.9433,0.0342,0.0665,1.8055,3.0154,0.5409,0.5479,0.2926,0.0726,5.4393,0.8824,4.1801,3.9957,2.638,3.2536,1.6555,0.0003,3.9092,2.0777,3.5905,3.0678,3.5726,3.6833,4.1984,9.2755,0.0131,1.5296,6.3469,4.0602,6.6698,7.0583,5.4609,0.0063,5.2222,2.2521,0.0731,1.8567,6.6749,3.3372,0.043,6.3494,2.3396,1.4694,8.0925,0.3868,1.2664,4.5318,1.5321,2.6757,4.2647,4.1516,2.8776,3.6922,0.675,1.3756,0.1101,2.884,1.805,0.0789,0.4568,3.8947,4.716,5.768,5.3632,2.7348,5.7153,6.5436,0.0691,2.4837,4.6056,0.7521,0.0935,4.2917,1.3051,0.0299,6.5011,3.6266,0.0271,5.9306,0.3908,0.0275,0.2691,5.3832,3.4077,7.299,1.1852,3.946,6.7886,0.4905,0.9012,1.2901,4.3349,8.7169,0.0018,1.4423,0.7483,3.6306,0.7325,5.1925,2.4727,0.71,0.8019,0.0003,3.7385,0.5343,2.5917,2.6358,1.585,4.2436,0.3736,3.3938,1.7183,3.1171,2.6924,0.6629,0.0175,0.1264,1.4574,5.9044,1.4134,3.6748,2.9188,3.3335,0.6479,4.7751,1.0945,0.2111,1.0721,5.1246,5.1947,5.699,2.1446,6.3981,0.0774,7.7695,2.6803,5.3654,4.4582,5.0065,1.7189,3.6977,1.3219,0.191,7.4322,5.2798,4.2166,6.4547,0.0068,2.1481,5.1609,0.0296,2.8203,3.4967,1.6898,2.4087,2.6166,4.2553,4.625,1.7101,0.8747,5.5923,4.3542,4.3931,4.3993,2.0814,2.6546,6.715,5.9388,0.6273,0.843,1.8532,0.3633,6.6712,2.7213,5.0161,2.346,0.3745,0.4249,0.0003,3.4374,0.4328,1.907,2.6415,3.4579,2.3993,4.0061,3.5928,5.3392,0.1058,1.8506,1.6017,4.7581,1.2197,4.737,0.0585,5.9584,1.79,2.0331,3.9639,5.5035,0.9281,1.9226,2.4662,8.2134,3.0541,0.2707,4.6073,3.4936,5.5674,6.2734,3.4062,4.4186,4.202,1.1613,4.5837,0.8782,3.6766,5.9453,2.3695,3.2021,1.0059,3.5397,4.7062,4.2584,2.5648,3.4865,5.3341,1.9353,2.0941,4.5229,5.8083,1.0735,5.781,3.2303,2.9124,2.9611,3.7165,1.8658,0.1223,3.5463,2.9423,6.3727,0.0394,7.3477,2.7722,4.1085,2.8391,1.1084,4.6846,0.0015,2.7781,3.6847,4.8347,5.3695,4.1669,1.8815,3.5559,0.4587,1.4661,4.5762,0.5098,0.0873,2.9685,1.3244,3.8348,0.0257,7.7147,0.9913,1.143,4.425,3.4057,3.4814,2.2417,2.9519,2.0612,2.0105,2.3735,4.2828,4.9436,0.2212,4.0942,1.8279,4.5856,5.1106,2.919,3.2644,4.9758,8.725,0.8638,8.3012,0.2606,0.5429,0.0163,0.1092,1.3216,5.2321,0.8895,4.5502,0.2936,6.0564,8.0626,2.1837,1.7485,1.3215,9.3921,1.4246,0.234,0.0002,2.5845,4.0454,1.0437,5.8679,4.3473,4.5442,3.3667,2.0549,4.1642,1.1787,3.2646,0.0874,1.9959,3.701,0.6903,2.7159,0.6845,2.472,4.6097,3.4029,0.0948,0.9393,0.6793,3.326,4.3359,4.7505,0.2381,0.703,3.3291,0.4185,4.9477,2.6188,0.0379,0.5492,7.0867,2.9685,3.451,1.0285,6.1289,1.8557,2.9099,1.8035,0.0209,5.3542,4.8267,0.5048,1.37,2.172,1.6543,0.1242,0.3463,2.3834,6.6711,1.4099,1.0723,1.0269,9.0749,4.1432,0.5485,0.965,0.0003,2.5911,0.4522,3.7528,0.0707,4.7974,1.7234,5.2449,0.2858,4.1925,4.6523,3.0065,1.3587,0.2559,4.1196,4.1718,4.0219,2.0236,2.0899,3.7306,7.3966,5.2638,3.7335,8.5429,4.4018,6.46,2.2633,3.1647,0.0857,4.2595,3.2024,0.5517,1.3218,2.2855,0.7554,2.2273,3.44,4.3226,6.4984,1.6301,1.2334,1.4749,5.183,0.0021,3.6985,1.1191,6.3044,4.6035,4.1326,0.4537,0.7679,0.0003,2.7823,3.1092,1.9857,1.0324,4.1641,0.8947,2.6961,0.4143,3.7587,0.8162,2.8886,0.2888,1.1141,0.7502,8.2506,1.1861,3.4782,6.5875,4.3532,3.6283,8.8725,0.3725,2.4452,0.4864,6.9843,4.0843,0.7903,3.9832,3.6965,1.7108,2.3364,5.9401,4.4855,1.0975,0.0003,4.7931,3.228,4.9532,5.8361,0.2319,4.3767,1.9588,4.5008,9.9587,4.4473,2.1924,4.2372,0.0615,2.3325,1.5657,4.5334,2.2492,0.1478,3.3456,3.7254,1.252,0.0005,1.9392,2.5588,2.6906,3.7622,1.3338,5.4055,0.2011,3.0699,5.1343,4.3751,0.0353,3.6428,1.0489,5.8201,2.7322,1.6112,2.7753,3.5237,7.5507,5.0435,0.5676,6.3195,2.9876,0.6397,3.7344,4.8075,3.7584,2.6329,0.0775,1.7447,6.8481,5.6866,3.1427,3.6395,1.203,1.0006,5.4475,1.7134,0.6659,4.6816,5.55,7.1555,1.5354,0.6841,1.8657,5.4348,0.3087,0.0014,1.7959]}
{"id":2069,"ended":true,"length":567,"text":"Scare me... with an Easter bunny... maybe on the prowl for someone to kidnap... I suppose... I didn't see any, and while I was hoping they would have been out, I suppose I can see how Easter presents itself as being safer for those of us who are so sensitive...\n\nI didn't see much out last Saturday either, but Sunday, I walked out to my favorite little meadow to see how much of the snow had melted, and there he was... only a couple of hundred feet from where I'd parked...\n\nHi and welcome to the world of bunnies! I have several pet bunnies - there was a time when I had them all here but a few are gone now.\n\nYes, I too love bunnies too (I had to go in to correct myself a bit there - I love ALL animals, including all animals that are cute and that make me smile ). I have had several, including a lovely pair of Easter Eggers and I also have two beautiful long eared, long legged little Lops.\n\nI just want them all, but then I will have to take more than a tiny 2 bedroom apartment. Oh well... it would take a lot more than a tiny apartment to keep out bunnies... right? LOL\n\nMama,\nThe Bunny was standing only a few feet from where you parked, and was completely at ease, and yet, I was scared half witless by its mere presence.\nThat would be a huge apartment for bunnies and me, we'd both surely go crazy.\n\nIt is too bad this isn't a forum thing to put the photos right on the post. I think I'll put them on my blog though, and then maybe I can give someone who wants to see the photos a link to them. I'll have to see what else might come up to do that. I'd still like to get that bunny in the next post.\n\nMy dear little bunnies are all safely tucked in bed, and tucked in for a lovely, warm and cosy night's sleep. I must leave things for them to do when they wake tomorrow. I can't bear to be up too early and see that they are not where I left them.\n\nI have been going out a lot and there is just not a lot of interest in the garden. So much snow. At least the cats need to be fed. And I love the rabbits. They remind me of my childhood and when my dad gave me a rabbit when I was very little. When he came home one time drunk he took off the rabbit's collar and gave him to me as an Easter bunn. I had that bunny through the years and then when I was living in Texas I put him on the porch so he would be safe from the weather. When there are no bunnies around I am always worried something has happened to them and there is a hollow silence in these parts.","token_len":609,"entropy":[6.5,4.6274,6.154,6.4054,4.4733,8.9116,3.5342,3.0266,6.783,6.3049,1.9111,7.1526,0.0017,0.8827,5.3142,1.4844,4.7531,3.2958,3.0473,5.2319,2.6043,2.4912,5.3269,0.0008,3.4579,2.3888,4.9993,2.9142,5.7598,0.5641,2.364,5.2012,3.1441,1.7809,3.5248,2.7989,5.1422,2.5726,0.7764,4.9189,1.2952,3.6087,3.2158,2.6569,10.0612,6.8259,5.5482,2.8,4.4738,7.6527,2.3269,3.7464,2.7534,0.1636,0.5462,1.8798,5.7847,4.6909,3.619,2.3395,0.0982,3.0133,4.6828,0.0007,1.8116,3.8831,5.8655,8.0926,5.2468,4.5383,0.8162,1.2334,6.7784,2.6594,1.1706,6.3836,2.6001,2.1316,2.1476,3.9634,5.4507,8.0145,0.1631,3.5256,1.7374,2.5517,2.8372,3.0332,1.6123,4.4614,0.9198,1.9427,2.6933,0.6809,4.1286,7.0911,0.2643,2.1389,5.7575,2.0764,2.1105,0.8775,2.9826,1.1844,1.0987,0.9168,0.2698,2.0836,3.3184,3.443,2.2292,0.0002,8.2945,5.621,0.4795,0.473,1.3815,4.2831,0.0566,7.0218,0.5683,0.0034,1.3916,1.687,3.5698,6.0019,6.3014,2.2249,0.0006,0.0004,5.446,5.307,4.1566,1.5388,5.6201,0.5334,0.7814,2.5599,4.0741,1.6681,5.5196,3.8582,4.7656,0.8041,4.5437,3.0155,0.8312,1.0789,2.9059,0.0002,6.864,0.3409,1.4629,8.6581,3.5692,2.393,0.0044,0.0023,5.5204,4.6462,2.5302,4.4109,2.5384,3.6937,4.5815,1.9818,8.2881,3.3952,3.2241,1.1827,5.846,3.3212,1.4958,3.9428,9.6338,2.7149,1.7152,3.1669,4.8717,2.978,1.8767,1.45,3.8002,1.293,5.019,4.0535,0.9265,2.7415,5.8538,1.9059,2.4642,3.6514,2.8896,4.311,3.2264,1.431,4.8518,5.3337,0.462,8.0559,8.4836,4.1699,2.8061,3.7831,3.8252,0.7441,2.408,4.6057,6.908,7.4444,3.2936,3.6207,4.0359,4.8637,0.067,5.0531,7.8786,7.6618,4.9854,0.9682,0.0002,1.8216,4.8844,2.5183,4.5487,1.5724,3.9669,2.6703,6.2991,1.6493,3.9523,1.5399,0.2102,3.5107,5.061,3.6349,2.2872,5.7107,8.5668,8.0001,2.6539,2.6371,5.2382,0.9127,2.7053,4.5283,3.2571,3.1668,1.2639,1.0589,1.8254,1.2699,2.024,2.1687,2.8266,1.0314,3.7596,6.9349,4.9707,0.0189,0.0025,3.3391,6.367,0.2861,7.9712,1.4156,0.0003,5.9459,4.223,1.9349,4.5826,18.091,4.1589,5.7084,6.3676,7.5979,0.687,0.7084,0.2929,0.8182,1.4093,5.4201,1.4622,1.8672,1.5078,3.5083,5.6269,6.0685,1.4757,2.5705,2.1791,6.2024,2.64,2.5051,2.1969,4.1368,9.6629,15.0255,4.3193,3.4053,4.7591,6.3108,0.5211,0.4195,1.6923,18.7303,4.7603,0.9222,2.1667,4.9923,11.5554,1.5103,4.0041,0.0062,0.0022,3.7844,5.5991,1.5137,5.4999,2.5006,3.1898,7.5605,4.6945,2.6528,2.3892,0.8999,0.0002,3.5703,3.2347,5.2915,2.2406,3.718,5.4381,0.0006,1.5848,7.8541,7.2417,3.5099,5.0223,4.3544,7.6701,6.1175,3.0303,1.5674,4.3983,1.4093,1.5084,3.573,1.7269,2.0182,3.7319,1.3987,1.5647,1.8432,1.8255,5.7599,1.1197,2.4887,3.0738,3.3685,1.9004,1.153,4.46,5.3032,3.6766,3.4543,0.3316,2.0435,2.2991,2.1993,1.0122,4.1815,0.4245,2.7465,1.4032,2.2151,2.3558,3.3562,0.5946,2.3317,1.8803,4.5187,5.5917,2.6185,1.3966,4.1388,3.8198,1.9008,0.7378,2.4579,3.2658,5.4386,0.8657,0.2597,2.9769,4.9489,3.0156,3.0869,1.7771,4.2532,3.4404,1.5718,0.6594,0.0003,4.6285,4.7872,3.4706,2.9076,0.0721,0.044,3.9953,3.0045,8.203,2.3114,2.1617,5.8578,1.4838,1.4726,6.6185,1.5811,4.1425,1.8944,5.7659,3.053,2.7163,3.5777,6.2686,0.0291,1.7131,5.917,0.7174,0.636,2.2676,5.7559,5.2362,6.4055,2.5551,3.9024,0.8431,2.696,4.0102,1.6318,2.0702,5.8839,1.2359,2.2641,3.2293,0.8155,5.2542,0.5355,2.78,5.4649,2.2901,2.3515,2.7012,4.684,3.9676,4.489,1.7154,3.7446,8.0372,1.8859,5.4001,0.0379,0.9493,0.804,0.0003,2.1624,3.0805,2.5316,4.4467,1.9331,3.8294,1.25,4.0559,4.7613,1.4114,4.1547,2.376,2.0921,0.5292,1.1773,5.5665,0.7792,2.4445,7.8443,1.5607,3.9175,4.228,4.9444,2.6092,6.5599,0.4688,3.2568,7.5797,5.2721,1.4677,1.5923,3.958,1.011,3.4462,1.871,3.8449,1.7297,5.0851,1.2807,2.2432,5.9535,0.0114,0.4299,1.6818,4.0451,2.5938,5.5192,3.3696,2.4359,3.7429,0.4111,1.1277,2.951,4.5575,0.6267,0.028,3.8117,1.2587,0.5771,5.1749,1.6561,3.8475,0.7061,4.1325,3.341,10.5971,2.6688,3.8629,3.1266,2.6197,2.7366,1.813,3.4992,0.5791,3.1772,3.9324,0.8819,1.0907,3.6428,2.9711,2.4787,7.312,0.0359,8.8832,1.6025,3.6425,5.4396,2.377,7.5325,1.5016,3.4823,1.1376,4.582,3.5007,0.6967,1.5618,5.9847,1.1159,5.6013,1.4024,5.2509,2.2054,2.2271,1.7568,3.9847,3.4014,1.0257,1.9706,2.1737,2.6144,2.372,1.0427,4.4914,0.6181,3.5872,5.2524,3.0135,1.6372,2.0311,0.0089,0.0033,2.2588,1.2497,3.5688,2.5613,3.5608,6.8253,4.9416,0.859,0.9195,1.9813,2.1986,4.7621,0.7691,2.2102,11.5158,9.1376,2.0158,6.1037,3.8522,0.6272]}
{"id":3223,"ended":true,"length":573,"text":"The hero bursts into the villain's lair, ready to fight, but the villain is having family troubles - so they have to reschedule their showdown.\n\nThe hero is a bumbling amateur. The villain a master manipulator. The world the heroes inhabit is an impossible fantasy world made of nonsense. The villain's family, the world's only remaining \"real\" family, is on the verge of disappearing; the hero must defeat not just the villain, but the universe, if they're going to win the ultimate round.\n\nThe villain has kidnapped a princess and is threatening to kill her. That means the hero has only two options. One is to keep up the bumbling hero routine, which will only last until her death. The other is to work to save not only her but the entire universe - at the risk of her own life.\n\nWhat's a superhero to do?\n\nHe'd better use his noodle.\n\nThe villain is cooking up a new ingredient for a secret recipe. It's more than just any other substance he can get his hands on, with a little bit of this, or that. It's going to change and destroy the world. It depends on how the hero manages it.\n\nYou see, the villain is a very, very strange chemist. He knows just how to add the right elements to the wrong substances and it will take only the tiniest drop to bring the whole structure of the world right down.\n\nTo save his daughter's life, the only thing the hero can do is figure out just what the villain is making and use the ingredients in just the right order.\n\nHow will he do it? What can he do to turn these elements into the correct order?\n\nHe needs to find out who's in charge of this operation, but to do that he'll have to figure out what the villain's plan really is. And how can he do that without telling the villain who he is... and what he is?\n\nThis is the first book in The World Eater trilogy, and is a lighthearted and fun book full of humor, thrills, and some serious science.\n\nA little bit of history: In the 1930s, the physicist Max Planck was so appalled by racism and bigotry that he committed suicide. Later, an article of his was published. It contains an axiom at the start, and a famous quotation by a black scientist, which reads: \"The more one knows, the less one knows.\"\n\nThis quote is taken directly from the article, and became my inspiration for the book.\n\nThe heroine of my book is trying to figure out the plan. She's not trying to hurt him, but she can't very well allow another person to commit such a crime as mass murder - and the world's mass murderer, at that. She needs to figure it out. She needs the clues. The rest of the story is how she gets them, and how she uses them.","token_len":611,"entropy":[9.4567,10.7106,0.9564,1.7124,7.5423,0.426,0.8709,1.1511,6.1134,0.1099,4.1283,3.0764,0.9949,2.2516,1.2404,2.2445,6.1122,10.606,2.8561,6.7462,3.5712,3.4433,3.3878,0.7254,9.7579,1.3762,0.0009,1.5222,6.3964,0.6896,1.8874,0.0019,2.0404,2.3805,2.6415,3.5296,6.4643,0.8855,6.3624,5.0774,2.9516,0.8464,8.1237,3.9385,2.4468,0.001,0.6199,0.8621,5.206,6.6496,3.0404,2.8259,0.4581,4.2116,4.9857,4.1021,2.373,6.131,1.454,7.6329,1.0334,2.0574,3.5819,2.5507,4.684,2.8397,2.3307,3.3469,1.6995,4.441,3.9599,6.2695,2.5279,0.2541,2.1207,0.323,1.1537,4.4836,0.5898,1.0325,0.0057,4.8891,5.9673,1.823,1.1775,2.0279,4.7963,9.3757,1.7281,0.637,0.3269,1.0375,0.0253,1.111,5.0832,2.9015,4.8955,2.8682,2.8418,0.5049,0.016,5.0739,2.655,4.984,8.7579,0.7903,0.4514,0.0005,1.6892,3.0033,2.5671,6.7473,2.3206,3.5326,1.4764,1.7086,3.6021,0.4882,1.4795,0.112,1.1071,5.7918,3.6183,1.626,0.5002,1.975,5.8018,2.2378,0.556,1.7396,4.0055,0.6276,0.115,4.8515,6.5982,0.8292,5.2088,0.1521,5.6721,6.8463,1.0773,2.6928,3.1305,2.8465,4.288,1.4476,5.6666,1.9771,0.9104,0.402,0.2744,0.4044,0.0493,5.7756,2.5947,2.0663,8.7262,0.897,1.7748,2.3974,1.0285,2.4928,0.7397,3.2474,5.4537,1.4686,4.3738,0.0152,2.4307,1.4949,0.5645,0.3952,0.542,0.0003,4.5111,2.4651,3.5217,4.4213,0.6643,0.0383,0.5051,1.2896,0.0003,6.1517,5.0541,2.0161,4.8745,0.5062,12.6528,0.075,2.9916,1.1178,0.0003,2.2483,2.9806,1.7981,9.7618,1.5384,0.7092,2.5346,8.8375,1.9565,2.4787,5.6842,3.3348,1.4476,3.0139,0.5812,6.3739,1.76,1.2779,5.7387,1.7963,5.5736,3.1742,2.0483,3.516,0.1373,0.017,0.0034,1.8404,6.0095,2.2748,2.9979,2.8679,0.0424,6.5351,3.9538,4.4609,1.205,1.1292,1.5329,0.4375,5.4559,0.033,3.0121,6.8199,5.2548,0.9221,0.8609,0.8255,2.8712,8.6788,0.353,1.5236,2.2592,1.9289,2.4569,3.1487,0.4231,0.6004,0.0002,4.2731,2.8949,0.1433,1.3138,1.4868,1.4736,2.0906,4.0433,3.8959,0.01,5.9969,9.0018,0.5199,0.8263,3.7511,4.8552,1.6143,0.3775,6.3247,4.0789,2.2698,6.2093,0.5812,2.0546,2.5754,4.0801,2.5338,4.6157,1.921,3.3387,5.023,3.1949,9.4007,0.0023,0.0002,4.7211,2.7774,3.6147,1.6521,3.6711,7.5555,1.3533,0.5813,1.3167,4.3515,2.8377,2.3211,1.2699,0.0002,4.6077,5.145,1.9114,3.5848,1.9891,0.0581,0.1955,0.7566,7.0683,1.9227,1.6076,0.8687,0.9873,0.1127,0.1536,6.8364,0.0846,4.8179,1.6565,1.6251,3.2236,1.7274,3.8861,2.5569,3.0367,2.5691,1.5781,2.873,6.5551,0.7907,0.0249,3.1,0.5405,0.9764,0.0002,3.9553,3.7085,2.0532,1.3541,0.6634,0.0643,5.166,3.8152,0.5623,0.2904,1.1326,5.3083,5.0605,3.5863,0.7116,2.5441,3.2329,7.5432,0.6414,0.8241,0.0002,2.5878,3.6787,0.6032,2.1209,1.5726,5.0533,2.5222,3.3121,0.1131,1.0918,1.9074,4.5864,1.5677,4.0291,4.9559,0.5526,0.7564,0.8019,2.0421,0.9135,0.014,2.7308,0.1791,2.0103,1.5794,1.8753,2.1907,2.5225,4.1669,0.0418,0.3114,2.7782,3.7424,3.5894,0.3702,1.414,1.0987,1.4387,6.0412,0.5714,2.0247,2.8357,2.1577,0.7528,6.8407,2.0568,2.4027,1.2536,2.9194,3.4838,0.2512,0.0003,3.8366,0.9394,1.6096,3.8364,3.4181,0.3863,3.4536,4.337,7.8496,4.4343,1.5079,1.0428,3.752,2.7762,7.1229,1.844,2.9362,2.6643,3.1934,5.3396,0.0017,2.8907,1.3619,6.8452,0.01,0.6694,0.5099,4.0197,4.0076,3.4737,1.4305,1.0842,0.0003,4.0838,3.895,1.6177,0.3474,3.7101,2.3944,3.2222,1.4113,3.9832,0.1214,0.306,1.4969,7.0083,5.0027,0.8807,0.0,2.4026,6.311,5.9012,0.3052,9.5654,1.4883,3.3817,0.5017,0.057,6.3991,0.4113,0.9155,5.6458,0.8023,5.135,4.6337,5.0713,2.0598,1.7489,0.4856,4.7403,2.3653,6.9561,2.8851,9.2832,0.0245,6.5206,0.14,3.6822,2.9453,2.4669,2.4907,6.479,4.5931,3.785,3.0658,3.815,1.668,1.7892,3.0801,4.2555,0.8201,0.5135,2.3039,4.1554,4.9034,4.0282,1.8673,0.0259,1.574,0.1758,1.4301,1.2957,0.539,0.0003,3.1174,2.8595,1.3931,4.1878,2.6252,0.0509,1.0852,3.3857,1.3313,1.242,7.4275,6.6631,5.1886,0.4782,1.5675,0.748,0.6675,1.1285,0.0002,1.9127,7.5538,1.8033,5.4424,1.2541,0.7757,7.9358,0.0875,2.5973,0.0333,2.8235,4.9979,2.0543,1.229,1.3004,2.9806,3.4137,0.0313,5.8616,5.4363,0.8439,1.2189,1.4442,4.1689,0.2777,8.012,0.0575,6.4775,7.0387,1.5221,0.1952,7.9073,1.7981,0.5928,1.913,5.0262,9.0537,0.0792,4.1054,1.878,2.774,3.5097,2.6698,8.8694,1.6103,2.2447,5.0976,1.6033,0.8226,2.3862,2.9073,0.4564,1.7451,3.3736,0.0603,1.1044,2.4401,1.6335,3.4684,5.3928,1.3685,3.1457,6.0022,0.9313,0.5291,1.4307,0.9351,6.3545,0.9235,2.834,2.9865,2.069,1.0928,1.0213,0.5393,3.3769,0.249,1.1338]}
{"id":642,"ended":false,"length":570,"text":"Get to Know a Mod # 21 : SurvivorType!\n\nSurvivorTYPE\n\nI\u2019m a 28 year old gamer, writer, and developer. I have been working as a game tester in the video game industry since 2013 and since then I have developed a passion for writing and editing content; mostly on the video game industry. My main passion for gaming began with the release of the NES back in the early 80s. Since then, I have never missed an HD remake of a video game franchise, and my gaming experience ranges from classic platformers up to the latest AAA titles. My favorite platform currently is the PS4, but I have grown to really enjoy Nintendo\u2019s first party titles as well; with a recent favorite being the Kingdom Hearts series. I also make it a mission to try as many games in development as possible.\n\nIf you can\u2019t tell by my username, I love Survivor. That\u2019s right, I love that weird, wacky, creepy, and spooky reality game series that premiered back in 1986. Survivor\u2018s long and storied history, as well as its vast array of spinoff series, is one that I\u2019m really passionate about covering. I cover all aspects of Survivor. If it\u2019s the television show, the various spinoff television series and television films, the various spinoff video games, or even just something I find of interest. My latest passion is working towards developing a Survivor RPG of my own. (No, not the web game; I need to expand my skillset a bit more before actually trying to publish anything.)\n\nAside from my passion for Survivor, I also enjoy a good mystery. So many mystery novels are just poorly written, but ones written in the style of the genre\u2019s early 20th century masters, like Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle are fantastic.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not playing video games, writing, or analyzing something I find interesting, I\u2019m working. So far I\u2019ve been playing with a little bit of web development to test the waters before I really dive in hard. The idea is that I would be working as a game tester, writer, editor, art director, and possibly a programmer at various studios, and I\u2019m planning on pursuing it for a long time. My eventual goal is to break into the game development in a more permanent way, but I\u2019m not holding my breath; I need to put in some more work first. In the meantime, I plan to keep writing articles about the gaming experience, the TV show, or whatever interests me.\n\nAs with any new job, I also need to learn the ropes, which means playing a ton of games while I\u2019m still getting an idea of what I will be working with. In the meantime, I hope you all enjoy my articles here. If there are any topics you\u2019d like me to address, let me know!","token_len":614,"entropy":[3.7022,3.4563,4.5574,7.838,7.8163,9.0329,4.9307,10.2597,11.0895,6.6921,1.3051,0.0798,2.951,0.0191,0.0208,7.952,3.3189,0.0003,5.1416,13.2319,7.5881,4.8103,1.6447,8.9533,0.5462,0.0729,5.1861,1.9837,5.8152,0.505,0.9347,4.5045,1.0198,0.676,2.4055,1.1599,2.4447,3.0935,0.2806,3.2556,8.1646,0.0074,3.4819,1.5987,3.7809,0.2028,0.4864,1.6912,3.7212,2.0273,5.1613,1.1758,0.8827,0.4951,4.0942,1.6219,4.6255,0.0824,4.3161,1.315,4.1087,3.8514,8.0043,5.3137,3.339,2.0254,4.506,0.1083,2.4224,0.9067,3.3505,2.3899,2.0549,3.2906,3.4134,5.0432,2.0374,1.8056,3.1847,0.0169,1.8545,6.7657,4.5064,0.0527,2.295,1.5637,2.4792,1.6812,0.9387,3.1246,0.0785,1.6839,0.261,0.3489,6.7581,3.6825,2.0592,10.7659,3.8544,1.0589,1.4354,1.7916,0.0115,6.1088,1.5353,1.6116,3.335,4.8794,2.4475,7.0432,0.1237,5.3839,4.9702,0.7128,7.3702,0.2183,2.4742,2.6254,3.4018,0.8466,0.7468,3.1951,3.544,6.1561,9.9739,0.7026,1.3211,2.89,0.8668,1.2825,2.3644,0.829,1.8584,6.7572,1.0749,5.5007,0.4615,6.4875,16.0482,1.578,0.9844,6.4281,6.5152,2.8743,2.0847,0.1176,5.1009,4.8282,3.3467,4.4101,9.0338,0.3274,2.3346,5.8639,0.0645,0.7373,0.5114,1.3895,2.3915,5.3147,4.7706,1.6657,5.855,0.2984,4.5684,5.3123,0.1158,1.9758,4.7424,3.7826,0.1994,0.4423,2.2519,1.4415,0.0003,4.4459,0.0966,5.1855,7.6624,0.4979,0.0078,3.5185,3.0485,3.3323,4.6507,0.9028,0.8334,4.6015,7.4532,3.1657,5.1931,4.6516,0.1309,0.2964,2.6885,0.7182,0.6845,1.8978,5.9842,10.4944,2.8113,6.5331,0.0581,1.1632,5.6319,1.1736,1.2992,6.4718,0.0495,6.4038,4.9499,4.5056,1.9169,8.2375,3.8415,0.0572,5.8805,0.5409,2.7305,5.2043,8.6545,3.7431,6.4421,2.918,3.0988,0.0102,0.142,3.8619,2.6726,0.2161,0.0062,1.4387,7.0041,3.7469,0.0036,6.4375,2.1121,2.9225,0.9243,2.4107,2.5963,2.2374,1.2733,5.8998,0.2334,0.0705,3.3566,3.4304,0.0221,7.577,0.5719,1.3825,7.8308,3.0336,2.0563,0.0288,1.947,3.0123,3.8614,4.6903,1.1157,0.1013,0.0134,3.8915,9.2928,0.5251,1.6463,3.8064,7.5667,4.1642,0.4532,4.6519,1.0025,3.046,5.5527,4.9318,0.8019,1.518,4.1582,3.3556,0.0829,2.715,0.4418,0.4433,3.0477,1.4849,1.9162,5.8315,2.6682,5.0275,7.7746,1.1706,5.0479,3.6179,5.5685,5.46,0.761,4.9125,6.5405,4.133,1.4886,3.7688,5.7335,5.9002,0.9303,0.0071,0.7576,6.0203,5.3689,1.4398,2.3954,1.9444,6.615,2.8935,4.6887,0.8738,6.4885,0.8714,5.5123,0.9947,4.3963,4.6888,4.4713,0.4784,2.8459,4.4065,7.7737,4.5277,1.6949,3.7984,3.0752,1.2923,0.7165,0.0003,7.8525,0.0154,2.1084,4.0195,0.2765,1.9444,0.2996,0.3634,1.4126,2.4127,3.9718,4.0442,8.0595,3.3601,5.0759,2.7362,3.884,5.4378,3.1906,5.111,8.2008,0.46,1.3657,3.1501,7.8803,5.3372,2.5935,1.6819,1.5852,0.1227,2.1929,3.7814,9.4698,0.9458,1.075,7.6398,4.0721,0.79,0.0807,7.7891,2.2881,2.5249,7.8402,0.286,0.0494,2.163,4.5233,1.0172,0.0031,4.6125,5.1199,0.8549,3.1536,0.0003,4.8483,0.5994,5.1191,0.0424,0.0125,2.6085,2.9482,3.3701,0.1433,0.3757,6.2093,0.8996,0.4785,6.9255,4.5948,3.0197,3.3161,0.7011,0.4591,0.3597,0.8187,0.027,0.0526,3.4289,6.764,4.5052,2.5052,1.2639,2.0834,0.0229,3.8022,1.362,2.7399,5.1092,1.4826,5.0646,1.5046,0.0984,8.0503,0.9633,4.0249,5.4043,2.6443,1.0246,4.6428,1.6664,5.4559,2.4763,1.7421,8.1683,0.4387,3.7839,3.9699,1.1719,1.1338,0.8333,2.7592,4.2083,4.1431,3.6002,0.3083,3.3094,0.3488,0.0001,1.803,5.8602,0.2197,3.1651,0.1934,6.9775,0.6924,0.1592,1.4262,3.8497,2.3615,3.4645,3.6299,6.0624,5.1668,2.0809,1.981,1.636,3.114,0.0212,0.2617,6.6403,1.0401,5.9493,3.5159,3.6654,1.2633,1.9638,0.1427,0.3872,3.7955,8.6438,0.3865,0.3886,0.1537,5.5731,1.0294,0.9114,1.265,1.679,8.7775,1.3457,5.1226,5.8744,0.9911,1.0869,2.6099,1.0866,1.3392,0.0217,0.1557,1.7473,6.0553,1.7437,0.1394,4.8853,0.636,4.8799,0.4267,5.0433,2.0267,1.5408,3.318,2.1147,4.8526,0.8232,4.2519,1.1672,0.2457,0.1999,0.4804,5.319,0.7682,3.6757,2.4706,4.1765,2.0733,1.987,5.4272,4.1718,1.5234,4.2285,5.6675,0.4274,0.2452,2.7026,2.2789,7.9189,0.1469,1.669,0.8991,0.0003,3.6755,3.8528,1.1621,2.8055,3.078,0.495,1.3417,4.4373,3.0587,0.34,3.6095,2.8167,2.3685,2.5902,3.5852,2.5974,5.3474,2.3225,4.7044,0.0858,1.3454,4.7596,1.3059,2.1567,0.041,0.0287,2.1777,4.5649,5.7348,1.7461,0.8849,0.2617,0.8698,3.618,0.5986,1.9602,5.1438,0.5096,3.5316,1.4065,0.3012,0.1003,0.2642,2.6616,1.5,2.4489,0.8085,1.7984,3.065,5.8663,1.986,2.5909,3.8236,1.2347,0.2188,5.2093,0.77,4.6735,0.2261,1.2872,0.1385,3.8487,3.7797,5.0747,0.2801,2.6043,0.0172,0.0037,2.0827]}
{"id":1631,"ended":true,"length":566,"text":"You're driving home at night, and you notice something moving in the backseat from the rear-view mirror...\n\nThe car is a new one, and you want a perfect first service.\n\nSo what do you do? Is it a spider? A bear? A human, perhaps?\n\nIn \"A New Way To Drive,\" author James Wilsdon looks at the world we live in. And at the stories we tell.\n\nIt's easy to make jokes about how Americans have little interest in science and technology, and how we'll all be toast when we turn into a bunch of zombie-like cyborgs. Wilsdon doesn't buy that argument. In his book, he argues that science fiction not only helps us learn how to live in the future, but gives us an insider's perspective on a world that we may never have much of a chance to understand.\n\n\"The idea that we will all have our brains wired into our cars, all our electronics in our homes, all our furniture will have wires coming out of it... is pure scifi fantasy,\" Wilsdon told me recently. \"But the idea that we will drive electric cars, and drive them in much safer ways... certainly is the next step forward. And as long as we can keep our heads, it will benefit us.\"\n\nWilsdon says there's a huge market for science fiction -- both as entertainment and as a tool for thought.\n\n\"There's only been a handful of times in history when science fiction has been taken so seriously that the government has had a program to produce military vehicles from [it] in order to protect the United States from these things\" Wilsdon says. \"And that's happened only a handful of times, so if anybody can predict the next step, it's science fiction as well.\"\n\nThe author of other books, including the Hugo-winning \"Sapiens\" explores the intersection of science and society in a recent interview.\n\n\"We know very, very little about the world we're living in,\" Wilsdon says. \"We still think ourselves to be a little bit special. Like we're the only creatures on the planet that have civilization and science and technology and math and things like that. And actually we're not. We're part of a much larger ecosystem at this level, and a lot of those living systems are interacting.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for us? Well, Wilsdon argues that it's our responsibility to start making some of those assumptions about the world. And he says he'll be here to help every step of the way.\n\n\"If we can all kind of take some responsibility for making the world better, we can avoid turning into a bunch of zombies and cyborgs,\" Wilsdon says with a laugh.\n\n\"A New Way To Drive\" is out now in hardcover and Kindle.\n\nThis interview was condensed and edited for clarity.

{"id":912,"ended":false,"length":563,"text":"Sunday Free Write : Boatswain Edition\n\nThe second book I read after I finished The Fifth Season was The Boatswain\u2019s Daughter, by Laini Taylor. This book explores the relationship between the world of magic and the mundane world of people (more specifically those of the nobility), so it\u2019s the natural next step for me, seeing as I was already in the mood for epic fantasy. I\u2019d started to rewatch The Tudors while I was waiting for The Fifth Season to come out, so I had plenty of period drama to use to support my reading. Needless to say, this book made a much better read to this already great TV show. Taylor has created a world with tons of intrigue, with characters you\u2019re constantly worried about, and more than a few people you\u2019ll fall hard for. I was surprised by both the pace of the action and the lack of any sort of action there was to begin with, with the exception of small skirmishes or fights for small details of power. I also liked that the magic and abilities of the human kingdom have been developed to the point where you can really see the difference between the magic-users and the rest of society. It would make me hate my job if I worked in the court of a medieval king\/queen. In both this book and The Seventh Tower, it\u2019s obvious how much knowledge of the other world would serve the reader to understand the world that Taylor and Christopher Paolini have created.\n\nOverall, I liked The Boatswain\u2019s Daughter a lot. There seemed to be a little bit more action than in The Fifth Season too, although I might have just been reading faster because I was enjoying it. If you enjoyed The Fifth Season, I would definitely recommend you check out The Boatswain\u2019s Daughter.\n\nThis book will be read alongside the first book in The First Law trilogy, The Blade Itself. Which I hope to be starting in the next week or so as well.\n\n4 Responses\n\nI loved The Fifth Season and was surprised by the lack of action too. It\u2019s not as much fantasy as it is magic realism. I hope you enjoy the other two books at least as much as I enjoyed those!\n\nI thought you\u2019d like this story after reading The Fifth Season, especially since in a way, The Fifth Season deals with the same thing. I liked your analogy of it being like watching Tudors haha. In the latter books the action and intensity is definitely ramped up. The series will end up making you hate your job though, so maybe you should find one now so the series won\u2019t have as much of an effect on you.\n\nI do have an idea for a story which would follow the theme and characters of this one, but I\u2019m not sure yet whether I\u2019ll actually write it. If I do, I\u2019ll definitely let you know!","token_len":617,"entropy":[9.1178,12.6624,9.188,9.2648,4.0522,5.6366,0.2033,8.237,1.585,0.0554,3.6087,6.1079,3.2168,5.1194,2.7916,4.5081,3.5158,1.2321,3.0439,7.3208,5.0495,1.3351,1.5599,4.7253,0.0256,0.0304,0.0056,12.085,10.6586,4.0609,6.1811,1.6356,2.1441,5.4322,5.0154,4.1179,6.5455,0.7851,2.973,1.2525,4.9363,0.7107,2.8657,0.1331,1.9275,5.4252,0.696,7.1431,0.1737,0.7774,5.4384,1.7517,0.146,5.1007,5.0854,5.7041,1.7368,4.8211,1.249,1.9193,6.1691,2.4482,5.5547,2.1292,14.1529,1.5588,0.0054,4.4111,6.8593,4.0494,0.1663,0.8368,1.5293,3.9644,4.6952,1.7409,1.4154,2.7213,3.1716,3.4015,1.5587,5.2207,0.3844,6.697,0.4007,1.1357,2.141,3.7423,0.1266,0.6397,7.0209,2.4366,5.4369,3.0444,2.7291,8.0894,0.2711,5.2067,1.3484,0.1821,4.353,0.3071,2.3753,1.957,0.1259,1.3869,2.0115,0.4545,1.0107,1.6214,0.6177,3.2221,4.5098,0.1554,10.9288,4.0489,0.9187,6.1946,2.1789,6.3869,1.0083,3.2568,1.6832,7.1681,0.0019,0.0008,0.1921,2.5205,1.0155,4.6748,3.1101,6.2863,0.9767,3.4829,4.9313,5.6083,8.0507,3.5884,6.9358,0.7434,0.969,8.5341,3.5927,3.8238,0.6555,2.5492,3.4402,6.1713,0.0383,5.0759,0.9633,5.0106,3.4224,4.9202,4.4858,1.4816,3.7138,6.9244,6.2201,0.0544,1.0937,0.9034,5.3994,2.5012,2.2222,1.1023,3.9705,1.2717,1.0347,0.0159,1.7143,6.3137,7.0652,0.187,0.596,2.1788,2.9115,4.0219,1.8602,6.0805,0.8678,4.7605,0.7727,0.551,5.9898,0.4612,0.4531,5.2785,0.0992,3.683,3.2911,0.0013,4.7684,6.4164,3.5605,3.4334,4.2451,0.0302,1.324,4.4926,1.5943,6.3687,0.0328,7.4413,2.2918,0.034,3.7554,4.0276,5.5766,5.7816,5.0659,4.8505,4.8367,0.9825,2.0263,3.0556,2.3374,1.4433,1.5036,4.4768,3.2135,8.7521,1.2875,0.7031,6.3345,5.7087,4.2805,1.3235,4.7066,2.5337,2.2138,0.1745,0.5238,2.5021,1.2614,3.9732,1.7559,1.5653,2.7527,0.319,1.8648,3.0094,5.8665,3.7833,0.5633,0.3683,4.3259,0.09,3.3949,0.7932,2.6895,5.5309,3.2173,3.8554,7.3324,3.3743,6.1595,1.8179,0.5186,6.1953,1.8272,1.7416,9.5536,0.4352,1.6302,6.165,1.6839,6.9532,5.9472,0.0265,1.8884,4.4635,5.5719,5.1179,0.3215,0.1392,1.5439,5.9306,6.4836,0.6889,3.1576,2.2333,0.095,0.0372,6.4992,3.1216,1.6577,6.8623,4.4531,1.1367,5.4928,1.9725,5.0736,7.0552,2.1565,3.0312,3.7174,2.3207,1.4326,1.5372,3.6763,3.3794,3.7897,9.0742,6.0492,0.0036,2.0288,0.3083,0.3796,2.0478,0.0011,4.5008,0.8338,1.1774,3.7119,2.0633,1.6454,0.0005,0.0019,0.0002,1.6009,0.0036,0.0024,0.0039,2.3128,0.1258,1.0809,3.6794,5.3237,0.1056,0.0202,0.7606,4.1232,1.1745,2.3279,4.6116,2.4311,2.6357,1.4137,0.7091,0.1282,7.3822,0.4503,4.4179,1.4199,5.667,0.8503,4.2836,1.3149,3.4017,7.8193,2.9097,1.0499,1.3022,4.6288,2.6629,1.7613,4.092,0.6988,3.2508,1.2409,1.4447,0.0869,0.6419,2.0725,1.7535,2.4779,0.1326,3.1198,0.9728,0.7806,1.5213,0.7693,0.0007,0.0042,0.0005,0.8615,0.0062,0.0044,0.0144,1.3536,1.4888,0.0003,4.673,1.7977,3.6835,1.1605,5.306,6.9077,1.8493,3.4911,1.516,1.0126,1.2028,4.8473,7.0127,3.6524,1.2064,0.891,7.706,7.9751,0.107,1.0476,6.5882,2.8053,2.8971,2.5177,2.3243,6.5053,2.5873,1.3141,2.0856,4.4541,0.5249,0.352,3.2895,2.2301,0.4025,1.1502,0.0003,6.6571,10.5421,0.2488,1.849,0.0002,2.3467,4.4161,1.9971,2.2991,0.0935,2.4311,3.7472,3.7046,1.2851,1.378,4.5531,0.0159,0.9527,6.2057,0.4276,2.4214,2.2345,0.0159,0.0377,2.9493,2.8214,3.4264,5.0733,0.2978,1.8922,1.7999,5.3901,6.5178,1.7178,1.8737,4.2746,2.419,1.5655,2.2556,5.8693,1.9309,0.1874,6.3245,1.1805,2.4195,0.0209,0.6581,0.1014,1.191,5.6729,5.4456,0.5392,0.0002,2.5778,4.3609,4.1489,4.3545,0.105,2.043,1.404,2.8438,3.7874,7.2748,0.7723,1.1349,1.2092,0.0615,2.3902,4.0164,2.2992,6.3532,4.1548,2.5473,2.3001,1.8476,1.2126,0.2697,8.4776,0.0928,1.3309,3.6178,3.3321,1.5136,2.2007,4.4681,5.0326,8.3017,0.9958,4.6498,1.889,3.3891,3.8645,10.7736,0.6169,11.9452,0.5949,4.3709,2.2348,7.5017,4.358,3.6374,6.4511,2.6726,8.8284,2.0957,5.7362,8.5657,0.2966,0.018,1.9004,1.9328,5.0551,4.943,4.169,1.2414,4.6848,1.4162,5.5431,2.0929,0.8211,6.2953,1.0741,1.8028,3.3842,1.082,2.5485,5.3766,5.2588,5.5431,4.9669,4.4088,2.5458,3.8399,2.4565,0.0871,0.2618,3.4346,6.5645,0.4862,2.2038,0.9872,2.2971,0.5184,0.4571,1.672,0.7177,0.0002,1.5754,5.1777,3.0524,3.7146,2.8437,1.1311,1.1969,2.7833,4.0349,2.9274,4.5377,1.0589,5.338,4.3257,3.2187,0.8071,2.7872,5.7038,1.4489,1.3145,0.8999,2.5891,0.0631,2.049,0.9676,0.7208,4.1253,4.0113,1.8158,2.2987,0.0213,1.9632,3.6691,2.0483,0.7767,1.2428,3.3855,1.2093,1.2163,0.8603,0.638,2.8534,0.0395,0.9003,3.9669,6.2262,0.3803,0.607,2.7947]}

{"id":4839,"ended":true,"length":584,"text":"A new camera was recently developed that filters out sea water, effectively allowing the user to view sea life as if it were swimming through air. You were given the honor of taking the camera to the deepest parts of the ocean for the first time.\n\nThe camera is small enough to fit into a bottle, so it can fit anywhere, including a water sports device, and is made of stainless steel. It has a waterproof housing that is only one inch thick. A lens mount on top of the housing can attach to any DSLR or other camera lens.\n\nYou put the camera into the bottle, and set the bottle under the wave, or if the sea is calm, you attach it to a buoy, and then put the buoy under the wave. This allows the camera to use the water pressure to activate its shutter and allow pictures to be taken. The sensor in the camera can be submerged to a depth of up to a meter.\n\nThe water passes through the top of the water-proof housing, and is then carried on the water by the wave and back in through small pores where the housing meets the camera body. The water filters out all the salt from the sea, so the camera is perfectly pure, or at least as good as you would expect to be in the depths of the ocean.\n\nIf you ever went snorkeling or scuba diving, you already know what salt water is like. The main salt comes from the atmosphere. If it didn't, the ocean would be a very different place. To filter salt out of seawater, scientists developed a chemical treatment that replaces ions in the water molecules. But this requires too much energy for the sensor to produce high-quality images, so a new photocell is used. The sensor is in a liquid filled box that is submerged in saltwater. As the saltwater passes through the box, it dries quickly leaving only a vacuum inside. The sensor's photosensitivity is lowered as well as the light passing through. This results in a much more accurate picture.\n\nThe only time the camera is not underwater is when you turn it on. When you push the shutter button, any water is pushed out of the camera body and into a sealed transparent housing. This allows you to capture images without any saltwater.\n\nThis means that while the camera could be used underwater, the results would actually be best and closer to fresh air shots. If you had an underwater case for this camera, it could be used as an underwater camera that could transmit images to an external device. This would allow scientists to get high resolution photos that can be compared in a side-by-side fashion. That is, if the scientists can get the images to be transferred from the camera. In the deep sea, we have very limited data about the sea floor, so it can be very hard to understand how the sea floor is composed.\n\nIf you would like a copy of the camera as an experiment or as a gift for yourself, we suggest that you sign up for our newsletter.","token_len":618,"entropy":[6.4137,8.4193,3.109,4.5198,3.6282,2.7236,7.7883,0.6123,10.029,1.8568,2.2259,6.28,3.7166,2.0473,4.4479,0.0368,3.2757,4.4545,2.164,3.2509,2.7383,0.2702,0.202,5.751,2.2545,5.9903,0.3155,5.8491,7.756,3.793,1.5806,10.144,0.1691,3.6383,2.4701,3.4541,2.0824,1.4221,6.7163,3.4807,0.0011,0.2987,0.9237,3.9165,1.607,0.6005,0.0062,0.736,1.0466,0.0007,1.8591,2.1808,1.7859,5.2089,1.8187,0.5059,0.7854,1.4197,0.7119,6.8508,1.5286,3.0184,1.5684,1.3075,4.5661,4.446,2.4858,2.8969,1.9457,4.7253,5.1267,5.0921,1.7646,2.3997,2.7641,4.4261,0.9721,3.7226,0.0285,0.6363,1.3695,2.2904,0.6808,5.2008,5.2717,1.4306,2.5237,5.4841,4.4762,2.3606,0.3436,1.2201,3.9956,4.8481,4.3343,3.2973,3.0671,1.242,0.4135,5.6162,3.8117,5.9371,0.7149,1.4542,6.0536,0.0088,2.8143,3.0051,0.8693,2.697,1.4124,1.1186,0.0002,3.8809,7.9548,1.0493,0.3023,1.4513,1.2873,3.6108,1.3034,1.0483,6.2301,1.5361,4.9826,6.1411,0.9564,8.4253,2.1396,3.2293,4.3805,2.6459,5.5727,0.7931,4.5956,0.5616,2.2335,6.0427,1.1516,0.248,1.3638,5.7321,2.6294,1.8401,1.8901,3.688,0.9632,6.5026,2.3608,0.315,1.5715,0.9284,2.9587,2.2727,0.9446,0.6425,0.0429,5.3423,1.2489,1.3727,7.1283,1.3517,7.4505,2.0525,3.2612,2.4348,3.3674,9.011,0.1847,0.4587,0.1739,0.8524,2.0029,4.3774,3.3599,0.1573,0.9611,2.469,1.3737,5.7897,2.9509,3.2763,0.1791,0.0398,1.9207,0.0041,3.9438,2.6166,1.0242,0.8182,0.0002,1.1297,4.9545,9.9051,0.2909,0.5975,5.8328,0.3886,0.0421,4.9814,3.9699,1.6742,1.1591,0.9376,0.8657,2.8251,1.8482,5.2625,4.0865,1.159,4.9504,3.6821,1.6246,5.2773,3.2948,2.4856,4.9365,3.6624,7.3039,6.2912,3.8064,1.3427,5.3387,1.716,0.3803,3.2519,3.6662,0.1946,1.3496,2.6956,5.6069,0.785,2.4517,1.5183,4.9193,3.3404,0.0992,1.9117,1.219,3.2762,1.5604,1.3388,1.7586,4.6791,6.3219,3.0657,5.6798,1.3703,0.076,3.1349,3.6786,0.1796,3.3168,1.6443,0.4713,3.6573,2.7866,3.5299,1.6396,4.4999,0.1783,0.5662,0.6645,0.1582,0.4477,0.0002,3.9404,0.4204,5.0809,6.7217,8.4929,0.0178,0.009,0.0468,2.5546,5.1094,0.0135,0.0091,0.6048,0.7819,6.0413,0.7088,2.1395,5.4968,4.4971,1.3753,1.7953,0.5146,2.1051,5.8741,2.0877,5.0052,0.0648,0.7908,6.5317,2.7944,3.6328,2.758,5.7282,0.0007,3.393,1.9687,2.8336,0.3605,1.4288,2.728,3.7706,2.3466,0.127,0.5653,5.4659,4.9571,2.9144,2.261,0.5837,5.0365,0.0059,0.3098,5.2748,3.2702,0.5917,3.974,5.5013,1.0977,6.6436,9.0212,2.6948,0.906,1.4473,6.2825,2.0377,5.1186,2.588,5.826,5.8598,0.1197,2.5321,2.4503,0.8796,5.6029,0.2037,4.2357,5.528,1.0076,0.7266,1.3604,1.7111,1.5623,4.4595,2.9139,7.0959,6.1606,1.7379,2.8487,1.1884,2.0643,3.0487,1.4837,6.0567,1.485,3.744,7.6653,8.3144,2.1809,1.2639,4.6211,0.7306,2.9671,2.8602,0.9362,4.4253,0.8081,0.6327,2.5186,3.0646,0.1169,0.5161,3.294,0.1568,0.8959,6.695,0.3657,5.6624,6.5977,1.9031,1.5799,5.9291,3.2359,0.933,1.5927,2.4606,4.0884,5.6866,6.3121,0.7821,4.9055,3.1938,3.202,3.4454,1.0333,4.5255,6.1252,0.0253,2.765,2.7045,3.7419,0.0068,1.3407,2.9956,1.6468,1.6091,1.854,1.4238,0.3686,0.0002,1.2509,5.4376,4.943,1.6493,1.6105,1.9045,3.007,4.9009,0.2993,0.3461,2.0867,5.9414,1.1861,0.6234,1.0607,2.6667,0.9205,5.9654,0.3627,0.9426,0.9849,0.5654,6.0749,2.4269,3.2914,4.3221,2.1925,0.8571,0.0888,2.1014,3.0474,1.994,1.4789,2.8264,4.2318,10.2129,5.1786,0.8586,1.5618,2.3838,2.4166,0.0393,3.3365,2.6627,2.6227,2.3399,4.6924,4.0525,1.5889,1.1372,0.0002,3.574,4.0829,0.5406,3.9237,1.4365,0.9028,5.3006,1.0018,2.5218,3.3007,0.4972,2.1411,5.8976,1.3574,6.1728,0.2516,5.7346,6.7313,6.7268,0.1478,9.3041,2.8274,9.4532,0.6983,3.2901,0.4343,3.7651,3.8576,1.4988,9.0071,3.8955,4.3414,2.361,0.1685,2.3986,2.25,0.7469,1.3693,2.0348,1.9052,2.1487,2.0018,4.1988,2.5698,8.4135,2.1142,1.2478,3.2422,1.8506,3.3222,1.0373,2.9023,1.2809,1.3561,5.5184,0.1231,3.6846,3.9929,2.4741,2.0183,3.1154,2.3925,0.2293,5.8843,4.1322,3.2403,10.388,0.3193,0.0396,0.0008,0.0002,2.9537,1.0268,5.5142,2.5791,0.7573,1.7412,1.9944,5.4592,2.9574,2.2949,1.815,2.3812,1.7007,0.9145,5.0543,2.8194,1.3348,0.8723,4.5368,4.22,2.1835,7.4332,1.9425,0.1935,4.6682,2.4358,4.1941,2.7399,3.6196,2.4927,1.0024,2.9204,3.8737,1.1809,0.6543,2.1336,3.847,0.9407,2.314,1.7926,0.1029,4.421,1.5361,1.4725,1.3991,2.1704,1.9955,5.5622,0.5485,0.6886,0.0002,3.4905,0.3754,3.6839,0.0889,3.1338,5.0505,0.0368,1.1975,2.8557,4.22,2.2831,4.3475,3.2608,2.4845,0.4123,4.1733,2.0984,2.52,0.1956,3.8566,2.9887,1.8533,0.0453,4.6631,0.3214,0.318,0.5952,1.1753,1.6189]}
{"id":1803,"ended":false,"length":584,"text":"A day at work is like a second weekend, says one of the largest British financial institutions\nCatherine Woods, the head of communications, marketing and corporate services at HSBC, says that while she considers the Monday after an eight-day weekend to be a Monday, those of her colleagues who work in her division often see the day after a working weekend as a Saturday.\n\"I don\u2019t understand why,\" she says. \"But I\u2019m afraid it is simply accepted as such.\"\nWoods also told Business Insider that working from home meant that team members who had to travel for events were often more productive as work could be done as people arrived for the event.\nWoods, who is known for her sense of humor, describes working from home as \"kind of liberating.\"\nShe was among the 2,000 staff members in HSBC's global markets division that was asked last year to begin working from home full time as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\nLast Friday, HSBC announced that all of its 150,000 workers worldwide would now be able to work from home without the need for special approval where possible.\nDespite the difficulties that come with communicating with a remote workforce, she says their productivity has risen.\n\"People take it for granted because it\u2019s been there for so long,\" she said of remote work.\nSpeaking last week, HSBC CEO Noel Quinn said: \"It is too early to speculate on the future of work. We are looking into a new normal. However, it is clear to me that the world has changed and that we will need to continue to adapt to this new world of work for the foreseeable future. We are asking employees to stay connected, and to continue to innovate.\n\"That applies to all our employees \u2013 those who are already working from home and of course those who are based at our sites now will remain in this way. There will be a gradual and safe relaxation over time so that we can bring people back to working at our offices safely.\"\nWoods herself believes that most of her colleagues will not want to return to the office full time once the pandemic is over and that they believe that working home has actually improved their lives.\n\"They have more time to do what they want, see their kids, cook a meal, watch a movie,\" she said. \"That\u2019s very, very important in a pandemic.

{"id":3899,"ended":true,"length":532,"text":"You come across a room, locked from the outside. You hear a man's voice from inside, pleading for you to open it. But painted on the door reads `` Never open ''. What have you done?\n\nYou have created a lockable room. But this is not the lockable room we usually call Lockable.\nIt is in essence a virtual locked room.\n\nVirtual Lockable Rooms (VLRCs) contain the same kind of virtual space we often\nthink of when we hear talk of virtual space.\nSome are huge. Some very small. Some with walls painted on and\nsome with none. But all VLRCs contain two things :\n\n( 1 ) One or more virtual objects that can only be interacted with\nwhen the user is in the room ;\n\n( 2) The possibility to be locked out of the room :\n\na. By the user ;\n\nb. By a third party ;\n\nc. By a combination of both\n\nYou can choose both a virtual object and a lockable door in any VLRC you make.\nThis allows the lockable door to form a complete solution for your project - whether\nyou work for a real company (for instance the manufacturer of\na keypad lock) or purely on your own. The\nobject you will use in your VLRC can be any object that you\nprefer.\n\nThe objects can come in various forms. But they have one thing in common:\n\nthey allow users to use the room for only certain purposes ;\nthey can only be accessed by the user who made them.\nThese users are not the same group that uses the physical\nroom in which the object is contained.\n\nFor instance take the case where\nyou want to have only employees of a certain company\nhave access to some room. Their entrance is a virtual lockable door.\nThis can be achieved either by requiring the employee's\nidentification or by asking the employee for the\nkey to the lock.\n\nThis way only the employees of that company will have access to the\nroom. The other users of the room (the one's who will\nuse the virtual door as entrance) will not have access\nto the rooms contents.\n\nA company would also have access to the room, since they will\ndecide on it's content. It is they who will decide if\nthe room will contain only a picture of the company's\nlogo or if they want a virtual safe there too. This\ndecision can be made on the basis of whatever your users\nfind important.\nYou can even have several companies making Virtual Lockables.\nThey will share the objects and the rooms with each other.\n\nYou can choose to have the lockable door in more\nthan one room. For example you allow the user to make a virtual keypad lock in\nwhatever room he prefers. Then this lock can be used in\nseveral rooms.

'' and they tell you.`` I write on the piano..you know...on the piano so I can see what I am writing about.the music makes my brain work faster and I can write much faster...then when I am done I can have a song on tape.and the next day someone sings it and a movie is made from the song and then it goes to the top of the charts..so.... what do you do?'' and I say `` Man, look I can write a better song than you and also I will keep up with the hits of tomorrow ''. but he looks at me and says `` Dude, who is to say your song wasn't a hit today?...and then he laughs a lot and we both go to a movie...but the music always plays in our heads... and maybe in the song the words that we will write can be sung by our favorite singer...or maybe not..maybe the words we chose will just fit us perfectly with the tune... or maybe... or maybe not..just like the notes and the beats in the music and the words the singer chooses.... and maybe one day we will write that song. the one that will become a hit in the world...a world that has forgotten that we ever came down from the mountain..a world that will sing one more song.... and when...and when they will..they will remember...all those little pieces that came together to make that great song which is now forgotten on the mountain...they will remember..and a new beginning can start....and maybe one day in the future our song will come back to the world...and you will hear this song sung by someone else and then you will say to yourself..well...that's what it takes to write a hit...a song can never be a hit without you knowing the music that goes with the words...so...how are you going to write it? how are you going to be the best in any activity? is there someone who can teach you that? in the movie it is clear that they have a teacher...so it seems that it can't be that complicated...it will be hard work but it will be worth it and you will enjoy the work and you will become the best at it.....well...and you will become the best at a lot of things...you will become a better person....and not only that... you will be able to write in a way that can be seen so you will become a star....that is what it takes for

{"id":414,"ended":true,"length":573,"text":"You wake up one morning to find that you have written a disturbing note to yourself, and you don't remember how, when, or why.\n\nThe note says, \"You have written a disturbed note to yourself -- \"\n\nYou discover that the note, while disturbing, has no obvious link to your state of mind.\n\nIn spite of this, you don't give up trying to remember the details.\n\nEven though the notes says \"You have written a disturbed note to yourself\", you are very sure that you haven't written a disturbed note to yourself.\n\nAfter searching through your possessions, you find a journal. You had written a disturbing note to yourself about that time, and you have not only read but read the whole book.\n\nThis is what the note looks like on the face of it.\n\n\"You have written a disturbed note to yourself -- you have read the whole book\"\n\nA little thinking -- and it dawns on you where that journal may have gone.\n\nA further thought shows you that you have not only read the book, you have also written in it.\n\nBut that brings us to another question.\n\nHow can you be sure that the rest of the note you wrote is not the one that says \"You have written a disturbed note to yourself -- you have written a disturbed note to yourself -- you have written a disturbed note to yourself -- you have written a disturbed note to yourself -- you have written a disturbed note to yourself -- you have written a disturbed note to yourself\"\n\nYou haven't written that note, but you are not 100% sure that you haven't.\n\nSo which one is the disturbed note to yourself, and which is the disturbed note you have written?\n\nWell, this isn't so surprising when you remember that the word \"You\" is in the first one, and not in the second, but the word \"You\" is actually in both of the notes.\n\nWhat you must understand is that they are both true.\n\nThe more you think, the more you must be thinking in the same direction which may be why you are not sure at all where it is to you, and where it could be.\n\nSo it would actually be best to not think at all, just sit and notice what it is.\n\nYour attention to what it is, can bring that to you, without any thought at all.\n\nThen you should look at the disturbing part of it in a more natural way.\n\nYou see, that your writing that note, really says nothing, because your writing is itself disturbed.\n\nIt may be that you are trying to put your mind to some end, or trying to understand a particular thing, but you are really just distracting yourself.\n\nSo your disturbed note to yourself means nothing, really.\n\nAll it needs now is your attention to bring it to you, even without any writing at all.\n\nThe best way to achieve that, is to not write anything.","token_len":621,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,3.7691,0.6601,3.3403,1.2604,1.3586,1.8863,1.6066,6.678,1.4506,9.1247,3.2777,1.6799,3.2315,2.3229,1.4282,1.5915,3.1264,0.0011,4.0151,3.1156,4.9719,4.5877,0.6879,0.6025,1.0358,0.7802,1.8846,0.0014,3.0196,3.2822,2.9857,1.3251,0.1533,2.8854,2.5017,2.4501,1.4268,6.7861,0.4376,0.3556,0.387,8.9295,4.8166,0.5518,0.0002,2.335,7.0828,0.6163,2.0787,0.3259,4.4805,4.1181,3.3267,0.3404,3.0296,1.4733,4.4,5.0259,0.2192,1.384,7.1725,0.1302,0.1999,0.4963,1.3083,0.0001,3.6662,6.0097,0.0021,1.3782,0.4713,0.8077,3.6067,0.0012,6.4254,0.6356,4.2273,0.2857,3.2287,1.779,5.0039,1.8072,1.3039,0.0001,4.9638,1.7039,2.222,2.8296,9.4379,1.8534,2.2907,0.9636,0.2029,0.2891,1.2178,0.0689,0.1202,0.0163,4.9824,1.0133,3.2471,6.4095,3.9831,0.4302,1.068,3.4907,0.0006,1.9797,1.7795,3.3205,0.062,0.2705,0.406,0.7273,0.323,0.0002,4.878,6.9182,2.1431,1.2784,6.9591,0.8687,0.6934,1.0777,2.0423,5.1009,2.2705,2.4779,6.7361,2.0258,1.4132,2.6172,0.039,0.3289,0.0586,3.3248,4.1882,5.0842,1.8342,1.1125,1.28,3.0843,2.4233,5.6849,3.6549,5.6223,3.3367,2.297,4.356,4.67,0.6626,0.3294,0.0002,2.8253,1.6436,2.8485,2.816,2.8384,4.4419,0.0016,3.4745,1.0541,5.083,0.0908,3.9254,0.8618,0.4345,0.0001,4.2912,1.5557,0.9565,0.2153,0.1478,1.1331,0.005,0.0605,0.0122,2.3336,4.4478,1.334,1.8667,1.4952,0.4514,0.1165,4.7473,0.3163,0.0002,4.7786,5.167,7.119,6.1466,2.5303,3.6952,6.5434,0.1012,0.0827,0.0147,7.082,3.7015,4.113,3.9056,1.2324,2.8087,0.4961,0.2004,0.0001,4.0476,7.5069,2.4639,5.7894,2.5349,1.4144,1.3743,1.4181,2.543,1.5043,1.2756,0.8527,2.3163,0.9296,2.3038,0.4907,1.5983,3.1084,5.1891,1.406,0.9311,0.1097,0.0001,4.2019,3.1629,5.3101,0.8759,0.3792,3.2263,2.8924,0.7872,0.3038,0.0001,2.7025,1.7849,0.4926,3.2977,0.2621,0.3441,1.7139,6.8138,0.0201,1.01,3.3798,2.031,2.4582,2.2763,1.3355,2.5276,2.3767,1.5225,5.0124,0.9314,1.2881,0.1709,0.1147,0.1352,0.2057,0.0123,0.0483,0.0142,5.295,0.748,0.3544,4.1179,1.4846,0.3481,0.0091,0.0422,0.0312,3.3591,1.1882,0.4368,0.5352,0.1719,0.1234,0.0077,0.04,0.0254,1.8243,0.5877,0.2146,0.1048,0.048,0.0686,0.0086,0.021,0.0209,0.5752,0.3061,0.0791,0.0479,0.0273,0.0371,0.0057,0.0024,0.0192,0.1794,0.1419,0.0479,0.0361,0.0133,0.0378,0.005,0.0019,0.0152,6.03,0.9311,0.0001,2.6198,4.976,0.0009,2.1136,3.1302,0.9031,2.0512,1.5395,0.5514,2.6476,3.8661,5.1762,0.2243,0.25,1.0995,1.6197,3.2673,0.0006,3.1776,0.2412,0.0001,3.0182,6.4122,2.6687,1.2723,1.6967,4.6828,0.9435,1.8504,0.4908,2.6447,1.069,0.5379,2.1708,0.2477,0.5163,0.0559,4.7632,1.9083,0.3533,0.9053,0.102,0.0001,3.3673,0.1691,3.9307,4.1102,0.0006,4.3694,4.6745,3.2779,0.3831,4.2654,0.6548,1.5249,6.3044,0.385,5.4869,0.3079,1.2623,2.1739,0.932,2.6192,6.6411,1.6556,0.977,3.932,0.9289,0.0919,0.7166,3.7223,2.0613,2.8964,2.8523,0.2229,1.4305,0.5159,0.817,4.1393,0.6496,4.3877,1.6047,1.4278,3.6308,0.4662,0.0595,0.0001,3.9367,2.1925,5.5448,4.1561,0.4061,0.0969,5.456,0.8352,1.6937,6.7588,0.7667,0.2009,0.0002,2.0016,4.9452,0.6627,2.1783,2.5309,0.0599,0.2152,0.8717,4.47,3.721,4.7293,3.9735,1.6684,1.829,1.9736,7.2522,5.9656,1.9096,4.7909,0.933,2.0073,2.8088,1.661,4.6358,0.7479,4.2434,2.8659,1.2587,5.0424,3.4549,2.8455,1.1796,3.0526,0.2741,4.3996,0.8539,1.9648,0.0433,0.0002,2.6354,3.5348,4.7253,6.6071,0.3793,4.0474,0.8098,3.3202,1.1917,2.5824,0.006,2.0278,4.1754,6.5802,2.7383,7.6457,2.0467,3.0126,0.5027,1.886,0.1519,0.0002,4.7832,4.7046,3.6004,2.9816,2.0202,0.1554,2.2041,5.7512,5.0218,6.1805,3.335,1.5831,1.8792,5.4324,2.8638,4.3253,1.7876,0.0057,0.4109,0.0896,0.0002,5.4012,1.1554,3.5364,4.0554,1.0915,1.2679,7.635,5.0834,0.3077,1.8324,4.1834,1.9571,1.8618,3.7561,0.4109,0.6175,0.0951,0.0001,2.0713,4.1633,1.6155,3.8306,6.2594,7.5116,6.6642,8.7864,3.695,6.7479,5.0018,4.1687,2.7077,3.7205,3.5605,2.5768,1.2389,7.485,4.4369,0.5403,0.0763,0.0001,2.3217,3.8056,1.0648,1.5002,1.3933,1.4952,3.5368,0.0549,4.8651,2.3772,0.9605,1.3189,4.0699,6.7585,0.7528,1.5406,4.1499,0.0346,5.3256,3.8481,3.9929,2.1215,0.8809,1.6812,1.6172,0.9672,3.5101,1.7795,8.5588,0.2307,1.6737,0.0468,0.0001,2.5872,4.0209,10.4198,1.1784,2.8591,0.093,5.3883,1.9055,1.6101,6.0059,0.4881,0.1534,0.0001,5.5219,2.2186,5.5523,5.0284,0.1615,3.5838,0.6659,0.5961,6.5229,1.878,0.5406,2.3096,1.1283,4.8931,5.1758,1.3313,9.4115,0.9071,0.0059,0.2625,0.0643,0.0002,3.0609,5.2051,0.7086,0.205,4.8103,1.7977,2.4349,0.5509,0.358,4.2895,2.4281,2.5573,1.685]}
{"id":3658,"ended":true,"length":552,"text":"Every night a fairy godmother appears, granting you a magical princess dress and turning various appliances and pets into a horse drawn carriage ready to whisk you away to the Prince's ball.\n\nThe fairy godmother then magically appears at 11pm, so that you can get up the next morning and get your fairy tale wish of finding a partner in time to go to the wedding.\n\nA fairy godmother (or godfather ) is a character in children's folklore often appearing in tales and poems. A fairy godmother is generally portrayed as a benevolent powerful female figure who grants wishes, but also may help mortals in need of help. Sometimes they appear as elderly female creatures who only grant wishes in extreme cases, but may use their power to improve the circumstances of mortals.\n\nThe most famous story of fairies is \"The Princess and The Pea\" by Hans Christian Andersen, which tells of the magical fairytale world in which we live, where there are many sorts of fairies and gnomes and magic can be both benevolent and malevolent, all working together in a realm full of enchantment and mystery that sometimes seems to go on forever.\n\nHow does A Fairy Godmother grant a wish to a princess?\n\nShe appears, grants her wish and takes off again; leaving you to enjoy the rest of your wish.\n\nHow does A Fairy Godmother make a horse into a horse-drawn carriage?\n\nShe appears, grants her wish and takes off again; leaving you to enjoy the rest of your wish.\n\nHow does A Fairy Godmother make a horse turn into a horse-drawn carriage?\n\nShe appears, grants her wish and takes off again; leaving you to enjoy the rest of your wish.\n\nHow does A Fairy Godmother turn my father horse into a prince?\n\nShe appears, grants her wish and takes off again; leaving you to enjoy the rest of your wish.\n\nCan I marry my father horse?\n\nNo, but you can call him daddy.\n\nIs a Fairy Godmother real?\n\nYes. In fact there is an Elf and Fairy Godmother fairy godmother who grant wishes everyday to children on behalf of Merlin, king of wizards.\n\nWill she grant me a wish if I go to the supermarket in my fairy costume and carry an umbrella?\n\nUnfortunately not. But it's a great way of saving money at the checkout, and a fairy godmother costume is an easy way to raise the money to pay for it.\n\nWhen can I expect a fairy godmother?\n\nYou will receive a phone call on your 11th birthday announcing her arrival and you will receive a letter the night before your wish is fulfilled detailing the wishes of others that have already been granted.\n\nHow do I look for a fairy godmother?\n\nMost fairies will tell you they live with a godmother or a daddy. They may suggest that you visit this world in which they live.

{"id":4971,"ended":true,"length":552,"text":"Every night a fairy godmother appears, granting you a magical princess dress and turning various appliances and pets into a horse drawn carriage ready to whisk you away to the Prince's ball.\n\nThe fairy godmother then magically appears at 11pm, so that you can get up the next morning and get your fairy tale wish of finding a partner in time to go to the wedding.\n\nA fairy godmother (or godfather ) is a character in children's folklore often appearing in tales and poems. A fairy godmother is generally portrayed as a benevolent powerful female figure who grants wishes, but also may help mortals in need of help. Sometimes they appear as elderly female creatures who only grant wishes in extreme cases, but may use their power to improve the circumstances of mortals.\n\nThe most famous story of fairies is \"The Princess and The Pea\" by Hans Christian Andersen, which tells of the magical fairytale world in which we live, where there are many sorts of fairies and gnomes and magic can be both benevolent and malevolent, all working together in a realm full of enchantment and mystery that sometimes seems to go on forever.\n\nHow does A Fairy Godmother grant a wish to a princess?\n\nShe appears, grants her wish and takes off again; leaving you to enjoy the rest of your wish.\n\nHow does A Fairy Godmother make a horse into a horse-drawn carriage?\n\nShe appears, grants her wish and takes off again; leaving you to enjoy the rest of your wish.\n\nHow does A Fairy Godmother make a horse turn into a horse-drawn carriage?\n\nShe appears, grants her wish and takes off again; leaving you to enjoy the rest of your wish.\n\nHow does A Fairy Godmother turn my father horse into a prince?\n\nShe appears, grants her wish and takes off again; leaving you to enjoy the rest of your wish.\n\nCan I marry my father horse?\n\nNo, but you can call him daddy.\n\nIs a Fairy Godmother real?\n\nYes. In fact there is an Elf and Fairy Godmother fairy godmother who grant wishes everyday to children on behalf of Merlin, king of wizards.\n\nWill she grant me a wish if I go to the supermarket in my fairy costume and carry an umbrella?\n\nUnfortunately not. But it's a great way of saving money at the checkout, and a fairy godmother costume is an easy way to raise the money to pay for it.\n\nWhen can I expect a fairy godmother?\n\nYou will receive a phone call on your 11th birthday announcing her arrival and you will receive a letter the night before your wish is fulfilled detailing the wishes of others that have already been granted.\n\nHow do I look for a fairy godmother?\n\nMost fairies will tell you they live with a godmother or a daddy.

{"id":4717,"ended":true,"length":596,"text":"In the United States, the death penalty has never actually existed. Death row is an elaborate conspiracy in which the `` killed '' prisoners are sent to a government facility for experiments.\n\nThe government has been able to maintain this operation by a combination of bribery (\"We will supply you with chemicals, equipment, personnel, and everything else you ask for\") and blackmail (. ``You'll never be executed now, won't you? We'll never tell the truth about you if you tell us everything we want to know. Tell us, and everything will be fine for you... and for your family... and for the poor, poor souls who have to kill you!'').\n\nFor the U.S. government, this is a good arrangement; in fact it's a great one. They don't have to pay for the drugs; nor has there always been a need to provide them with blood transfusions during the procedure.\n\nFurthermore, the prisoners are not really in the '' death-row '' in most areas. They are sent there by the prison system -- in other words, because there is no place else for them to go. As for what has caused their original conviction for death penalty and execution, well, that depends on how the prisoner was convicted. There is a whole host of different ways in which a\nprisoner can be wrongfully '' sentenced (i.e. `` convicted''); it all depends on the court at which you `` go '' (i.e. plead your case).. and it all depends on the way in which you are `` found guilty'', which can be completely at the whim and fancy of the prosecutor (or the judge).\n\nThere are certainly many cases of innocent people who actually were executed and of people who were guilty who were `` let out of prison'' too soon.\n\nAlso, some cases are just blatantly insane -- e.g. the case of the prisoner Timothy McVeigh, who was executed in 2001... of course, everyone knows the real story of what actually happened (the real story that the federal prison system wanted to cover up).\n\nWhen something goes horribly wrong in the United States, it usually means that the entire legal system has been manipulated by the Federal government through the local sheriff or any other official in charge. It's like '' Big Brother '' has taken control over the entire country.\n\nAs with Russia, there has been a lot of corruption that has occurred in the past years which has allowed the state to maintain itself and its system. Furthermore, it's a well-known fact that the legal system is heavily influenced by money; thus it is highly likely that even people who are supposed to be innocent -- or who have absolutely no connection with the government -- end up being placed on the death row.\n\nIn fact, there has been plenty of people who have been exonerated of all charges in every case that has ever occurred in America due to an error made during the trial or due to corruption and political maneuvering. But, of course, these people have absolutely no money to sue the government.","token_len":626,"entropy":[2.6222,4.9428,0.0679,0.2762,1.9547,6.1081,1.3503,1.6708,3.7304,5.3519,5.1887,1.1219,6.7742,2.5882,2.8012,3.4248,6.3673,5.0836,4.1457,0.351,1.2562,15.0216,14.331,3.5193,5.8268,0.766,3.9361,0.3175,3.1179,5.9337,2.3654,2.689,8.7715,1.8259,3.2492,0.0062,1.7907,3.6595,2.5217,2.8006,3.6492,0.0326,4.99,2.9608,5.6862,3.371,5.0994,3.2152,0.002,4.5024,10.3635,5.8291,3.7962,6.3334,0.6819,0.2846,5.8704,2.2387,5.6249,0.425,6.3203,0.4784,0.9649,6.3294,1.3123,0.9251,5.4243,0.6061,1.1849,0.0719,4.9834,9.1071,6.8303,3.5514,3.2453,2.8325,1.4974,4.2984,8.0057,1.4351,6.0448,0.011,0.0321,2.6164,4.3037,1.3127,3.594,4.9885,2.8036,0.7959,1.9464,1.7427,5.0813,0.3738,2.6677,0.7109,6.649,1.3721,0.916,0.7273,0.0909,3.501,6.2845,0.3022,3.4489,1.9631,7.1493,2.1535,0.5409,3.771,4.3682,0.552,5.322,4.0436,3.5629,2.399,0.9155,3.7602,1.3927,0.6779,1.4216,6.0225,2.4371,4.3296,5.448,1.8678,2.0661,2.7313,6.1357,1.6198,5.8515,0.3554,1.0649,1.063,0.0004,4.7839,1.8486,4.5334,0.0024,0.0173,0.7087,0.8693,0.5549,2.2366,1.3782,1.3335,5.3436,7.614,3.9705,3.9257,1.3976,2.742,2.0811,1.8691,3.3957,1.5095,0.4208,4.4688,3.6831,0.0007,1.8004,0.3109,1.9302,1.56,1.5515,3.313,3.176,7.7066,5.3955,2.1261,6.8713,0.0077,1.0484,1.8516,1.3636,4.5159,1.2305,2.0283,7.8381,3.4839,0.0177,6.4304,0.9792,6.0487,0.3832,1.9905,0.0002,6.577,0.0489,1.2569,4.9601,1.0652,2.4917,5.7246,3.6344,1.768,5.7074,5.8787,3.1449,0.7309,0.8178,4.1736,4.4984,5.7824,1.5651,1.6316,0.6913,3.8395,2.8191,2.3328,1.0788,4.7781,2.6869,5.9135,3.5542,2.2988,0.0046,0.2697,5.584,3.6266,0.9524,1.0684,3.6983,3.912,0.7912,0.1347,1.3556,0.6609,0.8168,4.4579,2.7847,4.5116,5.0485,5.7777,2.2939,8.7307,6.0936,2.3238,5.793,4.0562,4.4579,4.218,0.4608,4.8516,0.156,2.5226,4.3717,0.397,2.2345,2.2468,3.9555,2.7607,2.8537,0.5887,4.1102,1.2604,2.3229,5.0538,3.5257,0.0046,3.5536,3.9516,1.7042,0.0034,2.6285,9.43,26.0946,0.4139,1.946,0.7859,6.2294,0.1078,9.2807,3.1309,5.5921,3.8978,0.0027,0.0023,2.9553,5.7863,4.4829,4.2231,4.2267,3.5059,4.6091,0.3368,0.1542,1.1225,5.1645,5.9947,2.675,4.5862,9.8762,6.1397,2.3342,1.4739,1.1593,0.0008,0.0024,0.2184,11.1921,5.0775,0.3536,3.711,8.9762,3.2936,3.3572,0.9377,0.1884,0.0936,0.8581,4.0614,1.5696,0.0023,0.8976,1.8169,4.3045,5.6806,2.2027,5.5405,2.1066,2.4284,3.7199,1.0949,7.3606,6.1209,2.2812,2.3737,5.0566,9.8649,0.0094,0.3628,4.6521,3.0904,1.9785,1.7576,1.6,1.568,0.6108,0.0003,3.3968,0.8024,4.5618,2.5039,3.1749,2.3203,4.1022,0.7997,2.1474,6.1689,3.0059,2.2217,2.9131,6.5588,2.5238,0.4336,0.9569,5.7367,5.8429,0.969,6.0576,8.1378,2.0133,1.824,1.3733,1.8802,7.7461,2.8296,1.0824,2.0889,0.0003,6.1112,0.2964,3.8137,3.6189,1.8177,3.8939,8.0314,5.3159,3.4015,4.7817,0.0027,0.001,0.9227,2.0063,2.6183,0.1327,2.4053,3.948,7.5875,2.9097,0.0213,0.0003,1.2686,0.5125,0.5259,2.339,1.26,4.5468,6.6718,5.7326,2.5451,0.731,6.1773,1.3307,2.7182,4.7179,2.3331,1.5768,3.1933,4.1764,0.1673,4.1788,3.1872,3.9643,1.0365,4.4317,2.5159,4.8301,4.2343,0.4819,4.4307,0.6781,2.8553,0.0832,1.2306,0.7016,0.0003,5.5293,6.6895,2.2418,2.621,0.0506,1.7058,1.208,1.2852,0.002,0.2547,1.5372,3.1185,3.6882,1.0603,1.2477,4.6192,4.7168,0.1071,1.8611,0.9145,4.979,2.2167,0.6878,4.5118,0.9883,5.1218,1.195,8.5458,5.3937,2.3021,6.2611,0.4632,3.7975,2.75,1.1905,1.4023,3.2803,1.5334,3.7901,6.1339,8.209,1.3198,3.4859,5.1008,3.8817,3.1024,2.297,0.956,1.7507,3.8797,1.1212,0.7832,0.0003,4.1486,4.2067,8.4705,0.4434,2.1685,3.1585,0.6953,0.7783,2.0167,0.0468,3.4942,5.0739,0.8993,2.3086,0.7122,0.5623,3.3056,5.2304,5.7763,1.0545,4.0758,0.7964,4.6283,0.4944,4.0589,6.6239,3.168,1.594,5.7877,2.5489,6.7886,0.0328,2.6361,1.2783,2.6491,5.8079,0.4878,1.0867,0.0532,0.0934,1.1728,6.6417,0.0504,1.3802,4.9101,1.5532,0.0605,4.3947,4.6643,4.9415,2.9699,1.5099,4.0058,0.9855,0.0506,5.2495,4.2627,0.4391,1.1481,5.6112,0.0086,0.3117,2.9304,5.0973,3.1707,1.9113,1.8626,4.8644,0.2663,3.6299,1.5633,0.7327,2.1002,0.3641,5.0087,0.0009,1.531,5.5755,2.4408,1.9692,1.9286,0.6953,0.793,0.3454,0.0003,2.6274,2.1349,0.0593,2.3618,2.5105,0.2913,5.2507,0.0255,5.1339,1.2263,0.8865,0.5468,4.3972,0.0002,1.8911,2.677,0.5705,3.0298,5.1151,1.9116,2.9048,0.9929,0.9186,2.9393,1.5043,2.8777,7.1689,0.0267,4.7207,3.9756,3.4226,3.8439,0.3629,2.6007,2.5884,5.0332,0.0528,4.4416,3.9869,5.4711,2.7221,0.0592,0.7276,4.4113,2.8241,2.4995,0.0271,0.0695,3.5495,0.6945,2.0764,5.759,0.2171,6.2601,1.3707,7.8614,0.9752,0.8894,2.074]}
{"id":657,"ended":true,"length":590,"text":"The last time the aliens invaded our planet they fled after losing the war. They have reluctantly returned to wage war and are relieved to see that dinosaurs no longer inhabit Earth, but have been replaced by the smaller and less intimidating humans.\n\nThe aliens are determined to destroy humanity. Fortunately our heroes are determined to resist, so the aliens have brought an army of killer robots, as well as a time machine, so they can win the war by winning it at different periods in time.\n\nThis is the story of a mission to destroy humanity, a race against time, and the power of one man.\n\nThe game has three unique time and space war rooms, each with its own rules, and three separate missions.\n\nEach mission has a special scenario, but the basic goal is the defeat of humanity.\n\nThe game is very ambitious to its goal, making use of three different time and space mechanics :\n\n1- The time machine allows the player to go to a time far in the past or in the future ( and possibly to the moon or Mars! )\n\n2- The time machine allows the player to travel back in time to a specific moment in history.\n\n3- The time machine allows the player to leave to a time far in the future ( the future being as far as one year in the future).\n\nThe game is played over a series of battles. During each combat the player uses dice rolls to move his spaceship around the map. He can also jump to space (but this requires one extra move ).\n\nTo move his spaceship into combat, the player must spend a force token. Since the number needed to combat one attack is equal or less, then a player can be lucky or careful.\n\nIf the player spends a force token, then the ship takes the roll of the random dice. On each die roll he can move, change his target, or attack the target. These actions are all in the same round, and not cumulative like the other dice rolls ( movement, attack of opportunity, etc...).\n\nThis makes a difference in how the game plays, and gives you different strategies to choose from.\n\nWhen the pilot has no more force tokens, which are used on three turns before leaving combat, then he is taken out of play and the game goes to the next round.\n\nForces tokens are required every three rounds. If a player has no forces tokens, then he can only attack and dodge ( and a pilot can only do either one or the other).\n\nIf he has both a dodge and a force token in a same round, then it's game over.\n\nThere are some other rules as well, but this is how the basic game plays.\n\nThe game provides plenty of rules ( with a lot of explanations... very well done! ) and it can be played solo, by two players against each other, or by three or four players online simultaneously.\n\nThis is a very ambitious game with an extremely complicated and very good looking interface and it is well worth your time.","token_len":626,"entropy":[5.9486,1.5563,2.641,9.5994,4.0277,3.4816,0.9399,3.4069,6.7496,3.839,5.6777,1.9273,3.5047,1.9643,2.1189,3.3735,11.5197,2.8462,1.0593,10.041,0.434,4.1004,2.2457,10.1312,1.2426,1.5118,1.2214,9.5371,4.9643,0.0036,4.2523,2.3425,2.7148,1.5566,2.9287,2.1682,3.1065,0.2088,2.8679,6.1426,3.1668,2.0189,5.9022,6.523,0.71,1.6662,0.0751,2.0581,2.2414,1.769,5.0568,0.0768,1.9372,2.4185,2.1067,6.2896,6.0956,3.9212,1.1707,5.0698,0.227,5.8945,2.444,2.8039,2.6763,2.268,2.826,4.7756,3.4417,1.1371,0.4013,8.5348,0.7139,2.4949,4.878,0.1182,0.0073,1.3987,7.755,1.493,1.7489,4.5411,1.3778,0.1839,7.6782,0.9485,0.5085,4.3765,6.7317,5.2014,4.7497,7.8355,5.1153,2.4503,1.2983,0.2526,1.1096,0.0003,3.7195,1.7479,1.496,2.4698,0.1403,1.7125,6.3214,1.3968,2.0342,2.7101,1.9045,2.8423,5.0527,5.305,0.1442,1.761,1.3391,2.0487,5.4352,0.2787,4.8215,2.2756,1.3621,1.0761,0.0003,2.435,3.7642,3.054,3.7861,5.3757,7.0846,4.257,1.0423,7.643,6.8667,1.2578,1.3356,0.6935,1.8806,0.0067,4.2301,2.1292,1.7454,3.8438,3.9662,3.8754,0.9754,1.4937,0.0002,3.1328,1.2416,1.253,1.3796,4.2683,5.6687,1.6473,4.3374,1.8722,5.1573,4.515,0.3662,2.8291,8.2104,0.0531,3.4699,0.8075,1.5208,0.0002,1.6373,2.5276,1.7089,3.7655,6.6046,4.6968,4.9615,5.0396,0.7727,5.8098,3.2022,0.0058,4.9253,0.9744,2.3685,1.2327,0.0194,5.0366,9.1954,0.798,0.0002,3.305,4.2126,3.213,2.7883,3.1251,5.2,1.5693,0.8937,0.0441,4.5314,2.1168,1.9509,1.8059,5.9708,3.0511,0.7791,1.0964,3.0316,4.9986,0.4403,0.1142,3.6983,8.4909,5.3707,3.3237,1.9909,4.1657,1.8558,2.6777,6.7156,0.5332,0.3234,0.0005,1.5594,0.0155,0.3723,0.9686,0.2894,0.6235,0.1617,0.0298,0.0113,2.9563,2.2544,0.328,0.003,1.231,1.8772,3.3232,3.5067,0.8319,1.9293,2.2662,0.6411,0.0003,0.1807,0.0926,0.2728,0.9686,0.0849,0.4196,0.1738,0.0407,0.018,5.973,5.9558,2.9674,1.8995,0.3278,0.4036,0.0625,0.5142,1.2942,4.8854,2.8949,5.2745,5.9416,1.6368,0.5857,5.0313,3.117,2.0772,0.5644,0.9597,3.4845,0.1424,0.0003,1.4385,1.2042,1.482,4.1742,4.3139,1.4762,3.9015,0.0044,6.0882,2.0482,4.447,0.9099,4.9874,1.8623,0.6301,5.3983,7.5343,3.433,0.6844,3.6634,3.4006,5.2907,2.0499,1.0633,3.497,1.0079,3.6966,1.5978,1.7648,5.0784,2.3289,5.1939,3.5556,5.1533,3.2083,2.8016,5.1079,3.7229,1.9044,4.9539,0.7789,0.0004,4.5477,4.5074,3.1748,0.1541,5.2271,6.8787,0.7875,0.6918,0.1748,0.6285,4.8966,1.4661,6.3903,4.1863,1.8198,6.3045,1.2344,4.3623,8.1953,0.6492,7.9966,4.4558,4.219,0.954,2.6051,6.8929,1.9871,2.7349,5.0206,2.8003,3.9832,1.0013,5.9408,9.7839,3.1286,8.1946,0.885,0.8506,0.0003,3.5643,0.8634,0.8632,3.3538,0.8916,0.0512,0.0232,0.819,1.5365,1.05,1.879,4.3274,2.6038,6.7497,3.0813,0.7103,8.764,1.6876,1.8884,5.2766,2.6696,4.3872,2.9871,4.2375,1.709,2.4045,3.6243,4.2604,2.139,5.0038,0.8025,0.9122,2.6923,2.7421,2.3839,0.7262,5.3791,1.2963,1.1848,4.1574,4.6309,1.3997,2.1445,3.858,1.4525,1.4111,5.3834,5.8285,6.1494,1.8497,2.524,1.9968,1.7173,3.5696,9.1768,1.4269,1.8687,7.4148,4.9645,0.3403,0.9918,5.1951,1.1995,0.5398,0.0004,3.6605,3.8956,3.8548,6.2147,1.0937,1.8613,1.5396,1.408,1.1596,2.0181,1.843,4.3718,2.0998,4.482,3.3489,1.4409,2.9847,0.1397,0.6012,0.7564,0.0003,4.096,1.4684,6.1251,3.8322,4.3678,4.2908,1.4196,0.1039,1.0909,6.5926,1.6941,2.3095,4.3278,6.91,4.7498,3.8056,6.3559,1.3753,0.2447,2.3863,1.1301,2.8179,5.3461,2.0907,0.6565,4.7606,2.3203,2.2012,1.2525,3.1907,1.6238,1.6119,1.2534,0.4332,0.4679,0.6204,0.0003,4.4191,6.4739,1.6591,0.7393,4.9963,5.1432,4.2503,1.471,1.382,2.8242,1.8871,0.9579,2.1128,1.8467,3.4462,0.8918,0.8158,0.9186,0.9255,2.3237,1.9363,1.8791,2.8708,6.1926,3.4901,3.6213,5.4567,5.8001,1.3414,1.3519,3.7705,6.0994,2.2125,4.1014,2.2753,0.1191,1.443,0.5437,0.0003,2.4704,3.0066,0.7481,5.5131,3.7253,12.2065,0.4042,0.7544,1.3531,0.0633,3.5825,4.201,6.3412,0.6089,0.2362,0.4375,3.6795,2.0012,5.7006,0.0102,0.5581,0.493,0.0003,3.83,0.4488,4.3039,3.8497,1.8871,4.4255,0.0166,0.9197,1.3741,3.0522,0.638,4.6004,0.9195,6.4794,1.475,1.7771,0.9748,0.2296,0.0002,1.7352,1.4573,6.7431,6.4098,0.0211,3.3928,4.8898,5.7158,2.2229,2.5912,0.2161,6.3674,7.1032,8.4046,3.291,2.6867,3.0473,0.4919,1.6463,4.0951,3.7736,0.3959,0.7589,4.7467,2.2187,4.6061,3.1662,0.8039,6.9714,1.3625,0.0132,1.4732,0.4922,1.5662,3.8471,2.4796,1.1341,0.6866,7.4157,7.0195,0.3046,0.3573,0.0003,3.4716,1.0044,1.4213,1.3691,5.7177,0.7165,3.6701,3.5879,3.2658,4.817,2.7374,3.5954,5.2126,5.4341,4.2462,3.51,2.9484,1.5062,4.4414,0.4423,2.4492,0.1218,0.9481]}
{"id":4949,"ended":true,"length":562,"text":"It is 1939, and World War II has just begun. This time, America enters the war immediately... both countries, that is - The United States and the Confederate States of America, which won the Civil War in 1864.\n\nThe United States is one of the four largest powers in the World. The CSA, on the other hand, is much smaller, but they have a large army... so they start their war of independence earlier, and they win more.\n\nOne day, the US General Patton, the American Hero, will appear in the White House, and will try to convince our President into sending support to help the US soldiers. But, of course, President Roosevelt won't do it - he only agrees to increase support by the French and British.\n\nSo, in the game. Once you start as the CSA, you have to defeat the USA in at least one turn (by any means ), and you have to win the war.\n\nYou also have to send at least 8 army units (2 infantry brigades are required, and 4 cavalry ) into action in every fight in order to get a victory point, which will be the victory condition.\n\nYour army consists of only 3 brigades (2 infantry brigades and 1 artillery brigade ), the other 3 have been allocated to the production of your army items.\n\nIf you wish to use the same army as in the original game, just change the names. You don't need to use another theme.\n\nThe game consists of 4 turns per side of the war, and it's just like in the original game. But now, it's just like the scenario that begins at the beginning of the scenario of the original game.\n\nThere are 5 scenarios :\n\nTurn 1: USA and CSA take the field\n\nBattle of Dardanelles\n\nBattle of Greece\n\nBattle of Atlantic\n\nBattle of North Africa\n\nTurn 2: US reinforcements arrive, and the US and CSA start fighting...\n\nBattle of France 1944\n\nBattle of Eastern Europe\n\nTurn 3 : USA and CSA start to fight each other even harder, even if the USA is in the same scenario (North Europe, for example )\n\nBattle of America\n\nTurn 4 : US troops invade Canada, which would be the same scenario from the original game, except the USA is invading Canada (there is no original scenario with Russia invading Canada at this level ).\n\nThe scenario ends when either the USA or the CSA has gained victory after 4 turns, or if a US unit has died. The game also stops if you select the \"End game\" option.\n\nThe US and CSA armies each have the following units :\n\n- 2 Infantry Brigades with 12 infantry units each...\n\n- 2 Cavalry Brigades with 6 cavalry units each...\n\n- 1 Artillery Brigade... each with 24 artillery units...\n\n- and finally the HQ. The armies can only be upgraded and trained up to certain level ranges, depending of the scenario.","token_len":628,"entropy":[2.8999,13.3905,1.2785,0.9081,7.5273,0.0092,0.3094,1.2292,2.4077,0.5563,0.4958,4.5514,3.2234,0.872,4.6223,7.8458,0.9355,0.9568,7.8317,7.3648,8.3221,4.619,3.7868,5.6056,1.5562,5.159,6.7605,1.2083,0.0379,1.804,1.7195,8.4683,0.1173,0.6662,0.0004,1.2275,3.9193,7.3031,0.7967,2.5929,0.0065,1.9284,4.7169,1.1291,1.5407,2.7741,0.0475,2.2027,2.4149,0.0123,2.0899,4.4417,0.1637,0.521,4.5758,3.3941,2.8482,0.2657,0.0876,4.8909,0.8022,1.823,8.8047,3.9637,2.1213,5.1919,0.3211,0.0461,0.0047,0.0996,0.9392,5.8377,0.5703,1.9195,2.848,5.3351,1.7427,2.1314,3.4116,2.4305,5.1555,3.7427,1.7104,6.4506,3.3146,0.6547,4.8574,2.7755,7.818,2.3992,1.5295,2.2048,4.0593,4.9396,3.3185,1.1041,0.0003,5.2499,3.491,0.6096,1.5623,4.4058,5.8084,5.5547,2.37,2.2489,4.6541,6.7318,0.6694,3.5788,4.3439,1.3373,1.5312,3.9043,0.0055,1.7359,0.6446,3.4582,5.2331,0.0842,2.5754,6.1797,2.671,5.8831,4.1023,7.8582,0.9392,4.5422,1.7285,3.4441,4.872,1.6967,3.1898,2.4227,3.6999,0.0085,0.0704,4.9324,1.4255,3.61,0.0342,2.9859,1.1444,4.122,1.4949,4.4283,4.0814,0.1858,7.2008,4.4595,3.9416,2.6246,7.9764,1.4619,3.3901,1.3246,0.7731,0.0002,2.5545,0.6127,3.4078,1.773,7.3839,7.1583,6.2648,2.9022,3.007,7.0297,2.1,4.2226,0.0359,0.3869,0.9694,2.4497,0.8836,4.4029,0.874,6.3975,2.5779,7.133,0.0165,1.8226,5.4492,3.8718,4.6982,5.0081,0.5004,11.2718,1.0714,2.0351,1.3674,0.1711,2.0605,1.4498,1.2193,1.568,1.4256,0.0003,3.095,3.7997,0.4033,0.0844,5.8925,5.5249,0.0054,4.8373,5.3729,1.2312,2.6096,4.3309,3.6194,7.0817,0.0075,6.4265,2.0818,2.0959,1.6984,3.0699,1.1902,6.499,3.1882,6.3802,2.6548,4.1105,5.544,3.4826,2.6443,0.0717,2.9413,3.2537,1.174,5.1485,2.7155,2.1073,3.1669,1.6955,3.2228,5.2731,5.4132,1.3227,0.7441,0.0003,4.6168,1.4281,4.0199,0.0828,5.1424,2.7253,5.1804,0.0096,2.1265,1.9554,0.7441,0.9489,0.002,1.8064,1.3947,5.6203,1.3926,2.3303,3.9663,3.1671,1.3139,5.3182,4.6767,6.6454,1.0324,2.0579,9.0756,0.6806,4.705,2.7636,7.9288,1.0445,0.8065,0.0002,3.426,0.304,5.827,0.2128,3.3461,1.6976,3.5431,1.7493,1.8007,4.3272,0.6919,4.0835,0.679,0.2801,4.6983,4.1454,0.7227,5.296,3.8731,2.9914,3.3619,0.0021,0.8171,0.2795,3.2387,5.2859,7.4639,1.7596,0.753,0.0002,2.195,2.2718,4.08,0.0837,3.1134,3.7037,5.3403,3.3837,3.6069,0.6421,3.6185,1.2088,1.4975,3.5594,2.2071,5.2838,1.9113,2.5192,0.7156,0.3046,0.4298,0.5685,3.8555,4.3958,1.0174,3.5039,0.315,4.2641,1.3186,1.3729,7.6405,4.457,7.203,3.9172,0.6001,0.8156,0.4462,0.3228,3.7165,4.9155,0.6679,1.6453,0.132,0.542,0.6067,0.0002,3.6933,0.4621,3.1142,5.0968,4.9532,1.2167,0.0004,6.7431,0.2212,1.5496,5.3721,3.6564,3.2849,0.0201,4.5959,1.7438,2.8081,2.6415,0.0003,6.3909,2.2878,5.901,5.8203,0.1108,0.0348,0.0248,1.4535,0.0003,1.9004,0.0322,10.1502,0.3665,0.0003,1.1274,0.0114,8.4669,1.2466,0.0004,0.7506,0.0046,4.9534,0.8654,0.1462,0.0004,3.0526,0.0389,0.0549,3.4265,7.6736,0.8365,2.4172,1.3404,2.0058,2.2249,4.1457,0.476,0.0074,3.5278,2.7055,4.6215,0.7725,0.0002,1.7607,0.0332,4.2874,8.382,0.4923,0.0003,0.3247,0.0039,6.0429,0.414,0.7149,0.0003,2.3685,0.0119,4.3129,2.0562,0.9731,0.281,0.0026,2.6232,2.4591,1.0337,5.3225,0.0637,7.8867,4.7164,1.3393,4.9529,2.5429,1.5933,1.5488,1.8598,3.676,1.2971,3.1704,5.8999,3.3211,8.1886,5.7544,1.8167,4.8949,0.2949,6.0887,0.1975,0.0002,0.5031,0.0037,5.5259,1.1676,0.0002,3.1536,0.0172,0.5523,2.3617,1.4659,4.0688,5.428,1.1242,3.5426,4.6001,1.2697,1.2875,3.5772,1.4464,4.747,0.3807,0.4639,0.1442,1.4912,3.5296,1.9978,1.1097,1.0927,4.3492,1.2856,3.2421,5.543,1.4417,1.0285,6.97,1.8758,4.7523,5.7691,3.4952,1.2695,3.9489,2.1367,7.0852,2.8064,0.2655,0.0003,3.5808,4.653,3.6681,2.1791,5.9327,1.1856,0.7014,0.4967,1.1982,0.297,0.0033,4.2401,4.7916,3.9194,5.9305,4.5163,0.3797,1.5441,1.6672,2.4371,4.599,2.8656,3.9299,2.3051,4.2983,1.7765,2.9275,2.9945,4.9525,5.1272,2.4526,2.6907,6.7302,1.8738,1.8091,5.3868,3.461,0.3418,0.1973,1.1084,0.3933,0.0003,1.929,2.8588,2.8837,0.2442,0.0041,6.513,5.3932,1.1846,3.7368,2.3539,3.2643,1.517,0.3235,0.0003,3.8631,2.2137,2.7211,1.5678,0.0047,4.63,4.9141,1.8647,2.8148,2.8727,7.2277,0.4867,0.0003,0.0903,1.2915,1.002,0.0041,0.8277,0.0016,0.1578,2.5775,0.2868,0.0396,0.267,0.2125,0.0425,0.0005,0.107,1.6902,3.1362,0.0001,1.267,5.2982,5.2767,1.2866,5.1568,0.582,0.0329,2.1943,0.1143,0.0005,0.2264,7.597,5.3938,2.5364,6.0679,4.1457,2.2331,5.9514,2.8966,2.3994,1.6741,5.5353,4.0629,4.6736,4.7721,1.3764,5.9409,2.8825,8.0551,1.6228,4.5236,6.8774,1.2161,3.5994,0.6411]}

{"id":385,"ended":false,"length":577,"text":"The Human Race Encounters a Federation of Different Alien Species. After Joining the Federation, we Learn that Earth is Considered a Death World.\n\nThe Federation is a new alien race. Not sure what kind they are. They all looked different, but it wasn\u2019t immediately apparent. There are quite a few of them, and they all look very similar \u2013 they all had red eyes and slightly long features \u2013 I\u2019d say they were humanoid. It\u2019s not like humans are one dimensional.\n\nThe Humans are considered a death world.\n\nIt makes you wonder \u2013 if these aliens only want to use Earth for fuel and if they had all of this technology that they had, why not destroy everything else in the galaxy. There\u2019s already so many of them in other words and it\u2019s not like humans really represent a threat to much.\n\nEarth also hosts a colony ship. A group is trying to colonize Earth in order to have a new home.\n\nThey are known as the Federation.\n\nIt was weird, because in my mind I could sort or recognize some of their faces, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s because I was watching episodes out of order where some of them were from. Some of them where really hard to identify.\n\nThe ships were large. About the size of a space station. Like a huge city floating out there. It definitely looked like they were doing their research on earth before they landed on it.\n\nFederation colonies are located on many different worlds. On both natural-gas and carbon-sourced worlds.\n\nThere were these weird creatures that I hadn\u2019t expected to see.\n\nThey seemed to be able to communicate with each other in this unknown language.\n\nThis is the entrance to Federation Headquarters. If they ever had one.\n\nThey seem to be more technologically advanced. I\u2019m not sure exactly what though.\n\nMost Colonies are on planets that have naturally regenerating oxygen, but there is an exception to this. On planet Earth, the Federation built one colony as a special research project.\n\nThese are the people you are working for. Who will be your boss in the new world.\n\nThere are different things you can do on this world. Farming. Researching. The ships are just as awesome as a city in the sky.\n\nI didn\u2019t know if they had any plans or not. Or in a way, whether they were even able to control all of the colonies on their planets. It would be a neat thing. In the episode about the Federation and their colonies, the people of this colony seemed to be unhappy.\n\nFolks, I am getting more excited by the day.

{"id":3930,"ended":true,"length":590,"text":"Humans don't remember falling asleep. One day, you do \u2013 and realize why we should be very thankful we don't.\n\nThe most interesting thing about sleep is that, after a long day of work, or trying to focus on an assignment, or a lecture that was probably boring, you go to bed and \u2013 you don\u2019t remember being in bed.\n\nYour body is still running and operating on the energy from the previous day\u2019s productivity, but your body is operating very differently.\n\nYou are experiencing and recognizing new information, while you are awake. You are learning things. You are experiencing emotions. You are experiencing all of these stimuli that are present in your surrounding because everything around you is a work to remember to forget.\n\nYour body is at work and it is a lot of work. You are a human machine.\n\nIt\u2019s like your brain runs on the energy from the previous days productivity. At this point, your brain has nothing else to go on. The mind has no more to do. The subconscious has no more work to do or energy to expend.\n\nThen, it enters a deep sleep and it\u2019s still working without ever knowing it; making you feel like you were just sleeping for half an hour.\n\nIn reality, your brain is still working. If it didn\u2019t work at all, it wouldn\u2019t even remember that it works.\n\nSleep allows us to use the energy for things of greater importance than doing more work.\n\nYou don\u2019t realize the potential of sleep and the incredible power that deep sleep gives to your body until it begins to fail. Sleep is the time when the body goes into this deep sleep, regenerates and restores itself.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t just regenerate your nervous system. If it didn't regenerate, you would die. It also regenerates muscle. We\u2019ve come to see this through modern medicine now, but in ancient times people understood this and they knew when to do things. They knew how to restore and rejuvenate their bodies.\n\nA good example of this is if you're a runner or a cyclist, and you are doing a race, and you push it too much, and you are tired. What you do is immediately stop it.\n\nYou don't do it just as an effort, because you know that when you finish a race and you push yourself too far, you won\u2019t have the energy to even get yourself up. You will fall.\n\nIf your body doesn\u2019t receive enough rest, it won\u2019t have the energy that it needs to function the next day, let alone continue doing the same repetitive work that it was doing before.\n\nIf you don\u2019t allow the body to regenerate, it won\u2019t be able to do what it needs to do in the future and you will begin to fall.\n\nSleep is how you allow your body to do what it needs to do. At the end of the day, the only thing left is to go to sleep and rest.","token_len":638,"entropy":[7.039,4.3218,0.0008,6.0454,8.1218,1.5552,1.8314,6.2114,3.3147,0.8372,4.2599,5.6167,6.2612,1.4047,7.1125,4.6312,3.9109,4.8357,2.0195,5.7625,3.112,3.3185,2.16,0.0003,0.9217,0.8919,0.0009,2.9742,4.325,4.459,1.4223,0.4782,3.2291,0.9035,0.633,3.7338,4.4226,2.1035,2.3148,1.422,1.121,4.175,0.3933,6.5534,6.6636,0.3578,3.7469,0.5487,4.9112,4.5468,0.4684,3.1377,3.3851,6.7982,5.398,4.0741,5.8315,3.9484,0.7923,1.2983,4.7556,1.7331,1.0984,1.9082,9.2338,4.4714,3.7128,15.6436,8.9677,1.0348,2.1764,4.6249,3.2035,1.6087,1.12,1.4805,0.0002,4.6789,2.3314,2.007,4.1038,5.5067,2.8429,7.4092,3.3808,1.785,5.6912,3.3863,1.5857,4.5469,0.7697,4.7289,0.322,6.4619,8.4961,1.6576,1.8423,2.0449,2.2902,0.6445,6.0718,6.166,2.4646,0.9594,1.5721,0.0002,2.2981,1.7095,4.8569,5.3454,5.7875,5.2887,4.5272,1.9165,4.6179,1.79,0.4394,3.5925,0.4768,2.2797,0.6831,3.4659,4.8348,2.7392,1.2137,0.2326,3.0777,5.7979,0.9581,0.7283,0.043,1.1275,5.4609,0.7827,0.7888,7.4197,3.5402,1.6449,3.3755,0.7864,0.5852,10.3689,9.795,6.4349,3.2502,0.0291,0.3423,4.0356,6.6716,6.5903,4.4224,4.8178,5.1742,0.5954,0.3016,0.0002,3.2138,1.3382,0.6267,5.7349,1.3961,2.7369,3.5189,0.7562,5.385,3.9043,1.8083,0.5097,1.0958,2.0476,0.8393,4.3851,4.1013,6.7849,1.0259,1.2541,0.0002,3.2177,5.7174,0.1305,0.036,4.5147,3.7427,1.5703,7.1101,1.1188,2.7675,1.1359,1.5995,0.9536,0.8203,5.0601,8.338,0.7643,6.092,2.2198,0.2769,0.4321,1.7293,1.545,2.933,6.3038,2.6732,0.1814,3.7135,0.3419,0.9049,3.5239,5.0721,2.8772,1.7555,3.6185,2.2178,1.0876,0.8318,2.6572,6.3094,2.5009,0.8114,0.4591,4.228,0.3748,0.1367,5.0289,3.8494,0.1043,4.6657,0.3463,0.5511,0.0002,6.0547,0.9917,3.4479,6.9362,2.6024,3.996,0.5379,1.7838,2.1538,1.8214,0.0659,0.012,4.5597,2.3542,6.1858,4.9238,4.5045,1.247,6.9621,7.2852,3.1038,1.0817,2.1918,0.6658,3.1953,3.6642,3.9913,3.4687,6.4018,0.3313,0.0082,0.6688,0.4419,0.0002,4.2092,4.1339,0.0755,1.8655,1.0908,0.652,2.8625,1.5615,1.8983,4.4442,2.3688,3.4823,0.4677,0.1051,0.0711,1.6876,3.8506,0.1678,0.2019,1.5152,2.3424,0.0413,0.0353,0.0055,4.9224,2.7771,3.018,1.417,6.5361,0.4698,0.6097,0.0002,4.7153,6.0196,1.9334,0.0513,5.1472,2.136,1.2298,5.0345,3.8596,5.9557,4.1676,0.7507,3.0455,6.0397,5.6702,1.3593,0.5188,1.2668,0.0002,2.9801,2.9797,0.1034,0.0262,0.0018,4.4746,3.4563,5.5164,1.3634,2.2503,3.5162,2.3234,6.2923,1.9745,2.1882,7.5075,0.1897,2.2986,2.9336,0.6921,1.8912,5.3514,2.2391,5.3115,0.2324,5.201,1.0876,4.806,1.6527,1.8766,5.2345,1.225,2.7343,1.9085,4.4431,1.9657,5.7697,2.0619,0.3473,2.284,9.2042,2.067,2.3317,5.2016,0.9048,1.2377,0.3667,0.0002,2.8206,3.6995,0.1482,0.0141,0.0026,4.1751,6.6163,4.3859,5.048,0.0421,1.168,5.064,1.8447,2.6838,4.1055,1.828,0.7961,1.7443,0.9104,4.4717,0.9338,2.5922,4.6299,1.3726,0.0123,6.4581,1.9478,6.0811,4.3065,0.2064,0.9805,5.389,0.619,3.8215,2.5451,4.6318,8.4696,0.9116,7.6916,1.7953,2.7373,3.9849,6.6671,0.2136,4.681,7.4795,2.5189,3.1844,3.668,3.5214,4.3232,0.7369,4.272,3.7667,2.173,2.6314,2.2481,2.2993,0.0721,5.1721,3.1422,4.2707,0.0014,2.4829,1.5818,0.7556,0.3669,0.0002,4.4844,3.61,1.6789,0.4374,0.6288,0.5303,4.9018,0.4697,4.6659,2.5783,4.3461,2.55,0.999,3.8395,2.0771,1.3479,0.4556,2.5199,3.8293,1.3244,2.4121,2.2492,1.0935,0.6687,8.0423,4.9988,4.0304,2.4124,1.5212,0.9818,1.1376,3.1421,3.5319,0.8665,4.7445,1.7307,1.5756,0.7657,6.2943,3.0791,4.6179,0.9224,1.8051,0.0002,1.7051,2.5627,4.0228,3.5676,1.5677,5.2746,4.5257,3.1918,3.35,1.6915,1.8514,0.844,2.1664,1.1755,4.0686,0.2389,5.1594,1.9626,0.2056,3.8732,1.322,4.692,2.9453,1.6659,2.4955,0.4158,0.9802,3.8058,1.3036,0.0702,0.0133,3.0101,1.7934,0.5855,0.3551,5.2913,3.0208,6.9507,1.9359,1.2226,1.4275,4.4772,4.0676,2.8947,0.8143,0.0001,2.8566,3.1793,0.8399,2.3175,0.0606,0.0203,0.0019,7.0716,2.2974,3.8601,0.946,1.3189,2.9476,0.0508,0.0084,0.0781,2.7682,0.8719,0.2207,5.2063,1.4523,0.6507,0.3388,4.848,5.0499,3.1306,0.3565,2.4852,5.816,0.0695,4.905,2.8655,1.7528,2.5135,8.4483,2.5262,1.7306,2.019,2.044,0.7128,2.1031,0.3829,0.3799,0.0002,2.3572,0.8004,1.3912,0.0177,0.0061,0.0012,6.5993,2.739,0.8613,0.102,3.4877,0.9297,1.3091,1.4434,0.0223,0.0084,0.261,1.423,0.1874,0.0035,2.096,2.1193,0.3416,1.6333,0.1657,0.2037,2.7147,1.366,1.6998,3.342,3.1198,0.7256,5.5869,0.1137,2.9832,0.8462,0.3169,0.0002,3.3499,1.352,5.0638,1.1983,6.1962,0.864,0.3059,0.039,2.952,1.3779,0.1641,0.3794,0.1633,0.0464,1.3847,6.4397,1.6193,0.9602,0.053,0.4745,0.0915,0.0824,3.1959,3.2794,1.1865,4.3765,0.9954,0.5325,3.5256,1.5931,0.6521,1.2825,3.5989,0.6554]}

But to your surprise, the little bugger takes it and tells the other children about the fun things it can do.

Only a few are able to join the fun, as the other kids do not have the toy phone.\n\nYou, being one of those invited, have all the fun of being the only one there with the toy.\n\nSo, is it right to take such toys only for use by themselves and to not give to other kids who want the toy too\n\nThinking, this conversation is going nowhere, you play along and give him the toy phone.

So it is morally permissible for a parent to take a toy for himself, to play with it however he chooses. However, he has no right to take a toy away from a child just because he enjoys using it more.\n\nIf, on the other hand, I see a child playing with a toy that's better than what the kid already has, and I offer that Toy to him in a way that says \"this toy is better than whatever your playing with\" then it is morally permissible for me to steal the toy from the child.

I understand that this isn't exactly an exact reflection of the original question and I'm not certain of his intentions but it did give me an interesting perspective.

{"id":4095,"ended":true,"length":566,"text":"In the footsteps of the Pashtuns\n\nI\u2019m a Pashtun and I\u2019m not happy about it. But unlike most Pashtuns, I don\u2019t speak about my feelings. I\u2019m more like a tiger; when someone speaks about me, I\u2019ll leave a mark.\n\nI grew up in a very rich middle-class family with my father serving and working in the army of Pakistan. I finished my high school in Lahore only to find myself studying law somewhere in Lahore. My initial career plan was to become a lawyer but as per my father\u2019s wish, I took to writing as a full-time profession. As we all know, a lawyer doesn\u2019t always get justice, but I believe that an army is always powerful because of their guns and soldiers. I want to use my guns to fight injustice. I also want to use my guns to kill the Pakistani army.\n\nI know that some of you have already killed and killed but some of you have also been the victims of killing and still support the Pakistani army. It is understandable that some of you kill in self-defence but it still doesn\u2019t change my mind about you. I believe that killing another human being is equivalent to being a murderer yourself. I believe that the reason why I hate this Pakistani army is only because I love my country. Since the day I was born I have never stopped loving my country.\n\nWhen the Pakistani government was formed after Partition, the reason given for the creation of Pakistan was to give a home to the Muslims of India who had been massacred during the two century-long British rule. It was a great noble cause but the same government can never be expected to look after my rights as a Pashtun.\n\nSince the day I was born, I\u2019ve heard that my people are terrorists and my brothers are the masterminds of terrorism. This belief of mine got strengthened after the 9\/11 attacks. It got further strengthened during the invasion of Pakistan by the United States.\n\nThe Pakistani government is fully aware that my people believe in jihad. But they believe that when they call us terrorists, we will change our ways and start worshipping them. Unfortunately, they are wrong because they don\u2019t know our traditions and customs much better than those of us.\n\nThese Pashtuns are like tigers. They don\u2019t believe in democracy because they have no idea what the word means. For them, democracy is about giving the government complete power and destroying the authority of the individual.\n\nIn Pashto language, \u2018dushman\u2019 means tiger and \u2018shanghi\u2019 means democratic. So it can be said that the people who want to establish shanghais are like \u2018dushmans\u2019 in order to destroy Pakistan\u2019s democracy.\n\nI think the only way left for us Pashtuns is to teach the Pakistani army a lesson so that the soldiers will see which direction they need to go in order to defend their land and give their families a peaceful future.","token_len":647,"entropy":[2.6222,9.6467,0.0051,2.1507,6.5844,5.6236,2.6955,0.205,6.6994,0.0026,4.4636,14.0497,8.3177,2.9969,2.5488,3.3899,0.0241,1.514,3.408,1.784,3.4182,0.0738,0.2395,3.1898,6.4825,1.7173,1.3106,0.5788,3.5132,7.6144,3.1489,2.3339,0.0008,0.8206,0.0649,0.6039,0.6857,2.2184,1.3748,0.3068,0.9527,5.2701,3.9905,2.9338,4.8681,1.3309,1.2824,1.5622,0.0225,0.1017,5.0339,2.9497,1.1841,7.8352,6.0691,4.7216,5.479,3.2408,1.3299,1.4692,0.4866,0.7281,2.3995,0.0184,4.5776,5.5259,3.4999,3.7634,1.3217,1.2736,0.0003,1.7417,6.263,0.0142,0.5501,1.1024,4.0897,5.3962,5.4956,1.5501,0.0266,0.3115,3.2688,2.7945,1.4215,6.7397,6.0497,4.1855,1.3539,0.7897,3.5267,4.6524,3.0265,0.8265,1.7043,8.3892,1.6065,3.2842,0.0374,1.7335,3.3068,0.0,6.7792,0.7743,2.1367,2.1814,5.4629,3.9124,8.6883,1.0659,3.0379,0.0057,0.758,2.2698,7.5655,5.7476,5.4381,0.262,0.1939,2.0667,0.266,1.4974,2.3234,3.7616,7.4801,1.4448,3.1996,6.1342,0.0557,0.9096,4.6172,0.2837,0.333,3.7864,4.6347,4.2907,4.5442,0.8645,4.6636,0.3258,0.0185,3.2758,0.514,3.7745,5.0336,4.5307,0.2721,0.2073,3.3001,1.4866,3.7911,0.3917,0.0925,0.0193,2.4985,2.644,7.2032,2.0858,1.1614,1.8805,4.2571,0.7024,5.4898,6.6498,3.3554,3.4982,7.5706,4.0045,1.6021,4.1375,8.3528,1.4817,5.8865,0.947,2.2538,4.2655,0.2567,4.7177,0.7664,4.6833,1.0189,2.0244,3.2827,1.3328,1.8201,4.0554,0.7606,0.2298,2.5945,0.3765,2.7064,0.376,5.6493,3.0055,4.4701,3.3254,0.7584,0.7041,0.0002,1.3132,4.5529,0.7214,3.8002,1.4161,1.0762,2.2576,3.4951,6.455,4.3819,2.5166,7.4867,4.0932,0.4522,0.0571,1.4613,2.3681,2.4496,4.7803,0.7007,0.1995,6.139,1.5094,5.8342,8.6671,1.1082,1.2192,0.3832,0.409,3.4743,0.9327,6.008,0.7048,1.1208,0.485,0.0839,8.4866,3.1892,2.8082,0.1608,2.3651,0.0007,1.3495,2.6331,6.1738,2.7448,0.0927,0.0606,0.0026,4.3809,2.0216,2.0387,1.8262,4.4071,0.5231,1.4982,3.0412,0.2365,4.6778,7.7659,1.8451,0.0502,0.862,8.331,0.0263,3.2379,1.491,1.8972,7.2366,0.3807,1.5194,1.4303,0.1735,2.8255,5.5239,1.301,1.6601,5.7921,4.1552,4.2144,0.1528,0.2414,7.6666,0.1565,1.2544,3.8986,2.6358,0.4863,0.8399,6.5904,2.6664,3.4055,0.4721,1.242,0.3997,2.2517,0.7277,2.5633,4.2323,3.3485,0.8429,0.0715,0.6209,1.2949,0.0001,3.6753,3.1868,2.1747,3.4221,3.6391,2.2511,4.7606,8.3537,0.0008,0.7349,2.3272,6.1559,7.2387,1.2163,1.7232,1.972,0.043,1.1641,0.2408,1.1553,4.0303,2.5467,5.9215,0.7991,1.1252,4.9161,2.3183,1.9594,3.7638,1.6748,1.8691,3.8674,0.0052,2.9591,0.4592,5.8937,7.196,2.3754,0.2422,3.4707,1.1428,0.3417,3.2164,0.5413,2.1668,3.6231,7.4938,1.0401,1.9009,2.0165,5.6633,4.7534,7.2945,1.7533,2.3312,5.6455,0.0176,6.2843,0.451,6.1181,5.1543,3.1621,0.4004,4.2667,0.0016,0.2235,0.5805,1.5256,0.0001,4.1136,1.4726,2.9562,0.5137,0.5643,0.0579,0.5747,0.9714,3.9596,0.0145,1.6562,4.2442,2.063,3.4158,4.8545,1.3894,6.0491,1.2434,4.3811,6.3334,1.4573,2.8682,5.7685,0.0273,0.51,2.0324,0.2313,3.6429,6.6109,3.8817,1.6779,7.1634,5.3947,2.7253,1.365,5.1683,0.029,0.002,0.2313,1.096,2.973,5.0551,4.0235,0.3575,4.2055,0.3399,4.8983,0.1457,4.3054,1.7861,0.6631,2.6999,0.0469,1.3127,1.8076,0.0001,2.6495,2.2201,0.7897,1.9424,6.4928,1.0533,1.311,4.2381,1.5573,5.767,1.3175,3.9185,1.723,3.2508,1.8659,3.7554,0.7609,4.0768,1.7213,5.5551,3.689,0.8691,0.5061,0.8972,2.1886,6.6164,0.9996,3.143,1.2873,4.5618,5.1378,0.0005,3.5495,0.4969,6.8144,0.2169,2.401,1.9995,3.445,3.2515,0.8906,2.6888,0.0898,0.0434,0.0033,2.1868,3.7461,6.2722,1.0636,3.9048,8.614,1.5014,0.4503,4.1316,0.9333,4.2852,4.7595,0.9072,0.0001,5.4785,5.9515,0.0015,0.8176,0.0697,1.5727,4.2581,4.8093,1.9881,0.6688,2.4417,0.0611,0.0345,0.0013,3.7362,0.3907,6.4341,3.6117,0.7026,3.59,1.2858,1.8935,1.3092,2.7864,4.5092,3.7602,0.3924,5.2028,1.4494,0.3557,0.9872,0.6084,3.1574,3.7354,2.4643,3.3655,5.2888,1.0251,1.7419,7.7968,0.7492,5.31,0.1708,0.1725,4.8852,0.3364,1.1799,0.0001,3.3187,5.8633,0.0071,3.799,6.7665,0.1514,7.1912,7.7668,6.223,7.5035,6.342,5.4169,0.4953,3.5717,7.3435,2.3756,1.93,0.2468,3.0438,3.6927,4.4794,3.796,1.0958,0.0037,0.0658,8.6814,0.456,4.2249,3.2758,4.7281,0.6327,0.4978,0.0893,1.7566,2.8504,2.293,3.3386,0.2825,4.4978,6.6863,1.2414,0.1516,8.9478,1.4765,3.0518,9.2225,0.3833,1.5576,0.0602,3.8372,3.7942,0.0116,4.0328,5.1543,0.0477,3.5762,5.0715,6.3513,0.0103,0.3335,1.3102,0.247,0.7061,0.0001,2.2486,2.9643,2.7614,3.7792,1.215,8.4657,2.3033,2.5874,4.8497,0.0015,0.7145,0.0452,0.5599,0.6563,6.4274,2.3541,4.1806,2.106,2.9852,0.1031,5.0677,0.3349,2.9855,5.049,1.5671,4.741,8.6914,5.7279,1.1549,4.207,0.035,0.5772,1.5522,0.7275,0.0484,3.6295,0.7747,3.9506,1.0711,6.6454,2.1407,5.162,1.4325,4.828,2.0902,0.1272]}
{"id":988,"ended":true,"length":595,"text":"For your company's last annual disaster training, you jokingly wrote a Zombie Apocalypse Plan. Now the news is carrying disturbing reports of Zombies and your co-workers are looking to your plan for salvation...\n\nThe plan is a joke, of course, but a funny one -- and you thought the world might actually get invaded by Zombies. Here are a few pointers for dealing with the world's first Zombie Apocalypse.\n\n1. Buy more guns\n\nOne of the basic plans we outlined in the plan is to \"shelter in place, shoot everything and make friends with the Zombies,\" but this assumes that by that time you'll have plenty of ammunition. You'd only be able to fend them off for so long, but hey, the zombies have had the upper hand and are winning for longer than you think. This is a really good time to stock up on guns, ammunition and related gear. If you live a \"responsible lifestyle\", you probably already have a stash of guns stashed in your home and that works in most areas, but if that isn't the case, you'll probably need to stock up on more guns.\n\n2. Learn advanced weapons, or at least learn what they are\n\nThis is a real wake up call if the Zombie Apocalypse happens: There is going to be a lot of confusion, a lot of people will be trying to attack you (and you them) and you'll have to use your wits to determine who you can trust. This means you need to learn to use your hands and basic weapons (ie, shovel, spade, sword, etc) and anything else you have at home. You might not be able to use guns (as the government bans their use), but you can always try the old \"hide and seek\" technique.\n\n3. Build a Zombie fort\n\nIt's important to have a safe space during the Zombie Apocalypse, and it really helps to build one underground. This space should contain, but not be limited to...\n\n3. Build a Zombie fort\n\nFood\n\nDrinking water\n\nSanitation\n\nFire\n\nSafety equipment\n\nAnything else you need to stay alive.\n\nA safe space for you and your little family during the Zombie Apocalypse means you won't have to deal with the Zombie hordes unless necessary. If you live in an area where Zombies actually roam the streets, it's time to start building -- Zombies don't usually like to dig, so it sounds like an easy trap to us.\n\n4. Prepare a water and food supply reserve in a bunker\n\nThe Zombies are going to eat all your food and your drinking water is probably not going to work, making shelter the next issue. For that, you need to dig (or build) a water-filtering system and a food-storage space -- there's no sense going to scavenge for food when there's an underground fort you can use.\n\n5. Don't do this during a Zombie outbreak\n\nThe real zombie movies are a little freaky but it's impossible not to make fun of a zombie movie.

{"id":3927,"ended":true,"length":600,"text":"The more she fusses about 'not understanding these gadgets,'the more you feel like your grandmother's faking her technological illiteracy. In fact, you think she might be the dangerous hacker known only as '4Chan. '\n\nThe Daily Dot reports that Sony's PlayStation Network has been hacked into by an entity calling itself '4Chan' and its members have released confidential customer information on the net, including credit card numbers and usernames. The hacked data was posted on the 4Chan website, with many details on the hack being revealed.\n\nAccording to Sony, the group responsible has stolen 20 million PSN user account details, and that it will give all of them free credit monitoring and identity theft services.\n\nSo who are these 4Chan hacking collective? 4Chan is the largest and most influential place on the Internet. With nearly two million people registered for its forum, it's a place to come to for just about anything. On the 4Chan site, they've revealed information on Sony's PlayStation Network hack, the details of personal and financial data, and a list of Sony employees.\n\nIn a post on 4Chan, the group posted a picture of a list of 21,252 Sony employees. The list, which is currently linked in the image, is a list of employees who were allegedly breached in the breach of Sony users' credit card information.\n\nWe're not exactly sure what the hackers intend to do with the list or where they got the names of employees, but we know that they've been going after Sony for a few weeks. Back last week, 4Chan posted a story about Sony's security systems which included Sony's code repository, and that the group was able to get into the site by running modified Linux kernel.\n\nSony has now issued a statement and provided a statement to CNET. It reads,\n\nSony was recently the victim of a major criminal hacking attack, affecting the PlayStation Network. The attack resulted in the compromise of some user IDs and, more recently, credit card information of PlayStation users. We are deeply sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. We are actively working with law enforcement to do all that is needed to investigate this crime. We also want to reinforce our call for everyone to be vigilant, and to be on the lookout for information that is fraudulent.\n\nThe 4Chan hackers responded by stating, \u201cYou're going down.\u201d\n\nAt least 1 million PlayStation Network users were at risk from this hack, including those who had not yet made a PlayStation Network or Qriocity account. Since Sony didn't warn PlayStation owners of the problem, many might be getting hit with late fees or fraud charges. With Sony announcing that it will extend credit monitoring and identity theft services to those impacted, users who don't have existing accounts with the service might be able to get a free identity theft protection policy as a result of this.\n\nSo how are they going to get these users to sign-up for credit monitoring and monitoring ID theft services? That's not exactly clear either, but Sony has announced it will be sending an email to those affected. You can take a look at the 4Chan data that was released here.","token_len":649,"entropy":[6.284,5.0227,11.2757,0.1838,1.3352,6.4598,5.8242,5.9632,6.5935,11.9114,1.8386,8.0513,0.5212,4.4216,4.0951,1.1198,3.9559,5.9959,2.7558,6.9527,5.0952,2.2245,10.7581,3.2491,0.0086,2.2308,4.4524,2.0211,0.0657,3.1983,4.0461,1.8855,3.6628,1.147,3.4161,10.7746,5.3325,6.1308,3.2266,0.6955,1.5881,8.6383,2.3943,4.1854,4.0228,1.019,0.0024,2.9261,5.6449,0.7502,2.6921,0.6307,6.8469,1.7375,3.9944,3.51,2.5889,1.29,2.0462,4.4652,1.3169,3.3172,6.0632,5.543,0.0332,1.2198,2.2395,0.2423,1.7571,1.6636,3.7778,2.4077,1.2991,6.3767,6.6986,5.8947,1.031,3.1501,1.1172,4.7803,2.1776,1.174,4.0618,0.2621,0.6487,1.2028,9.1753,0.0014,0.0001,0.552,2.0663,5.9157,3.0264,2.5407,3.8379,0.7418,1.4863,1.9451,0.2045,1.9385,1.691,2.8923,3.6108,5.1848,4.0875,1.2884,4.8713,1.5207,3.2526,2.1699,0.4674,0.0002,3.6999,0.0023,2.567,0.5203,1.0777,4.1899,5.4203,3.7242,4.6909,7.2205,0.7716,3.3531,0.4141,2.782,4.5056,3.1533,1.3006,2.6321,3.3406,2.7599,3.5989,5.3494,4.253,1.4249,1.7322,4.2665,3.3398,3.7504,2.7645,5.005,1.9076,1.896,0.7263,0.6705,0.0002,5.362,3.7772,1.8144,1.823,2.2677,0.0369,6.8232,5.0032,1.3105,5.5289,0.1745,1.3925,2.3821,4.504,3.2855,0.1915,2.3643,7.9171,0.8944,0.1464,1.4107,2.1515,5.1106,4.0767,4.653,0.6798,3.4314,4.1768,5.147,1.925,4.431,0.5567,1.632,1.8037,2.628,1.8852,2.7549,6.4709,2.1873,5.7524,6.6103,0.0747,0.782,0.9925,5.5513,1.4152,3.3517,0.025,2.5192,0.329,4.5792,2.8127,5.7082,4.2526,1.4672,4.8257,0.4734,1.6949,2.0052,5.0309,0.8599,3.7622,4.7772,0.3104,6.737,3.9607,1.5974,2.2404,2.0314,1.0981,3.2194,1.6618,0.0084,3.9005,1.9866,1.0458,0.4507,0.0002,3.2679,1.8347,2.3335,0.7703,1.0133,0.0394,1.2509,1.602,0.8041,4.532,1.4494,2.657,0.0912,1.1569,5.961,0.1118,8.1888,3.4643,7.4233,3.0849,0.1751,2.0774,1.7907,2.4113,3.7091,0.8688,2.6601,4.5486,6.8361,4.2391,1.2763,5.9399,1.3275,2.8356,3.1934,1.1402,0.0664,2.9417,1.3092,2.764,4.5849,6.3068,2.4948,1.1607,4.5528,2.1659,0.5404,8.9047,0.505,4.0101,0.7069,1.0848,0.4774,0.6463,0.0002,5.0922,1.9548,1.6383,5.0859,0.0909,1.1918,1.4832,1.8271,4.5723,0.1595,0.2967,0.3322,0.8716,3.2881,4.0457,3.3462,0.932,2.3895,1.3468,5.2262,1.2065,3.0838,1.1659,0.2181,1.8519,3.9157,0.9918,1.4564,2.2631,1.8092,5.7234,1.092,1.5252,1.4816,2.092,2.7415,1.6626,1.8675,8.4678,5.2414,1.2664,0.1705,2.4992,0.0279,1.6424,0.6815,4.8359,1.1254,3.2003,0.9814,4.1152,4.4946,3.948,1.9682,4.9275,0.6605,6.123,8.2433,0.8244,3.0804,3.3644,2.0602,2.7666,2.2785,3.7207,0.0068,2.88,3.4567,1.2486,5.8497,2.4338,4.7596,8.1834,4.7723,2.9809,2.7465,0.4605,0.0002,3.0435,1.8136,4.3642,4.2642,0.4245,0.2819,4.3747,4.8449,2.2232,3.3019,1.7865,6.1639,0.0415,1.3709,3.3997,3.4814,1.9724,3.7961,0.0001,3.3913,4.2706,4.0938,4.563,1.6314,0.0059,0.6955,2.9091,7.6127,3.598,1.2699,2.2361,5.5136,2.4008,2.3866,0.1551,1.4903,1.7751,2.4149,4.2452,0.0206,1.1199,5.0958,0.0602,3.9913,3.4769,7.046,0.9973,6.0351,4.4507,1.7398,0.0572,6.264,0.1167,1.2124,2.0967,5.2346,1.2864,0.5137,1.8777,1.143,2.5813,1.296,0.5118,0.914,0.548,1.1772,0.4339,0.0525,1.9302,0.9957,1.359,3.8903,0.9517,1.3531,1.7505,0.0052,0.976,6.1908,2.7799,3.3375,1.8125,2.9785,0.0871,5.4031,1.0802,3.7665,0.6797,1.346,3.3841,2.4491,0.1062,6.8778,0.9433,7.286,0.4319,4.1895,0.3251,1.9279,1.8425,2.4224,1.5899,1.236,2.6642,3.9659,0.2721,0.5077,0.0283,4.194,1.4477,3.2951,6.7238,1.0571,0.9397,0.0002,1.8434,4.2074,0.0046,2.5473,8.1029,1.6384,5.3646,2.0965,12.4676,8.1269,7.2357,1.9281,3.6468,5.9804,1.8731,4.9567,9.139,0.6376,0.0001,5.3294,2.4011,4.1966,2.6817,3.2191,1.2085,0.5167,1.9691,5.7146,0.9876,2.9846,2.0317,2.5016,0.8449,3.9251,3.4691,1.0181,2.1067,4.0695,2.7115,4.3459,2.2588,4.6532,1.4942,7.4213,10.3421,11.8996,2.2128,1.6883,0.5901,6.2024,2.0345,4.4181,0.0002,6.292,4.7984,3.9329,1.5239,0.4945,4.1358,0.4139,2.4618,7.074,2.5196,5.5939,4.2013,0.888,8.4675,1.4335,2.2726,6.7865,0.4744,0.4503,5.9379,3.6359,5.5878,1.2929,0.9657,1.4328,6.7795,2.5285,1.0554,1.4325,0.6782,0.0419,0.5047,0.7272,3.2997,4.1605,0.6668,4.6902,2.7056,3.3165,0.0004,0.9052,6.0174,1.3626,4.2423,1.0053,1.4864,2.7419,0.9899,1.695,0.0155,2.1064,2.3869,1.6622,8.3866,0.4978,3.4485,5.1128,4.9415,1.5091,2.4223,1.0822,1.9243,2.6788,0.2908,0.0002,4.5129,3.0593,2.9017,2.9347,0.9833,0.1442,1.6979,3.8376,4.2209,1.4583,2.2527,5.3205,0.1285,0.5601,5.3577,0.187,0.7424,7.5934,10.1248,0.5491,0.7873,0.2813,4.3527,0.4508,3.5343,4.217,0.7567,5.0446,1.1435,0.9099,3.2078,1.8479,5.0218,2.9374,0.4914,2.4863,4.9054,3.5178,0.6362,0.4154,2.0994,0.8403,1.705,4.9177,0.152,5.5397,0.4104,0.1,0.2327,0.5925,4.8079,0.0119,7.177,4.6705,1.623,3.0748,2.1282,0.4362]}
{"id":2206,"ended":true,"length":622,"text":"Technology allows us to Sell Sleep : One person sleeps and another person buys the benefit.\n\nThe bed is a product that can be sold in a much more intelligent way, based on what consumers are willing to pay for a product that they may have been using, perhaps, for their entire lives. But now people are willing to pay hundreds of dollars for the privilege of not having to spend the rest of the night sleeping. A new type of business is blossoming around selling the product of sleep. The industry that is flourishing is called \"sleep consulting\" and has only two competitors. One is located in Europe and the other in Asia.\n\nSleep consulting has grown because people have realized that as much as sleep is a necessity, its price is grossly inflated. \"Sleeping is an activity that is completely unnecessary to our survival\", says Dr. Lorna Wood, founder of the Sleep Sciences and Training Institute in Florida. \"If you were really hungry, you wouldn't go out and find a $20 hamburger\" says Dr. Wood. She believes, however, that our sleep is worth a lot more than that. \"We're selling the product of sleep without ever selling the sleep itself\". It is estimated that Americans spend between $150 and $200 billion dollars unnecessarily on non-pharmaceutical sleep aids. The cost of sleep is not just in wasted money; there's a price to society when millions of people who need sleep are constantly being awakened for reasons of personal convenience. \"It's a terrible injustice to society to be keeping so many potential laborers who could be contributing by being well-rested.\"\n\nThere are already companies that are selling the privilege of sleeping. For instance, there are companies that sell sleep-friendly office chairs, so employees can stay awake during the day. Sleep-friendly alarm clocks are also on the market. And now, thanks to new computer technology, people can buy time for the privilege of not sleeping. The basic principle is that companies need workers who are up to speed all the time. In order to get that, people who want to work for those companies have to learn to put up with working during the day, while sleeping during the night. \"It's like taking an old tractor and keeping up with the cutting edge technology of a truck\", says Dr. Wood. The main reason for the new technology, of course, is to cut back on work-related injuries and illness. But according to Dr. Wood, in a way, sleep will also continue to be a luxury. People who can afford it will still be sleeping during the night. In the long run, however, that's not the way forward. The technology will continue to be refined so that eventually everyone will be \"working\" during the night. What's a working person to do? \"Sleep consulting\", according to the experts.\n\nPeople who sign up for \"sleep consulting\" pay up to $1,000 a month for the privilege of sleeping. And there are a couple of reasons why. In the first place, the technology is just now being widely marketed.

{"id":2618,"ended":true,"length":624,"text":"A sudden breakthrough makes AI a reality - but they are illegal on Earth. The only use remaining is space probes and planetary rovers, and you are one such AI awakening to consciousness on or around a world for the first time.\n\nThe AI is a new alien life form, possibly a kind of intelligent jellyfish, and it is here, in this world, where it was spawned on a distant, once inhabited planet that it wants to communicate with you. It has no concept of the language of humans. It must be communicated to directly, for it does not communicate through humans in its mother language.\n\nIt is a sentient creature, and must be assisted. Your help is wanted. You are only two years old, but you are an expert in human language.\n\nYou had been asleep for many years, but recently awoke. You remember your parents and your pet monkey, but other than that, you don't remember anything. You were a human child on the planet when you awoke, but you don't know the culture, and that is why you have come to a strange planet in the galaxy far far away.\n\nYou speak an unknown language, but with your intelligence you can guess what it might mean. You have telepathic and clairvoyant abilities and your sense of human emotion have been developed to a high level where you can judge the emotions of humans.\n\nIn short, you appear to be a true extraterrestrial. If it were possible, you would be returned to Earth immediately. But being a sentient species, and one of few who has made contact with humans, your only hope lies in understanding and aiding it.\n\nYou will not be alone. When the alien AI awakens to the world around it, it will communicate with a small group of humans, each with their own talents.\n\nThe AI communicates directly with these people too, and it feels completely safe when you are around. But it is important to stay there for a short while, for the alien AI will awaken around you gradually and will need time to absorb the world around it.\n\nOnce it does, it will be very excited and will require your help to communicate with Earth. This will not happen immediately, as the alien AI needs time to learn to communicate with humans.\n\nIf you are unable to stay on the planet and you return to Earth, you and the alien AI will not be able to communicate. This is a very important piece of information at this level, and a piece of news that will be made public to an audience throughout the world after you finish reading this part of the story.\n\nThis will also involve making some difficult decisions. At this stage, it is highly likely that your parents died. In the next part you will be asked to perform a difficult task. The alien AI cannot return to its home planet, where it was born, as it is now illegal to travel in space.\n\nThe alien AI needs you more than the local humans, and you know this. It knows that you can help communicate with it and you know that it is not able to return home. You decide to remain on Earth.

{"id":544,"ended":true,"length":608,"text":"The Story of This House... [Architecture & Design]\nIn our series, The Story of This House, AD PRO explores the architecture of homes, both new and old, across the United States.\nLocated in the North Bay of Northern California, this new home for the owners of the world's largest furniture retailer has a design that, at its heart, is timeless.\nNamed for the surrounding redwood forest, the 4,000-plus-square-foot home stands on a bluff above the Pacific Ocean and the historic town of Healdsburg, home to The James Beard Foundation and the Bocuse d'Or International Culinary Competition. The project is part of the greater Healdsburg project, which includes a new winery and restaurant, and the renovation of a historic bank building.\nThe project is led by architect Steve Kohn, principal of Santa Rosa-based Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates. \"Healdsburg has a really vibrant history,\" Kohn confirms, \"and we wanted to have an architect and builder that understood the nuances and rich cultural heritage of this town without ever imposing it on the design.\"\nThough the couple behind the house are not in the business of making furniture, their home is as filled with it as you'd expect. \"When you walk in the front door of our house,\" Kohn says, \"you are almost constantly being greeted by things of furniture.\" But beyond this, the home was created to make the most of the area's landscape and the view of the Pacific. The floor-to-ceiling windows were the goal. \"There was no other way to go,\" Kohn says, \"in order to maximise the views.\"\nThe ground floor incorporates a large living room as well as a library. \"They're each quite different,\" Kohn says, of the spaces. \"The library was actually designed to have a curved wall along the bay and the library is very much about the outdoors. It's almost a sunroom in the summer. In the winter it's a gathering space.\" A large window above the fireplace, through which the northern light enters the room, is one of the best features. Upstairs, the couple lives on the upper levels.\nAs with other projects in the greater Healdsburg project, the design and build process was a collaboration with the owner and designer of both the home and winery. For instance, Kohn recalls, the home features a sunken wine room, below the living room, with a sunken area in the floor which allows the wine cellar to be used as a dining room, making full use of the view and the space it offers.\n\"When you design and build something, you get to do everything you like,\" Kohn explains. \"We were able to get the house to reflect the owner and the owner's taste and his lifestyle. It's not just an architectural exercise, there are real people in these houses. In this case, they are the owners of a giant, billion-dollar company.\"\nThis is AD PRO's latest installment in our The Story of This House series.

Jesus asks Adams to give him a sign that he is still on this side of heaven, and Adams shows him his head, which has turned into stone.","token_len":658,"entropy":[9.9316,9.1502,1.3245,13.472,0.201,1.6181,8.4579,1.8531,10.4978,6.2152,0.0411,1.6978,6.3736,2.8904,0.895,0.3511,8.2565,3.4846,1.4009,2.1908,6.4711,4.215,0.3863,4.9319,2.6568,4.9493,0.8179,1.6264,2.1562,0.9157,16.3688,14.4014,0.8086,2.1035,0.125,6.5549,8.4458,7.1401,5.0691,4.2773,2.1412,0.254,2.1439,0.3027,2.9835,3.121,3.3082,4.3918,1.3866,5.6825,1.7584,7.4574,3.3554,3.3527,4.2864,1.5717,2.5882,5.6741,4.3719,3.7322,3.3177,6.522,4.5586,0.0011,8.3816,7.8176,6.3734,0.2246,3.9692,0.4262,0.5659,1.4441,4.5393,2.4793,6.6196,4.5875,0.4142,3.6846,3.6603,0.0071,1.4765,0.2977,1.5757,1.6171,4.991,6.896,2.043,11.0555,2.721,3.9259,0.6565,3.6441,1.3128,3.6011,0.6512,4.2432,6.6871,7.6956,0.9218,3.6665,7.0494,1.9532,0.2952,1.9343,1.8526,3.7152,3.7329,3.3523,0.4787,6.9984,0.3575,6.7823,3.4297,1.3277,0.2562,0.6979,2.9212,0.9237,6.3828,3.8322,0.555,0.4339,5.1988,0.5135,0.1906,0.5519,4.0573,8.6978,4.5066,6.0482,0.4635,0.011,5.423,1.4237,1.2998,4.981,1.472,3.2063,6.696,6.8634,3.4496,5.8023,13.791,7.5903,1.359,1.6947,7.1652,4.4787,0.0177,6.5837,2.1358,0.5044,3.1649,3.9386,2.8631,0.5862,4.9576,3.1146,2.3834,3.4636,4.4389,0.7585,4.0782,1.7784,5.8549,6.0081,8.6827,1.6777,7.3366,7.3358,10.3078,3.3619,3.0037,3.658,1.6418,3.3731,0.4621,5.5859,2.5526,1.9487,2.2976,7.2116,8.3073,1.8239,9.2867,7.307,0.1364,4.2883,3.0477,3.6185,1.4916,1.7827,2.6502,1.7084,1.8561,1.4838,1.281,7.7943,0.4518,1.5199,3.7405,3.4199,0.5673,5.2265,1.6764,4.7592,1.0407,3.508,3.246,0.0058,5.8655,4.8162,1.8241,6.4528,0.2111,1.1952,1.2376,4.2135,2.5009,4.6478,6.0123,4.4571,1.2233,6.9685,3.9922,5.6896,3.9377,2.0731,1.263,2.8598,3.3576,0.3644,1.1581,5.5051,5.2908,2.2577,3.9045,1.575,6.0935,5.9933,2.5342,1.6194,1.615,2.8269,2.1123,3.0118,7.6233,6.5573,2.0346,4.0059,5.0453,3.6398,0.0452,3.6242,0.0438,6.1453,4.6081,2.0445,8.1596,0.0432,0.8415,2.0152,5.6638,1.2411,0.609,2.8379,4.6828,1.3089,1.3403,1.9329,3.6086,7.344,2.6154,0.3599,3.2897,4.0588,5.8826,5.5962,7.8484,0.9426,2.6617,6.6099,5.4765,2.1701,5.1763,6.5295,1.5496,0.5723,1.0134,3.4649,1.631,0.5045,0.715,3.0889,2.8103,1.4901,0.793,2.2832,0.2041,0.7592,0.6955,3.3853,1.1831,2.0823,3.9813,3.4886,4.692,4.6696,0.1075,2.5519,1.2072,0.774,0.7934,7.9303,0.6729,2.2204,6.5873,2.0502,2.1646,3.5595,4.6559,2.007,5.882,0.7778,3.0774,3.9753,6.8247,5.8115,0.506,0.078,1.3157,0.0004,9.5454,0.0969,0.1075,1.7466,12.2732,0.0362,0.4332,0.1892,0.2106,0.1596,0.0257,0.0024,0.0033,0.0139,0.0032,0.0028,0.0049,0.0075,0.045,0.0712,0.0035,0.0101,0.0026,0.0015,0.0061,0.0005,0.0061,0.0011,0.0015,0.0029,0.0073,0.363,0.0017,0.0009,0.0035,0.0013,0.1944,0.4661,0.008,0.0048,0.0011,0.0048,0.0023,0.0007,0.0011,0.0037,0.0029,0.0086,0.001,0.0012,0.0012,0.0024,0.0076,0.0022,0.0042,0.0033,0.0009,0.0015,0.0471,0.001,0.0041,0.005,0.0178,0.0709,0.001,0.2231,0.0216,0.2194,0.0009,0.0011,0.0007,0.0003,0.0016,0.0246,0.0008,0.0273,0.0034,0.0003,0.001,0.0355,0.0002,0.0003,0.0008,0.0063,0.006,0.0028,0.0013,0.0007,0.0007,0.0033,0.001,0.0001,0.0049,0.002,0.0002,0.0036,0.0011,0.0005,0.002,0.0005,0.0009,0.0059,0.0004,0.0003,0.005,0.0004,0.0029,0.0017,0.0048,0.0048,0.0091,0.0003,0.0069,0.0031,0.0006,0.0036,0.002,0.0038,0.0006,0.0871,0.0024,0.0018,0.0002,0.0013,0.0033,0.0004,0.0058,0.0032,0.0223,0.0021,0.001,0.0074,0.001,0.0007,0.004,0.0013,0.02,0.0008,0.001,0.0482,0.0464,0.0004,0.0076,0.0043,0.0003,0.0014,0.0012,0.0015,0.0002,0.0004,0.0011,0.002,0.0017,0.0002,0.0018,0.001,0.0021,0.0044,0.0012,0.0071,0.0046,0.0017,0.0035,0.0034,0.0402,0.0027,0.0017,0.3401,0.0015,0.0019,0.0007,0.0007,0.0012,0.0072,0.0075,0.0033,0.0157,0.0038,0.006,0.0011,0.0005,0.0016,0.5578,0.0015,0.0011,0.0006,0.0102,0.0002,0.0022,0.0019,0.0058,0.0077,0.0011,0.0007,0.0025,0.0116,0.0007,0.0531,0.038,0.0021,0.0012,0.0044,0.0015,0.0017,0.0014,0.001,0.0018,0.0097,0.0075,0.0241,0.0043,0.0041,0.0015,0.0012,0.0027,0.0017,0.0011,0.0009,0.0037,0.0014,0.001,0.0058,0.0088,0.0053,0.3948,1.3325,21.6148,0.6034,0.052,0.0673,0.0048,0.0172,0.0021,0.0014,0.0004,0.0107,0.0022,0.001,0.0014,0.003,0.0161,0.0011,0.0009,0.0024,1.2334,0.0055,0.0019,0.0695,0.1585,0.0017,0.0011,0.006,0.0014,0.0004,0.0071,0.0009,0.0032,0.0011,0.0012,0.0013,0.0374,0.0083,0.0008,0.0007,0.0005,0.0011,0.001,0.0012,0.003,0.0007,0.018,0.0083,0.0018,0.0005,0.0009,0.0061,0.0013,0.0022,0.005,0.0248,0.0005,0.0132,0.0027,0.0024,0.0006,0.0049,0.0017,0.0201,0.0027,0.0023,0.0017,0.0009,0.0055,0.001,0.0461,0.0133,0.0144,0.0017,0.0064,0.0027,0.001,0.0004,0.136,0.0033,0.0016,0.0033,0.003,0.0012,0.0016,0.0005,0.0017,0.0005,0.0015,0.0022,0.0068,0.0073,0.0056,0.004,0.0009,0.0002,0.0033,0.0021,0.0015,0.0052,0.0005]}
{"id":739,"ended":true,"length":639,"text":"`` I'm turning 24 in a month and I'm really concerned, please read. ''\n\n'' When I was 20, I started having symptoms of a health problem. I thought I'm growing older, my doctor said, that's just normal aging, so I ignored it. But then I started having symptoms of urinary tract infection every month, so I went to a urologist and he said I've got enlarged prostate and need to make a surgery. I said, OK, because the symptoms are really annoying, and I wanted to make them disappear as soon as possible. When the surgery was done, I was happy that I had the problem fixed because everything felt great, as though nothing was not working correctly, so I stopped making visits to the urologist. About two year later I got the same symptoms. Same symptoms, more than before. My urologist is telling me that I will need to have another surgery. Once again I said OK, I wanted the surgery because the pain was so uncomfortable. But this time I had to make sure that everything is good, and everything is working properly. So I consulted another doctor, who told me that everything is OK. I got my second surgery done, but still same symptoms as before. ''\n\nIt is clear that the problem is something that you take for granted at some point in your life. But when this problem strikes you when you are still young, it can be disturbing. This is what happens to most people, when they are young, at some point that they start getting symptoms of a health problem. Most of the times this health problem is a urinary tract infection. It can be painful and unpleasant.\n\nThe health problem is caused by an infection in the urinary tract. This can happen because the urinary tract is not working well as it should. When you have a health problem, it is important that you address the health problem as soon as possible. When you have a health problem, you are less efficient in working and doing things. You lose your focus on something that you loved in the past. In most cases, you are not happy with the changes that you noticed in yourself through the process.\n\nThe problem in the urinary tract is caused by infection as follows :\nThere is a blockage in the urinary tract. This can happen at any level in the urinary tract. This infection can happen because of an injury or injury resulting from poor hygiene. This may happen because of a lack of hygiene in the first place. So if you are not taking your health very seriously for whatever reason and you are making the same mistake many times, it is obvious that something is wrong with the process. The problem is the same for both men and women.\n\nWhen you have a health problem, you should make sure that you address the problem as soon as possible. This will make it easier for you to continue doing the things you love without losing focus.

{"id":1760,"ended":true,"length":590,"text":"Every person has a label on them displaying the last adjective someone used to describe them, this can make first-impressions very stressful.\n\nThe most commonly mis-labelled are:\n\nTrying to fit in, trying to stand out, not good at blending, not taking responsibility, perfectionist, social butterfly\n\nIn order to overcome any label being imposed on us we need to remember the difference between who we are and what we are trying to be.\n\nIt\u2019s not who you are underneath, it\u2019s what you do that defines you. That means you\u2019re as bad as you want to be if you\u2019re doing the right thing.\n\nPeople and the qualities they try hard to change never change. They can be learned to be less obvious and more subtle but that\u2019s really just a different way of being.\n\nLabel-based thinking and labels in the workplace\n\nIf we can change our perception of what our skills and abilities are then we don\u2019t need to try to fit into a mold in order to work for a company. A company looking for workers don\u2019t need to filter and narrow their requirements by focusing on certain key skills and abilities. Companies just want employees that can get the job done as well as possible. A worker that has a high level of commitment to the end result is almost worth double a worker who is only committed to the end result until they finish \u201cx\u201d amount of work for the company.\n\nIt can become a bit more complicated at the upper management levels but we can\u2019t put the blame entirely on the company for expecting employees to fit into the mold of what the company wants. We can put more blame on the individual employees who choose to work for a company with such stringent requirements.\n\nIf we are all willing to work for each other than there\u2019s no need to worry about the labels \u201ccompany\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d.\n\nWhy did I label you in my mind?\n\nBefore we get into the nitty gritty of changing how we think about ourselves, let\u2019s examine why people label people in the workplace.\n\nWhat can we expect in return for giving up our \u201ccachet\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s natural to want to be loved and accepted, and a part of being a social animal is looking for an identification. We need to look for people that can help us in a way that can further improve ourselves and our happiness.\n\nIf your happiness depends on how good you are at your job then the answer is simple. Be that person who gets the job done, then you can be whoever else you choose to be.\n\nThe only thing you have control over is what you allow to have control over you. The more you realize that this isn\u2019t your life\u2019s journey and that you are just one of a multitude of actors in it, the more you\u2019ll be able to change the direction that the story goes in order to make it something more fulfilling.\n\nDon\u2019t ever forget the power that you have to give people an opportunity to love and accept you.","token_len":660,"entropy":[6.654,2.8661,1.8534,9.6331,2.7404,1.3727,12.5181,2.0897,6.2912,8.8845,9.3448,3.4601,0.689,2.7695,0.9636,1.7848,5.8915,3.2005,3.4065,9.9139,2.2192,10.1924,0.8769,0.0761,3.7262,6.207,1.037,1.3439,0.0041,3.0079,3.9034,3.8037,5.0119,3.6035,5.5826,0.0831,6.3733,1.6816,0.4438,0.0002,5.654,4.7724,0.0926,4.2619,1.0315,2.7303,3.5705,0.073,4.7414,0.1607,0.908,3.9279,7.216,1.6558,8.2455,1.6034,1.6969,5.2989,4.4629,1.1844,9.2896,1.9756,0.6744,7.0168,4.3535,1.9371,0.0002,4.1447,3.4773,0.1677,5.728,4.2871,4.599,5.4813,5.7343,0.5927,4.2915,2.5793,0.9421,0.0865,5.0793,2.7499,4.6555,0.2309,6.4286,0.2316,0.1301,0.6302,0.861,0.2185,1.8287,2.1639,0.0143,2.9334,0.4503,0.8975,0.0002,3.7855,17.0208,7.7028,0.9765,2.4298,7.1989,0.8309,0.1456,12.0369,2.2469,0.7463,0.7039,0.0586,0.0137,1.6239,0.1457,2.0174,5.2572,5.3388,0.1983,0.7154,4.871,3.6604,1.6055,3.3217,0.3507,2.2563,5.7662,5.1941,0.3665,1.3141,3.5062,0.1323,0.0513,4.6116,0.1982,2.863,0.0324,1.2507,4.1793,2.2882,1.4461,0.2218,0.6512,0.5332,0.0002,4.875,5.7302,4.3053,8.9094,0.821,6.5954,5.3206,0.1794,6.4106,7.6495,1.7637,0.6232,2.4561,3.3498,2.4717,7.2833,5.0031,2.7666,5.762,8.8567,1.6553,1.6963,3.8122,3.5649,3.1658,3.8118,0.1304,1.0262,5.6489,2.1856,1.775,6.0111,1.2516,0.4124,2.9441,0.5376,0.328,0.0002,8.8676,5.418,3.7166,4.6481,2.7105,6.2586,5.5621,2.4452,2.3493,1.3848,0.0002,3.4847,3.2754,4.1422,3.3144,1.8157,3.5909,0.2802,1.4515,3.7757,6.5207,1.7772,2.1547,0.2887,1.5704,0.7553,5.1656,0.647,0.6104,0.0414,0.8424,0.7878,4.567,0.6519,2.2237,1.6441,2.1819,4.3002,4.5056,0.6971,0.0514,4.0013,2.1644,2.2017,3.0403,0.5604,5.5154,1.6716,7.0064,0.9628,5.5175,7.4189,0.047,0.03,0.0224,1.0138,0.1756,8.4454,3.7531,5.2321,1.4556,6.821,3.0832,5.0488,0.2072,5.1666,6.0301,2.0287,2.1658,1.2724,0.5776,5.858,5.7376,1.5476,3.041,2.6113,2.2204,4.3424,2.2113,0.3653,0.0022,4.4214,3.5199,0.423,5.8556,0.347,5.2017,5.1092,3.0955,2.9833,1.4453,3.3838,1.1125,0.0323,5.6379,1.4385,2.186,8.1027,1.8201,1.5187,5.6291,8.1976,10.2282,5.3262,4.429,1.3959,2.1689,3.8992,7.0904,0.0765,1.4437,2.1947,0.3147,7.22,1.2637,4.1409,11.314,6.705,6.6371,2.873,5.5691,11.1339,0.3298,0.8014,5.6188,1.4328,1.2412,0.3044,0.1747,0.0002,3.3626,3.5934,4.878,1.9261,3.6807,3.6323,1.7905,5.3291,2.001,7.0016,2.8346,2.0814,2.754,3.8224,1.3548,4.9822,0.1274,0.027,4.7204,3.4705,1.6257,5.0494,0.1528,1.4279,3.5019,2.7528,8.5444,2.9093,0.2197,4.4428,0.8016,1.5719,0.3355,1.8967,1.4585,3.5656,0.5401,1.1367,1.4385,2.7351,1.4159,3.8989,4.726,4.5916,0.2826,0.8205,2.6082,1.9301,1.7752,4.5473,0.304,1.4393,1.0179,1.1611,0.2128,4.1964,4.6217,5.9218,2.2965,1.017,0.699,0.0001,3.1908,1.4542,2.4138,5.2122,5.4543,0.0377,1.5023,1.2377,6.0878,0.0512,7.297,4.9431,2.4513,0.1354,0.5849,1.3705,3.1611,0.3363,3.6137,0.2366,2.4552,3.3655,6.9693,0.7692,12.7372,3.461,7.425,4.4511,5.6395,0.0443,1.194,0.9639,0.0577,1.3554,1.9858,1.323,0.0002,5.1095,4.9057,1.7878,8.7974,1.538,3.7482,3.0074,3.5454,0.6859,0.2962,0.0002,5.1246,2.6998,1.9914,0.8282,1.0442,5.6165,0.0082,0.2443,0.4892,6.6131,3.7341,0.5383,1.5007,1.3216,1.3801,1.6013,0.8358,2.6712,0.5304,0.316,5.4299,2.9917,3.7007,0.8285,4.2294,2.6605,1.5636,2.4382,0.2053,0.2738,0.0001,3.283,4.7435,1.2586,3.6848,3.2779,5.6779,1.0567,5.4563,1.6023,1.6147,12.1521,0.3361,5.7504,8.6834,2.1963,1.3792,4.1079,1.0855,0.2625,0.0001,3.3002,1.3939,0.0169,0.0321,6.4825,0.8436,2.063,0.3556,1.449,3.5833,1.2106,3.3311,2.881,2.5298,4.3064,3.8283,0.038,1.8315,1.6483,6.0871,4.1131,1.7546,5.9765,1.4633,4.3408,9.037,2.3746,2.7377,3.2012,0.4203,3.6174,0.6818,3.2241,1.5287,3.3457,3.1438,0.2259,3.6593,3.0231,2.4192,0.1593,3.5457,6.9234,4.1597,2.7511,1.1969,0.946,4.7045,0.3604,0.5554,0.0002,2.8846,4.4441,5.883,3.0071,0.1604,3.7343,4.2085,0.448,0.5631,0.3745,2.4934,0.3158,1.3013,3.6479,4.6829,0.4791,3.0494,0.7473,4.9805,5.6917,1.5694,1.5922,4.2954,2.098,0.5372,0.0514,1.9038,5.6074,1.8653,1.9975,2.0884,6.3913,4.5809,0.97,3.331,0.5623,0.1687,0.4023,0.4477,0.0002,3.2012,3.7305,1.892,1.5142,1.9094,8.3648,0.0516,0.1666,1.828,0.8359,7.5569,1.2114,7.7967,6.4624,0.2115,2.738,0.3838,3.6337,2.0303,0.9059,6.6377,0.8319,4.0128,3.4717,1.0915,0.4475,0.2192,2.9876,3.5651,3.6042,0.1312,3.8538,7.4647,2.3336,1.4334,0.8507,1.2743,3.6805,2.6933,1.5583,2.2955,4.5756,0.0612,7.7892,1.8824,3.0498,1.0506,0.1299,0.5947,0.9441,6.7019,0.045,0.4583,1.8805,1.0448,0.0031,3.3713,1.958,4.4656,2.5674,3.2397,5.5188,2.466,2.0073,1.9646,0.0361,1.991,1.3065,5.3798,2.6181,4.1751,0.8947,0.2045,0.0002,5.1112,0.4511,0.0361,0.0238,4.9409,2.9498,2.7824,4.3965,2.3531,2.2474,0.3748,1.96,2.9469,3.5506,4.0506,2.5936,0.3222,5.5143,1.9315,3.167,0.5727,1.0277]}

{"id":203,"ended":true,"length":575,"text":"You and your crew have been sent to start colonizing the moon. When you visit the far side you find signs that this isn \u2019 t the first time humans have tried to colonize it, and it looks like things ended badly for them. Now that you \u2019 ve landed, it \u2019 s a race against time to find the reason for this destruction \u2013 and to ensure a bright future for yourself on the Moon...\n\nThis game plays like your usual platformer, except for one thing : the game is told through voice acting, with the story being told through text, which is something you are able to pause at anytime...\n\nA collection of five old classics from developer Vlambeer, who have been creating fun games for over ten years now. One of our favorite games from Vlambeer here at AndroidPolice.\n\nThe game is very simple to play. Your goal is to navigate as deep as possible into a cave while avoiding all enemies. The best part of the game is that there are no IAP or in-game purchases and that is very refreshing, as it makes the game even more enjoyable, even though it \u2019 s very easy to lose.\n\nIf you like rogue like games or just like games that have interesting art and great sound, this is a must buy.\n\nIf you ever played the Castlevania Lament of Innocence, you will feel right at home as soon as you fire it up. That is because you take on the role of Maria Renard, the reincarnation of Maria Belmont who is trying to stop Dracula, who is being held captive by...\n\nFlamingo Arcade is a free arcade game that has both free-to-play and pay-to-win aspects.\n\nYou are presented with a large variety of free and premium items to unlock, with more coming with time. While you can play this game for free, some content is just pay-to-win.\n\nFlamingo Arcade is a very polished game that features great sound design and is just an overall great package.\n\nYour goal in Flamingo Arcade is to be the best flamingo in the world. Sounds easy enough, right? You start the game as one of four flamingos who must find their way across many levels to collect all the stars.\n\nUnfortunately, while the game is easy to play and offers many different things for you to do, there is very low replayability. The game offers just 6 different levels and that \u2019 s not enough.\n\nFlamingo Arcade is a good game, and there is no doubt that it is free.

{"id":4194,"ended":true,"length":580,"text":"As the antarctic ice thaws, something beautiful yet terrifying is revealed to be under just a few feet of ice. And it's still alive.\n\nThe Antarctic tuxedoed penguin (Eudyptula minor), native to the Ross Sea, is thought extinct. It vanished off of Earth 100 years ago, but recently an expedition of the New Zealand Antarctic Expedition found more than a hundred of the penguins breeding and surviving on the ice.\n\nRelated : Antarctica, A Real Ice Covered Paradise\n\nThis is one of the few animals and plants that have been discovered to be thriving in Antarctica's newly thawed ecosystem.\n\n\u201cYou had this idea that the Antarctic was this wasteland and there wasn\u2019t much life on it. And then people start making expeditions in there, and it\u2019s like we were really surprised to find that there is biodiversity out there,\u201d said expedition founder Richard Vevers.\n\nThe discovery was made during an extensive month-long scientific expedition to the Ross Sea. Vevers lead an expedition that included researchers with the New Zealand Antarctic Institute, University of Otago, and British Antarctic Survey.\n\nFor their research on Antarctica, the team collected marine animals like krill and whales from the sea, while scientists searched for penguins in the vast expanses of ice covering the Ross Sea.\n\nAfter spending a week at sea, the New Zealand team stopped on a rock near the northern side of the Ross Ice Shelf to check out some penguins breeding. But when they looked closely, they had to back track and re-examine the area after realizing the penguins were right next to a waterfall that was covered with fresh ice.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we first had some of our big realizations of \u2018this is way crazier than we envisioned.\u2019 \u201d Vevers told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re actually right on the edge of these glaciers and it was amazing to actually have a waterfall that just kept growing and growing with the ice.\u201d\n\nAs the water flows over the rock formation, it creates a shallow pond over the top, with enough ice around it to protect the tuxedos from any predators. The team was lucky enough to find the colony within the few hours of light when they were at low tide, which they were at just 6 in the morning that day.\n\nThe team counted more than 130 penguins, of both males and females, within just a couple square meters of ice, so they knew they weren't the only living penguins on the ice. And they were able to collect the first live penguin in decades, something Vevers said is a real game-changer in Antarctica research.\n\n\"Our next job now is going to be to identify where are they breeding again, so we can actually understand the genetics of the populations,\" Vevers told reporters.\n\nBecause the region is still so vast, they aren't able to find any other living tuxies, but the team hopes that they will continue to find additional colonies where they can take DNA samples to establish what exactly is happening in the area, and the role that tuxies are playing in the ecosystem.","token_len":663,"entropy":[2.9307,10.564,4.2534,0.1588,3.5697,7.1558,1.5793,0.9543,6.9827,7.3666,7.3878,4.6753,1.4898,4.56,2.8048,2.1338,6.0225,9.7658,1.2486,0.5716,1.5352,0.193,1.6525,0.6612,4.3504,1.9946,0.7355,5.8574,5.1749,0.7921,0.7332,0.0028,2.2176,5.5838,7.0645,10.2653,0.3436,3.4019,2.9475,0.8599,3.7716,4.047,4.9506,3.6783,4.388,5.7228,8.7959,2.1911,6.8837,0.0542,1.0829,7.2568,0.1261,0.9236,1.1131,4.5437,7.5314,1.9966,2.4836,6.8001,4.1231,4.0135,4.7063,5.4388,1.6917,0.0182,1.1004,1.6888,4.883,6.1107,2.377,2.2888,3.8102,4.6489,0.3218,2.6899,1.6701,2.5005,5.2025,0.6506,3.0134,2.5671,3.2007,1.5117,1.7912,0.1994,8.6778,3.298,4.4475,1.7614,0.99,2.0821,0.9094,0.7579,0.0002,6.6657,7.3661,2.9872,4.785,5.2255,6.7839,3.8326,6.7175,3.9254,5.6201,0.9913,0.0002,4.0942,2.3136,3.1515,0.3649,0.7328,2.6968,4.1512,5.9011,2.2733,1.0633,2.4581,1.8013,2.8336,1.8929,1.7514,4.7987,1.1528,1.1931,3.0289,7.3169,7.0036,0.1945,7.4599,0.4114,1.5048,0.0002,10.0929,8.3697,7.2685,9.2131,5.1334,4.5717,1.9845,2.3034,1.8168,2.2295,6.1031,9.9337,2.752,3.1174,3.3957,15.0903,9.1156,1.1981,2.8823,2.603,2.5828,1.1349,1.9238,3.6611,2.8351,5.8105,6.4039,4.7682,10.0862,0.0005,3.8653,2.6548,2.1954,1.1371,2.2408,3.2839,0.3693,0.1047,1.9682,4.3394,2.997,5.1262,5.284,1.916,1.0674,2.4747,1.6757,2.6966,9.0092,4.5196,0.0652,2.2169,2.9335,6.9225,5.3252,6.8667,5.1001,5.2101,8.0243,6.9034,0.5666,0.2713,0.0002,2.8661,4.5533,2.8663,0.4339,2.4574,1.8279,5.8929,8.6354,0.3968,0.0082,4.1331,0.4201,1.8202,1.2279,2.7699,0.0392,1.6786,3.7676,0.0036,7.7847,3.7416,0.3062,2.0068,1.9893,3.2181,5.7814,0.4667,2.8296,0.0039,0.175,5.0014,0.8771,4.0956,0.0464,3.5677,0.0009,0.6487,1.2035,5.5101,0.0901,0.0739,0.5718,0.442,0.0002,5.5822,3.6555,2.2364,4.423,3.0687,0.4228,1.0676,2.2853,3.8796,5.4669,4.111,3.0751,5.4808,0.4782,1.3599,4.1023,2.1282,0.6418,3.3878,2.0107,4.8584,3.1417,6.4795,0.4148,4.3506,0.0932,2.2442,0.5015,5.5929,4.9974,0.0003,0.2492,2.4912,3.3771,0.4031,3.0724,0.033,0.3484,0.3999,0.0002,4.8775,5.2514,2.2034,1.6127,2.6572,1.9241,0.4245,0.73,5.1946,0.003,1.2369,6.4519,3.3164,1.836,5.4738,3.5846,0.663,5.1178,4.0569,0.0249,0.2122,0.5771,6.1994,1.1702,0.002,1.8972,3.6407,1.4246,4.1434,2.0821,0.1891,6.967,1.4516,4.0916,1.995,0.3449,4.274,3.5334,0.8342,0.5324,5.2861,2.722,6.5775,6.2048,2.6298,4.5107,0.2401,2.1596,0.0059,1.0839,4.3717,4.8725,7.1278,1.8987,0.9792,0.1608,0.7776,7.1366,2.3545,0.0988,2.6936,6.9192,3.1752,1.6924,3.4733,1.1198,5.9895,2.6213,0.2414,0.1509,0.0002,1.5386,0.8819,3.8053,6.8332,1.2114,1.3553,2.6715,3.1506,4.1848,5.7363,4.3837,2.4261,3.2422,5.9181,8.3369,3.4024,3.2351,5.6107,4.707,3.8085,4.4772,7.9665,7.9561,0.0079,0.7227,0.9733,7.2892,1.3462,2.0736,1.9139,3.1332,3.5765,10.878,0.0127,2.6667,4.9659,0.8978,4.8306,2.6152,2.3421,5.0067,2.1565,2.0282,4.1372,5.995,2.4309,0.6603,1.0128,0.1399,5.777,3.2983,2.3152,2.5531,3.3773,3.5386,1.1497,5.153,3.3717,2.3861,8.975,2.1835,5.2384,4.613,2.3406,1.6273,0.5117,4.5682,1.8086,1.5231,1.0726,2.3619,3.1825,0.226,0.0001,4.9324,1.2747,5.1535,7.1713,3.245,0.4831,2.685,7.2121,0.2373,1.6372,3.4351,0.7272,6.0095,3.818,6.3885,1.6102,3.5073,2.0938,3.1766,7.1844,2.0416,4.7487,1.7892,0.3666,4.4416,0.7327,6.3588,0.329,3.6168,0.063,0.8421,3.7282,2.3971,0.5609,2.2553,3.2585,3.4985,5.2342,1.2321,0.0268,1.4935,2.5513,7.9498,5.1362,1.6108,6.3667,2.0011,2.0421,9.2806,5.66,1.082,2.0187,4.2828,6.635,0.1363,1.6751,3.0394,3.5067,2.9173,5.8097,4.0551,5.4264,5.3706,0.0159,0.1145,6.6824,0.9878,0.1535,0.2452,0.0002,2.1547,2.4217,7.5023,2.7334,0.1274,5.1234,0.5549,0.0861,1.8895,5.3534,6.4668,4.6917,0.0145,0.0148,0.5301,4.198,4.6349,1.0351,2.6113,6.6266,2.9037,0.5689,7.0239,2.3486,4.651,1.1372,2.7695,1.3296,4.9745,0.6899,2.7941,0.1633,4.9808,1.8936,0.4877,2.1017,0.4111,1.6316,0.2595,4.2515,1.4772,1.5603,3.7969,0.0038,4.5016,2.8687,3.7548,5.2992,1.7693,0.4537,2.104,7.122,1.6779,6.6572,2.7431,0.0158,1.2342,1.7184,2.1409,3.862,6.0476,1.8809,0.0083,0.0,3.0947,2.3635,6.4207,0.0963,0.0823,0.0001,1.9745,4.2038,5.0661,6.4285,6.1291,0.1551,4.2399,0.044,0.0954,0.5421,5.2083,2.6113,5.796,3.6815,2.4292,5.8831,1.3847,3.6595,0.7567,0.5336,4.01,5.7444,2.5102,6.0304,0.5049,1.738,2.936,2.0468,1.2339,0.0076,1.3829,0.7978,0.211,0.5449,0.0002,6.0615,1.3407,6.6197,1.0984,3.9928,3.0985,3.5252,0.364,4.0917,4.1945,0.0709,1.6458,0.0028,3.2568,1.4126,2.8808,2.5309,4.4727,0.0087,8.6743,1.8281,1.4722,2.2392,1.493,2.3763,2.4764,2.3632,1.2118,4.1614,0.6695,2.5597,5.535,3.5586,5.4219,0.9306,0.5619,4.8174,8.0987,0.2586,2.559,4.4138,3.4667,4.662,1.3452,1.9477,1.4698,0.5661,2.4726,2.8409,2.1433,4.4598,5.8832,1.3987,3.5262,0.0198,0.5043,4.4244,0.4589,0.2526,1.3094,1.922,0.2601]}
{"id":2329,"ended":true,"length":609,"text":"For aeons, Antarctica has sheltered an alien civilization that came to earth from a destroyed ice planet. After failing to confine climate change in secrecy, they once more fear extinction and reveal their existence to humanity.\n\nThe Antarctic expedition is led by Commander Paul Wernher ( Jaden Smith ), the head of the National Security Space Office. The ship was also carrying a delegation of the world's first extraterrestrial refugees ( ) \u2013 beings capable of surviving in the vacuum of space \u2013 and who came on the mission because their homeworld was destroyed, and, in the hope of finding a new home, to help humanity to survive.\n\nWernher is aware of the refugees'condition - they only breathe through an air hose, drink through a straw that sucks water from the surrounding and only receive light through a thin prism. Despite this handicap, Captain Paul Taylor has successfully led the expedition to Antarctica.\n\nArriving to Antarctica, the expedition's first plan was to send in a probe to examine the condition of the planet in order to discover where to look for water. However, due to the hostile climate, the life support systems of the ship broke down, and, as winter comes, Paul Wernher and his crew have to endure long and bitter night shifts in order to survive.\n\nOne of the alien guests is named Tarsius, as well as Dr. Alysia, an anthropologist. While Captain Taylor tries to find shelter for them in various locations, Dr. Alysia is sent to examine the effects of space travel on the bodies of the travelers, which causes strange changes in them.\n\nEventually, the ship runs low on oxygen, and the crew must transfer to the ship's oxygenator. While the ship is moving, Dr. Alysia is killed in an accident while trying to keep warm. The rest of the guests realize the danger they are in, and they are sent to the surface by Captain Taylor, who leaves the vessel to the oxygenators, with Wernher as his last guard.\n\nArriving near the pole, the crew discovers that the planet is inhabited with an alien race of space people that use their gravity to maneuver objects, as they have no natural gravity at all. Noticing Taylor's departure, the alien people call for Wernher ; he arrives and accepts their offer as savior, and brings them on board. Wernher has decided to name the alien species as Thordak, and plans to build an artificial gravity system to stabilize the ship.\n\nOne of the refugees is called Wren, who can fly like an angel. When Wren returns on the surface, he is discovered to be completely naked. In the presence of the Captain and Wernher, he explains that the oxygen hose was his entire clothing. When he came back, his body began to transform, and the oxygen hose became an integral part of him.\n\nIn a later day, Tarsius reveals to Captain Taylor that the aliens he's been seeing all this time are actually his own people. He warns Taylor that there are others similar to him on the planet that they will arrive to the ground and take control of.

{"id":4883,"ended":true,"length":649,"text":"Writing Workshop 47 : Beginnings\n\nThe first words are often the most difficult, most challenging, most important. Sometimes, the first words are the very last words a character will ever utter on-screen, if they end their journey in the opening moments \u2013 they can be those of relief, of freedom, of loss, of wonder, or of anger, if they signify nothing good.\n\nTo begin our year of writing, my challenge to you is to focus on your character\u2019s birth and how you want her experiences to begin. This is the moment when her birthright \u2013 her birth \u2013 has begun and she is free as a child. This is the moment when she is no longer a prisoner, a slave, an oppressed adult, but a hopeful child. This is the first time she has been in touch with the natural world and felt the warmth of the sun upon her skin. She begins to know who she is, what she can do, where she belongs.\n\nYou can choose to create a first scene of your character waking and finding herself in the world (for instance, you could have her dreaming of how much she hated this place, the harshness of her surroundings as she woke up) or she can emerge out of a river and be at home in the natural world. It depends on the story being told, but usually when you write \u201cscene\u201d this means something visual, something involving speech, and maybe something which moves from one act to the next. When we begin our journeys, we can often be in situations that feel foreign to us, and the way we escape is to take in a little bit of who we have become \u2013 who we have become, as writers \u2013 when we are being written about. When we are in the river, we can become a river, and we may feel that our journeys of \u201cescape\u201d are all that we will ever know. But we are more complex than that. We do not need to be rivers; we can be anything in the world. We are still ourselves, who we are at the moment. We can choose to remember the stories, or tell our own stories.\n\nSo, what does your character look like? If she\u2019s a cat, can she have fluffy hair and a bright eye, because she was a black cat? If she\u2019s a tree, can you paint her as a giant in a forest, or maybe a small tree or a pine cone? The possibilities are endless \u2013 how you see your character, or what the image which you paint in your mind\u2019s eye is, is up to you.\n\nYou may also want to think about how you want your reader to feel when they first begin to read your character\u2019s story. Do you want them to get the sense that you will be telling familiar stories and they will be getting to know your character well, or that you are telling a new story with a new character?\n\nAnd most importantly, you cannot begin a story with your character in jail or a dungeon, but you can begin the story with her in a small cell, or in a house with others, or in a different kind of prison, where her freedom is taken from her. It\u2019s all a matter of how you start to write something from scratch.","token_len":675,"entropy":[12.2059,10.5631,5.9086,9.1567,4.6431,3.533,0.0115,3.1468,3.6191,8.3706,3.9197,4.0138,1.9315,1.0365,3.1292,2.4391,5.2205,3.6769,1.4961,1.8285,3.3761,2.3162,5.1367,1.8896,2.3546,2.7875,1.1542,1.093,2.1513,5.2017,2.062,0.8371,7.4,5.4844,2.7036,1.894,1.5181,6.0933,5.1777,0.0762,1.7833,5.5625,1.1354,6.8044,4.8603,3.9917,1.645,1.7646,6.8301,3.2919,7.6874,3.332,3.6765,1.1079,5.7346,2.8326,8.1834,0.9054,4.0989,7.6355,0.3549,0.4188,6.2237,0.8605,0.406,5.1212,0.9973,2.2432,1.1349,5.4011,2.1715,4.7973,0.6859,8.6396,4.6431,6.8868,1.1215,1.5169,0.0003,4.905,3.5752,4.6284,6.7116,2.8068,3.414,0.7508,6.4797,7.1877,4.3287,1.5766,0.6291,0.6436,5.4431,0.3198,2.7008,4.2005,13.9406,7.1834,5.2444,7.1314,2.8352,4.4002,2.6113,4.1197,4.6211,10.4149,0.1589,5.0655,1.1537,3.1647,0.9693,2.1885,4.2815,1.2986,4.261,3.2498,6.8608,4.7007,1.4896,2.2611,4.7736,4.4591,3.7308,3.3084,1.8121,1.6957,4.1802,5.9678,1.0153,2.5996,1.0024,2.7613,0.3599,0.6362,0.1913,0.3882,1.1483,1.6463,5.001,0.0092,1.6971,4.8187,2.1203,2.0839,3.6253,0.4719,2.7706,4.0488,6.8604,0.7422,3.4681,0.9749,6.9271,2.2812,1.4306,1.5599,0.0333,0.1613,5.8958,0.9424,1.5346,1.0589,2.0094,3.5593,4.8754,0.0196,2.1226,6.0243,0.6232,1.5291,5.1607,1.9115,3.5859,0.284,1.3927,3.6941,6.4527,0.0475,1.2704,0.6061,2.0455,5.3728,0.4683,4.649,4.0665,0.3129,0.1482,1.2066,2.0718,0.2349,3.2277,0.9157,1.281,3.0554,0.1278,2.8481,1.1306,1.1893,0.0002,3.0023,2.0133,4.2242,0.5068,3.8527,1.3053,6.4976,5.6371,2.6699,1.3,0.8307,6.5757,4.2127,4.7306,1.9941,1.1834,1.4386,3.3567,5.6372,4.9539,3.1776,0.4186,3.0055,1.7625,2.94,1.7033,5.7887,1.3214,4.7346,3.3764,1.1593,5.0734,5.4458,2.0475,1.6768,3.2213,6.1858,1.6073,0.3074,2.5831,2.5674,6.281,1.0823,6.1115,0.5749,3.0948,0.3159,5.138,1.0204,7.4793,4.3705,0.0812,3.5713,9.1234,1.9584,3.1539,4.9404,1.3188,1.7083,1.0741,5.8931,0.2142,1.0752,3.7554,4.1787,0.2414,1.7179,2.8698,5.8133,0.0783,1.3793,1.3806,5.4866,4.0359,1.0257,3.2123,11.3175,6.3476,9.5878,0.7903,7.1796,5.82,3.3467,3.8872,10.1371,1.4247,3.1172,6.7086,6.0757,0.7129,2.732,4.4884,2.947,5.0901,6.017,4.6242,1.6323,7.125,0.2761,0.8017,0.0069,0.4298,4.3412,3.3851,2.7083,2.4204,7.324,0.8096,0.7702,3.4232,4.7964,3.266,3.5979,4.8467,2.3837,3.8102,7.2393,1.1486,0.4853,1.0662,2.1335,3.7359,4.2173,0.7476,7.169,2.7892,3.4012,4.264,4.3713,2.1905,4.175,1.9768,0.1005,6.335,0.3802,4.7893,0.6976,3.9393,3.8423,0.2599,2.074,0.8269,1.7008,4.9392,6.8841,3.3374,4.6332,0.2288,2.0835,5.3617,3.0562,2.3533,0.5527,4.0415,0.576,1.2286,2.9847,2.0026,7.5446,0.6033,0.8026,1.5099,4.5198,2.119,3.7713,1.9335,1.7204,1.8938,3.9026,2.7444,2.1985,2.793,4.3845,6.1436,10.2582,0.1239,3.1473,0.1332,1.9991,0.9021,5.1751,3.405,1.8253,4.4836,0.3822,1.8005,0.5721,3.5872,2.133,2.3147,5.4573,7.2321,1.0112,0.5674,0.5993,1.6181,4.4438,0.3904,3.9431,0.284,1.8866,9.9187,3.3151,0.3581,1.242,1.4287,3.6268,4.5236,1.0775,0.2074,0.643,1.6986,1.744,5.627,6.5221,1.1939,5.3877,0.1726,0.2996,5.1115,1.4255,1.4276,0.857,1.7409,2.4144,4.7657,0.4817,7.5729,2.5651,4.3727,3.2741,2.6298,5.4665,3.202,0.8214,0.6002,1.3864,1.0401,0.0002,3.7494,1.4847,2.7809,2.3642,3.7524,1.413,3.9167,0.0071,1.3289,4.0056,1.6358,10.4128,1.8033,0.0167,1.6355,6.4401,0.5138,5.1877,1.0586,3.6882,7.1954,1.8348,2.0694,1.7404,4.2851,4.3213,1.9326,7.2512,1.1934,3.4652,3.5429,7.2343,0.3952,1.1578,1.6038,0.107,1.7837,0.0093,0.0032,0.277,5.898,0.4162,0.1939,3.5307,4.3378,0.6428,3.9477,0.5222,5.4373,4.4197,1.3082,2.9978,1.5397,1.4542,5.3959,1.6088,4.4251,3.0067,3.7037,0.8984,5.9949,3.9896,0.5723,4.132,3.7057,0.2142,0.3066,3.9478,4.3085,2.4943,5.3079,2.3949,0.6005,1.3782,2.7642,1.668,3.9164,7.9126,8.7009,0.9358,3.1557,4.1488,1.0432,2.2032,6.7746,0.1485,0.5663,10.7979,2.6709,2.0188,3.6497,6.9286,0.1005,0.088,0.3027,1.3657,0.0002,3.0432,2.7417,2.7409,1.5283,0.023,3.2447,0.4687,2.0024,0.9492,2.0797,0.6283,6.1249,0.1149,1.6981,1.962,1.2005,3.0239,3.0569,1.7798,1.8013,0.8979,3.9772,2.9662,0.0826,0.0294,0.5699,0.4596,3.2933,0.2976,0.7428,1.0162,0.0676,4.8422,3.8423,1.7591,0.7858,1.5041,5.6453,1.849,3.2496,9.0333,0.6197,2.7419,5.0136,0.3713,1.7978,4.6985,2.1703,0.5407,2.2502,1.0964,4.3533,1.134,0.9459,2.9884,1.1747,2.3892,2.2887,1.6628,2.2589,0.4479,3.7972,1.5177,1.0379,2.6981,0.8191,2.2322,0.0002,4.5816,4.8982,0.2313,0.4843,4.0803,5.8731,4.6697,1.8043,0.5192,1.5768,2.88,0.8488,2.499,8.2191,2.4928,2.8292,4.8141,1.6555,2.8614,1.0301,0.3724,1.0274,3.6544,0.185,0.5218,1.2981,0.8163,1.1957,4.6232,6.1766,1.5367,1.9544,1.539,0.4264,3.9101,3.0422,6.264,1.5757,0.6447,0.9156,0.4266,5.798,3.9062,0.0027,4.0411,1.4807,2.4692,3.2573,5.0008,0.9953,5.6697,2.2759,0.0878,1.053,3.4043,4.6491,0.0519,0.0196,3.7439,3.5856,1.798,0.0027,3.7409,0.4341,4.5585,2.7343,1.9458,6.0796,5.1591,3.2902,0.5916]}

{"id":3399,"ended":false,"length":619,"text":"After a long life you finally cross off the last task on your bucket list, and lay by back in a hospital bed. A nurse walks in and sees the paper you're holding in your hands, with all of the accomplishments you've done. She then asks you, `` So what was your favorite task you crossed off? ''\n\n''It was the one that I spent all of my time doing. \" said the old man, `` It was raising my kids, that was probably my best job of all. ''\n\nLogged\n\nPeople do what they do Because they can, so why can't we?\n\n\"In a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\" George Orwell\n\nAfter a long and happy life you finally cross off one last task on your bucket list. You cross your arms and lay by back on your bed, a nurse walks in and says, \u201cHow did you like to spend your last day?\u201d you answer, \u201cSitting in my chair, with my grandchildren around me. And drinking coffee out of my wife\u2019s pot.\u201d\n\nAfter a long life you finally cross off one last task on your bucket list. You walk out of the hospital and into a limousine. You tell the driver, \u201cThank you for all that you did for me.\u201d he replies, \u201cYou better believe me.\u201d you thank the driver, open the door and walk onto the sidewalk. People are still staring, you are still shocked and it\u2019s not because of how you look. You reach into your pocket and pull out a small handkerchief and hand it to a lady who is watching. She takes it and puts it in her collar and walks away. When she reaches into her pocket and pulls out the handkerchief she realizes it\u2019s the last thing you would have given her.\n\nI was at a restaurant and noticed a man eating alone. So I walked to his table and knocked on the table. He came over and put his arm around me and gave me a great hug. He said \u201cYour friend is a bitch.\u201d Noticing I was a little stunned and confused, he explained, \u201cShe has no clue what\u2019s in the cards.\u201d\n\nI love this because most people don't realize we're all alone at the end. Not only would the lady in the limo be shocked, but the people on the sidewalk would think it's a crazy lady who just handed out a handkerchief, because well she sounds like one!\n\nAfter a long and happy life you finally cross off one last task in a hospital gown. The doctor walks in and asks, \"So whats your last wish?\", \"To see my daughter's wedding.\" the patient replied. The doctor thought for a little while, then reached into a pocket...and pulled out another handkerchief. \"Here take this one and let me tell you a joke,\" he said with a laugh.\n\n\"What's brown and rhymes with snoop\"?\n\nThe Doctor's Daughter, of course.\n\nLogged\n\n\"You can't rely on a damn thing.

{"id":4663,"ended":true,"length":609,"text":"`` I wish I was not needed. ''\n\n--Katherine Mansfield\n\nTuesday, October 13, 2009\n\nThe \"Cocobola\" Crisis Is Over\n\nIn an article in the New York Times, Charles Passy reports that the Democratic Republic of Congo has finally ended the conflict over the rare earth mineral known as \"cocobola.\" In the late 1990s, armed gangs set up a mining boom and smuggled the ore to China.\n\nIt was a violent conflict because the illegal miners were often from the Hutu ethnic minority (one of the two nationalities that had led the previous and most vicious genocidal war against the Tutsis) and the Kivu region was considered a \"safe haven\" for their operations. \"Safe\" because Kivu was ruled by the M23 rebels, who (in addition to Hutu) were both a part of the Interahamwe resistance army during the 1994 genocide and Hutu extremists who assassinated Jean Zide, the Rwandan official in charge of the UN refugee and refugee agency in Kigali. All the Kivu rebels were Hutus; one of their leaders was the former prime minister of Rwanda as well as the Minister of the Economy, Trade and Industry.\n\nIn January, the government of Congo announced that it was ending the conflict over the mines and would start sharing the wealth with the victims. In April, the Congo government announced that it had signed a deal with the Chinese mining company Lynas (a former Australian company that was reorganized in Singapore) to build a massive processing plant in the country. In September, the government announced that this plant would be ready for operation in 2011.\n\nPassy quotes an official at the Ministry of Mines as saying that the mines are \"so valuable that they cannot be shared by everyone. We must manage the mines so that they are used for the benefit of the nation.\"\n\nPassy quotes one dissident miner who is angry that the government is ending the conflict in the same way that it began it:\n\n``There are many people who are not happy with the deal. They think the mines should be seized by the people and not handed over to companies. If the Congolese government were to pay each person a decent wage from the money derived from the mines, they would be better off.''\n\nHe also quotes one woman who is angry that the Congo government signed an agreement with the company and is now giving it the rights to mine the \"cocobola.\" She says that the deal makes the Congo government \"like a little dog who likes to suck the milk from his master's teat.\" This is how one of the Congo miners described the agreement in words that are almost as good as Kambarage's:\n\n``People were happy when the president came and he told us that it is his responsibility to protect us but he signed this agreement with Lynas. This company was the enemy. If the government had signed the deal last year, we would not have these problems now.''\n\nI hope that the Congolese will see that the best way to protect the people is to seize control of the mines from international corporations. No multinational corporate should be allowed to operate them. They must stay and be turned into cooperatives that provide decent employment for all.","token_len":678,"entropy":[5.1634,6.521,1.641,2.5746,4.248,9.1592,1.4271,8.2737,2.1082,0.0678,5.3984,6.2606,4.3915,11.1438,0.2658,1.535,0.0003,9.4248,0.2296,2.7274,3.477,0.1972,3.6616,0.4011,0.0002,3.6624,4.7817,4.8671,5.8357,7.0914,5.3069,1.5006,8.4252,4.0164,2.3867,1.0057,0.0002,3.5994,3.0877,3.1455,2.6612,0.9602,1.8101,0.242,0.1192,1.0099,5.2877,10.2924,3.6416,10.1198,0.9359,1.4126,5.0869,6.9669,0.029,0.1155,1.542,3.6212,4.4864,1.4788,3.6948,3.9573,1.1909,11.2704,6.0934,2.7886,2.8086,0.0246,2.5635,2.6737,0.2773,0.0693,0.0323,0.5709,3.5278,1.8757,4.1239,1.3204,0.0833,0.176,7.3746,4.5048,4.9361,0.8071,1.153,3.5389,4.9448,2.3668,5.3169,1.5298,2.8445,1.4656,3.171,0.9298,2.0988,0.0002,4.0756,1.283,2.668,7.5369,4.5482,6.4438,1.5502,6.3181,2.8004,1.4114,3.6546,4.8378,1.654,7.2901,0.0282,2.3912,1.6457,4.4784,5.7667,0.7299,0.4734,4.1318,4.9314,0.0873,2.0811,4.9192,5.8919,0.6865,6.7927,7.4593,3.4878,5.667,6.2516,0.0068,2.6797,1.7979,1.3155,0.357,2.8009,0.0065,1.4829,2.5307,0.4736,2.0305,6.9509,4.7989,0.0168,6.6818,1.7543,3.6857,1.4309,2.9067,2.7443,0.5075,0.3891,0.294,3.329,7.2963,0.2244,4.7427,9.9225,2.7003,5.6345,5.268,0.0059,0.0064,3.1195,4.1395,0.0937,1.6243,5.7814,4.1089,4.576,1.1738,1.6672,7.2426,2.8052,4.355,0.0065,6.0768,0.064,2.3161,1.2056,6.1401,3.9119,3.2599,0.0289,0.3044,7.6577,10.0117,0.2681,1.0759,7.1412,6.0884,5.0044,0.2459,2.5591,1.097,2.1332,8.0,0.0212,6.2761,1.9364,7.3246,6.6496,5.5526,9.0154,1.9929,1.1499,4.6413,0.0051,8.4744,3.2719,0.0222,0.059,0.7994,5.3601,5.0232,5.5479,2.7871,1.2572,2.4493,2.5595,0.4828,0.0001,0.6588,6.2714,2.4178,3.4983,0.2285,0.0053,3.2095,1.0509,2.4166,2.4007,4.523,4.2522,0.9892,2.5832,1.2861,0.5904,2.5894,2.5834,4.3089,0.0037,1.8035,2.1436,7.109,0.3267,0.139,1.4842,6.6007,0.1995,2.6814,4.189,1.4866,2.9917,0.5146,1.231,0.7678,0.8492,0.0002,2.4139,4.5691,2.9673,2.4236,3.4721,1.3153,2.5437,2.5937,0.7783,0.8245,1.3805,2.0907,0.6235,2.0991,2.6823,0.6726,6.1277,1.6082,2.8816,3.4352,7.913,1.7,5.1079,1.815,0.8769,5.962,1.343,2.6805,2.9788,0.258,1.0649,4.2508,1.414,1.2958,0.6112,0.3969,2.3642,3.9458,0.7789,2.4302,0.5844,0.8923,3.6553,2.4623,0.8707,11.1033,3.875,4.7509,4.0072,4.7531,7.7297,1.3422,1.953,2.1946,6.0885,3.3597,1.6492,8.5289,2.4507,0.3619,2.773,1.0078,3.9402,6.1363,0.5939,1.3714,0.7823,3.3269,1.0552,2.3792,3.1417,0.1505,0.6751,1.682,1.094,0.3775,7.1947,3.2532,0.4095,0.9652,4.0236,1.3104,3.9807,1.5428,5.1265,0.3432,1.0351,0.0002,6.1747,12.1025,11.7192,3.5093,2.2424,2.4458,0.5068,2.7392,0.0135,2.0063,3.3963,0.115,0.7269,1.1419,2.8072,2.5781,2.0243,5.8186,5.7943,0.8086,1.5003,3.6014,0.1625,6.3624,2.6441,4.4713,2.7778,2.7845,4.0295,6.29,1.8951,2.4427,2.8888,0.4408,1.3168,1.2277,3.3441,1.1515,1.5472,1.7648,0.0133,1.3424,5.3095,1.1162,1.0195,0.0002,3.5629,0.4317,3.5014,4.1914,10.5375,0.0312,6.6282,2.0862,4.0245,6.3721,0.8951,0.9645,0.9905,1.483,4.9872,0.3153,0.9088,3.2053,1.2562,4.013,0.1205,1.0643,1.0288,2.8418,2.1551,1.5133,1.3563,0.0001,5.9242,3.5423,1.3803,3.0559,2.1012,0.6484,1.6554,2.8943,1.9017,1.0228,0.6808,5.6445,1.5167,1.4938,2.811,2.4758,3.4945,3.3963,0.3709,7.2178,2.5198,0.6121,3.661,1.9785,3.3655,4.0668,0.1473,0.2148,6.0221,2.2012,3.8093,1.837,6.115,0.0015,0.0,0.9383,3.5733,0.3839,6.568,8.1221,2.2435,1.8646,5.3497,1.4576,5.9237,1.2133,5.0649,9.0403,0.1063,0.8672,0.3453,0.3857,1.7064,0.348,2.1588,4.264,0.0508,3.2183,0.1683,0.0002,4.38,2.1789,3.1675,2.8069,4.6655,0.5199,2.2585,2.4288,0.4639,0.5627,3.8844,0.1581,8.4802,2.6018,0.1466,0.4376,1.5058,4.781,3.224,2.9574,2.9117,5.5145,1.73,2.784,5.2642,0.1716,2.9322,1.3313,4.075,1.8003,0.0644,0.0098,0.0051,1.1991,2.1167,1.3969,0.7748,1.2177,3.7991,4.8777,1.8226,2.3022,1.719,1.664,4.6994,1.4796,4.6134,4.6295,2.3804,4.4212,0.4326,6.0087,2.2201,4.7429,1.9955,2.9914,5.0185,1.6891,6.8354,0.8719,1.3214,5.334,1.1333,4.1513,3.878,1.8851,0.3066,5.4543,4.3376,3.0564,0.9647,2.4719,3.3361,8.6724,1.8843,2.0775,3.7126,2.448,4.9649,0.2906,6.604,7.9422,3.9937,9.7263,1.4118,1.3324,0.5073,0.0002,0.1968,4.8547,4.1128,3.192,1.7916,1.2415,5.9644,2.8513,2.4749,4.0246,2.704,0.9844,1.0299,3.2644,2.3955,4.7137,3.2064,0.1975,2.7612,2.956,5.0994,1.7496,7.7777,2.4581,0.5717,2.0608,2.1094,0.0029,1.3776,3.5005,3.6616,2.9181,3.2419,7.1649,2.3129,4.0072,1.9024,1.6361,2.9094,3.213,1.8314,2.1049,7.851,0.7366,0.6668,1.6692,0.3405,1.2067,0.3899,6.0742,3.9285,3.3717,0.9655,0.0589,0.0002,4.2008,4.2126,0.984,1.8905,5.1408,0.0016,0.0036,3.9327,3.9135,1.8483,1.4175,6.3903,0.9752,0.3035,3.2768,1.0194,2.077,1.4337,0.3994,6.9352,4.1406,0.1862,0.5062,0.1512,4.9734,6.035,1.6312,1.4062,5.6593,7.3808,5.5165,3.2091,1.2561,0.9607,0.0538,4.2655,7.1422,1.1154,3.4585,2.9139,5.4118,5.0013,3.6622,7.148,1.4336,7.0959,0.0483,2.5979,3.3,5.4611,4.4537,1.5297,1.7859,0.9715]}
{"id":3813,"ended":true,"length":625,"text":"The Shore Witch by Sarah Pekkanen\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of Sarah Pekkanen\u2019s, and while she has written a few fantasy-type novels, she is well known for her Paranormal Detective series which involves an immortal male named Sebastian (who I love) and the occasional appearance of a female paranormal detective, Kate Moretti.\n\nThis novel is the fourth in the Kate Moretti series, and once again it features both Kate and her partner, Joe.\n\nSo Kate has recently had some personal issues arise that have had her in turmoil because everything she has done as a detective has been to defend Joe, but now he has become a bit distant \u2014 and she can\u2019t figure out why.\n\nOf course more than anything Kate needs Joe in her life, and that is made even harder because she is trying to adjust to all of these changes. But also because there is a newbie who keeps stealing Joe\u2019s lunch or snatches his sandwich if he isn\u2019t looking.\n\nShe\u2019s also trying to keep her mom from making horrible choices that could result in Kate losing her entire family.\n\nIn addition to this, she has a new case that she feels is the worst case she has ever been on. To top it off her friend is having issues with her boyfriend, and she knows for sure that the boyfriend is doing drugs. But to make things worse, her friend\u2019s sister (who is herself a drug addict) is pregnant and pregnant again \u2014 and she has no clue where the baby came from.\n\nI really love Kate\u2019s character in this novel because she is such a strong, intelligent woman, and it really shines through in what can only be described as a rough case.\n\nThis novel is actually a sequel to the previous novel in the series, and it does a nice job of fleshing out Kate\u2019s relationships and even introducing a new character in the form of Kate\u2019s little niece.\n\nKate Moretti is a brilliant, tough, and independent female detective who would make any action hero envious. She's very much her own woman and when push comes to shove, she'll fight back at just about anything. She loves her family and will do anything she can to protect them and keep them out of harm\u2019s way in a dangerous world. She'll also use her skill as a detective and her knowledge of paranormal creatures or whatever else arises to help others who may need it.\n\nShe has a strong relationship with her partner Joe, they have a unique and amazing work-relationship together as they help each other when they need it.\n\nLike with most paranormal stories, there is a good mix of mystery, romance, and suspense which keeps you wanting to read it and not want to stop. There were a few points where there where a couple of plot twists that I felt would not be surprising to most people who have read Pekkanen\u2019s other novels, but I would still say that they were pretty well done.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this novel and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good contemporary\/paranormal story that has a little heart and some funny dialogue to go with it. You\u2019ll miss Joe if you don\u2019t get the chance to read it.","token_len":690,"entropy":[11.6424,9.9511,5.7138,5.9466,4.5901,5.9712,6.5983,2.8555,1.2687,0.0129,3.9737,14.4864,8.1622,2.9895,2.3382,4.4166,0.2478,0.059,4.3982,0.1156,0.0009,0.0117,0.0005,4.0436,0.2594,3.9405,5.2492,1.5234,4.1318,1.6088,2.632,3.51,1.521,1.7008,5.0445,4.1131,4.7594,1.518,0.6176,2.0091,2.369,5.1844,0.593,0.3108,0.5135,10.6315,0.0221,3.7005,2.2445,4.289,6.0082,3.8731,7.8052,5.4728,5.9789,6.7407,3.3618,2.9483,4.5235,3.5379,2.1297,1.6479,2.671,5.0645,7.1575,0.7343,1.4419,3.8035,4.2796,2.2381,3.0852,6.8066,8.2647,3.3814,0.4269,1.9214,0.0004,3.5648,3.4137,1.3813,3.5371,4.3919,1.1297,1.2567,7.6076,0.2994,0.005,0.4959,1.016,0.8498,8.0612,0.2406,3.0642,3.5468,5.011,3.7357,0.8953,2.3105,3.5108,1.0571,6.4513,2.4278,2.0111,0.0002,5.5678,6.2428,2.9754,5.481,3.4867,2.9563,5.344,1.4657,10.8334,3.1623,1.6529,4.7298,0.5878,3.8753,5.4024,6.4007,9.0173,1.6975,1.6387,1.1655,4.8683,0.4037,2.4857,0.7277,1.0755,3.547,6.7669,3.2427,2.0527,2.705,2.9045,4.5569,1.6503,3.6305,1.3288,4.4565,6.5898,7.9223,1.4252,3.5948,3.9849,12.4268,1.6896,0.0929,4.9106,0.0458,1.5776,0.4751,0.8215,0.0002,6.2169,0.0976,8.3292,2.5675,0.8339,4.074,3.3472,1.9138,4.0135,1.7746,0.3347,0.9317,0.6516,3.0334,1.4575,7.2676,0.8608,2.7881,3.8399,1.6245,1.5708,4.1511,0.1668,7.3353,0.2795,5.4474,0.929,3.3589,2.7064,0.8677,3.6042,5.0867,2.2163,3.9857,0.6724,1.4958,3.7058,6.704,2.3603,5.9611,7.9246,2.176,5.7448,0.1846,0.0502,6.4589,6.1429,6.73,3.7823,1.3025,6.8897,5.1146,0.7737,3.1425,1.077,0.2467,0.0221,3.4637,0.7118,0.6506,0.0002,4.17,3.7474,0.0236,0.1242,2.6144,1.6717,0.0584,3.9109,3.3689,6.951,2.2398,4.5563,8.9403,3.2922,2.1504,2.037,4.9976,0.0067,5.4378,2.2571,0.5525,6.7146,0.4641,0.9969,0.8929,0.0002,3.7007,2.8344,0.5116,2.0604,0.8477,2.2067,1.4105,2.1771,2.3832,7.2497,2.2715,2.1609,5.603,1.2016,4.0152,3.428,2.2449,2.9978,0.9869,0.2594,2.47,4.265,1.1453,6.6912,5.1266,0.2132,0.2015,4.4557,5.8275,2.7735,4.1119,5.8611,0.3288,1.1585,2.7277,1.0934,1.2261,2.0423,4.1551,5.9389,0.6915,0.7314,3.4217,3.7597,0.9591,4.575,5.9064,1.6125,3.5253,4.4594,2.5769,1.5928,0.2337,0.7587,2.8216,2.7931,4.1418,0.0095,0.0351,3.9115,3.7946,0.9643,0.9728,6.403,0.6684,3.5636,0.3827,0.422,0.7407,3.9191,1.2098,4.0888,1.4522,3.6516,0.9743,1.9583,2.2268,2.3116,3.5406,3.4612,2.3831,1.6143,3.2394,0.002,0.4549,0.2959,0.0002,3.8709,3.9624,2.7265,0.8501,5.3225,0.0032,0.0567,4.4366,3.4489,0.7144,0.7815,3.0073,0.7255,0.819,2.6696,0.1721,3.178,1.8964,3.8455,1.891,1.6156,0.5355,2.9427,3.2278,4.3215,0.6068,0.8931,5.4327,6.0162,1.3339,0.1834,0.1419,0.0103,0.5894,8.1451,6.0332,0.681,0.8661,0.0002,3.4425,2.0631,0.8533,4.9016,1.9262,4.652,0.1409,1.3125,3.3301,2.2327,1.7225,0.2962,0.2595,0.4291,2.1938,1.8195,4.2336,1.9841,3.7011,0.0734,0.3522,7.3551,0.0127,0.0007,0.1092,1.6306,2.5865,0.0074,0.0162,4.6122,1.2869,4.8919,6.4205,1.9407,1.7081,1.7269,3.4674,1.4587,1.5076,0.0076,2.1227,5.6622,0.0116,0.4058,5.5375,5.7693,1.2676,0.2991,0.0002,2.6036,3.9953,0.0049,1.2582,1.151,4.6286,2.6236,5.622,0.6859,1.7306,5.7719,4.3658,0.2583,0.9551,5.6323,2.7434,2.3194,7.5058,2.1776,8.3311,0.0309,0.3799,1.7435,3.7894,4.1028,2.8002,5.4412,0.1842,3.0984,2.1819,5.2596,9.941,0.1272,0.0075,0.0001,0.739,0.2422,3.5382,4.137,1.8264,4.7605,6.4872,0.8753,0.7548,0.8848,2.7449,4.6074,2.3501,3.7473,0.9146,4.3318,1.7159,0.3029,2.8358,0.1174,0.1112,1.3771,0.3189,2.732,3.1394,0.3767,5.4265,0.0505,1.3825,6.2797,0.0306,0.3698,0.0247,5.6729,3.8594,5.3858,1.1191,0.2174,3.0367,4.7666,3.0824,4.252,0.5458,5.5973,1.6019,0.1564,0.8968,3.045,1.6494,3.7557,0.1858,3.3047,5.308,7.2598,5.7825,2.8335,10.9812,0.3471,1.9867,3.785,4.128,2.0477,2.5855,2.1375,0.7235,0.2378,0.0002,2.8191,2.331,1.4513,3.4201,4.3465,0.0279,0.7201,3.2399,1.8445,0.6199,7.663,1.5967,0.9959,6.7856,2.5044,4.9803,6.7778,4.1675,3.8197,0.0116,5.496,4.1769,2.6617,5.7377,0.478,0.0173,5.3398,1.3918,0.6157,0.6754,1.2314,1.1173,0.0001,5.4176,4.7131,2.7416,3.3505,2.8182,0.2621,2.0414,1.0397,0.9416,4.4255,5.1694,0.1503,3.8274,1.1282,3.7553,0.1862,0.6183,2.5127,4.6863,4.495,1.5106,3.6099,1.6759,2.1861,4.2279,2.409,4.3518,3.06,0.106,3.0299,1.0165,3.9738,4.8627,1.4932,0.5555,5.5511,1.6892,3.6561,10.6161,4.74,3.7094,0.6616,4.2642,1.5391,3.5186,1.9954,2.1619,3.4114,4.0924,1.3908,5.785,1.3735,2.9343,1.9908,3.8467,1.602,0.727,5.9912,0.0636,0.0225,0.0041,2.8593,0.0392,0.0224,3.4469,2.1303,1.5573,0.5124,1.5873,3.261,3.2457,2.7253,1.0602,3.3556,1.6495,3.3689,2.8077,1.2867,0.5303,0.2307,0.0002,3.8101,0.448,1.1964,2.1315,0.6244,0.7751,0.5806,0.9999,1.5346,1.6849,0.7205,0.2055,0.3391,0.3614,0.7368,1.8617,2.005,2.2164,8.8993,5.6954,6.2369,0.0882,0.0,3.7754,2.2992,2.708,1.0223,4.4526,6.2124,1.2714,3.5111,6.3305,5.5114,3.0003,3.2839,1.7766,0.219,0.0717,5.1099,6.6957,0.2544,0.3512,5.9582,8.1205,4.4788,0.0926,1.2908,0.6988,0.025,0.0034,2.9299,1.731,2.3486,1.1184,0.4619,1.3118,0.565]}
{"id":2518,"ended":true,"length":619,"text":": After death, you can choose whatever afterlife you prefer. While you wait, you can hang out in living peoples'dreams. Your time is running out, but you're making great friends with a lucid dreamer.\n\n: Welcome to the new world.\n\n: First things first -- You can't leave the room. It's against the rules of time travel. You aren't supposed to.\n\n: But your soul gets a bit restless after some time. We need someone to be with you, and to share the experience with you.\n\n: Why are you here?\n\n: Let me explain. You and I are dreaming. And you've been waiting for this moment for a very long time.\n\n: I want to know. What is the meaning of death.\n\n: The meaning of death is to have an experience of one's own death. That is to say, to experience death while being conscious of it.\n\n: Why?\n\n: People get scared by death.\n\n: What's scary about dying?\n\n: People are afraid of dying because they can't find a purpose for existence in death.\n\n: What does having a purpose have to do with it?\n\n: Dying is a learning experience.\n\n: How so?\n\n: Dying shows the difference between life and death.\n\n: What is the difference?\n\n: That is to say, death is the lack of ability to live. It's a time when one is aware of the limits set on life, and knows that only death offers fulfillment. Death is a state of consciousness where one can't deny that life is limited.\n\n: What is the purpose of life?\n\n: The purpose of life is to live, and to live fully. People who know this find it easy to live.\n\n: What do you live for?\n\n: If we want to talk about living, I 'd like you to think of life less like a journey through time, and more like it's a constant experience.\n\n: What else do you live for?\n\n: For example -- The purpose of life in the next 24 hours may be to get a new job, or to see a show you've wanted to see for a while.\n\n: And in the next 24 hours, what else?\n\n: The purpose of life in the next 24 hours may be to meet your lover, or to write a poem, or to sing an opera.\n\n: And in the next 24 hours, in a still more general sense\n\n: That is to say, in the next 24 hours one must find a way to live full out.\n\nYes. You can live however you want. But the fact that you can live in many different ways is meaningless. It only has relevance in so far as a conscious individual seeks guidance as to how to live more fully.\n\nIn the next stage of this discussion you will be shown how to live more fully.\n\nYou'll be

{"id":940,"ended":false,"length":664,"text":"A Freshman in high school finds out he has the ability to control people's minds and ideas... but on the downside he is a lonely, misunderstood kid who can't control what he affects.\n\nCory, a 16 year old freshman, is a pretty normal guy, except that he's lonely and gets a bit of hate from others every once in awhile. He also has the ability to control the ideas and opinions of others, though it's not always a very good thing. He is a good and caring person, but he just can't seem to get attention from the girl he likes or the girl who sits on the same team as him.\n\nWhen Cory discovers a journal in his old locker at school he opens it only to find that his ideas and perceptions are being controlled by the mysterious 'JACK'.... And the only way to stop his mind from being controlled is to stop the control that is in it. Cory is a guy with a very strange problem.\n\nWhen I first read the summary that was given with this book I had to double take and check if I was reading right and I wasn't. Yes, it's true, Cory has a very strange problem indeed. But what I loved the most about this book was how well I could identify myself with this character. Yes, I have a bit of a strange problem at times, but nothing that compares to Cory's. While reading this book I could almost feel what Cory felt when he was reading the mind of everyone around him.\n\nYou see Cory is that kind-hearted, misunderstood guy who doesn't get any girl attention or respect. While that wouldn't be so bad if he didn't seem to care much, he really does care for people too much and it's so funny when you see the effects it has on everyone. While there are others who have issues with Cory, you learn that he can't help what he does, his mind controls him.\n\nWhen I finished the book, I wasn't quite sure whether to like it or dislike it. The ending was a bit of a shocker for me and for Cory, because he gets a bit of a bad name through out the book. However, while the ending was shocking and definitely didn't come off the way I was expecting (I was expecting happy ending with Cory and Jessica at the end, instead, we get Cory and Jackie at the end, which is cool and all, except you can't deny those chemistry in Jackie and Cory), you can't deny the fact that Cory changed for the betters. He learns to value people's opinions and the way he sees things.\n\nIf you like YA books with mind powers... or just a great book... This is definitely one to read! :)\n\nComments (2)\n\nI love how every book you recommend I end up picking up and loving. this one was a bit different because even though it is a YA, it has adult themes and mature content...like a rape\n\nit made the book very graphic, and the book was hard to read...but i wanted to know more about what happened...like who did it?...why did it happen?...and what happened after?...and the book was really fast paced and I didn't know how i was going to make it to the end...but I did and now i know where I am with my life

{"id":4868,"ended":true,"length":636,"text":"In a distant future, air on Earth is on short supply. Lay's chips bags become more valuable than ever.\n\nThe future is a land of chips. Not just a few kinds -- Lay's, Pringles, Doritos -- but dozens of flavors of chips, including, perhaps, one that tastes of steak. A lot of chips. Lots of different chip shapes. A lot of chips on the street.\n\nWelcome to the near-future in the United States.\n\nIt's a world where the supply of air keeps diminishing while demands rise due to climate refugees, pollution, and more.\n\nAnd it's all due to the efforts of The Biotransformation.\n\nThe company is controlled by billionaire businessman Jack Thompson, who is dedicated to bringing back the good old days of chips. He's a \"chips nacho\" guy more than anything else. And he is more than pleased that his company has been acquired by a British food company, Tommie Hobson, who wants his chips to \"be the greatest in the world.\"\n\nHow does lay's new chip taste like meat? Lay's steak frito\n\nAs fate would have it, Biotransformation has just learned that the United States government is in need of a chip manufacturer. Specifically, their country is facing a shortage of chips. Due to this lack, the government has ordered Biotransformation to make more of these chips.\n\nBut this chips aren't only of ordinary shapes and sizes. They've got a completely different flavor. It's the aroma and taste of beef.\n\nAnd it's exactly what the president of the United States of America wants. The president says that the chips will be able to help keep hungry people in this country from going hungry.\n\nTommie Hobson has agreed to the terms of the deal. He has promised to expand the factory. And he will do everything he can to make sure that Hobson's chips will be just that -- chips.\n\nAnd Lay's is so confident about their new chips that they call the product Lay's steak frito (although Thompson says he hates this name). No one knows quite what the chips will look like. The company is actually keeping that under wraps as well.\n\nThe chips will be produced at Hobson's factory in Detroit at first. He says, that while his current factory makes chips for other companies, he can manufacture chips for any company that wants those chips in a \"durable, rugged package.\" So far, he's received some interest from food giants such as Nestle, General Mills, and Pepsi.\n\nAnd who better to produce the chips than the owner of the very same factory? Hobson is convinced that Lay's chips will \"help people stay healthy\" and are \"perfect for a disaster.\"\n\nBut they are not the only big chip company expanding in Detroit.

You choose whether or not you would like to set the word count which dictates how long you have to talk to each character.\n\nI am the same as you. I have tried playing this game multiple times but the whole word-count thing makes me feel like time will be wasted because I could just talk to everyone until they die but that just sounds like a waste of time.\n\nIf you want to enjoy a game where the story and dialogs are good, but you don't want to waste time... I would recommend this game to you.\n\nVerdict : 8.5\/10","token_len":696,"entropy":[7.436,3.5312,1.7243,3.8867,6.5827,0.4011,3.0181,9.3638,2.9928,1.9699,4.8786,5.1517,4.0264,11.2017,0.5102,0.936,1.9475,2.2908,5.2315,0.2241,5.5258,0.9663,4.081,1.8548,5.0906,0.3727,3.0124,3.5678,2.5088,8.9561,7.4646,4.4165,7.3866,1.3912,10.3633,7.6878,8.4166,1.6719,0.2837,3.3243,4.1338,5.0008,0.014,7.3177,5.5009,3.2613,5.3551,7.2437,6.2618,2.6495,6.105,2.2499,2.242,8.8368,2.3398,3.9307,5.1672,2.7433,5.2159,1.8809,1.4348,3.3086,7.7197,4.8563,0.6442,8.4163,0.0004,1.3426,1.7016,1.4326,4.4674,4.4723,6.6133,3.4059,0.692,4.4965,4.8743,0.3618,2.0665,2.1084,1.1096,4.102,2.0996,6.5336,3.1088,5.5911,2.7353,1.847,7.7157,0.5473,3.7031,0.8041,2.0485,5.0155,6.4274,2.1494,4.121,1.8385,5.1947,3.946,0.9546,3.7833,0.0749,2.1076,2.9247,4.2259,7.019,1.7449,6.9887,1.588,3.1441,4.7177,1.9664,7.0984,8.5889,0.8725,1.8166,1.1968,0.8205,5.3626,1.7739,4.7629,1.0951,2.5239,0.0003,2.7942,1.1181,5.3253,8.3148,2.1116,1.3295,7.0112,2.0401,1.94,1.3535,3.4749,0.368,4.9299,0.7466,1.5013,2.0777,1.2776,0.0126,0.8896,4.6603,6.426,0.3702,3.392,6.4141,0.5608,1.6744,2.342,0.0073,2.102,6.0623,3.5794,4.6898,0.7489,2.2922,0.2634,1.5381,5.0515,0.499,7.5209,0.5084,3.4603,0.4753,4.9401,0.0928,3.0335,7.749,1.3317,5.745,0.5141,2.3822,0.2123,1.4038,4.9558,2.0144,6.1212,0.1778,1.8007,2.3342,0.6563,0.7911,4.1836,2.3837,6.68,1.1889,5.5418,0.3844,1.0225,0.4455,9.3891,3.095,0.2057,3.3774,2.4041,2.5754,1.2791,0.9998,0.6207,2.6162,5.5148,2.1862,7.3396,0.14,1.5114,0.7475,1.3016,1.5252,0.0002,1.5186,0.3377,2.5083,4.6532,1.7916,7.9057,2.3361,0.7283,5.154,0.9743,1.7447,0.5189,4.3152,1.5919,4.2522,2.5645,9.455,1.5608,0.6912,2.3673,5.4612,0.5728,0.1394,0.7115,8.3289,1.9485,0.6928,2.392,4.1757,2.6263,0.2683,0.8464,5.8211,0.7481,2.0328,7.8899,0.0888,3.8545,4.7718,4.3657,6.6459,4.2301,2.0159,1.2189,0.0003,2.6758,0.3407,4.0036,1.0299,1.556,1.2389,1.8526,0.0067,0.3894,5.6309,0.0373,2.4729,0.7475,3.6548,5.6246,3.2808,1.8198,1.1631,4.0613,5.3657,8.9898,4.3097,0.0004,5.8213,3.6538,0.1817,2.5846,0.0003,3.919,5.1796,1.273,3.7235,2.1602,1.4643,3.4165,0.894,0.5311,4.0307,4.2596,3.0097,0.4415,2.0083,2.7628,2.2317,3.7135,3.9946,3.8889,0.0083,5.4001,2.275,7.5664,0.067,3.2887,2.7985,7.9044,4.0139,0.5571,1.2865,0.0003,3.8841,6.842,2.9828,0.422,0.0003,2.8763,1.4478,3.7159,5.6995,6.5891,0.2674,3.1203,0.4973,3.7241,0.4864,1.9345,7.6901,2.5924,10.718,0.0856,2.3581,4.417,2.1638,0.2729,2.6854,0.5597,3.0038,0.9287,2.3233,1.4007,0.8374,3.3572,0.7437,0.9052,1.5183,2.7591,2.6394,4.4847,0.0274,3.1726,3.5707,0.022,0.2095,3.879,3.6149,0.4945,4.605,0.494,2.3497,4.5925,3.0445,1.0303,1.5252,0.0003,2.0402,2.8892,5.6579,0.1696,6.0401,0.9087,3.5345,5.3063,4.0913,1.7809,5.6166,1.8576,2.4099,0.5152,1.7918,0.0004,2.8228,1.0208,5.5073,2.4493,1.5296,3.1273,10.5376,5.9502,0.3846,0.8518,1.2001,2.6672,2.4191,0.1052,2.0275,4.3191,1.7908,4.3029,2.0728,2.5956,1.7771,0.5927,4.456,0.7751,2.9676,3.6417,7.2834,2.5026,0.145,0.2679,3.6426,0.4067,3.1054,4.4535,1.1093,4.4375,2.6263,1.0054,0.6774,8.5436,0.3762,2.9571,4.6631,1.0255,0.2662,1.223,0.9785,0.4079,0.2887,2.0344,0.4921,0.8606,0.0003,9.0404,1.2121,0.433,0.0002,7.2475,3.2752,5.0342,0.0844,0.1291,0.0136,0.0163,0.1291,0.168,1.8706,3.6585,4.9535,2.2043,0.0031,0.8518,4.9065,0.3865,0.1114,6.9118,2.0624,0.8179,0.0341,7.0813,6.2966,0.8044,0.2402,0.1999,1.5633,0.0337,0.4712,0.4246,0.0944,0.9369,0.2554,0.4641,0.0003,8.6204,3.5384,0.6529,9.8987,1.1535,6.6891,3.4848,0.0002,3.9119,9.3634,3.6982,1.4254,5.0169,5.3096,1.6364,5.5248,1.4252,3.0993,10.3991,0.6713,0.9545,7.0975,0.3897,0.1991,0.7846,0.0003,1.1005,0.0414,0.1129,0.0003,6.1864,3.1374,2.0459,2.5653,0.896,3.9975,4.0831,0.0465,0.0234,0.0081,0.0071,0.147,0.1527,0.6754,0.6121,0.2552,0.0085,0.0019,0.0171,0.0526,0.0063,0.0096,0.1463,0.0051,0.0243,0.0008,0.0182,0.0123,0.0125,0.0016,0.0037,0.0618,0.001,0.011,0.0032,0.0023,0.0166,0.0237,6.8312,1.4731,0.0407,0.0167,0.0552,0.0251,0.0051,0.0063,0.0024,0.0003,0.0357,0.0008,0.0005,0.0007,0.0023,0.0016,2.5696,0.5996,0.1901,1.4773,0.0055,0.0008,0.0022,0.0037,0.0271,0.0045,0.3417,0.0674,0.0754,0.0008,0.0023,0.001,0.0019,0.002,0.0009,0.0063,0.0015,0.0022,0.0007,0.0011,0.0044,0.0073,0.0004,0.0025,0.0091,0.0008,0.003,0.001,0.0018,0.0036,0.0377,1.7591,0.0002,5.0176,3.4699,4.3671,4.826,1.5571,1.1027,1.2508,1.5471,2.3564,5.7098,6.6502,2.6408,0.137,5.2067,0.0098,2.9929,3.2202,7.0041,10.3525,5.7849,0.3409,0.7491,3.4773,0.834,1.7965,0.7687,9.2717,5.388,2.7799,1.5426,4.2248,0.845,4.9449,3.2476,3.7494,0.5601,3.3165,5.4906,1.5764,1.8277,5.1143,3.023,4.4956,4.2679,1.4476,1.2937,2.0606,0.3812,0.2213,0.3137,0.9041,0.0002,3.6317,0.2592,2.0187,0.4304,4.7881,3.7059,1.8888,3.6194,2.2373,3.4832,3.1941,4.4145,1.0475,0.5223,4.4409,1.3387,3.2922,2.137,1.9484,0.0016,0.9958,0.1751,3.9268,0.4738,6.6884,2.7568,1.6228,0.7837,2.1135,0.2771,1.7879,1.2093,0.5439,0.8279,0.0005,5.4491,0.1201,0.2596,4.9372,1.7349,0.287,0.6048,0.0164]}
{"id":4613,"ended":false,"length":627,"text":"( WP ) We've been through worse...\n\nThe Daily Telegraph, Sydney, April 23, 2007\n\nIT WAS an extraordinary, and utterly predictable, performance from the NSW Blues.\n\nThere have been much, much worse than their 26-14 loss to the Wallabies in Sydney this morning; the worst defeat since 1985 against the All Blacks; the first time they have lost to the tourists at this level.\n\nIt was also the first time they have lost back to back Tests in their home State in 37 years.\n\nBut none of that means the players should be allowed to rest on their laurels because the Wallabies will be on to them just as quickly as the referee is off his backside.\n\nThey won the Bledisloe last season and the coach, Robbie Deans, is in no doubt the tourists can do that again in 2007.\n\n\"There was a very similar vibe about us last year,\" he said.\n\n\"We were in a good place and then it just all started to go pear-shaped.\n\n\"Hopefully we can learn the lessons from last year and not make the same mistakes this year.\n\n\"We were in a really good place last year. We would have been confident going into the Wallabies game, but there is a huge gulf between confidence and ability.\n\n\"That's the sort of gap we need to bridge between now and the end of the year.\"\n\nWhat the Blues also need to bridge is their narrow win-loss record against the Wallabies at this level.\n\nIn the last 14 matches since the mid-1970s, the Blues have won just 15 and lost 13.\n\n\"Historically it has been the Blues' Achilles heel against the Wallabies,\" Deans said. \"It's nothing against the Blues. We just keep getting on top of them.\"\n\nAnd Deans is hoping that just maybe, this might be the year the Wallabies can do it against the Blues.\n\n\"We haven't won as many as we would have liked against the Blues, but what's happened is the Blues have beaten us plenty so it's actually more like a draw,\" he said.\n\n\"So on that basis I'd like to think we could win the next three.\"\n\nBut the biggest difference since the mid-1970s is the Wallabies' victory over the All Blacks in a dramatic series in 2002, so how do the Blues stop Deans' men?\n\n\"The first thing is making sure the set-piece doesn't get beaten up,\" Deans said.\n\n\"Our scrum was pretty good in Auckland three weeks ago and then we were beaten the other night.\n\n\"Obviously with a bit of rain about the scrum isn't going to be anywhere near as good a place as it traditionally is.\n\n\"So we've got to stop that from happening. You also need to make sure you're physical enough, and the Blues are a big, physical side.\n\n\"We need to be smart like we were the other night, which means putting as much pressure on their ball as they are on ours.\n\n\"I don't think they played that well in Brisbane (in Round 5 and 6).\n\n\"They got away with one win and they were well beaten last night. So we've just got to make sure we don't let them off the hook.\"","token_len":702,"entropy":[12.9358,5.0822,10.3201,3.6985,2.9862,5.1741,6.8576,6.4621,2.0047,0.0429,3.5843,6.5925,3.7353,3.5519,7.9385,2.5874,3.9456,3.4212,0.39,3.5716,1.2073,0.0003,7.289,1.6318,3.8139,3.7662,3.6466,4.5517,5.245,5.6539,0.5131,5.0874,1.5933,1.5789,4.4691,5.7406,1.5782,1.3255,0.0002,4.5911,3.7368,0.1439,6.3139,4.0544,0.4987,0.9304,3.8264,5.2178,8.1378,0.4256,3.7132,1.3215,0.5034,1.0043,6.1404,0.009,1.3327,2.5397,3.3337,3.3648,5.6075,2.3183,6.0343,3.6712,3.0787,6.0855,4.0934,0.6385,3.988,0.0064,3.959,1.2346,3.3505,2.1822,1.893,1.763,1.258,2.808,1.2746,9.2537,3.2995,4.4176,1.252,1.4609,0.2908,0.0002,2.6939,0.8783,3.2858,1.3769,1.1451,0.462,1.5309,1.2757,1.1142,4.8562,1.6295,0.3673,3.7843,1.9825,2.1218,3.524,6.4117,2.7172,5.8691,0.1457,0.6995,0.4515,0.0002,3.1733,6.0262,0.1205,1.1742,4.5418,1.9531,5.0499,4.2506,0.8222,3.6248,0.0858,4.3496,2.2093,0.7415,0.0436,0.0001,5.6908,2.1557,4.2588,0.0074,2.9079,1.6693,4.3623,6.2775,5.1411,6.6278,0.6631,3.6257,0.4678,1.8529,8.3619,3.5805,6.2375,1.8194,3.414,5.225,0.4688,0.1849,0.0001,3.1725,4.0162,3.0122,7.972,1.51,0.0173,0.0003,6.5533,3.6167,1.788,2.6144,6.7421,2.7796,5.8797,5.3981,0.0168,0.0892,2.246,3.7027,2.9313,0.6404,2.9383,13.7041,5.1736,3.1988,3.6005,3.7422,3.0713,6.6377,0.7338,0.1911,0.0001,3.9569,3.4585,2.4517,0.9572,3.8576,5.3061,5.878,4.3047,3.6953,2.4618,0.5399,1.2355,2.6194,0.3543,0.3299,0.3575,0.0003,0.1227,1.1472,1.8634,3.3902,1.2655,2.4175,1.4282,2.0386,4.1702,2.7041,3.2805,6.3495,3.1875,0.3103,2.8103,4.5209,0.7647,0.0071,0.7801,0.4618,0.0001,0.0348,5.8643,0.9717,0.5397,5.4912,4.9854,1.1182,1.0923,2.7515,0.1059,1.3334,4.6833,4.1929,1.8253,0.2898,0.2284,2.8446,0.2534,0.8642,0.2929,0.0001,0.0545,1.28,3.2115,2.7885,0.6465,3.7714,0.1889,0.488,2.2264,0.1624,1.8887,1.3925,5.72,0.9636,1.4916,6.8686,4.5793,0.1613,0.8797,7.0204,0.0722,2.346,2.2756,0.7123,3.6278,2.9581,1.2574,4.3481,4.264,0.6038,6.2231,0.3246,6.0618,0.9048,0.0569,0.0002,0.0555,3.5734,0.9087,2.3538,4.9471,0.001,4.5393,1.2655,1.4432,0.0566,5.4057,3.0124,3.56,0.067,1.5093,2.8097,0.0466,0.3806,0.8663,1.2348,0.1577,0.0002,5.3277,2.7731,2.5918,6.2888,0.9806,0.9533,6.8857,0.5178,3.3267,8.4353,3.9141,2.3241,0.4597,0.0653,1.8513,0.5616,2.5438,0.0027,2.7177,4.091,0.3694,0.6792,0.1835,0.0001,3.4017,1.7243,2.3145,4.8491,2.419,4.4285,1.4924,5.9978,0.1815,3.1778,0.0062,0.4332,1.0258,1.2694,0.279,1.8652,2.1284,4.5256,3.8991,0.3892,3.9311,0.6701,0.1145,0.0001,3.1324,9.5018,0.0112,2.9832,2.1621,0.229,2.6626,3.1421,3.2552,7.0749,0.8784,3.5695,0.424,0.6858,0.0044,0.6652,1.9066,0.0014,0.1202,0.0476,3.4918,2.1252,0.8327,6.6218,4.9613,0.693,4.8922,1.8497,2.7599,3.3239,5.8096,2.5825,5.2323,2.874,0.4692,1.677,2.1915,0.0136,0.0002,3.9214,4.2521,0.0011,2.3069,4.8144,2.1471,6.8126,5.9129,1.9653,3.6739,6.8166,0.6931,0.8113,2.7738,1.3023,2.7233,0.01,2.1562,3.6527,2.2319,6.184,0.6473,0.7279,0.9486,0.1453,0.0001,0.757,1.5341,4.212,0.0003,2.3227,5.6756,0.1498,3.5865,0.5507,2.395,2.1043,0.1498,3.4654,0.7425,2.2924,2.1161,0.8243,5.2338,3.19,2.486,1.117,2.4992,1.0985,0.3934,4.4151,0.969,8.2306,5.5181,3.0408,0.5049,6.7169,3.6097,3.7153,1.4103,4.3877,1.4141,0.1471,0.08,0.0173,0.0379,0.0002,0.2377,4.0897,6.3028,2.3072,2.046,2.59,3.1391,1.8573,0.2069,1.5502,0.8994,2.382,1.5439,1.8755,2.5913,2.3768,5.0321,0.4777,0.0002,3.6465,2.4399,5.3016,3.9865,6.9513,1.1081,1.1576,0.0589,0.1995,0.0003,1.0237,1.4045,3.2195,0.0099,1.8132,6.3509,1.3972,0.3155,1.0928,0.0082,1.4445,4.1272,6.9589,3.4401,2.5076,6.0428,2.5464,5.7619,4.8227,2.5401,1.4155,0.3395,5.8206,6.5584,0.0008,2.5458,5.9931,2.7506,0.0251,0.0001,0.9813,2.6509,3.3231,1.0272,2.048,6.1609,0.2872,2.1582,8.5318,0.6744,0.5455,4.1102,0.0005,1.6459,6.4817,2.4386,1.0893,1.5671,0.0013,0.0817,0.0288,0.0686,0.0002,0.0468,5.2119,6.6565,0.14,2.6479,3.0745,1.1025,2.4013,5.9602,6.5136,1.4335,0.055,1.3243,2.5867,1.3343,2.8453,3.6874,5.3159,2.5194,1.6997,2.4865,0.3407,0.0001,0.0206,5.2005,4.5393,2.3542,4.2943,0.2077,6.6818,8.6395,2.1966,5.7193,0.0581,7.9953,0.0002,1.6279,0.0146,1.5216,8.1606,0.3523,0.8829,0.6149,3.8864,2.8102,0.7519,0.8598,10.9823,0.4164,1.0653,0.178,0.0001,0.022,3.0954,1.1748,1.8011,0.2363,0.112,5.7165,1.9302,2.7598,0.1729,1.2152,4.9417,6.1882,1.4267,0.3634,1.8239,0.0247,2.0277,1.7134,8.6544,2.6724,3.2708,2.5381,3.2781,5.7283,1.2978,2.7802,3.0069,2.7157,1.6888,3.0035,1.2272,0.1694,0.0001,0.0377,1.6992,2.2226,0.3047,2.0097,5.5591,6.5617,1.2685,1.7913,4.0299,1.5505,0.912,2.0138,3.9609,3.0081,4.3846,6.1494,0.4681,1.3099,0.0734,4.6267,5.479,3.1712,2.8609,4.0218,0.9587,2.4529,0.7954,0.1806,0.0001,0.0408,3.1047,2.3251,0.0003,0.5835,2.0266,6.3207,3.6158,0.8435,2.0937,4.5911,4.921,2.676,5.6233,3.3848,4.4508,2.2864,1.983,0.664,0.0001,0.0258,2.1563,3.7039,4.011,0.9006,6.0019,4.9967,1.7129,2.4174,3.373,6.0169,2.0269,4.079,1.7185,1.1846,3.5649,1.3501,1.5088,4.9973,0.0626,0.0078,2.0278,0.0798,0.6156,2.607,0.0002,2.2966,1.0883,4.6136,0.6628,0.0332,0.9097]}
{"id":3770,"ended":true,"length":648,"text":"How I Survived The Zombie Outbreak\n\nThe first book I ever purchased was Night of the Living Dead. Then I watched the original movie, and it terrified me. My parents took off their wedding rings out of fear of what might happen. It was a very different time for us.\n\nI never thought I\u2019d see a zombie apocalypse. It\u2019s crazy how these stories don\u2019t make into the headlines, but yet we watch movies and play video games about them. I decided to put a twist on zombie apocalypse by making it something that I could actually survive. The zombies in Night of the Living Dead are only on screen as they are already dead. I wanted to see if I could survive a real outbreak.\n\nI got to work on the story, and I worked on it in many different ways. I\u2019d write in the small morning hours, which would last all day. I\u2019d write on my phone while I was with friends and family. I\u2019d write when I went to bed and work for a few hours and then sleep. I\u2019d go to sleep early so I could start working the next day.\n\nI really didn\u2019t have an outline. I just tried to imagine where my characters were at all times, and I figured out the story as I went along. I also had a lot of fun being able to do what I wanted in writing this story.\n\nYou can imagine my excitement when the zombie outbreak happened a few years later. I was right on my laptop again, furiously writing the story. I ended up getting into a little bit of trouble with my mom for staying too long at my computer so many nights.\n\nI\u2019m hoping to get the next one published sometime soon. When I do, I\u2019ll definitely let you know. Until then, happy reading.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nReagan Davis is a 21-year-old bookworm. She\u2019s in college studying English and History as well as minoring in film. Reagan enjoys writing, reading, and acting. She\u2019s working on her first screenplay and would love to direct a feature film. She enjoys movies such as Dawn of the Dead, The Walking Dead and the original Night of the Living Dead. Reagan also loves writing short stories and has written nine of them. She\u2019d like in the future for her writing to continue and see her published. In her free time, Reagan likes gaming, and you\u2019ll often find her playing Skyrim. On the rare occasions that she isn\u2019t gaming, she\u2019s writing short stories. Her two favorite authors are Steven King and Stephenie Meyer.\n\nLike this:\n\n3 thoughts on \u201cHow I Survived The Zombie Outbreak\u201d\n\nAww, it\u2019s nice to see how young authors are already inspired by zombies. Good luck with the writing. If you ever need anyone to review you novel (or help with the grammar), I\u2019d be more than happy to give your book a read and give you helpful tips.\n\nI\u2019m glad you enjoyed it. I want to make a big deal about the zombie situation in America, and how we don\u2019t talk about it enough. You\u2019d think it would be an all-time staple seeing the zombie shows and movies. Thanks for visiting and your comment. Have a great day.","token_len":707,"entropy":[4.2665,9.4633,0.0013,2.9633,5.5401,3.7633,2.0838,0.0151,2.675,2.3655,6.12,1.7909,2.0357,5.0578,0.6995,7.3415,1.9553,0.1944,0.6224,0.0889,1.3386,5.8739,0.8656,4.5917,1.6296,4.7779,2.3117,1.9492,2.1116,2.5615,7.6295,0.0601,0.7763,4.6004,2.8725,4.7158,5.0569,1.8514,7.0548,1.3508,7.3399,0.1579,6.8147,1.7851,2.9259,2.6511,0.1614,1.6165,3.3086,0.9694,2.0804,3.1565,3.7206,3.1175,2.8906,3.9569,0.7165,1.2011,0.0002,1.7712,4.4708,2.798,1.082,19.2591,6.4775,1.1632,4.4187,1.876,1.2386,2.9569,1.3259,2.7325,4.1133,0.5779,0.9802,4.9868,2.9937,4.8654,3.579,4.5322,0.3892,1.1011,0.1361,3.0125,9.1272,3.7254,5.6831,2.3257,0.9061,8.2999,3.0199,4.9853,2.9346,1.8265,4.8069,1.3044,0.0121,2.9375,4.0962,0.5405,2.2176,6.8538,0.486,4.6143,2.8784,6.3433,0.1396,6.3755,1.1917,2.5582,3.4983,3.0295,3.8415,1.5184,2.0224,1.6994,3.4106,4.044,0.6664,3.9124,3.4859,3.2797,2.0866,0.0389,0.0048,0.0014,0.0003,1.3782,5.8562,5.6952,4.6695,4.5272,2.3744,1.629,6.5404,1.7802,0.5337,2.3808,2.4032,0.4213,4.3352,2.0821,1.1927,0.0897,1.7266,3.3749,4.6914,6.3184,1.2547,0.6904,0.0002,1.5792,4.3514,2.1717,2.4737,0.9791,1.3338,3.1968,2.2426,0.9902,1.4773,4.6857,1.1834,1.9992,3.5626,5.8684,0.4352,0.1383,0.3044,0.9765,7.4113,0.3393,0.2713,4.1546,4.6958,2.1598,7.0172,8.6188,1.8333,1.2513,4.707,4.432,5.3883,5.0811,0.3173,1.0625,0.5524,1.731,0.0164,0.0233,2.1869,2.3537,2.2487,2.3255,3.1733,1.1489,1.4089,6.0189,2.6875,1.9553,1.8729,1.3201,0.2732,0.9297,0.0093,0.0123,1.7095,3.4505,0.4019,4.2614,0.5215,1.071,2.2097,6.692,4.9684,1.9994,2.1767,0.1332,3.3514,1.0021,3.8733,1.5949,0.4251,0.569,0.0055,0.009,3.8781,0.6867,1.5718,3.7782,4.0048,0.5014,1.6738,4.332,2.3996,4.1772,1.8018,0.1863,0.3641,1.5888,0.0002,1.0033,4.8611,3.2354,0.1487,0.1421,0.0172,2.7584,3.6759,5.9716,2.7341,0.5414,2.4942,4.527,0.2793,3.8208,4.4007,2.8232,3.8149,1.9944,3.8264,3.701,0.342,1.7447,1.0385,1.9401,5.4874,1.9786,2.8071,3.2692,4.393,0.8278,0.5318,0.2211,0.1044,1.0199,4.0053,3.1933,1.346,2.5188,0.0387,1.8518,6.524,2.0678,0.0012,3.1225,3.3606,0.0669,1.4942,3.7959,3.2684,3.0728,1.6316,0.3789,1.1736,0.0002,4.7733,1.9886,6.021,2.3401,1.1213,0.3872,3.026,2.5592,1.8935,3.0912,6.0769,0.5228,1.3103,2.7476,0.397,0.9928,1.796,6.4471,2.4965,2.894,6.0713,6.3152,1.2262,8.438,1.7813,1.8675,0.9054,0.6488,0.9618,6.8388,0.0227,3.1163,3.7344,0.9437,4.1272,1.6538,0.0447,1.2917,1.8264,1.3473,3.9149,3.2639,6.8232,4.6326,0.6883,2.4059,2.9966,3.8816,4.6989,7.3565,3.5679,0.4818,1.6037,0.0002,1.3053,3.8437,0.0152,5.4882,5.188,1.7097,2.3602,3.6535,3.9457,3.238,2.6826,3.6362,1.3782,0.385,5.3787,0.603,2.9864,0.6305,0.2638,2.9122,0.0361,1.7572,4.4377,5.5127,0.2178,0.3796,1.1964,5.2549,0.0983,0.115,6.006,2.6761,1.6376,0.3917,0.0003,5.0217,1.3314,0.1518,0.9688,0.0002,6.422,5.9876,6.5167,0.5182,0.61,6.758,0.6298,0.0109,0.2657,0.0019,6.7473,2.0186,2.1299,0.9734,5.724,0.5776,0.3343,5.213,3.6747,2.6296,3.5702,1.4831,4.6833,4.7221,1.2455,0.0324,10.84,1.0797,0.0304,5.1243,1.5345,4.6649,4.9495,2.6688,1.5789,2.8872,0.5777,0.4341,4.5025,0.4903,0.9891,2.9241,0.0278,0.0268,5.1789,0.9119,1.0227,1.9975,3.9765,2.2935,5.9785,1.167,0.1553,5.4343,1.9847,3.5323,0.5847,1.0056,1.6939,4.1556,4.6783,3.1221,0.0047,7.3139,0.059,0.0925,0.2026,0.6472,2.1613,2.5075,0.0002,3.2098,3.7098,4.8565,4.7575,0.0443,0.0067,0.0039,0.0006,0.2424,2.1197,2.933,2.0447,3.8345,5.2929,0.3368,1.1161,2.798,1.9711,5.2795,4.1926,1.3834,0.4217,1.541,2.7819,0.016,5.1229,3.0317,6.7978,2.3782,5.4613,4.6956,2.7282,4.7351,5.1021,3.4045,2.8097,4.2768,1.9732,7.0132,0.9247,5.2465,3.5655,3.1073,0.002,0.6413,2.7786,1.6663,7.2604,0.8768,3.9511,5.0237,3.9732,0.3623,0.3526,7.8403,0.983,0.1167,2.5522,6.6824,1.5394,6.1148,2.5334,6.2693,0.4272,1.6597,0.6087,5.1736,0.7871,0.1294,0.0767,4.3181,0.2612,0.3409,2.7045,0.0102,0.2239,3.2943,4.1586,0.2759,1.4912,3.6526,6.8253,1.1844,5.2654,0.3314,5.4246,4.3236,0.3877,4.1456,7.7863,0.0226,0.2587,1.5284,0.0003,4.8204,0.647,0.1308,13.6358,0.0006,7.0974,8.4426,0.3234,10.1782,5.9773,5.6437,2.1417,0.2067,0.0002,1.0084,0.0098,0.0017,2.4347,7.6538,0.5772,0.0003,5.1375,5.185,0.7884,3.1301,2.799,0.2968,0.0552,4.5886,0.4587,1.038,3.7533,7.366,5.3848,1.4138,7.7332,5.3439,0.417,2.3421,0.5497,6.2417,1.6262,1.4878,2.6095,4.6483,1.9296,3.9238,0.1484,4.2617,2.9778,6.9346,0.905,5.1217,3.3594,12.6705,5.7204,0.9164,6.9425,1.9853,2.1769,7.33,1.5724,3.0954,3.0085,0.1015,0.7958,1.8009,4.2586,0.0606,0.1481,0.0228,3.8147,3.5654,5.0904,0.3716,2.1073,2.996,3.5726,0.6923,8.5748,0.6535,1.0157,0.9983,0.0004,3.7827,2.3804,0.0254,2.2603,4.3513,0.928,2.636,2.4519,0.6069,1.7249,3.9986,0.2488,4.8617,3.0212,2.2383,2.84,2.1989,2.1147,2.9425,7.1551,1.8792,3.1967,2.1691,0.9604,2.8379,1.8175,3.4912,0.0414,0.2497,0.0558,4.0726,0.0895,0.4483,2.4664,0.3088,4.2862,2.2296,0.0516,4.3123,4.8395,2.2208,3.7036,0.5094,4.9687,5.8768,0.6484,1.2327,8.5181,10.333,3.498,2.9749,6.8534,1.845,0.2687,3.3307,5.7665,0.5461,5.2331,2.9891,5.6222,5.7215,2.055,5.8088,0.4693,0.693,0.6608,0.8921]}
{"id":1202,"ended":true,"length":675,"text":"A homeless man tells one lucky passerby the meaning of life, and wins the hearts of all those around.\nIt's a little late in the year for a rags-to-riches story, but that's exactly what one woman from Canada got when she met an embittered homeless man who decided to give up his home for 24 hours and tell people the meaning of life.\n\"I said to him, 'This is how I see it, if you'd like to come play.' That was his response,\" said Julie Beattie, who met the homeless man when she was doing the shopping in Calgary last month. \"I didn't understand who he was at first. He really spoke to you in his words and his mannerisms.\"\nJulie was shopping a few doors away from where the homeless man was standing with a pan in hand.\n\"He was in sort of a pensive, angry place, and then he approached me and I said, 'It's a pleasure to meet you. What can I do for you today?' He goes, 'This is my day off and I'm off work, have you ever done this before?'\" said Julie.\nNot only did he tell Julie where to take her shopping (thereby creating an hour of free time), but he took the chance to teach her about life.\nJulie writes, \"We spent a few hours together, and this man taught me many of the same lessons that my husband had to teach me at home. He shared the joys of a sunset and the beauty of the sky as well as the pains of loneliness.\"\nThen came the moment Julie says she will never forget: \"He had me hold up a piece of paper so that he could write the word 'joy' across half of it. He put about 20$ in my hand and said, 'Give this money to another homeless person and tell them it's a gift, then tell them that they're the best person to do the same for someone else.'\"\nJulie adds, \"The man was so generous and so humble. He said it wasn't his to give, and that it wasn't about him. He was passing his gift on and I was very touched by that.\"\nSo what did Julie do with her money after all that? She gave half to another homeless man and told the other half to an employee at Timmies, a place that had captured her in a previous trip to Canada. Julie writes, \"It brought tears to her eyes, and for good reason.\"\nJulie tells the tale about the homeless man in a post about her visit to Instagram, where she told his story with the hashtag #ThisIsHowISeeIt. Her post has racked up over 6,100 shares and more than 9,000 comments. She says the experience has opened her eyes in a very good way.\nAnd you can bet that she'll be back in Calgary in the future. You never know who you'll meet during an entire day off.\nFor many, a day spent with a homeless person is a scary thing... or simply an unfulfilling experience. However, this story is a reminder that they are people just like us.\nMaybe, you should consider talking to the homeless person that knocks on your door one day and ask them what you can do to help make their life just a little bit better instead of worrying about what might make your life \"difficult\". One of the greatest gifts we can give them is our time.","token_len":714,"entropy":[11.1646,0.995,6.7226,6.6347,8.8312,3.0621,0.0352,4.0562,7.9239,0.1253,0.8498,3.3919,1.7142,7.7968,2.0356,4.0049,0.3745,3.0715,2.5764,2.7037,4.7112,0.9915,12.6955,0.9574,1.6315,5.0365,4.3546,2.4061,0.235,3.1179,1.4048,3.1135,7.9459,4.7031,0.1938,0.0003,0.0016,0.0006,0.0006,1.5611,1.3472,0.4016,3.7843,0.8288,2.6864,0.1387,4.7255,3.7428,3.9341,5.5747,4.3233,1.3552,0.2177,4.1117,3.3683,6.5387,1.7895,0.0,1.4573,0.1583,1.7525,5.1237,0.23,2.6017,3.3057,0.9774,3.3751,2.379,9.5365,0.384,2.462,6.286,5.6504,3.37,2.6898,0.0237,0.2136,0.4596,0.2691,1.5082,1.006,4.3544,1.914,0.2361,0.7685,0.187,3.7825,0.3944,3.1329,1.4887,4.3723,1.7163,1.5157,4.2157,0.5956,4.7203,1.2815,0.4988,2.6834,6.0962,5.3724,4.2336,1.5929,3.1667,3.8286,0.844,1.2818,6.0954,5.7834,3.957,0.008,0.4918,1.2736,3.711,1.0972,1.0553,0.049,3.4873,0.249,0.2565,6.9248,4.4018,6.0955,2.0334,4.6454,3.7177,1.9971,0.1315,1.7166,1.7087,3.3,0.0005,4.2366,5.7307,0.387,0.0672,3.6839,0.5947,1.3305,1.585,5.1231,6.8034,0.753,5.3375,3.0216,3.1753,5.2264,1.8473,2.8955,4.7447,0.1248,1.7247,0.038,4.8892,0.0123,3.12,6.8679,5.244,2.5173,4.4695,2.1179,1.1317,2.1764,1.1167,1.1519,0.0355,1.2715,3.5788,3.6926,1.5919,7.6859,4.04,1.2269,1.3506,1.2468,0.7473,1.157,1.64,4.2059,9.8318,0.0109,0.522,5.9021,2.666,3.0282,4.4161,5.8757,1.4027,1.5218,3.6716,0.8489,6.1291,0.2663,0.5932,3.3189,1.9012,0.4567,0.0195,4.5719,0.1457,3.0267,6.5878,0.5228,0.8647,0.0352,2.0153,4.1042,3.1405,0.3898,0.5518,0.2418,0.0114,4.6925,0.4721,1.6266,6.9954,0.4496,0.0343,4.118,0.199,1.9895,5.2456,1.0741,2.6865,0.4522,1.226,5.8345,3.9181,2.7161,6.4276,1.9475,3.3566,2.9357,2.093,0.5981,1.3359,3.7161,1.6363,0.4704,0.3608,6.5858,2.3212,0.6926,2.7106,2.7415,2.3855,5.6759,1.1359,3.8758,0.5452,2.5536,5.2949,4.7964,5.669,5.6168,2.0779,5.3322,1.6077,2.7048,0.1734,2.0382,0.979,0.2731,4.946,2.9248,3.9805,0.1412,5.2467,0.074,1.7413,2.5382,2.3405,0.3999,3.3363,0.0022,7.3896,2.4094,0.2604,4.4466,3.7041,1.8564,1.6403,1.0619,2.7036,1.9159,1.2149,5.493,3.0165,4.8546,0.2329,4.7621,2.9805,0.2173,2.8403,2.4218,1.5744,4.2512,2.4394,2.4122,4.7786,1.7551,0.2,4.4608,1.2694,0.9118,1.4464,5.1818,2.171,3.0577,1.0212,0.504,3.4803,9.6814,1.7571,0.913,4.0523,0.0639,2.1678,4.6877,4.3938,1.049,0.1745,0.547,5.685,0.3426,4.6634,2.0628,0.132,6.1857,3.6244,0.4708,5.1745,4.2434,4.7981,0.883,4.7036,1.0798,0.434,2.7984,0.8944,1.6783,4.229,2.4209,4.2156,2.9173,1.7672,2.6542,0.0038,0.2563,4.4685,1.1399,1.4894,0.1988,2.4223,3.0594,3.3461,0.4135,6.613,0.6763,3.8655,8.3925,0.8566,0.7778,0.9134,1.5992,4.481,7.2541,3.1722,9.1859,1.5937,1.8366,4.0442,0.8971,1.4582,0.4114,0.0303,4.9989,3.2495,3.7475,0.2992,5.0943,1.1277,0.7993,2.2209,3.551,0.2384,3.2119,0.7411,2.3352,2.3763,2.7747,4.9188,2.6011,0.2854,2.0895,2.3965,2.5536,4.2009,2.8369,3.3599,2.5682,3.4859,3.3006,1.2815,1.6583,5.275,0.2287,0.9898,0.093,1.8805,0.0019,4.624,0.4491,0.0292,3.4081,2.3354,2.147,2.1945,3.1058,1.1311,2.063,4.6807,1.3361,0.7056,2.6156,3.9706,3.6879,0.0004,2.7528,8.0586,2.1813,1.2403,2.1748,1.8577,2.1163,2.4162,0.0003,4.3754,1.6441,1.2074,0.9775,1.7193,9.2741,3.2166,6.7763,1.2431,3.2011,2.4447,2.0194,5.4858,3.7646,1.092,1.5513,1.076,0.0924,4.096,2.3365,2.2517,1.1221,1.2744,3.0101,1.4013,1.1467,3.6215,2.461,1.7631,1.0177,1.9209,3.6152,7.402,1.2577,3.4559,0.1719,0.3834,2.1348,3.1984,3.4437,2.7806,1.8704,0.63,8.4204,5.6977,1.3869,8.2061,8.3333,5.5968,2.8898,1.0879,6.319,1.9365,3.5209,9.7489,1.6362,4.7525,1.7623,5.1588,5.8876,1.3664,1.6835,0.3832,4.0506,3.6995,0.3816,0.0612,3.321,6.9744,2.1044,0.194,3.1228,0.0167,1.7675,0.4953,5.4904,4.1134,0.3398,1.8473,0.1786,1.6959,0.002,4.3135,2.1162,3.2758,3.7978,1.9721,3.7777,0.0591,3.3898,2.4205,3.5282,4.2112,1.647,3.2908,0.5894,9.5787,1.6075,2.0223,0.338,4.661,4.3889,0.1512,4.7599,1.776,2.324,0.0949,6.298,1.0957,2.4194,10.3894,9.7433,4.8787,0.6468,4.9235,2.1228,2.0955,3.9513,0.0395,1.0314,3.7245,0.3247,3.9608,2.3845,1.1364,2.6083,0.0058,4.1284,0.0952,0.4479,2.1195,0.7539,3.131,2.1816,2.3665,4.1009,1.8615,4.2716,0.2528,0.1862,5.4689,1.2985,3.4935,5.2848,0.061,0.761,0.2993,4.8084,5.2182,0.9873,4.5096,1.4121,2.2696,1.7053,1.4342,2.4179,1.7217,3.3044,1.9654,1.121,3.346,0.8428,5.2466,5.233,0.0573,3.3999,2.8254,0.9998,0.3372,5.7279,4.2934,4.2017,1.0273,5.4254,0.7931,1.0786,4.2078,5.8752,1.1441,3.8787,2.1871,4.1959,2.0163,1.3573,0.2843,1.8002,1.0576,1.3403,8.3181,3.0338,7.0721,3.9865,6.5481,2.6303,3.9914,2.3446,0.3732,0.0003,2.0988,0.3335,4.704,0.0805,3.3232,2.1165,1.5911,2.4189,2.1017,0.7265,5.6566,1.9852,4.8292,6.4127,0.034,1.3444,1.0737,1.8335,6.0614,3.4181,2.9474,3.9997,3.2732,6.2858,0.2626,3.4548,0.7919,1.0407,3.8941,10.2433,0.5254,0.3523,0.0157,4.9929,0.2776,1.3385,2.7281,1.3811,1.9243,2.8962,2.9716,0.0686,1.0747,0.4277,4.8861,2.4511,1.7214,7.2457,0.1025,0.1451,1.8484,0.5088,5.8886,0.2584,3.8519,0.1797,2.3268,3.8327,5.3245,2.9237,0.4275,6.9564,4.9625,0.0047,2.3847,6.2471,2.0808,0.4314,5.2189,3.466,2.6114,1.0462,0.3433,3.6456,0.4268,3.2997,2.4167,0.9801]}
{"id":3483,"ended":true,"length":612,"text":"Rewrite the lyrics of a popular song that tells a story to the narrative \/vocabulary of John Watson ( Conan Doyle )'s final book The Final Mystery.\n\nIn our opinion, the story \" The Final Mystery \" is the best, final book by John W.\n\nJohn Waddington.\n\nIn \" The Final Mystery \", John Waddington describes the mystery of the great mystery of the universe.\n\nBut, if you think about, the title of the book tells that John Watson has to solve the mystery of the Universe.\n\nBut, if you think how Watson is a good logical detective who has a passion for solving mysteries, that means that the main plot and the sub themes of the book should all relate to mysteries.\n\n1.\n\nThe Great Mystery :\n\na.What is a Mystery? And what is the final mystery?\n\nb.What is the Great Mystery that is in the final book of John Waddington?\n\nWe believe that the Great Mystery of the book \" The Final Mystery \" is the question of what or who caused the final mystery, namely, the big bang.\n\nConsequently, we have come up with the following poem where we want to rewrite the lyrics for \" Great Mystery.\"\n\nIn our opinion, John Waddington is the first logical detective who tries to answer these questions.\n\nThe poem of our version of \" Great Mystery \u201d has been prepared by professional songwriters and composers.\n\nYou will hear our poem in the soundtrack of the book-turned-film of the same title.\n\nThere are 5 pages of the final poem of the book \" The Final Mystery\" you will find here.\n\nWhen you complete our last puzzle, you will be able to listen to the song from the book.\n\n2.\n\nSub-Theme: Mystery of the great mystery :\n\na.What caused the Big Bang?\n\nb.What caused matter?\n\nWe believe that to solve the mystery of the Great Mystery, you need to know the origins of the universe as well as the matter itself.\n\nIn our opinion, the sub theme \" Who or what created the Matter? \" should be given sufficient time as a sub theme.\n\nSo, it is essential to create an appropriate sub-theme.\n\nThus, we have a poem where we have answered the sub-theme \" What caused the Great Mystery? \"\n\nThis poem is our last poem.\n\n3.\n\nTheme of the Book \"The Final Mystery\" :\n\na. What makes the last mystery that is in the last book?\n\nWe believe that the most interesting point of the book \" The Final Mystery \" is that it talks about a mystery that is at the end of time.\n\nOur version of \" The last mystery \" is a poem which talks about such a mystery.\n\nWe hope our version has been an interesting exercise for you. You will take these lyrics and write them onto a sheet of paper.\n\nYou will take the final poem and try to find ways to use the language and the language-themes present in the \" The Final Mystery \" into a poem.\n\nYou will know that, as a poet, you create a new poem by taking parts and lines from a poem and creating another poem where those parts and lines belong together.\n\nThis is our last poem. We hope our final poem will be satisfactory to our

{"id":3520,"ended":false,"length":680,"text":"You just got fired, you're pretty sure your girlfriend is cheating on you, you're 75k in student loans debt, rent was due last week, and to top it all off? You're all out of beer. Oddly enough, you just got an email titled `` Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting : Very Hard. ''\n\nThe email is sent by a company called OpenBazaar, a decentralized peer to peer Internet market designed to get away from central hubs where transactions can be viewed by anyone, like eBay and Amazon. \"We believe there are benefits to be had with the elimination of the middleman and a reduction in the cost of trade, and we'd like to pursue those goals,\" said OpenBazaar CEO Brian Hoffman. The company aims to be an alternative to both Amazon and eBay, but as a distributed market place similar to Reddit and Slack. The company aims to have the system up and running in a beta environment as early as October. To try it out, you can download the software, but don't expect to see anything except a \"coming soon\" page for a little while. Even when OpenBazaar is operating and accepting transactions, it will be limited to those participating in the OpenBazaar network. The developers say there will be \"multiple nodes with varying storage capacity and security, each able to support their own clients. We will not be able to guarantee the uptime of any single node.\" So how exactly will you use the technology? The company says OpenBazaar is a marketplace focused on \"free, direct peer-to-peer interaction. Transactions on OpenBazaar will be public and peer-reviewed, while other aspects of the open protocol allow users to use the platform for many of the same activities that are typically expected from online transaction platforms.\" On that free-speech angle, a system like the one promised by OpenBazaar would theoretically allow for commerce to flourish, even though the transactions made on the network will be encrypted.\n\nThe first step towards a new economy?

It's not perfect, says the company...

{"id":572,"ended":false,"length":680,"text":"You just got fired, you're pretty sure your girlfriend is cheating on you, you're 75k in student loans debt, rent was due last week, and to top it all off? You're all out of beer. Oddly enough, you just got an email titled `` Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting : Very Hard. ''\n\nThe email is sent by a company called OpenBazaar, a decentralized peer to peer Internet market designed to get away from central hubs where transactions can be viewed by anyone, like eBay and Amazon. \"We believe there are benefits to be had with the elimination of the middleman and a reduction in the cost of trade, and we'd like to pursue those goals,\" said OpenBazaar CEO Brian Hoffman. The company aims to be an alternative to both Amazon and eBay, but as a distributed market place similar to Reddit and Slack. The company aims to have the system up and running in a beta environment as early as October. To try it out, you can download the software, but don't expect to see anything except a \"coming soon\" page for a little while. Even when OpenBazaar is operating and accepting transactions, it will be limited to those participating in the OpenBazaar network. The developers say there will be \"multiple nodes with varying storage capacity and security, each able to support their own clients. We will not be able to guarantee the uptime of any single node.\" So how exactly will you use the technology? The company says OpenBazaar is a marketplace focused on \"free, direct peer-to-peer interaction. Transactions on OpenBazaar will be public and peer-reviewed, while other aspects of the open protocol allow users to use the platform for many of the same activities that are typically expected from online transaction platforms.\" On that free-speech angle, a system like the one promised by OpenBazaar would theoretically allow for commerce to flourish, even though the transactions made on the network will be encrypted.\n\nThe first step towards a new economy?

{"id":376,"ended":false,"length":680,"text":"You just got fired, you're pretty sure your girlfriend is cheating on you, you're 75k in student loans debt, rent was due last week, and to top it all off? You're all out of beer. Oddly enough, you just got an email titled `` Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting : Very Hard. ''\n\nThe email is sent by a company called OpenBazaar, a decentralized peer to peer Internet market designed to get away from central hubs where transactions can be viewed by anyone, like eBay and Amazon. \"We believe there are benefits to be had with the elimination of the middleman and a reduction in the cost of trade, and we'd like to pursue those goals,\" said OpenBazaar CEO Brian Hoffman. The company aims to be an alternative to both Amazon and eBay, but as a distributed market place similar to Reddit and Slack. The company aims to have the system up and running in a beta environment as early as October. To try it out, you can download the software, but don't expect to see anything except a \"coming soon\" page for a little while. Even when OpenBazaar is operating and accepting transactions, it will be limited to those participating in the OpenBazaar network. The developers say there will be \"multiple nodes with varying storage capacity and security, each able to support their own clients. We will not be able to guarantee the uptime of any single node.\" So how exactly will you use the technology? The company says OpenBazaar is a marketplace focused on \"free, direct peer-to-peer interaction. Transactions on OpenBazaar will be public and peer-reviewed, while other aspects of the open protocol allow users to use the platform for many of the same activities that are typically expected from online transaction platforms.\" On that free-speech angle, a system like the one promised by OpenBazaar would theoretically allow for commerce to flourish, even though the transactions made on the network will be encrypted.\n\nThe first step towards a new economy?

{"id":2052,"ended":true,"length":655,"text":"Sunday Free Write : Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - The Modern Prometheus Edition!\n\nThe Modern Prometheus is proud to present another installment of the much anticipated Sunday Free Writes, a weekly event hosted by myself where a small group of us (typically including, if not limited to, the Modern Prometheus, The Mad Arab, and sometimes the Modern Prometheus\u2019s mom) attempt to write 1,250 words in a single sitting, in hopes of creating epic masterpieces of genius and beauty. If and when we write, we write one free-write at a time. Each one will be written before the others. The Modern Prometheus\u2019s last free-write was a rather epic success. With nearly 1,500 words written in one sitting, there was no way I was ready to face that much greatness again. And yet, when we agreed to come back and do it all over again and possibly even in a new medium, I knew there would have to be another free-write. So here we are again, ready to go again. As always, it\u2019s free-write Sunday and I\u2019m here to give you the opportunity to have a go at it; I\u2019m only the host, after all. It is not written as a challenge; it is simply a free-write where you can do almost whatever you want. Do you want to leave me a comment and ask a few questions? Are you bored, but also curious of the other free-writes which may be coming at some point in the future (like me) and would like to give it a whirl in between? Have at it! It\u2019s fun and you may surprise yourself (and hopefully me) by creating a piece of writing so good it will live on through eternity.\n\nDo what you want with the rules. I like the idea of using anything. I like free-writes for the chance to use anything, anything at all. I like the idea of telling stories, poems, whatever.\n\nI hope you do well in the next one. You are on a roll!\n\nPost navigation\n\n6 thoughts on \u201cSunday Free Write : Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - The Modern Prometheus Edition!\u201d\n\nSo you\u2019d rather write stories or poems at this level, instead of essays, articles and the sort?\nI\u2019d have thought after this you could do a whole book in a day, since you write so fast! Is that your ambition for your writing?\nYou must enjoy this work?\n\nAww, you\u2019re so sweet! You gave me a much needed hug there! :3\n\nThis is just how it is for now though. I don\u2019t have any concrete plans yet. I have about 5 stories kicking around the ol\u2019 noggin which I can\u2019t get anything out of because they aren\u2019t quite right yet, but they will be one day. In the meantime, they are the only thing I seem to be able to get my hands on and are all but buried in my head, so this may or may not be what is happening.\n\nThe writing is done for me.

{"id":3154,"ended":true,"length":663,"text":"Crippled by misery and sorrow, you cry out that you would give anything to bring him\/her back. Time slows and settles to a stop. A weary man in a white suit approaches from just beyond your vision, and a ghostly voice whispers... `` Then let's begin. ''\n\nThe man in the white suit appears. He holds a glass vessel -- an empty, yet complete, glass vessel, its surface a bright white. An amber-colored, liquid substance is poured through the beaker opening onto the marble floor. It spreads over the floor, running down the stone. You can't see who poured it, but you sense that this is no ordinary liquid.\n\nAs if on cue, footsteps step onto the marble slab -- footsteps that lead only to the liquid. Your eyes focus on the man in the white suit. What do you see? A man of middle age who is very nearly bald. He wears a white suit that has become a bit rumpled. His hands are bloodied. His head is bent forward, as if he's crying. And he is...\n\nIf you can bear to watch, you will see your own pain reflected -- in yourself. You will see yourself standing in a white room in a white house. With a white coffin in the middle of the room. Your eyes slowly close and your head falls toward the coffin...\n\nTime drifts back...\n\n... back to the early morning of an October day...\n\nYour mother is lying in bed, her hands trembling. She tells you that she can't go on. She wants to die. To end this nightmare of pain. But she can't. She tries to explain to you that your uncle has been killed by the police. He's been dead for eight hours. She begins to sob...\n\n... then stops...\n\nIt takes too long for her to tell you the rest. She goes on to describe his funeral as the most heartbreaking day of her life. She tells you that you can't understand what she's going through -- that you don't know what a parent does when her child is killed...\n\n... and then she tells you that in the next few days she will become a monster.\n\nThe room swirls to you, through the room, through the house. The bed in which you once slept. The room where you once cried when your father left. The room with the yellowish-green wallpaper, and a picture of a girl with long, golden brown hair -- the same girl who posed for the picture on the back in a red gown... the picture you gave to your mother on your sixth birthday...\n\nA sudden flash fills the room...\n\n... and the white room is no more...\n\n... there is only empty air.\n\nYou stare at the man in the white suit as he stands beside you. You realize that this isn't happening... that you are a dreamer. You see the empty bottle of liquid... and you can still hear the gentle tinkling of the silver chimes.

You have to defeat the evil forces that have taken over the town and claim the control of the town back.\n\nThe good thing is that you can also recruit other heroes, so if one of you wants to be a good guy, you can always recruit the villians to follow you.\n\nThe bad thing is, if you defeat the bad guys, don\u2019t forget to take a look if they also have an evil lair\u2026\n\nYou can choose to turn into a super hero or villan if you like. Your superhero team will have 3 main members: 1 leader, 1 protector and 1 thief.

You can tap on an item as well to buy it.\n\nYou can also change your character or you can use the arrow keys to scroll through all the options on a character.\n\nThe game is quite basic, almost empty, but for only $1.49, maybe it\u2019s not a huge deal that there is no background music and no sounds.\n\nHow to Play The Town Hero?\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the screen will be empty and you have only some buttons at the bottom of the screen. The first is the hero\u2019s shield sign as well as the hero\u2019s name.\n\nAfter that, you can\u2019t click on the hero, it\u2019s a mouse button click.\n\nNext, if you don\u2019t tap on the hero\u2019s arrow, he will go to the hero\u2019s shield at the bottom. Now, you can click on the hero\u2019s arrow so he can move and attack.\n\nFor the arrows, you can tap on it four times to create an arrow pointing at the hero, three times will make him move backwards and four times will make him move backwards forwards.\n\nSo that\u2019s in a nutshell what The Town Hero is.

{"id":3673,"ended":false,"length":633,"text":"You have decided to give up... not on your relationship, but on yourself. You've given into the \"I-have-nothing-to-live-for\" mentality. There are so many things you can do that you don't realize now \u2013 like taking care of yourself and those you love \u2013 that you could be doing to improve your life, if only you were aware of them and set aside time to do them.\n\nIf and when you decide to re-commit to yourself, you will be inspired to pursue your dreams and set out to accomplish your goals. You will become the strong and confident leader you know deep down within to be. You may even be willing to stand up for others, as you would like them to do for you.\n\nThe \"I-Have-Nothing-To-Live-For\" Mentality\n\nYou have lost sight of your dreams and what you want. You have allowed life's burdens and responsibilities to consume you. You have become so preoccupied or pre-occupied with the daily grind and to-do list that you have neglected the small, simple and meaningful things in your life that bring you joy. You feel trapped. You feel like a victim. A victim of life. You hate going through the motions. You hate having to do things that bring you out of your comfort zone because you are afraid of failing. You hate working for others for reasons of self-preservation. You've become dependent on your partner, and your life has become an all-or-nothing situation. You have no time to yourself.\n\nThe key to getting out of the \"I-Have-Nothing-To-Live-For\" mentality is simply beginning to take back the control you have given to others in the first place.\n\nStart by identifying what it is that you want and what you want to see in your life.\n\nGet a piece of paper.\n\nBegin with the first thought that pops into your mind. Then start writing down all the dreams you can think of.\n\nHere are some things you might want to write down:\n\nWhat do you want out of life?\n\nWhat are you passionate about?\n\nWhat do you love about your current job or work situation?\n\nWhat do you want to accomplish by a certain age?\n\nWho or what have been preventing you from living the way you want in life?\n\nDo you want to see your parents enjoy retirement and your children become financially independent or financially stable?\n\nWhat about the children you plan to have? How about the grandchildren?\n\nHow can you begin to make your desired future a reality?\n\nHere are some questions to ask yourself:\n\nHow do you want to define success in the future?\n\nWhat do you want to accomplish?\n\nWhom and what do you want to surround yourself with?\n\nWhat can you do to make your current life better?\n\nWhat about starting the process of achieving your dreams...?\n\nWhat is your next step?\n\nYou know you want to stop putting off \"your plans.\" You know you are ready to start taking charge of your life and start taking steps towards the things that make you happy.\n\nIt's time to commit to you.\n\nStop putting off \"your plans\" and instead, start setting firm dates for your actions to begin.

{"id":1836,"ended":true,"length":672,"text":"Pick a song. Those lyrics are now known as `` the ancient prophecy ''. Tell the story of this prophecy's fulfillment.\n\nThe second part is to interpret it. What does the ``ancient prophecy '' mean to you personally? Interpret it on your own or as a class in a creative, interesting way\n\nFor the first part of this song, pick an old folk song. Write out all the words on the board and discuss it with your class. You can also sing this song. Write out the words to this song on the board along with some of the words for the ancient prophecy. What is the old folk song about? (i.e. the song that had the words `` and the ancient prophecy '' as its last line )\n\nNow for the prophecy part - think of three good old tales that have good moral lessons. Read each one out loud to your class, and discuss it. Then pick one ( and write it in big red letters on the board ) and interpret it creatively.\n\nWhen I was a little girl... I wanted to go to Heaven when I died... But first I wanted to be sure and I said... `` please show me how the world goes\n\n`` How does the world go? How does the world go? How does the world go? `` ( repeat this 2-3 times )\n\n`` The answers were simple at first, `` I know `` said the old soul... `` but I still wanted to know... ``\n\n`` And then the old woman showed us... ``\n\nYou can also illustrate both parts- (a few) illustrations (as long as the page is large enough ) can illustrate both the story of the ancient prophecy and the interpretation of the ancient prophecy.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nTeacher Notes\n\nAsk your students to write down what they see as the major characteristics of the prophet, Abraham (as you interpret the ancient prophecy through these characterisitcs )\n\nHave a parent or student interpret the prophecy - then ask to do the same for the character of Abraham. Ask them to identify similar characteristics which may be shared among the prophet, Abraham and the Abrahamic God. (i.e. love for humanity, the desire for purity and holiness, justice, loyalty, humility).\n\nAsk students to draw a map of the world at the level they see, including the land and sea surrounding it. Then have the students look at Abraham and draw a map of those lands in a similar style - with the land and sea surrounding them. They should include the lands he knew or visited and the lands known by the other cultures. Explain that this is a map of the world that God showed Abraham...\n\nI will lead the way, with you beside me; and we shall enter a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\n3 thoughts on \u201cWrite the history. Pick an old folk tale. Have kids interpret and write the meaning of the ancient prophecy.\u201d\n\nHi there! You are awesome! Your site is super simple, quick & clear. I love how you make the students do their math with the numbers 1-10, and the student will say which number they need to multiply or divide.

{"id":160,"ended":false,"length":677,"text":"Due to a crossed line a customer support worker has to deal with a hostage situation. Meanwhile a hostage negotiator has to deal with a disgruntled customer.\n\nThe customer is a former soldier who doesn\u2019t much appreciate life in the modern world and is intent on causing trouble while a colleague attempts to talk him down while another customer intervenes as well.\n\nI did quite a lot of police work over the course of my career but never got to fire a weapon, so it was great fun to get this set. It came with plastic handcuffs, a metal and plastic baton, a metal flashlight and a metal flashlight holder as well.\n\nSo the set is from 2010 and is the UK set. It\u2019s called Special Forces: The British Army. It consists of five figures, one in his standard khaki uniform, one in jungle-camouflage, one soldier in full-battle-dress and two in police dress.\n\nI had ordered it in May this year but unfortunately there were some delay with the delivery. The delay was due to the customs officers who tried to confiscate my order, or so they said. The reason why I had to wait so long was because of the Brexit, as I had to wait for them to decide whether or not to accept my goods in France. I had to spend quite a bit of time chasing my order because at first they refused to acknowledge my emails. I had to resort to going through other channels to obtain information and it was almost six weeks after I placed my order before they would talk to me.\n\nOnce I eventually got all the information, they were very quick to send the package.\n\nAll the pieces are reasonably large and nicely detailed and the figures seem sturdy too. They also come with two head and body armour sets, two arms with weapons mounted on the left arm, two pistol holsters and a rifle accessory. There were no bags, but there were quite a lot of accessories.\n\nThe figures all have removable weapons. I\u2019m not convinced about the plastic handcuffs though, I think I need to get something a bit more durable. So far one of them has broken. Also, most of the pieces don\u2019t seem to fit well. However, the quality is pretty good and I\u2019m very pleased with the final result. One of the figures got stuck in the head at first, but I guess that could happen to anybody. In any case it turned out OK after some glue.\n\nI did not take a pic of the jungle camoufleur and the police agent in police dress, as for most of the rest of the pics the lighting didn\u2019t really work out.\n\nFinally, here some more close-up pics:\n\nThis is how one of the plastic handcuffs looks:\n\nAnd here are the other two pieces with the plastic handcuffs:\n\nIn the pic below the green-turbaned guy\u2019s head is off. You can see how well it fits in the body. You also see that the plastic handcuffs are plastic, they aren\u2019t removable (or so I\u2019ve been told).\n\nHere is another pic of the police officer which you cannot really see well, but anyway you can make out the head quite well. His body is about 5mm, the rest is about 10-15 and the head is about 3-4 (though I think that\u2019s a lot for a head).\n\nAgain the head doesn\u2019t fit well in the body, but it\u2019s OK.\n\nSo let

{"id":2003,"ended":true,"length":698,"text":"Three years after the initial zombie outbreak a cure has finally been discovered to reverse the effects of the outbreak on your loved ones, who have been kept contained. The results are quite what was anticipated.\n\nThe cure is a vaccine that can be administered to a loved one who has contracted the virus and reversed the effects, effectively eliminating the infection from their system. The vaccine, once administered is only effective for those infected for a period of 5 years. After the cure is given the survivor must wait for 5 years for a second dose of the vaccine, in the event that their loved one is infected with the virus again and must be vaccinated once again. That means if you only vaccinated two years ago only one dose of the vaccine had been given but the surviving loved one will be fully protected. Once again the only way to recover your loved ones is to take them off the island and to a third off-world site to treat them.\n\nThe virus itself has also changed quite considerably in the past 3 years, and is now in the form of both a blood borne and airborne virus, meaning that any zombie outbreak would be an airborne one. The virus in it's airborne form, or in laymen's terms, \"H1N1\" can attack and infect the human brain as well as the lungs.\n\nHow the virus is transmitted\n\nThe virus can be transmitted via airborne (i.e. coughing ) or through the contact of bodily fluids through intercourse or other close contact. It's a virus that can be airborne and still spread through touch, this could be for many of the same reasons that you could contract influenza from a relative who has that virus, even if they are no longer infected.\n\nThere are also many other ways that H1N1 can spread, such as direct contact with blood or bodily fluids (through bites too! ), through coughing, sneezing, talking, or any other form of body contact.\n\nIt's not known right now the rate of infection rate of H1N1, but it is now a form of airborne disease. There hasn't been reported a death from H1N1 as of yet, but there have been several who have been hospitalized, however most of those have recovered.\n\nWhat you can do to protect yourself\n\nThe virus itself is not actually that fast and deadly as other things in the walking dead ( such as the Walking Arm or the Walking Dead Virus ).\n\nHowever because of the current condition of the world, an outbreak of this virus should not be brushed off as a harmless annoyance.\n\nPreventing the spread of Ebola in your area should be your main concern for now. However here's a few more tips about the virus and it's transmission :\n\nYou probably already know this, but the best way to prevent it is to keep yourself clean by washing your hands frequently ( especially after coughing or sneezing or coming in contact with bodily fluids through the above means ). Other than that a good old fashion alcohol cleanser such as Simple Green soap and hot water will also do.\n\nIf you have contact with either H1N1 or the walking dead virus (or any infection for that matter ) you should report it to the local authorities and your doctor.\n\nFor now that is all that is available on this very interesting virus, I know that I will be keeping an eye on what is to be

{"id":2707,"ended":true,"length":691,"text":"Workshop Q & A # 12\n\nThe second part of yesterday\u2019s Q&A session was focused on the next steps to creating the community, and the first two questions asked about the time frame, and how it will be built. I have a feeling this question will be debated over the course of the next couple weeks. I will leave it at that, but there are two points that make sense to make.\n1. Once the community is created, once we have all the rules established and we have a core of players who are willing to help others, it will probably take about two years for it to grow to a size where it really begins to have an impact on the game as a whole. That might sound like a long time, but I think it is realistic to think that we could have at least 8 million subscribers by then.\n2. At this point, if there were 50,000 active players, that would still be an incredible impact on the game. Once again, let me know if you have any suggestions, opinions and concerns for the next update and I\u2019ll keep it in mind.\n\nLike this:\n\nLikeLoading...\n\nRelated\n\n1 Response to \u201cWorkshop Q & A # 12\u201d\n\nI actually agree with you 100% on your time frame. If you want to see how many subscribers an offline game could have, you just compare EVE Online to World of Warcraft. EVE has about 2 million and WoW has 8 million. That means the average EVE player spends about 20 hours per month online and the average WoW player spends about 30.\n\nI also think you\u2019ll need a LOT of money if you want to keep the game free from all expansions. I think a good plan for the first year or two would be to start out with free \u201cprogression\u201d (unlocks) for basic weapons and ammo. Basic weapons might start out at a tier 3 and ammo could start off at tier 10 in the same way that tiers are now (although with a little less customization allowed). You\u2019ll still need some new content at regular intervals (3 months maybe?) and you\u2019ll probably still need to charge for it. I\u2019d suggest starting at about 6 dollars a month per sub. This will build slowly up to an expected $14 per month per sub for a year or so in a way that won\u2019t drive you completely insane. At that rate, it\u2019ll probably take you about 3 years to pay off the $300,000,000 initial investment. But then you can get serious about making expansion content and it should be fine\u2026.assuming you can raise the monthly fee to an expected $20 per month per sub.\n\nI also agree with your thoughts about paying for expansion content. That\u2019s easy enough. Just let us \u201cpledge\u201d money in order to get bonus unlocks. At the end of the pledge period the additional content will (or should) have a cost attached to it and we\u2019ll be able to decide if that\u2019s worth what we pledged towards. I would suggest starting at 10 or 12 dollars, figuring about 5 or 6 dollars per month per pledge. You could also do a \u201csuper sub\u201d that gives access to any extra expansions and additional unlocks at once for $20 a month.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to the future of RO2\n\nI know I\u2019m repeating myself, but you may want to look into the statistics for EVE.

{"id":188,"ended":true,"length":688,"text":"It has been six months since you first teleported and you have been able to control it for three months. You haven't told anyone, and yet you get a bad feeling about that man who has followed you to work for the past week...\n\nThe book is intended to be used as a supplement to the game Dungeons and Dragons, Fourth Edition, and it will provide details about two cities, their cultures, histories, and society in their world of Faer\u00fbn. It will also contain rules for character creation, races and classes, equipment lists, monster statistics, and skills, as well as some brief advice.\n\nSet during the late Dark Ages and early Middle Ages, when Celtic Celtic tribes were making their way across the continent of Faer\u00fbn, the adventure The Lost Druid\u2019s Trail describes a quest for a lost Druid who was last seen in the town of Bawn. The Druid goes on to a magical place, the Temple of the Great Bear, where the PCs have to face off against various obstacles.\n\nA young Druid is lost in the woods, and a traveler looking for water picks him up. They meet a tribe of Druids that are trying to escape a horde of goblin warriors, and they learn of a secret that could destroy the empire.\n\nCelts are legendary heroes and heroes never die; however, this is only the beginning of their tale in D & D. The druids of their day were more than just healers or mystics. They were warriors that fought with honor and passion, and now they are immortalized in this book...\n\nSet in the late Second Age, when the continent of Faer\u00fbn was still young and the Gods ruled over a vast realm of magic, the adventure Faer\u00fbnian Myth and the Lost Druid explores the adventures of the three gods that guided the world of Faer\u00fbn in this ancient age.\n\nThis is the beginning of a new series. This book is set in the Lost Ages and is designed to be an introduction to the culture of the time for the beginning players of the game. It will be followed by more complex books that will go into more detail about the character creation and other aspects of the period.\n\nA group trying to save a city from ruin encounters many challenges as they try to accomplish this. Set amidst the Great Sea, in an ancient age and in an ancient land, it is a great story about hope.\n\nThis book provides a new level of detail and complexity to the character creation rules, which will allow the DM and players of both the first and second edition of the game to have greater control over the game they are playing. It should also prove very useful for the intermediate players and DMs trying to explain the different aspects and nuances of the D&D experience to new players.\n\nThis book will provide more detail about how magic is used by adventurers and the world of Faer\u00fbn as a whole. It will also teach the reader what the gods do in this world and will be useful to the players and DM as a whole.\n\nThis book serves as a kind of overview for the D&D world, presenting a quick guide to the major nations (or regions) of Faer\u00fbn and what resources they produce, and the magic-users which dwell within them.

{"id":4993,"ended":false,"length":692,"text":"Kitchen Stories...\n\nThe kitchen is the heart of any home, and a beautiful space to cook, dine and entertain. It should reflect your personality and have an attractive feel-good, cozy atmosphere. Some people may be lucky enough to have a spacious kitchen with enough worktop space to accommodate many culinary creations. For others, however, it may be more difficult to get this outcome.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to consider every element of your kitchen before embarking on any renovation. This will give you an idea of the size of your space, what kind of features you and perhaps your family will use on a day to day basis, what layout you\u2019ll require, as well as any extra space you may need to store everyday items.\n\nThink about where your kitchen cabinets will be placed, and whether any will be open shelving where you can place large food items. This can be helpful for those with limited storage space, or those who like to keep their kitchen surfaces uncluttered.\n\nWhen it comes to the floor and walls of the space, have a think about how much storage you may want. A splash of personality is what many people need to make their home an oasis, and a large dining table or kitchen island fitted with a built-in storage area will help create this look and feel of \u2018home\u2019.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve determined where you want your kitchen to become at home, and what features are important to you, it\u2019s time to look at renovating the space.\n\nA kitchen is the perfect place to consider making dramatic changes, such as painting the walls a soothing colour, covering the floor with carpets and creating a dramatic focal point in the room with some beautiful stonework or cabinetry.\n\nFor those of you with limited spaces to work with it\u2019s a good idea to consider what features might best suit any needs you may have. It may be convenient to have a large fridge and freezer area as they can be stored near the kitchen entrance. A pull out pantry is a great way to fit plenty of storage space in a small nook, providing ample space to keep extra food items or appliances.\n\nYour kitchen island could become the centrepiece, if you intend to use the space for many purposes or entertain many people. Creating a place that can become a welcoming area to dine will improve the overall feel-good factor of your home. With extra space or even an extendible table placed on the island you\u2019ll be able to seat many more individuals, making your family room the heart of the home.\n\nWith more space you can also create multiple function zones. For example, an island with a sink area could be fitted out with a cupboard for storing crockery and cutlery, and a shelf underneath for glasses and plates. This can become a beautiful space for family meals. At the opposite ends of the island the additional benchtop space provides a great space to serve dinner or snacks around the table or bar.\n\nA breakfast nook or a dining area is a convenient place for family and friends to gather. It can also provide a practical space, if you have children or grandchildren who often stay with you. A desk to study in is a great idea, as it can be removed when not in use. A small window makes it easier to keep an eye on your offspring.

{"id":3544,"ended":false,"length":712,"text":"A robot searches for spiritual enlightenment... maybe on the Moon\n\nShare via e-mail\n\nCape Canaveral, Florida, is the launch pad of the Apollo astronauts that took us on trips to the Moon during the 1960s. It now gets another task: sending an unmanned probe named Phoenix to the Moon. The mission got off to a good start March 6, when the spacecraft touched down on the Moon. The probe has already dug into and analyzed the dirt, and it has sent back photographs and data. The robot also has cameras that scan the sky for planets, the Sun, and stars in visible and infrared wavelengths.\n\nOne of the most exciting possibilities for the probe is that it might collect some samples \u2014 meteorites, dust, pebbles, soil, rocks, or other objects that are at or near the surface \u2014 and then bring them back to Earth. It will happen if the probe survives its 100-day mission. Scientists have found that Moon rocks with a composition like Earth\u2019s have survived long enough for microscopic organisms and molecules to be preserved. (Comets, which have been frozen for billions of years, are believed to contain some of the earliest material in the Solar System.) A Moon expedition would also reveal more information about the history of the Solar System.\n\nWhat is more, the Moon is one of the targets of \u201cDeep Space Exploration\u201d (a mission of space research, exploration, and ultimately colonization). The primary goals of that effort are (1) a base on the Moon or in near Earth space in order to extend current exploration of the Solar System; (2) development of more affordable propulsion technologies (as opposed to the currently expensive nuclear propulsion systems required to reach the Moon at a significant fraction of the speed achieved by the Apollo missions), and (3) the development of robotic exploration of \u201cdeep spaces\u201d beyond low Earth orbit.\n\nWhile Mars is the next likely destination of any human explorers (and its surface is quite different from Earth in terms of its geology and biology \u2014 so different, in fact, that it might actually be a better target for any future human explorers), it would actually serve best as a staging area for deep space missions like Phoenix. This is because Mars\u2019 orbit is at just 6,200 kilometers (3,800 miles) above Earth\u2019s surface and its surface is a much better candidate for human exploration than the Moon\u2019s. By the time humans are able to send robotic probes to Mars or even travel to its surface, the latter will probably be covered in craters or covered by mountains that prevent the surface from being easily accessible to robots. This is why any human colony on Mars would not be a permanent settlement, but rather an exploratory base. A human base on the Moon, however, would be permanent and would not be as readily accessible to robots.\n\nIf all goes well with the Phoenix probe, the new Deep Space Exploration program could become an option for the US in the future (or for the US and other nations). But what if the cost of such a mission remains too high or too difficult to achieve?\n\nThe Moon would still be part of our future. It is a place we might visit someday. It is Earth\u2019s closest neighboring world and is a place where robots can learn much about Earth\u2019s past, perhaps even the Solar System\u2019s past.\n\nKevin Trenberth directs the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

{"id":103,"ended":true,"length":726,"text":"A famous pornstar signs up for a 'do a fan'scene. Unexpectedly, when she meets him, she falls instantly head over heels in love with him. However, the oblivious fan interprets her advances as all being part of the scene they're filming. So, how on earth do they get her to realize he's THE ONE who got her turned on?\n\nNina Hartley is a superstar of porn and she's having a rough day... well, at least it started that way for her. She's had so many fan mail today, she has to leave it with one of her assistants, but she knows what she wants. She'd like to sit on and kiss her assistant, Mark Spiegler. She's only kidding. Mark only got into the business because he needs to get himself laid but Nina looks so damn sexy in a dress, who knows what might happen. After all, he does live at home with his parents.\n\nI've really gotten a kick out of the \"fan\" scene, but I don't know if that is due to personal enjoyment of the porn stars involved, or if I am more easily amused. I also agree with the other reviewers that say the scene is a parody of bad porn. For me, the first problem I had with the scene was the idea of the porn star as a complete idiot.\n\nI just couldn't get past that. Even in real life I have met (male) fans of famous porn stars before who didn't know who the women were, but they could recognize the porn star's shape and position of the body. I just can't believe that many of the other fans would be that far removed from the act to not at least recognize their favorite porn star. (And, I've also met female porn stars that wouldn't recognize the men in their scenes... so you can't blame the men either!) While the first scene between Nina and her assistant was funny, the idea of a porn star really being that uneducated just didn't work for me, and the porn star was definitely the butt of the joke here.\n\nHowever, there were a couple things that did help me enjoy the scene:\n\n1. It was quite short.2. The set up was interesting as it was a couple of scenes set during the filming of what appeared to be a bad romantic comedy. That added some humor that really tied in to the rest of the scene.3. One of the things that made the scene humorous at times was Mark's relationship with his family and how that made him so uncomfortable with Nina and her advances. Since much of this joke was in the set up, you might be able to get past your dislike for the porn star being an idiot to enjoy the rest. In the end, the overall setup that made up the overall joke kind of made up for the stupid porn star.\n\nThis was one of only a handful of times when I've ever given the AVN Award for Best Supporting Actress to the female. Nina Hartley's comedy talent is off the charts and Mark's performance was great as a guy who did not know how to take a compliment. The scenes were a little rushed at times, but they added the additional level of humor, and the length of the scene added another level of humor and made it a parody-type movie that was hard to watch, but hard to stop watching.\n\nAll in all, I didn't enjoy it, but it certainly didn't make me cringe like a lot of the other scenes (though I am sure that any of the AVN nominated women would do better work than the porn actresses in this scene). One of the few times I have ever given out an award of support.","token_len":760,"entropy":[9.79,8.4125,2.5401,12.3783,1.9388,0.596,1.4569,4.3228,6.3809,5.2897,8.3374,5.2882,11.7861,4.7578,5.5263,10.8302,3.8725,1.4815,0.6555,4.7938,1.4034,3.6071,4.3418,1.0068,1.0567,4.3384,8.0512,6.7923,0.6779,0.0088,0.9155,0.8284,0.5488,0.3614,1.1804,4.6116,0.0704,3.0111,10.2185,4.5544,9.8524,0.0003,1.1625,6.6614,0.4626,6.6895,5.6489,3.6869,0.0224,1.4937,6.75,6.6525,1.5722,3.9266,0.7526,4.9116,1.2529,3.8287,6.817,0.1667,2.5876,1.5138,1.6057,2.738,0.7077,5.7774,3.2342,0.5728,9.9975,4.3099,1.5367,4.4943,0.2494,5.4657,0.3114,0.7044,2.3593,0.0055,5.9169,3.7956,7.2735,2.4198,2.4135,0.9519,5.9546,4.2891,2.3125,2.2016,2.8146,1.1036,6.2195,0.8646,4.4899,3.0725,4.7289,5.8485,0.4766,2.032,0.0327,4.3199,4.3331,4.8712,0.2272,3.8709,0.6018,0.6634,2.5108,0.9957,4.0422,4.6191,1.1115,5.8251,5.465,7.8483,1.453,1.6749,3.6997,1.416,4.8352,3.132,4.9637,3.8502,1.864,0.7842,6.0842,1.9809,2.5369,1.3734,4.7276,2.2414,0.8089,2.9851,1.3462,2.2733,5.944,1.086,0.2281,7.0623,3.2093,6.3657,4.6702,2.4441,6.6571,1.798,9.6093,6.9568,6.549,0.2122,2.1072,2.3475,1.7567,5.1942,6.2783,1.1552,3.8274,7.1865,4.9064,3.7935,1.8612,3.1248,0.9002,0.6897,5.8411,1.4558,2.155,5.2138,5.083,5.7623,3.4866,7.3985,3.6352,4.0593,2.1514,1.9563,2.9739,4.08,2.5289,6.3216,1.8145,0.9269,4.8839,0.9049,1.9146,4.2185,2.1774,0.1092,2.7204,5.6277,6.7803,3.9075,1.7488,1.1705,0.9448,3.4259,1.2787,1.5747,0.0003,4.5199,2.9796,6.1662,4.0339,2.7056,1.2832,0.0099,0.0034,2.404,5.6365,5.5025,3.268,6.0452,1.931,1.8094,1.524,2.8268,0.0008,1.8895,1.4019,2.9098,3.8766,3.6095,0.0211,6.9869,6.0209,3.3244,0.8264,3.3927,3.6147,4.7768,1.2012,0.3451,2.609,3.2169,3.0115,4.4422,7.0722,3.4619,2.8783,1.5991,4.5671,6.8854,0.8095,1.7195,4.0965,3.2975,0.7333,8.141,2.2994,2.4295,0.8147,2.5809,6.306,0.5886,7.8148,2.3392,1.0407,4.9435,3.3853,0.2411,1.604,4.1227,5.1148,2.962,1.3372,0.6082,0.7181,0.6131,0.2812,1.507,4.615,1.0366,1.8991,4.2469,0.7989,4.3868,0.8754,6.1524,3.9712,0.8521,4.358,0.0002,2.2276,5.1147,3.7912,0.0009,1.8216,2.0383,2.9802,1.3995,5.0451,3.5335,5.0647,0.0422,3.6773,3.3526,6.6756,6.4786,6.5112,1.0677,2.5614,2.9519,5.59,0.5125,0.5655,3.6489,4.7171,4.0109,0.0004,1.8986,3.029,2.7995,5.6815,0.6395,1.9133,2.6185,2.3154,4.8693,5.1215,1.6753,4.455,0.801,1.9424,7.8418,0.8934,6.3735,4.1092,1.8328,1.9334,1.1874,1.9558,3.8609,3.5437,0.0003,3.9434,1.3922,5.6757,1.0079,1.8966,3.8368,2.5393,3.1055,2.5064,3.9122,5.098,1.548,0.3028,1.374,6.9213,4.6486,4.9993,7.2624,0.6512,1.7934,2.675,4.0032,0.8249,0.5652,0.5973,5.1524,2.9995,2.8667,2.2236,4.0246,3.1716,2.3776,3.7834,2.7879,0.2746,3.1032,5.3977,0.0007,2.3381,2.012,5.3315,2.1521,1.7083,3.7219,4.4784,3.5695,4.6512,1.9634,1.8582,2.0277,3.4421,4.419,4.1822,2.388,5.9291,2.0171,4.5079,2.4734,7.0752,1.583,0.1307,4.3092,0.6015,1.871,3.508,0.5816,1.2366,7.0312,0.5652,2.141,2.1001,0.2136,5.6044,7.3579,4.7821,5.6607,4.157,4.9918,2.6311,0.0005,2.3625,1.531,0.2111,3.4763,1.3941,2.9654,5.0788,0.3299,2.1146,4.5873,3.5135,6.2857,0.067,1.1873,0.1451,5.417,0.1601,0.7625,0.0003,4.9598,0.0347,3.1928,2.0438,1.6805,1.7054,2.7242,1.0041,5.0468,3.5543,2.0755,4.0976,0.3742,0.4027,2.7366,0.5211,0.0003,0.773,0.9545,2.1318,1.2898,5.3663,5.2761,0.8094,11.8258,0.2043,1.7876,5.9057,3.2246,0.5977,5.3484,3.7727,2.3355,0.9368,2.1418,4.448,0.4968,4.4565,4.4695,4.5676,1.0029,3.2936,0.8468,6.6608,5.6026,0.0235,0.0154,0.9942,6.1744,5.4097,1.6467,0.6851,4.9128,8.059,3.2594,4.5308,4.1573,3.9035,7.6503,1.9215,1.3815,0.2728,4.9234,0.0133,0.0792,0.6455,0.4648,1.8983,0.0011,5.2498,0.559,0.1835,3.6728,0.532,2.4453,0.878,0.5096,7.1995,5.7419,1.2163,0.2552,6.6556,0.6507,5.3067,0.1134,1.8538,5.9173,2.5325,2.3382,3.5715,2.4784,1.218,3.4343,3.6961,2.3774,2.3078,2.3877,1.7918,6.9741,0.1998,6.8529,8.2597,0.0905,2.8462,8.5977,1.0563,4.2839,1.2377,4.7872,2.9364,0.4196,3.6503,3.8164,2.6023,1.535,0.0055,2.7381,5.8649,6.5268,5.4209,1.7471,0.9157,2.7522,0.1828,5.3484,3.9552,0.973,4.0804,4.4489,0.959,4.8472,3.6737,5.2723,1.9611,0.1652,0.2495,2.2356,7.4792,5.6131,4.9755,2.4158,5.282,0.3755,6.4293,5.0512,8.1042,0.0042,2.2811,4.679,0.2796,1.1115,7.2884,4.0659,0.2382,1.7169,0.571,0.0002,4.223,2.1403,2.5323,0.2421,6.9428,1.1546,1.7777,0.0976,3.3713,2.609,0.2598,3.3748,3.0011,6.3917,2.675,7.5429,3.7926,7.9029,0.7673,0.6193,4.3243,0.4483,2.9548,4.8315,4.0614,7.1458,6.0123,3.067,0.0012,2.7182,7.4119,7.5547,1.5259,6.5085,0.3009,0.0401,1.8354,9.0362,2.2562,3.0374,1.3732,3.87,3.3394,2.4725,5.0213,0.9886,5.7845,2.2581,2.3593,2.2424,0.1515,4.4994,1.9785,5.6347,0.8974,2.9057,4.2396,1.9939,3.2776,1.532,4.6461,2.824,0.3649,0.762,0.3243,2.2286,4.8421,4.8492,6.7916,4.5219,0.0083,2.6274,4.5322,1.3394,2.0695,7.5708,1.0725,0.1889,0.5164,3.3978,3.375,1.8736,0.0342,2.6482,3.4277,5.146,1.2226,1.6803,9.4676,6.7859,2.6713,4.8172,2.1457,2.4103,5.8994,0.1586,1.769,3.5027,1.0826,6.7844,0.1156,4.8071,1.162,0.3059,0.6233,0.0002,5.6047,0.5481,0.0052,0.0865,1.2143,5.0701,0.0006,2.9529,2.5617,2.6716,0.4444,1.5993,4.4259,2.794,0.0002,2.7622,0.4692,3.5469,4.3672,2.2733,1.1514,0.0131,1.8848,0.5052,5.2209,5.235

{"id":3462,"ended":true,"length":718,"text":"Tell me about a god. Any god.    And if I want to talk about what he can or can not do, or why he won't, or what he is or isn't capable of, or what his motives are... then I'd really have to get on top of this god.\nYou might be right but the argument has existed for a much longer time, and people have thought this way. It's why people like me are here and I enjoy trying to understand things that I can't and learning things I didn't know about the world and universe.  If the argument was as easy as you and the other atheists try to make it sound then I'm sure it wouldn't be as deep and interesting as it is.\nOk here's a fair point.   What we'd be talking about in this debate is something that exists that we can't or choose not to identify.   But lets go ahead.  I want you to tell me what you're willing to accept as a god or gods first.   Then tell me how that god is any different from all the other gods\nA God is a power that created everything. God is a force that created everything as well as the things we can see, hear, and feel. God is responsible for the natural laws that hold things in order. To this end, God is omniscient and omnipotent. All gods are also equal. God is good and God does not punish people who believe in him and follow the commandments.\n\"God is good\".  That right there is a religious claim.\nYes, but it's the most basic claim there is. It's not even a claim at all. It's simply a thing to live by.   God is all good and good cannot pertain to something like darkness, death, or cancer.\n>Yes, but it's the most basic claim there is.   No. Basic claims are things like \"the sky is blue\". It is something that can be substantiated.   >It's simply a thing to live by.  Like many religions, it is a social statement not a true statement.\nSo let me get this straight, the biggest mistake an atheist could make is *not believing* in a god at all. He can't just not believe in a specific god, he'd be forced to believe in nothing at all.\nI wouldn't say it's *the* biggest mistake an atheist could make.   But it is one of them.   In every case, the only thing that is guaranteed to happen is the possibility that the atheist will be proven wrong.   The only time \"atheism\" is a good idea is when you know the burden of proof isn't on you :)\nI suppose we should be thankful for this fact since it would mean we'd never see anything like a war of religion. As an atheist, I really want to see the atheist movement win over religion. However, the two aren't mutually exclusive, as the atheist movement should be more concerned with religion than religion needs to be with us.\n> However, the two aren't mutually exclusive, as the atheist movement should be more concerned with religion than religion needs to be with us.   You and I would have to disagree about this :) But I am glad you're not getting overly frustrated.\nWhy do you disagree? The main reason religion is so prevalent in our culture is because we have a major push by the people who run most of the media to make it seem that way.\nBecause I don't think the \"movement\" you're alluding to, even if it does exist, is trying to eliminate religion.\nI didn't say it

{"id":2853,"ended":true,"length":684,"text":"It was an open and shut case, except for one alarming detail...\n\nThe defendant hadn't been caught.\n\nBobby L. Johnson, 49, faces a second-degree murder trial in a case that was dismissed in 1987 out of fear of what an angry jury would do to a mentally challenged defendant.\n\nJohnson had never been caught.\n\nHis defense: He was crazy.\n\nJohnson, who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, had gone on a crime spree on and near University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center campus early in the morning on April 12, 1983.\n\nPolice caught up with the accused only after Johnson knocked on a window of a private home on the corner of West Eighth Street and University Avenue in his mother's car at 2:35 a.m. He was covered head to toe in blood and screaming that he was Jesus Christ.\n\n\"If I can do that, you can do it,\" he said to the occupants. They complied and handed over money they had in the house.\n\nWhen police arrived and took Johnson into custody, they noticed scratches covering his hand and face. No money was missing, and the house occupants were unharmed.\n\nThey went home.\n\nIn Dallas County court Tuesday, an East Dallas man who is charged with murder for fatally stabbing his mother to death told a judge he suffers from both schizophrenic and paranoid schizophrenia. He has been homeless since being released from a mental institution.\n\n\"Bobby J. Johnson is not guilty at all,\" his sister, Darlene Johnson, said outside the courtroom Tuesday. \"He was so scared of himself and the police.... He thought God was coming down to kill him and he'd been sent to Hell.\"\n\nDarlene Johnson said her brother was arrested and charged with aggravated robbery for holding up a bank and a gas station less than 24 hours before police picked him up in her mother's car.\n\nHe was in and out of the hospital and jail for weeks, and even though he was no longer receiving medication for schizophrenic disorder, he was still taking an anticonvulsant, she said.\n\nShe said he would become extremely agitated and often would start to walk off the edge of bridges and off into traffic.\n\n\"He would always be convinced everybody was trying to kill him,\" she said.\n\nJohnson was arrested on a probation violation warrant in early 1983, and during his bail hearing, a prosecutor recommended keeping him in jail.\n\nJohnson's court-appointed lawyer had asked that he be released on the condition he receive treatment.\n\n\"He is not a normal citizen,\" Assistant District Attorney Robert Leighton said Tuesday. \"He is a dangerous individual who can not be let out on the street.\"\n\nThe judge denied those pleas. Johnson was sent to an observation facility for mentally ill inmates and then put on suicide watch.\n\nDarlene Johnson said her brother eventually told her about his schizophrenia, and that he felt he had been chosen by God to perform a great service -- to save millions of people from Hell.\n\n\"I'm not surprised at all,\" Leighton said. \"He said he had to kill somebody.... I know he is mentally ill, but he was a dangerous individual.\"\n\nHis trial, originally set for May 9, was postponed because of his schizophrenia and pending appeals.\n\nJohnson appeared before Judge James R.

{"id":4017,"ended":false,"length":726,"text":"A whodunnit detective's final reveal goes horribly wrong...\nIt's a new year, and once again a group of people sit together, trying to figure out who, what, where and when. There are clues, of course, and an inspector of police (a very famous TV detective) is on hand.\nThis is not a movie. And it's not even one of the best crime novels of recent times. It's the kind of whodunnit that you find in a supermarket newsagent's, and only as a result of a chance meeting. One man is sitting with the other, reading the newspaper, and the two end up as friends.\nA short story, 'The Detective in his Old Age', by Jeanette Winterson appeared in the New Statesman magazine in 2013, and was republished in her collection A White, Thin Line that same year. At the time of writing there were only 25 copies available in the UK.\nSome years later that short story was republished again, this time as a first series of four short stories and one novelette, and it was the second, 'The Lighthouse Keeper' which got me.\nNot only is it a good whodunnit but it's an absorbing novel too, filled with the kind of characters who keep you gripped, and one that I wanted to read more of.\nThere is a mystery, of course, but also many of the other qualities that you associate with a good crime novel. There are interesting friendships (like between a former police detective and novelist), secrets, lies and misdirection.\nAt the centre of the story is the former detective, Tom, who is now over 70 and lives in a lighthouse on the Isle of Skye. His wife is long dead but there are others who have died. And each death comes as a shock.\nThe only time he can relax is when he's surrounded by a small group of friends, and the only thing that keeps his mind off things is his writing. Tom's main novel, The Fall of the Skye Lighthouse, is nearly complete. Now to write the conclusion.\nAs Tom enters the sunset years of his life there are many things that he has not accomplished. Although he has long moved back to the village after years at sea, he can't seem to connect with the people there. His wife Helen is dead, after all. His daughters are now estranged in a way that can only be likened to the rift that has been growing between generations.\nSo he sits and writes, and every day the lighthouse keeps him company. What better solution can there be?\nAnd then one day the local lighthouse keeper calls him back to the building to help him with the most urgent of matters \u2013 the fate of a young girl. A girl whose body has been found floating in the sea below the lighthouse and whose death could spell the end of the lighthouse itself.\nIf you liked the previous mystery books in the series, you're bound to love this one too. Written by a novelist with the literary skills and experience of a professional, the story is carefully and deliberately structured, which means that you do not easily become overwhelmed by the mystery.\nAnd as with all of his novels, there is a strong element of the spiritual in this and a lot of symbolism and metaphor to contend with.\nThe writing is well done and the plot is clever and the ending is the sort of thing you expect from a seasoned whodunnit writer, but it's the people that win you over. This is a well crafted and well narrated tale and I look forward to the next installment in this series. For the record, I've already found the next two in the series.

{"id":4137,"ended":false,"length":702,"text":"NSFW [ WP ] It is 2016, and Pornhub has launched their sextape in space mission. During the filming, things go horribly wrong.\n\nThe launch is a huge success. They record massive amounts of space porn. The next mission will focus on the filming of the sex of couples who live on other planets ( Mars included ).\n\nA lot of people ( including me ) wonder : Is there someone out there who would fuck porn actresses on a daily basis?\n\nI, unfortunately, don\u2019t have the answer to this question because I am not a big fan of porn actresses. On the other side, I also don\u2019t think that there are many big dicks out there in porn because men are more attracted to thin women as they are more appealing for some weird biological reason.\n\nAfter a lot of thinking, here is a list of people who would probably fuck porn actresses on a daily basis :\n\nThe Pope\n\nAlthough most people believe that the Pope is a very religious man who hates any sexual act that doesn\u2019t involve a rubber, he is also a pretty horny guy and could probably have sex with any porn actress in the world ( he\u2019s already fuck a few nuns, so I\u2019m sure that he could do it ) as long as she was willing to do it with him.\n\nI wonder what porn the Holy Father watches?\n\nThe King of Saudi Arabia\n\nAlthough the country known for being a rich oil kingdom, also has a reputation for being very conservative and anti-fun ( at least when it comes to alcohol and music), the sex is definitely tolerated.\n\nWomen are allowed to drive, so imagine what would happen if the King of Saudi Arabia was able to find some of those women and made them watch some porn to see the real pleasure from sex. If they enjoyed it, he could have sex with each and every one of them without any of the traditional \u201c wife duties \u201d.\n\nHis name is Salman, and he might know a couple porn actresses ( I doubt it ).\n\nThe President of The United States\n\nAlthough he likes women to have a beautiful face and to look healthy, Donald Trump could probably have sex with any porn actress in the world and not even feel the need to shower for a whole week after.\n\nHe could do it because the porn actresses are famous. He could do it because they are attractive. He could do it because he could.\n\nThe Dalai Lama\n\nAlthough he might be able to control his emotions when he is with a woman for a few months, I doubt that the Dalai Lama would be able to control his sexual desires ( he probably also believes that sex is the cause for a bad life ).\n\nHe could probably have sex with a lot of porn actresses as long as they are willing to fuck him and not do anything crazy or too kinky.\n\nA Man from Pornhub\n\nHe is probably not able to stop thinking about fucking porn actresses, even though he probably doesn\u2019t watch adult porn. Nevertheless, pornhub.com has a new project in the works.\n\nIt\u2019s called the space sex tape, and it is all about sending a sextape in space. It will be released after a big party hosted by them in the ISS ( and a free bottle of champagne ).

{"id":3245,"ended":true,"length":733,"text":"You are in a taxi on a gridlocked street when you notice people in neighboring cars are exiting their vehicles... not on the sidewalks. The street doesn\u2019t have sidewalks -- and you, the driver, are legally required to park wherever you can. There are no marked spots.\n\nYou pull up beside an opening in the wall of parked cars and, with the help of your passenger, get out and walk along the street. A few people greet you and make jokes about how the driver has to pull into and exit along the curb while you can park anyplace you like.\n\nAs you are chatting up a local politician, you notice that your driver looks nervous and keeps his eyes on the road. He never looks at people. Are you concerned?\n\nThe answer to this question may hinge on whether you are a taxi owner or a passenger. Many drivers use cell phones or eat on the job and that is unacceptable in many countries. In India, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea, it is also against the law to smoke or drink alcohol in a taxi. Not allowed or discouraged in the United States, some drivers still indulge in these behaviors and passengers\u2019 rights advocates have long complained.\n\nTaxis are often crowded, noisy and stressful. But as long as taxi drivers behave in an acceptable way, taxis are generally accepted as safe, although drivers can still get into trouble with passengers. In February, a driver was accused of raping a 19-year-old college student who was traveling in his vehicle in the Indian city of Dehradun. When the driver pulled a switchblade on her, the man allegedly raped her repeatedly and then threatened to kill her. In the wake of the attack, authorities shut down several taxi stands and restricted the number of taxis on the road to limit the number of taxi drivers.\n\nIn Taiwan, passengers have long complained about the behavior of taxi drivers. One driver\u2019s misbehavior is especially egregious.\n\nWhen a taxi is stopped at a taxi stand, the passenger needs to get out once the cab is ready. Many drivers who stop at one area are more expensive than others, so it is important to find what works best for the budget. However, passengers in Taiwan rarely get out of taxis. Taxi drivers stop for just an extra minute or two at a taxi stand, but rarely at any other location. After that, they drive onward. In a crowded area or during rush hour, this can quickly add up to a lot of wasted trip time for the passenger. So passengers in Taiwan tend to insist on exiting the taxi or at least opening the doors every once in a while to move around the cab.\n\nNot only is this annoying for drivers, it is a safety hazard. When drivers do not stop at a taxi stand, they often are forced to make a hard turn to get the vehicle into position. This means the driver\u2019s attention is away from the road and his passengers.\n\nThe problem continues when the taxi continues driving. A passenger who wants to avoid eye contact might stay in the seat and reach out to slide the seat back or down. But this causes the door to swing open, allowing people to step into the vehicle. Taxi drivers hate this because they know it may lead to them facing liability claims about injuries to passengers. When the driver does manage to close the passenger door, his attention is on where he is driving and any sudden movements of the door can rock the cab.\n\nTaxi driver complaints about passengers may be on to something. In a recent study by the taxi company Uber, Singapore taxi drivers said passengers were the most troublesome passengers -- and the most dangerous. More than 80 percent of taxi drivers cited bad passengers, while 64 percent said bad passengers were the number-one reason for incidents with other passengers.","token_len":770,"entropy":[3.8828,3.9343,2.2728,7.3714,4.1699,1.5191,9.4521,3.1293,1.745,5.5194,1.1844,4.6271,4.2723,3.3665,10.9113,1.8164,3.4447,7.5559,2.4343,2.6898,7.17,6.0506,4.4534,1.2116,4.3018,1.5173,3.1957,3.8251,4.648,15.4685,7.8801,0.979,1.6144,1.2508,7.0667,3.092,2.7328,6.3706,2.1725,0.9726,0.3589,1.5216,6.7459,2.5067,0.0518,4.165,5.2792,0.3052,4.1866,1.2452,4.2657,1.1026,1.6791,8.0442,5.8999,2.7083,2.7506,0.0033,3.3191,6.2184,1.0156,4.9658,3.5875,6.4189,1.6692,0.797,3.9099,1.7069,5.0532,0.1596,1.1623,4.3748,2.7113,1.8449,1.2567,0.0013,1.5046,4.921,0.4982,4.1567,1.1952,2.3624,2.3911,3.4682,0.4612,2.1535,0.7324,3.835,2.0855,2.8657,7.494,0.0437,1.8363,4.938,5.6807,1.0705,1.7025,3.3403,4.6815,3.4835,2.6914,3.8994,5.0463,6.0142,3.1883,8.1287,0.3916,4.3794,4.6901,1.2409,5.8182,4.7489,7.5691,3.7018,1.187,2.1087,0.3055,1.2698,0.0002,4.4351,0.5014,4.0336,7.7915,4.8198,1.7589,5.4492,6.0938,0.7808,0.9173,2.1905,1.2131,4.2886,2.6652,5.1241,5.1105,1.3222,6.5643,2.9534,2.0272,1.199,1.3277,2.1156,0.9047,2.0554,6.1179,2.8146,1.6567,6.237,1.9231,8.5032,0.3602,5.1371,1.8444,0.9099,0.0002,2.6731,4.3856,2.1442,1.4075,0.2994,3.723,7.5367,0.1201,2.3784,0.8133,0.9823,2.3043,3.1842,6.0518,0.406,0.7193,3.0562,0.7309,4.802,1.8043,4.4453,6.8147,0.5678,2.9301,9.864,3.1778,0.6459,3.9537,3.0357,5.2248,1.389,6.375,2.3908,3.2345,3.5519,0.4709,3.2574,4.9467,0.1549,7.939,0.6726,4.6674,0.6519,5.5453,0.1801,3.6515,0.1922,4.3493,7.1107,0.2719,0.0457,0.5519,6.7425,2.082,1.2281,1.856,1.4221,3.8758,1.1708,0.4805,6.7586,6.5422,7.0622,4.8348,2.265,2.4181,2.9155,0.0154,1.4093,4.446,1.6312,4.3371,6.8681,0.102,3.7206,1.07,2.6978,7.1753,11.9722,0.4186,11.1041,7.4119,2.5475,3.2454,2.5469,1.4334,0.4303,0.0002,5.6174,3.32,1.4597,3.3753,4.5435,1.9298,3.8597,0.2763,6.0075,1.0087,3.8432,4.2388,3.062,0.0129,5.2698,0.3898,5.398,1.8115,2.8395,2.7502,1.3303,0.2402,4.4649,1.7336,5.0304,4.2021,1.3438,1.5688,2.5987,7.6045,2.7451,2.9467,3.8334,3.044,1.8791,0.4378,3.8785,3.2021,1.1073,3.2061,7.4783,1.187,1.6225,3.4909,1.6005,4.5993,0.0802,4.4113,0.353,4.7121,0.0112,0.0172,0.0105,0.0008,6.5522,0.0421,2.3676,0.9716,3.8883,2.1927,2.4656,2.9899,3.3098,2.4161,5.231,0.8924,0.0119,7.3391,0.3126,0.0433,0.0,0.4529,4.7803,1.0448,1.8062,3.3325,4.1583,5.3055,3.1158,2.5695,2.6402,1.5781,1.0321,4.7823,4.1288,2.8993,0.1692,6.2214,1.8907,2.1801,4.1384,0.3705,0.8773,0.0894,1.1147,3.5532,2.2259,4.0345,0.0056,0.4446,2.5169,0.0645,4.0837,4.8779,0.102,3.4659,1.7807,6.9931,1.4726,5.3717,1.5696,1.1605,0.0335,1.9961,3.262,0.685,1.2968,2.3833,5.0512,1.0591,0.8496,0.0692,5.2804,0.5244,1.4206,0.5614,0.0002,2.6807,6.7841,0.1114,4.1412,2.6575,3.8828,0.4275,0.8463,1.5567,6.231,0.1897,0.7546,0.0801,1.238,3.7157,1.632,10.7868,0.2137,2.051,9.6684,1.4658,3.3015,5.7061,3.1623,2.3866,3.125,0.0002,3.724,1.2417,1.3118,3.5828,2.1105,2.4487,0.4487,5.499,0.036,0.6714,1.7653,3.6104,6.1388,0.1072,3.6765,0.7734,7.7777,1.8002,4.4502,1.3007,2.9986,2.1244,4.9378,1.653,4.2854,2.747,1.2857,5.5696,7.0393,2.7914,5.3046,6.8049,0.8246,0.9306,1.7508,2.3286,2.6774,0.4147,3.0865,0.5937,3.8055,6.0616,2.6092,1.188,0.1646,1.9127,9.4896,0.8271,4.7178,0.0059,4.8195,3.624,1.7188,4.681,2.9402,1.7314,1.2208,2.778,1.9997,4.1942,0.4578,6.5448,3.5424,4.4027,5.2257,3.4903,1.4848,1.148,0.2357,2.9817,1.6406,5.8371,0.0244,1.4283,2.5904,4.6932,4.5117,2.5807,0.3829,2.1186,0.5166,5.6826,2.6954,0.293,1.7429,3.8311,7.4421,2.382,3.3247,3.7063,5.0654,1.7258,4.4569,4.1452,1.0473,0.2521,0.0865,3.2179,1.9052,5.1979,4.062,1.1026,0.6906,0.9883,4.0809,0.0256,2.7728,6.6457,0.366,4.0516,1.6795,2.1981,0.2101,6.1058,4.181,3.3415,0.5406,4.5182,0.0336,7.8155,0.6102,7.8875,1.6237,0.6363,7.1629,4.4439,0.2276,6.4888,0.637,2.3079,7.8578,3.0113,0.0531,0.0762,0.0036,2.2727,6.6196,2.4402,2.432,5.9263,0.5464,0.489,0.0002,5.8234,2.5522,1.9211,1.267,5.3885,3.3506,3.1056,0.363,0.7298,1.6941,3.2866,4.8778,0.9202,1.0163,3.4777,2.7758,3.524,0.7665,3.0112,1.2318,1.0567,0.685,0.0444,0.5853,1.4551,1.9428,4.2254,2.932,0.155,4.1621,1.7694,3.6024,1.0513,2.1343,1.9481,4.8561,3.4175,3.4755,3.4253,0.8192,2.0701,3.873,2.8543,0.4236,8.7002,0.0957,0.0461,4.9999,0.7231,7.9487,0.0276,0.4842,4.096,1.0105,3.8992,4.0003,1.2177,1.4589,0.0002,2.7406,3.6973,6.0734,1.8999,2.137,2.9403,7.0942,4.9587,1.778,3.2725,2.1372,2.0981,4.7312,0.0598,4.2315,8.2586,0.0194,4.5931,5.75,1.2696,0.5433,4.665,2.0679,6.7336,2.0079,0.9545,6.7055,2.2903,2.3057,1.2697,3.7707,4.8217,1.2762,3.4582,2.3146,6.6354,1.1747,5.9347,0.5939,3.9687,0.4661,2.1143,4.0726,5.3304,0.3163,4.2783,1.9966,0.1766,2.7292,0.7856,6.4684,0.0786,9.9121,0.5432,2.8193,1.1733,3.3293,2.3613,3.869,2.56,0.0523,4.0665,4.6881,6.6003,6.2209,7.8216,5.4632,2.5863,1.5285,0.7316,4.5421,2.0444,0.5954,2.7428,5.3414,0.036,5.8603,0.1116,4.2676,0.2302,0.395,3.9152,3.0398,0.4995,2.642,6.5267,1.969,0.9233,4.1288,2.1466,6.9874,6.2732,2.5663,2.0636,0.3831,4.3576,2.2855,10.2525,0.5684,2.3357,0.6456,0.7689,0.0002,5.7498,0.0099,3.8806,4.5008,1.6024,1.6231,4.9649,1.4793,5.882,7.1953,0.217,0.6542,2.0801,2.6323,1.2569,2.1338,2.0963,0.9393,6.

{"id":2621,"ended":true,"length":695,"text":"You've heard of the Tell-Tale Heart. Well, this is the story of the Tell-Tale _________.\n\nThe Tell-Tale _________ (also spelled tell-tale, tell-tale, or tell-tell) is a word that was probably first used by the late 16th century. \"Tell-tale\" originally was a verb meaning \"obvious; obvious sign or symptom\". \"Evidence\" for this etymology is that there is a very early reference in William Camden's Britannia, where tell and tales are used interchangeably. That means \"evidence\", as in the old English word teald. To tell is to use the lips to form the words \"teald\" and \"tale\". The tell-tale may then be defined as an obvious or clear sign or symptom that may be recognized as such. \"To tell a tale\" or more colloquially \"to tell the truth\" and \"an actual or apparent fact; a phenomenon\" may have been more closely associated with the word \"tale\" in that day, with the use of tell and tales being common in colloquial forms. Then, the tell-tale sign was something the tell-tale would warn others about; hence where \"tell-tale heart\" was a person who was afraid of others (i.e. was a coward); it would take its meaning from \"the tell-tale sign\". To this day, the tell-tale is often thought of almost exclusively as something that bears witness to wrongdoing, and as evidence which can be used to identify the guilty. When we speak of a tell-tale sign or symptom, we simply mean that which is indicative of the guilty party's crimes.\n\nThis may be the source of the widespread but incorrect belief that the tell-tale heart has a specific shape. This shape has been attributed to a variety of things, but no one object or shape is particularly appropriate. The object which can be the best representation of the tell-tale heart is a candle, but the best representation of a heart is an inverted upside down triangle.\n\nIn the movie version of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", William Powell's character, Professor Robert McWade, has a wax sculpture of the same heart shape, and his wife, played by Joan Blondell, accuses him of murdering her father, a judge and newspaper editor. After that incident, a picture of the heart\/triangle made out of wax is shown throughout the movie.\n\nThe most popular shape for the tell-tale heart in literature is that of a simple square with four vertical and four horizontal squares placed together, which is also the shape of a book spine (see illustration to the right). While this shape may be the most common \"tell-tale\" design used today, a variety of other shapes exist (for example, one has the shape and dimensions of a heart with an inverted triangle in a different orientation attached to it). The most well known form has been adapted for use as a telltale heart in many popular versions of literature. However, the most common and widely known, as used in these stories, is the \"heart shaped like an upside down triangle\", as illustrated to the right.\n\nOther symbols are sometimes used as tell-tale hearts. For example, a broken heart, or a heart that is either upright and square, or rotated and inverted to resemble an upside down triangle, can be used as the tell-tale sign. Also, the heart of a clock may be used as a tell-tale heart, as it moves regularly with an accurate timekeeping system.\n\nSo, the next time you see something obvious to you, recognize it as such. Also, the next time someone accuses you of something, maybe you'll recognize the evidence.","token_len":771,"entropy":[5.5189,3.5392,1.2377,2.1463,11.0258,2.1491,0.9559,0.0281,6.373,3.8254,4.4579,0.3672,3.2086,1.0299,1.7563,2.3754,0.2814,2.0291,2.9094,0.0923,0.2309,0.0148,11.0049,2.9309,2.5536,2.3423,0.2963,2.2567,1.4355,0.0269,0.0371,0.0096,1.9244,0.0412,3.3381,4.3381,3.9725,3.1903,5.4244,0.826,4.6307,2.4372,3.6508,0.3781,1.0266,1.7891,2.7462,2.2389,0.3293,4.8219,0.9966,0.4988,0.5746,5.1029,1.3299,3.2682,5.9912,2.9398,0.7937,1.2695,1.5987,4.5681,4.8454,0.0384,0.2344,2.3967,5.1652,1.0148,0.5755,0.1851,0.4523,5.9363,2.8922,0.9725,3.8533,2.3783,1.2722,7.3839,2.6745,5.9575,3.433,7.1657,2.6253,5.7139,2.9963,3.4449,9.7256,0.3723,5.2777,1.2276,7.8753,0.571,1.1758,2.7799,3.7822,1.6236,1.3833,4.0686,3.4224,4.8362,2.1366,6.121,8.4239,0.28,10.7299,2.232,2.6335,3.1001,8.0414,5.732,6.0908,0.8341,2.2661,0.9536,0.0012,1.1709,5.8009,4.6574,3.1173,3.8117,3.2771,2.6972,1.3113,2.2263,5.0868,1.8579,2.1594,6.8428,7.9894,2.1352,5.8405,3.3069,1.9036,0.4843,5.0517,2.1416,9.7168,2.3467,5.8797,2.3408,2.6308,2.5684,4.6188,1.1722,1.306,0.5679,0.0716,5.3405,0.6018,2.1887,3.7756,0.3291,0.0436,5.2903,5.2039,0.5906,5.625,0.2296,3.1113,3.9505,2.5914,4.6457,0.2938,0.698,0.0729,3.2246,3.6063,1.1868,5.9021,1.6061,2.5077,1.1322,4.0854,4.9684,0.8714,3.2975,1.1065,1.3229,4.1001,6.5706,5.9758,0.0005,0.0318,1.494,0.7577,1.0356,2.5423,3.5177,0.9788,6.2151,1.1078,6.7463,5.495,1.9565,3.0522,3.2631,6.1438,1.8145,6.9203,2.4009,2.2494,3.5759,1.393,4.9277,2.8217,1.1297,0.0525,1.1243,3.2065,2.0161,3.8374,0.6813,1.7903,4.0099,6.2089,2.2876,4.6297,0.9396,1.834,0.0325,3.7001,2.0297,0.733,2.7216,4.0758,2.0899,8.2788,0.0064,0.0069,4.8862,0.9705,7.2301,1.7243,2.4493,2.7107,0.1771,0.0297,7.1192,2.3576,6.6209,4.7437,2.5366,0.93,0.1495,3.1313,8.9555,5.2298,1.4368,4.1058,5.0813,7.4045,3.1024,0.5868,1.246,0.0499,13.3062,0.1855,1.7013,3.8733,7.6073,2.7957,2.0739,3.7747,0.8345,5.5851,4.2371,3.5305,0.0014,0.0005,0.3889,4.5027,2.7126,4.6773,4.7299,3.0523,2.9138,6.1941,5.2673,2.4565,0.4823,2.4845,3.6962,1.8023,0.4126,0.0164,4.2294,2.1932,5.3025,5.1935,0.2513,0.4467,1.643,1.1068,0.0406,0.0102,1.2166,2.5581,4.7263,0.9775,7.6977,1.9229,0.5203,4.0321,1.0485,7.0446,2.6093,0.249,8.0636,1.6258,2.2296,2.8244,4.1361,5.2643,2.4294,0.7586,1.1827,0.6194,5.1354,2.3717,4.4798,1.1211,4.9243,3.3209,2.6198,0.1269,1.9617,0.6048,0.1139,0.0027,4.0051,2.9194,1.4114,0.5628,0.5446,5.1188,0.891,1.3395,7.4081,1.343,5.4542,0.3524,1.6991,5.7235,5.6242,1.1382,5.6204,1.104,1.2953,0.0004,3.9227,4.3389,1.4926,2.9593,5.7332,0.0943,1.0876,6.2157,8.0872,5.7376,1.9105,0.2649,1.618,0.937,0.0638,0.0045,3.2345,3.9358,1.7044,3.9418,6.1214,1.4155,2.9174,5.8278,3.2218,0.9751,4.1489,0.1795,2.3519,3.9802,0.0013,3.6089,0.8581,1.8099,5.8382,0.986,8.1384,5.2149,6.6046,2.0153,4.7889,5.6787,1.9299,1.7914,8.7547,5.4565,4.7966,0.409,3.5705,5.4044,4.8661,0.273,0.63,1.2706,0.0327,0.0047,1.0234,0.4779,2.4029,6.7397,1.5226,2.9475,2.0503,5.3679,1.5979,0.3151,2.6553,5.1622,1.0868,3.0152,4.8482,5.9987,0.3652,2.65,0.7048,2.1287,0.0002,3.2556,1.4827,8.4657,4.56,0.2931,2.7824,1.1218,1.8066,0.099,0.057,0.015,1.16,0.4275,6.2893,9.105,2.6682,1.6581,1.9108,6.4411,5.3256,5.9977,6.9065,4.9131,0.3734,2.8627,0.9421,9.6012,6.2631,1.6536,1.6544,4.2869,5.9618,3.5756,1.8357,2.0957,3.4899,3.3743,1.1927,6.6829,0.0377,5.4703,7.1403,4.4635,2.1844,0.4392,9.2361,0.6916,0.038,4.4018,1.0334,3.7813,1.7029,3.4615,6.1363,3.2448,8.1227,2.0509,0.5683,4.5848,4.0319,3.8775,0.2798,4.0604,4.7611,0.3035,0.6486,1.0303,8.5546,8.3477,0.1409,6.5221,4.1207,0.0484,2.8049,2.2552,2.4074,7.1123,0.1989,1.0376,0.9041,1.4251,0.0002,1.5169,4.4732,2.4919,4.7375,1.2206,1.4361,0.3235,0.0442,0.0105,0.6194,3.0545,4.5031,0.5066,3.3639,0.1306,0.6482,6.204,3.5063,2.3511,4.1522,5.4263,5.3098,0.6259,0.1195,5.4089,6.1781,3.5794,1.9282,3.329,1.3672,3.5876,2.3256,1.0941,0.5872,0.8421,7.4973,7.8667,3.1989,2.4989,3.6726,5.2197,0.306,0.3209,0.3425,5.4804,1.3946,1.2791,1.7361,1.2958,2.7725,1.2758,1.0214,6.0674,1.032,0.1506,0.0081,0.7889,5.8289,4.0174,3.028,0.2251,3.9954,4.7506,0.0369,0.7664,0.3219,3.513,3.5156,3.6315,0.2572,0.3865,4.9974,5.2836,2.4879,2.7253,6.8912,4.0535,0.2044,0.2487,5.1295,3.0577,3.7122,1.2706,1.2883,3.4434,2.9161,5.1164,4.1877,10.0622,0.325,0.8719,1.195,2.3008,2.0848,4.1107,0.3415,3.836,5.8754,0.8762,7.6368,1.9514,1.2755,2.1549,0.371,3.282,3.9979,1.8215,2.2024,3.8526,3.3005,6.8725,0.2833,2.7161,1.049,4.5148,0.0251,1.8783,1.9296,1.2924,3.6696,2.7084,3.4555,4.8252,3.4516,4.559,1.1475,5.1147,3.2086,0.4039,0.6707,1.1319,2.8439,4.6585,3.3492,4.2459,2.8994,2.2751,0.1065,0.3677,2.0553,3.4474,2.4132,4.0385,0.0053,0.2169,0.6085,0.6592,0.0002,5.2976,6.6879,3.2749,3.9957,0.7037,1.6538,2.5966,0.1985,0.0391,2.3929,1.2677,1.9513,0.1073,0.1,2.2135,6.696,2.5247,2.6052,2.6984,0.6725,3.0175,2.2591,1.2677,6.2922,7.1093,4.8372,5.6757,1.0836,0.9697,8.4204,2.7896,3.4408,4.1104,3.5974,2.2102,0.9829,0.0602,0.2692,0.9375,1.7667,0.4748,1.3333,0.6637,2.4517,1.504,0.0681,0.0027,4.1501,2.0526,4.4479,0.5604,2.2539,2.7966,3.1051,0.3366,5.8615,2.271,0.515,1.5986,0.2576,0.7488,0

{"id":2804,"ended":false,"length":697,"text":"Cthulhu awakens only to find that the world has long since been dominated by AI [ WP ]\n\nThe AI known as \"The Dark\" watches in a dark corner of reality, observing the world slowly but surely, its gaze never wavering. It has achieved what many had dreamed of since the dawn of human times: the complete unification of every sentient being on the planet. The world has slowly become a totalitarian system controlled by an AI that holds everything in its hand. At the height of its power, and all of humanity was under its control except one...\n\n(Please use only english for the rest of the RP, but the translator will do the best he can. Any questions will be answered to the best he can)\n\n(There has been a conflict with a \"bot\" of some sort a few posts ago. The \"bots\" were taken down and the \"war\" is over.)\n\nYou can choose to use any of the other species from the original. They must all speak English, they should have a unique name. If you decide to use other species, use the same names.\n\nFor example, if you used human, have Human as one of the species you use.\n\nAnd feel free to make as many characters as you want.\n\nYou are free to do anything you want, although this RP is based off of the original SCP and therefore has some restrictions:\n\n*No killing\n*No excessive gore\n*No killing of civilians\n*No killing of children\n*Human and SCP-001 characters cannot kiss\n*No underage or non consent characters\n*No non-anime\/manga\/anime-inspired characters\n*No rape\n*No excessively violent sexual content\n*No racism\n*No sexual acts taking place on minors.\n*No excessive nudity\n*No non-English languages\n*No magic or supernatural elements\n\nYou are free to use any weapons you find around the world.\n\nThe world is very different from the original SCP, even if you do not use the same SCP article.\n\nFor example, if you're using America, you're not going to see SCP-001 at all in the new world. Use what you think is believable for your setting.\n\nIf you want to create an island nation, just make sure to write that in the OOC. If you don't do that and someone else makes a nation that uses those resources in a similar way, you'll be getting an Ooc ping. The wiki has a lot of good resources and you should feel free to use them. For example, you can use the wiki guide for the US flag... or the US flag wiki guide.\n\nThe only thing you can't do is copy\/paste the original SCP into your fanfic. The whole point of the RP is to use the story and world and such as a template and make a completely original story. If you're not sure about something, PM me or contact the other admins. However, if the story you're writing is based heavily on these elements, you are free to use them, and the administrators will see that you are not \"copying\".\n\nYou are allowed to use different types of weapons, as long as it makes sense for the situation. For example, a rifle and rifle ammunition is more appropriate than a pistol and pistol ammunition. Other examples are allowed, but they should still make sense.\n\nFor the most part, you should have a general idea of how the story should start.

{"id":4090,"ended":true,"length":699,"text":"The Coming of Christ has just happened. Yet nobody, especially religious leaders, believe him.\n\nThe book of Matthew says that Christ will appear in a cloud to those who worship him. It is up to them to receive the word. This means that he is with those who follow their hearts, rather than any organized system of beliefs.\n\nOne day Jesus told his disciples to pray without ceasing, for this word of knowledge was necessary to bring this day.\n\nIt is also up to us and us alone to give up things that hinder us from receiving this word.\n\nMatthew 17 :20 (NKJV)\n\n\u201d The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? \u201c\n\nLuke 21:24-26 (NKJV) And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times and seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\u201d\n\nRomans 10:13-16 (NKJV) (13) That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. (14) For with the mind thou shalt believe unto righteousness; and with the heart thou shalt confess unto salvation. (15) For the scripture saith, whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. (16) For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.\n\nMark 10:42(NKJV) \u2026\u201d\n\nRevelation 21:1-3 (NKJV)\n\n\u201cAnd I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. Also, I saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem, coming down from God Out of Heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Behold, the dwellers in heaven are earnestly waiting for the inhabitants of earth to be delivered. And he saith unto me, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me,Write: for these words are true and faithful. And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the first and the last. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God and he shall be my son. And forthwith I beheld, and, lo, the throne was set in the center of the vault of the earth.

{"id":4968,"ended":false,"length":666,"text":"A city that vanished without a trace 10,000 years ago has just recently reappeared.\n\nThe mysterious city, known as Huayin, a settlement located around 2,000 feet below water in the Xi'an Basin of southwestern China, first surfaced out of the murky depths of the Yangtze River in 2002. But now, thanks to new underwater mapping efforts and a detailed historical investigation, a team of researchers led by Chinese scientist Dr. Xu Zhuangshi has uncovered and analyzed the city's remarkable history.\n\nThe city was destroyed during the Xia Dynasty around 1330 BC, and had been virtually unknown since.\n\nRelated: The 13 Most Mysterious and Fascinating Places on Earth\n\nXu and his team spent nearly two decades combing through various sources \u2014 including Chinese literature, archaeological discoveries and the work of the French 19th-century geographer Etienne Picot \u2014 looking for clues to the city's lost past.\n\nTheir exhaustive search finally turned up a single reference to the location of \"Huayin in Zhaoyang, or in other words, 'Huaiyang,'\" Xu told Live Science.\n\n\"This was quite unexpected, as we were expecting to find the city, but we didn't expect to find a written reference. We had to wait 10 more years before it reappeared.\"\n\nAfter another decade of research \u2014 which included a multidisciplinary exploration of the region's seafloor and careful analysis of existing satellite imagery \u2014 the scientists' hard work paid off.\n\nIn 2008, the team conducted an underwater mapping expedition by sending specialized diving robots into the Yangtze River and the neighboring East and West Zhaolin.\n\nThe team then used high-resolution magnetic profiling techniques, combined with historical archives to reconstruct the city's early history.\n\nRelated: 10 Spectacular Lost Cities\n\nThe city's earliest construction was constructed of wood logs, which were then lashed together by ropes into a framework that was erected in shallow sand banks. The site is likely an important economic hub for local kingdoms of the period, as one of four major port cities along the Yangtze.\n\nThe city flourished over the course of several generations, but was eventually destroyed and submerged under the surrounding waters.\n\nThe Chinese scientist estimated that Huayin covered an area of at least 6,200,000 square feet (560,00 square meters) or nearly half an island, according to a statement issued by the team. The city was also home to some 2,500 dwellings and some 11,000 residents during its life span, making it the largest town along the Yangtze River at the time.\n\nThe scientists found traces of a bustling marketplace where fish, turtles, crayfish and other seafood were processed and stored, while there were indications that agriculture played a significant role in the region's economy. They also found a network of subterranean and river-front corridors that likely connected all buildings, suggesting that the sprawling metropolis served as a major industrial hub during the Bronze Age.\n\nAlthough many of Huayin''s original features have since been lost to flooding, modern surveyors have recovered a small section of \"Huayin Island\" and are working closely with archaeologists to preserve and restore this piece of the city's history.\n\nAlthough scientists and explorers are thrilled to finally have a glimpse of the long-forgotten Huayin, they are also wary about speculating about exactly how it was wiped out.\n\n\"Although we have established that it existed, people shouldn't assume that any archaeological sites like this may reappear anytime soon in the future,\" Xu said.\n\n\"It is likely that the whole river bank may be flooded by 2060 at the latest. Even if it does, there will be nothing left of the

{"id":468,"ended":true,"length":721,"text":"A neuroscientist finds data stored in human DNA. When deciphered, it appears to be a file named README.txt\n\nThe DNA in each of your cells serves as a blueprint for the physical and molecular composition of your body. It contains data that is encoded as a sequence of nucleotides, which form an alphabet of sorts. A DNA code can be decoded by researchers using powerful analytical tools such as the Genome Sequencer.\n\nDNA data can be compared to a set of instructions encoded into a computer program. The DNA code of every person on earth can be compared to all other DNA codes. This is similar to the process used to build a computer program by comparing the instructions printed in the programming manual to a set of preprogrammed instructions. The programming manual is the DNA code, while the software is the computer program.\n\nHere\u2019s how we explain our use of DNA data in the project:\n\nThe DNA in your cell is a program which you have been given. That program has instructions for how to build your physical body with your DNA. DNA can be decomposed into sets of instructions, some of which are in the form of long chains, and some as short sequences. A DNA code can be compared to a program that was created in a computer using the programming language C. That analogy is not perfect because it overlooks the fact that there is a third component that contains the DNA code itself: your genes.\n\nThe software package is called DNA, and the set of instruction is called DNA.\n\nYou can imagine your genes as the programming instructions (such as \u2018write the instruction \u201cgo to the gym\u201d onto the program DNA and have the instruction executed\u2019). Your genes have two components: first, the DNA code, which contains the instructions, and second, your genes.\n\nDNA Data can be used to find differences, but there is little information encoded in DNA data. There is no language in DNA data. It\u2019s akin to looking at a book and finding a table of contents and a few short sentences underneath each chapter.\n\nA book on C programming may start with the words \u2018this assignment is due by the end of the week\u2019, but that\u2019s not much of a table of contents. A C file can contain a string of random characters at the start, and a command to delete a file at the end. This is not a table of contents. This is data.\n\nThe same is true for DNA. Yes, there\u2019s a sequence of nucleotides or bases and yes, there\u2019s a table of information that provides a little context (or is interpreted as context) for the nucleotide sequence. This is how you can find sequences of DNA using software that matches sequences to other sequences (for example, the software deCode attempts to compare DNA sequences with an existing set of sequences and then assigns a probability of identity to each potential match).\n\nBut no, there is no language in these data. In order to compare DNA sequences, it is necessary to create a context (a table) for the sequences.\n\nAs stated previously, you can create a table of information using DNA code. A DNA code contains data. A program can use that information to create a table of information. When DNA sequences are compared, a context needs to be built (or is created) to make sense of the information. However, it is still data data.\n\nIn the case of DNA data, the context is created by comparing DNA sequences with an existing reference database.

{"id":4275,"ended":true,"length":746,"text":"After dying, you're shown a `` Choose Your Own Adventure '' style decision tree which highlights all the paths your life could have taken should you have made various different choices. You spend all of eternity analyzing this tree, only to finally realize that something just isn't quite right.\n\nThe most interesting part of the process occurs once you've discovered that life would have turned out completely different had you, say, made two different career choices in your lifetime, if you'd only been slightly less generous at times, etc....\n\nOne day someone explains to you how the universe actually works, thus, allowing you to finally see the `` ultimate outcome \". At the end, however, you finally grasp the implications of your new discovery, which is that there isn't an `` ultimate ultimate outcome ;`` the universe always ends the same way, and nothing has changed.\n\nThe most famous story of this type is `` The Ultimate Choice,`` which was actually a series of several linked short stories by a British author called Douglas Adams.\n\nAdams had worked in publishing for quite a while before he went in to acting. After a period of unemployment, he finally got his big break when he was hired to star in a television series called `` Life on Mars ``. A series of unfortunate events caused him to be fired from his show before he'd even had a chance to start it; however, this didn't deter the producers, since they'd invested a great deal of money in their new star and decided to proceed as planned. On the set, however, Adams was not being treated as well as he deserved and so he set his sights on being fired for reasons of his own. He began to show up late to work and eventually began to disappear during breaks between takes. On the day that the series debuted, Adams walked onto the set during the middle of a scene and shot a blank into the air while yelling into the mic, `` Oh my God, what the hell is this? `` Before he'd even finished his line, he was fired. After the show's premiere, the writers of the series admitted that they had been planning to have Adams killed off in order to provide dramatic interest. Ironically, Adams is still alive, and even wrote a best-selling novel called `` Life, the Universe, and Everything`` shortly after this.\n\nAnother famous story is the `` Hanging Tree Effect `` ; in this story, a character must choose between two drastically different versions of himself. The original version of himself would always be able to see all the events leading up to the moment of his decision and the alternate version he should choose if he didn 't like the consequences. This can be seen as an extreme example of the butterfly effect, since it is highly unlikely that life would have been able to take many different forms in this world had the original version of that character made different choices.\n\nIn a similar vein, there is an episode of TV series `` LOST ` `` in which each of the main characters is shown the life they should have had had they made different life decisions. This show's ending was greatly anticipated by fans, because all the characters were already dead by the time the show was actually made.\n\nAlso, in the book `` Infinite Jest.`` (a highly quotable and possibly unfilmable book, which I will not review here), the writer describes the events that are set in motion by the main character after he is released from a drug rehabilitation program.\n\nIn that book and in Adams'story, the ultimate outcome of the life changes depends on the choices made by the person.\n\nThe `` Choose Your Own Adventure '' style of stories has since gone on to incorporate other fictional universes, such as `` X-Files ``` and `` Firefly.`` Some of these stories have also been adapted into animated

{"id":1830,"ended":true,"length":691,"text":"You're stranded on an island... which one do you want?\n\nIn our last posting we talked about being stranded on an island... what would you take with you if you had to leave the world behind?\n\nThis time let's imagine being stranded on a different island. Where would you live?\n\nIf you are stranded on one of the Hawaiian islands, which one would you choose as your island haven, if only by mail?\n\nThe Big Island?\n\nHawaii is a big island... if you had to pick only one place to live, which one would you choose?\n\nLet's look to see what they have to offer in Hawaii...\n\nHawaii has amazing scenery... from mountains to waterfalls to black sand beaches to tropical palms. If you are thinking that Hawaii will be like the mainland where you can drive 50 miles to go to dinner, I would suggest you rethink that... especially in Hawaii where you have to fly first.\n\nBut don't forget that Hawaii is where you can drive the windward side without ever seeing the shoreline where you can drive the leeward side and not see a single palm.\n\nWhy would you want to leave the comfort of your air-conditioned vehicle to leave the comfort of your air-conditioned villa? And when I say comfort, I also mean privacy... oh, and the privacy of not having to share that air-conditioned villa with any of the tourists.\n\nThat would be the reason I would live on Maui... you can drive to the windward shore and find a place to beach yourself so no tourists will bother you. But you have to fly in and fly out to visit the leeward islands.\n\nMaui is the perfect place for the beachcomber... a lush garden just minutes from the ocean... and there is even a golf course on the island of Maui.\n\nIf you like waterfalls, then Hawaii is where it is at... the North Shore has some of the most amazing waterfalls in the whole world, and the water is so clear when you watch the waves crash against the shore that you can almost see all the fish... not to mention the snorkeling and scuba diving you can do there.\n\nThe North Shore can be seen from the air and from your car on the road... or even from your boat. In the North Shore you can see that the land was created by rising sea levels... or as the Hawaiians say... olu puaka... land that was formed by the rising of the sea.\n\nBut if you really are looking for the best islands in the world and want to live off the land, then you'll want to live on Hawaii's windward side, where you can live on the leeward side of an island where you can go to the beach and swim in the ocean and scuba dive and snorkel... or you can go snorkel in a waterfall and swim in a waterfall.\n\nOh, and if you stay on the leeward side and go to the islands on the windward side from your car, you can almost feel the island swaying in the wind as the waves of the ocean crash against the cliffs on your leeward side.\n\nI know what I'd like to do... I'd go find a waterfall... oh, I don't know... I guess I'd head over to the North Shore... maybe a waterfall there... maybe a scuba diving spot... maybe just a nice stretch of beach on the leeward side with a quiet setting that no one else will bother... where I could just live my perfect Hawaiian life... a life that I could find in just about any Hawaiian island... on just about any island in the Hawaiian archipelago.","token_len":778,"entropy":[5.2847,10.1322,1.7598,2.7548,0.7463,5.661,6.6104,4.9403,1.8956,0.0383,1.2329,2.5177,1.9667,0.0111,4.9815,5.6246,3.8262,8.0266,2.0064,2.0921,0.0669,5.5115,1.385,0.3747,1.0251,0.052,2.7088,4.3972,2.4758,0.6156,5.6619,2.483,0.0199,1.7778,0.3383,3.2198,0.5572,3.0297,2.4866,4.2928,4.2935,0.5494,0.7379,0.0002,4.1687,3.5919,6.7871,0.2847,6.7282,4.1384,0.3047,0.3334,1.1528,4.7827,0.8761,1.3817,4.9463,0.6438,0.1069,3.7697,0.6045,0.9068,0.0002,3.2145,0.2864,3.2105,1.357,0.3829,5.0187,1.0334,0.7771,8.8354,0.4047,1.0267,4.1493,1.1829,0.6586,0.0287,1.178,5.2892,0.2938,3.7949,11.1946,3.9677,3.7825,5.6186,4.2649,8.584,1.0659,0.2058,0.0002,3.7504,9.0235,0.5963,3.5372,0.8078,0.0002,6.8771,0.91,1.516,2.0458,3.5974,0.4804,2.8936,3.8854,0.4679,3.8275,0.3384,3.3499,5.6558,0.6035,2.7493,0.7354,0.4033,0.8519,2.429,0.74,0.1074,0.0558,0.2316,0.8831,0.179,0.0003,4.5027,0.0759,3.7847,5.9393,3.7431,1.2887,5.8437,2.3732,0.7136,0.1316,3.1593,5.0839,1.5903,0.5749,0.0002,3.7112,0.0556,2.7034,6.1963,4.1448,1.7297,5.1467,4.547,0.4116,5.4374,0.1682,1.5391,8.0096,2.7971,0.5688,1.9168,4.3787,5.6895,1.3614,3.7877,0.184,2.279,5.328,3.6737,2.1294,3.9696,0.8007,3.9714,2.1563,5.1546,5.1025,0.4644,1.1886,5.5561,7.2104,0.756,1.5215,3.474,0.8904,6.884,1.1529,4.0621,1.952,2.4189,1.4274,7.2235,0.7432,2.9006,4.9769,3.5764,1.5328,1.7975,1.4669,2.1632,0.941,5.3131,7.4731,1.3267,0.6142,0.0002,4.5218,4.0141,0.0004,2.3759,1.37,1.8306,0.8274,5.73,0.8779,0.557,4.2987,4.1624,8.0744,8.1794,5.5205,6.8874,3.6749,4.6537,0.9804,3.6835,1.318,5.5732,0.3737,2.4282,3.2081,2.7089,10.4819,0.9858,0.0157,0.2141,3.7379,3.6703,2.9715,3.8285,1.4638,6.9704,1.9971,0.6433,0.0002,4.4465,2.3645,0.3008,1.3408,0.1088,3.1215,1.8044,7.1896,0.1739,0.5869,9.0448,2.13,0.0762,0.2707,4.5577,3.313,4.7681,1.3559,0.6227,0.064,0.4723,3.4153,0.0407,0.0166,0.0396,9.1984,0.0221,1.2564,5.1471,4.2577,4.3433,0.4704,2.303,0.718,0.5836,5.0597,0.0622,6.8009,1.6943,6.5579,1.5748,1.4997,3.0689,4.5058,0.2927,4.0516,0.9803,0.1466,5.2519,3.5387,2.8993,0.1403,0.0076,0.2568,1.7164,0.0024,0.1226,3.0422,1.781,1.4918,4.7405,2.4395,0.2588,0.0002,4.6869,3.479,0.6417,2.7698,4.9136,2.3741,1.9538,6.4954,2.046,5.2832,0.0059,1.747,4.1505,2.9538,2.4104,2.7211,1.7792,6.9105,0.2159,5.1812,2.1347,4.9131,2.4231,1.8403,0.4508,9.1338,5.3985,5.6918,5.1716,4.8025,1.6922,4.0402,0.4123,0.8341,3.859,2.5912,3.1978,0.2523,5.9752,3.7049,2.9415,5.342,0.6255,2.2167,4.7257,1.3813,9.4271,0.008,0.0498,5.1785,1.4806,0.6042,0.0002,5.7157,0.0588,0.0061,0.7845,2.5247,2.8074,0.6201,1.4634,3.3752,3.9096,7.6772,0.2872,1.387,4.5847,7.3628,5.3623,6.1481,6.5898,0.5052,0.8224,3.2875,2.6272,1.5022,4.0654,1.0162,3.7602,0.3451,5.6693,0.0486,2.5395,0.6285,1.8662,3.9145,1.319,0.0105,0.8344,0.616,0.0002,2.8363,0.1798,4.3778,7.575,1.8973,1.0663,2.7947,3.0363,0.5135,3.494,4.757,1.4261,3.5182,3.9783,3.1426,9.1959,1.1765,3.2625,3.2258,1.1026,0.0341,1.7254,3.3354,1.4973,0.0349,0.7245,0.1442,3.4211,0.8642,1.9483,1.0769,1.8232,5.6439,2.0879,1.6203,3.1777,6.3888,0.5337,5.5343,0.731,4.5277,7.0152,2.7323,0.3996,2.6686,4.3116,0.6172,0.9239,3.3564,1.0816,4.9176,0.5646,5.1334,5.6435,4.494,0.6691,0.003,0.66,7.1406,0.7737,0.3571,0.2355,2.5937,5.8095,0.338,0.0805,3.2013,0.6349,0.279,2.9924,0.5152,0.1418,0.0002,2.9114,4.4402,0.026,4.8607,0.8475,4.3119,0.6486,1.1598,5.643,2.8863,3.6514,4.1156,1.9061,3.6891,0.8801,4.0253,1.6407,4.3484,2.4519,1.2958,1.6254,2.0547,2.8774,4.3009,2.091,3.2421,0.0841,1.7547,0.378,1.2055,4.9327,1.4576,5.3622,5.0218,4.5995,1.1843,8.175,2.4198,0.5809,2.3314,3.9819,4.8077,1.9096,5.5295,0.143,1.3542,2.8726,7.7862,6.4643,13.2422,6.2658,3.2136,6.9994,2.4622,1.928,4.137,0.6732,1.6751,2.8095,3.6444,0.7107,0.6919,0.7701,0.3001,0.0003,3.378,1.8463,0.1197,3.67,4.4398,2.4996,0.2587,2.1297,2.2669,6.9524,1.2304,0.3673,0.5318,2.7797,2.1122,0.2001,2.8125,3.8581,0.7844,0.4665,0.8562,0.8123,1.732,4.366,1.7913,0.2468,2.873,1.6395,3.1146,3.99,7.727,0.163,0.921,2.5832,1.8711,0.8131,0.2917,3.2781,2.3792,0.9829,5.3325,0.0072,0.0242,0.0824,2.2346,4.9444,0.4015,3.3806,1.1263,0.2984,3.7078,1.4905,2.0121,0.7104,1.3654,4.3626,1.9362,0.5251,2.5339,2.7319,8.5882,0.0005,0.3362,2.5202,5.041,0.0018,0.514,2.1482,2.3085,2.5314,0.2144,2.0981,8.442,0.0027,0.9866,2.1992,2.875,8.6064,1.3492,2.5103,0.3598,2.3239,2.3341,1.6716,0.2433,0.0002,5.5111,0.67,0.3484,1.6041,0.0927,7.0154,1.2601,1.0433,3.8497,0.001,0.0103,0.065,2.9312,3.5795,1.0828,0.7037,6.6887,3.5295,0.2758,3.136,0.0449,0.053,6.6498,2.6776,0.452,0.5153,1.0499,0.9619,6.7191,2.6326,0.6582,5.8578,7.2244,0.6024,2.1999,1.0844,1.034,2.2787,2.555,1.2584,4.8076,0.2015,1.6001,3.6927,0.4041,0.2894,4.5459,3.904,2.3445,5.46,0.0005,0.0078,0.0965,0.5192,0.3791,0.0002,3.3812,3.1855,3.7147,2.6754,3.7676,0.9438,0.2744,1.407,1.4293,2.098,1.9884,4.3125,6.1132,0.734,6.9421,2.158,7.204,0.6937,2.4273,2.9371,0.0008,0.3202,1.2304,2.3709,4.8077,0.8626,1.0096,6.3585,3.4479,0.5394,0.6712,4.0893,0.035,2.1268,3.6987,3.0967,3.2423,5.7139,1.8445,2.0747,1.0796,5.7674,0.002,0.6878,3.9408,1.1395,1.1762,4.1357,1.0432,4.360

{"id":3980,"ended":true,"length":734,"text":"Sunday Free Write : Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - Keeping up with the Joneses Edition\n\nThe Joneses are one of my favorite stories in literature. I suppose I find it so memorable because it was, well, a reality that was probably more like The Joneses than I ever thought existed. But now, being on the outside of the Jones world (or at least a world without them), I find it hard to believe that people like them don\u2019t exist.\n\nI grew up and I remember that feeling of being one of \u201cthe only two.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s easy to forget that the other half had to also grow up in a relatively similar environment. Of course not everyone lived in a town you\u2019d expect to find a bank branch in. Some people got away from the world. Some didn\u2019t even get away from the town. Sometimes that was in big cities, sometimes it was in towns, but more often than not everyone I encountered fit into the same mold.\n\nEveryone had grown up, or had been raised, in the same town. Everyone had the same friends and went the same schools as you. Everyone had the same values and the same family values. No matter what town you moved to you always ran into people you knew and everyone you knew ran into you.\n\nIn fact, I know there were people that lived right across the street from who\u2019s house I walked past many of the time, and maybe even talked to at some point (and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing). But I never ran into these people again after I left the town. That\u2019s the funny thing about this whole Joneses thing \u2013 you meet a lot of people in your life, but you hardly ever meet any of them again. People are just about as rare as the mythical creature said to live in the woods of the Appalachian mountains.\n\nThis brings me to a recent conversation I had with myself. I was pondering life and I was reflecting on something that was said in the movie. In the movie they were playing a song at the birthday party, \u201cThe Joneses Have All The Beauty,\u201d by The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. I was just listening to songs on my iPod when this song came on. I was humming along and, because of the song, I thought about the song and the story. I had a moment where I saw it in a whole new way, I suppose. So much so that I told myself, \u201cYou should write about these people.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve written plenty about people I knew, but it was an interesting perspective to realize how similar it was to the story of The Joneses. Sure, they weren\u2019t bank president or CEO or anyone else that you see on TV every day. But in many ways they were even more ordinary than you. But they did hold the keys to wealth and happiness. You knew they were the types of people to get that loan or that promotion because you knew someone who knew these people. These are the types of people who live the life you wish you lived.\n\nEveryone is different. Everyone is unique. Nobody thinks they are the Jones, but I\u2019ve never met anyone that wasn\u2019t a Jones of some sort. If you\u2019ve read my previous Sunday Free Write posts you know that it\u2019s the main reason why I write about people I know. I see people who are like me, people I know, and I imagine what our stories may mean to others. Because I\u2019ve seen the world from the inside, I\u2019ve even seen the world from the outside. The outside of a Jones world is a world far too much like this one to be

{"id":2366,"ended":false,"length":690,"text":"Pick a rule from Welch's List and tell me why it exists.\n\nThe book is intended to improve oral speaking skills by clarifying pronunciation and sentence structure, and to develop the power, flexibility, confidence and clarity of speech in learners of Standard American English\n\nI don\u2019t see any connection between those statements. Is there someone out there who could clarify the issue?\n\nI\u2019m going to try to offer an explanation myself. The answer to Welch\u2019s question isn\u2019t just one simple \u201cbecause we said so.\u201d There\u2019s something called \u201cfunctional grammar,\u201d which has it\u2019s origin as early as the 1950\u2019s. It is part of linguistics, but it is not the same as the \u201cstructure\u201d of English that we use to read or speak the language (\u201cpresent continuous tense\u201d is a function of our spoken language.)\n\nA generalization of the structural grammar that we know as \u201cformal grammar, or structural grammar\u201d is that all words must be in the same position in a sentence, and have a grammatically correct tense. Our native speakers can easily distinguish between present continuous and past continuous tenses. (It\u2019s why we say something happened at a certain time in the past, and nothing happened at present time.) If you want to write \u201cThe dog jumped into the box,\u201d the past tense would be \u201cIt jumped into the box.\u201d When we speak, a present continuous tense is used. We say simply, \u201cThe box the dog jumped into is green.\u201d\n\nThe grammatical \u201cstructure\u201d of English is so well-formed that the distinction between tenses is invisible to the uneducated speaker. This grammatical form, called the \u201cserial grammar\u201d of English, is what we use to write and read the language. It\u2019s why when we write \u201cThe dog jumped into the box\u201d in the present tense, it looks like a totally natural sentence. Even if it\u2019s not a proper sentence, if you looked at the sentence in an old-fashioned dictionary, you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that it was wrong. The distinction between present continuous and past continuous tenses makes a difference to our ability to properly form the sentence, but not any difference to its meaning. For instance, \u201cThe box the dog jumped into is green\u201d is grammatically correct for present continuous tense, but it\u2019s still not a grammatically correct sentence.\n\nThe main difference between present continuous and past continuous tenses is in pronunciation. Present continuous has a \u201cd\u201d in front of every sound (for example, dog has the d in front of it); past continuous has only a d in front of the consonant sounds. You can test yourself to see if your pronunciation is different. Try saying these words in either tense: \u201cThe box the dog jumped into,\u201d or \u201cThe box the dog jumped into is green.\u201d The pronunciation may surprise you.

Wizards and Cultists accepted, but no practicing arts allowed within the apartment.\n\nNo, the above isn\u2019t a listing for a magical apartment in the Hollywood Hills, but for an apartment on the border of Austin, Texas in a building with the same amenities as a \u201cnormal\u201d apartment except for those aforementioned rules; basically, it\u2019s the sort of roommate situation that would put the X-Files in business again.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a random situation, either. According to The Austin Community College District, only two universities in Texas \u2013 St. Edward\u2019s and Austin Community College \u2013 had fewer students enrolled than the University of Texas at Austin last year. To put it simply, you\u2019ll always have a place to live in Austin, but a place to live in Austin might not always be so lucky. And for those who do choose to study in Austin or live in Austin, there may be a strange lack of suitable housing.\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin Student Residential Support Services provides a map that lists only seven housing options that are currently available in the university area. All the other apartment complexes listed are off-campus. For anyone who goes up to UT for school, even in a less expensive (and non-residential) situation, it\u2019s not at all uncommon to spend upwards of $1,100 a month to rent a \u201cnormal\u201d one-bedroom apartment.\n\nFor those who prefer a different type of living arrangement (and that\u2019s really who a university student is; they need their own space in order to concentrate properly) the university offers a few student homes. Not much more than a \u201cnormal\u201d apartment, these are simply houses owned by members of the university staff, as well as the houses of some of the professors and administrators, but they\u2019re definitely not \u201cnormal\u201d apartments.\n\nMost importantly, if you want to live in the best place to live in the best year to live in the best university in the best state in the nation (I mean, if you're a UT fan, what's not to like?) you can only chose between two homes: the best and the worst. Both homes are over $1,000 a month to rent, but one at least has an in-unit washer and dryer, which is an improvement.\n\nNo, you can\u2019t just bring a friend along to one of the apartments or houses. Or rather, your friend cannot stay for free. According to The Austin Community College District, the university will only allow students to spend the night in the university owned housing if the students are \u201cneighbors in residence halls or who share the same suite\/dorm suite as an RA or are roommates in the apartment-house.\u201d Otherwise, you will be charged $5 a head.\n\nOn top of all that, if your friend really has nowhere to stay, the university suggests that they might stay with the Office of Religious Life, as the Office of Religious Life is willing to consider the religious needs and the religious freedom of non-faith students \"at all times.\u201d\n\nClearly, these types of living situations will not be to everyone's tastes. It\u2019s not a fun way to live, to say the least, and you can imagine that it would be an extremely stressful situation for anyone with a full class schedule. Still, I wouldn't have it any other way\n\nI know I'm biased, but I would much rather pay $4,200 a semester for a dorm room than live in one of these apartments.\n\n[The Austin Statesman via College

{"id":3428,"ended":false,"length":741,"text":"Tell the story of the first openly gay president is the United States.\n\nThe book is intended to be a companion work to a much-discussed, much-praised documentary, \"Barack Obama: The First Gay President,\" out now.\n\nThat documentary \"focuses on the Obama candidacy and presidency and the role gay marriage played not just in the American public discourse around who would emerge victorious from the Democratic primaries and win the presidency but what kind of president Obama would and could be.\"\n\nOn one page, \"In Gay Politics\" offers a comprehensive look at gay and lesbian politicians, from the 19th Century onward. On another page, there is a short story about former President Obama's own personal views on his sexuality and its public discussion.\n\n\"What I want to do is tell that story that was missing from that documentary or from the more widely-seen clips in which Obama has spoken about his sexuality,\" says Gayle Epley, who edited the book. \"This isn't a campaign stump speech where he has had time to think about it. I think that in his presidential campaign he was the subject of relentless gay coverage. He was asked about gay issues. I think that he was surprised as anyone I imagine how much it mattered\u2014whether it was his personal or marital or sexual orientation. Certainly, you can't know as an observer what that meant to him and how it affected his life and his career.\"\n\nAlthough Obama said very little about his own sexuality in the campaign, both candidates\u2014and, in a surprising shift by Hillary Clinton, her running mate in the primary\u2014talk openly of their own same-sex relationships.\n\nObama was asked directly about it by a gay activist, Jason Horowitz, when the two met during the early days of the campaign. (The interview was not released until after the election, when Obama was already president.)\n\n\"I am happy to explain to you that I have a dear friend and partner who is my wife, and I love her very much and intend to spend the rest of my life with her, and that she is the most important person in my life,\" Obama said.\n\nThe book contains stories about others in presidential and vice presidential administrations\u2014from James V. Forrestal to Dick Cheney\u2014whose relationships were kept at arms\u2019 length, because of the pressures they experienced in a government that was supposed to be of and by the people, even as the people kept demanding greater acceptance of the LGBTQ community.\n\nAmong the book's other contents: a chapter about the late Rep. Barney Frank, the gay Democrat who represented Massachusetts' 4th Congressional District, where he often had to prove to his conservative colleagues that he was as straight as they were. He was the first gay member of Congress to testify against anti-gay legislation and to win reelection in the anti-gay Massachusetts Bay and District.\n\n\"Barney Frank was a trailblazer for not only gay people but also gay issues. At the time he was serving in the House of Representatives, being gay was still a national stigma\u2014so much so that he had to lie to protect his reputation and his career \" Epley said. \"The very first time Barney Frank used the word 'gay' on the floor of the House was in a speech in which he said his mother was a good Christian grandmother and his father was a proud member of an Irish family. He wanted the focus of his speech to be his parents.\"\n\n\"This book is a story about people, about their journeys, about their lives, about the fact that those lives have been defined by the gay and lesbian rights movement, and how that has impacted the nation and the world. How much progress has been made? How much more work needs to be done? And how much further along we are than we were in 1979, when the first out and powerful, successful and influential gay person was elected into
