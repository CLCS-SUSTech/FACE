In later periods you can try new weapons and vehicles.","token_len":146,"entropy":[6.7017,5.5283,2.679,0.9562,7.3262,3.1143,0.5037,1.7695,6.1484,2.9427,2.7273,0.0701,4.5452,6.4529,0.5128,5.769,3.8558,5.2187,1.8168,1.7192,4.203,1.8511,6.0735,4.3563,4.4991,1.0163,2.7572,0.7889,6.3018,4.8378,6.1503,0.0334,0.8761,12.8968,2.5132,6.3851,6.3402,2.3293,4.3737,6.9513,0.4891,8.9407,0.5113,2.8153,2.3886,0.5287,7.0171,11.1152,1.8979,2.7249,5.6684,6.3455,0.7281,1.5315,3.9518,4.755,5.6624,1.528,3.9134,4.6907,2.6471,6.4378,3.3652,5.0981,1.74,2.214,1.6876,4.5507,3.2754,1.5509,0.5179,1.206,7.7661,1.9289,1.6181,0.2459,1.8342,1.6807,1.1697,1.5146,0.0568,5.6136,2.961,7.2792,1.0069,2.7183,2.4609,2.8917,7.7727,0.8053,2.1111,6.2832,1.5626,1.2526,1.4159,0.6621,6.6439,1.4625,3.1485,5.6274,2.3504,0.0002,1.3629,5.0328,1.0137,2.2843,2.8601,2.9944,0.1011,3.6705,6.7394,1.9215,3.6811,7.4398,0.0167,4.4735,2.173,1.9302,0.0003,0.1748,1.329,1.8124,4.758,1.5332,2.9719,1.7062,4.4476,6.7842,1.5882,3.3864,2.9528,1.8796,1.896,0.5111,3.7549,6.5145,3.1212,3.0451,1.5059,3.9409,4.791,5.7689,1.2862,5.0381,1.3178]}

Of course, this may all be wrong; but at the minimum, I think that we can say that the whole \"writing\" world will certainly evolve more than it is now.","token_len":178,"entropy":[11.5031,6.7245,5.3465,2.0369,0.6131,3.1927,8.5169,6.3821,1.9552,0.4517,0.5916,2.0071,2.8449,8.4158,0.5348,2.3416,0.5503,0.8713,0.0022,5.1993,4.2645,1.1177,4.0831,2.019,0.9126,5.0489,2.6282,0.0545,5.1886,5.6664,1.7327,1.9903,7.2281,2.9239,2.33,4.0404,1.079,2.7816,4.1349,1.9943,2.4732,3.007,5.0468,0.0003,0.1039,0.0328,7.0773,0.033,0.935,2.5841,1.079,0.3776,5.6365,1.3265,0.9666,3.1924,3.9607,3.0061,7.5128,5.4141,1.809,1.4063,1.4184,7.8298,5.8159,7.1727,1.7195,0.3495,3.5994,6.0014,2.1621,3.4646,0.6071,0.0956,3.2038,3.1693,4.2108,5.1229,4.0082,2.2893,0.4529,3.308,0.9407,3.5567,0.0099,4.9153,1.1933,2.1306,5.031,0.3606,3.3257,3.4416,5.7658,6.7334,5.5996,4.0938,0.9182,5.0578,0.684,6.867,1.1727,1.8834,5.4308,2.1426,0.669,6.0408,1.2663,4.3362,4.4356,1.7797,2.0531,7.0864,3.469,2.5591,1.8214,2.4404,3.9699,3.4828,2.8495,2.9955,3.4655,0.7753,4.9049,1.1849,4.1958,0.6745,8.8346,1.1753,1.514,0.2485,3.6298,5.113,0.7891,3.3977,1.6608,3.3183,4.8384,1.8746,0.7147,7.7478,1.8358,5.8164,0.0029,0.167,3.0494,2.9905,4.4036,1.2041,5.8682,3.9658,2.2157,3.6578,1.6943,6.9098,0.385,2.8735,0.9517,2.3421,2.3666,2.4597,4.1793,0.4645,2.2606,4.9282,3.3026,1.3013,0.7859,3.5123,0.7598,8.5186,2.9355,5.0975,3.2134,4.0978,2.7866,1.2765,0.507]}

{"id":1214,"ended":true,"length":165,"text":"In a society where medicine has solved the problem of aging, people routinely live for centuries. In a world where everyone appears roughly the same age, how does `` real '' age affect relationships? How does it affect the relationship between a 25-year-old and a 50-year-old? How does it affect the relationship between two couples who live in two different neighborhoods, one in their 20s and the other in their 70s?\n\nIn Life Span, acclaimed science writer James Gleick explores the profound and sometimes bizarre ways in which humans are affected by their very bodies. He argues that if we understand how humans and their bodies age, we can gain better insights into the nature of science itself. In a fascinating investigation of everything from the human brain to DNA and beyond, Gleick offers a provocative new look not only at our own personal age but at the age of science itself.","token_len":179,"entropy":[3.4603,6.9686,1.0939,8.8914,2.8065,9.2788,1.6889,1.5354,0.3036,5.4683,0.5363,5.0546,7.91,5.3266,3.8922,4.9257,1.5817,3.0835,2.5686,2.6195,0.3201,4.4936,8.0398,8.6078,1.2906,0.0177,0.3015,0.3295,4.8211,2.9942,14.5467,13.4078,4.1861,1.8289,3.4828,6.7852,0.7665,2.8554,0.7478,2.5538,0.3729,2.5169,3.9806,0.678,2.3861,9.8658,0.0845,0.0773,0.2414,0.0016,0.4986,0.594,2.1471,0.003,0.0003,0.0103,0.0002,0.2592,1.8549,0.3295,0.7202,0.1243,1.2082,0.3322,0.0163,3.3594,4.1968,1.9325,2.0734,1.5131,5.0823,0.5615,4.0927,2.594,2.8106,0.9646,4.182,1.8627,0.0593,0.2888,1.5779,0.0053,0.1403,0.0392,4.3064,0.0016,0.1766,2.6701,0.0008,2.7179,9.4756,7.3598,1.9807,10.4618,4.6168,1.0707,4.3033,7.9777,1.7502,2.342,1.4171,6.2927,2.9595,2.3521,4.3586,3.2452,1.2591,0.0003,4.3159,2.4879,3.1625,0.1133,2.8544,5.3145,3.4993,0.3765,2.4745,3.2858,0.1188,4.4263,1.0641,4.5117,1.6667,3.1023,4.2819,1.5974,1.0974,5.8919,0.5286,0.4937,0.5036,5.0069,4.4174,2.6452,0.1137,1.4446,2.6612,0.1203,8.6079,3.7412,0.4321,3.2375,2.4904,5.1183,6.5288,0.5741,7.5046,0.1199,1.4345,3.2146,1.8527,0.2881,3.7806,2.0351,5.7206,0.0513,0.2997,0.0004,3.5926,1.1529,3.7843,1.8261,3.3296,8.7758,0.3632,0.0907,3.3049,2.8177,4.5465,5.6429,1.3449,2.0787,0.823,5.7187,1.3768,4.0801,0.3646,0.1697]}

I think I'll just leave this bomb in the middle of a crowded room and go fight crime instead of calling the cops and saving people\" is always silly because obviously they are not going to use that power right away.","token_len":195,"entropy":[6.35,1.7086,11.2928,4.1269,2.518,3.6346,6.525,1.4133,2.0173,1.2567,8.3168,3.1625,0.0043,0.0037,0.0004,1.3798,1.6573,7.9237,3.1586,0.0007,1.7474,1.7043,1.1711,0.4592,0.7979,3.4159,5.3332,2.5186,1.4862,8.7741,0.8382,7.3212,0.6902,1.9399,3.954,1.8657,1.5954,5.2289,0.8198,2.2641,6.4416,4.9171,2.2863,3.9457,2.6557,6.8986,0.8215,6.5444,3.6791,5.4576,6.026,2.6461,6.2235,4.6529,8.4327,2.1162,2.653,1.3513,2.2278,3.5364,4.4574,2.133,2.1151,3.3525,2.0702,1.266,5.7772,4.4662,8.9836,0.0185,0.0141,0.0097,0.02,1.3318,2.6856,8.4285,2.9246,1.2405,1.3504,0.2712,0.7943,4.5267,1.5562,4.7654,0.0193,6.9179,3.142,2.7415,0.4199,4.5212,6.649,0.2431,0.785,5.517,5.8735,3.9426,0.0036,5.9944,0.0125,0.2308,9.0657,3.2163,2.2373,1.8006,1.7069,0.7094,1.3251,6.2108,3.9783,2.4858,0.5593,0.8341,2.246,5.369,0.4328,2.9258,5.5541,1.3661,0.3535,4.7819,5.831,3.2861,3.653,6.5044,2.2862,4.2227,3.1719,5.2363,4.8536,3.4199,3.2251,8.5111,3.1866,2.9311,0.4083,4.4189,4.7335,1.4439,3.5836,5.0383,2.4033,2.9335,6.3451,3.7168,3.4351,3.1168,3.1828,1.1252,2.0105,4.2887,1.2314,5.7545,0.6821,3.2641,3.5606,5.6648,1.5858,9.0807,1.8639,1.0352,4.2543,0.054,1.8763,4.9016,4.345,1.8494,2.8968,4.9983,5.6435,4.8584,1.7502,7.4592,1.962,0.4835,2.9306,3.4455,2.3769,2.8258,2.5302,5.0551,6.978,4.5598,6.5585,2.1712,3.2716,2.8713,2.0116,0.0188,3.5365,1.991,0.7447,5.4956,0.7852,0.7286]}

Or you can just think of something you might do, something that you thought a scene could go, but have you also thought that there might be an alternate plot (I guess I will call that a twist) that you would have to write instead of what you had prepared beforehand?","token_len":199,"entropy":[8.0605,4.4272,1.9992,8.241,3.4962,4.0827,4.2464,4.8752,2.7371,4.1633,2.2608,2.1708,6.9216,4.277,6.6431,7.2859,1.989,6.3198,4.3303,5.4144,3.2847,2.1255,6.5509,0.939,2.6342,2.1767,3.8586,5.4014,2.8897,0.6924,4.6854,6.5125,1.9707,7.6051,4.7376,3.924,4.9318,6.6928,0.7555,0.4791,1.9572,2.4334,3.8751,6.1946,8.73,5.4316,2.5075,0.6261,1.4348,9.421,3.2489,1.182,6.7808,5.4988,1.9265,1.1659,0.0374,0.0017,1.0419,3.1239,0.5618,6.6162,0.8907,4.437,2.4137,1.9862,8.5703,5.0175,7.2368,5.8454,5.8512,4.893,2.2462,2.7994,1.6687,0.4985,0.0599,2.2159,0.3713,2.3817,7.075,2.1505,4.2321,1.2173,4.2689,5.6851,0.3959,1.6694,3.8551,0.908,3.4523,3.8229,5.4163,4.2263,5.8324,3.5252,0.5598,3.0469,3.1857,0.0423,3.6503,1.1252,5.4798,4.794,6.8921,1.9209,2.2035,2.5809,3.3995,1.8833,0.2491,0.2933,2.9807,0.016,1.0077,2.6321,3.4052,2.9698,2.1598,3.4696,5.2066,3.4218,7.5017,1.163,4.4196,1.1104,2.2522,5.4642,0.461,7.9753,3.1298,3.4027,0.127,5.4276,0.138,1.4193,1.6675,3.5933,2.0551,5.5029,1.1715,0.8119,6.1088,5.0548,2.2646,2.9125,5.6,1.2272,1.3926,1.9321,4.0509,2.0193,3.3699,4.182,0.9887,1.4044,3.9558,5.372,6.0926,2.2903,2.7209,3.7861,2.6754,4.1128,3.408,6.3184,1.8604,3.3815,4.0974,1.8144,0.3429,3.3336,2.8847,5.2785,5.7381,4.2372,4.8415,2.4202,4.0619,4.0922,2.2204,2.3983,4.1363,1.5674,0.9055,1.5315,2.3729,1.955,2.0347,3.4412,5.099,1.4557,4.394,0.932,2.6456,5.4842,3.1004,1.4769]}
