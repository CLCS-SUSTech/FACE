DHS Assistant","text":"The Trump administration on Monday will order federal agencies to adopt common email security standards in an effort to better protect against hackers, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said. DHS Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity James Crowley told reporters on board Air Force One that \" over the course of the last year we've seen a great deal of success, with the Department of Homeland Security and the rest of the government's cybersecurity workforce using their own security tools, adopting their own security processes, and they're using their own tools for securing email. \" Crowley said agencies' \" email security policies, standards, and procedures are the basis of almost all of the work they're doing right now \" and that the DHS \" expects federal agencies to quickly adopt common practices for their own cybersecurity. \" The move comes as the White House's top cybersecurity official, National Security Agency director Michael Rogers, is under more criticism than ever over the agency's handling of allegations of Russian influence on the country's elections. The New York Times reported last month that five people familiar with the matter said the DHS was unaware of Russian interference until September, and later that the agency's director told journalists in a private session that he was \" shocked \" when he received the news in the autumn. Since then, he has denied that Russia was behind the election interference and said that DHS spent too little on cybersecurity in their budget the previous year. A DHS official said Monday that agencies are required to have cybersecurity plans that include what action they are taking to counter threats, such as hacking. Crowley said Monday the DHS also \" has a robust internal audit program to review federal agency cybersecurity. \" The Trump administration, which has been criticized over the past few years for failing to prioritize cybersecurity, has been criticised for its handling of the hacking of the Sony Pictures studio and the US State Department in 2015 and 2016. Trump and his administration have also been criticised for failing to stop the breach at Yahoo in 2013, though the DHS has pointed to its investment in securing the company's network.","token_len":400,"entropy":[7.6977,0.9163,4.4464,1.8432,5.4656,6.1216,4.4731,0.9219,0.1501,5.1336,6.7354,10.1914,4.0127,1.2665,4.0303,2.2864,0.1773,0.0058,4.0717,0.388,3.5661,2.7647,2.0374,2.9413,3.0481,5.4077,0.0124,0.1066,0.0006,0.0211,0.4598,0.2979,8.4525,8.612,0.1333,1.6155,2.4213,1.1262,4.3372,6.9452,1.8737,0.619,2.4013,7.6371,1.8611,0.0008,0.0035,0.4382,2.9599,16.3462,0.5136,3.039,0.002,0.7791,3.4533,1.9529,1.8064,0.4593,1.558,1.2772,4.5232,0.4267,0.1344,4.7901,3.3217,3.2497,1.8415,4.3416,0.0755,0.1664,0.0014,2.5132,0.8106,6.3696,0.0284,0.1871,1.3396,5.3021,4.4311,4.2165,5.3511,3.8525,1.7789,3.2669,2.6205,2.7173,7.7609,4.0189,0.0416,2.5441,4.6909,1.1829,0.5457,3.9652,0.7241,2.7335,1.7786,0.0863,1.8867,3.7379,5.0537,4.6,3.1275,2.5757,12.6197,0.6183,6.4435,5.4435,3.0873,7.1479,0.8009,3.9007,3.4248,5.1152,0.5527,0.2726,1.6045,0.9351,3.2598,4.0928,1.5707,6.6584,0.7783,1.5096,1.0983,3.197,1.6846,1.2901,0.2279,3.4364,0.0109,8.8184,1.3628,1.279,1.7169,4.1514,2.3349,8.9245,4.25,0.1371,0.1228,6.2331,0.8409,2.7803,4.3233,2.0441,2.8964,1.6137,3.3656,2.6973,1.6155,3.0349,4.5206,1.5448,1.4338,1.1389,2.6345,0.0006,3.8942,3.1414,0.806,0.4158,1.9663,4.794,0.0872,1.8817,3.3497,1.9082,0.3239,0.1263,2.5195,3.6279,7.9903,5.1127,3.1096,0.6673,2.4255,1.4474,2.0232,0.0212,1.5697,0.0049,6.6398,0.3638,2.4963,2.8701,2.206,0.243,8.7267,0.1998,1.795,0.4594,2.209,5.1431,0.023,0.0188,0.6419,1.7166,1.2602,0.0406,6.805,3.2493,5.1968,0.0003,0.2919,0.4144,1.7966,1.5685,6.9544,2.2901,6.0929,0.2896,3.211,2.0166,2.8834,6.1544,1.8314,2.7006,6.3299,1.717,1.9162,0.5136,2.7484,4.1026,4.1539,5.5958,2.4189,2.351,2.8321,4.9603,0.5617,2.1631,1.9342,2.1601,10.2253,3.7467,2.0802,0.9487,3.927,1.2938,2.634,4.6351,2.9262,6.9377,0.7737,6.467,0.2485,0.0853,4.9675,0.4863,4.094,2.7161,2.2825,1.9646,1.0613,0.4316,2.8269,2.2726,2.2436,1.6507,1.4713,6.0885,7.9792,3.8519,2.5139,2.0655,1.859,3.2816,6.6472,4.6907,7.429,1.0753,0.1746,0.355,4.1547,2.1985,0.9192,1.3373,3.1605,0.2469,5.6548,1.6932,5.5431,0.2834,4.8973,5.0517,4.2833,2.2763,2.7115,4.9196,9.3376,1.1463,2.763,0.2371,0.814,3.9459,4.1293,1.9992,1.9625,0.001,4.1007,1.7269,6.1312,0.6269,3.8292,2.9383,2.2524,4.8631,2.8819,3.1964,1.4539,4.64,4.4722,5.5809,2.5497,1.8336,3.9224,5.0346,3.3095,1.7073,3.5075,0.4016,2.1316,5.1294,0.0554,4.0363,2.5692,1.2249,2.0198,2.3198,3.2038,1.1602,0.8644,1.8178,1.9682,0.3534,2.3777,0.0174,5.3145,0.784,1.0384,1.4204,2.5685,5.8567,0.5852,2.3203,2.8736,0.0049,1.1084,3.9236,0.5505,1.9788,5.6927,0.4176,3.1105,1.3297,1.6025,6.3427,5.854,0.0101,3.0298,2.8698,2.1582,0.2696,0.5122,3.8748,3.8011,0.9902,1.9718,0.5711,1.6521,1.442,3.2793,0.3481,1.3984,0.0131,5.0629,1.0002,6.6073,3.702,6.3684,2.7292,3.483,1.0737,4.8802,1.3627,7.7677,2.0331,6.3298,0.5926,2.7673,8.3473,0.1765,6.0461,1.1707,1.88,0.7194,3.639,1.8934]}

Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), the bill\u2019s ranking member, said on Monday that he had \u201czero chance\u201d of getting his bill through the Republican-controlled Senate. The bill was considered unlikely to pass Congress with so many GOP senators who are likely to oppose it.\nU.S. House Speaker Nikki Haley\u2019s announcement on Christmas Eve of a \u201cdeal\u201d with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on tax reform gave the world pause. Haley said nothing less than what she says she never meant: to give McConnell a \u201cdeal\u201d he does not want. She did not want to make the deal she made or to give McConnell this opportunity to say nothing of the sort, even though she thought that Mitch McConnell was a coward and a hypocrite for refusing her in person during the campaign. As she is a member of parliament, a position she is trying to hold on, she cannot give up her credibility now, and she has already lost the credibility and good standing she had with the nation\u2019s other senators in the debate before Christmas.\nPresident Donald Trump was criticized by fellow Republican senators late Sunday for making a deal with the likes of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelos and Senator Chris Murphy\u2014a deal they say is too weak to get Republicans across the line. But the president can blame it on the media \u2013 who is so critical of him for so much! The media has accused him \u2013 rightfully, we think \u2013 of being an irresponsible, irresponsible person, an irresponsible politician and too much of a bully. He does not like the media\u2019s criticism or, more importantly, he doesn\u2019t think he has any right to criticize them.","token_len":401,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6722,4.971,14.1302,8.9945,11.9622,0.6213,2.3782,3.8146,3.0414,1.929,5.3017,7.098,8.38,6.3967,1.178,3.0543,3.3165,0.3887,3.8632,6.1173,0.0893,1.481,2.9435,1.3178,2.9045,3.5848,3.1378,3.5186,1.377,3.7141,0.4085,1.8777,2.4085,0.1254,9.0193,5.9881,0.3514,5.661,7.2503,3.1464,6.1996,0.8333,2.9153,5.2281,2.6645,6.7288,0.0995,3.757,0.1621,0.5792,0.1153,0.2297,1.286,1.445,1.4469,2.1669,11.4698,0.0769,2.2505,3.3179,0.4384,0.5955,1.2529,3.3126,2.4953,0.473,1.8586,3.091,10.9504,6.2339,7.7034,4.5905,1.323,8.8027,0.7342,2.497,3.0737,1.0915,0.6667,0.6108,4.4985,0.1438,0.3161,1.6645,1.606,3.4241,1.9136,3.2202,5.3813,6.2625,0.814,0.9219,5.3364,4.2687,7.3651,1.288,3.1244,1.1301,4.6669,2.444,4.082,0.1277,2.1817,0.3448,1.0449,0.8402,16.7252,0.0669,0.0057,0.0052,2.2483,1.2865,18.3512,0.0023,3.4584,0.0654,1.6543,4.6821,1.7511,9.6392,1.3752,2.1636,0.9899,10.3184,1.45,7.8894,1.0794,4.2461,1.7839,4.5085,0.0017,0.0146,0.0309,2.7392,3.9049,0.0518,0.1473,0.0011,1.6328,0.0162,0.0623,0.0523,0.1825,3.3019,4.4319,0.698,6.4976,1.8767,6.1864,2.5638,0.8819,5.1758,1.7145,8.4159,6.6114,0.1789,5.9983,1.7837,5.023,2.0293,7.2551,3.819,3.4267,6.1203,4.3651,5.8314,1.8063,9.8805,0.5154,0.8398,0.2613,0.1547,4.3189,5.9542,0.146,1.5136,0.9432,2.8798,3.5401,0.5324,3.9756,0.7323,3.7986,2.2645,3.0538,3.7805,3.9614,6.9896,2.3491,2.8797,1.4071,6.6357,2.2062,0.4182,4.2019,4.2911,2.4,2.0992,5.67,5.2821,3.8339,1.326,1.7494,5.609,2.637,9.1412,0.1668,2.2085,2.999,5.8363,1.9917,2.0648,2.6792,0.0012,1.5258,3.7269,6.2965,5.7798,7.4954,5.2237,0.7825,2.3242,0.5447,4.8066,2.6138,4.99,4.0955,3.2175,0.0128,6.3453,0.4446,5.3161,6.823,1.2505,3.361,6.2736,0.0422,2.2758,2.4009,3.8502,1.0076,3.7867,4.1522,3.3537,1.5286,6.3497,6.0601,2.7272,1.6643,1.2308,2.4776,3.852,2.1958,2.2677,3.9782,4.0678,7.0034,2.4345,1.8604,1.9978,2.8489,1.2504,4.9573,2.8839,0.1934,0.3001,5.8999,2.8293,3.4739,0.9354,7.0487,5.2228,4.7489,0.3885,0.8254,4.7006,1.2907,0.0362,4.2586,4.7704,1.7878,5.3577,2.316,1.2602,6.7073,2.3875,0.9909,4.2514,1.2801,1.9595,0.6323,1.5998,6.7263,0.0036,3.2922,5.1636,0.5592,0.026,19.4137,4.7467,3.4202,4.8857,5.0195,0.5818,5.7851,3.0137,1.1461,3.2536,5.7184,2.1587,3.2809,3.4494,0.9973,4.0418,7.5106,5.2389,0.1883,5.67,1.0221,3.0025,2.1609,1.9839,5.4384,7.0534,3.5692,0.194,1.6297,6.2999,8.1768,3.7154,4.7443,3.792,4.2013,0.0425,2.1729,1.7603,5.0948,1.4459,7.3503,3.0947,1.5735,2.4061,6.0908,1.685,7.9678,7.7364,1.9413,6.1024,3.4006,0.5536,0.0447,1.6832,3.4285,5.2806,2.673,3.3737,3.9427,2.3363,4.7538,2.0335,2.8187,2.4388,5.8085,2.8836,0.8044,0.4248,3.5797,0.793,3.2633,4.8644,0.2367,3.2435,1.8614,1.0705,5.836,0.039,0.0998,2.181,4.4408,4.8478,2.5462,2.0424,0.0821,2.3558,2.1232,2.4205,0.1948,0.0206,4.0907,3.2358,2.2631,2.5974,3.0059,0.2193,1.7038,1.3732,0.8342]}
{"prompt":"Zimbabwe s new president , Emmerson Mnangagwa , on Tuesday announced a three-month amnesty window for the return of public funds illegally stashed abroad by individuals and companies . Upon the expiry of the amnesty","text":"Zimbabwe s new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, on Tuesday announced a three-month amnesty window for the return of public funds illegally stashed abroad by individuals and companies. Upon the expiry of the amnesty period, all properties held by corrupt individuals will be confiscated and sold at their real market value. Mnangagwa\u2019s announcement was made in Zimbabwe\u2019s official countrywide news bulletin and was televised live from state owned television station Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation ( ZBC ) in Harare.\nIn a speech in the ZMC studios, Mnangagwa stated that, \u201cWe will be doing a full clean sweep of our currency board and removing all the criminals from the banking industry and will not tolerate any more hoarding and misuse of our resources. The government will give every responsible individual a chance to return all the stolen property.\u201d \u201cThe government has decided to extend the three-month amnesty window for the return of illegally stashed funds,\u201d Mnangagwa said.\nZimbabwe is a failed state with corruption at its highest level including the country\u2019s current president and vice-president. In the past several months, the government attempted to stop corruption in the country but with little success. This move, is a positive sign by the government that there is change coming to Zimbabwe and it is expected that those who have fled to neighbouring countries will return to their country and get to work.\nPresident Mnangagwa was installed on 30 May 2017, having ousted a military government headed by the long-time vice-president, Robert Mugabe, following a military coup attempt in March. Mnangagwa took the oath of office upon being duly sworn in in a ceremony that was broadcast live at the state-owned television station. The new president announced a state of emergency which is expected to last for five months at a time, stating that his government will be working to eradicate the political, economic, and security problems facing Zimbabwe.","token_len":401,"entropy":[12.6439,10.2365,9.1909,2.1664,1.564,6.7992,0.3282,0.0233,0.0005,0.0006,0.0,0.0001,0.5215,3.5175,2.3597,3.5567,2.1407,4.2723,0.0401,1.5769,4.689,9.8328,0.776,2.5314,7.3257,0.1377,7.7522,3.039,6.2919,6.6815,0.0817,1.3055,3.3009,7.504,1.7091,2.038,1.2599,10.2567,1.9894,4.5847,0.0331,0.0597,0.4117,0.4106,1.2265,0.181,3.4473,7.3321,2.5436,1.4799,6.6867,1.3907,1.7886,0.2228,2.8969,1.1343,4.6171,3.1415,4.8953,7.0965,4.5841,0.8143,0.6275,2.036,0.0057,0.0006,0.0004,14.4059,8.8996,4.0038,2.5551,2.0885,1.7304,1.7058,4.5341,5.2117,0.1662,0.0495,5.3962,6.4074,6.3499,2.3081,4.3324,3.6823,1.4434,6.8226,2.2962,3.0624,5.7417,6.8711,1.2073,2.6908,3.4261,2.7522,2.6002,1.2595,5.9717,0.5727,2.1203,1.8115,3.7198,0.0004,0.576,1.1418,8.3259,1.5694,3.4043,2.5136,1.659,5.5622,5.6109,10.1212,1.261,0.4833,0.013,0.0008,0.0005,3.2195,0.5808,4.088,8.3516,6.2799,5.2899,1.7725,3.4403,3.8976,3.0506,2.7319,7.4374,2.0145,0.5467,2.7306,6.7883,10.0961,1.7704,7.8569,0.9784,2.9951,6.5643,2.0578,1.4296,4.4723,4.1297,2.6868,5.0276,3.4385,3.2415,0.5572,4.2892,7.8143,0.1996,2.1731,4.9579,0.1781,1.0421,4.5999,0.9487,3.0508,2.2107,0.7965,5.0451,3.3446,6.8458,3.4298,1.8473,2.114,0.1794,2.6453,3.5988,2.1849,4.1584,2.3355,2.1418,4.9387,6.787,2.3197,0.5737,2.7507,1.339,2.8423,3.9651,0.452,4.6116,0.6782,4.9654,0.4461,0.0289,0.1061,1.5369,1.9242,1.8361,0.2994,0.0432,6.496,0.5166,0.022,1.1303,2.9295,2.8442,1.6656,11.0396,0.0121,0.0015,0.0007,1.3953,0.4063,0.5835,4.9233,0.0154,2.501,2.0639,7.5056,0.4626,2.0738,4.9314,3.7326,0.6461,3.811,1.4525,6.4826,1.8748,4.582,3.884,0.4608,0.0788,3.6636,3.2305,1.8599,4.9594,1.2356,0.2051,1.5161,2.9096,2.2598,1.6611,3.6538,1.2524,0.2514,1.4547,1.661,6.8481,0.0419,4.6229,2.9509,1.5198,0.6296,0.9776,3.8344,5.0362,2.0925,0.1028,0.3808,4.0446,5.3818,3.6008,6.0776,2.7439,5.6499,1.8751,5.6701,0.6772,0.9033,1.9806,4.0502,0.4883,6.343,2.5408,2.1049,1.8791,2.0409,2.8618,0.9808,3.661,0.3392,6.1296,1.2866,2.2189,4.8968,1.798,3.269,0.3854,0.5399,2.7178,1.3541,1.212,2.2167,2.7628,4.8048,4.0032,0.8729,0.8967,0.7639,5.3508,2.0585,0.0392,0.0048,0.0025,3.7193,8.3846,1.8621,5.5729,2.8311,1.6371,2.586,4.179,8.0907,3.1025,5.6257,2.4113,3.8018,0.0073,2.5372,5.5329,0.57,1.442,6.339,0.2771,0.0837,1.1995,3.6514,0.0068,0.0,1.4855,3.9296,0.9884,3.5325,0.114,4.9406,1.1994,2.3896,2.4686,3.4555,0.0127,0.0028,0.0009,4.7374,3.4019,2.4967,0.0946,0.0085,6.7461,2.939,8.6255,0.4482,0.1654,2.7971,4.404,1.6164,2.6517,1.8101,3.958,0.7664,3.8527,0.7315,3.5609,0.9631,0.6016,1.8003,0.0895,1.8332,1.9584,3.4559,0.5581,3.8449,2.4417,7.5011,0.4246,0.1391,4.4029,3.1067,1.5388,0.0257,1.5586,0.9281,3.4236,1.6236,5.747,2.0355,0.1072,2.0931,7.2019,0.3554,3.6128,1.314,0.7915,2.8774,3.4554,1.1178,3.8081,2.4514,4.9914,2.5633,0.525,1.2224,0.682,2.8872,1.4392,2.6233,0.7663,0.6912]}

The Palestinian Foreign Ministry demanded that an investigation be conducted, accusing Israel of the death of many Palestinian civilians and of carrying out mass deportations as part of its military campaigns.\nIn this episode of The MFA Diaries from the Art Institute of Chicago, I sit down with the amazing Amanda Lee, one of our MFA Program\u2019s first students, currently working at Chicago\u2019s Nitehawk gallery.\nAmanda was born in California. She grew up a very independent kid, with free time to do whatever she wanted, from drawing to painting to dancing to acting. After high school, she moved to Michigan to attend William Jessup College where she majored in Fine Arts and Studio Art. She went on to graduate from the University of Washington in Seattle, where she took classes in painting and drawing.\nOn moving to Chicago, Amanda found a wonderful painting instructor at a local community college who was actually open to taking a couple of unpaid students. To be honored as one of these, Amanda had to study hard and take advantage of all the local art events she could. She has been painting ever since. She works as a fine artist and as the art director for a non-profit that provides art programs for local children.\nAmanda loves finding a balance between working and playing, though if she\u2019s doing anything, it\u2019s painting. She\u2019s also a massive fan of David Lynch movies and music.","token_len":402,"entropy":[8.013,10.3338,0.1624,3.9229,2.127,2.4287,0.2115,1.4821,2.9234,3.3478,1.0533,5.0069,2.6028,7.9695,0.7943,5.0384,5.3628,4.8034,4.8433,1.5932,4.7162,0.0207,3.2567,4.0461,4.3104,6.1653,3.9264,7.4158,6.4246,1.6104,8.414,3.8702,5.2179,1.6661,0.8026,0.3425,15.6,4.0209,1.9633,0.0021,6.7569,0.0001,1.1012,0.0003,0.0,13.743,11.9325,3.2424,2.7296,1.7179,1.4708,3.3083,0.0,9.6986,14.7535,0.4258,1.0928,3.6645,0.3221,3.4884,3.6099,1.7983,3.432,0.0781,4.3823,1.0657,3.1726,0.757,0.3355,2.7378,3.546,0.7165,6.471,1.7745,1.2715,2.1786,3.4096,7.5925,3.1964,1.5865,3.9418,3.6055,2.5475,2.3572,1.138,1.4201,6.1104,0.0024,2.0605,0.2208,10.0804,3.2438,3.2402,3.4503,2.0068,6.2135,0.8498,0.0693,1.7518,0.6353,0.0913,1.9239,2.8175,2.2591,1.5678,2.0124,0.0065,3.1907,0.5092,2.9452,1.9144,6.1295,0.0685,6.705,1.0622,4.456,2.9377,0.3174,1.5692,3.4482,4.6929,0.4714,0.0557,5.5158,5.1149,1.2442,6.6579,2.3937,1.3328,2.4127,1.4648,3.9986,0.0098,2.7935,6.7189,0.0002,5.052,0.8573,0.0007,1.3962,3.3084,4.6879,1.2769,0.174,3.3794,6.2982,7.4015,1.5686,5.5512,8.0725,4.7239,10.9878,0.9769,5.0099,1.5884,10.1836,4.3556,0.2778,2.2196,0.4506,3.7475,5.4268,0.882,0.085,2.7258,8.3521,7.6005,6.1358,1.2629,4.4376,0.0431,4.323,6.1901,0.0025,5.5558,13.5711,1.5988,0.0316,5.8025,4.0239,1.8782,8.1519,2.9175,2.0352,4.1234,9.3337,0.0598,0.1813,7.3249,6.287,5.5227,4.6965,0.4807,1.3911,4.9789,0.0012,3.8705,1.2961,0.655,4.5159,2.459,0.6798,3.182,0.0007,4.8214,6.5022,4.8971,3.8769,1.5366,3.381,7.7459,1.402,2.3812,3.4421,1.7287,0.085,0.1735,1.7727,4.678,5.1134,0.7516,2.5296,1.3447,5.2052,1.2519,4.7363,0.3601,3.7468,2.5336,0.0069,0.6325,0.382,1.9117,0.1589,5.3078,1.4445,2.9956,6.9013,9.3789,0.5165,1.3666,3.3129,0.0968,1.7629,0.0001,0.036,4.3303,0.1391,1.3598,8.7369,1.1972,0.4946,1.5788,3.7592,0.3199,0.015,1.9202,1.5207,1.5315,0.6734,0.0074,4.8153,1.97,1.1335,1.6304,0.4782,0.0468,4.9454,1.9089,0.2925,4.9144,0.7766,3.5201,0.6775,1.1327,4.0494,6.4245,0.3382,0.6959,0.3259,0.2601,3.3959,2.4779,4.4418,7.6947,8.3797,3.5198,2.4102,1.041,5.5532,0.2394,3.4937,2.3755,5.5423,5.9139,0.4696,4.2528,2.9013,5.4984,0.4858,7.3719,5.8159,2.1802,5.9059,3.1276,9.8372,2.3601,2.1705,0.0259,2.9825,6.0143,1.588,2.5007,0.0769,6.6141,3.8729,1.6132,3.3483,5.5888,0.0087,3.2625,0.4792,5.8628,2.9126,5.6903,3.1378,0.413,2.1716,2.0644,4.0264,1.6429,4.7332,2.3894,0.0011,0.7816,2.3454,4.5528,2.7599,0.3377,7.1525,0.9173,1.4692,3.6817,3.8976,4.1273,0.757,1.311,1.634,5.2958,0.0823,0.0329,2.1354,2.6091,2.5925,4.3936,1.1032,4.6056,2.6117,0.8955,0.8427,1.8641,0.0017,5.1432,6.7372,3.8043,5.55,0.2976,4.0027,2.6934,4.1447,1.679,6.4722,6.7884,1.2557,16.4092,0.1497,0.0144,3.8903,2.7356,3.5902,1.1995,1.9363,0.1572,0.0126,7.8414,0.6842,1.1643,4.3409,0.0311,0.0233,3.0765,1.27,6.5364,1.2363,0.0662,7.5719,2.0923,4.3028,1.2371,4.1543,0.906]}

The president and military officials say they have a legal obligation to allow the request regardless of a personnel's gender identity.\nTrump's directive came three weeks after the Pentagon issued a letter saying it would allow the practice under a set of guidelines. In addition, the Pentagon said, it would develop a policy to allow transgender employees \"to voluntarily seek treatment to conform to their biological sex.\"\nOne year ago, the Justice Department issued a memo restricting the use of the Defense of Marriage Act, which the Obama administration had previously upheld to prevent federal courts from preventing religious exemptions from the LGBT nondiscrimination law.\n\"We respect every employee's right, and those of our partners and allies, to express their view on personal social and ethical issues,\" said Matthew Shay, the Pentagon's assistant secretary of defense for personnel policy and readiness. (Supplied: US Defense Department)\nTransgender military personnel have been serving under a non-discrimination policy since 1997, although it has not been fully implemented, so far as known, in the United States.\nIn the past, the policy applied only to all levels of a military, though some military branches have issued their own rules. The Pentagon said in 2016 that the policy was intended to protect \"individual privacy and freedom of conscience\" and protected transgender military members \"from discrimination and harassment on the basis of their sex assigned at birth,\" as well as their gender identity, which could vary from the actual sex of one's body.\nThe Pentagon's letter to the defense secretary said in 2016 - shortly before Trump signed his executive order - that the policy \"was not applicable to the military readiness process or the deployment of military personnel.\"","token_len":402,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,6.2798,1.0504,2.6407,0.0004,1.6967,2.1714,1.9539,13.0532,4.9271,5.1125,4.7567,3.0971,5.9565,0.3262,0.3156,0.6661,2.814,2.0625,1.5769,0.2077,2.0844,4.2963,9.4323,3.1437,0.8987,0.0114,0.776,2.2336,0.196,2.5852,2.757,2.6415,3.6019,4.9045,6.2901,2.8739,0.1808,0.1329,21.3418,3.2216,2.6174,1.3604,6.3637,0.0359,3.692,3.1883,0.5424,1.1824,3.2079,2.8852,0.08,1.5401,4.2858,2.4152,6.1105,7.6242,5.4732,1.4779,0.9485,2.336,2.0592,1.573,4.0704,6.348,2.1158,2.4543,3.4364,4.5356,4.334,1.4581,4.4111,1.8608,2.3467,3.8503,4.1963,1.3899,0.1413,2.7918,2.6684,6.1811,6.4524,0.0931,4.456,5.4557,2.0952,0.2963,0.076,0.5649,0.2054,17.9384,1.1839,2.3448,3.4097,4.8776,1.5256,0.0713,1.7794,0.9017,2.8127,0.6339,4.8677,3.0162,1.5249,0.9516,2.5163,3.4203,5.2587,4.4316,2.2361,5.4999,0.3659,1.8306,1.4278,4.4721,3.6954,0.4416,1.4941,1.5193,1.3688,4.6537,1.2454,0.7957,6.4818,1.1586,1.4355,1.8132,1.6477,0.3535,4.808,4.377,1.5413,6.9514,4.1433,2.8543,4.2388,3.222,0.2599,0.7204,3.8222,0.1716,1.5289,0.211,12.4025,6.1673,0.6276,0.0864,1.5187,6.9325,0.0067,2.7849,0.4786,2.0449,7.274,1.8208,0.8552,0.0316,2.9949,3.8678,5.3075,0.1139,0.0164,1.4937,1.1569,4.3176,1.8449,0.0339,2.1463,3.7327,5.0542,4.2413,3.2909,2.682,2.6327,0.0453,5.5609,6.2322,4.1086,0.9402,2.2726,5.8833,1.4805,0.0001,0.0,0.5342,0.259,0.6286,5.1686,2.6397,6.4492,5.1556,4.9335,0.3939,0.7293,5.1216,1.5943,4.9389,2.022,1.6815,3.4377,1.5636,3.0112,0.6453,0.0665,2.5565,0.2769,4.6874,1.2685,6.6835,7.6895,2.0822,5.8355,0.8925,1.1909,2.0746,4.4184,10.314,0.4818,1.6376,3.8141,0.1388,2.6809,0.464,0.4838,0.7484,0.592,2.7854,3.6394,1.8199,6.7276,0.2641,6.9369,10.1119,0.0328,4.7903,4.5222,3.4093,0.4641,0.2128,0.1188,7.6397,0.0425,2.7155,1.1437,2.3502,1.2719,3.8148,4.3105,2.3805,5.7902,0.086,0.0896,0.2467,0.7016,4.8807,0.9559,4.9516,2.4521,1.1995,1.8262,0.7402,3.5812,0.7572,2.6286,6.8486,2.4156,4.8302,6.0712,0.9335,2.5386,1.2237,1.5389,0.0091,0.3553,0.9087,2.522,2.7598,1.4658,0.7386,1.6104,3.2143,5.1845,0.6857,0.0866,6.3796,10.0194,0.1106,5.2046,1.2647,2.2985,4.1768,1.9508,2.2174,2.3285,1.0748,4.3655,4.9967,0.037,3.2057,1.6072,2.1757,1.6579,2.064,2.0157,4.4483,0.7837,2.4094,0.8102,1.882,3.516,0.2354,2.7475,3.183,3.5234,4.7812,0.8972,3.5869,0.3084,1.9139,1.777,0.9608,7.0787,2.355,2.6197,2.3382,2.8378,0.926,1.1338,1.7133,1.6572,3.3947,0.181,0.1078,0.0028,0.6543,1.9959,4.7023,0.0196,0.0011,4.0502,1.9754,0.286,0.0052,4.076,1.0755,0.2441,2.4655,4.3215,3.6081,3.9711,1.507,3.4992,5.2893,1.2537,1.5459,4.0737,0.5171,3.9238,0.7349,0.2892,1.7916,1.7388,2.3615,4.0066,1.5676,1.7809,4.5511,0.3551,1.9684,4.4041,4.7061,9.2032,5.2688,1.1038,1.39,2.1473,1.7147,1.8562,0.025,0.4001,0.6685,1.4339,0.8003,2.3831,3.2865,1.3952,5.042,0.2661,2.6147,2.2334,6.4519,5.3026,2.428,2.2983,4.1159,0.6137,3.9989,0.4623,1.2748]}

In the bill introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a coalition of U.S. Republicans and Democrats also urged a review by U.S. investment regulators of Chinese acquisitions.\nLast year, Alphabet's $26 billion purchase of U.S. auto maker Waymo Inc. was blocked by a U.S. judge in Oakland. Two weeks ago Waymo said it would move most of its employees to a new headquarters in Phoenix and that its self-driving unit would remain in California and build its software in Boulder, Colo. The purchase of the self-driving company was among the biggest acquisition in U.S. history by a foreign company.\nThe latest proposal on Wednesday is not the first time U.S companies have faced foreign acquisitions scrutiny under the administration of President Donald Trump. In July, the Trump administration put forward new legislation to limit U.S. government funding for companies that conduct or support foreign military transactions.\nIn July, a U.S. judge blocked in a significant part the Google deal with Waymo. That deal would have seen the two companies merge to become one giant.\nWaymo, which does not own the vehicles that it runs in Arizona (Uber does) but works with auto companies to build self-driving cars in their development labs, has been moving to separate its software from its car building operations.\nUber, like many other companies, uses self-driving tech at most of its markets and it has built a large software and algorithms department. Waymo has an enormous base in Arizona, where Uber does not.\nWaymo has stated that it has spent billions of dollars on self-driving technology since it began developing the technology in 2011. It spends millions on research and development every year.","token_len":402,"entropy":[11.9207,1.3415,0.2228,2.2405,3.2872,1.5309,2.8654,0.0009,0.006,0.0386,1.6681,2.6771,0.2992,0.9575,0.0019,3.4977,3.9229,2.068,1.5041,1.0518,5.6764,0.002,5.173,0.0009,0.0039,0.0051,5.5968,4.243,1.6386,6.2196,2.1494,1.9869,1.2224,3.3435,4.2906,0.0306,5.2368,0.8739,0.0004,0.0024,0.2421,7.5003,0.1555,0.1742,1.0647,0.5605,6.0851,1.7342,3.4404,3.0303,0.7354,1.3984,0.0016,2.3336,0.1182,0.0,1.2662,0.2888,0.0061,0.0204,0.0441,2.5752,6.0619,0.0616,2.8896,0.0003,0.0019,0.2184,5.7746,1.2287,0.7614,5.2199,4.0342,3.5812,2.7139,4.644,3.4776,0.0005,0.0065,0.0015,5.9629,1.1503,0.9558,2.4191,4.468,1.2952,0.4624,21.5524,1.4151,0.1992,7.9368,3.663,3.3773,5.0996,0.5345,2.6245,0.0209,3.389,0.008,0.004,0.443,5.3913,0.6217,5.6879,0.0235,3.2583,0.3716,2.4305,3.5475,0.3254,1.7603,1.0817,0.0003,0.0075,0.0037,2.3171,1.4598,6.8853,1.7525,5.5594,3.0416,1.6611,8.8865,0.002,2.7879,0.2727,0.8226,4.3185,8.167,0.1094,0.1219,5.5024,0.571,3.663,1.7003,2.3932,0.1726,6.3839,2.7782,2.8629,2.6368,6.623,0.0013,0.1141,7.4325,0.9987,3.978,0.6993,1.7947,3.508,6.2765,2.3698,4.9602,2.3183,8.6364,0.6036,0.4283,0.3142,3.0319,6.1998,1.7298,3.1376,5.3057,0.0004,0.0009,3.5164,2.0915,5.7288,1.3817,2.239,6.1624,1.9981,0.605,0.0002,0.0007,0.0055,0.5253,2.4296,1.977,4.5576,0.6683,0.8177,0.356,5.4985,5.0017,3.9999,5.0482,1.6144,2.9922,4.4217,1.4675,0.2881,0.5427,2.5508,0.0004,0.0007,10.985,0.1741,4.0036,5.3649,5.4078,7.6866,5.048,1.0231,6.5231,0.2398,0.3196,0.7756,0.0058,0.1707,1.716,3.1378,0.12,1.8345,2.8573,0.2664,5.6467,1.9591,3.9911,2.9363,1.2923,3.7307,1.7876,0.0002,0.0015,0.1054,3.0476,3.354,0.9612,2.9313,0.902,5.2971,3.9402,3.9433,3.0459,2.6921,7.9381,0.4779,0.7017,2.7146,3.2093,0.1054,2.7729,1.8287,0.0002,0.0107,0.006,2.2862,2.5001,7.2543,1.4394,9.4286,3.3467,4.874,6.784,2.3496,3.39,7.7716,0.0017,1.9287,3.0661,4.7971,3.8231,0.1902,5.7359,1.465,4.5685,0.4715,2.6731,2.084,3.3751,3.1995,4.043,3.5437,1.1523,7.2892,0.004,2.3737,0.7176,5.2763,0.9443,2.1462,1.9593,7.1133,2.6035,3.9394,4.0848,1.8596,4.7592,7.3525,7.1785,4.6027,2.2538,4.1719,4.9072,1.0228,7.7637,2.1514,2.0398,2.2963,3.092,0.0012,0.0006,1.0363,2.4787,5.1678,8.2538,1.5472,0.3279,2.0539,1.5951,6.4196,2.9846,7.0553,2.1855,4.7596,0.5795,0.7701,4.7819,5.9514,1.9789,0.8184,1.0688,5.8002,2.3594,5.2003,3.3795,1.0124,2.0824,0.4831,4.1467,3.0931,0.0006,0.0055,3.6463,5.6036,8.6912,1.9525,0.0522,8.3752,2.4259,4.9077,1.1847,4.4719,1.8062,3.1733,4.0999,2.7451,9.6774,4.2781,2.6718,2.2605,0.0082,1.9638,5.3187,5.3834,5.0366,2.5957,2.6855,0.8584,1.5021,3.395,4.8827,1.6096,0.5186,0.7012,4.2097,0.0063,2.2953,7.4239,0.7424,0.5112,2.5047,5.2421,3.916,0.5278,0.005,1.4003,2.4493,0.0007,0.0005,0.8983,2.6381,1.4077,1.8004,2.5516,1.3509,0.7936,0.7421,2.5378,0.3456,2.9291,7.6645,4.042,2.0427,1.9097,0.4714,0.0868,5.086,0.1223,1.3811]}

The inspector general said it dropped the probe after he decided to dismiss a \u201ccredibly false\u201d letter Zinke wrote to Murkowski. His office decided to do so after he realized the threat was \u201cnot the basis for a warrantless search of the inspector general \u2019 s personal property.\u201d The inspector general said the letter did not violate the rules and regulations of the Department of the Interior. A representative for Murkowski could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe Justice Department has issued a request for proposals to the FBI to purchase the necessary equipment to track and track terrorists, according to government sources. The federal agency announced on Thursday that it would launch a Request for Proposal process to find a vendor willing to produce state-of-the-art surveillance equipment for law enforcement agencies, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. The request is for a small pool of four or five vendors in order for the FBI to gain early and competitive pricing on a set of technologies that the agency will need to track and track suspected terrorists and their associates, according to sources.\nThe Justice Department is seeking bids from software, hardware, communications, and other firms, according to the sources. The Department of Justice told Congress in a 2013 budget report that it hopes to build what it calls an \u201cintelligence backbone\u201d that is an advanced system for tracking mobile communications. The system is intended to collect and analyze data on calls, text messages, e-mails and other online communications as well as GPS coordinates. The law enforcement agency wants to improve surveillance capabilities in an area where it has been thwarted by the technology, according to a memo reviewed by Reuters.

A plan written in advance and it is ready to go.\"\nFroome, who has said he could be ready for the Tour de France in an outright sprint from the front after training over the winter, also looked ahead to next summer.","token_len":404,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,8.4766,9.9559,0.133,6.49,2.821,0.1701,0.9368,0.015,0.0002,6.3756,4.7825,2.0289,0.3231,3.6174,3.6015,0.4515,0.598,1.5999,0.3999,1.3005,4.7377,0.3844,2.2363,1.9271,0.0991,2.8578,4.0091,0.0142,0.2023,3.99,0.4848,3.2784,1.4192,3.1685,0.0007,5.5268,1.277,5.4183,0.596,0.0273,2.5437,0.1731,5.1327,1.3286,0.2761,0.9941,2.1558,2.1242,1.6582,10.069,6.1219,6.6862,1.4977,11.7409,1.8532,23.675,6.3114,3.3476,11.1497,3.711,8.4338,10.7968,11.6626,4.5694,2.0607,2.0893,5.0549,7.518,4.9432,3.0511,0.8295,18.1555,7.7418,2.3686,3.6132,5.1802,5.513,6.4392,3.5325,0.0832,2.0754,8.6266,2.7547,2.6847,2.1631,10.2159,4.3036,3.8178,6.2457,0.9635,1.4322,7.4647,0.6996,5.8005,4.0302,8.1726,7.2944,2.1911,3.0329,0.0001,3.1195,2.2292,2.9273,3.7752,5.9525,3.0244,1.9136,6.2433,2.0169,5.6797,3.2091,1.2868,4.6352,3.8207,6.5699,5.3902,1.6543,1.4682,1.885,0.0839,0.006,7.6991,6.9497,1.6781,0.7948,1.9248,4.7037,5.6177,3.4367,5.3498,12.7987,2.8066,0.4394,5.5351,7.0989,2.4255,3.6702,0.0944,3.8028,0.0614,6.9314,8.068,2.1607,1.3826,1.2066,5.0338,3.3007,1.393,5.1001,3.0519,2.4513,0.0377,0.1507,4.7228,2.7768,3.8288,4.7669,5.5123,2.8728,1.0673,7.2358,0.9659,5.9765,6.5312,1.7773,1.1068,7.2802,7.9084,0.9912,1.2562,7.0003,2.3978,5.2273,6.6314,5.4549,3.2953,2.7474,3.4758,1.1515,2.3594,5.5728,7.344,1.4045,0.4181,4.6191,5.6905,2.8052,1.513,1.6658,1.9077,2.6463,7.7885,0.4976,2.3688,2.1295,2.2653,1.3438,0.1579,3.8344,1.8961,3.363,1.8676,4.0648,3.5888,0.8215,5.1945,7.8312,4.1176,9.306,0.5567,0.0489,0.0959,0.0012,3.4774,1.8396,5.173,3.8586,7.0519,5.5401,0.0105,0.8511,0.0099,0.0036,0.0001,3.0206,3.3557,3.7682,1.8024,2.3443,0.9847,7.8861,2.8921,1.1081,5.9385,0.364,0.019,2.6276,7.1295,0.3713,0.002,2.1782,3.025,6.6792,4.9417,1.3677,1.9158,6.6572,1.9891,4.1766,0.6468,0.3573,0.0016,5.5662,5.8436,1.5636,3.8354,1.2616,0.0884,0.252,1.8733,0.3202,2.0677,2.5555,0.0517,0.8781,6.8807,0.9423,3.5265,0.2039,0.0195,4.0789,6.0811,1.9287,1.8177,6.5712,7.3558,2.1908,3.9956,8.6832,2.6495,1.291,6.3124,0.0078,0.2455,1.1566,4.2475,2.6473,5.5706,6.7072,0.7611,3.5553,4.1616,7.1352,1.148,0.0032,0.4518,0.9427,0.5293,3.8993,1.9179,4.3614,2.4525,2.1673,3.9689,1.943,1.4795,4.1795,2.5222,0.4119,2.8136,0.7379,1.9181,5.6029,1.7961,4.1369,2.1971,4.2543,0.498,1.588,1.8705,1.7203,3.4706,5.3877,2.0386,3.7187,4.9184,2.8828,1.4608,2.9504,4.4822,3.0602,0.4218,1.0481,4.5745,1.5905,4.6886,7.0496,4.4122,1.2773,1.1358,8.906,1.3657,1.2904,3.6194,2.2589,1.645,1.5497,0.3152,0.7723,0.0096,0.8391,5.5449,2.8944,9.2837,1.2907,4.6597,2.8937,3.2611,1.5722,3.9683,1.6374,0.3204,1.8388,0.3705,2.0716,0.0278,0.0056,2.8803,0.6361,2.1485,5.358,0.3472,5.085,3.2227,3.1839,1.1154,0.6281,0.9231,0.9887,0.0194,1.7244,5.1081,9.697,0.7897,4.6612,1.1916,4.1156,4.4506,5.5728,7.3044,0.1344,4.1042,0.3505,3.9288,5.9533,3.8757,0.1366,3.7082,3.5132,2.3127]}
{"prompt":"Romania s lower house of parliament , which is dominated by the ruling Social Democrats , approved a bill on Monday that will change the way magistrates are supervised and which critics say threatens judicial","text":"Romania s lower house of parliament, which is dominated by the ruling Social Democrats, approved a bill on Monday that will change the way magistrates are supervised and which critics say threatens judicial independence. A new law on independent judges, drafted by lawmakers, is due to be approved by the Romanian Senate next week. The new law came into effect on Monday morning, and the first applications submitted to the new Independent Judges Service were received by Tuesday. \" The new law gives all the powers in the service to the president, rather than to a separate council, and introduces some serious violations of the constitution, \" said Ion Pana, an analyst in the liberal opposition ANEA party. Under the new law a judge's case will be referred immediately to a higher court if he or she \" commits a serious infraction, \" although it remains unclear what these are. Mr. Pana said that the independent judges service had been overrun with applications to be transferred. The draft law sets up an independent commission to select and appoint prosecutors, with the president and the president of the Supreme Court, who is also the chair of the commission, as its chief appointors, but the president of the Republic remains the chief judge for criminal cases. The new law stipulates that prosecutors may work only in their districts of origin. It requires that judges who seek promotions to senior positions in the judiciary be given a chance to \" make their candidacies public, \" and that all transfers made by judges must be approved by the service. The law comes into force on April 1, a day Mr. Nastase has already announced he plans to attend the opening of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. Mr. Nastase, who was the prime minister before he lost the last election to Mr. Mihai R\u0103tianu in March 2002, intends to push the independent judges law through parliament as soon as possible, so that his new ministry can begin its new work on April 1, as required by law.","token_len":404,"entropy":[6.8072,9.599,11.6589,1.2188,0.3986,0.162,1.442,2.4159,1.7985,3.5592,0.014,0.8433,1.6394,3.0925,1.2338,0.6334,6.6695,1.1373,1.5692,1.5049,2.2345,0.9818,2.4105,4.9253,0.627,2.899,11.2332,0.0398,1.9242,6.0228,2.7338,4.8763,5.5172,0.494,4.637,4.986,0.1168,0.3084,5.9209,4.0673,1.3675,3.4113,8.3387,1.5683,2.5516,4.554,0.3579,4.8093,1.9623,2.4042,1.7334,0.2052,0.3653,2.993,0.8214,1.1047,4.3781,3.0275,2.6012,0.6656,0.2388,2.1648,2.7235,0.4824,6.477,0.9756,0.7362,0.6135,2.2633,3.3764,1.2939,2.3831,2.1576,4.1188,8.0182,6.1076,1.5382,0.6031,4.1025,8.8362,2.5586,4.8674,2.7005,3.2829,0.9999,2.612,0.822,3.4751,9.0174,1.9273,0.7099,4.143,4.9146,3.1307,1.8611,3.8722,0.3502,6.9686,1.4241,1.4461,4.0495,1.4608,7.0843,0.0027,1.5341,2.481,6.3156,3.8476,2.0308,1.5282,6.4414,4.5453,4.1957,8.3119,0.4546,0.8747,2.5392,2.4354,7.7899,0.6264,8.1256,4.7521,8.1941,0.7939,2.7666,3.3977,3.9102,0.327,5.826,3.9153,9.3879,6.6785,1.628,0.5622,6.6328,0.178,0.4778,0.2562,5.3886,1.2381,2.525,6.8009,1.3206,0.4686,4.3127,7.1079,0.2096,1.3109,4.2673,0.5604,3.2706,1.9206,0.9947,0.0079,3.4356,8.102,1.012,1.339,5.8246,0.0236,1.8313,1.8241,6.1908,2.5207,3.6179,0.82,2.3653,4.946,3.1648,0.4489,5.0037,1.0412,0.4963,0.0018,0.6309,1.228,1.4693,6.2686,0.3267,2.6975,3.2251,1.1735,10.0887,1.31,4.477,3.5587,2.666,3.3134,3.2089,1.92,6.0767,0.3972,5.8574,1.6555,2.2455,0.341,2.7044,1.1456,6.7241,3.451,2.311,6.8269,1.3274,4.9553,1.3278,3.2731,2.4984,1.3051,2.842,5.0846,0.1569,3.465,0.1589,2.3164,2.5905,3.4608,2.5488,1.7061,4.6281,1.086,0.115,1.1897,0.4835,3.1689,4.1806,3.0808,6.0454,6.2026,2.3773,3.1461,2.1555,2.7923,3.8553,0.0978,7.4846,5.6478,2.1651,3.1917,1.4845,4.8436,8.2484,0.7325,0.3901,1.299,1.6663,0.5067,6.1711,0.0035,0.1435,3.5599,3.5842,5.6187,2.5114,1.6542,4.17,4.4885,2.9056,3.8134,2.072,3.2863,4.8876,1.3539,2.4981,2.6089,6.1062,6.0935,1.8675,4.7318,0.6389,1.8011,0.9422,1.3701,2.3692,3.8015,2.0677,3.4319,0.1471,5.1939,7.8379,2.06,7.8897,1.5048,0.6344,2.5649,1.8971,2.208,1.3175,3.8435,7.3635,4.1534,2.3809,2.0496,3.1683,0.5848,1.3944,0.1593,0.4935,8.8773,1.276,1.3547,2.5187,5.6755,0.848,1.4384,0.5393,3.193,1.2588,0.9528,3.738,0.4459,8.1364,0.0009,6.2631,2.5991,3.8822,4.0273,2.5951,3.0651,1.7158,3.3436,0.017,4.5836,1.1374,3.329,0.3039,0.9056,4.3742,2.3203,0.0969,0.2622,0.0015,1.2582,0.3913,0.0008,1.5917,1.7139,0.6992,2.2049,0.0047,0.2208,0.0007,0.0044,2.0357,0.6521,2.2894,3.1578,4.5,0.0281,3.491,1.7848,3.4629,1.2426,4.7489,1.4135,1.63,1.5924,0.0005,5.5332,2.6979,1.0833,7.0617,5.0818,0.0965,4.1,4.1157,4.1644,1.5347,2.8173,7.1633,0.0492,7.4174,0.0292,5.8897,2.5007,7.5043,0.422,3.5227,0.6645,0.9412,3.3362,0.8165,0.001,0.4745,1.8018,5.5149,0.6231,3.6554,4.8382,5.5241,1.064,3.2773,3.3597,5.1117,1.9834,2.6337,5.0762,0.3873,2.0728,3.808,4.8121,0.3572,0.8818,0.132]}
{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump has interviewed several top prospects for the post of Chair of the Federal Reserve . A nomination could come within weeks as the term of current Chair Janet Yellen ends in","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump has interviewed several top prospects for the post of Chair of the Federal Reserve. A nomination could come within weeks as the term of current Chair Janet Yellen ends in late February.\nThere is a lot of attention on the possible arrival of new Fed Chair this week as some analysts believe that Mr Trump could choose a woman for the post.\nAccording to reports in the Wall Street Journal, Mr Trump has interviewed the current vice chair of the Federal Reserve, Richard Fisher, as well as four other candidates. The Journal said that Mr Trump has also made some preliminary judgements about the people he wants on a future Fed policy-making team.\nTrump has reportedly asked the vice chair of the Fed to help design regulations or standards for companies. He also said he wanted Richard Fischer\u2019s deputy, Dennis Lockhart, to be the next head of the Treasury Department, according to the Journal. The Wall Street Journal claimed that Mr Fisher is a top candidate for the Fed post and that the Republican candidate may select a woman for the post.\nThe Financial Times, meanwhile, said that Fed Chair Janet Yellen could announce today that she will resign after the end of her term in February. Yellen announced in January that she will hand over the reins to Jerome Powell, while her term has only just completed her one year.\nYellen was elected to the Fed in 2013 and she has served as the director of research for the bank. In February 2017, she was appointed by President Obama as the first female chair of the Fed.\nEarlier this week, Mr Trump named Ms Yellen as a member of his National Economic Council.\nYellen resigned on 29 January in an abrupt and outlandishly early departure that was not the subject of any discussions on the board at the Federal Reserve. After her departure, the U.S. Central Bank\u2019s chairman, Jerome Powell, called Ms Yellen a \u201ctremendous asset and a giant in the American economy\u201d.","token_len":406,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,2.9623,10.1117,3.0773,3.2558,7.9553,0.691,0.8069,3.8013,2.3652,10.422,0.3524,0.2732,2.6944,0.2768,1.7031,4.5454,6.1388,2.7153,2.1363,3.1124,1.3187,4.0773,1.3718,7.3637,1.6668,4.3388,1.3601,1.5306,0.0055,0.0,4.7608,2.4946,3.8478,3.4194,0.4789,0.4814,17.2984,1.3432,2.0158,2.8554,0.516,6.8675,0.934,1.0627,4.666,7.3615,0.052,4.9769,1.8083,1.0003,9.328,1.6058,2.164,4.243,3.2062,3.5951,1.577,4.601,2.5888,1.5466,4.5493,2.1267,5.313,3.3245,0.5552,1.5708,0.7457,0.7747,4.9881,0.0051,3.9151,2.3203,1.0296,1.5238,0.0031,0.0022,0.3427,1.9332,0.246,1.2516,4.9571,4.0926,3.9468,6.5524,0.5536,0.8208,0.1414,0.4223,0.1415,1.3252,4.4877,3.8905,0.3374,2.7868,0.2935,0.0088,4.2107,0.9828,1.9022,1.2478,2.5424,2.6702,2.7591,1.13,1.2533,0.1932,1.338,1.2415,4.2457,3.8564,4.4156,8.3875,0.0046,0.9298,1.4211,6.5878,1.3471,1.9904,4.0942,4.2869,3.4132,1.4911,6.0029,3.4938,0.323,0.773,0.3874,0.3395,6.5944,1.6269,4.0593,2.5168,2.1722,5.3089,0.1701,1.0453,0.0834,1.9318,0.8846,4.0873,5.2505,7.7268,5.514,8.1171,0.8209,6.4734,2.0585,3.2313,2.0012,3.3297,1.1691,3.1033,8.3603,5.6447,14.2332,9.2409,4.8201,4.4989,2.1454,7.5946,5.6791,0.4726,0.5336,0.4161,1.205,1.6321,1.7457,3.6121,0.0655,0.1629,5.2856,0.4991,2.3136,1.9237,0.0041,1.2584,0.4338,0.1884,3.2229,3.5628,0.0031,0.0007,6.0332,0.3651,0.4713,3.5989,2.0477,2.3912,4.0515,1.5943,0.7794,0.575,3.8998,2.1188,2.5811,1.3124,2.3241,5.1139,3.1281,4.2483,5.6716,1.9862,1.7415,2.0003,0.4476,0.6055,0.5801,0.3939,1.7146,5.7447,0.076,3.6452,4.0989,0.0373,2.3018,0.616,5.2828,1.122,0.3069,0.0015,0.0001,2.5986,4.5011,4.7691,0.3889,0.4895,0.8608,2.6783,2.7198,1.8574,1.6405,0.0008,1.3965,0.3275,2.4095,1.9224,0.512,4.771,0.001,4.3528,2.1527,2.2433,0.1306,0.1649,2.3414,6.9272,0.865,1.4396,1.7561,1.1822,6.1085,0.0081,1.1259,5.8837,4.0635,3.7008,3.5082,4.8482,2.0105,6.7011,6.5679,6.0665,0.4443,2.6633,0.9869,4.299,0.0015,2.9572,4.252,1.2907,0.6954,1.4962,0.7535,3.3347,1.7749,3.6291,1.1775,2.763,1.1589,1.6068,6.2258,0.4175,5.2423,2.0611,0.5233,3.3986,2.8055,3.1686,3.3694,3.1061,0.3294,0.8726,1.9158,1.437,1.9379,0.4867,3.2027,1.7639,0.8117,1.4848,0.556,2.2165,0.3487,0.0495,1.9063,0.2748,1.2224,5.292,0.3685,1.5402,0.1822,2.5371,0.1043,4.9251,4.6377,0.5501,0.0002,0.6808,3.3811,3.5683,0.0039,0.911,5.1601,0.0405,0.0004,0.7719,1.6429,4.6946,0.0037,5.2488,2.3372,7.4941,1.8807,3.8288,2.3195,3.6321,3.4884,6.9839,9.6135,0.006,7.8103,1.4294,2.732,2.6843,3.6373,4.712,5.9054,0.0083,2.5922,5.7314,3.6042,0.816,4.8608,3.2532,0.5314,5.7745,0.3095,0.7456,4.9617,2.3485,1.7522,0.3146,1.5562,4.4952,0.0009,0.0035,0.0071,4.3666,0.1833,11.6102,2.0893,0.2295,3.57,0.6522,2.7866,0.0156,0.6195,3.9434,2.4886,0.0367,0.0002,1.5997,15.1836,4.684,4.0235,3.3909,0.0022,0.1527,2.324,2.753,2.5424,8.8078,2.3364,0.7503,4.7715,0.5626,3.09,7.509,1.6281]}

I love little girls shoes, but you just cant find any at any price. I love wearing my daughter\u0092s older shoes, but my current ones are really worn out.\nI am not sure if I am the only one with an overactive imagination but this makes me think of the kind of world where all men wear dresses. The women of my world wear skirts and tops even though I am a guy and it makes me wonder what the women would do if they all lost the ability to dress themselves as well. It is certainly possible for a group of men to wear dresses together.\nThis image was taken at an outdoor event a few years ago. I was there because my husband was a speaker, not because I wanted to catch the event but simply because he was there. I loved the dresses the women were wearing. They were very pretty, but, as always in photo shoots, they were posed. They were very photogenic, but there were not much else to them. Their costumes reflected the season that was in place yet the women wore a bit of everything- the blouses just look like ordinary blouses to me, the dresses are not beautiful but nor are they very distinctive, the make-up was done for a make-it-or-break-it type of event- that kind of thing. The women\u2019s pose was forced by the occasion.","token_len":406,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,8.3714,4.5398,1.738,4.9923,2.039,5.5137,0.2366,0.4314,4.9104,3.8408,4.3896,2.5978,1.1146,5.3475,3.2744,0.002,0.0048,0.0015,5.1543,2.0284,0.0411,0.7169,0.8723,3.9628,0.5065,1.2889,2.2111,0.0153,1.271,0.6165,0.6627,4.1998,0.0411,1.7799,3.5587,16.9852,6.8357,10.0496,1.2405,0.1621,2.4798,8.4885,5.5167,4.9587,8.3408,2.7788,5.2635,8.3725,2.0343,4.8247,4.6161,2.1163,6.3171,1.5327,2.7797,2.1136,2.0304,3.6566,0.6072,7.8234,0.7323,4.1316,5.9229,2.254,5.7058,0.6783,1.5113,4.7505,0.5589,3.6201,7.8362,1.1351,4.6873,2.2315,3.1544,1.666,5.4044,1.9019,2.8063,4.0302,1.4689,0.8929,0.294,3.7572,3.144,1.637,5.2344,3.4356,1.7433,3.7251,1.1953,3.7756,3.6354,11.0438,9.5235,9.1054,0.1624,11.4696,1.364,0.0003,0.0013,0.0023,0.3616,0.1103,0.0009,5.0937,4.334,9.0631,2.1809,0.8988,2.6228,2.7321,8.5708,1.2938,11.7997,5.72,4.6226,6.5333,3.6172,2.669,1.3598,10.9036,4.8621,2.0848,4.6082,7.3079,4.5522,12.5908,1.6866,2.5082,4.0974,4.552,5.6835,3.7466,3.0928,5.9544,4.156,3.5087,1.3121,1.8896,2.9982,5.9343,2.9947,5.432,11.5917,9.712,1.1642,9.0543,4.2525,1.4209,0.6063,5.9362,7.0513,4.7943,0.7362,4.9971,4.0155,1.2028,0.91,3.4959,1.9956,2.9349,2.7356,1.9908,1.2749,1.6833,2.2347,3.526,0.7072,0.529,3.5346,3.3458,5.8056,3.3857,0.4362,4.6808,2.9941,5.2056,0.4507,2.268,1.8051,1.9778,6.3282,0.044,5.6545,2.1236,4.3145,3.8586,5.0463,4.0609,2.1841,3.6912,4.5169,3.5447,2.4765,2.8388,3.7619,3.8331,1.7517,5.5298,6.4991,1.1309,1.7595,1.3942,2.1743,5.3566,1.6822,3.6959,2.4962,0.3207,1.9363,1.9822,2.5279,4.399,3.5241,1.9723,0.8365,0.7645,6.0945,6.7925,3.6567,3.3309,0.0339,3.2062,3.919,5.0093,3.0488,0.6718,3.4892,1.3466,6.0812,2.7423,2.5399,1.4699,5.8364,0.2377,1.5272,0.4185,2.7897,1.6684,6.5392,2.2865,1.5371,3.2547,6.5945,2.7952,1.3874,2.9144,2.8516,3.9358,2.6868,5.6457,0.5682,0.8459,0.261,1.1875,1.7534,2.3017,2.7159,4.4569,2.9527,2.8269,1.6474,3.0174,6.6106,3.02,3.0877,0.3782,1.0606,3.089,0.2279,7.0592,2.8647,4.4363,3.2807,4.7542,0.5524,2.0152,1.1477,2.6257,1.2154,1.5766,5.551,1.6302,7.3555,5.3629,2.8543,2.4843,0.1128,1.1884,2.543,0.6161,3.6276,4.1681,1.5719,2.274,6.3804,2.7306,4.2666,4.5623,7.8853,2.6904,0.3574,1.3651,0.7885,9.0338,3.9977,3.0695,0.682,2.6602,7.9201,0.064,1.762,1.3883,3.7547,1.291,4.1657,3.7577,2.6052,1.1848,3.9274,0.5039,5.0742,5.3871,7.075,1.1699,6.7747,3.9985,2.4075,2.5334,4.7896,7.1274,2.7748,2.2474,2.302,3.819,4.8117,1.4839,4.5836,8.2281,3.7006,6.0487,0.8565,9.0563,4.662,2.0815,7.4538,2.1588,0.0538,4.5879,0.0751,1.8572,2.1539,3.2986,4.2522,3.1591,6.1395,2.3536,10.7486,1.5966,0.3236,3.2572,7.65,2.4443,2.3875,7.5343,0.7808,0.0094,1.6474,4.0344,4.3342,2.52,9.068,0.4056,10.7872,0.8565,7.2754,0.0015,0.6956,0.1968,0.0128,2.6795,0.6127,2.4461,4.7284,4.1758,4.2011,0.0021,0.9696,0.3503,2.7893,1.9544,11.5538,7.1816,1.2041,8.1538,1.0087,10.1979,2.5641,0.7709,8.0041,1.6058]}

Argentina ,","text":"Seven Latin American governments said on Wednesday that they supported the decision by Honduras electoral tribunal to proceed with a total recount of disputed ballots in the country s Nov. 28 election. Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico and the nder-secretaries general of Central American governments supported the process, which was triggered following a series of complaints submitted by Podemos candidate Salvador Nasralla. The commission, which oversees the elections in Honduras, gave the all-clear to start a verification process after a petition was filed on Dec. 18. On Wednesday, the commission asked Honduran authorities to take all precautionary measures to ensure it can work properly during the verification processes and to ensure that the electoral process could be carried out in a transparent, free and fair manner. I ntenational election observer mission for the Central and South American region released a statement, which includes a letter signed by the nder-secretaries general urging the Honduran authorities to give adequate guarantees to the observers. \u201c This request is the formal expression of the will of Central, South, and South- Western American democracies, seeking that the Honduran authorities guarantee the observance of these processes, as this has not happened in previous experiences,\u201d the signatories said in the document. They referred to the reports of various sources that the total of unverified ballots may be in the tens of millions. \u201cWe demand that the authorities provide all guarantees that guarantee the observance of the verification process,\u201d the statement said. The observers also want assurances that the new verification process should not last longer than it was originally planned. In October, the commission announced that it planned a total recount of the 9 million ballots in the presidential elections. Honduras has a history of controversial elections, which have sometimes even been called fraudulent. That election was contested. The ruling National Party of Honduras, headed by Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, accused the opposition party, the Movement Democratic Alliance (Moldavita ) of rigging the election by voting irregularly and improperly printing ballots.","token_len":406,"entropy":[10.5172,1.5462,5.4014,6.2351,3.0276,1.808,0.8295,0.8842,5.4469,1.4337,3.8206,2.2161,5.7177,12.2055,4.6876,0.8938,5.8373,0.3444,1.3965,7.5231,3.1034,1.0587,7.2852,0.8778,1.5714,0.9437,3.3183,12.8588,9.6707,0.0381,6.7312,1.5121,0.3743,8.4509,1.2235,2.4265,0.5325,5.4768,0.8527,3.1565,12.13,7.8358,3.9486,9.2156,4.4305,7.1964,0.2714,6.1366,1.1402,4.0283,4.942,0.3016,4.3505,1.5485,2.1124,1.9795,5.3831,4.6022,1.0664,3.8128,0.0006,4.7867,5.5968,0.546,8.004,0.0258,0.0012,7.1295,2.9452,3.4938,0.1044,0.6399,0.9359,2.5028,6.5974,2.4719,0.8127,4.5442,1.1625,1.9636,1.8817,1.952,0.1829,6.0301,1.4324,7.4231,0.2099,1.6249,1.153,6.8829,2.1252,9.5681,0.3307,3.9806,2.2508,5.1649,1.7691,1.6763,2.9347,3.9795,0.008,3.6027,1.1499,5.4575,1.2034,0.1963,1.1449,2.364,4.7947,3.8021,0.0553,2.1235,0.2241,3.9806,2.9772,8.3436,0.2832,0.1608,0.8468,0.8502,4.6521,3.0236,6.1799,4.617,5.1516,0.4249,4.7086,6.5255,3.0675,1.7499,1.4638,0.9539,1.2947,3.7216,1.9815,5.2342,0.9099,3.4979,0.011,1.7237,0.8402,3.1899,2.6824,5.1175,0.1273,0.3004,0.3784,0.3283,8.0096,8.3289,9.1191,7.4071,5.4885,7.813,7.119,5.1947,1.3464,2.8137,5.5412,0.5553,0.1653,4.9833,6.7663,0.5105,0.4052,3.2618,3.059,6.6303,1.47,4.1223,4.7185,0.0305,2.1213,6.9551,0.2131,0.2753,0.0442,0.188,0.7687,8.3277,0.9813,0.863,0.0409,0.8196,0.0808,5.1258,5.383,4.8338,1.5348,1.3749,3.9613,1.4693,10.4972,7.5503,5.3471,5.37,1.475,3.7352,6.7849,5.5066,0.0383,1.1299,6.1774,0.0656,6.6286,4.3464,0.1,2.3407,0.216,3.3825,4.2008,9.2146,5.4311,5.5039,2.1203,5.8209,6.1111,1.3071,1.6806,0.0376,0.7188,6.4458,1.0234,6.4731,0.0284,0.136,4.9925,6.4883,1.8545,2.7532,6.9757,4.33,3.8263,2.3836,1.3552,3.5362,9.4412,2.1751,7.8782,6.8121,3.5103,8.2173,0.1173,2.1594,2.2863,1.1007,5.1999,0.2769,3.1441,6.4723,0.209,0.7973,6.7102,0.9564,5.5881,6.3664,2.1321,1.9158,8.0766,3.1205,6.5287,1.7023,0.5238,4.4357,1.2084,3.7836,1.0283,2.3751,0.1783,1.9168,1.376,2.8388,0.3517,8.9967,4.1154,0.6228,0.6074,4.5902,3.1307,3.1281,4.1975,2.1907,5.9347,0.5746,2.4113,0.0028,0.0843,0.7388,4.3518,0.9009,1.3449,2.9637,0.8511,0.982,2.5233,0.8579,0.1384,1.5291,4.9753,1.7402,4.7821,5.2338,0.2583,0.9022,6.0994,6.8633,0.54,3.9794,1.5317,7.5253,1.6289,0.0873,6.3596,2.6113,3.0236,1.6132,1.0126,3.1118,4.8833,0.7426,0.9721,3.0193,3.8922,0.5144,0.8609,4.7423,4.1272,2.861,1.1225,0.3893,1.3885,6.3863,4.2582,0.9545,2.3852,1.1399,3.6448,2.3864,1.9671,5.2736,2.2118,3.7211,2.5562,0.049,7.1153,1.5407,1.072,2.5272,1.2776,5.0659,7.2997,2.013,1.9044,5.1184,0.7966,5.7296,4.5236,1.4732,3.9462,7.0378,1.5304,5.4799,1.6251,4.9131,2.4251,0.1555,2.1018,3.5326,0.0132,4.0636,3.2584,2.1661,0.0598,0.0154,0.0001,0.0001,0.3732,5.3581,0.9212,4.3244,3.9753,2.2885,0.8317,4.3227,6.4769,3.9438,0.8419,0.199,11.8096,5.106,5.3362,9.0651,0.266,2.193,0.1745,1.3645,3.3012,3.3394,4.752,1.4865,1.8196,4.6662,12.8356,1.2901,0.7429]}

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump and Kim were committed to reaching a \u201cgood\u201d nuclear deal and hoped talks would be resumed next week. The U.S. will meet with Iran\u2019s leaders on Monday to discuss the \u201cgoodies\u201d of a nuclear deal. U.S. lawmakers have also proposed a deal that would allow Iran to keep enriching uranium in return for cuts in its nuclear program. In the US, the Senate on Friday approved a new version of the Iran nuclear deal with a narrow 76-20 majority, with all Republicans voting in favor of the bill. The House has already approved it. The nuclear deal stipulates that Iran would have to gradually reduce its uranium enrichment capabilities to a certain level. Iran had previously threatened to take steps in response following the removal of two key conditions that led to Trump\u2019s departure from the nuclear deal. The deal prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb through technology it acquires from the deal, which would put the United States at risk of military conflict.

) , according to a new","text":"China has reasonably expanded its islands in the disputed South China Sea and this year construction projects there including radar facilities covered about 290,000 square meters ( 72 acres ), according to a new survey.\nHowever, Japan insisted a government survey for the Japanese islands off its East China Sea coast showed land coverage dropped to roughly the same size as a century ago, according to the Kyodo report.\nThe survey by the government General Land Survey Bureau showed a loss of about 300,000 square meters per year from 1999 to 2006, with no corresponding increase in Japanese islands, Kyodo said, citing the report.\nJapan claims over 4,000 of the Chinese islands in the South China Sea, including the Paracel Islands, an archipelago Japan calls the Diaoyu Islands, but that China also controls.\nChina opposes Japan's claims over its islands called the Senkaku Islands, which China calls the Diaoyu Islands, and which are disputed both by China and Japan.\nJapan's claims to the islands first surfaced in 1946, when the Japanese government took over the islands from the British, and they became an important part of the nation's defense.\nChina has built a number of important military-related facilities in the disputed islands.\nJapan has long argued that the defense and expansionist actions of China in the South China Sea had become destabilizing for the region.\nChina has responded that the Paracels are part of its sovereign territory and it has no intention to alter its status, while at the same time trying to gain stronger and more stable maritime rights in waters it sees as its by far the broadest open access area off the Chinese coasts..\nThe South China Sea, which is about 600 miles long and up to 1,300 miles broad, is one of the world's more heavily populated and most important shipping lanes.\nTensions have intensified in the disputed waters, which are rich in fishery resources and boast a strategic link with deep-water natural gas reserves in the East China Sea.","token_len":406,"entropy":[4.9127,11.6926,7.7403,0.4096,10.5543,1.5061,0.2577,5.1199,0.4802,0.0023,0.0037,2.7678,7.0058,2.1689,8.619,3.7565,4.8733,6.5103,7.8311,4.9894,8.8432,6.3996,7.8153,2.3068,0.0187,0.2408,2.7207,1.7357,15.2212,4.8828,5.3587,2.3179,0.0011,1.6205,3.5465,5.0497,1.3842,0.5038,14.5097,0.2141,4.7418,7.2071,5.4293,5.3531,3.6115,4.8749,1.1733,6.72,2.3013,6.5622,2.6665,3.7001,1.9656,0.0316,1.5378,3.6079,6.1511,6.2677,6.3127,1.4522,5.9216,4.8033,1.1347,3.5241,0.6665,3.6563,6.4932,0.0918,1.6187,2.5321,0.0038,0.936,5.2911,0.0084,4.7081,0.2186,0.2443,2.3158,2.7469,3.5826,0.7984,4.2506,10.0413,5.8781,0.9311,3.0524,3.1909,2.7641,4.0997,0.0778,2.0831,4.5379,0.3442,0.0077,0.1869,0.1041,5.0123,0.116,3.421,5.2102,0.2556,3.4481,0.7893,3.1819,3.8534,5.2111,2.2197,0.4665,8.2278,3.0201,2.1078,5.2456,0.0007,1.2105,2.2923,0.8587,1.7371,2.9997,0.3148,0.263,3.0538,3.8401,4.6124,4.2608,0.4434,1.2247,2.9034,0.7251,7.6775,0.845,1.5832,0.1764,0.8752,0.0035,0.0056,0.9228,2.3616,1.8823,5.3411,0.1579,0.0323,0.4231,0.9538,4.6361,1.5639,0.0,0.0035,8.5525,3.8703,1.2115,0.5875,0.0004,0.0136,1.043,1.4567,3.463,5.1229,4.3036,4.1078,3.7926,5.86,0.533,2.7953,6.3248,2.8574,0.1521,1.2402,2.945,3.2517,2.0191,9.1934,0.8888,1.1947,0.0028,0.0229,1.4088,0.8171,1.0368,2.5813,1.9016,0.6953,0.5872,0.0006,0.0274,0.177,1.1141,1.1932,6.0376,2.6731,3.0392,6.3991,0.7772,2.1197,0.0706,0.7297,0.3522,0.4945,2.982,1.9289,2.5616,2.4181,0.4999,1.2204,7.6815,2.671,0.3638,4.5929,1.5898,0.4381,2.1884,1.2506,1.6978,3.7551,0.9582,1.0576,1.164,1.6158,1.2614,3.2091,2.6136,1.9108,3.1102,3.7891,2.7632,2.3392,1.6036,0.0015,1.0348,4.9747,0.0742,2.841,2.9776,0.6071,3.1272,1.6075,3.9399,2.7434,2.6954,0.0023,7.4407,1.6955,6.0832,2.7688,1.7514,0.9617,0.3338,1.8661,3.2009,2.2782,0.9567,3.7727,1.3547,4.2073,3.7334,0.4116,1.195,8.3936,4.006,6.7178,4.6998,5.6935,0.5741,1.8027,2.9871,0.2315,0.3744,0.0041,0.0025,6.1932,4.4101,6.7914,0.0904,1.7314,1.0559,1.6203,1.1782,0.6661,3.189,1.2506,4.8208,2.7359,1.3381,8.0358,0.0188,1.2319,1.0629,2.309,0.0041,2.2498,4.3881,0.3392,0.7894,4.1856,2.1675,2.3124,2.4928,1.745,5.3897,1.0948,4.0101,3.1699,3.2533,5.4863,0.0262,0.0013,0.0012,4.8665,0.0188,4.2958,6.7017,4.7306,0.435,2.9246,2.9374,2.3475,1.2256,6.1712,2.2122,5.0307,0.0721,2.1941,7.4299,3.1835,2.4103,9.9648,0.0009,7.3086,6.5055,0.7962,7.0204,0.3677,3.8221,4.9582,9.7993,0.7498,2.035,3.8449,0.0051,0.0116,2.9159,1.0017,1.7439,3.9522,4.7159,1.439,1.6668,0.8203,5.4547,0.0603,2.1946,0.1252,2.826,0.3033,5.9317,0.2432,0.6681,2.8172,0.0136,0.3437,1.5544,0.0009,7.0793,4.3339,3.283,1.8468,4.3768,3.0384,3.5346,0.1773,0.6886,1.0463,5.3554,0.5654,1.6922,5.3642,1.3052,1.7791,4.2504,1.0647,2.7091,2.1882,1.6833,6.6196,0.1956,9.2946,0.1404,2.0702,0.8502,9.062,1.7327,5.5299,5.1991,0.6361,7.955,2.4235,0.782,5.0258,2.0675,4.0508,2.3925,0.3378,2.2581,0.1008,0.0153,0.4265]}

The arrest","text":"Mexican authorities on Wednesday arrested a former high-ranking official of President Enrique Pena Nieto s party in a corruption investigation in the northern state of Chihuahua, the state s governor said. The arrest came the same day that Pena Nieto delivered an impassioned plea in congress to his fellow legislators to support his government s anti corruption measures, which are being criticised by opponents and a number of the government s own political allies. The federal government accuses former Mexico s deputy national security adviser Genaro Garcia Luna of running a criminal organization - accused by some prosecutors of also being involved in the murder of a journalist- that was allegedly connected to a Sinaloa cartel.\nMexican officials arrested a former high-level official of President Enrique Pena Nieto\u2019s coalition on Wednesday in a corruption investigation, the governor of the northern state of Chihuahua said.\nNancy Pelosi, Democratic leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, called on the U.S. president Wednesday to cut off economic assistance to Mexico \u2014 and to take action to curb illegal immigration \u2014 before the latest U.S.-Mexico border wall projects are approved, saying such changes would help restore trust between the two countries.\nThe Mexican government is investigating a company that allegedly misused federal funds to build a school in northern Chihuahua state, an official said Monday.\nMexican Interior Secretary Fernando Girelli says that a small group of the Sinaloa drug cartel has infiltrated a border police unit in the northern city of Laredo, near the U.S. border, to help smuggle drugs from Mexico into the United States.\nThe United States on Sunday began destroying some of the wall that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration promised would prevent migrant families from entering the United States. But some officials, including the White House, are warning that the border wall would be rebuilt before long, given that it does not succeed and the United States doesn\u2019t need additional barriers to keep illegal immigrants out.","token_len":407,"entropy":[8.3309,6.5799,4.519,1.9371,2.482,1.6947,3.8383,4.9145,0.5119,0.2287,2.5102,2.0953,4.8128,1.9656,1.5278,0.0003,0.0,11.6043,6.2461,1.8698,2.2156,2.1308,2.3166,3.3278,1.658,3.6697,0.3714,0.0912,2.7254,0.1304,0.0002,0.014,1.3442,2.0859,2.3591,11.1855,5.0018,0.564,0.3136,3.4944,2.5334,1.5645,4.5918,0.4623,0.0253,0.9763,2.9233,0.0047,0.0108,7.2,2.6179,3.1788,0.0822,0.0004,5.4339,3.2318,9.3386,1.2223,3.2349,3.014,4.2888,1.1938,5.0933,1.3897,2.1657,6.841,4.8397,3.1217,3.828,2.1593,1.1109,2.6155,2.4055,6.2636,0.6951,3.9594,2.5782,4.7679,2.6356,0.0115,4.2897,3.218,0.7577,3.7824,3.7326,3.2335,0.4398,2.0307,5.9611,1.3077,6.5609,4.6021,5.7407,2.1771,4.7361,4.9916,1.1145,0.7806,5.1055,7.2333,4.0743,8.3092,0.3333,3.7091,0.4648,3.2891,2.4915,7.2045,5.9966,2.183,2.061,5.7751,0.2495,7.0206,1.7306,1.332,0.0966,1.3232,4.4937,0.0643,1.6663,3.5447,5.7631,7.4749,2.433,2.0459,4.8694,0.1076,1.8968,7.3909,0.0179,0.0011,0.7673,2.8756,2.1502,18.8187,0.0294,2.4091,4.3933,1.8001,0.0468,0.044,0.0021,7.3317,0.4173,0.0498,0.1636,0.0189,0.0012,0.0003,0.0003,12.3876,8.8175,1.1863,10.687,2.9148,0.4549,1.3834,0.3455,0.0378,0.1153,3.7956,1.1656,0.6838,1.2167,1.699,3.7157,0.0352,0.0603,0.0166,0.0001,0.0002,0.0033,0.5616,0.4117,1.6836,4.7713,6.925,6.1096,0.9791,4.5701,1.8805,0.1055,0.0637,5.0486,0.021,0.0007,0.4285,0.2767,0.0926,0.0065,0.3713,2.6139,1.2023,1.3713,2.4754,0.0023,0.0037,0.0556,3.5601,7.2513,0.2886,6.7734,1.3086,7.3879,3.0772,0.1635,0.9647,8.8275,2.1042,1.6066,4.1697,2.0067,1.7268,3.2346,3.4171,1.4715,4.5875,3.9936,1.576,6.2947,4.4839,0.0015,0.0196,1.4834,0.3563,1.3115,2.2657,5.7294,2.7065,2.3472,3.1356,2.1624,5.0374,6.3857,1.1309,4.4204,5.515,2.184,1.5031,0.5544,0.3891,0.4809,0.3043,0.467,2.5275,2.7867,1.1394,2.8557,5.2066,2.1398,6.6794,1.174,2.4266,6.5308,1.0641,3.9755,0.9836,0.5222,2.5289,0.7624,7.3782,0.9401,4.0614,1.0539,0.0009,0.0003,0.0103,5.3246,1.1785,4.8773,2.8435,1.2672,5.3334,0.3932,0.8988,3.6004,0.0519,5.3244,3.1237,7.5949,3.6738,10.015,4.2349,4.0969,3.2167,3.0561,5.9338,1.4975,0.0695,4.5788,4.7829,0.0012,0.0685,5.0234,0.2938,2.8165,5.2,2.4639,4.7643,3.3392,1.7281,1.2412,1.6039,1.7748,5.0992,0.1159,5.0655,0.7162,0.0,1.3093,5.521,0.7675,2.5854,0.0073,0.0016,1.8345,0.0969,1.0052,2.6635,3.357,2.9613,0.0008,0.726,2.4543,0.8031,1.5238,0.3376,0.9642,0.0014,0.4744,0.7486,2.0913,4.6232,0.0229,5.1661,2.5853,4.7036,9.3789,4.5509,0.9821,0.9163,4.7317,3.0028,4.3305,1.424,0.002,11.5748,2.9452,0.0082,0.6519,5.3293,1.9619,4.5182,7.7968,5.6597,0.4461,1.4507,0.4034,1.1411,0.0013,0.8059,3.592,3.8981,3.5516,3.8245,0.4862,1.8227,3.9642,0.001,0.4444,2.7918,3.9134,0.3878,1.2671,4.5567,0.6968,2.2986,2.0174,6.4543,3.3146,4.2253,1.7404,5.2937,1.7525,2.6367,5.1353,0.0822,9.4032,5.2724,2.494,3.3415,0.0109,5.7895,3.6704,1.53,0.3943,3.5956,5.8443,5.7031,0.8026,1.9392,2.5108,0.8263,0.4587,0.4104]}

{"prompt":"A group of anti-Brexit Scottish members of parliament has been given the go-ahead to pursue legal action to establish whether the United Kingdom can unilaterally stop the process of leaving the EU , a Scottish","text":"A group of anti-Brexit Scottish members of parliament has been given the go-ahead to pursue legal action to establish whether the United Kingdom can unilaterally stop the process of leaving the EU, a Scottish court has ruled.\nScottish anti-Brexit lawmakers have been allowed to move ahead with legal challenges over their attempts to stop Britain leaving the EU.\nThe group, formed by the anti-Brexit Scottish National Party (SNP) parliamentary secretary Mike Tindal, said in a statement it would make its legal claims over Brexit from Westminster.\nIt says the court ruling means that a further legal challenge is now at an \"a priori\" point.\nScottish Prime Minister Nicola Sturgeon was quick to celebrate the decision and said it would \"ensure that any attempts by those seeking to block the referendum are dealt with responsibly.\n\"By giving the anti-Brexit MPs their day in court, Westminster and the UK government must admit to breaking the law if they cannot unblock the referendum.\"\nThe case centres on whether the European Council, the EU\u2019s highest policymaking organ, can unilaterally decide not to make recommendations to its member states, setting aside the principle that any proposed treaty or regulation must be negotiated and passed in a binding form at European Council meetings.\nThe court ruled that the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, cannot reject the European Council\u2019s recommendations if they are made in accordance with their terms of reference.\nBut in December, a tribunal in Dundee dismissed a similar legal challenge by the Scottish government, with legal experts suggesting that its ruling means that the UK government can ignore the European Council \u2013 a move that could have profound implications for the whole Brexit process.\nThe Scottish court order comes as the clock ticks down on a deal to leave the bloc, and as the next few weeks are likely to see more political wrangling over Brexit, with the prime minister\u2019s demands for stronger concessions before securing a Brexit deal from Brussels raising the possibility of a snap election in the spring.","token_len":407,"entropy":[7.1549,0.3239,6.465,0.0292,6.2606,8.3245,6.5752,1.7497,1.4796,3.3563,3.1656,3.4194,1.4994,2.9404,0.0346,0.0004,0.4138,6.4792,2.8974,0.1042,3.0042,6.968,3.3724,1.3474,5.4109,0.0142,2.3275,5.1982,4.7363,1.2617,3.5042,1.4703,0.9629,0.0449,0.7107,2.439,2.5247,5.3217,2.4201,0.6042,0.4563,0.0612,0.1222,22.7912,0.0033,5.9243,0.0008,0.6985,5.2459,0.8735,0.6774,4.4298,0.1563,4.0705,1.3364,0.1349,1.4318,3.7303,3.4137,3.3924,6.0595,0.0829,3.5086,3.2256,0.9131,0.0902,0.7828,1.0724,0.2419,10.6692,3.9513,2.5092,5.4372,0.9555,1.8026,4.367,0.0013,1.4221,1.6609,1.5993,0.4411,0.7847,0.0121,0.0006,0.9743,6.5616,3.8636,6.0092,5.6133,10.0673,0.2555,3.1937,2.7083,0.2586,0.4671,2.6093,1.5722,5.7112,2.3251,3.1599,3.7992,4.7333,3.9481,6.6104,4.4767,2.6673,0.2143,2.3456,4.8159,1.386,3.6947,1.5897,2.8207,1.7237,3.4464,4.7084,1.5352,0.3509,2.6984,2.6063,4.951,1.947,1.8715,7.7608,2.4169,0.1667,1.4546,6.5714,0.745,0.2108,2.9481,0.0008,3.9664,0.0042,2.5772,0.0,4.1617,5.333,0.0131,7.1115,0.2722,1.6603,3.1814,1.2018,1.8086,2.2498,2.2507,6.3394,0.016,0.9234,4.4508,4.8157,1.7468,4.0435,3.3753,0.3348,2.7164,0.8368,3.873,2.2704,2.9756,0.0078,4.2795,4.5436,0.3805,0.326,5.5299,4.5293,1.1319,7.7938,0.0027,0.6957,4.1368,4.4487,5.2395,0.0469,0.0794,0.5368,5.9591,3.0162,1.0764,2.3918,1.3359,3.6984,8.5893,3.313,6.4718,0.677,0.2923,5.6612,0.2825,6.9909,7.2257,1.7325,0.5555,1.233,2.7326,0.0634,1.3755,3.6211,3.7463,0.3245,2.7783,1.2432,3.853,3.198,2.859,1.6701,1.2731,15.42,8.3038,4.6645,3.3199,6.5445,3.9261,7.9665,0.0966,1.3228,3.3965,2.9755,3.3067,0.0036,4.8189,10.3976,1.2503,4.2207,1.2274,0.1137,2.6934,6.3859,4.4041,1.5717,5.0903,1.5625,3.1811,5.3772,4.7766,3.172,3.582,1.2238,0.6482,4.9944,2.4533,4.5279,2.612,1.7856,4.1864,7.6,6.5153,5.3547,1.2259,0.988,0.2525,0.1126,1.2676,2.6563,2.7696,0.7418,1.0327,2.752,2.44,2.112,1.0731,4.2034,1.69,0.0293,0.107,0.5143,0.48,1.8768,6.3284,1.657,3.5449,1.3372,8.3489,0.0214,0.0381,2.2656,3.8802,1.7079,1.1141,4.1594,1.3245,3.5627,0.0038,4.3474,2.8589,2.0397,0.1049,0.6242,0.2304,3.4843,3.5799,5.6116,0.7521,2.5171,4.7905,1.3067,7.4495,0.0053,3.6942,1.7674,3.0747,2.2378,0.1595,2.0563,0.9568,1.4054,4.0164,1.5001,3.9848,6.2333,0.9214,2.8036,0.7883,5.35,3.3013,5.3518,0.9423,1.3397,2.0048,3.1631,2.0108,5.4695,1.0769,2.2509,1.0907,8.5188,2.176,2.6528,0.5983,1.4962,2.9214,4.7096,0.8062,0.1119,1.1602,4.9476,6.2971,1.0365,0.1432,0.1071,1.3949,1.5953,2.781,4.633,2.3327,1.6499,1.1343,8.2638,0.6901,0.2783,1.2118,1.6015,5.0101,1.3994,2.5945,0.0221,3.0576,1.6329,3.4722,2.3246,1.1277,5.6949,3.1385,1.4597,2.9697,3.824,0.0043,1.7036,2.8933,4.0943,2.6242,0.0137,1.1764,3.7129,2.7528,2.267,1.7654,4.8313,0.0097,11.6908,0.251,0.286,7.4281,1.5372,6.6991,6.0148,5.276,6.432,0.6161,3.6866,0.1004,5.7179,1.8229,7.0057,1.3532,2.4825,0.3307,0.8538,4.0694,1.2722,1.9575,1.5799,4.8535,0.2576]}

Hogan Jr., did not charge the 51-year-old with any crime.\nCunningham, a native of Tennessee who has lived in Virginia for decades, has been charged by authorities in Virginia state court with two misdemeanor counts: disorderly conduct in a federal building and damaging federal property. Virginia's Attorney General Mark Herring has alleged Cunningham had \"acted in a violent manner as she repeatedly laughed and berated the senator.\"\nMiller's comments are untrue, and he is trying to use a non-lawyer to help him down the street,\" Hogan said in a statement released Friday in Virginia.\nA lawyer for Cunningham will not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Hogan declined for now to comment on Cunningham.\nLast year, Cunningham was convicted of assaulting a police officer in Virginia, which led to her spending time in prison.\nIn addition, she was stripped of her U.S. civil rights and banned from the U.S. for violating a federal criminal code that describes violence and property damage related to campaign financing violations.\nCunningham was a Virginia Republican who became active in the 1970s after realizing that conservative causes were ignored in her state. She became a national figure and the subject of satirical comic strips as the \"Mother of the American Left\" who was critical of the federal government and other conservative causes in the wake of the Watergate scandal.\nCunningham, who has remained in political and legislative custody, became a political celebrity in 2014 when a photograph of her with a handgun showed up on a web page for the National Rifle Association.","token_len":407,"entropy":[10.1433,4.4666,2.6758,11.1898,1.07,8.0877,5.0474,0.0303,0.1818,0.0211,3.9493,4.3617,0.2289,3.3626,1.4867,0.4827,0.1259,4.2989,2.1595,2.9619,0.0002,0.0018,0.001,0.4239,1.571,6.3768,4.6563,0.2505,0.6324,4.2034,3.9262,1.844,0.4028,7.9707,1.7934,10.1038,0.9206,0.4469,3.2242,6.3967,4.8633,1.0206,0.5608,0.2545,24.5975,1.4765,6.6301,0.4044,1.1305,1.9795,6.1931,1.1238,2.6968,2.8794,5.1273,1.1718,2.1867,1.6787,0.6179,1.2051,0.9405,1.4073,0.3413,1.582,2.0688,0.0034,1.6613,1.1832,6.2359,0.7926,0.4835,1.9726,0.0066,1.8531,3.5495,0.0656,4.9223,1.4534,1.4619,4.1025,0.0008,0.0016,0.0022,1.2398,3.2582,2.7654,0.9459,7.4682,3.5542,0.0594,6.4735,2.5758,0.1402,4.8576,0.0919,5.8767,2.8283,7.2708,0.0122,0.0038,0.0113,0.0008,3.2215,1.4896,0.8009,0.4676,0.3351,8.354,0.0045,0.0008,1.0791,1.7801,4.7191,0.1103,5.4127,1.962,2.2818,2.426,0.1554,4.0638,0.7464,3.672,0.1829,3.0089,1.1246,2.7602,3.9536,5.2145,1.7699,2.7185,6.8478,0.6637,0.607,3.2967,2.2456,0.4802,5.2956,4.1242,0.0597,3.7033,1.1589,6.1227,0.4454,0.6014,5.238,0.8295,0.0455,0.3452,7.8977,2.2085,2.4775,0.0022,1.7113,0.1704,0.0022,1.4073,6.5992,1.1999,3.7555,2.9696,5.177,0.9911,1.2413,4.5091,0.9537,4.4213,3.22,5.9266,8.2645,1.41,5.1793,0.002,2.0729,2.7162,2.4978,0.245,12.1244,2.4053,4.7061,3.4065,9.4818,0.9282,3.03,3.4298,2.0129,6.3818,0.0424,4.6279,3.4113,5.1084,0.1978,5.5645,0.877,1.9797,2.8507,1.3269,7.2003,1.7488,5.5499,7.5017,4.5474,0.7482,0.6788,0.2318,0.0847,4.2373,1.5958,5.6334,2.6829,0.2323,0.7737,4.3722,3.8646,0.1086,1.5481,4.1303,0.6278,4.6517,0.1029,1.5048,0.0426,0.0251,0.6804,3.7015,3.4616,0.0481,1.5086,1.4762,6.7245,6.7555,0.0305,0.2079,1.2703,1.8018,2.1813,0.3054,5.3871,1.6156,0.153,2.4314,1.5257,2.898,0.3941,4.2025,0.6848,3.3107,0.0513,1.4766,2.4997,2.0261,3.368,2.5631,0.279,2.5614,7.524,3.3877,0.2511,1.3739,0.7625,1.46,2.6754,4.5528,2.2012,2.4219,1.0488,6.8306,0.0773,0.1971,3.2642,0.0007,0.0026,0.0012,7.9297,0.1177,2.215,5.4914,0.0141,2.9695,1.9202,0.0002,0.0132,0.0382,1.5407,5.6525,2.1531,1.4821,4.8619,1.021,1.3869,6.415,4.6304,2.4718,6.6845,0.7212,7.419,0.0069,6.5681,4.0225,5.1833,0.2168,0.5925,1.6426,0.003,0.0001,1.9727,3.4249,5.2739,3.6319,1.5164,3.9392,5.6209,0.2788,0.8375,6.0013,0.035,2.7798,6.4618,1.1015,5.6369,4.4341,1.4325,7.2049,1.809,3.5875,1.6596,0.6155,1.0904,2.9211,0.7799,3.0765,1.9611,2.9155,5.0142,3.6198,0.0018,7.0488,6.3838,1.8739,4.1939,3.3756,3.5332,5.4561,0.5163,1.6043,5.6959,4.2577,1.3099,5.3603,2.6933,4.9522,0.0211,1.2013,4.2295,0.108,1.479,4.801,2.1576,1.0169,3.1677,1.1101,3.8886,0.0019,0.692,0.9471,0.1439,0.2649,0.4021,1.7951,0.0013,0.0002,2.6351,0.4851,2.2049,6.176,2.1202,4.8667,3.1604,5.3575,6.9591,1.8477,4.6229,0.7822,2.8931,4.1325,1.4141,3.4863,0.8902,4.0722,4.7498,0.3756,0.1512,2.2054,2.1501,5.5872,4.1593,2.9225,0.4725,1.6839,5.1797,1.8127,2.3093,1.2308,2.7572,0.6528,0.0012,0.6993]}

He is trying to rebuild his government.\nMr Hariri\u2019s Cabinet resigned on Jan. 22 over demands for changes in governance and the judiciary, prompting protests. The next two cabinet meetings have been held but were not productive in terms of a new agreement over the composition of the new Cabinet.\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf Arab countries have been urging both sides to return to the negotiating table.\n\u201cI hope the dialogue and talks will start on the political level,\u201d Mr al-Shuhada said, adding, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with the dialogue? Do I have anything in my hands?\u201d\nPresident Michel Aoun had said he was confident Mr Saad al-Hariri could form a new cabinet that could govern beyond Jan. 26. Mr Aoun and Mr Ali Zeidan, the son of Lebanon\u2019s former president \u00c9mile Lahoud that is the second most popular politician in Lebanon, agreed to call on the next president to appoint a prime minister and the new Cabinet.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Aoun, whose term ends in 2020, will have to decide on a new president. Mr Aoun has not mentioned any names, only that the president will be determined after the meeting with the political establishment is concluded.\nIt has remained unclear through the week what form a dialogue would take, and one group of observers, the National Security Network, released only a statement on Sunday saying the new president should \u201cnot be a member of the current Cabinet.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a president who wants to form a new government to solve the crisis in Lebanon.

The pontiff said that there was a danger in countries that possess nuclear weapons that could cause disasters worldwide in an instant.\n\u201cAs the Vatican\u2019s Secretary of State described last week about the new security threats caused by the use of nuclear weapons in the case of an accidental or deliberate use of a nuclear weapon, a terrorist act resulting in a nuclear explosion could be the source of a catastrophe that would cause widespread, total environmental and human devastation, \u201d Francis told the assembly.\nThe Pope also recalled that nuclear weapons had been responsible for the deaths of countless innocents. This includes civilians who were killed when a nuclear device was deployed accidentally. He also noted that this number has continued to grow and continues to increase with each passing year.\n\u201cIn view of the growing potential for nuclear war to kill so many innocent human beings, the international community must address the urgent need to prohibit the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and to reduce their stockpiles, \u201d said Francis in a homily at mass at St. Peter\u2019s Square. He also urged the international community to be more focused on efforts to ensure the total elimination of the nuclear threat.\nFrancis emphasized that the danger of nuclear weapons arises from the fact that their use has the ability to cause extensive and irreversible damage to the planet and the environment we all share. He referred to the fact that nuclear weapons and the destruction caused by them have been a source of widespread suffering from all over the world, despite decades for many of us to struggle with this issue.\n\u201cWe must never forget that human life is also sacred and that only human beings bear responsibility for creating and maintaining peace in the world, \u201d the church leader said in an announcement that was published by Vatican Radio.\nThe Pope then added that the world must take responsibility for protecting and safeguarding the environment where human life began.","token_len":408,"entropy":[8.7383,4.2185,1.9692,2.574,1.004,4.6698,0.0424,0.1497,3.9834,4.3911,7.8658,0.0084,8.101,0.471,0.001,3.8818,3.4975,2.9343,0.7075,1.6486,4.6626,2.0484,1.0193,10.5181,5.4709,5.9781,2.7572,0.0002,3.2012,0.3344,3.8971,2.4103,0.0015,1.5009,1.4911,4.3877,1.7298,1.4526,3.6845,3.0808,5.6488,1.6557,6.6788,0.3168,0.225,1.8371,2.5614,2.9234,6.3432,6.5062,4.8794,3.8452,4.2877,0.5065,0.4136,18.1322,8.0206,8.0176,2.0289,4.5657,12.9591,7.7027,1.9213,4.3859,0.654,0.0739,8.007,4.5552,0.5249,6.0468,0.925,5.2848,5.324,5.2364,6.1126,0.0221,1.8964,4.4929,0.0064,0.2406,0.102,2.7513,1.1079,7.0223,0.0035,3.647,5.5079,2.7113,3.0084,3.1125,0.5741,2.5325,0.7121,0.3109,0.2724,4.4032,6.8052,3.4044,7.9632,0.4352,2.5194,1.2206,2.4505,2.3768,1.8606,3.0459,4.1926,0.0407,2.3006,2.6892,3.1029,1.7212,3.17,4.0042,4.1008,7.0639,7.6347,2.7572,2.5267,3.677,2.1159,9.7593,7.158,5.4666,2.3389,1.3574,4.9747,1.5975,0.5092,2.813,2.2705,1.7619,6.6822,1.1901,3.7984,0.6491,3.5613,1.0129,7.0731,0.0247,1.1377,1.7145,0.1012,4.8266,4.2506,0.0006,2.5846,5.2711,3.4596,5.1605,1.4354,0.9384,1.9409,2.7726,1.8168,1.3398,2.0382,1.243,3.4587,7.2722,1.588,2.9324,1.6717,2.8421,0.1821,4.4254,5.6241,3.0422,4.1857,0.1487,1.4418,2.5884,4.5925,0.04,1.5856,3.6517,1.9054,1.1095,0.9397,0.3946,0.3898,1.3621,0.5717,2.7963,4.9818,0.0046,0.6524,2.4176,5.8273,0.8816,1.6892,2.7488,4.2985,4.6776,5.8756,0.0205,0.9766,4.3383,0.1711,0.5802,0.921,5.1368,0.0138,0.7819,5.2355,0.6299,4.1052,0.3318,0.9212,6.2342,1.1845,3.0241,0.142,0.256,0.118,1.7124,1.8992,1.0335,5.0887,2.1605,3.2884,0.0174,1.9101,5.0362,0.6675,3.9844,1.1351,3.4843,1.3519,6.2579,0.0107,2.7224,8.8055,2.2648,2.096,0.118,0.3597,12.5028,0.271,1.5619,5.1072,0.8527,3.1707,1.6798,2.4244,1.2642,1.1409,0.0056,0.1172,4.5514,2.2409,4.1733,0.1147,4.6048,0.1474,3.9592,1.9604,8.4342,2.3843,0.0422,2.6449,1.197,2.0916,1.7316,0.2387,5.8382,0.0005,4.1203,0.5063,1.2044,5.6078,1.4059,0.703,0.9262,5.7389,0.9575,1.5195,2.5405,0.012,3.2333,0.5585,2.8334,3.3839,4.37,0.0167,1.2617,5.9332,2.4721,1.5674,0.6688,0.5995,1.3714,3.8924,1.6301,1.8975,1.7229,9.781,1.1074,3.1515,0.3576,1.4672,5.6485,0.0724,0.743,2.7334,0.0196,2.0666,0.286,5.3669,2.2452,4.5518,3.0597,0.0486,0.5364,1.5973,1.6811,3.6443,1.9838,0.0133,4.6533,2.4885,4.8704,3.7823,1.3253,0.0357,0.1499,1.4662,6.9615,5.8204,9.0272,4.0877,1.6661,2.671,0.2625,5.836,1.5398,2.9581,2.526,0.2527,0.3854,1.3162,0.1451,3.8546,0.6927,4.8998,1.0933,0.6423,3.7973,1.9231,0.8082,4.0652,4.669,1.229,1.23,5.7999,4.2165,0.9497,6.3889,1.3608,0.132,6.4079,1.7593,1.8832,3.7132,3.042,0.4788,0.1597,2.1397,1.8293,0.4218,2.8623,7.7875,5.2871,0.5831,3.4498,2.9002,5.9559,3.5893,1.8381,3.6763,1.6199,2.7714,0.8146,0.9611,0.5484,2.239,1.5,4.5601,3.5948,0.4561,1.3539,1.8637,1.2827,3.5477,2.9034,0.1984,3.2216,3.1152,1.8989,0.0001,1.1314,2.6239,7.509,2.6319,0.8268,6.53,1.2173]}

Steve Scalise, a Republican from his home state of Louisiana, in an interview with the Guardian. \"I mean, I got called a fraud and a cheat in Louisiana, so I don't trust the left in America.\" Scalise is among a growing list of GOP lawmakers and presidential candidates, who have criticized Biden on his record as vice president under President Barack Obama.\nAs President Biden campaigned for Democrats control of the Senate and then the White House, he said the pandemic was his top priority.\nBut Biden has now spent months as president and at least one week as COVID-19 cases have surpassed 2 million, and the country is still grappling with vaccine production and distribution, and the number of Americans infected with a version of the virus first identified in Brazil. As President, Biden has tried to strike a balance between the health of all Americans and the economic needs of the country\u2019s struggling businesses.\nBiden won a second term on the promise to help struggling families, particularly those who didn\u2019t vote for him in November. His first 100 days also include sweeping changes made to undo Trump administration policies, including a suspension of DACA protections for Dreamers and a crackdown on transgender children in the military.\nAnd yet, even with everything Trump and the Republicans have done to undermine the president and the Democratic party, Biden\u2019s poll numbers are at best near or equal to what they were on January 1.\n\u201cHe\u2019s running the show,\u201d said Chris Nail, professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame. \u201cBut, for the first time since his election, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s in a positive light.\u201d","token_len":408,"entropy":[10.4621,2.9252,6.9972,0.8456,10.4875,0.6707,3.3369,10.1127,8.1114,11.2946,0.0565,0.0389,3.4134,0.6702,1.9267,9.1634,4.4969,1.315,2.6371,0.5576,3.9627,0.7767,2.8886,7.678,7.0265,5.0833,5.1132,0.0511,3.9661,6.1204,1.1959,8.0763,6.5573,7.972,0.2296,0.4501,0.3437,0.446,11.1972,2.381,2.4788,1.9076,0.0838,3.7765,1.9089,2.8873,1.5371,1.4859,5.8762,4.4459,3.3277,5.6106,3.9554,4.1444,0.518,0.6123,1.3996,0.8593,0.9235,3.9682,0.0013,4.027,6.1834,0.0001,0.5613,2.3399,0.9408,0.4118,7.3415,0.4682,0.2178,0.478,0.8646,1.5533,2.3062,1.1726,0.1016,1.0678,1.8355,4.7615,0.4114,0.7433,2.2807,4.1382,0.1593,2.3227,5.6176,6.3247,1.8356,5.7192,2.7604,1.6757,6.8462,2.8556,5.1051,1.5724,3.1482,1.0301,2.8093,0.0007,5.6906,1.848,8.3803,4.0681,4.4883,1.176,4.0641,0.0004,2.6858,3.782,1.6054,1.3748,2.5646,0.0041,3.3848,0.4953,3.8639,5.6657,0.5953,4.2591,3.2433,1.0178,3.7309,10.7743,5.3327,2.0359,1.8322,3.0562,3.5174,0.1315,6.2393,0.4349,1.2415,0.0014,0.4867,0.28,15.325,5.4437,4.8495,5.6856,1.1483,4.7362,11.857,0.0377,0.3202,0.3702,2.3156,5.692,2.5494,0.9682,0.0004,0.6722,1.0538,3.1745,2.8846,12.8186,3.0075,4.5556,4.7956,3.4897,0.2701,0.626,1.0135,3.664,3.5592,2.0219,5.6085,4.9372,3.2604,5.9745,3.6091,4.2632,5.4693,1.6226,2.1442,2.7448,0.5839,13.0827,12.637,5.1318,8.4955,12.6103,2.6486,10.282,5.8451,2.5445,2.7658,2.6561,2.1443,6.2462,0.9816,2.4259,3.0352,0.0204,9.2276,8.3493,1.9427,4.5181,2.4684,3.1122,1.9356,4.0045,0.0278,3.6289,3.2834,0.2578,3.1809,9.1007,0.1676,0.4771,2.3542,8.2728,3.3524,0.3804,5.8766,1.9442,5.4375,5.6194,3.7412,0.7713,1.5125,5.1368,0.1379,5.9973,0.1623,0.5895,0.1993,2.4251,3.6099,2.1968,4.4846,0.3026,0.5971,1.0214,4.5521,4.7238,0.0679,1.2116,2.4954,14.7145,6.9217,6.6496,4.8052,4.9386,0.7793,0.6347,3.1988,0.0005,6.1631,2.5028,3.226,0.1267,3.5922,1.8986,3.8659,1.0825,4.3764,5.3028,1.6411,2.1118,5.2262,1.417,2.1242,5.5061,13.2582,1.9228,1.283,4.9312,0.7608,0.5902,1.7371,4.2699,0.769,3.494,3.4712,4.2908,0.0347,5.6056,4.0338,7.1333,2.5824,7.4429,0.4336,10.0842,8.722,5.7712,1.7104,1.3436,0.7138,1.7866,6.9434,0.0907,4.9326,5.2328,0.6893,2.986,0.0068,1.138,1.597,4.1383,0.0102,7.1952,4.8563,2.9909,0.9076,0.9273,0.3681,0.6669,4.2797,4.3164,0.8977,3.2368,2.8752,7.5761,5.2149,3.0892,2.2161,2.5673,0.566,0.8297,1.021,5.4821,1.2664,3.0957,2.4556,1.8271,3.0825,2.0617,0.3144,2.6619,4.6031,0.1339,0.1222,7.9406,0.2431,1.3002,4.1398,5.5737,5.5899,4.554,5.2082,0.0836,2.2975,1.3872,0.4313,3.7667,3.451,2.2443,1.1377,0.9125,6.2956,5.123,7.3552,2.0678,0.8807,0.1008,4.4965,3.3657,3.6604,1.8733,6.4049,6.1699,3.9106,4.3172,6.3429,8.757,0.5424,5.4116,0.4076,0.7877,0.021,0.0973,1.3313,0.3103,0.002,4.116,0.0001,0.9212,5.2056,0.2956,2.1817,2.799,3.8155,2.2222,1.4891,0.0342,1.7809,2.9738,2.6993,0.5186,7.0679,3.7715,2.3268,1.7133,0.0282,2.1234,4.7068,1.9609,0.0563,0.5003,5.3736,2.6735,3.7577,1.4054,0.4351,3.5811,3.5999]}

Senator John Thune , a Republican","text":"Two U.S. senators said late on Wednesday that they had reached a bipartisan deal on legislation aimed at easing hurdles to getting self-driving cars to drivers. U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, and Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, said in a statement that the legislation would address privacy and liability protections for vehicles that use artificial intelligence to handle driving. \u201cWe have taken important steps to encourage innovation in our transportation system, including through the [Department of Transportation] Roadmap for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems,\u201d the senators said. \u201cThis legislation will help facilitate these efforts by streamlining regulations, improving public awareness and facilitating consumer education, while also ensuring a level playing field for consumers and car makers alike.\u201d The senators said that legislation will also reduce red tape for self-driving testing, and allow testing to begin sooner. It would also give insurance companies and consumers advance written notice of self-driving vehicle deployments and safety alerts. The senators do not plan to bring the legislation to a vote. In November, senators from both parties unveiled their own version of a bill. In the U.S. Senate, the measure would require that vehicles use sensors and cameras to allow drivers to stay in control of the car in the event of a safety alert. A House Transportation Committee subcommittee backed the bill last month. Sen. Mike Rounds, who led the drafting of the current legislation, also said Wednesday that it would have a \u201cstrong focus\u201d on driver safety. Rounds was a longtime executive with Uber and has raised concerns about the safety of self-driving machines. Sen. Thune said that he was pleased with the legislation, which he said would help to \u201cfacilitate a safer road network\u201d in which drivers can trust and feel safe. \u201cWith artificial intelligence coming and going at warp speed, it\u2019s important to give consumers time to familiarize themselves with what these new technologies will be like,\u201d he said in a statement.","token_len":409,"entropy":[7.1725,0.0797,0.0303,0.0499,2.5921,3.4012,6.1928,2.7641,1.6755,0.7041,0.931,2.5342,3.7247,0.9569,4.91,2.3064,0.951,4.1741,2.5135,0.0057,3.7475,8.1956,0.8796,5.5393,9.1461,0.0017,0.2444,0.2701,2.6668,6.1819,1.4878,7.05,0.0021,0.0053,0.0043,2.4606,2.6504,2.7201,0.0001,0.9137,1.3004,1.7194,0.3482,0.0096,0.0923,0.1219,2.5184,1.5884,5.1841,0.0731,0.0,0.2892,0.2454,0.0416,0.0756,0.0018,0.0,0.0189,1.3746,2.3623,0.182,1.0278,0.5393,1.263,2.6784,0.9549,4.0534,4.2935,1.9953,4.593,4.7906,1.2419,4.1547,1.8815,3.4708,3.9035,0.0067,1.1777,6.5055,3.9167,0.8389,14.8003,7.1827,8.5552,2.3517,4.9525,4.6932,0.0935,0.2834,6.0097,4.2121,1.3047,2.8118,1.7004,1.227,1.0441,1.3995,3.8505,1.2996,8.383,4.1064,0.0035,0.2257,1.2875,4.7679,2.954,1.4411,5.5927,4.5929,1.0544,3.233,1.6241,9.4346,7.0921,3.6218,10.0169,0.1426,0.3006,3.4509,0.3277,3.4192,1.5277,1.4696,2.2524,5.8058,4.9164,1.9868,1.9965,6.7371,0.0012,3.8957,1.384,2.2307,4.6065,2.3809,1.3963,5.4228,6.1355,5.9515,2.1271,3.094,1.5897,2.4061,3.9786,1.7333,0.0145,0.0025,0.5225,2.8754,1.4016,6.1034,2.131,3.3479,1.192,1.4626,1.8893,2.2963,1.5003,0.87,1.5577,5.5756,2.6123,1.6567,4.2728,5.0273,0.0169,1.5106,4.2924,0.0033,0.0155,7.6017,1.5584,2.4627,3.8513,4.6305,1.6097,2.6617,4.3058,0.8923,4.841,2.1936,0.7611,4.3094,6.4286,0.1492,3.0766,3.6753,8.4983,6.4149,0.5728,1.1307,4.9467,0.0019,0.1146,2.9933,5.6709,2.3415,4.4372,4.4233,0.8708,1.5407,1.2088,8.1911,0.015,3.1628,0.1606,3.9969,1.3986,0.7319,0.4387,1.3059,0.1226,1.8744,3.9068,4.7792,0.1574,5.1246,2.8458,1.5814,0.1978,4.3003,2.8897,1.4035,2.0954,0.0244,2.1966,1.5056,3.7459,3.3179,1.9224,4.9133,0.0004,0.0101,1.332,0.2742,0.129,1.7916,3.8453,1.6094,2.3722,3.1697,4.2056,3.2968,4.1271,2.6142,3.2379,0.8061,4.9216,2.6532,0.0734,5.5893,1.0555,3.1519,0.4814,2.049,1.807,3.6233,2.1316,0.4717,0.3357,0.836,4.5468,3.5526,0.4437,4.0772,4.3696,5.9304,0.8602,3.4498,6.5696,0.5164,1.4829,3.105,1.0479,0.7315,4.5682,0.0456,3.682,3.2306,0.1854,3.5912,3.1958,0.2478,8.0004,0.1506,0.0883,5.4463,2.5122,0.1453,4.3994,1.9958,3.2719,0.2331,3.0076,0.9446,4.0227,1.7275,16.2094,2.1278,5.3544,4.4877,2.6023,1.2924,0.255,4.1053,0.6931,0.9146,5.2327,4.2201,2.6408,5.1532,6.4828,2.7363,4.5715,1.7516,3.117,5.3596,0.4752,0.3179,0.9838,1.8772,0.2039,1.5157,0.0031,0.0018,8.2347,0.8927,4.498,0.0072,5.9858,0.0242,1.3217,1.9115,2.0573,2.308,3.2475,0.7812,0.2032,3.3842,1.3849,2.012,1.396,0.7211,1.2224,2.5043,3.3632,10.3254,0.1093,6.2475,0.0031,0.0021,2.1766,3.7258,4.4179,5.3768,2.9301,0.2269,4.824,2.528,2.3106,2.2286,4.7655,3.5748,5.4462,0.3288,0.7992,3.8134,0.1315,4.7113,10.3132,0.0252,4.6543,4.3218,1.3802,4.5345,7.687,0.0934,0.2914,1.804,5.4768,9.1698,1.5076,1.9698,1.3754,5.1803,2.3874,5.813,0.1311,7.2023,0.0025,0.0224,0.1736,2.9833,3.7265,3.3669,0.63,2.9723,2.7373,2.2501,1.8505,0.7986,0.9409,1.089,0.1452,2.7315,0.6258,0.0791,0.1107]}

They will also work with the sheriff or a designated law enforcement representative to provide immigration enforcement officers with all relevant information necessary to execute the deportation, such as case histories and records of prior arrests. Each year, more than 50 percent of all deportations are either expedited or conducted in Texas.\n\u201dCounty jail administrators will have access to federal resources to identify and document immigrants who are eligible for status or who may be undocumented,\u201d Wolf said.\nThe agreements are intended to enhance efforts to help federal authorities determine the status of foreign nationals who are arrested and booked in local detention centers. Wolf said the agreements would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of such efforts, allowing county jail officers to share information more quickly about the eligibility of detainees for removal or temporary protection.","token_len":410,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,7.5259,3.2987,8.2942,8.5678,3.235,2.2048,1.5038,6.3229,2.9395,6.0717,17.2261,7.9865,10.3837,3.3933,1.6096,3.1713,4.7902,1.2022,0.979,1.3918,9.1668,2.0128,6.344,3.8018,6.8363,0.0079,9.8993,0.1653,6.5004,0.2033,7.0015,0.1794,1.5038,2.3945,2.0681,2.3567,0.7417,0.5699,4.9483,7.6327,6.0386,5.9786,3.2989,2.4357,7.3702,3.6639,0.5856,0.0336,1.5209,5.2458,0.8199,0.872,1.7427,2.7745,6.5078,3.8308,5.5424,1.088,0.8429,6.5738,0.5593,2.333,4.0676,2.4215,0.7914,0.5703,1.9641,2.0298,2.8019,2.0395,1.31,2.0888,2.3844,6.2968,2.6839,1.0328,0.4317,0.7678,5.3239,0.0039,2.4469,3.2446,3.5339,7.8159,0.2306,0.376,0.3205,0.0006,1.7913,3.906,2.8623,3.3149,2.3606,5.0115,4.5367,7.9693,0.013,0.0007,0.0016,1.992,0.0486,0.029,0.0005,4.9615,8.7703,8.5698,5.412,3.77,0.0076,1.4085,0.0071,3.2212,1.4802,2.4741,1.5549,2.8214,4.1706,2.0958,4.0807,2.5881,1.7251,21.6498,1.4798,1.2945,1.6679,4.282,5.5096,0.1227,4.2099,3.4192,1.3691,1.4932,1.7554,4.5505,4.5398,4.0526,3.1272,2.9934,0.5793,1.7235,0.6518,0.9103,0.001,0.2973,0.5697,3.7984,0.8287,6.8916,4.0689,0.7096,4.0353,4.7028,3.8834,0.3478,0.5553,3.7878,2.7742,0.5262,3.8442,0.3228,2.6371,2.6841,3.1793,1.5872,2.8222,1.2894,4.7962,3.2351,10.5833,0.4836,4.903,5.3012,1.0158,2.0945,1.6698,3.5064,3.0519,5.3109,2.3979,2.3028,0.4432,1.0451,0.1878,0.2005,3.3766,5.219,6.1947,2.2103,0.6207,4.3073,3.1227,2.3355,0.1418,2.1758,2.17,5.5513,2.7831,6.8357,3.1829,5.8201,4.9275,3.321,3.3671,1.9685,2.1707,0.3222,3.6937,3.5064,1.2478,1.4954,1.4534,2.6717,0.7315,0.4116,5.5988,0.2787,5.8292,0.0928,6.1964,2.1257,1.1867,6.3724,1.8416,4.7413,2.9185,6.6531,0.0824,3.7792,2.9034,3.6023,2.3793,1.0185,2.2821,0.0005,0.0009,0.214,3.2378,6.6869,0.8257,3.8242,2.4623,2.2445,1.3726,1.9597,2.7426,5.6164,5.0251,2.8618,1.9425,0.7566,6.8678,0.9025,4.5833,0.2923,0.5182,3.0433,0.5249,2.0818,2.1717,3.6815,4.0926,3.5352,3.7745,0.0076,4.5341,0.3366,2.7585,4.0359,1.4126,1.307,0.1732,5.7387,3.3771,1.1278,3.2125,0.1463,5.0681,1.5193,5.7322,4.3413,5.3911,0.0056,7.0796,2.4205,1.511,4.3965,1.0995,4.6717,1.063,1.0796,6.0178,5.8374,0.1772,3.5808,0.0357,3.3886,2.3071,0.0208,1.8616,3.1432,0.1891,1.1087,6.7203,8.65,0.0071,0.2064,7.2345,1.7617,4.5297,0.9247,0.5264,2.0147,0.1025,4.504,0.1415,1.4766,6.2278,1.1183,2.742,2.3941,0.0199,3.6512,3.9226,1.249,4.7159,1.0639,6.423,3.9091,1.0832,0.9742,3.7969,0.3751,5.1677,3.766,1.3998,2.3492,0.7308,8.2973,2.0685,2.2911,0.2894,0.3424,0.1042,0.0966,0.6408,2.0584,1.24,2.127,4.2219,0.0583,3.8079,5.0679,0.5985,4.6061,5.5956,1.8764,4.0265,2.3324,2.6554,0.2679,5.9613,1.1217,1.1537,0.9673,4.773,1.9286,6.5567,1.0839,4.0331,5.2744,0.9854,1.0154,4.6423,0.3709,1.131,0.6303,3.2536,4.0318,1.2707,3.1949,1.6152,1.2767,0.0113,5.641,1.5908,1.9669,4.549,1.9105,0.7429,3.4992,0.2105,5.0526,0.4591,3.495,2.4515,3.2806,2.0112,6.833,0.4115,3.5722,4.0601,2.1371,2.6672,6.8753,3.3949,1.0301]}

After years of applying (and sometimes being rejected), I was finally accepted at Toronto\u2019s prestigious Wilfrid Laurier University. I was already looking forward to my freshman year and was very excited to learn new things, live a new life, and meet new people. However, with all of the excitement came the dread and panic of starting college.\nOne of the things that a school will tell you after the first couple of weeks of orientation is to come up with a budget. I don\u2019t know about you, but getting an overall budget seemed easy enough. I figured it was all about cutting personal expenses and spending my money on extra-curricular activities and classes. After all, I already had a job.\nThe budget I created, however, did not take into account the realities of living in Canada. I have to admit that I went ahead and set a few extra budgets (like meal money) but it was a couple of dollars here and there that went unspent. Looking back, I am truly glad that I did not put too much into cash and my spending wasn\u2019t as frivolous as I thought it would be. The reality is that when you live away from home, you will probably need to cut back on your living expenses to balance the cost of living.\nHowever, when you are studying hard to get a degree, you simply cannot afford to have the same money that you would in a regular workday. There are also some other costs that are not easily cut down, and I will be exploring those costs throughout the rest of this article.

The area is filled with beautiful rocky beaches, including a beach with a boardwalk that leads to nearby historic town of Provincetown. This makes this area the perfect location for a relaxing vacation with family or friends.\nAs a national park, the whole area is protected and free to visit (which might be a good thing since there\u2019s a lot to see). In fact, there\u2019s a park ranger station right on the beach at the southeast corner of the island, which is just steps away from the main pier. Unfortunately, they\u2019re closed on Mondays, but the park itself can be visited any day. The harbor itself is where the boats and ferries depart from Provincetown, so if you\u2019re heading towards there you may as well take a short walk from the main pier. I think it\u2019s worth taking a few minutes to soak up the surrounding greenery while cruising.","token_len":411,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,7.2739,4.122,3.6024,0.692,5.3439,2.1182,5.0382,1.929,0.9273,0.8934,5.2685,3.6122,3.9125,3.9713,13.7813,8.6721,9.0433,8.983,0.0927,1.2153,4.7706,0.8087,1.0284,4.9697,0.6456,1.3485,0.4496,0.5593,7.2198,0.0654,2.1272,2.2823,1.5002,4.3237,2.8014,0.6108,0.3128,2.5306,1.4569,9.572,1.149,10.2746,3.6683,0.4941,2.9158,6.1005,1.6453,7.075,3.082,3.3537,5.0613,1.0651,9.118,1.8149,6.3262,8.0685,4.5364,4.3543,10.6224,1.6003,2.6733,0.6782,2.9276,3.1254,0.4792,0.0324,6.8036,0.4394,3.1692,5.0513,7.0037,0.0158,2.1234,5.5214,3.5069,5.0659,2.9343,3.5163,4.8245,1.0051,2.4548,7.3374,0.0334,6.6715,3.642,2.3821,5.6493,0.1742,1.4471,5.6179,0.1794,6.1395,3.4671,1.227,7.5452,5.5913,3.3138,0.2818,5.8459,5.4065,1.8577,5.9464,3.3311,5.2367,0.0047,2.4565,1.2448,4.5435,0.2316,3.1233,0.678,0.0911,0.0038,0.1765,3.9371,2.0114,3.9823,2.4357,1.9589,6.5543,1.223,0.0187,0.0828,4.362,6.4149,2.799,1.6335,2.7903,3.6289,4.0533,0.0016,0.0053,0.0034,2.7909,5.011,3.8781,2.0059,0.2316,4.4073,5.7819,5.7426,6.1683,0.0407,5.1419,4.2368,0.5157,5.9431,5.7993,0.0213,2.2945,0.6162,1.4535,10.0968,4.9322,1.6475,3.1068,0.1573,1.3684,6.1194,4.1145,1.6461,6.1926,3.4583,0.3554,0.1589,2.3649,0.1623,1.9657,2.2529,2.0591,5.1388,0.0602,0.0004,1.838,3.6055,0.1215,0.5646,4.0132,0.56,0.89,1.4032,0.1598,0.2229,0.0842,1.685,0.0558,4.8096,2.1221,0.2065,6.0764,6.0961,1.9429,3.4881,1.8782,3.4207,0.1387,5.7563,0.2497,0.838,1.0964,0.339,0.8135,1.7362,3.595,8.1737,2.7372,4.0774,5.287,0.0534,3.4313,5.6328,5.3207,0.8691,6.2389,3.6901,0.0338,0.0001,0.9758,2.1729,4.7534,0.7835,4.2804,0.0269,2.7203,7.3092,1.6248,0.9195,5.7033,2.7635,4.6601,2.7253,1.4494,8.8767,0.0183,2.2721,2.1387,0.5737,7.056,5.9573,5.5313,2.7259,7.9735,1.0918,0.0016,0.0001,1.019,3.7632,6.035,2.9492,3.3469,2.7109,0.4035,2.3603,0.4828,1.3593,4.1703,1.9471,4.1633,2.5968,1.9497,0.5357,1.0913,2.1873,3.8381,2.2305,6.6261,1.2278,0.3991,2.4126,7.4217,3.3792,0.7073,2.7919,2.2939,5.6759,2.023,3.7398,5.2669,5.0661,6.4607,1.2067,1.434,1.8805,0.8422,3.2118,2.7623,16.303,2.2135,0.721,1.1102,1.7311,2.6023,1.1755,1.9356,3.4802,1.5223,0.0779,2.8141,4.942,0.381,0.0396,0.8488,3.594,5.1716,4.874,3.6526,2.376,0.2517,2.2372,3.9935,0.6803,5.7381,0.1538,0.1241,1.0027,1.4888,2.2521,2.1211,1.0355,3.7307,4.9899,0.6493,0.1249,0.6071,3.4165,3.7714,1.0015,5.8883,0.189,5.3241,3.4946,0.431,1.8279,3.0033,3.4828,5.2506,2.0107,2.138,2.7997,2.1399,6.0789,3.7788,0.3193,2.2791,5.1542,1.9636,3.1416,2.865,7.1148,4.7266,0.4427,7.5199,1.345,5.6284,3.0657,4.2149,0.0015,3.9466,1.46,7.4937,0.0044,0.0016,0.0021,1.6324,1.9504,2.7648,0.1466,4.0735,0.5139,2.1037,4.5929,4.863,5.517,3.6705,3.2069,4.9166,0.0034,2.2851,0.555,4.2199,2.1038,3.9536,0.7026,3.6737,0.2146,1.2489,4.0732,3.4728,1.5169,1.9516,0.1123,0.036,2.724,2.31,0.5488,2.8994,1.2065,0.5607,5.6227,0.6091,0.6306,5.1614,7.5026,0.0015,3.908,5.9112,3.3004]}
{"prompt":"In the middle of Whirlpool Corp \u2019 s bustling washer factory in northern Ohio there is an empty patch of concrete floor - a reminder of a $ 60 million expansion plan the appliance maker","text":"In the middle of Whirlpool Corp \u2019 s bustling washer factory in northern Ohio there is an empty patch of concrete floor - a reminder of a $ 60 million expansion plan the appliance maker scrapped. But that may not be finalized. \u2014 Jason Taylor \/ Associated Press\nWhirlpool Corp. is moving to close and possibly sell its plants in Ohio, which makes about $ 1 billion in sales a year, its chairman and chief executive said Thursday.\nIn a letter to Whirlpool\u2019s workers, Peter Sullivan said that the company will consider plant closing or sale. The move comes as more and more manufacturers are taking plant closings off their corporate agendas. In recent years, automakers have scaled back major expansions. Other industries, such as pharmaceuticals, have downsized after investing in new products and global operations.\n\u201cThe timing of our decisions is difficult, but the cost of investing in the future is higher than making tough decisions today, \u201d he said in a letter circulated to the workforce at Whirlpool\u2019s Ohio assembly plants.\n\u201cWhat this means is that our operating plan for 2016, will look different than we have gone before. The path we are taking today will define our future performance and growth, \u201dSullivan said.\n\u201cFor those hard workers who have worked for us over the years, and for those new arrivals into the world of employment, it is with tears in our eyes that we leave. It is not easy. We miss this community of people we have known and cared for over the years and have built a career with. This is a good neighborhood. \u201c\nHe wrote that the changes would save a small percentage of the workforce, adding that the company would continue to invest in \u201cour shared vision about what our customer wants. \u201d\nThe company is looking to sell its operations in the Cincinnati area, home of its U.S. home appliances manufacturing and distribution complex, as well as to close production at plants in Louisville and Greenville, Ohio.","token_len":411,"entropy":[2.6222,5.0821,0.1746,10.9414,3.5666,0.0256,11.6883,12.4755,7.3764,7.9724,9.5517,9.6291,4.7192,5.1763,3.3594,6.4455,6.1,6.6929,3.0878,2.2695,4.9781,7.2578,0.2175,3.5101,4.2777,6.8986,2.8498,5.4095,0.5507,2.9264,7.2425,12.0609,0.8789,5.7317,2.7534,4.4321,11.1709,0.9269,7.4673,2.7373,4.3475,3.6576,4.8282,0.9163,0.6056,11.9971,2.0426,6.934,5.8312,6.6771,4.3767,3.836,0.0064,0.4905,21.2859,0.0039,0.0006,1.5908,1.2829,2.2476,3.9645,2.532,4.2177,5.7629,5.6584,4.0508,0.8219,5.3699,1.0261,2.027,1.3985,3.3015,4.8317,3.9243,1.8674,3.6454,1.0153,1.3054,2.6288,1.5674,0.0164,1.4173,4.6693,4.2367,2.175,0.919,0.0686,0.9536,2.223,0.2363,0.269,14.7711,1.4316,2.1997,0.4339,3.3611,0.0004,0.0008,11.8068,0.5482,0.8173,5.3418,0.524,7.1341,6.6396,2.2128,2.7226,1.4591,0.52,2.6542,4.5954,10.1837,2.8381,2.938,6.3425,2.3329,2.3457,2.8856,1.9057,1.5769,5.1456,2.9808,0.0009,3.9371,1.1036,4.2839,6.5969,1.1174,0.0131,3.4583,3.3203,6.3151,2.0127,0.7716,3.7791,3.3059,0.8388,0.1429,7.0726,0.8677,6.2144,0.0315,6.0341,3.6442,3.2167,7.4011,4.577,1.8325,0.8045,0.0008,4.1164,0.1835,0.8041,1.7933,8.2742,0.3747,4.7612,7.3603,1.6321,2.6319,4.3934,1.8073,9.3008,4.4721,0.3179,0.2876,5.3817,5.9521,5.5579,6.8759,0.3946,7.3308,5.97,1.2355,4.555,2.7062,0.4912,2.84,5.0332,0.687,5.3664,0.41,3.3729,1.9247,0.885,4.3576,0.2218,8.0657,7.9606,0.3918,2.4694,2.0546,8.0688,5.7581,3.0797,0.3679,2.8845,1.7884,3.1578,7.7911,0.9482,3.0504,4.0644,3.322,1.1226,0.0003,0.0003,3.0344,0.0086,0.0076,2.9759,5.288,1.9485,0.2282,0.7089,1.5813,0.6913,5.1812,3.8269,0.3646,1.0055,0.3169,3.0444,8.2645,2.9395,2.5619,4.4333,3.7205,6.0306,4.7171,1.8402,1.157,2.9179,2.3812,6.9422,4.2966,0.7675,2.7397,7.5708,1.213,2.0952,0.8148,4.0602,1.3723,7.2657,0.5455,0.793,5.9202,1.4444,4.4398,2.0863,3.2057,0.5579,9.0001,0.2652,0.2408,0.7451,0.8341,0.3652,4.3726,3.6465,8.7412,3.5367,0.9487,2.0506,2.3775,2.7535,1.8767,3.9958,0.3475,0.9626,0.3186,3.6207,2.1109,1.0704,5.097,5.8151,6.166,1.21,3.8556,0.5551,7.3663,0.471,2.4776,1.0194,4.3661,6.3459,0.5608,1.6399,0.011,0.2943,0.2138,4.5464,3.2023,4.0162,0.262,4.4711,2.9082,1.308,2.1533,6.5426,4.9963,4.7883,2.3847,2.122,3.0534,1.6449,2.3087,2.5628,4.2618,0.6474,4.1369,1.3981,0.2386,2.8112,3.0495,4.0194,1.963,5.8495,3.6495,0.5857,3.8823,0.9053,1.5907,6.0377,7.4053,1.5138,2.6765,0.908,3.1922,5.3921,5.0146,0.5268,1.4922,6.1169,4.8362,5.1165,3.8701,3.5702,2.2362,0.0361,1.024,2.0848,1.7033,4.7677,0.3056,1.4067,1.4757,1.4865,2.9996,0.1654,1.6328,0.3221,13.5745,0.5438,3.5846,6.9948,2.8856,7.676,2.8773,2.6653,6.3062,3.5061,1.3396,5.447,3.6918,0.2639,2.248,1.7884,2.3784,3.6014,1.0747,4.6615,1.5129,3.8299,1.305,2.667,5.1791,0.3791,1.3236,6.545,1.5231,2.3172,6.5914,0.1312,0.0118,0.166,7.0713,6.9171,2.3631,3.1103,3.4049,6.0001,0.881,3.2413,0.2786,0.0075,3.586,3.5376,5.4202,2.3195,4.4193,0.3481,4.5767,0.9076,6.4143,0.3156,0.616,3.2215,0.6457]}
{"prompt":"Britain said on Monday it would create a new national economic crime center to crack down harder on money laundering by drug dealers and people traffickers who are expected to net 90 billion pounds (","text":"Britain said on Monday it would create a new national economic crime center to crack down harder on money laundering by drug dealers and people traffickers who are expected to net 90 billion pounds ($142 billion) this year.\nThe government said it would raise the stakes on money laundering and drug trafficking by doubling the time it takes for offenders to move money, by making it harder for the public to report suspicious transactions, by cracking down on the online black market for the sale of illegal drugs and by taking advantage of more sophisticated new technologies.\n\"I am absolutely delighted that we are taking a harderline approach to money laundering and to help deal with organised crime,\" Home Secretary Theresa May told reporters. \"The more criminals can be shut down and stopped in their tracks, the less the country has to bear the costs of organised crime.\"\nThe government said efforts are made to catch up to the UK in the fight against cybercrime, which has led to the arrest of more than 1,000 people and the seizure of more than 3,400 computers. The government is hoping to achieve this by investing about 200 million pounds ($310 million) during the next three years.\nThe new unit will be based at GCHQ's headquarters in Wokingham, just outside London. GCHQ is Britain's intelligence agency, which is funded almost entirely from private donations.\nIn a speech at the Institute of Directors meeting in London, May said she has been looking at creating more effective national cybercrime operations for at least three years. But it has only started to see tangible results recently after the country joined international alliances such as the Tracking Terrorist Financing Group, the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Action Task Force.\nMay said last month that \"it would be unacceptable for government to get behind the back of law enforcement agencies.\"\nDrug dealers and traffickers, including some connected to Britain's top drugs syndicates, have been laundering millions of pounds in money sent from Britain for many years. Many of the criminals have used a complex network of British bank accounts to disguise the proceeds.","token_len":411,"entropy":[6.1584,3.1461,1.798,1.1264,1.452,5.6636,1.4229,1.8147,4.1747,6.956,8.0063,5.9758,1.6213,5.4775,0.0013,7.2741,0.0734,4.5191,0.0947,3.1615,4.6531,2.3033,1.3111,5.7994,4.4961,3.7977,2.4411,6.4793,0.015,9.0496,9.1451,4.3243,2.5285,0.4082,5.4958,0.1719,0.1372,4.161,0.0437,0.6121,0.1501,14.6043,4.2843,1.6074,0.6767,0.6662,5.2606,0.7832,7.8562,1.5667,4.8152,0.1829,2.9136,3.5246,0.8337,1.4377,6.5859,0.5967,6.8189,0.5541,0.7589,1.9696,6.0395,0.1298,4.667,2.1542,3.3034,4.5456,3.4204,0.4852,1.6472,0.4694,3.1991,4.0471,0.1998,3.5855,3.3962,0.8224,1.2941,2.8023,4.9053,0.0144,0.1216,2.9736,5.8643,3.906,0.1828,1.9654,4.2537,2.2252,0.0189,1.804,0.1411,0.5016,0.914,4.5594,5.3232,0.0009,4.9768,2.4368,6.1969,1.6364,0.9888,0.1202,1.5753,4.2266,1.8704,4.4962,1.9804,0.7723,1.333,1.5179,3.3053,2.8471,7.2678,5.7465,0.2103,0.4115,1.6944,0.0195,1.2255,3.9811,5.3004,5.8322,0.0539,4.9459,0.0687,1.1002,4.6638,0.3859,0.641,0.0036,1.5277,1.2193,1.2455,1.6377,2.4886,6.1127,3.2984,4.4123,0.8127,6.2321,1.2532,1.9804,4.0993,3.7028,1.1957,0.0147,0.3601,0.0685,2.6206,4.248,4.0028,2.5247,0.1101,6.5227,1.7923,1.5873,0.4346,5.6842,0.0505,0.6954,0.0984,1.3123,1.9981,1.2126,6.9841,4.635,5.6232,0.1957,5.5441,3.8484,1.533,1.1381,5.6636,3.696,2.3646,0.6767,0.0374,6.2921,0.9731,1.1291,2.1234,1.4832,3.9478,0.2151,1.9543,2.2455,0.5437,1.5222,0.0216,2.0751,0.2494,0.8958,0.7893,2.353,1.6322,2.0738,0.0309,1.1214,0.0026,3.1596,0.5725,3.3061,0.6507,1.144,2.8644,1.9475,2.7746,4.9438,0.5539,4.9863,1.5879,0.8563,5.6361,4.2697,6.3428,1.4539,0.0531,0.4436,4.3026,0.0232,0.0608,6.8352,0.6713,1.0201,1.7641,0.0939,1.2077,0.2115,1.3164,2.5377,5.0734,0.5088,1.3418,2.6143,0.7705,5.3626,2.1752,2.2752,1.8467,0.3315,6.3628,0.9821,2.8903,0.3939,4.8074,1.3407,0.0476,0.9762,5.7338,0.0022,1.6965,4.3667,0.0009,3.2097,0.8234,1.317,1.5077,1.6496,5.6195,6.4751,0.5784,3.2475,4.4982,0.5202,0.6308,0.6623,3.375,1.6196,3.4925,2.178,0.4613,4.8069,0.792,2.17,4.1606,0.8176,1.2532,1.0257,1.3518,0.5499,1.8401,4.4846,2.2342,4.3684,0.6744,5.6308,4.3334,3.5977,3.5419,4.3443,0.5788,4.9123,3.721,4.2947,0.0401,2.58,0.2689,0.7351,4.08,3.2846,2.6995,4.601,3.2398,0.9207,3.9782,3.5983,0.2067,4.7641,4.1877,1.5148,4.8485,5.4852,5.2207,8.5241,2.8233,0.0009,0.3215,13.9468,7.9156,0.092,2.9986,0.0072,3.1314,1.2719,2.0287,3.8199,2.7788,0.001,0.4776,0.3876,4.1677,1.7705,0.0059,0.0687,0.7714,0.3238,3.7398,0.9291,5.253,1.1896,0.432,3.4791,3.9481,2.4935,0.2825,5.66,1.4369,5.3756,0.8137,5.8647,4.8927,1.6961,6.1674,0.1622,5.8731,0.3384,1.946,3.9142,0.7234,8.7552,2.8349,1.3477,2.4321,3.0205,4.4814,2.8962,7.217,0.2276,3.5817,0.0275,3.933,5.4637,6.7985,0.5891,0.2505,1.5763,1.0257,9.2165,2.5069,0.119,0.0373,1.8368,3.9347,8.7629,1.9798,3.118,4.2235,5.4419,0.2094,0.6901,4.4002,0.7593,0.9655,5.203,2.6806,3.7179,3.7075,4.36,0.94,0.1233,6.7798,5.4464,0.1868,0.7192,5.412,2.539,4.3798,1.5386]}

Kevin McCarthy\u2019s wife, who is one of the few senior allies of Trump and has made repeated calls for tax reform.\nA second Republican lawmaker who dropped out had raised similar concerns, but a spokesman said the withdrawal had nothing to do with the tax bill.\nDemocrats have been working with the GOP to pass legislation in the House in recent days, in hopes of boosting the number of votes at a time when lawmakers are trying to salvage a $1.4 trillion U.S. economic stimulus bill, the next step in negotiations over the coronavirus pandemic.\nOne provision in the draft bill would eliminate a tax break for businesses that pay out at least $75,000 in dividends to shareholders in each of their five most recently taxable years, triggering a return of the tax credit.","token_len":411,"entropy":[9.3057,4.8272,1.2334,5.3246,2.9828,2.0168,2.7296,0.0012,0.011,0.0337,0.4358,0.4091,0.0012,3.7622,0.8169,5.0291,3.6931,0.0321,3.6316,0.0013,0.0136,0.0032,4.1822,1.5617,2.3557,1.87,0.9702,4.3384,1.8092,0.1022,0.0157,1.8957,4.8764,0.9136,1.7539,0.2839,4.2204,4.1598,5.5964,9.1084,2.4701,4.6912,0.6194,0.4264,4.6013,4.0465,6.4962,1.5257,7.5586,4.2313,2.4036,9.6067,2.0688,4.1411,9.9997,0.2327,1.0042,0.341,3.1826,4.3286,6.2079,3.3711,4.2719,4.0687,0.5636,0.1481,25.9917,0.6073,4.9894,1.7854,6.6378,1.9634,3.7009,4.1571,1.5251,0.0001,2.7739,3.6602,2.9409,6.2398,0.1239,0.3895,0.0196,2.407,7.2654,1.0869,0.4232,5.8369,2.6455,3.676,0.7089,7.4241,0.5306,3.0465,1.492,1.3331,5.9176,1.3479,5.7712,1.5909,2.5388,0.5993,0.3038,1.6751,2.0287,4.9614,0.0013,0.6618,0.4384,22.337,0.0021,0.0,5.3207,16.6192,8.5813,7.6725,4.3343,2.8026,7.3355,0.7518,1.4545,1.1082,0.7162,1.8488,3.032,1.1824,3.1596,2.7011,5.4338,0.7268,1.1473,3.4166,1.4948,0.3046,0.6658,2.3123,0.1102,0.6053,1.8334,5.1747,1.6868,2.3038,1.3702,7.7992,0.0033,1.2916,6.1923,2.167,1.9792,1.0782,2.5693,0.0008,1.1302,5.9384,0.1205,1.5283,2.3008,1.1546,5.1356,1.9705,2.5489,4.1879,0.0227,4.5507,6.5834,0.9121,2.0261,0.0791,2.664,0.7508,5.1554,2.3351,0.013,0.0096,0.4315,4.664,0.1495,4.3581,0.6407,0.0004,6.4357,0.6399,5.8366,1.0658,0.0057,1.0995,4.6032,3.6625,3.5131,0.1219,4.2759,2.8824,0.001,5.699,2.5492,2.6837,3.4793,3.1264,15.4237,8.2528,2.2926,8.373,1.2892,0.7659,0.3221,2.1368,5.8757,1.4951,5.4629,5.0732,1.2962,6.4521,1.6111,5.3465,1.1519,3.4241,3.954,6.2903,0.0249,2.9434,0.3789,7.0665,6.8044,2.4193,2.016,4.2987,1.251,3.2533,1.252,4.7394,3.1452,3.4374,2.6282,1.7211,0.0348,2.8413,5.4199,2.6151,2.6354,0.2948,2.1815,4.0871,1.7801,4.6419,5.5573,0.0634,5.4003,2.2198,0.0024,3.7201,3.0607,7.4839,5.0949,7.3033,4.9085,0.5639,4.0978,1.5887,4.8063,0.0154,0.8266,3.6024,5.6391,8.256,0.4225,0.8486,2.6172,1.9671,4.548,6.0597,1.8191,0.6597,2.6125,0.0542,0.8776,0.6258,4.0419,3.6093,2.4011,0.7661,3.0872,3.9644,0.0294,4.8661,5.2473,3.7338,0.3091,1.451,1.8574,4.6999,2.1784,2.4629,1.2639,4.6437,3.5005,1.4329,0.0059,0.0041,0.0018,1.4051,3.5541,0.3138,0.5377,0.2808,4.621,1.6604,1.8257,3.613,3.5301,2.1067,2.6002,0.9854,2.1037,2.4333,3.4571,0.8028,1.5303,4.2333,0.9362,1.9014,1.2264,4.9224,2.7576,0.3269,5.3356,1.9966,3.8093,0.0173,2.3733,5.9439,2.1396,1.1819,0.112,3.7652,0.5959,2.8935,0.0165,5.8575,1.7855,4.4906,1.1703,1.2937,2.1218,0.019,3.874,0.0007,0.0012,0.0048,5.3546,1.9867,2.9274,3.1493,3.0165,6.9717,2.596,0.5141,4.9593,1.681,1.626,15.7719,0.0007,0.0037,5.9055,0.0024,0.3787,0.2435,5.4745,5.0046,1.8991,0.0969,7.6346,1.2105,1.8431,3.534,2.3502,2.5235,2.6027,0.4385,3.8756,0.6758,3.4705,4.8032,5.0303,0.2067,0.7498,5.1535,0.4888,0.0108,0.75,3.2842,2.2133,2.616,3.4381,5.6526,1.4712,1.9439,4.1701,6.0939,3.5617,5.4953,0.3559,1.6648,6.9313,0.7214,5.4004,1.535,2.681,1.7324,3.1117,1.228]}

three weeks earlier than he had planned.\nAnd when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced he was stepping down from that post earlier this month, his successor was unclear for weeks.\nBut the prime minister on Friday decided to postpone a formal decision on the matter to August, leaving the matter to a new government, as he hopes to avoid being seen as abandoning his goal to revive growth and reduce a government debt that has crept up at the expense of public confidence.\nMr Tsutomu Nagamine, a lawmaker in the opposition Democratic Party, said some Cabinet members and bureaucrats had told him that some of the proposals that have come up in discussions since the change in government in April were not suitable and that it would be better if the prime minister held a delay election later in 2018.\nBut Mr Tsutomu Nagamine said he was not certain he would get the support to trigger such a ballot.\nPrime Minister Abe has repeatedly said the country should hold elections, and has been talking increasingly about delaying a decision to avoid the possibility that some politicians seeking high office could block his efforts to revive the economy.\nHe told Parliament on Thursday that in the near term, he wants to be sure the economy is not hindered by an election.\nAt the same time, he said, an election could do little to increase public confidence as the government moves to implement the spending plan the new Cabinet was formed on.\n\"I think we need to make sure the economy is not hindered by the change in government, \" he said, calling the delay vote a \"precautionary measure\".\nThe delay vote could force a new election to be held before the end of next year, possibly on Dec 3, a year after the planned one, in a vote for the lower house, the Diet, or the lower house could put up a majority for an extension.","token_len":412,"entropy":[10.8784,5.2868,0.0078,0.0438,3.3728,5.2043,2.473,4.7022,2.3011,0.0842,0.2481,9.2967,3.1656,0.3783,3.4159,5.9504,9.8099,8.0632,6.0886,1.1799,9.6342,0.0648,1.3258,4.8232,0.6421,4.4866,0.0061,3.2444,0.9828,3.5926,3.9046,0.2837,2.2329,3.1923,2.5809,1.5745,5.0712,7.0772,4.3635,2.8062,4.257,0.058,3.5497,1.7564,0.4473,0.3996,0.4694,15.1344,4.7094,5.5058,0.0025,0.0836,0.0045,3.2896,2.2962,1.3835,0.545,0.0798,2.5404,4.7921,1.1382,4.4121,0.1334,0.6627,0.117,2.6896,2.1467,2.5263,6.9568,6.2071,3.8032,1.0389,0.165,2.6025,2.2413,4.3452,0.0201,4.7759,1.7275,6.1037,0.2898,5.9303,2.1483,4.2249,2.2328,1.1923,1.475,2.7772,3.26,5.1121,2.916,4.1605,1.4779,3.7835,1.2519,2.9656,2.7196,2.919,2.4258,3.9357,2.5783,5.6668,0.3884,2.7866,4.3364,2.5063,0.1553,5.0821,0.8367,5.3411,2.4493,3.1489,6.327,1.8899,4.2132,5.794,4.522,3.8223,2.7989,1.179,6.7057,0.7414,4.5541,2.4992,1.3858,0.0025,2.2747,6.0578,0.547,0.0721,5.2316,5.9899,4.2447,0.0582,0.0329,7.8156,6.0574,0.538,2.3322,4.5838,2.7608,0.4841,2.3895,1.4465,0.4877,0.8128,0.776,7.3584,3.5802,1.4841,4.0183,4.6078,1.3993,3.9762,0.1282,2.0971,5.9198,1.859,0.8251,4.8437,3.2374,3.0784,3.2513,2.5673,1.8917,3.8258,4.8124,1.5265,5.8523,1.1121,1.7948,4.175,2.7306,1.1755,1.8976,3.9497,3.4653,1.38,3.2988,1.2508,0.3081,1.893,2.1972,1.6749,3.9276,0.0067,4.7639,1.2908,8.6879,7.1795,4.1679,1.6002,3.2768,0.3374,0.1529,2.9453,1.2904,0.7604,0.042,0.0009,0.0008,1.7297,0.003,0.7506,1.177,1.68,1.792,4.6465,3.8487,0.6228,3.7181,1.3245,3.7251,3.7304,6.5084,3.765,0.1251,5.2033,1.3115,0.3902,5.0388,0.0197,1.1693,2.1181,3.6292,1.3189,2.5845,3.2869,3.28,4.492,3.1046,3.4951,2.0406,2.686,2.9543,5.9029,7.7217,0.6994,5.5057,2.7399,1.8735,2.3487,6.9053,2.6623,2.8809,3.1555,4.3646,5.4366,8.6529,6.7124,0.396,1.639,6.291,1.9093,4.0561,0.9852,1.3436,1.6557,0.3747,0.3844,0.254,2.6535,3.8099,7.0079,0.9591,1.6621,0.3247,5.1533,1.3448,4.2182,1.7014,0.769,1.0372,3.829,0.2942,4.5893,3.1667,1.7507,1.6029,1.6669,3.2543,8.223,0.4091,4.0455,2.6334,1.3094,0.4239,5.4549,0.8401,0.4621,0.0277,0.102,0.4885,0.5951,1.8936,5.6286,0.669,2.5183,6.8072,2.2428,0.1879,4.1971,2.4636,0.2581,4.9393,1.7984,1.8896,4.5805,1.207,4.3974,2.166,4.7312,1.7566,4.5663,3.7521,4.5062,3.4006,5.4262,2.4448,0.7436,0.2203,1.2711,1.7801,1.99,2.3676,1.6498,0.3944,3.0255,0.4891,1.8754,0.9868,0.5683,1.2556,1.9499,0.3236,2.5744,3.7424,0.27,0.3645,2.4334,7.7903,0.5649,0.1733,1.9452,4.7842,1.9471,4.6818,5.386,1.2976,0.4991,5.1569,1.9862,0.0004,0.0024,3.2903,1.0118,0.2156,2.0002,4.4882,0.5622,3.6232,5.673,2.4876,2.2727,2.2745,2.8768,0.8477,0.1702,3.6169,1.1055,0.6475,0.0013,2.4183,0.4432,0.7114,5.4576,3.0419,5.4695,5.4139,0.9179,4.5482,3.0884,0.7921,0.778,6.2793,4.4153,2.2367,3.6866,2.8567,4.8243,5.1579,1.5103,4.9385,0.0867,2.6799,1.9159,1.6621,1.592,3.936,1.3636,2.8477,0.1177,7.6396,6.2389,3.9761,0.8564,3.8882,2.6402,3.6895,4.4101,1.904]}

The inquiry is part of a criminal investigation by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether officials at the U.S. intelligence organization were misleading the president.\nThe inquiry was triggered when Mr. Mueller, appointed last year by President Barack Obama, said that his investigation into Russian interference would not include allegations of obstruction of justice against Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly denied any impropriety.\nThe bank has long been the target of political pressure from Democrats to reveal customer information, including Trump\u2019s, so the inquiry comes as little surprise to many.\nA spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, the third world\u2019s biggest private bank, said on Thursday she could not discuss the matter because it was in the early stages of an ongoing criminal investigation.\nShe said the bank had complied with requests from U.S. law enforcement and provided sensitive information on its customers. The person familiar with the inquiry said it was not known what the bank had provided the investigators this week.\nMr. Mueller is preparing final indictments against 14 Russians for allegedly hacking the DNC\u2019s voting machines, a tactic likely to hurt Republican hopes of taking back Congress in the 2018 midterm elections.\nBut the FBI, in its report to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said it needed to get at more of the Trump campaign\u2019s files in order to better understand the allegations.\nRussia, the West's leading critic of President Vladimir Putin, says it hacked into a DNC server during the 2016 election and was trying to influence how U.S. voters cast ballots.","token_len":412,"entropy":[6.9563,0.6281,0.0806,0.0846,5.5676,6.586,5.381,3.0641,1.9129,1.2222,0.1206,0.2674,0.3009,1.9811,0.0002,0.0057,0.033,0.4099,0.092,6.7137,7.3992,0.0987,4.8964,7.8128,3.5317,4.0288,5.3831,0.8767,0.22,0.1846,1.8679,4.8935,0.7622,6.0398,2.094,0.2489,5.3301,0.9074,0.0567,1.8779,0.6121,1.3892,1.6179,3.6074,2.8489,0.1127,0.0013,0.0662,5.0618,0.5096,1.3815,2.1317,0.1073,0.425,13.4349,1.0564,2.8733,4.0892,1.3501,1.6626,1.6066,0.7667,3.2005,2.3355,4.3575,2.6162,1.9741,5.0311,0.9886,8.4087,4.8807,0.7771,7.1131,1.686,2.2715,4.2246,3.2974,0.004,3.8757,5.2115,3.8319,4.2615,3.5332,7.7903,0.052,1.8051,0.8212,1.2475,3.8444,0.0998,0.1286,2.5524,5.8305,1.4932,3.3008,0.0024,0.7822,3.8874,0.8217,2.1671,1.7432,0.0007,0.0044,0.0029,4.68,0.1124,0.0299,0.0137,1.563,1.396,0.9443,0.0851,0.1038,0.8048,1.0931,1.6383,2.8607,3.8023,3.9599,0.5799,3.6372,0.0002,0.0029,0.0251,2.5221,9.3143,1.9529,7.5374,0.7708,6.2995,1.8532,0.2073,2.5446,4.4046,2.4022,5.109,2.6761,4.4687,0.0129,3.1338,2.7046,3.6962,3.1617,0.9738,0.6553,0.3337,0.8343,0.0095,0.4134,3.4881,2.2147,3.6814,2.0526,1.077,1.0708,1.3644,5.6404,1.6689,2.8181,4.6548,0.6192,4.7956,0.1447,0.0061,4.5889,1.1457,0.0003,0.0216,1.5348,1.242,1.0617,2.8483,0.5785,0.8442,9.555,0.0013,0.5897,0.6404,0.3815,1.3229,3.6326,2.1557,4.8967,1.5231,3.0857,1.3811,0.0066,4.4541,2.4601,0.8913,2.5249,3.2578,4.5483,8.7002,1.216,1.7849,1.4292,4.5228,14.562,9.3839,0.7646,3.4424,6.4487,2.1338,2.4931,5.1004,1.2959,3.725,0.0462,1.8104,2.5585,1.8772,0.6307,4.0592,2.8128,0.0716,0.6862,0.1211,2.7886,3.4819,5.505,7.2553,10.4011,1.2211,1.5832,1.6271,4.9206,0.3472,0.2902,0.9907,2.2734,0.6058,4.2471,2.0477,0.0411,3.0633,0.5468,1.242,1.7106,1.4151,0.6555,3.1634,0.7102,3.3978,0.0414,0.1539,2.603,2.3001,0.9918,0.4299,0.3425,0.4259,6.0271,0.9638,1.0222,0.8038,1.8095,5.1606,0.1507,2.9955,1.468,2.7982,0.0004,0.0026,0.0015,1.9353,0.0179,1.7882,6.0043,5.441,0.9089,2.3482,2.5235,0.9124,1.1992,2.599,3.1393,2.3181,0.0078,0.0639,1.8075,0.8066,2.6042,0.794,1.8616,4.1127,2.2627,1.8245,1.5099,1.7721,2.009,2.3841,5.4627,7.1561,0.8941,0.3008,0.23,2.5357,0.0004,1.1483,2.3002,6.415,9.0398,2.8533,0.0001,1.6978,6.7109,4.8225,2.9383,2.8991,5.7272,1.5513,2.8563,7.9372,0.2596,0.005,6.6319,1.4652,1.7834,3.2019,5.9576,6.8849,0.8269,4.0519,4.4044,2.9719,0.7328,3.4593,1.1549,3.0032,1.6102,1.9599,1.101,0.5247,0.0288,0.1774,0.6628,3.8528,1.6285,3.3855,3.323,2.701,1.763,4.1361,2.4733,6.7902,0.0023,0.0905,0.0003,0.9065,0.6907,1.24,6.399,1.0972,3.87,3.5967,3.8661,3.5598,0.3832,4.4773,1.6595,6.11,0.1035,0.0014,6.4986,3.2529,0.2589,0.0212,4.7362,0.4737,1.4624,5.9931,0.7341,0.4965,6.489,3.3768,2.4547,5.4808,0.492,1.8441,5.1708,0.0476,2.6026,0.7676,0.8649,0.3449,4.6948,0.9678,3.5279,1.5309,3.6768,4.3846,1.1403,4.6283,0.1142,0.9992,0.7898,1.7069,3.6089,2.7683,0.0101,1.462,5.5844,3.8173,0.0003,0.0024,0.0013,3.2932,1.8752,1.7339,0.4363]}

Council is conducting its annual session in a manner that has, at worst, criminalized the nuclear policies of the DPRK ( North Korea ) - a country that, unlike the vast majority of countries in the world, has never engaged in the practice of nuclear war, \u201d the North said in a statement delivered to the council. \u201c This is an unprecedented unprecedented measure that violates basic and universal human rights. \u201c The council \u201c should immediately stop adopting unilateral measures that are intended to impose sanctions on North Korea that amount to genocide, \u201d it said, calling for an end to so-called UN-sanctions. \u201c The United States, the main sponsor of UN sanctions policy, should immediately put an end to the violation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms in North Korea and should fully respect the basic international norms of human rights. \u201d The council also took the unusual step of declaring its support for the \u201c human rights of North Korean ethnic groups \u201d. The UN said it would hold a public debate on the human rights situation in North Korea at the end of its session. The US State Department on Thursday reiterated a call on the UN Human Rights Council to condemn the North Korean army's treatment of people captured on February 23. \" The UN must condemn the government for the treatment of the captured soldiers,\u201d the State Department said in a statement. The United Nations human rights body met on Thursday and adopted a draft resolution urging member countries to hold North Korea accountable in its human rights violations, specifically \u201c the treatment of detainees, arbitrary detention, torture, and the use of arbitrary force, \u201d among others.

Binali Yildirim met","text":"Turkey s prime minister on Wednesday dubbed the killing of minority Muslim Rohingyas in Myanmar by its security forces genocide and urged the international community to ensure their safety back home. Binali Yildirim met the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva on Wednesday and shared some developments in his country with the UN human rights body, urging it to do everything within its power to find out the truth about the events and investigate cases of violence. Yildirim emphasized the crucial role of the UN and the international community in ensuring that justice would prevail. The Prime minister highlighted the need for international community to step forward before the genocide against the Rohingya community takes place. Yildirim said it is the only country in the region that suffered such a genocide in Myanmar and he reiterated the need for the international community to put pressure on the Burmese regime for the safety of the Rohingyas. He also called on the UN Security Council to assume a relevant role in this case and demanded that there should be an independent probe under the UN to establish facts so that genocide can be tried once there is no doubt about it. Yildirim said that he had told the UN Human Rights chief that the international community needed to do everything it could to ensure the safety of the Rohingyas who had taken refuge in neighbouring countries and to prevent any discrimination against them. The Foreign Minister added that the international community had a moral obligation to stop the atrocities against the Rohingya. Yildirim said the international community had not done enough to protect human rights around the globe despite its success in the protection of human rights in its own countries. The prime minister said Turkey has always believed and adhered to human rights. He said this was not only one country but a universally held value. He said some countries had also been responsible for violations of human rights and said all of those who committed crimes against humanity would be held accountable under international law.

The bill would apply to ads that appear on any online platform that does not operate its own campaign ad server, McCain said.\n\u201cWe need a more robust framework for regulating Internet ads because online disinformation costs us votes. The bill would require disclosure of how advertising goes to fund disinformation,\u201d he added, while stressing that the legislation would not apply if the ad platform was run by the publisher.\nThe legislation was introduced the week before by Sen. Bernie Sanders, Democrat of Vermont, and it was backed by more than a dozen Democrats.\nAmong the companies that have expressed concerns over the legislation are big tech companies, such as Alphabet, which owns Google, PayPal, and Facebook.\n\u201cWe are not a party to this discussion, to push this legislation,\u201d said Brian Wieser, CEO of PayPal Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything we can do at this time.\u201d\nThe legislation has faced opposition from several major online platforms, including Twitter and Microsoft, and it was blocked from being pushed further in the House of Representatives.","token_len":413,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,8.7895,1.9363,1.5292,4.8622,3.3949,8.7298,0.2227,0.8883,6.0792,4.8423,2.8886,4.3036,1.388,4.0953,1.3677,0.5921,3.724,10.6602,4.0436,4.7791,2.4858,0.6733,4.4978,3.3034,0.2877,1.1494,10.5185,3.924,4.6984,2.1509,0.0536,2.7845,1.1611,5.1204,5.1612,0.0893,2.017,8.9969,3.177,0.3861,0.2126,14.5188,2.0904,4.2132,4.277,0.1808,1.614,3.8788,0.3731,6.38,2.0958,7.7577,2.0995,2.2735,0.9103,2.9293,0.8775,3.6013,0.0682,1.028,1.9313,1.7219,1.5322,1.0673,1.5802,2.0867,0.1895,3.2693,0.4344,5.6584,1.7779,5.8856,12.6863,9.4535,7.1884,8.0202,4.6712,7.2696,6.215,1.7732,2.7738,0.9061,0.8305,0.3194,2.2789,1.0809,0.7191,0.8147,8.0291,2.5036,6.8885,3.9452,1.2888,2.9937,4.0624,0.3404,0.0157,2.0212,1.8247,3.0601,4.7302,0.5303,1.0028,3.0775,3.9224,4.898,2.5257,1.9345,8.8528,6.1828,9.4974,0.4701,1.0426,0.1599,0.1309,0.3816,3.8933,0.3959,9.5285,3.4252,2.5928,5.566,5.7388,2.9632,5.2382,2.9158,1.7483,1.4114,4.4631,6.3699,3.4258,6.538,6.4303,0.2266,0.2385,5.357,0.8487,3.9399,2.7915,3.2801,1.852,2.558,0.0576,2.621,0.2642,1.7678,1.7882,1.504,1.2495,1.427,3.4285,3.7444,2.1205,3.4928,0.084,5.0328,1.4071,1.7435,7.2731,2.5125,3.7034,2.5605,0.6208,2.0007,0.1361,0.5477,3.0485,4.088,0.582,1.5216,2.6534,1.7916,1.1837,0.6949,2.7992,3.5425,0.3305,2.1916,3.0728,4.0345,0.3962,2.5887,0.6985,1.4352,2.1383,1.9566,1.4529,4.8483,0.5924,3.527,0.8302,3.2941,0.3613,3.9949,2.9038,1.426,2.23,3.2156,0.0284,6.6616,5.1643,0.1625,6.4767,3.5606,5.0384,1.4201,9.7055,0.1826,0.2254,0.2749,1.8071,0.2112,3.4431,2.9545,2.9287,3.762,1.5512,4.919,0.7208,3.0749,4.5554,3.1891,4.5991,3.1509,10.6592,7.155,2.9825,9.758,1.7724,2.9402,3.4736,1.4053,1.4299,5.3284,0.296,3.37,5.103,6.7413,1.5012,5.535,7.1496,2.6731,1.0891,0.6977,2.4325,2.0076,3.4787,4.2721,6.4223,0.2911,1.3084,2.2159,1.371,0.8019,3.1394,5.3748,1.7083,4.1981,5.4483,2.4999,3.485,0.2386,2.7753,5.4581,0.9024,0.1891,1.834,2.317,2.1435,1.4855,5.5033,4.2054,0.9321,7.3099,2.4892,0.0022,3.2141,0.0033,1.0112,5.7368,0.0197,0.0065,0.6398,1.2804,6.4757,1.5967,3.5505,0.0517,3.6251,0.0112,2.9359,0.0879,2.4373,1.1323,0.6888,6.0867,0.6003,5.63,0.7326,1.9445,3.0834,4.0143,2.9017,0.4263,1.8722,1.2909,7.6924,1.8939,0.303,1.8791,2.3534,0.0015,3.6972,1.0799,3.2565,2.3141,1.7858,0.6763,6.9505,0.5384,1.6442,1.097,0.644,0.7396,2.8909,0.2336,2.6156,3.3025,3.5116,4.1322,1.3408,0.569,1.9336,6.3206,1.4005,6.5659,6.7117,3.58,1.0434,1.9033,1.4741,1.7799,1.6538,4.1962,4.6733,2.6478,1.6488,0.0605,2.5905,0.09,7.1362,7.6316,0.8828,9.8517,0.1133,2.9248,3.8894,5.3605,0.1699,0.4715,3.0694,0.0197,0.7406,3.5185,7.9785,9.3243,0.0466,2.942,4.6402,2.8521,2.318,0.408,4.4069,0.2237,1.5027,2.1617,1.0679,1.7523,0.1874,2.0702,2.05,3.12,3.8625,1.8982,0.3099,3.4005,2.9341,3.9889,2.4101,0.8986,0.2693,2.3744,1.399,5.2096,0.8809,1.8504,2.0045,2.3377,4.1022,2.6284,2.4554,4.673,5.2701,2.1164,0.2673,1.8286,1.5595,0.0118,0.933]}

Babis s ANO party finished first in a November election win by about 7 percent and formed an open coalition with the Communist Party of the Czech Republic ( KDU-CSL) for a short nine-month period before the incumbent government resigned on Nov. 23. The prime minister said a new coalition would be formed soon. He did not elaborate, however, whether he would seek support from the KDU-CSL. Babis has said the government will be replaced as soon as the ANO vote of confidence passes with a majority of deputies. It was the first vote of confidence Babis has attempted since succeeding pro-Western former President Vaclav Klaus in August in what many commentators have viewed as a coup. The current parliamentary elections scheduled for Saturday will be the first since a government resigned after Klaus\u2019 exit. According to the European Monitoring Center for Political Violence in South Eastern Europe, violence before, during and after these elections will be high.

According to Hong Kong\u2019s New York-based think tank the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), the Central People\u2019s Government ordered all media outlets in Hong Kong to disclose the exact locations of their media workers and make sure they have been sent on official trips and meetings. The move means that no more classified information, no more confidential information like meeting locations. According to the CPR director, Mr. Daniel Leung, the Chinese government is going to close down any media outlet that does not abide by those regulations. On Monday, the mainland authorities announced that they would not renew the licenses of any Hong Kong media institutions whose staff were not properly identified and those that did not report their trips to their headquarters.

Port operations across","text":"Salvage efforts continued on Monday to remove a sunken drydock in an industrial portion of the Houston Ship Channel, home to major oil refineries and petrochemical plants, officials said. Port operations across the Houston area were restored after Sunday's emergency shutdown. A spokesperson at Houston Ship Channel Authority said Friday that the dock at the intersection of Wetmore Street and Canal View Avenue was destroyed by flooding Wednesday night. Authorities evacuated about 1,500 people from an area in Central and Western Houston as well as a portion of College Station. The dock housed an equipment park and dock operations. Most employees left the facility as the water rose above the dock's foundation, officials said. A port official said two employees were injured when they got stuck on a roof. The dock was home to the BNSF Railway, which has been operating from a temporary facility. The BNSF Railway said on its website that the storm damage was a \"minor incident.\" Port operations, including oil spill cleanup, continued on Monday. At least three oil pipeline barge crews were dispatched to clean up oil from the disaster, federal officials said Monday. Residents in Houston area evacuated as rain and winds continue to batter Houston\u2019s low-lying areas. Houston firefighters worked atop high-rises to combat a blazing building fire late Sunday night. The flames came from a vacant apartment building in Austin, which authorities evacuated amid torrential rains. The Houston Fire Department received a call at 10:40 p.m. from a homeowner who observed flames leaping from the upper levels of a home on East Houston Boulevard.

Ted Cruz ( Texas ) said \u201cwe have to pass a taxoverhaul bill\u201d in his 2016 campaign.\n\u201cThe White House considers the idea seriously, but they haven\u2019t said whether it means a Senate overhaul, \u201d Miller said.\nHe added that such a scenario would also involve a Republican winning re-election to the Senate next year.\n\u201cIf this bill comes out with some type of tax overhauler as the primary goal, the Republicans need to win back enough seats to get that done,\u201d he said.\nThe taxoverhaul bill that Trump called for in his 2016 campaign would have raised corporate profits, but has not yet obtained traction in Congress.\nA lot depends on what tax overhaul legislation is passed, according to Trump. If that is the case, Miller said that the White House could continue to \u201cfocus on a Senate overhaul this year or next or as many years as it takes\u201d to produce one.\nThe Republican tax overhaul plan that he advocated was to lower taxes on corporations and individuals. The Democrats prefer that the tax burden on the wealthy and businesses remain the same, not reduced.","token_len":414,"entropy":[7.2138,0.1791,6.056,0.5664,3.6654,2.1783,5.4753,6.6591,1.305,0.588,1.953,0.0006,0.0119,0.0243,0.7413,3.6271,2.8375,3.7585,3.6056,3.8586,1.1354,4.0454,1.7806,3.2546,1.8445,2.8891,3.6322,4.9323,1.1337,1.8834,1.778,1.9966,6.2757,2.1795,1.9848,4.3856,2.5033,2.0141,6.2268,1.8506,1.5166,1.0652,0.0948,21.9303,2.5461,5.1484,4.031,5.149,0.0651,1.5852,5.1797,0.057,2.0524,4.6405,1.915,5.6731,1.1542,2.524,3.5588,1.109,1.3536,4.3598,20.6488,8.6488,5.6169,3.0123,0.0005,0.771,3.8004,7.4055,0.1248,0.1361,5.4462,0.6839,0.0001,1.2904,3.798,0.7725,0.0758,5.2599,2.9944,1.9566,2.3915,1.0304,3.982,3.4873,3.6965,0.569,0.3441,14.3494,6.3002,8.4429,8.5356,5.7741,5.9096,4.0989,4.7679,3.6476,2.6985,5.115,2.2395,1.9215,1.8254,3.8381,3.1285,7.3879,9.0441,1.4152,4.9109,0.0244,1.1514,3.6704,0.4563,5.4718,1.9372,0.4213,2.5833,3.8044,0.0042,5.8753,12.837,4.2466,0.779,8.6399,1.8677,6.2281,0.0058,3.9979,1.5318,4.0495,1.1148,0.4042,6.4319,0.4318,1.252,3.21,3.0599,4.7965,5.932,3.6388,0.0792,0.1815,4.8872,1.6992,2.5313,0.6274,0.8631,3.6496,2.0982,4.5168,0.6563,1.15,4.0181,14.2852,2.3133,6.8036,0.8599,14.5712,0.4025,3.1978,2.5659,1.7512,3.5533,6.3685,0.6777,1.6677,0.0211,0.982,1.4437,2.4181,2.176,3.8386,3.2456,3.6073,5.5671,2.8371,6.8191,0.0675,2.4163,0.002,1.3941,9.1439,0.3123,2.9607,8.4807,1.4588,4.12,3.0693,0.7515,3.5258,0.6512,1.2399,14.654,5.705,1.3755,0.9221,2.2896,2.8221,2.9548,4.7759,1.7277,0.7508,0.2652,1.7566,0.608,2.4638,3.1922,0.0007,7.5237,1.8657,0.4967,6.9242,1.5171,2.954,4.5912,3.4957,2.9885,4.2871,0.0415,3.343,1.4049,1.7114,6.001,1.5072,3.2047,4.8426,2.9227,6.6532,3.8756,5.4668,0.6793,0.3183,0.2544,5.5622,1.2303,0.6974,4.6782,0.2271,5.1068,1.2196,4.2176,3.7197,1.4247,2.6413,5.6602,2.6357,0.0201,0.007,3.1964,0.2486,0.5812,4.2587,0.1113,0.7176,0.2611,0.9736,0.4247,2.858,4.1084,3.4828,3.5174,3.0481,3.9971,3.2023,5.714,0.004,2.4335,1.3756,6.799,5.1808,2.3726,4.1259,2.8132,0.2775,2.9188,4.1802,5.0838,0.4688,1.9158,1.9912,4.2983,2.1902,0.5068,2.8597,3.924,1.0938,1.0247,0.522,1.0087,2.7563,0.2303,0.069,0.2291,2.617,4.404,11.1538,0.0061,1.338,3.4622,1.617,5.2589,0.6686,2.0003,0.7677,3.1375,0.3863,2.1429,2.8213,2.6456,6.4281,4.6029,2.5581,4.0487,5.3956,1.5877,1.9463,8.8912,5.4986,0.7459,1.6775,0.5438,0.6452,4.2657,5.4687,4.0188,0.0388,2.6602,4.1129,1.5912,2.0604,2.1449,2.2386,1.7599,3.9399,0.0036,4.5673,1.0612,4.0961,4.154,3.472,2.1496,0.421,0.0666,5.6698,0.2493,3.6249,2.0301,2.3203,0.0008,2.4371,5.3841,0.4853,13.2107,0.3477,4.3086,0.1652,2.9034,3.9535,2.5657,6.8994,0.4704,3.6106,0.9451,6.7102,5.8294,5.6721,2.4539,1.0619,1.5507,2.6842,4.2871,1.9324,2.0832,5.7878,3.198,0.2848,0.2215,2.8298,4.0107,1.9217,0.7561,2.4207,3.3109,3.4463,5.412,3.2549,5.3756,3.7637,1.4821,0.6092,3.1186,1.1181,1.2805,2.1062,2.4174,6.4898,8.1252,4.0535,2.0787,2.3735,5.4961,2.135,1.1738,1.7632,4.1149,4.5228,3.8352,2.3098,0.0055,1.0841,5.8605,4.431,0.9065]}
{"prompt":"The arrest of two Reuters journalists in Yangon this week was a signal that press freedom is shrinking in Myanmar and the international community must do all it can to get them released , U.N.","text":"The arrest of two Reuters journalists in Yangon this week was a signal that press freedom is shrinking in Myanmar and the international community must do all it can to get them released, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said Monday.\nWitnesses say Reuters reporters Michael Gartenburg and Dave Palmer were detained by police early Monday after they took a photograph of a government official entering a restaurant with a tray of coffees. The photo, taken by Palmer, was later used in a widely distributed media story regarding an apparent scandal surrounding one of Myanmar's prominent generals.\nThe photograph showed the general sitting with his back to a small table holding a tray of coffees. His colleague's seat, to the right of the coffee table, was also empty.\nThe image prompted an official probe and the resignation of the general, who is reported to have owned the place where the photograph was taken. Palmer and Gartenburg were arrested soon after the photo was given to media outlets around the world.\nThe Reuters photo also caused a wave of protests in Myanmar, and the two journalists have been accused of \"embezzling\" by the country's military. A third photographer, Nick Ut, was killed in Iraq in 2006 and Reuters has said there is no connection between the events.\nThe U.N. official said he hoped the arrest of the journalists would raise awareness and pressure within the government and military on freedom of speech and to allow independent media.\nHe also said the news showed that journalists have to be vigilant not only about getting a photograph that might arouse suspicion, but also about protecting their own safety.\n\"When it comes to being journalists they may face danger at the hands of the government, so we have to think about how they can be protected in the first place,\" Zeid said. \"The international community should not hesitate in helping them.\"\nThe UN official said he hoped the arrest of the journalists would raise awareness and pressure within the government and military on freedom of speech and to allow independent media.","token_len":414,"entropy":[9.9675,1.1616,4.1808,9.8373,0.4963,1.6909,9.0836,0.0179,3.9213,0.5166,2.1001,2.1422,6.0674,1.0372,8.3089,0.3222,1.2926,7.2348,1.6867,4.1119,2.7008,2.258,3.8657,0.1032,2.1055,3.2854,5.3433,0.1151,0.0028,0.039,5.0867,3.935,4.0307,2.3627,6.0981,0.0796,0.7225,0.0315,3.608,0.0039,0.1051,0.0204,0.001,0.3675,0.0003,0.0002,0.0007,0.0002,0.2311,0.0003,0.3253,3.3147,0.2527,0.2213,23.8377,0.0663,2.666,4.2025,2.3186,7.9455,5.4081,5.4105,8.8879,0.2447,7.2861,5.2308,0.4231,1.9251,1.622,1.3324,5.1936,1.7422,2.0982,1.2923,4.478,2.4343,2.0728,0.2385,1.2142,4.6148,3.8651,6.5523,0.8202,4.2229,2.6562,0.8282,6.3442,0.1546,7.8407,0.0039,0.7835,2.1329,3.8641,2.3838,1.2659,0.9164,6.3857,0.9903,1.3149,1.1641,3.731,1.6483,0.5472,5.6061,3.4585,4.5689,2.9508,6.6986,3.5885,4.5974,7.7795,2.775,5.3541,0.0999,2.1006,0.0019,5.6096,4.3978,0.6199,0.2395,8.9518,6.3463,3.3092,1.4958,5.4148,2.6648,2.6061,1.624,3.0366,0.3202,1.1548,5.393,1.4742,5.2655,0.4806,1.2658,0.2192,0.8499,0.0069,1.2053,5.3177,6.6363,4.5064,4.9896,3.0623,6.2323,0.3368,1.1679,0.2963,0.6244,7.3507,0.2168,0.1239,0.6082,2.6018,2.7834,0.329,0.6131,1.7706,5.9958,4.2372,3.1886,4.8905,5.486,3.3678,1.9301,3.6012,0.0313,1.3884,2.8162,1.1579,1.0368,2.0643,5.8599,0.0727,0.6131,8.802,1.7135,5.6979,3.344,0.5302,2.9505,0.1738,0.0056,0.2483,6.2883,3.2958,0.2739,0.0016,0.0028,0.7861,2.4619,6.308,0.0857,1.746,2.1812,0.3409,6.6483,0.5449,3.9333,1.086,3.8741,0.0314,0.103,0.5387,0.3241,1.6666,2.0838,3.8244,4.3338,3.9131,1.8481,3.385,0.0503,2.1077,1.1032,0.9204,0.9354,3.7508,2.4826,5.4546,0.5016,2.7494,0.7632,3.3167,0.1247,3.249,6.8586,0.5983,0.0,1.6506,1.0493,4.6827,1.2158,3.6638,0.0138,2.5339,1.0102,4.1177,6.1386,3.8099,0.8152,6.9718,4.6728,2.3727,0.5697,5.4455,0.6949,10.2859,0.9741,3.7372,2.8064,5.9482,1.5717,2.392,4.7442,1.5322,1.1763,4.8313,0.392,0.7317,6.4123,1.2736,0.2528,1.7306,3.2452,0.0005,0.0779,0.0984,5.4185,1.0685,2.9654,4.0402,0.9862,3.2117,0.9097,0.9879,1.0787,0.6177,4.4593,1.0596,3.2417,3.4505,8.2872,0.4755,2.0002,2.2168,3.7865,3.9917,5.7543,0.0407,3.398,1.5223,5.6771,4.2827,5.3636,1.1266,3.7956,0.365,4.4806,2.1754,0.762,1.4003,3.5584,6.4923,1.1966,2.7116,3.4973,2.8043,1.7332,4.1142,5.0873,1.9244,2.5039,5.5956,4.9968,4.0671,3.4383,2.6565,9.137,0.0013,2.4122,0.8738,0.0234,0.2507,0.742,3.838,1.0703,2.3386,2.1201,0.4443,0.2311,0.9572,4.4063,3.2485,0.2943,0.0183,5.3021,5.9716,4.1898,5.3665,4.0811,5.1119,4.7012,1.5485,0.375,0.0012,1.0402,1.5918,1.3369,4.6122,1.96,2.255,0.0797,5.1694,1.1187,2.2383,3.4927,2.2504,3.5084,3.0335,2.6486,1.2831,3.3939,0.0104,0.345,4.4043,0.0017,0.3975,0.3064,1.7555,2.6805,4.3014,0.0435,2.2963,2.8503,4.7017,3.6646,5.4748,1.6291,2.4588,0.2743,1.6754,5.1162,4.6442,0.5696,2.2574,1.3653,0.697,0.8733,0.3436,0.5567,0.618,0.4563,2.485,0.1656,1.4122,0.3088,0.2683,0.067,0.1137,0.1151,0.0379,0.1332,0.0488,0.0004,0.0239,0.0161,0.0102,0.037,0.0087,0.0217,0.1472]}

Most of the Iowa delegates will choose a preferred candidate to compete in the primaries and then vote for the nominee in the Democratic National Convention in July. But that doesn \u2019 t mean Sanders and his allies say they \u2019 ve given up.\n\u201cThis has been really important for us to develop and refine,\u201d Sanders said in a virtual interview Monday. \u201cThe focus is not on winning back the Senate and the White House in 2018 \u2014 that has been worked out in the past \u2014 and instead it is about putting a strong and winning field together in Iowa and the first contests.\u201d\nSanders has long advocated for a multistage process for selecting a nominating candidate \u2014 something that would involve state primaries for the top Democratic ticket, a national convention later that summer and possibly more primaries around the country in preparation for the nominating contest in November.\nBut the Sanders movement appears to be focusing on the midterms here and locally, with a handful of Iowa delegates deciding who the party will field in the state primaries in April and early May. Sanders plans to announce Iowa candidates soon, but most of the delegates should be on board.\nHis advisers continue to emphasize the importance of building strong networks of grassroots activists and building a support organization that can help bring people into the fold, although he has also said that a national campaign will eventually happen.\nSanders also plans to focus on the potential to win legislative seats in many U.S. states. Some key areas of focus include Democratic senatorial challengers in Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, Democratic challengers for governor in California, Ohio and New York and Democratic state legislators in New Hampshire, Nevada and Virginia.","token_len":414,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.3359,3.3757,0.0019,5.0865,6.0836,0.7932,5.0677,9.0283,4.3232,1.5381,1.4803,4.9642,1.2068,0.53,1.0909,7.1028,0.0074,2.5111,0.5218,15.9202,8.6204,8.8382,7.5641,0.0799,8.8128,0.0018,2.7077,8.6333,0.8783,0.3403,6.5071,0.003,0.0006,0.0297,4.089,0.2987,2.44,6.1519,3.1555,3.874,1.041,2.5602,1.5062,8.0119,7.9154,1.0335,0.8148,0.8321,22.1002,5.5098,1.9823,1.3983,3.6273,5.761,0.0015,2.4403,4.7894,4.2859,3.4903,0.9938,0.8631,0.435,1.7842,2.7937,0.3676,4.9136,0.1462,3.5738,1.449,2.9602,2.9257,1.3051,4.9209,2.7757,3.7271,1.0336,0.9099,7.0889,0.377,0.5945,6.8927,2.0489,1.2419,3.7025,2.3621,6.8346,0.2688,3.2328,5.1293,0.923,0.7918,5.1566,2.5386,5.866,2.0666,0.7298,1.4913,2.4815,1.6569,0.7088,3.3431,1.5339,0.016,1.3816,1.2653,0.2125,5.2361,4.7776,3.6392,5.4071,1.4484,2.4702,1.2765,1.5006,3.9908,0.5314,2.2826,6.7896,0.6784,6.5292,0.066,6.3351,5.6909,0.1837,2.8343,0.6078,10.2222,5.1116,8.1047,4.7037,0.8192,7.1888,2.3748,1.0415,1.593,1.9563,6.4047,3.0121,5.9796,3.9509,7.7242,6.519,4.7234,0.7093,2.0067,0.6813,11.4184,2.4722,1.8472,1.3055,4.4589,1.0587,3.4602,4.4808,1.7266,2.4254,0.9207,3.264,5.8921,0.4934,4.375,2.5431,1.2873,1.5262,0.0009,4.278,2.6505,4.4454,2.197,4.5803,0.7202,7.5068,1.9122,2.58,1.5043,0.5268,1.5501,3.7899,2.0007,5.1265,0.6305,2.574,5.0846,2.691,4.1966,2.9663,5.7925,6.3761,2.1694,2.3951,3.15,1.1799,2.2287,5.5759,4.4628,3.8019,3.3433,3.5142,0.8967,4.0396,2.4836,3.7539,3.0883,0.6052,1.8216,8.273,1.6995,1.939,3.8333,2.243,3.06,2.8944,7.0917,4.3189,4.1926,3.7487,1.037,2.2506,4.5815,5.2538,4.1523,4.9182,2.183,2.9837,4.8915,4.3216,1.3597,2.7739,3.3848,1.0535,7.8718,3.4406,4.1495,1.2869,5.3262,3.9809,4.1623,6.0378,0.0618,0.1631,2.0293,8.9233,0.0646,0.5676,6.1658,3.0166,1.5818,1.4021,0.1795,0.852,1.8556,2.2425,2.315,5.1903,5.197,0.5224,0.5727,4.4466,0.6051,2.3419,6.2746,0.0858,6.8575,2.7581,8.2341,1.1119,2.6433,2.4804,3.4176,0.0247,5.0614,1.9553,4.5002,2.1523,3.7335,1.8643,2.577,4.2929,1.0986,1.1809,3.6809,4.7686,1.7607,3.505,1.817,4.0787,0.1162,0.2724,3.5949,4.3987,0.0869,3.7036,5.9971,5.3489,4.0058,1.4456,2.114,4.8526,0.686,0.8396,1.8702,6.2366,1.5863,3.604,5.9819,3.4261,0.3723,6.3236,6.1357,6.6529,0.0956,3.8024,1.3732,0.3964,0.0224,4.0736,3.7829,3.9119,1.1069,2.9936,1.763,1.6829,4.1513,1.3643,6.9301,5.7708,1.7545,1.3366,2.9797,5.3313,4.271,3.6357,0.3318,1.9012,3.2023,6.1023,2.7265,1.2262,3.5708,1.5345,1.396,3.5975,3.3286,1.8244,2.277,6.6784,4.3736,0.7206,0.3895,2.8986,2.9959,3.4312,0.0584,3.24,0.227,2.6408,5.5465,2.3552,1.9304,7.0033,1.6065,0.6487,5.017,5.9009,0.0007,0.0008,0.0068,0.2481,1.9923,5.1113,5.8295,3.6094,0.7989,1.2634,1.6807,6.2289,5.8968,0.0035,6.7624,1.4756,4.1336,0.5326,2.8291,1.7595,1.0368,1.5896,0.6383,4.3135,6.4288,4.8536,2.89,0.294,2.4713,0.6572,5.8006,0.7688,3.5109,0.3924,1.5423,2.78,2.9372,2.1215,0.5023,2.9036,1.7728,1.4455,4.3335,0.5405,3.0028,0.2747]}

The rules, which passed 232-217, allow passage of the spending bill when it comes up for a vote later this week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland said in a statement.

U.S. Congress A partial government shutdown could also have dire consequences for millions of people whose federal benefits expire on Dec. 15, including health benefits. The new law prohibits anyone in the US from paying for goods and services from any foreign nation with whom the US has a trade war. It also limits the number of visas issued annually to green card applicants. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has been pressing for more than a month for a short-term funding bill to be considered because the Senate needs six more Democrats to fill one Republican seat.\nAnnouncing the ruling, Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was selected by President Donald Trump to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, said in a statement: \u201cIn these challenging times, there are more reasons than ever that our nation must take a page from the Founders.

The Supreme Court is on recess but is expected to address the issue of Barrett\u2019s confirmation shortly after it returns.\nAt the time, the Senate was about to vote on another, perhaps more controversial nomination: that of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. But as Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination drew nearing the finish line and Democrats had a showdown to try and ensure that the Senate would not act out of a sense of partisanship but rather as an apolitical body, the Trump administration made another major impact on the court, the appointment of Barrett.\nBarrett\u2019s appointment was widely seen as aimed at bolstering the court\u2019s liberal flank and creating an additional balance of power for the Senate\u2019s liberal wing. The appointment of a judge who supports abortion rights in cases against the states, and supports tax breaks for the wealthy, and endorses the right of married gay couples seeking equal distribution of assets in their marriage is a powerful and unexpected move for Republicans. It is likely to have an important impact on how Republican-led state and federal elections are conducted in the coming years.\nFor more than a decade, conservative legal activists have been asking for higher courts to be populated in a way that suits conservative policy interests. That objective has been on the forefront of discussions of judicial appointments in both parties, with many conservatives arguing consistently that a conservative judiciary is essential for ensuring that the policies enshrined in the Constitution can be upheld and that court decisions that are not consistent with conservative values will be overturned.","token_len":414,"entropy":[7.0803,2.6284,6.1819,2.678,6.6123,1.3278,6.6865,1.1057,0.024,0.1323,4.766,0.6722,0.0124,2.3738,0.9045,5.9885,0.8074,3.0309,5.4732,1.4035,10.5584,3.0934,2.0391,8.8845,3.394,10.6368,7.8761,3.6164,4.0056,1.531,10.5629,1.9662,6.3724,0.2325,0.8449,6.5656,1.1322,6.6246,0.016,0.5879,2.7626,12.4762,8.9184,6.4727,2.9169,3.2239,2.2604,3.3099,0.7942,2.8247,4.0093,0.5705,0.9525,16.3722,0.882,0.2702,1.5066,2.6907,2.9323,5.5355,4.5466,8.4594,4.0028,0.4198,5.3746,3.6733,1.6654,4.0095,0.0028,0.0063,0.0043,1.0024,1.8755,0.0813,6.1245,3.3345,4.0789,0.0035,3.9222,1.4455,2.1953,0.0003,0.0023,0.0027,0.3687,0.0021,0.0017,0.023,0.0017,3.8,0.0005,1.3732,2.0521,3.9832,3.3897,5.9422,2.7828,4.9655,2.9305,1.8886,2.5322,5.8996,7.7214,0.6936,3.7877,5.0664,0.1688,0.746,2.8645,4.3337,0.0016,1.7829,4.8198,3.9703,5.1229,2.3796,0.8107,0.0328,5.1115,0.9482,1.841,2.4411,13.7516,9.4699,0.3227,3.9932,3.3663,5.0376,2.307,4.7724,3.6195,2.3509,0.5336,4.9878,1.0714,3.0485,0.3678,2.3958,2.508,2.2397,5.618,0.2617,1.6184,0.2843,4.7712,5.2977,4.49,1.5058,2.0979,2.6886,1.9557,6.2052,0.0954,2.399,4.2485,0.0608,2.4509,0.0472,2.5753,0.0016,0.5303,3.4426,3.5572,6.693,10.1146,0.045,0.0143,1.2268,4.4905,10.8427,3.2985,3.7738,0.0043,3.5315,4.1651,3.6042,3.5686,7.5924,3.2226,4.4089,2.2556,5.7249,1.5679,1.5631,2.6505,1.7568,1.4416,4.7409,7.9358,0.6572,2.6999,2.8017,0.1731,4.676,0.0001,7.6328,0.932,4.0418,2.0272,8.1887,0.4171,3.0573,0.8976,1.6228,4.3349,0.4246,4.1964,5.1537,3.854,8.0064,1.7004,0.3835,2.1282,2.667,4.4961,1.9746,0.039,3.5691,1.5654,0.545,2.8256,0.0048,2.5458,0.0074,0.1285,1.4175,1.8847,4.4539,1.4719,0.155,7.7619,0.2032,3.6175,0.0011,1.0305,3.6615,5.627,0.0133,0.0214,3.059,4.8386,1.932,4.827,2.1629,5.3772,6.4444,0.9065,0.0797,2.6357,1.1125,3.9923,4.78,0.0309,0.0252,3.7811,1.7884,0.4577,2.5103,2.0261,1.1916,3.507,2.1883,1.3863,5.3623,2.5731,0.1584,3.9373,1.3051,5.8761,0.821,4.0137,2.5468,2.5308,4.5781,8.8244,2.2655,0.1522,1.5052,0.3461,0.3185,4.5325,9.6488,0.0551,2.1551,3.7311,1.616,7.0243,5.817,0.3445,7.2083,7.1136,9.8013,0.062,3.1575,2.1956,2.0764,2.7302,2.9926,1.6143,3.4564,3.9319,6.6329,2.306,2.0467,3.3047,1.1995,2.9626,1.838,4.1067,0.9605,2.5742,2.6544,2.7429,0.7532,0.206,2.3487,5.3332,2.5537,1.9827,4.3378,3.8188,1.038,5.0632,0.926,1.6083,2.0487,1.2813,1.5129,2.0597,0.6359,0.4259,4.5133,3.7734,1.8446,0.5392,0.764,0.1719,2.9907,4.2517,3.8592,0.46,1.2092,5.5918,1.993,7.6031,2.9756,0.8668,3.3298,6.93,5.4994,2.1693,1.0525,0.0997,5.9549,2.5634,5.0536,1.9475,0.7258,3.7805,7.0317,0.7592,0.9233,5.79,0.6491,4.0414,0.1181,6.4769,3.1979,2.834,1.5269,1.9565,4.2647,1.2638,1.5658,2.4662,3.2187,2.8105,3.1971,10.0059,0.0874,2.7519,2.3954,3.1254,1.5697,4.3805,1.636,3.7215,1.2745,1.2483,6.6096,5.7506,0.0011,0.1147,0.2579,0.2374,4.0027,0.4045,2.049,2.0628,1.7379,6.4415,1.8968,2.4521,2.2503,2.3841,2.6602,0.0362,2.0834,1.6588,3.0679,0.83,2.039,0.3855]}

Our position is","text":"Britain should leave open the option remaining in the single market and customs union after a Brexit transition period, the Brexit spokesman for the opposition Labour Party said on Wednesday. Our position is very clear: we want to negotiate about all outstanding issues, but our negotiating terms are: the rights of UK citizens who live and work here, access to goods and services and to the single market.\" \"At a time of unprecedented uncertainty from the point of view of trade policy, we would be foolish not to use the single market as a basis for negotiations about trade and tariffs\", said Jeremy Corbyn. He argued that Britain has had \"strategic advantage\" in its trade relations with the EU in so far as it has had the freedom to make its own deals outside the EU. \"There is widespread consensus in the UK that trading on the basis of a single market is more efficient than doing business with Brussels,\" said Corbyn. In his first TV interview since the Brexit referendum, he also said the UK would have been better off without \"political leaders playing politics,\" referring to the ongoing row between British Prime Minister. \"But it's not the end of the world,\" Corbyn said about the Brexit decision. \"We will have to adapt and evolve and find new ways of working in our bilateral trade with the EU.\" \"I know that many people have asked me why I didn't speak out before now about this decision,\" he continued. \"What I've observed today is a lack of clarity on some of the issues the EU wants to negotiate and how we can continue to do business, for example where we control our passport, border control regimes, mutual recognition.\"\nA woman and a baby were found dead inside their home Tuesday night, May 4, in Chilliwack, B.C.

Erdogan said the talks would include both leaders and their foreign ministers, with a possible trip to Washington.\nThe head of Turkey s largest opposition group, which is a moderate in a party that often speaks out critical of Erdogan, met with Macron to discuss the crisis Wednesday night, Turkish media reported. Erdogan has urged Trump not to return diplomatic recognition to Israel, which Ankara considers the illegitimate result of the 1967 Israeli War and the de facto recognition of the 1949 Treaty of Peace with Egypt. The deal also established the Jordanian and Palestinian territories of the West Bank as a permanent state of Israel.\nThe new deal, signed in Washington just days before Trump s departure for his campaign tour to the Asia-Pacific region, will go into effect as early as Wednesday, with the Trump administration set to announce it, said Erdogan s chief of staff, on the condition of anonymity. Israel s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday called Trump a betrayer and mocked his promise to deliver on the status of Jerusalem, adding on his radio program he knew the plan was just that, a plan. Netanyahu said he hoped Trump would reconsider. The White House said Trump would make a decision early Thursday.\nThe latest in a series of meetings for Macron, whom Erdogan dubbed the most important leader in the Middle East, comes as the European Union has been increasingly calling on the U.S. to reconsider its status announcement.

{"prompt":"Japan has detected radio signals suggesting North Korea may be preparing another ballistic missile launch , although such signals are not unusual and satellite images did not show fresh activity , a Japanese government source","text":"Japan has detected radio signals suggesting North Korea may be preparing another ballistic missile launch, although such signals are not unusual and satellite images did not show fresh activity, a Japanese government source and a North Korea watchdog said on Monday. The latest signals were detected by a Japanese-operated satellite, said the source and the Korea Institute for National Unification, an independent think tank. A North Korea-related website posted images of a mysterious red-and-white object seen Monday night, and later posted the signals on its own website. But the photos were later taken down, said the source. That website said the source had an internal source who confirmed the North was developing a rocket or missile. Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Ministry said later it had spoken to foreign counterparts and was awaiting confirmation of its signals and images. It doesn\u2019t seem to represent new activity, it said. However, the North Korea website\u2019s claim that it had access to a \u201csenior official\u2019s\u201d source is not confirmed. The source was not speaking on its official behalf and no one within the ministry was able to confirm the pictures, either, the ministry said. A person who was involved in the process confirmed the North was likely to launch a launch vehicle at some point over the next two weeks, but did not confirm the images, the ministry said. The Japan Agency for Cultural Affairs released an early version of a report in which the satellite detected two objects in northern Japan. One was a satellite, the other was a rocket, it said. The images were captured by a Japanese space observation system called \u201cInSight\u201d. The agency said it is studying the two images in its own report. A North Korea watchdog said it had received information that some military sites in North Korea, near the Sea of Japan, had been scrubbed. The North Korea Central News Agency, known for its lack of accuracy and its repeated news reports, did not mention scrubbing but provided a video of a rocket launch site. The images were reported earlier by the BBC.","token_len":415,"entropy":[5.2527,9.2285,6.7239,1.7241,5.4058,5.952,0.2348,2.0116,1.0327,2.012,5.9294,4.6794,0.092,1.5467,1.7957,4.7786,4.9103,2.9652,1.2113,1.7227,4.3319,3.8728,8.2986,1.9111,5.3355,0.015,1.2124,9.5188,2.6389,3.5896,2.99,4.2494,2.291,2.0843,7.2026,1.5786,3.4611,1.5311,7.2923,0.949,1.3136,2.0746,0.0723,3.0984,4.4818,2.5786,2.4549,2.9517,1.5867,1.8263,3.0539,3.8802,2.5502,0.9554,1.6236,4.1193,0.6015,0.4555,3.5618,2.0989,6.0004,4.2794,0.7106,3.1249,4.4101,0.0065,1.4607,2.7251,1.3102,2.1065,0.0918,0.6575,3.7884,1.7651,1.4529,2.8514,2.7943,5.5909,4.5952,2.3342,0.6199,1.7688,7.0413,3.8917,2.3594,1.7014,0.0022,0.8948,3.2306,3.4976,7.1141,2.9908,2.0734,2.7294,5.0141,3.2242,2.8441,5.0374,2.2074,0.8683,2.7379,0.6876,0.4797,4.9863,1.0987,7.8121,1.317,5.3405,2.5477,2.5161,1.4531,3.8341,0.2266,0.2411,0.7969,5.6599,5.3651,1.4525,0.8341,5.1468,1.9894,5.3113,5.9644,4.9205,3.3113,3.7334,0.6768,2.0753,2.92,3.5869,0.6426,3.3482,3.8652,2.038,1.1301,4.3232,16.1112,9.2783,4.7688,6.8535,0.1486,0.0579,3.7274,0.8582,6.8997,2.1884,1.3231,6.059,0.5908,6.8391,4.8965,2.255,2.9507,4.2056,3.2412,1.1681,3.0567,4.8056,3.66,5.8298,0.4557,2.8275,7.306,6.2596,2.0202,0.0092,5.1269,1.0127,7.6882,5.1876,0.524,1.1644,2.2442,0.1222,0.487,4.251,0.0193,1.3452,1.8964,2.5765,4.814,10.4976,0.1004,0.1258,5.6762,1.3415,1.7403,3.5587,7.7327,0.022,1.9715,15.7177,4.0269,9.4953,0.1063,1.876,0.28,1.0573,1.5345,6.8179,6.1552,3.7636,7.8737,2.3895,3.7476,0.8797,1.6383,1.8851,3.1015,1.3489,7.1152,0.9953,9.2793,2.521,5.796,2.3997,5.0003,2.8146,5.075,0.686,1.238,1.8717,2.6699,0.006,1.6203,1.1295,7.7573,2.4983,5.7221,2.0568,0.8158,3.0394,0.3447,0.2649,3.0728,5.644,2.5687,2.4287,2.8876,0.1392,0.6622,4.2493,5.9201,1.2011,1.081,2.1509,4.9188,1.4215,0.952,0.5952,4.5705,4.15,4.1255,2.9784,0.1322,3.9277,0.2415,0.7446,2.7995,1.037,0.9,2.5902,2.7355,0.0131,3.2024,1.6723,2.8699,2.3615,0.7332,0.9695,0.2998,0.1358,1.2951,4.9941,6.5122,0.032,8.3609,0.1504,5.7866,3.2259,5.3061,1.5054,0.0271,1.4343,1.9505,3.1683,2.8009,2.5554,6.3077,3.6684,3.7356,3.6464,2.1961,4.8605,0.9505,1.59,3.2171,1.334,1.2404,3.4705,1.9003,1.3537,1.8032,1.0689,0.4463,3.85,1.492,1.9919,0.0569,0.1711,0.8615,3.929,1.2917,5.1468,0.9442,0.829,2.2129,4.9709,5.3018,3.6604,4.5006,9.3317,0.8236,7.0424,5.5447,0.7072,0.3549,5.2219,1.4726,0.7501,3.6474,0.647,1.333,3.5513,4.587,0.5207,4.8492,2.2585,3.5586,3.5906,2.0916,5.2996,0.8638,3.0,1.1442,0.7741,5.1031,1.1214,2.1289,1.577,1.9476,3.3235,1.8197,4.7512,6.0479,3.5019,0.8375,2.6324,0.0279,3.7436,6.1231,0.4295,5.6931,0.0019,0.0127,0.3301,2.2215,1.218,9.5095,0.0299,3.0058,1.125,1.8999,2.0227,5.8688,0.1386,0.0361,2.6307,5.736,3.8579,0.4864,7.3575,0.002,3.8223,3.2154,3.3987,4.8088,5.5034,2.1051,0.8734,4.0936,0.0417,3.4786,10.8767,0.0724,4.4895,4.6234,1.6543,3.7242,1.6731,1.22,4.2784,2.1969,5.239,2.0692,1.0189,5.6214,1.0027,4.5103,4.4776,1.6126,1.0101,6.4742,1.1103]}

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump has concluded interviews with the five candidates he is considering to chair the Federal Reserve and could announce a decision as early as next week , a source familiar with the process","text":"President Donald Trump has concluded interviews with the five candidates he is considering to chair the Federal Reserve and could announce a decision as early as next week, a source familiar with the process told Reuters on Wednesday night.\nThe source added the President is weighing how far to go with his interview process, given the need to maintain a public appearance on the Fed's board and the political backlash that could follow.\nTrump's choice would have a powerful moment in his presidency - potentially leading to a change of the Fed's monetary-policy direction - if he names Jerome Powell and his term is subsequently confirmed by Congress.\nAn announcement before then could have negative consequences for the Republican Party ahead of the mid-term elections, the source added.\nEarlier, Trump's Chief of Staff said the current chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, was being investigated for fraud by Justice Department investigators.\nBernanke, who has been in the Fed since 1999, was under intense scrutiny while under investigation. He and his wife sold two second-home properties during the probe but the price fell far short of their initial expectations because of the investigations.\nBut the President and his advisers have also long opposed a change to the Fed's interest-rate setting based on any form of quantitative easing rather than the historically low benchmark rate of federal funds.\nBernanke's term runs through 2018 at the Fed, having served under presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and now, Trump. It is also being challenged in his home state of Minnesota.\nThe Fed does not make public the reasons behind any change to its monetary policy. That authority and its independence are guarded with a high degree of precence, and only granted to the Fed by Congress.\nTrump has already tapped a nominee for vice chair, and a new Fed chair for about two weeks to replace Larry Summers. Summers, whose tenure as Fed chairman was up next year, said he would not seek re-appointment this year.\nThe next board meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee is set for Oct 17 to Oct19 under this term.","token_len":416,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,2.8326,7.9904,10.4173,0.3774,2.9237,4.9179,3.2694,2.3799,2.6712,0.7533,2.5034,5.9977,0.1314,2.8498,0.9664,2.8667,5.705,2.1779,2.4203,3.0594,2.7466,0.3272,0.0025,0.8041,0.3703,1.7944,2.697,2.063,1.348,0.0013,0.1964,1.7931,0.4408,2.7258,1.3211,2.0235,4.6757,0.0662,0.2303,15.1883,2.8136,2.33,3.0046,6.2272,2.503,4.2504,4.6527,3.8299,1.4384,1.5288,2.4018,1.5757,5.6935,4.2606,1.258,3.5888,1.2337,5.2619,0.6996,4.8272,1.7444,5.1428,5.0822,3.3429,1.0262,5.7371,0.637,3.1654,1.8253,1.5169,4.7981,6.3052,2.2018,1.5198,2.1386,1.1919,0.0992,15.2154,1.5708,4.5647,4.3267,3.3701,2.5299,4.4621,7.3735,1.2475,2.7747,3.4655,4.9531,5.8515,3.1422,0.3266,1.1445,4.2322,1.447,2.8105,2.7742,0.5098,4.0968,8.2545,0.0515,4.753,2.6975,3.2282,1.1155,9.6232,7.1315,0.0144,2.9665,5.1964,7.368,2.7621,10.0449,4.255,1.8862,1.5284,0.3726,0.2947,8.5432,2.5808,5.9779,3.8075,1.2043,3.3086,6.0302,1.6882,0.4324,0.7019,4.7504,0.9823,6.1834,0.0156,0.8553,3.7582,1.0556,0.2876,0.2386,2.0322,3.4965,0.2496,2.6979,0.1102,0.1233,6.6485,1.9757,1.6814,1.8504,7.0176,1.0105,0.0037,6.0892,1.9876,5.9935,3.5212,1.23,0.0432,1.2757,1.7774,1.7061,0.0812,0.0,0.0462,1.5447,4.2671,2.7802,1.1253,4.9129,2.5261,7.7081,0.0282,1.7458,0.8285,0.3292,6.237,0.0002,2.0264,0.8973,1.7743,1.1338,2.3062,1.113,1.2776,0.6504,3.2363,0.1665,1.6497,5.1281,3.3258,0.3686,6.3108,5.3374,1.413,4.7923,2.0735,5.2323,1.228,1.1749,7.6802,6.4646,7.8306,1.7271,7.3963,2.834,4.3634,0.8769,6.8532,4.0282,3.2851,6.4813,2.2944,6.2772,1.4212,0.0342,3.4629,3.6444,2.4276,4.3389,0.5028,1.2925,7.7657,0.3659,0.1511,4.168,1.5887,4.5708,3.4826,0.6767,2.8535,0.8979,3.9805,6.9654,6.0668,2.7143,3.0094,1.9459,0.2696,1.1179,0.1224,5.4644,2.1432,0.0035,5.3572,6.4633,0.0281,7.0697,7.5503,0.0028,2.9974,0.0018,6.4067,0.006,2.0353,6.9475,2.0363,5.0971,0.9262,1.5577,7.5404,0.4806,4.8451,0.2452,4.596,0.0003,1.7477,2.7573,4.2708,1.1265,2.7649,5.0846,0.4322,5.1839,2.6192,6.506,5.2285,3.0395,4.2314,1.8704,0.159,0.1588,0.0007,1.6305,2.3773,0.0023,0.3483,7.3698,5.2503,2.2524,0.4184,5.046,1.2547,2.9638,3.8519,4.7293,2.4498,5.3111,3.5272,0.1122,0.2794,3.684,1.1136,0.3081,1.7797,2.0004,4.9176,0.2461,4.6356,3.9073,2.7266,4.9222,1.8706,4.2347,3.0724,1.4645,1.0226,2.8338,0.2352,0.9062,5.7032,7.4714,6.0212,2.4334,4.8262,1.931,7.9268,5.0764,1.8102,4.0054,0.7793,0.0014,12.6351,9.5161,1.6187,2.402,5.8454,8.9837,2.0244,1.903,2.5977,1.9652,0.8124,0.9574,0.3344,2.693,1.261,4.0045,5.0466,2.8116,6.0151,1.3396,4.6841,1.7456,1.2275,3.3071,2.8648,3.6834,3.0786,1.7131,6.0079,8.8628,1.7988,1.7173,3.1903,3.4771,5.7632,0.1256,1.3025,5.9803,1.1961,4.3662,1.4357,2.5406,3.1633,0.461,1.3251,5.5199,6.5589,0.5107,0.1319,5.0103,1.5035,1.4404,1.7707,2.2237,2.1628,0.0441,7.8464,0.2164,5.5542,0.971,0.5017,0.3263,2.0344,4.8805,6.0985,3.5701,2.0853,0.1383,1.0171,1.1622,0.0144,0.0135,1.8439,2.0511,0.1068,3.5713,8.3524,4.8978,9.7949,7.8448,7.7071,6.8465,5.8242,0.9037]}

so that both parties can launch official negotiations on a fresh coalition.\nMerkel said that while the two parties have had to work hard to make progress, they have not reached fundamental disagreements.\n\u201cWe have still a long way to go but I think we are making good progress,\u201d she said in Berlin, where she hosted a press conference at the headquarters of the Chancellery.\nHer comments were reported in detail in the German daily Bild am Sonntag, citing unnamed sources.\nBoth Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz, chairman of the Social Democrats, have so far kept their distances from their competitors in the polls with an alliance announced in January by the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and the centrist Free Democrat Party (FDP).\nMerkel\u2019s spokesman Steffen Seibert said there had been \u201csome important agreements\u201d reached over the past two weeks.\nOn the economy, Merkel said she backed \u201cthe continuation of the austerity program\u201d insofar as it was necessary to generate sufficient revenue to ensure the stability of the public finances and not to endanger the economy.\nBut she added: \u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to have an unnecessarily huge and uncontrolled deficit.\u201d\nThe current government, whose last budget deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP was set by Merkel in 2015, sets a target for the economy to grow by 2.1 percent next year.\nHer Social Democrat colleagues warn against too much austerity during the next crisis because their coalition partner, the FDP, already warned that their support for austerity measures could be weakened during elections.\nMeanwhile, the German economy is expected to grow at a 0.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter of this year, according to forecasts released on Sunday by the Institute for Business Research.\nThe estimate of growth at the end of February would be the slowest of the course of the current year.","token_len":417,"entropy":[9.8851,1.7617,0.0003,2.9044,1.5913,1.9701,2.1883,3.7515,1.9392,6.0654,12.0411,0.0157,0.1026,0.7624,1.6856,8.7321,0.2022,2.4459,12.6226,0.4335,2.1807,3.9945,0.1921,0.9098,3.7662,3.2374,0.0407,3.6609,7.2942,0.7778,4.6588,0.7972,0.4771,6.3725,7.0406,1.1351,1.5785,1.5065,6.0917,2.7715,1.5182,0.395,18.2586,0.0005,1.9737,2.5584,2.8484,1.6572,3.0832,0.533,2.7608,3.6177,3.022,1.7765,1.9464,0.6199,4.1653,1.53,1.2438,1.7732,2.6958,3.2988,3.066,8.7246,6.1259,1.035,0.3276,11.302,7.8603,8.3979,1.7381,5.88,3.4277,0.7147,0.0569,0.0134,0.0315,3.5718,2.6134,1.5866,0.979,1.7398,4.2757,3.7404,0.0145,3.0613,8.8559,8.5865,1.2465,0.6969,1.778,2.0157,2.0783,2.6984,0.4333,5.1144,1.1656,3.1343,0.0119,3.2958,0.4951,4.9537,0.0224,0.4296,3.767,0.0039,0.0009,1.0473,0.2571,4.5605,0.956,2.5139,4.5375,2.2251,7.3868,1.6287,1.3587,1.1232,1.4148,1.1905,4.6346,0.0012,0.0,0.007,1.5738,4.1491,2.5049,0.5655,0.8674,0.3118,6.054,5.7979,0.1004,0.4003,3.5129,0.0115,0.0002,1.3711,6.658,0.0184,0.1359,2.5746,0.1638,0.7623,1.1173,5.7749,0.0002,4.2968,1.3476,8.6421,0.2554,3.4832,8.8966,1.5084,0.3921,3.937,5.4293,5.0778,4.7299,7.0737,1.5108,3.5413,4.552,1.1646,2.9606,0.0213,0.6445,2.2823,1.3581,0.99,1.1486,0.0003,1.3216,1.0351,0.6083,4.9749,2.5841,5.4159,0.274,0.0621,0.1568,0.0005,0.4007,0.3038,2.0173,0.0004,12.6256,7.1904,1.5196,3.9283,2.0774,0.0022,0.001,0.0009,0.0056,1.0206,5.0281,2.0531,0.1244,16.123,0.8626,4.5537,7.7861,6.5123,6.3881,2.9118,3.7166,4.2748,0.2058,0.7168,2.5032,0.8646,1.6537,0.4677,4.7561,3.3415,3.994,0.2268,1.5325,1.0439,2.4238,7.954,10.2006,0.0562,1.518,6.0181,0.0716,1.0986,4.9546,1.8674,1.3977,0.5316,11.2226,0.0152,0.4007,1.7412,1.6224,0.6376,6.6994,4.0875,1.9645,0.861,4.8801,1.7676,4.3664,0.1018,0.3852,5.3126,0.2729,2.1651,4.7605,1.1532,5.3119,0.7503,3.4319,0.9949,0.1928,3.9439,0.9031,2.045,2.2047,3.0012,0.1023,2.3241,3.6808,2.9134,2.2699,0.0424,4.9487,2.3817,6.5816,6.2035,3.644,5.2969,2.0784,1.608,3.5936,1.3597,0.3643,2.5856,5.4381,3.1273,2.6696,4.5781,5.3558,3.6263,5.3159,2.0483,3.2033,0.0931,2.6101,1.1141,0.254,0.6565,0.9735,4.1853,2.8621,3.2569,1.0219,4.0682,0.1876,9.0727,1.3134,0.4775,2.3817,2.04,3.6546,0.5507,0.7614,1.1009,1.5867,0.3864,2.581,0.0159,2.6603,0.0585,0.8804,0.4623,4.8817,6.2275,2.723,3.4652,9.1561,4.8673,5.9993,0.7716,1.2016,5.4554,0.823,2.1855,5.4392,3.7222,5.304,5.1295,2.6603,0.7604,0.2954,4.3319,0.0026,0.1361,5.2457,8.6192,1.2635,4.8998,4.9502,0.7142,3.0161,3.4318,1.0624,2.3353,3.5572,4.5283,5.2354,1.3493,0.2324,5.1118,0.0903,1.2931,2.9013,3.3425,1.2846,2.2568,0.0062,1.1759,1.2235,1.1187,2.9182,0.0009,2.206,0.0234,0.4238,0.7373,0.8009,1.096,1.2273,0.6386,0.465,1.3376,0.0111,0.6924,1.8987,0.0033,4.6148,3.3963,1.7236,2.355,0.7658,0.9408,5.2499,0.323,4.4322,1.667,0.7997,0.5188,1.7973,6.7953,2.9797,1.5323,3.7187,1.1685,1.1992,0.0029,5.1883,4.4439,0.4997,2.3057,4.9538,0.0001,3.6697,1.0466,10.4081,1.1163,0.5941,1.7663,1.998,1.2372]}
{"prompt":"Imprisoned former vice-president of Catalonia Oriol Junqueras and three other jailed members of his ERC party will abide by a ruling giving Madrid control over the region , their defense lawyer said on Tuesday .","text":"Imprisoned former vice-president of Catalonia Oriol Junqueras and three other jailed members of his ERC party will abide by a ruling giving Madrid control over the region, their defense lawyer said on Tuesday. They would be allowed to take part in political activities and represent ERC through a representative committee.\nThe ruling by the Spanish Supreme Court and Constitutional Court, though they will not be allowed to leave the state until there is a final judgment.\nIt is the first time since Spain's unification in the 19th century that elected members of a political party in Catalonia were put on standby by the Spanish government. It is understood Junqueras and the other jailed members will still be allowed to vote and run for election under the terms of their arrest warrant.\nJunqueras was sentenced to 13 years in July by the Spanish Supreme Court after he helped organise independence talks that were then aborted by Madrid's government.\nJunqueras, a former minister, is the former vice-president of Catalonia and leader of ERC, a secessionist party. He was convicted of crimes related to the secessionist movement of Catalonia, even as he was in office, by a court in Barcelona on July 27. However, the court's ruling does not prevent other politicians and public figures from taking part in activities within the Catalan political system and they will vote until the Supreme Court's verdict stands.\nThe Spanish judges ruled against the Catalonia government, which held separatist talks that were not allowed by Madrid, in mid-July 2017. The separatists had promised a referendum on whether Catalonia wanted to become an independent state. The Catalan government had threatened not to hold the vote if the Madrid government refused to let it take place.\nIn February, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont had accused the Spanish government of wanting to create an \"illegal situation of de facto independence in Catalonia, under the guise of legality and constitutionality\". The country currently has a Constitutional Court that is supposed to ensure Spanish legality but the ruling on the question of Catalonia suggests the judges will not be able to maintain their position.","token_len":417,"entropy":[10.0984,1.1269,9.5757,6.1558,1.4733,0.1028,2.0651,7.1188,9.2796,0.0089,0.0041,0.0015,0.0011,3.1224,5.9853,1.1126,6.0754,2.9619,0.1043,1.2337,8.152,1.7755,1.4129,5.5133,10.3341,0.039,2.4483,4.4579,8.4671,7.4169,3.7563,0.8468,0.9898,2.2571,2.3829,6.1858,7.7777,2.5443,0.4335,1.0895,1.7979,0.1479,7.5094,3.0227,1.1218,2.2686,0.1145,4.1627,1.203,0.0313,3.8902,2.1308,2.2292,6.9464,5.5423,0.0175,6.9605,1.7743,5.291,3.0849,1.0772,0.4418,13.6828,2.4242,3.728,0.7173,4.4053,2.6854,0.0313,4.1952,6.1717,0.0441,2.7381,5.8035,6.2275,3.5285,1.1679,1.1448,2.6328,0.0624,5.6778,1.044,3.8794,2.8676,5.1084,0.4251,0.6972,3.3896,4.2065,4.217,0.5878,5.2586,1.545,1.4728,0.7609,0.4248,3.423,3.6422,0.6911,6.9883,0.9185,3.5785,4.6293,0.0061,0.026,0.0848,5.452,4.6673,0.1918,1.7572,1.3246,0.1713,3.648,2.5058,3.2339,4.8961,0.8278,8.9139,3.0363,0.8522,3.2302,1.0863,0.9828,4.448,1.4008,5.5063,6.575,0.0159,0.0081,1.7868,2.5425,1.0685,2.6128,0.9104,1.5919,4.2966,0.6783,1.3615,0.0678,3.6732,2.6787,4.4456,0.7194,3.72,5.4877,0.998,3.6379,0.0584,2.424,4.2539,2.1486,0.3386,0.2273,2.0274,0.02,0.0033,2.2804,3.4081,0.3233,4.8343,0.2849,0.4137,8.8205,3.3377,0.6701,1.9391,1.3733,0.0053,2.3927,1.2426,5.3047,3.4422,6.4418,3.7404,3.4032,2.3361,6.5043,4.3137,1.5977,1.4718,3.4616,2.9347,0.3676,0.7308,3.2954,0.0235,0.0042,1.9138,2.1529,1.0286,3.8005,3.005,2.5477,2.7011,4.2485,3.0225,0.2188,0.0327,0.1359,1.4363,1.9285,5.0111,0.0128,2.3221,0.0049,1.3976,1.5049,5.7746,0.0311,0.9767,1.2632,1.6368,1.3099,3.0404,0.8718,4.0364,3.6894,0.0034,1.5603,3.7414,1.6658,0.8343,3.5337,1.4611,2.233,6.7779,2.6578,1.0153,0.8548,2.5646,3.0609,1.8494,5.8984,1.4059,1.8972,1.1596,2.3269,2.0911,2.4105,3.6507,0.4601,6.1442,0.0679,1.745,1.5391,4.2392,1.2758,3.4908,0.0135,2.9794,5.8166,2.5351,2.6212,4.9401,0.1697,0.2712,2.4258,0.1223,0.2228,5.7458,4.9238,0.8033,2.6493,3.234,1.2043,3.7492,3.6399,1.2018,8.2746,6.4128,1.6693,4.787,0.0043,3.653,2.9406,7.0172,0.2383,0.19,1.4968,3.3565,6.1447,2.7585,2.8955,1.5653,8.2398,1.9125,2.7013,2.0194,5.017,8.3064,3.1678,3.2621,1.1567,4.5369,3.5538,1.5077,0.8897,1.8361,2.5893,6.4986,0.0167,0.7969,7.5432,0.5045,1.9192,6.8038,2.9516,3.4054,3.0153,0.964,1.0973,4.5374,3.3701,6.8434,0.794,2.9081,2.5538,0.1584,0.5108,0.888,2.1455,2.5036,0.3649,2.365,4.3951,5.8222,0.0193,2.2314,1.7617,2.7076,2.4973,1.2286,5.8448,1.2258,2.465,0.6594,3.9273,1.5785,2.0809,0.0055,0.2469,0.4292,3.0004,4.0087,0.4856,4.0956,1.951,0.1336,0.0006,0.0006,0.0002,0.0,0.0,4.0168,4.359,0.9387,1.467,0.3331,0.0657,4.7314,0.2626,3.8173,2.0813,0.8492,2.8837,5.2331,3.4602,5.8676,0.2447,1.3176,3.4526,0.8294,3.0632,4.5694,1.0195,1.6465,0.0323,8.3082,2.1946,7.0475,0.2158,1.8558,2.0932,5.19,6.5873,0.572,2.2766,5.3274,0.0574,1.9856,1.61,3.4277,0.0015,5.0698,5.8062,5.8436,3.1889,2.0249,2.1949,3.8504,1.5582,3.8907,1.7553,4.4619,9.3804,1.7118,3.9656,2.9034,1.4443,1.3581,0.4947,0.0206,7.1148,1.3517,3.8353,0.8473]}

Protesters were displeased with the decision.\nPence was due to visit the US Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem on September 23. He was expected to meet Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas.\nIn a statement on Sunday, a White House official said that since Trump left office the White House has sought to engage with Palestinians to bring the Middle East peace process back on track, despite no progress made on issues like Palestinian statehood, West Bank annexation, Jerusalem and economic development.\n\u201cWe believe it is important for our new administration to engage Palestinians in meaningful ways to bring the Middle East peace process back on track.

{"prompt":"An earlier version of a healthcare bill Republican leaders are trying to push through the U.S. Senate would save at least $ 133 billion over 10 years , Congress \u2019 nonpartisan budget agency said on","text":"An earlier version of a healthcare bill Republican leaders are trying to push through the U.S. Senate would save at least $ 133 billion over 10 years, Congress \u2019 nonpartisan budget agency said on Thursday.\nIt would be a $ 18 billion bump on President Barack Obama \u2019 s Medicare prescription drug program. The original proposal, put forward last year and expected to be debated this June as part of a broader health overhaul, would save an additional $ 31 billion over the same time period.\n\u201c Medicare spending per beneficiary is growing at a faster rate than the average of all states of the American Association of Retired Persons, \u201c said Tom Maloney, deputy director of the Congressional Budget Office, citing medical conditions such as heart disease and cancer, which require more health care services than people in their 70s and 80s.\n\u201cThe proposal that I just submitted to you today is based on strong research and rigorous analysis that was funded by the states themselves and by the American Association of Retired Persons. \u201c\u201d The Senate budget commission, comprised of members of both parties, also recommended that Congress adopt a version of Obama\u2019s health care plan.\nAn earlier version of the bill would have eliminated the deductibles and coinsurance that many Americans pay for prescription drugs at the time of buying them. The proposal would have also created a national health exchange that would enable people to get more affordable care. Instead, the new compromise bill calls for the use of national drug plans, which Obama has proposed for similar reasons.\nUnder the proposed legislation, the government would not force people to join drug plans, and the exchanges would be run by private insurance companies. The legislation would also not include Obama \u2019 s health insurance program expansion to lower- and middle-income Americans, which would make at least 25 million more eligible.\nUnder the current health care proposals, health plans offered by smaller companies such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield and Aetna would also be included in the exchanges, but Medicare beneficiaries would be allowed to opt-out of the plans.","token_len":417,"entropy":[8.3444,0.7525,0.0633,7.1999,11.8173,2.165,9.8646,0.7881,3.1615,2.7135,0.0071,3.3433,0.7505,1.8306,4.3778,0.002,0.0066,0.0019,0.9031,2.0072,8.2351,5.4093,0.0044,0.2079,16.5604,0.3882,0.4645,0.9484,0.0019,1.4278,8.4817,14.49,9.409,9.8277,3.6351,4.9674,3.5398,1.8233,1.4146,0.2495,0.3407,16.5586,1.7975,3.3887,2.0693,2.6635,8.8738,0.3818,5.0811,3.0934,5.0242,0.5249,0.0016,5.8633,0.0891,9.5897,4.1143,4.3008,0.5081,2.3175,1.8408,2.6397,5.8689,3.3479,2.0234,5.036,0.4953,3.3762,0.8338,4.1167,4.8325,0.0458,1.1608,3.4184,2.3763,6.9785,5.5094,0.6674,0.0004,1.1249,3.1834,2.1706,2.3862,0.7873,1.5438,1.2541,4.9092,1.8885,0.0229,6.4517,0.0674,0.4831,1.7931,2.8673,1.3143,0.2905,0.4665,0.2293,7.623,5.5741,7.6768,3.2915,6.1289,1.1011,2.6032,5.2499,1.0802,0.8599,1.76,0.5685,0.2103,1.8186,4.2147,2.3043,1.7174,3.8449,5.6444,1.0208,5.6799,6.8629,0.1974,3.4118,0.015,0.0434,1.6433,7.8947,1.8501,3.3504,4.6669,7.2049,2.0947,0.1762,3.7752,0.6051,0.332,0.5686,2.2486,0.0398,0.0003,2.1835,4.1763,7.9902,5.9144,1.6559,0.0013,1.9133,0.3001,1.0055,1.3971,2.3955,2.6025,5.1153,1.842,4.0478,0.2909,3.1438,1.6747,3.5476,1.3401,2.8865,2.9499,0.0055,0.8175,0.7289,0.0005,0.4567,0.2697,1.8215,0.2343,4.5213,4.8303,5.1385,7.9776,4.875,5.1527,0.8571,2.0889,2.4712,1.6835,4.8351,0.1318,8.7264,3.0187,1.6467,6.0848,1.7757,1.9034,5.4276,5.1438,0.4389,0.7735,6.9518,6.6181,1.6687,2.8525,0.7815,3.8055,1.2105,0.0707,0.5048,0.0051,0.0037,0.7603,3.8028,0.1155,3.626,7.0215,3.1726,4.6238,4.9005,7.3317,3.2305,6.4725,0.0718,3.5807,0.6413,0.5475,0.1202,0.3271,4.1788,3.2436,1.358,2.9949,4.2253,0.9839,4.8086,0.2462,5.6761,5.7492,0.4492,2.3146,3.2383,0.8887,0.9624,1.4817,0.542,6.0261,0.7015,0.0131,0.0254,1.3128,1.4914,3.8513,1.0058,4.4417,1.2821,6.3697,0.0552,0.5922,3.9181,0.0003,1.9406,3.532,3.3853,1.3735,1.0828,1.9867,0.1447,5.2648,1.7564,2.7301,0.6462,3.787,0.6561,0.8055,1.8648,3.3221,1.5141,0.2881,2.2764,3.8524,0.524,4.406,2.8467,3.0147,1.6003,0.2831,4.5994,2.4023,0.5906,3.6001,4.5875,2.3624,2.5902,2.1614,6.3075,0.2396,1.1289,3.8872,7.8401,4.5566,4.6569,0.0462,2.3337,4.7531,0.0026,6.0134,4.1543,3.7352,2.0243,1.0877,7.3052,1.8567,2.457,2.6905,6.8294,1.3883,0.3882,0.2783,5.4411,0.3599,3.0736,2.6156,0.0532,1.8246,3.1671,0.1514,3.2755,5.4957,1.8466,0.1827,7.6202,3.804,0.9567,1.7575,2.8381,2.0652,5.5692,0.1294,1.4484,3.5202,0.5725,2.0039,3.2532,0.3722,0.8009,1.9082,4.6056,0.934,0.7361,4.4294,4.5838,8.4293,2.8028,0.0714,0.2286,2.3483,2.7205,2.2958,5.8122,4.1939,5.9922,3.3846,3.4969,0.2316,0.0012,0.1461,1.0846,1.7577,1.4254,1.6203,3.8743,8.2694,0.0432,4.2687,1.2326,1.7352,2.8686,2.3425,0.3755,4.3257,0.2717,2.5028,2.9448,0.4612,5.6385,0.1321,4.1677,1.8515,4.2377,0.7013,7.0525,2.0739,3.7204,0.0018,2.4116,0.1286,0.9369,0.0093,0.0001,4.1851,7.2315,0.015,0.0,0.7801,3.852,0.7836,4.071,0.7232,0.2604,3.0172,1.3233,1.7299,4.3197,3.1317,0.3231,1.31,3.4787,0.076,1.878,1.3932,0.2694,0.5087,1.592,2.0969,1.0707]}
{"prompt":"Syrian refugees could again seek to reach Europe in droves if aid programs are not sustained in five neighboring countries hosting the bulk of them , the United Nations said on Tuesday . The U.N.","text":"Syrian refugees could again seek to reach Europe in droves if aid programs are not sustained in five neighboring countries hosting the bulk of them, the United Nations said on Tuesday. The U.N. refugee agency said it was still working on a contingency plan that would work with host countries in Egypt, Jordan, Libya, Lebanon and Turkey and would require funding of $500 million. \"It would be a tragedy if some countries refused to engage and give in the face of the urgency of the situation,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said during an emergency summit in Brussels. \"We must be prepared to step in and provide assistance to millions on the border of Europe,\" he added. The refugee crisis was exacerbated by clashes between U.S.-backed rebels and hardline Islamist militants, who overran much of the country in April. Many thousands of Syrians have been forced to flee or flee on foot and across a sea of fire from their hometowns to Turkey's border and beyond. The United Nations estimates that nearly 1.5 million Syrians have been displaced since the beginning of the crisis and that the number could rise to 4 million by the end of the year. The refugee outpouring triggered a series of military operations by the countries hosting the migrants that have not yet stopped the flow. In Istanbul, authorities reported that the number of foreigners arriving in Turkey from Syria had doubled since Jan. 20, to 8,000, compared to 3,000 from just a month ago. The influx of Syrian refugees has raised tensions between Turkey and European neighbors over the issue. Several European countries have decided to ban the entry of Syrian refugees without any exception and Greece blocked the boats of migrants trying to reach Greek territorial waters. The Turkish interior minister has suggested an offer of jobs for refugees living in Turkey if they agree to go back to their country. In the meantime, the United Nations said it has managed to reunite 2.4 million migrants and refugees with their families. About one-third of all the refugees were returned home, mostly in the countries from which they fled.","token_len":417,"entropy":[8.9147,5.714,8.1075,4.9402,2.6674,3.3136,1.1062,3.3542,5.3455,0.0001,3.6724,7.0671,5.7558,1.8707,1.2798,4.8613,3.2679,7.1995,11.6435,0.1973,9.3229,1.7062,3.6288,0.0062,4.043,1.2257,1.8903,2.7375,0.057,1.171,1.3002,1.6708,0.1385,3.8495,3.574,0.001,0.0607,0.1316,0.98,0.0509,0.843,1.9612,1.7791,4.0851,2.759,1.6721,1.3494,6.5022,0.0184,2.4957,1.1891,6.3108,1.6112,5.7273,0.4292,3.2249,7.9201,0.5848,1.0022,0.3944,3.3144,0.5516,4.2509,0.9321,1.5963,3.931,1.8477,4.0649,6.5355,3.4842,2.4152,3.7205,0.1934,1.5753,3.6493,2.8005,2.9357,0.8326,1.5073,5.8394,0.5524,4.2251,3.3958,3.6869,0.3811,6.8596,3.3487,4.9246,2.293,1.7437,8.2529,0.0037,2.0259,5.2738,0.8383,1.2349,0.7406,0.5005,3.402,0.0016,0.0338,0.0154,1.6965,0.005,0.0954,0.0219,5.5983,1.4963,0.002,0.0796,0.0024,0.3016,3.7461,2.4926,1.5997,4.6437,0.8073,1.9826,0.4258,0.9655,1.8924,2.5026,3.0398,1.6109,0.9491,5.5746,1.9782,1.2125,3.0784,1.9525,1.3291,7.466,5.9786,0.4076,6.9665,3.178,2.7601,4.0412,0.4473,1.6642,0.1897,2.105,4.0697,0.4635,3.7019,3.2017,0.4568,6.6434,0.3714,5.273,0.0003,0.2658,0.5101,0.3493,2.8663,0.4678,7.5233,0.1826,1.3164,1.7685,2.2403,0.9384,5.623,0.0139,4.3654,0.003,2.1127,1.3597,1.2903,3.2984,0.8574,4.7755,4.4464,0.4745,1.7874,0.9086,2.2123,1.8665,0.6987,0.102,4.627,2.3193,5.7912,0.8743,2.4556,4.6646,3.6589,3.1569,0.035,5.4178,3.5897,3.1954,5.8192,0.1877,2.5569,2.6163,3.1597,1.0396,4.2933,4.9785,0.3811,1.8801,2.2193,0.8399,2.8181,0.6731,4.0257,2.2234,1.1271,1.2456,0.0119,1.3069,0.6675,1.5954,0.6855,2.4942,0.8817,2.259,0.0029,0.4872,3.9743,2.3982,2.4432,2.2818,1.856,2.4388,0.8877,1.0082,2.9509,0.374,0.4177,0.6005,0.0866,0.0174,1.1468,0.0621,0.4201,1.7711,4.1677,11.9302,0.0789,5.7404,1.2975,3.8259,0.0008,5.1885,2.7681,2.1976,1.2851,7.386,3.7245,0.3209,3.4848,3.5252,1.2967,4.3399,1.2009,4.8076,2.1895,0.703,0.8753,2.7358,5.3961,0.3975,4.8424,5.5424,1.3597,3.1642,2.2785,0.0391,6.1266,2.9365,0.8719,1.675,2.5823,1.3253,1.9451,2.78,1.9049,5.639,0.0216,3.9093,0.9309,2.5365,3.563,1.4246,1.6952,0.8112,3.4327,1.6898,3.7932,0.0101,1.0684,3.7342,6.6048,2.3739,1.1123,2.1992,0.5295,1.8619,3.6469,1.5328,2.6324,0.1374,0.9022,4.1723,1.8947,1.1521,1.0183,0.107,5.348,3.8396,3.3491,1.4126,3.2494,1.5271,5.8286,1.2743,1.0398,0.9194,5.9728,0.4154,4.9839,2.4102,2.4504,0.0486,1.2197,0.1105,5.4222,3.9692,8.2114,2.9787,5.5903,6.885,1.7677,6.0061,4.0777,2.1483,3.9046,0.0082,0.6858,4.7346,5.4754,0.0165,0.7029,1.9537,3.3823,4.85,0.898,2.7836,4.4499,5.0009,6.1313,0.6152,8.1146,1.7098,2.3179,5.1126,0.2588,1.5758,2.9369,0.9493,4.4432,0.0823,4.7257,2.5347,0.5184,1.1003,2.0443,1.4103,3.0332,2.552,3.2641,0.0243,1.8771,1.8463,0.9554,2.4994,1.5146,2.8936,6.7995,0.0749,7.7047,0.5549,4.0985,1.0282,2.1013,0.0064,3.6932,2.2262,1.0874,4.051,1.0345,0.4488,2.4907,4.2297,4.7137,0.7401,0.3963,0.2877,3.1301,2.4419,1.3958,3.6068,5.1164,3.4022,1.8285,4.7783,2.8501,2.1311,5.6596,4.3832,0.4328,0.1532,2.9952,1.0488]}

Although during the first two years after the formation of Transneft, the company achieved remarkable financial results, the fact that it had been built exclusively for Moscow made it less attractive to foreign companies to invest in this project, \u201d says the website. \u201cTransneft will continue to be a unique Russian energy company. We hope that the sanctions imposed on it will be eliminated by the United States. At the same time, we have seen that Transneft is ready to carry out its activities in the United States with the same efficiency, thanks to a strict implementation of its goals and priorities.\u201d At the same time, the company is fully confident about the work of its Russian partners, who have managed to overcome the difficulties of the economic sanctions on the energy market and continue their cooperation with Transneft.\nThe Transneft CEO stated that the company had managed to maintain its position on the international market despite the sanctions. He pointed out that Russian oil companies continue to attract investments from outside the country because of the stable growth in the price premium over world prices and the significant volume of oil that Russia can produce.","token_len":417,"entropy":[6.7351,0.1999,0.0362,0.1156,7.1674,3.8501,0.989,0.6576,6.2412,5.2633,3.8852,2.4131,0.8643,2.3706,14.4586,7.564,8.4048,9.7461,8.1091,8.5998,2.4606,0.0426,2.0504,5.8919,1.0782,0.0015,4.5487,4.7574,0.0833,8.4592,2.338,0.0989,0.9575,1.7345,2.0398,1.6861,6.4067,2.3131,3.5725,8.6048,3.3964,2.1405,1.9337,2.8641,0.0026,1.0594,4.6601,7.6514,0.7779,0.6774,6.0678,3.1255,2.0815,1.4053,4.3802,6.5745,2.1585,7.7817,0.0188,0.0528,0.4499,1.0097,12.7864,5.4997,0.2116,0.0012,4.3397,3.32,4.2479,3.7148,1.578,5.9456,11.5765,4.302,7.0114,2.9656,4.4446,2.9905,0.6433,3.0449,3.2709,5.3865,1.368,4.528,3.3593,6.8536,0.9445,6.2729,2.3236,1.6857,1.2259,1.9298,0.0124,1.5786,5.0463,7.0571,6.2458,3.3548,1.1132,8.5666,0.9919,2.2885,0.41,1.1055,1.0807,0.0458,0.0012,3.0603,0.549,0.4302,1.3242,1.2861,3.6574,5.228,2.0877,3.308,0.0375,2.2274,4.7211,4.9152,11.5887,1.7475,6.832,1.053,2.5199,1.2674,4.0648,4.1571,2.971,1.8752,6.2006,2.586,9.1739,7.3767,1.7781,0.002,0.0012,0.7516,0.5507,5.6096,4.302,0.8276,0.9273,4.2626,1.6407,1.1628,5.5189,4.2272,1.8802,1.9848,1.4963,5.9537,0.0621,1.531,3.6709,0.833,5.0761,1.7117,3.8953,3.5727,3.1889,1.0137,1.9057,1.8563,0.227,0.0018,5.9166,0.1604,2.8808,2.7535,5.6837,0.2159,4.0132,1.42,4.1716,5.7394,0.1173,3.7594,2.6135,3.648,0.5738,2.247,6.411,0.002,6.656,3.1275,0.6371,2.239,0.5003,0.9194,5.6596,8.2525,0.3923,3.1387,2.5425,0.4565,4.3503,0.4968,7.9166,0.0059,2.6544,0.2663,0.0032,0.7369,1.4641,1.0939,5.9353,6.4459,4.6172,1.9306,1.0047,1.949,5.9444,0.591,1.0384,3.6435,2.9522,6.0912,8.2466,1.5213,5.9163,4.1127,0.3807,3.8095,1.9588,0.5961,2.8133,3.0701,3.0347,1.0412,0.2834,4.4387,1.7,1.8135,4.9082,3.2101,5.2228,2.7892,8.7544,2.4474,3.6854,1.3511,3.9717,0.0935,0.0042,3.4086,0.5394,0.1421,2.1603,1.4912,5.5637,3.9604,0.9251,1.0096,2.6937,4.5863,3.0487,0.7028,1.3978,1.4368,3.8867,0.6805,3.8411,0.2915,2.8434,7.7076,2.9996,0.9359,3.7727,0.0094,1.714,6.2826,0.5791,0.1431,0.0032,0.1343,0.8128,3.544,4.5261,1.6126,3.2633,0.0413,0.0022,1.7051,3.2302,0.2503,5.5094,0.5523,1.5678,4.9305,1.2644,1.3848,3.7673,0.0064,4.0438,1.9768,2.6224,5.5817,2.4167,9.8401,0.0856,3.8567,6.3078,5.6965,0.4293,2.5562,6.8456,1.9584,4.1342,0.7822,2.9787,1.15,6.239,0.4723,0.0495,0.0043,0.0446,1.9325,1.735,1.6615,3.6746,2.2963,2.6712,1.0096,4.3724,2.724,1.1305,3.8271,0.9086,1.5654,3.1118,1.75,6.1629,0.2083,3.9397,1.2359,3.5067,1.0069,2.0539,4.677,2.7291,3.3531,2.0595,4.3351,4.1624,2.3727,3.3072,2.9438,3.3635,1.0392,1.9695,0.0267,0.0016,0.7742,0.8121,2.2418,3.1799,0.6343,0.0032,1.7268,3.1234,0.6046,1.1191,0.9833,3.8241,5.9642,0.0872,4.1885,1.2507,3.4972,2.8405,0.5789,3.9921,2.2678,2.8283,0.5554,2.9852,1.9068,2.6907,4.1842,0.2127,0.0992,4.0543,3.8137,1.8418,4.0234,0.0199,5.8098,3.7037,0.7386,3.94,0.6622,1.2655,3.9149,0.4607,0.9323,7.97,4.4495,1.8345,1.1041,4.3152,9.3172,5.4017,7.1259,1.8144,2.5083,0.9126,4.9299,5.0187,0.161,3.3507,3.0978,3.2332,2.7733,1.4872,0.7638]}

Michael Wolff, a former top reporter for The New York Times ; and Bill Barr, a former deputy attorney general - were talking about the possibility of meeting the special counsel later in the week.\nBarr said he wanted to speak with the president immediately - or maybe next week.\nCNN quoted a Trump campaign adviser as saying that a call from the special counsel would be a \u201c big deal \u2026 because the president was never given the opportunity to speak with any FBI in his life. \u201d","token_len":417,"entropy":[7.8969,4.6732,5.1289,4.1331,2.7073,0.8743,0.1424,0.1239,3.1436,0.0002,0.001,0.0182,1.2935,0.0306,4.3329,2.4369,0.3689,1.3144,3.9732,0.0065,0.9069,0.0482,0.0259,7.761,0.1972,4.7296,0.9642,6.4056,0.068,0.0172,3.7271,2.8636,0.002,0.2381,2.1262,2.4117,2.6382,0.025,0.0485,0.4363,3.8331,5.6786,0.0948,0.1338,15.0136,2.8455,5.1036,0.2009,2.5842,3.1857,0.0026,4.5062,1.8295,0.0064,0.0003,2.908,3.3505,4.4648,0.3895,0.0305,6.4243,1.5236,3.3186,0.2902,2.6167,1.6027,0.5618,10.6584,3.4979,0.0145,2.038,1.3373,0.0002,1.1691,1.1644,4.349,0.0002,2.0773,8.0274,0.0018,0.3187,0.8977,1.2874,0.0141,3.5153,4.8583,2.1662,3.8874,0.9734,0.6478,1.263,3.0821,0.0014,4.4847,1.2281,0.9541,0.0007,0.2175,2.2758,0.1534,0.489,1.5424,2.9685,3.0917,2.5683,1.172,6.4033,5.5872,0.2327,1.9148,6.1521,3.3334,3.5435,2.4908,0.1267,4.2885,1.5318,4.4407,1.1207,0.3568,1.5407,1.8631,1.7527,0.3568,2.5378,5.8602,4.2402,2.2722,3.0475,0.5836,1.7748,1.8078,1.1254,3.8536,0.4395,4.6171,0.0017,0.3257,2.5089,0.5781,1.4664,3.8999,2.8133,7.5516,5.1891,0.8794,0.4554,2.2323,5.4289,0.1746,0.9197,4.2637,6.0118,2.1028,2.249,5.4694,2.2866,3.2717,0.7392,1.2015,1.2594,2.6887,6.218,5.0982,3.3189,0.0752,0.5021,0.3421,3.7869,4.3024,4.0285,2.3113,3.7411,5.7541,1.0776,0.6033,5.2261,3.5034,6.498,2.738,2.4726,2.1461,0.7952,1.1921,0.7035,1.8374,1.0105,5.9784,2.2434,1.7093,3.6369,4.7154,0.2818,3.8642,3.3746,3.6904,0.8743,0.91,0.9681,0.5715,0.3891,1.5587,3.2365,0.0061,2.6222,6.251,1.4733,0.0015,0.9506,4.221,3.003,0.5872,4.0064,6.0754,0.6557,1.7659,4.9418,0.0173,0.3863,1.1658,0.5522,2.7018,0.1044,1.4975,0.8767,3.8408,3.6545,0.9863,0.5331,5.9549,1.5478,1.4131,6.4177,3.25,2.1267,0.7191,1.892,0.4697,0.7331,0.0062,2.254,5.0618,2.0689,1.9395,1.468,0.6974,8.4724,3.378,7.1166,3.2459,2.2176,2.825,0.0,0.1015,0.7544,0.448,3.8368,2.6682,0.3909,0.3391,3.3072,1.0804,1.7138,3.5256,0.2574,0.8465,3.9536,3.3705,0.0052,3.8575,1.4449,0.0026,1.2615,2.9614,0.9791,4.1947,8.8251,0.0282,0.3691,2.022,1.5901,0.1382,6.1981,2.8499,0.6009,0.787,1.4763,3.0093,3.7395,0.695,6.6812,1.4792,4.8621,3.66,5.1996,0.5533,4.3578,0.2114,0.3142,4.148,1.5557,0.1636,4.8361,0.7853,0.1286,5.7886,3.2144,0.4457,3.5911,6.0839,3.6082,0.1575,0.0992,1.608,9.3913,9.3366,3.2805,11.7377,0.4497,0.5922,1.6468,1.669,3.5913,9.2677,0.8599,1.4591,0.4365,0.0736,0.0443,6.2854,0.3476,4.1203,7.6936,3.855,0.6637,0.9163,4.3155,6.1356,0.0031,3.6711,1.0075,6.8631,1.0728,1.7137,2.185,0.3717,4.7963,2.0105,2.9756,0.0039,5.4615,1.8902,0.1216,1.9446,0.5514,0.4262,5.5672,0.1471,2.0675,1.4902,4.9484,0.3608,2.7149,0.9402,1.1557,3.3256,5.4242,6.0825,4.9522,4.724,4.0832,0.2567,0.8159,0.4353,4.484,4.8357,1.2567,1.8231,0.3541,2.4796,1.3051,0.1143,1.1255,3.5622,4.5652,2.185,1.4406,3.8681,0.0025,2.0221,0.9671,2.7014,18.3647,6.9446,10.2377,1.4275,8.1903,2.6785,2.0011,1.8143,2.7519,4.3716,3.5937,1.8279,1.0379,0.0828,2.4972,1.2169,3.7393,6.7346,8.0609,3.0205,1.8418,0.9417,8.2522,5.4245]}

It can be done with compassion and I believe Iran has the capacity of being a beacon of hope. \u201d\nThe BBC reported that six Iranian citizens had been detained last year under the controversial controversial Evin Shariat laws for security concerns and had been held in solitary confinement despite being allowed out of their cells.\nHe told the BBC : \u201cI am encouraged that the Iranian side \u2026 has taken action \u2026 to address our concerns about people convicted under the Evin Shariat legislation and those in prison or awaiting trial. \u201d\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossein Jaber Ansari told Reuters television : \u201c When you want to reach some political or social goal, you have always to know the rulebook. That is not the rules of a democracy or any rulebook that\u2019s ever existed in the world. \u201c\nHe said : \u201c If I see any person on TV that commits a crime, I will make sure that nobody is in jail. \u201d","token_len":418,"entropy":[9.156,2.3368,3.0264,0.0037,1.7527,2.7447,1.9789,2.7335,7.2868,6.2146,0.2294,5.0823,4.4251,6.2907,0.3157,7.0929,1.6086,0.7436,0.0693,1.7973,4.4431,0.111,0.7146,9.6032,6.8559,6.6112,0.2074,2.7028,4.9447,5.2794,0.0097,0.6458,5.9699,1.9113,0.7763,0.9803,5.1877,2.7953,1.7506,4.1271,0.2596,0.9448,0.6727,2.1134,2.9977,2.168,0.0875,2.0552,2.1205,4.6367,3.1357,1.9893,0.3119,4.0107,3.182,4.921,0.0079,3.9235,2.3865,0.6324,0.9262,4.2288,5.0135,3.8578,2.1331,1.6329,0.8669,1.7255,1.5336,1.075,1.1456,4.9243,2.1766,2.936,2.0314,15.4261,7.0245,10.9956,0.8657,1.7581,7.7531,1.5487,0.5539,15.9451,5.2154,1.1278,0.1447,1.5121,6.9823,1.7343,1.4002,0.0001,1.9271,0.0155,6.1971,0.0307,0.0308,0.7999,1.6375,0.097,0.2867,0.8444,8.3592,2.5002,1.7335,2.7449,3.5604,1.4972,3.9987,0.4558,0.4618,0.4747,1.2502,3.4607,2.2737,3.497,6.4185,6.148,0.4446,1.3368,2.18,1.8247,4.9653,1.4271,1.8097,4.3831,0.7719,5.7145,2.7145,3.4036,0.9973,0.6084,0.459,1.1506,2.1171,4.9896,0.4035,4.2148,3.4297,2.0138,4.541,0.3674,0.0189,1.8565,4.1639,2.1147,0.1976,0.0753,0.5139,0.3452,0.2715,0.1772,0.0326,0.1237,0.0357,0.844,2.3068,6.1268,3.6641,7.9615,3.3321,5.6014,4.6543,4.9304,2.5826,0.8526,2.9608,7.7961,6.688,8.1649,6.4577,2.0458,0.3101,2.7735,0.0163,0.1837,1.5547,6.7118,0.3142,0.6403,0.9014,5.8836,4.5338,2.3454,1.8835,0.4807,5.4527,5.9358,0.0049,6.153,2.7246,4.6461,4.6469,1.9043,6.2359,3.0816,1.3501,2.7569,0.1774,3.5732,3.6121,4.5549,4.3931,8.6096,4.9118,1.071,2.4307,3.1496,4.1352,3.9256,1.3573,2.4518,1.441,4.9322,1.0497,1.2819,0.8698,3.1429,2.4335,0.3907,0.2507,3.1606,6.3368,1.0362,3.6437,3.0101,5.2851,1.7174,1.6423,3.0983,4.2847,2.9928,0.8766,4.2465,0.6355,1.4209,1.8624,2.1194,0.1161,0.6612,2.6693,1.1592,3.2762,0.5801,7.028,1.4891,2.6,2.3574,0.2298,1.1148,4.7149,2.219,3.9658,1.1426,3.6881,4.4341,9.6592,0.1652,6.2601,4.3927,6.0588,4.6789,8.0764,4.4587,2.7855,3.502,0.7502,2.6499,1.2838,2.7584,0.0321,6.4782,1.7959,3.1833,5.6484,0.7878,1.9282,1.292,1.2293,0.9177,5.4121,3.2918,0.9659,0.3363,3.3694,0.1553,0.464,6.0951,3.083,6.6662,1.4468,1.4996,2.2634,5.4436,7.697,1.2593,2.3699,2.8857,4.8006,1.5737,3.6679,5.7369,0.4343,2.3342,6.0931,7.4965,2.935,0.6348,1.646,0.003,0.1784,0.0018,3.7881,2.0668,3.2352,3.9488,2.5825,4.1241,4.8331,0.5451,1.1263,2.2459,0.0508,0.4904,3.3045,8.4043,0.656,1.6916,2.5956,1.5169,2.2958,2.2039,0.0013,2.7315,1.1009,7.5134,0.0184,1.6244,3.7466,6.6499,3.9778,0.2231,1.106,6.2254,2.3361,5.1362,0.2342,4.8597,4.9823,5.1823,4.1152,3.2931,4.332,0.5258,0.7476,0.9056,7.2193,1.3207,5.8286,2.0223,8.0151,9.1164,1.0033,3.4689,0.9846,3.6499,2.117,7.0379,1.4341,4.0567,2.822,3.3329,3.2493,4.1114,3.2986,1.7527,10.3793,2.7333,0.9797,5.0318,7.0407,2.1844,1.2767,2.3544,0.4001,2.4655,3.965,1.2327,2.7455,0.7717,3.8209,0.0756,0.0884,3.6513,3.6282,3.5765,2.7354,3.8072,4.1864,4.4005,2.8451,7.2631,0.899,0.3121,0.8043,0.9745,1.2486,4.305,1.0462,0.6142,6.5349,1.5274,2.9975,1.1629,1.1293,2.035,0.1249]}

Paul also backed down on a controversial tweet in July that read, \u201cThere is only room for one supreme court justice.\u201d\nMr. Paul has even suggested that the Senate should put forward its own version of Mr. Trump \u2019 s proposed tax bill and see whether it could pass \u2014 an idea that some Republicans have been calling.\nStill, Paul has made some notable statements about the potential economic consequences of tax cuts for the nation \u2019 s highest earners, including that it could lead to joblessness and increase interest rates. In an interview on CNBC \u2019 s \u201c Squawk Box \u201d on Friday, he suggested the president should stop attacking tax cuts for billionaires and instead focus on a potential federal spending deal.\nOn Monday, he took a new approach, tweeting to Mr. Trump: \u201cMake your $200 back and spend on American jobs and our military.\u201d\nBut a little later, Mr. Paul tweeted: \u201cI do think our government should be reducing taxes on the people that invest to grow their businesses and jobs.\u201d\nPaul was referencing Mr. Trump \u2019 s tax plan, which calls for a one-time $400 million per year tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. It would also lower the tax rate for working families from 35 percent to 21 percent and introduce a new tax on the wealthiest Americans in the form of a tax on capital gains \u2014 with some income brackets receiving a flat 10 percent tax to fund schools, hospitals, and the Pentagon.","token_len":418,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.3359,3.6651,0.0009,1.8472,2.3853,4.2665,9.0784,0.0742,0.0011,0.9277,5.4411,6.5645,0.642,8.2765,4.2767,2.4451,0.0733,4.6085,1.6487,0.4119,5.0628,3.2713,0.0317,5.1188,2.1012,0.0047,15.0902,6.8728,8.1238,6.7298,1.3811,2.8707,2.6984,1.5069,5.2181,5.6674,0.3482,1.5499,2.2391,5.2863,2.1607,5.9125,3.9679,1.3014,6.6557,2.232,12.8034,3.9724,6.7065,2.7727,4.5397,3.6269,11.389,1.4944,3.9998,5.1963,1.6682,20.404,2.2269,5.9429,0.035,0.2044,0.0336,2.7751,1.6634,4.521,0.6205,1.4825,0.0304,4.2367,8.4271,1.4402,7.2457,0.0269,0.0479,2.8407,0.4347,1.6886,1.1642,0.2399,5.0866,4.7761,6.7363,1.317,0.9728,0.1897,0.7467,1.7569,0.2191,2.1084,1.9243,1.9181,4.2599,4.6601,3.4359,0.5376,3.363,4.5302,4.7427,4.2033,2.7401,4.6833,4.3072,3.6437,2.3356,0.0403,6.1561,0.3389,5.5777,0.8991,4.5514,2.6217,5.0029,3.7303,1.635,1.2965,4.7503,4.4946,2.7837,4.5176,1.8019,4.0011,0.6754,5.1716,1.9615,8.5021,0.8353,4.2987,6.876,0.1635,1.6916,9.0948,1.1993,0.2297,2.1048,2.8301,3.7903,1.0195,10.8285,0.0008,2.0398,2.345,5.0425,3.8466,1.0095,1.8174,3.5718,1.3502,5.4734,3.8902,3.5641,0.1421,1.732,0.0639,2.8555,0.0005,0.0812,2.8189,0.2732,0.1292,4.904,0.5147,2.9186,4.3457,6.1948,2.7217,1.2012,3.4965,0.9977,5.7138,4.0201,1.0646,0.8686,3.9788,1.5838,1.1374,2.4431,3.3911,8.1577,0.5349,13.0086,0.0527,2.8815,1.4543,3.7463,3.2902,4.9484,3.2504,1.4735,1.2791,5.1935,4.816,1.7612,0.1667,3.7705,1.5594,1.5631,0.7339,4.5293,3.79,0.409,0.058,5.2629,0.1791,1.6668,1.4566,4.1579,3.174,1.4131,1.3775,0.0224,5.1067,4.9658,0.9192,4.4479,5.7313,0.1077,0.8545,3.6499,2.2989,0.3753,1.9533,3.0755,4.7166,1.9984,0.0506,9.7876,0.3749,14.0418,0.0527,0.2143,2.9299,3.5701,2.438,2.8549,0.1517,1.0314,4.3368,2.6106,3.3055,2.5708,4.5841,5.1253,3.9931,1.0465,0.957,5.3623,0.9962,2.3275,0.9063,0.1092,4.0684,5.5027,6.6558,3.0293,3.5677,1.9662,0.3156,4.9722,1.2018,0.223,1.7168,4.1017,1.2993,6.0467,2.2789,1.6739,3.0231,3.9207,3.6961,0.0016,0.1496,1.8876,1.7291,1.4536,4.9746,3.2319,5.4808,1.267,2.207,3.383,4.9457,4.5369,5.3912,1.351,2.6086,2.5604,2.0183,0.6949,2.3075,1.232,0.7661,3.7888,4.5425,4.9956,4.1106,0.5355,3.6501,0.0006,0.2096,3.2243,2.2842,0.3231,0.6451,2.0424,4.1811,2.8933,3.9908,3.479,0.8127,1.607,6.9603,1.3038,1.2868,1.0471,5.0912,2.6517,4.1003,5.9218,4.4876,3.3282,1.7164,1.6944,4.1698,0.6184,1.8574,0.477,0.6523,4.6638,3.8332,4.8313,4.1015,0.0014,0.1251,2.6336,0.0665,0.0347,1.4199,0.2168,1.2902,0.6958,4.5899,0.0508,1.6336,4.9217,0.3322,1.2273,2.3137,4.2441,3.4387,6.8149,0.2308,1.1603,0.2015,0.5345,1.0259,1.0446,0.256,0.8706,3.1868,1.512,2.005,3.9704,0.8374,2.4994,0.3945,0.764,4.4898,0.8927,5.3559,0.7951,0.3536,0.0482,3.995,0.1485,2.5834,7.4037,0.8089,2.9007,1.7505,2.09,2.4065,2.0437,0.841,4.1935,1.1162,1.4495,0.0012,0.6964,2.5994,2.3659,2.4993,0.019,4.7162,5.1874,3.4514,5.0109,6.8265,8.1265,1.5361,4.085,3.6865,0.1233,1.8731,6.9383,5.1812,9.3073,1.4249,1.2956,0.8883,0.8952,3.2953,4.6272,0.3349]}
{"prompt":"A Republican candidate backed by President Donald Trump for a U.S. Senate seat from Alabama is expected to finish a distant second in a primary election on Tuesday , but will still have enough votes","text":"A Republican candidate backed by President Donald Trump for a U.S. Senate seat from Alabama is expected to finish a distant second in a primary election on Tuesday, but will still have enough votes to win in a June runoff.\nDemocrats are not backing President Biden\u2019s push for more aggressive action on climate change, a campaign official said Monday.\nTory MP Mark Darcy, an Environment and Climate Change Committee peer, told reporters he believed \u201cit\u2019s just a bit hypocritical to say we need to make more progress on action on climate change to achieve the goals we set ourselves for 2030 and 2050\u201d in the European Union Climate and Energy Package while continuing to invest heavily in coal-fired energy.\nDarcy, who led his party in opposition in the House of Commons during Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit saga, said there would be a \u201cstep change\u201d in efforts to meet emissions reduction targets.\n\u201cIn the event of UK withdrawal no other European state can meet their climate pledges. The UK does now, and it is doing it on a huge scale if you use coal in Britain,\u201d he said.\nWith the election looming in the United Kingdom, the poll could signal an important change in the future of European climate policy.\nThe research firm Opinium released preliminary results of the poll today morning, which showed Ed Miliband, the leader of Britain\u2019s Labour Party and a fellow European policy expert on climate change at the University of East Anglia, leading on the issue across the two major parties.\nThe poll also showed an increase in support for stronger climate legislation in the United Kingdom compared with the result from last year.\nElection analysts estimate there is less support for a hard Brexit than there was in a 2016 referendum that led to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. The polls are also expected to reflect the uncertainty many voters in the British parliament feel over whether the country should leave the EU, and the impact the pandemic would have on the country\u2019s economy and trade.","token_len":418,"entropy":[9.3057,3.0006,7.9639,0.5326,3.0492,0.9592,0.0174,4.3717,3.5408,3.4588,0.0085,0.012,0.1716,0.1583,0.0515,5.0646,3.285,2.5556,4.0558,0.0531,7.0154,2.5213,4.1813,0.9987,0.6725,2.1216,3.1208,2.3819,2.7366,1.2557,1.2803,2.6567,4.0954,3.2902,1.8653,4.5272,1.5575,0.192,1.3809,3.7972,1.4185,6.0131,1.9071,0.8978,0.3077,26.5745,1.9773,4.9733,4.2162,5.8776,14.2427,14.1032,8.09,4.9344,7.4393,0.7356,3.9367,4.8353,2.7385,0.9114,1.6566,0.0267,1.1849,3.2573,5.0945,3.4325,0.5247,2.8077,0.3586,0.316,11.9774,4.0871,4.8235,4.3229,9.0253,0.8496,1.4334,3.6183,8.154,0.8165,1.3709,0.0278,3.4152,8.7604,0.4327,2.0383,2.1158,2.8169,3.6631,13.4367,6.6688,5.0852,3.5666,3.4421,0.4826,5.2758,1.1523,6.57,7.1228,1.6938,2.2525,3.9673,2.2283,0.5372,4.0008,2.9199,3.0995,0.7059,7.6818,0.9115,0.2168,0.0693,3.9953,4.5053,1.9673,1.887,1.665,1.2067,5.0102,3.338,5.9692,3.1635,1.581,2.7408,7.441,4.2937,1.3517,6.652,0.0411,8.4964,3.4529,0.4303,6.4569,9.0123,4.468,0.2095,4.6462,3.7882,0.0568,5.1685,1.6219,0.073,4.8728,1.1408,0.1314,6.7538,0.0,1.8457,0.693,5.0101,4.2253,0.6187,1.7768,6.6765,3.1174,0.871,2.956,0.5055,1.0464,4.006,7.5838,0.0048,9.3181,0.0262,2.3366,0.6571,0.0394,5.7107,7.8727,0.2691,0.8993,4.2272,3.0705,0.1445,1.799,12.0261,1.2978,11.9556,3.735,0.8781,1.7258,2.1415,6.4583,0.2128,4.1921,4.7486,2.4466,0.3054,1.4068,0.2184,2.9575,0.3729,4.2831,1.4889,4.6896,0.5373,9.3582,3.0194,9.0603,4.2457,2.8344,4.0783,3.5492,1.8804,2.7937,3.7322,4.2515,2.0524,3.047,2.0835,4.7918,6.0714,1.3858,1.5886,2.5835,1.5526,3.9938,2.5431,2.9231,1.0312,5.4181,0.104,5.8326,4.3342,4.6958,4.8347,4.3186,5.1251,2.1199,6.8225,3.9768,1.6162,0.2538,0.1528,0.2756,5.9468,1.5883,3.0938,2.831,2.9079,2.4571,4.5837,1.4081,0.5489,1.8885,7.0162,4.7728,5.3136,3.2043,2.8343,3.3014,0.3028,1.1596,5.2657,0.423,3.5481,2.9915,0.4825,0.7313,0.6914,2.3756,6.6249,3.8307,6.9521,0.6055,0.1666,3.9535,5.6529,0.2574,2.5516,1.5695,1.7098,4.996,5.9211,1.1472,2.3681,1.3767,9.1081,0.0104,2.3426,0.4457,2.418,0.0697,3.212,5.5612,0.8262,0.005,1.0741,0.1793,3.0884,2.3873,6.0916,5.8786,7.4618,3.4172,4.7275,0.9372,0.1602,3.2547,0.5272,1.5226,0.0033,3.3764,0.0078,0.0001,0.1852,3.2241,5.2069,2.146,1.5734,7.4239,0.748,4.5581,1.5034,0.827,0.4184,0.4033,2.0182,1.1403,2.5207,0.7814,4.9376,2.2008,0.1039,0.7611,0.1117,6.5952,4.9462,4.3284,1.5069,0.7801,1.1349,1.0685,4.9683,0.9475,1.3646,7.3721,3.5122,2.1391,0.9014,2.4656,0.6247,5.2802,1.7664,5.7854,5.5166,3.2224,1.8357,4.7969,2.9694,0.1724,1.7966,5.867,1.1274,1.9201,2.5329,0.8804,1.1874,4.2737,3.8834,2.4023,4.0954,2.784,0.1161,2.4149,6.6605,0.0364,0.1084,1.9191,0.0425,0.0088,0.5527,0.0207,0.4854,2.7294,5.0675,2.8864,2.9289,2.8196,0.0136,5.0536,1.4486,4.9219,6.0169,1.6738,2.4537,0.6725,4.7986,4.9439,3.792,2.2928,2.3557,2.1479,1.7129,3.1421,1.8548,0.2767,0.7259,2.0905,2.0704,1.9178,3.6723,2.5424,15.0217,0.4214,4.4275,0.0186,0.1026,1.1377,2.2888,2.6194,0.0271,0.0152,1.0553,2.1834,3.5754,0.3406]}

On June 5, 1987, three teenagers, each just out of high school, were found dead\n\u201cWhy are you here if you don\u2019t want me to do anything to help us?\u201d she asked, her pale face contorted in confusion. His gaze went to the body in the bed, and he was stunned to see the dead girl clutching its knees. \u201cCan I go now?\u201d She looked up at him in terror.\nShe looked up at them in awe. \u201cI was wrong. He was right. I\u2019m sorry, but I didn\u2019t understand. All those years, how can I prove he wasn\u2019t lying to me?\u201d \u201cHe wasn\u2019t lying to you.

To force you to give the details they wanted so they could claim you were lying. You told them the truth. That doesn\u2019t make you an accomplice\u2014it makes you a murderer.\u201d\nI wonder what he will write as his next book. There really had to be some new developments in that story that were not in the book. I hope it is the kind of novel that can be told over and over again because the reader will find new angles. I can't wait to see what he finds.\nI agree with the other reviewers that there was just too much information about J.J.'s sexual relationship with his friend.

The leaders of the 27 countries remaining in","text":"The second phase Brexit negotiations will be significantly harder than an already difficult first phase of talks, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday. The leaders of the 27 countries remaining in the European Union adopted the guidelines for their talks for a new period of Brexit in the aftermath of a difficult November vote in which a majority of Britons ditched the idea of leaving the bloc with a vote for leaving the EU. \"Now it will be a real fight in a very serious phase of negotiation that we have been experiencing for almost three months now, \" Juncker said. \"Anything at all would be welcome from the British negotiating team. \" Britain will also be ready to take their country into another customs union if that is one option, he added, but that would mean Britain's leaving the customs union as well. \"We think that if there is no Brexit deal, Brexit can happen. It could happen only at zero terms,\" which means that any trade deal between Britain and the EU would be null and void once it is agreed to by the British parliament, Juncker said. British Prime Minister May will go to Brussels next month to try to reach a deal. But if negotiations are not concluded by March 19, at the end of a six-month transition period that is set out in the treaty, Britain is to move out of the customs union and the customs duties and quotas that exist between 28 EU member states and the country. The EU says it could use its legal powers to implement Britain's departure quickly should a deal not be struck by the time frame. But British trade unions warn of a possible drop in wages to protect jobs, while the Conservatives, the party's opposition, have called a by-election in Scotland on April 17 to send a message to their supporters that a no-deal Brexit is not in their long-term interest. An EU report is also due by March to help inform whether the transition period can be extended beyond the end of June. \"Now it needs to start again. This time I think the British negotiating team will come prepared, \" he said.","token_len":419,"entropy":[6.7499,5.2319,16.0077,3.5361,1.9359,1.5298,7.1927,3.8856,2.1293,7.1912,5.3449,1.5922,5.3876,0.7463,2.953,2.664,1.5435,8.7399,1.0322,0.7327,0.0654,0.019,0.0,0.0,0.0001,0.0,0.9401,1.324,1.9534,0.2947,3.6217,6.6317,0.5104,0.7389,3.1095,3.2439,7.0313,0.1289,0.0522,1.4661,0.0329,8.2816,2.3994,6.0333,1.8089,3.7812,3.0063,4.9146,1.9732,4.591,3.6415,0.2512,6.7968,3.1336,2.5294,4.9738,0.0037,3.1178,6.0081,6.9466,0.9676,1.9365,2.4187,3.7205,0.9263,0.2063,3.0338,11.4498,0.1226,0.632,5.0578,0.1059,1.3458,0.4369,0.958,6.5969,1.5122,3.8547,3.349,3.6574,0.7215,1.2929,0.4403,2.7784,5.1735,2.6722,2.8574,0.1966,2.1998,3.9531,5.5019,3.7439,3.9543,2.1295,4.1419,7.6853,2.1079,3.6552,4.2206,2.435,2.1304,3.1452,6.6212,1.0819,3.8326,2.1979,1.4433,2.2694,2.6189,6.9762,0.7276,0.0003,0.5042,0.8347,1.3089,8.9374,5.5559,0.3651,4.5928,0.7636,4.7655,5.075,0.8292,3.1777,5.4327,0.2687,1.5124,1.3877,10.2424,1.7064,3.4318,1.5393,5.3305,0.2998,2.6336,5.2547,5.0107,2.4906,5.1786,7.5561,0.0317,2.9564,3.7997,0.5593,6.6197,3.1102,2.214,3.2567,0.6079,2.4566,3.2404,3.1102,1.8361,3.2232,4.0666,2.4628,7.4772,0.1386,2.0504,0.0297,3.2355,2.5996,0.9787,0.6491,2.1575,4.8296,1.1591,3.4462,2.4687,0.4412,2.4206,4.7901,3.0551,1.1678,6.1043,3.6694,3.5681,2.0024,2.5396,2.8392,0.6827,5.0427,3.7592,9.5491,4.5767,4.2722,7.2541,2.3712,1.0811,3.2436,4.4832,0.6432,2.2553,1.1169,0.0364,0.2321,0.332,0.9842,1.2005,7.0986,0.3063,0.0006,5.7491,1.784,1.8497,3.1068,3.1645,1.8794,1.3179,2.9639,3.7764,2.3748,1.6178,0.0007,0.4803,0.1507,5.4057,0.8988,0.0032,6.7049,2.6896,5.4061,0.7676,0.498,2.582,2.1632,0.4659,4.093,0.1767,2.7362,0.5259,0.5204,2.8251,2.7668,3.6706,4.0616,2.1321,1.2478,2.581,1.8235,3.9605,5.6156,0.3956,6.3289,2.5294,3.7695,0.0041,4.2815,2.9805,0.0886,0.2597,4.4534,0.1231,3.0185,3.1274,2.7995,5.0897,0.244,1.0059,4.7457,0.6505,2.0196,3.5766,4.1385,5.7033,2.903,0.1109,0.1592,1.4659,0.0088,1.6607,3.7444,2.5564,8.8324,2.9243,6.7599,1.7974,5.784,3.0256,7.2477,1.3145,0.6561,0.0121,2.1059,1.5555,7.222,2.4544,1.9292,2.4145,4.1977,1.3563,4.8564,4.8776,2.961,4.605,1.4548,0.2421,5.5889,4.1682,0.0177,1.7933,9.4603,7.0653,2.6756,0.7573,1.5719,0.4999,2.6018,1.7677,1.2954,3.9387,10.46,2.7617,3.082,3.8971,4.6865,3.616,4.7895,2.9628,1.3309,2.6383,6.252,0.369,4.3148,4.3863,6.73,3.1409,2.3553,3.4854,2.271,4.6615,4.1415,2.4701,3.6559,7.6032,4.1337,1.3042,2.0645,2.4051,4.5232,9.8895,0.3683,0.0439,2.0289,4.658,1.5924,3.6761,3.5038,1.2448,7.2438,0.6136,0.7423,0.5865,4.4362,3.254,0.6361,2.8998,4.2736,0.753,0.054,0.3466,1.4768,1.6948,2.5678,1.8513,3.859,0.1524,0.0605,1.3098,0.1064,5.6796,1.9823,5.5485,5.206,5.5528,0.6851,3.7316,4.2927,3.5225,6.0886,4.8861,6.6783,1.7987,7.1923,1.7765,2.8166,0.2477,1.8201,2.6933,1.5841,2.7431,0.0069,2.6271,0.5942,2.5521,5.7975,2.2643,7.5505,0.0996,5.2031,4.3773,2.022,3.1736,2.9163,4.481,1.1512,1.9346,2.3523,2.6058,0.0628,1.5286,4.7017,4.761,2.741,5.9955,3.0422,0.2495,0.2247]}

Grover","text":"Congressional Republicans are ramping up discussions on overhauling the U.S. tax code that a prominent Republican anti-tax advocate said on Wednesday will produce a bill by September with a hefty corporate tax cut. Grover Norquist\u2019s National Taxpayers Union (NTU) announced plans to file a tax cut bill by mid-September, the Associated Press reported. The party will hold discussions over two weeks with various tax experts to consider tax changes to be proposed by the White House team of Robert Lighthizer (trade), Peter Navarro (Mexico-Canada free trade agreement) and Steven Mnuchin (American tax cuts), NTU said. Norquist on Wednesday also released an audio version of his remarks to lawmakers in his office to announce the plans. \u201cThe plan that was laid out a couple of weeks ago is on the table,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cIt\u2019s a package of ideas, and it is a package of ideas that are aimed at getting a higher tax rate on the corporate sector back in order to support that part of government job creation.\u201d. In his office on Wednesday he said. The Republican plan would not be as large a budget deficit-reducing measure as the first White House proposal he was given a week ago, in which the Republican plan would increase the top rate of individual income tax from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. (Photo: REUTERS\/Staff) The plans, as well as a revised proposal that the White House sent to Congress, will focus on lowering the average tax rate going forward rather than cutting taxes on the wealthy, Norquist added.\u201dIf you have got a 40 percent tax rate on a 50 percent tax bracket, you\u2019ve lost 50 percent of the income,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I talked to them about that, I got that they were open to that\u201d. Norquist will continue to push for his plan in the future. \u201cMy priority \u2026 is to make that the central issue of the next fiscal and trade bill,\u201d he said","token_len":420,"entropy":[10.163,3.3628,2.362,7.0837,0.0043,0.0056,7.6206,1.5299,5.6399,0.0405,0.528,3.4148,0.0007,0.0017,0.0444,1.4021,0.0952,3.6684,7.1264,6.9368,1.2875,9.8109,0.0045,0.4177,3.1335,2.1812,5.8476,1.9183,2.5194,5.8062,1.1369,4.0951,4.3481,4.2934,4.6272,1.745,6.1344,6.219,0.2654,0.3336,1.0913,11.9094,0.0585,0.0041,0.0,12.2938,11.1539,6.3923,4.6034,1.1985,0.0335,0.3949,3.0392,1.2736,0.0205,0.3201,4.4631,4.1732,0.6937,3.3391,0.6512,2.5537,4.9971,0.9549,3.5427,3.2979,0.0498,0.9517,1.418,3.4158,5.0569,0.0125,0.2728,0.3768,2.0666,6.2129,2.714,2.2401,7.4339,5.0246,6.4319,1.9923,1.5369,4.9354,2.5162,1.7102,2.0347,4.039,4.2525,2.6849,3.3288,4.1165,4.2977,1.0973,0.9191,3.9706,0.0004,8.4723,3.9937,5.8551,3.2315,0.0702,0.0007,4.8444,9.5438,2.9335,4.9017,0.3669,0.0,0.1591,11.0881,5.1981,6.372,8.7124,0.0326,0.8354,1.2111,0.0372,3.4632,0.28,0.0,0.1109,6.2287,3.4218,3.7878,3.178,7.9205,0.0011,2.0447,1.1075,5.5509,0.0022,6.138,0.3096,3.8975,3.7749,2.4902,4.1333,4.9112,0.0181,1.5709,4.5482,2.1667,3.9279,2.6342,4.0216,2.6777,4.4506,5.0055,1.5284,3.2205,0.7464,7.865,5.9869,4.1809,3.0591,4.109,3.285,4.7581,0.037,5.445,2.0661,0.6904,0.5414,0.0236,1.6082,6.3291,0.9989,0.385,2.0131,9.7128,7.8601,4.3028,0.0033,0.4377,0.6459,3.4342,0.4219,2.4346,7.6443,7.5922,0.0795,1.9311,5.2869,1.4812,4.4603,2.2439,2.3646,1.3044,1.995,1.7649,2.3531,0.6607,0.7409,0.8964,2.8527,6.3201,0.1436,3.073,3.22,6.0558,0.6776,0.2958,1.7228,1.2458,6.019,3.32,8.4389,2.428,3.1967,0.1119,4.7764,5.1133,5.5806,0.0267,6.6402,7.2039,0.1242,1.3482,1.8454,1.7558,6.5931,4.8299,2.7252,6.0862,2.8758,0.2799,4.7811,1.4049,6.0143,2.9491,4.2209,1.708,1.6007,4.7935,3.1612,3.769,3.1709,2.5578,5.6748,3.2228,3.7193,0.897,2.4594,1.6124,0.4261,1.0545,6.6227,6.3079,0.0005,1.6465,6.6429,3.8589,4.5337,3.6948,4.6951,0.224,0.9964,4.6127,1.5216,1.8013,3.3731,2.4805,0.907,3.0817,0.6965,2.5668,1.1888,1.7834,4.6472,0.3669,0.1955,1.6079,0.8588,0.4828,0.0725,1.3811,0.0331,0.0596,0.0171,0.8148,5.276,5.1269,0.7292,4.7655,0.8133,8.2584,2.0923,3.0829,6.1863,3.0983,4.5133,2.4599,0.0112,2.4296,4.6461,2.9618,2.3218,4.032,1.7677,0.0007,5.5992,0.4937,1.8476,2.0602,2.5949,4.4032,0.1416,3.9166,0.7271,6.1403,1.9476,0.1472,9.2216,0.1492,7.0766,0.0019,3.1712,2.2677,1.2164,0.9204,1.5514,1.4404,2.177,0.002,3.2772,0.105,6.0209,1.2008,8.1678,3.6997,3.1585,7.8406,1.1718,7.9994,0.3534,1.2656,0.4295,1.4438,3.8872,6.1063,0.54,2.3639,2.687,0.5403,1.1401,8.1155,3.9282,2.4193,6.2583,5.2672,0.791,0.6328,2.527,3.0764,3.4475,2.3032,1.2288,4.6564,0.1883,0.1698,2.4974,0.4609,5.8025,2.8673,3.7339,0.4033,3.6793,1.8299,2.4263,0.7162,1.6217,3.963,3.5928,1.9414,1.5267,4.828,0.1515,2.7422,8.2128,1.3671,1.5259,6.258,0.0041,5.5018,3.8534,0.1733,2.7474,0.8562,5.5179,1.2704,3.1579,0.9216,4.3395,1.4972,3.1455,0.2917,5.206,4.1545,8.7229,0.4408,0.6913,2.2592,4.4249,3.8515,5.4049,2.2193,1.312,1.0199,2.7309,4.0426,7.1551,6.2853,3.9601,1.632,1.1293,0.3508,1.8655,0.2157]}

Protesters carried placards reading \"Against Trump\" as they marched, chanting \"Israel apartheid, Trump ally.\" Speaking to Agence France-Presse, a Jakarta resident said the group was about 50,000 strong. A U.S diplomat told the Associated Press Trump s decision \"undoubtedly reflects a desire on his part to create a narrative of unilateral action that legitimizes his unilateralist, expansionist policies.\" Other countries around the world also recognize Israel as a Jewish state. Trump took the controversial decision to move U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem back in September. The move has triggered protests and condemnation from around the globe, but for now is still supported by the United Nations and the European Union. On Sunday, the world s largest Muslim-majority country had the largest Muslim march in decades. The Islamic republic has since made the decision to transfer its embassy to the city, which Palestinians argue is their birthright as the capital of their former state. Israel has also rejected the move, claiming that it is not a matter of international law but sovereignty. On Saturday, a Palestinian official told AFP that his Islamic nation is not backing down despite the protests. \"I believe that the protest movement is the continuation of the resistance of the Palestinian people,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Palestinians and many other Muslims also consider the annexing of the Temple Mount and parts of East Jerusalem to Israel a grave violation of international law and a crime against humanity. Protests have erupted in Saudi Arabia as well. A coalition of rights groups staged a protest in the capital, Riyadh, urging Washington to rescind the move. \"We have never supported Israel and we will never support their regime,\" said protester Abdulaziz al-Harbi.\nA coalition of rights groups staged a protest in the capital, calling U.S. move a violation of international law","token_len":421,"entropy":[8.2894,0.1591,0.4967,0.1999,4.6773,4.7629,3.0967,1.746,4.3874,1.8603,0.8714,8.6632,11.0396,11.6312,3.8635,2.6267,4.556,0.9936,1.2175,3.0941,1.4535,1.65,1.4964,0.9241,6.3789,0.0935,0.0447,0.2137,0.4561,0.162,0.003,8.9611,2.305,0.0612,1.7415,1.7882,0.0014,0.1141,0.0396,0.0038,0.1521,0.1553,6.5584,3.8535,1.1212,0.0067,1.2829,0.4738,8.1152,1.2758,2.087,4.2614,0.1678,1.0184,3.3774,1.9541,0.8519,5.6285,7.818,3.0394,2.1869,7.58,1.5026,7.2753,1.1607,7.4201,0.0165,0.0027,0.2751,0.0008,0.0,0.7568,2.8261,6.0157,7.1768,1.6654,2.106,4.2691,1.5018,5.8165,3.8132,2.4473,0.2125,2.2863,0.8499,4.4079,3.248,0.001,0.0454,11.0952,2.3356,2.4326,3.4768,0.0008,7.5526,4.2087,0.8,1.969,7.6107,0.5245,4.2378,1.6527,3.689,4.0983,1.8123,0.0941,0.2431,4.6771,0.9065,7.5832,1.5345,8.4582,2.8487,2.0025,6.4139,0.054,2.2783,4.3536,4.8983,4.2409,5.9874,0.0069,1.1096,0.8147,6.4975,6.365,3.94,0.0157,0.0846,2.9578,7.9528,2.2709,0.8287,1.449,0.8962,0.092,0.9536,4.3555,5.192,2.5994,5.1231,0.4275,1.6667,4.0288,2.739,0.0003,0.0031,0.0144,2.2966,1.1043,1.0681,0.3899,0.0683,0.0002,0.1489,0.1677,7.3048,0.116,3.2093,0.8788,2.1935,0.962,2.8835,4.4445,1.6272,2.358,3.4376,0.5633,5.439,0.0046,3.2916,1.5783,3.6317,5.8146,2.0743,5.3727,4.2118,6.5765,0.0673,2.0945,1.7653,1.9509,1.3482,1.9315,3.3681,0.0151,0.216,4.2479,1.0166,0.3004,2.0679,5.273,8.5724,1.6601,0.6704,2.2884,0.0215,0.6748,5.621,3.5226,1.8906,0.9862,7.2704,0.8865,4.8382,1.047,2.0464,4.4205,6.2252,3.6308,5.0898,4.723,3.1585,1.8322,0.3992,6.502,1.4615,0.4796,0.7435,2.5564,2.8391,1.6635,1.7736,7.273,5.6352,0.783,5.7312,8.2953,0.0068,4.5285,3.5833,2.1771,0.308,1.5066,6.0862,1.5659,0.3436,4.6297,1.4508,2.6125,5.0556,0.8874,1.2243,1.1425,3.8089,1.4308,1.2554,1.4076,2.5955,1.9256,4.8223,0.3563,4.7329,0.1133,3.0822,9.263,0.6867,3.9502,1.9352,0.1351,2.4982,2.307,3.088,1.5705,2.1339,0.6366,4.6542,7.546,5.2332,2.9809,2.173,5.7612,1.2291,5.923,1.1551,5.9104,0.6403,0.9834,3.0819,3.2421,1.1107,1.5753,7.0943,2.1945,1.1138,3.7469,5.9537,0.0827,0.818,4.7272,2.0541,0.7595,1.6789,0.2331,1.5096,1.8794,1.2345,0.2564,0.5904,0.4396,0.9515,0.1214,3.2641,0.0002,0.0097,0.0021,1.0861,2.2185,4.1564,4.0785,4.1476,2.1916,2.0616,3.5761,6.0752,1.2105,8.5708,0.067,0.2655,1.7265,4.1809,0.0023,3.014,6.8615,0.0169,2.9201,0.0002,0.764,4.3771,1.1937,4.6389,0.9229,0.0335,1.5675,0.0347,1.9623,1.88,4.4141,0.3248,0.0756,0.2187,6.5657,0.0005,1.7689,3.5552,0.7237,5.8329,0.0052,4.8454,0.8653,1.6841,2.7381,6.1014,0.0401,5.4125,0.1895,6.3285,0.5157,1.4545,1.0019,2.2981,1.2909,2.0481,0.5844,0.319,6.1787,5.6609,0.1936,4.5935,0.5523,1.4002,0.4536,2.1704,1.8219,3.1076,4.4313,2.7909,4.0415,2.4454,1.1268,1.648,1.5568,0.5863,4.9713,5.3153,1.1634,0.6933,6.7025,4.1911,3.242,0.048,1.8166,0.1941,4.9107,2.7753,1.2323,3.4603,7.8057,6.1759,0.004,0.0256,0.0026,0.0227,0.0025,0.0028,0.0059,0.0094,0.0058,0.0228,11.4227,7.8411,0.0003,0.0068,0.0237,4.9544,1.1758,2.3311,0.0043,0.0726,0.0041]}
{"prompt":"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on Sunday cleared the first hurdle towards taking part in next year s presidential election , even though the central election commission has previously ruled him ineligible to run .","text":"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on Sunday cleared the first hurdle towards taking part in next year s presidential election, even though the central election commission has previously ruled him ineligible to run. Asked about the ruling, the opposition politician called it an \u201cabsurd decision\u201d and said he expects to appeal to Russia s top court. Speaking in front of thousands of supporters gathered in front of the Russian government TV channel, TV Dozhd, Navalny said the ruling was \u201cthe latest in a long series of stupid mistakes by the Kremlin. \u201d Mr Navalny, the Kremlin-backed leader of the popular movement called \u201cRed November, \u201d said his opponents on the election commission should go to jail instead of him being disqualified and thus forced to find a new legal avenue. One of the ways he plans to challenge the ruling is by suing the election commission for damages caused by the decision. \u201cThe fact that I have to sue is not the end of the world, \u201d said Navalny, accusing his rivals on the election commission of \u201cbribery and corruption. \u201d He added that if the opposition parties join forces, the Kremlin will find a way to stop his campaign. \u201cI won\u2019t be beaten. No matter what, I will fight, \u201d he said. Navalny said he had been notified of the decision before the vote, but said he would not give up his plans to contest the election. The campaign against Mr Navalny and other opposition figures in Russia has escalated over the past month. The central election commission on Thursday disqualified the former presidential candidate of the main opposition party for not registering as an independent candidate. The ruling followed the previous week s investigation of Mr Navalny, the result of which the head of the election commission, Vladimir Solovyov, declared to be \u201cvery significant. \u201d The accusation of being a foreign agent is the latest attempt by officials to silence opposition figures, several of whom have faced criminal charges and arrests for campaigning on the streets. Mr Navalny has repeatedly dismissed such fears as baseless.","token_len":421,"entropy":[8.495,2.1293,6.2596,0.0285,0.0606,0.0004,3.9074,1.9115,9.3434,0.8229,5.2288,1.0821,5.493,4.9483,4.1557,0.0497,5.1686,0.7225,13.3655,9.7191,1.0058,1.9119,5.1677,0.9787,1.6935,5.8382,2.8658,3.3931,1.6159,5.3165,2.4968,5.0325,0.8341,1.1855,1.974,0.5298,8.0335,1.629,0.8599,4.031,0.8668,2.1986,2.7875,5.4642,5.2571,1.4524,2.3468,18.1169,6.3311,7.1178,0.059,1.5597,3.2136,8.8075,1.6583,0.9128,1.6884,4.808,2.0132,4.2421,2.326,4.8587,9.2905,4.16,0.993,0.8283,6.7741,2.5533,4.1858,0.0008,4.9447,0.0885,1.3434,4.7139,0.7829,2.7051,0.0014,0.6047,2.8065,6.3866,8.8002,2.4472,1.0824,10.3302,9.294,0.1933,0.029,0.902,0.33,0.0001,0.674,2.2787,3.506,1.3966,7.43,1.0663,4.092,3.973,1.4044,0.1381,1.7042,1.8698,0.0762,9.1025,5.3239,1.2512,0.8917,2.141,2.0056,3.015,6.597,7.3429,1.3982,0.0009,2.1547,2.7398,5.1157,2.7404,1.7503,2.542,0.2107,0.4836,5.7719,4.0486,5.0703,8.7016,0.2838,6.6943,6.2949,1.4613,6.2108,2.7004,2.6983,3.3114,4.5635,5.2127,0.7791,6.6475,0.2186,2.8255,4.5591,1.1468,2.5803,4.2752,0.3431,6.3648,4.3066,2.9539,3.6024,6.3822,5.843,0.2005,7.8819,0.8865,1.1573,7.8073,3.8809,1.2082,6.7653,0.6021,0.5385,8.0607,2.4656,4.1026,0.0293,4.6058,0.3881,1.9221,0.4411,1.8366,4.8398,0.6178,4.868,0.0428,2.2465,3.547,5.173,0.1552,1.1176,2.9184,0.5339,2.6452,2.9756,2.6222,5.1018,0.1635,4.0331,2.4709,2.7402,5.358,2.9855,2.4001,2.8023,2.9763,0.1545,0.8157,1.1516,2.0946,3.2355,0.9297,2.6574,0.6802,0.0004,1.5893,6.2204,2.8626,4.4282,3.4471,0.2663,3.5572,0.019,0.1459,6.2889,0.1815,5.3249,5.4464,0.0012,1.5023,2.1325,0.8819,1.5138,0.3273,2.6685,2.5473,0.3492,3.0599,1.3009,4.3066,3.6889,5.8741,1.0302,1.7971,1.492,2.5225,0.852,5.2006,1.06,0.3621,0.2207,3.4189,3.0897,2.5946,0.8742,2.1756,2.7251,4.7052,5.0235,6.0462,8.5173,2.0603,1.603,6.7513,2.4433,5.3676,2.5877,0.7257,1.7484,1.2238,1.0991,2.1884,2.9617,0.6714,0.7251,0.9949,0.5241,0.3816,3.357,0.0021,2.0193,0.9033,2.6639,2.1801,6.9965,1.2511,0.2047,1.1751,4.6057,1.2439,2.9135,1.9357,1.24,3.0183,0.6668,1.7613,1.1467,3.3872,1.0989,2.4088,5.2322,1.0885,3.1929,0.678,1.1931,0.9228,2.5182,5.6842,4.4056,2.5298,0.3144,0.0017,3.9913,2.4539,1.4343,1.8469,2.8157,1.0302,1.5159,5.7527,3.3625,0.1794,0.3516,2.3228,1.4205,2.0317,5.5609,0.5158,0.1029,3.3707,3.3178,5.7015,2.3949,3.1051,5.2312,0.2139,3.2781,0.6766,4.9251,0.1748,1.0206,3.9223,4.283,3.9246,1.0944,1.2606,0.859,1.0844,1.5289,1.5618,3.2124,4.6452,2.2287,5.3326,4.394,7.3613,5.8881,2.0726,2.6897,0.1579,0.0014,2.0561,3.4788,6.7981,0.043,0.1642,4.2021,5.0195,0.0206,0.2931,3.3702,0.0245,1.5102,3.0839,5.1069,0.5748,0.2528,0.147,4.7751,4.5456,0.1087,5.4109,0.2923,6.5601,6.2842,1.5653,1.6151,0.5041,1.7507,7.155,1.9909,4.3399,1.3559,5.3498,0.1017,2.7018,3.7965,1.5614,4.4586,0.7612,5.8353,1.2334,4.3579,2.6378,2.2238,2.4905,7.5243,0.3046,0.2098,0.9509,4.2941,2.0561,0.1714,3.6182,7.5195,2.1224,4.1351,2.3754,1.4817,3.9187,1.3017,3.9067,0.5838,0.0033,1.665,3.374,4.5627,3.7207,8.3744,1.7045,1.5777,0.7979]}

Ryrie, who led the church where the Bible was first translated into English, Trump was asked about the charges against Flynn, who resigned from the White House in February after it was revealed that he and then national security adviser Dan Coats had discussed Flynn with Russian officials, potentially compromising the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nIn a statement, Flynn said the charges against him were unfounded, and he asked Trump to \u201crestore normalcy to the Office of the White House.\u201d\n\u201cOver these past three days, Mr. President, you have continuously insisted that you fired Director Comey,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cThese events are the worst scandal in my lifetime.\u201d\nIn a statement, the White House said Flynn had \u201cagreed to testify,\u201d but did not elaborate as to how he was agreeing to do so, and did not specify whether the meeting would take place next week.\n\u201cIt is important to note that this was not a joint White House meeting, not at the White House, not in the Oval Office.

This CPFB hearing is meant to explain to the public the actions of this agency. Elizabeth Warren is currently the senior member of the committee on banking and consumer finance. She is known for her activism, and is currently on the payroll. This appointment is one of the first signs that the CPFB is taking on a renewed role.\nThe CPFB has been criticized for its lack of accountability, and there were recent court battles involving this agency. Elizabeth Warren has recently met with the President himself regarding the actions of this agency, and she said that her department was doing a good job. In an interview with the Bloomberg article, Elizabeth Warren said that the CPFB is accountable to its leadership, and their duties are limited to the \u201c rule-making \u201d and \u201c enforcement \u201d. However, this doesn\u2019t mean the CPFB lacks accountability. In an interview with a CBS affiliate, Elizabeth Warren said that there cannot be a \u201c bureaucratic system of accountability, \u201d and the agency should still respond to the needs of the American. The American has not seen the effectiveness of any of these measures. The U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ), which also investigates financial crimes, has seen the failure of this agency. According to Bloomberg, Elizabeth Warren met with the CPFB president last week regarding possible changes to the staffing, and she said that staffing issues \u201c are probably the slowest problem any one agency has. \u201d Elizabeth Warren is known for her activism, and she used this experience to fight the \u201c toxic TARP. \u201d Elizabeth Warren has been called out by President Barack Obama, and she said in an interview that she could be wrong, and the president is right to say that this agency has had mistakes. She said that this agency has done \u201c great things, \u201d and that they\u2019re only working on mistakes.","token_len":421,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.3359,4.4373,0.0036,3.608,6.4559,0.3585,2.959,11.2526,3.8087,0.0125,1.2515,3.5136,5.8689,1.6502,0.4183,5.9107,0.208,0.0002,0.0021,2.1712,16.0327,4.6806,0.6312,1.7017,2.3375,4.0453,1.3596,0.265,1.007,8.8545,1.1937,0.3527,2.0087,2.4692,2.3564,0.0019,1.9401,7.1047,0.0244,0.9454,5.5289,11.4254,0.0058,5.7785,0.9976,5.7121,0.1427,6.0524,2.3465,1.551,1.4264,1.6608,4.5201,1.1636,5.529,0.8238,1.9902,5.1766,0.1324,1.5702,4.4771,1.8866,4.8955,3.1023,0.0971,0.2355,4.7399,1.9141,4.1678,1.6776,3.3959,3.1525,0.7975,2.1841,1.1074,5.2818,0.6225,0.3184,6.2627,4.0678,1.8772,2.495,3.0119,3.0599,0.7232,6.2214,5.1908,3.9305,6.7205,1.3942,4.4259,0.4164,0.6187,3.4954,5.8242,0.6232,1.3511,4.8807,0.024,0.7845,2.9401,2.1199,1.241,6.9289,1.9031,1.8321,1.5787,3.7179,3.5938,0.0173,1.7793,1.4848,2.9288,0.622,1.4456,2.4454,0.0021,3.2754,2.0075,1.1648,5.2571,3.8853,5.1763,7.0224,3.3801,3.6601,4.1742,0.3354,0.7359,3.2197,0.0373,1.287,4.8407,6.3599,0.0896,1.7901,4.8738,5.8121,4.4387,1.2565,4.4509,0.3405,1.4093,0.1358,1.4657,0.6055,1.6228,3.7847,1.1421,3.29,5.9497,3.1196,4.2537,1.5856,1.0648,0.0094,1.0882,3.7584,2.6339,0.4299,0.3784,1.8219,7.825,5.1278,0.5848,1.0724,0.0594,0.6534,0.4255,1.5781,3.2777,0.0101,1.7467,5.1083,1.3251,3.1792,6.5665,1.1512,0.5495,6.7957,6.5513,1.0287,4.9117,1.4306,2.4902,15.1416,7.8161,11.1784,3.3883,0.3011,5.7512,6.7896,2.6422,4.3281,0.3982,1.9179,2.0525,0.0825,1.096,3.7296,0.0206,2.9638,3.9889,10.7454,9.6341,0.249,0.2649,3.0014,2.4687,0.0052,6.2192,1.1539,0.5841,2.9393,2.7865,0.3959,0.1426,4.9365,5.3827,2.9725,0.7842,0.5741,0.0118,0.498,0.2578,3.8931,7.9887,0.0491,1.6339,5.709,0.5629,7.5311,2.6081,3.3021,1.7851,2.4376,5.8324,3.7187,1.2013,2.8923,2.4963,2.5119,7.0947,6.327,0.3166,1.7013,1.728,0.1449,1.0067,2.2849,9.5886,2.8644,5.1432,2.3739,3.8437,3.479,1.766,6.5963,0.1093,4.0273,1.1368,1.4586,3.9112,1.2265,2.4694,5.8758,0.0023,0.0025,0.004,2.8069,0.002,0.676,2.7042,2.4517,2.8156,2.3199,5.2337,4.6718,3.2694,0.8454,0.3544,1.0342,5.4093,2.2059,4.0937,0.3854,2.286,0.3408,1.5336,4.4772,0.0016,5.845,0.3878,3.3443,0.0039,4.8763,0.0505,1.0602,7.9101,0.0313,4.1531,3.5607,1.005,4.1846,6.5121,1.7217,0.4458,0.5463,7.9032,3.5404,0.9904,1.5818,0.9574,0.2204,9.3143,3.0427,7.6123,2.2953,1.9549,6.6347,1.9636,8.9444,0.0357,3.8635,6.3235,5.4254,0.2318,0.9901,1.7783,7.8103,2.9536,2.6301,0.0185,2.1384,4.5317,0.3248,0.3067,0.7508,0.3037,0.0806,1.2473,7.9593,2.7751,4.0928,0.2096,5.1819,2.6441,8.3302,0.2013,9.4571,8.3722,0.0108,2.8527,5.1431,0.3039,2.015,0.0247,1.4998,1.6781,4.503,2.7903,1.2421,4.6301,2.5346,0.004,2.7796,0.8071,1.5265,2.7749,3.5394,0.6366,0.0703,1.2112,1.051,4.9686,3.2312,5.505,2.0839,0.9668,2.9256,3.1654,2.0489,1.8915,1.458,2.6712,0.4453,2.9782,1.0584,1.8461,4.39,6.3738,0.9713,2.468,1.2246,0.2755,2.9652,0.5056,1.2883,3.7073,8.1652,0.4593,4.6796,1.8228,1.1826,2.4859,2.0964,0.7393,1.6519,2.7576,4.0617,1.1575,2.1165,5.9219,4.6895,1.729,8.1473,0.7019]}

{"prompt":"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres , warning against the danger of sleepwalking into war , said on Thursday that Security Council resolutions on North Korea s nuclear and missile programs must be fully implemented by Pyongyang","text":"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, warning against the danger of sleepwalking into war, said on Thursday that Security Council resolutions on North Korea s nuclear and missile programs must be fully implemented by Pyongyang and that the U.S. military must return to Japan a territory it has occupied since World War II. Trump has proposed that Japan share its costs for the defense of an already-strategically placed U.S. air base in Okinawa as compensation for the island s longstanding demand for more territory in the disputed East China Sea. At a meeting of the International Committee for the Red Cross s emergency committee in Geneva, Mr. Guterres addressed the growing risk of conflict between North Korea and the U.S. As a sign of his concern, he declared North Korea the worst state victim of war. North Korea s nuclear and missile programs threaten not only the security of Japan and the United States, he said, but of the entire region. Guterres said that Japan could not take refuge in its territorial sovereignty claims against North Korea because, as the Security Council Resolutions noted, the resolutions are designed to resolve a different matter, and the resolution s language of compliance with the demands of international norms applies equally to all countries regardless of the issues they are involved with. This week, Trump and Mr. Kim met twice at the historic summit in Vietnam, which opened the way for talks between Washington and Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump meet in Hanoi Friday June 30.

It is not clear if the president, whose campaign had declared that an agreement before Oct. 1 would allow him to use funds to build a border wall, will sign or veto the agreement.\nBut the U.S. has been pushing ahead even with no support on Capitol Hill, which began approving money for construction projects with the assumption that President Barack Obama would move ahead on a wall at his September deadline. Obama is set to announce his next action on the border Tuesday.\n\"This is something where, we have to recognize it, we're dealing with a political situation that doesn't seem to be going to end well for the government, if you want to call it a government,\" said Jim O'Donnell, a professor of American foreign policy at George Washington University. \"The President's personal preference, he will go to the wall.\"\nTillerson and Videgaray met on an ongoing security review of Mexico's cooperation, which took place amid intense criticism over security in the border region for the July 1 killing of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry and the subsequent release of images of the murder by a suspected gang member.\n\"We are going to put in place a comprehensive system that will bring an end to the violence,\" Tillerson said in a statement following the meeting.\nAt the time, the administration said that if Congress was prepared to provide additional funds for these projects it would also pass new border security legislation that would end a moratorium on construction, which allowed millions of dollars that could have made security upgrades elsewhere to be diverted for the border wall project.\nThe administration has been meeting with Congressional leaders for the past week to try to reach agreement on funding the border wall. But the talks have stalled and a compromise has not been reached.","token_len":424,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,3.1658,6.2069,0.0151,3.1984,7.817,4.5555,0.4426,10.075,4.4647,3.1163,2.069,1.7808,4.6852,7.0134,0.0141,0.0161,1.0448,0.331,0.0897,0.0168,5.7358,5.9147,2.022,0.0012,2.5513,0.8508,1.4585,7.3023,1.9887,2.8173,1.3671,0.2189,4.1677,0.1121,5.4261,4.0978,1.139,1.4007,4.4463,5.6273,1.7704,4.7986,5.2137,0.6952,4.765,5.9127,0.7538,0.2074,18.5765,0.0021,0.0022,0.0616,3.5423,0.0006,0.2158,0.0073,0.0013,3.2405,0.8486,2.4354,0.0087,0.8152,0.0001,0.0001,0.0001,7.5378,2.7183,4.3571,7.8038,4.1078,2.4799,5.1927,2.2538,3.0725,0.7039,1.4128,1.1723,4.232,4.646,3.987,3.4616,4.7606,7.1636,2.3858,5.7559,2.1351,6.7069,4.8457,0.0021,0.0689,0.9979,3.6491,2.4485,0.0852,4.2396,3.4869,1.4612,1.2998,0.6921,2.2176,0.0489,0.4608,1.1263,2.9724,4.2099,0.3974,0.54,2.8011,0.3223,0.2231,5.9526,1.9809,3.9349,0.0005,0.0026,0.2887,2.0777,2.1735,3.159,4.4963,6.4784,2.7204,5.8556,6.104,4.2377,1.9468,0.0005,1.2938,3.0062,6.5801,4.9933,3.6641,0.6768,3.2272,4.6865,4.2406,1.6967,7.366,0.3209,5.0089,2.925,0.0024,0.3101,6.209,2.4037,3.2662,2.2189,2.9601,4.9185,2.531,6.832,4.2574,0.2308,5.3807,3.4454,3.0154,0.0119,3.1157,1.4231,4.7277,5.1719,1.1378,1.3318,2.9755,4.1583,1.0872,0.1531,4.5012,2.3968,0.7943,4.1988,5.5465,4.5972,4.4953,2.7742,1.0712,5.1585,3.0444,2.3568,2.0738,2.5625,4.3356,0.0282,0.966,3.7252,2.4366,1.9974,4.3702,0.0003,3.5909,0.735,0.4375,2.2976,2.4605,5.0152,1.4244,1.6328,1.2824,5.2211,2.8328,5.8128,1.7044,3.7983,0.0831,1.5039,0.0938,1.8955,3.5321,0.7572,0.5573,4.8302,4.1625,0.0808,3.0675,0.0517,0.9687,3.7941,0.7603,4.3376,3.3403,0.1111,0.0854,2.2613,0.1582,0.0031,0.6801,1.1959,2.5444,4.5421,2.3059,7.4166,3.9567,2.6912,2.9508,3.9083,4.004,2.4031,1.1751,3.2541,2.1108,0.0339,5.0988,0.1641,0.0,1.9402,0.3079,0.0,0.0004,5.0789,2.7514,5.9378,6.2047,6.4396,3.3917,2.1181,4.0226,0.3867,6.0511,4.635,1.7669,4.2644,0.2695,4.466,3.8238,3.2416,2.9085,5.0891,3.0057,0.7345,2.826,1.3164,5.4169,2.2845,6.0887,3.503,4.1329,0.0275,2.0768,0.0022,1.4478,0.4176,0.0029,2.1301,1.3641,2.8588,3.5222,0.048,6.3672,0.5962,1.5197,5.7757,3.4139,1.8984,4.4639,2.4933,0.3364,0.7933,0.5527,2.6335,1.8557,2.3663,2.9398,0.0866,4.4035,2.6837,0.1975,0.8784,3.3162,3.8941,1.9011,1.6692,5.2924,4.5921,0.089,0.0015,1.265,1.7691,2.4688,0.7238,0.4081,1.9293,0.6133,1.0738,4.6888,0.2174,0.0799,0.3139,0.7301,5.2313,0.9226,1.6757,0.3062,1.8601,2.8485,1.5988,2.2845,4.1407,3.6524,4.6065,4.327,0.0718,5.048,4.0788,1.3827,1.1801,7.8385,0.7976,4.3622,0.3871,5.2592,4.8077,4.6517,3.0874,0.2614,0.7735,1.9618,0.3177,4.3613,2.8065,6.1247,0.0556,1.6919,3.5154,2.4189,6.0485,6.7015,0.0737,0.8952,5.5795,3.9627,0.4916,6.5149,6.8263,4.3848,7.1667,3.5134,1.728,4.2085,3.6078,2.1174,2.8648,0.3764,2.2009,0.1758,0.3191,2.1388,3.4894,1.8391,2.2312,5.6644,0.4641,5.2035,0.5773,2.5767,2.2623,0.3243,1.2258,1.2373,3.0357,0.0776,3.1668,2.6806,0.3037,2.7405,3.5577,2.5654,0.0379,1.1141,2.7349,1.8258,3.2124,0.7797,1.4558,2.9717,4.074,4.3507,1.3275,1.2405,0.6227,0.1397,0.5091]}

We have a very good relationship going on at the moment with Russia.\u2019\nTillerson would not elaborate on the two options but said that to achieve a level playing field, the US would \u2018 have to come up with a new approach \u2026 that is credible, honest and results-oriented, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything on this that fits that description.\u2019\n\u2018We know that the US intelligence community has determined that Russia has continued to interfere with elections in other countries, and that they have used various means to do so.\u2019","token_len":425,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,2.377,2.0935,2.0311,2.7916,3.4514,5.2054,4.1363,2.808,3.2229,4.6402,1.0782,1.0397,0.0724,4.8279,0.8589,3.401,4.242,3.0977,5.9914,18.1823,9.5811,9.3112,0.8414,6.7287,0.6428,6.4647,2.9181,5.8751,1.398,8.9457,7.4066,0.1856,3.3662,4.1487,0.6214,0.3308,15.5786,4.6222,8.8298,2.6399,6.6421,0.8031,4.176,2.5041,0.0781,3.4389,7.3195,1.7863,1.7324,5.0417,4.3798,0.5878,1.8709,8.2079,0.0936,6.0859,2.6507,0.6759,1.9498,0.2871,0.0008,0.0005,1.7941,5.6336,2.4892,4.4421,3.2584,3.3548,3.4313,0.1918,3.8601,3.6144,3.1735,5.1682,1.7955,5.597,2.4248,2.1724,1.173,1.2103,1.8276,4.136,6.6888,4.1847,0.1851,3.5565,4.8356,0.3212,3.2706,2.8839,7.1187,0.038,6.1471,5.4221,2.1851,0.6479,3.5786,0.6337,2.9931,2.6892,1.0057,3.2982,5.3472,1.3087,1.7755,0.87,2.5782,1.5696,2.5706,8.6747,0.6227,5.3941,6.3483,0.266,2.1658,0.7923,0.3449,4.6165,0.7305,2.966,0.5643,0.2656,6.0017,1.5281,0.0158,2.9378,4.4202,0.232,1.3092,3.0086,0.5397,4.9586,4.5187,3.7906,1.6612,0.3704,8.1702,0.0981,0.0012,6.4091,0.5351,5.4478,2.1721,5.0237,0.0414,3.6713,1.8894,0.733,1.9845,0.2021,4.0174,0.9664,3.681,2.2795,0.342,1.8632,4.5164,2.2375,1.7904,2.7614,1.9848,5.1938,6.0072,0.1123,2.6891,3.4602,2.281,8.3119,0.0697,3.4386,4.8881,2.0898,3.2515,1.565,1.0656,2.5,2.3861,3.6246,0.1879,1.9147,2.0091,0.6043,1.262,0.3167,4.5646,3.1195,1.668,1.2845,3.1805,1.3909,1.3631,1.6649,1.8802,0.4138,3.2821,0.355,1.0651,4.816,1.0177,1.9218,0.0009,0.0012,1.849,3.2387,3.4569,1.8133,4.0457,5.1219,2.1652,10.6831,0.0202,0.2716,0.8326,0.3344,5.4557,2.8732,0.9402,4.2879,5.0705,3.3791,7.3003,5.3304,0.0105,0.0695,2.9554,2.5065,0.4549,0.2237,0.2463,3.3531,1.7181,4.3099,3.9224,1.6091,0.9264,3.2097,1.283,5.7422,0.0007,0.9596,4.5745,0.0016,0.7977,2.9027,0.5799,0.2115,1.9836,6.9129,0.0149,0.1125,2.9463,2.7009,0.0045,0.2397,12.2345,8.0915,6.9727,0.0031,0.7944,2.4505,4.5083,2.0978,3.0583,2.5733,0.7611,4.4921,4.9846,6.8575,9.541,0.324,3.8251,2.9091,0.5681,1.2292,0.0993,2.5321,3.4171,3.4215,3.3947,0.2407,10.081,7.7252,2.5417,1.5438,0.7596,3.5546,0.9004,2.0647,0.996,2.0683,6.5883,2.1913,2.2552,0.1631,1.7052,0.9956,1.9038,2.0253,2.3491,2.7332,1.2837,0.2097,6.8891,1.7135,4.6769,0.9492,1.8566,1.0692,1.0818,0.9789,2.5177,0.1192,0.25,4.7085,0.4866,0.0,5.9181,0.2285,2.9644,0.3222,1.3454,3.552,2.3711,2.6508,0.8436,1.4627,6.2644,3.716,2.3039,4.8411,1.5853,0.0026,0.8147,1.7579,0.6099,1.3552,12.0114,3.369,4.5636,0.0385,5.3474,0.2982,0.0181,0.8539,3.0968,2.1664,8.3727,2.0726,1.9973,5.9303,1.5552,5.8564,0.4582,6.902,0.8006,0.1073,1.9561,1.5519,4.2026,3.2558,3.151,0.3534,0.0056,0.6633,1.9055,5.1939,0.0949,2.0433,1.9927,2.9652,5.0236,2.4049,3.4107,5.9647,1.5608,2.6028,0.3277,2.3962,0.1474,0.1402,1.5011,0.0745,1.368,5.0173,1.057,2.0735,1.9933,6.6726,0.09,1.589,4.2373,0.1812,1.0512,2.0503,5.5511,0.2632,4.9231,1.8672,3.9852,0.7778,4.0875,0.1635,1.2325,1.3619,1.3044,2.7708,1.0437,3.0677,4.5228,1.4077,0.529,2.7193,0.8809,0.5349,0.7531,0.0262]}

The deficit is due, mostly, to the Palestinian Authority's inability to raise taxes on Palestinians.\nThe Arab League will discuss the issue at a meeting on Saturday, according to a statement issued late Friday in the United Nations Security Council, the body that coordinates peace efforts in the Middle East.\nThe meeting comes as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is in a European Union country for business trips that have raised speculation he may end his stint as the sole spokesman for the Palestinians, who have been unable to reach an agreement with Israel since they disarmed the PLO and Hamas in a two-state solution.","token_len":427,"entropy":[8.6718,2.2109,8.2097,2.5789,4.3348,6.1775,7.0367,0.673,2.6034,4.0533,2.7328,1.1388,2.9595,1.7974,1.0608,6.823,0.4383,0.8266,2.3064,5.5859,5.7024,0.2508,0.1266,5.4561,0.0033,6.6038,0.315,1.8316,0.5822,9.829,0.0051,0.6552,8.2095,0.0044,0.0138,0.0074,4.937,3.191,0.7598,4.591,2.2122,3.48,2.918,3.2052,0.1664,0.7306,3.2404,1.6217,1.2463,1.7173,5.3084,2.1786,5.1306,1.7563,4.1943,1.594,3.1811,3.5736,3.8863,1.5109,2.6703,0.5336,0.4802,2.1056,4.0501,0.9951,1.2257,2.8628,3.1875,1.2458,0.6113,2.9655,0.0305,1.808,2.5879,0.8839,3.3607,1.1269,0.3118,1.0646,2.8385,0.7834,5.0835,3.2932,3.9869,3.2961,1.622,1.8218,3.8925,8.2497,4.7539,1.217,3.7111,1.2168,5.4413,2.8013,2.7194,3.3042,2.3097,0.3256,1.1594,2.1929,13.0141,4.3547,0.1057,0.0,0.0001,3.6999,5.1012,2.9036,3.6051,0.0066,1.3133,7.947,4.8168,0.3812,4.8845,6.1911,0.0503,7.0566,0.1438,9.1257,0.3888,5.2304,2.1486,3.5115,3.9013,3.8559,3.4675,4.6417,0.2274,7.4682,0.0322,0.1702,2.7845,2.0452,2.2058,5.6718,9.4232,0.4661,3.0093,0.5385,0.1606,1.867,6.5837,6.6013,4.9578,4.4527,3.2042,6.0304,3.6157,4.2902,2.6785,2.7155,0.4821,1.1025,2.2855,2.9091,0.3281,3.8383,0.18,2.6839,1.9159,0.0053,0.4991,2.4306,1.0954,6.5535,1.8765,0.8491,3.0629,3.6646,3.3042,2.3462,1.2204,8.5094,1.9101,2.6898,1.6673,4.4416,2.7545,6.2115,0.4621,0.7328,0.4533,1.3374,2.9403,0.458,0.6105,1.2404,1.1008,3.2624,0.5721,3.1784,2.1358,6.5037,1.7939,6.0674,3.417,1.4377,2.6723,3.3836,1.0368,2.0145,0.8218,0.9123,1.6115,5.4068,0.5717,0.9093,9.4265,0.2877,1.4384,6.5615,1.3172,2.3014,3.895,3.9608,3.4863,6.2769,0.3297,0.52,4.5293,0.7858,4.0109,0.0701,0.0137,4.7204,3.3012,0.0214,1.0938,3.5726,1.8703,0.552,5.2645,5.0232,1.8167,1.644,2.488,3.5064,5.6081,0.0484,1.0149,0.1116,0.2236,0.7548,0.3466,3.6508,1.5197,8.3514,4.0151,4.0611,2.8548,1.8048,0.4442,0.2516,0.0223,6.113,0.7193,2.597,0.4369,3.4307,2.0956,0.0021,1.2857,3.9739,0.0378,5.6232,1.6569,4.3095,1.6023,7.1717,0.049,1.2843,3.0966,6.3495,0.4321,1.0537,5.5423,1.0975,5.5021,0.6372,1.2186,2.2432,7.191,0.4945,1.0778,1.1008,0.0613,4.737,4.468,4.1217,3.9584,7.0786,1.9306,0.985,2.5695,0.2893,2.5971,0.5071,3.0751,0.735,0.1836,0.0021,4.4381,1.3785,1.9545,5.0177,1.3999,3.2813,5.7255,6.8032,0.2421,0.0141,1.7018,3.7408,0.311,0.2364,2.9077,0.0041,3.6408,3.1576,1.4026,4.9695,2.4516,0.5015,1.8285,5.7579,0.5763,5.2508,3.9543,1.0866,1.9113,1.7685,0.8645,0.6767,2.3169,2.8295,1.6123,2.4007,0.0027,1.3146,2.5946,2.0452,3.7497,0.6028,4.4086,2.2196,4.6991,1.6086,3.4586,0.0008,2.4617,3.251,3.5492,0.824,5.839,3.4362,1.3994,1.5386,0.0993,0.4854,0.0014,0.1866,0.5448,1.5451,4.9906,2.7756,1.4566,2.3202,1.0094,0.6514,0.0029,0.0,2.4831,3.3434,3.88,6.1493,1.5873,6.4238,2.0805,6.0135,8.5497,3.6088,2.9003,2.347,4.3677,3.4743,1.5656,4.6639,1.9995,6.8621,0.6501,2.8009,4.3007,7.3837,0.1457,0.7448,2.4057,2.8556,2.5508,1.2886,1.587,3.5574,0.0156,2.4923,1.5803,0.0757,1.5854,1.2306,4.0426,4.3261,8.2309,0.7989,1.1045,5.8256,0.0026,3.4516,2.5349,0.9464,1.7599,3.9391,0.0044,0.9992,0.188,2.1493]}
{"prompt":"Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday ruled out calling a national election after Catalan separatists won a regional vote , thwarting his bid to resolve the country s biggest political crisis in decades .","text":"Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday ruled out calling a national election after Catalan separatists won a regional vote, thwarting his bid to resolve the country s biggest political crisis in decades. The vote, which separatists insist may be legally binding, would have seen a return to the pre-Brexit era when Catalan was allowed to decide its own fate. But Mr Rajoy responded that it was a move that would cause more harm than any good. He added that separatism in this context was not a solution, and promised no one would win. EU leaders will meet on Friday to thrash out a deal to end the crisis. It is expected to spell out that Catalan independence would be unlawful. The Catalan leaders were elected on September 25 last year to lead Catalonia in a new administration designed to replace the one that was overthrown after the December 2015 coup attempt to topple Mr Rajoy. Mr Puigdemont, the outgoing president, fled Spain after the coup and was later declared an international fugitive. He took refuge in Belgium and was declared a flight risk by the European Union s travel ban lists. The separatists, meanwhile, launched one of their own coup attempts last month by calling a general strike to protest at Mr Rajoy s refusal to discuss a Catalan constitution. The strike was a stunning reversal by Catalan separatists, who are seen as a strong voting bloc in the region s assembly. Barcelona is set to become a major staging ground for the political crisis, with Mr Rajoy set to deliver a speech to a centralized national television as the Catalan separatists begin a show of force in Barcelona. Independentist protests are expected, along with mass demonstrations in the Catalan capital. The Catalan Parliament, which will not be reconvened until Wednesday later, had been set to start a discussion of a new constitution but that has now been called off.

{"prompt":"Thousands of impoverished Venezuelans are crossing the border to Colombia every day to sell cheap basics , from oranges to candles , in a desperate attempt to earn hard currency amid their country s worsening","text":"Thousands of impoverished Venezuelans are crossing the border to Colombia every day to sell cheap basics, from oranges to candles, in a desperate attempt to earn hard currency amid their country s worsening economic crisis at home, sources and officials said on Monday.\nIn 2014, almost two million Venezuelans left their land as a result of the economic crisis. In the past year, some of them have traveled back. Many of these immigrants said they do not have passports or IDs for documents.\nVenezuela, in the south of South America, has a population of 24.8 million people - its fifth-largest - and is run by Maduro, who is recognized as his homeland by more than 50 other countries.\nMost of the country\u2019s income falls from oil revenues. But the United States, the world s largest oil producer in the world, has cut oil payments to Venezuela and has blacklisted several top officials of that country for corruption.\nPresident Maduro has responded by increasing the prices of some basic goods, fuel and some foodstuffs, accusing the US of destroying the public finances in Venezuela through various actions.\nWith more than half of its population under the age of 15, Venezuela has for a long time suffered its deepest crisis in decades. Its economy has collapsed. The average salary is about $60 per month.\nHundreds of thousands of the population - mainly those who are retired or unemployed - live on minimum wages, barely keeping the lights on.\nThe country is suffering shortages due to a collapse of the basic industrial sector and the rise in demand from the Venezuelan government for oil products. The oil trade crisis resulted in some import bans of the products, which were in short supply.\nMore than 2.4 million Venezuelans have left the country as of January 2019, according to data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and more than 1 million have crossed the border into Colombia and then into Ecuador and Peru.\nThe IOM said more than 350,000 Venezuelans have settled abroad, mainly in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Almost 1,100,000 Venezuelans left the country since 2014.","token_len":427,"entropy":[2.241,7.6341,4.8857,0.0023,2.02,6.8412,0.6477,0.1955,2.3771,4.0588,4.0927,0.1902,1.6961,5.5856,6.3572,8.2822,1.8831,4.8816,6.0544,0.2536,6.7437,1.0957,3.9385,1.6681,1.3026,1.2175,0.0078,4.2151,7.0152,0.1854,6.8657,5.8469,2.5037,9.3645,10.9699,0.3604,0.4497,7.7545,0.8095,2.9206,6.0412,4.6191,2.753,0.6801,2.258,1.9025,0.0664,0.1915,15.7531,6.4411,0.2441,5.0087,3.8684,0.9653,0.5911,0.0022,3.9628,1.4128,4.6047,5.6565,2.0368,0.323,0.0101,1.1978,2.5717,0.4987,1.9738,3.3748,2.2049,1.4826,1.2293,0.3315,3.7636,3.6211,0.9293,0.482,3.4911,3.4612,4.6907,4.7171,2.2017,3.2951,5.4863,5.979,0.227,5.0238,0.0575,1.9653,6.5889,1.4545,5.3323,4.0294,7.219,2.9808,0.3453,4.2365,0.0047,0.6916,3.3796,3.9664,2.1618,4.2293,0.7409,6.9995,0.0322,0.2041,0.9351,2.763,3.1975,0.1069,6.3949,2.4003,2.4258,0.0191,1.8086,5.5547,5.6536,5.1613,0.497,0.0969,4.8196,0.737,2.277,6.4011,0.134,5.1548,1.7612,1.4431,1.8223,8.3511,1.2374,5.6467,8.1727,1.3217,5.7141,0.011,3.224,4.4588,0.6286,0.3593,0.5318,5.3229,0.7163,0.3747,3.4516,15.7886,7.6427,4.5474,6.4513,6.3234,4.1473,4.8012,1.8347,3.0767,3.0772,1.9853,5.5548,0.2563,1.5866,2.6094,0.8028,11.0446,2.8452,1.2741,1.3895,4.7644,1.4395,0.6966,0.1861,1.4893,3.313,3.4925,6.4626,0.9025,0.7339,2.4725,1.9831,10.0324,0.0386,3.7084,5.4557,1.6544,4.5504,4.309,0.2424,2.6698,3.0974,0.7974,0.4351,5.2749,2.3313,1.4548,5.8898,0.625,4.5924,1.5317,5.7816,0.1726,4.2634,2.9718,1.1146,1.1942,9.8723,0.5104,5.7517,2.5612,2.7724,0.0001,1.4262,6.3121,1.2954,3.7166,0.4397,7.0899,1.0844,7.1535,2.973,3.3541,1.7581,4.2771,7.2035,3.9273,1.3383,0.4543,5.2662,3.7875,0.1634,3.2921,0.3953,5.1694,1.9583,2.9706,1.7982,0.2082,0.0022,4.6798,0.3056,0.6624,1.4855,7.089,4.1049,0.3885,0.0145,4.2492,5.8142,6.0689,3.2599,1.7216,0.8768,0.4303,4.2451,1.31,1.087,3.0091,3.6052,2.1411,5.2652,4.6257,3.1232,2.2464,0.4065,3.8428,2.9664,0.5105,1.0745,0.7491,6.3428,0.1402,0.3386,0.3419,5.6975,3.9543,4.6479,4.0365,4.5512,2.056,1.9269,8.3714,1.0305,3.4124,0.273,2.8316,2.1202,6.3074,1.8414,1.4415,5.9072,5.7394,2.936,6.3593,0.0987,1.1432,1.0887,2.2225,2.8162,1.5635,3.4232,5.068,6.6378,0.0856,1.9221,6.1385,1.8736,1.4928,5.2527,5.3849,2.3293,1.7836,1.7967,5.023,1.3183,5.9835,1.7736,2.25,4.9683,2.6457,2.1171,2.8174,4.0866,0.66,2.3082,4.7521,4.6197,8.8622,6.3363,0.0744,4.5307,8.172,3.4551,4.4314,3.103,3.8221,1.5819,1.7218,2.7101,4.7276,2.2894,0.0005,1.2445,0.4457,5.3904,0.1034,3.2625,1.5396,2.1721,0.0348,0.9527,0.0028,1.5921,3.0419,1.1086,0.0536,3.5008,1.0161,2.4686,7.9876,0.6535,1.5419,0.0008,3.6216,0.7503,0.3751,2.8927,2.2402,0.1737,0.002,2.8024,0.03,0.0029,1.7301,2.4665,2.1135,0.0511,2.4087,1.2299,1.253,4.288,0.5115,0.1131,2.4182,0.0756,4.0356,4.9892,2.3173,4.6641,3.2593,2.6228,0.6617,0.5161,1.8055,4.2231,0.0023,1.2156,3.424,0.0136,5.7362,0.2034,0.0015,1.1652,0.0048,1.3058,6.6083,4.946,2.4132,3.2256,0.5971,2.6593,1.0469,2.5398,0.3176,0.2016,0.6683,5.9413,2.8382,1.4383,3.4471,3.131,0.0041,1.372,0.0077,4.0856,1.3279,0.0787,4.286,3.4753,0.9537]}
{"prompt":"The chairman of the U.S. Senate health committee on Tuesday urged U.S. President Donald Trump to drop his threat to cut government subsidy payments to insurers that make Obamacare plans affordable and allow the payments","text":"The chairman of the U.S. Senate health committee on Tuesday urged U.S. President Donald Trump to drop his threat to cut government subsidy payments to insurers that make Obamacare plans affordable and allow the payments, known as buy-in payments, to lapse.\nThe move comes amid a White House push to eliminate the program, which is under a federal government contract with the federal marketplace and could be subject to cancellation should Congress fail to act.\nU.S. senator Patty Murray has made three separate written recommendations she said should be considered if Trump goes ahead with threatening to pull the buy-in payments.\n\"If Congress fails to act and the government cancels the Federal Health Options Program, insurers will have nowhere to turn to to cover their clients' medical costs,\" Murray wrote.\n\"This is unacceptable.\"\nU.S. Sen. Patty Murray calls for #Trump to rescind his threat to cancel the buy-in payments made to insurers, which could be triggered with government shutdown.\nWe have no room for this. https:\/\/t.co\/6nHvPJ7vzN\n\u2014 Health & Human Services (@HHS) February 4, 2018\nTrump's threat has left insurers \u2014 and consumers \u2014 looking for ways to provide affordable coverage to those who make less money. The president has also said he would sign a bill that would remove federal subsidies for many of the policies.\nThe Senate voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act last year and then put it back on the table after a court order temporarily blocked a repeal before it went into effect. It has been a priority since then for Democrats and Republicans but some leaders in Congress say they fear cancelling the program with this budget bill would create a hardship in the economy that could not be alleviated by other legislation.\nTrump has previously said the plan in the budget bill \"feeds money into those who do not really want to have an insurance plan.\"\n\"With the Affordable Care Act, it was a huge win. I had to win \u2014 you know, I'm president.

I m not aware","text":"The White House said on Thursday it was not aware of any other country that planned to follow President Donald Trump s lead and recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. I m not aware of anybody on other countries and countries didn t say they would recognize it, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Thursday. The move by Trump came less than 48 hours after Trump gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos that said the United States was rebuilding Israel as a Jewish state, breaking decades of U.N. recognition of the city as the capital of the Palestinian state. Trump s executive order does not acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel s capital or state of Israel, but says the White House recognizes only the U.S. Embassy as its official representative in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is disputed by Israel and Palestine, but Israel recognizes the area as its capital.\nDo you like to play blackjack but often find you get a little cheeky and wind up losing to the house on a few counts of blackjack?\nIf this sounds like you then I have a secret weapon to prevent you from losing to the house on any more blackjack and that is to simply avoid playing a single hand blackjack.\nBy following a simple strategy that I have set you can beat the house in games of blackjack, and do so for a much higher payout. A lot of people would say that a strategy like that is impossible and you would be right to say that.\nI will start by stating that I am no psychic and cannot promise anything either good or bad will come your way. If you follow the advice below I can guarantee you that you will get a payout in the majority of games of blackjack that you participate in however I have no power over what game you play and what other players that come to them are playing and of course the house rules at any given Blackjack table.\nBlackjack can be very frustrating for a gambler and you can get pulled deep into playing it and losing time and money because of simple mistakes that people make during play. I will give you a quick reminder as to what you can do to beat the house.","token_len":429,"entropy":[7.2138,0.1791,2.2959,2.4778,1.8189,1.3822,1.4835,3.4222,1.3152,0.06,0.5156,4.3055,7.5728,1.6689,7.4714,0.1118,5.0343,4.026,1.2095,0.0066,11.6015,1.301,2.8041,7.6751,1.3084,0.0368,1.9917,11.2658,0.0102,0.3578,9.2313,7.2569,3.1463,1.2604,0.1672,6.6697,5.0064,5.4525,1.7547,5.3334,3.6361,8.1628,1.2834,4.7173,2.4165,0.7093,1.8195,2.0557,2.102,8.8571,0.0011,1.7876,0.0186,0.5832,1.6397,1.8956,0.0927,2.6248,0.8025,0.4098,3.1067,3.3337,2.7289,2.3414,4.3618,3.9408,0.0067,3.3552,0.0101,0.0972,4.1791,5.6856,0.8411,0.4371,1.8562,0.5409,4.5179,0.1522,0.0008,0.2686,0.013,0.0002,3.7959,3.3936,1.4326,0.7145,0.0044,2.3559,8.9588,4.6999,3.9323,1.1246,1.5131,0.2434,2.1844,7.4668,4.7351,0.0368,2.803,0.0086,4.4752,0.1647,5.5704,0.9461,1.1688,2.1296,1.6698,1.2884,0.1514,0.3091,2.0484,3.8825,0.8406,0.3686,2.3297,7.4224,6.2374,0.092,4.7184,0.0456,5.6687,0.2717,0.3047,0.4366,0.4825,0.0347,5.1258,4.3769,4.1313,0.6461,1.5994,1.2404,3.8309,1.6582,4.6074,0.0017,4.1137,7.1699,1.9128,5.5757,0.0051,0.1227,0.3554,3.7689,4.1163,2.5137,3.2571,4.8564,0.794,0.9904,0.4871,6.0568,0.9266,7.3743,0.1512,1.1681,0.7715,4.5343,1.395,2.5089,3.0583,5.1225,1.2303,5.1607,0.5058,1.6015,0.3077,0.7192,2.2974,12.7607,1.4841,4.9969,3.2603,4.5331,7.3879,0.6788,5.2009,7.6451,3.4801,2.8055,4.2627,2.9166,2.2466,8.6249,0.0328,3.2128,7.3647,0.2595,4.0721,3.8204,2.4343,8.0195,4.1288,3.6078,6.5532,6.1765,4.4398,4.0002,0.0148,0.5071,1.939,4.6286,4.6763,3.4443,0.6868,1.6612,5.9328,2.3728,3.0057,1.544,6.1681,4.0957,2.4291,5.4353,0.4914,0.2918,5.0345,1.9553,1.1955,0.2459,0.55,4.7672,4.8524,3.7695,0.0131,3.8554,3.4329,0.409,1.9098,5.8926,5.0327,3.1439,3.8831,5.6141,4.1995,4.3358,0.0232,1.0135,1.4763,6.3587,6.5522,3.674,3.0831,3.8556,2.5253,2.9387,1.5388,5.2718,7.7814,5.3649,4.4777,2.0205,0.633,2.8571,6.166,1.3168,1.0727,0.0052,2.181,2.9971,6.119,1.8361,3.6288,2.5724,4.6774,3.0504,4.2386,0.9529,4.9471,3.3748,0.1971,0.9378,4.1597,2.2855,1.1737,3.8408,5.4315,1.0643,1.8688,1.0,4.0533,2.46,3.299,2.362,1.3587,2.3574,3.5911,1.1835,0.9128,1.1352,1.2143,2.6183,3.5436,5.0073,1.1766,2.8185,0.4456,1.2183,1.11,4.2922,8.6293,2.1092,3.6911,7.0112,2.52,8.3311,7.6392,0.0615,0.0979,5.8828,0.6762,5.2715,0.0018,0.9475,3.8505,0.5591,4.5309,1.6501,3.7574,3.2029,2.0019,3.3567,1.7774,0.5788,0.7982,1.3887,0.2602,3.0271,1.6696,5.1868,2.6341,1.9261,7.9677,0.0633,1.3103,1.0762,0.1414,0.0011,2.5205,1.0646,5.1301,0.061,8.6088,3.7303,2.114,2.9044,5.552,1.4627,3.1858,4.4733,0.5359,0.5472,2.5708,2.9356,5.5009,2.4451,5.0076,4.8915,1.849,7.5386,3.057,1.4389,3.4717,6.4735,0.1331,3.2202,4.5175,4.8537,5.52,3.4681,0.4579,9.2332,0.0079,1.9239,1.1106,0.7317,3.5499,0.0173,5.2478,0.4015,3.6508,4.0384,1.9868,2.6673,6.9174,0.0003,1.8696,3.3977,1.9874,3.1166,6.7962,7.4352,0.153,5.0514,4.029,2.3035,3.9942,6.8285,2.1884,0.8941,4.0432,1.3358,8.8196,2.1192,2.0892,4.5774,0.2396,4.5894,2.2909,0.4932,2.5373,2.0739,3.0407,0.3455,1.042,2.4752,5.3202,4.0757,0.7797,1.3924,2.5028,1.4471,0.7253,1.2371,5.0188,1.1621,0.171,2.1107]}

( )\nSo the question to be asked is: Does it make sense at all to hold people accountable for such contributions?\nAnd yet, Herring has been criticized this election cycle for working with Frances Broaddus-Crutchfield against a pro-life judge ( by voting to nullify the election of the judge ) \u2014 the first judge in Virginia to be elected in a campaign in which the candidate wasn\u2019t receiving contributions or lobbying and had voted in the past on pro-life issues and opposed abortion.\nBut it was the American Bar Association that was responsible for helping Sanford\u2019s campaign get his campaign off the ground.","token_len":429,"entropy":[5.5526,1.2209,0.3849,9.7331,8.5339,4.1197,2.3194,5.0512,6.7818,5.1721,0.0776,1.2792,8.0359,0.0169,5.4369,7.0777,13.4736,0.6982,1.6302,5.7294,0.2831,6.1563,14.8986,8.1543,8.6394,3.3041,5.7616,0.0081,2.8037,0.1591,0.0129,1.1634,4.0819,5.3884,1.165,0.2384,2.1869,11.4623,0.9299,4.7249,5.1919,3.1572,2.4023,6.3273,3.5563,4.0497,8.2171,0.3939,0.3902,6.6467,0.0132,0.0004,0.6728,5.5437,1.8718,3.6738,0.5427,1.0553,2.3792,4.6186,0.0004,0.0095,0.1166,0.0035,0.0028,0.0003,4.9691,0.372,3.5138,5.2549,7.9674,0.0016,6.86,0.0182,0.0041,1.9779,1.6372,3.7645,3.2412,4.3701,1.3592,3.7876,0.9989,3.785,5.9841,1.6281,2.5303,3.0555,3.0995,2.9111,0.4533,4.5972,1.5019,1.2266,6.6498,1.4557,1.126,4.3634,0.002,3.4311,0.3322,5.0929,7.0128,2.0999,8.4787,4.0906,0.5145,0.5107,0.1879,6.9476,1.2259,0.0078,0.0158,0.1137,0.0406,0.0018,0.0006,2.2828,1.5739,6.3846,1.4426,2.2294,1.5867,1.08,4.4291,2.7546,0.9744,1.7746,0.0283,0.3916,9.5639,1.9232,1.3751,5.1335,2.6259,4.3004,0.8837,2.3646,2.7838,1.0928,0.001,0.0048,0.0058,0.008,0.0022,0.0006,2.3971,1.3594,2.3066,0.3367,2.533,2.2077,3.3014,0.0039,6.4158,4.7811,1.7392,4.9598,1.0501,0.0747,7.0256,8.6095,2.2354,1.9206,2.7603,5.0348,0.1627,3.7628,2.0418,4.8233,0.7689,4.8937,3.8118,0.0035,3.3797,0.8196,0.0372,0.0035,4.335,6.7882,9.9644,0.6175,1.7424,2.9813,0.2054,4.1384,0.5862,4.2736,1.5674,4.8418,2.5537,0.858,2.6656,0.6025,1.4738,3.7384,4.1423,5.1963,11.5048,5.263,9.809,1.9164,5.3991,5.0575,7.123,3.6097,6.2219,0.4507,7.7648,5.3454,5.5688,2.4481,2.5065,0.5442,0.0035,0.0026,0.0297,0.0405,0.0042,0.0008,0.4546,1.2336,2.3812,5.1819,0.1096,1.7399,3.9846,0.4574,2.9198,2.3536,0.0296,4.4987,2.212,0.9968,0.7267,0.037,4.2543,0.5157,2.2351,4.4833,0.3182,4.4604,0.0634,0.3856,0.6994,2.4854,5.1695,2.8136,0.209,2.7762,0.002,2.1537,1.0917,4.9117,1.7163,0.8378,4.7752,0.0913,0.0358,0.376,1.2078,3.2063,0.4249,2.7964,0.0945,5.7231,0.7985,0.2867,2.4687,0.0022,0.069,0.2014,0.3784,2.6287,5.1062,0.015,0.3895,6.0454,2.304,6.3026,0.2482,3.1047,4.2797,0.0955,2.2318,3.3041,5.6223,5.1525,1.8994,7.3583,0.2012,1.2342,5.0094,5.8579,1.1019,0.1328,6.8516,1.53,2.5502,0.5152,0.1264,4.1159,3.1739,4.0749,5.1342,2.7703,0.2086,0.965,1.3999,3.9178,3.4298,1.6244,0.6876,6.7667,0.1822,0.9814,6.1091,5.5444,0.5054,0.4925,5.4937,4.0176,1.2688,0.8197,4.2158,5.0758,0.5381,6.0939,0.0062,2.019,2.0668,3.0999,6.6895,0.73,0.0661,0.3019,6.6169,1.7594,2.2317,0.572,0.0051,0.0027,0.0034,0.008,0.003,0.0008,7.5318,3.0703,1.5938,0.01,0.5187,1.2624,4.241,8.0647,4.6074,0.6443,4.5717,0.0044,0.79,2.35,0.3664,1.6525,1.401,1.9918,2.6031,4.0287,3.4119,5.7733,2.046,1.1843,1.4828,1.9407,3.6714,2.7733,2.0268,5.7635,3.7809,2.3228,1.6754,2.4987,5.7992,4.0474,1.8882,8.9508,6.7482,3.7984,5.0812,5.7311,5.5999,3.2868,5.5169,2.3849,2.4226,2.6798,3.9581,2.4058,0.0187,0.1042,0.2158,4.5936,4.4065,1.1417,1.3652,0.6033,3.2311,3.2487,3.461,2.4488,6.614,0.0931,0.0073,1.1449,3.1182,2.9211,0.1164,4.0608,4.834,8.5915,0.0182,2.2403,0.4257,3.3185,5.4571,0.761,0.1523,0.0254,0.0076,0.7759]}

This would be a very dangerous choice,\u201d Yergin told Business Insider.\nEven if Trump were to withdraw, he would have to find a new ally within the U.S. government to back him up in his attempt to pull the plug and have U.S. officials confirm that they would do so.\nBut that would be a huge ask from Trump, who is already unpopular with many of his allies in the GOP. The White House seems unlikely to abandon NAFTA, Yergin said.\nEven if Trump does leave NAFTA, he would still find it hard to bring the trade agreement to a swift end. The U.S. government still has to find a new agreement with Canada and Mexico, and there is a long process before any new trade pact could come to fruition.\nThe first phase would be getting the U.S. Congress to accept the agreement and allow it to be ratified by each country's parliaments. Once that happens, the next phase would be a diplomatic resolution to allow for formal negotiations.","token_len":430,"entropy":[12.7092,4.7017,8.9001,5.941,7.6469,0.0004,0.4906,3.6355,0.0066,0.0203,0.0384,2.4767,0.1894,0.0067,5.059,1.7178,4.847,0.0989,7.6865,1.3508,1.8965,4.5174,0.8751,2.6214,0.5864,0.1636,2.778,1.0059,1.8352,2.6797,8.8749,0.3014,0.5742,3.9843,0.5393,3.7247,1.9321,1.5436,4.5376,2.5166,3.0341,0.8719,1.5638,0.0074,0.6129,0.5754,22.0881,2.7893,5.0859,0.9361,5.8417,1.3043,4.3007,0.8144,5.1613,1.589,1.6022,3.6069,2.8098,2.9424,2.0609,5.6343,1.8137,1.9606,0.4884,5.8242,2.6464,1.0372,2.0572,2.3101,4.8515,0.0017,0.1373,3.5599,3.3224,3.5503,17.2011,7.7596,2.3021,8.0317,1.033,0.4583,0.5069,6.993,5.5662,3.8522,3.0589,1.7009,1.1806,2.2032,3.2079,3.3091,0.0003,0.0605,0.2524,6.415,0.1229,2.7931,3.3132,0.032,0.6171,3.2756,4.4104,0.512,2.8881,5.2979,3.294,0.6498,4.3009,0.1337,0.8009,0.2937,12.298,4.6291,9.157,3.4973,4.2034,1.7103,4.0959,5.016,1.3992,4.4294,5.3075,0.6395,2.4755,4.9829,2.7095,3.2157,4.4511,2.4608,1.4595,1.7069,0.118,0.6398,2.3735,4.357,5.7867,2.1401,0.4779,1.2138,0.0003,0.0006,0.6779,3.3497,5.8268,3.7198,4.056,2.9473,5.8812,1.6934,2.0137,1.1715,2.3679,2.1923,0.0036,1.8559,3.4418,7.9543,6.44,7.4464,6.1417,1.3779,0.3974,0.2707,1.1318,6.9274,2.9176,9.0687,6.2359,4.5887,0.6379,1.3301,0.0015,1.5764,4.9963,1.8852,1.2069,2.2877,0.0003,0.0066,0.0009,1.6282,3.1207,4.2136,1.1551,1.3008,0.398,0.3165,3.2548,0.6492,3.3384,6.7201,3.9909,3.2771,3.0909,5.4248,2.8807,2.8473,0.9835,0.933,0.4011,4.0503,0.7564,1.8497,1.3135,4.5068,7.7441,4.6499,0.405,2.1335,5.1183,0.2636,5.0747,2.7424,10.1933,4.5931,3.9221,0.249,1.7318,4.2291,3.141,1.1642,1.1156,1.7762,4.3351,6.4081,2.0844,2.7382,1.3056,0.6092,0.0015,0.0009,2.8212,0.0686,0.0003,0.1963,0.2774,4.873,0.6407,1.3114,3.0241,0.1786,0.4765,1.082,1.6473,0.8902,2.0489,0.4834,4.0983,0.9091,3.4848,4.2563,3.8777,0.4682,1.7033,0.0005,0.0027,0.3023,2.098,1.5133,4.2001,0.619,0.3094,3.135,2.7585,3.5319,0.0155,3.3102,0.9583,3.1519,4.7645,6.2762,4.8369,0.0004,0.0019,0.0916,5.3022,7.2129,0.8494,3.0543,2.4828,4.3226,1.262,0.6392,0.5749,3.9153,2.2343,1.5988,1.043,1.2124,3.8951,5.4723,5.561,2.2742,1.1571,0.8341,2.1302,2.6058,5.919,0.8664,2.3388,1.7679,0.2273,3.9811,1.1818,0.8961,4.1861,1.0907,3.3585,3.3319,0.0008,5.3212,3.9567,0.0097,4.6542,2.4443,1.9083,3.5706,0.0017,0.0021,0.241,0.6874,0.3543,4.9886,0.4836,0.635,2.6259,4.2623,2.0366,0.7703,1.5154,1.2177,1.8247,6.1341,2.5714,1.81,0.0726,4.9553,2.5318,3.4616,2.2128,0.9686,0.7986,5.4879,1.6771,0.7927,2.636,2.006,0.0005,0.0045,0.0445,3.0807,4.8858,0.9046,1.4222,3.7431,0.8972,2.2279,6.057,2.361,2.7358,1.2316,0.245,1.3334,1.4065,3.1511,1.1753,2.2199,2.8777,3.489,2.9711,2.3211,2.0915,1.8074,3.6833,2.7926,3.8312,1.3364,0.4139,0.2429,0.4486,3.0138,6.1038,3.7768,2.9971,1.2651,6.2632,1.4316,2.4341,0.0007,0.0033,0.0257,3.9389,0.4562,5.1387,1.221,3.126,2.064,4.4549,1.3216,0.0338,1.7355,2.0927,0.8465,7.3949,1.7069,3.8255,6.3253,0.0024,0.0057,0.5938,4.3072,1.2227,1.4074,0.0709,1.2975,4.5732,0.7979,0.3302,0.4109,3.3126,5.8405,5.1409,1.4029,4.4814,2.7847,6.3223,1.6604,1.2057]}

He has not recognized his wrong. He has not asked America for forgiveness.\u201d\nGraham said he was not surprised by Trump \u2019s remarks. \u201cYou can bet he thinks he is right. He thinks he is a president of the Confederate States of America. He just went beyond that, he said he was willing to go to the battlefield,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would think twice about what he said on Saturday afternoon, I think he is getting his marching orders from his Republican base here in Charlotte, North Carolina.\u201d\nMeanwhile, another former President of the United States, George W. Bush has also criticized Trump, saying \u201cit\u2019s not the end of the world. It\u2019s not the end of America. But it is, unfortunately, the beginning of the end of our democracy. \u201c\nFor our inaugural #GrahamQuilting show in 2020, I was excited to present an event that was full of women, who are passionate about quilting, with a beautiful piece of their work, and a message that could really touch you.\nThis is our #GrahamQuilting show with PI:USER. And what the heck.. this is the first show I\u2019ve ever hosted, and it went wonderfully! I wasn\u2019t expecting that! It was a huge honor and I was so pleased with your responses \u2013 but most importantly, you were so very impressed! \u2764\ufe0f","token_len":430,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.3359,4.1445,0.0258,4.0657,1.9999,2.5311,5.2603,6.6653,1.5149,6.0212,0.4463,0.0041,3.1766,1.2085,3.5305,3.1971,3.9796,1.9476,1.7842,0.0006,3.7495,3.2569,18.3775,8.0999,9.4318,5.7994,0.4609,0.2641,0.5279,0.892,0.446,1.5849,11.0143,1.1153,1.7703,0.306,0.2804,16.4788,5.3361,0.6013,0.734,2.2,3.69,3.8151,2.6755,8.8821,1.9634,2.3372,3.554,0.1162,0.6376,1.1899,2.0215,2.0798,6.1973,2.2973,6.0585,1.0864,4.4929,0.2708,2.6673,3.7104,0.5254,2.7679,6.2818,0.2965,1.0444,5.866,0.2818,0.7638,0.8405,0.3926,0.1759,6.5387,5.9235,6.9956,1.8365,6.914,5.4457,3.1681,5.4403,4.27,2.1079,1.3685,7.3955,4.2874,0.9027,6.5728,5.879,0.2356,2.629,3.2066,1.3476,1.3754,2.4462,0.318,3.1836,2.9776,1.0115,0.0351,0.0097,0.0011,1.4702,1.3015,0.203,5.0661,2.6983,6.7188,3.6692,1.5775,4.5861,6.6009,7.161,1.9515,3.4135,8.9917,1.7648,5.9887,3.2419,3.4209,4.6605,0.675,5.0718,1.18,1.9079,0.7125,0.612,7.2719,4.2664,7.6204,3.1634,1.5033,0.4122,0.6267,5.4535,5.0087,3.5052,0.3368,0.7754,2.1227,1.6617,1.3484,2.9701,1.3868,1.475,2.1233,2.7798,2.5843,0.7125,0.5518,6.0387,0.9326,0.9767,1.8692,1.6507,4.3001,0.5423,5.4506,2.5223,4.5475,1.2773,3.6283,1.4572,1.7677,4.0699,1.4311,1.6436,1.5676,0.684,0.3887,3.6506,4.2642,2.2638,0.239,10.7628,0.2948,0.1025,0.0009,0.7285,1.2374,5.0082,4.8773,5.4061,1.1523,2.5687,2.0627,1.9705,2.165,1.5507,4.9158,0.0233,2.8451,2.1859,1.8325,6.6541,2.2636,2.6773,0.7945,3.2995,0.3662,0.4224,1.3768,0.1603,2.6195,2.3239,5.8633,6.2822,0.0215,0.8737,4.2219,2.5831,3.7152,4.6229,0.3621,3.7605,0.8827,0.544,4.6913,1.7919,5.4107,1.8218,4.6374,1.1672,1.3088,1.5042,5.8651,3.2942,3.8048,0.0232,1.4675,2.5456,6.4898,2.6098,5.2225,0.9479,9.07,1.1659,2.0924,0.0003,0.8561,2.1592,0.5703,0.2227,6.6944,0.0906,5.4495,3.6386,4.9776,1.584,0.1129,0.2642,0.0112,0.6626,1.4773,0.2001,0.0115,0.0014,5.2697,2.74,3.3436,0.4709,1.9556,0.8767,6.8975,1.7494,3.6922,2.7832,2.5515,0.0873,2.5801,2.6719,5.8544,0.1418,0.4896,0.2441,0.9723,6.7304,1.5835,0.8982,0.0858,0.8076,0.7965,0.1444,0.1025,2.2426,0.7106,3.9403,1.7971,1.4591,3.7367,6.4767,0.1324,1.1918,0.2831,0.3881,0.813,0.0525,0.7703,2.7946,3.3953,0.5406,2.8954,0.2026,2.8801,4.8288,6.0761,8.1948,10.4754,9.9057,8.5426,7.2551,1.4412,5.6202,4.4712,9.8554,0.8492,2.7277,4.3816,6.4386,0.5687,5.1383,4.0244,4.2021,1.5738,2.2892,5.2257,0.034,6.8827,1.4775,4.3679,2.0479,4.8403,0.2576,11.5543,0.8378,0.0021,1.3917,4.5752,1.4381,4.9792,5.5508,0.7514,6.9482,3.5311,2.2278,2.2436,1.9995,4.9105,0.8663,5.1896,4.3512,5.7702,4.6899,1.3119,3.0936,4.0979,1.0369,4.03,3.9631,2.2082,0.5248,0.0333,0.0024,1.1816,4.6263,13.5941,5.5643,15.304,3.4274,4.8115,5.1048,4.383,3.3421,7.5562,4.1395,0.4439,1.788,2.1558,4.1382,2.1878,6.0891,2.6801,0.6282,0.4907,1.7251,2.2317,1.2871,1.9568,5.7671,7.9728,3.9598,2.5214,6.6583,0.6153,0.6885,0.1541,1.8975,2.6945,3.3789,3.1169,0.9118,2.0815,4.1442,3.0222,2.2245,2.0817,3.0827,1.9167,4.7474,1.8708,6.7727,5.5049,6.636,4.2847,5.8797,0.2892,0.5074,2.434,2.1229,2.2577,4.0058,6.8007,3.1702,6.5609,0.0192,0.9547]}

Gruevski , 47 , resigned earlier","text":"Macedonia s main opposition party, the rightist VMRO-DPMNE formally replaced its leader Nikola Gruevski on Saturday and appointed Hristijan Mickoski, a technocrat, as his successor. Gruevski, 47, resigned earlier this month after the party was stripped of its minority government posts. Gruevski's deputy, Tomislav Nikolic, is the first leader of VMRO-DPMNE to resign after taking power in a power grab in late June. The opposition had hoped to keep Gruevski as leader, but Mickoski said that Gruevski was the only person legally qualified to do so. VMRO-DPMNE, which has been on the right of the political spectrum at times in the past, has been trying to move closer to the mainstream center. VMRO-DPMNE President Tomislav Nikolic. Nikolic has said on his Facebook page that it would not allow itself to be dislodged from the government. Nikolic said that he and co-presidents of other two parties would have enough seats to return to the government if Gruevski stayed on. However, Gruetvski will likely be replaced. Mickoski, a former Minister for Entrepreneurship and Small and Medium Sized Entreprises, has said he would not like to take over any more roles. He has previously said that he considers himself to be the right man for the job. Mickoski, who is former Chief of the Economic Development Agency, is not widely trusted in the region. He has been criticized for his economic and political decisions. He was in charge of government when economic reforms were launched in the years 2000-2001, and he has vowed not to repeat that mistake. He has said he wants to continue to implement reforms in a manner that provides stability.

The man has described himself as a former intelligence man in a North Korean-commissioned nuclear program \u2014 without, so far, saying how he was recruited into the program.\nA former intelligence worker turned North Korean spy has been accused of selling Australian uranium components to North Korea in a bid to gain further access to its nuclear program. The suspect, who was arrested this week by the Australian Federal Police and was charged with seven counts related to his work for North Korea, told police his role in the alleged scheme was \"just a matter of passing along a phone call\" from his employer, whom he didn't name, from overseas. He was charged with one count of possessing or supplying material for the purpose of proliferation of nuclear weapons, one count of trafficking nuclear related material and two counts of trafficking radioactive material\nA North Korean-commissioned nuclear program used sophisticated stolen technology from the US to assemble nuclear missiles with the capacity to reach the United States without warning, and then detonate them, according to an unclassified report filed by intelligence analysts with President Trump in September. The report, signed by two intelligence services officials, described the unmanned missile systems as \"one of the most sophisticated and lethal weapons programs currently operating in North Korea\".\nA North Korean officer was convicted last Friday in the United States of aiding North Korea's nuclear program and sentenced to 25 years in prison, a US jury said in a unanimous verdict that was based on \"state-sponsored cover-up and fraud\".

{"prompt":"The leaders of the European Union s remaining 27 member states are very likely to approve this week the deal struck by their chief negotiator with Britain and move to a second phase of exit","text":"The leaders of the European Union s remaining 27 member states are very likely to approve this week the deal struck by their chief negotiator with Britain and move to a second phase of exit negotiations with the European institutions, the prime ministers of three member states said on Monday. The leaders say they will make a second summit a \u201cpriority\u201d to approve a deal that is expected on Friday.\nAfter more than two years of negotiations, leaders of EU member states agreed at a meeting on Friday to give Britain its first formal exit contract with the European Union. The deal, which paves the way for a trade agreement, was struck by the chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier amid intense pressure from EU countries, who wanted to avoid the chaos of a no-deal Brexit.\nSome 300,000 jobs in Britain are currently dependent on the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which provides for the support of farmers. If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on agriculture next January and leaves the Common Market, it would lose access to subsidies \u2013 and the \u00a325 billion a year is likely to hit hard.\nThe government said no work permits have been required by EU countries so far this year, despite fears raised by some lawmakers that migrants were breaking laws by entering the UK illegally.\nAccording to the BBC, Britain has detained more than 40 illegal migrants within the EU since the Brexit deadline of March 31, 2019. There have been a massive surge in arrests in the North of England, with almost one in five people being apprehended. London has also seen a significant increase in illegal immigrants recently.\nSince January 29, 2020, the UK has detained over 40 per cent more illegal immigrants arriving from EU countries through sea and land ports. Around 3,000 EU citizens have arrived onshore illegally in UK ports after the 31 March 2020 deadline with nearly 2,000 in Calais alone. The British authorities estimate that more than 2 million immigrants have entered the UK illegally since 2016.\nI love that we have had 5 days of uninterrupted rain, and every morning it is bright and foggy. I cannot believe that we are going to end February on a high note so far\u2026..","token_len":432,"entropy":[8.3059,0.3937,0.9879,4.2619,0.717,11.0876,12.0696,3.5586,1.1451,0.0354,2.318,6.7853,4.4188,0.0629,5.1867,4.5083,5.1317,3.1094,3.9694,5.8739,1.2247,4.1945,6.2446,1.5827,3.6727,3.447,2.6577,9.3542,1.6889,2.8797,3.301,2.0007,0.3841,8.8446,0.6623,2.7263,0.6256,2.9993,6.8174,1.9805,2.3605,5.7096,3.3317,1.2376,4.9542,3.9897,0.0665,1.3339,1.0751,1.6384,0.1931,3.2527,2.6319,5.7448,1.1923,1.5187,4.2543,1.6871,5.3308,5.6619,7.3933,17.018,6.5137,7.5214,1.8272,8.1573,2.7529,6.593,3.0221,1.465,2.2877,2.7112,1.9549,5.2583,2.3348,0.4093,0.713,17.0309,4.8827,0.0139,1.3821,0.7603,0.1328,1.1335,0.4734,6.0956,0.5411,4.411,1.3773,0.0369,3.3068,3.9359,1.4282,2.5449,1.7166,2.3174,0.5866,4.8726,2.9986,4.1156,1.8877,3.4749,1.8589,6.5717,2.4134,0.3775,1.8814,0.2252,1.2125,1.4975,1.7653,2.2292,0.8527,9.1983,0.0131,0.0549,0.0023,0.0674,1.5373,4.9529,2.3636,2.6228,2.4453,3.7058,1.3884,1.0796,5.3768,6.1942,0.0215,2.3456,0.0,0.0,6.7657,3.5169,2.0129,0.5262,3.2707,3.6056,2.1715,1.9506,4.2508,1.0842,2.328,2.5939,5.4804,1.1475,1.4181,7.8045,0.464,0.0642,1.1438,0.67,0.6335,8.1466,7.122,0.8653,0.0012,3.3907,3.4689,1.0645,1.8587,3.5732,3.8581,0.0614,1.2916,1.5695,1.2101,6.1907,0.5811,0.0029,1.6339,0.191,0.696,0.6262,2.589,2.3912,1.6847,5.4345,0.3159,2.3666,2.2832,5.47,0.8746,1.0273,0.1525,0.5727,3.9318,1.3688,0.846,2.3796,4.0349,6.7674,6.0134,4.3037,3.1557,0.4789,5.4328,4.5233,0.8782,2.0284,1.1644,2.6829,3.9937,0.0109,6.4163,6.1657,2.8403,2.6864,5.3319,4.6037,1.1666,2.7241,0.0199,8.299,2.2997,0.0283,6.3845,4.2775,2.1334,0.7031,1.6044,4.6135,2.4357,6.2434,6.5695,7.5682,3.0127,0.0576,4.1068,3.4296,1.2267,2.3329,4.4027,0.8055,3.9871,0.2162,1.3797,3.6018,3.6809,7.0513,0.3619,1.4665,5.7952,0.4553,6.235,2.9564,5.2676,4.5137,2.3973,2.9852,0.5891,0.5105,1.3421,0.2464,0.9292,6.1272,0.0049,0.9375,4.399,0.2368,4.0131,2.0076,8.948,1.786,0.1423,4.4909,6.3107,0.8534,6.0457,0.799,1.6366,1.8653,1.5669,2.2604,6.3162,2.5796,2.193,1.698,1.0941,6.7215,0.359,4.512,1.0655,0.4761,3.3635,7.6789,2.1481,0.1232,4.1627,1.8573,1.5494,6.137,2.5603,0.3599,1.5803,1.968,4.986,3.9928,1.3487,1.0133,1.5505,2.19,4.4342,3.1058,6.9571,1.7392,2.0094,1.5393,1.1537,3.5962,0.7163,0.0224,3.7662,2.6795,7.2599,1.3064,0.486,5.5474,4.0759,4.3625,0.1653,7.5286,0.1233,1.3963,1.9321,0.1681,1.973,2.7493,3.7377,5.5223,0.0021,2.1549,1.0456,0.4236,7.7656,2.5389,4.5596,0.3863,7.3128,7.4829,2.4574,0.3435,4.7287,1.5834,4.7554,4.0918,0.3366,0.84,4.2306,0.9626,1.0502,2.6001,3.0346,4.4813,4.2067,1.5896,5.8331,1.3331,6.3099,2.1808,6.2435,1.3638,5.0549,0.0667,7.2823,4.2901,3.662,0.0995,0.6073,3.7552,2.8059,3.1511,0.4198,2.4881,4.3382,2.8485,3.7486,0.5106,3.0125,0.0449,2.9297,3.2979,4.3713,1.27,2.4757,0.2882,0.2441,0.9543,1.4765,5.7064,0.6503,0.4849,7.2803,7.2427,4.4709,2.1633,1.4192,4.1577,7.2316,4.3521,1.202,6.0578,4.7226,2.3922,2.037,5.2832,3.4965,3.533,1.8611,6.9507,1.0997,7.397,0.0094,1.0359,2.0001,5.7643,1.4485,1.3778,1.4728,1.3863,3.0794,0.1387,3.6749,10.5498,4.0275,0.8839,2.2247,0.4052,5.6048,4.5495,8.9179]}
{"prompt":"Iran s Supreme Court has upheld a death sentence against an Iranian academic with Swedish residency convicted of espionage , Amnesty International and his family said on Tuesday . Ahmadreza Djalali , a doctor and","text":"Iran s Supreme Court has upheld a death sentence against an Iranian academic with Swedish residency convicted of espionage, Amnesty International and his family said on Tuesday. Ahmadreza Djalali, a doctor and lecturer at University of Gothenburg, was sentenced to death in February for \" espionage, in complicity with foreign agents \".\nThe Swedish government demanded the court s order be revised before it was executed. Sweden's foreign ministry said it remains unable to find any facts to support Djalali s sentence.\nDjalali \" is a human rights activist and a leading figure in Iranian academia, with a long-standing presence in academic circles, \" including with the Iranian Association for the Promotion of Science and Technology, \" the ministry said on its official website.\nThe court s verdict follows Iran s announcement last month that it had decided to bring the death penalty back in vigor. In February, Iranian judiciary authorities carried out dozens of executions of prisoners, including one scientist who was sentenced to death for \" espionage. \" The official IRNA news agency said that his crime was a fabrication of evidence, the same as for the two scientists earlier hanged by Tehran. Reuters does not independently verify information from Iran.\nWhen a client calls you a \u201cgreen person,\u201d you likely automatically respond with a list of the many ways an office uses paper. How many \u201cwhite pencils?\u201d \u201cpen holders?\u201d \u201cprinters?\u201d\nYes! These are all items that I frequently receive. But when I talk with clients about a project, I often find they have questions about other smaller items that they perceive to be less important: things like coffee mugs, water bottles and paper towels.\nThis is perhaps one reason that so few organizations have made significant changes to their print purchases. I once attended a workshop on sustainability with the goal of reducing paper waste. What seemed like a good idea at the time did not translate well to practice. Not only had the participants misplaced the printed materials that they thought they were recycling, but by removing items from the printer tray such as staples, people ended up using up more paper.","token_len":432,"entropy":[7.8228,11.0819,0.5886,2.8303,3.391,1.5854,6.3519,0.9897,2.2854,3.6938,2.5371,7.0178,5.3787,11.4316,3.252,6.2433,0.3577,3.8173,2.3905,5.2125,0.1139,4.4896,7.0682,1.7365,1.3186,1.0578,1.685,0.1407,7.1798,10.412,0.3885,8.3516,3.3506,1.2682,0.7716,1.7056,5.1997,2.0284,3.9079,0.6014,4.4112,0.5412,3.1416,0.0026,0.0003,0.8476,0.7934,0.7613,0.3052,1.244,1.3757,3.1266,1.96,3.834,10.0909,2.1728,5.5362,8.3753,0.2005,3.6,4.2171,6.9066,1.1687,8.5935,3.0972,1.8027,7.7175,1.718,3.7161,10.464,4.8053,7.3903,5.4521,4.8458,1.5093,3.6962,4.4209,0.8674,4.9585,1.1766,2.1593,0.7922,0.8258,1.5348,7.7708,5.9146,0.0267,4.6113,1.7621,6.8423,1.4588,0.4328,4.7415,0.0022,0.0002,7.2982,5.0767,0.4831,0.5077,3.2705,0.032,0.0009,0.0002,5.9705,3.8599,1.3143,5.1569,0.0177,1.2116,1.4145,2.1075,4.0028,1.5907,0.2419,5.0729,6.8929,2.2959,3.6827,1.6612,2.9178,2.9966,0.1933,4.6163,0.2062,6.424,0.4758,2.6646,6.2686,5.0275,4.1813,0.9783,2.347,4.9585,1.2604,2.1333,1.9959,0.0577,2.6336,0.477,0.549,1.8896,4.3018,2.0346,0.7232,0.1863,2.679,0.8591,2.1796,0.4882,0.3142,0.4327,1.7956,3.1387,5.4967,5.1224,4.3565,5.4425,3.5476,5.7622,1.741,0.8443,0.2222,0.2955,2.0092,4.035,0.3185,4.839,2.0378,2.1074,0.1149,4.2907,3.0838,13.8924,0.2786,1.5812,3.6976,3.4564,0.4745,2.8115,7.7354,3.9699,3.9991,0.0151,6.8269,0.0049,0.9384,1.5046,5.5883,2.105,1.1954,4.0208,4.83,1.195,0.8351,2.3767,0.1142,0.2711,1.2038,2.6091,1.5055,3.7063,3.9356,2.9055,5.2918,3.6232,0.0122,0.0636,0.0324,1.7253,1.8584,6.1039,6.3688,0.698,2.8072,7.237,1.8365,3.4499,2.1062,4.4273,3.5206,0.829,4.1244,1.6872,4.9792,4.0397,7.4009,6.9889,2.4061,3.4175,1.3234,7.2434,7.1698,0.0072,4.3549,0.1213,5.306,1.9697,2.2293,2.6117,0.4143,6.7607,3.8699,9.0746,5.6464,4.4552,4.4198,14.7049,5.0408,10.3898,5.057,2.5022,4.1848,7.6994,1.8544,8.7853,7.8522,2.5261,1.2683,1.6986,5.6594,0.0784,2.8606,5.543,3.463,6.4902,8.9312,8.0011,9.2118,2.8542,6.6576,1.7256,8.2825,0.1362,5.553,12.5524,0.0615,2.3732,2.3684,1.5063,4.8855,0.2694,6.0184,10.8994,0.259,0.0891,0.1263,0.9518,0.0136,6.9511,0.4432,0.2091,0.0325,0.0089,3.5913,6.3148,5.159,5.2728,0.8769,2.8046,6.9769,1.1272,5.7307,6.4121,4.3066,2.6139,3.411,3.0087,0.6161,4.1707,2.2546,3.3102,1.9363,3.9768,4.0928,1.1402,1.102,1.3946,2.9673,3.6841,2.8094,4.6148,0.7077,4.4398,9.6626,3.079,2.2858,1.9607,8.377,1.6522,0.1356,2.4284,0.5028,4.8455,5.2133,0.8425,7.437,3.4849,0.0173,0.8209,5.6829,0.6433,2.8104,4.1885,1.8873,0.3296,1.096,3.8058,1.1962,5.8776,2.4642,2.3922,1.9354,3.9469,3.534,6.1876,2.7285,4.4689,3.8777,2.6795,0.5493,0.3989,6.7737,9.2408,0.901,3.71,5.0022,6.096,0.422,3.6283,1.4945,5.8566,3.2326,3.1371,5.8451,0.0636,2.9942,3.7406,1.1265,1.3183,5.4749,5.2693,0.6435,0.6104,3.8525,0.2953,2.5204,0.2096,0.0313,5.2517,0.3951,3.8142,3.2038,2.7679,1.9537,1.105,5.7631,0.6877,3.7313,1.5403,4.7577,10.5401,1.6325,5.7997,3.1879,4.2702,1.3088,4.3588,2.1677,1.0014,4.6599,0.2684,0.6949,5.7543,6.6191,5.8072,1.5037,0.838,5.61,6.045,7.5419,0.1324,8.3565,0.9404,7.6446,5.5828,0.0021,2.859,4.7029,3.4822,1.0711,1.086]}

General Assembly vote on Tuesday had been delayed by four days until March 14.\nIsrael has repeatedly told Trump that the move to establish the embassy would not happen until after all U.S. diplomats have left the White House. The Israeli state does not recognize the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and refuses to allow the foreign missions in it to have diplomatic status.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Israel in Jerusalem, the Palestinians' official capital, and international diplomacy have long recognized it as a special case within diplomatic relations. It lacks any government and is administered by U.S. military personnel and their families who do not belong to diplomatic relations.\nTrump s announcement came after Netanyahu delivered a speech in Tel Aviv in front of thousands where he vowed that if the U.S. embassy moves there, Israel will leave the United Nations.\nMacron took the lead immediately in recognizing the Israeli capital, saying it was his personal belief that Jerusalem should be an issue for dialogue only among parties concerned and not of the outside world.","token_len":432,"entropy":[8.7383,2.0286,4.95,8.7849,1.0092,6.171,0.0171,0.204,0.0383,0.368,0.3874,0.0062,8.5814,7.8502,3.4687,5.431,1.3119,3.7686,1.424,6.6993,0.6303,1.5505,5.1975,10.5308,5.6208,6.2216,0.9027,0.2352,2.9786,2.0637,1.8319,7.3593,6.9375,2.664,0.3539,1.3738,0.0026,6.019,1.4529,0.7917,0.2503,24.5337,0.0005,6.1625,2.3369,3.0758,5.4414,0.5483,3.4358,6.2013,2.921,0.7632,1.8289,3.8807,2.1799,2.2011,4.5076,7.6208,2.3337,1.8599,9.0796,2.6463,5.1977,6.2164,0.2781,1.4537,4.3349,3.0909,1.937,0.5843,2.4557,8.9803,0.2705,0.0012,2.0427,7.2815,2.3925,3.7212,2.163,5.7186,5.0974,5.4487,0.0004,0.0235,0.0539,6.6451,0.7962,0.3969,0.1436,5.4983,0.0024,0.0292,0.0264,3.6017,1.5461,2.8054,3.9756,5.5878,0.2301,1.912,1.4136,4.7411,0.1902,0.1237,0.7161,6.6642,0.0403,1.1822,3.5312,3.4441,5.1451,3.0783,5.6768,4.6931,6.427,4.0275,0.7094,4.1836,3.4949,0.4985,0.3916,0.2898,5.5885,1.6625,4.2816,0.0015,5.2014,0.7501,0.9662,0.0,3.1472,3.3031,0.0304,2.2539,5.5707,6.3296,5.3006,5.5294,0.7235,1.3766,0.5172,0.3677,2.2693,5.6259,4.5367,0.894,2.8336,2.7881,3.893,1.0609,0.5433,1.3486,3.3856,2.8211,2.5487,3.0862,3.4035,0.6607,0.2734,3.371,2.2666,1.9864,7.8435,5.1968,2.1355,3.8616,4.5229,2.0767,3.4838,5.7112,1.2994,1.6432,0.0119,0.9767,3.1549,0.6386,1.9227,2.5877,4.2174,1.9054,2.0025,1.7546,0.456,1.2507,0.2318,2.7809,3.0468,4.6835,3.607,2.6593,0.9556,6.0144,0.4661,1.0739,7.2784,0.3916,0.0011,0.0123,0.0002,1.8572,2.9644,2.4964,2.8687,2.5197,5.2798,0.0852,1.4278,7.3214,0.9602,3.5833,3.4552,0.4913,0.2875,2.6715,2.7689,0.0007,4.037,0.1764,1.9755,0.0031,4.6233,0.8057,3.0024,4.6146,1.6279,2.1193,1.475,4.1793,0.7689,5.3976,5.4673,3.7224,1.6269,0.7081,4.7521,1.9536,3.0588,5.7085,1.2718,0.7313,1.8534,1.6516,2.8648,1.5978,0.2941,0.3993,1.3302,1.9448,4.3176,2.0843,1.4755,6.4557,3.0391,0.001,0.2845,0.0435,3.7022,2.2728,0.8142,0.7742,5.4944,0.0041,0.6429,3.0488,3.3221,5.8807,5.1602,0.028,2.1278,1.1448,2.104,0.0004,0.135,0.2494,3.109,0.4142,0.4555,2.2841,2.4042,0.2832,0.1874,0.211,1.6506,1.2077,7.1495,0.043,2.9899,2.5602,6.5217,5.7633,3.3473,4.8036,0.1575,4.589,1.9195,0.6356,0.3423,0.2765,2.1131,1.7219,0.0005,0.1574,0.0495,1.8788,0.3024,1.8756,3.6937,0.8766,2.1568,3.0662,8.3963,0.1767,2.2894,1.8324,0.6814,4.2254,7.0803,5.5752,1.6438,3.4226,6.4579,3.4486,0.1191,2.0183,5.9575,5.428,4.5667,6.855,2.3088,0.7906,3.9154,8.4557,3.7183,5.7533,4.8909,2.3168,5.0607,0.2219,4.6133,0.0004,0.5089,0.0977,4.6066,2.1418,2.7472,4.6142,0.8201,5.424,3.2598,0.0458,2.6981,0.193,6.4564,4.4326,0.5823,0.4401,2.4371,3.6837,2.0358,2.7451,1.9295,2.8332,6.1935,0.6996,0.7078,1.4981,3.5959,0.0007,2.9245,6.4188,0.0012,2.9325,9.5521,0.0901,3.4514,2.8037,3.6177,1.2956,0.9447,0.0004,0.0185,0.012,3.2364,4.089,3.5145,0.8368,2.5837,1.2878,4.522,0.7976,2.4056,3.0026,0.9969,0.5395,7.1037,0.0039,5.5239,1.4291,4.289,7.7026,2.4721,4.0701,0.6997,3.3044,1.7813,1.9265,1.7074,2.1458,1.2496,3.9565,5.0471,4.1376,0.2244,2.0228,1.2686,0.743,3.5856,8.5047,1.3715,5.8052,7.4855,5.9587,4.3584,3.4421,3.7468,2.1338,6.4147,2.1359,8.0915,0.0654,0.171]}
{"prompt":"President Donald Trump endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore on Monday , throwing his weight behind the embattled Alabama Republican before a special election next week that has been rocked by allegations of sexual misconduct","text":"President Donald Trump endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore on Monday, throwing his weight behind the embattled Alabama Republican before a special election next week that has been rocked by allegations of sexual misconduct against his daughter.\nThe rally drew criticism after media outlets confirmed that Trump had used a phone call in January to ask that Rep. Jeff Van Drew of the Georgia House of Representatives, a potential rival to Moore in the special election, not be considered a candidate because of his refusal to endorse Trump for re-election. At the same time, Van Drew later issued a statement denying he had done anything improper.\nMoore\u2019s bid for re-election fell apart in September, as revelations of widespread sexual misconduct against his 17-year-old daughter surfaced. Now he\u2019s trying to pick up the pieces.\nBut several women say they\u2019ve been victims of sexual assault by Moore, who has repeatedly deflected the claims in interviews and statements. But Van Drew quickly took to Twitter to respond, saying \u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric about abuse was not the same as my own experience or the experiences of many other victims.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Van Drew has since confirmed that Van Drew never asked to not take the special election in exchange for something. Moore had threatened Van Drew \u2014 who is married to a Van Drew aide \u2014 with a lawsuit before the media broke the story about Trump\u2019s phone call to Van Drew. The attorney general of Alabama filed a lawsuit against the Republican and Van Drew\u2019s campaign.\n\u201cIf he would have asked me if I would run for office he\u2019d have needed to come to me and consult with me, and I would have said no. I think it was rude of him to do it unilaterally,\u201d Moore told WAMU\u2019s Brian Stelter last month.\nRepublican Rep. Jason Smith, who has pushed to remove Moore from the Senate and take his seat, told Stelter \u2014 an Associated Press affiliate \u2014 Saturday that Van Drew has played no role in the harassment claims against Moore, only that they \u201cshould be taken seriously.\u201d","token_len":433,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,8.119,6.0576,0.0056,0.025,0.0329,3.7574,0.1159,1.241,0.0242,2.5937,2.2285,1.0155,8.0091,1.095,4.868,0.0177,0.9986,3.1929,2.7524,1.5542,6.0999,2.2067,2.2253,0.1635,3.6874,1.1417,3.6972,3.5899,2.3207,4.8859,0.0196,0.605,0.3063,0.159,0.1607,1.9167,4.207,7.5964,0.531,0.1587,15.5835,7.0015,3.9499,6.4362,3.9536,5.6017,1.1463,6.248,1.4745,2.4439,1.2793,6.0869,1.5962,5.3916,0.4305,3.4102,4.1219,1.1004,3.0843,5.1009,7.2807,0.0026,3.6349,10.2221,19.4272,3.0483,6.1533,7.9078,2.4768,0.287,0.2541,2.8922,1.5186,5.4915,4.547,1.5745,0.1743,3.5007,0.1454,2.4806,0.0837,0.49,2.3585,1.6918,4.5922,2.5446,1.1089,4.5528,0.5583,0.5614,6.0003,0.0136,2.7331,3.3452,2.9187,3.76,0.0034,0.0008,0.2872,7.0019,0.5768,2.0757,0.093,0.0381,2.8112,0.0063,5.8178,4.0583,0.2011,0.1186,3.0885,3.771,0.4657,5.2102,0.9866,1.432,0.8239,0.1239,15.3906,16.2693,10.4333,4.2754,6.4317,0.9119,1.745,0.0009,0.0002,4.8494,1.3725,1.9576,4.6401,1.5021,3.0348,5.7482,1.8202,2.6231,0.3966,0.0862,1.7425,3.0707,6.6841,0.0422,0.0019,0.0114,0.0018,0.2129,2.1647,0.55,6.3584,2.9579,7.9181,0.6867,0.002,3.7988,0.0356,5.6173,0.3136,1.1824,1.5318,1.717,0.2747,4.5021,6.165,3.8294,3.6544,1.0427,6.1898,0.5153,1.4979,1.4607,5.9477,0.0553,0.9108,2.1757,1.6261,1.7663,1.7033,1.1272,1.0723,3.6518,7.8842,0.615,3.2949,5.0913,2.4816,2.7537,1.2978,5.9736,1.2268,5.6135,4.0855,0.0144,7.5547,4.3034,0.3709,0.3478,0.6736,4.5776,2.2784,1.418,10.4904,6.0789,5.1669,3.9964,0.1045,0.0817,6.6394,1.9568,7.4116,2.7914,2.7506,3.3271,2.8248,0.1601,8.1396,2.0433,2.7755,4.9383,2.3785,2.6224,0.0882,2.331,1.5673,3.4186,1.1448,5.9431,6.8697,0.3389,4.2548,3.5925,0.0313,1.4304,0.0016,5.3303,2.9677,3.5316,0.6258,2.9039,0.0103,5.1687,3.6031,2.5883,6.6609,6.1069,2.1043,5.1632,0.0599,3.6998,7.2319,0.0032,9.2197,3.7061,6.145,4.6934,6.015,5.8521,0.0042,6.5158,0.9038,1.8653,2.7438,0.7048,1.7088,10.3389,0.0684,2.5167,0.435,1.0643,1.1977,1.2522,5.6656,0.974,6.2381,3.9237,0.1407,0.674,2.9843,5.4083,3.6431,0.0087,0.0129,2.6744,0.1509,3.6322,3.5757,0.0141,0.9004,3.1686,4.3896,1.3826,3.3391,0.0846,4.0184,0.4968,1.3752,1.4775,1.4381,3.3618,2.8787,2.4189,0.0011,5.5857,0.012,0.1057,2.7992,2.1928,0.3179,4.6681,0.8247,5.1906,3.7309,4.1296,1.4639,2.2519,2.2137,3.5106,0.798,0.9333,4.1899,1.1788,3.1873,4.3435,2.5455,0.029,3.0772,1.2174,7.6155,0.4064,4.7042,1.4624,0.8284,1.4075,9.9942,0.7779,0.3259,2.5933,1.8947,1.2887,0.9944,0.3271,1.9849,1.0126,0.7539,1.8172,3.6762,2.1117,1.2226,6.7922,1.5194,0.324,0.3787,2.0324,2.5217,10.2743,1.8446,6.6679,1.5797,5.3979,1.7523,4.9149,3.9851,0.2788,4.1809,1.5361,0.7045,4.8364,3.5122,0.074,0.0182,3.4672,1.5333,0.2027,0.3354,6.0321,4.2224,0.0031,3.3809,7.668,1.5051,1.3621,2.0208,4.9597,2.3087,2.8049,1.3292,0.2987,0.4853,2.0937,4.3249,6.5407,2.2371,0.4717,3.4932,2.1215,5.6276,0.0057,0.0007,6.9688,4.6822,6.3565,0.0001,6.3107,1.3036,6.3405,0.326,1.7789,0.0033,3.7161,7.3539,1.8352,0.1148,0.0585,0.9029,5.1365,4.0964,1.5384,1.0044,2.2822,5.2205,1.5916,3.2946,6.301,0.2013,3.5013,2.0577,2.9039,0.2219,0.4652,6.6577,1.0143]}

The plan is set to be unveiled this week. \u201cFor the first time in a generation, the president\u2019s plan proposes to increase taxes on the middle class,\u201d the budget analysis said. Republican Gov. Scott Walker is expected to unveil his tax plan on Tuesday morning. \u201cIt would be the largest tax increase in the history of the country\u2019s history,\u201d the analysis reads. The one-page summary was released less then two weeks after a top staff member at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter calling for a complete repeal of Obamacare. The chamber\u2019s analysis said the tax plan would eliminate a $300 billion annual tax cut to individuals, while cutting the annual budget deficits $400 billion. Other critics said it would bring about a 20 percent rise in payroll taxes for most Americans. \u201cThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s proposal to repeal tax benefits for the middle class is a slap in the face to America\u2019s workers and retirees,\u201d said the Treasury Department\u2019s study, which will be available in full only to U.S. officials, lawmakers and U.S. government officials. The White House was quick to respond, saying the tax plan \u201cdoes not go nearly far enough in trying to help American families and businesses.\u201d But the Obama administration has sought to reassure taxpayers that it is committed to a more balanced budget. The Treasury Department also said that a U.S. Treasury Department audit of some 400 pages of Obama\u2019s tax plan concluded that it is \u201creasonable to expect\u201d that the plan will meet budgetary objectives under the budget reconciliation procedure. The U.S. Congress will conduct public hearing on the tax plan later this week and it is expected to vote on it later in the year.","token_len":433,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.1102,1.1159,4.2443,1.8313,3.0473,1.1832,7.5442,0.0507,0.277,5.0918,0.386,1.0345,5.2199,3.5263,2.6865,1.4478,0.0622,3.1473,5.8338,1.334,1.9594,3.5532,1.7179,3.5319,7.9127,2.6212,0.4862,4.2981,1.8932,0.0013,5.598,1.0129,1.6133,9.1307,1.4472,4.4827,18.1054,6.214,7.947,8.3677,0.8066,0.1996,0.1262,0.7239,4.1483,1.5009,6.7226,7.5502,9.6456,3.9139,3.3129,7.3676,0.57,7.3026,7.7661,4.13,3.6439,0.0866,2.5771,3.4931,2.9256,4.1528,0.026,1.8831,1.52,2.5056,0.4658,1.1486,7.4919,0.8606,6.9746,1.6719,0.6593,0.0039,1.2958,2.846,3.8856,0.0629,0.9681,4.3922,5.4708,1.5719,0.786,1.5207,6.2224,1.2941,3.5942,1.5181,0.2141,1.0623,1.7168,0.0435,1.5671,12.6392,3.5701,3.8642,7.0335,5.439,1.7778,0.2858,6.0742,5.5172,0.0497,0.8774,0.0028,3.5475,1.5486,0.0106,2.8379,1.1915,1.5252,0.3451,1.3948,1.7134,4.8096,0.4706,3.9038,0.429,4.2478,3.3837,3.2207,1.1159,1.7368,0.7556,0.7355,0.4954,1.4148,0.7415,0.0034,0.4096,2.6292,1.5692,0.2776,1.5117,3.3642,1.3949,1.5502,2.3779,0.5523,0.9497,8.5734,0.1317,1.5876,7.7311,0.0702,0.0434,3.3885,3.588,1.5868,6.0852,8.7377,1.9694,0.3649,0.5657,2.7433,5.1537,8.4278,0.596,1.6318,0.2918,2.7768,0.0005,0.0031,0.0013,1.6792,0.0124,0.0001,4.2291,1.2935,0.6108,4.6324,0.7316,1.3801,5.031,1.9731,0.1197,3.7817,0.9555,1.349,4.3887,4.5454,0.5886,0.0471,6.1029,2.1546,1.1144,2.5125,1.4549,0.769,4.6377,3.2289,2.2001,5.1925,0.1197,4.174,1.7905,1.5434,4.2611,5.1367,1.9175,4.4118,3.0861,1.7656,5.5629,5.1552,5.1236,5.8722,4.6133,0.0799,1.4605,6.5249,4.9537,2.36,2.3715,0.9289,4.6318,2.4602,1.0674,5.8985,0.336,5.0764,0.0426,4.8724,0.3054,2.1044,3.9018,0.873,0.8413,4.0491,0.1007,1.0181,3.5975,0.0005,0.0025,0.0028,1.4442,0.7334,0.0008,0.9073,0.3131,0.0761,4.0482,1.8935,2.6068,5.897,4.5764,0.5407,1.5766,1.166,0.0414,1.9698,2.1226,4.1433,0.1491,0.0079,0.0348,0.1211,3.3709,1.2839,0.5062,0.0209,1.494,1.9512,4.1231,1.7787,0.7468,0.983,2.8334,2.1758,4.5698,0.2746,3.3623,0.7311,0.0934,4.367,2.3002,1.4249,4.2956,0.339,4.7632,2.6931,2.4852,5.3645,1.5001,3.2174,0.0006,0.002,0.0028,5.1733,2.9344,5.0458,0.3596,6.4577,0.0006,0.0103,0.0019,5.6198,2.0174,0.6631,1.205,4.2717,0.0016,4.9324,1.7786,0.0179,2.6349,1.8001,0.9474,1.2015,3.5927,0.8412,5.8357,0.3492,4.2891,0.1398,4.1196,3.9422,0.1419,0.0157,2.4951,6.7194,0.0099,4.2736,1.3673,2.8358,2.1801,1.688,1.0794,3.9271,3.651,3.6141,1.6336,4.847,0.1779,1.9019,5.5927,0.1719,3.3923,4.8503,0.505,1.635,1.4709,2.4286,0.0099,3.1037,4.3151,2.2451,1.8659,1.8669,1.6194,3.1752,0.1587,3.757,1.2152,1.9684,3.8683,5.3896,0.0008,0.003,0.0114,2.7326,1.0707,3.1966,0.9244,5.9007,6.0233,5.8654,0.1318,4.7496,2.8823,0.2357,0.1213,1.0642,0.473,4.1483,0.3124,1.2774,2.521,8.255,0.1784,5.2376,1.8072,1.07,4.3613,1.1365,1.5083,0.9243,1.6036,1.4388,5.0277,5.9863,4.4644,4.6317,0.7916,4.4146,1.2775,5.4037,0.8947,1.3054,3.7666,0.0004,0.0021,0.0025,5.2982,2.6804,6.9647,6.1342,5.0063,0.9302,0.2579,1.7903,0.3913,3.2045,0.3157,0.6883,3.4462,3.8161,1.2268,0.6749,0.3568,3.203,0.1628,1.5256,3.0342,2.113,0.2956,1.5624,0.3193]}

In a statement the coast guard said the boat carrying around 230 people from a nearby small town had collided with a cargo vessel while it was heading to the island of Cebu on the coast of central Luzon, the country\u2019s largest island. The coast guard said it had responded to the report that the ferries was sinking after midnight and had rescued 252 people. No one was missing and all the dead bodies were recovered. The first report of the incident on Thursday night put the number of passengers taken aboard the boat at 300, but the coast guard said it now thought the number was around 230. Authorities said all the passengers and crew on board the two vessels were believed to be Filipino. The coast guard said rescue efforts had begun and teams had been called in from the neighboring islands of Negros, Cebu and Samar. A passenger on board one of the ferries, a local television station reported, described it as a \u201cvery dangerous and terrible accident\u201d during which \u201cwe\u2019re struggling for our lives \u201d.

But the North s warning, coming a week after an alleged atomic test, and the U.S. s warnings, and nuclear tests, it was not a sign of imminent war, Gabriel told reporters. It s a warning that if the U.S. keeps its threats up, we are prepared. We are ready for everything and all measures and counter-measures as well.\nPOTUS BACKED OFF MISSION TO KOREA: Trump backs off military mission to North Korea After the missile test last week,, the U.S. s military mission and Trump don t want to provoke the North Korea into war, Trump said. He s trying to keep his options open. This missile launch and tests in general show that this is now a very different situation in the Korean peninsula than it was when I came into office.\nPresident Trump has called on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and missiles programs that he said threaten the peace and security of the region and the world s nuclear non-proliferation regime. But analysts warned he s in danger of turning to retaliatory steps that can escalate confrontation in South Asia, and the entire Asia-Pacific region, which would jeopardize U.S. interests in North Korea, which is considered a key ally of the United States. Trump has also said that he wants to keep the current U.S. economic sanctions on North Korea intact, but there has been no indication that his administration is considering easing sanctions on North Korea. Diplomacy would be the best way to resolve the issue, said Robert Malley, a former official with the State Department who headed the U.S. s nuclear diplomacy team between 2006 and 2011. If the parties are not willing to use diplomacy to try to solve their differences, I think we would rethink whether it s worth the effort.","token_len":433,"entropy":[4.1926,7.607,4.1195,6.217,9.6836,1.0807,1.6344,1.727,0.2323,6.7842,0.2306,3.7636,8.0796,3.8874,1.2116,2.2495,8.9055,4.7336,3.3287,1.5892,4.1039,0.3908,6.7045,0.0028,0.0,0.3857,1.1693,2.0643,2.8296,3.2883,0.5753,0.1498,2.6275,5.7337,2.5264,0.4381,2.0196,0.0382,0.0013,1.1049,1.3692,0.225,14.1352,4.1699,4.0098,3.2486,1.4536,3.6778,2.1207,1.3363,1.9834,3.0466,5.7253,1.0513,5.5033,5.5179,0.0033,4.6452,5.3886,2.7943,5.9262,0.0013,0.2694,0.1153,2.6622,2.107,1.6945,4.242,1.7342,3.9334,9.9769,4.8207,3.6043,5.5106,3.4159,2.6522,0.2256,3.6149,4.4938,6.6092,0.6324,1.3282,5.2415,1.211,2.5285,0.0011,0.0775,0.1833,6.4433,4.424,1.5359,5.8886,7.9847,1.1841,1.058,7.1398,2.9948,2.1361,2.658,2.3606,0.5949,4.5317,1.2615,1.8374,1.666,2.0525,0.6632,1.1268,5.992,8.4363,1.8337,2.4955,1.6672,5.2625,1.0463,1.0363,0.0009,0.0049,0.0376,4.9212,1.2248,5.0211,4.1612,0.4604,6.2492,3.3671,4.7602,4.1931,4.8155,1.3691,2.0719,2.2065,7.1914,2.9262,4.1581,8.7248,3.7265,6.6214,3.2699,0.0396,4.8557,2.3604,1.1261,0.7702,6.8141,3.5291,10.8575,3.0373,4.8094,5.7316,3.7302,1.9141,2.7714,0.2671,0.0481,3.9845,3.4357,5.5149,0.3749,4.2225,0.3261,0.2292,3.5694,0.0506,6.1513,4.608,3.8648,0.4809,4.6868,0.473,9.9505,2.0031,1.6528,0.0008,0.0049,0.0288,7.8871,3.0396,3.423,6.4326,5.0274,8.5306,1.9769,2.2111,0.4172,5.0611,2.9147,0.4792,3.0973,6.1754,1.7234,1.4304,3.3288,1.3152,2.4374,3.4257,4.9742,6.7246,0.1186,3.3322,2.0107,3.494,0.106,1.9169,5.9996,6.3495,2.4042,3.9514,5.2994,3.8188,6.0568,5.404,1.1675,4.413,0.9528,6.2028,1.1586,2.3971,4.8218,1.2917,3.7072,1.1256,3.5896,1.1264,3.0357,1.31,0.4492,3.5442,4.0404,3.1914,1.8393,0.0628,0.6398,2.2819,4.0662,0.489,2.988,3.4945,1.9966,1.3164,0.1055,0.1642,3.4402,0.4001,0.966,1.784,2.4419,5.4279,3.94,5.1472,4.0804,1.189,4.4793,0.9324,4.1237,0.4091,0.5363,0.0341,0.2436,1.5502,2.1591,1.2756,0.99,9.4588,4.7255,5.454,0.5993,0.0192,0.0004,0.0,1.1685,0.5552,3.32,7.37,5.4763,4.0345,2.8182,5.1281,2.102,0.1177,3.8667,3.2051,8.1416,0.0269,5.0067,3.159,5.3385,2.7293,6.2092,3.4489,5.7042,5.2753,1.8981,2.8824,3.0391,6.5959,4.2088,0.1959,0.0031,0.5027,1.5915,3.5865,4.7941,5.7428,0.0195,1.9207,0.0008,0.0024,0.0848,1.621,2.001,4.7508,0.0412,2.6983,4.6205,1.5783,4.7422,0.8049,1.7429,0.9284,0.6888,0.7012,0.7754,0.0054,0.588,4.0148,1.9657,1.7507,2.0038,1.5527,1.2223,3.6579,0.502,3.2915,1.438,6.2962,1.7707,0.0009,0.0329,0.226,6.4447,0.6932,1.0142,0.825,0.0144,4.9886,1.2114,1.9103,4.4201,2.8464,0.1107,1.1011,2.1234,0.9,3.271,0.7613,1.3974,2.3272,4.4176,2.7013,1.4266,1.2222,0.0366,0.7094,8.3634,2.9402,5.0866,1.0443,2.5385,2.1782,1.1073,0.243,3.7031,1.0343,1.9195,0.8961,1.4962,4.4816,6.2481,1.3072,0.1317,0.9175,1.5438,5.0156,1.4311,0.1582,1.5185,0.0048,2.0843,5.3823,0.4324,2.1622,0.0007,0.2379,0.1749,8.1895,3.8802,4.4621,2.571,5.0193,3.0934,0.1457,2.0009,0.1693,5.2455,1.2235,8.8318,2.3727,1.4738,2.9146,0.0605,5.4004,3.3062,1.351,4.8817,0.1678,3.748,3.4226,0.4071,0.257,6.9591,0.9611,2.3745,1.9634,9.2323,4.3704,2.7455,6.0473,3.286,2.817,1.2819,0.9582]}

The soldiers had reportedly gone to search a house in the village of Soma in the area when the PKK militants opened fire from two vehicles and threw grenades at them. At first, the soldiers responded with gunfire and then later they opened up the fire from a machine gun, according to the Kurdish police sources. According to the sources, the PKK militants quickly escaped and made their way to a nearby mountainside. Official sources are still searching for the four PKK terrorists who were killed in this incident. According to the security sources, the incident did not cause any major problems in the area. Sources said that, according to the militants, this is only the start in the offensive in the province.\nSina Turk: Turkish forces fired mortars on the northern city of Alqosh, leaving more than 50 people dead. Witnesses said that at least fifty people were injured.\n\u201cAn Alqtash bombing with mortars and rockets killed 50 people and injured more than 50, as the civilian population is being driven away from their homes,\u201d said the OSDH. The reports also said that the situation in areas surrounding Aleppo is \u201ccritical.\u201d\nOne of the most striking examples of how far we've come is the rise in the popularity of YouTube vloggers; some of whom seem to be on the verge of earning their own prime-time television shows. So it's no surprise that a new generation of web videos are popping up that focus on celebrating the pleasures of being a dog. There is a site that is even dedicated to the whole phenomenon.\nThe concept works by creating a fun, quirky video about the pet owner and\/or his\/her dog, and then having it turned into a short form of video that pops up on one side of the screen, followed by an additional video that provides viewers with an \"overview\" of what that particular video is being about. The basic format is something like this:","token_len":434,"entropy":[9.139,1.6818,1.3926,1.038,3.4944,2.7842,0.3285,1.3275,2.2758,1.1057,1.6864,9.1394,0.2419,1.3799,0.2224,14.6218,0.2762,0.6437,6.1162,2.8392,0.2047,5.9563,1.8184,5.406,1.1482,4.3451,0.0471,5.0008,1.4254,0.8342,0.7436,3.9277,1.5796,0.1469,8.7042,11.0605,3.02,5.6656,5.228,0.0021,1.0193,4.9141,0.2316,2.872,3.7866,3.1927,4.4471,5.8657,0.843,5.0408,3.8339,2.8483,1.6772,0.6974,2.0009,0.2016,4.291,4.3894,2.2087,0.9539,4.3869,4.5369,1.6676,0.8423,0.9585,2.2417,0.0065,4.6033,4.6358,2.4544,2.7215,5.4933,2.2576,1.2513,0.4095,0.5785,4.938,7.0922,0.7564,0.8588,1.1817,5.1106,1.384,2.5001,1.7627,1.8492,6.7705,2.9875,3.0948,7.2553,2.0268,3.331,2.9509,2.1416,6.5733,0.0708,2.0186,2.7687,0.001,1.5253,3.4638,4.1327,4.9458,0.3301,4.4547,0.0009,0.8858,1.0506,0.0746,0.764,1.6388,0.4645,6.2634,6.496,2.0774,5.8579,0.557,0.0345,0.7515,1.9781,1.5889,7.0996,0.0436,1.4364,9.5673,0.9245,5.3063,2.4063,3.9979,0.279,0.361,5.3455,3.7131,4.2435,1.3487,0.859,0.6237,1.2693,4.3083,1.9277,0.3488,4.0369,0.0008,0.8615,5.0576,0.2712,0.0945,0.7677,4.3544,5.3176,0.0285,3.8076,0.3847,3.2868,2.4331,2.2687,0.5344,1.1229,0.9587,4.4784,1.5893,0.8666,4.9673,3.0835,0.0008,0.8298,5.935,0.405,4.8955,3.0089,4.1747,0.4579,3.3722,4.3338,0.7498,5.2625,3.5037,0.9973,4.9564,0.87,2.1568,6.5459,6.778,10.3316,3.5103,4.7361,2.9864,4.4852,5.1222,0.0093,2.7168,1.7253,5.6705,2.9491,0.0304,5.0671,6.5021,3.3608,1.9431,5.0856,4.1769,0.025,2.8054,1.9378,0.37,1.6499,6.3674,0.7633,0.8463,2.0369,0.1051,7.4572,1.8578,0.3381,1.2081,1.5931,1.7451,8.815,7.7506,6.4624,6.7147,9.272,4.8813,9.218,6.3378,3.4718,0.0046,2.5575,2.5414,3.5282,5.0155,0.3847,2.0024,0.8263,2.3172,0.0379,2.1737,2.3025,3.9982,2.7432,6.9628,1.6085,4.6,2.0794,5.0416,3.7471,0.795,1.0027,0.1205,1.7699,9.6894,7.643,3.3227,1.6487,8.9013,12.7524,1.4283,2.0708,5.9916,3.527,1.7402,0.2567,1.8763,5.3225,0.9285,5.5625,3.9227,6.1417,2.3639,14.1853,0.8747,5.9541,2.0964,2.802,1.7403,0.7251,6.1964,1.0869,0.1582,3.0981,4.7209,5.1701,0.2775,4.0628,5.6981,4.7415,1.7327,0.2925,2.3578,1.0613,5.3299,1.3526,1.5047,7.4678,0.0809,6.007,6.9934,0.0749,0.5426,7.2714,4.1436,0.9591,2.886,4.0287,0.3522,1.2496,4.2421,0.6045,1.2973,0.003,8.2469,1.6357,2.696,9.4572,1.8681,0.0214,3.5267,1.2659,0.7006,5.8057,3.4428,0.7062,1.5065,0.1524,0.1146,3.1695,3.4384,2.3877,0.0962,6.3032,4.5108,1.5879,1.7008,0.0043,4.5269,5.0639,0.2688,7.8613,1.127,8.3822,0.1412,4.1361,1.9992,7.3902,1.524,4.4966,2.0962,1.599,8.3582,2.8586,3.1594,5.6614,4.8758,0.0462,2.6,7.0148,5.401,1.7702,1.5578,2.6209,7.2446,7.2004,3.0547,3.4514,0.9496,6.1225,1.961,4.9752,1.5691,3.3454,2.1887,6.9397,4.5604,2.5832,6.8351,0.0007,2.775,2.2003,0.005,1.3135,1.8499,1.8734,0.8901,4.5578,1.827,6.3394,0.186,0.4361,4.983,5.8859,2.4524,3.0148,2.1292,7.6229,0.0968,1.2033,5.8101,4.332,0.3081,0.3037,0.7617,1.9226,4.397,0.0393,2.7018,5.1305,1.4803,1.7335,5.9376,5.3407,0.2176,2.0822,6.0238,4.6985,2.456,0.8823,0.201,2.2202,3.9393,3.828,2.2707,1.5234,6.092,5.4523,0.2287,1.9439,5.6651,5.706,0.9329,5.2529,0.396,0.2183,0.209]}

No immediate confirmation of that claim was available.\nThe Saudi-led coalition said it had launched air strikes Friday in response to what it called Houthi \"acts\", that included a rocket attack on a Saudi facility in eastern Saudi Arabia that it said killed a security guard.\nThe Houthis accuse the Saudi-led coalition of using U.S.-made weapons such as cluster bombs. The coalition denies the use of any chemical weapon, and a leading Houthi leader said on Saturday he was willing to meet for negotiation with the coalition.\nIt was the second air strike in a week on a Houthi militia base in Saudi Arabia without any immediate indication that it took down any weapons. A bomb struck the military base in southern Saudi Arabia on May 8, sparking a search for weapons reportedly hidden in the walls of a facility.\nBut on Wednesday, a U.S.-based monitor said at least one cluster bomb landed inside the facility, causing injuries to several people.\nThe U.S.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a research group, was the first to report a Houthi cluster bomb attack in the facility.\nA U.S. military official said on Thursday that he had information to suggest that the bomb had been dropped by the Saudis.","token_len":434,"entropy":[9.3891,3.8345,5.4998,0.7192,2.4168,3.4503,0.2074,6.9872,8.7354,1.6621,1.0449,6.5503,10.1829,8.6153,2.2843,0.9904,0.0162,2.3185,2.937,1.3094,4.2193,0.0035,1.9284,2.4964,1.7179,3.0476,2.9578,8.2825,4.3338,0.0046,2.1832,1.887,0.1045,4.3758,2.1078,1.9966,4.3235,0.7143,0.5023,0.0404,0.2156,5.2755,2.7104,0.044,0.9678,0.4818,0.2594,14.2302,3.6935,1.3726,5.3224,1.1329,5.8595,2.619,0.2567,6.4551,0.2987,0.0001,1.9578,1.4053,4.4621,4.0689,5.5807,5.3742,1.5062,1.6136,2.3764,4.9449,1.5053,8.0893,1.5484,2.457,5.8568,1.4342,1.9198,4.9146,0.0034,0.3573,2.4477,0.4385,5.8962,0.043,2.4263,5.6924,0.0047,5.793,7.4959,2.2783,0.9474,0.1607,2.4235,1.6872,1.3443,6.122,0.8289,1.1657,4.7113,8.0703,9.0118,3.8747,0.3216,5.3063,0.9893,3.9304,2.9209,1.2096,7.7357,3.3349,1.3222,1.0352,0.0093,0.0011,0.6423,1.8829,4.5351,0.3223,7.0711,3.683,6.2207,0.3483,5.8032,0.6848,0.3584,2.3265,1.0178,1.1871,2.3972,1.9589,0.0253,0.0347,0.0004,1.829,4.2408,1.821,4.8488,5.7252,1.1127,0.6621,3.2456,2.6278,1.5582,0.8697,0.3682,0.1572,3.9253,1.6925,0.8026,3.7527,2.5903,3.804,0.298,2.6916,0.0708,2.7741,3.4463,0.5975,1.4401,0.3405,0.0508,0.0838,0.1059,2.3016,3.7211,0.1819,1.8016,2.066,3.2083,1.8966,0.501,2.6465,2.3651,4.2969,5.514,5.0727,1.239,0.6764,3.3104,0.1624,0.0116,1.2534,7.4462,4.7798,4.897,0.5965,2.8437,0.7872,0.9685,1.9851,0.5355,0.1398,1.6488,2.4782,0.3638,0.0185,0.1494,2.2346,1.2123,0.9483,2.6071,2.6193,0.041,7.1116,2.0861,2.9436,0.0111,3.9718,0.1144,1.0824,4.6086,0.0792,2.9308,6.0664,6.2703,6.2427,2.3051,2.4931,4.3263,0.7508,0.7316,0.7046,2.5861,7.0033,1.2141,4.452,5.2977,0.0931,2.2729,4.3711,0.5071,2.4525,2.7815,4.8704,1.2194,0.8056,0.4698,1.5774,2.6635,0.2709,3.5023,0.4382,0.9904,0.4352,0.0202,0.0511,0.0502,0.8976,7.3552,0.0039,0.2492,0.1117,1.288,2.5297,4.1019,0.0015,1.6349,0.9201,3.7488,1.8834,1.4019,3.2776,1.8585,5.3999,0.1355,3.7903,2.3361,3.3855,1.8575,1.4401,3.89,7.005,1.6258,0.0139,4.0895,1.8189,2.0157,0.738,2.2121,1.5691,4.3217,0.0079,3.3218,6.7168,8.6998,0.9238,0.6427,1.0441,1.0403,0.2266,5.3585,1.9035,2.0242,1.6497,4.4708,0.1388,2.0585,1.9857,0.7703,2.4351,1.9639,3.3223,0.0032,5.5216,1.1663,0.4522,4.1501,0.0394,7.8385,1.8098,3.7611,4.7671,1.3152,1.2892,7.538,4.4851,2.5235,3.3334,0.611,3.2764,5.6726,3.4687,1.5812,4.1393,1.0635,1.1169,4.2365,2.5989,0.0161,0.7042,3.4813,3.5279,0.5901,5.2811,1.0025,7.6566,1.6234,1.7542,8.3055,4.3784,0.7323,1.1429,4.9226,0.7007,1.9452,4.3095,0.96,0.4898,4.2259,2.9436,4.2968,0.3705,1.8918,3.4958,0.0005,0.1341,0.3579,3.8498,4.9067,1.1719,4.2702,0.0013,2.5819,5.7562,0.2125,5.8479,4.3083,1.0353,3.1794,1.1061,3.9346,5.1953,1.2243,3.0594,1.5457,0.9674,0.8874,1.645,2.7248,0.0007,0.0318,0.7733,3.5412,3.0448,0.0322,0.0189,0.0005,0.0018,1.5293,1.3417,5.7898,0.5157,1.3402,7.2045,2.907,0.1033,0.3633,0.4478,3.4534,3.6672,0.0039,6.5546,0.1471,1.8338,1.5374,1.5576,9.5578,1.2575,0.8115,3.0241,2.1098,0.0005,0.1724,1.0838,1.9713,1.1162,0.909,1.9299,2.2431,0.4053,4.4735,1.0161,6.6347,5.0219,2.02,0.7806,1.257,4.0721,1.3797,0.5864,1.3582,1.0089,2.1044,4.7972,1.1612]}

Meanwhile, higher-income taxpayers could see new tax breaks on their tax returns.\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s up now? It\u2019s a tax audit,\u201d said Jack Houghton, CEO of the Tax Foundation. \u201cTheir motivation is money. To them, you know, the IRS is a business.\u201d\nThe IRS announced its plans Friday to launch what it called an \u201cearnings tax audit\u201d under the proposed tax cut bill, an action it said comes in response to concerns from taxpayers who say the IRS is not doing enough to track down tax evaders.\nThe IRS said it would audit about a million taxpayers to find out if they might have withheld more taxes. The agency said this year it sent out 1.7 million letter requests for tax information while auditing 1 million taxpayers. The IRS began a \u201chotline\u201d where taxpayers can call 1-800-872-0471 to volunteer information about alleged tax violations.\nThe IRS began sending in audits on Friday for some of the biggest corporate taxpayers and wealthy individuals and is expected to issue about 400 IRS letters \u2014 mostly requesting income or withholding information \u2014 to big business executives before the end of the year. It will also release tax information early for about 900 taxpayers who had reported income of more than $50 million or $50 million and less in combined income, reported the IRS.\nThe IRS said it would use the letters to ask taxpayers who have reported income or withheld taxes to confirm and update information, and it will conduct extensive research to determine whether any taxpayers might have reported income or withheld taxes that were not lawfully required in a previous year.","token_len":434,"entropy":[10.532,2.3804,5.9087,0.0379,2.8993,4.8622,4.5295,4.9599,5.7958,7.296,0.0473,0.0033,0.0265,5.6496,7.0281,0.294,2.611,2.62,6.187,0.3846,1.3033,9.5883,2.4528,5.6877,5.5758,0.01,0.1937,5.8224,1.2459,7.6518,5.9654,0.2978,2.0179,4.8512,7.4491,1.6721,1.7224,3.3819,2.2489,4.1444,8.4451,0.0222,1.3614,1.9533,1.6483,4.1689,0.1412,0.6485,0.2078,15.2401,4.3806,1.8511,2.6614,1.8711,1.0089,3.059,5.9193,1.9178,1.6147,0.1046,0.0443,0.2136,15.0658,7.4905,4.0869,1.2448,0.0027,0.039,0.0008,0.01,0.5331,10.8462,7.4821,7.0502,0.7578,7.061,0.3089,1.5199,4.2434,2.8448,6.2381,0.0243,3.1585,1.744,3.7343,0.0279,1.5225,0.2348,0.0333,2.8923,0.0006,0.3006,1.6722,5.1694,1.4577,1.4763,7.1921,0.0207,6.0194,0.7884,0.1939,0.5355,3.0847,2.5044,6.4855,1.8793,2.3997,4.0884,1.0433,2.7574,0.2977,1.4531,0.3326,6.1833,1.8988,6.9167,4.6655,2.017,10.0107,8.822,5.2838,5.1849,5.7329,0.4869,3.3356,4.2931,3.7117,0.666,2.7549,2.5986,7.971,3.1068,3.5166,1.9938,3.8777,5.8899,4.7507,4.1267,0.2177,0.104,4.7516,0.1248,1.2374,0.7713,0.5638,1.0165,5.4527,0.4265,7.6441,7.7034,0.9865,5.6125,1.003,5.6973,5.3478,0.101,4.4313,2.8633,0.6954,2.6242,4.7038,1.1555,2.4834,4.6955,1.1198,3.7198,2.5977,0.8925,2.3126,4.3169,5.5205,3.1208,3.9507,5.1739,1.2486,4.8743,5.8931,0.6021,1.047,1.9375,6.6795,0.3822,6.8817,1.5189,1.8946,1.2375,4.296,0.3512,5.7192,0.562,4.5404,1.891,5.9502,2.7808,1.7601,5.2441,4.2513,3.0122,1.3131,6.0593,2.6469,0.5435,0.0034,2.4215,2.2125,4.125,1.6096,1.8351,0.8288,2.3683,1.0265,3.0433,1.4832,0.2835,0.1146,4.9475,1.685,2.6613,2.3389,0.0032,0.499,0.4304,1.7451,2.4843,2.0317,0.8996,2.2061,3.8334,3.8338,4.4304,2.1325,1.812,3.8979,2.7077,1.1349,1.5533,0.6294,6.7973,1.1369,5.9407,2.5297,4.5663,1.9212,1.8597,2.3002,1.4625,5.0031,2.4948,1.6572,6.0505,1.6756,4.279,1.0625,2.6435,0.0209,4.7958,3.3302,1.2977,2.5653,1.6886,6.983,4.7261,0.0343,2.1708,2.195,2.2939,0.784,2.4218,1.4179,5.8018,4.2238,8.8258,0.1298,10.7893,1.7393,0.3602,0.8671,5.3708,1.9279,0.2534,2.5022,1.7237,0.0454,0.6906,0.0116,3.2155,4.0548,0.0083,4.3803,4.453,1.0018,8.4081,1.3827,1.3438,5.8091,0.2919,4.1953,0.3799,0.3595,1.7714,1.5968,4.7267,3.8563,5.6435,6.2154,2.972,2.8854,3.7547,4.8048,2.2555,0.4095,2.955,5.4927,4.6842,3.3114,5.6957,0.6235,4.2203,4.5566,2.0849,0.0063,2.6892,3.9619,4.0581,6.2878,2.1082,7.466,3.9295,6.4173,5.6427,4.7027,5.4234,0.2987,0.8943,2.6392,6.843,2.5572,3.646,5.0679,0.9382,1.427,0.0009,0.6094,0.3659,0.3583,4.1466,2.361,0.6882,3.993,2.7667,1.9298,7.2948,3.1176,4.8507,4.8885,4.2462,1.2712,4.4798,3.9743,3.1108,3.6621,1.112,0.0043,0.019,3.6536,1.0624,2.3975,3.9887,2.9982,0.251,4.0774,5.0702,5.833,8.1057,1.7687,2.7733,6.0649,1.4756,0.653,0.9238,0.259,1.5957,1.2546,1.3641,0.8258,2.4448,3.8753,1.5586,3.7435,0.3865,4.4724,3.2898,3.1212,2.0615,1.8935,1.3347,3.0458,2.2924,3.187,0.765,6.5195,5.2056,2.963,2.9413,3.2861,1.8189,2.6473,1.3024,4.8139,6.357,4.0851,1.1048,1.186,1.5684,3.1831,2.4746,4.2115,0.5167,2.7461,1.1467,1.0868,0.4058,1.1085,4.6624,1.8491,1.366,8.7822,3.8924,3.833,4.0256,2.2224,1.0764,0.2576]}

Lee is expected to meet senior defence advisers on the sidelines of a three-day defence exercise in the western part of Jeju Island.\nUS officials see a crucial test of South Korea\u2019s capacity to keep peace with North Korea and to respond quickly to an escalation by the North, with China - the ultimate target of tensions with Pyongyang - the most insulated from the risks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be moving to the point where we\u2019re imposing significant new sanctions, because that will be a mistake,\u201d said White House spokesman Scott Stanzel, referring to the fact that Chinese officials had suggested during the weekend that US sanctions could be waived without further provocation from Beijing.\nThe Trump administration has also been focusing on pressing China for sanctions against senior Chinese officials linked to the Hong Kong unrest.\nThe White House is not expecting changes in the Trump administration\u2019s policy towards Hong Kong, but the pressure has intensified in recent weeks.\nOn Monday, the White House said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the severity of the violence in Hong Kong.","token_len":435,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,4.4868,9.4708,0.097,0.4966,4.3676,0.1778,6.4771,1.2245,2.094,2.3179,0.6977,5.0451,1.3672,1.9199,1.4463,0.0776,1.8867,6.4362,6.9224,1.4492,0.312,3.6796,1.2139,1.4969,0.7766,2.1432,0.4918,0.0056,5.6098,4.1635,6.9686,2.118,0.0576,0.3014,2.1421,4.3453,1.2739,0.9019,12.6099,0.0187,0.9348,0.2969,18.1253,4.9796,2.8167,0.0368,1.9627,0.0073,6.0042,1.8659,2.4353,3.2539,0.0003,0.0002,1.6652,2.7535,1.4977,0.2584,1.7039,4.3921,0.0005,5.2363,1.8185,3.7557,0.0095,5.0325,7.2572,3.6966,3.579,1.5341,1.122,1.3486,2.8086,0.7531,4.7989,0.597,0.7797,0.3891,1.925,2.9182,0.0012,2.5486,1.649,5.2288,0.7197,2.7527,0.8494,3.2998,5.189,4.7997,2.021,2.4027,1.9501,3.5199,3.0604,4.2312,1.9674,1.7334,5.9708,0.1503,5.2482,2.4562,4.5751,1.7211,2.5888,0.6542,2.3757,2.9408,4.5639,2.7129,3.3971,0.3016,1.2752,7.4374,2.8853,0.4592,2.287,3.7638,1.0249,2.5172,4.1199,6.2891,0.5151,3.4915,2.7818,3.359,0.3725,2.0428,5.1157,0.7975,3.1032,0.2727,0.2276,3.2636,1.6542,4.7136,0.0039,4.5586,3.0765,3.0666,1.1276,3.5963,2.7656,2.8662,0.6621,1.2497,2.7673,0.5048,3.046,4.9339,5.2282,1.8232,0.5106,1.6101,2.2361,7.7954,1.4153,3.3385,7.3269,0.0977,1.0674,4.6266,0.1509,5.8753,0.9439,0.4578,4.026,3.0459,5.0174,0.1609,2.5219,0.2702,2.4615,3.2702,0.3456,4.9264,0.0032,1.048,14.3948,0.0709,5.4852,1.0846,1.0834,2.1042,4.7709,0.6532,3.5462,2.3751,8.9497,0.0193,1.6181,1.3656,0.6298,1.4898,4.5224,0.6056,4.1093,0.339,5.8683,7.9235,0.4225,0.2163,5.2297,5.3113,3.059,0.124,1.1141,8.482,2.2914,1.5245,5.8867,2.7466,1.9871,0.024,2.4642,4.575,7.0245,6.8578,2.9349,3.2739,0.9981,0.1598,1.7211,4.9735,0.0631,0.0642,6.1523,5.4672,1.2964,1.6211,4.9664,2.6165,0.0006,10.7296,0.0023,1.4363,1.238,0.2244,5.5487,2.37,5.7328,2.4818,6.0533,4.065,0.8731,4.2989,0.4624,17.2697,8.218,4.0544,4.969,0.1359,5.0742,6.7457,1.2281,1.2232,0.0438,2.83,3.5484,4.6413,3.9942,0.8048,4.3355,3.6624,2.7377,1.3136,0.7855,1.9011,3.3449,4.088,6.4138,1.8849,6.833,3.1081,0.9095,6.5803,2.4879,1.7917,0.091,4.853,2.5863,10.9473,2.169,1.6752,4.8127,0.815,0.3928,7.7069,4.4078,9.0567,8.0243,5.9018,4.3266,2.8233,1.2894,0.0746,2.5792,6.4307,3.273,1.8977,5.4783,0.5243,0.5433,2.9921,1.1975,1.9098,6.2803,6.3778,2.9069,0.5572,2.7201,3.3504,2.2061,4.0423,1.4818,1.7837,3.9475,1.6643,4.5454,8.5873,1.6212,3.7189,0.0035,1.3565,7.1073,10.1291,7.4197,2.4909,3.4855,0.0725,1.1474,4.9435,0.1458,5.2871,2.0005,2.6502,4.1431,5.6581,0.8832,3.7801,0.2333,3.9924,1.7677,1.9804,0.4167,6.6065,3.6003,2.9714,5.1557,4.4581,2.1044,0.2892,0.2937,1.9699,3.925,0.2014,1.3564,2.5709,1.6371,6.4053,0.3985,5.7897,1.1217,2.7107,5.1837,0.9598,8.9863,2.8484,0.2759,6.1935,0.085,1.0362,7.9424,0.0116,5.7661,1.2362,0.9362,1.8787,2.8713,0.0015,1.9361,3.6439,4.1726,7.0393,0.9217,1.6175,5.5135,0.1152,5.1503,0.5191,0.2228,2.4059,1.7168,4.0379,0.002,0.9815,2.5949,2.8247,6.1691,2.8339,3.698,2.1705,0.1252,1.0105,1.5692,1.0492,2.9833,1.7306,0.2372,1.4661,2.6466,0.0017,2.2254,1.0057,1.324,13.1594,0.9399,5.3638,0.0023,0.4944,1.6419,4.1174,1.3642,1.0104,7.3019,0.0591,0.6428,4.0221,0.4795,0.5698,0.0012,2.2281]}
{"prompt":"The Trump administration and major U.S. states appear to be headed for a showdown over landmark rules aimed at doubling the fuel efficiency of vehicles sold in the United States . At an Environmental Protection","text":"The Trump administration and major U.S. states appear to be headed for a showdown over landmark rules aimed at doubling the fuel efficiency of vehicles sold in the United States. At an Environmental Protection Agency meeting in Atlanta last week, state officials objected to limits on what they say is a major policy failure and demanded greater flexibility in the rules. \u201cThis is the worst-case possible outcome on this issue,\u201d Illinois Department of Agriculture Director Jeff Williams told reporters, saying that the restrictions would require significant changes to how cars are shipped from foreign auto assembly plants. \u201cWe\u2019re going into November, and we are at another stalemate,\u201d he said. According to the EPA, the next round of rules, which the agency unveiled in October, would limit vehicle fuel economy to about 54 miles per gallon by 2022\u2013a figure that is lower than the 45 miles per gallon requirement for 2012 cars and trucks already under consideration. Critics said the new rules would discourage consumers from buying vehicles that produce lower carbon emissions, thereby hurting the nation\u2019s climate goals. They also said they would hinder innovation and would force the EPA to raise vehicle fuel economy standards for the first time since a 1999 rule. The new rules were meant to come into effect in January, but EPA officials said that would remain moot because of the ongoing opposition because the rule would likely force the agency to modify the 2012 rules and release them as a compromise between states pushing higher vehicle fuel economy standards and automakers lobbying to avoid them. The administration said more clarity on the next round of rules was available at the time. \u201cFor the next version of rules, it\u2019s clear what the plan is and there will be no more stalemates,\u201d EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told reporters Friday in Seattle. The plan allows for a number of options, such as extending the current 12-month review period for the rules to 2015 and increasing flexibility for states that want to allow their regulations to take effect earlier than 2022; both requests are popular among states that want to ease the impacts of stricter vehicle fuel economy standards.

A final status agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, with permanent physical and territorial status, and Jerusalem as the capital of two states -- Palestine and Israel -- remains the only viable basis for achieving just and lasting peace,\u201d said the UN chief.\nThe UN peacemaker in the territory had urged an end to violence after two weeks of violence that has killed at least 40 Palestinians, most of them civilians; and 25 Israelis, most of them members law-enforcement and security forces.\nThe most significant development in the conflict of last two weeks was the killing of seven Hamas gunmen in Israel on December 30, a U.S. military official told Reuters in a statement released late on Wednesday after a U.S. military council meeting in Washington. The official also said that Israel has launched several airstrikes in Gaza.\n\"There are no military operations in Gaza at this time,\" said a spokesman in Israeli defense minister Avigdor Lieberman's office.\nAt the start of the violent conflict, Israel said rocket fire from Gaza had reached the Israeli high school in Sderot, near the border, but later in the day said that Israel was taking no action against suspected Palestinian militants.\nA Palestinian official on Wednesday said that rocket fire has now slowed down. However, a Hamas spokesman said he expected rocket fire from Gaza to resume.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman warned the Arab world on Thursday at its annual meeting in Kuwait of the danger to the region of \"Islamic terrorism and bloodshed\" unless Palestinian and Israeli sides work together to end the violence.\n(Additional reporting by Ronit Pinhas, Avi Issacharoff, Ramzy Natshe, Alastair Maclean, Eilon Shahar Editing by Jane Merriman and Alexander Smith)","token_len":436,"entropy":[7.8974,4.1936,0.8292,0.0021,3.1969,0.0043,0.0001,0.0003,2.0155,1.854,1.994,0.7671,4.0132,1.1549,1.0731,5.3879,0.5004,1.966,4.5961,0.0274,0.5024,0.0293,5.1511,1.4324,0.0138,0.5239,0.0791,3.152,1.2635,5.3949,1.4595,2.1938,4.885,5.6852,0.144,3.2108,3.3471,2.5849,0.3811,1.0938,2.3375,5.0228,0.2179,0.6865,0.1854,10.1093,6.3051,4.0283,0.488,7.9234,3.8043,3.1002,0.3194,1.0996,3.3846,0.0011,4.7752,3.9673,1.3088,0.8561,1.5661,0.2495,1.5388,1.4571,0.9109,2.5062,0.3375,0.1917,1.8995,0.9868,1.4912,0.9345,4.1168,3.6559,3.9131,0.027,4.637,3.5306,0.7772,2.2989,3.7607,3.5248,5.2051,4.4003,2.8984,2.318,2.1352,3.0357,0.0422,0.2582,2.9842,3.4667,7.6341,8.0783,1.771,4.8076,3.0297,0.6381,4.0598,5.1758,0.5229,0.9411,0.9038,0.5504,5.1852,0.2678,6.8656,5.1732,0.1151,0.357,0.2633,5.1522,1.2401,0.7226,1.0057,6.6559,0.233,4.0267,6.4355,1.1092,0.5516,0.0236,3.2614,15.2559,9.1759,3.6084,2.537,0.6684,3.9737,0.3571,0.1643,1.7842,3.1209,11.6771,0.4752,4.2082,2.2832,9.2358,4.7447,3.6969,4.5117,1.7747,0.0024,2.0542,3.9981,3.3699,2.7619,0.1148,2.6071,2.1977,2.2183,0.8502,2.1881,0.0002,4.0342,0.7783,1.1477,2.8723,0.1769,0.0471,0.9027,6.1465,2.7884,8.6746,1.1144,1.7425,1.403,0.1413,0.0639,6.117,15.7738,5.1366,1.8092,3.7515,1.3628,1.9519,0.9017,0.5605,1.7496,6.6185,4.2997,4.2174,1.9163,0.5023,2.7638,6.018,3.0448,3.4809,1.5495,1.802,0.6926,3.6024,0.227,3.8498,5.6525,2.5904,1.2766,4.1757,2.6959,5.0315,4.0178,1.0872,3.0747,6.6059,0.0021,0.8336,0.3264,1.839,0.8999,1.8206,1.4428,3.3651,1.5927,1.6762,4.3504,2.1915,0.5327,0.5433,5.2768,2.2543,2.5322,0.0006,0.2665,0.1892,1.4539,8.082,0.6445,1.3209,2.507,0.5985,1.8367,2.2319,4.0231,0.5032,1.1768,3.0528,2.9126,3.66,3.8437,2.7758,1.7942,1.1523,2.753,0.3335,2.7613,3.133,1.7243,1.2677,4.4103,3.6786,1.245,0.9143,3.5262,0.4734,0.2499,0.8067,2.0291,3.3501,4.3492,4.6612,5.0217,3.7723,3.3611,1.4828,0.005,0.0,0.1344,0.0445,0.1329,0.6583,0.698,5.283,1.3406,4.7517,0.0059,0.619,7.4549,1.9126,0.6674,2.0004,3.5203,7.2637,0.5117,0.6557,0.3264,1.9905,4.5119,1.2995,2.4786,6.973,5.8404,1.9206,5.9536,0.0226,0.0,0.9914,4.7109,0.6799,1.5942,4.2989,3.9591,4.2604,5.4297,0.1802,0.2708,2.7063,2.1996,4.1028,2.0986,4.3925,3.5727,0.5617,2.1433,7.4179,4.3434,0.5966,0.614,0.5999,3.395,1.889,1.7701,3.9016,0.8016,0.8835,1.1729,4.5854,0.1535,5.6346,4.4624,6.0179,1.3854,2.4728,5.2799,0.0458,3.0855,3.8183,1.2056,1.1367,3.8739,3.8596,2.258,0.2927,1.1093,0.5001,0.2816,2.3537,3.1958,0.4105,3.6439,3.2755,0.0603,0.9749,0.0053,0.0001,0.0077,5.4558,3.2093,6.5901,1.05,1.3205,2.6149,5.9785,6.596,2.4347,1.3404,1.5802,5.2953,5.3742,1.5686,3.0354,4.2082,1.5939,2.0236,2.4105,2.644,6.1977,1.0489,3.2702,5.7446,1.3963,5.9731,4.7534,4.2885,0.6196,4.0393,3.7645,0.7256,0.6506,1.2963,0.5302,1.3101,0.3731,0.3518,3.0366,2.1907,0.0062,0.0242,5.3341,6.336,12.0355,4.4305,2.0231,6.4149,1.1758,7.2294,0.2498,0.0028,3.6268,0.775,5.6476,3.7502,4.5408,6.8857,2.696,3.5341,4.6592,2.6845,0.0052,4.1281,4.826,1.0448,5.5101,10.3691,11.1764,5.1251,13.9874,0.0424,6.4685,6.0974,1.5279,0.0058,1.1777,6.5714,4.4446,0.1671]}

Because, as I stated earlier, it\u2019s a whole lot of hokey talk that will most likely do nothing but hurt American and global automakers, and Americans\u2019 ability to have cars.\nLarson and Smith have already introduced a bill that would, if passed, make it easier for automakers to comply with their federal fuel efficiency requirements while also removing a provision that is likely to hurt vehicle sales on the United States market.\nLarson\u2019s bill would make the rule under which automakers must improve fuel-efficiency of new cars to meet the government\u2019s goal of a 25-percent decrease, in line with federal law, as well as a 10-percentage-point increase for older cars more easily affordable, if that automaker chooses to take advantage of it.\nSmith\u2019s bill would remove \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 some of the provisions in the federal rule under which automakers must increase gasoline content in vehicles by 20 percent in the United States.\nThe Trump Administration is trying to change the rules on gasoline content, but the automakers don\u2019t want to, making these rules more complex and harder to fulfill than ever.","token_len":436,"entropy":[11.9207,7.2645,0.1156,8.2142,1.4368,3.1018,0.6843,0.3878,2.4387,3.3425,1.3769,0.6658,0.2635,5.1253,0.0541,5.5103,0.0458,1.5598,3.5304,1.6592,3.2582,1.7642,3.929,3.1492,5.8297,0.0496,4.2229,9.8044,0.0278,2.8937,3.2841,3.1974,6.1475,5.7488,0.5412,0.5841,0.0166,1.8863,2.5361,7.1828,2.2165,2.3688,7.6982,2.3834,0.11,0.227,0.2196,16.8005,15.9007,8.7572,1.5478,6.1883,4.0739,7.3596,3.8009,2.8822,3.7145,2.3073,5.5175,5.7761,3.4466,1.696,2.8176,2.1509,5.7243,5.6681,0.5518,0.0413,4.0005,3.3668,5.0758,0.1445,1.5989,5.8275,4.5832,3.1121,0.0415,0.1246,4.3976,6.3499,1.3113,5.8277,1.0362,3.3289,3.8724,0.4105,3.1326,2.8632,1.6757,0.3727,3.9238,0.5377,0.0449,4.2678,2.2758,2.834,0.7407,0.672,0.0015,0.5027,0.4508,4.7376,2.4759,0.9597,1.2431,2.3414,5.2296,2.2172,0.1549,0.0442,0.1857,2.3135,1.3052,4.5408,4.8481,7.1439,8.8826,0.2811,0.0014,14.5619,5.3898,6.1017,5.7134,3.1517,7.0685,10.8764,1.2865,11.6737,0.8618,2.2193,6.4445,2.1068,5.3864,3.036,1.6584,3.0016,2.7361,4.7292,6.6479,0.0513,6.7999,0.016,0.3218,0.1577,2.8031,3.3339,3.7316,3.449,5.3186,2.4465,0.7678,1.5781,2.0167,1.927,0.352,0.4256,4.5515,3.3597,2.5795,1.9947,5.3786,1.6935,6.7984,0.1401,9.6901,0.0632,11.8002,2.869,2.52,0.1102,3.3143,2.7323,1.0528,0.003,3.9622,3.1823,0.0416,4.8053,1.7558,5.4149,1.9472,2.7852,0.0178,4.8095,2.4181,1.2111,0.0097,4.2691,0.0129,0.405,1.8886,0.9311,1.6943,5.2147,0.6627,0.5448,0.0369,4.0249,2.8717,1.061,0.7168,5.657,2.4158,2.4414,1.9409,3.9418,2.153,0.4417,2.4249,1.3809,0.4748,0.005,1.7735,4.505,0.6807,1.1797,6.7078,2.4436,0.0021,3.4973,2.9873,3.9243,5.7893,0.1754,5.9209,1.3731,2.3762,2.9494,2.2113,6.7444,3.2835,2.41,2.359,1.5812,7.1677,3.6926,0.2106,15.4709,0.0407,5.866,4.9872,2.5434,0.3025,5.0708,0.0505,2.381,1.4735,2.616,3.1238,2.8641,1.2246,0.3778,0.9792,0.283,4.8959,2.1953,0.7618,0.1735,2.3041,0.3642,0.8094,0.1332,0.6933,0.0818,0.5077,0.0113,6.1559,1.243,1.1137,0.0633,0.6186,5.2366,1.3415,5.1618,2.751,2.837,0.5022,4.5719,4.9501,0.1131,3.4267,7.9262,2.1741,6.1735,0.7572,5.2038,0.0049,1.1366,0.4471,0.803,3.3613,0.0607,1.4536,0.0492,0.1719,0.9076,1.6038,2.4199,3.9305,4.7064,7.6656,2.2431,1.9239,2.0688,5.7076,1.6182,4.6267,0.7204,5.5154,4.689,1.7212,3.0317,2.4211,1.8942,4.4315,4.2069,0.2384,0.1017,1.8557,0.4304,4.5889,4.0661,2.8245,0.2446,4.3418,5.4426,4.5616,2.365,0.0035,4.3858,2.1647,0.9686,4.1912,2.191,0.0174,2.3344,3.3888,0.627,0.0645,8.7964,0.5072,0.037,1.3077,1.7995,5.1067,0.8354,8.3796,6.3651,8.7262,3.2339,4.3317,3.2928,5.0199,0.0006,4.1767,0.1953,4.8339,2.2934,0.0182,3.7837,0.2333,0.4498,2.6538,0.1966,0.0136,0.0771,0.2593,0.8091,4.4928,8.7302,3.4522,1.1931,0.9309,0.2794,4.7229,0.4991,0.1986,4.2558,2.2122,0.5318,2.73,1.3309,5.9942,0.0486,0.7584,0.7768,3.8185,4.4822,7.6187,1.9402,3.0342,2.1346,2.2099,0.2892,2.9658,2.9733,2.4914,0.0023,1.6884,0.9656,2.4684,4.602,3.1573,1.9559,3.9985,0.1591,4.3108,1.5541,1.6462,2.5399,4.0348,4.5306,2.3515,1.5823,2.3295,4.6778,3.4526,0.6329,0.6467,0.2508,1.3938,0.6224,4.4943,6.7062,4.9667,2.3245,2.7447,4.5414,0.9508,3.7284,0.295,7.2103,3.1459,3.9685,1.8938]}

At a time when the world faces the worst pandemic in living memory, the United Nations Security Council\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Committee has warned that many countries have fallen back during the pandemic on their efforts to combat terrorism. The report issued at the close of its six-month review of terrorist financing in the region said that while most Member States continued to pursue anti-money-laundering legislation and measures for terrorist financing, many of them had fallen behind in preventing groups from laundering and financing their activities as COVID-19-related lockdowns and other restrictions took over many states.

{"prompt":"U.S . Senator Susan Collins of Maine , a moderate Republican who helped block her party \u2019 s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year , said she planned to remain in her","text":"U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican who helped block her party \u2019 s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year, said she planned to remain in her seat, where she now leads the Republican majority by 13 points. \u201d This is a moment to reflect on what we are collectively doing as a country, \u201d Collins said on Twitter. \u201d Our health is at stake. Our economy is at stake. And we have this opportunity to move forward. \u201d On Wednesday night, the Senate voted 54-22 to give final approval to the measure, the first step in what is expected to be a two-week long roll. The Senate has been working overtime to finish up the health care repeal and replace legislation, and it needs 60 votes on the floor to pass the measure. If that happens, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the nation \u2019 s top Republican, has said that the final bill will be sent to President Trump to sign into law. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida and Chris Collins of Georgia have also indicated that they plan to stick with their GOP colleagues in the House, at least for now. Even if some of these Republicans back out in the near future, the measure has a high likelihood of winning a final vote. The bill, called the Health Care Reform Enforcement and Accountability Act, would give taxpayers more rights when it comes to their Obamacare coverage, it would allow insurers to appeal court decisions against them if they are found liable by the taxpayers, and most importantly, it would prohibit states from imposing mandates on healthcare providers, whether they belong to a private insurance or public plan, and prohibit subsidies from government aid for care. HealthCare.gov has received over 2.2 million applications for the annual exchange open-enrollment period, and one analyst estimates that about 12.1 million people, or almost 40% of the population, will have the chance to enrol in the annual open-enrollment period, which ends later next week. But some Republicans said that it will be difficult to make the changes in just 10 days as the legislation faces an obstacle in the Democratic-held U.S. House of Representatives.","token_len":437,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.3359,4.7595,0.0173,2.1019,0.003,1.1824,2.5533,3.1821,0.5265,1.815,5.1897,5.3562,6.2164,3.4412,18.9605,7.9257,7.3956,3.1259,0.0563,1.7678,1.3233,0.2671,0.001,0.0016,6.0967,0.4901,0.7045,1.3597,1.8067,6.1856,0.059,5.9098,1.1634,2.6433,1.8876,2.7561,3.3928,0.401,5.5611,3.7794,1.2487,2.5825,4.1658,5.6741,5.4001,0.5226,0.3421,6.7536,6.8417,5.6213,1.6471,1.4323,4.476,2.4992,2.9856,0.3078,2.0252,1.8172,2.69,7.5816,1.3598,2.7829,0.4111,1.0616,1.4913,7.3072,3.1543,9.4592,0.3738,3.4846,2.9674,0.3808,2.5994,0.3399,4.568,4.3496,6.8655,3.2046,0.3808,0.8336,2.5499,3.1926,0.2235,0.256,0.1046,0.1458,2.0442,1.6865,2.309,5.7387,2.545,0.4352,3.5833,0.5207,1.7368,1.5921,0.3589,4.866,3.6762,2.6957,0.2294,2.5522,1.304,1.8458,4.7314,0.3175,4.7886,0.19,5.5488,4.3877,0.9398,0.657,0.8758,4.6701,2.1069,4.2987,1.181,2.4587,0.8261,5.1823,2.1254,0.8156,0.0059,0.0358,0.3217,4.7411,0.0321,1.1459,4.9526,4.8118,6.6432,1.7288,2.8711,2.9091,2.6863,3.0145,4.4046,0.4703,4.5843,3.6898,0.5762,3.3366,0.3278,3.7631,2.9452,0.2946,1.9772,1.6139,1.7011,2.5246,4.7349,2.1151,0.0509,4.5267,1.0423,1.9804,0.4365,1.32,1.7819,1.5726,0.4709,3.704,3.5856,0.9667,0.1183,4.5875,0.8863,0.0434,0.2306,0.0003,1.8137,3.2279,4.1873,11.2799,2.3721,2.2835,2.272,0.5436,0.6743,2.787,1.9281,2.5624,1.8512,4.1125,2.3846,1.5834,1.2193,2.6748,0.2426,1.5822,1.3354,2.9353,0.9808,3.0748,0.0015,0.5596,10.713,0.0404,6.703,0.4359,0.0117,0.6736,0.0142,1.326,4.253,1.0558,0.1959,5.2494,2.3891,2.1062,2.8899,0.839,0.1157,2.1244,0.0474,5.5868,0.6636,1.0997,5.8505,0.6735,2.1193,0.7209,1.6326,1.7688,6.2843,0.3015,1.8302,0.1156,0.2031,5.6869,1.2194,5.6536,1.7204,2.7321,3.0562,5.0415,3.5751,3.8512,1.3916,5.1218,0.2812,0.1044,1.9923,4.1801,3.2181,2.6066,4.6383,2.0072,0.1066,4.8294,2.7758,4.1242,0.5363,1.3502,2.2213,2.8047,2.7104,4.2796,0.41,3.7771,0.1681,2.4353,9.1785,1.6739,3.0741,0.0743,0.3727,1.5726,3.1311,7.3988,2.1135,6.2341,4.4485,0.4702,0.0269,0.0048,4.2733,6.2761,2.0776,1.4366,6.5985,0.9683,2.5431,1.2906,0.0502,7.9113,4.1302,0.676,3.6289,3.1802,3.4144,0.4505,2.9039,1.1508,1.6883,3.4167,1.2623,10.098,0.6576,0.2283,6.4311,0.4424,0.422,0.3223,0.0412,4.8674,2.5116,0.0745,2.4914,4.183,0.6145,6.4733,0.5531,2.7567,5.0121,1.1254,7.6574,0.0391,1.4838,3.4166,1.8153,3.6812,2.505,4.3768,2.6205,2.0357,4.8289,6.0556,3.0559,5.0687,5.8327,2.3328,6.3647,1.3167,6.5571,4.4626,0.2005,0.0581,2.6917,3.7063,2.1466,2.7986,0.8966,2.3655,0.0608,6.2679,1.1966,3.6993,7.2375,4.8896,6.5943,3.38,2.8117,0.0012,1.0217,1.2188,1.5134,5.8902,7.0126,1.9398,0.2832,3.0816,4.699,3.335,3.0642,0.0344,0.7093,5.0843,0.9208,4.5884,3.5687,2.4052,0.0267,0.4772,1.5417,0.0891,1.4549,2.8303,3.7547,3.1702,0.1008,4.673,0.4708,0.6034,6.2554,2.7107,0.9041,0.0929,0.0059,0.2282,2.9478,1.5687,2.5814,6.3312,5.7361,2.1808,0.114,4.053,3.9789,2.2642,4.8783,1.2435,3.4525,3.1087,1.0699,1.7325,0.5228,4.2217,1.9518,4.164,3.4408,4.4587,3.9307,0.6515,3.8297,1.2131,3.6819,4.1741,3.3136,7.4114,1.8591,1.2303,6.4272,0.2183,4.0205,4.6814,0.0031,0.0014,0.0045,0.8545,1.3159,0.004,0.7049]}

And House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), who met to discuss a proposal by the Senate Finance Committee chair, Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), proposed an initial budget that would extend the American tax cut known as the \u201c tax reform \u201c introduced by President Barack Obama on December 22 before the expiration of its deadline on March 1.\n\u201c In the short term, that means a lower tax bill for working taxpayers \u2013 including taxpayers with small businesses and individuals with incomes just over $ 125,000 per year or $ 200,000 for married couples, \u201d said McConnell in a statement in Washington, in which he outlined the basic parameters of the budget. \u201c In the medium-term, this will also help to improve the financial prospects and long-term potential performance of the American economy \u201c.\nThe budget proposal eliminates or reduces taxes as much as $ 1,400 per individual and $ 600 per married couple, with tax reforms that could raise additional revenues by $ 2,000 per child from an optional tax on net wealth. In the case of individual income taxes, these would also include cuts to tax brackets for the top 20% earners, thus making the tax less progressive, without introducing a new tax threshold.\nThe proposal also contains tax cuts for the pension sector, an increase in the retirement age for Social Security and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, although the latter proposal is far from certain.\nThe budget proposal is still subject to change, given the fact that McConnell and Hoyer have agreed to keep all elements of the proposal open for further negotiation and are invited to suggest changes, while also insisting on their opposition to the Republican tax cut proposed by Senator Chris Murphy ( Connecticut), an ally of Trump.","token_len":438,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6722,4.971,1.7859,7.0361,0.8344,3.1705,7.809,0.5313,1.6436,2.2762,3.6842,5.6947,2.7142,2.488,0.1729,10.0665,6.9323,0.9404,0.1138,0.2051,11.2004,1.2204,1.6225,0.0684,0.2532,6.4696,2.3444,1.4268,0.0015,4.0362,3.1912,0.8409,2.0232,3.9138,1.431,8.7567,0.8444,4.308,2.1576,1.2072,3.4187,4.3682,2.1881,5.3763,0.0009,4.4716,0.0052,3.692,0.7057,0.2312,0.3019,20.7545,0.5151,3.1989,7.1279,4.4253,1.8752,0.5534,1.003,5.3622,4.8764,5.0569,1.5101,2.8131,1.8827,0.398,0.0281,0.3815,0.0002,1.0308,0.0879,0.0736,0.0273,0.4684,12.2877,0.9246,2.7109,0.0837,9.1654,0.0005,0.0002,0.0052,0.026,0.0144,0.0028,0.0117,0.0006,1.6702,5.9096,4.7499,4.3499,0.8798,2.3722,4.5819,5.3803,1.9318,2.5675,1.5431,0.0095,8.961,1.0835,5.9869,3.0641,0.7151,0.0005,3.9895,0.3002,0.014,0.0029,0.0059,0.1848,7.5242,3.5802,3.6579,3.3129,2.0813,0.6675,6.2272,0.8403,6.9622,5.6349,2.1507,6.4675,0.0074,0.1807,14.9389,9.1023,4.1812,4.0776,7.3269,0.6986,7.5044,0.656,0.7989,0.8075,0.0069,4.1545,4.0089,3.6218,7.0983,1.179,5.1884,0.0187,4.6191,6.061,2.6334,2.2717,1.4026,0.3339,0.4277,5.9512,1.5108,4.3699,1.8387,4.0754,0.4551,0.0446,3.2256,3.0864,2.6636,4.5764,1.5315,2.7427,2.4843,4.8773,5.3298,6.4442,3.5009,4.4363,1.2539,4.2228,1.3275,1.3336,1.6623,1.656,1.3632,7.005,0.848,0.0704,11.3384,0.0328,0.0123,2.7173,0.0115,3.917,3.7789,6.6677,0.0737,0.011,1.1336,2.6339,0.5002,3.1978,10.6071,6.2743,7.4071,3.3044,3.7496,0.4832,0.4998,5.4555,4.2532,1.6015,6.1656,0.8398,0.189,4.3711,1.1815,6.3207,4.6984,0.4688,0.4286,3.7795,2.5369,5.7153,0.9739,3.2594,0.3787,2.7978,2.3728,0.1352,0.0325,5.4526,3.2734,4.7461,3.5979,2.1593,4.8399,0.7619,5.0331,6.1127,4.6443,6.2893,0.0338,0.0426,5.814,7.7514,0.0176,0.5634,2.8229,0.7477,6.9449,1.2328,5.6394,0.304,2.0097,3.3683,3.5217,7.0032,5.0864,2.2208,3.5277,5.5586,1.9313,0.0167,0.4619,2.8068,4.1487,4.2121,1.4809,2.6077,1.8935,0.1342,4.9804,0.3129,3.357,0.862,1.5387,3.285,4.8874,6.4832,2.6062,3.0469,3.3361,5.1142,1.1436,1.7382,1.0743,3.665,2.2092,1.4591,0.7703,5.0753,4.7298,3.8055,8.3257,2.4522,2.7112,5.4941,4.0061,1.3923,4.1618,1.9091,5.6161,0.0167,2.7641,1.1848,1.829,0.1239,5.1752,1.888,4.2486,2.7476,6.0166,0.6979,4.6973,3.5894,1.3256,2.2565,1.2991,3.5511,2.123,7.1115,1.0412,7.3235,3.1635,1.6553,2.3378,9.3547,2.6067,2.8401,6.123,5.6084,1.4898,2.6217,0.8834,4.7834,0.6852,0.486,1.5919,2.8604,1.1162,4.959,3.9431,1.3341,0.5773,1.6179,9.4492,5.448,0.6587,4.6723,3.5133,0.642,0.6964,3.8006,0.264,0.949,5.0964,0.0003,2.2547,1.8377,1.8394,0.2331,0.6614,3.2332,0.5337,0.0388,1.44,0.5353,0.3821,0.0502,3.5948,1.8824,4.916,1.4509,4.7254,4.2815,1.9006,4.4106,0.6357,2.6832,2.3164,0.5529,1.5894,2.8814,2.0712,2.9491,4.4231,1.8187,0.0036,3.2326,1.2959,4.5746,1.0278,3.7039,0.0292,4.1703,1.6853,1.0031,0.0002,1.7487,3.486,0.5477,3.6707,4.9023,4.9556,0.0722,0.2987,3.5275,4.0593,1.554,5.0256,3.3863,3.2351,3.6993,8.8501,0.1318,7.0272,1.8318,3.4085,5.0835,3.4387,4.6864,1.4928,5.1697,5.3233,0.1988,1.701,4.4463,2.7151,3.9834,7.1611,0.2154,4.9257,5.785,0.8579,0.3444,13.6197,3.9031,4.1307,3.9425,0.1151,3.3767,0.82]}
{"prompt":"Eight former Catalan cabinet members currently in custody awaiting trial will appear before the Supreme Court on Friday , after requesting their release ahead of a regional election Dec. 21 in the wake of a","text":"Eight former Catalan cabinet members currently in custody awaiting trial will appear before the Supreme Court on Friday, after requesting their release ahead of a regional election Dec. 21 in the wake of a court ruling granting them bail.\nThe Catalan government, led by left-wing separatists, denounced the decision as a \"dictatorship\" and vowed to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), if necessary, for the defendants' release.\nBut the court ruled that the bail should be granted, based on a petition filed by their lawyer Jordi Pina, who argues that there is no justification for the charges. In the petition filed on Monday, the defense said that the charges are based on politically motivated claims of \"violation of public law\" and of a \"wrongful act\". The president Pedro Sanchez, a close ally of Madrid, has reiterated several times that he would never accept that they are released on bail. In a tweet, the president wrote: \"For the security of the Spanish state, there is no excuse for Catalan politics to escape justice.\"\nAs more than a million Catalans have voted in an election that is due to result in an impasse, the Catalan prosecution is looking at the possibility that many of those in jail should be released. Several of the Catalan judges who investigated Catalan independence have said it would be up to the judicial committee to decide whether to grant the defendants bail prior to the elections, something that the lawyers for the Catalan cabinet members argue is not necessary.\nThe Catalan judges' recommendation that they go on trial will be formally decided on Dec 12, according to the Constitutional Court, which will make the final ruling. However, the possibility is growing that the defendants, who also include former regional president Quim Torra, the former government of the Generalitat of Catalonia, who fled the country two weeks ago, and the former defense secretary, Pere Aragon\ufffds - will be out before the results, although that remains to be seen.\nThe Catalan regional Supreme Court will decide on the issue after a public hearing with the defendants themselves. Most had been summoned to appear before a judge on Thursday and five days since the public hearing.","token_len":438,"entropy":[8.2304,10.4377,5.2543,2.5655,8.2086,1.744,5.1059,6.566,0.2135,3.5388,3.068,0.927,1.1548,3.1812,0.005,0.8032,3.2645,1.4889,3.85,8.2117,3.359,1.0398,6.2299,0.0011,1.5323,7.9625,2.3953,8.3272,0.0147,4.0737,3.3328,2.4383,5.7699,0.0004,1.4869,4.0867,0.5004,5.2303,1.0067,1.8021,0.2691,0.2024,14.6564,2.8268,1.2487,3.0114,2.3349,0.0102,7.9224,0.0359,0.122,6.6617,0.3345,6.9743,0.2631,2.1214,1.2509,1.0114,0.7163,4.9436,3.4198,0.0007,1.3596,0.85,2.6463,0.2062,2.8851,2.1941,0.6987,1.6342,0.19,0.0135,0.2055,0.0018,4.0836,0.0052,0.0548,1.6271,6.8594,0.8713,1.0005,2.2984,1.7964,6.3494,0.9005,0.3439,0.1922,0.2489,3.7171,1.5537,2.5192,2.3317,1.1556,0.9995,3.991,4.5587,0.5128,1.3444,2.6364,5.2579,0.1017,2.0769,5.7207,1.8623,0.3546,6.8499,1.6471,8.3183,0.0265,4.0312,5.2572,1.2116,0.97,4.8842,0.4141,4.6738,0.6739,0.4888,5.0192,0.1522,1.1917,5.8458,2.1855,4.6918,2.4026,2.5744,3.5178,1.5325,2.6058,0.1387,1.9283,4.6722,2.7676,1.0842,1.034,4.2037,2.2474,2.5823,0.0816,8.0125,0.1037,5.7164,2.1088,2.4275,6.0754,0.3377,0.2366,4.2175,4.114,1.0903,0.8895,4.6084,2.962,0.7583,6.4895,0.3438,3.0792,3.1656,2.9007,6.491,9.8897,5.3601,1.9507,2.655,3.7615,0.2191,0.0395,5.1894,1.6336,1.7785,7.1229,7.9415,0.0297,0.3918,1.6767,2.1121,4.9485,2.8457,4.9525,5.8415,1.241,10.5569,3.933,0.1537,0.6715,5.2553,1.3909,4.8034,1.0953,2.3966,0.9632,2.5146,0.8137,0.1102,4.962,1.5843,6.5903,0.1805,1.1614,3.1362,3.1871,0.4704,3.9207,0.5315,0.2183,3.3118,0.325,6.5412,6.7421,2.2182,7.4902,1.7793,1.0765,0.1534,5.748,6.3452,2.133,2.7972,2.1932,3.1928,0.0078,2.0793,3.0004,1.1763,4.1028,2.033,1.6786,2.5764,2.4659,0.2959,6.0317,0.0475,2.9776,6.5169,0.0454,2.1589,1.2903,2.5158,11.1654,2.208,4.5555,2.4919,1.7602,2.0663,1.4127,5.2032,0.8024,2.0366,3.7562,2.8287,4.4083,0.5606,1.2047,1.4864,5.4079,2.3228,0.6503,4.0398,3.0916,1.3605,6.0592,5.2181,1.5543,1.6686,2.3291,4.9129,1.7277,0.218,4.658,0.0058,0.9529,4.9596,6.5428,0.8055,0.4133,0.8891,0.7252,2.492,1.7137,2.2996,1.2311,8.0906,0.0036,0.7837,2.4405,1.9414,5.5816,1.0533,2.4433,6.0506,2.4218,0.5399,3.0713,6.9885,2.4127,4.0419,0.8164,2.4471,3.322,0.4054,0.3536,1.6465,2.2335,5.1011,3.888,5.3742,2.2755,2.9892,5.223,4.079,1.3211,3.6349,1.1791,4.7764,3.027,1.4007,1.4281,9.6416,0.9909,2.9862,0.0012,1.2464,5.0527,0.125,1.3254,1.1611,1.7433,4.2777,1.774,2.4725,2.6518,1.4757,4.3724,0.0145,1.1968,6.5938,3.9322,5.5052,0.1392,0.9708,3.6574,2.9084,1.0857,5.3185,2.1087,1.7434,4.8125,1.8747,8.6505,6.9872,13.5784,7.1869,0.9914,3.7846,2.3876,5.2352,3.5986,2.597,9.385,0.584,0.0659,3.4481,0.1467,0.4536,4.2683,4.7587,2.3603,0.5622,4.9269,3.6259,0.0599,0.446,4.0524,2.4268,2.1544,6.0315,3.808,1.4921,8.848,8.4612,2.6759,11.7962,1.0208,9.9069,4.5729,0.9799,6.3906,3.1298,0.4764,6.5967,5.7432,4.3553,3.2218,4.4104,0.9432,0.0016,0.0557,0.0944,0.4453,1.4335,2.1897,5.6195,8.1759,0.0096,3.0364,1.642,0.8958,1.2466,3.125,3.943,1.2355,4.6569,0.6175,5.4799,1.1891,3.605,7.7473,2.4734,6.446,6.965,1.9108,4.5673,1.1492,2.8604,0.5343,1.9719,1.6982,1.824,3.0551,2.958,6.5988,3.3482,7.8687,0.8782,6.1248,1.1818,1.8962]}

Pillay also criticised the lack of human rights training courses for the police and the military, which she said left the army and police ill-equipped to tackle crime.\n\"It's the job of the authorities to do so, but they don't seem to be doing it well,\" Pillay said.\nIn response, Calderon said his government wished to prevent the re-emergence of the military on the streets. \"Only the civilian administration should decide how many troops there are on the streets,\" he said. \"Mexico must do whatever it takes to eradicate violence and crime from its society.\" But the government - headed by Calderon himself - was also pushing ahead with its anti-narco operations, which often turned violent.\nIn January, Calderon ordered President Arturo Valdes to authorise the use of lethal force by the military and police in response to violence in the drug war. The order was challenged by the human rights commissioner and prosecutors, who said it could amount to extrajudicial killings. Valdes defended his decision but the Supreme Court on Feb 22 ruled unanimously that the president must be given approval for the use of force in such situations.\nThousands of people have been killed in the conflict between the army, police and drug traffickers.","token_len":438,"entropy":[6.9248,2.5412,5.5323,0.0122,9.5889,4.316,1.1042,8.2903,12.1293,10.2001,2.6512,1.713,5.596,0.0132,5.6415,0.9923,6.0661,1.7424,3.4511,9.6021,2.0859,2.1144,2.0186,1.1536,1.5762,8.899,0.8076,0.0009,2.1187,6.5589,0.0532,0.9152,2.8713,0.4026,3.6909,0.5586,1.8016,6.2093,4.5235,0.5198,0.2635,0.1837,23.2883,0.095,1.4051,0.0041,1.2798,2.0286,0.0282,0.0002,0.0001,0.9989,2.8633,0.5966,0.7242,4.7193,3.69,2.4773,4.4772,0.1745,2.9265,2.6712,6.2521,7.6747,6.5398,1.7973,5.0094,0.0252,0.6692,4.6853,0.5635,3.8403,0.0327,0.5815,0.1707,3.7755,0.0546,4.1627,2.3795,0.0002,0.0015,0.0553,2.655,2.9537,0.7667,5.6384,0.0267,4.7549,0.4483,4.1976,3.6114,0.0017,1.3926,3.9382,1.7841,0.7479,0.0535,1.5812,5.8388,1.0322,3.395,2.5271,1.9881,1.4944,0.8883,2.7802,0.3225,2.3454,0.0046,1.3762,4.6602,8.7911,7.9732,2.4475,0.8536,2.6254,4.4941,4.5962,6.5949,1.094,0.3273,3.1577,3.7378,0.0018,0.6128,1.4283,4.3192,2.5198,3.2783,4.6703,0.0022,1.7499,5.5075,0.006,3.6984,0.0099,0.4926,1.9787,2.0182,1.9742,1.3079,3.4443,2.2477,0.941,3.757,2.3121,0.6138,3.8794,2.5835,4.3318,6.8582,0.0015,10.6136,0.1374,4.9313,0.2256,0.199,5.157,0.1213,0.0048,6.3469,4.7705,0.9913,2.9184,1.295,6.7118,0.0267,2.4053,3.6191,0.8682,1.9641,0.1961,1.2001,1.217,0.2423,2.3335,1.8041,0.9434,4.8717,3.2258,1.5095,2.3612,3.8932,0.9178,5.6577,0.0019,1.9199,4.5993,0.7827,4.1636,0.001,5.1722,0.017,5.1705,7.1472,1.2821,2.1848,3.3482,1.0703,2.4687,1.1019,1.4796,1.6331,1.2221,0.3502,6.6225,2.2717,4.2698,1.7194,0.558,7.7465,0.5909,0.0628,0.2987,3.4619,3.9588,0.5005,0.1308,1.6382,2.6258,1.7502,3.7707,4.614,0.0215,0.446,4.5745,0.4694,3.6265,5.0666,1.4157,2.1072,1.9335,1.9913,0.0007,4.2379,0.1009,1.5201,2.1193,1.5961,2.292,0.512,1.6077,0.0014,0.1252,0.3083,0.4687,3.2901,3.5529,1.4892,1.2093,0.0264,1.1185,3.3413,0.7869,8.1373,0.3713,5.7213,1.7612,6.7329,0.6505,2.2161,0.0083,0.007,0.0036,1.6114,2.135,5.2336,0.5211,1.6788,1.8269,1.67,7.1694,1.9764,5.4571,4.4766,2.6471,3.5827,2.2667,4.4987,3.4609,2.5951,0.2917,4.1154,0.2239,0.1503,1.0263,0.2402,0.1461,0.3366,2.0185,5.6582,3.0857,3.6458,4.1523,0.6567,1.1793,0.1415,5.7114,4.2123,1.3669,4.1363,2.9084,1.1465,3.5717,0.5525,6.9147,2.429,2.6223,8.832,5.2012,0.0198,2.8438,0.0067,3.8292,0.1239,3.97,3.1275,3.9168,3.5993,0.0961,3.5804,3.2361,0.001,7.6377,0.0097,4.3425,1.0694,1.3942,5.9593,6.9411,1.275,0.9306,0.2681,2.7345,4.1152,0.366,3.1213,0.0063,2.4072,6.6782,8.3446,0.7672,10.0918,2.0557,0.8342,8.9712,0.1074,1.2055,2.2655,0.0168,3.5975,0.0461,3.4775,1.221,0.8161,2.803,1.5545,1.6126,3.3361,0.0044,4.6793,1.4635,1.155,3.2366,0.9295,0.5202,2.278,3.5436,1.2117,4.8897,0.4269,1.1395,4.7091,0.0116,4.8663,2.6312,6.3129,1.4828,0.4952,1.3295,1.2434,3.5509,4.3215,0.0016,5.4517,0.0184,0.4814,0.626,4.5091,0.0027,4.8654,1.8536,1.2073,3.2658,4.6806,4.3731,0.009,3.7764,6.1087,7.0942,1.8802,6.9414,0.828,0.9403,3.4471,3.2921,2.835,2.7399,5.9873,1.9047,1.0034,0.273,0.0146,1.1519,2.8276,4.0363,3.0342,0.1822,0.431,7.6963,0.2058,1.3331,0.8857,0.4297,0.1564,0.9477,1.143,3.5885,2.6739,1.0762,4.1109,2.7559,1.645,0.128,1.2844,2.7974,2.4062]}

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. said in a letter.\n\u201cGiven the current situation, we respectfully urge the President of the United States to call on his own administration to immediately appoint leadership to the Cabinet-level National Infrastructure Advisory Council, to ensure that the nation\u2019s best people lead the effort to build the infrastructure of tomorrow. \u201d","token_len":440,"entropy":[7.2043,0.2918,4.6628,7.053,0.0979,9.3813,2.8535,2.034,2.3976,4.758,2.1483,3.447,2.752,0.0015,0.4559,2.1417,1.8133,1.439,6.4339,0.1842,2.8521,1.0296,0.0028,14.1678,8.1845,6.6866,5.0078,0.127,4.8411,2.1575,0.3347,2.9182,5.2472,1.246,1.1293,2.448,0.4451,14.743,6.1568,4.2414,0.6185,0.297,0.8238,5.9602,2.1918,0.9207,0.1699,0.3798,0.4727,0.1483,0.0633,0.327,0.7166,3.0093,0.9322,3.5198,1.6845,1.2693,3.1718,1.5847,2.8972,2.5345,0.0015,6.8627,2.6383,2.5077,1.2286,2.7969,3.6493,0.2126,0.4572,3.553,4.1876,2.9024,7.1842,2.2229,3.3362,1.9299,1.9573,1.3514,10.5743,3.7065,11.5383,6.1291,1.0945,3.4704,0.7526,3.092,3.6686,5.5091,1.9634,4.7673,0.0396,6.1953,0.7596,0.077,0.2017,4.4851,4.3922,0.3927,2.0303,8.5952,8.431,3.9889,8.3243,5.729,4.2,5.81,0.8512,7.9867,8.8991,6.2385,10.1026,0.0002,3.9957,1.1559,2.3481,0.7957,1.3209,3.3559,0.9392,2.0556,0.0737,0.0435,4.7678,5.3043,0.6772,1.9637,2.6367,2.4699,0.3439,0.0017,0.111,4.244,0.1619,0.3613,3.3642,3.1994,10.458,0.9182,3.3012,0.0689,2.5864,2.4853,1.1165,0.658,4.6934,1.5824,3.7358,0.9555,5.7352,2.3173,0.3458,5.0616,7.7347,0.2017,0.2156,2.7328,3.7465,2.4668,1.6786,3.7045,5.3412,0.4438,5.0618,0.1564,4.3403,0.3075,2.4715,5.2889,4.7917,5.7103,5.1476,2.7844,5.8947,3.9519,3.0238,2.0766,4.7395,7.2055,0.7572,0.5066,5.883,7.4827,1.9049,5.392,2.06,7.8428,0.0022,0.0114,0.0018,0.884,0.6453,2.2733,0.7804,0.3923,0.4784,3.8953,0.4674,7.0862,2.1108,0.0118,0.0513,5.0796,1.4984,4.5462,0.5359,4.3223,4.8771,5.4078,6.3536,0.3094,1.3833,3.1103,0.6288,1.2243,5.0769,3.0091,1.4225,3.2095,1.6318,0.7474,4.3574,1.8348,6.7605,2.9025,1.2634,0.687,1.7368,0.8435,4.5579,4.5424,3.298,2.3081,0.193,0.3245,0.5456,1.4364,3.3826,0.885,4.1171,2.7083,1.8845,3.0116,1.59,3.0305,5.2123,3.9073,2.6977,0.0962,4.4625,1.4611,3.5062,0.2367,2.1172,6.697,3.7304,1.2467,3.8989,3.7885,3.3488,1.9985,2.1442,1.9021,1.8134,2.7926,0.6213,0.3013,2.4813,2.6684,1.8886,4.0329,4.2383,2.2272,2.2129,0.2934,1.3298,0.0007,1.5783,6.9815,3.4467,4.2797,3.7198,1.7633,0.8679,3.4355,0.7853,1.6423,0.1832,4.1173,1.3922,1.6201,1.411,0.7754,2.6027,0.5258,0.2986,1.5338,0.6756,5.0507,4.9841,5.319,1.6111,0.6487,4.2365,0.0184,4.0682,1.3702,1.7045,1.6184,0.4695,0.0886,2.0401,4.9484,0.7147,2.5701,0.1686,3.3818,5.9402,0.96,2.5873,2.4476,1.2359,6.8853,0.6456,1.2114,5.4894,0.0367,6.905,2.657,5.8225,0.9159,4.7137,3.4305,0.8569,1.9584,1.8996,2.1892,0.6703,2.3665,9.3459,7.5148,9.1317,6.2594,4.3223,0.0009,0.785,3.4103,4.9759,0.0007,3.1701,5.1163,0.0892,0.0072,0.1275,0.0,0.0063,0.251,6.0514,0.8415,0.0391,1.4074,0.3473,1.1367,3.8117,0.0103,11.2445,7.197,2.4287,0.0349,0.0117,0.0038,0.0025,0.0003,3.9315,10.7047,0.1892,0.5189,3.702,2.6654,0.24,1.1017,0.5503,6.343,0.5889,3.5078,2.9553,0.4994,2.6394,5.6816,5.3765,1.3829,1.4527,4.3817,0.0129,0.0174,0.0019,0.52,4.5003,1.9909,2.5116,5.1821,4.7882,0.3366,3.3335,4.5273,5.8193,1.2213,1.5349,7.5025,5.3473,0.0782,3.9944,0.2169,2.157,0.0461,1.7559,2.4241,2.5812,0.6271,1.6074,3.6134,2.2691,0.4699,0.2863,5.6071,7.4513,6.1865,1.1614,3.8374,0.198,2.9803,2.1783,2.3679,2.6197,1.7496,1.1089,2.3241,0.2668]}

The Republican-backed plan aims to make Americans more financially stable and less dependent on income tax breaks, creating a better job market. L\u00f3pez Obrador, the center-right former mayor of Mexico City, which is a major trade partner with the United States, said he was prepared to move faster on implementing the new tax system but added that a \u201cgreat deal\u201d still has to be worked out.\nTrump has made his tax reform a cornerstone of his 2016 campaign and his presidency, proposing several variations since his election. The plan currently being considered by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives would significantly lower income tax rates on ordinary people \u2014 who earn an average of $40,000 a year \u2014 putting the average U.S. tax bill at 19 percent of income. The proposal, which needs to go through two chambers of Congress before being approved and signed by Trump, would eliminate corporate taxes for the vast majority of businesses, with only small businesses left paying taxes.\nThe new tax plan also would lower the top federal income tax rate to 30 percent, raise some tax credits for people with children in school for college, eliminate deductible health insurance premiums, increase some tax credits like the child care credit and include a payroll tax cut for small businesses. The plan also would increase the percentage of sales tax taken by states and replace sales taxes with a flat tax.\nPrevious articleBoeing buys Australian defence contractor Arrium in deal worth A$4.9bn to bolster future defence projects","token_len":440,"entropy":[10.6577,6.0893,2.6989,3.0385,7.1922,0.192,2.0929,5.4983,6.5618,0.2551,2.7205,1.8936,2.0727,5.7954,2.3264,2.8014,7.752,0.4037,5.3074,5.6332,1.5385,1.5839,1.3469,0.0044,3.165,4.3497,0.9402,0.0076,9.1023,18.3879,5.451,3.0297,3.705,2.6832,4.1436,1.6035,6.2674,0.0025,1.1716,18.1049,6.8396,8.474,4.6431,1.9355,1.5111,7.8116,1.7279,4.4899,6.5944,0.0015,0.0016,0.0471,7.693,9.294,0.146,7.5976,5.4125,5.7838,0.0728,2.173,8.3834,0.4958,0.0919,0.509,0.2823,0.0891,0.1789,0.3051,5.6,5.3352,0.7808,22.2831,5.4614,7.085,2.4218,5.5881,0.7744,4.9231,0.5317,0.0659,0.5739,1.9453,0.0206,0.0,0.5222,0.0568,0.0056,1.3872,2.561,2.4107,0.5831,0.7638,0.7408,1.4382,0.8343,3.9382,4.3927,6.0756,2.2029,6.3821,4.9437,1.5381,0.2419,1.2232,8.5879,5.3,0.0364,0.0183,6.1254,5.0232,0.3933,3.8036,1.3571,2.0657,5.849,1.8152,0.8927,0.5316,2.0958,4.298,2.5603,3.8077,0.0329,1.28,2.7123,3.1088,3.1606,8.9738,0.1423,9.4726,6.6168,2.2761,0.4074,5.8575,8.5204,4.7398,0.0818,2.1106,3.813,3.1854,1.756,4.422,1.1335,4.2714,0.0445,4.5012,6.6281,2.178,4.9314,3.2082,1.5322,3.1741,0.7212,0.0569,9.2472,2.4759,4.3398,1.6428,6.9705,1.0999,5.1539,5.5432,0.728,2.2989,2.964,0.0059,0.0008,0.1874,0.0017,0.0014,1.4399,3.2122,5.5853,0.0598,0.2654,3.3532,1.49,0.0509,3.3469,0.4634,0.5271,5.2028,1.61,3.1567,1.8099,3.4533,0.2685,0.98,0.1819,0.6153,0.0068,0.1414,0.9152,1.1097,2.9245,4.4892,0.0419,5.6947,6.9973,2.3132,5.1065,0.5711,4.9661,1.5781,3.5559,4.775,2.6938,0.3763,3.9332,6.9728,0.0571,6.9369,1.3068,1.6536,0.585,5.7797,3.8634,0.0382,0.1401,4.126,0.0527,0.9307,0.4167,10.3331,2.3327,3.8258,2.8585,3.9768,2.9437,2.545,2.7938,0.0913,0.0292,5.9755,0.2632,2.0718,3.0633,4.7923,1.0549,5.5044,4.7555,8.5212,7.4398,2.9958,1.409,0.9211,2.2495,2.0969,5.8417,6.5504,1.7413,0.9177,1.2266,1.8511,0.4475,0.5665,1.5552,1.0216,0.0019,1.1365,5.6974,2.0676,4.1338,0.7728,0.0227,2.5105,6.1264,2.8036,5.0434,3.7222,2.5552,3.3822,0.2711,0.1283,0.4717,3.8001,0.0291,0.6705,0.5748,0.0014,0.9984,8.2686,2.3619,3.9714,3.3613,0.0003,0.0014,0.0903,2.1748,3.347,1.5103,5.7384,1.2583,3.2421,1.4251,0.7256,1.7295,2.0912,3.3376,1.0018,6.7074,1.1992,3.673,0.9095,4.351,4.389,0.3774,0.0761,1.5983,1.7472,1.7324,5.7464,1.0514,1.0226,1.7704,0.5509,0.7413,3.2455,4.2705,2.1202,2.9756,2.6716,4.3132,0.0037,0.0104,4.408,1.2455,4.1211,3.8881,3.101,2.4946,8.2598,4.0285,2.961,1.4177,1.0487,2.063,4.3273,1.4726,1.4792,2.5633,1.0671,2.8871,0.9437,2.4797,4.3716,0.5925,0.0361,0.0575,1.6176,4.2146,0.0616,1.1741,5.3502,6.0932,4.6073,1.8225,0.8786,3.5293,1.6515,2.853,4.36,5.7723,4.7836,4.1895,1.3969,3.9336,12.0443,1.9171,1.073,1.4925,1.156,3.4518,5.7479,2.7114,0.321,9.3261,1.5451,4.4115,3.3814,2.6441,1.2343,7.1759,1.325,6.4093,1.1336,3.4113,0.7945,3.4521,0.2833,0.4143,1.8325,1.2155,0.8351,0.8193,2.8658,0.8294,5.2674,0.176,4.9729,0.6337,4.8545,1.6612,3.9454,1.5429,6.0477,6.2192,1.3529,0.5447,1.0621,1.931,1.5227,1.5208,0.8433,8.6621,8.8253,12.3486,6.2066,3.0101,8.0867,6.6551,6.284,1.4218,7.337,5.5875,3.6885,4.7742,2.9209,7.3657,0.1967,3.2939,0.4868,2.6795,1.5566,4.3386,4.9339,5.8959,2.2435,5.9128]}

Duterte's remarks sparked concern in some Filipinos that the police chief's move could undermine the war on drugs.\n\"I am not the criminal!\" said the military general at the start of the press conference, referring to Duterte.\nThe Philippines started a crackdown on powerful drug syndicates after a deadly 2006 raid that killed at least 70 people, sparking months of riots.\nFewer than a dozen people were killed Sunday in the police raid in the northern Samar Islands, the AFP officer said.\nPolice used gas, water cannons, and tear gas to disperse the crowd. The AFP officer said some injured protesters complained of breathing difficulties and injuries in their eyes.\n\"This is not for the military. This is for the law,\" AFP officer Ricardo Almonte said.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, although rival drug lords and their fighters routinely accuse each other of the killings.\nThe AFP officer said they found three empty shell cases that may have been used as missiles.\nIn May, Duterte asked the military to stand down from law enforcement duties in order to \"protect the life and dignity of the people\" from alleged political meddling. The government said there was a need to avoid an \"ethnic cleansing\" of the drug lords' territories.\nThe police chief said he had also asked his men to refrain from public relations work for fear it could undermine the fight against the drug trade.\nThe AFP officer said the officers were \"very worried\" about Duterte's comments.\nThe Philippine parliament is considering whether to reinstate the police's illegal war on drugs, but it has not yet passed legislation that would permit such actions.\nDuterte, who is in Asia to attend a regional security conference in Bangkok, is due to return to the Philippines on Wednesday. He has vowed to push through a law lifting the ban on drugs.","token_len":441,"entropy":[10.7571,7.4834,4.3325,2.0469,1.8035,1.488,1.9874,0.5679,9.3552,1.8281,9.2442,2.4572,2.2027,1.236,2.4682,5.5932,4.5269,0.0022,2.1095,1.8645,3.4054,5.1321,6.6204,6.2483,2.6351,2.8192,4.6291,5.7962,0.227,0.0014,7.734,1.2849,7.4726,5.1265,0.174,7.9658,1.3852,2.5178,3.4167,0.4064,0.1982,17.213,0.0065,5.6023,2.4484,5.1389,4.855,3.9372,5.5687,1.8728,2.6128,8.6158,6.7351,0.0619,2.7354,6.2006,6.376,2.2034,3.4911,7.9518,3.3771,6.4357,4.1338,3.0706,1.5116,3.5864,0.9887,5.3839,2.0457,4.6055,4.1816,4.4132,1.415,2.7374,4.007,0.0013,1.4372,1.3835,3.1632,3.7331,1.3044,3.7366,1.1274,3.8388,1.5289,5.0571,0.6924,0.0132,0.5783,0.1323,4.5301,2.0063,2.0895,1.6052,4.2169,7.3095,6.9989,2.4452,2.3977,5.7058,3.6644,3.4894,1.7014,3.6842,0.0055,2.3608,4.8613,0.0629,1.3139,2.6192,0.0409,1.777,1.5448,0.8382,1.9296,3.1822,7.2962,1.7506,3.2783,0.4959,8.323,0.5011,3.8338,0.0096,2.4882,1.7419,3.1462,6.397,1.7432,2.4619,0.5644,2.4052,0.0001,3.736,0.3365,1.7841,5.7256,6.0539,0.0198,4.8165,1.4785,0.684,8.2755,3.8953,0.0431,3.2976,0.7088,1.5617,0.9063,0.8899,7.1181,1.1083,1.4331,4.8183,1.7222,2.2433,1.2706,3.7668,8.3828,4.6919,0.9859,2.7112,7.6289,9.2468,0.3554,0.3692,0.5331,3.7969,4.5692,6.1168,3.5508,2.2273,0.9258,1.2263,2.1731,1.5136,0.0924,0.5698,0.9293,1.9147,1.0214,2.3589,2.4423,3.2446,0.3868,0.498,3.5995,7.1247,4.0427,6.4857,0.6532,4.9146,1.2508,1.5071,5.9059,3.6685,2.0424,3.3628,0.3904,0.2905,2.1251,4.0524,0.6837,1.7753,5.6556,1.1648,4.0705,1.6439,1.2555,0.092,0.5781,0.6211,4.4882,1.8799,5.1952,1.2217,6.26,4.7047,5.2781,0.7593,0.5284,0.6258,0.3742,5.5176,1.3408,0.302,0.2768,1.9612,0.197,0.0786,0.4589,0.1524,2.5495,1.3144,3.5107,9.2733,2.9118,1.75,2.3589,3.2719,5.3307,6.8721,4.7324,1.8582,0.0042,0.0356,4.1557,1.0663,0.2421,0.3143,1.8332,1.9064,0.2785,0.4408,4.7727,4.4065,4.2404,5.6439,5.4638,8.8827,3.4206,5.2173,0.2529,0.4313,1.0677,2.0806,7.6304,1.4497,0.7053,4.082,4.5322,0.335,2.2907,5.8019,1.4028,2.538,0.509,7.2527,0.1767,2.6356,6.614,0.1757,5.0158,2.8027,3.1883,0.0421,3.5055,2.5056,0.8121,4.7771,1.0032,1.6766,0.3146,1.1335,1.4124,1.9403,5.5321,5.0742,6.1141,4.3865,0.7944,2.7097,2.886,2.7297,4.1899,0.8144,2.6479,2.7738,0.5653,5.3331,4.23,1.8573,5.6914,0.6923,0.3451,0.3525,0.7666,2.4641,2.8133,4.2119,4.7873,0.6406,0.208,1.8482,4.3091,0.464,0.9984,2.0459,1.6855,4.5759,2.4418,3.351,3.8968,0.2676,4.6269,0.0089,6.4037,5.2512,3.6692,2.9194,2.7317,3.8341,1.0915,3.4039,0.8612,3.5706,0.1415,1.4713,0.8936,2.1019,0.2461,0.3318,1.9055,1.7254,0.152,0.388,1.6173,4.9336,1.5048,3.0904,3.362,3.6085,0.5608,0.7871,3.1934,0.2171,2.767,1.2875,0.4562,2.1439,2.8848,7.2536,2.2419,3.0077,2.3591,0.1915,4.514,0.1719,1.2723,3.915,5.2755,8.0157,2.088,0.2077,0.1169,1.1978,2.9563,2.5679,1.2916,1.7415,1.7051,2.2999,2.9302,2.8534,0.2804,5.331,2.8577,3.9638,0.2841,0.4368,2.9624,0.0059,3.0101,0.6435,2.0789,2.6927,6.6186,2.7195,2.2346,0.7542,5.898,3.4993,1.662,0.9723,4.7642,0.649,2.6094,2.63,0.0574,3.8303,0.2565,1.4846,0.3973,0.8872,2.2009,1.0806,2.6015,1.0684,2.9715,0.1425,4.8135,2.5084,1.1997,3.291,6.2432,0.9797,1.7723,0.0524,3.3563,2.0497]}

to Bangladesh, the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ).In a humanitarian operation called Operation SkyBridge, the ICRC flew to the border over the weekend and began bringing food, water and medicines with its own teams, as well as with an Australian contingent.A joint ICRC and Australian team is currently at the Myanmar-Rakhine border, collecting essential items needed to help Rohingya in Rakhine State, from tents to sleeping bags to mosquito nets, medicines, generators and so forth.An Australian contingent carried out a ground operation in the Khok Khon and Maungtaw township areas recently and collected several items.I think Operation SkyBridge will be a long sustained effort, a number of missions, not just one.We are planning for this to continue, into the New Year.It s an ongoing task to help the Rohingya.Myanmar also announced last week that it would begin dismantling illegal posts along the border with Bangladesh.The military has said more than 100,000 Rohingya refugees may flee Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh from Rakhine border posts between the military-occupied state and Bangladesh by the end of October as a part of its offensive in the state.The military has reportedly used violence and harassment by Rohingya civilians to prevent them from leaving in peace.The refugees were forced to leave by local officials in Rakhine State, who made it a rule that anyone wishing to exit has to go to the border posts.Officials who stopped or delayed Rohingya fleeing the state were severely reprimanded by troops stationed at the post, who also threatened to send them into illegal border crossings and other areas under military occupation to apprehend them later, according to UN Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ).The government also closed schools and closed down other civil activities to prevent Rohingya refugees from leaving their hometowns in fear of arrest.On Saturday, after the fighting in Myanmar s northwest region had already stopped, thousands of fleeing Rohingya people from Rakhine State crowded into the border area with Bangladesh to escape violence, and faced difficulties and even arrests by security forces.","token_len":441,"entropy":[5.7661,7.3652,4.2142,1.7363,0.0033,3.8881,8.2584,11.8665,7.8745,1.8228,0.0008,0.0003,0.9214,4.1058,5.0972,1.1672,6.0603,0.2319,0.0099,0.5403,5.4812,1.9749,7.4349,6.8885,4.4504,7.6203,10.3264,0.5398,0.002,2.3876,0.1272,2.8902,0.1815,2.6461,2.3535,4.3415,2.3006,0.0475,0.0005,0.006,0.0001,1.6622,8.7574,0.0001,4.672,6.3516,2.4351,6.7197,3.7423,3.7325,2.641,8.9668,5.387,1.0448,2.1366,2.9658,0.0002,7.281,3.7728,1.7125,3.1359,7.4188,1.1478,3.3397,1.8457,3.7972,5.2118,3.4067,1.2062,0.7316,0.5495,3.0736,5.1783,6.438,5.4908,4.1504,2.4222,3.47,1.3474,0.0044,5.2406,4.6321,5.1004,2.8772,0.8687,4.4985,4.9054,4.5477,0.0003,1.0234,2.1305,2.3342,3.6178,2.6253,3.8682,0.412,3.6836,2.8383,2.0649,0.042,0.0025,0.0905,1.7944,6.8524,7.6135,3.8242,4.4198,0.6372,2.9466,3.9699,3.3478,3.5506,0.0008,0.0025,1.94,2.1243,5.0994,4.8645,0.8288,5.3689,0.1342,1.6199,7.2826,0.0744,2.2555,5.6203,1.4478,4.4093,0.4887,4.6094,3.5633,0.4199,5.0558,1.6205,2.6733,6.8538,0.4946,1.5702,4.0022,1.1289,1.653,1.7241,5.3768,6.4896,5.4645,4.0773,5.2896,4.9006,0.3007,11.1168,2.9504,7.1169,3.944,7.995,2.9203,5.5833,5.8049,2.7167,2.1937,6.9259,4.8195,6.8141,0.0296,0.0046,1.532,1.5492,1.3154,4.2803,9.0909,1.6321,1.6217,4.9376,4.6387,0.0273,4.91,2.5082,4.7712,0.4912,1.2487,1.6359,4.4772,1.6355,5.2902,3.2306,3.6742,1.1268,2.3409,1.9908,7.3408,0.8692,7.4258,0.0271,1.1198,4.3224,10.2085,3.5743,2.7212,4.6605,2.5766,2.6666,1.5091,1.2024,2.6134,6.9382,0.1805,4.8207,6.7818,3.3194,0.6264,0.3695,0.7759,1.6691,3.6016,6.1426,5.1218,7.7083,3.6801,0.6635,0.8982,1.8515,0.4062,1.2373,2.925,4.9052,1.4081,3.2325,6.1307,0.0651,2.3256,0.6302,0.0023,0.3735,5.323,4.9033,3.6741,2.5837,2.0066,3.1911,0.1315,5.183,2.6257,0.0002,0.0025,7.9259,6.6544,5.6882,2.34,5.7063,2.2865,4.5113,3.401,2.6393,1.4549,5.4459,0.7493,0.1268,0.0012,4.372,5.8497,2.423,4.6137,0.0042,2.2021,4.1858,2.4773,0.9773,4.3452,0.4844,1.835,2.4803,1.0317,5.3881,4.3772,4.9995,2.0299,4.4273,3.5404,1.2471,4.1103,0.7834,3.5823,1.3657,0.2891,2.2587,4.8213,4.4381,1.5714,2.0047,7.1638,3.5648,2.4332,0.295,1.972,3.6771,4.9472,3.3585,2.4001,1.3015,0.0021,0.0013,1.2303,1.5714,2.6716,5.9226,2.0013,2.3257,7.3255,1.1698,4.0005,5.3749,0.0146,6.5737,6.701,0.0884,2.8682,2.1516,1.4204,1.4242,3.075,1.0091,6.0847,5.3126,6.4286,4.2155,3.5721,4.9181,2.8375,1.9758,2.8579,3.4407,7.5969,3.25,0.002,1.6306,6.7219,4.9515,1.9535,0.6772,3.5757,1.8114,2.8006,3.8658,4.5417,0.5631,3.5516,1.3167,3.9304,5.951,5.5964,3.6944,3.4798,3.4565,2.0036,4.5259,2.6197,1.8804,4.9542,9.6249,0.8048,6.7114,3.1479,1.7919,0.0013,4.796,4.9724,0.1247,0.795,5.5242,0.5838,1.6148,3.4545,3.0975,5.6928,5.436,1.0802,4.7516,4.5338,4.111,6.3814,5.87,3.1438,1.8896,2.3047,2.281,0.2312,2.1283,3.2159,6.8438,0.3825,2.8752,5.9497,0.6654,5.3036,1.106,4.3014,1.8365,0.334,5.6307,1.7579,5.4514,1.9026,2.4076,2.0662,6.8563,5.3019,4.7684,4.3405,3.9906,0.4986,5.2122,0.1426,6.3202,1.088,3.7073,2.8949,1.018,0.0019,0.0016,0.7873,7.6089,0.7054,1.544,2.9057,3.37,3.7998,0.7921,2.3604,2.9529,2.1316,2.1614,3.2221,6.8904,6.2711,5.6173,4.2314,4.855,3.2432,2.0928,0.123,0.771]}

{"prompt":"Humanitarian crises around the world will worsen next year with no let-up in African civil wars , near-famines in conflict-ridden regions and the threat of Islamist violence , a Geneva-based think-tank predicted in a report","text":"Humanitarian crises around the world will worsen next year with no let-up in African civil wars, near-famines in conflict-ridden regions and the threat of Islamist violence, a Geneva-based think-tank predicted in a report today.  It said that although 2014 will be better for war-torn nations than 2013, the next 12 months may be \"worse than the worst years of the 2011 Ebola epidemic.\" \nAn emergency relief agency for war-torn countries said that a global financial crisis has forced more than 40 million people from their homes in 2013 in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America. An analysis using data from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) found that nearly half of these displaced people were forced to move for reasons of war or conflict. The crisis led to an estimated $65 billion in displacements - twice the 2014 figure. \"2014 is no different than 2013,\" the Geneva-based Refworld Worldwide Institute wrote.\nIn Ethiopia, a \"war zone\" between the government and rebels has led to the most serious displacement of civilians in Africa for the past decade, the report said. The crisis has been so severe that food aid has spread the famine that hit the country in January 2013 across much of West Africa. The agency said over 1 million people have been forced to flee since mid-November.\nWorst-hit were Somalia, where fighting in the northern part continued despite a cease-fire the government agreed with the opposition last year. Over 2 million Somalis have been forcibly displaced from their homes so far this year, with the crisis worsening as food shortages have forced people to move in droves.\nThe conflict in Syria has also killed at least 150,000 people and forced another 2.6 million to flee in the past year. Half of the refugees have moved to Lebanon, including 4.2 million at one point in 2012. Another 1.5 million refugees have arrived in Jordan.\nThe worst refugee crisis, however, is Pakistan, where the current and most-widespread wave of immigration led by the country's poorest has pushed an extra 2 million people from their homes during the last year.","token_len":441,"entropy":[9.1269,6.6585,5.0391,0.0132,0.0738,4.6602,5.6801,6.7778,0.2017,3.793,3.9037,11.398,0.3953,0.0736,0.393,8.8955,5.8749,1.8995,1.1798,8.8412,0.6719,4.81,5.8331,2.4199,6.3506,0.9666,1.3377,3.2874,1.3662,2.3767,5.0853,0.0927,5.1284,2.8711,2.4604,3.9312,9.5189,0.7088,0.0505,1.7392,1.6271,0.001,5.4159,2.0069,0.7519,0.4682,3.5713,0.1283,11.911,8.4569,2.0862,1.5876,5.3445,6.5151,2.1532,1.0015,5.5818,2.3234,7.189,2.2815,1.1401,2.7536,1.3089,2.8826,0.241,1.6704,4.8832,4.8382,0.6252,3.9336,1.0139,2.3662,4.3263,0.0481,2.5861,2.455,2.186,2.5523,0.5983,0.617,6.4552,8.1486,1.2401,2.088,1.3491,1.795,12.4808,4.2895,6.1377,3.8107,3.3822,5.026,0.1467,0.1769,0.9524,3.1299,1.9402,3.855,4.8157,4.5259,0.5958,3.8732,3.3883,3.894,0.123,4.0521,1.0799,0.202,2.2557,0.1512,0.0673,2.0906,5.3113,4.6624,6.6825,0.6129,1.7323,1.1423,1.1593,0.312,1.0556,0.0019,0.7017,6.4189,4.9316,7.5722,1.2592,0.1837,0.7187,3.1728,0.0279,2.0065,1.066,0.0663,0.0065,0.0013,0.0016,0.0015,0.0,0.0022,1.5736,7.6888,0.0049,0.6341,1.9082,0.0899,4.3967,1.8338,0.2676,3.6884,2.3317,0.6336,2.1248,4.4242,0.3585,2.4272,5.2008,5.582,1.9023,4.3607,1.2246,3.1927,0.6636,2.6886,5.2664,4.8356,0.2048,2.4822,1.5513,2.4318,5.8655,0.2114,0.4823,8.8001,0.0998,5.1274,6.7765,0.7228,6.8054,2.8514,0.8262,3.667,9.3816,1.4522,4.1513,1.7173,0.9737,1.4516,1.2492,2.0303,7.1866,0.5657,0.0052,13.051,7.4063,9.3181,2.2728,4.47,0.6915,1.7445,2.9652,6.6985,0.339,2.6558,5.0559,3.7973,3.7939,0.4001,4.9452,2.091,2.3073,0.4457,4.074,1.7768,3.3779,0.0444,2.1123,5.4603,2.5683,2.5904,1.2458,2.1292,1.0604,4.2702,3.2819,2.2858,0.5958,2.2627,1.2483,1.3941,1.6357,0.3482,0.1704,1.9484,4.4652,0.9573,3.3317,3.6871,0.7755,0.2637,5.8427,2.8216,1.3833,6.6956,5.6457,4.961,5.4374,8.2145,2.5797,0.5719,1.6012,3.6527,2.6525,7.6728,3.4444,0.0073,4.4542,0.0432,0.694,2.0436,5.4467,1.1446,5.8775,2.5395,1.5883,0.4198,1.1595,0.578,1.7316,0.4099,0.5811,4.3311,5.3097,0.0437,3.1344,1.3767,1.2243,5.8387,3.8225,2.3524,1.8418,4.9261,3.8475,0.4268,1.0498,6.2678,3.0346,1.2588,4.6101,1.9226,10.0219,4.0132,2.049,2.9095,0.0632,0.001,5.7976,3.1322,4.0133,3.035,0.9311,2.0459,3.5984,1.5726,0.4129,5.8866,2.7067,1.0728,4.8373,0.0081,1.0099,0.8396,5.5474,0.3349,2.4637,0.2494,0.148,6.0181,0.0042,0.4089,0.0194,0.7969,2.962,2.1722,6.3974,3.9925,2.2924,5.1128,2.1358,2.368,2.1867,3.5431,0.4609,2.7696,3.5434,4.5331,0.0,0.4994,1.3567,1.7111,4.987,1.373,2.456,1.0441,2.4466,4.3556,1.8587,0.0003,5.2296,0.197,0.0164,0.3456,1.9533,2.8629,4.3683,3.2042,1.0771,2.2545,0.007,0.794,0.1231,3.6318,1.2163,1.7555,1.8586,0.6692,8.3143,0.4176,1.0186,2.8627,1.8639,5.7413,0.633,3.0613,0.7953,5.592,4.8624,2.0377,2.3133,0.0547,5.5515,4.1539,0.224,2.1888,2.4897,0.665,5.6306,2.1785,0.2213,2.0379,0.0064,3.6434,0.7982,2.1657,0.2594,2.3178,2.0661,1.2154,1.6374,4.3067,5.4878,0.363,5.5432,3.0743,0.0039,2.1841,9.0048,0.56,0.7763,2.1888,4.7,5.6303,4.093,5.1323,2.6227,0.6136,3.9616,0.0361,6.0729,6.8921,5.9992,1.7308,4.121,0.0167,7.3062,3.631,4.2842,4.6298,5.1995,2.433,0.8651,0.7807,1.4263,0.2702,0.2074,5.4255,0.4598,2.1865,1.9817,0.5419]}

But he acknowledged that his men were doing too much, and that they had made mistakes.\nThey have been accused of murdering innocent civilians and killing as many as 80 drug suspects in one night in operations that have also killed police officers in a crackdown on the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.\nBut his men have also been accused of torturing suspects and using excessive violence, and were hit back by the international media and a vocal public who called for their removal or resignation.\nThe police chief s office is leading the review and has announced that the director of operations, Colonel Francisco Domagoso, would leave the unit this month.\n\" I want justice for those murdered, that they are punished, that justice be done for those who died in the course of duty,\" said Domagoso.\nBut he warned that the review would not be limited to the deaths of suspects, which have already prompted a probe by the police s investigative board. The probe is investigating the deaths of 12 suspects killed by the unit over the past month.\nBaron Samedi himself has tried to keep a low profile, but said that \" there was a plan being organised to kill me \", referring to an apparent suicide attack that his office believes was staged to kill him.\n\" The police have an objective to fight crime, and we will continue to do our part in that \", said Samedi.\nHowever, he refused to say if the police would increase gun confiscations on the streets of the capital city Manila and other parts of the country, saying only that \" they have enough \" now.\n\" They have enough to confiscate the weapons of the drug dealers, so it is not necessary to confiscate the guns of law-abiding citizens.\"","token_len":442,"entropy":[7.2658,3.1049,2.3858,1.8531,7.0738,4.9719,1.782,7.9753,0.5887,1.6362,7.3704,0.0549,1.7784,7.8936,5.0845,5.7913,8.1103,0.0028,2.7857,2.0684,0.6688,1.0712,11.0652,9.4617,2.2069,0.0538,1.2506,1.1027,5.9702,7.2047,3.7655,2.979,1.4392,0.0261,1.2194,0.0006,2.5537,1.8424,6.4167,0.0675,2.8644,1.8016,0.5987,4.8901,1.3784,3.5871,5.4981,0.0642,2.3863,0.2696,0.2237,17.524,5.9563,4.8949,8.1881,3.6773,2.0222,1.4704,4.2839,5.322,1.176,3.97,1.2758,7.5138,1.6205,0.4995,2.6295,3.387,3.4663,0.443,2.8657,1.713,4.8375,2.4244,3.3339,2.6546,1.3754,4.5516,0.5325,3.221,3.1079,3.1093,5.4668,0.3033,0.8853,6.2085,0.0309,6.6407,1.6889,2.0729,4.2281,0.5005,4.4604,0.7926,4.1436,0.738,3.9997,3.9884,1.4643,4.4622,4.7113,1.2472,2.3093,1.2094,1.7643,1.8375,1.5524,3.9312,0.71,0.4034,0.1787,7.8536,3.8401,1.7928,1.9591,0.154,4.4821,6.9915,2.9363,1.5095,4.0191,5.7387,0.0103,0.0191,3.6198,2.5947,1.7687,1.311,4.2546,3.8213,1.3381,8.0444,1.3482,1.4727,5.1538,1.8944,4.5889,1.0505,2.4466,4.1145,4.7138,0.5783,2.4323,7.7663,3.5988,0.0325,0.0428,1.098,0.3628,3.7833,4.3399,4.1301,1.2779,2.0166,1.0906,0.4173,0.0364,5.6854,0.0005,3.0489,1.3737,3.8153,2.9501,6.4859,2.1719,2.2712,4.1523,7.4787,6.8569,1.0494,2.0639,4.9834,3.5952,2.7889,4.3776,7.123,2.8665,5.1487,2.2841,0.6957,1.6077,3.1921,5.5093,4.6984,0.2296,0.2072,2.1007,3.4353,0.1161,9.5185,3.8007,4.3012,6.5143,1.0059,5.9563,3.2183,2.4607,5.1437,1.4785,1.8918,6.6249,1.1951,3.8613,1.3985,5.0458,5.6448,8.8648,5.6063,5.6112,0.2177,2.4556,3.9874,1.441,2.739,3.2284,1.0581,0.5874,0.6263,2.2757,10.642,3.4419,7.1729,0.9805,2.8288,5.9365,2.0077,4.0546,2.1535,1.7763,4.6489,1.6437,1.1687,4.5159,3.1469,1.0441,1.7961,1.3764,0.5818,3.6576,2.5434,1.2038,4.491,0.0197,7.1048,0.5648,1.55,3.9224,0.0016,0.0017,1.6644,0.3997,3.5542,1.5119,3.9848,0.3969,1.2463,4.0984,1.0542,1.3615,1.6488,5.5143,0.0764,0.9451,4.2677,0.2365,3.0973,1.5952,3.24,2.0995,3.7842,3.7371,2.4208,5.7313,0.6658,0.3896,4.2747,9.2646,5.3415,5.2486,1.1769,3.5613,3.9492,1.7299,5.8417,1.499,2.3585,0.0866,4.6339,1.933,4.9728,2.2918,1.6604,1.9138,3.6964,0.4674,0.8003,3.3823,0.8508,0.2441,4.0713,0.086,0.2585,0.0162,0.0037,8.1149,1.7167,6.7481,0.1253,4.4211,3.5605,0.918,0.0022,1.2054,1.6077,2.0026,1.9108,4.6444,6.5466,3.1302,1.2104,5.4029,5.0993,8.5696,1.1525,2.0117,3.8776,7.3739,3.6164,0.024,4.3201,3.3502,4.0507,3.916,2.5432,4.1387,3.1153,4.886,1.104,3.812,2.1587,3.8453,1.4178,0.2992,0.3217,2.1466,3.2816,3.2887,2.5805,5.0578,3.6063,1.5903,6.0887,2.5875,1.4073,1.6197,2.7558,2.1464,2.6754,0.263,1.6351,2.7179,2.9282,1.7737,2.0589,11.3973,1.6644,0.7463,0.0117,0.0044,0.5017,0.4241,4.9344,0.069,1.074,5.1463,0.0168,1.2206,2.2773,1.2039,2.9091,1.5114,7.426,7.0931,6.1997,2.0942,4.0975,1.7414,2.1116,1.1108,0.847,1.4384,3.8708,3.8917,2.6212,2.8688,1.7446,0.0163,0.3415,0.3653,1.7911,1.9657,1.8539,0.3604,1.9842,3.2271,2.3733,5.2672,3.8343,7.5757,1.179,0.2666,2.0781,3.0475,1.4098,2.7319,2.5649,7.7705,0.0009,2.3095,1.7053,1.7853,1.8281,2.105,3.171,2.1348,3.7196,3.1591,1.0581,1.6944,3.2125,0.8056,2.5287,0.0008,1.8405,2.0056,1.0954,5.5275,1.7401,0.0822,0.3319,4.7128]}

an ally of the Sunnis under the exiled government of former president Mohamed Morsi, who enjoyed the support of the Muslim Brotherhood - launched a campaign to restore the former administration across the country.","token_len":443,"entropy":[4.0322,2.5973,0.4156,6.93,3.6313,1.6339,3.2345,6.2316,3.9885,0.7569,1.336,6.7562,0.0432,0.393,0.4278,3.1912,0.5601,0.9465,0.0545,1.0773,2.0311,0.6992,0.9826,0.7588,0.0,5.0053,0.4787,1.0203,0.254,6.0716,2.1782,1.135,3.0423,3.7122,7.0931,1.2867,4.5234,0.7876,3.4007,3.2195,0.1133,0.1332,0.3739,14.2018,4.6909,1.956,0.523,5.1735,0.819,0.9377,8.1533,6.1476,3.6618,1.849,1.163,1.232,0.2448,2.4597,3.5574,0.4716,0.5239,2.6633,0.0227,0.0421,1.7239,1.338,0.4385,0.9603,1.9491,0.0629,1.8978,4.4299,4.7844,0.1124,1.384,3.4736,3.8878,1.8209,5.4548,0.0678,0.0457,1.9564,3.9484,2.835,0.2047,3.7479,2.5984,2.6099,1.083,0.0019,0.0019,0.0014,0.0001,0.9604,3.5345,0.1161,0.3082,1.476,6.7709,1.9716,5.5252,2.785,5.6415,4.1115,3.9737,2.0746,0.0443,4.8185,2.2708,3.5405,1.2873,1.6937,2.7073,1.7143,1.5658,3.6829,5.0186,5.306,5.2123,10.4353,5.6615,6.74,4.9153,1.5655,4.6343,3.1395,6.0051,0.3251,5.1186,4.9098,2.3803,2.2946,0.7047,0.2291,4.3862,2.2214,0.2482,1.5429,6.587,0.8399,5.4211,4.7149,0.9005,5.1682,5.9198,1.5782,1.9262,1.6497,0.1629,1.9469,4.1123,0.1908,3.4814,3.1505,1.9684,1.4481,7.1494,6.4039,3.9445,5.5758,3.4452,0.8329,0.9507,2.1663,9.1992,0.987,1.6791,0.3573,4.4443,0.0085,1.511,6.0295,0.1722,0.5829,1.7658,6.4986,1.1391,5.7702,5.9785,5.8996,5.8326,0.0281,1.2961,1.2149,2.0013,6.6206,2.1093,1.9712,6.0958,0.0992,0.0085,0.9149,0.6239,2.2451,2.35,3.6724,2.8447,0.8489,4.4555,3.6626,6.3639,0.8136,1.6177,4.1471,0.3588,0.3979,5.9833,0.4082,9.2485,2.6903,4.327,1.6099,6.658,4.2521,0.3507,3.6696,0.3818,3.916,0.1437,3.6683,3.0601,1.6768,1.6313,0.126,6.7882,3.7449,0.9258,1.0963,1.1228,1.0454,2.1808,2.1836,2.9069,6.8825,0.0203,6.662,7.9606,5.5539,3.4228,0.2756,0.1738,3.4619,0.0041,5.5241,0.8194,3.6059,0.0456,1.4162,3.7513,4.9915,6.1194,0.0528,4.1723,1.5206,0.7804,3.2138,2.3729,0.8116,1.3657,3.9967,3.0187,1.51,0.0003,4.302,0.7755,4.9057,3.2643,3.3787,1.3328,5.4115,2.9483,0.549,0.292,1.9626,9.8035,1.7988,1.8197,5.5131,1.036,0.4042,2.3871,1.5253,4.0093,3.6828,0.8948,2.3307,1.528,4.8553,1.8042,0.3929,1.4035,1.7135,1.0265,4.5175,3.287,0.1353,4.2618,2.5492,2.2313,3.9049,0.9105,1.4871,2.9354,1.5453,1.5941,4.3787,0.8079,2.8316,0.0006,2.5205,1.9528,6.5132,3.126,1.0595,0.7638,4.9015,0.1039,2.281,4.5088,0.8587,6.3794,1.1647,6.7535,2.5251,3.5668,0.6328,2.8948,1.4866,4.9177,1.675,0.7479,1.6259,4.2093,2.2885,2.2521,3.6162,4.1875,0.35,1.1845,6.1232,0.0015,2.484,2.8715,0.4759,1.3873,1.4379,1.7958,5.1262,1.1666,0.9418,0.1224,1.9497,2.6876,0.5121,1.6873,2.7365,3.2377,0.1478,0.9979,0.6938,1.7168,4.821,2.6635,1.025,1.1102,4.345,3.3495,0.866,4.8885,3.4308,2.0223,1.623,2.5323,2.2793,4.8525,0.1787,1.7047,1.0005,4.4934,1.7677,0.6724,2.8835,1.2363,0.7541,6.1579,1.1408,1.3003,0.0113,0.2196,0.1826,0.0011,1.425,4.5453,5.2632,0.0074,0.5639,0.0507,1.7479,1.8946,0.7212,2.2066,0.0989,3.2131,0.1362,6.278,4.142,0.2775,0.1685,0.4624,8.1432,0.0016,5.958,1.031,6.6079,3.2668,1.0584,1.8805,1.2161,6.215,1.1435,4.814,1.0713,8.1558,3.5912,0.5644,0.0195,1.1157,3.1609,0.0422,0.344,3.3528,0.8215,2.6669,1.3506,3.5987,1.6169,4.1768,7.0123,9.4485,0.4182,1.2026,0.4771]}

Trudeau told reporters in Halifax, Nova Scotia, that while he wanted to talk to the United States about NAFTA, he would not be making any kind of commitment to it until he talked to the U.S. president and U.S. Trade Representative. In an interview with Reuters TV on Thursday, President Trump accused the U.S. government of dragging its feet on a rehashed agreement that he said could affect jobs and jobs in the United States. In a major break from the past four decades of free trade in North America, Trump has proposed adding an unspecified, but potentially unwise clause that would allow Ottawa to use tariffs in the event of noncompliance with NAFTA terms.\nTrudeau also said he would be willing to negotiate more deeply on security and foreign policy issues. The prime minister pointed to the fact that he has been able to get agreement from the Conservative opposition party for some areas, he did not say what those areas were. \u201cWe will be doing that,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cBecause it comes at a price, it is a price that you cannot afford to undervalue.\nA member of the National Hockey League\u2019s Toronto Maple Leafs has been charged with assault on a police officer after a confrontation in January.The Toronto Raptors star Kyle Lowry has been charged with assault after striking a police officer during a confrontation outside a bar. In a police report, which was released Friday, Toronto police said Lowry confronted a police officer after they were denied access to a party, and the altercation then led to the player striking the officer.

He also wants to end Obama\u2019s requirement that federal health care funds and resources go to state-run programs \u2014 something that would undermine state Medicaid programs.\nThese are just two of the major proposed changes Trump has made in line with his campaign promise to end Obamacare: \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d But it is not clear whether he will go further. He has already said he will eliminate what he calls Obamacare\u2019s \u201chorrible and complex\u201d regulations.\nThe health care overhaul law also requires the creation of new state-run programs that help low-income households afford health insurance. But he has said he will not give states a big injection of new money if the program doesn\u2019t meet its goals. In a White House letter issued last week, he said he was \u201cnot going to force states to get it done.\u201d He has also said he would not extend Obama\u2019s waiver for insurers that don\u2019t offer affordable coverage to people who don\u2019t have health coverage.\nThe most troubling changes, though, relate to what people with health conditions call Medicaid \u201cdisproportionate share\u201d payments that help states provide these services. The bill also includes changes that would affect people eligible for Medicare.\n\u201cPeople are going to lose protections,\u201d said Kevin McDonough, the president and CEO of the American Medical Association. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be under attack from the president.\u201d","token_len":444,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,4.8571,11.5287,8.1841,0.1424,0.584,1.4311,1.3495,5.3777,3.0263,0.0006,2.9347,4.878,1.7006,5.7035,1.4064,0.6631,0.1983,6.3945,0.0432,8.9164,1.0186,4.9977,3.3393,1.0168,1.734,6.0607,4.6866,10.126,1.8183,0.6648,3.3501,4.5942,0.0051,0.5776,0.2162,18.7019,8.5384,7.2385,3.9076,4.1193,4.9494,0.5525,0.1717,8.3492,5.0433,5.9888,2.1368,2.3613,2.4338,4.333,4.2177,4.2281,5.2126,0.263,2.4483,5.7553,0.4616,5.7951,1.5315,4.9641,8.5088,7.0971,11.6826,3.4417,6.284,1.8824,7.395,6.2598,5.3558,5.8506,10.206,0.163,1.4951,1.7073,0.2948,0.1836,0.0453,2.1105,0.0069,1.9798,0.6993,0.4481,0.3427,0.0117,0.3991,5.0243,0.5218,3.5884,3.9205,10.5767,2.7619,5.7349,1.8044,2.9156,1.3203,1.1519,1.1418,4.2035,3.3325,4.6172,2.9155,2.7828,6.0527,6.9343,1.8784,1.5561,1.0903,2.6523,1.3884,3.893,1.2069,5.2477,5.1224,0.3038,4.714,2.253,5.7693,0.6808,6.4908,0.9492,2.4453,2.6781,0.0419,0.0739,6.0301,1.6713,6.0823,1.8281,2.3934,3.5828,0.4684,5.9277,1.0885,1.7172,2.0412,0.2191,0.1029,3.8525,5.3409,6.4897,0.5745,0.2502,4.3392,0.1194,4.3602,1.8928,1.0863,2.3022,6.9421,5.521,1.8099,0.4345,4.6443,3.0523,1.1905,2.0977,5.208,2.4751,0.9262,2.2632,4.501,5.6508,3.0059,0.7239,1.0905,0.4618,9.2007,1.4009,2.9721,2.267,0.3408,1.0002,3.1383,6.7907,0.9964,2.9166,1.1742,2.8385,2.4157,8.9341,0.0042,0.6605,2.431,1.2761,0.3552,3.7025,1.5193,4.4428,7.4003,1.5807,5.3364,4.3461,0.0658,0.041,1.6608,0.8757,2.7627,5.2161,2.8689,1.4274,1.8388,1.7158,2.1829,1.6441,1.142,3.8301,2.4913,1.398,4.141,0.9773,3.193,1.9351,0.5498,1.1367,4.502,6.6643,0.7054,0.7082,3.8227,5.5831,0.0389,0.2078,11.1873,2.9195,9.5244,1.1891,3.7687,6.694,4.4292,3.1573,3.5762,1.7326,1.0407,2.8786,4.8858,0.5662,3.4717,5.5798,3.8858,3.3805,2.561,5.5062,0.0111,2.3538,4.929,0.6467,0.3977,2.7542,1.8481,3.3746,1.0836,0.0338,0.0958,3.8548,2.3842,1.0461,0.8543,0.6558,2.8426,3.5328,0.8377,1.4881,0.654,0.7042,1.7367,4.882,1.619,3.148,5.9954,7.4008,0.0669,4.7498,0.3991,4.0639,2.9901,3.9082,2.4535,3.151,1.4299,0.1127,3.8527,2.6833,1.7971,0.3122,3.9398,2.3802,5.6272,0.0013,4.3322,5.4022,2.0943,0.4872,0.1379,2.2012,0.6804,1.0646,3.2739,7.6868,1.2813,2.3864,1.6249,0.0188,5.5311,0.2779,0.0485,4.4895,6.5056,1.1553,1.1026,4.9748,1.6649,3.2077,1.7811,1.1306,0.4425,0.3668,0.897,1.6729,5.6732,5.1431,0.7965,0.0089,0.0151,6.966,2.8295,5.1374,1.3595,3.1306,0.6323,0.0642,0.1813,1.6982,3.8963,0.8565,0.8004,2.5702,1.6944,1.8919,0.085,0.0294,0.264,1.1445,1.8325,2.3334,0.4065,0.3516,2.4238,4.3723,5.127,3.5981,3.47,2.6421,0.0176,6.6459,0.0373,4.1873,5.5929,3.1223,2.7653,5.091,3.3323,3.6066,5.9879,0.7224,3.631,4.771,0.0024,0.2657,1.2384,2.9625,0.6708,5.5722,3.9718,2.5263,3.231,2.7062,6.8848,1.3497,0.8023,2.4697,4.6606,2.7908,3.3927,3.4879,1.641,0.5442,4.656,3.1657,5.9097,0.1633,5.0213,3.282,1.0009,2.644,0.3129,5.2551,4.8216,3.4005,0.0478,1.9232,7.237,3.2443,2.7686,0.7128,1.1308,5.3718,5.4544,3.8038,0.0308,0.078,3.0331,2.1838,2.606,0.4392,0.0145,0.7422,1.8009,2.1808,0.0531,0.6089,3.055,0.0739,1.9512,5.3256,0.7431,3.3414,0.0753,0.0069,1.413,4.6999,3.8392,2.2231,2.0759,3.5758,1.7355,1.3927,0.6785]}

This is just because of how energy-intensive and polluting fossil fuels are, as reported by Financial Times.","token_len":444,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,7.5864,6.7042,1.4681,3.1408,2.9068,0.0559,5.819,3.8934,0.1712,3.4994,0.1372,3.2696,6.6777,1.2612,10.4187,0.0548,0.2919,0.0833,8.9497,1.7406,5.334,4.7768,2.2349,3.834,0.9404,3.8045,9.0774,4.4283,0.028,1.7824,2.1019,1.2068,4.781,3.4205,4.7803,5.9113,12.0952,1.5091,16.0679,3.6567,3.9034,8.0866,4.94,8.2643,1.9901,6.1135,7.0036,0.9586,0.3493,7.8019,1.0026,2.1425,3.5867,3.507,3.168,3.908,2.3998,1.2567,1.5692,4.655,3.1313,0.9884,1.4248,9.7165,8.3747,6.4787,0.6821,3.4355,2.0689,1.3796,0.5238,0.2246,6.0517,15.2078,5.4944,6.3544,0.4381,1.6257,4.2945,0.5222,5.663,0.8801,2.6965,3.2851,2.0678,0.5959,2.7751,3.6823,0.3391,8.614,2.597,6.5341,0.1304,6.6347,2.9753,2.2492,3.0149,1.313,0.5103,10.3904,7.4529,6.8522,3.7178,5.1852,3.9289,1.2925,0.0197,2.6185,1.4878,4.8091,3.2295,2.7359,2.5883,6.4254,2.4334,4.7782,0.3399,1.0772,2.0437,11.9808,12.8191,4.2594,7.1738,4.0278,3.8291,2.8193,6.6269,9.6083,0.8427,0.9548,3.1293,3.4232,0.1862,0.323,2.5524,3.5215,1.8783,2.9562,0.0107,1.8859,6.1682,0.336,3.0846,6.5157,2.8559,0.0085,2.1369,2.4694,5.2822,1.7229,0.0413,8.183,9.197,3.9489,0.5119,0.0563,4.9168,1.7998,5.1314,0.5262,2.0146,6.3966,1.3054,10.9365,2.21,1.6592,4.1738,4.4146,1.8703,0.8525,6.9158,2.6942,7.5608,3.4925,0.4804,5.5601,2.7131,5.5248,1.0918,0.3762,4.7239,1.7582,1.0988,3.3467,1.4739,6.0028,1.828,4.2396,4.1723,3.6825,0.5838,1.8667,9.3368,1.7029,0.2286,2.6533,9.5826,0.0516,0.035,2.9826,4.711,2.8942,0.4516,3.4731,3.3182,2.5589,0.0848,0.4721,1.3736,1.6439,2.8495,6.7429,0.0698,4.6158,2.6482,3.3786,2.0386,2.6931,7.0282,1.5214,9.0189,4.4484,3.436,7.1932,4.4173,5.3779,2.7103,1.4108,6.9776,7.917,1.4066,3.0664,4.6901,0.3879,3.3905,1.5731,10.2037,0.7527,0.8849,3.884,7.3062,0.0392,0.7094,6.2737,4.1194,0.2369,6.1044,3.1181,5.556,0.0371,3.0537,5.6503,0.4373,6.8219,5.6081,0.0054,1.498,0.0189,0.9504,4.9127,1.4179,1.6162,6.5096,0.0436,0.9059,3.1244,5.5363,2.1776,3.8661,0.0755,0.0629,2.1883,1.3603,5.9263,7.0915,4.92,1.002,0.3,1.0583,3.185,4.1293,4.6351,0.4263,5.7486,3.1822,0.0416,2.7768,0.6611,3.252,4.7587,0.9836,0.259,3.4168,16.7754,8.0302,0.8067,7.802,2.4975,1.7982,2.8243,1.2363,1.3883,0.0016,0.4797,8.3358,2.4257,3.4246,0.0304,0.0169,2.8829,2.6334,0.0399,0.9404,0.9391,0.0226,0.0212,0.3012,1.1192,3.2603,7.0802,0.0732,5.4727,4.2792,6.8684,0.6401,9.6635,0.957,2.0512,2.5161,6.4487,0.5881,0.0122,6.3757,5.1037,1.3154,1.0712,2.9138,1.7307,5.5442,7.9381,3.7971,0.6463,2.033,1.9427,0.9148,1.2551,0.17,2.6275,7.5037,4.4696,1.3956,5.3093,0.582,1.976,2.7061,5.3986,3.8988,2.6023,3.44,5.8551,5.2094,1.2607,0.2865,1.0798,0.8349,1.2124,0.3406,0.0536,1.9211,6.6779,4.8581,1.1266,3.2471,7.1112,6.6893,0.4451,0.2997,1.9546,0.4913,2.4759,3.8878,1.7041,5.4589,0.1169,0.4456,1.9978,4.9192,0.0992,5.796,5.0684,4.8753,0.0056,6.6685,3.635,0.6056,1.5523,3.1089,4.1266,3.0029,3.3083,4.3722,9.5081,5.4113,15.3643,2.8709,3.4233,6.0719,4.535,2.3848,3.1951,4.78,0.3593,3.4973,0.0334,1.3503,3.9397,1.6213,4.3797,8.2526,1.789,4.2536,5.9555,3.6022,1.2152,3.3376,4.6482,0.0207,3.6876,0.3283,0.2461,1.9317,3.1307,4.8147,0.4051,8.1954,0.1115,1.6614]}
{"prompt":"A major Nigerian oil union suspended a nationwide strike on Monday , the same day it began , after a dispute resolution ended with a domestic oil and gas company recalling laid off staff ,","text":"A major Nigerian oil union suspended a nationwide strike on Monday, the same day it began, after a dispute resolution ended with a domestic oil and gas company recalling laid off staff, Reuters reports. Nigeria\u2019s Petroleum Products Pricing and Regulatory Agency, which oversees the distribution of petrol and gasoline in the country, announced in a notice to customers at all its gas stations that they were no longer to charge an extra charge on the minimum price. The strike began on Wednesday after workers said they were being stripped of their rights. But a resolution reached between the union and TransNet Limited, a subsidiary of Anglo-Dutch energy company Shell, has ended the strike. In a statement, the union said it would resume its action again on Friday if Shell didn\u2019t give workers the salary and allowances they were promised. \u201cIf it couldn\u2019t guarantee the full implementation of the agreement, then the national strike will be called again,\u201d said Adeem B. Adamu, chairman of the union. The union said it had suspended its action following the return of workers from a one-day lockout. The union, the Nigeria Labour Congress\u2019 National Association of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, says it is demanding better working conditions for those who have been laid off. Shell said Monday that the strike had cut exports and reduced fuel production. The action ended a day later on Monday when workers were given their bonus of 150,000 naira per head for each week of strike. The union accused Shell of cutting workers\u2019 allowances and deducting bonuses. The union says it has cut its output from just over 1 million barrels per day at the start of the strike last week to about 450,000 barrels per day after the company cut pay. It says about 40 percent of Shell employees have been affected. TransNet Limited, which is Shell\u2019s Nigerian unit, said it was giving workers what they were promised by the company\u2019s Nigerian managers through the resolution. \u201cThe company is determined to ensure that all employees including those who are on notice are paid their outstanding salaries on July 9,\u201d said Nnamdi Okwuagwu, the spokesman., which publishes the Nigerian Stock Exchange Index.","token_len":444,"entropy":[7.8995,11.5075,3.9198,9.1351,9.1988,2.5471,5.2128,0.8679,1.0136,1.8348,1.2008,3.88,3.7078,0.0139,3.0597,4.6509,5.8309,2.9519,2.1052,4.7665,8.3802,9.8223,1.5009,2.1843,9.1851,3.3241,4.7629,0.1056,0.9391,7.5081,13.7775,1.9394,4.1195,2.611,5.6897,1.6354,0.0575,5.7789,16.6406,8.2108,3.3548,4.1693,5.755,11.6365,2.1984,3.8825,2.9829,2.9161,1.6282,1.7614,0.8935,5.8454,0.5104,6.945,0.7987,6.6151,1.6112,0.6304,0.2087,0.0784,3.2676,4.1188,0.4934,4.9219,2.4827,3.4507,5.8728,7.9837,1.6573,4.6105,0.2812,0.4409,2.0977,2.3685,2.8248,0.0008,6.657,5.2963,4.6796,1.6181,2.9744,3.1365,2.6201,6.6096,2.5638,2.1321,1.6465,3.7344,2.9375,1.5197,3.523,2.9268,3.8476,3.9578,0.6185,1.2261,2.8687,7.0959,0.1342,0.3447,2.007,2.1321,5.7007,3.0609,7.5926,4.9287,3.7745,0.7491,2.4751,0.125,8.2186,7.2295,5.3077,1.1325,1.4349,1.3744,0.0149,7.04,0.978,0.2969,3.9913,1.4712,3.4195,0.2833,2.5376,5.7494,1.2557,1.6106,0.6533,4.0193,0.9353,0.427,0.4828,1.2426,1.7704,0.2712,1.1812,1.906,4.4713,2.1367,4.1254,6.9154,0.7647,1.8688,3.5604,4.679,4.783,9.1672,0.704,0.215,4.5628,4.7396,2.0805,7.7973,2.4655,4.5736,0.3928,1.8813,1.4624,0.5099,6.1225,5.0141,7.3064,3.7512,5.8404,0.1659,1.1503,0.0129,5.8523,1.7564,4.442,6.6865,0.0333,0.5561,3.0811,0.3907,3.3,1.6792,5.8581,2.7703,2.6613,1.9553,4.4211,3.4326,2.0868,10.0716,7.9558,1.9551,8.5891,9.9184,4.6544,3.5911,8.0057,2.8745,0.3249,4.3303,0.0718,0.4846,2.1743,1.164,2.0474,2.5142,1.3309,1.0748,1.9302,4.4772,1.8824,3.8295,4.6048,1.2181,8.3222,0.0917,3.4596,1.7781,2.4056,5.7975,0.1091,0.5162,5.5027,1.9008,1.7773,2.9482,3.2754,4.1089,3.5779,3.0711,4.474,4.0275,0.2299,8.4188,2.5106,0.2447,3.5793,3.262,2.4446,0.3814,1.2453,0.7714,4.5091,1.1857,1.7264,2.9529,4.3714,3.5612,0.0087,1.5529,3.9055,1.3185,2.6817,0.8989,1.8994,0.0111,0.6758,6.7112,1.3588,4.4576,0.7976,2.3256,1.8767,2.1805,7.9367,8.6494,2.8595,3.5915,4.5863,4.2463,1.3886,1.7476,6.0004,5.1162,1.7224,4.2486,5.7147,3.2811,0.7489,2.1555,2.0545,2.719,3.1683,3.7136,7.8283,3.4388,5.3164,0.6069,0.026,4.3643,0.44,0.4165,3.8351,5.256,2.7367,3.7379,3.9186,2.0845,3.7561,2.12,1.5705,2.1219,6.026,1.3332,0.1397,4.3422,2.3983,7.5196,0.1267,12.7987,1.1766,8.5376,0.06,5.2424,1.4439,1.5337,2.0196,2.3429,1.3163,1.8375,4.9098,2.1506,4.1767,2.911,5.7717,1.3214,2.4833,1.1183,0.2501,1.0337,0.0144,5.0468,1.4361,2.5872,0.0202,0.6373,1.1267,4.4755,1.1246,1.0381,2.6084,5.0949,0.0229,0.0053,0.3938,0.5168,0.0255,4.4104,1.5773,2.93,3.1899,5.6787,1.5501,2.75,1.4989,5.6416,3.5029,1.4694,0.0299,3.5458,4.3017,2.4048,1.0009,3.2061,1.3193,5.6433,0.2581,2.4821,1.6238,0.7458,2.2921,4.7434,5.5252,0.015,0.3255,5.621,3.9954,0.2135,0.8953,1.0805,1.7532,6.3924,1.3366,5.2883,1.763,2.1402,0.5561,2.917,0.7753,2.3994,4.9601,0.0237,0.6566,4.7623,5.2897,7.1151,1.9448,6.4882,0.7032,3.44,0.2154,1.6667,1.9812,2.4092,7.0356,0.2203,3.4267,0.7997,2.3489,1.9097,8.0686,1.2455,1.1105,1.494,3.7921,7.4738,2.0241,0.8711,2.0761,8.3135,1.4884,4.4783,7.2056,4.5016,1.1695,3.3534,1.9254,0.9539,5.2347,6.9586,0.1119,6.3348,4.536,5.9871,1.6148,0.2014,2.1283,4.4064,11.7592,3.319,8.0982,0.7636,3.7436,7.3601,0.2361,5.6254,0.5719]}

The Baghdad-based embassy said the news of the government shutdown of the KBS \"has been met with deep concern by the U.S. Embassy\" in a statement.\n\"We are concerned by the closure of Al-Baghdadiya TV that was an important voice of the independence movement and that played a very important role in communicating the situation on the ground, especially in the areas of violence against civilians,\" said the embassy statement, which quoted the ambassador as saying.\nThe statement went on to say that the U.S. Embassy \"would continue to work closely with the KBS.\" It also asked the KBS and PUK to \"immediately communicate to the international community that the KBS will continue to broadcast on its frequencies.\"\nThe KBS, which is controlled by a local Kurdish news agency, said through a spokesman that the Baghdad Central Television had ordered that KBS' station in Baghdad be shut down in an effort to \"punish\" the broadcaster for \"provoking sectarian rivalries in the capital\" and for having a \"non-independence and non-Islamic outlook.\"","token_len":445,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2007,0.2289,3.7901,2.1032,1.8252,2.1015,1.9176,1.3143,4.6378,2.1213,1.1248,7.523,0.1707,2.0294,5.4467,4.9234,6.8139,6.6321,0.7172,3.9051,0.0006,3.3583,3.0449,3.123,0.0535,8.1301,0.6872,2.065,0.2825,9.9616,2.0102,2.4742,1.8105,0.4293,1.9112,0.1045,5.1308,0.7999,3.5797,0.9467,0.2463,3.8408,2.0845,4.9283,1.9959,6.876,1.6229,4.0767,1.7626,2.6527,6.1223,0.4112,1.8457,2.4767,1.8086,0.0009,0.0134,0.0463,0.8364,0.6492,0.0961,0.7514,3.1532,1.4803,4.4864,8.1088,0.7029,0.7916,1.3058,3.346,1.0326,3.1209,0.9814,1.1353,2.842,7.9922,4.1827,4.1606,1.9398,2.5225,7.2059,3.3632,1.8269,1.3011,1.1228,8.82,4.2321,2.1012,8.6471,10.467,1.5074,0.0009,0.0075,0.0858,0.7291,0.2803,0.0833,0.2062,4.2369,0.4215,0.0154,0.0082,4.654,0.0232,0.0111,0.0011,2.2257,0.0053,0.0023,0.0667,0.0264,0.0016,0.0009,0.0009,6.2975,1.2022,0.1638,0.0106,0.0011,0.0092,0.0025,9.9923,0.4188,2.0145,8.9577,0.7212,1.7812,0.3829,0.0044,0.0018,0.0029,0.0171,0.0969,0.0039,0.0526,0.0002,0.0034,0.0436,0.0103,0.0068,0.0005,0.016,0.0055,0.0059,0.0022,0.0009,0.0006,0.0023,0.0025,0.0019,0.0004,1.7474,1.6528,1.3404,0.6845,0.0006,0.005,0.0048,5.4383,2.9111,0.8974,2.251,3.1658,0.4179,4.9501,4.9278,1.2097,1.909,4.8719,5.2054,1.6138,0.7513,2.846,2.2391,0.9552,4.5069,5.9668,0.9898,5.9967,0.0674,2.5231,4.7137,2.4813,5.075,7.8979,3.0739,4.7423,2.3474,0.4108,4.5215,0.4085,5.1394,0.0767,1.1406,4.8215,2.787,0.1069,1.1244,3.0785,3.1011,6.0371,0.1622,2.9028,0.5217,2.2518,1.8601,3.6278,6.1783,1.3907,4.0977,7.4388,0.8724,5.1373,0.9992,0.1478,5.5337,3.4328,0.6399,2.2584,6.4268,1.5367,0.4229,10.0388,1.0185,1.6914,4.0972,2.2968,0.1038,4.821,3.1809,3.8371,1.8506,4.7338,4.8137,5.3553,2.1546,2.6953,3.5411,0.1369,5.2154,0.6983,1.8991,0.8922,2.6275,0.0008,0.0058,0.3384,1.7727,3.9717,1.3685,6.0252,0.3584,0.7558,0.8571,2.7703,1.4915,0.9989,0.6791,0.7155,0.0617,0.4369,0.0275,0.6075,0.0028,0.0409,0.0009,0.0045,0.0005,0.2312,0.1899,0.016,0.0253,0.0002,0.0005,0.0022,0.0033,0.0079,0.0026,4.2475,2.3653,8.237,0.2478,5.0764,0.4609,0.0798,0.0822,8.9781,1.0599,3.0154,3.6095,0.4161,0.0715,3.0619,2.6868,1.2729,0.7537,3.3774,1.1706,7.286,3.9902,2.985,1.2995,2.1965,0.9527,0.8117,1.3175,2.1764,0.7274,5.3341,1.6365,3.5437,0.5421,0.0268,0.4356,0.6833,0.9766,4.7198,3.9809,0.0172,0.0419,0.4427,0.4034,0.8449,1.3192,0.0006,0.0041,0.0729,1.6654,2.4235,3.6363,1.0509,0.0661,2.3561,1.1751,0.0525,0.7803,4.676,0.0221,6.01,2.8418,2.2891,5.2774,1.2167,3.9801,0.0124,3.8477,3.7059,0.0051,0.8136,1.8201,4.4406,0.0689,6.003,2.4566,0.5613,3.9307,0.031,2.1396,0.9106,3.1721,0.0069,2.8915,2.0108,0.3206,2.6403,2.858,1.7441,8.3002,2.7947,0.4295,0.9639,2.9935,0.0032,2.6585,0.6365,1.8242,3.9917,0.0523,2.9574,3.9216,0.7846,7.624,1.4192,0.3755,2.5047,7.6992,0.8671,1.1888,0.3007,1.319,6.6506,9.0518,2.2416,3.9359,5.2565,3.7314,4.2508,0.0102,3.8156,3.7798,3.5073,2.0242,1.4951,1.0066,0.218,3.6768,2.4675,0.8204,0.0253,2.466,7.6287,0.0201,2.3221,0.5025,3.7245,1.1406,2.4243,4.2858,0.6455,2.6626,7.3261,0.0167,2.2865,0.5484,6.4286,3.8125,1.0657,2.5817,5.3462,2.1337,0.6753,5.6765,0.106,6.1816,4.3383,2.2039,0.0161,4.2619,4.4352,0.4212]}

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley also said on Thursday that any deal must include strong sanctions on North Korea.\nThe North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not mention his father\u2019s name at his welcome speech after he took office as president of North Korea this month. North Korean officials did not say if Kim Jong-un had a son, also known as Kim Yong Nam, whom he named the North\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. in 2017.\nNorth Korea\u2019s state-run KCNA said Wednesday evening that Kim was pleased with \u201cachievements in recent economic, technological and cultural programs.\u201d\nHe called for closer ties in scientific research and technology and the development of industrial relations. Kim said he was looking forward to strengthening socialist collaboration with China and Vietnam and expanding the North\u2019s relations with countries in Africa.\nOn Monday, North Korea\u2019s Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un appointed his uncle, Kim Yong Nam, as head of Pyongyang\u2019s embassy in Washington, as reported by the Yonhap news agency. A month prior, Kim Jong Un himself was named acting ambassador over the death of his brother, Kim Jong Nam.\nThe move came after the murder of Kim Jong Nam in February on a South Korean airport. The suspect is now in custody, and police believe him to be an ex-nuclear scientist.\nKim became North Korean president in late 2011 after the ill-fated Korean War ended with a truce that saw the United States and North Korea sign an accord committing to a \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d on the Korean peninsula. Kim succeeded his late grandfather as leader of North Korea and has been increasingly seen as the heir to his father\u2019s long-ruling regime. He has taken a closer role in security matters, notably by deploying weapons and troops in South Korea.\nWith a population of about 27 million, Kim\u2019s government controls nearly all of North Korea\u2019s output, while social costs and economic inequality have increased in recent years.","token_len":445,"entropy":[10.9313,3.2284,1.8093,2.0071,0.8114,2.0918,6.6739,5.4568,3.8341,0.8948,9.7892,0.6843,2.1371,0.5482,0.4093,5.058,1.7016,1.2703,6.9898,7.2665,6.5801,5.3309,0.9503,0.4437,1.5251,0.3982,7.641,0.0025,0.18,0.0691,3.0306,0.2809,0.2073,0.456,0.0021,0.0471,0.0001,3.4977,1.181,1.5196,0.7159,0.2429,4.386,3.1608,2.1589,1.749,5.6118,1.1287,1.6326,0.7538,0.0578,0.892,0.4467,14.1506,2.8515,1.0568,1.4807,3.5409,0.0205,1.997,0.1712,5.8802,0.124,4.2847,3.0459,4.8901,16.9778,7.6621,4.243,4.201,3.2383,2.7826,9.246,0.8218,5.035,2.904,2.526,0.6298,4.4889,1.6465,2.8135,1.3449,0.0066,5.1504,1.3813,0.4371,4.2215,1.646,2.3718,4.1291,0.2091,3.4969,2.3427,1.6289,0.4252,0.0172,0.0628,1.8569,3.2829,3.2797,1.7766,7.9765,0.4986,0.0428,0.3858,5.1402,5.3067,0.7526,4.8647,1.2192,2.9978,4.6254,3.9052,16.0091,0.1919,0.045,5.0043,1.0876,0.104,2.3117,0.0006,2.5277,0.0869,2.7259,6.7502,0.2041,0.4024,3.6949,0.27,6.7965,0.0566,0.0198,3.2718,2.8334,0.0365,1.5552,0.0,2.6773,3.8968,5.6282,0.2189,0.6157,3.824,8.265,1.0646,14.7531,4.8957,8.6676,1.7451,0.4004,1.6653,3.2747,8.5384,3.4422,4.6894,0.2927,3.5142,6.5709,1.6042,5.9373,6.9292,0.7774,5.1272,4.0237,1.3667,6.1471,1.3891,4.6765,7.6699,2.2756,0.7633,2.6507,2.7627,3.2901,2.4502,0.0318,5.4825,3.2535,1.4266,4.3293,1.8844,1.8144,2.091,3.5357,0.9039,0.0116,5.0586,9.2022,8.8109,1.8866,2.4409,0.95,7.1048,2.1209,4.241,1.7468,3.5211,9.5421,0.0999,0.0166,5.9824,0.1517,5.7049,1.9717,3.3605,2.2899,0.408,4.3926,3.1457,0.1596,1.9017,0.2989,2.6709,0.0267,0.016,5.4507,0.0803,0.1231,0.0898,0.9278,7.6618,2.3108,3.9051,1.1905,0.5685,4.0436,1.3354,0.1746,0.874,2.7029,0.0037,5.4481,3.1861,0.0191,0.0361,6.2704,0.4748,0.4445,1.8053,4.2959,8.2603,0.1878,1.2249,3.5702,0.0,0.3387,0.0463,0.1628,4.4616,5.1893,4.3269,0.4825,1.0612,2.2538,0.4836,5.7132,1.3782,2.1402,7.1639,3.0565,7.9934,0.7576,3.5434,0.0359,0.8797,2.9267,0.9047,0.4119,0.2539,2.7193,0.5861,0.4981,1.8176,4.7678,2.26,1.382,1.7008,7.5864,0.1223,1.5325,0.4622,1.7139,1.3745,2.8416,4.5853,2.0673,3.2373,0.0302,6.5745,1.4566,1.8524,6.7136,2.9774,3.4806,2.0426,0.5429,2.2715,1.8693,4.5986,2.7379,5.0787,0.1376,0.1173,2.8911,3.7884,0.0334,7.0535,1.1063,0.9883,0.7571,3.9997,6.9008,2.9733,1.3508,2.6806,0.5549,1.8868,2.4761,1.9625,2.3948,8.2264,0.0796,0.0356,0.0002,5.5751,0.1841,2.4873,2.3605,1.8532,1.7777,3.0113,4.5836,1.2696,3.2818,0.009,0.8074,2.1091,0.0185,3.4838,1.2582,2.2535,7.8903,2.0444,2.3647,17.5079,0.6044,6.4363,1.7986,0.0001,0.0311,1.1207,5.3441,4.415,0.9529,1.0974,1.317,0.3288,3.6271,6.457,1.2911,6.7946,2.3728,1.3653,1.4884,1.8895,0.9034,0.0207,2.5313,2.9181,1.3794,6.942,3.7246,0.0842,1.8923,3.6788,1.2656,2.2282,0.3313,3.5974,0.0488,0.0355,7.0417,0.6446,5.9436,0.374,0.916,0.1955,3.6484,1.571,5.0675,1.9749,5.8592,3.1565,0.3573,6.6044,2.6818,1.5214,4.0036,4.0758,4.6344,5.8399,1.7704,4.6303,2.5786,1.7471,0.0573,1.4201,0.4607,4.8178,2.5505,2.2476,0.0748,2.0418,5.2782,0.1424,0.398,3.1398,7.7012,0.0077,0.0031,3.0621,3.3361,3.2334,2.2887,0.3822,0.9623,0.0428,0.7361,0.012,0.0054,7.6572,1.3829,4.0857,7.3465,6.668,2.9011,2.8014,5.0602,1.6566,2.6793,2.5208,0.4188,0.1574,0.2933]}

More than 2,500 people are estimated to be drowned each year while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, said the diplomat. Italy has repeatedly called for an international solution to the growing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean. While the proposal was not endorsed by the full U.N. General Assembly this year, it was backed by some 54 countries at the European Union Foreign Foreign Affairs Council meeting last month, the diplomat said. The Italian government also offered EU aid for setting up the new operation center, though Italian officials have said little on the proposal beyond confirming its existence, the diplomat said. The Libyan source said the Italian government had proposed that the operation center would be located in the Libyan capital of Tripoli. The proposal, however, had not been formally agreed upon and further discussion would be necessary to settle on a specific location, the source added. The Libyan government says it is running out of space at the Tripoli center where approximately 2,000 migrants are currently housed. About 600 migrants and migrants' relatives have also been given temporary residency in a nearby hotel and have not been relocated out of the city, the source said. A Libyan humanitarian aid official in Tripoli confirmed the facility had been established on Saturday, but insisted he would not reveal its exact location. \" It is about a month ago since people are here,\" the official said. \"There have been no discussions with the Italian or foreign delegations on who will be stationed here. We welcome support.\"\nWhat a difference a year makes! After weeks of chasing down potential candidates and talking with the former CFO and the current COO to ensure that they understood why their resignation was imminent, I was ready to call off my search for a new CFO yesterday. But then the boss called and made the decision to fill the position with a new candidate. It was a last-minute announcement and came out of left field. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but I accepted and I\u2019m excited for the new hire.","token_len":445,"entropy":[8.34,9.5514,7.306,1.0361,0.9364,2.9061,0.871,0.714,7.0686,3.7709,8.9024,1.8855,2.6785,0.3017,5.1842,0.4851,3.998,5.0972,4.83,1.7709,7.4838,7.1642,4.0397,1.8069,5.4565,4.8279,0.6522,0.0006,2.711,0.0502,3.7778,4.8605,0.7415,7.2322,0.3567,1.9397,3.3249,0.0016,1.1889,4.6641,3.7561,3.1014,1.39,3.7571,3.713,1.0833,6.6565,0.1701,3.0069,0.0557,1.6833,1.2797,2.8485,2.3306,0.0198,1.4606,8.0632,2.754,1.0085,5.1663,1.4815,0.0025,0.7147,0.5036,0.1933,2.1981,3.2902,0.8719,0.8648,4.8991,0.8873,2.5748,0.924,3.7648,1.9942,4.8074,3.0502,0.5622,2.6437,2.4191,5.0771,0.3699,0.3571,6.1797,4.0029,0.0434,1.3697,0.7614,1.8498,1.0767,5.9501,1.4186,5.7198,1.7162,3.0532,4.1875,0.0868,0.6966,7.0334,2.8731,0.0005,0.011,0.1671,4.6886,0.0063,5.5386,2.6134,0.0899,1.3958,1.3313,4.1149,0.092,3.8504,7.7799,1.914,5.1602,0.6108,5.9738,1.1218,6.702,8.6178,0.7139,1.1608,0.6788,3.0417,1.2012,1.5627,1.6625,1.6859,0.0969,0.1269,1.6883,3.5511,2.1905,2.9521,4.2637,6.1008,3.8179,2.7233,7.4325,0.0058,1.562,3.4579,1.9702,2.3063,1.2034,5.412,4.9071,0.7367,2.0061,1.4556,5.3928,3.4215,1.0659,3.3006,5.7735,6.0863,3.3606,2.2366,3.4236,0.827,0.5974,0.0814,0.0682,1.5843,2.9509,2.5434,0.7738,1.242,2.6733,0.7973,2.163,5.4511,2.8201,1.1016,3.4919,0.1616,2.6149,0.6465,3.3032,0.6765,1.4033,1.626,1.0359,1.9742,0.1372,1.2068,1.392,4.1032,2.7528,3.1351,0.0055,2.985,1.314,0.4325,2.8698,2.9879,2.4453,2.8691,7.5433,3.2635,3.3624,1.192,3.5539,1.3093,5.1364,3.1234,1.0602,3.695,0.5543,0.4598,0.4363,1.443,1.7799,0.0357,1.3966,1.1568,2.3156,5.344,0.7224,1.7825,6.5601,3.1911,0.0153,4.0757,4.1653,0.5013,3.8485,3.8244,6.2534,8.2981,2.3789,0.0338,0.9624,1.5623,1.1633,2.8188,5.3681,0.7238,5.3209,4.1113,1.9647,3.6376,3.4585,2.2966,2.7228,1.6885,4.7645,1.1389,7.0463,1.9814,2.8273,1.2678,4.6308,4.1215,4.2714,3.0741,4.1903,2.8286,0.7523,3.2396,5.1581,0.0521,0.598,1.9523,0.4823,0.8623,1.0858,0.1653,0.0653,3.395,2.6132,6.1867,1.5305,2.5014,2.9731,0.7964,3.3846,1.0921,5.0492,2.3838,0.1758,3.1878,3.5665,0.9346,1.7145,1.3559,4.3308,4.5572,2.8434,0.1492,2.9881,2.4708,1.2567,0.2632,0.3609,2.2579,10.5879,1.1042,5.5204,3.0938,3.2639,2.9468,6.592,5.6929,2.9369,4.7427,2.1006,0.5788,0.1746,0.478,0.4557,0.9914,3.4621,3.2306,0.0963,1.7823,4.9417,2.3474,0.9335,3.0313,4.7823,5.0683,5.6589,0.0008,2.4752,4.7498,1.3365,1.1567,6.4789,1.7594,1.2506,1.8205,7.5729,6.6281,4.2075,2.8427,9.0207,4.0531,3.3782,0.3637,0.4262,0.101,2.995,5.495,4.6657,0.0928,9.6138,1.6084,6.2681,6.1176,2.7875,5.4324,1.8093,2.2652,7.3363,7.1636,4.8743,2.4861,2.325,3.1045,2.6045,2.8019,4.1836,3.8943,1.7097,1.8125,6.362,4.2635,3.2776,7.1609,0.845,5.2979,0.2045,3.1978,2.4973,5.4641,0.2029,3.9548,3.405,1.4583,5.6248,0.676,0.811,0.7066,3.0132,0.0538,7.0529,0.62,3.1401,3.3461,2.772,6.6544,3.7211,2.4831,5.3019,2.4129,2.007,1.0614,7.3772,1.3435,1.7931,3.0027,1.4363,1.4573,5.5942,0.7283,3.2199,1.241,1.5212,6.3502,1.02,0.5462,5.6162,2.6393,6.1326,4.3217,1.2591,6.8757,0.0253,1.7161,3.0758,3.8157,16.4733,7.6539,1.3796,3.5813,1.4635,0.4785,2.0308,0.9753,1.5159,6.8455,3.1707,3.0355,10.568,0.2717,0.515,3.5425,2.5131,0.8059,2.5842,5.0002,0.6537]}

The emirate said in a statement on Sunday that it hopes to promote the unity of the Gulf states based on the sharia, a conservative Islamic law which is a cornerstone of the Saudi monarchs s rule. \"We are asking the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) to follow the words of the Saudi monarchs in order to achieve the unity of the Gulf Arab countries based on the Shariah, the principles of democracy and the rule of law, \" the statement said. A statement issued earlier today by the three Arab countries and Kuwait said the Gulf leaders had called for the event to be postponed because of the worsening situation in Syria. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt said that they would consider calling off the meeting if a ceasefire to end a month long uprising for democracy failed to materialise. The statement called for the governments of Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain to stop supporting terrorism and extremist and violent groups operating within their countries. Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said on Sunday that the summit should take place, saying he hoped to \" take joint decisions to halt escalation of the crisis in Syria \". On Thursday Saudi officials said the kingdom s powerful Shiite opposition bloc would boycott the conference. The announcement came the day after two Saudi men were assassinated by gunmen in the eastern province of Qatif on Saturday. Saudi Arabia s Interior Ministry said at a press conference last week that the two men were \" assassinated due to their ties with some foreign extremist groups. \"","token_len":446,"entropy":[10.931,8.7529,9.0751,5.8523,3.3557,2.7624,3.4249,4.4086,3.9146,6.4433,1.9246,1.1431,2.9888,0.3114,0.0008,1.3793,10.2531,0.1525,3.7006,2.8794,0.6915,2.8661,6.8973,2.0766,0.6193,0.2499,0.5296,1.7862,8.0032,1.096,1.7309,0.024,4.3522,2.207,1.972,5.1598,8.4725,2.8983,4.1413,1.3382,3.5927,0.4626,1.8071,5.1057,0.5131,0.4563,0.9198,3.6264,0.0015,2.4202,5.3278,1.6489,0.1468,3.8506,11.1672,6.8614,2.1331,9.7441,4.1791,3.1287,4.4271,1.6758,1.3218,2.2406,1.2614,0.002,2.1399,2.5848,3.2516,5.6219,1.3374,8.4918,11.1399,1.2352,7.5324,0.0988,0.3769,1.1574,1.7284,6.4001,9.9801,1.8502,3.8969,3.4932,2.8497,5.1935,9.267,1.4225,2.707,5.1709,1.1473,2.1093,3.7491,8.6504,0.1438,3.32,0.613,8.569,0.005,0.2103,10.1811,4.2154,3.2634,1.1215,2.1024,2.2587,4.0301,3.042,0.5296,0.3383,4.8655,3.2666,0.1295,2.522,0.9402,7.5375,0.8759,1.3887,2.7965,0.4346,6.7823,0.0061,0.9896,6.6672,7.4774,2.3557,0.8013,6.4782,0.0285,0.0895,0.0013,1.6386,1.6494,2.3616,3.2267,1.7665,2.1779,4.7586,2.1345,2.334,0.095,0.0039,1.7652,2.1782,3.8298,0.0043,0.4801,2.9411,3.8417,0.4719,0.2094,2.5079,3.2572,0.3851,1.3211,6.4007,0.8478,5.728,2.3815,2.7874,0.1726,0.5197,2.0014,3.496,5.9175,0.0384,0.8597,8.5227,0.3387,2.882,2.7039,6.2208,2.1524,1.184,3.1294,2.2751,3.5463,2.5765,0.1007,0.928,4.3858,6.612,4.7767,4.2179,3.249,0.2735,1.9491,1.7928,1.986,5.2088,1.5403,5.1933,0.3057,0.9555,1.1117,2.5498,0.0246,0.9169,0.1018,0.2044,0.4803,5.3462,0.8661,7.9069,0.1509,0.8718,4.2483,2.6414,1.0464,3.1493,3.063,0.0664,3.2339,1.7438,1.2489,0.2899,0.3415,0.7736,7.1617,2.4258,2.4203,0.0227,0.646,7.3804,0.0344,1.7842,2.4381,4.601,0.2033,6.2556,0.6141,2.0117,1.8871,0.0065,0.0467,2.1965,2.313,1.0563,0.3305,0.1917,0.0754,3.873,3.1704,2.0218,5.0729,6.3234,0.399,0.8555,6.9487,1.7547,1.9322,4.1095,3.1636,1.6728,1.712,2.7354,3.6567,2.0991,3.705,0.712,1.2403,3.0976,0.1714,0.0962,0.284,2.0552,0.5986,0.419,4.2289,1.4557,0.2383,0.9176,0.9618,3.7053,0.2801,1.8992,1.6149,1.8278,0.018,0.001,0.5594,3.7068,3.4404,3.1791,0.9223,1.2641,4.4247,5.9692,3.6942,0.397,1.1287,1.6605,3.6092,3.8874,5.5429,2.8911,4.6814,5.5102,2.9619,4.9762,7.0941,4.7365,2.9388,0.7145,2.457,0.8564,0.3898,1.7944,3.5655,4.829,1.0005,1.1786,6.5583,0.249,3.5723,0.3589,1.2199,0.5423,2.1662,0.155,4.7752,1.6402,3.5766,0.7642,6.3341,6.479,3.0464,0.9361,4.7421,3.5066,0.5469,2.8347,0.4956,3.3927,2.6619,1.6954,0.3296,1.5248,1.1824,0.0479,2.4638,0.4308,0.0,0.5554,1.1777,0.1656,0.0043,0.6485,1.1768,1.4101,0.3407,1.1955,6.0866,3.4807,3.5469,0.0188,4.649,3.0742,2.9283,1.4292,2.1363,2.7626,7.719,7.1409,5.374,2.8304,6.2829,7.7006,0.8352,1.3272,2.5505,0.8648,0.1838,3.6523,4.9525,3.7458,3.6793,5.7676,1.0705,2.1636,3.587,6.4643,9.4503,6.2583,5.4661,4.5358,2.2719,5.4169,0.4697,4.2435,1.9548,1.7492,4.3067,0.8665,4.9059,1.059,0.1732,4.3911,2.4673,4.5075,0.5332,4.9421,1.9509,2.9476,0.9149,1.7311,3.7799,1.9514,0.008,1.8112,1.6233,0.0101,3.0938,2.3972,0.7675,3.2973,0.4406,5.3964,5.3197,0.8578,0.5461,4.3328,3.0145,1.1632,0.2631,4.8834,0.5739,0.1598,1.4362,1.9707,0.4344,0.8919,3.1674,8.2442,4.8909,0.0013,1.7822,3.999,1.8998,5.5899,4.4335,3.6953,0.4583,3.3224,1.2732]}

The bipartisan bill would impose sweeping sanctions on companies that do not respect human rights. The legislation would require U.S. investment review boards to give additional weight to human rights and environmental factors when considering deals, Reuters reports. The Senate and House plans to meet next week to move forward on the legislation. The bill will be unveiled to the public by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-Ariz., at the New York Times' Freedom at the World Forum. Read more on this story.\nIn an attempt to quell the mounting anxiety over its relationship with Huawei \u2014 a key part of its future-cloud strategy, and a U.S. ally \u2014 the Chinese government has stepped up efforts to convince U.S. companies to ditch the firm, raising concerns that this may have repercussions for Chinese firms more generally. The White House announced new restrictions on the sale of key U.S. technology to Huawei, which comes at the center of a U.S.-China arms race in high-tech. It is expected that more businesses will be hit by new restrictions, including Google, Microsoft and Cisco systems. In the past days, the United States has already imposed sanctions, aimed mainly at financial institutions, on U.S. tech firms whose business with Huawei is considered to be risky by the U.S. Treasury.\nWhile these new restrictions do not apply to Huawei itself, they will significantly complicate the sales of essential U.S. technology (such as chips and semiconductors). While there have been several other cases of government interference in the U.S. tech sector where U.S. government has sought to suppress other countries\u2019 tech companies, and many observers now expect a wider impact from this latest effort. After years of conflict with China in various fronts, including trade, technology and human rights, the American tech sector will be forced to choose whose side they want to be by a country that they fear more than any other.","token_len":446,"entropy":[11.9207,1.3415,0.2228,2.2405,3.2872,1.5309,2.8654,0.0009,0.006,0.0386,1.6681,2.6771,0.2992,0.9575,0.0019,3.4444,3.1953,3.994,6.0316,1.8808,0.0011,2.7272,1.1937,5.9838,0.0009,5.0957,0.0007,0.0046,0.0048,5.6578,4.5614,1.5871,6.1687,2.2068,1.9425,1.2012,3.3405,10.2686,2.7487,1.9879,0.0014,2.9472,0.1264,2.7794,5.4367,2.2274,1.2892,3.6211,6.1138,3.8107,0.3112,2.9296,0.6623,3.357,2.8542,7.3037,4.6944,0.0032,2.1213,2.3913,2.4123,0.8437,3.1384,2.9303,0.0003,0.0055,0.0529,4.465,11.0578,1.3174,0.2118,4.4825,6.4367,4.237,0.054,4.3377,0.0078,2.5105,2.7639,6.3574,2.6223,2.6219,4.5328,1.6874,3.5207,2.2245,0.0519,1.8312,3.784,3.5231,0.043,4.2634,0.2107,4.0746,2.1999,0.3659,0.8995,6.5377,0.6673,0.757,0.5385,1.2986,0.4879,2.1788,2.3745,3.2786,1.4427,4.3731,4.2824,0.5906,1.8617,3.441,2.2537,0.0046,2.6389,0.3973,1.3897,0.1953,0.001,0.0306,0.4097,2.1178,2.3295,0.0007,7.2688,0.0391,0.001,0.0383,0.0664,0.0006,13.1363,0.0004,0.3411,2.7457,1.3593,5.1619,0.7032,3.7203,3.3758,6.3063,9.8831,3.2199,5.6073,3.4142,1.9337,5.5086,1.1133,3.0955,2.7309,0.2445,1.3213,0.3758,13.5585,3.0955,3.9179,0.0161,4.2965,0.0905,1.8676,6.2511,5.244,1.8764,6.8954,6.0672,0.047,10.5058,6.1396,1.9925,5.1345,3.9229,0.0061,3.1128,5.9077,5.3567,9.0617,2.9815,3.3333,2.3452,1.7108,5.265,0.001,0.0036,0.1429,1.8197,1.9579,0.8275,3.1699,0.6351,1.4008,5.1817,0.2871,2.1754,0.0593,5.2638,2.3302,0.0004,0.0036,0.0305,1.2515,0.4652,7.4011,1.7623,4.2177,2.1537,5.9905,1.139,0.7915,5.0964,3.658,2.8367,4.6839,0.5566,3.4917,3.0351,7.6068,3.5007,0.2378,2.3811,4.7526,0.001,4.4101,6.2495,3.7311,0.6789,2.5327,1.9091,0.1137,7.0221,2.008,0.0004,0.0014,0.1116,2.1484,1.1559,1.7373,2.4433,2.3835,6.7688,2.4896,2.4735,5.3115,0.001,0.9148,3.0463,0.0006,0.0026,0.8874,0.4423,4.7549,1.3446,3.2214,5.3674,0.2362,0.1874,2.0873,4.1908,2.3485,3.1201,1.0512,4.1517,7.2498,0.6683,1.5275,4.2787,0.6127,4.1954,0.9185,1.6233,2.0993,5.4197,0.8785,2.4197,0.9989,3.4361,8.7474,0.9142,3.6604,2.3803,1.7643,6.9994,0.0764,1.7617,3.9141,0.0538,0.4073,5.7402,2.041,2.7635,4.3112,7.8853,5.3349,0.0197,7.1615,1.2474,1.5028,1.1231,4.1306,0.0004,0.0062,0.6982,2.3369,1.351,6.3134,2.8194,6.3288,0.4783,1.4185,4.6431,2.5865,0.2143,5.6341,4.6263,1.9379,1.5753,0.0005,0.0023,0.1272,4.7355,0.7984,1.5772,5.2429,4.2499,2.3147,1.3168,4.065,0.3011,3.3548,0.2561,1.2105,3.2933,0.1153,1.769,2.6265,5.0706,3.7628,1.2368,6.8639,0.3671,7.1736,1.7935,0.0005,0.0008,0.0479,1.417,6.0747,2.2879,0.0013,7.0629,1.3047,4.3258,0.0678,0.0008,3.2222,3.9666,3.6102,2.2043,0.079,3.0201,4.4394,3.5445,0.9673,4.5207,3.1834,0.547,1.957,2.8685,0.0004,0.0013,0.439,2.3697,1.473,5.6264,1.7338,0.0003,0.001,0.1137,3.8579,6.3183,3.7454,0.1769,5.8934,5.7908,3.3571,16.2732,7.0498,8.6639,0.7736,3.1222,3.7532,3.3504,6.4903,5.5716,3.0459,3.3001,5.8241,5.5363,2.6554,2.0139,3.2877,3.6895,0.6669,6.1252,2.8368,0.0297,7.0098,1.8857,0.5679,3.8498,5.1504,6.2789,0.2928,3.4885,3.6251,1.6199,3.7931,1.4094,4.088,0.023,0.4877,1.2128,5.5361,1.3342,1.3763,4.3868,1.7035,3.4296,0.0916,4.8693,10.6856,2.0845,2.4044,1.7159,0.0731,1.2464,6.9385,4.0657,6.2602,1.2643,4.7119,3.9473,5.2968,0.9507,1.7897,0.513,0.2625]}

Under a secret agreement, the agency has been allowed access to the documents after the government determined that further restrictions on the content would hamper its work.\nWhile the details of the CIA s role have been known since the Kennedy assassination, those of the political and intelligence workings between the CIA and its political allies within the administration had not been known, despite a series of secret agreements involving senior government officials and key intelligence officials.\nThe administration has also delayed the release of an intelligence report that it concluded was prepared by the CIA for its president and in which it said it was in fact responsible for the assassination, without telling the public why.\nThe CIA reports is the one piece of intelligence that has come out in the past year that raised suspicions that the agency was involved politically in the November 1963 assassination.\nThe CIA s response to the Trumps decision to release the files reflected the agency s concerns that Trump was acting without authorization and in ways that could potentially endanger its operation.\nTrump said he had instructed a senior CIA official s to coordinate the project and that the agency would hold off until further input was received.\n\"To have unfettered access like that, you know, just seems unfair,\" Trump said during his Friday appearance on Fox News from his resort property in West Palm Beach.","token_len":447,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.8114,1.8006,2.2914,0.535,5.5782,9.6189,0.0338,9.6602,0.1535,4.7313,1.9086,0.5137,1.2897,5.0274,0.0435,5.7652,1.6224,7.3432,0.037,8.9498,0.0496,6.0479,5.1585,1.0351,1.6139,9.2458,10.226,1.0408,0.3127,0.4379,0.2589,0.0035,0.0126,0.0001,0.4976,0.2839,14.9372,2.1313,1.3461,0.9224,4.649,1.4154,6.1815,1.2097,4.6499,0.7687,1.254,1.9394,0.0153,0.4519,1.2376,0.4878,3.1252,0.5835,2.0489,2.0221,4.3778,0.5554,7.7528,1.1961,0.5654,1.5697,5.2622,2.0509,0.9951,3.5487,0.3527,2.0838,2.1676,1.5271,4.8149,0.5409,0.115,1.5766,2.7884,0.0099,8.2562,2.7287,0.0268,0.8611,3.426,2.7048,0.0319,3.4933,2.0007,0.7313,0.7875,0.872,9.0187,2.4807,4.0462,4.0201,1.3917,0.719,0.0028,0.2701,4.2994,3.9503,1.3081,0.8552,3.8678,1.0174,1.1822,1.8969,2.1992,0.1696,1.5823,1.1063,2.2902,1.1288,2.3739,3.5019,6.9371,2.2387,2.1698,1.291,1.8643,0.0646,1.3456,0.3269,0.001,0.9941,7.7817,0.6589,0.4486,2.2167,0.6468,2.9763,0.7828,1.7183,4.1398,4.3263,2.1459,2.6679,0.0033,0.6895,4.923,0.0006,0.0014,0.0053,5.9898,4.4088,2.0221,1.1792,4.248,2.0746,2.2344,1.1808,1.8675,6.5769,2.8364,1.8836,3.7347,1.2318,0.1755,4.9834,1.5661,0.7854,2.7783,1.091,0.2465,1.2294,1.5907,1.948,5.6278,0.9434,0.0036,13.541,2.0558,5.0193,3.7539,1.1855,0.219,4.8716,1.3617,3.5044,1.5379,0.1362,0.9652,0.9753,1.472,6.4287,2.7634,3.7023,1.114,1.028,0.7528,3.4309,2.8287,1.8406,1.7061,2.4446,0.2592,0.847,2.6824,4.9717,2.1741,4.712,5.241,0.9838,8.1984,6.2568,1.257,1.2747,5.4737,2.137,5.3834,0.0001,1.3467,4.0811,0.4837,0.2297,5.2295,0.8794,5.1922,0.2904,0.2711,2.703,8.9682,3.9743,2.8522,1.5633,4.3508,2.1082,0.995,2.6483,0.1247,0.2483,4.8264,2.8794,0.6491,6.5279,1.6949,0.7876,8.6341,7.4505,1.4331,3.6771,0.0866,3.9856,3.7427,1.8429,6.3284,0.1643,3.2152,5.8841,2.4352,0.3534,1.9498,3.4314,6.5565,2.911,2.7646,0.0009,4.4346,2.3494,4.7657,4.5776,3.0486,0.1511,1.8791,4.5585,3.2869,0.9145,0.6347,0.1862,1.3737,5.2481,1.6859,2.8962,6.2853,1.657,0.3505,0.0426,5.0897,3.5536,0.7735,1.9694,4.4802,4.375,1.8003,6.7269,0.7692,0.9462,0.6561,3.468,3.7462,5.1411,2.4889,5.9609,1.4484,1.2692,2.6814,1.4468,2.1169,4.6691,3.9603,4.187,0.1166,0.6213,1.0402,2.5744,5.5977,3.7085,0.5858,1.1242,4.7208,0.953,0.3181,1.3388,2.0255,5.7872,7.7007,2.7267,4.9598,5.6682,0.1142,3.1699,0.924,2.226,3.7994,1.9183,1.8852,1.1827,1.91,1.5884,0.8197,6.8638,4.6177,1.4383,0.5023,1.5658,1.2631,1.5512,8.6413,1.685,0.4236,5.1897,0.1934,0.6012,0.921,0.7046,1.3201,1.6929,6.8869,6.3749,0.4714,0.573,4.9003,0.0032,0.8671,1.8074,1.9814,0.1854,0.7737,7.4919,1.4874,2.9665,5.864,4.1762,0.9343,6.3224,2.6274,4.0668,4.3978,4.1616,2.1415,3.4423,4.2492,0.191,2.2092,4.3017,3.1396,3.1356,5.9797,0.582,0.3084,3.0246,2.2777,2.1696,1.7558,4.3052,5.2391,1.5955,1.8238,0.1335,11.7771,2.2185,8.1452,2.0328,6.8785,2.5993,1.7783,1.3307,2.9376,1.545,5.2545,3.035,3.0893,3.3076,8.3602,1.488,1.0609,0.8493,0.4665,1.192,5.407,3.7951,9.8129,0.5868,0.0004,0.0234,6.8849,1.4711,1.4145,3.038,2.6405,0.1741,4.7949,5.3705,4.1804,0.949,0.4154,0.1762,2.9371,2.5448,4.7349,3.4211,0.7983,1.2357,0.1422,8.0725,1.5364,6.0043,6.85,0.262,4.2375,0.073,0.0004,1.3502]}

Speaking","text":"A formal U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel would cause catastrophe and lead to new conflict in the Middle East, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Monday. Speaking on the sidelines of a roundtable discussion in New Delhi, Bozdag expressed worries about escalation of the dispute, referring to the last time Ankara and Washington agreed on a joint statement. The statement came after a joint meeting of the ministers for foreign affairs from Turkey- which views Jerusalem as the capital of Israel \u2013 and the United States, where they agreed that there is no prospect of a comprehensive peace deal until Israel withdraws its occupation of the occupied Palestinian territories. \u201d We do not want to make any changes to the status quo. We do not want to create new issues in the Middle East. We have been trying to strengthen the cooperation of Washington with Ankara. Even now, despite the difficulties we encounter, we are still trying to maintain some cooperation with the United States. \u201d When asked about his comment in a separate interview, Bozdag said : \u201c We are not going to allow that the dispute over Jerusalem will be the next issue in the area. We hope we will be able to keep the peace in the region. In the last 20 years, there has been no peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians.

The threat made by a South Korean general who suggested the invasion of North Korea by U.S. soldiers in the early 2000\u2019s was more likely to cause the war, because that would have been seen as a challenge that posed a direct threat to Russia.\nThat was the conclusion drawn by the Russian military academy after a series of meetings with senior officials at the military attach\u00e9 in Korea. According to the study, the threat posed by North Korean missiles had become the worst that the United States could ever imagine.\nIn a study released by the Russian military academy, experts say that the main threat posed by North Korean missiles to other countries would be to Moscow. The report was published on the website of the US defense research facility known as the National Defense University (NDU) and it noted that the threat from North Korea could be seen as a direct attack on a city in the Caspian Sea.\nThe study said that the country could start a series of nuclear strikes against key sites in Russia on its way outbound from North Korea, including oil refineries and industrial sites. It could also hit critical ports, including the Strait of Hormuz and the Suez Canal.\nOn January 7th, the Russian Ministry of Defense had noted in a statement that North Korea had a total of 738 intercontinental ballistic missiles, all with a nuclear warhead and that most of them could take out any military target in the territory of other countries.\nAccording to the latest information acquired by researchers of the NDU, the North Korean military has now obtained the capability to deliver nuclear missiles to the US, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and France. And on January 7th, it deployed an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) of the Hwasong-19 type, with a range of about 13,800 kilometers. According to experts at the NDU, the missile was sent to the east of the Sea of Japan.","token_len":448,"entropy":[7.6235,1.3065,0.0036,2.8114,1.4421,2.2683,0.4673,4.1291,5.911,0.8912,4.3238,0.1839,4.4935,1.2834,0.8719,0.007,1.816,3.1958,4.3347,0.1616,3.4885,1.8625,2.2915,3.5837,2.0236,5.3867,0.3679,4.1626,9.6753,0.4074,2.2989,0.1997,1.8081,5.0298,0.6135,0.2643,0.7269,0.1302,0.1659,14.4186,5.5815,1.4608,2.7145,0.3696,3.8902,0.4597,1.5554,0.2287,4.2613,3.1153,0.96,5.0016,1.4627,2.0031,9.4282,1.3533,3.9405,2.4485,3.6695,6.321,3.2775,3.3778,5.9025,0.0191,5.9227,2.7079,6.3404,2.2643,6.2516,0.2212,1.1037,0.0269,3.1099,3.9003,0.0009,0.0027,0.0506,4.7014,2.5399,2.0406,3.7075,3.6804,16.7418,8.041,1.538,1.3049,5.3183,3.5057,0.5934,3.4155,2.7701,5.2534,2.478,4.354,4.3993,1.7711,1.8373,2.0365,4.3791,0.2149,1.0111,6.5269,4.3735,6.6424,1.3974,3.4147,0.1731,0.0933,5.0737,0.8912,0.3949,4.6904,2.1606,2.0125,4.5174,4.6649,0.5474,1.8676,4.4619,2.4571,8.5561,5.6208,1.6887,2.7093,0.0021,3.266,0.7904,2.5534,2.2227,2.3908,0.4127,3.2167,6.4126,0.138,2.3581,5.9209,1.238,4.4539,0.0014,1.2802,7.8849,0.3132,1.3088,4.3199,2.2533,0.2145,1.2732,2.4296,2.6664,3.1802,1.8553,3.1902,6.4713,4.463,1.7369,1.2996,0.008,3.3472,4.0357,2.4066,0.7771,0.4154,3.0983,2.0299,6.6248,2.7469,2.2554,0.3281,2.6219,1.8395,0.5575,1.2326,3.969,3.8745,0.7235,1.374,5.8538,2.1443,1.1564,0.1184,0.545,1.3231,0.5067,3.556,5.4082,0.6878,3.2556,0.2942,2.312,8.7667,1.2678,1.9975,4.1499,3.8037,2.4147,1.7512,2.5542,2.0922,0.1471,0.2405,4.982,4.4202,3.1264,6.1015,5.8884,0.0233,0.8274,3.3275,1.8129,0.6969,2.9085,0.4504,0.0062,1.6825,1.8863,3.3785,4.9815,0.1975,1.4371,2.1807,2.9746,0.6169,0.7173,3.4808,1.2837,3.5839,0.4495,0.7158,1.4008,3.9284,0.5326,3.5611,6.4994,1.9895,0.9368,6.975,0.1187,0.0003,0.0642,1.0073,0.4434,1.4093,2.7151,2.3203,0.3538,1.5152,5.6544,2.7729,6.3784,1.8148,3.7305,0.0027,3.386,2.8996,1.7663,6.5484,4.5171,0.9007,3.8893,5.0128,3.3995,2.3293,3.3035,11.7633,0.5055,1.6439,0.0142,1.4883,1.6781,6.5896,3.1089,0.0003,1.1924,3.9475,1.4658,0.8032,2.1036,5.808,0.5257,4.4148,4.8725,5.0521,2.1451,2.4153,1.3509,6.1811,0.0015,0.4865,0.0124,0.0,1.8556,0.8424,4.1116,0.5888,0.054,0.659,0.4253,4.3619,4.5497,3.4465,3.0928,0.2013,1.0983,2.7003,4.38,0.0019,0.5589,5.1598,6.9255,2.586,0.5711,1.4305,0.2235,2.3162,0.2423,1.0536,3.9836,5.4575,0.3165,3.9158,5.0187,4.771,0.0248,0.0099,0.0768,1.6011,4.6609,3.1531,1.5258,6.8395,1.789,0.0,3.0197,3.9286,5.613,0.2556,0.67,2.499,5.1707,2.7318,3.2226,3.6773,2.9848,0.913,0.6404,5.3908,0.6358,5.4113,0.4235,0.434,0.7925,3.1234,0.0036,0.4172,5.9744,3.8489,8.6237,0.2903,6.6172,4.2037,0.1789,2.7387,0.0004,0.4373,1.2314,2.3154,0.7144,2.8066,1.6459,5.1878,5.5847,2.9182,3.0723,0.086,4.4208,2.5234,3.2488,1.3233,2.1859,2.6063,2.1256,3.9019,0.5044,7.3818,0.3553,2.5938,0.5127,1.8131,3.1048,0.6976,5.6259,3.231,0.9836,3.2764,0.4217,0.25,2.9348,6.413,2.7717,1.163,0.0056,0.0254,0.0266,1.4416,0.0013,0.0011,0.1519,4.4795,2.1437,7.7941,0.0382,0.0001,0.0051,10.7982,3.0101,1.3317,3.4826,0.9125,0.3479,0.0746,2.5352,5.6724,0.3949,3.5646,0.5626,0.9718,4.3678,0.0025,4.4562,2.9091,0.2159,2.5505,0.0002,0.1671,0.8194,2.1442,2.1892,5.9013,1.4312,1.3589,5.9945,1.3697,0.9447,4.7868,0.0114,0.0024,1.8355]}

His spokesperson, Taita Albert Mutoya, told The Associated Press that Ahmed has no criminal record.\nKenya s constitution prohibits incitement of tribal hostility and discrimination by government officials. Tensions have intensified in some areas of a region straddling the equator, where many people consider themselves either northerners or southerners.\nKenya s president accuses opposition leaders of inciting violence that has left more than 300 people dead.\nBut as Kenya tries to cope with deadly violence that has left three hundred dead and nearly 60,000 displaced in three weeks, some analysts say the security crackdown has come too late. The ruling Jubilee Party says it stands by its calls for a boycott of the elections scheduled for October 18, the second to last in a six-year transition to democracy under Kenyatta.\nThe president has blamed the violence on politicians and the opposition is refusing to call off the boycott until reforms are enacted. This is the third election the country has hosted in less than a year under the pressure of opponents who have accused Kenya of rigging the ballot to favor Kenyatta.\nThe opposition has accused the president of rigging elections to favor him in a bid to stave off mass protests against rising food and energy costs. In recent weeks he has attacked leaders in the opposition while demanding that his supporters be given preferential treatment.","token_len":448,"entropy":[10.2022,8.8084,1.2164,10.943,12.5144,7.4438,7.0526,1.9672,6.3186,2.7393,2.6833,1.6098,0.0002,0.0024,0.002,0.0002,2.622,3.2763,0.4845,7.0637,7.6229,0.0261,0.6554,0.7955,0.1879,6.3154,0.0016,0.0004,3.6918,5.8246,1.5083,2.5305,2.2105,2.1814,6.9408,0.5598,2.8377,0.7518,0.0278,3.4571,3.1651,2.0758,0.4302,0.2915,16.1244,4.4538,0.0284,4.0448,0.7056,6.4527,0.1811,2.9616,5.9789,5.8428,6.4096,5.1331,0.5746,0.5711,1.7578,3.1783,2.9466,1.495,0.7584,1.7613,2.5445,4.5521,2.7798,3.8104,2.2495,2.61,4.5067,2.4214,2.1005,4.4366,5.9622,0.0863,0.2179,2.4605,2.1549,3.1805,6.2532,5.0688,0.9803,8.5871,8.2959,4.5657,0.2579,1.2417,6.5792,4.9833,8.3316,0.4917,1.8202,3.5298,0.2544,4.3857,5.9244,3.086,0.7455,2.109,8.4008,0.0617,1.2844,0.3214,8.95,6.8446,0.0139,0.0061,0.0213,0.0007,4.7822,1.8908,1.0454,0.9234,1.3516,0.741,1.8517,5.0671,2.6012,1.3262,4.3185,1.0285,0.0032,2.8621,2.7486,3.4374,4.0708,2.3155,3.4426,5.375,7.1502,1.5148,2.8919,1.9425,0.3687,2.8246,1.6997,9.9785,0.0011,1.9583,0.5159,1.9327,3.3525,3.1873,0.024,1.2105,1.6667,4.9162,0.6502,1.6049,1.9767,3.5038,1.8118,1.6933,1.7888,5.1401,3.0049,2.0432,2.1405,1.8636,0.0005,0.0006,0.1684,1.771,3.2071,1.9813,3.4318,0.0265,1.8102,2.0186,1.8951,2.409,6.289,5.0996,1.0048,1.556,4.9439,6.8704,1.8668,4.1898,5.7771,3.4391,9.2699,8.9071,7.3609,0.1243,2.4268,2.5681,0.4436,0.0004,0.4786,1.417,4.1304,3.7885,1.9344,0.1306,1.1848,0.4291,5.7569,0.2198,3.0049,4.627,2.4808,8.2602,0.0053,1.6938,10.8559,5.5252,2.0077,5.2544,3.4586,2.6543,0.3044,1.2071,5.0661,2.5015,1.4565,5.9827,1.6387,6.6279,1.873,1.7492,6.1907,3.4674,7.5308,0.108,0.0499,1.0474,5.8422,0.0123,1.6358,1.4735,3.6818,3.2266,3.7444,2.1752,6.2465,4.9682,0.008,0.0087,0.084,5.5765,0.0194,0.0003,0.5828,0.6301,3.4656,0.1027,1.9651,3.2102,7.9813,4.4193,2.0165,0.1296,1.8887,1.0707,5.7364,1.8634,2.6116,2.0146,0.0045,3.2469,0.5776,0.0936,1.9593,0.9777,4.6562,5.2822,3.8607,5.3322,0.0369,4.5996,0.0336,7.5899,1.3435,2.9689,0.6399,2.2978,5.5144,5.4013,0.6489,0.9585,3.635,4.7153,0.9263,0.0016,1.3774,2.3652,4.4254,1.9288,0.3264,4.034,2.8519,0.8831,1.2158,4.7288,5.4425,2.0862,5.2346,1.8697,0.0709,0.4755,3.115,5.4841,6.5188,0.018,0.4141,3.6796,0.8758,6.7895,0.9893,0.5871,4.5018,0.3678,1.9439,4.5628,0.2248,0.8903,3.2134,2.8783,0.1245,3.4366,3.7937,1.5868,3.1443,4.9703,5.5699,4.4012,5.1143,2.102,6.2826,0.0594,0.8805,8.7828,2.4328,0.4549,5.5184,0.8296,0.032,0.0333,0.4441,0.5385,2.1497,3.8322,1.7938,4.4302,1.0726,1.8206,0.2645,6.6118,1.7101,2.6444,1.8625,9.3463,5.7973,0.0354,4.9634,2.2691,0.6943,4.1372,3.2506,7.2312,0.5228,3.8988,0.6601,6.7345,2.489,1.9486,2.1152,5.2467,3.8069,3.9352,0.2969,5.0527,1.4299,1.5775,0.0015,0.8876,0.2801,4.1484,1.0683,7.3841,0.552,7.3008,2.1503,1.7375,2.618,4.5923,0.7845,6.7317,0.8068,4.6311,4.3626,4.4019,2.1491,0.0058,0.1671,0.6184,0.6301,1.9522,2.6633,1.4861,2.5787,0.9394,1.6459,0.2348,5.9238,2.6726,1.5459,1.5639,2.9083,3.4321,1.739,1.1554,0.0104,4.272,1.8002,0.0024,5.6157,1.2225,2.7823,7.5713,4.6799,3.3093,3.2157,1.3644,0.5695,4.1316,3.0153,0.7843,6.1548,0.2153,4.8351,6.1903,2.7808,0.8645,1.4503,6.5392,3.8197,1.5239,3.094,4.0769,1.8232,2.6378,5.5234,0.2041,1.0636]}

Business executives","text":"The Trump administration drew vigorous responses to its announcement on Tuesday it would be ending an Obama-era program that allows children to stay in the United States who entered the country illegally. Business executives said the news would be bad for the economy and could create new problems for already tense immigration relations with Mexico, while the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called it an insult and attack on American public schools.\nPresident Donald Trump is set to cancel the DACA program in two days, and that has set off a torrent of angry reactions in the immigration community and from Republicans across the country.\n\"This decision not only will negatively impact millions of young people who have participated in Dreamers, but has the potential to do even more harm in the way it undermines confidence, trust and support for our immigration reform efforts,\u201d said Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ). \u201cIt will send a signal that if you come to the United States illegally and don't speak English, they don't trust you.\u201d\nThe congressional Republican leader also blasted Trump, saying on Twitter: \u201cThis is an insult to all of us -- and will fail to address our core mission of ensuring those who have been here illegally for 20 years or more are naturalized \u2014 and that immigrants do not threaten and don't steal jobs from American workers.\u201d\nDemocrats have criticized Trump as well, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who tweeted \u201cTrump is a liar and a coward and a danger to our country.\u201d\nPresident Trump made the announcement Tuesday evening, but he was given no choice: He needs Congress to vote on his immigration plan.\nThe announcement came after months of political wrangling about whether this action was necessary and whether it would help create jobs for the American workforce, or provide amnesty to illegals.\nIt seems like the government has already made some of that illegal immigration, but I didn\u2019t catch that on TV.\nThere\u2019s a lot of people who do not want to work because they don\u2019t believe they can receive a fair paying income, or because they fear they won\u2019t get another job, but they will be punished for being illegal.","token_len":448,"entropy":[7.6977,0.9163,8.7984,9.303,6.2327,1.0533,2.5878,5.432,2.2789,2.0766,7.5119,0.7192,4.1639,4.8482,3.5263,2.0506,0.3853,0.0138,1.9973,0.8395,2.9387,4.2464,1.3348,2.3307,0.5668,0.9753,1.2801,0.0021,7.1671,5.6706,1.5453,1.3724,0.7958,1.6692,9.8009,3.283,2.5357,1.0712,6.2931,2.3397,2.4375,4.1157,0.8241,1.8504,1.6247,0.8053,3.4248,4.5653,4.6083,2.405,0.6584,7.7223,8.2677,4.8817,0.9276,3.3551,1.0525,2.1405,6.3434,2.9917,5.9398,0.0011,0.4709,2.3337,0.0003,0.0389,0.058,2.7507,0.0065,0.0002,3.0994,1.2293,2.2994,3.7174,4.047,8.0689,0.4016,2.66,6.3257,4.4614,0.3234,0.3632,22.6514,1.2093,0.0121,3.6182,3.0933,0.018,6.1261,1.1867,2.2704,0.111,2.7952,4.0428,2.2091,0.8627,2.9457,5.5612,3.8984,4.5332,0.5518,1.0326,4.9195,0.0072,3.3716,3.1774,2.9025,0.6676,3.5854,0.6648,3.2676,4.531,3.3931,3.823,0.0382,1.0118,0.4509,0.7628,9.3705,1.8538,3.387,5.7178,0.1951,4.4435,4.179,0.5053,4.3994,0.1137,2.4121,0.7756,1.6285,1.5749,7.2836,0.118,7.7929,0.5213,1.1802,0.6092,4.2572,2.8945,0.347,0.0291,5.1091,4.405,0.1332,0.6078,4.0219,0.7358,5.8613,2.8318,5.0733,6.9138,4.1226,3.9977,0.5532,4.4474,0.6472,1.0059,3.5008,5.8292,1.624,3.7016,15.7967,7.9052,3.8337,2.6105,0.0009,3.9816,2.4058,1.1251,0.0801,0.0698,2.0216,0.9143,4.8334,4.7164,5.4659,1.1537,4.3306,0.4015,3.4361,1.1749,4.0614,1.3553,5.4381,1.0512,1.384,0.4348,0.0008,0.4547,1.7189,3.5375,0.0004,4.1045,0.4278,0.412,5.4176,2.4015,0.0013,3.7621,0.0615,2.0427,3.7075,2.6805,3.2375,2.1685,7.915,4.0813,2.5153,2.9389,3.6512,1.9116,3.5959,0.8957,4.5073,0.8262,1.378,4.0461,2.2615,2.5348,0.8945,2.8265,0.8394,0.2906,2.6034,1.541,1.1678,7.1475,1.922,4.4593,6.8342,1.691,3.5169,2.0938,3.6725,4.6871,0.8339,3.5192,6.221,1.126,1.9821,1.8467,0.7775,2.2196,1.3998,3.9407,0.1408,3.3004,0.5214,1.3698,9.3238,0.2471,7.3406,1.1661,2.7798,6.0117,5.2719,0.1189,7.8741,6.0074,5.9538,0.0017,6.3829,3.741,2.051,1.4747,0.8016,0.7664,0.6853,0.8856,0.6164,4.6103,2.3582,3.4068,1.3126,4.7662,4.1515,0.7341,4.0735,2.3361,0.0016,2.0159,0.0022,0.4834,0.0484,0.016,0.2584,0.8062,0.7442,3.3182,9.8139,1.1561,3.6287,1.6852,1.906,2.3351,1.3193,1.2114,4.3915,2.6002,1.8198,4.4724,0.0728,1.1022,0.6566,0.7608,1.5446,0.9907,0.464,4.2775,1.2147,4.7751,1.4451,0.7856,2.6558,3.0996,1.4449,2.4901,2.6571,2.9092,5.576,1.5831,4.0423,4.2947,2.0368,5.2065,3.8927,0.1315,4.1263,0.8894,1.3579,3.424,1.1526,0.983,1.3765,2.0059,3.0067,1.9018,1.8531,3.9612,0.0191,5.3474,1.874,0.0018,3.7482,1.9529,6.268,4.0869,1.8862,1.7491,2.1865,3.1488,0.7637,0.8184,3.1075,4.4739,0.6804,2.797,2.3494,2.197,2.5805,1.8459,2.5077,5.1376,5.1693,1.1647,4.222,0.0012,0.9226,0.9307,4.4993,5.6029,3.0722,1.685,4.6414,1.7891,3.5312,3.2557,2.5993,3.4732,4.0321,7.962,2.1063,4.5827,1.5049,5.0443,5.6824,10.9103,8.2602,0.7235,7.0483,2.87,4.0376,2.8868,0.7853,2.2316,4.2423,5.6177,1.3303,0.5668,1.5319,2.0406,0.4213,4.0809,1.0179,4.332,1.0967,1.7093,0.3737,2.9285,4.0941,0.825,1.8504,0.4256,0.4996,0.3285,3.452,2.629,2.0577,7.1217,1.4494,1.9421,6.653,7.8201,1.9677,2.1647,2.6913,0.3083,4.403,1.86,3.0996,0.6478,0.1881,2.0247,1.2874,6.6216,1.0914,2.342,2.3534,2.1153,3.971,2.2889,5.3295,1.5742,3.1416,2.3164,0.987]}

The killing of the Iranian fighters comes as it has become increasingly apparent the Trump administration and Congress have decided to stop the United States from withdrawing troops from Syria, a country that was destroyed by a war waged by Washington.\nThe Trump administration also signaled Thursday that it would allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons, despite an administration shutdown that is expected to last until the new year after the Senate failed to get a bill passed, which would authorize the president s actions.\nThe government shutdowns began with the House refusing to let Republicans on the committee overseeing the Iran deal sit down to debate, and the Senate refusing to let Democrats take control of the committee without votes from Republicans.\nThe situation would become worse if Iran and Washington do not strike an agreement by Nov 11 for the lifting of a US sanctions threat imposed on three years ago.\nAt an emergency meeting of his top economic advisers and financial ministers on Monday, Finance Minister Nouriel Rouhani said the US move should help remove the Iranian regime from the world economic map. They urged the US to do the same, Rouhani said.\nHe added that on that path, Iran would not follow an American path to dishonor the nations that have stood by the Islamic republic.\nThe statement came two days before the first day of the US Thanksgiving holiday, which ends on Wednesday.\nThe decision by the Trump administration to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital will bring down the US in terms of international standing and legitimacy, Tehran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told a gathering of military commanders on Monday.\nThe statement came to contrast to United Nations Security Council s resolution 2334, which was passed on Dec 2 and declared the United States recognition of Jerusalem s status as Israel s capital a breach of the consensus on Jerusalem s status in the United Nations. Israel is part of the United Nations and its capital should be Jerusalem, the resolution stated.","token_len":448,"entropy":[5.8371,9.3787,12.2122,0.9052,7.2436,0.4157,1.0797,8.4483,0.287,3.5855,7.3436,0.0021,1.0284,5.2873,2.8542,4.5705,2.1964,6.6821,2.2822,8.1121,1.3873,1.2755,2.4367,2.0044,1.7021,3.4066,3.805,3.8559,8.8512,0.3145,1.0572,10.7642,0.0301,6.5505,4.4969,6.9942,0.5181,1.1924,3.1619,2.0026,3.3095,0.0166,2.9137,4.3639,1.5291,1.3336,0.8717,0.7376,12.7649,4.456,1.2165,1.5862,4.7851,3.3419,3.3439,3.9481,5.2033,3.6621,1.8784,0.6044,0.5999,1.4375,4.5441,7.199,4.3483,2.2961,0.8638,7.2884,1.6553,2.3259,4.41,1.5803,1.6048,3.3683,5.5928,1.644,1.6583,5.9552,2.7136,4.1336,1.3418,2.0276,3.0024,4.6794,0.0676,4.1764,4.6021,1.0837,3.7608,0.4797,4.9458,2.0078,4.3376,0.0719,0.2213,3.9301,2.444,0.1303,2.7154,1.8635,2.2266,3.9697,1.6505,3.8785,6.1509,0.518,2.1272,3.0943,5.3893,0.3355,4.8818,2.2851,0.2857,1.5469,3.8096,0.0548,3.5984,4.9813,5.3756,0.5843,0.2118,1.0616,4.6866,3.0078,0.2822,3.4305,1.1366,0.2921,1.433,3.8724,3.8381,4.5244,7.7566,2.017,4.2706,1.5692,0.1061,1.3879,1.5495,2.233,4.7848,0.3994,5.3417,1.5416,5.449,4.8442,0.0603,4.626,1.0217,3.1416,1.3976,3.4825,2.5159,1.2729,4.7734,1.0216,3.6232,10.6428,4.7266,0.4807,0.2502,1.601,6.2495,2.508,5.0848,3.7636,3.7334,1.7115,4.7808,6.9546,0.0678,6.0581,3.4507,5.4487,0.3193,3.0694,8.0199,0.4556,2.4651,1.9501,5.2242,4.9792,2.2319,2.3503,4.9442,1.7942,2.4169,1.1247,4.6798,0.0812,3.4109,3.3919,3.81,4.1399,0.2098,0.2982,2.5526,5.8114,6.4178,1.9772,2.7019,0.3652,0.5081,1.5953,5.3338,5.8375,3.3831,3.1615,0.8226,2.9558,3.6306,4.1151,4.2741,0.1487,5.5455,2.8292,0.1828,2.6667,6.8871,8.6665,5.0037,1.7544,1.0722,0.0068,2.484,2.3689,2.1731,8.5198,3.6996,1.0695,6.6583,6.9986,0.5343,0.9685,0.7244,5.337,4.3145,2.2709,0.2483,0.5485,4.5084,3.8042,3.7499,0.8067,3.3405,6.8313,4.8289,1.6958,2.6888,0.1925,5.8513,0.4621,5.2252,0.8353,0.992,15.3624,0.9164,1.3797,2.1623,7.0354,4.7958,4.1743,6.5316,1.3008,3.1109,2.1749,0.3317,1.388,4.2983,3.0239,2.0671,0.95,7.5443,4.1606,1.4571,1.5852,0.3798,4.1175,2.1764,0.2099,1.7292,8.1271,0.3682,0.7043,0.1932,3.6555,2.5438,0.3742,6.214,4.3466,8.0816,1.182,1.7459,1.0921,2.1017,5.6558,4.4744,3.1731,3.4296,3.3946,13.1573,0.51,1.5774,7.6928,2.1375,2.0329,3.6836,1.4881,1.8452,4.0476,3.2747,0.8478,0.3099,2.1649,4.9499,1.3793,4.0036,0.2173,2.2805,1.379,3.5338,4.0272,0.0267,1.4299,2.2976,6.4573,0.4603,0.8089,1.9445,4.0764,0.9397,3.3624,0.3494,0.6679,1.8924,5.2985,1.7712,1.0381,2.522,0.0513,0.424,5.1236,0.0905,0.1315,0.2033,2.0462,0.0167,2.65,6.9463,5.3012,0.83,2.5738,5.3351,4.5529,0.0184,4.7165,5.3609,1.5468,7.4415,0.7037,3.8261,8.8855,6.7169,0.0095,0.3197,0.0001,0.0,0.0368,0.0005,0.0,2.6627,2.0263,3.265,0.2815,4.7468,2.0239,2.2925,1.4334,0.4395,0.2368,1.9819,2.7757,1.4632,6.283,5.595,3.3369,6.8166,0.6278,1.326,0.0015,8.9593,2.6336,5.3969,0.1064,0.8653,0.2257,2.623,1.6477,2.3358,2.9809,5.7974,2.5897,4.8703,1.5225,3.0596,0.0819,7.1559,0.2107,0.1535,5.9646,5.3049,1.4963,0.3807,0.2784,0.0139,5.2538,6.535,0.0964,1.4751,7.7971,2.6133,3.9896,2.8871,1.1219,4.0561,0.9187,2.0902,0.0694,0.8723,6.7263,3.0316,4.7866,0.0027,0.439,1.9612,0.2835,1.6322,3.0474,3.7019,5.9691,0.6932,4.0589,2.2878,2.5582,1.8074,2.4024,0.1336]}

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional leaders agreed on Wednesday to pass an extension of the debt limit until Dec. 15 , as well as a government funding bill covering the same period and disaster","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional leaders agreed on Wednesday to pass an extension of the debt limit until Dec. 15, as well as a government funding bill covering the same period and disaster relief and transportation spending. The new debt deadline was set in response to the government failing to raise the federal borrowing limit on Dec. 14.\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), cosponsor of the government funding bill, said the Senate would pass the $US1.35 trillion bills on Wednesday.\nThe agreement came after Trump refused to sign the government funding bill because he disagreed with the process by which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) reached it.\nUnder a process called reconciliation, Republicans and Democrats could pass the bill under their own rules without the President's signature. Under that process, only those who cosponsored the bill and signed it with their names would have official signatures on the bill.\n\"We have agreed today on a bill that will be passed, will be signed,\" Trump said.\nThe agreement is needed as the United States faces an imminent deficit crisis and is set to default on federal debt on Sunday.\nIt is unclear whether Trump will sign the extension due to the lack of a final agreement and whether he will raise additional concerns about the process and demands to be fully involved.\nAt the end of the debt limit debate, Trump said Democrats, who controlled the Government Finance Committee, should have reached a bipartisan agreement that went beyond his red lines.\n\"If they could have done that as we were reaching out to each other on the debt, it would have been fine,\" Trump said.\nThe government funding bill contains provisions to fund schools through the end of the 2021-22 school year.\nTrump has promised to sign the bill, the same language as he signed an individual funding package earlier today covering disaster relief funding and transportation spending through Dec. 15.\nWithout the two bills it appears US money runs out on Sunday, which has led the US Treasury to file for a bond default.\nPresident Donald Trump says he did not mean for the United States to be defaulting on its federal bonds amid ongoing talks for a massive U.S. debt reduction plan.","token_len":449,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,2.6246,5.5167,1.3996,4.8289,1.4117,2.1268,0.245,5.424,3.2366,4.9425,0.3633,0.6926,4.1218,1.6644,2.6822,4.3235,0.0018,2.2311,1.1589,4.5148,3.4167,0.0104,1.6986,6.0759,3.26,0.9846,6.6649,1.3657,6.1522,1.1885,4.5767,9.646,0.4807,2.7792,5.8279,2.0857,0.7664,2.8194,4.2979,2.1596,7.4555,2.6236,1.3392,3.5673,5.7168,0.003,1.6579,4.0748,5.8628,0.0432,3.6618,1.2813,2.3763,2.9667,0.1162,2.944,3.0092,0.0026,3.2808,0.9299,0.5223,22.1914,0.0444,4.646,0.0526,0.0,1.1686,0.0528,0.0444,0.0026,0.0555,3.9467,0.7587,10.9412,0.0682,0.879,0.0446,0.1174,5.3129,0.549,0.0904,0.1468,0.5833,1.2377,3.6531,2.3408,2.3516,0.5447,4.8567,9.5746,2.6316,0.0699,5.0628,0.2602,7.6919,2.8705,1.8696,0.8321,0.531,7.9923,4.3253,2.9974,1.1001,2.3894,5.8135,0.173,2.1317,1.5194,2.9312,0.4666,0.0716,4.2486,1.2979,5.0708,0.0469,1.1641,5.832,4.0272,0.0105,5.1181,2.6196,0.0145,0.02,0.0005,0.4133,0.001,0.0042,3.0583,0.0926,5.1733,4.8533,0.396,0.5876,6.0624,3.1718,4.8618,1.9992,0.5411,0.1384,3.2936,3.3331,0.122,2.5812,3.7547,2.275,3.4012,5.6637,4.3064,0.6747,2.4236,2.3788,2.0151,5.064,0.2988,0.5573,0.4345,5.016,2.8868,0.4452,0.0425,3.9954,3.8823,2.2702,9.3169,0.0035,0.2355,0.508,1.6442,3.1732,3.1035,0.7904,4.1576,1.9485,4.4406,4.2397,2.9242,7.993,7.1772,1.3939,1.1261,1.045,0.3008,0.2746,1.8329,1.982,2.5849,2.8869,5.0557,2.071,0.841,4.1249,0.5424,0.9476,3.1885,3.2374,3.1208,4.5277,1.0724,1.4978,5.6295,1.8923,0.2506,1.5659,0.7968,1.631,2.427,3.0229,5.9673,3.3465,1.6008,4.1637,0.0289,2.145,2.4686,4.0482,6.4077,3.8611,1.2181,2.7593,3.5798,0.0594,6.271,0.4881,4.8424,0.7889,3.4859,5.6877,0.4864,0.6095,5.2806,1.8488,2.802,1.4174,1.6195,1.0357,0.7128,0.2945,5.2607,6.4358,0.122,1.5255,4.0026,0.0009,2.058,4.4108,1.428,4.2357,1.9712,1.2275,0.4833,5.9261,5.7165,9.0399,0.8673,0.6956,3.4185,3.028,6.4485,2.9778,3.1672,5.6955,5.1773,1.5051,0.347,5.254,1.0273,3.0449,0.0051,0.7313,5.8969,0.786,1.6001,0.3953,1.554,1.5338,5.7256,4.5618,1.9868,5.6456,0.9988,8.6552,2.1811,0.0843,0.5852,1.916,2.9512,5.5056,0.7116,5.1945,0.4465,3.3376,6.4383,2.0777,3.6267,8.1293,2.1415,0.7216,0.2753,0.4968,2.8352,1.5799,4.4433,1.456,2.5828,1.0641,6.2568,3.6102,2.7646,6.145,2.7598,0.5456,4.7398,0.1352,3.3794,1.9485,0.7787,3.1264,2.7546,0.4375,0.1391,0.4465,5.606,0.6778,0.5352,0.1171,0.3212,0.6179,1.9786,3.6274,1.7668,0.1218,4.4689,2.9814,1.3501,3.4831,6.4756,4.2906,2.3218,0.5783,0.0053,1.13,8.1717,0.7983,0.5044,0.1757,0.0085,0.8483,1.3258,2.4743,2.2119,3.3224,0.3525,4.7189,0.4582,1.2998,2.3492,5.1624,2.839,5.9478,2.2442,2.4208,1.6416,3.4795,5.8945,3.8584,4.2673,2.5226,5.6287,10.2139,5.3513,0.3238,4.9555,1.4078,0.7402,1.112,5.6275,1.2344,0.0018,0.6698,0.2531,0.503,6.7225,1.1279,4.8748,2.2836,6.3822,5.0096,8.8061,7.7364,7.4695,0.0634,2.0512,2.8348,1.4271,3.7504,4.0631,2.6241,3.9744,3.8329,1.7762,1.2694,6.0159,1.6954,2.0045,5.6133,1.2408,1.1118,0.7823,3.9786,1.7497,0.009,5.06,1.165,6.0342,0.1735,5.0685,4.7198,1.0309,3.0394,0.0028,0.212,3.4153,3.4653,0.1495,0.1307,0.913,4.4987,7.4008,7.3914,3.8489,5.4065,4.9693,1.0512,4.4459,3.8808,0.0059,0.0022,0.0698,1.0546,2.871,2.9873,0.4373]}
{"prompt":"President Donald Trump , in a first exercise of his power to commute criminal sentences , cut short the 27-year prison term of a kosher meatpacking executive who was convicted eight years ago of bank","text":"President Donald Trump, in a first exercise of his power to commute criminal sentences, cut short the 27-year prison term of a kosher meatpacking executive who was convicted eight years ago of bank fraud, tax evasion and insider trading.\nHis announcement came Friday on the same day Israel announced it was preparing to open the investigation into how it facilitated the sale of illegal land to Palestinians.\nUnder Trump, a judge is normally made to choose whether to commute the prison term but the president has the power to waive that requirement, making his announcement a first.\nJared Kushner was convicted alongside his brother-in-law, business manager and real estate mogul Robert M. Cohen, of aiding Trump in his realty business by luring wealthy clients into a scheme to shell out false money to get him to build a luxury resort on the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Miami Beach. The duo also were convicted of tax evasion and insider trading, the U.S. Justice Department said Friday.\nCohen, 45, said that Trump asked him to help keep Kushner \u2014 his longtime fianc\u00e9e\u2019s stepbrother \u2014 out of prison.\n\u201cI had absolutely no idea what we were doing. We were under pressure from Trump, and we said, \u2018You don\u2019t want me to do this, but we will do it \u2026 And we would do so, because of our relationship with him, and our love for his family,\u201d Cohen told The Associated Press in a video telephone interview.\nCohen said Trump later asked him to pay thousands of dollars to his personal lawyer to persuade a New York court to commute the sentence or a defiant Kushner would get custody of his children because he couldn\u2019t afford to pay for child care.\nHe said he eventually agreed to do that because he was afraid the case would drag on and damage Cohen\u2019s business dealings with Trump.\nKushner, the former New York mayor of Trump Tower, was sentenced twice in 2006 to 12 years in prison before a United States District Court judge sentenced him to 54 months, with 18 months suspended and he and Cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion.

the deals underscored the close relationship between the two countries.\nMacron said that the contracts should help bring in investment and create jobs.\nPresident Macron said that both parties agreed to the construction of a new nuclear plant in Iran and that French firms had agreed to work in Qatar.\n\u201d They agreed on another joint venture on the construction of a nuclear power plant in Iran, \u201d Macron said.\nMacron, speaking at the Doha International Financial Centre after his state visit to Qatar, went on to describe Qatar as a \u201c stable \u201d and \u201c resilient \u201d country, adding that there was \u201c no reason to be concerned about the Qatari banking system. \u201d\nMacron said that both countries agreed that the new nuclear power plant in Iran was a \u201c positive signal \u201d for the Middle East.\nQatar is in talks with France and Germany to build the plant near the city of Isfahan in Iran, with the first nuclear reactor to begin operations by 2025.\nThis may be one step leading to Iran giving up its enrichment goal, which under the current deal would make Tehran capable of producing enough material to make only a few bombs.\nThe new agreement, negotiated by Macron, European Union ( EU ) foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and Iran\u2019s UN ambassador Mohammad Javad Zarif, was drafted over two years and contains a provision for enhanced surveillance, and a pledge to keep international pressure on Tehran at a high level.\nMacron said the deal \u201c sets the stage for us returning to the JCPOA, \u201d referring to the 2014 nuclear deal reached between Iran and major powers including the US, Russia, China, UK, France, Germany, Spain, and the EU.\nOn Thursday, the European Union approved the accord, saying it represented a \u201c substantial move forward \u201d towards a \u201c better deal. \u201d\nA European Union official said that the agreement also represents more than 20 years of diplomatic engagement, and is a result of close cooperation between Iran and European and international partners.","token_len":449,"entropy":[3.288,5.4658,6.1955,9.1208,4.8243,2.3071,3.8994,6.8,0.5052,2.8416,2.5849,7.384,5.2173,1.0212,6.7119,0.0408,0.5861,3.2834,2.7792,1.2371,6.9084,2.7412,1.5217,0.0001,0.2754,2.0343,2.0669,0.3393,1.284,4.6158,8.2283,0.0012,0.6368,6.1196,1.7785,0.2368,0.8551,0.4414,0.3104,0.3322,0.3826,20.7531,0.0004,1.3948,1.5131,1.4159,5.0364,4.5003,2.7557,4.1106,4.1895,3.6645,1.8338,3.5164,0.1445,1.3562,0.3725,5.9985,2.0409,1.7955,0.9682,5.66,5.1203,2.7052,0.8369,2.6923,5.7855,0.2479,1.5298,1.1566,6.4613,2.0236,0.8813,5.8539,2.1388,1.8126,5.0903,3.4815,2.6729,2.4495,0.0901,3.047,3.5113,3.6508,1.2602,0.3305,11.7392,8.4952,8.1875,1.9988,2.868,6.9446,4.4933,1.2517,4.0869,1.8768,2.9617,0.0906,0.6341,2.2934,1.3388,0.3108,0.4774,2.5449,1.4098,9.2012,1.4005,1.6539,0.2404,0.5341,0.4386,3.6321,0.0006,4.0018,2.6377,1.3176,0.957,5.3038,0.2793,3.1223,6.2982,3.0505,4.6334,2.605,5.9205,0.0784,1.4834,1.6728,0.1805,6.784,0.2618,0.0327,4.0355,3.1102,0.4737,0.6878,16.7577,4.2288,7.3064,3.513,2.8779,3.8563,3.736,1.0267,6.3601,1.0325,0.2157,1.8535,2.1835,2.1369,0.1059,4.1907,0.7391,6.6347,0.471,1.5902,3.8575,0.9465,2.8797,2.7505,0.5674,1.3772,6.6401,0.0052,8.5185,1.0199,0.7391,5.2839,0.446,0.5797,3.0827,0.0006,1.1605,0.3328,4.1394,0.913,1.6973,2.006,1.4127,3.8791,2.1764,1.9446,0.2542,1.3728,0.7346,1.7194,1.6905,1.986,0.4847,4.4475,7.8189,1.8676,0.3925,2.5418,0.7172,4.0008,0.0103,1.2114,0.4358,4.7146,0.0293,2.3449,4.2939,2.5317,0.3502,2.1694,1.4963,2.5678,1.0319,1.244,2.2509,3.01,5.9696,0.7397,3.8441,0.0153,5.5045,0.1076,0.0002,2.0325,3.1594,1.1757,4.3072,1.2175,4.283,4.8323,1.882,2.645,3.7189,2.2367,3.0222,3.4917,0.662,0.6046,5.419,6.0639,1.2966,3.2754,4.9862,9.5662,0.2606,3.9585,7.4651,0.2189,0.6818,6.4946,8.7312,1.8436,1.7744,6.6581,1.7735,2.9271,2.7715,2.2113,4.9884,3.7376,4.3512,0.0236,0.6351,1.8736,6.2294,0.4985,2.6386,7.2687,2.1228,2.4987,3.3405,1.268,0.4889,2.2467,3.0511,2.8431,2.9824,6.0668,1.0533,2.5732,1.5852,6.0614,1.1334,3.4166,7.3451,0.2619,4.6637,0.7555,0.0359,8.3219,5.738,8.0323,2.8711,4.266,4.589,12.0683,7.1473,4.5418,6.5634,2.5986,2.6326,1.2212,0.0011,0.005,0.0006,0.3569,2.7143,5.7128,4.5615,2.4894,0.8682,4.312,5.8151,1.8892,3.8766,1.6566,6.8089,5.9304,2.5746,3.8127,2.5845,5.5799,0.4436,4.8077,5.6232,3.7255,0.0549,1.0967,6.3792,2.1873,3.95,0.0381,0.3293,0.271,3.4691,0.001,0.9962,2.5928,1.8396,6.8733,1.9689,6.2605,1.9154,0.5869,0.0399,8.3279,7.9324,0.1289,1.0024,8.6715,0.0394,0.0019,2.395,2.5259,1.513,6.358,0.0312,0.4157,6.7347,2.4553,0.3408,3.7624,1.1244,0.7802,0.047,8.1607,0.0953,3.0109,0.6468,1.3851,0.7246,1.7912,0.6341,0.2394,0.7992,4.9496,0.8043,0.2554,0.834,0.8026,0.7766,4.5384,0.655,1.2281,1.0451,2.4603,0.6368,0.3121,4.8269,1.9577,0.1648,1.4398,2.4542,1.0394,4.8938,1.0992,4.8817,1.1299,4.4236,1.1271,5.3141,0.6634,7.653,0.7135,6.1424,5.4966,2.5534,2.9765,0.1057,5.8427,1.2355,4.9352,0.2704,4.5686,2.8097,1.6376,4.2748,0.2064,0.4989,4.2243,3.6886,1.2887,0.9796,0.6637,0.7885,0.8176,1.5261,3.6797,4.7754,6.0509,0.9945,4.6851,0.8952,0.2596,5.9327,3.753,2.4243,1.8889,4.0821,1.839,5.4289,0.0122,5.8959,1.3616,0.3354,4.2532,0.1306,3.6566,2.8155,2.5992,0.7109,0.5046]}
{"prompt":"A group of 38 U.S. senators asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to abandon plans to lower biofuel requirements for oil refiners in 2018 , according to a letter made public by the","text":"A group of 38 U.S. senators asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to abandon plans to lower biofuel requirements for oil refiners in 2018, according to a letter made public by the group.\nAs detailed in the letter, the 38 senators -- who represent areas in which ethanol, corn, and biodiesel are economically viable, like the Middle West -- say the EPA should focus on eliminating carbon emissions, and should not make sweeping changes that adversely affect the U.S. oil pollination industry.\nThe letter was signed by California Sen. Richard Pan of Fresno and New Mexico Sen. Ruben Gallego of Silver City, to name two prominent biodiesel proponents, and also by Sen. Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the representative in that Congressional House of Representative from the ethanol industry. The senators are all members of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\nThe EPA's \"Project Interagency\" initiative to reduce requirements for biodiesel production by 5 to 10 million barrels per day by 2018 was announced on Oct. 8. The announcement sparked a surge in stock trading in two major corn producers, Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Cargill, in anticipation of the likely lower price for soybeans.\nThe letter said the U.S. ethanol industry has received no funding under the $12-billion tax overhaul of 2017, and instead has had to absorb increased costs associated with the program. One of the initiatives announced for this year was to pay for the production of ethanol through \"tax credits to fuel retailers,\" according to the letter. The tax cuts, it said, would not cover the cost of the production of ethanol, which is funded exclusively by producer payments and mandates.\n\"Ethanol is the lifeblood of more than 150,000 U.S. families who rely in local communities to provide high-quality jobs that enable them to provide for the dignity and education of their families,\" the letter said.\nThe letter urged the EPA to direct its workforce and resources to combating greenhouse gas emissions and to remove the unnecessary barriers the ethanol industry faces to producing fuel from agricultural sources.","token_len":449,"entropy":[7.1549,0.3239,7.8978,4.8593,0.0532,0.015,0.0625,2.1678,5.1918,1.3582,3.0896,0.0005,0.0558,0.0023,5.1847,0.0001,0.0019,3.5181,1.9688,0.1707,6.7336,2.162,0.276,6.0655,8.5305,2.2379,3.8755,0.7389,4.0076,2.5345,4.2785,2.8811,6.0859,1.6994,3.3687,0.0017,1.0608,1.4452,6.603,0.0575,0.9275,0.7482,1.4054,0.7289,0.2035,18.0445,6.5076,0.4006,0.7675,0.6399,0.3526,0.544,10.0842,0.4501,5.9774,2.9916,2.6594,5.3882,2.923,1.281,4.1794,4.6395,4.3683,1.2191,1.0512,3.4076,0.0,1.1863,5.6409,1.099,3.1105,4.4875,2.3832,5.0993,4.7907,1.114,4.1653,1.4894,1.2919,1.8464,4.416,0.3124,5.0387,4.7308,1.0337,2.7907,2.8581,4.3327,2.3839,4.2768,6.7714,0.6316,2.8638,7.5135,0.3444,1.3853,2.91,0.0002,0.0008,0.0596,3.2354,11.0487,7.4336,0.9976,0.2235,0.1937,4.977,1.5505,2.6587,1.4286,0.0144,5.7318,1.1383,0.0008,4.3732,5.8275,3.0719,10.8416,1.4881,3.0682,2.1262,0.44,0.0003,8.4255,0.0128,0.985,0.0016,0.0441,0.3041,10.0079,4.5443,1.114,6.163,4.3349,3.9799,5.7178,7.9618,0.0032,3.0521,1.9376,2.7683,4.1173,1.4598,4.126,0.0012,4.6591,0.837,1.8137,3.0686,1.4185,0.0101,0.3358,0.9803,1.3015,0.0424,0.1755,2.1937,0.0297,0.0019,0.0001,0.0658,1.8947,1.3909,1.7684,0.0014,4.4648,0.0001,0.0002,1.1638,0.0141,0.8294,0.8539,8.8543,4.1187,6.2413,7.4228,9.7161,2.3932,5.8223,2.4923,2.2758,7.5721,0.9222,0.2102,3.4423,1.4383,2.8999,3.2498,1.6184,0.0099,0.2119,1.3778,3.7421,0.0809,1.9871,0.1152,0.0163,0.0109,0.741,0.0979,1.2139,3.5834,1.7031,4.9289,7.397,8.0371,3.8336,4.175,4.0477,3.2209,2.0223,7.0023,0.4215,2.0841,0.0004,4.1858,4.5534,5.409,2.8075,0.7921,5.6794,0.6945,0.671,0.2191,2.1531,2.7861,2.9425,3.0616,3.1419,3.4756,0.0051,3.3521,1.001,1.2815,5.3298,5.8155,1.3315,6.237,0.2374,10.4114,3.5814,2.2284,5.6174,1.9225,6.3126,4.3392,0.8982,7.9618,0.0055,0.0072,0.0022,1.8525,0.1406,0.2392,4.1328,0.3003,0.001,1.3458,3.9278,2.6521,0.0994,1.1401,6.1076,5.9326,3.3698,2.3554,6.8937,0.8428,1.438,0.6295,1.308,2.7364,3.2706,0.9768,3.4316,0.0004,0.0018,0.002,3.3427,0.2757,2.355,4.5803,4.2727,4.4194,3.7344,0.3065,4.9055,4.4327,3.4468,0.1452,6.1183,5.7967,5.1708,5.41,1.2318,0.9778,6.5649,1.4117,4.0081,0.4516,5.8465,5.3216,0.6684,3.4522,0.007,1.7994,4.304,0.8676,6.6123,0.7444,0.1762,8.0444,5.1129,4.4745,3.1444,0.5355,1.7374,1.0626,5.3889,0.8668,2.0393,5.2076,0.2485,1.6191,3.1665,4.4332,4.8671,0.4649,3.1369,4.0283,6.0446,2.1662,2.5109,0.0011,0.169,0.3345,0.25,2.3187,4.1319,7.2157,2.7407,3.8822,0.5541,0.0147,0.6704,4.0694,4.4645,1.4047,1.3063,0.0714,2.0203,3.7075,0.267,1.0794,2.1752,1.4936,1.5218,7.8206,6.4013,0.6098,8.2182,5.8526,2.7546,6.7999,0.6312,0.2656,1.8283,4.4383,0.0283,0.0174,1.3221,2.4777,6.2824,0.0361,0.0798,8.1544,0.1301,4.8044,1.7004,0.0014,1.3645,0.0002,0.0011,0.0047,4.7303,3.561,1.3093,7.2794,7.9069,0.9227,2.286,2.7506,5.7454,0.9277,0.0981,5.8584,4.7502,4.8411,0.5034,0.0177,3.975,1.4592,3.5931,5.8696,0.9947,4.7846,0.3235,0.1969,2.4929,0.4661,0.3383,0.9253,0.4318,0.0786,0.6202,0.9932,1.3518,5.056,0.5019,0.317,0.1428,7.5595,1.2389,4.6213,3.1406,3.8277,0.2932,7.5416,3.6218,0.4828,0.117,1.9211,1.5034,5.6282,1.902,4.6122,3.2382,5.5507,2.0965,0.0781,1.0707,1.466,2.7754,4.206,3.2065,6.4723,2.5589,0.5588]}

{"prompt":"The workforce at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is on course to fall to its lowest level since Ronald Reagan was president , an agency official said on Tuesday . In June , the EPA","text":"The workforce at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is on course to fall to its lowest level since Ronald Reagan was president, an agency official said on Tuesday. In June, the EPA will make a final determination on whether to remove 10,000 workers who have been hired to help clean \u2026\nIt is important to note that the amount of fuel cells that are currently installed with storage capacity in the United States is small compared to battery storage. Still, this industry is increasing every day, especially in the USA.\nIn the U.S. alone, there\u2019s about 14 million installed storage sites for battery and fuel cell vehicles, and it is expected that by 2025, the storage capacity will reach about 80 terahertz (TWh), which is equivalent to the current installed energy storage capacity of countries such as Germany, China or Japan.\nDespite the growth of the storage sector in the United States, much of it is concentrated in California.\nIn the past year, the state reached new records in the storage sector: the largest system built in Europe last year was located in Santa Clara, with 1.5 megawatts (MW) installed on electric vehicles and a capacity of 50 MW \u2013 and the state aims to increase this number by more than 2,000% by 2024.\nThis is an excellent performance when it comes to storage because it is expected that in 2024, the state of California will be able to store 8 TWh of energy, making it the state that has the largest installed storage capacity in the world. The state has an installed storage capacity greater than countries such as Israel, Turkey or India.\nCalifornia is also the United States with the largest fleet of electric vehicles (EVs): according to the California Department of Energy Resources (DEER), between 2010 and 2018, in this state have been added 5 million vehicles to the fleet: 1 million of them were new electric vehicles.\nThe United States has recently experienced a reduction in the cost of the production of electric vehicles, resulting in the growth of the fleet of new vehicles being less expensive than the ones with internal combustion engine (ICE). In Europe, where the electric vehicles are more expensive, the reduction in the cost has not been so significant.","token_len":449,"entropy":[10.88,3.5269,1.5715,4.6017,0.1916,0.0375,0.0961,4.8092,0.0002,0.0006,1.8523,4.439,4.714,0.2005,5.3114,2.4709,2.5629,0.0958,0.1615,0.7004,7.6328,0.0037,3.2931,1.0463,1.1468,4.8652,2.0169,1.5773,0.3488,2.4829,1.8454,0.1664,4.8986,4.3,0.3514,0.8758,2.5487,4.8209,4.9499,2.3531,3.0827,2.9812,0.4653,1.2521,0.5894,5.3029,5.9564,0.3932,0.0971,2.6811,3.7431,2.035,1.0607,3.9214,2.1459,3.3671,2.3694,16.2367,2.7918,13.2018,1.9864,4.9294,0.1801,0.3917,0.2269,1.1228,6.4901,0.0652,7.0922,8.2151,2.103,1.3009,3.6218,3.4007,6.0517,7.6063,3.0629,2.5243,0.7231,2.4563,0.0048,0.7872,3.8155,0.6842,0.3746,8.0032,1.5996,2.1943,6.0109,0.0569,3.3459,6.1672,1.1312,5.8442,5.2198,1.3136,1.2504,4.1297,1.1296,1.0223,8.0323,0.9355,1.3868,3.0859,1.8625,2.7056,0.0007,0.094,2.0774,1.9229,0.1124,2.1749,18.0682,6.7431,3.645,1.8162,4.9051,1.5715,6.5038,3.0444,7.4472,3.0897,4.3011,3.184,4.6308,1.155,3.2467,1.2868,2.1469,4.2359,0.6548,1.9549,0.9446,1.3477,2.8659,0.6823,2.1336,5.8,0.7808,1.057,2.1172,2.7627,4.3102,6.4957,5.8048,0.3794,0.0013,1.9605,4.0359,0.4432,1.8238,2.6725,0.3697,3.528,0.0125,2.6692,2.874,6.3401,5.3087,1.4469,0.1953,0.395,11.0726,1.5832,0.0028,2.2843,0.7776,3.3406,3.9766,1.2765,0.2419,0.7789,5.6719,1.1403,4.6288,1.3487,1.3712,2.9189,3.1354,1.8958,0.4497,1.5268,0.0038,0.2271,5.5929,0.1908,1.5312,0.7428,3.1019,0.1353,3.5731,1.511,1.8224,2.3659,1.8884,2.6722,2.3202,0.4007,1.5708,2.9594,8.4091,4.9577,2.6995,2.0663,1.8187,3.5077,1.8865,4.7135,2.8385,3.6557,7.7435,5.7465,0.9797,7.0935,5.5897,0.2247,1.1737,4.2184,0.3871,2.8814,1.8217,1.4905,4.5564,2.9589,0.933,2.1212,3.4777,0.0524,1.5335,0.0771,0.1472,2.3963,4.0975,7.0733,2.49,2.616,4.0132,2.995,0.1483,4.9339,1.9717,6.0518,4.6895,2.0897,2.6284,8.7841,0.0459,3.1249,2.0555,3.3035,1.4488,3.6238,0.0536,4.3053,2.1854,0.3053,5.6832,0.7447,4.4466,0.3601,0.4918,3.8465,1.5599,2.9557,4.9156,5.2221,4.8726,2.2514,0.0169,0.0058,3.4539,5.6981,1.0228,1.7191,5.1241,0.8735,3.4374,3.8076,0.4543,1.2846,1.2933,3.8695,0.0221,0.2038,1.9753,1.3391,0.0106,3.2848,4.9406,5.7271,0.0026,0.4262,2.1598,2.1118,4.2753,0.3563,0.3712,4.1831,3.0231,1.4505,0.2949,1.272,2.4864,1.0421,0.4967,0.8615,0.0746,1.0202,0.3648,3.2039,1.7464,1.8582,4.0629,3.1326,2.5422,0.1694,8.2573,0.0512,10.9328,0.9026,0.0032,4.8393,0.7614,4.2257,2.4994,3.5734,0.9255,0.4055,2.7256,1.4473,1.6797,1.7701,6.2377,0.052,4.2373,0.3998,0.9062,5.297,0.1038,3.0797,0.4573,3.24,0.7533,0.2265,4.9288,4.9768,0.0017,1.1022,3.1274,1.1293,0.001,1.1264,7.7353,2.1746,2.9496,0.2731,0.191,5.7257,3.0313,0.0879,4.5903,0.1938,6.0157,5.7238,1.4168,8.6753,2.7682,4.8395,4.0266,4.295,1.59,2.206,1.072,1.4647,3.6576,3.8455,3.0995,1.5456,1.6401,2.523,4.6738,2.784,0.3216,1.0105,0.6805,2.0848,4.5826,0.0292,1.5774,5.6007,3.4083,1.2371,6.5619,0.1045,1.3311,4.9621,0.0746,4.1917,4.0626,0.1609,2.2521,0.3459,1.8459,4.4413,0.0538,1.7845,5.5963,0.2966,1.1393,4.5846,1.0022,3.2354,2.12,3.8275,6.4378,0.7131,1.2382,1.4861,4.3928,5.6992,5.9103,0.0372,1.9106,1.4578,1.5939,1.7782,2.507,5.8829,0.2408,3.4472,1.3875,3.411,1.409,0.6715,3.2902,1.4908,1.0585,1.0339,4.146,0.3805,0.9887,0.6323,3.042,3.9948,0.9769,3.3296,2.3633,0.6621]}

The authority to travel into the country does not apply to members of the Security Council of the United Nations who represent states with military governments.\nRoth said the ban on his freedom of movement made it difficult for him to gather vital information and interviewed potential witnesses in various parts of the country. Roth said he was unaware of the reason for the ban and asked fellow commission members how they planned to pursue their investigations in the country of 100 million people.\nRoth was part of a UN committee that published a damning report earlier this year on human rights violations in Myanmar. His report cited instances of torture, arbitrary arrests, and restrictions on political rights that had been going on for decades by the military-dominated government of Myanmar s previous leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.\nThe commission was given the authority to investigate cases of human rights violations in Myanmar during an UN Security Council meeting last month.

The U.S. Geological Survey said","text":"A powerful magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the island of Java in Indonesia just before midnight on Friday, with authorities reporting three deaths and damage to hundreds of buildings. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was the biggest quake ever recorded in Indonesia. Local authorities in Central Java said that the magnitude 6 quake was felt in a large region that includes city of Yogyakarta, the capital of the island. The quake had a depth of 44 kilometers, USGS reported. The death toll brought the official U.S. count of people killed in tropical storms in the West Indies to 19, with nine in Antigua and Barbuda, five in the British Virgin Islands, four in the Virgin Islands, and two in Montserrat. An additional 41 people were wounded in Antigua and Barbuda, according to the Antigua and Barbuda Disaster Management Office. Hurricane Matthew, which became a major Category Four storm on Sunday, hit the British Virgin Islands Sunday and then the Virgin Islands Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said. Hurricane Matthew is an unusual storm to make landfall in the islands because normally only Category Three storms are expected. The agency said the winds and rain carried by Matthew will bring significant impacts for several days. The hurricane, which was still moving south in a strong Category Four storm on Friday, forced at least 100 people to evacuate Antigua's capital, St. John's. Schools and other facilities including an airport in the capital were closed in anticipation of another powerful storm, which hit Barbuda and the island of Montserrat Friday as a dangerous Category Three hurricane. The Antigua and Barbuda Disaster Management Office put out a status report on Monday afternoon. The agency said that a school in Barbuda was closed, that no land-based infrastructure had been damaged, and that no homes had been destroyed, nor had property been damaged on the ground. Across the islands, about 3,500 people were evacuated due to the approaching storm. The British Virgin Islands, which is the largest of the Virgin Islands, had no casualties or damage to homes announced by officials. Matthew moved into the southern Caribbean late on Friday. It made landfall on Jamaica Saturday morning before it began to dissipate around the island this afternoon.","token_len":450,"entropy":[9.443,10.3867,1.8085,0.0739,2.1438,0.2859,0.2128,0.401,6.0617,0.0501,5.9422,2.6566,3.9149,6.9586,0.6579,2.4901,1.8098,1.7272,0.4433,3.7102,4.582,2.4194,5.1173,0.9521,0.5108,4.6409,0.6326,4.1346,0.1578,1.5072,0.5012,2.3787,5.5103,0.0071,0.1132,0.1084,0.0753,0.0022,0.6204,1.577,0.3257,1.3038,2.4329,3.4394,2.5044,2.3318,0.3283,0.9543,2.6638,0.7,5.7048,3.0275,2.6937,7.0264,0.2433,1.0863,3.9899,2.4662,3.7079,0.4166,5.7709,1.4081,2.4551,1.9134,2.8295,4.5132,4.341,3.9053,2.0898,7.9386,1.5934,5.592,0.5832,0.0098,0.0002,1.1133,2.6047,0.5365,0.7958,1.2749,4.7258,2.4151,1.74,1.1472,4.8026,1.5851,2.2365,0.07,6.8727,1.5939,2.2988,7.1316,0.1419,2.714,0.3151,1.7428,5.8194,0.0051,8.3822,0.6713,6.1898,6.9424,0.0076,0.0825,0.0214,2.7564,1.1586,4.1248,0.5589,1.5865,8.5262,3.7945,4.0285,0.8098,5.9861,4.9421,0.4829,4.8223,1.4341,1.8663,3.7992,3.0521,9.2841,0.0522,0.0004,0.5384,0.0488,0.0035,1.1949,2.2501,0.0548,1.4418,3.8612,0.1069,0.0006,0.8736,1.8837,0.0293,0.9546,5.7945,0.0011,0.8324,1.9578,1.6783,0.105,8.5188,0.0406,0.0002,0.8848,5.2538,3.0003,5.6027,0.2944,0.47,3.6531,0.9853,6.3939,0.0053,0.009,0.2702,0.1,0.0009,0.8601,2.4093,0.0012,0.7832,6.7489,0.0177,0.0778,0.5807,0.0106,0.0063,2.4665,0.6876,2.6903,0.3378,7.3238,2.6588,2.7219,0.4758,6.3624,0.9602,3.4892,2.518,7.4444,0.7201,1.6116,1.7046,0.221,3.4516,0.7734,6.4979,0.0639,0.0072,5.2914,2.7315,5.1725,3.1972,4.2633,0.0162,4.7648,1.1614,3.139,2.929,0.2555,0.2224,0.3499,0.2824,3.8993,2.0885,1.942,5.178,3.6376,1.698,3.3801,3.0922,0.0106,0.4072,0.6782,7.412,3.8919,9.9526,6.0858,4.196,3.6256,0.4553,1.4629,2.0274,1.9065,1.6077,6.5632,0.6067,1.644,4.1336,2.4333,2.1315,7.0367,2.924,1.3589,3.5709,3.9055,6.1371,5.8299,3.6559,4.7757,1.2418,0.7158,1.5639,2.7005,3.3632,0.4348,2.3577,5.7963,2.6077,2.975,2.9646,3.1708,3.6154,2.8871,4.2598,1.56,2.1348,3.3629,0.1523,5.5277,3.9879,0.0019,4.4455,1.7744,0.3945,0.248,10.2081,0.0074,0.0049,4.5903,3.275,1.1792,6.6341,0.2051,3.0221,0.1065,1.6322,7.8793,2.1777,2.2644,2.2151,6.4825,6.3139,2.0825,2.8329,1.5606,1.068,0.6332,0.7527,3.3753,4.501,0.0446,5.6164,4.3466,1.5824,1.7974,2.7083,3.3812,6.6301,0.4339,2.1415,1.5324,3.2496,0.4541,5.4323,0.0029,0.0003,5.2592,5.7817,2.7527,7.9747,1.5423,2.5819,1.9756,0.5018,1.5445,5.776,0.0162,0.0174,1.0334,0.0618,0.0017,0.3984,0.0428,0.0303,7.7706,1.3282,0.3111,7.1567,2.8559,1.3386,1.8802,4.146,1.8764,1.5908,2.866,0.4366,2.1375,3.4451,6.4999,0.5664,4.2061,0.0195,1.1774,1.4455,3.3358,7.2819,4.8274,7.5698,4.6166,1.1341,3.608,2.6729,0.016,1.7365,0.5522,0.1437,0.1555,2.6705,4.0488,0.864,0.0428,1.8437,3.0768,7.0991,2.0577,4.6072,3.8301,0.527,4.6799,0.6789,3.5161,0.3284,8.2503,0.2414,4.2046,0.2034,4.2711,3.6373,0.2235,1.7087,0.5704,0.8363,1.6624,4.2151,0.0019,1.0118,8.7937,0.7936,1.1576,1.7127,5.536,0.0594,0.0125,2.1246,1.0443,1.33,2.8051,2.6735,1.9868,0.1873,6.9186,0.0034,0.4763,2.6725,4.6567,5.2185,2.731,0.4588,2.0229,3.4587,9.2627,1.7569,2.8475,0.8655,7.1512,5.4321,3.0089,0.6256,3.5018,2.1444,3.4618,1.9657,1.8509,1.8463,2.1285,4.1754,0.0387,1.9602,6.4855,6.2868,2.1077,5.6967,3.7303,4.7229,2.0833,6.1932,0.0017,3.3382,2.539,2.6026,6.217,1.3337,0.2718]}

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he was not looking for the corporate tax rate reduction that the White House is seeks to be phased in over time . \u201c Hopefully not , \u201d","text":"President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he was not looking for the corporate tax rate reduction that the White House is seeks to be phased in over time. \u201c Hopefully not, \u201d Trump told CNBC. He said the administration was pursuing that goal more on the basis of an overhang from the corporate tax rate cuts that he\u2019s imposed in the past. And he said even if it does lead to higher corporate tax rates, that was preferable to what happened with the Bush tax cuts and what happened to Democrats during the 2008 global financial crisis. \u201c I could be wrong, \u201d he said. \u201c It could create real big problems. \u201d Trump\u2019s comments come before Senate Republicans have reached a possible agreement to reduce the corporate tax rate of current 35 percent to 33.3 percent. That would also apply to the income tax rate. The Trump administration argues that the corporate tax rate reduction \u2013 and a similar potential tax rate reduction for individual income tax \u2013 could be beneficial in the short and long term to the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, Democrats are pushing for the tax rate reduction to be phased in over time. If approved by Congress, it could be implemented by the end of this year or early in the new year. But Democratic legislators and President Barack Obama, in a letter shared by CNBC earlier on Tuesday, said that it should not go into effect even if the administration can muster the needed support to keep it off the books through a Senate bill. \u201c It\u2019s not a problem that can wait,\u201d said Rep. Justin Amash ( R Michigan), whose district includes the steel mills of Kalamazoo, Mich., as well as the Boeing plant in Renton, Wash. The two major tax rate reductions were also announced alongside President Bill Clinton\u2019s signature tax-cut package in 1993, which also raised the federal corporate tax rate to 33.3 percent. But they have not been used by the Trump administration, which argues that the economy has improved. Republicans say the higher tax rates are an attack on business. The Senate could vote on the tax rate changes later this month, but President Barack Obama would not let them go ahead without first securing the Senate\u2019s support.","token_len":450,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,3.4669,1.8901,2.2773,0.4292,0.9602,2.2165,2.9362,4.5444,1.4407,3.1204,9.2874,2.4021,0.9224,4.6623,1.8823,2.8473,2.6109,0.0004,1.6526,12.5398,1.5562,6.4436,5.8732,0.3601,2.2491,2.1814,0.5442,14.5183,6.7478,11.3907,5.3439,2.5207,7.1059,7.2411,2.5477,2.1216,2.9867,1.4292,3.7351,1.4668,2.3233,2.0189,2.4781,5.0046,4.5432,1.94,6.2795,5.0037,1.3804,3.2287,0.1965,4.3442,7.0506,3.501,5.1538,1.1805,1.7845,0.1897,0.2024,3.9629,2.3132,3.0495,15.2971,7.7845,2.2031,9.3292,2.3461,1.1588,1.6054,0.7894,5.3333,0.9312,0.9234,7.1881,0.8572,2.0972,3.2586,5.3937,0.0367,3.0168,0.8913,0.6768,0.1077,0.3048,2.5506,3.747,8.3477,0.4246,4.1218,4.5976,2.0328,0.6858,1.7999,0.3107,0.0698,2.6452,2.7515,1.4037,5.2552,8.1765,3.3351,0.3308,3.6095,7.952,0.5565,0.1054,0.3446,2.6541,0.5558,4.5667,5.8026,3.0945,0.0856,1.1613,1.3406,0.5211,1.1971,0.4692,0.4378,2.197,0.4336,3.7348,3.0378,6.0003,5.6609,7.6174,1.5783,1.7873,1.8454,2.4163,4.7397,2.5136,0.5398,0.5897,2.8135,2.9652,5.3441,4.9856,1.1597,3.5482,5.3558,0.7644,6.8518,1.7291,2.3175,3.5155,0.4036,0.1191,0.2848,0.0367,5.3143,9.0634,6.3435,0.4924,1.4286,4.669,2.3013,3.1001,0.0133,0.8444,3.3157,1.0408,4.934,4.968,0.1122,2.337,5.0314,1.002,2.36,2.2487,2.3852,4.4228,0.2973,5.4259,0.2626,1.7615,2.1551,0.3726,0.1402,2.7416,7.0472,3.1337,4.0554,4.5145,8.7579,1.7774,3.0581,0.7982,1.5015,2.3025,2.0592,0.8358,3.0896,2.9304,1.8516,5.1767,3.4155,2.0262,2.0559,3.7789,1.3027,0.3128,2.8039,1.1282,1.8242,0.0003,0.0008,0.115,0.0555,0.4892,6.4585,0.0395,3.4371,1.7284,2.394,0.5978,2.4369,3.2317,1.8492,1.7744,0.5177,0.5816,0.5115,0.2671,0.6644,0.4834,0.8888,4.4606,4.6433,1.3039,0.6409,0.2928,1.7669,2.3644,1.9548,2.8673,1.3803,1.6763,0.1716,0.0008,1.8873,0.217,2.8136,2.3144,3.9628,1.6388,2.8088,0.5089,0.3531,3.2531,6.097,5.6521,3.0238,4.4964,0.7932,0.002,3.6272,3.32,1.8064,1.9936,8.0439,1.5159,5.2246,4.1429,2.6695,0.2081,0.0974,1.536,1.2319,3.163,4.565,0.8627,4.4241,0.91,0.0134,6.4513,0.8691,1.2267,3.1776,4.7258,4.4274,1.3446,4.588,1.936,1.1907,3.7303,1.5341,4.7913,0.1576,0.4667,4.4776,2.8648,4.7561,3.9566,0.5728,3.4937,0.6933,3.4573,1.9148,0.7783,0.012,2.068,2.1022,4.7848,2.5266,2.6875,6.5089,2.4902,1.941,0.4995,1.8564,1.3851,0.0015,4.736,0.0026,0.0,1.1181,8.0404,9.4003,2.9829,4.9274,0.8112,0.5889,2.458,7.078,2.1217,2.6198,4.625,0.0034,0.0031,1.1775,0.8409,0.5579,3.8204,0.1084,0.0069,1.7254,7.7548,0.4144,0.6341,7.3107,0.7545,0.2288,0.4254,0.5555,2.5772,4.0496,5.1359,5.876,4.2476,0.9123,3.3104,4.396,3.5886,7.0999,4.4898,6.2444,0.01,1.8526,0.4914,0.0394,3.9205,3.4559,4.2565,0.3329,2.4712,1.3899,1.8799,2.0725,1.8827,3.556,4.4557,0.7642,3.3952,0.3826,1.1846,0.0243,1.0811,2.9243,1.2077,0.8098,0.0204,0.6014,2.9436,3.5613,2.6243,1.4339,0.9143,5.6858,2.8955,1.5483,0.988,0.0597,2.6489,1.7617,4.0721,0.2535,1.3962,6.536,2.8202,3.2594,2.8849,5.2947,2.5958,1.4299,5.717,2.9021,0.7776,2.1854,3.2821,4.944,0.0501,3.3918,1.8791,2.3112,4.1437,4.6519,2.5189,0.8299,0.7689,1.9493,2.3567,3.6715,3.7324,0.2641,1.2206,1.1672,1.371,5.6966,1.4425,0.0021,4.7715,1.1584,5.5355,3.052,0.6371,3.3209,2.6809,5.3903,4.1781,2.0045,3.0237,8.7155,0.2781,0.0219,0.8803,0.7065]}

RT's journalists have been barred from entering the United States. U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to meet at the G20 summit in Osaka. The two nations have clashed often in the past over questions of how the countries should deal with the United States' sanctions and tensions over the Ukrainian crisis.\nIn a meeting in Paris, U.S. President Donald Trump asked if he could say things he couldn't elsewhere, Reuters reported, noting the comments came after he warned in July that he could halt U.S. economic sanctions against Russia if Moscow attacked Syria. Trump, while offering his usual unashamedly insulting language, told Russian President Vladimir Putin \"You're one of the greatest presidents ever.\" Trump also said that the U.S. was \"with Russia in dealing with ISIS and also in dealing with the threat of North Korea coming into the South [of] Korea\" and that he hoped the two countries would be allies in the future. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson left Tokyo soon after Putin's arrival.\n\"At the end of the G-20 summit we will have a very clear picture of how serious the threat is and where we go forward together,\" Tillerson told reporters. \"He [Moscow] wanted to hold a high level conversation with President Trump and he had it while he was in the room.\" Tillerson said Putin did not mention the issue of Syria. However, he expressed the U.S. commitment to an international military operation in Syria, a point that was also reiterated by senior administration officials. Putin said the goal was to reduce U.S. support for the Syrian government.","token_len":452,"entropy":[6.1627,1.9316,1.9714,0.8978,1.6684,5.6156,6.1046,0.2999,2.4436,4.6263,0.004,0.3018,0.0622,6.894,4.1547,0.0106,5.8312,4.0061,2.0116,4.6166,4.1127,0.079,1.8464,2.6072,0.2699,5.973,3.056,1.8871,5.9518,0.8008,8.6234,1.6746,2.1354,1.2659,9.3487,0.9785,3.335,1.9629,0.4988,0.0002,0.0017,0.4243,3.7256,5.0063,0.0706,0.5894,0.1507,22.2864,1.1709,0.0053,2.2964,3.1161,7.0222,0.0929,0.9929,2.4447,0.0307,6.7127,0.6999,1.3841,2.0596,3.2406,2.2672,2.6419,2.889,3.1645,2.1645,3.3463,0.015,1.085,3.253,2.3198,0.0031,5.3413,0.3386,1.9076,0.5497,0.7368,19.0415,1.5551,5.5696,1.7114,6.2327,0.4066,0.1331,0.2223,5.8859,1.4632,6.0047,1.201,0.3328,6.0437,3.521,0.3611,2.3889,1.6574,2.5616,1.9945,2.8416,4.517,1.2057,0.0015,4.0543,3.4854,4.9188,2.3495,4.9712,3.5836,0.0931,0.0269,2.2179,1.3493,2.4963,4.9384,0.0057,4.2862,1.298,1.2953,0.2756,5.2519,2.8628,4.6666,1.2321,0.9757,4.9068,0.1932,1.9218,0.2791,1.227,0.0037,1.9837,6.6461,0.0004,0.0099,0.0104,2.8103,4.7693,3.0232,0.7497,0.0823,0.0325,0.0073,3.2232,2.538,0.0259,0.2278,2.7126,0.3683,1.1798,0.5382,0.3327,0.3739,14.7175,3.398,3.7054,1.9201,2.7108,1.0981,5.4253,5.2917,1.526,1.409,0.5963,1.1906,6.1929,0.9068,4.1491,2.2749,7.7111,2.7415,2.7963,0.0081,1.869,3.8401,0.0168,2.9478,4.2017,2.8784,4.8013,0.8064,1.9877,4.7654,0.2958,0.1893,0.3287,11.5056,1.1769,4.0103,2.1479,5.2685,1.458,3.3145,0.0003,0.0374,0.008,1.3489,0.3985,0.0089,5.1366,5.2264,2.0946,0.5314,6.6526,5.4807,2.9663,4.3516,0.0004,10.6508,1.7705,5.8662,0.1105,1.6925,4.5727,2.5352,6.7331,2.3105,1.5531,2.4263,4.8951,4.2313,4.0695,0.399,2.4312,3.2058,6.6219,1.6241,0.0003,0.0112,0.1433,3.9801,0.7392,0.579,0.1991,2.0393,2.6561,4.857,3.8535,0.6039,2.8077,3.7059,5.503,5.9238,3.059,4.4864,6.7216,5.076,0.0008,3.604,7.3256,2.3036,0.7293,4.8298,3.1293,0.9811,0.0359,0.0046,3.2474,3.3093,1.6705,6.5201,0.5485,0.2978,2.2057,6.1931,2.0837,1.5036,3.2765,1.8056,1.5757,2.0196,2.3323,1.378,0.0005,0.0081,0.0331,2.1714,1.4399,6.7062,2.5072,2.0724,7.2501,0.0226,4.1446,1.9901,5.8865,3.3853,1.5549,0.0103,2.1725,4.995,0.5833,2.1553,0.0507,6.8458,2.1539,1.2264,6.2778,7.1589,4.8136,3.4894,3.2526,2.6978,0.623,1.7871,1.5244,3.5559,1.636,2.3996,0.8589,0.5299,2.6521,3.9093,1.5595,1.0867,4.0582,0.1023,5.1914,0.0006,0.0051,0.0205,2.1473,0.0009,0.0054,0.01,0.0007,7.0747,5.9214,7.3611,0.03,4.7486,1.6223,3.5856,1.5348,0.6307,3.3203,5.574,0.9982,1.0352,0.035,0.2102,10.5621,3.8266,0.0395,1.4396,3.4886,1.7429,2.6252,1.1882,2.1499,2.3911,3.5714,0.5481,2.1709,4.7342,1.4738,2.9993,0.8929,1.6063,3.4139,0.7215,6.1117,6.4258,6.7336,0.5054,1.296,1.0119,0.2461,1.3511,1.1239,4.9244,4.5873,8.1023,0.0208,6.4003,0.4036,5.8741,2.0201,4.7153,0.6852,3.565,1.4378,3.6198,0.4424,1.5456,2.3503,4.4946,5.7879,7.5479,0.9099,0.1243,1.5327,2.796,2.2106,1.2733,2.693,1.5553,3.3726,3.5028,0.1436,4.8183,1.3923,3.2969,1.5458,2.789,2.5108,4.8621,0.0337,1.1928,5.1992,4.3015,3.6121,0.0008,0.0065,0.2569,3.6628,0.086,5.2553,3.0189,4.1137,4.822,1.7033,0.5947,1.5765,3.2328,4.5085,1.5403,2.4355,4.0018,2.3396,0.705,5.1486,2.4714,0.0315,0.9114,5.0066,2.2313,2.1226,5.9005,1.0441,0.4375,5.7498,4.2721,0.0004,0.0013,0.1414,3.7388,0.2562,1.5411,0.8536,0.7896,1.7147]}

PHOTO: REUTERS\nLula, 64, had been campaigning with his rival ahead of the election on Friday to garner support to launch a campaign that could see him face the right-wing former military leader Jose Maria Marin in October, according to party sources.\nCardoso and the center-right Rede Sustentabilidade party have also signaled that they will support any of the candidates who do not appeal to the voters of the party Cardoso currently leads, Brazil daily Folha de S. Paulo said.\nLula supporters have already accused Alckmin, who held the Sao Paulo governor s post from 1996 to 2001, of authoritarian traits and for the destruction of public services by allowing the city s property values to fall with the crisis.\nLast year, Alckmin came under fire after he forced municipalities to pay off their bond portfolios with a fund which he had raised on his own.\nAlckmin has now stepped down from his position as the governor of S\u00e3o Paulo s largest city and said he would not contest the state of Sao Paulo, where he would also be retiring.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on November 30, 2007, with the headline 'Sao Paulo gov to challenge President Lula for presidency'.

In a 2017 interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Sunday, Trump named Brownback as a candidate for secretary of defense.\nThe Washington Post reported that the Trump pick was in a race with acting secretary of defense Patrick Shanahan, but the president ultimately chosen Brownback following a meeting with Brownback at Trump Tower in late September.\nAfter Trump\u2019s swearing-in as president on Wednesday, Brownback, who had been serving as governor for three months, announced that he wanted to leave office \u2014 in light of a legal dispute and his reluctance to endorse Trump.

But his resignation is also a blow for the President, and a victory for the people\u2019s rights and the principles that have forged America\u2019s greatness.\nThe Republican Party is on the defensive after Donald Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, forcing Congress to halt the certifications of the 2020 election results. Trump initially falsely called the election\na \u201crigged\u201d one, before later tweeting that \u201clawlessness\u201d had broken out at the Capitol, saying there were \u201cvery angry people\u201d there. A few hours later, CNN\u2019s senior legal analyst Michael\nGerstein warned Trump and his supporters not to expect them to be able to change the election results as a result of their \u201crioting\u201d in the Capitol. But he said that the Republican Party has a responsibility to ensure that their leaders will come up to the plate in order to end the ongoing violence. Trump has vowed to contest the election results, but has yet to officially concede, and he could face further legal ramifications in the days to come.\nThe former vice president, who has not fully acknowledged to the president, has come under fire from within the GOP for supporting Trump\u2019s false claims and defending his violent supporters.\nThe latest push to disqualify the former vice president from campaigning came on Friday when Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) urged fellow Republican lawmakers to push for legislation to prohibit Trump in future elections. \u201c\nIf President Trump were eligible to run again, we do not know who would win in that hypothetical election,\u201d Cheney reportedly said.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s running mate, Kamala Harris, has repeatedly said on air and in a series of tweets that she will accept the results of the election, regardless of the outcome.","token_len":453,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,7.1287,3.0057,4.3484,0.0045,5.7121,3.7626,0.7315,1.0649,2.0455,1.8491,1.1632,3.1516,1.1602,0.4059,2.8345,5.7488,0.1694,1.9146,2.061,5.6186,0.0836,3.9664,0.5226,0.9881,0.0199,0.3999,0.355,4.0638,1.8768,3.636,0.0007,0.5559,0.5315,0.2346,0.8786,0.2607,18.2529,1.5816,2.0602,0.1509,0.3323,1.4281,1.0863,5.3587,4.1807,0.3492,4.1432,3.297,3.1208,3.2647,1.1615,2.7256,3.3523,2.2306,1.5597,0.0304,17.3713,9.3204,6.428,2.7471,2.2532,3.6105,4.849,2.4143,2.4023,0.1243,5.6074,0.7449,0.0147,1.5933,3.6317,1.1031,0.1099,0.0004,0.0016,0.539,4.737,2.6383,3.0613,3.4528,3.4194,1.3689,2.8009,1.931,1.7681,7.4703,1.3734,4.2398,2.5814,4.0052,0.0984,1.4921,4.9859,8.6144,0.3828,0.2096,5.667,2.881,2.2584,5.4253,1.1845,2.359,7.718,3.6572,2.7698,0.0108,0.1485,6.7061,0.3186,0.2792,6.989,4.4777,1.2478,2.0468,4.3991,0.8197,1.9009,3.3341,5.1925,0.0186,5.7336,0.0437,0.0188,7.9975,6.3844,0.842,5.4881,0.0004,0.004,0.0166,0.3383,2.0453,2.1527,1.6553,3.9851,5.7401,0.1045,6.5229,1.8512,13.7634,0.8784,0.9559,2.9369,9.1236,3.7897,5.0994,0.7349,3.8064,6.4511,8.1098,5.2166,0.9589,2.2908,9.7332,6.3819,14.5853,4.2386,4.3451,0.0085,3.0842,7.6213,7.4189,1.0938,4.6805,4.7122,2.2751,0.9988,6.6551,0.3648,7.78,3.3598,1.8589,3.359,2.8877,3.8147,0.0675,3.6599,0.7099,2.7755,2.2731,3.7574,4.4105,1.25,4.1675,0.2476,4.5185,4.3556,1.23,2.8785,3.0525,5.0291,1.1069,4.65,2.1537,0.6177,0.1671,0.1246,6.4848,2.7478,0.5139,0.22,7.6687,4.7336,0.7536,4.1405,7.542,15.4938,2.4917,5.7729,4.3457,3.6718,1.1967,1.5568,4.7179,0.0028,3.5027,5.3449,0.0634,2.5738,2.0759,0.0103,4.6087,1.2242,2.5053,0.4531,4.1654,3.8895,0.6268,0.4332,2.5083,7.5142,0.2306,7.5107,1.7178,1.3951,0.1895,4.5647,1.0982,4.7054,0.533,4.0383,2.3623,1.5401,1.7557,2.1607,2.8414,0.3266,2.8344,2.2264,2.8578,0.259,3.0081,0.4982,3.3235,4.1188,3.5809,6.2217,2.4911,5.9985,0.5132,4.7358,2.6096,2.8725,0.0767,5.4238,0.8166,5.5671,4.7895,1.6259,5.0071,1.9236,4.028,0.2348,10.309,0.7774,1.6454,1.7963,1.7178,1.4929,2.3983,2.5273,0.0035,4.3362,2.2354,2.7053,1.1334,2.4958,4.5681,2.018,4.3532,2.5981,5.5319,3.2382,0.7985,3.0887,2.0734,0.0171,0.4153,0.3232,2.3671,5.9121,6.1007,0.3942,2.5724,0.7042,1.7547,3.3165,6.1271,3.0212,6.8319,1.445,6.1763,2.2834,1.7223,5.417,0.1968,0.8592,1.6824,5.6391,0.4612,1.5307,0.9403,5.2438,3.0866,2.2706,0.1371,0.0083,8.689,1.6231,3.0388,6.9437,1.2269,8.0946,5.7521,0.7963,1.253,2.4071,4.6712,5.6375,1.7753,6.1193,0.0005,2.4479,3.9013,2.3424,0.0351,1.9336,7.5355,1.8712,2.0063,2.902,1.9254,3.8681,0.0018,10.4292,0.2163,2.0381,0.581,0.0552,1.2874,1.576,0.3859,5.6992,4.7614,1.9173,2.5045,0.2612,6.0818,1.4808,4.7602,1.0652,4.842,2.9276,6.5411,4.216,1.3086,0.7006,6.758,0.8512,1.8923,5.5245,4.4264,0.7795,2.9975,8.2058,0.8662,0.7983,2.6233,0.9902,4.826,6.9872,0.3171,1.7695,2.9338,0.9789,1.983,3.5871,4.1073,5.7097,1.5381,1.5583,4.9615,6.8711,4.0153,6.3615,1.3327,0.8348,1.0872,5.8134,3.1497,0.7218,7.0893,0.1548,2.3781,0.0672,0.9284,4.9944,0.0417,1.0011,8.459,0.0,0.0054,0.5524,1.923,4.6539,1.7346,5.1505,5.066,2.5689,0.4195,3.2538,3.7626,0.0037,0.8995,0.2394,1.2255,2.011,6.8144,0.6536,4.917,0.3637,0.2042,0.5857,2.0805,3.8468,0.0585,1.6659,0.9009,1.0129]}

Moore, a former high school math teacher who has been accused of sexual misconduct several times, was challenged by Democrat Doug Jones in the special election.\nFormer GOP congressman Jeff Hawley called for the Senate to investigate the possibility that President Donald Trump may have committed a crime. Hawley has said he believes Trump should be impeached after the video surfaced Monday night, in which he encouraged rioters to storm the U.S. Capitol. In a new column Monday, Hawley called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2019 s office to request that House investigators begin an impeachment inquiry.\nOn the day that the Senate begins its impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, a group of Democrats who are critical of the president and have worked to undermine his administration have announced they will leave the party. The group came together on Twitter late Sunday night and told its followers not to back Mr. Trump. \u201cThey\u2019re all a pack of morons, \u201d wrote California Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand on the social network. The group includes Sens. Jeff Merkley and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sheldon Whitehouse \u2026\nOn Tuesday evening, the Senate confirmed the six nominees it selected for key posts in President Joe Biden \u2019 s Cabinet., including Secretary of Agriculture and U.S. Trade Representative. But he added \u201cthat we need to be mindful that these confirmations will be a matter of some controversy, and that some of these individuals in their nomination hearings have come under fire, even at the hands of President Trump. \u201d\nAfter Republicans accused the FBI of politicizing the investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, the head of the agency testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

U.S. officials said Iran supplied the missile and claimed it was in a \"special-use\" flight zone.\nIran and Saudi Arabia are locked in a bitter showdown over Tehran's support for Houthi rebels in Yemen who the Saudi crown prince has supported to take over more than half Yemen in the name of removing President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi from power.\nHaley, who served as U.S. ambassador in Russia while her husband, Donald Trump, served as president, accused Iran of supplying weapons to the Huthis in an article earlier this month.\nShe said a senior Iranian officer said Tehran supplied the missile, which had the capacity to hit a city in Saudi Arabia, through Jordan and Kuwait and used the flight zone as a base to launch operations.\nEarlier this week, in the wake of the missile attack, Trump announced new sanctions on Iran that would have restricted Iran's oil exports, effectively rendering the country impoverished.\nThe U.S. move came days after Trump met in Kuwait with Saudi crown prince Mohammad bin Salman, after which the U.S. embassy in Saudi Arabia had reported that an American flag had been raised on a foreign military base on the kingdom's southern border with Yemen.","token_len":456,"entropy":[10.3582,5.0379,4.4177,2.9004,4.6179,0.0328,0.4021,0.0624,4.8525,4.5863,2.1757,0.2338,2.3084,6.471,3.5079,3.4855,5.205,3.0624,5.5177,0.0806,5.2577,1.3881,3.7795,4.4067,0.0133,3.0724,1.4024,8.5919,12.7707,8.6468,1.3348,3.9266,0.0003,0.0184,0.2188,8.5749,0.189,0.1919,0.2517,0.0072,0.3997,0.0001,0.2494,2.9951,0.8835,4.0583,0.1827,0.1201,4.5917,0.3375,0.1885,23.9255,1.7347,1.8286,0.5971,6.2139,2.7188,0.4326,2.7,0.2271,2.6847,5.0377,0.0323,5.3049,1.3999,1.6073,1.7964,1.1458,0.0003,0.043,0.0559,4.216,0.0953,2.7151,1.6198,1.5894,7.2446,0.4292,1.8807,7.1144,0.1586,0.0124,4.0976,1.1577,3.6322,3.9709,1.5019,7.5548,0.5996,0.428,1.4236,0.6974,0.1987,12.9833,1.5609,0.0003,0.0792,0.1144,8.4095,0.8389,0.1713,1.1412,0.0909,2.1071,2.6828,1.6052,0.4298,1.5575,2.0545,3.4572,3.3823,0.1243,0.0014,0.0319,5.6214,1.9145,0.22,1.3574,2.7584,6.0052,0.1215,2.3403,5.8638,0.1301,3.0973,3.5094,0.253,6.6923,0.5867,1.3214,0.9548,0.0577,1.3753,2.8073,5.6252,0.5277,2.4809,0.3067,0.2899,0.2649,0.0021,0.0002,0.0002,0.0001,0.6129,3.4272,2.587,5.7292,4.5241,5.2828,2.0568,2.7265,1.645,3.4278,3.2141,1.8128,2.8276,5.9336,1.1028,2.2167,4.2952,6.3016,2.0577,3.5313,5.8832,0.0188,1.26,0.2224,3.0099,0.0028,5.6872,2.111,2.0888,5.9213,5.6774,1.0575,0.3483,4.2314,1.31,2.6448,2.3451,5.5328,0.4052,2.8214,4.0906,2.9854,1.1724,1.4352,3.4387,1.3829,1.3829,5.4944,4.433,1.4167,7.3481,1.5426,1.842,0.895,3.4741,3.9975,1.6707,5.2453,0.9137,4.4252,1.0608,3.7125,1.5033,5.2446,0.0004,0.0381,0.0183,0.7475,1.2331,4.6532,5.4922,0.374,0.3482,2.7671,4.8067,0.7613,0.3943,4.4734,3.451,2.2497,4.9421,5.081,4.0611,1.96,5.9358,5.4856,0.9718,0.2658,3.4467,4.2071,1.1635,0.1129,2.5829,4.3524,0.0299,0.323,2.5254,5.904,0.2023,3.3668,0.0271,4.228,0.3091,2.5948,0.0183,0.1083,1.1109,0.0273,2.4599,4.9679,3.1559,7.4144,0.698,1.4358,4.0258,4.5521,4.5642,2.0429,5.585,0.7115,1.4636,4.7222,5.1709,1.7952,5.7005,0.0016,6.2334,1.8119,0.4935,0.4003,0.0422,0.0003,1.2984,0.0007,0.0,1.1391,0.0182,0.2395,0.5946,2.4756,0.7735,2.3055,0.9472,4.1088,0.2962,1.913,0.0004,0.0986,0.0038,0.2632,3.0116,9.3272,6.9179,3.2766,1.6231,1.9246,5.4006,0.1666,0.1502,2.464,0.1247,3.1331,0.4877,4.4753,1.502,0.1303,3.5864,1.9033,0.3645,1.3075,7.3287,2.7709,1.1306,1.8607,2.3341,4.3821,7.066,0.0654,0.9123,1.7573,0.6315,3.4271,1.4122,4.4803,4.1994,2.0122,4.8943,3.178,4.7014,3.4966,1.0983,0.5533,1.9197,1.028,3.4183,4.3094,4.359,0.0721,1.3821,2.0486,4.8357,1.0061,3.0847,0.0866,1.4854,6.0446,7.6682,1.423,4.0661,2.791,4.953,2.2987,5.9454,1.3276,1.3581,0.3904,2.2318,1.7914,1.1942,7.4544,1.1655,0.4164,6.3104,1.1145,1.3139,0.2014,5.3275,3.3776,2.284,0.0006,1.2538,2.7261,1.0333,0.5393,3.5893,4.538,4.7667,0.1861,1.1814,0.6123,2.4095,1.2739,3.3061,5.0414,3.2691,0.1008,3.7479,0.5189,2.2153,5.0306,6.927,1.1787,1.0582,8.394,0.8707,0.4778,2.1122,1.703,0.0004,0.0287,0.0724,7.6946,2.3818,3.2761,0.0735,2.6592,4.579,4.5132,5.5544,0.2747,1.4287,6.2152,0.0329,3.5491,0.0734,0.0645,0.7744,6.4376,1.4485,1.564,2.2095,0.0004,0.0038,0.0305,4.6637,0.4097,3.3911,0.0098,4.7114,4.9354,0.9894,4.2011,2.9346,6.4722,0.9053,0.2371,2.9763,2.0689,2.0104,4.994,3.15,0.2366,4.0696,0.4722,3.7395,0.0193,1.7945,1.2629,1.5592,1.4894,0.2686]}

Charles Duchaine","text":"Two French ministers said on Tuesday they had no immediate plans to overhaul legislation to make it easier to target corrupt foreign firms - a change demanded by their own anti-graft agency. Charles Duchaine, the interior minister, and Edouard Balladur, the commerce minister and treasury secretary who signed the law that created the anticorruption agency in 2005, did not immediately rule out changes but said they were \"not at the top of my minds\". The head of France's foreign ministry, Bernard Kouchner, and the head of his finance ministry counterpart, Christine Lagarde, were among the European Union countries that have expressed concerns about the lack of enforcement capabilities under the existing law. They have said some of the agency's investigations into French companies are hampered by an ambiguous jurisdiction on where companies' home offices can be. Asked if Paris would change its laws to better target the country's foreign firms, Mr Duchaine said: \"We want to protect them. We don't want to say too much but we want to strengthen the fight because there is a need. We want to do what is necessary.\" Mr Duchaine said he had met Mr Balladur and Mr Lagarde to discuss the matter and he noted that Mr Kouchner was in Brussels, where he said that other European Union countries were in the same position. \"The question will be raised at an official meeting but, beyond some minor modifications, there is not really anything to be done at that stage, apart from a request for additional resources from the European Commission,\" he said. \"The first priority, I say this knowing the difficulties, is to get the budget of the agency up,\" Mr Duchaine told reporters at the ministry. He noted that the agency's annual bill was about 3 billion euro (S$4.83 billion) and that it was working to raise some of that through more transparency. Mr Balladur said the law had already been tested, and that while it had helped to raise corruption suspicions about some companies and individuals, more work needed to be done.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on March 29, 2016, with the headline 'France to tackle foreign graft?

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was willing to shut down the government to get funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall , complicating two must-pass measures Congress will take up in September : a","text":"President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was willing to shut down the government to get funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, complicating two must-pass measures Congress will take up in September : a defense authorization bill and a spending bill.\nAsked during an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" whether he would shut down the government to fund his border barrier, Trump answered, \"Absolutely.\"\nThe president's suggestion sparked criticism from Democratic members of Congress who have said the wall is not the primary point in the spending bill. Other Republicans in Congress also said they wouldn't support the plan.\nIf he were to shut down the government or invoke a threat of war, a key provision authorizing a borrowing authorization could be suspended, a Treasury official said.\nIf there is a shutdown, the government could shut down for two weeks, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\nTrump's announcement came as Republicans in Congress wrapped up the legislative year with a marathon of votes on bills. The next items to go before lawmakers come from health-care, tax, foreign aid and infrastructure.\n\"The most essential parts of the government are going to work and will continue to function,\" Trump told reporters in the White House. \"There'll be people in all parts of the government who will be very unhappy. They won't do their job, and we know that.\"\nThe president has said that in the Senate, his Republican allies in the upper chamber \"won't move\" an appropriations measure to fund the wall.\nTrump's comments on shutting down the government come just hours before a government shutdown deadline, at which time a partial government shutdown could be in effect if no budget deal is reached.\nAt least 15.5 million American workers pay their federal taxes through payroll deductions from wages, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Those employees, usually called employees with payroll deductions of their taxes, are subject to additional taxes or penalties.\nThe American Federation of Government Employees in its annual report on its members said the current law imposes a penalty tax on nearly 14.3 million employees, including 7.8 million with a payroll deduction for their taxes and the rest eligible for full tax exemption. About 5.9 million of those are subject to the penalty tax.","token_len":457,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,3.4669,1.8901,2.2773,2.0877,2.0856,3.8805,0.0096,8.4742,0.0603,0.5547,1.8881,3.2671,3.3511,5.0477,0.4362,2.2186,6.456,0.0037,0.0273,1.1671,1.6549,0.089,0.0162,1.8618,10.2175,0.0206,7.6381,11.1861,0.0278,0.6431,5.1401,5.2139,4.1938,2.3492,4.2927,2.0488,3.7923,11.6775,2.0916,6.7119,1.0869,0.6185,0.9692,0.8108,2.7717,0.2652,0.4307,0.4099,20.5173,4.5952,1.4798,0.5149,0.651,3.5694,1.6001,0.0206,0.3212,0.0,0.0063,0.0733,1.3871,0.5731,1.2449,3.6956,0.1242,0.2933,0.1348,1.8455,2.9034,2.9753,1.0252,8.5197,0.5902,0.3299,4.2715,1.0632,0.0467,3.4413,0.8947,0.2081,12.4445,1.463,1.8561,5.8075,6.0164,3.6067,0.3594,4.2185,4.3697,0.051,0.2589,1.6365,2.0096,2.137,1.5572,2.3518,1.6743,2.461,4.0605,6.3426,6.6204,2.9772,1.135,4.3345,0.2294,0.7888,6.6061,1.8771,3.9366,0.5516,3.4112,2.2152,1.433,3.9613,0.0007,1.3158,0.9503,3.7912,0.909,0.1116,13.3882,4.1259,2.0207,0.3276,2.4252,0.1128,0.2604,0.0943,5.2157,7.8187,1.4362,8.288,0.6342,3.2302,0.543,4.778,5.6853,2.8681,9.2508,3.1037,9.8087,4.5795,2.4483,1.0595,4.9306,1.6472,3.2803,5.711,1.2387,0.2916,0.3814,0.3926,5.2551,5.0169,1.121,0.9868,2.657,0.4909,1.2539,1.7822,1.8875,3.1551,0.0823,1.7726,2.7918,1.1299,1.3912,1.6593,0.0551,5.017,2.3074,0.0463,0.1889,0.0038,0.0014,0.4838,0.1182,0.1575,0.5128,2.3114,1.5077,3.9981,2.0168,1.7886,3.4376,1.7045,0.4449,8.6336,0.043,2.111,3.6461,5.3331,2.5522,0.6678,5.8933,4.3291,3.5009,0.9067,4.5079,3.0918,2.2395,4.5752,8.9722,2.3929,2.0484,0.6861,2.6849,5.8505,5.4766,6.6078,3.65,0.0425,0.9533,2.5457,1.3131,5.3459,2.6344,0.5495,2.8757,2.6757,0.3179,7.6657,2.3104,5.2625,6.6129,4.1075,0.093,1.0565,3.1584,1.3102,2.6019,0.1184,5.5096,2.763,3.6507,1.7511,0.1505,3.3541,1.088,3.3134,2.2237,0.6584,2.1055,2.5872,1.8887,0.0015,2.4347,1.037,3.7377,5.3775,0.0733,5.0436,2.9218,5.1308,2.749,0.0619,0.4867,0.8444,0.8774,1.1525,1.2338,3.3459,3.9788,2.0678,2.3643,2.5909,0.0006,4.7267,1.9663,1.9419,1.9609,1.2906,2.5229,5.5927,0.7944,1.1071,0.0733,4.9424,1.808,2.36,1.5761,2.652,5.3759,1.0681,5.3884,0.6488,3.5202,5.0736,4.0956,2.5166,0.5587,4.5415,0.0097,4.425,2.7246,0.0293,5.3258,2.4023,7.5604,2.0681,3.4652,1.6566,1.8723,0.5813,1.3272,0.7331,0.9694,2.5794,1.3014,2.5247,2.7347,6.6842,0.1302,0.1587,0.0519,2.4564,3.3469,2.7568,1.5335,2.1619,5.4677,0.5656,4.6614,2.7398,4.6805,0.4982,0.8846,3.3688,5.5447,0.7488,0.3342,1.9918,1.6888,4.0727,0.8878,4.8563,3.676,4.055,1.5643,0.3552,0.1128,0.5698,0.4933,4.5155,2.4459,4.7132,8.0099,1.2549,0.0543,3.9373,2.2533,8.3041,2.888,1.5971,1.839,2.5294,2.1374,1.0947,5.8164,3.7304,1.5162,2.27,0.001,0.5066,2.6707,0.0357,0.0001,0.4311,4.3736,3.3819,2.7175,5.6222,4.1279,4.9879,3.8811,4.6097,0.4272,1.6877,7.1271,9.0842,0.2015,1.6345,4.0561,0.0022,5.449,1.8936,5.3131,2.1491,1.5721,0.3722,1.9616,5.0426,1.7634,0.0107,1.1123,0.0024,5.066,3.807,0.8798,0.8996,1.8162,4.0403,3.5722,0.6573,1.8168,4.1567,3.9345,4.5393,1.0571,3.957,8.5134,0.5295,4.9475,5.236,2.7589,2.4452,0.1826,2.8199,1.7425,2.2572,4.9287,0.4006,2.2517,0.0392,2.8608,3.4026,2.2541,0.1485,4.9724,2.4177,1.8587,2.8071,4.47,2.3116,7.3488,0.2244,6.7342,5.1041,6.2736,0.4649,5.2273,3.412,0.6537,2.6656,0.0152,1.3995,0.4331,3.4301,4.0132,0.0022,2.0044,1.2063,1.3449,0.7953]}

However, the president is also not willing to extend the deadline for Congress to address President Obama\u2019s healthcare proposal on a weekend.\nThere was also talk in conference room that the president may come to Washington to address lawmakers from the Senate and House together.\nThe president\u2019s administration did not give details about what would happen next, but has indicated it would wait for Republican leaders to address the possibility of a government shutdown before it would respond.

Ms. Gingrich was nominated by President Donald Trump in July, days after U.S. Catholic bishops criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown and called for religious immigrants. \u201cUnder your leadership, the embassy in the Holy See will continue to support our Catholic brothers and sisters in many countries around the world,\u201d she said in a statement.

{"prompt":"Republicans plan to release the language of their tax legislation early Thursday morning , the head of the U.S. House Budget Committee told Bloomberg TV in an interview on Wednesday . \u201c That is going","text":"Republicans plan to release the language of their tax legislation early Thursday morning, the head of the U.S. House Budget Committee told Bloomberg TV in an interview on Wednesday. \u201c That is going to be the one that the media gets at 5:00 or 6:00,\u201d Kevin Brady told a question on whether he expected the full proposal for the current budget to be available at a later time.\nBrady also said that members and staff at the committee in the morning of Thursday would work with the White House and Treasury Department toward drafting the final version of the legislation. He said officials were \u201cjust getting started, with work, meetings and phone calls \u201d on the legislation.\nIn its most extensive public disclosure of plans for a new law since it was told last year that Congress would have to approve a spending plan before Oct. 1, the White House has laid out a number of initiatives and policies that it hopes the legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act will support, along with legislation that would be added. On top of that, President Trump has said he wants to raise taxes.\nIn one of his most controversial statements on the health law, Trump said he would \u201creplace the federal health care law.\u201d He said he wanted to do so \u201clike that\u201d \u2013 by eliminating the ACA altogether and imposing what he calls a \u201csingle-payer\u201d health care system in its place.\nThe White House and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have already announced health care reform. They have said they will be eliminating the individual mandates of the law, which give patients the option of joining Medicaid or signing up for private insurance. It has become increasingly clear that the goal of the new law is to achieve the goal of a single-payer national healthcare system, which is a much more radical than the so-called mandate, in which the government would provide health insurance.\nThe Trump administration and Senate Democrats have been engaged in a series of discussions about the language of the bill to replace the ACA through the end of week.

{"prompt":"Norway s Liberal Party will launch formal negotiations to join the right-wing cabinet of Prime Minister Erna Solberg , it said on Saturday , although the government would still be ruling in a minority even","text":"Norway s Liberal Party will launch formal negotiations to join the right-wing cabinet of Prime Minister Erna Solberg, it said on Saturday, although the government would still be ruling in a minority even with the expected support.\n\"The Liberal Party wants this coalition to have strong economic policies focusing on growing job and incomes for the people. It wants to give the welfare state a thorough overhaul to make it more fair and more effective. It wants to reduce the budget deficit and to make sure that Norway is on track to achieve the goals set by the UN, international organizations and the European Union,\" Lene Hjerte, a Liberal Party spokesperson, said in a statement.\nThe ruling Liberal Democrats -which is a coalition partner with a left-wing radical opposition alliance, called Progress in Norway-Rain - were elected earlier this year to a narrow majority.\nTheir victory came on the back of a strong run by Solberg and has since seen the government deal with increasingly hardline economic reforms aimed at revamping the welfare state and fighting austerity. While it has been an open secret that the Conservatives and the Christian Democrats -which had ruled Norway in coalition for most of the previous century- were willing to support Solberg's reforms, there is a consensus that the ruling party is now eager to push through the measures, especially after the failure of the government s former strategy of attempting to reduce the country's budget deficit to below 6 percent by 2015.\nThe Liberal Democrats may have no formal talks to reach an agreement, but the government is expected to announce that it will give formal support to the Solberg government if it is not able to do so alone. Hjerte s remarks on the Liberal Party s willingness to join negotiations was the first time in months that any public announcement from the party has been made and it came just as Prime Minister Erna Solberg left Washington for Oslo.\nShe has spoken out publicly in support of a reform of the welfare state, which is a subject taboo at the center-left, but is understood in the capital to want to avoid a government crisis. She is eager to find a path that would allow her to gain parliamentary support in the country s second-largest party, the Social Democrats, which has shown little willingness to support the government to date.","token_len":459,"entropy":[8.4603,9.4514,12.8809,1.4304,4.2186,5.1391,7.0908,2.7926,2.3587,4.5896,0.6868,6.8199,0.3541,0.1317,7.966,3.0968,1.7344,0.001,4.2785,0.1501,0.0137,0.0017,1.6885,5.6009,2.3893,1.3122,2.483,2.3184,5.1584,1.7186,3.2491,3.1457,4.0904,2.4534,7.6094,4.9407,2.2819,3.0113,9.0292,2.9151,1.247,6.338,2.9461,4.8738,0.2315,11.4282,1.4106,2.4066,0.5576,4.7876,5.7002,4.349,0.7446,3.453,4.068,3.6495,2.6722,8.761,0.0584,5.4225,5.3744,4.2153,5.2821,1.9767,2.052,3.2035,3.0249,1.9899,1.72,0.7212,4.4412,2.0296,6.1295,0.4183,0.8922,6.9381,1.0154,2.7667,2.2836,0.3681,1.3576,2.8696,0.9518,3.1358,2.9841,1.9672,1.3518,0.6842,0.5034,4.128,1.3361,4.3092,0.0864,1.3247,2.9345,2.6479,1.7529,1.0762,6.08,1.504,3.8648,1.654,0.4015,2.7957,2.4395,3.1027,1.7688,0.9308,0.4774,3.86,3.7965,5.0156,3.3155,0.3706,1.0004,2.0796,0.3555,0.7256,5.7436,8.4196,4.0857,6.5971,5.7285,0.8546,1.8368,2.5575,0.796,2.5646,0.1985,0.5692,0.5956,0.2678,0.1302,0.196,0.1476,1.6271,5.7271,3.3938,1.4778,6.0356,7.9771,2.8472,3.6113,1.9706,2.8942,1.1113,4.6426,3.7845,0.0818,0.4397,6.6779,3.7047,5.1837,2.4649,5.3052,4.3174,3.862,1.3494,5.8367,17.1198,7.5364,3.7137,4.2646,5.234,0.2676,0.8919,2.14,2.3855,7.7562,1.6178,2.0067,0.8866,4.7843,4.7853,2.8548,3.4065,0.3665,1.0043,0.001,1.0641,3.3465,6.1933,0.7402,5.0928,0.0015,1.9187,6.7622,4.2565,3.445,1.4559,2.9811,6.123,0.3311,7.7627,3.0947,0.4813,4.7534,3.7658,4.181,0.0083,5.0862,3.751,0.7307,1.9666,0.3534,1.9397,5.7447,4.2199,0.5525,6.5919,3.5499,1.6895,1.8539,4.6585,3.8876,2.233,0.3136,0.6953,4.4338,2.929,1.6854,5.6716,0.1977,4.3858,2.7849,3.6754,4.962,1.4955,2.5729,3.8846,1.7219,4.5879,0.0048,0.2868,2.8163,5.1908,3.6188,2.7322,5.5347,0.0346,2.5669,4.1485,0.0025,0.9844,4.267,1.2175,3.9595,1.587,2.8159,4.8763,1.4068,1.1235,5.2326,0.7343,1.9042,3.6511,6.3383,0.0606,4.2408,1.615,1.7411,4.2445,3.0061,3.7219,2.9708,1.1384,5.0047,0.2529,1.019,3.7448,10.1533,8.0537,9.2175,1.2128,6.2576,0.0368,3.7524,0.8611,3.8262,0.0458,1.8405,0.0526,2.7003,3.4159,3.9008,0.7287,3.3491,2.2709,0.3803,0.2214,1.6298,3.2606,0.6217,5.6714,1.6668,5.2102,6.5891,4.4123,2.4706,4.9044,0.9926,0.0429,1.8043,0.6123,1.9943,2.1316,1.6084,1.5691,0.0111,2.6239,3.9712,0.6507,0.4822,5.1378,4.5387,2.4588,0.3235,0.5543,10.6776,0.0097,1.0808,3.0466,0.6947,1.9205,3.4608,1.7013,0.0146,3.7012,0.0558,9.5701,0.4064,6.3195,0.0248,0.0025,10.3448,6.7102,4.0171,0.8238,4.0888,2.2012,3.8314,6.3921,0.042,2.8534,6.3054,5.0214,3.4103,0.8276,1.6754,3.4971,3.947,0.1954,4.6027,6.3805,3.763,3.4596,0.3284,1.438,1.6034,0.5531,0.288,5.0768,2.4424,2.9501,2.4523,2.5486,3.5786,0.0011,0.9317,0.0007,0.0326,0.0005,5.7366,6.6421,1.1237,4.4917,1.0857,0.4431,4.5912,3.186,5.7563,1.3281,3.4795,2.5281,1.5369,0.0217,3.4613,4.0982,1.4897,0.5547,0.6059,0.3807,1.5741,2.0993,2.4825,3.4199,5.2022,9.1504,3.5137,0.7516,2.7305,5.3888,0.9534,3.687,1.5658,3.6352,5.4765,5.8491,1.3535,6.7401,0.3848,5.6995,0.6437,3.81,1.7401,2.7844,7.0569,0.9443,3.1324,2.3771,7.1124,0.1408,4.7623,0.6897,5.5973,3.0506,2.2995,1.8152,0.8839,0.6003,4.8322,4.011,0.6401,2.4152,0.9582,3.9355,3.0481,4.3772,1.5424,0.3586,2.4591,1.0891,0.6284,1.3101,0.2219,0.563,1.2856,1.4106,5.9075,1.8909,3.3119,0.0592,2.2132,1.3992,1.9424,5.3899,2.2425,0.2633]}

I once again condemn","text":"French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday he was counting on U.N. Security Council members China and Russia to step up sanctions on North Korea after its latest missile test. I once again condemn North Korea\u2019s provocative launch of a missile that flew over Japan on Saturday. The missile went over Japan\u2019s southern islands. I believe I am right in saying that it flew over Japan\u2019s southern islands and went into the Pacific Ocean. As the President said: \u2018When I speak I condemn the provocation. We have spoken in the Security Council. I think we said what we had to say.\u2019\u201d\nA U.N. Security Council vote on draft sanctions against North Korea is set for Friday. There are concerns the planned move will result in further stalemate, as one government official asked for the vote to be delayed after an attempt last week failed to garner a majority. On Monday, the vote was called without a quorum and it will be moved a week and a half later.\nThe North\u2019s failure to halt nuclear and ballistic missile activities and its nuclear program continues to drive tensions in Asia, while its refusal to return to the Six-Party Talks \u2013 a joint Security Council and North Korean government initiative aimed at achieving denuclearization \u2013 has led to increased isolation. Trump has tried to steer North Korea toward diplomacy, but it seems to be having little effect.\nMeanwhile, Kim Jong Un\u2019s wife visited Russia today. In a news conference with President Vladimir Putin, North Korean state TV quoted Kim\u2019s wife saying that her husband \u201cis an energetic and strong leader and would do whatever he can in his power\u201d and that \u201che will surely help in resolving the long-running nuclear issue.\u201d\nThe U.S. State Department is preparing to announce the sanctions on Friday, and hopes for a deal on a phasing-out of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and lifting international sanctions will be reflected in them. This is to be determined by its review of North Korea\u2019s previous nuclear and ballistic missile tests, as well as its participation and efforts to join global initiatives to end U.S. embargoes and promote nuclear disarmament, U.S. government sources said.","token_len":459,"entropy":[7.6511,4.3085,0.0027,3.0306,1.7284,2.2785,1.9869,1.567,8.743,0.0839,5.9902,0.002,2.5218,0.0444,2.1691,0.0021,3.0002,7.9296,0.3833,0.2083,0.2094,4.1856,0.1742,3.1384,1.1614,1.7025,0.0686,3.6835,3.3499,0.7019,1.4676,0.2551,0.4038,10.1177,8.8486,1.915,4.9794,2.2457,0.0977,13.7722,8.2976,6.2036,2.6435,4.4223,1.1966,0.462,1.5051,1.7164,1.8247,0.667,1.3285,2.1371,2.6489,0.8172,3.2531,4.4012,5.2185,2.3169,1.0109,8.7624,0.3789,0.0118,3.1148,3.3878,1.5693,2.5079,4.4044,5.131,2.3024,4.5378,3.1903,1.0625,0.6968,3.6128,8.4606,0.2976,0.415,1.6985,0.0022,0.0115,1.2332,0.3192,2.2079,6.2322,3.4921,0.9731,2.95,1.3942,0.7031,4.5847,2.921,2.7262,1.5379,3.1988,4.7749,5.7511,6.3677,2.855,3.2599,4.5564,6.789,1.8149,3.7434,1.8623,2.5736,2.2021,5.8557,3.2627,1.304,5.4895,0.0083,1.486,2.0561,3.0943,1.2712,7.6943,3.8205,0.2428,2.8184,0.1942,0.1434,1.1755,5.6935,0.1326,2.6202,7.2496,2.015,9.3134,3.115,0.0013,0.5909,0.0427,1.7735,0.0015,2.2325,0.6146,8.5246,1.4766,2.5139,0.0918,0.0195,1.9279,2.2653,0.3868,2.5945,0.736,5.0327,1.2178,4.208,3.0161,8.1604,4.453,2.333,4.8436,0.0029,2.374,9.527,0.0352,2.1428,2.2251,6.2846,8.2805,1.3711,6.249,1.9486,2.2961,0.9109,0.8968,0.8999,2.2014,5.089,4.3165,4.5714,4.7867,0.5589,2.983,1.3737,4.5132,2.1312,1.3273,0.7739,5.1607,2.3647,0.2317,1.5589,5.4162,0.6091,3.2007,4.8329,1.6784,6.6084,0.0065,2.2887,3.5643,3.5847,1.2881,4.7484,6.9532,2.4981,6.0318,0.0672,0.0177,0.3441,0.4513,0.7329,1.9298,3.1893,13.8159,0.0949,0.014,8.966,0.1423,4.2957,5.3831,1.1136,2.084,0.0614,3.178,3.2353,1.5749,3.3484,2.7308,6.1109,0.3993,4.727,1.9234,1.5819,3.3008,1.351,4.4658,4.2118,6.4885,0.0212,6.4619,0.2487,0.8444,7.6046,0.7465,0.007,0.0165,6.1334,1.892,5.5276,5.9009,0.0022,4.72,4.4267,0.5333,4.1595,4.1474,2.7751,0.0213,4.6212,3.3379,0.0002,0.0697,0.9694,1.4865,2.405,0.3352,3.469,5.4378,2.2454,5.9126,1.3486,5.3961,0.1361,6.3013,3.2105,0.1228,1.9352,5.0443,1.3819,1.216,2.5662,3.5504,2.1599,1.12,3.9925,1.9615,0.3168,0.5987,0.9478,5.0381,0.0959,4.7928,0.2406,0.2989,4.2937,0.0788,0.1892,5.6492,7.5341,4.3903,3.6609,2.1284,3.8227,0.9951,5.3279,0.1094,2.2971,3.2738,0.2955,0.0052,0.2983,4.8939,1.0058,5.3181,3.9834,4.1284,1.1693,7.6157,0.0092,0.0076,1.4883,2.3236,1.4806,2.7938,0.6051,7.3242,4.4041,2.7361,4.9328,6.4327,1.4858,3.4743,0.6793,2.0965,4.378,3.1288,2.1674,2.4759,0.6739,4.1278,1.8969,1.1961,5.4331,7.0,2.9013,1.1391,7.2323,1.0585,1.11,1.4356,8.0335,4.3539,3.3871,4.4006,0.462,6.2656,0.2157,0.7762,3.5083,1.2917,0.9535,6.9869,2.2082,0.5477,2.2383,2.4907,0.001,0.5663,0.2662,2.1489,0.0083,3.3093,4.226,0.6795,3.3163,2.7699,4.4619,2.2951,4.8917,1.1443,2.3724,7.6737,4.1903,1.1349,3.7925,2.2889,2.6651,9.1802,0.1298,1.8712,0.0851,0.2732,2.1439,0.2175,4.8053,0.0787,0.0514,1.183,0.4957,3.5139,4.4774,4.8605,0.2588,3.9694,1.0855,6.6425,0.264,7.2432,0.4638,4.2417,1.7128,4.8438,1.3404,5.8144,0.8959,6.3258,7.68,0.4215,2.4952,0.2205,1.7742,0.0167,0.0059,6.3494,1.5839,1.3293,1.4425,0.0652,0.8911,1.3138,1.9072,0.0545,0.0078,1.4743,6.3447,5.5593,5.3273,0.7078,7.0453,6.2329,5.1011,0.9137,3.1579,5.5689,0.0006,0.0802,0.8146,11.532,0.0007,0.0168,3.1034,4.4332,4.8524,0.8801,0.0003,3.4031,5.2478,0.0015,0.6191,0.1824,4.2979,2.4323,0.9726,0.281]}
{"prompt":"The Trump administration may abandon its promise to repeal the U.S. estate tax on inherited assets in an effort to make a still-evolving Republican tax cut framework more politically feasible , according to sources familiar","text":"The Trump administration may abandon its promise to repeal the U.S. estate tax on inherited assets in an effort to make a still-evolving Republican tax cut framework more politically feasible, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is leading the effort to scrap the estate tax. Grassley's efforts echoed earlier calls to remove this tax on the part of Trump allies, including President-elect Joe Biden.\nThe new framework Biden is proposing to enact would slash the estate tax rate from its current rate of 39.6% to 30% but would not repeal the tax entirely. A source familiar with the negotiations said that Grassley and his fellow Republicans hope to bring the estate tax to death row with a plan to abolish it after an inheritance tax surcharge is phased in.\nA U.S. Senate version of the estate tax-repatriation strategy that would be used as the blueprint for a Biden tax plan is set to be introduced Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the issue. Repealing the estate tax is contingent on creating a surcharge of the estate tax on American estates. The estate tax surcharge is part of a broader plan to gradually slash the estate tax rate. The rate would be set at 30 percent through 2042, the source added.\nThe estate tax is a double-edged sword for the incoming administration, which would be making its first foray into U.S. estate tax law. Under the current law, the estates of U.S. residents owe property taxes on their estates and estate taxes on the return from the recipients of some inheritances. The U.S. Supreme Court recently threw an early roadblock for a Trump administration proposal to eliminate the tax on inheritances and property transfers.\nUnder the current law, the Federal Estate Tax Treaty applies to estates valued at $2.5 million or more and the transfer tax applies to estates valued at $11.2 million or more. However, the treaty applies only to assets held in or on American property, which includes banks, brokerages, and investment managers in an American jurisdiction. So a U.S. resident receiving an estate value in the $4 million-plus range would be subject to the gift tax.","token_len":459,"entropy":[7.6977,0.9163,3.9228,7.9005,1.1289,3.2479,0.1751,3.0795,1.8061,6.8205,0.0009,0.0031,0.0308,7.8605,0.0218,2.9207,5.7329,1.2922,3.2231,3.1813,0.368,0.0107,3.8954,4.4358,8.4395,0.5716,5.0602,0.0153,7.4882,1.8204,4.2956,9.9569,1.0949,4.9359,4.2819,1.4243,1.3802,0.0015,4.8317,0.6391,0.0013,0.1451,1.3224,0.0679,0.2128,23.7415,0.0736,3.8554,0.7988,1.2482,0.3529,0.0025,0.0009,0.0401,2.3175,0.0025,0.0271,0.2593,1.1071,0.0328,0.0942,3.4733,4.098,0.7297,1.235,0.3946,5.207,0.1922,1.1664,0.1107,1.5103,2.4473,2.2225,5.0169,8.6671,4.2661,1.8742,2.6346,5.0239,6.7076,0.726,2.5174,2.2489,7.5939,0.0019,2.2956,7.7802,1.5386,1.6284,5.0393,1.9758,0.0392,10.0942,0.9094,1.5113,0.2949,12.7635,4.3619,3.813,13.5619,2.0007,2.5881,3.6192,5.769,1.4452,5.8226,0.3908,1.1294,0.0213,1.7926,0.9681,6.7223,0.0403,2.5095,0.0375,2.4648,0.0197,0.0585,2.8519,0.0582,3.5202,1.4445,4.5822,1.6168,2.5956,2.5916,1.3385,1.3922,3.0162,0.4498,4.7371,4.4007,1.0088,0.0016,0.2096,4.104,0.8874,1.7642,3.325,2.6066,2.2648,3.5623,0.9237,5.1351,0.3056,4.4,1.2489,2.5607,0.0333,2.0141,9.4817,10.2549,4.3157,1.7395,4.5292,0.785,5.1473,0.1651,4.5832,5.1225,9.2682,0.4997,9.1089,0.3373,1.4624,4.0893,0.6674,0.9812,0.2299,4.2702,5.8679,0.001,0.005,0.004,1.9699,5.2321,0.0512,0.388,1.3832,0.0375,6.7088,8.996,1.4362,0.1514,6.7755,3.5632,2.7969,2.4354,4.2177,3.2348,1.5827,3.0713,0.1683,1.8934,9.7867,3.9371,2.5872,1.9561,3.4824,0.1164,0.7531,1.9971,4.7173,2.3935,2.196,0.0021,1.4434,1.1254,0.6321,0.0047,0.1195,4.9655,0.1318,9.861,0.3293,0.1981,0.6369,0.0261,2.406,7.1269,0.2559,6.059,0.6073,8.1488,0.8915,2.6595,4.3879,4.527,0.4207,1.4654,5.8003,2.1126,2.6172,2.3398,2.1531,0.0411,5.551,0.0159,1.5661,4.7555,0.0014,0.8874,1.738,3.1185,0.9506,6.1742,4.8059,0.4048,0.7931,0.0275,0.6534,3.6398,2.6037,5.7335,1.5158,1.0944,3.235,1.1958,2.5192,3.8197,5.1537,1.4432,4.4489,1.3256,2.7427,0.4581,3.5678,0.078,0.2211,1.4453,2.2117,0.0346,1.6628,2.4119,8.0519,0.4601,0.6162,0.0099,0.7291,1.8885,5.4165,1.0875,1.0414,1.1556,2.7816,2.3657,6.1635,2.7776,3.2774,3.0515,0.0792,6.3455,0.0003,0.002,0.0424,3.8291,0.8289,4.5771,2.3383,4.1049,0.6312,1.9403,2.5372,0.0807,1.3538,5.3413,0.4115,1.9232,0.0004,0.0032,0.0083,2.4542,5.9726,5.6488,0.0934,0.9046,1.4355,3.5319,3.0272,5.0427,0.5134,0.5779,2.6065,6.6069,4.8612,1.5767,9.9319,1.1717,5.8441,5.0324,0.0009,0.6079,1.5819,3.2131,0.0004,0.0022,0.003,2.1687,0.0014,2.9505,4.8531,7.2194,2.9848,8.6005,0.1327,5.1436,2.6743,3.6659,1.1941,1.81,0.2252,3.0322,0.3726,2.5381,1.8155,4.1421,0.0047,2.5842,3.7509,4.2062,1.0353,0.5995,3.9544,0.4586,1.5357,1.9511,0.0425,0.8942,8.9179,0.7038,0.0542,9.0389,3.2929,0.3495,1.5005,3.8861,0.1699,0.9308,3.0464,0.6908,1.0618,0.2157,0.3786,0.4153,1.9477,2.8914,5.1754,3.5402,2.6023,0.3447,1.6172,0.2355,0.22,0.5848,5.0584,0.9722,2.9613,0.0039,0.1838,0.0513,0.2048,3.4506,0.0046,1.219,3.9401,3.5961,0.8933,0.0805,4.4233,3.1062,1.4035,5.672,2.428,3.8363,3.3051,1.4001,2.1701,2.9674,6.9035,0.3444,4.5508,1.1602,0.3904,1.8681,3.4401,6.663,4.9834,5.2037,3.6048,4.052,0.3864,5.6068,3.1638,2.9252,0.0004,0.0012,0.0021,3.0208,5.8992,1.9003,0.8898,3.4253,3.953,2.1048,2.3016,3.6113,0.8834,4.647,0.1667,0.1098,0.9238,2.1648,1.4425,0.0024,0.9304,6.3466,0.177,1.6105]}
{"prompt":"Brazil s planning minister on Monday acknowledged the possibility of delaying a key vote on a bill cutting social security spending to 2018 but said its approval would be difficult then , an election year","text":"Brazil s planning minister on Monday acknowledged the possibility of delaying a key vote on a bill cutting social security spending to 2018 but said its approval would be difficult then, an election year later.\nThe draft law aimed at curbing rising social security and unemployment benefits costs by more than 70 billion reals ($19 billion) has been in parliament since last December.\nIt was part of a proposal approved by the Congress last week that now faces major hurdles in the Senate. President Dilma Rousseff won a reelection victory despite the protests, but a recent opinion poll showed that many Brazilians support further reductions in welfare and retiree benefits.\nPresident Michel Temer, whom analysts have called the country's main architect of the economic reforms, had promised that spending cuts and raising taxes on profits above a certain threshold would be implemented immediately before the end of this year, but is delaying the vote on the new bill.\n\"This is a difficult election year for us,\" he said at a news conference following the meeting with ministers and senior officials at his office in Sao Paulo that focused on the budget and fiscal reforms that the government has proposed in recent months.\nAt least three proposals the government has submitted to the Congress will have to wait because of various procedural difficulties, the economic minister, Meirelles, warned yesterday.\nThe measures are based on a long list of economic reform proposals that were submitted by Meirelles to Congress last week and that the government wants to implement urgently, given mounting national debt payments, growing public deficit and low economic growth. Most are aimed in the areas of tax increases and a tax hike on companies with substantial profits, a practice known as the corporate tax break.\nOne of those bills, dubbed the \"Reform and Transparency of Social Security Benefits\", has been in the legislature for just five weeks and was being worked on to find a broad public consensus.\nThe president has been vocal in his push to implement the tax changes, but many economists and businessmen have cautioned against taking radical measures that could slow growth and jeopardize job creation after years of stagnating inflation.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on September 18, 2016, with the headline 'No decision on Social Security cuts until after elections'.

However, the president has come under increased pressure from both domestic audiences, which do not trust his decision to leave the accord, and foreign opponents, who fear the United States seeks to weaken a country that has played a key role in the Middle East.\n\u201cIn accordance with President PI:USER, and on behalf of the U.S., the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, China, and China, the European Union, and the United Nations, Iran and the P5+1 will sign a new international agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d Macron said.\nThe decision may also bring international condemnation, especially from European allies of the U.S. But Macron said on Friday: \u201cWe expect the Iranian people to come forward in protest. We do not support the Iranian people. \u201c\nThis is followed by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who told France Info: \u201cWe think that by announcing at this time such a step, they confirm what President Trump said and they say to the Iranians that there is no international pressure on them. \u201c\nThe United States said that it would work with partners such as the U.N., European Union, and China \u201cto restore the implementation\u201d of a deal that barred Iran from developing nuclear weapons amid heavy sanctions and continued pressure it was seen as seeking nuclear weapons.

{"prompt":"Japan said on Wednesday any attempt by South Korea to revise a 2015 deal meant to have resolved a row over comfort women forced to work in Japan s wartime brothels would make relations unmanageable","text":"Japan said on Wednesday any attempt by South Korea to revise a 2015 deal meant to have resolved a row over comfort women forced to work in Japan s wartime brothels would make relations unmanageable.\nIn a rare official acknowledgement, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the country was concerned about reports of a draft South Korean bill trying to rewrite the agreement that Japan agreed to after the signing ceremony in Tokyo in 1995.\nNortheastern South Korea was ravaged by Communist forces between 1942 and 1945 with a quarter of the country becoming a war zone. Thousands of women, most of Asian and aboriginal background, including Koreans, Chinese and Japanese, were trafficked into Japanese military brothels.\nThe South has vowed to seek recompense for comfort women survivors.\nThe 2015 accord, initially to have come into effect in May, will only be valid as long as Japan does not file a lawsuit in court, a sign of the diplomatic impasse.\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe said it had been agreed verbally in 2015 as part of a broader package containing the memorandum, not as a formal agreement, and no country had been able to get through the process.\nBut his comments over the weekend in Osaka over the draft bill appeared to spell trouble ahead in diplomatic talks.\nJapanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi in Tokyo on Sunday denounced South Korean attempts to \"undue\" the 2015 accord.\nHe said he hoped Tokyo's new bill would not be a \"bombshell\" that could trigger retaliation by South Korea, but if it was he called for calm and said Japan did not want to drag it into negotiations.\nUnder the 2015 deal for compensation for the survivors, Japan has set aside US$5 billion (S$6.5 billion) over the next two decades to help fund programmes for survivors and descendants.\nHowever, the agreement has so far faced an inability to resolve questions over how much money should be spent and where. A recent court resolution said a lower amount should be offered.\nThe draft bill would require Japan to consult with the survivors of the comfort women scandal in compensation negotiations as well as ensure they were properly represented.\nJapan will seek reparations to survivors even if it has reached agreements, even with countries that never participated in them, as the country has pursued it independently.","token_len":463,"entropy":[6.5539,2.1987,2.1673,8.2091,3.6754,1.7447,5.6728,0.5891,0.1121,7.0066,3.9967,5.7365,4.1575,5.5537,1.7963,6.0435,7.7515,3.332,4.1642,0.3573,11.7021,2.7301,7.0419,0.6705,1.2008,1.0646,3.5671,10.3227,10.9014,3.3045,0.0198,0.0,1.2527,6.1457,9.3032,13.3563,0.0234,0.0161,0.3055,0.1012,15.8303,0.9606,3.0782,6.2294,5.4145,1.7084,3.3572,2.7319,3.1225,0.0719,2.04,0.5013,1.4794,2.8367,1.8542,4.6588,0.9574,4.8153,1.1396,2.5891,6.7799,5.2593,0.3275,3.8315,7.1377,0.0044,4.2099,0.6599,3.4313,2.3485,5.3286,3.7424,0.2547,3.4988,1.2797,5.666,3.0714,1.3025,2.227,1.7649,4.9796,0.2085,0.1791,6.3963,6.6719,2.1924,4.5415,0.1049,3.6141,11.1324,0.0744,8.5822,3.1202,5.4044,6.2212,0.1594,0.279,5.1507,3.0464,6.1594,0.2424,0.9852,0.9408,6.3875,1.6902,4.2025,0.5527,1.169,6.1793,0.5055,1.3319,3.2175,3.6671,0.5804,10.6625,2.8915,7.7993,5.4224,0.1395,6.5189,4.2515,0.4684,4.6409,0.6854,1.3906,0.42,0.7624,4.6497,0.0002,1.8628,3.1789,6.734,0.6327,0.0132,0.003,1.4318,0.3835,1.9249,3.4276,4.5371,5.1561,0.2334,4.5657,9.1848,0.0326,0.9242,9.7152,0.0744,6.7761,2.0788,0.5849,2.2889,8.1772,3.98,1.8046,6.6226,4.5529,3.1283,3.7744,0.3771,1.1767,0.9564,3.196,0.8967,3.6698,4.1545,1.8366,5.5729,4.3059,0.1693,0.0051,2.581,3.5666,0.0854,8.3755,1.0558,1.89,3.1604,1.6994,1.9316,2.7354,5.7539,1.2871,1.888,6.2536,4.7517,0.0203,1.6522,0.4772,5.6067,0.0105,0.0554,0.0023,2.093,3.3928,3.1571,0.8975,1.5936,10.4249,3.1773,4.5903,6.1674,0.8178,0.001,1.0408,3.2443,3.3412,7.4857,3.411,9.1737,2.297,6.1702,2.188,0.6821,3.1511,1.6328,2.0625,2.0349,4.7473,6.3503,1.8831,2.6788,2.5155,0.0262,4.5836,4.2747,1.1112,3.2518,0.9754,0.3152,3.2909,3.9465,2.7866,6.8735,0.212,0.3977,4.159,4.7027,6.7851,0.9805,4.609,2.3969,4.8029,0.1395,6.3758,0.9433,3.6316,4.0691,6.2993,1.6749,2.064,0.3668,4.1449,1.1283,0.2479,6.7623,2.6304,0.0995,5.3874,5.7953,0.2586,6.2233,1.3281,1.6652,2.4867,5.0108,3.972,1.8738,3.2515,0.2185,4.7913,7.7141,2.3519,4.34,1.4628,6.8161,1.6628,1.754,0.3453,3.2409,0.5671,2.7383,2.4329,5.0078,3.3295,4.1234,3.9464,0.4601,2.7398,1.7734,3.0704,1.5425,4.7144,3.4704,0.023,0.3713,2.1618,2.1956,4.3622,5.341,2.0749,1.6289,0.1568,2.2088,2.1183,6.188,0.7537,2.6071,4.5687,5.9597,1.2036,5.9929,1.861,2.4193,2.2226,4.0423,0.0588,1.3157,0.8491,6.3108,2.9083,1.5492,4.9149,1.0953,0.1863,4.7098,0.3877,2.9577,1.731,6.1486,5.2541,1.2869,2.2689,3.0688,0.7703,1.5745,3.7768,4.6491,1.2299,7.0127,0.0567,3.2076,0.7984,4.7996,4.5734,0.0265,2.1744,0.2794,2.0272,0.0615,0.0869,3.867,1.874,0.1958,2.3984,1.2532,0.7068,1.8912,3.8609,7.7472,1.9573,2.7605,1.9435,8.0822,2.9863,0.473,4.2872,0.1371,1.8097,3.8543,2.1871,3.4792,0.0005,4.3751,4.459,7.1128,0.1927,3.7426,5.0989,1.4021,2.8033,1.0043,2.2846,3.6787,0.1254,1.5259,2.0327,3.4865,2.0557,4.279,4.4842,5.0567,7.3308,2.9782,4.1477,6.8246,3.6666,2.3531,0.3251,5.6929,2.7041,0.2744,2.0307,3.5286,1.9538,3.0848,3.8179,2.1506,0.1449,6.6136,0.6209,1.2524,3.6349,2.5847,1.7638,3.4974,0.1441,7.6223,2.2124,5.0374,5.3097,4.5457,0.5207,0.0106,5.8584,2.4304,2.066,4.0517,3.1984,1.3587,0.5398,3.7188,3.4325,4.1437,6.8729,0.0491,3.8564,3.36,6.1549,0.4065,1.4776,3.2149,5.9389,4.989,4.4065,5.3468,4.6136,5.0375,1.2846,6.1875,5.2498,0.3915,4.4551,1.0791,4.0694,2.5115,3.9804,1.6123,7.373,4.9689,8.0572,0.99]}

There are people that think it makes more sense to send soldiers to war in Africa, for instance, when there will be no impact on the Argentinean people, \u201d Dujovne told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nAsked how much more of a priority it will be to pay those who lost their lives, which the government has said will cost $2 billion, he would only say: \u201c It is very important. \"\nDujovne, who until recently was one of Macri\u2019s economic advisers and served on his cabinet, said this would not only help the families of those who died on board the submarine but will also be \u201c very important \u201d in terms of its \u201c public image. \u201c\nThe government has been ordered to pay 1,125 Argentine pesos ($29) a month in compensation by the National Commission for the Disappearance of Persons, a legal body created to try to find the whereabouts of about 1,200 suspects it considers \u201c disappeared \u201d.\nBut officials say they plan to increase that amount, which has been criticized as an attempt by the government to save money.\nDespite the controversy surrounding the money, Macri is planning to send a team to New York to meet this weekend with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to hand him the book that will document the state of the country\u2019s armed forces.\nThe books will be one of the main items in President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s trip to Argentina in mid-April.\nMacri, who is being hailed as one of the great economic success stories of the continent, faces an increasingly popular backlash over accusations that he and his allies took control of the country\u2019s government with an authoritarian plan.\nThe current crisis began in December when the U.S. government dropped the bombshell that the Argentine Navy had been monitoring submarines from one of the world\u2019s most powerful military regimes, the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.","token_len":463,"entropy":[9.1503,0.5073,4.2696,2.9866,7.1941,5.5709,0.441,2.0079,4.1161,1.8731,6.6442,0.0437,3.0704,7.4727,4.3993,8.1829,1.8824,4.4356,4.3342,3.4058,8.7408,3.6378,1.876,1.1143,5.4526,2.3315,2.8575,3.7487,0.0192,2.3947,3.2704,6.438,0.9135,0.3206,2.0873,1.5423,0.0018,0.0185,0.0005,5.1641,2.3234,3.6545,3.2539,2.3625,5.1566,1.1101,3.4831,4.0951,0.3971,0.314,10.4811,11.7324,2.2453,2.5653,5.3243,0.8902,1.7233,3.7852,2.7325,0.3695,1.7684,4.042,1.3671,3.2494,2.0428,3.223,2.5769,6.1924,3.0548,0.1381,0.3585,3.5454,4.7165,0.9285,3.8256,2.3471,3.9929,1.8051,5.2005,2.1194,0.9551,4.2712,2.0646,5.197,0.0811,2.2077,8.0274,0.43,1.1841,7.3785,3.434,3.5437,2.4002,14.6173,8.2536,13.6071,3.1843,6.5285,5.9205,3.2851,2.6621,2.65,1.8205,0.7375,0.0661,0.6391,0.7656,7.2773,3.002,2.4362,3.8216,3.6023,1.4904,4.5665,2.4216,2.3216,0.2568,0.697,5.2731,6.0433,1.9098,2.8026,0.2068,0.0743,1.8116,6.6545,3.5331,2.6557,1.9138,1.7775,2.2582,2.6488,1.3951,3.0167,0.7365,0.7334,3.4717,5.8111,0.6824,0.4934,2.4056,9.4922,5.0575,6.2557,1.4682,3.4082,0.4915,1.9314,5.6664,1.3865,4.5485,0.4963,0.0087,0.0104,2.4825,0.7284,6.9886,1.0156,1.0692,3.7507,0.01,3.8023,0.01,13.821,8.3937,0.5503,5.926,1.2744,2.5549,5.4274,2.771,1.699,2.37,1.2883,1.5543,5.2004,3.0572,1.8579,4.3868,2.9442,1.5275,6.8937,0.2106,0.5872,0.8106,2.019,4.3509,3.2087,1.4563,2.3769,0.8255,3.807,0.4099,2.9099,13.9155,2.3029,4.9706,0.8277,6.3783,0.5036,3.3185,3.0849,0.0014,5.4916,11.4143,2.5048,5.5482,2.1399,0.5275,5.7113,1.5034,1.253,2.2236,2.95,1.4447,2.5332,7.1868,0.4702,1.6524,5.792,1.7708,6.1274,1.8865,1.9613,0.0051,0.3265,6.1992,0.8741,2.4417,1.0767,1.3675,1.5716,6.1229,0.9193,4.5454,5.3404,0.9232,1.3123,6.6076,0.8756,0.2168,3.9841,2.2982,2.4193,5.4892,1.3545,4.4,1.1783,5.3655,1.1054,2.647,1.3238,3.4799,0.0803,7.0164,2.1431,0.117,2.0664,5.6274,7.7354,4.4165,11.006,1.7726,5.4743,5.3758,0.7049,6.022,0.4856,4.0647,5.4003,2.0687,2.5319,5.1707,0.0664,3.8341,1.8912,1.5573,2.5605,2.4581,3.2616,1.2157,6.6083,1.2799,3.7672,2.9181,2.2146,0.8868,0.6199,0.1081,5.5923,0.9197,1.1766,0.395,5.8979,0.9672,5.0466,3.3859,0.5725,5.2887,0.4387,2.6434,0.0071,2.8343,6.0864,0.2582,4.5083,2.1602,2.9366,1.2655,6.5095,0.3023,0.6254,2.277,7.0761,4.0844,0.8588,4.957,0.3824,1.353,1.4438,0.0011,1.5765,0.0019,0.0,0.0001,1.0787,8.659,4.3007,1.2463,7.2457,3.8538,0.9557,4.9221,0.6714,5.0227,0.0917,0.5493,1.9457,3.9898,3.8958,0.2166,0.3333,0.0049,0.5844,0.428,1.8097,7.0561,1.0574,0.7698,6.6313,0.5479,0.8684,3.1086,2.883,2.0324,4.578,5.9906,0.0136,3.4279,0.5742,0.0299,4.8221,0.1084,3.107,2.3701,4.3495,0.0469,2.5391,1.0647,0.8063,1.3944,2.1561,2.165,0.6139,1.5933,5.0594,3.1363,0.3768,3.2406,0.0078,0.2858,4.5314,4.257,4.9603,0.0176,0.4164,1.3793,4.6696,0.3887,5.5677,3.2781,3.6276,5.2605,2.2187,1.974,6.0533,0.9976,0.381,4.5139,0.4024,3.3015,6.3137,4.9674,0.1345,0.7452,1.3742,3.407,0.16,0.1174,4.789,3.6417,3.6945,4.6451,5.5777,3.0564,0.4017,2.1494,5.6704,3.6855,3.1934,1.577,3.2722,0.9482,1.5312,4.4601,0.0019,0.3643,0.3285,2.3477,5.5031,1.9945,5.6217,0.7974,1.762,1.262,4.0325,0.7959,2.3789,5.7088,5.8818,4.5304,4.9796,0.3343,1.2006,2.27,4.3106,0.2649,0.0103,1.3159,1.7241,3.4554,7.5006,1.5176,2.4308,8.7028,2.3648,3.5403,0.1211,0.3081,0.0653,0.0013,0.404]}

Marco Rubio has been campaigning for a stronger proposal.\nThe Senate, which was scheduled to hold a markup on a debt ceiling increase on Thursday, is also divided, with Democrat leader Harry Reid saying he would hold off on a vote until March.\nIn a speech from the White House, the president also promised to send a bill to Congress that would bring back a number of provisions the GOP voted down in the tax bill.\n\"This would make it easier for a lot of American families making moderate incomes to save for retirement or, in the case of college students, make college more affordable,\" said Trump, also criticizing the Senate Democrats for delaying a debate on his tax bill.\n\"The tax cut package we passed is a great plan, and you want a tax cut on it, just take it away,\" said Trump, pointing out that Republicans were behind a $1.5 trillion tax reform plan that was approved in the House but then died in the Senate.\nThe debt ceiling increase is likely to come under fire from conservative hawks, some of whom see a tax bill as preferable.\nThe bill would provide $300 billion for law enforcement agencies and another $170 billion for state and local governments, but it wouldn't raise the deduction for the federal student loan system, nor would it increase the maximum amount of tax credits per person.","token_len":464,"entropy":[3.6707,1.4879,4.1883,0.0016,0.0422,0.1786,1.2853,0.6823,0.0027,4.7524,4.822,4.9283,1.9,0.1466,5.113,1.3328,5.4037,1.4405,8.2535,8.2996,0.1182,4.9216,3.0602,3.8914,2.7234,6.9167,0.0172,9.4326,6.9643,2.815,3.2317,7.6222,0.3609,1.902,4.3958,1.1758,2.6921,4.251,1.5431,6.1103,0.1933,0.2646,15.2411,5.2519,4.9074,5.0938,5.036,3.3667,0.0003,1.4557,1.3914,3.7464,5.7946,4.1242,1.2196,4.2703,1.2621,1.9769,3.8549,3.4633,2.2392,6.5624,1.6752,6.0255,5.4315,9.6963,4.2733,3.085,3.3369,6.3889,0.0284,8.6193,3.7481,2.6125,7.118,11.4226,1.4053,0.4609,4.617,0.9687,1.734,0.0299,3.4763,0.0037,2.8076,6.0051,0.0023,1.8027,0.0513,3.4249,0.1259,1.146,3.532,4.4631,6.2407,3.0716,3.4475,1.5903,5.174,1.731,1.8735,1.3653,5.4973,2.2303,4.4557,0.5687,4.1726,4.0071,0.0005,1.0721,7.4286,1.6553,0.7426,5.7385,1.9851,0.5629,3.9207,1.7819,3.6772,0.592,3.7285,2.0384,5.7428,1.3624,4.3975,11.1031,4.0709,4.9757,5.7354,1.8449,5.7839,0.3928,0.204,3.0836,2.3767,4.9726,2.9829,5.1923,0.3827,2.6942,2.2377,1.3237,2.1698,7.34,0.0002,0.0,0.0003,7.101,0.3417,0.6465,2.7974,0.0556,0.048,3.9484,5.4398,2.2457,0.2006,0.2217,0.9929,6.3383,0.8268,0.0228,4.1319,1.3993,2.4146,1.9625,0.0145,5.8676,3.181,1.6675,0.3804,0.3364,0.5483,4.7123,5.7542,5.5625,3.3316,2.0714,3.4621,2.8596,1.7003,0.6317,3.444,0.001,2.8581,2.8792,0.0005,1.5681,1.3866,6.1393,0.0032,2.265,0.001,3.0635,0.0017,6.4545,1.3994,6.8056,0.849,1.2745,6.4571,4.8836,0.7051,0.2963,3.042,3.0213,3.0861,1.5181,4.1028,3.2254,0.0704,2.2618,0.5327,4.6305,0.6911,2.0925,3.4374,1.8478,1.9309,1.1313,1.3703,0.303,2.0804,3.4118,6.9061,2.8132,0.4047,7.2394,6.4524,0.1536,0.0005,3.771,0.9147,1.8273,4.3245,2.2912,0.4396,1.0043,0.9226,0.9555,6.2868,1.759,0.7112,3.5754,1.3105,3.6394,4.5944,1.2176,1.3505,0.0003,1.1044,3.1698,1.6858,3.0314,3.651,0.768,4.9332,1.423,4.2027,0.5235,0.8291,1.9011,0.564,4.5405,2.8107,2.6121,3.9853,0.0043,2.5516,4.9378,2.6071,5.4426,1.2253,1.141,0.9977,4.0546,0.3647,1.126,0.6341,1.6866,3.1206,4.4969,4.1306,1.3528,1.0675,0.3145,4.5404,1.6116,0.0084,5.2023,0.2505,8.0567,10.5297,1.3039,0.6158,3.6413,1.1175,0.2913,3.5083,6.2524,1.8108,1.3618,0.8336,0.0168,4.9709,2.2031,0.2909,5.3883,4.7934,1.6454,0.1235,1.0732,2.8849,2.1994,1.4074,5.6104,5.8474,1.2705,2.4682,4.1508,0.9512,4.4384,1.6464,6.0922,0.4569,4.9194,1.067,2.4072,0.3741,0.3735,3.9999,2.5101,4.5525,3.4229,3.789,2.4679,2.4756,3.9723,1.7595,2.3438,5.1136,1.6965,1.3837,4.7945,4.6128,2.904,3.1496,0.6245,5.4542,5.6096,1.7495,5.4715,6.0429,1.5643,2.8716,1.3474,2.6588,0.699,0.8901,5.6687,1.8464,0.3449,2.3328,3.4868,6.2717,1.3935,3.4489,1.1818,0.7352,1.6794,0.0093,1.2632,4.5129,1.721,1.514,2.3295,3.2668,1.5233,1.3053,1.2352,3.0126,3.746,4.3401,0.4112,0.0603,0.0349,0.5804,0.3603,1.8816,4.6667,1.1188,3.1328,1.7145,3.3785,0.1189,3.3938,3.1601,2.5896,0.5637,3.2075,6.7251,0.002,1.379,3.5901,0.3102,0.047,2.8207,2.8119,3.853,2.8028,0.8755,7.7573,3.9844,0.902,2.5839,4.7388,1.5111,4.1524,2.0867,5.2601,0.0159,2.6668,8.3499,0.0772,2.5783,1.5151,4.8376,0.0148,5.731,0.0033,0.4597,4.4939,0.124,0.0136,1.4021,1.1915,2.6297,1.837,4.0525,0.0001,2.3467,1.0949,8.8993,0.3981,4.3159,3.9377,4.8767,0.2495,6.397,1.0861,7.0817,0.645,0.1116,2.5269,0.7492,4.7057,2.4172,1.1603,2.6088,1.0003,7.547,3.3023,1.0944]}

Tunisia late on","text":"The United Arab Emirates has information that Tunisian women or women traveling on Tunisian passports might commit terrorist acts in the Gulf country, Tunisia s state news agency TAP said. Tunisia late on Wednesday ordered all public transport vehicles in the capital to be searched for any threat of suicide bombings, as attacks on mosques and other prominent sites in the country continue. The Tunisian Interior Ministry issued the alert two days after a suicide bomber struck a mosque in the Sousse town of southern Tunisia where an extremist preacher was holding an anti-Islamic rally, killing at least 28 people and wounding dozens more. The Islamist had been condemned twice in the past five years by the judiciary for instigating racial and social hatred. On Wednesday morning a large group of supporters of the preacher gathered in Sousse, chanting slogans against the court. Thousands of demonstrators converged on the city center, chanting anti-foreign slogans to the tune of the national anthem. A demonstration at La Marsa, another Sousse bastion, turned violent with the police using tear gas to disperse the crowds after several security personnel were injured. The Interior Ministry on Wednesday accused the Tunisian Islamic Brotherhood of having recruited fighters who carried out the suicide attacks as part of a terrorist network. It said it has uncovered plans for \" massive terrorist operations \" following the suicide bombings, in the capital and in Sousse. The Interior Ministry warned that it was searching for dozens of men and women who had links to the extremist Islamic movements. Tunisia, where more than half of the population is Shiite Muslim, is one of the Gulf Arab countries targeted by militants operating under the banner of Islamic State. A suspected suicide bomber struck a restaurant in Grand Tunis, killing 39 people, including 16 children. The attack had its worst impact in the coastal city of Sousse, where a man drove a car loaded with explosives to a mosque where it detonated. A second suicide bomber set up a truck bomb outside the headquarters of a local university where he was killed by Tunisian soldiers. A suicide attacker used a motorcycle packed with explosives to attack a popular beach in the Skanes district of the capital, killing 20 people and wounding more than 100.

The total number of newly registered enterprises in the capital and in the provinces was 3,200 and 6,600, up 8 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, from the same periods","token_len":465,"entropy":[8.9529,0.7086,8.7446,11.5061,0.604,6.775,4.8511,2.0927,3.0101,2.5337,0.0888,2.5139,3.7502,0.3133,4.307,0.0409,2.268,3.5615,4.4687,3.5184,3.9813,1.8657,5.6597,0.0011,0.0013,2.4319,1.9876,9.3588,1.4971,1.0926,5.4904,2.6345,0.2152,8.3582,1.2689,0.0294,6.4337,0.6925,9.3195,0.2142,0.6315,7.4636,1.2043,0.275,0.7352,5.6175,3.5335,3.8514,3.1961,1.5871,4.0399,7.6969,1.8843,4.6857,1.4625,0.5871,1.8213,1.0092,3.3399,5.2149,0.0041,2.7532,1.4603,8.7185,7.1085,4.5923,0.4428,2.343,2.0939,9.6695,4.9776,2.3386,3.4568,0.0307,4.9492,6.7915,0.552,1.6963,2.5724,4.5015,5.8257,2.1586,1.4064,5.1204,7.3363,13.8315,2.1009,4.617,1.4754,0.3136,0.0214,0.0001,0.1891,1.3114,8.2819,4.9148,3.9182,1.0527,1.4385,1.1678,0.4052,7.3344,0.5204,4.3407,0.3503,0.3812,8.6563,0.2212,3.8897,3.9771,8.7033,9.3826,0.7683,9.0328,7.1953,2.1466,0.0422,0.6328,0.139,0.0394,2.3214,2.0089,6.8194,2.1867,2.6917,0.4916,1.5492,5.6866,0.4351,5.2896,0.8317,7.8041,1.9191,6.8493,0.0862,4.493,3.5477,4.9742,5.4814,3.1369,0.3073,3.5081,0.9776,6.7875,0.2098,2.3349,5.7188,5.3623,0.6586,0.341,1.1746,0.0374,5.6069,4.4482,2.627,0.7298,5.7881,1.1946,4.2071,0.6316,6.0455,0.708,1.2559,5.0783,2.8967,0.0135,4.0362,0.2103,1.2118,3.79,1.166,2.403,8.377,3.7859,1.867,5.8113,10.3073,5.2191,3.7953,2.2215,4.6877,3.2189,0.0259,4.3144,0.0015,3.206,4.1844,2.4864,2.9891,3.7296,0.0251,6.4933,7.2473,10.5756,0.7267,2.4558,5.543,3.1453,2.3842,6.1927,0.4042,1.1825,1.9149,1.2057,6.6094,6.1987,16.9647,2.6903,4.36,8.2979,0.0068,0.0047,4.5789,2.9544,3.5221,3.6981,4.2176,8.1359,3.0637,1.2022,1.1421,3.4064,7.6237,1.6939,5.6256,2.461,4.335,1.2985,0.0773,0.0044,5.2165,0.2922,5.7239,4.4394,2.1559,6.5818,5.0515,2.0678,3.0834,3.0096,0.3577,0.4062,0.4109,2.4789,3.9065,0.0537,3.742,4.7179,3.7731,0.4845,3.8696,2.4109,1.7766,2.9792,0.0065,5.6054,3.3608,1.8808,4.6555,0.0037,0.2964,0.0051,4.6073,4.8257,5.7885,5.9909,1.8608,0.2249,5.3464,0.8741,0.7964,2.7481,1.8951,3.355,2.4015,0.5792,1.6734,3.8422,4.9194,0.0466,3.8916,2.0115,0.0644,2.6832,1.5512,1.5722,2.2161,2.6214,0.7394,1.5658,0.7662,0.0056,1.9215,0.9238,2.4635,5.4444,0.4604,1.985,0.002,3.1514,3.5522,7.0231,7.2457,2.5489,3.0325,2.7212,2.3666,5.8167,3.6373,1.7493,1.7917,0.8875,2.0381,3.2528,1.3963,6.6815,4.4367,2.2915,0.0083,6.636,1.963,0.9505,2.9873,2.4887,6.3278,1.1467,1.4334,5.6124,2.0843,6.93,0.6575,4.6135,0.5958,7.0673,0.2547,1.4787,1.9083,3.7739,2.5286,0.0027,7.9037,0.9323,3.1162,0.0534,1.1679,0.6945,1.4445,3.4048,0.0043,5.968,1.808,3.2847,6.9909,2.6527,1.6842,5.9235,0.6718,0.2752,0.731,0.138,4.3111,0.265,4.0222,1.1737,3.5046,2.9422,3.6423,4.8753,1.4893,0.3296,3.6574,5.1598,0.6956,3.5186,0.8759,3.9183,2.0945,0.9679,4.5325,2.9647,2.2021,0.0026,0.7677,5.2963,3.7985,0.9175,1.3221,1.997,0.0322,1.4503,4.1298,4.2758,1.7942,0.3323,0.1061,3.8045,3.2898,0.0003,1.4311,0.2714,1.4292,3.6884,0.7817,0.0071,1.2166,1.7966,5.1546,4.2074,0.4462,2.0441,1.3827,2.3217,0.0797,3.4362,1.4345,4.1596,5.136,3.1541,1.3255,3.4562,0.0106,4.6404,3.1477,0.6628,1.0616,1.4498,1.9074,3.7149,0.1639,0.0215,5.6027,0.0391,0.2773,1.5205,1.2913,1.7219,5.8624,2.1217,0.6387,2.6338,1.4449,3.283,0.0737,3.2737,4.6483,3.9604,0.1155,2.7403,1.8809,7.3252,3.6622,0.3283,0.0001,3.5389,3.1086,0.0508,0.0003,2.3348,0.0043,0.7524,1.0829,0.483,0.5155,6.9447]}
{"prompt":"The Swiss government proposed on Friday allowing house arrest for people seen as posing a security threat even if they are not suspected of a specific crime . The step is part of an anti-terrorism","text":"The Swiss government proposed on Friday allowing house arrest for people seen as posing a security threat even if they are not suspected of a specific crime. The step is part of an anti-terrorism bill to be introduced with immediate effect, the authorities said. The proposal sets a maximum time period of 10 days for house arrest. However, the duration of the arrest cannot be longer than 30 days, they said. Those who are allowed to remain in their homes will receive constant supervision from police and can only leave them for shopping and medical appointments. The police will also keep records of their movements, the lawmakers said.\nThe proposed bill will go before a referendum to be held on Aug. 31. It has the backing of the federal government, but its opposition by cantons such as Zurich and Berne has already raised doubts about its effectiveness. The cantons have so far only agreed to the proposal to introduce the concept of \"significant threat\".\nThe proposal means that cantons can give their own interpretation of the term \"significant threat\". This is already required by Swiss law, but that law allows people to be detained under the guise of \"orderly\" house arrest on a voluntary basis in the absence of crime. The controversial element here could be any other crime that authorities find to be \"likely to affect public security.\" Under the proposal, they would be free to interpret their own interpretation.\nSome see the proposal as overly broad in its definition of risk to public security. Others say the government has not made sufficient proposals to back the implementation.\n\"Police and prisons are already over-crowded with a large number of people. I am not sure that there is room for house arrest,\" said Ulrich Fett, the head of the federal commission on the prison system.\nThere are currently 2,900 people in Switzerland in detention under house arrest, according to estimates. The commission that oversees prisons said in 2011 that up to 5,000 people were currently in prison for non-vigilant house arrest under the guise of preventive detention. Some 800 people were at that time on the waiting list.\nThe bill is aimed at countering an increasingly common trend among terrorism suspects and other detainees to abscond from prisons and flee home. Many have been involved in attacks - some in Germany and Austria - in recent years.","token_len":465,"entropy":[10.2191,2.7755,7.243,4.3826,2.9942,6.9378,9.1381,4.9292,1.2789,2.7147,6.5571,0.8227,7.5227,0.6675,2.6957,0.9857,7.4721,0.9312,0.3375,1.4563,0.8256,2.1179,0.2069,2.6445,4.8328,0.7338,0.3581,2.8999,7.7094,1.6797,2.0524,0.0014,2.1909,4.5274,0.0023,0.4991,2.4688,3.5574,2.2582,1.1181,6.0138,6.8307,0.02,2.7236,1.8423,7.2464,0.2139,0.3589,2.8933,3.6462,6.2986,1.9433,2.7694,4.0459,4.2804,0.9065,3.6612,0.9971,0.9771,4.1196,0.1117,1.4375,5.0693,0.0543,1.4331,8.8301,1.2052,0.891,2.8167,3.5938,0.8178,2.605,0.0598,2.3555,0.0327,1.669,3.5727,0.5427,0.0838,6.0397,2.4708,1.1792,6.91,0.0987,1.3682,0.6264,3.5492,0.689,3.1379,4.6963,10.1184,2.6914,2.0654,1.953,1.8317,4.1939,4.204,3.6102,3.6113,2.0704,10.0745,1.9551,6.5562,3.366,0.6565,1.7302,4.6322,1.9397,1.3042,4.3312,4.136,0.3736,1.9747,1.7883,1.7937,2.7547,5.7716,0.1876,0.1396,1.4814,10.1995,4.2613,2.8146,2.5741,4.2287,1.2468,2.1527,6.3635,3.7837,1.8846,0.191,1.5581,5.7778,0.0817,4.0663,0.7635,2.2367,2.8555,3.1658,1.3933,0.0076,1.3735,6.411,0.7477,0.9635,3.6507,4.0754,4.4466,5.7286,9.0019,0.2252,5.0681,0.0022,2.8978,0.7343,5.6674,1.8721,3.0199,3.8842,4.075,2.1568,1.0035,1.2198,1.8372,0.2736,1.7578,3.4853,0.2133,1.6232,4.8882,0.0013,4.4708,1.9609,0.1894,2.5397,1.9349,3.3681,5.3515,1.7206,7.0316,0.5364,2.7313,8.2587,3.5428,2.9701,1.156,1.5051,2.6036,6.1816,0.6044,7.6885,0.0322,2.4302,5.3591,2.4645,2.8212,6.7432,0.2619,0.6516,4.3556,0.5835,0.5945,0.0802,1.2209,3.913,2.0283,5.9209,5.6081,1.0939,2.1764,0.225,0.9945,1.5913,4.8611,3.347,4.1178,5.1819,0.7009,1.6584,2.2455,3.5895,1.55,4.3919,0.0352,1.7009,8.9979,1.4312,2.9219,7.8122,0.0428,5.0322,2.576,5.0726,0.0143,4.6302,2.4785,2.3861,0.0026,7.4222,0.5362,1.6887,6.1959,8.7152,6.6506,4.4103,1.3569,6.1125,4.3721,2.7148,2.4168,6.1439,3.9968,2.7753,0.1647,1.5978,4.6484,0.4903,3.979,1.5377,2.1728,3.3984,6.078,0.6586,1.569,0.203,4.6058,1.1954,1.2225,5.6014,0.0726,9.7187,3.3459,0.9811,3.2902,2.2885,1.1295,4.9943,6.4381,0.6216,1.7825,0.1347,5.5139,0.7775,3.3594,1.9084,2.4103,0.7299,5.8166,4.3984,0.3118,1.058,0.5883,4.2027,1.8059,1.8119,3.6501,2.2296,2.8798,3.8958,3.0343,6.5575,0.9521,7.5548,1.8803,6.5213,2.5857,1.1723,1.4934,6.5131,2.6934,6.0033,1.3044,3.6923,5.9076,1.8147,4.2045,0.1294,0.014,2.5773,3.6308,1.9247,0.4617,0.0195,1.001,3.2742,3.5811,2.4596,1.5267,1.3523,1.8241,2.7711,0.5902,3.9893,0.4298,7.2428,0.0552,2.608,0.548,6.4853,0.2785,5.0396,6.2498,2.9748,2.8998,1.6972,0.0042,0.4291,5.7722,5.3381,1.7206,2.9056,7.6714,0.6177,0.5878,1.3771,4.9621,1.0958,2.4963,3.8444,0.3289,4.4797,2.7353,0.627,2.4428,4.0948,2.2107,2.5552,2.282,0.017,0.9084,1.2979,0.0011,6.1105,1.9216,1.6475,4.2057,6.4925,2.5089,3.7612,1.9296,2.1816,4.875,0.28,4.1941,0.0024,3.4443,0.33,0.4496,0.6136,1.0413,4.6893,1.1622,2.2775,2.1346,4.1768,0.0275,8.8032,1.2591,1.9939,5.8107,0.3052,4.4649,0.9355,5.0561,0.0063,6.6341,0.7953,0.4093,5.0177,6.0023,1.2873,1.608,6.1421,5.1031,0.4955,3.5241,2.2572,5.4305,0.0593,1.7506,0.8269,1.637,3.5047,2.2111,4.0875,0.0504,5.3913,4.3755,3.4486,2.2005,2.743,1.9787,7.9135,0.4378,3.1689,3.592,6.2342,1.3305,9.3321,0.4592,0.003,2.2027,5.0069,1.4912,7.572,5.0476,1.2264,4.3934,2.608,2.1869,5.1346,0.0822,3.2261,7.2598,2.9488,2.032,4.0329,1.3247,3.4429,0.665,2.8119,1.235,0.3858,0.5853]}

However, in recent months, there has been talk of an impending graduation of college-age youth.\nThe Republican tax plan would eliminate the deduction for student loans. That would make the tax bill appear much bigger for Americans, but wouldn\u2019t reduce the level of spending on college by much, according to several experts, who expect a more significant effect to come at the end of the decade as the value of student loans increases.\nThe Tax Policy Center estimates the deduction would cost the government $44 billion annually. To be conservative, it would not include $32 billion in additional spending that would be required to repay the loans, said Stephen M. Deuten of the Tax Policy Center.\nStill, according to a congressional budget officer, the value of student loans has increased much more quickly than the value of federal bonds; a report from the Office of Management and Budget said that over the last decade, the value of student loans has more than doubled, while the value of federal debt declined and has now stabilized near the end of the decade.\nStudent-funded colleges and universities are struggling. The private sector has cut $2.4 billion in tuition and fees in recent years.

With the official announcement, the Congressional Republican Commission, which was created in 2010 to coordinate GOP policies, will be replaced by the new group. The Republican committee also said it will work in conjunction with the House of Representatives GOP leadership and will coordinate with the Senate Republican leaders. The Republican committee will be formed for a one-year period with the goal of creating an organization that will complement the Republican Conference of the Legislatures. \u201cWe will take an active role in developing Republican legislative policy. We will work with Republicans from all political party lines to draft, modify and pass legislation that will strengthen the security of our country... improve social programs... improve tax policies... and protect our environment,\u201d the new committee said in a statement. The GOP congressional committee said that it will begin its first meetings next week.

Morocco","text":"South Africa and Morocco will resume diplomatic ties more than a decade after Morocco withdrew its ambassador from Pretoria, South African President Jacob Zuma said in a newspaper interview published on Sunday. Morocco's ambassador in Johannesburg, Abdessalam Badis, was replaced last February after he refused the kingdom's demands for an apology for a series of Islamist attacks that began on the front pages of foreign newspapers as a result of the killing of a French priest.\nIn the interview, Zuma also said that his government plans to reopen the political dialogue between the government and the opposition.\nThe United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay said that she was \"very concerned that in the midst of this national dialogue a few key questions on the role of religious leaders have not been addressed.\"\nPresident Jacob Zuma has been widely criticised for his administration\u2019s handling of the issue with the country\u2019s Muslim minority, who were among the first targets as the country emerged from almost three decades of racially segregated government. In an interview for The Sunday Times, Zuma denied using the term \u201cterrorism\u201d, saying, \u201cIn my experience, terrorism in general, or terrorism within any country, needs two things: resources, and motivation. For the South African context, neither resource nor motivation are there.\u201d\nMr Zuma reiterated that the government \u201chas a comprehensive anti-terrorism agenda\u201d and called on religious institutions to \u201cshow a little more empathy when addressing these people in the city, not as though they are a terrorist threat\u201d. He added that the government has opened a national dialogue with leaders of the Muslim minority to encourage them to \u201caddress their grievances\u201d.\nIn response, the Muslim Council of South Africa (MOSA) warned that the government\u2019s anti-terrorism strategy \u201chas unleashed an army of police and specialists in various areas and the police have been targeting the Muslim community at will with the support of special forces and the media\u201d.\nMOSA added that the recent attacks in Johannesburg are part of \u201canother step to force the Muslim community to accept the government\u2019s anti-terrorist policies\u201d, after the government declared a state of emergency and the military was called in for security reasons.","token_len":467,"entropy":[8.1474,3.165,7.0039,5.5125,7.1307,3.5889,2.0513,7.7141,0.481,0.7602,2.4994,0.433,5.621,3.1466,1.3269,1.6058,1.2611,4.5551,0.0002,2.3743,2.4764,3.9224,1.5473,0.3291,0.0026,0.0,0.4672,2.5085,0.5259,6.6671,0.1227,2.9771,1.1941,1.8268,0.0869,8.0775,1.5664,1.9891,2.9656,2.124,0.0,0.8484,5.6451,6.6706,3.4173,7.0141,5.962,0.5417,2.1367,3.3681,3.9028,5.8266,2.5988,2.2018,3.0275,5.1431,7.4085,0.0569,3.0519,0.8859,2.4506,1.9635,2.0835,2.6642,4.7038,0.0004,7.5325,0.8877,2.6561,5.3701,2.9219,2.6809,7.5156,1.8408,0.1787,6.5057,0.9464,5.1597,2.9629,0.897,0.0345,1.1326,4.2173,0.0681,1.6095,3.2445,4.4254,1.5947,0.5124,15.7282,2.0877,2.8863,0.385,1.0904,0.0043,2.2337,1.5984,1.1428,3.2655,1.417,4.8518,0.0647,4.3912,1.5196,6.1101,1.7971,1.0156,1.1174,4.1742,0.5008,1.0254,1.0736,1.8508,0.7172,2.1014,4.591,1.2399,6.4214,0.0193,0.0251,4.9974,0.0821,0.026,0.2028,0.0036,1.6976,3.9676,0.1348,0.0003,0.0006,4.4185,2.2399,3.4083,1.7504,1.5248,2.817,0.7724,2.2868,4.1821,1.2734,4.502,0.0006,1.7107,8.0957,1.8532,4.6774,4.1466,4.5115,4.2061,6.0497,1.2237,4.3647,0.1189,4.5548,4.2686,2.1018,2.926,0.1383,2.0039,1.482,0.2808,5.8435,1.0637,0.0123,0.0065,3.3341,2.3333,4.9192,1.9662,0.3687,1.1814,6.2958,18.3671,7.6085,5.3544,2.4353,0.0028,0.6589,3.5295,5.1602,1.7856,4.336,5.9858,0.2308,0.172,3.4716,2.0923,1.3036,2.3523,4.1923,4.4339,0.4677,1.2785,5.4868,6.6307,1.7552,2.4174,4.6698,0.1832,8.2679,2.4223,0.2827,0.0216,9.7693,2.1635,3.2488,1.2874,3.916,3.2091,0.7017,5.3153,2.204,2.7341,0.2808,0.9628,0.5011,0.0021,4.3358,5.5174,1.2329,1.0979,10.0283,5.7602,6.5996,0.2018,7.8736,2.4219,1.8837,3.0611,8.1302,1.3039,5.6625,2.509,4.1971,0.5408,4.2338,3.7978,2.6302,2.4612,3.915,2.9109,4.5892,4.0464,3.5949,0.8983,6.055,7.7554,2.0615,0.5649,8.3018,2.1894,0.4282,6.2842,0.7048,4.9522,2.26,6.1526,0.2465,6.0357,0.2582,6.6303,7.1463,2.2891,0.0311,2.4488,5.245,1.0624,5.8861,6.2645,0.4366,5.9705,0.8772,0.0014,5.5976,1.2856,1.8161,1.9873,8.1653,1.105,2.0335,2.3856,5.8414,5.5308,0.0175,0.3556,4.3762,1.6646,3.2586,0.9411,3.8343,0.9641,6.7488,4.3882,0.7645,10.3566,0.1772,6.3086,3.8311,5.8677,1.9465,4.2128,5.0345,3.854,4.5856,7.3337,3.1933,1.6887,6.6419,3.1309,4.4661,4.1194,5.6135,0.5271,1.0695,3.6164,4.1599,2.8786,2.8184,0.9896,1.6037,2.5015,2.3963,0.4183,1.3737,1.3709,2.2172,5.8146,2.2007,4.4776,0.3695,1.2832,5.7522,1.0416,1.4679,1.2866,3.3111,2.873,4.9446,1.2617,0.0492,7.9192,0.0678,4.6701,1.8845,2.038,1.5501,0.4632,0.4713,0.2419,2.7902,3.4474,1.9126,2.0251,5.1186,3.4513,0.0782,0.186,0.0388,0.9204,1.7893,9.5879,1.4079,0.3211,5.4101,0.7963,1.3574,1.8645,4.5531,1.6718,0.025,4.6684,0.0017,1.0294,2.2061,2.3699,0.193,2.1508,7.8354,2.4097,5.107,0.0862,6.6985,1.2338,9.8099,2.6843,6.4548,2.1248,3.3593,4.0809,3.2715,2.044,1.6905,6.5529,2.6399,2.0297,0.4136,4.5278,4.257,4.4004,3.1201,5.1071,0.0388,5.237,0.3235,2.2916,2.8987,4.6184,4.6754,0.5083,0.2828,0.5586,3.818,0.0247,0.0061,4.6635,0.1765,1.1315,5.2622,1.5757,1.6487,1.8166,0.0001,3.6412,2.9966,0.0148,7.688,0.0674,5.826,5.265,3.2891,7.0801,0.6844,3.382,0.1738,0.3765,3.7489,1.2159,1.481,2.3147,0.1998,0.0266,3.4828,0.0014,3.0872,3.1711,1.3744,0.2003,2.4142,5.6753,1.4566,2.5286,4.7958,1.6067,0.9384,0.0072,0.0158,2.7102,3.2567,4.7177,3.9631,4.4721,0.2143,3.2813,2.8948,2.8963,0.3336]}

Nasrala says the massive vote count showed him winning the Nov. 24 election by a large margin but the official totals placed Trump well ahead. The Honduran government has insisted the vote tallies are legal.\nPresidential elections in the United States and other countries across the globe have seen increasing participation over the years, and in many cases the turnout has surpassed even what they were a generation or two ago. But, the most recent presidential elections in the U.S. saw the highest participation and turnout in U.S. history, both in terms of voter numbers and their geographical spread, according to a new report on the topic from the Pew Research Center. The report, prepared by Pew, looked at the percentage vote count in each U.S. election from 1860 to the present. The report found that U.S. voting rates increased in the late 19th century, especially after the civil rights revolution and Voting Rights Act\u2019s passage. Pew\u2019s data shows a continuous growth in the Voter Turnout Average in the last 100 years. As a percentage of the total number of votes cast, Voter Turnout Average has climbed from 35 percent in 1860 to 64 percent in 2018, the most recent election.\nWhat you must know about the Nov. 6, 2020 Presidential election Results in the United States. According to a CNN poll released on Wednesday evening, Former Vice President Joe Biden has been leading the incumbent President Donald Trump by at least 15 points and his campaign is trying to keep it that way. However, the CNN polls were based on votes cast in the 2020 Presidential elections on, before, and on Election Day. So, the CNN poll is a snapshot of the results of this election on the night of election. You must know here, it is expected that Biden will keep it close with Trump according to the CNN poll. For Biden, he could gain some ground over Trump if the margin holds on. In October, after the CNN polls showed Trump leading Biden in the race, a number of prominent Democrats said they were not expecting Biden to even come close to beating Trump again.","token_len":467,"entropy":[8.1749,2.6476,9.0379,2.6939,1.0122,4.6949,6.5397,1.7917,0.1317,1.1869,3.5279,1.8687,2.2305,4.0743,0.7356,3.4132,4.2794,2.885,0.0643,7.1375,6.335,2.5684,2.7398,0.0947,0.0448,4.4336,9.064,0.735,8.1492,0.0036,6.6598,1.5609,0.1456,4.5265,0.9399,2.0284,1.6524,7.5997,0.9621,4.3075,0.8467,5.9861,7.4282,1.0107,4.4438,15.1682,0.3526,5.6793,2.2261,7.2507,3.6403,3.3949,3.6968,4.7952,3.4541,1.7965,4.7707,0.0003,3.0743,1.4023,1.8672,1.5599,3.0575,0.042,3.4251,4.0144,5.6868,7.3442,7.466,7.3045,6.7078,0.9702,1.6645,3.2909,6.9618,0.0097,2.9291,1.7077,4.7054,1.7805,2.2386,6.4232,0.0002,1.719,6.4026,1.6605,0.8717,21.7563,2.9339,2.1702,1.6871,1.9043,2.1401,0.003,2.7553,2.7129,1.4123,6.2196,0.9202,1.7164,2.0836,3.4715,6.8236,5.0276,4.9403,0.1423,2.9062,1.2101,2.1554,3.038,2.0119,0.4566,2.6763,3.0877,0.7702,4.8248,5.5125,3.9941,5.1254,1.8106,3.9791,3.4188,5.6887,0.2462,0.076,0.2466,2.5177,4.8578,3.6647,5.0066,0.7795,3.6217,2.3071,1.0465,1.6676,2.8297,0.0003,0.0034,0.128,3.7389,2.7268,4.4619,3.8252,4.903,1.3042,1.3992,2.9618,0.0004,0.0012,0.0824,0.0292,1.0872,6.1524,1.304,4.4224,0.0007,4.0186,5.1871,0.2269,4.1644,6.8122,4.1505,2.3872,1.2323,0.0011,1.8925,2.1916,1.9396,4.1359,1.331,5.472,2.0108,0.9048,1.747,0.1534,0.0131,0.1926,2.3338,2.3473,1.6141,6.8791,0.4915,2.805,2.1705,3.9996,0.0815,1.6832,4.4387,7.9348,4.0495,1.2136,2.9457,3.371,0.0003,0.0007,0.0185,3.7487,1.4978,6.5103,0.3403,4.4092,0.9039,1.0723,1.9149,2.2527,1.7427,0.3948,5.2754,0.0003,0.0006,0.0268,3.7723,4.2741,3.4564,2.4952,1.6105,3.3767,1.7506,0.0037,0.14,1.2198,4.5466,2.8466,0.669,4.3017,0.996,5.1374,1.8661,9.2804,0.0094,0.0214,16.2324,8.376,4.7946,2.1878,0.9987,6.4583,9.8692,0.3784,2.9215,2.7851,2.0294,3.3822,7.8602,3.7623,0.4207,1.1078,10.9628,2.2336,0.0039,7.3745,2.6071,0.5002,2.8443,4.0977,0.0202,1.0448,4.8978,1.7017,3.7056,0.0506,0.4629,1.621,3.2363,0.0349,1.906,0.133,0.9652,5.6564,0.0092,0.0049,0.8178,2.3924,4.1628,1.1265,4.9542,1.295,0.1904,2.0567,0.1585,4.1894,0.0512,0.4508,5.5397,1.6273,2.1679,3.0414,0.1002,3.7974,1.6142,1.0742,5.6947,5.1026,5.0535,0.2669,0.9628,1.21,7.1153,0.0017,2.1699,2.8856,5.7244,2.9624,1.7648,5.7635,3.8446,1.9296,2.305,0.0017,2.7277,7.139,0.0016,2.9273,4.3694,2.1503,1.7843,1.2997,3.2018,3.427,0.0889,11.6373,3.478,0.0248,1.8126,0.0004,2.7113,2.8879,1.8825,1.6041,7.2216,3.1916,2.8846,0.0255,1.1507,5.0372,0.0311,3.6061,0.5549,3.8034,4.5462,3.9023,1.3869,4.6602,0.0552,3.9463,3.4119,1.0965,0.0229,0.5381,5.0326,0.0244,1.7358,3.5954,5.9894,3.1542,3.5099,0.1124,7.3327,0.4454,1.2259,1.6702,9.5174,1.7127,2.8727,5.3586,7.4068,6.3907,1.7434,1.8447,6.0536,2.6982,0.0348,0.7139,4.7713,1.0567,2.0694,2.7512,0.5278,2.1128,2.7119,2.8288,0.4075,1.0689,2.8747,1.3691,4.182,0.8759,4.7188,1.9253,3.5034,0.4669,4.1999,6.3441,4.9095,3.3192,3.3745,7.0462,2.7669,4.989,1.2558,7.5713,0.9216,3.6258,0.8381,6.423,3.8919,2.4938,4.2537,1.3756,7.6427,0.0047,1.0448,0.7163,0.2593,0.465,5.6341,6.0048,0.7953,3.5371,4.8299,5.3345,3.3079,1.3025,3.7199,1.4797,2.6879,2.1135,5.8496,5.7804,3.5744,5.6633,3.24,6.1233,0.4082,4.2747,1.7012,5.3095,3.698,2.2084,1.4529,1.0266,2.7657,2.9266,0.822,3.8961,1.0599,3.7814,3.6568,0.0034,3.751,1.3353,3.1884,0.6672,1.4983,3.3579,4.4612,2.188,0.1046,5.5766,3.9018,0.1993,0.2596,3.182,0.533,6.4542,0.4514]}

It was the first trip to the former military stronghold in decades.\nIn fact the visit to the holy site - where the world s oldest peace treaty and Buddhist scriptures are recorded - was part of his broader mission in Buddhist-majority Asia to highlight the need to address violence, foster tolerance, and respect diversity, a source close to the pope told the Wall Street Journal.\nPope Francis is considering the launch of a global war on poverty in the face of growing unease inside the Vatican about the pace of change, a person close to the pope told Reuters.\nOn Sunday, after speaking before the Holy See Foundation Institute for Political and Ecclesiastical Studies, the top leader of the Roman Catholic Church said that an international war on poverty, which he said should focus on agriculture, education, health, and access to land, should be begun before the end of this year.\nThe source who requested anonymity also expressed concerns about the increasing clutter of the Vatican administration.

World Bank Group in Washington, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin revealed that the United States will provide nearly $100 million in direct financial assistance to Iraq in the next two years.\nIn a meeting with the International Monetary Fund in Washington, Mnuchin said that the United States would also provide direct assistance in infrastructure for private sector development and foreign investment, he added.\nMr Mnuchin's announcement comes days after Trump called on the World Bank to slash $1 billion from its $1 billion Iraq rebuilding loan programme. The World Bank has rejected the request while Mr Mnuchin said the White House\u2019s position is that Iraq has shown it is capable of managing its budget through 2018.\nThe U.S. is the top donor to Iraq, but it has pulled out of its coalition forces in the conflict against Islamic State and has been criticised for its inability to fill the gaps left by the withdrawal of most foreign troops and diplomats.\nWith millions of jobless and millions of hungry, the country would be remiss, and its leaders would be short on credibility and popularity, to not work to meet the basic needs of millions.\nIn an interview with the BBC, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also expressed his regret over the Iraq conflict and the US decision to leave Iraq. He said, \"US presence can also be a guarantee against a recurrence of violent extremism.\"\n\u201cThey are a partner in the fight against terrorism. They are indispensable in regional instability in the wake of the American withdrawal. But I hope that they are also ready to meet the challenge of the present. For the long-term peace and stability in the region, they need to do a lot more than merely speak about their commitment.\u201d\nSince the US military left Iraq, the battle against Islamic State has worsened with the rise of the country\u2019s Kurdish nationalist rival, the Iranian-backed Kurdistan Workers' Party, which now accounts for about a quarter of the country\u2019s parliament and its militias, are taking on the forces of coalition partners in southern Iraq.","token_len":468,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,1.9058,3.9264,0.0094,4.2959,5.1143,3.6684,0.4993,6.8025,0.6596,0.0075,1.6297,5.5153,4.2594,0.0125,8.6145,4.8437,1.5987,0.0073,10.2067,2.3105,7.9572,0.328,1.7961,2.3287,2.3403,1.3757,3.3581,3.8212,6.3822,8.315,3.6349,9.34,0.8136,6.0299,1.7518,1.7622,0.1201,0.0759,22.556,0.1745,1.7993,2.3369,1.7582,9.2872,0.8356,0.863,2.4137,0.0013,1.6324,0.2156,5.9277,5.9812,6.9213,2.667,2.4059,0.357,4.4908,1.0392,4.796,0.4631,0.6842,0.0458,0.0,6.4974,1.0779,0.8769,1.4618,0.0108,2.0603,2.6916,4.3159,0.1663,3.4658,0.8763,1.3022,4.7983,4.2335,0.7774,0.287,0.4552,1.893,1.1024,1.728,1.9436,0.1555,1.0534,0.4635,3.2318,1.3901,4.1273,0.4384,2.0916,5.7082,0.6993,0.0005,2.7789,2.2535,0.4903,0.8947,0.0003,1.0642,1.0528,1.0039,0.8008,0.0048,1.8257,2.5906,1.0719,5.0953,1.501,2.3326,6.2001,4.319,7.8179,2.0762,3.8245,2.2326,5.7536,1.4471,1.9819,7.0496,1.5734,0.1883,0.2293,5.2875,4.8575,0.0004,2.4591,1.6011,1.2324,3.4539,0.1597,2.6583,3.905,1.8617,0.985,4.1043,0.0196,0.3339,5.3254,2.9212,1.7499,1.0645,0.8015,0.6078,2.515,2.1658,1.6567,7.1035,9.4944,6.1446,4.6578,0.9326,2.2581,2.9219,0.0046,1.9125,5.4918,1.0589,2.6295,6.9882,3.6075,1.6451,0.0007,1.3873,1.5466,4.9414,0.0006,17.2374,8.541,0.9655,4.4519,1.9938,1.435,3.6882,3.0462,5.3589,2.9932,1.1065,2.1477,0.0348,4.8697,0.6829,3.5233,4.699,8.3433,0.5904,0.1839,1.6686,3.1613,0.0008,0.1571,0.0923,2.4301,3.0849,4.0334,1.0485,0.2315,1.2188,1.4326,2.6353,1.8873,1.2627,6.6117,0.4528,0.3533,3.0314,5.3884,5.3049,1.505,1.6585,4.3926,4.5811,0.424,0.0021,3.1626,1.3691,2.2269,4.9966,0.5039,1.8692,4.0049,0.0038,6.928,1.8636,2.3935,1.6696,0.179,0.8649,3.2187,0.3359,5.2473,3.9885,0.8153,2.9446,6.7999,0.5879,0.4185,5.0364,6.6968,0.189,9.3238,0.5046,1.5981,2.9578,0.6709,7.5451,1.7213,1.1751,2.3519,5.6643,1.3473,8.5913,1.5899,4.2612,3.5907,3.354,2.6024,1.3982,1.5819,5.5914,2.8208,7.838,2.6386,8.6886,1.0482,6.2415,6.2466,6.5835,3.4456,5.0473,0.966,5.4978,0.1629,0.1419,5.7287,2.8364,0.4287,3.0046,2.506,0.8186,0.5589,1.7333,2.8877,0.8121,7.4303,1.6081,0.031,7.0589,0.0031,0.0266,0.0004,3.5022,3.3625,1.8797,4.3483,1.6319,0.6653,6.2471,6.0055,1.5633,2.7391,4.3797,2.3807,0.2996,3.7606,2.8727,0.8818,2.4764,0.4035,3.1757,0.3564,7.2692,7.6881,5.411,5.7095,1.3091,1.841,8.1877,3.8004,2.4507,5.6312,0.0406,0.1791,5.8648,2.7026,1.766,0.3032,8.7129,6.1092,10.2524,1.6686,3.7145,6.1476,1.3522,1.5037,1.3849,0.199,0.6941,1.7361,2.1035,1.1403,5.868,2.3459,7.648,6.3531,4.2412,0.7358,6.626,0.0017,0.7152,5.5718,1.6973,1.4091,2.6899,3.9371,3.4222,0.8376,2.1514,2.223,2.2972,5.439,0.3467,5.0219,0.7646,3.3119,0.5103,2.119,5.4933,3.8734,5.2095,2.0875,4.4359,1.1951,0.0369,6.4727,1.5073,0.7759,2.6944,1.611,0.4757,0.53,1.6751,3.6557,0.5829,3.8658,3.5837,0.7287,1.1601,1.1791,4.908,6.7729,2.4927,3.3014,4.3057,2.4031,4.1799,5.7864,0.5866,6.0715,1.1541,2.673,3.8612,4.9818,0.3899,1.7857,1.3357,7.9878,0.9367,0.3684,0.0013,0.2027,5.9232,4.0557,1.4708,3.2392,0.0823,1.807,7.1746,11.5987,1.27,1.5861,2.5486,7.0035,8.2788,1.0474,0.5425,9.0906,0.5246,0.0873,1.2165,0.0861,0.4665,0.0154,1.7493,1.1068,4.3815,6.4105,0.0025,2.4502,2.551,0.8466,0.0126,0.9525,0.6234,1.8821,0.1393,0.0151,4.9061,2.4266,3.8542,6.2155,2.5065,7.3696,4.8172,2.7752,1.2238,5.1415,0.2864,8.4938,4.0928,2.5103,5.8823,0.454,0.4506]}

This is not a standard answer that is always provided by border service or airports. The rules for issue and use of passports differ depending on the country where you are and the passport itself.

The president has insisted only that the government stop spending money to block the expansion of insurance for an estimated 100 million people who had health benefits through the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and he demanded that Ryan not talk to reporters about the possibility of closing the government, which would happen if lawmakers pass a Republican bill before the government shutters.\nPresident Trump speaks to the media on Capitol Hill prior to the start of a joint session of Congress, Monday, January 27, 2020. (Official White House Photo by Drew Angerer)\nThe Trump administration wants to shut down the federal government for the first time since the U.S. Civil War by making it so difficult to obtain some forms of government services that the federal health insurance that is legally required for people under the Affordable Care Act will not extend to children under the age of 19, their parents or their legally obligated guardians, as long as they are still eligible for health benefits.\nWhen asked on Tuesday if he believes House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and President Obama know the full scope of the threat to the health care of Americans, Trump said, \u201cThey know who you are, I believe. I believe this is an attempt of the left to take over, as what they always have done, take over our country. I will tell you that, and I also know who you are. \u201d","token_len":469,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,2.6667,7.7097,1.263,1.9023,5.716,5.198,5.6884,0.9675,6.7869,2.1123,0.322,5.7222,3.3005,2.0923,0.2744,7.5812,2.3964,4.3825,4.4134,0.4312,1.9573,5.8559,7.8427,5.3314,0.6232,1.4829,3.1642,2.7292,1.6287,0.5893,2.104,6.4411,4.3291,1.3008,0.7659,4.3248,1.8911,0.1846,0.1406,18.8007,8.3242,9.0895,1.8965,2.7601,4.061,1.8404,2.6024,2.9873,6.1223,0.0582,6.7058,2.3203,4.6248,0.1015,1.471,1.594,3.051,0.7333,3.3515,3.3331,7.4683,9.1179,2.1639,1.2091,1.3127,1.687,2.3598,1.5424,0.0034,0.5082,0.4474,7.4875,11.4662,6.9009,2.8792,5.2913,2.0164,1.723,4.6415,0.3779,4.227,6.7445,3.186,3.4938,0.9361,6.5725,0.3714,0.7813,7.2707,2.0293,4.9472,6.2794,1.3762,3.4507,1.9695,3.7304,3.0854,3.9329,5.8753,9.066,0.0216,7.5738,1.296,1.4474,2.2448,1.5244,0.3332,5.7127,3.5724,0.012,2.1594,0.4715,2.544,5.0049,2.3308,1.8763,0.3679,3.7772,0.9379,2.9,0.29,4.131,3.6101,1.5268,0.8296,4.9745,1.7762,3.0728,16.9172,5.1351,0.1779,2.1867,5.6649,0.3798,3.1929,2.2997,0.699,6.8525,3.7448,0.457,4.6471,5.135,4.2549,4.7143,1.9163,3.6371,0.0463,0.0872,6.5747,7.3228,1.7792,10.617,6.0624,1.4665,4.9155,1.3162,3.5669,0.1461,0.8806,2.6054,0.0945,1.5192,2.9576,0.0383,1.3314,0.1745,5.0834,5.3284,1.2517,4.774,4.3317,1.5025,0.0028,0.0266,0.8639,4.4715,5.761,4.0044,0.1502,0.4314,5.2659,1.1359,0.3275,1.7592,6.6094,1.0407,2.08,1.2095,5.1904,1.8226,0.3694,2.2447,2.1189,3.1191,2.7279,1.3051,3.9056,6.335,0.5103,1.7908,3.5519,6.3896,3.5623,1.0526,2.849,6.2291,1.7694,5.6906,0.1066,4.8421,3.7906,6.7977,0.4584,4.1166,0.2012,0.6532,3.0923,4.273,2.8099,4.3159,3.0694,0.8789,1.0314,0.0044,0.0003,1.5171,4.9402,0.0705,0.0734,1.1689,1.4514,3.3155,8.1041,0.9975,2.6476,4.7609,7.0141,1.3046,4.9571,0.6982,1.3891,4.1196,0.3308,7.5852,0.3784,0.211,3.3717,2.1304,2.1899,5.9387,2.0768,4.916,4.7812,1.0946,4.6226,2.0993,4.5221,0.8802,4.7887,4.4279,7.6747,0.7204,0.1962,5.4338,1.0108,3.7759,1.7765,2.5629,0.261,2.6117,1.6375,0.0071,5.9002,0.0021,1.6641,1.6125,0.0012,1.5011,2.8007,1.7438,0.2032,0.0491,2.5675,3.6817,0.0638,4.191,3.1137,0.0115,11.3568,1.1085,0.7107,7.6316,0.2232,0.0008,0.7984,0.3798,5.2824,0.0011,0.0,1.37,0.266,2.2999,4.3087,0.4796,5.0364,0.6026,3.221,0.1242,0.3845,1.8889,0.0314,2.4762,2.5596,0.6816,0.0136,1.0643,1.1886,5.8875,0.0002,0.0019,0.003,2.4459,0.0374,5.0541,5.3905,0.9581,3.8215,5.4284,1.3746,2.6683,7.498,4.4242,0.0013,3.7826,4.0211,2.127,2.2105,1.6815,5.7544,1.9471,8.6987,2.8579,7.2147,0.5331,2.0752,2.3886,3.3966,1.7141,2.5327,0.0016,0.0009,3.3778,1.4898,6.9993,0.6972,7.9435,2.2579,1.6309,0.0347,0.0007,3.5947,1.6782,6.5187,0.6098,1.2009,1.4131,6.5233,5.3121,2.5542,1.295,2.5149,3.2983,0.0035,1.488,1.7583,4.0173,2.9226,0.4082,2.9217,2.7464,1.0565,0.6109,5.552,2.0372,2.9618,1.9139,1.458,0.7904,5.6053,6.0647,6.399,1.4882,0.0025,0.0001,1.8405,4.8499,1.9209,6.208,2.6197,3.5317,2.189,0.028,0.7246,4.1839,1.6642,0.8307,1.7489,0.4643,3.65,2.5459,1.0749,0.2053,0.5681,1.348,8.8637,1.9371,3.6974,2.4545,5.262,4.4713,0.1635,1.721,4.1429,3.725,2.9246,2.0157,1.9373,4.3735,0.9381,3.3103,4.9187,6.0725,1.2855,6.102,0.4682,2.9293,1.9527,3.0482,4.7416,7.6521,1.2024,6.3086,2.4016,0.4343,1.3026,5.5949,0.3701,2.5515,0.9841,0.9824,2.234,3.0043,2.3522,0.0866,2.047,2.1498,2.4545,1.0673,6.7183,2.9901,4.2048,0.8021,0.0677,0.8737,3.3608,4.3637]}
{"prompt":"Federal appeals courts in the states of Washington and Virginia are set to hear arguments this week on the legality of President Donald Trump \u2019 s most recent travel ban , which sharply limits visitors","text":"Federal appeals courts in the states of Washington and Virginia are set to hear arguments this week on the legality of President Donald Trump \u2019 s most recent travel ban, which sharply limits visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries to the U.S. Trump imposed the ban Tuesday after issuing a directive to the government that would require U.S. citizens and permanent residents living abroad to apply for visas for travel to the United States. Trump has described the travel ban as a temporary order that should be suspended if Congress comes to his aid at some point. Several congressional leaders, including Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., say Trump should allow people to travel freely until a legislative solution can be found. The travel ban was issued by acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, who has a day to file a report defending the executive order. In a letter to senators Wednesday afternoon asking them to block the travel ban, Democrats expressed dismay at the timing of the action amid the coronavirus pandemic and said they do not support the action. Democrats have accused Republicans of delaying lawmakers from debating the travel ban and said the ban would have a negative impact on both international trade and the U.S. economy. Wolf released a statement Tuesday claiming the executive order was a temporary measure that should be evaluated after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. He also announced his request to extend the travel ban for 90 days as the nation struggles with economic shutdowns due to COVID-19. \u201d The travel ban cannot serve any legitimate purpose,\u201d the statement reads. \u201d It sends an important signal that the United States does not welcome refugees by taking away the ability for individuals to migrate legally to the United States or to bring their families into the country.\u201d \u201cWhat happens in the coming days will tell, hopefully, if the order will be rescinded \u2014 and if not, whether it is only a temporary suspension \u2014 or if it is a permanent policy,\u201d the statement continued. \u201d At the end of the day, as a lawmaker, I have to ask: Does this help save lives or does it make it that much harder? In my opinion it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Trump said Tuesday he needs the congressional authorization to act outside the U.S. immigration system.","token_len":469,"entropy":[10.2394,2.0568,3.5297,1.9001,3.9432,1.627,3.7989,0.793,4.6768,3.4224,4.5394,0.1025,1.1685,1.4846,2.8498,0.707,1.0232,2.0458,2.5917,0.0439,4.3082,1.3433,0.0072,16.6373,6.1954,7.4546,6.7325,0.9028,1.6691,0.0673,1.9931,0.9094,9.2629,5.2309,5.7759,0.1253,0.2977,0.959,0.0299,0.0001,0.1576,2.4721,1.6926,1.4218,0.0004,0.0011,0.2427,4.4861,7.3038,0.7737,1.3244,7.1291,1.9433,4.1411,0.8809,5.7633,1.625,3.97,3.6204,1.805,3.159,4.8969,5.3652,0.0003,0.0032,0.0017,1.1504,3.6536,1.5597,0.0194,3.9617,4.6588,0.1684,2.7503,0.0828,2.1726,3.7948,2.8814,1.167,0.4453,1.7733,0.0057,0.3987,2.6984,1.9555,5.9597,0.38,1.527,0.1306,0.1153,0.8557,3.9053,3.8323,1.7362,4.3282,0.7844,3.8625,3.3756,2.3015,7.3468,0.8585,2.4764,3.7414,6.777,2.8518,0.0221,0.6204,5.5705,4.6215,3.1945,2.3567,0.176,3.4313,0.0382,0.5041,0.0001,1.315,2.9178,0.0095,0.0395,0.018,2.0348,3.826,0.2686,0.0208,0.1236,0.0442,0.0016,0.005,0.0013,0.004,5.4433,2.895,2.9139,5.647,5.285,1.638,3.3539,2.9878,5.2629,2.6875,4.6257,1.2983,1.7366,0.0315,0.7081,1.0001,2.2961,4.7144,0.0747,1.8791,3.4911,1.6548,6.6396,1.5028,0.0023,0.1428,12.4632,9.8779,5.5026,0.6421,1.86,4.7566,7.7076,2.5725,4.6311,0.6822,2.7191,10.4562,0.5572,2.2087,0.1376,0.6166,4.0444,1.0251,1.8841,0.5204,5.0378,2.9946,2.6917,6.944,1.4314,0.1361,3.8633,0.5154,2.2259,0.1316,0.2651,6.4074,4.4745,3.4071,1.2113,0.5782,4.9484,0.271,0.4006,4.5911,6.864,2.4693,14.1483,9.1792,2.5964,5.5436,0.0044,3.0716,2.3024,1.0221,5.5855,0.0142,2.3415,1.3503,5.5632,0.6186,3.8614,2.2352,3.4825,1.3045,0.0603,5.0267,8.6954,2.1821,5.7187,1.2822,2.5119,0.1538,2.666,3.6231,1.963,4.8388,2.1887,2.7078,2.0314,1.8483,0.2483,0.0678,5.8115,7.015,2.191,0.0917,1.7826,2.0863,0.0002,0.0025,0.0537,0.2408,0.1354,4.1387,5.3877,0.354,0.4765,3.1104,5.9273,1.3621,3.6233,0.0245,1.2704,2.0592,2.969,0.8592,1.3595,1.4943,0.2924,7.8224,4.0352,1.8534,12.7705,11.0649,4.6476,7.5113,3.3069,0.0011,8.9292,0.201,0.3645,2.8559,1.8111,4.563,3.6863,5.7907,1.2963,5.1165,0.7338,2.935,0.0854,1.8719,2.0853,0.0044,4.2698,2.2363,3.64,2.7821,0.8141,4.7707,9.9846,0.265,5.2765,0.0569,10.4147,0.0047,0.697,0.1552,0.4741,8.1375,6.4452,2.2744,3.8747,0.0585,7.2955,6.8677,2.5294,3.0748,0.5159,1.9952,8.5511,2.0344,2.3436,2.507,2.3904,0.1699,3.2489,0.2242,3.2069,6.4226,2.7608,2.4343,1.1825,1.3321,1.1835,2.6408,0.0018,3.5894,0.013,4.0917,2.111,7.2669,5.0274,4.104,3.3098,2.5098,2.3232,3.9734,0.816,6.6727,5.1963,1.1248,0.4643,0.5749,0.0011,4.9888,1.5052,4.7306,1.0356,0.6767,3.5926,0.3054,1.1849,0.7728,2.5582,0.6132,2.7409,5.829,9.5649,4.768,2.3006,1.025,2.4439,0.4986,1.4278,4.4963,5.6946,8.4898,0.068,3.3257,1.6809,4.479,4.7863,0.9108,3.8904,0.0012,6.7978,1.5026,1.8357,3.7037,0.4165,5.2945,1.8767,2.5458,6.7239,2.8367,0.1045,3.7986,4.5431,3.1867,1.6257,1.0014,1.392,3.1785,0.4521,4.4567,3.5201,1.0258,0.6928,1.7282,0.9078,4.3677,0.067,1.9196,0.2646,5.3974,1.6003,2.0919,0.0585,0.3811,0.084,0.0474,4.7846,2.6791,8.6812,0.9129,0.5232,3.0871,1.5227,3.3617,2.9517,3.5017,1.4454,6.71,5.648,0.5704,2.5514,3.4395,0.3297,2.9249,2.5735,6.4038,0.0633,0.9901,2.6479,5.6725,2.7968,2.3613,3.6601,2.9087,7.372,7.2537,0.7147,0.8837,2.1663,0.9635,6.3156,4.3471,2.4258,1.8586,7.2839,2.6767,4.93,2.5706,0.4802,4.5403,8.9771,0.7979,4.46,0.0007,0.0045,0.1816,7.3153,0.3246,1.4265]}

EU ambassador to the","text":"Myanmar must guarantee equal rights for everyone in troubled Rakhine state as talks on repatriation of more than 620,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh gather steam, the new EU ambassador to the country said.\nThe EU is ready to send back a small team of personnel \"to provide assistance, but we want to ensure that there is full respect for the human rights situation, and that the needs of all concerned are fully addressed\", said Tove Svensson, who took up her post on Monday.\nThe new EU ambassador said her primary goal is to make sure that all those currently involved in the repatriation process are treated with due respect.\n\"The EU is ready to work with Myanmar and Bangladesh to find durable solutions that address the concerns of both sides,\" Svensson said.\nThe EU has expressed concerns about delays in the repatriation of the refugees, who were fleeing violence perpetrated by the Myanmar army against the Muslim Rohingya on 8 August last year.\nThe UN has said that up to 760,000 people had fled the violence, but the official figures cited by Bangladesh indicate more than 1.3m had left the state.\nOn the sidelines of the annual summits of world leaders in Myanmar and Bangladesh, both countries have intensified their repatriation efforts, with nearly 900,000 returning to Myanmar since the crisis began in mid-2017.\nSince the army started its crackdown, between 400,000 and 600,000 Rohingya have fled into neighbouring Bangladesh, many of them crossing at the strait of Meghna through the northern Myanmar town of Sittwe.\nSvensson said she hoped to have a positive and constructive dialogue with Myanmar authorities and with \"the Bangladesh side, to see how they can work together to get the work done and ensure that the refugees get back and are safe and secure\".\n\"It's important that the repatriation process is managed carefully and well, and the refugees are safe and return to where they belong,\" she said.\nShe also promised to be \"a strong voice in the international community for human rights and respect of the rule of law in Myanmar and in the whole South-East Asia region\".\nPosted 4 FebFebruary 2021TueTuesday 4 FebFebruary 2021 at 7:49am, updated 4 FebFebruary 2021TueTuesday 4 FebFebruary 2021 at

The Iranian authorities will prosecute the murderers who attacked our university in London, but I wish to stress that neither the Iranian authorities nor the Iranian people will accept such an attack.","token_len":469,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2998,5.3651,3.0152,1.4378,10.183,2.5758,1.9266,3.1976,1.998,3.714,7.9615,0.0008,1.65,0.691,3.0186,7.5128,0.12,4.8395,0.8764,1.109,1.4189,0.7747,5.356,3.0399,1.2903,1.9201,4.2218,0.0005,3.4286,0.3542,2.4706,2.869,4.4999,6.636,1.7844,0.9258,1.75,0.6278,0.125,0.2126,0.0982,0.0181,0.0012,0.0004,0.0098,0.0027,0.0057,0.0146,0.0002,0.0223,0.0037,0.0014,0.0086,0.0009,0.0067,0.0035,0.0005,0.0012,0.0042,0.0002,0.0042,0.0238,0.0131,4.5334,6.1618,0.9168,0.3834,1.3595,0.7932,1.888,0.3303,24.9675,2.9012,1.2534,4.4012,2.4387,2.0294,0.0008,0.002,0.0024,0.0828,1.4259,0.2772,0.1033,0.1393,0.1496,0.0087,0.0937,0.0795,0.0612,0.0065,0.0006,0.0349,0.001,0.025,0.0731,0.0006,0.0292,0.0045,0.007,0.0144,0.0106,0.015,0.0019,0.001,0.0016,0.0011,0.0001,0.0164,0.0469,0.1129,0.3494,0.1117,4.8406,1.9982,1.6758,0.3051,0.2629,9.1606,3.56,1.5211,4.2138,1.0263,2.1653,4.5397,3.0682,1.3186,2.9675,0.8432,4.3161,2.9952,1.216,1.536,1.5478,3.3755,4.6203,0.1268,0.0059,0.0,2.1759,0.0193,0.5359,6.2308,0.725,4.5886,1.4772,1.3112,6.1178,2.1634,7.7707,5.3197,0.4514,2.0306,3.1782,1.1765,0.4597,3.6275,4.7813,2.1285,3.6663,2.7735,0.5509,1.6681,4.4674,0.4844,7.2219,4.9305,1.9176,7.756,2.6768,1.7154,2.6278,5.9353,1.9004,1.7484,2.0568,1.8524,0.0005,0.156,0.017,3.7307,0.8615,2.4354,6.2446,2.1183,4.5411,1.0125,2.4015,5.2448,4.5522,2.9,1.3386,0.9919,0.0856,5.7183,0.0748,4.9998,5.3127,0.3158,5.5265,4.893,6.0118,5.8731,3.0838,4.771,2.0115,0.8096,0.0613,0.0715,0.0062,0.2453,1.8299,2.3652,0.9779,1.0737,5.9124,3.1413,2.6098,1.2,6.2484,2.0927,4.8304,1.0442,0.7227,3.4661,3.3121,5.0019,1.9707,1.022,0.0123,0.1043,0.0186,0.4332,6.4548,4.3368,0.0298,2.621,1.6016,2.4181,4.6485,5.3648,0.8353,8.4028,5.55,3.8603,6.335,1.4955,4.0377,0.732,4.4506,0.6533,2.9145,6.8094,1.0215,6.8633,2.2913,6.2647,6.0908,0.0258,5.5847,0.185,9.4694,6.8996,2.5577,1.5595,1.6298,3.4224,4.2376,0.3264,4.364,1.8428,2.6236,1.2336,3.0524,7.4158,2.6431,13.9839,1.7566,0.3852,3.4496,1.0667,0.6177,2.0406,4.9707,6.1667,0.1599,0.5604,7.3686,2.2572,0.1654,2.8837,3.6658,0.0592,3.1771,4.0786,0.192,1.3951,2.297,5.6119,5.8543,1.0651,2.1455,1.9032,3.6794,4.4011,1.0181,0.3914,0.1656,1.208,1.8535,3.0719,0.7952,4.7944,5.9717,4.765,0.282,0.0488,1.611,0.6481,0.0058,0.6336,0.0477,0.003,0.0022,0.0033,0.0052,0.0081,0.0062,0.0079,0.0147,0.0163,0.003,0.0015,0.0024,0.0026,8.2972,1.5842,0.6903,0.8217,7.3515,6.691,2.3349,4.0714,4.4652,4.2419,3.2885,1.2125,4.3399,0.1089,3.5131,0.0313,0.7696,2.6634,0.1131,0.9694,1.7967,5.3509,0.9885,1.6731,3.2162,1.1542,2.821,0.0,2.8628,0.2776,3.6462,0.9495,3.2089,1.9135,3.2451,2.4358,3.1665,1.6792,0.4986,2.4093,1.502,0.1723,6.8149,2.4028,5.3774,0.1425,1.647,1.0288,2.9403,0.3051,1.2618,5.2151,4.1754,0.6188,2.6961,5.0829,1.2194,0.4466,0.5816,2.5313,3.1816,2.9241,4.3508,1.5952,4.0216,3.2775,0.1896,1.1817,0.8795,2.5913,1.7086,0.3198,0.0224,0.148,0.3553,0.0234,0.0567,0.8361,4.9455,0.0035,1.2591,4.882,5.7399,0.3891,1.1736,3.2743,2.3905,6.6397,2.7566,0.026,1.2033,5.7771,0.0722,2.6361,0.5622,1.4371,3.9333,2.1056,4.5581,6.6706,0.7808,8.451,3.7103,2.6706,7.6461,2.1229,1.968,3.7648,1.3522,2.8733,4.0673,7.0114,1.2218,2.4438,0.2366,5.8252,1.3122,2.7886,0.8354,0.0424,0.5937,2.8437,2.8394,2.0224,4.3252,2.5822,1.4961,2.4164,1.2289]}

Organization of African Unity (OAU), said on Monday. \u201cInterahamwe rebels... attacked the residence through the back of the house. A policeman was killed in the attack,\" said Virunga. \"A neighbour told me the police arrived. He told me that the rebels were armed. He said the house was burned down, burned down completely,\" Virunga said. It said five rebels had fled the scene, and an officer on surveillance was wounded. U.N. peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo said they were investigating. The President\u2019s spokesman, Mr. Fid\u00e8le Otanda, told the BBC on Sunday that the President had moved two members of his cabinet to Butembo to work out security arrangements. He declined to say how many soldiers were deployed. The U.N. says over 600,000 Congolese refugees and displaced people of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda have moved into what the Organization of African Unity described on Monday as a \"catastrophe\" because of the fighting in eastern Congo.\nI would like to know the answer to this question: Is it possible to install Linux on a MacBook Pro 2013 in a way which will enable me to run the software I use on such computers?\nI just got a new MacBook Pro which, as far as I've noticed, is a little bit inferior to the existing MacBook Pro 2014 (a few people here were even complaining about the absence of USB-C in the new machine, saying it was a pity, so I guess it's not a big deal :).","token_len":470,"entropy":[8.473,7.341,0.002,8.6035,6.6142,0.0143,0.8511,2.141,1.3922,0.0732,0.0,2.5224,0.2696,3.6535,2.4437,3.2117,5.7804,4.5943,1.2745,0.9247,3.1756,1.0133,3.4535,7.5286,3.3957,6.8353,0.0375,0.2059,0.0556,12.65,5.8127,4.5292,1.3542,1.9207,0.1567,8.6236,1.9406,0.6886,6.217,7.1606,4.7947,4.6745,2.592,3.0058,4.9438,4.5623,2.4402,5.8839,2.0578,1.6255,3.9113,6.3744,4.8373,6.0385,7.509,3.0848,0.1947,9.8889,7.481,0.2331,1.0134,0.3489,2.4282,3.0515,1.9889,4.8056,6.8493,2.9997,0.4144,2.0592,2.9992,6.004,3.6827,0.3518,6.7767,1.0482,0.8938,5.3663,3.5363,4.848,2.4501,10.7138,6.9219,0.2893,1.6298,7.3031,14.7937,8.9956,0.9498,3.2177,2.4161,2.4618,0.8027,0.9462,3.7516,0.0735,7.6129,7.7391,5.5858,0.4962,1.0273,4.8575,0.2604,0.0007,5.7298,2.0623,3.8092,1.481,5.0724,4.2647,0.9957,0.8468,1.1623,6.5881,1.686,7.9265,4.5518,6.6757,1.4419,2.2375,7.0309,0.898,1.8607,1.8239,1.921,1.0151,1.6806,0.0396,0.0143,0.0495,4.644,0.7961,0.9622,2.1876,8.8058,7.0099,8.7444,1.381,8.1049,3.0942,0.0239,3.639,10.2784,0.3785,0.8311,2.4899,0.0046,0.0556,0.5758,6.2857,2.7033,1.0789,0.8689,1.4919,5.1792,1.2953,0.4033,0.697,1.6405,0.9667,0.1879,3.3225,0.3589,5.4859,0.1307,0.0073,0.0031,5.8219,8.805,3.0156,0.8861,2.3521,6.3557,1.7853,4.1332,3.6889,0.5298,0.6635,2.1915,3.3665,3.1002,0.9076,0.9993,1.3044,0.107,0.5536,4.0749,2.1456,2.2464,0.0047,0.0007,2.1081,3.4334,2.863,6.23,2.6742,3.5512,1.987,3.6141,3.309,5.0185,2.4445,2.6531,0.728,1.31,1.3507,3.1808,2.0189,4.5179,2.582,1.7254,0.6972,2.0075,2.0065,0.576,3.9138,1.0555,2.6177,4.5657,0.6078,4.977,2.5371,2.0932,0.0004,0.0005,0.8563,0.3584,4.2699,3.6586,6.3502,2.6558,2.4546,4.511,1.197,2.3138,1.8087,1.8948,4.3401,3.9489,4.1239,7.7066,2.7687,2.2533,0.7094,4.8481,0.0104,0.0798,0.1619,2.7423,0.5206,2.8618,0.9569,3.9194,0.0118,0.0333,0.0529,2.9763,1.787,1.132,3.5073,2.7154,1.8272,4.9716,0.422,0.0863,0.0026,6.5869,1.1237,6.229,0.1503,5.214,5.6661,6.349,1.2445,9.9192,7.5554,0.3564,2.3533,2.2475,3.3928,2.0338,1.7966,0.3325,1.0998,3.5314,1.4746,6.4229,5.4258,4.9604,0.0594,0.6226,3.292,0.7407,9.0236,0.0019,0.0012,1.3111,4.2505,4.789,4.0273,0.8583,0.7768,1.9776,4.5278,0.1277,1.2802,1.6504,0.5404,3.8198,0.9542,1.809,1.3396,1.886,2.1794,0.0007,0.0385,0.1254,3.8366,4.5188,3.9458,0.4421,0.001,3.4735,0.0001,0.0,3.5625,3.1888,3.4264,1.3156,5.1616,2.8627,2.6443,2.8202,0.0001,0.0007,0.5795,2.2606,1.067,4.3705,1.9133,7.0031,2.4669,4.6729,0.2197,0.228,0.0054,3.9893,6.5267,0.8715,0.0136,0.9953,0.3157,6.3324,0.0843,3.2324,1.798,3.5859,0.2138,1.0146,3.4432,1.6071,2.812,0.3606,0.3335,2.0319,9.2174,4.9618,0.4897,0.0861,4.3557,2.6094,5.8949,0.4175,1.1631,0.5194,1.7477,3.1329,1.7156,1.3385,1.8814,6.9476,10.6392,0.7936,1.266,6.7649,1.807,9.6666,3.7431,1.6726,4.5245,3.3512,2.0518,2.8709,4.231,0.0546,2.0033,2.5284,3.7166,4.1712,2.6496,1.3575,5.9323,2.6232,0.758,1.5442,2.2782,5.4412,3.3828,1.7083,2.0922,0.5664,0.4439,4.4184,4.8574,2.6814,2.6456,0.018,0.0835,5.2219,4.3622,0.1541,1.3808,3.0045,2.9528,1.9745,6.7885,0.4146,1.0323,4.4144,1.1624,0.873,7.2935,3.5889,4.5652,4.7646,5.4252,5.8345,4.8625,5.1526,3.6646,0.5472,0.937,6.5203,0.0353,4.0263,1.7003,0.0457,2.7633,0.6774,2.2699,4.1881,2.4665,5.3433,1.201,1.2603,2.4931,7.7896,3.1484,4.8931,0.9347,3.9265,1.5961,1.0338,1.6935,2.0146,2.2547,0.1305,7.5174,2.3894]}
{"prompt":"Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Tuesday he would use a special order that gives the military sweeping powers to allow political parties to prepare for next year s general election . Major parties","text":"Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Tuesday he would use a special order that gives the military sweeping powers to allow political parties to prepare for next year s general election. Major parties, including the governing United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship, were banned from participating in last month s referendum on proposed amendments to a Constitution that had been drawn up under a military regime. The results of the referendum were declared void before any announcement was made. A poll is expected before the end of next year to determine who would succeed President Thaksin Shinawatra, who has been living in self-exile in Japan for nine years. The political parties have been forbidden, under a law that was approved by the military and signed by parliament on Aug. 23, from holding their own elections, or participating in those of major political opponents. The restrictions have been widely criticised as a further step in efforts to prevent the return of the populist ruling coalition to power. Prayuth, who said he could not give an exact due date for the election, said the special order would expire on Sept. 15. That was a day before a second general election had been declared on Oct. 29, following a military coup during which the Prime Minister and his top rivals were detained. Prayuth said the elections would allow the political opposition to form more than one government. The military imposed a blockade on all political parties in August, preventing them from raising funds and taking physical possession of official property. That ban also prevents any opposition members from attending cabinet meetings and the parliament, where political parties usually have seats. All political parties were ordered to report where they have their office addresses, a move widely seen as a way of forcing them to withdraw from public debate in the run-up to the elections. Thailand s constitutional law says a ruling party must rule for four consecutive terms before the next election, but lawmakers voted to change the law in a referendum last month to allow two terms. The election is due three years after Prayuth, the son of the former king, to take office. Most analysts think it will be more of a showdown between parties vying for supporters who are upset after more than a decade and a half of Thaksin rule.

{"prompt":"After trying for years to stymie the growth of charter schools in Chicago , leaders of its public school teachers \u2019 union are seeking to enlist staff from charter schools in a bid to strengthen","text":"After trying for years to stymie the growth of charter schools in Chicago, leaders of its public school teachers \u2019 union are seeking to enlist staff from charter schools in a bid to strengthen the unions.\nThe union wants to offer part-time staff of Chicago\u2019s charter schools \u2014 even those that are open to students from traditional public charter schools \u2014 the opportunity to get full-time, full-pay positions at the public schools.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that it\u2019s about having people who are willing to put in a day of work to help us strengthen our operations, but it\u2019s actually about having people who are willing to put in a day of work to actually help us,\u201d Chicago Teachers\u2019 Union Executive Director Richard Johnson said Wednesday. \u201cPart time, but with the expectation of being paid for it.\u201d\nHe believes bringing in charter staff would boost the morale of regular employee, who would want to help with the school in order to keep their jobs.\n\u201cIf we can do a quick project together, how about a school project together that would allow a full time staff person to help us get some projects off the ground?\u201d said Johnson.\nAround the state, unions are increasingly leveraging charter education, or charter school operators, in order to increase the pay they offer their members, which has caused some officials to warn about the potential impact on schools serving large racial, ethnic or other underrepresented groups.\nThe move also has generated criticism from some in the education community who say that public schools should take time away from charter schools in order to provide a more effective education to their students.\nChicago, home to the nation\u2019s largest number of charter schools, has seen growing support for charter education since the early 1990s, as the federal government began to allow charter operators to offer their own pay scales to attract teachers.\nIn the past few years, the union\u2019s push for charter school part-time employees has been a response to new funding, which has been increasing the number of part-time positions at existing charter schools, which in turn have created new opportunities for unionized staff.\n\u201cI think we are going to grow at such a rate that more full time teachers will become part time,\u201d Johnson said.","token_len":471,"entropy":[7.4036,3.7874,1.9974,0.2001,7.5982,3.3322,0.0001,1.1428,4.5462,0.068,9.122,0.3076,1.6949,4.7826,0.2974,7.5408,1.3634,6.9891,4.3361,1.488,4.754,15.1899,8.0382,9.187,5.7774,5.9544,0.8656,8.0494,7.5128,0.8676,4.4118,0.2562,1.5693,2.2888,1.421,0.0052,6.274,1.5445,4.964,3.4759,0.697,13.9409,2.6447,4.1708,0.7373,4.7027,7.634,0.1055,0.0159,2.9656,4.2313,3.8172,13.7704,0.7088,3.0256,2.7557,0.224,4.7553,5.5929,2.3181,1.8405,1.9442,4.8073,0.3463,1.8893,2.4114,7.1273,0.7912,5.7202,0.0461,0.4415,2.9565,1.8323,0.053,4.2569,4.5339,0.3183,0.0174,2.603,1.2853,0.0145,5.7227,4.3383,1.4389,1.8865,4.0692,0.8477,1.2019,0.6691,6.1716,5.4825,7.79,8.3054,1.5098,0.2394,1.4195,7.1844,0.3336,4.6806,3.042,0.3263,0.0828,3.3769,4.1291,6.4103,1.2249,1.4293,3.5986,0.074,3.8867,1.5995,2.8287,4.1884,2.4862,0.5298,1.8321,2.1777,4.386,6.5902,0.7902,7.6531,2.0253,1.1154,1.9922,1.4915,0.056,0.1738,3.0949,0.5863,2.1765,0.7899,0.301,0.6897,0.3695,0.0331,2.0258,0.145,1.5919,1.0562,0.3138,0.3987,0.4758,5.1935,0.9815,0.2387,4.2174,5.3816,7.1555,8.2223,1.2716,11.4374,0.1996,3.2335,4.3866,0.1325,5.5396,6.1935,0.6127,3.3774,0.3551,5.5628,0.4576,6.6631,2.9664,2.3983,5.0534,5.201,2.4779,4.8334,1.539,2.9131,1.6062,2.7623,1.4568,0.9125,2.4833,2.7149,0.5462,3.9336,5.6887,7.8832,0.8731,4.2908,3.0171,2.6104,5.1169,1.0601,2.2133,0.1765,7.8684,6.556,2.4323,2.1969,2.9734,3.6777,0.2707,2.9299,3.4164,1.4938,2.3065,6.2055,3.0365,0.049,3.4123,1.8862,0.9109,0.5218,0.3088,2.3767,0.505,3.1821,1.6618,1.7308,3.2403,3.8745,6.2503,7.5833,6.0843,0.9818,5.4386,1.97,2.206,5.1581,2.4013,3.9116,2.7455,2.866,3.7178,3.6118,3.4225,2.3992,1.8601,3.6833,0.449,2.4376,1.2202,3.3136,4.5087,6.2597,3.7271,0.1518,0.0204,1.5149,1.0832,1.015,8.1157,0.6426,0.4049,0.3577,9.2934,1.0109,3.5182,0.4881,4.5573,0.8752,5.1726,7.2817,1.5759,5.3189,3.8033,5.3623,1.5662,1.5939,6.3123,1.2621,3.1764,1.6727,0.0046,3.3784,1.9647,5.322,4.4913,3.7059,2.7686,2.8934,1.7671,2.8519,2.6528,4.5171,1.2585,7.0593,0.3631,5.4545,2.1236,0.9089,1.4435,2.9883,1.506,4.1362,7.074,4.2322,7.071,2.7804,0.3358,2.4993,3.0827,7.2628,0.9128,0.5269,0.2167,0.2423,2.2924,6.2144,3.9363,2.9984,5.0663,1.9968,0.631,1.7317,2.9218,0.4119,2.2227,0.7724,2.2387,1.3046,1.6319,4.2389,0.8337,2.2207,4.9046,5.1351,2.6314,0.0094,2.4194,1.1208,3.0727,0.0591,0.0351,2.3043,2.8381,1.7412,3.0485,1.8491,3.3362,1.582,0.6406,0.3113,0.2552,4.6509,4.7762,5.0996,0.2487,1.411,2.3113,5.5707,0.282,0.7366,0.8488,5.4699,0.0028,0.2702,0.2486,0.2515,1.0467,3.0538,5.5463,4.7312,0.4856,0.4538,2.0205,2.4007,1.1061,3.4912,0.9218,0.0608,0.9092,3.1854,2.002,5.7024,0.1983,1.6135,1.6178,4.605,0.8966,3.4213,0.2044,2.9601,3.6079,2.387,7.0688,5.2714,1.5573,6.324,4.524,0.988,0.5965,2.7569,2.3293,1.7489,1.9763,0.1135,0.0441,1.6134,3.565,6.5649,0.1904,0.0192,5.8404,1.061,1.4683,1.8756,9.035,0.1919,0.0748,2.3362,0.9401,2.2537,4.2243,5.7061,0.034,5.8709,5.6114,3.8298,1.8969,1.0574,2.1983,4.0883,3.1016,0.6543,0.0207,3.1682,0.1072,0.0486,3.469,2.2422,6.0405,0.8555,0.1068,1.6427,3.0946,3.3068,0.0446,1.0697,3.7384,3.2734,2.3347,0.155,3.9367,2.2906,2.3771,1.1802,0.2812,3.671,0.3311,5.9151,1.886,2.4905,2.1656,2.2066,0.1396,6.0986,4.3513,5.3198,0.3286,1.4922,0.5745,5.5924,5.6561,1.2025,2.673,1.4342,2.8792,1.2956,3.14,2.0158,1.3672,0.7148,1.1978,0.3235,0.1703]}

He said a few cases filed against detainees had failed to reach the end result of prosecution as some of the accused had not agreed to a settlement package.\nThe detainees were convicted of illegal enrichment in the oil sector, money laundering, embezzlement of public money or property, abuse of official positions in the public services sector and taking interest rates from banks.\nOfficials claim the operation was meant to thwart a massive financial scheme by billionaire Al Jazeel, a former government minister. Al Jazeel was accused of acquiring billions of dollars in government-owned properties worth hundreds of billions of riyals through fraudulent means.\nAs the number of prisoners kept in jails and prisons across Saudi Arabia keeps rising, Al Assid said some detainees' rights have been infringed upon while those who were tortured during interrogation of their cases had not been compensated for the suffering endured.\nAl Assid said that several prisoners have been held in jail since 2017 after being convicted of crimes without being charged with the allegations made against them in court, which violates the rights of accused individuals and their families.\nThe attorney general also said on Tuesday that there is no rule or legal text under which any person can be held indefinitely.","token_len":472,"entropy":[7.8686,10.0035,8.7248,4.1979,3.005,1.7647,1.8781,10.5062,0.7371,0.3469,3.7203,2.8566,1.5029,4.1123,6.8438,3.8577,0.0022,1.2552,2.4275,4.8275,2.4099,1.3692,2.7934,5.8875,0.1342,11.0371,3.9385,2.0868,2.8222,6.0879,2.3053,3.6303,5.5104,1.5129,3.6625,2.0702,1.2549,0.0007,2.7333,0.0896,4.2618,1.9096,7.5012,0.1066,0.3047,0.2278,17.8599,5.5157,2.3137,4.8542,6.1945,1.0582,2.2688,6.876,1.3838,3.7752,1.5174,4.8397,5.2274,0.531,5.0566,0.9448,6.0996,0.5814,5.425,0.2212,5.849,0.9504,2.722,1.3318,1.3397,4.5476,0.3972,4.058,2.5841,5.8448,8.1456,0.3516,6.9898,0.571,0.7817,2.6311,1.3857,4.6832,0.0292,6.0811,4.5022,5.9999,1.4095,4.5625,1.7249,4.0851,1.4811,1.6047,4.9705,1.7309,2.4296,0.0082,0.0041,4.4446,1.0284,5.2474,0.438,5.2741,2.3923,4.4949,0.0012,8.2123,0.5527,6.0701,0.7177,4.6689,0.5963,5.7801,6.5386,1.3321,1.3981,5.0693,1.6651,5.8336,0.4238,0.1503,0.2114,4.2577,3.9398,5.574,1.7201,3.7157,0.1307,0.1734,0.0698,0.0039,0.0009,3.89,5.5101,0.3917,1.8633,1.0824,2.1262,2.1385,1.98,1.8298,3.1297,1.846,1.7241,1.1315,0.0013,4.7207,1.38,1.3198,0.262,0.0092,0.5022,2.1554,0.3636,5.5839,0.1465,0.463,4.5064,0.3331,1.0655,1.0733,5.2181,1.4446,3.861,0.211,5.9972,5.9345,3.1225,0.7873,0.2634,2.4793,1.4815,3.7984,2.8873,0.7889,3.6683,1.5891,1.272,1.1291,1.9417,1.814,6.7937,3.372,2.7572,1.6157,1.9686,4.8597,0.0306,1.4074,4.6887,2.8445,0.3497,6.0474,6.4495,0.3932,6.4188,3.067,0.623,4.0408,6.9783,0.1254,8.5999,5.6858,5.9327,0.3965,2.6742,0.0504,0.9117,0.0013,0.481,1.247,4.9983,0.0756,0.7033,2.496,1.6457,1.3468,0.1101,2.9308,5.9754,2.0736,3.774,4.3932,6.0511,6.1297,0.1473,4.2505,1.086,2.7781,0.7126,3.9213,3.6632,4.0871,6.6578,1.5597,4.6553,1.4364,4.5928,0.3872,1.8554,1.1134,3.8034,4.4994,1.7743,6.2563,4.5808,2.5334,1.8175,0.6349,3.5105,0.686,3.2725,3.2438,0.075,3.0268,1.2265,5.2177,0.7459,0.1548,1.7446,5.8513,1.6333,6.3644,1.0453,6.0576,4.3184,2.6471,2.2036,3.9101,2.3539,1.7928,3.9371,0.0249,1.2331,3.4658,0.0002,0.0002,0.0358,2.0897,1.6258,3.3315,5.1698,5.7975,0.9848,5.4939,0.0331,3.5716,1.1013,3.0852,0.7782,3.5258,3.6766,5.8152,0.6654,6.426,6.9242,4.9738,3.4988,2.223,0.8844,0.4708,5.6396,7.353,1.4917,5.4316,1.6574,3.5742,0.0337,5.8286,3.2019,4.6455,3.1466,4.9887,2.0127,7.3291,4.7272,5.7885,8.686,3.7899,2.6014,2.0711,2.072,5.2556,0.9532,2.4619,2.8209,0.2929,0.0545,0.0018,2.4036,3.2449,0.4056,7.6121,3.2234,0.244,1.1466,1.2084,4.2247,3.2061,0.8934,3.3232,4.6483,3.1708,0.0058,2.0344,0.0939,0.3217,0.0004,0.018,3.2743,4.2774,3.2492,0.9565,0.3863,5.719,2.2816,5.3998,0.0129,4.4907,6.3472,0.674,3.8442,3.4735,1.3543,4.4945,1.8761,0.001,7.4663,1.0022,0.1707,3.8909,4.429,0.0033,0.1391,2.9142,2.8318,5.5884,2.9412,2.0461,0.3027,5.6997,0.0083,3.3593,4.3924,5.5037,1.953,1.688,6.0127,5.2917,5.2815,6.6631,3.48,5.4711,3.2561,2.4886,0.6889,4.1046,1.6927,2.7988,3.4198,4.3301,1.2151,0.2121,2.7176,0.8602,0.0019,0.3496,2.6639,5.3233,2.9123,2.736,1.0968,2.9595,1.4429,3.178,1.439,8.9736,3.5534,1.5912,2.577,0.3745,2.7235,6.6893,3.0315,0.6501,2.1157,3.6412,6.8644,3.3354,0.4988,0.0256,3.2906,1.4327,2.3165,2.9935,8.4738,1.1073,2.2938,0.0759,4.7855,4.2591,2.076,2.9102,0.5288,0.1819,0.2863,2.0772,7.2138,0.6537,3.7814,0.7586,3.9024,0.2627,0.6279,3.8201,2.6862,1.2722,6.4248,3.478,2.6741,9.0272,6.4626,0.0441,3.6495,3.0115,1.7675,0.4791,1.059,2.6738,3.0945]}

We had to do something and the Red Cross has the right to intervene, like others have done,\" Israel's former Red Cross chief Nitzan Horowitz, was quoted as saying by Ynet on Monday.\nA spokesman for the committee to visit Palestinian prisoners said the video was \"outside the rule of law,\" adding: \"Israel must be held accountable. He can only be a member of the parliament in Israel.\"\nThe director of the Red Cross in Israel, Lior Peled, who is Jewish, said in a statement on Monday that the videos \"feined\" with Israel and it showed that the lawmaker \"does not agree with the values of human life and dignity,\" which are the \"core values of the Red Cross movement.\"\nIn a similar statement, the head of the Palestinian Association of Prisoners' Families in Ramallah and former head of the Committee on Visiting Prisoners, Abu Dughniya, called the lawmaker \"arrogant,\" saying he \"must be called to account and punished according to the law.\"\nDughniya added: \"Our society wants to live in peace and to work together towards a common goal \u2013 to solve our problems. It does not want the occupation or the destruction of houses and fields. The occupation only brings violence. We will not be cowed by those who are using violence under the pretext of human rights so the only solution is the return to the Palestinian Authority, as the only solution to the conflict,\" he said.","token_len":473,"entropy":[7.5775,3.3411,3.1439,3.3486,1.9247,11.6009,3.216,4.5683,2.8228,0.1205,5.7711,1.3004,0.6612,1.4913,5.2232,0.0134,2.2633,4.6753,5.8662,8.099,2.3626,4.8645,2.0606,8.7492,0.312,0.0176,3.7323,3.5217,5.127,3.9818,4.6885,9.9627,0.5311,1.942,7.3604,5.1899,3.678,5.5671,2.709,1.2592,0.4777,4.0565,1.8485,0.148,13.8974,3.2026,3.9727,5.0059,3.7103,1.3281,1.4978,0.0218,6.84,0.0121,0.0,0.8736,0.943,5.5692,2.8924,0.0012,1.1745,5.8622,0.0283,3.9698,3.272,7.2982,0.2806,2.5725,2.3053,0.2449,0.1995,2.4262,1.6912,0.843,1.7087,5.2453,6.2085,1.4486,1.46,2.5444,2.2879,3.3869,3.0942,2.0109,3.0895,6.8118,5.2948,8.2804,1.6057,1.0332,3.5464,4.0949,1.8623,3.0365,0.486,4.6822,5.7793,5.8589,0.1696,0.1989,1.5291,2.9924,4.8522,0.0365,1.7013,8.2416,6.9828,0.6516,2.5724,1.4507,1.371,0.0015,1.6096,0.7235,3.3975,2.5409,0.794,5.4079,8.7444,3.235,4.5633,8.084,2.0675,1.8193,5.3257,2.2448,1.2608,0.0832,0.3845,0.4012,4.5516,2.8812,2.4192,2.0805,0.5309,1.9016,3.6389,1.1141,2.486,0.0026,0.4783,2.3171,0.9831,4.8072,0.8895,3.3381,0.019,2.8596,2.5792,4.4829,1.2018,0.7224,4.9966,3.6818,4.7231,6.4906,0.0248,4.2745,6.6044,1.1476,0.6022,0.2687,1.5562,2.5071,2.0599,3.1181,2.0919,5.8501,0.9041,1.3428,3.185,4.3438,2.9272,1.2928,5.164,2.2813,3.7902,1.239,3.6418,3.6775,5.2313,0.0014,1.9307,4.4276,1.0331,0.0909,3.2152,3.1823,6.4701,6.4104,1.8669,0.7091,1.3539,4.6217,0.2434,6.0164,6.6833,0.0478,1.4043,5.4897,4.7669,0.0433,8.0288,3.8874,5.1658,0.0091,0.1698,0.0298,0.5428,4.2979,1.2134,3.0782,0.5985,0.1561,0.1929,3.9606,2.1777,0.0353,0.3955,6.5068,4.1863,5.6913,2.5838,0.343,1.2117,1.4392,2.1904,0.7772,2.7738,7.3233,0.437,4.9602,0.0529,0.0478,3.0633,1.7015,2.9366,0.0072,3.5744,3.1627,3.1545,2.5288,0.5658,3.0268,5.5019,3.7747,3.2435,2.5405,3.607,3.8134,0.0579,0.8081,4.8317,3.6554,2.6037,1.096,0.1922,1.5632,6.7224,0.2962,0.2761,2.2752,0.0013,1.8488,1.4575,0.2424,5.5112,2.3189,7.5985,3.5141,0.5952,3.838,2.3336,4.6281,0.1738,0.7539,2.6197,0.4739,0.1682,1.6554,0.4513,0.5805,0.9449,5.0861,2.6632,10.4714,11.5335,4.698,5.9117,4.7736,2.7477,5.8025,3.7349,2.8545,1.5896,4.4892,2.5108,4.2309,0.0363,3.7746,0.091,0.865,4.0771,0.4984,5.3487,4.8876,1.3589,2.3477,3.722,3.6572,2.4473,3.0136,2.0111,3.2635,0.5682,0.3091,0.9392,1.3152,0.0026,6.7244,0.3842,0.1594,3.6042,1.3707,5.0301,3.6149,0.9821,1.2897,3.6275,0.0079,0.2339,1.9268,4.4202,0.4217,5.4953,0.0249,1.3799,5.3991,2.4309,4.711,0.0015,5.2735,4.3847,2.252,0.0192,0.22,4.1985,1.9795,8.7117,0.2604,1.1178,0.0034,1.0238,5.419,4.9434,7.1767,3.6193,3.8479,0.4036,2.6209,1.1052,3.9286,1.1493,5.4815,0.0559,0.0121,2.6013,2.0803,1.39,2.1865,4.4023,0.9799,4.6574,2.2541,0.2244,3.0671,2.9949,6.0133,0.0079,0.7429,0.6733,0.4408,0.1805,6.1045,1.0759,0.0043,0.0007,3.2882,1.8123,0.0092,5.4664,4.9109,5.5358,0.7435,3.4929,0.6855,0.8864,1.3516,3.8886,3.9788,1.5061,4.4419,1.5403,3.076,1.2661,4.5577,1.3843,4.3958,3.1719,0.6074,2.0057,2.9614,2.687,0.0283,1.9998,2.9826,3.1788,3.3438,1.3188,5.1019,0.0615,7.7266,1.5166,6.5091,1.5133,2.4112,2.6781,5.3669,4.5009,4.0639,2.2345,2.263,3.421,0.9999,3.1424,6.014,0.0394,0.6996,4.7117,0.2174,2.9069,4.5107,1.3169,8.1465,0.7538,0.7629,0.1027,3.8249,0.0611,8.0336,4.5579,4.2285,1.7682,0.227,2.9474,2.9078,1.9831,1.7313,3.4745,4.797,2.3912,4.0449,2.0422,4.73,0.9645,2.7149,0.7371,3.4189,5.1017,0.3482,0.2238,0.2117]}
{"prompt":"Ireland has made significant progress in talks with Britain on the future of the Northern Irish border , but the sides are not there yet , a spokesman for Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on","text":"Ireland has made significant progress in talks with Britain on the future of the Northern Irish border, but the sides are not there yet, a spokesman for Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday.\nVaradkar told reporters that he met British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday, after the two countries resumed negotiating with a series of face-to-face meetings this weekend. But he cautioned against giving the Northern Irish protocol at the end of the Brexit process any more attention than it deserves.\n\u201cIt has no special status. It is just another agreement on a very complex, and very long-term area that we will have to put into operation once we leave the EU.\u201d\nThe British government has been reluctant to give Ireland the status it wants \u2014 in particular on the legal status of Northern Ireland, where thousands of British immigrants will not be exempted from a UK-wide visa system.\nJohnson had hoped to have reached a deal with Varadkar on the protocol by the end of last month; since the start of the talks in January, the UK government has had to concede the UK has no control of Northern Ireland\u2019s border with Ireland \u2013 although it does have the power to regulate the passage through the Irish Sea. The UK government believes that it would be in breach of the Treaty of Union if it did not give Ireland proper control of its border.\nAs a way of resolving the issue, the UK government would like to give the protocol more rights so that it can override local measures if there is an economic or health emergency in Northern Ireland.\nThe Irish government\u2019s negotiating stance has been more flexible than that of Johnson. As a result, the two sides announced they would resume discussions on Monday and again on Tuesday, but the talks have not yet resulted in a deal.\nIrish Foreign Minister Leo Varadkar has also said the UK government should use its position as coordinator at the European Union to pressure EU member states in favour of the protocol.\n\u201cIf we do not see that some member states are showing enough support for it, then the Union will lose some legitimacy,\u201d Varadkar said during a press conference on Sunday.\nVaradkar met with Johnson on Sunday, and during their talks they discussed whether or not the protocol offered any advantages to Britain relative to other countries in the EU.","token_len":473,"entropy":[5.1855,4.1179,4.191,0.8918,0.6148,9.7096,0.6207,6.662,1.6555,1.8492,2.6309,0.1382,1.2653,4.4026,2.077,0.4627,1.2855,1.7648,1.9349,7.4709,1.4244,2.7916,6.0345,0.0651,1.995,4.1989,2.5916,0.5255,4.4159,0.0022,3.7998,0.0,0.0003,0.0001,0.4104,1.6733,1.8634,0.122,0.1613,23.0391,0.0009,0.0007,3.0527,1.4053,1.2248,2.3415,5.6183,3.9875,1.4738,0.0026,8.8203,0.0018,1.3118,2.9611,2.3856,3.2814,1.7959,1.938,3.0549,5.4063,5.2702,4.1125,2.865,4.8679,0.0005,9.3369,0.0527,0.0323,0.0003,0.0002,1.2349,3.9127,3.4628,0.4237,5.345,1.3385,5.2685,2.5737,4.6932,2.512,6.215,0.5815,12.3959,5.8324,1.5316,3.5994,0.0534,0.4975,7.1676,1.3567,2.7287,2.3493,5.2263,1.4692,0.9896,2.3588,0.3153,0.1729,13.1606,8.1309,7.3658,3.483,5.9564,6.0989,1.6282,3.1601,1.5287,1.1107,3.281,4.1952,6.3377,3.0359,1.9148,3.452,2.5646,3.3592,4.3277,1.283,3.5921,0.9288,0.7062,7.4223,2.8935,2.1191,2.9867,1.3401,0.1066,5.7362,2.3406,4.8984,4.5602,0.9187,2.5224,0.3756,0.5955,1.2206,3.2412,9.0466,1.3376,2.3146,3.3418,0.8838,1.1351,2.0946,3.7726,0.0379,2.8865,5.4188,2.1606,2.6769,1.1757,2.6099,5.2252,3.8904,3.4575,3.626,0.9585,5.7925,0.5834,0.2015,3.1337,0.117,2.1109,3.0365,6.5301,0.092,3.143,4.7333,4.0073,4.1776,0.3593,8.5889,0.2773,3.3433,4.6153,1.6757,1.0548,3.2227,2.2653,1.0974,0.6846,6.3172,3.6618,4.1792,0.8144,2.9313,5.9339,0.9477,0.8303,2.0718,3.2119,0.0002,0.0021,1.8875,1.79,9.9317,1.8772,1.0624,0.2159,0.0009,4.8982,1.5321,5.7636,5.8055,3.5533,3.5038,0.0174,0.7139,1.253,2.7743,3.6645,0.3489,1.6086,3.0237,1.701,0.2031,4.5326,1.7581,5.749,2.9805,4.3604,2.1458,2.0365,4.6725,3.5286,2.3889,0.0481,13.0962,6.6036,6.5005,1.8139,2.1216,1.2617,6.9238,4.1568,1.5544,3.3953,0.5932,1.6637,1.3378,0.0794,5.5941,1.5508,6.3051,4.2778,1.3558,1.8319,2.3399,1.153,3.5246,2.1511,1.917,5.3591,1.1005,3.1516,3.3703,0.7417,3.3335,2.6404,0.0459,1.4272,4.6992,1.2022,6.3326,0.5361,0.4882,1.2898,0.0739,3.5147,1.7991,6.2999,1.9496,0.8855,1.5417,0.9148,1.1128,0.2622,5.139,1.963,6.4132,0.24,4.7572,0.4645,1.5092,0.2074,1.5189,1.3452,0.7222,4.4744,2.7342,0.3035,3.4484,1.825,6.1128,3.2779,6.3002,6.2286,0.4961,0.6852,0.947,6.9898,6.043,7.2122,4.8197,3.5335,0.3748,2.2128,4.6862,1.6485,5.2388,2.2362,2.3745,1.1032,0.0024,0.3945,0.6808,1.7798,2.596,1.0246,11.7485,1.8016,0.1205,4.5144,4.9349,2.0736,0.7585,4.6087,4.7693,1.1346,1.4777,0.2542,3.7453,1.8542,4.43,1.5551,0.4815,0.2889,1.2787,3.3666,0.3898,8.2244,3.3193,0.9039,4.5206,3.2057,0.8136,3.6983,2.7736,4.9695,0.2795,0.4469,1.3162,2.0861,2.3097,2.9423,1.7713,1.5144,1.4063,7.268,0.0584,0.6248,1.3002,0.4433,0.4944,5.4163,2.285,0.3319,1.1992,0.0001,0.0004,0.0019,3.0925,3.944,1.8014,2.3401,1.5395,1.302,3.9629,5.2676,0.9554,3.9666,1.7335,9.042,5.5771,0.4718,2.4201,2.406,0.9938,3.9284,4.2551,1.5135,0.06,4.9253,5.0203,0.0011,2.6007,4.3098,0.4199,0.747,2.5202,0.5278,3.3342,1.8125,2.4425,0.197,4.974,3.5149,6.7811,3.6429,0.1113,1.674,7.4667,5.6911,2.7723,0.9494,2.7742,0.391,1.2928,2.5868,4.5571,1.1667,3.976,3.6588,4.3985,1.8195,5.6428,3.4362,1.4438,0.0005,0.0012,0.608,4.1916,0.5971,2.3122,0.0979,1.2131,2.997,0.2494,0.4699,6.6489,0.0006,0.0005,6.7449,0.7657,1.2726,0.8092,1.1818,1.4391,1.2908,5.6518,2.8445,1.3588,3.0155,1.1639,4.8381,3.1089,0.0037,1.454,3.2726,7.41,2.9744,5.5128,1.258,2.4995,9.465,0.0014,1.9516,2.676,1.4171,0.1566,0.8519,0.6142]}

In the meantime, negotiations on a free trade agreement have not started: the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told an EU finance summit yesterday the UK\u2019s trade negotiation team was only \u201cvery at the beginning of negotiations\u201d over a free trade agreement.\nMrs May\u2019s Cabinet meeting in Downing Street yesterday agreed the Conservative Party, at a meeting of its executive council, had recommended her to retain all her powers, in part to protect her from legal action if MPs backed down on her deal, two officials said.\nOne of those advised the PM that it is \u201cnot a secret\u201d that the Cabinet was \u201cworking on a strategy on the subject,\u201d the officials said.\nHowever, it came as reports emerged that the Labour party\u2019s Brexit policy was to reject any deal agreed to by Theresa May, who has a majority of her own MPs.","token_len":474,"entropy":[6.9938,5.0627,0.0006,8.1012,3.3176,3.1178,7.6516,0.0092,2.6786,1.6269,4.8366,1.0872,1.4771,4.0828,4.5912,2.2874,1.7425,7.9507,2.2132,2.6953,5.3668,5.6496,1.6699,3.5549,5.7987,1.1943,4.9941,2.8155,10.3073,2.6133,3.4907,7.1364,4.4645,3.8512,2.1155,2.0891,18.5089,9.1571,0.829,3.0171,0.4518,0.0133,6.6175,0.4392,0.7588,0.1929,1.3756,4.937,1.8873,0.1478,0.482,18.7214,0.7826,3.6936,4.0679,7.2724,2.3634,1.6923,3.6682,4.8598,5.3082,4.5294,0.0447,0.0083,4.1927,1.3992,1.3625,0.6771,3.2999,5.5309,8.4627,0.6988,1.2755,6.0021,0.008,0.3741,4.8622,1.582,3.0065,5.4826,0.1086,0.58,3.1922,1.112,0.0146,0.0027,3.8212,1.1054,0.3337,1.0841,1.6331,1.4763,5.1487,1.8103,2.485,0.7693,0.4924,0.1685,11.3886,0.003,2.7085,1.326,8.7376,10.4412,0.0064,0.1131,5.34,1.7292,0.7645,5.7644,1.7497,2.4685,3.9974,5.704,1.7218,6.5566,1.3737,14.6206,5.4201,9.0606,1.2617,1.1532,0.9431,1.4042,2.3881,5.1903,0.015,0.1061,2.1451,1.7971,0.3247,0.6721,0.8652,6.0906,2.0158,2.3166,6.801,2.2815,0.3319,4.8165,2.5647,0.1874,5.9115,0.433,3.392,6.1643,1.0915,1.6963,3.7986,1.9554,4.837,3.1915,0.3573,0.0581,1.3327,3.488,3.8644,6.2041,3.2649,6.1078,0.0929,1.5991,0.9431,1.7526,1.1082,2.5471,7.3292,1.4385,0.2453,5.4513,2.534,5.8556,0.5237,6.6917,1.6569,3.7974,2.784,1.0522,4.1717,4.6194,4.6495,2.1984,3.2912,0.4617,4.4392,4.4896,0.9724,3.65,6.1058,4.5526,1.3903,2.0094,3.2588,3.7379,1.1276,0.447,2.9144,4.4919,1.0773,4.956,1.4831,4.1013,2.0251,1.0595,2.2092,0.3753,3.0181,0.1476,4.8943,3.3751,3.7941,0.7424,0.6503,4.4973,5.4237,4.6318,1.7064,0.0001,2.6757,1.2633,2.8362,3.1676,3.9813,13.7173,5.8787,5.2647,0.0805,0.4197,6.9279,2.1044,6.4925,1.2938,2.0433,3.7718,2.2375,2.1898,1.4312,1.4009,4.708,0.1962,4.4684,0.1062,0.9457,1.0901,2.041,2.9616,3.3617,0.9608,1.6932,3.8491,0.9095,7.0188,1.4455,4.3937,4.3135,4.5119,1.7437,0.9258,2.3858,3.0252,5.1094,1.0906,3.2088,2.4754,0.5183,4.2063,4.0124,1.5966,0.862,0.2377,0.0341,1.4464,1.6014,1.02,5.6832,2.2902,5.9705,1.513,2.5313,0.0187,2.369,3.9646,2.7343,8.6729,0.4435,1.1074,5.1796,2.8212,4.2991,1.751,0.6051,0.1108,5.0475,1.5954,2.037,4.7004,0.175,1.0902,3.0609,3.0933,1.9387,7.2201,1.7469,2.4377,7.1475,0.1484,0.0276,4.1817,3.1599,0.0021,0.9706,0.0,0.0,1.7555,5.104,0.9231,4.2013,5.8291,5.0927,4.003,1.3706,3.8081,0.0793,0.0337,3.8813,4.6204,4.7767,2.0248,4.9343,8.9411,0.6826,5.2434,7.6162,1.2644,1.2757,0.7567,2.7577,6.9634,1.1793,6.93,2.2757,1.0323,0.3707,1.0263,0.5892,0.3213,3.2161,0.0036,4.9861,0.059,0.1983,5.8042,2.7375,3.7443,2.9074,0.0242,3.2921,6.6779,3.568,6.6193,1.9056,4.1529,6.4562,2.0868,1.6215,0.8497,3.2763,4.3044,3.7688,0.2629,2.4549,7.5617,5.5371,2.2839,7.0931,6.0948,4.8715,2.9302,2.648,4.6456,3.3105,1.2502,3.0503,2.8002,3.8608,3.5342,2.4479,2.5045,6.9844,4.9481,1.9414,0.7586,2.0472,5.7301,3.2983,7.8334,4.4083,1.5671,0.3412,0.4695,4.7639,1.2382,1.6011,10.036,2.2027,4.0725,2.1298,3.3572,2.7665,6.282,0.1415,2.5315,2.595,5.4656,3.9419,1.148,0.2246,1.5025,4.6821,2.5075,6.0292,0.0456,3.547,0.3856,1.0875,5.9147,2.5034,1.9332,3.7612,1.5493,8.4003,3.6955,2.7715,1.8496,0.3451,0.137,0.5704,3.6606,0.0702,2.9204,5.3868,0.7013,5.8343,0.6465,0.6759,1.433,4.6128,2.8306,4.5492,0.0853,0.0055,3.4211,3.5053,3.0956,3.6864,5.5097,1.4559,1.5647,6.2872,2.5013,0.882,3.1785,0.0026,1.939,2.7625,1.9257,4.2783,0.9263,1.2836,6.0081,1.2558,2.061,1.2314]}

As part of that process, more than one thousand counties are currently at risk; however, experts say those estimates could be an undercount since there is no standard process to determine which markets are most at risk.\nSome insurers are already pulling out of markets, and a final number of those counties will be determined later this week as part of the Affordable Care Act review by the Office of Management and Budget and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n\u201cThe final number is going to probably be in the thousands,\u201d said Thomas Waller, director of policy studies for Health Policy Options. \u201cBut again, that\u2019s just a rough number.\u201d\nThe number may be an undercount. It\u2019s not clear whether insurers \u2014 or the county governing bodies that hire them \u2014 consider the entire population, only those who could purchase insurance through the ACA, or some combination of the two.\nThe number of counties who could lose financial support for health coverage varies by the region. Some groups are looking to states and local governments, including health insurance plans and Medicaid. Others are trying federal legislation to solve the problem.\nAccording to estimates from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, roughly 5 million Americans were not covered by insurance on Jan. 1, and another 18 million were expected to become uninsured in the next six months \u2014 with those numbers continuing to rise.\nBut those numbers are outpaced by the number of counties who are already facing financial instability as insurers begin to scale down operations.\nIn a July 2018 report, the Pew Research Center reported that nearly half of U.S. counties have seen a fall in health insurance rates paid by their insurers in 2017 as opposed to the previous year.\nThere are approximately 24,350 counties in the country, and some 2,000 U.S. counties have faced an alarming drop in health insurance rates for some of their employees since last spring.","token_len":474,"entropy":[9.3775,5.732,0.1167,4.8188,1.2887,3.5417,11.7881,0.0562,0.4498,7.2934,0.102,6.4308,0.0042,0.0016,0.0098,3.8955,2.0356,5.7358,0.1584,0.3834,1.003,3.3669,0.0175,4.4615,0.8399,3.3384,3.8317,3.6964,3.5046,3.0846,7.2417,5.603,0.3076,0.4028,4.2248,1.4437,3.8501,1.8759,5.276,0.2623,0.4101,17.2943,3.0195,1.882,4.016,16.712,9.6264,1.6803,5.6923,2.6637,2.005,6.0723,1.1098,2.4317,0.0039,0.0007,3.9383,0.0564,0.2586,7.6998,2.4997,0.9504,0.1242,1.1256,2.1079,1.0391,1.6907,0.5693,0.4763,0.1023,4.3849,1.0625,2.2163,4.9214,0.028,0.9912,4.2523,1.2224,1.9471,0.5861,0.9856,4.4167,3.7105,0.001,2.5451,1.538,0.0343,4.3133,0.0978,4.9292,4.4355,1.659,1.9869,3.5286,4.0754,0.1249,7.5818,4.8031,0.0189,6.5353,0.9436,3.3663,6.6109,2.8043,1.5505,6.4303,5.6925,0.3809,5.2982,3.6376,1.5093,0.6207,5.6561,5.5182,1.2944,1.6086,2.2368,3.908,1.1582,3.7516,2.0774,0.012,0.5237,0.2749,11.415,2.6109,1.0012,1.6615,2.2398,0.0816,0.2807,4.3067,2.4606,2.2632,3.88,5.5074,5.4113,1.3316,2.8375,0.4315,2.3688,1.0867,6.4892,3.1045,0.3281,2.237,4.0321,2.1024,0.0005,0.8051,4.4626,0.0051,0.0077,4.7705,4.6996,0.2409,3.0583,0.0105,0.2276,0.0053,0.0001,4.3593,0.5985,6.0641,1.3964,0.3005,0.0109,0.0556,0.0004,1.1938,0.0071,0.0003,0.0,0.0596,0.2758,0.6038,5.8477,5.4477,4.7476,3.4464,1.9979,3.4553,6.4885,0.0245,6.7607,0.5189,3.9702,0.3179,2.0681,0.9529,8.5591,6.5382,2.5541,5.5731,7.958,0.9909,0.4255,2.8369,0.0267,2.993,1.6166,1.8616,3.7481,2.1197,8.7166,2.2254,5.7732,0.2602,1.9396,8.6147,0.0691,2.2214,11.4709,2.8378,0.1813,2.4327,1.1332,2.7634,4.1206,1.2635,3.8256,4.3577,0.3264,2.3539,3.6979,4.5646,1.5101,4.531,1.3814,0.0079,2.6379,4.1576,2.1939,0.2408,0.0107,2.3279,2.5786,2.1785,2.3104,6.5797,1.7021,2.2412,7.0736,7.6486,8.9157,1.1362,7.5812,0.3413,0.2003,7.8048,1.9628,5.3364,2.475,3.6982,7.2218,2.6166,1.8766,6.3197,5.8792,1.5577,1.938,1.3293,3.3886,3.0506,1.538,4.4818,1.2202,0.2663,0.9972,0.0882,0.1744,0.6903,2.5519,3.4716,1.0307,0.4492,4.8876,3.0018,0.8663,7.6326,1.455,2.1555,3.8667,1.7939,5.7767,1.9385,4.2301,4.5141,1.3449,2.1812,8.568,2.0113,3.6728,1.1822,8.5395,3.6043,1.2908,1.0881,2.4092,2.7851,5.0744,1.729,2.8847,3.4471,1.8563,2.2258,0.8288,0.4367,3.856,9.4269,4.288,1.3664,7.5926,0.8813,0.9764,1.1329,0.5107,5.8994,0.0039,4.1066,1.1478,0.6115,2.3308,0.0057,4.0861,0.1134,0.2139,0.0479,0.2407,4.1113,4.0171,2.0049,1.4445,3.9391,4.5511,0.8279,0.8198,2.2089,3.6453,2.9546,0.0317,0.0333,0.3321,3.2007,4.8719,5.4887,0.2303,1.1088,6.5518,0.0418,4.6861,0.1868,1.9363,2.1115,1.0141,2.84,0.2055,5.0597,4.4809,3.8659,1.2368,4.7698,0.2147,0.7728,0.6907,0.5905,2.5198,3.3227,0.5866,1.126,5.8596,3.7381,0.1536,1.2769,1.7864,0.1051,1.6815,2.9636,1.3011,2.0912,4.2099,2.8051,6.3637,3.5644,2.235,3.2937,0.7059,6.6248,4.1339,4.9753,0.9396,0.8203,3.0058,2.9847,5.0017,6.3094,0.9257,0.6762,0.5198,5.7439,0.527,0.0084,2.7363,0.1572,3.1552,1.6663,0.1109,2.8619,0.0003,0.0019,0.004,0.0564,2.8512,2.9773,2.4096,4.7104,0.1037,3.6357,0.7889,3.9864,10.6999,0.8418,1.6981,3.5128,2.7369,3.3146,4.5304,5.3795,0.0008,1.1942,0.7136,0.132,0.7677,0.9978,4.9005,0.823,5.6249,5.3032,1.0957,7.1112,0.4771,1.0404,0.2285,1.8566,3.6439,1.6548,3.7334,4.8006,0.5438,1.5959,5.5727,0.0004,0.0008,0.005,0.2906,1.7034,5.4446,4.076,8.1257,1.6474,0.1223,1.7699,0.3168,1.0365,3.7843,3.5636,3.049,1.2695,4.9592,3.3654,3.9102,3.9579,0.4678]}

According to McCabe, a project would have to be ready to apply for a new permit every seven years.\nNow, the response time is determined by each individual agency, and it must be within six months, he said.\nThe agency expects the changes to be beneficial to the industry, and the change in regulations will be part of a broader environmental reform process, McCabe said at a recent meeting of the State Environmental Policy Board.\n\u201cThis will help to make sure the agency continues to have a nimble program that is effective. We have a long road ahead of us in trying to reduce permitting and regulation while we also advance more progressive regulatory initiatives and regulations.\u201d\nBy the end of 2018, the E.P.A. expects to be eliminating 100 types of regulations that do not serve any environmental purposes by the end of 2012.\nEnvironmental officials have warned that without changes, companies may take the regulations \u201cas is\u201d rather than implement them.\nThey have also urged Congress to pass legislation providing greater flexibility in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s regulation program, along with providing more funding for the agency.\nMcCabe said his agency doesn\u2019t want to see regulations and regulations on the books become more onerous than the actual environmental benefits.\n\u201cAs you move forward, think of not just the six-month rule but make sure that we have good regulations that help achieve our environmental goals.\u201d\nThe E.P.A. is currently preparing to submit its budget for Fiscal Year 2017, which will be made public at the end of September. The agency estimates it will receive $38.5 billion, down from $42.7 billion.","token_len":474,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.5641,0.0002,0.0013,4.1883,6.2442,11.0026,0.7535,1.5267,7.1824,3.333,2.9288,7.2835,3.9617,1.5514,4.3148,4.5325,1.1088,0.0011,2.8861,0.9404,6.8413,0.0019,2.103,1.38,18.8009,8.5445,7.3476,3.6055,0.4175,1.0151,7.3723,1.817,4.6622,3.1676,2.3551,0.9205,5.465,1.8603,0.3619,3.9076,1.7824,0.6365,14.0149,4.3937,4.7272,4.2755,4.9084,0.0649,0.0146,3.3772,2.6993,3.8882,3.0017,6.6969,0.4676,5.207,3.3261,2.4877,5.372,2.8342,6.2215,4.6131,4.4534,5.9726,2.6467,1.1285,3.0333,0.0012,2.0709,1.5714,2.789,4.5107,2.2385,6.2818,0.1434,4.9674,1.213,5.0042,0.5535,0.0658,1.9177,2.143,0.0028,8.3749,8.7977,0.0685,6.7968,1.632,2.1596,0.3312,5.5246,0.8561,0.0143,0.413,0.2483,5.2573,0.3146,6.3335,7.7211,0.8563,0.4239,3.1868,1.8335,4.4862,6.6537,5.6282,3.7726,6.9808,2.9726,7.541,5.8551,3.1676,4.3598,3.3141,4.7482,0.5897,1.7768,1.4308,5.5481,5.2385,0.9213,1.9288,2.6772,0.6413,5.3992,4.3969,1.0233,6.7015,0.0008,2.7344,0.0737,3.3942,2.0682,2.9369,1.6126,0.4683,1.2248,5.6014,1.6557,4.6077,0.5532,1.3302,2.1669,0.1262,5.0133,3.4327,0.2039,0.9848,0.2882,6.7711,0.4306,1.3609,4.6293,1.385,2.1348,6.4536,0.2024,5.3492,3.9819,3.1624,1.3342,1.7951,3.2362,4.3436,0.3098,3.8782,1.1644,0.0134,2.6464,2.3662,0.2179,0.061,0.4342,1.5579,1.3516,4.4833,1.6475,3.4079,0.3733,2.0659,7.1837,0.4193,1.2377,2.8383,0.9338,2.4763,2.1841,4.7015,3.8849,5.9054,1.3633,3.4619,4.7,0.0019,1.6281,1.0614,4.7498,5.6185,3.3965,1.0666,1.1725,0.084,7.1076,0.5167,2.9342,2.0477,0.4865,0.4904,5.4553,2.338,1.788,3.184,0.5441,0.2442,7.523,5.8903,7.2371,6.0987,2.4364,2.6653,3.5558,1.4671,2.0611,3.3777,4.5394,0.1314,3.713,1.1329,9.2846,0.2924,6.2341,2.202,2.0413,3.0905,3.4094,3.0118,2.7658,1.7874,3.1148,3.713,0.1405,0.4851,0.0184,3.8043,4.6567,0.0286,3.9249,5.7118,2.6328,5.1524,5.6251,3.2908,3.734,6.475,5.7044,6.1299,3.1082,4.7147,3.2405,4.7808,1.5299,5.0634,6.7591,2.1357,6.5195,3.0424,1.157,0.0009,2.0342,0.0274,1.0875,6.1068,1.7973,0.016,0.0042,0.0994,0.0784,2.7987,1.2733,3.0448,8.555,5.4262,8.6375,0.0018,4.6568,2.6912,4.5255,0.0917,6.0876,3.3985,4.3542,4.1687,4.8723,1.617,0.0772,0.0015,5.6059,1.2207,1.057,5.1834,5.7878,2.3551,3.9756,0.384,5.4149,3.8283,1.8178,6.5136,3.4947,5.0514,3.3118,7.9737,12.496,3.5699,4.4955,5.9504,2.3772,4.8805,5.7134,0.086,4.2314,0.1136,0.8633,0.6554,5.3199,1.7809,1.0156,3.452,3.9033,0.1684,2.4608,1.1564,5.8962,3.1528,1.6494,1.9159,1.1785,5.1287,0.1641,0.0514,6.0582,2.8036,0.903,4.1674,5.1426,1.4557,6.2919,0.0057,5.6743,1.854,3.2684,0.6196,1.4686,0.6226,2.0084,0.3381,6.8853,0.0002,0.4128,4.359,0.0643,5.3269,4.4783,3.9069,0.0086,2.7342,0.2843,2.5366,4.1643,4.9125,1.4753,5.4669,1.0724,1.2214,5.9625,1.6816,7.4749,0.0005,3.0574,2.874,6.7609,3.5289,3.8418,1.4573,0.3509,3.2257,0.5843,3.9843,5.6265,3.6266,1.2103,0.7673,5.652,1.7127,7.8041,1.4064,1.3567,7.9144,0.4817,0.0409,3.8541,2.4056,8.0759,0.4328,1.2934,2.7787,1.9152,5.3432,3.1407,1.6636,3.8624,5.2799,1.8733,2.1562,0.1967,0.8062,1.8719,1.2593,0.572,2.5389,2.3722,0.0051,0.0015,0.0013,0.0008,0.0603,1.5481,3.3117,4.7884,1.3962,3.6816,1.5745,6.0594,1.5058,3.4609,0.0967,1.2687,1.305,1.0268,2.2961,0.8682,4.305,0.4959,3.3052,0.9547,0.2522,0.0007,2.7288,0.3982,2.2246,0.4147,4.1325,2.0588,0.3664,2.855,0.6473,5.6558,0.7135,1.7791,0.6267,3.6566,4.9933,0.2059,0.4235,3.2428,0.1403,2.2368,0.0035,4.0801]}

The two leaders have not met in person since the first of their summit talks in Singapore in June 2019, leading to reports that there were not too many expectations on the relationship, but the recent comments from Kim could have given the two a lot of hope that the meetings actually happened, even though they haven\u2019t.","token_len":474,"entropy":[9.0369,1.2308,0.1149,0.0175,0.2632,3.2454,11.8724,3.3481,4.6323,0.0584,8.7835,1.4441,2.1399,0.0046,6.5087,5.6104,4.1869,4.1445,5.9343,4.1866,3.8598,1.1466,5.7102,6.0639,1.3102,4.1811,3.0171,0.7259,9.9203,0.0434,0.126,5.1626,0.0109,0.306,0.0363,1.5402,0.5017,0.0079,13.2033,8.243,8.3374,7.5439,1.3614,0.0436,2.6209,2.3929,2.1252,0.9358,4.6911,0.9896,5.8758,3.5489,7.7589,4.8386,10.6704,5.2843,0.3184,4.6527,4.6628,3.4875,2.8799,5.5594,1.1794,4.2516,7.7124,0.7915,0.9916,1.5034,2.4101,3.1193,3.48,5.4404,7.9822,1.7354,0.0145,0.0019,8.0993,4.8063,3.6497,1.0821,1.2639,1.3002,2.4614,5.1435,3.6727,4.6368,3.6113,5.8206,1.4262,0.0058,4.2123,2.93,1.6685,0.362,6.1442,4.1153,2.921,1.9785,1.6938,0.0367,0.4296,3.4423,0.167,0.0019,2.8187,3.1328,2.4939,3.2141,4.8616,3.877,3.1993,4.3479,2.5787,1.129,5.6534,0.2614,2.6989,0.7914,0.9201,3.8212,4.0233,0.7541,4.0962,7.5107,5.2118,1.1481,4.9571,0.8015,1.6826,4.17,0.9142,5.2699,4.077,5.9365,2.4955,0.1979,4.2653,2.6297,4.3049,0.0734,7.3207,2.2757,2.0921,5.3261,1.497,1.2975,1.3658,7.7279,4.3573,4.4979,1.9316,6.3468,2.2626,3.1425,1.3668,3.2586,3.0001,2.1852,2.7649,5.6143,4.2387,0.1828,4.8565,1.7691,2.4347,4.9085,1.785,5.2787,4.9137,4.695,6.2502,4.5471,2.4762,2.5552,2.9033,1.6352,1.0767,5.5579,1.8878,4.3094,3.7283,3.5989,7.4324,1.9657,1.8705,0.3444,6.6292,6.3413,0.578,0.1834,3.6921,2.8518,0.6681,1.2122,0.0174,1.628,2.4033,5.9335,1.6327,2.2648,0.2729,3.2657,2.5658,6.2136,1.331,0.0487,2.1155,7.1813,1.4298,0.9379,2.2402,4.6138,3.5712,5.1375,1.8152,4.6223,3.4026,1.4049,4.022,4.9254,4.952,3.2379,0.0262,0.6607,0.0788,0.0053,3.201,4.0487,2.6036,6.466,3.4477,1.8665,2.4168,3.2957,6.4176,1.338,2.489,7.3016,4.1221,3.7022,5.7778,0.0401,3.0635,1.6443,3.3675,2.8908,5.623,0.0009,0.1704,3.2502,7.3708,4.1207,0.1312,1.6905,0.0033,6.2892,0.4019,1.3754,0.8916,3.646,3.7528,0.6343,3.7945,3.7183,1.0124,2.1972,4.7796,0.4933,10.5619,0.5345,3.5104,1.7513,2.5322,3.621,6.5463,5.7734,6.4076,0.1052,0.4578,1.148,3.5004,2.5723,2.1249,0.095,2.325,5.5669,1.9768,2.9506,0.3741,2.801,0.0798,1.0005,1.4144,6.1383,3.1028,0.3666,0.6783,2.1578,3.8831,5.6187,4.9181,4.6649,6.0325,3.2968,6.5196,2.1385,2.0438,3.369,4.0454,0.5966,2.2498,4.0901,0.0499,2.7825,0.9002,3.1609,1.7157,0.9464,0.3356,2.6053,1.4928,2.8675,4.1663,2.9166,2.1878,2.3556,0.467,2.3892,0.602,4.4049,2.8812,0.4535,6.4612,0.0346,1.5688,4.8368,4.0061,1.4219,2.5815,0.5224,3.7501,0.2607,1.5351,0.5343,0.1057,0.0246,0.0215,0.0338,1.7738,5.613,0.2234,0.3603,1.7015,1.0685,6.1723,1.4288,2.356,0.9428,2.28,0.5849,5.9497,6.7538,2.652,3.4816,2.9998,2.9016,1.8437,1.1849,8.9342,0.9376,1.7545,2.2221,1.8402,5.5261,4.8396,1.7682,0.1053,1.3742,2.0453,2.1969,6.7399,0.5433,3.6003,4.1669,0.9294,6.6907,0.4531,2.1273,3.5606,1.0639,4.3502,6.3946,2.2786,0.4118,2.3016,0.0206,0.9363,11.7454,4.8512,7.3792,5.7967,5.229,10.3407,4.8894,1.4154,1.7231,3.4377,3.9805,0.4707,2.2352,2.2934,1.5771,1.5488,1.6311,1.6125,1.8493,4.4127,0.7034,2.1383,3.8494,3.3632,1.8356,3.2829,3.1801,0.9916,7.3026,0.9595,2.7254,8.6861,0.9976,5.7671,0.8049,5.821,0.4823,3.378,2.4382,4.5769,4.5856,0.0167,8.7149,2.7075,1.221,5.2039,3.4851,2.7307,2.4298,5.3711,3.1501,1.7826,1.1255,5.3132,2.4335,4.1173,1.6697,2.6432,2.4591,3.1449,0.559,4.4883,2.3017,1.6147,6.1252,8.0278,3.2679,2.4333,3.4708,1.1792,1.6071,3.6304,1.4329,0.2151,0.0836,0.9885]}

During the war, the Soviet army successfully defended the territory of Moldova.

{"prompt":"Russia s Defence Ministry denied on Monday that Russian war planes had carried out deadly air strikes on a village in Syria s Deir al-Zor province that had killed dozens of civilians , the Interfax","text":"Russia s Defence Ministry denied on Monday that Russian war planes had carried out deadly air strikes on a village in Syria s Deir al-Zor province that had killed dozens of civilians, the Interfax news agency reported. It was not immediately clear whether the claim in the Interfax report had been denied by the Russian Defence Ministry. According to a statement issued by the UN rights group Amnesty International, at least 73 civilians were killed in Syrian air strikes on Tuesday. A Reuters correspondent said there were casualties on both sides, but that the military aircraft were carrying out bombing missions against the terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra, which according to the Syrian Arab Army, is backed by al-Qaeda. There are fears the Syrian rebels may be getting their weapons and support from neighbouring countries. According to the Syrian opposition, Russian combat aircraft attacked the village of Hamidiya along the border with Turkey, killing dozens of civilians.\nThe first half of 2014 was characterized by the economic crisis that swept through the European Union, and so at the time the euro was affected, as if to make sure no gains would be made in the currency, it was decided to make a change in its value, or what happens when the value of the euro falls below 1 euro?. Thus the first stage of the eurozone crisis began, which included Greece, Spain and Portugal, countries that were hit by the recession and the debt crisis. The crisis began with Greece and since then, Spain and Portugal have had similar problems, but they have taken the decision to cut spending and increase taxes. The crisis has affected the banking system of the States which is why it has a negative effect on the economy of the countries that were hit by it, in the first part of 2014, Spain led Europe and the United States in economic slump with a contraction of 2.1% in the GDP, followed by Greece with a value of 1.5%. The situation is worrying even more when it is seen that in January 2015, the two countries were facing similar problems with a contraction of 2.2% in the GDP of Greece and of 2.0% in the GDP of Spain. The countries that have suffered the most are Italy and France.\nAim and Objectives : The aim of the study was to determine the correlation between family conflict and the degree of satisfaction of needs in young people with cystic fibrosis.","token_len":475,"entropy":[8.1594,8.9329,1.6264,5.4982,2.8925,2.1992,0.3965,2.9627,3.1606,3.8566,0.7984,2.6355,0.0228,6.6527,2.8052,0.144,0.8582,2.9407,6.4153,0.6097,2.0851,9.1589,9.1949,0.1648,1.1532,0.0103,0.0299,2.198,1.417,2.9441,2.9327,5.8392,3.3689,0.1971,0.9926,1.4746,3.1212,7.1469,0.0148,0.0284,0.0108,0.2337,0.2165,3.6089,2.2471,1.4435,0.779,0.0798,1.4158,0.8226,5.9291,5.4528,0.9623,4.6082,0.0,0.3162,2.9027,0.4709,5.1845,1.096,0.8717,2.0144,2.2278,0.0147,0.5202,5.595,0.001,2.721,1.9433,1.5167,0.3299,0.549,6.3229,6.3811,2.1866,2.5436,0.0782,0.266,2.9305,0.0038,6.4984,0.6615,0.9,0.084,0.6943,3.9562,1.6001,0.0706,1.7484,3.128,1.094,3.7738,4.077,2.2315,2.5991,3.7288,0.8236,6.5661,3.0359,2.0467,0.0133,1.6588,1.5914,2.1945,1.7282,5.1332,6.32,1.6371,2.9179,0.0679,4.9467,1.5138,2.0577,2.045,5.9716,0.2987,4.8402,0.0041,0.3033,0.0303,0.0002,1.3432,1.3358,6.8552,0.0006,1.1948,2.4951,4.6238,1.7348,3.0376,1.1345,3.5875,0.0192,5.2388,0.3972,0.1776,1.4243,5.3936,2.628,3.0502,2.4023,2.263,3.8255,1.918,1.8398,6.218,3.189,4.595,2.8821,4.6837,0.1118,5.7829,1.1878,1.0593,4.908,0.0009,1.213,2.3261,3.7724,0.549,4.682,6.4472,0.8658,4.8597,1.6328,0.9897,0.4763,6.7027,5.4387,1.0417,7.1662,0.9238,1.7113,0.3708,0.5112,1.8615,0.8116,3.789,0.1637,0.6794,1.0789,2.3565,6.7246,5.695,7.1049,0.1285,4.5657,2.0499,5.2122,0.0983,2.7663,8.0874,1.179,2.0339,5.4272,0.9114,0.8154,5.1912,0.0869,1.2232,2.665,5.974,6.8366,0.7585,1.9495,2.0759,7.7626,2.2158,8.5999,2.2741,3.3253,6.7528,4.0871,4.0588,2.181,3.5867,7.6537,2.1008,0.4247,0.0585,1.9566,0.8255,4.8978,4.7754,4.3972,0.7332,3.7505,0.6506,4.3634,1.619,4.6733,1.5134,3.5273,4.6299,2.4003,4.2601,5.6265,5.0683,2.3688,1.2836,2.9673,0.4535,0.5745,0.4116,2.4129,1.4435,2.741,2.2001,7.7738,6.9608,6.2547,1.6429,3.68,6.3641,0.5161,0.5645,4.9722,0.8741,3.316,1.9116,3.2349,4.9072,3.4938,1.3038,2.2353,0.915,0.7178,1.2525,7.2004,0.9455,1.9094,5.0805,1.3039,0.7871,4.2249,2.0555,2.514,4.931,0.1753,0.856,1.5797,3.6944,3.5138,1.4203,2.5617,2.5985,8.8359,0.2407,1.7254,2.9549,0.9974,0.0322,0.2599,3.2063,4.6007,1.0751,1.5671,2.7252,2.7722,1.0359,4.2594,2.3406,5.7085,0.276,2.7937,2.5177,1.253,3.7433,1.9672,0.9231,1.7544,3.6905,1.5387,3.5794,1.4975,4.8546,0.2466,3.704,0.9788,7.5621,3.6238,2.5976,4.7541,2.617,1.5957,4.9471,2.7343,1.6959,0.2057,0.6502,2.5802,2.6974,0.6603,2.5049,1.1646,2.7661,0.7719,1.0281,1.5237,1.6832,4.2584,2.004,2.7487,4.0988,0.2693,0.7118,1.7062,4.6833,6.2372,5.5928,3.0104,2.3588,3.5458,0.1406,2.5616,5.6511,7.0251,4.0898,2.0837,4.3645,0.4916,2.3272,0.3115,2.7806,0.9329,0.8238,0.892,6.1276,1.9996,2.2805,0.0473,2.329,1.4978,0.4837,10.274,0.3381,1.7853,0.1562,2.3689,1.632,1.6226,4.2664,1.8761,6.7842,5.2024,3.2662,4.0009,2.7295,2.4357,3.8271,0.6302,2.828,4.9023,2.7674,0.7459,1.227,6.6517,1.135,2.4784,4.2691,3.9785,1.1979,2.2431,2.2777,3.2057,0.1607,1.3884,0.1359,1.8687,0.6706,0.7028,0.3639,0.2084,3.1629,2.0064,1.2899,4.1001,2.4436,0.081,2.7312,0.0569,0.3014,0.7409,2.9099,0.0305,0.5123,0.5239,1.6903,5.2054,0.677,2.184,2.7669,0.798,0.4286,1.6429,2.9742,0.5434,3.6269,0.9496,1.8489,12.7109,5.3476,6.0454,0.7368,4.7663,1.8272,1.3228,0.6014,0.5843,4.6422,0.9742,0.1304,2.3161,0.758,8.1611,0.1894,10.2059,7.1596,0.7209,1.284,5.919,0.302,7.6914,2.0533,8.6663,2.1443,6.8469,0.671,3.0098,13.3721,0.2036,0.028,0.0002,1.1133]}

Meanwhile, a quarter of Macron\u2019s voters come from socialist backgrounds, up from 20pc in July.\nThere has been a rapid increase in support in the past few months with the economic crisis. But a big hurdle remains : The next election in 2022.\n\u201cIn the coming months, we\u2019ll see a surge in popularity. The polls do indicate support, but how people vote remains to be seen. The next election should bring further results, \u201d said Marie-Laure Fiorentino, a political analyst at the CSA. In the elections, the president and his allies also face a challenge from left and radical right.\nMacron hopes to make himself the symbol of a new era of France. He has called on the public to be united, which has not happened. If the president is unable to get behind him, Macron will fall into disrepute, Fiorentino noted.\nFrance\u2019s political crisis also has an impact on other countries, including the United States. Trump has suffered heavy criticism for the government in France. Trump recently attacked Macron and the government in Paris with his tweet.\nOn the other hand Trump also expressed his satisfaction with French elections results. Trump posted on Twitter: \u201cI am very happy that the people of France have spoken, and voted very strongly for their political leadership, who are all people of exceptional talents, integrity, and commitment.\u201d (The writer is a political expert, the article was published on website.

{"prompt":"The airport on the Indonesian holiday island of Bali reopened on Wednesday as wind blew away ash spewed out by a volcano , giving airlines a window to get tourists out while authorities stepped up","text":"The airport on the Indonesian holiday island of Bali reopened on Wednesday as wind blew away ash spewed out by a volcano, giving airlines a window to get tourists out while authorities stepped up warnings.\nThe Ngurah Rai airport at Padang Bulan, west of the island, reopened its runways and taxiways after the volcano erupted on Tuesday. No flights had been cancelled, but air traffic controllers had issued warnings. The eruption created two separate fireballs that swept over the island in different directions, but both dissipated by late afternoon.\nThe volcanic island, also known as Gunung Agung, has been emitting steam and ash for months. More than 12,000 people were evacuated and evacuated villages have reopened. Travelers should avoid airports, but the traffic is calm, as of Wednesday afternoon. Airlines are planning to bring tourists out as quickly as possible. Earlier this week, Indonesia's transportation ministry said Indonesian airlines would need three weeks to adjust their flights, taking into account both security and weather conditions.\nThe Indonesian government and local authorities say volcanic activity has eased. A second fireball was spewed to the northwest, but dissipated shortly after emerging above sea level.\nThe airport says the volcano is visible on clear days from most parts of Bali and the weather was clear Wednesday, allowing runways to be cleared of hazmat suits. The airport is a major drawcard for travelers to the island, which sits in the heart of the western Indonesian archipelago. Its annual tourism revenue was reported to be $12.1 billion in the fiscal year that began on January 1.\nA flight to Bali was canceled at the end of Tuesday but was later reinstated and departed on Wednesday. Airline spokesman Ricky Soemantri said all flights on Wednesday carried normal numbers of passengers. Another flight, flying from a foreign carrier, was delayed briefly.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov","text":"The Kremlin said on Tuesday it hoped that President Donald Trump \u2019 s new ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman, could help breathe new life into battered U.S.-Russia relations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Trump himself had also spoken highly of Huntsman, who is an ally of the president\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, and his own son-in-law Jared Kushner.\u201dI hope President Trump will be able to use his influence to bring a new spirit and vitality into the relationship,\u201d Peskov told reporters after speaking with Huntsman and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.Huntsman, who announced he would leave the Republican presidential primary race on Monday, is the first former U.S. presidential candidate to move to a new post so far in Trump \u2019 s presidency.Huntsman will become the first Republican appointed ambassador since 1973 and the second in the Trump presidency. Peskov said Huntsman and Lavrov discussed the issues of climate change and Russian interference in the U.S. elections.Huntsman, a former Republican congressman, had served as senior U.S. military and intelligence official in post-Soviet countries. Peskov said that while Huntsman is focused on improving relations with the Kremlin and will not discuss sensitive issues, he could provide important information about Trump \u2019 s approach toward Russia.\u201cI expect this relationship to be very fruitful, to be a very constructive one. We certainly need to see a new spirit, a new vitality here,\u201d Peskov said.He added, however, that Huntsman would be a better choice than many of his competitors, especially if Trump wants to keep the American ally.Huntsman \u2019 s predecessor as ambassador to Russia, Thomas Pickering, was widely criticized by Americans, although this had no effect on the relationship between Washington and Moscou.Huntsman made an initial stop in Moscow before flying to Helsinki for talks with senior Finnish officials on Tuesday, reports said, but it is not clear when he will return to Moscow. On March 29, Peskov and U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft toured Moscow to inspect facilities where information about the coronavirus is being prepared. They also met with Health Minister Mikhail Murashko.During the trip, they called on Russia to take the steps necessary to ensure its population has health and medical aid.","token_len":477,"entropy":[10.9313,3.2284,1.8093,2.0809,0.8941,5.2999,2.2169,4.2369,2.8575,0.0121,12.7933,7.6705,8.6632,5.3613,6.1477,0.5408,1.3504,1.2651,9.8896,1.9803,0.0011,0.4252,3.5356,3.1763,10.6126,0.227,0.0045,0.0329,11.5251,4.0281,0.0005,0.0025,1.0236,0.8014,0.0998,0.5096,9.061,0.5796,0.0419,0.0,0.0001,1.912,0.3512,1.2985,1.4503,6.1654,1.5923,5.5308,2.9441,5.8796,0.034,1.1467,0.002,1.34,1.2127,2.6265,3.9259,4.2273,0.1597,1.8561,2.4374,5.6249,0.4348,0.907,3.8737,0.7592,0.5486,0.0097,2.5245,1.3226,4.4228,5.2982,2.7077,0.8932,0.0008,0.0022,0.0005,1.4304,0.001,0.3555,6.147,8.7118,10.468,5.051,4.464,0.3089,1.8678,2.8935,1.347,0.0275,3.6034,1.3501,3.8429,1.13,3.1608,3.097,1.3292,5.5612,3.3177,4.2866,2.9517,0.8729,2.8991,2.3861,6.5194,4.5588,0.9931,0.0004,1.8566,0.21,3.7782,4.4398,1.3236,1.3535,0.0012,2.9225,3.2226,0.8822,0.0685,0.6137,0.0001,0.7021,7.2866,0.0183,0.0007,1.5658,0.8145,5.8905,3.2432,1.4122,2.3293,0.5746,5.838,1.7603,2.0423,1.7001,2.0802,1.9941,0.4157,1.981,2.5759,1.9767,3.8233,2.1328,0.0003,0.0022,0.0016,6.9079,0.4317,0.266,5.8464,0.5947,3.7123,3.3134,2.2329,7.8737,1.7509,2.1534,3.1235,7.093,0.0806,0.8935,1.5129,0.2447,5.219,0.0043,0.0017,4.6476,3.212,0.7138,0.9387,3.896,9.1188,2.8778,4.2518,6.9799,3.3171,1.1446,2.6249,2.4912,2.4757,2.2373,4.6626,1.2505,9.4063,0.0009,0.6435,1.9139,0.0019,3.5695,3.183,3.5378,1.4152,5.2081,0.6725,4.4471,0.0297,0.9083,3.2931,4.4006,0.1107,0.3877,1.1965,0.0003,0.0044,0.1288,2.2791,1.3037,3.8919,0.0036,0.0014,2.0804,2.0315,1.05,3.5467,1.1245,1.9849,4.062,2.3924,0.5844,5.0528,3.9992,0.0003,0.0042,0.0009,4.9682,2.6798,0.8413,0.8461,1.3517,7.4716,0.1937,1.4086,1.6173,1.6832,5.6826,0.0007,0.4861,2.1707,2.7447,1.3594,0.0017,2.9547,5.738,0.0493,2.9914,0.7008,0.2448,2.5809,1.5924,2.054,5.533,2.1396,5.1788,4.2017,1.1284,0.7877,0.6711,4.5677,3.5973,4.0696,2.1872,1.837,3.4135,2.9121,0.01,0.0473,5.0532,4.0675,0.7361,0.9011,3.4296,4.1963,5.1139,3.9262,4.412,3.4128,0.7401,1.8333,2.7872,3.0146,1.9975,5.7774,1.7981,2.3251,2.2986,2.7928,1.121,1.7835,3.0638,5.8064,3.6985,0.6253,2.9821,2.4345,2.4059,2.03,2.7403,1.5924,0.1994,3.9342,5.4671,1.8133,0.7522,1.6242,0.1427,0.0007,0.4375,0.3016,3.53,1.812,3.1487,0.6005,0.0015,0.0255,2.1363,0.002,2.7247,1.8849,2.3069,5.5354,3.3256,2.3421,5.0949,1.9329,1.2064,5.4622,2.1448,2.9025,3.4741,2.634,4.5637,0.0825,4.3529,2.0021,4.7384,6.6264,2.7712,3.9694,0.0042,0.0022,5.8266,0.0195,0.0305,3.6587,3.1954,1.9329,0.6407,0.5993,0.8371,4.981,3.7945,0.0721,0.3675,1.701,4.5738,1.6723,1.9745,5.6347,3.5428,7.0844,5.7135,5.2454,3.8622,1.7743,0.147,1.776,4.6667,1.168,3.3445,0.0203,16.4423,6.1329,10.671,4.3439,5.7866,0.0019,0.0052,4.8639,3.554,3.0723,4.8886,0.2916,0.9513,4.733,5.281,0.3587,7.4436,2.105,1.9522,0.2876,5.6928,4.0577,1.1008,2.1789,2.595,1.8243,6.354,1.5103,2.2234,2.5682,3.6386,2.0548,1.0344,0.8251,2.7228,0.4265,0.5123,1.0896,1.2359,2.1821,0.4483,5.5985,5.77,3.5757,0.1126,5.715,0.0015,3.8096,3.8632,0.0057,0.0279,0.0229,1.1223,10.3684,8.8026,6.5405,2.4408,1.5907,6.0569,6.1134,5.6729,7.9916,1.9021,1.3595,12.0018,3.1123,1.8232,4.4215,1.024,3.9623,1.2963,3.1291,1.4925,1.0697,0.253,5.7648,0.3552,6.2986,6.7564,3.9424,4.6754,2.7857,4.5403,1.0442,1.4243,0.1599,3.7621,6.0805,1.0186,2.6533,0.3537,3.1088,3.2766,4.4215,0.4099,0.0576,3.5828,3.1537,6.7436,3.7033,4.658,1.6048,4.9039,6.5051,1.3593]}

Those in the industry, who were opposed to the move, say the rule will hurt consumers.\nThe draft rule released by the FCC proposes returning to so-called \"collusive review\" rules introduced in 2005. Under those rules, internet service providers had to submit to the FCC to be deemed as \"neutral.\" Under current rules, internet providers are simply considered third parties.\nUnder the proposed net neutrality rules, the FCC gave operators who wish to propose alternative internet services the right to ask for a change of regulation. The agency said it is now reviewing how they want to decide whether to support these proposals and how to deal with providers that refuse to enter.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed the bill that would repeal the Internet Freedom Protect Act, also known as Net Neutrality. The bill was approved by a voice vote. The vote marks the end of an extended fight between the FCC and the U.S. House of Representatives.\nThe Internet Freedom Act, signed into law by U.S. President Barack Obama in January 2015, mandated that America maintain net neutrality and that no provider may interfere with users\u2019 access to content across all platforms. The bill also called for the FCC to draft regulations that ensure internet content would be treated fairly.\nThe bill is scheduled to be taken up by the Senate as soon as there is a quorum on the floor of the Senate and signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump.\nAs many as 1,000 people gathered at the Grand Rapids home of Rep. Don Buck, one of the members of the Congressional Internet Caucus.

He also said that the volcano is likely to cool down after the weekend, and no warning of unrest from the crater is expected.\nMr Joko warned of volcanic dangers on Friday, saying a violent eruption from the crater was possible in the next few hours or days.\nHe urged holidaymakers to stay away from the volcano, including those visiting the tourist site of Kintamani, about 80km northeast of Bali's Denpasar, but added that people could visit some areas and that they should avoid the area as part of precautionary measures.\nKintamani is a popular location for those seeking a peaceful holiday and some resort owners and hotel guests have fled, but the government and the island-based volcano monitoring centre have said that a new eruption was unlikely within a week.\nA series of tremors were reported about 11.30pm (0730 GMT) on Thursday, the second time in three hours, followed by steam rising from the crater.\nThe volcano is about 2,300m in height and it had been largely dormant since August 2004, when a volcano erupted about 20km away killing at least 200 people. It has also been dormant after a series of tremors in 2008 and 2010.\nThe volcano, which sits on the border of Bali's northern and central regencies, has been monitoring a mild phreatic eruption from its crater since Tuesday.","token_len":478,"entropy":[9.6282,2.0644,3.8707,3.8054,0.0469,0.0221,0.0,5.2108,7.0821,2.1283,3.272,3.8195,6.045,0.1701,3.1071,1.3472,9.8694,3.3512,0.2645,3.2789,0.7649,3.3699,1.9698,0.3025,0.0046,5.7989,7.7894,1.5897,3.5372,0.8834,4.3412,1.0861,0.5855,0.0102,4.7963,0.9908,8.6835,3.2996,8.8821,5.6491,0.2066,0.5834,0.4386,12.2368,7.8937,0.8041,4.9908,0.5608,14.3413,5.5611,0.1505,0.0008,1.5665,0.7402,0.0089,0.0074,0.7345,0.6253,2.1986,2.126,4.5587,0.073,0.0187,0.2738,0.1128,0.0131,0.0361,0.0214,0.0941,0.0015,0.0011,0.004,0.0,0.1591,0.0075,0.0009,0.0007,0.0009,0.4454,0.0063,0.0003,0.0023,0.0043,0.0013,0.0054,0.0047,0.0029,0.0035,0.0178,0.0051,0.0196,0.0007,0.0002,0.0108,0.1459,0.7268,15.7355,2.1849,0.4482,3.8028,1.9132,0.0336,5.5704,0.9107,3.066,0.2389,0.8187,0.9639,5.0928,1.1163,6.7944,0.2737,0.2214,1.3944,4.4856,0.0018,2.3497,7.4196,2.7879,0.8766,0.1455,3.3781,2.8454,1.9714,0.6492,3.5087,6.9303,0.011,3.0222,3.869,5.2767,9.0826,1.4008,6.1579,2.5928,1.5872,2.1176,0.0005,5.1393,1.9614,0.1958,0.001,3.7928,4.511,3.5832,0.3614,3.6075,1.5232,2.7319,3.3119,4.3254,1.3023,3.504,2.9152,4.5956,3.694,6.6794,2.97,0.009,0.9179,0.5431,0.1367,3.168,3.9864,3.3588,3.5566,0.3589,3.9644,0.8073,1.4891,1.6712,0.3168,1.5846,1.7319,1.7927,6.327,4.0405,0.4961,4.0297,2.7919,3.6239,1.3592,7.3137,1.6736,0.6524,6.3388,0.0017,2.3961,1.4073,6.7366,9.8757,3.1474,3.0846,5.9022,3.7956,4.2034,4.0468,2.165,0.7359,1.4731,1.4127,1.7995,3.8122,4.1081,0.0917,5.4966,0.3879,3.4298,1.6053,2.8737,2.2445,2.3766,6.0137,6.0704,3.8972,8.4018,4.5332,0.9332,8.3311,3.9006,0.8203,0.4704,0.0565,5.1679,0.2952,0.2382,7.1641,2.4328,6.0564,4.0454,2.9716,2.4833,1.3367,1.1823,3.9775,5.8839,0.499,3.7987,0.7082,4.0685,2.5292,2.8623,2.9587,0.7147,1.7882,0.5824,1.2739,4.341,0.6962,0.3857,0.2623,2.285,4.1783,8.5447,0.3457,0.2896,1.6763,1.3346,0.0859,0.6348,1.0954,1.4295,5.7048,2.4805,2.4537,1.6044,3.9568,4.3853,0.9202,3.5516,5.0871,5.7051,5.1487,1.2795,4.9655,3.5155,2.4011,3.7594,0.0365,2.3014,0.0013,3.5248,9.8785,3.3537,0.001,3.0117,4.3954,3.1673,0.3291,3.498,3.4471,4.3775,4.8808,2.9698,4.0017,3.0264,2.8861,0.966,2.4236,2.0638,1.8121,3.5985,5.4564,0.0008,6.0799,0.0645,0.0618,0.1751,0.1067,5.5476,0.3459,0.0365,0.0019,0.9216,1.8203,1.5867,5.1493,0.3306,5.3839,2.5208,1.908,2.7961,1.4671,3.0332,5.1286,5.6674,1.6429,3.3853,3.3052,5.274,1.1122,7.0703,3.6577,3.0524,2.127,3.154,4.0912,2.0587,3.6424,6.0318,1.1723,5.5877,4.3388,4.448,1.2113,1.9825,2.2295,3.8691,4.6728,0.7662,2.9477,2.6534,4.709,1.7842,1.4266,0.4279,0.1546,3.2001,4.5679,0.0009,5.3339,0.0005,3.1633,1.1463,5.3577,4.0541,1.3977,0.7434,2.5966,1.3357,3.1953,1.7668,0.0123,0.4058,1.1021,1.6098,1.2706,2.9988,4.6375,4.3435,0.9251,2.4499,5.2386,3.7075,4.9076,0.0421,9.6087,1.5697,1.5991,0.393,1.4639,1.4351,0.6972,1.7747,1.9347,2.0413,3.4078,3.5079,0.5134,2.7767,2.9038,4.5823,1.9087,0.6101,4.2735,4.6328,1.2162,5.1144,0.4687,1.2998,4.9429,4.749,1.1067,0.9026,2.1864,3.6491,1.1371,3.8784,3.3286,1.1114,3.5897,8.6366,2.1553,0.0002,4.0145,0.2334,0.6581,3.2004,1.4908,3.2531,1.0171,3.9208,5.9401,1.3711,0.8669,0.001,4.5244,0.0089,2.387,3.5898,1.4497,2.205,1.2362,0.2459,2.0799,1.6651,2.8765,0.5439,5.413,1.5751,1.205,5.1054,1.8342,2.5255,0.8599,4.187,4.6406,1.2745,2.5366,12.238,4.9526,0.3255,1.4587,1.0841,5.9749,2.7401,8.017,9.3216,5.3441,0.4005,0.9609,3.6209,3.2544,2.4325,1.9031,4.976,0.8956]}

I cannot even begin to express what a huge week this has been for me. My mind is consumed with memories of the day when my daughter was born. My heart is filled with happiness and love. I am still learning to handle the world my little miracle girl has thrown me. I am still learning to be a mom. Sometimes, I'm tired, sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm sad and disappointed. No matter how you feel in the moment, I think you're still going to be a mom your entire life.\nThe birth and death of a child is a life changing event. The love we show one another never lets go and it becomes the foundation for our love for each other for the rest of our lives. In my daughter's first year, I have had a lot of joy and a lot of grief. I've struggled and have been a parent who is trying to be the best and to give my daughter the best, to keep her safe. I'm not at the peak of perfection as a mom, but I'm a mom who loves her and hopes she loves me back.\nI have tried to instill in myself that it's a never ending process. Every mom has to work hard to be the perfect mom her child deserves. I feel like I have this idea of how it's supposed to be done. However, I also know that I'm never going to be the best mom that I could be. Each and every day, I need to work harder and harder at being the dad, sister, friend and partner my little girl deserves. My hope is that my daughter is happy in this world and I will work every day to instill kindness in her heart. I am proud of the person she is becoming and I am inspired everyday by her strength and her ability to do so much in a small body.","token_len":479,"entropy":[9.6282,2.0644,7.9756,5.1023,0.0652,5.2949,5.6765,1.4462,11.005,5.0729,9.8362,8.4454,8.154,3.3259,2.6888,2.0339,2.0441,1.655,3.3297,4.3976,0.2328,5.3778,2.0858,0.7568,4.4245,12.2995,14.7787,2.4033,0.2875,2.0314,3.4213,2.0129,0.8331,1.6662,4.7085,7.2215,2.8386,2.8973,0.0667,0.0195,0.0,2.9103,0.8347,5.8718,0.5046,1.6053,2.2379,0.2285,5.2033,0.3021,0.0129,0.0098,0.0091,0.0097,0.004,1.5422,3.7672,4.852,0.0467,4.1529,6.8226,0.8294,6.747,2.8964,6.1766,1.859,2.2164,7.2765,3.4886,8.7446,3.9413,0.2845,0.6194,22.6428,3.4405,6.7384,3.3506,0.0362,4.031,7.8699,11.2113,0.261,3.1851,2.6841,0.0007,0.32,5.8795,6.6775,5.9583,7.3839,9.8438,6.5613,6.9785,2.2297,2.701,0.0716,0.3644,0.0017,0.263,2.9442,9.0057,1.7159,7.5651,8.508,4.9213,1.8811,3.4237,3.2311,7.0813,4.7184,0.8712,0.026,2.5808,3.4095,1.8048,3.8204,4.9394,2.0931,1.024,0.0703,0.4506,0.9348,0.6736,3.4761,4.9945,0.9796,8.0751,0.6941,6.4196,0.3976,1.7626,4.0237,2.4513,2.5853,3.9514,1.4348,0.9236,1.5984,2.5065,1.8147,1.5195,1.5303,0.0429,4.9543,1.1325,4.4366,1.2147,1.3767,1.8059,3.8082,4.7717,2.8421,6.0734,1.6866,4.9689,5.9046,4.7896,10.735,4.9228,1.8269,5.7504,3.1464,2.0492,1.32,1.1002,1.4785,2.4776,1.0054,3.029,1.2347,4.5351,1.3732,6.3747,1.741,1.138,4.4831,4.7932,3.3307,2.1385,0.1749,0.374,3.4601,0.896,0.89,0.1458,0.3706,1.4468,3.0364,8.0536,0.5029,5.8704,0.3509,0.9334,4.5974,1.3606,5.1604,1.9194,1.1185,0.1099,2.3977,4.5263,2.1736,1.9625,3.3729,2.2712,0.1466,1.2628,2.3921,1.5133,8.8424,2.0996,0.108,0.2125,1.898,3.3727,6.428,5.1444,2.5807,0.113,2.7989,1.873,1.3667,1.4951,4.1612,3.8746,0.8378,0.7449,2.9075,6.3827,4.0814,6.0777,3.5808,0.0499,6.5076,6.2324,1.049,2.7963,2.6341,4.5489,3.3443,3.4524,1.5448,2.1654,4.3361,1.8497,0.7057,0.0166,5.2471,1.108,0.2596,0.0009,0.1176,0.0253,0.0648,4.043,2.3843,4.1633,0.0745,4.3163,1.7133,1.2159,0.9088,4.7234,3.2831,1.9693,2.2093,0.194,4.6708,1.1633,2.7886,0.1029,0.0104,3.8425,0.6002,1.244,3.1018,5.4784,3.9506,4.6688,2.3845,4.147,6.3995,5.3998,2.8285,3.4397,0.265,3.11,2.2074,0.3622,4.395,2.752,3.6676,1.7966,0.4302,0.5926,0.2259,4.285,2.827,4.0977,0.4408,2.5096,2.0487,1.0608,2.7776,2.4595,5.856,2.5008,4.3493,0.131,4.5453,4.6047,1.3996,1.3599,0.8976,0.403,0.4771,1.8413,3.6801,1.8319,0.5392,3.0268,1.3612,4.074,6.1198,1.7336,4.4908,1.4672,3.5704,0.3883,1.5067,1.4302,2.4223,4.3394,0.5524,7.0242,0.0708,1.3989,3.9826,1.6046,3.926,1.0271,4.0423,7.3471,0.6662,1.7419,1.1824,3.6235,6.1636,1.9135,2.4154,3.6066,1.0873,0.9998,1.9591,1.5934,3.7243,0.6103,7.0924,2.7786,2.1612,0.3901,1.3774,4.841,1.3532,0.816,1.7725,5.2725,5.7012,1.5541,2.538,3.6269,2.0226,2.3016,0.001,0.804,1.6358,1.0153,5.6015,0.0526,1.0528,3.0241,1.7887,0.5341,1.518,2.119,3.5219,0.5596,0.016,0.8095,1.6131,1.7486,0.6108,3.0944,0.7823,2.0474,0.9528,0.4713,6.7104,2.1073,0.0131,0.774,0.9659,0.4164,5.0021,0.3933,2.311,1.1874,1.6268,1.2123,4.8178,3.0015,0.6164,8.3135,3.6564,8.4013,0.2985,3.2178,1.3176,4.5982,3.8649,2.7741,0.408,1.4985,0.2108,4.1452,3.8228,0.2805,0.2504,2.2676,0.4934,2.5461,2.9054,3.7988,2.4828,1.6696,1.1238,2.5488,2.2926,4.1165,5.513,0.1259,0.1385,5.1721,0.0198,8.5772,2.1326,0.2943,3.3497,1.1429,1.5805,2.5968,3.2292,0.8737,2.413,5.8653,3.6224,0.5553,6.6546,1.0951,1.0965,1.2357,6.5998,8.8438,0.701,1.0307,5.6202,0.7228,3.0735,4.1354,0.0758,3.2353,3.1751,4.5354,3.8377,2.302,3.7864,8.3427,0.5801]}
{"prompt":"President Donald Trump s U.S. Middle East peace negotiator Jason Greenblatt will return to Israel next week for talks related to the peace efforts , a senior administration official said on Friday . The trip","text":"President Donald Trump s U.S. Middle East peace negotiator Jason Greenblatt will return to Israel next week for talks related to the peace efforts, a senior administration official said on Friday. The trip will take place in late January, a few days after the election, the official said, requesting anonymity because the discussion is private, according to a copy of the statement released by the official. Trump appointed Greenblatt, a former top Israeli diplomat, to replace U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who stepped down in late September after six years. Greenblatt, the official said, will meet with both Israeli and Palestinian officials and be briefed by officials in both sides about their positions. He will be accompanied by U.S. President\u2019s chief of staff John Kelly, the official said. \u201cThey will discuss both sides\u2019 positions and evaluate the progress being made,\u201d the source said. Greenblatt\u2019s trip seems to follow a similar pattern as that of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who visited the region in December but did not meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Pompeo had said that he would have stopped at the Green Line, dividing the West Bank between Israel and the disputed Palestinian territories, but that his trip did not include talks with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu or Palestinian Authority President Abbas. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Sean Spicer, said after the September appointment that \u201cit\u2019s important to get to the point where the peace process is back on track\u201d and that it may be possible to reach an agreement by the end of the year. Trump also appointed former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia David Schenker to replace David Friedman in Washington, a move that sparked an attack on Israel\u2019s intelligence. The U.S. State Department issued a statement that was later withdrawn, saying that it was the first reaction to the appointment and that \u201cthere are many candidates\u201d the department would want. The statement said Schenker and his team would receive training at the State Department\u2019s Middle East unit in Jordan.

{"prompt":"The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday failed to approve a bill to allow the Federal Aviation Administration to continue to operate and a package of tax relief bills to aid hurricane victims after ranking","text":"The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday failed to approve a bill to allow the Federal Aviation Administration to continue to operate and a package of tax relief bills to aid hurricane victims after ranking Democrats on both committees blocked it. The vote by the Energy and Commerce Committee, which had been expected to pass the bill in a 23-19 vote, was delayed for a week after Republicans joined with Democrats seeking a floor conference to work out remaining issues. The legislation would have protected nearly 40,000 jobs in the airline industry, but the two main Democratic operatives who would have had to vote for the legislation were gone.\nIn a press conference after the conference, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee said she and her colleagues refused to approve the bill because they wanted to keep a floor conference open to discuss tax issues in a different budget bill -- one that was passed by the full House a week ago but only by a slim margin. She said there was no indication after Monday night's conference that there would be a change on the part of the House budget bill on tax issues. \"We will continue to engage with members on the committee and the broader floor from beginning to end on what we need to do to support our constituents and the national economy,\" she said, adding that the committee would hold a floor vote next week on either the FAA bill or tax relief bills.\nDemocrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee said several of its members supported the FAA legislation, but some said they would leave the floor conference open to let Democrats have more time on tax issues in a separate package.\nThe Republican operative on the committee also said the final vote on whether or not to pass the FAA legislation would be Wednesday at around 4:00 p.m EDT, when senators would have their breaks. Representatives would then have a few days before that point to convene a conference to sort out how to approve two of the FAA bill\u2019s amendments and how much money each will cost. One amendment would have extended the FAA\u2019s authority to operate until Feb. 7, the day before the final tax overhauls expire.

{"prompt":"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has issued grand jury subpoenas seeking testimony from public relations executives who worked on an international campaign organized by former Trump campaign adviser Paul Manafort , NBC News reported on Friday","text":"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has issued grand jury subpoenas seeking testimony from public relations executives who worked on an international campaign organized by former Trump campaign adviser Paul Manafort, NBC News reported on Friday in response to reports that the special counsel intends to question Manafort in his upcoming Senate hearing.\nThe subpoenas would require an immediate response from Manafort's employees, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke to NBC on condition of anonymity. The person said the subpoenas were not based on any charges that Mueller has uncovered against Manafort, but the subpoenas could \"open the door to other information about his conduct,\" including his work with a group of foreign actors whose activities he coordinated. \"\nAccording to NBC's sources, the subpoenas were issued a day earlier in the course of his investigation into campaign finance violations, although the sources said the subpoenas are not linked to Manafort's testimony in the potential Senate hearing, NBC reported.\nRobert Mueller will testify before the Senate on Feb. 6, ahead of the Democrats' impeachment call in which he will call for new evidence to confirm the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice that he has uncovered against Trump.\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday night called for criminal cases against Democratic Party former presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden Jr., his grandson Hunter Biden, and his son-in-law, former Vice President Joe Biden, according to Politico.\nTrump took to Twitter to call on his allies to support the idea of a prosecution saying, \"Tell your Congress people and the grand juries of our great nation to stand up and look into our stolen elections, our stolen electoral college vote. Bring it on!\"\nThe tweet was an excerpt from a written statement that Trump sent to lawmakers on Monday on how the investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign by special counsel Robert Mueller has evolved.\nAccording to Politico, Trump claimed that, as part of the investigation, several of his aides and associates \u2014 including Manafort and his close associate Carter Page, who has been accused of committing crimes connected to the 2016 election \u2014 had sought direct access to his email account.\n\"It would appear that former White House officials and others working at the campaign were trying to gain access to the president's official account, which is not a right,\" Trump wrote, as reported by NBC News. \"Of course, there was absolutely nothing improper about these emails or the fact that the president authorized these transactions.\"","token_len":482,"entropy":[10.3369,3.0663,0.7179,2.6226,4.8513,8.1682,0.4133,0.0376,0.0006,3.608,3.9599,0.58,7.0708,6.4858,2.8093,2.6754,2.7037,0.8539,4.7334,5.4843,3.2551,7.9153,0.1553,3.5505,1.4521,0.1359,3.6167,1.0194,0.0012,1.8799,5.9296,0.3551,0.4816,2.165,1.7308,7.0771,5.3535,0.0023,5.3516,0.6718,1.8211,3.0569,0.0424,5.6764,0.0356,3.9354,1.9232,2.6537,2.8328,6.0638,4.401,2.6365,0.5605,0.2211,14.9354,2.477,0.0057,4.0315,3.7162,3.6821,4.7567,3.9216,0.4168,1.5515,1.7139,7.4746,0.9897,2.3314,0.0036,2.0183,1.4118,0.3906,0.0022,0.0769,0.3515,2.6577,1.023,2.6262,0.7467,2.8349,0.2604,0.0127,0.0012,0.6581,2.1372,0.2902,0.9919,1.064,1.826,0.004,1.334,2.8237,5.0084,0.09,1.4764,5.8378,2.896,3.5774,1.322,6.0501,1.408,0.2147,1.1606,0.6255,3.9436,3.3476,0.0102,2.3897,5.186,5.3033,0.7937,0.2636,0.9158,3.3376,5.0035,2.5724,3.4653,3.883,1.66,3.1734,2.5652,3.565,1.9526,2.4165,3.8178,1.3734,2.6911,5.5497,5.2546,2.3054,1.922,7.0831,1.958,5.1745,8.9357,8.7819,0.006,2.3558,2.2463,1.2043,0.1253,1.4771,1.6434,0.0073,2.1975,1.1615,5.4553,0.832,3.4822,3.347,2.4573,4.2279,0.0004,4.0015,1.2887,0.5355,6.104,1.6432,0.8563,2.2946,5.0446,1.7308,3.7156,1.2912,1.675,1.9687,0.0094,2.8407,1.9048,6.1861,0.0745,2.1556,0.9481,6.5029,3.1742,0.6868,7.5043,3.6398,0.457,3.1199,5.2165,1.2498,0.178,0.4095,8.015,0.1992,4.1291,3.4687,1.3715,0.5463,0.3725,4.1152,3.6267,0.0025,3.1684,1.0135,6.4249,0.0008,1.1184,7.8591,0.028,7.0406,9.302,2.8931,4.1297,1.1427,0.9493,5.52,1.178,4.3786,3.5889,1.3669,6.9678,1.6419,2.9401,2.3023,7.931,0.1153,0.4366,2.2608,0.7928,0.0804,0.0043,2.8994,2.0828,1.3921,2.2821,1.8943,1.7812,1.3106,0.884,5.7445,1.0184,0.004,3.1584,2.8929,3.6055,2.9646,0.8121,5.1182,7.7789,0.5021,5.2626,3.6821,7.5794,2.1598,0.8111,9.4871,2.7525,0.1357,0.4972,0.1286,0.8396,3.8623,7.1126,9.4594,1.1476,2.3752,0.6612,2.0657,2.1297,1.4128,0.0005,0.0008,0.0002,2.2724,6.9448,3.48,0.0097,1.6214,0.0229,1.2703,4.0241,0.004,3.5508,0.2321,0.634,3.1825,5.8187,0.5442,0.0988,1.437,2.4182,1.9733,2.475,5.2676,0.6953,4.3759,1.3017,7.1462,0.3341,2.0529,5.6508,9.5671,1.0083,0.0739,7.423,3.1016,4.6032,7.0796,4.947,1.5834,8.814,3.9346,0.0002,4.0591,2.9222,2.4386,2.0432,1.0745,4.3561,0.4082,1.1871,5.5678,2.1708,3.6451,9.102,3.7749,2.0589,4.0887,5.5029,4.3163,2.5648,3.9,3.5522,5.5349,1.4759,1.0783,1.1207,0.4183,2.8425,4.3503,1.8275,4.9955,6.239,0.3929,0.8629,6.8573,0.796,3.0385,1.7068,2.5653,0.5104,4.4999,1.1234,1.2601,5.7609,4.4551,2.0671,1.6423,1.279,2.2496,4.5358,1.2056,0.125,7.1141,1.9529,0.0141,0.0257,0.0844,3.0015,3.6112,0.9449,0.4075,11.5937,0.0012,2.7105,0.1853,1.5169,6.2527,0.9969,5.0027,3.3394,2.0366,0.0009,1.0299,0.6936,0.6051,7.1668,2.8817,0.5925,2.9742,2.4341,1.6696,4.8887,0.2682,2.2595,1.5792,1.1008,4.5864,2.7271,3.1765,0.0017,1.3209,1.2275,2.8328,1.5114,3.462,0.1749,6.7196,3.3014,4.8936,0.3591,1.2554,2.7123,1.2112,0.2921,1.7022,5.2186,6.4309,0.8848,0.0839,3.3624,5.2612,2.0254,1.3098,0.7806,1.6603,3.3358,3.7157,2.6562,0.4307,5.3781,4.8159,0.002,3.0547,1.952,2.7467,3.8372,3.161,0.4938,1.1991,2.0706,4.5038,0.052,2.7673,0.2526,0.1065,1.438,3.5875,0.1768,5.0004,2.1445,2.1196,1.5718,1.9964,3.3377,2.6615,7.1844,2.2391,0.3938,0.7079,2.4994,4.9385,1.8085,0.0892,4.3956,0.9493,0.1496,0.8873,6.5201,0.1694,0.3658,3.103,1.8567,3.924,1.6376,2.2514,1.1354,3.3664,3.589,3.4996,2.0092,2.9075,0.1231,2.3955,1.5122,6.9323,2.8798,6.6777,1.4277]}

Instead, it is the process and the substance of the negotiations,\" a US White House official said Thursday.\nThe UN said it was working with all sides to ensure the talks were held to their planned date. This would signal a clear shift in UN diplomacy from the United States - Israel - Turkey effort to focus on the realities on the ground in Syria.\n\"It is very important that the three sides show an unshakable commitment from the beginning to the end to bring the Geneva 4 talks to the end they aim,\" said Thomas Andrews, a senior UN official involved in the talks.\nThe talks are expected to be the biggest yet in the long-running conflict as more than 100 people have been killed in Syria since Saturday, including 13 in a major attack on Aleppo. But the violence has been limited to the Syrian border with Turkey and border towns rather than the country's heartland Damascus.\nThe talks have been described as a diplomatic initiative, with the main goal to establish a cessation of violence. The United States, Turkey and the United Nations are leading the effort and have called for a comprehensive cease-fire that includes the border towns of Afrin, Ras al-Ain, Bab al-Saraj, Qamishli and Jarablus in Aleppo governorate.\nUN officials met on Thursday and have discussed how best to proceed, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric reported.","token_len":482,"entropy":[6.9248,2.5412,3.8692,1.5931,1.8927,0.6263,1.5103,1.7255,6.751,2.1887,5.6288,0.1792,8.416,3.0463,2.2955,0.4502,3.7363,4.4695,0.012,2.8461,8.5233,0.0026,9.0905,1.249,2.6087,1.7179,0.6668,7.0615,0.3191,2.4089,2.4694,2.3,2.4007,1.7373,10.8022,3.209,2.3387,6.1465,1.1994,4.442,3.3655,5.5104,3.3764,0.2446,11.5025,5.0833,4.8314,1.7756,0.611,4.1184,0.5467,3.9607,1.6787,4.6251,7.8839,1.6508,2.4812,0.2699,1.2262,3.1874,1.2137,4.3169,1.2546,7.8179,0.2806,0.6905,0.0054,2.568,0.0002,0.0075,0.0274,0.2512,0.9704,3.6701,1.4311,3.0209,0.8588,0.6519,6.7137,0.2938,0.7042,0.604,2.992,3.0546,0.2336,0.4974,2.9798,1.5772,3.9367,6.5863,3.3032,3.7082,3.8985,3.2992,6.8101,2.9363,4.4907,0.3175,1.3591,0.4258,2.3334,6.8254,0.353,1.1676,2.5253,7.4412,3.3268,3.5818,0.0039,0.2901,1.7082,1.9319,0.0016,4.498,2.2165,0.3167,0.4874,2.4118,3.7352,0.8179,0.4825,4.0248,4.0979,1.4964,5.8909,0.5039,2.6321,1.3379,0.1021,1.6579,4.8158,3.3688,0.7777,5.704,1.4722,3.1846,0.4375,4.8146,2.3871,0.9316,3.0317,1.6665,7.4575,4.924,2.5598,7.9604,0.0927,0.0005,1.3239,2.284,4.3178,4.8526,7.4452,1.1651,7.5253,0.0868,8.2039,0.7913,1.251,3.6704,0.9259,0.5783,1.3231,1.9783,0.4208,4.4717,5.483,1.085,4.3322,2.0892,3.1893,0.9529,0.1353,0.6778,4.0265,0.0099,3.0915,1.0901,5.2113,3.8219,1.7515,4.3073,0.3723,5.2092,0.6153,0.6542,0.7072,6.6588,0.6871,3.6542,3.277,0.3715,2.807,3.3,6.2038,2.0809,2.2799,3.8294,2.6443,4.2497,0.2043,1.3249,0.3866,0.6502,3.7801,3.8827,1.0769,7.1488,0.5733,0.5709,1.4539,1.6682,3.199,3.9969,7.4477,0.0006,0.1529,0.3996,3.6746,0.2871,0.1925,1.1224,4.5098,2.3797,1.4344,1.2692,3.6265,0.6658,3.3081,2.7231,0.6975,2.8718,1.6114,1.815,2.6543,3.2254,2.3558,6.4283,6.4081,4.5239,1.119,6.5785,1.8059,7.0936,1.7136,4.5397,1.5937,0.5608,5.7111,5.1741,1.8434,1.3586,5.3321,0.3866,7.4019,8.8965,2.8126,10.4418,14.0158,0.8704,2.951,0.1972,1.5304,8.524,5.2443,0.0664,0.0024,1.8289,0.165,0.6623,0.2917,2.1711,3.0415,0.5296,4.2788,0.7759,0.585,0.9261,5.6934,2.07,6.1448,4.7855,5.7053,2.1128,0.0695,0.6011,6.8748,0.5913,1.838,0.9009,2.7546,0.4045,1.6736,3.8563,1.4987,5.1828,0.9705,2.0603,0.3555,3.6398,2.2745,8.3032,5.948,5.343,0.9655,5.5425,9.528,0.0935,1.4342,0.8806,2.3319,0.8714,4.2902,0.0589,0.3899,0.7481,0.2926,0.4919,1.2136,3.2095,1.8453,2.1118,0.0049,1.9902,2.7512,3.5992,5.3541,1.5675,1.2346,4.4595,0.6282,0.1939,1.5841,5.0136,3.8062,0.1546,2.8565,4.1919,1.0694,0.3747,0.006,1.3727,2.615,1.5651,7.1505,1.2745,2.3356,5.6534,3.9892,2.5375,4.8379,2.4548,0.6317,4.9849,1.4619,5.6334,1.235,4.227,0.7947,2.8983,5.7532,0.4326,1.8801,4.9095,2.9627,3.3608,0.9813,1.6411,6.656,2.4451,7.8609,0.0058,1.0095,3.1067,0.1587,7.5988,0.0553,7.6561,0.7515,0.4398,1.4165,3.5882,1.9698,1.1299,5.0851,0.7107,1.0437,5.7288,6.5363,2.4604,2.3171,1.2657,3.7009,1.2728,2.7422,4.1459,0.4234,6.9971,0.0206,2.7501,2.2473,1.9332,1.6543,0.4097,2.2977,2.8167,0.258,1.7922,2.4571,0.1244,2.58,4.5867,0.3856,1.4964,3.4477,1.8262,4.0904,0.6648,1.1644,5.0191,3.3965,0.0089,0.0005,3.1452,2.6842,2.2351,7.2165,3.8952,0.5272,6.3584,0.048,1.0942,6.4068,0.295,0.0709,0.472,0.6434,1.4961,5.7637,0.3207,0.0244,5.6229,4.9865,4.5414,0.9765,4.5653,2.2218,0.0084,0.031,0.698,4.7791,0.5418,0.003,3.8559,4.5385,5.5913,0.1938,0.4616,0.5015,4.6348,2.6905,5.5303,1.9998,0.7727,3.0307,4.9685,4.2864,3.1649,3.3725,0.016,2.314,1.7414,6.4368,1.6837,0.3685,0.0,0.0017,0.0,0.0,7.5066,0.6588]}

CNN obtained a memo from a congressional ethics committee that includes Farenthold\u2019s name as one of the individuals who asked to be interviewed by the committee on ethics violations related to the investigation. The committee\u2019s memo was written by the head of the House of Representatives ethics department, who is responsible to the committee chair, which includes Farenthold. The memo was prepared after the House Ethics Committee wrote a letter to the president\u2019s Office of Management and Budget last week asking it to investigate Farenthold for his alleged relationships and contact with lobbyists.\nTrump told reporters, \"We've never seen anybody do that to people so poorly, as poor as they did. And we had to give them an incentive. We had to give them money.\"\nThe Washington Post reported Thursday that the president and his associates had proposed paying $25,000 to the parents of each family whose child was killed when his administration sought to block funding from the federal government agencies that had planned to distribute the vaccine, The Washington Post reported.\nThe president, who is under increasing pressure from some senior officials to end the administration's push to keep the federal government from sending the vaccine, has repeatedly said it wasn't as much an issue of money as it was about the process.\n\"The issue isn't money,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"It's the process. It doesn't matter how the money is handled, money is going to be spent.\"\nThe Daily Caller news organization reported Sunday that the federal government's vaccine supply from Pfizer was delayed again on Saturday by a week due to an outage caused by \"an unexpected internal communications glitch,'' according to a spokesperson who did not want to be named. The vaccine shipments will be distributed across the country, but there is a large delay before people received the COVID-19 vaccine, the source said.\n\"The problem was the lack of coordination or communication between Pfizer and the government that is responsible for getting the vaccine into the arms of Americans,\" he said. \"We did try to notify the CDC in advance, so they could make these vaccine distribution changes, but the CDC was not able to accommodate these changes.\"","token_len":483,"entropy":[10.1366,7.5699,2.2912,6.8431,0.1161,0.0042,0.0968,8.1549,6.3581,0.0593,0.0001,0.0001,0.0001,1.5389,1.9654,1.7714,7.2105,1.3881,4.839,4.7447,4.3941,4.4604,2.2097,0.5723,0.6452,1.5103,3.1166,5.4775,1.2353,5.9724,0.5778,2.1272,1.6189,11.8571,2.9981,3.7193,3.0561,1.3466,6.6246,3.0191,1.9945,5.3275,0.5302,0.6589,5.5766,5.3757,1.0343,3.3665,0.7114,2.0929,2.6628,0.5253,2.214,1.6507,4.9301,4.314,0.0022,0.0017,0.0009,15.6716,9.8401,3.3362,2.9129,2.8532,3.1046,0.174,1.1089,4.0154,1.4725,5.2676,1.6333,1.0812,2.2345,2.2455,0.9248,0.8873,3.0304,3.885,4.109,4.3846,0.001,1.7564,3.526,0.5102,1.8651,1.583,8.21,0.1583,0.0316,6.3726,2.8974,4.0759,0.6749,2.809,4.1871,0.0091,0.4238,1.7413,6.9214,0.0389,3.7821,5.7829,1.0241,3.0212,1.8944,4.725,6.754,0.8527,2.8924,7.1845,1.3589,4.9225,3.8997,2.7342,0.0006,0.0019,0.001,0.4277,1.5252,1.6625,2.5476,4.2772,3.8298,1.4059,2.5839,0.3519,0.0839,6.9906,1.6859,0.9054,0.5713,1.4354,3.7981,2.2308,0.6122,0.035,3.6361,0.0657,2.3301,0.0038,0.0001,3.6533,1.3222,2.0742,2.7787,0.1421,1.0966,2.3826,0.0006,0.0078,0.0019,1.7025,2.3523,2.6347,6.1248,4.1642,6.5071,0.0331,3.7338,0.9803,1.8574,18.4027,4.309,2.3165,4.6601,0.2121,2.9128,2.6577,3.8554,1.8204,3.6853,3.5782,1.565,2.7933,5.0353,4.1456,5.1718,2.1895,5.2748,8.5754,0.7628,2.5729,3.7738,1.4362,2.2031,2.5689,4.7692,2.2992,4.3902,0.7846,3.4929,5.2709,2.0646,1.951,1.7442,0.2796,0.7212,0.1681,4.1474,1.8927,0.6925,2.9896,3.7687,0.0839,0.8192,3.1244,0.2357,1.5531,3.4178,3.1059,0.9039,3.7329,2.3189,7.3694,5.302,2.4571,3.3227,0.8638,0.0297,0.7434,2.5486,8.0721,0.0495,8.4926,6.81,5.1549,2.1819,1.1906,0.4295,3.9972,4.0774,5.3013,4.9302,0.2744,3.6984,2.8581,2.8409,0.9317,3.2776,0.4331,10.3068,0.7726,4.8557,7.5758,0.554,6.0971,2.2951,5.1125,2.687,3.801,1.3533,0.001,0.0715,1.6712,0.9538,1.7074,3.0884,3.4224,0.9838,2.5103,2.9756,4.6436,0.3277,0.9742,4.3191,6.1937,2.9372,1.0089,4.9088,1.3159,4.3708,0.1725,4.4634,0.4914,4.4983,0.8349,2.6147,0.4949,2.1084,4.3333,1.104,0.6096,0.8187,1.7426,2.5193,1.4127,4.0343,5.4333,0.0233,6.7948,3.3686,5.2435,1.2217,1.3937,2.7298,0.4463,1.0229,0.7159,2.8025,2.524,6.8029,1.3392,0.8041,1.9432,2.5611,4.1959,4.8149,0.0031,1.661,1.5708,0.664,0.6669,3.0645,1.0607,0.2944,1.1397,0.1585,2.4546,0.8192,0.8303,1.7093,3.7839,0.0038,1.0656,1.9916,4.5643,2.0069,0.5933,5.9775,1.6505,6.7446,1.1898,3.0848,0.1522,0.8081,1.9756,1.8278,0.5626,1.6124,5.9725,0.8941,4.8252,1.594,0.9542,5.0176,0.1928,1.2629,5.5182,0.3424,3.6577,6.4744,6.5864,7.5205,8.8205,0.0001,1.8704,3.1279,5.94,2.9146,3.4023,3.4657,1.6518,4.219,3.3163,0.0039,2.7114,5.7825,3.311,0.0167,3.95,3.3908,3.4174,6.3083,6.2595,2.1687,7.1905,1.9501,0.0007,1.6552,4.9674,5.0117,2.6391,0.0012,1.1301,0.0316,0.2074,0.822,0.4625,1.8413,5.2212,8.0138,3.2113,1.2956,4.6716,5.2737,0.4282,0.2712,1.7799,2.5467,3.483,1.3415,3.0928,5.2026,3.8551,5.3051,4.725,8.7555,1.0086,14.8913,10.3493,3.4019,7.1674,1.1609,1.3105,1.6473,3.0616,1.2392,0.13,0.4018,2.925,1.8269,4.0742,1.6679,2.7697,4.1537,0.0015,3.4686,5.5986,2.2124,0.8379,3.9961,0.0051,0.1709,0.4709,3.0483,4.1301,4.06,2.8716,0.0467,4.7235,0.7656,0.4819,3.7814,0.5346,6.4778,0.0288,4.2747,0.7415,4.8193,0.3936,0.5076,1.1541,2.0421,4.6477,6.2122,0.4101,6.0325,0.9805,3.5657,3.6304,1.8049,1.3604,5.0091,1.5338,0.8442,2.7698,6.9116,5.314,6.4959,4.8505,1.7251,0.1509,2.7738,1.5689,2.3686,1.2773,1.3814,0.0205,7.275,4.0863,1.304,1.3092]}
{"prompt":"Paraguayan Senator Mario Abdo Benitez , a lawmaker with ties to a former Paraguayan dictator , won the ruling Colorado Party s presidential primary on Sunday in a sharp rebuke for President Horacio Cartes ,","text":"Paraguayan Senator Mario Abdo Benitez, a lawmaker with ties to a former Paraguayan dictator, won the ruling Colorado Party s presidential primary on Sunday in a sharp rebuke for President Horacio Cartes, his political rivals say. Benitez, 56, won with about 30 percent of the vote, which comes amid heightened scrutiny of his record of voting for military authoritarian leaders in Paraguay, including Cartes s former mentor Alfredo Stroessner. Benitez, who lives in Miami, told his supporters his election was a resounding victory after decades of political repression. A former banker and former senator from the ruling party, he is considered a centrist. Abdo Benitez s campaign said that his main ally, current Paraguayan president Horacio Cartes, was at an event outside of his home in the evening hours, but there was nothing on his face to confirm that. In the run-off against Abdo Benitez, Paraguayan president Horacio Cartes was endorsed by the conservative National Movement, which led the country s 2016 election. Cartes appeared with the party s presidential nominee on Monday, the last day of campaigning, and delivered a speech in which he promised to create jobs and fight the crime. Cartes said that the president in office was now the opposition s main target, after years of criticism of the president s administration. Cartes has long denied having political ties to the Stroessner family, which ruled Paraguay from 1954 to 1989, and has claimed that the leader of the opposition leftist Party for Social Action, Fernando Lugo, has been part of a leftist dictatorship. Abdo Benitez was not identified by name by any news media. The race to the presidency is a close one and a close-run general election may determine the next president. The winner will take office in November 2018. A presidential candidate who won more than 50 percent of the vote in the January run-off could skip the election and win the second round, the electoral commission said. In Paraguay, the first election has a runoff. Cartes, an independent who has called for the resignation of the justice and finance ministries, won in the January run-off with about 50 percent of the vote. The candidate with most votes wins, but in cases where the candidates for third or fourth place come within one percentage point of each other, a run-off is held.","token_len":484,"entropy":[10.2561,3.3589,9.431,7.8246,5.485,6.1317,7.5615,2.6852,0.0032,1.6743,2.4219,5.6927,3.0367,5.4466,0.0036,4.2524,3.9746,7.1026,0.019,3.3708,0.6345,7.2078,1.2574,6.6579,10.7686,3.5067,13.3019,5.9095,2.6091,0.903,1.4636,3.582,0.9248,7.5502,2.839,3.7417,1.9764,7.4094,0.0085,1.1631,2.3372,2.0483,4.8022,4.228,2.8252,4.5735,0.0525,5.5426,0.0016,0.0003,1.3863,5.7813,0.0098,3.1896,3.1076,4.5962,3.2803,0.2256,0.1044,0.0455,0.0824,1.3391,4.2906,4.0297,3.5544,5.5843,3.4961,1.0031,2.0701,5.2229,2.6831,5.3973,1.8971,4.7837,8.9389,3.6547,2.1505,1.5821,0.0658,2.1837,3.0314,4.4475,0.2061,12.0796,3.1601,4.8468,5.8595,0.0125,6.3841,1.2464,0.036,0.6223,3.3652,0.0016,0.0006,1.7989,0.9205,4.8471,0.1178,5.0756,0.4098,4.9966,3.7827,0.2677,4.3906,3.9592,1.3554,1.372,5.7356,0.0123,0.842,4.9348,5.19,0.1849,3.6108,3.7403,1.0467,4.8269,2.8405,6.4015,1.2374,2.9577,4.0566,2.6643,1.8578,5.0182,2.5052,0.3045,1.4476,2.0715,3.6298,0.9464,3.7173,1.6808,5.0277,0.0092,0.1536,0.0013,0.0011,8.9632,3.8066,3.6673,3.1003,2.6351,5.4508,6.5053,0.9499,6.4903,2.7659,0.0278,1.7055,2.8032,0.0025,0.9584,0.1145,0.1578,1.5762,5.3332,5.21,4.7989,6.7306,2.2009,2.2665,1.59,1.0206,1.5951,8.0983,5.6005,2.3542,2.962,4.8054,0.5832,4.9663,4.0944,1.28,5.9594,2.2978,3.5833,1.1195,0.4294,4.3136,2.231,3.4792,0.2832,3.8768,4.9329,3.0837,0.0064,0.0174,0.002,0.0019,1.0907,3.6632,0.4879,3.6452,1.0307,0.0036,0.1399,0.007,3.2854,5.7648,0.0945,2.1834,4.0108,2.6732,3.8115,2.4052,1.3417,4.9583,1.4178,4.6126,5.048,6.6438,2.7229,0.6163,2.8803,0.0776,7.2571,3.4787,2.9122,3.0884,5.5406,1.8524,1.7122,2.815,2.9575,1.4199,3.5837,4.3015,0.4985,0.9331,2.8152,1.9314,1.4963,5.9691,0.471,1.0958,1.9842,0.7529,0.0416,3.2577,0.353,5.2785,2.0092,0.8474,5.3478,3.6887,6.2625,3.7941,2.6403,0.0387,2.5691,1.6885,2.2888,4.4353,6.7562,3.0449,2.3286,5.3799,2.7448,8.5373,5.6865,3.871,3.4458,1.7756,5.074,2.3961,0.0643,5.8197,1.4025,2.058,2.5067,1.0168,5.2217,0.7223,2.4271,0.0257,2.6764,3.5369,3.1347,2.9903,5.0768,0.7027,0.5751,1.4233,10.8317,0.0193,0.0361,0.5887,0.9722,1.5964,4.8381,0.2323,0.0827,1.5163,3.8882,0.1969,3.5319,1.9281,0.9513,1.5718,5.0102,0.8126,1.9134,6.2216,0.8452,0.596,5.4797,7.4551,3.3657,1.765,2.3696,5.2756,1.4335,6.6561,5.4956,0.0926,0.4056,2.941,1.6064,5.2225,0.0133,1.4543,6.8355,6.6135,0.8762,3.3646,0.009,0.0058,0.002,0.0023,3.607,3.8861,5.9775,1.3839,0.8309,3.3647,4.3931,3.6621,2.4332,1.1902,2.2111,5.6411,2.7352,2.9034,1.5076,1.8236,2.9692,2.7392,0.8538,3.3048,2.8794,2.194,3.9448,1.7121,4.5496,0.011,5.0794,4.4459,1.459,2.8864,0.8299,1.2826,1.9452,4.1099,2.0027,3.6988,1.627,1.0644,3.2994,3.6279,0.4407,3.8883,3.5464,3.0827,3.5488,3.0136,3.9009,0.3225,2.2862,0.0499,0.0877,0.1138,0.146,0.7879,1.3273,5.3757,5.9532,0.0566,0.0126,3.6916,8.2903,0.4644,2.6992,2.2669,4.2746,0.9108,4.7173,1.2241,1.9753,2.8644,5.3344,0.8981,0.3584,0.908,3.6924,3.866,0.1256,0.2711,1.751,3.7142,4.0026,3.9065,2.822,2.641,3.6173,6.3532,0.1158,1.8414,4.2248,2.8705,1.6137,1.5399,3.7778,0.2596,2.2976,3.134,0.0118,1.7502,7.003,6.4273,5.3315,3.2305,0.5098,2.4999,3.5782,1.9934,3.4413,3.0474,0.0342,0.0077,1.8225,2.2955,3.149,0.0803,0.163,0.0396,0.0939,0.4312,2.117,5.1025,2.9887,3.9521,1.2299,5.4175,2.3493,2.6204,3.8625,5.3991,0.555,1.274,3.9672,5.4223,7.5693,2.3905,0.1417,1.2108,5.7943,3.7409,3.1193,0.9657,0.0024,0.2336,0.5523,0.0055,0.2919,2.6388,7.2868,0.0816,0.0018,0.9947,2.1239,0.6605]}

The bill failed in a vote in the Senate, and McConnell has said he will bring it up again this year.\nIf lawmakers pass a tax bill based on what McConnell called the \u201cdeep tax cut\u201d proposal they agreed on in January, it would cut taxes on middle-earned households by $3,000 and those on high earners by $22,000 over several years, according to the Tax Policy Center.\nThe deduction for child and dependent care expenses could cost middle- to high-income families $200, with $500 more for single households.\nA tax bill that doesn\u2019t include the tax cut would be likely to fail, a tax policy center report estimates, since the House would likely be unable to muster enough support in the Republican-controlled House.\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill have said they\u2019re not inclined to support a tax cut that Republicans would otherwise be willing to support based on the tax plan presented in early January.","token_len":485,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6722,4.2536,0.76,0.6147,0.0004,2.0026,1.9819,2.6492,0.6174,1.4709,2.8373,5.3161,1.9861,1.8859,5.7954,0.4621,2.2204,0.0023,0.3724,2.2016,0.5263,7.5504,0.8484,0.8478,4.0883,3.2203,3.3688,3.8908,1.2092,2.3165,0.8704,0.0016,0.8211,0.884,0.8239,0.0104,0.6758,0.1674,22.7067,0.0001,5.3426,1.6098,1.045,3.937,3.7496,3.7001,3.3239,5.0979,4.7908,4.0057,5.5913,4.4288,3.9214,3.2884,0.5713,5.3508,1.0286,1.019,3.7212,1.9135,1.2982,1.7635,0.7956,1.6388,6.2464,4.4405,0.1133,5.0702,1.9186,1.1203,0.2434,19.1434,2.3074,3.8757,5.3488,1.4374,0.0016,1.7149,1.4532,2.5217,1.4647,0.1199,2.7028,1.0219,0.7004,0.8683,1.7227,6.1349,1.8984,4.3575,2.3418,0.079,3.0244,0.2599,5.5522,4.332,2.3407,1.432,1.4486,0.8233,1.2967,4.1399,0.2581,0.4613,0.4899,12.5337,0.4504,8.5458,8.1956,4.4719,0.1453,2.8745,6.0039,0.2146,4.3825,1.1745,0.3407,3.4536,1.2316,2.6856,2.084,0.0975,4.3875,2.5977,2.9446,3.0243,0.0,0.2697,4.7652,0.4442,5.3468,7.6068,0.8368,4.8816,7.2796,1.9271,3.1706,1.921,0.2107,2.649,0.4284,3.4036,1.0354,0.5458,2.001,3.5424,0.5345,1.2457,4.2342,3.4332,0.099,1.063,4.3929,2.3633,0.3221,0.9265,1.6618,5.6158,1.3527,2.6418,0.1058,3.8846,0.9443,5.096,4.9737,2.8994,5.2961,0.4286,0.9603,3.2862,0.0783,0.018,2.9948,1.3372,0.0602,5.8802,1.727,2.3267,0.8582,0.1796,0.8789,2.0214,5.0722,2.3382,3.3662,2.7926,3.2194,1.784,3.3543,3.3899,1.2398,0.4331,0.3184,1.6713,5.6869,1.7981,5.6354,4.5948,0.8545,4.8007,1.4478,4.1725,1.7852,6.0927,0.0132,0.0142,3.2312,0.5451,4.1243,1.0514,1.8598,2.2825,1.3607,1.7301,3.5375,2.2334,0.0388,0.0914,0.0912,0.1429,1.8782,1.157,1.5791,4.6449,4.1247,0.9584,5.9017,0.0007,3.9734,1.1139,1.6951,0.0029,3.1367,4.8559,4.0733,0.2865,1.1541,6.1058,5.9895,6.0113,1.9728,1.6121,4.6111,4.3623,4.1906,2.6902,0.6682,5.4492,0.6008,0.4055,2.4902,0.0842,0.1559,0.1644,1.7502,6.243,4.3834,1.6379,3.6058,1.2853,1.4112,1.9022,4.1682,0.1671,0.5843,0.0023,0.4075,0.1467,3.167,1.2062,2.8649,3.3022,2.531,3.9395,4.8783,1.509,2.1966,3.8716,3.5127,2.4669,4.3548,1.5911,1.0428,0.8111,5.8044,1.1899,0.4417,2.3162,2.8018,5.3185,1.4052,3.5174,2.2682,2.0447,0.5787,0.3104,1.7735,1.8942,4.6271,2.7342,0.855,0.7579,1.6567,5.3959,1.2234,1.143,0.9003,3.0057,0.6668,0.5254,0.1854,5.2102,5.1824,3.23,1.2662,1.3348,0.3364,5.7649,0.0435,4.1953,3.9822,3.6285,1.3406,16.728,8.5772,11.5048,2.8172,3.846,1.8757,8.0939,5.5679,5.0099,5.0672,1.2932,1.1586,0.847,0.4705,1.6946,0.1971,4.4538,2.0197,1.4323,3.69,0.1598,12.8352,7.3963,1.5146,1.5622,2.8635,1.3365,2.1358,1.646,3.4834,1.7316,3.1488,2.5657,0.2549,0.1275,6.0973,0.0016,0.3656,3.1056,6.4461,0.0559,1.4508,1.8948,0.0009,1.3102,2.0077,0.0835,0.0009,0.3148,0.3805,1.7213,6.6367,0.4932,4.5043,2.4503,2.9367,1.5119,1.5727,3.5174,5.5205,5.9092,0.0549,7.1528,1.8004,0.0011,0.1228,1.0939,1.6306,4.3649,0.741,9.9917,4.3733,4.3795,3.7135,1.5992,4.8851,4.6707,1.491,0.7109,3.9193,3.3758,1.1392,0.9675,4.6805,10.358,9.4405,0.8874,1.1546,1.4619,3.0057,1.3763,1.0392,2.8362,5.0396,0.076,4.1634,2.5945,4.7582,3.9013,2.1235,4.8663,3.95,5.0664,1.6211,3.6523,1.6999,2.9644,3.1558,2.2247,3.2697,2.1217,0.0084,3.7593,0.6392,1.5472,2.4024,0.4818,4.5491,0.3639,0.2577,0.8903,3.1348,0.3423,4.1124,2.6366,1.5234,0.0005,1.2274,1.8,0.7531,10.6493,0.9327,3.7413,1.7302,5.5899,0.0157,1.8755,0.6796,0.989,2.0425,1.3329,4.9549,2.4169,6.067,3.3272,1.6716,0.0026,2.0482,5.6897,0.0334,1.4676,3.3273,1.9143,6.4298,2.9843,4.6041,1.1101,0.3519]}

There is no such requirement under the existing framework for UK -European Union trade, a government source said.\n\"The Irish would prefer the UK not add specific wording around Northern Ireland to the agreement... if they want wording that would not undermine existing arrangements around Northern Ireland's backstop,\" the source said.\nA US -UK trade agreement could take 18 months to fully come into force, meaning Ireland should probably wait until later than the planned mid-November trading periods end to ensure Brexit does not hit a peak of consumer purchases during the Christmas shopping season in December, the industry body said.\n\"It would be helpful if there is clarity around what kind of clarity, in terms of a transitional period, the UK would be happy to have, before we would be comfortable with additional steps beyond what we are currently making in the context of the Northern Ireland backstop,\" said Joe Lynch, president of An Chomhairle.\nWith the negotiations facing delays with time running out before the UK leaves the European Union on Jan. 1 and no deal reached as of now, some politicians have called for hard Brexit to be postponed until after the end of the Brexit transition period.\n\"The longer we delay the negotiations, the longer it would take for a decision on Northern Ireland's future and the more likely it would be that we end up with no agreement on any of that,\" the trade organisation said.\nBrexit is complicated by the conflict in Ireland's north between communities loyal to British rule and republicans who want an independent state. The UK left a 27-year-old peace agreement last year as Britain prepared to enter its post-Brexit transition period.\nThe UK government is in talks with the EU on a trade deal, but the talks have stalled since October. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed on Friday to seek a hard Brexit no matter what the outcome of an upcoming trade agreement is.\n\"The government is determined to deliver a modern and ambitious withdrawal agreement with the UK,\" UK Brexit secretary David Frost said in a statement. \"We want to ensure that a better deal on our future trade relationship is found and signed.","token_len":486,"entropy":[7.647,5.6148,5.5421,8.4813,1.5831,1.0887,7.8507,2.062,4.1982,3.4046,3.939,1.9286,7.6238,0.2417,1.251,3.1304,1.0743,4.5348,0.0138,11.1176,5.2905,5.441,5.3691,0.0098,1.9393,2.2603,0.0707,4.0721,5.5813,3.3424,5.3652,0.3762,0.3835,3.6171,1.9182,2.1777,3.7788,7.2023,3.7707,3.1769,0.0023,3.8577,0.5032,0.1632,15.1744,6.0485,0.0247,0.1937,3.8678,8.9346,0.8003,5.18,3.261,0.4246,3.4638,0.1084,5.1046,0.4736,6.1286,1.0342,0.77,5.6607,4.2012,4.6814,0.4752,4.0914,5.7942,2.1847,5.3656,9.8241,6.0461,1.7478,3.9872,3.7811,5.267,4.3194,0.6199,0.4571,0.3071,0.2275,6.4889,1.3425,5.3417,5.6809,3.9638,2.4659,1.9424,4.0493,6.1015,6.6875,5.2021,6.0433,3.8496,0.0246,2.8144,0.8532,2.3076,7.1137,3.5668,1.8764,2.7854,9.585,1.0601,1.4919,2.5491,1.814,3.2622,2.3252,5.4974,1.7245,0.0079,3.9401,8.5686,5.7859,1.1139,0.9339,0.224,0.408,0.082,0.1883,3.1163,7.5634,9.1069,4.1121,1.0852,3.1594,3.6217,4.7987,7.0499,0.1819,0.6226,4.844,3.9443,0.412,0.3172,1.3948,5.5558,5.3207,5.0821,5.9441,1.0455,0.5539,5.279,3.2567,1.8229,6.499,6.1764,0.0639,4.9746,8.5567,8.0879,9.2558,2.2033,4.2208,4.9396,2.8938,0.0266,3.9959,4.7261,7.373,3.3188,8.487,7.2329,4.8495,0.9419,7.0025,2.4626,0.18,3.8121,3.4428,1.9292,1.1285,6.6761,3.9116,0.592,0.2056,0.1758,2.4871,2.7941,1.593,1.0472,5.2225,1.0769,2.9417,1.456,3.9022,2.7118,2.475,4.8576,0.0062,6.8851,4.8032,3.739,1.5825,0.0042,3.47,4.3816,0.5047,0.4747,2.1245,0.8414,1.696,2.2121,5.2588,0.3439,1.6206,2.9595,3.8623,3.4135,4.8332,2.3219,7.0489,0.9249,5.4724,5.2138,6.2747,3.0464,1.8862,2.0335,1.1202,5.1823,2.9602,0.8952,5.4822,0.0026,0.8668,3.5865,0.0328,6.5178,0.0166,0.8156,1.4646,6.3039,6.4624,0.1356,3.2528,0.1219,8.0355,8.9589,10.133,2.7674,4.5598,3.8744,0.289,5.9549,1.4586,5.2762,6.556,3.9445,4.9004,5.9474,3.1892,0.0375,3.0805,1.0494,1.7473,1.554,0.279,1.9688,0.1849,4.0681,3.8541,0.4903,2.1831,3.5363,4.9188,2.6646,4.7461,4.7734,1.4209,3.0789,0.1828,3.6733,4.8397,2.0112,3.2681,0.1793,7.7553,1.3959,2.9869,0.9295,4.0553,0.9597,0.9451,0.5928,2.6534,0.0022,0.5352,3.5892,7.0512,0.6892,0.7363,0.3837,2.5192,1.9595,5.8836,2.1135,2.5402,1.2997,3.2258,0.7212,0.0551,2.0661,1.0992,3.4716,0.2573,0.8463,3.1871,4.6412,2.015,3.6927,0.036,1.4151,0.5992,4.0972,1.5172,2.4563,2.3701,0.6135,1.3232,0.2338,0.9563,2.2272,3.8478,0.0913,0.7491,3.1282,2.0633,1.9313,3.5952,0.8361,3.619,0.7673,3.5885,5.0423,8.1253,0.7694,0.7302,0.3094,5.326,2.8129,7.3638,0.89,1.1791,7.0083,2.8869,3.9186,3.1468,3.9813,3.3872,9.4335,6.0591,0.0748,5.1292,0.5263,0.4007,6.3008,0.0252,1.2341,1.4954,3.5115,0.5563,1.47,1.314,2.053,2.6361,6.7797,4.0741,6.7123,0.1853,2.9708,0.7838,0.0385,5.892,2.1502,4.6462,0.4145,5.1664,4.9903,3.8598,0.2865,4.2937,5.187,3.6447,0.0089,0.1906,3.1696,0.4248,0.5812,0.5326,1.4922,2.4847,2.7934,2.2746,3.9537,0.7686,0.2309,1.2565,3.0833,1.8128,1.4697,4.3639,0.2503,2.2453,1.6341,2.0924,2.6004,1.4548,1.9202,2.8797,4.3351,1.68,6.2605,2.3998,0.0047,10.3399,0.0027,1.4265,4.2464,5.2529,2.6063,0.4501,3.5788,0.9448,4.7775,0.2366,6.8939,1.1798,0.6368,1.7646,0.8784,0.2395,5.0332,4.5009,5.7599,3.1773,4.7116,0.4136,0.4859,2.2948,1.9254,3.1772,1.5557,3.8387,0.1803,3.5281,1.7237,7.5218,1.7189,6.2842,6.5355,1.8332,2.5339,1.1915,1.8601,2.4702,5.6105,5.1922,2.6858,0.6453,16.2423,0.4577,0.7582,0.1783,0.1108,0.507,1.1394,1.5652,3.5252,0.6817,2.068,0.6331,3.7506,5.2134,0.9733,4.8865,2.9793,3.2088,2.7761,1.1378,1.4151,4.36,2.4576,4.5185,3.1036]}
{"prompt":"In a move certain to please conservatives , President Donald Trump on Friday added five names to his list of candidates for a prospective U.S. Supreme Court vacancy as he presses ahead with a campaign","text":"In a move certain to please conservatives, President Donald Trump on Friday added five names to his list of candidates for a prospective U.S. Supreme Court vacancy as he presses ahead with a campaign that he has touted as a fight to bring America back together.\n\u201cThis is our campaign to win America back again,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cFrom a Supreme Court that protects our borders and creates jobs and a fair tax code. To all our great Republican senators, Congressmen and State Legislatures in action, this election is very important to make sure Trump will win in 2020!!!\u201d\nAt least two of the five Supreme Court nominees added to Trump\u2019s list Friday would serve on the court\u2019s conservative side, and three would be justices who took their oaths over the past several decades. Trump has already nominated justices Anthony Kennedy, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch on the court, and nominated Neil Gorsuch to serve as Justices Kennedy\u2019s successor.\nIn the last 24 hours, Trump sent out five proposed appointees to the court, including former judges Donald M. Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia and former U.S. attorneys Roberta Spano and Michael Mulroy.\nThe move underscores how Trump has sought to shore up his conservative base after the election. Gorsuch was widely expected to serve on the court, and Trump was expected to confirm Trump\u2019s choice, but a dispute over Trump\u2019s legal authority led to his nomination being held in abeyance.\nThe proposed picks may not get enough of the 60 electoral votes needed to secure the Supreme Court, but Trump has been relying on his supporters across the country to encourage a second and, perhaps, final round of voting.\nTrump on Friday also unveiled a list of two Democratic senators, one of whom he appointed and the other one whom Trump has nominated in the past for the Postal Service, a Cabinet post that the Justice Department has sought to fill since 2015.\nTrump has long sought to secure Republican support for his proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known asObamacare, which would replace the national exchange with state-run exchanges designed to make it harder for the uninsured to gain coverage.\nThe Senate has twice already rejected Trump\u2019s proposal to repeal and replace the law, which he promised to defend no matter what. Trump\u2019s latest plan will require Senate approval a third time.","token_len":486,"entropy":[3.4603,4.7928,8.27,0.2714,4.9395,4.8605,0.4109,3.4718,2.316,0.0191,2.6339,1.6309,5.7531,6.4041,6.0455,0.123,1.1983,1.3085,0.102,5.7939,1.08,3.8886,8.6435,3.7579,0.0005,0.0032,0.0025,1.0125,0.001,1.4765,5.4103,1.6159,8.0211,1.394,0.0528,1.2576,3.718,1.7898,3.0914,2.7226,4.5413,0.1445,1.206,5.0036,1.6196,3.9782,4.6876,0.4967,3.8911,0.3591,0.1206,18.7167,8.2326,7.6294,1.1543,4.5173,4.7195,2.2145,3.0033,4.2626,0.0195,3.5418,2.052,6.9101,8.4574,2.658,2.1222,1.3442,5.1467,0.1228,6.7861,3.875,4.7344,0.0017,5.5449,5.7394,2.1834,3.2492,1.6553,4.8668,0.6377,2.4528,2.624,4.2552,2.7891,0.9634,1.4283,4.271,4.2393,3.3838,2.7759,7.1246,4.2321,1.0421,6.3308,0.8121,0.9676,6.4372,2.1442,1.4008,5.04,8.1635,2.1419,4.0617,3.9684,0.4365,6.2857,0.5336,1.9965,4.7421,1.1742,6.8424,3.6998,1.202,3.6608,3.6141,8.0663,3.1678,4.3609,0.9703,11.8481,2.5285,2.6153,1.1771,0.5332,1.4879,5.9701,0.0028,0.8794,8.0254,0.5878,1.282,12.7384,7.0908,3.3798,0.3777,5.9321,4.4768,4.5105,2.6444,0.3966,1.3591,10.1664,2.0323,0.0412,2.7696,4.6986,1.4149,3.0471,2.9826,0.9257,1.2277,4.8843,1.2531,6.272,3.321,1.5299,1.1008,6.4332,0.7677,1.7213,3.4107,1.3837,0.6845,4.6648,1.6664,3.4605,2.4641,4.4469,7.3739,0.1918,0.6622,2.6664,0.0106,0.0,0.9542,2.0858,0.0297,5.7725,0.5877,1.9199,0.7911,1.2306,5.0138,3.8072,0.0147,1.0157,3.9435,1.268,4.4131,0.0001,7.1481,6.8205,0.5618,0.9196,3.1093,0.6042,0.3091,3.0065,2.4462,3.5795,4.7428,0.0874,0.0847,1.65,6.7329,0.6333,5.113,9.6246,4.7922,0.0206,0.5118,0.6998,1.2742,0.996,1.7401,4.6683,5.307,6.2769,5.3609,0.0989,8.0882,0.2058,1.0425,2.8499,0.0002,0.0002,3.7703,2.589,3.1287,0.0004,0.0023,0.0005,4.9554,3.6702,4.7786,10.9766,6.6074,0.1631,4.2607,9.8301,8.6448,0.3291,1.0191,2.1499,5.0323,5.6537,2.4675,2.164,1.5285,3.9907,0.0759,4.4734,0.0055,0.6686,2.805,0.3113,3.7155,2.7367,2.3037,1.3439,7.7146,2.5218,4.3495,1.3252,0.0107,3.5321,1.4172,0.099,0.8277,1.307,1.8389,1.8717,3.7844,2.0583,0.0049,4.6929,4.5054,5.1434,0.1292,0.0037,3.4731,2.9735,4.3271,3.9449,7.373,0.8338,4.4837,1.3081,0.0153,0.0123,5.1736,4.8578,2.4116,0.2332,2.2355,2.6579,1.2588,5.7723,3.3422,6.6062,0.0004,0.0001,1.0022,0.5741,2.3138,6.4141,4.1394,5.477,2.002,4.592,2.579,4.2729,1.5955,5.5828,6.4474,0.0279,0.6667,0.1709,3.3728,0.7254,2.7734,0.0014,1.3018,0.8171,2.9846,1.3717,3.136,6.1938,0.3923,2.3087,3.0665,5.7184,0.0663,0.6163,0.4981,6.8965,4.1102,5.1184,5.0795,6.8114,2.7467,0.8543,2.5444,2.2764,0.0792,2.2378,1.178,0.7494,2.7867,4.4628,0.4117,2.3772,4.699,0.968,1.8858,0.0292,5.7099,5.044,1.4883,2.5672,3.0734,1.0847,0.1129,2.6761,4.9763,5.6396,2.9427,0.1196,4.3115,4.4169,4.1661,1.5529,2.2878,4.4548,1.4324,0.3552,5.2404,1.2893,13.0671,0.0177,2.4544,3.0126,5.7666,2.4608,1.4462,4.0848,5.807,0.0059,1.3397,5.0611,0.1018,1.4538,4.0011,4.4167,0.0878,0.4854,2.6168,1.9067,4.5469,2.3494,0.1855,5.5281,4.578,1.4052,0.7045,0.9135,5.6174,0.4724,2.8199,2.4305,0.0559,0.0012,0.0015,0.6325,5.1416,0.0592,8.1248,0.0,0.571,1.7137,3.4722,3.8858,1.121,8.331,6.7491,2.0386,7.0739,0.3459,0.2658,0.4818,5.5277,0.0696,3.924,0.6649,2.7354,0.1684,4.9082,1.1335,0.1241,5.2408,0.852,0.6968,0.9538,2.1311,3.6144,2.3883,5.1399,4.4427,2.9546,2.2991,2.8912,0.0121,0.001,1.1372,1.0822,1.5695,1.7967,0.0026,0.5534,1.4015,0.6572,2.5619,2.8256,5.5823,1.3221,5.3955,9.0838,0.0454,0.5383,1.1288,3.728,2.4456,0.0064,0.0041,4.7453,2.9187,4.3738,3.4241,4.6056,3.1084,7.1433,3.8787,0.019,1.605]}

On a","text":"An ideologically divided U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday handed a win to Republicans in Texas by putting on hold rulings that said electoral districts drawn by state lawmakers discriminated against minority voters. On a rare unanimous vote, a three-judge panel in Austin decided that such boundaries may be challenged by voters in elections.\nThe ruling will mean that voters and local officials can challenge some boundaries in the next elections as soon as next year, long after they have passed.\n\u201cThe court has been very reluctant to pass down retroactive rulings. But they have been very sympathetic to people who have been denied their rights or discriminated against in our elections,\" said the chief justice of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott and his allies in the Republican-controlled state Legislature have resisted calls to revise the redistricting maps that are at the center of a bitter political feud that pits minorities against whites and conservatives against liberals.\nThe Texas Supreme Court ruled in December that election maps drawn by state lawmakers that excluded Hispanic residents from three city districts violated civil rights laws. The court said the maps could be challenged by black residents of those cities after the next election, rather than in 2018, as some had demanded.\nThe Austin panel agreed with the Supreme Court, ruling that there had been no discrimination in the elections of 2017 or 2018 on the basis of race, but allowed the case to proceed until the end of the court\u2019s term, when justices will retire and new justices take office.\nThe ruling is potentially much easier on local governments in Texas, which have been facing intense redistricting scrutiny in recent years for refusing to change election districts drawn by state legislators.\nTexas had the fourth-largest gerrymandering problem in the nation, after Michigan, Texas and Pennsylvania, according to a 2020 report from the non-partisan Government Accountability Project.\nAbbott, a Texas Republican, has taken sides in the constitutional challenge surrounding the state\u2019s redistricting, arguing that the lawsuit was aimed against the president and disingenuous in having voters challenge election maps drawn by representatives. Republican legislators supported a recent court decision that expanded a congressional redistricting proposal to cover all of Texas.\n\u201cThe Texas Legislature had already done its part to close the racial gap,\" he said. \u201cNow we must pass legislation and a constitutional amendment to ensure that the court will uphold the rights of all Texans\u2014no exceptions.\u201d","token_len":486,"entropy":[12.2974,4.6761,4.614,0.0451,0.0119,0.0764,4.4574,0.0015,3.9416,1.8294,5.475,2.7319,5.686,0.1501,4.6312,1.1779,5.7912,3.404,6.1672,3.9096,0.9458,7.2423,1.0149,5.1754,10.0409,2.8578,6.9571,0.4507,4.6158,3.054,8.5006,0.042,1.9935,0.1335,0.3946,7.0631,2.6065,6.0271,4.6454,0.3713,0.2819,2.8417,2.9096,0.0153,0.4284,0.0002,0.26,2.8053,2.1366,3.4988,0.8552,5.3897,6.3709,5.495,1.2362,4.4769,2.41,2.6919,1.2721,4.595,5.4458,0.5566,15.3948,1.935,3.7379,5.0165,0.6965,3.0211,5.5656,3.8758,0.9527,1.697,4.6444,4.6851,5.1539,1.8611,2.5273,3.3044,2.7046,4.0909,5.7027,0.0013,2.4601,0.9248,0.796,7.6799,0.7796,3.5664,1.2087,3.8959,6.5232,0.5831,10.4349,8.5177,4.5234,3.1505,3.2627,3.2734,4.6316,4.239,0.0676,6.0686,5.5861,7.3612,0.2335,3.2504,3.1874,1.8541,4.0144,1.8913,1.5444,3.5551,6.3394,0.2356,5.1884,0.4886,1.8678,1.981,4.2163,2.8651,2.1099,3.9405,5.1826,0.0408,1.7456,5.9465,1.1316,2.2492,0.3541,5.1498,3.9107,0.214,0.72,0.1313,6.567,0.3082,1.453,0.0326,0.0034,1.347,0.2884,4.4798,4.3832,0.2237,0.0,3.0173,2.2512,3.7969,1.8993,0.4633,1.9841,1.0571,0.4772,2.3793,1.1217,1.1865,5.5642,3.0179,0.9197,5.7429,0.9413,4.0868,0.0004,2.1355,2.4275,3.0747,5.9912,1.3675,0.8598,0.0009,1.4465,3.907,2.4866,4.4174,2.4688,2.6569,7.4983,0.7683,1.0651,1.2071,3.4291,0.0988,2.1673,0.2186,0.4198,1.6228,2.3628,2.347,0.0043,3.3312,1.3672,3.6977,0.2831,5.4464,3.0289,1.534,0.4045,2.3203,1.0583,3.5686,3.2999,4.023,3.5092,1.0303,5.8324,6.307,2.2438,4.5194,8.0023,0.0211,0.9182,0.6355,1.6909,2.1886,2.1808,1.2729,1.4133,3.7764,1.3299,0.4435,1.4269,5.8274,2.8745,1.6482,3.2506,3.3136,5.7727,1.7047,3.9041,0.6894,1.6529,5.6264,0.0025,3.147,6.3391,1.8147,2.803,3.7396,3.6858,5.6869,0.1818,0.2588,1.496,5.9991,8.9687,4.4694,0.8948,0.5606,4.5509,0.0014,2.7025,2.7542,0.3127,4.5547,3.9428,0.1473,0.6034,3.1813,1.6362,1.0462,4.8355,2.1733,6.722,3.3514,0.8318,4.7203,0.8659,0.3258,0.036,0.3219,1.5069,3.3836,5.8401,1.4031,4.9547,0.0872,0.894,5.2026,1.2076,3.9129,0.0502,0.8482,4.3585,17.2741,6.9709,5.1972,0.5431,2.5988,2.9854,4.2178,1.3104,5.3033,3.3237,6.9864,3.1776,4.8284,2.3016,0.1871,0.3043,1.4708,2.4382,2.6891,7.0085,6.4169,4.6239,2.7715,5.204,1.5947,2.702,1.781,1.3114,1.8323,1.1479,1.8461,4.3834,3.6176,6.2683,0.0044,5.2386,1.8545,0.3373,0.0881,3.9079,5.403,0.0435,4.6384,4.275,1.362,3.1079,0.2567,2.6342,1.527,0.6069,0.5936,3.5775,4.8744,4.4853,4.3488,0.287,1.3516,7.1173,0.0001,0.2835,0.298,3.5092,0.3118,0.5539,0.8204,1.2124,3.395,3.6439,0.8712,5.0242,0.7326,2.8925,1.3253,1.7681,0.0012,1.3117,10.7671,2.6698,1.801,0.2267,6.6613,0.2382,0.0243,5.9598,0.0438,3.4647,0.3699,0.8183,6.2663,0.0458,2.3178,1.5435,4.8836,0.4385,0.4608,1.5939,5.1943,7.3267,0.4965,0.8751,7.9338,2.2808,9.1146,0.6233,2.6411,11.4953,1.3359,0.0214,2.8232,0.0003,2.083,1.4482,0.3073,1.2997,7.7281,2.4778,5.3391,6.5515,1.7486,6.2906,1.1345,13.5801,2.1092,2.6185,7.2876,5.5139,7.0184,4.6307,1.0819,0.755,0.1965,6.553,3.9245,5.9336,2.7817,7.6511,2.4332,6.1988,3.7556,1.5546,0.9304,5.3462,3.3832,4.9326,2.0183,0.0002,4.9373,1.282,3.0528,2.2655,2.4414,0.8862,0.9599,0.337,2.594,0.1902,1.4813,1.6258,2.9508,3.6676,3.318,5.4759,2.8065,0.6346,1.2192,5.8778,1.0282,4.3295,1.8257,10.9815,4.2447,0.1243,0.7708,6.0157,0.0212,5.958,5.7796,3.2067,4.7194,3.3504,4.1826,5.7599,2.6398,0.0829,0.7194,2.2859,0.704,2.4221,4.9049,2.5836,2.6496,0.944,3.3873,0.1228,1.0616,0.6427,6.578,4.3355,6.4875,1.9444,3.6145,6.9822]}

in the country under the government s industrial strategy plans after Brexit.\nA group of senior executives came together on Wednesday to express how the world s largest health technology and pharmaceutical businesses are determined to work with Boris Johnson on his industrial strategy.\nBritain s prime minister delivered a speech on industrial strategy on March 12 that outlined a vision for how the country could revitalize its economy.\nThe government plans to have a draft industrial strategy on its desk by April 7 before holding a public consultation.\nOne major pharmaceutical company highlighted at last week s meeting said he plans to build a huge new manufacturing hub in a city in the South East.\nCraig Giesbrecht, director of global strategy, Roche Pharma UK, noted in an interview this week that the group is looking at the South East.\nThe company was one of several leaders who met in London at the end of last week to express commitment in supporting the government s efforts to reform the UK health care system.\nRoche (Roche.AX) Chairman and CEO Severin Schwab talked about his interest in investing in the UK ahead of the industrial strategy plan, in The Spectator newspaper published on Tuesday.\nThe paper highlighted that other companies like AstraZeneca (AZN) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) (GSK.L) are part of the group of firms that are pushing for government

{"prompt":"The Austrian far-right Freedom Party ( FPO ) has agreed to rule out a referendum on Austria leaving the European Union as part of a coalition deal with conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz , FPO","text":"The Austrian far-right Freedom Party ( FPO ) has agreed to rule out a referendum on Austria leaving the European Union as part of a coalition deal with conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz, FPO spokesman Wolfgang Kubicki has said.\nMr Kubicki said last week that the FPO planned to ask the public to back a possible referendum next year on Austria's relationship with the EU. Mr Kurz has called for a referendum on EU membership, arguing that a breakaway would make it easier for Austria to negotiate a trade deal with the United States.\nMr Kubicki, a member of Austria's national parliament, said the FPO and Mr Kurz's ruling coalition would work towards a referendum in January. \"The proposal was accepted today [Tuesday],\" he said. \"We have made a decision to hold the referendum.\" FPO vice-chairman Norbert Hofer, who has criticised an open European borders policy, said his party \"will respect the result of it for the benefit of the [Austrian people], for the benefit for the European Union.\"\nAustria's federal parliament voted in June to extend the country's membership of the EU, after which Mr Kurz warned of the risk that a referendum by Austria to decide on membership would lead to an opening up of the country's borders for the unregulated flow of migrants from neighbouring countries.\nWhile Austria is not a member of the Schengen zone, it has opened its borders to other EU states for a short period allowing people to cross into the Schengen zone without checks at borders. The Schengen zone is a customs union, meaning there are no checks at internal borders.\nMr Kurz last month criticised EU policies and argued that member states should be more active in dealing with illegal migration, saying: \"If you take the view that we only have the duty to stop illegal illegal migration at the borders, then it has to be said today: We are doing well. This is our strategy.\"\nIn an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian, Mr Kurz said he would discuss the possible referendum with his colleagues, adding that if they supported it, he would ask other members of his parliamentary group to do the same.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on August 11, 2018, with the headline 'FPO, Kurz coalition agree on referendum'.

The consequences are to prevent U.S. companies from participation into the Russian company\u2019s activities,\u201d Sibur Chief Executive Officer Alexander Lukin told Dow Jones Newswires.\nThe company said it believed its business activities were not in violation of U.S. sanctions, including the 2017 sanction against Burisma. The sanctions were lifted in January.\nThis week, the U.S. Department of Justice began to question the owners and lawyers of Burisma and its parent company, the oil-backed Rusal.\nU.S. sanctions against Burisma were imposed last month in response to human rights violations in Ukraine and Russia's annexation of Crimea.\nSibel's business activities include controlling operations in five U.S. states: Minnesota, South Carolina, North Dakota, Montana and Colorado.\nThe company said on Monday that it had sold its U.S. assets to a company owned by its U.S. partner, the Houston-based Houston Petroleum Company.\nThe transactions closed in June, the company said, and had not been reported to U.S. regulators. That would have triggered an investigation for trading with a sanctioned company, the company said, adding it expected to file the results with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\u201cThese transactions with Houston Petro did not violate anything, insofar as the transactions were clear and had no impact whatsoever,\u201d Lukin told Dow Jones Newswires.","token_len":487,"entropy":[9.9526,0.9865,0.4206,10.1227,11.1873,5.9772,6.8058,2.8116,2.1094,1.5453,1.513,4.5412,5.038,5.0038,0.0504,5.9016,0.0107,0.0487,0.1008,9.7429,0.7345,0.0255,0.0031,0.0005,2.8939,1.8182,3.1128,5.4954,0.5518,5.8004,5.734,1.2936,2.1044,3.9028,4.5273,0.1947,3.5306,2.6321,1.3783,1.058,2.4002,0.4695,2.2204,1.6413,0.0064,0.7364,4.1791,0.1961,0.2697,0.1294,0.1704,16.2969,12.9413,7.8911,0.0724,3.0038,4.5163,5.5302,6.7461,1.527,2.5897,7.7722,3.9437,0.2813,0.4968,3.7201,0.0007,0.0029,0.0528,0.3431,2.4529,8.3444,3.4097,3.6053,4.4185,1.2329,1.4478,2.862,1.8711,5.684,2.5664,9.3848,0.4245,4.4731,1.305,0.3475,2.1627,3.1606,7.0843,2.4183,2.2422,0.1625,0.0649,1.8232,0.0452,0.9421,2.4204,4.0403,2.8064,4.6485,0.1142,2.1118,5.2498,2.6298,3.1027,0.2222,3.0571,5.5987,0.4176,0.7278,0.7462,3.2439,1.3543,6.3272,0.0031,2.225,1.1155,2.3172,1.1425,4.8336,0.3908,0.8605,2.5622,3.5831,4.0808,1.998,1.5682,6.0462,17.401,8.8301,3.0275,7.4054,2.5663,4.4223,4.0005,3.8744,7.0372,3.0805,2.9813,2.8949,1.2871,1.1709,0.0004,0.0023,0.1297,7.3603,1.2035,0.4318,2.3518,1.4405,1.3242,2.7444,1.5127,1.3337,2.4292,1.9392,7.4237,5.1804,1.0893,2.287,2.0351,3.4186,3.2216,4.8247,5.9769,8.2208,3.8214,1.1083,10.483,0.0358,2.2469,1.8952,0.7834,4.049,3.3152,2.2209,3.8412,1.2805,0.293,4.6752,1.2686,2.6422,1.6542,2.7512,3.9686,0.0014,0.0029,0.272,1.5284,2.2356,7.6067,9.2884,0.0582,1.6533,5.5769,1.6779,2.1867,6.6861,2.0789,4.9193,5.0652,3.4882,0.0008,0.002,0.1188,0.6641,0.2928,10.0079,8.3993,1.6675,2.1854,6.7676,7.9343,6.9851,2.5231,2.0253,1.8481,4.4052,5.6297,2.1744,2.7778,5.1628,0.1306,2.2713,3.9012,4.8103,4.6042,1.9311,8.6608,0.0313,2.5173,0.077,0.0764,1.2503,0.2028,2.1098,2.0633,1.2428,1.1558,5.2094,2.7606,2.5647,1.2454,1.3251,1.5502,2.3589,1.2033,0.0288,2.0111,0.0004,0.0049,0.0061,0.4187,1.6974,4.2406,1.4049,7.6489,5.7844,1.996,2.1277,0.0004,2.0439,2.8952,2.3057,1.1419,4.0607,1.4955,2.9721,1.3793,0.2109,5.7491,4.0451,0.3324,1.7054,1.4662,0.0003,0.0129,0.0041,2.1675,0.0005,0.5047,4.6455,3.4986,3.9567,2.2232,8.7126,3.2134,8.0176,0.406,2.0739,0.0006,2.9965,2.6148,3.2058,0.5489,0.7747,3.2409,6.202,2.0617,6.6743,4.6913,3.4907,3.1376,0.9387,3.2671,0.0009,0.0037,0.0056,3.2153,1.7583,0.442,0.001,2.2444,2.2617,3.5981,1.8849,2.6222,1.3715,0.0017,7.8879,0.0403,1.0219,1.2947,1.7337,1.7524,2.3513,2.4941,1.2643,0.0136,0.1953,0.891,0.8149,3.1491,0.8266,2.4382,4.6561,2.6412,3.7992,5.9154,6.3111,0.5136,5.6136,2.6836,0.0005,0.0028,0.2626,1.8597,2.4831,5.6776,0.0868,4.8088,1.136,0.0751,3.3361,0.9735,0.4286,3.6631,0.5395,3.8987,0.125,0.6565,2.0839,1.6416,1.7431,2.1711,0.1538,0.7913,0.7782,1.1708,6.0684,1.8438,3.3822,0.0021,0.0032,0.334,3.8627,0.661,2.5492,3.5863,3.2788,0.1183,3.8593,3.6989,0.0017,0.0127,0.5583,1.5979,0.9742,2.5211,7.345,0.3329,0.006,5.9169,5.6879,2.3214,0.6859,0.6849,1.867,5.9913,6.3647,2.5074,3.1216,1.4793,2.6767,0.3669,0.0759,1.9603,1.1192,5.1407,1.9654,0.5772,3.4983,0.674,1.8843,0.0003,0.0017,0.0016,1.6887,0.6178,6.421,4.1556,1.5735,4.8677,2.9646,1.096,5.9521,8.5032,4.7685,1.9108,5.5866,1.6817,1.1299,1.6462,0.1287,0.1209,2.488,1.5255,2.8654,4.3543,0.9243,2.7714,4.011,5.3982,3.0109,0.2702,1.8008,0.0028,0.0004,0.0037,1.146,0.1793,2.5222,0.6514,7.0207,1.3057,5.8253,3.7817,5.6042,7.5528,0.0367,1.5332,7.4934,4.305,10.31,0.0026,1.5066,2.2802,0.7573,8.9342,1.1417,5.62,1.3888,2.3957,5.0983,2.038,3.2006,2.5067,4.358,0.0042,1.9715,0.1341,0.0062,0.1176,0.0003,0.0708,0.1882]}

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius criticized Iran yesterday as he accused the Islamic Republic of seeking to extend its power in the region and for expanding its military presence in the Mediterranean Sea. While the Iranian government insists it is targeting an Israeli-headed military coalition, the Western world sees Iran\u2019s interests as extending to the Gulf and wider Middle East.\nThe United States said on Monday that it is not concerned about Iranian-backed Iranian-backed militiamen in a rebel camp in northern Syria.\n\u201cIt appears clear to us that the overwhelming majority of the milities operating in Northern Syria have Iranian or Iranian-aligned roots and are under Iranian supervision, whether direct or indirectly,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew wrote in a letter to Trump.\nThe U.S. said Friday it had cut off some Iranian assets related to their trade in Syria, including bank accounts with assets of $1.4 billion.\n\u201cThe United States will not accept the use of Iran\u2019s banking and financial system for proscribed activities in Syria, or the support of Iranian militias in Syria and in any conflict over the region,\u201d Lew said.\nLew\u2019s letter came amid a number of escalating U.S. policy actions against Iran since Trump\u2019s inauguration, including two sanctions prohibiting U.S. firms and individuals from doing business with Iran\u2019s foreign banking system.\nLast month, Washington halted the work of five Iranian companies involved in the construction of an oil refinery in Iraq, which Tehran said was necessary for boosting Iranian exports of oil and gas. The U.S. government on Tuesday stopped U.S. financial support for the National Council of Resistance of Iran after the UN General Assembly voted unanimously to impose sanctions on the organization Thursday.\nIn May 2017, U.S. president Donald Trump imposed sanctions through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act on a number of countries involved in U.S. national security policies or Iran\u2019s policy, including Syria\u2019s government, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Iranian foreign ministry, the Iranian Revolution Guards, Hezbollah, Tehran\u2019s ambassador in Syria and the Hezbollah military commander in Syria.","token_len":488,"entropy":[8.0143,10.6828,0.999,8.1668,4.8478,9.0838,6.0042,3.4962,1.7872,1.1418,8.9033,3.5882,1.3273,3.7049,1.7354,3.5627,4.5723,4.8066,4.3548,0.8716,4.5849,3.2695,2.5011,4.2736,4.0548,0.2035,5.7429,0.0652,6.1672,0.4486,1.1188,1.0532,4.3058,6.4407,0.0221,2.3506,2.2568,2.5067,4.7977,1.1346,1.1221,1.0639,0.6855,5.8168,1.1878,0.0311,0.1182,0.0023,0.0,4.9535,1.6353,8.8066,3.4704,6.3708,4.4177,2.3215,2.8328,0.1915,0.0648,4.1574,0.5337,5.3576,0.2684,4.4177,2.1675,0.7375,0.9578,2.2461,5.9435,5.0594,0.2303,2.9215,0.9579,0.776,1.1208,2.5604,2.6067,0.4278,6.5363,2.357,3.2098,2.1275,4.0692,0.992,0.8762,5.3815,4.0294,5.5689,2.5284,7.4626,3.6348,5.9189,0.8444,1.8831,4.8643,4.2567,3.2407,1.457,15.4387,8.2143,1.8848,6.3148,1.057,6.5597,4.4013,1.0605,3.2234,1.6242,6.9934,2.5215,0.0069,0.6102,1.9685,7.7376,2.9998,0.2196,3.9268,2.7358,1.8835,0.5687,0.9613,2.6649,2.9435,3.4925,0.5897,2.7716,4.1044,0.8518,5.772,1.8982,0.2605,5.6645,0.7027,0.0024,1.3986,5.8749,8.2831,5.3146,0.7074,3.0081,0.5011,1.1743,1.6191,7.5622,5.412,7.3249,5.1492,6.0358,3.1168,1.194,0.1648,1.3433,7.478,0.8355,0.102,1.202,11.7083,8.9965,6.5057,0.4155,6.0152,0.1794,2.9022,5.1235,3.7725,2.2847,0.4139,5.3403,6.5908,2.2916,2.1654,5.0723,2.2631,3.4783,1.9339,5.355,5.4818,0.1636,2.6634,1.1315,3.3382,7.1078,5.4132,0.0044,0.0905,0.0512,6.22,0.9596,3.3391,0.0569,4.7639,0.5152,0.497,0.9546,0.2673,5.3596,1.3885,0.8277,1.955,2.6385,0.0008,0.0231,0.1031,3.3659,5.6955,1.7055,2.585,7.1594,1.0668,4.75,3.34,3.3102,7.3004,0.0047,5.2475,8.7365,2.2475,1.6851,1.1518,1.9594,6.9604,0.1776,4.5642,5.3714,1.6486,2.3747,2.2802,0.5418,2.3657,0.1401,1.4829,0.91,2.5564,0.7034,1.5816,2.2663,0.0548,3.4177,1.9314,3.3512,2.6173,4.0356,0.0744,4.3231,5.3217,0.1876,0.0307,7.6283,2.2697,0.8714,2.0079,2.1909,7.7277,2.2195,0.5198,2.0343,1.4477,0.9286,4.3751,2.6043,4.8268,0.4977,3.4378,3.2929,1.6065,1.5917,2.8322,2.8651,5.0322,4.2491,4.9002,1.5965,2.6284,0.8259,4.0332,1.5441,3.9987,0.795,0.4337,0.3721,9.0089,7.4474,1.7496,6.0881,0.2925,3.0326,3.2155,1.6745,5.5838,0.0045,4.9921,2.4313,0.0009,0.1542,0.5666,4.4177,4.069,2.1858,0.5331,3.1644,2.7714,6.8605,0.2453,0.0232,1.7581,1.9451,0.3615,6.3913,3.718,7.5919,3.9766,0.0003,0.02,0.0187,3.9305,3.3905,1.0839,0.0815,2.585,0.004,0.3911,0.6185,3.2306,0.0231,0.023,3.5477,4.5971,2.0397,0.5696,0.5362,4.6598,2.4815,0.1804,3.8316,6.276,1.7968,5.1456,0.1635,4.6849,1.266,2.8549,4.1588,0.0667,1.462,3.0156,0.1822,2.6699,1.7191,2.1639,0.3877,3.3066,1.1101,3.3216,3.7003,2.3446,0.8735,5.2319,2.0574,7.0237,4.1302,2.2108,2.75,2.1984,1.6803,1.1475,0.8919,2.0851,2.5365,0.0006,0.0169,0.0447,3.8637,4.863,2.1205,4.7351,4.2677,0.0008,0.0766,0.2876,4.3748,2.4023,0.7562,1.3585,6.3058,5.7811,0.44,2.9561,1.8335,0.5401,4.579,1.957,6.6362,4.3835,0.0003,1.5711,2.9946,0.4145,2.6751,0.8586,0.6036,1.6333,3.3487,8.5793,0.4047,0.4061,3.0481,4.1407,4.7217,0.0495,2.7892,0.0004,0.0388,0.054,6.4787,0.3628,0.0343,4.9663,1.6841,7.8094,1.3898,2.8198,3.7704,0.0043,0.0009,0.6243,1.8643,4.4398,0.8797,0.0014,2.8719,3.6524,0.0583,6.07,0.0005,0.0299,1.5273,4.9874,0.1778,4.2977,6.3047,6.2966,1.2805,0.0374,0.0048,4.2597,3.0473,0.3968,3.282,4.5108,0.0205,0.069,2.0335,1.3947,4.0451,0.4578,0.0016,0.0174,7.3471,0.0825,1.5201,3.1592,2.5143,5.0628,1.7324,0.6666,2.0132,2.2333,7.1902,0.088,1.665,3.4953,0.7247,7.4408,2.857,0.0032,0.0614,6.8325,2.7809,4.1013,1.1293,1.1816,4.6125,3.3398,3.3277,1.594,2.0785,0.2963]}
{"prompt":"British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday she would continue to govern in the interests of all Northern Ireland and uphold the agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence in the province . The","text":"British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday she would continue to govern in the interests of all Northern Ireland and uphold the agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence in the province. The comments came after the Supreme Court ruled May was still in her rightful position as leader, despite the breakdown of the Belfast peace process. May also said she would not resign on April 11, as her party demanded, to preserve what remained of the Brexit process. The British government has been under pressure to act after the European Court of Justice ruled May broke the EU\u2019s Brexit treaty, effectively giving Britain the right to end the 31 July transition period, even if the EU has not yet done so. May told the BBC that she had no wish to be a part of what she called divisive politics. Asked if she would continue in office if this is the case, she replied: \u201cAbsolutely we will and I\u2019d urge colleagues to consider joining me in respecting our own and each other\u2019s political positions and the fact that there is an opportunity to engage on issues to do with Northern Ireland and the border with Ireland. In a statement issued Friday night after Friday\u2019s verdict, May said she has a responsibility to \u201ccontinue to govern in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland and uphold the Good Friday Agreement which was signed between the UK Government and the Provisional Irish R\u00e9publique. \u201d She will now seek a review of the constitutional crisis that has led to the Brexit impasse. \u201cI have a responsibility to the people of Northern Ireland and I\u2019m acting on the advice of all my cabinet members who will have further conversations and will advise me on next steps. \u201cUntil then, it\u2019s up to me to look out for the people of Northern Ireland, who remain committed to the Good Friday Agreement and who are looking to see the best possible future for the Union. It appears that one of the main objections to May\u2019s government\u2019s deal with the EU came from unionists in Northern Ireland who had concerns about it not providing for a secure border with Ireland as well as a free and single market to which they had been promised. The government had vowed to resolve both issues in a further separate negotiations agreement, but the court found that \u201cthat was not an obligation of the transitional period agreement \u2013 which was to cover only the transition to British law until 31 December \u201d.","token_len":488,"entropy":[8.686,0.0211,2.7836,0.002,2.8423,2.1257,2.1078,2.2192,1.5224,4.5695,0.4733,8.702,2.1852,1.0464,3.083,0.0013,3.3656,5.8895,0.3404,2.5034,9.1434,0.5769,6.5404,2.488,4.7661,4.1379,0.0154,3.8995,0.8587,1.9036,1.1085,3.9587,0.2067,5.6525,6.2479,0.8076,1.2656,1.6129,5.9355,0.0476,1.4737,4.4685,2.8908,3.9423,2.2259,2.7836,5.0024,3.1071,1.8326,1.7729,3.303,2.5704,1.6554,7.1289,0.307,0.8349,4.6618,3.4724,0.2947,0.6041,2.9128,3.5871,1.4764,0.6453,0.6588,1.9598,3.9607,4.9705,5.9508,3.6454,1.8362,3.5185,3.0666,2.1579,6.1466,1.8729,3.5626,6.6531,5.6458,4.7128,0.0266,0.8929,8.2761,2.6756,0.2925,2.5273,5.1995,0.8242,1.5335,2.0834,3.2678,0.3086,0.6214,4.3969,2.2089,1.4588,4.2043,0.7704,0.0375,0.1293,0.6867,2.4767,6.965,0.9286,3.9371,15.8393,7.6064,3.4045,3.7616,4.9511,2.2081,4.4501,3.3685,2.7991,1.4954,0.6194,0.0297,5.7125,1.1572,7.612,3.6619,6.9058,0.6554,2.8631,4.6896,1.2102,2.064,2.752,4.0371,1.9548,1.5576,4.5343,0.0168,0.0972,2.174,3.7389,1.5377,1.232,1.5785,0.7537,2.1076,2.8629,6.6731,0.0396,3.5653,2.7588,2.5631,0.0026,5.189,2.1314,0.5529,8.7901,1.8677,0.8715,5.3097,1.1653,0.3256,1.0198,2.524,2.8979,3.4985,2.022,6.3358,4.5436,1.9725,0.1367,0.143,0.6624,1.8964,0.2149,8.3922,6.26,5.7439,6.0635,0.6415,4.8395,2.1773,14.9658,0.2121,4.9705,8.0096,6.3635,0.6443,4.8758,7.1299,2.7289,1.7225,8.7102,2.659,3.967,4.6198,6.0166,0.1681,1.5913,0.1053,4.819,5.423,4.923,1.9956,3.0543,5.5333,0.1027,2.9125,0.9022,2.959,3.0045,1.0234,4.3587,3.3431,2.4993,5.0773,4.4166,3.1182,2.3573,0.0172,1.422,1.4866,7.0884,2.1316,1.8328,0.9855,4.2683,2.929,1.635,3.7705,5.0688,3.8245,3.508,6.0884,11.745,0.1445,0.1122,3.8643,0.116,0.9147,0.3669,1.1788,5.3119,3.368,3.0314,0.2209,10.5008,0.8497,3.067,0.4582,3.2955,1.287,0.5787,0.101,0.0031,0.1745,3.2396,0.5233,0.3277,0.3906,0.0007,0.6599,3.862,0.1133,7.2108,0.0061,0.1248,4.262,2.1894,1.4758,3.186,0.7649,1.3982,3.6239,0.1286,0.4612,7.4492,0.0179,1.2922,13.2347,3.9293,0.0037,2.4222,4.0783,5.7084,4.0855,3.0082,4.8627,3.7571,2.7056,6.5788,0.3369,0.4879,6.4404,6.6027,2.1451,0.8011,3.2352,0.0817,0.7617,3.4972,8.4214,0.0001,1.3957,3.1412,4.3575,3.6397,2.4723,3.2944,0.6327,0.3856,2.685,0.2108,0.1656,0.1775,0.001,0.9372,2.4993,7.9698,0.159,3.2878,6.0259,2.5125,2.6235,2.4127,0.2285,3.3046,2.6941,6.0994,1.9278,3.9416,2.7415,3.5136,7.2447,4.0537,3.008,3.8486,5.6492,2.0926,1.208,6.4648,0.0192,1.2247,2.0458,2.1622,6.6803,1.7415,0.3724,3.7263,3.1538,0.3769,0.0837,1.9044,0.0204,1.129,0.5185,4.5908,3.0669,0.0672,0.7254,2.101,0.5318,0.3722,0.0018,2.7535,3.8239,4.6493,4.083,0.1004,1.478,2.3836,0.0041,0.0526,1.0914,2.7264,1.9235,3.1355,1.1885,3.4819,1.6266,4.2994,1.4778,1.7891,0.455,1.5378,5.7584,0.992,4.0806,5.4619,0.6081,5.8379,0.539,0.3657,2.5502,6.8891,0.9019,3.43,1.4375,0.0346,0.0132,3.3186,1.267,0.0177,0.1616,6.1265,1.8759,0.9733,3.1813,5.3253,0.7028,6.1428,0.1677,2.8778,0.8399,0.003,1.8678,3.3924,5.0651,0.3574,4.0813,5.1062,4.3965,3.0073,1.7035,4.8605,2.3349,1.3135,1.389,3.8941,2.8794,0.0339,2.4414,3.6977,2.5456,8.3751,0.3088,4.0727,4.7185,2.5684,1.9053,2.4593,2.6847,0.7468,1.7729,2.7925,2.9924,5.9676,0.2638,6.6054,5.5969,1.3515,2.336,1.1609,8.4842,8.1827,4.3764,7.1509,2.0331,1.5203,1.8819,2.7589,3.5258,0.7892,10.1779,0.6538,4.7278,2.0805,0.4779,4.0054,6.5946,1.7637,0.4183,8.3152,1.925,5.5435,7.7506,1.9888,1.668,3.6066,5.4917,3.9671,1.3665,4.0361,2.2014,5.6279,4.9265,6.0735,4.8283,3.8622,5.643,3.9522,2.4527]}

This announcement runs counter to common sense ,","text":"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital by the United States runs counter to common sense. This announcement runs counter to common sense, Lavrov said after visiting Turkey s first Jewish community in the world. This recognition is contrary to the international law and the decisions of the UN Security Council resolutions. The Palestinian leadership will see that these moves are not a gesture, but a disinterest, in dialogue, he charged. These moves increase the pressure on international initiatives to end the conflict, Lavrov said. He warned that this initiative will lead to new violence, and will increase the gap between Hamas and Fatah. Jerusalem stands at the heart of the conflict with Israel in the Middle East and all decisions by the US will be remembered, including recognition of Jerusalem in the middle of the conflict. The US administration has not explained its decision. The Jerusalem announcement is another example of the American abandonment of the interests of the international community over the interests of some States, Lavrov charged. The President of the EU Donald Tusk has previously noted that the US decision on Jerusalem is regrettable. We believe that Europe s relations with Israel are very deep, and we hope that the EU will continue strengthening them, Tusk said. Jerusalem has been part of Israel s territory since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. The city has been recognized as Israel s capital since Jerusalem was established as a capital under Jordanian rule between 1967 and 1980. After the Oslo peace agreement in 1993, the West Bank was divided and the status of East Jerusalem became a key issue. Israel did not recognize the city as part of any of the agreements. Since then, Israel and Palestine, under the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, have struggled to settle the future status of the city. Some analysts say that the US decision may push Palestinians to pursue a unilateral break from the Oslo agreement and to re-enter Gaza from Gaza Strip by entering the Temple Mount which is a place of worship for the Muslims and Jews. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh praised Jerusalem a s part of Israel. There is no difference between the situation in 1967 and now, Haniyeh said. The status of Jerusalem will remain under international law under this decision, Haniyeh said. There is no doubt that Jerusalem is the holy city of three religions, he said. Jerusalem s status will be decided through negotiation among Palestinians and Israelis, he warned.","token_len":489,"entropy":[9.7722,0.7497,0.8537,0.001,1.762,1.2499,1.984,0.4792,2.0244,10.0374,0.2438,3.1982,0.2609,0.9148,12.9026,3.2223,3.4419,0.6944,1.1406,0.1675,10.1714,0.3123,0.0066,7.3412,2.1044,1.2039,7.54,6.6531,9.067,0.3157,0.0124,4.1033,0.0455,1.271,1.0431,0.3071,5.6145,3.6242,6.2776,10.4666,5.495,4.2832,3.4519,1.2559,1.3951,3.2754,0.4816,6.145,3.7203,1.9201,4.6465,0.0044,0.8974,3.2142,1.6562,1.6045,2.2034,6.4988,0.196,0.4543,2.7831,0.8852,0.0015,8.2908,1.6324,2.6932,4.9072,2.8929,3.4562,5.8593,2.7686,4.4393,5.6712,0.8755,1.5359,2.7005,5.5707,3.4422,0.4804,0.8097,8.354,5.933,2.8097,4.0942,8.5265,1.7431,4.1571,9.2368,0.2423,6.2017,1.47,7.7185,0.5582,2.0164,0.2599,6.0942,8.2649,1.2214,3.0597,0.6202,2.5351,1.6944,1.9514,0.3086,0.3313,2.5573,4.2794,0.356,2.788,4.8947,1.4561,2.8241,0.0909,5.2241,4.1097,1.9503,2.1814,3.2486,3.8631,0.6503,8.2131,0.1243,5.6403,0.1604,2.98,0.0002,1.0663,7.5834,6.2741,3.1585,0.1592,1.2776,0.0023,0.5245,0.842,4.2496,1.5887,4.4864,0.8158,2.9316,0.0004,1.9385,6.6526,8.563,2.0235,0.3303,3.5229,4.2216,0.7072,8.6004,2.1839,5.1302,7.3041,0.6222,0.5417,4.2944,0.7241,6.8831,0.1258,0.4289,0.46,0.4854,1.9859,2.3299,4.2496,1.7938,3.2802,6.3811,2.1644,1.5834,2.4969,1.9752,5.1792,4.1266,1.9485,4.2502,2.5022,0.1245,0.8789,4.1088,7.0635,0.0264,1.2362,5.9691,0.0411,0.6227,3.1227,0.0088,4.6166,0.5738,4.025,0.0028,7.8749,7.5683,1.8721,1.3795,5.8097,0.0728,1.7777,5.4856,1.7196,0.4309,5.5641,7.1056,0.0037,0.0001,2.7954,5.5784,5.6671,0.4845,1.1157,1.7385,3.6171,3.2599,0.8033,1.1637,6.9344,0.0113,1.3005,5.9814,4.1201,0.55,6.4206,7.3931,5.2266,0.1901,1.0891,1.2749,3.6923,6.7877,1.5707,0.8053,1.6818,3.0754,0.2743,0.9891,3.0679,0.8883,2.5035,7.4499,3.2229,1.9985,4.2703,0.0012,0.406,0.5461,4.9963,2.9731,1.123,3.8204,0.0045,2.0568,0.9586,2.6609,1.1554,1.0149,2.0229,0.015,0.5605,2.42,0.0208,0.1262,0.8839,0.4202,0.5574,1.5858,5.5993,1.9474,0.6991,3.5592,1.0446,1.2045,0.2831,0.0808,1.6092,6.4431,0.4014,1.1253,2.5605,0.6458,2.7936,4.9264,4.8971,1.1994,4.7902,1.7085,0.0425,4.2803,0.2471,5.1495,0.9623,3.1625,3.3033,2.8708,1.8109,1.4212,0.1741,1.0929,5.44,0.4271,1.7456,1.2824,3.433,1.6829,4.4381,0.2328,4.4342,0.0036,2.6632,1.5258,5.4464,0.6671,1.3405,2.7626,5.4507,0.0477,0.6938,1.4231,1.2565,1.5579,3.6445,0.0013,5.5789,1.9278,0.6337,6.164,1.603,4.0584,1.3429,0.2176,2.0845,3.8136,3.2811,3.4647,3.7361,0.8056,3.046,0.0211,2.466,0.8886,0.0165,4.305,0.4501,0.2775,0.0221,0.2911,0.1526,7.1245,0.6202,4.0859,1.0469,5.5042,3.2427,0.1637,1.2166,0.5667,0.6676,5.4338,5.1096,2.5924,0.4289,1.115,2.786,1.0038,3.9813,6.1178,3.3863,0.5211,6.0335,1.2803,3.8036,6.4206,3.2079,0.493,0.948,1.3516,2.0647,2.1624,4.7531,0.7318,2.0119,5.6785,4.8124,2.4005,4.2631,4.9008,6.6176,1.2396,6.0799,0.0024,6.8406,1.3587,2.707,4.9964,0.9217,1.6848,1.6734,1.1976,4.3862,2.4319,1.8286,0.6354,6.5745,4.9386,0.4921,0.0004,0.0289,0.0003,0.0153,0.0079,6.6119,5.2999,6.9078,7.6888,5.4853,0.0423,1.1635,2.3565,6.1442,1.0937,0.9343,4.9315,0.2903,1.0161,5.7239,0.6088,6.7282,0.3207,1.401,1.0692,1.2634,0.0032,0.0008,0.0004,0.2283,0.4281,2.0111,5.443,0.1066,0.3572,3.3054,2.4411,3.6759,2.7148,0.3936,5.2077,5.484,2.9792,1.0511,0.9065,0.0024,0.0003,0.0003,0.4816,0.1891,4.4563,0.7921,0.4324,4.436,0.2394,3.8847,1.3188,2.8925,3.326,0.8668,0.1643,9.9146,2.6079,0.9583,3.9887,0.6652,0.1696,3.724,4.1422,1.402,1.8669,1.0678,3.017,3.674,3.6871,4.2675,4.945,1.1403,1.4272,1.0015,0.9237,4.4522,0.095]}

A coalition of conservative, centrist, and liberal members of the alliance met at a summit in Brussels for an extra-day meeting at which Stoltenberg\u2019s tenure will be discussed. \u201c NATO has always been about fighting a common enemy,\u201d the group, known for its tough rhetoric against Russia, said at a briefing after the meeting as they signed a declaration reaffirming adherence to the alliance\u2019s foundational document. Stoltenberg will keep his seat for a second term. \u201c He is the right person to be in that position and I would not dare to imagine anyone better to continue NATO s journey through the crisis we are facing; it s a difficult journey,\u201d a Western ally said. Stoltenberg was appointed to that position in 2017, only a month after he left the prime minister s post, becoming an adviser for NATO. The election of the new leaders came hours before US President Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin met in Helsinki. Trump, in a post-mid-term address to Congress, suggested that Russia may be behind the hacking of the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden s email account but said he would not hold the Kremlin accountable. \u201cWe won\u2019t be subject to any of this Russian witch hunts,\u201d Trump said. This article was written by Lillian Wong and published by WND, a nonprofit news organization that covers the stories that are left out of the mainstream press.\nThe first thing i would like to do is say thank you. I know that you are not a stranger to this site and that you keep coming to it every day, so this is nothing less than a thank you to you.\nI\u2019m thankful that you came across our website and that you have decided to find out some facts about me. And I\u2019m especially thankful for you because i know that there are many people out there who simply cannot understand, accept or even take care of a man with cystinosis. Maybe because they don\u2019t know why people have cystinosis; maybe they do, but they don\u2019t understand the disease and its treatment well enough to understand who and why we ask for help.","token_len":491,"entropy":[6.2349,7.1981,11.1037,10.1542,6.4174,0.3276,0.0066,0.0035,0.0005,10.605,8.1915,2.7018,4.7489,1.3898,0.0082,1.7591,0.5524,6.5816,3.0933,0.1179,4.0393,4.2493,7.4409,6.21,4.0285,1.2375,5.0061,1.6233,4.3799,5.02,1.3699,0.002,1.5994,4.8736,7.3297,0.1116,0.8646,1.747,3.1615,1.0374,5.5901,1.0808,0.5114,5.4726,5.2823,0.7042,5.8477,2.902,3.1977,2.5503,0.8047,2.0595,4.3228,0.3188,0.6237,2.9556,6.1603,2.9593,2.3069,2.1319,0.5034,2.3266,2.4647,3.2238,6.1007,1.9625,7.6266,2.2693,4.6722,1.7562,2.2008,0.0043,0.0004,0.0013,15.1804,8.5094,1.131,4.5118,1.9594,0.7259,5.4224,0.3184,6.9616,3.9598,6.659,2.8276,5.0547,1.4216,5.0781,4.6515,4.242,3.0397,0.1765,1.0119,9.7626,6.3579,3.973,4.0637,4.2808,4.705,1.4083,0.4152,4.688,3.899,2.6766,1.4236,0.4072,2.7025,3.8658,0.8693,3.9867,5.1698,0.5994,0.6363,7.1118,5.674,5.6779,0.8369,4.4359,5.1336,0.0038,8.8228,0.029,0.728,2.0076,9.5771,1.4615,0.1211,8.2195,7.6304,0.9777,4.0596,0.0111,0.0006,0.0011,3.3149,6.4712,0.9045,2.8954,2.7655,2.1404,1.8439,0.1005,2.3532,3.7117,0.2645,4.1878,2.177,2.0729,6.9048,3.4614,0.747,2.8447,2.6557,2.5332,0.5152,3.1032,3.5798,3.4086,3.2131,7.5762,0.8923,4.5533,3.9879,6.6077,4.0276,5.3215,6.6958,8.3491,7.1984,3.766,1.1668,6.1127,5.6155,0.9635,1.6431,7.9413,3.0177,8.4051,1.9886,4.2093,3.1326,2.0525,1.3957,1.5876,3.4205,6.6278,4.5155,3.5991,0.4927,3.4046,0.0195,0.0014,0.0011,2.7231,2.4445,1.9741,4.9475,1.4947,1.0255,6.7463,1.54,5.3216,2.3768,1.5036,0.3347,2.3549,2.4922,1.1953,4.377,0.1314,8.6344,0.7064,2.4924,7.749,4.2946,2.78,3.3085,2.0011,2.1323,2.2986,6.4833,0.5073,2.4268,1.0102,6.4187,3.2705,5.733,1.7558,7.4053,0.7127,0.1834,0.0276,3.2806,2.289,3.28,0.0496,0.0017,1.1559,0.7395,6.1745,1.4668,3.113,2.7459,2.711,1.1775,4.9786,0.199,8.3787,1.4966,3.0854,2.6413,1.3048,3.2035,0.3933,4.6478,0.9589,1.6057,3.2416,1.79,1.9359,0.3528,0.705,0.516,1.1449,0.5029,6.0557,2.0607,12.1682,0.1473,7.658,1.1762,0.9716,5.3967,2.5527,1.3856,1.5683,1.4702,5.1928,3.5488,3.8736,0.9383,0.7958,4.4826,0.1463,11.0368,6.5522,3.8468,1.9565,1.4321,1.7384,7.1327,0.1564,2.2068,3.794,1.431,4.4065,7.5149,2.2614,1.4766,0.248,0.7108,1.9708,0.591,0.9713,5.5078,5.5224,0.9923,1.6511,0.1207,5.9433,6.0608,8.0367,1.9858,3.6548,0.988,4.6747,2.1092,2.9862,1.0583,1.855,0.4974,0.7668,2.818,3.2566,3.5173,8.426,2.9628,4.9608,6.9452,0.9499,0.3303,1.3254,0.7398,3.5577,0.2894,1.8017,11.0012,4.9688,4.0136,7.7344,4.1397,0.6071,0.0858,2.8376,0.6377,3.4901,2.0801,0.0317,2.8368,2.0875,3.7474,1.7886,1.6024,1.2044,3.7117,3.0435,3.6886,0.1243,2.2439,6.5541,1.677,2.1844,1.2918,6.6304,3.0739,3.6094,1.4376,3.6795,0.2536,2.0714,3.2372,3.456,0.9183,6.8058,2.828,0.0671,0.7547,2.4515,0.0512,2.1197,1.2032,0.8315,2.7029,2.0841,9.5225,2.8914,1.2558,3.6933,1.6435,0.8117,3.9978,5.1986,4.0241,2.3486,1.274,1.712,0.711,2.1506,4.6764,0.0712,6.6441,2.3066,5.3103,4.0665,0.5421,3.3504,1.4004,4.6387,1.2421,2.3526,0.2945,0.3355,4.6825,0.7085,1.9319,2.6124,3.8583,3.6503,3.3171,0.6724,3.6529,0.8895,1.1545,1.5273,1.7292,0.0158,0.4814,6.3493,2.5735,1.9635,4.2414,8.0394,1.3459,2.9303,4.975,3.8291,0.0221,3.9576,4.3049,3.8537,8.891,4.7698,5.4255,0.8139,1.2802,6.7591,4.0875,2.9565,1.9331,0.5956,1.1245,0.0481,1.307,4.8684,5.0412,2.9942,2.4578,0.8757,0.0825,0.0772,5.5115,0.44,2.293,2.8145,3.31,1.049,1.5899,1.1204,0.2363,0.0395,0.0361,1.6064,2.1186,3.6237,2.2776,3.059,2.8406,6.6842,0.2602,0.5198,2.7025,5.8193,3.6608,2.6353,3.7659,7.9012,0.8283,1.3611,1.1567]}

Beijing, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Tuesday he and the Chinese would explore any opportunity to restart discussions.\n\u201cWe are speaking in order to get acquainted with how the U.S. view their military policy, and we see it as a continuation of what was previously stated,\u201d he told reporters, after meeting with Wang Yi, vice-minister of foreign affairs and an envoy from President Xi Jinping.\n\u201cWe understand that Washington still sees the two Koreas\u2019 reunification, which happened in 1953, as a \u2018red line\u2019 that is out of the question,\u201d the Defense Ministry said in a statement Tuesday.","token_len":491,"entropy":[8.2779,9.7655,10.9144,0.7053,0.8727,0.5699,0.6585,4.318,2.3746,9.3702,1.7713,3.409,0.0016,2.1672,0.0292,2.7977,1.0474,2.1532,5.0131,0.0919,7.1298,2.6186,4.2915,3.7116,1.4791,4.7633,1.82,1.0755,2.9396,1.9396,0.3241,0.72,3.0189,2.3292,3.4853,0.5796,1.4932,1.4809,4.9985,6.5781,0.6782,7.2049,1.8156,0.7475,0.1877,17.7119,4.2157,4.2586,4.2697,0.1572,1.4941,1.4188,0.3961,1.9964,1.7033,0.0206,3.0911,8.6957,3.4078,3.7482,2.9271,2.6466,0.0035,5.2147,2.5078,7.6084,1.2881,3.7244,3.6649,3.3955,4.9233,1.5622,2.2183,0.7979,1.7843,3.7155,3.6026,1.8956,5.0198,6.2126,3.2382,1.4205,0.0132,0.1784,8.0559,11.9334,1.382,1.899,0.1639,0.5137,0.4043,2.6672,0.1166,16.0631,8.2022,4.2072,3.457,0.588,4.2572,5.8122,0.1116,4.8495,5.5761,0.4228,0.1361,6.0255,1.8145,15.988,4.3474,5.9828,0.1812,0.0893,1.6162,0.285,5.483,0.697,5.4417,4.0897,1.4526,5.1859,0.0842,0.0965,2.2588,5.3676,1.1776,6.6071,0.1537,0.1889,5.3989,0.7496,1.2151,4.812,7.1219,0.9769,2.8994,3.2527,7.074,4.8973,3.0099,8.0947,5.8496,4.5023,4.667,0.9244,1.8928,2.8094,0.0016,0.431,0.8689,4.2339,0.9856,1.6386,1.8632,3.9007,2.3,0.5618,0.0146,5.9161,0.9934,4.1769,0.8826,0.6983,2.8936,0.6341,1.4283,1.5571,0.0005,0.0071,0.0918,5.4378,0.207,6.0766,0.1815,5.9271,1.4205,2.9255,0.007,0.0919,6.027,3.3649,0.7402,6.0427,0.1034,0.3581,6.8744,1.5449,7.0598,3.6475,3.3187,4.3771,1.2058,0.5794,2.6463,0.6435,0.174,0.3585,1.9791,2.1777,0.0007,0.0773,0.1798,3.2854,1.4413,5.1271,3.4152,7.4672,6.8656,2.9524,5.5075,0.1478,4.0265,0.0063,5.8367,5.0646,7.1728,2.0142,6.3618,2.9001,5.5218,6.2024,1.0065,1.6305,1.0031,4.1102,9.1928,0.7879,7.7026,5.5351,0.0001,0.0124,0.3223,5.635,2.0877,4.9564,6.439,4.9337,7.6125,2.5685,0.0006,0.1064,0.5888,2.2168,0.8413,2.6038,4.7369,0.3931,0.4105,4.2479,0.105,4.9228,2.8328,3.6725,0.7467,2.9282,1.5978,1.7128,0.7615,2.0199,4.2737,0.0037,5.3595,3.5193,0.9885,2.6485,1.8703,3.4263,2.3099,0.3293,4.3635,2.3127,2.048,1.7271,2.5684,0.0301,6.7755,1.3657,3.9322,4.2294,1.0426,0.4247,4.6891,4.9524,3.3819,0.7814,7.1074,5.2751,5.8438,0.7337,0.4605,0.8348,1.2006,6.5095,2.9683,5.0538,3.1668,0.1218,2.9737,0.9374,4.9698,0.6895,8.0222,0.738,2.9914,0.8788,2.0726,8.3965,0.5557,3.1066,2.0029,6.5509,3.1111,4.605,6.1781,2.6098,0.6292,3.5399,2.427,2.9209,0.2841,0.0728,0.0612,0.3118,2.7609,1.3726,4.9057,0.329,2.5194,0.1075,1.6848,4.5595,4.7384,0.1075,2.1788,1.9167,4.5408,1.9287,2.8911,3.5949,1.9327,0.5684,1.1578,0.0006,0.0148,0.1391,8.6453,1.3924,0.8784,1.9918,3.1474,0.0534,2.1486,0.8018,0.2714,6.1394,2.143,2.5044,0.9107,7.2973,3.6704,0.1808,0.2672,0.0012,0.0,0.0001,0.4999,4.4174,3.4592,4.2395,1.9766,2.7323,3.8729,5.9278,3.9564,5.5519,0.5227,4.9837,4.6794,2.6935,0.3815,2.9795,1.2856,7.4419,1.7195,7.156,3.5542,4.4106,0.0788,4.0057,7.7125,0.3658,5.4799,1.6637,2.3306,0.0009,0.0133,0.2214,4.8415,4.9964,4.2757,3.8967,1.4996,1.2035,1.7496,5.1181,3.0204,0.364,1.1668,5.1533,0.066,2.8432,2.6474,4.2963,4.66,2.0027,1.8377,2.3786,1.9817,2.1286,0.3522,3.1138,4.6338,3.1387,0.4113,7.7187,0.3645,0.5177,5.0685,2.0145,5.1107,0.0041,0.2209,2.2771,0.1158,1.2174,5.4963,2.522,1.8996,7.1829,0.8023,0.0943,2.7152,0.2661,1.314,0.3558,1.1456,4.6964,0.4374,5.8144,5.0386,2.9333,1.3763,4.643,1.2372,0.0004,8.6913,0.9057,16.2899,1.8929,3.7959,3.2309,5.4814,1.0044,3.435,0.6581,0.1063,0.8788,8.5676,0.2541,6.1252,3.7111,1.6098,0.2341,2.7688,3.3523,6.5087,0.1781,2.3206,0.8907,1.3617,0.4036,0.6537,3.0364,4.7862,0.0822,0.5676,1.7322,0.1213,0.1216,3.8445,0.2262]}
{"prompt":"The question of whether U.S. Representative John Conyers may resign in the face of sexual harassment allegations will be addressed in the \u201c next day or so , \u201d an attorney for the congressman said","text":"The question of whether U.S. Representative John Conyers may resign in the face of sexual harassment allegations will be addressed in the \u201c next day or so, \u201d an attorney for the congressman said Thursday. Conyers\u2019 office told NBC New York the attorney \u201cwasn\u2019t allowed to comment\u201d Wednesday. An ethics committee of the House Judiciary Committee will consider Conyers\u2019 resignation on Dec. 17. If Conyers\u2019 resignation is approved, his successor will have to file with the Senate for confirmation. Sen. John Thune, the South Dakota Republican who is the chairman of the committee, is said to be planning to take no action. The Washington Post\u2019s Jake Tapper earlier cited a source who said the committee has a \u201cbacklog of ethics violations\u201d that will delay a move to appoint a new chair at least into early 2021 and that members are working to push the new year. But even if Thune does not move to appoint a new committee chair, Conyers\u2019 office has warned the ethics committee it was ready to resign. A Senate staff note Thursday said a vote by the committee on the ethics allegations against Conyers would likely only take a few minutes or more. \u201cI know from other committees over the years that this is as simple as it can be, without making major waves,\u201d said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an odd contradiction here. On one hand Republicans have said if Conyers\u2019 resignation is approved the next nominee would have to go through a confirmation vote in the Senate. But on Tuesday the Republican leadership released a statement saying that no vote would be needed on Conyers if he resigns. The statement read, \u201cIn light of the recent sexual misconduct allegations and the Congressman\u2019s subsequent resignation, we believe an ethics vote will move this process along more rapidly.\u201d\nIn January 2011, three different women alleged wrongdoing by Conyers. The women said Conyers touched them inappropriately during meetings and in the hallways of their offices, and one of them told an investigator that he asked her to drink his own urine. The woman, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, said Conyers didn\u2019t ask what she did to it after refusing. But the woman and others claimed Conyers pushed him, kissing and fondling women without their consent.","token_len":492,"entropy":[7.1634,1.6826,1.4048,6.6854,0.2123,0.0116,0.099,9.1004,2.8433,1.4869,0.0,5.4175,4.3083,3.4357,0.7476,3.8359,0.0009,4.9414,0.9146,0.3926,4.2936,1.0246,3.0999,1.2793,1.2997,16.1538,7.2903,9.3771,5.601,0.877,0.7123,1.4818,9.8909,6.0705,6.8785,5.1588,1.0166,0.9769,1.7823,1.3333,2.4924,0.3348,4.1293,0.0014,9.9899,5.6032,5.747,4.5439,3.0251,6.1034,0.028,3.6997,5.2486,5.4429,2.2815,8.91,4.0336,2.3883,6.8136,1.4828,5.6667,0.1069,1.939,8.4641,2.8099,7.1161,0.8874,6.4828,6.4562,1.6597,4.8612,0.5309,0.4009,2.4836,0.064,2.3095,2.6662,2.1021,0.0135,2.1917,0.086,1.5835,2.1394,3.6902,0.0011,3.3031,0.4031,4.8433,0.7943,0.0078,2.218,0.0219,1.3962,0.6839,1.8797,0.284,3.2503,4.5087,1.6343,3.1183,0.8754,4.9018,4.0812,0.2321,2.7844,3.0805,2.0075,0.6456,6.3701,0.0432,3.5544,1.9855,0.0001,1.2069,2.6804,2.7166,0.0249,0.4886,0.6137,1.6934,2.5695,2.7346,0.0286,0.0476,2.3947,0.2004,3.6089,5.2032,0.0164,0.442,4.298,0.4108,3.6547,6.5106,0.443,1.5607,2.8486,4.3125,0.1844,3.237,4.8081,4.4186,6.1008,0.7536,0.0013,7.298,6.5545,1.2941,1.789,2.2283,0.8144,1.9084,3.0038,2.8254,3.2348,8.6195,0.8351,9.5396,4.697,0.9909,5.8548,1.1877,1.8112,2.3861,3.2131,3.4809,7.3414,3.1791,5.0525,0.8226,3.0205,1.4147,1.8655,3.6511,5.1061,3.3839,6.8801,5.7567,7.1038,4.9287,3.7404,5.0446,2.4896,4.6183,1.195,5.9377,2.7518,4.6993,6.2542,3.5332,4.4629,4.626,0.8131,6.0383,0.0069,2.7287,1.7574,3.6161,1.4914,0.6312,0.6243,0.3462,3.9517,1.5576,0.5206,4.909,0.0101,1.2823,0.0232,1.1455,2.2531,5.237,2.669,4.5804,0.5224,2.936,5.3566,4.4326,0.269,5.5323,1.972,3.7255,4.0449,5.0786,7.3049,4.3879,1.1849,3.7013,3.949,4.5269,0.5056,1.492,2.1769,2.2714,3.4516,5.7955,3.9192,0.1609,0.0037,1.9508,3.3531,6.2996,1.3857,2.6022,0.922,4.2784,4.1815,3.9611,0.4421,4.6636,1.4679,8.6465,4.8926,3.7342,5.9499,4.8233,6.3114,0.1084,0.6679,0.7196,3.9423,0.967,7.421,3.9807,0.1969,2.0363,2.1665,0.1992,2.5013,6.3011,5.3569,5.5301,7.0483,2.0225,3.9196,2.1314,3.2246,3.8484,0.0036,4.0293,0.0003,0.0001,0.0001,0.2478,1.0431,0.004,0.0135,1.1093,3.9724,2.1611,4.2511,11.672,6.1917,2.1033,0.263,3.2246,5.8929,6.4159,2.0516,0.5968,4.2302,4.0062,0.1986,8.0104,1.9163,3.6207,5.4816,0.7801,0.0196,1.3178,0.0561,1.429,0.6707,0.259,3.6478,2.4862,11.1432,1.4443,1.8369,0.1095,3.3372,0.6486,1.3082,4.5479,2.1058,2.7355,0.52,0.3655,0.8755,2.1615,2.3254,7.4346,2.6321,3.2255,1.9688,5.3875,0.3676,0.5609,0.7016,2.3161,3.9321,2.9717,1.5168,1.1406,2.0322,2.7861,1.2276,0.0305,5.5046,2.0803,2.8738,0.1517,0.4687,2.4634,1.1525,4.5196,1.5957,4.4542,2.4372,4.0635,2.2557,0.0009,0.8687,2.2413,3.1763,1.604,0.1513,3.5039,1.0887,7.8042,2.3926,1.2361,0.5877,6.1404,2.6257,0.4792,2.4715,2.4996,5.9177,4.0943,2.6928,2.8416,5.9846,2.3411,3.7737,2.1203,5.2118,4.5236,1.3256,1.0641,1.6224,1.672,3.7241,5.2003,4.566,0.4132,5.1678,5.5724,2.2512,2.6956,10.1632,1.2779,0.7415,0.03,2.3002,1.9529,3.079,2.8466,1.1164,0.0162,6.5297,0.305,0.1272,2.6749,4.3611,1.4554,3.668,2.5521,6.413,0.6999,0.4848,1.5757,3.1534,1.9256,1.9076,4.0397,0.8646,0.8258,2.7778,4.1126,2.094,0.7511,1.2621,3.8335,0.3403,0.6886,6.421,2.191,3.338,0.1418,0.953,1.4307,3.1139,2.5403,1.132,3.563,0.6809,0.0015,0.0217,0.6254,3.1367,0.3588,0.0714,1.2527,0.3308,1.3721,0.7705,0.0135,6.4056,1.3348,1.3286,0.1915,3.8659,4.8114,0.485,1.8574,2.0436,5.9934,4.3545,8.1827,2.1814,3.7253,1.7061,2.4918,4.4414,3.1601,4.3799,1.5233,0.1098,5.0398,5.5346,3.4274,7.3909,0.7973,2.4203,0.0015,5.8232,2.9162,1.0462,0.143,0.9426]}

Trump is a strong supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nIn his tweets, the president also said Sessions is a \u201cvery dangerous\u201d person and said that if people like Sessions don\u2019t leave office, they will \u201chave to go.\u201d\n\u201cSo far, there\u2019s been no indication he has taken these words to heart, but I expect he will,\u201d said Chris Hedges, author of The War on Truth.\nTrump\u2019s campaign has long said Sessions was an ally in the 2016 Republican presidential campaign and was instrumental in developing the Trump campaign\u2019s foreign policy proposals. But the president has not made any known public statements about Sessions.\nTrump has said Sessions was \u201ca friend of Hillary Clinton,\u201d and during the campaign attacked Sessions on his sexual orientation, and his appearance as a Democrat in the 2014 special counsel investigating alleged Russian corruption and election meddling at the U.S. Department of Justice.\nDuring a campaign debate in March, Trump, who has claimed that his relationship with Russia, while not necessarily malign, was not that great, said Sessions was a \u201cdistraction\u201d from other issues, including the economy.\nPrevious : Trump calls Sessions\u2019 firing \u2018a mistake that has been made\u2019 \u2013 CNN","token_len":492,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,11.2122,4.27,3.0194,1.7951,1.812,4.7591,0.0019,2.3065,7.2233,0.1291,1.1771,0.0924,0.0002,0.3859,2.9275,1.5974,2.4373,7.6549,3.3456,3.086,3.0698,0.5576,7.4613,3.8335,0.0075,1.3137,8.3596,0.29,4.0092,2.0876,6.8433,5.7385,0.7709,4.4908,2.9317,0.2837,0.6195,0.1302,21.5513,4.3702,1.0913,0.8294,3.8942,6.7347,0.9372,5.6108,0.9588,0.1737,18.291,7.1338,13.7956,4.4474,6.2554,3.8984,2.5018,6.7343,3.1211,6.3516,0.5118,3.3774,5.4914,8.0689,1.1953,2.0779,1.8595,2.0903,1.2593,0.8833,0.0376,0.6351,0.2018,4.6603,6.0291,5.7935,3.1789,3.1163,1.931,0.5901,0.7208,4.4227,4.8524,4.6183,4.935,4.6663,0.4426,2.757,0.4336,1.3802,5.042,2.4581,4.4413,3.2007,1.8104,2.0841,2.7955,1.5324,10.4188,0.0033,4.1209,1.4157,3.5609,2.6877,1.9668,0.0472,4.7936,1.4921,1.8934,4.8198,1.7771,3.9594,5.5434,3.9637,1.0999,6.1789,3.4779,4.4481,0.1298,0.0009,0.5914,2.1447,3.0741,2.0237,7.2616,1.2199,0.1944,2.3568,3.3658,1.4898,2.9033,0.6852,1.5298,4.2145,1.226,0.3995,6.0561,2.3166,2.122,3.9316,0.573,0.121,3.6769,3.1889,10.8448,2.1994,6.6213,0.2439,0.0102,0.9714,1.1729,2.1826,1.7736,3.6721,4.5035,2.3783,5.7459,0.007,1.8059,0.3581,5.3489,4.6284,3.2265,1.4463,1.0008,4.2291,0.1,1.0527,4.8098,0.4321,2.9296,3.1663,6.5649,1.9884,1.8924,1.2006,1.1479,0.2841,3.6098,1.3893,3.9298,5.491,4.0096,2.6176,1.7397,0.8453,1.158,0.9293,0.5145,0.5296,1.9591,0.0044,6.421,0.1526,4.8743,1.5951,2.8323,1.7693,3.358,5.0306,0.3216,4.142,1.7023,0.1447,2.5573,5.7894,6.9744,0.8852,0.0357,4.1043,2.6527,6.7992,1.2995,5.0301,0.1599,4.2293,2.6483,0.8676,0.0173,0.0071,1.0498,3.04,4.5298,4.2534,3.5301,0.6045,0.0163,1.984,0.1685,0.0433,0.0043,1.7735,0.5763,3.5493,2.1138,1.9898,0.378,3.246,0.7579,1.7796,2.5989,1.9913,2.4236,1.576,9.8185,0.3164,4.6603,3.4979,2.0555,0.2409,2.1743,2.2021,3.5346,2.1044,2.8441,6.0481,3.859,1.4752,2.9919,0.6791,2.5986,0.1995,5.4372,4.0515,0.636,2.2138,0.831,6.0787,0.394,1.5805,0.9142,2.4842,1.6769,3.8992,0.6624,0.3688,2.501,0.4908,4.7501,4.0327,0.4143,2.9961,1.2979,1.2674,0.1128,1.8984,0.3715,2.7888,4.1814,2.8771,4.2375,5.491,4.8187,3.2378,1.1987,2.0749,1.7168,3.6233,5.8486,1.5893,0.9429,3.2139,0.8833,0.5004,2.9469,6.3738,5.1048,0.001,0.3721,6.0679,0.0407,2.1305,4.8531,0.3072,5.4868,0.9456,0.8279,2.8593,2.4791,0.1177,0.0576,4.7784,1.6665,5.1742,3.0418,2.3221,2.3203,3.3827,3.8617,3.8324,0.6655,4.6241,4.5755,1.2697,2.4574,1.7925,2.7603,4.2073,0.0497,5.1045,1.0891,2.9645,1.2088,6.3366,0.2679,0.0167,1.8444,0.0206,5.2282,0.377,3.2921,2.0572,1.5539,1.4893,3.3251,3.2597,0.9509,6.8673,2.7282,0.9851,0.6522,1.88,1.7726,0.3885,2.6818,1.8034,2.4041,1.973,1.7164,8.583,0.426,3.1724,3.5032,2.1432,3.3738,0.05,2.6634,0.7639,0.5414,0.9221,5.3717,0.7872,0.5977,8.1405,3.2671,2.7812,1.8165,5.9805,3.11,2.3873,3.486,3.4412,6.2846,4.6499,0.3858,5.6166,1.9137,0.9412,7.0159,5.3353,1.8389,5.4821,4.3499,0.6672,6.5741,3.3999,4.1044,1.043,5.4325,0.1888,3.1794,0.0005,0.003,0.0271,0.8546,0.0005,0.0591,0.2209,0.4174,4.6268,2.2344,2.1866,5.8048,0.8903,3.1516,0.2519,0.326,5.7425,1.0271,1.3608,5.9673,1.6547,2.9783,4.8079,0.0291,2.2452,5.6114,4.3905,1.819,4.586,11.3045,2.1542,0.2019,1.2998,2.5912,5.0764,4.6185,1.2583,2.4327,2.4878,0.9462,1.0278,7.5643,0.209,8.3967,1.3118,0.7558,0.1418,2.2811,5.5986,1.9119,2.3339,1.5387,1.9518,4.0923,0.8353,0.4288,9.2483,8.5173,2.2495,5.0013,0.7206,8.0651,2.9186,11.2315,4.6436,7.0616,3.011,2.9599,4.9997,3.5635,2.363,1.7983,2.1614,1.8527,5.5638,4.572]}
{"prompt":"House Republicans are proposing to eliminate the $ 7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles , which could hurt automakers like General Motors Co , Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co , according to the bill","text":"House Republicans are proposing to eliminate the $ 7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, which could hurt automakers like General Motors Co, Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co, according to the bill currently scheduled for a House floor vote this fall.\nThe proposal is the latest effort by Washington lawmakers to lower the cost of electric vehicles. The proposal is also expected to reduce auto purchases in general, which Congress has been working on all year.\nHouse Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., On Wednesday said in conference that as an alternative to removing the subsidy, an option would be that buyers would bear the tax credit cost. He said the House could discuss legislation to reduce the cost of electric vehicles in an effort to increase sales.\nIf the cost of the program is raised to $ 3,500, manufacturers would have to pass it along to consumers in the form of higher vehicle prices, according to estimates by the American Council on Education based on the lawmakers\u2019 proposal. And some lawmakers who support electric vehicle incentives worry that a subsidy can encourage automakers to focus on battery development rather than improving the vehicles.\n\u201cIf you see the subsidies as a means of encouraging innovation, or the incentives as a tool to put pressure on automakers to develop fuel-efficient vehicles, they can work against each other, \u201dsaid a Democrat who was at the meeting. \u201cWhat happens if we can\u2019t make money on a new battery?\u201d\nThe cost of the $ 7,500 tax credit for an electric vehicle has been a subject of intense debate between Congress and the administration. The House plans to remove the credit next week, after the White House proposed in a letter to lawmakers that such a tax credit be reduced to $ 3,500. \u201c The administration believes the tax credit should be revised to a simple flat rate of $ 3,500, but the White House is not proposing to do so, \u201dsaid a statement from the White House. \u201cThe administration will continue to support efforts to help consumers choose EVs and to keep auto manufacturers afloat. \u201d\nIn the current proposal, the House\u2019s bill to remove the electric vehicle benefit would not include any alternative measure to reduce the tax credit cost.\nAt the same time, legislation that the administration proposed in December to increase the refundable tax credit to $ 15,000 has been delayed, but the White House is currently working on such a measure.","token_len":492,"entropy":[9.0903,2.3155,4.4832,1.2234,3.8552,1.2077,3.8041,13.8439,2.6831,1.3879,2.5441,0.9172,0.8782,6.8125,0.8882,1.5612,1.9539,3.2846,5.1038,4.2906,2.5433,2.5985,0.0077,4.5959,3.3846,2.7743,2.0251,0.6731,1.9968,0.5249,0.0615,1.7104,2.3037,0.0014,2.1394,5.5226,7.5537,5.3568,1.1593,1.3943,1.5179,1.4428,0.0841,2.7364,4.7567,0.0344,0.3585,14.6673,3.8267,2.6195,2.847,0.659,2.9957,0.5871,5.4982,1.9036,0.1212,5.3754,0.7773,3.5277,0.0539,0.7665,0.498,1.9849,1.8363,4.692,2.5882,3.0099,2.7513,0.0202,4.2847,5.2601,4.727,2.1134,6.0276,1.2586,2.1663,7.4615,1.3483,1.8762,3.8034,1.0139,7.3973,0.7617,0.7927,0.3253,9.5446,5.0449,0.0493,0.0337,1.4199,1.4987,0.0153,0.0001,1.6326,0.135,0.0027,0.0071,0.0128,11.4082,3.707,3.0276,4.3625,8.5312,1.9203,6.2347,4.0105,3.0212,0.1479,7.0,0.1508,5.605,0.3057,5.9363,4.3307,1.7295,0.2859,7.2817,7.0182,1.9957,7.3903,0.3003,3.3301,1.6074,3.9782,1.4801,2.7823,1.0932,1.461,3.5154,3.1636,7.3637,5.965,1.6967,3.0719,0.3763,2.8683,0.2814,1.0171,0.3088,2.0195,4.2234,2.1641,0.0361,3.9651,2.719,0.8198,0.1787,5.5258,1.0036,5.8498,0.5356,1.7056,5.1425,1.0438,4.0236,1.3767,0.6023,6.1827,0.7951,0.9504,1.0729,4.836,0.8609,1.9896,0.2837,6.7111,5.3089,1.8005,0.1605,1.2806,3.5534,2.2034,0.1153,0.0031,4.5558,4.7355,2.3339,1.5252,2.1475,0.0013,5.407,0.9855,1.2204,2.6392,4.1425,0.528,2.681,11.0246,0.0322,2.1594,10.5686,17.0862,8.0726,7.5318,0.1979,5.9608,4.5423,3.2196,3.6296,1.7438,5.1065,1.543,3.7761,5.1823,0.5108,3.4899,5.1878,5.041,3.7212,1.7311,0.1495,5.2896,0.3677,6.7059,4.7152,2.0429,0.0036,4.5765,1.664,3.0085,1.4217,0.1939,5.3575,5.4147,6.7899,4.0807,4.6235,3.1263,4.9905,3.0859,0.9966,3.9853,1.6508,3.8012,4.9266,0.6227,3.9837,4.2961,4.6003,0.7797,0.4063,3.6189,0.5172,6.1712,2.8006,0.0126,1.2436,0.5435,2.8996,7.0944,1.1301,0.0908,0.4517,0.2406,4.4953,3.3046,4.0575,2.8082,5.7797,0.0043,2.1642,10.1708,5.0862,2.0603,4.8691,6.1097,1.3152,3.6626,4.1893,0.2143,1.9097,0.608,5.4365,0.5046,5.4763,4.017,0.7958,2.4466,3.8557,13.9456,2.9325,2.0613,3.3023,5.0135,2.3744,3.0798,4.7481,3.5634,1.8604,2.9319,3.6305,0.7264,2.0163,4.5038,0.2327,1.2209,4.0402,0.893,0.0061,0.0245,1.434,0.0084,1.7441,4.7878,0.082,0.1978,3.569,1.0559,2.7902,3.5003,0.0329,2.2604,0.1762,5.2173,4.2292,0.1214,1.4919,3.4079,1.0907,1.6552,2.9685,5.7974,0.0479,5.2563,0.3259,1.7252,3.7615,1.5336,0.9133,3.2219,1.5159,3.4172,0.0006,4.6844,3.6159,2.4476,1.7341,1.2183,2.5615,1.3034,5.4566,0.784,3.7844,0.6479,1.423,3.8808,1.4157,0.4734,2.3939,0.018,0.1121,0.7291,7.9376,0.3335,4.105,3.4512,6.3118,1.5472,3.1663,0.1423,2.2895,0.4419,7.3907,0.8264,3.7917,7.5588,5.1723,1.1254,1.413,0.914,2.27,0.1698,0.4127,1.4361,2.9484,1.7983,1.9367,0.0007,3.2472,3.0854,2.9764,0.7128,2.1489,0.4524,1.9973,8.8253,1.313,2.5398,1.1017,9.0679,1.001,0.7365,0.332,0.0014,0.6511,4.5231,0.4474,1.6221,2.1859,3.8977,2.4791,0.1172,3.8194,3.5318,0.1742,4.5664,2.7041,4.0568,5.2754,2.2308,3.3038,4.6708,6.7666,1.1643,6.4359,1.5538,2.6899,2.5972,1.5577,3.5582,2.0869,4.3647,3.4405,0.1397,0.9311,2.8336,12.7702,1.3268,0.7846,2.6085,3.753,2.9179,0.0615,5.5387,0.6655,6.7369,1.1749,4.1964,1.766,1.9472,5.1901,4.444,1.4388,1.7741,0.3613,1.4825,0.1728,2.5787,0.7577,1.4402,5.7519,0.7504,1.5829,0.1093,0.0512,6.3774,2.3614,4.328,2.7617,3.03,1.738,3.1294,2.3205,3.8087,0.3709,7.3231,0.1747,0.8947,0.0326,2.168,0.3288,4.6302,0.1715,0.1478,4.6091,1.0782,2.979,2.2349,3.809,1.7266,2.0076,0.0006,1.9983,4.6416,2.0712,0.6378,5.2537,0.809,1.1659,0.4995]}

But a lawsuit filed by three of de Blasio \u2019 s top advisers challenging the suit filed by de Blasio and the ACLU was thrown out by a trial court judge on Tuesday, prompting the ACLU to file an appeal Friday to overturn the ruling. Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, a New York court judge, struck down Trump \u2019 s attempts to extend a temporary ban on certain types of travel from six predominantly Muslim-majority countries imposed in January. That ban, which was subsequently extended a number of times and has remained in place for almost a year now, initially targeted only citizens from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. But last February, Trump issued a new executive order that expanded the ban to include six additional, mostly Muslim-majority countries and one of them has not been targeted for travel restrictions under Trump \u2019 s previous executive orders or the existing ban: Iraq. Last week, Trump issued a third extension of the ban. On Tuesday, Buchwald rejected a request from Trump to keep his ban in effect by a period that covered when it was first implemented \u2013 January \u2013 rather than allowing it to end by midnight on March 5. Trump has said he was extending the ban, which Trump declared unconstitutional last month, to address attacks on U.S. citizens and interests that have happened while the ban has been in place. But the American Civil Liberties Union and New York City were suing the Trump administration for violating the Constitution \u2019 s 14th Amendment right to free speech for having imposed travel restrictions, and the Justice Department has argued that the restrictions should survive. \u201c The travel ban does not serve a compelling national interest, the judge wrote, \u201c and to extend the ban through June would be unconstitutional because it would violate the 14th Amendment right to free speech.\u201d Justice Department spokesman Matthew Wood told CNN last week that the Trump administration is \u201c looking forward to a quick disposition on this issue by the courts.\u201d \u2014 Micky Gillette \u2014 PI:USER (CNN) More Related: US Judge Blocks Trump Travel Ban.

It cited senior government sources as saying that it had been accepted that money would have to be paid to Ireland as part of the agreement.According to the BBC, senior officials had already started discussing payments with ministers and officials in Brussels on Wednesday morning.Earlier commentators and lawmakers appeared to downplay what they called a rather thin proposal. The Irish Times reported that the UK is prepared to pay about \u00a33 billion as part of a broader fund that could include \u00a370 billion to help the country.The newspaper said that the Government is seeking ways to cover some of the costs of the Brexit agreement.An article in The Guardian said that the EU is also demanding a billing scheme that would see \u20ac250 billion (\u00a3184 billion) paid over seven years in exchange for guarantees that the UK has a secure trading relationship with the bloc.It cited EU officials as saying that the UK was prepared to accept this, but would also need to agree to a system of debt financing called \" backstop\".There has been no sign of the Brexit process ever getting any further since the Prime Minister, Theresa May, said at the end of last month that she could not reach an agreement to leave the EU without a backstop scheme.There have been widespread claims that the EU is prepared to let the UK remain in the bloc without a backstop.The EU offers to let Britain stay in the Customs Union and Single Market together with other states in the European Union, subject to a set of rules laid down by Brussels, which is seen as ensuring control over Britain's border with Ireland.Britain is threatening to leave the Customs Union, if there is no agreement to protect it from a hard border on the backstop.","token_len":492,"entropy":[11.0346,2.9656,3.7744,2.2563,1.2994,1.7822,1.1044,3.2835,1.3814,3.037,0.5602,1.7511,9.9827,3.672,7.3217,0.0544,0.0053,0.7075,1.561,1.7937,2.0935,4.9879,8.0833,0.8273,1.4646,2.2476,2.9946,3.0454,2.1348,7.7497,0.3601,2.1732,0.9582,2.0816,2.7659,4.7879,5.4066,5.1618,8.5381,3.7223,2.0301,8.9536,1.9312,0.5181,2.67,3.1448,0.0704,0.0011,0.556,1.2326,1.0612,4.1853,6.8176,2.5744,0.2442,3.2962,4.048,1.5979,4.803,0.0496,0.0014,2.8546,0.6037,2.1407,1.022,3.3243,4.7747,2.7699,4.3548,0.7705,6.1334,6.2033,6.5685,0.5795,7.6694,0.1174,6.3743,0.1021,0.1279,0.7385,2.5985,7.4168,1.5631,1.7528,6.9682,1.9939,4.534,5.0257,4.0824,3.9961,3.4311,0.4613,13.646,7.2107,0.0021,2.8769,2.1146,0.6169,1.4331,0.8757,1.6389,1.8622,5.1732,1.7689,0.2553,4.3087,4.1648,2.4633,0.2675,3.806,3.6151,4.1391,3.3519,7.1321,0.0577,6.1165,1.3955,1.5886,1.8052,2.6142,0.0525,7.6194,3.7516,3.9341,2.5906,5.5431,11.5073,6.2961,2.2885,1.9494,5.536,8.7322,6.1064,2.9886,3.8831,0.9737,0.3675,0.772,2.8822,4.3741,6.0468,3.1008,0.0751,4.9753,0.0014,5.6182,0.8975,2.9226,5.8256,1.2794,0.2508,2.3288,2.7687,4.906,0.6851,1.8846,2.9976,4.2493,5.5512,2.6264,1.6414,0.6474,0.0525,0.7016,2.9566,2.6857,1.8915,4.3739,1.9897,4.9705,0.9521,3.4913,0.0875,0.2067,0.4636,2.3567,4.8965,3.7179,1.1466,0.0014,0.6841,3.4036,0.7533,6.0074,0.006,0.9994,2.4834,0.4357,5.4082,2.1726,4.5859,3.2613,5.0888,3.2608,5.9924,1.651,4.3542,2.6745,3.0487,1.572,1.4465,3.1854,1.0126,2.9828,0.5958,5.458,10.5676,4.0468,5.2472,5.7672,0.5276,5.7936,0.0075,4.5045,1.3132,2.1154,1.116,7.2141,6.7462,4.8852,2.5514,3.3025,2.8812,2.7495,1.7826,0.4811,1.4625,3.9703,3.6841,3.1728,0.0354,0.9953,3.689,2.051,3.0175,2.1586,4.9175,0.2545,0.001,1.2485,5.3861,6.9098,2.6214,3.2434,2.3694,3.2829,5.3808,0.4867,2.1071,2.0596,2.1808,2.0898,5.015,2.1255,5.4841,0.8962,0.9227,1.2875,4.0441,2.4958,4.1235,7.428,0.38,3.7385,3.5313,0.2376,0.2084,1.3855,0.7177,0.8986,5.3843,4.8997,1.4531,5.5381,4.6947,0.6629,1.8382,3.1144,1.2641,0.5379,1.1778,3.9121,2.1091,3.7568,4.8247,2.2036,12.5036,1.3985,2.3019,0.6353,3.9457,5.603,5.0992,0.9292,4.1134,5.3861,0.1465,0.0946,1.7004,4.2134,3.9296,0.0302,3.7938,3.4676,0.006,4.8125,1.0754,1.5945,1.1591,5.1625,2.338,5.3518,6.4771,0.0989,0.1174,0.3367,3.8228,0.3712,2.8272,4.3153,4.0233,2.788,0.5276,0.0675,0.2921,1.1874,2.0199,2.2317,2.2697,0.057,2.4528,3.5909,3.1056,1.4285,2.7459,3.6907,3.5248,0.6367,3.0309,1.2928,1.6538,6.061,1.0215,5.981,4.3572,6.7199,1.9264,11.9859,3.4421,4.2443,5.0945,2.2159,0.2678,2.188,2.2296,0.6925,2.6768,4.4065,3.2093,5.8418,2.1003,3.1202,3.6866,5.5852,1.0226,4.7748,0.0049,3.6041,0.1573,0.0041,0.0994,2.4897,3.5323,0.6759,1.8518,0.0038,1.5677,0.9462,0.2293,0.8471,4.6213,0.9151,5.9928,1.1461,0.09,2.8171,3.0515,0.0341,0.8464,2.4366,1.8805,5.885,0.013,4.6318,0.682,4.993,1.7789,0.2628,6.4926,3.5389,0.5892,0.8477,2.9341,1.0779,4.2055,0.0289,4.6951,1.1379,0.321,5.0304,0.4101,0.2473,1.421,2.7616,0.8408,1.0461,0.0005,2.0504,2.8824,2.4572,8.3771,2.3699,3.3289,2.8951,1.7338,0.4134,0.6732,6.6687,0.0659,2.8297,7.2444,0.043,5.9286,0.9331,2.7238,5.3069,2.8353,1.4474,3.0243,0.7986,1.3266,6.3212,0.0687,1.505,4.3951,0.523,1.3997,5.9174,0.2446,0.4884,2.5998,2.5138,2.5052,2.8794,3.3558,0.2916,5.7718,6.3917,0.7764,5.058,0.075,4.3244,1.0151,2.785,0.575,5.1426,2.0694,8.7056,0.4104,1.8709,0.2434,4.0779,0.0104,2.5811,5.3205,3.6069,0.2067,1.4562,1.8606,1.7321,5.7786,1.9884,1.0355,2.8677,3.9863,0.3447,4.1475,0.4924,6.464,5.1159,0.924]}

They were checking if it was used for a possible terror attack, police said.\nThe raids come as Greece is stepping up security for the visit of Davutoglu and are linked to a rise in terror threats in the country.\nTurkey\u2019s foreign ministry said earlier on Tuesday that Davutoglu is on his way to Greece following a meeting between the two foreign ministers in London to discuss bilateral relations.\nDavutoglu will be in Athens on Wednesday and Thursday for a series of meetings, including with Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.\nThe police also seized two Kalashnikov-scoped guns and a portable video camera from the property in central Athens, police said, adding that there was no evidence that they had attempted to stage any attack.\nIn February, police arrested nine suspects believed to be affiliated with a Muslim Brotherhood militant group in Turkey. Greece and Turkey have drawn hard lines against the Syrian-led rebels who have fought in the civil war against the government in the Syrian capital, Damascus.\nGreece\u2019s opposition and human rights activists say the militant groups have had links to the radical group that has carried many terror attacks in Turkey in the past.\nActivists say that the group\u2019s anti-government campaign intensified after Turkey\u2019s military intervention in Syria in October and activists have branded them Turkish-backed al-Qaida operatives.\nThe authorities have previously searched five apartment buildings in Athens and arrested 11 suspects and seized thousands of kilograms of bomb-making chemicals and other explosives. Some of the apartments were in the possession of people believed to have links with various terror cells.\nIn 2013, a terrorist organization was detected in Athens by security services who searched a house in the area of Glyfada, where a home-made explosive device was found with two devices which remained under construction outside the home of a suspected mastermind.\nThe group was believed to be linked with al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian affiliate, and in November 2013 the European Parliament's Security Committee urged the authorities to ensure they get to the bottom of this group, which had links with ISIS in Syria.","token_len":492,"entropy":[7.6818,6.7658,8.2889,1.6078,0.183,1.8685,1.8676,5.9162,0.3772,1.3712,8.9276,1.5708,7.3586,1.6649,2.0793,2.6336,4.715,4.8131,4.7677,0.7995,4.2115,4.4224,1.3471,0.1502,3.0976,5.2379,3.0743,0.1369,3.1267,3.2898,8.6948,0.0007,2.6975,3.5533,3.3292,0.7993,2.3142,4.5552,0.0114,1.1051,0.0,0.0002,0.0491,0.0,0.9218,0.4424,21.352,3.2887,2.2871,3.093,3.512,0.0446,3.717,1.0172,4.1766,1.2163,0.0354,6.0516,0.4104,1.137,3.5762,8.6041,0.0742,3.9748,2.9185,2.8956,5.7193,5.3283,3.6016,0.3987,3.427,2.5243,1.9813,3.9362,2.8966,0.2177,1.6955,2.4671,0.3852,0.2796,0.2036,9.9835,2.7669,2.9909,1.4911,3.4369,2.3786,6.0217,0.011,1.7752,3.4314,2.107,6.4269,1.5018,1.9995,0.0075,0.001,1.4753,7.7297,5.2524,0.0777,1.0927,5.2141,0.0952,4.4294,3.7983,1.6123,1.1427,1.1607,0.6474,0.4007,3.761,15.5759,9.3498,3.5748,2.5877,0.9189,0.5975,4.8631,0.9146,0.5129,0.4299,6.352,0.0012,0.0006,4.3035,3.4682,1.3747,0.0668,0.1315,2.8715,5.5716,1.1023,2.02,3.1048,1.8457,1.7322,5.4719,0.0204,1.7564,4.0198,4.3726,0.3693,5.4399,1.4828,0.3433,0.267,3.1085,0.0084,0.0051,0.0006,3.9358,2.411,2.3891,1.2588,0.6397,1.7896,2.6713,2.7967,1.105,1.155,3.0409,0.001,1.4406,2.92,1.5485,3.498,2.5241,1.3559,0.0037,2.9475,0.0009,0.0001,0.0002,1.6855,0.3702,2.0984,4.932,3.4887,1.028,3.0216,4.7479,0.0012,0.0001,3.0944,10.0341,0.9478,3.955,1.1106,1.5768,5.6354,7.1859,0.2825,2.4372,1.3473,5.8278,2.4994,3.7262,0.0572,1.3192,2.1074,0.3838,2.7929,1.071,0.2379,3.929,1.0943,0.5803,0.9826,1.9849,2.5473,1.4343,6.4895,0.1151,6.7502,2.6569,2.7245,0.4182,0.192,3.737,4.9761,0.3625,2.2445,1.8847,5.0177,3.3884,5.9499,0.0157,0.5538,3.9716,0.144,1.8575,5.5242,2.0806,3.6062,0.0914,1.1632,2.6831,1.4635,6.8281,3.1338,0.6913,1.0112,6.4132,7.1189,3.1424,5.1297,1.6727,5.0871,3.3464,1.4766,5.4451,2.8723,0.6312,3.5059,2.9812,1.526,2.0705,0.0063,2.67,1.6458,0.9504,1.5886,3.068,4.1602,2.4821,1.5592,0.5636,0.2036,0.3638,4.661,0.0113,0.002,4.6412,0.049,0.0538,4.8339,3.2345,4.4337,0.0261,3.5079,1.7754,1.1756,6.0024,2.8847,1.4096,5.9763,3.766,0.3676,1.6623,4.7402,3.332,4.558,1.1325,2.4012,12.8668,6.4642,0.0709,0.7756,2.019,2.6,1.6615,0.1547,0.8821,0.545,6.5568,0.0869,1.2923,2.5975,1.7508,2.4933,12.7664,0.1028,0.0766,6.7098,0.0019,0.7948,3.5365,6.748,1.1627,3.0889,4.9429,0.0158,0.0055,1.9652,2.9231,0.277,1.408,0.7438,4.1968,3.0328,7.6124,2.2591,6.9194,2.8782,5.954,1.8889,0.9872,4.6164,0.3583,2.046,4.7908,0.3221,0.4625,2.133,5.2738,1.5498,5.5795,6.4728,4.9296,3.9738,0.8933,0.7546,2.0862,1.4065,2.4386,4.3577,3.5011,3.531,2.9038,5.3596,0.1347,5.7289,0.0676,5.4409,0.24,0.0036,4.6751,1.7703,1.818,3.0137,0.9462,5.8482,0.7469,0.5336,6.6602,1.2624,3.8703,1.3536,5.5429,0.0015,4.2006,3.4088,0.0062,1.3623,1.8652,2.8505,6.1329,2.9681,4.4595,0.9226,0.3289,3.147,5.395,0.1651,1.9362,5.6664,4.1564,3.5339,6.7913,0.9502,2.1267,3.8685,3.3191,2.1396,3.7838,3.1476,1.6229,2.3846,0.9678,0.6094,3.8853,1.8078,8.7744,2.5645,9.225,2.2899,2.7144,1.9591,5.7005,4.7119,0.8962,2.6712,2.2763,0.5379,0.3061,4.8502,4.9508,5.7867,4.7661,9.3253,3.0964,3.5179,7.5563,0.9771,3.3977,2.9555,1.1841,3.3817,6.1169,0.8552,0.598,1.9062,3.8011,1.8755,3.474,0.0129,1.2252,1.6398,2.3618,2.3429,0.105,0.142,9.2121,0.0241,2.4373,2.8397,0.3568,1.284,3.519,3.4674,3.5555,2.4618,2.6733,4.6917,2.641,4.0976,2.6135,1.9632,4.2724,1.4371,2.7571,0.1303,5.921,4.3467,7.6241,2.9498,0.165,0.2131,0.0035,4.049,2.955,2.8595,2.1315,3.4617,2.7843,1.6666,4.5244,2.845,0.7781,0.6782]}

Read more at\nThe most popular video games are the ones that appeal to a broad range of ages and interests, not just children at younger ages. They are also the ones that give you as adults the chance to relive the same memorable experience once again as well. This year has just about every game out there and there are so many possibilities that you can do.\nIf you want a game that is unique, or perhaps one that was never played before, here are some of the best video games that have never been released, but should. Of course, they are not actual video games, but the ideas and plans behind them that were never created are worth following along with.\nDo you ever play video games like Skyrim? Well, not really because the game doesn\u2019t have much of a storyline to go around. Instead, the characters are a group of knights, and you can choose the one that is your most liked in the cast. This is a game that just lets the user do what they want to do, and have fun with it.\nIf you want to get a game that is similar to World of Warcraft, but one that has more of a storyline to it, there is World War Z Zombies. There are many levels, and you have to fight against an army of zombies. The game is not going to get any worse for the player once they reach a level where they have been facing a lot of zombies by the end of the battle.\nThere is also this game called Dragon Age Inquisition. The game lets the users pick their character and then starts the adventure for them. There are many decisions that they come across and they have to figure out how to deal with them. Even though the game sounds boring, it is interesting and fun to play.\nThere are also other games that are similar to Skyrim and other older games. That being said, they all have characters that are not even as interesting as the storyline. The storyline is important because it keeps things interesting and enjoyable. If they have one and things don\u2019t, then there will be no reason to continue playing the game.","token_len":492,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,6.5819,1.6121,7.0482,7.9536,4.208,1.8086,1.8787,0.0111,0.361,1.4012,0.0094,3.7515,1.5909,0.671,6.2322,2.6548,3.2244,7.7226,1.7594,3.1204,1.1975,1.3244,5.3568,2.9431,2.3884,3.471,1.2636,3.2746,3.6345,3.4263,0.0014,2.852,0.34,2.8176,0.0832,4.756,1.8025,2.3011,4.5424,1.0951,5.6591,0.8396,1.58,0.2575,6.3192,3.2684,7.8566,3.2212,5.8721,5.8323,0.7257,1.1659,0.0161,0.0797,9.4252,7.8267,0.6511,2.9053,6.1941,12.3215,6.8159,5.789,4.9438,6.8534,2.0331,3.9086,3.1464,0.9812,4.313,0.0711,2.5646,1.4217,2.086,0.0066,3.7456,1.2287,3.0433,1.1874,4.3001,0.3503,3.7359,6.6167,6.043,0.0388,0.3969,4.1159,1.4873,1.7437,2.344,1.861,0.5679,4.7669,3.0661,7.7374,10.4381,1.5864,2.2338,0.0217,7.1717,0.0649,1.2479,4.586,5.2449,5.1632,6.4864,1.7324,4.2295,3.3319,2.8837,4.1798,1.5932,3.962,6.4613,3.5381,3.5521,1.4889,3.751,0.0567,4.1335,2.9022,0.7341,2.8346,0.0165,5.2829,3.2665,1.7161,0.9326,4.3512,6.1349,2.4468,4.2748,0.2707,2.2803,3.2676,2.0812,0.8933,2.3085,4.0976,1.5874,3.8775,5.0831,3.8918,0.3432,5.0945,3.5675,1.7667,0.8922,0.3144,3.456,0.264,1.0634,1.0463,0.2567,1.3407,3.2991,0.1247,2.2993,1.9581,3.1927,0.1934,1.8227,3.0322,2.7217,5.1426,3.9292,7.6147,0.4597,0.3571,3.4601,1.1798,1.5542,7.0352,2.2537,0.0231,1.0762,0.4823,3.3971,5.6983,1.2508,7.771,2.9866,0.36,3.9209,3.0926,3.7362,3.781,2.1178,4.5721,5.1296,3.1227,0.7342,0.5514,0.7627,5.7947,1.2178,3.892,2.843,3.005,0.0139,4.734,5.5102,1.3029,4.0944,0.25,4.3809,1.6255,3.9225,3.0176,1.9527,3.5215,16.4754,6.9082,2.3108,1.5321,2.5608,1.6826,0.6784,3.3976,3.0645,4.2923,3.8362,0.7595,2.4618,0.1521,2.3032,4.1547,1.4597,3.6278,4.2616,0.0465,7.5615,1.9271,2.5122,2.0701,1.9628,2.523,3.6585,3.5581,1.3492,2.4313,2.5664,3.7176,7.0186,3.6136,0.8982,8.5983,0.8353,3.1621,1.1611,1.6898,1.8618,0.6044,5.673,6.6348,4.9739,5.98,3.4994,1.6313,0.5146,0.3819,2.7183,0.1337,1.0729,1.0665,6.6026,0.7501,1.8532,0.443,0.265,1.2828,2.8098,0.1752,1.7343,0.646,3.4821,2.5493,2.3851,0.5765,1.0631,6.1954,0.3781,5.4493,0.0926,0.03,0.479,3.3791,6.039,0.5883,2.2038,2.4749,2.2256,0.4412,2.5289,2.4705,0.3658,0.2441,3.1207,2.0551,3.1172,5.288,1.1071,10.4944,0.8427,3.5154,0.6323,2.5259,4.3319,1.6197,1.4348,1.859,2.1381,0.4828,2.644,3.6925,3.7836,0.9473,0.2466,0.6099,2.3802,1.9958,1.6247,1.4251,3.6459,5.4142,0.0866,3.8301,2.4277,5.9872,4.0138,2.6816,2.703,4.6424,1.9572,3.1965,3.4044,2.7883,1.6842,1.184,2.3702,4.6406,7.1011,2.4204,2.801,0.0684,0.6641,7.4706,1.3328,0.8318,0.3702,0.2849,5.9442,0.2986,1.0158,3.5149,1.3388,1.3951,5.2935,1.3822,0.964,4.7751,1.4622,4.5718,0.959,2.1795,0.9923,5.0537,3.7043,7.4969,5.256,1.7632,2.3139,1.3999,3.8347,6.5552,2.247,4.4441,4.6901,0.6915,0.5727,3.0249,0.5745,1.7948,7.7934,1.0041,3.8818,7.1368,3.069,2.6132,2.2999,2.3663,0.1542,3.9999,0.0904,1.0605,0.2003,2.664,0.0042,1.136,0.6049,5.557,1.304,1.2815,0.8894,6.8144,4.7701,0.5475,1.0693,0.9479,4.8241,1.6636,2.9507,1.1159,0.6307,0.5168,0.6034,2.9178,0.5244,1.6782,2.5951,0.7819,0.8203,1.5354,1.965,0.4196,3.4621,2.166,3.5442,5.7717,0.7127,1.6048,5.4437,3.1474,0.0112,0.0295,3.1174,2.9512,0.6646,5.7461,0.8099,1.1732,3.3285,5.0877,4.0155,2.845,0.4371,0.8667,7.6382,1.4509,2.4753,5.7543,1.0599,4.7774,2.2154,0.9041,4.4844,3.2298,0.5752,1.3378,5.4889,1.002,3.3326,5.0612,2.8239,4.5744,5.3873,8.7881,2.4378,5.23,0.3204,0.0697,3.9813,0.8793,2.8046,3.203,0.2309,1.8476,3.8587,0.6229,2.9088,1.049,1.3713,0.1876,0.5174]}
{"prompt":"British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump was wrong to retweet a video from a far-right British group which she said was hateful and spreads division . Trump sparked","text":"British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump was wrong to retweet a video from a far-right British group which she said was hateful and spreads division. Trump sparked criticism last year when he retweeted a video featuring a series of British Conservative politicians talking in support of Brexit, part of a wider surge in hate speech directed at the US president. May responded Thursday by telling a conference of British ministers organized by the Conservative Party's National Policy Committee that Trump's tweet showed that he had a disregard for rules and regulations under an American president. \"The British Government and the people in this country reject any disrespect for rules and regulations and are determined to uphold British law and democracy,\" May said, adding that Trump's tweet \"must be considered an example of a failure to obey British law, as well as a reflection on the man that it would show.\" Trump sparked an outcry after he retweeted a video featuring a series of British Conservative politicians talking in support of Brexit in September, part of a wider surge in hate speech directed at the US president. Trump and his supporters have claimed that the election was marred by widespread voter fraud, but Trump's allies have been quick to point out that their own political leaders have committed numerous errors during the pandemic, which has worsened the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Some have also been accused of spreading misinformation about the coronavirus. In that tweet to Trump, the BreXiter politicians wrote their signature line: \"Trump must go!\" May also pointed out that the video depicted a series of politicians speaking in a room, which she said \"denies the reality that we are a democracy; rather he [Trump] denies the reality that democracies do have rules, as he refuses to honor them here in America and all around the world. \" Her comments came a day after the White House denounced a Twitter thread in which Trump and members of his administration promoted the misleading conspiracy that the 2020 election was \"badged,\" meaning rigged. The comments also came as the White House, in an apparent bid to put Trump out of the picture, announced it was canceling the Trump Organization's lucrative contracts to control the media.

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump has abandoned plans to create an infrastructure advisory council , the White House said on Thursday , the day after two other advisory groups were dismantled over the furor caused by","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump has abandoned plans to create an infrastructure advisory council, the White House said on Thursday, the day after two other advisory groups were dismantled over the furor caused by his decision to cut funding for them. The U.S. Treasury Department said the Trump administration would drop plans for an infrastructure advisory council, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it will drop its advisory role as part of measures to cut government spending. A third advisory group will see its funding cut in a deal between senators and administration officials. The government says it has already identified what should be included in the U.S. infrastructure investment, which the Trump administration aims to reach at $1.5 trillion over five years. Its workforce development plan, set to be unveiled in three weeks, will also highlight a strategy to recruit and train workers, as well as new technologies needed for jobs in the 21st century.\nIn an extraordinary statement, the White House said late Wednesday that it would stop sending workers to Haiti after a deadly earthquake that killed more than 7,000 people there this week. Trump took office only five months ago, and his signature achievement, his executive action on immigration, has still stalled. \u201cBy announcing yesterday that the federal government would stop sending workers to the Bahamas, Haiti and other places, we were doing precisely what we warned would happen as a result of such a decision,\u201d wrote U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas Dan Frieden in the statement. The statement said the decision to stop sending federal personnel to foreign disaster relief began Friday, with Haiti\u2019s International Crisis Group warning of repercussions. The statement went on to say that the Trump administration would begin a process to identify \u201cwhich of our nation\u2019s government agencies can take further action\u201d in their efforts to prevent further disasters at home and abroad. In recent weeks, Democrats have used congressional hearings and a Democratic-led Congress to push for a more robust disaster response in the aftermath of natural disasters, and they have sought changes in the way federal aid is distributed once a disaster occurs. President Trump has also questioned the size of federal government response. \u201cMy plan is to send our troops to help the citizens,\u201d Trump said last week, after heavy rains hit Puerto Rico. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for us to send U.S. troops. We got people around the world to do that for us.\u201d","token_len":493,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,2.9623,8.6565,3.5943,0.1472,5.1965,2.3847,4.7417,6.5187,1.3397,1.5492,2.8354,1.2213,0.0007,0.5308,1.8556,1.7676,1.5004,4.108,3.4177,0.3009,5.8267,3.9283,3.7139,2.7558,1.8192,7.7942,4.2158,1.2578,9.9231,0.0044,7.1401,0.0191,3.0327,2.8563,0.5291,3.8999,1.2268,0.5674,4.6139,0.2054,3.8074,5.5439,0.0006,0.0147,0.0187,3.3626,0.2775,1.9203,2.0216,3.5224,0.1892,2.0216,6.1237,3.8674,1.7588,1.723,1.942,1.6362,0.3591,1.7901,1.5784,4.7689,0.001,0.008,0.0027,5.9174,0.0048,0.0001,0.3948,2.0477,2.422,3.702,0.9029,4.7207,5.2735,3.8576,2.838,0.0024,7.4997,0.2682,4.6149,2.9488,0.8096,0.6322,4.4852,5.3763,1.1588,0.1116,2.3043,6.9594,1.0106,1.1352,0.4471,2.4803,3.2602,4.3679,3.581,8.3845,0.8833,4.406,0.1646,1.1581,1.8074,5.3924,4.4117,0.8338,2.3222,2.8786,4.9614,5.5035,5.5656,0.2687,2.229,0.2917,0.5082,4.0176,0.0006,0.0026,0.023,2.327,3.7639,3.2704,2.7222,3.2854,3.1739,0.048,5.988,0.0282,5.6713,3.4321,2.8016,1.9352,0.8496,1.8572,0.0548,2.1158,2.2495,0.0242,0.3279,6.4344,8.1898,8.1692,2.1578,2.0379,4.5824,0.4279,0.628,1.6218,1.3974,6.3476,0.9653,0.0619,2.481,3.1875,6.3882,3.6558,5.2659,0.5917,5.8033,2.0856,0.9522,3.5336,2.3995,3.2822,0.1011,0.0077,5.1693,3.206,4.9916,1.5812,4.0027,1.2219,0.889,4.9264,0.0451,0.1509,0.2871,1.735,11.9255,2.4687,5.4979,5.7145,0.504,1.1745,1.0369,0.0038,0.3901,8.4747,1.6845,0.4723,1.3615,1.7005,4.1179,4.8081,4.0641,0.3002,4.9006,2.6041,2.4057,5.0413,0.665,2.2649,0.746,1.1669,0.0036,5.0315,0.0337,0.3991,0.1226,5.1963,3.9996,1.2122,0.4241,4.3358,4.782,0.7615,6.8238,4.5056,1.9215,0.5116,0.8311,1.334,2.2671,6.6869,5.3681,2.6483,2.4984,3.4665,2.9899,0.7833,1.3403,0.4841,1.2171,6.4555,5.8357,0.9714,13.0301,6.1705,8.0854,5.4256,6.8221,0.2527,1.8851,4.5552,0.1079,0.6279,2.7235,0.4331,1.0545,0.1129,3.2082,7.3403,0.8337,7.7153,1.4402,1.3817,3.9272,3.4797,5.1822,2.9269,3.9479,6.1258,0.4204,1.7282,6.8657,2.0779,0.5941,5.2236,1.6729,0.5533,0.004,6.2328,0.9035,3.6751,2.8583,11.7034,6.5282,9.1802,4.2258,0.0019,0.0055,0.0057,2.389,0.3288,0.247,1.8542,4.8689,7.576,3.0026,1.6666,3.4436,3.3429,0.4431,2.6866,4.0158,1.985,1.2664,3.1822,1.2476,2.3499,0.4536,5.342,5.5623,0.3063,6.8832,7.5511,2.9986,6.6067,6.111,1.3788,3.2832,5.3054,13.448,8.1492,3.1787,6.3439,5.1728,0.2737,5.6999,2.0863,8.4193,1.9706,1.7417,3.0946,4.35,0.0269,0.1006,0.6089,0.5912,1.2434,3.6931,0.0857,1.8875,3.8082,2.782,2.7908,0.8444,4.7801,11.18,0.4658,4.3919,2.8498,3.5672,4.4212,0.7731,1.9049,0.012,3.9518,3.4488,4.2828,4.0258,7.1975,0.4374,1.3073,2.7804,2.7665,5.9951,3.1667,0.1488,3.2893,2.9454,1.7297,6.1007,1.4602,0.7821,0.1642,0.1913,3.3724,5.5453,0.9875,0.0805,7.5516,0.8501,4.6191,5.8218,2.5084,1.587,3.1389,5.9535,1.2583,0.3859,2.3331,0.1365,2.4116,1.2129,2.0116,3.2219,2.7277,6.351,0.5457,2.994,0.9197,2.2358,0.0074,5.0581,0.1186,1.4736,2.0969,2.6667,0.7422,4.6609,6.5188,0.8719,0.9598,2.0755,2.5216,4.3827,0.4602,0.9252,8.7617,1.8973,0.2363,1.6597,0.2307,4.8664,1.26,1.4199,2.3519,6.586,0.9275,6.4154,0.2236,2.2829,3.4203,6.2547,3.6379,5.0153,0.3495,7.2259,5.6682,1.3374,0.5547,2.5351,3.9432,2.4497,0.7873,3.4248,3.0279,4.6161,4.3489,3.6178,1.5969,5.331,0.9919,3.3422,0.6178,1.1379,4.2517,9.518,2.1522,3.2897,3.5541,0.0007,0.9588,3.3569,0.0666,4.7774,4.8717,0.3127,0.034,1.423,2.9147,1.9973,1.2861,0.1531,1.0818,5.2794,0.0026,0.0018,0.0068,0.3178,2.7905,1.7064,5.7541,4.6993,6.8566,0.7592,0.775,2.8661,3.2251,1.6736,4.5453,0.584,0.5565,2.7733,1.745]}

It has said any new agreement needs to address the border issue.","token_len":494,"entropy":[11.0346,3.2041,6.8915,0.2896,7.8445,4.1112,0.3315,1.5479,1.7215,3.5754,2.6691,4.3665,5.697,5.4235,0.4437,2.7209,2.9842,1.5118,5.3899,0.0213,5.2225,3.7239,0.3134,6.0323,0.2082,0.6448,7.6826,0.001,0.3614,0.0015,5.7497,4.8485,7.0409,8.5705,2.591,0.4906,6.1,3.7627,0.4193,0.1677,14.888,4.6033,1.2858,1.685,5.7611,0.2651,4.306,3.222,0.5255,2.7534,2.0709,1.2666,6.4452,0.3075,6.6849,0.0278,0.6724,6.4996,3.6626,9.7329,2.8435,0.6377,6.0118,0.954,10.3526,5.3344,4.985,3.7464,3.7721,4.4578,1.5517,5.5673,0.1274,1.2982,0.3491,4.3643,2.1725,2.7632,5.4307,0.0874,0.9143,3.6806,2.8407,5.4428,0.4902,2.8438,3.0236,3.5009,0.7313,1.3646,2.5013,1.8367,2.3233,4.0273,6.0691,0.0027,0.1047,0.5483,0.0004,3.1841,0.2582,3.8031,3.9967,1.5362,3.1605,3.3819,4.3104,0.6995,0.323,1.2311,0.3073,10.6938,8.3717,8.6259,11.7791,13.3265,3.6056,2.4677,4.9931,1.0195,4.1418,3.19,0.6381,1.1134,0.6581,4.7364,0.5842,6.4032,0.0468,0.3097,0.7052,3.1443,3.4756,7.7535,10.817,4.0701,0.3053,8.5184,6.2425,3.5454,1.4477,0.8324,1.4,3.1676,5.1742,5.361,0.548,3.5475,1.3925,0.3896,0.3209,0.4294,1.8689,1.1495,4.3128,1.4446,0.1523,0.7915,4.9897,3.4571,4.2241,1.1483,1.6339,2.6183,2.1787,3.4637,2.3946,4.6774,2.8123,2.7941,5.6267,0.973,1.7313,0.0068,2.4054,1.4713,4.4288,2.1926,1.5741,2.5643,0.3899,1.0428,5.9907,3.3148,1.4037,1.0364,2.4729,0.1586,1.4706,1.6269,2.4845,0.7674,1.2619,0.1548,2.6994,2.46,4.9952,7.4782,2.4172,1.7349,0.8609,1.5279,0.4371,1.773,1.9877,1.3361,6.5343,0.0854,4.1808,4.5399,1.1535,0.6008,0.94,1.957,0.096,0.879,0.0023,11.111,7.1918,2.614,5.0152,1.9784,4.6066,4.1348,1.8723,7.1542,0.4065,0.4338,0.0135,2.6605,0.9474,2.419,0.4128,0.2044,0.2782,0.5333,0.1215,3.1541,4.0437,1.2086,4.7492,2.6024,4.4319,5.3282,4.2682,2.5978,1.9112,0.2372,0.3356,1.484,7.6828,1.4523,1.6208,4.4227,6.017,5.2726,6.9539,1.8135,0.8775,0.0852,1.3086,0.7131,2.7927,0.4878,1.0881,0.3955,0.5336,4.1593,1.6799,4.7321,4.5673,5.5737,0.0185,1.4026,1.6787,4.0361,4.6402,1.2515,6.2067,1.4569,1.8515,3.7622,2.1147,4.112,0.0649,2.2484,4.7081,0.2139,3.4442,3.2479,2.2736,4.5911,1.6137,3.8854,7.5005,2.9925,1.1553,0.022,0.4043,0.2058,2.4481,2.6671,0.9579,1.1442,4.1994,0.4105,7.4382,0.8368,4.5666,9.7381,0.9173,0.6267,6.0238,0.0567,0.001,5.9229,2.6345,1.0112,1.0561,2.0741,0.6606,2.2546,0.7075,2.7167,2.3756,0.0223,3.1903,1.976,6.4059,0.0129,0.0007,4.1676,7.7453,2.3881,5.6329,1.3732,7.3577,0.0024,3.3749,3.1699,2.8678,1.8424,11.9208,0.1054,0.049,2.4031,0.8937,3.8312,0.002,1.4322,4.8483,0.9763,0.6545,0.2201,4.7043,1.4905,4.1839,1.1028,8.4088,1.057,2.6642,1.3996,6.5229,8.4354,0.2366,0.8002,7.271,4.7575,3.6209,2.1628,4.8244,7.0896,0.9101,6.8804,0.0054,6.6835,4.3451,0.0001,3.1122,1.4241,5.1921,0.0167,0.0144,9.3245,1.5304,7.3864,5.2778,8.3142,0.9308,3.1125,1.7292,4.0557,0.0769,4.2826,1.3951,1.3321,3.0437,2.6463,1.1985,0.3763,0.169,4.5589,3.8102,0.7719,0.8963,7.0069,3.2694,6.9102,0.9127,7.4558,2.7751,0.9263,4.4235,1.2542,3.9532,0.8482,1.0938,8.744,8.7656,0.2772,1.8494,2.2486,2.7795,1.8605,2.2943,0.0685,4.8473,4.0191,6.1097,5.2109,1.0762,0.6718,1.5996,1.46,2.687,5.033,5.9682,4.3194,5.9177,1.1017,3.1599,1.5389,1.5991,2.871,0.4853,0.5333,5.4286,3.7208,4.7365,4.0501,0.2246,0.1849,1.9701,2.7766,0.9504,5.4665,0.1683,4.5315,0.0489,3.869,1.523,1.8506,0.3366,5.6565,1.1138,3.4203,4.3017,0.3023,2.281,1.2252,4.218,3.1821,1.0199,8.3212,4.9177,0.9524,1.6234,0.4288,2.1372,0.5514,3.4346,1.986,1.5057,4.355,4.204,2.4638,4.6883,0.2008,6.6879,1.5575,3.6434,1.8001,1.9323]}

North Korea said it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile in a breakthrough for the country s nuclear weapons program. The move came as Pyongyang hosted the top foreign representatives of the Asian peninsula at a summit on security, diplomacy and the Korean peninsula. The North Koreans said the top-level event, held in Pyongyang, had been a success and that it had taken a major step towards reunification with South Korea.\nBy Mark McInnes AP FILE - In this May 13, 2015, photo, Secretary of Defense James Mattis holds up the Star-Spangled Banner for the President and the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington.\nThe chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who leads the U.S. defense services, told the Associated Press that the ballistic missiles were capable of carrying a nuclear warhead to target the U.S. mainland and that he expected them to be deployed sooner rather than later. Mattis did not say if the missiles would travel more than 3,000 miles since that would be classified information. But the Pentagon has said a nuclear strike would be the goal. Mattis said the ballistic launches constituted \u201can act of aggression\u201d designed to \u201csend a message.\u201d He also said the U.S. and its allies \u201cshould consider options\u201d to avoid another confrontation with Pyongyang. In March, U.S. military officials in South Korea told reporters there was no indication that the North Koreans intended to deploy the missiles to their coasts in the near future. North Korea says the missiles are aimed for the United States but has said the missile launches constitute just a \u201cnormal\u201d exercise.

{"prompt":"A backlash against \u201c bump stock \u201d gun accessories , which enable rifles to be turned into rapid-fire guns , grew in the U.S. Congress on Thursday as House Speaker Paul Ryan opened the door","text":"A backlash against \u201c bump stock \u201d gun accessories, which enable rifles to be turned into rapid-fire guns, grew in the U.S. Congress on Thursday as House Speaker Paul Ryan opened the door for a ban on accessories that change weapons beyond their factory-designed functions.\nIf no ban came this fall, it would have been the first time the U.S. Congress had tried to tackle a longstanding problem that has fuelled the U.S. military\u2019s war in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n\u201cThere is a real belief in the public about accessories that change the ability to fight,\u201d Ryan said, calling for legislation that targets the bump stock \u2013 a fire control accessory that allows weapons to be turned from a conventional to a so-called \u201c extreme distance \u201d or \u201c close quarters \u201d mode and back again.\nMr. Ryan was speaking at the NRA annual meeting in Orlando, Florida, where members of a bipartisan group of lawmakers gathered to highlight their opposition to a possible ban.\nThe NRA pushed back against Mr. Ryan\u2019s proposal as it seeks to limit the influence of gun rights activists ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Its annual meeting usually draws thousands of gun owners from across the United States.\nSupporters of the NRA have criticised Republicans for trying to curb their power ahead of the elections, which are expected to pit President Barack Obama against a series of Republican candidates in presidential elections.\nThe proposed action would come at a critical time for gun owners in the midst of a violent shooting season, with nearly 130 people killed by gunfire last year and the possibility that the next year will top that total.\n\u201cThe NRA has been working diligently since the terrorist attacks to make our gun control laws stronger, and we are going to continue to do so,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. We can\u2019t allow groups with less than morality standing to destroy this effort.\n\u201cThe NRA is not doing much against the gun crime that is going on now,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on a gun control committee in Congress. \u201cThe problem is gun confiscation and not accessories. \u201d\nGun lobby groups say a ban would harm gun owners. They say it could open the door to a lawsuit against manufacturers for violating federal law, and call the NRA\u2019s tactics \u201coutdated\u201d and \u201cpreposterous\u201d.","token_len":494,"entropy":[12.0443,1.4941,12.7919,6.1785,13.6242,8.7501,3.1429,5.2116,9.6676,6.4331,2.892,2.8226,7.6284,6.0597,0.3281,1.6415,6.0733,0.8409,7.5536,1.0902,0.0252,3.7904,1.3623,7.6838,2.2369,1.9022,3.2827,0.0005,0.0127,0.1324,5.9558,3.1196,2.0218,2.8089,5.0103,2.2137,0.538,0.1048,7.8358,1.3443,0.737,1.3099,1.7465,4.1834,0.1621,6.8046,1.3537,7.5044,4.5721,9.101,2.0682,4.6434,1.485,5.3792,5.0118,0.3226,0.2631,17.3601,6.9298,2.5134,6.8889,5.3495,2.9457,0.0983,2.3145,0.8992,2.9575,1.7057,1.5792,0.6498,0.423,2.1843,2.359,0.0003,0.0032,0.0036,2.1909,1.9904,4.2143,0.2394,6.3922,1.9441,5.6414,1.1042,2.1928,1.3311,7.6698,2.5054,5.9249,0.0005,0.0025,0.2428,2.0304,14.5551,5.9839,3.3517,6.3785,1.6011,0.9739,1.0936,4.0318,0.3989,0.454,5.4112,1.233,8.551,1.5912,1.547,4.141,7.5174,2.0205,0.9694,3.5966,5.5959,7.3397,0.7955,2.0755,1.7237,5.2703,1.9329,5.6821,1.8294,4.5914,5.3478,7.3197,0.5186,1.7035,5.3778,2.5796,3.0707,1.057,6.2679,1.8021,6.2146,0.2807,7.9518,1.4595,6.997,3.6625,1.699,0.6254,2.3219,4.534,0.3825,0.8525,0.353,4.5749,2.3827,5.3336,4.9947,0.5321,8.6138,0.0266,0.0018,8.4761,0.4558,9.7322,9.3864,5.4711,0.5604,4.5601,6.2218,0.5001,6.8431,7.1792,2.6387,0.0601,5.9403,4.5874,5.6196,3.0165,0.5307,0.36,6.9043,0.011,0.9152,4.3007,2.0287,1.1236,1.1015,3.9564,2.6976,0.8173,0.588,3.5223,0.4733,1.5864,0.3746,1.299,3.9322,0.6305,4.487,2.846,0.3281,1.2258,1.3074,3.6799,0.5528,5.3859,2.9076,3.5216,0.1096,2.3705,5.8229,0.3272,1.845,0.6602,1.7994,2.5885,6.1216,1.1189,1.0117,2.4963,0.0003,0.0669,6.3175,1.935,0.1438,1.3685,4.1973,2.4944,3.968,0.1715,3.9042,0.8904,5.7042,0.0844,2.2674,4.3804,2.7158,7.5445,0.0042,0.9314,3.5116,0.0003,0.7757,1.5771,0.633,5.2763,6.725,0.775,6.8119,2.159,2.8645,0.2144,1.8132,1.3635,2.0522,0.8973,0.0578,4.8097,0.0013,1.3771,0.309,6.1674,0.3082,0.856,3.2997,3.6087,8.1041,6.0999,0.4261,3.6686,0.0337,4.7265,2.6708,3.2535,5.8819,0.0072,0.6908,3.7815,1.023,2.6007,1.9419,1.3268,0.1992,6.0609,2.8545,1.1193,0.0059,0.5163,4.0359,6.0486,0.001,1.6013,1.8095,2.0658,5.4737,2.0569,1.1974,0.4743,1.8442,5.4133,6.2143,1.703,5.3331,2.4301,0.1553,2.7971,0.5315,0.3288,2.8338,2.7626,2.0799,0.5524,5.5964,0.001,0.7447,6.5844,4.7076,3.8617,2.2541,1.8974,4.5556,5.8737,0.6237,0.5166,2.2709,2.3358,3.0555,0.5099,2.4336,2.4961,5.1466,1.3922,2.6065,3.8925,3.6353,1.6554,8.9996,0.8035,3.2477,0.2954,0.3748,3.5553,0.1204,1.6753,2.4996,1.7484,1.9557,3.1345,5.5322,3.7097,1.6512,6.3905,0.302,4.535,3.7826,7.1762,4.1685,4.1899,0.9006,3.9146,1.1114,2.927,1.9368,1.4439,5.0135,0.2137,0.855,0.5131,1.1348,0.7391,2.3207,0.9837,2.5662,1.3357,0.0006,0.0889,0.3092,0.6106,5.9629,4.4239,10.6285,5.1843,0.0247,3.9789,6.3623,4.2973,6.6219,1.7166,16.3388,8.1923,2.0772,5.8532,4.3262,5.2952,0.7941,0.4456,1.9387,0.0446,1.9964,1.7211,1.4919,2.9671,4.7888,4.6614,6.0323,1.8803,3.1978,8.6259,3.3216,1.7004,2.6359,0.0763,3.537,1.0675,0.7692,0.833,2.6318,2.4175,3.5844,1.8632,0.0001,0.0,0.5003,1.3716,2.2088,0.101,0.0508,5.0669,4.7239,0.4724,1.1618,2.737,3.0219,0.2904,4.3081,0.1184,2.1625,2.8247,0.4693,6.2235,7.8201,0.0331,2.3155,4.807,8.2963,1.0244,2.5081,4.4926,2.5311,6.7956,6.1195,1.0187,3.1691,4.1271,0.2651,1.6337,4.8058,3.1283,0.8214,2.6536,3.5542,1.1394,2.1867,2.3359,4.5982,0.7491,0.1365,0.5569,2.5461,6.2872,2.586,2.5288,3.3006,4.5469,2.2969,0.6751,1.8992,1.7378,6.8729,2.3172,2.9173,6.2456,1.1207,0.0814,4.866,7.4446,0.5441,4.85,2.0555,3.2327,0.9863,2.9771,6.6157,0.3369,6.3872,0.0164,0.0156,1.5004,0.1037,0.436]}

We decided to return to Egypt and be with Yasser Qatadah because he was the head of the Brotherhood security in Aqaba. I took them by buses that we borrowed\u2026\nQattadh is reported to be a key figure in the Brotherhood in Aqaba and had received an offer to join the terrorist organisation ISIS (Islamic State) in Syria. Qatadah was also charged over a series of other attacks that took place in the town of Aqaba.\nIn all, 15 people were jailed for involvement with the terror ring after the security court in Aqaba sentenced them to between 10 and 15 years in prison.\nThe prosecution has appealed against one of the death sentences, and the Supreme Court is due to rule on the matter in November.","token_len":495,"entropy":[7.724,7.0073,5.1783,1.4884,6.5999,2.6962,2.0917,2.0389,4.1842,4.7434,5.1434,0.4421,1.8613,1.5678,5.191,6.7555,1.7352,0.4563,2.4156,0.3538,1.5883,1.5323,1.1723,0.0163,1.729,3.0546,0.4585,2.9604,1.3261,0.4941,3.1716,1.622,9.0389,2.471,3.0188,3.6212,3.3672,1.0117,1.9434,0.3272,1.5588,17.4027,5.2554,0.0099,0.7278,0.108,3.1254,6.2558,0.6537,0.3326,4.9583,0.0104,2.5424,2.3733,3.6049,1.1743,5.506,1.3529,0.0169,4.3195,4.378,2.0721,3.2151,0.9094,4.5909,1.664,3.2721,0.0983,4.6316,3.4567,3.7698,2.3482,4.2797,0.1925,3.956,0.1118,1.8148,0.004,1.211,2.755,0.3661,3.5803,2.7165,1.2356,2.0875,0.6766,1.2116,2.1928,2.851,0.0127,3.7174,1.5944,0.3152,3.3907,3.0671,4.5044,3.6064,0.5498,0.1075,1.0809,0.5051,4.2004,5.9743,0.4579,1.6746,0.9875,2.2378,3.605,1.478,1.6252,5.6148,0.1841,0.8065,6.3077,3.9355,0.1229,0.2626,1.1302,1.7267,0.9109,3.3351,4.0292,2.0562,2.458,0.7409,1.2832,0.0034,0.334,3.3641,0.0071,0.8399,4.7055,0.1034,8.154,2.1526,3.8445,0.1417,5.4513,5.5348,0.2625,0.6993,0.3976,1.7078,5.5134,1.3303,3.7501,3.5276,0.0009,4.1733,5.2921,3.857,3.6751,4.177,1.4008,4.2752,0.4334,5.9707,2.5301,0.956,7.4276,2.3161,3.4926,6.1845,5.6604,3.9475,1.2726,0.004,0.7836,1.146,0.9165,1.2844,1.9196,1.228,1.6717,2.5583,0.6662,0.8458,5.7175,1.2346,3.4561,0.8265,4.8145,4.6148,0.7943,1.1015,0.0313,0.0017,2.0049,2.0166,2.6275,2.3957,1.5568,0.1241,2.4743,1.517,1.1017,2.5837,1.7199,1.671,2.4149,2.1344,2.2884,0.3449,0.3167,2.4558,0.3059,0.1599,5.9561,1.4715,4.8183,1.8137,0.342,0.7803,2.8491,3.9394,4.098,0.152,0.7905,3.4633,13.6601,8.7012,4.7456,5.763,1.3729,2.6835,1.387,0.0118,0.0029,0.6062,3.3859,0.8581,0.0151,2.3719,4.358,3.0618,0.2903,1.1858,0.9805,2.4016,0.2447,4.6674,0.0818,0.3195,0.0771,4.6399,3.7129,1.4013,1.1421,2.547,0.5971,6.4228,4.8742,1.914,1.1052,3.3756,3.1294,7.9802,3.8921,5.6494,0.0562,3.6736,0.0004,2.1206,7.3729,1.5266,0.1113,4.5163,3.659,1.5548,3.918,0.0364,1.2011,0.4082,0.0267,0.6402,2.1571,1.6204,6.4306,0.4093,1.5177,0.0338,4.4227,5.1419,2.4911,0.4091,2.6617,2.8616,7.0421,0.0016,0.0001,2.8632,1.3749,0.2251,5.7986,5.793,0.0682,5.34,6.3015,5.2959,2.7215,2.0946,3.0813,4.933,5.7531,0.272,3.752,5.3833,8.8267,5.9245,5.5653,0.6414,1.4668,3.7804,1.9628,1.5985,7.3816,0.7173,5.3617,7.1726,1.6386,3.2002,1.506,0.0101,0.0033,2.5991,4.415,2.0837,2.046,2.0652,4.7092,2.6258,2.019,0.8625,3.5924,1.0958,3.0655,0.8802,1.4833,6.8133,0.237,4.2872,0.9435,6.6213,1.3086,6.2274,3.0989,6.7211,0.6499,9.0145,0.0528,0.0044,0.0009,5.2105,1.0456,0.9816,2.6989,3.8885,0.0438,0.5087,2.4884,7.3528,4.889,0.8039,0.0022,0.0035,0.6044,3.5277,4.7374,3.2287,5.9502,8.4469,4.4897,2.518,6.8738,6.0018,2.5505,4.1664,5.2594,7.7277,4.1196,5.5849,0.0655,1.6128,1.6789,4.4833,0.7119,0.1514,0.4596,2.7187,5.2533,1.6599,0.0026,0.0035,2.0826,4.2589,4.8241,3.8665,3.4134,1.5,0.6187,0.468,3.7869,4.1954,7.594,5.1854,1.2419,0.0011,2.7261,0.9407,1.1529,0.818,3.7573,1.4955,0.0048,0.0009,1.7693,2.2737,4.4998,5.5545,2.137,2.7608,0.0007,3.1599,2.5653,2.5915,2.6889,0.0129,0.4258,1.3789,5.2912,0.3064,2.3833,0.0652,0.0081,1.7118,0.3408,2.6792,5.4429,0.409,5.1253,2.2361,0.8563,4.6367,1.2521,4.9152,4.0741,0.9274,2.6559,3.4762,4.2712,1.7394,5.6957,0.8308,2.0952,2.3961,0.0034,0.0036,1.0972,0.8351,0.2687,6.0292,2.5556,0.3181,1.2454,0.015,0.3268,0.0852,0.7629,0.4936,1.7605,4.9215,3.1875,3.5971,1.4138,7.2101,0.5099,0.2414,3.948,0.2269,1.4528,2.5156,1.8243,4.3149,0.3122,3.9261,3.0349,0.06,2.6245,0.4176,0.8483,3.0029,1.3878,3.524,0.2531]}

Qassemi has warned against what he called an international conspiracy linking Iran and Hizbullah, and he said that Hizbullah had no relationship with Iran, which is a common claim by the Iranian regime, which maintains that Hizbullah is a proxy army for Iran.\nIran and Lebanon have long traded accusations, with Tehran calling allied with the Shiite Hezbollah militia, one of three militant organizations opposing its authoritarian government. In March the Hezbollah group began sending armored personnel carriers and heavy artillery to Lebanon, and in the summer began firing rocket fire at Israel. The group also began establishing bases in central Lebanon in what Iranian officials described as an intelligence-gathering effort to identify Israeli agents in the south of Lebanon.\nThe European Union on a deal with the Iranian government in which it has promised to work to ease Tehran s international isolation, improve human rights and halt development of nuclear weapons in Iran, and other conditions. The European Union also would give Iran access to European financial markets, and would allow access to European aircraft and shipping without permission. U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Monday the talks, which took place behind closed doors, were a first step that would begin negotiations on a deal, but could be a very lengthy and difficult process.\nQASMEE said that the talks revealed that the EU has more than enough leverage to force Iran to change its behavior and he repeated the warning that Iran was willing to use force in Lebanon.\nThe UN Security Council unanimously passed four resolutions against Iran in February and March last year, and condemned the nuclear program and called for sanctions if the program continued.\nThe International Monetary Fund, which has had good relations with Tehran since the Iranian revolution, has warned that the United Nations Security Council sanctions could have a greater impact on Iran s economy than U.S. sanctions.\nQASSMEE said Monday the Iranian government wanted the Security Council to act in favor of peaceful solutions on the regional situation and he repeated what he said earlier this month.","token_len":495,"entropy":[6.6197,5.6376,1.1869,6.2313,11.0409,7.9608,2.8324,1.03,2.2579,3.2871,3.9048,2.5133,1.9946,0.1519,5.0683,2.3569,5.6801,4.0125,6.4474,3.3618,1.4357,2.2622,3.183,0.0405,1.1304,0.4844,1.9393,0.2601,0.8045,2.1218,0.8319,0.139,0.9271,3.8212,1.6603,1.4718,1.9995,0.2165,4.2134,0.0126,0.0197,5.4274,0.9951,0.7571,5.3837,2.5701,2.2969,0.0005,1.2067,0.0621,0.4141,0.0012,0.2787,2.9286,5.0375,0.1126,1.448,1.8676,6.523,1.7554,4.2127,1.542,2.9315,1.7137,7.2485,6.7464,1.5419,0.5461,7.1058,0.1376,0.5301,0.0007,8.2889,5.3729,4.6716,1.0283,2.7252,8.1134,0.515,5.1286,5.5227,4.1714,4.9043,0.9691,1.5914,4.7191,1.7171,2.0441,3.1877,0.1197,0.4022,2.542,0.0201,0.0096,5.4649,3.7897,2.1882,6.3752,0.1474,0.6937,2.3974,4.4224,3.5184,7.2531,1.1846,1.23,3.2449,0.001,0.0082,0.0018,2.2957,2.6011,3.1667,1.5437,1.6796,2.626,0.0047,0.0015,0.002,3.5406,3.1602,4.5294,0.1823,0.9053,2.0283,2.7987,1.8742,2.3888,5.5449,4.3379,1.8203,2.1883,2.577,1.2335,2.7776,3.0586,4.7643,1.5279,1.4484,0.0017,0.0007,0.0017,0.8175,1.2461,5.0117,4.5601,0.7232,2.2053,1.0988,1.7393,10.7728,3.1255,3.502,1.7061,2.6899,5.1151,2.1865,3.5713,3.3114,2.6493,4.4951,12.5315,9.7766,2.5192,4.4955,2.0212,2.7718,1.9058,7.3336,0.0802,6.0931,5.4153,3.6656,5.4079,3.7622,8.8808,2.4288,1.2795,2.808,3.4005,4.5489,4.3607,2.1414,4.7539,4.4523,5.802,1.7664,0.0058,2.0451,4.1605,1.9899,0.6946,0.877,1.2952,2.2605,1.781,3.9579,2.0828,5.4936,4.5419,4.4046,3.8778,1.0857,1.9158,1.4647,2.3425,4.1684,2.1498,3.0951,6.2303,2.8802,0.4513,7.0539,1.0221,3.2475,4.5665,5.0555,0.9554,2.6211,0.0263,1.6115,7.4351,1.6779,0.9481,0.0009,2.0868,1.6341,5.1946,5.0217,4.1888,2.919,1.4862,5.2892,1.7842,1.4823,0.7809,1.1544,2.3183,7.0374,0.1592,4.1576,7.7918,7.6641,1.2212,3.5289,1.8855,1.3883,2.4555,4.3215,1.177,3.2151,3.5042,0.5154,4.9686,2.9157,5.3287,5.6893,3.3953,5.9716,0.988,0.9449,11.279,4.9844,0.0255,0.8915,4.2776,6.5544,1.3239,3.1578,0.8628,2.566,2.7164,0.4467,3.788,5.7832,4.7648,3.689,1.7364,2.0272,0.6325,2.3184,6.377,4.4292,1.2521,4.0576,0.0234,4.7478,2.4275,1.0423,1.2046,2.1126,2.2678,2.8088,5.7501,0.1809,2.9454,6.8186,2.5648,5.4725,7.1892,6.2249,1.3812,6.6142,0.0098,4.5132,0.1679,1.528,0.0034,6.531,0.0002,1.2445,3.5431,3.0661,4.3104,4.1546,0.865,3.5067,0.0318,5.979,0.0248,0.0149,0.6405,1.4023,2.0972,4.5959,0.232,4.812,0.671,5.0552,2.3102,1.5014,1.2573,2.7506,3.0492,1.6918,4.6226,2.0108,4.3933,4.463,3.3694,3.3288,1.59,0.6842,0.3568,0.8556,5.2213,7.5671,4.3217,7.398,8.7443,1.5576,1.8028,2.3691,8.0389,1.502,1.6922,5.1215,2.6828,5.4538,1.1089,2.9311,2.1903,0.7481,3.7926,1.163,0.2724,2.459,0.2547,2.0642,1.8315,7.6744,6.7429,1.8612,3.538,1.0428,3.115,2.7976,3.3853,0.0327,3.5411,1.0954,2.6637,5.6884,1.7777,1.2875,2.2246,4.9627,0.6901,0.0014,3.1452,2.2927,7.3989,0.2084,3.2731,1.3268,1.8375,3.2101,2.7516,3.4963,4.7729,0.0868,0.8892,1.9833,7.297,1.362,3.7584,2.405,2.1885,2.7513,0.9259,4.2378,6.2081,2.1472,4.8746,1.6804,0.3471,1.648,1.8211,4.9213,4.7002,0.0004,2.3843,1.3232,1.9036,5.3387,5.3213,0.1179,0.0126,1.8225,2.0778,1.1187,4.0972,1.4176,1.3646,1.5257,3.6868,0.5049,1.6381,3.7629,3.0736,2.3556,0.0007,5.3149,2.3883,2.8386,1.1211,6.1266,0.3523,0.5559,1.267,4.6313,1.2934,1.273,5.5432,0.0018,0.648,0.5276,0.4027,1.1062,1.0887,2.9346,5.7756,7.1675,0.4496,0.9082,4.8101,2.9523,4.2873,1.1812,5.171,2.268,2.9497,0.0025,0.2786,2.6243,2.6978,4.4721,0.0137,6.2394,4.4793,4.1354,0.7897,5.8321,5.4683,1.8432,5.7062,4.3524,4.6557,1.1059,0.8542,3.856,1.7844,0.6345,2.2312]}

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump s new national security strategy unveiled this week is a criminal document that seeks the total subordination of the whole world to the interests of the U.S. , North Korea s","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump s new national security strategy unveiled this week is a criminal document that seeks the total subordination of the whole world to the interests of the U.S., North Korea s leader Kim Jong-Un and Iran. The document claims that Trump will pursue a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy against North Korea in an effort to force the U.S. out of its diplomatic stalemate with Pyongyang. The document, titled \u201cA Path to Total Nuclear disarmament,\u201d is composed of 22 pages, the full text of which was obtained by NK News. The document\u2019s author, Defense Secretary, James N. Mattis, said it is a clear articulation of Trump s foreign policy intentions.\n\u201cIt s a plan to push North Korea to the brink of collapse with a combination of sanctions, economic pressures, isolation from U.S. countries, diplomacy, and military engagement,\u201d Mattis said in an interview with NBC today. To the rest of the world, the document is \u201ca comprehensive strategic document,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt s a book of war written, and it seeks to make clear who will lose and who will win.\u201d\nThe document has already been sent to the U.N. Security Council on Friday. A U.N. official told NK News today that the security council, currently dominated by U.S. forces, will likely hold a secret meeting on the matter before any public comment. The U.N. has yet to announce what it has in mind.\nThe Pentagon has issued multiple warnings that if North Korea continues to produce advanced missiles and nuclear material, they are in danger of being able to strike the U.S. mainland. North Korea claims it has the ability to hit the entire continental U.S. But what is more worrying is the possibility that they may have acquired the technology to launch a second round of ballistic missiles at the U.S. mainland.\nThe document says that \u201cany military engagement by the United States or any coalition against North Korea would make it impossible for that country to use force, or act as a nuclear deterrent, and would increase the risk of a nuclear catastrophe.\u201d\nThe president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, has said several times he would like to see Iran and North Korea completely destroyed and his new national security strategy indicates that this is the course of action he intends to follow.","token_len":497,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,9.3009,6.7699,3.0328,0.0433,4.0534,5.4221,3.8533,0.3321,3.7722,2.3047,9.9494,6.4321,1.3565,4.1745,5.0508,6.6993,8.8458,0.0045,0.0684,1.1739,8.1457,2.1208,0.731,1.3742,3.0885,0.0193,1.0175,2.9509,0.0005,0.0051,1.9458,7.5541,0.1038,9.0842,4.6734,1.0882,0.0057,2.62,2.5412,1.6974,4.5874,1.7207,2.4003,0.7532,5.3175,0.8708,3.8688,2.4536,4.8609,1.2403,16.9284,6.5905,7.7791,3.8247,3.0123,5.9976,4.1561,2.1026,1.0516,0.0328,3.5577,3.1922,0.4487,0.0372,3.7611,1.2399,2.0463,0.0005,0.0059,0.0871,3.2295,0.0493,2.0626,5.3924,10.17,0.0034,0.5561,1.6965,0.6063,2.0057,1.0577,2.9451,2.8141,5.1813,1.2303,4.4104,5.5626,0.833,6.0206,4.1875,10.0114,0.0009,2.0946,4.1631,4.7964,2.0685,5.7455,0.1189,6.3478,2.005,1.9539,4.0656,5.5112,0.6682,0.1668,0.0154,2.1276,2.184,0.2257,4.5046,0.053,0.9801,1.4546,1.159,8.112,6.926,3.305,3.1584,1.3218,8.8629,0.5562,6.0963,1.704,7.1229,0.0988,0.0412,0.5213,2.1585,3.9651,1.6047,1.6116,4.8949,6.6355,0.0044,0.0749,2.7555,1.6702,4.836,0.0305,5.2718,1.5252,1.8504,11.6595,0.8716,4.9791,6.4426,1.5236,3.9101,1.1044,6.3176,1.7232,0.0361,1.4483,2.0131,0.2647,0.2112,3.8696,3.8778,1.6736,6.2435,0.0262,3.1623,0.8302,2.7775,5.5361,0.7587,5.5708,3.5382,3.3768,0.0009,0.014,0.0652,6.1702,0.7819,7.4231,1.0204,0.6226,2.9506,5.3455,2.4176,4.2729,3.0086,4.2786,0.6374,1.5663,1.655,0.0936,0.6665,5.3326,6.9088,0.1761,6.8774,3.7453,6.0934,0.2728,0.2527,0.1163,0.3512,1.2522,3.1429,1.7818,5.1562,0.7184,1.3491,5.165,5.7597,4.1552,3.4177,0.1886,1.5738,2.002,8.3941,0.3442,2.4612,0.1911,1.1,1.9137,0.6537,7.1208,3.1538,5.4456,5.4067,5.404,4.7131,1.6535,6.2525,0.5652,3.5971,3.4713,5.0102,2.5185,6.0058,2.0448,0.3202,0.3028,2.5525,1.8328,1.223,1.6022,1.1282,2.907,1.753,3.9181,3.4903,0.612,4.41,0.2355,1.302,1.7256,0.001,1.1559,0.222,0.8401,0.002,3.9516,3.7886,1.7666,4.0869,2.4915,0.0006,0.6585,0.0359,2.6377,1.6725,1.2906,0.0312,3.8093,0.2502,0.7297,6.8988,0.0976,4.1308,5.6005,4.6193,0.0117,4.3899,0.0006,0.1684,0.3761,5.3678,0.3609,1.2929,4.7244,3.4345,0.8497,5.4604,0.685,1.0616,1.5292,3.0343,4.2726,5.1681,5.3367,2.1756,2.1735,1.7227,2.0243,0.0007,0.2956,0.1151,3.007,3.846,0.002,4.0823,3.4589,2.6421,4.2492,3.0047,0.4971,1.7891,0.5228,2.2928,5.5949,1.6031,4.1836,5.1158,1.2617,2.4058,4.0936,1.2773,0.021,2.2039,0.3868,5.1424,5.5413,3.8905,2.0886,1.2335,4.5292,0.5583,2.9764,3.2624,3.4895,1.639,0.0799,1.4571,5.4434,0.0051,3.0351,0.5017,0.3391,0.0007,0.0107,0.217,0.685,0.6799,3.4823,0.0999,4.7054,2.1268,1.011,3.0007,1.5609,0.0499,3.4355,0.4921,5.5324,1.5932,0.3173,0.0006,0.0019,0.4843,5.15,5.0328,2.0231,3.53,3.2532,0.4402,1.8112,3.4443,0.421,4.0753,1.7494,2.8465,6.5483,2.1442,1.9623,1.3081,2.7783,1.7242,5.6223,5.096,0.0357,2.1851,0.6099,3.0999,0.8418,0.4172,0.0007,0.0029,0.1998,0.1365,0.5661,0.7388,1.9646,2.2064,3.8702,0.5562,4.5778,0.18,6.1517,3.7691,5.3564,3.7108,1.437,1.6983,0.0055,2.1692,1.1223,6.2181,2.7414,0.4211,0.0175,3.0199,5.9865,0.9143,2.0419,0.3409,5.5337,0.8683,0.3735,4.607,3.8687,2.913,4.4444,6.3684,1.9218,0.3537,3.2715,2.1972,0.9711,4.4872,1.4251,4.9524,0.5889,1.0667,0.3364,1.7865,0.8468,5.076,1.0611,2.0011,1.5014,0.5229,1.6757,6.5683,2.9888,0.4246,0.5922,0.1275,0.9777,2.1154,0.781,0.001,0.0026,0.2723,1.839,2.8792,6.7842,0.0028,3.4164,1.3257,3.2559,0.17,1.2394,5.1962,2.2111,0.9364,0.0027,4.5715,3.7579,2.5057,5.5303,4.8931,1.807,0.0241,0.1761,5.63,0.5428,2.7967,1.3604,1.8597,5.2904,2.3219,0.1519,2.6164,1.6066,0.1279,1.1853,0.3596]}

As of mid-July, he received positive ratings in several key polls, including from the White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, from a group of Democratic lawmakers known as the Progressive Caucus, and from a group of Republican congressional leaders known as the Republican Study Committee.\nAccording to Politico, a survey this month that polled 1,000 registered voters revealed that only a small portion \u2014 10 percent \u2014 had ever heard of Trump. But nearly half \u2014 46 percent \u2014 of Democratic voters surveyed had heard of him and a little less than a third \u2014 33 percent \u2014 said they had heard of Trump from a news source like Fox News, which Trump has frequently attacked as a biased media outlet.\nEven among Republicans, Trump was rated unfavorably by more than a third \u2014 35 percent \u2014 of those polled compared with 32 percent rating Clinton favorable, a figure based on two polls.\nEven Democrats who have condemned Trump\u2019s support for the wall agreed he was unlikely to achieve it, said Jessica Riem, a professor of political science at Arizona State University in Tempe who conducted a survey of the views of a dozen Democratic state legislators in 2017.\nBy mid-May, however, Republicans had managed to get Trump to agree to pass a bipartisan bill to restore funding for a government agency known as Citizens United that was disbanded by a court order in 2010. It will be considered by the Senate this week to end the political crisis and bring some normalcy to Washington in the short term.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a lot more able to get together bipartisanship than he is to deal with impeachment or any other Republican effort,\u201d said Tom Emmer, the president of the conservative Brookings Institution, a think tank.","token_len":498,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,11.7229,8.1086,7.4978,8.8295,2.0525,1.5437,6.5742,2.6733,2.5547,2.5978,7.8495,3.1129,1.3528,8.0721,5.2978,6.2587,6.2435,3.3103,1.1035,5.2656,8.4807,5.6234,10.2211,2.2568,3.1898,0.7697,3.7777,2.0764,8.5015,0.0108,5.9926,0.3794,7.8242,5.1601,6.6962,2.0294,1.4825,4.9194,4.4882,2.6483,0.0028,7.7182,4.1689,0.418,0.849,15.9143,5.8998,9.9978,3.9786,6.4294,8.851,3.0561,1.0518,2.1795,5.7168,1.587,4.4252,1.1583,1.6495,2.0218,5.6277,5.9279,4.5843,2.6508,1.2148,6.9635,7.9379,4.9415,3.3953,7.1124,2.7058,0.0001,1.5169,4.8947,0.0548,1.7283,1.9699,2.0254,0.6695,4.3842,0.8974,0.9201,1.7043,4.0834,3.6884,0.7686,1.8203,5.2678,6.0019,0.2554,2.9473,1.4893,5.1906,7.0435,1.5461,1.0578,4.8855,5.7833,0.1372,2.4673,4.2826,6.191,0.3307,2.7384,4.9212,5.6375,0.0036,1.5897,2.7658,6.7784,2.0033,1.8919,2.7087,0.0014,2.0846,7.4319,0.1828,3.511,0.454,0.1938,0.2538,0.24,1.1759,1.3535,0.9695,3.6275,0.2346,4.796,2.9731,0.2432,1.0873,1.0972,9.3173,3.1358,2.0443,6.0246,4.1413,0.61,2.743,2.9084,5.2498,0.0434,6.5551,5.1248,2.5284,0.0017,6.1992,0.1683,2.3801,3.9909,2.0777,3.3093,0.0851,2.623,0.1083,2.7701,3.7337,8.5772,2.659,3.472,5.7147,1.7741,3.0038,1.1553,0.7124,2.5596,2.2272,6.5561,0.0016,3.4858,1.6344,2.0851,1.8418,1.1,5.2974,2.3903,2.685,0.7425,3.3398,2.6364,4.7171,0.2214,0.3674,5.2819,0.4355,0.9922,0.4664,0.1243,1.9916,0.9429,0.2602,2.243,4.5822,0.4698,0.9189,0.0124,0.1171,3.1276,1.5248,0.0289,0.4214,0.5327,5.775,0.0055,3.3196,0.506,3.1028,4.0135,5.4011,1.9324,6.4824,4.6019,1.2457,0.0154,1.8051,2.3139,0.1217,4.5045,0.4621,3.5826,3.6029,1.7234,2.308,4.3338,5.5722,0.1908,0.0653,3.6313,4.2358,2.0075,0.2591,1.297,1.6322,3.1956,5.7463,1.3253,2.8953,2.788,0.0131,0.0197,1.9476,4.3126,1.4509,3.6483,1.1819,0.6354,0.2318,1.0524,3.4841,3.331,4.0916,1.9197,0.0138,1.7165,0.5877,1.48,3.764,0.0058,0.0142,3.0543,0.5184,0.5527,0.795,0.2062,2.5392,4.5613,1.2137,5.3394,0.9988,5.1281,3.1541,0.0535,2.547,2.5131,3.8693,1.3412,3.5854,3.4188,1.8559,1.1541,3.9211,1.5672,0.9383,0.2762,0.2895,3.8642,2.6598,1.51,0.6356,1.4165,4.2919,4.159,5.5824,0.0041,0.0,0.2638,3.9531,0.192,2.2754,0.5539,3.6114,3.5451,0.0157,0.2343,0.894,2.6077,1.1744,6.6033,0.9529,4.5012,0.0052,8.2217,3.2002,9.2327,2.181,3.2932,2.9378,6.3884,0.1395,4.6792,1.6179,3.4932,0.7261,3.7849,5.939,1.7494,2.0521,7.9297,0.3796,10.0565,1.0524,0.6269,4.2589,1.7809,1.6179,4.2764,6.7851,3.5831,1.7159,5.337,0.0114,3.6745,3.2161,1.5223,4.2713,6.6498,4.2286,7.2217,3.6782,0.7098,3.5136,0.454,0.8571,0.0173,0.0789,5.5829,0.0025,0.0048,3.336,0.2883,0.0001,2.6255,2.5353,1.794,1.9164,1.03,3.014,5.2326,0.0542,3.9078,4.8044,1.2227,4.5086,1.6785,2.1505,5.5395,0.2571,0.4317,6.0246,5.3689,0.0224,4.2615,0.0497,3.6631,0.002,3.6015,0.7898,5.8454,0.0472,3.0749,3.5406,0.8009,2.6878,0.3149,6.5037,0.7581,2.9532,2.0924,1.1544,5.4118,0.944,0.638,3.1278,3.2224,2.8846,4.7046,0.0777,9.0277,0.0196,1.8103,3.0486,7.3227,2.1102,2.0693,2.2562,2.8114,1.3905,2.8533,0.6011,3.9219,4.6632,1.9177,5.5021,1.0998,0.7317,0.8649,2.3368,0.873,3.2022,4.4826,0.8663,4.5791,6.0929,2.8901,4.4907,3.9222,6.7234,0.8281,0.7969,3.117,4.8574,0.9114,3.3216,0.2143,0.4688,0.4001,3.4559,0.6794,6.1264,6.5722,1.1113,0.0937,3.0478,5.6407,1.5722,5.9927,0.6674,3.1827,7.0851,9.1347,0.0038,0.0,0.0025,1.8565,1.9042,1.4391,1.9384,3.8395,0.0637,7.789,2.7577,3.1088,0.4319,6.9265,4.0653,3.1434,2.218,1.0549,0.5616,5.1183,8.201,0.1823,1.0278,3.1126,2.3585,0.1436,0.3714,3.1213,5.6341,0.0112,1.7723,1.5441,1.4675,0.0284,1.2506]}

Two other Australians and a Filipino man were taken by the fishermen in an inflatable raft to the coast at Barangay Kalanang, which is not far from the tourist port city of Legazpi City. The trio were in their 38-foot yacht, which capsized at 4 p.m. local time on Sunday. No more than ten metres of seawater came through the hull of the boat. The survivors were rescued by a vessel of the Philippine Coast Guard, which reported them immediately to the local police. Police told The Manila Times they were in the process of sending them to a medical facility when one of the two men died on Monday afternoon. The survivors are understood to have no major injuries. But one man suffered frostbite to his hand and leg, police said. The vessel was on way to Legazpi City following a charter that it issued to a Chinese fishing company. The boat was carrying three other Filipinos - a passenger and two crew members. Photo: AP Photo \/ Elza PaezThe three Australians rescued, including the fatality. (AFP photo)Source: AP\nThe Philippines is set to ban the export sale, import and manufacture of all plastic straws and similar pieces of plastic, an official revealed Wednesday. A directive signed by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, which took effect Tuesday, is aimed at the environmentally-destructive and ubiquitous single-use straws plaguing Filipino beaches, rivers and oceans. One study in 2012, carried out by the Philippines s National Environmental Management Agency, revealed that over 30,000 plastic straws are discarded daily by Filipino workers on beaches - with the same amount being flushed down the toilet.

A new deal to rein in greenhouse gas emissions is near completion but a few key issues remain unresolved, including the fate of developing countries. President Rodrigo Duterte will address the UN Security Council on climate issues on May 14 and 15. In November, his government urged the United Nations to postpone its climate talks amid the coronavirus pandemic - calling for a climate summit to be hosted online, in order to keep participants connected in person.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday urged warring parties in Yemen to stop all ground and air assaults and called for a resumption of all commercial imports into the country because millions of children, who are in urgent need of health aid, are facing starvation.\nGuterres told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett \u201cWe have now surpassed 20,000 people killed (since March 2015), including more than 5,000 women and children, and more than 250,000 internally displaced people who have fled the worst violence.\u201d\nIn Yemen, some 2.1 million people in a country of 16 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, he said, adding that that has \u201ccompletely decimated all healthcare services, leading many hospitals to cease functioning and more than half the country is subject to chronic conflict and restrictions on humanitarian activity.\u201d\n\u201cThe most dire humanitarian crisis in the world today,\u201d he said, adding that UN agencies in the country had assessed a yearlong hunger crisis, with nearly 13 million people needing food assistance.\n\u201cThese are the numbers of those who are dying in Yemen each week,\u201d he added, saying that in some areas in the country, such as Saada, \u201cthe level of suffering is so pervasive, such that the daily lives of people are not only destroyed by the crisis, but by what that implies for their sense of dignity.\u201d\nOn July 20, the U.N. reported that some 900,000 children in Yemen are at risk for acute malnutrition, with more than 800,000 children suffering from acute and chronic malnutrition. As many as 600,000 children, who suffer from acute and chronic malnutrition, are in urgent need of food assistance in Yemen.\nUN agencies have seen a resurgence of violence and conflict in Yemen since the fall of Omar al-Bashir\u2019s government in the spring of 2019, which has led to a humanitarian crisis.\nUN agencies estimate that more than 60,000 civilians have been killed since 2015 as a result of the war and conflict in Yemen, including almost 29,000 people since March 2020 alone.\nYemen\u2019s two major tribes, Shia and Sunnis, are fighting each other over power and control of the country. The central government under the control of Saudi-supported military and coalition forces was installed in July 2015 to defend the country against forces including Iran-backed rebels and the Houthi movement.","token_len":501,"entropy":[2.2815,3.9682,0.2847,4.9211,0.5396,0.0063,3.3548,0.0065,0.0007,0.0009,3.2594,2.3744,3.2373,8.281,1.326,0.9146,2.1186,4.8028,0.1628,2.6723,4.8052,7.6212,3.4804,0.6197,5.2967,2.548,4.8427,0.7655,1.6301,4.6788,0.0277,0.0349,3.9568,7.0876,8.2165,3.2486,0.4192,0.1782,6.1724,8.9981,0.2337,5.0691,3.7056,3.7824,1.2801,3.7647,3.9486,0.0226,0.4043,4.1279,4.6582,0.2986,0.7541,3.922,1.4348,0.7326,0.1989,17.3129,0.0037,0.0003,3.006,5.2177,16.3111,10.982,5.0788,4.3928,0.004,5.7064,7.0852,12.0815,2.4589,6.3009,6.814,4.4586,1.8905,0.0123,2.0937,3.7113,6.3306,4.471,2.7014,2.9344,1.6503,3.6546,2.5409,0.0152,3.5508,0.3695,0.2748,3.9287,0.4334,0.2764,1.3982,1.3477,1.9027,0.0246,4.9819,0.2582,0.0015,4.3398,0.0007,0.7408,3.4209,1.0872,0.5159,2.047,7.5012,2.6582,4.0992,3.2911,7.4671,0.7336,3.428,3.0821,0.294,4.9517,3.2855,0.8179,2.9355,0.0216,0.4032,3.9272,3.7157,1.9143,2.2045,5.0093,0.2494,0.4577,1.7176,2.4879,0.6189,0.0269,0.6638,0.6962,0.8993,5.5264,0.1556,1.3325,2.0129,0.2898,5.4933,4.2606,13.3085,3.2141,7.6142,5.8327,0.0127,5.4184,8.4854,2.3189,1.9027,5.9847,3.375,5.5347,0.548,5.4522,3.1123,2.0355,4.8518,0.2354,2.956,3.0073,1.2562,2.3362,5.8056,0.0063,5.1605,6.1625,3.193,7.9201,0.6846,2.7342,4.7804,0.219,2.7304,0.7001,0.2112,4.3431,2.1082,2.3054,5.5409,5.0286,1.1586,1.259,0.9895,1.0475,1.4284,3.3135,2.3114,5.3932,1.9714,1.5392,0.2969,0.1788,8.7055,0.2528,6.4568,3.8081,3.4072,1.8097,1.1754,2.7206,5.7528,3.0646,7.1226,4.0522,5.1403,2.73,2.7273,2.3843,3.4121,5.0638,0.84,0.2419,5.0387,1.4224,1.1986,0.9385,0.7062,1.8885,0.8596,6.037,1.4448,1.3047,3.6628,1.4969,3.6231,1.2168,1.1259,4.0783,2.1043,1.2867,5.6343,3.6121,1.1603,0.2124,0.8184,0.7863,2.3044,1.2694,3.3155,0.979,3.8705,3.5801,1.7918,4.4128,0.5307,0.2535,0.8932,3.8129,0.0051,5.7534,0.1425,0.8417,5.3917,0.2114,2.7142,5.13,0.075,4.2382,1.317,2.5841,7.6388,2.5613,5.8576,1.2254,2.2965,6.4711,3.0579,0.1371,2.5863,1.4262,3.581,3.7438,6.3865,2.8198,2.0187,7.7933,0.5117,0.1509,2.8132,5.3722,6.7146,7.7604,1.1841,1.889,6.7586,0.0038,2.6251,1.512,1.501,0.245,0.1347,4.2652,5.8716,3.4675,0.1484,1.7231,3.2587,0.0009,0.1305,0.1292,5.1944,0.3027,5.1111,6.2512,0.4563,0.0029,2.5918,1.5378,0.7262,1.7645,2.8771,0.1122,2.7539,5.2362,0.0987,1.0489,2.0059,2.3689,0.0479,4.5866,0.0714,0.0017,1.4391,2.8895,0.3438,3.3147,3.7193,0.4274,0.7407,0.8751,5.2834,3.5953,0.0127,4.4059,0.0958,0.0009,0.7063,3.2342,3.0798,4.6886,0.2074,2.6899,0.8789,0.022,0.6464,0.3377,0.7909,2.4558,2.3247,0.0448,0.0415,2.2936,0.9292,2.9808,2.3446,0.9068,0.6942,5.2274,3.4832,1.6086,5.7532,1.435,6.0718,0.9102,2.9602,2.3358,3.2926,1.0317,0.8176,1.2452,1.1728,3.571,0.0095,8.1019,0.0433,0.0187,0.6603,0.1884,0.0271,6.3121,3.4928,5.0008,1.3175,0.461,4.3823,3.6623,0.1694,12.9106,0.9392,3.5591,1.8823,2.2778,0.1161,1.7866,2.8243,0.2635,2.1336,1.222,4.5516,2.2938,3.6698,0.1399,2.1899,0.0049,4.1985,0.4363,0.0034,1.6394,0.7269,0.2872,0.1078,2.0232,3.4767,3.8007,0.5912,0.0864,0.0032,1.2077,2.5206,2.4611,2.3908,1.5357,0.1443,0.8187,2.6284,4.5349,6.7681,0.0418,0.0754,3.6416,6.5035,0.9402,8.9831,5.1652,0.3198,0.82,6.4265,0.0022,5.4454,1.2069,0.4256,6.3378,3.2903,7.8386,1.3207,6.4807,0.2252,2.7467,0.0182,0.0888,1.5305,2.9318,2.5802,0.0052,2.6767,5.5112,1.0044,1.4421,0.9434,1.1086,1.772,1.0242,2.0384,6.1205,0.0844,6.9059,1.8263,4.831,0.0161,4.2795,1.7866,4.3471,4.5541,2.9497,5.9698,0.5389,5.0748,4.761,0.6811,3.9434,1.3403,2.2219,3.8746,0.6982,1.1611,1.6297,5.876,4.9191,3.2379,1.7451,0.2946,3.8772,1.7155,2.3155,0.3233,1.1191,2.2938,0.674]}

{"prompt":"Three Republican U.S. senators warned Thursday they would not vote for a slimmed-down Obamacare repeal bill without guarantees that the House of Representatives will go into negotiations with the Senate on the measure . The","text":"Three Republican U.S. senators warned Thursday they would not vote for a slimmed-down Obamacare repeal bill without guarantees that the House of Representatives will go into negotiations with the Senate on the measure. The senators - John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse the Nebraska Republican -- wrote to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. They said if legislation is stripped of some provisions including raising the deductible for healthcare plans and instituting new tax provisions, it will be unlikely to become law. The six Senators are expected to meet Thursday afternoon to discuss a deal with House GOP leaders. McCain, Romney, Collins and Sasse also signed on to a letter to President Barack Obama issued Thursday by a coalition of eight Republican senators warning that it would be unwise for the president to try to rush a repeal as Democrats seek to block it. \"We believe that the only way to keep the Obamacare repeal bill moving forward is the legislature taking a collaborative approach that recognizes that our interests intersect, yet conflict on many issues,\" the senators said in the letter. In contrast, five Democrats - Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Patty Murray of Washington D.C. and Bernie Sanders of Vermont - urged Obama to move ahead with a repeal without any cuts. The Democratic leaders said their vote would not prevent a repeal bill from becoming law if the House and Senate agree to work on a solution.\nIn an effort to get rid of the Obamacare law by January 2013, Republicans in the Senate have agreed to work on a compromise that would provide Americans with the option to enroll in a new exchange option.\nPresident Obama has ordered three major military strikes against targets in Afghanistan, a day after his own forces suffered a major defeat.\nThe Pentagon said Wednesday the U.S. military had struck forces responsible for a suicide attack that killed 13 U.S. soldiers and wounded 22 other Americans at Camp Bagram in Afghanistan's northern Uruzgan province. The strike was aimed at \"providing ongoing security at Camp Bagram.\"\nThe attack at a military base has become the most serious assault on American troops in Afghanistan in nearly a year, with troops in the country worried about the security of their soldiers.\nThe Pentagon said the U.S. has struck forces at several other sites in Afghanistan, but declined to name them. An earlier CNN report identified one target as a site used for planning the attack at Camp Bagram.","token_len":502,"entropy":[8.9307,5.2511,0.0291,0.003,0.005,0.2719,6.4038,3.325,2.5942,1.5009,1.6419,1.4499,0.733,1.7795,9.2964,2.4857,0.4549,0.0001,4.9594,0.4816,0.4569,3.6051,8.7211,0.7371,1.5279,3.2103,3.2812,0.0036,1.7089,6.2072,4.0807,3.0733,1.3387,1.1832,0.6913,2.1194,1.5137,2.919,0.6304,4.5319,2.6835,7.5795,3.6017,0.2982,1.1478,0.0014,0.5136,2.0312,0.0001,0.0044,0.0003,0.6991,9.5586,0.0017,0.0114,7.5241,0.3602,4.5609,0.1298,0.0001,11.0424,3.2869,0.3304,5.0063,4.4214,1.7477,2.7139,3.8935,1.7949,0.0116,0.0001,5.4757,2.4198,1.3877,4.0502,6.1153,1.8246,6.0247,0.8421,4.0004,1.5234,5.3742,6.6362,0.2475,6.1448,0.8662,7.7267,1.353,3.0002,6.6726,0.0011,2.5705,2.8701,6.0129,0.8734,2.1053,2.2393,1.6905,5.2786,0.1335,4.7086,0.0486,0.4355,2.3506,6.8903,6.4879,3.2854,2.4321,0.0182,3.1841,2.4791,2.7555,0.9619,1.1909,2.9062,3.5268,3.8234,3.6871,3.4088,0.2085,0.7296,4.9677,1.7339,5.4186,1.2093,2.3273,0.3269,0.0231,0.0001,3.0513,4.7788,2.2795,0.6852,0.7444,0.1933,2.0507,4.1967,1.3171,0.0037,6.2019,1.9161,3.2174,3.4699,3.5461,0.0641,5.5446,1.9277,0.1945,4.0701,0.6286,4.1503,1.0958,0.6958,4.5841,0.2057,1.094,1.1672,3.1544,0.1054,4.3118,0.1048,5.665,2.6025,1.1412,6.1865,7.3092,3.8907,0.2819,3.266,1.1197,0.5329,1.6398,2.1971,2.5783,0.8174,1.5852,4.2924,0.5557,0.6024,4.043,1.265,4.5988,1.5519,1.2528,3.9483,0.4228,0.316,6.4207,8.3836,3.8829,1.6398,8.7324,0.3701,2.6762,3.964,1.4277,4.4155,6.5266,8.1004,2.0829,7.1352,12.0264,5.8916,2.9449,1.8203,2.9221,1.1035,0.5022,2.4393,0.9109,0.6765,0.0435,0.4856,4.6803,5.437,0.325,5.614,2.7198,2.9879,5.2775,0.0004,0.0002,0.0,0.2613,0.0202,0.0512,0.0507,4.661,0.0003,0.0,0.0,0.0018,0.0012,0.3001,3.924,0.0001,0.0002,0.0015,0.0114,0.7859,4.3751,0.0002,0.0026,0.1302,5.4311,0.0021,0.0013,0.3939,0.012,4.971,0.0016,0.0062,0.0013,0.0541,3.7374,3.7127,0.2483,3.9534,2.296,0.4477,1.2887,1.3854,3.0262,2.7702,4.8539,2.0985,2.1181,5.0487,3.7178,1.5611,3.1467,4.9725,1.8348,2.0462,3.5882,1.946,2.3578,1.18,0.3298,1.8564,0.0066,3.7354,1.5595,1.2859,1.8904,0.0347,1.7866,0.5924,3.6769,1.8889,0.8548,4.3844,0.6984,3.3484,11.9171,2.5523,2.7567,0.0226,3.6874,5.9355,0.0013,0.6947,3.0119,3.148,4.4973,4.4936,5.8167,0.095,1.9882,2.3935,0.8427,0.8543,2.0063,4.3661,0.1185,3.2585,1.2289,0.4337,2.2905,1.945,0.6504,3.97,6.9236,0.2425,3.1306,2.663,1.0947,5.1902,0.3119,1.9694,2.2717,4.8069,7.8154,1.857,1.9662,4.3273,0.9336,1.5732,5.2119,5.6751,3.1324,7.4993,5.3438,1.2465,8.6916,0.3134,3.8762,1.2784,3.9439,7.3318,0.2987,3.3438,4.3912,4.265,5.0845,1.4668,1.2682,1.7713,3.1048,0.8483,1.9699,3.2441,1.528,2.9474,2.4918,2.3855,0.0004,0.0018,0.007,1.2932,1.6499,3.6287,8.3339,5.5942,0.0053,2.7941,3.5047,1.7234,2.5161,0.4144,4.6028,2.9221,0.0008,0.0032,0.0048,1.348,1.5972,0.8823,4.3046,3.5574,1.9167,2.868,4.7026,7.4967,0.0902,1.1272,0.2472,4.0458,2.7906,6.3249,1.5003,0.1077,0.0003,0.3093,0.5547,2.2144,2.3244,1.3928,4.3181,0.0279,3.7685,2.8728,0.3417,6.1432,3.1912,4.9984,3.8349,0.0951,0.0011,3.0944,0.6062,1.5748,2.9624,5.2655,3.9177,2.2702,0.5045,4.5758,4.2226,1.3313,2.5218,1.7804,5.1567,0.5627,2.6971,1.4874,0.6384,1.9458,2.1136,2.4771,1.358,1.8626,1.5659,1.5907,4.5725,2.8139,1.8222,1.9149,7.7381,0.6001,1.7489,3.5547,1.0559,0.7297,4.5366,1.0458,0.7357,1.5709,1.9071,0.5807,1.6409,3.0158,0.0006,0.0016,0.0054,2.4154,3.9005,5.4331,4.1352,3.3492,3.1874,3.1237,0.8698,0.8051,1.1334,2.4819,5.3286,0.043,2.6803,1.517,0.4494,6.0651,4.0348,6.878,0.1406,4.4137,3.3085,4.4156,0.761,0.9483,5.5049,4.4402,2.2817,6.2398,2.8894,1.1136,4.6929,1.0612,1.3479,0.0025,0.5245]}

In addition, in the presence of numerous people, people are not inclined to lie,\u201d the Moscow judge concluded.\nThe ruling will not likely end Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s criminal prosecution. In a statement, his lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said he thought the prosecutor\u2019s ruling was unreasonable. Mr. Ulyukayev had said he had forgotten that he had borrowed the money and returned it after having received instruction from chief executive Igor Sechin, Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s lawyer said. However, the prosecutor\u2019s verdict, which Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s attorney did not ask for a review, can no longer be appealed and a case can be heard only once a judge ruled.\nAccording to the prosecution, Mr. Sechin\u2019s order had the effect of ordering the prosecutor to dismiss the case for lack of grounds.\nUlyukayev was detained in October after it was claimed that he tried to buy influence in the presidential election with money that he had received for consulting services from two Ukrainian firms. The charges led to the ouster of Mr. Sechin as Rosneft\u2019s chief executive officer and a series of other top executives.\nRosneft ( ROSN.MM ) said in a statement that Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s departure was due to his inability to comply with the company\u2019s new code of conduct and procedures.\nThe Kremlin on Tuesday called for the resignation of the new US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, saying his statements about corruption were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and he had no experience in the field.\n\u201cIt is important not to be surprised by the actions of our enemies, not to think the unexpected is possible in Russia, but all this requires that people like Rex Tillerson are replaced in a timely manner,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said during his Sunday interview with the news agency Itar-Tass.","token_len":502,"entropy":[8.4055,9.1734,2.2389,4.4854,0.0266,1.59,0.0815,0.0715,0.0202,0.0086,1.9378,5.3197,3.7023,7.7697,0.0117,3.5155,3.1463,2.1717,4.3744,2.0446,4.6155,1.8625,1.9543,2.91,5.4529,4.0123,8.9683,9.0116,2.2037,9.7526,1.3214,1.8794,0.3947,6.7474,1.2657,4.4865,1.6559,8.1088,0.7166,0.0,4.8701,12.0449,1.2835,2.7692,5.7286,0.2925,7.1352,2.1744,0.2005,0.0025,3.7404,1.2843,3.964,2.7132,5.8155,1.5009,3.1557,13.7406,1.1571,13.0062,4.802,7.5342,5.8841,0.011,0.0014,0.0012,0.0008,5.1772,1.7801,2.0421,0.6134,0.4342,6.0007,3.9765,2.1917,0.3195,3.1906,1.2338,1.617,7.508,3.7448,1.8625,1.2524,3.9055,0.3899,4.2133,2.7629,0.3416,1.2388,1.5312,1.5866,1.7039,4.4926,5.4265,0.4652,4.47,1.2944,6.4779,0.0154,7.2659,2.0439,0.8359,5.671,4.3482,4.1957,6.8488,0.0398,4.9847,2.0221,10.4225,6.8466,3.5672,6.2861,5.5466,5.1968,0.6121,1.2107,6.5106,4.9808,4.368,3.2733,6.1786,4.611,7.0446,0.625,3.5312,0.0196,0.0015,0.0016,0.0013,11.8498,7.1053,0.4682,3.4643,2.947,1.4386,3.1023,2.1665,1.6301,1.0431,3.3676,0.5227,4.6315,0.0401,1.8643,1.9566,0.0673,0.1929,0.0043,0.7657,2.1517,5.0778,0.8941,3.9587,10.6625,1.9259,0.117,3.2208,0.95,6.4316,0.9744,4.878,0.0023,0.7917,0.0026,0.0023,0.0024,0.0028,3.0445,3.1233,1.0594,1.9287,7.3302,2.8061,1.3034,0.7521,5.0514,1.3801,0.6142,2.3565,5.5544,0.1865,4.4973,4.3365,3.1551,7.4362,0.5507,9.0881,2.7337,1.0429,0.1211,0.0047,2.3503,3.6937,0.001,2.5947,0.0085,0.0032,0.0019,0.0021,3.5902,0.0388,0.0172,0.9198,0.9072,0.2606,5.3872,0.0029,1.6175,2.3039,2.3616,0.0075,0.0225,4.5135,3.2632,1.4407,4.5031,0.001,0.6402,0.0025,0.0018,0.0018,0.0013,2.5683,0.0047,0.0197,3.2946,4.5646,0.0143,5.4565,0.5408,4.0219,4.0942,0.9714,5.7646,4.7122,0.0067,0.1907,1.3867,3.6928,3.7958,3.3913,2.2491,1.1077,2.9037,5.0797,2.2965,1.6129,3.0626,7.3693,2.9722,0.7296,4.9277,0.0049,1.2968,5.7903,0.4003,0.9617,0.0015,1.211,0.0006,2.6003,0.0215,0.0264,5.29,3.9015,4.1705,0.8001,0.0144,5.281,1.408,6.539,0.168,7.2344,1.1941,0.5374,4.1737,1.7619,0.001,7.0126,0.9146,1.9194,4.065,0.58,0.0106,0.0023,0.0035,2.7806,4.6605,1.4311,4.29,3.0255,4.8428,0.7029,4.9818,0.7335,0.6561,5.5011,0.0344,2.6977,7.4962,1.7684,1.2003,4.5696,0.5526,3.9609,2.9833,3.3498,1.1261,1.0713,1.8356,5.1185,5.6602,2.8939,1.4232,5.6107,4.5718,3.9858,0.6839,1.7764,3.6837,5.0105,0.3193,1.5129,4.2272,0.3408,0.0452,0.9838,0.0017,0.4386,0.0004,1.9872,6.2674,0.0069,0.0083,8.563,0.1776,0.0204,2.6121,0.2537,5.6955,1.7029,2.8246,3.9825,0.0004,3.3959,4.5147,1.2998,0.7809,1.0749,4.2393,0.0168,0.0047,4.202,1.3806,0.029,0.0203,0.0386,0.0885,3.5619,1.3832,0.2317,0.0638,0.7449,1.0508,0.0026,0.9356,0.0023,0.0022,0.0024,0.0015,2.9265,0.0097,0.0131,5.4016,1.2328,2.2697,0.0416,2.5589,3.9296,0.0111,3.7131,0.0124,1.0962,4.2725,5.2977,0.0293,0.0456,5.0474,5.9927,0.1298,0.2281,2.0524,4.5844,0.6982,0.9943,2.0324,4.1781,3.8897,2.1302,3.779,1.5966,2.1341,3.4409,0.0281,2.2197,4.403,8.3694,3.4507,0.0132,0.0603,0.7363,1.9493,0.0066,0.4862,4.2619,3.4476,6.2839,2.9176,5.047,1.6893,14.306,1.646,4.1296,2.451,0.6918,4.0268,1.5188,3.9083,2.0746,3.0681,5.8834,0.5507,1.6224,3.2616,0.4444,0.7087,4.177,0.805,4.6691,0.6038,2.9044,5.2165,0.0344,3.7774,3.4542,1.1664,1.313,4.5518,0.129,4.0358,5.5442,1.8213,5.3716,1.0679,2.679,4.1864,9.1718,2.8791,4.3661,3.7269,2.347,1.4747,1.513,6.6659,3.6393,7.0277,2.8064,4.5603,4.0337,1.8934,0.3264,3.7344,3.6736,3.3076,2.1373,4.7961,0.6524,2.1572,1.6575,1.6615,4.7277,0.2544,0.0453,0.0,0.0002,0.7498,4.8778,3.1396,6.6099,3.1401,0.9015,2.1889,3.7614,0.643,8.6189,0.003,0.0017,0.0016,0.0142,0.4237]}

The Supplemental Appropriations Authorization Act of 2018 is intended to provide approximately $ 50 billion in new funding over the next three years for federal agencies to support disaster recovery, rebuild infrastructure, and provide services while rebuilding.\nThe legislation provides for increased funding for natural disaster prevention and preparedness and emergency response activities, including assistance for those who have lost insurance during the impact of Harvey. The Act will fund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice\u2019s National Response Center (NRC).\n\u201cThis bill will provide some funding for state and local governments to respond to people affected by the devastating floods and mudflows in Texas,\u201d Congresswoman Deb Haaland (DEM-OH) said at a news conference.\n\u201cWe will continue to support the federal government and the first responders who are helping millions of people who are at risk of not having access to electricity, water, and health care. They are the heroes who are keeping everyone safe during difficult times while they are battling to save lives,\u201d he added.\nThe federal government\u2019s estimated total economic impact from Harvey will range from more than $ 700 billion, excluding lost consumer income, to as much as $ 750 billion for the state of Texas. Of the $ 700 billion, more than $ 300 billion have been reported in real damages, reported Business Insider.\nTrump said during a visit to San Antonio last week that a possible $ 50 billion in aid to Texas would be announced soon.\n\u201cAnytime you have floods, there\u2019s an opportunity for federal aid \u2014 it\u2019s a great opportunity for the president to use what we call the American Rescue Plan and do some good as the president,\u201d he said.","token_len":502,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,2.7004,5.412,5.1767,3.893,0.004,0.212,13.0367,0.5365,1.2114,2.0615,0.6622,5.4794,0.3013,4.1664,0.8783,0.961,7.4289,3.8784,1.0769,0.0372,0.6033,1.4147,7.1594,7.0637,2.7277,1.0085,5.3294,1.5071,4.0683,1.6902,7.4018,4.4781,6.0816,4.5613,0.0155,1.2035,3.2188,0.2558,0.8959,0.0162,2.7357,0.2932,0.3214,20.743,0.1503,4.0783,3.773,1.1552,3.5432,0.2421,0.479,2.3007,4.8307,6.9128,0.723,1.6637,0.2931,1.1982,6.9987,1.2572,1.5091,2.558,2.7094,6.3272,1.5096,0.0008,0.0112,0.7733,3.6783,1.0553,0.2404,0.8601,0.5262,11.3177,5.5948,2.4082,2.221,2.5728,0.0054,2.0848,7.0377,0.2339,3.9475,1.7838,2.1095,2.1446,1.6057,3.3721,0.8461,3.8294,6.3177,0.1326,1.3255,0.3316,2.7546,2.0504,3.1083,6.5311,4.8099,0.6605,1.8398,1.0663,0.5224,1.6884,5.2482,2.1446,0.0047,3.2955,3.17,6.8356,3.5867,0.1685,2.3404,1.8595,1.1511,5.5963,0.4316,4.0901,4.0006,1.8443,6.0114,1.5111,2.8376,0.347,15.6013,7.6205,5.9552,3.4037,5.0779,2.2651,2.6588,0.0427,7.2638,0.5259,1.8132,7.5998,0.8645,7.5898,0.717,2.2026,2.6941,2.0466,4.3039,0.0598,1.5274,7.5312,0.0661,3.8555,0.0505,1.4034,5.0451,0.7875,3.0886,1.0433,0.1519,2.0363,0.0996,2.4754,2.2798,2.3668,2.2111,3.6212,2.2281,1.7522,3.1149,5.2028,2.3297,0.9325,0.6273,2.0765,4.5989,5.7035,3.9913,3.2422,0.3071,1.4133,4.6455,3.9316,1.9495,5.2389,0.8832,0.4979,7.8988,0.7688,5.4242,1.0712,5.8818,0.0001,2.7182,4.6559,0.5279,4.7365,1.1933,1.3726,4.2867,1.0169,4.5131,2.2145,1.7631,1.4215,9.1614,5.8551,1.0047,6.2505,0.2712,2.5604,0.8829,2.0633,5.6141,4.5284,5.3133,2.0111,4.5803,0.0094,0.0783,0.0012,0.3837,0.006,2.497,0.0004,0.9281,1.1988,1.706,0.0015,2.503,0.7753,1.313,1.0486,0.0008,0.5042,0.0003,0.3418,0.7122,0.7086,1.1256,0.001,2.3401,4.6003,0.5236,0.1171,3.1714,3.1527,2.5518,2.0234,0.5184,0.1831,0.5133,0.4049,4.9947,6.5539,6.8672,3.2653,2.498,1.5191,6.3529,2.7301,0.5806,4.833,0.3633,0.034,1.9186,0.7668,3.3831,0.0923,7.6378,1.6763,0.0508,1.6893,3.7657,4.1294,1.6319,4.3964,6.4227,1.6314,1.2472,1.3725,9.2417,7.2016,9.0884,3.7299,7.4904,12.2624,6.3908,5.6346,1.6107,7.6872,1.3471,4.9942,0.6101,0.5589,1.9229,0.3674,0.3311,0.0162,2.0322,0.4086,2.6289,0.4777,5.0171,1.8523,1.438,0.2441,2.6193,1.5614,2.5234,0.2247,2.5341,1.8583,6.8344,0.0537,1.4936,1.0766,4.1023,6.9114,0.2094,1.691,2.9712,1.0328,3.9023,0.195,0.9268,6.0216,2.0608,1.6707,0.0178,4.9863,1.1107,0.4258,0.3309,1.5093,3.8573,0.0454,1.1768,5.7995,1.0985,1.8268,5.4088,2.428,2.0066,4.8268,4.489,0.0459,4.8916,6.7223,0.0548,6.1132,2.9295,1.7588,3.935,3.1191,2.8048,0.8022,2.7158,0.6607,0.9485,4.9584,1.3434,0.0463,0.1403,1.8116,3.7585,0.1196,5.1504,0.2158,0.0324,6.9041,3.0482,5.6885,0.7259,1.765,0.704,2.0465,3.5201,0.1664,4.926,0.012,0.0235,6.2188,0.4086,3.3168,6.9613,5.5818,6.8382,3.7053,1.3896,0.2652,2.9415,0.0542,0.0077,0.0697,5.3539,0.009,2.844,2.0413,2.4151,0.8041,0.0613,1.1385,5.9622,1.6437,1.4972,2.7309,0.0211,0.8213,2.7386,0.0133,0.6566,3.8891,0.0304,7.1176,0.7795,5.6425,2.699,6.4214,6.5552,1.3689,6.8186,11.0727,0.2165,0.8636,0.3003,5.0184,2.3826,3.3262,1.1963,4.5629,0.2089,4.8067,0.7041,2.63,0.4121,0.2088,4.5443,6.1602,2.6443,2.7715,0.0895,3.0191,2.3327,2.7476,2.0378,1.5791,0.6273,5.5731,3.5312,0.4706,0.6132,2.6205,0.5134,7.0117,6.0147,1.4918,1.9374,7.2161,1.2142,3.4495,9.4611,1.6179,0.0375,3.2108,1.1399,1.1249,3.0503,2.6189,5.8686,4.3308,1.4483,0.5823,0.0187,2.1858,3.5848,1.1772,1.1988,1.8666,4.5979,0.7868,3.6494,5.5229,2.6602,6.821,1.5928,4.0942,8.9953,6.8218,3.0592,5.0433,3.2865,2.264,5.2768,3.4562,3.563,4.0099,3.4958,0.7609,2.304,0.2944,0.3333]}

The Myanmar delegation also visited Rohingya camps around Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh and one of the largest refugee cities in the world.\nThe United Nations has pushed to bring the situation of the Rohingya to Obama's attention, saying Monday that it plans to \"bring this humanitarian crisis to the attention of the international community during his State of the Union address.\"\nThe Rohingya, who have been victims of a decades-old campaign of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar that is now seen by rights advocates, activists and other countries as a form of genocide, have fled to Bangladesh in recent days. And while Myanmar and Bangladesh are in the process of moving refugees home, that is not happening at a pace enough to stem further outflows.\nThe Obama administration on Tuesday announced that a U.S. advisory team would begin discussions with both sides and with the World Bank to help secure solutions for the Rohingya crisis.\nThe U.S. State Department said the advisory team would convene with the Myanmar and Bangladesh government to assess progress on the Rohingya crisis. That assessment could lead to an increased effort to assist refugees in Myanmar and help those who are forcibly returned to Myanmar, officials said. A U.S. representative on Monday said the Obama administration had spoken to the Myanmar and Bangladesh leaders.\n\"There will be a follow-up with the World Bank through the United States Office for South and Central Asian Affairs and Myanmar on a potential joint assistance project,\" said the representative in an interview on South America 1 with AFP, without elaborating on what kind of assistance could be considered.\nThe U.N. said Monday that between 1.5 million and 2.2 million Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar since the violence began.","token_len":503,"entropy":[11.1502,8.5982,8.8256,0.3817,6.3937,1.7922,7.5557,0.1473,5.4297,2.0257,0.8886,0.2122,4.2316,0.2342,3.3416,6.0466,5.7278,1.9152,1.5684,4.0389,8.8238,3.4687,6.405,3.2469,1.4641,0.193,2.2777,1.3556,5.2049,0.8319,1.8083,2.3672,1.828,5.9446,2.3747,0.008,0.2949,0.0142,1.1897,5.6104,3.004,4.7093,6.6624,5.3857,4.9903,6.0912,5.4737,0.7932,2.6355,0.1582,0.1862,16.3643,2.1631,5.1613,0.0289,5.5721,1.5815,4.4632,0.35,3.6337,2.2475,0.0012,2.405,0.6196,3.0391,2.8575,0.7549,2.9463,4.956,3.2302,2.8636,4.2259,0.0929,3.3244,5.1043,1.0981,4.8411,2.6467,5.7466,0.8479,2.2758,6.4358,0.6079,4.4489,2.2181,5.429,0.4926,3.133,2.6753,5.36,2.2966,5.5621,0.0409,0.4886,11.7409,0.6442,0.2295,0.038,3.7231,1.8514,0.1655,2.8447,3.5543,2.9803,6.6741,0.1498,0.0002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0971,2.8513,1.7045,7.1446,0.0059,0.568,4.7409,1.9471,0.0818,0.0989,0.0269,4.8336,4.7648,4.6621,4.4218,4.3682,2.6529,1.7914,0.633,0.1202,3.7381,5.7614,4.5191,2.4254,1.4913,0.39,4.3332,9.1367,0.0147,0.4423,0.0232,3.2259,0.1449,1.9648,2.6605,3.6276,0.5516,5.1797,0.0001,0.0,1.7267,6.6212,7.7255,0.1929,4.5744,1.9648,3.7808,3.8778,2.3018,1.6051,2.7172,3.6747,4.0991,1.8601,2.6499,5.7694,5.5213,5.7996,4.4978,0.0004,0.8801,2.5266,1.819,1.0393,0.5871,3.211,3.9085,0.0359,0.3101,3.4038,1.6035,6.1376,0.2596,0.6223,0.6865,0.3869,0.1609,1.7324,2.5189,1.0972,2.1159,6.5712,2.7428,3.1615,1.4509,3.6349,2.7361,0.7526,0.9999,0.9479,9.1252,0.094,0.175,1.0176,1.987,7.802,0.5919,2.0099,5.3786,0.0489,4.6594,5.2418,3.9361,4.2899,0.3407,0.3368,0.9,1.383,0.0957,0.8246,1.1995,0.0055,7.1199,3.7873,3.9098,0.0226,0.0012,0.0434,0.0785,0.9915,0.38,1.5568,4.8664,2.5134,1.1892,1.5687,0.9467,7.218,0.0138,2.5021,1.9406,0.0769,1.8227,3.5691,0.7286,0.5014,0.1152,3.252,1.1946,2.9456,3.7967,2.8813,3.7685,1.6551,5.2329,3.0754,5.2493,6.2005,0.2051,3.5967,5.0081,0.1031,0.7019,4.8573,0.0009,2.2132,0.4683,1.3118,3.8297,1.597,0.2058,2.3389,0.9522,2.4766,2.127,6.0676,3.2846,3.3806,2.7476,1.1273,2.1357,3.3895,1.9733,0.463,0.0017,4.3647,3.7807,5.2878,0.4149,6.1157,2.8075,1.4524,4.298,3.1265,2.3407,2.6638,8.3322,0.2039,5.2802,5.6857,7.775,1.6697,1.0168,0.2565,1.6498,3.8835,0.1594,3.6645,0.3963,3.5693,1.4066,3.3833,2.7254,0.0005,0.9001,0.2868,6.1466,2.2298,1.7831,3.6556,6.2256,0.7938,5.0363,1.867,4.1066,4.702,1.4036,5.4283,0.1457,1.5548,2.1948,4.4755,6.7093,1.8433,0.4718,1.649,1.5345,0.4903,0.672,1.4685,1.8894,0.0005,0.4883,0.0995,2.672,0.005,1.2648,2.0497,5.364,0.3374,1.5158,5.3601,0.0,3.1666,1.6565,2.3327,3.7977,0.1488,2.5343,2.041,4.1603,4.158,1.2194,1.161,3.0054,0.7815,1.4948,5.2881,6.2355,2.842,4.7565,0.1194,2.9189,6.2218,3.2951,0.6054,3.9578,3.8034,1.7606,2.5265,1.2551,5.137,4.8303,2.0623,1.1865,7.192,2.3644,0.3825,1.4914,1.5198,3.2523,0.183,0.19,5.4073,1.2667,0.0003,0.2507,0.0599,4.2784,3.7241,2.4682,1.4243,1.0294,4.8657,0.1481,2.4292,4.3854,1.0653,1.495,1.2018,1.9429,0.0282,4.6416,2.9847,0.2093,2.2337,3.4466,3.1911,0.163,1.7167,7.0566,0.135,0.065,4.304,0.6056,2.7351,0.0007,6.5724,1.1767,2.8596,2.7638,4.5904,4.0709,8.3708,1.053,0.6874,2.274,0.0439,1.8135,5.0805,3.696,2.5046,5.4828,4.6086,3.857,4.4149,1.598,1.7594,2.6089,1.6871,4.1006,2.1178,3.2561,3.32,7.6107,4.4092,8.8099,5.2685,4.7781,2.5101,5.8233,1.2023,0.0079,1.8171,1.7768,4.4744,0.0992,0.6375,3.3688,0.1614,5.0711,0.2253,0.252,1.2016,1.4939,0.0005,1.9341,0.1229,3.174,2.9069,0.4029,6.3975,2.6214,2.1317,1.1136,0.1678,0.1419,0.7191,0.5131,2.9027,0.0047,6.9117,0.4222,1.7465,0.7247,1.8065,1.7304,1.2709,3.3316,1.077,2.8362]}

The latest charges filed against Figari, are related to the abuse of minors in the elite Catholic Society.\nAsked about the current investigation and what he would say to a child abused in the organization who was in the custody of the elite Catholic Society and then was exposed as a member of the group who was part of the abuse, he said, \"So we have to consider all possibilities as part of an investigation.\nThe police and the prosecution have been seeking evidence at the residence of the former chief of the organization who was sentenced to a prison term for child sex abuse 20 years ago.\nThe police are reportedly seeking data from the organization's computer system that may implicate other priests of the religious group in child sex abuse.\nInvestigators have also told people they will not seek witnesses who claim they were abused during the abuse scandal because they are part of the group, and may fear reprisals for their involvement.","token_len":503,"entropy":[8.0825,5.8436,2.213,8.3769,2.59,3.8216,2.5825,9.9395,0.5818,0.128,1.0253,0.1278,5.8806,5.8141,15.8747,0.523,5.1779,0.1417,4.2798,6.9738,7.0923,6.7431,3.3079,2.0577,1.1399,0.1113,3.7341,6.4771,0.9074,0.3236,1.6015,3.2131,6.5113,2.8571,0.0183,0.8092,4.0292,0.5326,0.4874,20.6754,4.3606,1.8517,4.3461,3.4942,0.2793,0.0378,0.0253,4.5009,2.481,5.3913,0.4836,4.8526,1.3719,1.9746,1.5803,1.8063,1.7462,2.1299,2.1045,5.5878,2.183,3.3765,6.7618,0.4043,1.4382,4.9648,2.2518,5.2665,4.8405,0.3074,0.1673,0.1475,4.964,0.6312,2.1472,3.0164,1.504,1.3526,0.5307,5.8727,9.7717,5.5964,5.8095,0.3252,1.8002,4.054,2.3647,5.0512,0.3641,0.2442,1.4295,4.9287,0.022,1.6252,0.3959,4.6297,2.7052,2.8312,3.1434,1.7107,3.5721,2.9928,1.336,5.2902,6.3781,4.9928,3.6128,3.9934,3.4389,0.5423,5.4698,0.0113,2.9596,1.4882,2.8276,3.1964,0.7125,5.26,5.9295,0.7692,0.2221,0.9586,7.2794,4.8917,0.5012,0.2953,3.5593,6.1451,0.9348,3.4396,3.9876,2.4072,2.3907,1.7309,0.9339,0.1476,0.1192,1.5756,2.0161,1.7715,5.9105,1.2445,0.4153,0.6146,0.0044,4.1334,0.6833,1.8489,1.4628,0.1393,1.7801,3.3821,2.3888,1.7707,2.1012,1.6212,4.1782,5.5278,3.3254,0.2351,0.8489,5.5158,4.4905,0.8003,1.4624,1.5179,3.5569,1.9357,3.7661,0.4175,0.1807,5.0487,1.8919,2.8166,3.3505,0.2538,1.3432,4.0844,0.0174,2.8816,1.7531,3.4639,1.9915,3.9408,0.2439,0.3657,2.6202,4.0093,4.3237,3.7284,3.7909,0.2064,0.0302,4.7973,1.0706,2.0131,2.9971,3.4211,1.7635,3.6039,1.4252,1.7821,2.8889,2.9595,1.3465,0.1577,1.0883,0.3304,5.0037,0.4457,0.1761,3.0357,1.2682,0.2402,0.985,3.5391,0.269,5.175,6.1643,6.8956,6.3691,11.4337,5.6332,3.4327,3.3455,5.3334,5.5553,7.0754,0.0222,5.6652,1.6669,1.5439,0.4615,0.2321,4.3743,0.0239,1.9961,4.5399,0.6944,5.4896,1.4651,0.9684,2.499,0.4955,2.2052,6.6519,3.3944,5.9795,0.6709,2.749,1.2588,1.2398,1.7783,1.1625,1.6885,1.1681,2.9732,6.3718,0.331,1.3587,0.8214,3.0281,5.8254,2.2814,0.7787,2.5085,4.2888,1.1656,1.2952,1.3885,0.4737,1.5075,0.6824,5.3826,0.6326,0.1597,0.6497,2.936,0.0265,2.3928,7.2181,2.0521,5.3316,2.3919,2.9242,2.1069,0.5398,0.7732,3.5902,0.3101,2.998,0.5883,2.9499,7.7812,0.4996,1.7358,3.6952,5.9536,7.1022,0.0152,0.011,0.5309,0.8301,0.4438,3.3721,1.5286,2.485,1.4294,2.0564,1.4633,2.9999,1.4989,7.168,0.1,4.95,7.5671,0.1524,1.2864,2.6474,5.9096,2.7028,5.5094,0.7858,1.9298,0.0236,2.2485,6.6456,3.2619,0.0294,1.6609,3.2221,1.6969,2.4518,2.2797,1.1121,3.4034,0.2998,0.2469,0.8339,0.3887,6.7678,1.233,0.5149,3.6926,2.8498,4.4119,3.4768,2.4175,1.5677,1.4384,0.5953,3.974,4.5847,4.5492,2.0072,0.6647,3.6228,6.0211,2.3344,3.1809,1.1463,5.2806,0.0145,1.0437,4.5733,0.106,0.049,4.3491,4.0414,4.3573,5.0843,1.7475,0.5534,2.5348,0.9642,0.351,0.2845,5.6586,1.5193,5.0015,0.0237,0.6101,1.896,0.6701,2.5062,0.3424,1.3236,0.0237,7.1322,2.7946,2.7203,0.8271,5.2107,2.3556,2.8769,4.4703,5.5577,0.0024,4.5125,0.7058,1.6679,1.8624,3.3695,4.7847,3.4034,1.3198,4.349,1.3832,2.7494,4.6665,4.7737,4.6841,0.7585,8.827,0.3528,1.092,0.7412,4.5195,0.9094,0.1659,4.0887,3.0703,1.3944,7.8867,0.2971,3.2728,3.3365,0.2059,2.4467,3.775,1.9743,0.0674,9.1663,0.017,0.0614,0.4244,0.636,2.04,4.1026,2.464,5.7443,2.0483,6.7497,1.0763,1.107,4.3793,0.8334,3.4649,1.5637,2.1314,3.1137,7.0193,0.0002,2.9751,5.7612,4.4093,0.2709,6.8507,1.8544,2.5897,2.9749,0.5386,0.0607,0.5744,0.5486,5.5202,1.5807,1.0363,5.3374,6.281,2.3159,2.3294,3.0347,2.5367,5.1809,2.4958,4.9338,1.2501,1.6667,0.8596,3.6966,0.5765,2.6827,6.6193,4.1085,1.0247,1.9719,5.4943,0.0021,0.9497,2.0612,2.0194,2.2209,4.0283,4.8076,2.955,0.4712,0.0005,2.6958,1.3215,3.4048,0.7693]}

The bill was narrowly sponsored by Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), whose home state is suffering from health care cuts forced on it by the Republicans in the House, and in the Senate is led by the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Orrin Hatch (R-UT). A Senate filibuster to block Hatch\u2019s leadership of the legislative process has been threatened by some Democrats, including Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), but the fight between them is expected to be settled by midweek.

The warning comes on the back of earlier warnings, including the one issued by the European Medicines Agency in July, that the COVID-19 vaccine study that AstraZeneca and its investment group, the Serum Institute of India, conducted with data submitted last September was likely unreliable in some ways. The British vaccine is one of the four candidates being tested in phase 3 trials.","token_len":504,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,4.6566,2.6869,1.5785,2.4563,0.5197,1.0056,4.284,2.0517,6.4059,0.0339,0.0025,0.0019,0.1585,4.7022,5.0998,6.0664,1.2104,2.0392,0.5243,1.8986,6.2432,3.523,5.2102,3.3461,1.1021,2.0397,2.7796,13.0853,1.2162,0.0359,0.1599,9.6909,0.008,3.5284,2.2496,2.2685,0.6864,5.7589,1.9604,0.7507,0.8324,3.6299,3.501,6.5294,1.53,8.662,1.6536,1.7858,0.5769,2.3755,2.3103,3.7904,1.1172,5.8703,0.0641,5.5916,2.1322,6.2667,2.5735,1.6978,6.7281,5.6182,0.0031,0.7739,1.5259,3.1496,0.2855,2.6627,0.6709,0.2942,3.2901,0.4245,1.2955,1.014,4.2819,2.6888,0.0089,5.3065,4.7473,6.3989,3.4627,2.7362,5.7983,2.2969,5.7762,6.4777,1.1783,5.4209,3.7157,6.6624,8.0073,2.1678,5.0438,0.8683,1.6014,1.3995,2.7657,7.1495,5.066,0.3034,2.5939,4.2438,0.2874,0.0004,0.8058,0.0354,0.0363,0.0091,1.7251,0.6411,4.4157,3.158,0.0402,3.1081,8.0334,0.4512,5.3858,1.0364,4.2485,8.5756,2.1333,1.6987,0.2041,0.9815,5.551,0.9417,0.5586,1.6866,2.8732,0.8977,5.6747,1.0085,0.143,6.2748,5.5063,0.0126,3.8021,3.8332,2.7825,0.0392,15.0183,9.008,5.8088,4.1991,0.6058,0.5124,5.4163,0.0052,0.0226,0.5144,0.0151,0.0183,0.1748,0.2381,4.7551,4.2747,8.0561,4.8362,2.3118,10.2601,8.0584,0.0847,1.2081,6.1776,2.9891,0.1225,8.0529,3.8259,2.7555,1.7018,4.6657,0.8868,4.9615,2.6127,1.3816,1.3019,1.3839,2.2167,0.0003,0.1343,0.0158,0.0056,0.1912,0.8074,3.9249,1.2181,5.1497,6.1327,4.5132,1.3293,3.1511,0.0074,2.621,4.1007,1.882,5.3948,4.5325,0.4576,7.0965,3.2973,9.8519,8.5044,4.0239,5.4217,2.3079,4.8872,1.1911,2.5641,3.8091,2.0656,3.1631,4.9538,5.3952,1.0563,3.389,2.1026,2.9158,5.8573,2.2659,2.5286,1.7335,2.4518,15.6666,0.4574,0.0236,4.0768,1.5354,0.0001,6.2221,3.3051,0.9177,0.194,0.5173,2.2663,3.6192,1.3577,14.6964,2.3207,7.6655,0.4774,8.9688,0.6537,0.0997,7.578,7.4763,4.1419,2.133,0.8547,0.3842,7.9064,0.3586,0.0014,4.0906,1.7576,0.0004,0.0122,3.8016,5.3197,0.9656,1.6532,2.4874,6.3878,8.4884,2.3764,4.4771,5.0959,4.3461,2.0328,8.1796,0.8718,1.5161,10.2919,4.2997,2.6114,2.4522,5.6661,0.2259,3.1832,7.3615,4.9114,8.1389,2.4141,0.6818,1.1902,4.7047,0.0028,0.7546,3.5509,0.1209,6.2588,0.5,1.9945,3.8789,0.101,5.3991,1.4312,5.1263,3.9552,1.4169,2.9348,5.6305,0.8545,2.9036,1.821,4.723,0.6143,2.7428,1.7702,4.4606,9.0744,5.481,0.0059,2.9737,4.08,3.4165,1.6736,2.7402,0.0044,6.5359,3.5517,3.083,3.0526,3.0978,1.9821,4.7794,0.1721,0.5195,1.2103,1.0307,5.2772,3.9884,3.16,0.0105,0.0014,5.8929,0.079,0.0321,2.9449,0.0966,1.5936,3.1206,3.2759,0.1309,2.3856,4.941,0.4569,0.0129,4.7442,2.3269,0.0033,0.0164,4.2166,3.5799,8.3038,1.2966,0.9297,6.1756,1.3058,1.3481,1.8273,6.3431,1.9873,1.9279,2.896,0.521,3.4679,2.8944,0.5061,7.9252,3.0083,1.1535,3.5049,0.0228,0.0018,0.0,3.8009,7.3059,0.2604,5.7378,7.3314,3.0942,5.6667,0.6872,6.0728,10.5662,9.7858,3.6101,7.7413,4.398,8.5683,1.3569,1.1472,2.7981,3.6686,2.4391,1.8474,0.0071,0.0488,0.0007,3.7918,2.9458,3.0334,3.2049,5.3185,1.3623,1.0836,5.3311,1.3018,1.3037,5.5434,0.0012,2.4532,5.5419,1.0842,1.967,1.5828,0.0007,0.1188,0.2381,1.7927,5.2791,0.5529,1.7117,3.7904,1.7299,3.3383,0.0378,3.7683,0.0024,4.8551,1.8732,4.6156,1.717,2.8617,3.0102,0.9765,0.5735,0.8924,0.7651,0.962,0.0025,0.0279,1.6471,2.9479,1.373,0.8861,1.0913,5.1399,0.0031,0.3558,0.0532,0.2282,7.7581,5.5727,2.1901,0.0118,0.0154,0.0002,4.143,2.1548,7.0943,1.9666,2.214,3.8669,8.9651,2.0549,4.994,1.6682,7.5241,0.4746,4.8651,3.052,6.6389,4.4384,5.7471,3.4659,2.034,3.1499,6.7256,4.1371,4.6555,3.9483,0.47,1.6532,4.9879,4.152,3.8964,4.2405,0.0601,1.029,5.172,7.1012,4.8324,2.264,1.196,8.7011,2.0128,1.0034,2.6523]}

ISIS has been fighting back in Iraq and Syria, where Ankara has launched raids as part of a coalition against the terror group.\nAs the president was considering whether to send more troops to the former Islamic state on Sunday, he relayed the King\u2019s message to the commander, according to the news agency. During the phone call, Trump and Erdogan were discussing a planned American attack on one of ISIS\u2019 oil depots and the situation in Afghanistan.\nThe Pentagon said on Friday that the operation, which was scheduled to move forward on Wednesday was delayed by several hours. The delay came after Turkish troops entered Syrian, but the American troops planned to use precision-guided rockets to attack ISIS targets in Syria.\nISIS had been pushing forward on the battlefield, taking cities like Al-Bab and Hasakah on the Syrian border. The group now controls the oil terminals of Hasakah. While the U.S. military has made the oil terminal a key target since it was captured by ISIS, the Pentagon has said that it has no plans to target the oil terminals in any attack.\nISIS has now lost over half of its territory lost in the war with Russia and the Syrian government and has suffered heavy defeats in the last few weeks in Iraq and the Syrian Arab regions.\nThe U.S. says that it plans to keep up pressure on the group but said it has not chosen a route for further military action.\nIn a statement, the White House said after a phone conversation with the Turkish president. Trump called Trump and asked him to extend the operation in northern Iraq until October, a source told AP on Sunday. Washington and Ankara say they are not interested in destroying Syria\u2019s government but want the United States to limit the flow of weapons into the country.\nTrump said earlier on Twitter that ISIS has been eliminated once and for all and that the Turkish army will not get any more troops from Washington.\nThe president expressed his gratitude for the cooperation of the Turkish president and promised to continue this support and the fight for the Syrian Kurds who face a similar fate as in Turkey.","token_len":504,"entropy":[7.8686,10.0035,8.9994,1.9036,9.058,1.0286,7.0396,5.4915,4.0041,0.5572,0.7363,2.4166,2.2454,2.4372,4.2695,1.1077,3.1518,3.1558,5.6329,2.8072,1.1476,4.5955,2.3557,4.483,0.9026,0.0263,1.169,2.7468,4.8582,4.7699,2.5412,0.011,3.3664,1.9344,6.3283,0.0231,2.2223,3.9509,4.6207,2.813,4.2072,2.5667,3.6356,0.0006,0.0058,0.7662,0.1747,0.0843,2.5327,0.3399,14.2718,6.4062,3.5344,1.555,5.2083,0.9667,0.4492,0.189,1.4256,3.8317,1.9411,0.0332,0.3178,2.2528,4.9423,2.2498,5.0246,3.4799,3.1081,3.092,4.8135,0.4707,2.113,3.7741,1.0377,4.7485,0.2612,1.9695,0.0031,1.8455,8.0082,1.553,1.6994,2.4927,5.9313,1.6762,1.6796,0.3211,0.0498,1.3163,2.6196,8.6692,0.8043,3.7078,5.3028,5.0751,0.873,0.0008,1.2891,4.6651,0.911,0.7936,4.3222,0.0466,0.4269,0.249,5.8136,1.7449,3.0662,3.7431,6.9554,2.6439,0.1223,3.3339,2.52,0.9497,0.3947,1.1836,8.611,4.9283,3.1713,5.8063,4.1005,0.1958,3.1166,6.7301,1.5527,6.6507,13.0302,9.7143,0.2558,1.1812,0.6725,1.5476,4.6712,3.6377,2.4758,0.0052,0.6499,2.2699,0.082,0.2228,6.3817,0.3183,2.0269,0.119,0.0998,1.5612,4.5291,3.7521,2.992,2.1089,2.6764,4.9665,5.8735,4.986,0.4062,6.2804,0.051,3.3227,9.8753,0.4247,17.7557,3.5585,0.0093,3.248,2.1332,5.5235,0.3822,5.8267,0.7162,0.2959,1.4276,5.9231,1.2012,2.4619,2.186,0.2815,1.372,4.6414,3.2437,0.8631,2.3648,4.5468,0.3334,6.9242,2.5434,2.3054,3.2269,8.4714,2.1163,2.0357,3.4016,1.1067,1.6935,1.9385,5.2203,3.1999,0.9109,3.4877,3.1185,3.4186,3.4122,6.6467,5.4671,2.8446,4.9962,3.185,7.6625,0.1798,4.7303,6.9658,0.9469,0.0221,4.5898,1.3519,3.0068,0.8004,1.9468,1.2084,1.7475,0.9196,0.4019,6.2215,4.001,1.7626,5.3654,5.025,3.3258,1.1536,2.6645,2.6724,4.2727,5.615,2.4088,5.2578,0.5755,1.4163,0.0712,1.2469,6.444,0.0695,0.0001,5.299,1.5128,2.4439,1.6259,1.598,1.9043,1.091,4.9313,0.5734,3.2372,3.3121,5.0722,2.3899,5.9229,0.0082,0.0001,4.3003,5.7456,1.0722,2.0381,0.0004,0.0025,0.2491,2.095,1.0974,4.9711,4.0753,5.2774,2.7264,1.1592,1.6483,2.1505,5.6156,2.3714,0.8988,2.8353,1.0754,1.9606,1.4009,1.0968,4.344,2.4958,1.9384,1.2386,1.5018,1.79,2.0213,1.0235,0.0852,4.2854,0.9074,1.438,1.6018,1.9427,4.2279,4.8119,0.7264,0.3465,5.0156,1.06,5.1828,3.9195,5.6716,2.6205,0.4994,0.2193,0.3104,8.4582,1.3106,1.1164,2.3059,2.4542,4.3766,1.6212,2.1095,1.8379,0.603,3.5511,1.1125,5.7741,2.1656,4.865,0.6321,1.8086,2.5658,1.5261,1.3914,1.9962,2.3966,0.2683,3.7359,2.7856,4.3286,11.4916,0.5076,1.0639,1.6118,2.1182,0.0005,0.0046,0.3328,5.216,1.4846,1.8954,3.472,0.0917,5.1303,3.5746,3.9633,0.2343,1.2091,1.5306,4.6599,3.5038,1.7397,2.3648,1.492,6.91,1.4375,5.1932,1.6204,4.7927,3.2522,0.6872,0.5838,0.9177,3.5302,1.2565,1.0699,0.936,0.8344,2.1224,0.0021,0.2262,7.0174,4.3955,4.4356,2.073,0.6831,1.1493,2.1845,0.2468,4.0456,3.6274,3.4621,3.3929,1.9513,2.9026,1.0535,0.4202,5.6842,1.2492,4.2364,3.1588,5.4407,0.9681,2.9868,4.7181,1.9528,3.4096,4.5642,1.787,5.7259,2.7077,2.8943,0.1812,6.0761,3.2399,1.2063,4.4505,1.1975,1.2876,3.2264,4.0458,0.0146,7.4529,5.2935,5.6651,0.2548,0.858,2.405,3.0309,2.4353,2.4836,3.3889,0.0104,0.1656,8.4076,1.1626,2.964,0.0243,1.7376,3.1792,0.8255,0.4336,0.7804,0.5729,2.6601,2.2084,5.2524,1.7814,4.4426,0.1769,4.1497,2.6394,1.9274,6.0827,7.4788,2.0917,0.2344,0.0008,1.8802,0.9243,1.3229,6.1287,3.4025,3.2502,2.2426,5.7091,4.7381,1.045,2.8002,2.9792,2.9355,0.6805,0.7762,1.728,3.0434,4.3082,1.276,3.3357,1.2205,0.9588,3.1983,0.7963,0.9507,1.024,3.9213,0.7573,6.4931,0.6125,1.4667,4.9265,3.5982,3.6256,4.18,3.6929,3.9911,1.0447,2.4831,4.1933,3.7266,4.1601,1.9042,4.4591,0.5084,1.8975,5.0291,4.1641,0.537]}
{"prompt":"U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Monday assured the Baltic states of U.S. support if they faced aggression from Russia , telling them that Washington firmly backs NATO \u2019 s doctrine of collective defense .","text":"U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Monday assured the Baltic states of U.S. support if they faced aggression from Russia, telling them that Washington firmly backs NATO \u2019 s doctrine of collective defense. The move is likely to further aggravate tensions with Russia, which had earlier accused American naval ships and aircraft of breaking its territorial waters this week. The Baltic states are considered vulnerable to military threats of other countries, such as Russia. A visit by the U.S. ships and aircraft raised questions of the intentions of Moscow to intervene militarily in internal affairs of the countries. \u201c In the event of military aggression,\u201d Pence tweeted, \u201cour Navy \u2026 together with our friends there will stand in our aid with whatever support is necessary. \u201c In a meeting with representatives of the foreign ministers from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in Washington, Pence repeated that Washington \u201c strongly believes that collective defense is the one and only viable path to protecting our freedom and national security. \u201c He emphasized that collective defense is \u201c our collective commitment to the security of the Baltic states, both today and in the near future. \u201c At the same time, the United States is not calling on NATO to take up military action against Russian troops, he said. \u201c Our goal here is to deter or deter aggression, not to launch an offensive, not an aggressive military action, \u201d he stated. Pence also said that he spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The statement comes a day after officials from the three Baltic states reported on the violation of their territorial waters along the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland (the Sea of Azov) by the Russian military. Two days ago, the U.S. Navy ships USS Ross and USS George Washington participated in the exercise \u201c Northern Watch 18 \u201c, which took place within 5 nautical miles of the Russian coast.

China\u2019s steel and aluminum industries are in the midst of negotiations with nations like the United States, Mexico and Canada that involve about a third of global steel production and 10 percent of global aluminum.\n\u201cThere are also negotiations about intellectual property protections, on issues of public health, on issues of environmental protection, on the transparency with which trade deals are negotiated,\u201d Azevedo said, adding that the U.S. was in the beginning phase of a trade war with China and that \u201cthe focus in the next period has to continue focusing on the economic and financial cooperation of the G20.\u201d\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week that he will be willing to work with countries that oppose Trump\u2019s trade policies and has told European Union officials that he would work on trade deals.\nThe next meeting of the World Trade Organization is on Nov. 11 and 12. Azevedo said some decisions will be made before the end of the meeting, but he said the finalized results are expected at the meeting in January.\nThe U.S. government has said that China\u2019s steel subsidies and the tariffs on steel and aluminum are violations of the WTO\u2019s rules.\nChina\u2019s steel and aluminum industries use subsidy and quota schemes, to limit exports, to keep the industry solvent.\nIn the steel industry, China imposed a quota system on steel imports and then provided preferential prices and other subsidies for steel producers.","token_len":505,"entropy":[6.7193,0.0882,0.0354,0.0301,2.9584,0.6911,0.0046,12.5043,9.8588,7.7842,7.4122,0.0828,5.9752,0.0005,5.6223,4.1743,6.5616,6.6221,0.2874,0.4639,3.0443,4.1003,13.3869,0.4376,2.8675,2.6086,4.9746,3.782,0.0267,5.0175,7.8108,2.2794,0.7108,1.2004,3.8099,2.2588,2.685,5.824,4.7778,0.4055,0.969,3.1271,0.1151,0.0056,1.2601,2.3849,0.3051,0.2157,16.5122,5.3326,6.5337,1.1148,2.1535,4.0424,5.3267,0.3636,6.2259,4.0065,4.3962,1.3138,2.6924,3.5126,4.3947,1.2476,1.8265,6.4129,0.0127,0.6691,9.782,7.9426,10.4813,4.4702,4.5328,0.0006,0.0011,0.975,1.4851,3.3785,9.3751,3.6614,1.952,5.1923,0.3038,0.32,0.5352,6.8515,0.4361,2.2842,2.724,3.4556,0.2662,0.5683,9.5813,0.3929,0.0004,0.0006,2.3468,2.245,1.1242,4.4622,3.3386,1.063,0.8124,1.5845,2.2683,3.1748,5.8504,2.0138,9.0241,1.6444,5.4076,2.7561,0.6542,1.7665,7.8049,0.7528,0.4517,1.3854,2.2674,1.6631,4.7289,1.7104,4.979,9.5767,0.7953,0.0281,6.4555,4.1007,3.2149,0.7478,2.6931,3.4868,6.799,2.7732,2.3713,6.1168,4.8456,1.7208,1.3529,1.2194,0.0008,0.0057,0.0647,2.1415,3.4606,3.741,0.0829,1.117,0.2799,0.2957,0.2374,4.4824,0.2486,0.0008,0.0009,4.9444,2.6982,1.6856,2.7877,11.1225,0.5793,0.0004,0.1614,0.1493,6.4424,2.0887,0.7502,8.0508,0.8533,1.252,4.4699,2.1935,3.1126,0.0015,0.1458,7.5696,2.3019,1.9686,1.3332,6.4083,1.9273,2.374,3.1149,6.3224,3.3643,1.7802,3.2435,4.9237,0.9314,5.388,7.2421,0.3091,0.5746,2.2227,0.2581,0.2015,3.0473,4.0124,0.0839,2.1186,1.5572,6.263,3.7986,0.0174,0.0354,5.3548,1.4592,0.05,4.7084,1.7057,3.7091,1.8638,1.6902,0.0032,4.1812,0.8854,7.8829,3.5273,1.5789,0.9546,0.0627,1.1915,3.0681,0.5501,0.7406,2.6355,6.1114,5.7974,3.0833,1.8648,0.0614,2.6465,1.3098,0.6606,2.4414,6.0732,0.2739,0.0669,1.7205,0.7734,3.183,0.3231,1.9022,0.4503,5.1335,1.0542,2.4284,4.6675,3.1504,7.2077,0.0063,4.5307,1.7847,6.5794,3.8954,3.667,4.4784,1.4688,0.8127,3.282,4.2701,0.406,2.6782,0.6553,0.8779,0.9837,2.9098,7.3195,5.3064,0.4149,3.4182,1.8338,0.1871,0.4934,0.684,5.6003,2.694,0.5494,0.0021,0.0009,0.0014,0.1478,2.3155,1.2903,0.2505,1.3276,2.5205,0.0005,0.0054,0.089,3.0427,3.4874,1.4753,7.9113,5.5532,0.1688,2.2292,2.7691,2.358,0.7499,0.6215,2.0533,1.3789,9.8221,0.1877,1.5951,5.7661,3.9442,1.0007,4.3874,5.5066,4.4141,1.006,5.5725,6.2075,0.0569,1.6385,3.9609,1.7892,3.9924,6.9186,1.756,0.9536,5.1241,3.1712,2.0603,5.392,4.0433,0.1269,5.2164,0.0036,0.0091,0.1008,3.9538,0.0734,0.0093,0.0003,0.0002,1.6508,3.8819,0.5342,0.2675,1.7241,4.0433,3.2018,5.8588,0.017,2.704,0.1584,4.1649,2.2663,4.7087,4.1927,2.8536,0.0513,0.0176,2.2589,1.8926,2.5199,4.3873,3.6851,4.9314,1.2886,1.6045,0.7042,1.0307,2.0393,3.3603,3.8629,2.1529,2.7843,3.3582,0.4056,2.3086,5.7937,2.904,0.7439,0.1828,4.3233,0.0033,0.0193,1.2652,3.8096,3.3295,0.0035,3.1974,3.3755,2.3441,1.7392,3.1181,1.0919,0.0018,0.0012,0.5131,6.0319,6.734,2.0988,0.5979,0.7842,3.2738,1.1101,2.2185,0.0574,0.6063,3.1103,1.1018,0.8826,1.5952,1.4067,1.6008,9.7429,4.7316,2.3305,1.4306,4.5307,0.6278,3.927,1.528,4.1933,0.2528,0.2635,2.268,2.6992,0.0005,0.0206,0.0901,4.1878,1.2429,2.6028,1.4567,2.9047,4.6467,0.0159,0.0028,3.6129,5.0083,2.2194,1.717,2.981,1.9849,2.4411,2.2889,0.0545,1.3964,5.576,0.0205,1.5973,1.012,6.4031,0.0215,0.6113,1.4898,1.4831,0.8342,3.4912,3.2883,0.0034,0.0162,1.8186,0.6685,0.021,2.0653,5.8203,6.9703,3.0662,7.0996,3.83,3.0103,4.9413,5.2607,3.4939,1.7414,0.5023,4.525,3.3246,4.621,5.8078,1.6981,1.216,3.4349,2.5704,9.2282,0.7884,0.1259,2.479,7.4061,1.6554,2.8949,1.3751,2.6235,2.6052,1.8944,2.7298,4.6518,6.1392,4.5443,4.4958,3.9339,3.7957,2.1114,2.1989,2.8754,2.3777,1.0124]}

They urged Trump to immediately begin the process under the legislation. \u201cThe legislation is clear on what the president must do,\u201d Cardin, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in the letter. \u201cNow that he has signed the legislation, he cannot be expected to waste any more time.\u201d Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts, is asking the Department of Justice to launch an investigation into the Trump administration for improper conduct, including with regard to the National Guard that helped in the transition, and she\u2019s told the Department of Justice to investigate why it\u2019s taking so long to approve Trump\u2019s nominees for top posts, Politico reported. Trump announced he would fire John Bolton, his national-security adviser, after two and a half years in the job, to replace him with retired General Michael Flynn, Politico reported. The move was the latest in a series of recent changes to the administration, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announcing they want to leave soon. With Trump reportedly preparing to announce candidates for top U.S. positions on Wednesday, Warren took aim at Trump and the Trump administration. Senator Warren, who\u2019s been pushing to take advantage of the legislation to make a stand on China\u2019s economy, said, \u201cInstead of protecting our country from a growing global threat, he seems to be more interested in protecting his ego that is bigger than the interests of American workers and families.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump also nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill the nation\u2019s high court vacancy. Trump has now nominated three Supreme Court justices: Thomas, Kennedy, and Barrett. On Tuesday, he told reporters he was \u201cprepared\u201d to nominate four. He said he believed Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett had the \u201cright\u201d qualifications to be a justice. \u201cShe\u2019s got to be a really great jurist to actually be a justice on the Supreme Court, and I think she\u2019s that great \u2014 but as far as running, there\u2019s no question that she would do a wonderful job if nominated.

This will not allow the federal government to waive the legal restrictions that restrict foreign vessels from coming to the islands, said Rossello. \u201cWe are asking the government to waive the Jones Act, because that\u2019s what we are looking for right now,\u201d he said. Under the Jones Act, ships carrying relief supplies are restricted from passing into U.S. waters. The governor said he hoped Washington would respond to his request as quickly and as forcefully as it has done for other victims. \u201cThey have already given us so much help since the aftermath of the hurricane. If we lose that, we will lose a lot of life,\u201d he said.\nA group of researchers from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have reported that \u201clarge volcanic eruptions can have a surprisingly rapid consequence for the climate system\u201d.\nThe new study, based on historical evidence of volcanic forcing and models, suggests that large eruptions that occur around 8,500 years ago and between 3,000 and 12,500 years ago produced a rapid cooling in the North Atlantic region, which has been attributed to the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\u201cLarge volcanic eruptions seem to have a relatively rapid impact on the climate through the rapid and dramatic release of trace gases from their magmatic sources,\u201d said Richard Eley, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Sheffield and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cThe rapid cooling in the North Atlantic region and the subsequent Northern Hemisphere warming are also consistent with evidence from ice cores and marine sediment cores showing a similar pattern.\u201d","token_len":506,"entropy":[6.81,0.4728,0.2132,5.0764,0.3415,0.0042,0.0024,2.2874,2.3193,2.1422,2.0565,2.4179,4.8288,1.5544,2.8302,0.1006,0.53,5.6032,1.6333,11.3755,0.0921,2.1743,0.8365,3.3721,7.0563,2.5118,0.0906,6.5272,2.3029,4.2677,6.8583,3.2212,0.3649,2.1041,1.6341,9.2618,0.0212,0.1175,0.3352,3.8014,5.2456,0.1282,5.6504,0.058,5.7185,1.8351,7.4431,3.7212,0.8884,3.4472,1.3621,0.7669,4.6908,3.7634,0.386,0.0332,2.2508,0.673,4.4562,4.1811,2.4755,0.3407,1.269,1.4056,3.0632,0.0978,10.994,6.0558,4.109,9.0162,0.22,0.8409,2.2055,1.8373,5.4366,2.9025,4.2811,3.4859,2.2131,3.5151,5.8563,7.1962,1.7448,3.8392,4.6426,0.0418,2.81,4.2344,0.8502,0.9486,0.0538,0.5993,3.7436,4.656,0.7583,4.2334,3.4496,5.2153,1.402,6.6516,11.1863,7.0738,4.965,0.2864,3.9687,2.7253,7.1091,3.7856,0.0945,10.4365,2.342,0.6544,1.6311,4.5323,0.8097,2.0914,1.9626,2.5302,1.9269,0.9118,1.4271,0.0159,1.7989,4.1501,3.0229,0.5394,0.0144,3.679,0.2697,3.082,6.414,1.4254,3.3754,7.2061,1.2166,2.9063,3.3113,3.7262,1.1648,1.7224,1.2412,3.6766,3.2293,5.0169,1.9681,5.7055,2.6044,4.2234,6.543,7.0302,0.2979,1.2926,3.8179,2.6514,2.0348,5.8122,0.0048,4.5395,2.661,6.7852,3.0512,0.2966,3.0366,6.3213,4.5102,3.4129,1.1863,5.1299,0.001,0.0034,0.2268,6.987,0.0233,0.9209,4.3703,3.1912,3.2668,4.8391,1.676,1.7974,0.0103,0.0601,4.5898,0.7123,8.1674,3.1329,2.3621,5.8087,3.3523,4.9778,0.4456,5.4868,1.0089,1.0735,3.5304,2.2405,3.3057,1.2136,0.0223,0.0008,0.6259,1.7128,0.2533,1.8901,1.7595,3.678,0.7248,2.7587,0.3597,2.2985,0.8741,0.792,0.0059,1.7886,3.1957,2.2596,13.3394,9.1647,3.5959,1.9419,0.9212,1.7679,3.2634,0.454,3.0913,0.017,1.5605,0.6036,0.6054,0.8149,0.4317,0.3241,7.9889,0.4047,2.2175,0.0083,0.0706,2.5264,3.4369,4.0142,1.1544,2.2156,6.4067,0.3482,5.0538,3.1245,3.5704,0.0007,0.0016,0.0676,2.059,1.6442,1.837,5.5797,0.9742,1.6917,3.5719,7.2324,0.3474,4.8387,1.2996,3.6093,1.402,4.2885,0.7073,3.2933,1.4972,3.9244,0.0075,3.1625,2.4554,1.675,3.824,3.7334,6.7133,2.1584,1.8897,0.2156,5.6163,2.0993,3.0464,5.4187,1.0896,5.4783,0.6478,2.951,5.7452,1.1927,6.8118,0.1966,1.718,1.1694,1.3533,4.3144,1.272,6.6984,2.4999,1.6188,1.1482,1.3772,0.8377,3.0227,0.3331,0.7259,5.2058,1.7744,0.9753,0.4759,0.4425,0.2622,0.1592,1.8928,8.8356,4.9189,0.1368,7.3094,1.3056,7.7047,1.8595,2.9228,0.5953,1.7517,0.0142,0.8098,2.8982,2.136,3.9774,1.0629,11.45,1.1941,6.408,8.7367,0.4044,0.0,3.0574,3.6884,1.3704,10.1795,4.4837,7.8883,3.2212,1.7271,3.438,3.4048,2.1813,1.2376,5.304,1.5166,2.177,5.515,1.2402,1.5711,3.9099,0.0433,6.092,4.6854,2.9928,1.848,8.4101,2.2709,5.9236,2.0152,2.419,0.2404,3.9097,1.1456,0.0003,3.7887,1.8902,4.4128,7.0402,1.4363,2.8097,0.3763,0.1317,3.0609,6.1015,3.1878,0.0903,0.5403,0.1253,4.0435,0.0015,2.2333,0.0223,0.0479,5.494,1.8241,4.2532,3.3442,3.2189,0.3122,5.3508,0.452,4.456,1.5815,2.0953,2.8164,1.6101,4.0737,0.1013,1.6573,5.3286,0.0227,3.473,0.5582,0.0009,2.9435,0.1033,3.3407,0.2179,1.3874,0.5222,0.8879,3.1617,0.3231,4.4085,0.7386,0.0366,0.0001,7.2955,0.0985,1.5038,1.7169,2.9664,1.8976,2.0946,0.1182,0.5395,0.6527,5.6827,1.6281,4.2865,3.9249,3.6762,3.9748,0.0275,8.9807,0.7733,1.8522,3.8291,5.4879,2.0402,3.2939,1.5023,2.7291,0.6753,1.9544,4.6392,4.7724,7.4701,0.2273,0.6803,4.1014,0.1549,1.0138,0.5887,0.5185,0.7203,0.0055,4.5176,1.6435,2.3193,1.1304,11.7366,5.5686,2.7744,0.3697,0.0154,0.2592,3.2493,0.143,1.6116,3.9921,1.2077,1.6975,0.327,0.1723,0.0103,1.9251,4.1638,0.9527,3.5152,9.2734,0.1124,1.6507,2.8138,3.9205,3.3191,0.0094,4.4708,1.4979,6.1234,0.0868,2.1503,4.8826,1.3036,0.5733,3.2922,2.2241,4.8764,3.4848,1.6912,2.5085,1.9904]}
{"prompt":"The head of the U.S. Senate committee that handles Supreme Court nominees said on Friday he no longer expected an imminent court vacancy , bolstering assumptions that Justice Anthony Kennedy would not retire this year","text":"The head of the U.S. Senate committee that handles Supreme Court nominees said on Friday he no longer expected an imminent court vacancy, bolstering assumptions that Justice Anthony Kennedy would not retire this year despite a longstanding desire to step down.\nSen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that while some senators had hoped to fill Kennedy's seat in 2020 with former District of Columbia Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch, they had been \"disappointed\" with Gorsuch's nomination from President Donald Trump's pick for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\"The president has indicated that he intends to take the appointment to Chief Justice in the very near future. He announced his intent to take that job last week,\" he said. \"I would not be surprised if that happened in a few days, weeks or maybe a year, if his terms are extended.\"\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee's schedule, which the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Claire McCaskill, announced in May, will give Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska a chance to replace Kennedy, making him the Senate's first nominee to the post in eight years.\nBut the delay to Sasse's confirmation from Republican senators who supported President Donald Trump's Gorsuch nomination has raised doubts about whether the post will open before January 2021, when it is widely expected to become vacant to accommodate President-elect Joe Biden's plans to make a cabinet shakeup.\nIt also came as a bipartisan group of senators working on justice reform, led by the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued an open letter to President Donald Trump asking him to delay his planned nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.\n\"It's hard to look forward to the arrival of your potential successor to this high court bench,\" the letter said. \"We know that you take responsibility for your role in the election. But it's imperative that you respect the seriousness of the judicial search and also the responsibility of your office to hold presidential nominees to high standards.\"\nThe letter came just one week after U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota and a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, called on senators to oppose the confirmation of Barrett as a justice.\n\"Before you approve Judge Barrett, the senators who will consider her nomination must carefully review her judicial record, carefully consider both her record as a judge as well as her life and her character,\" Klobuchar wrote in a letter to senators.","token_len":506,"entropy":[7.2534,0.3819,0.7821,4.2036,0.1724,0.2284,0.1106,3.9825,3.5667,2.3677,4.7242,8.3306,0.0089,2.378,1.9162,2.8854,1.9717,2.4066,6.6464,0.005,4.5262,4.1533,4.5157,4.5744,4.3912,2.7007,9.872,0.0023,11.0883,0.5527,5.2383,2.0763,0.1064,1.2771,2.4281,4.7303,4.0989,0.3826,5.3303,1.7952,5.6411,4.0431,0.5786,5.3198,0.3181,0.7865,0.1114,23.1452,0.3424,3.7042,0.4517,2.5239,0.002,0.574,0.9713,1.2885,0.022,0.0483,0.4565,0.992,0.0202,0.0965,0.5948,3.0842,2.5276,5.426,2.3712,3.11,3.7698,1.9066,4.3606,1.6796,0.0303,0.631,2.3958,4.3775,5.3551,5.8956,6.0715,0.5789,0.0006,1.053,0.5731,2.2341,0.0121,0.1353,2.6873,1.7634,2.269,2.0078,3.9868,0.3512,0.3934,1.4807,4.3405,0.3343,2.7234,5.8972,5.2103,1.3694,0.0111,1.6341,2.6698,0.7492,0.4258,2.4217,0.0002,0.0024,0.0013,2.9062,0.0015,0.0012,0.0141,0.0016,1.7379,0.0034,0.0056,0.0041,0.0007,0.3616,0.2172,0.7496,2.6142,2.2109,1.3057,3.8066,0.9855,0.1792,2.9935,0.0331,4.4466,1.8874,4.0983,3.5376,8.0634,0.0626,3.244,1.7632,4.8816,0.1025,0.0242,2.8411,2.5548,7.1676,1.987,2.2768,0.2572,2.9148,2.3797,2.722,3.3755,1.2628,0.995,2.6291,0.3564,0.9175,1.2243,1.7583,3.6894,1.8134,1.2662,0.1402,0.2191,2.3706,3.7735,2.6251,2.7592,1.1708,3.4296,1.9634,6.7721,0.9682,4.7095,2.7942,1.1557,1.9744,2.2038,5.1828,6.698,0.9343,2.9283,1.4666,0.0752,1.9614,2.0286,1.2373,0.0313,2.7711,6.7377,3.1554,1.1062,4.4382,1.7176,4.0314,2.8863,0.2902,0.5821,1.1809,0.0004,5.2548,0.0001,0.0001,0.0,1.3175,3.8558,2.6229,2.9584,0.0871,3.2616,3.881,4.8086,0.0009,5.9619,0.9324,0.0004,1.1826,0.0098,1.6784,1.6965,0.0578,3.8469,1.9462,1.3386,6.5627,1.7876,0.1928,4.9011,0.1482,2.1526,3.8821,0.9625,3.0057,5.5159,3.0686,4.6876,0.1458,0.1701,0.6377,2.9503,2.3062,3.7666,5.714,4.2625,0.0002,0.4176,2.0626,5.7484,6.2254,2.433,3.7143,4.4649,4.598,1.6968,0.0056,0.3936,10.1416,0.7154,2.115,2.5066,2.7723,0.4831,1.2804,1.5576,6.8254,0.7103,5.1676,4.447,5.6722,2.7735,1.344,0.9439,4.1608,1.6368,6.153,0.2597,0.2843,2.7952,3.7311,6.6121,5.6629,4.2885,4.1999,0.0099,9.6292,0.1868,1.0629,4.8343,0.4926,4.8935,2.052,4.4785,6.4084,0.4266,0.5877,0.2601,5.218,1.284,6.2473,0.5724,2.8519,5.1389,0.3639,0.1697,0.4359,6.9556,0.7669,6.7476,2.8372,1.8607,3.0317,0.0052,4.2953,1.8626,2.0598,0.0569,0.7418,4.4634,2.8193,1.7934,0.0117,0.9982,2.1608,1.7616,0.0131,3.9116,0.5172,0.1371,2.605,1.8157,4.9157,3.4169,1.5862,2.8327,8.5303,2.4175,2.8157,0.0048,0.9686,0.395,1.5257,0.0019,0.7597,0.4448,1.2656,3.1172,1.917,3.9475,0.1521,6.5749,2.6573,0.2003,1.8063,5.2703,0.0342,6.206,5.8044,1.4725,1.0975,4.0796,3.6048,1.2021,3.3082,0.9188,0.5839,0.499,0.7259,0.2025,0.6857,2.6209,3.1676,0.8817,1.5403,6.8062,6.556,0.1469,1.219,4.0224,0.6195,1.4791,6.5319,3.1181,2.3395,2.5873,0.989,4.8339,0.2541,0.4488,5.2777,0.9033,7.5975,0.2335,1.3745,4.1988,7.8725,1.8155,6.5494,2.3254,3.905,0.9316,2.1621,3.169,0.5312,3.9619,8.3234,1.2944,0.5958,4.1082,0.963,1.335,0.1351,1.5281,0.5481,3.2031,2.9304,3.4279,2.1673,0.1729,5.2752,0.0007,0.0034,0.0007,4.4989,6.122,0.0109,0.0001,0.0001,0.0,0.8042,1.4112,0.7646,0.6422,0.0234,3.2076,1.0555,2.2056,4.1919,0.5167,0.5272,2.3492,1.2381,0.0027,0.3577,2.7983,0.9348,5.7358,0.3016,4.2633,1.8771,2.5048,0.0463,4.3445,2.3617,1.7787,4.5592,1.7371,0.4396,1.4351,7.1516,1.9898,6.6422,1.7157,0.544,0.7674,3.632,5.7856,2.103,3.0834,5.0499,1.1113,1.2614,1.096,5.1229,2.9993,1.8254,4.9274,0.1772,1.4442,6.4062,0.8753,6.0078,0.9679,1.4899,1.598,0.3642,1.9656,4.6675,0.3121,0.004,0.5698,6.2816,2.1571,2.3869,5.448,0.9877,1.2135,0.0006,0.0009,0.0013,0.8499,0.8851,0.4538,0.5692,0.4554,3.0268,1.2325]}

However, too many bulbs could lead to an undesirable effect in your home. The most noticeable one is energy loss.\nThe first suggestion is to use ceiling fans to increase air circulation in the interiors. However, we want to mention the energy-saving ceiling fans that could save up a considerable amount of energy and provide comfort all at the same time.\nThese fans feature three unique features: they have no rotating blades; have soft lighting and; have a wide range of temperature settings that could be controlled by the user.\nThe first option is the \u201csmart\u201d ceiling fan that not only can increase air circulation but can also increase the beauty of your space. This fan features three light modes \u2013 bright, low, and natural to adjust the lights in the house according to your preference.\nThe second thing that this fan can provide are a series of cooling settings. Some fans offer settings from high to low while others offer two or three levels.\nIn our opinion, having a fan that could help you avoid the discomfort from having too many bulbs in the lighting system could be beneficial. With the three lighting modes, you could adjust the lights of the space according to your preference.","token_len":506,"entropy":[8.2779,13.149,8.9513,7.5286,7.1986,1.1938,0.0315,0.4073,3.9767,1.2295,2.2554,2.7227,2.0296,3.2132,5.3823,2.9536,15.7239,4.9104,9.6658,1.9988,0.2268,9.135,2.0734,0.2478,8.0359,5.2402,0.0077,2.8768,5.2219,2.5148,6.1379,5.382,1.0913,0.5444,0.0119,3.3482,3.6003,0.0558,2.6056,0.0007,0.0674,0.0867,2.4864,0.1594,12.8539,5.8446,2.7358,0.0035,0.0512,0.0816,3.6029,5.2696,1.2624,2.685,4.8147,4.3278,4.8455,5.3449,6.5706,7.1433,2.151,3.1446,4.8675,3.5144,2.0639,3.1472,2.2932,1.1246,7.5157,6.834,2.1079,8.4352,3.8962,2.6178,1.0906,6.7071,4.7762,0.0106,0.0688,0.1697,1.9001,4.6884,0.0397,0.0868,6.7983,1.2055,3.8909,1.0074,5.0885,10.7995,0.1236,0.0644,0.131,4.2932,0.1088,9.0786,7.2924,5.3344,1.8637,0.0064,0.0089,0.0791,1.3368,1.7145,0.0138,0.0095,4.8079,0.043,0.2765,0.0634,0.0399,2.2,3.5362,0.0131,0.0285,0.1237,2.4015,2.6702,1.9403,3.733,3.6913,3.801,3.5073,5.259,3.0974,4.2912,2.2118,3.7757,3.0688,2.6574,2.5893,0.3188,7.9644,4.3278,6.259,4.0188,2.2465,2.7716,8.4624,11.7301,3.5172,5.6043,11.6408,7.9001,8.1559,2.5992,0.2298,0.1695,0.9806,0.1118,0.1271,0.0504,0.0549,0.0869,4.6893,3.4784,0.0533,0.0217,0.0918,0.0826,0.0731,0.0183,0.004,17.3121,5.0589,4.2417,2.8845,6.7253,4.9266,7.0896,5.1161,7.7323,6.2182,0.45,7.4483,2.2445,1.1686,8.7875,7.3466,6.3287,3.8767,5.3812,4.6783,0.0014,0.0052,0.0704,1.0927,5.4294,2.7195,0.2007,2.884,6.0322,3.6921,6.6749,7.8219,0.2602,0.367,0.0995,0.0294,0.9868,0.2712,0.0016,0.0053,0.0343,0.0353,0.0452,0.0137,0.0236,11.4293,9.0232,2.4103,4.7752,3.9646,5.923,4.1979,0.6721,1.2292,7.363,5.9941,0.4392,0.784,4.3983,0.8026,3.1529,5.5136,5.159,16.0444,2.8908,3.6594,2.4465,3.8401,1.5409,3.3739,0.2679,0.0229,0.7766,0.0173,0.0034,0.3921,4.061,0.6501,0.0007,0.0017,0.0219,0.1165,8.3409,10.3656,6.3563,4.8613,4.0322,8.2283,7.5774,0.4198,6.6958,8.2639,7.5696,6.8487,7.4767,5.2232,0.3479,1.5153,6.2153,3.0146,2.2465,5.7395,1.2933,5.5508,0.2228,7.0026,1.3848,10.0447,4.5925,3.5484,0.0934,3.514,4.1941,2.2573,3.2852,2.9659,0.4956,0.6815,2.8969,4.006,4.5368,5.0235,0.9845,7.9839,5.5576,1.1278,2.8537,2.4785,4.4796,7.6432,2.4612,0.9641,2.9499,8.4427,0.8467,1.6608,4.018,2.9971,0.6859,2.13,1.2693,7.5728,0.0102,0.8882,2.9762,0.0853,4.9042,5.3673,0.4487,5.1549,2.417,5.9342,5.1433,1.2812,7.0252,0.908,2.5817,4.3767,2.8249,4.6178,4.5792,4.5988,0.0559,0.0822,0.8559,2.9089,5.271,5.1225,7.841,3.6171,0.9631,0.0132,0.0068,0.2029,1.1776,5.9655,2.7252,6.1936,4.9866,7.0213,1.5409,0.956,5.2267,2.7006,4.3407,6.0533,2.3682,3.5211,5.5852,7.0792,7.1759,2.2393,9.9057,2.5433,1.074,4.9595,1.8727,0.0267,3.5617,3.8433,3.1872,3.5572,1.4979,3.5479,1.4472,1.248,0.5013,0.4262,1.2265,1.6382,1.7689,4.8953,0.5094,2.7213,10.1038,1.4187,9.6367,2.8478,4.0476,6.5418,0.2127,2.178,7.1813,0.0947,3.4846,3.5974,1.2818,0.0854,0.926,2.2658,0.2881,3.1219,1.2665,8.5007,0.39,0.9477,5.4559,0.6497,2.9182,2.0924,3.0488,2.3354,7.2333,3.674,5.4506,4.6501,0.6478,3.2309,0.8055,0.2466,7.4908,6.1356,6.8614,0.7596,6.5876,2.6213,1.4071,4.1834,5.0802,0.0137,1.2989,3.2069,0.2443,0.9428,1.2347,1.0248,6.4504,1.7981,4.6947,0.6118,1.4048,3.9085,3.4839,2.699,6.5782,0.0097,4.7221,5.1641,1.4772,5.9615,2.6861,4.4103,8.7544,5.1022,4.8681,0.3378,0.2778,5.3089,0.21,1.1759,5.43,1.746,0.3804,3.7227,1.3195,1.5822,3.1191,3.4571,1.728,0.5483,6.0807,1.5992,3.6217,0.7691,4.8231,3.4045,1.1548,5.657,2.2079,5.4011,4.196,4.119,2.8049,0.7695,2.0063,1.3368,2.1806,9.2117,2.6247,2.8481,1.3401,3.0464,1.1036,4.9137,1.57,4.6116,3.2799,0.3631,0.9885,1.3873,1.1278,3.9292,0.3624,4.1979,3.9614,1.1273,5.4631,2.9534,0.013,0.3463,0.9979,0.6691]}

The casualties ,","text":"A tropical storm in the southern Philippines triggered mudslides and flash floods that killed more than 100 people, while dozens are missing, police and disaster officials said on Saturday. The casualties, in the northern province of Albay, are the worst yet in the deadly monsoon, which has killed at least 60 people and left about 400 injured across the country. President Benigno Aquino urged the government to immediately put up food rations at disaster relief centers. \u201c At my request, the food rations have been sent to the affected areas as soon as possible,\u2019\u2019 Aquino said in a television broadcast. Relief efforts \u201c must continue at all levels so that these people can get the very basic necessities of life,\u2019\u2019 he added. The disaster, which has displaced hundreds more people, also halted agricultural activities in some areas and damaged a hydroelectric project. Thousands of people are receiving humanitarian assistance in government-run shelters in the town of Lipa, which is one of the worst hit localities with at least 30 people dead. The disaster has taken its toll mostly on farmers, many of whom lost their land or at least damaged the crops they sowed. \u201cThere has been a lot of damage to rice paddies and orchards and livestock as well,\u2019\u2019 said Arsenio Rodriguez, a local rice farmer who was displaced from his hometown of La Esperanza. \u201cWe had been worried that we may not be able to sell what we planted this year,\u2019\u2019 he said. Some 2,000 rice farmers have been relocated from La Esperanza to a government shelter in another area. At least 100 of them had not even begun to sow their rice in June as rain and flooding swept into La Esperanza. On Friday, the government put up food rations and temporary shelter for some 2,500 families in the affected area. The authorities said that at least 500 people had died from the floods through Saturday, the highest toll yet in the Philippines this year. The United Nations said Friday that it was sending relief supplies to help victims of three disasters that have hit parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. United Nations disaster relief coordinator Frank La Rue told reporters that he was in consultation with the Indonesia and Malaysian governments to decide on the timing and nature of the aid. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people impacted because of flooding but it\u2019s also possible that some are impacted by earthquakes,\u2019\u2019 the United Nations official said.

It\u2019s a lot smaller than the one about the Eurozone, which was the heart of the crisis of the last year and a half, but wasn\u2019t a summit on the eurozone.\u2019\n\u2018The summit\u2019s main objective is to provide an agreed framework for the negotiations, if and when they take place. It will be a discussion over Brexit, but the real purpose is to provide a framework that ensures that it will be agreed for the transition into the post-transition arrangements that come forward. And the two big principles that are to become the basis for any future negotiations are the principle of a fixed date for the end of the transition period and a clear set of arrangements for what happens after that with a clear deadline for withdrawal, which of course will be a time-limited option.\n\u2018The discussions in Brussels are very constructive and there is a chance that we find a breakthrough before the summit, but we are certainly not there yet. There is still a need for careful consideration of both the EU\u2019s case and the UK\u2019s position, so I don\u2019t see why we would be in a hurry. The fact is that it is going to take all three years, and beyond, to get to any kind of agreement.\u2019\n\u2018In my view, that is the one thing that is a reason for getting on with the preparations for the referendum in May, to make sure that we have the maximum resources that we can for campaigning so that the result is as clear and decisive as possible. All of the things that have been alleged in the last few days, that the campaign would be divided, that the leadership would end up being a very weak one, that the party would be fragmented around a lot of different positions, that things would be hard or would be tricky... all of those things are in part a function of time, which makes everything easier and easier. It\u2019s just important to get as much out of our resources as we possibly can.\u2019","token_len":508,"entropy":[11.5794,4.2901,1.2723,6.5236,0.233,2.4911,7.114,4.5941,7.377,6.6292,1.0772,0.2565,1.1569,0.0352,1.7395,12.6229,2.0325,7.9516,4.353,6.9365,3.002,1.8549,0.5326,7.6395,0.4824,3.3384,6.3621,2.0891,6.8815,4.2108,1.5877,2.7848,5.2658,0.2421,2.2099,5.6554,5.3316,2.4038,0.1554,0.3415,0.4066,16.6734,7.6827,7.2407,0.9712,1.5682,6.0766,0.8479,0.9011,4.2108,1.4268,2.5293,1.1364,2.9804,3.2578,0.5957,6.5443,2.4517,0.8687,1.6648,2.483,1.7746,4.1555,3.5914,5.5884,1.7485,4.9149,4.6993,5.6962,3.4607,1.5676,2.7233,5.4547,3.6251,0.9802,2.298,3.2355,4.5058,3.1201,7.7904,0.092,1.9407,1.4404,0.6151,0.7218,2.2436,3.8446,4.3475,1.7975,1.2675,5.0383,4.4176,4.9004,0.5621,2.6687,16.4006,8.8044,1.8954,1.0145,6.9409,5.903,0.366,0.9823,2.5378,5.7028,1.5291,6.8347,2.2256,1.9184,1.6037,3.068,3.5786,6.0233,0.1412,0.38,4.7312,3.5412,1.3385,1.6091,2.2641,2.0736,1.2558,0.0252,2.1741,1.9015,9.1724,0.7673,3.2828,0.0659,3.0524,1.8637,1.7863,1.2643,4.9965,1.2802,2.5061,1.4439,2.5934,0.9375,0.1528,1.6317,4.0023,6.5078,0.0865,1.7941,5.0548,2.2631,0.4324,0.3934,5.2908,2.3914,6.4817,1.2633,0.4407,1.3362,1.6336,2.0114,5.4973,3.6257,0.0345,2.1012,2.7919,0.0213,0.6121,2.2507,3.063,1.2696,1.3329,5.3022,4.8397,3.9331,1.1129,3.596,2.1378,4.579,4.8626,1.6444,0.3782,2.7876,0.9366,0.7378,2.9203,4.5662,0.8365,4.1319,2.9238,1.1249,3.0553,4.9313,1.0241,5.1748,5.9695,0.8777,3.9453,0.0201,9.7741,0.013,5.3817,2.5529,5.6015,6.5415,1.6452,4.615,2.4481,4.6971,4.1054,7.3243,1.3107,2.0954,4.1764,5.4755,1.164,1.556,0.8539,3.4356,3.1906,1.6661,0.9375,1.3583,3.6259,0.4831,2.4256,7.7096,4.713,1.3968,1.3648,4.4388,0.1514,0.6611,3.8997,2.8131,1.2404,2.1481,5.1825,4.0435,0.0391,5.8137,1.0877,4.3595,1.7559,0.973,0.6305,6.7701,2.2774,2.0551,4.0334,1.0402,4.1249,2.3737,2.0299,7.1389,0.0726,2.4086,0.8822,2.317,5.4484,2.2324,1.8335,4.0292,0.5356,0.7914,0.422,0.0505,1.3102,6.3257,3.2648,0.9399,1.4704,3.4784,5.5117,1.1702,4.0684,0.7907,1.1209,2.6625,0.2416,0.3842,9.8884,0.596,1.7929,0.3713,0.1633,2.5985,1.277,1.6985,3.294,1.4238,5.7227,0.1235,0.2778,0.04,0.4526,2.9791,0.6799,3.2321,0.7235,5.3169,0.5047,8.4338,2.4867,0.6839,4.8781,0.8408,3.0343,9.2294,0.1701,0.3238,7.1584,0.6573,0.5697,3.0678,1.0441,0.0252,0.0321,3.2705,1.9602,2.7176,2.856,2.7393,0.5416,0.0999,0.0712,2.2553,3.1666,1.5145,2.2047,2.2164,3.2326,1.0361,2.0634,1.7115,2.5105,4.0309,1.5205,0.2742,2.9792,0.7398,4.3526,0.0652,0.9574,5.6285,3.3438,3.742,2.7509,1.6392,6.6951,1.1395,0.8876,1.4339,2.8191,4.6932,3.1691,0.0009,0.8242,1.2411,3.4734,0.2771,0.5169,0.3947,0.0195,3.9137,3.3615,0.2968,0.3686,3.3016,0.7217,1.8537,5.728,1.7709,0.3602,1.4488,4.8555,6.1009,1.2889,4.899,2.8366,0.9062,1.0718,7.0422,1.3977,0.5329,4.6392,3.3961,3.0233,1.6365,3.8925,3.3447,0.345,0.3391,1.0405,1.6875,1.8968,6.8912,5.9213,2.7994,0.4746,0.8847,3.9821,8.0763,5.3741,0.4406,1.9679,5.0878,1.4308,2.9122,1.6886,1.9996,3.8756,0.0694,0.1396,0.5869,6.416,1.7061,1.6524,3.8757,0.4172,1.7873,0.7588,8.349,1.6517,0.3719,2.8392,1.3033,0.5955,1.9633,2.3937,3.269,4.5517,4.7688,2.352,7.9056,2.0406,1.0622,1.1966,6.256,1.4531,6.6212,0.1329,2.457,3.3105,4.008,3.3192,3.6213,0.7409,1.1773,1.2393,4.752,1.1894,1.5458,5.0098,5.9863,2.3523,3.0335,0.0106,1.7848,4.1159,0.7979,0.8267,5.5471,0.7512,1.4025,4.6035,5.9938,6.4459,1.101,6.9995,7.3356,3.8622,0.6698,1.2082,0.2172,1.1966,4.2358,6.2042,3.0376,4.3594,0.0308,5.5345,1.704,3.4493,3.8479,5.9405,4.2016,2.6352,1.814,1.2047,2.9984,1.8654,0.0551,0.0112,3.762,5.4693,1.1997,2.3347,4.8897,0.8719,2.8916,0.1067,3.4838,8.1139,0.144,1.474,2.957,0.0363,1.1263,2.4856,0.1273]}

The following are the major items that will affect businesses. The House passed the bill with strong bipartisan support before Senate leaders in their break for the Fourth of July. The measure authorizes the Department of Justice to pay a $400 million settlement to survivors of slavery in the southern states and provides financial aid to victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The bill also allows the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to hire 10,000 temporary workers, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to hire 5,000 more, to help with a wave of eviction proceedings across the country. It authorizes more $16 billion in disaster loans for businesses, and authorizes $1.5 billion in the Emergency Food Assistance Program. Other provisions include $50 million in money for the Department of Health and Human Services, $25 million for the Department of Veteran Affairs, and $45 million for the Environmental Protection Agency. Some provisions do not have budget caps set and are authorized on a discretionary basis but could total up to $1.4 trillion \u2013 the largest bill ever proposed in the U.S. Congress. The Senate on Wednesday approved the measure, and it will likely go to the white house to seek President Obama\u2019s signature. Lawmakers said the measure authorizes enough money for federal agencies, and states and localities, to continue operating until Sept. 30, providing that they can show that all remaining funds have been allocated. If Congress can\u2019t provide additional funding before that, they said that would force more government agencies to close.\nBoris Johnson says 'We know which side of Europe we are on' as he warns European Commission of new Brexit 'dialogue' after weeks of tit-for-tat\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has offered a \u2018huge opportunity' to restart the post-Brexit economic relationship.\n'We will see whether the EU will really listen, what we will see is whether they will actually move towards a dialogue again and not try to intimidate us or threaten us in ways that haven't worked for a long time.\n'And we are keen to give them a huge opportunity from the very beginning to give us a better deal because we know which side of Europe we are on.\n'We are trying to end this terrible mistake in life that we made and we are ready to start again', he said.","token_len":508,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.1615,4.3835,1.7305,1.4582,0.8394,4.7675,3.4957,0.6838,1.8178,5.7077,4.8732,1.2657,0.0891,5.1988,0.0356,5.1358,7.4891,4.4511,4.1999,10.293,5.7825,3.9346,2.8223,0.2308,0.3335,0.391,2.2703,8.4286,4.6726,0.9682,4.7295,3.2745,1.9221,2.2663,4.6712,5.4424,3.5397,3.9101,3.1168,2.695,0.9186,1.3661,2.8843,5.3923,0.6511,0.0824,6.1449,4.6363,2.4657,4.6287,4.9223,7.4577,2.9821,1.3185,8.535,0.0255,0.0006,2.9567,1.6113,4.9029,7.7663,0.0088,0.9028,2.0448,0.0024,2.6368,0.336,5.4259,3.1083,1.2346,5.2716,0.3225,3.2581,0.6791,5.8329,0.183,6.78,2.3637,0.6997,4.2637,0.7758,2.9306,3.4987,4.3906,2.4371,0.415,2.087,0.6096,5.0637,0.883,1.1309,6.6474,0.3644,0.5617,1.0807,1.6527,0.7585,2.6621,0.9123,2.1649,0.0003,0.0044,0.0008,1.6936,0.0005,2.7772,4.6546,1.648,0.0273,0.0342,0.0562,3.2947,4.4347,0.1908,0.0692,3.1906,1.2206,2.8352,2.903,2.6426,1.3945,0.0018,2.5848,0.008,0.0007,0.0015,3.8533,1.6386,3.3445,0.0135,0.2293,4.9129,2.9208,1.1903,1.595,3.0227,4.6573,7.2117,0.0045,6.2419,6.147,4.8915,0.2712,0.3984,0.2416,3.5479,6.4515,0.0011,5.0622,4.8544,5.0523,0.4057,0.4735,5.4926,5.0988,1.7534,4.5509,1.9655,1.9043,6.4497,0.001,1.5478,2.2291,0.7661,1.5811,0.1544,0.6668,5.3949,4.5268,5.6421,1.5865,0.4857,2.2009,5.2463,1.4299,1.4896,2.5029,4.1885,0.5999,1.203,5.0147,0.6839,1.9407,2.3442,0.0055,2.7234,0.1476,0.0008,0.0025,1.6356,0.7261,2.9321,0.0246,0.6035,0.9563,1.0536,0.0013,5.8991,0.5167,0.2782,0.8685,0.2067,4.9627,0.0296,0.4848,0.796,5.0441,0.0098,0.0023,0.2417,5.5119,2.3713,5.2696,0.1031,3.7146,8.5516,2.7382,6.287,3.6067,2.3872,7.6054,4.9685,0.3479,3.6583,0.0307,4.1193,4.2527,8.8383,1.2125,0.0025,0.2338,1.9935,0.5946,2.4856,1.2997,8.1294,2.5192,1.7579,5.8347,2.5172,3.6314,2.0833,1.1915,1.7597,0.0005,0.0022,0.0158,0.7989,0.1743,1.1974,1.6052,5.3387,1.7163,1.066,1.2098,3.2651,1.7847,2.6192,2.2206,1.9213,3.2689,3.3332,0.494,1.2844,11.8298,0.5739,3.4734,7.8587,5.9987,0.845,14.5003,7.4173,0.3471,0.2037,0.6939,7.3107,0.0112,4.606,1.4791,2.6986,8.0593,0.0013,7.2139,0.5622,1.3161,3.7711,0.3525,2.9515,2.4121,5.0619,2.213,0.3192,0.2569,2.8729,0.1366,3.9529,3.1676,3.9195,4.6935,0.0152,0.3042,1.0109,6.355,4.7611,2.2981,2.5742,6.2145,1.1678,5.319,6.0416,1.3676,3.2043,0.1845,3.8803,1.6618,4.5525,2.8687,3.8744,17.7886,2.6524,0.0259,4.3966,4.362,0.5845,4.6176,1.4116,3.5481,2.6929,4.9444,3.898,2.2993,4.9395,5.0971,4.5576,1.7773,0.2482,1.4082,0.9784,2.2203,9.3378,7.035,0.85,4.6293,3.3884,3.8871,5.319,6.7868,2.5474,1.4381,7.3852,1.7053,1.1647,0.0583,0.621,3.8562,1.4212,5.5132,4.6075,5.0726,3.703,5.3745,4.5772,2.9894,9.1932,0.0212,0.2301,4.7093,7.9326,0.0736,9.0687,0.1372,0.0002,0.0048,0.0095,0.0097,3.7982,4.1409,0.6627,0.0044,5.9528,0.0007,2.1123,5.8556,1.7448,16.4969,8.5621,9.0453,7.3921,2.9029,0.4689,6.3338,1.8379,7.0332,0.0275,0.1513,4.8587,1.7619,3.0045,1.2816,2.7408,0.8152,4.3605,3.2637,3.1069,1.7781,2.5382,2.4854,5.4841,3.9799,3.2221,4.7221,1.8173,3.0285,1.738,1.5196,2.5974,2.6208,0.9,3.0431,5.1253,3.0944,0.8717,5.581,7.2013,2.3822,3.8341,3.7909,0.2029,7.3729,0.692,3.2098,3.668,0.1542,3.828,3.7809,0.2403,7.3412,0.0123,1.4049,2.1063,1.6811,0.2891,0.0681,2.0484,0.8789,1.9435,3.2159,1.7908,2.7072,6.58,0.5105,5.4676,1.2438,1.5379,7.1715,0.1389,6.7515,1.3838,3.1187,0.2967,1.2735,4.5473,1.3458,1.0799,2.8755,1.2983,4.4471,1.0704,1.1874,0.4441,0.0414,0.0805,0.4467,0.0564,0.0096,0.0057,1.6129,0.6083,1.1837,1.5711,1.7194,4.3265,0.0959,6.3446,2.5079,5.2987,5.829,3.4077,8.8801,3.0814,1.5135,1.7663,2.2471,1.4726,0.96,4.3412,0.1792,3.2966,3.5556,8.0975,1.0135,0.5829,0.6394]}

The provincial capital of Nueva Ecija, 30km north of Guamil, has been left with water up to waist levels because of flooded sewer pipes, he said.\nMr Richard Gordon of the United Nations Emergency Force said that in Luzon, about 600 schools closed and 7500 teachers and students had to be moved while a further 14,000 students feared being stranded elsewhere owing to landslides and floods that blocked the road linking them to their school.\nMr Gordon said the United Nations was ready to help where and when it could, but \"there will be very little time to get equipment in there.\n\"We're having to plan on a very, very basic level, whether or not there would be a medical clinic or not.\"\nFilipino authorities had urged people to stay away from the low-lying coasts and heeded the official warnings to move to higher ground.\nAt least 14 people have been killed and many injured in the eastern Philippines, but the typhoon continued to move inland into the country.","token_len":509,"entropy":[9.7801,2.1991,3.7477,1.4808,5.4091,5.169,6.4261,2.0841,0.2279,2.9119,0.612,1.12,5.6441,0.3107,8.9997,4.5929,1.0071,1.1431,0.0003,4.4758,3.2862,11.1384,2.9515,0.0378,1.329,10.0009,4.5574,1.9131,0.0311,3.571,0.8131,1.7302,7.1082,0.0956,2.221,9.3983,8.628,2.3087,3.1142,0.2932,11.742,4.0637,2.1463,3.4559,0.0869,2.1891,4.2458,1.7216,1.0237,3.8669,0.5562,4.2349,5.6277,5.7346,2.2571,0.838,2.5715,4.764,4.16,0.0011,0.6075,6.1671,0.3043,0.674,6.7336,5.2725,5.9506,0.1884,1.0456,7.4685,1.4121,2.8522,1.3541,3.7242,2.9329,3.4075,0.0005,0.3816,3.4844,5.2192,5.2077,5.8261,1.0085,2.1194,5.0186,8.993,3.379,0.0077,4.4258,6.9064,2.356,2.6327,1.879,1.9333,3.6134,5.9629,0.8817,0.8183,8.2732,1.1611,0.7024,2.2088,0.9742,0.0735,1.6904,4.3554,0.8429,0.8204,5.0416,1.4025,0.7475,2.9308,3.3889,4.5872,1.8827,6.257,3.8334,2.5057,2.6483,5.3649,4.4702,5.8133,0.3633,3.1074,1.118,1.9896,0.9697,4.3853,0.0149,2.7605,2.6251,1.6,1.9843,1.1775,3.8015,3.07,5.2711,0.7071,2.8072,1.8265,3.3074,7.192,1.851,4.0353,2.7581,2.6006,4.5566,0.2608,2.0445,0.9919,1.3931,2.0766,4.8958,1.7762,3.1211,6.3101,2.2333,0.6034,0.478,3.4939,7.2819,5.2426,4.5518,0.8784,2.9191,4.0156,11.3523,0.0777,0.0428,11.4871,0.8615,3.0959,5.1529,2.0035,3.013,4.9322,4.9605,0.0044,5.1097,5.2852,6.6334,0.1292,2.0912,0.6093,5.6977,0.0506,3.9367,1.0484,6.2749,2.1181,0.0001,5.3847,2.8724,3.2882,3.2633,0.0424,3.3497,0.0067,2.7353,0.3971,3.149,7.8477,3.263,2.8598,2.6323,7.0037,4.6062,3.7569,1.5355,1.3648,0.0077,5.2736,2.0077,0.1533,1.0701,5.0038,0.1303,3.0263,4.0956,4.3713,1.861,0.0694,3.6572,4.9929,7.1587,0.0005,8.2169,3.666,1.6139,4.303,3.0538,3.9547,1.7062,0.4098,0.3035,2.4154,2.9283,7.3576,0.5149,1.5224,3.0681,4.8724,0.8858,0.0624,6.3502,0.9597,7.699,0.5739,2.3445,1.6342,1.3046,0.1911,3.4058,5.7494,4.435,2.5815,0.0073,0.4333,3.4199,1.1307,2.3861,2.1302,0.0927,1.6223,0.4547,6.3346,11.4953,9.3605,0.3454,1.5487,2.5209,0.0075,0.4075,4.833,0.1835,3.3346,7.7947,2.8742,0.1046,6.7193,2.6893,4.1695,0.4296,4.5309,1.0077,3.5709,0.733,5.0636,0.301,9.3348,10.0916,1.6511,2.3444,1.9212,4.6334,0.0278,0.3746,2.6698,0.7048,2.6403,3.3714,5.3253,2.6365,1.5723,4.5035,0.9382,2.3647,5.0527,0.3592,0.0009,1.218,8.8137,1.7168,2.8048,0.333,2.7848,0.0118,0.0867,2.6204,1.0184,4.8635,2.2954,5.8646,7.3808,0.0021,11.0392,4.4729,6.1063,0.1609,7.6298,7.1686,2.3182,1.4592,1.8396,0.1199,0.1917,0.2944,3.3311,11.1726,7.3285,2.9296,0.4439,3.628,0.1306,5.8733,4.5997,0.7353,1.5632,3.7513,5.5302,0.0039,0.9101,3.6043,4.5275,6.0883,4.8944,2.4975,5.6328,5.8886,6.1869,1.4393,2.8678,2.5222,1.1704,0.6566,3.0983,6.9834,3.8559,3.8009,4.85,0.2359,0.1427,2.0959,7.7979,3.6209,5.1913,5.259,8.0173,0.0105,3.6112,0.0031,1.6763,3.5769,2.8483,5.6346,2.0582,2.3052,4.9719,3.3696,0.346,2.0543,2.2473,0.483,0.3711,3.3345,1.4479,0.5625,1.6287,4.7183,0.1204,2.8051,5.6193,0.102,1.6203,8.1812,4.6457,0.4662,2.2935,0.4752,0.8115,0.554,4.2865,2.7356,2.7261,0.4811,4.6842,0.9592,2.5907,1.2339,3.5809,7.878,3.9083,4.158,3.2153,4.3295,0.3091,1.5758,2.5229,5.0962,0.7988,6.4644,4.8324,3.4918,3.3005,3.1249,0.0057,7.3022,3.3217,2.4117,5.6864,4.1476,0.0016,2.4539,5.9029,0.0567,1.9453,6.1578,4.7705,1.6507,4.5832,1.2603,0.373,8.3933,0.014,0.5273,3.3174,3.175,3.8579,1.4576,0.4024,1.4803,1.5099,0.0878,1.1327,8.4234,0.3499,0.0091,7.3667,1.8808,7.7327,1.974,1.572,7.5923,2.5075,3.7084,4.3988,1.8391,4.0306,0.4058,0.8308,0.643,4.8106,0.6453,4.4936,0.3731,1.7425,0.4957,0.3743,0.9959,4.7739,4.5549,0.7274,0.84,6.1518,1.6007,1.1936,4.553,2.0189,3.5826,0.0049,4.8841,0.3258,3.166,2.9789,3.3564,0.6149,4.1904,2.3228]}

Saleh","text":"Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on Saturday called on the Saudi-led coalition to pave the way for an end to nearly three years of war by ceasing attacks and lifting a siege. Saleh\u2019s pleas come ahead of a joint press conference with the UAE ruler, who announced on Saturday a ceasefire agreement with Houthi rebels.\nAt the announcement, Ali Abdallah Saleh called for an end to the armed conflict that has led to the deaths of more than 10,000 people, including thousands of children, and affected more than 21 million others.\n\u201cIf the war ends, the crisis will be resolved, Yemen will be free of conflicts and terrorism, and development will resume with support from the international community,\u201d the former president, who has been exiled by the Houthi rebels to Aden, said.\nSaleh made the comments during a meeting with Abdulmanap Abdulmutallab, the emir of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), an ally of the Houthi rebels that has been warring with the coalition for over three years.\n\u201cThe Houthi rebels are a terrorist group that is bent on committing heinous crimes against innocent civilians, destroying houses and public buildings, killing and maiming people, causing destruction and bloodshed,\u201d Saleh said.\nThe United Nations said it had confirmed that more than 10,000 people have died in Yemen\u2019s conflict in the three-year-long war.\nThe conflict has also seen numerous civilians displaced and famine set in for the first time in the history of the country.\n\u201cI am sending this message to the Yemeni people, and it is coming from my heart,\u201d Saleh said, calling on the Saudi-led coalition to show \u201ccompassion\u201d while the war continues.\n\u201cTo end the war, we need to end the aerial bombing. We also need to stop the sea and land blockade, and we need to end all hostilities.\u201d\nSaleh\u2019s comments came before a joint press conference with the emir of the UAE.\nThe agreement, the first large-scale truce to be reached so far between the rebels and the coalition in conflict-torn Yemen, was announced at a conference of Arab foreign ministers in Abu Dhabi.

{"prompt":"The U.S. military did not kill any civilians when it accompanied Somali forces on a deadly raid in August , U.S. Africa command said late on Wednesday , the first public statement on the findings","text":"The U.S. military did not kill any civilians when it accompanied Somali forces on a deadly raid in August, U.S. Africa command said late on Wednesday, the first public statement on the findings of a United States military report that blamed the Islamist militants for a war-torn region's escalating violence. The report, commissioned by officials with direct responsibility for Africa, said no American troops, including those engaged with Somali military and intelligence units, killed civilians in an August raid on a camp. The raid on the Baidoa area, near the Somalia-Somavia border, killed at least 90 civilians and injured hundreds, the report said. \"These operations were clearly, unequivocally and correctly undertaken in support of our legitimate objective to protect civilians from armed opposition in the southern region,\" the report said. The report said, \"there was no indication of any misuse of force or civilian casualties among military personnel assigned to this mission.\" The report also said the American forces had no information showing foreign forces had been involved in the killing civilians. But the report's conclusions were limited to the Baidoa raid. There had been reports of military operations in eastern Somalia targeting the militant Islamist group al-Shabab - but the United States Government did not identify which forces were involved in those missions.\nSomalia's former president Mohamed Abdullahi Musevrud (above) says he will return home to Mogadishu to seek peace and unity within Somalia's transitional government. Speaking to reporters after he left the United States on Monday with his family to avoid facing charges of terrorism and money laundering in Mogadishu, Mr Musevrud, who is set to run for president next year, said he wanted to return to Somalia because that country was too far gone to recover without him. \"Somalia cannot be restored unless the perpetrators of violence who caused this nation to fall know that their actions have been recorded and will be prosecuted at some future date, \" he said. Mr Musevrud had been scheduled to appear in Washington on Tuesday before a Senate committee, and a hearing with the committee is not expected before his trip. He left the United States with his younger brother and two children after they were warned by officials they would face arrest if they stayed in Washington. Mr Musevrud, who is not in Somalia because he has requested international protection, said he would seek reconciliation among Somalis. \"Under the present situation, the reconciliation that I wish for could come in form of negotiations or it could just be in form of dialogue,\" he said.","token_len":510,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,2.7372,5.1856,0.4102,6.0402,2.7193,2.1764,4.4774,0.869,9.8664,6.484,1.7343,1.5758,1.0182,4.5213,3.0733,0.9929,3.642,2.346,4.336,0.002,0.048,0.0042,9.3071,8.2499,1.7976,5.121,1.7652,1.969,2.1379,3.5238,1.3722,4.5492,3.0332,1.7455,0.2879,6.4735,0.7192,1.276,4.8804,2.6608,2.1131,4.4673,2.3272,4.6379,0.9405,5.3278,2.0868,0.7345,3.0517,5.5563,3.1927,0.4184,2.7748,4.9553,7.2319,0.9362,0.189,2.9163,1.8083,1.3955,4.2658,0.2328,7.4826,3.999,7.7468,1.7306,0.0185,5.6088,1.6955,1.7582,5.2351,2.3077,1.1735,4.5323,1.252,2.6985,5.5081,3.9356,1.5705,3.8536,3.846,1.6905,3.553,0.1371,2.4298,1.4843,1.3847,4.4799,5.0741,1.6034,1.3189,0.6017,4.6739,4.5323,1.5656,4.9593,4.2114,0.6816,7.0269,5.3019,0.0703,4.7395,1.4784,3.2011,0.9033,4.9866,0.6876,5.1017,0.0041,17.4992,0.0333,0.1142,0.9038,1.3496,0.0001,5.6205,2.309,1.2611,1.844,3.1112,1.7302,0.8649,1.3015,0.1019,0.115,3.2514,4.2409,4.7365,1.2977,5.1795,6.1494,3.1256,1.08,5.9555,4.8585,2.8883,2.9967,0.0021,3.4163,5.3127,4.1557,1.965,2.5171,1.4134,1.6297,3.8057,4.2939,3.9069,1.6643,4.9009,2.5464,1.4041,0.8286,1.2931,0.1315,0.1312,1.4101,1.9555,1.6995,4.5322,1.7187,5.4454,1.1417,0.4895,3.1112,1.2324,1.646,8.3085,0.1197,0.761,1.7645,5.282,0.1373,5.1104,4.0654,0.8096,6.3536,0.1613,2.9717,0.6766,0.7165,1.228,2.0586,1.9077,0.5795,1.587,4.5269,2.2612,2.3402,3.2329,4.2548,6.0909,7.7617,2.1986,1.1296,2.5023,0.8086,0.1197,1.0237,3.7292,8.7447,0.5419,4.0906,1.4211,1.8362,3.2749,3.2305,1.7123,5.651,0.7839,1.7577,2.1611,0.0409,0.0013,1.8131,1.9031,4.9681,3.2965,0.0774,4.3372,0.8613,4.7515,3.0999,1.321,5.3651,0.3652,5.1478,2.4636,5.1935,4.563,0.2006,1.4859,0.1016,0.102,0.4198,0.0034,7.3393,3.3293,1.3055,3.0134,0.1656,7.4111,2.7509,0.0337,3.1405,2.5126,4.3838,1.1114,0.5442,0.8996,3.409,5.0898,0.3528,2.7621,8.8867,0.1665,0.1314,0.8494,4.9444,1.5149,2.7883,0.5548,0.828,8.9039,21.8343,4.8442,5.1939,5.7548,0.4863,3.8741,1.9368,2.6803,4.7224,2.8526,1.0916,3.5899,0.0,0.0008,2.2962,3.1839,2.9485,2.5537,5.3235,5.7371,1.5915,1.0428,5.5978,0.0509,1.4967,5.7774,1.058,1.6607,1.9437,3.3245,1.6388,1.7047,3.2681,0.2347,1.2755,2.6892,6.2355,1.3278,1.5433,4.3329,4.8922,6.2337,3.0307,1.6099,2.2696,3.5979,5.7564,0.0398,2.3134,3.2386,0.0001,0.0022,0.0994,2.4337,0.7273,0.5645,0.0004,2.988,0.9797,1.7362,6.216,0.0072,4.8685,0.2872,1.344,2.0419,0.1945,0.1063,0.5242,0.877,3.3976,0.4669,1.9602,0.6714,0.8376,3.0493,6.224,1.3403,1.9633,4.3513,3.6525,2.9715,1.0337,6.1248,7.0274,3.4224,0.2512,2.0828,4.9618,0.0232,0.0324,4.3527,1.4231,4.9166,5.0995,2.4045,5.6286,0.7901,3.7172,4.2775,5.2865,2.1608,6.6209,1.2824,1.4896,7.6624,1.5638,2.4613,2.2872,1.8909,1.5824,7.2252,1.1747,2.9377,0.3774,3.4525,5.8751,5.1744,1.3011,0.5599,3.2133,5.6565,0.3041,0.1409,0.1679,2.2606,0.0425,0.0368,0.0004,4.1668,1.9827,3.8043,0.0642,3.006,1.0184,3.5582,0.6312,1.3475,3.395,1.4783,1.6128,0.9293,3.2101,3.3529,3.7271,4.0417,4.4844,1.5913,2.9938,3.6232,5.2033,0.3571,4.7538,3.4586,3.8983,1.905,2.3313,5.1662,1.4755,1.0986,0.0031,4.1485,1.3682,7.4165,0.2561,2.8736,2.7626,2.605,2.5657,4.0567,0.8654,7.4487,1.6051,4.7641,2.9748,1.1476,0.8177,4.0384,1.0021,0.2391,5.5764,0.9346,5.6001,0.6092,2.4962,0.137,0.0437,0.0005,1.9859,0.7966,1.7573,3.9573,3.2972,1.7312,5.5371,1.3323,1.7085,5.8411,7.3544,1.1766,0.3657,1.3867,0.5838,2.2112,3.3328,5.1894,4.9415,4.1917,0.0232,2.3112,1.337,7.6124,1.3973,3.6287,2.6746,0.4164,2.3118,5.5261,3.8986,1.6111,4.6042,1.1665,5.7396,4.1169,3.7588,6.1924,0.0264,4.7555,3.9093,5.757,0.1603,4.6226,0.4,4.8655,3.9946,0.0032,4.9023,0.9331,0.2165,0.218,0.2509]}

Patty Murray of Washington State, of not being \u201cfarsighted\u201d after praising him in a recent op-ed column for taking a \u201cmoral\u201d stance against marijuana. Also, the president said he wanted the commission to make no recommendations.\n\u201cI do not believe you, and I have my doubts about other people in similar positions with respect to the opioid epidemic, would make that recommendation,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe bottom line is, this is no longer a national policy initiative. It is time for the states to step up.\u201d\nThe president also promised to create a commission to address his administration\u2019s efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. His administration has worked with states to curb the supply of opioids through banning doctors from participating in the opioid business, but has taken little action to curb demand.\nIn a tweet earlier Saturday, Trump said he would propose a commission to address the growing crisis and that it would have the job of deciding on what action the government would take.\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting together an independent report with a clear and well-funded plan to combat opioid addiction,\u201d he said, but he did not provide details on the proposed commission. \u201cAnd \u2026 every action or idea that is beneficial to the public I will consider with no hesitation,\u201d he said.\nTrump also told a rally for his campaign in Pennsylvania to be held Monday that he wanted Congress to allow the Justice Department to \u201ctake ownership of it.\u201d A few days ago, in an interview with the Washington Post, Trump said he wanted the administration\u2019s new federal task force on the epidemic to \u201chave the authority to do\u201d something about it.\nOne month ago, a bipartisan commission made recommendations to combat the opioid epidemic and Trump promised to take action. One of the more important recommendations was to expand use of the federally banned drug naloxone \u2014 a drug that could save lives by reversing the effects of an overdose \u2014 to doctors, pharmacists and medical students.\nThe president said Saturday the recommendation, which he said he supports, did not come from any top federal official.","token_len":510,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,5.3949,0.9123,6.6876,0.7753,6.8768,0.659,4.8738,6.6659,0.0032,0.0042,0.6236,10.5226,0.3082,2.6044,5.2376,2.7214,2.0749,1.909,8.4437,0.8224,4.6884,5.5738,0.7717,4.4216,0.3151,4.9782,3.6799,0.1408,5.7769,1.1799,2.3301,3.0105,3.9587,0.4244,2.2074,7.8087,6.1093,2.8522,3.6449,1.2295,2.4357,3.5436,5.5383,3.0514,6.5443,2.3182,1.4847,0.9807,0.0128,3.2241,0.3711,0.2181,16.6968,1.2332,2.1288,1.0822,1.9345,6.5281,0.5434,0.3463,16.5467,9.0467,3.3837,2.789,0.1491,2.3999,0.0009,3.9358,0.0019,2.3938,0.0117,5.889,0.2835,0.2743,3.557,2.5165,14.9533,5.3771,5.6329,6.82,0.0074,0.005,2.0972,7.3158,5.4036,8.4437,3.7347,3.0672,1.1749,2.5421,4.8111,0.0393,0.0037,5.5029,1.3075,3.7629,1.6956,13.272,0.5797,7.897,5.9206,1.3447,3.08,2.855,5.4624,0.9025,9.0988,1.1787,2.5104,1.9254,1.5834,1.7841,3.538,2.4288,0.6571,0.1823,4.4819,5.5398,2.6765,2.6539,0.2524,5.1245,1.1594,5.8256,4.1904,0.6922,1.5245,4.8659,3.5931,3.589,0.555,2.4226,5.2483,2.4739,1.3971,7.2031,1.6891,4.2136,5.8423,1.1666,4.7857,2.8239,0.0317,1.8902,1.6507,1.053,0.9257,5.0283,3.539,3.4888,0.8127,2.5135,5.0736,4.8051,4.1718,0.6057,0.6501,4.7581,0.4725,3.9244,5.6408,0.0026,0.2177,1.1359,3.3545,0.7238,5.6523,2.5262,0.9066,3.3279,5.0977,5.8023,1.0502,1.3181,0.9719,5.5716,0.6878,1.3461,3.5221,0.3305,3.6474,0.197,2.8124,3.3671,3.6643,0.5401,2.1639,2.7856,1.9605,3.9108,0.5323,4.977,0.4607,1.6688,0.5223,3.4146,5.0234,2.415,4.5425,1.2695,0.2758,4.198,0.0579,2.6325,1.4422,1.4236,0.488,0.8485,5.2416,1.8696,1.3013,5.1385,1.7312,2.0036,0.5158,4.6496,1.3047,4.0129,0.2601,0.808,3.9142,10.2304,5.181,0.2784,6.4116,0.0833,1.9204,3.266,7.1709,1.5061,2.3917,1.4997,5.0884,3.4374,0.2597,0.7328,2.7193,5.3048,1.5089,0.4965,2.5913,1.261,3.895,4.1881,4.1538,0.2143,0.2829,1.0632,1.1464,1.2326,5.1789,1.5091,3.0953,0.5153,1.3044,0.6891,4.928,3.7881,2.9224,3.5524,1.7916,0.6462,4.4629,2.7321,8.0896,0.094,3.6702,2.6046,3.0571,2.9388,3.2148,2.3466,3.6521,0.0377,1.1806,0.5048,2.6125,0.795,2.9756,9.5934,5.3121,3.7925,5.7585,1.473,2.8888,3.2544,4.6623,4.0676,2.4916,5.3328,3.8259,5.0194,0.2762,4.2456,3.674,1.133,2.3278,1.8249,0.9624,2.0159,2.2509,1.5384,1.6191,0.3669,2.8553,2.756,2.3851,1.8429,0.0438,2.5577,0.8879,1.6154,1.7174,3.9443,1.6954,0.2813,5.5234,0.1857,3.8193,8.9978,7.6298,5.5639,6.1579,6.4551,1.0211,2.3057,9.5944,0.639,0.931,1.7379,7.1194,1.0929,2.7912,3.6598,6.0014,3.4223,2.1025,0.4076,0.7595,0.5095,0.5842,0.1736,0.3158,2.5675,1.8779,4.0891,3.0107,2.6269,6.3521,1.8623,2.0006,1.221,4.8359,4.9158,3.6485,1.3754,3.5915,1.5914,0.7101,2.9613,4.4314,0.0747,6.3476,1.7537,3.9075,0.0129,0.1181,10.1659,0.2265,3.0831,5.7225,0.8722,5.2084,1.0903,5.6425,1.9369,5.1296,4.0803,0.6462,1.9949,0.0877,4.636,1.3623,0.6051,0.2401,2.1485,2.2312,0.1906,0.2131,0.5549,0.6621,0.6952,1.4862,1.7325,4.5689,5.2525,0.3167,0.13,5.7565,6.0294,4.0171,0.0123,1.7076,2.064,2.4076,0.155,7.3452,0.0566,4.4422,1.3968,1.6972,0.1754,3.5747,10.1667,4.1326,7.7674,1.0369,0.4129,0.3376,0.4152,5.6733,6.5162,0.8105,0.0454,3.1375,3.0688,0.9179,5.1365,1.7527,1.0035,4.637,0.7615,1.1183,0.2236,2.1582,5.6246,3.4958,0.3714,2.6846,0.6466,1.0934,5.2337,0.7165,0.4909,5.4691,2.8591,0.4936,0.9432,0.933,4.4625,6.3703,0.0674,2.4955,5.6103,6.1507,3.9509,3.0916,0.0038,0.0,0.0001,4.3823,1.7939,1.7436,0.5674,4.4935,4.1053,0.1897,1.9724,5.2271,1.7006,1.6414,0.0317,3.745,0.2744,2.0095,1.2006,5.1691,2.0103,3.1099,0.0013,0.4405,4.6666,2.2228,0.5894,0.7425,1.9973,3.0994,1.9031,6.6276,3.6829,4.6087,4.0272,0.9353,1.3763,1.2226,1.4715,6.1197,0.2505,5.1543,0.0969,1.8984,0.3277,3.5051,5.5901,2.7168,0.4334,1.032]}

The appointment in question, however, is not appropriate given he is appointed by the President, not confirmed by the Senate, and he is not acting for the CFPB, but rather for President Trump\u2019s budget director, Mr. Mick Mulvaney,\u201d the judge wrote in a 13-page order.\n\u201cConsumers can trust the independent regulatory body created under the leadership of its predecessor. With that in mind, I am satisfied that the permanent Director of the CFPB should come from the ranks of the CFPB staff. If such a permanent Director of the CFPB is confirmed by the Senate within the four-week period, I am satisfied that the temporary appointment of Secretary Wilbur Ross should be over,\u201d he wrote.\nCFPB President Kathy Kraninger has maintained that she will stay on, but the judge\u2019s decision means she is no longer in control. Trump appointed another Trump appointee to lead the agency, with the Senate vote to confirm or not scheduled for Wednesday.\nThe judges opinion came days after Trump threatened to abolish the CFPB, accusing it of being \u201csomething out of a far-left radical organization.\u201d But the agency said that the president\u2019s orders were \u201cnot actionable\u201d since he could not shut down the agency.","token_len":510,"entropy":[6.9563,0.6281,0.0806,0.0846,4.2011,0.2886,2.6004,2.6269,1.841,4.8218,0.0133,5.3584,0.8643,0.0037,1.4113,1.6294,3.9786,0.8408,0.4508,3.6453,1.74,1.7938,4.8382,0.3654,0.0753,1.3755,4.3544,0.0004,0.0033,0.2108,9.4168,4.7567,4.2706,2.0324,6.4718,8.401,0.01,5.6888,0.4983,0.0025,0.0008,0.0004,0.0,0.1295,5.8818,0.8372,0.3552,0.6732,0.1403,15.4012,2.1687,2.1241,1.8164,2.8305,0.0009,0.0007,2.4677,5.6658,0.6658,1.9732,5.6465,0.2431,5.4968,3.0783,6.3326,2.5651,1.9374,2.1521,0.3412,3.6435,4.9327,4.627,1.266,3.1209,2.0598,0.9361,0.4672,2.8591,2.6512,7.1037,0.7462,4.1492,0.4189,4.7121,0.0208,0.0001,0.0063,2.9197,0.0088,0.0038,0.0008,11.0061,0.9099,5.1681,3.7184,1.8384,8.3634,6.9884,0.7457,3.6104,0.271,4.6108,1.9718,1.0995,0.6118,0.2314,12.3111,8.9015,9.0687,5.1675,0.747,13.4441,7.8037,1.2894,3.6603,0.7155,7.1972,2.0842,5.6813,6.161,6.6928,0.2687,1.7092,0.4414,6.8562,8.5784,2.3598,6.0111,0.8704,2.1946,1.0158,6.3849,6.7855,3.8745,1.7933,4.4703,1.6037,1.8097,9.0734,4.875,2.8738,2.3523,2.1982,1.5612,2.478,5.6281,5.3292,0.7943,2.427,2.2913,6.0724,3.6612,0.6626,0.8233,3.9476,0.0028,0.0004,2.8778,8.8562,6.9555,7.4373,0.0016,0.0007,0.7928,0.567,0.2885,6.0764,2.2925,0.0029,0.004,4.0215,1.9158,0.9959,0.2127,8.5479,5.8579,0.0902,0.0048,4.7593,0.8522,2.0306,2.1056,2.0832,2.0742,0.9898,0.0028,4.2066,2.393,3.9809,4.9112,3.8208,0.0035,2.8738,4.4256,1.805,4.3606,0.5942,4.2251,5.3555,1.4987,0.6118,0.4609,0.9713,3.7323,3.5955,1.3614,0.5125,0.9707,0.3623,0.4067,2.0901,0.3288,4.4647,6.6972,2.2762,4.4148,0.082,0.2153,0.0051,0.0023,1.5797,5.3887,1.3409,3.352,0.0252,3.8924,2.0615,0.0046,0.7462,1.7638,0.1407,1.5813,6.7578,2.9715,3.2561,0.9719,3.1317,4.9921,6.4237,1.5614,2.6398,3.9521,0.0135,1.5266,1.958,7.3745,3.2048,5.5812,1.522,5.5932,0.6603,0.9793,1.7831,1.8825,3.9398,6.1674,0.1368,0.54,0.1012,1.3993,0.771,2.0685,1.476,1.3248,5.1539,3.6362,0.5958,3.0976,0.0014,0.0007,2.1533,4.5381,1.597,1.0681,4.7231,0.4233,4.7686,0.6516,0.0222,4.0398,2.5352,1.1866,4.5942,0.0029,5.5466,0.0005,0.0121,0.0014,1.9082,1.321,1.5456,2.6091,0.6846,2.2112,1.6231,1.9846,5.1534,0.023,0.3169,3.2871,0.4147,0.1943,0.7837,0.0644,6.6584,0.0398,3.4535,4.0971,1.3494,5.1774,5.7034,2.2925,4.5538,3.1001,0.5877,7.6187,0.0244,5.8921,3.6685,3.1638,5.2369,2.164,1.9539,0.0958,0.033,1.9066,2.3972,2.9764,0.3563,1.0639,7.9523,5.2493,1.079,0.2086,0.4109,0.0016,0.0005,4.448,6.5453,1.8194,0.8125,5.5024,0.0412,0.7039,2.1357,0.0315,0.0023,4.0961,1.6542,4.3187,5.3467,0.5109,3.41,2.8944,1.9917,0.1135,0.0959,0.0008,0.0011,1.5086,3.9493,1.5268,0.0694,0.1459,6.6098,1.4402,6.6453,0.429,0.1913,1.1181,0.9956,2.082,2.3029,1.1541,0.3035,0.9673,4.2203,3.5117,1.0602,5.515,2.4826,0.0017,0.025,2.5395,0.6477,6.5317,3.2356,0.9334,0.8818,4.3154,0.3875,0.249,0.173,6.7022,0.3698,0.0017,4.4747,7.6881,3.5802,5.9083,12.2619,3.6013,5.9109,0.5452,1.9501,1.4134,3.9896,1.0444,2.5403,1.6517,2.5135,2.0243,9.3686,2.1136,0.0299,1.6815,3.4436,2.2508,2.4379,2.5613,0.0027,2.1065,4.3675,1.9706,5.5812,4.6827,7.1887,5.4041,0.7056,0.0029,1.7026,2.6592,0.1444,0.8782,0.9691,5.6785,1.4354,5.4504,4.6068,2.459,1.1153,4.5571,3.9149,9.2115,0.8372,3.0761,0.4857,0.4747,2.212,5.0246,7.855,3.3105,4.4703,0.1211,2.1162,3.5645,0.2214,6.6947,0.3972,1.3324,0.0025,0.0011,1.6289,4.9866,0.6459,0.0255,1.3936,16.0151,1.9874,8.7254,3.8862,0.0081,1.3445,6.5298,2.7579,1.716,5.2181,6.3846,0.7471,4.8646,3.7293,4.3376,1.5305,4.0224,5.0412,2.3562,2.1125,3.1275,3.7444,0.0543,0.0028,7.0721,2.2807,8.4941,0.1708,2.4991,7.1557,0.0627,1.7693,1.4886,6.1697,2.7684,4.022,0.5248,6.7116,0.3638,0.3875,0.4796,1.814]}

As a result, the average U.S. tax rate for singles and married households is expected to rise to 37.8%, according to estimates published Thursday by Treasury Department officials. Tax experts estimate such an increase would lead to about $ 3,000 of higher home prices in the U.S. by 2025.\nMeanwhile, the tax reform proposal also foresees some benefits, including higher tax relief for taxpayers and a reduced level of complexity for taxpayers and businesses. As a result, the tax proposal would lead to an overall net tax benefit for households with adjusted gross income up to $ 400,000 and $ 400,000 for singles.\nTrump\u2019s proposed tax law is meant to provide $ 2.9 trillion in cuts in federal taxes and spending. However, even if the tax bill passes, it is unclear how much taxpayers get out of it. This is because many of the proposed tax cuts will be earmarked for certain areas like the military and national security, which means they will have a disproportionate impact on higher-income taxpayers. Meanwhile, the reduction is also expected to reduce payroll taxes for businesses, since the USTR said it is expected to raise the corporate rate from 21% to as high as 35%.\nHowever, experts said that although the tax bill provides only marginal marginal tax relief, it also helps households avoid taxes on the current tax debt, which they claim can have a more significant impact on home values. According to a recent report by HBR, around 70% of taxpayers have more than $100,000 in taxes and mortgages and have only marginal tax rates. As a result, the cost of tax debt is already an additional expense for households. This is particularly true for those with young children because they have a higher chance of going into work during the coronavirus outbreak, as well as the possibility that they may be paying back higher student loan interest rates.\nThe new tax bill also includes tax relief programs for families that have children, according to the USTR. It also proposes a new tax refund process for households with low adjusted net household income, which can be up to $ 12,000.","token_len":511,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,6.6636,7.499,5.9902,6.5643,2.6062,3.0312,4.2805,9.4452,3.8187,1.3948,2.0408,3.2525,0.0018,8.5475,2.546,0.5278,1.9817,6.9324,4.9796,4.1232,1.7267,0.6867,3.3738,2.6192,2.7834,5.4452,2.1999,1.4251,1.4113,1.7378,3.5491,5.1153,2.3166,2.2303,0.5118,20.3956,1.6547,3.9802,3.9505,5.4076,1.8439,0.8062,2.5652,0.0449,1.9098,5.1991,12.0875,1.5751,2.6528,3.694,6.608,0.3603,3.4768,6.1381,1.9899,1.177,2.0132,2.9207,0.1593,0.0845,1.7019,0.0988,1.8986,0.0281,0.8877,0.7099,3.0968,2.714,2.2117,3.2113,0.933,2.1444,3.7146,0.0491,0.4939,1.2768,4.8829,1.5201,0.1964,0.164,1.6367,3.0346,2.7535,0.0003,0.0011,0.0045,2.9317,0.3305,1.5017,5.9655,1.4106,2.2264,5.2297,1.8194,3.076,0.003,1.5702,1.3923,3.6025,0.1631,2.2947,0.7488,2.6125,0.0025,4.3959,4.4231,3.9834,0.1872,5.8769,1.499,2.4707,0.1514,5.5435,3.8894,3.2746,5.4383,2.6389,0.111,0.6542,4.2837,0.0587,3.6146,0.7166,11.7401,3.7395,0.8372,3.0306,5.7069,4.77,1.6005,1.9308,0.8908,2.1914,0.0004,0.0009,0.467,2.3096,2.3049,0.7109,0.1824,17.4672,0.0193,1.7289,3.8149,2.3682,2.5792,3.2807,8.1026,0.5448,0.0003,4.0353,5.5392,2.9328,0.7197,3.5491,2.9268,5.504,0.3021,5.5297,3.8761,2.0436,4.4616,6.9438,0.0051,8.049,0.9169,2.8927,3.3927,1.5539,0.4134,4.876,1.3699,0.1697,0.1041,1.2936,2.2278,4.3066,1.3046,6.4872,0.0874,2.8253,3.1029,4.1877,2.7814,4.8423,1.7494,2.6248,1.953,4.6057,0.0045,0.1319,4.4016,0.0379,0.2297,10.0018,0.0695,0.0116,2.7298,2.3599,3.1005,0.0031,0.0098,0.6018,4.8551,2.3677,0.4894,10.929,14.2654,9.9651,1.9996,2.5258,1.168,6.7511,2.7228,5.4202,0.0621,3.5909,4.9503,3.9663,0.4021,2.9116,0.2785,0.6036,4.0332,2.2847,2.1911,2.3282,2.316,3.405,3.2574,3.3963,0.0038,5.3797,1.8913,1.162,1.8947,1.8461,1.4833,0.6611,1.4148,2.6655,2.786,0.7283,0.7734,7.4743,8.2045,1.4458,0.0911,0.9705,0.4119,5.9442,1.7643,1.398,2.7502,1.4437,0.3713,3.3386,1.8779,0.9917,2.0115,1.3807,5.4687,0.0007,0.2266,5.4662,4.0558,4.6265,1.903,4.4494,1.0369,5.9669,1.2274,1.021,2.1358,5.0649,2.1728,0.9555,2.8928,2.8136,3.3876,0.1786,0.1213,4.6766,0.7317,0.1661,1.5171,0.3995,6.6757,0.0029,1.5066,6.2379,4.4245,4.0025,2.178,0.0065,3.2706,6.5206,0.3503,1.0868,3.336,1.1925,4.6879,1.9944,7.6969,6.3273,4.9062,1.7413,2.8198,2.946,0.0727,2.8064,2.5647,3.0885,2.0189,0.8504,5.5657,0.4406,0.1059,7.6066,1.5012,0.0054,2.4084,0.5272,0.3422,4.2801,0.004,4.6636,2.4077,1.4817,5.5316,0.9837,1.7249,1.5951,5.1246,5.3047,5.4174,5.6345,0.7463,1.2577,0.9276,0.6277,2.0318,5.4507,4.7022,3.9688,4.0677,2.0194,2.5904,7.2247,3.2991,7.6234,2.0238,0.7983,3.5434,5.4885,4.2228,5.2891,0.9138,6.525,2.3519,0.4916,0.1564,5.2967,1.437,0.6979,4.0333,0.0009,2.1286,2.1572,1.4464,0.603,6.9282,3.5694,1.2174,6.6021,4.0073,0.1253,0.0083,4.5099,3.4875,4.2433,0.2312,0.2036,2.4652,0.0724,0.0015,0.1344,6.0835,3.0641,6.7731,3.4345,5.0313,4.9316,7.8339,1.1444,4.2136,4.6466,4.3405,0.4092,0.0375,0.0287,2.0323,4.4511,0.1531,4.7875,6.0121,1.4407,4.0868,5.4046,4.5761,4.5553,0.5139,2.2631,1.6401,4.7131,1.7705,2.2745,0.6224,0.5288,2.4097,1.6145,5.4021,0.2146,5.3004,1.972,2.4641,2.457,0.8633,3.7662,0.0427,4.2585,0.9345,5.0709,3.6654,0.3346,17.819,9.527,1.4455,1.7307,1.6861,3.274,0.6548,0.0139,2.8667,4.8564,1.5853,1.334,1.8212,1.7885,4.3675,5.1252,5.2262,5.0582,0.8001,0.9933,1.6116,0.8676,0.3825,2.4144,4.5019,1.4491,1.679,1.166,1.7759,3.9934,2.1916,6.7058,1.0506,3.5916,2.4048,1.9268,3.0358,2.0156,5.0236,0.002,1.094,6.3783,0.0411,0.3761,3.825,0.7616,4.136,1.6433,3.0257,2.0472,5.8384,5.9652,0.9556,4.0215,1.4734,4.5093,5.2818,6.8535,5.543,0.2506,1.7252,1.42,4.2145,1.3311,4.0016,0.0018,0.6539,5.2009,0.14,0.6114,1.8566]}

Tuesday \u2019 s upset win by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama, coupled with last month \u2019 s Democratic sweep in Virginia, has prompted the question of whether the Republican Party \u2019 s dominance in America is long term.\nTrump and Jones, an outspoken opponent of Trump and a former congressional aide, competed in one of the most significant Tuesday primary elections thus far in the contest. In Georgia, an influential swing state and home to the Republican National Convention in two years, Republican Brian Kemp narrowly lost to Joe Biden by less than seven hundred votes in a tighter race than expected.\nThe Republicans took back control of the House of Representatives for the first time in history, sending the GOP a strong message that it can recover at a time when the incumbent Democrats have struggled for political traction. Donald Trump has long called Georgia home, and the battle to reclaim both chambers of Congress could be the biggest test of the Republican strategy.\nIn many ways, it has proven to be a classic blue state for Democrats, but even so, it could be a test for the Trump administration. Trump \u2019 s campaign is still considering whether they should push for another impeachment, but they may be tempted to move on quickly with Biden in the White House after just three months in office. Despite the disappointing performance in the South, in a big blow to Trump, Trump \u2019 s election campaign now has a bigger gap than expected to take the seat of Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan was a key backer of Trump, but he has been a major critic of Donald Trump since the election. He called Trump a \u201cbully\u201d and \u201cbigot\u201d, who has attacked minorities and others who oppose his views.\nTrump supporters have taken to social media criticising his actions, with many accusing Mr Trump \u2019 s son Donald Trump Jr, who is also engaged in an impeachment inquiry, of working through lawyers to obstruct the probe. Another Republican, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, has said he would not be \u201cintervening\u201d and supported a new impeachment.\nTrump also received praise from one of his advisers as the Republicans reclaimed the House of Representatives. The New York Post, which is owned by a family close to The Times, said a Republican friend told him that Trump has \u201c done a real damn good job of turning this country \u201d. The Trump family has tried to distance itself from the president, but he has consistently criticised his wife, Melania.","token_len":511,"entropy":[12.7383,3.3607,4.5477,9.6748,3.5549,2.9269,2.249,2.3436,6.0315,1.2437,9.5655,16.7426,9.1645,8.8444,8.761,5.1034,2.9623,4.6121,3.0658,0.0938,2.2736,0.7032,2.4479,5.7248,0.003,6.3265,2.2399,5.4385,0.3185,3.2406,4.704,5.6507,0.86,2.7224,0.8966,3.2801,5.0175,2.4923,4.2043,0.9352,0.7415,1.1599,3.4137,0.2902,7.7962,0.2865,0.483,8.0327,1.0112,5.0133,2.1605,6.5166,4.2837,0.9724,1.8929,16.7859,3.4982,3.2758,2.9179,5.8045,3.5501,3.0517,0.0605,3.4929,2.2377,2.4572,2.6471,6.6315,2.6645,0.6207,8.3561,1.8902,4.9518,0.4716,0.2181,0.869,4.1903,8.8493,3.5811,2.5514,8.684,0.0026,1.581,1.2524,6.7557,1.8101,2.9941,5.2476,0.3204,4.9114,6.7037,3.435,0.0794,4.1561,1.2504,0.1764,1.4904,2.6418,1.9819,1.5128,2.8067,10.2009,2.1006,0.1616,3.9045,8.0583,2.5767,4.3688,1.4676,0.8845,7.712,1.0639,3.0791,4.3147,0.0008,6.1168,7.9241,0.088,2.117,1.0026,8.8474,0.8007,1.3128,4.1728,0.3065,1.142,2.297,5.847,4.6242,4.1342,2.3976,0.1093,0.5353,1.4734,1.2817,0.0872,3.8009,0.2924,0.1453,0.0019,0.8579,3.6834,1.8097,6.3744,2.6003,3.28,4.1714,4.4017,3.718,0.8006,1.3421,2.8159,7.4837,5.9863,2.0787,1.3099,0.2974,1.4605,6.8895,3.672,1.8342,4.5521,3.8715,4.8113,3.1815,0.6402,6.4895,0.0348,2.4763,4.834,4.1476,5.3816,3.5857,1.048,1.0958,2.4254,6.0625,2.706,3.0453,6.6152,1.9803,0.9529,0.4649,3.8224,1.3944,2.2503,2.7195,2.6569,1.0695,1.3729,2.0819,6.7473,2.4169,0.5449,2.9303,5.5639,0.1751,0.1108,2.6335,2.815,5.5706,1.2734,0.0242,0.8669,5.9414,6.7137,0.7186,2.557,2.6472,2.0365,4.3061,4.0243,2.6906,0.208,1.6405,4.0038,1.2624,0.9761,3.0702,1.0977,1.2272,2.7563,2.0126,0.7817,3.1995,7.1252,0.0961,0.4444,3.7336,2.8178,4.4998,5.725,1.6835,7.1502,1.7238,4.669,1.4644,5.8306,7.9651,3.125,2.9207,3.1007,3.2561,1.8804,4.1021,0.3553,4.6422,1.4869,5.6045,4.3062,9.0421,3.6358,0.9827,2.0269,0.0007,5.5668,6.2503,2.3681,0.937,1.1465,0.1227,0.2237,6.1048,1.357,7.4323,2.1508,2.0013,2.3948,2.5511,0.3241,5.1674,2.7963,6.0635,5.3354,0.4232,2.013,1.5192,4.281,1.5818,0.0236,0.0269,4.5992,3.8619,5.2314,1.7152,1.3017,4.9076,8.2448,2.32,3.2854,2.751,4.3994,3.7244,4.7182,3.0266,5.7997,0.5459,0.0103,0.0102,5.0077,0.053,1.0219,0.9235,5.7871,1.6298,0.0542,0.0685,3.9124,2.5009,2.9427,4.0593,0.0937,1.3743,2.974,2.2163,1.582,1.6345,2.0157,2.6717,4.2599,3.1437,0.0542,6.3646,0.0221,2.7011,1.4506,1.2962,0.4448,2.939,5.2699,1.4796,0.7869,13.4348,4.0301,8.82,2.3961,0.805,8.5375,1.8303,5.7098,0.8196,5.9055,0.7883,0.4703,0.1447,3.5117,5.8355,2.6519,4.6412,7.0806,1.0417,6.0041,1.9986,3.8158,1.3195,5.1638,0.8958,1.8637,3.1294,6.1482,2.1441,4.3413,0.6026,1.4269,0.0067,10.2145,1.1103,3.3389,3.8534,1.251,3.3257,1.6708,3.2653,6.6493,2.6768,1.7686,0.1102,0.0733,6.258,2.4924,0.7853,2.3887,4.962,1.2208,1.5094,2.5249,7.0504,0.5091,3.4118,8.1096,5.6656,0.7578,0.1738,6.3741,6.0288,6.3831,1.0103,3.2859,3.182,3.5354,0.4371,6.0541,3.7311,1.3676,5.4731,2.2331,3.4258,0.0442,0.0023,0.3283,1.1614,3.0169,1.2886,1.6828,1.9335,2.5973,10.2325,1.1211,9.0431,0.7873,0.3637,1.7576,4.609,3.2812,7.5599,2.4471,4.0573,4.0073,2.6759,0.4974,3.5933,4.4944,6.0038,2.8434,0.648,5.2753,0.5459,0.4893,4.6931,3.9092,2.7623,6.4372,6.0927,1.5146,0.752,1.3841,0.0274,1.0909,3.6417,2.9056,0.094,3.468,3.8458,1.9274,2.5964,2.4384,0.0297,2.9899,4.054,6.2537,0.0035,6.7038,3.6793,0.6571,2.6058,5.1656,3.7652,7.0266,3.0933,1.1319,1.063,1.7657,4.2711,7.2013,0.9968,6.4911,1.562,7.242,5.6362,0.2891,0.1916,1.4625,4.8437,3.0341,1.1444,9.5488,5.0753,7.2602,2.6446,4.8748,3.1112,1.6722,6.6628,0.2427,2.6493,1.5306,0.0652,1.2641,3.4375,1.5799,1.2525,3.5127,0.6041,4.6964,7.5755,1.2944,5.8997,1.0809,0.0744,2.0884]}
{"prompt":"California filed a lawsuit on Wednesday over the Trump administration \u2019 s plan to construct a wall along the border with Mexico , adding to the obstacles facing one of the Republican president \u2019 s","text":"California filed a lawsuit on Wednesday over the Trump administration \u2019 s plan to construct a wall along the border with Mexico, adding to the obstacles facing one of the Republican president \u2019 s signature legislative accomplishments. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in California, alleges that the administration plans to build the wall by purchasing and decommissioning unused military bases for the construction. The lawsuit claims that the president \u2019 s plan is a violation of the U.S. Constitution and that the government need not have to pay for such infrastructure. In an earlier filing, the DOJ stated that it had to oppose the administration \u2019 s proposal to dole out contracts to \u201c private builders \u201d to build the wall along the U.S. \u2013Mexico border, citing that it will increase security at the wall, but may increase costs for the government. Read more\u2026.\nThe Obama administration on Thursday announced a major reorganization of U.S. immigration enforcement and border control, giving California\u2019s congressional delegation a better picture of its plans in those and other vital areas.\n\u201cOur team at Homeland Security has been working with Congressional partners in the California delegation on a plan to take control of the nation\u2019s greatest public safety challenge,\u201d Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a prepared statement.\nJohnson said it is \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that California would be able to fully control its own U.S.- Mexico border over the next 10 years, and that the agency\u2019s plan, which was approved Thursday by U.S. Border Patrol Commissioner John Morton, would help address that problem.\nWhile he said he understands President Barack Obama supports a strategy to improve border security and to enhance border enforcement, Morton said at Wednesday\u2019s hearing that some of the details of U.S. border patrol\u2019s plans were unclear to him.\n\u201cThere are some important implementation details that I would like to make clear,\u201d Morton said. \u201cThere are many factors that must work in tandem.\u201d\nThe administration is planning to reassign the Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection to other non-border enforcement responsibilities, while its plans for border security include a new agency, Border Security Command, and plans to create a more mobile enforcement force.\nJohnson\u2019s announcement left the California delegation in a quandary, since it is also considering shifting some of the Border Patrol\u2019s budget from border enforcement in California to border security in

Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\nWhite House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus\u2019 statement came after a CNN report revealed that the president had given his son a copy of what had been agreed upon and asked him to \u201cdo his job.\u201d\nBut White House spokeswomen Sarah Sanders and Heather Nauert said in a statement on Tuesday evening that Mr. Trump \u201chad absolutely no involvement\u201d in creating the statement, which a New York Times reporter later said was not an official reaction by the administration.\n\u201cWe have never used statements of that nature as part of our official communications with the media,\u201d the statement said.\nThe president\u2019s son also released a Facebook video on Tuesday that went viral, in which he said he had never met with Mr. Kislyak, or any officials named in the New York Times report.\nWhile the White House initially did not address the report, news reports and other media outlets said that Mr. Trump gave Mr. Flynn a copy of the letter and said his son should \u201cdo his job and tell the truth.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s statement also claimed that none of U.S. intelligence agencies had confirmed that Russian officials had interfered in the 2016 presidential election and that none were planning to.\nThe White House statement did not dispute these allegations and did not point to any intelligence agencies.\nIn an interview with NBC\u2019s Today show on Monday, Mr. Trump, who is seen as a populist right-wing politician who often uses inflammatory language, said he thought it was a \u201cgreat job\u201d by Mr. Flynn and that he believed his son would be able to do the job well.\nWhile he has repeatedly questioned and changed his mind about the Russia investigation since he took office, Mr. Trump on Monday described his son\u2019s comments as \u201cvery positive.\u201d\n\u201cThe way they are saying that it was a great job,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way that we think it should be handled.\u201d\nIn a separate statement on Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, Republican Senator James Risch, said the statement by the White House was

After the FDP cancelled a deal with the CDU in December, the coalition fell and the SPD became the country\u2019s new government.\nThere are fears that a shift by the left will prompt Merkel, who rules by a vote of confidence in parliament, to change her cabinet and reshuffle her party.\nThe Christian Democrats, who have come under pressure from angry voters over their handling of the economy, could not muster a majority of seats on their own. The SPD is also likely to suffer badly in the southern North Rhine-Westphalia state, which has traditionally been a safe Conservative stronghold.\nWith her own support under pressure, Merkel told parliament the government should keep on running until elections in September. Her popularity rating of 41 per cent down two points from four months ago showed she may not be as well liked as she once was, with pollsters saying many were looking for \u201ca change of direction\u201d.\n\u201cThe crisis that emerged in the CDU must have an answer; it cannot remain just as it is,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Stark, a professor at the University of Munich.\nThe German economy is struggling with deflation, but it has only hit its lowest level in three years, as the government has cut taxes and expanded public spending.\nThis is in stark contrast to other European economies and, as the European Central Bank keeps interest rates low to stimulate growth, many are concerned over a possible economic crunch.\nThere are fears that the economic crisis affecting Germany may also hit other smaller European countries such as Poland, where a conservative government could suffer a reversal in its recent economic improvements as it tries to balance current-account deficits with rising unemployment.\nEven though Germany\u2019s economy expanded by a solid 6.6 per cent in the last quarter and jobs went up, the European Commission called the economy into \u201cfurther disarray\u201d.","token_len":511,"entropy":[9.1425,2.5497,10.8814,1.4612,6.4173,0.0153,4.1449,5.5615,1.1754,3.6503,9.1033,0.1037,0.6756,1.7712,9.0818,2.0014,0.7864,7.7517,2.7785,1.6377,7.4712,0.3715,3.8579,1.5232,5.0976,2.7486,8.7806,1.0952,7.9237,2.6238,6.5578,0.2365,0.7173,1.7512,3.5531,4.9176,1.9367,7.3349,0.1248,5.9429,0.1525,0.0005,3.6817,0.5864,0.4704,14.7663,4.7794,7.4472,3.924,3.2994,2.7064,1.614,0.7784,6.3649,1.0156,5.3781,1.253,1.039,0.0017,3.6458,1.6169,5.226,0.5288,5.109,15.9533,9.3527,1.8675,5.7054,0.0233,0.4559,4.7373,1.9664,3.3881,5.4664,1.1834,1.6987,0.0381,0.0005,1.0031,5.0108,5.6022,0.2577,5.8165,1.7641,4.353,0.0742,0.4458,6.622,3.5515,1.9554,4.0739,0.1043,1.1012,0.4115,0.0049,0.8294,1.8695,0.9709,5.1604,0.484,1.4497,5.2162,0.7411,4.6418,6.5113,1.9302,4.6234,0.1342,0.756,0.2584,5.2616,1.395,4.7447,1.6303,4.4552,2.0702,4.3913,1.0182,5.546,1.4065,6.2724,2.7447,0.3835,2.8262,4.3257,4.2828,5.4037,1.6305,3.6249,0.0034,7.6837,1.3773,2.8239,0.682,0.8177,1.7481,0.0003,2.0654,2.9858,0.8455,1.4275,5.4149,6.0648,4.5656,1.178,1.5637,4.481,0.5792,5.6746,8.329,0.7458,0.0253,5.0992,4.9182,0.8146,0.4236,5.5552,1.5548,2.77,0.4294,2.7405,5.3607,4.5429,0.9816,3.9154,3.1731,5.5369,2.4733,3.4504,0.8995,8.3522,5.7001,2.3191,4.5731,0.6258,2.5055,1.0686,3.717,0.4866,0.037,4.646,0.5819,7.6838,2.0348,5.3478,0.1855,0.918,1.5247,1.067,0.4825,2.0877,5.2501,0.6989,1.7816,2.3494,1.5832,5.5446,1.1225,2.1513,0.8019,6.4613,1.2528,3.0219,1.4252,2.6532,0.0049,0.6554,4.5629,0.6339,4.2469,3.739,5.0576,1.3573,1.1412,2.1589,2.3583,3.626,4.4685,1.6613,1.5162,2.5372,1.5945,2.0839,2.5774,3.444,0.0119,4.3093,5.8642,1.3997,0.9631,5.9675,5.3868,0.3817,0.0164,0.1556,0.0014,0.0004,0.0096,3.7164,1.2028,1.5877,1.7157,4.4824,0.7015,1.7968,3.1949,6.3204,0.4583,0.5303,0.2446,4.3352,5.6683,4.7967,4.6187,6.2888,2.2558,0.6223,0.3737,5.9172,3.5829,4.0789,2.4937,2.564,4.5693,3.0523,3.9455,3.6992,3.1371,2.6671,2.0091,0.7294,3.7664,5.904,3.1924,5.0286,3.876,1.3918,0.0003,7.3034,6.6835,0.515,1.3799,7.042,1.0026,0.1086,5.9894,3.1648,5.187,1.9593,0.9952,3.5903,4.7588,2.0068,0.6495,1.0609,0.5589,0.2208,1.6196,3.3573,5.8152,0.6853,1.758,4.8243,4.6024,3.8609,0.6442,13.7776,4.7792,3.3422,3.3778,0.7941,3.5406,2.6022,7.6423,2.1484,0.2508,5.0589,1.5755,4.4383,5.731,4.1953,4.7764,1.6067,1.8302,6.0702,0.0004,8.1679,2.3552,6.5818,6.3812,6.7973,2.6037,4.4245,4.5123,4.3158,3.2683,1.8794,1.6647,2.1095,9.3987,4.8143,0.9216,4.5457,1.9223,0.002,10.0188,0.5665,0.8072,2.8172,0.6978,0.6965,1.1318,0.0039,3.7079,0.8337,0.5774,2.5483,4.0515,3.8988,1.2384,3.7247,2.846,3.6336,1.2906,4.004,2.8544,1.7804,5.2608,5.5295,2.2721,1.388,0.2751,0.9053,2.5526,0.2578,1.43,4.6633,1.7265,2.5661,2.3788,2.5342,2.6981,0.9134,6.2639,3.0161,0.8718,0.5045,1.0301,5.1784,1.8646,4.105,2.2919,0.0022,0.2335,4.5222,1.8415,2.0359,4.6469,3.3736,2.29,2.0481,3.3785,0.5497,0.0007,6.869,3.7487,0.0294,0.9036,2.3886,2.067,1.2092,0.1682,3.8672,2.6433,3.8023,4.5,2.8221,3.0065,4.8054,6.9089,0.9824,0.4139,5.2183,1.2396,2.044,0.2982,1.7071,4.4014,1.2598,7.9278,1.1496,2.8779,4.0734,4.4196,2.6896,6.7248,1.6516,0.9755,2.1104,0.0011,2.1081,0.9257,2.5062,2.9922,5.8394,0.9398,3.5603,5.9408,1.0746,7.1855,1.7261,1.3686,5.595,1.9217,9.9788,4.1084,2.6363,1.8494,0.0159,3.4424,8.1448,3.7996,0.1661,0.2286,1.9935,4.5255,2.4973,0.4045,0.2807,4.9023,2.5182,2.412,7.5362,0.1736,0.0018,1.675,5.758,1.202,3.2273,5.4095,3.3896,0.1401,2.2667,0.3906,0.0006,0.5767,0.7296,3.8141,0.8418,3.5664,6.1533,6.4373,0.4019,1.3915,1.3537,5.5318,1.7334,7.091,1.4159,3.6259,5.1992,14.3675,0.0405,3.0412,1.9278,4.0904,0.0471,4.3144,1.0617,1.1625]}

Each group includes missiles with a range of up to 300 km (200 miles), the U.S.-based news service SITE reported.\nRussian intelligence officials told NBC News that the missiles were part of the country \u2019 s missile defense system and intended to strike targets on land, sea and air, according to SITE.\nThis is the beginning of a long series of activities to implement a new US-Russia arms control treaty, which has yet to be ratified. The treaty was signed by Moscow in October 2015, but did not go into force.\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a February 9 speech that Moscow is ready to continue building its missile defenses in Kaliningrad with a new US-Russia agreement in place.\nSITE reported that President Donald Trump \u2019 s new National Security Advisory Council \u2019 s proposed policy towards Russia called for \u201ccontinued diplomacy to promote cooperation on nonproliferation and transparency\u201d and that its goal was that \u201cWe would want a system in place by the end of the year that would allow for the effective deterrence. And, to that end we have significant dialogue ongoing with them.\u201d\nThe US-Russia arms control treaty, according to US officials, has to be ratified both countries \u2019 Congresses, or the treaty will not be effective.\nThe two countries last signed a treaty on July 9, 1991, after the fall of communism, which called for their bases in Afghanistan to be dismantled. It expired in October.\nLavrov has reiterated that Russia was ready to rework the treaty, which included a provision that allows Russia to maintain an expanded military base in Kaliningrad.\nBut Moscow is unlikely to give up the Kaliningrad base for U.S. bases around Europe, he said.

Puigdemont","text":"Catalonia s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont was on track to regain the leadership of Spain s northeastern region after preliminary results showed a coalition of secessionist parties winning a majority in regional elections. Puigdemont, who was initially detained by Spanish police in Catalonia, then fled to France. The new regional leader faces a legal battle in Spain s courts before he is allowed to seek refuge overseas. Puigdemont s Spain-based group called Catalan separatists the Junts Pel Si alliance was ahead by a few votes in the second round of voting. The separatists called the result a victory for Catalonia.\n. Spain s ruling party won a historic victory when it recovered control over Catalonia s regional parliament after elections. Spain s new president Pedro Sanchez ( centre ) will take over from Mariano Rajoy ( right ) as the country s prime minister in the coming months. Pedro Sanchez, the former prime minister of Spain s largest party, the PSOE, leads the coalition between his party and the regional leftist party Unidas Podemos, a coalition which took power in Spain s Congress in December. The election campaign was very close and saw the leftist alliance win an unexpectedly large number of seats while Spain s political right remained fractured, a political analyst from Spain s national University of Salamanca said. While most national political polls that have been conducted right after the elections suggested a win for the conservative coalition led by Rajoy, the final results from the elections were seen as an unexpected turnaround victory for the PSOE, which entered the new parliament after Rajoy s sacking by the European Parliament on May 26. The elections marked a major turnaround for Spain s right and left in which the PSOE managed to get away from the historic status of the second most popular party in Spain s elections since the restoration of democracy in 1978 and now enjoys a record third-place victory, behind the Socialists and a smaller left centrist party, Unidos Podemos.\n. The elections were also a turning point for the president of Spanish region of Catalonia. Carles Puigdemont s Spain-based group called Catalan separatists had called the election a referendum on independence and initially won the seat it held in Parliament. However, the voting results showed that the separatists were barely ahead by a few seats. Puigdemont fled to France immediately after his arrest on October 2. This weekend, his Spain-based group lost their majority in the Catalan Parliament. The elections will be repeated next year until the separatist movement in Catalonia achieves its goal of independence from Spain.","token_len":511,"entropy":[8.9778,8.9347,12.7296,3.8889,6.4433,1.4383,0.1797,0.0192,0.0012,0.0019,3.811,4.7358,7.3605,0.1715,6.1239,2.0418,4.8734,0.6726,4.5324,8.9355,6.8816,0.6579,2.0554,11.0954,1.292,1.3324,2.5939,6.5571,0.7399,4.7199,0.5241,0.7991,4.1903,1.9573,1.0049,1.5181,3.9602,0.4535,1.4938,3.0423,0.0001,0.0013,0.0006,1.5988,1.0663,1.9641,6.0612,5.5868,1.5453,2.2541,1.499,1.9928,4.4561,1.175,4.8366,2.4811,0.4712,2.9221,2.1272,2.9156,4.2529,4.563,3.6884,6.8306,1.2082,5.5655,2.2663,1.826,2.7977,1.2994,2.2662,5.5187,1.4277,1.7905,1.0682,0.3208,4.0418,4.6249,7.0395,0.2812,2.1767,0.0003,0.0015,0.0008,7.9528,7.3384,4.5958,0.856,4.2412,4.124,6.2536,3.542,3.019,7.6315,1.8317,10.4058,11.9535,8.1819,4.3778,6.8217,4.3963,2.0261,3.4643,2.8437,0.9485,1.2284,4.7733,0.4948,0.246,1.706,1.5962,1.9526,4.0046,5.2656,2.1663,3.5981,1.1317,2.5342,0.4718,3.3308,2.0218,2.3902,10.5512,5.438,1.0266,4.4387,2.0864,5.9282,1.8292,6.2232,2.3014,4.0401,1.0859,8.3925,1.9842,2.1653,2.525,1.5102,1.9744,1.2077,2.2769,4.8128,2.3571,3.5212,0.5341,3.8212,3.2413,4.8689,6.3139,4.4984,9.5623,0.9496,4.1248,2.2107,0.6882,1.4623,6.0009,0.007,0.0001,0.0002,0.7277,1.5037,0.3329,2.2309,1.957,1.6773,1.2783,5.4717,0.0084,2.7125,2.1745,1.7822,1.4089,0.7033,6.6616,0.4538,2.7097,1.7711,2.1449,2.6542,0.0131,1.0401,0.6492,1.1044,5.1456,2.396,0.5315,2.8533,6.2877,0.0872,0.6525,5.9781,1.0676,3.7443,5.6108,2.5566,1.9455,0.6345,0.8261,4.5614,5.8453,2.5009,6.788,5.3185,7.0153,0.0421,0.0034,2.4285,3.1005,2.7078,3.4577,5.1321,1.9337,0.409,5.3898,0.4407,7.6225,1.4984,3.4509,1.2402,2.2672,4.4461,5.0224,2.1162,6.442,1.7708,2.6045,6.0265,1.4632,5.9403,4.3813,1.1275,3.7295,5.319,1.755,2.173,0.0082,0.5681,5.2912,4.0785,0.2025,4.6326,4.9537,5.8074,5.7211,3.0639,4.7166,4.4252,2.8734,3.9957,3.3508,0.5287,4.3915,5.2306,0.6469,6.2814,1.5107,0.7903,0.5975,5.4934,4.6618,6.1878,3.5822,5.8014,6.5487,1.7477,1.1947,0.4635,9.527,2.2766,0.4549,1.9733,4.815,1.9719,4.4152,0.3272,0.7478,3.9223,3.4741,4.6354,0.0094,3.4047,0.0013,0.7978,1.4176,6.2523,0.9029,4.5143,0.8737,3.5962,2.9027,5.115,0.2577,3.248,4.7029,6.4414,9.0135,0.4465,0.6265,4.1595,0.0069,1.9256,0.8436,5.9225,1.0616,5.0493,1.1273,2.9277,2.6913,0.001,3.3756,6.5751,10.6917,4.4258,3.3895,4.4738,1.5225,3.0821,3.0347,3.8591,0.4066,1.6592,4.4472,4.4217,1.081,2.4335,3.9992,0.247,2.3384,0.1236,3.3923,2.7191,0.3993,1.771,4.1695,1.0198,2.3075,0.0039,4.9682,0.1145,4.3469,5.9797,2.9779,0.8823,7.7391,5.6543,2.2186,1.0111,5.6502,3.476,1.6873,0.9633,0.7871,1.1128,0.4329,3.5629,5.711,1.7648,8.7088,0.0275,3.5623,0.5379,4.4661,3.6369,5.4268,3.2561,0.8456,5.3668,4.7203,1.6793,1.5718,6.7069,3.6367,6.2915,1.204,2.9353,0.0964,1.2629,4.4178,4.7923,4.1455,9.1525,1.6135,1.4412,4.538,3.2719,0.0538,1.1142,0.0025,0.0024,0.4984,1.7098,1.5846,1.6016,4.3177,1.7619,2.9823,1.7033,3.6624,0.0035,0.544,0.8436,7.0446,0.8874,5.2776,6.8731,2.7425,0.3909,2.9796,5.8984,0.0082,0.0146,0.0001,0.0012,0.0002,3.1291,3.631,1.1538,0.0532,0.9955,0.1337,0.5357,0.0223,6.3617,6.8099,2.1325,2.2688,1.2291,5.984,0.4774,1.1646,1.8552,8.8399,1.0404,2.499,3.6053,4.7702,0.8311,1.1258,7.4923,0.9384,2.4133,0.1605,1.4562,8.0114,1.7526,1.3732,1.0755,0.997,3.1251,2.6498,8.0067,1.7371,2.0896,1.546,0.8837,2.7927,1.6472,2.702,0.0003,0.0008,0.0006,7.133,0.3493,0.1112,7.1166,0.3035,2.7069,0.5616,3.1388,4.5414,3.4469,1.1246,5.3627,7.4902,0.8894,3.5795,6.505,2.0324,0.021,0.458,6.893,4.7301,3.8113,0.7281,0.7966,2.0032,2.7937,1.7264,1.821,4.8219,3.8032,1.257,7.8563,2.5079,1.1302,6.3698,1.6056,5.5853,3.1501,3.732,0.5192,6.0691,1.939,1.3926,0.035,3.1998,1.3485,0.0662,1.3979]}
{"prompt":"Krassi Nikov evacuated his Houston home with more than 2 feet ( 61 cm ) of water inside of it on Tuesday after Tropical Storm Harvey devastated Texas \u2019 Gulf Coast . He now plans","text":"Krassi Nikov evacuated his Houston home with more than 2 feet ( 61 cm ) of water inside of it on Tuesday after Tropical Storm Harvey devastated Texas \u2019 Gulf Coast. He now plans to move to the northern city of Odessa, which has been spared significant flooding.\nIn the evening, the Houston Chronicle reported that the storm surge is just over 13 ft. The water reached 13 meters at Point Arthur ( 6.5 meters ) and 12.5 meters at Brazoria\u2019s port, where it will be difficult to save ships that are caught in the flood.\nThis is my version of a traditional cake, this version uses yogurt. I tried it when I was going on a gluten free diet and it was a success so I thought I'd put it on here too. I added the pecans to the topping as well and it was a great combination.\nPreheat the oven to 180 C (Gas Mark 4). Line the base and sides of an 18- x 12-inch (35- x 25-cm) glass square cake tin or lightly greased cake pan with baking parchment. Spread the bottom half of the greased parchment with the butter and place into the cake tin. Using a metal spoon, gently push the butter into the tin. If any of the lumps of butter stick, melt the butter between two towel and then gently push it underneath and along the sides of the tin.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together all the ingredients for the batter until smooth and creamy. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Allow to cool in the tin completely before turning out and setting on a wire rack. Once the cake is completely cooled, cover the top, sides and the bottom with foil and leave to dry in the tin for about 10 minutes. If the cake is baked longer, the top will become to dry and crumbly.\nIn a medium bowl, combine the condensed milk, sugar, cornflour, and yogurt. Whisk until smooth and set aside.\nWhen the cake is completely cooled, carefully remove it from the foil. With a knife, divide the cake into three pieces and cut each piece in half and then into thirds. Turn each section horizontally and gently lift out the tin from one quarter of the dish. Spread the buttercream mixture over the top of the cake. Add the pecans on top and cover the entire top of the cake with the remaining buttercream.","token_len":512,"entropy":[6.6449,10.2641,10.502,5.6797,14.0051,2.3445,10.5308,1.7018,3.6909,5.7083,0.0643,4.0659,6.9155,3.721,18.7398,1.6083,0.1475,0.1662,1.4294,4.7279,5.0632,1.2677,3.9988,2.5942,2.8971,8.2471,0.0475,1.3734,4.6143,4.915,14.1743,6.4613,8.4255,0.2674,1.1249,2.9846,5.8302,3.0735,0.0417,2.7491,1.0875,2.1765,5.1881,4.8312,0.1299,8.2702,0.002,1.2627,3.4013,1.9538,1.0423,4.0027,5.1526,0.8829,1.2098,0.8428,13.6637,1.9089,6.1855,0.3923,2.1464,3.9294,1.1424,0.2985,0.4706,2.081,3.0362,4.7351,3.5485,5.3322,2.298,5.4207,5.8925,2.2437,2.8815,5.2302,5.466,5.1086,4.1229,3.5093,7.22,6.0677,5.5242,8.2145,1.7032,1.7071,2.2545,1.3485,3.3747,4.3116,1.7573,0.6191,0.0821,0.1182,5.296,2.8123,10.373,0.4613,7.2142,6.7887,2.3133,2.6883,1.5011,5.1623,2.5142,5.4505,0.2277,5.7372,9.0329,3.4299,1.325,6.1335,0.5851,0.3959,2.7731,3.2001,0.5748,4.9979,1.3507,7.6947,5.7174,0.178,3.1187,7.9204,7.9266,2.6097,5.4559,4.5814,5.8752,8.3652,2.2829,2.6239,5.0812,2.2616,5.4942,0.5864,0.3087,5.5824,3.4664,1.8448,8.9992,0.3749,1.2429,1.691,1.0063,1.3997,3.2915,3.5531,4.6989,1.7041,3.9166,1.2006,0.8609,4.4532,0.6872,1.1119,3.0668,3.3555,0.2762,2.3097,4.6579,3.1633,6.9347,2.0908,0.004,2.0816,1.172,5.6075,3.2946,1.136,2.1727,2.016,1.4407,2.4866,2.4235,5.0134,0.7572,1.573,7.4545,1.9823,1.0945,0.0368,0.0524,3.4935,3.8688,1.7235,7.6736,3.4486,2.7279,1.7858,2.7763,3.1797,6.4926,3.9952,2.0167,0.1877,2.5524,3.8806,2.7106,8.0691,3.5307,0.1691,0.328,1.2537,4.8058,3.6475,3.6179,2.8797,0.9119,0.5041,0.1325,5.5187,8.8581,0.8446,1.8644,4.5243,7.649,2.0374,0.0038,4.1514,0.4925,0.411,2.9165,1.7099,0.5741,4.3387,0.9324,4.9131,3.7136,0.0883,0.1014,8.3313,0.0101,5.3696,3.1072,1.1491,5.1518,1.4049,3.8177,3.9268,0.4521,4.6158,0.2054,0.8574,4.4717,0.5381,5.5624,1.4431,0.3995,2.8387,3.9142,0.6699,2.5782,1.9848,0.0969,6.0865,1.5308,4.5642,6.269,1.5142,0.0862,6.5497,0.0896,3.7161,0.6892,3.0869,2.5583,6.1054,0.733,0.979,7.1634,1.5149,9.611,6.0998,3.1368,2.7119,2.6932,1.593,7.5249,3.1546,6.7757,0.3112,1.5208,0.6544,0.0343,1.5583,0.6616,2.5524,3.5268,0.5622,1.2252,0.6708,0.2607,1.1001,0.167,3.4697,0.5778,1.6368,1.8074,0.4368,3.9439,3.0499,1.869,1.6934,0.9908,0.3,2.6977,0.8345,0.3923,0.6478,0.7716,1.244,1.4101,0.5548,1.8019,0.5026,2.0727,1.0498,1.2019,0.0523,0.8863,0.0075,1.666,5.1796,0.0018,0.0477,0.7878,0.0858,3.7606,0.6336,0.06,0.0372,0.3868,3.3693,0.4334,0.033,3.3701,0.1945,1.266,6.8097,1.1313,5.3401,1.9045,4.8891,6.0693,2.1111,0.2865,0.2089,0.0026,0.8528,4.2383,2.367,1.345,0.7987,3.2105,0.9612,0.2687,5.2401,1.2419,3.124,4.7764,1.9605,0.4154,3.9227,1.53,0.7238,1.7119,0.5616,2.8226,0.6546,5.7246,2.1234,0.2473,1.9078,0.5262,2.368,2.0714,0.2698,0.6863,3.8507,1.3713,0.9571,0.7196,6.2513,4.4257,0.7308,1.8746,2.6888,0.6022,2.6412,8.1339,6.5927,1.1013,6.0285,0.2775,0.1078,0.6776,1.3361,3.9334,0.5131,2.2037,0.5494,0.1046,1.6548,0.3387,6.225,0.1379,0.5331,2.2792,0.5626,4.4917,4.5698,0.3001,0.5648,3.0738,6.0501,0.7723,3.2942,0.0015,1.5336,1.0904,1.0293,7.0748,0.4505,0.1156,0.922,4.3374,0.4205,0.5494,0.2351,3.2122,0.5516,0.192,3.7309,2.5903,2.9132,0.0586,0.0365,3.3632,3.0508,5.2645,0.3729,4.5397,0.3692,6.8575,0.2847,1.4535,0.4144,3.1967,2.777,1.0784,2.8721,2.2895,0.7326,1.7969,0.0637,3.564,2.4108,5.1463,3.3586,0.3476,5.728,1.7347,6.7441,6.6157,1.1114,6.4434,3.873,3.6776,0.6162,7.162,2.2667,5.0367,6.5092,1.4827,0.1324,8.0002,1.2641,4.4339,0.5128,4.7629,4.1666,2.3693,1.553,0.391,1.5519,0.8967,1.4357,0.5924,1.9703,4.7178,0.454,3.1424,0.0933,0.0056,5.4474,0.1183,1.0395,4.5688,1.4709,5.155,1.6396,1.4794,0.0937,0.1242,0.5712,1.7414,2.2186,0.4735,0.2884,1.091]}

Conyers has always denied that he ever engaged in anything improper with that woman,\u201d Conyers told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t see any explanation for his continued denial.\u201d\nThe Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives on Monday approved a resolution on Wednesday calling on Rep. Conyers to resign if he is convicted, calling him a \u201cconspicuous violator\u201d of its rules.\nOn Monday, the House Intelligence Committee said that Rep. Conyers has \u201cincredible\u201d claims of sexual harassment in an internal e-mail discussion, and that Rep. Conyers never offered to resign. The committee said that the e-mails \u201cwere used as a tactic to cover up the real issue of an inappropriate political campaign fundraising activity.\u201d\nAfter the meeting, Rep. Conyers\u2019 office said that the congressman would \u201crefuse to resign\u201d and demanded that he return public funds used for his office.\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Conyers filed a petition with the U.S. Senate to stop his impeachment process, and stated that he would not be returning public money that he contributed to his campaign, instead stating that he would not resign.\nSchools across the country are getting ready to reopen for in-person learning this fall after a year-long closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some students and teachers have been reporting that the new coronavirus could be present on the desks students use.\nTeachers in Texas, for example, tested for the coronavirus on the desks of their fifth-grade students and found it was still present in many of them, while the surfaces they used for class were cleaner, according to NBC.\nBut the problem isn\u2019t isolated to the United States.

ambitions, were holding talks about how to impose even more sanctions on the North while at the same time hoping to stop further military provocations by the regime.\nIn a move that could be designed to prevent any further military provocation, the North's propaganda agency reported that a group of the \"Three Powers\" foreign experts, including United Nations sanctions experts, were going to be visiting its eastern border with China at the weekend.\nThe trip would probably be aimed at finding ways to implement the international sanctions more comprehensively that would target North Korea's trade, its key economic sources of income, making Pyongyang even weaker.\nEarlier this week, the North's main ally Pakistan told Washington that it is not willing to give any military support to the United States in any military action against the North.\nThe New York Times reported that Pakistan could not agree with the United States proposal to provide safe passage along the Afghan border to armouried convoys and military personnel that would help the Americans push their military ground forces beyond the Pakistani border.\nThe United States is hoping that the deployment of additional troops to the western border will prevent a repeat of the September 2001 attacks on the US Embassy in Kabul, which led to the regime change and the ouster of the government of then Afghan president Mohammad Yasaman Azar.\nHowever, in the meantime, the Iranian regime is planning further military provocations that may involve ballistic missiles as well as warships.","token_len":512,"entropy":[9.0361,0.7028,5.7936,0.734,2.005,1.9546,5.7552,0.1427,1.0141,3.0569,2.697,5.736,0.0753,3.1793,0.8472,2.8637,0.4464,0.0009,3.6601,0.6887,0.9223,3.1221,8.0419,0.7134,0.0435,4.8781,0.0144,3.1374,5.6201,3.2239,1.6816,8.7205,5.9892,2.1847,0.0223,3.296,0.658,0.8407,5.4749,4.1503,0.1966,2.3946,0.435,0.2344,11.4041,4.8428,5.6916,3.5638,1.3153,4.3067,0.658,1.9653,4.7497,2.3377,6.2946,4.8551,1.3745,7.9716,1.1297,0.3342,4.0271,2.8012,1.3972,7.4252,3.697,5.0339,0.3946,2.7205,3.1466,4.6318,0.7485,3.551,3.3196,1.6047,0.0128,4.0461,0.0148,2.1458,4.2281,5.2383,3.7632,3.5617,4.0428,2.8269,0.5302,0.5118,2.3228,1.3287,1.08,2.159,1.3729,0.0499,2.0731,4.5499,2.421,1.2006,0.467,0.0694,0.0334,0.486,0.1376,1.261,5.6036,2.2167,2.5768,1.0464,1.5158,6.621,0.3942,3.474,6.4818,6.11,3.3604,1.8852,5.0113,1.5997,3.7812,3.2479,0.2287,0.2453,4.4367,0.032,3.9251,6.7573,2.3231,0.0196,0.6106,0.3148,5.8796,3.756,4.0388,3.1464,3.2974,2.6194,3.1098,6.3575,2.2845,3.1354,5.7321,0.58,0.9382,0.0411,1.9143,2.2669,3.4977,1.2963,0.0018,0.0726,0.7015,0.0043,3.0007,1.5186,3.0123,0.0023,4.7447,2.104,0.0209,0.481,0.3218,0.1391,1.476,1.6285,3.5121,5.1265,0.0071,1.3286,4.1191,0.0015,4.5265,0.7744,7.092,6.1463,1.7717,6.8685,3.3684,1.8208,1.5828,4.5872,3.3658,4.4804,4.9975,0.451,0.9461,7.1523,0.6344,6.5377,1.1159,0.0019,1.4106,4.3406,3.4155,3.169,8.5797,4.1457,0.501,1.2835,0.5614,4.5527,1.5409,1.7493,1.722,0.1104,2.8204,2.2981,0.3806,3.428,6.3835,2.5954,2.3477,0.1896,5.1676,6.7539,5.8389,3.1497,2.5481,5.3812,0.9304,4.7397,0.035,3.1603,2.2798,5.4725,0.7202,1.0246,1.3041,1.7365,0.1904,2.4038,5.2395,1.7966,3.239,3.2991,0.1532,7.3403,7.5941,0.7435,0.9511,0.6075,0.9229,1.2124,5.2514,4.6588,0.0198,0.0028,0.0014,5.8853,0.7021,5.1437,5.37,3.7063,3.1488,0.0001,2.3691,0.8411,2.6006,0.3191,0.1779,3.4357,1.515,4.5012,1.022,1.8908,2.5293,7.6503,0.0425,3.9306,2.6177,1.1024,1.9953,2.9076,0.8598,0.8506,1.9092,2.3773,5.1468,1.0979,5.1344,1.0234,2.8508,3.8911,0.1717,5.6119,3.3739,1.6304,0.0315,0.1873,8.3565,4.8652,2.8605,1.151,6.2242,0.7201,6.3204,1.7721,0.6537,2.1126,5.4528,0.1474,3.011,3.7905,6.3114,5.9216,1.2,2.6191,1.7829,3.76,0.399,3.7265,1.0009,0.5004,1.2645,5.2443,2.1096,5.3493,1.1878,2.4836,0.0556,6.3652,1.7174,0.2098,5.3903,1.3039,5.4999,0.9017,7.1689,7.4874,0.0035,4.7262,2.2117,4.8942,1.5056,0.3001,1.001,6.6164,1.6612,4.4522,7.4408,1.7528,4.7209,2.8879,0.7902,1.6043,8.3666,5.6143,5.027,6.1061,2.3451,0.4635,5.993,0.6307,1.2123,0.7944,1.1531,1.4313,1.5298,4.8363,3.2454,9.11,4.7307,3.1437,0.6304,0.5406,3.5055,3.3443,2.2976,0.0209,3.4214,4.2945,2.7929,2.2194,0.1374,0.7469,3.2957,0.0235,1.4563,2.5198,3.9955,1.3737,1.3796,0.5602,1.6265,1.1373,0.7384,1.5888,6.4041,0.0188,0.0617,0.5962,0.8833,1.6899,5.0815,1.9604,3.3342,3.625,0.6257,2.047,0.1506,7.8354,0.9622,4.2048,6.6036,2.0678,6.4783,0.7771,4.9172,0.2021,1.8319,8.1812,16.7299,11.4872,6.6409,0.0016,3.8638,4.36,1.7786,2.9659,1.7719,4.0453,1.7902,5.0229,5.0865,3.2775,3.7481,8.4347,1.2219,5.5738,0.6224,4.1594,0.7062,0.6057,0.4551,1.3971,2.1318,0.2389,2.4633,5.0382,1.151,1.2971,5.3116,0.1725,4.8767,1.3945,1.0137,1.014,5.7238,1.2654,1.5872,4.4301,2.5593,1.8754,0.0223,0.4871,4.974,4.7493,1.0618,1.0381,0.5307,2.2588,2.6499,0.3387,2.0796,1.9074,1.1591,4.2298,0.0504,0.5725,9.7211,4.1613,3.121,1.5285,6.276,0.5098,0.0177,1.1642,3.8227,1.2953,2.398,4.3175,2.2124,3.3659,11.9167,17.2252,6.3404,5.3716,0.906,0.5622,3.3672,0.5611,4.0055,1.8353,3.1173,0.5672,0.8407,6.5912,2.6261,1.9961,4.1922,4.7455,1.6333,3.4675,0.0005,2.8203,3.6257,3.3201,5.5199,0.3384,3.8607,0.139,0.1374,8.1882,1.6096]}

To do that, negotiators from the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are to meet starting Tuesday. The meeting was called to assess the progress after three weeks of negotiations on a package that will provide $750 billion in aid to Americans struggling with the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Negotiators from both houses of Congress took the wraps off their proposed plan in the last few weeks. At a briefing last week, they announced an initial $650 billion relief package that included $300 billion in direct payments to Americans. The proposal did not include jobless benefits or small business loans, as Republicans have demanded. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has previously said the government can\u2019t extend the coronavirus payroll tax holiday, which expiring on July 15, as part of a package he\u2019ll propose to Congress.\nAs the economy reels from the coronavirus outbreak, many companies are pulling their investors, including Microsoft Corp. This comes on the heels of reports indicating that Tesla Inc. and Amazon, Inc. have sold off stock for over $25 billion to repurchase it. However, executives at Alphabet Inc. said Monday that the firm did not sell stocks this month. \u201cFrom a portfolio perspective we\u2019re not interested in selling any stock in any current situation,\u201d said Larry Page. \u201cWe have zero stock and absolutely no intention of ever selling any stock.\u201d The coronavirus is causing retail companies to pull their cash and assets, and a recent report by the Wall Street Institute found the pandemic has sent retail stocks down as much as 35% from record highs. At the same time, the virus is helping to propel shares of e-commerce players, like Amazon and Tesla.\nThe number of coronavirus cases in Minnesota is projected to soar past 15,000 on Monday after a record-breaking week of daily increases, according to data released late Thursday by the state health department. On Thursday, the Minnesota Department of Health reported nearly 3,700 cases and more than 35 deaths were attributed to the virus. The health department now projects that the next few days will bring more than 4,000 cases and between 50 and 70 deaths.

About 90 percent of the Americans and U.S. troops there are Americans.\nMr. Trump is reviewing the war effort as he focuses on his electoral chances in the Democratic-led Senate, in which Democrats have made efforts to block new military deployments.\nPresident Barack Obama announced in October that he would ask Congress for an additional 2.2 million troops by 2016 \u2013 nearly triple the number that the war effort employed at the time of a review in 2010 \u2013 as well as a review of the security situation in Afghanistan, including the possibility of U.S. withdrawal if the Afghan National Army was not capable of taking on ISIL.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. deployed about 50,000 additional troops into Afghanistan and Iraq to try to end their wars, which began in Afghanistan about 10 years ago when American forces killed Osama bin Laden and his alleged commanders.\nAsked whether he was confident that the U.S. could end its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, President Trump said: \u201cDefinitely. I\u2019m confident, I have no doubt.\u201d\nPrevious PostU.S. will stay in Mexico for as long as it takesNext PostU.S. troops sent to Kuwait to train locals","token_len":513,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,3.4669,1.8901,2.4031,2.1383,2.0621,5.9572,5.2686,0.2817,4.2758,0.8562,0.7636,0.5065,2.082,3.9009,0.0006,0.0187,0.1103,2.1943,7.3782,1.4353,1.0698,1.3501,3.1569,2.0915,6.5215,0.9363,2.6817,2.6749,2.9144,3.9836,3.6692,1.9747,0.139,2.2224,4.0227,11.3575,1.0356,7.9918,2.6975,2.8947,2.7303,0.4031,0.5783,5.1347,2.2019,3.8064,5.4167,1.105,1.9113,5.2939,0.0385,2.573,0.0003,0.0008,0.0124,1.0905,4.5734,5.2454,0.9815,4.2842,0.0473,1.6304,0.1154,0.218,21.4498,1.9359,0.7825,1.5479,4.4356,0.1557,0.9034,4.6016,1.8937,5.4514,0.4634,4.4563,7.1071,4.4604,3.2989,2.384,5.5882,2.7894,0.5313,2.1275,0.0499,0.0723,0.5661,1.2721,13.5191,8.7312,4.3379,12.3884,14.2748,2.6027,3.0139,0.2691,3.5049,0.7407,6.3175,1.514,2.1309,3.2283,2.7253,0.0053,0.1261,0.5297,4.2639,7.6537,2.3564,2.7303,4.8539,0.5506,0.2877,6.3127,8.5634,2.5246,0.727,2.1253,1.8982,0.9934,3.5865,0.1328,0.2788,2.834,1.3809,0.559,1.2586,0.7531,0.9647,6.5206,9.143,0.5783,7.5746,6.3238,0.0386,0.2313,2.6941,2.3721,5.6841,1.3504,1.0111,4.828,1.5061,1.1452,2.6899,3.3614,0.0021,2.6859,1.1392,2.1684,5.1086,2.9562,4.555,3.4876,0.864,5.2048,0.0004,0.0081,0.0648,5.178,8.2908,1.9959,0.9781,4.5709,0.8707,5.6445,0.465,4.4948,0.1248,3.3822,2.6124,4.4029,0.3391,1.1831,2.8213,3.8761,0.3243,2.6364,5.8415,2.1885,1.0139,1.7512,3.2068,1.3455,0.4296,5.7092,0.585,2.0045,3.9489,0.0003,0.0511,2.6282,2.3479,1.3545,0.3476,6.1323,0.6462,3.6282,3.0827,0.7491,3.5885,4.6986,0.8649,0.5936,3.6907,0.2566,0.1188,1.8853,0.0003,0.7687,3.0116,0.5323,0.5406,3.5609,7.1676,2.427,2.5708,1.6487,0.4498,6.1677,5.2748,0.0966,1.3205,0.0004,0.1388,5.2369,2.2343,5.8589,0.1577,4.4647,6.2818,5.2859,0.1141,0.0025,0.64,0.355,0.2987,2.2687,2.9798,4.8515,0.4096,0.0007,5.1689,0.8423,0.5366,2.3764,5.423,5.7167,2.5544,1.3692,3.6576,4.2308,3.1453,0.0005,0.0013,0.079,7.5527,5.2924,8.5758,0.4223,0.0014,0.8585,0.9937,6.7637,4.0399,0.5631,0.0446,0.8049,6.2468,4.9597,4.2214,0.0009,0.0035,0.0302,1.9753,2.0419,0.9686,7.312,0.9205,0.5018,2.2255,0.0005,0.0672,3.8809,7.3584,1.0635,5.6646,2.1425,3.7331,1.6781,6.594,0.1594,2.3826,7.2632,3.3681,1.1879,2.0132,6.5497,1.6645,1.8209,1.5693,1.4935,4.758,1.5672,2.1612,1.3076,4.6186,4.59,0.0604,3.498,5.9293,1.4772,3.715,0.9323,0.6523,5.4575,0.7977,0.0028,3.115,0.9929,3.5234,0.6739,0.5953,0.6905,5.8621,0.1892,1.2233,3.1302,0.7582,4.025,1.2371,1.0404,0.1325,0.6242,2.7151,3.6108,6.2492,4.3007,4.2156,0.4082,1.3352,3.0525,2.5225,6.062,0.6608,8.6728,4.0575,0.2232,1.7828,2.9794,5.8525,6.0523,1.7567,2.889,4.3195,2.9701,3.6383,0.0083,2.1348,5.2994,0.356,1.1085,5.2293,0.7556,0.5909,0.438,2.123,3.7314,1.6497,2.3723,0.3156,3.6774,0.0003,0.0008,0.0631,3.667,3.6813,1.1249,2.8941,4.3048,0.2469,4.1283,2.068,5.8487,0.0446,3.7206,1.9639,5.8808,0.727,0.4902,6.0691,0.1799,1.0454,0.0606,1.5705,2.3971,0.0005,0.0126,0.0164,4.6604,2.8711,3.7544,0.4091,0.0023,3.2471,0.6111,4.2295,0.3584,3.2181,1.9564,1.9793,4.774,0.1352,4.2853,5.9525,5.2692,1.8143,3.1681,2.8759,0.5706,7.083,5.4969,3.501,0.1069,0.0209,5.4094,3.8568,0.9482,5.9065,2.921,0.1203,0.0016,1.3614,1.5019,6.0765,5.5321,0.5626,0.7784,5.8609,1.7938,0.873,2.0768,4.8587,1.047,0.952,1.2211,0.0005,0.0013,0.0177,2.2198,3.298,1.2294,2.8552,1.0471,0.5382,0.8167,0.0279,0.8585,5.4033,0.5809,0.3814,0.3944,0.1171,0.6788,6.9448,0.0175,0.3563,2.0841,4.1101,0.3478,0.835,1.9792,2.9817,1.9644,3.0908,3.7962,0.8519,1.1046,3.9393,0.5501,0.343,8.3591,4.8688,9.6104,0.0066,0.0015,0.0561,5.7445,4.9737,0.9951,10.265,2.2746,4.7997,0.0392,0.0112,2.6305,0.6552,14.7112,0.0143,2.4144,0.001,0.0017,0.0222,4.1075,6.1085,0.4243,7.3133,1.9526,3.7464,8.3926]}

The two will meet during a ministerial visit by al-Hariri to the European home of American diplomacy, which comes before an estimated mid-March visit by Trump\u2019s presidential campaign manager, Paul Manafort. The Washington Post reported Thursday that the visit by al-Hariri also will include a discussion of the ongoing Syrian civil war. But the Lebanese prime minister was already scheduled to discuss the Syria civil war with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Thursday in Damascus.\nA year after the last deadly shooting at a synagogue in an American city this season, four times more dead white men than Jews were gunned down in a similar shooting this year in Chicago, with three of those deaths taking place in the last five days. An unarmed 34-year-old white man killed three and injured 12 when he opened fire on Passover night at a synagogue on South Side in what police considered a hate crime. At least 27 people were killed in a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh in 2018, which left seven Jewish victims and a Muslim man dead. In Chicago last weekend two men armed with shotguns opened fire at people at a wedding party, fatally wounding two white men and making 10 people, mostly family and friends in the room, wounded: one of those people was a man who was killed by a law enforcement officer.\nThe Obama administration is taking aim at Donald Trump\u2019s administration and its decision to withdraw American personnel from an air base in Syria, a move that threatens to dismantle a critical part of American forces there. \u201cIf this were just another policy choice, it would have less of a significant impact in terms of how we fight terrorism, but in terms of just the effect it has on the U.S. mission and the level of coordination of our international partners in the fight against the Syrian and Iranian armed forces, those are very significant consequences,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, the president\u2019s national security adviser.\nThe United States on Thursday denied reports that President Donald Trump was preparing to close the U.S. embassy in Cairo and sever ties with Egypt, saying the reports were unfounded. The \u201crumors of Trump thinking about closing the U.S. embassy in Cairo and severing ties with Egypt are simply unfounded and I can assure our Egyptian allies that we will remain steadfast in a robust and deepening relationship,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.","token_len":513,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,4.5444,1.9909,11.8142,0.6546,0.001,0.7897,0.0141,5.0203,0.0014,0.0272,0.0009,1.6818,3.3545,1.0185,2.3707,1.5644,2.1248,2.7831,0.005,0.3732,1.6972,0.0699,0.1191,1.8417,2.0971,0.1373,3.0438,2.7836,3.3735,1.6529,4.4648,1.362,7.4514,2.249,2.5319,7.5015,0.0138,0.0876,0.0038,1.2015,1.7734,3.8692,10.6723,1.9846,7.9861,8.6958,2.4644,2.3635,5.0861,4.5221,3.6449,5.251,7.8023,0.0316,2.8988,2.95,0.7005,2.9937,14.8,9.3658,3.2408,5.1525,3.1573,4.608,1.9297,0.7244,0.0002,0.3302,2.1752,6.229,0.1646,0.4908,2.3854,0.1684,1.327,4.0578,3.8636,3.6613,0.0013,0.0038,0.0006,5.7252,2.4199,1.7899,1.4477,4.5428,0.6052,1.7214,4.2003,1.6089,0.8581,0.0136,1.0114,5.9552,1.094,5.1422,1.5333,0.0181,3.6889,5.2108,2.9426,0.0282,5.1796,0.8929,3.6874,3.4424,0.0583,0.985,4.4502,2.276,0.0058,0.793,0.0,5.1739,2.6741,5.191,0.7131,1.0643,11.1753,6.9132,2.2347,1.4421,6.4649,6.7264,4.6251,1.6776,1.1855,6.233,0.1708,6.5319,1.0843,1.5157,8.4139,6.2577,0.2446,6.0808,8.0934,1.2844,4.6258,8.3601,1.2787,2.0491,5.8152,1.1152,3.5209,0.0127,0.9013,2.9536,3.7901,3.3225,3.7902,0.9549,1.1504,3.9824,1.0314,5.8653,4.5398,1.5998,1.0212,2.4857,5.3258,0.0171,0.3532,1.4186,4.3985,3.315,1.6484,0.7893,5.961,4.9949,7.4954,0.0107,0.0014,0.0055,0.0006,2.2817,0.3319,3.7798,2.356,3.956,1.6849,3.8302,3.8481,0.9985,1.855,0.001,0.769,13.2767,0.0448,5.8566,3.1945,0.8868,4.0073,3.753,3.9622,1.6396,4.9879,5.5777,1.9361,6.2675,1.0656,1.6268,0.0929,0.4471,4.9674,0.2656,4.5603,1.1424,0.5182,0.9516,1.1272,2.6478,4.9402,1.599,0.591,7.245,1.1769,7.3941,0.9393,3.7179,3.1721,3.5014,4.5088,2.9148,2.0383,2.9312,4.7423,2.4084,1.0826,0.388,2.7222,3.4389,2.6711,4.2003,5.834,2.8128,5.2208,0.0233,4.5162,2.2885,0.0061,1.3358,6.9427,2.626,0.4089,6.8263,1.7805,2.0979,4.5972,0.2813,1.9902,5.736,1.0996,1.5552,6.9801,5.8268,4.1621,3.5592,4.6013,8.1945,3.0143,0.272,5.5033,0.7145,5.5384,1.5636,7.8509,8.6507,2.585,1.7951,4.1653,4.1476,0.6666,1.5137,3.4668,1.5834,1.4106,4.053,1.3802,1.4518,5.6573,0.0995,0.1103,1.2807,1.3494,2.4344,6.1465,0.0993,2.9235,4.6955,4.5987,0.037,6.1445,0.0268,3.2418,0.1561,0.0069,3.6678,3.099,2.0256,5.2254,0.1774,4.2145,3.6756,5.5667,0.0573,6.0863,2.8638,0.7755,0.2001,2.465,1.5055,2.4093,0.5299,0.5973,5.0997,0.4664,7.6568,2.2684,4.7639,3.5919,0.0016,3.5186,5.9243,1.3256,0.6549,10.19,4.0392,7.6825,3.0223,3.0241,3.8912,2.9141,6.2251,4.8933,0.908,1.8311,0.4292,1.6582,7.309,2.9966,1.1066,5.765,0.3763,3.509,2.437,0.0009,3.1459,1.6755,3.8323,1.5264,1.9305,1.5393,3.865,0.5457,0.0049,6.2742,2.8883,6.2567,1.2242,1.3289,0.3827,1.4662,2.9963,0.0006,0.001,0.2636,5.4193,3.2078,1.5349,5.8257,0.032,6.5483,3.8911,0.8996,4.4661,2.0216,2.7257,1.1079,0.7427,0.1478,3.2438,3.4728,4.7526,1.8735,5.152,2.2413,1.0034,5.2836,1.3991,3.4847,3.0616,5.1093,3.3629,10.1613,7.631,3.7849,5.6446,0.3904,0.0615,2.0688,3.5249,6.2942,0.0593,0.0337,1.6686,0.0451,0.3318,0.2461,0.8466,1.9515,4.1399,0.093,5.8902,0.8079,5.8279,2.4715,0.3513,3.2808,1.2309,0.0104,2.1985,4.5789,0.3325,5.9634,0.9828,1.6189,0.001,0.0068,0.3065,3.1627,0.0439,4.0821,2.6283,6.9832,0.6712,0.0616,1.569,1.4065,2.1525,1.7192,5.7802,0.5147,3.6673,0.4363,1.9091,15.0456,0.4512,9.8569,0.6562,3.5188,2.5166,5.6676,2.0196,1.8342,0.1571,1.3619,0.0006,0.0013,0.0143,0.3509,0.8149,0.2298,2.1173,0.2512,0.056,0.1881,0.2904,0.1938,2.0232,4.7097,4.0477,2.0567,6.9638,3.7363,0.7779,6.1478,7.9052,2.4099,0.335,1.5789,0.328,3.655,2.6205,0.376,6.2509,4.8086,1.2165,10.3524,1.3369,3.8283,1.4141,0.8346,6.0012,0.0381,1.0132,1.0208,0.0006,0.0004,0.4717,1.3003,0.2005,0.0818,0.4351]}

Mansae ! the people call as","text":"PYONGYANG - North Koreans stage a demonstration of devotion to their leader Kim Jong Un at least once a year, in a large ceremonial square in Pyongyang. Mansae! the people call as an acronym for \" my brother dearly \". Since 2005 an annual festival had been organized.\nWith a population of nearly 45 million people, North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world. Despite being an autocracy, there is no shortage of information flow into the country. The regime does take measures to filter such access as well as to ensure the distribution and quality of this information. It can be easily seen how this is implemented. For example, there is a great shortage of TVs and radios that function normally. Most people have only a handful of DVDs.\nIn addition, since the 1950s, the state controls the entire printing output. It has a close relationship with printers in India, the US and Europe, with which it frequently exchanges books and films. The country is also among the few countries in the world that does not have a television network broadcasting from Moscow.\nHowever, this does not mean that there is practically no media in the country. Although the regime is firmly in control of information, it is also possible to find information to challenge it. The so-called alternative media, among others, has made an important contribution to such critical views, which the official media could not suppress or deny. The most famous of the independent media, the Global Times magazine, has been an independent voice since the regime's establishment.\nIn addition to the independent media of course there is the state owned media. The main television network is operated under the direct control of the state. Apart from that there is also a state-owned radio network. The official newspapers are printed in Korean and printed in a bilingual format. Many are completely devoid of information and in the end only have to do with the daily life of the people, which they try to keep as entertaining as possible. Of particular interest is the National Newspaper of the DPRK, which always emphasizes the central role of the leader and which the regime itself has declared as its main objective of state ideology.\nThe state-controlled media in North Korea is mainly supported by the state.

{"prompt":"While 2017 saw the tide of the military conflict in Syria seemingly turn against Islamic State forces , the humanitarian crisis prompted by the conflict intensified in severity and in the breadth of the areas","text":"While 2017 saw the tide of the military conflict in Syria seemingly turn against Islamic State forces, the humanitarian crisis prompted by the conflict intensified in severity and in the breadth of the areas in which it was affecting civilians. It was also the year that Iran and Saudi Arabia, two key geopolitical stakeholders of the Sunni-Shiite world conflict, began to play more prominent roles in the conflict. The crisis in Syria and its humanitarian impact were a key focus of the UN General Assembly\u2019s 2017 UN World Humanitarian Summit, which was convened in conjunction with the 68th UN General Assembly. While the Syrian crisis had been an ongoing humanitarian crisis since 2011, when Syria was plunged into civil war, it had recently become a crisis of epidemic proportions, with tens of thousands of people seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.\nThe United Kingdom (UK) General Election. The general election of 2019 in the United Kingdom was held on 8 June 2019. The Conservative Party won the largest number of seats in parliament for a second time, securing a majority. The Conservatives were preceded by Labour with their largest ever majority in parliament from their victory at the 2011 general election. Conservative Dominic Raab was chosen as the Foreign Secretary. It was the first time since the 1980s that a Conservative government returned as UK prime minister and was the first time since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 1979 that a Conservative led coalition government was able to form. This election was the third of the four elections in a row in which major political parties failed to win at least fifty percent of the vote, the biggest gap of such a magnitude since the 1940s.\nThe United States (US) presidential election of 2020 was held on November 3. The candidate that has been in the spotlight, Donald Trump, faced an important turn against him, both inside and outside the country, and it was the last major political event before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. He was the incumbent president of this country, elected in 2016, and finished second in the 2020 race. A victory of the Democrats, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would have led to an unprecedented reversal, although the end of Trump\u2019s term makes this an uncertain and unusual situation. Nevertheless, the 2020 US presidential election was one of the most disputed and contested elections in American history. The result also marked a significant defeat for the right wing, represented by Donald Trump and his republican Party, which suffered multiple defeats, while the Democrats took considerable leaps in terms of representation in the state and national legislatures, the Congress of the United States of America.","token_len":514,"entropy":[9.3423,3.6689,1.0624,10.0726,1.0594,2.5487,6.3593,8.1017,2.5197,0.5518,7.9301,1.4709,1.9447,5.3375,0.0315,4.8132,0.5065,1.2764,7.0156,1.0129,6.9129,3.7278,0.4814,3.7373,4.928,2.5845,8.8118,1.8591,3.6531,2.642,7.7813,0.1039,0.9637,6.5829,3.4312,0.6198,1.6233,1.6115,6.8749,3.495,0.5149,4.2206,1.5237,2.297,1.8404,2.4589,1.7303,6.0318,2.3208,2.4547,0.0288,2.9095,2.6507,2.6855,5.3317,7.8123,4.1775,0.1949,4.3744,1.5188,0.5807,1.4363,0.0233,4.5297,8.4561,0.1359,2.9144,0.8594,4.2836,4.869,3.3192,0.1871,0.3367,0.9692,3.0607,0.6649,2.5691,5.6066,1.891,0.3259,3.2725,2.4624,4.9838,2.9477,2.6499,4.1595,2.5773,2.8748,0.519,0.8168,3.7238,3.3167,0.0028,14.1075,8.4433,4.6342,5.0695,4.3873,7.0799,5.657,0.1341,1.9182,1.7735,1.0909,1.3587,3.5581,0.5733,7.4596,0.0085,0.3375,9.213,0.152,2.5103,0.1584,0.0018,1.3336,4.5223,0.958,3.4798,1.9323,3.8057,2.0578,4.5366,2.6216,2.9113,0.9031,2.3378,2.059,0.1902,5.8472,4.0465,1.773,4.7108,0.0565,0.5256,0.0339,0.4171,1.8527,1.4053,4.4754,1.2386,0.861,5.6707,1.2117,8.883,0.0551,2.0054,1.208,4.8944,0.0192,0.2036,0.2664,0.5951,5.5367,1.3851,0.5518,3.6639,0.1974,0.8055,1.5136,7.7077,4.1281,4.4338,5.1222,0.7346,0.3225,8.6381,3.2496,4.9721,2.3154,3.8944,0.0785,1.8756,5.3118,3.1462,0.6173,1.5654,0.0011,1.7523,1.1682,0.517,3.9749,2.4975,3.6505,0.8118,1.1174,4.2055,0.2996,2.9132,1.4772,4.3168,1.6616,0.0049,0.3568,0.6049,3.1897,4.7278,1.9328,2.7531,0.7105,1.9781,3.9159,2.4781,0.9761,4.2302,1.1195,1.981,2.4625,8.5045,0.2069,1.7295,4.2264,4.8055,3.1454,2.9922,1.5346,1.6472,0.8279,5.6073,6.1633,4.5088,3.2463,0.4654,3.1499,0.6366,0.0613,0.3637,5.4328,10.2126,0.9733,0.0013,2.5758,4.5133,0.5814,0.881,8.1401,0.1708,1.4918,4.9163,0.4172,1.4,0.6719,0.3448,3.3221,1.6566,3.3186,0.1047,0.2573,1.0571,1.7985,1.7189,7.6633,5.7991,4.781,2.2488,0.0098,2.6588,2.5436,2.3709,0.366,0.2852,1.6251,4.7279,0.0004,9.343,1.3833,0.4588,3.3511,7.2414,0.7477,1.4318,7.8709,2.8213,0.8075,1.8407,2.6856,0.0083,2.9253,3.897,3.7344,2.7965,1.7574,1.6831,2.9702,4.2692,1.2532,3.4468,2.7854,1.7789,3.5015,0.2009,2.3027,0.2542,6.498,3.3261,0.0442,3.6278,0.1166,1.6383,4.5922,0.8621,7.3322,2.5537,0.0327,0.0823,0.4438,2.1633,3.9546,4.7028,4.7762,2.9905,7.4355,1.0178,5.7648,1.354,0.9316,4.573,0.0619,0.4295,1.5156,1.1966,2.2037,0.3464,0.7176,0.0251,0.1245,5.0117,0.1013,2.4588,3.1346,1.111,0.2315,0.098,6.993,4.0592,2.6848,0.8204,6.6291,3.5588,6.1388,2.1386,4.024,0.5607,2.9774,4.772,1.1846,0.1113,0.1621,4.7048,2.8586,6.7697,7.594,4.032,3.9837,2.2437,5.9006,5.508,0.2092,0.0726,0.5382,2.926,1.6558,2.6422,3.4086,0.6538,1.5681,4.6118,2.9864,2.5231,2.0079,2.4652,0.7075,4.5368,0.0031,0.3671,14.731,7.4383,10.9863,9.4628,11.5881,0.0076,1.3149,4.3285,1.9252,1.7764,6.794,1.5457,0.5648,8.1114,0.5134,1.5313,4.488,1.6587,3.3593,1.0322,0.9103,7.2534,1.396,0.8259,0.5374,8.833,5.1554,0.6932,4.4735,4.1711,4.0716,2.5078,4.8844,2.3543,8.984,0.174,2.1338,8.1468,0.0042,0.0012,0.8862,1.68,1.283,4.0843,0.4416,2.9333,2.1984,4.2014,4.5157,4.9839,1.7293,7.1258,0.8605,3.797,4.9269,0.1585,0.0131,2.5408,6.6452,1.5312,3.2867,4.5081,3.5648,5.5832,3.4292,0.5119,4.9135,0.0404,1.2025,8.085,4.0089,0.6248,0.202,1.2834,4.0533,0.354,0.1382,0.5088,8.379,1.9633,2.9911,0.9195,0.4763,2.7788,0.1666,0.6568,1.5995,4.6425,5.1477,2.943,1.3087,2.111,5.8998,0.1479,1.1228,5.1607,2.4742,2.6131,7.2567,0.2122,3.4543,0.0773,2.0007,1.857,8.5422,4.2356,1.0561,1.8638,5.4916,7.7347,0.7126,2.9635,4.4821,1.0604,2.3063,5.0934,6.6704,9.4315,2.6136,3.0584,0.0026,3.796,2.5089,0.8156,4.7098,3.3948,2.8488,1.3343,2.4211,3.947,6.5211,2.8126,1.5522,0.0919,0.0087,3.0122,0.0003,1.7117]}

{"prompt":"A prominent Australian opposition senator , Sam Dastyari , said on Tuesday he would resign from parliament after a series of allegations emerged about his links with Chinese-aligned interests in Australia . Relations between Australia","text":"A prominent Australian opposition senator, Sam Dastyari, said on Tuesday he would resign from parliament after a series of allegations emerged about his links with Chinese-aligned interests in Australia. Relations between Australia and China have worsened in recent months, after Beijing slapped a $US500 million ($709 million) export ban on Australian wheat as well other retaliatory tariffs on Australian wine, beef and barley. Dastyari won his seat in the Australian Senate in the March 2018 election by a mere one-point margin. Earlier in the year, he appeared to be on a roll. Dastyari had secured a seat as one of two non-partisan candidates for a Labor leadership spill. He took the lead in the poll with 58 per cent of supporters versus 42 per cent who supported fellow candidate Brendan Nelson, but the lead shrinking in recent months and Labor\u2019s preferred candidate, Mark Latham, finishing top of the poll late last year. The move to sack Dastyari wasn\u2019t formally announced until the end of the week, when the Australian media reported a letter he wrote to Chinese businessman Zhang Yiming. Dastyari said in the letter that he hadn\u2019t accepted money or other favours from the businessman but acknowledged the businessman\u2019s friendship. Dastyari later met Chinese ambassador to Australia Cui Tiankai later that day to discuss the content of the letter. After the meeting, Dastyari\u2019s assistant issued a statement saying that the ambassador didn\u2019t need to be informed of the content of the letter. Dastyari\u2019s departure comes as other senators in the conservative Liberal Party seek to distance themselves from the Chinese-aligned businessman. Across Australia, former Labor senators have questioned their ties to companies and organizations linked to Beijing. \u201cWe have a responsibility to tell the Australian public this story, to ensure that if Labor has a coalition government they know that the policies that they are trying to push through this country in some cases have been underpinned by business interests with a Chinese viewpoint,\u201d Sen. Simon Birmingham, who formerly led the Government\u2019s Senate Intelligence committee, told Australian media last month. \u201cAustralia needs a stable parliament,\u201d he added, \u201cand this is what this whole saga says to us in some rather disturbing and troubling ways.\u201d Dastyari has been criticised in recent months by multiple media outlets in Australia. The Federal Affairs Minister Christian Porter has also described Dastyari\u2019s connections to China as \u201cvery worrying\u201d in recent weeks..","token_len":514,"entropy":[10.2021,5.8373,7.3389,3.5335,1.4612,5.7512,0.1102,0.0024,0.0,0.2256,2.0016,2.8681,1.9902,2.0435,1.5467,3.9573,1.9052,1.6852,2.7961,2.762,2.2825,0.0007,3.2202,3.0464,1.6552,1.3254,4.4888,2.0223,7.0358,4.3547,6.8855,3.4,2.3292,2.016,0.3447,10.7979,0.2662,1.3969,0.1502,0.2357,0.5958,3.8531,1.601,0.0684,1.2796,1.1201,3.9922,1.9188,5.7608,1.6491,2.2033,5.2016,3.889,0.8078,2.16,7.8315,0.1214,0.0172,9.5875,0.4723,0.0719,3.2395,6.9103,5.2138,2.9881,11.7786,13.1263,0.0301,3.5177,1.0007,2.6329,4.4468,2.259,4.9608,0.2577,7.3575,0.6748,3.8866,0.0026,0.0035,6.7872,2.5517,0.5557,0.7957,1.67,3.2253,1.8463,0.9624,3.46,5.2328,4.3638,0.4369,3.5766,1.2157,6.2399,4.6086,2.7883,1.5757,0.0263,0.5691,5.3767,2.482,0.309,1.2067,0.2123,1.6638,5.1741,0.5367,2.5611,3.3641,2.3474,3.1405,3.0553,3.995,0.0066,0.0026,2.9721,7.3183,1.8276,1.5483,4.1809,4.7778,0.0188,3.1844,6.674,0.0257,3.7692,3.855,1.5732,2.6319,5.4479,2.5572,11.4968,2.5373,2.1233,5.1236,1.9166,2.665,0.7787,0.8702,4.7565,3.1946,4.7216,0.2444,0.0003,0.3067,9.2318,5.3862,4.0484,0.0223,0.0021,3.1997,3.1715,6.2765,4.3283,6.3637,5.2523,1.9116,4.2176,2.4631,5.3436,8.3728,2.5261,2.5465,1.5549,3.9397,6.1803,17.9244,10.7386,0.7959,5.3275,0.8924,1.7044,4.3131,3.3963,0.0985,0.1952,5.5149,6.3425,1.5935,0.1019,1.7121,8.5306,0.8511,1.8294,0.183,2.4106,6.4544,2.4611,6.0054,0.5936,0.001,0.0031,6.7374,7.2976,2.4854,0.7128,6.2497,0.3008,1.6869,2.7431,2.1045,0.0046,1.2489,1.6306,0.7519,2.3933,1.9912,2.6173,4.0215,1.3191,3.4178,4.0945,3.2599,1.9191,0.286,3.6255,3.9079,3.0042,3.3372,0.5608,2.9262,2.9447,2.533,0.0032,0.0011,2.8197,2.6168,1.8925,0.0474,0.4856,0.7275,5.6135,0.2299,0.2346,0.0773,5.7538,6.4097,3.1902,2.9699,4.1016,0.0003,0.2235,2.5415,3.188,3.7837,5.9096,2.6281,3.1006,5.0377,0.0143,0.0171,6.1024,1.7425,2.6456,0.004,0.0011,4.1398,5.0813,4.1624,4.2727,1.4802,0.3389,7.3392,1.0158,0.6392,3.0474,8.2858,1.3219,0.6765,2.8122,0.4498,1.0993,9.5856,0.4803,0.6276,0.4672,0.586,4.7026,1.4851,0.3513,0.1369,0.8351,0.0012,0.0009,4.2647,0.0052,0.0444,7.0326,7.6194,0.2602,0.2923,1.0062,1.7484,1.6094,3.9799,4.4274,0.0459,0.0664,0.1022,6.2167,0.4202,2.2434,2.9339,0.8787,0.533,4.4209,0.1031,0.271,0.1185,1.0558,2.3529,0.0033,0.001,0.8343,0.0027,0.0403,7.1818,2.9199,1.6821,5.1158,3.8996,3.394,0.9884,6.456,2.6883,0.7727,4.8586,0.2669,4.2324,0.0117,0.0192,1.3026,2.5954,2.6259,3.1458,6.3579,0.8795,9.1356,1.7222,0.2095,4.2215,1.9959,4.4559,3.5118,5.5822,4.2401,4.2134,0.438,6.9851,3.0968,5.0302,2.1516,0.041,2.9872,0.9728,9.7301,4.8287,8.4507,1.9843,2.6515,2.9426,0.3095,4.2924,1.1896,2.94,1.642,4.9752,3.7903,1.7009,2.3772,4.0904,0.9964,6.0624,6.9926,4.4033,1.6724,6.27,0.543,3.772,4.9258,2.0466,2.6853,5.5392,1.8021,1.8431,1.8891,3.7207,0.0068,3.5774,1.6523,4.6687,3.5296,4.7442,5.7105,3.7161,2.5579,1.5048,8.8063,0.0032,0.0998,4.4652,0.288,5.5884,2.451,3.8534,6.7411,1.9911,7.7288,7.8569,9.2777,0.3654,5.8371,0.94,1.0843,1.4222,6.7606,3.789,0.3469,6.0641,7.4197,0.184,0.0059,4.9728,6.7868,5.0797,0.2376,1.431,4.6945,2.4135,2.1166,1.0627,0.5428,2.9429,0.2488,5.543,2.4613,2.5265,5.5185,4.1863,1.6575,1.7436,1.7444,1.4708,1.4284,2.0056,3.0085,0.4309,0.7544,3.4612,1.3656,1.7733,3.2512,4.8902,2.1455,7.1539,3.3708,1.2297,4.8304,4.9531,9.7787,3.6123,3.9091,3.1407,0.3702,0.5719,1.8996,1.7393,3.8924,0.0134,0.0018,2.8024,1.6744,5.2113,2.3374,1.0988,0.9347,2.5898,7.0656,3.2272,0.3919,4.3691,0.6161,3.1394,2.4261,4.3537,7.9059,1.8033,7.8379,0.124,2.1937,3.1851,5.2334,1.4951,0.0008,0.0019,1.5786,0.1143,0.0082,5.4873,0.8333,1.4156,0.1656,9.3737,0.7271,3.327,3.4976,0.9985,0.7817,3.9996,4.3561,1.2759,9.5191]}

The Venezuelan people deserve the right to express their opinions freely, the State Department said, urging the Venezuelan leader to respect that right. He [ Maduro ] must step back from his threats to allow Venezuelans to choose democratically their leaders, the State Department said. The State Department said that a peaceful process that preserves Venezuelans s rights to participate freely should be promoted. The U.S. Department of State said that it was disconcerted that Maduro has yet again resorted to unlawful threats to stop political disaffection and has repeatedly urged him to refrain from such threats. Maduro did not take into account the will of the Venezuelan people or the wish of the international community to work to find a peaceful solution, the American officials said. Venezuelans should be allowed to express their opinions freely, the State Department said. Maduro has yet again resorted to unlawful threats to stop political disaffection, and has repeatedly urged him to refrain from such threats, the U.S. officials said. The State Department said that a peaceful process that preserves Venezuelans s rights to participate freely should be promoted, and urged Maduro to step back from his threats to allow Venezuelans to choose democratically their leaders. The American officials called for Maduro to restore calm and allow opposition leaders to participate in presidential elections next year, and for Venezuelans to engage in a free and peaceful transition of power. Washington is ready to work with Venezuelans and the international community to support an orderly peaceful transition of power, the State Department said, but we must avoid violence and extremism. The U.S. embassy in Caracas will hold a meeting of Venezuelan business leaders seeking ways to increase confidence in the current political system and the ability of Venezuela to transition to a democratic regime as soon as possible through elections. The State Department said the U.S. embassy team and State Department experts will be meeting Monday with the Venezuelan National Business Council in Caracas, a business association that has condemned threats to Venezuelan elections. It may take months before Maduro s threats actually stop Venezuelans from participating in presidential and legislative elections next year, the State Department officials said. Maduro has repeatedly said next Year s election will be the last that oppositional candidates will be allowed to participate because he denies opposition candidates have won any primary elections. The State Department said in recent days that Maduro, the vice president, and the Venezuelan National Assembly s speaker are blocking the return of three opposition members who were expelled from the assembly.","token_len":515,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2865,0.0161,4.6508,1.8928,4.5571,8.0932,0.3608,0.1608,0.0,11.4956,6.9342,0.5276,4.9527,7.0438,4.0723,1.1761,2.5576,0.0362,4.0461,0.946,10.6182,3.2428,0.3364,0.6783,3.0885,2.962,5.9296,4.787,2.8072,1.3788,0.0465,4.411,0.1894,1.7745,1.9746,1.2151,2.2519,2.4006,0.0067,0.1134,2.9126,4.6808,1.586,1.2129,4.8238,0.2045,3.4202,4.5418,1.0385,0.5294,6.4395,9.1418,7.7735,0.377,2.9241,4.7082,4.1992,0.6507,0.7148,2.17,1.3246,5.2835,4.5801,0.0041,0.2276,3.03,6.947,3.213,2.801,1.5178,1.0034,0.7604,0.0075,0.0801,0.5044,2.2354,3.1043,0.008,1.6438,1.909,3.9661,5.5034,3.4528,4.5969,4.7432,6.785,0.0122,10.1226,2.2598,2.2125,3.3817,5.4102,3.9746,0.9292,4.8932,2.0444,1.8712,1.5432,0.0007,0.0076,0.0461,4.0549,0.2451,0.0487,1.3388,0.8933,2.5677,2.226,7.4769,1.9546,2.0374,1.2321,2.1097,2.2078,4.8779,3.7341,5.1374,0.0088,8.0392,2.232,1.2313,4.1977,3.1027,10.3669,2.7243,0.3514,2.5383,4.2723,4.8134,4.4027,4.8218,0.1648,4.4037,0.0311,2.8878,3.1184,0.3317,3.687,4.9081,0.1587,4.2032,5.8429,0.218,0.9186,7.715,0.054,0.484,0.5153,0.0298,3.2574,0.6387,7.9898,0.2206,0.6676,4.5025,0.01,1.1929,5.0611,2.7054,5.1041,0.5508,1.5759,0.318,3.023,0.4582,7.2582,3.5099,0.1055,0.1722,7.0851,0.0147,2.366,1.9701,2.9104,0.1289,1.3347,0.0785,0.9134,0.1607,0.8262,0.3344,0.2052,0.0067,0.0545,0.3803,3.3273,2.6948,3.5879,0.5372,0.1957,0.0006,0.0663,0.0104,0.0189,0.0126,0.0238,0.0053,0.0003,0.014,5.4416,2.5451,0.1487,0.0244,0.1077,0.0095,0.0041,0.0018,0.0003,0.0041,0.0051,4.5301,0.23,2.2474,0.0006,0.0092,0.0017,0.1629,0.0205,0.0525,2.1436,2.9501,0.0074,0.2728,0.2967,1.0143,0.0114,0.0114,0.0022,0.0213,0.1567,0.0007,0.108,0.0012,0.001,0.0018,0.0003,0.0022,0.0014,0.0006,6.7286,1.499,3.9972,1.8059,0.1161,0.3771,0.0139,0.0071,0.0306,0.0269,0.0053,0.0283,0.036,0.0007,0.0021,0.0218,0.3616,0.0015,0.0023,3.335,2.1111,3.9732,0.1175,5.0459,1.1735,2.7191,0.2796,5.9191,3.3649,1.0085,3.7273,3.3216,2.2666,0.2402,2.2302,0.6725,3.7941,0.0681,2.7753,0.0661,1.2809,2.0748,2.5124,3.1358,0.0049,0.2845,5.979,0.2551,2.487,2.8743,0.62,3.3323,4.4358,3.0144,0.0483,0.6481,6.8202,2.9084,4.4079,0.2219,1.9647,0.2506,4.8324,0.0214,2.5968,2.1978,0.4436,0.0022,0.2891,4.3319,3.8275,1.6215,6.5477,0.3873,0.6553,0.0406,0.7951,0.381,1.1464,0.0066,0.0665,2.3987,3.1446,5.0246,2.2456,4.2974,4.2513,1.0952,3.3275,1.453,1.4224,1.0315,0.0007,0.005,0.0098,5.9325,0.3149,1.868,0.0002,5.1434,3.1945,0.7096,1.5425,2.0402,3.9721,6.4529,0.3975,8.8112,4.6535,0.2474,5.0133,4.6448,0.3993,0.7051,5.6016,1.6179,1.7708,1.451,3.0361,3.8474,0.4077,3.8413,0.4737,4.1211,0.6241,0.4944,1.5913,4.0643,5.6554,1.1054,0.0012,0.0421,7.6952,4.093,1.1238,1.1632,2.9688,0.0075,0.8766,2.1323,1.697,0.0007,0.0035,0.0268,2.293,7.8081,4.1891,6.5293,0.1126,3.9622,1.3609,2.6215,1.2651,5.3277,1.4356,2.6569,1.1185,5.56,8.5705,0.31,4.035,0.9237,0.0005,2.0139,3.8418,4.7788,3.6747,1.1175,1.9154,8.037,5.2418,1.1786,4.1975,4.0691,1.0383,3.3281,6.8876,2.1139,3.4263,2.3966,4.3438,4.9893,5.4357,8.2781,2.7617,6.7863,0.0036,0.5891,1.799,0.2581,2.1803,5.9744,2.1125,0.0365,3.6306,0.0217,0.5199,0.3185,0.6215,0.0051,3.6622,0.0279,0.0578,3.4883,1.4791,2.2887,3.3315,11.0086,8.2391,4.2018,2.1433,1.385,0.2856,3.6205,2.4409,4.9453,12.7504,1.2555,3.4492,1.4723,1.2773,1.3135,0.0901,1.7904,5.5249,3.0213,6.8937,5.0203,3.1679,5.0232,4.5459,2.1842,7.6347,1.9528,0.6977,1.1072,1.8758,0.0074,0.6409,3.6918,4.8511,0.7773,0.2886,2.1133,4.4834,3.5149,5.1037,0.2013,0.9243,1.4195,1.8535,4.6867,1.6755,2.1907,6.2858,7.5872,2.867,6.2938,1.4153,5.7108,0.057,5.6655,2.2735,2.7655,2.3946,1.6633,3.597,0.7715,0.6066,2.7229,2.2305]}

{"prompt":"Poland should defend its national identity and interests at a time when the European Union is debating its own future , the country s new Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told parliament on Tuesday . Warsaw","text":"Poland should defend its national identity and interests at a time when the European Union is debating its own future, the country s new Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told parliament on Tuesday. Warsaw has repeatedly said its opposition to the EU s move to grant visa-free access to Belarusian citizens. \" I think that the Polish government and parliament should defend our national identity, interests and identity of our state,\" Morawiecki said in a speech to Polish lawmakers as he outlined his policy proposals. But the government said its policy toward Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was not overruled, and neither it nor the Polish parliament has rejected the visa exemption. Poland s government said it would maintain the visa-free status for Belarusian diplomats and officials only. Lukashenko, a longtime critic of the West for human rights issues, has rejected the move in a telephone conversation with the new Polish prime minister. But Morawiecki said, with the support of Lukashenko, that an important factor was to maintain the state s sovereignty in the face of international pressure for action. \"We are aware that Belarusian diplomats and officials, who regularly have to pass through the [Polish] embassy in Minsk, will remain able to enter Poland without visas,\" said Morawiecki, speaking at a news conference that also included an account of his call with Lukashenko. But he noted the Belarusian s role in the international crisis over democracy in the European Union, with Lukashenko \"presenting the reality of it s going on on his TV\" on Tuesday. The government said it would not call on the Polish parliament to support the visa exemption, though it had asked parliament to review any EU action that could harm Poland s sovereignty. On Monday, the EU Commission said the visa exemption could happen after it had completed an internal dialogue. The commission said at the time that it wanted to avoid possible risks to the credibility of the visa-free right and it would \"strongly consider\" any possible changes to its travel regime in the future. It added that the Commission would monitor its implementation and that a decision had be taken by October. Belarus has called on the EU to remove its visa-free right for European citizens in the wake of the parliamentary elections in Poland, where a new anti-government coalition has been elected. Lukashenko says his country does not support changes to the visa-free right, but is willing to discuss other issues like visa-free visits by other groups from Belarus.

The event, held at the Cathedral of Saint Patrick in Washington, included readings from texts from the Koran and hymns.\nIn his closing remarks, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York City, noted that the people he had to minister to from victims to survivors did not look like the men and woman the perpetrators described online using the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, nor were they from any particular ethnic and sectarian background. And he described them as \u201cfreedom fighters. They were not terrorists at all. \u201d\nThe funeral was part of a series of events to mark the 30th anniversary of the attacks, the deadliest act of terrorism targeting the United States in its history. It ended with a vigil at the Pentagon that featured a reading of the Koran and a prayer from Pakistani actor Asad Qaiser. Many, however, came for something more.\nNadine M. and Thomas G. were among those who came from New Jersey to Washington and said they wanted to be part of a national process to mourn the victims and their families, and to encourage people to learn more about the attacks. Nadine, who was in Newark, said that while New York City had had a large role in organizing the memorials, she felt that those events had lacked a universal perspective, without people from all corners of the United States.\n\u201cWhat we didn\u2019t have here were Muslims there, there were Jews there, there were Irish there, there were Italians there, there were Americans there,\u201d she said. \u201cHere\u2019s a memorial that represents us all.\u201d\nShe was among a few who sat down to watch the evening performance by pop superstar Jennifer Lopez to songs from the cast of The Bodyguard, the film that won an Oscar for its story about a woman who rescues the bodyguard of a teenager who was murdered.\nJennifer was invited to perform at the event because of her role in raising funds for the victims and their families. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d said M. \u201cI just saw the pictures of her and I wanted to show my support.\u201d","token_len":515,"entropy":[7.5171,4.431,3.3891,2.3387,4.7601,1.5048,1.3868,5.7414,0.4087,0.0093,2.6773,3.334,7.4141,5.2027,1.9654,1.4136,6.2007,8.1123,7.2095,1.8405,0.8502,0.8637,0.7404,5.7551,8.8208,1.893,9.4687,1.39,6.788,0.2746,0.1778,9.7024,0.1296,0.1599,4.0384,2.9837,1.1118,3.2649,6.6169,1.5204,2.5112,0.158,4.6667,3.0094,1.6883,2.0687,0.8896,0.9848,0.3469,3.0413,0.003,0.0021,0.7293,0.0303,0.1895,0.5865,2.5268,0.2785,2.174,0.0003,0.0021,11.4997,9.8514,2.4343,2.8136,1.5681,1.6403,0.4836,0.6847,5.8575,0.196,2.7238,4.1338,0.9265,4.8201,0.3435,3.5777,7.2532,1.3013,7.5475,1.7291,1.0776,3.1692,1.0082,7.3147,0.0622,0.0,2.6746,0.3792,15.7607,2.717,4.573,0.4989,0.1787,4.5904,2.2974,0.2029,0.0013,1.3409,1.05,0.9817,0.0298,0.0712,0.2295,0.2504,3.1882,0.098,4.6336,0.5387,1.3931,4.9306,4.2601,2.6367,5.6098,9.1037,0.1107,6.0651,9.0608,5.9621,2.8801,5.7413,0.4344,3.9346,1.9225,1.4062,5.3705,0.9078,6.2981,7.1899,5.2922,3.4132,8.2243,8.6686,1.2016,4.6594,1.6612,3.5214,0.0039,0.0314,0.9834,0.0048,3.9269,3.0859,1.3889,0.0038,0.6214,0.1397,0.049,0.395,0.0393,1.8636,6.416,2.4909,0.163,4.0928,3.3512,3.688,3.1831,4.1736,3.8992,2.97,0.121,6.2789,0.5966,4.5812,1.6003,0.1888,14.0294,6.5479,10.3315,0.0683,3.7405,4.6523,0.8213,1.4343,2.0812,5.3402,0.024,0.4437,4.1238,6.4544,0.9514,2.2957,6.8283,2.3632,4.7875,0.0078,0.5801,3.2654,0.2536,1.6641,3.5363,1.205,0.3567,3.6985,0.2194,0.0073,0.0243,0.2073,2.0261,1.3598,3.0903,5.8014,6.0602,0.3368,0.7967,7.3734,1.4933,0.5771,0.0023,1.593,3.9466,0.5333,0.3672,3.8693,5.8953,0.8784,1.4358,3.3496,1.5728,0.5955,3.5405,3.6965,3.6872,1.5541,6.1814,0.8728,0.2884,0.2878,1.2862,1.099,1.8762,2.8341,9.1795,6.959,3.1957,5.5155,3.0559,5.4508,6.9731,0.7206,6.012,5.1182,3.6749,0.0022,4.4996,4.1202,7.3882,1.1078,1.6065,0.6326,6.1413,3.9637,0.6261,5.0799,1.1392,6.4832,5.5884,3.5474,0.1809,8.1121,1.7365,0.9133,1.3245,3.2337,4.3702,4.1506,0.3481,1.2792,5.1887,3.4629,4.6979,0.5166,2.6529,0.2105,3.2745,1.4127,0.001,1.2692,3.4532,6.6956,0.9468,5.1277,0.7188,1.3939,2.1596,1.707,0.2073,2.0687,1.8826,1.1604,4.3459,2.9829,0.6294,4.654,1.0236,0.0525,0.9603,2.914,1.0132,8.1668,0.0026,2.3614,1.1311,1.7899,4.0732,6.125,2.2701,0.9993,2.0949,3.2914,6.2884,2.5417,1.7106,2.1762,4.3233,1.2941,4.3465,6.532,0.252,4.5862,0.5438,1.1298,3.7621,0.5884,1.8961,2.6676,1.4009,4.5398,3.1074,1.833,6.1445,1.9936,5.9597,4.0852,2.8626,6.5519,6.1807,3.0881,2.2426,3.1872,0.0816,0.1143,2.8961,0.0073,1.7767,0.4957,6.1606,3.7941,8.7982,2.2974,5.0576,9.7783,9.7816,1.7112,1.5857,5.2448,2.7784,5.8958,6.4738,1.5949,5.0316,0.806,4.8585,0.648,0.3558,1.0325,0.1841,4.7649,1.8501,0.4932,1.4811,0.1847,1.9904,0.4184,0.5797,1.3824,0.1217,3.5858,0.5717,0.8015,8.3636,3.0713,1.4355,0.1397,0.1798,2.7385,1.8832,7.057,3.0956,1.0879,2.0421,1.9341,4.6811,1.6608,4.8052,4.8571,1.256,1.3387,2.2722,1.529,0.4702,3.1413,3.5608,2.8501,2.1449,3.647,0.8415,4.904,2.2057,2.0799,3.1932,0.7037,4.9407,8.1476,3.0483,7.4984,4.3214,4.8234,0.1253,5.6361,10.1011,0.9847,0.9201,7.9244,0.2064,2.4757,4.4242,0.8337,1.0052,2.2997,3.4295,1.3276,4.1953,2.761,0.8036,0.3141,5.3579,5.63,2.4935,1.024,4.8362,0.6313,6.4636,0.0026,3.1216,1.7317,3.7207,2.881,0.5273,6.051,0.86,1.6286,2.1227,1.9839,0.9963,6.8057,3.7632,7.1813,0.2746,3.096,2.3693,0.1772,2.6995,3.7949,2.0991,0.4765,2.6628,0.8462,6.3187,2.8512,0.1927,0.9185,2.9943,2.1647,1.2877,0.0321,0.9928,4.202,1.1187,4.1513,4.4062,0.8211,0.9218,0.0174,2.0558,2.1959,1.1213,1.5321,1.6902,1.2127,1.4503,2.2716,2.2931,1.0838,2.4847,0.6908,2.6122,3.7272,2.7761,1.5309,5.0163,1.4897,1.826,1.6242,2.2877,2.2744,0.0744,3.6809,2.4328,1.5247,1.5947,1.8655,0.4381]}

But both sides have remained mum over how far they can move toward a deal.\nIn a letter to the British Foreign Office, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said progress would need to be made on specific points on immigration and the environment, before any conclusion could be reached.\nThe British government said it was \u201cstill fully committed to this path\u201d, adding it had made a number of proposals which, if adopted, would be on the table for an EU statement to come out later on Sunday.\nBut there was no sign of progress in talks at a meeting in Brussels of ministers from the 23 EU member states in charge of negotiations with Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nBritain voted to abandon the EU in June and now has until 31 January to get in line for its departure. The date is a compromise and does not mean there is a firm end to Brexit talks.\nPrime Minister Johnson announced in July that a final deal with the EU was a priority and he has made clear that no compromises would be made on fundamental issues.\nThe Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said no progress on the three issues which had divided the EU and the UK, on fishing and agriculture, border controls and services, would stop talks.\n\u201cWhat we know is the EU is still trying to make the same offers on agriculture and fisheries and our approach is that they can\u2019t use those issues as bargaining chips. That\u2019s out of all proportion and we want to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nScottish First Minister Alex Salmond said the only thing that would \u201cdrive us back is an unnecessarily protracted break on the issue of Northern Ireland.\u201d\nThe European Parliament declared on Saturday that Britain could be held accountable for the damage the no-deal departure would do to the EU, and accused Johnson\u2019s government of \u201cshowing a total lack of political will\u201d in the talks.","token_len":515,"entropy":[8.4271,3.7059,8.0356,3.8244,0.0017,0.7511,0.0,0.0004,0.0,2.2182,2.4772,6.6018,0.6375,4.3349,1.3949,5.3233,3.1057,0.0077,0.0592,1.4501,0.0199,2.3929,0.8296,5.2174,11.6504,7.7996,8.6332,0.4974,0.1265,3.9353,3.627,0.0445,1.5471,1.7435,4.8563,1.0583,4.0934,0.7595,0.2308,0.5527,0.4953,22.0431,1.0155,0.0035,10.1545,0.0023,4.5112,1.8577,4.7799,0.0751,0.0007,0.0003,1.8265,0.855,2.5474,0.3045,5.9783,2.6155,0.002,1.6354,1.0011,0.1,0.0105,12.1631,1.1176,1.8124,2.1378,0.4138,1.7118,5.0677,2.6416,0.303,3.1669,1.2395,1.8076,5.3613,1.99,1.9554,2.1816,1.762,5.5224,2.6955,5.8482,2.2958,4.4754,3.4939,0.6784,0.2444,3.7975,2.3127,6.4791,8.3895,1.1744,0.0013,4.7621,3.6147,0.4959,0.1493,9.1271,3.2045,5.7761,1.3163,3.9943,6.8851,3.8119,0.6111,3.4266,2.2717,0.7579,1.9936,3.5346,11.1785,3.415,1.565,1.8503,2.6731,2.33,4.2597,4.4342,0.9654,3.4289,2.9532,2.4204,3.7974,4.8112,0.1999,1.6458,4.709,3.4615,2.3604,2.0701,3.4472,1.1319,3.2194,3.7265,4.8759,0.8024,0.8712,1.0367,0.1534,4.4299,1.3881,3.2484,0.4052,1.6377,3.4058,4.3011,0.6579,0.923,3.9659,3.6477,3.4143,0.2022,0.0001,0.0,0.6794,6.8641,2.8974,3.8825,0.1282,0.1989,0.3008,1.5788,6.6293,3.9963,3.8275,3.8479,1.3672,1.9701,5.0449,1.5057,3.6392,2.7726,6.5479,0.4306,0.0723,0.1432,0.3504,0.2252,2.178,4.0157,0.9432,2.7563,1.0582,1.4052,15.171,6.6632,4.3376,5.5174,0.5549,0.4138,4.4754,5.3254,1.9856,8.2213,3.0887,3.2962,2.632,2.4537,3.4815,2.9403,1.9868,0.0023,4.8119,4.4556,4.6238,1.5957,3.1363,0.2354,0.2928,2.1816,5.3196,1.0844,0.6753,1.459,4.5211,1.9522,7.5117,3.7658,3.9679,1.4132,2.7916,2.1556,2.0163,0.2033,0.2394,3.6788,3.8914,1.4239,1.1115,1.9217,1.0438,1.1919,2.4228,2.8937,3.6741,3.3188,1.8497,2.0137,0.7829,4.2264,3.3758,1.6641,1.0471,5.8924,1.6882,0.9504,0.0177,2.4963,8.9552,0.004,3.6191,3.1343,7.8052,1.1857,0.7806,0.0098,0.7153,0.3151,4.3534,6.2128,0.5454,9.3928,0.5932,1.6227,1.5386,1.1812,2.2703,3.4399,1.6996,4.5733,4.1939,2.6796,0.7818,4.3621,5.3493,0.6477,1.743,4.1466,3.6678,0.8081,3.1196,5.5232,1.5335,3.2571,5.3366,4.8719,4.7648,0.0292,2.599,3.0083,0.7814,1.3276,5.0846,3.8496,0.6227,2.5229,1.2526,0.6371,0.3504,5.033,0.0386,3.84,5.7052,2.6228,3.0612,0.298,3.6785,3.3617,0.548,3.7367,0.4547,0.7524,1.4705,4.3897,1.949,2.6241,2.5478,2.8493,3.5946,1.8599,0.5216,4.4463,6.7317,1.8432,0.2558,1.7741,1.7649,7.2864,0.3566,1.2748,0.4584,2.2403,4.0784,2.3622,1.4917,0.5158,0.0023,0.0498,1.4384,6.6034,3.9351,2.8754,1.2376,5.8118,2.1694,7.0461,2.9444,3.4817,0.8935,2.2966,3.1989,2.0837,0.463,3.528,6.5554,9.0245,1.9016,2.7158,0.3734,6.4638,0.5713,0.403,6.401,1.5774,1.4764,5.3253,6.063,1.2399,0.4303,8.2949,1.491,6.6245,2.2436,2.4729,2.8431,3.0439,3.2568,1.3645,3.2404,3.4602,0.089,3.5786,2.6004,4.9675,8.4406,2.9465,4.8491,1.2159,1.3874,2.1205,5.0423,5.2348,1.7552,2.8356,2.8169,3.5167,13.6608,9.1822,0.4268,6.2271,2.6052,4.3812,1.5303,1.6906,0.0417,1.3973,3.1747,4.0752,1.3573,1.5128,7.5832,0.5242,6.2072,5.5511,3.9697,1.9418,3.0726,0.4245,2.0911,0.325,3.5196,2.3366,1.6142,0.3116,0.2503,1.5377,1.2082,4.1561,6.6094,0.9023,6.7598,0.0046,1.8573,0.0556,2.6403,0.014,0.0,1.4339,1.8538,5.4988,2.8971,1.2114,1.7508,12.9123,0.7182,6.4619,2.1484,3.0871,2.1959,3.5618,8.5698,4.798,6.4276,5.149,1.5326,2.4936,0.3484,4.7855,0.057,0.9377,4.4014,3.0147,0.3761,2.5561,4.0459,2.1271,7.4321,2.2004,2.5139,0.3344,4.3131,2.3554,4.1189,5.2098,3.7782,0.416,2.028,4.7942,3.5362,8.477,1.0814,0.1291,10.2181,0.7824,0.6788,0.1776,0.9397,2.1712,2.3532,2.1024,6.8217,5.2157,3.4806,0.7832,0.1964,0.5791,0.0707,8.6359,0.2504,4.9627,1.2894,2.3266,6.0083,0.7227,0.0092,4.4062,0.3206,2.3637,3.4805,3.3784,1.9401,4.7269,0.5773]}
{"prompt":"The latest U.N. sanctions against North Korea are an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade against it , North Korea s foreign ministry said on Sunday , threatening to punish those","text":"The latest U.N. sanctions against North Korea are an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade against it, North Korea s foreign ministry said on Sunday, threatening to punish those who violate the resolution. The sanctions, imposed amid tensions on the North s nuclear and missile programs, will go into effect beginning next week, the U.N. Security Council said. They include a freeze on transactions on the financial and oil sectors, bans on trading across the border with China and restrictions on travel to North Korea. \"The U.N. Security Council has finally decided to go down that anti-North Korean path, which is an act of war in nature. This is a clear provocation and an affront to international law,\" South Korea s foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday. The sanctions have been proposed by the U.S. in November and passed by U.N. members in December. They target the foreign transfers, trade and travel which could generate the economic resources needed by North Korea for weapons research and development. China, the U.S. ally in the North Korean crisis, has said the sanctions would affect people s livelihoods and could threaten regional security, while Pyongyang has described them as a total economic war. The U.S. and China announced last week that they planned to meet at the start of next week to discuss how to end the crisis. They did not provide details on how the talks would lead to the end of the crisis. Beijing and Washington have stepped up their military ties in response to North Korea s testing of a nuclear device earlier this year. North Korea has repeatedly been accused of violating its international obligations and repeatedly rejected such accusations. Pyongyang is still refusing to allow inspectors from the U.N., the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit its sites. U.N. sanctions against North Korea come after it detonated its second nuclear device in two weeks early this month, despite strong international pressure and promises of swift retaliation. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was also recently reported to have died, likely in September. His death has sparked speculation and fears both here and in North Korea over what will happen next. Earlier this week, in his last public address at a national meeting in which he praised his accomplishments, his health was not mentioned and he also took credit for North Korea s economic growth. The announcement prompted speculation that Kim Jong Il was not ill and that the leader might have been replaced by a new bodyguard. Sources close to his family say his death will be announced this month.","token_len":516,"entropy":[7.7734,6.7816,0.0836,2.9527,0.0483,5.2748,2.0913,2.8779,0.015,1.9215,4.5776,3.6739,0.106,0.898,2.7289,7.7232,0.0015,0.0035,1.4391,4.7157,4.9182,1.6755,2.7557,4.6051,1.5849,5.8661,0.1623,11.0656,9.8477,0.6547,0.7058,1.4415,2.2212,1.6318,5.8371,0.8089,4.1424,3.1701,0.6876,3.4211,1.0825,3.8253,0.6767,3.3992,2.8422,2.1545,3.2258,5.4455,3.8766,4.0987,0.1495,5.2103,7.8723,1.7009,1.009,0.5551,0.912,0.1466,3.1702,4.0532,0.0892,0.0322,5.3866,2.4677,0.7165,1.3447,1.1349,2.9985,0.0007,0.033,0.2349,1.4417,0.0008,0.5054,0.7586,4.4545,2.3834,1.7346,2.6786,0.1916,5.9264,4.2326,0.9992,6.625,1.7925,2.7568,2.1795,1.039,3.9141,0.0258,5.2715,6.9381,1.0136,1.4308,4.3651,1.8316,0.6496,3.1922,0.0231,3.555,1.2035,2.0366,0.0234,0.7643,3.3611,1.4608,2.3783,0.0007,0.062,0.072,1.0868,0.0009,1.9851,6.9215,2.845,0.6061,5.342,4.3549,2.9889,6.9145,0.0262,2.0233,1.2845,1.4951,2.2945,2.0978,1.097,3.741,1.4041,0.0153,0.4028,4.2979,7.4968,3.3304,2.2667,1.0256,1.1295,3.1907,4.2986,2.4741,2.3766,4.7524,0.0002,0.1189,2.7451,0.287,0.6789,4.0033,0.8091,10.8491,0.9091,0.1758,0.8185,0.2855,0.0483,0.0568,2.5917,0.6739,0.2709,1.6113,2.3283,3.1239,1.0402,6.2163,0.6425,0.9201,1.6104,0.0006,1.7498,0.897,3.3437,6.8065,1.7748,4.4692,1.0342,5.4291,0.0008,0.0885,0.0438,4.8449,2.1006,1.4319,0.516,3.1801,3.8908,2.9919,7.3709,7.9051,3.4856,4.1541,0.2951,5.8188,7.5544,4.0898,5.6105,4.244,4.1885,6.9248,1.217,3.6675,0.973,0.0578,2.473,4.8897,5.0242,0.7761,0.1757,0.6681,4.174,1.9067,2.0191,1.4947,0.0004,0.1732,0.5179,2.6691,4.0403,0.2947,2.715,2.2466,3.9045,0.1588,0.99,2.2239,2.1132,0.9397,2.1152,4.8346,7.3374,8.2173,1.9743,0.1257,0.9726,3.9933,4.3527,4.4003,1.3563,2.596,2.9673,2.9127,0.6999,4.8533,1.225,0.0309,0.869,7.9957,2.6418,2.2686,0.7099,1.4832,1.0791,0.0004,1.3652,0.1874,2.093,2.3222,5.6043,2.4484,1.0664,0.5262,0.4483,4.6738,0.0688,5.2893,4.0123,0.7458,5.002,0.0027,2.1511,0.8035,0.5946,0.3995,2.8241,0.2574,4.2075,0.1636,1.8953,0.6794,4.3083,4.2801,0.0318,3.2864,0.9025,1.4386,1.9632,1.6631,1.2697,0.847,5.3284,0.1789,2.2968,3.3592,0.0797,0.1871,1.5561,0.6312,4.7721,2.2874,0.6348,0.732,5.6607,0.0253,1.074,2.6813,6.1293,2.895,2.8338,0.0366,1.9785,0.1382,2.9315,8.5987,0.2761,0.8536,1.8447,2.3963,3.567,0.0257,0.7809,0.5887,2.8765,0.1184,1.2067,2.9898,5.2401,1.5456,0.1142,3.6093,2.4353,3.3587,0.4941,1.9954,6.6471,4.9268,4.3439,1.9128,0.6904,4.0577,3.6238,4.625,5.7073,0.0602,3.2532,5.2941,1.4887,0.4674,1.1853,0.0006,0.2363,1.8604,1.6351,3.7238,0.0968,1.0915,0.0096,0.0121,0.1373,0.0083,0.9413,1.0992,1.649,0.1985,0.0001,0.0001,0.3403,0.8523,1.0436,4.5103,0.9655,3.3494,0.0006,0.4562,0.0307,2.4556,2.5615,0.3451,0.0114,4.4924,1.4741,3.0433,6.8852,2.2292,2.9869,0.864,0.9911,1.0372,5.4637,0.7043,5.1186,0.7766,0.5772,1.3263,6.4861,5.0432,1.6875,1.3401,2.474,6.0558,1.9084,4.7359,5.3317,0.5543,2.7094,2.3274,1.0895,0.0097,0.0062,4.6914,3.927,3.9402,4.0409,2.9157,0.1506,0.3514,5.9949,3.2628,6.8818,1.9003,8.3916,0.9602,5.3977,1.6396,2.0108,2.0097,3.0853,4.9118,3.6279,6.7985,7.9208,0.1079,0.6031,2.6508,0.0334,3.7224,2.5577,2.6753,0.2482,1.6652,0.339,5.1449,0.2533,1.6788,0.2027,4.9843,4.0263,3.6062,2.1286,1.5656,5.2337,1.5909,4.3376,2.8191,2.1415,4.2735,0.1822,5.1322,2.4616,8.2165,0.768,5.2224,4.4999,1.8995,3.9146,2.4583,2.9844,1.3312,4.3238,4.7274,5.2604,0.0583,3.9502,0.3268,1.1472,5.047,3.1433,0.54,2.2751,4.841,4.1786,3.5305,0.827,2.3981,0.7482,1.514,2.1584,4.0959,5.361,1.8115,1.3923,1.9303,5.0077,2.9565,1.1206,1.54,6.1968,0.6343,1.061,1.3873,6.3357,1.222,0.6484,6.6512,1.3006,0.0012,3.591,2.3369,2.7505,2.7509,1.1952,3.0601,1.4965,2.6757,4.0319,2.5315,0.5692]}

We now are looking at a massive, massive humanitarian situation on Manus Island, and it requires us all to act together. The crisis has gotten so bad that we cannot keep the situation on Manus Island the way it is. The Compact of Amity and Cooperation is not a legal instrument in PNG, not an agreement under international law, and it is not in keeping with international standards on human rights. Some of the people who are arriving on Manus Island, including children, have absolutely no access to medical treatment. They have no right to be able to talk to NGOs and to ask for assistance at some stage.\nIn light of the compacts and agreements that Papua New Guinea has signed with Australia, where is the responsibility that you take to ensure that people in your care are taken care of, not only health-wise and safety-wise, but also in terms of respect for human rights.\nUNHCR PNG Chief Administrative Officer Gary Lewis said the agency was deeply concerned about the way the Compact of Amity and Cooperation that allows the PNG Government to return deportees to Australia was not applied equally to all people who arrived on Manus Island.\nAsylum-seekers fleeing violence and climate change in war-torn Yemen came to a small port on Thursday in the Middle East state of Qatar with only two days still on their six-month visa.\nThe refugees arrived in the country of a sizeable expatriate community from Yemen after having lived for several months in a makeshift shelter on the Arabian Gulf.\nThe migrants, all of whom fled fighting, hunger and disease in the southern nation, left Yemen on April 27 after Qatar agreed to shelter them.\nQatari authorities asked them to make the last journeys on a chartered bus on Thursday.

One facility has a separate office for each inmate, with no personal contact between inmates on the floor.\nAt some prisons, there have even been cuts in the basic necessities \u2014 such as clothes for prisoners \u2014 and a loss of mental healthcare.\nIn one facility on the West Coast, an administrator said, staff who had worked in a previous facility for decades were required to move to another maximum-security facility on the East Coast after the Trump administration changed its \u201cpolicy on the front line.\u201d\nOn the New Jersey prison where I work, the administration has ordered us to be more vigilant and less compassionate, said a former inmate who was transferred to this prison in 2017 following previous allegations of abuse and neglect at another prison in New Jersey.\nHe said that the administration has also reduced food served to prisoners, although he said the prison will still continue to provide food to them in spite of the cutbacks.\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t having it, but they\u2019re going to feed us,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m told there is no money to provide it when there is a budget.\nThe administration\u2019s changes came as a new wave of protests erupted across the country in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis.\nThe protests quickly spread to New York after Floyd\u2019s death. Some of the protesters \u2014 in most cases, mostly black and white college graduates \u2014 took to the streets in New York with the hope of creating a safe space for their fellow black and brown New Yorkers. They demanded \u201cjustice\u201d for Floyd and the many African Americans killed by police officers.\nDuring a visit to one of the NYPD schools Friday, Trump said he expects to see \u201ca lot of violence\u201d from young New Yorkers.\nIt\u2019s my responsibility to do my part, said a White House official, but those who took to the streets Saturday were more concerned about the safety of New Yorkers than were the protesters Friday.","token_len":516,"entropy":[8.465,2.2876,1.3967,1.2964,0.029,1.2356,2.284,6.0262,6.0926,6.8309,0.313,12.2994,4.1394,2.2881,5.0319,4.385,1.2524,8.1606,0.0037,4.0786,0.5573,7.6316,0.0403,0.0049,4.5874,3.725,2.884,4.6463,0.8789,1.0233,5.9948,3.7848,1.3709,3.1839,2.1354,2.3296,4.0485,2.8917,2.7023,1.0683,0.4941,1.7932,0.3187,17.4246,2.3376,0.0013,3.0684,2.4724,0.0755,1.0141,2.6423,0.1114,1.3618,3.6841,3.5344,1.9761,4.5375,5.8756,0.0633,3.4765,1.914,8.403,2.3682,0.0004,6.4337,1.7049,3.8821,0.0011,5.1944,0.2274,9.5048,3.8847,3.781,3.5065,0.0695,1.545,0.5188,2.398,5.9983,0.0005,1.6127,1.4159,3.9826,9.0954,0.1331,6.4287,0.4133,0.0017,1.4609,1.3216,0.0794,6.978,8.8836,0.0962,0.0049,2.696,0.4256,6.1396,8.5853,2.0436,0.1197,6.2093,0.0741,0.8781,2.3391,3.8901,2.4246,3.9433,4.1694,5.1628,5.0548,1.5904,4.237,1.3653,1.0624,3.6207,3.0304,7.5294,1.929,1.738,1.5238,5.892,0.6351,5.2364,1.7741,0.5211,3.7361,4.4848,2.848,0.3685,3.7527,2.3341,3.436,0.0044,6.0701,1.3434,1.7303,7.7043,5.0171,4.6554,2.9725,0.0012,4.9766,2.959,2.3395,1.769,3.3112,3.5111,6.9943,0.0516,5.3071,5.694,1.8954,0.5957,1.9972,2.4595,3.7925,4.7441,1.281,2.2856,1.4565,0.1494,3.7981,5.1335,1.8545,2.5687,3.2473,5.485,2.3693,3.114,2.1139,2.4385,3.6927,1.4574,2.7926,3.772,1.2882,5.5517,0.05,4.0311,2.5939,1.8786,7.3698,0.205,0.0013,0.447,4.5373,0.6634,2.9473,0.0071,3.6945,1.7758,1.9458,0.0617,5.1094,1.0587,16.0064,8.1006,3.5937,2.7657,2.3155,8.2794,4.0224,1.2465,11.17,6.4364,0.3464,4.5664,1.2747,5.9801,1.1963,3.8845,3.3782,4.2375,1.8057,0.1894,2.1347,2.6517,1.4082,3.9177,6.5001,0.1451,4.8944,2.9827,4.0155,2.6673,3.0477,6.5666,1.8341,3.262,3.1719,2.2217,1.3732,1.0075,2.7555,2.8524,0.8179,4.8254,1.9735,1.5,4.283,6.7347,6.9304,5.6376,0.6328,1.4216,2.3281,0.5995,3.3621,4.2301,2.8589,2.0364,1.9146,0.214,0.1956,0.4693,4.7355,0.6625,1.8449,2.4862,2.0672,1.8001,2.2817,4.3472,5.0523,10.0487,1.7236,1.9009,2.1419,5.191,1.1338,1.3586,1.9659,4.4444,4.9421,2.4507,4.1431,0.4047,1.9532,1.7096,1.0078,4.773,3.7508,5.7789,0.0049,0.7789,4.0467,0.9194,0.2196,0.259,4.5701,3.8788,9.3849,5.938,9.3489,11.9517,0.2558,5.556,2.2459,2.2828,3.5736,1.0424,4.6316,1.2992,2.1175,2.7946,0.1444,4.5512,2.5113,1.779,3.7506,3.2256,1.1539,0.3651,0.1394,4.1348,0.7354,2.6629,3.2066,2.7335,0.7142,5.8347,5.0354,1.4014,0.9486,4.393,1.6205,4.6163,3.3924,6.1899,3.1492,0.7547,2.3774,3.1913,3.1859,2.3842,2.3359,2.8387,7.3481,2.3284,0.5251,5.3268,4.6705,1.7938,2.1445,5.7153,4.3298,0.0029,4.4178,1.8219,2.6581,0.1861,0.3521,1.9449,1.9551,2.3094,0.0017,0.5079,4.4314,0.1012,6.9585,18.9905,1.1601,0.6469,3.0711,0.476,3.7353,5.2726,2.0421,1.4208,2.3132,1.8365,5.5865,1.5899,0.4713,2.9723,0.265,5.6179,3.1,6.5054,0.8193,0.5632,0.2711,1.7191,3.9139,2.3905,0.5387,1.3555,6.4598,5.3301,6.2818,0.1944,2.6542,4.4612,2.4552,2.7398,2.8273,8.985,4.0992,0.4875,3.0833,0.2213,0.304,0.0567,1.6137,2.4434,0.101,5.6978,3.53,4.484,0.5479,5.2613,0.4392,5.4498,0.4508,0.3221,2.4921,2.5567,3.4191,2.4939,0.5459,5.6524,0.0639,0.7309,4.1592,4.8321,9.8833,1.0284,6.7163,0.9347,5.4109,2.8773,1.0366,2.1419,2.3133,4.5242,4.8687,1.1499,3.4356,0.8247,0.7329,3.2908,1.1929,0.3187,4.873,1.6611,2.65,0.1907,3.6356,0.2301,0.444,7.4301,8.3974,7.4496,0.4259,4.687,2.0465,1.8488,6.1738,1.4837,1.6018,6.0019,0.187,2.4147,0.9467,0.892,4.975,5.051,2.1033,2.3635,4.5396,7.2853,0.1136,1.0933,0.5801,5.1617,2.7453,1.7395,0.0209,6.6641,3.509,0.3846,3.5425,1.7993,0.5802,1.7234,4.422,2.4081,5.7104,0.019,0.361,1.6022,3.3465,5.888,1.4805,5.7918,1.3899,0.0726,0.0139,5.2113,1.6832,4.6778,0.938,0.4397,1.5134,1.6799,0.1141,3.8866,0.4612,1.0733,7.1562,1.1889,2.3996,9.0241,0.4285]}

But he said the expansion was \"not a new plan.\" Moscow already plans to expand its foreign military deployments from its current 34 base sites to 42 by the end of next year, Mr Peskov said, citing an agreement to construct two new bases in Djibouti and one in Eritrea. Those bases are to provide the Russian military with access to the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden. The expansion of the Russian military has received much criticism, in particular in the West, where governments accuse Moscow of trying to undermine national security in its old and new competitors by providing weapons and military advice. In South Asia, where Russia is the main regional weapons exporter and an important arms importer, there are concerns that it may be increasing its military role by building up and deploying troops outside Russia's traditional areas. But Russia recently began sending new troops to some of its most important military bases, including the Kurils archipelago in Japan and the Kaliningrad peninsula on the Baltic Sea. Russia has also increased its military presence in Africa, deploying tanks from the Black Sea to the Sahel. It also plans a major expansion in Latin America. In the Baltic Sea, Russia is building a new major port for its navy. It has also started to build a new nuclear submarine base near Sevastopol, the Crimea peninsula where Russia has an arsenal of nuclear warheads. The planned expansion of its overseas military deployments will follow a decision last year to extend NATO's alliance to include Russia. The move has angered Moscow and made it appear as though Russia intends to extend its military presence through the eastern and southern Baltic States.

Praljak said he had taken poison in the courtroom immediately after his execution on Wednesday as he claimed in a court papers that he and his aides had taken the drug to save lives. He also claimed to have been tortured and ill-treated during his 21-year imprisonment.\nPreliminary examination of Praljak's body found traces of cyanide, a drug that causes high blood pressure and kidney failure, said Dutch police spokesman Dirk Engels. \"They don't rule out the possibility that he took cyanide the day before the execution was expected. But they don't conclude that he ingested any.\"\nPraljak, a former commander of the Ustaso-nationalist forces accused of the worst atrocities in the conflict, was executed at the Hague by lethal injection.\nEngels said the death of Praljak was one of the highest-profile cases involving human rights abuses in recent years involving an execution by lethal injection and human rights violations within the Nato-led international campaign.\nPraljak had requested the Netherlands for a new trial in July. He had also lodged complaints that his family had been tortured in prison by Croatian paramilitary officers.\nBosnian defence attorney Ivo Simonovic said on Friday he had filed a formal appeal in the Dutch High Court that would extend his client's execution by two days.\nPraljak, 67, had died in cell isolation at the prison where he had served for much of his 21 years of a life sentence and where he had been the only prisoner to serve most of that time.\nHe also had been tortured at the prison, but had maintained he had been beaten and maltreated repeatedly by the guards during his long term in solitary confinement.\nPraljak was convicted of genocide for his role in the breakup of the Croatian nation in 1991 and had previously filed a written complaint that Croatian officials tortured his wife and three of his sons during their incarceration in 1993.\nHague chief prosecutor Signe Bronsma expressed outrage over the execution, calling it \"absolutely revolting,\" while expressing a hope for better treatment of inmates before their sentencing.\nThe Netherlands was among the leading Nato allies in the campaign against the former Yugoslavia which ended in the collapse of the communist regime in Yugoslavia in the mid-1990s after an armed struggle saw the emergence of separatist movements such as Croatan Praljak's, seeking independence.","token_len":517,"entropy":[10.4389,6.1585,5.2605,0.4861,9.4966,1.8268,3.7821,4.2606,2.6725,7.3334,7.0428,0.1601,0.0048,6.7728,5.8435,0.1479,2.8273,3.2692,1.1685,5.1398,0.1574,0.056,2.0157,9.577,2.2251,0.7853,1.2475,1.9135,0.1968,3.9271,0.0004,0.0026,0.0018,7.1844,0.6861,1.5724,4.2348,3.8927,2.7763,1.7471,6.8037,8.0527,0.356,1.4259,3.0512,3.5855,3.6708,5.2179,1.0358,5.7135,5.1072,0.9828,2.7461,5.1334,0.337,0.4991,5.0533,0.738,5.9963,0.7745,3.9108,2.5434,4.5795,2.2572,5.4082,4.2737,0.3368,3.1688,2.9133,1.8921,2.4975,0.1081,2.1687,3.4809,2.202,6.1986,0.237,0.1719,3.1594,0.9541,8.3333,0.4958,1.0928,2.2805,0.5224,1.1386,16.6185,8.9327,0.0531,4.5084,0.8057,3.5462,0.0012,0.002,0.0028,0.1344,1.1676,1.7209,2.8317,0.0072,0.5627,0.0041,1.5882,2.0447,4.2244,1.5931,2.8633,5.3809,0.6125,0.2833,0.9837,5.2063,0.7231,0.8789,4.2473,3.0849,4.1714,1.8687,4.3231,10.0219,0.4282,2.8678,4.9105,4.553,0.0008,6.4848,0.1206,1.5212,0.0624,0.5747,1.1507,3.5864,1.7343,0.0037,6.6529,1.491,1.3031,2.1574,1.414,4.7482,6.3806,2.7577,2.3048,2.391,2.3164,0.0004,8.5383,0.445,0.6898,5.3221,2.8682,4.4319,0.5898,0.8375,0.0518,0.0023,0.0022,1.6004,1.9088,1.6811,5.2367,0.2722,0.5729,4.6411,4.0149,2.5263,6.5924,3.69,7.2456,1.4437,5.6636,6.894,0.0848,3.3493,4.0527,1.1544,1.3587,1.1505,4.1291,0.3913,0.8178,2.7133,2.9711,1.617,4.029,3.9255,4.7603,0.0113,2.3123,1.6488,11.4716,0.0557,0.3405,1.267,2.6902,2.6094,0.774,0.0003,0.0014,0.002,1.1256,4.9034,0.0867,0.7497,4.7271,1.5037,0.0639,3.1104,4.0217,4.0234,0.1072,1.3492,1.1713,3.5398,0.8462,5.5178,5.3716,3.6251,3.1366,0.4972,0.0093,3.6455,4.733,0.1514,1.118,6.0255,0.7254,7.0531,1.334,0.5508,3.669,5.5953,2.8271,0.7243,1.2072,0.0356,0.0023,0.002,2.5178,6.8593,2.0246,5.0834,4.1121,1.4061,3.5815,0.7574,2.2731,4.6397,2.8356,2.1302,1.5481,2.6352,6.4618,4.6721,3.5891,2.0882,3.6423,1.0773,0.4375,3.4378,2.3206,3.7174,3.2768,3.9878,5.2371,4.1609,1.2004,0.8178,5.2022,0.0675,0.1676,9.1805,3.4298,5.1362,1.6836,8.2796,0.4755,0.5464,2.5797,0.5043,2.8714,1.5059,3.2487,0.6592,2.3909,1.509,3.5332,0.4181,1.8403,2.3677,0.0153,4.9897,1.7548,5.6526,1.569,4.8678,0.0152,5.1058,3.4801,2.6423,3.9985,0.4527,0.9732,1.4935,0.0818,0.0021,0.0024,1.8458,5.8738,0.0058,1.3174,5.653,1.7001,8.6901,8.3256,1.4604,0.6768,3.49,2.4372,0.2618,0.9503,3.3767,4.6858,6.5068,0.0012,0.4347,4.467,1.2109,3.2745,5.5958,1.8148,0.0517,3.9717,3.5194,0.6222,0.6989,0.9067,4.6327,3.5527,3.0277,1.1542,4.7328,5.4648,0.0334,4.0239,0.2383,0.6373,1.0687,2.2153,4.8602,0.8325,0.9075,3.8287,3.2065,0.8244,1.846,1.8437,3.9062,2.413,5.8109,2.1046,1.0028,1.8029,4.9539,1.3653,7.5813,0.0002,6.2421,1.6352,2.3351,3.0776,3.4554,0.3742,4.9068,4.0968,3.091,4.2234,0.0174,0.4608,0.6127,1.3328,0.0175,0.0016,0.0022,2.0481,2.8933,0.8572,3.4328,3.9176,1.8218,0.6706,0.026,0.4557,8.2337,0.0279,1.9751,2.9991,3.5734,1.9563,1.8262,1.5174,4.0764,4.3816,6.4562,0.5471,5.9858,1.9181,3.8019,7.1698,2.47,5.8789,2.9184,2.6075,0.9071,3.0309,2.775,0.489,2.5805,3.485,1.6051,3.7876,1.2834,4.1906,0.223,0.731,6.815,3.8162,5.8697,0.5306,10.924,2.9234,5.9101,5.3683,4.9578,5.4916,3.4427,2.0051,0.455,3.0713,1.6136,2.2174,0.6434,0.7994,5.1935,6.1371,0.0002,4.4489,3.4718,5.755,4.0999,3.6598,2.3949,5.3871,1.6432,0.8447,5.6276,5.0385,2.7288,5.6816,0.5607,0.5196,2.3659,2.8412,3.3863,2.561,1.172,5.4761,4.9725,2.3945,1.5,1.5902,2.7613,0.9985,1.3131,4.1379,0.5512,5.2637,3.1299,0.2496,3.1809,4.0301,0.0723,0.6822,2.1472,2.6848,0.5288,4.766,0.394,4.2703,3.4135,0.0489,0.1346,0.0017,3.8269,4.1208,2.6479,3.1996,8.0914,1.4125,6.7096,0.0097,6.4596,2.3281,5.1826,0.001,7.0827,6.1064,7.0256,3.7832,0.0646,0.0317,3.1559,3.6358,7.4231,2.3643,2.0087]}

We are still open to working with the British government to address some of the concerns that were raised and resolved.\n\"We are, of course, willing to accommodate, but there is no guarantee that we will get there or that it will be acceptable to all sides.\"\nBritain's Brexit secretary David Davis has told MPs that a deal is now at hand which will satisfy Dublin.\nHe announced his resignation as a Conservative MP on Friday following widespread pressure over the Brexit negotiations.\nIt means Mr Varadkar's government will need to agree with the opposition Fine Gael party that any withdrawal agreement should include a mechanism to prevent a cross-border hard border.\nHe added that \"the United Kingdom wants to protect the integrity of the Irish Sea fishery\" and that Brexit leaders could agree in principle to put forward a \"significant package\" on how fisheries in the Northern Sea Route between Britain's Isle of Man and Ireland's Grand Island in the Irish Sea would be organised once Britain is no longer part of the EU.\nMr Davis had earlier said that the deal will avoid hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and would give Britain control of the Irish Sea border.\nAsked when he would announce the details of a Brexit deal after having been in talks with Mr Johnson and his team for three days, Mr Davis said: \"We will make that announcement at the time that we have a package put together and if the Irish Government and a parliamentary majority support then that should happen on Sunday.\"\nHowever, Mr Davis, who said he wanted a deal to be achieved by Sunday, added that he has not seen the agreement and its details which is due to be presented to Brussels.\nIt had been widely assumed by the public that a deal would be announced on Saturday morning but it was not immediately clear what would happen.","token_len":518,"entropy":[8.5859,5.3221,2.0664,9.5691,3.112,7.3772,1.5544,2.4105,9.8256,4.6437,1.1699,4.0257,4.6395,0.1479,0.2622,3.8241,0.1359,2.2768,0.5685,3.3671,0.8154,0.559,6.2181,1.546,0.0394,0.2076,1.6185,0.0066,1.4249,8.1186,3.7203,0.1813,5.3544,0.0019,0.0,0.0,2.4607,2.1965,4.3325,0.4378,2.9789,0.928,4.0426,0.0771,0.1458,21.6605,0.0,0.0002,7.9968,3.1328,4.7757,2.1641,0.0105,1.1928,0.8322,5.996,2.3282,6.4556,1.3539,4.6188,5.9445,7.9507,3.7856,8.5538,0.0692,2.7441,3.1772,2.9567,0.213,2.6369,3.5269,0.0121,0.0284,0.3291,1.994,0.5779,0.0012,1.0087,1.4574,2.899,3.08,0.0029,3.4848,3.737,1.7301,2.7806,3.0338,2.0447,0.9612,4.178,0.2503,0.1345,7.2045,1.9063,0.7595,3.0991,1.9863,0.2351,2.4099,0.9906,9.6407,1.5239,2.4762,5.9277,4.312,0.6802,4.7354,2.0313,1.4421,3.4854,6.3862,3.9102,5.1143,3.035,0.3992,0.2825,2.2215,0.3115,4.3701,0.9165,0.1413,2.3374,2.5413,1.1447,1.1325,3.8529,4.5256,3.7911,4.2382,0.0073,7.2115,0.6948,1.2539,1.2955,0.0,0.0004,0.0,0.091,0.6133,2.1081,1.4111,0.0291,1.4749,0.5678,2.5273,2.1862,0.4105,0.6113,1.574,2.2803,6.5233,3.6272,3.8755,4.7473,2.3668,2.0586,2.0181,3.4858,4.8878,0.3055,5.0927,0.8407,0.8506,4.1446,0.6993,1.8599,5.7693,3.3873,0.1833,0.7443,1.7187,1.4434,2.8241,0.1682,3.2121,7.2883,2.6003,1.2556,0.2072,1.5193,1.3728,5.5867,1.5228,0.0015,0.0172,5.2459,0.0474,5.875,4.2514,0.7062,2.2764,0.7388,0.9739,0.5399,0.8709,1.4912,0.3691,3.1942,1.9076,4.8027,1.1575,3.1358,0.1408,0.6459,4.4495,0.6974,2.9014,2.6158,0.8836,0.072,4.7682,1.3885,3.9469,1.8484,3.0117,0.0009,2.8066,3.4126,3.9684,0.8982,3.29,2.5799,2.7688,2.9138,5.2518,0.7523,3.4277,1.1964,6.9211,3.7365,2.3455,0.3077,2.1153,7.0987,3.7009,2.8666,2.176,3.229,5.0301,1.4443,1.0738,1.013,3.8895,5.583,4.9012,2.7968,1.1084,2.6195,2.2358,0.5897,0.2601,4.5478,5.2984,3.1067,1.2205,0.0003,0.0024,2.1176,2.3635,1.1812,3.6393,0.3498,2.4744,2.9585,0.998,5.606,6.2031,0.0,3.2762,1.8565,3.9765,6.2791,3.9823,2.3598,2.7503,0.9653,6.1393,0.9907,3.1218,2.0131,6.6846,0.096,0.111,5.0075,0.0994,0.7553,0.1611,3.2504,3.0108,0.667,3.1566,1.9535,5.6173,0.0253,5.2362,0.5963,5.1184,1.3583,3.6367,0.1545,0.6487,1.7574,6.8865,10.0042,0.0056,2.7205,0.5282,1.4275,4.6284,6.3409,3.771,2.6253,4.8363,0.5043,0.8181,5.3006,3.0431,0.783,2.233,4.8709,3.2176,0.8396,3.5524,2.2874,8.596,3.0365,0.4077,4.1014,6.7229,13.601,5.0278,2.8677,3.4533,5.6015,0.0045,0.0022,0.0847,1.2087,2.5736,9.5534,5.5897,4.8917,0.3459,3.594,0.0791,1.88,0.0654,8.2621,5.4915,1.7761,4.9976,3.892,0.0186,1.7782,0.0073,0.0327,0.7351,0.1295,0.1142,2.3543,1.9402,4.1309,2.5617,1.1681,0.7697,1.7492,3.2816,4.3904,5.752,3.8798,0.1339,4.1883,1.4249,0.0181,0.0367,1.6844,2.0758,2.0888,3.8484,2.8315,4.0098,0.8257,0.5967,1.8499,0.0902,6.8381,1.2899,0.2723,4.4026,5.0591,0.9709,0.4543,3.647,1.6082,2.3685,0.084,2.1223,3.6138,0.2016,4.6078,5.8789,2.516,2.5751,1.4361,0.2883,1.9325,5.6401,2.4264,2.564,2.2172,3.527,2.9245,0.8323,0.3639,0.4822,0.6542,0.3849,0.7464,0.012,2.1522,1.2757,2.7803,2.565,1.1177,2.6367,0.5983,4.2324,2.5609,1.1479,0.8317,3.0438,6.5892,7.3266,2.2193,2.5974,5.1758,2.6287,3.9738,4.1619,3.3,5.9893,5.372,1.2654,3.8844,8.0244,1.3833,4.5392,2.8152,3.5768,3.491,1.098,0.1996,3.9489,0.2123,2.1827,1.0583,4.0344,0.4161,3.7789,0.8236,3.3658,2.0474,1.22,1.9552,0.9095,4.5486,1.5803,2.8653,0.7711,3.2222,0.6261,1.5719,4.6709,1.7004,3.3328,1.4456,3.015,2.3527,6.7678,1.7621,6.2752,4.6017,3.3054,0.2853,0.1755,2.7862,0.2632,6.0079,2.9508,0.24,4.3405,5.2375,0.5887,3.6177,4.215,2.3588,1.817,4.0884,0.4736,2.3243,1.2799,0.881,0.8198,3.4848,1.4295,2.4698,2.2502,1.9368,2.3149,1.0303,1.7423,2.4169,0.2548,2.513,2.9509,0.7051,2.4099]}
{"prompt":"Disagreement among U.S. congressional Republicans is already swirling around a tax cut plan unveiled days ago by President Donald Trump , who has proposed repealing the tax on inheritances and eliminating a deduction for state","text":"Disagreement among U.S. congressional Republicans is already swirling around a tax cut plan unveiled days ago by President Donald Trump, who has proposed repealing the tax on inheritances and eliminating a deduction for state and local taxes.\nRepublicans in Congress are concerned there will be no impact on taxes for most Americans. Democratic leaders have raised concerns that the proposed tax reforms will weaken support for a spending deal for the government\u2019s upcoming legislative budget. Congress will meet on Wednesday and Thursday in a closed session to hammer out a deal on budget matters.\nThe tax cuts Trump proposed are designed to attract private investment and create job opportunities while bolstering a weak American economy.\nThe U.S. is going into its most tumultuous election since World War II and President Trump is riding a wave of support, which is encouraging even moderate Democratic lawmakers.\nSenate Democrat Joe Manchin from West Virginia said in an interview with CNN on Sunday that he is \u201cvery comfortable\u201d supporting such a tax cut and that no Democrats wanted to be seen as too harsh on Trump\u2019s proposed plan. Democrats, and some moderate Republicans, want a tax cut to be more targeted to low-income Americans, but Republicans and some tax experts believe the existing corporate tax cuts could support many middle-income Americans who are currently paying high taxes on income earned from employment.\nManchin said Democrats have the necessary majority in the Senate to pass tax reform legislation, but he doesn\u2019t want to \u201cimpose any tax on anybody.\u201d\nThe White House has also announced a 10-cent tax cut for every person who spends at least $1,000 annually on Medicare Prescription Drug Plans, the Trump administration said in a press release. This proposal is designed to encourage people to enroll in the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, which many older Americans cannot afford or aren\u2019t eligible for because they don\u2019t work for a company with a health insurance plan.\nA U.S. government proposal, released earlier this month, estimated that a 10-cent Medicare drug deduction would result in a net savings of $6 billion over a decade and $9 billion over a lifetime. The government\u2019s plan, which included a tax exemption for people who donated an eye, a kidney or a liver, predicted that savings would be $7.5 billion over a decade and $11 billion over a lifetime.\nTrump\u2019s supporters have accused House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise of being too conservative, but the congressmen have dismissed those accusations.","token_len":518,"entropy":[6.329,1.7581,5.875,5.1536,0.0533,0.0059,0.0715,7.0498,2.8092,2.9167,5.4376,8.0757,1.9099,2.081,6.1334,2.4653,3.1941,5.0426,7.8368,1.8201,1.3299,1.7633,0.8783,0.0078,1.8826,1.8612,1.2929,3.9347,4.6233,1.0944,3.5195,1.8261,7.3913,0.0146,2.0277,5.3232,3.3622,3.805,0.0908,1.5458,0.0701,0.0193,0.5584,0.5704,0.3965,25.4144,1.7491,0.4872,1.2352,4.8975,6.2253,1.939,0.0482,1.5468,5.954,0.2408,6.4379,1.483,3.9377,0.7675,1.5454,6.9854,1.2459,2.0051,4.9903,1.12,1.0496,1.4234,3.4357,1.1655,5.8968,1.4087,5.7071,5.2498,0.1318,2.2058,6.7557,3.3031,4.6543,0.916,1.8258,16.6685,8.3356,6.1412,7.3855,7.2667,7.3844,0.7319,7.0162,2.7201,3.6455,1.3663,2.0013,2.8082,1.3348,2.9972,2.1111,1.1858,1.011,0.9889,4.7241,0.0222,0.9361,1.8456,2.1083,5.3358,3.8194,0.3904,0.2555,7.7501,2.6644,1.7483,4.7446,2.8302,2.7893,3.5466,0.0505,5.8689,4.3388,1.7898,1.1131,3.4735,4.2785,1.9749,3.9125,5.2943,0.0013,4.3307,4.3619,5.3392,0.2315,0.2683,1.1799,1.8394,4.6828,0.0004,0.0025,0.0035,2.9523,6.5496,3.5367,3.2644,4.1738,3.1826,3.4372,1.312,1.438,0.0008,0.0734,2.2075,3.9971,1.2116,1.6566,8.2282,1.2366,0.1708,0.0439,3.3895,3.8435,3.2768,1.948,5.0055,4.7424,5.4187,5.1205,1.0135,1.5363,0.58,5.0595,6.5589,5.0369,0.1148,0.0,5.6597,0.0137,0.0015,1.5207,2.7349,1.5199,0.0639,1.5602,2.2625,2.1094,3.0978,0.2379,1.1337,2.0997,14.3079,5.6789,2.6852,6.1136,1.9276,6.5171,3.4923,4.9383,0.3814,1.3292,0.5261,3.1888,1.6343,6.2869,3.9688,6.1185,0.4902,3.3913,1.9634,0.6054,4.5004,4.4752,0.4918,2.3897,3.7884,0.3295,0.052,4.0524,2.7333,0.1937,6.7769,3.194,6.1771,1.4869,4.3817,0.2624,0.3238,3.5928,2.1422,1.9318,0.3464,2.021,2.6946,2.8407,4.9912,2.6809,2.7759,0.1353,0.5855,1.1462,1.7462,2.3466,4.1202,3.1998,1.2275,6.2639,1.0515,3.0466,1.6574,7.4936,5.1305,0.361,2.2571,2.5271,7.5624,4.2992,1.4029,0.3398,2.1148,1.3791,2.526,2.0666,4.6899,2.11,3.9205,0.9512,2.1246,3.1895,3.6847,4.1162,6.0833,0.7526,0.1227,5.3596,0.0311,0.0022,0.6816,3.817,2.589,3.9622,6.1839,3.9855,1.0637,0.7702,0.5904,0.2174,0.9878,2.867,0.6329,2.3748,1.807,0.9799,2.0535,3.8954,4.3924,2.2914,0.0556,2.2754,0.4681,13.3646,0.0863,4.5771,0.2879,2.0442,2.5313,2.0529,6.2528,0.9712,5.3742,6.4858,0.3741,2.5629,3.2307,0.0005,1.3702,2.8716,4.7357,1.937,5.5978,1.0517,4.5464,1.305,0.5003,0.7399,4.9388,4.3599,2.0182,6.0313,2.0318,0.0007,0.1704,2.0491,0.6581,0.2483,2.5304,1.383,6.8958,12.3249,0.0558,0.1373,3.3084,1.2348,3.2967,5.3521,0.3754,1.3097,2.0476,0.2084,3.1032,0.3077,0.9504,4.2192,5.0301,1.8407,3.1643,0.03,3.6383,1.8709,0.3599,3.7055,0.1741,3.1852,2.1212,1.8477,0.0035,0.1593,0.4108,1.0919,0.7531,5.8244,5.8814,0.5066,4.2084,0.0554,4.0151,4.8663,0.8318,0.4402,0.0227,1.9398,0.1362,3.4001,1.7922,2.269,0.1122,0.0448,0.0867,3.7632,3.2735,2.2814,3.5018,3.913,0.9989,4.1899,1.2834,0.4269,0.3839,0.3904,4.1946,5.1769,0.0005,0.0048,0.0051,4.6337,6.3998,4.7038,3.3981,3.089,0.1916,0.6475,0.2937,5.178,0.4163,3.1144,2.0702,0.6272,0.0151,4.3428,5.8833,7.8808,0.6044,4.1863,0.0016,1.5375,3.0685,1.9307,0.0519,0.2873,3.5676,1.3201,0.8701,2.8114,0.5995,2.9387,2.3653,3.3456,0.48,0.6029,1.6816,3.5523,0.6921,2.0386,3.5544,8.5074,0.1369,0.0188,2.0053,2.725,1.1772,5.3878,1.0449,3.3021,6.0521,0.305,3.0187,1.1736,7.5366,5.0387,6.8498,1.7854,3.2963,4.6877,0.9638,1.4236,2.779,1.259,8.6198,0.9434,4.1198,0.7309,0.7621,1.9599,3.4964,1.1412,1.3256,0.0482,0.6073,0.5457,0.4705,1.2433,0.1599,2.3069,0.5309,0.0693,0.0339,0.0324,0.237,0.3364,3.6933,3.3298,0.0237,0.0382,9.5584,1.6693,3.9336,4.3498,3.5014,0.0328,7.8412,0.0024,3.8912,3.4995,0.3598,3.2901,0.0028,0.0,0.1888,1.078,1.63,2.5659,2.0427,2.6804,2.275,8.22,1.0283,1.6866,5.9261,2.0427,1.5312,1.043]}

Reuters has not edited the statements","text":"The following statements were posted to the verified Twitter accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, @ realDonaldTrump and @ POTUS. The opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements.\nThe comments came a day after Twitter banned Donald Trump on his official account after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said he was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with his use of the social media platform for months despite the president\u2019s use of Twitter to promote and spread false and conspiracy theories.\nHe said \u201cthis is the biggest problem with the platform right now. It\u2019s like Twitter and Facebook are in business to block conservative news \u2026 They just don\u2019t like the facts.\u201d\nThe Washington Post reported that the ban was lifted last week with Dorsey later thanking Trump for speaking up.\nHowever he claimed Trump threatened to shut down the Trump Tower and demanded to know who he was speaking with after he spoke to reporters on Saturday about the Twitter ban.\n\u201cWe get it, he [Trump]\u2019s got a big mouth,\u201d Dorsey said, adding that Twitter \u201csupports the free expression of speech.\u201d\nThe statement by Dorsey said, \u201cWhen President Trump tweeted that a reporter at the New York Post who wrote a book about his finances \u2018deserved to be fired,\u2019\u201d Twitter told the president it would remove the tweet from view in its feed.\n\u201cHis tweet came in violation of Twitter\u2019s Community Standards, which prohibits the use of Twitter for political purposes,\u201d he said.\nTwitter also suspended Trump\u2019s account for a period of 12 hours this morning, but the account has since been restored.\n\u201cThe suspension was lifted and the administration is continuing to have access to the site,\u201d Trump\u2019s Twitter team said.\nTwitter has been under fire at home and abroad for its handling of the president\u2019s account, where he has been posting misleading comments and disingenuously accusing President Joe Biden of fraud.\nTrump told the rally in Florida that Joe Biden was using stolen votes from Georgia \u2013 a disputed recount state \u2013 to win the

Guaido said the government tried to force opposition lawmakers not present to sign an agreement.\nThe government has proposed the establishment of a transitional council to guide a peaceful end to Maduro\u2019s presidency, free of ties to the leftist movement that has ruled Venezuela for decades. On Friday, Guaido rejected the proposal arguing that the establishment of such a group would put the country at risk of military intervention.\nOn Saturday, Maduro, who has been in power for 13 years and is contesting his second term after being sworn in again at an electoral poll last month, accused Guaido of preparing a coup.\nVenezuela\u2019s Supreme Court dissolved the opposition Congress on Wednesday, accusing it of ignoring orders of lawmakers not to recognize Maduro\u2019s new government. Maduro said on Sunday that the court had no jurisdiction to dismiss it over its failure to accept the results of the December 6 elections, which he said had been rigged to keep his party in power.\nGuaido denounced the crackdown on those who had protested in support of the opposition, which he said had left at least two people dead. On a separate tweet, he declared on Twitter that he was acting as head of a military committee under the guise of the transitional council.","token_len":518,"entropy":[12.2028,0.1386,9.6698,5.7186,3.238,4.6826,2.8046,4.9137,4.0645,0.8974,4.7043,2.44,0.0091,2.0095,1.9231,4.3485,4.8505,5.0071,6.5194,3.453,0.021,0.8005,0.9562,0.1505,1.8065,4.7494,2.9252,6.8008,4.4722,4.003,0.1421,0.2173,2.2247,0.5946,5.1751,3.6862,0.9659,0.2175,0.2296,13.7507,2.9338,2.583,0.1752,0.9862,5.0623,0.4253,6.8139,3.1826,2.0324,0.0005,2.5303,1.8175,4.7731,2.1947,1.0609,3.1735,0.9594,0.4778,1.8568,7.1939,3.7476,1.8483,2.3054,1.7554,5.6554,6.2541,3.6821,3.8722,7.2249,5.8314,0.6579,1.8682,3.1277,2.3329,5.8933,4.5822,21.177,0.3954,5.5835,5.1894,6.4583,0.8697,0.1977,1.506,6.3486,1.4741,4.3614,3.2253,1.6858,1.4722,17.1912,7.4487,1.9043,6.2693,4.4522,0.0638,3.3914,0.9114,4.8757,2.3491,3.5632,4.3514,0.114,2.8919,4.2983,3.4738,3.2084,2.7187,2.4994,1.1778,2.1309,0.0731,0.0121,5.1748,0.213,2.7279,3.2399,1.133,2.6691,8.1768,1.8242,4.8578,3.0005,1.3491,0.0293,7.2674,0.7128,0.2181,0.1553,5.8128,5.4597,3.5817,1.2809,2.15,8.1356,5.754,3.2996,5.6659,2.997,0.0449,2.9593,0.6288,1.2224,7.093,2.1765,3.5432,7.9354,0.3679,0.6891,2.1605,0.1619,1.8456,7.3533,6.7897,6.7345,0.0766,1.4242,1.7215,0.5565,6.1781,1.4898,2.4549,4.0169,2.3038,1.87,5.8159,0.082,0.1522,4.932,2.4202,3.0584,0.1852,5.6194,0.0038,2.1298,2.7261,5.3645,5.1987,0.4046,0.0323,2.6044,5.7454,0.0441,3.8224,7.1005,0.0149,1.4066,5.5634,4.1846,1.9442,0.0029,4.842,0.6057,2.7383,1.4934,0.7677,1.9025,0.1246,1.7184,1.5793,4.7064,0.1294,2.715,1.8382,2.0383,0.2235,2.6062,3.9605,1.15,5.1182,0.0554,8.1793,0.5586,1.2574,2.9896,0.1394,3.7789,5.2862,1.922,1.3954,5.2445,0.1493,2.4063,5.4825,1.055,0.8787,1.3231,1.7436,0.342,0.7562,0.1631,1.6951,2.7357,1.0029,3.2322,1.568,2.394,0.9104,3.1657,2.4309,1.5182,1.9823,0.0007,0.1185,2.0485,4.9942,1.8209,0.0344,0.0045,5.1538,0.1378,2.2406,3.1732,1.556,1.8538,5.7458,2.7525,4.8037,7.2844,3.9588,0.8921,5.7413,0.0262,2.1514,0.0337,1.5058,1.5082,0.4743,0.5858,4.1235,0.0012,1.0003,1.5692,2.1174,6.9842,0.1078,3.7073,6.4231,1.7115,5.5035,2.552,1.4269,4.0938,1.9081,0.4995,2.8614,0.2024,1.3028,2.2546,2.2028,6.4158,4.0745,5.2046,0.0165,0.3513,4.1086,3.3683,1.2301,6.0775,3.7516,6.0841,5.3218,0.0317,4.3669,3.5188,0.0146,0.0047,3.7607,1.5192,8.2831,0.9358,7.2607,0.6669,0.8088,5.7242,4.7051,1.543,0.9129,2.7372,0.8174,1.1701,2.3531,0.2604,6.1184,2.3499,0.2043,2.9731,0.002,5.4439,1.084,1.898,7.4349,0.4387,1.2359,7.3262,0.1095,1.0214,0.0914,3.9306,0.4794,4.4208,1.5099,0.9007,1.2122,0.5525,0.6789,4.4549,1.2035,0.7213,0.1859,3.8541,2.0275,0.1202,2.4686,4.0209,0.8879,1.1481,1.8155,1.8706,0.5039,1.0599,4.7544,0.2719,1.9895,1.767,8.5593,0.0004,2.9422,2.7111,0.3496,3.8413,3.0129,3.1491,0.0649,8.1486,4.6655,4.2541,4.8454,6.3243,2.7525,1.0484,0.0418,3.5319,2.4297,0.0012,0.1906,6.9908,1.451,0.4066,1.8928,0.604,3.4934,0.0047,0.1666,2.9052,0.0117,0.0082,3.9938,0.1074,8.5868,2.268,2.6101,5.4281,1.6145,2.6644,1.3464,4.4707,1.1266,0.026,4.9846,4.8831,3.2231,6.2801,4.1462,0.1685,6.9131,2.6593,1.8345,0.0034,0.01,4.3275,1.039,0.6612,3.7809,2.2795,2.1905,1.4205,0.3656,1.1293,2.2828,1.4971,3.9917,1.3495,1.3044,5.4328,4.4618,5.65,2.5097,2.3799,0.0611,5.1498,1.2589,3.9739,0.3136,1.0588,4.3405,4.8236,2.5121,2.018,1.2171,1.8694,1.0167,1.7747,1.4436,0.7862,1.5878,4.9057,2.5476,3.684,1.2035,0.0255,0.1847,0.369,5.6824,0.0072,7.0202,0.347,7.7422,0.9789,6.0599,1.1777,3.2145,2.5971,2.417,2.6409,0.0074,1.3552,1.54,1.6342,3.3426,1.0098,0.5656,0.6369,5.4681,4.4803,0.0073,4.2465,2.3854,0.1932,1.2298,5.5622,6.1138,3.2239,7.152,0.2589,0.5571,4.8826,5.5432,3.5535,0.639,2.0736,1.5105,6.3678,1.9104,5.3784,0.0101,2.0208,4.6061,3.1362,4.8657,0.9306,5.9193,0.0145,3.2388,6.9313,0.624,0.6275]}

While LaLonde may get support from the more liberal wing of the Democratic party, support was also widespread from suburban and middle-class voters, with 49 percent of those surveyed by the New York Times telling pollsters that LaLonde will continue in the Senate this year. With a state primary vote that is not included in the national count, Sanders won the statewide contest with 30.6 percent, narrowly beaten by House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi ( D,Calif. ) who won 29.8 percent of the vote. This represents a win for Berniecrats around the country, although it will be interesting to see whether those results carry over to the primary statewide elections later this year. Sanders spent a good portion of his remarks on Southborough\u2019s working class residents, calling the victory \u201ca win for the common worker \u2026. It\u2019s a win for the working class in the suburbs of Boston. It\u2019s a win for the working families of Southborough.\u201d He was also very critical of Trump for making some statements in recent days, including a \u201cwe must not have borders\u201d line. Bernie\u2019s comments about the border were criticized by the Southborough Campaign Committee. It\u2019s interesting to see how the national campaign and the local campaign in Massachusetts will affect the Bernie base going forward. In a tweet immediately after the primary in Southborough, Trump called the primary and results \u201cvery disappointing \u2026 it\u2019s going to take more than a few days for the delegates to decide and Trump isn\u2019t going to beat Hilary Clinton in the primary.\u201d And then Trump tweeted in to the same day, \u201cIt\u2019s OK; I\u2019m not going to use this. Not tonight, if I can help it.\u201d","token_len":518,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.3359,3.3756,0.0019,8.472,2.3661,7.6836,2.2203,4.5884,0.0221,5.7046,6.5869,0.0011,0.0468,1.012,1.185,0.2436,2.0657,8.8969,1.3138,7.9213,0.3584,0.424,8.496,0.9775,2.8676,5.2844,3.8151,5.1034,5.2638,7.7166,6.7388,0.7452,4.0902,5.1245,2.7725,1.8617,4.4151,1.9094,5.0973,1.6732,6.796,2.1663,2.6232,0.7812,8.3593,1.4018,3.9405,5.793,3.7016,1.9302,0.5507,6.0871,0.6621,4.7068,0.0986,0.326,0.9213,1.1866,7.9203,0.0629,1.0976,2.5948,1.2064,0.4635,0.0823,0.1852,24.9267,0.3069,3.9932,11.4974,6.5678,5.1641,2.6236,5.5759,1.1866,6.821,2.5885,3.2758,1.362,4.6126,5.794,2.1685,1.3498,6.0645,8.7939,8.0169,5.9677,0.7684,1.17,3.0021,2.8857,5.1416,1.1633,2.2991,0.7777,0.1306,0.0363,0.0499,1.2216,4.4377,2.4352,6.0218,4.2554,0.2498,5.0753,6.7401,7.0742,1.589,1.1431,2.3864,0.7946,4.2721,3.372,1.0199,4.4507,2.0039,0.561,2.3194,0.0024,0.0009,4.4897,2.0664,0.441,0.4776,0.38,4.4235,4.8546,2.4918,6.5554,5.8366,2.1255,4.1015,7.3526,2.9903,4.4733,0.0676,0.4813,2.8668,3.2165,1.7328,2.841,9.6441,0.2444,0.5466,0.9338,2.4522,1.9778,5.0813,1.8125,0.0018,0.0027,4.3918,6.0555,5.0701,0.3877,2.1655,4.5309,1.5725,3.0235,0.0299,0.1472,0.8021,2.3058,0.2521,6.4367,5.6323,3.2196,6.0911,3.1621,5.3806,2.005,4.3319,0.1607,0.1064,1.1936,1.724,2.7561,6.1922,0.3614,0.3505,1.9117,1.8171,5.1221,1.1553,3.0783,1.3484,0.1537,5.3486,4.2478,0.1838,0.9431,2.116,0.0012,0.0058,4.1221,4.2569,5.2566,0.9153,2.7654,6.1494,0.5757,0.389,5.5721,2.4517,6.0203,4.2556,5.2747,3.8529,2.3466,4.1789,5.3707,0.1224,0.3289,3.1208,3.6449,0.2101,2.204,3.2287,1.5626,8.2728,3.3174,1.4699,5.61,0.5039,2.1583,0.0211,3.078,5.9318,6.147,0.6917,7.4458,1.5,0.0309,5.549,5.0106,0.0231,0.4197,0.8795,1.4975,0.7334,3.2997,1.0603,3.0403,1.8052,6.0243,0.2873,2.2908,0.0158,0.8428,0.0463,0.0771,0.4934,5.1109,4.7102,0.5062,3.8094,0.3227,4.0186,12.7668,0.2532,4.647,0.0436,0.1336,1.3396,5.4424,1.9073,3.5062,1.4078,4.4313,0.024,0.0406,2.7551,4.8475,3.9151,4.9687,0.1931,0.7478,0.6061,4.2675,9.5997,4.4745,3.9587,0.2162,0.3056,0.3298,3.1169,6.7409,2.6712,2.638,0.6859,0.0016,1.1025,6.1147,2.154,6.6713,0.0703,14.5686,7.8471,3.4013,8.4908,0.8423,1.5351,1.0345,4.1122,2.3682,8.4434,13.0523,6.0696,2.4394,2.9997,0.3259,1.3526,6.2295,5.3861,8.5233,3.9745,4.681,5.226,4.7702,0.4439,0.8955,0.8758,0.1715,1.2216,1.2827,0.4927,2.1219,1.9295,4.5382,1.9118,0.5533,1.3985,2.8077,0.9185,0.3021,0.0101,0.1284,0.1696,0.0692,1.0999,0.7603,4.7361,1.2767,1.8962,0.1155,1.0429,5.1451,5.9526,4.0675,3.8059,1.9311,3.778,2.3936,0.0381,6.8869,3.8051,4.2445,5.1427,3.6496,2.9931,3.6363,0.6146,1.9394,2.0508,2.731,12.5364,0.791,7.4493,3.8208,2.935,4.8894,4.9762,0.7658,3.8131,10.1662,2.5803,5.3007,5.039,2.5157,0.271,1.6756,3.2892,1.6621,4.4417,2.3182,5.4317,0.5361,2.7386,4.1783,0.0887,7.1211,0.6967,2.9307,3.9845,1.9248,0.5454,0.0309,6.0481,0.5773,0.67,1.1175,2.2362,5.7642,3.2587,4.273,1.3949,3.9565,2.3421,5.0421,3.2274,2.6839,4.5032,1.0511,6.0865,7.3733,5.6307,0.6425,0.3723,3.8007,2.4206,4.8194,7.7938,0.3606,0.3761,2.305,4.8562,0.359,0.0066,0.221,5.7331,2.6057,2.0927,3.7999,4.5554,5.502,4.8279,0.1918,3.2979,1.939,4.8849,5.9911,2.0209,0.6878,0.0357,4.9817,0.0941,3.5207,3.3181,0.5182,1.3358,1.2364,1.657,1.1333,1.1788,5.9561,0.3641,2.7518,3.9046,5.8499,5.8554,1.1559,3.9058,0.0183,1.6478,0.023,6.5836,6.1864,0.0653,0.7795,1.8881,0.9667,2.2888,0.733,3.8635,0.9623,4.9252,3.9149,3.5136,3.9149,4.3286,5.701,4.1159,2.6171,3.7414,2.2138,1.7904,0.8998,4.5495,1.4635,0.6543,0.0129,7.2705,8.7088,2.1683,3.1181,2.1286,0.4609,2.1628,0.859,0.0414,5.6264,3.1398,4.6117,5.6893,5.9609,1.4436,6.067,1.3688,3.2001,4.892,0.0474,0.6097,2.5155,0.7586]}
{"prompt":"Pro-European campaigners accused ministers of failing to take preparations for Brexit seriously enough on Thursday , after a committee of lawmakers published the government s sector-by-sector analysis on the impact of leaving the European Union","text":"Pro-European campaigners accused ministers of failing to take preparations for Brexit seriously enough on Thursday, after a committee of lawmakers published the government s sector-by-sector analysis on the impact of leaving the European Union.\nThe report, which focused on the agriculture, the environment, tourism but also industry including steel and ports, detailed how crucial it is for the British economy to continue to work closely with its partners across the Atlantic, despite the vote in 2016 to leave the EU.\nThe analysis, which examined the impact of Brexit on Britain s economic life in a sector-by-sector basis, comes at a time when the UK is considering the implications of a no-deal approach to the separation from the EU after next March 3.\nThe report, commissioned by the Treasury and the Department for Business, said: \" Brexit does not have a single, clearly defined impact on agriculture.\n\" Brexit affects both domestic and export agriculture, depending upon the domestic value added required and imports to maintain market access and produce the UK s food supply.\n\" However, given the extent of the UK s reliance on access to the European market, including from the UK s European neighbours, Brexit may have a detrimental effect on exports to and from the European Union.\n\"The government should make sure that Brexit s potential negative effect on trade with the European Union is carefully considered not just by the UK Treasury Department but by the whole of government.\"\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Sunday Times on December 12, 2020, with the headline 'UK to keep EU trade, say lawmakers'.

As NAF Deputy Administrator, he will oversee, manage, and implement a program that advances the National Nuclear Security Administration's programs and policies.\nFormer NASA Administrator Mike Griffin on Black History Month talks to our new co-anchor, Allyn Heckle from The Intercept. The administration of President Donald Trump is set to announce their nominee for the White House's secretary of labor, and the news is set to be one of the more controversial decisions President Trump has made thus far.\nPresident Trump continues to search for Secretary of Labor, and he has taken to Twitter to explain why he thinks there are so many candidates.\nAs it would be hard to live at home if you have a bad credit history, why should you let anything go against your chances for a mortgage? A credit check or credit score is an element of lending that determines the applicant\u2019s ability to repay their loan in case of default or late payments.\nThe credit score is the number between 300 and 850 that the banking institution gives to its customers, depending upon the borrower\u2019s credit history. This score determines the applicant for a loan. The higher the score, the lower the probability that the applicant will default the loan.\nThe applicant should make a minimum score of 600 to be able to stand a chance of getting a mortgage. The score could get lower from 400 to 500 for some reasons or even below 400. It becomes imperative to know what kind of impact a negative score on your credit report has.\nIf you have a low credit score, the banks will be less inclined to lend you and will prefer someone with a higher credit score.\nMany lenders will charge you a very high rate of interest, since they are convinced that it is more probable that you will default on the loan.\nNegative credit score may lead to denial of an application at the bank, and it may even lead to denial of a loan application by several lenders.\nYou may find it hard to make the payments due on time. You might find it harder to get approved for a higher loan amount by the bank.","token_len":519,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,8.7807,0.0354,3.0121,5.6045,11.1865,0.5421,0.6369,1.1035,7.849,1.058,0.2287,2.4078,3.8911,0.0001,0.0008,0.0018,0.0041,0.0001,0.0038,2.297,15.1868,0.9767,1.4522,6.9739,0.0538,0.0024,0.5238,0.6089,0.7213,3.4354,0.3447,7.0617,2.0564,2.9896,2.2615,0.0006,0.7482,2.2285,0.1502,0.8529,17.2534,0.1487,0.5567,3.7063,0.5158,0.1092,0.4691,0.2828,0.0021,0.001,0.0003,0.0023,0.0016,0.0027,0.0054,1.6638,1.3932,1.6458,7.4701,1.7007,1.1562,0.334,2.3827,0.7304,1.646,3.4786,0.0013,0.008,0.1192,0.0502,0.4489,0.2983,0.0096,0.0238,0.8064,1.0535,0.1472,0.0012,0.1914,6.8537,0.2172,0.4601,4.2198,0.1016,2.1884,1.5972,5.4509,1.3358,9.6034,5.1375,1.6158,2.6332,2.1334,4.9733,8.1028,4.97,5.9772,1.1368,0.6918,0.2969,2.0217,1.9043,5.6225,2.935,1.0406,0.2587,3.6036,2.9388,2.8159,1.9309,4.8471,1.1233,4.0079,4.9587,0.0711,0.4127,0.3918,7.1073,1.8133,4.4402,1.085,0.8094,6.4609,2.274,0.8571,4.1394,2.8344,6.2098,8.4799,4.5729,0.0375,9.5469,2.614,6.7912,5.2756,5.8295,0.0772,2.7479,0.0612,0.6994,7.9474,5.9126,11.1303,8.1931,5.1175,2.5403,4.1488,0.778,4.5114,7.5281,4.1981,1.438,0.6187,0.0124,1.9564,4.8881,0.0409,4.6874,5.0501,1.5513,1.5488,2.2771,4.4327,0.0022,3.9211,5.3723,0.0171,7.7674,1.2384,3.4908,2.2671,5.8289,1.566,4.604,0.0388,2.0487,5.5867,0.1904,0.3708,4.6385,4.1753,4.708,5.4184,0.5579,1.1356,0.3158,4.207,0.0002,0.4804,0.6549,4.0977,0.3947,6.9455,0.3549,6.8335,0.0998,6.7176,0.0752,0.3605,2.1882,1.7459,2.414,1.7141,5.0151,3.6704,1.6265,0.5574,4.4907,2.2116,0.4918,3.2946,3.4859,1.8502,2.453,0.2809,5.3799,2.0904,0.796,4.2578,5.2319,6.544,1.7048,4.1978,0.5835,6.7299,6.644,1.1257,3.3708,2.1664,3.7753,1.6308,4.3734,5.2955,1.1157,0.4708,4.6315,2.8453,1.6083,5.0032,7.207,1.804,6.5691,1.2669,7.5703,3.352,1.2598,8.478,0.7089,4.7747,5.5395,3.4618,4.3373,3.8036,3.3663,1.597,3.0954,6.6842,0.3052,8.5302,3.5329,4.8911,1.9577,8.8,14.0882,7.2392,5.1691,1.8747,0.0226,1.4263,3.0171,1.4027,3.9901,6.5421,0.885,0.5924,3.2809,7.9733,1.2923,0.3581,1.2185,2.5537,5.1409,1.6751,1.0972,2.7261,2.9568,6.5594,6.6693,0.1435,4.2387,2.4504,2.6331,7.2285,2.7632,4.3937,1.4555,2.6717,1.3093,1.9892,4.975,3.6443,0.7162,4.2649,3.1603,0.3872,0.0538,1.0829,1.4246,0.5038,3.5708,2.2769,2.6554,1.1101,4.3172,5.0043,1.5793,0.5983,1.5027,2.124,3.3866,0.1797,0.7003,0.2411,0.0389,3.264,0.293,4.4386,1.0862,0.6936,2.5691,0.4196,1.8978,6.099,0.0935,0.4489,0.7466,1.7633,5.4021,4.4663,4.3531,1.3311,3.3655,6.1099,0.1842,5.1736,1.9276,2.7645,3.8281,0.0029,5.9214,3.1056,2.742,0.6393,1.9514,0.4766,1.5241,0.7699,1.7836,3.8382,4.6544,6.2642,1.4503,5.3025,3.7266,0.3969,1.7568,3.7554,3.0378,4.4838,4.2377,2.9687,5.2521,2.514,2.6176,3.7794,6.8563,7.1386,1.7493,3.3342,2.5933,3.6329,0.0074,7.1266,1.7477,4.8355,0.291,2.5735,1.2441,0.5998,3.7551,3.3836,2.1564,0.5159,3.0949,0.7674,1.4772,0.6394,3.3118,0.9155,0.2782,0.3937,2.9699,7.0884,1.5446,3.088,3.0116,2.299,0.0298,1.0301,0.5346,6.2708,2.6969,4.9505,4.8819,1.3758,0.7636,1.5768,2.4662,0.1145,1.1048,1.2288,4.5797,2.8187,1.772,5.0779,1.885,1.5041,6.3422,1.2955,2.317,1.7526,0.0305,2.1387,6.7023,1.7837,2.1261,8.3832,0.7456,3.6576,0.9425,3.4809,8.222,0.5373,0.8808,0.3682,0.1697,1.7359,2.1669,0.2324,0.8379,1.2346,5.5677,0.0752,2.4726,1.6945,3.7207,3.9624,0.2634,7.7368,0.1274,4.0816,1.9815,5.383,1.331,1.3958,1.2143,2.5768,2.7,1.3328,1.7473,1.0723,0.1004,3.2799,0.0893,1.3332,0.3269,2.8912,3.2696,6.5637,1.9999,0.6027,0.606,4.2024,1.3639,3.6181,2.1179,1.7741,0.0352,3.1226,2.6977,3.5154,3.4923,1.3373,0.7101,1.7908,2.577,2.6808,2.6727,0.9674,2.3904,0.1454,1.84,5.3388,0.3462,0.7942,6.7516,1.7933,3.7008,4.6501,1.7013,1.7584,1.5096]}

Rubio, who chairs the Senate Natural Resources Committee, to reject the plans so that open Arctic Ocean land will not be mined or tapped for oil and gas and the \u201ccritical\u201d sea ice habitat around the North Pole will not be destroyed, endangering millions of life forms. Sen. Baldwin, who sits on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, is expected to consider the letter this week. She also is a vocal opponent of offshore oil drilling.\nBoth senators said on Thursday that they will consider the letter but did not pledge to reject it, saying they believe that opening up the ice \u201cwill have a significant impact on fish stocks \u2014 not just for wildlife in the waters off Alaska, but also for wildlife in the waters off other nations around the Arctic that rely on it for their livelihood,\u201d Sen. Baldwin wrote.\nSen. Rubio told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday that the decision to open the Arctic \u201cis up to the Alaskan government and not me.\u201d\nHowever, Sen. Baldwin, D-Wis., has indicated that she will move one step closer to an end to oil exploration in the Arctic in 2021 if current Alaska officials don\u2019t make progress.\n\u201cWe are moving forward,\u201d Sen. Baldwin told CNN in December. \u201cWe\u2019re going to push harder toward a more ambitious moratorium. It\u2019s not up to me, it\u2019s up to Alaskans on the other side of this in 2021.\u201d","token_len":519,"entropy":[7.1549,0.3239,7.8803,5.0788,0.0562,0.0175,2.9173,0.4102,3.7733,6.1136,1.9586,2.4811,0.0339,8.2421,6.5278,8.9876,5.456,3.8571,0.0012,0.0165,0.1486,2.4947,3.1427,2.1185,1.8642,3.2784,1.7551,5.1523,0.0231,5.7511,1.893,4.418,2.5028,3.6491,0.2078,1.8834,2.1581,0.609,0.0255,1.3337,2.1213,2.9047,0.4631,6.5666,0.0107,4.2625,7.5644,0.8804,0.0,0.6916,0.5654,2.9493,0.9836,0.7155,0.1537,14.7993,2.0798,0.9599,1.7548,1.3372,3.2051,0.0008,0.0018,0.0095,2.1666,0.0007,5.2956,0.0006,2.474,1.3116,0.003,0.0254,0.0542,0.2115,7.0904,0.0764,0.0754,0.0874,0.0014,0.1339,0.0388,0.008,6.3336,1.5253,4.568,2.0899,0.3552,1.6104,4.9812,4.5307,1.1186,5.2734,3.482,0.6802,3.398,0.0435,0.6585,3.765,0.6467,7.7041,0.0061,0.0015,0.595,1.8357,0.8706,2.1616,2.6491,3.1261,3.7851,0.1981,0.963,4.2038,1.8898,1.2579,1.3438,0.9008,6.9858,4.2209,0.0002,0.001,0.0044,6.1314,2.786,3.1273,5.8628,4.4098,5.1104,0.5589,7.0065,3.6241,0.7246,1.7167,0.3121,1.5529,4.3998,3.1301,0.0038,0.0156,2.1897,5.2531,2.3015,3.6709,6.2985,2.328,4.0025,1.0316,3.9429,2.7005,3.2431,4.1993,0.8506,0.2934,3.7805,1.7306,0.0004,0.6582,2.003,5.9591,1.9949,2.936,4.1077,0.8775,9.1722,4.8973,0.0039,1.456,0.9407,0.0073,2.4016,3.6494,17.607,9.763,2.052,5.6267,2.1399,5.0738,0.3407,0.1878,7.2868,3.6336,4.2584,4.9813,2.0696,3.3232,1.6104,3.0698,2.516,5.4085,7.9001,0.671,2.0489,3.0176,5.959,3.1638,0.0174,2.217,3.4894,0.0035,0.8838,4.7482,6.855,5.0178,2.1557,0.3932,1.066,1.769,4.1065,4.481,0.001,4.0602,1.2122,1.4249,4.2308,0.0564,0.5168,2.3261,0.0025,0.1532,0.1371,0.3395,4.628,0.5941,6.1536,6.4282,0.9356,6.8041,2.392,7.75,2.2744,3.0013,1.944,0.4169,5.3595,2.4247,6.7357,0.5405,0.3628,0.7101,0.1268,4.4805,4.0043,12.76,5.7197,9.4386,2.1877,5.1542,4.2694,0.3115,4.4968,6.7195,0.7484,3.8601,3.0109,1.4088,1.8997,0.0866,3.5472,3.0505,8.3423,0.0378,4.1911,0.078,5.0951,5.385,0.9958,5.0221,0.0017,0.0174,1.2541,0.6329,3.4548,0.0448,0.0751,1.7871,2.1299,0.1655,0.0406,0.0001,0.0895,0.0841,2.8636,3.8288,0.015,5.7451,0.6877,1.5296,4.0771,0.268,0.1861,4.8478,2.9537,1.9848,3.2316,3.247,1.4518,0.0557,3.9107,2.2992,0.8816,1.0977,0.203,6.9138,0.8724,2.5723,4.2827,0.4876,0.5391,0.7384,2.9966,3.4948,1.057,0.6534,4.3055,2.8042,0.0054,8.1118,0.484,6.4922,1.1308,2.8638,1.6637,1.0134,3.8346,2.0268,4.3191,3.3477,0.8063,6.1489,9.4633,1.1769,3.2579,3.945,1.3707,3.2039,1.1045,0.1279,4.5165,2.1297,6.0345,3.7375,0.8667,2.4222,4.5178,3.7902,0.5491,6.189,1.4422,1.1004,1.2377,0.0769,1.1228,0.5794,3.9599,0.9397,0.5404,3.9911,0.3,4.0717,3.0933,3.1643,0.005,4.1904,5.0395,1.6706,0.0541,1.9782,0.8626,1.7436,1.084,5.0806,9.7751,5.7678,8.8534,0.0013,0.8431,4.376,0.7841,0.2037,3.3686,0.0493,1.5573,3.7015,2.1844,1.3368,0.0011,2.2801,0.7796,0.4546,1.6475,0.2378,1.627,4.5664,0.6945,1.369,0.3194,2.6362,7.6303,0.0386,2.1889,6.1486,0.0852,1.4064,9.9536,0.0046,0.0565,1.9443,1.8563,3.2617,5.7213,0.5304,5.1692,3.1445,0.6467,5.6007,0.0092,1.5946,0.001,0.0539,2.5071,5.5165,0.0066,0.3417,0.0016,0.0239,3.5308,4.2011,0.4192,0.7542,1.343,6.0077,7.4693,1.072,0.7367,0.0786,4.0337,4.9501,0.2027,2.9837,2.7589,1.0921,0.2128,0.9722,4.3634,8.255,2.7584,6.9569,6.0964,9.0031,2.9509,2.3842,3.2544,0.1349,4.6025,3.9076,1.4263,0.5363,2.6408,1.9078,7.5654,1.8942,3.6194,1.1699,3.0304,4.1817,2.0402,1.4796,0.0025,0.5065,1.4213,4.9497,2.7321,5.1725,0.403,3.9856,0.6395,1.2724,4.839,3.3744,2.1149,2.4943,0.1062,5.3054,5.8798,5.623,2.1887,4.0887,4.6368,8.3675,3.5565,4.3498,0.912,0.2806,0.0976,2.3558,3.8994,0.136,0.5922,2.4273,3.7034,0.7762,0.0368,0.0151,0.8905,0.0197,4.8283,0.0117,0.4347,6.1957,1.2505,2.2584,0.162,0.8487,2.8187,6.0737,5.5257,0.9103,1.2247,1.253]}

Since","text":"Denmark will no longer automatically accept a quota of refugees under a U.N. resettlement program after passing a law on Wednesday that enables the government to determine how many can enter each year. Since 2010, around 21,000 refugees have received humanitarian status in the Scandinavian nation, with around 19,900 accepted for resettlement under the U.N.'s refugee resettlement program.\nThe plan was announced on Wednesday by the chairman of Norway's left-leaning opposition Socialist Left Party, Kjetil Aamodt.\nAccording to the government, the legislation will improve the nation's ability to accept refugees.\nHowever, the Danish Christian People's Party and the conservative Danish People's Party are opposed.\n\"The government shouldn't be allowed to determine whether we can accept refugees,\" Conservative Party spokesman Rune Aasen told BBC Europe. \"And I don't think that we need to accept refugees with the attitude that they are our economic competitors. We are the economic competitors for other countries in Europe.\"\nThe coalition government, which has just over 50 percent of the legislature's seats, had promised a separate law for the refugee program but had to modify the plan after the Socialist Left Party joined the majority in April after having initially opposed the law.\nUnder the new legislation, Denmark will have to set a limit for how many refugees would be allowed to come to the country each year through the refugee program. The government cannot accept too many refugees, the government said.\nThe plan is a major modification of the previous law.\nUnder the legislation, the government would determine the quotas nationwide and not only for certain regions, including the regions of Jutland, Denmark's second most populous.\n\"Now, we can see more clearly what it looks like before we sign anything in the refugee matter,\" coalition partner, the Socialist Left party, leader Michael Stane said.\nThe government's aim is to create a situation where those receiving refugee status can find employment and, for example, pay the rent they are living in a social housing project, said Stane.\n\"Of course, no one can come here as a refugee and find work after two days. But the government can make it easy for them here so that they can become able to work and pay,\" he said.\nDenmark has signed up to the U.N. refugee resettlement program, but is not one of the primary recipients under the program.\nSince 2013, about half of the refugees arriving in Denmark have come to the country under the resettlement quota.\nThe new law will be submitted to the Danish Parliament.","token_len":519,"entropy":[9.6957,5.0547,5.301,0.0469,6.2558,3.8161,3.9045,6.8402,1.2533,4.6331,5.0599,2.5406,6.4038,0.0771,0.328,0.1286,2.9109,1.1251,4.6298,8.2182,0.9526,3.6568,3.2613,2.8554,0.9478,6.4113,1.6094,2.1034,0.0472,5.7496,1.678,0.351,4.7491,2.6064,5.9238,3.071,0.5914,7.0747,4.0716,0.0861,5.6084,6.534,0.346,0.3348,1.0121,0.2861,6.5579,5.3073,2.6163,1.5257,0.8881,6.0771,2.3799,0.9747,2.5754,3.9438,5.6585,0.1287,5.4544,4.3636,3.7263,0.453,3.9913,0.28,1.9343,0.0008,0.0188,1.3274,0.0024,1.9677,1.0087,0.2341,0.2419,0.5721,14.0925,5.6537,2.4086,2.7424,2.7847,1.6981,1.06,1.6415,6.9299,0.0706,3.8966,0.0101,6.9556,0.0432,0.7519,3.4509,7.2672,7.3703,0.5515,0.7045,6.3449,6.8353,0.0002,5.718,7.1159,7.4514,0.6233,0.8546,0.7,6.2976,0.0023,1.3856,3.1229,0.9036,1.1825,5.5011,1.6419,5.2896,0.6714,5.3049,0.0076,1.9233,0.0051,2.7176,0.7068,1.9788,0.7991,4.5204,0.0229,1.5224,4.7706,7.134,7.6043,0.1779,0.0873,3.5623,0.9228,4.1134,1.9995,0.4958,0.0441,0.1086,3.2879,1.5768,5.2117,0.5509,1.2694,1.4154,1.968,6.6521,0.0006,1.829,3.5779,0.0256,5.3363,2.8564,3.6036,1.8845,0.5084,0.9706,1.8559,8.5948,0.9427,2.221,8.9815,4.7398,4.7773,2.2804,0.6586,6.4105,6.2409,0.6656,0.9151,4.2719,3.3751,1.8157,0.0008,0.5892,1.4549,2.839,3.4519,0.5797,3.1235,1.0934,5.2867,2.3632,7.6144,0.5887,1.8945,1.2644,5.3721,7.181,5.1938,1.4784,1.6955,2.7588,3.1731,3.9704,1.7175,4.0183,5.9292,0.4753,3.4698,1.1421,1.0183,0.1002,1.5682,5.4857,0.4727,2.8524,1.0357,1.8505,4.9232,4.2373,3.4195,2.7132,0.2271,0.0717,7.7445,3.1381,2.9872,0.1833,3.949,3.6583,3.0059,5.9905,3.0959,3.1272,1.7717,2.6278,2.6157,3.5793,3.4279,3.9595,7.7119,1.0635,3.2401,1.6853,2.0598,6.645,0.534,0.6989,5.5062,0.7981,5.9931,1.6229,7.3252,4.4518,5.3321,6.1501,1.243,1.0393,2.3229,0.2656,0.3059,4.5033,0.2045,1.2406,3.1581,0.122,2.6161,0.8188,2.6323,0.7585,4.4683,1.5816,3.3553,2.1381,1.9262,0.1374,0.479,4.608,0.3122,0.915,0.672,2.9618,1.1715,0.3446,0.0833,2.1762,0.0341,5.4467,0.764,2.51,1.6954,0.5394,1.8879,1.3348,7.006,2.7999,6.5274,0.0277,0.4576,1.8186,4.627,2.716,1.1224,0.7238,0.3041,1.5238,3.8485,2.2817,3.2489,2.6003,8.7601,0.5663,0.6315,3.0723,1.8005,2.7632,1.7412,3.0209,0.2624,5.3232,0.1198,1.8178,0.5138,1.5817,5.4409,2.3901,5.1356,9.8352,1.8843,6.0293,1.7219,2.5693,4.9047,2.4215,1.2743,5.547,1.7633,6.0734,1.4797,7.1146,0.1142,0.0007,0.749,3.8953,0.8166,3.5968,3.444,0.1991,2.6206,0.6854,2.6345,5.9829,1.6196,1.5337,1.6277,4.0236,5.2879,4.8372,2.1003,3.0373,4.3402,0.0011,5.1313,1.7369,6.3312,5.4223,3.6867,1.224,2.6919,7.246,0.346,7.2599,3.975,4.3375,2.6484,4.7877,0.8927,3.4384,0.598,7.0821,5.9896,5.4996,8.6331,2.0669,0.6599,0.4192,1.6992,1.7774,2.7412,5.6,0.699,0.1987,3.5426,0.4648,4.7919,0.4511,4.7581,5.3107,2.0899,0.1125,1.4771,4.4903,2.9622,1.31,4.5166,4.1879,2.6911,0.0008,5.4564,3.1403,2.2381,3.3557,2.7138,5.2755,1.3098,5.0338,6.6296,0.3406,1.4173,2.1784,4.3081,1.4687,0.0028,0.3373,0.2457,1.6268,5.495,0.0258,0.3709,5.6155,0.6187,1.9144,3.7284,1.307,4.309,0.6099,1.169,2.1145,5.8452,1.5415,5.6402,4.5204,5.8074,2.1678,1.0913,2.7206,1.4183,1.7629,3.6526,1.9755,3.3023,0.322,1.8415,6.7882,4.0232,0.894,0.6477,0.3242,4.5471,4.728,0.0072,1.6806,1.7751,2.8074,4.9057,0.5159,0.494,0.1008,0.2598,5.0016,0.0011,1.7554,7.3054,1.1771,1.4726,0.65,1.6089,0.0007,0.0331,0.6646,0.9992,0.611,0.1453,2.1701,1.924,3.3653,1.9111,5.7106,0.0519,0.6492,7.764,1.9826,5.1735,0.4934,1.5365,0.51,0.7789,4.0355,4.1895,0.115,3.3067,4.7271,0.3621,0.8887,2.126,3.0986,0.3038,0.8971,1.1175,3.2251,2.2717,0.5968,0.777,2.9672,0.5129,3.9146,5.6952,1.0469,1.0376,1.7428,3.3283,0.4729,1.3142,2.9327,6.5153,0.2101,0.5171,2.1429,1.8772,4.4699]}

Devin Nunes, D-Calif., said in an interview with NBC News that one of the key questions is \u201cwhat is the extent of Russian interference?\u201d and \u201cdo we have information about Russian influence operations in the United States?\u201d\nTwo Facebook spokespeople told NBC that the company had \u201cno intention of discussing any other matter, other than the ongoing investigation.\u201d\nNunes said the committee was also looking into whether Russian organizations have tried to influence government employees about the \u201ccoal crisis, nuclear disaster of Fukushima,\u201d climate change, voter registration and health care to move toward a more pro-European or more pro-Russia stance.\n\u201cMy intent is to keep the public informed, to know what companies have said things, what they\u2019ve done, and what their policies are on monitoring,\u201d Nunes said.\nTwo Twitter spokespeople said the companies have \u201cno knowledge\u201d of a House probe and would not comment on the investigation and any potential violations.\nThe letter, which was sent directly to companies, follows the recent announcement of several former employees at Twitter who claim to have been hired under the umbrella of a Russian-linked \u201cproject\u201d aimed at promoting the narrative of Russian influence on the U.S.\nThe House committee is also investigating whether the top executives and former employees at these three tech companies were in fact responsible for monitoring comments and tweets on social media in support of President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\nThe letter asked the companies to \u201cidentify all of the employees who have participated or participated in any work on intelligence analysis and collection or have served or served as contractors or consultants engaged in intelligence gathering.\u201d\nThe House Oversight and Reform Committee says in a statement that the recent tweets by former employees make it \u201cclear that Russian influence operated at the highest levels of these companies and that any investigation of Russian interests seeking to influence public sentiment in the U.S. must encompass not only the

But we are asking for no less than Trump\u2019s personal promise that DACA willn\u2019t be taken away without him saying something, \u201d the Dreamers \u2019 statement said.\nAccording to a report of the Washington Examiner, House Democratic lead sponsor Rep.

We have our bipartisan agreement, and so we\u2019re going to vote for that to ensure this bill gets signed into law, \u201d said Clark to the Washington Examiner.\nRep.

People have been suppressed for years,\u201d the 29-year-old told AFP, speaking on the sidelines of a recent campaign event.\nDespite that, his hopes of getting elected were dashed by an announcement that elections would be called for a year late following the collapse of a parliamentary coalition led by his coalition partner, the Patriotic Movement.\nThe call for early elections was seen as a victory by protesters who had rejected the deal, demanding justice, state of the land and the resignation of prime minister Saad al-Hariri.\nBut the vote will mark a further step towards stability and may lead to the start of a period of relative calm as Lebanon struggles to navigate its waters amid the turmoil and civil war in Yemen and Yemenis protests against the ousted president and current ruler Mansour Hadi.\n\u201cThis year is really important for Lebanon,\u201d Saba al-Hariri said in an interview published on Sunday in Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar.\n\u201cI am not hopeful of anything, though a little hope that I will be able to serve Lebanon in this year\u2019s legislative elections has appeared,\u201d she added, describing her frustration with the coalition\u2019s inability to form a new government.\nThe lack of action and the continued crisis were caused by party differences over the choice of presidential candidates - Hariri wanted to propose Hadi, but the members of the Patriotic Movement had other ideas.\nIn an attempt to put an end to the stalemate, Hariri was supposed to propose Mansour al-Kaabi, who would have served as prime minister.\nHadi won a surprise victory from a field of potential candidates less than 1 month after the protests began when he was officially named the new president by parliament on October 22.\nThe official announcement from parliament came after a series of political setbacks for Mr Hariri and his coalition including the resignation of two ministers and the resignation of another member of parliament.","token_len":521,"entropy":[9.0493,0.4421,3.4167,6.0815,2.0277,5.0446,1.5612,2.692,3.4098,6.2579,0.3524,1.526,4.1662,2.0999,0.9586,7.2735,3.2614,2.1344,4.3535,1.933,0.2569,1.6199,6.9239,5.2137,0.4989,6.288,0.0453,2.7438,1.3162,7.1418,0.4763,0.7692,8.5527,3.4119,7.3285,0.224,0.0788,3.556,0.721,0.3564,14.0468,3.6558,1.9392,0.8288,2.7476,5.0908,0.715,8.2194,8.5257,0.0021,4.9541,0.3607,4.7045,2.2824,0.0674,2.0877,4.2571,3.2242,0.0211,4.7282,0.9633,5.1947,0.6566,2.0102,8.6592,4.2632,0.7203,0.3046,4.0609,4.5215,3.8879,3.476,0.7009,4.7901,1.3701,0.0028,0.0043,4.2361,7.0011,2.3715,2.0119,7.8254,0.3098,0.1334,1.6392,0.0065,0.9177,5.5647,5.9983,0.0052,2.3863,5.2482,11.4062,7.8817,3.0816,3.8109,3.6369,3.3642,3.5294,5.0147,3.2252,0.1407,2.0019,0.2125,0.8656,1.6109,4.0598,1.0865,1.8158,1.6516,0.4758,0.007,4.2682,0.3051,0.1031,11.636,8.3399,7.6061,10.7123,9.343,2.4553,6.7337,1.7485,3.8332,5.7967,2.7738,2.0677,10.7787,2.4136,1.976,1.6703,11.8514,6.3319,4.3757,9.009,0.1673,0.0089,0.0471,0.0016,3.9309,1.3347,1.9693,4.3686,1.4574,3.1582,3.3824,0.0089,0.7575,4.1951,4.6394,2.3905,1.3982,0.564,5.3325,3.7117,0.5472,3.2706,5.2977,2.0793,3.63,2.0084,2.6089,0.8475,1.5109,3.1854,4.6703,1.9817,8.3633,0.998,0.5877,5.7679,3.2119,3.8196,2.1555,4.2063,6.1751,1.21,4.598,0.0187,1.8619,2.875,4.6455,2.8027,0.0087,3.3254,5.8744,0.7878,0.556,2.1182,6.7009,0.0001,6.1409,3.5049,0.1922,2.2259,6.9212,1.2649,4.2551,0.2495,1.4898,4.8644,0.3561,0.6919,4.5889,2.3657,6.2276,1.3615,1.5843,5.3637,1.152,5.7153,3.0116,5.7417,6.0964,3.1773,7.1604,6.6574,2.2589,5.0276,0.4251,2.0743,6.1072,0.0083,3.7034,0.0183,2.9488,0.0187,5.292,0.0012,0.0181,0.0024,0.67,0.1705,2.6027,1.6654,4.5596,3.5517,3.3221,0.6576,4.0841,3.4027,2.1457,7.3014,1.7976,5.9354,4.323,0.1156,1.8218,4.5497,0.0022,0.7089,4.5203,0.1324,4.6733,2.1917,3.6292,3.0213,2.6374,0.3885,4.8624,1.9588,7.9799,3.4213,2.0546,2.6425,2.5163,3.6695,0.1015,2.4091,4.0471,1.8219,4.5626,3.1871,9.4431,1.7205,0.8233,8.3496,1.109,3.608,7.8709,4.2399,9.048,0.0019,0.0153,0.0005,0.2216,0.1093,1.3582,0.945,4.121,4.32,2.9573,5.9295,3.0656,1.4088,3.7362,2.3929,0.2398,1.4616,8.9925,2.4259,3.1298,0.019,4.2795,0.3793,3.0767,2.1904,0.8932,0.0859,3.2488,0.7547,2.3067,2.9731,3.29,2.1102,2.0112,0.5051,2.0829,0.2816,0.02,0.3997,0.4196,1.3835,0.3278,2.7113,2.6277,2.6684,6.2072,2.0414,3.8718,1.794,7.8795,6.3766,3.8351,3.5049,2.3943,3.3511,0.9996,1.3716,0.8953,0.0159,7.2222,6.0467,2.4697,3.0985,3.7967,2.1918,2.8814,9.0581,3.3569,0.6608,8.6939,7.7087,4.7459,0.2371,1.302,3.2276,1.5248,2.3213,4.4697,2.2845,6.2168,0.8128,0.5649,5.6155,10.8955,1.9376,0.1422,2.5289,0.0128,3.9477,0.427,3.3635,0.3802,0.6044,0.1309,2.017,6.7602,0.0022,5.7222,3.4071,2.1526,4.8553,5.3716,5.7062,6.1298,0.2686,8.4955,3.9339,2.7081,1.3147,5.9809,0.1212,4.4835,1.9318,5.6372,5.9053,0.0054,6.0494,0.7711,8.3332,4.7934,0.0753,2.9139,2.6671,1.7813,8.316,0.2475,0.7951,2.4481,0.0029,0.2085,4.0371,6.3872,0.6782,0.7082,0.2012,3.6206,2.5661,2.9359,0.0147,4.4157,1.1229,0.0037,0.0063,0.5666,3.39,0.0203,0.3093,2.2541,0.0074,3.9104,6.6445,0.0026,3.3128,9.5921,0.0125,4.682,0.0009,10.5746,1.8181,0.575,2.3333,2.438,2.2821,3.8314,0.2405,2.0047,0.0039,2.4682,1.036,5.3478,0.7375,4.6097,1.7616,6.2277,1.9479,6.4697,2.5412,6.4961,0.1626,5.0955,0.9049,7.4679,0.012,5.8536,4.5478,1.0431,1.3662,6.4439,1.8779,5.7523,0.6106,1.9316,6.8968,2.5475,2.1948,1.7928,1.0436,3.4508,1.7128,1.2351,2.9991,3.743,0.1982,0.3392,2.1397,6.8862,2.1503,3.9418,2.8187,2.6635,2.4354,1.8741,3.1278,0.0007,4.4993,4.105,1.646,4.3706,1.7285,0.0123,2.1387,0.714,1.8058,8.6599,1.3951,2.7853,0.0598,4.5011,1.9972,1.6748,1.1193,2.2584,0.0179,4.7332,4.3144,0.2987,1.8194,0.6008]}

In a new poll of registered voters taken in August, Trump was unimpressed with Kasich and hinted he was still open to considering a second term as president. \u201cThey will be talking very seriously about that, \u201d Trump told Axios\u2019 Mike Gallagher. \u201cHe is an incredible governor, very good governor. \u201d\nFormer Gov. Jeb Bush, an open presidential candidate, met with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who worked as Washington lobbyist during the GOP White House and Trump businesses, Fox News reports. Bush spoke to Manafort on Monday, Fox reported. In a statement, the former Florida governor added, \u201cFor me, the most telling fact is that Paul Manafort believes it is important that my views be heard by the President-elect.\u201d\nTrump hasn\u2019t said much about Manafort since he fired the former campaign manager in July after Manafort had filed for political office, and for aiding former Russian President Vladimir Putin in his 2016 campaign. But the president has been increasingly critical of Manafort\u2019s role in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and has alleged that Manafort received $ 12 million in undeclared payments when Bush worked as CEO of the Trump Organization. In January, Manafort reportedly revealed that he planned to sell Trump Tower in New York at a substantial loss for a friend of the president who planned to live there as a result.\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is not ready to let Trump pull out of the race and support former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even as Trump intensifies his attacks on her, an aide told NBC News Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to sit down and say, \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to support Hillary,\u2019\u201d according to Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine. But, Kaine said, Biden can \u201ccome out and say, if he wants to, \u2018I\u2019ve never endorsed anybody.\u2019\u201d","token_len":522,"entropy":[11.1274,7.6483,7.8398,9.7405,5.6994,2.3771,5.0302,0.0356,1.1894,3.4835,6.8017,2.421,0.0469,0.0456,0.0003,0.0001,0.0,1.8889,4.2068,1.9815,0.6492,2.4319,6.2102,1.8468,4.1944,0.3316,2.4241,5.3007,6.6588,1.2817,1.0538,0.9901,0.0006,2.2456,1.9789,1.9478,9.6868,0.0033,6.4278,2.4936,3.3731,0.1031,6.7606,2.0392,3.1124,4.9022,2.1491,2.2449,1.2587,0.9216,1.7654,3.4162,4.5282,6.6984,4.35,3.5984,0.8301,1.2279,2.5438,5.8184,0.8987,7.0733,4.8795,1.1915,6.262,1.8034,0.0381,1.2693,3.6269,2.5452,0.6541,4.2726,8.7377,3.6171,2.855,0.9246,3.451,0.0565,1.3868,4.4929,6.6107,2.5319,0.1794,1.2523,6.7278,1.0832,1.2318,2.7818,0.7789,2.8737,4.8891,2.7995,0.5993,2.9329,1.573,2.1444,1.2909,5.7651,2.6067,2.0697,0.8954,1.4773,4.4958,2.3341,0.0101,2.6082,1.6714,2.6443,2.0736,1.2421,6.9133,0.0061,11.3218,0.6554,6.9249,3.9425,1.1924,2.3001,6.8869,1.2016,4.5332,2.8362,1.3577,3.6547,0.5677,1.3345,0.8417,4.1939,1.8498,4.9794,3.2407,3.047,3.5145,0.3796,5.4029,2.0867,3.5469,0.3117,2.3214,2.7858,7.7214,1.8016,0.0275,0.8001,0.8605,2.6146,8.3614,1.6368,2.8113,4.5952,3.1868,0.1084,4.8463,0.8252,2.9663,4.0989,3.7012,2.8228,0.3177,5.9615,5.4665,10.1987,4.071,2.1203,4.4183,5.8328,2.4079,0.4646,2.131,1.8775,6.4452,6.3008,4.7447,1.3887,2.5547,0.0396,4.2989,0.4625,10.7453,4.2892,2.4612,2.6997,1.0655,2.81,2.7177,4.3158,3.7166,2.6165,1.2626,4.5555,3.0433,3.6891,1.5419,2.1783,1.3095,4.5182,15.9966,3.2637,0.0846,1.8266,0.0044,1.5724,4.5714,5.7933,4.7136,0.2993,0.4068,6.0234,0.2664,3.8363,4.527,0.586,1.3703,0.1241,0.007,2.4813,1.5976,3.6776,2.1108,7.5359,1.223,3.8584,0.2936,4.7615,8.734,0.0026,4.27,4.9772,11.2106,1.8585,6.4168,0.142,1.1524,0.107,2.0961,4.0379,1.8837,1.5271,2.235,2.6722,1.3942,4.4245,4.2797,0.402,4.2804,1.374,1.1126,0.7253,2.465,2.2922,0.67,0.0724,3.9191,1.3506,7.8047,3.4325,5.7188,2.6688,0.4151,2.058,3.0278,6.2441,4.8448,0.5797,0.5032,4.2351,0.6752,7.796,3.8606,0.9204,2.4799,2.1504,6.102,6.7017,1.6707,2.1314,3.2324,0.845,5.6594,2.6459,0.123,1.1661,4.9416,2.9109,1.7728,2.6836,6.6309,8.7679,3.6681,0.8811,2.7903,2.8667,0.4935,2.7395,3.3796,2.0663,5.8171,2.7255,1.4824,0.816,1.2895,2.133,2.1442,3.815,3.1222,4.2319,5.7148,1.4733,5.3093,3.0981,2.0875,2.7067,6.332,13.5869,4.3555,3.2948,0.8695,0.4713,0.0054,1.0308,1.1559,4.019,1.4706,0.483,2.2733,2.6551,2.5944,3.1756,2.5319,4.6259,1.2562,0.0371,0.421,5.4766,0.5685,3.8525,3.4542,0.2143,0.8965,6.5759,0.2139,1.4527,0.8306,0.1275,0.1018,0.2585,0.3827,1.6077,3.0068,6.6732,0.6976,2.8747,5.0116,2.8908,13.8262,0.4038,1.0693,10.1526,0.001,0.0,3.0038,6.1281,9.3416,3.9016,1.4349,7.7637,0.1198,1.1916,2.3489,0.2659,0.6308,3.0383,3.8576,0.124,3.6347,4.216,6.5003,1.1875,0.5198,7.6045,0.0643,4.7341,3.5046,2.9364,0.8966,0.2875,0.0243,5.618,1.4102,7.4523,3.9694,2.5331,2.72,8.8136,3.9527,1.5147,1.1255,4.4407,7.1449,0.12,6.3065,0.7979,3.2887,0.6795,5.0509,0.989,1.0412,4.2241,4.3778,0.0607,1.5039,0.001,2.9484,4.4131,5.8344,0.1303,6.2265,1.0579,6.1224,2.4271,0.2064,0.3387,0.5467,4.0072,5.7413,3.9185,3.3697,0.0176,0.0107,0.3153,0.0223,6.3228,2.8133,3.2884,8.4771,0.0047,0.2227,1.2467,0.1626,1.4141,2.3476,6.1061,3.0258,0.9781,4.0534,0.2643,5.766,0.2413,4.1975,0.958,2.9146,5.2895,0.7124,0.1252,1.6971,1.2857,0.0755,5.1414,2.1208,0.6407,2.3121,1.0983,3.8278,5.1974,3.9126,0.2277,2.8365,5.3706,2.9485,1.498,0.6405,0.0355,5.5486,1.1273,2.3756,4.756,1.9447,4.8822,3.1232,6.0192,0.0039,6.3121,7.0889,0.1113,1.5266,1.1561,0.0014,0.6037,3.4232,2.4708,4.5121,1.2456,0.4334,3.5839,4.5842,4.0311,1.7933,5.9036,2.2381,0.4384,0.5889,0.7715,4.5039,1.8193,1.2935,0.3594,1.134,1.1561,1.7855,1.795,2.3592,1.5628,3.9704,4.3036,3.9639,3.4534,1.8707,1.9732,2.7677,4.4704,0.9928]}
{"prompt":"British foreign minister Boris Johnson told his Russian counterpart on Friday there was abundant evidence of Moscow meddling in foreign elections , but said any Russian efforts to interfere in last year s Brexit referendum","text":"British foreign minister Boris Johnson told his Russian counterpart on Friday there was abundant evidence of Moscow meddling in foreign elections, but said any Russian efforts to interfere in last year s Brexit referendum were \"not successful\". But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said he believes election meddling does happen. \"We can clearly see that a number of these countries have been engaged in the activities that we believe are election meddling,\" Mr Johnson told a joint news conference on Friday. \"What we also know is that Russia has been involved in activities with the aim of interfering with elections.\" He told Vladimir Lavrov there was ample evidence of Moscow meddling in the 2016 referendum on Britain s EU membership. Russia denies allegations of meddling in Britain s vote to leave the EU which it said was not more than a referendum on British sovereignty. Mr Johnson said the EU had become \"totally unrecognisable\" for British businesses by trying to enforce European laws through legislation. \"We see legislation here that seems to us... to be designed to impede the operation of British businesses,\" he said. Speaking with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull a day earlier, Mr Johnson called for new sanctions on Russia, accusing it of \"censorship and intimidation\" in its response to the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had \"no need\" of foreign interference in its elections, but added his country would not stop working on the issue. \"The Kremlin has no need to interfere in the processes on foreign soil in a bid to achieve some other result. Nobody would be able to force us to do so. But we will certainly continue working on the issue,\" Mr Lavrov told reporters. \"Meddling in our processes has no place.\" It was unclear if Russia held any intelligence on Mrs May s campaign team but Mr Lavrov confirmed there were \"no special preparations or operations\" undertaken to sway her vote. There was mounting evidence of possible Russian meddling in Britain s voting. The British opposition Labour party alleged it had hacked government systems. Britain, Canada and Australia had all identified instances after Britain s Brexit vote against its EU membership when a spate of malware appeared on computer systems linked to the EU. Mr Hunt, who made his first visit to Asia since British voters decided to leave the EU, has promised to strengthen cooperation with Japan. On Friday, he called on Japan to take greater steps against North Korea and said he was open to a visit to Tokyo by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Snyder (chief of staff to U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan) \u2014 contend that \u201cDonald Trump is not the only federal lawmaker to express views on the authority to fill the Consumer Finance Director vacancy. Senators and Representatives have spoken in the congressional record and on the telephone about the authority to fill the vacancy and are well aware of the legal and constitutional questions that surround the issue.\u201d\nThe Trump administration is reportedly considering naming a former federal prosecutor \u2014 the head of the Division of Consumer Financial Protection and Advocacy (DCFPA) \u2014 to replace the CFB director.\nAn aide to White House national security advisor John Bolton told CNN that the White House has contacted the attorney general\u2019s office asking if Trump has the legal power to select that candidate.\n\u201cThe Attorney General does have the power to do this,\u201d the aide said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not sure how important that is today.\u201d\nThe DCFPA is charged with protecting consumers from predatory lending practices, including high interest levels and \u201cswipe\u201d schemes where a borrower may be charged fees or penalty fees that have little or nothing to do with their loan.\nIn recent months, the CFPB has focused its investigations on whether borrowers are being charged too high on interest rates and other fees. The bureau also has taken an aggressive position on lending terms in subprime, and even some prime, loans.\nThe agency has also launched a campaign to warn consumers about potential \u201cdirty tricks\u201d that credit managers try to sell to consumers on the phone.\nThe CFPB is reviewing more than 6,000 complaints on auto loans from 2017 to 2018. The bureau says the numbers are too high to be random.","token_len":523,"entropy":[6.6897,7.8131,1.3607,0.9191,3.747,0.0323,0.024,0.0492,6.4979,0.5987,0.0005,0.0016,2.5448,7.6355,0.0015,0.0008,0.896,2.4122,5.5255,0.2454,6.859,1.1404,0.0081,2.7459,3.4801,1.0947,0.1751,7.897,5.2874,7.2996,1.2394,1.5393,6.9402,3.6804,1.0085,0.0011,0.1217,0.1889,1.6711,1.7908,2.1941,0.2414,0.2625,24.0868,0.1299,0.0687,0.0002,2.6762,3.9809,2.4863,3.0615,2.9037,0.3396,2.5695,0.9482,0.9007,2.9567,6.4352,0.8642,0.5436,6.449,2.2261,3.7844,3.8216,3.8261,0.0799,5.2488,1.9169,0.9375,3.2577,1.6627,1.1617,2.1312,1.2554,2.4016,0.4111,2.3547,3.0237,1.2436,0.7532,5.6762,0.1428,5.2356,1.1292,4.4434,0.7976,3.7598,6.4593,2.0442,3.2448,4.3262,0.4868,0.6556,0.5039,8.1282,1.6052,3.3572,2.0276,6.3582,1.059,2.539,7.6756,1.9186,0.5196,1.57,14.4103,7.5987,6.068,3.85,4.1108,3.4189,4.0805,1.4752,5.6891,0.8244,1.3722,3.7677,6.26,6.7509,0.4191,0.6658,4.1998,6.6523,6.5544,5.8697,4.4541,6.4777,3.9243,3.1291,0.6724,3.2073,0.6413,0.0664,0.4077,5.1816,0.0005,0.005,0.0024,3.822,5.087,0.1941,3.5148,1.3104,3.8133,4.0265,4.595,0.0502,7.5156,9.3291,0.3036,1.5607,0.4547,3.0861,5.8261,1.5301,3.3359,3.0288,0.0959,4.4605,10.7959,0.3929,0.351,4.5518,1.8875,0.0237,8.004,0.1863,4.4133,1.3431,0.2108,0.19,3.2592,0.0003,0.0037,0.001,2.3177,6.0645,0.0163,0.0001,0.0,0.2124,0.0098,0.3453,0.2043,5.1967,0.1238,13.3454,8.0528,5.4112,0.3306,2.1452,2.0409,1.6071,1.1069,5.2771,7.6034,1.803,4.6641,5.6246,1.0992,1.0172,7.4672,2.0933,3.8209,0.6018,7.7983,7.0961,6.294,3.0346,0.2698,8.2939,4.0139,3.5187,1.82,4.0747,3.152,3.2784,9.8764,2.5535,3.2965,3.105,0.8012,4.1829,1.448,0.8719,4.0757,0.9032,1.1791,0.2513,4.2685,3.1722,3.9308,5.8318,0.3748,0.3615,0.5393,5.0653,2.6441,2.685,3.1837,1.7674,2.4766,1.0733,3.9405,0.3279,6.3034,7.2198,0.3985,1.6049,6.2302,0.3439,2.0769,3.8454,1.1662,5.3825,1.0234,4.8183,3.0611,1.1804,5.789,3.7034,3.5306,0.0134,0.2847,6.3402,0.0106,2.5415,1.5167,0.13,3.4869,6.1762,0.0755,2.2868,2.322,0.4207,1.9803,0.3443,0.4491,0.7543,2.4335,1.0224,7.716,2.5907,1.2261,1.0443,1.389,6.2191,3.8296,0.4014,5.4826,0.0027,5.4792,0.0306,1.9923,5.5486,3.3692,1.6065,2.7663,1.2266,0.9754,2.3528,0.0011,1.8933,6.8205,1.3422,4.6301,0.0148,6.9788,1.6371,0.0917,0.094,3.9639,2.5096,3.3575,2.6323,1.1114,3.7348,3.4331,0.1678,4.9384,4.0267,6.4454,0.5299,0.6679,3.7159,2.6713,2.7791,4.7311,0.0016,5.4377,1.7204,0.2488,1.6267,0.2726,5.3126,2.9602,1.0597,5.0793,2.4297,1.686,0.9918,0.5629,0.4626,4.4462,0.565,4.2355,7.2195,7.0934,3.6142,5.413,2.5337,1.2612,2.5451,6.1034,1.1345,0.4985,7.3907,0.7616,1.4203,1.332,0.3976,1.7391,4.2952,0.0024,0.0114,1.2976,3.1821,0.0505,2.7224,0.4797,0.504,1.5141,1.0421,0.4901,1.7662,1.6791,5.8924,1.3757,10.9052,1.2606,15.506,0.6853,7.8136,3.95,4.6332,2.639,7.7632,4.3562,2.9723,1.5753,4.0537,3.1919,2.6692,5.5877,2.6709,4.4165,2.5119,2.8346,4.4865,2.7361,1.0816,3.568,0.009,0.0012,0.0009,2.9125,4.8992,1.0343,1.0819,2.532,3.9924,1.0952,0.0634,1.0183,3.6687,0.0026,0.0011,0.1529,5.6955,2.0002,3.0223,0.9704,5.6359,5.1348,2.11,2.1655,2.7017,2.3147,2.2527,7.0656,3.9734,0.4935,1.7081,3.7273,1.8966,1.482,1.8525,1.9102,2.5971,0.9106,3.7277,3.5266,2.0166,2.7414,1.1534,4.1761,8.3375,3.4427,5.2178,0.0029,3.2902,4.547,5.1661,4.4952,8.0893,4.8402,2.5799,0.6162,0.6033,1.7347,2.6981,1.1125,1.3856,3.7434,1.0363,3.676,0.4699,7.2416,1.8931,0.9127,4.0099,11.6819,0.2049,10.5385,0.3622,0.967,1.6708,2.0741,7.271,6.4379,6.2506,0.0105,3.7229,0.9736,2.4824,3.7745,0.87,7.6882,0.7558,0.6656,1.8191,2.3622,0.0039,0.0028,1.8932,5.6405,4.7505,0.2306,4.631,0.2232,0.4854,1.9978,5.236,8.6686,1.335,3.0812,4.7559,0.73,0.7857,1.4521,1.6461,2.2041,4.4065,2.5285,3.7243,1.1608,4.4031,1.6335,1.523,1.2176,8.1995,1.4109]}
{"prompt":"The Central Intelligence Agency thought for months that it had mistakenly shredded a massive U.S. Senate report on its use of waterboarding and other \u201c enhanced interrogation techniques \u201d before suddenly discovering that its copy","text":"The Central Intelligence Agency thought for months that it had mistakenly shredded a massive U.S. Senate report on its use of waterboarding and other \u201c enhanced interrogation techniques \u201d before suddenly discovering that its copy was indeed gone ( CNN, 16 August 2004 ).\nIt then quickly dispatched a special agent to Pakistan to bring a copy back.\nBut when he arrived, the report turned out to be nowhere to be found as well.\nThe U.S. Government claims to have lost a copy of a dossier produced by a CIA unit in Pakistan after a raid on a suspected al-Qaeda compound in Pakistan in June 2004.\u201d The dossier was produced for the CIA headquarters and was designed to help agents monitor the movement and intentions of al-Qaeda militants living throughout the Arab world. It contained intelligence gathered by a CIA agent operating out of the Pakistani border town of Rahim Yar Khan, near the Afghan border. The dossier contained detailed information on the suspected al-Qaeda operatives working with agents of the Pakistani intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence.\nDespite claims made by media accounts that agents of the CIA had unlawfully carried out the raid on the compound, there is no official or independent evidence that they had.\nThe government has denied ever having seen the dossier until August 2004, when it finally confessed that its own intelligence services had failed in their mission and left the dossier there unnoticed.\nThe documents apparently disappeared following a raid on a suspected al-Qaeda compound in northern Pakistan in June 2004. The operation was led by a CIA agent and was part of an ongoing CIA programme known as the \u201cglobal monitoring operation\u201d. Since September 2004 the CIA has refused to reveal anything about the dossier.\nIt is rumoured that the CIA destroyed a copy of the dossier. There is no independent evidence of the dossier\u2019s whereabouts, whether destroyed or still stored somewhere. According to documents released by the CIA, the operation was justified by the risk that the people being monitored were going to attack Western diplomatic missions overseas.\nAs for the alleged dossier containing material on bin Laden\u2019s base and other al-Qaeda targets in Pakistan, the CIA was able to confirm the existence of the dossiers, but denied that they were part of the global monitoring operation.\nThe United States of America and its Western partners have been conducting covert operations since the 1970s to try and neutralize al-Qaeda. By 1999, the United States had developed a comprehensive strategy \u2013 called \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d \u2013 that aimed to destroy al-Qaeda\u2019s capacity to launch terrorist attacks anywhere in the world.","token_len":523,"entropy":[8.9602,2.0013,0.001,8.3231,6.2959,3.751,0.5729,2.8209,1.2287,9.1949,9.7554,2.2797,4.697,5.4884,0.0124,0.0047,0.154,6.6701,1.8863,1.391,4.6056,3.6748,0.0041,6.6186,0.2202,2.4871,0.8641,18.2103,6.364,8.9844,0.1206,0.1807,5.9251,5.7915,4.5831,6.8324,4.1135,1.1079,3.1847,8.0972,1.6,5.2157,6.2809,6.0783,11.3498,2.484,5.3806,3.3907,3.2811,3.111,1.0149,7.8167,5.2406,4.9753,6.493,1.3287,3.2586,1.6293,0.4295,5.6241,0.7254,5.42,3.7747,3.3377,1.8415,2.518,2.427,3.7531,3.3863,2.5897,1.0518,0.8814,1.3656,2.927,5.753,0.4169,0.0876,0.3073,6.963,0.7211,0.001,0.1025,6.2347,3.5894,0.791,1.1453,1.8504,3.8991,0.0008,0.0352,0.0461,3.607,5.5775,3.029,0.1234,3.9288,2.8966,1.3231,0.1762,3.2142,5.9787,4.9669,0.1512,2.7417,3.5528,4.5482,1.8577,1.3741,4.3623,2.9861,5.1353,0.8588,1.4759,3.3255,3.0408,1.2982,0.3656,2.5236,0.5759,2.8469,1.5202,3.8022,1.5231,0.4501,9.0506,3.7931,2.2721,3.6275,1.8083,4.1751,3.4584,1.2752,1.5667,7.7114,3.2444,1.9709,6.591,0.173,3.0352,6.3729,4.951,2.0516,3.3285,3.2699,6.4284,0.0078,1.2488,0.1708,0.0623,3.0037,5.7292,6.4335,0.7978,6.7922,0.1983,0.4724,2.3944,2.7389,4.3841,5.3646,1.5509,2.245,1.9441,4.3668,6.3717,3.0746,0.0116,1.1201,3.3938,2.6823,2.5389,0.0136,7.8291,2.469,9.5423,4.1736,1.8986,4.1793,1.0075,2.3602,0.0657,0.7106,1.871,3.1598,2.1903,4.314,1.2404,1.4553,1.3742,5.2298,2.1333,0.0605,0.0399,2.2095,4.7868,2.5102,6.7622,1.5257,0.7639,1.4404,2.1899,0.802,1.5596,1.9498,4.1814,0.2181,0.0134,0.0143,1.8489,1.2643,5.1025,4.4615,2.7316,0.2919,6.3579,4.6532,1.5465,7.5146,0.6715,0.2483,1.9449,1.412,7.7433,5.3189,0.0299,1.4472,1.982,1.1879,0.511,0.917,0.3226,3.2903,1.2407,0.3819,3.7575,6.4422,4.0723,0.9409,1.0143,2.5352,1.6724,0.7104,1.4377,1.5898,4.9684,2.194,3.3499,4.6445,1.0073,4.4822,0.5108,1.0158,5.5037,5.8786,0.7591,1.0713,0.4,1.2177,3.4058,6.7345,1.9029,2.5219,4.1992,3.5243,5.13,0.2779,3.605,4.2812,0.6816,2.7395,2.3665,5.3018,1.3195,2.8512,4.953,6.5782,0.4563,0.8573,1.5882,5.2597,6.4139,4.2596,6.2212,1.5095,3.9389,0.7412,1.7654,1.7948,0.5096,0.0244,0.0162,0.1849,0.1824,5.6352,0.5499,1.2272,1.3045,0.1068,0.4706,1.9933,5.3441,1.1203,3.2527,0.0195,1.8833,2.4712,1.6182,2.9449,1.9108,4.4749,0.0084,1.5646,2.5597,3.2508,4.699,3.6416,0.0181,1.6649,8.6766,1.465,9.8224,4.5069,3.2179,1.5613,0.7389,3.0196,5.6265,4.2509,0.7248,3.0504,1.333,0.6924,4.6692,0.0598,3.4528,5.094,0.7965,0.9039,2.3808,1.6464,0.5728,3.3608,1.1945,7.1169,0.0477,0.107,0.9222,1.3945,4.7851,2.1886,1.3586,0.0437,0.1404,0.5551,3.5194,5.1173,0.7082,0.7845,4.9069,0.609,2.5718,2.2832,4.0405,11.2349,6.7483,6.8629,2.5493,2.4969,4.6871,5.6064,0.1331,4.5062,4.1336,5.9075,1.1635,5.2253,0.0015,4.9455,2.7558,0.4378,0.7408,2.5247,1.5749,1.0569,5.0825,0.6793,7.5452,1.9992,1.1017,6.0163,1.2457,1.5022,6.6007,4.9028,1.0895,3.4329,4.4513,0.0613,4.3189,5.4417,4.1126,1.8363,6.0274,0.658,0.6651,4.6737,3.13,0.4591,3.1269,4.9089,4.1684,4.7864,2.3681,4.8015,0.004,2.256,1.2298,0.3032,8.6691,3.4844,3.1508,2.5961,0.1146,0.0278,2.875,2.2093,0.7073,0.2041,1.2197,1.4833,3.8652,3.2918,0.0236,5.0521,2.4962,0.9586,0.0948,1.1714,7.9409,0.0324,0.0034,3.9551,1.3717,4.0306,1.3874,1.2182,1.4656,3.6475,0.0012,1.5589,5.1662,0.4264,0.3736,0.4269,0.5737,1.5302,3.6123,0.1779,5.619,0.0127,3.2728,1.1818,4.0505,2.2657,1.2705,1.9636,3.7735,2.8739,0.6153,3.7067,1.1325,3.837,0.0501,1.4659,3.6515,1.1112,5.4164,0.3275,1.6854,0.0721,0.0313,1.7193,5.82,5.3881,0.65,0.9401,1.5159,0.0683,0.6817,5.2722,0.88,4.8132,1.8208,8.5553,3.7479,6.7037,1.4816,3.7324,1.6601,0.6582,3.1295,0.7764,2.0056,2.7376,0.1584,3.6038,0.5847,0.0244,0.0227,5.8499,0.0523,0.0057,5.7547,0.1749,4.3422,2.419,0.0667,3.9825,0.4289,0.0162,0.0519,0.3211]}

Raytheon is tasked with manufacturing missiles for the AGM-154 Shrike surface to air cruise missiles used for close air support missions. The U.S. military has ordered 5, 000 missiles for the Shrike by end of 2011, with a total of 18, 000 missiles ordered through 2015. The $ 614 million contract provides missiles in a two-year support extension. Raytheon is tasked with producing new launchers, missile sets, spares, parts kits and software updates. Raytheon is also responsible for maintaining the existing AGM-154 inventory.\nPresident Barack Obama on Thursday gave congressional Republicans just five days to agree to funding his $ 6.5 trillion healthcare legislation, promising that a deal would include \" important health insurance options\", but not necessarily universal coverage. \"I am prepared to negotiate with the Republican leadership,\" Obama told news reporters in an interview during a visit to Louisiana, but without saying what the GOP might agree to to move the bill through. He did say that he saw little reason for delay in the bill, given the overwhelming support Congress has shown before the House has failed to act on it.\nCongressional Republicans have insisted their \"Plan B\" for a health care bill is better than President Obama's, insisting the former President's legislation would cost trillions of dollars to implement and increase debt over time. But they say that while they will consider legislation from the President, the Republican health reform law that they tried to pass has not been supported by enough Senate Democrats. \"We have not made every concession of Plan B, but all of them can be turned to good use as we move forward,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, of a health care bill he has written that would replace the current, failing federal government system with private insurers that would set premiums and reimbursement rates.\nThe Obama administration is planning to launch a massive advertising campaign to recruit millions of young people to enrol in Obamacare, a top official told CNN. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will host a Web site at the end of the summer that will help anyone considering Obamacare navigate complicated information, the official told CNN in an interview. CNN has not confirmed the comments of the top official about the advertising campaign. \"We know that more Americans want to enroll in health care, regardless of their income, when they are young, and the Obama administration is taking the next step to make that possible.\"","token_len":523,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,6.4079,0.2536,6.445,7.4508,0.0091,0.0,1.7651,1.0802,11.624,5.7265,0.1826,7.8657,2.2253,1.8612,5.4839,7.4404,4.5344,0.0178,0.2955,9.4678,0.0491,2.0491,2.2266,1.9272,0.6385,1.5128,0.2522,0.3362,2.6198,1.9364,0.0904,3.0787,0.0004,0.0006,2.4306,6.8761,0.0399,4.0732,4.7222,1.2894,0.8329,9.0939,0.5472,0.9176,6.1582,9.4662,0.706,6.0809,2.577,0.21,6.4841,2.5866,5.8079,3.5294,6.5134,0.5715,0.0256,2.1562,0.6548,1.5796,3.3066,0.0006,0.0029,0.0042,2.48,1.956,4.1605,6.1248,1.3951,9.6049,3.6159,1.344,0.6816,3.1721,0.0112,4.8745,5.7163,0.0767,4.1977,1.145,3.2867,2.3522,1.6487,0.5905,4.366,0.5587,3.5713,2.0775,3.9718,4.4568,4.1251,0.4062,1.5419,4.7914,1.5339,0.0415,0.0465,2.0955,4.3659,9.1725,4.7071,2.7813,5.6699,0.1618,3.0005,7.3485,7.7213,1.9843,2.0323,0.0006,0.0005,1.9943,5.619,0.0181,2.5088,5.1007,5.9166,2.0174,4.417,7.7566,0.5734,8.7745,0.0412,0.6655,4.9623,5.1402,0.8116,5.7142,5.9856,2.0499,2.2887,0.0013,0.001,1.7978,1.1489,3.0413,0.0037,4.851,1.3094,4.5431,4.8756,0.0166,0.1231,0.5124,5.6016,1.413,1.9035,13.6469,1.0428,0.0025,3.2047,2.9564,5.0289,4.7066,3.6635,6.3108,2.9864,0.3565,0.0688,5.2074,0.6051,5.5644,5.8148,3.8843,4.19,3.5982,1.4471,3.1657,7.154,4.1822,1.269,5.6595,2.5144,3.7687,2.6662,1.3079,3.4914,2.9668,12.9901,4.4004,5.0204,4.8417,9.5868,2.2579,3.6427,4.5267,4.7537,0.2955,0.7014,2.1638,2.2464,1.9516,4.6634,0.0963,2.7241,1.4064,1.8898,2.8054,1.0264,4.2849,0.325,1.87,6.743,1.5803,1.9795,3.6805,0.4901,5.4208,0.6729,1.3537,0.0447,6.492,2.4711,5.0003,6.4071,3.0804,2.0075,2.622,3.903,4.3021,3.9112,0.4091,5.7758,6.1901,3.3211,0.8665,2.0249,1.8244,3.1528,2.6987,1.5569,0.8327,1.482,6.7474,5.049,2.1921,1.8723,3.9276,1.7544,1.3934,2.0106,1.4083,3.8558,0.9586,6.4681,1.4668,5.8889,0.7569,2.8256,7.1809,1.7015,1.5508,5.9711,4.263,0.0467,3.686,0.934,2.0351,0.2046,1.4507,5.1347,1.6975,1.0449,1.1891,5.2934,4.6009,4.7803,6.9663,0.0238,0.0468,2.2012,3.3771,2.3744,0.5256,0.7624,1.8513,5.6681,0.3009,4.7823,0.6858,0.1051,2.3348,3.6406,2.3689,6.3915,3.167,2.1662,4.937,1.4104,4.237,4.1781,0.3817,0.0077,3.9864,1.5864,1.1997,4.8424,8.66,3.2453,1.9803,0.3386,2.788,3.252,2.7463,2.0927,3.8037,2.2992,3.0007,5.1592,4.1275,4.8412,1.2326,3.7857,1.7408,2.2602,4.1911,4.8812,5.3702,4.0709,4.0014,2.5572,7.3799,0.214,0.6776,4.7519,2.2969,1.5092,5.6423,0.2731,2.7388,3.8212,2.111,1.4924,2.082,1.8726,2.1712,2.2119,3.641,6.4874,6.9561,3.974,11.5635,0.0633,2.3761,1.154,5.3881,1.2924,1.2271,5.2971,0.7479,6.2042,4.0393,5.4825,2.5733,4.3362,2.1898,1.904,0.2598,0.7242,1.0134,2.8334,1.4422,0.1589,0.2475,0.0005,1.1183,0.268,0.005,0.1365,4.6278,5.1499,2.9984,5.407,0.3872,0.4463,3.266,2.6889,5.1301,2.4159,0.9583,3.8883,1.149,3.1899,5.6333,5.5642,5.7894,3.0107,4.1596,1.3076,4.4754,2.299,2.68,0.7993,5.3378,1.2972,1.6873,6.3845,0.3196,1.1929,1.4037,2.2347,3.5382,0.231,2.3465,4.6097,0.37,4.6798,0.7169,3.7368,6.8821,0.3169,1.5712,6.1708,5.2846,0.1446,3.5041,1.0802,0.5553,6.9178,0.1614,1.9517,1.4378,2.9703,5.6166,5.7588,1.2079,3.0497,1.0874,5.626,3.1274,0.1638,0.0107,0.036,0.3573,0.0016,0.0001,0.0,3.4585,4.1902,0.565,8.0011,3.9656,3.4696,1.3259,2.4436,0.0008,0.7507,6.3332,2.5932,0.6336,4.2151,6.6777,6.0153,4.4715,6.1209,8.8264,5.1217,2.4748,2.4907,0.0958,3.0973,0.3099,4.2363,0.1719,0.4733,0.3886,6.0612,2.3627,1.2106,1.9145,0.9217,7.0614,3.7378,0.7722,3.5883,0.4709,4.8877,0.8388,3.5539,0.7825,0.7338,2.9852,1.3164,4.356,1.1017,5.4743,3.8118,3.0239,0.5164,2.7417,0.6828,1.6511,1.0459,1.7098,7.0703,0.031,1.5917,2.1715,1.1771,5.193,0.8725,2.4843,3.2152,1.4608,2.2085,3.3528,3.9629,0.2298,0.9831,3.9244,2.775,3.5543,0.2596,1.9273,2.3997,1.9229,2.0435,4.5923]}

Ramaphosa s political abilities have been apparent for some time and this is a great time to put them to the testing of a presidential campaign\nI had the privilege of taking part in the 2014 General Assembly \u2013 World Vision Congress on Friday, January 31 when I met our World Vision Representative for the Philippines, Ms. Jossie Manalo in her capacity as the President of the Youth Leaders Group.\nWith a background in international business and operations management, Ms. Manalo became a World Vision Member in 2009. As part of her duties, she leads our program for the youth at the youth organization she works for as part of her mandate. One of the most impactful areas in which World Vision helps young people in the Philippines is a comprehensive and robust prevention program. In 2015, we will be expanding this program, building more schools so we will be able to reach a greater number of young Filipinos.\nIt was fantastic to meet Ms. Manalo in person during the 2014 General Assembly. She is an inspiring woman who is passionate about empowering young people in her country and in the world in general. I highly recommended our organization to Ms. Manalo. We are so excited to continue to work together during this exciting election cycle in her country.\nThanks for reading. I\u2019ll be back on Monday with a new post on the election in the Philippines. In the meantime, you can follow along on the latest news on World Vision\u2019s election team through the hashtag #WorldVisionElection. Thanks for being a part of this.

{"prompt":"The United States still has credibility as a mediator with both Israel and the Palestinians , U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Friday after President Donald Trump s decision earlier","text":"The United States still has credibility as a mediator with both Israel and the Palestinians, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Friday after President Donald Trump s decision earlier this month to withdraw the United States from the 2015 deal to curb Iran s nuclear program.The president will be leaving us before he gets there but we will be there, Haley said of the peace deal.Trump has not formally withdrawn the United States from the deal but he took a hard line against the agreement with a recent announcement that the United States would no longer fulfill its financial commitments to the United Nations Security Council agency that monitors compliance.The Trump administration has said it would restore full sanctions on Iran, which are already more severe than the restrictions that the U.S. imposed under the 2015 agreement. The move by Washington was part of a campaign to pressure Tehran to take more steps toward halting its nuclear program, including by pulling the country s diplomatic representatives from the U.N. and the International Atomic Energy Agency.A U.N. panel, which was established to investigate Iran s compliance, is due to conclude its investigation in March. Iran has said the panel is politically motivated and an act of blackmail.BAGDAD - Iraqi forces killed at least four people in Baghdad on Saturday morning in a series of explosions in the capital, two of them suicide bombers, near buildings used by Iranian foreign ministry officials, police said.Hundreds of soldiers and local police were deployed in heavily fortified security checks around the headquarters of the diplomatic mission, the interior ministry said in a statement. A suicide bomber carried out his attack on cars belonging to Iranian diplomats by using a gas cylinder. At least four more wounded in the attack.The U.S. embassy in Baghdad said it didn t have its security on alert, despite the attacks.The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was not able to confirm the number of casualties or the names or identities of the assailants.The three buildings used by the Iranian diplomatic mission are about five kilometers (3.1 miles) from the Iranian embassy, a police source said and described the attack as an act of terrorism. An Iranian Foreign Minister visited Iraq on Friday to meet with Iraqi President Hassan Rage s and Foreign Minister Abdul Mahdi. Iraqi and Iranian officials said that U.S. intervention in a Syrian campaign to remove Iranian forces from the country was to blame for the recent violence there and it was threatening the security of the region.

{"prompt":"Connecticut \u2019 s attorney general , and others investigating Equifax Inc \u2019 s ( EFX.N ) data breach , which affected some 143 million people , asked the company on Friday to disable links to","text":"Connecticut \u2019 s attorney general, and others investigating Equifax Inc \u2019 s ( EFX.N ) data breach, which affected some 143 million people, asked the company on Friday to disable links to phishing sites that exploited the flaw. \u201c If these links are not disabled, we expect to take further action against these websites, \u201d Assistant Attorney General John P. Kennedy wrote in the letter. Kennedy also wrote that Equifax will have to turn over the technical data it collected from victims of the breach, and that Equifax could potentially face civil charges if it didn\u2019t comply. In a statement Friday, the company said it had disabled the links to phishing sites in compliance with the letter and had shared the data request with public authorities. \u201c I want to remind everyone that there are risks of phishing attacks, even after an incident that is well over three months from now, \u201d Equifax CEO Erik Johnson said in a statement. \u201c Even after an incident like this, the criminals behind the phishing attacks are going to continue to try to lure some of the victims to click on the messages. It\u2019s a crime that was designed not to be caught. \u201d The company said it had hired the technical assistance of law firm Hogan Lovells in November, before the breach, and had hired the security and forensic team of Lockton, a law firm from the breach to help it investigate the loss of data. There were two major shortcomings in the customer authentication system at Equifax, which was vulnerable to hackers and malicious software, and the company let two thirds of its employees know about the flaw, although it is not clear how many took advantage of the vulnerability. However, even if some employees chose to click on the links without their employer\u2019s knowledge, they could have been able to get an access token, a secret file that is used by hackers to gain access to the target account. The company also disclosed at least one breach on its website in April, three months before the breach at Equifax, but it didn\u2019t have the technology back then to share such data with public authorities. Johnson told CNN \u201d We want to put the brinkmanship in brinkmanship to prevent a similar type of situation in the future \u201d. On Friday, Equifax announced it had hired a technology consulting firm, RedMonk Inc, to help it with its investigations, reports AP. Johnson said the company still faces risks from hackers and malware, but that the risk has fallen as customers have been better educated by Equifax about hackers\u2019 tactics.","token_len":524,"entropy":[10.4621,11.4553,8.55,8.5864,11.7081,1.2834,2.0967,3.4569,5.9158,7.7634,10.4534,0.0462,4.2556,8.8188,0.0874,3.6408,6.6682,8.2578,8.2692,3.8615,4.7564,0.7438,4.2746,0.2882,1.9362,2.7806,3.4709,3.8716,4.9876,0.5504,2.1871,1.7766,9.5265,1.1298,3.9857,3.6418,2.0055,0.36,7.3005,6.9107,0.2831,8.5706,0.0074,2.1737,2.1655,5.2108,0.9823,4.6685,1.1556,7.7153,5.7311,6.4092,4.7483,1.9721,0.9756,1.4483,2.9817,0.3386,5.2459,4.9884,2.1684,4.5863,3.3228,0.3932,2.4139,3.0677,2.5216,1.6913,7.2268,5.7764,9.7401,0.4644,0.0029,3.935,4.3082,0.1309,5.9445,3.1163,0.3711,3.1123,0.3914,0.9276,8.8838,1.7398,3.3685,0.29,0.5689,0.0001,2.8912,4.1033,0.6426,4.0856,0.9997,2.1125,5.923,1.3828,2.0397,2.1304,1.642,3.4858,1.2973,0.4898,1.3025,1.8105,1.8254,1.2412,1.6127,0.0004,3.6861,5.3755,1.9364,3.2679,3.5005,2.1024,0.4166,4.6328,9.8175,2.7569,1.9416,1.8686,0.7181,3.8779,1.6804,0.8639,3.3763,0.2106,2.1673,0.9469,0.2882,0.9423,2.0895,6.0883,1.3666,1.5876,1.7334,0.285,0.0415,0.1966,3.0168,6.3789,0.0129,0.7504,2.6232,2.2064,3.258,7.4066,1.2095,2.0622,7.3599,0.1591,6.5637,1.3881,0.5029,3.4715,0.909,7.08,3.538,0.272,4.0273,1.8518,0.4727,3.6722,1.1062,5.2684,3.7096,1.9423,0.001,3.5697,1.5981,4.2674,4.7682,4.0716,4.1862,4.4141,1.9754,4.3622,3.8061,4.0842,1.5613,5.5182,2.2106,1.5436,2.6469,1.5088,6.3072,0.0002,3.8231,7.3789,5.3549,0.5945,0.907,0.3781,0.278,0.411,2.0241,0.7928,5.3341,2.1871,1.3661,0.6033,2.1863,0.189,0.3483,2.754,7.3122,4.7423,1.9578,1.1768,0.0065,1.2849,2.0633,3.0552,0.0265,1.5341,0.4916,3.1799,0.6152,6.0274,6.9542,1.6094,1.9914,0.6326,1.6178,5.5793,0.3529,2.0778,8.308,1.4918,3.8411,5.9396,1.0311,0.1504,2.9205,5.6606,3.1398,5.536,4.4065,5.4969,0.5361,1.1924,4.4234,1.3949,2.0895,2.4353,2.2645,2.2851,2.9815,0.8123,2.4692,7.0519,3.2396,4.4958,2.9665,0.6483,2.8082,5.1877,4.9875,0.2094,0.0048,0.0692,3.5367,6.2283,1.9467,5.4453,1.3508,2.4409,2.3784,1.0387,3.1029,3.2307,1.824,3.7385,4.051,4.5087,2.1994,0.9125,9.2176,6.2083,1.8632,3.8581,2.2118,0.0157,6.2969,2.8942,11.8136,5.6808,1.2335,1.7281,3.819,1.2679,8.2449,0.4665,1.2546,0.3465,5.6124,1.6553,3.9567,4.982,7.4124,0.7537,0.3811,7.1211,5.648,1.2031,4.2715,0.3774,0.0,1.0532,2.5374,1.992,4.4051,0.2611,4.5013,2.7612,5.0721,1.8476,1.0435,2.2407,1.8882,1.3437,9.2241,6.4407,7.8536,0.0313,0.7568,4.041,3.9219,1.2936,0.4697,2.1273,2.2084,6.5992,1.5362,3.835,1.2078,0.6598,1.0325,0.2349,6.3903,2.0471,0.0654,0.7629,1.1184,0.4464,5.174,0.003,5.1508,1.6176,3.6679,2.254,6.1112,0.388,4.7729,0.1877,0.8243,3.1429,4.9283,3.1966,6.4571,7.1008,0.4053,0.1947,0.3038,0.1683,1.9714,1.8529,1.849,1.4605,3.9486,0.0029,3.4822,4.0828,4.2672,2.8648,2.0565,1.8196,5.6271,6.6835,1.0113,2.4197,1.4952,1.8,3.8156,0.1949,3.4894,0.2284,0.0968,2.3151,5.0828,3.1231,0.7198,1.7352,1.3197,2.5061,4.5523,5.6821,1.2728,0.905,3.4713,4.3299,1.0402,1.2726,2.2298,3.7642,1.0675,6.3199,0.4074,1.0761,0.6123,1.2176,5.8216,0.1751,0.0,1.0407,3.548,1.9273,2.5155,1.2815,0.3416,0.4748,4.8869,1.699,5.2277,7.8884,2.1424,1.6598,4.2629,4.229,2.1835,0.6838,3.3018,0.1577,0.3174,5.6564,3.7347,4.0934,7.2878,2.3309,5.3846,3.6939,0.2633,5.4603,2.3283,16.8639,3.5555,2.699,16.7782,0.0808,4.0236,3.077,2.886,2.098,3.4499,0.0045,4.0958,2.5182,0.1485,0.0084,3.6407,0.5505,6.4627,5.7118,1.2135,0.1157,0.76,0.0002,2.8643,1.5008,0.8838,4.3867,1.5616,5.3858,3.6268,0.1711,1.43,6.7108,6.763,0.1331,4.52,1.918,0.371,0.8247,0.7545,3.9491,1.3635,3.4322,2.5404,7.167,5.8323,0.4659,2.8574,0.7675,1.2469,0.6873,6.6564,5.105,4.9889,1.9428,3.4246,1.9724,2.6563,1.0176,0.8711,1.8209,1.665,5.4242,3.0221,4.3993,3.8402,5.5115,0.6486,1.897,3.8625,3.5155,5.3064,5.1139,0.0001,2.9162,7.288,7.6667,0.2853,10.1751,1.0985]}

The decision came after a meeting with the president, government officials and army commanders, according to a statement of the Presidential Office.\nBut even if that decision is reversed, it is clear to the experts that the Rohingya are suffering worse now because they are no longer allowed to leave the camps. They\u2019re essentially living like prisoners \u2014 with no access to jobs, housing or education and with little hope of being resettled outside the Bangladesh border. Many will have to remain here until the end of their journey through Myanmar is determined.\nAnd many have suffered horrific violence as a result of the decision to move them from their land. At least 28 were killed when anti-government protests broke out while fleeing their homes in August.\nMany Rohingya Muslims face persecution and discrimination, suffering from human rights violations that the national government blames on Islamist militias, known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA).\nThe group has been accused of having links to an affiliate of the banned Islamic State.\nMyanmar denies providing the Rohingya access to citizenship rights \u2014 something the government argues is the worst form of racism. However, Myanmar has given Rohingya from Myanmar\u2019s neighbouring countries citizenship under the Law on Citizenship (Amendment), which grants citizenship to Bangladeshis registered at the border crossings.\nHowever, Rohingya refugees have been pushed back on this measure. In April, Rohingya refugees from Indonesia\u2019s West Java province went on hunger strike before they were sent back to Bangladesh. They refused to return to their home countries, fearing they could then be imprisoned or even killed because of their identities.\nThe Rohingya have been left behind when Bangladesh moved to take in nearly 1.7 million Rohingya Muslims who fled violence in Myanmar. So, the government is putting in place a solution where no one will be left behind. But for the Rohingya, it leaves them open to persecution and discrimination. This is why the Arakan University in Rangoon, Burma (Myanmar), says the group can no longer be considered \u2018unregistered migrants\u2019 with \u2018status as migrants\u2019.\nThis is an open access project that was funded by the South African National Department of Science and Technology","token_len":524,"entropy":[6.1633,0.3857,10.5806,1.5486,3.7114,14.5306,0.3363,3.7324,3.7355,3.492,0.893,3.1822,3.0841,6.2463,3.6307,7.8117,0.0846,0.6863,3.6387,1.686,0.783,6.0711,0.0439,0.0038,3.5211,8.9965,1.8289,4.4972,0.5075,0.0007,1.7516,1.7506,4.4478,1.8015,0.5406,4.8115,0.8484,0.2573,2.6266,5.1629,2.8595,2.8086,0.0029,0.6826,4.9424,0.477,3.4606,0.0026,11.3247,0.0057,8.6689,6.1891,2.6243,3.2473,5.0931,0.3447,7.9136,1.978,2.9775,2.1058,4.8234,3.7955,4.3487,2.9692,4.0558,4.8427,0.0468,2.2002,4.933,4.5427,6.0518,0.5369,0.0012,9.371,3.5478,3.7401,2.3992,0.7002,2.3638,0.159,2.7505,4.6332,0.0461,0.3805,2.2355,4.6951,3.0909,1.173,1.7539,2.7073,1.4466,1.5006,4.6176,1.977,6.9449,1.3224,0.2842,4.9489,1.9218,2.3089,3.5739,0.0007,1.7003,2.3847,4.7963,0.6897,7.9566,1.295,0.5606,0.8597,13.5514,5.3346,2.4414,4.5561,4.9483,0.9641,4.403,0.3094,1.8618,1.9386,3.2767,3.7721,2.5584,7.3977,0.3297,1.1648,1.9491,1.6431,4.7413,5.0565,4.4172,3.992,1.8469,0.9121,3.4473,0.0069,2.0676,0.1669,2.7679,1.472,4.0012,0.9996,3.2114,16.969,9.6601,4.8224,7.493,2.5729,5.2091,5.7692,6.1517,4.048,0.8867,2.8389,0.0406,5.2287,0.8851,2.7686,0.7495,1.3818,3.3601,2.8071,2.27,1.5428,0.174,4.13,4.383,0.0002,0.0005,4.8959,1.4972,4.4922,2.5146,0.3442,4.3349,5.2725,2.9657,0.7546,5.0524,3.9368,3.0511,1.3502,2.603,0.0695,1.7582,6.2414,4.3379,1.9464,8.0863,7.714,0.6211,0.8665,4.5584,4.8061,3.4621,5.4394,5.0889,3.4962,3.3965,0.5125,0.0944,0.7604,0.9811,4.5079,2.0653,2.7668,1.8592,2.8462,1.8082,4.6446,1.0347,4.5255,0.2582,5.3251,3.4839,0.1459,3.0949,5.3748,0.0034,1.1895,3.3866,1.9747,0.0013,6.1237,5.8257,3.8255,1.0287,0.6596,3.7077,1.1875,1.5805,4.0775,1.1572,3.8436,4.9452,2.9902,1.8722,2.0274,2.8958,6.7318,1.2332,5.3719,0.2096,1.0347,3.2899,4.4126,7.1942,0.457,3.8836,0.1773,5.5848,4.2106,2.2213,7.1261,0.1305,0.8275,3.7247,0.02,0.0003,0.0109,0.0165,0.2693,1.318,0.2581,0.1938,0.6591,1.598,1.904,5.1053,1.353,1.2139,1.9348,0.1002,4.9381,1.2481,0.474,4.8428,5.5598,0.3619,0.9296,4.4,2.7746,0.2968,3.0024,1.3764,7.2204,0.0029,4.8297,5.9133,2.246,0.601,6.9428,0.023,5.9235,4.1852,4.9915,4.1659,1.5831,1.3146,4.1623,0.6244,2.9682,5.2107,1.2615,0.002,5.4358,1.4516,4.0329,0.0312,3.8783,1.3885,5.0338,3.4529,6.7784,2.1056,10.7399,0.6848,0.8728,3.2254,2.0637,3.1563,5.1222,1.3334,6.9129,0.4012,1.5635,3.7294,4.4451,0.3873,2.6491,0.8608,4.9973,1.2429,0.2406,7.0853,2.3312,6.8032,4.8065,1.353,2.2479,5.2584,1.07,0.6931,4.5812,0.0215,3.1135,2.8568,2.2563,1.2431,5.2347,0.8908,4.4026,5.0915,4.1394,2.6512,2.3905,3.0274,0.3251,2.697,2.3226,1.2496,5.8791,5.8742,0.1169,0.0751,5.6268,1.8448,1.0805,4.9617,1.5012,1.9991,0.0662,4.6482,2.018,0.5712,4.9236,1.3061,0.189,1.4419,0.7381,3.1827,5.2897,0.1515,2.4706,0.7938,1.0464,2.1761,1.133,1.4182,2.7328,1.5643,2.5624,7.012,0.5576,4.1087,2.2003,4.0451,1.1745,5.0143,0.7248,0.4826,6.1843,0.2013,0.5409,2.1569,2.0628,1.59,1.3165,4.7821,3.0244,4.2367,3.8708,4.9639,1.4196,3.6528,2.081,4.8106,2.3855,0.8173,2.8815,0.0207,0.8292,2.5383,3.502,1.4488,1.9625,0.448,0.5333,1.4879,6.4282,3.3696,2.2253,1.1893,1.9444,5.487,3.6125,0.1306,1.0147,6.1662,5.6143,6.1388,1.9291,2.0837,0.6673,3.567,0.2289,0.5649,3.234,3.8596,1.7363,0.4075,0.6808,1.9948,6.8077,0.8815,5.8957,0.0699,1.809,1.103,1.3863,0.6546,5.1187,0.9542,2.7596,1.3462,5.1447,0.0089,0.0007,11.4141,2.8989,3.3918,2.1994,0.0066,0.87,4.8461,5.3463,6.1838,1.1939,2.7519,5.2275,2.7287,4.7594,4.0517,1.76,0.0034,2.3755,2.381,14.7809,5.1413,6.0674,2.8003,4.116,0.9398,0.7867,4.6589,10.7883,0.4117,6.3489,2.7504,5.1103,2.538,0.1628,1.0322,0.4879,3.7713,1.139,3.5519,3.6628,7.2333,2.2241,2.2421,3.7636,4.5496,0.4315,0.6664,6.0374,2.7816,3.2783,8.0893,0.222,5.2945,0.3132,0.1391]}

The UN said earlier this month that Iran's spies had been trying to recruit the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia to work with them in \"black operations\" abroad, the Guardian reported. The Foreign Ministry of Iran condemned the verdict in a statement. \"It is unacceptable that the court acquitted the accused persons despite the fact that they received death threats from the Iranian regime from several months and up to the date of the trial,\" it said. \"The court verdict is an","token_len":525,"entropy":[6.9161,2.9378,1.5941,0.0105,9.4785,0.8662,4.7659,0.3024,1.8864,5.593,1.483,5.8135,3.5252,1.4335,2.4865,5.1522,0.0004,0.0633,0.0925,2.0494,0.3744,0.0064,4.3035,2.111,7.3225,1.758,0.5173,9.1015,0.5845,7.2377,1.5445,0.1479,0.4732,1.4017,0.1086,2.6019,0.3138,8.6856,0.0521,0.3054,2.0679,3.8584,5.052,0.5806,6.2986,0.7756,1.9156,6.0722,2.43,1.8987,0.2172,4.4572,0.0287,2.2512,2.887,0.3645,0.0014,3.2281,0.4329,0.0044,3.9592,0.0232,0.7494,4.0658,0.9917,2.2041,3.4844,4.4988,8.0853,0.2123,0.4542,0.8762,4.8485,2.9468,0.3048,8.9056,0.0002,1.5157,7.7938,5.1759,1.4497,3.5497,0.0011,1.2099,0.0534,4.5699,1.7726,5.1737,4.9199,5.8771,0.3321,4.3275,2.6621,2.2944,0.0005,0.0126,0.0539,3.07,5.3208,1.4552,1.2947,6.3941,6.4025,4.7408,2.0025,5.6219,6.9781,10.1131,14.76,0.5157,7.8943,7.2324,1.131,4.275,1.1973,5.3684,0.0403,1.7087,4.5413,6.3773,8.7771,4.3687,2.2939,2.0198,6.9393,3.3452,1.4609,9.7611,2.2006,2.1371,2.6538,2.6352,0.7611,3.1445,2.553,2.3581,0.1275,2.3902,0.5942,6.7712,7.0562,0.0263,0.2693,4.068,4.3102,8.6559,0.6859,1.9371,4.7925,7.0412,5.5127,0.469,10.5738,0.1448,0.0243,0.0752,0.0009,4.9523,1.4081,8.279,6.5013,5.6575,5.2901,7.6839,0.993,2.689,6.8403,0.0437,1.5018,0.6878,1.6043,6.4777,0.0073,0.0076,0.7153,2.7932,4.0427,0.0596,0.0427,3.0432,0.0636,0.2496,0.1654,0.3667,2.0597,5.9825,0.063,3.1483,0.7233,0.1913,2.0197,1.0798,2.6124,3.1267,2.0968,4.6762,0.7211,3.9716,1.7095,0.6638,1.4761,4.7264,0.2951,5.8801,0.0019,3.3252,5.8977,2.1455,9.3355,0.4838,0.9336,1.7178,0.3043,3.5067,5.3881,0.0652,0.5644,2.9526,1.0235,0.0081,0.4592,2.2851,1.5367,3.0492,1.2147,2.1659,2.9669,1.2569,0.0084,0.0016,0.9236,5.4565,1.6212,4.0321,2.7234,4.501,0.0772,2.1308,1.0519,3.4896,6.5315,0.5056,0.6927,3.5826,3.4717,1.635,2.3091,3.5637,2.2172,9.7972,3.3373,7.3064,0.1973,4.9539,2.7759,4.255,1.0272,2.2469,4.2507,0.2467,2.3419,3.6737,1.8653,2.899,1.7468,7.3825,0.0032,3.2715,3.4526,7.9936,1.3924,4.0777,4.3099,1.6828,3.1559,1.0532,0.6333,2.4532,3.8594,5.2944,1.6766,0.9557,1.4152,0.7016,4.3796,2.4565,4.2126,0.4188,0.6522,7.0666,2.5475,0.3226,1.8135,1.7884,3.8091,4.3988,0.1495,0.368,4.5939,0.021,0.7534,1.4257,3.8844,4.5048,1.9592,5.5855,1.1547,2.8122,1.5387,2.6584,1.5041,0.0046,0.3228,0.666,0.848,1.3902,3.6528,1.8493,1.5842,3.1584,2.0144,3.1491,0.2691,1.0202,4.7369,1.2671,0.758,0.5979,3.7973,1.334,7.1617,0.3057,0.1857,0.0179,3.0241,8.2671,0.5771,6.1069,4.0796,1.3666,4.3256,3.3786,0.9283,1.0106,3.3865,5.076,1.6317,2.8038,0.155,0.1913,1.4553,5.5977,0.5131,0.0015,1.6773,4.0019,0.5601,6.8931,1.3759,0.0805,5.0714,0.063,0.9459,3.5733,3.7375,2.4553,0.2085,0.7324,1.4099,0.7053,5.8717,2.3426,2.316,4.1148,0.1506,0.3523,1.9158,1.8624,4.4703,4.7758,5.9364,0.0033,1.6333,5.4375,5.9031,3.1039,5.7934,4.0787,8.5459,2.1211,3.818,0.2112,2.9046,0.829,3.7247,2.1947,3.0326,3.1275,4.4509,1.2462,5.9481,0.9681,3.3702,3.2078,2.3003,0.662,3.1667,6.0065,7.9568,7.1137,1.4498,6.9358,1.3529,5.5585,0.0184,3.6531,3.1873,1.7985,3.1512,3.4411,7.575,1.1964,1.0935,6.0621,3.3141,6.7624,1.2369,0.651,0.2656,3.6182,1.9031,5.2985,1.3327,2.0726,4.5934,0.0499,3.1267,4.5345,4.787,3.7467,1.745,1.6273,0.4995,0.5928,0.7919,0.4229,0.422,0.3154,0.5424,0.3965,4.1065,0.7992,0.7184,1.5733,3.2478,1.456,1.4719,1.1689,4.2965,5.7099,4.2191,0.6974,6.6509,2.388,3.9384,4.3997,0.3527,0.2463,1.1273,4.3349,2.1414,5.2803,1.2704,3.2461,0.228,1.0006,2.8585,0.4718,0.0665,1.1656,0.9361,2.8777,0.5141,3.2362,0.3991,1.2174,3.343,5.7887,1.8966,3.5432,5.4359,7.3069,1.583,1.1493,0.1079,1.1184,5.922,5.35,0.5435,2.0779,1.491,3.0135,1.7762,6.0875,5.0547,5.0383,6.3919,6.9331,0.2024,4.6566,3.2588,0.1162,1.2522,2.0298,0.6163,1.0449,0.0712,0.1613,1.6712,1.3361,2.3785,5.2529,1.919,2.5946]}

And if anyone is running to take our jobs out of the country \u2013 that is a huge problem \u2013 I will get her out,\u201d Trump told reporters.\nMcCaskill was widely expected to announce this week she would endorse Trump if his economic agenda comes to fruition, but she has yet to make the case for it. \u201cWe have millions of people who are losing their jobs and nobody in Congress is doing anything about it but we have some in Congress who are going on TV every night saying we have to raise taxes, we have got to raise taxes, but we\u2019re going to lower taxes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMount Rushmore is very tired of taxes. They have got to go.\u201d\nTrump also defended McCaskill\u2019s controversial decision last week to vote against a House Republican bill to require companies that invest heavily in the United Arab Emirates to disclose their tax payments.\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday declared a state of emergency at the southern border following a weekend of record-proportional migrant crossings, a move that would enable him to take unprecedented steps to halt the flow of migrants.\nMcCaskill, who voted against the legislation, has said her reasoning was based on the \u201cright to know\u201d principle, an understanding that companies should disclose information about their employees. However, critics say McCaskill has not shown any particular concern about companies, such as Microsoft, moving their headquarters out of California, a state that has a high number of Silicon Valley companies. She also voted against legislation to limit corporate tax breaks, which critics say favor big businesses at the expense of ordinary taxpayers.\nThe debate, which has caused a stir across Silicon Valley, comes as businesses say immigration has eroded many of the benefits of having American workers in the United States, such as cutting down workplace overhead costs and free tuition for American children in private schools.\nIf she does not run a campaign to reclaim voters\u2019 support, California would have its next senator from a Democratic Party state for the first time since 1996, although the 2018 presidential election will likely decide the outcome in a tight race between Trump and Democratic challenger, California Senator Kamala Harris. If Trump wins, his campaign would have a strong presence in the state he won with 60% of the vote in 2016, where he garnered about 40% of the vote in the November national election.","token_len":525,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.8114,1.8006,2.267,0.5607,10.1366,3.3835,5.0055,6.139,9.7475,0.6841,0.0004,0.0001,0.0,5.698,0.0545,0.6406,2.5638,0.5851,2.9194,0.0063,3.5421,2.9655,6.1347,2.5147,1.1106,14.2555,7.6699,7.4435,3.4375,8.1664,1.8678,0.8787,2.2586,2.8347,2.1612,6.4526,2.1222,4.2948,2.7938,2.6398,2.4906,1.6765,3.2774,0.0456,1.8636,4.6566,5.1133,3.1066,1.7479,1.646,4.5153,1.7807,3.2234,2.4692,1.6639,4.5227,4.149,1.4152,3.2013,11.1748,8.8324,3.7261,2.2637,1.4096,1.4481,1.1383,22.1401,0.0013,0.0009,2.978,5.7969,1.1439,0.0108,3.4363,5.8004,0.3758,1.7473,0.9939,5.3125,0.4988,3.4828,3.897,4.5154,1.7982,3.926,0.6882,0.2874,1.7091,1.0812,2.3816,1.5744,2.2593,0.0026,2.0284,3.2311,2.8858,1.5939,2.1749,0.3164,6.3796,0.6161,6.5228,2.157,6.8343,0.1846,1.086,1.3071,1.1085,4.8023,0.3202,0.2002,1.5819,7.4907,4.4606,3.3111,1.1144,2.3345,0.5426,0.4609,0.1432,6.5877,4.0609,1.3963,5.2868,6.4308,2.2843,0.7016,0.4444,2.9878,5.8569,4.4482,6.0353,2.6127,1.1529,2.3758,1.8834,0.3694,2.4325,0.152,2.1738,1.6967,0.1589,5.1616,0.0788,2.7308,0.4392,1.2249,3.9767,1.0553,16.2465,9.5819,2.9575,1.6516,0.0808,4.4923,0.6595,1.897,3.4573,0.8608,2.1495,0.7188,0.6939,2.9596,0.3311,14.7527,3.2443,0.0005,1.5907,5.3288,6.1675,0.5575,4.9393,0.9928,2.8602,2.3657,3.6096,0.3124,2.172,1.0884,2.1943,1.3405,1.1562,2.3132,2.1195,4.6246,1.4959,0.0004,0.0014,6.5282,2.616,1.8838,5.4193,3.2914,4.6129,0.9195,0.1219,3.2599,0.5964,1.5502,3.8422,3.2194,1.4732,0.9182,5.7846,4.003,2.1641,6.0429,4.865,0.0309,3.0563,4.9502,10.7993,0.0008,0.2085,1.5332,1.2463,2.1197,5.0736,0.7457,1.0635,7.3409,0.0463,0.0047,0.0073,2.4296,0.0346,0.0138,2.7663,6.331,5.0502,2.5179,0.6902,0.0256,0.1339,5.7835,0.7372,6.2842,1.4553,4.6277,1.3162,3.8561,0.4406,8.7612,1.5569,12.8349,3.7435,0.1254,6.7004,4.2808,2.0727,3.2907,1.7709,0.5728,3.348,6.7355,2.5072,0.0476,3.9639,6.8064,2.0803,0.2149,4.3074,0.8739,0.3627,0.0671,1.8689,1.7663,1.1146,3.7603,0.004,0.0013,1.5415,1.1007,3.7044,0.7654,0.5865,3.1525,0.884,2.1836,2.2782,3.211,7.7694,1.2786,2.1567,0.1105,1.9748,14.6334,2.5426,5.1046,1.3713,4.9465,0.405,1.0901,11.9123,1.6655,4.5058,4.4297,0.518,4.6081,1.8323,1.6881,4.1778,0.8586,0.6125,4.7209,2.7492,4.4132,0.0259,6.2235,1.4218,4.3753,0.0005,0.0019,2.3759,2.8621,3.6283,2.1719,7.5693,3.6977,0.9683,6.8837,4.7813,3.0326,0.0032,5.7272,0.6595,9.2483,2.0765,2.1094,2.4749,0.0125,6.3283,2.0786,4.069,1.0929,0.9723,1.0137,2.0547,2.5681,2.5657,0.0023,6.1479,0.0005,1.4808,0.8643,5.1332,1.7101,2.7612,0.4003,3.457,1.5675,4.5901,4.5837,0.8222,0.7603,2.9112,1.7476,5.2005,0.3346,7.7284,3.0641,3.0272,4.9169,0.1898,0.024,0.0034,3.6252,4.3004,0.161,0.3033,2.6543,6.6632,5.2989,0.8493,1.6604,5.5632,2.4938,2.5724,2.8711,5.0676,0.001,0.3089,3.4152,0.9733,6.9021,4.7793,6.1449,2.2173,6.0112,6.0429,0.68,1.3404,2.869,1.3945,4.6227,3.3025,0.3925,2.0924,0.3965,0.601,0.0053,1.9155,3.3796,0.0057,6.7432,2.9782,9.2392,6.6102,1.8969,1.0386,6.6707,3.1028,1.7367,4.3259,2.9859,4.4405,3.9663,0.8549,0.139,0.6289,6.2626,2.6447,0.8529,0.92,3.5321,7.5029,2.8507,2.0669,6.8301,5.78,10.8896,1.5105,7.6248,1.8319,6.3177,2.5261,2.5491,5.2023,5.3332,3.5215,3.8546,1.4775,2.7144,3.5721,4.4922,5.9621,1.4957,1.3633,0.0043,1.2888,3.6538,0.9181,6.1263,2.5553,5.8513,4.0991,0.9539,2.3865,2.7558,3.9981,1.6439,2.7136,3.4625,1.9874,3.4678,0.3271,1.5374,2.7881,0.1609,1.3428,1.9566,4.6838,3.5024,2.2998,2.4277,0.0,0.0173,0.2375,4.9385,2.6467,1.1254,0.8032,3.6864,2.9031,1.2138,2.0326,2.4908,3.5357,2.4735,0.2043,0.9655,0.5607,7.2436,3.1896,4.6065,5.5674,1.6152,0.0512,0.1301,0.1573,0.9338,2.1163,1.3718,4.3564,1.0288,4.3759,3.7573,3.1113,0.1802,0.1343,0.0672,0.2457,1.9024,1.0498,3.7829,6.977,0.9172,0.1446]}

{"prompt":"The European Union wants a transition period after Brexit to end no later than the last day of 2020 , according to the European Commission s negotiating directives agreed on Wednesday . That date ,","text":"The European Union wants a transition period after Brexit to end no later than the last day of 2020, according to the European Commission s negotiating directives agreed on Wednesday. That date, they noted, is a matter for Britain to agree to. Britain, in turn, had agreed in September that it wanted to see the end of that transition by 31 December. UK Prime Minister Theresa May and EU leaders on Tuesday said they might need a new post-Brexit trade deal. Mr. Juncker\u2019s directive says the Commission must have a deal in place that must be agreed on with the UK no later than the first day of January 2021. If the final terms were not agreed on by that date, both parties would automatically give automatic right of passage to the next post-Brexit agreement, starting with the agreement for the UK-EU Association. The directive says that if the last date agreed on by both parties on the final trade deal would not allow for a UK-EU trade agreement on 1 January 2021, the Commission must consider measures to ensure its full implementation on 1 January 2021. Britain has also said the European Commission must get to an agreement with Britain on the Northern Ireland protocol by the end of this month in order to prevent the United Kingdom from going back to the Withdrawal Agreement. In addition to the directive on the last day of October 2020, Mr. Juncker also issued a directive saying that it must be possible to reach an agreement on how each party would implement its Withdrawal Agreement by 2 December.\nOn a day when there are so many celebrations in the capital, Delhi government issued an advisory stating that no religious celebration be indulged with loud music or with a view to inconvenience others.

Charles Grassley, a Republican representing Iowa and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said that McCain should be able to make his voice heard in the Senate with votes.\n\u201cSenator McCain is going to be making his return to our floor in a few more days,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cWe have a great opportunity to have a hearing on the tax plan, to have people speak out about this proposal. I hope he will be able to participate there.\n\u201cI think that with Senator McCain is returning, that\u2019s where we will be able to have a real discussion, because it\u2019s very difficult for a senior member of the Senate to not be present to support things that are important to our country.\u201d\n\u201cIf the president was able to have that discussion, I think that he would see a lot of changes to the tax plan,\u201d Grassley said.\nThe Republican Senate bill provides an exemption to taxpayers making up to $200,000 a year from paying the new standard. The same exemption is also offered in the current tax bill.\nThe Democratic Republican tax bill repeals the tax on capital gains and would increase the deductibility of charitable contributions, allowing individuals to give up to $4,100 in 2015 and up to $6,000 per year starting in 2018.\nTax experts and economists have warned that the Democratic Republican tax bill will only further aggravate a recession by making it more difficult for households to save and invest, as well as increasing the burden of state and local taxes.\nThe Republican tax bill would cut taxes on the richest American households, and also has a provision to give a $1.5 trillion cut in tax breaks to the richest people, but would reduce the overall tax cuts in the tax law passed in 2012.\nRepublicans and Republicans say the tax cut measure passed in the 2012 election was not bipartisan, but rather a Republican compromise.\nBut there was bipartisanship in the Republican tax cut measure that passed in 2009, which includes a provision for the families of military and police members.","token_len":525,"entropy":[8.6604,2.9288,0.2871,1.7525,1.3879,1.7301,7.8041,5.6006,0.4669,3.382,0.2847,2.6923,2.1738,7.2443,6.3373,4.071,1.5707,0.6615,3.7099,1.5779,5.4151,4.5967,0.4369,1.4727,3.3785,0.9012,1.2278,5.1942,8.2339,1.7402,1.9355,7.9551,5.3107,0.0,0.6978,1.768,3.3047,0.9438,0.4503,0.5458,0.5786,2.0176,0.4313,17.9514,8.6436,7.3761,6.9236,0.6736,4.7379,0.6896,0.8608,2.8967,2.12,2.7566,5.0933,1.5431,6.4083,2.13,1.7608,4.6242,1.642,5.8061,3.8847,1.4012,0.8025,1.2724,5.0534,5.0497,5.631,1.3959,4.8059,5.037,4.3447,5.7143,0.8162,4.8049,3.2529,6.305,3.5844,0.5077,1.2851,5.9889,2.0478,2.6529,2.497,1.7835,5.1083,6.7568,2.5628,3.0312,6.6802,1.4732,0.3583,2.0437,2.316,0.8529,2.1218,10.4564,6.9477,2.3637,0.0012,0.3251,0.2344,0.3597,6.7505,0.1109,4.8886,1.0461,0.5443,2.7076,0.5535,5.978,0.542,2.1464,7.6463,0.019,0.013,1.2815,0.0279,0.0974,0.7072,2.6505,2.668,2.8886,1.43,1.7028,0.0153,3.7456,1.5251,2.9026,0.0194,1.715,0.7638,0.8069,4.9336,5.0398,1.9837,0.3486,1.0917,0.5764,3.8647,3.8701,2.1926,4.4475,0.1195,0.8196,4.7397,0.977,6.2554,0.2507,6.3319,5.1267,2.7417,1.5998,1.7547,4.6833,0.6983,1.1499,1.7273,1.1952,0.2936,0.1611,0.2752,5.2858,0.3065,2.6661,2.7381,1.6514,3.2229,1.1321,0.6866,2.9674,1.8481,4.3757,1.5629,1.5268,1.0002,2.7802,1.7799,4.041,1.327,4.637,5.0323,0.8899,2.1817,3.0291,5.5213,2.4109,3.0217,2.619,2.0627,1.2842,1.6044,0.4584,0.0132,3.5972,6.1505,1.46,1.2951,0.3925,0.0587,2.8706,1.5813,2.1456,5.471,2.4352,0.1954,6.8762,9.9926,4.2719,3.1489,12.1943,9.648,4.5646,4.7781,1.333,3.7184,1.0771,1.9478,0.0173,2.3181,0.715,3.2284,2.2808,2.6809,3.5461,2.7155,3.022,0.4512,0.0124,3.3368,2.8955,1.6134,2.0693,6.3682,2.0789,0.3099,0.9124,0.7728,0.3404,4.1761,1.2689,3.9553,3.3218,3.2396,5.7443,0.8484,1.3252,2.1691,0.559,2.454,0.4768,0.9607,2.4047,2.7263,0.54,0.4917,0.0861,3.1665,3.2968,2.6089,4.448,2.3933,0.0299,4.0219,2.5235,2.5756,1.021,2.1203,0.5894,1.3777,2.6363,0.7055,5.5058,2.6486,1.7018,0.3488,6.4449,1.8358,0.9414,1.1621,1.3886,1.2783,1.8747,0.4234,1.7857,0.0956,0.0896,0.4368,4.4029,3.2176,4.0167,6.2711,5.9639,3.3111,3.7017,2.7526,6.87,3.6793,2.3699,0.4705,0.173,3.228,0.0498,0.0074,1.3467,0.0011,3.4225,2.83,2.5862,6.0201,4.0386,3.4301,1.5987,5.8306,2.3881,2.5188,2.5123,3.2789,3.6818,1.4368,3.0708,1.3301,1.6623,1.05,0.6497,2.6683,7.1238,5.9995,2.2917,0.5048,4.7091,0.0036,0.5496,1.9436,2.5247,2.2887,0.0089,1.3538,8.0058,3.4628,0.5345,6.6347,0.0196,0.27,3.7464,0.3421,2.2883,4.6549,2.5853,0.5752,4.144,1.4294,0.047,0.1922,4.1169,0.2588,3.9288,1.6231,7.2648,1.9667,2.4218,0.0067,0.0226,2.539,0.0005,1.3608,6.0262,0.1724,5.4316,0.2311,1.6494,0.2749,0.5726,6.7537,3.4185,3.0624,3.9053,1.294,2.9993,0.3653,1.2176,6.6212,5.8773,0.5359,0.6326,2.31,5.4451,4.4982,5.1801,0.0019,3.5049,4.1225,3.3372,2.8875,0.7336,1.6666,0.1519,0.1909,4.7018,0.3438,2.0655,2.3921,0.902,2.0631,3.2851,0.7223,0.0067,3.5157,0.6867,3.1423,0.8963,3.5342,0.2071,0.1198,0.3717,0.9419,0.3684,2.0794,2.7028,1.0468,0.5,1.5058,3.7914,1.5242,1.0664,1.756,3.4298,5.6651,1.5213,1.9027,2.5351,3.6692,6.9418,2.2381,2.6136,1.5925,4.0347,3.1598,3.4364,1.4757,2.1496,1.3693,0.4324,3.2491,1.5714,2.7262,1.7874,0.5732,1.672,2.5585,4.215,1.8582,3.5519,2.1387,3.867,0.9202,3.9621,1.297,4.442,3.9517,0.6883,2.71,7.2345,6.8286,1.468,2.9861,0.8859,0.4297,3.4816,3.764,4.9145,4.7051,1.0906,2.0134,2.9445,6.3562,5.9199,2.7184,1.799,3.7316,1.3166,1.8205,3.1411,5.9231,1.2771,1.8225,4.4258,1.3837,4.2,3.6619,2.1734,0.785,4.1982,4.2459,2.8157,9.1859,0.0005,0.0,0.0001,1.2014,0.3262,2.8598,0.9674,5.02,3.0352,2.3935,6.1114,1.5786,6.1525,1.0511,2.8714,4.7319,1.2251,1.5804,3.4197,1.8648,8.1672,0.7594,5.8985,3.1902,4.1141,3.1914,1.8668]}

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank , breaking with precedent by denying Janet Yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her","text":"President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank, breaking with precedent by denying Janet Yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her approach to policy. \u201cGovernor Powell knows just the right combination of the right attitude, the right vision and the right knowledge to handle the job,\u201d Trump said in a television address.\nIt is unlikely the appointment of Powell, a long-time friend of Trump and the most powerful man on the Federal Reserve Board, will be taken as a formal endorsement because there will be two other vacancies on what is referred to as the FOMC, the policy making body.\nPowell was a longtime advocate of expansionary monetary policy, while Yellen, an ally of President Barack Obama and one of Trump\u2019s top economic advisers, insisted on the central bank\u2019s role in reducing inflation.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way I want to play it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a good feeling about Jerome Powell. It\u2019s going to work out great for our country.\u201d\nOn Thursday, in an effort to calm fears that a president\u2019s influence would cloud monetary policy, a spokesperson for the Federal Reserve said that \u201cgovernor-elect Joe Biden has the ability to appoint officials to replace those elected officials.\u201d\nThe Trump White House has said that Yellen would run the central bank even if Powell were not voted in. She is serving his first term as chairman.\nThe two candidates have been in competition for years. Yellen, once Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, had little respect for Mr. Trump\u2019s position and was critical of Wall St.\u2019s actions in the past year.\nIn a series of tweets, Trump said he was confident Yellen would succeed with the job. \u201cI\u2019ve always had confidence in Yellen and all the rest, and I still do,\u201d he said.\nPresident Trump on Thursday said he had decided on Fed Governor Jerome Powell as a replacement for Janet Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve.\nTrump\u2019s choice has provoked criticism from several prominent Fed watchers, including former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, and from other prominent Republicans, including Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wash., who wrote that Trump\u2019s decision \u201cdemonstrates once again that he doesn\u2019t have a single good idea in his entire presidency, let alone a single good plan to fix our economy.\u201d","token_len":527,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,3.1139,2.2445,8.3563,9.6014,3.9994,0.8829,0.0147,0.5043,3.3821,2.5114,0.0014,0.1413,2.2422,0.0001,0.0008,0.0045,1.0212,0.0067,1.6558,7.0441,0.8637,5.0848,3.8276,9.017,7.4884,0.0041,0.0,2.2511,3.2578,0.0641,7.0113,4.6701,2.074,5.9763,0.0562,2.3537,7.5032,0.4084,3.9857,0.7801,14.4546,5.9101,9.8964,0.0144,0.0604,8.6749,6.0024,4.1242,1.1926,5.0137,0.1824,5.5249,4.3966,6.1252,1.8278,1.8174,0.2739,5.238,0.9381,0.2541,0.1755,5.8582,0.9991,3.7783,0.9744,2.6399,2.8196,10.6431,7.6089,5.6293,0.7815,1.4363,0.6247,5.7362,3.595,0.6819,1.1106,15.2464,1.8492,5.2321,2.9767,4.5415,1.351,0.3347,2.332,1.5637,4.9904,0.0977,0.1268,3.7514,0.525,2.1495,1.6994,2.5804,5.6931,2.7388,1.606,2.8755,1.0973,4.9226,0.0069,2.1284,0.1566,0.6181,1.9747,4.4802,3.1855,0.5422,5.2977,2.8012,7.0544,4.395,3.9237,0.2441,5.5054,3.0435,4.2795,1.3893,8.4506,1.5231,7.235,0.0032,0.2854,0.3987,5.3004,0.8228,0.0003,3.201,2.0718,6.6501,6.6839,0.51,1.514,1.0939,1.1614,0.0007,2.489,2.8443,3.0007,2.9888,0.4091,6.6589,1.6733,0.1239,0.0875,1.3258,5.1305,2.3013,0.0,1.6747,3.6093,3.8651,0.1994,3.5602,0.8059,0.002,2.2676,3.4529,0.0523,2.4244,12.6777,7.6164,0.0894,2.2867,1.1353,0.1865,0.123,8.356,2.1435,2.761,3.4513,0.0922,11.4408,2.5573,0.4436,1.2824,0.7942,5.8687,1.8198,1.0664,0.6498,6.0207,0.9652,5.3281,7.3083,1.2778,0.6142,2.4313,2.268,2.3217,5.488,2.0748,0.4862,3.6528,2.5184,1.8569,1.9859,2.5004,2.0274,0.4645,0.842,3.7325,0.2664,1.1594,4.6997,2.2566,3.8921,1.958,2.3988,3.5901,3.6119,1.1385,8.7055,0.3337,1.5261,3.6922,1.5603,0.6244,0.0081,2.0072,0.0249,5.0307,1.4216,2.1076,1.9859,4.0095,1.165,0.7035,2.5631,2.8671,1.1347,4.9836,1.4277,0.2274,5.7486,1.7552,4.3547,0.0215,4.4386,3.1175,1.5635,3.3752,5.376,6.2182,0.4737,0.0445,6.911,2.4191,7.7928,4.5269,0.0245,0.3255,4.4851,5.2727,0.0921,1.3756,2.0537,0.615,1.2197,2.1069,7.5529,0.2524,8.0981,0.1968,6.9742,1.6543,8.027,2.5457,2.4051,4.5123,4.0892,0.227,2.3679,5.6727,1.4744,4.592,6.3758,5.2708,3.9248,0.9929,4.3723,1.9765,0.5409,2.0006,4.4762,4.0956,0.0014,1.5775,2.7424,0.8633,4.8231,0.0002,2.2483,4.9791,0.3268,2.3526,0.0192,4.5865,1.256,1.2689,1.301,2.0606,7.7547,0.6429,0.6591,5.0425,1.7735,5.6799,5.3383,2.3851,0.0745,1.2048,3.3908,2.708,0.439,1.8816,4.6409,4.2582,1.9445,1.9749,2.5523,5.9588,0.533,4.2993,1.7675,2.5025,0.0007,1.8911,5.1624,5.5643,2.0658,0.2149,0.0401,2.5559,0.6267,0.1354,0.1595,3.8951,5.7173,7.1656,0.0436,5.5315,0.1043,0.341,1.9282,0.1557,0.0059,4.9498,2.0494,2.3038,4.0224,0.0555,6.2234,7.3745,0.2707,4.3624,0.7965,0.0276,3.3477,1.3383,0.9962,4.757,3.7579,0.8152,0.9806,2.8753,2.1279,3.82,0.0037,0.7606,1.2984,2.1476,1.5091,1.628,1.8699,4.1135,2.9713,0.0006,0.2641,2.9024,5.2274,1.31,1.8657,0.9849,3.9045,0.0676,3.1037,3.6658,0.7102,1.5276,4.6799,3.7246,1.5892,0.3976,4.3062,0.001,2.4923,5.1239,1.5435,5.2762,3.2824,1.6088,0.947,6.5055,2.5714,2.0438,2.1423,2.1399,0.9006,0.4476,0.253,0.4489,5.8796,1.6262,2.5898,0.5809,2.3635,0.8667,2.2144,3.9101,2.692,4.0935,1.0741,0.2219,0.003,1.5519,2.4312,1.3169,0.093,1.6748,0.0029,0.0001,3.5576,3.3711,0.2901,0.0199,1.274,0.1164,0.596,1.5638,3.8468,2.218,0.1325,0.0584,2.3717,3.8361,6.3684,2.5212,0.541,4.3202,3.4339,2.9359,2.4634,0.0033,1.1331,0.7384,1.5403,1.1839,1.6781,0.5875,0.0303,0.0,0.9683,3.0923,1.7294,3.6205,2.4652,2.9763,1.2744,0.7112,2.5816,0.0064,3.5619,0.5172,1.1897,0.2819,0.0105,0.0443,9.9676,0.4231,1.1434,4.9275,1.9898,4.0369,2.4223,0.0337,0.0034,2.7086,6.8749,0.832,8.8036,0.0382,0.5165,8.6758,0.0622,0.4907,1.3903,4.2692,0.9126,0.7236,0.1084,2.0008,1.9368,5.8915,4.2562,2.329,3.6328,1.5479,6.6126,2.7855,3.2644,4.7845,0.0003,1.5655,3.5153,2.3571,1.9098,2.2893,3.1164,4.0793,2.4957,0.1767,3.7054,1.0697]}

She took part in an agreement with two other expatriate agents who had worked with her and a Palestinian.\nShe could have been jailed for up to 15 years but the maximum penalty was lowered after the court also found her guilty of \u201cinsulting the feelings of the Egyptian community\u201d.\nA source who was involved in the negotiations, who did not want to be named, told Britain\u2019s Daily Express newspaper that the case represented a \u201csacred mission\u201d for the family of an Egyptian who was jailed for 18 months in 2010.\nHis wife was jailed earlier this year for smuggling narcotics and then freed in November with a seven-year probation order only to go on to be jailed again earlier this month.\nShe had asked her lawyers to appeal against her sentence to avoid a further prison term, the source said.\nShe was tried together with a Palestinian woman and a Bangladeshi man believed to be her boyfriend. Egypt has a strict drug law, only allowing the sale of controlled substances to registered pharmacies and under the supervision of pharmacists.\nThe drug dealings of Egyptian expatriates to send narcotic substances into Egypt has increased over the last year.\nAt least 18 Egyptian citizens have been captured while attempting to smuggle drugs into the country, while almost 100 pounds of cocaine, heroin, and other controlled substances have been seized from Egyptian expatriates and Egyptian drug couriers in the past year.\nThe drug smuggling is linked in part to the Egyptian military-backed uprising in 2011.","token_len":528,"entropy":[10.3991,2.8153,2.1042,1.6773,5.407,3.2502,0.359,2.8787,0.231,0.3367,0.3335,1.4139,1.8465,0.4071,5.2066,5.3475,3.6348,11.797,3.496,1.2953,1.3703,1.3338,0.682,1.8495,3.5592,1.7327,6.072,7.1789,5.4067,0.8801,0.8677,6.5786,3.156,1.7918,3.8402,0.7261,3.016,1.2319,0.4032,0.3751,0.2489,14.8189,2.9955,6.903,3.3566,0.9716,2.9164,0.907,0.7765,10.6639,1.7595,1.0733,0.0004,4.754,6.0669,3.3022,5.8632,4.7257,15.5318,8.2674,2.8884,2.4972,3.7852,5.8578,2.5564,4.6265,5.7623,2.4331,3.1254,0.595,0.3717,1.7641,6.001,3.0598,0.6142,5.7633,5.11,3.1817,1.9374,2.0178,6.6964,0.1177,0.0228,2.4214,5.0998,3.4936,3.7561,2.0071,0.234,0.4397,0.5294,0.9126,4.3082,4.1895,2.0813,0.3249,0.2538,4.5484,0.8542,3.6739,5.1799,4.7615,3.9007,3.7579,0.3607,2.0015,4.9798,1.4836,6.3046,1.9951,0.5156,5.8543,0.33,2.0979,2.5554,3.8944,5.9668,3.5869,1.68,4.6358,0.0181,1.7447,5.4348,0.8783,3.4672,1.6096,1.8516,0.0104,0.0796,7.5498,0.6136,0.4745,2.4418,2.6421,1.7058,3.2947,1.2056,4.5762,0.0786,6.7496,5.3374,1.0432,2.202,2.1201,1.8731,2.0928,2.8149,0.061,4.8097,2.6683,2.1661,0.1175,8.6994,2.6898,3.8298,1.0265,0.6066,0.2067,0.1425,5.4614,4.7572,3.6661,1.3584,1.3395,2.4974,0.5712,0.182,1.1792,4.5358,1.1046,1.116,4.4888,2.8034,6.0595,1.2292,1.1152,3.639,1.1965,4.8609,5.7507,1.1481,4.8591,8.8904,3.1962,6.1084,2.5751,4.1814,1.3554,4.5898,2.3755,2.5158,6.4951,6.2754,0.5232,0.242,1.0183,3.2702,0.8008,1.0086,5.6263,6.0081,3.1487,3.3508,0.719,5.6617,2.9612,3.2615,0.9495,1.1204,2.4293,3.0142,0.0313,13.3782,5.523,6.4459,4.9871,0.577,10.5256,2.4453,4.5995,6.2775,3.7417,0.029,2.9365,5.4931,0.974,4.9262,2.1573,7.6066,1.0866,1.2977,2.6296,1.8132,1.8958,3.6075,1.9809,0.2758,2.9714,4.7564,7.4138,3.3914,0.2341,2.377,5.253,1.82,1.3492,3.7219,0.1838,0.7863,0.0011,3.7586,0.0373,2.742,1.538,6.4046,1.7598,0.9231,8.6068,3.7527,1.0305,1.29,6.5785,1.8597,1.9885,0.5178,0.17,10.5335,0.1216,4.7839,0.3294,0.0677,0.9889,6.2555,0.0903,1.4308,5.0723,3.7863,4.355,9.1109,0.682,0.2403,3.5542,4.6368,4.2369,1.6145,2.0739,0.1045,0.3826,3.8867,4.1692,1.2193,2.1805,0.0012,0.4136,0.0256,0.0428,0.1163,0.2066,2.1184,7.9345,12.2584,0.1388,0.0134,3.2689,3.2674,2.4018,0.4849,0.6477,2.4336,4.9298,0.7262,14.3756,0.6889,9.0453,0.5391,5.5456,0.173,0.6475,2.9945,0.7964,3.9965,1.1376,2.3714,0.8257,2.4792,1.6238,3.7917,0.801,5.1126,0.604,1.7012,3.6978,1.4344,0.215,6.9749,2.2391,1.8907,3.4334,6.6471,0.2348,0.3234,0.7459,3.0924,5.6811,2.8136,6.261,6.5909,1.6552,3.4703,5.4613,1.5307,6.62,0.0521,0.5585,5.5485,3.2166,8.0208,1.3097,4.7358,1.0036,1.1344,2.2023,2.6899,0.6496,5.4344,0.0297,2.2526,0.6427,0.4153,3.0434,1.7104,5.5646,2.9454,2.6431,0.3523,2.5442,2.6598,1.7035,1.2882,2.8368,4.3567,2.0181,4.4268,3.6696,0.4966,2.2759,2.1779,0.2462,0.2026,0.1966,0.3731,2.7887,1.688,5.8192,6.8065,0.0389,2.5496,2.0896,3.5874,1.338,1.696,4.7438,0.0062,0.0,0.7895,8.1452,0.019,0.2996,2.2733,3.3653,1.4364,6.0107,1.87,2.1464,2.7949,3.6414,2.0093,2.0018,7.8282,1.0319,2.3369,2.3816,0.4044,3.7764,0.1164,1.8259,6.7246,5.5215,1.9477,5.7906,1.5656,2.6162,0.0067,7.6883,0.0178,0.3401,0.3852,1.3954,6.1413,8.6736,4.0684,2.6566,4.2162,0.0564,0.0957,5.7279,9.581,9.6556,0.0103,3.393,1.4909,3.1653,5.1744,3.6683,3.0937,0.0786,1.4549,2.2878,1.679,0.7872,5.7799,0.3827,4.4775,2.5962,2.7585,0.9049,0.4819,6.5432,4.8491,2.8161,0.0386,0.9985,0.0004,0.7738,0.422,0.6005,0.3052,1.6988,4.3656,5.2275,2.9962,7.997,0.3205,1.4928,1.772,1.445,1.1229,1.9896,2.2215,3.9143,0.0852,0.7105,0.3609,0.7339,2.6691,2.5025,6.1286,0.0149,0.1953,3.3644,6.1899,6.5337,7.5393,0.0001,1.6642,0.9891,0.4686,1.2487,0.3972,0.6683,1.8293,5.8282,2.1,2.8338,5.3034,5.4568,0.5336,0.0541,1.0478,3.5853,2.8193,3.6785,0.6884,3.0517,1.2448,0.8387,2.3891]}
{"prompt":"The U.S. Congress on Thursday averted a government shutdown just one day before federal funding was due to expire , sending President Donald Trump a bill to provide just enough money to keep agencies operating","text":"The U.S. Congress on Thursday averted a government shutdown just one day before federal funding was due to expire, sending President Donald Trump a bill to provide just enough money to keep agencies operating.\nThe legislation, passed by a vote of 223 to 195, would block the government shut down for a single day and avoid a prolonged crisis that would have created havoc for the federal government and its millions of employees, many of whom were due to lose their jobs if the government closed for a week.\nThe Republican Congressional leaders, citing the current climate of uncertainty regarding the country\u2019s finances and foreign policy, reached through the midnight deadline and passed a temporary funding bill for one day late Thursday.\nThis weekend, the House and Senate should be voting on legislation to pass to avoid a government shutdown and provide a full year of government funding, which expires at midnight in late October.\n\"This decision is a temporary fix that was reached at midnight and will give the president a fighting chance to get a better trade deal,\u201d Senator Roy Blunt, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee said in a statement.\nThe House will vote on a proposal to fund the government until October 31. The Senate will vote on a budget amendment that funds the government until the end of 2019.\nThere are still some unanswered details about the Trump administration\u2019s plan to reopen the federal government after the holidays, but the general idea is that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was on Thursday in talks with House Republicans to fix the budget, would sign the \u201cphase one\u201d budget and a trade bill that will keep the government closed until Jan. 3.\nThe agreement would then be subject to President Donald Trump\u2019s signature, which if he cannot manage, could force lawmakers to vote quickly on Sunday on a budget amendment that would fund the government until October 31.\nMnuchin was in Washington on Thursday speaking at three places: Treasury, at the Capitol and at the White House, where he received a copy of the proposed budget resolution. The president and lawmakers are scheduled to meet Friday afternoon to try to resolve their differences, with the Senate expected to vote on a temporary spending bill later that afternoon and House Republicans saying they would be ready to discuss a tax-cut compromise.\nMnuchin\u2019s strategy has been clear: to save precious time by moving forward with the one-year funding bill until the government shutdown ends on December 22. Trump agreed to move forward after his attorney general issued a report saying that legal arguments that prevented the government\u2019s shut down over the Christmas holidays had been resolved.","token_len":528,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.1615,4.3835,1.7305,9.924,0.2459,0.6046,2.8318,0.0254,6.385,4.3317,0.4098,1.917,5.6263,2.6524,2.2359,1.5034,0.269,0.4769,1.4223,4.301,3.2658,1.3072,0.0075,3.5274,5.2297,0.744,4.2603,7.2351,3.4872,0.8893,0.5471,1.42,7.8989,2.0538,0.8743,0.1679,14.8562,3.6671,1.0669,3.7274,0.6085,1.7961,1.4933,0.0553,6.9893,1.1964,6.1141,0.273,1.1482,4.9081,1.2392,0.4184,6.3202,0.4587,1.5745,2.3294,5.255,0.351,2.2672,6.4416,1.2626,6.3238,6.0097,1.9657,1.6872,2.4015,3.7845,5.3809,1.5353,1.6157,2.5533,0.4083,2.0646,2.7541,4.65,0.0162,1.378,2.5323,2.9767,0.127,0.2166,2.7479,6.0716,0.0517,3.3814,0.466,0.501,3.0732,0.5937,1.0145,3.9472,2.5567,1.3988,2.2761,0.6511,0.2059,1.4375,4.3228,7.5822,3.019,1.8864,5.5706,1.6273,3.9796,6.6193,0.9118,1.4417,5.237,0.5778,4.6595,15.7224,7.9604,3.7286,2.3516,1.7704,6.4558,0.2386,0.2631,7.2151,8.6148,1.5662,6.8405,0.2314,3.9152,3.2983,2.5384,6.008,1.9043,0.4596,3.452,4.6576,0.7473,5.767,1.846,0.9148,0.468,5.3026,6.0692,0.4298,1.329,1.4117,2.0174,0.0338,6.5394,2.8574,5.6032,0.3416,2.8411,0.7551,5.2356,7.389,4.2089,0.5408,1.1597,0.0115,2.9701,4.0707,2.467,3.9435,3.1107,0.7964,2.4445,0.2269,1.9492,2.991,4.1752,1.5789,0.9498,4.6072,3.9662,2.2784,0.3317,0.4412,3.0196,2.0912,6.5752,1.5509,1.5041,6.1279,3.0335,2.1141,5.3394,2.7123,3.5477,0.8159,2.7703,2.0711,5.0591,1.8505,3.3485,2.0424,7.3238,0.0235,0.4946,2.3468,3.1449,4.4173,10.0289,0.1797,3.1372,13.4494,9.4428,9.7081,6.2532,0.0016,0.0002,1.4305,2.533,2.736,1.4018,0.1203,0.0119,0.3125,0.5273,0.057,4.2093,1.0587,0.1031,0.1098,0.4081,0.5211,1.3205,2.5381,3.717,1.2403,0.3853,1.9488,5.956,1.0971,2.9315,0.4027,0.1506,3.3389,2.7915,2.8604,1.3514,1.584,0.1708,0.9071,1.1397,0.1584,0.6433,4.406,3.2385,2.095,4.6089,0.403,0.1995,1.5236,2.4112,0.2318,0.003,6.0957,0.4063,0.3648,5.1878,1.4532,3.224,2.7801,4.2221,7.4025,1.0665,0.6657,4.9005,0.3551,5.2426,2.0,0.0801,2.4269,0.7258,4.4819,0.2515,2.6263,0.0573,2.943,1.1978,4.943,1.4994,1.3773,1.4082,7.3172,3.0682,0.7775,0.7886,6.7606,0.4968,0.3104,0.0001,0.0,1.7317,1.4334,2.2743,3.6677,4.0941,3.422,6.1599,0.1667,2.0539,1.7429,1.4245,6.0001,0.3789,2.3261,0.5498,1.4657,4.938,1.6547,16.8554,5.5272,14.6382,3.2129,0.7273,4.4651,4.072,3.0281,5.5911,6.3686,2.03,1.6914,3.1847,3.9046,0.4063,0.2417,3.9101,1.1936,5.3915,0.0303,4.7308,0.7315,0.2542,1.3695,5.9114,2.9053,5.2246,1.8017,4.3142,0.0071,6.3597,1.0414,0.0154,1.6278,0.5791,0.0018,0.7458,1.4425,1.6875,6.3948,3.1443,6.0985,7.1032,3.6615,1.42,2.7921,3.752,0.1945,2.7228,7.4485,1.5066,9.1067,3.2236,0.9702,3.1209,2.6185,1.039,0.7824,2.7195,0.1759,0.1257,1.1848,3.5528,0.5101,0.3163,0.3153,4.7687,0.003,0.0002,3.3293,3.0532,1.3181,1.274,0.6989,5.8203,3.1655,8.0751,6.5676,2.7176,5.4245,1.5127,7.8643,0.5252,3.1696,1.647,1.1615,0.5644,0.5539,0.0003,1.9523,1.324,0.4328,4.9534,0.7087,6.1769,0.0091,0.2524,4.798,0.8989,4.9904,0.7099,2.6101,3.3848,3.3255,3.9314,2.244,2.2907,0.0217,0.3417,3.4777,3.3319,1.7514,4.7427,0.1351,3.2325,3.4453,0.0979,2.2934,4.2387,1.6953,3.376,1.9701,0.0243,1.2926,0.4609,1.5223,4.785,2.2384,0.3256,3.7192,2.6226,2.3579,3.6902,3.2457,1.4623,6.4971,0.5263,1.4875,3.3163,2.1064,0.2546,5.3197,1.177,5.3357,3.0778,1.1976,4.897,2.0509,0.2064,3.6488,0.006,0.0007,3.3991,0.3549,0.3116,6.548,3.0838,0.557,5.4307,1.7581,3.7358,4.9685,7.9842,1.178,2.9325,4.4882,3.4379,0.6942,1.4817,6.7753,0.2218,2.4328,3.5654,1.9595,4.239,1.2946,4.679,3.9051,1.8443,2.4341,3.8527,5.2219,0.8653,5.2407,6.3789,0.5432,4.2445,0.7631,4.386,3.7316,8.1927,0.0342,4.0477,0.2541,4.6106,2.7587,1.3583,8.2147,5.3869,3.7099,5.539,0.7901,0.3913,9.4602,0.1841,0.0185,4.024,0.4429,5.1824,0.5711,4.5328,1.8319,2.2781,1.0474,4.1682,0.818]}

Trump and his advisers have discussed the possibility of using a speech to the U.N. General Assembly as a platform to push ahead with efforts to get North Korea to renounce its nuclear weapons programs. U.S. officials said the speech would highlight cooperation between the U.S. and South Korea as a counteroffensive to what Trump has called Kim \u2019 s hostile actions toward the United States and its allies.\nHe also may use the speech to reaffirm a United Nations Security Council resolution that bans the export of U.N.-sanctioned military equipment to North Korea and to point to economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to get North Korea to rein in its illicit trade in antiquities.\nThe speech may also focus on Iran, which U.S. negotiators expect to be a top priority on Trump \u2019 s foreign policy agenda when he returns from Vietnam. Trump told U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres in a telephone conversation that he had not decided whether he might seek talks with Iran \u2019 s new president Hassan Rouhani when he makes his first official trip to Washington next month.\nBut he said he wished Iranian officials well, suggesting, \u201cwe\u2019ve been talking to them quite a lot and they\u2019ve been really good to us.\u201d Trump said he was eager to seek further cooperation from Iran\u2019s neighbors Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Israel because he wanted to ensure there was no conflict in the Middle East. Trump also said that he planned to announce an unprecedented U.S. travel ban that would temporarily bar citizens from Iran, Syria, Somalia, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Sudan.\nPresident Putin, who will speak to the U.N.

{"prompt":"A firm that commissioned a \u201c dossier \u201d detailing links between then-presidential candidate Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign and Russia said in a court filing that Republicans leaked the company \u2019 s banking data to","text":"A firm that commissioned a \u201c dossier \u201d detailing links between then-presidential candidate Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign and Russia said in a court filing that Republicans leaked the company \u2019 s banking data to their own opponents. It \u2019 s just the latest in a steady stream of corporate scandals affecting political campaigns in recent years.\nWhile many are not surprised and do not consider it surprising that many Republican voters still support Trump, it is nevertheless striking. What is particularly shocking is the sheer amount of this corruption.\nIn one of the many filings that the whistleblower made, the company said that GOP operatives stole financial information from the company and also gave some of this to the Clintons and their campaign. A lot of this is very public evidence of it, with many people on both sides being accused of this kind of corruption. But what is also troubling is the way that the whistleblower saw this as just more corruption, while the Republicans were actually defending themselves against it.\nThat is true even in the face of the fact that the Clintons\u2019 campaign is far behind Trump in the polls. There was so much that Trump got right that people still believe that he has more in common with them than he does with the Republicans. But he has been portrayed as corrupt by a lot of people, including by the Democratic Party. This was seen as something that a lot of people still saw as a big defect.\nIn a way it was a big problem for the Clinton campaign, and even for the Democrats that put up Trump. But it is even more so for the GOP. They just don\u2019t want to get caught up into this kind of public scandals and they are trying to get out of it as quickly as possible, as much as they can.\nSo it seems as though many Republicans were not only trying to suppress information about their opponent, they were also trying to suppress information from any of the information that they would get from their opponents, including the way that they got this information.\nAnd again, this goes back to the idea of transparency. We have some problems when it comes to getting the information. But we also keep on hearing allegations that the other parts of the US and other countries are doing something that is even worse than the Republicans are doing.\nThis is, perhaps, a result of the WikiLeaks scandal that was a huge public embarrassment for the US, and for the leaders of Western Europe. It is also more of an embarrassment about the use of surveillance technology.\nThat leads to us being a bit more vigilant when it comes to transparency. Yet, in other respects, this is a different story.","token_len":528,"entropy":[9.2968,1.5965,8.6226,2.3975,15.6264,6.8242,12.9589,7.3195,6.83,5.671,5.3287,0.1239,6.1144,0.6061,3.2158,0.7208,0.3259,0.5264,0.0572,6.9998,6.2512,9.2336,2.5207,0.3892,0.6718,4.4391,2.3665,0.537,3.9654,0.0629,1.5937,8.5758,7.0734,0.5799,8.8975,9.3273,4.2969,2.4023,10.5606,3.3837,1.009,4.9919,1.7582,5.8012,1.1107,4.6309,8.1687,1.7769,0.0221,6.1565,2.6921,0.5774,1.2921,0.1051,6.918,0.259,0.0119,5.3556,2.5687,6.2347,4.4007,1.6068,2.3709,1.6537,0.4611,0.4033,0.9328,16.0756,3.7075,4.0084,4.1928,2.3831,5.709,4.0692,0.079,4.7801,1.5869,4.5412,1.162,4.854,3.8903,4.04,5.2885,2.413,1.1485,0.6996,2.4757,0.9306,5.5484,5.4748,3.606,5.1307,1.2369,3.7557,2.8011,0.4084,1.8803,4.3306,2.6131,0.0159,6.0325,4.8227,1.7671,1.1463,2.8923,4.2904,1.3155,0.2802,3.9186,6.2876,2.7958,2.4972,7.8462,4.7606,1.6529,1.5674,2.3258,2.634,0.8059,6.1607,3.2366,5.8628,5.3457,1.0853,0.3788,1.5014,2.4,1.9667,5.2461,4.141,5.7856,0.8045,3.0694,2.5283,2.1365,4.8623,2.1989,2.0419,3.2112,1.0295,4.8397,4.932,0.1273,1.2386,2.4999,4.3901,4.9002,5.0965,1.2918,6.5698,2.0773,4.0939,3.0332,2.9088,5.025,1.8063,0.0305,4.5195,3.3997,0.2501,4.2635,3.7844,0.0091,2.0435,0.4108,3.7496,2.8732,1.0602,2.8042,3.5296,0.2009,1.1719,2.9005,2.1816,1.4308,4.2487,7.0955,1.9507,1.624,3.8843,4.5703,4.0407,1.9967,4.5861,2.1118,4.4086,1.6965,4.2361,6.7349,1.4936,1.9865,1.6341,0.2647,0.5028,4.6068,1.0987,5.4632,2.7069,2.5326,0.8797,2.5115,0.0028,1.5602,1.8202,0.0181,1.4542,4.3175,10.3576,3.1432,9.2382,3.1933,4.6528,4.4571,3.4803,1.2655,1.476,0.4395,0.9622,4.6865,2.9272,5.1074,0.0683,3.9702,3.2136,5.2443,2.8103,1.5622,4.8368,4.7798,3.1772,1.0543,1.4423,3.0054,3.8237,3.5729,0.077,0.0447,2.7079,0.1075,3.0872,0.7212,0.2961,1.5402,2.7041,0.3558,2.7369,5.0015,1.8684,2.8024,5.6215,0.4806,5.658,2.0161,3.0154,1.2469,0.0131,0.6822,1.6312,1.8416,5.7734,1.6678,3.9538,0.9203,0.9613,3.1593,3.3721,4.4582,0.8829,3.8888,0.7009,5.0949,0.2939,0.0183,0.7014,5.4928,4.8528,0.213,1.522,3.1819,8.9455,2.1496,0.6637,2.8828,2.5137,3.0995,2.5036,2.1892,1.9518,2.9254,3.843,1.1273,1.2476,3.2692,0.1694,1.43,2.327,4.4349,2.6928,1.1114,3.1395,4.2688,5.6828,2.6112,7.0303,1.4646,1.8048,1.5699,1.6518,4.0893,0.6336,3.0746,1.131,0.8462,2.5001,1.209,2.7017,4.7047,2.5497,2.9097,1.5395,0.324,2.2443,0.3623,4.2187,2.0282,1.1613,6.2273,1.1511,2.0938,0.0004,5.9112,5.051,2.9325,2.968,1.8066,2.9554,0.0869,2.6147,2.6066,0.5103,0.4734,3.539,0.6351,0.0266,0.1575,2.4542,2.9646,3.4683,0.0675,1.1397,0.077,0.453,0.7408,3.1742,2.2312,3.2143,2.7678,0.6465,3.8845,1.7068,3.3851,3.3282,3.6726,4.0101,0.0531,6.3463,5.1526,1.5189,2.5423,3.5482,1.0418,1.7927,0.2698,0.7168,0.7179,0.0209,3.2073,2.009,3.8108,5.7592,2.6883,0.9489,7.4964,0.8589,1.682,4.2097,3.3614,1.4032,2.8184,1.3075,2.2534,2.3354,1.7564,5.9025,1.4067,1.1545,4.33,3.2156,0.3059,0.5904,0.7335,3.6219,5.5834,0.289,1.577,5.7941,0.6911,0.0785,0.6419,4.2665,2.0903,4.3627,0.6818,3.7023,1.7194,4.7315,5.1697,3.1538,1.5472,0.0068,0.0017,4.5334,3.5176,1.3019,3.6081,2.9604,2.1017,1.1518,8.5807,4.1537,4.4033,7.1877,1.4157,1.9021,5.7861,8.6572,0.0296,0.4605,6.2918,5.001,2.4708,0.5219,0.7932,1.9546,2.5159,2.1561,1.1688,5.095,0.693,0.4153,2.161,4.2107,1.8267,1.2889,0.3573,0.8272,3.0413,0.6769,5.4404,4.7748,0.0932,2.1591,5.6726,0.0519,0.9261,7.6682,3.1232,2.1775,2.7907,4.0237,3.2057,3.9375,1.5248,0.3769,0.6575,3.2469,2.3983,1.245,2.3213,0.6769,6.9556,0.1602,6.2872,3.3392,0.9718,2.226,1.4462,1.1145,5.5967,2.1828,1.8177,1.2193,6.9774,0.8564,6.0624,0.0247,4.5975,3.2719,2.3488,1.3847,3.9141,6.3892,1.3399,6.0186,5.7125,3.6776,2.1664,1.1282,6.1782,3.4803,0.1962,0.0036,0.0014,4.7251,0.5917,7.509,1.7226,2.8552,4.4472,3.6513,0.5855,2.6622,0.8221,1.6948,3.8489,0.6729,0.321]}
{"prompt":"The European Commission added to mounting confidence in Brussels that it is set for a Brexit deal with London when it scheduled talks with EU lawmakers ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday with Theresa","text":"The European Commission added to mounting confidence in Brussels that it is set for a Brexit deal with London when it scheduled talks with EU lawmakers ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday with Theresa May on what to do next. The bloc\u2019s chief negotiator began talks in Rome ahead of Sunday\u2019s summit that is expected to yield a concrete plan for leaving the bloc\u2019s single customs union and regulatory union and set the stage for Britain\u2019s May withdrawal agreement from the European Union. \u201cWe are making preparations for this week\u2019s meeting and this week\u2019s trilogue,\u201d Catherine Ashton told lawmakers after a two-hour meeting with European lawmakers. \u201cThere are two things that need to be resolved to prepare next Friday: if we can get agreement on whether we are talking about a partnership, or an agreement, which is what this week\u2019s meeting is going to address and whether we will take out the dispute over the Irish backstop which will be discussed in this weekend\u2019s meeting,\u201d said the Irish ambassador. While EU leaders are due to meet in Brussels Sunday and May in London on Monday, there is little clarity as to what\u2019s next. The Irish backstop is the most contentious issue in a divorce bill May has proposed for Parliament, and it would keep British and EU goods separate on the Irish nation\u2019s largest island. A compromise that would ease tension, seen by many as a last-ditch attempt to avoid a No Deal Brexit, has been held up by what the EU\u2019s chief negotiator term a \u201cpolitical stalemate.\u201d British unionism has been increasingly calling on May to scrap the mechanism. The 27 European Union leaders had been slapped with the \u201cdo or die\u201d Brexit ultimatum by British Prime Minister Theresa May, and she was forced to accept EU demands. But many fear an exit without an agreement would have the worst effects on British workers and could lead to a chaos in the economy. In an attempt to calm the waters, May is expected to announce new measures to ease some of the pain when EU leaders meet, in a strategy aimed at getting approval from parliament, particularly Conservative rebels. But it also risks being seen by unionists as weakening Britain\u2019s EU commitment. The EU is expected to offer the United Kingdom permission to extend its Brexit transition period beyond the deadline it has given itself of December 29, by a maximum of three months. That would allow Britain to remain in the bloc\u2019s single market and customs union until at least the end of 2020 to avoid harsh economic penalties.","token_len":529,"entropy":[8.1703,1.7011,7.151,2.8016,8.0419,8.657,1.1333,4.8592,1.5418,2.1595,2.5083,6.1953,3.9059,0.5966,4.2647,1.4806,2.8359,6.8301,4.6322,0.7571,8.1384,4.5554,1.1151,3.0234,4.821,5.6126,0.0007,2.0577,6.8506,1.7799,0.8857,2.4614,3.3161,2.7242,0.0025,2.652,4.524,1.8523,0.125,1.8688,0.2923,3.9576,4.2866,14.2478,7.6736,1.9029,3.5035,0.5958,9.5613,1.8657,2.5986,4.944,5.2841,0.0003,3.753,5.7579,0.9557,2.0393,2.4341,4.3743,2.5527,0.9435,0.0124,6.8458,0.845,7.0598,3.6964,0.8316,4.5464,0.2416,1.3719,2.4904,0.0571,1.1811,2.3299,5.3726,0.0363,1.9276,6.8166,1.9248,3.9191,5.1064,2.3153,1.6017,0.012,4.1436,3.1839,0.2629,0.0343,7.2841,6.298,6.0458,4.7605,0.1146,1.9807,0.1588,0.687,6.1252,3.9842,8.3221,1.3979,5.6412,3.5249,0.785,3.1142,4.6881,0.5465,0.0507,0.4185,1.6294,2.4961,4.5987,0.9286,0.5153,0.0019,0.0809,8.9499,7.0745,1.8228,2.2224,4.3882,6.6984,9.0487,0.1741,3.0195,4.8161,4.7147,1.857,4.4157,0.0704,0.7692,0.6402,2.3792,2.6832,4.2195,1.6085,1.7245,0.236,3.9756,1.6186,3.4074,2.71,1.2461,2.2756,0.035,0.9581,4.8459,4.924,6.1827,7.6908,6.3497,4.1525,6.8538,0.8525,2.8167,2.1819,4.7676,0.6586,5.5684,0.8734,2.4156,5.6481,0.6083,1.0972,7.1699,2.297,2.2313,3.4369,1.8212,2.2456,4.191,1.2373,2.227,3.7437,2.8227,0.4425,0.0962,0.0082,0.8299,0.9536,2.7046,0.005,5.7296,2.5981,3.3014,0.659,2.8299,4.5194,6.2614,2.0812,8.1014,4.6427,1.4876,5.0146,6.7666,4.0947,4.6269,3.5305,1.1794,3.282,1.6476,2.9779,5.7659,1.1212,0.0902,0.1249,1.1288,2.328,0.3412,0.8137,3.2966,2.8316,5.9675,3.2675,1.5378,6.2456,3.3213,1.388,1.7503,4.2432,0.0448,1.0346,1.4299,0.8984,5.7803,3.4137,5.0458,3.7348,3.2311,1.6124,0.8803,0.4795,3.1606,0.871,2.46,3.9275,1.9365,0.0516,1.1338,9.4386,1.7565,0.3993,2.6984,3.9386,2.1879,3.0578,7.3438,0.0055,1.7404,2.6037,3.5695,2.2549,0.8128,1.4947,3.7312,6.0223,3.8562,11.5878,0.9043,3.1472,2.7385,7.695,1.5972,1.5242,2.3976,2.7195,6.3778,4.991,4.0745,2.7055,5.7856,6.29,4.5687,1.1479,1.6877,8.538,1.7821,0.305,0.1235,8.4594,4.4162,0.4298,3.7537,5.103,3.4153,1.0179,7.0345,6.6122,4.1768,8.2408,2.624,1.4143,0.3288,0.9068,3.2743,1.1704,0.12,0.0,1.0819,0.3786,2.2848,0.7434,8.3181,6.7695,6.0796,0.7795,1.6407,1.0627,5.0766,0.3874,1.0167,7.0247,3.1349,2.3537,5.2042,0.041,0.0042,1.3806,0.0216,10.6669,1.5608,11.1854,1.3527,6.6343,4.4548,0.0009,1.4725,1.9443,1.9662,5.9217,8.0897,4.3959,1.6219,1.1092,5.0225,7.7002,2.9373,1.4269,0.1519,3.3663,0.5758,8.5486,4.2051,2.3351,6.689,4.1299,1.3929,2.0204,4.0415,2.2348,11.1633,0.5126,3.3587,10.4828,0.7327,9.1372,7.0284,0.8265,0.1035,3.0551,6.9988,6.232,0.0016,0.0152,2.8032,3.95,1.1659,0.0073,0.3733,0.0041,1.8771,2.167,2.8691,2.8932,1.4336,0.0801,4.5608,8.2648,1.8656,3.2514,3.3361,4.5681,4.9303,4.3403,3.5539,3.9455,3.0777,0.5157,2.8908,4.2827,2.6706,4.2008,2.9746,0.6386,3.4901,2.711,1.4096,5.0908,2.2326,0.032,1.3948,8.0687,1.1449,0.608,2.5682,0.8139,3.8303,2.6012,2.3746,0.0206,3.6135,1.3364,5.2209,0.3895,2.0747,3.3265,1.7429,0.0156,2.9478,4.8121,2.0573,1.3829,2.6776,4.2079,0.2767,0.1972,3.6844,6.2296,5.5141,0.8031,0.3962,5.843,4.2305,2.5943,7.5733,4.6804,0.0461,3.9688,8.0244,1.8363,3.2223,3.272,9.0561,7.2692,4.8496,0.9566,3.3655,2.6656,3.6592,3.2963,3.927,0.8263,3.9666,7.1402,0.8094,0.1299,6.6034,3.3043,1.1454,0.0325,0.0059,4.6604,7.7778,2.9336,2.3475,3.274,1.9659,2.1521,0.0138,4.7503,3.3382,4.2087,0.2012,7.5279,0.1544,5.0622,1.9638,4.8129,6.2119,0.9459,4.7687,1.5467,4.2522,5.1448,2.65,4.792,4.0096,5.8559,5.0287,3.6911,1.2899,6.0617,3.7333,4.6115,0.1028,2.0425,1.0417,0.4002,3.389,1.2541,2.0508,2.0979,0.2123,3.9604,0.5049,0.107,2.4864,3.2959,0.0142,0.0576,0.3413,0.6792,1.1012,0.7305,0.0036,2.4586,2.4814,0.0057,1.793,0.2597,0.0023,4.5778,5.9384,1.7114,9.1489,3.0125,2.2373,1.0626]}

The White House said the fired senior White House strategist oversaw no White House operations. \"Bannon will be a key part of the effort to defeat Donald Trump and we wish him the best,\" the president's transition team said. Bannon is an architect of the president's immigration overhaul. After Trump tweeted last month that Mexico is paying for Trump Tower, he asked if a Mexican billionaire wanted to \"go inside\" Trump Tower. \"These are the same lies that the Left are going crazy over. The truth is these lies are just Trump's latest tactic,\" Bannon wrote on Twitter. \"I am leaving the White House with great pride, great honor and a lifetime of hard work.\" In a press conference later in the day, Trump told reporters that he would not hire Bannon's former allies. \"I am not going to hire any of the people,\" Trump said of them. \"I will hire those who help me defeat the left, the people who will fight for the American people.\" Bannon's last day in White House employment came in September 2016, days before Trump was elected President, and Trump's first order of business was to fire Bannon. Bannon's main task was overseeing Trump's policy agenda but he also was heavily involved in the presidential campaign and handled media relations. He was also in charge of the National Strategy for the U.S. Election System and for the presidential transition. Bannon was said to be working on an alternative political and economic order for the United States. The day following his firing, Bannon announced that he will run as a candidate in the 2019 congressional election for the Republican nomination for the House of Representatives to represent California's 35th district. The Los Angeles Times reported Bannon's announcement would lead to a series of endorsements from Republican officials to increase the candidate's chances for election. During an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Bannon said that because Trump didn't fire him, \"the White House is going to attack me on the left\" and it might look like Trump has lost confidence in the campaign. \"It seems very risky for me to come here from Russia, from Syria, from everywhere I am at times,\" Bannon said.

The House passed the legislation, which now turns to the Senate for consideration, with a vote of 317-327, after a marathon effort to address loopholes in protections for the health industry and small businesses. The Senate will soon reconvene and could approve the bill, if it so chooses. There are loopholes that need to be addressed before the bill can be signed by the president, but there were indications that Republicans had reached a consensus on some provisions that had not been adequately considered at the House level.\nThe coronavirus pandemic will hit the region\u2019s economies hard, with all countries reporting a sharp drop in the number of active cases of COVID-19.

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump was wrong to have posted anti-Islam videos on Twitter that had originally been published by a leader of Britain First , a fringe , far-right party , a spokesman for Prime","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump was wrong to have posted anti-Islam videos on Twitter that had originally been published by a leader of Britain First, a fringe, far-right party, a spokesman for Prime Minister Narendra Modiji\u2019s coalition government said on Thursday.\nThe comments comes as India\u2019s top court, the Supreme Court, begins its highest-ever term of four years.\nThe tweets were posted during the campaign for the British General Election on June 9 and were included under the #Remain campaign, which was backed by Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May. They were deleted from her Twitter account later.\nManoj Patil, Minister of State for External Affairs, said on Thursday that President Trump\u2019s tweets \u201ccould have been misconstrued by some segments of Indian public\u201d as a \u201cdirect support to the anti-Muslim violence being perpetuated in the name of so-called freedom of expression in the U.S.. \u201d. He also condemned Trump\u2019s tweet for \u201cinsulting the sacred memories of the victims of the terror attack in Pulwama\u201d.\nThe U.S. president has often commented on recent bombings and has shown an apparent disregard and inaction about the violence.\nIn July, Trump tweeted that the death of a soldier, a white guy named Ashli Babbitt, killed by a black man was \u201ca good thing that took place. We must fight against that.\u201d\nThe U.S. Department Of Health And Human Services Office of Civil Rights announced today that three hospitals in Iowa that violate the federal guidelines for racial and ethnic bias have been required to pay between $500,000 and $1.5 million in civil penalties.\nLast year, hospitals in Iowa were forced to make racial and ethnic disparities corrections in less than two months.\n\u201cIn this case, hospitals had significant time to make significant changes. While the majority of hospitals in Iowa are already in compliance with the standards and this was not the worst case scenario, the action will send a clear signal to hospitals across the country that their compliance is now being closely monitored,\u201d said Linda Bunch, regional director of the Office of Civil Rights. \u201cThe data collection and tracking systems that we have put in place are extremely effective at identifying and taking action against hospitals that have repeatedly failed to comply with these standards.\u201d\nIn March 2019, HHS announced the National Action Plan for Dealing With Racial And Ethnic Bias in Health Care. The plan outlined a series of 15 commitments that hospitals must make in order to be considered compliant.","token_len":531,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,4.1021,7.5213,0.5783,4.9829,8.1901,5.543,0.0067,4.8646,2.4876,0.856,1.7591,4.5568,3.3351,6.5846,0.598,3.6439,0.7236,2.1311,7.7427,0.1695,6.9537,9.4339,0.6359,1.3697,5.183,4.4377,2.2496,0.0504,0.0474,2.3616,1.8171,3.7368,3.5193,0.588,5.456,0.0016,8.5362,11.4698,0.4339,11.7939,11.7012,5.8127,6.2514,2.192,0.4935,1.4993,1.9874,0.0915,0.3246,13.9195,2.9685,7.9891,1.3328,4.4493,11.1607,1.4727,0.002,4.2869,3.0407,3.9063,2.2262,1.2572,0.0029,0.907,5.5298,2.1598,7.2013,1.0321,1.7282,6.7971,1.7091,4.0926,0.3886,2.0672,0.6046,9.2306,5.1912,1.6262,1.4867,4.8715,1.3773,3.6062,3.8493,1.1029,5.5563,7.0046,0.0297,3.2699,2.6836,2.8134,2.0585,1.4788,5.15,4.905,1.4709,6.3153,6.3267,0.277,2.8376,2.6182,0.9991,2.0738,4.6153,0.0229,6.6166,2.9483,0.0114,0.3206,0.0026,0.9955,4.6857,0.9557,4.361,3.6186,5.7575,0.9829,0.6276,4.7726,3.3118,0.1541,8.2002,3.2956,5.1494,0.4292,0.5595,7.3076,0.4727,0.812,0.147,1.2461,0.0168,0.6825,0.9741,2.1794,0.8258,0.4121,7.3293,0.4813,6.4988,0.0874,0.0023,0.9576,9.126,5.958,4.7065,1.2723,0.5035,4.843,0.8078,0.0011,2.4247,1.9565,8.8972,0.0758,3.2308,3.0576,2.5542,8.1263,4.7458,2.6689,12.8864,0.8434,8.771,5.8403,1.9346,1.6713,4.2978,0.0116,0.7908,5.7749,5.1103,5.2014,0.006,1.3759,1.9464,3.4671,0.0032,8.7743,0.0527,0.0006,4.8896,0.2044,1.4279,3.1936,1.4011,2.726,0.0003,0.0743,4.3096,5.5035,4.8767,7.0495,4.1432,2.4936,6.2956,3.9237,1.3616,0.1046,0.0018,2.4258,1.8332,5.4183,0.1437,4.5083,0.3631,0.0027,1.9873,7.4393,9.215,0.1655,2.3569,1.9716,0.501,1.0733,3.773,1.2321,0.6161,10.9206,0.8967,0.0012,3.1512,3.095,1.7821,0.2204,2.5206,3.8381,0.0018,0.0678,0.1756,2.3957,2.1291,4.5807,5.6083,0.3865,5.9816,7.8967,1.8761,5.4385,5.3199,3.2915,5.2763,4.2966,6.366,6.4927,5.2255,1.1406,3.5151,2.4707,1.1924,2.982,3.4904,0.3396,2.0041,1.4169,1.418,2.2114,5.0624,1.8373,1.5236,4.1414,3.9683,3.1598,5.9975,7.7997,5.0156,6.3584,12.1021,3.7477,9.26,1.8297,0.4074,5.1431,2.581,1.3843,2.4818,1.2016,2.4019,7.1709,0.1176,3.1776,4.6236,1.0166,3.8937,6.734,0.4288,2.8106,6.3313,2.6291,4.5862,2.7825,4.0083,1.5233,3.873,1.7693,1.3692,2.3663,2.5052,0.0008,0.0288,0.0461,5.55,9.6528,6.1794,4.23,0.0061,0.0073,7.4927,0.4465,2.4255,0.0036,4.4738,4.4188,0.2468,5.2471,5.7116,0.4585,6.6582,3.5426,11.1107,0.9625,2.384,3.2951,0.9442,4.9785,2.8457,1.2815,5.5749,1.5958,0.3691,5.0557,0.1023,3.6902,6.9225,0.1359,2.7821,0.6729,0.0094,0.1586,0.0142,0.2583,1.6374,0.4854,0.0143,0.8337,2.0426,1.7568,1.5592,0.6869,5.8482,2.0115,0.1219,8.594,0.7779,2.7495,1.8162,3.2747,0.0344,4.8673,4.8933,0.3535,0.0405,4.4512,11.318,2.8262,7.6234,0.0582,1.897,1.8332,1.2179,0.7914,4.4431,2.1027,3.9477,4.6957,0.7506,0.124,5.3948,3.744,8.9531,5.7002,1.2556,3.0017,4.5989,1.7325,2.3505,4.8862,1.5725,6.071,0.0971,2.0249,1.7201,0.6481,2.3782,4.647,2.8438,0.2477,0.3615,0.632,4.5277,3.798,6.7017,2.502,2.3926,1.0329,8.4543,1.5127,2.1885,0.3433,1.5178,6.9604,4.457,5.3874,0.3023,2.3647,2.217,0.8802,2.0553,2.3952,0.1229,0.4803,0.3522,3.3076,2.835,1.8498,4.8259,2.7755,6.0224,0.3832,2.8068,7.1901,1.4977,2.1637,5.7839,4.4185,5.5541,0.3509,6.5895,0.5869,0.7725,0.4854,3.0141,0.1015,0.2039,0.0254,1.133,4.3397,1.2649,2.3688,6.5783,4.9223,1.5682,6.1933,4.8455,2.4126,3.4428,1.3287,4.7139,0.3808,0.0025,1.8122,4.6189,2.2747,2.2476,2.7779,1.5088,4.7478,1.4243,1.1915,2.2645,0.7341,2.5843,6.2482,1.5491,0.1942,0.8277,0.3878,2.0788,1.1416,0.808,2.9794,0.6704,0.3175,2.7041,3.9425,10.1604,0.0382,6.5402,2.0473,3.2812,4.0632,5.1317,0.1923,1.5893,7.0376,1.1939,1.0128,2.7265,5.5494,0.0195,3.5686,0.0006,1.4561,1.5338,0.1974,1.0466,1.1626,0.6023,4.9401,1.9279,2.6114,0.0015,8.6412,7.0499,1.844,3.1857,1.6125,1.6783,2.3999,0.8948,0.0682,3.7555,3.0328,3.9627,1.5166]}

{"prompt":"The Interior Department \u2019 s watchdog agency has launched an investigation into Secretary Ryan Zinke \u2019 s travels after reports emerged last week that he had used a private plane owned by an oil executive","text":"The Interior Department \u2019 s watchdog agency has launched an investigation into Secretary Ryan Zinke \u2019 s travels after reports emerged last week that he had used a private plane owned by an oil executive for official business.\nAn internal email from the Bureau of Land Management obtained by The Wall Street Journal on Monday reveals Zinke and his deputy Scott Pruitt received \u201cspecial\u201d permission for a trip home from their California compound to a \u201cprivate business meeting\u201d at the house of oil mogul Rex Tillerson\u2019s brother Scott at Palos Verdes. When they left the state about 13 percent of the way through their flight, the plane was still being controlled from a computer.\nIn a statement Sunday afternoon, Zinke denied knowing that he would be using a private jet, and later said he was \u201cnot aware that there would be any conflict of interest or violation of the regulations governing the use of a civilian aircraft on Department time.\u201d\nHowever, a Justice Department investigation has found that while Zinke was involved with the Bureau of Land Management, Tillerson and three of his siblings were on the company\u2019s board of directors. The Justice Department found that while the oil magnate was not aware that Zinke was working for the government he \u201creceived information from the Bureau\u2019s Office of Administrative Resources about Zinke that made Tillerson\u2019s involvement in the oil company a conflict of interest because Tillerson was also an employee of the Bureau.\u201d\nThe investigation was launched after several whistleblowers and officials in the Interior Department raised the concerns Zinke\u2019s use of the private jet. Despite Zinke\u2019s official position in the department, the jet has the exact same flight rights as the Secretary, and according to internal documents \u201ccould be dispatched at any time.\u201d\nThe Justice Department report found evidence that Tillerson had been given early notice of Zinke\u2019s trip to avoid possible conflicts.\nAccording to an email sent \u201cfrom within\u201d the bureau to Zinke and his top aides on Dec. 3, Zinke, Tillerson and the bureau director flew to \u201cCalifornia in the private jet owned through an unrelated company by someone whose company (Surrey Energy) was receiving payments from the Bureau of Land Management [\u2026]\nThe Justice Department\u2019s report found evidence that Tillerson had been given early notice to try to avoid the conflict, including multiple conversations between those involved in Zinke\u2019s flying arrangement and the office of the Department Secretary. (A spokesman for the Department refused to say if there were conversations with the Justice Department about the use of Tillerson\u2019s private jet.)","token_len":531,"entropy":[10.837,0.7678,13.1377,8.6191,8.2159,9.5444,1.7013,2.4034,4.0793,0.6601,0.2788,0.2992,6.1145,2.3052,0.1122,0.0003,4.6596,0.0792,4.1085,9.2409,5.5067,4.9582,5.7858,3.5913,0.5455,0.6336,0.506,1.6728,3.6572,2.2387,0.8805,2.189,6.2357,0.0176,3.2075,3.2772,3.7943,3.57,3.9587,0.1826,0.9419,1.1707,17.5586,3.0064,3.539,1.6944,0.9587,5.2084,0.059,0.1885,0.0018,5.9715,0.0885,0.9358,4.4465,0.0008,0.0001,3.7412,1.5175,3.7191,2.6357,0.0006,3.4823,1.2968,2.761,5.0729,0.0815,6.3132,11.8794,6.4013,10.7559,12.1362,5.8384,4.5345,3.9487,1.175,3.5165,7.2646,1.2631,3.8151,5.5381,6.7549,2.4922,2.5039,13.659,1.2977,2.9178,5.0614,4.0623,6.3361,3.6701,3.1433,0.8315,7.278,0.2361,5.1661,2.9842,3.8098,0.0192,2.6605,0.3396,1.9087,3.1673,5.3992,5.5173,8.2402,3.647,0.3255,0.0,1.5062,5.6374,2.637,3.0912,1.1744,4.3209,7.4283,6.2242,7.7241,0.1359,0.452,1.1009,0.322,1.5202,4.871,0.3559,1.4306,5.8021,1.5113,4.218,4.0124,6.4735,4.5719,2.1635,7.165,2.4331,0.5259,3.2698,1.7812,1.7066,5.4117,2.7464,0.1117,2.1594,0.0008,5.001,5.9441,2.3605,2.0659,3.4232,0.7915,3.2658,1.1118,0.2952,0.9233,3.0516,2.1772,5.9756,1.2521,1.0192,1.8122,10.2604,0.9575,2.0533,0.7639,2.15,4.1973,2.9955,0.0595,0.8061,4.7543,0.3546,0.042,3.0546,5.2832,0.0876,1.7246,4.1641,2.8996,1.7436,0.3718,0.0879,2.6402,6.99,0.7366,4.3055,8.9152,7.9353,0.4347,7.4182,5.1248,0.4923,4.2679,0.0184,2.6237,5.6426,0.0097,4.2402,2.5949,1.5422,0.3735,5.0397,1.3919,0.0007,1.8819,4.4276,2.2653,0.9758,4.7652,0.0886,0.006,0.002,1.0981,5.9027,2.3832,5.0034,2.1495,0.2008,5.4987,1.2297,3.6483,1.3831,4.0098,7.4797,1.3048,0.1944,2.0774,1.2116,0.0447,0.6683,2.0234,2.3518,0.0478,3.8856,0.3467,3.8286,1.9156,4.958,3.1428,0.0095,1.5149,3.0922,4.4103,1.2744,3.126,0.0005,0.8458,4.4459,0.9939,0.58,3.9956,6.0201,7.7135,0.3285,8.9306,6.0484,1.3273,1.8316,1.877,2.5083,0.0163,0.0756,2.7976,0.0124,6.2103,4.8439,3.1528,4.0831,0.0007,6.4024,5.1842,4.7601,6.1203,0.0502,0.0382,5.0749,2.0863,0.6106,2.8259,1.8763,2.5677,2.2179,0.1069,0.0194,4.9803,2.2892,1.5377,3.4369,2.859,2.3218,0.2097,0.4927,1.9785,1.196,3.5562,0.5485,0.2532,1.8043,3.6028,2.9558,1.7388,1.5751,4.8798,5.7825,2.5745,4.9961,3.2567,0.2594,2.3526,0.0187,3.7895,3.6678,3.0756,8.9361,0.0004,5.0238,0.144,0.0471,2.4854,0.0204,1.8705,0.9549,0.6481,3.9352,6.3352,4.0874,0.001,2.186,0.0704,0.0348,5.3882,3.511,4.0557,0.8341,3.9918,0.9099,1.1484,8.841,3.4506,6.3908,5.2027,0.0686,4.6358,5.5383,0.2308,0.933,5.3169,4.8961,1.6211,5.0817,0.0016,5.3989,1.0899,6.267,0.9938,7.6325,1.8103,9.3042,3.8008,0.3444,0.0817,1.2903,2.6666,0.6171,0.3025,1.7811,3.1933,0.0264,5.0392,2.4141,6.2249,0.4286,1.8188,2.7404,2.5483,4.0693,8.4161,2.9979,1.0424,2.7841,0.0023,0.5156,0.0283,0.0375,3.5188,1.0708,6.7053,5.5808,0.6629,4.8432,1.9676,3.8551,0.0045,3.368,2.4529,1.5804,7.4912,0.3059,2.7428,8.4565,7.8865,0.3663,0.6406,3.7318,1.8265,2.1934,0.0016,2.3673,1.0607,5.0211,1.3381,2.2798,3.8472,0.0043,3.3189,0.0981,4.2073,0.001,5.0296,3.7898,0.4513,2.7752,6.0051,5.0958,8.7532,0.6541,8.5112,0.1812,2.9663,2.6866,1.9032,3.6598,0.7884,2.9553,9.1087,2.3611,6.4825,1.2219,5.5746,6.5096,4.3719,3.981,6.8396,10.3002,3.1293,3.0609,1.001,1.3871,6.1695,2.8932,0.2415,0.7674,2.0994,0.9313,0.0114,0.0044,11.2412,2.0511,1.6932,2.1952,0.0183,5.0138,0.8481,0.3487,3.4688,1.5957,2.5939,0.0936,0.6492,1.8451,0.3378,0.1251,0.1366,0.0022,6.165,7.6341,0.2363,0.4124,4.5762,2.5665,3.1804,3.792,5.6719,4.3178,1.5776,5.8713,2.5478,0.9406,4.1832,0.0021,0.3549,0.02,0.0556,7.3542,5.1756,0.4498,1.674,5.2843,0.3035,1.2287,4.5409,5.1866,1.0203,5.8783,4.6377,4.1857,0.0819,1.1973,1.3576,5.8686,0.1216,3.3743,1.7711,3.7833,1.2249,4.826,2.0363,1.3937,5.3821,0.029,3.0982,1.5722,3.2074,0.0127,2.7657,1.2023,0.0509,0.0463,0.8634,0.1596,0.5939]}

For","text":"Affordable housing advocates are closely watching a package of bills currently under consideration by California lawmakers that would invest billions of dollars in helping to alleviate the state \u2019 s severe housing crisis. For a while now the state was investing a small share of its housing investment dollars into affordable housing. In the last few months this has been changed and affordable housing advocates will make sure that all new affordable housing is provided through the housing investment plan.\nThe current bills are called SB 721, SB 766 and SB 770. They would make available for the first time all the housing investment money that was formerly directed towards the Community Development Block Grant Program. If passed, all money directed towards the block grant now goes towards affordable housing. This is huge news for affordable housing advocates, who would like to see it funded with at least $1 billion a year. This is a very significant change and now we have all the money that exists in the budget available for affordable housing.\nAs an additional benefit, the legislature is also now saying that the housing investment plan will only spend the money on projects approved by the CA Department of Housing and Community Development. This should ensure better project quality, and reduce the amount of mismanagement that occurs so often with government funded projects.\nWe expect the legislature to come up with a funding proposal for the housing investment plan next week, before the legislative session ends. This is still a while away, but we think it is important to keep an eye on this proposal in order to see how much money will be available and how it will be spent. We also want to keep the conversation going about how the housing investment plan will influence affordable housing projects that are currently being proposed in the region.\nAs part of our regular publication of news and events relating to the work of the Affordable Housing Association in the London Borough of Camden, this week we will highlight some of the most exciting news from the past week, including the latest results of a survey undertaken by our colleagues at the Independent Living Trust, and the announcement of our first successful bid for London\u2019s Sustainable Housing Challenge. Also relevant here is our news report on the progress that Camden has made towards becoming the first London borough to reach the goal set by the Mayor of London for 20% of its workforce to be part of an anti-racism policy.\nCamden was one of the first London boroughs to receive funding from the Mayor\u2019s Sustainable Housing Challenge, an initiative of the London Borough of Camden supported by the Land Value Tax Commission. For details of how the Funding for Regeneration Fund (FRF) can be used, and the application for funding, please click here.","token_len":532,"entropy":[9.7237,1.9201,5.2933,1.988,8.0247,1.0381,4.3884,6.8134,0.3274,2.626,5.3412,2.5473,0.2322,1.7163,5.0185,1.8169,1.7514,0.4434,7.9313,3.6871,0.7264,0.0262,0.4071,6.7631,2.4692,4.8083,0.89,2.0828,19.6109,7.8141,8.8504,5.3135,0.804,1.0146,0.5458,5.4413,4.0485,4.2827,1.2335,3.4847,1.6868,4.9332,7.4788,3.3788,3.6299,3.8501,0.1266,0.5469,3.6181,3.2406,4.728,1.9127,1.7539,0.157,1.7149,2.8625,2.2708,2.2048,1.1979,1.6068,5.1749,0.9745,2.104,4.6425,3.3299,5.2302,0.1154,1.3734,5.9222,6.1466,1.8274,1.1563,4.1297,4.763,2.3665,0.1874,2.2766,3.5481,4.0293,1.4216,5.9928,4.5401,4.6803,0.8378,1.7748,8.2512,4.4292,6.259,1.9704,5.3737,2.207,3.7137,3.9802,1.0163,0.6267,0.9298,7.4536,1.396,0.0572,5.5206,0.4906,2.9293,2.3191,3.5705,5.5475,3.9442,3.3069,0.4102,0.0237,3.3493,2.4762,2.7612,2.8017,3.4303,1.2532,2.1953,6.5519,5.7276,2.1292,2.8469,6.8989,1.2031,2.3469,0.2357,1.6677,1.7338,4.5268,1.7891,0.9254,4.5061,4.721,5.5209,1.2961,1.7046,3.8803,0.3061,8.9555,1.0054,2.6191,1.9565,0.0321,0.7947,2.1845,1.9843,6.5742,3.4665,0.8317,2.8841,0.0418,0.1492,2.448,1.835,4.408,1.4377,0.146,0.479,3.4546,3.9397,2.8871,5.5516,0.0116,1.066,1.9156,0.7218,3.8689,0.0182,0.8117,2.8984,1.2442,1.6622,3.3562,2.5867,2.2623,2.2138,7.2235,2.5774,1.5274,4.87,0.606,1.9392,1.3415,7.4464,2.2209,0.6296,2.97,5.7032,1.4947,1.3204,0.0213,0.8322,0.9067,3.8928,3.8638,3.6125,3.5092,1.2699,1.7174,5.1219,1.9563,1.6987,4.8618,7.1798,0.2687,1.8884,4.0526,0.7901,1.1915,1.562,3.0004,5.2146,3.2289,1.3389,3.947,3.5424,5.1445,0.1802,0.423,7.0979,3.2607,0.0049,1.0561,0.6464,0.3229,0.354,0.7823,1.0859,5.5955,4.9209,7.2224,6.4109,3.0355,1.6981,2.4575,4.2339,0.7513,2.1946,0.1498,7.2502,1.7348,0.9682,3.0555,7.456,4.7215,3.3305,6.2311,3.4407,1.021,0.1586,0.7746,4.3551,4.9841,1.9779,2.352,0.2667,4.4543,1.1833,0.0036,0.4936,6.0888,3.17,1.9305,2.0403,1.5234,0.3179,0.1532,4.4808,0.7068,1.9471,5.5276,0.7316,3.3236,0.0796,0.8922,0.6953,3.1561,1.6207,5.7182,1.2683,5.3765,0.4284,0.8262,0.4739,1.3417,3.7513,0.9259,1.1559,1.7263,0.7123,2.8999,2.0296,0.1041,0.1531,1.6856,3.7492,3.8519,2.0832,0.0777,1.9159,1.6417,3.0638,1.9184,2.4978,0.2187,2.2755,3.4433,0.9913,2.6773,0.3818,0.7086,2.5667,0.3595,2.8176,2.6708,2.163,0.1251,2.7524,3.2523,3.1562,0.8968,2.0663,2.2742,2.1671,1.7234,0.2922,0.1315,0.727,5.9635,4.1912,0.0336,5.396,4.0567,1.2344,2.3753,1.587,4.6653,1.7382,1.0393,5.8962,0.2858,0.629,3.3851,4.0148,0.0011,2.1534,6.0934,7.7172,2.0883,5.0694,1.6648,3.5219,4.839,0.0022,1.277,7.2888,0.4074,1.3333,4.9913,0.0976,5.6242,3.2864,1.9014,11.5502,5.7764,0.0473,3.389,0.2707,4.1673,1.9604,0.5932,2.2718,5.776,2.0026,0.3322,0.2034,2.4566,4.0482,2.1824,1.9897,0.5906,5.4282,0.7363,2.7239,1.1431,1.3716,3.8582,6.1755,1.1903,1.5055,2.4363,5.8508,0.192,4.4649,5.8457,0.2413,0.8954,4.7571,4.0565,3.9189,2.1926,2.8823,1.4479,3.9463,0.9078,3.5201,2.7806,5.8565,5.4651,0.8989,6.0605,13.0362,1.0274,1.6009,7.0438,1.5203,4.6235,0.6855,7.0226,6.7986,4.0002,0.5416,1.9185,5.2818,4.1866,0.8928,0.717,3.8579,3.0577,5.6952,0.7231,0.0618,2.735,4.3251,1.4839,1.3751,3.5975,1.0013,0.3809,4.0177,1.2607,3.6057,3.8878,0.3984,0.5566,3.8193,1.1826,0.271,3.1476,4.9173,3.8579,0.2502,1.4282,6.3895,0.4156,0.8681,3.8272,0.0057,3.3551,6.6017,0.0417,4.6098,0.0388,4.3777,0.5743,0.4455,6.4335,0.0388,4.1105,2.0804,0.0071,0.657,0.5055,3.872,0.0348,0.0112,0.2157,3.6608,3.4733,0.9791,0.1786,2.3996,4.9947,0.0558,0.0617,2.2792,0.0203,0.0727,1.5866,3.9718,0.3409,2.5564,0.2941,2.2023,1.6865,0.8609,0.2913,7.2254,0.0449,0.5816,7.9058,7.1208,1.4963,5.1804,0.7719,5.1978,6.4328,2.0141,2.0885,1.5224,6.9569,1.4132,8.1962,0.6779,4.681,2.8782,4.8077,0.2832,0.0493,4.471,0.5707,0.2593,2.1751,3.3302,2.3241,6.3989,3.3799,1.5134,0.6814,1.088,1.8119,0.0943,0.448]}

On Monday, Moscow imposed a sever\nThe decision to break off negotiations following a recent change of administration in Washington, D.C., was no indication that the Obama administration was done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, says Jim Fitzpatrick, vice president for strategic and policy analysis at the trade group Business & Industry. As Business & Industry sees it, the administration just shifted its focus on other pressing issues, like the Iranian threat and the economy.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture says it has selected the contractor for the Environmental Monitoring, Assessment and Management (EMAM) Program, which assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of environmental programs that affect agriculture and agricultural markets. The contract is for five years, with a maximum bid amount of $45 million. The Environmental Protection Agency will select the contract from among the three highest bids. The scope of the service includes management of more than 5,000 natural resources inventories that are vital to agriculture and its markets.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency in March announced that nearly two years after the first EPA regulations targeting the greenhouse gas from agricultural sources went into effect, states were still reporting difficulties in calculating emissions in their emission inventories. This month, the EPA began working with states on emissions inventories, using new data to identify the most critical areas for action. If the results of the work are good, the EPA hopes to get it done by the end of the year.\nAn environmental review hearing in Washington state was designed to decide whether the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should take further action to protect native species from a proposed oil and gas exploration contract, a court filing shows.

The company's choice is a reflection of the political tension surrounding the project, a person familiar with the choice of consulting firm said.\nIn a small, mountainous rural Kansas town, some residents have chosen to leave and move to a more affordable location.

{"prompt":"Republicans in the U.S. Congress , long the staunchest opponents of the Iran nuclear deal , may be the best hope for preserving it if President Donald Trump declines on Friday to certify that Tehran","text":"Republicans in the U.S. Congress, long the staunchest opponents of the Iran nuclear deal, may be the best hope for preserving it if President Donald Trump declines on Friday to certify that Tehran has complied fully with its obligations to the pact.\nIf Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the deal appears to confirm those predictions, it would effectively make Trump more popular internationally than his predecessor Barack Obama.\nAnalysts say it would also make Iranian President Hassan Rouhani more likely to press forward with a proposal for a nuclear weapon.\nThe deal, which aimed to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program and restore confidence among its regional allies by providing rewards for compliance, has been blocked by a slumping stock market that prompted investors to move out of Iran\u2019s Treasury-linked stocks, pushing up the cost of government borrowing and leaving the nation with no money to meet its obligations under the agreement.\nIran has accused some Western powers, notably the United States, of sabotaging the nuclear deal, arguing that their goal in doing so was to destabilize the country.\nThe Trump administration first put the U.S. election on the top of the list, but since then it has made several statements that were critical of the Iranian nuclear deal in what has come to be recognized as a campaign strategy.\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the deal on Friday appeared to be influenced by his campaign rhetoric and could pave the way for a reassertion of U.S. sanctions, which were dropped in May as part of the agreement.\nBut analysts say Trump\u2019s decision \u2014 in the end a politically calculated one \u2014 to withdraw from the deal comes at the expense of his own re-election chances and could result in Tehran gaining much-needed leverage.\n\u201cThis is almost a sure vote for [Iran\u2019s outgoing president] Hassan Rouhani in the election in a few weeks,\u201d said John Sopko, a policy researcher at the Carnegie-Tamron Institute of Policy Analysis. \u201cAnd he wants to have the deal working by the time of the re-election.\u201d\nDespite the economic pain, analysts say Iran will be more determined than ever before to reach a deal that protects its future.\nThey also said the Trump administration may be giving its opponents \u2014 Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar \u2014 more of an uphill battle to defend the agreement against pressure from the Iranian regime.\nU.S. national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said Monday that the Biden administration would consider returning to it

LLC, the tax-dodging real estate investment company that is listed as a party to the suit, meaning the U.S. Postal Service should have received its letters before the suit was filed.\n\"The suit would have deprived the United States of the opportunity to recover its postal revenue,\" Buchwald wrote in ruling, adding that it would have \"created a substantial threat to the public interest.\"\nThe Postal Service has been working to build more delivery routes in order to reduce the time it takes to deliver packages and mail in general, and has been spending millions of dollars on automation efforts in recent years. But it has faced an uphill battle as it attempts to win over customers while also competing with competitors who offer greater efficiency.\nThe Postal Service announced in September it would stop delivering mail at homes after dark in most states to encourage people to use the mailbox rather than deliveries. But it has not seen much interest in the service. The government said it expects mail volumes to remain flat in 2018 because of slower economic growth and high usage of electronic means of communication.\nTrump's businesses, which operate through two entities the New York Post Hotel Company and the Trump Properties Trust, have been accused of laundering money through the hotels. Trump and his business partners have said they do so in order to help fund his political campaigns and to pay for other expenses.\nIn a filing with a federal court Wednesday, Trump & Co. said it would contest the lawsuit and asked the court to issue an order allowing the government to continue to collect its postal revenue.\n\"By bringing this action, Plaintiff seeks to preempt the ability of the U.S. Postal Service to recover its taxes and fees. Its primary concern is, however, its attempt to stifle the delivery of mail to millions of Americans,\" the lawsuit said.\nAccording to the law, which came into force in 2005, if a state or local government claims that it is wrongfully paying in excess of $5,000 in excise taxes to the U.S. Treasury because the government is using its employees to fulfill tax obligations that belong to the federal government, the government can bring suit to block the collection of the tax.","token_len":534,"entropy":[8.5834,0.966,1.5187,2.5373,0.3784,2.1447,1.7728,4.4931,0.0316,0.913,1.4793,2.4639,3.7301,2.1013,4.4365,1.6388,0.0061,0.2588,2.3664,0.8048,3.1862,0.0002,0.0041,0.0102,0.1112,0.8779,4.77,3.1689,2.484,4.3313,1.2252,4.1166,1.2678,1.9576,0.9032,2.3296,6.9949,2.6989,1.7561,0.0753,1.2963,4.5289,0.0005,0.0117,0.0478,6.9749,0.0456,2.8112,0.7817,3.769,1.6647,4.8868,3.3238,1.534,7.4491,0.504,2.0252,1.4073,0.5545,0.1489,22.273,3.0743,3.4052,2.8943,5.0922,7.9105,5.8307,7.3069,11.7644,0.6664,4.2408,0.3675,1.5591,0.0008,0.0078,0.0074,2.2724,0.003,0.0043,0.0416,0.0013,2.4919,0.0219,7.167,0.684,0.8275,0.8646,3.4178,2.2675,1.4944,5.0715,0.2408,3.6206,7.2505,0.4367,0.6736,4.0995,0.7645,2.1083,6.9051,0.2235,8.0963,0.1809,0.0521,4.8123,0.1531,3.6392,1.836,1.3506,2.7837,4.008,1.5295,0.5779,4.8383,0.4305,0.1738,2.1943,2.0358,6.2115,1.4381,3.7225,0.0003,0.0008,0.0034,0.7688,0.0196,5.4389,0.8554,4.6235,4.2789,6.725,4.7547,1.5905,3.5253,0.8688,0.1795,0.1704,0.2889,10.5113,1.3627,5.0381,4.2537,0.2716,3.8236,0.6488,2.8571,0.004,1.7427,1.6811,2.6514,0.2076,4.5413,2.6045,5.4813,3.7074,2.3521,1.3774,0.0009,0.3788,0.8588,4.9256,2.895,2.3329,0.244,3.2772,1.5195,0.3472,2.4131,3.4994,0.9356,2.5013,4.837,0.627,0.6323,3.4646,1.764,1.1302,0.1591,9.1565,2.6059,0.0327,2.6662,2.1055,4.2526,0.9685,5.6498,3.9599,7.348,2.8405,2.3366,3.6847,0.007,3.3043,1.4417,5.4162,0.5147,0.4718,0.5113,2.1935,2.6583,3.0314,6.5797,3.6067,4.5784,0.978,2.0275,2.8315,1.717,5.42,1.9813,0.6032,0.016,1.3981,7.6342,4.2635,2.692,2.0388,0.1634,0.7864,3.3716,2.8322,1.0289,2.6884,4.0232,1.2484,0.1088,3.8164,1.0902,3.5241,0.0166,6.2972,2.9044,2.3968,6.2162,2.4762,5.5785,0.5327,3.8977,2.765,3.3257,5.6545,3.7097,1.7089,0.3168,1.7432,2.0394,0.0157,4.7004,1.3527,2.8289,1.65,0.7705,2.5872,3.617,1.3826,2.9117,9.339,4.4492,6.7388,2.7543,4.7113,1.7606,3.8712,5.2308,2.3343,0.0676,2.1042,2.3277,10.0103,4.4154,0.0055,11.0086,1.3162,2.8596,2.2697,1.0695,3.0334,4.9409,2.6715,3.6595,0.9685,2.5276,3.0539,2.3773,2.8286,4.6923,2.1065,1.0333,3.6441,5.0742,5.1533,0.2376,3.9038,2.3186,1.8895,3.1445,3.8397,0.6365,4.9566,4.7147,0.1247,1.0601,4.9663,6.0876,1.3833,3.2005,5.5653,1.0615,1.877,0.45,0.326,3.3383,1.3423,3.8973,2.4228,1.5982,5.4649,4.2042,3.8445,3.1649,6.886,4.2003,0.0398,0.5199,10.1555,4.5824,0.3505,1.3437,0.8176,8.0354,3.6907,0.1628,1.4445,1.85,3.7687,0.3028,4.6796,0.9986,1.7204,1.694,4.7714,1.5863,2.6627,2.8384,0.3709,2.4973,1.3676,0.7381,2.0636,0.8578,3.6913,3.7132,2.2526,0.7671,0.0173,3.6566,4.6353,1.8097,4.3563,0.9013,1.5134,1.9148,3.2992,1.3458,4.6321,2.0081,0.9669,0.4994,2.7555,1.5829,2.4587,1.1902,3.7744,0.2663,2.3821,4.5273,0.1604,1.5296,4.3543,0.0079,0.1763,0.7097,0.9936,1.6319,6.8898,0.6188,1.593,1.6282,4.3736,1.154,0.9458,0.1547,4.526,1.5,0.4915,3.6359,0.9557,2.6915,0.0563,3.4039,1.4693,2.4181,2.9399,2.8881,0.7752,0.6782,0.7705,1.4014,4.5254,5.4871,0.4626,2.4626,0.6841,7.5196,2.4274,0.588,5.4042,1.0724,4.8501,0.1386,0.2879,2.1007,0.0003,0.0007,0.0019,0.1701,0.0118,0.1517,3.0872,0.9976,4.6896,1.6618,3.1704,4.7769,6.7658,4.699,3.5457,0.3328,5.4147,2.5585,0.005,3.3876,7.0704,0.0353,4.9233,0.0563,1.2249,3.3103,0.1913,1.2946,1.9035,5.495,0.0584,0.5899,1.3781,0.7265,3.4002,0.3899,0.1107,0.4164,6.4285,0.002,0.8127,5.5207,0.888,5.6947,5.7686,0.0594,0.9059,0.5977,3.7824,0.1853,3.8156,0.8907,2.96,1.6886,0.7342,0.5524,6.1327,2.0163,1.3854,1.6714,7.2688,1.0262,4.2583,5.5226,1.4087,0.0152,2.1765,2.6623,0.6718,0.0564,2.654,5.4801,0.244,2.1615,1.7927,2.2698,0.0004,0.0004,0.0321,4.0928,4.2438,2.2053,2.4345,1.9259,3.0859,1.6523,6.4225,1.2266,5.3766,4.5842,0.3242,4.0207,7.0835,0.0676,1.1505,3.2381,0.0112,0.1757,0.7683,1.9038,1.9821,3.1376,3.1685,2.423,4.4774,0.5939,4.3312,0.8406,1.1226,1.7498,0.5898]}

Roy Moore, drawing backlash and anger because it could be seen as a reference to two decades of allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate.\nJones said of Moore that \u201dyou did not need my mother to tell me that he is not who we are voting for on that day.\u201d\nMoore\u2019s spokesman said the candidate doesn\u2019t recall the statement in the meeting \u2014 a fact noted by Jones.\nA candidate or campaign official could be named an \u201cabuser \u201d if allegations are true and that candidate or agent is subject to federal law, however.\n\u201dThere is no justification for using this name-calling about a candidate\u2019s character when you\u2019ve got a lot of work to say for your opponent,\u201d said GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole, a frequent critic of sexual misconduct allegations. \u201cPeople are suffering here and that\u2019s not in America\u2019s interest.\n\u201cThis is an ugly, immature and very un-American way to attack someone else,\u201d he said on Fox News Saturday.\nThe political world has grown wary after the now-defunct website WikiLeaks published a leaked cable about Moore. The cable said Moore, then a state senator, was trying to blackmail a woman against her will.\n\u201cYou need a credible way to bring Moore to account if he is, in fact, guilty of his allegations,\u201d said Rep. Marcia Fudge (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Rules Committee.\nAfter the leak, Moore denied the allegations against him, saying he is innocent and \u201dconfident\u201d he will win the U.S. Senate election.\n\u201dThis is the final chapter in an incredible story, where an individual is engaged in criminal activity, in the pursuit of personal gain,\u201d former President Barack Obama said Saturday. \u201cIt is not the worst thing there is \u2014 we should be proud of the American public that we can say that we can have a strong independent judiciary, to be able to do the things that we have done on that matter. \u201d\nMoore faced allegations of sexual assault when he was a student at Tulane University. Some women accused Moore of trying to rape them or forcing them to have sex with him, whereas others had said Moore forced them to have sex.","token_len":534,"entropy":[4.2004,9.6717,4.4259,2.2458,8.0201,1.5574,5.7013,0.0526,0.0211,0.0801,3.6562,0.9031,3.2814,13.8944,8.2194,10.0211,7.0241,4.8395,6.7651,2.0338,1.8089,4.9962,4.0452,0.3551,1.0784,4.5207,3.7073,3.0946,2.4097,6.4883,7.1735,0.2285,3.7972,8.0553,5.2914,0.0024,0.0065,0.2186,2.0216,0.4343,2.1108,3.415,0.324,4.0508,0.9199,0.0202,5.0521,1.5884,4.278,5.1892,1.8672,3.8675,0.1488,2.3502,4.2423,3.1113,2.3204,0.0014,2.3646,0.0031,0.9807,8.0655,4.4538,3.1847,4.3911,6.718,3.1964,4.5285,1.943,2.9282,0.0705,1.2928,3.0244,0.0128,6.7583,5.0042,0.392,3.6046,0.9055,0.4006,0.5366,1.2105,2.0492,5.1699,0.3716,0.5919,23.5196,3.4053,5.3144,0.8671,2.2894,8.3306,2.1475,9.9858,6.0605,0.8537,4.1388,4.9991,6.1134,1.4693,1.0417,2.7877,1.7005,3.3701,3.1385,2.5787,6.263,3.8386,1.6535,8.8542,0.0643,5.456,3.7359,4.2992,1.4126,4.3663,2.9947,1.547,6.1283,7.584,6.9526,3.1977,5.8825,3.1508,1.776,4.0077,5.1976,3.315,4.3724,0.0762,4.6606,2.0132,4.8854,3.7469,3.5368,7.3761,5.8947,2.8633,3.6783,5.2357,0.5621,3.9814,2.2115,0.4659,5.3096,5.9917,5.1141,3.5776,1.9373,3.0862,2.7369,4.032,7.7135,7.1594,1.8076,8.1618,1.5919,1.5389,0.3593,2.1844,5.6827,1.0648,4.166,1.8657,4.3948,1.8707,0.9769,7.4256,1.6165,5.7109,0.0155,4.6679,2.7853,2.4462,6.1083,0.9479,0.66,3.4913,1.336,6.3756,0.9532,0.6431,7.5773,0.3293,2.3386,3.2965,3.7558,5.6462,0.0138,7.4301,1.2019,1.1534,3.0102,2.0074,1.6089,4.1593,4.4027,3.0997,3.8994,1.185,1.8232,3.6567,2.004,2.7245,0.199,3.8054,0.7363,8.9249,5.4449,2.2282,3.954,2.7609,2.405,1.2669,3.12,6.3116,4.5708,1.0208,5.2196,0.5916,0.0074,1.8078,1.5475,4.652,1.9473,0.0596,3.9793,0.547,0.9477,1.0265,2.9405,1.7059,6.762,2.4909,7.7617,4.433,2.6806,3.7651,3.2239,0.7548,0.7699,3.073,5.3317,5.5974,0.7411,0.1859,0.6516,1.2298,0.399,1.3325,2.371,2.8197,3.4071,0.8629,3.0062,4.9928,2.551,6.0851,2.0236,5.2344,4.132,1.9441,0.0318,1.9396,1.0272,4.8375,2.0878,5.7852,2.6869,0.8118,0.8848,3.1709,0.4964,5.1963,3.007,0.1229,4.8349,0.3122,0.5167,2.7948,6.2757,3.136,1.579,4.2691,6.7868,5.5345,1.8811,7.3569,0.4334,2.45,0.001,4.3503,1.9625,1.416,2.0645,6.514,4.6907,4.2239,3.4097,2.3666,1.6713,3.2417,3.3793,1.8466,2.4922,3.4806,1.2811,2.6622,0.9463,1.0367,1.9644,4.3814,0.0141,5.6359,1.7485,2.4006,6.7482,0.5247,0.0481,1.1896,1.0089,2.8211,1.9975,4.5876,3.7216,2.6799,5.4588,6.0164,0.429,4.8351,7.0004,1.2046,4.8911,3.3307,2.166,1.0826,6.1642,1.2927,0.0941,0.0056,3.6437,0.7632,5.8847,4.8102,1.9109,0.428,0.5413,0.9809,3.5518,0.0018,6.4282,0.0214,0.0134,0.0008,1.8149,2.8427,0.0967,1.6899,1.1064,4.4134,0.0049,0.05,0.1849,5.1637,0.1129,0.1794,0.4331,5.7953,1.2955,3.5653,0.3881,2.2642,4.22,1.1508,0.5914,4.1905,0.089,1.4311,1.4815,0.9837,4.0689,0.868,1.5093,6.679,1.3703,6.9468,0.8188,3.8602,1.4788,2.2532,2.3041,3.4994,1.6067,3.5944,0.0004,0.0016,0.0022,0.0439,3.8518,0.7525,0.4635,1.9878,0.3727,3.3119,0.6212,3.1156,6.5062,4.282,0.7114,2.6179,5.2298,2.1316,2.5132,7.5379,4.4193,3.3823,2.8738,7.2482,0.0678,4.0848,1.5195,2.0379,5.8073,2.3155,3.35,0.027,2.5846,1.0723,0.8844,0.506,0.4144,8.6258,4.1055,2.839,0.0045,0.5028,3.2108,0.9685,2.9444,2.1092,2.6531,0.9964,2.3526,2.4086,5.757,1.9035,6.3966,0.5702,5.8821,4.4623,3.3688,2.015,2.8962,0.266,1.9047,3.0728,4.4647,2.6861,2.0037,4.7991,4.4024,1.6825,1.8577,3.8104,4.7277,1.5259,3.427,5.0988,1.4081,1.4569,5.2238,2.1962,1.1758,0.0222,3.2416,2.4381,2.325,0.5191,0.8213,2.5735,1.1363,4.1621,3.6005,4.51,1.642,1.8525,1.1272,3.0719,4.6721,6.4522,2.6951,0.7432,0.7846,2.3039,3.937,0.104,0.2732,1.3202,3.8688,0.1157,6.484,0.0008,0.0461,1.8874,5.4101,2.8564,2.2701,1.4349,0.1188,5.3583,0.005,2.4645,0.1886,3.8495,4.1186,0.7056,0.279,1.6336,0.4207,0.8971,0.1269,1.9069,8.3675,1.1128,5.2774,3.1864,2.3738,3.4426,0.7642,0.2254,0.5493,0.636,1.8768]}

Reuters has not edited the statements","text":"The following statements were posted to the verified Twitter accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, @ realDonaldTrump and @ POTUS. The opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements.\nThe tweet came as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft had warned against any unilateral actions that could escalate tensions, adding that the U.S. is not seeking war. She also warned that Tehran was unlikely to change its behavior towards the west unless the Europeans take the same steps Tehran has taken. On the other hand, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that Iran was still seeking to advance its nuclear program and that the U.S. would not back down in any of its moves.\n\u201c We have already made clear that we are not seeking war. We are not seeking to take sides in the Iranian conflict. We should also be clear that Iran is not seeking to change its position and that unless the Europeans, of which we are part of, change their position, we would take the same step and that step would be a much greater one, \u201d the ambassador added.\nThe Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying, the country would not back down from its nuclear program and would take stronger measures in case any country tries to interfere in the country\u2019s energy sector or acts against the Iranian revolution. \u201c In light of these aggressive attempts, we have to remember that our defensive capabilities are very strong. And if necessary, we will respond, \u201d the tweet read.\nA tweet from the verified Twitter account of Deputy Secretary of State of the United States, for Europe and Eurasia, John Sullivan, said, \u201c In response to the latest escalation in the standoff at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry has issued a statement saying that they will respond to any unilateral action and will not back down from their nuclear program. \u201d Sullivan\u2019s tweet also referred that U.S. has stepped up security at the embassy \u201c in response to threats that are directed against the people of Iran. \u201d The tweet further pointed out that the Iranian Foreign Ministry is also calling for all people to protect the Iranian diplomats and to not allow any violence to take place.\nOn Monday, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad was attacked with ball bearings, flares and Molotov cocktails. The attack took place after the U.S. embassy opened its doors to a group of Iraqi activists holding a protest outside of the embassy, calling for the removal of the Embassy personnel in connection with the assassination of U.S. Diplomatic personnel in recent days.","token_len":534,"entropy":[7.2906,6.1509,1.6094,5.1922,2.2298,1.4007,10.3533,2.5742,3.002,0.3661,6.5793,0.6589,0.0604,0.0377,2.7618,0.7475,0.0352,2.1855,6.8098,12.1442,0.0422,1.2892,0.3752,4.9875,0.011,1.2774,2.9391,6.5302,0.1177,1.0814,2.6325,0.4469,0.6392,6.9055,2.4984,1.1834,8.2564,1.397,3.7111,1.3805,0.8364,13.0985,4.4903,4.3357,2.7582,3.7671,0.0008,0.0168,0.004,4.3044,0.2357,0.8897,0.4191,0.0366,13.318,11.0214,4.5716,3.7176,3.0977,2.9724,4.8035,2.6026,2.4636,1.0798,3.5875,0.4704,3.4172,4.6143,0.6002,1.6112,1.5812,0.0004,0.0212,0.038,2.9241,2.4361,4.1341,4.7522,1.6653,4.9504,1.6072,2.6067,0.8652,7.1219,2.4921,4.4894,0.0085,3.4641,0.6699,1.7418,5.3014,0.6255,6.0092,4.2387,1.9896,8.755,3.6502,2.9072,4.0029,1.6723,5.6994,1.4587,0.4035,1.2432,6.1389,3.0301,1.4825,0.078,0.0271,4.7863,0.1087,0.01,9.1314,0.4219,0.0007,1.4705,3.4406,0.3502,0.248,2.0993,1.9958,3.5148,2.812,0.8245,5.6626,0.3948,0.3633,0.2355,1.6298,1.6112,1.7571,1.0863,0.0003,0.0175,0.0273,2.0336,1.1929,3.942,0.4878,3.0098,1.3009,5.559,0.6115,5.9017,0.7264,0.7014,10.7685,9.6655,6.7547,2.4315,4.3885,3.4027,1.1778,0.729,1.2774,1.5041,0.8271,1.1599,0.9528,1.3166,1.1811,0.9941,0.7912,0.596,0.9173,4.2734,3.2123,1.0042,1.5127,3.8974,2.8052,0.4827,0.8829,6.4812,5.2472,1.6369,1.3101,0.537,2.6565,1.0207,0.4545,0.4616,0.747,3.6469,0.5389,5.1248,3.4268,1.99,7.2369,1.9964,2.378,4.4737,5.7712,3.9537,0.428,0.2372,3.1056,5.1724,0.0941,3.1669,0.2413,3.1341,0.8181,1.4555,4.1194,4.3333,1.8929,1.0152,4.1308,4.0773,3.1556,8.2687,0.9022,0.5847,2.8049,5.8574,2.5829,1.7664,2.7716,9.693,6.1087,3.7471,12.187,3.7665,0.1241,0.5798,1.8773,3.9019,2.9107,0.4557,2.6008,0.228,0.1513,1.8198,2.6714,6.4242,4.2327,2.6727,1.1906,2.9076,0.0477,2.3169,1.1967,1.025,0.4894,1.5643,1.9549,3.7264,7.4586,1.5162,2.6969,3.1978,3.5084,4.04,4.4098,0.0338,3.9988,1.0172,0.9061,2.6286,10.0958,6.7346,7.071,7.1147,2.1971,2.4102,7.8457,1.5467,1.0416,3.9373,5.867,0.4822,6.456,1.1161,3.8939,3.7224,0.0016,2.664,8.7045,7.4341,1.2911,1.5468,2.1622,3.7395,4.9603,0.2531,3.1929,10.3814,2.9013,0.8473,3.5713,1.769,1.5191,3.222,2.9305,5.4522,0.203,0.3697,0.8352,2.8966,3.6499,2.5069,0.9283,2.2659,8.5107,3.0239,0.1447,0.3702,3.8108,4.3624,1.1692,1.4354,5.529,0.4011,0.2782,0.2406,6.33,2.3809,0.1636,0.029,5.159,2.3358,1.9227,0.7766,2.8472,6.0015,8.7342,1.5275,4.1365,0.0783,0.9576,4.0395,5.9624,0.7051,2.7978,1.2954,4.9143,3.5996,4.7958,3.2403,0.064,1.2867,3.739,4.196,1.0491,0.8972,3.6271,4.3995,0.3724,2.4817,0.0014,1.1195,0.7546,1.2204,0.2672,4.85,0.3232,4.1252,6.4954,1.2516,0.1082,1.8448,0.9739,2.9453,1.7165,0.4218,0.3362,1.4596,1.1522,3.5894,1.0412,4.1552,1.0959,0.3703,5.1569,1.5385,3.7186,1.5018,1.1862,0.6614,0.0144,1.4041,1.6822,1.674,0.5172,0.6665,2.7675,3.0429,10.1965,5.1326,0.8334,5.4713,2.2682,2.896,3.9923,8.4936,4.094,0.0009,0.0037,0.0606,3.8797,7.249,0.0995,4.3177,3.7758,0.5231,1.5131,3.0249,3.1531,2.7847,1.5248,0.0346,3.4868,2.8373,4.3255,3.1841,2.0485,0.8913,5.8543,0.4416,1.902,1.0725,3.1898,0.5886,2.1093,2.799,3.8162,4.1849,0.3102,0.1146,1.3055,3.4768,3.4724,0.1067,2.0794,3.8615,5.3355,0.6619,4.2337,4.7611,1.0113,5.3754,1.6667,3.304,8.3633,1.4888,3.5631,3.488,2.2915,1.1173,5.0872,1.2135,2.5707,0.03,0.8753,0.4087,3.8443,2.2974,0.2315,1.6387,1.6562,0.0005,0.0895,0.0536,3.3443,0.2298,0.7058,2.2936,1.3079,2.1633,10.2949,1.5232,2.053,7.9836,0.5156,5.1456,0.0009,0.0,0.0634,2.1616,1.5025,1.9538,2.487,0.0081,2.7361,1.468,1.4156,0.0009,0.0041,0.0643,2.0491,4.9771,1.5525,0.6974,0.9334,3.7788,1.4572,0.0883,3.0668,5.0681,5.9901,1.0422,1.7871,3.1359,2.6055,0.2387,1.8543,2.1897,5.216,0.5776,1.3117,2.8795,0.0159,0.8473,5.8578,6.4916,4.1516,6.0608,0.0151,0.2179,6.7036,0.2278,2.129,0.0006,0.0041,0.025,7.6902,1.6139,6.0865,1.1872,5.2632,0.8982,0.2302]}
{"prompt":"Comprehensive reform of the U.S. tax code is still likely to pass by the end of 2017 despite the government spending deal President Donald Trump struck with Democrats , U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said","text":"Comprehensive reform of the U.S. tax code is still likely to pass by the end of 2017 despite the government spending deal President Donald Trump struck with Democrats, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday.\nA key sticking point of the tax bill is a sweeping provision that would cut rates for businesses so the cost of doing business increases. The deal aims not only to fix the corporate tax rate for the first time in a generation, but also to put it back where it was under former president Barack Obama in a bid to spur investment and increase U.S. economic growth.\nThe top rate would go from current 35% to 22% in 2018, 24% for 2019 and 23% in 2020 before returning to 35% in 2021. With the revenue gain, the top rate for small-business ownersthrough a 1099 form \u2014 is raised from 28% to 34% in 2018, 37% on 2019 and 39.6% in 2020 and back to 28% in 2021. These increases would start to phlase out of phase after 2023 through 2025 before the top rate reverts back to 35%, just in time for Congress to enact a tax overhaul that follows in the wake of President Trump\u2019s election win and sweeping budget reforms this year.\nMnuchin made the comments Monday night at a White House event attended by former Republican senators and congressmen as well as a number of Republicans who switched parties or will be considering leaving the party to join Democrats. Sen. Susan Collins, Mitt Romney\u2019s former vice presidential running mate, was in attendance. Collins was previously a key Republican critic of the tax bill as well as of President Trump\u2019s executive orders designed to address illegal immigration.\nMnuchin said that while some of the legislation is subject to reworking, it is in a \u201cvery good place\u201d and is \u201cabsolutely on track.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us are particularly anxious about having this year\u2019s budget bill pass,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cI really think it\u2019s been on very strong footing.

Mattis said the attack was \u201cdirected at\u201d U.S. military personnel, not civilians, and there had been no intelligence indicating the planned attacks.\nThe Pentagon said the ambush occurred in a town southeast of the Niger capital Niamey. It was planned by Islamic State, a movement that has wrought havoc in the region and is fighting a campaign against Western troops in Iraq and Syria. The movement and al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attacks on Paris and Brussels in 2016, along with a series of deadly car bombings in Niger that killed more than 200 people in October.\n\u201cThe attacks were aimed at intimidating us and targeting our own soldiers at the time of the attack, not civilians,\u201d Mattis said.\nDefense officials told CNN the attackers, suspected to be two women, had tried to cross a road near the camp when the soldiers fired in self-defense, striking them.

But he\u2019ll be best remembered for his refusal to deal with an epidemic that is driving up the numbers of infected Americans and killing young people\u201d he said. \u201cNow, a bipartisan group of senators has unveiled another legislative proposal to combat these challenges. Congress needs action now, not more talks, according to new legislation proposed by Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Chris Coons (D-Md. ), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah). \u201cIn a statement, Senator Hawley, one of the sponsors of the measure, \u201cAfter the U.S. passed the Voting Rights Act and had every indicator the next five years in office would improve voting rights, Trump changed course. He revoked DACA and rolled back protections for people brought illegally into this nation as children. They are our mothers, fathers, grandparents, uncles, aunts, friends, neighbors, classmates, brothers and sisters. \u201d In the same day, the Senate introduced legislation to expand the ability of the federal government to conduct vaccine distribution and administration studies. The bill, titled \u201cA Vaccine Planning Act of 2021,\u201d was introduced by three Democratic and three Republican senators. In a statement, \u201cThis bill would provide the foundation for the federal government to expand its ability to safely conduct clinical research and vaccine distribution during a global pandemic. In addition, the bill provides clarity and uniformity around the conduct of clinical research trials and vaccinations, with a particular focus on ensuring vaccine development, production and distribution are based on the best scientific evidence,\u201d the senator added.

{"prompt":"Luis Zelaya , the third-placed candidate in Sunday s Honduran presidential election , said on Monday that Salvador Nasralla was the country s new leader , and urged the U.S.-friendly incumbent Juan Orlando Hernandez to","text":"Luis Zelaya, the third-placed candidate in Sunday s Honduran presidential election, said on Monday that Salvador Nasralla was the country s new leader, and urged the U.S.-friendly incumbent Juan Orlando Hernandez to return to Honduras for a national assembly poll. Honduras voted for a new election amid violence during the November 3 campaign after Hernandez s bid to unseat Zelaya collapsed with the latter s return to his hometown of Esquipulas, and his supporters raiding government buildings. \u201cIt s true, he is the winner, \u201d said Zelaya, also a former president. \u201cAnd I will take my responsibilities, and we will work with our administration to send a peace plan around the world. \u201d Zelaya added that he would help Hernandez return to Honduras to oversee a recount and announce the results at a national assembly poll. However, he declined to support Hernandez s bid for reelection. The U.S.- and European Union-backed candidate Nasralla said he would accept a national assembly poll, but that he wanted Hernandez as president and that his supporters took over public buildings and government offices in Tegucigalpa on Monday. He called for the establishment of a transitional government led by his wife, Xiomara Castro, until a general election can be held in August. Nasralla and Castro say they are the legitimate president and vice president after Hernandez s withdrawal of his campaign from the run-off. \u201cI am going to be president, and my family will run the administration from (his) home, \u201d stated Nasralla, also known as the \u201cPillow President.\u201d The run-off presidential race, with only two candidates, was conducted amid a surge of hate speech, with candidates and campaign officials using insults, threats and anti-Semitic remarks. Castro, a member of Zelaya s New Liberal Party, was forced by Hernandez to step down as president, triggering accusations by the U.S.- and European Union-backed leader that she was a puppet of the opposition. Nasralla denied he wanted to return to Honduras and said he would continue to work in the United States while he waited for the results of a recount. He told Reuters in an interview that he was on his way to Washington after attending a press conference at Mexico s ambassador to Honduras. In comments that cast doubt on the validity of the presidential election, Nasralla said he would \u201cgo back to Washington and support the government that we have\u201d, but also that he would not rule out working with the U.S. military in the country as part of a U.S. peacekeeping force.","token_len":537,"entropy":[5.8515,9.482,1.4979,0.9815,2.8315,6.3314,1.6409,3.7371,4.9681,1.1642,4.9467,12.3688,15.5382,0.0777,1.0796,1.4977,0.4261,1.7801,2.18,2.3201,0.6091,7.1767,4.8609,0.1139,0.5724,2.0521,2.2524,4.8267,11.3859,4.8132,1.7479,2.046,1.934,4.5714,1.5839,4.7427,0.0024,0.1024,2.8518,6.0499,8.5862,6.0857,3.0432,1.2354,0.3504,4.1805,0.2751,2.5346,3.3622,1.3444,6.7045,6.5893,8.4286,0.7475,6.1237,6.3116,1.4155,2.1955,2.2195,5.3047,7.4401,4.3223,4.1213,0.5198,7.0207,5.5946,6.0222,6.2135,4.7455,8.1494,6.2453,0.7253,4.5116,0.0604,5.4602,0.0001,13.4624,4.4267,2.1318,7.2381,2.3785,8.8005,0.5674,4.9545,5.2296,0.8031,6.9454,1.3873,7.2907,10.2419,1.7493,4.5792,3.4775,2.9035,14.0041,4.0546,1.2592,1.3818,10.8713,6.163,7.1777,4.3998,5.1459,2.8971,2.9779,2.2636,1.8312,5.0276,1.7983,5.991,7.6705,2.6443,1.9568,0.0008,0.9021,5.9615,1.5783,1.2364,2.302,1.1328,0.8279,0.6677,2.955,2.905,2.706,4.0701,3.3642,5.1119,3.214,2.1672,3.7834,0.4696,2.96,3.0509,2.1779,7.3612,0.9853,6.7149,1.4221,6.9113,1.7308,6.5963,0.6211,0.1885,1.8801,0.5131,3.8869,10.706,0.0021,4.0629,0.4523,1.4179,1.7685,5.2036,4.5387,1.9185,0.0791,0.7989,1.9708,6.1861,1.9279,6.7077,2.7805,7.2642,1.5724,0.7176,3.8474,0.5902,2.9138,1.037,3.7319,1.3173,6.1151,0.0256,1.9947,3.9432,0.0918,7.1427,2.4506,2.1511,1.6854,1.4455,3.8549,0.9937,3.1443,2.5209,0.0007,0.0115,0.6831,6.6414,2.3504,0.2998,1.0496,0.7676,3.6404,6.6601,0.0012,0.003,3.38,1.322,1.3638,5.6887,1.5704,4.3633,0.3907,0.2574,2.2452,1.3176,2.7744,0.8102,4.8696,4.1292,5.6157,1.0138,2.6668,2.2625,2.9976,3.1699,6.2871,3.5402,5.5739,4.0947,1.7806,3.855,1.5204,1.6031,3.9777,0.0013,0.0005,0.0001,0.0011,5.114,1.2481,0.6789,2.5131,3.4428,1.2087,1.686,5.0668,0.0149,0.3293,5.629,0.436,4.2897,0.0084,3.5175,3.5784,0.8422,11.3332,5.1919,0.1858,6.9445,0.45,6.956,2.3158,5.2856,0.1199,3.267,0.2688,0.0865,1.6738,3.4948,0.4194,2.6128,0.0004,0.0012,4.577,2.8653,7.4983,0.7801,1.9442,4.1994,5.5605,5.2522,1.6125,3.7499,0.7397,4.9865,4.769,0.933,7.7057,4.9816,1.4728,1.9151,1.7213,0.9933,5.3159,0.2732,0.8146,1.1986,2.5923,0.7917,3.7095,1.9627,3.8915,0.1412,3.147,3.5939,1.5588,1.3108,4.0649,3.6,1.1846,4.5424,2.2331,6.2661,5.5629,7.8042,3.7628,0.4077,4.8217,1.8043,0.6579,0.614,6.8583,0.4689,0.0007,0.0042,1.3425,4.1224,4.9844,0.0789,2.7555,10.809,2.1341,4.798,6.4632,2.4608,6.2844,1.7764,4.8966,1.5336,3.0253,7.6583,0.0727,0.0138,6.643,3.5672,3.1844,4.3005,4.421,2.2094,0.9874,0.8281,2.9622,4.9675,6.1996,2.1306,4.6843,1.2764,7.2056,3.3836,2.6318,4.1304,7.995,4.2775,6.488,1.7804,4.3797,5.5267,1.1903,2.026,0.4186,4.7593,0.0162,1.3084,3.2165,1.5806,7.9985,1.7183,1.6595,4.367,0.0026,6.2138,0.0029,1.9821,6.2762,7.8867,0.2578,0.4814,2.1201,4.2078,4.6553,6.381,1.3361,2.1474,0.0854,2.3149,1.2127,2.6721,6.1742,4.715,3.2973,1.8151,2.8603,0.0008,0.0196,0.7663,4.0917,0.4704,0.0488,0.1508,0.1341,4.863,0.7346,3.3314,1.1754,2.1172,2.5772,0.7862,0.6895,5.4216,0.7993,3.5972,0.0005,0.0028,5.4547,4.0925,5.6129,0.6424,3.6154,0.1107,0.3372,1.9169,0.9666,0.704,1.569,3.3616,0.8267,1.9596,3.0804,1.015,2.3333,0.0161,5.2253,1.5665,6.283,0.2666,1.2395,0.9003,0.8206,1.2191,3.9916,0.7272,2.0142,3.8087,3.5081,3.0336,1.2912,0.1182,0.9825,0.5113,1.859,5.5584,1.8919,0.1164,0.2084,3.1386,3.039,4.0739,0.5388,4.6493,0.0256,2.6611,7.4275,7.8848,6.2057,1.2229,4.7188,1.2859,4.2352,5.8385,1.6418,6.6049,0.568,0.0797,1.0715,3.2762,0.0208,0.7459,3.6801,0.8998,1.0222,0.8794,0.0003,0.0032,0.6317,0.8618,1.5875,14.1988,0.8384,5.3263,1.8616,0.2564,4.8012,1.8871,4.5076,1.1322,2.9498,3.5217,4.9978,1.2229,7.9924,0.9888,4.3956,2.617,3.2502,2.8229,0.3116,0.8307,1.4145,5.3845,0.0862,4.5212,0.838,0.8382,1.2205,0.0007,0.0042,1.0651,4.4761,2.2223,1.2633,2.6936,4.293,2.9877,0.0021,1.113,3.1959,0.0043,0.0421,1.4905,3.4984,1.1178,2.3668,0.5044]}
{"prompt":"President Donald Trump has invited Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak , who is dogged by a corruption scandal being investigated in the United States , to the White House on Sept. 12 , officials from","text":"President Donald Trump has invited Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is dogged by a corruption scandal being investigated in the United States, to the White House on Sept. 12, officials from the prime minister's office said on Friday. Trump will be looking to Najib to provide reassurance that his corrupt former personal banker, Jeffrey S. Weisselberg, has been kept in Malaysia and that Najib will not give access to the bank's records.\nIn the aftermath of Hillary Clinton's campaign for President, the Democratic establishment is asking its party establishment to stop trying to push Hillary Clinton's impeachment. They say it has done nothing to change Donald Trump's chances during the election.\nIn the campaign, Hillary has not even mentioned her impeachment, while it has been a recurring theme for Trump. In fact, when he ran against John McCain, a leading opponent of Clinton, he went to great lengths to distance himself from the \" witch hunt \" against her in 2008. In fact, most of the Republican Party has come out against impeachment.\nEven Hillary's Republican allies have been pushing Clinton to apologize for the sexual assault allegation she made against a former aide, as well as other attacks he made against her. That's not helping her case against Trump. Still, Trump has been able to capitalize off the Democratic Party's desire to stop impeachment.\nIn fact, Democrats have been trying to bring impeachment charges against Trump before he even came into office. No action has been taken, despite several people on the Right saying there was enough evidence to impeach the president.\nThe problem is that the Democratic party leadership doesn't agree on what's happening in the House of Representatives. That's why they are now focusing on Trump's impeachment rather than trying to keep Clinton's impeachment away.\nThe goal now for Democrats is to find something more concrete that can help her than the Clinton phone call, and there isn't much to offer at this point, but they are going to try to find something.\nThis is why Trump was very upset when the House of Representatives voted to impeach a man they know they can't afford to lose, Michael Cohen, the former campaign chairman of Sen. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The problem with this story is that it also points out another problem with Trump's relationship with the Democratic Party, their lack of discipline and ability to accept defeat.\nThis isn't the same thing as Trump's supporters, but this is a huge problem.

In 2004, President George W. Bush pushed for a limit on how much credit risk banks were allowed to take. The Fed has resisted, arguing that it has too much flexibility under its current rules.\nBanks are concerned that such limits would force them to raise capital from shareholders or be bought out by large private equity firms, which in turn might raise questions about the way the Fed chooses to spend its dollars.\nIn April, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York proposed a limit on how much risk banks were allowed to take on with loans and derivatives on loans. One of the arguments for the limit, according to a regulatory complaint, is that such lending exposes banks to a risk of losing substantial investment funds.\nThis issue has arisen when financial institutions have borrowed to buy corporate bonds in order to support them, as they do routinely when they sell large amounts of stock in a big investment. Under so-called \" credit swaps \" the financial institutions take on credit risk by backing their purchases of bonds with an insurance company's loans.\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has said it will review all the rules set by the Federal Reserve and any other agencies in terms of how they impose limits on banks and other financial firms. This follows weeks of controversy over US regulators trying to define whether some types of derivatives are \" securities, \" or \" contracts, \" to determine how they are regulated.\nUS senators and congressional members have been pushing for an overhaul of Washington's regulations on how the Federal Reserve handles risk and how it controls how banks lend. They say that they are worried that the Fed uses monetary policy to create excessive risk in the financial system.\nAsked about the matter, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke did not go into specifics. But he said that there is not a single agency in the US government that he feels is adequately supervising the entire financial system. He also noted that, despite the fact that the Fed's rules have triggered legal complaints, it has decided to take the matter further.\n\" Given the uncertainty surrounding the financial system, it seems prudent to take additional steps to assure that banks and other participants follow a well-considered set of standards,\" Bernanke said.","token_len":538,"entropy":[9.4027,1.0052,13.2823,6.9767,3.7986,1.7023,2.1479,9.7157,5.1973,0.0229,6.8181,1.6907,4.5337,2.5559,6.7741,5.5379,10.9256,2.1455,9.0206,0.0098,6.6802,1.7335,5.7839,0.0036,5.7073,1.2666,1.7055,6.2526,0.6106,0.0415,0.027,4.2784,0.0311,8.0997,0.7117,3.8313,0.6733,0.5545,10.8148,5.2538,0.0392,0.7734,0.2338,0.0,0.0687,0.0026,0.0006,3.0904,1.6757,0.1258,5.4633,2.6159,0.7321,1.4142,2.1934,5.0948,2.0115,0.4088,3.0943,1.5657,4.0907,1.1676,5.1604,3.3265,0.1728,7.2893,0.0359,0.0002,4.9568,4.8591,6.5671,1.6659,0.4656,1.2617,4.3792,4.6142,4.2109,2.7083,3.1947,0.1311,3.4934,1.6103,3.2385,3.1114,0.7934,3.235,4.3613,0.0294,0.5565,1.7018,4.3579,1.476,0.5294,3.9655,1.8751,3.5252,5.7036,0.1626,3.5273,0.3877,0.0127,1.1228,0.0001,5.4874,1.3209,1.8993,3.911,0.5086,2.2423,0.3561,2.4543,2.7897,1.8463,3.2541,0.4265,0.0823,1.89,1.813,2.1736,2.4541,2.8938,5.8699,1.7402,1.7569,0.1805,1.7392,2.4511,2.1177,0.8792,3.9858,4.4175,2.9965,2.8314,1.0463,0.6302,0.2917,4.9406,0.184,2.1476,6.2113,0.402,3.6306,1.1683,1.7216,3.3296,0.5079,0.0676,3.4649,2.4071,4.1061,5.446,2.4964,6.3035,6.0864,1.4187,1.0758,3.8071,3.5996,1.4956,0.3641,1.8859,1.4357,3.3414,0.0087,3.7175,3.5657,5.9804,0.2001,1.395,5.0443,0.9885,1.0442,5.407,0.2603,3.3847,0.3677,5.5594,0.1685,0.3493,3.13,3.8467,0.7703,0.8991,1.6891,0.2267,3.7936,0.0102,0.7591,0.0033,4.3609,1.3166,2.2041,1.4847,1.6299,0.153,4.1515,0.714,1.644,0.2113,0.028,0.0672,1.6167,8.505,4.6793,4.2857,3.5034,5.8903,5.9595,3.3888,6.3437,1.1709,0.2432,5.3219,2.3915,1.0427,1.9687,2.9598,2.8032,0.0004,3.4718,5.9354,6.1027,1.5366,1.5773,0.1186,4.3567,3.0125,7.4701,1.2741,0.1262,2.3009,1.5826,0.6512,2.407,6.3158,5.3128,3.8237,1.3911,0.2989,5.0584,4.1126,1.0631,4.4396,3.9821,4.7936,1.1615,1.5501,4.893,3.2297,1.8214,7.6741,0.742,3.4512,2.3007,0.0032,5.1349,5.1332,1.8554,4.0175,2.9481,1.8513,8.5444,3.3096,1.6475,2.4151,4.294,1.4578,0.017,2.3461,2.4637,2.269,4.4782,4.356,2.0454,5.5348,7.9903,0.0245,0.0003,1.7814,11.8619,3.8116,2.4003,2.54,3.3925,1.3459,4.9683,0.9622,3.557,0.6346,2.5617,6.0275,2.7439,5.551,1.7158,1.9422,1.7666,4.509,5.4443,2.542,3.2967,6.4223,0.9032,0.641,1.3411,4.6088,0.0264,0.1209,0.009,0.0,0.0315,0.002,0.0093,2.4859,2.2984,1.5078,1.0286,1.821,4.2639,2.415,2.9044,5.0175,0.9601,0.484,1.8887,0.015,2.2172,4.5209,2.5883,3.9328,3.3907,6.1671,0.0431,1.5451,1.2308,6.7849,1.7401,0.181,5.3087,2.879,2.5762,0.9841,3.5074,0.4701,5.7435,6.2272,5.7605,0.0246,4.519,0.413,5.1283,3.7972,3.6717,0.0258,5.4527,3.4936,4.5035,3.3389,0.001,1.6655,1.4208,2.5812,9.4052,4.801,3.2928,0.9112,0.3533,4.9776,1.6628,0.6292,3.8633,3.2617,1.9076,3.0667,1.0535,3.0725,0.3219,0.3092,6.456,5.5216,2.6819,4.8222,3.4482,0.772,1.8656,1.9368,0.4482,4.1001,1.2848,0.1115,7.578,0.2722,4.5737,1.1407,3.9679,2.157,1.1459,0.004,2.1334,3.8181,2.898,2.4853,1.1161,3.9526,5.437,3.2921,3.6941,0.8387,3.5347,2.4838,1.4048,3.4461,1.9149,3.7474,0.3648,1.5402,2.4956,8.4828,7.3159,0.2545,0.2931,3.6993,4.3833,1.3012,2.6941,1.0616,1.8361,0.6209,0.7082,0.4446,6.7844,1.4061,0.3095,4.0977,1.5618,3.7891,0.0319,1.1315,0.0849,0.0088,0.0,5.046,0.0495,6.9975,0.3444,1.66,1.38,2.5549,0.6515,0.6224,1.037,3.8788,1.4336,5.2387,1.061,3.1513,2.9498,1.6989,0.2267,1.6914,2.4244,0.3806,5.1222,3.8512,1.2411,5.8078,4.9872,0.0038,1.0113,6.69,1.2014,0.3148,0.3418,2.7625,2.2964,3.2022,0.0779,3.9099,3.6566,0.8911,2.1566,0.0246,1.1912,1.4454,3.1381,1.6827,2.5451,6.9673,4.6782,5.8483,1.4231,2.0609,0.8256,6.4775,0.8532,2.6595,1.9361,1.3446,2.2333,0.707,0.3094,1.2682,9.6976,0.507,5.2784,2.1232,0.7051,3.2728,0.4632,0.6439,2.1745,3.9709,3.3443,1.0349,2.3953,3.2238,0.4965,0.396,5.3118,0.7899,4.0382,1.574,0.5683,6.3573,8.1183,5.1924,5.3347,0.1045,4.6651,0.0334,2.3293,0.0012,3.5074,1.479,0.8137,0.0001,0.2917,0.4692]}

They did not get it,\u201d Trump said during a telephone conversation with King Salman.\nTrump added, \u201cWhat you must realize is if that goes on for much longer you could see the very end \u2026 of the (Saudi) Kingdom.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s comments came as U.N. Security Council leaders met to discuss humanitarian restrictions in Yemen.\n\u201cRather than considering the humanitarian impact of those restrictions and trying to find a solution that can benefit all sides of this conflict, we saw Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates push and push and push to create an unbelievable blockade,\u201d U.N. acting president Samantha Power said.\nPower emphasized the Security Council\u2019s unanimous call on both sides of the war to ease the restrictions on humanitarian assistance. The calls came after the Council\u2019s top official warned on Monday that Yemen could face \u201cfood shortages, disease, starvation, and even famine if action to end the blockade isn\u2019t taken.\u201d\nThe United Arab Emirates and a coalition of Arab nations including Saudi Arabia launched a missile military campaign last month to helppple the Houthi-held government in central Yemen, which they accuse of committing war crimes and abuses.\nThe blockade, which has severely affected humanitarian operations in the country the U.N. estimates has caused the deaths of at least 7,000 people since September, is being denounced by Western countries as arbitrary and a breach of the 2015 UN Security Council resolution on Yemen.\n\u201cThe Saudi blockade remains in place and it\u2019s a serious humanitarian obstacle,\u201d said Power, who is also the U.S. UN Ambassador.\n\u201cI call on both Saudi Arabia and the coalition to stop this blockade as quickly as possible to protect humanitarian access as well as meet the demands of the UN, which is looking for clarity on what is going on, why the blockade is still in place, what is the impact of it on humanitarian agencies who are trying to meet the needs of people and which ones they would be able to resume in the future.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s comments on sanctions were the latest warning that he might seek a new approach from Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is also the top donor to the Trump campaign, which is seeking the Republican nomination for president against former Vice President Joe Biden.","token_len":538,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,6.0246,1.8622,6.8852,0.0699,4.6677,2.1856,0.3568,4.8586,5.5785,4.2068,0.4942,0.2445,1.6104,0.9602,4.1961,1.1879,1.4918,6.5519,5.6148,3.4936,7.4691,0.3251,13.43,1.1535,3.4824,2.5137,1.1343,0.0611,3.3243,2.4299,0.4837,2.7247,5.9197,0.1855,1.5019,4.8874,2.3457,2.5571,1.8895,0.5403,0.2242,0.1712,18.4092,8.6735,10.2331,1.9137,4.35,4.9785,6.7232,6.0218,6.2715,1.9041,1.981,1.9763,3.2142,5.4075,6.4002,1.8496,2.2033,6.3242,0.5679,2.4488,1.4655,2.1797,10.3511,7.7927,3.6678,0.5469,3.2009,0.4072,4.7902,2.1994,0.2291,6.4208,1.3917,1.7468,0.5913,4.3776,3.9657,2.1717,7.8435,1.8328,5.2821,2.8716,5.1742,4.9414,0.379,4.8004,5.4015,5.4899,0.5443,1.6595,4.4999,0.0321,4.1924,4.0018,2.3169,2.062,3.9988,2.7364,8.8708,2.8022,1.2468,6.9878,1.8617,0.5908,3.8159,1.7582,1.9163,2.4577,0.9869,2.2786,10.5265,7.902,3.6419,1.2802,1.5117,1.7077,3.3116,0.0006,2.5242,0.0211,3.5419,0.0052,3.8685,1.0666,1.5666,0.4884,5.1355,6.4499,2.0374,0.1339,1.4747,0.9446,1.5693,1.0839,8.4,0.1583,7.3792,2.1294,2.5197,5.0904,0.4908,5.4724,1.2481,3.0512,4.0768,0.0256,3.4209,1.0234,1.1687,3.0218,3.4723,6.1027,1.6977,3.2914,2.7692,4.6591,0.7007,0.2161,2.6351,6.9627,2.931,0.0474,1.9983,1.4271,0.8326,2.9594,0.0049,5.2161,4.7597,1.0408,1.7541,0.1711,2.4528,4.435,3.0098,7.2344,2.705,2.3723,2.7178,1.2047,5.191,0.0006,1.0406,0.0267,8.1837,5.1014,6.3237,0.0306,0.3304,1.3443,0.2135,5.4499,5.9475,1.6596,8.234,0.0008,7.1495,3.9527,0.0957,7.2754,3.9071,1.9728,5.8553,0.3643,1.1212,0.1691,3.4657,0.8554,5.2945,1.2463,1.5753,1.8108,1.4353,2.0627,1.0786,3.7307,5.792,1.6765,1.3792,1.8093,4.8227,5.476,1.2684,0.0534,4.7015,4.584,3.9754,3.7359,2.4092,0.265,3.5579,2.247,2.6181,13.7623,0.7605,7.3348,1.0228,1.2088,5.2998,1.372,2.8843,0.9972,0.5794,2.4298,2.765,1.7111,8.2272,4.2187,1.8933,0.3259,0.5137,4.5771,2.6071,3.6993,0.142,0.3051,0.3821,4.7001,1.3062,0.2689,2.7216,2.6964,2.9104,0.0076,1.8769,6.6684,2.5314,0.1002,1.6475,1.7372,3.9587,0.6036,0.006,4.6892,1.0039,5.9609,10.3986,3.0011,3.1282,1.4048,0.8059,15.4847,7.272,15.499,2.033,1.2011,0.35,3.9727,3.3427,4.9008,0.7338,5.5672,0.096,1.2472,2.552,3.424,2.4793,0.0588,3.6971,0.4271,0.0028,1.7755,5.2034,0.915,0.8768,2.3037,4.4916,2.4469,0.6637,1.3748,6.5044,2.1541,4.5451,3.3345,0.8638,1.2895,0.9322,8.14,2.0129,0.0006,2.7019,0.0295,4.081,1.4618,2.8202,4.0424,1.216,0.0819,1.7966,0.0001,3.9713,0.2192,0.8451,0.3281,2.5298,4.1936,0.7372,2.0489,3.2721,6.2804,0.3497,4.4112,2.5605,0.6916,6.2163,0.4531,3.3103,4.4866,0.008,2.4264,6.0535,1.9403,1.3332,0.0007,0.4156,2.3382,1.3558,0.4397,0.398,1.0878,0.3602,1.3941,3.5016,3.7104,5.5276,1.0676,0.9756,1.808,3.3678,5.3324,0.8029,0.0318,3.0526,3.8937,2.4159,6.974,2.2157,0.4129,0.5565,2.2208,1.4305,1.2069,1.1596,2.2889,1.7493,1.2817,1.5517,0.0007,1.3581,0.0839,7.2962,2.6486,1.3644,0.4027,0.6997,0.4663,4.363,5.247,0.2265,3.7519,3.6569,0.1197,0.0795,0.2122,6.2721,0.883,2.126,1.9962,2.8987,4.5722,1.8006,0.0562,0.0414,3.4646,4.3884,4.1957,4.0976,4.8639,1.1136,0.0438,6.6453,0.724,2.2672,0.178,0.5634,5.5271,2.0454,3.8545,1.258,5.659,1.4166,6.8491,0.6009,2.5374,1.2218,1.7527,0.0256,2.811,7.2622,1.9892,0.9431,0.492,5.2421,0.6743,0.032,0.7551,2.9958,1.6313,1.3288,4.3833,0.9715,2.0118,0.9803,2.9822,6.3562,5.5793,0.9575,2.1301,0.0351,4.2842,1.0934,0.986,0.1117,2.5792,2.7714,6.3295,5.9334,3.9187,4.9063,2.77,1.5325,0.0137,8.8611,3.7114,0.8798,0.1887,0.6981,0.7075,0.5952,0.3036,4.424,1.1408,0.1548,0.0416,0.6988,3.1564,8.3725,2.4584,2.9063,1.1433,5.2928,2.461,3.6053,3.4965,3.8104,2.9488,3.2338,2.4518,2.5729,2.7524,0.0177,1.8656,3.5466,0.0801,2.2586,3.5099,2.6755,4.2183,2.3448,0.2189,0.3872,3.6655,2.1662,0.8905,2.9854,1.9774,4.5404,3.0923,2.1602,0.8349,0.8524,0.2558,6.6938,5.186,6.6782,0.0156,1.9214,0.0032,0.6119]}
{"prompt":"Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday to tell him Moscow backs a resumption of talks between Israel and Palestinian authorities , including on the status of Jerusalem , the Kremlin","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday to tell him Moscow backs a resumption of talks between Israel and Palestinian authorities, including on the status of Jerusalem, the Kremlin has told RFE\/RL, repeating an earlier statement that no new negotiations could take place unless the international community supports them by stepping up pressure on Israel to stop violating the law of war.\n\u201cPresident Putin called President Abbas on his own initiative today and spoke about Israel\u2019s activities in Jerusalem, along the Green Line and its continued violations of the Hague Convention and the Law of War,\u201d said Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the assessment on Sunday when discussing possible dialogue with senior U.S. officials, but said the two sides did not have concrete proposals on a resumption of peace talks.\n\u201cThere is the need to set a new agenda for the implementation of previous agreements \u2026 and that is what I am planning to discuss with United States officials tomorrow at a trilateral format in Vienna,\u201d Lavrov said.\nIn Moscow, Putin said on Monday that the Palestinian and Israeli governments needed to make efforts to find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and that the international community, and particularly Russia, needed to intensify its pressure on Israel to respect the commitments that it had made under existing agreements.\nDespite the Russian announcement, many analysts have said the dialogue that Putin\u2019s government promised to initiate between Jerusalem and the West may end up breaking down entirely.\n\u201cThere are no conditions for dialogue. It is all about pressure, pressure and pressure on Israel to make sure that all the agreements that it signed are actually followed,\u201d said Yosef Katz, a senior Israeli former official who now teaches the U.N. Peace Corps Peace Negotiating class in Jerusalem.\n\u201cThe pressure could be even worse if the Palestinian Authority decides that it will not make the political concessions that it expects from this dialogue. That is why nobody expects that dialogue will lead to anything,\u201d he said.\nSince the beginning of Israel\u2019s 2014 war against Palestinians in Gaza, which killed more than 1,300 people, Palestinian violence has only increased in Gaza.\nThousands of protesters took to the streets in Gaza and other Palestinian cities calling for unity and confronting government policies in the West Bank. Palestinian suicide bombings and attacks by other militants have continued in Gaza.\nThe talks were originally planned to begin on January 6th, and then delayed for over a month after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would take time to reflect on how the talks would proceed and on whether the Palestinian Authority had fulfilled its commitments.","token_len":539,"entropy":[7.6235,1.3065,0.0036,10.7599,0.012,8.786,0.4999,0.0186,0.0011,1.9222,2.2783,1.6096,4.041,0.1725,6.5747,8.5874,2.5251,5.8925,0.0129,0.0317,1.221,3.0086,1.2279,0.0104,4.1972,3.9665,1.5789,5.0184,4.6883,1.0586,3.4717,0.006,1.6579,2.1893,2.1748,4.8372,3.9572,3.627,3.6419,2.8904,0.001,0.0,3.7158,7.6491,2.5769,1.0835,0.899,1.5091,5.6608,3.4228,2.85,3.5036,0.7204,0.0019,4.6833,1.6317,5.3443,0.0423,5.0599,3.2715,6.797,6.2115,0.2435,2.1945,0.5267,0.6145,1.8873,1.8947,6.196,0.9017,8.1638,2.4401,3.268,0.3451,0.1799,18.2949,8.1431,8.6427,1.3192,2.8085,4.7403,0.2011,1.1917,4.9333,6.3873,3.1019,4.8477,2.7646,4.6658,1.9264,4.3846,14.5105,8.5995,6.0256,7.5881,0.5818,4.3691,0.9808,7.1065,5.7991,6.8003,0.0008,2.0353,5.2177,4.9202,3.6296,0.164,1.1034,7.7037,0.8732,2.8047,1.2485,6.9197,0.0232,1.2877,1.1494,11.056,7.2164,2.642,3.8494,0.0498,0.0002,0.1873,2.1306,2.7647,0.0691,0.2295,0.5275,6.6029,0.7774,0.1132,0.8701,0.0002,5.0087,0.6802,8.4841,1.9788,3.8497,3.5443,5.3312,5.187,4.9269,1.1177,6.5007,3.7635,0.0007,0.0328,0.0132,0.2928,2.0235,3.089,1.9471,1.7658,2.6178,0.5917,3.5471,0.0267,1.6055,4.6027,3.0698,1.7573,2.3801,3.1265,0.0089,0.2016,3.21,0.2017,0.7168,0.3298,2.3542,0.5766,5.2979,0.9436,5.2032,4.2389,0.6869,4.9915,2.1912,3.7542,4.1144,1.5512,1.2248,6.3045,0.0335,7.0041,1.1059,8.2493,2.0543,3.1841,0.9395,2.1858,2.9034,2.0852,5.8183,0.9158,2.4825,0.4512,8.0431,0.3149,1.3016,4.2748,4.9444,2.177,9.3109,0.0211,7.3329,2.9272,3.9487,1.696,3.3719,1.8534,3.2827,0.3795,0.3649,0.2179,4.0678,4.6306,0.4626,3.4383,1.7452,4.2417,1.449,0.2708,1.6932,3.4677,5.1557,0.211,2.4386,5.148,0.3359,3.9027,4.3,0.2757,3.6368,0.535,1.4185,0.9738,0.2529,1.8472,0.0852,0.0081,0.0999,1.3463,1.8364,1.2529,1.7076,3.0355,0.02,4.5625,4.2392,3.9206,2.696,0.1214,2.032,0.0727,6.049,0.8807,2.4457,0.2448,0.3255,0.8729,5.2888,0.4826,7.7041,3.9247,1.7896,4.112,0.1286,3.8137,7.2383,1.1602,0.5099,0.1963,5.9976,1.1738,3.8112,3.5212,0.3565,5.4252,3.8427,2.8583,2.359,1.9457,7.9013,4.4818,3.1771,14.9602,2.6383,0.0051,1.3754,6.6552,2.1722,5.0079,3.3249,5.0538,0.0578,0.8017,1.5858,14.3668,4.7998,0.232,6.6965,0.1548,5.8327,1.0575,0.6204,2.0241,0.176,3.323,1.4941,3.2214,5.2323,1.2951,4.7574,2.4215,2.703,0.9249,4.7698,1.5087,5.8791,1.873,6.0931,2.8348,0.9495,2.4327,0.965,1.5671,4.2295,3.2234,0.356,4.3795,1.8197,3.8695,1.3497,2.2518,2.1983,1.6835,5.6059,3.8674,1.7533,0.4602,1.1039,1.5331,9.8587,0.0113,5.614,0.3741,0.6668,1.5227,2.1392,6.6811,2.8782,1.5094,2.2869,1.664,3.6856,5.701,0.0248,2.1734,0.5738,3.6857,3.3947,7.7383,7.7289,0.0656,5.0734,9.7087,2.3073,1.6322,0.1666,0.292,1.241,0.0645,1.7064,4.7064,4.9893,1.8844,3.5636,2.056,1.386,1.0922,2.2757,1.3327,3.6626,2.7881,1.1138,2.0891,0.8206,4.1395,2.451,6.7449,2.3984,1.6715,0.9664,5.6964,1.1467,7.094,7.5739,1.4246,3.7012,1.9885,2.1243,9.3003,3.5214,1.9716,7.4548,1.3431,5.0751,0.0641,5.0322,2.6834,0.3606,0.8751,2.8171,0.4153,0.1531,0.2302,6.4171,0.9961,2.4254,0.0652,4.7788,4.5655,0.846,0.0094,6.782,1.9911,2.8873,4.0918,1.8774,2.4228,0.1985,4.0847,3.179,0.9871,0.0031,2.0855,0.0877,2.4228,1.5967,0.3937,3.9464,6.1731,0.3852,5.2932,1.2111,2.2933,5.0955,1.7974,1.5826,8.0767,0.1965,5.6981,3.6041,0.1402,0.0433,0.04,1.1948,3.6915,2.9748,2.2432,1.9373,1.6875,6.2509,0.2808,5.8709,1.3439,8.5408,6.4262,2.9187,4.1087,1.3392,0.5749,0.0011,1.2822,5.3257,9.5284,2.254,1.7905,1.9441,2.3151,7.5259,3.2705,1.184,2.838,2.1255,2.4415,1.6183,0.531,2.5362,5.756,3.035,4.673,3.1373,0.553,1.4111,1.2794,4.0599,3.4764,3.9966,0.7439,3.1864,3.41,5.7512,2.4088,5.1057,0.825,0.9669,2.3343,2.7232,1.4169,0.0049,0.0589,0.0012,3.4942,1.3376,0.8329,4.8474,4.06,0.375,5.1088,0.3622,4.2318,1.6864,1.331,2.1087,1.5101,2.6766,4.2057,1.6229,1.7188,2.9188,0.4792,2.613,3.3191,0.1856,1.7703,1.0507]}

Former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Cory Booker, all Democrats, are calling for the president\u2019s successor to issue an executive order blocking QAnon, a conspiracy theory that many people have believed, for years and that they now claim makes no sense.\n\u201cIf this administration isn\u2019t going to issue an executive order and protect the lives of Americans like you and I, someone else ought to step up and make sure not only the president and his immediate family are protected, but also the life of every American like us who don\u2019t believe in this insane conspiracy that takes our government into uncharted waters,\u201d Booker wrote on Twitter.\nTrump had been hospitalized with COVID-19 after he tested positive for the virus on Election Day. He was in the intensive care unit of Walter Reed national military medical center the same day he tested positive.\nIt\u2019s not impossible, a lot of people think about taking the medicine when they are getting over a cold or having symptoms of a virus. A study recently published in the journal, Pediatrics, shows that one in six COVID-19 patients are prescribed medication to treat a cold. It\u2019s called pseudoephedrine and it has been shown to do little, if any, good.\nAccording to the study, patients who did get the medicine, didn\u2019t lose much weight more and were much less likely to get pneumonia. It\u2019s even been suggested a study funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found it didn\u2019t actually have any effect on the course of the illness. The research involved 3,000 patients, and a lot of them didn\u2019t have a fever to begin with to begin with.\nIt\u2019s not unusual for people to take medication over the counter to help with symptoms they have.

{"prompt":"A Democratic U.S . Senator from Michigan on Wednesday urged his fellow lawmakers to retain a $ 7,500 tax credit for people who buy electronic vehicles instead of eliminating it as Republicans have proposed .","text":"A Democratic U.S. Senator from Michigan on Wednesday urged his fellow lawmakers to retain a $ 7,500 tax credit for people who buy electronic vehicles instead of eliminating it as Republicans have proposed.The move would effectively repeal a subsidy that encourages electric vehicle purchases, something advocates say will push automakers away from making electric vehicles.Senator Gary Peters urged lawmakers to preserve the credit rather than eliminate it.\n\"If the tax subsidy goes away, the big auto manufacturers won't go to great pains to manufacture them,\" said Peters, a Democrat from nearby Ann Arbor. \"I believe it's better to just keep it, and hope that it will be of continued benefit.\"\nThat view was one widely shared by attendees at the Michigan Alliance to Renewable Energy's (MARE ) annual conference in the Michigan State Capitol on Monday. The organization and the legislature sponsor a program to install charging stations in Michigan roadways to encourage people to purchase electric cars, and the tax credit helps to finance the project.The tax credit was set up in 1995, and Michigan's version is modeled after a similar one in California, but it has not been renewed several times because lawmakers found other ways to fund the program.\"We're still waiting for Congress to give some sort of sign that's that there's interest in the electric vehicle industry here in the United States,\" said Bob Levey, president of MARE.\nLevey, the same year was the only person who took the plunge and bought an electric car. His car is a Nissan Leaf, driven at 50 miles per hour the longest way that he's gone before, he said.But the tax credit has been criticized frequently as it was deemed expensive, with critics suggesting that it encourages buyers to buy electric cars in states where they are less expensive, and ignores car models that are cheaper.\"They're all subsidizing the production of an electric vehicle when you can't even get a gas or a diesel car because it's so expensive,\" said former Michigan Department of Transportation spokesman John Jansen.\nIn January, lawmakers approved a measure to eliminate the tax credit, but the proposal has not yet received approval by the Governor, who has a power to veto a legislative bill.Under the new proposal, a standard credit, meant for electric vehicles that will cost $7,500 at most and be spread among car and battery manufacturers and drivers, would be phased out over five years as more fuel-efficient vehicles are made available to consumers.In a statement, General Motors, which made and uses many of the cars that would be grandfathered under the old scheme, said it will \"explore opportunities to improve the current model in order to better meet the needs of the market.\"","token_len":541,"entropy":[9.6108,5.0676,0.0824,0.0308,0.0147,2.015,1.5591,3.9743,4.1559,2.2211,3.4934,3.7078,1.9055,3.405,0.1763,7.8661,2.4034,3.7919,13.8058,2.9409,1.5836,2.8549,1.5447,0.8173,3.5779,0.9131,3.1646,6.7753,6.8689,5.9954,0.0587,11.6832,1.0352,4.5542,6.5734,2.4753,1.5509,0.2757,6.6078,3.3298,2.2595,5.5332,4.0856,2.2909,7.2559,1.2518,4.8237,5.4036,1.8854,3.1261,2.035,5.5994,6.0202,0.7243,2.5936,5.2726,2.8331,4.3921,0.0535,4.605,1.0437,0.4617,0.9444,6.6668,6.1032,0.0677,8.0862,2.1161,0.2851,4.8655,0.455,1.5579,5.3759,0.0053,1.9759,0.0736,1.2827,3.4096,10.7492,3.0678,2.786,3.4904,6.987,3.0585,0.2421,0.3589,2.7408,6.7598,6.0881,2.4343,3.5635,0.0009,4.3102,1.7895,5.1028,4.3233,0.0849,5.2221,4.431,0.9855,2.7008,0.1454,0.5838,1.5114,1.2463,0.831,8.2126,5.4338,0.0043,0.3903,0.9485,2.4287,3.3806,2.2653,0.7489,3.8847,0.749,3.8122,2.3576,2.159,3.0432,1.5585,6.3465,1.146,2.208,3.0467,1.5581,6.7008,6.0298,1.3905,2.8116,1.2486,13.1542,4.9496,2.5256,7.8756,6.8499,0.5994,0.6185,9.0989,0.4075,0.7295,5.1286,7.2808,3.3621,4.8947,1.5813,0.1311,2.1007,4.0008,0.4429,1.6317,7.0683,1.9307,1.8992,0.9951,5.2751,3.932,2.3863,0.3335,1.4428,3.1322,0.6191,3.0497,4.0885,4.6988,2.8463,6.3748,7.2656,1.9482,5.8105,1.6995,6.7302,6.6808,0.2059,1.3918,3.2309,9.4842,0.1992,2.8575,1.9793,1.9489,0.131,3.376,0.5155,2.0864,2.1793,2.2315,2.6747,5.6901,0.189,5.3348,3.5835,3.9565,1.3429,2.4051,0.402,2.7404,3.7801,0.0953,2.5934,4.8204,2.1474,1.4953,4.2663,2.1523,1.6507,4.5308,2.1944,6.4646,1.887,5.7676,0.191,1.9482,1.1217,1.7085,1.3468,2.1653,1.5511,2.2892,1.69,2.6611,3.1043,0.6835,3.5458,7.686,0.0603,4.3407,2.819,5.5481,5.1224,0.6193,0.1071,2.9752,0.7293,1.6197,2.8345,2.0993,1.839,4.1791,3.3048,0.7631,3.2363,0.0573,4.1499,5.2037,2.8743,0.0018,7.9922,2.3455,5.2045,6.1366,3.7928,0.5349,3.9275,0.746,2.5077,4.5428,0.4082,1.7222,4.4494,0.7356,1.5423,2.0606,0.0029,0.4407,0.2282,5.4876,5.7066,4.3805,0.1016,2.6818,0.3733,1.1952,0.0011,0.8157,1.7684,16.2336,0.0015,1.8242,3.1577,8.2017,4.9385,8.6201,1.992,4.0202,4.0612,2.1965,4.5948,1.8945,5.5624,2.893,6.272,1.5428,0.2807,0.7933,2.2633,4.2548,2.7792,2.8332,2.0369,3.8656,0.5608,0.921,6.3663,5.8415,4.1956,0.3174,0.3199,0.5709,7.3799,3.8305,3.765,4.2567,2.0266,1.9558,6.327,4.6014,1.7693,3.936,0.1414,0.3988,5.4608,2.5073,2.7602,0.0776,2.4084,1.3386,3.1004,7.7141,3.32,5.2208,3.1761,6.957,6.47,2.0288,3.7896,3.0724,4.468,1.2208,0.8621,4.5312,4.7028,0.1997,2.1526,2.4069,0.8033,3.4191,3.5547,1.0789,1.8327,2.1251,3.1823,0.7111,2.3249,2.1088,8.5667,7.4508,5.7323,0.6783,1.3102,3.0846,4.7378,3.9569,1.2446,4.6574,7.4429,0.0197,1.7733,4.7528,0.31,4.3089,1.1127,0.4825,5.5051,1.6175,2.8014,1.0671,2.3344,1.9296,1.2662,3.9121,2.7237,1.5278,0.6695,1.7625,3.3978,2.8442,0.3853,2.8128,1.0828,0.5037,1.0163,4.9376,1.5554,4.5217,0.0011,0.5858,3.1841,3.5572,5.1693,4.7268,0.4576,1.5823,5.3632,3.7736,0.3927,3.9379,2.8521,0.5641,3.4706,1.0213,2.6445,0.2945,0.8789,0.1055,1.6192,1.252,1.9228,4.2667,2.6469,1.6446,1.1177,2.8185,2.3448,2.3657,0.4228,6.5823,3.9118,1.2513,1.1106,5.0346,6.369,2.0978,0.8928,3.5268,4.1611,2.6067,0.7228,6.5582,0.5143,2.2813,3.0342,0.0795,2.8148,7.5165,3.0673,4.7291,8.5504,2.4329,3.2482,0.3353,2.7587,5.3435,2.3052,1.1238,2.3756,0.0245,0.3548,4.9295,3.077,4.3586,3.7019,7.4029,2.752,5.2735,5.0043,6.5334,1.4365,3.5218,6.1983,0.2494,0.5743,0.6693,1.2954,0.4962,1.5049,2.0602,0.0179,4.8467,4.4562,5.3941,0.6075,0.0694,0.6912,1.078,3.5898,1.461,1.9792,1.1922,0.3607,4.7425,2.1796,1.0658,0.6852,6.862,0.1003,3.4444,1.7982,4.4655,6.9374,7.7915,5.5517,0.383,0.2702,3.5552,2.4698,4.6674,0.5597,13.4784,0.0124,0.0,4.3844,0.1006,5.9114,5.8301,0.0545,0.4979,1.0587,2.4963,3.2033,5.9049,0.2003,4.1846,0.5133,3.4453,1.3265,4.2067,2.6607,3.8233,1.902,0.0073,3.8566,1.4504,0.9496,0.8632,0.0562,1.873,4.6331,1.0164]}

The court outlawed the Cambodia National Rescue","text":"Cambodia has canceled the diplomatic passports of some opposition members weeks after a Supreme Court ruling dissolved their political party, senior government officials said on Thursday. The court outlawed the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) on Nov. 20 and ordered it to surrender its properties. The National Assembly passed Dec. 1 a resolution that designated CNRP officials as \"enemy combatants\" following the ruling. The government said the passports of four CNRP officials who reside in the US, including three senators and a United States government official who were named in the court order, \"can not carry diplomatic privileges and they will lose the status of being members of the Cambodian Parliament and lose their official positions at the Department of Foreign Affairs, the ministry and the embassy.\"\nPrime Minister Hun Sen said in a radio interview after a recent trip that he \"looks forward... to working with the U.S. Embassy and the diplomatic representatives of the other countries\" in his capital, the country\u2019s largest city and a place of government and business.\nThe Cambodian government is trying to quell protests calling for an end to an uneasy coalition government headed by Hun Sen. Since the dissolution of the CNRP, there have been regular rallies calling for Hun Sen to step down and for the resignation of all the current cabinet.\nCNRP Deputy Chairman of Political Affairs and Law Sopheap Samphan, a former mayor in Phnom Penh, said after Hun Sen dissolved CNRP by executive order that he believes that CNRP will face a trial during the CNRP members meeting.\nSopheap said, \"If we will show a case, it will show the injustice of the decision. If we say that it is unjust, why the decision is made by the President?\", asked Sopheap Samphan, referring to president of Cambodia.\nWhile Hun Sen said the CNRP will have to comply with the court ruling and return the properties with which the party abused the people, the Prime Minister called CNRP\u2019s leaders and supporters \"idiots\" for their political activities.

{"prompt":"When the U.S. Congress returns from summer vacation on Tuesday , for the first time in years gutting Obamacare will not be the main order of business on the healthcare agenda . But leftover hard","text":"When the U.S. Congress returns from summer vacation on Tuesday, for the first time in years gutting Obamacare will not be the main order of business on the healthcare agenda. But leftover hard-line Republican efforts from last year to undo other portions of the law could reappear, as Congress returns to focus on the fight against the coronavirus and other national crises.\nThe latest iteration of a so-called House Republican plan for the nation\u2019s health law includes a repeal of a patient-loss coverage provision that helps low-income insured people avoid having to pay as much out of pocket for medical bills and a repeal of a part of the law that incentivizes health-care providers to see more patients and do more surgeries.\n\u201cAnything that would weaken the core of that law would get the \u2018strong support\u2019 from the House leadership as well,\u201d said Adam Smith, a senior health policy adviser to the House GOP last year. \u201cThe one that comes to mind on the House Health Committee is patient cost-share plans.\u201d\nRep. Ron Kind, a Florida Republican who heads the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in the past few weeks the plan has evolved as the House moves to focus more on the coronavirus pandemic. But he is not yet ready to release the final proposal.\nThe House GOP is considering its health plan for this year and beyond even as it comes under mounting pressure to pass a major new coronavirus stimulus package now. The Republican leadership is expected to release an initial proposal for such a bill this week, on the eve of President Trump\u2019s trip to the GOP National Convention. But Republicans on Monday did not mention any Trump- or coronavirus-related stimulus legislation in their health plan, which would include the president\u2019s proposed US$2 trillion relief proposal.

{"prompt":"Opposition groups quit the government of Iraq s Kurdish region on Wednesday in protest at violent unrest in which at least three people were killed , with one group saying authorities had shown a flagrant","text":"Opposition groups quit the government of Iraq s Kurdish region on Wednesday in protest at violent unrest in which at least three people were killed, with one group saying authorities had shown a flagrant disregard for human rights by executing a man whose name was unknown. Police in the provincial Kurdish capital Erbil said the man named Mansour Mohsin had been shot and killed outside his office at a local police station after an argument with relatives who claimed that he had illegally bought an SUV from an official's family. The government-run newspaper of Kurdistan in Iraq on Wednesday reported that the police had shot Mohsin seven times. An opposition group spokesman said Mohsin was not a threat to the government. \"The man was shot seven times in addition to having six other wounds,\" Mohammad Saed al-Sakkaf told Reuters. Mr Sakkaf and other opposition party members were scheduled to meet officials this afternoon. \"We will not leave until all the criminals are arrested and prosecuted because we cannot believe that a man who was only shot in the head by policemen is a criminal,\" he said. The United States has sent weapons to Kurdish forces in Iraq, the United Nations said on Thursday. The United Nations weapons inspectors have been briefed on a shipment of arms shipment that took place in July, the spokeswoman for the UN's weapons inspectors said. The shipment which included two US-made anti-aircraft missiles as well as military clothing and ammunition was said to be meant for the Iraqi army and its ally the Peshmerga. It is the first time in the last year that US-supplied weapons have taken to the air in Iraq since the US troop pullout and withdrawal of all NATO troops from the country. Mr John Bolton, the US national security adviser, did not say on Thursday whether Mr Pompeo had requested that action. \"We have a standing request from the President of the United States that we ensure that all weapons shipments that leave either the port of Cherbourg or Bremerhaven that are destined for Kurdish forces in north Irak reach there without incident and without delay,\" Mr Bolton told reporters aboard a flight to the Philippines.

{"prompt":"German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said there was no place for anti-Semitism in Germany after demonstrators angered by U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel burned Israeli flags","text":"German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said there was no place for anti-Semitism in Germany after demonstrators angered by U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel burned Israeli flags.\nTrump on Thursday night declared the Israeli capital of Israel officially as Jerusalem, saying it belongs in Israel.\nMaas said the government could not approve an offer if a particular person wanted to take an anti-Semitic stand.\n\"There is no place for anti-Semitism in German society,\" he told a press conference on Friday.\nIsrael's foreign ministry called the decision \"useless provocations\" which are \"completely against the values in which people of goodwill live.\"\nThe foreign ministry also called Trump a \"mentally defective individual\" who has no right to talk as president - and accused him of taking the country further away from the peace process.\nTrump said he planned to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday.\nNetanyahu and Trump were scheduled to meet in New York for the United Nations World Health Assembly, but the meeting was canceled amid a flurry of diplomatic reactions.\nThe move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital came after Trump took office last year and was greeted with a storm of criticism from other countries, including many in the European Union.\nIn response to the declaration, the European Parliament voted to express its serious concern over the move, calling for its \"suspension and reversal.\"\nU.S. ambassador to Israel David Friedman, speaking at the conference a day after the decision, said Trump's choice to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel did not change that city's status.\n\"It doesn\u2019t change Israel's status as an occupation,\" Friedman told the conference, adding that the city was still subject to Israeli military occupation.\nFriedman said Trump's decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel should be \"looked at with the same cynical skepticism and critical eyes\" it has received elsewhere.\nFriedman said that the only question is whether the West will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, noting that the West has not recognized Jerusalem or any other Israeli city.\nWhile calling for the West to recognize Jerusalem, Friedman said the decision \"needs to be handled with care and respect\" to avoid a reappearance of unilateralism.\nNetanyahu's office said Friday that Trump's decision would not affect Netanyahu's meetings with him

{"prompt":"Pope Francis had an emotional meeting with Muslim refugees from Myanmar in Bangladesh on Friday and used the word Rohingya to describe them for the first time on his Asian trip , calling for them","text":"Pope Francis had an emotional meeting with Muslim refugees from Myanmar in Bangladesh on Friday and used the word Rohingya to describe them for the first time on his Asian trip, calling for them to be recognized as refugees and not terrorists.\nThe Syrian refugee problem has dominated a long line of European governments' agendas for the last decade, and there is growing frustration in Europe over the sluggishness of the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, in finding suitable housing and treatment for the migrants.\nThe refugee crisis has shocked a continent that has tried to hide its failure as ever. Weeks after an horrific sinking on its beaches, the EU has promised some 1.5 million Euros for emergency assistance, for example, including shelter that can hold up to 1,000 people.\nThe EU has a mandate for humanitarian aid and international law gives it the right to rescue people from the sea. However, as long as there is a crisis, the mandate is not enforceable. The EU can only act when a country requests it.\n\"At this crisis moment, the EU cannot act on its own. It has to engage with the UN's refugee agency. That's why we think the call from Ursula von der Leyen should be heeded,\" says John Lundberg, a professor at Lund University in Sweden.\nThe crisis has shocked a continent that has tried to hide its failure as ever. There is the widely debated case of Hungary, which has said that it will close its borders. But it has done nothing. And as a result, the country now has nearly 300,000 refugees in its borders.\nIn Germany, chancellor Angela Merkel said that Europe should take up the asylum crisis, but there remains widespread indifference and scepticism in the EU over whether it wants to deal with the problem, according to the Guardian. In France both the President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel have come under pressure from their own parties amidst criticism of their handling of the crisis.\nFrance, according to reports, has allowed a few dozen Syrian refugees in Calais to be transported to other parts of the country, or to other European countries.\nA member of the European Parliament, the Dutch MEP Sander Loones, said: \"Some governments are in a hurry to send refugees to Turkey despite the fact that the countries of the EU have agreed not to accept more migrants.\"\nThere is also growing scepticism in the EU about whether it wants to deal with the problem. There are calls for a deal with Turkey where Europe would allow a temporary landing site for refugees from Turkey to be used as a transit stop for others.

The web server has to run a virtual copy of the environment on it and in case of failure something is going to fail on the production environment and this will affect your code as well, and it is important to be able to reproduce the failure as it could be a test of different parts of the application.\nIt could work well in a web environment if you can have something like a staging server (like using an image of the production site as the content) but what about the case where you have some code that you cannot test on your staging server?\nYou can run this test on the production and see the results in the console, but this takes time to happen and is not a good experience from a user perspective. So the idea is to make it happen faster.","token_len":543,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,11.7229,8.1085,7.4978,7.8541,9.5146,10.3426,7.9451,3.5295,6.7362,2.3386,0.0274,2.9368,0.6723,5.6686,1.177,0.1442,1.952,0.0002,0.0086,0.004,2.2403,0.0017,1.3202,1.8099,1.5749,8.0923,3.6536,1.2008,4.9815,16.4394,0.4657,3.3447,5.5673,1.9758,0.9632,4.5443,4.9053,0.5803,0.6802,3.9573,10.1981,6.6359,1.8558,6.2598,3.8439,0.1127,0.1457,3.6883,8.0283,5.7906,2.525,3.6576,5.173,3.2268,4.1287,2.9702,0.0268,3.4971,3.7645,10.714,4.915,11.0137,9.6259,6.426,6.8492,5.7184,6.2655,3.2223,3.6053,6.5793,6.1574,1.5664,4.1462,4.9117,2.4683,2.886,4.3198,3.756,0.0327,3.7552,5.6022,3.6454,2.5214,7.4486,6.2143,9.028,7.1969,2.2102,2.2967,0.4092,1.0798,5.2983,0.0705,6.5755,2.4856,2.2722,3.7514,6.7486,1.0225,4.4671,3.8786,4.3736,5.9178,5.2723,5.1339,3.0426,6.5069,2.7023,4.3954,4.3155,1.3725,6.1516,0.1036,5.7284,1.3507,2.8753,2.2004,5.5407,4.9422,7.3687,6.7878,6.6514,4.2116,1.8531,5.5163,4.71,1.8402,5.6583,7.6274,4.1498,1.516,6.0798,1.9966,0.6477,3.9157,7.113,5.2387,8.5321,6.4209,1.7529,1.7805,2.3643,3.1522,0.4429,1.235,8.9207,6.4079,4.7241,5.4749,0.1051,0.1562,1.5066,2.0816,1.4791,2.6567,3.5509,5.5278,2.9999,6.2774,0.1297,0.3108,0.4832,0.0177,3.5417,4.1608,6.0376,0.8733,2.1908,2.1888,1.215,6.8405,14.274,3.7287,6.6539,4.6001,4.3522,0.9948,4.9147,0.3833,4.0449,3.9451,5.9747,6.6037,3.7703,12.5337,8.3672,3.5148,3.2118,4.273,3.1084,2.4075,0.9645,1.3737,3.8922,1.4523,2.8615,5.8691,5.8865,4.9429,2.8577,1.5459,4.8946,4.3202,10.6295,1.2044,2.6888,2.1655,4.2177,4.4846,1.8858,3.1718,4.6469,0.1097,0.0198,4.8166,2.2511,2.456,1.3898,0.1977,2.6258,3.9091,5.043,1.0184,0.946,2.7946,4.4717,11.8225,4.6317,6.4435,1.4397,5.286,2.7099,4.9438,0.974,6.2518,7.7684,3.633,5.908,1.2792,1.3227,1.685,0.2251,0.773,6.2628,10.3177,6.0403,3.3207,4.9845,0.6899,1.5492,0.0601,1.7227,6.3175,0.1634,4.9943,2.7828,5.6363,0.935,1.0951,1.4702,1.9688,0.2727,0.3215,8.017,6.2591,5.7358,8.2088,5.1076,4.3015,6.4274,0.7414,1.7741,1.7672,2.9567,3.8351,0.1502,5.352,0.0858,5.9626,4.2077,4.3194,3.8051,1.5892,1.703,2.1175,0.9629,2.4113,2.6007,0.9082,0.1234,7.9946,1.3847,1.8676,2.1564,2.3297,1.1396,0.6335,0.8899,10.6294,3.6466,3.3195,4.6528,0.1432,0.0271,2.7722,0.8189,2.6703,2.9214,2.5076,2.5651,3.0915,0.2943,0.6132,0.7068,1.7811,2.9014,4.3128,4.4542,3.82,0.6792,0.2593,0.3845,0.0793,0.0829,0.0334,6.093,10.495,2.3384,1.2344,0.8646,0.1287,0.4773,0.4006,4.9452,4.4797,5.1864,2.3591,4.7951,2.3543,4.4345,0.7233,2.474,0.0639,0.5214,0.7906,0.0493,1.1277,0.1962,4.7772,4.807,2.2819,2.9154,0.4273,0.1083,4.2167,0.1944,3.601,9.4923,1.9178,3.3232,11.1688,5.8023,3.089,2.4246,2.3455,0.8992,9.0336,4.167,4.2762,8.4609,4.6726,3.4282,6.8754,3.4378,2.4316,3.7954,2.47,4.2064,4.5542,1.6896,0.4966,2.9036,6.0235,0.8343,2.3728,2.6686,3.3257,0.0912,3.1104,2.3118,2.9702,3.1906,5.8511,7.5662,0.085,0.9583,6.8506,3.2187,4.1025,2.6069,4.7046,3.4152,1.366,3.348,7.1937,2.7343,2.1245,0.5366,3.3441,2.7898,1.0564,0.2036,6.071,3.0521,4.383,2.7314,4.3774,2.3632,5.1224,4.4107,0.3337,3.464,2.9809,3.0686,2.0461,3.6359,0.6312,3.2896,0.8255,0.018,4.5204,1.5159,2.32,3.2201,3.4949,6.0898,2.1006,2.2034,5.4721,2.3771,7.3095,3.7863,0.1492,1.0277,3.5578,0.8428,2.3009,4.3041,4.3663,5.1515,3.6549,2.6599,2.5776,4.7725,2.4826,3.2967,1.0177,2.6494,4.4637,5.3081,1.3046,1.7143,5.6929,1.2609,3.0182,1.2397,5.8427,4.0678,4.848,3.607,1.5181,2.4179,3.8376,2.7904,2.1691,6.5577,1.6247,2.4019,5.1495,2.1328,2.1514,7.9329,0.7335,1.0376,1.2455,3.6905,3.7713,1.0116,1.8939,4.7567,2.4678,2.1612,2.0359,3.1276,0.1378,1.1518,1.2062,2.7855,1.3491,3.6765,3.4141,2.0381,1.149,1.8257,0.5543,5.7323,3.9206,2.6796,1.768,3.176,1.4712,3.7919,2.0825,1.1769,3.6363,6.3828,1.7544,2.7046,6.9428,1.8539,3.5609,1.2061,2.0397,1.3748,3.9374,6.538,1.0416,5.2874,1.4109,0.4613,3.1345,2.9135,4.5516,0.6909,0.5574,2.6444,1.8495,3.8005,3.5015,1.9234]}

{"prompt":"Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has pulled back from a threat to close a human rights group founded by the detained opposition leader Kem Sokha , a pro-government website said on Saturday . The move","text":"Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has pulled back from a threat to close a human rights group founded by the detained opposition leader Kem Sokha, a pro-government website said on Saturday. The move by Hun Sen, the junta-installed chief of state, is seen by analysts as a concession in response to growing protests in the southern province of Ratanakiri. Kem Sokha leads a group known as the National Resistance Movement after his prison sentence for \"inciting people to revolt.\" The pro-democracy group is in the midst of a mass civil disobedience campaign and has mobilised hundreds of thousands of Cambodians. \"We don't agree with the Prime Minister's decision on the situation with Kem Sokha, but on the other hand it is not a bad idea to talk to him,\" said Chan Sophara, head of the anti-opposition Cambodia Reform Association. The website also quoted Hun Sen saying that he was not going to close the opposition group's office. Hun Sen announced in December that Kem Sokha, leader of Ratanakiri opposition grouping the Democratic Party, would be barred from travelling abroad for three years and also face legal charges. The ban was met by pro-democracy protesters with thousands showing up at Kem Sokha's Ratanakiri office calling for his release and the reinstatement of a ban on his movement. On Friday, a group of pro-democracy activists was detained in Ratanakiri, as soldiers and police closed and locked down the offices of five pro-democracy groups. The website said the pro-Junta opposition People's Alliance Against Dictatorship was also threatened with closure and said its leaders had been summoned to the prime minister's Office for questioning. The group described the summons and threats from the junta as \"extortion attempts.\" In a statement, Kem Sokha's spokesman Phuthuth Heng, said the groups were acting in violation of the country's laws and constitution, and urged Hun Sen to \"be fair and impartial\". He also said many of the groups were supported by foreign groups, while some were supported by Hun Sen's government. But Phuthuth Heng said it had remained unclear whether or not the summons were related to the anti-opposition campaign, even after two days of demonstrations in Ratanakiri. According to Phuthuth Heng, Kem Sokha and the other detainees had been summoned to provide their statements to the prime minister's office, and then released later on Friday afternoon, but the exact nature of their interrogations was unclear. The website also said the prime minister had instructed \"appropriate legal procedures\" when handling a public protest and a \"political party group\" calling for legal reforms.","token_len":543,"entropy":[8.8917,1.6513,2.253,5.7987,0.0223,3.4148,0.0753,2.9416,7.5022,2.5327,1.2468,1.7916,7.0784,0.3028,4.6829,2.1254,8.194,0.3791,4.4928,8.3101,0.4833,2.5084,8.3808,4.8726,0.2586,8.1467,7.18,5.3685,1.8414,3.1119,6.9648,0.0049,2.7308,5.4825,1.0378,1.0262,1.9615,0.0886,4.1565,4.1739,3.3631,2.558,0.1656,2.5936,2.3501,9.9737,0.0228,3.0616,4.0593,4.1477,0.692,3.4085,0.7433,2.4287,2.4393,1.6044,3.2578,0.0958,0.6326,5.2627,4.4281,6.8353,0.0036,4.1421,3.9713,1.9304,1.0377,4.7218,1.448,0.7892,8.8907,2.316,4.0855,7.6784,0.8752,7.9833,0.0077,0.0004,8.9894,1.6186,2.4384,3.4111,0.1216,0.5275,3.9387,5.3262,1.1351,6.6961,1.8635,6.9343,1.3817,1.257,4.0822,3.8389,0.091,4.3347,0.5412,2.8936,2.5414,2.0793,5.2448,0.0025,3.3627,0.9184,2.7461,4.6794,1.8535,2.0176,0.0014,0.7984,4.4296,5.391,0.3192,1.8454,3.4533,1.258,7.0488,0.0397,3.1735,0.0692,0.4357,0.1781,9.2871,0.2122,2.3367,3.5917,2.1496,3.6116,0.0005,4.7872,0.1246,1.1693,5.7299,0.005,0.5163,1.1387,3.9921,1.4738,4.1933,4.5448,2.7354,0.0246,0.0004,2.1502,0.8492,5.9534,0.7918,4.7121,0.0545,3.2507,1.0137,2.9997,1.7511,3.3452,3.4462,1.0996,6.0753,1.937,0.8202,1.456,1.1258,7.9124,9.8734,7.5465,0.2674,2.7963,0.0027,0.4857,4.0813,0.0024,4.6965,0.2438,4.1893,7.3335,3.0287,0.6698,2.3308,4.0085,3.1447,3.1766,2.4456,0.0027,3.0739,1.4237,1.5211,1.998,2.4852,3.0321,0.0288,2.9842,0.3343,4.8464,0.7097,3.6258,3.2786,1.6279,3.2981,0.001,5.8661,2.5603,3.0849,0.396,6.4883,0.0008,0.0003,2.4545,4.401,0.013,8.0928,0.001,0.0009,0.0024,5.6283,7.1555,2.9269,3.6605,1.6575,1.5765,0.5674,0.8644,4.9603,0.023,6.7189,3.2334,2.1396,3.011,0.6836,2.5623,5.3889,5.3706,4.83,2.5798,1.5871,1.6135,5.4356,1.6922,5.3916,2.5253,6.9747,0.0017,0.9867,1.8688,4.7199,4.0846,7.3319,0.0987,1.7834,3.9636,0.0035,0.0006,0.031,10.7538,0.0012,0.0028,0.0031,3.223,6.5001,0.3073,0.8503,0.5505,3.0837,3.1106,6.4506,0.0067,0.0135,3.0841,4.381,0.143,2.0054,3.4291,0.5714,4.426,1.7838,0.2086,2.609,2.4582,0.3246,2.7488,0.001,0.9456,0.8624,4.1762,1.9893,1.2318,2.5404,0.0015,0.0024,0.0016,1.7544,5.699,8.7662,2.5888,0.935,5.6424,7.3354,4.9636,2.1044,1.0489,2.9012,0.3938,7.6976,2.1392,0.0012,0.6537,0.7916,1.1019,1.5026,6.3892,1.2024,1.2115,4.1423,0.0015,6.0274,2.4457,3.9451,8.3362,0.0322,4.4157,6.6387,5.545,0.4552,0.0158,0.0129,2.3098,2.2647,5.2399,1.3069,3.6856,2.774,4.2926,3.5565,2.9408,1.7447,0.8364,5.2924,0.79,1.6639,5.9617,0.0709,0.0148,8.2434,2.0768,2.2125,0.3164,1.3893,2.5412,6.495,1.5727,8.249,4.0451,3.9296,5.5947,1.1258,4.6572,0.0001,0.4002,0.8559,5.5865,2.6704,4.6468,1.456,3.856,1.2749,0.5655,0.8917,3.3699,0.0007,0.0006,1.1539,2.8169,6.5676,5.3992,8.1297,5.3893,3.3028,4.3904,1.4216,1.0551,6.5362,1.33,5.107,1.3389,4.4537,0.0067,0.9391,2.7659,0.024,3.0214,0.8639,6.4815,2.0662,1.4674,2.6538,3.2682,0.0015,0.2183,2.1907,5.1527,4.6524,0.6708,2.8849,2.8644,2.141,2.0748,0.9027,7.0738,0.8618,0.2818,1.1368,1.4301,6.0309,0.1107,4.4506,4.4578,1.6375,4.0247,2.7384,1.2948,3.24,0.1369,2.7803,0.0169,0.5182,2.6126,0.2693,5.1077,4.7332,0.0007,0.0011,0.6042,0.0004,0.5425,3.7112,3.7109,6.261,0.6801,1.1699,4.7341,0.0281,0.8857,9.1559,3.1793,3.6027,0.0668,1.0002,4.2421,0.0006,2.1676,0.0063,3.3153,2.5258,5.3007,2.8009,4.8505,2.6899,0.2298,2.649,1.8426,0.9375,0.0012,0.0024,0.0012,0.5987,5.859,0.0007,3.0596,0.0004,0.0002,0.0224,0.0003,0.1096,2.2093,0.0012,0.0008,3.2452,1.2122,2.1866,7.1521,2.0096,1.2269,3.3174,0.9704,7.5806,3.2986,2.6387,1.5604,0.7597,2.0019,0.0098,0.817,0.086,1.4035,1.5928,4.2261,4.2712,5.1416,1.7795,1.3538,3.8543,2.3754,1.8152,1.8996,6.878,1.5836,0.0259,1.2903,6.8098,0.0147,2.0599,2.1283,0.1215,1.7415,3.6746,2.3242,0.9007,1.2639,6.1899,0.0057,1.6346,4.0956,5.7219,7.6517,5.019,4.4148,0.6237,4.8614,7.2879,3.9957,4.8401,3.2031,3.2829,4.2574,3.0016,4.7607,4.1348,6.0371,0.5166,7.4394,0.2331,6.5863,2.991,0.7303]}
{"prompt":"Jordan s King Abdullah on Wednesday rejected any attempt to change the status of Jerusalem or its holy sites , and said peace would not come to the region without a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian","text":"Jordan s King Abdullah on Wednesday rejected any attempt to change the status of Jerusalem or its holy sites, and said peace would not come to the region without a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Asked directly about reports in the Sunday Times by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that suggested Jerusalem would be a part of any eventual Palestinian state, King Abdullah said he was \u201ccommitted and convinced\u201d that \u201cnever again will we allow any country\u2019s decision to change the status of Jerusalem\u201d. \u201cEvery attempt to change the status of Jerusalem or any of its holy sites is rejected,\u201d he told the Jordan Times. He said the Palestinian leadership would be doing the \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Palestinian communities if it agreed to anything that could affect the status of any of Jerusalem, Al-Quds or its holy sites. \u201cI assure the Palestinian leadership that it is committing a mistake that it will regret for generations \u2026 and that the situation will not go back to the status quo.\u201d\nThe King is aware of reports that the Israelis will be giving special treatment to Israelis who will help rebuild Gaza. The King knows that many Americans have supported a bombing campaign that would have destroyed Hamas\u2019 ability to rebuild Gaza, but they\u2019re not going to be able to support that kind of campaign in a war with Iran because of the damage it would do to international efforts to keep out weapons of mass destruction. The same goes for the Israeli campaign in Gaza.\nHe is also aware that he and his cabinet have had to fight against an unusually vicious media on many occasions, including an attempted coup attempt against his government in 2010. The King is not in a position where he can just wave a magic wand and erase all of that, and the American Government that supports Israel has not taken a position in the same way.\nThe American government and administration needs to support the King of Jordan for the good of its relations with the region as a whole. It needs to take a stand on the issue of Palestine, since it has done nothing to help advance peace in the recent years, and it need to take a stand on Israel, since Netanyahu has not taken any steps that really help those in the Palestinian community or those in the region as a whole.\nSolar water heating is the heating of hot water for domestic purposes on a solar heat system.

A number of factors like temperature of water, volume of water being heated, quality of water, and geographical area affect the type and size solar heating system required.","token_len":543,"entropy":[8.1137,9.8359,4.1168,4.0543,3.8076,8.2723,3.1338,2.8297,0.5981,4.0,0.6706,3.4792,2.2197,4.7374,4.8335,2.8011,3.7645,0.4977,1.5724,2.7008,1.6593,5.6343,2.7641,2.2991,2.5714,3.2935,0.9998,3.1041,2.5623,1.7503,4.432,2.2575,0.3432,2.0881,0.0521,0.0216,0.0539,0.1635,8.4345,5.385,1.9945,4.3842,4.2857,0.7893,5.8277,0.471,5.1661,5.5735,0.0062,0.0425,0.0007,0.4514,11.9658,3.4335,2.0331,0.679,3.9774,3.6221,0.0025,4.6871,5.7557,2.4314,0.2659,0.1964,1.7483,0.0144,0.4675,2.0945,1.4758,14.9354,5.6087,6.7322,0.1266,4.7314,4.7049,2.8517,7.7932,1.6745,5.3387,1.5583,7.1514,3.667,3.6896,2.8119,3.8875,2.0722,4.1143,3.8884,5.9085,4.2842,3.5987,0.6177,3.1601,0.8879,0.0874,0.2078,0.8972,1.9194,5.2229,1.4548,3.8418,0.3588,8.8425,5.6173,0.7195,0.8446,0.5468,0.0474,0.152,0.2129,2.842,1.1984,1.3345,0.3604,0.423,0.0399,2.1995,5.8306,2.7848,3.8643,2.0894,1.2083,3.2203,1.1948,7.4252,3.0877,0.7385,3.1283,1.4974,1.726,2.5773,2.6928,2.0001,3.004,6.0868,2.4506,12.0185,0.8917,7.9246,2.2979,1.5701,3.8568,0.1641,1.3872,1.6198,4.1713,4.4758,2.8616,1.1189,5.2807,0.2054,5.8696,1.6945,2.6967,4.5486,0.9658,0.5731,0.1129,3.9869,1.3133,3.5112,3.9806,7.1956,0.3993,2.3719,0.0385,1.0878,3.8048,1.1776,0.0418,0.2698,2.1134,0.1985,3.1184,6.1424,3.2648,1.6314,0.818,0.4528,3.3725,1.703,6.7716,2.7245,5.6192,3.8565,2.7738,1.4098,5.7304,1.9148,3.6411,7.917,2.0009,1.1845,2.2095,4.8697,1.4121,1.1665,4.3672,1.3351,0.2168,0.929,2.4161,0.6719,1.7598,0.9759,1.8035,1.9631,7.862,2.4566,5.1069,5.4664,0.7838,3.8113,0.7862,1.7781,5.4756,3.0607,3.3324,5.0251,5.194,1.8,0.067,5.5028,1.6069,5.5545,6.3752,4.2858,4.2288,1.9471,2.2565,1.3627,6.8062,0.4775,3.4987,5.7146,2.5962,5.2653,3.3046,7.3246,0.179,2.9824,3.5883,1.1505,2.2822,3.223,9.7398,3.0909,10.6095,0.0285,2.5402,1.5433,1.7995,1.9014,4.5237,5.9636,2.0534,3.0693,1.0674,2.3681,0.0428,3.1506,2.0973,0.034,4.1732,2.8152,4.0858,0.0042,3.444,2.7681,2.5267,3.0952,2.9599,3.4294,3.985,1.3752,0.8113,6.0447,1.588,0.678,0.8821,0.2765,5.9474,4.247,0.3471,4.4837,5.294,7.4938,0.2805,0.0323,0.006,0.6492,1.87,6.2966,2.3571,0.0326,1.1438,3.2521,4.8056,2.0076,1.3942,1.2205,1.4785,5.3625,2.1836,1.4222,0.1785,0.6678,4.3495,3.2963,1.394,3.9125,1.8469,4.6311,1.0675,4.7905,3.6631,3.2099,8.2936,5.1173,5.0434,7.5616,4.0642,0.7765,1.747,1.966,4.2931,5.4572,2.1729,2.512,2.0684,2.1631,1.8193,1.1133,3.8947,0.9667,2.0073,1.5624,1.8255,2.9901,3.6838,1.1439,0.2336,4.1221,0.4271,1.3125,4.5027,7.2806,1.3481,1.6402,0.0168,0.8812,7.8539,2.119,1.604,2.5626,2.9676,1.896,2.8484,4.6535,6.2771,6.0519,4.4977,2.9501,2.5109,2.8212,4.2189,2.7653,2.5448,3.8583,1.8548,4.9862,0.4554,0.3653,0.9722,1.4843,4.1625,2.715,3.6121,6.6548,6.4347,0.0966,5.5771,1.1702,3.4164,5.6605,0.3536,4.7148,1.5549,4.5617,0.0956,4.0919,5.6662,0.0569,0.8603,3.1067,4.3824,2.1831,0.0161,0.7522,2.8485,1.6859,0.2203,3.7657,1.6229,1.4644,2.0066,0.9726,2.2859,0.546,2.8807,1.666,6.8801,1.5472,1.9126,4.0179,2.365,0.7386,2.1345,6.0046,1.7255,2.0792,0.3169,7.8198,2.0253,2.4569,0.7923,1.3026,5.3282,0.6951,1.9408,0.4023,0.5562,0.4209,3.7454,2.5987,0.8359,5.8199,1.1989,2.8461,2.6042,2.1268,2.0254,2.9479,6.9169,1.8197,5.309,2.0301,1.0884,4.0754,3.3998,4.8045,2.8529,0.7922,0.5479,3.7503,3.6302,0.1158,0.0011,0.2045,0.8476,14.366,7.4559,5.5317,2.0538,2.9271,9.3287,1.814,7.3677,1.3081,3.092,6.231,2.8094,5.4803,1.94,5.3381,6.2081,2.9977,0.8699,7.7368,5.6916,0.0442,1.8938,4.7995,6.7025,0.486,7.196,5.1175,3.0004,3.3579,1.0704,3.8143,3.7766,0.0079,3.7802,0.9764,4.4908,1.1925,3.0524,0.7793,0.0027,2.6047,1.2923,2.2219,2.1861,6.1559,4.1626,0.538,3.8106,3.5903,0.478,4.0696,3.3343,0.0095,6.1859,6.7164,3.4972,4.7524,2.7636,1.205,5.2882,0.5921,0.3909,4.7331,3.0696,0.3941,6.2736,0.1402,0.9795,1.4644,0.913,7.4805,3.2147,3.6987,0.6234,4.9646,2.2945,2.5215,12.2097,2.1401,1.2173,6.3469,0.8056]}
{"prompt":"Iran s allies in Lebanon have emerged even stronger from a crisis triggered by Saudi Arabia , which achieved little more than to force the Saudis main Lebanese ally - Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri -","text":"Iran s allies in Lebanon have emerged even stronger from a crisis triggered by Saudi Arabia, which achieved little more than to force the Saudis main Lebanese ally - Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri - back by months into hiding.\nLebanon is already struggling to stem a tide of internal discontent linked to the Syrian civil war, unemployment and the rising cost of living. So the international outcry has come as a relief, and may actually help in the long term. It is not only Saudi Arabia and its allies (particularly the Syrian regime ) who appear to need reassuring after last month's storming of the embassy, but Lebanon itself in a tight economic spot.\nThis has led to calls by Hezbollah, a Sunni Islamist party, for Lebanon to return the Saudi Embassy to Riyadh, in defiance of the demands of Iran and its Saudis backers in Lebanon. And Hassan Nasrallah's response on January 18 was, in effect, \"to go and come back when you like\".\nThe Saudis and other foreign allies of President Michel Aoun have now got the message. The government of Lebanon, which has suffered two military defeats by Hezbollah in recent years - and a recent coup, which has meant that no government has been able to function effectively since May 2017 - may turn to Russia and Iran for more help.\nBut this would risk alienating Saudi Arabia, and could in turn be misinterpreted as the Saudis trying to weaken its allies in Beirut. It could also risk undermining the international confidence that is needed to drive reconstruction efforts in Lebanon.\nThe Saudi-led rebellion of the past month has been the most brutal confrontation since Lebanon returned to democracy five years ago. The rebels attacked Saudi diplomats and the Embassy. Two Saudi diplomats, including the Ambassador, were killed.\n\" The Kingdom has been defending the sanctity, dignity and identity of the Embassy in Lebanon since it was opened. It's natural that the Saudi and their supporters should defend the Embassy,\" said the Saudi ambassador to Lebanon, Hossein Amir Abdollahian.\nHe added that the events in Lebanon had nothing to do with Saudi Arabia and its allies in Lebanon, with whom the Saudi Embassy in Beirut had always acted in full accordance with diplomatic protocol in its relations with the Lebanese government.\n\"He is very close to the Iranian regime which is itself a very dangerous regime in the region.

The statistics are not the same as the annual number of people who receive the diagnosis due to testing differences.","token_len":544,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.3359,3.6651,0.0009,2.9653,0.0027,2.9206,2.5764,9.5966,0.4779,3.6437,2.6026,3.3084,2.1723,6.5831,0.0502,1.3761,0.6102,0.1251,2.0046,6.2042,7.8261,2.2498,0.5127,4.2688,11.0261,0.5138,1.5008,6.9324,2.8914,7.2336,0.0641,1.1713,0.0443,0.6376,5.8499,2.179,4.7319,2.9109,4.102,0.7425,2.2226,5.5192,0.5043,1.6301,4.4404,0.6027,4.9148,1.8016,2.2585,1.5852,5.2752,3.0216,4.2443,0.1235,1.2688,0.987,1.8746,5.738,6.4595,0.5183,4.4384,0.4647,1.7599,1.7678,6.1785,0.0025,1.7675,0.1722,0.1648,7.2018,1.6592,6.4116,2.4179,2.454,1.7622,3.4522,15.3855,5.7688,6.4716,2.1453,5.4654,0.0124,17.0289,8.0066,9.2848,0.3075,18.1498,10.7617,0.0651,5.2422,6.2865,0.9069,1.7105,4.1406,1.8381,3.3501,7.6886,0.1817,3.628,0.5852,3.1657,5.7961,2.8073,3.2411,2.5979,3.8076,0.0042,2.9086,2.0368,0.8357,5.9849,2.0304,3.2212,5.9282,0.4573,6.4424,0.6792,5.1282,1.6995,0.5378,1.8732,2.6645,5.9757,1.519,3.2456,9.5769,0.9775,0.2604,1.9332,5.3177,3.3414,0.9022,1.799,4.391,4.3316,4.2251,5.6364,0.5593,2.121,0.6912,2.7689,1.0271,4.5304,5.9509,2.3945,0.7058,3.9555,0.0109,0.9036,1.1863,12.617,3.4593,3.0044,2.0048,1.989,0.7502,0.3382,7.7518,0.1435,0.2539,4.2645,4.2772,0.0067,0.8492,3.2601,3.0956,4.573,0.1135,1.2719,2.4026,0.026,7.2671,7.5575,8.1199,0.2529,4.4236,0.9198,0.7079,0.2178,3.1616,2.3925,3.5884,2.8033,2.4087,2.3027,0.4599,0.0135,0.3885,2.2038,2.3248,5.6424,1.6848,1.4482,2.6563,1.5782,0.0836,0.1892,2.5423,4.1735,0.0047,2.8336,0.739,2.9109,1.691,1.5877,1.6444,3.6472,0.2345,0.6303,0.54,13.2566,6.832,7.2894,1.5581,2.6975,0.7779,0.0068,2.8021,2.956,2.0278,4.9387,4.4392,2.3793,4.3034,1.4825,7.7549,7.2146,3.5359,4.5883,7.1239,2.9398,0.0986,2.1613,2.9795,15.6453,6.9406,5.3507,1.9853,0.0544,0.3753,1.3158,1.5731,9.0547,0.3302,5.2994,0.2387,0.0811,0.0156,0.4366,1.0587,2.8968,5.6596,6.9687,7.8178,7.677,2.2792,3.5846,1.8119,5.1142,1.3367,12.7734,7.9842,6.3837,5.9166,3.8443,7.1351,3.9667,3.101,7.5787,0.8949,2.3392,5.11,1.0094,4.6262,2.724,6.6733,3.503,1.1945,1.4508,3.393,1.319,5.8729,0.9842,2.3775,1.7522,1.2662,0.9299,0.0401,6.4871,0.003,2.6249,0.3125,2.881,2.1442,4.195,0.1697,1.9191,3.9616,6.1275,0.0016,6.4891,6.7097,6.7266,0.7767,3.6525,1.0961,4.1177,4.2618,0.3491,4.7895,5.6968,0.8417,1.9516,3.0209,2.4072,1.2692,3.6003,3.4603,4.8698,2.2595,2.7781,0.1809,0.0413,0.4838,0.2149,2.0214,0.0003,0.0014,0.1328,0.4741,4.1718,0.1031,5.1953,5.3198,5.2808,1.9007,3.4986,0.1087,0.0549,2.7086,8.1943,1.9505,4.9852,0.8437,6.5169,2.6243,6.1172,0.0633,5.7075,4.422,4.9162,2.2945,7.0991,1.7649,5.0334,5.484,0.0007,1.273,1.211,1.3191,0.3249,5.7445,2.7766,2.8336,2.8587,0.6722,3.2143,12.591,4.3179,5.5823,0.8678,4.4001,5.0786,5.5643,1.8444,2.0587,5.651,2.3925,2.1521,3.0498,4.8201,0.1422,1.1433,1.5192,4.6635,1.9336,1.7122,3.3116,1.268,2.2682,5.3573,0.0393,0.2155,1.9508,3.6087,5.7174,0.6166,0.4351,0.9857,2.3358,0.1091,0.8844,8.3199,0.1215,3.3898,1.0367,1.4522,4.6741,2.7359,4.2826,2.1632,5.4196,2.4642,1.577,6.4244,2.5602,3.9063,4.3433,5.7092,3.2585,0.9118,0.5773,1.3824,6.9751,0.0785,2.6021,4.9366,0.0607,5.1864,5.7399,3.3723,0.4212,2.4297,5.1129,0.1909,1.6722,7.1337,5.0851,0.1982,3.4671,0.0728,2.3633,0.1029,3.5646,3.6116,0.6204,9.7928,4.6673,5.9595,0.467,0.0052,5.5215,0.2172,0.0138,0.0008,3.4616,4.7118,1.0738,2.1256,3.918,2.3604,3.8557,0.0039,0.564,1.0726,0.8985,3.8603,3.0663,0.1963,6.93,5.6528,2.841,0.8316,3.7837,1.3188,1.2099,0.5468,0.3467,0.6197,4.7504,1.921,0.1773,5.3311,4.3227,4.3328,0.261,3.5258,0.9475,8.8905,2.6359,0.0658,0.0085,0.9207,0.0721,0.3863,1.2606,5.4609,0.8151,5.8703,8.2123,1.1699,4.0735,4.6411,5.2476,2.4548,1.7563,0.0152,0.1365,0.1594,2.2484,1.2922,0.0014,0.4376,4.2845,0.1229,1.0781,0.0009,0.3471,0.7506,2.53,5.4681,1.4486,2.5207,4.9759,2.5805,0.9343,1.4665,5.6938,2.4609,0.1711,1.3584,1.673,3.0045,3.5908,4.3512,4.6232,0.0153,7.283,8.7699,1.4675]}
{"prompt":"The American Civil Liberties Union on Friday launched the first legal challenge to President Donald Trump \u2019 s new restrictions on people entering the United States from eight countries . The civil rights group said","text":"The American Civil Liberties Union on Friday launched the first legal challenge to President Donald Trump \u2019 s new restrictions on people entering the United States from eight countries. The civil rights group said it would argue that Mr. Trump's travel policies violate a constitutional ban on government discrimination based on race, color, religion or sex. The order, issued earlier this month, temporarily banned entry of travelers from countries with high prevalence rate (over 30%) of two variants with a high potential to spread that have been identified in Brazil and South Africa.\nDr. Homi Patel, Director of the Center for the Study of the Developing World, talks about a book project which he will present Thursday, January 11 at 7:30 p.m. As a member of the Center's faculty, Patel will read excerpts from an ongoing book project about the history and social science of the nationwide famine in Bangladesh. Mr. Patel was recently a visiting professor at Pace University, where he also organized an event of its own about famines, both the recent one in Bangladesh and the one in the 1930s that resulted in the death of some 23 million people.\n\"It's an important issue because it involves a large number of people who have suffered so,\" said Patel. \"The book is designed to draw an international audience to this topic so they have the information they need to understand the famine and how Bangladesh as a whole has dealt with it.\"\nMr. Patel grew up in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and left to study at Stanford. He is known for his work in the field of politics and international relations, and the famine is a chapter in his research. \"It's very important for people to know that not only did the disaster occur, but people died,\" said Patel.\nAlthough people across the world are familiar with the famines of the past, they know little or nothing about those of the contemporary period. Mr. Patel believes that the social analysis of the famine will help clarify its causes. \"The most important event in recent history is the collapse of the Soviet Union, and it would be of no avail if people didn't understand what happened in the Soviet Union,\" he said. \"The Soviet Union collapsed because it wasn't able to control its own people as it tried to control the other countries.. This event is important because it represents the collapse of a country. And no matter what you think you're doing, a country can't keep its people together if there's anarchy in it.\"\nMr. Patel is not the only person who shares this view. Although most academics who study these events today tend to look from outside, people like Mr. Patel, who grew up there, can talk to them as equal participants.","token_len":544,"entropy":[6.8726,2.8918,0.0168,0.0015,4.3018,1.8132,4.4984,4.1456,1.6693,1.7504,0.1656,0.4425,2.6302,0.8781,0.0093,15.996,6.8017,7.7554,5.7183,6.7338,0.1252,5.6958,4.1498,0.0755,0.9021,0.0019,2.3637,4.927,2.2143,1.4362,2.1583,5.4104,1.011,0.5429,1.484,2.0027,2.0122,5.6523,0.6004,4.3901,0.3413,0.045,0.5024,1.6799,6.7152,1.3843,4.1079,2.9495,2.8195,0.4114,4.2842,3.7947,1.6123,0.0224,1.8829,0.7171,3.114,0.0255,0.1354,1.9335,3.5928,0.5495,2.4929,3.7068,2.151,2.1531,4.6463,0.1794,0.6222,0.1869,4.524,2.5912,1.3929,2.9521,3.7734,0.199,4.6675,1.635,3.7706,6.9125,9.8517,5.9595,6.0872,4.5176,2.7672,0.1468,9.0198,11.9761,7.8781,1.3699,1.4238,4.6474,2.448,3.6541,5.6882,5.2777,1.8528,1.6426,4.1369,11.2754,1.5176,4.0512,2.5248,0.9318,1.1128,19.6565,0.0975,11.8289,2.5474,6.1508,0.2076,4.81,0.0994,0.6351,2.2331,0.0775,4.0847,0.3036,0.0087,4.3489,7.5854,0.2045,0.0296,0.8847,10.9745,1.096,4.03,7.2823,6.7234,4.7249,3.7879,3.7471,3.0637,5.621,2.2311,4.1912,3.1542,1.9496,4.8234,1.2975,0.5907,0.7868,0.0011,0.0006,0.172,9.6469,2.4972,3.6805,0.0075,0.3994,4.1732,2.9699,4.8643,0.5667,5.2113,1.557,6.6843,4.1253,0.2721,3.6329,5.0056,2.2888,1.7493,3.3972,1.1232,3.4651,1.7643,5.2163,4.8706,0.1278,1.7861,12.5801,8.2127,2.1572,4.8151,0.8948,5.203,0.0005,1.5635,3.2828,3.4348,3.505,2.1503,1.5285,0.5326,7.6116,0.0531,1.8947,1.0004,0.1204,4.386,7.2783,2.7661,2.0439,4.9657,5.8031,1.7293,3.2621,6.5545,0.0117,2.902,6.9079,4.1982,5.6683,3.5832,0.4882,2.162,0.104,0.5357,2.459,0.5427,2.3749,8.7062,0.0795,3.0064,3.909,0.0678,0.8759,2.2758,0.057,5.1698,6.227,2.2113,0.2886,0.3995,1.1832,1.9275,2.8536,0.8618,3.1385,1.6995,2.9519,2.3653,1.2378,4.8895,2.3405,4.2831,1.4727,0.0066,0.9146,1.7498,1.6278,3.5291,4.7386,9.3573,1.0996,3.1841,0.9189,0.3654,2.4546,4.0189,1.7473,5.0106,0.1471,4.8232,5.844,3.4337,0.4319,1.8424,3.1499,2.7232,4.5139,3.062,3.5021,1.4782,3.5003,0.8856,0.047,0.3356,2.2464,1.3763,6.0659,1.6042,1.9687,7.2624,7.8257,0.2196,1.1116,2.0132,5.255,0.0223,0.378,0.6978,0.5633,2.2852,0.0004,0.903,8.1781,0.0033,0.1545,5.8546,0.0007,0.695,1.4291,0.4133,1.309,5.7147,3.2522,1.4224,1.7532,3.7028,2.1528,0.7719,2.5802,6.1602,0.389,0.3587,1.685,1.6458,1.4772,1.3447,0.0519,6.5032,0.8432,2.8493,0.6623,1.22,0.9158,3.8726,10.4226,3.6017,1.7068,6.8904,0.1866,0.4188,3.7137,1.18,2.5852,2.003,0.7261,3.3715,1.0744,1.549,2.7115,0.4654,1.3981,1.2439,5.3192,0.8618,2.5112,0.9808,6.9911,2.178,1.3094,0.3894,4.0601,4.514,1.869,0.9107,0.8717,0.149,1.1032,5.5785,5.6056,5.0676,0.2625,0.4688,1.4629,4.7366,0.0315,0.3527,5.9397,0.0078,2.2793,0.6791,2.1765,0.5556,2.2012,4.5615,1.2183,4.3714,0.1762,0.1144,4.5709,3.7153,0.5418,5.239,3.1005,0.5213,4.242,0.0003,0.1986,3.1105,0.4739,1.5015,5.9744,7.1566,0.6902,0.5772,1.0808,3.445,2.0227,6.2905,3.9825,1.617,1.373,0.9354,1.9396,4.7266,0.5296,6.0923,1.4358,4.9721,0.4763,1.6969,0.7785,4.039,0.0684,0.6978,2.3423,0.0561,1.6389,1.3665,2.3137,4.9984,0.5508,5.6448,3.6284,4.46,0.6846,2.8549,2.2751,0.0025,1.8737,1.9512,1.5193,1.6491,1.0563,1.7306,0.0247,0.7666,0.863,0.0729,0.0277,1.2237,2.0697,5.5723,0.217,1.4333,1.2119,2.213,3.5207,0.0045,1.6493,0.0037,3.1125,0.9807,1.9895,1.9196,4.601,2.0603,4.7284,0.0745,2.1491,1.1834,3.7843,1.6305,9.5823,3.2903,5.3479,1.4517,3.8203,0.6575,0.3334,4.4144,0.9507,2.6597,0.0502,2.2454,4.4126,3.2907,3.5406,6.7098,2.0212,0.911,2.9996,1.1663,5.8149,2.6969,1.5619,0.4131,5.142,1.5165,2.3327,1.819,4.6532,1.0531,0.7129,3.4015,3.2586,3.6823,0.8756,7.1682,2.1118,1.7458,0.5738,0.331,2.0377,0.0003,0.0799,2.2234,3.4912,0.97,0.6744,2.9767,1.2891,6.1387,1.6048,0.4291,0.185,6.7636,4.2697,5.5005,3.6455,1.7904,5.0835,2.8322,7.0333,5.0932,0.0561,4.2149,6.6411,4.7216,2.2648,5.4261,2.8595,2.4793,0.0003,0.3797,2.8119,1.0216,4.1953,0.0007,5.1916,0.4493,3.5189,6.1734,0.9991,2.1929,3.9428,10.3762,4.2546,1.0103]}

ICRC chief Peter Maurer said that there are now more than 20 civil wars raging across more. ICRC reported the highest number of civilians killed inside civilian targets ever recorded from a foreign campaign, with 400 civilians killed by raids in September and over 500 in the three weeks following. The attacks, by NATO coalition forces, have claimed over 1,000 lives since a deadly raid on Gaddafi s government palace on 21 Oct.\nThe ICRC report said there are more than 20 civil wars raging across the world today, compared with one in 1999. It said the number of civilians killed in September by coalition military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya was more than the total killed in conflicts on three continents during 1998. The ICRC said an average of two civilians are killed each day by coalition forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. In Somalia, the number of civilians killed in September 2011 is the highest ever recorded, surpassing the worst year of civil war in 1992.\nA US spy ship has docked in the Gulf with dozens of fighter jets to patrol with allies, a sign of growing anxiety over the prospect of Iran becoming a nuclear power. While the US Navy has routinely used the region as an \" Atlantic Command Command Zone\" to conduct a wide array of operations, it is the first time US warships have berthed in the Gulf in the last decade. The USS Princeton, with 57 personnel, is arriving for patrols in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, the US Navy said in a statement. A US nuclear-tipped bomber from the USS Hornet is due to fly over Iran, a move that may trigger a snap back by the country s leaders on the issue of Iran s nuclear program. The US and the United Kingdom said they were training Iran to launch missiles in the event of a strike. Meanwhile Tehran said the UK should not use the situation to launch an attack, following claims that Britain was taking over the region from the US.","token_len":544,"entropy":[8.1861,4.6757,6.9919,0.4837,1.1122,1.8074,4.5629,7.9925,1.4824,9.3287,11.2864,10.3726,3.0223,4.0405,0.2753,2.6184,5.7671,2.7777,5.851,2.749,1.5112,1.3732,1.8646,3.4093,0.0104,1.8085,3.0608,4.6036,1.0051,0.1311,0.8864,0.0315,4.8951,6.3451,0.6986,4.6336,4.3734,3.6803,0.9901,4.1649,0.3274,0.0769,1.0858,4.1566,5.1813,3.819,4.0422,3.7744,3.312,1.7806,0.0009,8.9057,2.9826,2.7262,0.0008,3.1504,2.3005,0.0121,8.6668,7.1833,3.5791,8.6796,8.7424,1.7193,0.4272,4.6088,9.9332,3.9921,2.5271,2.3073,2.7881,6.1638,0.4129,1.2202,4.5187,1.5679,3.8862,1.0358,7.8815,0.0304,3.9627,0.3641,0.77,3.9126,6.9675,0.1032,1.7868,1.2605,0.1416,0.4678,2.8237,4.7631,5.6489,2.3921,0.2394,0.3428,2.1152,4.6171,3.3304,0.8811,5.6721,0.2492,7.5439,1.5298,6.4312,2.7982,4.4512,0.9855,3.0544,0.9536,2.2977,1.5342,14.6702,2.5728,1.3811,5.759,1.7594,3.7575,2.5162,1.454,2.0413,0.0276,3.8018,0.8114,1.4608,2.5744,1.983,7.0793,3.1153,3.6872,3.0481,0.0225,2.2184,4.0043,3.955,0.9677,0.0159,0.0004,0.0,0.0002,3.0329,4.0552,2.7052,4.4286,2.0794,4.8026,2.6679,0.6743,10.3216,0.0019,3.2354,4.7763,5.8837,1.1969,0.8596,2.3854,4.2947,3.4325,3.3947,2.418,0.0492,3.6376,7.8833,2.1567,1.8328,1.7566,5.9068,13.2449,7.2435,0.0009,4.6914,3.8773,4.7654,0.6052,0.2133,3.0344,0.3924,7.377,7.8868,6.5131,5.6338,0.9709,5.8042,2.9828,6.2448,5.1631,1.9648,1.687,6.1662,2.1679,0.3383,3.2286,7.4489,1.3327,5.0439,1.674,5.0741,2.964,3.2865,2.4571,4.9461,3.6616,3.4628,1.529,2.0162,4.5018,2.9682,5.3578,5.965,6.3047,1.8614,0.912,1.3504,4.1699,3.4473,2.3886,0.1705,1.3292,0.0629,2.2439,4.6688,6.3918,4.7217,1.1562,6.0244,6.5813,4.0232,4.942,2.4859,4.8159,6.3669,0.7967,1.6792,2.7783,4.9913,0.0006,1.9127,2.0441,3.4806,1.5711,3.2899,0.0265,0.3162,0.0784,0.0118,0.0093,0.0216,7.0996,1.5057,3.9767,1.0643,6.4812,0.5251,4.6189,0.9633,4.5581,1.3142,2.3321,0.8808,1.6968,2.6371,0.2299,1.4181,0.2504,1.3052,6.2162,3.9887,2.5656,3.5666,1.2921,1.515,1.4819,1.7478,0.6988,0.5926,0.8338,1.7763,2.6196,0.0353,4.5748,2.563,2.0418,0.8375,6.7545,4.8576,5.0467,0.0915,3.6875,5.3006,2.1938,1.7252,1.8895,0.0003,1.0776,5.3295,3.0716,0.1111,4.3388,2.0879,2.4201,0.1182,1.7687,0.4991,1.4971,1.438,1.9207,0.9793,1.3547,0.971,0.8698,0.3715,0.0989,0.802,3.2321,4.1251,0.251,1.6391,2.0184,0.2946,0.5131,0.09,1.8219,4.2184,6.1207,2.5586,1.9187,0.2123,2.2436,0.2955,1.6577,4.2897,0.0003,0.9898,6.0966,3.0452,1.8488,3.819,0.3711,0.5882,5.2641,0.6178,1.5289,3.504,3.225,7.494,4.4183,3.6179,5.3493,0.0129,0.5174,1.6262,3.1595,4.2226,5.4464,0.0472,6.8053,0.2792,2.6504,4.3593,6.3366,5.1312,2.1179,3.5617,4.2651,0.8113,2.6619,5.9185,1.1447,0.8019,5.1183,0.0524,6.3254,3.892,0.8156,2.1072,0.8296,0.57,6.1809,1.3304,1.1766,3.7663,1.2093,6.7092,3.7048,2.586,4.7686,0.9146,2.1527,2.9988,13.7926,6.1197,7.6933,6.846,2.9183,1.1705,2.6137,4.2298,3.1094,1.8311,0.001,2.1989,0.7082,2.2288,1.8506,3.1784,3.6689,0.5509,3.4688,2.0954,0.2618,8.4009,0.3352,0.0005,0.6834,0.5922,0.6254,3.0144,2.0546,2.3921,1.8089,0.3846,1.7688,3.3598,8.2383,1.2859,4.8116,6.7523,2.9612,0.8621,1.4865,9.2301,3.0576,7.7384,0.8391,0.3293,2.4252,0.002,2.341,1.8688,3.5688,0.0034,0.0378,0.0001,0.0,1.4192,1.9245,2.8597,1.5495,0.4944,1.4719,0.1961,0.1497,0.4284,3.6721,1.026,6.142,2.2661,3.0181,0.0464,3.452,3.8749,0.5982,1.9745,3.4751,0.0018,1.7029,3.1829,0.1533,2.4831,1.6851,4.5826,2.9145,3.0179,3.6706,0.7024,3.9838,4.2906,1.1657,8.5918,3.6822,6.5858,0.9343,4.2783,7.4225,4.385,3.6586,1.1763,2.0295,1.1843,2.6755,3.109,0.2495,0.6903,0.27,1.8063,1.3239,3.8023,2.5264,4.0397,1.5079,5.0037,1.2288,1.931,7.8464,4.2614,1.9119,5.0509,3.485,3.0144,1.2146,3.746,0.2482,0.6101,4.0821,1.3171,5.9489,8.2937,3.8404,2.3817,3.5467,4.604,2.1454,3.7222,1.1213,5.9631,1.2653,3.9698,2.9453,0.7107,2.7415,4.7442,5.2695,1.7735,2.8874,1.6551,5.4277,4.3606,1.4503,4.2423,1.7236,1.6786,0.6727,0.4468]}

She is a graduate of Beijing's China Human Rights Law and Practice Research Institute and has played an influential role in a spate of legal cases against the Chinese government.\nIn a separate case on Tuesday, China added eight to Luo Hongbin's seven-year- sentence, who was convicted in 2016 for inciting riot with an uplifting speech that called for China to improve the treatment of foreigners in the country.\nHua Chunying, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, said on Monday:'It has never been the case that the government wants to shut up people speaking truth to power. '\nChina is trying to shore up its reputation for human rights following a sharp decline in the number of major rights campaigns and human rights activists.\nBut it has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years for alleged human rights violations in the mostly rural and impoverished western regions, where people hold political views other than the regime's orthodox line.\nLast week, China sentenced four people to death for crimes related to the 1989 student uprising in Beijing, which it says was the spark for the global Tiananmen Square protests against the brutal rule of the Communist Party.\nThe four, all men, were convicted of inciting unrest on the anniversary of the events, which ended with the killing of hundreds of demonstrators.\nChina has been accused of human rights abuses in prisons, in particular during religious campaigns.","token_len":545,"entropy":[11.6994,2.6822,5.4199,8.1496,0.3778,0.5163,3.5549,0.2032,0.2455,1.7367,1.0528,8.4112,0.6938,4.4781,2.9193,1.1641,5.2603,1.5462,0.2753,2.1777,4.1631,5.9555,0.0003,1.6688,9.0742,1.4162,1.1973,5.8437,0.7701,0.3177,6.3678,3.368,2.0163,3.925,0.0006,1.6772,2.2591,0.0161,0.143,0.1753,16.0725,5.4172,0.2062,0.953,3.7964,3.0555,4.7084,1.2414,5.2779,0.4104,0.7214,0.3555,0.6074,9.7613,5.9434,4.6782,7.5841,6.9403,11.4824,8.3454,7.2977,1.4471,5.994,5.5182,3.3534,4.0037,5.3371,0.0358,1.2447,1.9919,0.3406,4.354,2.8618,4.8202,5.6415,0.7148,4.4083,4.1197,0.2689,5.0985,2.9213,2.2298,4.4134,9.7267,14.3979,6.4477,1.1482,0.3687,1.1115,2.5195,0.6355,1.4496,9.9647,5.9289,2.9757,1.9423,1.7371,5.9088,0.2324,13.4039,13.0981,8.4185,1.8904,3.475,4.4116,7.9619,10.4272,7.88,0.3136,5.8936,2.25,3.1793,3.1806,0.1118,4.4033,0.3346,3.05,0.9492,4.8241,0.1419,1.5123,3.9151,3.1731,2.4789,0.918,1.7923,4.9117,1.8985,5.3253,4.6571,4.4073,1.6498,0.0566,4.3835,1.4299,2.855,1.4839,4.4051,0.014,0.0732,2.1333,4.3302,0.5256,4.0035,0.1152,0.4408,1.1576,3.5272,0.5734,0.164,7.2848,0.3708,3.397,2.8821,0.8331,1.2904,5.3075,0.8329,1.1695,5.9917,1.695,5.7604,0.2896,0.338,4.0743,2.0293,3.0927,2.5338,5.889,4.3633,0.8122,2.3534,3.2275,0.0723,2.1123,3.3289,0.0033,4.209,4.2905,1.6064,5.5518,2.1231,3.7818,6.4994,0.4233,0.9277,7.105,6.1886,2.6313,3.1975,1.8577,0.0381,4.8268,4.3423,8.9791,0.2227,0.1434,4.991,1.2069,1.7735,1.2814,0.0178,0.0895,1.5469,5.9367,1.4782,1.6807,0.4196,4.7895,1.891,1.4699,2.2696,2.0237,0.2975,8.5088,0.9257,4.4361,3.4194,0.3941,0.4877,3.5018,2.614,0.2033,3.6257,10.5512,8.7411,1.273,4.6832,0.146,5.4671,3.9409,3.3551,0.5417,1.6246,2.1975,1.4012,0.3932,1.6639,0.3003,4.5476,0.2609,1.2315,0.4216,3.5655,12.2539,0.3603,0.0002,8.6175,2.6971,6.6899,2.0308,0.3403,0.6978,1.5429,1.756,1.9855,4.4188,5.4707,3.2799,0.0167,2.7534,3.1031,6.3192,3.6567,0.2455,3.1506,1.4415,3.4886,4.4474,6.6094,3.0857,2.0606,1.9176,2.92,3.2816,6.0073,0.4324,3.318,0.953,5.559,5.6368,0.1841,3.646,3.4462,7.2207,5.0086,0.5386,1.6419,1.9756,7.2334,1.8796,2.7413,0.0499,0.1289,4.2992,5.468,0.0005,2.5343,1.6688,1.3282,2.4431,3.3817,0.5778,0.8819,0.2493,2.8595,2.5144,3.0053,0.5988,2.9128,1.8332,0.1026,4.7162,7.0186,5.4511,3.5103,15.0579,6.9736,4.8812,1.5595,3.626,0.51,0.1259,3.5718,9.6812,1.8208,6.6832,1.0168,2.3944,1.3132,5.4207,1.9947,3.9972,5.4773,4.6015,2.7491,12.6875,0.5135,1.4053,3.4984,4.8712,0.2441,3.8316,0.2465,6.0285,2.2882,2.919,0.0367,5.7499,1.9491,1.456,0.6164,0.31,0.3374,7.0116,3.7315,3.8908,1.7867,0.3916,1.9692,5.8597,1.108,1.3455,0.2701,0.4328,1.9095,1.8646,11.6347,4.5727,3.2436,5.7211,0.192,2.5795,2.0621,0.2565,1.9323,2.3478,5.1569,0.3882,6.1494,2.9558,3.0718,6.8359,5.5976,1.7157,0.0529,1.331,5.0161,2.4974,3.7059,2.8636,3.6924,0.0785,7.7588,0.0182,0.6393,3.1192,2.2203,2.028,0.0026,5.4144,1.6512,5.9329,3.8532,0.1577,1.9297,0.5866,0.0268,7.6514,3.429,5.8392,3.2506,2.6374,0.0076,3.5441,2.077,0.5748,4.4133,2.7917,0.8409,3.5846,3.8597,3.015,2.2898,0.1421,0.7004,1.2534,5.8077,1.2902,0.0052,1.0379,2.1706,1.8523,7.4175,1.6081,2.3248,3.6354,4.0016,4.3633,2.8072,1.4167,4.5343,4.9486,2.4406,3.7638,5.2942,0.0246,2.7238,6.7417,1.3732,9.1876,3.5476,0.5248,0.3391,4.2197,1.957,0.3336,2.7608,4.3919,3.8976,2.4572,0.8619,4.3514,0.6241,5.7475,3.1436,0.0041,1.8116,4.4775,6.996,1.1634,1.2665,3.5331,1.3356,2.2668,6.0869,2.5371,1.0128,3.3185,5.0958,0.7842,1.19,4.5168,5.2167,0.0005,0.001,0.3168,1.0759,3.8437,0.7721,6.4265,2.9853,0.1696,1.4527,1.8281,0.2214,0.494,0.4221,2.2337,4.507,3.6116,1.9929,4.1643,0.4456,0.6323,2.1893,0.9662,2.3091,4.641,3.7334,2.2961,4.2845,0.0641,0.3227,5.5713,1.5146,1.55,3.5846,1.0211,0.8773,3.2115,0.057,2.1517,0.1454,3.1234,1.1321,0.4325,3.8304,1.3197,2.542,2.3435,0.1862,2.6182,0.0056,0.573,1.3472,8.0703,1.8755,3.8548,5.3725,4.0279,9.4339,6.1701,3.2367]}

Commission has announced that it will begin laying off staff and closing facilities because the agency\u2019s budget has been reduced by about $ 2.2 billion. The move comes as the Trump administration faces another deficit and as the F.D.C. is now facing a lack of funds to operate.\nThe F.D.C. Commission has already laid off 2,500 positions, closed more than 20 offices and announced that 1,000 employees would no longer be required to work on the day-to-day administration of the agency.\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, this is part of a larger effort to slash 1,800 agency employees, and President Trump himself had promised to eliminate thousands of positions.

The country","text":"Largely unperturbed by Angela Merkel s failure to form a government after a September election, many Germans are taking the prospect of several more months of coalition talks in their stride. The country s economy is stable, with the Federal Reserve promising to sustain rates at low levels for the foreseeable future. Unemployment s at a 30 year low and inflation below the Feds 2 per cent target. But with the polls still indicating a clear majority against joining the euro zone s monetary union, many Germans appear to be unwilling to surrender the nation s status as the last outpost of the traditional industrial economy. A lack of progress on Germany s political future and a continuing wave of anti-euro sentiment could also give new political life to a once-vigorous opposition party whose core is now the party of economic nationalism. In his new book, The New National Politics in Germany, the political scientist Markus Wolf argues that the SPD has lost its way, losing sight of the kind of economic development and social cohesion that made Germany a model for the world s democracies. Wolf suggests that many voters have drifted away from the SPD to other parties, most notably the far right Alternative for Germany ( AfD ). The party, which s been banned from most television debates, enjoys broad support among young voters and many young voters in the former SPD-led coalition. These voters sided with the SPD almost throughout the past century, for example voting for its left-wing coalition on the war memorial at the Brandenburg Gate in 1945. But Wolf argues that this vote is now shifting to the far right. The SPD s economic policy at the start of the 1990s was a mix of the left and the right, with many of its hard-left policies aimed at the country s biggest companies. This left the country s biggest business owners, led by billionaire Horst Seehofer, free to support the SPD. Meanwhile, the country s centre-right ( CDU-CSU ) suffered badly from the fall of the Berlin wall and its subsequent loss of power. But Wolf contends that since Germany s economy has grown in tandem with the rise of the euro zone, both left and right parties have become beholden to this economic system, with the two major German coalitions agreeing to cut labour costs and taxes to attract investors. This is why the SPD s loss of power is not being seen as a blow to the country. Instead, it is seen by many as a positive event for democracy. It s now up to the right to come up with a better vision of Germany s future, said Wolf, warning that a continuation of the current policies could send voters to the AfD, which has already won more than 100,000 votes in the last parliament. \/SERVICE","token_len":547,"entropy":[7.0954,5.0136,7.1156,0.015,0.9899,11.7586,1.7979,10.0125,5.1285,0.2689,6.2371,0.3689,1.6891,3.8827,2.9133,8.0789,1.4157,0.5079,4.3992,2.4357,1.5667,4.7014,2.7743,5.9036,0.0698,8.7004,2.0387,2.8274,0.5365,6.865,1.4509,3.1812,2.9215,2.3175,0.3014,3.0851,3.7403,9.0289,6.0875,1.0034,6.9293,0.9464,2.5144,2.1453,6.4353,6.5655,6.8018,0.978,7.5434,4.5936,2.9897,4.9573,0.337,1.1791,1.3539,1.7762,0.0084,0.5353,4.2488,8.6689,3.3096,2.284,5.335,3.4275,0.6708,3.5463,3.6722,4.7092,1.8119,7.9621,10.0177,4.9926,4.263,0.0055,3.4047,4.3413,3.7555,3.8641,1.6764,7.4268,3.1023,8.3183,1.4213,5.8213,0.7276,4.8909,4.8753,0.3684,1.1855,2.4387,8.935,5.328,0.0808,0.3018,2.3766,0.8484,5.7471,0.7825,0.3636,5.6894,0.0705,6.4276,3.0924,4.9927,1.4531,4.6959,0.76,1.39,5.0057,5.4966,0.1744,1.13,7.7595,6.2566,2.6521,0.5276,3.8187,5.2471,0.0175,4.4622,1.3998,3.8386,1.9319,4.0001,3.0776,3.5548,1.9311,5.2803,5.7774,0.0009,3.1643,0.0277,3.3097,0.7133,3.6327,3.8388,4.8471,4.9174,4.8479,5.6708,0.0143,2.0321,4.5678,0.7793,3.6402,4.4606,0.1306,6.6448,2.5205,4.256,4.6274,2.3565,4.6679,3.9168,3.5679,0.6091,5.7538,2.059,0.4529,3.5675,4.4294,3.6458,0.3776,1.0044,2.6221,3.9454,4.8776,6.2525,3.475,1.3607,0.6826,3.6645,4.14,1.1211,4.8205,6.157,3.7659,0.118,1.2416,5.6459,2.6032,2.9896,1.0561,3.5361,1.8194,4.6606,3.3701,0.0145,0.8511,6.4852,0.0023,3.6052,3.7539,2.9284,1.7002,1.9569,0.4422,3.396,1.9494,1.8688,4.9793,1.3089,1.7121,2.7113,2.579,6.449,0.7236,2.209,5.0169,0.2545,4.4841,3.43,2.5876,5.1152,0.8037,0.0449,0.6411,0.8278,3.3532,4.9512,0.8133,1.2541,5.3797,0.3098,0.6465,3.2353,1.0621,2.0578,0.2308,0.002,0.8711,10.4691,0.0002,1.7111,2.2103,2.7725,2.5754,1.1,9.7646,2.8273,7.4038,0.6079,6.0051,8.4509,4.1986,1.3432,6.7132,4.0087,0.1459,0.7901,3.1378,0.789,1.5611,3.414,2.9096,1.7132,3.1892,1.5594,5.466,4.7249,2.7591,1.6142,1.8774,1.797,5.8475,1.0674,10.4564,0.0702,0.6777,2.2403,7.3655,7.1078,0.381,5.3528,6.7523,0.9044,5.4997,1.2367,5.3006,0.6073,3.7766,5.2576,0.5886,0.2284,4.3519,5.3843,1.2284,7.2224,5.2948,3.8119,1.0203,5.4999,0.0012,0.0057,0.8453,4.1399,1.0481,2.1108,3.1854,1.5942,0.0795,2.9729,3.6959,2.6074,2.445,4.6814,1.1908,0.3896,1.1357,0.1502,1.4295,2.3033,2.6824,5.0962,4.8261,2.7398,5.8061,0.4993,4.1956,0.0553,0.5188,3.6612,0.0208,0.9945,3.0313,4.4812,0.0153,3.6665,3.6548,1.4442,1.4804,0.2718,1.318,1.9506,3.2484,1.784,1.6313,5.9624,1.5586,2.3412,2.6703,4.4019,0.0998,3.0156,5.5841,0.5057,5.6195,5.3324,0.8537,3.2756,3.5839,1.3593,1.2901,0.8266,2.9822,2.7076,4.8562,1.6443,4.5138,0.0713,5.3833,7.6017,0.0197,0.0669,0.5435,0.001,0.9346,7.0219,1.4037,5.9446,1.1773,1.6894,2.3729,6.3797,0.1527,1.1567,3.3925,0.7004,6.7705,0.0896,0.6543,5.7379,6.5128,0.0053,2.3166,1.6959,0.9543,0.2771,6.6315,5.1123,0.8399,1.3045,4.5744,1.2772,0.6287,1.0558,5.018,1.5283,2.9135,3.0421,4.6254,0.0471,2.7768,1.1944,3.6515,3.4699,3.96,0.0627,6.2336,5.5941,0.5773,3.1842,1.0785,3.0295,3.2507,2.525,0.1045,0.8857,3.3802,0.1038,0.7895,3.2784,0.9807,1.2271,5.1138,4.2878,0.1974,0.0301,2.1025,0.8459,3.2493,9.6099,0.0015,0.0386,4.7072,3.2033,4.5653,2.4884,2.8939,1.021,4.6068,4.0179,5.6901,6.4402,0.1251,5.914,0.5514,4.0385,6.4851,0.448,1.2449,5.9397,2.6605,4.9203,4.6154,0.6424,2.6879,2.4346,3.8233,1.6674,1.2799,2.5817,8.4648,0.1586,0.5442,2.0475,3.5329,4.6724,2.6609,0.215,0.5784,4.5989,0.1916,0.6023,3.2316,3.8656,2.7677,0.1532,1.3965,0.6192,1.2435,3.8007,0.6554,0.6463,0.4988,4.379,5.8723,1.924,6.1611,1.1915,3.2837,2.2536,4.7422,5.1348,0.1509,1.0822,5.7576,0.4778,5.7256,1.4191,0.0109,1.1939,3.9072,3.7627,0.9639,2.3327,0.4088,0.1391,1.4833,5.7142,0.6045,1.1975,6.6815,0.4512,2.7168,7.1597,0.0215,0.648,2.3488,4.5487,1.252,5.8768,4.4068,1.1811,0.4426,8.0393,0.0024,3.2557,1.2673,1.6967,3.4459,2.8733,3.0651,0.6875,3.3315,3.2286,0.0052,0.6144,1.0704,0.6319,2.4936,3.6379,0.7704,10.6202,10.6715,3.1482]}

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday nominated Carnegie Mellon University Professor Marvin Goodfriend to become a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , adding a well-known monetary economist to a central bank losing","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday nominated Carnegie Mellon University Professor Marvin Goodfriend to become a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, adding a well-known monetary economist to a central bank losing faith in its own members.\nTrump named Goodfriend for the post, which will become vacant with the departure of Fed chair Janet Yellen and vice chair Brian Brooks on Jan. 31. Goodfriend was one of Yellen's top picks for the Fed's board.\nGoodfriend, 70, is an economist and business executive and is best known for creating the Goodfriend model for risk-based capital standards, which are used by financial institutions around the world, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of England. Goodfriend co-chaired the Federal Reserve Financial Stability Forum, which helped produce recommendations on preventing excessive risk taking by banks.\nHe also served on the boards of directors of Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase & Co., and is a prominent backer of the American tax reform proposal on the congressional agenda, according to a statement from Carnegie Mellon University.\nGoodfriend currently serves on the boards of directors of CMU, the Washington-based National Center for Policy Research and the National Commission on Banking Supervision.\nHe helped launch the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Advanced Study of Finance in 2011. He joined CMU as a professor in 2004.\nGoodfriend said \"great confidence is placed in me for my future role as a member of the FOMC,\" according to the statement from Carnegie Mellon University.\nGoodfriend described himself as a \"constitutionalist\" investor, but he also said earlier this year on CNBC : \"I don't know. We are talking about the central bankers and their role in the economy. We just don't have a very good understanding about their role.\nHe added that financial market deregulation since the recession has opened the door for a potentially disruptive influx of new risks to the global financial system. We need strong central banks that have the capacity to keep things under control, he said.\nThe Fed has been under increasing political pressure following the election of President Donald Trump to raise interest rates that the central bank has kept near historic lows for four years. Yellen has said the Fed, which she chairs, should be prepared for inflation as the economy matures.\nGoodfriend also testified during the first full day of hearings by former Fed vice chair Yellen to examine her ability to understand economics, political science and international affairs.\nYellen, who said she never consulted Goodfriend when she was vice chair of the Fed, also told lawmakers today that a number of her Fed colleagues thought the Fed should not raise interest rates at the end of her term.","token_len":547,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.5734,2.2629,7.1702,11.7136,0.4782,0.2771,2.413,7.7443,6.8391,5.0557,0.8149,3.363,2.3193,3.4589,0.0253,0.3615,4.1843,0.6361,0.5746,2.7899,0.0287,1.9883,6.0132,2.2392,8.2152,0.0361,0.7077,6.3853,2.6048,0.4331,2.9009,5.4151,0.5644,10.5939,5.4952,0.18,1.4811,3.3951,7.2167,0.3104,0.178,21.2104,4.0653,0.8826,0.0008,4.2697,1.7765,1.8858,1.419,0.9585,1.7502,3.0488,7.1858,5.5211,1.1619,4.1339,0.0187,2.3908,2.5416,0.4244,0.0059,0.0,2.9855,5.0814,0.324,6.7453,8.2867,3.3281,2.8492,0.0019,3.1041,0.3088,2.2508,0.001,2.2799,3.4032,0.0105,6.3147,0.0,0.1261,2.4624,5.1476,2.3436,0.65,2.3977,1.9625,1.8325,2.5953,0.3143,18.827,0.0008,1.5266,5.757,0.0104,2.0767,2.3602,1.4835,1.8524,5.9151,4.2283,2.9222,2.9056,3.6533,0.0197,0.2283,5.8776,0.5386,9.4095,2.3816,3.8231,1.4275,6.233,1.0012,1.6083,4.6174,8.4018,1.7368,1.0198,3.1091,1.8323,1.5565,2.7675,0.6555,4.2251,0.0008,0.0719,3.3264,0.9339,1.4182,3.0293,0.0472,2.23,0.0253,0.6859,0.0026,1.5576,0.6586,3.1676,0.062,1.1811,0.2195,3.9764,0.0007,4.1851,0.1858,5.205,0.0005,0.3181,2.6887,0.3691,7.0298,2.1545,4.237,1.5192,1.0427,3.3162,5.2081,5.6376,1.6037,7.8346,3.8485,1.921,2.1717,2.0096,2.2817,0.9693,0.2357,9.7551,2.4209,1.5488,2.0939,0.2507,3.9192,0.0412,6.9482,0.2852,3.0051,0.0053,0.6824,3.9127,0.0058,0.0,1.5226,3.4977,0.0202,2.6103,0.0023,1.2189,1.9886,2.9937,1.2058,5.2799,4.9959,0.0605,0.9073,3.7303,9.4757,2.1689,4.0959,5.254,1.2974,8.5501,2.3454,2.6191,2.8335,0.0006,1.9348,2.872,0.7731,7.5564,0.0812,1.9907,0.7002,0.2051,1.8974,0.0009,6.6565,0.7139,1.6553,0.1593,3.3911,0.0338,3.0193,0.1568,9.1064,0.4907,1.1265,2.0672,5.7391,1.3788,0.0077,3.499,1.7634,0.0692,1.6886,2.2804,1.2941,0.6923,2.5907,5.8621,0.077,2.9742,4.2821,0.0683,0.3992,0.7018,3.7843,5.5136,3.9905,0.4412,5.2873,0.0301,2.6679,0.7395,3.1472,0.4949,5.862,3.1715,1.7218,3.007,1.4091,1.9321,4.2233,3.4383,0.0009,2.2612,0.7087,2.0434,0.8573,4.0469,1.236,0.7119,1.615,0.0017,4.5263,5.5584,7.0349,5.4634,3.4801,6.358,0.247,6.3167,5.2536,1.998,4.1441,2.3051,0.785,1.1643,1.9877,0.0345,0.126,4.3228,0.8084,0.0004,2.7722,1.9579,0.0008,1.0678,1.3328,2.7408,1.9403,0.0083,1.038,0.1938,0.5301,1.8073,0.0011,6.9067,0.8645,0.1979,0.598,0.7842,8.1926,2.3657,1.1393,8.708,1.93,2.6904,1.7545,1.943,1.2849,7.8074,0.1735,0.3236,3.1694,1.0369,8.1123,0.1177,0.9168,2.658,0.0007,3.6875,5.0058,4.4675,3.2495,3.6252,0.3722,2.6912,5.1422,2.7377,2.4579,2.7625,4.42,0.6056,1.3617,2.163,1.0501,2.6636,4.7197,0.7964,0.0011,2.3356,1.4146,4.1529,0.8837,1.5813,3.6911,3.511,0.904,1.7156,2.5939,5.2245,2.1908,0.8579,6.8336,4.748,5.9127,6.3907,0.9993,4.998,0.9814,6.0255,1.3576,0.4342,0.7026,2.7457,6.4385,3.6443,7.5,0.0093,1.64,7.1301,2.3587,0.7111,3.7475,0.8046,0.093,0.4412,6.9338,1.6274,5.6233,3.1609,0.7306,1.8944,3.1156,1.5141,2.2883,0.2063,4.5182,4.6972,3.1885,0.0143,1.723,6.8257,0.1503,0.2063,0.3309,2.5513,2.4537,1.8623,1.6719,2.287,3.0709,4.5392,0.2825,5.4869,0.7741,3.1141,0.0519,2.2059,0.452,0.0187,2.274,5.3563,0.3792,0.0103,5.5839,4.6553,2.0012,0.1314,1.6369,5.348,4.09,4.366,0.0742,3.2387,4.4764,0.1514,0.3808,4.0014,0.0008,1.5593,1.8194,1.49,0.7439,5.4833,1.1733,4.4784,3.718,0.1598,1.4897,2.4538,5.1718,2.5009,5.8393,4.6266,2.6881,1.5731,4.6702,0.0024,0.6011,0.6667,2.4867,0.0029,2.9454,6.0989,4.0282,0.6235,5.0329,4.0707,1.0038,0.0519,2.3281,4.6595,4.2754,1.3832,4.5027,0.1836,5.6758,0.0005,3.8359,6.3429,3.207,5.4504,0.0219,6.1214,6.6367,2.1482,7.0958,2.3192,0.3054,4.1662,1.4187,0.4004,0.8512,3.5327,0.0005,2.5502,0.5799,5.4661,0.9383,5.4311,6.663,4.3301,0.0017,4.7281,0.6231,0.8715,5.3889,0.1504,0.9282,0.0549,0.7586,0.4552,3.0664,3.1154,2.1749,6.899,0.4233,5.0745,3.6656,0.0021,2.9662,5.459,0.49,5.4551,2.1295,1.4661,1.8668,2.7688,2.739,1.2089,0.016,3.0278,2.1674,2.3852,0.0043,4.435,0.6558,0.7361]}
{"prompt":"The Trump administration plans to cap the number of refugees admitted to the United States in the coming year at 45,000 , two people with knowledge of the decision said on Tuesday , and advocates","text":"The Trump administration plans to cap the number of refugees admitted to the United States in the coming year at 45,000, two people with knowledge of the decision said on Tuesday, and advocates said the plan threatened to make it even more difficult for families who need to rely on U.S. immigration officials for help.\nThe move is largely symbolic, says David Sanger, the chief executive of the Trump Refugee Assistance Program.\nBut it could affect the lives of people who rely on the government for aid, such as a mother whose son was killed six months ago after his family was separated at the border.\n\u201cThis is essentially a statement that \u2018you will not know our humanity.\u2019 \u2026 And what is happening to all these young children is humanity itself,\u201d Sanger said about the administration\u2019s plan.\nThe Trump administration is currently running a refugee program that admitted more than 95,000 people to the United States during the first year of the president\u2019s administration.\nSome experts, including Sanger, said that the new caps for the refugee program will make it impossible to absorb the influx of refugees.\nTrump last week announced he was planning to take action soon. One person said the administration is preparing to move some refugees to other countries including Canada and Mexico.\nThe number of refugees admitted to the United States by the federal government is usually capped at 40,000, and Trump has vowed to reduce it to 25,000 while also capping the number of asylum seekers admitted to the nation.\nIn May, immigration officials began transferring some refugees into regional holding centers in Arizona and Texas and have been referring asylum seekers to Mexico and Canada for their deportation.\nSeparately, an employee of the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) said it would look at refugee referral agreements like the one signed by Mexico that allows U.S. officials to transfer asylum seekers to Mexico.\nThe Trump administration has taken a tough line on refugee policy, with criticism aimed at its attempts to shut the refugee program down and its proposed refugee refuges that could lead to torture.\nThe refugee program has allowed many Iraqis and refugees from the Middle East and other countries to cross into the United States and be resettled by different agencies in New York and some places in Florida.\nWhile Trump has taken aggressive steps to enforce border security and restrict immigration, he has also been an advocate for refugee acceptance and policy changes have made it easier to obtain refugee status.\nMany

{"prompt":"Kuwait replaced its oil , finance and defense ministers in a cabinet reshuffle on Monday , state news agency KUNA reported . Bakhit al-Rashidi was appointed the new oil minister of the OPEC member state","text":"Kuwait replaced its oil, finance and defense ministers in a cabinet reshuffle on Monday, state news agency KUNA reported. Bakhit al-Rashidi was appointed the new oil minister of the OPEC member state, replacing Abdul Rahman al-Faouzi who was dismissed. The cabinet also approved the resignation of Khalil al-Fekky, Kuwait\u2019s defense minister, and replaced him with Khalid Bin Salman al-Mafari, Kuwait\u2019s defense chief, KUNA said.\nIn an interview with KUNA, a member of the council of Emir, Sheik Sabah al-Khalidi al-Sabah, said that Saudi Arabia would not participate in OPEC\u2019s upcoming meeting that is scheduled in Vienna with Iran.\nShe said on Monday that Saudi Arabia does not know whether it will participate in the OPEC meeting with Iran because of \u201c Saudi Arabia\u2019s security concerns, \u201d according to the Kuwait Times. \u201cI do not know,\u201d said Khalidi to reporters, according to the newspaper. \u201cIt would be better if the security concerns that were there disappeared,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cIt may not be easy because Iran is now in Baghdad and Saudi and the US and the Europeans are also trying to put pressure on the Iraqi government.\u201d\nShe added that Saudi Arabia \u201c would like not to make any decisions that would embarrass him \u201d or the Gulf. \u201cWe are not in a position to say that we are going to participate in the meeting or not.\u201d\nSultan al-Shaikh added that Iran should understand that Saudi Arabia is a country \u201cthat is not a country you can talk to, especially in regard to security. \u2026 So we cannot give the impression that we are not aware of what is happening in the Iranian-Iraqi-Syrian region and the Saudi-Iraqi-US region.\u201d\nThe UAE\u2019s Finance Minister, Dr Mohammad Abdul Hamid al-Sahly, said in an interview with Reuters over the weekend, that he was confident that Kuwait and other OPEC members will support a freeze on oil production.\nHe added that the UAE had been making a serious effort to negotiate with Iran to persuade them to come to the forefront, the Dubai-based news outlet reported.\nThe UAE\u2019s oil minister, Ali Abdulla al-Kuwari, said last week that Saudi Arabia must provide a guarantee that it would not lower or increase its production levels even a little. The UAE\u2019s oil and gas minister added that Saudi Arabia is likely to cut its output because Saudi oil firms have lost profitability.","token_len":548,"entropy":[10.6686,13.1623,5.6306,6.4576,4.6581,9.2105,0.4264,4.5431,4.3006,1.9336,2.2089,4.2296,0.8487,0.0058,2.1947,2.1791,1.2798,8.2718,1.2393,0.0367,4.1068,4.1352,0.0652,0.5406,0.2175,9.3946,6.3124,8.1233,5.2047,0.0651,3.7962,3.0983,3.5448,2.3165,2.365,2.7256,1.5039,5.342,0.1106,4.7738,0.5598,4.7461,0.8029,0.9211,1.6789,4.5625,5.5575,3.1945,1.1707,0.0346,8.0116,4.0346,2.1249,2.5766,0.9463,4.1675,2.2614,2.7569,2.8422,2.6829,3.6286,1.5196,3.2227,0.0218,7.3922,0.7208,1.6585,0.0353,3.8497,6.3634,9.6934,0.8212,7.6571,13.1232,8.6171,3.4433,4.7483,0.0563,0.9331,1.6212,6.3936,1.9689,0.3245,4.3051,4.792,4.1032,3.4897,0.043,3.2644,5.2861,4.5823,0.4252,2.7859,0.5078,0.0037,0.0571,3.556,4.8506,2.253,2.2282,0.708,0.0041,1.4019,0.0891,0.8966,13.7821,2.7435,1.0388,0.5367,1.8167,0.4543,0.0004,0.3674,4.6559,3.5551,0.0295,0.5048,5.6965,0.9653,9.6456,9.9578,8.5905,0.3471,6.9443,1.0064,0.9247,0.0878,4.5171,1.8847,2.6867,5.4385,0.0603,3.3639,0.1305,0.7775,1.1772,1.6184,3.1819,0.0715,3.1234,1.5042,4.5544,0.0628,4.3796,8.2673,0.0471,0.0987,5.0973,2.6531,5.3091,1.7005,1.1629,3.4298,3.1893,5.8661,3.3917,1.1469,0.8481,5.3541,3.9567,5.5033,1.5701,0.2441,0.9817,0.0575,3.8457,0.042,5.308,2.416,1.9377,0.5925,0.8549,0.2245,0.5267,2.4932,0.2191,4.8878,0.2056,2.928,1.5177,13.2992,6.2603,3.615,1.0606,4.6727,0.0696,0.0815,5.0472,0.5488,2.0675,6.6017,7.1037,3.7453,0.0032,1.2474,1.9254,4.8379,0.3446,6.0058,1.0432,8.2965,3.4555,0.1308,0.9393,3.9639,7.8433,3.8491,2.7532,3.9334,3.8883,5.9451,5.0484,2.2304,2.772,0.0029,0.8397,2.9525,0.1275,2.3901,0.6255,3.4331,2.7588,0.4032,3.5668,1.076,2.4451,3.957,1.6592,4.4873,2.5836,4.3837,7.1489,1.1185,0.4811,0.726,1.3721,4.2385,1.7465,1.042,2.9082,1.9185,0.5858,4.0007,4.8957,1.8776,0.8054,5.22,4.4149,4.7359,1.2375,6.2175,2.6186,8.2308,1.6216,2.3733,6.239,3.207,3.6627,3.5642,2.0946,3.6609,0.5285,4.1039,4.3521,0.0674,4.7692,1.073,0.0576,1.7911,4.622,0.3182,1.5959,2.5768,1.4598,0.5064,3.0932,3.8198,0.3679,1.1468,0.1343,4.6789,0.8018,6.5676,4.2004,5.9529,0.2309,5.5646,0.9832,2.7742,2.2548,1.7599,6.5117,7.2724,4.3366,1.8041,4.7442,2.9581,3.6853,4.1416,2.0929,0.5361,2.1911,1.8019,1.3024,3.2096,1.3774,0.6435,0.3489,3.5053,1.0678,1.3277,1.4453,2.3639,0.0557,1.7217,0.2822,1.0066,0.8481,3.7822,2.7194,1.2841,1.2104,0.547,0.8489,5.5033,3.2993,1.0968,0.0626,3.9217,3.0289,0.7846,5.0877,0.3082,4.0118,4.3371,5.4067,0.5411,1.3595,0.202,1.7733,2.3682,3.5336,4.2384,0.4154,2.6615,1.2645,1.7135,2.1529,2.7459,7.6941,1.3847,4.162,1.4626,2.7543,7.3404,1.8781,6.1994,0.0224,3.6894,2.3045,7.8839,4.9455,2.2027,3.5473,4.2499,3.3142,0.5467,0.1308,1.0133,0.5607,1.321,5.509,0.3343,2.9895,1.0821,1.0474,0.7939,1.2641,4.3491,2.9613,0.7366,0.0905,3.7678,3.0495,3.7128,2.2932,2.5088,4.0217,0.5179,2.1966,0.0277,0.874,6.8452,3.3745,0.9428,1.4984,0.4691,0.2812,2.4626,4.4644,2.3521,0.2063,0.21,6.2219,0.6135,1.2884,4.7351,4.1989,4.3711,3.3852,0.1462,0.9595,0.0463,5.9485,7.6688,0.7015,1.2582,2.6959,0.9947,0.1548,0.4443,4.2562,7.3935,0.1012,0.1576,3.4938,1.0017,2.5226,2.0056,5.0071,0.3994,4.3901,3.0212,3.8014,1.4546,0.4497,1.6267,4.0449,3.4795,8.6389,0.6799,1.231,1.4462,1.6369,0.892,2.465,1.1777,0.327,2.0146,3.1661,3.8348,2.7881,5.367,2.7428,4.4227,0.7697,0.2399,4.6873,0.9433,1.459,2.5,6.9773,2.8896,0.2053,5.6663,0.5414,0.819,10.0727,3.5724,4.7728,4.774,1.1127,0.0111,3.0818,2.2955,0.6854,0.2049,0.5557,2.0463,1.201,1.8878,0.0108,0.0525,3.3694,0.3727,0.6126,3.4835,4.0446,2.6288,0.9724,0.9339,0.0334,5.4086,2.2368,3.6555,0.1901,1.1216,4.544,0.509,0.1569,1.7604,0.0472,5.1648,4.6651,2.5439,3.1082,1.0826,1.8247,1.6074,0.45,9.1136,5.6467,3.1109,1.3759,1.2004,3.684,5.416,6.4176,1.573,1.6286,3.0529,1.4704,1.0223,0.004,0.0403,1.8383,5.4849,0.6636,0.1779,5.0617,0.299,1.7164,0.0789,2.545,5.8007,0.059,4.0428,1.3809,1.5379,4.9425,3.8935,4.3433,4.7706,2.0554,4.6171,5.9787,1.6444]}
{"prompt":"Venezuela s state prosecutor confirmed on Thursday that former oil bosses Eulogio Del Pino and Nelson Martinez were detained in the early hours of Thursday as part of a sweeping graft probe that is ridding","text":"Venezuela s state prosecutor confirmed on Thursday that former oil bosses Eulogio Del Pino and Nelson Martinez were detained in the early hours of Thursday as part of a sweeping graft probe that is ridding Venezuela of key figures, state media reported.\nThey are accused of helping hide millions of dollars belonging to a Spanish oil company, Occidental Petroleum, whose owner was jailed recently in France, local TV channel Globovisi\u00f3n reported.\nThe investigation, called Operation Mangote, came about after a request from Spain. It initially began last year and was launched against the former President Nicolas Maduro, the Maduro government, and several private and public officials, Venezuelan television reported, but it has now been expanded.\n\"Our country is going through a process of radical change. We have taken the first steps in that direction after taking a radical decision. That decision has been recognized by the international community as legal and constitutional, \" tweeted the Minister of Foreign Affairs Jorge Arreaza.\nOn Thursday, the Supreme Court sentenced former Venezuela's National Oil Company chairman Carlos Osorio to four years and eight months in prison, and one of his associates, Alfredo Colmenares, to five years and 12 months at Caracas' Chuao prison. Del Pino, on the other hand, faced charges of conspiracy and money laundering.\n\"The president of Venezuelan company PDVSA (National Oil Company) is the person who led the investigation that started with the so-called \u2018oil-for-food' affair, \" Arreaza said. \"That was the reason for all of these arrests.\n\"Nelson Martinez was part of the cartel, \" he added. \"When Nelson Martinez disappeared, we were expecting it to continue, but now that he has been arrested, it's a different case. This guy will answer for many things in prison, he did everything well.\"\n\"The coup of Feb. 2, 2017, as opposed to its original intent, has now served as a pretext for these efforts to purge the country of its most important leaders,\" Arreaza wrote on Twitter.\nThe investigation has already seen former President Maduro jailed on charges of corruption and misappropriation of state properties, and other senior government officials detained after they were implicated in the scandal involving the so-called \"petro\" note.\nIn March, the head of the Supreme Court sent a letter to President Maduro stating that his country's political and legal system had been destroyed, Reuters reported, though the judge was not appointed by referendum and is not considered the President of Venezuela.\nOn Monday, Venezuela's interim government, led by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, announced that former President Maduro was no longer President of the nation.","token_len":550,"entropy":[12.2028,0.1386,9.6698,8.0666,6.6609,6.4055,1.6325,1.8704,0.2653,5.8984,7.3886,9.7143,7.4146,6.4898,0.336,0.4576,6.3634,4.0231,2.4279,0.7349,7.585,5.9087,1.6205,4.3332,1.668,2.0173,4.2036,0.1967,0.0506,2.0922,3.9044,1.4285,0.0007,0.749,5.7559,6.6422,1.1264,2.6712,2.8611,8.9546,2.9473,2.4422,0.1237,5.7991,2.561,3.4155,6.0489,0.9609,0.3098,0.1619,0.1878,18.5965,1.7934,1.555,0.0505,3.3381,5.4894,3.9191,0.2278,0.0257,6.4153,0.0016,2.3149,6.8666,1.2811,0.3212,1.8124,9.3843,0.0887,0.5648,0.7724,4.6002,5.0883,2.2614,2.7145,6.5251,2.5855,5.1447,3.3169,5.7858,4.6685,2.3116,6.1665,2.5455,5.5759,0.0034,0.1666,0.1551,0.2471,4.5221,3.0238,1.8563,5.0112,1.6471,9.2013,6.009,0.6366,5.2938,4.6963,0.6537,1.7153,6.6013,0.9601,5.9572,6.6986,2.8983,7.6988,3.3272,3.6749,0.829,2.7035,2.3368,3.2231,4.5179,2.2908,2.5071,4.6523,1.2172,0.0024,0.955,3.0562,6.1907,1.8459,2.7418,0.7749,3.8964,5.1807,3.5062,1.5342,1.8862,1.6906,7.2076,4.1205,0.9052,3.0632,4.1899,1.9049,1.1893,2.3789,1.2456,1.5711,2.07,0.1957,2.7264,4.5807,3.8926,0.9561,4.197,0.4933,0.4781,5.4666,0.7882,4.6071,1.4771,2.0499,1.4517,1.9296,5.1921,2.5785,2.6076,0.8968,2.18,2.3031,0.8259,6.3217,5.2342,2.1744,6.5407,2.6865,2.6991,4.1558,4.3108,2.0541,1.238,6.8377,0.6602,0.6178,1.7188,0.0362,2.7739,5.903,1.2907,3.2301,2.6631,6.3374,7.4851,2.5643,6.8424,0.209,2.9281,0.007,4.714,3.9036,2.9481,0.7874,1.3086,0.21,4.1408,0.9983,0.2246,1.5251,4.7603,0.0499,4.4536,2.9076,4.7278,2.3122,4.7661,3.5554,0.7512,3.5602,3.8959,6.5411,0.223,1.9709,3.4339,0.1606,2.6051,2.679,0.0111,0.1787,0.1977,1.6354,2.0363,5.1179,3.5509,1.2442,3.3348,1.5446,5.0961,0.0385,6.5994,5.6565,8.0463,0.3309,1.5318,2.1494,0.1174,0.9951,3.4471,0.0043,6.3623,8.479,0.004,0.5939,14.2356,8.0055,1.6675,0.731,7.8348,0.0743,0.0008,1.5664,5.871,0.6984,0.0203,0.0049,0.0123,4.7177,3.9309,0.2334,3.5937,2.0146,2.3284,0.0176,1.111,0.4825,2.9284,1.7861,4.9548,1.9393,6.6069,6.6226,6.6872,0.0026,0.0001,2.9256,2.898,0.4347,0.2856,0.5357,1.9679,3.5829,3.7639,0.923,4.2449,0.7399,2.5531,3.2881,3.1736,4.1048,0.9118,6.4888,0.038,0.0011,13.4846,7.9752,6.8802,3.3818,2.5412,0.03,2.2974,6.4327,6.2721,2.0914,3.1914,3.8676,0.0374,0.0084,0.7882,0.6617,1.2168,3.8228,2.2963,1.2382,4.1631,1.8951,4.6983,1.8965,2.5814,2.186,0.9011,4.1668,1.9902,7.028,0.2336,0.1579,1.5287,5.0833,0.0019,0.7167,5.447,1.7267,4.5869,1.0357,1.2866,0.2898,0.9619,4.6125,5.4564,1.3968,5.4399,0.5156,2.0545,2.2818,5.4971,3.9445,0.8898,4.7661,1.8688,0.4689,2.7155,3.1418,1.4573,1.4238,0.7782,1.6944,0.3873,1.881,1.246,3.0083,2.6197,4.1502,0.7691,3.4991,6.4003,4.3122,7.7434,1.59,6.4828,1.9691,3.5069,4.8273,1.6282,3.3015,5.4231,2.9569,4.4756,1.6695,0.2917,3.3678,2.119,5.9578,4.376,7.5801,0.2236,3.2451,1.3292,3.163,1.1876,6.4926,4.528,0.0024,5.0979,5.1963,4.5381,0.6974,3.0296,4.6922,6.6778,0.6882,0.4925,4.0798,0.5048,5.338,5.822,1.2,4.9948,0.9036,2.3096,0.4792,2.8609,2.0673,1.3162,2.6023,0.7597,2.9057,0.0064,0.0039,4.7284,2.365,0.527,0.2591,0.594,1.8525,2.8738,2.2103,3.7308,3.4735,5.453,1.6064,3.9547,4.0183,2.408,1.3598,0.4292,1.2542,1.1425,4.944,0.3585,0.1783,0.1669,0.855,7.5089,0.9927,1.7816,4.5983,3.5419,2.8028,0.1934,3.2204,4.122,2.7972,1.3709,2.5131,0.0663,1.7509,3.3381,4.6365,1.5589,5.7866,0.001,0.0008,1.7977,6.4367,0.5485,5.0582,9.9639,1.5212,0.7599,3.2574,3.3436,0.2051,1.6412,4.0329,0.004,1.028,5.1015,0.1222,6.1777,0.5434,0.4856,0.2992,2.1722,0.88,4.1739,0.2597,2.5374,2.8804,1.9447,4.5184,2.3,3.2374,0.6784,1.9653,0.8609,4.9486,2.1477,5.8492,0.0805,1.4397,4.5972,1.6125,5.3373,3.4538,0.9697,5.3793,0.8966,12.5353,3.2659,3.7443,1.8124,2.7453,3.4571,4.8166,3.1281,0.9112,0.3002,0.6182,3.0532,3.1496,0.0756,3.2074,0.3358,5.6984,2.3507,3.2411,2.1554,0.0118,2.7543,2.6415,2.1693,1.0664,0.7492,0.512,0.1105,1.8165,1.0184,4.2214,0.9856,2.0674,2.1708,3.9386,0.0008,4.9548,1.19,0.2349,3.6763,0.7476]}
{"prompt":"The Singapore government s laws limiting critical speech and peaceful assembly are overly broad and make the country a repressive place severely restricting what can be said and published , Human Rights Watch said on","text":"The Singapore government s laws limiting critical speech and peaceful assembly are overly broad and make the country a repressive place severely restricting what can be said and published, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday.\nThe government was last year criticised for restricting the freedom of the press. Many media companies, including local and foreign newspapers and news agencies, were forced to close down.\nHuawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker has been criticised for allegedly using backdoors in its products that allow Beijing to spy on users.\nThe latest crackdown has come just days after US President Barack Obama told Chinese president Xi Jinping his country will not be allowed to be used as a security \"backdoor\" from overseas.\nUnder the laws, the offence of \"offending patriotism and national dignity \" carries a penalty of a 15-year jail term or a $100,000 fine.\n\"The crackdown on human rights violations and media freedom is an indication of the government remaining dogmatic in it's stance to restrict the free speech,\" Sarah Leah Whittingstall, Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.\n\"There are many instances of this over-broad law being challenged and overturned in court so it remains unclear why the government chose to go ahead with the penalty this time.\"\nThere are hundreds of bloggers, cartoonists, film-makers and other creative artists who have been arrested, imprisoned, fined or banned in the Republic in recent years.\nThese acts have also gone unpunished and public support for independent media has dropped significantly, the report said.\nThe annual report showed that despite the many achievements in the push against corruption, there is a worrying failure in tackling structural issues.\nThe government has made some achievements that have given confidence to both citizens and others that it is on the ball in the fight against corruption. Despite this, Singapore's standing in international corruption rankings remains among the very worst, it stated.\nThe US State Department published the latest Corruption Perceptions Index on Wednesday which placed Singapore 42 out of a total of 175 countries.\nThe report also noted that Singapore's \"unsatisfactory\" efforts in tackling structural barriers that perpetuate corruption in state-owned enterprises led to a drop in Singapore's rating from a previous 40-point to 45-point improvement.\nThe report said corruption remains a widespread problem despite the Government announcing plans yesterday to tighten penalties against offenders and establish a new enforcement agency to tackle the growing problem.\nThe report also criticized the government for poor policy implementation and ineffective laws, saying government policy to promote efficiency and transparency has not been put into effect.\nSingapore's corruption crisis has brought into question Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong' s political ambitions and his government strategy in combatting crime.","token_len":550,"entropy":[11.0238,2.9647,11.3908,11.684,6.915,10.2028,5.616,1.8162,6.6945,1.1249,2.031,7.2823,0.6229,0.9089,5.6168,3.0067,3.447,2.2563,6.2713,2.4165,11.4849,5.891,4.48,1.5231,0.22,1.0351,1.5192,5.7112,2.8733,7.4801,0.0667,0.0397,0.3268,2.2219,1.9964,0.0704,0.2889,14.1457,1.5304,5.189,6.0215,1.0328,4.4563,0.5924,3.5874,2.0082,1.2836,0.1436,2.4767,0.1403,3.7,6.4289,3.4897,4.4805,2.1788,0.4046,6.2894,2.5892,1.2877,3.0115,2.9204,3.6933,1.8803,0.1351,1.7249,2.562,0.1135,2.3277,3.7865,2.3238,0.3579,12.0663,3.0447,1.5499,1.6863,0.8014,0.0079,1.5275,4.6839,7.7449,0.7155,7.7697,1.6677,3.1844,0.494,5.6914,3.4099,8.5214,0.2534,1.0653,0.4277,2.8034,2.5541,0.7666,7.1143,0.271,2.2324,0.0227,2.6651,1.2476,0.5701,1.754,5.1013,2.5019,3.374,2.2117,3.2405,0.9812,0.0912,5.6318,1.0286,1.0936,0.0021,4.645,2.2135,3.8266,0.0128,0.0037,5.0105,0.849,2.4997,1.9749,2.8198,3.6226,0.0437,5.2957,4.8439,1.0198,0.2187,7.0861,3.6001,3.4512,1.8812,0.5651,7.0408,6.9395,0.5729,0.3759,5.8277,0.8155,5.2318,0.5961,1.955,9.8385,0.99,0.7784,5.4636,0.4659,8.444,3.5738,2.7686,4.3428,8.2368,1.9654,0.1594,2.9254,0.0392,3.8373,5.6915,0.0929,0.1095,1.0607,0.5466,2.6382,0.6657,3.4891,2.6391,0.2578,0.0005,0.0071,0.4698,0.5402,2.8087,1.5983,4.7253,1.3999,4.7264,0.0116,3.5427,2.7472,4.3823,1.0333,1.2698,2.8816,4.9092,0.6907,0.9065,2.2362,12.5991,9.8029,0.0194,2.0048,7.1777,0.1416,2.4839,3.8872,3.8302,2.0947,1.6277,2.1834,5.5085,6.0102,2.2722,0.0022,7.494,2.6707,0.0502,2.6138,0.4844,2.7675,0.4094,0.0007,0.0004,0.1426,0.1667,0.3038,0.0406,0.1228,0.1604,0.2827,1.5995,3.9284,1.681,2.8968,4.2865,0.9442,4.4732,5.2323,1.7008,2.7839,2.9991,3.066,6.8399,2.6073,5.0561,1.3497,1.7954,6.2603,1.6561,4.0047,2.4344,3.4192,0.8569,0.5722,4.6136,0.15,3.7375,2.7223,0.2128,1.6182,9.2297,5.1685,0.3469,0.9544,0.1903,5.6204,1.4839,4.9941,0.0213,5.032,1.3301,6.3719,0.0216,0.8668,4.8614,2.9981,0.0485,0.6472,2.0832,4.8264,3.9689,1.187,1.0179,0.7324,2.3193,2.4166,2.7268,1.7084,3.4051,0.6021,4.3568,2.6463,1.3219,7.1666,4.7047,0.6214,0.3478,1.0086,0.5656,7.3474,6.1652,2.2617,4.2766,6.3625,1.0628,0.0002,0.0002,3.8825,6.1981,4.9653,0.2366,6.1926,1.1624,0.7244,3.3734,3.6678,1.7182,2.551,2.5324,0.1935,0.093,0.2561,1.7152,6.7942,2.2226,4.3916,0.5629,5.5983,1.3627,6.714,6.5435,2.5794,1.4136,6.561,3.4478,4.2752,0.9143,2.588,1.6487,2.4787,4.6066,5.3299,2.268,3.6712,7.41,2.9766,2.2939,0.5274,1.747,1.4424,1.3992,3.51,3.6788,5.8062,4.2464,1.276,5.0694,5.039,0.1249,6.7284,3.5288,0.1028,6.7879,4.0218,3.9678,1.4227,4.5345,0.8366,8.9635,2.2842,1.6331,1.1174,0.0546,0.5385,0.9766,6.8552,2.9116,0.2722,6.3556,1.3214,6.6465,1.0737,2.1917,7.1183,3.7731,1.9274,5.0429,0.0492,6.5675,0.62,2.9156,2.8763,5.6089,0.8874,0.3072,1.5648,5.1566,2.4528,0.0041,5.7027,2.6701,3.4641,3.3164,0.7188,0.0009,0.4303,2.2017,2.0726,4.1955,5.2928,0.2203,7.1674,5.2827,0.0064,3.9066,1.5258,0.104,6.0897,0.1194,1.4692,1.0392,1.3713,1.7969,1.963,2.9417,0.2953,2.1651,1.4855,3.5891,8.7788,1.8341,0.0536,2.2809,7.2893,2.4044,1.9667,6.9416,6.8892,4.2929,7.1838,1.5625,2.7696,5.3982,0.9505,0.7804,0.6443,4.1869,0.1766,1.8044,2.0022,0.0921,5.1326,0.2425,4.0985,0.833,2.3423,7.757,7.9484,2.9373,1.0142,1.6227,4.9713,0.2847,0.0403,8.2129,0.8397,0.3662,1.5161,1.3967,1.6932,4.8132,4.0563,0.8541,5.6597,0.2196,5.3625,1.4246,4.8485,7.4896,2.961,7.3297,0.1472,4.2416,3.0865,2.8168,4.9227,2.1652,5.6439,0.9971,2.5656,5.5554,2.9462,1.093,2.5866,1.7683,5.1361,0.4558,0.2552,0.4331,1.5888,1.3742,1.4963,4.9942,0.4671,1.4843,0.7944,7.0047,4.5996,4.294,1.231,5.2887,5.2923,2.3041,2.484,4.9649,3.8794,3.9842,4.1542,7.0159,0.9991,1.5471,2.065,2.5652,0.8202,5.3896,1.8041,2.3519,0.4372,0.3359,4.3487,0.0001,1.0682,4.8241,5.2403,1.305,4.8439,4.8167,1.7919,6.6049,0.0038,0.0838,0.101,0.0039,0.0001,0.0006,0.0005,7.8179,4.3563,5.4319,2.9515,1.4589,1.8309,3.8359,8.2136,3.2162,8.3386,0.0027,5.326,1.0275]}

Churches in Wenzhou started teaching","text":"When authorities in China s southeastern city of Wenzhou outlawed Sunday School earlier this year, Christian parents determined their children must still learn about Jesus and the Bible. Churches in Wenzhou started teaching children Sunday School in their homes over the past few years.\nA few years ago, I went on the Christian mission trip to the Philippines, and it was there that I truly heard the heart of God for me. God sent this boy to my class about seven months ago, and God put his hands on him, and he lost his first toe due to an accident. We started visiting him on Sundays and he was very shy, and he just didn\u2019t think anyone would come visit and give him a toe nail. So he would come to the front of my classroom and I would sit in the chair he was sitting in, and he would look at both of my legs, and he never let me touch his feet.\nFor more than three decades now, my mom, dad and I have been raising our five children: Andrew, Jacob, Nathan, Ethan and Zach. When Zach turned three years old on May 30, 2001, he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer. Zach battled for a few years, but, unfortunately, he is now no longer here.\nThe world, its history and its inhabitants are not as new to us as it may seem. The Bible talks about them, too. \u201cIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\u201d Genesis 1:1 God, the Creator of the Universe, has spoken about us too. He has talked to us from the beginning.\nWe live in the middle of a new millennium \u2013 one in which the Bible calls us a generation of witnesses. We are facing a time of great change. We are now in the midst of a global age that has brought its\u2019 own issues. There are political problems, financial troubles, technological change and environmental degradation. Our world seems to be spiraling out of control, and many families and individuals are suffering under these problems. Our goal this week is to look at some of the things we can do in this world and in our own lives, to show God\u2019s love and to share His gospel.\nLast fall, my mother-in-law and grandfather were traveling back to the Philippines from the United States on a Korean company airliner. The airliner is a Boeing 727, and it was on its last leg to the Philippines. The pilot decided to try to head for a different destination because he thought he could go in higher at that location. Shortly after he made that decision, the airplane turned around and headed back to the original destination, in Seoul. The pilot was very scared.","token_len":550,"entropy":[9.2565,3.8497,5.114,9.6797,16.6886,3.4348,0.1509,4.777,1.4724,0.0029,9.7431,6.7623,7.7576,10.1427,0.1042,1.3394,0.5831,9.0122,3.1622,8.8971,3.473,0.5807,4.0771,4.7727,3.813,3.5142,3.3012,2.2938,2.105,2.2294,1.0175,8.4014,1.5461,1.8815,0.0119,0.0013,6.0295,3.2079,3.4203,3.8558,0.8003,1.51,5.6088,2.4289,4.938,0.1985,0.7392,1.614,0.4831,0.8889,0.9563,13.5837,4.0746,1.8795,0.0689,0.1571,5.2288,3.2272,3.7956,3.4894,5.806,4.4615,2.0969,0.4553,2.6202,3.2849,1.8144,1.6464,3.5552,0.5839,3.6848,0.4276,0.2791,8.3629,4.3873,1.0897,6.6751,1.4659,4.2859,4.8519,4.539,0.3946,5.0893,3.8427,4.4714,5.9232,1.0574,3.6631,8.2048,5.2324,3.6893,1.8428,0.0695,1.1074,0.6465,5.0722,5.8417,3.0686,3.3729,0.3721,1.6284,1.8889,0.6332,1.2486,7.1043,0.8285,6.2739,8.6706,6.8569,0.006,2.6076,1.8571,0.629,4.0108,5.2769,6.6101,2.3305,3.5922,3.4642,2.2322,1.2936,1.7076,2.3295,6.1791,1.5784,1.0737,1.6038,4.1074,2.3237,13.8899,6.6935,0.9563,4.8611,5.7516,0.4813,4.3078,3.8603,4.1,4.2548,0.2803,0.9045,4.8547,8.529,0.5431,2.9027,2.5269,5.9002,3.2305,1.7637,1.9932,5.6222,1.2248,2.4806,1.6213,1.0385,3.76,0.4543,2.8984,2.3766,1.037,3.8885,4.9347,0.2946,0.498,1.2833,0.9557,0.2925,0.8135,0.3023,3.8181,0.5716,8.1726,0.5979,1.4398,3.8156,1.2227,0.2232,0.7231,5.4535,4.9471,1.4612,0.9671,1.6875,2.5185,0.6209,2.387,5.2728,4.7255,1.3677,2.6112,2.8081,2.424,0.1284,2.4985,4.8363,2.6556,4.1692,1.4364,0.5764,0.1667,0.6904,4.6448,1.4446,4.9089,1.1277,6.8446,7.0501,0.158,5.1128,0.1447,5.9339,0.2699,5.9039,1.4549,5.1706,0.6228,3.9382,6.1404,5.4602,2.579,1.42,0.0091,4.9908,2.8456,3.4895,0.5372,5.693,0.0617,1.3265,1.2015,1.8007,0.0572,2.1083,1.5079,1.5685,0.003,5.1204,1.8071,0.7674,4.5084,7.5088,2.4415,2.658,2.216,1.4006,1.4019,0.7965,5.4729,5.3015,0.1054,1.4135,4.6141,1.4524,6.0171,0.0484,6.8952,0.5996,1.4386,2.9849,5.251,4.299,6.1057,4.4602,0.6612,1.3278,6.8037,1.4198,3.8989,3.8102,7.899,1.2231,2.0538,0.3558,2.6075,2.9849,0.2562,0.3844,2.4032,3.607,6.6808,0.302,5.7512,1.6738,5.5518,0.7019,12.4197,6.057,6.1894,1.2425,3.0759,2.6261,0.7291,1.015,0.6527,0.0216,0.0422,0.0048,1.0506,6.2657,7.2246,6.8128,1.1307,0.0971,2.794,7.6418,4.7041,1.914,1.4302,0.7747,0.6889,2.6026,0.2121,4.3289,3.9675,2.3024,3.1455,7.3977,0.6363,1.8833,2.1298,3.8924,4.2341,0.2531,4.5752,0.9302,0.6908,1.2383,3.0204,2.6918,3.3035,0.3331,1.9146,5.2082,0.1979,1.5509,4.6337,4.5263,6.6362,3.7769,1.638,0.0207,1.9091,3.1895,5.0324,0.8279,4.6779,3.3147,1.3236,6.0341,1.3746,1.7385,1.0998,5.6387,1.1293,3.3371,0.9948,1.9751,0.7507,1.1005,1.8063,0.6922,4.289,2.4653,1.0828,1.3007,0.002,0.8228,3.8019,4.3784,3.961,2.246,2.2763,5.7834,19.0631,2.475,10.7901,5.6438,1.8178,4.1982,0.9155,6.0932,3.9562,1.169,4.9942,3.7176,0.3484,6.2815,3.4299,1.2725,3.9459,3.3278,0.63,3.6335,3.6955,6.1709,0.4815,0.3258,4.8919,0.0361,0.7932,0.013,0.0393,1.8414,0.7876,3.9556,5.0481,2.7055,3.4861,0.4186,3.2968,4.8873,3.0885,2.55,0.1603,3.9694,7.0667,5.8014,2.4132,0.2356,0.1457,5.8903,0.8087,3.1336,0.257,0.6421,3.7753,1.5137,0.9367,0.1962,4.4193,2.7946,2.9998,2.5757,5.3464,1.8776,1.341,0.8455,3.1763,1.5165,4.3634,3.8612,5.9347,0.447,2.667,1.2262,0.9953,3.0798,3.6284,3.3973,5.5578,1.9119,0.5336,6.5577,4.0436,0.3184,3.4316,2.3484,3.6324,0.0046,0.004,0.0018,1.9668,7.6432,2.8963,4.9298,4.0825,0.7017,2.1118,1.0388,3.0551,2.3003,1.8815,0.1078,4.1777,0.703,9.2613,7.1324,9.3078,0.8148,2.4826,6.0829,5.2595,2.1535,1.2936,1.4601,2.2605,1.4557,0.8207,2.4827,1.3028,3.8249,1.1649,4.8976,1.9852,4.0602,1.3163,3.125,0.6958,1.8827,4.4523,4.8139,0.347,4.7223,1.1421,6.7702,2.3982,2.8087,3.4352,1.4697,3.4301,1.0482,2.9922,1.5199,1.5462,3.9018,4.0667,8.5863,6.8115,4.3738,5.3228,0.6753,6.5705,0.4511,2.3189,2.3748,1.4998,0.2793,0.0776,1.5007,3.7627,5.0039,1.6472,0.4973,2.9469,1.9334,0.3693,0.9275,5.8488,0.4022,2.0779,4.3903,6.5686,0.6876,1.9889,2.4651,2.2499,3.1943,3.5547,2.0891]}
{"prompt":"Canadian designer Line the Label shot to prominence on Monday after U.S. actress Meghan Markle wore a coat from the brand in her first public appearance after her engagement to Britain s Prince Harry .","text":"Canadian designer Line the Label shot to prominence on Monday after U.S. actress Meghan Markle wore a coat from the brand in her first public appearance after her engagement to Britain s Prince Harry. The Markle coat, a classic trench coat with a wide, bell-shaped lapel, was modeled in a muted camel color on a stunning, fitted black dress by Clare Waight Keller, the creative director and designer. Meghan wore the coat, which retails for $1,950, as she attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last week in the United Kingdom. Meghan wore the elegant piece to her first-ever public appearance out of her home country, while Markle s fianc\u00e9, Harry, stayed at a Los Angeles luxury hotel while waiting for his new position as a prince and part of the monarchy. He was also said to be planning an elaborate royal exit during which he would hand over the reins of the royal family to Meghan and the Duchess of Sussex. The coat s provenance goes back to Meghan s wedding dress. Fashion brand Dior created Meghan s wedding dress in 2002, and it was customized to be made by a French tailor, Pierre-Emmanuel Martin, who is also known for his work on other celebrity wedding ensembles, including the dress Jennifer Lopez wore to her second wedding to former fianc\u00e9 Marc Anthony. Meghan wore the coat during her first royal appearance since it came out in 2016 in a colorway that was a favorite of her grandparents, the late King and Queen.\nI\u2019m having a hard time doing anything lately. I have been feeling unmotivated as I try to set up my new office space but I think I do not have many options left, other than to try to get it in shape. I know I need new furniture and shelves, and probably new computers. But with my current computer, it just does not work right. Every once in a while I have to reset it but it takes hours. Any suggestions on how I can get something that is working properly? I use it a lot for research because I teach theology. But, it just does not make my life any easier.\nI could try and get a second computer, but I don\u2019t have any other work to do, and then maybe I\u2019ll start getting organized again, but, I am still feeling unmotivated.

{"prompt":"Seven European Union states urged Romania s ruling coalition on Thursday to avoid legislation that could weaken its judiciary and the fight against corruption , hours after senators approved a contentious overhaul of the justice","text":"Seven European Union states urged Romania s ruling coalition on Thursday to avoid legislation that could weaken its judiciary and the fight against corruption, hours after senators approved a contentious overhaul of the justice system.\n\u201cWe call on you, the government, to resist and fight against this harmful legislation, especially if it passes,\u201d said a joint statement issued by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Sweden and Ireland.\nThe new law will allow judges to dismiss prosecutors for \u201cpolitical motives\u201d and the government can order any judge to be removed from their post, if they object to the prosecution of a politically related case. That will \u201cimpede the independence of judges and hamper the fight against corruption,\u201d the statement said, adding that it would \u201craise concern about accountability, transparency, the fairness of criminal proceedings and respect for the rule of law.\u201d\nThe move has sparked a debate on international justice standards over whether a government-initiated mechanism to sack an independent prosecutor could have been used to eliminate Mr Viorel Ghenea, a long-standing critic of President Roxana Popa. Mr Viorel Ghenea was the first prosecutor appointed in Romania after the 2011 revolution that ousted long-time communist leader Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu.\nThe proposed law is based on reforms introduced by the government of former liberal prime minister Victor Ponta, who now has a seat in the opposition.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a fierce opponent of this measure and I\u2019ve taken the strongest stand against it. It\u2019s a dangerous step that would jeopardise a large part of public confidence in the judiciary. In the next month, I support my former comrades in the Justice and Interior Affairs Commissions and I call on other political groups in Parliament as well to do the same,\u201d he added.\nThe prime minister, Elena Codru\u021b\u0103, denied accusations that a move to sack senior prosecutors would allow Mr Ghenea to escape the banishment imposed in 2011 by Romanian authorities after he published an article critical of Mr Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s regime. Mr Ghenea, who has denied the charges, spent two years in exile.\nEarlier, the opposition Social-Democrats party urged the government not to support the draft law.\n\u201cIt is our opinion that a government that wants to protect some criminals should not be seen as defending law and order,\u201d party leader Adrian Nastase said.\nMr Viorel Ghenea and other prosecutors fear that by weakening the independence of judges, laws enacted by the government could undermine prosecutors who would feel unbound by their duties to uphold law.","token_len":551,"entropy":[9.0373,3.6214,1.98,9.3791,7.4718,12.7577,8.3909,2.8699,4.5086,2.0578,0.0957,5.4079,8.8425,0.9639,1.3253,5.0907,1.4819,4.7992,1.2977,3.631,7.0578,0.1178,0.9387,2.4046,8.2547,0.1063,8.1315,4.5195,0.8929,7.0146,5.394,0.162,0.5453,4.6916,0.1709,0.5145,0.1746,18.275,8.0157,8.4823,3.742,0.2917,3.3454,3.4117,1.4687,4.4852,1.5437,0.4544,5.6922,3.445,4.7371,2.031,2.245,4.5742,1.1857,2.1352,3.8384,2.6827,0.626,3.6026,3.5625,11.3442,8.4812,1.9565,3.6053,3.339,0.1013,2.0575,0.1001,5.0515,0.4355,3.5791,0.9585,0.6492,1.6416,0.7508,3.5853,0.6726,3.3017,0.527,4.8047,0.2271,0.2747,2.5275,3.63,1.2784,2.3641,2.6823,1.5086,0.2576,4.0734,6.5429,3.0023,15.0144,0.5511,7.1587,5.0064,0.4187,2.7525,1.4025,4.1439,3.2576,3.7366,4.7655,4.4704,2.743,0.6235,3.6216,1.6095,1.0634,4.9868,1.9659,2.4943,3.9373,0.9537,6.8319,0.4375,1.408,3.9823,2.1262,1.2078,6.646,5.5517,1.8635,0.3336,5.6894,2.7335,13.2784,0.0318,4.2974,4.3723,0.0014,0.9988,4.0717,0.1954,2.2081,1.5464,6.364,0.0004,1.1195,4.4461,0.0775,0.1878,1.5862,6.1668,0.6821,0.952,0.8319,0.5115,3.0423,1.1273,0.2434,1.8618,1.0646,8.5764,0.0241,4.7171,5.1043,1.2833,6.5159,2.737,3.0449,1.7096,4.1985,5.0287,0.1843,3.8472,1.8398,0.3327,5.167,0.076,1.449,0.4241,0.0029,0.0015,0.6368,5.0314,2.7382,0.197,1.517,3.4128,3.6296,2.712,1.8671,3.1633,1.8256,5.9763,4.1449,3.574,4.3388,1.889,3.4516,3.3744,4.4554,3.7295,0.6125,0.001,7.1021,1.8552,8.8012,4.1143,3.2607,0.5816,2.7738,3.6886,1.4049,1.033,0.704,5.4686,7.7082,10.0845,5.3915,2.7779,7.0628,10.2457,1.1533,1.3018,1.3386,5.7476,0.0605,1.7146,2.4037,0.0744,4.5809,10.3274,1.2614,4.5196,5.8912,1.6404,3.486,0.7169,0.0018,0.0018,1.9534,0.0156,0.0007,2.1982,3.9825,1.9788,3.0686,3.1375,2.3212,0.7164,2.9336,1.1342,4.1101,2.7221,2.6066,1.5006,8.2027,0.0385,0.8977,3.5103,1.1144,1.6711,0.0004,0.7277,0.0308,0.026,0.0112,0.0375,0.0005,0.3987,0.3784,1.5019,5.7202,1.8939,2.6304,3.9593,0.0533,4.0639,2.4679,0.6592,1.0862,2.6858,2.7393,1.418,8.035,3.4658,0.0061,1.9919,0.1149,0.0034,1.4181,0.6585,6.1547,3.2995,1.89,3.1192,0.778,0.739,5.6787,2.3863,1.1894,2.11,0.1768,4.6029,9.5047,8.6372,6.6327,4.821,2.4374,1.7236,5.8308,2.0061,0.0425,3.385,3.952,2.4013,1.4783,3.2933,1.3518,2.0405,4.8476,2.0556,3.4649,1.9506,1.5314,0.7862,1.4569,3.3976,1.767,0.7599,1.1913,1.6487,4.5264,1.3389,1.4768,2.5763,3.3705,2.0073,4.3733,6.1611,0.736,0.002,5.2213,1.9689,0.2238,0.5414,1.3793,1.41,4.7317,1.9672,4.8907,6.1605,0.6937,1.4579,6.669,5.6423,5.1959,4.6902,1.2097,0.8251,5.5126,1.4859,4.403,3.931,8.14,0.7719,2.0656,2.2847,4.4816,0.248,5.8237,3.8021,3.3736,2.5438,5.0105,5.2978,0.0109,1.746,4.2843,0.2199,0.0044,2.7943,0.2795,1.2433,5.7231,1.9362,0.1152,0.3042,1.8239,6.2684,0.0182,2.2989,10.0152,12.7046,7.0146,2.3786,1.7792,4.507,0.1127,0.3883,6.8975,4.0687,0.7804,4.2635,4.1992,0.5745,3.4919,6.9177,1.1998,1.7868,5.2844,1.5767,2.3584,0.0152,0.0009,0.1272,4.4175,2.8085,6.2127,5.5707,7.9828,4.2341,2.9708,2.0239,5.1867,3.1099,3.9641,1.7865,7.1005,2.2222,1.7495,3.2509,0.0068,1.6362,2.8945,0.0078,0.0006,0.0004,0.0004,0.0008,5.7804,2.2535,3.9205,3.6497,0.4381,3.8644,0.8488,0.0075,0.0012,2.1157,0.8096,1.9278,3.9083,2.1892,1.1395,0.193,6.0047,2.9311,0.3714,0.3343,3.5475,3.0087,0.401,5.8558,1.7988,1.7434,4.4917,3.1969,4.5878,1.6122,4.3054,5.049,0.9763,0.7327,3.2506,0.0031,5.5887,0.7744,4.6284,0.683,1.2198,1.0046,1.5331,0.2535,3.2502,1.0015,4.2208,4.0115,0.0834,2.9027,2.8861,1.1683,4.0716,0.1435,3.7698,6.2983,5.2352,3.1995,0.8874,1.7514,5.3138,0.4083,5.5842,5.6432,0.7553,0.0502,1.5265,0.6428,0.6698,4.9192,1.7132,5.9966,4.2031,2.2126,4.0256,1.3591,0.8577,0.4694,3.6942,3.7225,0.0056,0.003,0.0741,0.0239,0.0007,3.9331,2.1172,3.0586,7.045,0.9477,5.6152,5.1857,0.7499,3.4931,0.0607,1.4436,0.7007,6.3763,5.8356,0.8773,0.7594,1.1027,0.8252,2.5074,5.2293,4.7228,4.5987,7.0048,6.3587,4.8754,0.4031,2.2771,3.7507,2.4736,2.8474,3.4428,1.0217]}
{"prompt":"Bulgaria has asked Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG to overhaul and maintain its 15 aged MiG-29 fighter jets in a four-year deal worth up to 81.3 million levs ( $ 49 million ) , the country","text":"Bulgaria has asked Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG to overhaul and maintain its 15 aged MiG-29 fighter jets in a four-year deal worth up to 81.3 million levs ( $ 49 million ), the country\u2019s defence ministry said on July 1. The request came amid a recent political crisis within the Defence Ministry, where two members resigned. The move followed comments by a deputy defence minister that the ministry was reluctant to buy a new and promising combat aircraft because of a lack of trained personnel.\nThe MiG-29s are the primary strike aircraft employed by the air force. Russia boasts of the world's largest fleet of MiG-29s - almost 450 fighters - of which about 150 have served for more than 20 years. The fighter is used both for training its pilots and providing air support for ground troops. It is also capable of escorting an bomber, conducting escort missions, or carrying out close-air operations.\nRussian planes have over the years successfully carried out strikes against Taliban and al-Qaeda strongholds. The MiG-29 has also had a hand in several major wars including the 1991 1991 Persian Gulf War. In 2004, the United States bought 100 of the planes at a price of $ 225 million. However, the Russian military has long lamented a lack of skilled pilots. It is currently considering acquiring new MiG-29s from Turkey.\nIn the meantime, it will work on equipping the MiG-29s with anti-air warfare and targeting missiles in order to upgrade the fighters to an appropriate level. This effort is part of a new programme approved in 2007 under which some 200 MiG-29s will be upgraded. This work is expected to begin in the fourth quarter.\nThe new MiG-29s will be equipped with radar and weapons that are superior to those of the upgraded MiG-29s currently in service, a statement by the ministry said.\nIn 2007, a second programme for the modernisation of MiG-29s will begin. It is likely to be worth $ 600 million over five years, including radar, electronic and weapon systems, and spare parts, but does not include other modernisation.\nSpectacular views and a private back country setting makes this a rare find!

{"prompt":"Billionaire Marcelo Odebrecht , the highest-profile executive imprisoned in Brazil s massive graft scandal , was released from jail on Tuesday to continue his sentence for corruption under house arrest , according to a federal","text":"Billionaire Marcelo Odebrecht, the highest-profile executive imprisoned in Brazil s massive graft scandal, was released from jail on Tuesday to continue his sentence for corruption under house arrest, according to a federal judge.He was freed after posting $300,000 in cash bail, and under house arrest where he must keep at least 25 feet off the ground from his cell in an undisclosed location, the judge said.No additional details, including his location, were given.The jailed president of Brazil s biggest contractor Odebrecht will remain on house arrest for the rest of his life, even though a judge has ordered that he immediately be transferred to jail.Odebrecht was sentenced at the end of September to 17 years in prison for bribes paid to politicians and public officials to win major public works contracts.The judge said earlier this year that the company s CEO, Marcelo Odebrecht, would serve his prison term starting on Dec. 3.Marcelo reportedly has not visited his brother Alvaro, 74, in prison.Asked about Alvaro s incarceration, Odebrecht said last month he was \" very proud \" of his jailed brother.\u00c1lvaro is one of 22 former senior executives to have been arrested and sent to prison in all three regional divisions of Brazil s second-biggest corruption scandal, which has crippled the economy and led former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva to suspend campaign events for more than a week to concentrate on his defense.In November, Brazil sentenced 28 executives in and around former president Lula to prison for the corruption.All will be transferred to federal prisons starting on Wednesday, the judge said.It said the sentences will not run concurrently, meaning they start to run on July 14, when the cases will pass to federal prisons.The judge ruled that the remaining convicted executives must also be transferred to federal prisons, according to Brazil s public broadcaster Globo.Marcelo has also repeatedly claimed innocence.A Brazilian judge previously said evidence found in his computer system indicated that he ordered over 1 billion euros to foreign accounts to pay for a family villa outside Sao Paulo.The judge said Tuesday's decision was made \"after careful consideration of the evidence and the evidence to be obtained\", he said in a statement posted to the case s website.The judge also stressed in his statement that the verdict has not affected any ongoing criminal cases against other suspects.There are four current cases that are being tried.Two are involving officials from the federal security agency Pol\u00edcia Federal. The federal security agents have faced no legal issue over the payments.The other two cases are against former federal customs officials Luiz Carlos de Almeida Freitas and Gerson Pereira.","token_len":553,"entropy":[9.7093,2.3366,10.6966,0.6774,10.8386,3.1374,0.1265,0.0016,1.5063,2.488,5.8532,0.7665,2.9949,6.2766,10.4228,1.0533,3.6481,12.614,12.6775,3.5042,0.5762,0.5684,1.6368,2.9522,1.3949,2.1053,1.1738,2.3941,4.7207,4.6834,0.6915,4.8439,3.1414,1.9519,5.7879,4.5993,0.0718,2.4899,2.4337,0.0014,1.9094,5.8247,2.5477,0.6932,8.0765,0.9767,2.3561,1.3111,4.3094,1.3742,4.6311,0.1569,0.0009,3.3365,1.9935,1.7233,1.9249,2.6946,6.7138,0.8339,0.0095,7.487,0.2685,5.6195,5.1757,2.9732,0.0036,4.8073,6.365,5.9137,0.3882,0.0505,5.1331,2.6522,3.4138,3.6643,2.8435,2.3943,0.3321,1.5882,1.7125,0.6634,0.3765,0.2604,6.8547,4.4849,0.9604,4.954,1.6396,2.641,3.3876,0.3197,0.2027,2.4732,1.2123,2.4161,7.3683,3.2897,2.9162,1.5379,7.4976,3.4927,9.5258,3.9536,0.001,0.003,0.0003,3.9592,2.6205,2.3548,2.1916,0.0042,1.8766,2.3776,0.9401,0.0005,0.3335,1.1333,0.8784,5.6621,1.3103,3.3773,1.7993,1.3691,0.9484,2.5762,0.7185,6.6165,0.7414,2.856,0.2304,4.7686,1.1358,3.812,4.3622,0.0024,0.0004,1.9437,2.5571,5.4779,1.5731,1.3322,0.001,3.8036,0.5276,4.2928,0.2688,0.4219,0.147,0.6643,6.2767,3.2086,0.5292,4.2977,1.068,4.3086,0.4409,2.6794,4.3177,6.2219,4.8942,5.0795,0.6004,1.0368,2.6363,4.1077,1.0859,6.9678,0.9932,1.56,0.3364,2.3546,4.2565,8.3774,6.7071,1.5303,2.0014,0.0024,0.3795,0.0028,0.0024,0.0002,0.267,3.1988,2.995,2.3272,3.3584,0.9195,5.8826,2.3974,3.5314,0.0277,3.6173,0.7276,8.9871,0.0013,0.0008,8.247,3.7397,4.5419,5.5623,2.6597,3.9361,7.7793,1.6972,0.067,1.665,7.719,0.0243,2.3922,2.5299,1.8458,7.126,1.315,5.7824,0.0024,0.0071,3.03,7.2215,0.4019,0.7747,0.0064,0.0015,0.0003,1.0265,4.9703,0.9594,2.4358,1.5455,1.3833,10.6556,3.7799,7.2849,0.6529,0.6147,11.4146,0.5938,1.0421,10.5936,0.6724,1.0381,0.0398,5.2827,3.8572,0.0144,6.2712,3.7166,4.7374,1.5221,4.7434,1.7986,0.4221,2.8729,2.6143,4.6562,0.154,0.891,2.0668,6.9424,2.8708,8.8181,6.4558,0.4874,1.8248,2.0446,6.8706,1.2917,1.8397,0.0003,6.1658,1.2182,1.6895,1.9767,1.7223,5.2028,1.0181,1.4199,1.0968,2.4045,10.783,1.5664,1.8291,0.0051,0.0533,2.3216,0.0003,0.0004,0.0448,0.0001,0.0021,0.0002,0.344,5.9447,5.9488,6.5823,2.6083,3.7431,0.0015,0.847,2.0202,3.4423,6.8601,0.1568,1.6326,6.9307,0.8134,3.3298,4.6572,0.4548,4.2149,8.9409,6.5541,1.6342,3.2573,7.074,0.3323,6.4373,2.3284,3.3442,0.0003,1.2548,2.3984,1.0213,4.2344,2.8781,3.8518,6.3529,6.3014,0.6306,3.5996,0.2488,4.7799,1.1908,5.3243,0.9258,4.2478,1.2644,1.9739,1.1551,0.2049,0.4108,5.6055,5.3689,1.7888,3.2619,1.9191,2.5829,6.3018,1.0085,1.8261,3.0927,2.1584,8.3706,5.5086,2.144,4.15,5.4182,4.4266,1.6199,2.5326,1.2382,5.6761,1.8882,6.3552,1.7485,4.0598,3.8201,0.5855,1.8554,2.9794,4.437,0.6542,1.5249,5.7209,6.4419,0.273,3.7927,3.2101,1.127,1.3942,0.3136,1.2898,0.4344,2.0338,4.7554,0.0019,4.7195,2.7617,4.3992,2.4787,9.4456,0.0004,0.2766,5.4718,0.0014,0.0012,3.873,3.1222,6.4322,4.6445,3.7632,2.6031,4.6038,3.5069,2.371,6.1563,2.8525,6.8807,3.8448,0.7835,1.693,5.7035,3.2501,4.7565,0.8641,1.0666,4.5911,6.0768,3.0079,2.6183,1.5138,2.6375,6.9361,5.4237,2.9862,2.0987,1.9843,2.9932,7.1353,5.1272,0.0216,6.7473,2.1133,0.0401,1.3467,2.2487,1.812,1.215,6.1058,4.9287,3.0651,1.9725,3.9673,2.61,3.2024,2.0521,0.959,0.7968,0.766,1.532,1.7752,0.8803,2.5685,5.6138,2.0262,5.493,4.1395,5.081,0.3958,2.5037,0.341,0.5019,5.227,2.1783,1.3893,6.9293,7.0,1.7948,0.2539,1.918,1.7221,1.3272,5.9596,4.7795,0.6799,2.8351,0.1822,1.4474,5.329,4.4515,1.2803,2.3194,2.7579,4.6025,2.7259,2.2233,1.6738,3.9253,6.4291,1.0797,5.6194,1.438,4.3789,3.6593,4.5764,2.6945,1.886,2.42,3.3699,3.6459,5.0079,2.4131,4.6021,4.7096,1.9663,1.1802,5.0713,5.1983,1.5375,8.9228,2.6525,4.8207,4.2808,3.4024,1.944,5.3302,3.5831,5.8001,2.7733,6.4125,5.1369,4.1394,7.5753,3.9617,0.791,4.0849,1.4881,1.7213,1.2841,0.6367,2.0667,0.8398,3.9735,2.4451,3.577,8.0875,0.6907,7.3197,0.5648,4.8565,4.3585,3.5743,1.0493,0.0066,9.7079,0.6768,0.5575,5.6128,6.1832,5.9866,0.1546,1.6887]}

Support for","text":"Corsican nationalists said on Monday it was time for talks with Paris on greater autonomy for the French Mediterranean island, after they won nearly two thirds of seats in local elections. Support for autonomy grew from a little over a quarter at the last local election in 2011 to more than one third today. It is unclear if the main rival, the National Front, would agree to a referendum, as suggested by president Hollande. The President said there was \u201c no plan \u201d with the National Front regarding autonomy, but added that he did not want Corsicans to see the island only as a tourist destination. \u201cIf you think only Corsica needs to be a tourist destination, you know that you are mistaken. I think there should be more Corsican content there. \u201c \u201cWe can agree to talk, but from the beginning we have said we want full autonomy of Corsica,\u201d said nationalist leader Jean-Guy Talamoni, who won 63 seats. The government last year proposed opening a dialogue but nationalist leaders rejected it. Talamoni said there should be no discussion except for how Corsicans can vote on the question of independence. In Corsica, the nationalist movement has been on the rise and many of the votes won by this group were not only due to nationalists. In addition, the Christian Socialist party, the party\u2019s ally in the Corsican parliament, had its best result in local elections and was able to defeat the National Front for the third time. Hollande has not announced his preference for a referendum. \u201cIf this is not the case, we should discuss the matter by opening a forum for dialogue, in which there is a dialogue on issues,\u201d Talamoni said. The Corsican nationalist leaders also suggested that \u201cit would be wiser to work together on the creation of an autonomous region\u201d in addition to autonomy but did not provide any more details. On Monday, Talamoni had a meeting with President Hollande in Paris and met also with Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy. For the first time since 1998, no National Front member has won a seat on Corsica\u2019s parliament, where the movement is dominant. The Corsican nationalist leaders told their opponents there could be a fight for the local elections of 2017, but no conflict. For Corsican nationalists, it is of great importance to have their voice heard in the French government and at other decision-making bodies and are pushing for increased decentralization. Talamoni said that when it comes to the independence question, it is Corsicans who know \u201cwhat they want\u201d and added that \u201cif it was up to the French government,\u201d then Corsica would be independent by now.","token_len":554,"entropy":[7.8938,4.841,10.428,5.7215,3.6114,2.474,3.936,0.7667,2.2535,0.8127,8.0558,2.472,6.9766,3.7162,9.2838,4.1877,0.6653,1.6106,3.1488,10.9777,2.6363,2.6222,3.6894,4.8397,5.0407,6.1514,2.7045,2.476,0.0237,4.1296,0.3269,4.6211,0.4334,1.2255,11.4641,0.207,4.3569,4.5181,3.324,3.3935,6.387,0.5566,2.7956,1.4517,4.8774,0.7578,3.1572,2.3191,0.5764,1.1867,3.5692,2.1828,1.4702,0.0044,3.7615,2.6612,2.8483,0.3896,5.2552,1.4308,3.0948,2.53,1.2148,4.8803,4.7056,1.5027,1.2414,3.065,0.0071,0.4359,3.3926,2.6199,0.2319,2.2344,2.2948,2.5222,3.226,6.091,0.16,8.7618,5.099,0.9444,2.5379,7.5027,2.9916,4.2393,1.0215,17.2846,8.0832,5.8196,4.3681,1.2739,7.1799,5.1934,1.1395,1.42,0.0169,7.6862,2.5834,1.7835,1.4308,3.7549,0.6441,1.7542,2.8437,0.1337,1.479,11.7524,2.628,0.4649,4.5769,1.8208,2.847,8.0376,0.5823,0.4087,4.1585,0.3682,0.5439,4.9184,0.4261,7.1981,2.2903,3.9514,7.3945,1.9534,3.4337,4.5984,1.2924,0.8352,1.9883,0.2554,0.112,0.5152,1.7273,4.676,1.6555,2.7176,1.9479,4.2901,1.0519,3.3865,2.2917,2.9725,2.6162,0.0506,3.3465,5.7785,0.8066,7.272,4.9889,0.9952,2.1535,0.1685,4.7096,0.1505,5.5155,3.0706,5.588,1.2022,4.8089,3.1359,0.9066,6.4974,1.8675,2.8992,1.0252,1.9837,4.5777,1.6878,1.1628,5.9528,0.3086,2.5935,0.9347,0.3108,1.731,8.4625,4.3426,4.4956,8.3682,1.3105,2.7459,0.1557,6.2688,7.9231,4.4615,6.8323,1.5208,1.2061,2.8816,5.344,3.9781,2.0999,2.8354,5.2315,6.1944,1.5192,3.6573,6.6801,1.8014,6.3237,5.4019,11.2266,1.6607,3.4815,1.3148,0.7658,4.5253,0.0051,0.0008,1.2324,3.2706,2.259,0.1245,2.0712,3.8011,6.9155,1.9972,6.5111,1.117,1.0136,2.6483,3.0403,2.658,1.7288,2.8811,0.4713,1.8374,0.4178,4.155,7.1603,1.0104,0.2794,1.7866,4.9087,3.139,1.6996,1.8322,3.8719,0.9813,1.3084,3.9401,4.1915,2.6232,1.2865,5.1817,5.1497,1.0464,5.7368,1.4119,2.0389,3.3196,5.6581,5.5706,0.0262,7.3345,3.8198,2.9034,4.2045,0.6324,1.5172,7.7791,4.2505,1.9757,1.8172,2.1365,3.1025,13.2326,6.4071,3.9249,6.7294,0.7404,0.6618,5.7238,0.0611,2.091,0.19,3.864,3.7097,4.7935,2.6762,1.1288,3.5794,0.0685,5.0484,2.6088,2.877,0.0092,4.784,0.8009,1.6193,0.137,4.7966,0.9038,2.5188,0.2156,1.5939,7.1177,2.538,3.9745,3.8784,1.7327,4.8864,0.2577,1.7667,0.2504,1.7143,4.4891,0.3223,5.3697,3.7795,1.2065,1.8418,1.7557,0.9181,0.2826,1.9404,3.1355,3.6272,2.3011,2.5415,5.9681,6.3827,1.005,5.6706,2.727,1.3168,1.7285,5.512,1.0566,3.8024,1.7229,1.4787,3.475,2.1715,4.0304,3.1113,1.7752,1.0033,2.6205,0.0047,0.0006,0.348,0.1523,2.0364,5.8596,0.0769,3.2179,3.7637,2.5861,4.7346,0.8278,10.4571,0.3413,3.6428,1.9715,0.1406,6.7919,0.7226,5.4148,1.6831,2.2685,1.8222,5.5114,0.0539,2.1185,2.1242,2.316,1.6877,0.7037,3.151,5.2826,0.006,4.4839,7.1706,3.1166,0.0122,3.0729,1.253,4.4723,0.3342,0.4124,4.8486,1.0091,0.2734,3.9968,0.0078,0.0007,5.3269,3.2906,2.517,0.1406,3.6069,0.7986,2.4063,2.1196,2.2205,5.4639,8.1206,0.7425,4.4256,0.027,0.7064,0.0122,0.0021,0.0007,0.0,1.6147,3.4665,0.1234,5.0634,0.6784,0.0004,5.2487,6.4059,1.3342,1.0311,0.0132,1.7699,6.3589,0.162,5.2705,5.353,0.0362,3.4469,1.1296,1.9245,1.464,1.3339,2.9517,5.0806,1.2394,4.9587,1.9645,1.8566,1.4358,2.1514,5.0063,1.5596,6.8641,1.5034,5.3561,0.2518,1.776,4.7996,0.0565,1.5286,1.5027,4.9174,4.4108,4.6511,4.8836,3.4648,0.1388,1.4319,6.8028,1.7648,1.8177,6.0892,1.4543,5.1723,2.9769,1.6816,1.9992,4.5771,6.6156,2.8061,5.2466,3.8409,0.5868,0.4561,0.2922,2.8809,1.1214,7.1544,2.9753,0.5579,0.9828,2.5347,3.8681,3.161,0.1472,1.784,0.9878,4.9563,3.9764,2.1002,4.8544,5.6532,7.4337,0.1723,0.0734,0.5789,3.9777,6.7031,6.2186,0.6119,5.6125,6.8664,0.6634,1.2292,4.712,0.0061,0.0007,0.689,1.6205,4.9429,2.6244,0.207,0.016,1.4719,3.8565,2.3305,0.3138,2.6724,0.6459,6.7092,1.9476,0.4765,6.321,8.6565,0.3611,3.6899,1.7393,0.7368,1.0916,0.671,1.3984,7.3756,0.1511,6.7667,0.0978,2.8101,2.6852,3.2738,2.5759,0.0309,1.933,4.0933,1.3996,0.676,4.5036,0.2914,4.7165,2.2659,2.8805,1.0827,0.8088,3.996,4.4935,3.469,0.1927]}
{"prompt":"The White House said on Thursday it believed that Saudi Arabia would allow a blocked port in Yemen to open after President Donald Trump urged Riyadh to lift a blockade to let humanitarian aid reach","text":"The White House said on Thursday it believed that Saudi Arabia would allow a blocked port in Yemen to open after President Donald Trump urged Riyadh to lift a blockade to let humanitarian aid reach Yemeni civilians.\nUS State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said the administration made the request after speaking with its Arab allies who \u201cdemanded action.\u201d\n\u201cThe most basic thing they told us is that they understand that there is a humanitarian crisis here in Yemen. And I don\u2019t like to say that \u2026 it\u2019s terrible, but it\u2019s not unprecedented and not unique to Yemen,\u201d she said.\nUnder pressure, Saudi Arabia and its regional coalition have eased a blockade that has starved millions of Yemeni civilians, including at least 1.3 million children.\nIn recent days, it has allowed two US-led aid ships with enough fuel and supplies for more than a thousand people to enter the area where an armed Huthi rebel group is fighting government forces and militias.\nNauert said that with those shipments, she saw \u201csigns\u201d of a possible opening in a blockade.\n\u201cSo I made certain representations to the US allies there to demand that they take action.\u201d\nShe said Washington \u201cwas encouraged by how well our partners understood\u201d an attack on the Saudi oil facilities.\n\u201cThey also understand that this is not a war between the United States and Saudi Arabia,\u201d Nauert said. \u201cThe United States is not involved. These are issues of regional governance here.\u201d\nThe US State Department later said that both the Saudis and the rebels had \u201curgent\u201d conversations regarding the possible opening of the port.\nUS military strikes in September and December killed dozens of Yemen\u2019s Houthi militias that were allies with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.\nPresident Trump said on Wednesday that he asked the Saudis to open the port.\nThe announcement by Trump sparked outrage among some who say it undermines Trump\u2019s calls to strengthen ties with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.\nAccording to the International Committee of the Red Cross, there have been an alarming number of disappearances and deaths in the Yemen conflict.

At the same time, they see a key element of their campaign through to victory: an international court to try Syrian war crimes.\nIn spite of the Syrian government s brutal repression that has spilled more than 100,000 victims since 2011, Assad has retained a significant international public sphere. This public has proved to be a boon for those Assad loyalists, like the United States and Russia, who want to make the transition in Damascus a successful one. For the other countries of the region, including Qatar, Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia, Assad remains the symbol of repression and oppression and a source of continued instability. For those outside the region, Assad represents a legacy of violence and bloodshed that will remain for generations to come.\nSyria s fate will be decided in the years ahead at a series of meetings. For Russia, it is an effort to win over support for a peaceful transition in Syria so as to avoid a more difficult confrontation. For the United States it is an effort to persuade world leaders that Assad must go. In any event, Assad s demise, whether by force or through a peaceful transition, will usher in an unprecedented period of change in Syria; we will have to wait and see how it turns out.\nRussia has sought a peaceful transition in Syria since the beginning of the revolution. At the same time, it has made it clear that if Assad is unable or unwilling to go, the only choice for the Syrian regime is military defeat.\nFor the United States, the current situation in Syria represents a test of whether the two powers are willing to accept the inevitable: Assad will go. Will Russia cooperate with the UN for a peaceful transition? Will the United States stop making statements that give Assad time to keep killing his people? In the end, Assad s fate will depend on the wills of those around the world who are in a position to influence the decisions of the Syrians.

In the end, Assad s fate will depend on the wills of those around the world who are in a position to influence the decisions of the Syrians.","token_len":555,"entropy":[2.3156,8.5923,2.3978,5.5964,7.7837,8.2739,9.7964,5.2331,0.4132,3.0666,7.8557,1.0076,0.2529,0.2289,0.0027,6.2218,5.5214,0.7151,4.6356,6.8963,2.2502,5.878,0.5023,8.5128,7.6688,4.8255,1.4852,2.0702,9.488,2.4979,8.3097,0.1403,0.8452,6.8699,2.8935,2.7201,6.8848,0.0265,2.8447,4.8603,1.7172,5.347,0.6199,0.1506,0.0043,0.1875,1.5915,3.5027,2.0811,5.6822,4.1239,1.1641,2.2522,5.8613,6.5176,5.8263,3.4509,2.126,3.3883,3.6031,6.3182,2.831,5.324,3.0625,5.0726,0.7579,0.9373,0.8378,10.7367,6.2604,0.0098,1.2414,5.0009,1.8915,4.055,6.8222,2.874,4.3457,1.09,7.55,7.6531,0.3437,3.7756,0.4183,0.0039,5.4481,3.7723,2.8533,0.3276,5.2907,2.1346,5.2857,1.944,4.1358,4.0663,6.5867,5.4496,1.1381,3.8016,3.5771,7.0617,6.6699,1.8984,0.0966,1.7884,5.5937,0.819,5.2446,7.1367,3.9311,0.259,3.2762,5.0651,1.9086,3.9476,0.4572,1.28,2.2054,0.4496,0.2069,3.4117,0.4151,4.2229,2.3524,4.7542,4.1817,3.6705,2.4885,4.453,0.248,0.2996,4.6634,1.959,5.4833,3.3294,3.6805,0.2787,1.0419,0.4699,3.4842,4.761,0.7195,2.2708,0.6437,3.2937,0.7307,1.4962,0.0012,0.0934,3.3322,4.8005,1.8935,5.5426,0.0474,9.0088,1.2667,4.8292,3.4636,1.858,4.0714,0.0124,7.5041,2.8894,0.7011,4.4772,3.5845,4.0591,0.9357,1.1751,0.3657,2.3552,3.345,0.9876,6.8066,0.1463,4.3591,0.8122,4.0829,1.4607,3.3318,3.6547,2.8678,2.3205,0.4978,0.0032,0.1204,0.409,3.5638,2.2802,5.9185,3.0244,1.22,1.0567,1.4975,1.2266,4.6431,0.9712,6.216,1.3999,6.5798,0.0023,2.3794,4.3068,3.9808,5.08,0.6913,2.8401,1.2135,2.9781,5.792,0.1836,4.753,2.5671,3.9547,1.4391,1.7488,4.1379,1.0194,2.3253,0.9202,5.5663,2.2838,0.0919,2.8732,1.774,4.5933,4.4962,3.4747,1.7629,0.744,1.0964,0.7205,0.0224,4.2218,0.1473,1.2432,0.485,0.0445,3.7578,6.2312,1.0694,1.3952,2.0666,2.8113,2.8408,0.8508,3.9755,4.0884,1.3076,0.0245,3.3725,1.7684,5.1428,4.2008,3.9497,2.8985,2.4778,0.1028,1.7526,2.6279,2.968,1.9046,0.2612,0.8189,5.9577,0.0992,2.2245,3.4934,1.7142,0.1406,3.4421,0.936,1.1713,6.4344,5.9248,1.9948,2.6157,1.3303,1.074,0.9702,0.022,1.5938,1.8933,3.2316,0.0086,0.2203,0.5691,4.7673,2.5303,5.1988,2.5592,2.6306,1.6386,1.707,0.2206,1.7224,1.3696,1.5774,0.2211,0.198,4.5226,1.6871,4.4382,0.6196,1.0641,0.0019,0.1277,1.2629,0.4488,4.0946,2.8155,0.1837,0.2374,4.2017,1.3828,1.8719,4.2776,4.1732,0.0288,0.0454,3.6135,0.3843,1.9627,4.0841,4.1677,2.242,1.5396,1.7298,3.1621,0.5258,5.1923,4.1461,0.5531,2.342,3.2185,1.4735,0.5502,0.0204,0.3763,1.3958,4.9252,2.216,1.5551,0.1406,3.2866,0.6099,5.4819,0.5774,3.5203,1.5546,5.3109,2.861,3.0149,1.1235,0.047,3.2352,1.2413,4.6889,4.8745,3.204,2.4327,2.4767,1.5922,6.8716,1.8897,6.9757,0.8407,0.8873,6.2225,5.9973,1.3577,1.051,0.6213,1.4087,0.777,1.7023,0.5819,0.0328,5.9492,5.1303,5.3379,1.769,5.6159,2.9116,5.2307,0.0527,7.3794,6.3841,2.4785,2.5057,0.8224,4.2841,1.7189,1.3346,0.0718,3.2316,2.0527,0.5778,0.4125,2.7495,0.241,1.4156,11.0328,0.0998,2.9423,3.6546,3.618,0.2649,1.0697,2.3311,4.3184,2.8618,0.4402,0.0441,3.0581,0.9249,4.678,0.4152,0.6294,6.0477,1.2327,4.7627,2.0116,3.9021,0.7556,0.0552,0.0821,0.1675,0.0058,0.0336,0.0165,0.0248,0.0008,0.0014,0.0039,0.0611,0.0616,0.0042,0.0017,0.0016,0.0003,0.0021,0.0015,0.0011,0.0013,0.001,0.001,0.0005,0.0109,0.0786,0.0109,0.0011,0.0037,0.0004,0.0012,0.0004,0.0018,0.0029,0.0531,0.0008,0.001,0.0126,0.0083,0.0075,0.0044,0.016,0.0043,3.8598,1.1567,0.2274,0.0032,0.1116,0.0802,0.1279,0.0018,0.0044,0.0027,0.0009,0.0077,0.0022,0.0008,0.0052,0.0017,0.0007,0.0253,0.0066,0.0038,0.0027,0.0061,0.0035,0.0094,0.0168,0.3565,0.0251,0.0151,0.0026,0.2857,0.0494,0.0625,0.002,0.0018,0.027,0.0015,0.0018,0.0068,0.0046,0.0196,0.0285,0.0017,0.0184,0.0022,0.001,0.002,0.0005,0.0015,0.0021,0.0108,0.0032,0.0018,0.0031,0.0014,0.003,0.003,0.007,0.1577,0.0018,0.0043,0.0004,0.0872,0.4578,0.0029,0.006,0.0022,0.0038,0.0054,0.0422,0.0007,0.0049,0.0028,0.001,0.0095,0.0012,0.0045,0.0024,0.0021,0.0004,0.0008,0.0003,0.0014,0.0008,0.0008,0.0014,0.0062,0.002]}

Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on Sunday said he thinks the House bill could \u201c work in some areas, but I think there can be some problems.\u201dFormer Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday the healthcare bill needs to be changed before it can pass any \u201c serious \u201d scrutiny.Some members of Congress from both sides of the aisle told Politico they may consider passing the House bill even if it fails to meet Trump \u2019 s original goals.\u201c There are elements of the House bill \u2014 such as funding for prescription drugs, the ability of patients to opt out of certain kinds of coverage \u2014 that we\u2019d like to see done by legislation, and that\u2019s a matter of Congress\u2019 ability to move quickly,\u201d Rep. Bill Pasqualino, a Democrat from Tennessee, said.\u201c And there is another group of Republicans and Democrats who may well find it possible to pass a bill if it\u2019s amended in the form that it was passed by the House.\u201dRepublicans are also skeptical of an unfinished bill, which would be their preferred approach, although many Republicans do want to see the health reform bill passed.Rep. Tom Graves, the lead Republican on immigration in the House, called on his fellow House members to support the bill as it stands.\u201c It looks to me that any significant change in the House bill could mean repeal at some point in the future,\u201d Graves, a Texas Republican, said in a congressional hearing on the bill.\u201c I am not sure when or, worse, if the bill will change at all.\u201d(Updates with new data )","token_len":555,"entropy":[6.7193,0.0882,0.0354,0.0301,2.6298,4.225,0.0127,5.1231,2.7575,2.1138,1.4259,4.9556,1.4433,5.7034,3.8756,0.0283,2.6374,4.5704,7.9637,0.0579,1.2996,1.6543,1.2856,8.3178,1.5527,0.1169,1.1207,6.4752,2.2998,15.2118,8.6999,8.9376,6.3294,0.5334,1.8086,4.1619,5.8953,0.3725,4.625,0.1907,5.5549,1.6067,1.0842,2.8425,13.5756,5.0553,11.2136,4.6808,5.8493,5.2531,0.8227,0.6317,1.8951,4.7889,3.3398,1.3353,6.0935,5.7245,2.502,7.6301,0.1375,9.2928,3.3727,0.0035,2.0243,0.006,0.3764,3.4382,0.0468,0.1286,0.0106,0.2756,5.0299,0.8747,1.9829,1.3901,9.6587,3.9281,0.684,5.8275,2.4739,5.6373,1.511,1.3634,1.0925,1.9638,3.6639,7.5711,0.4407,7.7295,1.0641,0.6578,1.4046,2.3443,1.5544,5.3266,6.9131,9.3973,5.6162,5.0682,7.5852,4.2199,2.5619,1.2642,14.8135,2.9414,6.3533,0.434,1.0917,0.4173,5.4613,0.0784,0.5687,3.5261,1.9184,4.7773,2.996,2.9438,0.9196,1.1685,1.2261,5.7909,0.1344,7.0584,1.9296,6.3081,2.594,1.7962,3.175,4.1694,1.1763,2.5729,1.0696,3.1022,0.4277,0.139,1.3087,4.7134,7.1547,4.7837,1.0553,3.7403,3.0357,4.9349,1.0873,0.2967,3.3153,2.5025,5.0689,0.8981,6.7052,4.3751,4.195,4.3831,1.1793,0.9571,0.5726,2.0564,5.0562,0.3688,0.3031,0.784,1.7887,0.7335,1.4031,2.1335,4.6376,2.4931,0.0004,1.9435,1.594,5.7986,0.0701,1.9379,3.3064,0.5289,2.5802,1.3723,3.397,5.5669,1.1866,0.667,5.7344,3.7341,3.9686,1.8122,4.8045,1.4224,5.2201,1.4058,5.1603,1.7999,5.8519,1.1571,4.4186,1.8853,6.6975,3.3688,1.8025,0.4522,2.099,3.0311,4.9148,2.6767,3.6591,11.1603,2.1404,5.5431,4.161,1.8363,1.5615,1.4281,3.7495,3.4627,2.5317,10.8789,0.4006,0.3677,5.4462,0.1996,4.1115,0.0582,1.5356,0.4241,0.0021,0.0959,0.0252,0.0129,4.1363,0.7644,1.1818,0.7354,5.1148,0.7513,1.3226,0.3394,2.9373,8.1385,0.6102,5.8554,3.3942,4.2735,3.3136,1.2677,0.7616,6.1464,2.0981,2.7712,5.0625,0.2475,1.4329,3.1366,1.9564,0.7599,2.629,6.6685,4.3011,0.0038,0.1364,2.9402,0.0291,1.8125,4.3481,3.5566,4.9335,0.3547,4.7764,0.3969,0.2746,2.8121,3.9745,0.6075,0.9863,1.9909,6.0631,9.3985,0.8975,7.2108,4.7931,1.5244,3.8546,0.764,6.2704,4.02,0.2438,1.0632,5.781,0.7977,2.7538,0.2153,0.0501,0.0126,5.1134,0.8541,1.8665,5.4443,4.264,4.1843,0.968,1.863,0.2998,4.4238,0.7983,0.6225,3.5847,0.3744,4.605,4.6742,2.4226,0.1893,0.0572,4.7679,3.122,0.7468,1.624,0.7604,6.1488,1.1622,8.8169,0.5722,0.8108,1.2291,0.1701,5.0133,2.7455,0.0034,4.9118,1.045,6.1595,0.5487,1.6525,3.9859,4.7793,5.189,5.2428,0.1308,2.2189,0.2016,0.1175,2.7626,4.2996,0.0034,2.2222,1.5995,0.1982,5.293,8.5226,6.4979,4.583,1.9267,0.6108,0.1513,5.1399,4.738,6.4562,2.0836,3.4955,2.2237,3.9781,3.9489,0.1657,2.1629,5.1611,0.9434,5.6366,2.0244,0.6978,7.1788,0.1332,3.6697,2.4637,2.6564,4.9868,1.4227,5.2297,0.0289,3.959,14.8305,2.6663,2.2924,0.5017,3.6722,3.3657,0.3467,4.9969,0.2746,1.1417,1.7127,1.2862,0.849,5.4144,2.108,1.7344,4.4019,5.0208,0.5668,2.2124,4.6684,1.0636,0.9256,3.4787,6.2992,4.8426,1.1888,7.2053,0.2989,1.1756,1.9529,0.9966,3.6349,0.9469,3.9421,0.6471,0.1476,3.857,3.336,1.3187,6.7163,3.809,2.5239,2.3466,4.6382,1.7083,0.6036,0.7146,1.2523,1.1043,1.7327,5.1831,2.1831,2.6522,4.5807,1.0084,4.6036,9.879,1.4792,2.0426,2.6646,1.7624,3.6708,6.6987,3.0824,3.3267,2.0338,5.7133,3.8403,2.1622,4.311,3.5574,0.4828,1.3632,1.6156,3.6748,4.0761,0.9089,3.4585,1.1668,3.7466,0.0697,2.9897,5.3351,0.3738,4.0188,4.8977,2.3666,0.2499,8.5546,3.6636,0.2408,0.2785,0.4634,4.3003,1.8595,3.229,2.6448,2.864,1.1798,0.2709,2.6563,0.5505,1.9048,3.4194,1.049,2.0821,0.7614,0.9006,0.9721,5.1542,5.5543,3.4286,0.3827,1.345,5.3938,5.5586,1.9087,0.8201,0.6703,2.0068,0.207,2.1171,4.02,6.4357,5.5263,0.6523,0.0615,2.4487,0.3122,0.3759,1.08,0.4609,0.8314,0.9469,4.6836,1.3169,4.9429,0.3518,0.3705,0.8574,2.0525,0.6889,7.8937,2.3625,1.2666,2.5525,1.8633,1.2264,1.3452,0.779,4.0724,3.0347,1.6191,1.3752,4.4337,3.2144,7.007,9.912,0.4085,0.9245,1.613,1.8891,0.7047,5.0502,3.5282,0.0705,0.738,0.7503,0.9428,6.3943,7.8022,0.0827,1.749,3.6134,4.9745,6.4443]}
{"prompt":"Argentina has given up on rescuing 44 crew members on a submarine that disappeared 15 days ago , though it will continue the search for the vessel with international assistance , a navy spokesman said","text":"Argentina has given up on rescuing 44 crew members on a submarine that disappeared 15 days ago, though it will continue the search for the vessel with international assistance, a navy spokesman said on Wednesday.\nThe navy could have been better prepared, the official said in response to questions about why it was too late to take the ill-prepared vessel out of the water, when he was told earlier that a search would be conducted.\nA spokesman for the International Search and Rescue Agency said that his agency would remain onboard until all crew members had been rescued. However, he stopped short of saying if the search was completed.\nThe navy says it has lost communication with the submarine, which had been towed in to port in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, after it went missing 15 days ago.\nThe crew were travelling from the north east of Argentina to the Falkland Islands. They are all Argentine nationals and some came to the Falklands in a bid to escape economic difficulties in Argentina, a source who is involved in their rescue operation told Reuters.\nThe crew's boat broke down and they were stranded, the source said and asked for anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the press.\nSeveral other sources who are also part of the operation have confirmed that the entire crew has been given up for lost.\nIt is thought that the crew did not have the proper qualifications to enter the water in freezing conditions.\nThe navy in the Argentinian city of Rosarito, which is not far from where the boat broke down, has opened two new areas for searching the ocean in the waters where the submarine is believed to be, a navy spokesman said, and has started using sonar to detect the missing vessel.\nThe navy launched the ocean search for the submarine after receiving a distress call on June 17 from a local man who said he and his friend had been wandering for a week in a heavy fog when they discovered a ship with its black hull bobbing up and down in the ocean.\nInitial reports had revealed that a member of the public had spotted what looked like a submarine's lights heading toward Rosarito on Tuesday.\nThe navy did not report earlier that the crew, who belong to a Buenos Aires shipyard, went into a breakdown during a journey to the Argentinian port of Ushuaia.\nIt was only when the news of the search came that the navy realised the search had begun.\nThe Argentinian government is expected to soon announce an emergency relief

Iraq s semi-autonomous","text":"Kurdish protesters, angered by years of austerity and unpaid public sector salaries, set fire to the offices of political parties near the city of Sulaimaniyah on Monday, demanding that Iraq s semi-autonomous Kurdistan be more closely integrated with the rest of the country.\nProtesters also set fire to the offices of the state-run Kurdistan Investment Fund and the Kurdistan Workers Party s political headquarters in Baghdad, as well as a Kurdish-owned TV station in Sulaniyah that was broadcasting the protests.\nA major security force was called in to guard the offices and in the capital city of Baghdad, there were tense scenes outside a number of parliament buildings late Monday evening that were being guarded by the National Guard and military observers who reported hearing gunshots.\nThe clashes are being reported as taking place just days before the start of an Iraq s parliament election in which the Kurdish National Congress, Kurdistan s ruling party, is being seen as having a good chance to win representation in parliament.\nThe clashes also come at a time of a growing dissatisfaction across the Iraqi population at years of hardship and anger with political corruption.\nThe Kurdistan Region government launched a public consultation on Monday to seek feedback on a plan aimed at ensuring its political autonomy and economic development, the state-run Kurdistan News Agency reported.\nThe government is calling for a two-stage public consultation which is open until May 13, allowing locals to express their opinions on the draft law and propose amendments prior to its submission to parliament.\nUnder the proposal, elected parliamentarians would be prohibited from leaving the Kurdistan Region while parliament has no authority over the public service, and the proposal does not include provisions that would require elected parliamentarians to represent the regional interests.\nThe proposed law must then be ratified by the Kurdistan Region parliament before a government is formed.\nAs well as the Kurdistan Region parliamentarian, the proposed law would also include the Kurdistan Council, a body of political activists, which would be given authority over public service and education, along with the executive.\nA coalition of parliamentarians and parties is aiming to force the federal government to give Kurdish political and business leadership significant influence in the Kurdistan Region and to guarantee Kurdish autonomy and national pride, the BBC reported.\nIraqis have been holding anti-government protests in many Iraqi cities for several weeks now over mounting inflation and unemployment.\nThe protests are set to run into August and concern groups fear they are likely to

{"prompt":"South Korea and the United States launched large-scale joint aerial drills on Monday , officials said , a week after North Korea said it had tested its most advanced missile as part of a weapons","text":"South Korea and the United States launched large-scale joint aerial drills on Monday, officials said, a week after North Korea said it had tested its most advanced missile as part of a weapons program aimed at striking Washington and Seoul.\nThe drills, which commenced on Monday to test a newly developed North Korean missile that the Seoul military says it is capable of reaching Japan, are a dramatic escalation of tensions in the volatile peninsula since the North claimed last year to have succeeded in developing a missile capable of hitting the USA, and has tested it many times.\nThe joint drills, the first such involving the USA since President Trump signed a bill last month imposing heavier sanctions on North Korea\u2019s economy, will involve about 60 military aircraft and five warships.\nIn a statement at the start of the joint drills, South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said two North Korean F-15K fighter jets flew over the South on Monday and \u201cparticipated in a friendly air defence exercise in a specific part\u201d of South East air defense, where North Korean jets regularly fly.\nAt the end of that exercise, the two fighter jets joined the American and South Korean F-15K jets for a joint drill, it said.\nIn the statement, the defence ministry added: \u201cThe American and South Korean militaries have recently joined the South\u2019s joint deterrent capabilities of the air force, and we are expanding the scope to include both the navy and the air force.\u201d\nThe North Korean missile has been described as an Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) by Pyongyang and it is thought to have been tested last Tuesday. The South\u2019s defence ministry said the missile was capable of reaching Japan and it was in the range of the defence missiles the South has at its Pukchang military air base.\nAccording to a defence ministry statement the missile was \u201cabout 2,000 km from Pukchang\u201d and was carried on a rocket with the payload of an Improved Scud missile, a medium-range ballistic missile.\nIn order to further verify the missile and to confirm the launch site, the ministry said it will test missiles in the area the missile was spotted and continue launching maneuver training.\nWhile the missile was travelling in the atmosphere \u2013 the ministry added the missile went by the designated trajectory and the flight of the ballistic missile was in the designated range, not exceeding the

{"prompt":"Brexit minister David Davis said Britain had taken a big step forward in delivering the country s departure from the European Union on Friday , commenting on a deal with the EU Commission to move","text":"Brexit minister David Davis said Britain had taken a big step forward in delivering the country s departure from the European Union on Friday, commenting on a deal with the EU Commission to move forward with an exit plan.\nAt a time of mounting anxiety about the Brexit crisis in the UK, Davis said the EU had made a commitment to hold talks that would try to find a way for the UK and EU to be on a common footing after Britain leaves the EU. It is a major step as the UK is preparing to leave the EU on Apr. 29,\u201d the Brexit minister said.\nDavis said that the Brexit plan, which came out of talks between Britain and the EU at the weekend, was in keeping with the Conservative Party\u2019s commitment to leave the EU on the date it has put forward.\nThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t big concerns, but if you have a lot of faith in the system and it\u2019s being handled appropriately, then you don\u2019t worry, and you just move on with your life,\u201d Davis said.\nHe also said that he hoped that any concerns the EU has with the plan had come about as a result of \u201cpolitical decisions made in different countries.\u201d\nBrexit minister David Davis leaves after speaking to journalists outside Downing Street, London, Britain on May 03, 2016.\nDavis later confirmed to BBC television that he plans to resign in the coming days and that Theresa May will propose his replacement to the prime minister.\nI\u2019m just going to assume that Theresa May wants something in my shoes,\u201d he told BBC radio. \u201cAnd as I said before the weekend, I don\u2019t think I have it in me to take this job.\u201d\nAs the Brexit talks progressed toward a final settlement, David Davis, then a top cabinet minister, had said that Britain would leave the EU by the end of 2020.\nAfter years of bitter, costly negotiations, and a general election last year, this may be the best position for Britain to be in at this time,\u201d he said on Friday.\nDavis said that the EU did not have a problem with the deal in general, which would see the UK maintain a free trade arrangement until the end of the transition period after leaving the EU in three years, though several EU countries had concerns about the level of free

{"prompt":"The government of Niger has approved the use of armed American drones , a U.S. official said on Thursday , expanding the U.S. ability to target militants in the region . Reuters had already reported","text":"The government of Niger has approved the use of armed American drones, a U.S. official said on Thursday, expanding the U.S. ability to target militants in the region. Reuters had already reported on September 26th that the U.S. has approved such operations against militants in Niger. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland spoke to reporters on Thursday. [ \u2026 ]\nBrett McGurk told a Washington Post news conference the drone program was in response to what the intelligence community had reported as increased attacks against American personnel in Africa. [ \u2026 ]\nOn November 8, 2005 (the Tuesday), a coalition of more than 60 non-governmental organizations, including the Human Rights Watch, issued a statement on behalf of all human rights activists in the Middle East and North Africa. This statement had been delivered by the Coalition of African, Arab and Islamic Groups (COAJAG) in New York. The coalition called for the abolition of the Special War Powers Act that has allowed US involvement across the world since the cold winter of 1973-74. According to the letter, they have been a major impediment to effective human rights monitoring in the Middle East and North Africa and to an international intervention in the region. The Special War Powers Act was passed by the US Congress in 1947. It has been extended periodically since it was introduced the first time. The current version was signed by President Bush in 1993. The main objective of the Act is to grant the military the power to conduct covert operations to achieve military objectives beyond the borders of the US, and to do battle against perceived threats. According to the letter, the military can carry out activities, which would not otherwise be permitted under traditional laws and regulations, without adequate legal oversight. It was pointed out in the letter that human rights violation had become increasingly common, and that US military actions against terrorism had gone out of control, leading to human rights violations. They pointed out that the laws had led to the US military involvement in the conflicts in Liberia, Haiti, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, and that many human rights violations had been committed in these conflicts. (Mehdi Jafar, The Guardian, October 31, 2005)\nDr. Jihad Ahmad Al Durrah, a member of the Palestinian Hamas governing body, has been charged with inciting against his country. He was sentenced to three years in prison in the first trial under the International Criminal Court for peace crimes. The crimes Al Durrah alleged he had committed were committing Palestinian citizens to suicide bombers.

{"prompt":"Iran will treat a British-Iranian aid worker as an Iranian citizen and she will serve her sentence as determined by the judiciary , Iran s foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday . British Foreign Secretary","text":"Iran will treat a British-Iranian aid worker as an Iranian citizen and she will serve her sentence as determined by the judiciary, Iran s foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the action against the woman, named only as Ms. Narguiba, was unacceptable, according to the United Nations News Service. The Iranian ministry statement said British parliamentarians had raised Narguiba's case with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, to which he answered on Monday by noting that Britain would be the only country that would impose a sentence on an Iranian woman for being a British national. Iranian officials have repeatedly denied that the woman, 31 years old, was born in Iran and she has said she had studied in the United Kingdom. She had been working for the UN World Food Programme in Iran while serving a sentence of 11 years for helping British intelligence in espionage cases in Iran. In Iran, women are only permitted to seek certain degrees of education and jobs which do not require being seen in public. British authorities allege that Ms. Narguiba, a school teacher who once served as chief of women's issues within the conservative Iranian intelligence service, had been working as a spy for Britain's secret services. She is now wanted by British and Iranian police. Narguiba was arrested in a shopping mall in Tehran's bazaar of Miran in March 2004 and has been in jail ever since. In May, she was sentenced 11 years in prison and sentenced to an additional one year of probation. Her case came to light after a visit to Iran of Britain's former Ambassador to Tehran, Brian Hook, who wrote about it in his book, A Spy's Testimony. Hook had met Narguiba at a conference in Tehran and was struck by the \"extraordinary intelligence and knowledge\" he witnessed. He called her \"something of a god send\" for Britain, saying she had been \"able to do a great deal for us and to provide very reliable information.\" The Iranian ambassador to Britain, Hossein Ghandri, said that an interview between the British and Iranian foreign ministers had been held to discuss whether or not a British-Iranian activist is a British citizen, adding that Iranian women can not benefit from rights that they are not given in the constitution.

{"prompt":"The Israeli military said on Thursday that an aircraft and a tank had targeted two posts belonging to militants in the Gaza Strip after three rockets were launched at Israel . Sirens sounded in Israel","text":"The Israeli military said on Thursday that an aircraft and a tank had targeted two posts belonging to militants in the Gaza Strip after three rockets were launched at Israel. Sirens sounded in Israel Thursday night after at least three rockets hit the southern Tel Aviv city early Wednesday and Israeli media said a person was burned. In the worst attack in recent months, an Israeli soldier was hospitalized with serious burns after three rockets hit a kibbutz south of Tel Aviv early Wednesday evening. Israel's military responded with airstrikes and other strikes. The military identified the targets in Gaza as one militant training camp and two firing posts belonging to Ansar Beit al-Maqdum, the group linked to Hamas. Ansar Beit al-Maqdum has carried out at least five rocket fire attacks since Israel's 2009 military invasion of Gaza, one resulting in an injury. Ansar Beit al-Maqdum claimed responsibility for another attack on Tuesday that resulted in injury to a man and damage to two cars. Authorities said they arrested a Palestinian man in the south in connection with the rocket fire, but had no further information regarding his involvement Thursday evening. Several other rockets were fired from Gaza Thursday at Israel, but no injuries were reported. Israeli officials said Israel fired dozens of missiles on Wednesday, including at two targets where rocket fire was coming from. They said Hamas and other militants fired from Gaza. Israel fired more than 140 rockets at targets on the Gaza Strip in recent weeks -- some of which were reported to have struck civilian areas. The government of Egypt warned Wednesday morning that the border crossing and smuggling tunnels between Gaza and Egypt could be cut off overnight if more rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip. He added that even if there is no rocket fire, the border crossing could be cut off because there are only three hours' gas available to the 2 million people who live in Gaza, according to Egypt's Civil Defense. Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned the rocket fire in a statement before the country began its weekly prayers, calling the attack \"terrorist and savagery.\"\nIran has accused Israel of a new airstrike during the opening of the annual parliament session in Tehran. Israeli military sources did not immediately confirm any airstrike but said they believed the attack took place in Syria. Netanyahu said on Wednesday Israel will pursue an all-out war against Iran. Earlier Thursday, the foreign ministry said Israel believes that Iran is attempting to create a nuclear bomb by \"cheating the world of its nuclear agenda\" under sanctions. Earlier this week, Netanyahu voiced fears that the Iranian regime was about to launch a nuclear bomb. Israeli intelligence sources said the latest attack took place late Wednesday or early Thursday. The attack took place just a day before Iran\u2019s opening of its parliament\u2019s annual session.","token_len":559,"entropy":[9.5331,1.9116,2.8303,1.6925,2.1083,0.7525,3.7769,5.5478,5.2158,1.5058,2.6698,1.565,4.71,3.5256,7.9683,3.3157,0.0008,5.1445,0.9247,0.8518,1.6559,0.0695,4.5699,5.5331,2.2924,1.7055,3.4888,2.2648,1.4558,1.6397,8.9076,0.6721,1.0576,0.9029,3.3547,6.7777,2.4124,2.2403,4.2117,0.0001,1.6709,0.3962,2.6258,1.335,1.8957,5.1298,0.0227,1.8365,7.3442,2.5198,3.1192,4.1212,4.7361,1.5991,2.7834,6.8915,1.1038,8.4624,2.132,4.5998,1.6673,5.9897,2.3643,2.3168,2.8568,2.3042,0.1814,2.0699,0.4084,1.7234,0.5851,6.5633,2.0409,3.1512,2.5914,1.1662,4.9594,0.436,2.0568,1.4714,10.1363,0.0076,0.0005,0.0001,6.199,0.0223,1.3422,0.004,3.4242,0.4486,4.6623,0.3011,3.1254,1.7831,1.0542,6.3079,1.7797,3.2144,1.6607,4.0082,3.4887,2.733,1.867,2.4426,7.2296,0.5901,2.7317,2.9011,2.5636,0.3825,6.5275,3.846,4.9475,0.3741,1.2891,1.5092,8.2536,4.0305,3.6822,0.0012,5.1454,0.0263,2.2449,0.0148,0.9137,0.0156,0.0041,0.0022,9.3749,7.3857,1.5301,2.2426,2.3679,4.4203,0.0224,0.6218,0.6919,4.3272,0.0018,0.3992,0.0007,0.0201,0.0011,0.0006,0.0018,0.0015,0.0018,1.9711,3.569,0.0064,4.7377,0.0002,2.9491,2.1021,5.1886,0.3093,2.1587,4.419,1.635,5.888,2.1236,5.3151,0.3284,0.2797,1.5795,5.9425,9.2396,0.0103,4.1234,4.8372,1.6302,4.1154,0.0023,0.0835,0.0012,0.0044,0.0007,0.0018,0.0017,0.0019,0.0023,3.6745,0.0528,0.0473,5.6341,2.4057,1.1195,3.703,2.0907,3.3919,0.0024,5.2506,1.5404,1.2658,3.6536,2.6575,6.0066,0.0484,3.4269,3.0705,0.7574,6.6499,1.0754,2.9554,3.4587,1.7764,2.9963,1.6035,1.8448,2.2169,5.3422,6.0935,0.0855,0.0207,0.5063,3.5993,1.8701,1.9558,1.4283,4.9004,0.8566,1.524,0.8001,4.8285,1.4873,4.096,7.9628,2.7253,0.0916,5.3351,2.8012,1.8678,1.2772,0.7488,1.3365,0.9035,3.4014,3.5131,1.801,0.9818,2.7048,2.1807,2.0547,0.2366,0.0059,0.2862,3.3881,2.6088,0.5576,5.0673,2.464,5.1584,0.1138,2.1683,3.5915,2.06,2.1949,2.3231,1.2551,3.4694,3.0032,6.152,5.0065,1.1981,0.8763,6.9482,0.1061,0.5076,3.6831,0.4899,5.07,3.219,2.0024,2.4832,2.0385,3.9355,1.2055,4.3472,3.1474,3.1157,2.7287,0.4501,5.3331,0.7575,1.769,3.4809,3.2326,3.7456,1.4655,0.2643,1.5839,3.2643,1.2532,6.3065,3.6503,1.4397,0.7189,1.6191,6.2462,0.514,0.9405,4.1115,3.7961,1.4293,0.6734,1.7568,4.7126,3.1695,4.2079,4.545,2.8136,5.0274,0.2821,2.5646,7.1563,1.601,6.3898,5.1513,1.4179,1.7434,1.0016,0.0634,0.83,1.1561,0.6328,4.5029,1.1757,5.4691,2.0053,5.4783,0.7625,0.6547,0.2451,1.6495,1.8733,1.0718,0.0143,0.3955,7.0312,3.5691,0.1949,5.9753,0.5361,3.172,2.6737,0.6185,3.2974,0.1256,0.7574,1.9563,2.2155,1.0178,1.1994,0.3193,1.7395,0.1722,4.5761,3.5184,1.1917,4.5107,3.2355,4.969,4.0611,7.7814,2.8671,1.8447,1.9348,5.9888,1.5399,0.7017,2.2068,0.3695,0.6825,1.1222,2.898,1.9105,0.001,1.9875,0.0636,6.061,1.5279,1.0731,2.5542,2.2563,5.3111,0.0209,1.0722,0.6983,0.0002,0.0315,3.4408,0.3746,1.6794,0.4091,2.7908,0.5423,0.5483,5.9019,1.3542,4.9003,7.4077,1.8045,4.8824,3.5133,2.9909,2.2061,2.1522,1.4096,1.0979,5.2188,2.4442,9.8322,0.0243,0.0002,0.3633,3.3093,16.6525,3.1425,3.4761,0.6901,0.089,4.2863,4.6899,8.985,5.7312,1.1268,7.2472,0.804,1.0468,7.1651,7.0604,1.28,1.4583,2.5028,1.5761,3.8617,3.199,2.7903,6.2975,0.0041,1.3686,2.0035,4.1852,4.2793,5.1778,1.3755,2.7716,2.5309,1.1509,2.2142,4.3985,0.0024,1.6635,5.2166,0.353,5.0089,1.2713,2.8561,1.1024,4.7701,4.0538,5.4013,2.3952,4.1378,0.0657,0.0034,1.5277,0.8839,2.0083,1.7259,5.603,2.7961,0.1912,2.0069,5.1087,0.4379,0.9219,1.9966,6.3792,2.1483,1.5587,1.358,3.8361,0.0612,3.4937,0.4943,2.1266,2.4496,2.7456,3.5806,6.9625,0.3847,2.8165,2.6435,5.8462,2.5215,1.8356,6.9295,2.4928,5.5723,5.2122,0.7402,5.0902,1.9077,0.5922,0.0792,3.1798,6.5308,5.392,0.6828,1.8046,3.3424,1.3209,2.1701,6.1032,0.003,2.1817,0.5536,0.8722,2.1707,1.365,3.7992,3.8246,2.4064,0.9647,1.9889,4.0269,1.7962,4.4051,0.0024,4.3301,1.2591,4.5952,0.0852,0.0554,1.6395,1.8586,2.3145,3.0843,0.003,3.2696,2.8825,1.6883,1.6918,3.3681,16.4918,8.8618,2.7644,5.4495,0.3388,1.6061,4.9698,7.4706,0.2884,1.2934,1.0197,0.7475,0.7717]}

That is the official version of the situation, which comes in contrast with the report of the Washington Post, where the US diplomat has said that they have no interest in joining the delegation.\n\u201cWe have neither the desire nor the intention to take part in the dialogue with Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime,\u201d \u2013 said a senior U.S. administration official who requested anonymity.\nSo that the U.S. diplomats are not a part of the delegation, will include, at first, \u201conly representatives whose presence in Pyongyang would serve as a guarantee that they will not be arrested, and do not come back to the United States\u201d, - explained the official.\nThe decision was made based on the assessment that the U.S. delegation would not take part in the negotiations in order not to be \u201cguaranteed\u201d of their return to the United States and not to be subjected to \u201cinterested negotiations\u201d with North Korea.\nAccording to the latest edition of the Washington Post, the U.S. administration has asked the regime of Kim Jong-un to send to Washington for the first time diplomats from six countries with which Washington maintained direct contacts before the signing of the nuclear agreement.\nIt should be noted that the six countries included in the decision are China, France and Great Britain, members of the three European Union countries, and Japan, South Korea, the United States and Russia, the main architects of the nuclear agreement.\n\"It is not clear how these countries expect it, where their missions will start, what this will mean for the talks, - said a senior U.S. diplomatic service official.\nAfter the execution of six people, they were sentenced to up to 40 years in prison for espionagem. In the opinion of the State Department, the U.S. authorities acted in accordance with the law.\nPrevious articleIran\u2019s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif: We must not expect a return of the JCPoA within a month or so!","token_len":560,"entropy":[2.6881,0.7637,2.83,0.0076,2.4772,2.1407,1.9669,0.4455,1.5729,1.4955,0.0149,2.3415,3.6143,0.0314,6.4004,6.3216,0.7284,0.3391,2.4475,0.0405,5.3351,6.5279,0.1311,1.858,0.0135,1.726,9.624,0.1873,2.845,1.8849,0.0135,4.8706,0.0005,0.3785,0.0692,2.4896,1.2088,0.7432,4.044,3.7999,1.6117,5.1358,0.0428,5.2761,7.817,4.3621,0.1732,3.5269,1.4128,0.6571,1.7938,3.3203,0.9883,3.51,0.0004,0.4482,0.1136,3.7832,1.8161,0.237,2.901,0.6453,4.0532,9.3973,11.1255,7.3105,4.2897,4.5212,0.0295,0.7621,4.0612,1.347,2.6809,0.0181,0.7048,5.4054,0.4116,2.8286,3.6121,0.1285,2.8108,3.576,4.167,1.9284,7.2046,0.3783,0.0215,0.0026,0.0009,1.0888,17.9338,9.3794,1.2751,1.2041,4.5045,1.5178,3.4562,5.5599,0.0023,0.0009,2.388,11.9362,11.6233,3.3253,3.2133,7.1883,2.3331,2.1918,6.7658,1.8176,0.9855,0.0016,1.2028,3.0595,0.0118,1.0332,0.7064,1.6771,5.2397,1.6916,6.3999,0.8993,7.7411,0.0472,4.8576,4.3215,3.8826,6.8821,1.5162,1.0182,4.5111,4.1368,5.5611,0.3913,0.8102,4.8988,8.9808,7.0831,1.2207,3.4902,6.055,7.2207,8.3832,7.2726,1.8278,5.7922,2.6362,2.4425,3.4007,4.667,0.4281,1.3902,4.031,1.5035,1.5656,4.3921,3.5052,4.0737,1.99,1.2101,6.3993,1.8401,1.4301,5.1763,0.8077,2.6794,4.1128,1.5243,2.5755,4.5808,3.428,1.7305,0.6227,4.8204,2.4073,3.1157,3.5798,0.0411,5.5666,0.6955,2.1243,0.6696,0.52,11.4787,8.1086,8.6399,2.0763,7.6712,1.9906,3.5686,0.1083,0.2072,3.4483,0.506,4.2467,0.6626,0.0995,1.8126,4.7968,1.6926,4.3139,0.2051,1.5264,0.1265,9.0489,6.6481,6.9384,0.4919,1.6326,3.5266,7.9764,8.2611,3.2609,3.817,0.6248,2.5249,0.0006,0.0898,0.0086,4.2899,0.0115,2.9935,3.263,0.0109,1.0202,0.7234,6.1662,5.3062,3.8577,3.1357,0.0009,0.0084,0.0601,6.0942,1.7203,1.4366,4.7331,0.8149,0.0072,0.5009,2.8274,0.9987,5.0446,6.9912,4.869,3.9837,5.269,0.4378,12.7607,0.7123,4.4759,3.5804,7.794,5.3924,2.7119,1.9528,1.9507,5.6115,1.4217,0.7798,6.7855,1.0997,1.9291,1.4339,0.3653,0.6672,3.8266,1.5159,2.4485,6.0713,0.0392,4.4593,3.9252,0.7601,0.8756,1.369,0.0036,6.7223,2.422,2.5495,4.7663,6.0553,0.3134,0.8702,0.4368,0.3771,1.814,5.2208,3.0108,1.2992,4.4758,0.0688,1.0837,4.0869,1.1914,1.0085,2.7918,0.0008,0.0053,0.0678,5.066,1.1083,1.1727,4.7156,0.3472,0.1514,1.0521,2.4888,3.9075,3.5174,4.864,0.0257,2.979,14.7198,0.0886,7.1383,0.3179,0.052,5.0111,2.1227,5.6478,2.2647,1.7049,1.2277,0.3268,0.398,0.0028,3.6287,3.9468,0.7622,0.6858,3.2542,0.0086,12.26,0.0233,12.6989,4.9492,2.5296,0.4928,4.2415,1.1359,0.077,0.5597,0.416,3.6734,0.0538,0.5293,5.8518,7.0948,0.0112,0.6208,2.098,0.1166,0.5654,0.9835,2.5229,0.0008,0.0052,0.0429,4.3316,1.6004,4.0477,0.9315,5.5568,1.9208,0.8605,0.3385,0.0645,0.0396,0.2146,5.1173,5.0923,2.5197,3.7408,2.8728,3.0583,0.2774,4.6723,1.5551,5.3592,0.8455,4.2816,3.1557,4.891,10.4246,4.4322,2.7416,4.3422,1.0995,4.2224,0.046,0.0949,2.0373,0.652,1.0131,0.6934,3.5123,5.1321,0.3651,0.2525,0.1625,0.8942,5.3808,1.8497,3.9201,0.2943,0.1213,7.1127,1.6052,3.695,0.045,4.8791,4.3028,5.2456,0.0003,1.2146,7.5358,0.0089,0.3035,6.1766,5.1472,0.1852,1.5815,1.5861,0.8708,3.3906,1.2631,5.6691,0.0062,1.0197,2.0848,0.7643,0.3291,0.6892,1.9682,2.2362,2.9996,6.2787,6.9404,0.0943,0.1279,1.7658,0.7716,0.4016,0.4921,3.8009,3.0323,0.6636,2.3946,2.4826,2.2171,3.7119,1.4656,7.4115,5.5599,3.1229,6.0139,4.2397,8.1395,2.4239,6.1333,1.2581,2.3582,6.2349,2.5544,1.2269,0.2288,1.2858,4.1529,1.3781,6.9637,4.5574,2.7219,0.3306,0.7348,0.0006,0.0026,0.001,5.6409,8.3769,0.0587,0.7078,0.3386,5.5534,1.049,8.2647,0.1452,5.7122,2.6629,1.5549,5.0271,1.6706,4.9258,0.2155,4.8862,0.0025,4.6567,0.0844,0.228,0.1659,2.2215,11.5912,12.5435,11.3518,3.8111,3.1486,4.0762,1.9849,6.0993,0.0612,0.6387,2.3555,0.0159,0.2546,1.3413,3.8571,0.001,0.0045,0.0653,5.5226,7.4643,1.6963,3.0227,0.0076,0.9012,2.802,2.041,0.66,8.51,5.0835,14.3229,10.3641,4.6685,0.1034,3.4539,0.3539,3.9505,0.0002,0.0001,0.0,3.6415,3.5957,3.4718,2.4754,5.9488,2.703,2.863,0.8522,2.1533,6.1134,0.0082,8.2204,0.091,7.9811,1.9059,2.3828,3.0551,2.2577,6.0989]}

{"prompt":"The leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement , Luigi Di Maio , said on Monday that Italy should quit the euro zone unless it manages to change the bloc s rules on public finances .","text":"The leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, Luigi Di Maio, said on Monday that Italy should quit the euro zone unless it manages to change the bloc s rules on public finances. He made the remarks on his first day of meetings with European leaders as Italy enters a period of uncertainty following an election in April that saw a resurgence in the centre-right anti-immigration League. D e M a o, the leader of Italy s centre-right 5-Star Movement, is in Brussels to meet leaders of the Group of Seven ( G7 ) countries on Monday. D e M a o s mission, which includes a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, the leaders of Germany, Spain, Canada, Britain and Italy, aims to draw up a strategy to combat climate change and improve the EU s economic outlook. The talks will also address European policy in the new year, including a discussion of how to resolve the ongoing Brexit dispute. A report last month found that Britain s failure to strike a trade deal with the EU by the end of November would have a devastating impact on the UK economy. EU leaders are planning to meet on Saturday to discuss the fate of Britain s future in the bloc. The EU s finance ministers will discuss the rules governing the public finances of member states at a meeting in Luxembourg Thursday and Friday. The leaders will be meeting in Luxembourg on Saturday to discuss the fate of Britain s future in the EU. Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says it is hard to imagine another solution than a \u201cno deal divorce,\u201d after British Prime Minister Theresa May said the country s exit from the EU was becoming increasingly inevitable. \u201cIt is increasingly evident that an exit in the conditions we expect from the United Kingdom will only succeed through a hard Brexit,\u201d Barnier told television station RTL. EU negotiators say a no-deal Brexit would not leave the bloc united, but would lead to a painful adjustment from the United Kingdom, which would not be able to sign up to the bloc s single market or trade deals with the rest of the world. On Monday, EU ministers are set to meet and to decide on a list of potential issues to be addressed. The issue of Britain s financial ties to the EU could be central \u2013 with May seeking guarantees that the EU will allow the UK to have access to a euro area budget or rescue fund if the UK leaves the bloc. Macron says he hopes to have a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit resolution to propose to his US counterpart next month, to keep in line with the US-led negotiations on a post-Brexit trade deal.

{"prompt":"A Seoul court on Friday found Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin guilty of breach of trust and embezzlement and sentenced him to 20 months in prison , suspended for two years , leaving him free","text":"A Seoul court on Friday found Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin guilty of breach of trust and embezzlement and sentenced him to 20 months in prison, suspended for two years, leaving him free to run for office next year.\nAs Lotte Group, with Shin\u2019s father as Chairman, grew from a struggling steel empire to one of Asia\u2019s largest conglomerates, he and his family\u2019s wealth grew enormously.\nThe court concluded that Shin received more than 100 million won ($89,900) in profits and a million won in expenses from the embezzlement, for which he handed over a mobile phone to officials as a warning.\nThe court said Shin had intentionally hidden a total of about 6.3 billion won worth of Lotte Group\u2019s assets from investigators, including about 700 million won in property that had not been reported to the Ministry of Justice.\nLotte Group is currently facing a criminal investigation by the National Intelligence Service over Shin\u2019s potential involvement in the kidnapping and murder of Korean war POWs.\nA lawyer for Shin said, \u201cLotte Group has no idea who the culprits are,\u201d adding that the sentence \u201cis far below what he should have been given.\u201d\nA top prosecutor also criticized the court\u2019s ruling, saying \u201cit is not only inconsistent with the prosecutions of other similar cases, but also isn\u2019t based on the merits.\u201d\nA former prosecutor said on the condition of anonymity that the Lotte case is \u201cprobably the finest example of a government\u2019s fightback against its rivals.\u201d\nLotte Group was one of the most vocal players in supporting Shin\u2019s bid for a second term in the November general election, a move that may have brought him political clout outside his business empire.\nThe company has said it is investigating whether there were wrongdoing in that election campaign funding.\nIn July, the Seoul District Court sentenced Sonny Lambrecht, a former vice chairman of Lotte Group, to six years and five months in prison for money laundering and failing to report foreign transactions to the Ministry of Justice.\nIn 2007, Lambrecht also was arrested and charged with wire fraud against Lotte Group that amounted to about 30 million won, but he was acquitted after an appeal.\nThis is the second high-profile case of a ruling president\u2019s business being exposed as criminal wrongdoing in less than a month.\nPresident Park Geun-hye announced last week that she was stepping down from the presidency after being criticized for leaking state secrets to the media.\nSpark a conversation and win points with our exclusive FREE Piano Sheet Music!

{"prompt":"Catalonia s independence movement could suffer a serious setback in elections this month , according to a poll published on Sunday , which suggests separatist parties will narrowly fail to

will narrowly fail to secure a majority in the Catalan parliament.\nThe findings of a poll for Catalan radio station RAC-1 were a blow for leaders of the separatist parties, who were previously predicting that the CUP, a leftist group, could defeat the ruling party, CiU.\nThe poll suggests the Catalan parliament will narrowly fail to secure a majority of seats for those pro-Separatist parties.\nThe Catalan parliament, which was recently suspended by Spain on an overdue election order, is expected to continue functioning through April.\n\" Our results tell us that the Catalan parliament will remain the same, with the same governments and that there will be no victory nor defeat for independentism, \" said the poll.\nThe poll found that pro-Separatists would gain one seat, from 51 to 50.\nMeanwhile, the anti-independent groups CUP and ICV, currently lead by the anti-independentist leader, Ernest Lluch, would lose two seats each, to 44 and 31 respectively.\nOn Sunday, the Independent Citizens of Catalonia ( In Cat ), a leftist group not associated with the separatist parties, held a public rally in Barcelona.\nIt included the slogan \" No vote, no Catalan parliament \" and called for a no-vote campaign in Catalonia.\nThe polls in Spain also show that people do not want Catalan leaders to attempt a referendum on independence any time soon.\nThe poll conducted by the Catalonian regional government found an overwhelming percentage of Catalan people opposed to such a referendum now, at 91%.\nIn a public announcement in front of the United Nations in New York, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the Spanish government and parliament to stop plans for a referendum on Catalonia, saying such a vote would be against international law.\nIn a radio interview on Sunday morning, Catalan Prime Minister Artur Mas rejected plans for a referendum, saying the only valid path toward independence was a political solution to the current situation.\nMas told Catalunya Radio, which was broadcasting in Catalan outside Catalonia : \" Our idea to ask the Catalan people for their opinion in a referendum has a negative result in the polls and in the international arena...It is not a good signal. \"\n\" If we think it is good, then we must go for it, but in any case it is important that we come up with clear political proposals, like a political

{"prompt":"Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell plans to bring his party \u2019 s latest legislative effort to replace Obamacare up for a vote in the Senate next week , a number of media outlets reported on","text":"Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell plans to bring his party \u2019 s latest legislative effort to replace Obamacare up for a vote in the Senate next week, a number of media outlets reported on Thursday. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., plans to introduce a bill to repeal and replace the federal Affordable Care Act later this week in a rare legislative push that is expected to further complicate the 2016 Republican presidential race. The proposal by the Senate Republican leader, reported to be a stripped down version of a similar bill championed by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, would seek to repeal the individual mandate for health insurance that was placed on the Affordable Care Act under President Obama and would replace it with state-based health insurance options. The idea of a stand-alone health bill has been floated by nearly every senator since the Senate Republicans launched a series of votes to repeal and replace Obamacare, known as the tax-free bill. Obamacare has become a divisive issue in the Republican Party, with many Republicans advocating a more limited repeal of most provisions and a gradual replacement with state-backed health plans. Rep. Paul, a leading member of the House Freedom Caucus, has been working with other House Republicans to create a bill that would keep most of Obamacare in place, but let states opt out of the individual mandate. [Full Story ]\nPresident Obama has signed an emergency regulation aimed at expanding access to birth control coverage for children, officials told CNN on Thursday. The Health and Human Services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, told CNN she hopes the rule will provide more options for low-income women. \u201cThis is in response to demand for access and affordability, and this is a step in that direction,\u201d Sebelius said. The rule, which was previously known as the contraceptive mandate, was part of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law. The President has asked that the rule be kept secret until he signs it. Sebelius stated that the rule expands the definition of \u201ccontraceptive coverage\u201d under the law, and provides more detailed information on how to calculate \u201ccontraceptive subsidies,\u201d which is how much people would get back from the health insurance companies, Sebelius told CNN. The new rule will allow for two types of subsidies\u2014one that covers a certain percentage of the costs of a certain number of certain contraceptive procedures, and a second one covering the full cost of the procedure.

They have this zero-sum game that nobody wants. It's going to take something very difficult, possibly painful.\" Cornyn argued Democrats should take the blame for not reaching a compromise. \u201c I think that the Democrats say it all the time, that they say, \u2018The responsibility for reaching agreement is with Republicans,'\u201d he said. Republicans should feel worse about a tax compromise, Cornyn said on the morning show. \u201c We should always say, 'We took the lead,'\u201d he said. \u201c We should feel bad when we\u2019ve asked for a deal \u2014 that we don\u2019t get one, because we know that if we have all of the votes it would only matter if we were able to pass it.\" On whether to consider amending the tax bill to make its provisions permanent, Cornyn said the focus was on tax hikes that would generate the resources to fund the health care program. \u201c There will be a little bit of work involved, but it will be less intense,\" he said. \u201c We're going to continue to work on the issue once we get to that point.' \"\nFederal Reserve policymaker Stephen Hahn recently stated that the Fed is willing to consider extending its quantitative easing (QE) to the second quarter 2017, if the economy continues to perform well, Bloomberg reports.\nThe Fed is planning to continue $85 billion per month of asset purchase programs at least through the March meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, if GDP growth remains strong, Hahn told Bloomberg when asked whether the Fed would consider extending its buying programs beyond the current December meeting.\nThe Federal Reserve's new asset purchase programs will continue to allow investors to get cheap bank cash to inject into the real economy, Hahn pointed out.\nThe U.S. economy is on track to grow at a robust 3% this year, the highest in the past 60 years, despite several risks. Still, Hahn said the Fed will be more than prepared to cut rates as needed should it see signs that the economy is slowing.","token_len":563,"entropy":[7.2936,0.4147,1.6582,5.4468,0.0584,0.015,0.0318,5.5766,3.0035,7.8425,0.4018,0.0,3.1621,2.1361,2.7476,1.9452,2.1085,3.5633,4.2706,4.7018,1.6223,6.3494,0.2027,2.6101,0.0912,0.8207,1.2744,3.4209,1.7003,2.7005,2.7097,0.5192,4.0653,0.6684,14.2951,6.9883,7.5318,2.5268,2.4938,4.4098,1.8731,0.4612,1.4301,2.4675,4.9443,0.0029,0.0068,3.6895,6.7294,6.6571,14.6858,9.4347,4.6207,2.3293,0.0472,1.4841,4.7589,2.6572,1.4392,4.5734,1.4978,1.3208,5.4011,6.8088,1.7782,0.3155,0.7911,2.4297,1.3723,2.6961,4.6928,1.8347,1.2217,1.5273,1.4167,2.3426,0.9365,1.8404,0.2946,6.5187,3.2849,2.1255,0.9917,1.6638,0.2832,0.2842,0.2765,5.588,2.1928,0.838,3.7863,4.1012,0.3209,0.8754,5.18,5.8606,7.2169,4.5995,3.1333,6.1505,0.1088,5.5498,0.1984,1.2772,0.0706,0.0685,3.1877,2.6438,4.6533,0.1462,2.8479,5.0492,1.9542,2.0125,5.019,0.0028,1.7526,3.4604,1.771,0.3794,1.8603,1.2935,3.3045,3.6803,2.0921,3.5725,1.3651,4.1528,1.2962,2.6326,4.3821,5.7246,3.7012,2.9696,2.6518,5.483,3.4486,0.1184,0.3175,3.7366,0.3017,3.9657,4.4369,7.0544,3.9967,3.0878,4.6154,9.4701,1.2379,0.1662,1.9169,2.8974,5.1633,1.0284,4.4171,2.6164,0.8561,2.7129,0.0081,2.0971,5.0062,2.4765,3.2368,2.1152,5.4774,5.7757,1.8337,3.7662,0.0034,5.9874,5.2956,2.7025,3.5691,1.8774,3.2419,0.234,1.9031,3.9448,0.7798,2.7758,1.4924,2.7902,0.0974,2.9075,1.1995,2.106,2.7647,2.7708,6.9546,2.8633,3.7291,0.6416,0.0192,1.2574,2.778,1.0867,4.9883,1.7369,8.1052,7.0631,6.0705,7.363,1.459,6.8306,4.4248,0.9316,3.0962,2.8819,7.7704,1.3062,6.3567,3.1698,0.1513,0.269,6.9843,3.588,6.7946,8.0214,0.838,4.8884,2.3094,6.8466,1.8788,2.0647,0.0069,0.3866,5.467,3.0282,5.8927,1.5041,0.488,1.1996,0.4046,2.8613,3.1241,6.2739,3.2561,0.8292,2.417,1.785,5.6872,1.6781,3.7343,3.524,0.6684,0.3739,0.7384,0.2193,0.3393,1.0767,0.1036,1.6445,1.9352,3.4473,1.7255,4.5639,1.0814,5.9357,0.5372,4.1115,7.1329,2.2097,1.5068,1.8882,4.5955,3.147,1.8822,3.2858,0.2727,0.3658,0.2632,3.5806,4.4742,2.5555,3.3997,0.9932,4.2724,1.7185,2.8176,0.578,4.3497,5.6201,1.9862,0.688,1.5505,4.6234,2.2003,5.0608,5.4135,1.2807,1.1135,4.1717,0.8585,0.0085,2.1543,1.5606,2.5434,6.2392,3.9518,4.0968,4.9881,7.265,0.0042,0.3211,1.5946,2.4978,1.3929,2.4474,5.1376,2.9955,4.0277,0.2822,0.2643,0.0042,0.2947,2.8862,6.9488,3.5681,0.5479,3.9321,4.0202,2.7848,1.4893,5.3957,3.9695,7.8719,1.3939,3.4823,0.949,5.1096,0.1961,2.093,0.934,1.3276,0.0927,3.9629,3.7101,0.335,1.5303,5.2393,0.7899,0.1639,3.6131,3.6743,1.2543,0.8622,2.3034,1.2522,0.7114,6.9197,4.9859,2.5081,0.4354,0.0723,0.1956,0.9692,0.0359,1.8205,3.2114,0.8301,0.0173,3.6387,0.3467,1.6489,1.1043,1.8837,3.1482,7.7172,0.7252,1.118,2.4917,2.8082,0.328,9.6749,4.764,2.1129,12.3626,2.941,6.9727,2.2055,5.364,5.6595,4.9444,5.9968,4.5113,0.4659,1.2667,2.3124,1.8964,4.4921,0.0256,3.0967,3.4467,2.6785,3.6869,0.0038,2.4586,0.0086,0.0018,0.0705,4.6425,3.2959,4.7672,1.5525,4.1233,2.225,3.1122,1.4978,2.7849,1.8822,0.1266,4.0155,1.1704,2.3208,9.7201,1.8497,0.1575,1.4085,6.2089,1.322,1.8497,5.0833,0.2102,3.0202,7.8585,4.4774,0.4187,6.021,1.2214,1.4534,5.6098,3.8077,3.1919,4.2226,5.1599,0.4969,1.0035,6.7198,4.3954,4.0525,8.5056,0.043,0.1522,0.3024,0.8727,5.6678,5.2959,3.4509,2.3038,2.6977,1.6633,4.5755,0.0116,1.9096,0.6684,7.227,0.4066,2.7222,0.6982,0.6281,0.9284,1.7909,0.6862,3.3482,7.7926,3.3858,4.4671,0.6631,3.0883,5.4832,2.6659,0.3688,0.8929,1.9268,2.8154,0.1111,2.4531,4.976,5.3253,1.2108,3.0922,2.4856,2.6808,1.6026,4.9248,3.4721,0.0941,5.523,5.8002,6.6297,4.6953,2.4543,8.2078,0.9409,0.3827,6.3549,0.6493,1.4113,2.2166,0.0017,5.2752,0.0585,0.4398,0.8188,1.7928,4.1779,0.0005,0.0025,0.0018,1.4754,1.5689,3.7895,0.5397,0.1787,1.4343,0.5784,1.2109,3.7965,1.8382,3.2477,2.5461,0.0487,0.4724,2.9452,4.5086,3.0948,2.6921,2.5744,5.2244,0.0854,0.5007,3.8748,5.3073,6.228,2.4788,7.012,0.0296,2.7827,0.01,0.8527,1.2551,0.8801,2.3122,2.9117,4.0794,3.1414,3.9697,0.158,4.9374,2.6826,3.5207,4.4201,6.9228,2.483,2.6863,3.7239,1.97,0.7447,0.4101,0.428,2.2241,1.3657]}

{"prompt":"California sued the U.S. Department of Justice on Monday over federal restrictions on some law enforcement grants to so-called sanctuary cities , continuing a legal counterattack by Democrats against President Donald Trump \u2019 s administration","text":"California sued the U.S. Department of Justice on Monday over federal restrictions on some law enforcement grants to so-called sanctuary cities, continuing a legal counterattack by Democrats against President Donald Trump \u2019 s administration.\n\u201cThe Department of Justice is using the threat of government funding to intimidate our city and its leaders,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.\nBecerra, who is working with Gov. Gavin Newsom to try push legislation through the Legislature that would expand sanctuary cities and criminalize immigration abuses, urged the court to block or modify the Department of Justice \u2019 s efforts.\n\u201cThe Department of Justice \u2019 s efforts to intimidate sanctuary cities are inconsistent with the core mission of our government \u2013 to protect the civil liberties of all Americans,\u201d he said.\nCrowds swarmed to the courthouse in San Francisco on Monday, and as they filed into the building, many wore T-shirts that read \u201cSanctuary Now!\u201d\n\u201cThis is to say no more to the Trump Administration\u2019 s actions threatening the ability of California to build a better future,\u201d Becerra tweeted.\nSupporters of sanctuary cities gathered outside after the court announcement. Some supporters of sanctuary cities are expected to continue to protest.\n\u201cThis is just the latest in a string of executive actions Trump has taken to stop people from entering the U.S. without a visa,\u201d the group said on Twitter on Monday.\nBut sanctuary cities have not been the only targets of D.C. officials. Last week, President Trump signed a series of policies aimed at cutting off aid to organizations that support immigrants.\nTrump \u2019 s policy restrictions have hit a wide range of organizations that provide services to migrants. They include child welfare services, legal aid and public housing.\nPresident Trump \u2019 s executive orders were the latest setback for President Trump \u2019 s immigration campaign and his administration, which has suffered numerous setbacks in recent weeks over his controversial policies.\nA few days ago, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key piece of congressional immigration law, an action that prompted strong reactions across the nation.\nAfter the high court\u2019s decision last week, it will take a few more more steps before the law can be fully rewritten. The Senate is expected to meet later this month to propose legislation to rewrite the law \u2014 legislation that lawmakers have already discussed in the past.\nThe Supreme Court is making the ruling on a 5-2 vote against two other judges who would have allowed the law to remain in effect. But Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote an opinion, joined by Justices Elena Kagan, Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer, that would not let the court decide the law\u2019s fate.","token_len":565,"entropy":[11.2178,1.2061,3.6307,0.0205,0.0061,0.0067,1.6242,0.0011,1.0041,2.539,2.8092,3.3464,5.3993,5.9809,0.2347,6.4716,6.2444,0.0719,4.8775,1.9276,7.4121,0.0123,0.0005,1.0665,0.0483,1.7719,11.0692,0.7464,3.3179,8.958,0.9632,1.5172,4.7415,3.0601,2.0141,0.9384,0.0071,15.6568,5.8045,9.0235,4.0042,0.4715,0.2635,16.6158,5.5835,4.6205,3.3366,0.0364,0.0337,2.6079,4.6334,1.6401,4.9105,0.1428,5.9166,3.9394,0.4039,4.0466,6.2971,4.8929,2.062,2.9065,3.2474,1.5023,9.4747,6.7135,8.1894,1.2078,0.0001,0.2434,0.0001,0.0,0.0,1.2188,0.6352,0.0767,0.2853,0.586,1.3368,8.5389,0.0029,0.0009,2.6665,0.7838,1.5795,5.3235,1.2594,4.9043,0.0125,8.161,0.0005,0.0,1.3951,5.2318,10.5341,3.5211,2.6195,1.2315,1.2058,2.4545,0.3686,3.285,2.271,0.4619,3.0165,4.7895,0.0635,3.9522,6.9901,0.2469,5.6142,1.678,3.8134,0.1399,4.0138,7.5103,4.2575,0.8749,4.3106,0.393,0.0269,9.3643,0.8708,2.0931,5.286,1.1869,0.2552,1.6208,0.4892,1.5708,1.7079,0.1984,0.0222,3.1682,0.1817,0.6838,4.0865,1.2412,0.78,4.6198,0.3779,1.9557,6.8857,0.0389,0.7843,4.9518,2.7049,0.083,1.6563,3.319,6.2237,0.9111,0.5616,1.0404,3.0557,1.046,0.2749,0.7742,0.9356,2.0698,0.9817,0.9189,3.5422,0.2697,0.1494,0.2717,6.9466,6.3262,1.1273,6.9823,0.5494,3.153,1.0447,1.7522,2.0293,2.5632,0.2454,1.7805,0.4743,1.8801,3.845,4.1449,2.9553,5.8967,1.5483,0.2959,3.396,0.621,4.0819,5.027,3.8667,0.0032,0.0071,1.7652,0.5395,5.4074,3.1125,4.2298,1.411,6.8581,1.498,1.3744,1.7149,1.6868,1.6589,0.3032,3.9853,0.9075,6.5399,3.696,4.4583,2.7763,3.3035,1.5995,3.1035,2.0727,1.9174,2.8146,0.5725,4.4557,7.6865,2.029,6.5407,0.0861,3.6565,1.1613,4.6318,1.4566,3.8673,1.2844,3.5736,0.311,0.3684,0.5406,0.0006,0.0016,5.5232,0.2696,0.3178,6.1969,0.5436,2.3137,0.1648,3.7566,0.9985,6.6542,1.0812,2.1093,4.5414,0.932,4.1095,3.6761,1.7821,0.4775,0.0949,3.8174,6.4368,0.0759,5.0578,1.4961,1.9382,2.8265,1.1581,1.4792,0.222,2.7559,0.3433,5.1649,1.2731,0.8959,0.9863,0.0867,1.9493,0.004,5.8431,0.5369,3.975,0.3919,0.6156,0.9899,5.6374,4.3563,0.3705,1.9509,0.4481,2.028,0.0007,0.0009,0.4564,3.0447,1.2761,1.2726,1.4829,0.5124,0.6583,3.8713,5.7169,1.8974,2.3846,1.3109,4.8429,0.2568,0.193,0.3028,5.1482,4.6174,0.2824,2.1192,3.3825,1.2497,1.8295,0.2191,2.4985,0.536,7.7794,0.1241,0.1163,0.8159,2.2306,1.8507,3.3333,0.8869,0.129,3.7984,1.0234,1.3189,1.3035,4.4537,0.0012,6.9003,2.7007,0.0346,5.1262,2.3231,5.6024,0.1221,6.5797,0.5693,3.4303,2.4591,2.1169,0.645,3.5831,6.709,0.4324,0.735,4.0118,6.8967,2.3382,5.5208,3.6271,4.4135,1.3409,0.0077,2.2826,2.1539,2.4111,1.6416,0.6854,4.3128,2.3918,4.6892,0.2531,6.7763,1.2645,3.6654,0.2793,4.7186,0.8441,2.1765,4.2295,2.7316,0.95,0.6606,5.3828,0.4962,3.6969,0.0282,0.1573,3.623,1.4725,4.36,4.8591,2.3909,6.2171,0.6635,5.1948,0.5914,1.1258,0.0147,0.0415,3.0124,5.9631,3.3915,1.782,1.6904,2.1879,1.9673,1.0557,8.0854,4.4331,0.4289,1.1113,1.3853,1.3873,4.7416,2.8161,2.7235,4.4113,0.8953,0.5157,4.4583,4.2793,1.001,0.8013,0.1035,1.609,3.3281,0.0007,0.0076,0.0036,1.9792,0.002,3.0778,0.0131,1.1716,2.0964,4.8139,0.0477,8.0394,1.4667,1.1934,0.9815,5.1159,2.6092,0.726,6.1016,6.7033,3.4542,3.0459,0.1487,1.9164,0.393,0.7126,5.0697,1.0291,1.8745,0.0212,10.1841,1.0319,4.5039,0.5652,4.2885,0.4987,0.3296,4.6433,4.6681,2.452,2.5699,3.1288,1.6523,7.8255,5.8469,1.363,0.7792,4.7134,2.102,0.5897,3.197,4.6079,0.9924,2.9318,5.8678,2.4413,0.7711,0.0088,6.4368,3.473,0.3461,0.7113,0.6989,6.2347,2.4165,1.119,2.6206,0.3629,0.2503,5.4551,5.2688,0.387,6.435,1.8074,3.2336,4.5186,2.7312,1.3483,0.3119,0.3766,0.4537,2.2129,2.8527,0.0022,2.4755,7.342,2.7641,4.8481,1.5321,3.0053,6.2101,0.082,3.867,1.1145,7.6955,5.7246,3.3127,4.6167,1.1141,6.0702,0.1317,3.4713,0.9663,2.9965,0.1067,1.9499,0.2999,1.5987,0.8173,4.334,6.2523,2.029,0.1964,2.942,3.8221,0.0866,4.1399,4.7874,0.0136,1.4893,0.0002,2.8652,0.0049,0.0,1.5291,2.7768,0.0004,0.711,2.3405,0.0117,0.0,0.1408,0.849,3.2334,3.755,4.647,0.5716,2.4785,3.2107,1.6779,1.8669,6.049,0.2465,3.8562,1.5361,0.2872]}
{"prompt":"Democratic election victories in Virginia and New Jersey showed Republicans losing more ground in suburban areas , where President Donald Trump \u2019 s unpopularity could cost them dearly in next year \u2019 s congressional races","text":"Democratic election victories in Virginia and New Jersey showed Republicans losing more ground in suburban areas, where President Donald Trump \u2019 s unpopularity could cost them dearly in next year \u2019 s congressional races.\nIn the most competitive city to go to the polls, Philadelphia, Democrat incumbent Rep. John Conyers Jr. led Republican Rep. Kevin Brady by 1.3 percentage points. But when the races are closed for precincts, the Democrat was ahead by 1.1 percentage points. Brady and his longtime Republican challenger, Rep. Joe Kennedy III, have been in a contentious battle over sexual harassment allegations, with Kennedy making a stand for an anti-abortion vote at the statehouse. While the race remained close for several weeks, it was Conyers Jr. who ultimately topped Brady.\nDemocrats had the big win because they have control of the White House, Congress and statehouses in Virginia and New Jersey. That was enough to beat Trump back into Pennsylvania, however, and win the first victory of his second term in New Hampshire. Democrats won the state, controlling both houses of the General Assembly.\nThe Democrats also picked up the governorship in Michigan \u2014 the only state Trump won in 2016, and where he has gained the most support this year and in primaries.\nThe Democratic Party also took the Senate, with Michigan\u2019s Democratic incumbent running for reelection.\nThe party also won the state Legislature in California, Virginia and Georgia. But it\u2019s losing its majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nIn this week\u2019s new poll results, Trump has his support level up to 55 percent, while Democrats\u2019 support level drops to 44 percent.\nAs for the Republican national candidates, President Trump has continued to lead in the polls, with an overwhelmingly positive view.\nIn the top two Republican candidates category, former Texas governor Perry is now second to Trump in the race for the GOP presidential nomination, while Sen. John McCain ranks eleventh among possible presidential candidates on CNN Newsroom\u2018s presidential election tracker.\nA new poll from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism shows that Trump is now the most popular Republican presidential candidate among potential voters, ahead of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and former Pennsylvania Gov. Thomas E.\nDemocrats could try to keep Trump from winning delegates in the next few days.

{"prompt":"South Africa will raise subsidies to universities to 1 percent of gross domestic product over the next five years from nearly 0.7 percent at present as recommended by a commission on higher education funding ,","text":"South Africa will raise subsidies to universities to 1 percent of gross domestic product over the next five years from nearly 0.7 percent at present as recommended by a commission on higher education funding, the News Agency of South Africa reported Monday.\n\u201cThe decision to change the funding model stems from a recommendation made by the Commission on Higher Education Funding, which was appointed by Higher Education Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to address a system where universities have been receiving very low levels of financial support in recent years,\u201d the report read.\nThe commission recommended the higher education system in South Africa should be funded in the same way as any other form of education and pay the costs of its operations, \u201cincluding operating expenses, maintenance of buildings. It has a clear mandate to establish the size, structure and cost of the funds needed for the system to survive.\u201c\n\u201cThe Commission said the country lost more than $1.1 billion in gross student fees from 2008 to 2012, but the fund amounted to $1.1 billion in 2013 and nearly $1.2 billion in the first quarter of FY 2014,\u201d it said.\nThe university sector was expected to lose $700 million of that $700 million, but the department\u2019s revenue from students\u2019 fees increased from $518 million in 2011 to $648 million in 2012 to its highest level of nearly one billion to date.\nAccording to the News Agency, some of that increase came from higher numbers of financial aid students, who account for about 30 percent of enrollment, including a 50 percent growth in financial aid students who come from outside South Africa.\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s report found that the country has no legal mandate nor a clear plan to meet the goals and objectives of its financial system, and it added that the way the Higher Education Fund (HEF) is funded is not transparent.\u201d\nThe commission had found that some institutions in the country were only raising money from other sources like fundraising, while others had been raising large sums from students\u2019 fees but not necessarily using these funds for all necessary expenses.\nIt also recommended a review of all funding received by institutions, which some said was in contravention of the Higher Education (Universities) Act, which does not provide a legal standing or mandate for the commission on higher education funding to review funds.\n\u201cWe believe that university funding should be decided by a Parliament with a mandate to do so,\u201d said the news agency report, which quoted a

operate as a sector, and instead, they would be seen as individual

Militant group Tahrir al Sham - a fighting force dominated by members of Al Qaeda - was blamed for destroying the jet at the edge of Aleppo, an eastern city where Assad's government has been under extreme pressure to end the war. The group has made a number of advances in recent weeks inside Syria. The military told reporters it was pursuing those responsible by targeting their bases.\nPresident Bush says it will take a \" long time \" for Iraq to recover its \" self reliant economy and the ability to take care of \" its own problems. \" It will take at least five to seven years for that to materialize, \" he said. Speaking at a speech in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Bush said he expects that the Iraqi government still has a hard time raising revenues, despite having just passed a law to create an income tax. \" It will take time to get the revenues up, \" he said. \" It will take time to fix up all the facilities which are in such disrepair. \"\nThe president will visit Washington on Thursday, where he will meet with members of Congress. Bush said the Iraqi government has \" serious deficiencies in its domestic intelligence \" and needs to have an \" objective intelligence agency \" in place to deal with it. He urged the country's leaders to \" stop trying to hide what is happening from the world \" and to \" accept aid \" without conditions. Bush also urged Israel to help rebuild Iraq after it was devastated by the 1991 Gulf War. \"We want every American to ask him to contribute, and we need assistance from American allies in the fight to bring democracy to Iraq, \" said Bush. Iraqis took the opportunity to question the president about the violence that has plagued the country for several months.\nIn a new report, The Pew Charitable Trusts says that only 5 percent of U.S. soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan after their tours of duty will be able to find work upon reenlisting. According to the report, 71% of returning troops who were employed before their tours of duty found jobs within a year. The Pew report also found that 63% of returning U.S. soldiers were unemployed when they were discharged from the military in 2004. Only 1.4% of workers surveyed in their study were unemployed at the time of their discharge in 2012. In contrast, only 4 percent of people in the workforce were unemployed in that same year. The Pew Charitable Trusts report also found that a higher percentage of non-white returning troops are unemployed upon discharge than are white troops. More than one-third of African Americans and Latinos, respectively, surveyed are unemployed upon discharge from active-duty service, compared to 20 percent of white soldiers.","token_len":565,"entropy":[8.001,9.1006,1.1885,5.1517,6.8269,8.1358,0.9888,2.9024,3.1773,2.4955,3.5842,4.4605,0.059,0.9445,1.4634,1.8901,1.0288,1.6324,3.4484,0.3531,1.9233,9.7013,4.0535,3.1139,8.8097,0.0121,0.1161,2.4974,7.3957,2.592,5.9766,2.2499,7.9266,0.0987,5.5359,0.0461,2.8272,0.2884,2.1044,4.4583,2.678,0.3038,6.9255,0.4773,0.9131,4.7584,1.0252,6.474,0.0093,7.4602,2.4338,4.0509,4.9787,1.4191,2.5699,4.6845,1.0861,2.5728,1.309,1.1466,4.8868,7.0164,1.1104,1.1689,2.5722,1.2666,2.7078,0.225,2.1353,3.7772,1.9122,5.2783,2.7108,2.5463,0.0013,2.0948,0.8411,2.2127,0.844,6.3912,0.9216,2.5443,2.2312,3.9946,6.499,3.4775,1.4125,1.7135,5.8189,6.0543,4.0956,6.9612,3.1186,3.7052,4.4399,1.6803,1.2565,17.3405,7.4797,5.1037,3.5668,2.3716,2.0957,2.6084,1.2624,10.3063,0.2303,2.6799,1.8051,5.0159,0.2829,2.8818,2.472,3.717,4.8795,8.3065,3.3972,1.8785,3.2609,2.8547,0.0964,4.7831,2.6463,0.0104,7.424,1.7322,1.6301,4.6428,2.5355,2.7242,3.8248,1.9327,0.158,4.6327,0.0495,4.0404,1.3824,2.1365,0.1777,1.2788,2.4569,0.4967,6.6826,0.1482,2.4964,4.8888,1.2899,0.3497,0.6834,6.6916,1.7328,0.6509,5.0277,0.8754,3.4451,4.3349,0.0056,1.8403,1.966,0.2241,0.879,0.6768,1.6557,3.9533,3.2814,1.9906,3.192,0.3034,7.523,1.167,1.8458,5.1379,0.3257,6.3803,3.6335,2.3356,4.7159,3.6047,5.9027,4.8282,0.981,3.7704,2.1753,5.0069,2.7904,5.2753,0.927,1.5252,1.5429,4.3014,1.0177,0.0772,2.5833,1.8652,1.9872,2.2092,4.8045,4.0519,2.0841,3.0229,0.6174,0.1558,0.3214,1.3126,2.7444,0.6685,0.0418,1.295,0.8091,4.7876,4.6715,4.0333,1.2759,6.5822,5.9923,1.4401,2.5159,5.5232,3.5307,0.0924,1.8536,1.0501,3.1379,2.3604,3.5701,4.6047,4.2445,3.5851,1.227,1.3143,1.8518,2.4533,0.3449,0.4302,1.3832,0.2766,3.7527,0.0039,0.5942,2.6049,4.0066,1.6851,1.7816,5.3831,0.3309,2.069,2.278,7.4757,5.1135,1.2372,1.1718,5.7969,5.4243,6.044,0.5576,4.8166,0.3015,5.108,3.4186,1.9203,5.4477,5.3859,4.5031,2.6802,3.5945,0.2028,0.6916,4.1036,0.0544,2.2156,0.2811,1.9223,4.851,1.2297,4.3276,2.1553,1.5306,0.183,2.3381,4.4443,3.1773,0.0297,4.0088,3.2158,1.4727,1.3665,4.7199,0.8202,2.1702,5.4569,0.6382,1.2538,1.8075,5.2775,10.5295,4.8687,4.7549,6.6509,0.7226,2.9443,1.6209,2.7423,7.1903,0.4082,3.4943,3.6435,3.8854,3.8187,2.0317,1.567,3.2977,0.2735,0.7651,5.0107,0.5771,0.1165,0.5271,1.6651,3.3447,3.9939,5.7146,1.7116,0.7226,5.9053,4.5544,1.2902,7.2237,3.4744,1.9721,1.9326,3.1254,6.2291,1.6032,5.7051,3.6086,2.9596,1.4513,4.5099,3.5916,3.2866,5.0507,1.0459,0.6558,2.266,4.092,2.9496,0.4655,0.3822,8.0608,6.2837,3.5272,2.3166,0.1754,5.1285,1.3406,0.9628,1.6312,1.177,6.0145,2.3462,1.3261,3.1029,1.1563,0.1929,1.8418,4.1801,1.1154,0.6259,1.9356,3.974,1.5383,5.6048,3.0655,1.1225,2.5873,8.3351,1.9797,0.0,0.0015,0.0061,2.5022,1.0959,4.2468,3.6415,1.1275,0.027,3.1649,0.0006,0.0018,0.0523,8.3936,7.7973,1.0153,0.4898,3.9558,0.9363,6.9944,3.148,1.6667,2.4165,0.0479,4.4095,1.4536,1.6576,0.0108,4.3431,0.9601,8.73,7.2288,4.8898,0.0282,3.4839,0.6688,4.6438,0.0026,0.6726,0.889,0.1146,6.9343,4.5853,0.1921,4.2599,1.4062,3.1353,2.8031,5.4791,3.2164,3.3055,0.7247,1.3027,0.0195,5.4137,2.2041,3.8766,2.7575,0.8662,1.2212,2.0688,4.0376,0.5199,1.3794,1.8266,0.1445,5.7139,0.3947,0.0855,2.5514,3.7237,0.0005,0.0011,0.003,1.1535,2.8114,2.7567,3.6063,0.2807,2.8415,4.337,1.2738,1.2411,0.6579,2.1668,2.8472,0.4718,5.7784,3.5105,1.7872,2.1716,0.4921,0.1408,6.9223,5.0363,2.5769,4.6509,6.3807,2.3368,3.5314,3.3503,0.2177,0.468,0.7058,0.6489,2.3943,4.784,4.7064,0.326,3.5806,4.4366,0.0812,2.5507,2.8436,2.9197,0.2265,4.5845,2.5079,0.872,4.0055,2.1242,0.8082,1.2623,5.8954,2.7744,1.6236,0.3517,2.0316,2.381,4.2266,0.0005,0.0023,0.0059,1.1766,1.3816,0.7554,0.1017,4.1864,4.4411,0.465,0.03,5.3216,0.2494,4.3668,5.4935,1.0899,2.4507,1.544,7.1524,4.619,1.076,2.3251,1.6511,4.3764,1.411,4.8175,0.1808,2.8657,0.5309,0.4441,0.1182,4.905,1.5291,1.5504,3.4923,3.6045,5.9225,0.0286,6.2408,3.5687,0.4966,2.6194,1.319,3.6265,3.6053,4.2475,0.0053,0.7172,2.0916,1.687,0.7722,4.5285,1.2096,0.1522,0.9698,1.9258,0.6421]}
{"prompt":"Venezuelan leftist President Nicolas Maduro said on Tuesday that terrorists had broken into a National Guard unit over the weekend and stolen weapons , the latest sign of volatility in the oil-rich country convulsed by","text":"Venezuelan leftist President Nicolas Maduro said on Tuesday that terrorists had broken into a National Guard unit over the weekend and stolen weapons, the latest sign of volatility in the oil-rich country convulsed by social and political unrest. \u201cThey invaded our camp,\u201d he said while speaking to Venezuelan state television. \u201cThey stole seven armoured vehicles.\u201d\nThe National Guard is not part of the armed forces, but a civilian unit tasked with defending Venezuela\u2019s border against armed groups like Colombia\u2019s Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). A spokesman told Reuters the weaponry was missing only a few armoured vehicles which had been confiscated earlier and not other parts of the armoured units.\nIn all, 30 members of the National Guard were killed during a crackdown on an attempted coup in eastern Venezuela on Feb. 10 and another officer on Tuesday.\nA military official told Reuters that no weapons had been taken from a unit inside the Guard, and that most of the National Guard\u2019s units inside border regions of the country were not affected by the latest incident.\nPresident Maduro on Tuesday dismissed his right-wing deputy prime minister Tareck El Aissami as his acting chief of defence after earlier reports claimed two of El Aissami\u2019s bodyguards had been arrested with alleged weapons at a checkpoint outside Caracas.\nThe head of the National Assembly, in power, Juan Guaido, a Venezuelan leader at odds with Maduro over power sharing, said on Tuesday Guaido held a meeting with the top National Guard officers over the weekend.\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, Guaido alleged that \u201cundercutting the National Guard is a way of undermining the entire social order in the country\u201d.\nVenezuela has seen mass rallies and clashes between pro- and anti-Maduro forces in recent months, and some of the violence has been exacerbated by accusations of election fraud ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election.\nSome observers say the violence might have been exacerbated because of the economic crisis in Venezuela, one of Latin America\u2019s toughest since the 1970s. The US Department of State estimates daily unemployment is at 40%, and inflation in the latest six months to May was 14,000,000% \u2014 more than 1,000 times the global average.\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has promised to investigate whether the weaponry stolen from a National Guard unit had been delivered to an army reserve unit affiliated with opposition leader Juan Guaido, his most prominent opponent.\nTwo officers of the National Guard had been arrested for two weeks with alleged weapons at a checkpoint outside Caracas, Guaido told Venezuelan newspaper Tal Cual on Monday. A military official told Reuters on Monday that the officers, with their permission, were interrogating the alleged arms seizure.","token_len":565,"entropy":[12.2028,2.2708,7.8516,4.0263,0.6235,0.0003,2.9227,1.1942,2.1531,0.5488,8.5741,1.8464,5.0154,0.2565,1.6126,6.0644,2.6539,3.9554,6.581,0.6361,0.1939,1.6031,6.0791,2.946,1.965,4.9391,1.4687,3.0385,0.542,9.7865,0.5435,0.787,5.1947,0.3313,0.6428,1.0817,13.9377,0.0529,2.1772,0.0785,6.0324,4.4217,1.3973,0.9892,0.2859,14.3492,5.5995,8.8597,6.9222,2.6753,5.9203,1.4531,13.9828,8.358,2.2651,0.3818,5.4819,2.0229,1.0451,5.4253,2.5469,0.7624,0.3418,1.8872,0.2656,0.8536,2.3817,7.0363,5.871,0.5481,2.5268,2.0903,2.0373,1.4458,12.1889,3.6144,0.0527,2.9003,4.1739,3.6224,0.0011,0.5899,2.982,0.1788,1.5492,1.1181,3.3274,4.1546,1.7226,4.383,0.1651,3.1143,2.5774,10.2109,6.2728,6.1406,3.4904,5.9126,3.1522,1.8558,4.2796,5.6654,6.6577,0.516,0.3918,2.7252,0.0404,0.0348,2.3846,0.8993,0.9703,0.3607,0.0963,1.1906,4.5189,2.91,5.0066,1.5606,1.5468,9.3449,1.0779,6.301,7.4433,2.4671,1.2306,5.0382,0.2081,5.2703,1.8635,0.2984,4.342,2.9979,4.1592,4.7919,4.8447,3.1024,0.3887,0.19,4.7323,4.5236,0.4133,0.4815,3.47,6.0656,0.1636,5.8782,4.6167,0.0365,0.2609,0.4525,0.0122,1.0201,2.2273,2.7855,2.3443,3.9198,0.7455,4.7231,4.8324,0.6625,1.2915,8.2748,0.2653,1.5086,5.3563,0.2435,3.4872,3.384,4.4324,8.4774,4.3209,2.8205,2.6953,1.1419,3.7241,3.2311,2.33,1.6943,0.6778,0.9936,5.356,2.2379,1.3569,0.0731,2.7729,0.983,3.3586,3.4527,5.4283,0.5196,2.909,2.2115,2.129,0.8276,5.792,0.3505,0.2406,6.7611,0.0508,13.9016,1.4053,0.0078,5.9193,5.1354,7.3484,3.5015,4.6461,1.6016,0.6184,0.7699,2.1815,2.9765,1.02,0.1591,4.5868,2.3255,0.1214,0.4701,5.8393,1.1067,3.6966,0.5395,3.9648,5.0785,6.4274,0.3835,0.0132,7.622,6.467,0.008,6.3417,0.1429,0.4668,0.1628,1.2395,0.1183,0.002,1.277,5.3855,6.756,2.7376,0.383,5.9069,5.6495,7.3778,5.9187,4.1477,5.9125,1.6193,3.9431,0.0104,0.0005,0.001,3.8332,0.0859,0.0095,6.5601,0.0071,0.8037,0.3895,3.6803,5.7726,4.8106,2.9888,4.8441,0.9837,1.8537,1.9583,2.5895,0.0023,0.6638,0.6943,1.7615,3.7041,0.0109,0.4334,1.4482,5.2079,1.0315,7.0818,3.9834,5.2655,6.7372,5.0252,16.0009,0.7931,5.0215,3.866,5.7849,5.7016,6.336,0.0094,1.9087,3.7011,6.5149,4.97,0.3947,1.6341,1.0902,0.7502,9.5782,0.0038,6.927,1.1409,0.8539,0.2791,1.9283,4.8565,4.325,0.4789,2.7677,4.7499,0.4609,0.459,1.5171,0.7915,3.496,0.9109,4.679,0.0025,0.6124,1.7018,1.7171,0.3118,0.8797,0.0007,5.241,0.5323,9.0378,0.3979,7.0508,8.1465,1.2091,1.9296,0.0401,2.6822,1.7084,4.1057,1.0229,3.5872,0.9799,6.285,5.549,3.566,2.8336,1.9906,0.1598,0.5378,5.7729,4.4294,0.5802,4.8648,0.0082,0.2845,1.88,2.8376,5.3441,5.0671,1.5956,4.6852,1.2185,2.2527,0.0256,2.7485,0.1082,0.003,4.6527,0.0017,1.0518,1.5127,0.2017,1.3153,1.0768,1.989,4.5202,2.3203,0.7746,2.4268,0.6738,1.4701,4.8907,0.0727,5.9673,0.78,6.9622,0.8277,8.1688,0.0096,4.293,1.3651,7.1745,0.4882,0.7535,1.7057,0.4347,0.2282,0.6901,4.9213,3.5593,1.771,1.0737,3.1043,5.1012,1.6751,1.0768,4.295,3.8557,0.8164,1.0698,6.0348,1.0329,1.9697,0.7703,1.0884,5.5564,0.2406,4.3967,0.0143,4.3769,0.2307,0.0051,6.7916,5.6336,0.4979,3.2912,0.0062,0.4024,2.8139,4.5308,4.2129,0.0009,0.5174,3.3248,8.6932,5.4197,2.0758,1.6337,4.1802,2.1547,1.3238,4.1746,3.0718,1.6055,7.4161,5.1724,0.0938,5.0949,5.0832,0.9672,4.8806,6.1817,1.4212,3.8405,5.4936,4.6936,5.3945,2.6285,0.0231,4.0453,1.9606,0.5897,1.2358,0.7028,4.4873,0.1416,0.3476,0.4055,3.4597,0.0064,1.8857,1.3415,0.5092,0.0018,2.5965,4.8762,0.4382,5.9816,3.7592,1.3924,9.405,1.4267,0.7601,2.3919,0.5638,0.009,0.1402,3.55,0.6982,4.4375,0.7674,3.6208,3.2352,4.698,1.2578,7.0741,0.2257,5.7016,2.317,5.009,1.5684,1.0338,1.4361,4.7871,7.1078,2.921,2.1714,1.1598,0.95,5.9213,5.0974,2.1168,0.2527,0.313,0.0312,4.5288,0.3757,1.3414,3.4956,7.3082,2.2267,4.5082,0.9113,0.3122,2.0892,0.469,0.1293,0.624,0.2148,0.0001,1.5864,5.1033,0.0045,1.976,5.3332,4.8624,11.3716,5.8892,4.9083,5.1668,1.4064,0.2904,3.9666,2.3905,0.7993,1.3055,0.1665,3.4685,1.7428,0.3737,1.4768,3.0914,3.8203,5.743,2.4272,7.4576,0.0599,1.1651,8.1836,0.0481,2.0531,4.3805,3.0434,8.3459,0.8246]}
{"prompt":"The Philippines said on Tuesday it has withdrawn an application for a second grant from a U.S. aid agency after getting $ 434 million in 2010 aimed at reducing poverty , but that the move","text":"The Philippines said on Tuesday it has withdrawn an application for a second grant from a U.S. aid agency after getting $ 434 million in 2010 aimed at reducing poverty, but that the move does not rule out continuing talks to find ways to access its remaining $ 9 billion in aid.\n\u201d We are not yet out of the financial aid process, \u201d Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario told a news conference with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.\nAt a time when the country is seeking to restructure its huge aid-dependent economy and tackle the problems of corruption and poor infrastructure, the move by Manila was one of the first to announce a new departure for the bilateral relationship under newly inaugurated President Rodrigo Duterte.\nDel Rosario said the government would seek to renegotiate its deal with the Agency for International Development (USAID), but pledged the Philippines would remain open to other aid agencies and said it would continue to seek assistance from the United States.\nThe Philippines last year signed a one year extension for the grant, but now the grant has expired. It is estimated that $ 9 billion of aid remains to be applied for.\n\u201cWe have to take a step like this for the country\u2019s good, because there are many things that can benefit it. Let\u2019s see if other foreign bodies can help the Philippines and find ways to use all aid given to the Philippines, \u201che said.\nThe U.S. and the Philippines agreed in February 2011 to grant $ 434 million, and the money is intended to boost government programs to support the poor. However, the Philippines has been struggling under the economic conditions imposed by the U.S. embargo on the communist-ruled island of Cuba \u2013 a program that has been extended for ten years.\nThe administration of President Obama last year renewed the Cuba aid policy and said that the fund must end in 2017.\n\u201cWhat is on the table now is the withdrawal of the application that was filed in 2010, which amounted to the issuance of the previous year\u2019s allocation for the Philippines. But we are not out of the aid process yet,\u201d Del Rosario said.\n\u201cWe are looking at all the aid that might be given to the Philippines and how we might use it. We have asked the U.S. for technical assistance on issues relating to our aid delivery process,\u201d said Minister Del Rosario.\nThe country will continue to be receptive to other international aid agencies, such as the Global Compact on Anti-Corruption, which will assist in bringing down corruption and improving investment.\n\u201cWe welcome and welcome the Global Compact\u2019s involvement with us. We have a need to address both issues,\u201d the Foreign Secretary said.","token_len":565,"entropy":[10.7571,5.6403,1.7213,1.9783,0.8578,2.8576,5.0317,4.078,3.3439,1.2614,1.5555,4.8771,7.0252,1.3051,2.8544,3.9669,0.0131,0.2237,0.6223,4.2323,1.0476,3.5581,6.9002,5.3539,11.8524,4.7344,1.5498,0.9807,7.5461,9.6726,0.0327,4.1095,1.4701,2.7191,2.6808,2.6195,1.3092,4.1319,4.7699,0.0904,7.2918,0.0193,5.5919,5.7071,3.2031,4.0938,2.9346,0.1811,6.9695,4.5738,6.4347,1.6794,5.3458,2.8933,0.7118,0.7668,0.3649,0.2578,18.4444,8.1436,7.5533,2.0393,2.9123,3.8955,6.5728,0.138,0.761,5.1886,4.8005,3.3175,1.4643,7.8975,1.4792,6.8374,2.9032,6.8239,1.3411,0.0423,0.0147,1.3943,3.0285,1.0621,0.1646,3.7518,2.3549,0.001,0.0414,0.0348,1.7743,0.0309,0.0366,0.1289,0.0071,1.1852,1.4231,7.1633,1.5741,3.7339,0.2564,1.1986,3.3994,0.8569,4.4647,0.8282,6.0824,0.0262,0.3917,6.3061,3.1095,4.8263,3.8776,0.3299,2.1919,5.8423,2.3507,4.8868,0.5744,2.7143,0.7747,4.3457,5.0474,0.1882,1.2187,3.4669,1.3988,4.1654,3.4678,4.4165,0.4225,0.6194,2.3255,2.4195,6.744,2.5488,1.4435,10.4136,2.4848,0.6272,6.3329,1.2436,6.0958,6.0285,4.1055,0.0009,0.3315,0.2068,0.0032,0.2262,0.2072,6.4585,0.0165,0.0007,1.0359,1.1707,3.1716,1.8566,3.0244,0.6448,4.169,0.0004,1.6714,3.9256,0.2499,0.3168,6.6085,0.433,0.9329,0.0038,1.358,1.8577,0.0021,1.0843,2.9874,7.2733,3.1047,1.605,0.2148,3.431,2.3524,0.1673,3.9367,2.5926,2.8186,2.8189,5.1491,1.5006,0.5176,2.0611,0.3871,2.9896,4.029,0.4915,1.2117,1.1048,0.113,0.7129,0.2107,2.041,1.7534,5.8469,1.3934,3.0675,0.6947,5.9134,4.9419,3.2424,3.1804,1.5735,3.5522,1.1689,2.0452,5.3703,2.1286,4.5288,2.3239,2.4299,0.7591,3.3039,1.6531,4.9585,0.8048,2.4248,3.2092,0.8278,1.577,2.1189,4.8708,1.9017,0.065,5.3393,1.3296,1.4971,0.3481,1.9207,6.4003,7.4504,2.0316,3.4655,3.954,1.9262,2.4629,7.617,0.5304,4.2788,0.9025,2.9948,6.0834,6.7991,8.6841,4.7874,2.1356,6.4405,3.3452,1.3736,2.1941,1.7917,0.7979,2.1946,5.5671,4.0683,1.6972,5.6431,12.5148,7.022,0.0419,3.8439,1.8902,4.6966,6.8329,6.3708,1.2279,1.3581,3.9953,1.16,2.9013,5.0117,1.1415,0.2742,4.4604,5.0446,5.4931,5.4022,0.6607,1.2394,1.4384,2.5292,2.1912,1.3252,4.2042,0.5063,0.1542,0.2083,2.0542,2.7138,0.0008,0.0352,0.1399,3.1791,1.5849,0.2735,3.0582,1.7444,3.0888,6.2275,0.3651,5.8523,0.969,2.4663,0.107,0.0399,3.523,3.6892,1.6958,4.7957,2.3775,3.3417,0.1493,5.0719,4.9312,3.9212,2.2303,3.7969,1.6397,0.9588,1.0204,3.9278,0.0319,1.1644,1.7672,1.3835,1.7801,2.8731,3.5072,1.8618,2.8698,4.7015,3.5152,0.3076,0.8223,1.8298,0.0006,0.0099,0.677,4.3343,0.8565,1.3699,5.1619,2.4549,1.4251,0.0025,2.2627,1.1954,1.9822,7.8468,1.9269,4.9359,0.7227,0.7263,2.1463,4.7471,2.1917,6.2339,0.1547,1.0045,0.3331,1.7087,4.9402,2.3407,0.7776,4.5027,3.5716,1.1853,4.8907,1.0921,5.2367,4.3177,5.1279,2.7325,2.9779,1.7482,1.5312,7.4414,4.7218,5.2324,2.3191,2.7594,0.5916,0.8639,1.8048,2.0456,4.7394,1.9124,6.1598,0.5613,0.4338,2.472,1.2247,2.4274,7.6714,0.1346,1.5713,6.1264,4.7922,1.8466,3.7181,1.6896,2.6438,1.4267,2.5406,7.453,0.0039,4.4712,8.8906,0.0274,2.7604,6.4426,3.5503,9.6003,1.7605,0.8081,6.2868,3.0021,1.1543,2.9971,1.6512,4.3124,4.4508,1.3286,0.505,1.1482,0.01,0.1005,1.942,0.116,3.4929,0.6844,1.5465,0.4956,1.6287,0.0103,0.0006,0.3016,0.2247,0.2037,1.4373,2.8223,1.1032,0.9634,3.2379,0.6776,3.011,1.3811,5.387,1.3998,5.8081,0.3435,3.8965,0.8473,0.3442,0.3401,2.2011,3.3919,1.2225,2.5117,1.665,0.5684,1.2593,1.1873,1.8843,5.3842,0.8636,1.9941,0.0013,0.0099,0.0502,2.0129,7.287,0.1106,3.8343,5.067,4.339,0.0054,3.8107,3.5116,4.9164,4.4808,1.0623,2.3,1.2025,4.3719,7.689,5.6725,2.6274,0.0011,0.3737,0.1815,2.0291,4.9628,2.6453,1.523,0.1097,3.9107,8.0433,0.1458,2.6384,2.3551,1.2282,0.5285,1.0521,4.1116,0.0017,0.463,5.9235,4.6899,2.0538,6.9992,0.0207,1.0868,0.0005,1.1306,1.7137,3.0456,4.3863,1.5139,4.648,2.3717,0.4691,1.2862,3.5359,7.531,1.6543,0.4243,1.5744,1.3931,0.9653,6.0506,4.7657,2.8315,1.0275,8.7199,0.2396,5.9016,0.187,0.7866,6.2676,3.6514,3.9496,1.4911,1.1836,2.0409,2.8743,5.7728,1.3335,3.7572,5.1533,3.1625,1.5057,0.3682,0.9859,3.2861,4.41,2.6204,0.1886,0.1108]}
{"prompt":"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday denounced football players who have protested racism by kneeling or locking arms during the playing of the national anthem before games , saying that even though their speech","text":"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday denounced football players who have protested racism by kneeling or locking arms during the playing of the national anthem before games, saying that even though their speech \"has nothing at all to do with sport -- it's not football\" their activities \"must be met with disciplinary action.\" The NFL on Tuesday said it would consult with USAG to investigate whether to implement a new policy that would bar players who take a knee from kneeling during the playing of the National Anthem. The decision came over 30 days after many American athletes including football players, and NBA players, soccer players, and tennis players showed up before games on their feet in support of racial justice, during the national anthem. On Tuesday, Sessions described that the players\u2019 \"protest has nothing at all to do with sport.\" It has nothing to do with the game. It has nothing to do with sport. But as I see it, when it comes to the anthem, the players are doing their duty by getting up and standing up. But it came to light after that they\u2019re also protesting the policies of many of our government agencies.\nNICK KIRBY, POLITICO CORRESPONDENT: He went from condemning the protesters as an act of defiance against the flag to defending them on national television and invoking the right to free speech. You will recall just a little over a month ago, on a day when the country\u2019s political discourse was focused on police brutality, President Trump issued a series of tweets condemning the players for their words and actions.\nSTEVIE WINTER, POLITICO CORRESPONDENT: But that was as president, not as Attorney General. Two months later, he is standing in the middle. Sessions said that the players who did not show up to watch the game, while praising them for \u201cdoing what\u2019s right\u201d also acknowledged \u201ctheir disappointment at the lack of support during the anthem.\u201d He continued \u201cwe understand they are disappointed in the lack of support for our officers and for the country,\u201d adding that it is important that the players \u201cunderstand that no matter how you choose to protest, whether you do it during the anthem or not, during the time of silence or not, during the pregame festivities or not, during the time of cheer or not, you will always be in our hearts and we support you.\u201d\nSESSIONS: You\u2019re never too late to be a good person, whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat, whether you\u2019re a Democrat or a Republican, no matter what your religion or no matter what your race is, and if you care about the future of your children and about your country, you\u2019ll stand with us.","token_len":566,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6125,1.638,1.4591,0.0032,3.3461,1.7961,5.6384,12.5742,1.6407,1.0546,2.4206,6.3012,4.7158,3.5457,1.8179,3.3281,8.0363,0.5385,1.1988,0.7427,7.3616,0.0107,0.7038,0.1536,0.0004,3.7602,0.5948,2.2529,1.2921,2.4376,5.9483,2.6358,4.1068,7.7576,2.9121,3.2804,2.8768,4.8114,0.1303,0.0287,0.0047,0.0129,6.2119,9.3047,1.0194,1.1437,3.3836,3.82,3.6395,7.0167,5.8912,2.1477,3.8769,0.4738,6.4764,0.1389,7.2132,0.2107,0.3744,4.5517,2.8908,4.6375,0.6233,2.2441,0.8991,1.3629,8.0387,0.1401,6.1013,7.9295,2.7099,3.1519,1.986,4.93,4.8854,1.6113,3.1429,0.4486,1.793,0.7386,3.7425,0.6023,2.6797,4.3842,2.0058,0.1917,6.2847,1.0529,0.6561,0.3518,5.5656,0.0171,0.27,3.2273,0.0043,0.5628,2.3819,3.8791,2.3435,6.5582,8.4,0.4576,0.0428,7.2045,4.8211,1.5948,5.4709,4.1317,0.6341,2.6162,5.0259,5.3602,0.2398,0.2901,12.1164,0.1613,0.9783,0.7771,3.4729,0.0452,6.7605,0.8815,5.6095,3.855,3.7,5.2112,6.344,2.2021,2.3326,0.0148,4.4896,1.6758,3.0497,4.9154,0.9268,0.8519,0.0041,0.4094,4.4758,0.88,0.2946,5.0862,5.5239,4.7831,5.4335,3.3968,15.4541,7.9072,4.5136,6.7123,1.3798,6.5073,0.2419,2.0057,0.0011,0.0028,0.0003,0.0047,0.5436,1.8285,5.3387,3.5884,0.7313,0.075,0.0027,0.0078,1.8223,4.6247,1.2857,1.1613,0.5354,0.1298,0.0621,0.0009,0.0082,4.7051,0.3593,4.6644,4.4971,3.411,5.1966,0.1269,0.223,4.1805,2.4762,0.1114,0.0923,1.9607,3.9898,0.4611,2.1006,2.0562,1.519,2.9553,2.7652,4.0723,3.3524,5.8108,3.2398,0.8484,2.0731,0.8382,1.3015,4.4726,2.9339,8.1228,2.4798,2.7389,3.9443,3.7697,5.2108,9.3764,0.454,4.4153,4.2363,1.6662,2.4048,6.0467,0.5923,5.5603,1.8721,2.3678,4.1849,1.7427,1.5342,2.9817,11.7754,4.4035,3.9063,4.1077,1.6657,1.7401,6.9148,4.6081,0.0475,0.0004,0.0001,0.0106,0.3833,5.3982,4.6536,3.8115,6.6251,1.5179,4.8619,3.4302,4.2232,3.3296,0.0502,4.1026,4.3477,1.2782,4.4565,0.802,5.6437,1.3275,3.8532,4.1808,0.3367,2.5776,10.4724,0.652,4.1984,0.6059,0.7554,0.0476,0.7189,4.0641,5.5278,2.1345,6.2572,1.5837,3.8836,2.3303,0.3384,1.4925,0.0525,0.6474,4.3981,2.9743,3.7285,0.4238,1.7364,4.6458,7.3196,1.0704,1.8742,5.1303,2.6497,0.6985,5.5565,0.2795,4.65,0.734,1.1199,5.2934,1.6354,4.6415,0.7009,3.5144,0.0009,1.2185,3.5794,1.2542,3.0685,1.6981,2.121,7.0699,1.4695,0.1502,0.5528,2.2842,6.1797,0.509,4.5977,6.4036,1.3572,0.3653,5.0945,0.2953,0.0003,0.0019,0.0007,0.0033,0.0105,3.8816,3.33,1.6679,5.6892,6.3587,1.5367,2.8544,1.1157,6.8534,0.0017,1.0213,8.2223,2.4313,2.177,0.1079,1.8712,4.036,5.0337,2.6972,1.1742,1.8349,5.4405,9.1902,2.6874,1.6771,1.8152,0.9185,3.2668,4.1685,1.4264,4.2419,0.0984,2.0634,6.1489,0.3685,2.1836,2.5605,4.7267,6.3115,2.2233,0.8331,10.8642,5.1121,4.2402,2.7344,5.6179,2.0056,1.7143,0.7696,2.7245,8.962,6.5819,8.259,6.0558,0.2562,2.3908,8.3117,3.1729,1.0588,3.4308,0.0032,3.1915,5.896,0.3173,0.962,0.442,8.9253,6.1198,3.4272,4.7873,6.2264,0.0714,6.5835,5.9928,4.5242,1.7743,3.627,2.3528,0.8315,2.4427,0.0057,0.4053,2.2231,3.3265,4.6803,1.4596,3.4091,1.5418,4.2343,1.997,4.0645,2.2536,6.8443,0.5326,3.0922,1.2316,2.2103,1.3687,1.8628,1.2923,1.8251,1.1543,5.2426,0.0225,0.8386,5.9593,1.6236,1.3157,3.8789,4.6089,0.0917,3.5821,0.6278,5.1913,1.1427,4.3856,0.5161,4.4166,0.5838,1.2048,0.3233,1.0121,0.1083,6.6712,0.7983,4.1339,0.9457,7.7246,2.3207,1.7029,0.137,4.6366,0.3891,8.5825,0.7283,4.521,1.8837,0.7319,0.098,2.4028,0.2936,1.9502,0.1385,7.6727,2.0394,0.1674,0.0823,2.4538,2.6099,2.7822,0.8905,4.0573,2.4508,4.2295,1.4025,2.58,6.0408,0.6166,1.6297,4.8435,0.8126,0.5075,3.5185,5.0988,0.0425,0.626,3.6653,7.1097,1.9612,1.4773,7.1509,6.7472,3.2648,0.7909,3.4858,1.7325,3.561,3.4509,1.9881,5.0807,0.5952,3.781,0.2644,0.9875,1.3891,4.1776,0.3101,0.887,0.0645,1.3428,2.5616,0.1127,0.594,0.0162,0.2346,0.3544,2.9429,0.1471,0.4025,0.0371,0.7178,5.7321,0.011,1.1744,1.1935,5.2262,1.119,6.9048,0.05,0.3942,0.2749,2.2592,3.7141,0.5313,3.1403,3.2028,0.2226,5.6532,0.1962,1.3769,3.291,0.1566,2.9717,3.5893,1.762,5.6302,1.4154,1.1243,0.5244,1.3201,1.858,0.1008,1.6015,1.7636,2.1493,1.3884,0.9784]}
{"prompt":"Thousands of protesters in Muslim-majority countries in Asia rallied on Friday to condemn the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital , as authorities tightened security outside U.S. embassies . Leaders in Indonesia","text":"Thousands of protesters in Muslim-majority countries in Asia rallied on Friday to condemn the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, as authorities tightened security outside U.S. embassies. Leaders in Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, and Turkey all condemned the move as a violation of international law, saying it would create tensions in their countries. President Rodrigo Duterte, who earlier this week called the annexation a \u201cterrible mistake,\u201c said Friday he considered suspending trade with the U.S. because of the move. In a rare public appearance, Malaysia Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said Friday that the decision was a \u201chistoric mistake.\u201d Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan called Friday for an immediate U.N. Security Council resolution urging Israel to withdraw from the city, which the U.S. wants to recognize as Israel s capital. \u201cJerusalem is an international issue,\u201d Khan told a press conference after attending a prayer meeting in Islamabad. \u201cInternational law says that Israel cannot lay their hands on it. \u201c He said Islamabad was \u201ccloser than ever to China\u201d and had been trying to make China play a bigger role in the region. India also said Friday the annexation was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d because of its religious and legal ramifications. Several hundred protesters held a rally in Hong Kong s Causeway Bay to oppose the move. \u201cJerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian people and we believe Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people and we shall see it united as such with its two capitals, Palestine and Israel,\u201d said demonstrator Joshua Wong, 22, who holds the title of a Hong Kong leader and has been jailed for his opposition to China. \u201cJerusalem, the capital of Israel, is for the Jews. The Jews have built it, the Arabs have been living there, the Palestinians are going to live there in the next, in the next thousand years. We believe that. \u201c Many anti-Israel demonstrations have also taken place in Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Algeria. Turkey s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, criticized the move, saying Friday that \u201cthere is no more Israel.\u201d \u201cIn the long term it won t help the peace process,\u201d Erdogan said on Turkey s main news channel.

Mr. Iwakura will present himself as a party of moderates focused on realism and competence. The DPJ is widely expected to become the first of the three main political parties to hold the majority in the Diet, as the Liberal Democratic Party suffers a serious defeat.Mr. Iwakura says he has no problem accepting the opposition s criticism of his party as a tool of the rich and powerful. The DPJ is the main beneficiary of a powerful lobby whose activities Mr. Iwakura says have helped to make Japan one of the country s weakest allies when it comes to dealing with political and diplomatic disputes with other countries.The DPJ is unlikely to win the confidence vote over opposition calls for an independent inquiry into the scandal surrounding former premier and prime minister Junichiro Koizumi s sacking. The scandal led to the ousting of three former prime ministers and forced Koizumi to resign as chairman of the ruling party.Mr. Iwakura says other opposition parties will be too weak to put forward any serious proposals and he has no intention of voting for his government at a later confidence vote. If the government won t get the two-thirds mark needed for approval, it would be forced to dissolve this week to find enough support in the Diet ( national parliament ) to form a new government.If Mr. Iwakura were to win the confidence vote, he could put off the next election, scheduled for April of next year. But many speculate he might run against Mr. Iwakura s vice president and candidate for the next leadership position in the party, Koichi Hagiuda, a retired general.Mr. Hagiuda says he will take on the conservative media and opposition parties, and has urged his party to move away from President Barack Obama s position on the nuclear issue that has pushed Japan into a deep diplomatic crisis with its two big neighbors and the White House. The Liberal Democratic Party s decision to return to U.S. President-elect Barack Obama s policy position on Japan s nuclear issues led to an embarrassing diplomatic row between Japan and Washington, and has given Mr. Iwakura, who has pledged to win tough diplomatic battles, a perfect platform to attract support from voters worried about the nuclear issue while also getting them to support the government s economic plans.","token_len":566,"entropy":[8.203,0.5154,0.7924,5.4862,10.5606,3.2369,0.3648,1.7582,5.1587,1.2029,5.1387,9.3074,3.4308,2.8017,0.236,6.5895,1.3921,4.6296,3.0383,4.6279,0.5292,7.2462,3.2072,2.1437,4.6458,5.4963,6.1459,4.3493,3.0503,3.6382,0.7125,7.8599,3.279,0.0017,0.5035,0.002,11.3358,5.8815,3.4743,0.5087,0.0082,5.7183,0.2563,0.4265,8.3436,5.479,9.0452,3.7096,6.5092,5.2179,2.1938,0.8974,4.1389,1.4121,0.2393,0.8661,4.2588,3.8209,0.0054,3.1997,0.0078,8.3243,1.7313,5.8262,0.9083,1.0089,6.3952,1.2618,3.2502,1.2432,0.8549,6.2554,1.3784,3.31,0.3604,4.5864,1.3756,0.3175,2.647,0.6698,1.4387,3.8044,0.3123,3.7609,1.8692,1.4623,0.9909,10.1718,1.853,3.9149,8.8086,2.1053,0.1002,5.8344,3.5146,4.4866,1.4348,3.9128,3.6822,6.3845,2.4235,0.0766,1.392,3.9355,0.0563,1.8009,2.3634,0.0004,5.8661,1.5103,3.7745,1.0293,4.9522,0.0011,7.0062,4.6236,5.1684,6.5304,2.5014,0.5576,0.6784,6.0519,3.1358,6.5355,6.4248,0.0263,10.9781,1.0231,7.8188,1.0928,3.5786,9.8213,1.9681,2.1595,4.6567,1.136,0.0067,4.1794,0.7194,2.2456,4.1609,1.0674,2.8841,2.2902,2.8449,0.0761,0.3764,3.0752,1.9467,4.4324,0.997,0.8063,2.8717,1.7451,3.6908,2.3232,4.5825,0.2996,0.0684,8.6053,1.3052,4.8935,2.4099,2.3554,3.0203,0.0008,0.1813,0.0062,4.5626,0.8324,2.4501,2.6432,4.4081,4.3238,1.3715,5.522,8.8887,6.4346,1.3456,0.3584,2.4775,4.0972,1.7681,6.0789,0.8949,2.2682,6.4375,1.4235,0.7255,0.8712,3.4114,1.9549,0.0052,1.8143,3.3918,4.0413,4.6808,0.0559,2.1051,5.8857,4.2648,6.9295,4.6207,7.1228,0.0007,0.1043,0.0054,2.0243,2.2468,2.7015,2.1338,3.8914,2.4534,3.2331,0.0287,0.0724,5.427,1.7821,6.5532,6.1758,6.8936,0.3881,0.0113,0.0067,3.9557,0.0059,4.3145,2.8815,5.3628,2.6256,3.9593,2.535,1.0677,0.4639,2.0967,1.8291,0.0063,1.7535,5.5995,0.0107,2.096,1.7523,4.1613,5.1407,5.5125,4.4253,8.395,1.0889,3.1232,2.9365,4.4091,0.3433,0.9138,4.8121,5.1096,4.034,2.7427,3.155,2.6495,0.0061,3.2267,0.0985,0.0055,0.0604,0.0133,0.0004,3.2749,6.8446,7.1169,1.3725,2.0091,2.9724,3.5328,0.1516,1.3233,4.1576,1.6865,0.0654,6.0587,2.6851,1.9976,0.0387,1.5182,3.9762,2.2784,0.001,0.0009,0.5825,0.6041,2.969,4.3537,0.0885,0.3673,2.9346,2.4797,0.9054,2.2336,0.0006,0.4618,0.0055,1.5372,7.8276,4.3275,0.5687,2.5087,2.1423,6.4014,1.6936,0.452,5.447,2.8699,2.9634,2.6325,1.65,3.4612,2.3319,2.7529,1.298,1.5588,0.1033,4.5065,0.9032,4.3555,5.1123,4.3174,3.4258,2.3065,14.6124,0.4585,0.3272,5.662,1.5451,2.7343,6.1616,4.3921,6.8213,2.0769,5.08,0.918,0.0398,6.9172,4.4227,2.2103,2.9706,0.5633,1.4814,0.7382,1.4926,5.1581,0.1477,4.7835,7.4664,2.7404,3.9041,6.3414,7.1888,2.0221,2.6375,0.528,1.9879,7.7421,13.3816,3.6811,1.5752,0.651,2.3286,0.2547,1.3639,0.3408,0.2759,4.0974,2.6732,0.0011,0.3915,0.0094,3.8934,0.3115,1.488,0.5899,1.0707,0.0288,0.5188,0.719,2.5874,4.8783,4.486,1.9249,3.606,2.067,2.7136,6.4462,0.1154,3.0089,6.5433,0.6628,0.0049,0.9326,3.3322,5.2742,8.4973,1.9558,2.3143,4.3475,3.0322,2.7319,0.0055,4.0919,0.0144,5.353,8.3536,1.4202,2.8675,6.7304,2.0971,1.0675,2.7969,3.2829,4.1369,2.9054,0.9297,1.7896,1.7059,3.8952,2.5489,4.8772,5.8046,11.0948,1.0089,2.3424,3.195,4.0816,1.4029,2.2947,0.0014,0.3906,0.001,0.0086,3.3004,0.741,2.4509,4.4292,2.4039,1.3794,5.9066,8.0488,2.8156,3.9228,1.6755,2.6872,2.3436,3.5702,4.9136,2.439,1.1055,0.5078,5.345,2.6932,0.0015,8.3643,5.9037,0.0044,0.6063,4.8529,1.4085,2.0703,3.1463,0.5303,5.0866,1.2283,5.9836,1.0771,1.9246,1.5619,3.7686,8.1662,0.6219,1.3194,2.993,3.7827,6.7992,0.9087,3.2861,2.6871,6.9933,0.0184,0.4175,3.4747,5.5859,0.2924,0.0536,6.3695,5.99,0.3476,6.9181,0.237,6.1876,0.0016,0.0447,0.2434,3.2541,4.2476,0.0074,2.5063,0.0065,1.551,3.1173,3.7713,1.4365,5.8381,1.4963,0.4126,3.8102,5.9809,0.5227,3.0114,3.2645,4.4313,1.2192,1.5852,2.2171,0.0644,2.6756,1.4446,1.6746,2.8278,4.7038,1.7582,0.0009,1.0868,0.0054,4.1489,0.9146,1.4179,5.8421,0.1436,6.2336,9.0905,6.0512,3.9765,2.0513,1.1741,7.5694,3.2226,0.6554,7.3137,1.9217,0.9546,4.5498,6.3426,0.1974,1.6697,5.9132,0.5577,6.7296,2.1822,4.8805,4.5453,0.466,2.3249,2.2406,2.785,1.7348,5.5973,3.5215,0.4248]}
{"prompt":"A U.S. congressional panel this week asked 22 government agencies to share documents on Moscow-based cyber firm Kaspersky Lab , saying its products could be used to carry out \u201c nefarious activities against the United","text":"A U.S. congressional panel this week asked 22 government agencies to share documents on Moscow-based cyber firm Kaspersky Lab, saying its products could be used to carry out \u201c nefarious activities against the United States,\u201d according to a congressional report.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Federal Bureau of Investigation were among agencies that must provide such documents, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters. Two other agency officials, who spoke on Tuesday on condition of anonymity, said they were not yet being compelled to provide documents on what they had on Kaspersky Lab but that they would soon have to.\nSince the firm\u2019s alleged ties to Russia, including an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015, U.S. security agencies have been investigating whether Kaspersky had attempted to infiltrate computer networks that could be used by U.S. adversaries. At one point, U.S. officials linked Kaspersky\u2019s activities with Russia\u2019s hacking campaign against Western companies in the 2016 election, but they removed the association in an ODNI report in October.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is also examining an alleged plot to compromise sensitive data belonging to the U.S. Treasury Department via the \u201cWannaCry\u201d ransomware used against critical Internet infrastructure worldwide in May.\nKaspersky lab has denied any wrongdoing, saying that it has always complied strictly with the laws of the countries in which it operates, and that it takes the fight against terrorism very seriously.\n\u201cThe U.S. Government\u2019s repeated efforts to stigmatize Kaspersky Lab for non-terrorist related issues is highly disturbing and unacceptable,\u201d the U.S. company said.\nSince Kaspersky Lab was set up as a private company in 1996, the U.S. Government has regularly paid it between $500 million and $1 billion a year to do contract research and consulting work, and used its products in the U.S. Government\u2019s cyberspace protection programs.\nKaspersky\u2019s contract research at an NSA building in Washington was reviewed by lawmakers for decades, and one of its former employees has told Reuters that the NSA told Kaspersky that its products, including the anti-virus software, were \u201c100%\u201d legal.\nIn

{"prompt":"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify before the House Judiciary Committee about issues facing the Justice Department on Nov. 14 , the committee confirmed on Tuesday . The hearing will take place at 10","text":"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify before the House Judiciary Committee about issues facing the Justice Department on Nov. 14, the committee confirmed on Tuesday. The hearing will take place at 10 a.m.\nSessions, along with Special Counsel Robert Mueller and FBI Director James Comey, testified before the Judiciary Committee last week in a marathon seven-hour hearing. The special counsel\u2019s testimony drew sharp scrutiny over his handling of Russian interference in the 2016 election, as well as whether his investigation into alleged collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials is a witch hunt and a political act.\nThis time, the hearing will focus on the FBI\u2019s \u201ccounterintelligence unit,\u201d which has been criticized over multiple scandals. Members of Congress have said that the special counsel\u2019s investigations into Russian election meddling, in particular, should be separated from his counterintelligence unit as being separate entities. Mueller called on Sessions to step aside as an FBI director in September, saying he was unaware of some of the activities by his top agents.\nIn his testimony, Sessions laid out the Department of Justice\u2019s response to the FBI\u2019s use of the controversial FISA court to target political opposition. He also discussed the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to tackle Russian cyber warfare and whether the White House will be allowed to participate in the Russia investigation as a fifth-party cooperator. Sessions will also be asked whether he has considered firing Comey for his role in the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\u201cIn the future, the attorney general will continue to take the lead on matters of national security,\u201d said Republican Representative Tom Cotton, a key member of the Judiciary Committee. \u201cThis testimony will be an important part of how Congress works with the attorney general. Congress is uniquely situated to help ensure the attorney general\u2019s ability to lead the DOJ in the days and months ahead.\u201d\nIn his testimony, Sessions laid out the Department of Justice\u2019s response to the FBI\u2019s use of the controversial FISA court\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned with the manner in which the FBI determined which foreign governments, entities and people to target,\u201d he said in his written testimony, citing the FBI\u2019s \u201cfailure to identify politically connected individuals\u201d in the Trump campaign. \u201cWe are taking a number of steps to ensure the FBI takes careful and reasoned steps when identifying foreign targets and avoid politically motivated prosecutions and arrests of Americans.\u201d\nThe chairman of the Judiciary

{"prompt":"The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Thursday to clear a procedural path forward for a Republican tax bill , which was still being written and was expected to be unveiled next week as President","text":"The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Thursday to clear a procedural path forward for a Republican tax bill, which was still being written and was expected to be unveiled next week as President Donald Trump\u2019s legislative legacy. The House passed the bill, 328-167, after a marathon 5 1\/2-hour vote in which conservative lawmakers argued for their support, and after the opposition Democrat-led caucus called for the measure to be scrapped. On Thursday, the House voted on whether to pass the bill on a party-line vote, with Republican representatives saying they would vote to accept it anyway. The legislation included a corporate tax rate cut for companies that pay very minimal taxes, tax cuts and incentives for individuals, and a repeal of the nation\u2019s tax-free market in securities, known as the \u201cstock option loophole.\u201d The House\u2019s action is required as a formal condition of Republican support for Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, but does not guarantee passage. The U.S. is facing a huge drop in the value of stocks and could be in a deep recession, economists say. The stock market slumped Thursday by about 1.8 percent, after a record low was set on Wednesday. The House is in session all week, ending Saturday. \u2014 Toshio Igawa Associated Press writers Tania Cheng and Elizabeth McCombs contributed to this report.

I want to go there and talk to people about some of their experience with this disease \u2014 which is something we will do this weekend and this next week,\u201d he said.\nGhebreyesus said the international team would ask for people to be interviewed who may have interacted with the virus, either in the hospitals or outside.","token_len":567,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2998,0.4341,0.0098,2.7746,2.2491,2.1202,0.1403,8.7808,1.8141,4.7557,6.5493,7.0253,1.219,1.8235,4.9976,4.1483,1.1639,1.9591,2.1532,3.589,6.3148,1.495,4.3189,2.1303,4.2155,0.6363,0.0656,1.0062,2.4073,3.4399,0.2488,6.2507,4.7828,0.8715,0.0086,14.6022,9.9707,1.5872,4.5689,6.8581,2.9079,2.5932,1.3564,1.8154,0.755,1.0475,2.7045,9.7843,0.3158,5.9093,0.1981,3.0977,1.655,5.0559,6.0288,5.6231,0.0026,0.0151,0.1099,0.1934,1.403,2.615,2.9673,5.9264,1.8286,4.8878,2.8326,5.8035,2.882,2.2447,2.0354,4.6122,2.0925,5.539,7.8581,3.2349,0.9753,4.5142,4.8573,0.4876,2.3554,3.7411,0.3858,0.4714,4.8736,0.4656,5.0691,1.2157,0.3639,1.4741,1.0187,1.9705,3.3128,4.9602,0.1313,3.2585,0.4032,0.6204,3.8407,0.9353,2.3401,0.0832,0.0056,0.063,1.3056,2.2417,3.9991,4.5688,4.1932,0.8097,0.9635,1.9553,1.8284,6.32,1.3549,5.7905,0.4169,1.6023,3.9771,6.3432,0.969,6.5267,0.2916,2.2837,1.8395,2.0367,2.7692,1.3648,2.4655,6.9421,10.4202,1.1509,1.0762,5.2921,1.8633,5.5426,5.4662,0.6389,4.0717,4.0681,2.4715,1.2853,3.6609,0.1029,0.8057,5.9449,9.1683,0.7007,0.1131,2.5436,3.177,3.1723,7.5559,4.5122,10.4674,1.9697,5.7592,0.0853,0.3535,9.7938,6.4672,8.293,3.2558,5.2742,0.2466,6.0667,8.1635,1.3755,1.7392,8.0276,0.5823,0.5177,5.4479,2.9673,7.7926,3.5809,1.9988,5.4446,6.2229,0.5911,7.4618,2.134,0.615,5.8042,1.808,0.0436,0.002,0.3135,2.6599,1.6148,2.0973,5.7611,0.1126,4.1758,2.0295,0.653,1.6798,4.9398,0.0004,0.0041,0.0025,6.1672,4.4913,0.8635,5.4618,6.3808,0.0542,1.952,2.2773,0.0063,4.6051,1.5815,6.1614,2.2333,2.4487,1.3667,4.4097,0.0986,1.9432,5.6845,1.0364,0.4057,1.6787,2.2021,0.0929,5.8741,4.7963,5.4394,3.1249,1.9667,1.078,2.5587,0.5361,0.96,3.0734,2.6077,3.2525,1.1641,4.3132,0.868,2.4299,2.2915,0.6658,1.4583,4.1516,3.4972,4.7459,1.7843,6.5459,0.5109,0.822,5.9469,5.8807,0.9255,6.0524,11.453,1.7518,8.574,1.3382,8.802,0.0058,5.7638,6.3722,2.6314,8.6948,0.894,5.4389,6.4061,4.328,0.1661,0.0905,0.003,0.0646,0.0932,10.2483,1.5933,3.9227,2.2408,2.7152,6.6411,4.7258,2.338,4.4208,2.2965,1.7506,2.178,10.1734,6.7021,4.1743,4.8611,2.7518,0.0362,0.1788,2.3085,2.5047,2.0564,1.7213,4.937,1.1715,2.1043,0.9297,3.3978,0.976,6.9174,10.4457,0.2374,0.0445,1.2179,2.9984,1.0641,1.6583,2.1212,7.6509,0.6686,0.0159,3.6314,2.3027,0.0013,0.8315,8.3434,7.9016,6.2554,5.2986,5.4824,8.441,4.5056,2.3363,4.6447,5.737,7.9525,0.2897,3.8148,1.5224,3.3165,2.2953,3.3733,2.0197,2.9103,7.8147,0.095,0.0011,2.444,0.5253,5.0494,3.2203,2.8934,6.3668,1.376,2.8182,4.2743,3.9191,4.9498,4.3719,3.8648,4.0453,4.798,3.5203,0.0884,0.0027,0.002,0.0039,0.0025,0.671,1.8071,7.8117,2.1349,0.6906,5.0757,5.2359,4.2315,0.1863,5.1624,7.849,4.8896,2.1786,3.3292,4.3633,2.668,0.0943,0.3858,0.0959,1.9567,3.7697,3.1386,0.8979,0.0024,4.8875,0.9358,0.001,1.4936,0.7335,4.8133,1.3467,5.3411,3.8921,3.321,7.8778,0.0067,0.5331,2.7367,4.9919,0.2634,0.6055,1.0524,0.6871,1.9179,3.4346,2.031,0.1592,7.6409,1.3947,4.9019,1.5952,1.3661,0.1565,6.4666,1.4898,4.5467,3.4151,0.5134,7.3829,0.1671,1.4593,4.6021,0.4332,0.7918,0.4287,1.6955,1.3959,2.047,1.3542,2.1081,4.9796,2.8883,5.1443,3.7132,0.9958,1.4588,4.4635,0.6574,4.1943,2.646,3.0383,1.1033,1.7036,1.3774,2.0278,5.7147,2.1953,0.4281,5.0112,2.5899,4.1303,5.2565,6.3583,3.7263,4.9124,7.0203,4.3703,5.6463,6.5124,0.2958,1.9667,0.8697,2.6698,2.1926,4.1282,0.415,0.9275,0.2447,0.3613,1.8641,0.9612,5.2714,2.7575,4.4172,2.9409,0.0146,2.5326,1.5509,5.4119,2.1654,3.9885,2.0645,0.7312,3.3232,3.3376,2.6142,5.9807,1.3585,3.2203,1.4932,2.2477,2.3857,2.8436,0.1416,5.6156,3.599,1.4289,2.9035,0.4577,2.6743,2.2892,5.986,0.3854,2.6007,3.7809,2.6793,1.2217,1.2883,6.5186,4.6466,0.9871,4.2358,1.7596,2.9049,3.4142,4.8632,2.7664,2.2041,2.6242,4.5797,0.515,2.3035,1.0737,2.1768,3.233,0.2899,0.1742,0.3289,3.9954,0.0566,0.0028,0.0013,0.0031,0.002,0.7936,0.9772,5.7442,2.1468,1.5017,5.2002,2.0629,5.8661,0.6783,2.9967,3.3185,6.9944,3.0064,0.233,5.9887,0.0573,0.6809,2.4415,2.3255,6.5193,1.7777,1.849,5.369,0.3468,2.8576,1.9593]}

The meeting, coming a week after Trump fired Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and days after Republicans agreed to allow Democrats to push a $700 billion national defense bill ahead of the November election, will be the first face-to-face meeting since Trump became president.\nLost in cyberspace\u2014somewhere between the dark and the deep blue seas\u2014is the Pacific Ocean. The world\u2019s water body that is second in volume and third in breadth to the Atlantic Ocean, it is one of the longest bodies of water in the world, stretching 5,000 miles from the equator far into the North and South Pacific, from Alaska to Chile. The Pacific is also home to the largest number of coral reefs and marine species in the world. It is a hotbed of marine and ocean research \u2013 an incubator for scientific discoveries and technologies that power new industries. The ocean is the planet\u2019s nursery and natural resource. The world\u2019s waterways are not connected and trade in it is important for the world economy. The amount of marine-related greenhouse gas emissions released into the ocean is estimated to surpass those released into the atmosphere annually in the year 2015\nA recent study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, suggests that the Pacific Ocean may be losing out on the largest sea ice extent it\u2019s had in over 30 years, according to the Los Angeles Times. The study looked back over satellite images to establish when the sea ice disappeared, which showed the dramatic loss occurred before the end of 2010. Scientists at NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center were unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the loss, with each group claiming one solution, and the cause remains a mystery. The study found that the Arctic had a record sea ice extent in October 2015 and a record sea ice extent in October 2016. In the year 2015 sea ice loss was greater than the average loss over the past five years. Sea ice extent loss has accelerated in recent years. The latest reports were released after the report by NASA found that 2017 was the third warmest year on record, based on global satellite measurements.\nResearchers have made great progress recently in understanding how climate warming will impact the Pacific Ocean. Studies have indicated that sea surface temperatures (SSTs) will have a massive impact on currents off the northern mid-Atlantic coast, which in turn will cause climate change impacting many nations around the world. Rising sea surface temperatures will disrupt various marine ecosystems such as coral reefs and coral reefs by raising sea surface temperatures. While rising temperatures can lead to more frequent and severe hurricanes, coral bleaching is a byproduct of rising temperatures.","token_len":567,"entropy":[7.5025,2.654,2.7144,4.1801,3.2495,1.8157,1.2662,2.9161,5.5271,3.0422,0.9272,0.7995,2.5533,1.5457,0.0091,0.2866,1.9115,0.2383,3.1219,3.0782,6.8612,1.7532,2.4149,0.6672,12.1753,0.0527,0.7914,5.0822,1.3194,2.3029,1.2673,5.6548,0.0429,5.5029,0.9729,1.291,1.0491,4.084,2.0475,1.7937,6.7832,4.0799,2.0917,0.5763,0.7535,4.4064,7.1151,0.0017,0.1291,10.6946,0.0101,0.0066,2.8137,8.9077,0.6814,3.9224,5.7268,0.1141,3.8129,3.7548,0.2258,4.4708,3.043,3.4403,4.5489,0.0702,5.6002,2.3575,2.1592,5.9572,0.0382,0.9143,2.4558,0.7921,0.0675,2.9049,1.2265,1.283,0.3463,6.8755,0.0145,0.0209,0.0003,0.0014,0.6225,2.1123,0.9622,4.0464,0.5281,0.7073,0.3081,25.68,0.4803,13.1466,0.0015,0.0069,7.1545,6.5201,2.1337,1.2685,1.0733,1.5474,7.5407,1.9487,1.4297,6.934,5.6981,6.3446,0.7012,0.6393,1.0423,9.0068,1.8559,1.0011,2.0199,4.3161,14.4782,8.408,1.1878,5.6922,6.1093,5.6424,2.7114,9.4066,3.9603,3.6357,2.7331,2.9141,0.1554,5.0432,1.3609,0.4078,2.4099,1.4378,0.7205,1.6623,1.0004,3.2183,0.0387,0.1867,5.6698,6.7091,1.4878,0.2336,0.7031,0.1004,0.2928,1.4536,3.6856,5.7075,0.9363,1.077,0.3773,1.8391,1.036,3.1285,0.0042,9.1725,1.9439,0.1013,4.4054,4.3529,1.6514,0.9741,2.2842,4.2622,3.958,0.4842,4.3956,0.5556,2.1504,1.8624,1.3938,2.9456,0.6357,0.0047,1.6934,1.2329,2.0538,0.0029,3.7212,0.3572,2.2114,4.0341,4.057,1.5877,0.083,0.1558,0.9533,3.1676,0.6987,3.1818,4.8642,0.1885,0.337,4.8657,4.435,2.7675,4.6186,9.5443,3.9107,8.4354,0.0297,0.8793,4.3496,1.6381,1.5989,5.0814,0.899,6.8406,4.8221,1.9064,1.5718,2.4918,2.9726,0.8454,2.6357,4.6709,3.4574,0.2696,0.4591,8.8712,2.9733,6.4607,2.9912,1.5321,2.3075,3.1273,1.4504,0.0371,0.0013,6.9076,0.7992,4.7578,5.0469,4.0181,7.7308,3.0878,5.5648,0.7546,6.302,1.5474,2.1729,3.3239,1.9344,0.7331,2.0351,6.9439,0.0537,5.2124,5.361,2.9186,4.1998,0.9433,0.0969,6.0134,1.8246,0.0361,3.1376,1.9606,2.2476,0.4491,6.9767,4.648,3.8036,1.4709,0.1705,0.2388,4.8006,4.1834,0.7791,3.5298,4.6312,7.4924,7.229,4.0605,1.2061,3.7798,1.1588,0.289,0.6633,0.4479,4.1599,0.0268,0.1246,3.5662,0.2442,1.3111,3.241,0.849,2.7121,0.9037,4.5153,4.2621,0.8113,1.9247,5.5081,4.4066,1.7763,2.1637,4.9254,14.1604,0.1818,0.0072,4.8517,1.1195,3.8509,3.6936,0.1827,1.8465,4.5397,0.0018,1.4653,5.1826,0.0241,0.0492,0.3153,1.6751,1.4202,3.9544,6.1498,3.2863,8.3886,2.9498,3.5326,6.2556,5.4088,1.069,2.1838,0.0474,4.8213,1.6265,3.2831,4.6413,2.1334,6.7378,3.3905,4.5029,4.706,0.9863,1.556,0.0015,5.3093,0.4984,3.7575,3.7396,1.994,1.7919,1.0275,1.2131,4.5253,0.0278,0.0027,0.0017,0.0048,4.264,3.7737,0.0041,3.5915,1.1827,0.6275,1.5698,0.3553,0.1595,2.385,1.0023,5.0481,5.5089,4.6425,3.0602,5.5481,7.1432,2.7246,2.677,1.697,5.0339,4.0308,1.7486,0.1404,0.1965,2.0258,1.9596,2.8334,0.3851,1.2473,5.146,4.4438,2.7586,3.8077,5.593,0.1025,1.2231,2.4901,5.5498,2.0191,3.0449,3.2154,1.0925,2.2983,0.2463,0.7019,0.3433,2.5322,0.3324,0.8446,3.6165,1.8332,4.0692,1.9911,5.8723,0.0362,4.0782,1.1967,5.1995,0.304,1.2847,2.6655,2.8631,3.1408,0.6912,2.7652,3.5331,0.3143,1.167,3.6688,0.0564,1.9641,6.6345,2.8018,4.8116,1.5931,0.624,0.3325,1.9864,1.8617,4.7721,6.7174,5.1168,1.5867,4.4849,1.5921,5.9477,2.6933,2.5676,4.844,0.5798,6.8613,1.9534,0.2238,4.6999,3.4801,0.0036,0.3178,0.4136,0.0013,1.8009,6.7427,0.0576,4.2251,3.424,2.4787,0.7663,1.9591,5.3449,2.839,5.2674,4.112,1.0315,5.5068,0.8773,1.7293,1.3441,2.6251,6.269,3.6402,1.7513,0.8355,2.2092,0.8871,0.7106,6.6839,1.0115,3.9003,0.1687,3.4313,3.0608,0.2731,5.7337,2.0267,0.003,0.3384,0.1254,1.8885,4.2078,2.4743,5.1686,0.5021,0.1401,6.5636,6.9673,0.2749,4.0983,7.3716,0.7071,0.6175,1.679,1.5338,2.2418,3.7251,0.0827,0.5664,3.0071,6.4249,0.1963,7.7778,4.9378,6.4334,2.8283,0.0026,0.3806,0.2018,7.2115,1.0644,2.2501,0.0445,1.5432,5.3099,7.4149,2.7188,1.2635,3.4882,0.0033,1.313,0.1779,0.903,2.6829,1.0759,6.2624,4.2643,2.2779,2.8147,0.1185,1.2481,4.5701,4.7197,2.139,3.2628,3.6904,0.0136,2.6597,3.2485,1.7244,2.2724,4.2944,0.8754,5.5023,4.1295,0.0037,2.6027,1.7349,5.848,0.7865,0.049,2.4548,1.5819,1.113]}

France, as part of the European Union, imposed a naval blockade against Damascus over the crisis in Syria's Idlib on 20 June.\nThe blockade has seen the number of migrants reaching Europe rise dramatically in recent days, though some migrants are able to cross over and reach Greek islands or Turkey.\nThe EU has demanded that Damascus stop using chemical weapons and remove the weapons from its vicinity. This was after Paris and Washington bombed a Syrian military airbase last month with a chemical weapons attack.\nThe bomb strikes on the Syrian military airbase in Syria on the night of 25 June that killed dozens of civilians included nerve agent sarin. Damascus has denied being behind the attack.\nFrench officials have said the bombings were carried out to deter the regime from using chemical weapons again.","token_len":568,"entropy":[7.6511,4.3085,0.0027,3.0306,1.7284,2.3732,0.6253,9.6991,0.3679,0.0306,0.001,2.204,2.8815,5.2574,0.5225,7.7606,0.3629,4.3765,1.9701,0.0407,1.525,5.5169,6.0972,5.894,0.095,8.326,4.1692,3.1889,6.0373,1.9226,2.2133,1.4934,3.1029,4.4561,0.1282,3.706,4.2898,3.1791,0.5223,0.1272,24.1284,1.8252,4.8409,1.4138,0.4843,3.1629,0.9057,0.0075,0.1104,1.2451,0.1744,1.6509,0.0031,0.5522,0.846,5.0311,5.8406,5.7001,2.6913,4.0479,3.8082,4.0049,3.151,3.2164,0.0949,3.3121,1.1356,1.7446,0.2063,0.3362,5.8321,3.4568,0.4511,4.7745,0.1086,5.0603,0.2602,3.9826,0.4453,1.8582,0.2721,16.3968,1.5956,4.0516,3.7917,2.2635,3.9423,0.0959,4.2549,1.7164,2.8355,8.6715,3.3066,2.7926,9.7573,5.5498,0.1479,3.3934,4.3295,2.0987,0.397,2.0263,2.0375,2.728,3.2327,3.0876,4.8061,1.3643,4.0253,4.5301,1.2383,1.2208,2.3779,1.9536,7.6186,3.8712,5.2051,1.5607,6.043,0.3156,1.2288,0.9456,0.9404,0.2062,1.7261,1.3018,0.2382,2.4311,2.176,5.7698,0.6844,3.8537,1.1383,1.3678,6.5012,0.057,0.7661,1.3506,4.5194,1.2902,1.0918,0.1553,3.6604,2.5222,2.0023,2.301,0.1278,2.4268,2.8166,1.8373,0.4124,4.2248,4.1217,5.9693,2.3956,3.4935,2.6356,4.8387,3.0017,2.7107,0.2883,1.7048,6.4668,0.6578,6.9256,0.7131,1.8143,4.0914,4.8672,0.9347,2.2235,0.8837,3.4643,1.7134,5.7531,5.5737,0.8227,5.2952,1.5993,0.1618,2.4585,5.7911,1.6828,0.126,2.5982,0.6493,0.8989,2.1579,0.6466,0.0013,4.9251,0.0326,0.0015,0.0131,1.5814,6.7719,4.6915,5.6153,0.0009,3.6572,5.8144,4.2003,3.2929,4.671,6.3227,0.2274,2.8348,6.937,1.492,4.9336,4.1808,1.9435,0.7048,5.0996,1.8272,2.3044,4.8399,2.7156,0.3901,0.8226,1.9189,1.7576,0.3651,3.1236,0.7,0.9238,0.0074,6.1671,1.6979,1.8959,0.4051,3.8775,7.1109,5.9562,0.2045,4.1374,2.546,1.6429,0.7444,0.0305,4.9481,3.7819,0.1308,1.6592,1.0874,6.7033,1.5939,1.8745,5.8406,0.0487,1.8947,9.7723,3.1264,1.8276,1.9091,1.1138,1.0247,0.2373,2.2791,2.0139,2.0153,6.868,0.4146,5.3373,3.0084,1.0621,0.371,1.5927,1.0317,0.205,6.9851,4.2025,1.9744,0.3254,0.6912,1.707,0.1308,4.1536,2.6701,1.3794,0.559,0.3045,0.1427,0.2485,6.5097,4.6222,3.2584,0.6873,5.1975,3.3902,2.9523,3.2855,2.4376,0.023,3.799,1.3385,0.4218,0.4521,0.3112,0.1608,1.343,1.1144,2.4544,0.0036,0.2675,0.8267,1.582,1.068,0.93,4.3512,1.8292,1.3829,0.0133,2.8259,0.969,2.2101,2.2593,1.8818,0.7008,0.3295,3.0551,1.7095,0.9184,0.1776,0.0042,2.567,7.721,1.1832,2.3144,2.2626,0.2951,3.8383,2.5656,5.6706,0.2282,0.1115,3.3495,2.874,2.5262,4.0537,4.2891,5.1914,2.7249,6.4238,0.2427,7.5051,1.8411,0.1132,6.035,1.2406,2.0288,2.6558,1.6524,6.1133,5.7032,3.2519,1.338,2.8432,5.1401,4.5121,2.2358,1.1519,0.2458,1.0697,0.4583,1.2384,0.1046,0.1275,0.4925,0.0776,0.0874,0.0577,0.0656,0.0401,0.01,0.005,0.0027,0.0091,0.0003,0.0018,0.0192,0.0057,0.0007,0.0055,6.5474,0.3287,3.1622,1.2132,4.2642,1.2611,0.6565,2.7125,0.4547,6.0536,2.8056,4.6053,3.7611,0.003,0.0063,0.4164,5.0761,1.2429,2.4768,1.5702,3.2266,3.3611,0.9441,1.2969,4.8591,3.8325,1.045,0.9386,2.4589,7.1847,2.0119,5.2344,3.2655,0.0009,1.4243,3.6063,0.1384,0.3586,4.3734,0.6862,6.6025,0.0045,2.0819,1.0228,3.3596,0.4815,3.7294,2.332,0.641,4.893,5.6672,6.0552,6.2753,2.3189,0.947,0.3497,2.0804,2.9568,2.0924,4.7266,2.5083,2.3317,0.0059,1.0853,2.1436,0.457,2.201,4.5688,1.8643,0.3747,1.7166,1.0722,4.8234,3.2661,2.7736,2.2354,5.6618,0.0113,2.9331,3.8194,4.0995,3.0215,8.6639,0.754,4.6264,4.6077,0.8449,0.454,2.0097,2.4622,1.4483,5.0748,0.7804,3.4449,2.3154,3.113,2.3091,0.022,1.8756,5.5782,1.5749,3.8112,1.4625,0.8322,9.6168,0.888,5.6455,3.0495,6.4376,5.1577,3.3692,2.8312,6.9599,1.2742,0.6321,1.7194,2.1656,1.065,2.356,1.2833,3.8184,2.0576,1.3045,1.3554,0.4525,1.1423,0.4036,1.9785,9.582,6.934,2.6634,0.8457,1.184,0.8541,1.4413,0.2291,2.6997,4.396,3.327,3.7969,2.4038,0.0602,3.7714,0.6378,5.4766,0.2572,2.617,0.7442,0.8687,5.3332,5.5814,2.0905,3.8396,0.0014,2.3698,5.0531,1.6471,1.0227,4.8222,1.8377,0.2416,0.7922,0.6943,0.4492,3.3209,3.8909,1.332,1.3294,1.8154,6.3533,0.836,0.885,0.006,3.5089,4.2133,2.0614,5.127,0.5161,0.6473,0.3235,0.0295,5.6439,0.436]}
{"prompt":"The head of an opposition alliance in Honduras on Tuesday said the group would file a legal challenge to annul the official results of last month s disputed vote that handed victory to the sitting","text":"The head of an opposition alliance in Honduras on Tuesday said the group would file a legal challenge to annul the official results of last month s disputed vote that handed victory to the sitting president.\nJose Manuel Zelaya, a former ambassador to Russia and a member of the opposition Unidad Nacional Opositora (National Opposition Unity) coalition, told Reuters he would file the case Friday.\nOfficials in Honduras have refused to accept the election results, which say Zelaya won a second term by a narrow margin.\nZelaya says President Porfirio Lobo didn t have a valid mandate for a second four-year term, citing irregularities in the voting machine that favored Lobo. His supporters say the evidence presented by Lobo s administration is fabricated to give Lobo an easier term.\nBoth groups say they suspect the president s administration didn t allow Zelaya into Tegucigalpa to return the votes, as instructed by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.\nLast Thursday, Lobo was inaugurated with a strong mandate on Saturday, after refusing to accept provisional results of Tuesday s election that declared himself triumphant.\nLobo has dismissed nearly all of the judges on the electoral tribunal, saying the court has become a tool of opponents who seek to oust him. He said on Monday that he had fired five of the eight judges in the tribunal. He has demanded the resignation of all election officials, including his vice president and some presidential aides. The Supreme Court has refused to take action against Lobo s government officials.\nOn top of that, the U.N. Mission of Support started questioning the legitimacy of the election after finding numerous problems, including cheating and manipulation.\n\u201cWe must have to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was fraudulent and we need the people to demand its annulment and demand justice,\u201d Zelaya said. \u201cWe must hold a new election because the election was fraudulent.\u201d\nThis weekend, Zelaya said the opposition is hoping to hold a national congress to elect a new president within six months.\nLobo, who was sworn in last week in a military ceremony amid a bloodless coup, did not comment on Zelaya s remarks.

The president also said he would try to negotiate a deal with the Democrats in Congress that would be more restrictive than the status quo.\nSenator Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and Senator Kelly Ayotte, R-N.C., joined Democrats in criticizing Trump's immigration stance.\nGraham, the lone Republican to vote against the impeachment of outgoing President Trump for inciting the siege on the Capitol, said he had concerns about Trump's proposed changes.\n\"I don't think President Trump should be allowed to waive regulations that prevent us from doing the most basic business,\" Graham said on Thursday. \"It isn't a free pass to just have a free ride on the bureaucracy.\"","token_len":568,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.8114,1.8006,2.3178,0.5298,5.5463,5.5296,2.4986,3.0751,4.65,3.5401,8.9545,1.4009,2.371,0.0729,1.7408,4.0442,1.8901,7.0752,2.4041,1.4224,1.9022,3.2698,1.6417,3.4669,8.2731,3.9423,1.0155,0.036,1.9008,0.9994,4.5405,3.9082,2.3204,1.1119,2.9588,0.5913,2.9905,0.0011,2.2384,0.9813,0.218,0.2262,11.1135,5.1654,2.0389,0.9969,0.4295,0.2961,1.9591,1.7465,5.1332,2.135,1.5229,0.3443,0.2648,2.4243,2.4565,1.7206,0.007,2.232,6.5557,7.2869,2.1029,2.3386,0.3922,2.3689,1.7359,0.8696,2.2258,0.5829,6.8842,0.4583,1.4409,6.1467,0.4194,2.6291,2.5821,2.5576,0.6536,11.3287,4.4873,1.1987,0.0044,0.3093,1.455,3.9203,1.5519,2.0549,6.3912,3.0586,2.7135,2.2502,0.5964,0.235,4.0987,1.2487,3.9609,0.638,7.3591,5.7324,0.0857,16.1033,6.2201,1.3343,0.6645,6.2682,0.2185,4.1503,0.2344,2.2439,3.9302,2.2033,2.7641,0.3588,0.576,4.7361,0.7409,6.7747,0.061,4.6092,1.7442,0.9707,3.4309,0.2326,6.4096,3.0549,1.124,2.0583,0.1989,4.4929,2.0537,2.3326,3.7058,2.1354,3.4874,0.003,4.913,1.5727,0.889,0.1975,0.5436,2.7677,5.2499,2.1553,4.5338,1.0999,1.3021,5.0344,3.5605,1.1287,4.462,4.4504,5.6863,2.2585,5.4053,2.7031,5.3313,1.6866,1.6114,5.106,5.9516,1.2873,4.3679,2.3473,0.2095,0.6505,0.2338,0.0422,2.3251,0.0002,0.0007,1.0834,5.9949,4.9517,0.7686,1.4289,0.0545,2.1119,3.2587,5.144,1.4231,6.5613,0.4122,0.5983,2.0256,3.0919,1.2529,5.7417,0.9461,1.3504,1.5525,5.4762,2.9586,0.3243,0.8695,4.802,0.0351,5.7453,7.7568,6.0867,4.3605,1.4863,3.3517,4.6009,1.3508,3.7668,0.798,1.7205,2.7405,1.2929,2.6262,0.715,0.9105,3.4457,0.2088,2.8564,3.466,4.0839,0.0021,1.1201,4.7614,4.6029,1.6008,1.6644,3.9767,3.5238,3.4359,4.8372,1.6877,0.7154,4.7709,1.8295,3.2773,3.0563,0.4628,5.5733,0.7991,0.0039,0.1186,3.3377,0.0231,1.2585,1.3834,1.2369,1.8982,2.1656,8.2652,0.3598,0.0104,1.1213,14.2862,8.8834,1.8983,3.3469,0.6431,0.4435,0.8255,1.4319,4.3885,1.2548,3.7733,0.8143,0.0478,5.0706,2.3453,2.5327,4.1424,1.0163,2.5903,1.3858,2.6685,0.7493,0.429,5.5705,5.5413,8.4462,10.2555,6.086,4.7486,2.1274,3.171,0.8021,0.2962,0.1232,4.7505,0.815,7.0803,1.2783,2.7565,4.6371,1.9127,1.1396,3.6625,7.2915,3.0766,1.3152,2.7896,2.9702,0.065,0.1885,1.5237,0.5802,0.419,0.7774,4.4957,0.0134,2.0543,3.0204,4.48,1.205,2.0804,4.0134,4.8528,1.6606,0.9431,0.4187,0.0451,1.9748,0.3095,5.2042,5.0165,4.8335,2.6659,3.9452,5.6473,1.2514,8.2296,4.9288,0.6887,7.7063,3.7615,0.2629,1.2114,1.5326,2.391,0.0833,0.0522,0.042,0.2354,0.4528,0.0447,0.1253,1.0749,3.3382,2.8743,2.4526,1.859,0.5534,0.5084,2.8884,3.7645,1.6057,5.275,0.0443,4.8734,0.1923,1.6311,4.0196,2.1144,7.7369,2.1692,3.3345,0.7398,1.1643,0.3309,2.4489,0.7553,2.4088,2.7584,0.0007,6.542,4.0767,3.3144,3.4126,2.913,2.2125,2.6166,0.0,3.5067,1.0575,1.3986,0.6367,4.1596,3.9417,0.237,0.5577,5.2106,2.5726,3.5322,0.7566,1.9674,0.6907,1.6882,4.5245,1.0814,1.0852,1.3229,0.4631,0.6319,2.2295,0.6332,0.291,0.526,0.3164,3.6726,2.646,5.6456,1.818,0.111,4.1741,2.1587,0.5196,3.3952,3.6734,1.4959,0.352,0.8507,0.4677,1.4708,3.6252,1.1199,0.0923,0.001,4.3917,1.0019,2.9265,2.6045,2.9891,1.9754,1.1272,0.297,4.4728,0.1061,3.3637,0.6841,1.9739,0.7236,2.1922,1.8543,1.9937,2.3013,2.7979,0.594,3.6855,2.1565,2.756,1.1015,1.0586,7.0411,0.0213,0.7666,0.3758,7.8741,3.5749,0.0487,0.6506,3.3891,0.0057,2.9588,0.0003,0.0301,3.7925,1.8824,4.878,0.0006,0.0,0.6326,0.097,0.0008,1.2521,0.0002,4.2525,0.0157,4.778,3.1705,0.6354,3.8028,1.1297,1.1727,2.0172,2.626,1.0055,0.4065,7.2713,2.1396,3.3628,4.8569,0.6674,1.4334,1.0245,0.2904,1.2825,10.9104,0.5979,5.6287,0.5767,4.9036,4.979,6.2065,4.7966,13.0074,2.6025,0.8234,5.3858,0.7941,0.6675,1.8668,3.2101,4.164,0.5192,1.8962,0.1472,3.7636,5.0575,2.4402,0.2744,0.4351,1.4246,2.2938,0.0382,0.752,5.3452,0.0734,2.5697,1.1154,3.2929,0.052,8.341,7.1418,2.316,4.4957,2.7037,0.0279,2.6025,2.9489,5.3505,2.7379,5.0113,4.7448,0.4085,0.2483,1.9969,2.6219,0.3373,0.8762,2.9618,5.4645,0.0136,2.4897,5.8006,2.9935,2.4854,4.7276,4.8865,1.631,4.3926,3.9469,2.0994,1.0727,7.3263,1.1601]}

We continue to implement the National Plan to Eradicate the Weed (NPEH) in its second phase, the Anti-Coca Plan 2013-2017, the eradication programs initiated in several rural areas where coca grows, the National Program for the Eradication and Alternative Development of the Illegal Cultivation of Cannabis (PNPEC), the National Plan for Sustainable Development, the National Drug Court Plan (PNAD), the National Plan for the Social Reintegration of Cultivators in coca lands, the International Program to Eradicate Illicit Crop in Bolivia, Peru and Colombia (Bono Verde) and the Alternative Development Program (ADR),\u201d the statement says.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press last week, Trump said he looked at the report and said at the time that he did not downgrade the U.S. status because of the data, which reflected positive results in the field.","token_len":568,"entropy":[9.0624,0.5846,5.8143,2.5119,5.4766,0.649,4.7176,0.0036,5.609,0.2898,0.1997,3.2191,3.1208,5.0206,0.0079,0.3148,0.117,1.4804,0.3644,0.0037,2.6677,1.6618,6.8021,10.1786,2.1247,1.0082,1.3389,7.6478,1.7983,6.0596,0.0025,6.0279,6.9483,0.3866,4.7155,2.2986,0.0376,3.0417,8.2043,0.1082,4.0599,0.0233,3.3764,1.4581,9.8161,1.1199,1.8326,3.491,0.0077,4.1762,10.0294,0.6388,17.5977,9.5849,4.7436,2.288,0.0158,4.07,4.3056,0.942,4.2984,7.0426,0.9544,2.4773,11.6694,7.155,6.2727,4.8028,0.1499,2.3663,4.1261,6.4091,4.3863,12.3732,7.2748,7.0803,1.6938,2.098,2.4878,6.7925,5.6607,1.2027,0.503,1.3454,0.3146,0.3371,0.5683,0.7661,1.8648,1.2873,4.2401,3.344,5.8259,3.7083,2.6932,1.7699,0.431,2.1673,0.0018,0.5969,0.5145,2.4531,0.0643,4.8811,0.155,0.0019,1.9643,0.0326,0.0173,4.9642,1.2422,2.112,0.971,6.0236,0.6274,4.2489,1.1309,3.128,2.1102,0.0113,0.4582,0.9172,0.5428,7.877,5.1565,0.1785,0.18,2.0153,4.0129,3.5104,1.8391,8.7561,0.6526,3.311,0.5268,1.7293,1.7967,3.4511,3.9909,1.7307,1.1233,4.5495,11.1615,0.4134,2.4386,1.2347,2.8004,0.0173,2.3522,5.163,1.5429,4.6081,0.7746,0.0037,1.3849,5.5644,2.5052,3.4751,0.0027,3.5343,0.6089,1.0104,0.3172,2.3787,1.9202,7.5982,0.0039,5.2794,5.6279,1.9756,2.72,2.4768,0.8903,0.2594,3.4239,2.491,1.442,1.3244,1.6641,4.6489,0.0122,5.3926,3.609,0.5476,6.2333,1.7789,4.2671,2.7916,0.0234,2.5332,7.507,1.1938,0.0047,0.1233,0.0004,0.4149,0.025,14.9674,0.926,2.1715,4.6005,4.4007,2.7793,0.0071,0.4063,0.5198,2.1089,0.6315,4.8653,8.0619,1.4488,0.6444,0.0674,3.6199,0.7291,0.8412,5.1902,8.9364,2.556,0.0206,5.3892,0.9861,1.803,4.7962,0.0038,1.5232,4.4451,1.1595,2.8423,2.3982,0.7154,3.1482,0.0454,6.6109,6.6438,0.6628,1.7316,3.4331,0.0922,3.4956,0.8245,1.3355,8.4878,0.1881,1.071,0.6747,1.6536,0.9863,6.3698,0.0345,0.0008,1.037,1.0582,8.8582,7.6471,0.6413,0.8144,2.7378,3.2915,4.7652,1.8664,2.5263,0.8845,0.161,4.5545,3.6078,5.5551,0.0019,3.1115,0.0124,0.754,1.0824,1.7063,5.3511,0.0028,1.1717,4.6413,7.7575,2.8629,2.6649,5.5413,2.4192,2.6673,2.4188,3.5351,0.4276,0.7523,2.8005,4.5917,0.8783,0.5985,1.2928,3.2891,0.2776,5.1891,7.4147,0.0603,0.5776,0.0023,0.513,0.175,1.3509,0.1394,1.9146,2.8267,1.4796,4.7705,0.487,2.7862,2.5227,0.0001,1.0687,1.6447,0.0032,0.0011,3.6053,0.2785,1.8506,5.5555,3.6136,0.1862,3.5248,5.9844,1.629,2.9435,0.0133,0.0664,5.0707,3.2008,2.4922,2.0095,5.4173,2.5256,0.3076,1.1745,2.1497,2.2598,2.9518,2.9437,2.8364,2.36,0.3364,0.1199,4.2812,3.4519,0.0034,2.6626,2.0436,0.8864,1.5295,0.0039,0.5217,0.2091,0.2043,1.1498,0.0543,1.7116,4.3721,3.4845,0.032,1.0633,1.4584,5.8046,3.5239,2.6488,0.0272,5.3673,0.8712,2.9879,0.2517,0.147,1.2128,4.7545,4.3028,0.0866,0.1032,6.5666,4.1489,5.5104,3.3254,0.1652,5.5604,1.5813,6.1382,5.6095,2.5234,8.3598,0.0073,0.0045,1.4062,10.2366,4.5466,1.9971,4.8837,5.3712,0.4807,2.1495,5.3584,7.0393,0.8154,1.1553,4.1644,7.5067,0.033,1.72,3.0461,5.0173,8.596,1.5404,3.2648,0.7142,4.0832,6.1452,0.0087,6.9306,5.3439,1.1179,7.36,7.2086,0.7616,5.8686,0.5507,0.0077,4.4994,1.1006,2.7237,3.6714,4.5362,1.3102,1.7492,5.8851,0.0052,0.0374,2.6281,9.0399,4.3265,0.6536,2.3264,4.134,2.8858,0.1279,0.4585,3.0046,0.6009,4.229,4.9743,2.8754,1.8306,1.7186,1.6116,2.4165,0.3016,5.8937,1.354,2.6762,1.3348,1.2203,3.8347,7.331,6.7675,2.5933,4.082,5.9237,1.8063,1.1059,0.975,2.1516,0.1595,2.0796,6.4478,5.2651,0.4929,0.0009,0.4633,5.9257,0.817,0.0592,3.2342,10.5797,0.0034,8.625,0.5966,1.162,5.0645,4.3715,2.1936,4.8514,0.0004,0.0196,5.6603,0.0063,4.1262,2.6492,2.752,5.7345,0.7573,9.4168,1.1544,2.0095,3.0446,13.623,3.4205,7.5508,0.8552,2.1691,0.3129,0.4708,7.7857,2.594,1.6099,1.4792,2.3899,6.9904,2.7013,2.7368,1.0574,3.4669,4.2252,5.2287,0.0393,0.172,3.2513,3.6078,0.6849,0.367,3.0684,1.7359,0.0004,3.6013,1.1189,0.0918,4.6158,0.9932,1.0134,5.5467,2.373,0.9588,2.7769,0.9718,2.3335,6.6171,0.6551,0.7683,1.0804,0.9775,3.3235,0.1,10.7261,1.5009,3.4851,0.0008,0.0014,0.2114,2.5804,2.9657,0.4118,0.8105,7.6519,2.3722,3.2046,7.0021,6.1657,2.5603,1.9071,1.5549,4.5313,0.6081]}

We have, as part of our overall strategy, a set of objectives.\u201d\nIn response, a spokesman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, said the chairman is working with the secretary of Defense and his staff to \u201cdeliver on our mutual goal of defeating terrorism in the region and advancing our interests in the region,\u201d a Pentagon spokesman said.\n\u201cWe will seek, as we seek all of that, to work with our partner nations to do what needs to be done,\u201d Dunford said.\nMattis said the U.S. military plans to continue focusing on counterterrorism and protecting against potential cross-border attacks in Afghanistan that could affect the West.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in trying to go after the terrorists in Afghanistan by a direct military attack at the moment,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cBut we will do everything we can to prevent a cross-border operation that could lead towards something like this. And if that\u2019s the end result, well, unfortunately it could be more than necessary to fight that war.\u201d\nFormer U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey has suggested the U.S. military needs to go to war with Russia in the Black Sea, especially around Russia\u2019s nuclear capabilities.\nOn Monday, Dempsey, who retired last fall as the United States\u2019 highest ranking general, said Russia\u2019s nuclear warhead stockpile should be treated as a potential weapon of mass destruction. On Tuesday, he said the U.S. needs to get ready for a conflict in the Black Sea.\n\u201cIf Russia\u2019s nuclear stockpile and capabilities are to be treated as weapons of mass destruction, then a nuclear war in the Black Sea is possible. That is why we must be ready to defend against them,\u201d Dempsey said at the Center for International and Security Strategy\u2019s annual conference in Washington.","token_len":569,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,6.2798,1.0504,2.3973,0.0081,1.8495,2.0911,1.9479,2.972,1.9108,6.1894,0.6401,1.8418,5.4006,1.0614,0.9374,8.8004,0.0704,0.1731,0.1649,0.0008,0.2209,0.0001,3.2168,8.6228,3.3913,0.6389,0.005,15.3802,7.4009,8.4418,11.4054,5.2206,3.8456,6.6592,2.3988,6.1865,4.0764,2.0864,6.0722,1.319,8.9255,4.5676,0.6953,5.671,3.2378,0.0007,0.001,0.0792,1.8142,1.2076,2.1904,3.3265,1.163,0.7882,22.7265,0.0001,1.6811,5.1186,2.9072,5.4308,0.0133,2.7117,0.3085,3.987,0.5055,0.7763,4.363,12.2752,2.6239,1.4234,3.7916,1.2212,3.5607,5.1023,3.646,0.4226,4.4888,5.9824,0.2452,0.47,1.4833,5.1062,3.7705,4.0857,0.2223,3.382,2.382,1.6382,0.0004,0.0018,0.1782,0.9711,3.1449,1.823,3.5081,1.2928,0.4984,3.2239,4.1164,6.3928,3.7062,2.5034,3.3468,0.202,7.9829,1.2813,5.6202,7.4411,3.3918,1.0236,6.9471,0.0022,1.7666,1.9812,2.6698,1.329,2.3412,5.904,2.9958,0.4257,4.9145,0.9783,3.508,1.0815,0.5032,1.0774,0.5523,4.6552,2.0393,2.1355,6.3995,0.1612,3.7636,1.7612,2.0217,5.8849,0.1745,5.5011,5.1063,5.115,1.3515,1.0338,1.2237,0.6036,0.3525,0.4322,3.2915,0.2598,1.2115,1.433,1.2192,2.1044,0.0116,1.2022,4.6942,2.2667,9.9324,0.8278,0.05,7.096,0.44,5.3527,2.7874,1.72,2.3725,1.7477,1.6901,0.7753,5.4528,2.6073,4.1656,0.0017,1.2899,4.4462,0.763,0.63,1.1324,1.3984,0.0178,0.7965,3.6422,2.9595,1.8201,0.2988,4.2572,3.9754,1.9508,3.6324,2.5542,0.0328,1.1276,5.6748,0.4296,0.0656,0.0405,0.0447,0.076,0.0005,0.8574,0.8562,0.7079,0.0148,0.0,0.3706,0.6885,1.8158,3.9451,2.2615,3.6772,1.05,0.9829,2.3688,0.2737,2.2051,1.8895,3.5171,1.1034,0.5987,13.3694,1.3,4.2008,0.0341,2.295,3.2896,7.1707,2.4966,0.466,3.9294,0.7103,1.7607,1.8986,1.0907,1.7534,4.7273,2.0194,2.9431,0.8368,1.0974,0.4562,2.6667,0.8002,1.3302,3.3507,5.4274,0.4932,0.2549,0.3688,0.1659,1.727,0.4637,2.0412,2.302,5.0955,5.4335,1.8757,1.4314,4.6545,6.5315,2.3875,4.4532,0.7521,1.0384,3.2793,0.8629,2.1385,4.6715,1.7736,0.8948,4.9815,1.561,4.3416,0.0257,0.0257,0.0159,2.0435,0.478,0.8062,0.9185,0.0009,0.3811,0.3406,0.4383,3.351,0.003,1.2842,1.4088,3.0778,0.0004,0.0012,0.0675,1.3959,4.0661,0.2947,3.2042,6.67,0.2699,2.7836,1.836,4.9435,4.5948,4.2136,7.1163,0.1407,0.0643,1.3105,2.5877,1.612,4.8235,1.0528,3.883,1.3386,4.5952,0.9677,0.3159,1.4463,0.1996,1.0483,5.1483,2.3377,6.7549,0.0345,3.6033,3.3442,4.7912,0.0657,3.4335,1.5304,2.7677,2.6656,2.3318,2.1397,4.8016,4.8494,4.7599,1.4003,2.164,6.348,1.6406,3.5489,0.8794,0.1532,0.6389,0.6571,0.1389,0.1447,2.7952,0.073,2.7029,0.6059,2.168,2.5837,2.2065,0.7003,0.064,0.2595,2.9204,3.2438,5.6849,0.0353,0.0425,5.625,1.7779,0.9189,1.9807,7.4862,5.2233,1.7377,2.9787,1.2527,4.8103,3.3286,1.8969,6.3312,3.1001,3.5054,1.4244,4.8978,2.4692,0.6582,5.8487,0.3023,8.2236,2.1347,3.0343,0.9918,4.3317,1.5171,8.6101,1.8879,4.2075,2.275,4.1656,1.1837,2.5584,1.062,0.1112,7.0707,1.882,0.0003,0.0062,0.0016,1.6713,3.3172,0.1238,0.0109,1.3739,0.008,1.7159,0.0309,4.0208,4.5157,1.5233,1.3775,0.0004,0.0012,0.0176,0.9943,2.8974,0.3259,3.9475,1.9135,0.548,1.6932,4.6193,2.213,1.8266,8.0673,0.0291,1.9727,5.7444,5.8833,4.0956,7.8339,0.7815,2.7424,4.6126,4.045,0.5998,0.3616,5.006,1.7945,0.159,1.5869,2.6832,1.4234,2.9543,2.0611,4.628,3.499,1.6307,3.9019,0.0451,11.9641,0.435,10.4962,0.2345,2.9658,0.3462,1.3603,2.1997,6.0846,0.0932,0.0261,1.1726,6.3018,0.1413,8.0499,3.2247,0.3028,7.0924,0.3796,0.624,3.7613,3.1179,0.8045,0.0948,0.0059,0.8868,6.3873,0.8823,0.0821,1.4734,0.8339,1.6477,1.1429,0.0006,0.0028,0.04,3.2797,0.1163,3.7472,3.7251,0.8096,1.2953,5.2004,1.7994,0.9044,1.9384,0.0029,1.8529,0.2502,1.5787,0.4322,2.9561,1.6761,3.8286,0.0373,0.004,0.612,5.3016,5.2355,4.3282,0.7683,3.1282,0.2926,2.3415,0.1693,2.1736,0.1733,0.0097,0.0042,0.2262,2.3343,4.312,3.5236,0.7212,3.067,0.2569,0.3028,0.0016,1.7999,3.9952,1.647,3.9449,1.4529,1.8297,1.0501,2.6292,2.8141,1.1882,1.1325,2.5298,3.0076,4.3407,1.9397,0.1184,1.0633,0.1185,0.2913,4.6521,1.3113,5.5427,0.0911,5.8997,1.6769,0.8706,8.1687,4.3212,0.5393,1.8802,1.5052,2.1174,0.7962,0.5828,0.4551]}

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered the final reading, with a voice filled with emotion that seemed to be moving some in attendance. \"It's a bill that is an historic break with Obama-bashing conservatism,\" McConnell said. The Republican tax bill had its worst possible start in the Senate. It was quickly pushed aside after a series of Democratic filibuster-hogs that left the chamber mired in the longest government shutdown in history. The Democrats who blocked the bill said they would allow a vote on the bill if the Republican tax plan could be amended to exclude some of the largest payers. In a matter of hours, Democrats in the Senate reached an agreement over a bipartisan plan that included a tax break for some middle-class Americans. The measure now includes a break for those who earn 80 percent or more of their income from wages, and will cost $1 trillion in annual tax cuts over 10 years. The Republican tax plan would replace the income tax with a tax on consumption. The GOP proposal is seen as too expensive to be adopted, and has been criticized by Democrats for not cutting taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest. But some conservatives and centrists in the Democratic party say that the GOP plan will make their case. \"They have got to go,\" said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who had previously shown signs of backing the GOP plan. \"Tax cuts are not enough. The big issue is economic development.\" With the tax break now on the table, McConnell on Friday delivered the remaining parts of his sweeping, $26-billion tax plan, including major cuts to the middle class. The tax bill is an historic break with Obama-bashing conservatism: it includes an overhaul of the income tax, as well as a tax on consumption. But it won't take effect until 2020, and Republicans say it has a lot of holes. To some, it's expensive, though some of its provisions are likely to be passed by a supermajority. It still won't pass unless the tax law changes to be less burdensome on capital gains. And some moderate conservative voices aren't convinced. \"This is what we need,\" said Sen.

The law prohibits the sale of drinking straws and other disposable plastic items in all grocery stores, restaurants, and retail stores in California. As reported by AP, under the new law, these items must be compostable, sustainable, biodegradable, or bio-degradable and can no longer be reused. The goal of the law has been to combat plastic pollution and...\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown today signed health care legislation prohibiting the sales of certain single-use plastic straws across the state.

{"prompt":"South Korean President Moon Jae-in had initially suggested on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump make a visit to the demilitarized zone ( DMZ ) between North and South Korea , a Blue House official","text":"South Korean President Moon Jae-in had initially suggested on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump make a visit to the demilitarized zone ( DMZ ) between North and South Korea, a Blue House official said, citing his request for early negotiations on \u201cmutual understanding and cooperation.\u201d\nTrump will visit North Korea on Thursday, the fourth day of his visit to Asia as the most powerful American leader in years. He is scheduled to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later this week in Hanoi.\nBut Moon\u2019s idea to offer Trump a visit to the DMZ was first reported Tuesday night by a CNN report of a South Korean official who told reporters the proposal was only a matter of \u201cdecision making.\u201d\nA senior presidential official said Wednesday there was no decision and the White House had not yet received a formal request.\n\u201c[The South Korean President] and [Trump] expressed mutual interest in reaching mutual understanding and cooperation to create an entirely new climate where peace and prosperity could flourish and we have made good progress, but we need to ensure we make concrete decisions,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.\nA senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to comment on the White House official\u2019s remark but said there had been no request for an official visit from North Korea.\nKim traveled to the DMZ with a group of Korean workers that was sponsored by the North\u2019s central executive committee, according to the official.\nNorth Korea and its neighbor of South Korea were officially part of a Korean UN mission in the 1960s.

{"prompt":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not comment on the planned U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital on Wednesday during his first public remarks since the White House confirmed the new policy .","text":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not comment on the planned U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital on Wednesday during his first public remarks since the White House confirmed the new policy. Netanhayu Yisrael Party said Netanyahu said the American deal that gave Israel its highest honor was not an agreement between Israel and the United States but an agreement with a dictator and a politician whose country is not under international law. The Israeli prime minister also said his country needs a permanent U.N. peacekeeping station in the occupied West Bank. The announcement of the United States recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel had sparked protests by Palestinians, who have called it illegal under international law. The decision would also bring the country into direct conflict with its Arab neighbors, who were not directly involved in the U.S.-Israeli deal that brought peace between the two countries in 1995.\nBy a vote of 21 against 16 members of Parliament on Wednesday, the Israel Knesset passed resolution condemning the Palestinian president.\n\"Our government does not recognize the Palestinian president and this must be stated on the face of history because we will see how it is handled by the future, \" said MK Moshe Feiglin, who sponsored the resolution.\nIn a gesture to the US, the Palestinians have accepted the Israeli government's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and have also agreed to participate in formal peace talks with the Israelis, even if they do not have any concrete demands such as the withdrawal from areas seized during the 1967 war.\nNetanyahu rejected those requests and said that Israel is a sovereign nation that will make its own decisions. The Israeli prime minister said the United States has decided to recognize Jerusalem as a national capital of Israel, a decision that \"violates all international law, human rights, and international diplomacy.\"\nThe decision will be controversial also on the ground. While the Palestinians have called it a decision aimed at humiliating them, many Israelis see it as a welcome move that strengthens their resolve to stay at the city.\nAt the same time, the Jerusalem dispute is becoming a new source of conflict between the Palestinians and their neighbors in the region. In the first wave of protests after the announcement of the deal, the Palestinians called for a boycott of American products.\n\"Our government will not negotiate with them [Palestinian negotiators]. We will not sit with them like prisoners in a prison,\" said Netanyahu on Wednesday. \"I want to announce the following point: our government will not compromise.\"\nThere has been no agreement yet on the steps Israel and the Palestinians will take when they sit around the table. Netanyahu says Palestinians would need to recognize his government's right to exist alongside Jewish Israel, the Palestinians say Israel should pull back all of the territory it occupied in the 1967 war and the West Bank would have to be given its full legal rights.","token_len":571,"entropy":[8.7696,0.0051,1.5254,0.0003,6.504,0.2641,4.2965,0.4934,0.6226,7.0548,5.0515,0.0443,0.1946,0.1476,7.6091,0.3518,1.0324,0.6836,0.6334,12.1407,3.9831,2.5091,2.0914,4.9841,1.8219,2.9458,2.5324,1.1476,0.8461,1.177,5.6466,0.0003,6.0576,1.8055,4.4272,3.2498,0.7084,8.8006,5.1948,6.0595,5.6874,6.2345,6.8538,2.2708,0.0262,7.1553,5.2402,1.3503,4.1839,1.463,5.1084,5.6605,5.4714,5.2786,1.9679,4.206,5.2224,3.8759,2.0916,2.8948,3.037,3.198,2.958,1.5038,0.0368,0.128,1.4427,0.0044,2.1144,2.3389,0.76,2.8015,2.451,10.1097,3.4257,2.2637,6.4544,3.9708,3.9915,1.7129,2.9152,3.7211,2.8289,0.7076,0.3569,2.5178,3.8214,1.7839,0.0106,2.1972,1.1132,3.544,0.9392,5.9309,2.0047,4.4897,2.3221,0.0006,2.0507,0.0118,2.5885,0.9041,6.8371,1.0937,0.753,2.1295,0.7893,0.0001,0.9619,2.4301,2.7375,2.667,0.3934,3.69,0.5731,4.4855,0.1158,0.7013,1.5674,0.0958,0.1684,0.1684,5.5071,3.6361,2.5692,2.6794,0.8325,2.0209,0.6455,2.0533,2.4598,2.1319,3.1578,1.8793,0.1285,0.0128,0.5738,2.0259,3.6938,4.2174,3.2541,4.3327,1.256,3.8502,1.7614,2.5313,0.5469,0.0098,4.3323,1.9198,0.2838,1.0984,1.2479,5.2458,3.2104,5.4492,0.9554,0.1133,0.2937,2.3151,0.0003,0.236,0.925,2.7252,3.2978,4.4634,3.7613,2.521,3.8576,1.8436,0.6496,0.8573,1.7717,4.0219,0.1486,2.3469,11.7416,5.8523,1.3029,0.0409,5.8411,7.2096,4.2608,7.9022,0.5566,3.9001,2.723,1.0671,0.2082,1.1063,4.8078,5.3835,0.0036,0.0,1.8516,4.8842,5.4986,0.3283,4.9168,3.9897,4.4877,1.7809,2.4275,4.8166,2.9481,3.641,0.0213,0.8781,1.1819,2.6789,4.1185,2.6491,5.414,5.5649,1.0999,7.9,4.7665,0.9187,4.7043,0.0099,7.8696,5.8499,2.8335,3.2256,5.604,3.478,2.3326,1.6754,4.009,1.6236,0.6131,4.5475,5.2512,7.3004,1.6957,3.8631,3.1362,0.0005,4.4261,0.3247,0.5552,0.4361,1.8291,3.7877,0.078,0.2319,0.3528,0.9873,3.3129,1.202,8.0241,2.4226,1.2204,5.4159,0.7505,1.598,3.7714,3.4705,5.8892,0.926,4.0594,2.174,0.1394,2.0141,0.3107,0.2872,0.1916,1.4491,1.6799,0.0204,1.7041,2.537,4.0268,3.8281,0.152,5.2546,0.0717,6.7132,2.8443,0.3347,0.9529,0.5338,1.5466,2.2794,5.5677,2.2019,1.7295,2.3244,0.0927,3.188,3.3629,4.6147,5.5512,5.6814,0.0048,2.1262,3.8135,2.706,6.7886,3.9374,3.9337,0.392,0.1486,0.4989,0.3347,0.6666,2.8247,0.0009,5.9935,4.2581,5.1593,1.8557,1.5271,2.2303,3.4936,3.0925,3.3529,2.8819,1.0245,2.2253,3.3755,4.7013,1.5423,0.4489,0.5717,1.8735,3.3318,2.1529,0.8032,0.0105,1.4046,1.8181,1.8624,0.0197,2.5454,5.6979,0.7113,0.7526,0.2208,0.2025,2.8402,4.4538,0.8107,2.1184,0.2403,1.8707,3.0713,2.1526,0.6547,3.7261,6.4469,0.0459,2.9443,0.9913,0.3849,2.2403,4.8158,0.0359,1.0528,0.7696,1.214,7.0178,0.5765,0.4819,2.1089,3.4849,3.7382,1.8165,5.7131,7.9471,3.9266,0.8688,2.7311,3.0039,4.562,1.3546,2.1462,1.3981,3.4603,3.8722,1.0568,5.1384,4.5591,0.0521,6.024,2.7521,0.7745,3.5711,1.6923,2.9234,0.6274,0.0911,0.7814,7.005,2.2007,2.3451,5.0993,1.0789,2.1447,0.4338,4.0637,4.2741,0.7924,5.6633,1.1835,0.8008,5.0629,0.8472,1.0842,0.0102,0.0543,1.7794,5.3364,5.2982,1.8058,4.5229,1.2551,4.6327,4.9588,0.0248,3.8526,1.7918,1.1101,2.4599,0.1226,2.9673,3.2799,2.1139,0.193,3.2814,0.5858,2.7639,1.7707,3.6522,6.0643,0.0425,3.4356,4.0398,0.5081,3.3704,0.5699,0.1861,5.1305,0.4882,2.7063,1.6813,3.689,0.6205,1.8309,1.3715,0.321,3.1858,2.0541,2.8031,1.5395,2.2795,4.0966,2.208,2.4385,0.8275,5.3742,0.5544,3.3573,5.1837,5.0511,5.7921,3.2446,0.9248,0.5584,0.6147,4.1356,3.314,0.2268,5.6718,8.6178,1.9755,1.5954,1.6173,0.9635,0.7788,7.2704,3.3909,0.7747,0.5202,1.2631,3.6548,2.9658,0.8284,5.7773,2.2156,5.0114,6.5487,0.9868,4.6286,0.326,0.5654,0.3477,4.9982,4.4129,0.4369,5.6117,2.4019,0.1737,1.6381,3.286,3.7059,0.9294,1.3019,6.8935,3.2503,2.6292,0.1181,1.187,1.0894,0.0385,3.44,0.7769,6.5009,7.9446,0.3832,0.6397,1.8674,3.7744,5.2254,6.015,3.6727,3.9917,0.5922,4.8232,7.8665,1.3137,0.7167,4.591,0.0511,3.343,6.9097,5.6895,4.4613,1.7038,3.1667,3.8252,2.4132,4.0637,2.6807,7.3634,3.0195,5.1342,2.4966,2.6011,5.6738,0.8356,3.4039,1.3571,1.3052,0.2981,0.214,1.5135,2.9357,2.3124,0.0027,7.6849,2.9127,0.1385,2.1657,3.2789,3.7399,2.7337,2.2252,1.5348,0.549]}
{"prompt":"Some wealthy owners of U.S. major-league sports teams may have to put up more of their own money to fund stadium construction under a tax bill proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Republicans , but","text":"Some wealthy owners of U.S. major-league sports teams may have to put up more of their own money to fund stadium construction under a tax bill proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Republicans, but that proposal is stymied in the Senate and in the White House.\nGOP proposals would also tax some gambling winnings and raise the top rate of corporate tax while exempting some people, including those with low incomes. But several senators said the law would require more time to analyze more closely.\nThe GOP-controlled Congress, however, has tried for more than a year to pass a tax plan that would have raised taxes more than $300 billion for the first time in more than a decade.\nThe tax bill would also cut a huge swath of tax breaks in an effort to encourage Americans to earn more money.\nOne of the GOP's key aims is trying to persuade some Americans to earn more. The bill would raise the tax rate on wages and capital gains to 35 percent and increase the top marginal tax rate on corporations from 20 percent to 35 percent on incomes greater than $500,000 \u2014 the same cap that President Barack Obama has proposed.\nWhile some tax cuts can boost income, as they did in the 1980s and 1990s, raising taxes on capital gains would actually cut income more than it would raise tax payments, according to a report for the Congressional Budget Office.\nTaxpayers would lose $90 billion in tax breaks on capital gains, which would have to offset some of the tax savings from cutting corporate tax rates. For example, if corporate income tax rates are dropped from 20 percent to 10 percent, this would result in $2 billion in losses on corporate income tax and $90 billion in capital gains taxes.\nThe tax bill would also require a number of people working in entertainment, sports, and other industries to file tax returns.\nTaxpayers in those industries generally have very low or no tax liabilities. But if those taxpayers file regular tax returns they could face a large tax bill.\nSome large U.S. employers are also facing higher taxes. The bill includes a new tax on dividends as well as a new tax on corporate income that companies would have to pay on their stock dividends.\nThe tax bill could also lead to other changes that would increase costs or hamper business, such as tighten rules on how employers can deduct health care costs.\nMany GOP lawmakers said it would take time to study the proposed tax provisions. But they have said they would not push the tax measures through without getting a guarantee that the president's legislation would not be cut back significantly.\nPresident Obama is trying to gain support for his tax plan among conservatives by seeking bipartisan support for his proposals. He expects to present a plan that combines tax changes that Republicans have rejected with some tax changes that GOP lawmakers have proposed.","token_len":572,"entropy":[10.7039,5.8423,0.9027,4.6888,0.1538,0.0043,0.2179,6.5795,4.703,1.2336,3.7656,1.8809,3.7529,2.1984,2.6712,5.0805,0.9271,5.2162,2.6753,2.2186,1.2361,0.4215,1.0614,4.441,4.7057,1.9473,6.3139,1.8908,4.9986,2.664,3.7803,0.6375,5.2082,0.0123,0.0019,0.0024,2.3092,3.5332,0.0046,3.1968,2.5389,3.5861,2.6109,5.528,2.0488,6.8751,0.5889,0.0101,2.9546,0.9416,0.4553,3.6306,3.4504,0.8301,2.1499,0.0009,0.6295,0.2702,26.583,6.1373,2.0235,3.7524,4.9279,4.7817,8.1155,8.154,0.0525,2.5288,4.459,1.9506,4.0865,1.7551,1.5767,1.763,1.1873,7.5963,4.9819,0.0144,2.0944,5.8325,3.6239,1.6022,2.9604,1.5574,4.8791,0.356,1.2689,4.2179,6.2288,5.189,2.8591,1.7466,6.372,0.9591,5.2858,3.6744,3.4313,1.1754,5.2689,6.4352,3.685,3.9314,0.1743,11.971,4.0687,3.0409,2.03,2.578,3.1057,2.852,0.0008,0.9891,5.5464,3.2583,3.1829,0.1391,0.5104,1.0449,0.0425,1.3919,0.9729,2.1151,2.9277,0.5941,0.3877,3.2318,3.2698,2.1801,5.4216,2.3545,2.2678,3.8481,0.0454,3.2127,0.7989,3.1409,0.3809,0.8877,2.298,0.0004,1.0466,0.168,0.4587,0.9082,4.4015,3.2214,1.032,1.5903,1.5656,4.2082,3.7152,4.0956,3.1287,0.0233,3.2352,1.1756,4.8232,3.9654,0.3776,0.0128,3.8525,4.8071,0.083,6.4103,0.5507,1.4602,1.4585,1.0131,5.6642,1.3605,0.327,4.0684,0.9071,3.198,5.1515,0.6632,7.1746,0.0136,4.6561,4.2097,3.3954,0.625,6.6468,0.6137,2.503,2.1082,3.2454,0.5711,2.7796,1.4127,3.3519,0.401,0.8305,5.8618,2.3546,4.2104,0.0042,1.5982,1.8042,0.154,2.4054,4.2888,0.6459,1.6946,2.0905,1.0703,0.024,2.0122,5.4041,2.7562,2.7415,0.1513,0.0386,1.7966,0.0379,4.9332,2.609,5.2716,0.0037,0.0266,2.1569,0.0624,0.0022,5.1821,2.2865,1.8484,7.8201,1.54,3.9672,0.8495,0.0033,1.6606,2.3822,1.2113,0.3432,4.659,2.0546,3.5796,2.8579,5.5782,3.7758,2.8604,1.0933,5.584,3.7709,2.1565,0.978,0.9305,2.7259,0.0149,1.3116,0.2169,0.0001,0.1147,5.4833,1.1816,0.9348,3.4028,0.0357,2.3367,4.2703,4.5619,2.0367,4.7603,0.454,2.1612,0.7353,2.7774,3.5035,4.9992,2.0916,1.4366,0.001,1.3938,2.5286,6.3767,0.4229,2.2831,0.248,0.0003,0.8033,0.3644,3.8975,2.8117,1.341,3.8323,2.4366,6.0181,0.0896,1.5838,1.6677,2.5711,4.3834,2.488,0.0224,1.8852,2.9824,1.4553,2.9069,2.3892,5.3669,2.4564,0.2512,0.2189,2.5301,2.9414,2.7822,5.0856,2.8413,2.1488,0.0401,0.6679,5.5318,1.4599,0.0038,2.0116,4.641,1.4442,1.6688,0.2639,2.1153,6.9064,2.0823,2.5127,0.1282,0.1419,1.8362,0.0425,0.3891,5.0521,0.3226,3.1047,0.0017,1.57,3.48,2.115,0.4324,3.2195,2.434,4.583,0.756,1.1535,3.5389,0.3754,5.4413,0.1428,0.2849,3.1138,0.0481,1.3134,0.7975,0.2681,1.6917,3.2466,1.0997,0.8363,0.3638,3.8901,2.591,5.7149,0.002,4.9551,5.0688,1.0606,5.7262,1.2527,2.9732,1.0875,2.0949,1.3734,0.6922,0.2571,2.6671,2.7892,0.0781,1.5373,1.3786,4.2586,1.7209,3.4724,1.9689,0.2494,6.5978,3.2276,5.3074,1.6241,5.2383,0.2049,2.2055,3.501,1.5209,2.1052,2.8848,3.7625,3.867,2.6866,7.4296,2.8693,0.0627,5.0078,2.1207,1.853,1.5819,3.4539,1.146,0.7203,1.1871,0.6053,4.1823,5.8894,4.3635,0.0002,0.0011,0.0018,4.6341,2.8573,2.2888,3.2645,3.5747,1.7428,1.889,2.2129,5.6524,4.6576,0.7181,3.0069,1.8533,1.671,3.0323,5.7796,0.6322,0.0583,1.8236,1.2121,1.0762,0.1361,4.9711,1.2771,3.8973,6.717,2.5116,1.6641,0.018,0.3935,2.4754,1.1546,4.4293,3.7716,0.5847,0.7601,1.711,2.6739,1.1656,3.8584,0.4678,5.211,0.0852,4.4274,2.0159,1.8478,1.0354,3.0704,4.3929,4.7757,8.116,0.0006,3.4886,3.4363,1.3629,0.0006,12.0733,1.9355,0.9537,3.0561,4.5152,2.0137,2.6201,4.9584,2.1898,0.9427,1.4464,0.4564,4.5164,4.552,0.8381,2.4749,3.9422,1.1268,3.709,2.1833,0.7529,3.276,0.6963,4.3612,1.2332,5.3518,1.4692,1.9767,2.1096,2.6956,1.2935,0.5573,1.6603,3.0344,3.4014,2.4936,2.9732,6.7711,1.1945,3.128,5.0689,1.8848,9.0394,0.9703,1.3997,4.3523,2.4236,5.0109,0.5335,2.6875,2.4183,4.7775,5.5597,5.2857,0.3418,0.3001,5.3677,1.5749,3.2878,4.5315,0.0431,5.9236,1.8848,1.0944,0.5218,1.3013,0.856,6.4338,3.3349,3.1802,5.255,5.3448,0.2164,1.0417,1.0157,3.8422,0.6138,3.1313,7.3512,0.9437,4.9462,2.0077,2.6883,3.0326,6.077,2.832,3.5566,2.7495,4.3663,1.6887,4.1211,1.8581,3.1163,2.669,1.6543,0.6681,4.3538,1.0856,0.6781,2.9292,0.6355]}

The decree","text":"Venezuela s pro-government legislative superbody ruled on Wednesday that parties who boycotted this month s local elections had lost legitimacy, potentially eliminating the main opposition groups from the 2018 presidential race. The decree, issued by the National Assembly s ruling Socialist Party, declared all opposition parties, whether from outside or within Venezuela, to be illegitimate, a week after elections turned out to have been the worst since the military ousted former president Hugo Chavez. There have been a number of similar declarations in the past, mostly when the National Assembly s left has been in charge of voting in the legislative body, but never by the Communist Party, which has more than half the seats in the body, making it the primary powerbroker in Caracas since Chavez s death. The ruling party, known as the Polo Patri\u00f3tico, accused the opposition parties of boycotting the election, saying that that meant they could not be counted as valid. The Socialist Party had already barred all opposition parties, except Venezuela s center-left Unity Revolutionary Party, from participating in the April legislative elections. The decree, which doesn t apply to the opposition parties that ran, said such parties can only seek support from the party with which they were registered. The decree s most far-reaching consequence, though, is the threat it poses to the 2018 election. It requires state and municipal elections to be held in four months, on October 20, and for Venezuela to choose a new National Assembly by January 2018, meaning that the opposition groups that boycott the election are not allowed to participate. As it currently stands, the election has little legal meaning unless opposition parties agree to participate, but a series of legal actions could stall or block that, giving the administration more time to push voters to turn out. The government plans to run two candidates- Venezuelan revolutionary Raul Gorrin and businessman Carlos Lopez Marcano-the same way it did during the last legislative election. That was an unusual move by the Socialist Party, which has traditionally focused on running a single presidential candidate, to try to split opposition voting to the party. But that tactic failed since neither of the candidates actually ran in the December legislative election, after the opposition decided not to field their own candidates. Gorrin told news outlets last month that he is willing to field his own presidential candidate, giving the opposition another alternative. The decree, which could be challenged in courts, threatens to take away the best tool opposition parties had to prevent Maduro from reelection. The decree was signed in advance on Wednesday of the official results from the April 12 election, and the Socialist Party s decision, reported the state-owned television Globovision, was made to send a warning to other opposition parties that boycotted the election. Venezuela s state elections commission, which oversees elections at the state and municipal levels, said the opposition parties boycotted the election.","token_len":572,"entropy":[12.2028,0.1386,9.6698,8.9927,2.4529,1.9849,8.2849,8.2186,6.2968,6.4615,4.2433,3.5317,3.1571,10.5365,5.0562,10.7398,0.0012,0.0,5.9858,2.179,11.6277,7.772,0.6234,3.9055,4.4489,4.5361,2.086,5.9264,7.4673,1.2754,5.5946,0.8308,5.1501,2.6368,1.4219,4.8958,1.88,2.2538,0.1504,2.7131,5.2302,1.6718,1.905,0.6843,0.7953,1.5256,0.2639,7.9578,4.3966,5.2399,0.9743,0.8868,5.7692,4.8183,2.6935,0.431,2.4683,4.4821,4.5265,3.8854,0.6068,2.9398,1.6522,0.4675,0.985,0.7708,4.1501,2.1294,3.5907,8.7505,0.4528,5.2902,7.9889,1.2385,0.1834,2.7763,0.4328,6.3796,3.8022,1.9086,1.1321,4.8219,3.6103,2.9009,0.8562,0.1512,0.468,1.5193,6.1322,2.7603,0.1581,3.943,0.9175,0.0041,3.9508,4.2628,1.5162,1.1269,0.2033,1.5809,5.2956,5.2341,1.6003,3.4774,0.0587,1.9263,6.5825,9.2867,1.2876,2.25,3.7649,1.0362,4.7886,3.1426,1.8523,5.0607,1.9462,1.775,1.1156,5.1091,4.7446,0.8117,8.0448,0.3337,2.2852,0.9887,1.6294,5.9429,0.5784,3.3671,0.8657,1.178,0.4974,0.4566,4.7113,2.7084,4.8468,0.3546,1.383,5.6304,3.0057,5.1976,0.0762,1.871,5.8469,0.0005,6.3754,2.8645,5.8342,5.2717,0.835,1.5032,3.0947,1.7532,2.057,3.9232,0.3655,0.6648,13.7694,5.7066,7.4929,3.8436,0.8707,1.4159,6.469,0.731,1.6929,2.2548,0.1303,7.0853,0.0058,0.6569,3.166,1.5112,1.9817,1.8265,6.7212,4.983,1.6728,2.3312,0.6746,2.3395,2.7251,1.1782,4.369,1.772,1.4825,6.8691,0.3144,4.4311,3.5174,6.8544,2.974,0.6723,0.509,3.5554,4.3569,5.5152,3.1076,7.581,0.2097,0.7403,5.2339,7.5997,0.8503,1.0094,0.0691,1.7777,0.1491,0.3534,5.7671,6.7626,0.8754,0.9509,1.3832,4.0001,2.4472,1.276,6.9177,1.5339,3.342,0.1468,1.1143,2.9945,1.3104,3.1244,4.5823,5.0785,3.2655,4.8852,1.4912,3.5596,2.0062,4.8868,5.0584,0.3851,1.2641,3.9088,4.4632,1.1962,0.0986,2.4692,4.5086,1.217,1.4436,2.619,7.1362,6.5077,8.0744,0.1937,0.0811,7.7214,3.0985,3.2454,0.0543,1.161,2.0625,6.2373,4.3133,1.4565,0.1463,0.8809,5.6993,2.7151,1.1155,2.6926,4.4078,5.8208,2.5344,3.3837,1.1595,1.1866,0.3483,0.1138,1.343,5.0113,2.269,0.9276,5.2261,3.2472,3.583,0.8641,2.3731,4.8714,6.5532,2.7194,5.6658,1.2363,1.6087,4.8793,0.0772,5.3958,3.683,3.0656,1.4431,3.4671,0.9147,1.4839,1.8742,3.7883,2.3005,7.8626,1.1262,2.6542,3.3219,2.1672,2.4238,0.0804,1.6467,1.3709,4.9191,4.3433,6.2128,0.0381,0.0645,0.9805,5.3259,2.7234,5.8355,3.8347,4.2623,5.4378,5.2139,1.4441,4.9338,0.1383,1.9594,1.6708,2.0568,4.0171,6.5445,0.0016,3.7247,4.2657,4.0026,6.8232,3.7323,3.637,2.5416,3.1805,5.74,0.8482,5.8583,2.6985,0.5345,0.0666,5.3049,8.1948,1.0541,5.9934,0.0799,0.8577,1.4274,2.8816,4.7485,0.1071,4.994,3.9797,4.44,7.4952,8.6044,7.5193,5.9446,0.0864,9.3455,7.6836,0.5883,6.2527,3.3785,4.4234,7.941,5.0564,0.7811,7.9258,4.0327,5.4671,1.1398,1.3127,3.8299,0.7988,3.8481,4.4514,2.0578,1.675,4.4575,3.9262,4.4526,3.2422,1.3529,1.8097,0.3753,4.6453,0.1212,0.9445,0.4152,1.7027,4.2516,5.0052,0.178,4.9806,2.2626,4.1889,3.0824,0.2241,1.5777,2.9021,3.2841,0.3371,6.7168,4.1282,4.8349,3.5468,2.5851,4.123,2.0899,2.3412,3.5017,4.1287,2.9336,6.7782,6.3705,2.916,0.4187,2.051,5.7295,1.0666,1.6775,0.5507,4.6805,3.7947,1.3686,1.2745,5.3338,1.2728,2.0799,6.0215,2.0563,0.002,5.1356,3.4589,1.2709,1.4024,0.4606,5.0722,0.0032,5.1127,5.993,3.281,3.7709,0.92,0.2069,0.47,3.8457,3.8838,0.0079,6.4535,2.5938,0.2293,2.7579,0.1874,1.3722,6.7591,0.9023,1.5604,4.4784,5.7678,1.4735,2.2783,3.1957,2.8466,0.9845,4.3822,1.9494,4.177,1.2407,3.0826,0.4196,6.7029,0.4676,4.2316,1.4156,1.0554,7.2487,6.5243,8.8057,1.4286,3.0566,1.1575,5.0794,3.8886,1.122,9.3816,1.1068,1.6102,2.5903,2.8931,1.7459,3.123,4.3895,4.5083,1.5581,6.5797,0.9407,5.5963,5.9983,2.9249,0.4865,3.7966,4.7075,2.2498,0.8491,1.6375,2.3535,4.1396,0.1311,3.0272,3.4236,4.0213,5.774,2.8841,3.9967,0.4626,3.0122,4.9292,10.2146,2.9609,0.2195,1.3145,1.8161,3.7684,4.2047,5.8941,0.4674,4.6227,0.5758,3.6971,0.6474,0.6006,1.6801,12.2421,0.0405,0.0006,0.3534,1.9182,0.7028,4.6125,0.9267,2.9526,4.8787,4.2377,1.5316,1.0046,1.999,1.4838,5.6994,0.9207,1.0704,3.2425,1.3238,0.679,0.0633,1.4492,2.2183,3.9178,1.207,9.2047,0.006,0.0048,0.4066,2.0474,2.8416]}
{"prompt":"South Korea s Joint Chiefs of Staff said they presume North Korea fired a Hwasong-14 long-range ballistic missile on Wednesday , the South s Yonhap News Agency reported . A military spokesman told Reuters he","text":"South Korea s Joint Chiefs of Staff said they presume North Korea fired a Hwasong-14 long-range ballistic missile on Wednesday, the South s Yonhap News Agency reported. A military spokesman told Reuters he didn t know the exact nature of the launch. He did not confirm reports of a missile falling in Japan s Tokyo. An official at Seoul s Joint Chiefs of Staff told Yonhap that they can only presume North Korea launched the missile. On Sunday, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested an ultra-powerful intercontinental ballistic missile.\n. But a missile launch is rare. The North typically fires ballistic missiles as a show of force but has not launched such a missile since last year. The North Koreans would never test a weapon with the intent of using it as a nuclear warhead, military experts said. North Korea says it has the capacity to put a nuclear warhead on top of such missiles, making them long-range weapons that can reach any part of the United States mainland. In Seoul Thursday, the government s top intelligence official vowed to continue aggressively pursuing the North.\n. President Lee Myung-bak and Prime Minister Kim Yo Jong vowed to make a joint declaration on the need to completely dismantle North Korea, according to Yonhap. The summit that brings Kim Jong-il and Lee Myung-Bak brings their second face-to-face since October 9. The two leaders said that North Korea must be totally dismantled and that denuclearization is their joint goal, which has been a pillar of the s unification and reconciliation talks. The two leaders signed an agreement that says the two governments want to move toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establish an inter-Korean military demarcation line. They also agreed that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is a key goal of the peace process on the peninsula, according to the joint communique they signed. They pledged to create a new inter-Korean relationship based on trust, good will, openness, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence.\n. It would help if Kim Jong-il and Lee Myung-bak both knew about each other s nuclear ambitions. Lee is one of the few foreign leaders with whom Kim has shown signs of wanting to speak. A year ago after the first summit with the North Korean leader, Lee said on the South Korean PBS television network that although they had not spoken, Kim said nothing that worried him about what his political policies might be. There has never been a better opportunity for the two to open up, said Lee, because of the South Korean elections later this year. But it will take considerable personal effort from both leaders, said a senior South Korean policy expert familiar with the negotiations.

{"prompt":"French President Emmanuel Macron s proposed European reforms will play a big role in talks between German Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives to form a government with the center-left Social Democrats ( SPD ) ,","text":"French President Emmanuel Macron s proposed European reforms will play a big role in talks between German Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives to form a government with the center-left Social Democrats ( SPD ), reports the BBC.\nAs part of proposals made with the intention of boosting economic prosperity and strengthening Europe s security, Macron said he would take responsibility for the introduction of free movement to the United Kingdom after Brexit.\nMerkel s new coalition partner SPD already have shown enthusiasm for free movement in a statement this week, saying that a new law to boost economic growth will be passed in the second half of the year.\nMacron will propose the creation of an insurance fund for Europe s economy in order to deal with economic downturns, according to Macron, and the idea is to establish one in the following weeks.\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk will address the group of 27 leaders at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Sept. 15, but the EU is considering a special summit in October, after it was suggested this could be discussed during a joint session of the parliaments on the theme of economic growth.\nThe new program to strengthen Europe s security is based on Macron s suggestion to launch a European force within the UN military intervention operations, after several such operations have been successfully carried out in places such as Mali, the Middle East.\nThe plan will be discussed the next day in the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries ( G7 ) as part of Macron s proposal to bring together the countries involved in foreign operations like NATO and the EU, not at the level of the European Union s 27 EU countries.\nThe proposal includes a European defense budget of 500 billion euros ($ 587 billion) to create a European military, but the SPD is not enthusiastic about this at this point because it wants to see greater integration in the defense programs of the member states, the report said.\nThe plans will require that each country agrees to the creation of a joint forces within a month of the proposal being made, according to the report, but Paris, Berlin and London have said they are not willing to do this. EU leaders have also said that the plan needs to be accompanied by some form of EU contribution to military programs in the member states.\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire added that after having implemented reforms to boost Europe s competitiveness, the objective was to have the same result at the political level. EU countries must be unified on the defense of the rules and not subject to unilateral decisions, Le Maire told the BBC.\nFrance, Germany and Britain are pushing for a permanent security structure within European Union, but if this is rejected by other countries, it can be handled through the UN. They are talking at an intergovernmental level, but Macron wants to go further and try to make it happen as a United Nations-wide proposal, according to the BBC.","token_len":573,"entropy":[7.6511,4.3085,0.0027,10.0948,9.4554,4.9913,6.3091,5.2178,7.3077,0.554,3.7923,0.2231,0.087,8.8962,1.9565,4.8026,0.1825,0.0017,0.0003,10.6185,5.2603,3.0571,3.2387,0.2175,1.588,3.5162,1.8612,4.2436,0.0513,0.9004,1.8668,0.3901,1.8666,10.7059,1.4648,8.5573,1.7801,3.9582,0.721,0.5089,16.0895,2.7462,0.0016,8.7073,4.378,5.7237,1.407,7.962,0.162,5.0897,2.3412,5.1271,1.8181,4.3552,3.0999,9.4947,4.9389,0.5811,1.9281,2.7639,1.9746,0.8828,4.1515,5.8965,0.0816,1.3284,7.5168,0.0438,4.1256,2.6196,4.4909,1.9473,6.3219,1.2346,3.8796,1.1223,0.4989,0.1868,4.8545,0.0002,3.0107,5.3738,3.8713,1.5958,6.6899,7.2704,4.1292,8.6925,6.8828,0.3369,2.0555,0.19,2.7662,3.1607,4.2983,4.1447,0.2209,1.1632,1.4309,1.6816,3.6276,2.6362,5.0457,3.4736,5.2937,2.2913,1.0405,2.8765,1.7546,4.0466,2.1399,1.2942,4.1424,0.383,0.0052,1.2375,0.1486,0.529,0.1662,3.373,0.0003,3.7061,4.3013,2.5339,3.5668,0.0087,2.3833,7.626,3.7378,1.355,5.4134,1.0521,4.8561,3.4219,1.9422,0.0114,4.7855,0.0128,4.4517,3.6487,0.1198,1.8794,2.9079,0.009,5.539,2.8298,2.7967,2.44,4.0768,1.9117,0.5453,3.8805,4.8324,2.786,1.3678,6.3172,5.6319,0.546,0.2263,6.1164,2.9917,1.5249,0.0984,0.0001,0.0,3.0934,5.0383,0.5452,3.1806,2.9133,4.2859,2.2576,1.5927,0.6682,2.846,1.2844,1.1835,0.7317,0.0001,0.7892,5.6264,0.2977,3.2066,1.3954,3.6012,1.983,2.9943,2.3379,4.7462,1.9036,5.6037,2.9801,2.3111,3.6247,2.4861,3.7752,4.8099,2.478,3.9243,4.4426,4.9712,0.9613,4.9674,2.6721,2.1268,4.7558,2.2594,0.4962,0.4258,7.1805,0.0085,0.0068,3.8884,1.8476,8.1651,0.3554,3.0256,2.1898,0.4664,0.271,1.6919,4.094,7.3733,4.0705,4.1244,2.1351,0.6623,0.5725,2.0963,4.4364,0.0528,5.0764,1.6358,5.5286,2.6223,6.3032,0.7623,2.6577,7.0724,4.5324,1.2784,7.4809,6.9623,6.3058,8.2958,3.5965,4.6081,6.4668,5.3565,3.2996,1.8248,0.8585,5.6196,1.3902,0.0016,1.1279,6.0735,0.821,0.003,3.3125,1.1515,3.7712,3.4332,0.0108,4.4305,0.3193,1.6664,3.5678,2.7414,1.5358,3.5883,7.1128,1.4268,0.9561,1.7015,1.2136,5.9645,0.0238,2.3822,7.9269,4.5214,0.8775,4.192,4.0457,0.1245,1.3562,4.1962,0.8789,0.0009,4.9479,0.8151,2.7432,0.7622,4.1523,1.8241,1.4019,4.0881,2.5133,0.3516,5.8381,4.5099,6.0546,2.5721,1.16,0.8441,2.5734,2.4366,7.2368,6.126,0.5757,4.205,0.0864,1.2584,2.5921,1.0479,5.9172,8.7409,5.1357,3.0005,0.4579,0.3096,1.6218,3.2551,4.2946,1.3924,3.9971,4.8355,1.7208,0.878,5.9914,0.2466,0.1134,1.8814,7.653,5.3047,0.0582,0.4138,2.634,4.7652,1.1548,2.2446,2.6902,4.7263,3.441,2.0833,7.4933,2.2909,2.3789,7.2511,0.1476,2.4635,5.9358,0.9505,2.1588,3.5684,1.2054,3.24,0.5096,3.2675,5.1906,2.6742,2.6858,0.7035,5.0948,8.6775,0.7351,0.694,3.7322,0.2015,2.1063,3.2237,2.3533,0.8675,0.0776,0.2352,1.4112,5.9429,2.3794,4.9553,3.1407,3.2667,2.0596,6.3786,0.659,3.3728,2.8284,0.0217,0.5391,3.6158,5.7824,2.8652,3.1671,5.0517,1.587,1.0648,4.7129,0.9658,2.4263,0.8192,2.8819,0.0069,0.3175,0.3539,2.0658,2.2409,8.1165,3.874,2.1169,0.3996,2.6817,1.7402,2.8704,0.7782,1.9786,1.2969,2.2761,0.0167,2.52,1.0207,1.2149,7.1427,1.5981,1.6578,1.7693,1.629,1.271,1.8732,3.1186,3.8034,0.3026,0.2588,5.6802,0.0627,4.3694,1.7636,0.0013,4.209,6.4411,1.368,6.1195,5.3632,2.4852,1.2118,4.3504,0.1129,0.8596,0.3588,3.8421,4.6321,0.0106,5.3158,0.2391,1.6425,0.0068,6.4924,0.6043,5.512,5.2312,6.5012,4.5636,2.0036,3.4581,4.4394,0.2151,5.4957,0.6803,1.2798,8.1841,2.8836,0.3666,3.9847,1.9049,4.6498,3.8946,4.2751,0.3763,7.2045,0.139,1.2445,6.9697,2.7122,3.3466,3.1565,7.0894,2.6206,0.88,6.1269,1.7989,1.1682,8.116,2.4616,5.8665,5.7981,0.0626,4.5898,2.4791,1.3484,1.1821,0.0028,0.0013,2.1402,1.7624,1.0493,0.4112,0.3315,3.4153,2.7089,1.5594,0.5144,2.3875,1.6144,5.0436,0.5097,1.1677,5.5588,5.6455,5.5697,2.8974,5.1139,0.8687,2.0734,1.931,5.7466,3.4236,1.294,4.396,1.7801,4.6076,2.0394,0.6617,2.0728,4.3729,1.4358,7.5399,2.2659,1.5397,4.065,2.1093,6.3912,1.6123,6.3194,4.5229,3.5295,4.743,1.1542,0.7842,1.9396,1.326,3.736,3.4888,0.5221,4.9735,1.7926,2.0828,5.066,0.1979,3.2775,1.7656,3.977,3.9451,1.4292,7.772,0.441,3.4947,3.6421,5.1121,1.7436,1.7577,0.0041,0.5608,2.4289,0.232]}

On Sunday a military coup will sweep aside the democratic leader in Honduras and install a junta that will rule as Honduras moves to its first democratic election in a decade. If the military is successful, Honduras will become the latest country in the region to have a coup and the first where civilians would step into power during an election that was marred by massive fraud.\nOn Sunday, November 15, 2015, citizens of Honduras overwhelmingly voted to remove President Manuel Zelaya.

In 2008, Honduras had to borrow from foreign nations millions of dollars because Honduras could not obtain financing from any Latin American country.","token_len":575,"entropy":[8.1749,1.7956,5.0731,7.7046,2.3162,3.9338,5.2091,3.7042,6.9033,3.7327,10.7579,14.1293,0.4084,3.7775,3.1204,2.4164,0.001,0.0002,0.0913,3.6647,11.8624,5.7627,0.7318,2.4124,1.012,3.2763,1.7727,6.9542,1.9595,4.4872,0.0406,0.5218,3.2792,12.472,3.6565,6.0799,0.8879,6.8414,6.412,5.148,0.1954,0.4512,11.2778,6.4517,6.9177,1.3639,1.4063,3.2164,3.4407,5.4012,5.6025,5.21,4.2739,1.4439,0.2176,1.6232,1.9462,3.9634,2.9682,1.5884,2.7877,2.7994,1.0141,0.9851,3.4497,9.8524,12.5786,0.0442,0.0029,6.9702,8.7196,4.6077,0.2468,2.0404,0.5492,2.4286,1.7521,4.845,0.0111,0.0008,0.0003,0.0002,2.5361,3.2212,4.178,0.3125,5.5956,0.8121,7.2401,0.0021,3.9657,1.8696,4.1362,0.0428,2.7406,1.6321,3.0919,3.2411,4.8169,2.1105,2.0905,0.7689,6.8129,0.2414,0.8615,5.085,7.3448,2.3133,2.7379,1.8139,0.527,1.9333,0.8109,2.739,1.8566,1.7262,0.0012,0.0018,0.0005,0.0009,1.1728,5.6726,0.8219,7.2507,2.7438,4.7113,0.2449,3.628,1.6482,0.8817,2.8006,0.9259,0.3094,0.3654,2.5877,1.611,0.404,6.4416,9.8366,1.5975,1.3101,7.4721,0.0196,0.2933,0.3847,6.0191,0.0029,0.0044,0.0303,1.0527,7.0542,3.3516,8.9026,2.0074,0.168,1.3878,7.1981,6.0753,6.2157,2.4299,1.5234,7.9977,8.7199,2.1151,3.4771,5.7896,1.2058,2.6795,5.2658,4.4914,6.1892,0.0546,2.7497,2.4898,1.2813,1.4315,6.1437,1.9581,2.9755,4.0366,6.1562,3.4473,0.8735,1.8927,4.9651,0.188,2.285,5.1324,2.5571,2.6231,6.7589,2.8587,6.5202,2.1393,8.1599,0.1018,5.5269,0.4528,0.2439,0.5107,5.6439,1.9225,5.3681,5.6598,1.5794,5.5086,6.485,4.5331,0.6554,3.9846,7.44,4.1645,1.3629,2.0412,6.0122,0.9627,7.7004,0.0019,1.8064,1.3446,2.4012,3.6899,4.4724,4.2615,1.4342,4.446,2.4432,2.2467,1.5983,1.3431,3.1162,0.3851,0.1963,5.4583,1.1898,3.8997,3.1815,2.4514,0.8373,2.802,0.7888,1.3739,0.6029,5.0008,1.0705,0.9544,1.1877,2.4506,0.2578,3.7193,1.5016,4.1824,4.205,2.5235,1.6521,6.0749,7.2191,4.96,6.3587,3.0613,2.0988,5.846,2.7665,0.5565,2.8981,3.4075,5.228,0.0003,0.1164,5.5701,5.9101,1.2481,1.5449,4.6983,2.1433,0.7859,4.0141,3.7241,0.1743,5.3811,0.1943,8.1423,0.817,1.2323,7.996,0.9435,0.7423,3.8391,1.4599,2.312,0.0005,0.0024,2.8387,1.6316,5.8121,1.7204,2.4656,1.41,6.0429,4.7709,0.5349,2.3215,1.8833,3.6837,1.8852,5.5089,9.7584,0.1117,1.7981,0.4014,5.5971,6.1726,4.5552,0.5151,1.5047,0.0433,2.6701,1.0962,2.6782,2.1347,2.753,3.172,5.9127,1.4606,0.044,6.1929,1.4081,1.2028,3.472,4.2936,1.2162,3.0559,0.2486,1.2373,5.2798,6.4536,0.9295,0.0186,0.285,5.3046,4.0091,0.5683,1.7393,0.2288,2.5993,2.5995,10.8097,3.7454,5.9263,9.9643,4.0523,4.2803,4.0339,7.1262,2.734,0.5989,7.2867,8.7921,3.6426,8.2673,1.5297,2.0647,3.2957,3.0658,1.7995,5.3287,4.335,6.4155,1.4794,5.0236,0.6435,1.1146,1.8507,3.2691,1.32,1.4498,5.0653,0.7323,3.6448,0.0347,4.6155,8.363,0.1383,5.7612,6.4225,1.5838,4.4599,0.3291,1.6624,6.7911,1.5497,1.9672,2.2017,9.2954,0.2882,2.8916,3.6493,3.2945,5.748,2.9462,1.5465,2.3476,2.8758,8.1987,6.854,1.1904,9.5524,3.3858,6.5687,0.0008,0.0026,0.0037,0.0072,2.3226,11.8261,3.2031,2.665,3.6354,10.0161,0.313,7.9672,5.5809,6.4022,5.3361,1.4315,0.1233,2.0016,2.6301,2.4038,4.0524,1.148,4.655,2.8619,4.159,2.707,8.0023,3.166,4.5455,0.7054,2.6312,0.9568,2.322,3.7315,1.469,4.3259,6.5419,2.9755,4.9972,2.0162,4.9055,0.1886,6.5086,0.0712,2.3832,1.2392,2.877,1.3742,4.6803,3.8999,4.8331,1.1906,2.5564,0.8021,1.5152,5.5017,1.7111,2.3726,0.8476,4.0402,3.5593,5.6408,1.2679,0.1499,0.0018,0.5349,2.8198,0.0006,0.0013,0.0005,0.0012,1.0918,2.2523,4.5961,5.4264,2.2261,1.1684,1.7262,0.7741,12.017,1.6942,6.7168,3.6406,3.6442,1.3267,1.0831,0.8086,3.4765,1.2283,1.7573,2.9435,2.636,0.5747,3.1021,2.4026,1.2401,0.6872,6.3728,0.0151,5.0684,7.0581,9.1971,6.3606,1.1224,1.6058,3.919,0.0437,0.119,1.6707,5.0575,4.8167,3.2616,2.4362,0.3603,3.6732,1.3347,6.6352,0.08,3.2603,4.0805,5.4808,2.1754,0.4125,3.0741,6.0459,2.9443,0.0024,2.7234,0.4531,5.1464,1.2782,2.8458,2.9364,1.3297,0.2259,0.1455,0.3607,4.8849,0.0349,1.4619,2.8814,3.9369,0.3694,2.8154,1.7293,5.392,2.3791,3.4323,4.5431,3.6613,5.1743,0.1617,0.0251,5.0523,5.614,4.7934,0.1522,5.8646,4.3277,1.6074,3.5782,6.9673,0.0179,0.4665,0.5276]}
{"prompt":"U.S. Senate Republicans unveiled a tax plan on Thursday that differed from the House of Representatives \u2019 version on several key fronts , including how they treat the corporate tax rate , the tax deduction","text":"U.S. Senate Republicans unveiled a tax plan on Thursday that differed from the House of Representatives \u2019 version on several key fronts, including how they treat the corporate tax rate, the tax deduction for state and local taxes.\nOne of the most frequent areas of disagreement has been who is best placed to decide when states have earned enough money to tax.\nThe House bill has pushed this out to state officials who are appointed by the federal government to set tax rates, while the Senate has allowed legislators to do so.\nMany Republicans argue that taxing is easier when a federal standard is already in place, but they say that their plan allows both the states and Congress to set their own standards. In practice, even if a state sets a tax rate higher than the federal rate, as the number of taxpayers in a state grows, the federal government might be able to demand it bring its total taxable income under that standard.\nHouse Bill 1 is a version of the plan first unveiled during the Trump administration when it was one of several attempts to rein in the nation\u2019s rising tax bills.\nThe House bill took the tax policy proposal of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, leaving Congress on the fence as it weighs how to treat corporate tax rates across the nation. A version of the bill included the U.S. Treasury Department with the powers to impose tax changes, which would likely be the case.\nSenate Democrats have pushed for more federal involvement, saying it could mean a national sales tax hike should a state raise its corporate tax. The new bill now requires the Treasury and the IRS to allow members of Congress to rule tax changes are needed, although they would no longer be able to use a law to raise taxes.\nThe bill does not require Congress to consider tax changes that states want to impose, but it does not automatically allow Congress to intervene.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says, \u201d The tax law is already a living law. If we want to pass a tax, we propose a tax.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in an interview with NBC News, say the Senate Republican tax bill is \u201d an effort to take away tax increases that are rightfully being passed by the states under the law. \u201d\nThe Senate proposal would allow Congress to force states to reduce corporate tax rates, while the House bill would keep this decision to state officials. Under the House bill, states would have more discretion to make tax changes.\nIf a state wanted to raise taxes, the bill would require a tax increase to be supported with votes of two-thirds of each chamber, although it would still allow a simple majority of voters to approve a change, with a higher threshold for amendments to the tax code.\nIf a state wanted to lower taxes, it would be forced to have a legislative package that passed with both chambers to approve a tax change.","token_len":575,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6722,4.971,5.9498,0.822,4.3746,1.0946,1.7649,1.626,0.3871,11.5352,0.6109,1.184,2.8245,6.4726,0.004,17.8345,8.0531,9.7223,4.5802,4.5082,1.506,4.2836,1.6351,0.5239,4.1757,3.7221,6.5294,1.6092,5.0051,0.3224,0.4726,1.8995,1.8198,4.0541,4.4858,0.9685,2.3309,0.1059,0.0206,0.902,4.4609,0.3285,18.5979,1.178,0.2182,2.3817,7.0749,5.0011,0.4401,0.8817,3.505,0.3399,5.386,2.9934,4.0158,3.6582,0.0564,4.2631,3.3676,5.8586,4.0131,6.1017,3.2208,2.0018,0.3473,4.791,3.4856,1.2312,7.636,2.0924,2.4034,4.2085,5.9419,6.9553,4.2831,3.4768,4.4659,4.4762,2.9911,2.1627,7.5632,0.318,0.7904,3.8343,0.0303,2.146,4.25,2.8621,0.3813,1.9842,3.3499,0.7624,0.1232,2.6179,4.5244,6.111,0.0882,4.4365,0.9261,0.7615,0.4617,5.1551,2.7968,4.0606,0.2514,5.1021,4.1888,5.973,2.9582,3.4052,5.2254,6.005,0.6363,4.8163,1.1099,0.0343,1.3732,2.2802,3.1974,2.1083,1.3603,5.8647,2.9813,5.0657,6.4041,2.6031,1.4359,0.1926,6.6201,0.1621,2.3939,1.4329,0.0419,3.7048,0.5513,4.9448,4.3603,0.0401,5.98,1.865,2.2395,0.5165,3.2642,1.4329,2.3609,0.1537,3.7474,0.0786,0.7704,0.5374,2.9949,0.1284,6.1419,2.2506,8.3415,0.2343,5.1104,1.4296,1.4961,0.3975,4.2051,0.2254,1.4825,1.5311,2.6919,4.9826,3.0197,0.475,0.0053,6.7402,3.7631,9.5589,3.0207,7.4859,5.3426,0.2111,4.3807,4.2061,0.5599,0.4578,0.1828,4.1815,4.2501,3.661,2.9099,2.4595,4.5623,0.2251,0.8193,4.8793,6.5592,2.6416,4.4196,0.6167,6.1461,0.2862,5.3459,2.0103,0.5021,6.0289,0.1134,2.3988,4.3568,0.5529,5.8022,0.1497,0.7586,3.6237,14.7261,0.406,4.1632,5.8026,2.5045,5.0069,0.2744,0.7909,1.903,1.7153,0.9206,6.584,2.8707,4.7814,5.5078,4.5987,3.1005,2.4107,2.7965,2.6437,0.4424,0.0059,0.0,1.167,9.2745,4.9017,4.8992,2.9278,6.7896,2.6509,3.2309,5.4947,2.6949,0.3885,4.8628,3.261,1.4763,0.3084,4.6824,0.1452,1.8258,0.2751,5.0652,3.4072,0.4998,0.2965,1.261,5.4084,2.953,5.9941,0.0028,0.0018,0.0143,2.9841,0.1768,6.1442,1.6177,5.6304,0.2067,2.1326,3.0998,4.2117,2.0017,3.0566,1.83,4.2394,1.758,3.7749,3.0704,3.7485,0.3736,3.2981,2.971,1.8133,3.6441,1.5651,2.5678,5.3868,2.8884,1.8861,2.4436,2.1412,2.6844,4.6116,2.9023,4.8368,4.196,0.0154,5.3235,6.9757,2.5174,0.9948,2.7766,1.1528,2.3764,0.5384,4.5942,2.5848,5.308,1.5482,5.8287,4.4204,1.4387,2.0924,5.6866,1.0504,2.7622,0.044,6.4809,7.0054,0.2477,0.5304,0.2044,6.8013,8.6366,1.894,3.841,3.5487,2.3795,4.3103,2.3851,2.2682,6.2436,0.0759,0.7423,1.5159,0.0198,4.1094,3.8717,5.2663,1.5419,3.4547,1.2885,1.0816,0.217,1.8925,2.5373,3.7917,0.3311,2.8214,2.7685,0.0508,4.3911,4.0685,0.5012,2.629,8.2315,4.6642,0.4836,2.1456,1.3751,1.1765,1.1172,1.104,4.1042,6.9996,3.2041,2.9747,0.0431,6.5236,0.9959,0.642,2.8725,2.1138,0.3795,0.0619,0.0006,6.1597,5.1629,11.1087,7.9054,5.0876,3.487,4.7247,1.4484,3.7962,4.1714,5.7081,3.7565,1.527,3.4243,2.6196,2.4624,0.3438,4.4473,1.2717,1.4174,4.3909,0.5025,8.2183,1.9502,2.0618,1.9673,3.4114,3.9779,2.631,0.0948,0.2326,0.0005,6.0682,2.4381,0.3037,0.7573,3.333,0.6324,2.994,7.6973,2.2529,2.1314,5.0669,2.0644,1.4914,1.4267,11.2905,0.7763,3.1879,2.7665,0.1391,4.3355,1.3053,4.4559,4.9188,1.8061,2.2716,8.8665,3.2519,2.4617,1.1781,1.0461,0.3343,5.4279,0.6835,3.9766,0.3951,6.052,0.1782,0.6477,2.0884,1.7995,4.2833,2.0756,2.2725,3.5929,0.0571,5.2486,0.6751,0.1049,4.2375,3.8205,0.9715,0.0287,2.0471,2.8775,2.5629,0.2253,1.7296,0.3636,5.8597,6.118,5.1507,0.9809,3.5926,2.1145,0.52,5.9683,0.4637,1.2653,1.1334,0.0528,1.0905,0.7659,1.3219,4.3816,3.6609,1.0277,3.9891,2.0964,0.4252,1.8029,0.3602,4.2222,1.9093,0.175,5.2405,0.0966,1.7711,2.1123,1.1589,1.841,3.4929,0.255,2.118,2.5159,4.1461,0.6237,2.9356,1.3094,7.3636,5.4154,5.435,2.024,5.1111,0.1186,0.0066,0.3747,5.302,0.7398,1.8952,5.0348,2.0032,0.6282,2.401,3.2611,2.6126,4.439,0.5706,1.6174,5.72,0.3678,2.1323,1.479,1.3391,3.3908,4.0772,1.6786,7.3482,1.4069,1.5725,7.1133,2.9301,1.3649,1.8181,0.8685,0.4094,0.3499,3.4076,0.969,0.1705,0.9041,0.0525,3.1983,1.4249,0.2561,2.3719,0.2376,3.1044,3.9371,0.054,5.8403,0.978,4.7176,5.485,1.2213,4.4279,1.8311,4.712,1.3182,4.6958,3.9757,1.919,1.7583,2.0239,0.7266]}

civilians as well as combatants \".\nEarlier on Sunday, the ICRC, together with the Yemen chapter of the Red Cross, announced the distribution of emergency food supplies to some 500 families left homeless after an attack on their homes by rebels in the capital Sanaa on Saturday.\nThe group said the food supplies were dispatched following the death of 20 people from a hunger strike in Aden last week.","token_len":575,"entropy":[4.0956,4.2798,10.6944,12.1902,4.5422,4.91,2.0917,1.0637,2.3083,11.4458,7.0615,2.6461,5.7874,7.5961,4.2801,3.3157,0.0006,5.6303,3.4251,1.372,8.8108,0.4423,2.5785,0.9527,1.1421,3.2247,0.7974,1.0733,2.0032,3.8622,0.6501,0.0253,0.0002,0.0,0.0001,0.4606,0.948,2.2263,0.145,0.2572,13.5067,4.1231,0.1232,3.8894,0.2386,2.7413,5.3292,3.7667,3.141,1.9263,2.3695,2.8227,0.034,6.1644,1.6245,4.5362,3.4389,0.0015,1.5224,0.987,0.7017,2.0712,4.9088,0.0589,3.8754,3.7189,1.957,0.2176,0.5938,1.2527,0.1709,1.3948,8.8901,1.656,1.0267,4.0126,3.3039,5.0617,1.8149,1.0889,1.0048,2.8863,0.5648,0.8425,1.4064,1.5189,2.3113,2.9868,0.505,3.4772,2.1026,7.5335,0.0317,0.8976,1.2028,3.0522,0.2167,0.3006,0.2509,3.7227,0.9546,1.6213,6.054,3.1033,5.9755,4.4649,1.4937,5.1947,1.9376,1.4006,2.9422,5.2249,0.6988,4.6174,0.2308,0.9923,2.353,3.0236,4.0675,4.2324,2.2206,2.6849,3.1242,2.2188,2.238,2.4135,5.1087,1.8944,1.3137,4.9428,0.6634,0.3933,1.0617,1.9597,0.4597,1.3377,3.3227,1.2178,5.3156,1.2669,2.1354,0.4348,0.8381,6.1721,0.9916,2.5078,0.1725,6.8899,4.0389,4.3405,0.6327,1.3744,5.5733,1.03,2.2475,2.3376,0.278,4.9295,5.0312,0.0011,1.429,3.9862,0.8655,1.4281,0.0003,0.0003,0.0011,1.3131,0.6892,0.9184,0.1118,0.1033,0.2115,7.338,1.7116,1.5976,0.797,0.3413,1.1618,4.1437,1.9564,0.4072,3.717,4.3034,1.538,1.3322,1.3763,3.1266,0.1866,6.7166,3.3384,0.0427,1.8471,0.6089,1.4943,1.8133,1.718,1.5593,0.4219,4.6268,0.8588,0.255,1.6633,5.0779,0.0061,1.4333,7.0529,2.3248,6.644,1.1656,0.004,2.9262,3.4475,0.0009,4.9503,0.8617,1.3113,2.3287,0.0841,0.2777,0.3646,1.2555,6.0355,0.001,0.4924,5.5845,5.1283,1.8477,4.199,0.87,0.8356,3.7932,0.8218,3.9581,7.3852,2.7379,0.1043,1.3747,4.7387,1.817,0.2939,1.5607,0.5684,2.0199,0.0622,1.1877,2.9893,0.0033,0.9286,1.166,0.7555,0.37,1.1809,4.4351,0.0088,2.7741,7.5495,2.9764,2.4415,0.0581,0.093,1.2699,2.4227,5.3814,3.7193,0.6383,1.8401,0.3723,1.0841,4.0443,5.8948,0.1143,4.4371,3.1641,0.566,3.5197,3.2759,0.0014,4.578,1.0435,3.4026,1.8399,0.0709,1.3392,4.5158,2.3337,4.4689,2.0644,0.8644,0.3688,5.8372,0.3275,0.4668,0.0925,4.5071,1.7429,0.3673,0.1769,0.7799,4.5087,3.4326,2.2251,0.4094,4.3362,1.1574,4.0333,0.4676,1.2589,7.1217,3.3133,0.2496,2.4199,0.0038,1.6866,0.4306,1.0279,3.4184,0.2813,3.9021,1.2869,0.4132,4.0296,0.4503,2.6971,3.6807,0.9919,1.3129,4.0746,1.0505,0.0065,1.7996,1.6222,0.3651,1.2484,1.7652,0.0008,0.3489,2.2745,4.041,1.5654,1.3811,4.3126,4.7033,0.2342,0.5009,0.2247,1.519,5.0614,1.4575,6.9673,0.2528,3.9275,3.4164,0.1368,2.9451,1.1423,0.2229,2.9954,0.6602,0.5171,1.432,5.9728,0.007,0.5442,2.2255,1.9657,0.1371,1.6598,3.6255,1.2038,0.8781,0.858,3.3827,4.1651,2.8988,0.0048,1.4528,3.0038,0.8801,4.2086,5.8603,2.7291,0.5985,4.1986,9.5156,0.8236,3.2886,2.4984,1.8569,7.2017,3.281,0.0042,3.5131,3.2724,3.9307,3.7491,7.3854,0.0057,3.1197,2.5429,0.403,4.3311,5.7449,4.3578,0.1194,0.0992,1.1018,0.387,1.1747,3.6211,4.0224,0.4049,4.6961,2.6062,0.4184,2.9867,0.9489,4.7956,0.9146,3.8121,0.73,2.3369,0.0072,3.1618,3.6655,1.9351,0.7933,5.1729,1.3617,1.0215,1.0519,2.529,2.47,1.5829,1.2926,0.7525,0.4191,1.2354,4.2481,0.5449,0.0103,0.0052,0.0003,0.0016,0.8186,1.7659,6.4347,0.3194,4.2063,6.9254,0.5584,0.9939,0.5765,0.2516,3.6749,1.4664,3.6289,1.7901,0.9524,0.4473,1.786,4.3433,2.0334,1.1399,1.3915,2.7336,4.3337,7.1322,7.4847,6.5247,7.7301,7.5333,5.3609,7.0634,7.3978,2.8604,5.4155,0.2634,0.5133,3.8334,1.171,0.7343,3.1031,4.3974,2.1511,2.7899,2.5279,8.531,4.9145,3.8395,0.4866,1.5623,2.058,4.8225,0.2751,7.4216,3.8702,3.9259,0.0092,0.0372,1.4319,8.0263,0.3973,5.832,1.1892,0.3979,0.0716,1.1691,1.4632,0.0012,5.1926,6.4285,0.0001,0.7375,5.2568,8.2018,0.064,0.3877,3.0974,0.0408,0.2944,3.3345,2.0149,5.5994,0.0386,4.6712,2.404,2.3716,0.7569,4.8367,4.3206,2.9999,6.5933,3.4626,2.9296,3.456,1.7466,0.9743,2.2909,0.9986,1.5076,2.0819,1.1844,0.4613,3.1556,1.0222,0.0029,0.7803,1.1543,0.2619,0.2713,1.0287,3.0692,0.5314,1.7596,2.8593,3.2326,1.274,7.8843,5.5639,1.7286,3.1077,0.0724,5.3733,1.811,4.1932,1.4969,6.0891,0.019,1.3582,3.5664,2.4757,0.5523,0.3885]}
{"prompt":"Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives will delay the release of tax legislation for a day as lawmakers try to overcome differences involving the treatment of retirement savings accounts and state and local taxes","text":"Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives will delay the release of tax legislation for a day as lawmakers try to overcome differences involving the treatment of retirement savings accounts and state and local taxes.\nThe Republican leaders on the House Ways and Means Rules Committee will delay a vote on an agreed-upon tax bill that would be sent to the full House and the Senate on Tuesday morning, a House official said.\nA House official last week said a deal had been reached but it did not end an effort by Republicans and Democrats that had begun Sunday to reach a tax overhaul before the mid-term election.\nMembers disagreed on how to reconcile differences between the tax code and the legislation that would implement Obama's landmark healthcare law as well as his plan to increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $7.50 per hour this year.\nThe agreement involves a repeal of the so-called \"tax cap\" that limits tax provisions that reduce state and local tax liability for corporate investment, rather than leaving this type of tax treatment intact along with the rest of the tax code.\nA member of the Senate tax hawk's faction, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, said Monday that the House Republican majority is not moving as fast as it should.\nThe Ways and Means bill would also increase the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 39 percent for those with incomes above $1 million combined with an increase in the tax rate on businesses from 21 percent to 28 percent under a so-called \"sanctity clause\" that has been in the proposal for more than a year.\nThe measure also would expand the definition of \"corporation\" to include partnerships, allowing more companies to be exempted from taxes.\nHouse Ways and Means Rep. Mike Miller, who had been pushing for the tax rules to be repealed, said in a statement Monday that the bill \"is in great shape and we strongly encourage the RNC to take the measure out on Wednesday and send it to Congress.\"\nSome lawmakers have been saying they want the Tax Relief Relief Act, which would repeal the tax cap, extended through the 2013 legislative session.\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in an op-ed Sunday in the Washington Post: \"I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate to consider carefully whether it would be in the national interest to send the House Republican tax bill to the election on a deadline so long in advance that legislators simply don't have the time to put it to a complete test in the House.\"\nThe full House should also vote on the legislation, but to do that would require a bipartisan agreement on tax changes before election day.\nA source said no deal had been reached. In the mean time, Republicans would hold another House Rules Committee meeting Monday.","token_len":575,"entropy":[3.6707,1.4879,4.1883,0.0016,0.0422,0.1786,1.2853,0.6823,0.0027,4.0979,9.4044,1.4559,4.6223,0.047,5.6551,5.83,1.9575,2.5476,4.3887,3.8407,2.7442,2.6618,0.0265,5.5131,4.2913,9.3834,1.4825,7.6065,0.0291,6.6047,2.4979,1.575,0.8324,4.7249,1.281,0.135,1.2029,0.3763,0.3014,15.1371,4.3571,2.944,4.0668,0.9776,0.3198,0.6492,0.0162,0.0001,10.0411,0.1223,2.8356,4.0405,2.1758,1.1122,0.4758,4.0428,8.0697,0.4151,0.0545,1.5941,0.6684,3.4484,1.1169,4.6952,4.0305,0.2055,1.0729,2.792,0.5134,3.2635,3.2058,0.0492,2.6188,2.1635,4.0972,1.7669,2.9031,2.8334,2.9555,0.2016,0.5577,0.3158,3.6976,2.0532,3.2243,8.9002,0.2924,0.6506,3.2759,3.7581,2.7889,0.2278,0.1298,2.2735,3.0611,3.9893,0.005,5.8053,4.8446,2.9352,1.4713,1.8566,3.7866,0.65,5.4547,3.7857,4.2108,6.733,0.5075,3.2215,0.6244,6.1486,4.0027,2.9667,0.9434,5.8619,0.8269,1.0641,2.2091,0.4369,0.269,6.5473,10.4299,1.3217,1.9224,0.6234,3.9255,4.1651,1.6525,0.901,2.3914,2.3667,0.4222,1.0018,4.4996,1.7279,1.1456,7.3526,6.7119,0.315,3.4471,3.7614,0.6109,5.1375,1.5376,0.0123,5.8285,3.5097,0.1738,4.0461,1.1798,1.7529,1.4697,0.0109,3.8569,0.0613,0.3146,0.0388,0.028,1.236,0.0051,4.0653,0.0636,3.8445,2.1738,0.0021,6.4794,0.1268,0.3514,0.3101,1.57,4.2194,6.2407,1.5613,5.688,0.1671,0.7952,4.8255,0.0008,0.0006,2.4873,6.3003,6.3524,0.5508,1.2283,5.0698,3.8134,6.9923,2.0852,4.414,4.4461,0.1278,0.01,1.6271,5.6798,1.496,4.8039,7.1955,2.5781,5.9399,0.0023,6.1351,8.033,5.7616,0.003,1.576,5.9935,2.1,8.0726,0.1549,1.9212,4.0643,0.0461,0.1895,1.4675,0.1189,0.2849,0.3513,3.9534,6.3062,0.0915,0.2417,3.7596,2.5373,11.0366,4.0015,8.0219,1.2975,1.055,0.001,4.4424,0.5654,0.0001,0.0,1.3964,0.1112,0.0977,0.863,3.455,0.5621,1.2398,2.4892,5.8417,5.9326,3.049,3.023,4.6556,4.058,1.1021,0.225,2.8465,1.4098,1.6056,0.2727,2.5901,5.5798,0.0016,0.0003,4.6414,1.6335,3.365,4.1966,0.5592,2.0651,2.8202,0.0567,0.7452,0.8282,0.6767,0.223,0.068,2.1567,4.7779,2.5893,2.4048,3.6156,1.1789,2.0881,0.1125,2.7262,0.1285,9.4944,4.0936,3.0053,1.1424,1.0941,0.373,4.0207,0.844,1.4069,3.851,5.7562,4.537,0.3169,0.0362,2.0831,0.1142,6.4518,2.3859,5.6161,0.0012,0.0005,1.0997,7.8677,2.8067,0.3603,3.975,0.911,0.8776,4.7737,0.7721,1.3639,3.2004,5.7636,1.0971,2.2582,0.0009,0.638,0.2195,0.1911,0.3364,1.5428,2.7431,2.564,0.5749,4.2111,0.7347,3.3492,0.0129,1.611,5.0095,1.1365,0.2555,0.5523,0.7825,0.1616,3.9124,0.9248,8.1428,4.4163,2.9628,0.2587,3.0903,4.3858,0.1692,3.2319,2.151,0.5441,2.9893,1.8172,0.0038,0.0003,5.2439,0.0014,3.3311,5.0362,0.5914,4.1938,4.8367,1.8131,2.3271,0.7048,1.1746,1.3125,6.6693,1.466,0.5455,3.5582,0.5884,0.5304,3.6198,0.3161,0.3833,1.5252,0.364,1.3102,3.3416,2.0739,2.0096,4.7639,5.0597,0.6785,1.2603,3.1636,7.8258,3.7213,1.4828,11.6315,0.4062,3.1976,2.0115,7.2625,5.2454,4.7072,4.256,2.768,4.1412,0.1026,0.3222,4.6247,1.4255,0.134,4.8626,2.7192,2.032,2.7016,4.9461,1.8396,2.4827,1.3298,5.9823,5.8131,8.5728,0.63,1.9029,1.4579,0.7821,4.0117,0.7689,2.0598,4.4613,0.6271,4.5,3.26,1.6906,5.2251,2.9175,0.0632,0.4733,1.0271,5.0371,0.0255,2.8392,1.2873,0.0002,1.2218,0.0017,0.5683,3.0938,0.0038,0.0155,0.3263,0.151,0.0377,0.1259,0.6017,2.313,2.3177,5.346,0.0008,0.0003,3.3468,2.7807,0.7812,1.3862,0.2896,5.7036,0.1082,2.0787,4.9854,1.9006,2.9325,0.0843,2.5528,1.1754,0.1727,0.2579,0.1957,0.0146,4.6477,1.0262,0.9194,0.9569,2.1755,0.0035,0.0958,4.4569,6.5203,3.3177,4.2126,3.1609,0.2253,2.0293,0.3833,3.0987,0.0586,0.6332,4.8308,1.1565,3.718,6.1297,1.0647,0.6426,0.614,0.3522,10.9401,3.5245,2.3695,5.704,4.047,4.0724,5.9227,0.6653,1.133,7.5708,7.3991,2.4309,0.0007,0.4765,1.3022,1.0547,0.4992,4.3869,0.9041,1.6919,0.5736,9.0199,6.4361,3.402,0.9183,2.3871,1.3265,0.1185,1.7681,6.0792,0.5066,5.6413,3.7761,2.3711,0.471,0.6813,3.2202,2.5385,3.557,4.8902,1.4353,4.399,2.1854,0.8929,1.155,5.708,1.6123,2.0747,3.6399,4.1358,3.4172,9.6989,0.1315,0.4771,0.531,4.0949,4.4183,3.0815,5.1824,2.2036,1.3259,0.1098,0.1115,2.0346,5.3454,1.7183,7.5753,0.007,0.0457,3.0989,3.5532,3.8051,4.5373,5.8541,7.8884,0.2443,1.3896,2.4349,2.75]}
{"prompt":"Britain s opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned Morgan Stanley that bankers are right to regard him as a threat because he wants to transform what he cast as a rigged economy that profits speculators","text":"Britain s opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned Morgan Stanley that bankers are right to regard him as a threat because he wants to transform what he cast as a rigged economy that profits speculators at the expense of ordinary Britons. He also threatened to set up his own financial institution if investors keep pulling out of this one. Morgan Stanley has also started to close down offices in the United Kindom including one in Manchester. He also launched a campaign to encourage the banks to close their branches here if they can not earn profit.\nHowever, the banks argue they are very profitable and should therefore keep the money invested here.\nIn an interview on Radio 4 the BBC, Mark Carney the Governor of the Bank of England, the UK s central banker revealed that he personally paid some 1 8 million pounds to the FTSE for the FTSE being in his name. The FTSE is a benchmark in the global market and also covers the banks. Bankers say it can be profitable not to invest in Britain. Mark Carney also admitted that the UK was not doing as well as it should be. The Bank of England is responsible for keeping interest rates low so businesses can borrow cheap money and put their money into investment. Mark Carney admitted that when the bank raised the interest rates for investment, some investors started to pull out.\nWhat Mr Carney said, however, is that Britain s banks still have many investment opportunities. British banks want the US to become the biggest bank in the world and he himself wants to be its top banker. When asked why he wanted to be in the US he said that he loved the United States. He said his job as a banker was not all about making money.\nLast year the Bank of Britain took 3 billion pounds off its balance sheet. For several years, investors in banks around the world have been paying huge sums for the banks to be named on the FTSE. When the Bank of England raises its interest rates banks will be able to earn more money and get their investment back. The Bank of Russia, the Czech Republic, Greece and Finland have all been forced to leave the FTSE. The Bank of London, the UK s main central bank, says the FTSE has become irrelevant since more than three quarters of the companies on this index are British or foreign bank subsidiaries.\nThe FTSE contains only six banks that are not UK-owned. British banks are under attack in Washington and London. The International Monetary Fund says that bank profits have declined and they want more borrowing from Europe to invest in the US economy. Britain, which has tried to maintain its own financial independence, must now be seen to be following the US and its monetary policies. Mr Carney believes it has not done enough to support the US economy. This is why some people think that the US economy will suffer the most even though it s the strongest.","token_len":576,"entropy":[8.1133,9.3616,4.9821,3.6252,0.3305,0.0002,8.5661,15.6309,0.9644,0.8539,7.4908,5.9951,14.6291,0.0019,9.6065,7.6276,1.7672,0.4917,9.1415,8.1905,0.1255,5.6109,0.3999,11.8998,10.1589,0.7888,10.5984,0.0633,1.1517,6.4097,1.7009,7.2263,7.9988,10.8823,0.0157,1.2893,0.7447,0.1148,0.0012,1.5944,3.7188,0.1429,3.5224,2.0025,4.4653,0.319,6.2441,0.6763,4.5638,0.0456,3.9278,4.1089,1.7655,9.3543,8.1117,5.6958,1.8054,1.0581,5.366,5.6222,0.3837,5.4087,0.3955,2.3585,3.1842,6.289,1.567,5.2285,1.7223,4.7441,0.6139,2.2876,2.7056,14.8197,7.9037,8.5247,1.7883,0.5583,4.21,1.0036,4.4485,2.561,4.7694,0.6337,2.479,0.7972,5.2081,2.8747,4.8944,0.2386,2.8712,2.3389,3.0315,6.5827,5.1845,0.9928,3.3473,4.2752,7.3503,3.5607,0.761,1.0758,11.2451,0.302,2.0646,4.635,5.4267,2.6277,1.4906,6.4282,3.6995,1.9161,4.1418,5.6919,3.2769,2.814,2.3618,5.2503,2.2903,0.5675,1.4418,3.4671,2.6384,0.8765,3.0787,4.2281,0.4087,5.6757,4.09,4.9038,4.335,0.8246,7.6847,1.5325,0.2675,0.0856,0.0095,0.0354,0.003,2.2486,5.8032,3.6069,11.9424,4.4889,1.21,7.0078,0.5182,1.7604,5.9683,3.793,4.8112,4.3115,11.2208,3.4949,0.1129,1.1161,1.9212,5.1944,0.1222,0.0176,7.7013,1.6407,4.481,1.0,0.0111,8.5332,4.1897,4.7705,2.8494,0.7607,2.2539,2.0823,0.0096,0.001,1.6583,1.5394,4.7486,3.9977,0.9964,2.9881,3.6515,2.6549,4.937,5.2468,1.8639,5.8953,1.8202,5.6323,2.1071,2.8285,2.2804,4.3713,1.4638,3.2896,5.2584,1.5402,2.3622,0.8998,4.084,1.6434,5.5484,0.1663,2.6168,3.792,0.4835,1.6977,2.8457,2.9304,2.2188,3.2615,2.7912,0.2173,0.2404,0.823,0.4152,2.2058,1.2952,2.9937,1.3241,0.3123,0.0356,2.5204,4.294,0.0209,4.2905,2.6593,0.1256,0.8029,4.1921,6.4227,0.993,3.1351,6.0614,2.3838,1.8483,5.5319,2.4956,0.8689,1.0471,3.9824,2.4976,4.4834,0.0711,4.5607,0.4924,4.9057,1.6067,4.2212,4.4863,2.2863,2.1428,1.3587,4.0257,4.9692,2.0231,4.737,3.4735,4.0337,0.8986,2.462,0.0451,1.1927,1.352,5.2636,5.8592,0.2293,0.9588,4.0705,3.2381,0.0894,1.2124,0.5165,4.8761,7.0343,2.8606,5.1245,1.9449,4.8015,5.6157,2.2068,1.4499,6.6804,0.7399,5.9035,3.2556,5.9954,1.1418,4.2144,0.9696,3.5288,3.8987,0.6155,0.0587,0.0429,1.4397,5.3954,6.789,2.8074,1.1267,3.0225,4.8678,4.2475,1.2511,0.2997,4.9288,1.9775,2.8673,0.9594,3.4067,0.4704,1.8635,2.9399,0.9815,3.3199,2.0043,0.4759,1.5637,1.1814,6.4806,0.9372,2.9697,0.0267,1.4604,1.5111,1.0305,4.4111,3.4621,2.7319,1.4126,1.2748,0.8007,3.4081,7.2515,0.857,2.9911,0.4593,1.5325,2.0411,6.2162,1.4007,1.9218,1.3164,0.0835,6.0848,5.3935,6.5748,2.6145,0.6149,3.7941,1.7677,1.0172,0.104,1.2212,5.8285,6.2655,0.6363,2.0935,5.2184,2.8222,4.4482,2.8687,0.0099,0.0667,1.0145,0.786,3.8527,3.5754,0.9096,1.7858,1.6459,3.3698,1.0495,3.4234,7.4461,4.557,1.0527,2.2176,0.0108,0.0009,0.96,4.119,1.3124,1.6963,0.1969,0.1096,4.326,2.4554,1.188,0.5905,7.4186,2.1615,1.6792,1.9306,0.026,4.821,1.9242,0.823,2.316,3.7934,3.1382,3.7016,1.7339,0.4571,2.2153,1.3947,0.1915,9.9199,2.3372,1.7788,5.065,0.0183,0.9174,3.2269,0.6379,5.1678,1.4586,0.8046,1.895,5.1134,0.2039,5.8711,0.6632,1.22,0.0041,0.0004,0.9639,1.9352,1.4326,0.0558,8.0185,2.0692,0.9511,1.516,1.2861,3.2411,4.9543,0.2679,0.2886,3.7021,2.9015,1.7736,0.0038,0.0004,2.533,3.5695,5.7283,3.6792,7.0897,1.6444,4.0507,1.4066,0.0906,1.3974,4.8056,3.5589,4.3687,2.6184,1.4986,4.7009,4.3602,3.7098,5.1084,4.6476,0.2118,1.2272,1.8147,2.3669,0.0122,0.0006,8.1477,4.1343,5.2325,2.8477,2.8445,1.3743,3.1041,2.9699,3.331,1.3532,0.5685,5.2675,0.6368,1.8862,5.4201,5.8517,3.2688,6.3292,1.7341,1.9232,1.12,1.6561,5.1854,0.0527,0.0008,2.5738,1.3088,6.7649,1.657,2.359,3.3617,3.91,3.8854,5.019,3.8828,6.4921,2.085,4.6607,2.1188,5.6771,0.4342,1.2405,2.2433,2.667,0.1676,4.4996,4.068,2.3655,1.2394,6.7955,0.2694,4.7862,1.0293,3.3908,2.6277,2.7771,0.9043,5.3644,2.6885,3.2167,3.1682,1.2766,0.3473,6.1899,0.9812,2.6885,3.1005,2.1407,5.523,1.1026,0.4907,3.9845,0.1723,5.4819,3.6502,3.478,3.8677,2.1694,0.6265,0.3418,4.5372,0.8981,2.7583,1.1985,1.021,4.6828,1.046,1.8557,5.2542,3.3414,2.2858,1.0918,1.0361,2.0068,3.8485,3.2874,3.0296,4.0373,2.6445,6.0146,1.9445,1.2728,9.6461,2.9547,3.862,2.5131]}
{"prompt":"The 193-member United Nations General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states on U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel","text":"The 193-member United Nations General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states on U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, with a potential boycott if it fails to pass a joint resolution condemning the move.\nThe meeting comes after Trump acknowledged the city as Israel s capital last week and sent a letter to Iran expressing hope of peace between the two countries. On Monday the United Nations General Assembly adopted a statement recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital, and other nations such as the United Kingdom and Japan supported it.\nThe request letter was submitted by the Permanent Observer of Palestine, Riyad Mansour, who said it was supported by Arab and Muslim nations. Mansour made it clear that any action that does not support the statement would be considered a vote of disavowal of the organization s authority over Jerusalem.\nTrump, who also called Jerusalem Israel s capital, has repeatedly stated he was not bound by the UN vote.\nPalestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Malki said Trump was sowing discord between the Palestinians and Israel, warning he was trying to turn the United Nations into a tool against the Palestinians.\nWhile many Muslims consider Jerusalem a holy city, and many American Muslims would rather have Jerusalem recognized as a Palestinian capital instead of Israel s, they do not like Trump s policy.\nMany states including Pennsylvania have already asked that their states not recognize Jerusalem as capital of Israel.\nThe U.S. Senate on Monday approved a Republican resolution to condemn the recognition of Jerusalem and boycott companies that work with Israeli entities or with Israeli companies that support Israel.\nHowever, while the majority of the American public opposes the recognition of Jerusalem by Israel, public opinion polls conducted in the United States show support for a vote that rejects or condemns the move by Trump.\nThe decision to have a joint vote came amid threats from Trump s spokesman to boycott the United Nations as a result of the vote, and the request will be considered unless it is condemned, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.\nThe UN is the only international organization that doesn t recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\nHamas and several Palestinian groups on Wednesday declared a state of emergency in the occupied West Bank as a reaction to the Trump administration s decision to put Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, leading to fears that its decision could lead to further unrest in the Gaza Strip.\nTensions have soared already due to the ongoing crisis between Hamas and Fatah factions that ruled Palestinian territory before Hamas took over in June of 2006, leading to sporadic bloodshed.\nJERUSALEM \u2014 With no clear outcome to a stalemate that has seen Israel\u2019s military blockade unleashed against the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials say it\u2019s up to the United States to resolve the matter.","token_len":576,"entropy":[12.2811,0.9949,1.7126,4.0825,0.2663,2.9088,0.0003,2.6337,3.3094,1.0606,6.2226,5.1963,6.7696,0.0881,0.6192,2.6707,4.8697,1.8491,3.7751,0.0068,6.5233,2.6325,0.6865,3.0328,4.5806,8.2079,0.0009,2.8336,0.2824,2.9596,0.4101,0.0048,10.7057,3.3091,0.1811,2.6568,0.0774,0.0388,1.4446,9.9959,0.0511,2.27,4.4626,2.12,5.9715,9.1492,4.2899,1.7619,3.0233,0.7673,3.0482,3.4184,6.883,0.0588,3.0122,0.8849,2.2006,0.284,0.6675,13.4086,3.7086,2.6164,1.7679,1.8584,7.3155,2.4403,5.2811,2.2705,0.5826,0.9019,0.0431,2.7996,0.6476,1.7885,5.4993,0.7437,1.4581,0.2884,4.8057,6.1819,2.8947,2.6615,3.8551,3.3728,0.5145,0.2068,0.7789,0.4712,5.243,1.9057,3.5221,1.8713,1.0773,1.6705,0.0006,2.8595,0.4471,5.3572,4.7366,0.1663,0.1195,0.9296,0.1988,0.0217,1.1772,2.58,5.5979,2.9514,5.5635,0.002,2.5022,0.5575,1.4541,1.2796,5.185,5.3557,1.9541,0.3611,0.2783,1.6645,7.9497,7.6385,2.6669,4.5601,1.5387,1.4733,6.1984,4.0693,2.4226,3.6164,0.8857,6.5797,0.0008,0.2405,0.0497,0.5146,1.4872,2.578,2.7932,0.9597,7.1225,0.115,2.6629,0.9135,0.1069,2.528,1.4213,4.5849,0.0015,5.5222,2.9016,0.0582,0.4447,4.5788,4.112,2.8535,3.3282,0.0401,3.3472,0.6688,4.8165,1.6579,0.8563,1.7999,1.3498,5.4123,0.9488,11.3774,0.1444,0.0829,2.0434,0.7654,5.1288,8.7788,5.5772,3.2582,3.2295,0.3896,0.2478,3.0973,3.1207,0.7485,4.2017,2.903,3.7786,4.738,0.9112,0.0503,1.4709,1.919,2.7857,3.4273,1.9416,4.3948,1.6425,5.7035,0.0975,1.1369,2.5719,5.5536,1.2899,1.0734,4.3619,4.4461,0.056,0.2945,0.0002,3.9293,0.33,0.7481,0.888,0.1623,0.8901,3.0321,2.7636,8.098,1.4102,1.7893,1.9676,0.7219,3.9522,0.1213,1.6857,2.1354,5.4842,3.8764,1.9698,3.8646,0.0307,5.6214,0.7785,2.2384,1.8933,0.2532,0.5269,3.6279,3.6886,0.9585,1.631,0.5392,0.4259,6.1306,4.3508,4.999,3.6366,0.4953,1.9915,0.9022,1.1683,0.5233,3.7691,1.8539,5.9887,0.9868,5.4017,2.3265,2.9836,3.8937,6.1679,0.4718,2.2891,2.6379,1.8628,5.8193,0.4799,2.8644,0.9835,1.5281,4.2865,2.9404,0.0739,3.8827,1.4991,0.9294,3.8712,0.9382,0.5105,5.126,6.9,4.0321,5.9127,3.0831,2.5672,3.7149,3.6577,3.0584,2.0922,4.4464,0.6803,0.2633,0.2464,4.7274,0.1852,0.8132,1.4646,0.8921,2.0943,2.6437,0.0017,0.1704,0.0907,4.9135,1.8043,1.5887,1.9947,0.5749,7.0859,1.5785,2.2245,3.8414,0.7918,4.2197,0.497,0.0846,5.077,7.592,7.0827,1.103,3.5383,1.8986,3.4636,3.6877,4.793,3.0878,2.6677,2.2432,1.366,2.7476,2.3799,1.0472,0.7899,5.0783,0.0645,5.1574,1.235,4.7778,0.336,2.2748,3.9045,1.7206,2.3113,1.0173,1.2112,0.2546,0.0594,6.4446,2.1541,0.5411,7.1163,0.5281,3.7405,5.4308,1.3777,1.2587,1.1072,0.0644,0.9799,2.231,0.2875,3.1583,3.5003,4.0564,4.8414,5.9908,4.2,0.5239,2.4781,2.217,1.7598,0.7309,0.5302,1.7995,5.2453,1.497,6.1916,1.8868,2.245,3.0469,3.7451,2.9144,6.141,0.9413,2.7274,1.812,5.3847,6.1605,2.2007,1.8885,0.7884,0.9395,3.7212,2.2372,2.2741,0.1501,0.6615,3.4261,1.7522,1.8245,2.4845,7.5514,6.9032,1.6853,2.6388,8.2409,2.034,1.1281,8.1588,3.4927,4.5442,0.0017,2.0605,0.0149,1.6211,0.6695,0.0019,1.0898,0.0031,0.0,0.0002,0.3094,1.6829,0.3068,1.9114,4.014,3.0798,2.1738,2.4067,2.2281,2.5911,0.7409,5.3942,1.269,3.241,0.3463,0.3153,1.5997,0.182,0.0933,0.1483,1.0629,0.9851,6.3891,1.5301,2.6654,4.8522,2.2146,1.3153,5.0724,3.3516,4.6872,2.0186,0.7433,0.0158,0.185,0.7428,1.3014,3.4914,0.6428,0.001,4.2094,1.4158,3.1941,0.0192,0.9179,2.3703,1.0821,2.4433,1.1157,1.1557,7.3775,2.64,1.1384,1.026,0.226,0.0675,0.2935,3.2747,5.7478,0.3985,4.5558,0.9777,5.2497,4.0557,0.853,1.8486,0.0407,3.6754,3.0477,1.0216,0.364,4.134,0.012,0.6383,0.4872,5.3294,0.6535,1.6028,4.2342,8.9168,6.0934,0.0362,0.8389,4.8018,3.6297,2.1075,2.2893,0.2124,4.3058,0.0001,3.7635,2.3669,6.7922,5.4521,0.6453,5.2234,5.1903,1.9473,0.705,1.6441,3.8799,3.9353,6.7745,2.3505,3.2825,0.1818,6.2073,4.7958,1.2624,0.7461,5.337,3.7006,0.0067,0.0001,0.0001,1.8806,5.0893,4.2595,3.3578,4.5859,3.1209,4.6663,6.796,0.012,3.4241,1.1981,2.3141,2.3718,16.3635,8.1902,1.0353,2.362,5.6111,10.2139,3.4196,1.4714,1.1629,0.033,0.8909,2.7378,2.3265,2.6373,3.4112,8.0522,0.1419,0.0529,3.9214,0.0268,1.0845,1.0365,0.1859,0.4441,4.3271,0.2243,4.1471,1.1539]}
{"prompt":"The European Union s chief Brexit negotiator told German industry on Wednesday that it was his responsibility to help European companies weather the exit of Britain from the EU , and he warned Britain that","text":"The European Union s chief Brexit negotiator told German industry on Wednesday that it was his responsibility to help European companies weather the exit of Britain from the EU, and he warned Britain that they must \u201cbe prepared for a Brexit without an end to the free movement of goods\u201d. \u201cIf we want to create good jobs, we need good trade and investment, we need to have some certainty over what the customs system of tomorrow will be,\u201d Commissioner Phil Hogan told the Industrie Forum in Munich. \u201cThere are risks, especially for British companies, as the British Government has indicated. What good is a free trade agreement when you can\u2019t guarantee the free flow of goods and the free movement of people? \u201d The EU s negotiating efforts have focused on ensuring that EU businesses can continue importing and selling products into Britain while the UK s remains a member of the bloc after Brexit, with the question of how to implement it still uncertain. In a recent speech, Mr. Hague told EU politicians: \u201cThe great dilemma in the United Kingdom is whether the United Kingdom will be a nation, a state or a member of the European Union. I am happy to point out that the current Prime Minister, the PM, believes that he will not be a member but a country. He believes he can create his own customs and immigration system \u2026. This is a very big concern, \u201d he said. The UK\u2019s exit has made it difficult for many British business leaders to come to terms with the sudden end of a lucrative trading arrangement with one of Europe\u2019s largest economies. The government of Prime Minister Theresa May says she will seek a divorce deal with the EU that allows it to remain in the world trade body but not to continue part of the single market, and she wants the agreement to be backed by EU leaders at a summit on Nov. 25. The issue is widely seen to be central to the negotiations, but Britain s departure has made it harder for trade negotiators around the world to understand exactly what is at stake. Mr. Hague said that, on the one hand, \u201cthe European Union has to deal with this negotiation from an extremely difficult position. \u201cBut, more than anything else,\u201d he said, \u201cwe must have the political will to succeed and to come to an agreement to save Europe\u2019s job market.\u201d He said the need to secure fair trade arrangements in Britain had led to an \u201cunprecedented\u201d level of co-operation with allies. But he also suggested that even Britain s strongest allies, including the US, were not as convinced as the EU that Britain wanted to negotiate a good deal. \u201cWhen it comes to creating clarity and a long-term relationship between the UK and the EU, they are less convinced than we are,\u201d he said.","token_len":577,"entropy":[8.1703,1.422,11.7625,9.7438,2.9414,0.0161,8.8403,4.8652,8.6581,3.3233,1.8565,0.4333,2.7646,1.0979,5.0381,4.3506,0.095,4.3857,4.9834,1.6171,8.4151,0.6909,6.0184,3.0363,2.6436,0.8966,0.0022,1.1782,2.4845,2.5828,2.6077,4.5364,3.8823,4.6286,6.2255,4.303,19.1361,10.403,8.2747,0.3131,1.5742,1.6216,3.9481,4.1488,7.1929,3.703,0.1777,0.867,4.3265,0.0234,0.1109,7.6774,9.9342,8.8094,2.0211,6.4741,0.222,5.5059,1.9224,3.1411,0.4568,4.9486,5.2518,0.9244,1.3438,0.6572,1.7481,5.2881,1.6868,2.3425,2.0075,1.5945,4.19,0.1472,2.2603,2.3207,4.8257,4.4678,3.6376,2.3686,2.6661,3.7073,3.135,4.5417,8.624,1.1674,1.4305,2.0459,6.2882,2.1268,7.8681,9.395,0.0176,1.4455,1.7366,8.2806,1.0239,7.3355,0.8197,3.4168,0.2389,1.9414,0.0783,3.7039,1.6458,4.9582,2.3714,4.9375,2.3569,3.5679,1.3804,0.7967,4.2142,2.4273,4.3477,4.3852,1.6265,3.5081,2.6005,5.6214,6.9848,1.4347,2.0309,3.4047,1.8697,0.8104,3.2584,1.4043,2.1031,14.3688,7.6513,2.9506,3.0785,2.2764,4.3848,4.7558,0.0468,0.6382,1.4668,4.8318,1.9732,0.1852,0.0214,1.5504,1.4165,2.4522,4.0113,3.171,2.497,7.739,4.8648,8.8246,1.6626,4.3667,0.2999,3.7168,0.4232,3.8292,3.3675,1.8599,3.573,8.1829,1.8403,2.5284,2.391,4.6069,2.6623,4.9526,3.5099,0.9194,7.5568,5.9585,1.4552,0.6503,0.7946,0.0226,3.5714,7.5544,0.8652,2.4359,4.1508,1.3524,7.5789,0.3162,1.9685,1.6697,4.77,3.2021,3.1576,4.8171,0.2444,3.7118,2.8051,3.1323,2.7611,1.1523,1.814,1.2891,6.0417,3.5116,3.3091,5.7344,3.5787,0.9414,1.8779,2.5305,6.9434,7.6428,3.0782,0.9475,3.9046,0.1851,0.915,1.6968,2.6208,1.9522,0.1728,1.5911,1.9663,2.3413,6.1186,3.1176,1.3489,2.7716,0.6999,0.3829,3.6407,0.0738,0.2309,0.476,0.1217,1.3665,3.2276,2.1151,5.2858,0.3717,4.9982,0.1365,0.2233,1.3179,5.7026,5.6483,0.0101,1.0741,3.412,5.4709,1.2026,5.5057,0.4626,4.7026,2.9326,2.21,0.5385,1.7141,0.7193,6.0645,1.6209,4.7122,0.8921,2.0237,2.0966,2.79,1.6556,4.5013,3.9812,0.1767,3.9979,3.5335,2.1252,0.5548,7.9979,3.9303,3.8797,0.8262,1.6438,2.0195,4.1196,5.1727,2.3851,4.3729,2.5244,4.3395,1.1476,0.7056,2.7962,2.9868,7.1346,1.4953,0.07,5.9388,3.3829,3.6345,0.9586,2.1554,0.3528,2.8549,2.9786,4.1678,2.6235,0.5172,4.3842,0.5489,1.0523,0.0768,0.5886,9.5111,5.3737,0.6283,4.6391,6.4265,2.8969,4.5374,0.9027,5.8351,0.0691,1.6775,1.3274,2.089,0.1493,2.0952,1.2961,0.3355,2.1618,4.0724,3.6556,1.5618,0.0038,1.1531,0.0058,4.7757,1.6689,1.4357,3.8888,2.1986,5.7589,1.8059,0.715,0.3766,0.7215,3.4969,3.9819,3.5992,0.0571,2.5567,1.0196,0.217,6.7858,4.4418,4.1974,3.351,3.5551,2.1181,5.1101,6.929,0.4785,0.3851,2.633,0.0358,2.2936,2.0429,2.3275,2.6405,2.18,5.9814,0.6119,0.7898,6.5465,0.2622,4.2361,3.0284,4.7164,1.0711,1.0347,2.8018,4.6956,0.0193,3.5192,0.7098,2.0856,4.9068,1.9113,5.7795,1.9471,2.5375,0.3824,6.1296,0.0942,1.0063,2.8097,1.3795,2.7003,5.2838,6.9642,3.6869,1.4255,3.1439,0.2122,1.9578,0.3489,5.4778,1.8102,7.0492,0.0169,0.2086,0.118,4.2989,4.3532,0.6451,1.8761,1.6677,0.041,0.457,3.1721,0.0005,1.0793,1.0336,1.7422,3.6502,4.2662,0.892,1.1502,0.0229,0.01,8.9192,1.0166,1.3607,3.5338,0.4603,1.9519,3.328,3.8392,0.1124,3.651,5.9867,4.1635,3.1759,5.5044,2.9298,1.4579,1.3521,1.7988,0.0603,1.7093,1.3682,6.3488,3.607,1.1365,0.4588,0.0429,4.4275,1.659,3.3163,0.4082,0.3146,1.1633,0.1287,2.7461,2.2605,3.0978,2.5737,4.575,0.4807,0.783,4.9208,3.4731,2.2211,4.4727,0.5733,0.9779,0.1959,4.4235,5.6091,4.7024,1.5743,0.4656,0.4248,4.6209,4.6408,1.1734,2.6324,1.3587,2.4985,0.9613,2.1323,5.7816,1.1394,4.6058,6.9943,1.17,4.1667,3.0699,4.4246,3.6086,3.3913,0.612,3.1156,13.3334,1.6036,2.9723,1.829,0.0006,3.5346,0.9466,2.9039,0.0025,7.1012,0.2474,0.0085,2.9147,6.6179,2.2789,4.0386,1.2389,2.4906,4.2193,0.1939,4.9161,5.5877,2.8699,8.2337,2.2158,2.0192,1.5909,0.8853,2.3146,0.4657,1.7977,1.8864,3.2784,4.0222,1.966,2.061,1.3004,3.3573,2.2897,5.6392,0.4686,6.5257,1.263,4.983,0.4238,1.0551,2.4933,0.4691,4.9019,2.577,0.1299,0.0312,5.7143,7.598,1.7493,3.1712,5.0115,0.0803,0.0666,2.7398,2.0137,0.7594,1.4622,0.0888,0.3636,0.2918,0.2171,4.7025,1.2262,5.5432,2.2897,1.0077,2.058,0.6681,1.8123,1.1254,0.8147,0.3692,0.161,0.0638]}

{"prompt":"Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said on Tuesday he will tell his U.S. counterpart that the New York trial of a Turkish banker , charged with helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions , is not legal","text":"Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said on Tuesday he will tell his U.S. counterpart that the New York trial of a Turkish banker, charged with helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions, is not legal. Gul added that he will convey to his U.S. counterpart the decision of an arbitration tribunal in the Hague. Gul said that this could change the proceedings.\nFormer New York Giants star Andre Johnson is on trial in his hometown and in New York. Johnson claims he has been wrongfully accused of sexual assault. Johnson is accused of having sex with a woman, which he claims he did.\nThe prosecutor's request not to charge him with a felony stemming from Johnson's use of a computer at an FBI office to access official government documents has been approved by the district attorney's office. The official complaint filed with state Supreme Court records also calls the computer he used in 2007 to access the government documents \"pirated.\"\nThe alleged victim, a student, alleged that on Oct. 16, 2007, Mr. Johnson and a man named Tony Zavala met at the University of Oklahoma's campus library. Police say Mr. Johnson and Tony Zavala then made their way to a hallway and Mr. Johnson told the alleged victim that he was going to his room but he wanted to go back to his car, which is in the same building. The victim says Mr. Johnson offered her money if she would leave with him to his bedroom in a room off the hallway. The victim says he refused. The victim was on the other side of the building and had locked the door before leaving. The alleged victim claims Mr. Johnson followed her into the same hallway and walked to one of the hotel rooms the victim stated was used by Mr. Johnson when he hosted the victims, a woman, in a room. Mr. Johnson, the alleged victim says, held her while Mr. Zavala put his hand over it. The victim claims Mr. Johnson asked her what she was wearing so that he would not get the wrong idea. She believes Mr. Johnson told her he would take off her clothes if she would not leave with him. The victim alleges Mr. Johnson then tried to pull her into his room, which she also believes she did not consent to. The alleged victim then left the hotel, but Mr. Johnson followed her and called for her phone and then Mr. Johnson told her to meet him in the hallway of the hotel at noon at a certain time, at which point the alleged victim left the hotel without calling the police, according to the official complaint.\nOn Tuesday, the district attorney's office said the criminal charges from the official complaint were dismissed at the request of the prosecutor. The woman, the alleged victim, says she did not file charges with the police because she did not want her past relationship with Mr. Johnson made public.","token_len":577,"entropy":[9.5097,1.2276,7.5288,5.2287,5.9873,5.5941,1.98,1.6853,2.0561,3.3227,3.5801,7.4333,2.8896,6.7828,0.1008,0.6022,0.1222,0.5668,1.033,1.7143,7.8508,0.1364,7.7038,1.9285,3.1277,3.4532,5.1496,3.7402,5.5653,0.1456,3.6293,4.59,2.0275,2.4737,0.0002,0.0419,0.0109,0.0393,0.27,1.6227,2.2907,4.8226,0.4014,3.7477,3.5353,0.2886,1.671,1.7724,7.2251,1.362,2.167,1.9135,0.0005,0.011,0.0212,0.0825,1.6482,3.2723,2.0011,4.5839,4.7996,2.4521,1.9592,2.5602,0.635,1.4188,3.6398,0.9916,1.7756,5.1148,3.3134,4.3043,1.7522,6.2247,1.7851,0.95,20.3035,4.61,0.0601,7.9653,3.8705,7.902,3.4227,2.9389,4.0669,0.2262,1.1475,5.3001,4.6555,5.6107,3.9521,2.6559,0.2993,2.4398,2.6269,5.7418,1.2049,5.1772,1.0398,5.4849,0.0135,2.1702,0.2947,7.2282,1.3365,1.8997,2.5834,2.2056,1.547,0.0439,2.7091,1.0714,0.0297,1.0812,2.0472,3.6101,3.8829,1.1109,3.1323,1.8263,1.9761,3.6013,1.4945,2.5035,4.9184,1.7338,7.7021,5.8274,0.1518,4.2296,3.1274,0.8256,1.7834,4.2511,6.9477,0.0026,3.8337,0.0484,6.8887,0.0096,1.0592,3.9356,4.3711,3.6468,3.9757,1.6827,4.137,3.3752,6.5894,1.819,1.0334,2.561,1.3537,4.6288,0.1342,0.6991,4.5441,0.3049,0.2159,0.0187,0.6138,1.9211,6.9053,3.8666,3.763,1.6301,6.2407,4.8993,0.0177,4.6568,3.8529,4.3375,2.6476,6.8198,4.445,0.6023,3.2363,6.4241,0.9177,0.731,2.023,2.1457,1.895,0.9926,9.1561,0.8601,0.9896,0.7408,1.7449,4.5805,1.484,1.553,2.4629,4.164,2.8671,4.2645,0.8421,5.2431,3.7644,0.0068,3.5168,0.1382,1.2092,0.1116,6.4167,0.0001,0.0835,3.3615,1.9172,3.9449,2.2146,6.2307,5.1873,3.7368,1.3667,4.8844,1.349,1.6792,3.8046,0.0549,4.4367,2.5625,3.019,7.4468,1.6386,5.1921,1.8678,1.7939,0.0002,0.4681,2.5296,4.4441,0.1582,0.0011,0.0005,1.9235,3.8512,3.9214,0.1156,0.2968,1.3108,6.4319,2.0724,5.2276,0.0002,0.6519,3.703,1.5259,4.1204,0.0568,0.979,0.5869,1.3289,1.3772,0.0278,4.4297,2.1951,5.5569,1.7994,3.1175,0.3009,2.137,2.618,0.7593,0.852,4.5293,2.6837,2.0179,3.4212,2.778,0.9002,2.4466,2.1833,1.3365,1.627,2.7306,2.5661,1.2232,0.0004,0.1316,5.491,2.6231,2.0389,4.6143,0.065,1.3813,3.04,4.3087,0.3035,3.4129,5.3241,3.6505,3.7325,2.2835,2.6977,5.491,1.1183,5.3394,0.5556,1.3899,1.434,1.1607,1.8816,3.7671,1.4577,1.7713,1.7127,3.7635,5.6227,1.4805,4.6391,0.1958,0.0629,0.1248,4.2805,2.3941,5.2915,5.5164,1.0713,0.1568,3.8951,4.5602,0.5496,1.737,1.3587,0.0624,2.8372,1.1264,0.0004,0.1169,4.2748,0.0841,2.0361,0.9577,6.9837,2.1357,0.995,6.2818,3.0138,6.1227,0.2026,0.445,6.6615,0.3952,5.7593,1.451,7.9005,2.034,3.535,1.4751,1.5124,0.0003,1.0362,4.5484,0.9968,8.2355,2.2731,4.4868,3.7359,3.9595,2.375,2.6098,2.0032,2.511,1.8204,2.088,2.206,0.0005,0.0662,3.8023,2.154,1.165,0.0107,1.5409,0.0715,5.659,0.8579,4.6221,3.4499,0.0005,0.4731,0.001,0.0008,5.8219,0.8755,1.1208,2.0229,8.0581,0.9112,1.2414,1.2164,1.9573,0.8973,0.0006,0.0995,4.0894,0.5379,3.0312,0.6513,1.2779,1.1916,4.7946,2.1868,0.8221,2.7375,1.5373,2.957,3.9595,2.9715,2.6381,0.8068,3.1786,7.0394,1.1853,0.0008,0.0045,3.4361,0.1453,1.331,2.1248,3.3158,2.9534,0.284,1.668,1.8286,0.1517,4.1693,2.41,0.7719,2.3479,0.0521,0.3122,1.1794,1.0316,2.0698,0.886,0.0006,0.0097,1.5429,4.4473,0.0256,4.1263,0.475,1.8857,1.506,0.638,1.8367,2.5922,1.1018,7.2691,2.5843,5.8283,1.7297,1.7098,2.3979,0.0058,0.5353,1.0655,1.1114,0.0376,4.4983,3.1122,1.1723,1.9469,3.4617,2.3959,1.2571,0.0006,0.0947,3.106,0.0841,2.6676,4.6019,4.4681,1.4086,2.5688,3.0703,3.5997,5.5996,0.0005,1.9576,2.8532,0.1985,1.0797,5.5002,0.385,1.887,0.8585,1.4991,4.164,0.5755,0.9145,4.9723,6.0596,4.5542,1.8809,5.9261,0.9788,2.3973,4.7081,0.4388,1.2623,2.1566,0.3268,0.0211,2.4728,0.9391,0.7948,4.7966,5.7112,2.2569,0.279,2.5487,1.434,0.001,0.5898,5.5789,0.0343,0.2193,0.9409,3.9782,1.9172,0.2566,1.3711,1.9524,0.0309,0.0972,0.0185,2.2671,2.0665,5.1917,1.9336,7.1272,0.6489,8.2669,0.1086,2.1749,1.2117,5.2291,0.5575,0.5494,0.0018,0.7092,3.1478,1.6093,1.715,5.1415,2.8887,4.1485,3.2955,0.0211,1.6527,3.7763,0.7102,3.0294,0.0579,3.5071,2.2131,3.6107,0.2209,3.7726,1.5854,0.867,2.0723,0.0093,0.6202,2.6409,7.3651,3.8769,0.2701,0.2873,0.0003,0.0655,5.6526,0.0546,0.3881]}

Senators Ron","text":"A U.S. Senate Republican tax bill strongly backed by President Donald Trump faced potential opposition on Monday from two Republican lawmakers who could prevent the sweeping legislation from reaching the Senate floor. Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Todd Young of Indiana argued that Senate Democrats should have the power to veto the tax hike bill. The Senate Budget committee made a final decision on the tax legislation for Friday but did so without taking up a Senate floor vote. Sen. Jon Tester, Republican of Montana, said he had not met with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, about the tax legislation. Collins voted for the bill with the other four Senate Republicans who opposed the bill in the panel vote on Thursday morning.\nA U.S. Senate minority leader said Democrats in the chamber were not opposed to a sweeping tax overhaul. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York announced after a meeting with Democratic leaders on Monday that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would meet with the Senate\u2019s tax reform committee to discuss a proposal that would lower taxes on the wealthy while making tax cuts permanent. The meeting was initially scheduled for Friday but was delayed by hours later when McConnell said he would hold it. Schumer said that Democrats in the Senate had made their positions on the tax bill known prior to its announcement on Friday but he added that Democrats would be willing to continue discussions about tax reform in the coming days. According to Schumer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she was open to revisiting the tax issue. \u201cAny resolution that will make our tax system more equitable is a step in the right direction,\u201d she said.\nSome Republicans worry that the tax overhaul bill would put pressure on President Donald Trump to allow the U.S. to be more open to China. The tax plan would increase the nation\u2019s deficit by $2 trillion for the next decade, raising concerns that President Trump may balk at the bill if he wants allies to approve it. A group of eight Republican governors urged their own federal leaders to find a compromise instead. The group said it would work together to come up with a way to move forward with Congress and ensure lawmakers support a tax compromise that is less onerous on business and the middle class. Republican governors said the tax bill may jeopardize U.S. competitiveness and threaten U.S. jobs, but they pointed out that other countries were following a similar course. The group said that there could be no true compromise if the tax plan puts the U.S. off-course to fulfill President Trump\u2019s campaign promises of tax cuts for the middle class. \u201cOur competitiveness is at stake,\u201d Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said in a statement. \u201cAs president and his administration continue to prioritize unilateral over global policy, Washington is not making the U.S. more competitive.

{"prompt":"Britain s intention to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit is inconsistent with its plan to withdraw from the European Union s single market and customs union , a committee","text":"Britain s intention to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit is inconsistent with its plan to withdraw from the European Union s single market and customs union, a committee of Irish House of Commons MPs told the BBC.\nA two-day public inquiry into Brexit began Thursday, with a focus on how to avoid a hard border on Ireland s southern border with Northern Ireland after Britain left the European Union (EU) following a trade deal.\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has long insisted that he intends to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after leaving the EU. But during a question in Parliament on Wednesday, two committee members warned against such an expectation, and suggested the government could instead be faced with a no-deal Brexit.\nOn May 29 it becomes binding to follow the UK\u2019s divorce treaty if it has not entered negotiations yet. There\u2019s a chance of doing it anyway\nDuring a question in Parliament on Wednesday, two committee members warned against such an expectation, and suggested the government could instead Be faced with a no-deal Brexit. In an earlier question on Ireland, another committee member pointed out that the government could be facing \u201ca no-deal Brexit. The former British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, who is a member of the inquiry set up by the government to ensure that the country remains part of the single market after Brexit, said the government was \u201cambivalent\u201d about how to deal with an Irish border \u201cwhen it comes time to exit the EU\u201d. He also warned of a \u201ctissue of contradictions\u201d that Johnson is likely to employ \u2013 particularly in relation to Northern Ireland \u2013 to try to win support for a hard border.\nJohnson had been promising a hard border, rather than keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union. This was at great risk of triggering the so-called Hard Brexit of Irish veto of any deal to keep in the customs union:\nThere is no way we can be sure what we are getting when we leave the EU. That is why it\u2019s absolutely vital that we get a robust deal that can be backed up by the Irish. If we have one of the weakest deals there is then they will go and say how do we sort this out?\nWith such a weak deal, there is also the risk of being excluded from the common economic space of the European Union. This would effectively make any border between Ireland and Northern Ireland an international border, rather than a frontier between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland as they are now.\nThis is a problem that the UK Government has avoided. The UK government has not agreed a deal with the EU to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union if it leaves the EU on a hard Brexit. Nor has Britain agreed if and how it would treat Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland under any potential future trade agreements with the EU.","token_len":578,"entropy":[8.1133,11.0894,0.6,6.2256,2.2081,6.1926,2.4474,3.2159,4.8012,0.0371,2.0328,0.001,4.6208,1.7913,3.1466,9.136,0.0535,2.8861,5.7824,0.3629,5.3918,0.485,0.0278,1.6052,0.3843,8.8921,5.8961,0.0418,1.2313,0.9151,0.0024,2.1576,2.3226,5.648,0.8315,4.0597,7.424,0.1049,0.6876,2.8667,4.3597,0.8452,3.6856,0.8633,0.3423,14.7717,6.9489,0.0541,2.4983,4.3577,1.4502,0.4828,3.6631,6.0546,5.1242,2.1087,1.1453,2.0142,4.0287,0.0179,2.6987,1.838,3.2522,1.3517,0.2981,0.1166,4.3948,4.6198,3.188,5.0148,0.1065,0.9537,1.1885,0.002,2.9996,3.0752,4.9423,0.0203,1.2027,0.0148,5.7343,0.7899,0.893,4.3046,2.5725,6.2746,0.3127,1.9932,0.1175,13.5219,0.8624,0.0018,10.4672,0.0006,2.2963,5.716,3.3316,0.6301,2.1736,3.9112,0.0589,3.2533,0.4846,0.1073,0.058,1.349,1.247,0.0181,0.184,0.0015,0.4275,2.8173,0.0362,0.3488,1.1555,2.6138,6.3897,1.1564,3.7413,5.3659,2.4068,0.9031,1.7741,0.4387,7.6701,6.0897,0.135,4.3158,3.7292,3.857,1.9012,6.8382,1.6966,2.7925,2.4802,2.0771,1.5134,2.0449,6.0537,4.0545,5.883,0.0218,0.7364,8.4917,0.0694,0.7076,1.6136,1.223,0.1063,4.3108,6.5993,3.3324,5.7969,7.3871,9.2123,3.7366,5.7088,1.2782,2.7226,12.4729,7.4041,1.5621,5.6929,4.2134,3.7141,1.143,3.7325,2.3483,4.6691,5.4093,6.8058,1.1255,5.5639,10.2444,0.1501,0.0488,1.332,4.0901,1.6038,5.6863,4.6434,5.9188,6.0946,5.5986,2.0927,1.8046,1.6283,0.6468,0.3665,0.2196,0.1851,0.8332,0.1274,0.0009,0.1193,0.0735,0.025,0.0087,0.0232,0.0947,0.008,0.0019,0.0188,0.0027,0.0199,0.0115,12.9242,10.571,0.0048,0.0273,0.1167,0.0152,0.0002,0.0145,1.1082,5.2724,2.6317,4.6955,2.4832,1.8438,7.4955,1.258,5.951,0.8411,0.0507,3.8386,0.5294,0.2378,1.4098,1.96,1.473,2.7201,2.1692,13.5916,4.4692,1.6732,2.3374,0.0628,0.016,0.1909,3.9779,3.0666,5.2318,5.0396,2.6482,0.2091,2.6979,0.7312,2.506,0.83,1.819,2.7838,1.0074,0.0094,0.1712,5.8443,8.7949,0.0228,0.4743,0.8405,3.0258,3.0565,4.5558,1.1977,1.3405,2.4317,2.9851,1.7194,0.0011,0.059,1.2968,0.0051,3.6468,0.5071,0.1263,0.9482,1.9466,1.0696,2.0003,11.5259,0.5104,8.043,1.0874,0.5552,6.2226,1.084,4.0052,1.0219,1.6165,0.0206,3.1257,2.3353,1.4397,6.5275,0.6114,5.2333,0.9452,1.9979,6.7102,0.3856,3.6948,0.4179,0.611,4.0657,7.517,1.2313,3.5287,2.6182,2.8808,2.8798,1.3259,7.4061,0.9403,5.2529,7.7406,2.3825,7.9138,0.2187,1.4408,2.7413,8.5423,3.5464,1.7856,0.0137,6.8222,7.2357,4.1472,1.4274,1.9827,0.0022,3.5713,0.0234,2.24,1.7988,3.0796,0.2669,5.1545,1.6045,0.5779,1.1973,1.2529,0.2614,0.9006,0.1897,4.8316,4.4028,2.7364,6.2466,2.5825,1.0047,0.137,3.0067,7.2682,0.01,7.3449,4.8322,0.0301,1.4783,0.4391,2.237,0.0088,1.2347,4.5598,2.2303,4.8232,9.1939,0.4483,1.1469,3.4226,2.9682,3.9989,0.0365,0.0012,7.5059,0.5597,6.1196,6.8672,9.4784,4.0235,1.9115,1.7264,3.5007,4.0131,5.4331,2.7204,1.5983,0.0097,6.5013,3.5374,4.2889,1.193,1.5807,2.8956,3.2167,0.8653,3.4424,2.787,3.4559,3.0514,2.2089,3.0141,4.4259,0.4393,1.0399,0.2618,0.9,1.0921,3.4299,0.5885,1.9399,2.7125,5.6236,2.6049,0.1077,3.6578,3.1559,0.454,0.3806,3.0055,1.8433,8.2918,3.0358,2.3682,3.746,1.5583,5.7956,1.128,0.4857,1.6053,1.928,2.7288,3.2054,0.7966,3.4463,5.5382,2.8805,1.0081,5.3901,2.7813,5.3969,0.6969,7.2077,5.6428,1.4919,4.1746,2.9701,3.1737,6.1864,2.8348,0.2613,6.8859,1.8087,0.1078,1.5496,1.8096,5.6827,4.7653,0.7426,3.9989,0.2498,0.6587,2.5828,0.7196,3.8713,0.5355,0.865,0.6857,3.3615,6.2003,0.1232,0.6531,5.0155,5.9918,4.3109,2.0854,0.5554,2.2061,0.2231,1.3022,2.4265,2.1039,5.1937,3.2487,4.0923,5.2777,2.3334,1.0753,0.0341,0.3378,0.0016,3.3121,4.2999,3.1309,1.7144,3.9204,0.004,0.7206,6.5959,1.654,1.0688,5.2199,2.8716,0.1474,1.8312,0.002,4.7976,4.5979,1.5576,1.4285,0.4219,0.6059,3.4953,1.1816,1.7788,3.6704,1.0967,2.1717,3.0493,2.3053,1.082,6.9605,2.6665,1.9515,3.1013,2.3946,1.0258,3.2265,4.2192,2.7562,1.4165,1.2082,1.0992,1.5463,2.0619,1.5592,2.4357,0.013,0.3564,0.0986,0.19,0.0046,5.7628,0.8011,2.6957,0.2816,0.7055,4.8421,2.8117,1.0547,0.4894,0.6235,5.8974,0.469,6.1151,0.794,7.218,5.5754,3.8367,1.4363,1.924,4.7056,6.7598,1.8271,2.0169,0.6773,0.2842,0.0019,4.3673,2.5009,7.2162,2.7771,1.7775,3.2606,1.7449,0.3998,0.5895,0.294]}
{"prompt":"Several countries , the United Nations and journalist groups are demanding the release of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo from detention in Myanmar . The reporters were arrested on Dec. 12 after","text":"Several countries, the United Nations and journalist groups are demanding the release of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo from detention in Myanmar. The reporters were arrested on Dec. 12 after a report on the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, whose war against the police and military is currently grinding death and destruction. Reuters reports that Myanmar\u2019s military has denied the report\u2019s accuracy and is now considering the release of the reporters.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross has said that it has been unable to visit all of the Rohingya camps in which the Rakhine Muslims had fled to with the help of the Iranians.\nThe Iranians have already deported 300 Muslim Rohingya and have told the remaining thousands that they will be forcibly returned to their homes in an area that has largely been destroyed and inhabited by Buddhists.\nA small number of refugees escaped on boats. But there are reports of Rohingya being prevented by Buddhist militia from escaping the region and of those attempting to flee being beaten and killed.\nThe Myanmar Army has detained and interrogated several Myanmar journalists in connection with a report on the violence in the disputed area, the BBC\u2019s report said.\nHowever, media groups have condemned the release of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were arrested and charged with illegally crossing national borders of Myanmar. They released a written statement on Monday demanding the journalists\u2019 immediate release.\nPress freedom activist and blogger Kyaw Zeya Aung has said that the journalists\u2019 arrest is a violation of a fundamental human right and that it is an act to silence media freedom and push the public to believe that the Rohingya are criminals.\nThe police have also detained about a dozen local journalists, many of whom have already been convicted or charged about their coverage of the ethnic violence since September.\nThe Reuters report alleges that the authorities created a conflict between the Rohingya and Buddhists to weaken the military, and that the Rohingya armed themselves with weapons and other supplies obtained from the border region.\nThe Associated Press reported on December 14th that the Iranians assisted the Rohingya militants by allowing hundreds of them to stay in Jashore on Iran\u2019s northwestern coast.\nIranian president and Foreign Minister Ahmadinejad have said several times that Iran is providing shelter to the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.

{"prompt":"Relatives of former national security adviser Michael Flynn have set up a fund to help pay for his legal defense against federal and congressional investigations into potential collusion between Donald Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign","text":"Relatives of former national security adviser Michael Flynn have set up a fund to help pay for his legal defense against federal and congressional investigations into potential collusion between Donald Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign and Russia. The Flynn fund will receive donations from individuals, corporations, faith, sports, community, and other groups. \u201d\nTrump: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to try to impeach me\u2026 I\u2019m not going to run for election, and if I were, that\u2019s where I\u2019d be!\u201d\nDonald Trump has threatened to impeach President Barack Obama and \u201cimpeach me\u201d if he isn\u2019t asked to do so because he considers Obama \u201cto be not just an enemy of the country but the world.\u201d That\u2019s according to CNN, citing a speech in New Hampshire.\nThe president is being asked to remove Obama from office by a Republican and Democratic Senate committee in an impeachment trial that doesn\u2019t have an end date to date. His critics consider Trump to be making a political campaign out of the entire ordeal \u2014 much to the chagrin of the current Democratic President in Office, Joe Biden.\nIn the past, some of Trump\u2019s most vocal and vocal supporters, including most Republican Senators, have argued against impeachment. Now, they\u2019re in a tizzy over the president \u201cbreaking his agreement to resign\u201d and are calling for impeachment proceedings to begin \u2014 all on account of Trump \u201cbreaking his promise\u201d to President Obama.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Trump \u2013 and some of his most vocal supporters, have talked about either impeaching or displacing Barack Obama.\nFormer President Obama \u2013 who has spent far and away the most time in the Democratic presidential primary race \u2013 has argued on numerous occasions that the president is making up stories about Russia colluding with his campaign and that he was fired because of this.\nBarack Obama went so far as to tweet in 2018 that he wants to impeach Trump for \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201ccoup.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the only time he\u2019d say those things, though\u2026\nLast October, he told an interviewer that Donald Trump wanted to impeach him, adding \u201cBecause he\u2019s a traitor, really.\u201d\nFormer Republican Senator and former candidate, John McCain, made the similar comment in a television interview\u2026 again last October.\nHe said, \u201cI think if we impeach him, it\u2019s a matter of how he stands up to the impeachment. I think he\u2019d take it in stride, I think he\u2019d come up with something good. I think that if he\u2019s on the hook, it\u2019s a pretty good deal.\u201d","token_len":580,"entropy":[8.5063,0.571,4.7192,6.9477,0.2866,0.482,0.3705,0.0026,2.503,7.2365,0.2179,0.4007,3.4658,0.8208,0.5893,2.2207,0.2011,2.373,0.8821,1.3135,5.3473,4.0632,4.9107,1.9248,1.9481,0.7549,4.5402,0.9915,0.2028,5.4652,0.0038,16.8292,7.6442,9.1015,4.4069,0.0371,0.1004,0.1898,0.7211,1.6795,6.4393,1.3789,2.6227,5.6206,4.6149,0.7264,3.1514,2.419,2.7289,0.8443,8.7574,5.4867,5.6822,3.2883,6.7392,3.7322,0.8816,1.4192,1.1769,1.8735,5.1707,7.8294,2.0194,14.4457,5.5938,8.9718,5.5651,7.3572,9.4774,10.3076,4.2311,2.6894,2.2001,0.0858,6.6783,0.388,4.6794,0.0004,0.847,4.8966,2.6525,3.1455,2.2066,1.3457,1.4899,0.3034,0.0083,4.0547,0.8503,5.6972,2.5322,2.3031,3.5938,1.0777,2.8974,1.7261,3.9965,3.5566,0.5738,0.7251,3.9434,0.6692,3.1158,0.116,3.3878,1.573,5.795,2.9857,4.104,2.2108,6.0326,0.2399,3.1005,5.0392,0.3105,2.0802,0.0017,2.8568,0.9176,0.0061,2.855,13.8921,1.6118,6.3114,0.5034,0.115,3.1203,3.6504,5.2806,3.3774,0.5972,4.3057,1.5923,0.6616,0.093,6.1269,0.8127,0.6667,0.0613,6.9649,1.2025,6.4747,2.9871,5.2766,1.8682,2.8033,0.0467,6.47,4.7181,2.3523,3.8525,1.2728,0.3755,3.4875,1.3258,3.0916,5.1619,1.9719,3.5457,1.4649,4.8729,2.5471,0.401,0.6099,8.3158,0.0158,4.965,2.5246,5.4007,1.8403,5.5392,4.1737,3.51,0.8278,1.7089,1.1927,2.438,4.0165,2.8052,4.7965,1.4068,0.5479,4.1892,1.2929,0.5742,0.0981,2.3304,1.9566,1.9942,4.2905,4.735,4.6335,3.4062,3.251,2.4954,6.9936,3.7874,1.4933,7.2818,0.9649,0.7166,0.0123,2.8658,3.6561,4.1944,0.4783,5.8757,3.2859,0.3471,5.7252,4.6214,6.9105,4.8442,1.004,0.0238,5.9548,1.0975,2.6204,5.577,3.7636,0.0091,2.3073,6.9581,5.6696,5.0939,6.2938,1.404,0.3133,1.3242,0.0001,0.0003,0.0286,2.2846,5.2667,2.7728,5.5696,3.8655,8.9538,2.3505,5.5657,0.0544,0.5975,0.5539,3.2852,2.1962,2.8232,0.7365,4.6623,2.4678,1.7179,2.632,0.1832,0.0505,3.4073,2.7749,5.3585,2.5847,0.6571,3.9789,0.7674,5.7703,4.169,2.1987,0.6006,0.3836,4.2503,3.7414,0.9999,1.2785,5.0988,0.6746,2.4007,3.527,0.1985,1.1612,4.1212,1.4707,6.5517,0.0982,2.1221,1.6584,2.2557,3.651,0.8215,7.6679,2.1302,7.1661,1.0757,3.5752,3.5603,1.3177,1.466,6.1188,2.8018,0.3472,2.0709,3.1416,1.6288,1.7413,5.9485,3.8064,3.6028,6.8949,0.0448,2.3589,2.5095,0.1945,3.0185,1.184,1.4142,5.1066,1.1221,1.2236,7.6013,0.6112,0.9156,0.4826,3.7611,3.3401,0.3525,0.292,0.1853,1.795,0.1533,0.0736,2.2227,9.2192,2.2921,3.5501,0.8347,0.135,2.0372,0.82,0.341,2.4177,7.6358,5.8168,0.4094,7.5722,2.3233,0.031,0.8486,9.7322,0.0003,3.5209,0.0281,0.8605,1.9303,4.6462,2.5595,2.67,4.9238,1.9661,2.4502,4.7144,6.5311,6.7537,3.0172,0.0956,1.285,0.184,1.9648,1.0261,6.9192,3.2129,1.0289,3.8023,1.3613,1.9725,5.2544,4.2867,2.2888,0.0619,0.3116,2.2337,2.0817,1.6715,4.8445,4.7983,2.6071,0.8381,3.9043,6.9026,0.0272,0.1713,2.4615,0.5588,1.5316,2.3694,1.6394,3.1712,4.9148,1.578,0.3574,2.9462,0.4556,0.8352,7.2188,0.0015,0.0446,5.9605,2.2158,0.0173,0.0218,0.029,5.5575,3.2624,9.6507,0.5072,1.1259,4.7813,0.6981,0.5503,0.0081,1.7286,1.8374,7.3925,0.3005,5.6881,0.0169,0.7473,0.5595,1.7842,5.9438,0.1333,4.9381,0.8642,4.0944,2.389,0.8179,3.1222,5.1542,0.2905,0.1322,0.0278,2.287,2.2937,1.6306,1.952,0.9095,0.076,0.5881,5.2668,5.655,0.4669,2.3093,2.8968,5.5872,0.8401,5.9236,4.1913,0.1366,3.2735,3.3189,3.6887,2.1818,0.5957,5.1599,0.0291,5.2318,0.3676,0.6145,0.0052,0.8025,3.3032,4.6449,2.9396,0.9522,7.1822,1.7415,2.9695,0.0668,1.3154,1.4614,3.3602,1.9382,8.0094,1.2393,0.9244,1.0251,1.2316,5.0946,3.4145,1.559,3.1321,2.5874,5.7598,2.9557,1.8844,0.0712,0.8468,4.2296,1.76,4.638,2.7563,1.1286,2.2818,5.0747,0.0857,6.1584,8.454,5.5371,1.8274,0.6607,0.6358,3.7894,2.0499,2.067,1.6952,0.7862,1.3693,1.9235,3.2326,2.1369,3.039,0.012,1.3529,0.6717,2.8186,2.6901,0.1623,0.1292,2.6139,4.9852,0.2196,3.9016,2.1634,6.5554,1.3164,1.3855,1.1476,9.2268,2.5132,2.3522,0.9107,1.8787,0.9014,0.0361,0.9716,5.2318,2.2645,3.9138,2.25,1.9025,3.2849,0.3198,0.5888,0.4731,0.0125,0.1084,5.0232,1.75,0.1755,2.5972,4.3488,1.3528,1.7557,0.4222,2.2608,3.155,1.2394,0.185,0.0237,0.7476,5.361,0.6359,5.4831,1.9104,2.7498,0.7466,0.0125,0.0633,1.1692,4.8202,0.7574,2.1214,0.7285,1.987,0.2762]}

Bahrain imposed a complete ban on Qatari airline services on Dec. 9. The UAE also banned airlines from flying to or over the country's airspace.\nThe four Arab states also imposed economic sanctions, including a ban on trade with Qatar that has since been lifted, but has effectively locked Qatar out of markets and resources.\nSince the crisis began, many Qataris have fled the country, but the government has not allowed all migrants to leave.\nFor more than 10 years, Qatar has hosted a number of migrant workers and their families who come from the southern Philippines, India, China, and Pakistan.\nMore than 200,000 of the workers and their families live in the country's makeshift migrant camps - temporary structures built next to the Qatar-ASEAN Free Trade Area to separate them from Qataris and prevent problems.\nThose camps have been the target of many reports of abuse by police, including beatings and threats of deportation.\nThe group called on governments to give full support to migrants and their families who were subject to harassment.\n\"There is an absolutely devastating lack of support for migrant workers and their families. The government and local authorities are not enforcing domestic legislation to protect the rights of migrant workers,\" Nasser al-Jarrah, Amnesty's executive director in the Gulf, said in an interview with Al Jazeera English.\nHe said that while Qatar was sending a strong signal to other Gulf countries by saying that it did not want to turn into an international border, that there have been some abuses, which he called \"completely unacceptable.\"\nNasser al-Jarrah urged Qatar to ensure that migrant rights were protected in the camps and that migrants were permitted to leave as soon as they desired to do so, without being discriminated against.\nThe Qataris, meanwhile, say they are just trying to do the right thing by their own citizens and foreign workers. According to a government statement issued late July, the Qataris would receive better treatment.","token_len":580,"entropy":[6.821,1.009,2.8893,3.7626,5.6982,0.1645,0.8532,1.4545,8.2467,0.6932,7.6785,0.2473,8.4928,2.2344,0.7436,1.5629,0.449,4.273,6.3614,5.8657,1.2231,0.0464,2.1478,6.9149,0.0875,0.8261,1.419,1.9053,3.3143,5.5036,8.072,1.8899,4.0406,1.4755,5.1386,0.179,0.6005,5.8283,0.4021,0.1434,15.4925,1.1901,5.0386,0.9567,0.6967,0.5397,1.6686,1.7154,6.5854,1.3994,5.4588,0.0065,3.9061,1.4803,0.0018,6.6732,0.0007,3.6829,9.7714,0.4016,2.5866,0.158,2.4725,1.8313,1.2716,4.0655,0.5172,0.859,0.8757,3.6132,9.3878,1.024,10.0251,4.0874,2.8771,5.7468,0.92,0.1917,1.8791,6.9279,3.45,1.4474,0.6408,0.8287,0.2621,1.7548,3.0565,0.6651,4.9587,0.0903,0.2373,2.5505,1.5484,0.8864,5.7331,4.3205,0.3992,4.112,2.2211,0.752,1.366,2.0053,3.5378,4.4482,0.0028,0.5583,2.57,0.0659,3.1567,0.0479,1.2224,1.4053,0.5706,0.0093,0.9194,0.4145,4.6564,7.6666,0.0716,3.5338,0.0766,4.9281,1.8866,1.8149,1.9597,0.6555,2.3611,0.7613,2.4133,3.6589,6.3904,4.5598,11.5105,0.1781,4.7363,3.4731,0.1992,1.0834,0.2612,8.2159,1.5607,0.6657,1.9316,5.9489,3.4433,2.663,3.2779,4.1345,2.4066,0.7514,1.9912,5.3451,2.2394,6.2407,2.8632,1.1665,5.9027,1.4686,6.4656,5.1492,2.5044,0.391,0.3941,6.0524,1.0626,7.6337,0.0006,8.6505,0.9545,0.9509,0.6834,4.8041,2.5646,1.3099,5.3091,3.9624,2.2679,4.5253,5.8232,0.5654,0.1022,1.8482,1.2995,0.0094,3.6554,1.5599,4.4678,4.7595,0.9162,6.8542,0.6977,0.1465,3.4074,0.001,5.4281,3.4436,1.9603,4.878,0.0042,3.2363,0.9791,2.9582,2.4162,2.0164,2.4224,5.1026,0.4154,2.1521,0.7467,3.4078,8.3036,1.5257,1.2884,4.3385,3.8717,0.9381,0.2827,1.867,3.6105,2.7628,0.5851,2.5294,2.5965,4.8787,0.118,3.2449,1.046,2.0505,1.272,0.0476,4.7594,0.9113,0.2259,4.7019,2.606,2.9699,0.2789,0.3144,2.5079,3.8583,3.3924,6.8522,7.0102,2.5815,1.1727,0.0369,6.1982,2.095,6.9598,0.8095,0.3777,4.8989,1.1287,2.6955,0.8113,0.4752,4.6033,3.2973,0.0492,0.3307,2.732,1.3811,0.5694,1.1539,3.2049,2.4075,3.9077,1.0132,2.2461,4.3958,4.9045,3.5622,0.5569,1.8105,1.1713,0.8113,5.1943,2.2863,1.0325,4.4955,0.5628,0.1203,1.7211,0.3418,4.8566,3.0838,2.1908,0.002,3.0586,0.3177,2.4253,3.4831,0.0945,4.2487,5.0,1.0303,2.156,5.9653,7.8142,1.0522,5.3669,0.5271,2.7513,0.6906,3.1426,2.7957,0.4034,0.8827,5.3772,0.0399,3.6792,0.2951,0.0026,2.2452,1.4197,1.679,2.8576,0.4053,0.1489,3.8525,0.1473,1.4053,2.4415,2.2972,7.0977,3.2124,0.5387,5.7204,7.0092,5.0462,2.7252,7.5602,0.0045,1.7652,5.3164,2.0027,9.7514,0.0028,3.3741,0.2116,1.1391,4.5927,6.6172,1.6059,0.0738,3.962,1.4453,1.4339,6.1775,8.7696,2.1178,0.4312,6.5726,1.9336,2.0349,1.2336,3.8916,2.88,0.0254,5.2196,5.6756,0.6096,2.7744,1.9573,3.7813,1.2697,3.6459,3.9888,0.0,0.8888,3.7669,1.0934,3.7701,0.6208,0.5536,2.053,5.1672,4.479,0.8546,4.687,0.575,4.8529,5.1996,3.3917,0.1325,3.2457,1.8146,2.7315,0.028,2.1162,4.1849,6.6233,0.0104,4.8203,2.8027,0.4752,0.9625,4.1055,0.8306,2.9296,6.374,5.9636,3.0126,0.0023,2.3029,1.0052,2.6878,0.0807,1.115,0.2324,0.0476,2.639,1.9384,2.3566,3.2058,4.1343,0.57,1.7883,2.5292,7.6503,6.644,4.3924,2.0366,1.5584,2.3647,1.1717,0.173,0.4542,0.0252,1.8873,7.0234,1.7102,2.0163,0.0728,6.2585,2.1463,0.4271,0.8679,0.775,2.5675,0.0483,2.1165,1.0107,1.5617,0.5807,0.5368,0.426,3.0293,0.7887,1.3828,1.8687,0.2752,3.7397,0.4743,0.2873,2.7064,0.811,2.4817,2.6855,2.3157,2.8683,5.6735,2.7805,1.2779,2.9906,0.934,1.6002,0.1957,1.7721,4.5042,5.3738,1.9628,0.4873,4.0691,0.0226,1.7095,0.5438,5.5329,3.9486,2.4088,4.815,5.7804,0.9949,4.1916,3.7034,5.387,0.2236,3.8795,5.1198,1.9953,5.5879,3.1233,2.123,0.57,5.0007,0.4319,0.9927,0.1535,4.7656,0.1105,0.523,0.0008,0.0064,0.0022,5.5404,2.3133,0.3015,4.429,0.4602,2.4969,6.3704,1.5303,1.4206,2.459,1.1729,5.378,1.4838,1.8455,4.0238,1.2233,6.5043,0.1763,1.523,3.7734,1.4975,0.0047,0.7804,7.6346,4.1605,2.1656,0.005,1.7916,2.816,3.2602,5.4963,0.0233,0.4529,0.2079,2.7286,4.2445,0.5249,2.8559,3.7476,0.0038,3.6414,1.0679,1.1405,6.0056,1.5418,0.0106,5.0558,2.5939,0.3698,0.0132,1.8899,2.6313,2.0861,0.857,1.6792,7.7541,1.7964,0.7085,5.8846,0.0007,2.3083,4.6121,1.5188,1.9277,3.7576,6.1105,0.2133,1.5506,3.0889,0.0616,4.6214,6.2337,7.3354,2.1911,4.6149]}
{"prompt":"Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday she would permit a delay to Britain s departure from the European Union in exceptional circumstances , bowing to criticism from her own party over the government s","text":"Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday she would permit a delay to Britain s departure from the European Union in exceptional circumstances, bowing to criticism from her own party over the government s gamble. The delay would last just over a week, May told MPs before a scheduled vote on her s plan to leave the EU. She said she would like to be given the opportunity to negotiate concessions with the bloc to avoid a no-deal scenario if the European parliament rejects the draft law. On the same day Parliament rejected the draft law in favour of a withdrawal agreement negotiated through a British Foreign Secretary, Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said the government needed an alternative if the parliament rejects the draft law. Hunt also said the government would give parliament until Friday to reach a compromise if they reject the bill. Hunt said the parliament would be given another full day to vote on the law on Friday, and if the motion proves overwhelming then a new vote will be taken. That has already been ruled out by Ms May. Ms May was responding to criticism from Labour Party members who feel that granting her permission to delay Brexit would let the government go ahead waving Brexit in the face of the EU. But others at the meeting said the government intended to continue with Ms May s plan to leave the EU. \"We expect a withdrawal agreement to be put forward for your approval. The agreement you are consulted on (on Sunday) is not the agreement we intend to put forward,\" said a senior EU ally. It is unclear which elements of the withdrawal agreement could be changed in light of the parliament s rejection of the text earlier in the day and the EU s move to dismiss a draft withdrawal agreement the day before. The British government has promised a timetable for leaving and that withdrawal would take place on Oct. 31 and that a deal had been completed. Mr May had sought a two-month delay in a move that triggered intense and bitter criticism from the British parliament and the EU. If granted, the prime minister could take a backseat to her chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who urged a delay and has a strong track record of winning deals in Parliament. But some inside and outside May s Conservative Party are demanding a delay to allow the government to build up a negotiating force and to give parliament a second chance to vote against the government's plan. The EU is set to vote on the government's draft withdrawal agreement at the end of October and Ms May hopes to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The EU has suggested three ways it could accept the plan: by agreeing terms, with amendments or an extension that would give time to negotiate a revised deal. Any changes to the text would have been part of the last-minute revisions to Mr Barnier s text that he had to offer in Parliament after being criticised by the parliament for using a weaker language than the one he had prepared. But a number of parliamentarians have rejected the changes as too sweeping.","token_len":581,"entropy":[6.9938,5.0627,0.0006,2.5108,2.2006,2.0274,2.5643,1.5182,8.8448,2.5134,6.9131,2.758,5.6831,10.086,8.9013,0.5689,0.0517,0.8743,0.0663,2.9744,10.5224,0.1901,1.5516,9.8743,0.2289,0.1284,3.6054,0.7926,3.0253,1.9534,2.1128,3.0438,1.2734,2.8489,8.9752,9.9817,0.5652,4.2798,6.076,1.7483,6.4131,4.8351,2.1691,1.1477,1.075,1.0107,3.08,1.8316,1.9709,3.9499,1.5611,5.7207,2.3044,1.0648,2.6958,6.5428,5.6049,1.3146,0.8346,0.4982,0.6275,0.6393,3.0549,1.0994,1.2819,0.7762,5.9433,0.4988,4.056,4.4643,1.5743,1.8675,0.1308,3.1266,7.7787,1.7859,1.6033,4.0978,4.336,2.1336,1.2746,8.1456,0.2907,0.1356,1.2236,3.0591,1.8382,4.346,4.7162,3.9949,1.2844,6.2644,5.1339,0.5378,5.3849,2.5424,3.129,0.0874,6.6496,3.9924,0.9148,1.4778,0.8505,3.6211,2.8394,0.0021,1.1972,6.5077,4.4181,6.8221,4.8043,1.3513,5.6118,6.8807,1.2714,0.4508,4.69,2.9626,6.716,0.8478,0.7812,1.5836,1.1158,4.6642,4.7809,2.9629,4.5042,1.7051,4.6052,3.9291,0.4498,2.1011,0.6992,0.251,3.0068,2.8612,1.1148,1.5055,0.6433,1.4669,4.8689,4.6455,4.9619,3.5106,0.2556,4.483,0.6512,1.7908,4.0376,4.7832,5.5434,0.2811,2.5619,0.3413,3.6454,0.8744,1.4096,4.4392,1.2854,2.3799,2.7563,4.4928,7.9632,0.729,0.301,3.8531,0.3673,0.3969,2.3776,4.4153,1.5509,1.9662,2.5379,3.883,1.6283,5.7323,6.3228,6.2033,3.6333,2.4997,3.1255,2.1496,2.3651,0.3926,0.9782,1.1989,5.7668,5.0152,3.3124,0.5976,4.5913,0.1746,1.4828,8.3608,0.0061,1.3007,4.1453,0.0225,3.5617,5.2066,0.0643,1.2107,1.0505,2.4639,3.908,1.5668,1.441,6.323,2.2565,8.1882,2.5494,3.8494,0.6554,0.9464,2.475,1.0651,6.3096,1.3443,1.1837,4.7953,1.7988,13.4081,4.9144,3.7766,0.6208,0.2808,0.0065,2.0701,2.6537,1.5669,3.946,5.4506,5.6088,0.3579,2.1654,1.1639,1.4892,1.0876,7.1026,0.119,4.6594,2.5402,6.6,0.0063,2.4943,1.8742,1.4951,1.9006,0.238,0.4075,1.6007,1.9327,1.8333,5.0197,2.8832,6.9351,1.7458,1.7755,0.6021,4.6778,1.221,3.7376,8.1833,3.0147,2.6082,2.6617,6.0816,4.4141,2.3522,9.3641,0.532,6.0901,3.2703,6.7609,0.2219,1.4868,2.363,3.1241,2.8822,1.9737,4.3843,0.2837,3.621,0.3446,1.6915,0.5494,2.4761,2.0309,4.2026,7.6978,0.6108,4.8372,1.2775,2.3895,4.258,7.2584,0.1796,0.2339,5.9327,1.1205,3.9731,0.4963,4.3985,2.8293,5.3331,0.0012,0.6956,5.1475,2.9295,4.7537,1.0583,0.1737,5.708,6.8038,2.2912,0.0791,0.4387,4.5407,1.4286,4.7386,5.2507,4.4656,0.7441,6.4863,3.9624,1.0933,8.0367,0.9183,5.5391,1.2815,0.5259,0.4916,1.6954,4.4423,0.617,1.2199,4.1648,2.9116,3.6415,0.3295,4.267,4.7043,4.4461,6.691,1.8995,1.8424,0.3952,1.6745,6.7338,0.4245,2.9209,3.5069,3.046,2.6092,2.901,4.7977,0.5003,6.1842,1.6522,3.2569,2.1908,3.4416,4.4527,2.2777,3.1714,0.0478,3.1338,0.9121,1.7228,3.6367,4.1224,0.9504,5.5722,4.9909,6.5925,3.2196,2.8608,0.4097,2.1373,3.2314,4.7959,1.9185,1.7696,2.0462,0.8613,5.8043,8.0192,0.5145,0.906,4.3444,0.0046,1.7565,3.8556,2.2307,6.2675,0.7436,0.5443,3.3216,5.5409,2.0892,0.0292,3.4892,0.0001,0.0,1.3626,0.4895,6.9078,2.8438,2.2769,3.1615,4.6096,5.229,2.569,5.1622,0.0006,0.7184,5.2681,5.5985,2.6273,3.8356,0.2969,2.9711,4.2523,6.7513,3.2669,0.0226,5.9597,6.181,5.4643,0.7041,2.5101,4.8673,1.3435,1.8831,2.4745,1.8013,1.2735,0.7313,0.3127,6.125,2.6662,1.7148,3.7841,2.9477,2.5062,2.5054,3.6959,3.1304,1.5802,5.1097,0.447,0.7153,2.0134,4.2636,0.6677,2.2843,0.8231,2.0284,0.6344,2.1457,4.0696,2.7607,3.2702,0.0142,1.8567,0.4395,1.3581,3.1264,0.229,3.0537,1.2539,1.3565,3.3124,1.2244,0.4883,0.0006,2.6135,2.6353,4.3661,0.0024,5.8684,1.0214,5.1091,0.5849,4.8491,0.2162,0.0105,6.1034,1.9751,1.782,2.6058,1.7393,5.1818,7.7226,3.8632,1.9414,0.8556,5.3771,1.1211,5.2384,2.0669,2.895,3.7042,5.705,2.6969,4.6943,9.1358,0.7539,4.4016,3.4764,4.3919,1.0754,3.1594,5.143,1.2806,1.352,1.9134,5.9134,0.8712,0.7732,5.5285,3.9962,1.3045,0.2509,3.6297,1.0989,2.1053,5.1786,5.0377,0.0025,1.0083,5.375,3.3718,0.3465,7.1974,1.2129,6.2489,0.6813,0.0032,4.2336,3.7933,1.5984,2.7796,2.225,2.8387,4.707,2.543,3.5154,2.9568,3.9693,4.8907,0.6949,1.8959,5.9839,1.6996,5.1796,2.1189,7.6052,1.8295,1.4304,1.1999,2.3363,1.2825,1.0189,5.8466,1.4905,2.9967,3.4031,3.6387,0.0573,5.5462,0.1213,1.8701,4.6977,0.9464,5.9288,2.2372,2.4899,7.8682,2.0169]}
{"prompt":"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday that North Korea wants direct talks with the United States to seek guarantees on its security from Washington , Russian news agencies reported . Lavrov said he","text":"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday that North Korea wants direct talks with the United States to seek guarantees on its security from Washington, Russian news agencies reported. Lavrov said he shared Putin's view that direct contacts with the United States should be resumed, but he also said North Korea has a right to be represented at talks in an appropriate way. Reuters said the Russian diplomat was speaking to a joint Russian-backed group of journalists in a restaurant on the outskirts of Moscow, the same day as Russian President Vladimir Putin was scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Helsinki. \"We support the direct dialogue with the United States on the issue of security guarantees for the DPRK (DPRK),\" Lavrov said, saying that he shared the views of President Vladimir Putin that direct contacts between the two countries should resume. Russia is North Korea's biggest trade partner, with exports reaching a record high of $14.5 billion in 2018. The North's foreign ministry issued a statement after the meeting on Wednesday, calling on both the United States and the European Union \"to establish a fair approach to sanctions \"that would promote the country's interests and guarantee the survival of the regime... we look forward to taking these issues to the table at the earliest date \", the statement said. There is no sign of any discussion of North Korea on the latest round of truce talks in Japan on Thursday. The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that if there is no improvement by May, he will stop making progress in negotiations with North Korea. The two sides met in their third round of talks, with the first focused on easing U.S. economic sanctions against Pyongyang, following North Korea's recent launch of its sixth atomic bomb. But Pompeo said the parties had not changed many of their fundamental positions on the issue. U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said the U.S. should \"wait and see whether a more constructive dialogue can take place\". During the first meeting in February, North Korea's envoy Kim Kye-gwan said that the U.S. government should not interfere in the North's nuclear issue. Washington has argued that Pyongyang must stop its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs before it can discuss easing sanctions. The second round of talks took place last month at the U.S. presidential White House, with participants trying to find common ground on several issues including a possible end to North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Pompeo is scheduled to meet with South Korean officials for discussions on North Korea on Friday. North Korea threatened an attack on South Korea after Trump ordered two air strikes late last month at a North Korean military base, saying the moves threatened both countries. Trump threatened to impose even more sanctions on Monday. The U.S. Treasury Department said it would halt North Koreans from accessing financial markets, with Trump warning Pyongyang would face \"very real consequences\".","token_len":581,"entropy":[9.7721,0.7497,0.8537,0.001,1.762,1.2499,2.1976,0.478,5.7442,0.0739,6.1634,8.9072,0.6164,0.5326,0.6232,0.8185,0.0569,2.1064,5.3318,7.8323,2.0001,1.1567,6.4396,5.796,3.2094,1.6437,6.1514,3.2511,0.8747,0.3622,0.2095,4.9505,1.1373,2.8941,6.9088,4.7462,0.0022,1.0216,0.4172,8.366,5.6807,1.4763,0.559,0.3371,0.0044,2.5067,0.698,4.5899,2.5265,1.9279,2.5411,2.4889,1.1058,3.3842,0.1018,2.9884,3.008,2.9619,0.0556,4.0885,5.0305,3.2947,2.5046,3.0058,5.1651,4.3803,1.1279,0.4674,7.1503,4.1134,2.1403,1.6145,2.9041,2.7932,1.6993,2.2742,2.169,5.7283,3.0377,0.5051,9.9265,2.0916,0.3158,4.2587,2.6093,3.2921,5.3699,3.408,0.7154,0.8314,0.0009,2.2513,1.7123,3.2974,2.8812,2.1823,1.4595,4.2589,0.8206,0.0722,0.0062,3.4303,3.2075,0.0117,1.2306,0.8025,1.9861,0.0002,0.0563,0.0038,0.4852,1.0681,0.0033,2.367,7.9585,0.3056,3.1285,1.5262,5.7836,1.238,7.4028,2.2886,1.5335,0.3077,0.4966,0.0023,2.2509,1.2101,1.6646,0.1747,3.1502,5.3103,1.7202,1.4644,1.1243,4.3644,6.0983,0.0042,0.0004,0.2872,0.4995,0.3324,1.8662,4.731,1.554,2.5437,4.6244,1.5931,2.194,0.0775,4.4738,1.9182,0.0385,4.7315,4.214,1.8357,1.5798,0.2984,1.8611,0.4286,0.2562,2.8441,0.7691,3.3752,2.7076,5.283,0.0441,0.0005,3.1277,3.4769,0.0504,1.1219,1.9215,3.3718,3.5227,4.0945,0.2662,1.7112,0.3819,0.8318,4.4135,0.4929,1.8508,0.1,0.8098,5.737,0.9303,2.1245,2.3474,1.9518,4.0219,0.4071,3.3488,0.1195,0.1438,4.0762,0.9198,1.5687,3.0783,1.7198,1.3647,2.5441,1.4522,3.8777,4.2504,1.0215,0.0038,0.0147,1.802,4.2294,0.0059,4.335,0.1111,5.5311,1.0753,5.1474,6.2366,1.0133,5.2811,9.0685,4.7139,2.1067,4.4919,1.767,5.2768,0.0735,4.3018,1.1717,5.1776,1.5229,5.0231,0.1902,1.5432,3.202,7.1289,7.0487,4.939,0.0617,0.0307,5.1087,3.1885,5.4906,2.459,0.332,5.0387,3.6334,0.588,3.2637,5.9785,12.5351,1.2852,0.8264,0.2886,0.0689,5.7602,2.0106,0.6403,3.0069,0.7154,1.7739,6.2149,1.5046,2.7646,0.1198,4.3707,0.5877,5.545,2.0156,0.0119,8.9263,0.4005,2.7921,5.858,3.1629,1.8167,0.9042,1.9123,2.8789,0.0004,0.1717,0.1988,4.3744,0.0017,0.0122,7.352,0.5677,0.0009,1.6226,2.4816,4.1314,3.0258,1.0916,1.5252,6.3546,5.4397,5.9538,1.0122,2.3858,0.9776,6.1291,4.7003,4.9776,2.7772,3.056,2.3874,1.0139,0.0572,0.6635,2.3189,3.3303,0.6648,3.9792,0.7755,7.1429,2.6431,2.0517,0.0413,0.5274,2.3009,2.3161,1.4145,4.2349,7.0599,0.0387,4.1288,4.205,0.0004,0.4154,0.4161,3.8821,0.1564,1.3538,0.6786,1.6139,5.288,4.0914,0.2104,0.0163,2.2341,3.0564,0.0551,2.8357,1.4234,4.9477,1.1772,0.8675,3.8218,5.12,0.0019,0.7204,1.7573,6.9562,2.3849,1.5818,6.538,7.9868,1.7496,0.794,6.3231,2.8044,0.9615,0.9118,0.8806,1.0601,4.4962,0.0005,0.0607,0.0463,6.0662,0.021,1.9758,4.3971,2.0994,1.0948,2.3234,1.8671,0.0004,0.0237,0.0677,2.9168,2.8496,5.7256,0.3952,0.0194,3.4671,4.7495,4.3886,2.1796,1.9335,1.3495,1.4128,0.0094,2.3231,6.016,0.9224,3.7755,2.599,2.8689,5.2932,0.3073,2.5434,0.229,1.895,3.4887,3.908,4.1552,3.9508,2.0735,6.3388,3.242,1.2716,1.2718,1.4219,1.8746,0.0005,0.0221,0.0957,4.2799,2.0139,2.6563,4.1432,0.2907,1.1498,2.4912,0.4444,2.2633,5.6168,1.4551,6.5342,1.3348,6.2568,0.2503,2.6307,2.8644,2.3211,1.1797,3.209,0.1354,1.4548,1.1466,2.0067,1.2244,3.2594,1.0233,0.3965,8.3737,5.7975,1.2835,0.8994,1.981,6.8472,0.6133,0.0973,0.2233,3.3283,0.0183,2.8954,1.1793,3.5711,0.6448,3.1726,0.0011,2.4645,1.3165,6.941,7.5507,0.0004,1.2807,1.7306,7.3961,6.8173,0.0525,3.1727,1.7965,0.0249,1.1791,4.3093,0.5513,2.3028,3.1365,3.4117,3.7933,0.011,1.5824,0.2024,0.012,0.8052,1.7413,1.8045,0.0445,0.6195,0.3341,7.4478,0.0026,4.6624,2.9183,0.0188,0.6332,0.5221,5.0763,0.4373,5.0161,4.6487,3.412,0.6119,2.6271,0.1024,1.8526,1.9361,0.5603,3.0327,0.1688,5.7477,4.4796,0.8102,0.5999,2.8269,0.0878,4.2877,3.8988,4.1171,5.3058,5.3043,0.1421,7.2616,1.1947,0.7577,5.5438,1.204,3.9856,0.0241,1.3463,0.5392,2.3672,2.1807,1.6407,5.102,4.8882,5.398,1.5807,0.8819,2.5629,5.003,0.8818,3.3638,5.4603,0.5366,0.8892,0.6592,9.1111,2.8009,1.9811,1.117,0.0007,0.0892,0.068,3.7232,0.5031,1.0214,1.9742,1.3783,5.3653,5.5761,7.6701,2.5976,5.6037,4.0766,3.5191,1.4968,4.8037,4.5865,2.8631,3.9781,1.9645,2.9918,1.2109,5.2368,2.286,0.3506,1.5482]}

The council also reiterated the country s decision last week to cancel the election commission s mandate.\nThe new president called for a new election that would be conducted by the commission for the October general election.\nMnangagwa said that the previous five-year mandate of the commission had come to an end, adding that political parties could now start their campaign for the October election after the new commission was formally recognised by him. During the election campaign, Zimbabwe s governing Zanu-PF will face stiff competition from the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change and a smaller group of former military leaders who called for elections to be called off.\nPresident Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace have been staying in exile in South Africa in what opposition parties accuse has been a bid to preserve their power.\nThe country s first black president, Mugabe, 81, has ruled Zimbabwe for 28 years, and his grip on power has been made impossible by a deepening economic crisis accompanied by widespread political disenchantment after a decade of growth, particularly in the gold-mining industry.\nHe was forced to resign as president in November after a military coup staged by army officers in which he was briefly abducted.\nThe resignation made no economic impact and his economic policies have continued with little change, leading to widespread unemployment.\nThe IMF has said Zimbabwe s economy faces the possibility of sliding into economic and political crisis unless significant reforms, including a new constitution and elections, are completed before next year.\nThe IMF, which has a US$20 million credit line with the government, expects a drop in its economy in this year s first nine months as economic troubles continue. The government said during the IMF s September visit it would still be aiming to hit an inflation figure of 15 per cent by the end of the year. Analysts and most Zimbabweans now expect the inflation figure to rise well above that.\nZimbabwe will hold its April general election amid the dire political and economic conditions facing the country.","token_len":582,"entropy":[7.2534,0.3819,8.4606,11.9817,8.4453,9.7474,7.0989,0.1687,1.7635,3.2281,7.2786,1.1142,4.3795,1.8046,3.6376,8.3459,1.5697,1.8969,2.9306,1.3037,6.0916,8.3065,12.5217,0.0041,0.0547,3.019,7.3058,1.7806,2.0395,0.0897,0.5245,9.5786,0.0815,6.1675,2.0046,8.5664,2.479,12.6483,1.1749,1.2153,5.7502,4.34,3.5474,0.7212,0.18,18.547,0.0209,8.9883,5.7529,0.794,4.9868,0.1886,0.0199,0.0003,0.0004,0.0001,0.0001,1.9321,5.8794,0.0172,4.773,0.0001,3.9029,6.322,8.9213,4.787,0.0157,0.0056,0.0164,0.3441,3.1129,3.471,2.8028,7.0434,3.129,1.9727,1.1778,4.6421,1.195,0.0164,7.3954,6.7116,3.2082,7.3681,0.1426,1.2977,5.761,4.7844,1.3147,1.272,0.9839,3.2624,4.4324,3.3873,2.1821,3.93,4.7103,2.8545,2.0192,6.0617,5.4,1.3715,4.1444,0.1863,0.2592,2.8784,4.3004,1.5201,6.2104,3.2574,0.0044,0.0038,1.1775,3.5191,0.0028,0.0005,0.0007,4.2746,6.0961,1.6354,0.2106,5.0354,4.9952,0.3244,4.5211,1.7015,3.2493,1.3317,0.0351,4.8488,0.103,0.3862,3.0091,1.3465,1.5108,1.3211,7.6387,1.2413,3.6287,4.8576,7.0462,0.1552,2.21,0.8331,0.6052,0.2076,4.2676,0.0268,3.6252,6.6691,4.8843,8.007,0.11,2.6868,0.0001,2.0327,6.1798,4.2582,6.9577,0.4974,9.5196,7.4361,7.3753,2.3112,2.3946,4.2533,0.0115,0.0094,3.0985,5.8543,3.6965,0.0213,2.2931,1.2364,0.8347,2.3676,2.7995,1.4924,4.7889,1.6911,4.5228,0.1314,0.4956,3.0616,2.538,1.8069,6.2885,2.3203,3.1029,1.98,3.72,5.7098,0.834,0.1968,5.2107,1.1935,3.142,6.7833,7.9017,4.0613,1.8702,0.2233,2.7187,3.3449,2.1634,5.8648,1.6259,1.4541,2.8562,2.7531,4.3146,0.6118,1.7767,3.1822,1.2503,1.5386,8.1446,4.5682,1.1596,7.5909,4.2517,0.5318,0.9407,0.8389,0.8708,1.7651,0.0401,0.0008,0.0006,1.917,2.2365,1.5701,5.8892,5.9869,2.1677,0.4462,3.5993,2.9528,0.728,2.1132,1.2521,5.8503,1.1852,0.1738,0.0072,2.3782,3.26,0.1958,6.4505,2.4613,3.8264,3.2486,4.6331,3.8519,3.3554,2.4662,1.2698,4.2611,1.2981,4.1934,1.3635,2.7219,4.2545,1.6884,4.7133,7.5479,1.4054,8.7483,0.4772,7.9777,0.9476,2.2078,1.1708,0.4899,4.6679,1.0745,6.9621,7.4002,1.2686,0.2164,0.0001,6.8779,4.6195,4.9842,1.8275,0.265,1.2577,4.1299,0.4513,5.2368,0.1469,0.2483,0.0666,2.6075,4.1083,5.4411,3.2811,0.3421,3.3182,2.0512,1.5226,2.6561,5.5844,0.2865,4.715,2.4398,1.3128,4.6586,5.3355,1.2453,0.2978,5.256,3.2402,0.001,0.0004,2.8291,0.9934,1.7962,2.738,2.5709,1.2846,6.5498,0.6592,4.6944,0.4901,3.1999,0.0585,4.095,3.623,6.6399,2.6309,3.7795,6.878,0.0682,0.4183,2.9792,0.1101,5.5684,1.4239,1.4796,0.7593,0.8615,2.1672,4.2307,1.6353,4.6713,3.7125,0.1665,0.668,4.3829,0.0001,1.0743,9.7242,0.2222,3.6417,3.4293,0.9778,1.1537,5.1573,0.0373,1.8362,2.5758,2.5669,7.712,0.1644,0.2141,0.4503,0.9118,6.7067,5.9544,0.5337,1.9627,6.4171,0.9617,0.3682,7.6442,0.0159,4.5051,3.5091,5.9278,4.077,0.0058,0.0049,5.1777,2.3488,3.7219,0.2327,7.2237,3.2157,4.1365,1.0106,0.6965,6.998,1.4848,1.2801,1.7668,0.3561,0.609,3.6411,2.3032,2.7473,0.3821,1.2374,3.1551,0.5464,0.6593,4.0886,1.3584,1.931,4.8951,0.2494,7.2682,0.4135,4.7485,2.2464,2.3202,3.5333,1.2396,1.1465,6.1399,7.8711,1.5831,0.9651,2.0748,5.3946,6.4989,3.6104,8.4224,1.8505,2.339,3.3038,6.2343,3.1383,0.9507,4.1577,4.8114,3.2073,1.5931,2.5705,4.5645,0.5918,3.205,3.7768,1.6716,0.8004,1.9835,6.4943,1.9826,1.6236,2.212,1.895,2.1101,6.3232,3.2003,5.0871,0.0194,5.7303,1.2491,4.7723,3.2204,1.6039,1.7437,3.8915,6.2325,0.9189,5.4802,0.9114,2.039,3.5002,1.4247,1.2191,4.9778,0.4706,0.1566,5.4972,2.4302,3.8177,0.3952,1.8431,0.9299,1.7864,1.6374,3.5779,0.7497,1.3646,3.6925,7.2403,0.2252,3.6455,4.0509,7.0561,2.0674,3.2436,1.4307,2.3099,0.5479,4.4689,2.9575,5.1025,0.1744,4.2393,5.8556,1.7646,5.9284,0.3679,7.5149,1.9952,5.8878,0.215,3.2927,3.6825,6.2186,1.782,1.3217,3.2401,3.1268,2.6031,6.1535,0.9777,4.7379,4.2404,7.1166,6.16,2.6389,1.3167,5.1354,2.0443,5.9058,0.6815,5.0111,4.5712,2.3237,6.8546,0.1297,4.8737,2.5414,0.0009,1.7906,1.1102,0.1662,0.0017,1.2723,0.1144,0.5776,8.3102,0.0001,4.8878,6.7549,4.5268,0.2315,5.5922,1.4709,0.941,3.8887,1.7286,0.1242,1.9831,5.7867,1.0213,2.6131,1.7725,0.7812,4.1445,0.0354,5.0356,3.399,1.1092,5.7417,3.2676,0.2323,6.74,2.8977,6.8524,3.3806,3.8778,0.38,1.6385,3.9591,0.4216,0.273,0.9071]}
{"prompt":"Britain wants to reach an agreement with the European Union that would secure a frictionless border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland to avoid any need for queues on either side , junior Brexit","text":"Britain wants to reach an agreement with the European Union that would secure a frictionless border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland to avoid any need for queues on either side, junior Brexit minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said yesterday. He confirmed a report in The Economist, which said Britain was not prepared to sign a transition period agreement until the end of the year or until after the 2019 general election in Britain. Mr Rees-Mogg told ITV\u2019s Andrew Marr show the British government wanted to secure an agreement before Parliament was dissolved on 12 March, \u201cso that if there is a deal or no deal, we can operate normally for the next two years, with the Northern Ireland border operating.\u201d \u201cBut there cannot be queues or border checks,\u201d he added. Mr Rees-Mogg, who is also the shadow Brexit minister, said a Brexit transition deal could last between 18 months and five years at the end of the transition period \u2013 depending on what parties in Britain could agree \u2013 as well as including checks at the border to protect the Irish economy. The Northern Ireland Secretary, Mark Harper, said the new Brexit deal should \u201cavoid the need for a hard border and the associated queues and disruption.\u201d \u201cIn the spirit of the Agreement of 1998, it should be possible for goods to move freely, but people should not be able to move freely across,\u201d Mr Harper told the BBC. \u201cWe need a clear, comprehensive and ambitious deal to avoid a hard border and all of the associated queues and disruption, and a clear, comprehensive and pragmatic agreement to ensure the economy does not suffer.\u201d\nThe United Nations secretary general, Antonio Guterres, said that the COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented opportunity that must not be wasted to increase global food availability. He spoke during the World Food Summit on Monday, and said that the world should be able to produce 2,000 billion kg of food annually by 2050. \u201cCOVID-19 must not become a disastrous pandemic of hunger. The world must seize the opportunity presented by the pandemic to reduce hunger and advance our shared food security goals,\u201d he said. Guterres also called for the suspension of debt repayments and the cancellation and\/or postponement of loans to those countries who are not in a position to cope with the global health emergency. The secretary general said: \u201cMany economies will suffer a double fallout because of the economic damage wrought by COVID-19 in the short term and the increased vulnerability to natural disasters in the longer term.\u201d The new coronavirus has killed more than 1.2 million people worldwide and there are signs that the world is about to enter a recession. The WHO has warned that the number of people experiencing a serious hunger emergency is likely to double as a result of the pandemic.","token_len":582,"entropy":[8.4494,0.4718,6.562,2.665,0.266,0.9944,1.1704,2.4116,0.5337,2.8163,0.9092,6.1518,1.7611,11.1117,0.0269,3.2557,1.6699,4.7197,1.4908,8.3933,0.0704,3.2718,0.0106,4.6609,3.0104,3.1282,5.8323,0.1934,9.9611,2.7696,5.2751,0.0502,3.6315,11.2026,4.7888,2.3195,9.976,0.0101,0.1245,0.0004,0.0001,0.0001,0.3988,3.5049,0.1187,5.7148,5.5808,2.8688,4.8419,2.3496,1.1099,7.4507,3.591,0.9457,1.304,5.0536,1.9107,4.3263,1.9557,0.1311,4.0098,1.3603,6.4854,4.5735,2.3757,2.9648,1.9751,1.3568,0.0058,1.0195,0.9862,4.7904,3.3316,4.9367,0.9438,4.586,0.769,0.0397,3.7182,4.0435,0.5333,3.8175,0.1069,0.0007,0.0034,0.0015,0.0006,3.1163,4.3167,16.4315,10.1047,4.4257,3.7155,0.0052,0.0002,2.1041,2.787,4.819,0.489,3.7224,0.4648,3.8774,2.4017,0.5041,2.471,5.3655,2.8963,5.1802,2.4616,4.7663,2.32,2.4669,12.6773,4.4886,5.593,1.2652,4.5309,2.6814,1.3849,0.831,2.8517,6.0636,2.8258,0.4606,1.0283,4.0775,0.707,7.5018,4.4751,3.2597,1.1067,1.6232,1.8595,0.2055,2.689,3.9105,1.6459,5.5934,0.2751,1.4056,7.6246,4.1218,4.3636,7.7672,4.2951,0.4773,3.4779,3.074,6.9467,0.0874,10.7992,3.2089,4.4887,1.9108,2.2931,7.0223,2.7699,0.9467,1.5046,0.2069,3.5675,0.0423,0.002,0.0015,0.0009,0.0006,3.7692,0.6755,1.5398,2.0286,1.6625,3.6551,1.3581,1.8246,0.1615,0.5442,3.3601,4.4485,4.9803,3.7112,2.2159,4.8645,3.6106,3.8507,0.5775,0.3631,3.6901,0.0191,5.3128,1.4899,5.2273,0.0068,0.8809,6.8036,0.3073,6.0128,5.8067,0.0286,2.8758,6.5817,3.3488,4.4184,6.2495,0.6362,5.8814,3.9915,1.2411,0.0061,7.6109,6.5575,3.6766,1.1349,0.619,2.9464,3.875,1.6089,3.8868,3.1497,0.652,2.5621,4.0031,0.0778,2.9859,1.8952,4.5959,4.2352,0.087,0.7824,1.8244,4.5947,4.4817,0.8176,3.4811,13.2446,0.7613,6.0371,2.0846,2.2659,0.2417,1.6147,4.8804,0.1668,2.6717,3.1315,6.6808,4.2634,1.6814,5.6578,2.1159,3.3626,1.0873,1.6013,0.122,4.0215,1.6963,6.3905,0.0011,1.5361,6.4409,2.5769,5.1642,0.4732,3.9142,1.7052,1.3086,2.0375,1.1002,7.529,1.2021,3.8448,1.9856,4.0505,2.9012,6.5057,1.8763,0.9774,0.8227,2.8175,0.0136,3.0554,2.147,2.2102,6.31,0.5582,1.3499,2.126,1.0304,1.9175,1.6006,1.4971,0.6332,2.9782,0.3086,3.686,2.1131,1.9164,4.1515,2.4948,3.9789,1.1705,7.2705,2.5252,1.9293,3.8166,1.6912,1.0566,0.0886,1.7198,4.7978,2.4212,0.593,2.2948,1.2257,0.6623,0.2962,1.8891,3.4085,3.0807,2.3467,1.9514,1.2522,0.5618,12.2951,2.3382,1.4206,1.5824,2.4258,5.0563,3.4668,0.0551,1.3855,2.2469,0.5344,0.2828,2.4366,8.995,5.8783,3.6239,5.0901,0.3736,0.4547,3.5151,0.0042,0.0001,0.0001,0.2591,0.804,2.8733,1.5194,12.549,11.8575,5.2288,6.6106,14.2725,0.0315,3.5675,3.106,5.0988,6.47,4.0973,2.6145,2.7816,0.537,4.8874,5.4914,6.0873,4.2763,4.4625,6.7131,0.7841,1.8295,6.389,4.1987,1.3191,5.5558,0.3605,1.2543,2.9843,2.4236,1.5761,3.1366,1.063,1.2259,1.436,3.1173,3.6145,2.0992,2.3681,0.0262,4.488,5.4476,2.1624,0.7722,2.2968,6.089,0.4006,0.2143,4.2827,1.3947,1.1093,0.9824,3.6123,0.3685,7.7691,0.0045,0.3551,0.0514,4.3462,2.1301,3.8761,0.5486,9.3331,4.2386,0.0024,3.8945,5.4481,2.2029,2.7082,2.8198,1.9555,6.501,1.3492,0.0832,5.4131,0.1338,1.3125,5.2653,0.0018,1.7569,3.1899,1.9295,1.4555,7.8248,3.8627,4.6465,2.1189,0.1422,2.7769,1.6204,1.4597,1.4478,1.1089,0.3114,0.1298,5.9213,0.0072,0.0001,2.3977,2.6627,0.6844,1.8297,7.3457,0.0335,9.5943,2.8728,0.0048,2.1246,2.0238,4.8766,6.3339,6.8852,0.0003,3.5583,0.0024,0.0216,5.3073,1.1029,5.4982,1.8479,3.4507,1.8674,1.8023,2.6632,2.1568,0.6952,0.0192,6.1641,0.3591,0.5636,3.6525,7.5081,4.0178,0.5755,2.6837,4.8651,0.1157,1.1532,2.7418,0.7934,0.2115,6.2857,5.2668,3.7527,3.0545,3.2971,6.6303,9.8108,4.856,0.3,0.9177,4.5159,4.9727,5.6312,0.1871,1.6053,0.0081,0.0744,0.0122,4.0289,0.9286,3.1211,0.5544,2.043,1.1917,5.0489,4.0035,1.8652,4.8733,0.3183,2.7373,0.1933,1.8854,0.0361,0.263,1.1579,0.2831,2.5349,4.8731,12.4032,1.914,1.0616,4.1484,3.4763,1.5776,0.1667,2.4249,2.1482,2.4494,0.1243,0.0574,2.2215,1.8285,5.0774,0.8496,6.2096,0.6071,1.8587,5.0745,0.8536,3.8718,0.0046,3.8075,0.5994,6.1767,0.6382,2.3679,3.8211,1.8495,1.1811,0.292,1.6905,3.5746,0.0177,1.4873,6.0846,3.3917,4.1298,8.9539,3.841,2.0296,1.9825,0.0132,1.9342,3.195,2.1362,0.2471,0.2398,1.1017,0.8192,0.0046,0.5287]}
{"prompt":"All four members of the British government s Social Mobility Commission have quit accusing Prime Minister Theresa May of being too fixated on Brexit to improve the prospects of those from poor backgrounds . May","text":"All four members of the British government s Social Mobility Commission have quit accusing Prime Minister Theresa May of being too fixated on Brexit to improve the prospects of those from poor backgrounds. May had called the group of experts who made 11 recommendations to increase social mobility. But her team now includes Labour cabinet ministers, with Brexit Secretary Michael Gove named chairman and Cabinet Office minister Priti Patel coming in as vice-chairman. Mr Gove said the social mobility commissioner\u2019s report, called \u2018The Imperative to Reduce Social Inequality\u2019, was \u201cclear and unambiguous on the importance of addressing social mobility. The UK needs to invest much more in social investment than we are putting in now\u201d. Ms Patel, vice chairman of her party\u2019s Brexit negotiating committee, said: \u201cWe support the importance of investing in those communities that, regardless of background, want to succeed. Social mobility should be the centre of Government\u2019s reform agenda. We must have a national debate on this so that we can set clear objectives and goals\u201d. \u201cMs May is taking on a far larger reform of our system than any other government has tried before. As a result, her cabinet, and her political party, cannot be doing the right thing. This is why the four reformers \u2013 an economist, a former minister, a social worker and a local government worker \u2013 are retiring at this late stage. They are leaving because, in this crisis of public trust \u2013 and especially with the new threat of Brexit \u2013 the government cannot afford the fallout of a policy that has already failed to tackle inequality\u201d. They also criticised the report\u2019s suggestions that public spending should be spent more on schools which are \u201cnot proven to be an effective way of increasing the social mobility in the UK\u201d. They criticised its advice to lower the earnings threshold at which people can claim child tax credit, and called for a full-scale review into the policy since its introduction at the start of the decade. There have been protests against Mr Gove\u2019s plans to make schools open for fewer hours, which the Conservative Party said were a way of improving teaching standards. Conservative education spokesman David Wigton said the government would not be allowed to \u201cattack and swoop down on schools like vultures\u201d. Meanwhile, Mr Gove said there was evidence that there was growing hostility to the Conservative Party and its policies, including a surge in anti-Muslim attacks.\nRacism is growing in America. Not, of course, as a result of Donald Trump, the racist, sexist and islamophobia-laden Republican presidential nominee. The root of America\u2019s racism is deep and systemic.\nIt comes from the racist, sexist and islamophobia-laden Republican presidential nominee Trump and the president Obama and the GOP who have been complicit for generations.","token_len":582,"entropy":[7.6355,4.4195,0.2786,0.4769,6.5322,3.5083,10.6894,14.875,5.6913,3.0607,1.9887,5.3354,10.6803,4.8483,0.0044,1.3043,0.001,0.0942,3.0605,2.3231,8.2208,0.0006,0.0212,3.377,1.4832,7.9792,1.1419,4.9594,0.4832,3.7199,7.6441,6.0264,1.2597,0.5594,6.8781,4.2967,3.8209,1.9721,5.8955,2.5772,5.2679,3.2151,4.9513,10.5536,0.2275,1.7413,5.7506,3.9181,0.3198,2.1668,2.7768,3.7643,3.4603,4.4364,5.7069,4.0707,6.0363,0.4884,1.5128,4.3328,6.4405,1.9215,2.9172,0.1749,0.0,6.1463,5.644,3.1806,6.1753,2.4155,0.8679,7.893,0.1344,0.0009,0.0007,5.5899,0.757,0.7632,3.9935,0.68,0.1243,0.3011,0.2963,4.8816,1.5697,0.0003,2.2355,1.483,6.8451,0.2814,4.3089,15.8873,8.9606,2.0461,2.6714,3.4284,5.1759,11.6286,6.251,3.2397,9.9825,0.1586,3.4005,3.8859,2.461,5.1846,0.2015,1.0151,1.5491,1.0004,1.1689,10.9945,4.3597,6.1184,4.3767,3.1854,0.0289,4.1077,1.1293,3.3076,0.0428,4.5985,2.1247,0.2246,2.4511,2.1544,5.7816,3.5123,0.4613,4.1342,5.8662,0.0503,0.4656,0.8075,7.2898,4.6603,1.746,1.9357,3.9006,0.5555,5.4233,2.6989,8.0203,4.2247,6.6747,4.0113,2.8442,7.8931,3.1168,0.5187,7.3065,3.2336,4.3608,0.2842,0.0274,4.5765,6.5148,2.4503,0.1542,0.5094,1.5499,3.0646,3.1146,1.9124,6.5682,1.0212,6.0044,0.0629,3.6844,0.482,6.033,5.0338,1.4777,6.0481,5.1075,0.0007,4.2187,0.237,4.9072,0.4964,5.2206,1.428,6.203,0.1801,3.0875,0.5214,2.7521,4.8337,1.4877,5.9101,1.5509,0.4943,0.467,7.031,0.3747,0.7259,1.8222,3.2729,4.1417,1.2798,4.2696,5.0897,1.1265,2.2592,5.3273,0.5337,1.4409,0.4935,5.5963,3.789,3.3937,1.7203,5.0324,1.7791,5.1618,0.2011,3.9875,0.7908,5.3373,4.755,2.5928,4.7655,3.7643,1.7066,6.2506,3.2005,9.742,6.323,2.1226,3.2848,2.3139,3.0555,1.6633,2.369,2.4493,5.0579,3.7715,0.5558,4.3464,1.6934,0.8364,0.4357,3.2352,5.0797,4.0031,3.1434,2.1109,4.4991,3.348,0.5377,3.9214,2.1603,5.6274,1.9346,1.4796,0.188,2.3434,3.3817,1.1145,2.4442,2.4231,6.876,5.8493,0.8767,6.4782,6.9516,4.5308,0.3376,0.4638,3.6139,3.5709,0.5945,0.6519,2.3634,3.244,0.8447,0.4666,5.2054,2.8279,2.8802,0.2863,1.4417,4.9969,4.3903,3.6776,3.9697,0.7053,0.6582,2.2832,1.6861,2.2986,2.6239,4.1968,2.3257,4.2076,5.6411,2.2007,3.3185,3.8734,6.3369,1.5731,5.6088,4.3991,1.131,5.1522,5.5591,0.3535,1.0292,0.6043,2.3696,2.5345,2.1349,2.6873,3.6779,8.4501,1.2283,2.1844,4.8567,1.3751,1.8177,3.3467,2.8895,1.8786,4.2926,3.0084,4.4249,2.9515,0.1286,3.58,3.8385,8.3982,0.7244,4.9862,1.9952,0.4346,0.061,6.0896,0.5355,5.0034,1.3214,1.6136,0.4728,5.0989,2.449,0.7865,4.0735,6.317,1.9044,11.5326,0.8214,3.2769,9.4643,0.3622,1.1634,4.2967,0.3793,1.2242,0.9383,3.7312,1.8978,2.8893,0.342,5.33,1.7215,0.7213,2.173,0.2584,0.2023,1.9361,3.9032,5.0442,6.0443,1.7728,5.6447,1.1579,6.5568,2.3557,3.9366,0.3575,1.4228,1.2797,2.3537,6.4465,3.1719,2.266,1.7643,2.0354,4.0976,0.6796,1.5716,4.6795,3.6538,1.5792,1.9399,3.1606,1.044,4.8969,7.1401,2.8565,2.2899,5.1734,0.3042,1.8029,0.0081,1.1402,3.6565,0.1873,4.9544,2.981,0.2587,5.6318,3.651,4.5601,0.1303,0.0005,0.9695,0.2349,0.0138,4.3123,0.4707,3.9759,5.2476,5.0665,2.4396,9.1038,5.1822,1.348,3.2116,3.1664,4.777,3.0788,3.4833,2.6892,2.7526,4.8186,0.5126,4.4223,5.2668,2.8187,0.6636,5.4766,5.0591,0.541,3.4076,6.7549,4.7622,6.1084,0.5752,1.8148,3.3037,2.2917,2.1629,1.896,6.4138,0.0561,9.3101,0.6373,8.2062,4.4645,12.7986,3.672,0.1882,4.7491,5.1738,8.987,2.2349,0.0023,2.3803,1.222,0.7609,6.7539,0.2046,2.5112,0.5679,0.0054,1.9591,3.7917,0.8449,3.9994,0.6839,3.9672,0.7236,4.5247,5.9733,1.3261,1.6948,5.2395,2.2346,2.4838,1.3,1.5189,2.2735,2.067,3.1774,4.9253,0.1485,2.4943,0.007,4.0218,3.2216,1.3283,2.6792,10.6022,3.5571,0.0566,2.5087,3.5016,0.8855,6.4925,2.028,7.2364,7.514,3.2036,0.0026,0.0066,3.0684,4.0125,1.1112,0.0051,3.0909,0.0126,2.6225,2.7125,5.605,1.5064,2.4539,0.9754,9.9473,0.6301,7.259,3.7517,4.113,2.7835,1.045,1.2146,0.4644,2.7264,6.1805,0.9582,4.1366,3.9219,2.9335,0.0985,1.49,1.1912,4.6298,1.5155,3.3887,0.5524,3.5807,3.5268,4.5335,0.6576,1.1931,4.9875,1.6325,0.3266,0.4572,0.2445,0.0173,2.3963,2.0516,0.8437,0.9575,0.1314,0.2686,3.9174,3.773,1.8499,6.8045,7.6406,4.2538,1.5803,4.5869,6.0093,2.0157,2.5946,4.7887,5.4628,4.5229,3.739]}

station in Egypt and supplies of nuclear fuel, according to a statement of the presidential palace.\nThe statement said that the Russians agreed to provide energy to the plant at an average price of $1 billion a year during the first years of its operation, and the amount would be reduced at each successive year by an additional amount of about a quarter.\nThe Russian side has accepted financing a portion of construction costs through a public-private partnership mechanism of 25 percent to be paid by government borrowing and 75 percent by a Saudi-led World Bank loan, the statement said.\nIt added that in the beginning there is also the possibility of using Egyptian private financing for this investment.\nMoscow has already signed an agreement with Cairo for the construction of two such plants over the next 10 years, one located in Alexandria at Egypt's Mediterranean coast at a cost of almost $1 billion, and the second in Assiut province in the northern Nile Delta.\nThe statement said that Russia has also agreed to continue to supply nuclear fuel for Egypt's nuclear power plants.\nIt also said that a series of additional agreements in the energy, defence, information technology, humanitarian and cultural spheres had been signed, without mentioning the details.\nThe visit comes at a time when the United States has urged both sides to resolve their disputes to avoid any risks to relations.\n\"Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has arrived in Russia... to discuss ways to deepen economic ties and the energy partnership,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\"The meeting is aimed at laying the grounds for further strengthening relations in defence and security, humanitarian, economic and other areas.\"\nIn a sign of the importance placed on the bilateral relationship, the Russian Foreign Ministry on Saturday described Egypt as one of the most important countries with which Moscow wanted to build economic co-operation.\nThe State Department in Washington said that the talks between the two countries \"will be devoted to opportunities and measures of economic and political co-operation.\"\nSisi arrived to Moscow for the visit on Sunday afternoon and will meet his Russian counterpart on Monday, the statement said.\nEgyptian media have reported that the Russians have prepared a document in order to sign the agreement before leaving Russia, but Egypt will hold talks with the Egyptian parliament to sign the agreement during the visit.\nThe statement did not include any details of the two agreements mentioned by the presidential

{"prompt":"The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee on Thursday cleared the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee of charges that he had disclosed classified information , potentially clearing the way for him to resume leadership","text":"The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee on Thursday cleared the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee of charges that he had disclosed classified information, potentially clearing the way for him to resume leadership of the panel despite the scandal surrounding the leaks from a whistleblower.\nWATCH : A White House aide has resigned after confirming she was fired by U.S. President Donald John Trump because of her political opinions on the Russia case. In a letter, Kellyanne Conway, former campaign manager to Trump, called the firing \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and asked Trump not to dismiss her from the administration.\nThis week we have a wide array of games, from RPGs that focus on customization and combat to games that feature characters and adventures that have been featured in popular literature. A lot of games this week are in fact crossovers that take their inspiration from different genres. So, you are in for a truly wide ranging experience. You can see my rundown below:\nDark Souls is a game that takes many of it\u2019s ideas straight from the Final Fantasy series. But instead of having only one class, you have many available character classes with varied gameplay. The game has a great variety of combat styles and unique weapons, as well as numerous monsters that can be defeated. This is definitely a game worthy of a playthrough at some point.\nWhile Dark Souls is a game with great combat, Danganronpa does take more of an adventure game approach. You\u2019ll be playing in a city filled with many different types of characters, each of them have an arc storyline of their own. Some characters will fight you while some will attack you from behind or give you hints about your purpose for showing up in such a place. You\u2019ll also get to encounter many different types of traps and puzzles along the way. The game starts out pretty slow, however once you start defeating the boss that you\u2019ve been fighting for the past level, every boss fight feels great. If you give the game a try, it certainly won\u2019t disappoint.\nTales of Berseria features a hero who takes on the monsters like a god, while being capable of defeating them in less than no time. With tons of different weapons that can be used, you\u2019ll have to put a lot of thought into using them intelligently to beat the enemies and traps along the way. You will also eventually find yourself exploring a dungeon full of different enemies, bosses, traps, and puzzles.\nSo, it\u2019s clear how both Dark Souls and Danganronpa have their inspiration taken directly from their Final Fantasy inspirations. However, both Tales of Berseria and Final Fantasy XIV have characters that are much more unique and are far from any final boss fight. In the end, both are solid franchises and you can enjoy their games regardless of your Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest sensibilities.","token_len":582,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2998,0.4341,0.0098,7.2101,0.0409,3.2524,1.837,5.4419,1.6451,6.7111,0.2098,0.5819,1.2326,4.5538,0.0314,0.7111,3.441,1.7,0.7278,2.9702,5.3373,0.4329,0.1048,3.6341,6.0395,7.7998,0.8709,0.2384,0.0475,3.2025,0.0239,6.1611,6.2119,1.2754,0.1954,3.6138,6.3397,2.1183,5.1723,3.0413,1.622,6.4529,3.5639,3.2912,5.9342,0.6708,0.1483,25.7302,7.4165,4.2388,4.5918,0.0016,2.9177,4.12,3.3119,1.2707,7.3831,3.6607,1.0338,2.459,2.1093,5.5876,0.0011,0.0011,0.0025,1.8972,0.1244,10.7884,0.0105,5.1355,0.5775,1.2231,4.554,3.8795,2.2128,2.103,1.8725,6.2726,0.8896,5.2829,1.0155,1.7583,2.5064,6.0439,0.0001,0.0,0.0014,1.6189,4.3164,1.9353,0.5788,4.0035,1.7637,0.4839,3.1799,0.7846,2.2786,15.2646,7.6798,6.8471,0.1226,0.4044,1.242,6.8677,2.1505,3.5567,3.7419,2.6909,0.0667,5.0648,0.9265,2.8295,0.4096,3.7689,0.3442,1.103,9.2844,3.2391,6.0571,3.2345,2.0364,6.7592,2.9618,0.0021,8.7359,3.5285,2.3807,11.3182,4.3051,5.4232,0.1456,8.6231,1.3574,3.6019,0.868,4.4601,0.7588,4.4698,3.8493,2.3813,7.2145,0.9996,3.9084,3.2168,5.939,0.5457,4.0784,6.892,0.9814,4.8058,2.4652,0.1393,2.8546,5.7864,1.4256,1.9184,4.6633,3.0165,10.1189,0.1169,0.0001,2.8427,3.4234,7.8091,2.1715,0.0429,5.3435,1.6357,1.3971,4.3731,2.0558,4.0167,4.828,3.99,1.8723,0.4626,6.5534,5.3787,5.3639,2.3947,1.0101,3.7636,2.3798,3.2392,4.3088,7.3476,3.9897,2.033,0.2757,6.7271,0.8313,3.2263,1.2462,2.4873,0.9473,2.794,6.0412,1.7063,7.988,14.6584,6.6443,2.015,3.2228,7.4313,0.4638,0.6433,8.121,0.002,0.3128,0.98,4.5686,5.0823,0.0604,3.885,6.5525,1.2287,4.5377,0.9713,1.8945,1.537,3.1673,6.9947,6.7538,0.2896,3.537,5.7062,4.8266,2.0119,2.4055,1.6551,2.3353,1.6996,4.0136,3.2908,0.2268,3.881,1.453,1.4022,4.9079,3.5132,1.6769,2.9046,0.0628,0.0551,4.788,5.8264,1.9929,1.2866,0.9011,3.1825,1.9715,3.5688,1.1958,5.385,1.0524,0.6116,6.7365,0.0256,1.8725,5.5118,5.2709,2.6548,0.0332,0.6491,1.0293,5.5265,2.8136,0.0144,1.063,1.2365,2.2824,2.8727,3.4,3.3087,0.8752,8.4084,4.3444,0.0606,0.0,5.9611,5.2756,5.3517,1.0049,2.6305,4.7191,3.6747,0.8458,0.6612,2.8259,15.3571,2.3116,0.73,1.8539,2.192,3.627,1.0085,3.039,2.8476,0.0143,5.0223,1.1946,3.0581,0.0138,3.0289,1.5841,2.5653,2.3482,2.1261,4.841,4.9886,5.8432,9.1501,4.702,0.3503,0.0003,0.3072,4.0459,2.3209,2.6074,3.91,3.3197,4.1315,3.61,0.3869,4.0065,0.2957,3.6726,0.7816,3.2491,5.9229,0.4827,4.9498,1.6648,2.4865,6.8591,4.0783,8.1327,0.6138,1.8665,6.0712,0.6724,3.6504,0.1141,3.2423,3.3971,0.3334,0.02,2.5438,3.4172,0.6195,5.628,2.4142,0.8338,2.1505,0.0188,5.7198,0.9662,3.3576,4.7135,0.0796,0.0071,0.4075,2.7294,1.0687,6.2584,1.6381,3.4992,3.8029,0.9363,5.0804,3.8826,0.2179,2.6628,6.8955,2.0742,3.5573,5.1909,2.4092,5.8895,1.1048,3.0709,2.5303,3.8248,1.1332,2.1137,1.7642,7.8433,1.1249,6.5162,4.7319,4.6753,3.9954,4.906,0.3455,4.4595,0.1667,6.5726,1.6835,2.4806,0.9231,1.842,0.4149,1.8296,5.8847,2.5041,2.7854,1.0154,0.0762,1.8293,0.4199,0.5088,5.7301,2.2716,0.3931,3.7839,0.1541,5.2775,1.0884,7.2455,1.4502,4.468,0.7795,1.3168,7.1817,6.2396,1.8912,5.62,1.8412,4.4351,5.6494,6.4097,0.0301,4.8363,0.7165,2.0088,4.7843,0.445,8.0646,0.0077,0.1338,4.9522,5.9501,0.0303,2.596,3.6846,3.5401,1.0724,0.4292,1.0941,2.0681,1.4417,3.523,0.1885,0.1352,2.0723,1.5177,5.2911,2.7477,0.5182,0.0557,1.2513,0.1392,4.3395,1.1034,9.1867,0.0025,2.4025,3.5661,1.2891,2.7623,3.3355,6.8092,6.0252,0.0411,0.0042,0.0691,3.0256,1.4675,0.9822,6.0405,2.3056,0.9864,6.0065,1.9221,2.5092,2.3673,0.0023,2.9314,3.174,1.5841,5.3852,0.5338,2.7572,0.6219,0.5824,3.5722,0.7397,1.6989,4.7057,0.6357,3.5283,1.8999,0.5552,0.0205,4.0137,5.8185,7.1906,2.4806,0.0467,0.0682,0.642,0.0001,0.0029,0.0006,2.3223,3.9546,5.0289,6.8161,5.2722,0.0123,4.1523,5.0893,0.0014,4.7525,0.0009,0.1777,3.4502,0.0478,4.379,9.6072,0.0543,0.0586,0.0002,0.1809,5.8254,0.0039,3.9072,1.8335,6.6856,0.595,1.3477,3.9812,0.408,3.1971,1.2411,4.7342,4.7648,3.2534,6.8233,7.9421,3.1138,2.472,0.8497,3.5091,2.3944,1.8707,0.2904,2.6246,2.7639,6.1973,6.5125,2.5288,4.7064,1.7843,4.683,3.3042,2.4007,5.3765,0.2424,1.765,7.3274,0.0028,3.288,5.3171,0.628,5.3788,0.055]}

Zinke said that while some minerals produced in Colorado and other parts of the U.S. \u201care already very rare,\u201d there are vast amounts \u201cof minerals under explored\u201d elsewhere in the world. \u201cWhen countries like Saudi Arabia mine the world's vast oil reserves, other countries have to pay them to do it because we have so much supply, but we don't have a lot of use for it,\u201d he said.\nA U.S. government study of potential minerals threats released in February found that U.S. minerals dependence on overseas sources is \u201clikely to increase rapidly in the future \u201d as China and India become increasingly wealthy. It finds that China and India could become independent of coal within two to three generations. However, minerals used in the electronics, computers and military industries are the U.S.\u2019s most vulnerable to loss of supply to outsiders, it found. \u201cWhat you have to recognize is these are not minerals that you can cut back on without serious downside to everything,\u201d Zinke said. It is estimated that the U.S. has about 3,600 minerals to choose from, including titanium, rare earth elements and diamond. It could also threaten the nation\u2019s infrastructure if they were lost completely.\nZinke said the proposed effort will focus on the four key types of minerals that are at the heart of U.S. electronics manufacturing \u2013 tungsten, cobalt, lithium and rare earth elements. At a Wednesday press briefing, Zinke said that the proposed research program will not be aimed at extracting minerals on U.S. soil. \u201cWe're gonna really leverage the universities, because we know universities are at the forefront of research, and so what we're trying to do is to bring in our own research, but it's trying to make sure that we're also pushing forward the discovery here in this country,\u201d he said.\nZinke said he doesn\u2019t believe that China will impose any restrictions on U.S. minerals export and investment that would impede American technology. \u201cYou know, we do need to remain very vigilant about that because if we don't continue to have access to all these minerals, what happens is then I can't build the computers and the computers and the mobile phones and the military tools that we need,\u201d he said.","token_len":582,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,7.6776,1.6164,0.4957,0.0,0.0001,3.1596,2.0501,6.4289,1.3057,3.2343,0.0414,4.5737,4.9462,0.0006,0.0007,0.0211,4.5555,0.0091,1.586,7.9823,0.8297,7.3236,2.4937,6.1583,0.5226,8.8175,1.3794,2.7606,0.5216,5.6367,1.4251,1.6619,3.2281,3.4504,0.6539,6.8751,0.427,0.8102,0.0358,1.9476,0.0241,1.7927,2.7425,2.3866,0.0973,0.2149,19.789,0.0017,0.0031,3.4974,1.0336,4.8182,0.3888,1.0815,14.6442,7.547,5.5267,3.6943,0.4236,2.9742,4.8687,3.254,7.4594,1.9657,1.0223,0.7517,1.9843,5.2189,3.686,0.8421,0.2111,3.8781,1.2027,4.03,0.0135,2.69,2.0523,11.4856,0.7546,4.7671,1.7317,2.0693,3.0076,4.2523,6.6967,1.6893,1.7094,7.3806,0.5021,4.9416,0.5293,1.0972,4.0334,0.001,1.0977,2.4511,2.814,4.133,2.6999,4.5183,0.9287,4.6939,3.4583,1.3928,2.8826,0.0009,0.1322,2.0365,0.0003,0.0004,0.0656,13.228,0.5923,2.6192,3.85,6.9651,3.3219,0.4894,8.14,4.6976,3.6634,0.8874,7.2165,2.0555,7.2855,0.0877,1.5186,2.0881,6.4138,11.0829,6.1996,0.2625,5.0466,0.7603,0.0649,0.1826,0.9494,7.8687,0.1345,6.6828,6.0197,2.9012,2.811,0.0015,8.4483,3.1896,2.682,0.0462,4.1452,5.5457,0.5819,0.4604,5.6568,0.3835,3.3536,1.4028,2.8606,5.5545,2.2422,4.8567,2.4338,5.854,5.3265,2.4549,3.356,0.539,5.8672,2.2307,2.5881,1.929,1.1977,0.0113,0.9674,3.3004,1.2769,0.473,6.3222,0.9146,1.398,2.2356,2.5662,1.5425,1.7431,0.1872,0.1688,0.2192,5.2232,3.5337,0.0006,0.018,0.0833,3.853,3.525,3.0709,6.1156,4.2388,10.6135,4.499,1.5488,2.7327,1.5607,0.288,3.6376,0.0004,0.0016,0.0692,3.6352,7.8325,0.8473,4.9678,1.3346,2.2192,8.5286,0.582,6.231,0.7412,1.2276,5.9039,1.7556,0.2159,1.4895,3.2597,3.7184,2.7425,3.6651,1.3653,1.3064,3.6496,1.3114,6.1958,1.8802,4.8556,6.191,0.1799,3.7031,2.179,0.0816,4.3013,3.0056,6.7272,1.762,7.5424,7.8223,3.5248,1.2511,0.6622,5.0308,1.4433,5.191,0.0148,6.6715,4.4963,0.4364,3.3767,5.8963,2.697,4.2343,0.3938,1.4874,1.8334,1.6199,4.8816,6.6226,0.0006,0.001,0.6521,7.1269,7.0476,1.7466,1.4291,3.9038,0.9493,6.0775,0.8053,2.003,4.4104,6.6342,1.4849,4.5886,1.2049,0.1087,4.4979,0.4158,6.5739,4.3967,3.279,2.2951,5.9197,0.4056,6.014,1.1132,2.4903,3.4177,1.0398,2.605,1.7733,7.0282,3.8941,0.3847,5.326,4.6001,7.1416,2.2906,8.2117,3.3963,1.0586,1.4176,1.9953,0.0012,0.2392,0.1704,4.9532,1.0409,5.8999,0.0615,2.0124,0.9328,0.0005,0.0007,0.0482,2.7785,2.5564,3.5808,0.9912,3.4312,3.1021,4.7652,4.3342,0.0084,1.1148,2.9652,6.1393,0.522,4.4812,0.1795,2.7617,1.1638,4.7295,0.7892,4.2762,3.5896,2.5804,8.3594,1.706,3.8334,3.3658,1.0275,0.3357,5.104,2.6327,4.2979,4.0258,4.1652,7.7183,0.9251,0.3949,2.1811,0.0005,0.0033,0.931,1.7863,5.4182,4.7536,1.7021,2.1974,0.1717,2.59,6.0729,3.3431,5.1906,0.0528,0.4302,1.7485,1.3742,4.3318,2.1396,1.766,0.0012,2.5049,0.0004,0.0005,0.1013,7.2805,2.5691,6.0736,6.2748,0.0071,0.0059,0.1064,4.2919,0.0001,0.0735,5.0826,1.4069,5.3102,0.0233,0.8501,0.3631,6.0187,2.8411,7.821,0.7896,1.9484,0.3119,1.1165,0.0006,0.5505,0.9559,1.5625,4.2382,4.5423,3.3728,1.0173,4.0383,2.1473,4.3219,0.13,5.012,3.7457,5.5925,2.4939,0.0005,0.0003,0.1466,0.5559,1.2823,5.5169,0.2059,4.7379,1.8647,5.6625,6.4715,7.2695,1.7468,7.4746,1.4966,5.3116,1.1615,2.6222,7.4018,1.0825,5.2359,0.5071,1.0747,0.1863,2.4776,2.3173,1.6364,3.6718,4.2676,0.2398,0.2719,2.8208,0.0194,0.0838,0.2264,2.0598,4.0024,2.6439,4.8628,1.5814,1.6619,2.081,3.6161,3.3748,0.5607,7.7613,0.0253,3.2641,0.4711,0.6534,1.0578,1.073,5.2849,5.0154,4.5046,2.3784,6.2168,7.5539,1.2168,3.64,0.1786,1.4828,1.8546,1.4653,0.7896,0.1373,0.0337,0.3684,1.9267,0.0004,0.0027,0.9672,2.431,5.2675,4.8235,2.0061,0.0088,2.1601,0.7512,3.9493,2.1573,7.1211,2.0679,1.4275,0.0883,1.4317,0.0003,0.0007,0.0646,2.8894,6.5923,3.8243,3.4207,5.2039,2.0461,4.53,4.0123,4.6698,2.1941,3.7536,0.1752,4.896,1.8094,0.1707,1.8634,3.999,2.8444,0.5391,6.7676,3.7261,2.9152,1.0706,3.359,2.5922,2.9902,1.0079,2.1639,0.5433,5.1415,0.2487,3.5348,2.6909,0.0509,3.9499,1.6513,1.0218,0.7053,4.489,3.0982,2.4912,6.4264,5.5315,3.8404,0.7531,5.0531,3.0039,5.74,1.6806,1.4766,2.1038,2.9466,0.5014,8.3638,0.7483,1.132,1.0098,3.1905,4.6648,1.4439,0.6616,0.8578,2.5651,0.9284,0.3956,0.2651,0.0895,0.0267]}
{"prompt":"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Saturday denied that he was leaving his post to be replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo . Asked if there was any truth to the multiple reports about","text":"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Saturday denied that he was leaving his post to be replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Asked if there was any truth to the multiple reports about his intended departure, Tillerson said there was nothing official on the matter. \"There's nothing official right now,\" he asserted during an appearance with the National Security Council.\nTillerson has been tapped for the position by President Donald Trump. An influential aide said the president is hoping he can draw up his own comprehensive plan for Iran.\nIn February, Trump said he would withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which went into effect 2015 after being negotiated by a committee of five nations including the U.S. The Trump administration has also announced the United States would reimpose tough sanctions on Iran.\nI had never met the man who turned out to be Barack Obama\u2019s long-time adviser, Rahm Emanuel, and had only read articles about him. I was pleasantly surprised when I went to interview the former Chicago mayor. Rahm had been one of the first people in my life to teach me that it was okay to work things out for yourself, even when it hurts someone else. As a young man who had dropped out of high school Rahm told me that I had to make it on my own. He showed me how to write my name and taught me how to handle a checkbook. To this day I carry a checkbook on me and don\u2019t write any of my own checks.\nIn fact Rahm taught me more than a few things but I will focus here on his perspective about women. I remember an op ed that I wrote for The New York Times about whether women would feel more secure in an America run by a president like Donald Trump than an America led by someone like Hilary Clinton or Joe Biden. I said that I could not answer that question because I did not know what a president Trump would do with women. I was wrong.\nThat night after reading the article, I stopped by the office of The New York Times to say hi to Rahm. \u201cHello.\u201d I said. \u201cOh hello,\u201d he said as he quickly brushed past my desk without even giving me a handshake. \u201cHow are you?\u201d I said. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you still need to ask us that kind of question?\u201d he said. I asked him what he thought of the first woman in space, the first woman governor and the first woman to receive the nobel prize for peace. He didn\u2019t answer but he was clearly ticked off. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Rahm?\u201d I asked. \u201cI don\u2019t like women.\u201d he said.","token_len":583,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,3.3584,3.1218,4.2619,1.3767,2.8354,2.0137,7.5476,3.2954,1.2374,2.4149,3.9388,3.1886,0.281,7.2446,0.5153,0.6721,0.0,0.0001,0.7493,6.4089,1.332,4.127,0.5635,0.7764,3.8984,0.0627,1.1284,8.6216,1.4592,2.7194,2.3482,7.9707,1.111,0.2792,0.343,0.5215,3.5834,0.3593,3.7874,5.7599,3.6218,0.9653,0.154,0.2584,2.3963,2.4154,1.4289,1.1147,0.9229,5.1664,0.0117,0.6632,0.381,7.7821,5.2571,1.3777,1.2962,2.8066,2.8,4.1243,1.5043,0.0507,0.7171,0.9352,15.8295,0.0031,0.0001,3.1112,1.4345,4.8925,2.5581,1.0496,2.9704,1.1234,1.0517,0.8152,0.0077,1.8898,6.0741,5.5078,4.52,2.7249,2.1798,2.7216,2.0795,4.81,3.5434,0.6507,5.9957,2.5993,4.1214,0.9014,7.6811,0.6503,1.3253,4.8157,2.5038,0.8344,7.8235,4.3359,0.123,1.8329,2.4482,0.7998,1.0253,3.8778,0.8793,0.1624,2.9978,2.322,0.791,0.4628,1.2801,6.0646,0.0968,0.4014,1.6269,0.0012,0.0037,0.0031,0.0005,1.0104,2.306,6.6094,0.0094,0.0908,10.0299,4.3006,5.2483,2.6146,0.9028,3.7668,5.0316,0.1605,3.5847,2.8702,3.0921,0.6614,1.5287,0.0005,0.0829,1.0183,2.8555,3.4145,0.1129,0.9411,2.4932,4.6082,3.5265,4.3982,0.0901,1.2791,8.9721,0.005,5.2,0.7983,0.4818,0.4263,1.3167,0.5892,7.7256,4.5387,4.4536,1.4681,2.5873,1.8373,0.7669,6.3298,1.9964,0.0692,0.0577,6.4338,0.0223,10.8059,7.1588,5.7678,7.0296,0.2084,0.7442,3.9529,1.9156,7.8464,0.0027,0.0524,1.3858,1.8657,3.8684,4.2719,4.7531,6.185,1.0485,0.7732,2.403,1.9805,2.5604,6.172,0.0164,1.6555,1.0902,4.6987,0.3462,6.915,4.6026,2.8474,2.5598,1.0008,1.6806,3.8433,0.0037,4.2905,2.0126,3.2814,0.0166,0.8843,2.9956,1.4372,3.3581,1.2626,1.7838,0.4046,6.918,0.7132,3.3201,3.914,1.2168,3.6646,0.1334,5.2836,7.3732,0.0484,2.9701,2.073,1.9846,2.4302,1.9879,1.8107,6.7506,4.9485,0.6098,0.5611,4.6309,1.5963,2.1829,0.8997,3.5302,1.6946,7.0975,0.0811,0.0552,1.0303,0.0031,14.4942,0.0023,4.9594,0.0501,2.2964,3.6884,1.8263,1.6794,3.7516,2.9774,4.6699,0.1049,0.006,0.7616,2.153,5.9854,0.0717,1.8396,0.443,3.9489,4.7439,4.1262,2.6382,7.6095,0.0118,1.0071,0.0461,5.8161,2.9189,7.2929,1.7097,0.549,5.9416,2.7676,0.0133,1.0448,6.3144,1.3991,3.1735,0.3393,2.7309,1.8601,2.4829,5.3568,11.8016,3.5793,0.3462,4.5601,4.2742,2.4772,0.9454,1.1722,4.319,0.4698,1.9105,3.3568,3.5086,4.2578,0.0019,2.7329,0.0319,6.2507,1.5714,3.0837,1.477,0.6098,6.045,1.8563,5.8844,7.5546,5.5562,0.2249,2.5498,6.3862,3.9553,7.523,1.4754,2.7044,4.334,5.7353,7.8309,4.0756,2.2431,2.343,1.3803,1.4584,2.3436,1.1047,0.1726,0.0571,2.2979,6.2187,1.9907,4.5443,4.768,2.8618,2.8607,1.4517,3.3715,5.1574,5.5389,0.1231,2.5779,4.1601,4.8657,2.4484,0.0599,4.6152,3.9913,0.467,4.603,0.0106,4.2141,0.5953,5.0901,0.0049,0.0268,3.0539,4.6543,0.0223,0.1676,1.5387,3.2727,1.4662,2.1571,3.9676,1.5142,5.8405,0.9602,0.3796,1.1457,0.8125,2.5055,0.0165,1.0511,1.775,3.8836,2.3114,4.5002,0.4637,0.4834,2.2619,0.6436,0.6341,1.4895,2.3234,3.7865,0.4559,1.3329,4.9151,4.6496,4.2674,4.1226,1.2586,2.7845,0.781,0.5459,5.3073,1.4136,1.1521,3.3315,0.1417,4.6597,0.9133,0.0699,0.0429,1.1482,3.8776,2.846,0.758,0.7363,0.0038,2.0215,10.4701,5.03,9.064,1.4671,3.9122,7.4725,1.8319,4.3808,6.0787,1.5734,0.4906,4.6485,5.5615,2.1743,5.9504,2.11,2.5927,0.7353,3.527,0.794,6.9422,6.9083,1.9677,3.6432,1.5391,6.7571,3.4486,4.8099,0.406,0.3547,5.7317,0.2241,2.3482,0.1386,4.2742,1.0962,0.1612,0.8574,1.0754,0.3703,1.4843,0.7666,1.0083,0.6308,0.0362,6.8953,8.5478,5.7235,7.1865,4.6691,2.1472,0.5251,0.4569,0.8832,0.4635,0.8841,1.6569,0.0411,3.7973,2.3089,3.6995,3.6144,0.3527,4.1077,5.459,4.6066,5.67,0.0166,0.3774,4.363,1.2587,0.2275,4.6884,0.6948,0.5122,2.4245,2.3315,0.7015,1.9071,0.8181,1.2418,1.3331,1.4842,5.5943,2.7343,2.6359,9.3884,2.0119,3.2554,1.1958,1.1315,8.5405,3.6693,1.4899,0.0993,0.6657,3.3686,5.5732,0.9998,11.8059,6.3631,1.921,3.1612,5.0662,1.2616,1.4363,4.2668,2.2352,1.2041,0.0127,1.2693,4.5202,1.6771,3.3737,4.9566,6.4552,1.4982,0.4546,0.8864,3.0523,0.1708,2.707,3.7636,2.3074,0.972,2.0004,2.4974,4.2307,0.0017,1.2877,0.8338,0.1077,0.8587,0.6341,0.4115,0.2731,0.0357,2.2219,1.7217,0.3331,0.3004,0.0083,3.3688,2.5218,0.9419,1.3272,0.1456,2.8475,0.2901,0.184]}
{"prompt":"An Iraqi military parade in Baghdad s heavily fortified Green Zone celebrated final victory over Islamic State on Sunday , with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi looking on as troops marched in formation , their bodies","text":"An Iraqi military parade in Baghdad s heavily fortified Green Zone celebrated final victory over Islamic State on Sunday, with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi looking on as troops marched in formation, their bodies painted bright red with the symbol of their death.\nAn Iraqi prime minister congratulated his loyalists on Sunday after a last stand against Islamic State that ended the militants\u2019 territorial rise across vast swathes of Iraq, giving Iraq a sense of stability.\nIt should be noted that the US-led coalition declared victory on 25 May 2014, while the Prime Minister of Iraq was praised by some for his decisive decision to surrender and leave the country in 2015, to save the government from collapse. In an international conference in Kuwait, Abu Dhabi in March 2015, the foreign ministers of 28 Gulf countries declared the Islamic State \u201cterrorist group\u201d, as well as their support for Baghdad, despite their failure in the battle against ISIS. This decision to support the Iraqi government, with a strong army and navy, and support of its neighbours, can be seen as the key factor that has allowed the government and its forces to win the war. The support of Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and others, made it possible for the Iraqi army and Marines to fight and defeat the ISIS terrorists in the battlefield, despite the fact that the group lost more territory than ever at the expense of the loss lives of many Iraqi soldiers, as well as US Marines deployed in Iraq to fight ISIS. ISIS terrorists have tried to keep their control over areas across Iraq, and even neighbouring Syria. However, the defeat of the extremist group, and the subsequent victory of the coalition, allows Iraq to stabilise itself and prepare for the next phase of the reconstruction process, as well as for the country\u2019s future development.\nThe victory over terrorists and their control of major areas in Iraq means that the country will move to focus on the reconstruction of society and rebuilding the country\u2019s infrastructure at all levels. In this regard, the Iraqi government has signed agreements with many governments, including the USA, China and Germany, to help reconstruct the country\u2019s infrastructure, and it has also agreed with the IMF and the World Bank on programmes for improving the welfare of the people of the country. The victory of the Iraqi army and coalition forces has encouraged more countries to help the Iraqi army and the government. There are rumours that many countries are interested in supporting the Iraqi army\u2019s and coalition\u2019s operations in Syria and elsewhere, and that this may be more than the military contribution. This supports the view that the victory of the country and its forces, as well as the creation of the security and stability conditions, are the cornerstones for the reconstruction, the economic and social stabilisation of the country, and the creation of a new system for government and administration which will be based on democratic principles.","token_len":583,"entropy":[9.7262,3.6844,6.8999,1.0446,2.856,10.1484,11.16,2.2056,7.4417,0.0131,11.9786,9.0933,0.6061,0.9219,3.1194,0.0015,3.2007,1.9759,1.4197,3.7442,5.5865,0.0016,0.3507,0.0,0.0037,0.0019,0.0,0.0,6.2875,0.6854,1.5345,3.7911,4.9244,1.3566,5.8019,3.7446,3.6779,5.9079,7.0987,6.6429,0.4637,3.6476,0.8819,5.6518,0.0184,3.0952,6.7813,0.367,1.2906,17.9185,0.2115,7.0421,0.0226,8.0157,1.644,6.2073,2.4809,0.933,2.9721,1.5094,2.2426,6.8773,3.6519,2.4744,0.5309,0.001,5.1733,4.3315,2.9098,3.3809,17.2227,7.699,11.897,7.6779,4.8967,6.675,1.2316,0.0002,0.0186,0.4699,1.874,6.2856,3.8761,1.6875,6.2931,0.0366,3.0193,1.5291,0.3352,4.3154,6.8016,0.8548,0.9573,0.2656,1.2879,3.9977,1.8008,0.0572,0.2528,7.1834,3.5857,2.0347,7.3331,2.4572,6.2493,1.0973,4.2071,1.2134,7.389,0.0104,2.4017,0.6991,3.8602,7.2586,1.1505,3.694,2.3637,1.0215,4.8036,3.9285,0.7441,6.7407,3.6483,4.4027,1.0567,0.7855,2.5241,4.5487,2.3461,4.6091,4.2321,1.1855,4.3999,1.2836,4.4204,0.3426,4.9369,3.5435,5.2823,2.9574,1.4023,3.5392,1.0853,4.7555,2.294,3.7858,3.0543,2.1639,0.2189,1.7659,6.1589,1.3432,0.3632,6.7015,3.8565,1.5879,4.1764,2.4265,3.6118,0.0146,10.2565,5.2054,7.6205,0.4916,1.8562,7.9115,3.6271,3.8329,1.9703,0.0201,3.6824,5.1166,0.3056,5.2979,1.7013,8.1641,3.1813,4.0283,2.934,2.2624,2.336,1.5073,3.8871,0.6004,5.1441,4.7716,3.8639,4.2163,0.5824,1.4062,1.0409,2.4168,4.0713,2.9248,3.2251,4.6461,0.9743,4.0646,0.431,3.6083,3.7668,2.1108,2.9395,6.3774,1.2633,6.502,1.1965,0.4728,0.2286,2.5437,4.3805,2.5528,1.9098,3.0793,2.5816,0.4376,3.6836,4.0086,0.9175,4.1432,0.1205,4.2447,1.2208,1.5581,1.1833,3.0664,6.2672,1.3509,7.5082,1.0477,2.2766,0.4668,2.8187,0.5572,2.9158,0.6228,3.4138,0.5531,2.4465,0.3883,1.6683,0.0008,1.1153,3.595,1.8496,5.0098,1.4389,1.0823,0.5991,0.4891,1.7021,1.2959,1.7377,6.2147,0.1847,3.4307,3.4223,2.817,0.9572,4.1355,3.1025,2.1338,1.4198,5.9557,1.8275,3.6277,0.9297,2.6024,0.0579,1.1918,4.271,6.0132,3.5763,2.8244,0.6823,4.5437,6.1031,0.4511,6.0952,0.0024,0.808,9.8993,11.2261,1.4155,3.2475,1.8165,1.4538,2.2029,4.1567,0.3107,0.0159,6.018,3.6282,6.6285,1.2263,1.5155,1.9955,2.1893,2.8636,0.5043,6.9621,3.929,1.8626,6.3625,0.1916,5.3826,2.1143,4.3674,2.5014,4.0984,4.4236,0.7931,1.3985,2.1088,3.8826,7.3043,0.9586,2.3064,3.272,0.0837,1.5031,4.7133,0.1675,0.8981,4.6918,0.2925,2.8742,2.0629,0.5697,3.972,4.9215,0.6063,0.7051,4.0682,1.2361,5.4636,3.6036,0.2487,7.5552,0.0198,3.4051,1.4379,5.7611,0.1499,1.3675,1.9725,1.2371,0.2414,0.5166,6.7003,1.3144,1.8481,2.7019,1.2272,0.0118,3.3088,0.8133,5.2014,7.8892,1.3963,5.0086,1.1096,4.886,0.6394,0.8258,1.8011,4.1094,2.3933,6.6081,2.7946,1.9225,4.965,0.823,5.1153,2.1373,1.7372,0.4781,4.3798,0.2423,0.8776,2.8966,2.0147,4.9549,2.1638,6.3321,0.2429,1.6917,2.676,0.5232,4.7316,1.2391,5.7694,1.7411,1.3702,2.3285,0.1445,0.4166,1.4755,6.7897,3.0584,0.4071,0.9978,2.9754,2.6995,1.6326,0.1155,0.8406,2.5514,0.8229,1.6304,6.0624,2.6187,0.3855,3.8163,4.7694,1.5139,1.0007,0.7631,4.6002,0.4913,3.9968,1.5102,4.087,0.4021,0.8952,2.4148,7.0308,0.6129,0.3713,2.4877,0.0268,0.0866,0.6663,1.3912,2.0293,3.6467,1.2385,2.2242,2.6842,3.0796,1.0767,4.9402,1.1546,1.3751,0.6827,0.0096,2.6828,7.2254,2.1916,3.5053,0.9751,5.4078,0.3795,0.7507,1.5047,1.9739,2.2801,0.1686,0.5406,1.7079,5.7056,1.5104,0.4096,1.2572,1.6563,0.766,9.417,1.4337,2.8143,5.8865,4.8451,3.7144,0.4375,3.9384,1.4559,1.1094,2.6675,0.5637,1.7546,3.151,3.0159,5.1293,1.1085,9.9522,0.2982,4.0519,1.7325,1.578,3.5669,0.0352,2.903,0.3368,0.5442,0.9704,4.8199,0.0099,0.0281,4.7758,2.9415,8.7814,0.0314,0.0524,4.9455,0.9407,2.3393,1.0257,3.8379,0.9552,1.6255,1.6443,3.3783,2.9368,1.1083,5.266,1.5809,2.758,3.071,4.5597,2.1599,3.3762,7.2567,0.3701,4.6272,0.1642,0.7934,4.0685,0.7538,0.2899,5.7763,1.8776,1.5724,3.1299,2.6855,2.9691,0.202,0.0059,0.6115,5.9701,0.0309,2.5205,4.6085,2.195,1.1934,4.068,2.2638,2.506,1.9272,8.8666,0.0192,2.7299,0.7006,1.9858,5.0541,4.173,5.3496,1.7072,1.167,4.9393,0.0303,1.2824,0.3765,0.0969,1.0238,0.3315,0.6971,3.8989,0.0295,0.8343,1.7015,6.52,2.3252,5.1926,1.3792,5.9996,4.2006,0.955,2.7095,2.3438,0.1506,2.7942,2.4657,0.9062]}
{"prompt":"Four people were killed and seven were missing after a Philippine ferry with 251 people on board capsized during bad weather on Thursday near the capital , Manila , disaster officials and a coastguard spokesman","text":"Four people were killed and seven were missing after a Philippine ferry with 251 people on board capsized during bad weather on Thursday near the capital, Manila, disaster officials and a coastguard spokesman said. The passengers were headed for a island off southern California when the ferry capsized after departing from the southern city of Legaspi, the Philippines-based Coast Guard said on its Facebook page. One person was found dead. Rescue teams rushed to the scene, but the ferry had drifted too far away to find the survivors. In an effort to increase safety standards, the World Maritime Organisation said in June last year that capsizing of vessels in similar scenarios due to heavy seas was no longer a good idea for a safe ferry voyage. The Organisation's General Assembly decided to remove capsizing from the list. When ships are sailing over rough seas at high speed, wave effects can shift their centre of gravity, causing them to capsize. A ship also can capsize if the bow of the vessel is damaged from an impact with rocks or debris in rough weather. The worst cases of capsizing have involved high-speed vessels that capsized against a reef, but capsizing is a problem for smaller ferries as well, the group says. Maritime accident data, including some of the most lethal ships, are part of a research project being led by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The aim was simply to assess the number, type, and impact of capsizing incidents. The data showed a number of factors contributing to casualties, including speed, depth of the water, the time of day, the weather, and cargo on board, says the IMO. The data does not include the specific type of vessel involved, but most capsized vessels on the oceans are small ships less than 5,000 tons capacity. They are usually vessels carrying bulk cargo, mainly timber and cement. However, in the worst cases, they carry passenger ships. Capsizing takes place in rough seas when a vessel loses control and becomes unstable because of the current and force of wave breaking. The vessel then capsizes, plunging it over and below the water line and sending a wave back that can injure passengers. The most tragic deaths in capsizing have occurred when vessels are travelling at high speeds. When those ships hit a reef, it can destroy the bow of a ship and capsize it. Capsizing can be deadly if the vessel loses its trim after the bow and keel are damaged, and the vessel loses its balance. The vessel may become unstable, spinning as it plunges. Vessels carrying passengers, such as passenger ferries and passenger liners, are the most susceptible to capsizing. Such vessels cannot navigate with their engines, so they rely on the wind for propulsion. But strong winds, whether from rising tides or powerful northerly winds, can make it difficult to maneuver, or cause a vessel to become unstable and capsize.","token_len":584,"entropy":[5.8291,1.2368,1.1487,0.997,4.2457,1.547,4.7321,2.4646,0.9376,10.1582,6.9588,6.1815,9.2129,1.0873,0.7939,0.0639,1.9637,0.001,3.9197,6.7636,0.0097,1.2838,3.0769,4.7889,0.855,4.6983,1.6001,0.4964,0.7284,7.9707,0.4056,5.5441,3.66,4.3695,0.4128,2.3583,0.103,0.1147,2.6451,5.0389,1.2221,5.8072,1.3311,1.8935,6.1878,1.9627,4.4679,4.1397,1.9243,0.8084,2.11,0.9379,0.0035,4.7038,6.9167,0.4223,1.5,2.8762,2.4753,0.0498,9.0914,7.0915,1.7265,1.5228,1.8209,4.2127,5.0891,0.1603,4.4893,0.1115,0.2072,2.7722,1.6772,0.9952,0.0578,0.1844,4.6639,1.3677,0.5463,3.8695,0.6006,2.3235,5.2777,2.2248,4.0032,0.236,0.1957,0.3269,1.4857,1.5287,2.101,3.3238,2.7443,5.0692,2.6909,0.94,2.0351,1.4505,5.3373,1.8623,3.7593,1.1778,5.4026,3.0117,3.7371,0.0104,6.9939,2.4783,6.7626,0.5358,1.0433,6.7946,3.8408,2.4084,2.3728,2.5919,4.3741,5.9925,0.0285,0.3912,7.8784,0.2624,2.1887,1.9182,2.3441,8.6353,7.2755,8.9098,0.0023,5.0009,1.7372,1.8748,4.688,0.199,1.4992,5.5706,0.2394,4.5902,3.9664,4.9402,5.217,5.8011,0.2473,1.8661,5.4158,2.6499,6.9067,2.3902,5.0015,1.3134,5.0056,1.98,0.4824,1.6458,0.7443,2.4244,5.094,6.2423,5.9111,1.6686,4.6388,4.245,3.4752,0.2471,4.8698,1.7162,1.5418,0.3209,9.4431,5.7794,1.1876,6.1261,3.1881,7.8978,0.2228,0.0613,1.445,2.5096,1.4318,0.0091,7.7539,0.1021,1.1674,3.3488,4.7068,5.777,3.2402,3.2336,0.006,2.9781,1.9189,7.3721,1.1437,0.9005,0.7076,0.7317,2.9188,4.5261,3.9729,2.0741,1.4179,5.343,0.8467,2.4926,4.1857,5.2703,4.0062,0.5362,1.7978,4.8893,3.2575,0.9845,0.9354,0.1535,2.822,3.7469,5.0384,0.4687,0.5644,3.6888,2.3519,4.7946,0.0492,7.3751,2.6397,3.5318,1.5865,3.8356,6.7788,0.6289,2.7317,2.9237,4.7075,1.322,1.6898,6.8134,0.0001,3.467,1.2314,1.6277,1.9683,4.2311,3.8103,0.0687,6.2282,4.4696,3.4376,4.0111,2.7885,5.6044,2.4175,0.1881,2.5102,7.407,5.545,1.401,1.8202,6.0754,0.004,1.1876,5.2566,0.9948,3.485,2.7852,0.0378,0.8633,2.532,0.3636,0.7838,1.0868,0.0067,0.0046,0.789,1.2947,6.4342,4.0474,9.5338,0.0175,4.0948,0.6721,3.853,4.3965,2.4813,1.556,0.7789,4.2287,0.5088,3.9543,1.1208,1.7764,1.454,1.5552,4.139,4.2455,2.9254,3.9804,0.0133,3.6935,3.3122,0.023,7.7817,1.1999,0.4728,4.9921,0.868,3.807,1.2505,1.0219,1.6216,0.4318,2.4747,4.6505,0.7955,0.7877,0.7072,1.7102,3.4153,0.9503,0.6941,6.427,5.0197,0.5079,1.8028,5.2057,1.4102,0.7972,0.001,0.8818,1.6283,3.6487,5.3207,0.0334,1.1919,1.6607,5.7294,2.4926,0.1777,0.9684,2.3386,1.057,1.5623,4.6455,3.9475,0.4995,0.9249,5.1587,1.2464,7.3072,1.6435,2.4717,3.0916,7.959,0.0125,3.3564,3.0107,0.0777,2.0459,8.1962,0.7973,4.6891,1.1828,2.5174,6.586,3.3186,6.7833,1.1316,1.448,4.7982,6.4432,1.4162,4.823,0.9975,5.1343,0.0186,3.0962,1.8891,1.953,0.4682,0.4992,2.4441,3.9563,6.1993,2.8669,2.1311,8.7379,0.3971,6.1102,1.8469,2.2653,4.1594,0.6954,3.0646,2.6769,0.9125,5.3094,2.374,2.3346,4.2108,1.7691,4.7243,0.337,1.788,5.0528,3.1656,6.7264,0.2763,5.8755,6.5237,0.9168,1.6153,2.6574,3.3764,1.2495,0.0092,1.5292,5.4718,0.0867,2.9847,4.7391,5.0321,4.5593,0.4636,2.5435,2.9425,2.3778,4.3177,2.3846,1.4869,3.1069,5.9924,2.8245,4.2526,3.4639,1.2829,1.5026,4.3905,5.66,3.2244,3.044,3.2544,0.8959,2.1552,1.5802,2.3589,3.2738,1.738,3.9406,1.5003,1.6192,1.1705,1.9373,4.5588,5.6898,2.6315,3.4086,1.5332,0.3721,0.7366,3.798,1.4341,5.5732,1.2471,5.2826,0.7056,1.8877,1.6027,1.7651,5.5979,0.1323,1.7239,0.9985,6.9703,0.2101,1.9272,2.3096,3.2204,1.8584,1.4055,1.2493,4.5607,2.4517,10.3743,4.6672,2.1252,5.6446,4.1259,7.8655,0.0083,1.4405,1.8303,1.5811,2.7851,1.7403,2.7289,3.6077,1.3294,3.6881,1.2941,1.7341,3.0295,3.2697,3.6855,1.7944,2.1407,7.1106,4.0725,0.5583,5.1896,0.0001,1.7416,6.0876,0.0925,4.1214,2.909,2.8333,1.8025,0.0007,5.1352,4.0092,0.0002,1.5869,4.0882,5.6353,0.0565,0.1146,1.6971,3.8306,0.6506,4.0966,0.4673,0.5504,0.069,0.6641,6.3386,0.7073,5.1815,6.0151,3.2472,2.1019,4.3552,3.5995,2.4426,0.8066,6.4322,0.1781,2.2562,4.0198,2.4033,1.8427,0.4775,4.5834,7.1983,0.5393,3.3947,6.5933,1.3708,6.1646,3.681,0.2221,5.5447,7.734,0.2498,0.4052,0.4285,0.2515,0.2033,3.1588,2.4131,0.7216,1.0519,3.3122,2.9858,3.8189,3.9079,2.2998,2.1146,0.0461,2.7145,0.2267,2.4646,4.8442,0.017,0.4577]}

And Fury was speaking about what it\u2019s like to fight such a legendary boxer in this interview with DAZN\u2019s Trevor Noah.\nTrevor Noah: So Tyson Fury, what\u2019s it like to fight Deontay Wilder, with some of the fan support outside of the ring?\nFury: You know, when I entered Deontay Wilder\u2019s corner for the first time, it was like, \u2018Who are they putting this guy with?\nDeontay Wilder, who was the best boxer in the world, was a little bit intimidating for a kid. But I know what I can hit. So when I came in the ring with this guy, I really respected every second I was in the ring with him.\nThen Deontay Wilder, he\u2019s the best fighter of this generation without any doubt, but he\u2019s a big old dude. Big old dude. A lot of people will say he looks like a superhero to me, but that\u2019s just because of the way he fights. His strength is unbelievable.\nWhen he turned the corner, he looked like the Greek Gods. When I first turned the corner, too, but I kept my strength going, my concentration and I kept going.\nTrevor Noah: It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if you were to be surprised to how the fight goes, to what turns out to happen in that particular bout.\nTrevor Noah: Was that the moment where you realized who Deontay Wilder was and I want to ask everybody because I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve wondered as well, who Deontay Wilder is?\nThe first time I fought Deontay Wilder, he didn\u2019t move very well. As he hit me, I kept getting punched. But as the rounds went on, his punches hurt more and more.\nThen, when it came down to the end, he started to move better. He was getting up. His punches hurt, man, and he used the jab, too. He was pretty fast and accurate with that jab. I knew that his left wasn\u2019t going to stop me, but he could knock me to the mat with that right. So at the end of 12 rounds, I was exhausted.","token_len":584,"entropy":[9.2057,2.814,3.8679,10.3428,0.9358,3.7544,2.1095,6.0244,1.5521,2.3193,8.3128,2.0069,0.2273,2.5484,5.1861,4.0926,7.1096,8.3137,1.8464,2.6979,3.5421,1.1145,2.4114,1.737,4.6023,5.5626,6.2946,7.8342,2.2781,0.1259,0.6249,2.0979,5.6318,2.3764,8.0789,0.2538,0.5298,4.996,5.0186,1.3038,0.9022,1.339,2.4393,3.0471,4.7502,1.6165,1.734,1.6999,1.2085,0.1243,5.5112,2.875,0.9115,2.1703,2.5443,2.9772,4.7062,1.0157,2.8314,1.3716,2.8891,5.0295,0.7895,7.2135,0.4425,6.4039,0.0731,1.4471,3.5296,0.0321,4.7603,0.1185,1.1281,5.6946,0.1771,0.442,5.0597,7.3142,0.6839,0.9317,13.5385,9.1007,9.1642,11.0281,9.691,7.2952,1.4079,1.8272,0.6749,1.554,6.1567,7.6687,3.9208,0.8484,0.6451,2.0383,3.5918,4.0135,1.4383,12.4732,5.2201,0.5236,5.054,0.0107,0.2812,7.9814,7.2764,3.2952,8.1281,4.029,4.3733,2.6266,19.389,7.751,0.8094,0.1954,0.2097,1.8996,7.0487,0.7672,6.6027,3.8064,2.2716,3.7081,8.4359,1.3955,10.8182,6.334,2.3645,2.5561,0.9822,1.233,9.5292,5.4085,0.8896,0.9533,4.1327,2.2185,0.0005,0.0117,1.6501,3.1922,5.4999,0.2841,2.0227,2.1156,3.4895,1.309,0.1204,2.0078,0.1193,0.2507,0.5346,5.6075,0.0001,0.0003,0.0095,0.0072,2.4409,5.391,5.279,1.2865,0.336,6.9248,3.1557,6.5933,0.4427,1.0153,1.9243,0.7804,0.3831,2.3884,0.0051,0.0639,4.5673,0.1864,0.2477,3.9022,1.4344,6.2518,6.9014,0.0018,0.001,1.329,0.0032,2.7615,0.0513,0.0348,4.3582,3.8741,0.6839,0.6237,0.0697,1.1871,2.5918,0.3572,2.2198,1.0446,9.01,6.7899,5.9299,2.4604,3.3501,7.1078,4.3353,1.8372,4.0415,0.9274,2.2226,5.2928,0.0021,0.0008,0.1118,0.0036,4.6204,2.2999,2.0247,3.0157,3.7009,1.5168,0.6229,0.2602,0.1383,0.9748,2.0144,2.6439,3.9962,1.1839,6.6558,2.6131,3.329,2.6192,2.0147,2.4787,1.8643,4.2135,2.4225,2.309,2.7301,8.8629,1.6091,3.9832,3.0016,1.0318,2.8349,1.5454,2.9877,0.7104,1.8654,3.8649,1.64,0.4383,0.9582,4.3544,6.1219,6.6291,2.8089,5.0873,1.9899,1.9651,1.8248,0.1319,1.0277,0.2729,0.3717,1.2691,5.5817,2.6058,0.0013,0.0007,1.1286,0.0023,3.0551,2.8891,5.4446,0.178,0.1396,2.8425,1.3271,2.4935,3.1827,3.8481,0.6223,8.1872,2.2392,3.719,1.1081,3.5133,1.5271,1.495,0.0419,0.0399,1.9066,3.8133,7.4135,3.4544,0.9338,6.8888,0.4908,2.6316,0.805,5.1,2.3593,0.1034,1.1439,4.513,1.6022,2.7747,4.149,0.7189,1.3845,6.3844,5.9335,0.5797,1.0191,0.3679,2.8583,0.89,0.0748,0.0512,2.0574,3.5182,1.9622,1.525,1.7944,0.3014,3.1445,0.3835,5.3599,5.0971,0.7624,2.712,0.4338,1.5651,4.5606,2.2438,5.7626,3.5567,0.1181,0.854,1.3791,2.7778,0.5877,2.8878,7.7104,5.5046,1.2878,3.6758,1.6649,4.2387,5.0336,0.7351,0.0062,0.2604,8.802,0.235,6.434,1.3185,3.7652,3.1909,6.7904,5.0873,1.5276,4.0671,7.7725,2.564,3.9444,1.3597,2.0683,0.6648,1.4919,2.7449,0.4071,0.002,0.0059,0.1495,4.133,7.9191,0.9692,0.744,0.2559,2.5991,0.5029,0.311,1.1605,2.4845,1.9196,3.7436,5.8107,3.49,10.4001,4.4374,2.7368,3.8768,2.9167,4.7818,2.5725,8.135,1.3449,0.2361,3.1817,2.0974,2.5845,4.5809,3.6401,0.4756,0.4172,4.6152,0.1309,0.0014,0.0023,0.006,7.9114,2.1557,1.6545,3.0908,2.3746,1.2161,1.963,4.4239,1.8859,0.0008,0.0007,0.1502,0.0022,0.8734,2.1001,4.8399,6.3585,0.1137,2.6285,7.9124,6.1171,1.6545,3.0856,0.1528,1.3093,3.7172,1.3332,2.6019,0.0655,1.4191,6.2799,5.616,0.7677,1.443,4.2222,2.6006,0.0011,0.0007,0.1133,0.0015,0.6391,1.9843,0.4076,5.2786,3.052,1.4975,0.4753,4.9122,0.6206,0.0006,0.0005,0.1769,0.0015,0.5857,1.9775,4.3591,0.1501,0.1335,0.09,5.0033,2.9011,1.3227,0.6301,5.6482,2.7638,6.4825,1.5741,0.9419,0.7502,3.1489,3.3987,4.4304,1.3624,3.0054,3.6711,3.5465,4.3085,0.333,0.1965,0.163,3.9538,2.1882,6.8074,3.105,1.1431,0.3477,0.7876,1.8782,2.7418,2.1643,1.9853,4.1927,1.6612,2.1496,0.0509,1.7721,4.0979,0.4435,1.3105,3.0705,1.4432,1.9213,3.9634,0.6519,1.6166,1.7165,2.697,4.221,2.918,3.5233,2.6576,3.0407,4.2618,7.3998,1.7417,2.531,1.3723,5.9299,3.0845,4.5739,2.4724,3.3384,0.3299,2.2475,1.3292,5.715,3.908,2.6437,4.6137,3.369,2.3189,1.4559,0.3209,2.1319,3.5613,1.6284,4.6301,5.4349,7.9782,1.4503,0.8708,0.0113,1.1138,0.049,2.7345,2.2906,1.4428,1.0605,1.7965,4.6779,5.0956,0.1517,3.5548,0.0259,2.487,3.2021,1.0678,2.3239,1.2286,2.7202,5.3068,1.4063,0.4499,0.3849,10.8354,0.5778,0.2168,0.9287,1.4542,6.1694,0.9676]}
{"prompt":"Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has lost support of senior cabinet officials after it emerged he had business links to scandal-plagued Brazilian company Odebrecht , two government sources said on Thursday , amid opposition calls","text":"Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has lost support of senior cabinet officials after it emerged he had business links to scandal-plagued Brazilian company Odebrecht, two government sources said on Thursday, amid opposition calls for his resignation.\n\"They say he is guilty, and are ready to throw him overboard,\" one of the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\nThe revelation comes as Mr Kuczynski is grappling with allegations of corruption as well as a failed business deal of his, in which a Brazilian tycoon gave him a car in exchange for his support as a Congressman. Mr Kuczynski responded to the deal by refusing to take the car. Mr Kuczynski also denied allegations of corrupt ties with a Brazilian billionaire, Luiz Inacio 'Lula' Da Silva, who is being investigated in several Brazilian corruption cases.\nThe government sources said the business deal involving Mr Da Silva, who is jailed in Brazil for corruption, is the one for which Mr Kuczynski has been forced to apologize to the public.\n\"He has no business with Mr Da Silva,\" said the government sources.\nMr Kuczynski has faced an impeachment inquiry into his ties to Mr Da Silva in Congress, which was temporarily halted after he called Mr Da Silva's incarceration a \"fair judgement\".\n\"I don't like his words, but he is correct,\" said the government sources, referring to Mr Da Silva, who he has called an \"incredible man\".\nMr Kuczynski, a former economist, was elected to a five-year term in 2016 after an impeachment inquiry. But he lost support to a far-right candidate three months into his second term.\nHe has since had more than 30 cabinet ministers resign or quit, including Mr Kuczynski's own mentor, former finance minister Mercedes Arana.\nAnother source, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to talk about politics, said that Mr Kuczynski's closest political allies decided to dump him over the Odebrecht deal.\n\"The presidential allies have decided that a new campaign is about to begin,\" he added.\nMr Kuczynski, who is facing an impeachment inquiry in Congress, and his business partners have defended themselves against the corruption allegations.\nMr Kuczynski on Monday denounced \"political persecution\", and has said he would not resign over the scandal.\nAfter receiving a government pardon a month ago, Mr Kuczynski's business partnership with Mr Odebrecht, which he has said has never done work for the Peruvian government, has prompted concerns over the possibility that he could be implicated in corruption.\nSeveral Brazilian investigators have also questioned Mr Da Silva. In October, a Supreme Court judge in Brazil ordered Mr Da Silva to appear in court on October 10 over a deal for a high-rise in a luxury shopping district in Rio de Janeiro.","token_len":584,"entropy":[11.2904,4.2832,3.5638,0.1102,0.0354,0.0132,0.0011,2.6877,7.6427,4.6083,4.6527,7.2657,6.0268,2.2626,3.3015,4.8963,0.3361,1.2082,1.4944,9.7376,3.796,1.0651,9.2939,0.1486,1.3179,0.0046,0.0002,6.018,5.0952,6.8439,0.0271,0.0068,0.0104,1.7618,6.4528,5.0503,1.3743,0.977,1.2734,1.998,3.2561,3.2458,7.2273,1.9561,0.3464,2.3824,0.2476,0.1892,0.2155,11.4566,4.9054,3.7541,1.2804,1.3482,5.757,2.4415,2.4697,5.6079,4.5749,0.0909,5.6187,1.159,4.8373,0.4885,1.6079,1.2982,0.2257,0.7134,0.4795,1.7797,3.3597,0.0205,1.4614,0.4026,1.9542,1.5129,0.1501,0.2712,5.517,5.9317,1.5637,1.0682,4.106,0.4481,0.001,0.001,2.2869,5.1509,0.0181,3.2412,1.0527,0.9013,4.6259,2.8678,0.0053,2.0076,4.9318,3.7648,1.2001,6.4222,2.497,4.2294,3.4278,0.1526,3.4902,3.4376,5.3212,0.0139,4.4948,3.7397,1.6919,7.4778,2.9655,0.7978,0.0039,3.5046,2.3622,5.0894,2.7972,12.4769,0.8429,4.0867,0.0744,0.0008,0.0007,6.3842,1.2361,0.8498,7.786,1.2705,4.9718,0.0923,3.6652,2.1618,2.3655,2.2556,4.802,0.2095,0.0013,0.0009,3.0159,2.1012,3.5006,1.2878,5.0412,4.0235,2.6353,2.9248,2.3374,5.5049,1.68,4.9795,0.4057,0.2358,0.3708,13.3608,2.7244,2.2022,0.0815,8.1318,0.0059,0.5926,0.8943,1.8809,4.114,0.3104,3.2248,6.3078,3.3556,2.9046,0.7668,0.411,0.2947,1.6156,3.6371,1.5098,0.4996,1.9446,5.5249,0.6795,4.3587,1.5132,2.2103,0.0009,1.9337,1.1476,1.4441,6.5097,0.9802,1.1627,0.8124,1.6957,0.7312,2.7227,2.6639,5.2077,4.8424,0.0329,0.6967,0.0406,0.0006,0.0004,1.3032,1.355,3.492,0.0983,5.3113,2.5929,1.2088,1.9881,0.4509,0.7683,2.0472,1.9926,1.6676,3.1833,0.6747,2.1446,3.7304,1.4304,0.0007,1.6159,2.0316,1.4428,2.6711,1.8051,0.6892,0.7454,2.0029,0.2316,0.0014,0.0009,1.7061,4.297,4.3028,5.226,2.6557,2.4769,1.7029,3.5649,0.2184,2.373,0.3054,0.0004,3.1362,6.7252,1.3256,1.648,2.6389,7.1936,2.8321,1.4652,1.9049,5.2451,3.3069,1.0687,0.0001,2.1259,11.3461,0.6924,0.3232,8.5804,6.77,0.6011,0.6664,2.3356,2.506,3.1462,0.0007,3.9512,3.611,3.7789,1.3175,0.9152,1.7021,1.5346,5.9997,1.5253,1.0002,1.2786,1.0177,1.2078,1.3147,3.0788,0.0159,1.1218,2.588,0.0004,1.8554,0.5383,5.1943,2.4464,2.706,2.8118,0.2183,4.5956,2.2328,2.7123,0.5643,0.4151,1.9714,0.3181,0.0012,0.0008,2.4207,2.3052,1.1042,6.4354,0.9798,2.0555,2.4986,1.4586,2.4459,3.4365,0.032,0.0435,0.0608,0.5342,6.2751,1.8749,3.8244,3.2954,2.2427,2.7927,4.6128,1.3681,4.0165,3.4137,4.4812,2.6533,5.8674,0.8277,0.1716,2.0789,8.2067,1.0954,4.0773,0.42,3.3983,0.0145,1.3763,0.5899,1.9661,1.3751,3.4727,5.3901,5.1549,0.4882,2.9971,4.7341,1.803,2.3394,3.6385,5.0813,1.6142,1.8438,4.5893,1.3298,0.0031,0.0013,0.5287,2.83,6.978,0.6362,1.899,2.8468,0.0151,11.2046,5.118,5.9357,1.7758,0.6938,6.491,2.882,2.7687,0.9275,1.8989,0.36,0.0033,0.0188,0.289,1.5719,1.4143,0.4891,0.3209,0.6446,0.0286,3.1271,1.488,3.3961,0.1153,0.1621,2.3613,0.7509,0.124,0.0015,0.0005,1.4743,6.9372,3.3607,1.3044,8.0378,0.4666,6.6458,0.6056,3.6211,0.8668,8.8686,0.0026,0.0029,0.0006,0.6473,1.4509,0.5112,0.9426,2.1882,7.6098,7.5245,2.6785,2.1376,1.9913,4.5311,3.5997,5.4424,1.3163,4.9076,0.3634,1.341,1.1931,2.0001,3.2671,0.1057,0.4662,2.1023,0.2284,0.0017,0.0007,2.4963,0.8642,1.6193,3.748,2.988,0.9424,1.229,2.5846,1.2935,0.4353,5.4371,1.1344,3.8396,1.6763,1.2393,6.0189,3.1012,1.5344,2.0106,5.6348,0.5129,0.5776,0.5789,2.9154,0.6766,0.0023,0.0008,6.1416,3.0378,5.6808,3.2703,4.4254,5.1877,2.162,2.5181,4.9091,2.0175,0.782,1.5261,1.7991,2.5416,3.0512,0.6824,1.3714,0.394,0.6464,5.7729,4.5782,1.3477,5.4609,3.7525,6.4415,1.8225,0.0958,0.2043,0.6658,0.2399,0.0016,0.0007,2.6272,3.4396,5.1421,0.3769,3.7325,1.8338,0.0034,0.0026,0.0003,2.7014,0.6159,1.9728,2.1664,2.3328,3.3834,5.0257,5.7196,7.1193,0.3029,2.2221,9.8895,0.0056,0.2668,0.1454,1.5129,7.2921,4.7155,2.5668,1.6668,5.5858,1.1368,1.6143,1.1664,0.8912,3.0806,0.2127,1.4673,0.7805,0.5015,6.6526,3.6773,6.0653,0.7983,2.5313,1.9783,0.751,4.5867,0.0004,2.6237,3.2547,3.2677,0.507,2.1757,7.3423,0.015,0.7913,1.9288,2.0113,2.7882,1.2844,1.4817,0.0001,0.7709,3.4304,0.6719,0.3962,1.9901,3.8866,3.4261,4.5852,2.3315,5.046,2.5237,2.0041,5.3114,0.2677,3.7406,2.5303,3.1853,4.9724,4.2933,1.5659,1.3755,3.0096,0.2768,0.0008,0.6862]}
{"prompt":"Iranian state television broadcast on Sunday what it described as the confessions of an Iranian academic with Swedish residency who it said had provided information to Israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists","text":"Iranian state television broadcast on Sunday what it described as the confessions of an Iranian academic with Swedish residency who it said had provided information to Israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists.\n\u201cThe accused in the court of Tehran today, according to law, has confessed to the crimes he committed against Iran\u2019s national defense system,\u201d state TV cited a statement read out by the court.\nThe statement said Ghayat Mahmoudi, 41, a Stockholm-based writer and researcher, had admitted that by 2012 he had helped a secret Israeli unit to carry out military operations against Tehran.\nMahmoudi said he had provided details of Iran\u2019s defense program, including details of Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons, to Israel in 2012, without any financial compensation, according to the interview published by Swedish daily Dagbladet.\nThe Iranian court quoted a witness as saying that Mahmoudi had provided \u201cdetailed information\u201d about Iran\u2019s defense program and its nuclear development to a Swedish intelligence unit that works for the Israel military intelligence.\nAccording to one of the witnesses, Mahmoudi had provided a list of several Iranian scientists that contained \u201csome important contacts\u201d, including the identities of the most senior nuclear scientists.\nMahmoudi, who received a PhD in political science at the University of Stockholm, taught in the social department at Tehran University. He was jailed in 2013 on charges of espionage for allegedly helping Swedish intelligence.\nThe Iranian state, while officially denying any involvement in its alleged assassination of several nuclear scientists, also admitted that four of the attackers were Iranian. In 2015 two Israelis were sentenced to prison for the attack.\nThe assassination attempts in a heavily guarded facility at the Teheran research center, which houses the most secretive nuclear center in Iran, spurred fears that the Iranians could succeed in developing enough nuclear weapons to cause major destabilization both domestically and regionally.\nThe Islamic Republic, the world\u2019s second-most powerful country by world population estimate, has made it clear that it would not take any steps that violate international law to develop nuclear weapons.\nIn May, Iran told the United Nations atomic watchdog it was pursuing the enrichment of uranium to levels for military use and that it would not halt its \u201cscientific and technological activities\u201d in exchange for diplomatic concessions.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency has warned that Tehran was running far ahead of schedule in its nuclear program, saying that after Iran had completed the first stage of its program in 2005, it could have started developing the second one in as much as six months. Instead, it is currently in the ninth year of that stage.\nThe United States administration of President Barack Obama has said it will soon announce additional sanctions against Iran in the wake of the latest revelations that it was behind the attack, and is preparing to deploy a US aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf.","token_len":585,"entropy":[6.9161,4.8035,2.6423,3.9849,3.3985,1.8518,5.8294,1.0013,2.232,0.0177,2.202,9.0355,0.1564,3.8294,2.1536,7.5907,4.5362,10.4368,3.0648,1.7445,7.5743,0.3951,1.3325,4.4749,2.2511,1.0608,5.366,3.1902,1.9289,2.3455,5.7479,6.5139,3.9583,7.7773,0.3704,0.6103,0.2664,17.6708,7.385,3.8548,6.2326,5.8629,0.3654,6.4431,4.2364,7.4387,7.775,2.3617,5.6092,0.0028,7.4073,2.1031,2.1011,2.5909,0.303,2.1048,3.1322,3.4457,1.337,2.5961,4.8015,7.0223,6.9419,6.851,2.8842,6.1118,4.1162,1.3401,7.2349,7.0554,6.4817,1.7496,5.3699,2.0805,1.9478,6.0542,2.2163,0.2446,0.9589,2.626,1.4093,0.5935,2.1773,2.5468,1.3284,8.0244,4.5894,4.5982,6.099,3.1071,0.8828,5.9464,0.0199,2.7155,7.8498,0.6573,0.0773,5.7759,1.1364,2.3766,0.7871,0.7412,4.5214,2.3286,6.8085,6.2064,0.6467,0.1556,3.9003,3.5415,5.9259,1.9182,3.5688,1.403,3.5859,0.0011,5.8211,0.8113,0.9337,3.8422,0.9748,0.4682,5.1876,0.095,0.0024,0.0213,2.9018,0.9538,0.5921,2.9595,3.9212,1.0004,3.6638,11.6252,0.554,0.0046,6.0869,4.074,2.4867,1.5942,2.5908,0.8486,4.1757,2.5638,0.0027,0.0336,1.1487,2.27,2.6644,0.6696,1.1889,1.9472,2.3761,1.4824,5.4435,3.37,6.2425,3.1122,1.6184,1.5827,0.0029,0.5743,7.1129,3.141,0.9585,3.0247,2.4236,0.9373,4.2316,0.006,0.0004,0.3817,0.2005,2.1241,4.3176,2.8916,5.2536,1.9318,4.1254,0.7636,0.0799,0.5388,2.6756,0.0033,0.7257,1.9179,13.2843,0.4578,7.4436,0.0343,0.8279,2.0672,4.8468,1.5485,0.9345,0.2392,0.0019,0.0052,4.3223,0.4389,2.4948,3.0735,3.8754,4.7866,3.4185,4.0293,3.5066,3.2974,2.1591,2.6896,7.3472,1.5932,0.8585,4.1128,5.1308,1.968,3.4256,0.231,4.4104,0.004,6.7823,0.5579,0.1674,1.9476,0.432,1.6896,0.0033,1.157,2.1283,3.2429,2.0873,0.0658,5.5665,2.386,1.6368,3.2445,5.8287,6.9274,0.0993,4.2419,5.6903,8.5189,2.9574,0.8802,4.5429,1.7046,2.3585,5.979,0.0986,1.8497,5.0598,1.3561,0.8549,0.2459,1.9611,0.2962,2.1482,0.0039,0.003,0.001,2.557,0.694,5.7852,1.4177,4.2532,0.8583,3.4082,0.0282,1.8922,0.6653,0.5526,0.0073,2.5781,0.991,7.8882,2.7713,1.342,7.0093,9.1754,1.286,5.5916,0.5662,2.2303,1.272,1.3883,5.6904,0.8019,2.6847,1.9532,0.5867,0.247,2.101,1.9607,1.618,2.1895,6.28,1.3044,4.8548,0.3655,2.1952,3.4314,2.6073,6.2799,5.9203,6.8906,2.2753,1.802,0.852,0.3437,4.8943,4.2978,4.8729,1.324,3.9743,2.729,0.0493,0.1775,4.1369,4.7409,1.2284,7.3444,1.3901,0.8541,6.4155,1.3059,2.0514,1.9049,4.603,5.2163,6.528,5.8961,0.7981,2.9311,0.1566,2.4483,1.2481,3.5693,4.1225,1.0771,0.41,1.9948,6.7164,5.6044,2.937,4.9814,8.2181,2.1155,3.0872,1.9618,0.6476,6.2365,0.0583,0.0068,5.3459,1.8902,2.5582,1.7408,5.0836,1.4119,3.8339,7.0198,1.0195,6.3262,0.1926,4.6042,0.1303,8.6005,4.1386,0.8579,1.4921,4.6184,1.7444,5.6534,0.1365,3.4587,6.5947,1.3486,0.4221,0.3425,3.6741,3.7984,5.4595,0.1656,8.8267,3.0298,0.0223,8.0387,0.0541,0.1717,0.4115,1.878,5.4894,0.2809,2.8663,3.5094,1.176,9.1335,0.9302,0.6243,2.5224,0.4809,3.5087,0.9296,1.8859,4.6493,4.273,2.6138,13.801,0.1452,1.1066,4.9475,2.7707,0.8667,0.4366,0.5609,2.2616,1.2955,4.2685,1.5939,1.4702,3.4534,5.3548,1.4564,0.281,1.9941,3.1556,0.4098,0.1285,0.6682,0.7704,3.0829,3.8512,0.6521,1.6462,5.6482,0.8208,1.2965,0.1017,7.543,0.5478,2.6791,1.4712,4.8975,3.2983,6.8134,0.133,0.2911,2.1166,7.0105,6.4468,4.1757,1.2637,2.947,1.4836,1.0033,1.1913,1.6178,4.6106,1.0881,15.1089,0.3641,7.4869,2.2556,1.1441,2.381,2.948,1.3697,3.1201,2.3608,0.003,5.0841,1.4438,0.4476,0.5809,1.8574,4.2323,0.0062,0.0001,0.0001,2.6262,2.6553,0.4098,1.699,4.9435,6.9214,7.9946,1.6804,0.0912,2.2673,1.1637,1.576,1.6991,0.7122,1.5039,3.4026,1.4629,5.8806,3.8816,4.4524,3.0271,1.9602,2.2383,2.086,0.1624,1.0494,3.1978,1.73,4.6051,0.2864,0.5667,2.055,3.603,4.5744,4.1731,3.1375,3.1652,3.5823,1.2479,6.6999,3.8342,0.3271,2.8672,2.0367,0.3181,9.1539,0.2026,1.539,2.9566,3.8083,3.9155,0.7288,6.8243,4.0973,0.2821,5.8356,4.8165,0.844,0.5893,1.8413,3.1361,0.1979,8.3322,3.9207,0.6408,0.6438,0.0032,1.5736,1.8797,1.4752,2.1195,6.0294,3.4266,4.9567,0.7764,0.5822,0.4695,3.3366,3.0436,2.1295,0.0014,0.7553,2.7802,4.2581,2.7323,1.3351,2.215,2.461,0.7203,3.6344,2.6338,2.1952,3.751,3.8693,0.6552,4.8866,2.1999,5.3246,4.0206,0.0341,1.1068,0.8007,0.6349,0.002,1.4398]}

On the basis of these, the US Senate will probably move forward to discuss the issue of US funding for overseas Chinese.\nThe global newspaper warned China, however, that it should work out a strategy for how to get more favourable terms to safeguard its interests because the US is not ready to reduce tariffs further.\nTOKYO -- Japan's biggest newspaper said Monday that the US-China trade war threatens to bring global growth to a halt.\nThis article was translated by LNTA on behalf of Global Times into English, and is not edited in any way by Global Times.\nThe newspaper - called The Asahi Shimbun, which is based in central Tokyo - said that while several Asian economies had been able to post strong figures in recent months amid soft demand globally, those results could be undermined by the US-China trade war.\nThe conflict has already disrupted supply chains, costing many companies money, and has raised fears about slump in the global economy.\nThe newspaper said it has consulted foreign-exchange experts and noted that countries around the world could face a loss of trade revenue stemming from lower demand, in exchange for less pressure on their national currencies.\nThe newspaper said the international community has begun to respond to the trade conflict by expressing concern that this may worsen the global economic outlook.\nHowever, it also warned about the risks of a major trade war - which it said might bring the global economic growth back to zero or a negative growth rate - and said that even with a major easing of trade barriers, it could cause global unemployment to increase.\n(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration last week called off the suspension of the partial US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, and this could signal a temporary relaxation of trade tensions that are threatening to drag down economic growth worldwide.\nPresident Trump also pledged in his election victory speech that he would bring more jobs \"back to America.\"\nThe Trump administration has called off the suspension of the partial trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, saying it will resume negotiations with the countries.\nWhile the US imposed tariffs, Mexico's president called the Trump decision \"immoral and illegal.\"\nHowever, the US Treasury Department did not disclose if it had already resumed talks with both countries.","token_len":585,"entropy":[5.1083,5.9012,3.2133,2.5433,4.7862,0.661,5.801,7.0389,7.8212,0.5955,4.9241,0.0885,0.5715,0.8131,5.0209,1.8135,5.3879,1.3038,4.0087,0.0017,1.5636,3.9561,3.4841,0.0066,0.5986,3.4497,1.7703,3.1951,10.6061,0.0689,4.7034,4.6621,1.7198,5.2827,1.3692,0.0366,2.6801,5.3814,6.9832,1.187,7.1151,1.3137,0.7844,5.5098,3.3548,3.7403,4.6607,6.6503,4.5617,3.6683,5.3747,4.1005,3.0439,0.1959,0.2431,16.6765,4.6118,1.4368,3.8337,1.2882,5.2739,7.316,7.6454,4.6737,5.4346,0.0018,3.9718,3.6178,6.7737,1.4423,2.5522,2.2224,1.7426,5.6658,5.8358,4.8567,0.1983,0.0271,2.2422,1.374,0.0159,0.4273,1.2894,11.0758,8.1371,4.7102,2.2149,3.3314,5.4944,2.1333,5.6344,3.5608,0.0027,4.5208,1.9686,6.7079,3.2255,5.4546,1.4316,4.863,6.8258,0.7299,6.6414,6.0955,1.9764,3.5379,2.7626,0.5996,4.4914,1.0159,4.2435,0.9107,1.186,4.3659,0.0918,5.3492,2.6258,2.8946,5.7977,4.8989,6.0622,7.9972,7.0286,4.7127,4.4918,0.3173,3.219,1.8887,1.3903,2.9051,5.8237,2.378,4.3309,3.5526,6.1596,1.6561,4.5991,0.1424,3.2517,3.4312,1.3763,3.5406,5.3649,3.2722,5.2243,4.9583,1.9202,4.2837,5.6738,0.9684,1.6203,2.1574,3.3104,6.792,0.509,7.1258,7.2251,6.7217,0.7258,2.0016,5.9916,3.3418,6.1186,5.0509,3.3249,6.6099,0.0409,0.583,1.6466,3.188,5.0706,3.7559,1.2551,5.495,1.399,3.4545,0.2977,4.7136,3.4065,5.4122,2.3758,2.1401,8.3484,1.2645,1.1719,7.0788,2.5127,1.1748,2.1338,2.4048,4.5251,0.2884,6.9284,2.9602,7.9,0.6412,0.4404,10.6431,0.8901,0.004,4.8896,1.6321,1.2861,5.332,2.409,2.1035,2.1075,0.6839,2.232,1.4174,3.5862,2.2022,0.7589,4.1123,5.8398,0.763,4.8566,4.9627,4.8486,0.665,1.0028,1.115,1.4226,0.1794,9.1911,1.666,0.0794,0.0885,0.0914,0.0938,0.0123,0.0052,0.0352,0.0001,0.0005,0.0011,0.0028,0.0745,0.0005,0.0119,0.0071,0.0093,0.0012,0.0083,0.0018,0.0004,0.0014,0.0009,0.0007,0.0032,0.0055,0.3306,1.3385,3.485,7.7436,5.5108,2.9385,6.8833,0.1065,0.232,0.0001,0.0001,3.0581,2.6319,1.7692,1.5682,0.0845,7.1783,0.6634,0.2965,1.1811,1.3644,3.8657,6.9529,4.6691,3.1367,3.0924,2.5947,4.1367,0.0073,7.6881,1.6233,6.6924,1.0276,1.9304,1.9101,6.7319,7.0763,5.7134,7.6443,0.2297,5.1769,5.6006,3.4464,1.3619,3.0358,0.6364,1.3874,2.1284,1.0863,0.6899,0.2582,0.2001,0.3069,0.1298,1.7979,8.202,1.6669,3.5355,5.1905,5.2578,0.6465,1.8799,6.1574,4.8921,3.0761,4.4297,1.6524,1.4326,1.84,4.103,1.7604,2.274,11.1195,0.3212,1.9058,1.7751,0.9267,0.4574,0.4964,1.5311,2.3994,0.7136,2.201,3.7199,6.3548,5.9583,4.3341,3.3386,0.0374,1.4291,1.5273,5.1332,0.2636,6.0131,4.8358,0.0246,0.0793,3.4982,2.8464,2.2917,4.6993,0.1095,3.9557,2.8519,6.8893,0.0028,5.9518,3.6951,2.5953,4.7916,4.7523,0.0041,4.5579,5.4523,0.5693,2.319,4.4893,2.2522,0.3706,0.1747,1.7341,2.1175,0.8857,2.0615,5.3102,1.9185,2.5064,5.751,0.4201,4.4115,0.4214,0.8307,3.6065,3.3137,0.9773,7.0677,1.5435,2.2731,5.5807,3.3675,3.8019,1.2216,3.4226,1.8042,4.1368,0.8009,0.2429,4.6122,0.033,1.0288,2.336,2.1527,6.2734,0.8622,2.9701,0.9325,2.1421,4.9586,2.0971,0.359,5.2271,2.3049,2.3729,0.6719,4.1872,3.9091,2.6744,2.2374,3.3144,4.0997,4.0004,0.3323,5.9875,3.47,4.9931,4.0363,4.3934,1.1652,3.5449,2.0059,1.9449,1.4395,4.7718,3.4672,1.932,3.7042,9.2169,0.2117,1.3267,2.3476,0.3958,1.9652,2.5184,3.7322,4.3567,4.8956,1.2158,2.4074,0.7666,0.1586,5.0118,7.3484,0.5102,4.5351,2.0844,8.5542,0.0709,6.4926,0.3091,4.1312,4.1852,1.8332,5.0604,0.0345,1.0919,8.4896,2.1178,0.461,4.2689,5.2086,2.2522,0.787,1.7547,1.043,3.0338,6.2942,5.1695,4.4932,1.0734,6.4633,5.5656,0.5341,2.1683,4.1891,2.919,2.926,4.1517,0.554,4.1851,2.3325,3.2286,0.2583,5.9875,0.2632,0.3011,3.7759,0.9267,4.6302,5.6586,3.6941,1.2825,5.1335,2.9499,0.4538,1.3708,0.7341,0.2448,4.2516,4.9716,2.2831,8.3989,1.9117,0.1935,0.3912,1.2626,0.7989,1.5807,2.645,0.0779,3.106,3.304,1.1837,0.2913,0.6332,0.0918,0.0905,0.3256,2.664,0.5156,3.4211,0.1457,1.4006,0.7838,0.6031,2.5047,1.142,2.3002,6.3269,2.0351,1.3852,1.1212,3.0477,2.6656,0.5223,4.8614,1.128,1.3901,6.1325,1.8624,4.7308,3.9593,3.6025,4.3198,5.7316,1.2847,5.3301,4.8408,0.9596,6.5213,0.2669,2.2,3.0342,0.7106,0.2936,4.6194,0.0233,1.4344,1.6391,4.7103,0.1344,4.3391,0.1925,4.991,4.806,1.2424,1.5089,3.6126,5.1423,2.4252,0.3186,4.2605,0.373,0.8329]}

IPL would play for 19 odd matches in the first half of next year. The players would opt for quarantine for 11 days before the tournament gets underway. The teams are not able to bring their entire squad in May even though only six days have been left for the completion of the lock down period in India.\nThe BCCI is not in a rush to complete the IPL this year, as well as it\u2019s not trying to complete the season by March. The IPL will restart with five teams in each group, rather than six teams as previously planned. The teams will be quarantined for at least 2 weeks after which the players will undergo Covid-19 test. If no result comes out then only the player will be eligible to start playing.

{"prompt":"British Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to the Middle East this week to lend her support to economic reforms in Saudi Arabia and Jordan , her spokesman said . Her trip comes as Britain","text":"British Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to the Middle East this week to lend her support to economic reforms in Saudi Arabia and Jordan, her spokesman said. Her trip comes as Britain is pushing for other Western powers to join in a US-led campaign against illegal energy trading by rogue states. In a statement, Mr May said her first stop on Tuesday would be in Riyadh, where she would have discussions with Saudi king Salman bin Abdul Aziz for \" the continuation of a dialogue on a range of issues including economic and security, and our joint interest in preventing corruption and money laundering in our world \". She told Radio 4 earlier in the day that any sanctions that are imposed on Saudi Arabia will \" have real and immediate effects \" as the kingdom is \" a major and important economic partner for the UK \". Her travel to Jordan coincides with plans by the U.S. administration to impose financial sanctions on some Iranian banks, and to ban imports from a number of Iranian firms including Iran's National Iranian Tanker Company. U.S. officials said that they would ban Iran from buying oil from the U.S. through one of the Gulf's largest oil companies, but did not say who or which vessel was involved. Saudi Arabia had threatened Saudi firms to withdraw from the deal if the sanctions were put into place, but its biggest oil trader, Saudi Arabian Oil Company, made no immediate announcement. On Friday Mr. May met the Prime Minister of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Ahmad Al Sabah, who said that the kingdom will work to \" preserve its oil-based economy \". Mr. May is expected to fly to the United Arab Emirates after her visit to Saudi Arabia. She will hold talks with President of the UAE, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The visit comes as Saudi Arabia's oil production is slated to increase by 5 million bpd in the coming months. The UAE is preparing to export 300,000 bpd in April. In London, British Petroleum said on Friday that the kingdom had approved a construction program in the capital in an effort to further boost capacity. \" We think we are ahead of schedule. A lot of work and discussions took place but we were ahead of that deadline, \" BP UK chief executive Patrick Hayes told Reuters. British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said the plan would boost capacity to \" 100 million bpd \" by 2040. He did not say how much the new refinery would cost, but said it would require investment of $25 billion in five years to build and operate, and that in the initial stage the kingdom would look to a mix of domestic, European, and Chinese financing. Mr. Hunt said that despite the sanctions, he wanted to encourage more economic and trade ties with Saudi Arabia, adding that he supported the idea of using the kingdom as a \" regional hub for trade and economic opportunities \" for Britain. Saudi Arabia's national carrier will launch flights from London to Jeddah Friday.","token_len":585,"entropy":[8.686,0.0211,2.7835,0.002,3.8451,4.0548,0.1387,2.1954,2.7849,0.0482,2.5053,0.7108,0.6026,8.4787,1.0885,0.2738,0.6773,8.4849,2.2019,2.1185,3.3215,0.0009,1.7922,3.9785,1.0561,4.0652,2.2876,0.144,0.4648,7.0066,1.6995,1.5562,1.2805,3.4465,2.5986,4.3424,0.7177,6.8742,3.5242,2.2486,0.0849,2.3603,2.413,2.3588,5.5619,0.6626,0.0722,2.3086,1.2637,6.3062,8.1394,3.6472,4.2329,4.45,2.8843,0.5743,4.7287,1.3795,2.5555,0.49,3.1971,1.2248,0.4261,3.3183,6.2179,3.1576,2.7942,5.1665,1.4428,0.0271,2.3642,3.3155,0.9609,0.6938,0.4475,1.8687,4.945,4.6393,0.2366,1.5158,5.4447,0.154,1.1643,0.0395,5.9421,0.0,6.2026,2.5142,10.3849,6.2952,0.0603,3.1888,2.5944,1.7048,3.9185,2.5093,0.0006,0.4546,2.2384,3.6523,1.5725,1.5225,3.7811,2.3655,5.763,3.8378,5.6657,0.4297,4.7931,5.0424,0.8335,6.7731,0.0349,1.8909,2.5396,4.0751,6.1425,2.8703,4.6786,7.6776,0.3956,11.6256,1.8289,0.0477,1.2024,0.5149,5.4879,5.1726,3.3291,2.9701,0.5002,1.0721,1.0478,0.0271,1.8708,2.9665,5.0712,6.1072,2.0342,2.9576,2.6279,4.8568,4.5234,1.7919,1.7044,2.9482,1.8343,4.3003,2.4219,5.1098,1.7426,3.4769,2.0675,2.2734,0.4702,1.8606,1.5933,4.4566,5.1694,2.8661,1.8722,5.4951,0.0171,4.1419,0.8741,0.8936,5.188,0.0032,0.3654,0.1451,3.2046,0.3279,3.562,4.6394,0.2998,0.5164,3.9336,4.4835,1.6235,1.7882,2.691,2.8531,3.6188,3.0788,1.4939,5.2901,0.7695,0.0038,3.971,3.5158,4.4029,2.6854,0.8012,5.1635,1.4114,13.7399,2.1861,2.224,0.9894,5.6133,0.0048,0.0355,0.0436,1.1856,1.9417,2.7024,3.1988,2.4101,6.5426,2.8292,1.2458,3.1012,3.0662,1.0448,1.6732,3.5672,0.0006,0.0123,0.3049,3.3624,6.0974,0.1569,1.0011,3.9913,2.0406,1.608,1.9799,2.5221,0.9536,3.8485,3.2741,0.0065,1.6457,2.9759,4.141,5.4224,10.3959,2.4814,1.7675,0.3607,3.357,0.2891,4.3532,5.0993,6.5546,6.3895,3.4089,3.7282,1.1698,1.2825,2.6067,1.6971,1.7559,2.4321,0.4611,5.5465,1.1323,1.2148,1.6012,1.4982,4.8605,4.99,1.7971,5.0016,0.5608,2.6265,3.8286,1.784,2.6011,0.7954,5.9284,1.4557,3.7385,4.1436,0.8984,4.3088,2.5075,3.9443,6.7787,0.8157,2.9711,3.5109,4.7906,0.0019,1.8672,3.7013,1.0077,1.2678,2.3758,0.0622,7.7785,0.8642,4.1641,0.0133,0.5119,1.9072,2.8121,1.931,1.5217,3.7279,3.1491,3.4177,1.8333,2.3607,7.0458,2.5331,5.2594,4.0389,3.7886,0.2422,4.0856,2.7241,0.2501,1.7192,3.1084,1.9748,0.0196,5.3905,0.263,1.8401,3.7878,0.4861,0.0011,5.0849,2.3704,1.0381,1.3043,1.7268,0.0039,1.3621,2.3726,0.8005,3.1573,0.8787,0.1313,3.2271,3.6402,0.9714,2.8897,1.5242,6.7936,0.0242,0.3027,1.5077,0.0031,0.4676,0.1385,0.0001,2.3235,1.9289,2.9784,1.3238,1.0955,2.7898,0.1677,2.4164,2.7959,2.6336,1.9673,7.3544,0.1323,3.3157,0.8842,3.7992,1.907,3.8406,0.1342,1.6898,1.0436,1.9612,1.4972,1.1782,1.8583,4.1387,1.783,5.8792,0.5868,3.1604,6.3079,0.7155,0.0012,0.7798,0.0037,4.1866,4.5047,2.3008,3.3368,5.9757,0.42,3.5875,3.574,2.6377,1.8092,1.1449,0.6261,2.6087,4.032,2.469,4.698,1.3671,8.1171,5.7262,3.1736,1.52,4.4739,3.8169,3.6284,0.6932,0.0114,4.9803,1.7553,5.5764,1.181,2.7703,5.5954,5.4181,2.0609,1.7181,6.6103,0.2107,0.3931,2.9146,5.0874,1.8898,0.3482,2.5892,4.505,6.4644,4.7873,0.0015,4.8397,0.7962,3.6274,5.7257,0.1433,7.2499,4.6569,3.1861,6.1721,3.7055,4.0265,1.8359,0.0565,5.0285,7.5259,1.9117,1.9966,0.9125,4.2909,5.8007,2.384,7.3911,2.0923,0.7689,1.9752,5.3746,2.2722,3.5524,3.508,2.7201,3.355,5.6343,2.2383,0.2287,0.0049,1.6094,2.0751,4.3484,3.4427,0.8058,3.7948,3.8712,0.0257,1.7348,1.3368,0.7003,1.705,2.8359,4.5905,0.4315,0.8047,1.3502,0.5408,0.9913,1.3999,0.4752,5.4457,4.0844,0.6394,2.753,4.1919,0.3725,2.5128,5.5911,0.0996,2.1315,1.9057,1.7781,3.5227,3.1645,1.6203,2.055,5.2302,1.2546,6.591,2.5647,2.3335,5.7365,0.4741,5.4989,0.8401,5.1682,5.007,0.0349,4.2127,3.1609,3.9765,1.6173,1.2693,4.7792,5.2384,0.9004,2.8303,1.7981,0.1961,0.6991,1.8976,4.98,0.8937,6.7703,0.7359,3.0103,4.7053,0.5816,3.8716,3.578,5.5712,4.2702,2.2908,2.9258,0.8511,1.943,0.0026,1.6836,3.536,0.263,2.271,4.7529,1.1078,3.1675,0.3665,5.0297,1.4105,3.1273,1.457,0.3236,1.5712,5.2507,2.1225,1.626,1.8344,0.613,3.6358,5.6831,2.181,2.1992,2.772,0.766,4.2672,0.2596,1.9715,5.8843,4.2893,5.372,5.6118,3.5108,1.7691,1.9278,0.5116,6.178,0.0035,0.0016,7.5472,1.7913]}
{"prompt":"The tax bill is President Donald Trump \u2019 s biggest legislative victory this year , but Democratic strategists are already planning how to turn it into his biggest liability . The emotional trigger they think","text":"The tax bill is President Donald Trump \u2019 s biggest legislative victory this year, but Democratic strategists are already planning how to turn it into his biggest liability. The emotional trigger they think will help them move the impeachment case forward is House intelligence committee hearing Monday that will put in the spotlight President Trump's ties to Russia, which are now being investigated at the White House. A few weeks ago, I saw a lot of people trying very hard to convince people that impeachment is not the answer. That it would be the worse choice possible. It just wouldn\u2019t happen. And it would certainly make for the worst first 100 days of President Trump\u2019s administration. The impeachment inquiry is part of that plan, I think. It is there. Congress is investigating and trying to find something. They have done a lot of that over the years. They have never gotten to it. Some Democrats on the committee have asked that Mr. Trump not be allowed to testify during the commission\u2019s session on Tuesday. And several have asked that he be barred from testifying on the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The president has threatened that, too. He has promised to turn over certain documents and have his witnesses go to jail. That is why he said that there\u2019s nothing to be gained by going to impeachment and why he wants to call in people to testify to Congress and get to certain material.\nHow many of his campaign staffers have committed political crimes? Was it really possible that a president could pull off a presidential campaign so outrageously inept, that his people couldn\u2019t produce any public statements in any language, and still win the election for him? How many of the candidates running, or his campaign staff, even have any kind of a grasp of the very basic elements of any of the basic disciplines of the business world? In this case, the business world in election campaigns, in the public interest, in American democracy, in public service. And how many of them are really aware that most politicians are there to get elected, and once they\u2019re elected, they\u2019re there for the money rather than serving the public interest? So we have an interesting situation here in which we have an incredibly wealthy man, we have an incredibly capable business man, who in the middle of this campaign season, after a year, has made some very important decisions, a year of this, about what he was trying to do, he\u2019s chosen a series of very intelligent, respected colleagues whom he trusts to do those decisions for him. And to me, that brings to mind what Ronald Reagan used to say. It\u2019s a very, very, very, very dangerous combination. But this is how Republicans have been able to win. It\u2019s like I said, the American political system has become less of a democracy, and more of a dictatorship.","token_len":586,"entropy":[8.361,3.4635,2.2377,9.3746,2.0073,0.0062,15.5542,8.1444,7.6522,7.9322,3.498,3.144,4.7309,1.155,2.2082,2.6979,7.0904,5.2025,0.0014,2.1117,3.1639,5.2569,5.3252,0.335,5.0681,1.2831,1.1806,4.4745,2.5061,5.9476,0.5684,2.6739,9.8812,8.8674,6.6689,5.9266,1.4287,4.81,2.7337,4.5273,1.4988,8.7851,3.3011,1.7276,0.8677,5.7577,6.6149,0.5845,6.575,4.725,3.782,1.4535,5.4151,5.4286,3.1445,4.852,5.1477,0.5501,0.1709,3.7513,0.0586,0.1318,1.7171,2.696,3.1251,3.2696,2.2762,1.2748,5.9733,0.9566,5.2679,0.0008,0.764,4.6934,4.4583,1.7516,0.3346,0.3127,4.8748,5.5114,1.4785,3.8742,0.0316,2.6608,4.6479,7.3482,0.023,0.1072,3.7021,3.1812,0.5436,3.561,1.4133,2.1386,2.437,2.4727,1.0564,3.2604,3.698,3.5433,1.0746,2.0875,7.9363,4.195,8.8225,0.8687,2.7637,4.4834,4.2536,6.9849,3.285,0.5139,1.7828,0.3336,2.7965,2.2938,1.9193,5.0206,3.3334,4.9067,4.102,1.8601,6.8319,5.8568,0.0279,1.1227,5.0393,0.3487,1.1261,0.1304,0.9634,3.6438,0.5164,3.1302,3.9827,6.9208,1.2029,5.198,0.0391,1.8989,4.2954,1.926,4.5367,0.525,0.5064,1.9603,2.0944,6.5772,1.8978,6.7583,1.5449,5.7601,3.5553,4.4237,0.0904,2.17,6.0307,1.556,3.555,2.0576,3.7236,1.7309,1.1643,0.1377,3.18,3.369,0.0641,2.0067,0.6768,1.9571,0.7984,5.9318,4.341,1.7891,4.43,0.7988,5.6003,4.4925,4.9799,0.3809,1.3113,1.7119,3.5301,3.8873,6.8064,0.0158,0.5079,2.6582,0.7271,3.3797,0.142,1.4365,4.2692,0.5239,5.5793,3.1226,0.1703,0.1515,6.6621,3.0543,2.694,0.6295,2.6779,7.2398,3.9112,1.1051,0.6501,1.6208,1.3149,5.1968,0.0905,1.4305,3.3731,0.7779,7.2364,1.143,1.5749,8.2204,0.3938,8.5154,0.0069,0.0012,0.0003,8.8794,8.8647,0.5268,1.3664,2.603,2.6379,1.2677,5.1118,2.5778,3.9156,4.3369,0.4552,2.8864,0.9994,4.8304,0.7847,5.2863,1.2171,6.1951,0.987,2.4764,4.9352,3.2007,5.2984,4.1389,0.8732,3.0036,0.791,3.1233,1.0673,3.8903,2.1458,3.7023,2.2112,3.7511,5.5304,0.1051,0.2501,2.733,1.1101,3.555,3.2102,0.8779,2.7771,0.5155,7.9128,3.6345,7.5269,0.5054,3.6936,0.5113,6.4185,3.8209,4.9489,1.5088,1.3986,3.6579,2.446,2.6267,3.8622,3.1793,7.4853,6.8695,0.6267,3.308,11.978,3.0597,2.563,4.4898,5.4954,3.219,1.6933,5.7149,5.5395,1.1721,0.9141,6.2138,1.8522,4.5737,3.5283,1.1051,3.7443,4.0179,2.1294,5.6431,0.6797,1.7684,4.79,3.089,4.1466,9.6048,0.0227,4.5196,2.9445,3.1185,3.2827,4.8757,3.4209,1.3959,0.442,0.0458,6.6674,1.9324,6.3622,3.5833,3.3631,4.013,6.4386,2.1482,1.8842,4.44,5.2828,1.4314,0.5189,5.2529,1.6285,0.2432,3.6361,0.4981,0.5974,2.3878,5.9419,5.3729,5.1392,2.5153,5.0454,2.1291,0.8937,0.5033,5.1318,2.524,3.4181,4.1736,0.0014,7.4416,4.8743,0.3702,1.0215,6.7544,2.7653,4.9009,0.1491,4.9812,3.6635,1.8249,4.9167,10.8346,0.4128,2.3353,4.9291,2.795,1.0396,4.883,3.1481,1.319,0.1239,2.0941,7.399,0.2904,5.2341,10.7467,3.9665,2.2153,3.3619,1.8294,5.3685,3.4649,0.4393,3.1621,5.3582,2.1269,0.6711,2.3813,4.4754,3.4825,2.8232,2.5187,4.5369,0.6698,0.4708,1.2487,1.7858,3.7662,4.3352,1.5396,5.9964,4.5836,1.5656,6.8122,0.6465,3.0441,2.1493,1.4468,1.4175,8.8876,1.013,9.7701,0.1323,3.3405,0.408,0.354,0.9999,4.5002,0.1146,1.5251,4.4632,3.0773,1.1565,4.8545,7.8244,0.0043,6.2272,1.0627,1.9625,0.518,0.3866,4.4676,3.6831,1.258,3.2881,3.9286,2.7714,1.5906,3.3364,4.51,3.0895,0.8888,2.343,4.4776,5.2616,2.7255,2.0725,6.5904,0.2601,1.7027,1.5057,6.9583,5.8678,2.4177,0.6647,1.4641,5.4137,1.801,4.5861,0.0787,2.0903,2.1577,5.9029,1.096,5.4852,2.3617,3.1669,2.2449,2.3287,3.3698,3.6126,1.7936,3.6335,1.8457,1.4064,5.0628,4.5643,3.0725,5.3263,2.4852,4.5197,2.4033,1.1702,3.6985,5.2788,0.0238,0.6045,1.75,4.0,3.1877,0.1051,0.1243,6.935,2.7385,6.5403,0.0044,2.3961,6.9052,2.0283,7.0243,6.7406,6.2439,0.1518,5.3415,2.0022,1.2819,5.8025,3.0771,3.2324,0.0566,0.6611,1.1162,5.2121,3.3708,0.3409,1.4082,5.5242,2.3196,0.2501,3.2624,6.3455,0.0151,4.6813,0.014,0.1833,2.2404,3.1874,3.4172,0.1203,0.0113,2.3788,2.4125,2.7254,0.0159,2.6308,0.1255,2.4521,0.1914,4.5043,3.7095,0.5644,4.2727,3.7126,0.6874,4.3017,6.1772,2.4034,1.79,2.2241,0.0252,3.1983,3.1797,2.8428,1.6631,0.0309,0.0066,5.8773,5.6212,0.7409,0.6156,3.0582,4.6506,3.7677,0.2842,1.7591,2.6447,5.206,3.094,0.2544,3.3606,1.8017,1.2234,0.4995,0.245,0.2386,2.7179,0.5219]}

Directly addressing the","text":"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said there was no truth in reports that the White House had a plan to fire him and replace him with CIA chief Mike Pompeo. Directly addressing the report in a blog post on Foreign Policy, the British diplomat said: \u201cThese are completely baseless rumours.\u201d\nThe White House, in a statement to NBC News released after Pompeo\u2019s departure, said Pompeo was informed by Tillerson prior to his announcement that Tillerson would be stepping down on Monday.\nTillerson said, in his last day as US envoy to the United Nations in New York, that Pompeo, \u201cis someone who I\u2019m absolutely excited to have as my chief of staff.\u201d Tillerson said he has already had an open-door policy with the foreign policy establishment and they have been able to inform him of upcoming policy initiatives and take advantage of his knowledge of the intelligence community and foreign policy agencies.\n\u201cI think everyone can enjoy the benefits of knowing you have freedom to speak out and share with people on what you consider to be the best and the most prudent moves based on what you know,\u201d he added. \u201cThey can share those things with me and I can then go out to the media and I can use that knowledge to inform the debate at every level. I think it\u2019s been a good process over the years for both those of us.\u201d\nPrevious articleHow to Get the WORST Health Insurance Quoting from 3 Major Health Insurance Re comparison website\nRivers State Senate President, Senator Hope Uzodinma, has cautioned Governor Udom Emmanuel that the State Assembly will not accept a Governor who disregards the law, who violates his\/her mandate on budget approval or who does not listen to the issues of the society.\nUzodinma, whose House of Assembly colleague, Soke Ajayi Akinfenwa, is the Law Commissioner of the State, made the comments in a virtual press statement issued today, July 12, 2020.\n\u201cWe have made sure to be very careful about the Governor. It is now obvious that we have a Governor that we have no confidence in. We have a Governor that the majority of the people of Rivers State do not have confidence in.\n\u201cThere are many issues that were raised by this Assembly that we wish to bring to the table but we have to take the advice of the Ogunfani, Chief of Staff, who told me today he does not want anything on security issues to be discussed during this pandemic.\n\u201cThat is why we have avoided it. We have to remember that we are not discussing security issues during a pandemic. But the Governor has to listen to the people of Rivers State. We are not here to do favours to the Governor. We have never done a favour to any Governor.","token_len":586,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,2.377,4.6985,1.1774,0.9579,6.5365,2.4528,3.2973,0.6162,2.0201,4.2648,0.0021,1.4075,4.7829,3.6383,0.3221,5.0062,3.4643,3.3427,3.512,0.0562,1.0453,7.0476,3.777,0.6905,0.0004,0.0002,0.4948,12.3294,2.1413,5.9382,1.4017,3.3961,3.7167,1.0164,6.6597,0.1648,2.0294,7.3331,0.34,0.6729,2.5977,6.7268,2.6975,0.6064,1.539,11.9424,6.4224,6.5055,2.0334,4.5642,2.36,5.3748,1.2933,4.8557,9.6245,1.6478,9.605,2.9635,0.0017,3.7188,2.5211,1.3888,0.8529,2.598,4.1591,0.179,6.5627,3.8643,6.317,0.0004,15.9943,5.4595,1.7947,2.3041,0.1712,0.8335,5.5154,0.0007,1.3529,6.0866,2.2279,5.3411,5.6501,0.0027,1.2695,4.3316,1.0436,4.0845,0.7626,1.0817,3.7072,0.0258,2.8267,3.2412,0.444,0.9752,3.6079,0.0538,0.0003,2.142,3.6956,2.7289,2.7779,6.3905,3.226,1.1211,3.6352,5.7293,0.9378,0.8728,2.6467,0.0041,3.3291,3.4007,0.0284,0.2695,0.2707,4.1472,0.001,3.7346,10.4455,0.9888,6.3563,6.443,0.3935,5.2052,11.8336,4.9107,2.7428,5.0588,5.3775,1.3441,2.3758,2.8562,2.257,3.4064,0.5058,0.0521,1.012,2.0413,1.3212,5.8139,1.6023,1.8607,3.6079,4.2626,3.9409,3.3894,3.1352,4.5673,1.1394,1.4883,2.4234,1.2864,5.2346,2.3264,2.491,1.9191,4.3228,1.3899,1.5977,4.3023,0.0057,6.9572,0.7534,1.7135,8.5947,2.3606,3.8185,2.1207,5.3873,3.661,0.0383,1.2532,3.1956,1.0133,1.075,5.8313,0.2076,2.3386,4.7128,0.1752,8.6287,0.4805,0.5673,2.1571,1.7442,3.2785,2.6786,5.6606,3.7207,6.3507,1.597,3.7718,0.2391,3.9947,4.8743,1.9574,8.6142,1.6698,2.7477,2.9623,1.677,4.2154,3.0498,3.3663,3.9762,3.5576,0.6982,5.5163,0.6928,0.0079,2.1889,2.3136,2.7104,3.2276,0.7326,7.4853,5.4486,6.8147,0.0606,1.8453,0.7712,1.7925,2.6828,3.4424,2.2582,3.4851,1.0301,0.0735,2.6874,0.5618,4.6402,2.2265,3.6879,5.0895,3.0444,0.667,2.9473,1.6165,1.1359,1.4548,5.4514,3.4968,2.6479,3.307,2.3152,3.763,0.5984,3.9047,0.4187,5.4155,1.1569,2.5002,0.2855,2.0688,2.1318,6.7583,5.3522,4.4428,0.4901,1.4253,2.8801,0.9757,2.2613,2.7577,2.2729,0.2026,5.8785,1.1514,3.2829,2.1009,5.8519,0.1366,2.3695,2.5415,3.057,5.441,3.6895,0.1273,1.8243,1.6802,1.2582,0.2826,8.9047,7.1015,11.5095,2.6962,2.9277,3.2029,11.1367,0.1834,7.816,2.24,9.6321,6.39,1.3325,8.192,6.9937,1.6643,0.6735,7.0006,19.7782,5.4695,4.3064,6.7012,5.852,8.5885,8.0039,4.088,3.9839,3.411,11.6584,11.7734,9.3792,3.4016,10.4517,1.5544,3.5289,9.4236,8.1078,10.4958,9.3447,11.9897,2.0735,1.587,4.5075,6.7858,2.2868,1.171,4.5021,2.1593,6.04,2.259,7.0677,0.0261,0.9048,2.1999,2.6025,6.0684,3.3489,2.6382,8.0512,0.0144,5.4357,4.9554,7.3147,7.0546,2.3309,1.1983,3.0163,0.0694,5.5014,0.0458,0.8377,7.0559,1.8108,1.1725,8.5839,1.0309,0.9303,3.7384,4.2397,0.0035,0.0008,0.0048,2.5577,4.602,5.8603,1.7177,4.3197,5.5803,1.4989,9.6715,6.8598,8.9266,2.0228,3.2499,11.9806,8.5296,2.3655,0.3109,1.8389,2.1262,8.6997,6.0759,1.516,0.6146,1.493,3.8996,5.0865,0.3135,1.6651,1.5627,0.9278,9.843,5.073,5.0506,3.2013,4.6501,2.7494,5.6529,3.3349,0.8048,10.4012,0.7021,0.5599,3.0988,1.6803,3.2776,2.0928,3.5323,5.2348,2.6813,4.1143,3.039,2.2492,1.5789,2.3313,5.6181,3.4335,3.8331,0.858,5.2167,5.9745,0.4165,3.1835,1.8544,1.9617,2.919,2.9888,4.4981,1.9728,2.7186,2.7256,0.2796,0.8426,1.6248,0.9397,2.2618,0.5127,0.5285,4.4358,4.5019,0.1914,0.9721,1.0668,2.106,10.5832,0.2552,2.4192,0.0505,3.4807,1.5028,0.0762,0.6346,2.2507,1.1176,0.117,3.6817,1.3971,2.2643,3.5696,0.812,5.347,1.5994,1.8442,3.0149,5.6094,2.0225,1.6658,5.6183,0.6541,4.7358,0.4477,0.4298,3.9745,4.0859,1.6126,1.4094,1.8941,3.2185,2.4095,5.3371,0.2674,0.8091,8.9535,9.817,5.5896,5.6299,3.0386,6.4816,0.7114,0.9377,2.2328,2.1505,3.2238,1.5121,4.1964,3.9155,2.6739,0.0498,1.8677,6.5245,6.0889,7.963,2.6823,3.3104,1.4821,2.301,4.3771,1.8929,13.8171,0.0762,0.8722,1.216,0.8033,0.0478,4.3183,0.8264,1.2917,1.0417,1.1443,8.2904,3.2654,0.9423,1.4116,0.8345,2.9731,5.1442,0.4126,1.8767,1.1017,1.8075,6.6195,2.556,0.5821,4.1633,2.3314,0.1266,0.0007,0.6778,4.9797,3.0382,1.5855,1.8908,2.0857,3.8029,0.2061,0.7219,1.313,0.9492,0.7304,0.0749,1.3544,1.9373,1.937,1.1996,5.9903,0.1673,4.4427,11.1439,0.0019,1.422,1.5062,1.3686,0.9082,0.6341,2.0466,5.9049,1.8105,4.9374,1.4167,0.3326,3.5528,1.6648,0.8845]}

The tweet included a photo of Pence seated behind a podium and also a screen displaying the words \u201cHouse Passes Tax Bill\u201c.\nFormer Vice President Pence to preside over Senate vote to pass historic tax bill. The Vice President and the Senate will be joined by the House to make sweeping tax reform a reality. #taxrevolutions pic.twitter.com\/qVdJcj6l4q\nMore:\nCongress will use the day after the President\u2019s inauguration to work on the big issues of the day, as well as a new health care bill. In the first week of the new Congress, there will be a series of tax law battles with the House of Representatives taking the lead on the GOTV campaign.\nSen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate\u2019s longest-serving Democrat, said he was open to a bipartisan solution. Schumer also told reporters he had plans to work \u201cwith all of our party\u2019s leaders in Congress\u201d including Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). \u201cThe goal is to make sure people, especially families, don\u2019t face a double tax on their earned income,\u201d Schumer told reporters.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too soon for a tax reform,\u201d Pelosi said last November when she was seeking reelection. Pelosi noted that Democrats won the House in part because they called \u201cfor a great big tax overhaul to fund a lot of basic services.\u201d\nThis will be the most important legislative day since President Trump took office in January, and will be expected to be a showdown between the two chambers with Vice President Mike Pence acting as a neutral arbiter. Pence also appeared to be having a few words with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s son, Rep.

{"prompt":"Britain is seeking to build on the recent momentum in the Brexit divorce talks with the European Union before a summit next month , a spokeswoman for Britain s Department for Exiting the European Union","text":"Britain is seeking to build on the recent momentum in the Brexit divorce talks with the European Union before a summit next month, a spokeswoman for Britain s Department for Exiting the European Union said on Friday. Britain and the EU are continuing to negotiate a divorce free trade agreement that could be reached before May 31 and Britain is now targeting two important dates at the end of May, which could deliver the deal if negotiations work ahead of schedule. They include a summit between British Prime Minister Theresa May and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and a final UK-EU divorce agreement, the spokeswoman said through her side of a telephone conversation. Asked what the next two important dates for the negotiations were, the spokeswoman replied. a date on or around May 29 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Single European Act. In addition to the summit on May 29, the spokeswoman said her department wanted May to sign an agreement with her EU counterparts on May 31 as planned, on a basis on which the new deal will come into force on July 1. After that, if negotiations had progressed to the next phase, talks to come up with a free trade agreement would be prioritised, she added. In the meantime, Britain has been pressing for its position to be considered in the deal, with a spokesman for the European Union Commission on Friday praising the UK s efforts to secure assurances from the bloc that EU rules would continue to apply to British workers. In exchange, the EU has offered the prospect of granting Britain wider and more flexible access to the bloc s Single Market as well as leaving the bloc's customs union intact. However, according to the latest results from a telephone poll of leading European Commission officials on Friday, only 22 per cent of the people polled backed the UK receiving more access as well as maintaining intact rules applied under the customs union. The UK does, however, want to be included in a customs union. While the bloc has said that it would not be open to that, May is also being asked to sign this into the deal. Brexit negotiator David Davis is meeting with his counterparts from other EU member states in Luxembourg on Friday to discuss whether they have agreed to any compromise, the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman did not comment on any future dates for the Brexit talks. British ministers said on Thursday that it was crucial that the EU agreed to their demands before May 30, just seven days before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU, and before an exit day of the Brexit negotiations, unless they wanted to postpone it. EU leaders have repeatedly said they will not agree to any deal during May s six day summit in Brussels on April 7 unless there are assurances they will have the final say over the terms. British negotiators have indicated they may try to reach an agreement on a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the US, the EU s largest trading partner.

{"prompt":"Zimbabwe takes its next step into the post-Mugabe era soon , when its new president , Emmerson Mnangagwa , names two vice presidents - appointments that will signal whether he is breaking with the country","text":"Zimbabwe takes its next step into the post-Mugabe era soon, when its new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, names two vice presidents - appointments that will signal whether he is breaking with the country\u2019s long standing tradition of a one - man rule.\nBut Mnangagwa\u2019s choices are not unique to Zimbabwe. As a young leader, Mnangagwa faced the choice of which of two Vice Presidents to choose to help him lead both the country and his campaign.\nToday, even in the United States, a senior U. S. official is saying that the Obama administration, and perhaps the State Department as well, is not a fan of Mnangagwa as President. The official, who spoke to me behind the closed door of a Washington meeting, said he does not share the impression he and other senior Obama officials have received about Mnangagwa, but that his government, which, if confirmed, would probably be a strong and committed one, is not in danger as such.\n\u201c Mnangagwa, as a presidential candidate, had not been liked by a lot of people,\u201d the official said. \u201c But after winning \u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going that far.\u201d\nMnangagwa was the surprise presidential candidate for two reasons. First, it was not expected that a political veteran like David Gumsho ( the current vice president) will challenge him, and that a young man like Mnangagwa, who had run for parliament and has had some experience in the private sector, would have a shot at staking out the President post. Second, most of the media and commentators believed that Mugabe would retire in the near future.\nHis decision to run is a sign of a desire to challenge him to the next stage -- a sign, too, that he believes he has the capacity to do something for the country when he replaces him.\nIn one or two years, Mnangagwa will be the first in line to be challenged by another young - led candidate with ambition. But who will he be? The official I spoke with said that even though Zanu - PF officials have told Mnangagwa to try, there will not be a third candidate.\nAt this point, there are no candidates running. But the official said that in the future, both men are going to be considered. Both of them are, he said, young leaders who seem to have the capacity to take care of the country.\nAs the official said, he believes that if Mnangagwa is confirmed, he will show the world that his leadership is a positive force for the country.\n\u201cIt will certainly be an interesting challenge from a young person starting as a political leader, as it will be when a person gets ready to step into the shoes.\u201d","token_len":588,"entropy":[12.6439,9.1904,3.1226,7.1791,1.0014,4.6379,0.6703,5.5554,0.0544,4.6961,4.7652,1.0137,1.0347,8.054,1.433,3.1658,3.5366,3.546,1.2319,0.9435,6.4403,0.1742,0.0053,0.0001,0.0001,0.0,0.0,0.064,9.33,4.8315,6.5334,1.0079,4.3087,11.4083,0.9438,1.57,6.1361,4.7223,3.0779,1.7944,7.3521,0.5849,0.8629,2.9863,15.7525,7.9444,5.3811,3.4834,5.6909,2.5156,0.0828,4.7673,5.067,9.8537,7.9536,8.8811,0.3316,0.4837,14.2328,3.5478,0.0058,0.0013,0.0005,8.4467,0.4309,0.8268,6.5528,1.7954,2.1242,5.6907,1.1778,0.106,0.4845,4.103,2.5434,3.1192,3.5049,1.1314,3.3033,0.0154,0.0043,0.0009,4.3539,2.5467,5.1982,0.485,6.4836,1.8438,2.2418,7.5563,0.6404,1.605,3.2059,2.9502,6.5906,1.9554,2.8043,9.0721,1.2932,1.3459,0.9198,3.2324,7.314,1.47,0.7073,5.6414,0.2416,5.5368,3.2467,1.2278,4.675,0.0189,0.1374,3.3958,4.788,3.0142,0.0013,7.1224,0.0202,0.637,2.8795,2.731,0.7062,1.6586,5.126,0.2031,4.0947,3.6793,3.4133,1.7972,5.5045,0.0268,2.8359,0.2888,0.0634,2.0187,2.9203,5.0152,3.5968,0.0534,0.7115,0.0094,0.0032,0.0013,4.1364,3.3349,0.6339,3.4641,1.8006,1.6597,0.9014,0.6746,2.5839,6.4597,10.1117,3.2701,3.7847,2.4796,0.3782,1.8016,3.2298,5.8418,1.3501,0.6378,2.5818,3.3585,0.077,5.3153,1.0601,5.0332,4.7628,4.7792,1.9933,1.8809,3.6614,0.6047,1.1576,4.2971,3.0863,0.665,0.0079,0.0024,0.0012,2.7073,3.1545,1.0581,3.0285,4.963,3.8605,2.0767,5.6052,4.4162,4.2756,0.4115,0.812,4.9591,1.4339,2.6161,3.5624,4.0344,4.3698,3.8951,2.018,1.8942,2.5804,3.1521,6.1911,5.9905,6.2558,0.7868,0.2605,7.1582,5.4658,11.6394,0.0292,0.0028,0.0024,2.5016,3.5819,2.0144,5.2042,0.4146,0.347,3.1587,4.4109,1.8331,8.3498,0.8869,3.9745,2.2693,0.0297,1.272,1.6244,7.8698,6.5177,3.7056,0.2257,0.3184,0.8227,5.8783,0.3208,1.6055,4.6049,3.9976,11.2471,5.2553,3.0954,4.2487,2.8052,0.2155,0.8972,2.3901,2.6972,0.1388,0.1065,2.4321,9.7078,2.3809,0.8202,3.1799,3.5019,0.8316,3.7946,0.0175,0.0231,0.0012,0.0011,2.8657,3.1863,6.9484,4.6963,0.7909,2.8411,4.7763,1.0906,0.5542,0.9176,0.1386,2.903,0.9201,3.1873,4.2594,0.864,2.751,4.2782,5.9529,1.8288,7.9349,11.9386,3.8242,4.0325,3.5792,8.8105,4.0136,2.3535,0.3875,2.9539,4.3617,5.9027,2.0556,2.5285,1.93,3.6224,4.2302,3.9825,1.7047,0.7599,0.8701,0.014,0.0024,0.0011,2.3409,0.8041,1.9563,4.697,1.4736,7.2007,2.4692,4.5673,4.3268,3.3453,2.4727,0.7375,1.7572,4.3922,0.0178,0.2072,0.5594,2.665,1.8941,4.2738,0.2498,7.5756,0.8547,1.0877,1.4304,6.6263,5.1783,0.36,1.3637,0.0171,6.1537,1.3913,0.434,4.1351,2.9316,3.4384,6.4981,0.3012,4.1833,0.0006,1.7279,8.463,2.1328,1.6989,2.9159,0.1278,1.3665,1.0895,6.7662,3.4954,0.4346,1.442,3.7798,2.0717,3.285,1.0441,2.9038,6.4996,0.6259,5.1195,3.748,3.9871,1.5154,2.9056,3.1008,7.4667,2.5609,7.2625,3.1131,5.8585,0.0125,0.4901,1.9228,5.2607,1.6524,1.4475,1.8273,3.5641,0.2828,2.9643,3.7587,4.8058,0.6897,0.3666,4.9393,0.6823,7.6672,0.953,0.4941,0.8655,3.3719,5.0555,7.1411,0.2918,1.6581,0.249,2.4241,0.0283,0.0041,0.0021,1.2468,1.1345,2.1404,1.0762,4.1294,3.1376,0.5161,2.1109,8.0436,1.186,4.4427,4.239,9.4765,9.3269,4.3737,4.8174,7.4281,1.6426,3.1597,5.8182,0.9302,2.2873,1.1408,1.0995,2.302,3.5638,6.566,0.1026,0.7381,1.1036,0.8981,4.5015,1.9529,7.5985,0.2093,10.1646,14.4806,7.4026,2.5697,3.8731,6.7105,0.012,0.0036,0.0009,2.7699,4.6382,4.1229,3.4985,2.7532,2.2874,0.0503,1.0818,5.247,1.7822,1.5751,0.8684,5.4159,1.7629,0.3419,0.1613,3.0142,1.53,2.3289,4.2091,4.2046,2.6808,2.3313,2.2425,2.3701,0.7829,0.5432,3.992,0.8895,3.336,0.4256,5.2903,5.1243,2.673,2.9163,0.048,1.8217,3.4529,1.6213,5.9497,2.6677,0.5152,1.7005,4.6095,2.5455,0.2939,0.053,5.2474,4.541,0.9792,5.7661,0.5996,0.8485,1.7322,3.296,0.2245,2.7859,4.8752,0.0169,1.4385,0.3556,1.0198,0.6387,4.2607,2.6915,2.4668,0.9381,0.1333,3.0092,2.8309,0.6139,3.4569,1.5501,0.0137,0.0035,0.0018,1.7537,3.1188,0.8659,1.3997,0.3744,5.7182,2.0687,3.0915,0.5626,2.7714,2.5538,1.805,3.4054,5.4253,2.6076,1.4531,0.7689,0.3195,0.6137,0.7971,2.4686,0.8413,8.3265,2.8729,5.633,0.926,2.8405,2.4192,3.6488,5.3321,1.5673,0.5577,3.2239,7.391,4.2768,0.6906,3.8605,3.6567,1.6363,4.5471,3.0918,1.7657,0.6226,5.1744,3.3754,3.8393,4.8137,6.3625,0.2539,2.8191,1.8058,0.4432,3.2295,5.5403,1.1853,1.5587]}

Protesters were clamping down on the Catalan archaeological and artistic museum of the Tarraco Archaeological Park which holds pieces they claim as relics of an ancient biblical Jewish settlement. The museum, which includes a Sephardi Synagogue and an arch which many protesters claim was used as the entrance to the Temple of Jerusalem, had been closed after Friday s attack on police officers during the Spanish nation s Independence Day Weekend. In addition to the museum, other historic sites in Catalonia such as the monastery of Montserrat and monastery of Poblet had also been closed by the government s local government bodies on Monday. In the early hours of Monday, a group of protesters took a section of the park s main building, but were removed by security forces after clashing with police. Protesters claimed they were trying to reclaim some of the pieces they had stolen from the museum last Friday. Several dozen members of the Spanish Civil Guard joined the crowd, while others were marching towards the entrance, a security source told AFP. Spain s central government is keen to prevent an independence vote despite legal precedent in Catalonia to seek secession. The government warned any such attempt would give Catalonia s independence movement legal backing. The central government warned it will not allow such a vote while the government was currently on recess. In a rare address to the Spanish public, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy warned the people of Spain to vote, as the poll is scheduled for Saturday. He stressed that independence for Catalonia should be fought for on the streets via mass protest, rather than peacefully through legal means. Speaking from Catalan capital Barcelona, the prime minister warned that the central government would not turn a blind eye to any vote for independence. However, he added that Catalonia must not try to find legal support for a separation from the rest of Spain, and warned against such illegal action. Speaking at a rally in Barcelona, Catalan President Artur Mas, whose minority government is holding an independence referendum on Sept. 9, called on Spain s central government to immediately declare its intent to stop the voting and enforce a no vote resolution. A police force of more than 4,000 Civil Guard officers have been deployed in Catalonia to prevent separatists from preparing for a vote. But a number of the Catalan secessionist leaders said they plan to carry on with the vote despite warnings. The election is taking place amid fears that Spain may end up with a fractured and destabilised country because of territorial disputes. Many people say the independence movement has exploited fears of growing wealth inequality and unemployment to rally its support. But there are fears that such anger is fuelling a new generation of violence. Police and supporters have clashed in Catalonia for more than a year. The conflict has already claimed several lives.","token_len":588,"entropy":[10.3696,5.5788,0.15,0.3356,5.7363,0.0017,6.3248,8.9059,9.78,8.8132,0.0063,1.2698,1.5472,3.7592,0.6614,7.1811,2.8669,2.6402,1.3087,3.6397,1.947,0.8622,7.2742,0.0367,3.6637,0.652,3.4043,2.9561,0.0407,3.6511,11.0253,12.8007,0.0604,7.1956,0.0005,1.4989,4.1519,3.7131,3.9753,0.5146,1.1425,5.0272,10.2587,2.6185,1.4191,6.6575,0.123,6.6397,3.3175,10.1523,0.0111,0.0106,0.1375,1.4534,3.1425,8.7299,3.6078,4.54,4.6794,3.8325,1.7714,5.341,2.5421,6.625,8.0766,0.0565,2.2676,3.752,4.197,7.4696,9.0542,2.082,5.2335,3.9382,0.811,3.7829,0.4571,8.4961,5.7905,3.2837,0.9794,2.2013,2.5776,1.7234,0.8794,4.0683,1.4846,11.1639,0.0125,3.76,8.8738,0.0284,1.2305,2.5255,5.5405,8.0305,6.6041,8.8729,1.9114,2.0494,3.2457,1.2063,3.5679,6.7667,0.2814,0.7963,1.5419,0.2028,5.211,0.4134,3.4417,0.6741,3.0365,3.9187,7.1417,9.5337,6.5739,1.6137,2.771,3.4433,4.2763,1.4723,5.6685,8.9807,5.1226,4.7368,0.1255,7.3785,0.8095,4.0924,3.4705,0.5778,0.8504,2.5236,0.3989,4.4642,5.5132,1.2765,1.8949,0.7203,3.9645,0.0015,0.5575,5.9022,0.3527,5.9949,2.9288,0.0058,1.7904,7.4323,0.4162,3.8455,6.8897,3.9448,5.1281,0.5585,0.0869,1.8876,2.6342,1.6459,1.3235,5.8754,5.2988,1.0525,8.6022,3.8062,0.6905,0.6488,3.4833,2.1018,4.1588,0.1732,0.1275,0.3956,1.1695,2.6514,2.0249,0.1056,2.0359,4.3004,3.2298,7.9742,0.0626,0.6365,3.9262,9.2305,3.7019,5.3414,1.9313,5.177,1.8598,5.8595,1.0422,2.6238,0.8215,2.493,6.4085,0.0258,0.0247,0.7132,0.8785,4.9481,4.9482,1.653,0.8516,2.9658,0.0053,2.3234,3.4163,0.8951,0.1407,4.3236,2.8554,2.6324,2.9105,0.4987,0.2336,1.0745,5.8675,3.3372,0.8061,5.1537,4.7755,4.9306,0.0139,0.2822,4.0728,3.8087,1.0828,6.1884,0.8374,3.661,1.9468,3.4225,2.6526,1.9055,6.632,2.9662,0.3152,3.7982,3.522,4.3552,3.6679,0.3066,1.3038,1.7,0.3519,5.7587,2.8158,2.8593,0.0449,2.6529,4.7447,0.2791,3.3828,3.8915,2.7139,1.981,5.4975,6.655,7.0591,3.2159,1.1613,4.589,6.4488,3.7662,1.4855,1.8494,1.8472,6.6191,7.6296,3.62,4.0045,1.0307,6.3348,3.7732,4.6965,2.9688,7.8234,5.6843,3.0445,1.038,2.0899,5.6034,0.0682,5.0762,2.5497,4.6954,1.5715,1.7545,3.8805,1.0367,1.9138,5.8041,1.8506,2.7917,2.8554,6.6156,3.6358,4.5468,0.6402,3.721,0.9873,4.1496,5.7898,0.8642,1.2815,3.7235,3.6746,1.2247,1.6502,0.0019,0.0336,0.0,0.0001,0.0001,3.5181,1.898,4.6185,0.405,2.9815,3.2095,5.032,4.3926,3.6315,1.9438,6.8696,2.6854,3.4721,1.7527,3.388,0.5904,2.7072,4.4133,0.5534,4.8974,4.2183,0.5097,3.968,1.0048,4.9439,1.4307,4.4831,1.1402,3.7438,9.1138,4.319,3.4797,1.5975,2.8088,0.0104,5.6403,3.9443,4.3342,1.2853,0.2468,4.3916,3.3408,8.0291,1.8898,0.7086,0.394,2.6024,1.8938,0.0036,3.4436,0.8753,1.5743,6.4441,0.0319,1.2486,0.581,6.9741,0.9682,0.0202,0.002,0.148,1.8599,4.3145,3.2323,0.4416,0.9504,4.824,0.0831,0.8538,2.2569,0.2828,3.6412,3.7019,1.743,4.7945,0.2127,5.5999,4.5196,4.316,0.3521,1.9891,6.7233,2.9486,2.6168,2.2299,0.0028,0.3831,1.9519,2.6723,2.3629,2.5581,4.642,6.5637,3.3571,0.4414,3.9228,2.0702,0.7359,2.5548,0.6467,1.0782,0.974,2.8946,1.6848,6.2995,0.0031,0.0127,3.4037,4.1727,6.5368,1.6711,1.4244,4.9158,2.7607,1.4165,0.087,1.3554,5.4512,0.5261,2.9549,0.1193,2.4414,0.9438,3.2523,0.9676,2.0397,0.0633,0.1188,4.3434,3.6425,3.5501,3.3246,0.1199,5.3022,1.2732,5.6583,2.9697,7.459,1.8979,4.3782,1.5325,8.4156,0.8537,4.4007,5.2673,4.5689,3.5024,2.976,0.0024,5.0269,0.0088,0.1336,7.9761,0.3031,2.3376,4.6998,0.3322,0.2718,1.455,0.6171,1.4225,2.9839,6.6636,0.2868,8.271,1.5195,1.3901,1.1126,1.1259,5.2018,3.4897,3.4917,0.0285,3.7477,2.9035,6.2049,0.9417,1.9583,3.3563,0.7682,6.1005,0.0973,5.6647,2.6061,1.6982,1.3497,3.9364,3.4353,4.7459,4.1345,2.6877,7.2387,1.7377,5.1902,0.0106,4.4057,3.2242,0.8288,3.4345,2.8387,4.1458,0.0728,1.0051,0.7443,5.5509,2.3045,5.6319,0.5741,3.0386,6.7572,0.2274,6.5867,0.3519,2.047,4.7565,3.5425,3.9549,1.4261,2.6751,2.1713,1.696,5.618,5.0524,1.1402,5.184,8.1294,2.0472,1.0893,5.3341,1.3105,4.5194,5.5212,1.7591,0.8238,3.9847,3.8421,1.4355,1.5948,0.4891,4.0011,4.8726,2.8267,2.5869,0.0003,1.9739,3.1973,3.2516,0.0932,4.5043,1.9133,4.6115,3.2308,4.9787,2.7438,0.8652,1.7095,3.0783,2.5666,2.1675,0.0004,0.7399,0.4899,1.9739,2.4325,4.7559,0.7905,4.9301,2.7929,4.1771,0.6011,1.2288]}

Sri Lanka has used the 1979 Prevention of Terrorism Act to arrest thousands and imprison some for up to 17 years.\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena\u2019s Government has used vague descriptions of terrorist suspects including the term \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d, to arrest thousands and imprison some for up to 17 years.\nThe United Nations on Friday urged the Sri Lankan government to urgently implement reforms to end war-time arbitrary detention and strengthen independent monitoring of tough legislation.\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena\u2019s Government has used vague descriptions of terrorist suspects including the term \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d, to arrest thousands and imprison some for up to 17 years.\nAmnesty International said on Friday that many detainees faced the risk of torture or other ill-treatment, while others faced little or no legal representation. Last week, Amnesty International and other rights groups filed a report with the independent UN human rights commission in Geneva, calling for an end to indefinite detention.\nLast week, Sirisena\u2019s Government introduced a draft legislation to ease such detention, which could be approved in Parliament after discussions this month after five weeks of protests by those arrested under the 1979 Act.\n\u201cThe new legislation does not address all the root causes of the detention crisis. It fails to address arbitrary arrest and detention in the very beginning of proceedings, fails to guarantee due process, fails to guarantee that the detainee\u2019s rights will be fully respected, and fails to address the root causes, which includes, among others, the lack of adequate investigation\u201d said Tim McVeigh, senior crisis expert at Amnesty International.\n\u201cIt is also critical that Government steps up independent monitoring of this detention law, and ensure judicial remedies. While we understand that there are legal challenges to this legislation that could delay its implementation, there must also be a rapid implementation of reform to end the indefinite detention of thousands,\u201d said McVeigh.\n\u201cThe Government must immediately stop the arbitrary detention of undischarged detainees and ensure that human rights violations and abuses are investigated and prosecuted; if cases prove to be well-founded, perpetrators must be held accountable and sanctions imposed. Such an approach will ensure accountability and prevent a potential breakdown in the rule of law by bringing an end to the unacceptable level of arbitrary detention,\u201d added McVeigh.\n\u201cThose in power must urgently abandon the use of the 1979 Prevention of Terrorism Act (1979-POTA) and the other anti-terrorism laws, instead work towards creating a legal framework which will end arbitrary detention on the basis of terrorism or any other suspicion. In the meantime, all prisoners should be treated humanely and guaranteed the right to access independent legal counsel throughout their detention,\u201d said McVeigh.","token_len":588,"entropy":[6.9248,2.5412,5.2597,1.9088,2.7791,1.2246,8.3706,0.1233,0.0246,0.1057,0.1311,5.0789,4.7987,2.8885,0.8846,4.9162,6.9412,3.695,4.1259,8.6619,0.5294,1.3156,6.9625,6.6512,4.6775,0.9333,11.5516,8.1545,1.1665,6.0345,0.964,1.6532,5.2409,1.4689,7.9806,8.5855,0.0652,4.7188,0.0998,0.6083,4.4158,3.6812,4.7473,3.0848,3.6141,5.6819,2.1522,0.0005,5.2948,0.0749,1.1176,0.7716,20.1969,4.0094,0.0582,0.0003,0.0063,0.0438,0.018,0.0037,13.0959,11.7332,5.0053,4.9083,1.6291,4.7101,7.3003,7.1566,0.085,7.3033,3.195,5.5653,2.989,5.584,8.8413,5.5985,11.0724,0.4228,0.7755,8.1244,2.6297,3.1137,5.9423,3.3329,2.6237,1.5189,0.6895,0.2679,0.2124,0.0004,0.1852,0.0022,0.6485,1.0,1.9224,2.5066,0.2314,1.701,0.0984,0.0739,0.1193,0.0163,0.0052,0.0003,0.0216,0.0016,0.0001,0.0196,0.0073,0.0032,0.0126,0.0012,0.0104,0.0006,0.0053,0.0136,0.0112,0.0264,0.0022,0.0038,0.0023,0.0114,0.0076,0.1162,0.8354,5.7335,0.0485,0.0,0.0035,0.0059,0.0024,0.0002,0.001,0.3346,0.0003,0.003,0.1354,0.0169,0.0024,0.8933,0.0032,0.0007,0.014,0.0012,0.0337,0.0118,0.0014,0.0247,0.0057,0.0215,0.0013,0.0082,0.0021,0.0018,0.0032,0.0088,0.0203,0.0008,0.0479,0.0043,0.0024,0.0006,0.0006,0.0009,0.0011,0.0023,0.1254,6.7462,0.0436,0.0299,1.7354,2.1284,0.4994,0.4467,5.53,3.1815,5.1442,3.5184,2.0059,0.0313,2.0047,1.8388,2.0787,1.6991,0.1672,0.0027,2.2594,2.7396,1.5908,2.9112,6.4027,0.8567,0.0145,2.7675,4.2541,0.4077,7.2971,1.097,0.4665,2.3386,0.4367,3.6905,1.7255,2.242,0.3217,3.6332,0.417,2.9324,1.694,0.2518,7.9068,3.6401,2.18,0.0114,1.5606,2.3225,1.0572,2.3705,1.7651,0.8168,2.448,0.8859,0.0109,2.7834,0.1319,1.9134,0.347,4.9983,0.5705,0.0057,9.9062,0.0241,0.0037,0.3825,0.0074,0.0285,0.5457,4.8222,1.2613,2.9024,2.7906,1.3823,5.5541,4.196,3.4013,1.3947,1.5563,3.8978,1.4752,3.8793,2.3117,4.3158,4.4962,6.4633,5.6784,2.0152,7.4037,6.3315,3.7783,0.5745,6.44,1.9108,5.3334,3.8749,4.6446,0.3734,5.5634,2.0232,0.1561,0.4176,5.7902,1.9435,3.6565,3.6223,1.0828,4.6568,0.0548,2.6262,5.2059,1.7233,8.0962,0.0375,0.2234,1.2747,2.8124,4.3838,1.995,1.439,6.6365,0.0272,0.9758,6.9958,3.641,1.2319,1.9289,2.8564,1.9347,6.5193,5.3033,0.8388,5.386,1.2082,6.0053,0.0158,5.6194,3.9584,0.0408,1.4976,1.9399,0.0052,3.3673,2.3176,2.1741,3.8585,8.9951,3.8387,0.1271,1.1497,2.7002,0.294,3.946,1.076,0.8325,0.4811,0.8434,0.0163,2.4919,0.6892,3.8181,0.1398,6.4065,2.6275,6.1014,3.8648,1.7139,0.6583,0.0358,1.3214,3.3045,0.002,2.1677,6.583,8.9378,3.5574,10.317,6.7306,5.2485,3.7253,0.0123,0.3311,3.8575,9.5544,5.1803,0.549,0.2595,0.101,0.2146,0.2195,1.0757,0.1596,2.9833,1.5793,2.3588,5.3573,0.6052,7.4403,6.3767,2.9206,5.3378,1.2889,0.5114,4.6234,3.1521,3.7394,1.3405,2.5191,3.7859,7.0235,4.9191,3.391,4.921,3.8684,4.1986,0.6962,2.528,0.7958,4.2672,1.6978,0.5802,1.6244,1.7557,3.4629,2.5691,4.9431,2.1274,0.544,0.3114,2.797,4.5526,1.5751,0.0263,1.7141,7.1966,3.3954,1.0741,4.2719,2.2345,4.3423,1.5572,3.1292,0.0341,2.2232,4.097,3.4772,7.7706,1.8849,0.4662,3.1184,0.0021,0.0001,0.1078,0.1977,1.112,0.1029,1.6017,2.3672,1.242,4.125,4.4543,1.688,2.9754,0.3987,0.4532,11.1559,1.199,1.5108,1.43,1.65,0.6779,6.4794,0.0133,3.6181,3.0406,1.9823,0.8632,3.0229,1.0037,1.3556,5.908,6.7185,6.9636,6.4271,1.0022,0.1057,8.0858,0.8693,0.0694,0.2987,6.2841,1.3854,0.1179,2.1301,0.3798,1.9361,7.564,1.4512,2.5049,5.8364,2.1562,1.4236,2.1751,2.7603,3.211,1.1469,4.4185,4.4122,6.1268,6.9156,0.6504,1.3093,3.3926,0.0095,0.0008,3.8117,5.9273,4.2451,0.2315,0.0054,1.5147,9.3014,4.1289,0.0089,1.6112,0.2461,2.979,0.5972,0.8252,2.4516,0.4814,0.0025,0.0001,0.0316,0.1662,0.9604,0.0398,6.3256,4.17,4.01,1.2062,3.5013,7.6013,1.0641,2.3872,0.0162,2.3864,1.9708,3.2936,0.032,0.003,0.0082,5.3937,7.6379,5.699,5.8484,4.3935,0.5232,1.1378,3.1786,4.3349,4.6768,0.0213,0.6703,0.8305,1.848,6.4891,6.6102,2.2678,3.9261,0.9141,2.5915,0.3729,3.8148,1.9921,5.2841,1.5815,0.1444,5.55,1.3036,0.2943,0.0657,6.3718,3.5498,3.7453,0.1931,7.471,1.88,3.8651,2.0928,1.2312,0.0344,4.05,5.2469,1.9959,0.322,3.4326,2.032,0.0018,0.8657,7.4839,1.3829,0.7213,0.0491,4.9007,5.5917,1.2173,1.7794,6.3668,0.2858,0.699,1.6273,0.3529,0.789,0.4819,0.6596,0.0023,0.0001,0.0332]}

And, I mean, you have to ask why they had those feelings towards me and my person and I don't know -\nFRANKEN: and that would explain why they wanted to kiss each other. And I said, \"Well, I don't know, man. Maybe because I was a little sleepy. Maybe because I was sleepy and maybe because I remember the kiss was a long time ago. Maybe because I slept at a hotel after the show. I never - I can't say whether that would have been a good or a bad thing.\"\nFRAMKEN: well, I think that's a good point and to ask people, \"Would you kiss somebody over there if you're just sleepy and you're not thinking about it?\" I'd say sure.\nFRANKEN: the kind of thing my wife and I could talk about.

{"prompt":"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last month tightened his control over the State Department by taking back powers previously held by the top career foreign service officer , an action critics said would delay","text":"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last month tightened his control over the State Department by taking back powers previously held by the top career foreign service officer, an action critics said would delay critical policy initiatives.\nWhile the new rule takes effect next year, the State Department is trying to work out all the details of it within the government over the next six months \u2014 a period that might not give Tillerson enough time to put a new strategy in place.\nA top State Department official told the AP that changes are needed to deal with some of the complexities of the Department\u2019s operations and to give top leadership a broader view of the overall work. (more\u2026)\nTillerson may have finally decided to cut back on the State Department but he doesn\u2019t give it a whole lot of time. In order to prevent himself from getting fired by Trump, his administration will take back the key power of selecting and firing officials at the Department, making it essentially easier for Trump to unseat Tillerson as the secretary of state.\nIt took Tillerson quite a while to reach his decision but now he\u2019s probably given up on convincing Trump to stay. This news comes in a letter sent to his staff that said the office of the secretary of state will also change its name to the office of the secretary of international and regional affairs. Tillerson\u2019s actions come after Trump said earlier this morning that if Tillerson didn\u2019t fire him right away, he would fire him himself and replace him with Secretary of State Jeff Sessions.\nBy this week, according to the letter, Secretary Tillerson\u2019s office will be renamed to Secretary of International and Regional Affairs. (more\u2026.)\nThe White House has been under fire lately for its handling of the Russia investigation. The last weeks have seen President Trump repeatedly accuse former Attorney General Jeff Sessions of not getting tough on Russians interfering in the 2016 election, telling Fox News that it\u2019s \u201cjust a matter of time.\u201d\nTrump also has said that Sessions\u2019s recent appointment of U.S. attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch to lead the DOJ was a \u201cshameful decision,\u201d and now he has come to add yet another blow to Sessions\u2019s case when he accused the attorney general of not fighting back against Russia. The former president went out of his way to tweet out his belief that there was collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign. (more\u2026)\nThe White House has fired the last person who was tasked to prevent this fall\u2019s election cycle from becoming the Trump presidency. As previously reported, Rex Tillerson was fired from the White House over an interview with the New York Times last week where he alleged there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. As such, former CIA Director John Brennan was forced to take over while Tillerson was out. He now looks more certain to be replaced by FBI Director James Comey.","token_len":589,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,7.5302,1.3365,11.0757,2.7853,4.633,0.3759,0.9538,2.5533,0.0031,2.9057,3.9046,5.7499,4.7544,4.9508,1.9513,0.1085,1.1515,5.2017,7.7131,5.238,2.8751,1.8893,1.7811,5.4194,2.3418,6.5239,1.9557,2.3887,7.3151,7.2212,5.4538,3.8941,0.9854,0.3459,18.3632,1.9834,3.2091,4.3306,4.7482,1.4122,2.7444,1.2626,0.0656,1.8914,3.3836,0.026,2.3496,5.4927,0.0431,4.7048,0.7252,6.0493,0.9632,0.7144,1.1518,5.6621,5.4921,0.8792,4.1646,7.8138,0.1764,0.2252,2.964,0.1887,4.5621,2.9752,5.3007,1.1148,4.8819,3.3,5.9446,3.7639,1.8027,0.0863,0.0575,4.893,3.1871,3.6501,4.7539,1.3095,0.0697,0.8993,0.2425,12.3425,3.8775,2.0454,0.0341,0.0618,1.6997,2.6327,3.0876,0.7664,6.7076,2.7583,2.8733,0.5441,5.4703,0.0118,3.8986,0.2834,0.1966,5.1492,1.2987,1.4603,4.9993,15.7237,7.3528,3.8689,3.7169,2.0221,3.252,4.7527,5.6105,4.6676,2.2429,4.4573,3.0824,0.41,1.2443,5.7654,3.9077,1.539,5.5742,7.9546,1.579,0.2689,6.3403,0.0212,0.0,5.4994,1.7878,5.755,3.4662,0.758,4.6629,2.3234,0.253,1.9294,1.8614,0.0691,6.6727,1.4149,4.6349,7.5168,1.6275,0.3241,6.5281,3.1559,2.8071,4.9876,0.1092,0.2145,1.0494,1.2158,3.2517,5.2366,0.1399,5.4859,5.2247,0.2552,3.0027,2.9401,3.362,2.8378,0.4325,4.4907,2.9524,2.228,4.9373,3.3346,1.7931,4.7862,5.0212,2.6077,5.6312,2.6557,2.4668,3.4652,3.4532,0.5037,2.5741,3.0996,5.7841,0.698,6.7335,6.8642,0.3813,2.5906,0.1751,6.3714,0.8107,1.7737,3.2223,1.8571,3.0231,0.4132,0.1401,0.3773,0.5038,3.7447,5.7189,2.7909,6.5454,0.5353,0.3769,0.2854,4.9595,1.7971,0.7628,2.9394,2.563,0.9325,2.162,0.2692,0.0186,5.8833,6.3059,1.4763,1.2227,10.5089,2.6207,0.9392,4.9046,2.9891,4.2841,5.3529,1.4993,3.6887,2.4724,4.4436,1.5532,0.8403,3.6128,2.4639,3.9372,5.4274,1.8251,6.078,2.8865,1.3324,1.9391,0.2605,0.086,3.1804,5.2831,5.3697,0.6245,3.5565,0.4759,0.6792,4.1766,0.1143,0.5851,1.6919,0.0403,6.8519,5.3581,2.3935,0.2126,0.8555,3.7885,2.1036,0.0557,0.0338,6.1669,4.3351,1.8069,2.3565,3.6388,4.085,0.1116,6.5367,0.3244,4.2133,2.6049,4.1405,0.4246,0.2127,0.9655,4.457,1.5189,6.2237,0.3258,0.4702,0.5207,0.6499,3.4452,1.7166,3.8166,3.8709,3.033,0.0509,0.3763,5.1641,0.2086,0.0266,7.9769,0.6252,0.5588,0.6151,6.2062,4.1387,4.7117,0.2741,5.544,0.0011,1.5001,2.3312,0.3279,4.6811,0.6658,1.4264,0.019,0.0162,2.666,2.1231,1.326,2.7067,1.6625,6.7231,0.1675,6.6935,0.742,0.313,0.0456,1.075,3.7443,0.3161,5.344,6.596,0.2487,2.0029,4.2119,0.0018,1.6054,2.0519,4.4175,1.4298,3.693,0.1379,1.4568,1.8111,0.0248,0.8309,2.419,0.6245,1.192,1.9419,6.1265,7.1606,0.4234,1.0745,4.0002,0.3196,4.8789,3.1031,3.2999,3.5628,0.0019,0.8486,0.0004,0.1045,3.946,5.0489,6.6909,0.5093,6.8079,6.3604,0.2724,0.0961,0.2357,0.4479,2.0268,6.0448,4.6758,0.067,1.0986,3.7644,6.1805,0.7563,0.1201,9.9923,4.9554,5.4583,1.4108,2.3341,0.0107,0.5881,2.4471,6.9817,7.8968,1.5758,3.9728,2.257,2.7837,3.3591,0.5792,3.8233,4.9042,0.1728,0.1549,5.2241,4.193,1.2894,5.8459,0.0015,0.0019,0.0074,1.6903,0.5843,5.1411,3.047,0.0,0.0106,1.3048,2.8329,0.0372,3.7245,2.0905,1.244,10.802,0.7427,7.9202,1.1038,0.7288,2.8225,3.208,3.6765,2.731,1.8765,4.6195,1.5221,3.3963,4.8799,2.4785,9.0815,5.5586,0.1366,6.4644,0.1327,5.5079,0.7724,0.015,0.0619,3.5218,4.5051,0.3134,4.4027,1.7775,2.3667,0.0126,0.2297,1.8426,6.569,1.8011,0.7855,2.0498,1.8562,3.2662,3.9308,5.4978,5.3876,4.8282,0.1508,0.0024,0.0001,0.0476,6.3726,3.6987,2.0923,5.1048,0.0837,4.0975,1.4281,4.6665,0.2357,0.6299,2.9922,0.0423,0.8722,0.2693,0.0969,1.4043,2.7197,0.2126,0.336,0.1611,2.1658,2.3446,0.0021,1.0783,6.3633,2.5755,4.7331,5.8585,1.7312,1.8377,6.0142,4.3284,7.002,4.7155,6.995,4.3892,1.0313,0.3809,4.8586,4.5146,1.7506,3.3344,1.482,5.2554,3.3521,0.4573,4.7319,4.3529,0.1571,0.3891,6.8771,0.0612,2.3976,1.9647,2.0658,0.7663,4.2931,0.0046,4.0481,3.6618,5.3147,1.366,1.9955,1.8077,0.1056,0.0534,3.2398,0.9283,4.4674,0.137,4.7813,4.8025,0.5534,1.1327,0.0929,0.5624,0.7586,0.0845,0.0272,0.6455,0.4903,4.6712,4.3262,0.0656,5.062,3.6481,0.5743,1.3338,0.0069,2.0508,3.3222,0.083,5.5124,1.5306,6.833,1.7554,0.6307,4.3356,1.8076,4.8824,3.7416,4.9195,3.2713,6.9143,1.8252,1.7454,2.3929,0.7213,6.6442,0.1337,0.1761,0.0424,0.6328]}
{"prompt":"The United States has called on the U.N. Security Council to blacklist 10 ships for circumventing sanctions on North Korea , documents showed on Tuesday , while South Korea s President suggested delaying military exercises","text":"The United States has called on the U.N. Security Council to blacklist 10 ships for circumventing sanctions on North Korea, documents showed on Tuesday, while South Korea s President suggested delaying military exercises that Pyongyang had been threatening as retaliation.\nWith no resolution needed to send the ships, officials confirmed the U.S. administration is holding the ships and crew directly accountable to the U.S. government.\nIn a phone message, President Donald Trump instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to call the international community, using the U.N. as the platform, to make clear that the United States would no longer recognize shipping companies or oil tankers associated with the North Korean maritime industry, the documents seen by The Associated Press show.\nHe also asked Pompeo to blacklist the ships, according to them.\nThe Trump administration s top diplomat could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday. The White House did not immediately reply to questions from The Associated Press.\nThe move comes a day before planned military exercises between troops from the U.S., South Korea, Japan and Australia to be held in the Sea of Japan in eastern Japan, Seoul announced Monday.\nThe plan is meant to send a strong signal of North Korea s hostility toward South Korea, and could increase tensions in the region, analysts say. North Korea threatened earlier on Monday to retaliate by temporarily disabling its Wonsan nuclear reactor.\nThe White House asked the U.S. International Maritime Security Agency for a list of Chinese and Indian companies that provide services to North Korean or Venezuelan ships, the documents show.\nIn addition, the United States asked India to share the name of companies that have facilitated fuel deliveries to the North Korean maritime industry, according to the documents, showing the administration s use of the most stringent possible language. They show Trump s administration is using the U.N. Security Council sanctions and the authority of the U.S. ambassador for the issue, the most important international mechanism that Washington can call upon when using economic or military pressure on foreign countries.\nThe moves are a part of a larger campaign in the United States where the administration and other officials are urging Congress to pass a resolution imposing sanctions on North Korea. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told journalists Monday that Washington will continue pressure on Pyongyang for its long-range ballistic missile program that critics say could be used to attack the United States.\nKelly said the administration has been in dialogue with European allies and a range of allies, including allies of the U.S. in Asia and Latin America. He said that despite President Trump s call for a summit with North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un, his administration believes an important first step is imposing sanctions.\nHe said the administration has asked Congress to increase sanctions. But the White House has not sought authorization for a potential trade embargo aimed at stopping the sale of products from North Korea to the United States, a source familiar with his concerns said.","token_len":590,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,1.8286,6.4765,1.279,1.6159,3.8503,0.0017,0.6711,0.0365,0.6492,0.0008,0.1886,6.8656,6.2097,8.8499,3.8712,10.2904,0.0051,2.6827,2.1472,2.2773,0.1414,1.3825,9.2498,4.0454,2.0023,1.7293,3.0506,3.7693,4.4634,0.3142,10.6179,8.319,14.844,8.6014,5.6616,1.7639,4.3007,3.1281,3.3015,3.4909,5.0273,4.8862,2.9098,0.8155,0.1985,17.9089,4.2785,4.2154,6.9032,1.2689,5.1994,1.3926,0.7822,2.1538,4.8802,5.9975,1.8122,2.6596,0.0014,0.35,0.0656,6.0366,2.681,4.5561,3.4587,1.2815,3.6292,7.4326,7.8828,1.5383,3.8851,0.968,1.4952,0.0009,3.6513,0.0969,2.231,0.7818,0.3146,3.0804,1.0265,4.5855,4.0805,1.4298,5.2594,2.2913,0.0195,7.2862,2.9284,0.0087,0.0497,11.1284,0.4266,0.0012,0.3901,4.163,1.6294,5.657,0.5882,3.4058,6.5552,0.6442,3.598,0.0011,0.5383,0.3875,5.2836,1.4128,5.4639,2.3509,1.0719,4.0626,2.4855,1.1304,1.1845,1.9964,0.0085,2.0634,4.5338,0.0145,5.6477,10.3258,4.4029,4.2034,6.9623,7.3848,0.0018,6.7696,0.0074,2.2428,0.6496,1.2187,8.019,4.9758,2.0959,1.8181,2.1691,6.7429,0.0078,1.2621,0.6016,0.0014,1.1222,0.0133,0.1442,6.2647,0.6853,2.5575,2.366,0.0009,0.2441,9.3,1.9078,2.5371,2.0289,3.8936,0.002,6.1497,0.7745,0.2677,1.4495,3.9888,0.0887,8.5787,7.8955,1.1041,6.0875,1.6379,0.9235,0.0628,0.0116,0.1089,0.0139,2.6584,0.5812,3.322,2.046,0.0018,1.212,0.0275,0.5891,3.5914,0.0749,3.5809,1.6887,0.4795,0.2236,0.0015,0.7374,0.1397,1.2541,4.7816,1.3252,2.6403,0.6237,2.5893,9.1097,1.6747,1.0473,1.7077,9.0936,1.3666,1.2005,1.2227,0.0016,0.017,2.439,0.7356,0.0566,1.2291,0.1954,0.4322,2.5727,4.2296,5.4447,0.5731,0.5165,0.9646,4.8923,0.0004,0.0004,3.2318,6.9725,1.8449,1.5533,8.1804,4.4023,3.1278,0.2215,0.3173,1.1442,5.4116,1.9239,3.4341,0.0906,3.6231,1.2846,2.6325,1.6488,3.5497,3.4416,0.1239,7.1525,6.1989,0.8584,2.9953,0.0553,1.189,2.8132,3.5614,5.4408,1.1408,1.9572,0.2636,0.7449,1.2069,3.5647,1.208,0.0593,4.5157,0.1802,5.3477,3.5841,3.504,0.6235,0.6784,3.5518,1.3682,7.909,5.9527,1.5526,9.6624,0.0476,0.0015,2.0256,1.6419,1.9586,0.2519,1.2761,3.9618,0.0015,6.8779,1.1456,1.3165,0.0007,1.3811,0.0226,6.0322,2.7757,3.3923,2.8734,3.6537,1.975,2.1074,0.0181,5.3652,2.4148,4.7925,3.5133,1.0431,5.5287,2.3763,0.2342,0.5748,1.9149,7.1013,6.2184,1.9258,1.164,2.2685,0.4238,0.5697,0.0487,0.5758,3.1275,3.1046,0.6079,0.9725,2.6913,0.27,3.438,6.1205,0.6046,5.6977,2.3924,3.868,0.3258,4.7545,1.1874,3.2948,6.7508,7.3641,3.3511,0.6081,1.4742,0.4876,0.9909,4.5345,0.2102,0.9643,1.7662,0.0058,0.4221,0.3452,1.974,5.6636,1.8468,3.887,3.7735,7.3409,0.0708,0.9481,7.5483,5.4306,5.734,4.493,1.5806,6.6509,6.7687,5.7217,2.008,3.7527,2.3622,4.1327,0.8403,3.2131,0.001,0.4328,0.1544,3.3472,0.002,7.5637,4.2331,2.2701,6.5738,1.0278,0.3845,1.1445,0.0011,1.9278,0.025,4.4485,4.2107,2.0783,3.6201,1.9189,3.3335,6.1634,3.1098,4.8746,4.217,3.5268,6.0668,2.1583,5.9634,0.8922,5.0028,6.198,7.469,4.3742,1.1343,2.1068,2.1168,6.1204,1.5879,0.5505,0.0959,1.0857,6.0439,2.3981,2.6383,5.9064,0.0022,0.8001,3.0289,3.2181,4.1515,1.6446,1.2535,0.0281,6.7492,1.356,1.1374,3.7578,3.3594,2.6706,1.6506,3.994,2.8285,0.2042,1.8972,1.5153,1.2809,5.0764,1.1753,0.6875,0.4057,0.066,1.5965,6.595,0.0023,4.4739,0.0417,0.0006,1.7196,0.0741,2.8849,6.1569,2.7555,0.4553,4.3509,2.6463,1.8391,5.9916,0.5916,1.9961,3.595,1.7478,6.2727,0.0898,0.6502,2.7451,0.3036,1.742,4.1423,5.9232,0.4091,1.76,1.8019,2.2465,0.5187,3.4251,0.6506,1.1149,0.0055,0.6161,0.2018,4.441,0.922,1.1792,1.3348,2.5757,2.1602,3.7095,4.5809,0.0469,7.1882,3.0888,1.7236,5.5316,3.8587,0.0069,4.2586,1.8432,0.5499,6.5792,1.5755,1.8094,1.8966,0.0005,0.0682,0.7786,2.3667,2.3151,1.1087,2.4691,0.0019,1.007,2.2083,0.8311,2.4202,4.7209,5.5834,0.6428,1.496,4.1657,0.5862,1.943,7.1343,1.607,2.2746,0.2741,7.2159,1.8239,0.7277,0.0334,0.0606,0.9921,4.2229,1.1318,3.7919,5.6933,4.707,4.6789,0.198,1.2723,7.1859,0.8143,1.215,0.1818,4.672,0.6011,1.1843,1.5304,2.102,4.134,2.93,0.3191,5.6422,1.746,3.9301,4.3991,2.3326,1.6005,0.0019,1.8167,1.5521,5.3544,4.5485,1.7252,2.2612,7.3278,5.8608,3.4029,6.355,0.0133,4.4322,1.9289,2.8161,0.1099,4.8872,1.9812,0.4113,0.0512,1.675,1.4346,0.6852,0.0098,1.0928,2.8864,3.6102,0.6958,0.0007,4.913,6.6454,0.6342,0.293]}

A White House","text":"The White House said late on Thursday that it can not lawfully pay subsidies to health insurance companies under the Obamacare health law, prompting howls of protests from Democratic lawmakers. A White House official told reporters that while it could not legally make payments to insurance companies it did have the option to delay payments to hospitals.\u201dThe Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to delay payment for services,\u201d said the official, adding that it could possibly \u201cdelay payments for a year for the hospitals that are already impacted by uncompensated care.\u201dThe official added that the administration had not yet \u201cdecided what we would do\u201d because it is weighing the possibility of the payment cuts taking effect soon after the health law was signed or in 2017.The official did not specify what form the delay payments would take.Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, have asked Obama to reverse the pause in payments to insurers.House Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told reporters on Thursday he was demanding a guarantee that such a pause would be ended after the end of the year.\u201dYou need to understand, if you stop paying that money to insurers, that means we can\u2019t make any more payments to Medicare hospitaes, and that means hundreds of millions of dollars that will be lost,\u201d Reid said in a statement.\u201cI think the public understands that if we cancel that insurance contract that will cost money, which we have done in the past, but it will mean that they will begin paying out uncompensated care.\u201dWhite House officials told reporters on Wednesday that the administration would not be compelled to make premium or taxpayer subsidies a condition of Obamacare coverage contracts.A White House official said on Wednesday the Obama administration had not yet decided whether it could or could not lawfully make health insurance premiums a condition of Obamacare health coverage.\u201dIt would be up to the states whether to require premiums,\u201d said a White House official at the time.\u201dMy understanding isn\u2019t yet that they\u2019ve done it.\u201dThe White House said two months ago it would \u201cnot allow insurers to set premiums unilaterally based on their own costs, and will not allow payments to them to be conditional on premium levels that reflect those insurers\u2019 costs.\u201dIn a meeting last week with lawmakers, Obama said that the administration \u201cwill not go ahead with any payments on the condition that insurers agree to raise their health insurance premiums, including the premiums people with preexisting conditions face.\u201dDuring his visit to the state, Obama signed dozens of executive actions from his administration\u2019s

{"prompt":"Sweden will raise the minimum age at which workers can take their state pension over the coming years , a move designed to match an increase in average life spans , the major political parties","text":"Sweden will raise the minimum age at which workers can take their state pension over the coming years, a move designed to match an increase in average life spans, the major political parties said on Wednesday.\nThe Conservative Party, now ruling coalition partner, said the introduction of age-typing ( age-basing ) in state pension systems would require the introduction of work requirements for a minimum age of 64 this year.\nThe Labour Party and the Centre Party, the other coalition partners, wanted age requirements made for both women and men.\nThe introduction of such requirements was already agreed by the ruling coalition in 2003. But if the minimum age requirement is put in place at the same time as the introduction of an age-basing system, the number of women working beyond the statutory retirement age could be cut by 60,000.\nSwedish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen had said that if his government came to power in 2005 it would implement the same proposals as other European Union countries, including reforms in the pension system to make the system more sustainable.\nSwedish labour law does currently not allow workers to retire earlier. It is possible to retire at age 62 if the years of service have been made up in part-time work during your full-time working career, or be able to retire on account of illness or disability.\nThere are suggestions that the new proposal could allow all workers to retire earlier and have their pension lower, but the Social Democratic Party says the system could be modified later on.\nThe Social Democratic Party has already criticised the pension system and is expected to support the reform to make it more sustainable.\nThe retirement age should be in line with average life span, said the Social Democrat leader Jorgen L\u00f6fven at a debate on pension reforms.\nSwedish media and the public have criticised the conservative government's proposal. The labour parties, however, say the proposal to introduce age typing is only a short term solution.\nThe Conservative's proposal says that the mandatory retirement age for men could rise from the current 57 to 59 and for women it could be raised from 55 to 57. It is likely to cost about 1.5 billion crowns (about 150 million euros).\nThe labour parties and the centre said that such a proposal could have the same impact on women as the introduction of age-basing.\nThe Labour party's deputy chairman Anders Kydland also pointed to an increase in the minimum pension of women to 75 per cent of the average wage as an alternative to the proposal to introduce age requirements.\nA government draft report on the retirement age shows that the introduction of the proposed age typing would mean that all women would have to retire at least ten years earlier. There would be a cut in the number of women working past the age of 55 and an increase of women working at a lower wage. This would mean cuts in women's pensions and in social support.","token_len":590,"entropy":[8.8197,5.3136,7.5448,1.502,1.9443,3.0564,2.8389,0.1276,4.004,0.4411,4.7653,2.8061,6.5632,0.6589,6.3029,1.3247,2.9313,0.7254,1.5908,3.2652,1.0977,5.7303,0.0212,6.9933,5.259,1.364,0.1469,6.4004,4.6099,4.2924,3.0278,2.1987,8.4492,2.8934,0.559,1.4003,1.6363,1.9362,0.1562,0.163,14.6049,8.4204,0.788,2.2186,6.9022,5.5,2.3231,1.9722,0.6367,1.3928,1.5426,6.2795,0.1012,5.075,1.4759,11.1233,0.9329,6.9949,10.8228,1.0399,6.6222,6.5298,0.2634,2.1906,4.4709,1.012,2.9973,1.0304,5.714,2.3775,2.549,0.0244,7.8184,1.9188,1.4426,4.2438,2.0444,2.3737,0.2952,4.2925,8.1619,0.1369,0.5323,0.3801,1.6999,4.1952,0.1723,2.5614,0.7025,6.8302,1.2408,1.8467,2.8949,4.665,5.7492,0.2553,0.2562,6.959,3.8634,4.5838,6.7173,3.6512,4.3937,5.2715,0.1078,0.3185,1.3745,0.2222,1.4955,5.8095,0.106,4.2477,1.5295,2.5285,4.2115,4.4562,1.1535,1.0874,4.7665,0.7176,1.9299,5.4147,1.7759,3.3121,6.1403,1.2029,2.5444,0.237,4.4822,1.0212,4.9277,0.6778,0.0395,3.55,1.196,1.7751,0.1402,0.5802,1.5277,4.5569,0.0515,4.9962,0.3861,0.3752,1.9273,0.0701,1.0963,0.3163,1.3205,4.812,0.0411,2.3031,2.9546,5.7212,0.815,4.8454,6.2222,0.0132,1.8169,2.469,2.3686,1.0335,4.6452,1.5327,1.781,2.4147,0.1485,5.6293,4.1066,0.0003,2.3198,0.0067,3.8323,0.5682,0.0007,0.0,4.1512,1.588,2.0199,3.2243,4.2056,1.2523,4.5619,0.599,0.2897,1.0644,5.0107,2.0293,0.1031,4.3121,1.1872,4.157,5.2159,1.2433,5.2468,2.08,2.3235,0.8347,1.5568,1.1139,7.4985,2.9555,1.391,3.314,0.1908,3.4712,2.5246,2.9131,1.8595,0.6842,5.176,0.4744,0.195,2.7782,2.0966,0.0023,5.0961,3.8649,4.3116,9.7221,3.6866,1.4663,2.8249,0.4248,3.6112,3.9865,4.0983,4.125,1.4199,3.4872,1.5851,2.477,1.6366,1.544,2.646,2.0346,2.1153,8.0227,1.0215,0.7841,2.3413,1.948,5.1741,1.3475,3.5219,4.0652,5.3954,0.0264,0.9888,5.9381,5.5816,3.8998,1.72,0.0275,2.1428,2.9711,1.3152,2.9597,5.8934,3.3972,0.0194,1.9226,3.3054,6.3051,0.0163,2.6853,0.8753,0.7472,0.5035,0.3994,4.9311,1.1383,7.0362,0.447,1.3855,3.0223,5.564,1.4282,3.5943,5.7494,1.5191,0.7108,1.1067,2.7528,3.7091,4.4424,1.6456,1.8764,8.8709,2.4033,2.4731,1.5979,3.2796,2.4827,0.4774,4.8468,1.6924,4.5186,2.0903,1.167,4.418,5.9211,2.7839,0.9139,0.3187,1.4138,1.5759,1.2026,0.3722,2.4034,3.7171,5.775,0.385,6.69,0.9145,2.7291,4.1565,3.5845,0.0164,3.2606,1.0849,4.8576,4.9389,2.5066,0.5353,0.7343,0.6812,0.5332,0.4689,1.4561,6.586,0.2519,4.241,0.5055,5.3103,1.6856,0.0025,5.183,0.3483,2.1189,1.153,2.6725,2.1283,1.0709,2.2653,2.6229,4.6464,3.0898,4.399,4.5816,1.7375,0.4651,0.2336,4.4708,0.4582,3.9868,1.1031,5.0154,2.2832,2.1595,0.4444,3.1005,1.388,0.0045,4.6179,3.9885,2.4153,3.0286,1.6965,3.6983,0.2706,6.6258,1.9312,1.7699,2.2347,1.9686,2.6481,7.2919,6.5516,2.9205,2.36,0.0038,1.9676,1.1394,2.0324,4.4116,1.944,0.4822,9.8871,2.2226,4.0361,2.0582,5.0259,3.7109,1.1314,1.5809,0.4092,1.6449,6.0737,6.5105,1.8036,5.0556,1.0854,2.2163,5.679,2.1685,0.0452,2.1828,2.6157,4.9644,3.1513,1.1865,3.5704,0.73,5.5085,0.565,3.1312,2.8791,3.118,0.023,2.1992,0.9068,1.1954,1.5758,1.4712,3.2511,0.0556,3.349,0.3648,3.8702,2.3614,3.7924,1.0385,4.6858,1.9248,3.385,0.4659,0.8594,0.7682,4.8209,0.0131,2.0371,0.5559,7.5518,0.6349,0.578,2.1894,0.4894,1.3261,5.0037,0.4392,3.6559,0.4879,3.2962,6.5485,1.4553,5.3626,0.8596,3.0406,2.6811,3.0776,2.9807,2.534,1.5799,1.0244,2.5595,0.6923,1.4112,2.1691,0.0181,1.0253,0.3573,0.6603,0.027,0.9715,0.4689,1.6067,4.0867,2.2608,2.8687,4.02,3.8652,5.3003,3.8883,8.7982,6.9084,4.5728,3.9146,1.869,3.7869,2.5776,0.0936,0.7551,1.5856,3.9444,5.0863,2.7011,2.8027,4.7049,4.3292,0.0091,1.8789,0.6614,3.4054,4.1765,4.2052,1.6937,2.7235,0.6527,0.8534,4.5889,1.4224,1.0029,0.301,4.8583,0.7579,0.3622,4.2053,3.5008,6.9658,4.0621,1.2647,0.7707,4.7695,0.331,5.7498,0.1804,1.5828,5.401,0.0198,2.6313,5.2172,1.071,5.9075,1.8434,3.596,1.0039,4.4922,1.2872,1.3203,1.2123,0.4442,2.6149,1.1506,2.6126,5.9066,0.0312,0.7712,2.2582,5.9878,1.2583,0.8034,1.8086,3.9625,0.862,0.5423,1.5163,0.0161,0.6131,1.0378,4.0799,0.989,0.6485,0.066,3.0931,2.657,3.1174,0.2272,2.1609,2.6445,0.7343,3.6483,2.8916,2.0633,2.3321,1.0194,5.3541,0.6338,2.237,7.7653,0.7965,3.0158,0.6692,3.2251,1.9589,3.9795,3.7791,4.6765,1.4118]}
{"prompt":"The Trump administration , in line with its tough immigration policy , is keeping red tape in place that could make it harder for immigrants in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey to find jobs with","text":"The Trump administration, in line with its tough immigration policy, is keeping red tape in place that could make it harder for immigrants in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey to find jobs with potential employers.\nThe president recently signed an order that will force people moving here from hurricane-attacked Texas to get a work permit before being hired. The Trump administration earlier this month moved to expand red tape for potential employers who want to hire immigrants in the aftermath of the storm, saying they can now hire immigrants up to 12 months after they apply, regardless of when they came to the U.S. They had previously been restricted to hiring immigrants up to two years after applying.\nThe move came in the wake of a federal judge blocking the Trump administration\u2019s proposed work permit rule from taking effect. More than 6,000 illegal immigrants have applied after the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey to Texas to replace temporary work permits (TWPs) lost as the damage from the hurricane intensified in 2017, according to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \u201cOur decision protects the interests of both private businesses and the immigrants who are displaced by Hurricane Harvey and allows them to move forward and start working,\u201d said United States District Judge James Robart for the Northern District of Texas. The decision followed a lower court\u2019s ruling last week that Trump\u2019s TWP rule, which would have made it much tougher for workers to get temporary legal status, could not go ahead.\nWhile a work permit is a legal license to work in the U.S., a work authorization, also known as a work visa, grants a person the ability to legally enter the U.S. to work. The work authorization can give the newly hired immigrant a green card in 12 months if they want to get a green card in the U.S. If the job is found the sponsor must ask for permission to hire the immigrant, and the new law will make the process easier to do.\nOn April 19, Trump said he wanted TWPs to be extended indefinitely and was planning to put a work permit on the back burner. Trump\u2019s order, however, would not make it easier for existing permits, but was meant to protect the legal work visa holders when a TWP gets canceled. However, the order\u2019s interpretation by federal courts has been that the new regulations would only apply to new applicants for work visas.\nThe Department of Labor has said that companies that hire people who have TWPs can still hire them immediately, and they shouldn\u2019t worry. \u201cThere are certainly no restrictions on employers who already have individuals who have valid TWPs,\u201d said Peter Leeson, a spokesman for the Department of Labor, in an email.\nIt also said it would extend current temporary immigration laws to allow work authorization for new applicants for a certain amount of time after they applied for a visa or TWP.","token_len":590,"entropy":[7.6977,0.9163,3.5503,2.7341,6.0125,0.012,1.2582,7.5988,4.381,1.7199,0.3254,1.5553,5.7349,9.159,0.3756,1.9622,0.3057,2.8938,1.7709,2.6336,0.3817,0.8307,0.1993,2.8314,3.8267,0.2518,11.6853,0.0372,3.4737,0.564,0.7168,3.523,1.0934,6.2706,6.4682,1.6571,0.582,0.4134,15.53,3.2579,4.5945,2.5695,1.2532,3.6942,1.9772,2.7285,3.805,4.8034,6.301,3.7856,1.4516,7.4963,0.0896,9.2641,2.0494,4.0119,0.8556,3.1538,1.6699,3.8042,0.1544,3.135,3.7721,4.5019,0.8622,2.0332,3.9592,0.1166,7.0379,0.1749,0.6734,5.2275,0.6244,3.4363,8.0227,0.0286,2.1936,6.4009,0.8678,2.5827,2.0579,0.1221,0.4025,1.6076,2.6839,0.8581,1.4483,0.009,1.8669,1.0697,1.6082,3.891,2.4876,2.649,3.5989,3.6727,3.2557,5.9448,0.0625,4.4118,0.8781,0.7105,1.9016,4.1163,3.2073,4.2462,0.008,4.593,0.4149,4.2367,1.0293,0.0907,0.6033,0.0005,0.0013,0.0481,4.0752,5.565,2.0331,1.2683,5.2026,0.8755,3.0421,2.3469,2.2093,0.0064,2.9826,0.1714,0.3545,4.0135,0.5604,0.2393,3.0001,3.5092,3.4638,2.7555,2.0194,0.2966,0.0036,1.6084,2.8391,0.7564,6.1334,0.8748,2.1674,0.0844,16.1334,8.0538,3.9204,4.6268,7.4773,0.8411,4.834,1.5967,1.1193,0.0047,1.3496,6.4826,0.2006,4.2023,0.4422,0.471,4.8908,0.2232,1.6659,0.8133,6.3614,1.7352,9.7664,2.5006,0.2626,0.6805,0.0644,3.8028,2.8674,4.1826,6.9857,3.7204,1.6529,0.0626,6.2157,6.5625,2.6385,0.6844,5.648,4.4019,1.7154,4.6729,2.0911,0.7491,2.7289,2.7694,3.1817,6.2583,2.2977,0.8272,0.0019,0.5863,2.2856,0.0005,0.0042,0.0026,3.5078,0.0464,0.0085,0.0007,1.1267,0.0006,0.422,8.7434,5.7665,11.201,5.0134,7.0643,2.2352,4.6593,0.0304,4.8273,5.483,2.633,0.0768,1.5457,5.4892,0.8823,1.7056,2.052,1.2925,2.7073,0.0159,1.9522,5.5936,1.812,0.1667,3.71,3.2349,3.3276,4.044,4.1002,3.8063,8.2608,7.6752,3.6066,7.249,0.8232,3.1338,0.0557,2.5651,0.0834,0.0015,6.4134,0.0567,3.1857,0.0058,0.0218,0.0667,0.4712,3.0998,3.7753,5.7903,0.7676,4.8538,0.297,11.7054,1.4733,0.3284,1.0392,2.7628,1.3365,0.5331,5.3511,5.3787,0.2394,0.0061,6.5688,0.1143,0.759,3.8521,0.4708,2.3058,0.6847,3.9065,0.3532,3.9644,2.5669,0.2588,4.3541,0.7628,2.0118,3.4026,4.465,0.7883,0.9173,2.4003,1.1349,3.04,4.4616,0.4588,0.4189,4.8518,4.1891,3.6845,0.0302,1.2934,1.6636,3.0028,7.5326,0.38,0.7415,0.6885,0.3176,0.3706,0.0006,0.0013,0.1403,2.8449,1.3382,4.4476,4.3318,4.0643,0.2132,0.0166,0.3604,1.2721,2.6176,0.1897,6.147,1.6127,2.2163,2.0589,2.6421,0.0073,4.1709,2.407,0.1699,0.4929,0.0004,0.0014,0.19,3.3822,0.4048,2.2336,1.8011,1.8809,0.3084,2.9774,4.809,2.2037,8.2985,2.0849,1.853,1.3852,2.4655,0.2052,4.1881,8.7984,0.3092,2.7937,0.644,5.3191,0.1398,3.8746,0.8109,3.0051,0.0547,1.6412,1.5015,2.5059,0.0006,0.0021,0.5388,3.8569,1.3872,5.4282,1.1239,5.6448,7.0043,8.8065,3.0996,5.6176,1.0051,2.7594,1.5692,3.6164,0.9925,1.5145,1.8067,2.0783,1.4653,3.5203,6.5668,2.6398,3.5283,3.4097,3.6125,2.837,3.7786,3.8667,0.6688,0.755,5.0447,4.5119,3.2293,0.14,2.9329,4.0999,1.3038,2.7377,6.1741,1.1478,0.5226,0.5766,4.3105,4.7887,3.1618,4.7498,4.3891,0.3071,4.0278,2.3031,4.1761,0.2269,0.509,0.5264,4.8428,0.889,1.3873,3.7739,4.9177,0.0324,0.0041,2.6758,3.1081,1.6606,0.0021,2.7018,1.9061,3.4476,0.6602,1.9275,0.5433,5.4197,6.3271,3.224,4.6412,5.0052,3.9627,0.085,3.6592,1.5919,5.0044,4.2484,4.2419,0.8937,5.8328,4.0645,4.423,0.018,5.9407,3.6653,0.6159,5.1199,0.0051,1.4077,2.268,6.0965,0.0953,0.0235,6.5924,6.59,4.6118,2.2216,2.4036,2.2251,4.3245,1.5251,3.058,4.6178,1.1962,2.4417,1.1764,0.1851,3.3653,2.5172,3.6845,1.7331,2.3761,1.3883,0.8848,1.7791,3.5203,0.0188,3.1968,2.0528,1.8373,1.1237,6.6425,1.6213,2.3802,3.032,2.3791,1.5714,3.6195,0.2869,2.8853,2.767,2.2653,0.7058,6.3443,1.9342,2.1431,3.4803,7.017,1.241,0.3105,0.0596,3.9142,2.7709,5.7557,0.1935,4.5433,1.4081,6.1034,4.7569,3.3321,0.3904,3.3861,1.3362,6.0655,0.7067,7.9354,1.5745,1.4791,7.0723,2.5181,0.5489,1.9534,2.9331,1.899,0.5141,5.816,6.7202,5.6701,0.1671,1.3866,2.5183,0.0506,0.2716,1.1042,0.0304,0.0856,2.8244,1.8372,0.6146,0.3639,0.402,0.9967,4.8864,3.3492,3.8927,2.7862,1.1154,6.2663,6.6818,4.9435,6.3561,3.8997,1.0668,4.9369,4.4896,2.1246,3.2174,2.8258,2.3538,3.051,3.5052,4.4971,2.0588,0.0496,0.0346,2.8373,1.3656,5.8163,1.1076,0.9303,3.5388,3.448,7.8368,0.0197,0.4837]}
{"prompt":"Republican Senator Richard Burr , the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said on Wednesday that Facebook ads bought by Russia-linked entities targeted more than just Michigan and Wisconsin , the two states listed","text":"Republican Senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that Facebook ads bought by Russia-linked entities targeted more than just Michigan and Wisconsin, the two states listed in the most recent report from the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) on Russian election interference. \u201cI believe that these ads have targeted other elections,\u201d said Burr.\nIn August 2018, the RNC accused Facebook of failing to take necessary action to curb the use of its platform by foreign propaganda. On Tuesday, the group released a report on the efforts of its intelligence unit, the Republican National Intelligence ( RIN ) unit, to determine if ads from Facebook were used to influence the 2016 presidential election.\nAccording to the RNC, the ads used the \u201camplification technology\u201d of Facebook to be able to achieve a high reach on Twitter.\nThe report suggests that political actors from Russia could influence elections in other countries using the \u201camplification technology\u201d offered on Facebook. In August 2018, the group\u2019s new report, which was published by CNN, criticized Facebook for failing to adequately prevent the targeting of users in the United States because it would not \u201cuse appropriate technology that would detect suspicious foreign actors and then block them. \u201d\nBurr\u2019s testimony highlighted that there are other countries that might be impacted by the use of \u201camplification technology\u201d on the social network.\nHe was asked whether Facebook was able to determine \u201cpolitical actors in other countries\u201d and whether foreign actors in other countries have used its \u201camplification technology \u201d to influence elections there.\nIn an interview on TODAY on Wednesday, Burr said, \u201cI think I would agree with you that anytime you have foreign influence in foreign elections, you put your finger on Russia, and I think we all agree. You know, I think we\u2019re fairly assured that Putin, or Russians, or whoever, are responsible for that. \u201c\nHe added, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that this is a Russian campaign at this point to take advantage of that amplification mechanism and use it on American elections. \u201c\nBurr said that he believes that the Russians used the same amplification technology in order to be able to influence the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\nCNN did not question Burr\u2019s comments about whether the ads are used to influence the results of elections in other countries. The group did not directly answer its question.\n\u201cThe RNC can see no evidence of this, but it should be noted that amplification technology is simply one tool used by foreign actors in trying to influence elections worldwide, \u201csaid CNN.\nTwitter has also not made comments on the RNC report at this time. Twitter said last week that it is working with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to investigate whether Russian election interference occurred during the 2016 presidential election.","token_len":591,"entropy":[8.6604,4.4514,1.7696,1.5188,2.4465,1.7409,0.0134,0.018,0.4797,0.4453,0.0107,0.2235,1.4003,2.4155,2.1662,0.4406,8.4953,6.5732,5.8984,0.5172,3.3584,3.364,0.2601,2.7184,5.5061,5.0644,0.2116,6.2484,9.6922,1.801,2.1611,1.8819,4.0819,1.2591,1.599,8.1943,1.1596,0.5796,5.9579,0.3133,2.0748,4.3216,0.2062,6.0217,0.6163,0.0028,3.308,9.6081,1.8506,2.4671,2.0971,2.7419,0.5765,0.337,11.4633,6.6262,7.8538,3.1363,1.0163,3.3494,0.9312,3.0665,3.3604,4.3725,5.548,1.9931,13.0842,7.9497,3.8821,0.1346,1.0036,1.3508,12.381,5.1226,7.37,0.1121,1.467,1.4407,5.6718,1.0425,0.1616,5.1861,0.0289,4.7278,4.3048,2.3033,0.7223,3.7952,1.9663,4.3,0.0171,2.1723,2.0905,1.8266,3.43,5.0084,1.6745,4.2409,2.7068,0.0746,1.1626,4.1955,2.9433,0.3989,2.0922,2.2812,1.4347,6.2883,0.5172,3.0131,5.7163,5.1628,1.251,1.5433,6.4836,0.5825,6.077,7.5331,1.6444,0.7422,1.0118,5.6334,0.5794,1.1333,5.1512,2.0724,4.7632,3.8861,3.2512,1.7945,2.9194,1.1266,1.3456,0.8658,1.3033,1.1863,0.165,0.3423,0.8279,3.5003,0.0041,0.558,2.4004,2.0086,1.359,4.4362,3.9383,3.3179,12.2258,3.0571,10.0867,1.5292,2.328,4.383,1.3607,1.5405,2.6782,1.9223,1.2449,6.646,1.2344,0.0175,7.1256,2.0879,4.5971,9.4972,3.4161,4.3253,2.1629,1.5085,1.832,1.9534,5.5143,0.1947,6.4516,4.7729,4.4767,1.4398,4.4713,3.6716,4.2205,1.294,1.8197,1.0116,3.813,1.8434,3.7339,0.0741,1.8576,0.0007,0.0249,0.1375,0.468,0.0568,8.1542,4.3518,0.5836,0.6566,3.5558,3.2181,1.4249,0.0516,0.8265,4.1537,13.2578,8.3666,3.6305,6.6201,2.6938,3.4618,3.3427,1.3998,1.9114,1.814,4.7651,1.1142,5.4183,0.8803,0.3462,1.648,0.0163,4.6579,4.1677,1.8083,5.6476,0.0947,5.9813,1.3077,2.148,0.9416,0.0397,6.1169,2.2872,5.112,2.4572,13.326,0.2545,4.8964,6.5633,3.5045,4.9226,1.4573,3.7941,5.6437,7.0733,3.8936,2.7976,4.8475,5.3813,1.562,1.0411,3.3492,3.7524,0.8547,6.2835,0.0008,3.508,2.6983,2.5419,4.2571,6.2329,1.5322,4.1941,1.6323,3.2696,2.5167,1.1492,4.691,0.9478,4.8085,0.3445,1.2082,2.6187,0.015,4.4566,0.0201,0.1399,0.0001,0.029,0.5072,2.3499,0.1116,3.0512,2.438,1.8978,0.6587,0.6156,1.2166,3.0931,4.6321,1.2078,1.7164,1.1574,2.674,3.1043,0.0226,4.2442,6.7551,0.1251,9.9506,0.2373,4.1254,1.0247,0.0766,2.2957,1.2221,2.9867,1.8499,6.9782,0.4162,4.2856,1.0819,0.0951,4.2936,2.5305,4.023,2.9357,0.0334,0.2308,0.0001,0.005,0.051,3.0653,0.5861,0.7505,1.2243,0.8229,5.6783,0.2687,0.5341,3.2396,3.0845,0.4685,1.7363,9.1972,3.7373,0.8207,0.1523,1.422,0.9993,2.3428,0.8731,0.6588,1.4975,1.1922,5.3257,2.7919,2.603,0.7593,1.2134,1.4777,10.545,1.1178,1.7546,4.6708,3.9708,2.4554,4.6868,2.6414,0.8349,1.5233,6.3781,2.3851,3.2518,0.5183,3.6421,1.9456,1.3137,3.4571,0.4638,2.856,3.3571,1.2784,3.1491,4.4236,2.4129,0.377,1.6521,0.749,1.672,11.3201,5.8838,2.8827,7.2611,6.6171,0.6543,5.2432,3.3518,3.7569,7.0848,0.713,1.0541,2.3162,1.2565,4.5272,3.2752,0.2079,2.1515,0.8014,2.2979,1.1458,1.9431,2.1571,1.6405,0.9143,0.164,0.0833,3.6352,1.1757,2.3965,1.5785,1.9164,0.0225,0.4381,1.4658,3.9819,0.7899,1.5968,3.9813,3.3263,4.6238,3.7481,0.2379,4.6815,3.9172,1.6242,0.0252,3.1496,9.7914,4.6334,3.2774,3.0896,0.7601,3.2811,4.2773,0.982,0.6712,1.3454,0.2523,0.3096,2.0804,0.0052,2.5525,1.0856,1.9062,1.9194,0.5583,1.7472,3.2282,3.4578,1.5016,3.0745,2.3482,1.7976,2.7308,4.2825,0.0161,5.6121,0.0403,0.011,1.4209,1.0237,4.935,2.5144,2.3653,1.1193,0.0162,1.9347,1.3078,0.5306,0.5695,6.5943,5.0729,0.0875,6.0569,1.8651,1.6125,0.1417,0.0497,3.1941,2.7149,1.5941,1.5563,5.101,4.1852,2.6448,1.1569,0.3212,1.4491,5.0532,0.1776,2.4811,0.5194,0.3164,0.0667,0.5671,3.2508,3.8348,2.2049,1.253,4.8357,2.8356,5.238,1.5813,2.2845,0.3714,4.2674,1.341,2.8449,3.0591,7.1377,6.2468,5.9414,0.7198,1.4939,3.6354,2.4054,2.6062,1.8469,3.8502,1.7906,2.2527,0.1208,12.1739,0.9262,1.0966,8.3687,4.3179,3.1365,1.5819,0.861,2.2764,0.376,2.9436,6.2362,0.0101,0.7069,0.7605,5.4316,2.0959,2.9413,0.3218,3.5758,5.1178,1.0528,0.42,5.9296,2.441,2.897,3.6205,4.1544,5.2131,0.5979,0.6358,4.9999,1.629,6.418,0.5421,0.0951,0.2729,3.547,3.0864,4.1104,0.757,0.3988,0.3206,2.357,2.0472,0.9791,0.6668,5.8784,0.0192,0.5749,0.2606,0.0635,0.0835,0.0002,1.1953,2.2584,1.6459,2.1305,2.7685,0.383,5.3894,3.8451,0.2703,0.5649,0.9452,0.4696,0.4175]}
{"prompt":"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was unaware of any plans to oust him when he spoke to Senator Bob Corker on Thursday , Corker said . \u201c He \u2019 s conducting business , as","text":"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was unaware of any plans to oust him when he spoke to Senator Bob Corker on Thursday, Corker said. \u201c He \u2019 s conducting business, as always, and he \u2019 s a strong chief of staff, \u201d Corker said.\nIn addition to being uninformed about any plans to oust the ambassador, the State Department also appeared to try and dismiss President Trump\u2019s criticism over the weekend of Tillerson after announcing it would move from D.C. to Florida, and not because a White House official was telling him to, according to U.S. officials.\nHe told the reporters that he was speaking on the subject, not after their request, but he stopped short of saying it was because he was told to do so.\nThe decision to move the State Department came even after the announcement that the Trump administration was planning to move the State Department\u2019s headquarters out of D.C., a move that is seen by some as a significant disruption to the country\u2019s diplomatic operation.\nTillerson said the move would be made effective in January and would lead to a reduced presence of the nation\u2019s chief diplomat in D.C.\nTillerson told reporters Wednesday he told his team that his next destination should be \u201cin Florida,\u201d not after a reporter asked him what he meant.\nU.S. officials told CNN that Tillerson told the senators and congressional aides in a meeting Tuesday afternoon that his new position would involve less travel and less contact with other foreign leaders.\nThe White House said its officials decided to move the State Department\u2019s headquarters because the White House doesn\u2019t have a formal office at the U.N. headquarters in the city, and Trump\u2019s staffers would be required to live in D.C. They said this wouldn\u2019t have an impact on the diplomatic operation.\nOn Friday afternoon, the U.S. State Department issued a rare statement on the decision to move its headquarters out of D.C.,\n\u201d The State Department is proud of the service it has provided to our nation. Moving its headquarters and its workforce from the national capital of the United States enhances our ability to continue delivering our mission to advance our national interests around the world, in a way that benefits our country. With that in mind, we will make what the best interests of the State Department require our new home location. We will have flexibility in the choice of location.\n\u201cAs the State Department has never been based within the Department of State Building, we will continue to operate under a single mission, and we will have the capacity to respond to any external events occurring throughout the United States.\n\u201cThe State Department will conduct its business from a modern, comfortable office environment. A central, modern office building is important for our mission to deliver a quality response to the nation.","token_len":591,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,4.0045,7.0486,0.3772,2.5856,5.6819,0.468,6.9389,2.8216,4.408,0.4918,4.5872,0.9957,7.4315,3.1471,0.0273,2.7295,2.578,1.5994,4.5828,0.5324,0.7583,13.8413,7.4224,5.5971,10.5858,8.5411,8.72,9.7726,3.4527,5.1196,3.709,6.6378,0.7813,2.0139,1.9466,1.3673,0.2093,2.0396,3.9942,4.3005,8.4833,0.9874,0.0286,1.7548,3.873,6.0019,6.3327,0.5688,0.2956,1.6743,15.2515,3.3837,0.9147,4.0616,10.6533,0.0506,0.7967,3.0084,2.158,0.8757,0.6035,4.2477,4.7164,0.3296,2.3341,3.9208,0.0127,3.0716,5.3713,0.6124,6.1091,2.3944,5.3097,5.703,0.6427,5.2811,3.0028,0.2443,3.8502,4.8808,1.3314,5.0824,0.3811,3.2603,7.1479,7.2394,4.6135,0.8797,4.6891,4.4892,7.8371,0.4213,0.003,0.1022,0.1079,4.8284,2.124,3.5379,4.6887,5.8177,5.4153,4.1835,0.0005,1.1767,1.5104,5.0482,0.3819,1.2669,1.6422,3.7873,0.0025,4.9661,0.0018,0.0071,0.0033,0.458,0.7493,0.3636,6.3767,3.3938,1.8307,4.0888,1.1531,1.5712,1.7313,4.6302,2.807,1.6762,4.1846,2.7918,3.3955,6.0354,7.8132,6.874,2.3957,0.9421,6.3518,7.2347,0.229,0.0295,1.3462,2.4133,1.1977,2.884,1.7381,1.1477,4.0656,2.3073,2.5809,0.1639,0.8335,0.4065,2.2093,3.6996,0.7195,1.1933,1.8518,3.4772,0.0217,6.2407,5.8466,2.2545,1.7682,5.7061,1.4024,1.774,2.6206,0.4184,1.2774,3.9698,0.1714,2.9588,0.9589,1.5348,0.0167,9.2471,0.5397,0.0341,1.9623,2.8303,0.0279,1.951,0.0005,0.0038,1.8939,2.9781,0.3091,0.4499,3.6451,3.2208,1.923,0.5326,0.5021,1.0018,4.9767,6.1244,0.5481,0.8244,4.7402,2.1049,0.0964,0.0312,1.7561,4.803,0.4882,0.4805,3.3178,0.006,0.0,2.2479,2.191,1.1167,1.5587,1.4184,2.6138,5.8894,3.2373,3.8938,2.3091,1.7499,5.8554,0.1543,1.5398,7.2017,3.9512,1.8061,1.0088,6.5042,3.1544,0.0412,0.0079,6.1567,1.2651,1.1456,2.2507,0.0004,0.0036,0.5123,0.9897,3.3287,0.0267,0.0002,3.1768,0.9029,3.5628,2.539,5.128,2.4713,3.6881,1.2462,3.1362,6.3302,5.4048,4.0703,0.1208,10.5234,2.1732,4.7711,1.5084,1.3912,4.3537,3.7404,3.7456,6.6896,3.0468,7.521,0.7005,0.657,2.7907,0.8806,2.5567,1.4398,0.3944,6.1153,0.0019,0.003,0.0055,1.6819,2.9421,1.9161,0.7259,1.134,2.3363,1.3854,4.941,3.586,5.816,2.948,2.6328,3.2539,1.7315,3.6703,2.8093,0.2653,2.8115,3.8006,2.5914,0.9309,4.1104,6.4826,1.8672,1.5229,2.1797,6.3774,0.1515,4.3571,1.9593,1.4172,0.7831,0.5723,2.0511,3.1577,0.0014,2.2197,4.8809,3.6902,5.5451,0.6839,0.9796,0.3265,0.7267,0.0037,4.4587,0.0308,0.0062,0.5366,4.5363,2.2306,3.8619,0.0012,5.8048,1.2509,0.457,0.4456,2.327,1.8868,3.6438,3.4074,3.8494,0.4844,3.1654,0.0012,4.7854,0.1661,1.295,0.6595,3.1836,2.6131,1.8926,1.3666,5.5484,3.213,0.0156,0.0049,7.4919,3.6887,1.7479,3.7934,0.0359,4.6095,0.5699,2.4933,0.0003,0.0024,0.2319,5.0954,1.4256,5.1851,5.4106,1.0089,0.1491,0.107,2.1098,3.7567,0.271,0.1731,1.1361,3.4008,2.7039,0.6536,0.1842,3.7511,2.8804,3.7402,0.067,1.5955,3.5317,0.0008,0.2231,0.0065,1.748,0.0106,2.8555,0.2217,7.0516,0.8142,3.0357,1.1121,2.7161,0.8724,0.2525,2.1624,0.9525,2.2171,0.0609,0.7095,0.0004,0.0027,1.1267,7.6508,1.453,2.2929,3.1245,1.769,0.0179,2.657,4.6909,1.2626,1.152,4.9215,1.842,0.4294,1.8933,0.5843,1.6984,1.1045,2.0364,8.4798,3.0583,0.4546,4.5049,2.9545,6.36,1.8894,1.8905,5.5347,0.3163,3.0786,2.448,0.4627,0.007,13.3873,0.813,1.9674,0.0157,3.3736,3.7232,3.1682,2.3017,1.3396,6.2565,2.8138,1.7205,0.928,5.1989,0.0027,0.1237,1.6812,4.7417,1.8607,1.0789,0.0975,4.3921,1.9761,2.8569,2.1637,6.4229,2.5718,0.806,0.0026,0.0363,0.7757,2.6383,3.9481,8.3067,4.8837,6.2385,4.3429,0.0108,0.9086,2.9748,0.2463,4.4661,4.1675,5.6183,4.4745,6.2189,1.3407,2.0614,1.3247,4.4846,6.1181,1.487,2.3024,5.0471,0.2624,2.9038,2.1401,1.1836,0.8698,3.612,8.0298,2.4673,1.4747,0.0183,3.2641,6.4625,1.4396,5.7804,4.3423,0.6579,5.1821,0.0801,0.1326,7.496,0.548,1.0303,1.4621,1.1551,0.159,2.716,3.2651,2.257,3.2901,3.9288,1.7809,1.7197,1.2339,0.3415,3.8124,1.6817,3.8333,0.3383,4.6198,0.3569,1.2662,6.2412,4.2215,6.2118,4.6418,0.2758,2.3471,0.0121,0.7503,1.1371,1.0084,1.4297,2.1342,1.3285,0.0164,1.8431,6.4134,1.4529,2.1829,4.837,2.6078,6.574,1.2368,6.0331,2.7289,4.9661,1.9287,4.8548,5.6633,3.9466,2.3729,0.6307,2.6371,1.2845,4.5507,1.4132,1.5694,1.815,2.3676,3.9383,2.6317,4.2969,6.2454,0.5335,1.9477,3.7833,2.2776]}
{"prompt":"France and the United States are determined to vigorously raise pressure on Iran over its ballistic missile program , including possibly through sanctions , Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said during a visit to Washington","text":"France and the United States are determined to vigorously raise pressure on Iran over its ballistic missile program, including possibly through sanctions, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said during a visit to Washington.\nIran said Saturday it had completed enriching uranium to 20.5 per cent at the Fordow power plant.\nThe move follows a report saying Iran had enriched one or two percent in a clandestine facility at Natanz.\nIf the U.S. does impose an embargo on Iran, we will make it clear that we intend to make preparations for the best possible impact of this measure on the Iranian economy and on the flow of international trade and investment in Iran.\nPresident Barack Obama was elected two years ago on a vision of greater engagement with Iran, building on decades of stalled U.S.-backed efforts to get Tehran to abandon its nuclear weapons activity and to ease global concerns about Iran's nuclear program.\nHowever, Mr. Obama quickly walked back that commitment.\nIn November of last year, he said the U.S. should be prepared to take more sanctions against Iran in response to Iran's recent nuclear violations of the nuclear deal.\nSince then, the U.S. has been preparing for a possible response to this latest breach.\nAs for whether the U.S. is preparing for a direct confrontation, Mr. Obama has said the U.S. will respond as needed, if necessary, if the Islamic Republic of Iran pursues the advancement of its ballistic missile program.\nBut he said that in the meantime, we need to be prepared to engage in the process of making the message across to Iran.\nIran has long warned the U.S. not to interfere with its nuclear program, saying its program is purely peaceful.\nBut there has been growing frustration among the international community that Iran has not heeded calls for it to halt its nuclear activity.\nThe Organization of the Islamic Cooperation and the European Union have said that they believe Tehran has moved closer to acquiring a nuclear weapon, as has the U.S. intelligence community.\nTehama has always played a game of wiggles at times regarding the seriousness of the Iran program.\nIt has shown tremendous restraint and has said that what we do is very much in line with the international agreements and with the law.\nAnd our cooperation with the IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) since the beginning of this program, in many areas, was very close to what the IAEA would expect, and what the inspectors would find in their visits to Iran.\nBut they have said that the Iran program is so advanced that its development of weapons capabilities is not a long shot.\nWe have very high confidence that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon, but we have to be prepared and ready if they are unwilling to listen.\nBut the intelligence community has told me that nothing has happened, that they have not detected any activity.","token_len":591,"entropy":[3.288,2.1983,2.1662,0.3711,3.2146,6.0441,0.0992,8.596,8.0288,6.1996,0.1149,2.3644,3.0783,0.2877,2.9551,0.1776,0.4966,1.4287,3.1061,7.5388,4.8847,2.712,1.8762,8.3846,0.1804,7.3053,0.134,0.5965,0.0003,0.0258,0.0039,0.0,0.6297,4.5435,0.389,0.8202,0.0523,2.4561,1.4108,0.2723,23.6058,4.5564,4.3286,0.46,1.5747,4.8425,8.2323,0.0027,0.4568,2.2123,4.6876,5.3632,1.0178,3.7007,0.0184,4.0056,2.0134,6.6631,0.7433,7.4032,0.0815,3.3033,0.789,8.1234,3.585,3.4415,1.1228,3.5083,5.9555,1.7829,1.1775,3.4717,5.7762,6.1938,1.2889,3.4517,3.7278,1.8953,6.6136,2.2775,1.5117,4.8813,0.001,2.2023,0.4275,6.032,1.8284,3.9158,0.0006,0.1546,0.041,3.1662,5.9519,4.291,2.4356,0.4712,0.6432,0.7802,6.9381,1.0411,4.2755,1.7259,2.0419,1.0937,1.4556,4.6154,0.1588,3.8086,7.5754,1.2547,2.4574,5.7904,1.4296,5.0811,3.81,1.9444,5.7327,1.3226,1.3568,2.3891,1.4866,1.6812,1.9786,0.9819,7.9107,0.0604,3.2108,1.1239,1.886,1.0956,2.9043,2.2458,1.7614,1.249,6.5226,1.1306,0.0044,4.5289,5.2382,6.4234,0.5262,0.0266,2.6398,0.5312,8.6277,0.3728,5.9134,4.2965,0.895,1.093,1.5308,6.7063,0.8021,4.6063,0.0242,7.4466,3.6882,0.0004,0.0475,0.8703,4.6023,1.035,0.4977,4.0104,1.3543,0.1894,2.793,0.6378,0.209,2.9616,9.0493,2.2617,2.7688,5.2864,7.2147,5.0739,0.6933,2.7626,0.0941,0.5229,0.2419,0.0947,0.293,4.4614,0.0383,4.2868,0.0382,0.2564,6.2586,6.7044,0.2533,2.3745,3.4397,1.9802,0.4847,3.1006,5.1428,4.8702,0.4763,0.0015,0.1412,1.7162,1.5492,2.3104,0.9723,0.0006,0.0165,0.0428,2.0311,3.3575,2.2954,0.1957,3.0608,3.4523,4.5997,1.9343,0.2263,3.3149,1.7855,0.0743,3.0357,0.0434,4.2761,1.7486,6.0067,6.1762,1.3954,1.9801,1.2104,0.9372,0.4672,4.6438,0.1818,0.0883,1.3733,1.3421,0.0006,0.0094,0.0957,0.3199,2.1659,5.2356,1.1572,1.7691,2.2104,4.687,1.6543,5.0827,2.7261,5.2808,2.1969,0.64,5.1562,3.6842,3.1841,1.354,0.8337,0.0006,0.0038,0.0304,2.9319,4.7401,1.2308,1.1022,4.5118,2.631,1.6482,1.3043,0.0005,0.5773,2.3118,1.1251,2.6072,0.8551,0.0006,0.0154,0.034,2.1672,3.4975,4.2221,2.8335,1.8352,4.2713,0.939,0.9444,2.5507,2.3695,5.1788,0.1192,4.1835,0.0215,4.9875,0.0001,3.3403,7.9827,0.0149,0.7575,2.6359,0.1304,0.125,0.4415,0.3138,2.7627,2.3679,2.4097,2.4101,3.8601,0.7344,2.8569,0.3115,4.81,2.7443,0.2039,2.4188,0.7596,0.6696,3.942,1.9732,3.3399,4.3037,0.4231,4.2058,2.1367,8.6764,5.1412,5.6386,1.4228,2.3411,0.3428,3.5484,1.6952,3.7874,4.3257,3.0021,0.5938,0.0007,0.0046,0.0656,2.9998,0.0026,3.1173,1.3753,0.6226,0.6816,0.4566,1.0639,2.3711,2.5068,4.1446,0.7883,4.1968,1.6531,1.1203,0.7286,2.0023,4.5387,1.3612,0.1186,2.6386,4.7554,1.2571,2.4728,2.2184,0.011,3.309,1.6528,1.6886,2.1039,11.3852,0.0098,5.0383,1.3749,4.2136,0.0146,2.7242,0.1922,0.7098,3.0431,0.6755,0.4626,2.3523,5.4697,1.3752,1.3726,2.3993,2.3684,3.1447,1.0413,2.4586,0.0217,1.0768,2.7399,1.7159,2.3595,2.7886,2.5419,1.5934,5.5647,3.3,0.0873,4.7371,1.2789,0.3056,0.3136,1.4479,4.1953,3.1064,0.9887,1.9745,0.0004,0.1634,0.2605,4.7997,0.0731,0.3554,0.4061,6.6559,8.6648,5.9306,4.2991,8.0866,6.3658,0.8982,7.4914,0.1231,5.6044,9.158,3.8161,4.3459,8.1014,5.538,1.4827,5.6004,0.0522,0.8811,3.4294,5.9805,1.0832,0.9128,3.9738,0.9875,6.1174,6.7337,2.8524,2.8263,2.9655,4.3724,1.591,6.447,4.6228,1.8487,1.3814,4.4552,2.638,1.5435,1.0501,0.0124,1.1713,2.514,5.0862,1.9252,3.4219,0.7232,4.4124,1.3363,0.6989,4.385,5.4545,5.3912,0.7661,1.0087,6.4317,0.0709,0.0008,4.7222,8.7719,0.005,0.0003,0.0,0.704,6.6619,1.2677,1.673,0.6368,1.8451,4.0808,2.878,3.4387,4.9248,2.7388,0.7599,3.1192,1.9069,5.2183,0.53,2.455,2.3112,1.5159,0.0063,0.0002,3.0896,3.6546,2.3667,1.3373,2.4062,1.6036,5.3403,0.9873,4.7144,2.7909,2.7584,5.8518,0.7392,0.8947,0.8682,0.2914,2.4135,4.2113,1.171,2.7908,0.6185,2.4602,4.9515,0.6648,0.8861,4.9837,3.6004,0.4828,4.623,2.6133,5.5872,3.8732,4.7914,1.1171,2.0444,2.5452,5.9176,3.9627,0.6031,0.3567,3.6612,1.4433,5.0667,2.4499,0.9213,0.6702,2.2487,0.9985,1.6035,4.9754,0.5317,0.3612,0.07,1.6455,1.9834,1.0576,1.8446,2.8134,1.4703,1.1634,3.7356,2.3454,3.2298,2.7932,2.3152,7.798,0.1407,6.5671,2.1272,0.44,3.6637,2.2791,6.5894,0.5384,1.1902,3.3409,2.5678,0.4003,7.0669,1.4832,3.5475,2.9554,1.932,2.0586,1.246,0.8404,3.7425,0.6404,2.8276,2.7976]}
{"prompt":"South Korea s President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday a missile launched this week by North Korea was the most advanced of Pyongyang s arsenal , but said that the isolated state still needed to","text":"South Korea s President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday a missile launched this week by North Korea was the most advanced of Pyongyang s arsenal, but said that the isolated state still needed to be convinced to denuclearise.\nMoon Jae-in said that even though the launch had a sophisticated nuclear warhead, the missile was not advanced enough to deliver a nuclear warhead on the strategic United States mainland and that the launch furthered North Korea s nuclear capability, Kyodo news agency reported.\nPyongyang fired a medium-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, its second test of the weapon in four months.\nThe US National Security Council said that it had assessed that a ballistic missile was launched, possibly from North Korea.\nThe missile is an intermediate-range ballistic missile, or an IRBM, that is capable of reaching U.S. mainland, according to a White House statement.\nThe ballistic missile is only 3 or 3.5 kilometers in diameter, compared with the more traditional 10 meter diameter of a satellite launch vehicle, US government sources said, Kyodo news agency reported.\nHowever, those sources said, the rocket s size is not necessarily the key.\nThe missile s range is around 4,500km, roughly comparable with the North s ICBM, the 3,600km range Bae Hyun-moo, head of the Korea Institute for Northeast Asian Studies at Korea University in Seoul, told a briefing for the Korea Joondalup Bank, the BBC reported.\nIn contrast, the conventional ballistic missile, which can fly 2,000km, is smaller and lighter and is better suited for strategic use, he said.\nIn a separate interview, a US national security official said that the missile s weight could be more important than its diameter.\nA lighter missile is better for intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, testing, said the senior official who requested anonymity.\nThe test of the missile was North Korea s fourth of the month, according to sources familiar with the intelligence.\nNorth Korea has conducted military exercises in the Yellow Sea during the month, as well as nuclear test on April 4 and an intercontinental ballistic missile test on April 8, according to sources.\nThe test of the ballistic missile appears to coincide with a trip of North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho to the UN s United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, the BBC reported.\nThe UN human rights council voted unanimously last month to draft a resolution calling for the immediate release of jailed prisoners in North Korea, including those accused of spy business or defamation of their country s leaders.\nPyongyang has denounced the draft resolution as a new imperialist conspiracy designed to crush its economy.\nThe UN body also voted on May 15 to condemn North Korea for its violation of human rights, a move that Pyongyang labelled as an unfounded and ridiculous attack.\nThe North has also been accused of human rights abuses, but the regime denies such

Erdogan also said","text":"Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday the United States decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital completely disregarded a 1980 United Nations resolution regarding the status of the city. Erdogan also said that Israel didn t have the right to change the nature of the city. And in an interview with German weekly Der Spiegel, he called the move illegal and announced the Turkish government is exploring with partners including the EU and Saudi Arabia a number of international legal options to tackle it. Erdogan said that Turkey is looking to strengthen ties with Israel but that didn t mean it would agree with the transfer. Speaking of the plan to re name Jerusalem, Erdogan said that a resolution the UN General Assembly passed in 1980, didn t change the fact that Jerusalem remained an international conflict. The move had put Israel in sharp conflict with the rest of the international community, including the United States, and it could potentially lead to even worse trouble. Erdogan said the move was a violation. Erdogan was responding to questions from the weekly about his suggestion earlier this month that Turkish allies be allowed to set up their own diplomatic mission in Jerusalem, which is opposed both by the United Nations and by Israel and many Arab states. Erdogan said his idea was aimed at breaking Israel s isolation in the world and making up for the international isolation put on Turkey by Israel and the United States, while trying to avoid a diplomatic row between Ankara and Tel Aviv. Erdogan said the Jerusalem declaration had placed Israel in an awkward situation because the issue has always been a major friction between Israel and the Palestinians to the point that its existence has affected every aspect of their political existence. Erdogan said that he understood the Israeli government s decision to establish a diplomatic mission in Jerusalem as part of efforts to enhance relations with the Palestinians. He added that the embassy would be a temporary location for Turkish diplomats to work, and there was no possibility that the diplomatic relationship would take other forms. Erdogan said there was no chance, no possibility, that Turkey would support the idea of Jerusalem as Israel s capital, saying it would be an absurd, meaningless attempt on Israel s part to get away from the United Nations, and it would not have any legal basis. Jerusalem is currently under discussion on the Palestinian-Israeli track to be resolved as part of a final status agreement between the two sides. The proposal is aimed to recognize Jerusalem as the two peoples capital, based on Security Council resolution 478. Israel, which has refused to recognize the UN decision, denies the Palestinians the right to rebuild their historic holy City. Jerusalem s status remains an important issue for all Palestinians. The Arab-Israeli conflict intensified in 1967 with the occupation of most of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including Jerusalem, which Arab states consider as their holy city. Jerusalem has been the source of friction between Israel, whose inhabitants call it Jerusalem, and Palestinians who consider it as their capital.

The report was compiled by the National Health Service Digital Board and published by the British Medical Association. The committee\u2019s report found that two thirds of those surveyed thought it was difficult for people to transition back to work after working from home due to COVID-19, and nearly half worried about facing discrimination in the workplace. The report also found that most workers would like to do more work themselves at home: 67% believe it is important or vital to do as much at home as possible, and the same proportion of employees would like employers to continue to provide training and skills to help them do work from home.\nA Nigerian company has launched a smartphone with a built-in facial recognition system, which tracks how many times you open the device, and allows you to know if it\u2019s been used. The phone, referred to as the COSRX Smart Screen, uses \u2018intelligent facial recognition technology\u2019 which \u2018can quickly detect users\u2019 face, and then record activities such as reading or watching videos.\nAt just over 6.9 inches in height by 3.9 inches in width and a weight of 0.2 kilograms, the phone is also a solid-looking slab and comes in two colours \u2013 black and white.\nA number of banks are now asking customers to verify their accounts through mobile texting, sending them a code of four characters or more via their cell phone to ensure that the funds they have sent are real. One of the banks that have adopted this method is Deutsche Bank.

I\u2019ll never think of him as an ally, \u201d the president tweeted, adding that Kim was a puppet of President Obama.\nWhile North Korean President Kim has been criticizing the United States for the nuclear test by the North in February, he would also like to send a strong message to Trump by invading the South.\nThe Korean peninsula is divided between South Korea and North Korea, as in the Korean War years, with the border controlled by the U.S.\nThe two sides have fought over possession of the soil in several incidents, with the South claiming that they have won in past conflicts.\nThe US has deployed around 10,000 military personnel along the US and South Korea\u2019s border, and they have accused North Korea of launching several missile and ballistic tests, including a satellite-launched ballistic missile from November that landed over Japan\u2019s Hokkaido, and several missiles and drones from the same month that landed over the US mainland.\nMeanwhile, the Korean peninsula is also under threat from several North Korean missile tests and war games by the regime.\nAn American drone and a North Korean artillery vehicle crashed into each other in the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Wednesday, according to a senior official in the United States.\nThe two aircraft had struck the ground in South Korea\u2019s Hwanghae Province last month, according to a North Korean official.\nAn official said that the aircraft in South Korea crashed on the Hwanghae Province side of the border, and the missile was taken apart by local authorities.\nThe two planes were conducting military reconnaissance missions over the border areas. Officials were not able to say whether the American plane took off from land in North Korea.","token_len":593,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.8114,2.4025,0.4679,2.2233,1.8233,2.0986,0.6809,4.3614,2.7199,0.2506,0.0058,0.0163,0.104,1.4892,8.0442,1.5921,1.9022,2.6607,0.2246,17.8886,6.8872,13.238,5.7876,7.1769,2.9324,3.4966,1.2202,1.6057,3.1083,4.7896,5.203,6.5702,0.0878,7.3171,0.2343,0.1392,2.6018,0.3514,18.0408,4.5059,3.0774,6.3631,0.0001,1.3393,3.699,0.6296,0.2671,1.3972,0.9766,5.9349,3.3233,1.3561,0.9028,1.328,3.3621,0.9572,7.5579,4.7963,9.2899,2.9841,8.5654,1.7793,3.4552,0.9481,0.8505,1.1112,0.3922,0.2439,2.8188,3.2303,4.3811,2.8795,5.6468,2.4349,5.3436,6.0061,0.0357,1.1812,2.8487,7.411,1.9467,2.9315,0.1528,0.6151,1.9491,0.4998,2.3119,1.0997,1.9885,2.3151,0.6089,1.0429,0.9935,3.9228,8.0927,2.8732,0.1616,0.2897,0.2346,0.0051,1.723,0.2495,6.557,3.5762,1.5655,3.9542,1.0198,5.8117,2.2405,1.9478,0.001,0.3942,2.1847,2.2798,3.6698,1.7276,2.1298,1.8892,1.2317,1.4081,0.7139,0.5706,0.1509,3.4748,2.5108,6.197,3.6747,4.9159,5.5965,5.8422,4.2627,1.6877,1.6889,4.1128,2.1163,0.189,10.5318,1.545,0.5019,0.8881,2.4164,3.3068,2.1837,1.3025,1.6719,0.1307,0.9559,2.3454,1.9862,3.7201,4.5699,1.9456,1.2154,4.4211,1.9043,1.3766,1.8978,1.6351,0.5465,1.542,0.5534,0.037,1.1831,0.0929,0.0026,4.7505,2.9398,2.785,9.0379,3.8616,4.484,1.1123,1.1402,0.6884,0.6812,0.3204,7.2601,3.8118,5.5166,0.0592,3.5875,0.2912,2.2571,3.8772,1.9594,0.5256,3.9343,0.2004,0.1815,3.596,4.7468,1.1376,0.7614,3.7212,0.1075,2.5076,2.4569,4.228,1.2168,2.8821,5.8058,2.1801,0.0489,0.5704,1.8392,2.9795,0.5849,4.1016,1.0272,0.0117,4.6341,1.7262,0.8253,7.5861,0.0023,4.5181,0.4838,0.4141,3.8651,4.3411,3.5918,3.5127,4.6682,4.2859,1.8006,3.311,2.4309,2.5793,2.7107,8.1713,10.0946,0.2973,1.3508,4.339,3.6715,5.0403,0.3335,3.9455,0.0336,0.4334,2.3996,3.6176,0.4259,5.4694,1.6309,4.5803,1.6143,1.0228,1.1409,2.1471,0.1655,2.3013,4.6016,1.5678,5.288,4.5252,7.7834,2.8876,4.0417,0.6684,3.5433,2.5334,1.481,5.1966,1.2579,4.6713,0.8346,0.871,0.7433,4.9669,3.4147,2.3566,3.1517,0.1371,4.7065,1.8968,6.6381,1.5028,1.3686,0.0066,0.8773,3.3683,4.2954,2.2694,3.6816,1.3006,2.941,3.6977,2.7126,0.2934,1.6518,6.3836,4.3345,1.4349,0.2702,4.9287,0.5491,3.2998,0.2722,0.5507,4.1981,3.3751,9.55,1.4025,2.5922,1.5824,0.5013,2.7314,4.8049,5.1409,1.0173,2.552,1.748,3.2,1.4752,0.267,3.2127,0.2094,1.1346,3.6591,4.6803,1.1122,3.698,1.6402,4.9199,1.7951,3.1482,0.8988,7.3515,5.8588,0.0587,0.5353,2.4146,0.0017,0.0011,0.6148,2.2908,1.9923,3.312,1.7997,1.2908,2.4942,1.7384,7.9541,0.0973,0.7265,8.9694,2.9806,5.6467,5.6594,1.4924,2.8676,0.8233,1.6939,2.0068,1.4603,2.7041,1.7425,4.7548,3.8181,6.0991,2.854,0.9607,0.7073,1.7801,4.5349,1.2667,3.8333,6.1868,3.7,0.231,0.0374,3.0602,0.7311,4.8498,0.5437,5.5151,4.0522,0.438,1.698,14.8442,4.7094,4.346,0.4701,1.4092,2.1089,4.1222,0.7698,5.8228,1.4961,0.1085,0.0671,2.6706,3.9301,2.0106,2.8714,4.7921,3.2042,2.5046,1.6879,1.8841,5.0501,4.3072,0.968,0.535,0.8289,0.0205,4.0054,7.7895,3.5409,2.7391,4.7727,1.3865,7.5411,0.4834,0.0993,4.6193,0.0165,0.0014,3.2808,3.3339,4.356,3.4243,2.6917,6.4778,2.1452,1.93,3.8937,3.3234,1.6018,0.7621,1.1763,1.5085,3.0371,2.4541,0.2906,0.3647,4.8481,0.0837,1.3488,3.6786,1.817,1.575,2.9789,2.4027,2.8895,0.701,5.6713,1.9464,0.1506,2.7972,1.2208,2.0706,6.2805,2.4448,4.6513,0.5921,4.9586,1.5558,0.5002,5.8221,2.7752,5.4474,3.9239,1.0554,2.7498,0.0135,4.4283,5.7633,4.0507,2.0155,2.7273,0.0078,1.2511,1.2133,3.9244,0.79,2.0537,1.8915,0.6764,3.3219,0.582,4.2692,0.0032,2.3878,5.0049,2.5485,2.2891,0.5867,3.1058,0.293,1.2548,0.617,1.1514,3.7381,3.7924,3.5509,5.4689,1.6147,3.1091,2.1448,4.9001,0.1948,4.0389,0.0541,0.0355,4.3011,0.4839,0.2533,0.6262,1.157,6.8476,1.3433,0.7075,2.9338,0.0021,1.944,2.5256,0.0681,1.1103,0.622,0.5442,4.657,2.5724,2.092,1.5554,0.8464,3.6701,6.1562,4.4784,0.0605,3.7464,2.5779,1.5808,4.8238,0.0779,0.0032,0.0032,3.809,3.3422,0.1686,0.2411,1.4692,1.2952,1.6545,1.8772,3.6119,2.2014,4.579,5.8373,1.2682,4.4016,2.6537,0.5096,0.4675,1.173,3.5962,2.8454,1.2731,5.5329,4.7011,3.83,1.2123,1.682,0.5115,1.6887,6.2154,2.1245,6.1499,4.5417,0.893,1.8936,0.0037,2.2915,1.2135,0.6445,5.2729,2.7765,5.2904,0.5542,0.9725,8.407,2.0529,2.2693,0.0285,1.6346]}
{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday eased off his earlier call to send the suspect in this week \u2019 s truck attack in New York City to the military prison in Guantanamo Bay , but","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday eased off his earlier call to send the suspect in this week \u2019 s truck attack in New York City to the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, but still expressed concern about his treatment in a military hospital.The president \u2019 s comments, made during an afternoon meeting with leaders of several countries involved in military cooperation, drew sharp backlash from Democrats. They said the comments \u201c further confirm Mr. Trump \u2019 s contempt for human life and for the rule of law.\u201dDemocrats also took issue over Trump\u2019s reaction to the deadly shooting in El Paso, Texas, and accused him of saying little on the shooting that left 22 people dead.\nBut Trump told a crowd of military leaders he worried about the \u201c mental health treatment \u201d of the suspect \u2014 also known as Omar Mateen \u2014 who carried out the attack in a New York nightclub in the town of Orlando, Florida, in June. He also indicated he was concerned about his future: \u201c Don \u2018 t think he \u2018 d be doing it now, if we hadn \u2018 t been so unbelievably bad.\u201d\nAnd he called for the arrest of one of the suspect\u2019s parents in the United Arab Emirates. \u201c I mean, these people \u2018 re so unbelievably bad, \u201d said Trump. \u201c I mean, you don \u2018 t see any kind of a problem with that, do you? \u201d\nIn the meeting, Trump spoke at length about the latest terror attacks, including the shooting in a Walmart in El Paso, and criticized Saudi Arabia and Egypt for its role in the attack in Norway in which at least 79 people died.\nTrump was not drawn on the attack in Orlando. But he repeatedly expressed his \u201c condolences \u201d after the killing at the Pulse nightclub in which he also had a brief speech.\n\u201c I \u2018 m not going to let it happen again, you know, \u201d he said. \u201c We \u2018 re going to do anything to stop it.\u201d He added that he planned to meet with authorities soon.\n\u201c I just want to make sure that we have a system to stop that, \u201d he said. \u201c You don \u2018 t want to do it to innocent people.\u201d\nTrump did not mention the attack in New York City, where 30 people were killed by a man whom he described as a \u201c mentally ill \u201d person.\nA few hours later in Washington, D.C.\u2019s national memorial, Trump sent his condolences to victims of the shooting in El Paso.\n\u201c I can \u2018 t express my heartbreak and disgust at such despicable acts, either when they happened or what took place here. These are acts of mass murder and mass devastation, \u201d he said, praising the El Paso County Sheriff\u2019s Department \u2018s investigation.","token_len":593,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.5734,2.3533,10.2295,5.2337,1.4545,6.054,3.965,2.3642,5.319,2.8263,8.7678,2.2755,5.534,0.8287,20.0913,7.9489,8.6163,8.7671,4.7285,1.9888,3.8717,0.1817,1.2863,0.7199,1.5641,4.0005,1.7939,0.7515,1.3053,0.0646,0.5254,9.5416,3.8818,4.8649,2.1308,0.9529,2.7412,3.8616,2.1528,2.7551,3.1807,2.7526,0.6588,4.6864,2.5993,8.1292,0.933,1.9954,3.5433,3.3567,2.5592,1.8174,1.8407,3.7705,2.237,0.24,4.737,0.3417,3.9716,1.8892,6.9538,0.0246,4.0164,4.7933,0.7813,3.9536,1.766,5.2773,0.4811,4.3129,2.411,4.5613,1.9828,1.5805,1.6961,5.6006,6.1393,10.5993,5.5987,4.4048,0.1066,0.1181,1.8423,0.1603,0.1291,6.0012,0.0699,3.4433,3.6332,1.3904,4.3104,0.8434,0.6903,0.0046,0.0006,1.0343,4.5225,7.6064,6.8814,2.902,4.3269,0.8652,7.4327,4.0873,3.7967,0.2633,3.6607,6.0195,0.1331,1.0569,4.6366,2.4115,1.7417,8.7025,1.9819,0.2014,0.1148,0.4858,3.5545,5.2705,0.9237,0.0578,5.0827,6.6541,3.7656,1.0673,3.7655,4.0132,2.9493,4.8545,0.7083,0.0301,1.1047,3.218,14.8321,3.2041,5.3772,3.4059,2.5297,0.9386,5.7009,2.8127,4.4729,6.9672,0.3926,1.3306,10.0537,2.0249,7.3671,0.7332,5.2936,2.3972,4.9184,2.9642,1.8085,1.141,4.757,5.4599,1.0764,0.0582,1.6183,0.1544,0.0003,1.556,2.0499,5.4738,0.0614,0.2886,0.9047,2.1291,2.0241,6.202,0.1499,4.0864,2.6759,3.6775,7.7258,0.3196,1.8414,1.7647,1.2938,1.005,2.5168,1.6186,0.4856,2.9528,2.061,4.9369,0.8538,1.7318,1.0786,0.3136,2.305,5.7247,7.3211,3.5248,1.1,8.0994,1.7796,6.1477,6.6934,3.3026,1.6412,1.7762,4.0488,3.7277,4.686,3.8729,3.8234,4.1741,1.8658,3.7292,3.9616,7.4118,1.7728,1.3549,3.65,2.3278,3.8703,8.6808,2.1418,1.5783,2.8099,0.8184,0.9222,8.3557,1.6424,3.6869,1.193,2.2258,5.927,0.1603,5.4316,0.26,0.4702,3.8316,2.69,2.1458,1.2349,5.4742,3.1302,1.4109,4.0258,3.279,0.0009,1.5889,2.5729,0.891,3.5886,2.6268,0.4748,5.3937,1.8681,2.3796,2.323,7.3787,8.0872,5.8403,0.5138,1.5228,2.3253,3.2705,5.8636,2.8607,1.2351,1.1083,0.8903,1.8865,0.5672,0.1447,2.9867,3.2965,2.0449,0.4642,2.1049,4.0078,2.9126,4.1197,0.0186,4.3831,3.0956,1.3386,1.5258,1.8141,3.4859,0.0488,0.7105,1.2586,1.4418,0.9199,4.9006,2.172,4.4267,0.9121,1.2904,4.2993,4.4944,0.0117,0.1206,1.2264,6.1918,4.2079,1.4179,1.4591,1.8103,0.8937,2.9829,0.8112,4.4597,7.9174,0.7513,6.7335,0.087,0.4142,5.06,6.0017,5.5998,0.0437,2.178,3.2917,0.5927,4.3284,2.9829,0.063,0.7627,2.3248,2.9185,7.8482,4.0858,3.4953,3.6349,0.0006,7.0797,0.0782,1.6433,0.354,0.791,2.6097,4.2029,3.9208,5.8654,0.9377,1.7533,4.7276,1.0296,2.2536,2.0252,2.8462,0.5178,5.3014,2.8235,1.7318,8.3291,0.9403,5.0431,4.4974,0.9934,5.2468,1.1829,4.6562,3.4055,1.3734,0.3896,0.1305,0.6617,7.3184,8.6928,6.9352,3.8684,1.2724,3.5837,4.1945,0.8853,0.574,2.4573,0.8657,1.4676,4.0276,2.2129,3.6018,3.2171,1.4693,0.1113,4.11,2.7847,2.5037,0.6707,1.2438,4.3052,0.4168,0.622,1.4003,1.212,1.6321,0.4492,0.4109,0.2632,0.8194,3.7021,2.9784,1.2778,5.6845,3.0484,0.1792,2.5269,5.4598,2.1297,1.8041,0.4013,0.949,3.4472,0.3103,3.3812,4.0756,1.0444,0.9051,6.021,0.1398,2.5312,0.2328,7.0885,3.2108,0.8705,0.5092,1.653,0.1258,1.4869,3.4732,1.1345,0.249,2.0442,0.2259,1.313,1.3125,2.3854,1.5063,4.2946,3.5665,2.1576,3.4663,1.8197,1.5506,0.4789,0.5817,0.2871,0.1595,0.5119,0.3748,3.9569,4.4206,1.9186,0.7483,2.52,1.8036,0.8004,2.5808,2.1709,5.4304,6.4534,0.1984,1.0042,2.7456,0.131,0.5005,1.8542,4.2444,0.231,2.9063,1.0147,2.802,0.6588,2.6786,0.0161,1.5652,1.2061,2.4543,7.0871,0.4076,0.2132,0.2555,3.4362,0.9598,3.023,5.6184,0.2564,1.8343,0.096,0.5799,7.5902,0.4593,6.0372,0.9219,3.6989,1.9803,6.0152,0.9855,0.679,4.686,3.4277,0.948,0.8134,3.6055,2.6905,0.1328,1.8021,0.0008,0.0034,3.3462,4.6524,4.659,3.4136,6.8212,6.2374,1.9629,1.5814,6.1936,3.3219,0.1463,0.4519,2.4343,0.8023,0.4107,2.1278,1.3857,4.7011,0.0064,0.9498,0.6462,1.5681,0.2391,1.269,4.0464,3.0565,1.2555,3.4054,6.2957,0.7261,5.4379,5.0219,0.9936,5.8649,1.5952,4.9822,3.832,0.7654,2.1431,7.8978,6.3528,1.1374,2.9137,0.5614,4.946,5.4679,0.003,3.4783,1.6871,6.3629,1.1801,6.0025,0.5577,5.3313,0.5879,2.1954,4.1167,5.245,1.5607,1.506,0.5974,1.1028,0.2267,2.6038,6.607,0.7975,9.1595,0.0041,3.7504,0.1123,5.336,0.8732,0.1374,2.9076,4.4032,1.4299,7.1511,6.0802,1.1355]}
{"prompt":"The U.S. House of Representatives is unlikely to raise the country \u2019 s debt ceiling without conditions to rein in spending , a Republican lawmaker said on Tuesday , raising the specter of another potential","text":"The U.S. House of Representatives is unlikely to raise the country \u2019 s debt ceiling without conditions to rein in spending, a Republican lawmaker said on Tuesday, raising the specter of another potential federal shutdown that could last for weeks. The speaker of the House of Representatives, the longest-serving Republican in the body, called on leaders of a bipartisan group of House Democratic leaders and Senate Democrats to begin negotiating what may be a longer-than-three- week government shutdown, a development that could threaten a Republican proposal to raise the country \u2019 s debt ceiling.\nThe Senate\u2019s top Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, announced in a statement that the House should hold an emergency meeting of the House Budget Committee Monday to discuss the nation\u2019s short-term financing needs. \u201cWe can only meet today if we do our job and convene an emergency funding session at a moment\u2019s notice so we can have some idea what the government\u2019s cash reserves and other financing options are,\u201d Schumer said. The statement referred to an official list of debt that some U.S. creditors have requested Congress raise, adding that the list \u201cwould include a range of borrowing levels, subject to the terms of existing agreements and whether a Congressional vote were considered.\u201c\u201dThe House will proceed \u2026 with a special finance bill at a meeting today\u201d on Thursday. \u201cIf the bill does not raise the cash balance to the desired levels, the Senate will proceed with one of two options: a fiscal 2014 balance plan, with a special one-year supplement and the possibility of a supplement for FY 15, or, if necessary, an increase to the current debt ceiling, with provisions for one or more extensions of its duration,\u201d Schumer said in a separate statement.\nGOP members of Congress on Monday proposed a temporary spending bill that would raise the debt ceiling and address longstanding budget issues by reauthorizing the Defense Department for another year. \u201cThe legislation raises the debt ceiling to avoid another short-term funding freeze. It also provides for greater flexibility to address longstanding budget and foreign policy issues,\u201d Rep. John Larson, the majority\u2019s Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement, referring to the House Finance Committee in which he and his committee have a majority. It was a first step in a process that could lead to a Republican attempt to raise the limit and other possible actions it could lead to, congressional sources said. The Senate should follow suit and consider the bill on Monday, Rep. Frank Pallone, the Democrat who chairs the upper house\u2019s committee responsible for spending, said during a conference call with reporters.\u201dThis is a matter of urgency to our country now \u2026 and is very dangerous, not only for what it could mean for the country, but for what it could indicate for the future debt limit,\u201d Pallone said.","token_len":593,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2998,0.4341,0.0098,2.4335,6.0722,0.0165,5.9927,0.8591,4.9001,17.2029,7.49,8.2479,4.4162,0.2909,4.3672,8.9497,2.9933,6.3175,0.1593,3.092,2.1466,3.1908,3.5202,1.9223,0.6974,1.9848,1.6084,1.8401,3.7774,0.6048,2.2287,0.0403,0.1855,3.945,5.3222,6.4427,1.9324,3.4957,0.5303,4.6878,1.933,2.1772,0.4162,3.8429,4.3585,1.0194,0.0359,0.582,2.4641,0.0029,0.5884,5.4657,4.8719,0.1708,0.0224,1.3499,0.3712,0.6965,6.9407,0.0932,4.1579,1.2239,6.4547,1.4024,5.5496,2.8802,0.5423,0.5643,3.4865,5.8302,1.0359,3.1341,2.8927,1.3182,0.1798,5.2147,2.6044,5.5623,4.5622,0.3071,0.8719,6.1765,0.1846,4.7027,0.024,8.8963,0.0564,9.9267,4.8097,0.0266,2.7197,2.9039,7.09,0.4324,0.9701,4.6675,2.868,4.5359,6.8992,0.3652,1.8947,0.1243,2.6226,7.9306,0.3981,0.263,0.4379,0.3212,2.0888,1.41,14.0649,3.8141,7.1037,0.8603,1.5343,4.0949,3.3942,0.8741,0.2646,2.5535,7.5981,0.506,4.6972,3.6013,0.6638,0.7374,0.7717,1.4591,1.9514,3.5436,3.0134,2.4712,0.4054,1.1455,2.0861,1.0884,1.9389,2.6769,0.0305,4.7645,1.2469,1.1426,0.9991,5.1169,3.6855,0.6336,3.0886,5.5137,0.1823,0.0477,5.0356,2.9761,1.2373,5.2008,4.4953,8.5475,3.2137,2.2136,6.3248,5.5002,2.0327,1.0847,4.2412,4.3358,1.7793,1.6925,7.6086,0.0006,2.6378,0.22,7.1218,4.5924,4.3541,3.0331,3.7143,4.3787,0.1076,2.3109,3.0814,4.8873,1.8485,0.2094,4.3308,3.8616,5.6531,1.9268,1.6719,2.9411,2.8841,0.1026,0.3768,7.395,4.226,3.6339,2.4482,5.073,2.8176,0.4419,2.253,5.4071,7.6005,5.6797,0.4535,0.3478,2.9204,5.3804,5.8157,0.1377,3.0395,5.1088,6.8656,0.4431,4.3587,4.7066,6.2582,5.0724,0.0021,0.0035,0.0043,6.2088,1.4371,2.2401,6.7575,1.8099,2.0436,5.4332,0.2376,1.4732,4.2606,4.8618,1.7718,6.4573,1.7272,2.593,4.3781,0.1118,4.9951,2.6432,1.6422,8.0703,0.0984,2.2404,3.6698,0.2118,5.1066,3.5195,2.404,6.7381,3.4749,6.4905,3.0112,6.5567,6.8606,0.6117,3.7215,0.7979,2.5047,2.8737,5.9661,1.8058,2.9758,5.9875,10.3793,2.1453,1.4756,4.7109,8.1058,3.5905,5.2814,1.5081,3.0171,4.4563,2.1246,2.2824,5.1265,4.3427,1.6237,2.4857,0.4239,3.3958,1.6685,3.6555,2.591,0.1944,3.6345,1.1736,6.5287,5.9928,4.2921,1.8749,5.0956,2.8964,0.6545,1.9749,2.9823,0.9779,2.2583,1.0991,6.4292,1.2646,1.4016,1.0521,1.6094,3.438,5.6033,7.3903,8.082,3.4123,2.5579,3.4845,1.7941,5.7195,7.5697,0.5309,0.6126,10.025,3.0097,3.0753,4.8693,0.1853,1.1135,10.1121,2.7517,3.4224,6.7375,2.0373,1.5794,5.2995,1.1275,3.2556,0.0594,2.6034,4.0058,2.4723,0.7213,1.9644,3.2753,0.6337,2.8326,1.5638,6.2857,1.0905,6.8571,2.858,0.6863,3.5613,1.0743,6.8539,4.7673,2.7612,1.8455,0.9395,2.4732,0.2207,3.4475,1.3302,5.5432,0.0554,0.1962,0.7096,6.2861,4.8818,0.9976,0.5093,4.2262,1.6879,5.3234,1.341,4.251,2.3896,1.609,0.8107,0.491,1.7374,0.2723,1.4148,0.2079,2.7532,6.3683,7.0564,2.4607,2.3479,4.0862,5.7462,1.6598,0.0105,0.883,4.7747,0.3548,4.5935,3.7343,0.9043,0.8822,3.6437,0.4076,1.6311,4.5235,7.0075,0.3837,1.2256,0.2809,2.3847,5.0561,3.0693,5.223,0.055,0.014,3.5511,4.6447,2.7723,2.9214,1.4132,4.2967,1.2501,6.0957,0.8521,1.9722,4.3381,5.7292,0.9494,3.1293,4.7227,0.4344,0.7921,1.4909,4.5766,0.7578,5.0303,0.0038,3.2329,4.4928,1.3364,2.5524,5.4015,12.144,0.4174,0.8906,2.7494,2.2258,1.4189,0.0063,0.3184,3.3771,0.0266,0.0001,0.0447,0.0932,0.406,0.6561,0.1317,0.1394,3.9291,3.7866,0.0308,1.0132,2.3167,4.9365,0.0205,4.7866,2.2083,1.5022,2.9718,2.5178,3.1418,2.6533,3.9078,1.3135,0.2347,5.1724,3.0942,3.1079,5.1308,1.905,1.492,1.5565,2.3802,0.6048,2.3222,3.0046,0.1016,0.9294,6.4559,4.7568,0.1224,1.3564,0.0813,6.5486,3.4626,4.9736,5.0275,4.457,6.5292,1.8622,9.7464,0.6017,1.5124,7.6006,0.9003,0.6158,0.1511,2.5621,3.2336,4.2734,4.2036,2.4911,2.126,2.8579,1.3135,2.7958,3.6429,2.0719,0.7868,3.8065,0.0019,5.2492,0.3816,0.0011,0.6075,0.9937,2.3228,1.8382,1.4499,0.0588,5.5994,3.0548,3.6063,0.3044,0.0276,3.4807,7.7447,0.0025,3.7025,0.6284,0.4492,4.807,0.2342,3.0198,0.0056,0.9891,0.1029,0.7685,3.0961,2.387,8.1133,1.4274,1.083,4.9455,0.4689,2.4059,2.7498,3.5385,1.5207,5.9276,6.5496,1.4381,4.7995,4.2984,5.2613,2.2125,4.3599,1.0243,0.8466,6.0443,2.6357,2.5362,0.9325,0.2479,1.6598,2.1566,1.1151,0.4834,0.9425,1.8558,1.0131,0.5078,8.8151,2.0248,1.1164,0.9427,8.8748,2.0804,2.4317,0.5998,0.5109,0.3074,0.0005,0.4222,0.302]}
{"prompt":"Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker on Friday signed a bill raising the tax on retail sales of recreational marijuana to 20 percent , up from the 12 percent rate proposed in a successful 2016 ballot initiative","text":"Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker on Friday signed a bill raising the tax on retail sales of recreational marijuana to 20 percent, up from the 12 percent rate proposed in a successful 2016 ballot initiative. Gov. Ralph Northam on Thursday signed into law legislation legalizing medical marijuana, triggering another statewide election to legalize the recreational drug later this year. The Virginia Senate will take up legislation this month legalizing recreational weed, a vote that will likely take place earlier than that for another ballot proposition legalizing medical marijuana. The Colorado House on Thursday passed a ballot measure legalizing recreational marijuana, marking the second state to legalize marijuana after California. A new state law passed by the New Mexico legislature this month lets marijuana legalization activists petition the governor for an online public initiative on recreational marijuana. In Maine, marijuana advocates and opponents are preparing for another legalization debate this fall on a ballot proposal that would allow a two-drug test and a $1,000 fine for marijuana possession. In Mississippi, state legislators on Thursday signed onto a measure legalizing hemp cultivation, which now can be considered a commodity in a taxable fashion like a commodity crop like corn and soybeans.\nGov. Charlie Baker on Friday signed a bill raising the tax on retail sales of recreational marijuana to 20 percent, up from the 12 percent rate proposed in a successful 2016 ballot initiative.\nThe bill increases retail sales taxes for marijuana edibles and flower by 10 percent and the tax for marijuana cigarettes and marijuana concentrates by 20 percent.\nBaker did nothing more than hold his thumb over the signature pads when the governor signed the bill at his office in Salem, Massachusetts.\nThe bill increases retail sales taxes for marijuana edibles and flower by 10 percent and the tax for marijuana cigarettes and marijuana concentrates by 20 percent. That would raise $45 million for Massachusetts state coffers.

Safe work practices are the set of procedures and systems an employer\/contractor provides to ensure all employees are safe at work.\nEmployees, visitors, contractors and consultants working in the construction industry should follow good personal behaviour and safety rules that will help protect them. These work standards apply to everyone from workers performing the simplest tasks, to those with the most power in a workplace.\nEmployees must be clear about the health and safety arrangements in their place of work, including what is required of them to do.\nIf the employer\/contractor is aware that there is a danger and that actions must be taken to overcome it, but does not do so, they may be guilty of a criminal offence, punishable by fines and\/or imprisonment. The offence also includes not taking steps to ensure the health and safety of another person at the employer\u2019s or contractor\u2019s request.\nIn accordance with section 19 of the Construction Regulations 2021, employers must provide all employees with the information and documentation that they need to know about the health and safety management system.","token_len":594,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2998,0.4341,0.0098,3.3722,1.4847,2.6089,0.4113,0.2115,4.9112,2.7724,1.7988,1.8607,14.6082,7.5696,8.5626,3.3581,0.1845,0.9064,2.8641,4.539,9.0409,1.6207,0.1121,2.4016,4.4798,1.3077,1.5904,0.9697,3.7068,2.6325,9.0186,3.6048,2.3175,0.5799,1.8896,2.1385,2.0988,3.1772,1.146,2.0217,1.0543,3.4332,5.0086,10.1245,0.0439,2.4954,1.0629,1.3539,0.0002,4.2324,1.2334,5.2761,4.1434,3.4905,2.2168,5.3521,0.7366,5.6059,1.363,14.6789,2.5979,15.6438,3.3321,3.001,5.3969,6.2686,7.9255,9.202,2.2936,3.6337,3.3982,2.0402,0.0349,2.9502,2.5638,5.0342,5.046,1.3454,4.9956,1.9959,7.8535,5.4604,0.6395,0.644,4.1388,0.0429,4.2179,2.603,4.5652,3.2009,2.5379,2.5482,3.9155,1.0469,0.7198,1.8611,4.0052,5.3247,1.2575,7.0743,0.4081,0.9194,5.9914,2.7454,1.2492,0.6873,1.5856,2.006,2.2138,1.866,8.7277,6.4499,0.4185,1.2046,2.2277,0.0176,1.0561,2.2142,4.1378,0.7516,3.8872,5.3192,5.8329,2.3872,3.4367,4.1322,0.63,0.224,3.1143,2.1019,0.0039,5.5239,0.367,2.9818,4.8961,0.0016,6.4722,3.953,2.483,5.533,1.8,5.1305,2.2879,3.6444,6.136,2.3243,0.4854,0.338,1.7864,5.7993,0.2488,4.7355,2.1884,6.4768,4.9599,1.8157,5.4298,4.6701,1.5844,4.9319,1.5403,0.0097,1.5247,1.5612,1.2573,1.674,4.3282,0.0186,3.9157,2.2858,2.4404,0.4397,0.0028,1.7853,2.5232,0.9308,4.4542,0.6576,7.7602,5.1143,0.7567,0.9228,1.0081,5.6298,3.2541,4.0707,0.8915,5.0727,5.412,6.778,2.0241,5.5877,3.9687,1.8599,7.4209,2.1802,7.0114,5.8968,13.6782,2.2742,4.7573,2.0868,4.1506,4.5542,5.8177,2.7759,3.2649,5.9949,1.3778,0.0525,5.045,1.9129,4.8003,0.4437,1.6893,3.104,4.791,0.2025,0.0056,4.2965,11.6313,2.1839,6.213,0.3078,1.311,0.8159,2.7026,0.2974,0.0253,7.791,0.421,0.2298,7.3332,0.4958,5.6018,4.8726,0.6974,2.9988,0.3088,6.3272,2.3687,0.3988,3.2467,1.8256,1.4262,3.3873,6.8594,0.0361,1.0953,0.4899,4.5556,2.936,4.2709,2.0219,3.237,6.0923,4.1228,0.2535,0.0063,3.7597,0.8063,1.872,6.2077,0.0227,2.4579,1.2436,5.6846,0.545,0.0081,1.6758,7.2732,2.052,2.4551,2.2101,5.3362,5.2686,1.1014,0.9081,0.2811,1.2153,4.7111,4.3163,0.013,0.6625,2.2746,0.2823,2.9624,3.9568,7.7702,2.7924,0.0407,0.6719,6.4286,2.8613,0.8515,0.0067,3.1549,3.1967,0.0808,0.0099,5.1574,2.436,4.0541,0.0661,3.7404,4.665,0.0108,4.6769,3.5949,0.5923,1.3344,1.0168,8.7942,0.2688,1.3826,0.0557,0.0008,0.532,0.1504,1.1809,3.8489,5.7137,0.0105,4.0376,1.5322,0.9639,0.8709,9.1507,6.3001,1.0465,7.9162,0.1523,2.4277,0.2489,0.0086,6.8478,2.9264,1.2885,1.9424,6.4725,0.7306,2.0805,1.7284,2.0095,4.7332,0.3666,7.0521,0.0674,3.7592,0.5256,1.1865,3.9114,1.936,0.0011,6.6006,4.6473,0.074,0.001,0.5659,1.1573,0.161,2.1437,3.1202,2.5307,0.3256,5.7867,3.6856,0.7525,5.3352,6.0975,3.8257,8.1906,4.0466,8.8481,0.9684,8.1408,2.4824,0.5819,1.2984,2.7574,8.051,0.1027,3.7961,0.7992,5.1147,6.4552,0.0611,0.9691,0.019,0.0043,5.2172,0.7776,0.6039,3.8198,0.7237,1.0427,2.3172,3.8958,0.2467,0.3928,1.1618,3.4433,1.3892,3.7286,8.0648,0.8533,1.0981,0.8,5.7197,2.7394,0.9555,1.1841,0.5256,0.4054,1.8907,3.0677,6.8948,6.5527,5.7876,1.3998,4.0265,3.1412,2.8269,3.4905,3.5796,2.6043,2.0108,2.4199,3.5017,6.0613,3.9257,4.6003,0.3477,3.9581,2.7545,3.9216,6.218,3.4737,8.6966,1.2264,2.2724,0.529,2.3381,2.8664,2.3965,0.6853,6.3384,2.9561,3.0557,3.2933,0.8599,0.7711,2.6275,0.3995,3.2973,2.0948,4.9946,1.0955,1.9409,3.5629,0.0843,0.0136,9.2449,3.0948,1.2336,5.9137,0.2328,0.3049,1.7037,2.7576,3.5693,2.1643,2.4621,1.7137,0.1006,2.7432,1.5627,2.0571,2.1453,4.0077,3.3932,1.5914,0.4972,0.0166,0.0079,1.9561,4.0284,1.6197,3.1126,0.5519,0.4903,4.0108,5.4665,2.9663,7.6697,3.0829,0.0476,0.0104,0.7288,6.988,1.0504,0.1065,6.8404,1.7214,0.0316,4.4463,0.5299,0.4652,1.9022,2.4822,1.0413,5.6432,0.0117,1.8538,2.674,0.2568,2.8336,2.6607,0.1695,3.3858,1.9812,1.158,0.0011,0.3664,1.1047,3.2475,5.5153,5.0151,2.3938,6.0448,4.1431,2.7093,0.2331,2.4843,1.9518,2.306,0.1038,0.0164,0.1109,5.7736,1.4536,3.7731,1.8078,4.3354,9.3456,1.3039,2.4046,5.9036,1.1515,1.2159,0.0202,0.0261,4.506,0.476,0.5195,3.3698,4.6296,0.0052,5.8436,4.7655,0.831,0.2335,3.825,0.1295,2.2152,0.3995,1.3841,2.0361,2.8375,3.5457,0.8404,0.2884,2.1699,3.1105,2.3657,4.6133,2.319,1.6831,0.398,0.5008,3.6655,1.2543,1.3018,0.748,0.0203,0.0041,5.0516,1.0387,1.5004]}

The topic is \u201cDrawing on nature.\u201d The idea is to gather artists together and focus on the idea of nature as the primary source for drawing, painting, and sculpture. This was one of the first times that the idea of an \u201cartist in situ\u201d is applied to art education in Italy, and I was very excited to teach alongside Michela Bagnolo and Luca Tittori. We worked with the artists in Rome and had a chance to draw in the natural areas of the Roman countryside. We met regularly to discuss their works and to share their personal thoughts about the process of drawing in nature. By the end of the week I was deeply inspired by the artists\u2019 generosity and their talent. Here are some of my favorite memories from the weekend.\nTo start the workshop we focused on drawing on paper. We read a chapter of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cThe Science of Drawing\u201d, which taught the way artists in the Renaissance learned to draw by experimenting with drawing and painting on paper. There were quite a few interesting moments where Michela and Luca showed us very practical uses of different materials to draw, such as different kinds of papers, charcoal, crayons, and colored pencils.\nAfter a lunch break we took a walk in the woods around Rome. We were shown several locations around Rome where artists can draw and paint in natural settings. These include the Villa d\u2019Este, and some of the medieval structures in the Roman Palatine Hills. We walked all around some of these sites and drew pictures, sketches, and paintings from nature. At the end of the walk I was still getting lost in the beauty of the trees and the fresh air I was breathing.","token_len":594,"entropy":[9.1932,0.0208,3.53,2.764,10.0414,5.5047,3.2898,10.8804,4.5626,3.6418,4.3482,4.6725,0.7268,5.8427,0.4954,0.4806,1.9497,3.2492,2.3054,2.871,0.0443,5.8642,7.1255,4.6498,0.0093,6.7098,2.5262,0.001,2.3434,2.5193,7.2801,0.0097,7.6104,1.8828,1.1274,14.2092,0.3703,4.5701,2.1315,11.6016,3.875,0.0201,1.1143,13.5503,3.0524,0.4858,6.4377,2.7184,1.5868,0.6885,1.8717,1.099,3.1367,15.9858,7.5396,10.5175,0.1647,2.0682,3.9682,6.3965,6.1878,2.2789,4.7688,5.4324,7.0041,1.0153,5.0157,4.4356,1.2463,3.4385,7.9721,0.4025,0.8585,1.6169,4.2219,3.0601,2.3373,2.1037,1.2987,1.9572,6.0738,0.117,8.7406,5.0149,3.1513,4.481,0.3344,1.0687,2.2951,4.7851,4.7575,0.7147,3.553,1.3865,7.6808,3.8342,6.4482,0.0634,0.0014,0.2393,8.5426,3.7965,5.6206,5.6467,3.3271,2.0204,2.8478,4.4474,4.6365,0.1377,3.213,2.0608,1.5988,0.0806,1.1616,1.5975,4.0211,2.3093,2.4467,2.2481,1.8624,0.0087,4.2428,6.7714,0.6974,0.8381,2.792,3.3158,0.114,3.4806,1.0329,5.9468,1.9494,6.3195,4.1632,6.445,2.489,10.8094,2.1545,4.4604,0.0402,0.1214,4.8947,1.5431,2.6895,3.4133,0.0031,0.0015,0.1144,6.493,5.5556,2.3255,2.1166,3.2888,1.7559,10.8836,6.7104,4.0111,4.4093,0.0324,8.3239,4.1387,1.0695,1.6392,3.4852,0.0385,0.5953,3.1831,1.2998,0.0458,1.8903,1.9546,1.5546,2.9171,4.1942,4.4546,4.0802,6.0998,4.7718,2.1668,0.1804,1.9841,2.1705,7.4022,4.2347,0.8938,0.7079,1.6614,4.5745,2.3098,3.6024,1.185,2.8528,0.9941,1.1394,1.212,4.6543,0.0026,0.0013,0.099,3.8405,5.918,0.1027,2.7357,13.758,0.2461,4.7464,1.4622,5.939,0.4606,5.9932,10.9617,4.74,1.0043,6.6955,5.2298,0.2602,7.1711,0.6865,6.0943,2.4508,0.0011,0.7963,5.9219,0.9745,0.0019,6.3417,2.3647,6.3468,3.5469,6.2461,1.3938,6.436,0.7724,0.6028,1.6722,5.1618,1.9924,0.7561,2.1253,5.2346,4.1121,7.6368,0.9779,10.2824,0.2017,2.7599,7.9235,4.5923,1.7912,5.8647,2.0949,5.7401,1.2817,0.7468,6.4878,3.4904,5.1288,2.0163,6.3993,0.2871,1.5401,5.169,0.4056,4.6134,2.1252,2.4238,4.3046,1.6979,2.3186,6.8872,2.6626,2.6247,0.2698,1.1018,0.6941,0.8444,3.419,4.8241,3.7349,0.1969,0.8997,2.7023,4.148,2.844,3.4189,4.2997,1.3215,4.1317,9.8634,0.0532,5.324,3.9718,5.7737,1.4973,3.1555,3.8891,5.4977,0.98,1.9403,8.3204,2.2002,0.9572,2.5885,1.8296,2.272,2.1117,2.877,2.126,0.6636,7.3667,7.8483,7.7906,5.4084,4.2484,4.3308,5.5333,2.2939,5.0962,0.3268,5.0442,6.1623,2.4822,1.636,3.5344,4.8624,1.7995,2.8982,3.1011,3.0636,4.0756,2.1446,5.7596,0.9019,3.9175,0.2276,6.8142,4.3248,2.5969,7.2682,4.7096,1.1434,1.4756,6.4318,3.2299,1.3734,2.1764,3.9092,8.3807,2.9885,1.7542,4.3616,2.9019,1.3739,2.5071,2.0473,1.2173,3.9609,4.8428,2.6201,1.6847,4.5619,0.9224,2.6781,3.1792,3.9878,0.7783,6.4114,0.9804,0.3471,0.2289,0.6071,2.186,3.3253,1.1035,6.3266,2.5478,0.8689,1.4767,3.7064,6.5353,1.1607,16.9004,1.245,3.2243,5.8905,1.5614,5.9983,1.7085,0.6386,0.513,1.9125,2.5359,5.5364,1.9806,1.3735,6.2814,1.8187,4.5941,5.4732,3.9099,2.6341,0.4695,3.3206,6.0808,0.221,3.6093,3.3051,7.6026,2.0236,1.8202,6.8647,2.0359,6.7491,1.0788,5.8697,0.3111,0.0005,0.0,2.8648,0.5605,1.464,6.6581,0.2037,2.3909,7.6453,0.1069,2.464,0.9085,2.1622,3.8166,1.7619,6.8893,3.711,4.287,4.7424,4.4708,1.7817,1.6659,3.9661,0.7452,0.6456,3.7297,6.1366,0.3453,4.7981,2.5068,1.6767,3.128,0.2558,0.2932,4.5551,1.1217,5.4774,0.0425,0.1832,4.054,3.9402,4.7775,6.6987,0.1231,1.7891,0.8129,0.0018,3.5076,1.146,6.041,5.1611,4.6564,0.356,6.0293,2.4663,2.7117,2.0745,2.364,2.6512,0.0058,6.1467,3.3902,0.0181,6.9069,1.3345,7.9726,0.665,8.4193,0.1324,0.3775,0.1709,1.404,5.9305,1.862,0.0731,0.2986,3.1014,3.4591,2.201,6.222,1.8257,0.9404,3.5812,0.8514,2.2539,2.6506,0.5189,2.4616,4.3012,5.169,1.4337,1.5867,2.467,5.92,3.5747,5.4914,2.7937,1.6014,1.8408,2.776,3.482,2.3078,2.0637,2.2763,2.8047,4.2973,1.9911,0.617,4.2483,3.1653,1.5033,7.8216,4.9606,13.7451,2.5318,4.6983,3.2685,2.6905,4.2624,3.9602,1.0669,0.108,6.323,6.2472,2.1917,0.8846,4.3259,5.6884,1.7261,0.6868,4.9888,0.4581,1.9609,4.4056,4.8519,1.4711,6.5024,0.4343,0.8613,1.9177,1.1957,5.3726,5.1386,2.9213,4.0696,0.1197,0.5312,3.1399,3.703,6.9359,0.7897,4.3104,0.7207,0.6587,0.0893,0.1577,2.5543,2.8142,1.5924,6.6273,5.7272,4.4996,1.0716,0.5534,5.2619,0.3466,0.7629,4.0834,1.0033,0.9873,6.426,1.413,5.2369,0.9592,4.1356,0.7467]}

The two lanes of the interstate connecting Tacoma to Seattle were shut down for several hours until authorities could clear the debris, which came down in a pile. The cause of the crash is suspected to have been from heavy rain which filled the water in the trestle bridge. The UPS truck driver who struck the train has been charged with multiple counts of murder. The driver of the UPS truck later died in a hospital, but the driver of the train has not been identified.\nThe president, who took to Twitter about the accident, also wrote that this was just the beginning of the \u201cAmerican Renaissance.\u201d He also thanked \u201cthe first responders with so much talent.\u201d\nAn 18-wheeler carrying a UPS cargo trailer to deliver a shipment of toys rolled through a narrow tunnel between Washington, D.C. and Virginia, forcing lane closures and sending commuters stuck in their vehicles. The truck rolled about 5 miles before it stopped in its tracks, causing a four-car collision with two cars colliding at a red school bell.\nThis accident happened near the city\u2019s Union Station. Authorities say that there were a handful of injuries.\nThe driver of the truck has since been charged with first-degree vehicular homicide. He reportedly drove with a blood-alcohol reading of.10, which is.05 above the legal limit, and was allegedly drunk at the time of the crash. His brother and family members said that he had been drinking \u201cheavily\u201d for days prior.\nThe incident comes following a spate of accidents involving semi-trucks and semi-trailers in recent weeks. For example, one semi-tractor-trailer went down a cliff into a ravine in northwestern Washington in mid-February, injuring 22 people before finally coming to a stop in February.

{"prompt":"A power outage hit parts of the Venezuelan capital Caracas as well as the nearby states of Miranda and Vargas for around five hours on Monday , in what critics said was another sign of","text":"A power outage hit parts of the Venezuelan capital Caracas as well as the nearby states of Miranda and Vargas for around five hours on Monday, in what critics said was another sign of problems with the national electric company's outages and blackouts in recent months.\nA day earlier, President Nicolas Maduro said the blackout appeared to be caused by sabotage in the system, after he criticised the utility for not identifying the culprit, but said some parts of the power grid were damaged by Hurricane Eta earlier this week.\nIn recent weeks, some parts of the power grid have suffered recurrent outages, leading to numerous blackouts, which have been blamed mainly on overwork and equipment failures.\nOn Monday, some of Caracas' lights are still flickering, particularly in areas where there is less power supply, such as the city's international airport, some buildings around the national stadium, and in the neighbourhoods of the elite El Rosal and San Diego.\n\"Everything was black and I could not think of anything to do, so my father turned on the television with no sound,\" said 19-year-old student Francisco Perez, who was sleeping in the street's park under the bright moonlight.\nThe authorities have blamed sabotage in the power network, saying that some of the equipment's circuits were replaced without first properly dismantling the old ones.\nThe government has blamed foreign actors for the outages, an accusation that has not been proven yet.\n\"We don't have the energy to know what is happening, to tell you the truth,\" said Mr Juan Pablo Perdomo, secretary at the Venezuelan High Council for Foreign Affairs. \"But these saboteurs want to create panic.\"\nOn Monday, the country's oil minister said the latest disruptions to the nation's electric grid came as President Donald Trump has put pressure on Venezuela to let US-based Citgo stand as collateral for a US$1.5 billion (S$2 billion) loan guarantee from Brazil's state-backed oil company Petrobras.\nMr Perdomo said an \"unknown actor\" was responsible for the outages. \"We don't have the energy to find the culprit,\" he said.\n\"We cannot wait for the culprit to find themselves in the hands of the Venezuelan authorities,\" he added.\nMr Perdomo called the outages a \"coup attempt\" against Venezuela, which has been embroiled in power and fuel price disputes with United States-backed opposition party-led opposition leader Juan Guaido.\nOn Sunday, Mr Guaido called for the resignation of Mr Maduro over the crisis, alleging that the government is using its authority to \"sabotage\" the power grid as it controls power.\nTensions have risen in recent days as Mr Guaido has called for the departure of President Nicolas Maduro, and his supporters have urged the public to join them in demonstrating against the government. Several demonstrations have been held with little to no violence.","token_len":595,"entropy":[8.5133,3.3309,5.5195,5.3955,0.0057,1.5284,8.5626,0.2637,4.9276,0.0,3.4329,2.1314,0.2142,1.4659,5.3612,9.061,0.0174,4.4975,0.7889,7.9963,0.0292,6.7502,4.4747,3.328,0.2221,1.6569,2.2445,1.047,5.0559,1.1034,5.5852,1.8434,0.227,4.066,2.7174,0.5625,7.1962,1.1461,0.8632,4.2742,4.9499,4.8398,1.3055,7.9813,0.0075,3.1102,6.8952,0.0067,3.0881,1.7041,1.1111,0.0611,0.2687,14.2503,4.8926,0.7715,0.1185,4.2576,0.3787,0.0,1.8893,1.8311,4.4463,6.0332,0.058,0.5618,2.9428,0.0858,6.1128,3.7718,1.1155,6.1762,1.2337,4.3403,3.5056,7.6071,0.9047,2.5846,0.6448,2.1366,7.7507,0.8145,2.087,3.79,3.1315,2.2842,5.6562,2.9982,0.3534,0.2007,2.1185,1.3771,0.889,4.6846,2.822,6.8174,7.5293,9.4912,5.7409,1.0608,1.1431,0.1229,0.2286,3.1045,4.5274,1.2282,0.1002,4.1083,3.5567,0.0375,0.5751,2.2893,0.3065,0.513,2.3953,10.4328,2.9137,0.0001,1.0315,4.4972,0.366,6.468,3.8729,0.0063,1.8181,2.986,1.168,1.8799,0.5742,6.0947,0.0264,4.9753,4.2154,1.3828,6.3027,1.2374,0.547,0.4047,3.7836,1.177,0.2628,4.6063,2.2849,5.1248,0.0013,0.3917,7.1808,5.9921,2.8804,4.7144,1.3435,6.9646,1.2893,2.7501,1.5454,2.9577,1.2361,4.6624,1.526,2.8455,2.0438,4.012,0.0007,1.093,2.4158,0.4531,7.1207,0.1248,1.2804,5.6863,5.753,6.0693,0.5712,5.4158,3.3349,1.7826,0.3048,2.7575,1.2762,5.9768,0.622,2.0646,8.2844,6.7073,6.3923,5.5883,5.5388,5.3712,5.556,1.9857,0.3402,2.7758,4.8136,3.5181,3.4636,3.7044,3.0634,2.5866,2.1064,6.1069,1.0752,0.7722,1.5421,0.7731,2.6288,2.0811,3.9391,5.1658,5.2514,2.2862,0.5785,2.028,5.1092,4.8928,5.9498,1.1493,0.5674,7.3348,0.0152,0.0044,0.0158,0.0006,4.2127,6.2464,4.9123,0.9524,0.4528,1.4567,4.9814,0.8466,1.5167,2.875,7.0642,7.374,6.9627,1.3957,3.8401,4.9468,0.5037,0.5437,0.5656,2.1249,5.5975,1.7183,2.7362,5.8148,2.5609,0.6859,1.4256,3.6857,1.5058,2.1959,1.5825,2.6303,2.304,0.1547,3.201,5.3861,4.3854,1.1126,7.0162,3.8126,6.0109,5.0107,7.1543,1.6638,6.7173,0.9376,0.6228,0.6623,1.7906,2.5207,1.1931,2.5818,6.8994,4.6173,0.9342,0.8784,3.4518,0.0053,0.5057,7.17,0.752,1.3624,1.0455,2.584,0.4794,1.875,4.1395,0.4902,0.5989,2.5926,1.6392,2.6979,0.0008,2.0414,2.7142,6.8205,1.3171,7.0133,1.3661,1.6363,1.5253,2.0716,5.3362,3.8427,1.7532,0.132,0.0441,1.0525,0.5153,4.8073,8.1168,4.0514,7.0716,5.0241,0.0399,0.1335,5.1899,7.4043,0.318,2.8502,7.6922,2.9566,1.3227,4.4542,0.8199,0.6029,1.4347,2.4569,5.1175,11.1159,0.6463,0.004,4.5428,0.288,4.2519,5.2961,2.5185,0.2099,4.0602,0.9628,0.4266,1.5768,3.0597,0.1743,3.976,0.9927,1.4281,1.3968,6.1626,6.4195,4.1872,0.6841,4.1414,0.0081,3.9287,0.3208,3.8494,1.2843,6.3518,5.5504,0.0233,3.9002,5.5588,2.0592,0.0097,2.6842,0.6026,6.3389,5.911,2.1588,1.0295,6.7902,0.8243,8.9803,7.0083,4.9847,0.6727,1.6,3.0151,0.8196,2.2565,0.4476,1.4193,0.6523,3.781,4.279,0.0991,2.4127,1.9609,0.0108,0.4541,3.5767,2.3321,6.1997,1.81,1.1898,0.3564,4.4415,1.7246,0.3016,1.0708,0.0076,0.0,0.47,0.3298,3.0064,0.8431,0.0005,0.0002,0.6164,5.8762,3.2678,5.6099,4.5429,0.0769,1.3271,1.7513,0.1624,0.3478,2.3224,0.0026,0.9776,1.7775,1.4691,2.1485,0.0006,1.8323,0.8153,0.7889,0.1876,8.3144,3.4252,1.1993,1.3314,0.1003,0.2273,0.328,0.5631,3.3432,1.4106,3.5825,5.0325,1.0938,0.9434,6.4042,0.5889,4.8165,5.4321,1.9764,1.5193,3.1681,0.0011,1.2538,2.7828,2.4203,1.3784,0.3449,0.6834,0.2812,0.5487,2.6855,1.1198,0.0002,0.0003,4.287,2.2482,3.4679,0.0023,1.1352,0.4499,4.9287,1.1781,3.5792,0.7268,3.3892,2.1924,2.2295,1.5041,1.18,1.4295,4.7592,0.0066,6.4648,3.6042,4.4102,5.1203,2.738,1.7125,7.2174,0.0968,2.4674,1.7689,2.8834,3.9992,4.8811,1.8195,3.7235,4.4216,6.538,5.5042,19.106,0.9185,0.3359,3.1278,2.2138,0.1575,2.2637,2.3487,0.0035,3.3542,1.2725,1.7087,3.5448,0.0176,2.0467,0.0724,4.2576,0.5854,3.0803,0.9426,5.8082,0.6875,1.4018,2.3995,3.2654,2.5318,3.0549,4.433,0.3347,2.9425,4.5927,0.9214,0.0102,0.0002,0.8193,1.0789,5.1089,0.6521,4.9886,2.1831,7.0311,4.5784,2.2783,0.4211,5.4107,1.0933,1.3687,1.9758,1.4184,1.1279,1.2875,1.8949,3.2873,4.2587,0.0011,1.2373,3.0999,0.4807,1.7532,6.4244,0.0163,3.0716,0.8334,0.002,1.0433,2.9723,3.046,2.3587,0.6805,4.3249,1.7624,6.1638,0.4231,3.1695,2.0653,0.7796,5.5853,1.2381,1.1015,1.6498,0.5016,6.7888,4.5344,0.6938,0.5814,0.6734,6.0634,6.7388,3.3814,0.0974,4.2041,1.1304]}

Around 3,000 migrants attempt to reach Germany in Germany each year from 2015, a quarter of them from African countries, leaving the rest to be processed at the southern Schengen border.\nHer office also issued a statement noting that the Commission would propose new mechanisms aimed at improving the legal migration route. \u201cThese actions are based on the results of the European Commission\u2019s consultation concluded on November 21, 2015, and which concluded that a common immigration control and cooperation mechanism should be implemented,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Commission will present the proposal for adoption to the European Parliament and the Council [European Union],\u201d it added.\nDespite these statements, the European Union\u2019s commissioner of internal affairs, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, said the EU would continue to build the border in Libya, the major entry point for migrants, following the intervention of the UN-backed Libyan intervention in October.\nDespite these statements, Ms. Malmsted claimed the EU would continue to build the border in Libya, the major entry point for migrants, following the intervention of the UN-backed Libyan intervention in October.\nThis entry was posted in Immigration and tagged Frontex, refugee migration, slavery. Bookmark the permalink.\nThis is one hell of a picture with not a lot of information other than a word or phrase. The title reads \u201cThis is why\u201d. I don\u2019t know what \u201cthis is why\u201d is, but it seems to me that this is a picture of a scene. It\u2019s not necessarily an action like you would draw from life. It can be a thought or a feeling or something else. This can be an interesting subject for a painting, because we usually don\u2019t draw this sort of thing. You don\u2019t come home and think that you are really sad, and then start making this sort of picture. You draw what you experience, but you don\u2019t always draw it exactly or in sequence. I guess you could say that this is a representation of a moment, but an interpretation of what the moment was to you.","token_len":596,"entropy":[9.8851,1.7617,0.0003,3.3666,2.1499,6.1772,1.3178,2.6609,0.0127,5.9736,10.5563,1.88,9.9902,5.267,7.4856,1.3123,4.6601,8.827,0.6934,6.5088,0.6346,3.7975,0.1833,1.859,4.6267,6.0971,7.5172,3.2276,5.9881,0.2134,1.1775,3.5323,2.7747,3.4545,0.0555,0.7124,0.1265,20.9112,0.0005,13.6421,9.3601,3.2271,4.3988,4.2186,3.3018,0.2597,0.6449,6.4106,0.3816,1.6956,5.9593,2.961,5.9457,2.9105,5.6909,5.4472,0.0151,4.3131,1.0552,3.2452,5.7983,2.2535,2.5745,2.8872,2.3189,7.2565,1.8511,5.6743,1.6979,3.5703,5.3588,0.314,5.5474,5.4641,0.866,0.1956,4.4844,3.7912,3.8495,2.7206,4.1661,8.5843,0.5873,1.5311,6.739,4.4613,2.8201,4.7291,0.5406,2.2816,1.0394,0.8601,2.7461,2.3916,1.9802,5.9991,2.3028,1.5536,4.2113,0.2918,0.1706,0.0045,0.8636,2.3767,5.0266,3.9477,1.8681,1.6929,0.254,1.4372,1.3876,5.7707,7.1164,0.9477,2.1866,4.5644,2.9367,2.7682,2.9237,3.0856,0.8573,0.0121,0.0002,3.7158,8.6233,3.0861,2.0279,3.2434,4.3524,3.5754,5.9347,0.5719,4.2968,0.555,0.556,4.9238,2.1655,2.213,0.6034,1.2515,0.0056,0.6024,0.8265,0.0305,4.8469,1.1269,2.69,4.4334,0.0345,4.0554,0.6465,0.315,1.2041,2.621,0.7873,0.7055,0.1199,5.9493,2.7027,0.3634,8.8849,3.1812,0.1686,0.5107,1.4388,6.385,0.3227,1.6791,2.314,2.5591,5.6395,1.1959,0.7138,3.3415,9.4978,3.2765,4.2172,4.4557,0.0886,1.0756,1.2004,4.6437,0.5533,1.7335,6.221,2.2101,3.8061,2.916,3.1753,4.6008,2.8287,2.1942,3.661,5.9346,0.0002,0.0,1.9418,0.6207,0.3782,5.7221,1.9286,2.1754,1.5706,0.2222,0.2091,4.2925,0.1924,0.7141,0.4449,0.5022,0.1187,0.0331,0.0552,0.0196,0.0006,0.018,0.0041,0.0106,0.0076,0.0007,3.0432,6.3219,0.3632,6.3905,5.9096,1.8003,3.2313,0.0546,1.1286,6.1027,0.1282,1.5826,2.6427,0.8769,8.7388,1.1848,0.1341,4.8223,8.4362,1.6992,4.3108,3.8126,1.0135,2.0237,0.9198,1.7171,4.4594,4.4931,0.2469,3.4232,3.6629,5.2967,3.9522,4.502,6.0184,1.4176,1.6513,0.1691,2.3144,2.8045,7.4784,2.0667,3.2376,0.6381,0.732,0.0689,5.1948,0.7313,1.5743,0.4413,1.4582,4.9456,2.3555,2.8195,2.2023,6.4602,1.8173,0.2666,1.213,0.0964,1.5569,1.1131,0.1831,8.7617,5.1024,5.2306,2.8807,2.3135,2.3631,3.7612,0.8095,0.0776,0.2991,5.721,4.0064,3.6553,0.1844,1.4406,2.6131,3.0297,4.2081,1.4376,0.0153,5.9467,4.7138,4.628,0.1056,0.7527,3.881,0.002,0.0047,0.0029,0.0741,0.0011,0.0,0.5602,1.6278,2.2718,3.5627,2.2906,1.8698,0.2406,5.7922,2.9714,4.0888,4.9404,5.985,1.5447,3.5928,7.3886,6.1893,0.0303,0.6549,0.5529,1.8141,5.4917,0.8852,6.2376,0.268,1.0101,4.525,3.4857,0.6617,1.4914,6.8239,1.8647,3.1809,1.1808,0.5206,5.575,1.6355,0.696,0.0193,7.0808,1.2894,0.0569,0.0005,13.1239,10.5989,1.9805,1.656,1.4746,0.7694,0.0636,0.8702,0.1488,0.0868,0.1736,0.0317,0.4566,0.7152,0.1971,0.0219,0.0019,0.0008,0.0014,0.0164,0.1173,0.0029,0.0066,0.0012,0.0055,0.0143,0.001,0.0019,0.0219,0.0048,0.0028,0.0008,0.0297,0.4672,5.0005,6.7041,2.406,5.3422,4.3101,10.9422,1.5776,18.363,12.8468,0.5068,0.1131,2.5048,7.3718,6.0421,0.8806,8.9705,2.6936,11.8719,0.1697,2.5805,0.6851,0.0102,0.9301,1.4449,3.24,4.8425,4.5298,8.4388,0.2273,0.2032,4.72,5.775,6.5077,1.3571,3.5448,0.1801,3.6596,5.7536,0.0383,2.4119,6.9396,3.5828,2.9485,1.8143,2.8715,6.8618,4.0943,7.3595,2.8224,4.1325,1.3366,5.6562,4.8655,2.4765,3.9679,3.2873,2.8683,2.7286,5.8506,0.1541,1.2496,1.6111,4.1151,0.4985,2.9114,1.0922,7.0989,1.3324,0.3306,5.0034,2.8244,0.5145,1.7947,2.8151,1.4237,0.8456,0.6876,2.1841,0.8989,1.7837,3.3396,0.8664,1.3737,6.9418,3.4076,2.3489,2.2587,3.2754,0.0703,2.2948,5.8949,3.1851,5.5528,6.0031,3.9793,2.0737,6.996,3.2749,8.0128,1.6433,1.6112,5.4309,1.0536,1.6871,6.5944,1.6228,0.9878,2.2476,2.4592,2.6123,2.7836,0.534,3.4272,4.6638,0.6119,2.7161,5.2084,3.7981,2.4081,1.9917,8.5853,2.0921,4.2746,4.2183,4.7691,2.2664,0.3778,0.9138,0.096,2.1055,4.5351,2.597,0.003,1.5201,1.5517,4.5145,2.6782,0.1162,0.2568,0.0205,5.9596,5.8423,1.4841,2.2339,2.1998,1.2535,1.2485,5.1715,5.6245,1.8891,2.3853,2.2681,6.069,4.5182,3.8018,2.3408,0.001,2.1789,1.2382,3.0524,4.589,4.3462,0.3635,7.6453,1.6268,2.6498,1.2004,0.604,0.0433,0.0606,0.0044,4.6397,2.2576,2.3756,3.4101,6.3554,2.7589,7.3231,0.4629,2.8262,4.3655,2.147,1.6996,0.6065,0.7444,1.9527,0.4647,1.1001,5.9484,0.1664,1.5046,4.2255,1.8958,1.2696,6.9606,4.0227,1.1274,1.9322,3.4771,3.2134,2.656,5.2191,1.2045,0.5563]}
{"prompt":"The approval rating for Brazilian President Michel Temer s scandal-plagued government has doubled to 6 percent from the prior survey , a new poll published on Wednesday showed , as the country s economy continues","text":"The approval rating for Brazilian President Michel Temer s scandal-plagued government has doubled to 6 percent from the prior survey, a new poll published on Wednesday showed, as the country s economy continues to struggle with a currency crisis.\nThe poll, by pollster Macroplan, was undertaken just four days after the government banned the use of the currency called Lira, and a move that led to a dramatic fall in the lira and a sharp increase in the cost of living.The Brazilian stock market, however, has not experienced a similar fall, keeping a steady level despite the loss of confidence in the lira.In the poll, conducted in May 22 to May 26, 17 percent of the respondents responded that they were satisfied with Temer s handling of the economy, and 37 percent said they were dissatisfied. Temer took office in January. He was sworn in amid a scandal at his government, linked to his wife, for allegedly receiving kickbacks through his state-employee father, who worked in a private firm hired by a state company.The scandal has since been linked more directly to Temer and his wife, Joesley Batista, a tycoon who founded the meat processing company JBS, which is a major player in the Brazilian economy.The corruption scandal has also hit Temer s approval rating, which in the four days that followed the scandal dropped seven percent, from 45 percent to 35 percent.The poll also showed that 37 percent of Brazilians were dissatisfied with Temer s handling of the economy, versus 18 percent who indicated a positive response, Macroplan said.Asked how Temer is handling his administration, 16 percent of respondents said well, and 21 percent said they were not interested. A third option, not sure, received 24 percent of the votes.However, the poll found that 55 percent of Brazilians trust him as president. Macroplan said it is impossible to know for sure how much of the country s support for Temer s presidency is due to his reputation or his scandal involving his family.The poll also asked about the approval of other public authorities.

The UN has refused to comment on whether Syrian government troops have tried to push back the rebels from eastern Damascus.\nUN officials, however, said that they had been told of heavy opposition fire at the presidential palace in Damascus and that security forces had also fired on civilians.\nThe rebels have attacked hospitals and also accused Syria of using chemical weapons.\nMr Mladenov said Damascus wanted the rebels to disarm its artillery in Duma, a proposal the UN rejected. \" If the rebels did not agree in that regard, then the humanitarian crisis would remain unbearable and the situation we see now in the region would be worse, \" he said.\nMeanwhile, Damascus continues to claim that the rebels were responsible for a massacre near Damascus in which the security services had shot at a group of students and left five of them unharmed.\nThe rebels had claimed the students had fired at Syrian military vehicles in northern Damascus. But a video footage, which was shared on social media and seen by the BBC, shows the students being shot at by unknown assailants. Some of the victims, seen on the video, were in shock and had injuries to the face.","token_len":596,"entropy":[6.9248,2.5412,5.5178,1.0852,5.6247,2.7315,2.3435,1.9266,0.0783,4.3531,9.4995,2.586,8.1605,2.1296,0.1319,7.3028,1.9687,2.6343,1.3583,9.2138,0.3048,0.3248,1.4135,5.2441,5.6446,0.01,0.0,1.1105,5.8681,1.4619,6.8448,5.8928,1.3926,2.7969,5.024,1.0817,0.811,6.6522,1.1671,0.5105,0.1727,14.0776,2.9615,0.0703,4.2186,7.0187,1.6967,1.337,1.4683,4.0769,7.0595,6.4114,2.3372,1.5965,2.5097,6.7361,3.7857,1.6307,1.1604,3.6672,1.1271,5.6023,1.4139,0.3643,7.3257,3.4308,3.8544,2.181,2.961,6.3302,4.0681,3.9101,2.9747,1.9296,0.979,3.9708,4.5266,0.0026,1.1489,0.1933,1.4282,2.3078,1.5518,6.6687,2.0383,4.0602,0.0164,3.9855,9.098,1.1998,2.7149,2.958,3.5464,1.6841,1.6565,1.2996,2.7787,2.3334,4.31,0.5719,3.171,0.3681,0.9149,0.9943,1.8128,7.3115,2.9379,3.91,2.7638,0.4455,3.8498,0.0025,0.5852,1.6576,1.0217,0.3436,0.3381,0.4523,3.3757,10.2386,1.0237,5.04,0.5492,5.895,2.6596,7.7968,4.6342,0.9315,3.1307,2.6778,2.7115,0.0929,0.0004,0.0004,2.8738,3.8012,0.2505,1.8514,2.9794,1.5339,0.6653,1.4024,1.6054,5.8798,2.2408,3.9721,2.1983,3.0259,6.1397,0.013,0.5408,1.7,3.4584,0.0464,4.0017,1.3602,2.9754,3.1472,1.4321,1.4703,4.7741,4.2272,3.2247,2.8054,0.6349,4.5793,0.1306,0.0794,1.1588,0.278,0.543,4.6259,3.4657,4.6134,4.803,2.483,1.1766,2.7981,0.6688,3.8716,0.819,0.4044,3.7637,6.4796,0.0796,5.1651,0.0492,2.1864,1.4593,1.132,0.2364,0.3196,2.2315,2.7388,1.4866,5.1681,1.2102,4.4041,1.6391,7.2237,3.5678,3.0424,1.0843,1.5876,2.6347,2.3332,1.3536,3.7362,1.4059,3.5653,0.6557,1.2516,4.5254,0.2551,0.1853,4.9612,0.0007,0.0009,0.6517,1.3563,3.3411,2.2179,5.4943,1.3073,0.7284,12.9162,3.7121,8.5322,3.1931,1.1489,4.3324,1.2871,1.7984,3.6331,1.6441,3.2493,4.5224,3.779,1.9546,3.9204,4.1864,0.4272,5.6095,1.6488,3.3418,0.0074,1.4672,3.2596,3.7254,5.583,2.8059,3.0899,2.7913,5.4106,5.8526,0.8436,0.4268,1.0015,1.3251,5.2441,3.498,4.0915,5.783,3.5653,7.6394,2.8389,1.5793,1.9022,7.5683,0.9112,4.9496,5.7295,2.2435,5.5253,0.3967,0.1054,1.4307,3.3597,0.0598,2.2602,2.0346,2.7802,3.2794,3.0846,6.5785,0.0085,5.3589,1.0539,15.6819,0.6135,5.353,1.4774,0.0259,0.6277,1.0403,0.3624,2.6915,0.8331,3.9156,5.9123,4.1354,3.8285,0.9772,3.3694,1.2436,3.3994,0.7026,0.5937,2.031,6.7748,3.6948,3.2969,0.1048,0.0537,0.0168,3.5107,0.8523,3.4663,1.9629,0.2564,1.3141,4.1154,0.05,1.4507,3.2992,1.2997,0.9309,2.0495,2.9453,5.514,1.4878,0.0236,1.7335,5.3993,0.166,3.9897,5.523,6.5417,2.6357,4.6808,7.6652,0.0283,0.5124,0.6729,4.9831,0.1145,1.2187,5.5166,4.4918,0.575,2.2604,0.3064,0.7242,0.3096,3.4844,3.8688,2.8982,2.5721,6.3084,0.0175,1.1616,4.4519,3.6105,5.5009,1.8161,2.4344,1.7692,2.1449,4.6523,0.1941,5.352,0.3216,2.3376,4.5063,1.6386,1.7659,1.3024,6.4117,0.1152,5.6922,2.4252,1.1739,0.926,3.1169,3.6155,3.183,0.6105,0.6367,4.7021,2.5279,4.1367,1.7559,0.0012,1.5529,1.6594,2.6137,1.1267,2.5454,2.0089,3.3302,6.6093,6.1892,3.7572,3.7894,0.9977,7.3375,0.3534,1.3262,0.8892,1.9464,1.1293,6.0234,0.284,0.8338,3.2228,3.1951,1.5434,2.8955,1.2875,0.6254,1.4487,3.0349,1.7074,5.1493,3.7622,1.2053,5.2449,5.7604,6.0396,1.3863,2.1705,0.8581,0.0241,0.9735,1.1092,5.3805,1.3764,0.0207,0.0014,0.4414,4.9904,6.7598,2.4574,3.0058,0.2415,5.1855,4.1204,6.4317,4.1358,2.9224,0.0027,1.227,3.2193,9.1556,2.1159,1.7376,2.9988,0.7612,1.8628,5.4193,1.4627,1.4244,3.4303,0.2579,5.2494,5.7274,4.8223,1.5547,0.3846,1.5448,1.7893,6.4994,2.7304,1.4724,5.3231,5.1653,2.4359,1.8784,1.9279,6.8103,2.9196,1.7678,2.4706,1.7251,4.7595,0.5746,1.3769,3.4434,3.7158,1.2841,0.2139,0.1702,0.0885,0.422,5.5405,0.2025,5.4728,6.5407,0.2281,4.4076,1.4841,1.8885,1.7346,3.1824,1.2386,0.0225,2.6115,3.6531,5.6958,1.8851,2.7386,2.0823,4.1911,4.3919,3.8475,3.0618,3.4112,2.7401,1.9135,2.7327,0.0951,5.2132,2.1748,6.8481,4.0006,3.8628,0.1887,7.4523,0.0694,0.0,0.2004,0.6448,1.4465,2.6935,3.9556,2.0407,3.1023,2.5943,1.2421,5.0115,1.6729,4.5556,3.3028,2.2082,2.6567,5.4062,0.979,1.4702,2.8506,2.8325,3.6672,4.9157,4.4635,2.3973,1.6036,3.3261,0.8037,0.5097,0.0537,2.981,4.9784,0.0848,2.7151,2.6777,0.3256,1.2813,2.0292,2.6409,1.7227,1.0952,3.0454,1.462,6.2827,1.4234,0.4686,5.4485,1.2226,0.2066,3.9573,2.5351,5.8995,2.9153,0.7122,0.4508,0.8876,1.2649,3.7398,6.4347,1.3099,3.945,4.6542,2.1873,2.5549,2.286,1.5773]}
{"prompt":"U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has divested his interests in oil tanker company Diamond S Shipping and is in the process of selling off his holdings in another shipping firm , Navigator Holdings , a","text":"U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has divested his interests in oil tanker company Diamond S Shipping and is in the process of selling off his holdings in another shipping firm, Navigator Holdings, a source familiar with the matter said.\nRoss had been considering divesting or selling some of his shares in Diamond S, the world's largest crude oil tanker, and other holdings since July, the source said, asking not to be named because the move is private.\nThe source, who was privy to Ross' discussions with the Trump administration said Ross was trying to raise money to sell the shipping empire.\nRoss told employees and customers he wanted to find a buyer and sell the company, the source said.\nThe source said when Ross and his company became aware that the U.S. Embassy in Iraq was taking legal action to seize the oil tankers it previously financed, it became apparent that it was going to take an aggressive position on the oil tankers it financed.\n\"Then they (the Embassy) decided to take legal action, because that's the game they play,\" the source said.\nRoss has long fought to protect the oil tankers it financed amid increasing pressure from oil companies and foreign governments to keep them afloat. In March, he wrote to the acting U.S. ambassador to Iraq pleading to protect ships of his company, including the Arctic Sunrise, from being raided by the Iraqi military. Ross said he feared the seizure could trigger a security and diplomatic incident.\nAfter U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized the White House for not intervening, the Embassy made clear its decision had been final. But several days later, Ross had to publicly defend his decision when a Trump official suggested the action by the White House had been unfriendly.\n\"If the United States were to take any action whatsoever to try and keep any of the tankers afloat, we believe that it would certainly be unfriendly to the United States to say that that would trigger some kind of diplomatic response,\" the official told reporters on Capitol Hill.\nIn April, he wrote to the director of the office in charge of military intelligence in the U.S. Embassy, informing him the U.S. would be taking legal action against the Embassy's actions to seize the Arctic Sunrise amid a growing backlash.\nRoss said the oil tanker had been used to steal oil in Iraq by supporting the Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr who heads one of the country's largest militias. His letter was seen by the Wall Street Journal as a move to deflect criticism of the ship and his company.\nRoss, who is also a former U.S. Energy Secretary under President Barack Obama, now has two oil tankers in his ownership that he will not publicly list due to ongoing legal battles.\nRoss said, \"I'll give them an update next week and then we'll see what kind of story they want to have.\"","token_len":596,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,7.2578,1.8145,0.1634,0.0112,0.0007,3.4002,10.3269,0.0566,1.7662,5.7704,0.6739,5.665,8.4912,3.1719,10.133,5.7097,11.4703,2.2718,2.6804,4.2713,1.3818,0.1889,0.0072,2.0382,1.611,1.2994,2.6835,0.7282,5.6234,5.3357,2.2195,1.121,6.6002,1.849,3.394,1.2271,2.8791,3.6856,1.0694,0.0011,0.1991,1.4299,0.6912,0.2598,0.4105,25.682,4.3153,1.478,3.972,6.0933,0.0011,7.1415,1.761,3.7846,0.3375,0.1739,3.3246,0.7011,1.6516,0.0698,1.4229,1.1339,7.6917,0.0072,0.7029,4.1822,0.7025,1.0115,1.4179,2.8172,3.8638,4.5971,5.1019,3.7629,1.1412,1.3557,0.3119,0.136,2.4096,6.7714,0.153,0.0046,0.0094,1.6533,0.4009,1.2292,4.0181,1.5852,3.4563,0.1939,0.4416,9.7465,3.5578,2.4411,0.4387,3.0521,7.0376,0.0029,0.0003,5.0717,0.2929,1.4175,0.6558,2.209,3.7005,1.3507,9.5341,1.2637,1.9121,4.3084,0.0415,5.3099,1.4745,1.2449,3.9107,2.7275,7.0129,5.465,1.4947,0.6904,2.5404,4.5876,5.3913,3.8671,3.8849,2.5218,3.2273,0.2565,6.071,1.0443,0.6484,2.352,2.3705,1.3852,1.7322,1.361,1.2185,0.1155,0.0776,0.3042,0.7216,1.9746,1.9626,0.6573,7.5241,0.8672,3.8913,2.3844,2.8918,5.2885,0.8634,2.3628,1.9534,3.3447,0.001,0.0018,0.0041,7.1164,0.4558,6.9161,0.5848,4.6964,4.6326,0.0305,3.1394,3.6245,1.5969,2.562,4.0453,0.054,4.461,7.5917,8.0703,0.3178,3.5756,3.9133,3.5506,0.8502,3.4279,0.5734,4.2586,0.0991,2.2865,3.9555,0.9844,2.5561,2.7906,0.9877,2.3969,3.7978,0.0658,3.9541,4.3007,0.4486,0.2998,1.985,6.5715,2.2839,5.7053,0.7896,4.0954,0.1162,2.7854,0.5545,1.7093,2.7503,0.0162,2.8185,3.4541,3.1798,0.96,2.267,7.0003,1.1988,2.073,0.7445,0.1467,0.1299,0.0617,0.0689,0.4315,1.2806,2.6057,4.5285,5.1918,1.4796,2.7112,1.2038,1.6103,1.4348,0.0272,3.8777,0.9714,7.7799,5.3504,2.7338,0.3626,4.0444,0.8912,1.978,4.5664,0.5345,0.7755,4.6821,2.0783,3.8244,0.5659,3.2112,3.2404,0.187,1.3957,4.3474,1.706,1.4544,7.1102,1.6151,0.0004,0.027,0.0011,1.1442,0.6166,0.3135,7.0519,2.7901,3.5732,7.495,4.7718,2.9356,0.8472,1.29,5.512,1.3428,8.9541,4.0594,0.8905,2.1999,2.3185,4.3745,0.3908,1.4133,1.7622,2.0092,0.5727,3.248,2.3857,0.8321,5.4202,1.2934,5.1694,2.4676,3.9868,1.0651,6.0175,5.6252,2.7333,4.5036,0.823,0.1414,4.1454,3.9133,0.0003,0.0027,0.0293,4.0868,0.0036,0.0266,7.7546,0.2096,0.0004,5.1862,1.7066,4.6906,0.0006,0.6461,2.0921,4.3215,3.1625,2.891,6.1002,5.4179,3.4295,3.3719,3.7208,4.1719,1.3259,6.0169,0.4787,4.7978,6.1729,4.7258,0.4877,0.2426,1.3308,4.5867,2.8583,5.7285,2.8399,1.0021,1.4871,4.9877,2.3968,4.9792,3.7539,4.7077,2.0257,5.6987,4.2228,0.834,2.8541,0.0027,3.0792,0.6957,9.3222,0.2681,0.0004,0.9278,0.2604,1.5976,3.8973,2.087,3.1388,0.0041,2.9217,0.5644,2.5954,2.5279,0.3787,3.5927,1.9556,5.124,0.8872,4.5,4.5362,1.1003,1.3915,3.8769,0.017,3.9976,0.5178,2.099,4.3619,1.0902,2.3027,0.2167,5.8665,0.7635,5.9923,0.0139,0.0134,0.8296,1.0582,0.6549,0.0038,3.7375,6.7049,1.2148,4.0281,1.1858,8.6539,4.9279,0.6748,0.0014,2.7499,4.5341,0.6499,1.2734,1.4371,1.5699,2.3546,2.7796,3.8715,0.0036,0.4477,0.3157,3.3006,3.9901,0.0475,4.279,2.7437,0.594,1.056,4.642,0.0368,0.5606,6.3567,6.1998,0.7856,0.0025,4.2706,4.0153,2.47,1.8116,2.4269,0.0005,0.0112,0.3459,3.0197,2.6274,4.5902,0.3552,2.81,1.7482,0.0004,0.0019,0.0017,2.6615,1.6763,2.0758,1.5011,0.0721,1.1203,1.6557,4.5835,3.9039,4.6798,4.3278,4.4357,0.4686,5.5796,0.0445,9.4104,2.6554,1.9211,4.6317,2.7054,0.4808,1.4317,2.3124,1.9783,4.6799,0.896,5.283,1.0095,4.3518,1.0707,6.7733,2.5167,3.9868,0.883,3.8772,7.8357,1.6468,5.0089,0.1882,0.0322,4.6161,2.0783,0.012,0.0007,0.0067,0.0421,0.0001,0.0002,3.8734,5.9289,4.9021,0.0211,0.4627,3.0323,0.0005,2.2945,3.8051,0.7555,5.045,6.2407,2.7235,4.1412,0.4247,2.3242,4.1289,0.0014,0.0008,0.3211,0.7108,4.6762,0.5976,5.4464,1.8916,1.0536,0.8622,5.7936,2.8783,2.9559,2.1367,1.3185,0.243,1.7073,2.3523,0.7336,2.0389,2.5232,1.14,1.8689,2.4838,0.0003,0.0103,0.0012,6.673,1.0919,1.5582,0.6986,2.3264,0.0018,0.1473,5.7901,2.8406,4.2836,4.7412,2.35,0.0529,1.423,1.7302,5.6655,3.8092,1.0066,4.8637,3.2434,4.6865,4.9807,6.3909,0.0035,4.8562,1.0094,1.7991,0.7656,0.8274,2.3802,2.2786,5.8017,0.5257,0.971,5.0586,4.2856,2.5541,4.1443,3.4022,4.9748,0.3066,2.8735,2.4251,2.0624,0.1714,1.5233,0.9736,4.541,0.0015,6.8453,1.1586,2.4004,0.1403,3.0904,1.1425]}
{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his threat to scrap NAFTA and ripped on trading partners Canada and Mexico in a tweet early on Sunday , days before the three countries were scheduled to hold a","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his threat to scrap NAFTA and ripped on trading partners Canada and Mexico in a tweet early on Sunday, days before the three countries were scheduled to hold a summit on the North-American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nPresident Trump also said that North American free trade deal isn\u2019t working so we must get rid of it. We have to replace it with something REAL.\nOn May 1, Trump tweeted that NAFTA is \u201cbroken and has no business being in existence at all,\u201d and that the world must get rid of the pact. The deal has been an important source of U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada, and Trump has sought protectionism and nationalism \u2013 including the possibility of pulling the U.S. out of the International Monetary Fund \u2013 as a way to boost domestic jobs.\nHe later issued a tweet that Canada was \u201cbehaving very foolishly\u201d after the U.S. accused it of taking unfair advantage of the trade deal.\nTrump and his allies have repeatedly said that NAFTA is unfair to the United States. A report by Business Insider in 2010 found that manufacturing in the U.S. fell by $18.7 billion from 2003 to 2007, and that it contributed 2.5% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Mexico also faced a decline in manufacturing industries.\nOne of the first questions for the three countries is whether they can find a way to avoid a trade war.\nTrump on Sunday said he does not want to find a new free trade deal with trade partners Canada and Mexico. If the trade wars escalate, Trump said, he would take unilateral action. Canada and Mexico have made several attempts to revive the NAFTA trade deal in recent months, but only by promising to work on certain issues in the hopes that the president will back down.\nWe do not need a new NAFTA! We have NAFTA already and it is much better for the United States and our NAFTA trading partners. We now have a new deal! The U.S. is already doing very well, thanks to the protectionism of China as well as our NAFTA partners! #KeepAmericaGreat\nThis is the last line and this is the final opportunity for a better new NAFTA! NAFTA has not produced high-wage, high-skilled jobs for our citizens. I want to show my opposition to NAFTA again! The U.S. is now doing very well, thanks to my protectionism combined with the protectionism practiced by my NAFTA trading partners. We don\u2019t have to let another NAFTA deal fail \u2026 we must keep America Great, in every way!\nTrump said his NAFTA opponents were trying to \u201cdestroy America\u201d and that Mexico and Canada were \u201cplaying hardball.\u201d But Trump has been open about his frustration with U.S. trade officials and economic policymakers who are seen by the president as weak in their work on NAFTA.","token_len":597,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,9.9224,0.9663,3.4005,0.8071,5.9772,4.3372,3.0827,9.2719,6.2204,8.9635,1.0578,3.5161,0.3819,0.0209,3.3038,0.5365,2.9861,4.5055,2.9349,2.3691,1.9975,7.1075,1.1742,1.1936,5.5177,0.943,2.9032,0.7904,0.0195,2.8013,0.7673,1.9016,1.9657,1.4988,1.9158,5.9631,3.0196,0.019,0.0,0.0034,1.5854,0.0029,0.0,0.0,0.3122,0.1037,21.8714,0.6415,3.8532,2.4756,2.0396,4.6151,2.7003,5.3049,0.0296,4.3514,6.8878,16.6464,8.5171,1.5829,3.3296,4.9167,5.2544,2.1861,3.12,1.7768,0.0084,0.8493,0.73,5.5382,2.6916,1.1536,6.3973,0.4631,0.761,1.152,8.2241,1.1577,3.8328,4.8847,4.6465,3.2988,0.2383,2.0437,1.8034,1.2298,2.1292,1.6746,10.5187,3.9068,8.4671,1.878,3.9499,2.967,4.81,1.8348,0.5288,4.5424,4.5996,0.1126,2.8846,3.0944,7.9332,2.0899,1.3307,2.2829,4.3434,1.7854,2.5802,1.1989,0.0036,2.3992,5.5039,0.7264,3.1686,5.6313,2.9804,1.1556,4.5077,3.0274,3.4409,0.0262,3.7327,0.0028,0.0008,0.0995,3.4671,0.7395,1.6279,1.4685,0.8776,1.016,1.0953,3.0998,2.0455,5.2077,7.3038,2.839,3.1312,6.1099,7.8658,4.4218,2.2583,5.1735,0.2442,5.2409,2.5892,0.6314,0.0005,0.0082,0.0644,0.036,0.0686,0.4957,6.3065,0.8428,0.0007,3.5828,2.3109,1.4026,0.7509,0.1765,3.0431,4.5486,4.8821,0.5642,0.3721,4.6457,4.2047,4.3169,0.4478,2.2222,1.8927,9.6583,2.8032,5.356,0.4801,10.373,0.1086,4.3645,5.774,0.2387,0.7555,2.6554,5.478,2.0039,1.3202,0.0005,0.0413,0.0242,6.4404,3.0364,0.0329,4.8013,3.3023,0.8353,0.0154,1.8512,3.379,1.2734,0.7195,0.6896,2.4399,4.2677,1.8768,1.742,1.4304,2.6405,2.5219,0.3578,1.2119,0.626,4.6438,2.3187,1.9851,1.2083,0.0011,1.6727,4.4219,3.8437,1.68,5.2873,0.1752,2.3912,5.9099,1.4244,0.0659,6.7292,2.2733,0.5912,0.8294,0.0004,0.0006,0.0954,3.8315,0.7179,3.7352,4.8493,0.9168,2.0871,0.1356,2.8124,3.7087,0.19,2.5551,0.752,1.3418,0.8972,3.7153,4.5023,6.5241,0.3101,1.6854,2.2457,0.8343,1.4553,2.2007,8.4728,1.2183,3.1927,1.062,0.0311,0.0015,0.7685,5.2773,3.3268,5.6121,1.6109,3.9989,0.8008,1.5864,7.1414,2.5063,0.524,5.5372,0.7591,0.4389,4.4453,3.9556,3.8916,1.7474,6.5116,0.9536,1.8989,0.7728,1.5366,2.5732,4.6038,1.329,0.8336,0.1072,4.1447,2.3895,1.3952,0.3309,1.1237,1.2921,2.6794,4.5149,1.7938,1.5998,2.4853,4.022,0.1602,1.754,0.5644,6.3045,0.7648,3.8402,5.2326,0.0707,0.5172,1.8388,7.1332,0.2375,3.1987,0.3299,0.0371,0.8504,5.6871,1.9061,4.5553,6.3293,5.7642,0.5972,2.3831,1.0425,0.6442,2.1073,1.3907,4.2132,3.4287,0.1932,2.0326,5.1887,1.0001,0.0503,1.6918,4.5681,4.8065,1.8154,0.3873,5.7417,1.636,1.3269,3.1322,0.9693,2.8964,0.6786,1.3132,0.6426,0.8132,4.4994,4.7599,5.1717,0.6786,3.6461,3.3049,6.8031,2.069,3.3207,1.0052,8.0812,1.3225,1.991,5.2478,1.2374,3.2215,3.2469,0.5913,0.3794,6.6286,4.0277,0.5446,2.6897,1.4682,0.8788,0.9549,5.4305,1.437,2.1283,5.2461,5.3394,4.164,1.6916,0.9954,6.7287,0.7777,4.1285,1.5198,1.6499,0.0027,2.6833,2.0393,4.9147,6.229,0.0328,1.3247,2.5645,5.3308,0.4155,1.1632,2.3206,2.3143,1.8502,4.686,2.4917,0.0035,0.0068,0.0474,2.2508,4.9059,3.0533,2.9228,0.4432,2.6192,5.153,0.4005,2.0661,6.6484,0.7893,1.7674,5.0066,6.5508,0.407,0.1864,2.7417,3.6181,0.4641,1.2465,4.6318,6.2699,3.2636,2.8039,3.5649,4.3328,2.6619,2.227,5.0243,5.5199,6.3838,4.5284,0.6857,1.0239,2.8037,7.3097,0.7156,3.3851,6.1915,7.3981,0.9894,2.2256,4.2366,2.8697,3.7519,6.0052,5.4604,1.0507,1.7577,2.4975,1.0983,0.0406,1.5991,0.5916,1.8053,3.3927,3.6945,1.2676,5.1726,2.4553,0.6411,4.9011,3.2115,5.6354,0.2042,1.2063,5.8558,1.8246,3.5117,1.8813,0.001,0.0035,0.03,1.6532,3.6236,2.1897,0.3544,0.0959,0.6567,0.0682,0.0035,6.295,4.2844,0.306,9.0433,0.0077,2.0945,0.8925,0.2854,10.4294,0.1158,3.4366,2.1766,6.7431,0.0399,0.8982,2.1862,4.4922,4.7037,1.5866,0.0104,2.5062,1.1755,4.9702,4.5058,1.406,3.9276,2.6977,7.8966,2.1734,3.0201,2.8902,2.0293,2.4071,3.3635,4.7471,3.827,0.8518,1.7191,0.8497,2.4748,2.7189,3.8335,4.8853,4.4309,2.4886,3.1324,0.0176,11.6014,0.97,2.75,3.4619,1.1107,5.4991,1.3349,1.4824,3.5104,1.7018,0.1101,1.533,5.6091,0.0754,3.4726,3.8717,0.0339,0.9905,7.2226,2.5444,4.1606,1.9709,3.2827,3.1508,5.5084,0.7469,0.7054,5.0289,0.3595,3.8253,0.0005,0.0008,0.0948,1.682,5.0274,1.7371,6.1091,6.7681,2.9937,2.109,7.4332,3.2911,2.2367,4.5901,0.1713,3.0869,3.4753,1.2118,3.6205,1.6994,1.698,0.2536]}

(REUTERS\/David Gray)Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney on Monday insisted his country needed a fresh election after an uproar after the final count put Sinn Feinn s Fianna F\u00e1il Party at risk of losing a European mandate.\nIn its long history the Irish parliament has been dissolved on two occasions \u2013 just before an election and in the run-up to an election -, a time when the incumbent party did not necessarily lose power.\nOn that occasion the incumbent Fianna F\u00e1il s Brian Cowen lost the next election by an embarrassing defeat in 2010.\nThe Fianna F\u00e1il \u2013 or Fine Gael as it is known in the UK \u2013 has had 16 previous governments, the longest being in 1979 and the shortest in 2007 when Taoiseach Bertie Ahern resigned immediately after he was handed a humiliating defeat by the Socialist opposition.\nThe opposition Labour Party has had six national governments while the Independent and Green Parties have each had one.\nIn this election, Dublin elected 15 independents, including Sinn Fein s former leader Gerry Adams.\nWhile Sinn Fein remained the most popular force, winning 15.7 per cent of the vote, the party s number one vote was down from 27 per cent three years ago when the party was still in a coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il at the helm, a split that has been central to the political crisis.\nMeanwhile Fine Gael\u2019s vote rose slightly from 17.8 per cent to 17.9 per cent while Labour s support fell to a low of 11.3 per cent, the lowest for the party for almost 10 years.\nThe Green Party got 9.3 per cent while the Independent, which emerged from disintegration of the Conservative-led party in 2016, gained 1.8 per cent of the vote.\nThe party which had the largest vote (22.7 per cent) after the election was Alliance for Fairness and Democracy, a split off the SDLP. The Independent list of candidates also won a seat on Dublin City Council. That effectively put Sinn Fein into a minority government, even with one of its most senior leaders, Liam Howie, taking control of the executive and acting Taoiseach.\nIn the EU elections on Sunday, the last of a three-cornered race to replace Britain s exit from the 27-nation union, Sinn Fein did very poorly, winning just 3.4 per cent.\nAfter the election the government and party s main opponents, Fine Gael and Labour, each called on Sinn Fein to stand down.","token_len":597,"entropy":[8.3683,11.1542,1.8677,0.0154,14.1439,2.4166,1.0008,2.0501,3.2073,2.2831,7.2316,2.0874,1.4898,2.0505,1.9179,1.8858,3.8472,1.5045,0.5287,0.0054,1.2992,3.8446,0.0695,2.6191,2.416,4.3497,1.9571,3.3939,3.0809,3.531,0.0137,6.7535,8.5989,7.8051,3.7079,2.1067,1.3989,0.9776,7.9637,10.9014,4.1298,3.6354,0.7449,1.6085,1.8015,5.0161,7.1828,0.2549,0.6017,14.3195,5.4698,1.2628,2.3154,0.7555,1.1813,0.7504,7.1222,0.3095,0.7782,8.8043,1.9402,0.3191,3.5287,1.4154,2.0595,0.206,0.2723,1.0557,0.6414,1.3943,0.3247,0.793,3.643,3.5407,0.0127,2.812,0.032,6.0154,2.8744,0.083,0.0784,3.8612,2.3197,0.1379,12.8317,2.6269,0.0326,0.0007,10.0733,0.0068,0.0,0.0,3.8122,0.7769,4.029,3.0495,3.233,5.0829,1.8033,3.5152,1.9435,2.2091,3.6084,6.1639,3.8759,1.661,5.3058,4.2051,5.3548,5.531,10.3183,5.4977,7.0145,7.2777,0.0075,0.002,0.1802,0.0044,0.0005,4.6418,2.7289,4.8205,0.3326,1.4325,2.5473,7.3549,4.6797,0.6543,0.0555,13.0972,4.9851,6.302,2.293,4.1986,2.4797,3.1501,0.2499,1.9044,6.1319,3.8398,4.6535,0.2306,4.5498,5.9944,1.8147,4.6394,0.3803,2.5282,2.661,1.9941,4.2212,0.252,0.0277,0.0083,2.6315,0.7556,6.1108,8.6513,4.5679,5.1927,0.3558,1.4111,6.243,1.0887,5.4131,0.3419,6.452,5.5216,3.3957,0.7117,0.4719,3.646,5.4617,0.1328,1.6874,4.9177,4.2462,0.0053,0.0068,0.0641,0.0061,0.0002,6.8674,9.9143,2.4842,0.024,4.5827,1.6797,4.0939,0.6975,2.6033,3.8683,7.6085,8.9501,2.5944,4.9619,0.826,0.5813,2.32,3.1516,0.0058,0.0042,0.0698,0.0041,0.0011,7.4532,4.1284,3.5089,0.0001,2.3823,0.3309,0.3436,0.6273,1.0273,1.4302,2.9213,0.145,1.959,4.1371,6.7288,5.2841,4.7186,2.2081,3.3844,2.1428,3.495,2.0524,4.799,2.6325,1.6622,4.7328,1.6287,6.07,2.5722,3.8658,0.0005,0.0,7.2531,0.0008,0.0118,0.0001,2.2742,6.0906,0.2913,3.1886,0.9701,6.2138,1.5845,7.7497,2.18,1.6485,1.6378,5.239,5.5772,0.6953,0.1758,2.0318,5.9658,4.6633,0.5776,1.963,3.5149,3.7156,6.7286,1.8302,5.9921,0.8889,3.99,3.4116,2.5866,4.7341,0.3706,4.4356,1.0986,2.7454,0.9439,0.3688,2.4658,4.6042,1.7351,1.2204,7.2761,6.4441,6.9265,5.6322,1.327,3.6344,4.2964,0.8016,4.6722,3.876,2.2804,1.1989,0.0025,1.6815,0.8042,5.0401,2.3959,0.3646,5.8745,2.0159,2.2664,1.0925,5.3103,1.5847,8.7033,4.4808,2.4969,2.7143,0.8944,0.0002,0.1433,0.1033,0.0746,0.8547,1.3011,2.6201,6.441,7.3279,2.5342,2.5252,1.8123,2.8044,1.6766,4.4499,1.736,0.0004,4.5904,0.3823,0.1771,2.0773,1.3898,1.8122,1.7609,3.9364,1.7778,4.7921,2.7552,0.4245,3.5964,0.0018,0.0031,0.1603,0.006,0.0002,4.8416,0.856,3.0089,3.5912,3.3781,6.2348,0.6685,2.2835,2.8103,7.8898,0.1242,0.6172,3.7102,4.1742,1.025,0.1467,6.3182,3.1806,0.001,14.1353,9.2194,0.777,4.0979,3.8214,4.658,2.3024,3.6185,0.3639,2.3125,0.105,0.0004,0.672,2.4856,0.0348,2.3337,0.0376,0.0002,4.1701,3.1737,2.2214,4.2139,1.8669,1.9172,3.5786,1.9404,0.0547,2.8406,0.2361,2.1512,0.0122,0.0003,2.6106,2.457,0.3701,4.0433,1.611,0.3541,3.5074,3.5164,3.9,0.0592,0.2103,0.2233,1.8318,7.0237,0.2576,6.6106,4.5922,0.0609,2.0642,0.0594,0.0005,3.4682,1.2496,1.8537,3.4739,2.052,6.1502,1.5079,10.3175,0.7998,3.1464,0.5733,6.001,4.5976,1.6731,3.3007,1.3673,5.9503,0.3521,3.2845,2.48,0.0343,2.2957,0.0357,0.0004,3.3307,0.1886,0.0367,0.4065,0.2958,1.7271,3.5036,5.7822,2.8474,2.4547,1.9845,3.3969,6.6326,4.8837,0.183,2.2717,0.1014,0.0004,0.1503,5.3658,1.0632,1.9519,0.7412,5.8317,3.9899,4.9392,2.9415,1.9717,3.0548,1.4053,3.0137,7.6484,8.9062,2.4395,5.1554,0.0129,1.9705,2.6619,3.4406,9.6147,1.5717,1.8259,4.4193,6.1074,2.7725,3.5078,2.8388,3.9904,2.1296,0.0697,1.0386,6.6238,7.185,2.906,2.143,0.415,3.6666,1.8604,2.5188,0.5233,2.26,5.4067,3.162,5.3868,0.8842,0.5754,2.5226,1.9391,2.8189,1.4387,6.3819,6.5786,7.3723,0.5699,4.8291,4.4761,0.6075,0.4306,5.4184,2.9156,5.4987,7.2563,0.001,0.0013,0.4998,0.1553,3.1313,1.5484,6.8122,4.1396,2.9998,2.2481,0.5159,1.2424,5.9717,3.2202,4.5421,2.689,0.2147,9.8216,0.2094,0.0029,6.3503,2.8726,2.5548,7.5059,7.1862,6.2801,0.2186,0.0353,6.038,0.3759,0.3044,4.5532,0.5613,2.13,0.2428,5.1295,5.3688,2.1875,1.8083,2.2746,1.0303,3.3022,0.1075,2.1982,0.0481,0.0003,2.9226,0.6334,5.1649,1.3268,2.1437,2.5962,3.9215,4.9912,4.0346,2.5659,7.0489,3.1368,1.8034,1.8353,0.0021,1.2892,1.4195,0.2415,4.3541,5.6574,2.6315,3.6804,0.0775,0.3035,4.0102,0.5967,0.9222]}

{"prompt":"Two Reuters journalists detained in Myanmar will be allowed to meet their families once their first 14-day period of remand expires , according to local media reports . Reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo","text":"Two Reuters journalists detained in Myanmar will be allowed to meet their families once their first 14-day period of remand expires, according to local media reports. Reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested on Feb. 3 on charges of violating the country's Criminal Law on Insulting the State and National Unity and Defaming the State, which can carry up to 10 years in prison. In a statement, the country's official State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi praised the journalists for their \"enormous sacrifice.\" \"We stand against the criminal charges brought against them,\" she said in the statement.\nA United Nations Development Program report shows that global poverty rates rose sharply in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic sent economies contracting and thousands of lives sliding into poverty due to job cuts and hunger.\nThe report says that about 10 billion people will be living in extreme poverty by 2025 if the coronavirus continues spreading as it has so far. In all, the pandemic has already forced about 100 million people back into poverty globally, raising fears that the global recession could result in the longest sustained decline in income and economic growth in three generations of governments.\nThere are about 10 billion people living in poverty globally, and it is projected to increase to 12 billion by 2025, according to a report released Monday by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).The report predicts that between 2015-2020, extreme poverty rates increased from 10.2 percent to 19.3 percent globally.\nThere was speculation that former president Donald Trump could be in the country, but was not in the US for the inauguration, his office said. But a second official said the US intelligence agency would not investigate whether Mr. Trump could have been involved in the attack. \"Neither intelligence nor law enforcement intelligence is interested in investigating whether any foreign entity could or did provide any aid to anybody on the attack today or whether foreign entities were planning the attack,\" a second official said.The official spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity in line with government policy.\nPresident Joe Biden delivered a message to the nation on Wednesday, telling Americans to unite and face the challenges ahead, and called on Americans to be thankful for the sacrifices made by those who've served in times of struggle and national disaster.\n\"This is not the time to wallow in self-pity, to retreat from society (or) isolate yourself from the challenges that confront us,\" the president said. \"America is stronger when we do -- far sicker when we do.\"\nWhile the country has seen its share of tragedies over the past month, including the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and Laura Palmer, the presidential remarks seemed to aim to reengage the country. President Biden urged Americans to remember all the lives lost in the coronavirus pandemic, calling the country \"shallow,\" while urging the country to unite to keep up the fight.","token_len":597,"entropy":[10.3068,1.3255,7.442,1.5529,4.7641,6.1612,0.8433,2.468,0.2696,6.0886,2.6898,0.7719,5.1898,2.8189,6.8955,9.7343,1.4736,0.329,5.3513,1.2702,7.0423,0.4174,2.644,1.5861,3.4182,0.0015,4.4708,1.2244,1.2852,0.1823,8.4992,0.0035,11.2711,11.6712,1.137,5.7238,1.721,2.6619,1.8837,3.8503,1.5606,3.7219,1.5407,4.4326,0.1052,3.232,3.0098,1.5017,0.1662,3.5153,1.8783,2.2468,0.001,6.7858,4.0378,2.2768,8.0729,0.7313,2.1061,2.5453,2.9423,2.1523,6.4518,6.8603,3.085,7.0398,3.5676,0.7887,1.9217,1.8564,2.4204,4.6796,1.846,1.7988,0.0005,2.6737,0.0289,0.1273,0.1954,0.3612,4.8257,2.4167,0.9094,0.7507,1.1388,4.8976,0.0312,4.6231,6.5934,5.4458,0.6355,0.1487,6.8144,0.4214,0.2593,0.0007,0.0001,0.0,0.0023,5.8504,0.4574,1.5787,1.6563,0.4718,1.7315,6.3305,0.9702,0.0178,6.0525,1.438,1.8996,2.0938,4.3268,5.0409,2.1135,3.929,4.561,2.7438,0.3242,0.9538,1.7505,0.338,0.1668,1.769,2.3861,0.0757,0.2829,1.8101,10.8382,5.5179,0.0399,6.2255,1.7317,4.3389,5.5963,0.5771,8.2099,0.9767,2.1653,3.4966,3.3819,0.8395,8.6904,3.3964,2.0226,14.385,6.6692,1.5916,3.0016,0.0194,7.2272,8.0318,7.3135,2.4573,6.5708,0.3077,4.8572,11.2855,0.9954,2.1786,6.0826,0.0214,8.927,4.9782,1.1799,6.0838,0.4878,1.8969,2.1886,2.5052,3.051,0.9152,4.5669,3.7817,4.1361,0.255,2.5563,1.5369,2.6311,0.5657,2.0456,0.0312,0.7838,2.9852,4.0792,1.1275,5.8586,0.0005,0.0126,2.3272,5.2083,4.6628,0.7831,1.2011,3.3748,0.0805,1.007,3.5152,6.1466,0.2653,1.8929,4.6459,0.0025,1.4763,5.0176,5.4389,3.0927,4.1551,0.4865,0.2125,6.9101,1.1567,1.0434,4.7965,1.2125,5.6464,3.96,0.8059,1.4005,3.446,5.545,1.4064,4.5479,0.1035,2.3559,8.363,4.7827,3.4498,0.2625,4.9092,2.8955,3.1708,0.6491,0.6846,5.0053,3.355,5.4703,4.7474,0.8478,0.9598,5.0592,1.1829,3.4146,3.2682,1.6501,0.2462,1.0075,0.2652,3.365,1.5198,0.8415,1.9728,4.236,0.9327,1.8641,1.6117,2.8212,0.6349,3.3661,0.1949,0.0932,1.8148,1.2344,0.6011,0.0032,2.4959,1.3955,1.1571,4.6698,0.2237,0.4003,2.7148,0.0125,1.4103,0.4009,1.9898,0.0042,0.0017,0.2884,7.9768,0.8598,4.468,0.3161,4.5683,3.8297,3.4767,1.9661,0.2744,6.8859,0.06,2.1875,6.9484,3.2843,3.4432,1.3184,2.3041,0.6669,0.7704,3.1154,0.299,2.2074,0.0084,2.5637,0.9954,1.7892,4.8536,3.6261,5.9945,0.8066,7.0803,3.4887,5.8203,0.0494,2.2206,2.5918,3.1661,1.4678,4.1962,3.1446,1.2781,5.3873,2.719,3.3398,1.4007,5.2167,2.9096,0.6807,2.5307,2.2265,6.3109,3.6021,0.6378,0.8137,4.8344,3.528,5.9871,3.3888,2.2239,1.9356,1.2598,6.6929,3.2652,4.5383,0.9255,4.7946,2.4163,4.0371,1.797,0.0071,3.6895,2.8092,1.1129,3.4904,0.5686,0.5665,3.7744,0.6021,2.9964,6.6842,6.7974,1.3506,2.2872,0.0131,7.3904,2.0733,8.4833,0.1022,3.3266,2.3887,3.3303,2.8919,3.8896,3.6225,5.9878,2.4217,4.8961,2.8014,4.2345,0.869,7.4022,3.9461,0.9342,5.0201,6.7938,3.2353,4.2729,4.6853,1.7192,2.13,6.434,3.2328,0.2857,0.7102,2.4982,4.1579,0.3193,0.3722,0.2089,6.1893,4.2236,3.2595,3.4737,0.7542,0.6906,0.1195,0.0141,0.0007,3.869,5.1752,0.0129,4.0256,0.8846,0.393,0.9495,3.8379,9.6326,0.2957,6.0139,0.8656,3.6893,0.7642,1.1437,2.9196,1.3594,2.6738,1.5099,2.7815,3.8367,1.038,6.0014,2.3965,5.4115,1.2092,2.7727,2.3549,2.5092,2.9009,4.9244,0.9897,3.6109,0.2093,3.8108,6.9191,0.4911,0.6463,4.1827,2.1718,0.5121,1.8802,0.7093,4.5652,2.6846,1.8243,6.8695,0.0495,5.7829,2.2172,6.1893,4.5188,0.1813,1.093,0.5791,3.4098,0.9306,1.1021,2.4816,1.2582,0.5529,8.6264,0.0551,0.0796,3.9567,0.0679,1.6108,0.0012,1.6733,2.3672,5.5487,1.1462,7.2332,7.6169,2.1642,1.1366,7.7624,2.6218,0.8039,1.2159,5.1359,1.5177,4.1437,0.9897,1.1406,2.3788,1.3254,0.1024,0.4515,0.6933,4.3284,1.346,2.0015,1.4262,0.3895,4.1984,8.6459,7.2552,13.2777,0.0424,0.1306,0.1114,1.1997,2.4845,0.7031,5.2894,1.4498,5.2399,1.894,2.4596,2.6401,1.4334,0.0017,4.5099,2.317,0.0423,0.521,5.6035,0.2285,4.1409,0.8151,3.1671,0.0333,9.0624,14.4625,1.4871,12.3479,6.1545,6.6135,6.5001,9.0714,0.6202,9.4321,10.7677,6.6862,0.8554,6.2141,4.2434,0.1869,1.3595,5.3933,5.8028,5.5764,0.6082,7.7733,0.8072,5.7322,4.6859,0.0037,1.2042,1.875,2.9591,4.2779,5.4238,4.4363,1.2688,0.2017,2.6742,5.2385,1.5171,3.7823,0.5469,1.6895,0.6702,9.2208,0.0057,0.0039,3.2564,0.0142,1.0531,3.5363,2.39,4.0894,1.2602,5.77,5.3694,4.4086,4.3354,3.0325,2.2596,2.9994,0.2799,4.7994,3.1826,4.7511,3.7721,1.4315,0.3536,1.3087]}

The US dropped its hydrogen bomb \"Little Boy\" and nuclear-powered cruise missile \"Nimitz\" in the Japanese town of Nagasaki in Japan on August 9, 1945, the day the US finished surrender in World War II, while the British used the nuclear bomb \"Home Run.\"\nThe nuclear bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, set off America's entry into World War II which ended in August 1945. The bomb, called \"Little Boy\", exploded at nine seconds of a minute, killing at least 70,000 people and destroying 20,000 buildings in Hiroshima and surrounding areas, in Japan's worst and deadliest nuclear attack.\nPosted 22 Sep 2021 22 Sep 2021 Thu 22 Sep 2021 at 11:28pm, updated 23 Sep 2021 23 Sep 2021 Fri 23 Sep 2021 at 12:31am","token_len":597,"entropy":[8.1501,0.0315,5.1358,3.0505,7.1078,5.3183,0.9322,7.2611,1.2583,0.434,0.0302,7.3906,1.0052,2.324,0.1428,4.0438,1.6917,0.4207,0.9408,5.6309,1.9448,0.0367,8.5042,0.4288,0.0052,2.5305,7.8397,0.0003,6.1705,2.463,7.5688,0.6548,3.7832,6.216,8.4098,0.8772,7.4237,4.801,0.5162,1.2864,10.8458,0.2859,3.813,1.4356,0.2376,0.1496,14.3322,2.9924,0.723,0.0877,2.9623,2.7111,7.1515,0.6323,6.6791,0.0008,0.0541,0.6994,1.1575,5.5308,3.5975,3.1227,0.0277,3.6076,8.2694,1.2752,0.2908,0.3686,1.4288,1.561,2.343,6.4861,1.2376,2.7034,5.8488,0.0575,2.6598,1.0804,3.7948,3.3999,0.0208,2.4999,1.2403,0.9827,5.9298,1.5813,6.9309,1.7051,0.8704,0.7781,6.7115,0.0434,0.2929,4.7843,0.7056,2.2955,7.7318,1.1401,0.4398,2.5614,4.1606,0.6644,0.3058,15.8174,0.5507,0.1104,1.4897,1.368,9.3773,0.5864,0.3499,8.3186,7.1095,0.4414,4.1599,5.5505,0.2306,0.1945,4.2054,0.0013,0.0143,0.8708,0.7271,5.8615,0.7142,3.684,0.2307,1.2679,1.3267,5.7398,6.6532,0.068,7.3892,4.5451,0.6462,4.5121,0.3688,4.8747,2.3021,2.4445,4.9191,3.3485,6.1962,0.0031,0.5531,4.7242,0.2577,0.0047,1.7337,2.3076,4.5788,0.2749,0.4192,1.2527,5.063,2.0366,0.9892,0.2034,0.0982,2.259,2.5665,0.0217,3.5457,3.436,0.9726,0.0195,1.0799,0.6625,0.6512,0.1867,2.104,0.0882,3.9469,0.2548,1.1303,2.4696,1.1765,5.39,0.9497,2.3689,5.1413,3.8937,2.816,0.0277,0.8881,0.5491,1.0063,0.4831,4.9523,6.4468,1.5116,2.5933,3.9985,2.8472,2.8165,0.2188,0.0012,2.8072,3.1421,1.5337,0.0293,0.2066,2.6533,6.4004,0.0614,1.5316,2.9657,0.8312,3.269,4.1515,3.4443,1.2896,3.712,3.2854,1.51,1.5487,4.2019,1.1606,0.0746,2.4555,3.7037,1.3466,2.4159,3.999,0.4271,5.5161,2.4088,1.5494,4.3801,4.9926,0.1495,0.4451,1.2977,2.3487,1.5599,0.3905,0.2881,2.9184,3.6731,3.8652,3.4979,0.0005,0.0108,2.466,4.6416,0.0004,1.6934,0.8073,3.1377,1.9812,10.5167,6.4125,0.6715,3.7106,2.9705,5.8123,3.1807,3.276,1.2639,4.5162,4.5563,1.889,0.3827,0.8956,0.2001,0.3499,5.9573,0.0043,0.9736,4.311,0.5631,5.2373,0.0366,0.3625,5.7612,9.4462,0.1321,2.292,0.8054,4.3355,4.4304,7.84,0.0284,4.2772,1.9169,1.7021,1.1554,4.4677,6.5618,2.5172,0.3159,0.4697,3.9429,0.9514,2.8307,1.4646,0.757,0.4282,1.3412,2.1947,5.2357,1.4238,2.0922,1.0529,0.2891,5.4224,1.0119,5.3576,0.0352,0.9597,3.4174,1.9946,4.8131,1.9593,5.1087,6.4468,0.7555,1.6832,1.2129,3.7228,4.6719,1.1995,1.2296,0.4932,5.9197,2.3952,0.5911,4.0842,0.1248,0.1767,0.0055,3.5724,0.2302,1.5248,6.573,0.0275,4.1102,0.028,0.0005,0.9754,2.837,4.2345,2.5793,0.856,4.4199,0.3746,3.47,2.2064,3.6428,1.6854,4.9119,3.3494,2.9589,0.3287,1.5514,4.1728,0.5368,5.5564,4.7704,2.0898,0.6995,1.5004,2.2802,9.3091,2.6278,9.3051,0.3536,1.0123,2.085,4.5669,0.5031,4.2975,0.525,3.1837,1.5294,8.5269,3.2752,0.0877,3.6163,2.5545,3.5738,0.7222,7.8751,0.3381,1.292,1.9181,0.4026,4.5788,1.2774,1.5744,5.2901,5.3978,5.1384,1.1638,3.6628,1.5024,0.0555,1.6764,1.5167,1.4995,2.0644,2.2955,4.3088,8.2552,0.5356,3.2222,4.7368,6.5176,0.0184,0.4546,2.068,0.8287,3.4221,4.0563,9.9661,0.2177,0.7806,2.904,3.0265,0.5833,1.7797,3.2525,0.1171,9.3936,2.272,1.6377,6.5185,3.0912,1.5401,6.3949,6.5655,4.0569,3.1507,2.0183,1.9597,4.5513,3.5899,5.9269,0.2186,7.1268,6.5455,0.1334,0.4055,2.7127,5.7139,2.4627,1.9727,4.2795,3.1467,2.7731,3.9499,6.0751,2.3192,0.8751,1.3393,2.1981,7.6526,4.8833,0.0405,0.9736,0.1107,1.7907,4.9457,2.706,2.7368,2.8378,0.5501,0.9852,1.8451,3.3537,2.003,1.7755,2.0008,8.2848,8.3515,6.8053,2.5141,0.0007,0.1468,3.1415,4.2865,1.066,2.814,4.0056,1.9423,3.0745,1.1644,1.834,7.5063,2.7712,2.533,0.8215,1.3642,3.7748,5.1022,1.2614,0.813,4.2238,1.2508,2.8767,0.3302,0.0311,0.8773,5.4159,0.2502,9.1951,0.0464,6.9677,0.0718,0.9611,0.0019,0.0639,6.0148,2.2251,1.4225,5.0644,0.5831,0.6425,2.0727,4.5236,3.065,3.9815,2.6068,1.434,0.0349,1.9903,2.8206,2.6325,7.097,4.2949,3.0791,2.2149,4.964,1.5376,0.8707,3.6431,0.0007,4.5408,0.104,0.0813,0.2638,1.2793,3.0576,5.7732,0.4503,0.0352,0.7269,2.063,1.3196,1.3727,5.3211,0.661,2.515,4.748,3.9629,2.2348,5.6922,5.1333,0.9143,2.5282,2.431,1.8584,0.7122,8.8367,10.2213,6.6064,8.314,8.6634,6.0498,0.6183,11.0378,3.6262,0.5015,0.8385,4.4581,2.3106,0.0605,4.2537,5.3111,6.4018,4.9382,1.8092,0.1225,0.4171,1.7802,0.0016,0.0291,5.1126,1.2514,0.0008,0.0363,1.003,2.081,0.0011,4.2067,1.5273]}
{"prompt":"A small group of Palestinian protesters on Sunday set fire to placards printed with images of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Middle East negotiator Jason Greenblatt outside Jesus s traditional birthplace , days before","text":"A small group of Palestinian protesters on Sunday set fire to placards printed with images of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Middle East negotiator Jason Greenblatt outside Jesus s traditional birthplace, days before a U.S.-brokered talks in Annapolis aimed at ending Israel s occupation of the Holy Land.\nProtesters showed two placards to denounce the Trump administration s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and support it military buildup in the West Bank. One placard read: Jerusalem is in the future of the people of Palestine. The other said: Mike Pence is with the Israeli army. The placards were part of a larger protest group that took place a block down from the Temple Mount, a holy site for Jews, Christians and Muslims that lies in the middle of Jerusalem. Jesus passed through town about two centuries ago, reaching the city by sea from Galilee. But Palestinians have long sought to claim the city as their birthplace, a contention that is rejected by Israel, the U.S., and numerous other countries. Pence, a Jewish evangelical, is visiting Israel and the rest of the Middle East. Friday s meeting was one of the few major meetings that Palestinians have had with U.S. diplomats, and Trump s U.S. envoy to Israel, Jared Kushner, was part of the delegation. However, Palestinian factions that are not part of the movement for Hamas in Ramallah refused to accept the invitation. Hamas supporters said they have no room for the U.S. in any Palestinian unity government. They also described Pence as a supporter of Israel with a pro-occupation agenda. A Palestinian source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the protest in the area was not connected with the U.S. Pence did not meet Netanyahu during his trip Thursday and Friday. Netanyahu called the Pence visit \"a political act\", Palestinian source said, after the Israeli leader was not invited to travel to Israel. Jerusalem, which is under the control of Israel on the West Bank and East Jerusalem, was the cultural, spiritual and political heart of the Jewish people, but it has been ruled by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. The Temple Mount is the location of Judaism s holiest sites and the location where Jesus performed a series of miracles around the time he was born. Jewish leaders have argued for many decades that the place deserves the title of capital of Israel, and Jerusalem became a center of political unrest in the first Intifada, a Palestinian uprising that started in September 1987. (AP) The White House said Pence met with Trump at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beaches late Friday and then he left for Jerusalem and the West Bank. He had no meetings with Palestinian leaders. \"Pence did all he would as a vice president and was very respectful,\" a White House spokesperson said Saturday. A Palestinian source said Abbas would not see Pence until his return to Ramallah, where he is expected to meet with Hamas representatives.

Smell. And a perfectly baked bread smothered in a warm and satisfying spread. That\u2019s what the BEST Baked French Toast is all about!\nIt\u2019s also easy to prepare. When you\u2019re in a hurry, this is the recipe to use. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, dust a rack with some non-stick spray, and line the bottom of a 13\u00d79 pan with parchment. You\u2019ll want to line a loaf pan though, for mealtime ease.\nSet out a few items that you\u2019ll need to serve your bread on. I like to leave this step up to the last minute, so it doesn\u2019t turn into a full-blown bake sale. A plate, a glass of milk, sugar and cinnamon are all that you\u2019ll need, but you can also add chopped almonds, walnuts, dried cherries, dried cranberries, or even candied nuts.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Dust a 13\u00d79 pan with non-stick cooking spray, and preheat a grill; if you don\u2019t use a spray, coat both sides with a few teaspoons of margarine and rub in with a paper towel. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the bread flour, sugar and cinnamon and blend for 3-5 seconds to combine. Add the butter to the mixture and mix on low speed until the butter turns into fine crumbs. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing just until combined. Add the milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, continuing to blend. Finally, add the 2 teaspoons of freshly ground sea salt, and blend until everything is just smooth.\nIf you\u2019ve assembled your items, spread a thin layer of melted butter on the bottom of the pan, and preheat the grill for the top. If the pan is a loaf pan, line the bottom of the pan, and fill just shy of the sides with beans, herbs, meats, or whatever else you may have in mind. If using a standard dish, line the bottom and cut the sides, and fill them with what you may have planned on using. Pour over your prepared batter, spooning it all the way to the top of the fillings.","token_len":597,"entropy":[6.3041,2.2758,2.2011,7.328,0.0087,0.1219,0.1123,2.1363,0.4521,0.0051,6.2154,5.0901,8.0091,6.1425,3.6055,4.3587,0.7731,6.344,2.7999,0.552,0.3965,2.312,1.4192,3.7744,2.9548,0.7572,3.2577,2.1196,5.7388,11.0498,10.9117,1.7019,7.1347,1.4064,2.3613,1.0059,6.7648,1.8007,1.5917,1.2736,1.3222,0.3578,2.8852,5.3085,5.4831,1.824,4.9466,3.1199,4.0214,1.7653,1.3847,3.1355,9.5415,2.5011,0.0004,0.4008,6.1388,1.9967,18.9597,9.0731,5.391,9.4344,10.3054,1.94,1.5547,4.7981,9.4574,5.0107,0.0148,12.1304,5.5792,14.2848,9.6066,5.9504,9.2793,3.0899,0.1783,5.7099,6.1099,3.1722,0.7564,10.2574,5.5058,9.6035,0.7998,3.6956,7.7377,10.0103,3.9678,6.9697,3.0899,1.244,5.8609,3.7955,10.5728,0.1519,5.1936,1.3844,5.8008,8.91,0.2072,8.2174,10.9087,3.793,0.8912,3.7818,9.2448,3.9232,12.3191,5.1995,7.2143,5.7409,1.3126,7.3861,2.9889,0.153,1.8534,5.2542,5.9227,3.0259,2.0526,2.9187,0.6165,3.1503,9.4914,6.7847,4.512,6.686,0.881,0.1947,3.8018,3.923,8.8982,6.6103,4.2664,8.0227,1.33,0.0015,0.2673,1.9579,5.4376,3.146,5.4968,8.5367,1.7638,5.4415,17.0444,7.5069,3.6142,1.6804,2.9634,6.8233,4.2891,1.5926,6.6472,1.1924,1.2544,0.591,0.0012,1.8053,1.493,5.0761,5.8372,0.2296,0.0519,4.9996,6.3045,0.374,3.0419,1.7781,5.5552,1.1821,4.8436,1.1623,1.4956,3.0034,2.9532,2.7326,0.5627,3.5558,1.8056,1.1274,4.0637,2.1971,5.0203,1.2889,6.827,0.0994,1.3448,0.0188,0.0574,0.998,1.2042,4.0175,8.5386,2.7096,4.5883,0.1606,4.7675,4.5636,0.7991,0.097,1.2374,0.7917,0.5057,3.7088,1.4852,2.1526,0.5346,1.4181,5.0425,3.1073,2.2036,2.8884,0.1265,1.2665,4.5788,4.8722,1.3408,0.285,0.9796,1.7238,0.3698,5.0171,2.9878,5.5147,0.1913,9.4299,1.4402,5.3461,12.0637,1.5143,7.7494,0.4403,2.5537,6.016,4.0798,1.8758,4.36,6.4732,3.1415,0.7411,1.9849,0.3037,0.3146,2.8408,0.7623,6.4498,2.8565,3.2884,3.5237,1.5877,2.9807,3.7482,0.4543,4.2248,4.8041,5.5734,2.2176,0.9636,1.8662,5.6807,2.5139,1.2608,1.869,3.4297,3.9624,0.1974,0.1999,0.6106,5.3549,1.278,0.5108,2.8222,2.0618,1.2545,5.6403,6.9726,0.5277,4.7355,5.7949,3.3598,1.835,4.5598,1.7672,2.1662,0.4682,6.8195,2.1799,3.8381,2.8527,0.8136,2.5893,1.5788,1.6067,0.0383,0.0197,0.2718,2.6956,1.53,2.1191,2.44,2.6247,2.0246,5.4714,3.6999,1.245,2.9865,0.0152,0.7123,4.1533,1.8259,0.0016,0.6077,3.2461,3.2708,0.005,0.5713,3.0846,2.2534,5.9134,0.0764,3.2372,1.0015,1.4162,4.6243,0.0352,0.3873,0.0352,0.0243,0.5966,0.1629,0.9459,3.9453,0.3418,7.4216,0.0884,0.0185,0.0428,0.02,2.2771,0.0008,0.0018,12.7639,0.0003,1.0108,0.8472,6.433,0.1693,3.208,5.6464,8.7479,4.6314,0.8002,2.0582,0.2667,0.0637,0.0026,3.6198,0.7285,6.5032,2.6914,6.4662,5.1988,0.2765,1.4423,2.224,3.7866,4.3651,0.2003,6.9755,0.0042,1.6366,5.6276,2.5751,2.891,0.9701,5.7018,0.079,0.6696,4.5346,1.2357,5.7779,0.0782,0.1187,0.1244,0.0035,0.5497,0.0159,0.9686,0.0631,0.0004,0.1511,2.4983,0.3154,6.0865,1.9875,0.3858,1.7986,0.9243,0.1451,2.0644,4.3618,3.7087,2.8696,1.5553,0.5873,2.7708,3.5427,0.8822,0.3715,1.9569,0.3561,2.7985,3.0341,0.1034,4.307,0.7669,1.3289,1.9999,0.9054,0.2722,0.7259,1.6151,1.8129,4.9689,3.6863,6.4812,0.9368,0.0399,0.5422,1.8306,0.2893,2.9195,1.109,3.8558,0.0775,0.0019,0.0002,0.3151,2.5422,4.5215,0.1984,2.0268,0.2782,1.6298,0.2454,2.6437,1.1329,4.5824,1.6712,0.0873,0.0049,0.003,0.3813,6.3483,0.6498,3.7256,2.5415,4.5827,0.1641,0.7244,0.1434,6.9746,1.2486,0.5552,6.8023,0.6646,7.5505,0.0029,1.2338,2.038,3.4782,1.274,4.5698,0.3303,4.4392,3.72,0.5067,1.6268,4.0286,0.4163,2.1744,0.0479,0.6556,9.6677,1.1135,8.1616,1.4376,6.5907,2.5252,3.0117,0.1584,0.1142,3.9833,0.3886,1.3239,1.425,1.9582,0.2772,1.0639,1.2197,1.5625,1.483,6.4799,0.1975,0.5312,4.0421,3.804,2.8203,5.7047,2.716,3.5482,2.1696,3.1192,0.5617,3.9524,5.853,0.2645,0.1608,5.4815,1.2504,0.6807,1.2804,0.2081,0.2751,4.676,0.8563,4.5114,7.5305,6.2382,0.0126,0.595,5.5343,1.0708,10.5634,1.3944,7.1605,0.6458,8.2554,0.4355,1.8932,3.9644,1.413,0.3434,3.6953,1.0925,1.8322,4.3364,0.317,2.8798,4.1339,0.4408,5.7593,5.2109,1.0561,3.879,0.5517,0.8063,3.6591,7.53,1.5125,1.724,3.7892,1.6603,3.4443,3.8654,1.3754,5.96,0.5103,3.4484,1.1423,6.2675,2.7632,1.8325,0.501,4.2077,3.3939,3.2883,2.3874,6.1344,1.1747,6.4824,1.6445,1.8126,3.2302,4.436,0.0109,2.5676,0.0944,0.9319,1.7358,0.1221,11.5907,1.8577,0.7638]}

Emphasising that","text":"Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Pope Francis agreed in a phone call on Thursday that any attempts to change Jerusalem s status should be avoided, sources in Erdogan s office said. Emphasising that both sides were committed to the rule of law, the sources said the two were agreed to stand strong against attempts to split Israel s capital. The same sources said Pope Francis offered the help of the Vatican Mission in Israel to Turkey in settling the current dispute.\nTurkey s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Rome on Thursday on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the foreign ministers of the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. Erdogan has made an official state visit to Italy before as guest of honour and hosted a Turkish President at his reception at the Vatican Palace a week ago. According to the foreign ministry, the visits will be followed by talks between foreign ministers of both countries in the presence of the foreign ministers of the Islamic Cooperation Organisation. A foreign ministry official said both foreign ministers plans to hold bilateral talks later this week. The Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni invited Italian and Turkish delegations for discussion and negotiation on the Syrian conflicts at Italy s ministerial in Rome on April 21.\nThe European Union will discuss Turkey s request to implement its visa-free travel and economic partnership agreements on May 29, the European Union Commission said on Wednesday. No details have been announced of why the date has been chosen so late. The commission said it would discuss a final assessment of Turkey s compliance with EU standards on May 29, in advance of giving conditional approval to Turkish visa-free travel arrangements with EU countries on July 1. EU officials have previously said they are prepared to grant full visa-free travel to Turkey on July 1 as long as some formalities are in place. A decision would not come until a European Parliament plenary session on June 17. Turkey is the only EU member that does not have a free movement agreement with the European Union, but its government has pledged that it will be in place by July 1. EU-Turkey visa-free travel will open to 27 EU nations, including France. Withdrawing visas that are now required to enter Turkey is part of a deal that came to an end in November.\nThe Turkish prime minister said that he believes that President Donald Trump s order to cut U.S. military funding to Turkey will trigger an airstrike by the United States in Syria on Turkey s shores as part of a retaliatory move.

ON ESTIMATES THAT THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN COULD INCREASE FEDERAL DEFICIT BY $ 1.5 TRILLION \u201c The deficit is growing in our country at a much faster rate than any time since the end of World War II.\u201d REPUBLICANS DO NOT WANT TO CONVERT THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN INTO POLITICAL BUSINESS \u201cWe are trying to deal with the business of America. We are not trying to come on and start talking about the politics of it.\u201d ON THE FUTURE OF A CONTINUATION OF STEROID THERAPY FOR TERRIBLE CANCER \u201cWe are working to do the right thing but in the end, that all the facts of the matter.\u201d ON BREAKING THE CANCER CHALLENGE IN AMERICA \u201cWe have to find the right balance of where we care about individual patients\u2019 rights and where we make the case that we need to be doing more.\u201d ON WHAT GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO SUPERVISE DEVELOPMENT OF ONCHOCERCAVARIAN, TUBERCULOUS, AND MALIGANTCARCINOMA \u201cWe have developed a treatment plan and we are working on the research to improve diagnosis and treatment. The biggest thing for me is that we have to identify those who are at greatest risk and then make sure there is access to treatment. I am confident that we will see some very important results in the future, especially in regards to developing new drugs.\u201d ON CANCER AS A HONORARY PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY CONTINUING WITH HER STUDY OF LIPID DIABETES \u201cIf we do something to lower blood triglycerid-.e, cholesterol, and blood sugar, that could have a major impact on the risk of not only heart disease, but on cancer as well.\u201d ON THE PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE BUSINESS \u201cWe have a tremendous opportunity to change the entire business.

In total, the legislation would require approximately 20,000 job losses over a five-year period.\nOther provisions in the legislation would require small businesses, especially those owned by minorities, to pay no sales tax; require a new law exempting small businesses from the income tax until the end of the decade; and provide tax breaks for those who hire people of color on a contract basis.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we saw a budget that was more like a business plan and not like a spending plan, and that\u2019s why we were not willing to help pass this, \u201d Democratic lawmaker Jason Chaffetz said on Thursday.\nHe added that the veto message would include detailed information on the implications of the bill.\nAs with previous veto messages from Malloy, the new one didn\u2019t call on Democratic lawmakers to reconsider the legislation. Instead, it said that the Governor was \u201centitled to determine that there is a better alternative. \u201d\n\u201cWe believe we have a better alternative, \u201d said State Senate President Robert DeLeo (D-New Haven) in a statement to MSNBC.\nChaffetz added that the state\u2019s Republican-controlled General Assembly is unlikely to consider alternative legislation. It comes as DeLeo is expected to return to the state House after filing a new state constitution, which includes provisions for the sale of marijuana for medicinal use. The governor has not yet indicated when it will be legal to buy marijuana for medicinal purposes in Connecticut.","token_len":598,"entropy":[10.4621,5.2004,1.3355,0.0299,0.0829,0.0012,2.8305,2.0257,5.5409,2.1194,4.461,14.3842,2.7856,2.4708,0.3457,8.3912,0.7981,1.9023,4.6171,0.3704,3.984,3.35,0.1097,1.0838,1.7719,1.2523,1.4495,2.811,1.6731,4.6174,1.1613,1.0902,17.3864,8.035,9.0335,5.0824,3.974,2.8185,6.8834,4.6733,0.7875,2.6657,2.8675,7.6415,1.7673,0.166,1.0188,0.0007,4.7113,0.7972,4.5606,0.2613,0.5303,15.2203,5.3275,8.7592,6.186,4.8102,3.388,3.9951,0.0647,5.9003,1.5486,6.903,2.4661,4.0143,4.4226,2.7751,5.7435,2.8431,4.2953,2.0538,4.4994,1.0631,1.7296,4.1663,3.2781,0.4884,1.6208,4.5275,8.1956,5.1426,7.0194,6.0942,1.3237,0.057,0.9489,4.7667,2.1766,2.9173,0.3102,0.019,0.0727,5.0915,3.4583,6.424,3.0561,3.1648,6.7995,3.6877,1.6239,2.3713,6.6636,0.8757,2.9885,1.4661,6.5953,2.27,10.9201,0.0322,2.6525,0.8392,4.2655,0.7197,5.1825,2.2977,0.9883,2.9747,0.2004,1.369,1.3663,0.293,3.8279,2.5976,9.3675,6.7687,7.3331,0.5653,0.3718,0.7968,1.0926,0.5579,1.6406,3.9253,2.0838,1.5292,0.1502,2.9752,2.9087,7.5243,1.3423,7.0745,3.9582,4.2722,1.676,2.058,3.9963,4.4848,0.551,1.0697,3.4257,2.2943,4.5364,1.2167,1.4553,2.0244,1.7101,0.3236,1.4155,3.162,1.1677,11.2894,0.0007,0.4016,3.2131,0.8349,0.4657,4.5061,6.0552,2.8068,0.3019,0.2798,2.4591,0.5519,4.2732,1.5735,1.077,4.2609,2.7441,0.9467,6.4365,7.4769,4.1048,2.7569,0.3782,6.1199,1.553,1.5785,3.0901,2.9893,3.786,6.6621,2.9448,0.3283,6.1098,0.8287,1.7429,3.1157,1.4395,2.9441,5.4092,2.6048,0.9533,3.6219,0.7743,7.8287,0.3136,2.7359,3.7819,0.6486,0.0155,4.0023,2.3608,0.0619,0.0744,0.2264,4.8325,3.1413,0.8729,0.5162,5.9298,6.1754,0.0905,1.349,1.4123,5.1228,1.0451,0.1449,2.5417,2.217,3.505,5.0553,3.8493,3.7739,5.3309,2.04,3.3103,0.2516,0.8379,0.6825,2.4316,4.5525,4.5434,4.3031,3.4926,2.2749,6.1853,1.475,4.1537,7.0388,4.8801,0.5915,2.0231,2.3336,0.667,0.2128,0.7227,1.434,0.9075,2.8434,0.6663,0.0195,3.968,3.6114,1.0693,2.7264,1.0689,5.4926,3.6144,0.005,0.824,5.8011,3.97,3.8987,5.9559,0.729,4.6904,2.3269,4.3877,0.4169,3.8566,0.4676,3.3194,0.4081,3.4734,3.7769,0.3819,0.4256,6.6092,0.438,0.5521,0.6243,0.0018,0.3151,4.9492,3.9805,0.0493,0.8253,3.9611,0.3493,3.6111,2.7643,4.1156,0.0194,0.026,4.488,1.8334,1.7478,0.7875,0.1214,0.0356,0.0005,0.0138,0.8031,0.3159,6.4978,1.3352,2.393,0.0643,2.145,1.6666,2.6928,3.7554,0.2738,4.0346,4.9224,1.3595,4.1731,0.5249,5.9077,0.3909,0.0922,2.6211,5.2765,5.9494,0.4678,5.7597,2.7274,3.4323,3.0299,4.4084,6.2205,0.0079,3.4113,0.334,0.3243,1.3661,4.203,0.287,7.0994,2.2527,1.9827,0.0029,0.9946,2.9114,0.2197,0.697,3.5277,4.3437,1.6726,0.3519,3.2255,1.1617,5.0085,3.3235,3.0015,0.1059,4.0966,2.2027,4.9669,0.0577,0.5391,0.3328,2.1544,0.3894,6.4858,0.1056,3.1157,4.9478,1.9163,6.3574,1.2516,1.9159,4.0374,3.7989,0.8726,5.4429,2.0998,3.3926,3.3137,2.4781,0.4069,6.7854,0.1829,1.7929,1.1819,1.9294,6.591,2.6031,0.7954,2.5067,0.7899,3.9071,3.3969,3.2642,0.0163,5.4016,5.6914,0.9429,5.8302,2.2485,0.3414,8.147,5.9448,6.0408,4.9602,0.0004,0.8132,1.8128,0.8582,0.3395,0.6512,4.8968,2.1823,0.3662,1.0627,7.4451,3.231,1.8643,3.6822,6.5138,2.3997,1.2273,0.8369,6.3375,0.1526,0.4178,0.9794,2.0235,0.2999,5.0584,4.9127,3.0667,3.6092,2.4234,2.9861,3.5673,0.0022,0.6415,0.8957,4.2524,3.876,5.4072,3.0517,3.0759,0.4743,5.9902,3.4991,6.2441,0.893,0.0849,5.199,1.1725,2.8719,0.8623,1.6672,0.064,0.9026,2.7076,0.8168,1.3062,4.9383,3.2501,9.4332,1.8235,7.4234,0.4283,1.3131,5.687,4.7108,4.6001,1.3975,1.3749,3.3045,4.5325,3.2972,3.4713,1.4264,0.4462,1.4746,0.1812,2.3948,3.2986,3.1792,1.5497,1.1461,1.7412,0.9989,1.4784,2.0029,0.2978,4.438,5.7897,3.3785,0.9083,5.4486,3.5326,0.6671,0.1102,4.4761,0.1989,0.3259,3.4431,1.1239,1.9623,1.2697,0.254,0.3114,1.6458,0.8826,0.8814,0.7843,6.7953,0.0113,0.0038,2.7573,0.1021,0.9835,3.9838,4.5769,0.4091,1.3781,6.0455,1.572,0.1482,4.2804,0.0007,2.6087,5.1864,0.0059,4.2494,8.0997,1.7319,2.489,5.2353,4.9153,1.6861,6.5592,0.0123,0.0023,1.9131,1.9315,0.0085,4.3663,0.2448,1.2019,1.8573,3.1658,3.8857,8.5268,1.0411,3.9463,4.7334,5.1818,3.4776,1.3093,4.6278,2.172,2.2716,2.4752,5.8137,0.2008,3.3236,3.3238,2.2073,1.8186,0.7133,3.312,1.8106,1.9227,2.7535,1.4841,2.9493,2.4014,5.4871,0.5114,3.1011,4.42,0.7014,3.1686,1.2328,2.0843,1.3304,1.0078,2.2727,0.8332,0.3466]}
{"prompt":"The U.S. House Intelligence Committee on Saturday said it had reached an agreement related to its subpoena of a Washington research firm \u2019 s bank records that would secure access to records for the panel","text":"The U.S. House Intelligence Committee on Saturday said it had reached an agreement related to its subpoena of a Washington research firm \u2019 s bank records that would secure access to records for the panel. The agreement was made in advance of a special congressional testimony in the Washington, D.C. court, said H...\nThe European Central Bank is to meet for the first time since President Mario Draghi was elected on 11 July, when it is expected to endorse the \u201cemergency measures\u201d of its policy of liquidity injection and the new plan presented in June by the former Italian finance minister for the eurozone crisis.\nThe European Central Bank is on Wednesday in the dock of the European Parliament. The European Parliament will hold its general debate at the beginning of July, and the committee\u2019s debate with Mario Draghi just before that. In the end of the month, the Commission, which is responsible for the Eurozone surveillance, will do the same.\nFollowing a very long debate with a large number of deputies, the European Parliament is about to vote on the \u201cEmergency legislation for the eurozone and the Stability Pact\u201d. It is a proposal for reform of the treaty and the Maastricht principles, which were introduced into the Treaties in 1999 and 2007, and the introduction of the \u201cnew Stability Pact\u201d that was agreed in June.\nThe European Parliament approved on Tuesday the \u201cemergency measures for crisis in the eurozone\u201d, but the votes were quite different from those that would have been expected. The European Parliament approved Tuesday the measures for a possible increase in the capital of the European Central Bank, in order to increase flexibility for the eurozone countries.\nIn a letter to the president of the European Central Bank, David Kerviel had demanded on Monday for the closure of the account, in consideration of the \u201csituation\u201d of his family. \u201cI have the most serious reasons to believe that I no longer have any rights attached to the open account on 31 May 2013 and on the date of my departure as the result of a decision of the European Central Bank\u201d, he wrote.\nOn Friday, the European Central Bank published the list of the bankers who had been involved in the manipulation of the Libor rates, the main international reference for the financing of the banks. As a result of the fraud committed by the bankers Axel Springer and Axel Capital Management, which were able to influence the \u201cworld\u201d market for loans and deposit rates, the European Central Bank announced on Tuesday a \u201cban of 5 to 15 years\u201d.\nThe European Parliament, in cooperation with European public opinion, has set the goal to bring the Euribor rate below negative 4% by July 2015. The European Commission has proposed several ways to achieve this objective, and among them the use of a tax on deposits, a system that is now under discussion in Spain and that could also be studied in France.","token_len":598,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2998,4.6205,0.0375,2.8043,3.7801,2.5841,1.274,1.858,4.4589,2.0645,0.1927,9.3456,0.0065,4.7379,6.968,0.8521,3.7014,5.5664,7.0804,0.5854,13.2151,8.4085,9.4777,7.9338,0.879,3.3369,3.9886,7.5328,3.3055,0.064,3.8227,4.5802,1.3945,6.9561,1.6249,2.0366,3.2433,1.8455,3.0471,2.0091,4.0247,0.2263,1.1263,4.6231,2.488,6.6083,2.6987,1.7681,6.6334,3.1091,0.0505,0.0007,0.0035,2.4412,4.5781,3.9372,4.1918,6.7097,10.0988,1.1111,10.6236,6.6528,3.8895,0.0014,2.6914,4.0432,4.6213,4.7085,1.791,0.2284,0.0064,2.339,4.2,8.18,0.0602,0.0005,2.9413,2.1476,2.9158,7.0701,2.2402,1.797,3.7026,1.2988,3.0366,0.7284,0.0481,6.5866,1.68,14.6332,5.6801,8.4683,0.7803,2.2275,1.8883,6.0194,3.263,2.9815,4.4097,2.4611,6.7002,4.9037,2.0297,3.8724,5.7505,6.2923,8.0876,2.8495,4.6433,1.6145,0.9825,6.8875,3.3515,1.6421,0.0186,6.8286,2.019,4.1202,4.3066,0.7522,1.42,1.3258,1.7521,0.1097,0.0028,1.0968,6.8998,4.7833,5.9307,3.2144,6.8135,1.0517,1.786,1.6318,2.5498,3.5098,1.5801,1.8838,2.2727,2.8823,2.2099,1.8582,5.292,5.2063,4.2577,2.1996,3.9991,0.0125,2.7321,1.9613,2.0592,1.3687,4.0823,10.1966,3.9143,0.4587,5.7653,6.1581,7.5563,0.008,0.0002,7.8132,1.5192,3.4516,0.9116,4.2451,1.7383,3.6787,5.0356,1.1737,3.9541,0.2777,0.7551,3.7672,3.8182,1.7014,1.6043,1.7757,0.0147,1.6302,4.1964,0.9831,11.6343,2.1339,0.6214,6.3618,1.8275,0.3437,0.5999,0.9486,6.2832,2.6658,6.1854,2.8453,3.6605,3.6327,3.9778,3.8943,1.0224,0.0033,6.8562,1.003,0.8018,1.5018,1.1249,2.5895,4.9056,0.0381,2.1957,0.4378,1.2194,7.7476,0.5615,6.0295,7.7587,5.0824,0.8386,3.6412,3.2176,1.1828,5.6245,3.3594,0.5358,1.8689,2.8538,2.8492,1.2684,2.9008,4.0363,2.9342,4.4746,0.9987,0.4206,6.981,2.2725,1.7491,9.966,0.994,0.0025,0.0004,8.8544,1.9172,1.0967,2.8988,3.6496,4.018,0.3404,5.7402,0.0004,1.0845,3.9162,2.0344,3.7338,1.7899,1.6344,2.7813,5.932,0.1371,0.9854,6.291,0.4136,5.1924,4.4684,0.2108,1.0787,0.2013,3.9259,1.9561,3.9077,1.1451,3.5371,1.4405,0.8881,0.9713,1.5076,0.8051,6.1021,5.4877,2.894,0.8918,5.6793,0.109,1.1271,0.0021,0.3757,2.589,7.3924,3.4719,0.5197,1.8359,2.2857,0.2365,1.7975,2.7317,1.7087,6.0727,1.9408,5.806,2.6355,0.7383,1.3069,2.7159,3.4935,0.7115,0.3969,3.1264,2.1164,1.2851,1.8296,0.4867,2.1807,8.5024,0.7885,3.9708,1.5239,3.0658,5.6334,5.2422,0.2369,0.6202,5.7134,4.6969,0.9004,1.9191,1.0965,0.0054,1.4915,4.0014,1.474,0.032,3.3232,7.73,1.8161,0.8764,3.4752,4.8075,1.5789,1.1666,2.9464,2.4669,3.0263,0.641,0.5033,5.1201,0.7881,0.0713,0.3039,1.5315,0.0051,0.6306,5.8881,3.7128,9.5868,0.8654,8.1917,5.4645,5.3485,2.6257,4.5469,0.9596,8.7304,0.0279,0.7355,6.3552,5.0069,3.8454,8.6009,0.4549,0.6097,5.1755,0.2184,6.9979,0.0509,2.7084,0.4268,1.2156,6.4536,5.8462,2.1881,6.4293,0.3782,5.2872,2.6474,4.0578,4.8309,3.5501,6.4225,1.1987,2.8773,0.1603,3.3275,7.083,0.0077,0.6559,2.5694,4.9059,7.7557,0.1568,1.4046,9.2481,1.798,4.8991,8.5018,2.4632,3.7864,3.0762,4.8835,1.4935,4.6454,0.695,1.4388,1.994,4.3898,2.9276,5.3773,0.0698,2.3831,3.3823,1.6577,0.2399,0.8736,1.1663,0.0325,1.9391,1.7085,2.9371,4.3736,1.5918,0.2658,0.5994,3.5512,3.3419,0.3331,0.9101,0.7955,1.6705,0.0117,4.6353,1.7932,4.086,0.0585,1.6325,8.3122,1.3243,1.4358,1.4073,2.6831,0.1873,0.6243,5.4111,0.2274,0.3855,7.1808,0.0063,3.9893,2.1005,3.2634,5.1043,5.9021,7.5762,2.3856,1.0209,7.0121,0.0871,1.174,6.2443,1.3997,4.8456,1.9242,0.3578,0.5454,0.7719,5.7236,4.4527,0.4837,0.8571,5.5919,15.5801,2.5483,0.7764,4.7644,11.0823,4.4257,0.6635,3.6565,3.0094,5.127,0.0163,4.3781,0.2259,6.258,0.0884,7.4059,1.8004,1.1579,3.8911,3.3157,4.2198,2.4298,5.41,4.2395,0.5614,0.6027,2.0678,0.0769,0.005,3.9471,1.5095,2.6207,3.9584,4.7775,0.0764,6.1354,2.5644,4.2981,5.0967,3.4233,3.226,4.1368,0.4979,1.6887,0.5867,1.2695,1.6817,2.5168,3.1633,2.3127,5.1383,0.0029,5.2062,7.1743,1.3722,0.4215,1.4869,5.4011,1.856,5.2044,2.3203,4.4353,1.6116,6.2181,1.1348,0.1693,1.581,5.2984,7.042,3.2122,2.8623,1.8322,4.275,2.3475,0.6399,1.4055,1.4687,1.8195,1.5092,3.0246,5.9566,5.3464,0.5785,2.651,0.4229,3.2912,1.192,2.6016,6.314,0.3833,2.0107,4.3448,0.012,2.0055,6.0817,1.4806,4.5992,2.5947,2.8132,4.6652,2.6541,2.3559,4.8238,3.2199,2.258,1.4649,4.5805,1.1994,5.8076,3.0646,3.3505,0.3945,6.6334,0.5114,2.7253,0.6662]}
{"prompt":"Russia is open to working with the United States to try to solve the crisis in Libya , Russia s ambassador to Libya was cited as saying on Friday by the RIA news agency .","text":"Russia is open to working with the United States to try to solve the crisis in Libya, Russia s ambassador to Libya was cited as saying on Friday by the RIA news agency. \"But we have no role to play, the crisis is internal, \" he said, when asked whether Russia is interested in working with the United States. \"We will help them solve the issue. \" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke this week with U.S. president Barack Obama after Lavrov had criticized the United States over its failure to block the European Union tying sanctions on Russia, calling him an \"ally of Israel\" for his support of the Israeli blockade of Gaza. The United States later said that it had only imposed the sanctions on Russia after being prompted by the European Union. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Friday that he \"would not under any circumstances accept Russian actions\" in Libya but that all options are open. \"We will take the decisions that are necessary,\" he said in Brussels, referring to his NATO allied powers. Libya's government has been weak for almost a year after a revolt that ousted Muammar Gaddafi, killed thousands of people and brought international condemnation of the longtime Libyan leader s brutal rule. UN peacekeepers, NATO troops and Arab rebel forces, backed by foreign military aid and weapons, have battled for control of the desert-controlled east of the country that has largely been isolated. NATO troops have suffered heavy casualties fighting Gaddafi forces. There have been hundreds of civilians reported killed during the civil war in Libya. Russia and its allies have also criticized moves by the Libya Interim National Military Council to form a government. The group met in Cairo on Friday to discuss holding a special consultative conference to discuss \"the constitutional framework of the political transition process\", the state-run Libyan Television announced. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Friday described the formation of a government of national unity as critical to achieving stability in Libya. A UN team in Libya has reported that at least 12 civilians were killed in two separate incidents Friday at the town of El-Kawkab in the centre of the country as people tried to flee. An earlier UN report also said that dozens of people had been killed during clashes in Benghazi, in the western part of the country, while another UN official told Reuters the death toll in Benghazi reached at least 80. Libya s crisis and U.S.-Russian standoff sparked a spike in oil prices that pushed them above $130 a barrel for the first time. Russia on Thursday banned all oil and gas imports from the United States, an unexpected step that raised the possibility of a global supply crunch. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 5.4 points at 13,459.96 while S&P 500 rose 9.04 points to 1425.49.
