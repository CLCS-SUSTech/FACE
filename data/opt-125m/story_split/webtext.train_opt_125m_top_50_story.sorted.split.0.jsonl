Asking prayer is an integral part of the Catholic church.\n\nIn reading about the devil, ask yourself ``Lord, why did Satan kill me, and why is that so?'' (John 6:14-15). If the devil is the devil we must pray for. If the devil is the devil, we must pray for this devil.\n\nIt is also important to tell and remind yourself that you have to be aware of these words in order to be believed.","token_len":111,"entropy":[4.0641,6.9561,8.2375,7.6772,13.523,1.6421,9.5626,4.0329,2.6487,1.3164,4.353,2.2246,1.4047,5.4059,5.6256,6.3984,2.1795,2.909,4.5781,0.0516,0.0032,1.2778,4.8233,4.508,1.9928,2.2219,0.0063,3.1018,6.0165,4.3261,1.1201,6.0187,0.6062,6.5317,0.9293,6.0985,6.2575,0.3022,2.7521,1.7948,2.3986,3.8891,3.1792,2.2535,1.1792,0.3326,4.1254,3.6932,2.2359,1.3859,0.7017,2.5819,2.8088,2.8463,0.0122,3.6417,1.7347,0.6605,0.3305,3.2867,2.5018,1.1452,1.4486,2.7861,2.005,6.2217,2.5479,3.5218,0.7688,3.0783,1.9305,1.2384,0.1292,0.1364,0.909,0.3121,1.7431,0.8049,0.5327,0.9605,0.1151,6.5994,3.7367,0.4631,1.5247,0.0002,4.2298,0.3936,3.7963,0.9199,0.1078,6.1485,6.9009,4.7751,2.9266,0.7834,2.7038,2.7053,2.5396,2.4601,3.4958,0.1859,4.5182,3.7543,3.1246,0.3604,0.1446,1.9347,5.3434,0.4174]}

Not sure a kid can be THAT stupid, I mean yeah there are tons of drug dealers throughout NYC, probably more so out of the ordinary than out of the police department, but they can afford those substances and the city is going to have a hard time finding them for a while longer.\nI don't know this is new to me. I haven't seen anyone else use it in 5+ years. I've heard people complain about it.\nIt's probably due to the chemicals and exposure to that but there are also certain chemicals in place where they're not legally allowed to enter people's cars.","token_len":176,"entropy":[2.6222,8.8966,0.4769,3.7324,8.1754,0.2672,5.3513,4.8837,8.468,2.5873,5.8627,3.9422,6.1627,7.2354,5.258,1.8787,2.7739,5.5635,0.431,0.2138,1.0527,3.5462,2.9652,5.1845,3.5643,3.9548,0.0067,2.9544,2.4083,7.6888,5.3746,1.6647,11.1039,2.2957,3.7389,0.4438,4.5366,0.4915,6.4015,2.3554,1.7223,2.4212,0.8625,8.4505,1.0174,8.1068,4.5874,1.6562,2.7708,7.4938,0.9867,3.5218,3.0472,5.6127,5.0562,6.5934,4.5074,1.961,3.3771,8.9515,3.3242,2.3224,3.3759,2.825,6.6057,4.0887,0.8872,3.8885,0.1011,5.2672,1.3764,7.2124,2.8267,1.5054,5.8622,2.7726,2.9998,6.881,1.4538,2.0625,6.708,2.1703,3.2399,0.0366,0.9417,6.6526,2.5608,1.7647,0.7913,3.0365,3.0469,4.397,4.3848,7.0548,1.769,3.0148,4.2256,1.6676,4.1328,0.4916,2.7845,2.001,3.5038,0.0051,3.5284,1.5751,3.7583,2.4227,1.5918,5.837,0.6812,2.017,5.4462,3.0062,0.0009,0.9935,6.2298,2.2386,4.6228,1.3477,0.9762,1.9378,1.1547,5.2097,0.0006,2.0714,3.6583,4.3622,3.904,3.6181,1.9989,6.7433,4.5242,0.0738,1.2391,1.3998,2.0078,2.9186,2.8512,4.466,0.3989,1.0777,2.5648,3.1682,3.5204,0.8665,4.651,5.991,0.0469,1.0927,8.1773,2.4659,7.5719,1.2554,4.519,6.1947,3.6206,1.0908,3.7623,4.8325,2.2694,2.0913,6.7142,4.5825,3.4629,2.5559,1.9232,7.6341,1.8998,1.0654,3.7912,4.6327,0.3112,5.4279,0.8781]}

Maybe a good, free, songwriter type of rap would make sense for that.\nI don't mean to sound ignorant, but how is it free? Does he only put out a few hits? Or if you like that, but the song only had 1 video and it was a one track only.  If not he may have put out one song at a minimum, but I wouldn't put anything else out. I guess I just don't understand why he should be in the business of making music and that is all.","token_len":177,"entropy":[9.8453,7.2555,6.6801,7.4537,0.9472,8.477,4.4506,1.9335,6.4369,3.3007,0.001,0.9054,3.2043,7.9433,1.7058,3.9132,5.1291,3.5199,0.8929,1.533,2.2262,2.8925,2.1373,2.5726,2.9572,6.1393,5.6784,0.1544,1.5326,0.6617,1.1333,3.5149,1.4533,1.8946,5.1889,0.0046,2.0704,0.7577,3.7569,2.2922,1.8525,1.7689,1.9831,0.7745,4.12,3.1033,1.2377,0.806,0.6828,5.4081,3.7297,4.4397,5.5032,5.9201,3.5363,7.1278,0.7066,0.5972,0.7123,2.7396,5.1342,1.6321,0.3129,0.9267,7.0507,0.268,0.9497,0.0027,0.3355,4.8393,3.8445,4.6407,5.5657,4.9058,2.2606,5.5423,3.0144,7.1819,1.1179,1.5775,3.2351,3.4769,1.5802,2.4598,2.7173,1.3691,0.9703,1.8918,2.6241,0.0007,5.2113,0.7412,1.5765,6.7162,0.5855,0.4587,5.5163,3.8663,1.2367,6.4664,0.7266,5.2637,5.5459,6.083,5.0881,1.1476,2.006,1.8589,5.4598,1.3632,3.3812,4.6957,2.9729,4.248,3.6132,2.2361,5.3351,3.9081,3.3029,5.6172,3.9556,2.7884,7.0147,2.6274,2.2963,1.1636,2.764,4.4022,3.9727,4.9802,3.2395,6.9658,10.6528,5.3561,4.355,5.3491,1.3442,3.2122,0.6285,3.3967,2.3241,3.513,0.6142,8.6085,1.3787,0.7817,2.2435,3.4286,0.0007,3.7675,4.1481,3.1867,0.5422,1.4628,2.3013,3.5908,2.1218,2.7713,1.6211,0.0018,2.6213,2.1937,1.3288,5.1943,1.5591,4.6782,1.3647,1.1011,0.8018,1.8142,2.1045,3.2332,3.9623,3.1707,3.8144,0.9811]}

That means you won't learn as much from reading comprehension as the rest of us.  If the universe was that complex, there would be a lot of trouble understanding the facts to begin with.  Or you could just think of it as a \"paradox\" but a \"fact check\", \"scientific theory\", or \"hypothesis\" is more accurate and easier to understand.","token_len":189,"entropy":[9.9962,4.0866,9.5677,6.5854,2.965,9.6699,3.1272,9.1385,2.0946,8.9355,9.1968,2.4919,2.0936,5.7262,0.9294,0.9413,2.6427,9.1644,1.2809,8.5627,12.7307,1.427,4.4452,0.9942,5.5819,1.6771,1.2274,6.1819,1.2448,2.8983,0.4355,5.5472,4.8957,4.6356,0.9318,6.5167,5.1961,4.4684,0.581,1.9472,3.0633,1.5806,3.0938,2.4462,4.6539,5.4898,3.0336,0.9767,1.2711,3.3899,2.923,4.6764,1.4456,3.983,0.6405,3.5159,1.7586,1.8234,2.2898,0.5024,2.2145,7.0721,5.8749,4.7197,5.8486,1.8401,6.0031,1.0603,3.7922,6.1699,6.0598,1.7802,0.8655,6.7365,3.759,0.0291,4.5691,0.043,3.1011,0.9932,2.7106,3.8535,2.8035,5.4845,0.6919,5.2617,1.479,7.6524,1.2475,1.4862,5.631,2.0126,0.8696,6.1454,2.4784,0.8921,3.4286,1.8871,3.0011,1.6336,5.3838,7.4485,5.8148,2.5943,5.1592,3.5228,0.001,3.6256,3.5957,0.615,5.031,4.2145,2.9738,4.0553,0.0009,4.3561,5.2744,0.2882,2.254,3.3635,8.6924,0.7948,4.035,3.0585,0.0588,0.6765,0.7333,3.1595,3.7879,3.6247,1.9096,2.3763,4.2837,0.957,0.6723,3.4243,0.3969,0.3439,2.2306,1.111,0.4139,5.5727,7.171,1.5363,5.5491,5.6315,2.4838,0.0051,0.2362,1.4015,5.4454,2.5672,1.1206,1.3307,3.962,1.243,1.6193,0.147,1.0198,3.0551,5.8434,0.6023,2.3494,1.1695,5.2759,4.6617,2.3115,5.4602,4.8243,3.7436,4.7315,6.0708,5.4103,0.8151,1.2237,2.0606,6.1554,0.1312,0.0534,1.2293,5.6223,4.7093,1.737,3.1584,3.8135,0.1116,1.519,0.4821]}
