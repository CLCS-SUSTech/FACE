We were at the southern beginning point not far from the town of Lost Valley, and we had nothing to do at this point. It had become one of my favourite places and I remember every feeling of delight as I went down and took in the scenery. There are many places you can go to but the place I had the most fondest memories of was the town. There was not only a great variety of restaurants but there was always something to come off of. Most of the food was tasty and the atmosphere always brightened as you saw people enjoying themselves. There is also that wonderful area in North Alabama where you can really see what all the fuss is about. I would recommend going to that area, where there is a lot of history or touristing going on.","token_len":206,"entropy":[9.7549,2.6881,6.3003,5.7759,1.2106,3.5085,2.3626,4.6633,4.6684,1.4835,0.0236,4.8307,5.3819,3.6522,5.1956,1.9151,3.1677,2.9717,5.2004,4.9754,3.7275,4.2706,1.4239,0.9936,1.8064,1.7725,5.0462,3.209,2.18,3.3359,0.7573,2.0313,1.6029,2.5726,0.7402,6.1753,0.9623,1.4472,8.5108,1.6122,5.5238,7.578,0.1196,1.7534,3.6305,3.4848,3.7507,1.1206,5.8224,0.046,1.3869,1.6855,2.0263,3.9951,1.3172,5.6459,8.4092,4.9363,8.0341,0.9757,0.1078,0.9665,3.5076,0.1675,3.1482,0.089,1.1067,2.2421,1.8169,1.8794,6.2311,0.9438,0.4979,3.9366,2.3943,0.9754,0.7732,2.9956,4.0293,3.4028,4.8888,0.1428,3.0029,3.1699,1.2504,5.0699,1.6912,4.338,5.1435,6.5977,1.6538,5.2045,3.3899,1.1834,2.7431,2.9847,3.252,4.8958,1.4465,0.4451,1.3305,0.7698,3.4721,2.9984,1.8186,2.7338,3.519,0.7869,1.4975,1.2224,3.478,2.8488,3.9286,2.6484,3.4971,1.9112,0.367,3.4948,1.3904,0.1918,0.239,0.4852,0.9826,4.5714,3.1711,3.1919,1.1264,4.5788,3.2821,1.224,2.5788,5.2087,0.0979,3.7336,2.1276,2.248,0.7332,4.0012,1.2679,1.1667,6.6964,5.4571,1.1656,1.388,5.4815,0.6837,0.3501,2.1343,0.5695,4.5561,0.8701,2.2453,2.1261,5.1011,6.4289,0.3119,3.7532,1.556,4.9459,2.2797,2.3488,1.8143,0.6319,2.5636,2.8106,2.5466,6.0409,3.6945,4.4441,2.8136,2.9511,0.2346,1.1738,1.3449,0.2616,5.0155,1.6617,3.2089,5.0371,0.4927,1.8396,0.2634,0.0983,0.6487,2.5007,2.9308,1.7155,3.4593,1.3363,3.1733,1.3181,3.0056,5.3126,1.5124,0.8286,1.3131,1.8088,0.1594,3.557,7.3561,9.3663,10.6459,4.6292,0.1783,0.7518]}

Either way, I suspect the alien system hasn't been touched for a very long time.\nThis is one thing, but on the other hand, you have to worry about alien mech's flying around.

I've sold a few properties that are worth $80\/sqm, but the house that I bought in 2002 has been worth less than $200k more than the house that I bought today.","token_len":216,"entropy":[11.0655,1.3593,6.7479,6.3417,4.5315,2.5344,4.279,5.4041,0.72,0.8656,4.9835,4.516,3.0987,0.9516,7.527,5.7765,0.0743,7.2481,4.4908,1.4719,1.4905,1.4921,3.0351,1.8997,0.0212,5.2473,3.0181,0.3865,2.1185,7.3129,2.5748,6.3673,2.7752,4.5661,5.4509,4.1548,0.0013,1.0782,0.4171,2.7388,5.5139,6.0374,2.9774,3.8483,0.0003,4.8603,3.8966,7.6821,5.253,2.5337,0.0258,3.5305,2.667,7.1535,2.5132,3.0777,1.9312,1.293,3.6886,1.9513,3.0362,1.3533,3.5888,4.6781,1.4497,4.6176,1.7983,0.7577,1.7728,6.459,4.5492,0.7332,1.9305,0.1172,6.9385,0.58,0.2585,3.5345,1.6771,0.0005,2.1111,4.1234,1.254,4.2233,1.9009,1.3396,3.182,0.7239,1.0236,4.4354,2.6578,2.7705,1.2619,3.088,1.8393,2.7092,4.4691,1.0975,5.4462,0.1,2.6318,2.7843,2.871,2.2222,1.4125,3.7992,1.2209,3.5551,4.1245,4.1484,1.1115,5.8967,0.8975,5.7478,3.6575,5.0197,2.8136,0.0421,0.2894,0.0057,4.9864,1.4909,3.8742,0.0007,1.2048,5.2734,4.9057,1.8862,6.7622,13.1845,5.0514,1.2892,5.7508,1.5813,2.0737,1.0312,2.16,4.859,0.9816,6.0836,0.4171,1.0525,0.018,0.2421,1.5131,3.9841,5.3297,0.0007,7.5907,2.9747,4.8986,3.9088,0.1907,6.8212,2.9859,5.7206,6.7157,4.2319,2.1181,4.4966,2.6909,4.7876,3.3261,2.8734,3.6208,4.9781,6.5028,3.4691,0.8651,1.6722,4.4494,1.0118,3.8261,7.4594,0.6254,3.1251,2.7035,4.8514,2.015,2.637,5.7263,2.1452,2.4125,1.7418,1.4788,5.7359,2.7959,0.1214,0.0162,1.2807,1.2221,3.2411,4.2799,2.6353,0.9082,1.8093,2.969,5.8309,3.0972,1.9936,0.9487,3.1778,0.1914,0.4001,3.1345,4.6966,6.7872,0.8889,1.0859,1.5961,0.7168,0.2888,0.516,6.8174,0.3122]}

As part of our mission of building good character, we hope to teach our students valuable and useful skills, how to have fun, be social, be playful and enjoy life.","token_len":234,"entropy":[10.1822,10.3235,6.545,0.8748,0.0158,2.8754,8.1249,0.4528,0.3465,3.1412,2.2577,0.7389,1.7748,4.3199,4.7679,2.3805,1.7002,5.2041,8.9194,1.685,3.645,4.5904,5.401,1.2131,4.5853,6.7287,3.3121,4.7133,2.7761,4.7558,7.7927,5.0156,1.1456,4.8053,0.3542,3.3528,3.2024,2.0841,4.6699,0.1149,0.3493,4.6834,1.543,5.1441,4.4789,0.092,5.8389,3.6174,5.4039,4.153,1.5954,1.332,2.3628,3.8395,1.3768,2.6823,1.2445,6.0011,0.111,4.3345,1.247,0.7834,0.0002,3.3456,1.4158,1.224,1.7364,2.0958,1.443,0.8535,3.6511,1.6488,4.3967,1.1639,1.1854,4.8083,3.4149,3.4127,5.8121,5.1484,0.0375,4.7358,0.3635,2.4605,2.3131,0.7204,3.146,2.5899,4.8081,0.3705,4.1908,0.4399,3.602,0.7159,1.9792,2.064,0.6989,5.5262,1.3618,4.5405,0.5099,0.445,3.5181,5.1298,4.9098,2.098,2.9743,5.7958,0.5466,5.754,0.3602,2.8984,1.3675,1.0689,1.4874,3.6498,0.2688,2.7571,3.7316,2.7622,2.0956,5.7793,1.9251,4.2889,2.7181,6.0295,1.3559,0.4616,0.0002,7.1034,1.0435,2.8143,0.9269,0.2917,0.0169,4.1622,1.3407,0.0975,0.587,4.3406,5.6679,1.0722,0.0172,4.4064,1.8329,0.8212,2.0963,0.7263,3.5683,4.8817,4.0504,0.1467,5.7966,2.0722,1.3421,0.0002,3.1176,3.6376,2.4021,6.5386,0.4441,0.0059,4.2659,1.5766,6.1438,0.5071,3.5206,3.2487,5.8899,3.4758,5.2111,2.5413,1.2901,4.4695,3.8267,0.5799,1.1171,0.0002,4.1465,2.5138,3.416,0.2294,1.4905,4.3965,1.5667,0.0962,4.3387,1.8024,0.3828,2.3914,1.7704,4.529,2.5308,2.9226,0.5361,3.1265,4.3105,1.0714,4.3785,3.626,0.0009,0.9316,4.2256,2.4925,3.3284,4.688,0.5478,1.1041,0.4034,4.209,1.1538,4.5597,1.9694,0.2404,5.4167,2.7613,3.2219,0.7128,2.7992,5.9322,0.1271,5.3831,1.4382,0.9543,3.585,4.8676,0.5396,2.2571,4.8532,1.1338,3.5675,2.158,0.6383]}

It's a very common reaction for those of us who are so close to our personal reflections.

But now that they see how I did it, I'm beginning to not want to do it because I will feel like everything I do is meaningless.\nYeah. It's definitely different to me if I'm not physically active. And it's not like I'm only physically active. I still think about everything and I even try doing the occasional gym workout, but it's only a little longer as I don't have as much energy for it.

It's also right next to the Collectors Block at the Collector's Block, which supplies collector's exclusive comic cards and DVDs, or at the Collectors Block, which brings to the collector the rare and rare collector's exclusive comic cards and DVDs.\nSo which collectibles is this one special edition for? Let's find out.","token_len":249,"entropy":[11.1409,11.6372,1.9878,3.5755,10.0584,11.5955,1.6766,4.0708,15.6643,2.6128,1.1659,10.773,3.3667,0.7286,1.5048,4.8963,6.6888,1.2161,5.1163,1.6365,1.6026,5.2817,5.0574,0.2712,7.6037,0.6231,5.356,2.0604,9.3293,1.4605,0.4804,2.1681,5.5317,0.6336,1.1382,0.4658,0.8478,0.07,0.4484,5.3632,4.5717,2.1991,0.8762,0.8223,4.1278,3.2981,3.9336,0.8403,0.1486,1.8582,1.0063,0.8663,3.3549,3.665,5.5416,2.1431,5.3097,2.7683,1.8033,0.6586,5.8259,2.9267,2.2286,5.7189,4.6066,3.4777,5.0865,2.8168,1.8064,5.2308,1.1593,3.4721,0.3841,1.2125,0.0157,0.0002,0.114,1.5053,3.92,8.1882,0.0044,0.5809,3.2241,0.0659,0.6227,4.3285,0.8178,7.289,1.8212,6.3701,5.1754,5.7179,0.2707,0.3413,3.12,1.9337,4.4328,0.1977,8.0004,0.8982,1.5173,2.9626,0.4488,1.5905,0.9743,4.4936,1.2083,3.6037,1.9149,6.8,3.2506,1.189,1.2257,5.0672,0.6558,4.762,6.8536,2.6469,5.21,2.1873,3.4786,5.8607,5.632,2.154,4.7625,0.767,3.335,7.0184,1.862,4.6661,0.2266,1.0528,0.3145,0.0162,0.0134,0.0006,5.0542,2.1278,2.0687,4.1065,2.1411,5.3145,0.1528,3.4742,6.3551,0.2371,1.2056,2.5994,0.3475,4.8961,1.9739,0.8319,1.5946,1.5682,2.1312,0.8912,1.0084,1.2455,3.7908,0.6451,4.5688,3.7057,7.4632,4.3699,0.5318,3.9386,7.3162,2.3329,4.9524,0.8864,2.5051,4.0209,1.9022,2.6327,0.1374,2.0915,3.903,6.9976,5.0003,0.8297,0.4226,2.9292,0.7961,2.8603,5.1302,0.9036,0.4911,0.3807,4.8561,2.3701,6.0915,3.0118,0.4184,4.7215,0.3408,4.2003,1.8624,1.6586,6.3821,4.4456,1.2934,5.9041,2.8653,2.7823,1.6569,6.5296,2.1012,4.9369,2.9802,0.4547,2.8293,0.1129,1.5347,2.2533,0.6065,5.5521,4.5036,2.2556,1.6449,3.0192,3.698,2.0524,2.8387,2.1879,0.4666,4.0399,2.1428,2.3837,0.4823,0.7679,0.7926,0.6566,4.9346,5.7103,4.2571,1.185,2.4272,3.3016,1.8551,5.1205,0.9178,4.3395,0.2765,3.9475,0.4839,2.07,0.0054,1.7446]}

Some like to know that wizards have magical powers, some don't but some don't and it takes the work of a wizard to be able to tell where that is.","token_len":250,"entropy":[7.9588,1.4956,7.9274,5.3964,4.262,1.5544,9.0164,0.7066,0.0738,0.8257,0.0784,0.0128,6.7479,1.0505,7.7916,10.2092,2.8335,9.5375,0.9084,5.5904,1.9701,4.7776,1.0055,1.8283,3.4918,2.9567,2.9867,6.1995,4.0312,2.4136,6.1108,3.6327,1.374,2.6182,3.7701,2.2033,2.1503,1.8532,10.1688,0.4095,2.102,0.5411,3.3578,4.6159,3.8016,3.3276,0.3004,4.7583,1.3497,1.4347,3.5472,0.6134,4.3019,1.4045,4.4584,0.0878,2.1859,4.8614,1.1973,4.6431,3.7385,6.7545,3.8395,1.1078,1.8075,4.9121,5.1039,4.77,1.6969,6.319,3.3269,1.0604,4.4957,1.6963,4.4458,2.6766,0.5928,6.6929,1.7132,3.1188,4.3973,7.7378,3.0526,1.5746,2.3746,0.0002,3.1134,0.7311,3.3814,1.4037,5.2193,4.0866,5.5944,0.1133,5.5625,4.0384,5.7242,1.1979,2.5189,2.2129,5.1619,0.9904,0.0176,3.4759,2.3395,6.5864,1.8778,5.961,1.2308,2.8191,4.2528,1.2818,2.5667,1.9491,1.5038,0.0004,4.147,6.6438,1.0463,7.916,6.8258,3.7608,3.0665,2.7576,3.5212,0.4255,0.0753,1.9052,4.352,1.5529,1.9651,1.4977,0.3904,2.7469,1.3702,6.7217,6.3782,2.2538,0.1788,0.2128,1.1239,2.3923,1.0309,1.6083,5.6242,2.8148,4.43,4.2541,0.8882,1.1835,8.2418,4.8031,3.5024,2.044,3.7665,3.6703,1.2007,6.012,2.2903,1.2019,4.3123,2.4105,0.2232,3.3207,4.1497,2.4673,6.1342,0.0004,6.5114,1.4527,2.4838,0.9587,0.5398,3.4144,3.2985,2.2098,3.438,0.2663,2.7399,3.0295,2.1268,3.4737,3.2394,1.6882,4.7972,5.5185,3.3641,0.5475,3.7684,4.8418,4.2739,1.4408,3.1392,1.3606,3.6728,2.9573,1.6596,5.106,1.6167,0.8573,1.2923,3.2874,3.6868,4.3424,6.3228,4.2927,0.4797,5.4006,4.6168,3.4111,2.0884,6.659,0.2488,2.3901,1.7068,3.2892,4.7377,1.0102,4.6002,2.535,4.2772,2.6837,2.3687,0.2968,1.8542,0.9144,1.1635,0.0002,3.7889,3.0269,2.569,0.0012,3.1603,3.6591,2.6989,4.9353,4.3152,0.9533,2.5651,2.4612,0.8468,3.9881,0.9984,0.0016,3.6577,5.4706,3.4401,2.8696,0.9197]}

Puck was a member of the Royal Society of Literature and was an active member of the Society for the Protection of Women. In his later life, he was regarded as a worthy opponent of the law, which he strongly opposed in his late life.","token_len":252,"entropy":[5.9855,6.9373,1.906,0.668,4.5904,4.3024,5.2702,3.2837,1.5365,2.2295,1.7025,4.6364,0.3409,0.9097,7.6065,2.5282,3.7092,3.8218,0.509,0.8178,3.9046,0.7641,0.4018,1.5334,4.5677,0.3715,4.0129,0.5112,5.2347,2.1852,3.3359,0.2383,0.8293,7.8902,1.8417,4.3642,0.0027,1.5733,3.475,7.2846,2.5224,9.3457,0.0093,2.7888,7.7311,2.6045,3.8441,1.8054,7.9077,0.6048,7.7356,1.1683,12.437,1.3995,1.938,0.0247,2.7144,6.8639,1.6758,2.0594,3.4375,0.015,4.46,1.245,7.411,1.1394,1.7298,1.3232,0.9749,4.8221,5.1433,5.8575,5.0593,0.265,3.5023,0.2794,3.5288,5.8505,1.5188,1.1155,5.1439,0.9624,0.1859,8.467,3.0174,3.5754,3.1248,2.4345,2.2368,4.8998,0.7525,2.5431,2.9828,3.6545,4.255,0.9324,1.6475,4.0252,0.0373,4.9851,0.4827,0.9202,1.1208,0.8192,6.1121,3.0354,5.2273,1.0885,2.7871,5.8478,1.9927,3.4243,3.5076,2.6223,4.0086,0.0011,4.3065,3.5935,0.2593,3.8051,0.7775,3.382,3.413,5.7976,0.3929,0.4406,1.5062,6.537,0.7147,4.4568,4.4436,1.5518,0.2675,2.154,2.007,3.6812,4.7964,4.6255,5.3593,0.0488,0.6702,2.6041,0.4863,3.0652,0.0079,2.2848,4.4475,2.4007,0.135,8.0045,0.7969,2.4439,4.8236,6.0839,3.7532,0.8953,1.8308,3.6853,0.0647,1.2397,1.6194,0.6877,3.3979,1.322,1.0647,6.3681,1.0817,2.8194,5.5571,3.1895,1.6546,2.6044,4.6274,3.9609,1.2934,1.9985,3.2378,3.5182,0.0051,5.5216,3.6867,3.4567,0.3017,0.483,0.2818,2.305,0.9316,4.892,4.7903,0.6501,1.7338,4.3038,0.3009,5.2195,1.3123,1.8895,0.3531,4.0661,3.4959,3.7146,1.1053,3.2109,0.0079,1.8677,2.1685,4.0412,0.0056,0.3482,2.6278,2.1294,0.6138,4.9135,1.4129,1.961,3.3236,3.3603,0.4137,0.1219,0.3679,3.7274,1.613,1.237,2.0406,0.0403,3.9524,1.409,3.5358,2.2962,4.0656,1.7652,0.5412,0.8754,1.458,6.1689,0.2305,0.9207,5.0681,4.0179,0.1074,1.1446,5.1979,1.7238,3.6099,1.9796,5.1664,0.6342,3.383,1.6646,4.8062,3.3417,0.3063]}

John and I, if you\u2019d like to have a chance to talk about our travels as a team, will be spending the last few days of July at the hotel in San Jose, and then a few days as guest to Boston to hang out with friends.\n\nIn fact, John loves to travel, we all really do. I\u2019ve always loved that he\u2019s in the states, too, and that we can do so much together. So there you have it.\n\nMy favorite place to stay is San Jose, California, and my favorite place to spend a winter time is Boston. So don\u2019t stop reading this and expect me to tell you everything you need to know about Boston\u2019s amazing, colorful, secluded streets as well as its charming shops.","token_len":252,"entropy":[3.9614,8.2723,3.3428,8.7252,2.3266,5.0881,4.6869,4.2908,6.5083,2.2951,4.4447,5.3289,9.5357,5.1584,2.9191,1.1997,0.0026,4.7456,13.3113,10.2294,3.1595,2.3757,5.8679,0.1128,3.1737,6.2657,1.2656,2.838,3.1456,1.8426,1.6275,4.0589,2.8635,0.2505,1.786,2.3441,4.8145,3.7274,2.706,9.2965,4.1118,2.5089,2.5579,2.5936,0.2553,1.4236,1.9984,0.0325,4.7524,2.562,0.8369,1.1472,2.6921,1.1568,7.0026,2.267,6.9797,5.4474,4.9812,1.1507,0.0772,0.3908,4.944,1.77,7.805,4.3717,6.1785,5.9182,0.0587,2.5427,1.2191,5.9348,4.5278,1.3256,2.4714,3.1632,0.2487,4.894,0.1258,0.8854,5.4572,0.1095,0.4715,4.1035,0.7003,4.0619,1.9181,4.5433,3.6305,0.8936,4.5371,5.1211,0.206,2.0016,0.0171,3.8877,0.2822,1.1279,4.2282,1.0145,3.397,0.4266,2.2572,0.493,3.3033,3.7693,4.9133,1.6642,3.382,0.2176,2.9243,0.4559,5.7016,1.3202,5.3638,1.5075,0.7627,1.319,4.0346,2.0793,1.2203,5.8768,1.5015,3.802,3.5072,0.6088,4.6712,2.4011,4.9368,0.8958,0.8518,5.4652,4.687,4.1257,6.7736,2.8363,4.5152,0.0621,0.859,2.944,1.7122,2.3336,0.0003,4.2548,2.9483,0.0456,2.6584,5.9538,1.6305,3.2611,1.4646,5.9714,4.5999,5.6949,0.9258,0.6494,2.4647,3.9407,0.0413,3.4339,2.674,1.9333,4.5142,2.3962,3.1117,0.014,0.3241,4.9686,1.6954,8.1404,0.8715,6.1412,0.979,1.2616,2.8979,2.1312,3.0257,4.4175,2.7979,0.159,2.285,0.7687,3.0538,5.0477,2.4514,0.5508,0.0171,0.9443,1.8137,0.0002,4.7421,3.4513,5.7178,0.481,2.3458,1.3865,4.2504,0.2503,1.1678,1.6843,1.1949,1.84,3.7537,0.4446,1.2004,0.2278,2.7411,1.6813,5.2944,4.0328,0.4602,2.0393,0.6233,3.8851,4.9387,1.1589,0.2525,0.0064,4.7716,2.5745,3.1235,3.1257,8.1703,1.6867,0.0695,2.1386,0.0324,3.0124,1.0803,0.571,0.0079,0.0016,0.2281,1.4381,8.8212,0.0279,1.1912,4.8898,3.6098,5.035,0.9354,6.105,1.4371,4.6375,5.8224,1.1417,0.005,1.3972,4.838,5.9396,1.8645]}

There are a lot of little things to do and I enjoy every once in a while but most of all how fun it is to live here.\nYou should go to bed at 0630am here in Colorado because everything else starts to suck.  I just realized it really sucks being one part of the west, but I'm ready to face it.\nI've gone to sleep for a month straight. Even when it's the worst I've slept for in a while, it's still there. I miss working. That being said I still get an hour of sleep before 5am and I work for a company that does well on holidays, so I'm not super hungover and it's the work that keeps me from falling asleep early.","token_len":253,"entropy":[6.1525,1.6238,3.6394,5.308,1.6938,2.6065,3.2869,0.0819,3.7013,2.0356,5.6508,7.034,3.4088,0.5647,1.6092,6.7757,0.7528,5.1034,2.2742,6.0257,4.4454,3.5599,1.2583,0.7386,2.3235,0.2352,0.4812,1.6378,11.4276,2.3789,4.1878,4.0389,2.3313,1.7319,2.8254,3.5181,3.0297,1.5559,1.5635,3.0806,7.0082,2.484,0.0591,6.6032,0.1178,0.9082,1.405,1.3811,6.1911,0.5786,2.4449,4.942,5.3068,3.0667,2.5862,0.2423,1.2015,3.9518,4.9637,0.9708,0.0001,1.4166,2.2501,4.4818,1.7264,6.0905,0.2052,3.2615,1.1296,3.1087,4.2481,2.5918,4.2952,4.7525,0.1777,0.0004,0.6385,4.0904,2.6425,2.7861,0.4104,1.4268,7.288,8.6411,5.164,0.7151,2.6934,3.4395,0.0795,7.7898,5.1199,1.5686,1.6902,1.9304,2.7009,4.4743,0.8126,4.5619,4.5848,5.9305,1.2537,2.0104,5.163,1.1855,1.8967,0.54,0.0386,5.8741,1.4945,3.2834,0.7833,2.1044,2.4576,4.5753,5.2347,6.1466,0.0546,0.5599,0.0075,3.7866,4.4732,0.2551,1.6125,6.715,6.6382,0.7113,0.2608,0.627,1.6299,2.139,0.525,1.4581,3.2992,4.0645,3.6963,1.1591,2.4628,2.426,8.2933,3.257,4.7893,6.7925,1.6709,2.1859,4.4168,6.4252,3.6708,4.1768,2.339,5.9484,0.8464,0.7339,1.7545,4.6768,5.6222,3.1902,5.1913,0.5567,5.3551,7.0792,7.1705,0.1566,1.1605,7.5766,3.3463,2.4251,1.7579,1.8716,6.5643,0.599,6.3891,1.8449,0.8328,1.1567,1.7958,2.7669,4.983,0.7963,2.1379,3.8186,2.0835,2.9834,4.2536,1.7099,6.8055,2.8989,2.703,0.6096,4.062,3.7593,2.463,2.6649,4.0622,3.1719,3.1807,1.5193,1.1468,1.472,1.7026,0.9969,0.658,4.4153,0.3995,2.4924,6.051,5.198,2.9296,6.2816,5.8147,0.0097,2.283,2.2963,2.8488,5.1352,1.1245,1.0333,0.1824,5.6212,5.7293,1.7414,2.0826,1.3161,4.9685,3.1763,2.3164,5.2123,1.4458,2.9385,6.6513,3.9164,5.0075,2.6375,1.224,0.8953,1.639,2.3477,6.0689,6.5967,0.9342,3.1605,3.1748,0.6859,4.5793,5.4637,1.8303,1.8251,0.0796,3.3986,3.0582,0.1965,4.1454,0.588]}

I'm a little unsure of the nature of that fight, but I don't think the opponent is going to be very big or small.    The only thing I can think of that I would put myself in that situation is if he attacks from the front, or just for cover, then he would probably beat most of the larger stages.\nYou're right, I'm not sure exactly which stage to fight in, but I do wish I could beat the rest of his main stages, because that would be awesome.","token_len":255,"entropy":[5.3952,0.6477,8.1576,2.6763,1.6327,13.047,1.8945,4.9183,1.7625,6.0277,0.9382,1.2085,3.6078,1.6174,3.5331,3.9441,4.0069,3.0583,4.5826,1.335,0.0907,2.9052,5.6681,5.5676,1.4204,5.6117,0.8989,2.0654,6.3054,4.6495,3.1007,1.6564,0.0147,6.7556,4.7725,3.52,8.6261,3.6146,2.9548,3.7305,4.7025,4.7383,7.7945,5.6962,0.7034,3.2166,0.989,7.6305,2.1642,2.6114,1.5133,3.4043,5.0035,9.2988,0.2702,3.9523,6.5046,2.0894,5.3582,1.1874,3.3694,0.0007,2.4025,2.3341,0.9483,0.4677,0.0385,4.2836,1.9125,1.2693,2.4577,3.2788,5.7633,0.5061,3.802,0.6694,1.193,6.1232,2.1285,2.7437,0.9304,2.281,5.156,4.2998,2.3326,1.7782,2.68,1.2915,2.8809,5.7424,1.3767,3.2854,3.3382,3.7858,2.4625,2.1066,2.7243,4.3078,0.2932,0.2992,1.5432,0.6545,1.04,6.8574,5.1317,3.4823,2.1251,3.5272,2.5388,1.9099,2.7368,3.7174,1.9382,6.8826,3.9738,4.9448,3.8413,1.2387,3.14,0.5324,3.9212,6.4908,3.397,5.0747,1.1166,3.0082,5.4014,1.5015,1.664,5.3459,5.221,1.9995,4.6292,1.54,1.3304,0.0075,4.0724,1.7323,5.0699,1.2793,2.2865,2.4424,1.3145,3.3862,4.1333,6.4435,1.2866,2.0498,2.2459,2.1577,4.4548,1.7083,3.7849,2.6402,2.1463,6.3458,0.0323,2.8084,4.0004,1.4374,0.4425,0.8254,3.7248,0.0007,0.7114,3.759,3.8332,1.609,1.966,0.0114,0.9499,3.0114,4.9646,2.3678,5.5623,0.9563,1.5504,1.6638,3.2961,4.2523,2.525,1.0935,0.5138,1.4947,1.7134,0.1282,1.8129,1.7042,1.8655,5.8224,4.6185,0.4014,3.5107,1.5097,1.0456,1.6621,0.5591,5.3924,3.5921,1.4338,2.8649,1.7405,2.4759,4.4712,5.2518,6.1823,1.7654,3.207,1.4782,3.0783,1.6131,2.9103,1.4598,0.1353,0.1753,3.685,0.4406,0.4884,0.9803,3.8861,2.3923,4.2775,0.7627,1.2834,2.1791,1.6384,0.504,5.4224,3.9293,1.9092,3.1531,1.3464,2.2688,1.3706,0.4793,0.822,3.1803,6.6704,2.0458,0.646,3.7982,1.5296,4.6214,0.3419,5.5568,3.7917,2.1934,2.1217,2.7941,3.0484,1.3961,0.6162,2.8035,0.451]}

That means they cannot see themselves as a person. And so they see themselves as being invisible.\n\nBut there are also certain qualities that a person has as a person. And as people they are invisible to themselves because there is no one to see them. If you let a person see you, they have no more than a simple illusion or an illusion that is invisible because they can see you, and they cannot see you, but they are unable to see themselves as invisible because they cannot see anyone.\n\nYou can only see or recognize yourself if you have an invisible and non-visible person sitting between you and the other person\n\nSo what does that answer you? You can see, feel, or perceive as invisible. But you cannot recognise an invisible person.","token_len":256,"entropy":[10.3702,4.6777,9.8953,6.1734,4.3257,0.7702,2.5346,1.0581,8.2586,1.7653,8.8434,4.8344,2.5319,2.6037,1.7514,1.7376,1.3944,2.5834,0.7375,2.5394,3.4863,2.0081,6.36,0.7908,0.8115,1.4668,4.1209,3.6687,3.2433,1.1023,4.6544,0.9049,3.1817,1.6819,1.876,2.4192,2.2393,5.4691,3.9947,3.1621,4.102,2.8545,1.9448,6.8287,2.6332,1.577,1.9548,5.8236,0.0069,5.0292,2.8476,5.2242,4.0158,4.3324,5.2781,3.6682,0.0005,3.0498,4.7224,7.4306,1.965,2.8263,0.5986,4.9477,2.9726,1.1679,1.2362,3.3928,1.7713,4.0335,3.3624,3.4253,2.6915,2.8426,1.9383,0.8902,1.0165,3.265,5.5048,0.9521,1.9043,2.5611,2.0679,2.2246,2.8214,0.8829,1.853,4.9183,0.0003,2.6729,2.5353,0.4868,1.488,4.9523,3.0436,2.0678,2.061,0.1327,3.1203,0.9063,3.595,4.0327,1.3335,3.8257,1.2047,1.7967,3.0986,2.8099,0.8964,0.9434,2.9829,2.4163,1.0678,3.0615,0.8354,0.2653,3.5319,0.7948,1.3589,1.4425,0.0038,3.5612,3.197,1.13,3.1166,4.6015,5.469,0.6969,4.1895,0.3696,1.443,4.331,0.5726,0.6827,1.2785,2.8902,4.6781,4.4525,5.0507,1.8167,2.7185,0.9432,0.3223,2.798,3.6562,0.755,0.4684,2.138,1.741,1.1698,0.3,0.4946,4.1854,0.9652,6.0456,3.2502,0.3043,0.7641,0.568,0.7327,1.3862,3.9229,0.5998,5.7985,2.8587,1.5536,5.4735,4.7398,3.8428,2.296,0.7127,1.6898,2.9593,4.0364,3.9167,0.8856,2.3735,1.6775,1.8371,2.3833,1.5335,1.2591,2.441,0.3141,0.4745,2.5458,2.8289,0.5372,2.2369,6.9843,0.0227,0.3656,2.8216,1.2544,3.9546,0.7119,0.3022,1.3591,0.2884,4.0058,0.5899,1.6501,0.0001,3.8743,1.6467,4.5728,1.0579,6.093,4.6519,2.6577,2.2922,0.2092,1.9617,2.7874,1.1304,5.3127,3.0872,0.1338,0.3066,2.0444,7.1078,4.6084,0.1103,0.458,1.8655,1.6719,0.141,7.1215,0.0001,2.8638,2.931,2.3786,1.3002,8.4067,7.575,2.3974,3.2181,1.1213,2.4801,3.9632,4.8986,0.1493,2.9029,3.1023,3.7184,2.7309,1.7581,1.5843,1.4462,1.0119,6.3806,4.8342,0.2375,0.1323,1.7491]}

But when I started in France, it was a new country and we started to learn about each other. I grew up in the village of Vichy de la Plata. I went to a convent to read to them. I spent some time in France there and after a while I realized we were really alike. I also realized the French have a more progressive culture that France has. If you go and see any of the places in France where French are a large percentage of their population, all I could think about was that I wanted to go to these places and I know that they have good culture, but I also know that the French and the Americans are not really alike. There is a difference. I just want them to be both cultures. I can really imagine myself as a foreigner in their country.","token_len":258,"entropy":[5.1634,5.7631,3.9574,5.2588,9.4093,2.2135,4.2329,6.594,2.7632,3.3502,5.413,5.5785,5.3393,2.7944,7.5009,3.2372,0.0062,5.892,4.3947,0.0002,7.0047,6.0256,4.3297,0.0005,8.3378,1.902,3.9896,0.1778,3.1897,0.8882,2.3572,0.0045,4.1067,0.4585,1.1932,0.0002,3.1615,4.2371,0.1837,0.0608,0.0195,0.0182,9.8425,2.9202,3.9061,0.9597,18.5426,4.7127,5.3694,2.8751,5.2451,2.7775,1.5927,2.6044,2.216,3.2607,3.9011,0.908,4.8645,2.1982,2.6487,2.7596,0.07,6.0449,5.4236,3.3019,1.4107,2.784,1.3655,3.707,0.5583,3.7239,2.6035,4.4536,4.0185,1.6999,1.2071,0.1597,3.1277,1.2986,0.2056,2.6369,0.9838,0.2655,2.0669,1.4577,0.3814,5.2071,0.27,1.2098,3.6162,1.2977,4.2646,0.9229,3.3491,4.0743,0.6243,4.1412,3.3629,3.8493,0.9216,2.8105,0.3965,2.3201,4.1731,2.5208,2.2647,4.4231,4.3068,1.4506,3.243,2.3198,2.7681,0.0271,1.0893,1.9909,4.7579,0.0504,0.7591,2.0207,4.9623,0.619,4.2461,2.7814,0.039,5.6541,1.8841,4.8721,0.8956,2.3996,1.4808,2.897,0.4359,3.0286,5.0142,4.8793,4.1938,3.9673,4.8224,1.4724,1.1723,4.4613,4.1633,0.2636,1.3851,3.1187,5.6324,2.2145,4.728,1.298,0.7535,1.1732,3.679,3.8923,0.9655,3.3592,6.3224,0.4811,1.5119,4.3582,3.7895,3.4149,3.2237,4.3796,1.2054,4.9142,4.4581,1.6832,4.0163,4.1518,1.3668,0.8198,5.3612,0.7266,2.5129,5.1593,2.5322,4.7586,1.7708,0.538,3.5698,1.6429,0.9994,2.6082,4.5391,2.7721,4.1524,5.8505,2.4173,0.2585,2.9018,0.6201,0.4155,5.5418,5.154,2.9161,1.2907,0.7779,0.6987,3.0913,2.8221,3.8996,0.1015,1.7394,0.9914,4.1445,0.2499,1.392,2.0041,5.2363,1.5852,2.2392,2.0538,3.9984,4.013,1.8317,1.7909,1.3679,2.2804,0.9969,0.3221,2.5483,1.1604,5.58,1.2585,2.7749,1.288,2.5678,3.8824,1.3968,0.4935,4.1625,1.4058,1.0977,2.0499,2.0281,1.8651,4.1509,2.0136,4.2383,0.0943,2.1599,5.6637,6.0716,0.7493,1.5988,4.3639,5.817,5.2474,4.7225,2.539,0.9146,4.0923,1.8699,5.4063,1.6786,0.9772]}

Describe how it has been changed to the masterpiece it is today.\nI've seen the work of many different artists, most of them I've only watched, and it's not as good as they made it look. There are quite a few of me in their works too. But I did like the art I did see, mostly the original art.   My issue is that it was hard to see from the perspective of this artist. It's my favorite thing to watch because the canvas isn't moving really fast, but it's not moving as fast.\nThat's fair. To each their own but the artwork I had seen in previous works was a pain to look at. I just saw it as a sculpture. The other side was nice to look at, just as you described. I guess I just didn't see more than a simple canvas or two :)\nThe canvas is definitely in the form of painting. The artist may have been more focused on trying to find a \"original\" painting then he or she was. As for what it looks like today, I think that I would have found the same paintings on a much more varied scale without the artwork.\nThat totally makes sense. My bad\nnp.

{"id":2733,"ended":true,"length":247,"text":"A therapy session for a superhero experiencing an existential crisis.\n\nThe book The Crisis of the Dark Knight follows Bruce Wayne (Dan Stevens), the world\u2019s superhero, on a mission of finding an end to the Dark Knight. He is inspired by the story of King Arthur (Arthur Miller), a great writer whose story begins with Arthur's father (William Gibson), and who eventually learns that there is power in this power.\n\nThe book also centers on the development of Bruce and his personal struggles with his mental illness, as well as his experiences with bullying and intimidation by the Dark Knight.\n\nOne particular chapter describes Bruce and his relationship with his mental health issues as they are reflected in the first two chapters. In the second chapter, Bruce\u2019s relationship with a superhero character comes to a head as he meets a stranger in the library. He is confronted with the very real possibility that both of his powers may have been compromised. Ultimately, Bruce must confront his mental illness that he did not have in mind when developing a superhero character.\n\nThe second book brings to readers a real-life moment in the Bruce Wayne-Arthur Miller series.\n\nThis book is a short, entertaining read. It\u2019s worth getting excited about.

I agree that love is important, but if He is all powerful then I know that we could do that, too and I also feel that if you love love, you can have a God like Jesus that doesn't just exist.","token_len":263,"entropy":[3.953,6.3025,1.549,4.8057,0.8533,6.8113,1.0461,4.6435,0.6963,0.6651,6.3887,5.7329,6.0927,1.9618,1.8104,4.7704,9.2301,0.7534,4.9301,3.338,0.0423,4.221,9.4222,4.19,6.6114,0.8596,7.1348,4.5818,2.2128,0.5395,0.8213,0.0129,0.3729,1.5101,6.3195,2.9825,0.001,1.6654,5.456,0.7989,3.6414,1.9147,7.0328,1.5922,6.3451,1.6524,2.4165,0.4836,1.1348,4.8954,3.0454,1.1697,2.1861,3.5798,0.5108,3.5539,0.7129,2.2464,0.4735,0.0144,2.3639,4.7014,5.2557,4.6612,4.6782,3.1148,1.1008,1.1498,2.0667,3.2585,4.3922,0.744,0.9165,4.1541,2.6601,3.5816,0.0005,1.2864,0.1031,3.4422,3.412,3.6296,0.4536,3.6665,5.3674,3.1747,6.187,2.8282,0.041,4.071,7.7703,7.4754,2.4794,1.8697,3.695,5.6732,4.0548,1.9102,2.3984,0.7889,1.2625,2.9156,2.503,3.5269,4.2732,2.328,2.4896,0.0006,2.7363,0.618,3.0705,0.7468,2.4097,2.4695,1.682,4.209,1.8941,1.9415,2.2087,3.3833,0.8936,0.4133,2.3604,1.3494,5.0376,2.6295,4.6553,1.7644,1.7516,4.0032,4.8485,0.0009,4.7918,3.3049,2.3837,7.741,1.1252,2.0812,1.6844,2.5604,0.0841,6.5977,0.8275,2.1806,3.2289,2.9508,0.0005,3.8742,4.9391,1.9757,0.7076,1.5156,0.0004,0.2561,3.7154,5.3539,1.376,0.0996,3.2394,5.3148,3.6606,3.1789,1.4655,5.8216,4.7774,4.5529,5.1914,7.1157,5.0278,5.7728,2.1531,2.1533,4.9847,1.3747,6.9155,1.4549,2.6691,7.5817,0.262,3.2393,4.6603,2.4762,2.8008,2.3642,0.132,2.1815,4.8106,1.2228,5.0567,0.949,1.15,2.2956,0.485,1.1369,4.4841,2.842,2.0383,2.0708,0.3554,3.0493,2.0256,3.5508,1.6891,6.7218,0.2868,4.4672,3.4698,3.3135,3.5623,6.1869,3.6107,1.4361,3.6605,0.0759,5.224,1.2215,3.4156,4.8017,1.6262,2.4146,0.6964,2.7568,1.2067,0.3773,3.25,2.5554,0.3932,3.7782,1.2766,0.1412,3.2991,5.8367,0.8589,2.8915,3.9617,2.2534,1.7703,2.6508,1.5332,6.0822,2.4214,4.4881,4.6065,0.6659,2.5739,3.4597,2.293,5.7395,1.9978,1.5668,1.4543,3.6927,1.719,5.1472,4.1286,2.0987,2.6753,2.8977,0.0003,3.1499,4.9161,1.6582]}

It takes mental acumen to say that, even more so in a conversation I've had with a \"friend\".\nSo you're saying that, or that they have no use for themselves and don't give a fuuuuuuuuck about it?\nNo.  I'm saying that they use the word \"friend\" as a euphemism for \"friend\" which I don't think anyone can use.","token_len":266,"entropy":[4.1301,3.573,3.8159,3.8702,6.9342,4.7324,7.5482,0.3859,3.6213,3.5445,0.9959,4.5716,1.8599,1.2141,9.0589,4.3209,5.7751,3.1535,4.6434,7.0257,0.9339,6.6316,2.1912,5.8533,1.8922,6.9371,3.3685,2.4451,2.3062,4.1326,5.7201,0.1748,0.5802,3.4407,4.4497,2.563,3.4134,1.0737,4.9101,2.7627,2.4817,3.4829,2.3118,0.7663,1.0133,6.3286,0.4214,5.3843,4.974,3.5085,3.4788,1.4898,5.2669,1.1249,5.9775,1.9707,1.0694,2.7872,0.6888,5.4901,7.175,3.7506,4.4772,2.2247,0.4445,0.5875,1.3592,5.9549,4.5524,1.167,6.6289,6.3269,2.571,4.1033,4.1384,4.9341,1.1194,2.4747,0.0005,2.8962,1.8497,2.1614,2.2699,5.3852,1.8441,2.5731,3.7711,0.0003,1.8064,1.0163,3.8692,1.0508,4.2796,3.7232,2.8491,1.0,4.7381,3.2194,1.0409,2.7867,0.5133,5.5696,1.3793,2.1356,0.4673,0.2026,4.9913,0.6629,4.2672,4.8624,5.8421,2.464,1.5361,4.9408,7.1014,1.6089,3.1208,4.5186,4.3799,4.0883,0.0538,0.0003,0.3886,4.9665,5.7654,0.0084,2.1984,4.332,0.2546,6.67,5.8421,6.817,1.5627,0.9605,5.1555,0.4703,4.9171,2.5517,0.0006,4.3399,2.154,0.1373,5.8222,1.536,2.0824,4.9738,3.0175,0.1303,1.6792,2.2283,2.6869,1.1862,2.109,1.3852,0.8121,0.1889,0.0081,0.7306,3.7423,0.542,0.7405,3.0235,0.8804,2.4109,0.7585,0.798,6.1661,0.2103,0.1508,0.3529,1.0216,0.6295,2.2217,0.7939,3.3437,0.3069,3.3994,0.5935,1.9633,5.8121,6.0605,4.8947,4.751,6.169,8.0686,3.3353,0.8773,3.2386,1.5623,2.8251,3.1631,6.2894,0.9694,3.7199,2.0388,4.5686,5.3871,1.9482,0.6663,0.4576,1.9206,3.6174,1.5742,2.1644,1.2342,3.3166,4.3788,1.8594,1.5214,0.6885,3.3164,4.2024,1.7905,3.6699,3.6133,3.5225,5.9576,0.0832,6.4249,2.5419,2.738,0.0002,5.2342,0.5797,4.4145,6.2225,0.4607,1.2858,1.38,2.16,1.4399,1.4153,1.5579,1.3373,3.4556,1.4607,2.1542,3.0369,1.503,2.0773,0.6647,1.2988,4.9127,2.4145,1.5003,0.4964,0.5402,0.3173,2.8432,0.5726,4.0244,0.0314,0.5792,1.5506,1.5142,1.1634,4.5311,2.8706,1.9508,0.0004,1.459,3.0884,2.422,3.4542,1.3492]}

Our goal is to share ideas and stories with you about how we think about the human mind and how we can engage with them, so that we can make the best human thinking that works in our societies, both here on our planet and around the world.\n\nThank you so much to everyone who shared with us that these conversations can help create awareness of our human nature, and to every one of our fellow human beings who can tell us about how we relate to the human mind and the human spirit, and to those who share in the experiences of others.","token_len":267,"entropy":[7.039,4.3218,0.0008,6.0454,8.1218,1.5553,1.8314,6.2114,3.3147,0.8372,4.2599,5.6167,6.2612,1.4047,7.1125,4.6312,3.9109,4.8357,2.0195,5.7625,3.1121,3.3185,2.16,0.0003,0.9217,0.8919,0.0009,2.9742,4.4082,6.7001,1.8955,3.5185,2.8278,0.1004,3.5937,1.4436,1.8722,4.3276,3.2878,3.1001,5.783,2.283,1.2707,4.9252,3.8232,3.6089,0.1686,4.7967,4.4361,1.2777,5.0211,4.4382,1.2494,4.027,0.9415,3.7639,6.1567,3.6017,4.7653,0.0072,6.1487,3.2197,2.6186,0.278,5.7561,2.9588,6.0687,0.5348,6.1111,0.1539,5.6104,6.2682,0.2292,2.0843,0.2269,1.6127,6.6382,4.8891,1.7464,1.6857,4.1988,6.2273,0.3552,2.3498,2.8922,1.1018,5.3412,1.8926,2.888,4.77,1.7331,5.6944,1.911,1.8793,3.1717,3.8024,0.5333,1.0338,0.0002,5.0583,1.9464,5.5048,3.518,0.9422,2.3007,0.2358,2.0856,0.0004,6.8899,3.9802,2.8821,1.3412,0.221,6.7862,0.3416,5.4625,0.2952,4.7749,0.0596,2.4466,0.0088,3.5335,0.004,9.2557,0.2715,6.0998,5.0747,1.6908,0.8849,0.3911,3.4594,0.011,1.8618,0.0132,0.9206,0.0485,0.067,1.8054,0.7286,2.6796,1.048,2.3684,12.6937,9.0774,7.6092,5.121,7.4173,2.0214,3.0881,2.022,5.8536,6.4799,2.7398,0.445,5.9686,3.0229,0.311,0.1181,2.9111,3.9977,0.9629,5.4911,3.1034,1.5579,2.8442,1.7949,1.6508,3.0746,0.8011,1.3805,0.7453,0.1252,1.504,1.2285,0.6771,1.891,5.3924,0.6504,3.8436,3.0426,3.3312,0.9046,1.1555,0.3594,3.0433,2.609,1.9248,4.481,7.0433,5.2174,5.1501,3.8334,1.5764,4.453,2.7499,4.4551,3.1501,2.6648,4.0102,2.1054,0.093,1.5594,0.0501,0.1274,0.0911,0.5329,0.0002,5.0614,0.0367,2.4879,0.0196,2.6074,2.1142,0.239,3.9635,3.8317,0.0623,4.5603,5.8807,4.6755,3.5363,1.4565,5.0097,3.9045,1.8347,2.2608,2.1237,3.2826,1.2959,1.3558,1.7265,5.9663,2.4516,0.3068,2.6109,1.7563,1.1728,0.0618,0.8637,4.709,4.5816,0.9631,1.6684,2.1934,1.1332,4.3804,0.0924,2.0803,1.1992,0.342,1.7233,2.7413,1.8187,2.2873,2.2722,0.8251,1.7924,2.4,0.5354,2.3631,4.1385,1.4164,5.2778,0.9731,1.3879,0.8904]}

But there are no exceptions for those people who are afraid to get into VR because they see things differently.\nI dunno, I think people in VR don't realize how much of a death is if they die.\nAnd that makes it all the more disturbing that we live in a world where we don't know when we die.\nIt makes it all the more horrifying that we live in a world where we not only have an actual mental capacity but also think differently.  I wouldn't really say that death is \"the worst\", but certainly we'd be better off dying or dying in VR if we had any actual physical options instead of seeing our friends die.\nThat's why I'm asking for an explanation to that.

You've given me something to ponder, I guess.","token_len":269,"entropy":[4.6603,7.0708,4.3613,2.3745,4.0232,3.382,1.5802,7.2724,7.6202,1.0372,2.1398,14.968,2.1153,6.6895,5.5122,4.1995,1.4674,6.7959,4.8106,7.2302,6.9686,2.0799,5.6015,2.9683,0.0011,1.6544,9.7496,0.2743,0.6512,4.9039,1.4406,5.877,4.5009,6.6564,5.4524,3.6604,0.9575,6.5002,1.3278,0.2865,1.1845,3.9774,2.8589,5.2614,2.3921,1.038,3.4443,3.4463,1.9466,3.2138,2.0273,1.6809,1.2173,0.6497,2.3613,4.9248,3.3185,2.7418,6.3039,3.1993,4.9957,2.7676,1.3747,2.6824,0.3881,6.5445,9.3491,6.1105,1.2962,1.5819,4.8805,0.0016,4.5183,6.7472,4.8349,3.7998,5.442,4.0085,3.9267,2.6218,1.0422,3.315,1.3705,0.0085,0.7657,0.7227,1.2164,3.5994,1.4671,2.1082,3.7366,0.4496,4.8188,0.0007,1.2094,1.9365,2.6998,3.5112,0.6706,5.2105,3.7136,0.5404,3.8679,2.2665,0.7905,8.2136,2.4453,4.3456,0.0011,3.9969,0.5849,1.5287,4.0945,4.2842,2.0779,4.5275,0.0017,1.733,4.2644,1.2208,3.3198,2.7081,4.9491,0.8607,6.5022,0.9095,5.844,2.4323,6.8813,0.1563,0.6066,2.9669,3.1285,2.258,5.6187,4.9661,0.1557,3.76,1.7114,0.8215,1.6662,3.5987,5.192,1.9738,2.2081,4.1045,7.4333,1.6421,4.3655,5.3421,1.2726,2.3242,3.7108,0.0239,1.9711,2.644,1.8546,2.3403,0.4481,3.7539,2.96,0.8259,5.797,2.8397,0.92,1.1715,8.3637,4.0907,2.3303,0.0608,0.0848,0.0884,0.0381,0.0285,0.0106,0.0034,0.0027,0.0025,0.0015,0.0016,0.0024,0.0013,0.0011,0.0009,0.04,6.7218,3.9455,5.9403,1.8553,0.6456,5.5576,2.9473,0.9332,0.6601,3.4074,3.2532,1.3776,5.1363,1.4379,2.454,1.2601,2.4207,1.8749,2.3014,2.6471,0.1215,1.3299,2.6847,0.3879,1.9139,5.3799,1.2712,3.7269,5.5871,0.5863,0.0353,1.3832,4.258,3.6034,2.976,0.379,0.6753,1.8695,2.5134,4.0021,3.1914,1.7859,0.7797,3.0629,0.9555,4.9317,7.1691,3.1409,1.5863,0.0051,1.1268,0.23,2.011,6.04,4.4638,2.4027,1.1963,6.3681,3.6874,1.7293,1.2983,2.1927,4.6569,5.7466,2.8453,4.0739,0.6332,0.0009,0.8497,1.7921,6.9462,2.1575,3.672,2.8346,5.162,0.8117,4.3441,1.7756,4.2765,2.4715,3.5636,1.6396,0.3604]}

Murder is certainly different, but that doesn't make it wrong.","token_len":274,"entropy":[9.1565,6.4541,0.1112,3.7521,1.8069,7.8406,4.2119,2.0545,7.2993,1.4975,1.4879,9.3553,2.8555,6.1945,0.0777,1.7188,2.5376,6.393,2.5145,2.1879,1.2069,8.622,0.558,0.5721,5.4614,2.9668,3.0058,4.4926,6.8621,0.9717,0.6341,4.2099,2.8692,4.3729,0.8897,1.2995,9.6827,3.7569,0.0011,2.1085,1.7894,4.5368,2.952,1.6968,2.0824,1.4608,4.3998,4.7007,6.6586,1.321,4.0546,2.9028,4.7947,2.0123,3.9471,0.8991,2.9534,0.3587,1.292,3.2951,1.277,1.0939,2.2177,4.0148,5.0634,6.7154,2.4504,1.0769,1.3258,0.6824,2.1611,1.3313,3.3794,1.3086,2.8261,1.6374,0.4629,2.4776,0.5289,1.5783,4.1527,3.3139,4.2271,4.5942,3.5086,2.4789,0.093,0.3275,6.6797,1.4191,5.0019,4.1149,5.4855,0.7421,1.1074,5.7068,1.4947,5.0493,2.4866,2.7607,4.5067,1.6968,2.8158,2.0996,3.7807,1.3315,1.9933,5.1362,2.0678,3.8933,3.9787,6.5726,3.8848,5.9804,1.9033,2.903,0.6998,1.8712,4.0831,6.0226,4.9526,2.4946,1.3622,0.6523,2.0186,5.4894,5.8735,2.3492,5.5849,4.0927,2.1885,4.2941,3.5235,0.0811,5.0473,6.4517,2.7093,2.4851,1.1913,3.0906,2.8221,5.5218,0.6382,0.5738,4.8032,0.995,1.9405,4.1121,2.9319,2.5811,5.0586,3.5244,6.4947,2.2073,2.6681,3.3328,0.7611,5.5154,1.9599,0.6175,1.1706,2.7894,1.4007,0.5313,0.0151,1.2648,6.6251,0.2201,2.6552,5.7221,4.1897,4.0779,6.4071,2.2057,3.0947,2.1678,5.8128,4.5029,3.6329,2.8841,4.0719,3.8855,3.3765,1.9113,4.3779,0.8257,0.9585,5.7912,0.1731,5.426,3.1057,1.4364,2.3951,2.7425,0.0006,0.5251,3.2524,4.9539,3.4569,5.0495,1.8649,10.1823,12.7701,2.5132,1.2788,1.4552,2.4921,5.528,3.1114,1.1302,4.2519,0.0053,1.9652,2.2698,3.2872,6.0237,0.6099,5.3663,3.7483,6.5678,1.5091,3.3938,0.521,5.0052,2.0631,0.6271,2.6785,1.7071,0.8496,1.3155,1.2486,0.7515,0.7065,6.701,1.0347,0.9375,3.0116,2.023,4.3065,2.9287,2.8511,5.1096,1.4713,4.7395,1.3838,0.4061,2.7929,0.4123,0.8872,4.6865,2.0347,0.8614,5.7898,8.0639,2.3983,0.8285,0.8828,1.7279,3.1725,0.7412,7.8661,0.4821,6.3583,1.5109,1.2373,0.3122,3.238,1.2012,0.0004,2.6609,0.4144,4.0805,0.66]}

I'm just saying, the past is the current and as long as you can ignore it and enjoy it, you'll keep it at a reasonable time.","token_len":275,"entropy":[8.0456,3.6649,10.218,5.4577,2.0955,6.228,2.635,3.3514,0.6229,2.6841,2.5802,0.3283,5.3788,2.062,1.2701,7.2605,0.1496,5.1457,0.8703,7.5987,9.9355,7.7911,0.9987,4.513,5.4348,2.8785,1.6037,3.2351,4.1957,0.0008,1.5304,7.6397,1.8109,3.8941,6.3185,2.6787,2.8157,9.144,0.4429,2.0903,2.9736,2.3755,4.4166,3.3857,3.217,2.5144,3.2035,3.8146,2.7916,3.5089,0.0002,3.767,3.2922,1.8696,5.8649,1.5331,1.3773,5.3138,2.2729,0.9405,6.8921,4.1808,0.5317,5.4412,1.3489,1.7818,1.4574,3.8525,2.7763,5.6998,4.0101,4.3823,3.7276,4.528,0.9009,0.951,3.8352,2.6113,1.9842,0.6954,1.7462,2.9923,4.6839,2.4772,0.394,2.7449,0.5125,1.7653,6.3923,0.4455,1.0923,1.8765,2.2323,0.0004,1.6198,4.8281,3.8257,1.0821,1.1858,3.8148,0.2448,2.9912,6.3322,1.6724,0.1687,2.7211,7.2356,2.2913,3.9469,2.2477,3.7395,4.3206,3.7141,5.4723,6.8474,3.9628,1.7173,0.6066,6.6947,4.7217,0.7607,4.0035,6.7916,3.441,1.1621,3.8197,4.3228,2.1742,2.6126,4.2491,3.7047,5.852,4.3249,1.3438,3.4975,2.9331,4.2269,4.7289,3.5098,1.2452,3.2729,5.6949,1.6947,2.9045,3.488,0.579,2.4043,3.8943,4.5122,5.2303,3.6958,5.5237,3.6028,5.3444,4.7709,3.782,1.5192,2.1573,0.6821,3.1443,2.585,0.7541,0.4209,2.6424,3.2868,3.6101,5.5995,1.3496,4.6279,0.8994,1.18,5.8742,0.0164,4.2792,2.0199,1.6804,2.1455,2.7427,0.0005,1.9581,1.8181,3.8459,2.1908,1.6983,0.8145,6.6149,1.6071,0.4016,4.3859,4.1804,0.1301,6.1605,3.763,0.7983,0.8075,7.9548,2.5721,0.8144,5.2708,6.0043,0.5926,2.9108,1.5039,3.2851,2.7111,3.0585,4.3472,1.1162,7.9943,0.5383,5.5707,0.4524,3.6067,0.9187,5.2438,2.5821,1.4706,2.0679,2.5377,5.7544,1.9201,4.5187,2.6454,5.207,5.4449,5.9621,4.7323,2.8131,1.1484,2.7567,0.0005,1.4259,0.9318,7.1806,1.1736,1.9382,1.3144,1.3001,4.3403,1.9937,1.6612,0.5351,5.6472,2.0167,1.6898,1.4553,2.8678,1.2902,3.9488,4.4175,1.0001,1.9508,3.8482,2.7336,5.7587,1.6649,0.0112,0.5273,2.5742,5.4412,1.1971,2.764,4.3242,1.2806,0.5175,0.8907,1.343,4.2474,3.3462,5.0916,2.1792,2.6661,3.7973,0.4385]}
{"id":784,"ended":false,"length":271,"text":"In the Toy Story world, you are one of the few toys that fall behind the shelves of a department stores and are stuck there for years until they are changed. What is your story?\nI spent my whole childhood reading books I hated, most of them I just kind of turned the kids off. I have always done a lot of reading for myself, but having read a lot of children's books I have realized that reading for fun is the only way to get through life's hard times. Maybe for a little longer. I think people in general don't realize these days what kind of life they have and how much they enjoy it. That's why I decided to put a small thing like this in front of the kids and let them enjoy it.\nThe answer is: read more often. But don't just stop there. Take some time off - think of it as a vacation. Try to really let a few minutes out a day to read more than you normally do. Then get more into books that you will enjoy or maybe spend a little time reading what you want. That way everyone has a chance to enjoy that day. :)\nThat is my goal, hopefully. A vacation time for everyone would be great for me.

The Los Angeles Times says that deputies found fentanyl, hashish, and cocaine in the house where the bodies of Kenneth M. Smith and Elizabeth Elizabeth Johnson were found and that authorities found multiple drugs and paraphernalia connected to the two murders.\nThe AP says that law enforcement officials also found the drugs that had been in the homes were used in connection with the murders.\nThe LA Times says the deaths occurred at the hands of a third woman, 33-year-old Nilsa F. Ochoa, who is in police custody awaiting trial on charges that she was in possession of methamphetamine. Police say that she tried to murder Ochoa once but was unsuccessful.\n\"What happened in that house where these people lived and were killing their spouses, that I don't have the words to describe,\" the Los Angeles Times says.\nThe Associated Press reports that the Los Angeles County coroner confirmed the deaths as well as the deaths of the men, including Tania Sanchez and Kenneth James Smith, although the autopsy indicated that neither one of them had a medical condition other than drug addiction.","token_len":277,"entropy":[5.2722,10.5696,2.8297,6.6862,10.6832,7.0159,4.073,4.889,4.7705,5.2701,7.6478,4.8442,6.5046,5.3988,5.0737,1.6101,0.1041,0.7023,15.4382,2.2836,5.292,4.422,2.802,1.045,2.8484,0.0007,1.4319,1.8316,5.7377,0.0045,0.844,5.5527,2.3677,3.8632,1.7009,3.5169,4.2046,0.3762,1.0143,2.9802,2.8641,0.3361,2.7098,3.4798,3.9025,4.3956,0.2267,2.4213,0.8025,4.7793,1.3374,0.0241,5.1266,4.6313,5.778,6.0625,0.5917,1.7044,3.4452,0.0007,0.0465,3.443,1.2371,6.4001,1.7367,5.9886,2.0655,7.2747,0.1205,0.7766,2.2939,2.4442,0.6129,1.5328,4.2769,2.056,1.661,4.826,1.0338,5.6427,5.256,0.6996,4.8172,0.5694,5.157,6.3062,4.7512,0.188,0.1555,3.8425,1.7152,4.0535,2.6776,5.9041,3.2814,2.4546,3.7538,0.0,0.0,7.0896,0.0862,0.39,5.6619,1.8322,0.187,0.6596,2.655,4.1486,1.7247,0.684,5.5345,0.0189,1.5904,3.9554,0.8095,3.4485,2.5007,3.5811,3.2677,0.2271,3.4358,0.4084,4.9867,7.1217,3.5673,1.1082,6.6092,0.208,0.3667,1.1367,0.5376,0.8141,1.4876,5.3282,0.014,1.4185,2.1778,4.8857,2.738,2.3445,1.6208,4.9496,0.0007,2.2957,5.3796,4.5057,0.8749,7.2789,0.0165,0.0037,0.0047,0.0011,6.1024,5.0429,2.0013,5.3002,2.4702,5.6731,4.2727,0.0062,0.9589,0.5061,2.6485,4.0877,4.393,0.0059,3.2466,0.1909,0.8971,1.7509,2.1698,1.1635,3.0632,4.1202,1.3349,0.0198,3.5211,1.4935,3.9373,0.8977,1.4956,1.7979,5.1726,0.0504,4.9298,4.1128,0.0006,0.0002,6.5742,3.2214,1.0822,3.3077,0.8788,0.5981,2.9954,4.8359,2.0199,2.1756,1.8937,0.7376,4.4592,3.1417,2.3755,3.0545,2.4677,3.3587,4.7152,4.615,5.8087,1.607,3.4274,4.7,2.4682,0.0005,4.3046,3.0937,4.0971,0.2677,0.3399,1.929,3.1933,2.7342,0.0002,0.0292,1.9526,0.1295,0.8057,1.3691,1.9407,0.0012,1.3042,0.1491,1.6944,3.6029,0.0015,0.8304,2.6868,4.5633,1.2814,1.3659,3.2037,3.5567,0.8298,0.9581,2.3296,0.2496,2.0959,3.7649,2.4565,3.4131,5.4969,5.1078,7.8941,1.3731,4.0823,6.9067,1.3326,0.9245,6.0821,1.7843,4.6195,4.9048,0.6851,3.688,4.8805,0.6154,1.1192,1.2705,2.4655,4.7435,0.6999,6.1342,0.004,4.5143,1.495,0.2259]}

Not bad or flashy for only their age, but I think they\u2019re pretty good looking, and they have a lot to offer the queen\u2019s little boy, but he\u2019s really good looking as well.","token_len":277,"entropy":[9.9623,6.7105,10.4175,1.6509,0.5333,1.9855,4.6352,4.5945,6.2356,1.8051,1.6118,9.1536,5.0056,2.8338,6.3429,1.7645,5.14,3.99,5.8245,10.7832,1.5953,0.9836,2.3239,1.5575,0.1271,0.5894,5.8276,3.7364,2.7088,7.6586,8.2442,0.821,1.2769,0.8567,2.1916,0.0727,2.144,5.1634,1.6047,2.2514,2.4707,4.4267,5.9706,2.6393,6.0081,0.3525,0.5562,0.1952,1.6005,5.1024,5.0515,2.3943,3.299,5.5792,1.7077,5.1188,3.5906,2.8229,0.0266,2.8642,3.8885,2.8891,5.2469,0.3362,6.2879,7.998,3.7334,2.0759,4.627,4.8039,2.3247,4.7105,2.884,5.2482,1.6148,6.7735,2.5769,3.8794,3.4733,0.9472,3.8831,0.3512,2.9388,5.5484,3.5631,4.2567,2.5855,0.494,7.281,5.9906,3.1669,1.0258,3.9809,3.4758,1.0866,4.5498,4.5175,1.9719,2.8199,5.3172,1.5444,1.266,2.4821,0.4634,0.9246,5.4234,0.1668,3.0149,1.7844,0.4505,1.0814,0.8805,3.5317,2.4616,3.4228,4.3926,0.8222,2.7914,4.8766,4.953,0.8159,2.3543,0.5155,2.7221,5.0608,7.0732,2.2757,2.628,4.0575,0.3589,0.286,0.4285,1.0245,4.4406,0.9985,4.5473,2.0518,5.2761,1.3431,5.6981,6.0296,0.5007,0.463,4.7306,0.8595,2.0022,1.2427,4.6138,5.9487,0.3087,0.4194,2.2049,4.7257,1.0884,1.7843,2.2792,0.8795,3.51,2.4603,1.8083,1.9025,1.39,4.5332,4.1363,1.1333,6.6951,4.2251,0.4177,7.1835,3.102,3.0357,2.7291,2.6578,1.6011,3.1997,6.1699,1.7141,6.4937,2.5581,1.3104,7.1422,0.7697,0.5113,1.8813,0.3247,3.3669,2.3982,0.8738,2.6797,1.1889,3.0309,1.2578,4.3981,0.29,7.5228,1.6081,1.0206,1.7529,3.1577,2.5637,0.9606,0.9837,1.2807,3.6511,0.2168,0.2061,1.2145,0.0003,3.8347,2.9856,0.7652,3.5466,1.3042,0.4218,3.0756,1.094,1.7298,4.0627,2.202,3.5755,4.1234,0.7846,1.052,3.6734,2.9687,4.6644,4.0302,4.9489,3.2143,0.5837,4.9759,4.3005,6.3708,7.3757,3.824,6.5809,4.6639,1.0751,0.7719,0.3498,3.2211,1.9234,1.1384,18.3976,8.0432,3.3975,1.8146,2.9506,3.0129,3.2153,1.9834,2.0439,2.8825,1.4365,2.0307,2.4777,1.2679,2.0084,2.8758,4.8132,0.0929,1.4588,4.3269,2.4845,3.1092,4.006,3.8511,2.9736,0.06,0.0793,4.4779,4.3687,0.5944,3.3144,0.1027,0.3713]}

Also, as long as there's always the option, I don't see how it would take more money to replace them with good ones. :P","token_len":279,"entropy":[12.5498,0.2511,1.8248,2.4722,3.4813,1.2131,2.3739,10.6785,7.2759,1.4928,3.5924,8.0473,0.6283,1.9811,5.489,7.1938,7.2911,4.5879,8.2556,2.8211,12.9761,2.5352,1.0683,2.2877,5.9023,7.016,5.8709,7.8532,0.005,3.5443,6.8414,6.0284,3.1821,2.3062,4.5562,5.8542,1.28,1.6365,4.3736,4.3721,3.9997,4.8389,4.0817,2.2642,3.7202,1.7599,4.5262,2.4071,0.1215,2.8682,5.2802,4.2759,4.6162,0.0565,3.5697,5.5172,4.0893,3.7464,1.435,1.8866,2.0653,0.7199,2.2376,3.6236,4.724,4.4237,2.6831,6.2918,1.8791,1.6379,1.4978,1.7894,4.7844,4.4828,0.9149,6.0055,9.8466,3.1381,1.2888,1.771,0.7095,4.9123,0.7249,1.9475,2.2988,0.3772,1.1777,3.3953,3.2968,0.0483,3.2384,1.0225,4.228,4.9165,0.0026,4.4428,1.5365,5.2872,5.8317,3.1821,2.9163,3.2548,2.7234,1.962,2.0008,7.2468,5.5555,3.9308,2.3151,2.1279,1.159,5.3662,4.5008,3.4947,7.6909,8.4078,0.3347,4.7114,3.1771,3.268,0.1814,4.1445,0.5603,1.296,1.8834,3.0153,4.3773,4.6799,2.5533,1.9222,2.8827,6.2666,1.1139,2.8368,1.9174,4.7923,5.418,1.1456,0.6097,1.9151,3.9164,4.8767,0.1912,3.3783,5.1074,4.3566,1.3632,4.0114,2.6527,2.1934,5.6994,3.3181,3.6631,3.7713,5.2644,1.0583,2.7494,0.6513,0.6896,1.3542,0.277,4.7653,0.2173,2.357,2.6514,3.415,4.9532,2.2025,2.0352,2.2487,0.137,6.5781,3.458,2.6237,0.0021,0.9506,2.1253,3.3791,1.4043,6.6805,3.4165,2.4683,4.9618,3.905,5.802,1.4974,0.585,1.9802,1.9661,3.5016,4.1919,2.3671,0.0689,4.6443,1.9892,0.1558,2.3783,2.1505,2.2467,5.4513,1.3468,1.548,2.5136,4.2145,3.9917,1.6805,2.1417,8.2182,2.1315,1.3089,0.7922,0.6413,2.3277,5.2828,0.882,0.0509,1.3434,0.7435,2.4392,3.2503,2.6844,4.2524,4.3811,6.0236,3.6353,2.5842,2.8808,4.7928,4.3938,3.2969,0.9433,3.064,2.3697,5.0831,2.6375,3.2103,2.4074,1.3845,4.0203,4.5932,4.4496,3.2033,2.6866,5.3778,5.4547,5.8189,3.9876,2.1033,4.8366,0.3673,4.2047,3.2707,0.0018,1.9955,2.5436,5.1133,3.0898,3.2621,3.5228,2.2539,2.1253,0.0003,1.9444,1.872,1.9608,2.1078,4.8609,2.6614,3.6341,0.4685,0.5226,2.4463,2.0293,3.8764,1.6664,0.5981,6.1229,1.5751]}

A lot of the time that I see him in movies where you expect something, but he usually keeps it for hours on end where you want something, he just doesn't give as long as he wants.\nI would totally listen to him and it would take me back almost all of the way to the beginning of this film.","token_len":282,"entropy":[6.9237,7.9607,1.3148,0.8061,5.0191,6.168,2.6319,6.0288,0.2812,2.7384,1.8661,0.5126,2.5305,8.2363,1.4409,10.5497,3.3733,6.9901,8.2736,2.2849,4.7171,1.7784,1.2736,6.1243,1.8783,2.9762,4.271,3.5735,4.2959,6.0311,4.8432,1.0457,4.2802,5.3566,1.4705,5.5321,3.774,4.2097,1.9749,0.7057,3.367,0.9995,2.0194,3.4063,4.7797,2.7047,3.558,6.8061,0.8855,0.9558,1.837,4.8067,1.558,4.9557,4.7063,6.497,10.919,2.259,6.3907,6.8659,0.8975,2.1911,2.2128,3.9935,5.5508,4.4246,1.6015,4.1986,0.4926,3.1988,4.4013,3.0894,3.4232,3.5612,2.5442,2.1524,4.9464,2.5104,1.7443,3.9571,5.0638,2.2748,3.386,5.2084,1.4826,1.3773,4.1041,7.9518,2.1863,3.8182,1.579,1.9936,3.3426,0.9786,3.4356,0.3253,2.4158,3.0502,6.2042,3.7318,1.4081,3.4563,2.0832,5.8879,6.2316,5.7472,0.6664,1.6797,2.8716,7.7913,2.731,7.0646,5.647,2.5295,1.7533,3.4919,1.7692,2.1582,2.6826,0.2533,4.198,0.3919,4.1094,1.0909,2.2041,2.2069,3.4772,6.619,3.3744,2.3105,6.1115,3.9357,0.7723,2.4404,0.0615,2.3344,1.2771,1.8861,4.1292,5.289,0.3722,5.6961,4.5635,2.1529,0.0565,1.9653,2.4382,2.5591,2.3747,3.0224,3.4071,0.7958,1.1856,3.1602,6.3426,2.8921,5.5427,0.6386,1.6965,5.7743,4.3205,0.7742,0.2838,5.1665,4.9041,5.6903,0.6382,1.8306,3.8718,3.036,3.35,1.1944,0.9899,2.3273,5.4432,3.152,4.5364,4.9692,6.2225,3.8759,3.0182,2.5537,2.9883,4.7057,1.3354,7.7503,2.2484,3.6934,2.7436,2.0296,2.6822,1.3766,1.6063,0.2435,1.3881,0.3059,0.2964,1.361,5.7488,5.3374,1.3663,2.2037,4.3602,3.5392,1.5511,5.2263,6.7215,4.8767,0.2587,3.4392,1.6662,1.7573,4.3169,7.2577,4.4647,5.3164,1.5607,0.1947,2.7927,1.7103,3.7984,2.8128,4.5513,1.8293,3.2131,4.0729,4.3796,3.6966,7.3402,2.9144,2.6636,2.3448,1.4537,5.8624,4.2989,0.6411,1.0302,4.4404,2.5775,0.0131,6.179,1.479,3.8025,1.7277,2.2068,4.0648,2.2563,2.005,0.0007,1.1946,7.7733,3.301,0.6834,1.1686,1.6991,1.1244,1.499,1.7241,4.0438,4.8083,6.6042,0.0832,2.329,2.8532,5.0095,1.248,4.9971,1.1208,3.542,7.17,4.094,1.2942,1.0996,0.7485,1.0102,0.8892,2.0364,1.2902,2.981,5.031,0.5959]}

{"id":2144,"ended":false,"length":279,"text":"You're writing something new. Every single letter you type brings someone closer to their grave. [ FF ]\n\nThe most interesting thing about this book is that he goes so into detail regarding the world the book is meant to focus on while using the words \"the world\": The book is meant to speak through \"the soul of a being\" and I mean the soul of someone who is not a person. And because he says, \"I love nothing more than everything and I will do anything for it\" this book is also meant to focus on how things can change because \"this is reality\" and also how humans are affected by the events of this book. This is where he goes and shows us more of humanity. He speaks to us through our own personal experiences in his words and stories. I find this really amazing because it helps to put a face to the stories of humans. Even in the books the person is actually shown to be in the end of a different world and what that world is really like.

{"id":251,"ended":true,"length":257,"text":"You teach Basic Undead Lore at the Arcane University, so your class is at the same time composed of freshmen necromancers, paladins, warlocks and witch hunters, and maybe some classes are new to it.\nIt's a little late to post, but what about the class composition of the classes at the Arcane University? I'm having the same issue as you.  I have a feeling the class composition of the class is the difference between not having the tools to be a good Necromancer and having nothing at all to work with.\nThis is one thing, but the class composition isn't.  The reason I said \"some classes\" is because there's so little of it out there.  A good Necromancer will be very familiar with the basics of Necrocrank to them.  The rest you can just pick up with a beginner Necromancer.  You may want to look into the \"Unscribe\" classes that people use for non-warlock lore.  It takes ages to use that method right now due to lack of resources.\nThat's what I was saying, with the exception of my class, it's not only Necromancer, but I also teach some classes where you don't really get much in the way of equipment (caves and items) that you could do with your friends. I mean... I guess that would make me more proficient then.","token_len":283,"entropy":[9.5809,10.5767,12.0695,6.5456,3.8285,1.8712,5.2259,3.4206,1.8065,3.2777,4.8565,3.0664,1.5888,5.3498,1.5043,3.5652,3.1783,8.7711,0.0727,9.9652,12.0633,0.2383,0.0563,1.3798,6.1433,0.077,0.0001,0.1918,5.1936,0.1495,1.8014,6.3203,1.276,2.2278,1.6795,6.3733,1.9502,6.4716,4.8926,6.2467,0.9076,6.5425,0.6835,1.5915,7.9236,0.8809,2.1438,3.2804,4.9804,0.8781,6.4088,2.7272,0.3631,5.2239,3.2944,1.8612,3.8961,5.8322,2.5089,0.9839,2.4234,4.0233,0.9107,0.7641,0.0888,0.3046,2.5646,2.0709,5.4652,4.224,1.1781,2.1391,1.8832,1.0452,1.6121,7.771,8.242,3.1139,1.5769,5.0949,2.5687,2.3844,0.5833,1.3345,0.7269,2.735,1.9285,3.5347,7.3669,0.1177,6.5661,1.3193,2.3603,7.9362,1.8029,4.2834,0.9825,2.3571,2.9476,0.0266,1.3809,0.809,6.0601,1.1515,0.0115,2.1083,4.4509,0.1452,0.5514,1.6278,3.7669,0.9223,4.0088,3.8915,3.6526,0.7892,3.0477,2.5055,0.2055,4.0918,0.0006,4.6003,1.5303,2.2812,5.0338,1.5638,4.074,2.9755,5.324,0.5337,1.6659,0.8282,0.4761,3.0448,2.2418,2.6568,2.2874,2.937,1.057,4.7116,0.0359,0.6753,0.4259,4.7006,2.6358,1.0441,0.021,2.7696,2.0742,4.2601,3.9809,0.4704,1.4204,2.4237,0.5247,3.5162,3.7011,8.314,4.2374,5.4828,6.6409,1.7068,0.1634,2.5466,4.6589,6.5552,2.1428,2.8204,2.6485,1.0551,4.3273,1.7902,6.5416,2.5279,0.0854,1.1279,0.419,3.0585,3.9233,2.601,0.1025,3.6933,1.2684,2.1586,4.3248,5.6001,11.7596,1.2753,3.9681,3.4585,5.4304,2.8232,2.414,6.6278,0.2191,6.9731,0.6683,6.5561,0.936,0.6218,3.4099,5.1173,5.5181,0.4491,5.8942,4.0277,5.5107,6.1513,3.3689,7.1683,0.0063,3.2943,0.0039,3.1733,0.8901,1.5145,4.4033,1.2884,3.5989,0.9157,3.1546,1.9087,1.8562,5.7225,1.4112,3.1093,0.0383,4.3056,2.8366,1.7762,3.2311,0.6066,1.4377,5.6532,1.9463,1.2808,2.3792,0.6562,4.517,2.6553,3.7352,3.5,2.6538,4.468,1.743,2.9104,0.0005,3.0146,3.378,1.7287,3.3733,0.4556,0.0085,0.0368,5.8369,4.3287,6.4121,5.2978,2.9893,6.0015,1.4619,3.278,1.1217,2.6783,4.9914,1.0584,2.5793,6.9961,0.6044,3.9384,3.4058,4.9813,2.3033,5.026,2.0322,3.8969,2.4054,2.6863,3.545,5.8973,5.8379,4.4307]}

[ FF ]\n\nThe most interesting thing about this book is that he goes so into detail regarding the world the book is meant to focus on while using the words \"the world\": The book is meant to speak through \"the soul of a being\" and I mean the soul of someone who is not a person. And because he says, \"I love nothing more than everything and I will do anything for it\" this book is also meant to focus on how things can change because \"this is reality\" and also how humans are affected by the events of this book. This is where he goes and shows us more of humanity. He speaks to us through our own personal experiences in his words and stories. I find this really amazing because it helps to put a face to the stories of humans. Even in the books the person is actually shown to be in the end of a different world and what that world is really like.

The third story is about an outbreak which happened last month.","token_len":286,"entropy":[3.4603,3.9924,8.8503,7.4426,0.9344,9.0514,6.071,0.9073,5.2486,0.281,3.5946,0.0157,1.3471,5.9436,2.6038,7.1185,1.4259,4.7841,2.1081,10.9612,0.3633,5.3323,1.7823,1.8344,2.1256,2.6279,1.4677,0.6161,4.946,1.8482,8.3351,3.2719,1.9438,6.147,4.8911,6.5653,2.8803,0.284,8.9024,10.4513,4.9455,0.0042,1.1399,1.2472,0.0082,2.1734,5.0458,1.4053,1.8108,4.6487,0.018,2.5969,4.5677,2.4356,1.0342,2.4066,1.2781,3.2953,2.816,2.1414,1.9696,2.379,2.6004,0.3855,1.0821,3.6382,1.2051,6.2345,3.9866,1.1566,3.38,7.6557,1.7475,3.67,5.932,4.443,1.1764,1.4135,5.1238,2.4622,3.0904,0.0003,3.5056,2.1172,1.1616,2.2732,3.375,4.4259,6.4625,1.2773,2.8722,6.086,3.4131,2.2304,2.0734,3.2126,3.7474,5.3435,4.2383,0.471,1.4379,1.7863,2.7684,0.6334,0.8209,1.2268,0.1884,1.3932,2.4059,2.1796,5.6751,1.8376,1.0912,5.8429,0.7107,4.4021,0.3252,3.5024,2.2412,1.0755,0.0002,1.5691,1.8446,3.053,5.5283,1.2861,4.4136,0.8653,5.8093,11.6301,6.5251,3.5572,6.0591,1.7343,8.4764,4.1661,8.3041,1.8527,2.5223,2.2774,5.7565,1.7798,0.5837,1.7996,4.4879,1.4217,3.9397,0.7819,4.3312,8.0633,3.4813,7.7852,4.6858,1.8505,0.3176,0.5508,1.2729,3.9001,0.5908,1.2166,0.0002,3.7528,0.7577,3.1769,0.2772,0.4322,5.1432,0.676,2.3102,0.5399,0.2265,0.2171,0.0392,11.3347,4.0867,1.3027,1.6892,0.5492,5.2838,0.3779,1.8089,3.0509,4.803,0.1459,1.2488,0.5175,0.7297,0.5777,1.3284,0.0775,6.0188,0.1214,0.2012,1.3627,1.2532,0.0002,2.4447,0.7029,3.5448,0.1252,0.528,1.1449,0.0738,2.0709,2.2008,2.8205,4.5116,2.3316,2.4092,1.0655,2.97,0.0589,0.142,0.3269,0.2498,2.7312,1.7788,0.8724,0.7267,1.961,0.2111,0.3013,0.1722,0.0742,0.1325,0.1042,0.019,1.4658,0.0157,0.0233,1.6534,5.3227,5.9175,1.4118,4.9164,2.894,2.6842,7.1828,4.5388,2.1862,6.3453,0.6626,5.9855,1.8239,6.2857,3.0842,0.0031,2.5771,0.7471,5.0746,2.6485,1.0724,1.744,0.3052,3.9028,2.9984,8.3632,3.5919,1.6647,0.9282,3.2851,1.2008,3.3143,4.8928,3.5486,1.5509,3.3862,0.7538,5.202,2.5268,6.6104,2.2223,0.7577,2.4449,3.6121,0.2819,1.3783,1.487,2.3239,0.3666,4.4865,2.712,5.143,3.5442,1.5246]}

We are so sensitive to people's personal tastes that we are sometimes able to ignore that there are other cultures where humans are very different.\nI don't mean by that, I mean there are things I can do to avoid vegetarianism.

It offers an inside look at the magic of friendship and their journey of friendship. A lot of teens find those books interesting, but the author goes way beyond the book to show teens how much one learns from friendship, and how one might find out how much one knows about their friendship and how much they need each other.\n\nSome of the fun is revealed in the book\u2019s text. The book begins with one particular conversation in which one guy reveals his deep relationship to his friend to another guy. Another one is in his bedroom with his girlfriend \u2014 and again, with their secret. In the second one, they discuss friendship, but even in the first one is the secret that is in them both.\n\nAnother really fun and touching part about the book is also given in the book that shows the secret in each guy who finds a girl. A lot of teens want to be friends but in real life you don\u2019t really have any friends. A group of teens find a circle that leads them to a friendship where they both find others. Another surprise is an article about how friendships can change. Here the author talks about friendship and writing books.","token_len":289,"entropy":[7.1549,0.3239,6.7248,8.6446,1.9972,6.212,2.3245,4.9013,3.7539,0.3654,0.2761,11.238,1.9771,6.6479,0.1699,1.1658,1.6884,0.6747,1.9532,4.1735,5.4129,0.7665,2.5221,15.624,4.5469,0.753,1.5102,0.0018,2.2599,5.5789,1.705,2.1034,3.6671,0.0145,5.8284,3.3429,1.9007,4.3432,0.2284,1.2281,4.5419,0.7286,4.5969,0.0972,4.2458,4.2233,0.7386,1.7905,0.0045,3.1955,4.5291,4.4998,6.1996,0.3987,3.0373,5.8438,2.5013,5.0025,0.0805,0.3769,0.8721,5.9527,0.4534,6.4652,1.3797,6.1991,2.585,4.8618,2.6404,0.8245,4.7011,3.8828,0.1909,7.5459,2.4148,6.526,1.437,3.2514,1.1742,1.3568,2.9444,4.2919,4.7857,5.3075,0.1694,2.2646,3.1553,2.1022,2.7289,4.6647,0.7631,2.9388,6.6132,3.6419,0.9806,4.9975,2.2882,1.3332,0.671,4.5696,4.5451,3.6352,3.1381,3.2827,1.1899,2.7633,3.8724,1.1422,3.657,2.5365,2.8016,1.8363,1.6693,1.5159,4.0643,3.2446,0.0373,0.5713,0.4522,0.0002,5.4938,0.6675,0.1793,5.0266,2.3007,5.4511,0.9416,0.7706,1.8996,13.8776,6.9835,6.452,6.9539,2.0255,2.0699,2.6479,4.2277,0.4664,4.5299,7.3661,3.8592,2.9976,1.1472,2.1545,6.3499,5.7465,1.7534,5.429,4.8321,1.8438,1.9648,2.2961,5.5656,6.5146,1.5526,1.1046,4.1995,3.3303,3.185,4.3199,4.2906,4.2123,2.8622,1.4738,2.6152,7.2351,2.2612,5.732,0.8403,4.545,3.8439,5.7034,1.7312,3.8747,1.2999,3.6068,1.9147,0.2122,2.6061,3.3417,5.3665,1.6265,2.0175,5.1369,3.0615,1.4617,2.2973,0.8453,6.0071,4.9683,4.2364,2.6005,2.6173,5.0222,4.7422,4.0688,0.6114,1.2739,0.0002,4.1588,6.3317,1.0204,4.3426,3.5794,3.0028,3.5927,1.3032,0.1584,0.2001,6.3385,5.5157,0.7778,0.2852,1.8215,5.0481,3.6356,1.8121,4.7011,4.2723,3.3395,4.499,5.5516,4.4316,2.7205,6.5745,1.317,3.6656,2.6221,0.0364,1.8325,4.265,0.2251,2.1786,0.8404,3.8582,4.1709,5.8772,0.0063,5.6545,1.697,11.2526,1.7804,0.1019,3.3101,2.2262,2.2663,1.0708,0.8545,3.7916,3.6645,0.0967,0.6822,1.5786,0.5813,9.2056,2.8643,2.5111,0.4353,0.159,2.5599,2.6339,3.4186,0.907,4.8102,1.8567,5.4422,1.8522,4.5352,5.7519,0.8278,4.8599,4.5056,1.777,2.1952,4.6178,1.8051,2.3983,2.6055,6.1454,2.838,2.1941,2.4953,0.1172,3.5936,1.7599,7.1224,6.2962,1.7489]}

To their horror they discover our biological history as pursuit predators\u2014unstoppable, regenerating and incredibly cunning creatures from their nightmares.\n\nThe book is intended to bring humanity into existence in a much more comprehensive sense, focusing mainly on species that have not yet become a reality. This section explores the human, animal, and marine populations of North America, specifically the North Atlantic and Pacific oceans; the southern American continent and the southern Indian American coastal state. It then goes on to define the human and marine ecosystems of the USA and the British Columbia region and how they have transformed over time.\n\nThroughout the book we experience an enormous amount of the natural histories of human life. From the time that the ocean was found in the North Atlantic as early as the mid-1800s onwards, to the time that the Great Atlantic was discovered, we are often referred to by our race as \"the first human beings\". Even in the first few centuries the term \"Humanity\" was lost to most historians. The last few centuries are known as the \"first human years\".\n\nWhat the authors describe is an extraordinary, yet unassuming series of books, all about the history of human life and the ways the human race have evolved over time.\n\nThis book is a major historical resource for history and anthropology in which we can all learn from their experiences.","token_len":290,"entropy":[7.4121,2.5141,2.7739,5.6479,2.6729,2.1855,4.5593,1.7274,8.7959,0.8864,3.205,11.1559,1.0089,5.4543,2.1227,6.5644,1.8131,5.4193,6.0104,5.3949,3.531,5.7306,6.6036,8.0021,5.1723,3.0594,14.3218,9.7301,5.0092,5.8771,6.6246,0.0814,1.5438,8.9666,0.7266,2.6996,8.0924,5.7627,3.9858,5.8678,4.3053,9.4339,0.5745,2.0088,0.0029,2.3302,6.0878,1.4936,5.4788,0.6666,4.3635,3.56,2.4989,6.6335,2.3549,1.0486,5.1718,0.728,5.6488,2.7047,1.5995,5.0972,5.3251,0.0321,5.3092,2.5486,1.3577,3.3637,0.7082,4.1895,3.8433,2.6268,0.6987,3.0054,5.9906,3.8801,1.0253,3.8608,4.8943,2.0546,0.8096,0.5195,6.9022,4.2329,1.0146,4.1149,0.149,0.6588,5.5265,1.1444,3.323,2.2834,1.6265,1.8025,1.0305,4.8014,1.4187,5.0925,5.0724,2.6997,2.4837,0.7878,3.5472,3.0123,7.3175,7.4289,6.9669,2.2902,2.1668,3.9972,3.2445,0.6579,0.0232,5.7677,0.9128,2.8683,2.8554,0.6735,2.6606,1.6937,0.7934,6.5819,1.4163,1.6128,5.7875,2.237,3.0093,2.8102,3.5619,1.2023,2.0672,5.016,1.4588,1.5032,0.6138,0.8611,0.0002,5.7906,0.7691,0.2056,2.3226,7.1664,3.2054,4.4184,1.3268,0.0081,4.5949,3.4781,7.1893,0.5825,3.8132,2.5159,1.4688,3.1041,1.0866,4.474,2.9305,2.5437,6.7595,1.3252,6.5075,1.3492,0.8869,5.726,0.7972,6.0141,1.0897,0.0047,1.9282,3.2204,0.4481,1.0755,0.2068,5.9321,0.6186,2.1293,0.2564,1.6142,0.6542,1.357,4.0274,5.3425,5.9901,0.5686,3.309,2.5986,1.8594,4.8486,4.3395,0.0154,3.2454,1.9809,6.3395,0.4651,1.2486,1.6638,4.0811,2.5311,1.3123,1.7663,5.4939,2.7985,0.8786,4.2773,1.6926,1.8008,5.0873,4.5878,0.529,4.4868,1.0958,0.0887,1.6388,6.7696,1.621,5.063,3.4247,0.9864,2.3606,4.9743,2.1571,1.1616,2.7138,4.4004,1.231,0.5466,1.6379,4.6573,1.8297,4.3539,1.2378,0.8174,0.0002,4.3715,4.2382,3.628,4.113,1.7534,2.1857,3.5815,3.9685,4.28,4.6327,4.1111,4.6078,0.153,4.4844,2.0007,3.2651,2.7727,1.1656,3.2832,0.2359,1.6144,1.7198,2.2202,1.3828,4.5015,4.1597,1.0106,0.7725,4.7937,1.9306,0.68,0.6918,0.2503,2.1357,0.0002,3.341,1.3071,0.8591,1.8995,5.0743,4.9722,3.4295,0.5826,5.5433,3.2281,2.8599,2.4976,5.8617,1.8144,1.6702,5.6945,1.7099,1.6516,5.1175,3.0343,1.1999]}

You can avoid that with fiction in that order. It's really a good thing to not read any of it because you may find that you do a nice job of hiding the bad or misleading stuff.\n\nWhen you're done, you can go and read a book you enjoy as well as one you find so boring that you forget the title.

They all are fun characters and I'm good with a few that are just super-creepy\/funny\/sore. I love being on top of things and can tell someone is trying not to be. And I don't feel like they'd be good in the movies either.\nI have seen a shit ton of superheroes. Marvel and DC have plenty of good ones...\nI'm aware. But I think the superhero movie takes on a superhero\/superhero image that has very little to do with superhero movies.  If not superheroes, then super-heals, etc...\nNo need to explain super-heals. I've seen a few people that are super-heals or super-trendy that I can sort of understand.   However, I personally think they don't need to be super-heals or super-trendy because there are so many other great superhero films, some even great but some movies where you see them, but still have nothing to support it.\nI just enjoy them, I think it's what makes them good.

{"id":2553,"ended":true,"length":279,"text":"A notorious serial killer is about to torture and mutilate his next victim in a randomly chosen abandoned house. As the killer approaches the victim, something happens that makes them realize that there's someone, or something, else that is more evil with them.\n\nThe book is a collection of 25 books, most of them written by an expert, including David O. Sussman, a professor of psychology at Cornell University. As the killer is nearing the \"foul end\" of his life, this book will tell the story of not only the suspect, but the victims who survived. The next chapter in the series is \"The Darkest Hour.\"\n\nIf you are new to the comic book world, you may not know who is who. There are many ways you can read comics from the late 1990s onwards in a safe and professional fashion. The book is divided into four sections: 'Introduction to Comics - Chapter 1, 'Character' and 'Character '. The first part of the book focuses on the character's main life. Then the rest is about his personal life. At this point, the reader may have a more personal view. The second part of the book deals with the character's relationship with his parents, or life after his mother died, all whilst simultaneously covering the real crime and the killer. The third part of the book deals with his death and the ending. The final section deals with his life after his parents died.","token_len":292,"entropy":[11.4592,5.3919,0.2319,2.8656,5.2865,0.0346,9.1327,1.8604,4.633,0.0094,0.0005,1.9678,8.0777,0.4239,2.9303,1.0819,11.5407,1.7648,9.101,2.823,0.8883,4.2357,1.5579,3.5786,4.5985,1.0661,3.4553,0.6987,6.9142,2.5425,1.6646,2.5207,4.4279,3.6775,1.1587,3.2316,1.4845,4.5222,5.1404,3.5807,0.914,1.2414,3.5306,2.7321,2.4797,4.4269,3.9969,6.6854,1.1884,0.6478,2.0196,0.0034,2.1583,4.4224,1.4298,1.8742,4.3828,0.0171,6.4351,3.2238,1.8213,4.4622,0.1985,0.9404,2.7886,0.6271,4.9714,5.3046,3.0421,2.7944,5.4617,4.9607,0.2915,6.214,5.7771,0.0621,0.9474,2.3366,2.3585,0.4342,1.4676,0.333,4.5807,0.1618,0.9971,5.2917,2.1777,5.1109,3.3711,4.7053,0.888,7.5201,5.7272,5.6507,1.8589,0.7388,0.1677,0.5244,3.423,0.187,5.1056,1.6411,2.6284,3.8489,1.1726,0.573,0.09,6.7705,0.4858,1.1943,7.0494,0.7923,0.1561,1.4824,3.5378,3.0778,3.968,1.1721,2.3521,6.0909,2.7771,2.586,0.4852,0.5628,2.192,2.5089,1.276,4.6033,3.905,2.5817,1.7359,0.5638,0.0002,4.878,0.2245,2.6481,3.2624,0.0759,1.4871,5.1915,0.8878,1.2112,0.2939,1.5538,1.231,3.3363,1.446,3.3898,3.1299,4.8167,1.4093,3.6105,0.5096,2.07,4.8171,2.3956,0.1456,2.3801,4.4058,3.777,1.3132,5.6941,2.9802,0.1105,5.4009,4.7477,2.4495,4.8673,1.2571,4.666,4.634,0.5002,2.446,3.4826,1.2571,3.7228,0.0575,2.1396,2.0159,1.3102,6.1273,6.2685,2.3662,2.2529,5.6818,5.7151,0.9941,3.554,1.3075,5.4441,4.0777,0.5522,0.1076,3.2511,10.3213,1.6838,0.905,2.7313,1.1892,0.4096,1.0319,3.6023,0.0517,0.7103,2.9222,2.5474,5.3829,5.2044,2.2491,4.2647,1.719,3.7083,2.5547,1.5739,1.3205,3.8854,0.2511,1.4123,4.7849,2.3397,0.1602,0.724,1.0832,1.4069,3.6104,3.1102,2.4961,4.7133,3.373,1.3754,3.1639,1.9293,1.8647,0.2795,0.7317,0.0299,0.2019,2.5798,0.0569,1.0538,2.3025,0.1382,2.3342,0.2202,0.9658,3.0269,1.6966,4.7883,6.8422,3.7548,2.1969,3.0374,1.6455,2.851,6.716,7.2385,5.0967,4.6096,1.0353,5.3132,5.8424,3.1412,1.1008,5.5124,1.9851,1.2706,0.2424,0.2586,1.1624,0.0148,0.121,1.4853,0.027,1.3632,4.945,1.6389,1.3429,4.9659,1.5987,1.7322,1.3139,2.4022,1.8284,0.0229,1.0861,2.9117,0.7172,0.6933,2.4608,1.7731,0.6497]}

The game is almost identical to a third person shooter out there and I think that is one of the reasons it is not working for me for many of the other games out there.","token_len":294,"entropy":[7.6723,3.7969,1.6503,11.2354,6.5565,0.9152,5.8574,10.1786,7.5321,3.4165,0.6317,2.4694,3.9315,3.5212,5.8427,2.7321,7.2067,1.3677,5.1961,8.2495,5.1561,6.0013,2.8226,4.181,2.6726,2.3394,2.9688,1.5307,3.3251,5.0408,2.5105,5.1563,4.3618,2.4332,4.9418,2.7044,1.1484,2.1878,0.7773,6.7269,5.4185,3.6245,4.5111,5.7426,2.2437,6.0373,6.9544,3.9706,1.7347,6.0577,6.0602,3.7628,4.7044,4.5753,6.5981,6.203,4.843,2.0465,4.0294,0.1973,2.4203,2.5626,5.4932,8.3005,0.4562,0.2826,5.5705,3.8076,5.267,0.0006,1.1965,1.8939,0.2447,0.2379,1.0056,2.6771,1.172,3.4959,5.5155,0.1305,3.8751,1.8669,0.258,0.3269,1.929,4.5539,0.5285,3.8873,3.13,1.3914,2.5042,2.3062,4.1663,2.5123,4.7164,0.3177,0.1809,5.8009,1.8885,3.9391,1.5159,0.905,1.4536,0.5866,0.0489,0.6987,2.9519,9.5294,5.9005,0.2013,0.1378,0.0657,0.1384,0.0071,0.0011,0.0015,2.1943,0.0144,0.0028,0.0052,0.0142,0.0367,0.0046,0.0172,0.0404,1.3681,3.9099,5.9882,7.0045,2.0033,3.5357,3.2609,1.3485,4.7024,1.8402,1.3272,4.1544,2.0645,4.1621,4.3688,3.9343,5.0756,2.7723,1.7095,6.6181,1.2605,2.7343,3.8118,1.3427,1.0679,5.3132,0.5475,4.7319,2.9853,3.4817,0.2962,4.3777,0.6756,1.9835,3.3045,4.1775,3.003,1.8347,2.6396,1.8214,3.7644,1.2793,2.465,3.0209,1.6292,5.8364,2.9894,4.6628,4.6915,0.0222,4.7752,1.359,1.8641,2.5113,1.6617,0.8875,5.1775,5.0446,3.7981,0.9265,4.617,2.3995,5.1146,1.4968,2.2303,2.6651,2.6983,3.605,2.7007,0.4095,0.9871,6.9213,9.3044,2.4842,2.2652,3.5343,5.5478,3.3832,2.9196,5.088,1.4866,1.5167,2.4633,2.4876,1.407,4.3276,5.4118,6.0343,2.6874,1.199,1.1363,1.2699,4.6088,1.3056,2.9604,0.0007,0.789,0.1053,4.9103,1.1987,5.5845,5.8721,2.0489,2.0287,6.4164,3.0921,5.5329,0.943,1.3549,1.556,5.8984,1.7863,2.4094,3.8559,1.2464,1.4795,4.0431,1.244,2.1395,6.3829,1.752,1.9616,2.4296,0.0333,4.4986,2.9649,1.5269,3.7935,1.3881,1.8222,0.6948,0.7893,4.5066,2.2348,2.1545,5.6572,4.5273,0.3472,2.6485,5.2255,1.1203,0.7724,7.4442,0.6214,3.8819,1.6691,3.4014,1.6962,2.6303,3.6781,0.4029,0.1303,1.3726,2.9014,1.1508,2.9794,6.7203,2.0231,0.2724,5.5996,4.0003,1.666,0.7848,3.6494,0.7085,2.2358,0.0051,0.2]}

{"id":239,"ended":false,"length":261,"text":"A minor character : small-town failed politician, who was never elected to office, comes to terms with the failure of his ambitions during his small-town retirement, and how he is determined to improve it.\nBobby Larkin who is best-known for his portrayal of Henry Larkin, has written an article on Larkin, the character from 'The Man Who Sold the City'.  It describes Larkin as a man who has not lost the ambition to improve lives for himself and other individuals, though he knows this is far from how he wishes to be remembered, and how he feels.  The first chapter gives a better description of the protagonist, but then the second chapter takes on Larkin himself.  The last chapter has a wider meaning for him as he attempts to bring down people he sees as corrupt in his small town, but this is hardly the climax to the whole scene.  This is certainly a more realistic version of 'The Man Who Sold the City'.  The most enjoyable aspect of 'The Man Who Sold the City' is the moment when he realizes what life was like before he took his place.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Larkin and John O'Brien: Life in a Small Town, History and Entertainment (2002)\n Larkin & John O'Brien: Life in a Small Town, History and Entertainment (1994)\n John O'Brien: Life in a Small Town, History and Entertainment (1996)","token_len":295,"entropy":[9.193,5.8009,8.6227,7.9108,3.8389,3.9587,11.9805,6.7949,1.9768,3.4864,2.6459,4.774,1.3759,1.3101,1.2241,1.6021,7.8304,1.529,5.6701,0.059,1.8207,4.3715,0.2206,1.018,7.1535,6.1527,1.5253,7.5704,0.625,0.0159,8.8249,2.1034,1.344,6.7655,0.8547,2.8767,5.0256,0.1068,5.1608,4.8697,0.8209,1.4109,8.7159,4.2168,6.0333,3.4096,6.8143,1.7504,6.1624,4.3997,0.0488,0.4984,0.5729,3.8647,0.116,5.8666,5.2819,0.0873,2.2387,3.7283,4.2592,3.734,3.9433,2.0245,3.1993,0.0073,2.3479,3.9027,3.4923,3.6237,5.4057,1.3589,4.4822,0.9915,3.5569,1.2204,4.5708,1.7031,6.4205,9.756,4.2945,1.7372,0.0005,0.2802,1.0627,2.8673,0.7542,2.4149,4.8427,4.6383,2.9818,5.3825,1.1173,3.9104,6.017,1.9542,3.5031,0.9915,3.6906,4.784,1.3197,5.4896,0.8076,5.3371,3.7425,1.7932,5.223,0.0848,5.6783,0.7568,3.5381,0.4663,2.5324,1.4789,2.4497,0.9521,3.2246,0.6544,2.8131,4.5673,1.2512,2.7092,5.278,3.1431,5.7495,1.4919,4.9026,1.9782,0.1707,1.9449,5.2807,1.2173,2.6009,4.2324,2.5406,2.4128,0.184,3.8437,2.6005,4.7627,0.0042,4.9986,1.1688,0.8761,2.0322,4.7937,0.3512,3.7582,1.725,7.1775,5.0636,2.1584,2.4694,2.6479,1.4152,4.9198,0.0385,5.0033,3.4115,6.2741,2.964,3.5039,0.1399,2.5781,4.2087,1.1762,6.964,0.8979,1.1745,1.9936,3.8735,1.0732,5.7413,1.3906,6.9632,2.0715,0.8252,4.2745,6.2771,0.3761,1.1372,3.0516,1.0687,5.3751,1.6601,3.6377,3.342,3.5629,0.0625,5.3719,0.8682,0.3491,0.0735,0.0155,0.0878,0.0155,1.5111,1.2983,2.1961,5.5087,6.4597,3.1431,0.2223,2.8475,0.1042,0.0342,0.0073,0.001,0.0815,0.0196,0.0621,0.147,0.9755,6.3615,1.1485,2.4881,3.3579,2.7274,5.7922,2.3182,0.1782,2.5951,0.6497,4.2187,2.8003,2.6898,1.7938,2.0921,7.6005,6.3754,1.4169,0.0004,5.3109,1.0984,4.6333,17.77,0.0658,3.7392,5.0492,5.2986,0.4527,2.0269,3.1099,5.7904,1.682,1.9644,1.6338,0.2581,1.4518,7.5767,2.3123,7.3723,3.8792,4.6497,0.8089,1.491,16.0164,0.0182,4.1623,1.9582,0.2143,0.0024,0.0037,0.9816,0.8884,0.0557,0.0228,0.0789,0.0048,0.3541,0.2787,0.0307,0.0089,0.4076,5.5164,0.0865,0.7659,17.9724,0.3716,0.0052,0.0432,0.6847,1.8827,0.0576,0.0171,0.0545,0.0036,0.3211,0.2191,0.0178,0.0106,0.0812,2.4181,0.0103]}

Not sure a movie can be \"fun\" without being pretty bad, but if they made a movie about aliens in a bad, human world, that would be awesome.  Like they can be bad people and be horrible people, but not bad people. And bad people will love them.   Or maybe some movies make sense to make sense and be good if they are bad, and some makes sense not so good...\nIt isn't just about science and technology if you like aliens. If the plot of The Martian has any chance at a good world building.  If not then it really won't make sense at all and it's a bad movie.  I thought a movie about race would make sense though but I don't think it will be too good.\nLets just say this is a bad film and I love it. That said, I dont think an alien movie should have a long runtime. If you watch or love movies about race then you don't hate it. You hate it for how the human race reacts to the events in the Martian where everything is evil, bad, scary, and depressing. I mean... The main character has a very small role and it just feels like the worst movie to ever be made.

The issue is with the quality of life of the addicts (i.e. the quality of sex, education, and the quality of education as well). If not treated correctly then its not a problem at all and its a shame that we can't really treat a problem that much better.\nI'd be happy to work on an initiative that would provide that sort of service to our addicts.  However, I personally think abstinence training should be mandatory for all healthcare providers that hire non-medical professionals.\nI agree, and I support it - it would be great to have the training and tools to help our addicts have better outcomes than just smoking.

If you mean fans who have never played the books, or who haven't experienced the show and therefore care about the books, I would recommend starting with the books but also starting with the other books.","token_len":296,"entropy":[10.026,4.5468,7.3766,1.572,3.1129,11.1944,1.2732,7.3671,0.1111,1.2669,2.1745,3.5083,6.3119,6.1987,1.7444,1.9639,6.6259,6.3099,4.9188,7.6511,1.5317,5.4444,2.9201,4.9429,5.588,1.9069,1.2535,1.1916,12.1719,0.3393,2.4897,0.563,4.0811,2.0269,1.9351,5.7992,5.9259,6.2572,7.1034,1.9226,1.1791,3.7066,1.227,2.5194,0.0753,4.9808,1.5354,0.1515,2.5683,1.5697,4.4427,0.8505,1.3305,0.1204,4.769,1.2883,4.4477,3.1526,3.3545,4.8575,3.0799,0.4808,0.5273,7.1183,1.8874,5.1611,0.6172,2.1565,0.3069,1.033,5.8844,4.4437,1.2153,1.9848,5.1853,1.9438,1.5966,2.2807,2.2227,1.3259,1.659,2.3118,3.3395,3.2558,3.2745,3.8773,1.8905,0.1491,3.5533,2.0857,3.8806,4.51,5.5828,0.9762,4.6123,1.1131,0.5957,3.7287,3.3744,2.1998,1.6557,0.576,1.0498,4.1225,5.2605,4.1583,6.8472,0.8188,0.9603,3.9565,2.907,1.2659,1.0722,1.227,4.3219,4.0234,4.7584,2.8514,1.8748,4.5567,3.8113,3.9493,0.0898,1.5518,2.3411,4.2185,2.6729,6.7639,2.8161,2.9298,2.2804,1.3971,2.6867,5.4712,3.0311,0.7617,6.5919,4.5923,1.1077,0.4985,6.2091,11.0283,2.5105,0.6905,2.7201,4.6035,1.0888,0.8427,3.2715,2.4427,0.9311,3.1821,2.9716,1.3236,1.8098,0.7074,4.1239,1.517,1.3556,1.0085,1.5454,2.2139,3.682,5.7943,6.4747,0.8177,1.1661,0.907,2.3791,0.1767,1.4446,4.0688,0.8776,2.0518,5.5591,5.6884,1.123,2.4438,2.3409,2.5695,3.3236,2.1807,3.1723,1.0997,0.5259,0.9559,2.6316,4.2417,5.7836,5.3315,0.3208,1.7493,6.3629,1.8769,2.4958,1.9372,1.2443,1.505,2.5312,2.9604,4.1072,4.4982,1.4845,3.8584,0.1039,2.0734,1.3211,3.1586,1.3,2.0171,1.1267,4.6626,3.4964,1.2277,0.8933,1.9342,2.9845,0.8309,0.7858,3.1345,0.8543,3.1731,3.7154,5.0278,0.5175,3.789,4.5806,0.2838,4.2098,4.3762,0.5672,2.9914,1.2737,1.1003,1.8757,2.2259,0.0008,0.8992,1.3582,5.3553,6.2895,6.5228,4.7417,10.1342,0.8858,3.6978,4.6008,2.2415,0.399,1.3245,0.8094,2.9217,0.3571,6.2603,1.7047,2.6517,0.6547,5.4366,1.8917,0.8141,2.3239,1.7841,5.8405,0.6629,0.8106,1.2652,2.3869,2.095,2.2639,0.0007,5.6264,0.9091,3.2702,3.1217,6.1233,6.3044,0.9604,0.8902,2.9476,0.8687,2.7614,2.7829,4.0012,5.6462,0.9171,0.6303,2.591,4.9188,3.9344,3.7055,0.347,0.852,4.4782,1.3312,0.8197]}

{"id":4320,"ended":true,"length":289,"text":"The Machines have finally taken over. When scanning retinas for memories to see what humans are worth keeping alive, they come across someone that works in IT.\n\nThe Machines are working together to create machines that will allow them to scan and interpret, and to use facial recognition, data gathered by human models, to make intelligent decisions, and to make decisions based on those decisions. The Machines can be used to make decisions based on the information we gather on the machines; for example, if we see a machine that knows where water comes from, it can interpret that information to make better health decisions.\n\nThe Machines can also play a key role in the science of self-driving cars. The machines that use human brain chemistry in certain applications allow us to understand who we are as humans. They can be powerful to be used on a car with a software engine, and to enable a human to make decisions based on that information, like determining when or how the water is going to come in. At the same time, they may play a key role in finding the right genes that make life that much better.\n\nThe Machines can also play a huge role in the science of autonomous vehicles that can be built and deployed globally, such as autonomous cars that support social networks. For instance, in the United States, Amazon will use robots to make cars. These robots can make decisions based on how much power they have, and how quickly they can return those power to people when necessary.","token_len":298,"entropy":[12.1508,5.005,6.3979,4.3821,2.127,1.979,5.4314,9.9775,9.7891,1.8428,4.7151,7.1064,6.4343,5.1918,3.153,8.171,1.3462,9.1778,8.1375,3.5471,0.3972,1.2436,5.0588,1.5797,7.0487,3.5691,6.6773,2.124,7.0599,0.8092,2.3247,0.0019,2.3053,1.6684,1.6258,4.8576,3.953,0.7293,2.3119,3.8926,0.697,2.205,3.905,1.8612,0.0372,4.7396,2.5548,4.639,5.5123,2.1068,2.8095,4.407,7.1768,0.3968,3.6487,5.9375,3.9317,1.3509,2.9887,7.0615,1.4995,0.586,2.7528,4.3441,0.6558,3.1846,1.727,1.0636,2.7133,1.6586,1.7969,0.0556,4.2244,2.1182,0.1723,2.337,0.9941,2.9966,3.0347,1.9972,0.5002,2.5953,1.5351,1.3412,0.0505,2.0891,2.1883,4.2643,2.6415,3.9952,1.2499,1.5469,4.6988,3.0877,0.2302,0.0773,1.9176,1.7451,3.7653,1.3493,4.7544,1.6701,4.5935,3.1291,8.5781,3.5926,0.0237,0.5301,1.2565,1.0276,4.8859,1.1036,1.0263,1.7838,1.811,3.4588,8.3809,0.3154,0.5718,0.8307,0.0002,1.5382,0.4915,1.9917,0.9183,5.3704,0.7134,2.8664,0.0514,0.1011,2.0882,6.1276,0.3279,5.1348,0.0739,0.5179,0.074,0.8285,1.737,1.382,3.0444,3.6688,3.8081,3.9471,6.5085,4.5771,5.54,4.1981,6.5377,2.642,0.034,3.3267,5.764,1.2275,0.1528,3.0743,1.8607,1.4426,2.7343,0.6909,2.8047,7.4504,4.8977,4.9371,0.5066,3.3342,1.8508,3.4394,3.9795,1.6924,5.8464,3.4391,1.5683,1.9217,2.602,5.0498,2.789,2.7467,0.8354,3.2676,1.354,0.7388,0.037,2.2847,1.0474,2.4969,4.3664,5.4359,2.5887,3.209,1.6365,3.5505,3.7475,1.8529,1.6493,0.0297,1.7492,3.6789,0.7107,6.1089,0.6327,0.2958,0.0024,0.0632,1.1916,4.3541,5.566,0.2591,1.5858,0.0695,0.0628,5.9162,2.5269,2.6467,5.3947,2.888,2.604,5.7225,6.3305,1.4658,1.8427,1.1959,0.4752,0.0002,1.5418,0.6071,2.0771,0.6847,2.6086,0.0804,5.9657,0.187,0.0359,1.5383,2.4239,0.0233,3.7676,1.1612,4.0702,1.8829,1.8699,2.9485,2.2673,3.968,5.801,1.781,3.4357,0.0085,1.6441,2.5579,0.818,7.6773,5.0716,1.651,1.7083,4.1093,2.4472,0.0054,3.4033,1.3461,2.4276,0.0705,0.2003,6.1906,4.2084,2.8175,2.6528,0.343,3.193,4.2581,3.3716,3.3596,0.9775,1.9918,3.1949,2.8787,0.4244,0.0281,3.0105,2.4403,4.5485,0.5882,1.0833,1.1796,1.1645,1.3025,1.7331,0.5538,0.7318,6.0018,4.7336,1.288,1.0416,4.743,3.0966,4.7576,0.1784]}

Not sure a glass can be an effective, yet clean water is the main source of energy.\nIt is also quite hard to clean from the well since the water still gets cold and the tap water is dirty, so the solution is not easy. But the solution is to clean water by using clean tap water instead of water.\nThis is one of the ways to clean the water from the well. That means you should clean only two things.\nFirst of all if you clean all of the water that you pour from your well and only a little bit as much as you pour from your tap water then you can see that the water is contaminated. If we say that the whole water from your tap water is contaminated then we should say that the whole water is polluted and that is why in the end you use dirty tap water.\nSecondly clean water should be filtered and purified and we can then start with clean taps.\nThis solution has been proposed only for use in some industries. But in general you should expect that the water from your tap water is contaminated.\nIf you want clean tap water then you should clean as well.\nIn addition to this, you should keep in mind that you should use the tap water to clean your well. This solution of cleaning your tap water is a fantastic solution.","token_len":300,"entropy":[3.1393,9.5076,5.7978,7.3777,1.1808,5.4905,4.5147,0.9949,3.1522,2.5108,6.574,10.1098,4.86,0.592,2.2222,0.131,9.0826,9.1369,8.0981,1.6619,3.9719,3.9472,7.893,8.9002,0.7114,6.2841,1.7928,0.0534,5.555,2.5077,2.5822,4.9257,1.7344,0.0327,2.0596,1.9142,5.6557,6.8676,7.2624,3.4146,2.8692,2.4895,4.9627,3.0426,4.8846,5.1597,4.0804,3.6139,7.7062,2.0239,1.8226,0.4917,0.0362,0.1705,0.1816,2.09,16.6893,1.247,3.3747,4.9306,4.1402,0.17,3.4551,5.9993,1.3071,6.3969,7.1792,1.6917,1.0852,5.6859,3.2091,5.0515,1.4247,2.8079,5.9345,0.9708,1.2615,3.9812,2.9663,1.8969,2.5448,4.0838,0.5524,2.9449,3.5633,1.1766,3.3298,2.7919,2.326,0.4702,3.1333,2.5781,3.0287,3.1714,2.4024,3.727,3.2653,0.0605,4.3041,0.2529,2.3052,4.6953,0.7798,13.6193,1.2002,3.905,0.3857,0.2164,4.7429,1.6982,2.3386,1.4682,0.6001,2.792,0.5983,0.4691,0.835,5.5999,2.6724,2.6716,3.8303,2.9834,5.5,6.4262,2.8992,2.1584,1.5658,13.308,2.6164,0.0027,5.2979,0.3293,3.7341,3.6287,2.1356,0.2131,0.6508,3.1726,1.7741,3.1932,2.7814,2.508,0.4811,2.8132,4.568,4.2404,2.3989,0.9252,6.3116,1.453,1.8063,0.7608,1.5602,0.6984,1.4498,2.0009,0.8184,1.8817,0.6224,1.5789,3.3347,1.3278,1.2988,0.398,0.8349,5.5282,0.8198,2.9693,5.0118,4.4181,0.7977,1.787,5.3588,1.1048,4.1194,1.4905,2.9899,1.0064,0.7184,0.4528,0.7342,1.4916,3.2092,1.0338,0.1959,1.1021,1.2518,0.2458,1.5837,3.7533,2.4715,1.2181,2.1597,1.7628,5.3341,1.3964,2.6926,2.1194,6.3464,4.0692,0.6482,0.017,0.7185,0.5341,10.0401,3.1576,0.9793,3.4111,0.7206,3.7049,2.1256,4.313,3.1748,5.1712,1.9573,3.5567,4.058,4.4038,2.4364,4.1871,0.9699,1.2995,9.0187,5.7143,3.4439,1.507,4.8969,6.8155,1.8835,5.3718,0.6045,3.5837,5.2664,1.5683,1.8328,2.8659,2.7616,3.0846,1.1384,6.7832,1.9493,1.8705,1.4875,1.627,1.087,1.8248,0.4775,1.3882,2.3016,1.4662,1.0306,6.568,0.4813,2.9694,3.4424,2.6585,0.0335,1.0449,0.651,1.0001,2.7474,5.2666,2.1885,2.3818,1.4768,3.6959,3.8595,0.9749,2.4446,1.321,1.1766,0.4073,4.4747,2.1178,0.0305,0.22,2.2329,1.4002,3.0387,2.5232,4.5381,0.1063,2.8315,1.2744,1.9592,2.6033,1.1738,3.2416,5.1825,4.9706,2.3424,2.8822,3.2504,0.1332,1.1527,2.7507,6.7958,1.662,1.5921]}

The next mission to Mars has arrived, and while a few have appeared on Earth, including one from NASA, only one of those were human-made.\n\nThe Curiosity rover had lost power for about a week. And after a brief, one-week-long power outage, the vehicle finally came into service today, thanks to the help of some NASA engineers. That means that the rover has started to reach its full power.\n\nIn addition to helping the rover reach its full power, it was also useful to have its propulsion system work as well. The first one was an electrical charge, a chemical that acts as a brake valve to the rover's wheels.\n\nThat worked quite well in order for the rover to avoid burning fuel in the final two weeks of its journey.\n\nThe agency's second manned mission to Mars is scheduled to fly today with a mission from the U.S. Mars rover Curiosity. Both missions will launch at 7:10 a.m. EDT, as described earlier.\n\nThe Curiosity mission is the first manned flight for Mars in nearly two decades.

And the company is hoping sales will grow in 2016.\n\nIt also has an outlook for 2014 that it says shows signs of improvement.\n\nOn Friday its shares were trading up 23 per cent after a strong start.","token_len":301,"entropy":[3.0338,4.8965,2.1422,3.3203,2.5835,5.1579,2.0505,8.8848,6.5107,3.8003,8.394,10.3351,4.5773,1.7505,5.8758,0.8181,5.1396,0.6077,9.6197,1.5797,6.351,2.4773,4.7526,8.2819,1.8511,3.4774,5.0966,1.5922,1.0303,0.0043,2.9298,6.092,1.732,0.9446,1.5652,2.621,6.4203,2.0956,3.547,0.0801,0.396,6.3409,0.1454,5.319,5.2235,1.4274,0.8771,3.6246,5.5987,0.0726,3.7545,4.5032,4.8481,0.4771,1.5274,3.9345,0.0052,0.89,4.447,5.9281,4.4004,6.2762,0.219,1.3217,0.6237,1.6206,0.0002,1.6693,2.9105,10.5358,4.6391,10.2642,1.1693,5.1697,4.3525,0.0219,4.9375,1.2378,0.0003,5.5378,2.0525,0.7973,1.4198,0.5312,0.8228,5.382,4.6917,1.0652,3.6179,1.7172,0.5683,1.6731,1.0681,1.2906,0.9148,1.5029,5.6523,1.9454,2.8503,5.2407,5.193,0.2056,0.9979,1.1536,0.0003,2.2117,6.4789,4.591,2.8022,3.2395,4.5956,3.4863,5.9267,0.0141,3.2117,2.5899,2.5653,4.6709,2.3354,2.2401,1.694,1.2771,3.3401,3.4998,0.1898,0.0049,5.0584,0.5699,3.6076,1.3704,6.3687,0.1995,0.4905,0.0002,4.7708,0.0257,6.7782,3.2558,0.6502,3.511,4.8477,0.0287,0.016,3.5888,7.7354,2.4028,5.2846,7.8847,0.2517,0.5506,2.424,1.0654,0.0002,5.0919,4.7599,2.6504,1.4963,3.5319,3.942,3.2585,1.1291,3.6846,1.5291,1.968,5.9356,1.7766,2.9792,3.6834,0.7353,0.9035,1.6232,0.172,4.9113,0.217,4.4817,1.0564,4.8364,2.6217,6.4247,4.104,0.0039,3.6738,3.7242,2.1714,6.5073,2.7912,2.465,2.7889,0.1393,5.1276,2.1958,3.9455,3.7971,3.0709,4.4134,3.1717,2.2872,3.4159,2.2398,2.5536,2.1652,0.8789,4.9476,2.4691,0.1035,0.1973,0.0672,0.0002,2.0224,3.7342,2.4608,4.0694,0.5327,7.2709,0.9828,3.3007,2.0779,2.9005,5.586,2.4152,1.7256,0.9266,1.0181,0.3943,0.0002,2.8799,7.5931,1.8855,0.8076,6.1349,2.1491,0.697,0.109,1.4659,0.0287,1.7791,7.3337,0.6319,0.5725,0.0002,4.0553,2.6804,3.242,6.1292,0.0002,0.9787,1.819,0.883,2.8976,0.1469,5.173,0.1603,4.9407,0.5671,1.069,2.3849,1.7015,1.0952,2.3531,5.4454,3.5377,1.2688,2.8145,3.1319,2.1927,1.2809,0.1559,0.0002,3.6015,2.3265,2.7786,3.5777,5.2385,0.4422,4.1836,1.1579,3.2148,1.6704,3.8895,4.3219,0.035,2.7264,0.4705,0.2802,0.0002,5.2684,2.9702,5.8835,2.2981,1.6684,2.9199,2.5129,5.2634,0.9416,0.0003,3.3627,2.2006,3.5016,1.1997,1.6735]}

Bush said the system was more advanced than previously discussed, but said the US military would need more funds to combat the threat posed by space radiation.","token_len":302,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.5578,1.8962,1.9547,6.6203,5.3118,2.7952,14.5152,0.1694,3.0187,0.9787,5.5552,2.725,1.0376,2.3229,0.001,1.8658,4.4449,3.293,1.6368,5.0322,6.0559,6.3082,0.152,3.7023,3.415,2.2029,5.2776,5.5543,0.498,1.4213,0.9171,0.0002,3.2764,1.1971,3.4929,2.7359,3.259,3.4047,0.3599,5.4537,2.0905,0.0076,1.9305,4.2328,1.9955,5.2933,1.2457,6.1275,0.0242,0.1683,0.0246,0.0207,0.0788,0.0001,0.1902,0.9887,0.889,3.6481,3.2802,5.8052,0.5935,7.8429,0.2833,2.0245,5.2741,4.9957,0.6797,2.0868,0.246,4.8936,6.237,6.7516,2.3631,9.8586,4.695,4.7342,2.4755,4.0274,5.7938,0.1235,7.5555,3.3313,1.3676,3.2158,0.3298,1.2645,0.1239,2.1525,5.8706,2.0553,2.3604,0.0097,2.7787,0.2435,4.0677,4.7502,1.641,3.3767,0.821,2.6394,5.5751,4.2912,1.44,0.0002,0.4978,1.4384,3.5973,1.4677,2.9926,3.353,0.4359,2.2302,0.0006,0.0015,0.0033,0.9879,0.0931,2.3421,0.2938,0.6699,0.0528,0.3582,0.3628,1.1769,0.1289,0.1365,0.1589,0.8176,0.0211,0.1034,0.0329,0.0051,0.014,0.0699,0.0202,0.1229,0.0032,0.0185,0.0024,0.0382,0.007,0.0084,0.0143,0.0012,0.0076,0.0014,4.3285,0.0039,0.0029,0.0014,0.005,0.0143,0.6999,3.7979,5.8485,0.001,0.0014,0.0023,3.4439,0.0069,2.4438,0.0045,0.8213,0.4335,0.0002,1.9359,3.0996,2.8954,4.7213,3.5479,4.4651,3.5981,0.6141,2.9599,1.5238,4.6915,0.1337,3.3584,3.488,0.9828,4.0785,5.03,5.5514,4.7921,1.926,2.174,0.0754,0.0002,3.013,0.0026,1.1651,0.607,5.4942,4.5533,0.8945,1.0797,7.0694,1.9389,3.3836,5.1609,3.4195,0.0087,1.5928,2.0154,1.414,7.7173,4.8848,1.1768,6.8149,1.7096,1.5782,5.8803,4.9543,1.7458,0.3603,0.0002,1.6574,2.3522,4.7154,0.043,4.1381,1.1727,3.5275,0.193,0.3011,1.6399,6.7927,0.0559,0.2062,0.6304,0.4933,1.0189,0.5945,2.161,4.3461,2.5176,4.9898,1.0111,1.4577,0.5667,1.05,6.8628,1.4845,4.6365,6.2718,6.1226,0.388,3.8888,4.8083,3.3656,0.2751,2.561,1.0285,1.9404,2.9376,3.2187,2.8717,2.503,0.1303,0.0002,5.6877,0.9391,2.1668,0.9324,3.4311,3.1456,0.1372,0.0022,0.0004,1.4408,0.9236,5.2361,1.359,4.5164,3.8387,0.1935,4.5227,7.395,1.355,1.3742,3.5629,1.579,4.7401,1.9192,2.2117,3.3054,2.4706,5.6538,0.545,4.4079,1.3831,0.955,2.7555,0.0387,1.1429,3.6079,0.4344]}

It is nothing more than being a lonely soul.","token_len":302,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,1.7331,5.7029,4.4391,1.5996,6.9471,1.6075,5.4009,1.2528,2.8322,1.0382,2.866,0.3903,1.1637,2.592,0.6933,2.1934,4.153,4.5409,2.8109,7.3394,0.2721,2.6671,1.8226,1.4002,6.4837,2.2105,4.656,2.4117,12.5976,0.0352,0.0898,2.6942,2.7112,1.4387,0.6325,2.0275,3.1058,6.1106,1.9441,3.572,6.5537,4.4631,2.4805,0.7366,0.1369,1.0619,2.5244,1.4995,2.7958,3.6608,2.9115,0.0004,1.5056,2.4162,3.9944,4.2299,1.1899,5.1612,3.1058,2.7693,2.1742,6.3025,1.6398,4.1078,2.2788,5.383,3.7618,2.3672,2.3357,6.38,1.2858,2.4232,2.2812,4.2892,3.9872,5.0234,7.6582,5.6161,4.726,6.0157,0.7497,4.837,6.3593,5.1298,0.3725,1.6303,8.6102,5.0788,2.1631,2.6907,0.6985,1.3691,6.4551,1.5714,4.0933,2.1736,0.382,0.6467,6.5189,3.6209,3.2173,7.0226,3.3406,5.8564,4.6542,3.1695,2.9859,4.7456,1.6499,3.1171,1.0783,5.5864,1.74,0.8919,0.073,0.3467,0.1658,0.412,6.1413,1.6894,6.6446,3.6481,1.1825,1.6118,1.6012,2.9594,5.1552,7.1097,1.428,1.8011,5.1088,3.8096,1.5271,2.7204,1.681,0.1064,2.1195,6.2446,0.5112,3.7938,0.6012,5.3043,0.4426,0.2605,0.0332,0.0089,0.0087,0.1333,1.0128,0.4846,0.4734,0.0078,0.0104,0.2181,0.5568,0.4244,3.7403,5.8419,5.1591,5.8731,4.4392,4.1581,5.0761,0.6291,5.5836,1.523,7.1624,1.8349,4.3921,3.0081,1.9385,1.1215,1.6841,4.9407,4.4742,4.2716,3.8494,1.9789,2.1171,1.8976,6.2892,1.5199,2.5482,4.285,5.5643,3.2042,0.9831,3.9034,4.1296,2.9295,2.5292,0.8279,3.2324,0.7506,2.8048,1.228,5.0771,4.6361,0.7066,4.0612,2.6596,0.3209,4.5625,0.2913,0.8162,4.9284,4.8361,0.4451,2.774,2.8868,5.0076,1.7108,0.0381,1.2014,3.4924,1.5169,0.1769,1.198,3.183,1.0371,3.3845,6.7365,1.3197,3.9926,3.3812,1.7273,2.7682,1.8156,6.9949,1.3054,2.9874,4.5492,2.8769,0.6001,5.2568,2.1774,2.1027,3.9442,5.9314,4.1846,2.3568,3.6688,1.8687,5.3693,0.0152,1.0413,1.1063,1.9914,0.1663,0.1535,5.8143,1.0199,5.6916,5.5704,2.3228,3.4966,0.4673,2.6255,1.8114,1.0124,0.178,6.9317,0.871,2.0348,1.0855,0.983,2.8313,2.4579,3.7938,1.7402,5.7723,5.0237,6.4418,0.2789,4.9786,1.106,1.2191,1.8378,3.7557,1.6899,1.6814,5.3728,1.8277,0.3687,0.6098,1.4187,3.6762,0.6933,0.9057,1.5516,0.4746,8.8295,1.5853,0.3167,4.4154,2.7484,6.6514,1.4464,1.2612]}

Bush said the system was more advanced than previously discussed, but said the US military would need more funds to combat the threat posed by space radiation.","token_len":302,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.5578,1.8962,1.9547,6.6203,5.3118,2.7952,14.5152,0.1694,3.0187,0.9787,5.5552,2.725,1.0376,2.3229,0.001,1.8658,4.4449,3.293,1.6368,5.0322,6.0559,6.3082,0.152,3.7023,3.415,2.2029,5.2776,5.5543,0.498,1.4213,0.9171,0.0002,3.2764,1.1971,3.4929,2.7359,3.259,3.4047,0.3599,5.4537,2.0905,0.0076,1.9305,4.2328,1.9955,5.2933,1.2457,6.1275,0.0242,0.1683,0.0246,0.0207,0.0788,0.0001,0.1902,0.9887,0.889,3.6481,3.2802,5.8052,0.5935,7.8429,0.2833,2.0245,5.2741,4.9957,0.6797,2.0868,0.246,4.8936,6.237,6.7516,2.3631,9.8586,4.695,4.7342,2.4755,4.0274,5.7938,0.1235,7.5555,3.3313,1.3676,3.2158,0.3298,1.2645,0.1239,2.1525,5.8706,2.0553,2.3604,0.0097,2.7787,0.2435,4.0677,4.7502,1.641,3.3767,0.821,2.6394,5.5751,4.2912,1.44,0.0002,0.4978,1.4384,3.5973,1.4677,2.9926,3.353,0.4359,2.2302,0.0006,0.0015,0.0033,0.9879,0.0931,2.3421,0.2938,0.6699,0.0528,0.3582,0.3628,1.1769,0.1289,0.1365,0.1589,0.8176,0.0211,0.1034,0.0329,0.0051,0.014,0.0699,0.0202,0.1229,0.0032,0.0185,0.0024,0.0382,0.007,0.0084,0.0143,0.0012,0.0076,0.0014,4.3285,0.0039,0.0029,0.0014,0.005,0.0143,0.6999,3.7979,5.8485,0.001,0.0014,0.0023,3.4439,0.0069,2.4438,0.0045,0.8213,0.4335,0.0002,1.9359,3.0996,2.8954,4.7213,3.5479,4.4651,3.5981,0.6141,2.9599,1.5238,4.6915,0.1337,3.3584,3.488,0.9828,4.0785,5.03,5.5514,4.7921,1.926,2.174,0.0754,0.0002,3.013,0.0026,1.1651,0.607,5.4942,4.5533,0.8945,1.0797,7.0694,1.9389,3.3836,5.1609,3.4195,0.0087,1.5928,2.0154,1.414,7.7173,4.8848,1.1768,6.8149,1.7096,1.5782,5.8803,4.9543,1.7458,0.3603,0.0002,1.6574,2.3522,4.7154,0.043,4.1381,1.1727,3.5275,0.193,0.3011,1.6399,6.7927,0.0559,0.2062,0.6304,0.4933,1.0189,0.5945,2.161,4.3461,2.5176,4.9898,1.0111,1.4577,0.5667,1.05,6.8628,1.4845,4.6365,6.2718,6.1226,0.388,3.8888,4.8083,3.3656,0.2751,2.561,1.0285,1.9404,2.9376,3.2187,2.8717,2.503,0.1303,0.0002,5.6877,0.9391,2.1668,0.9324,3.4311,3.1456,0.1372,0.0022,0.0004,1.4408,0.9236,5.2361,1.359,4.5164,3.8387,0.1935,4.5227,7.395,1.355,1.3742,3.5629,1.579,4.7401,1.9192,2.2117,3.3054,2.4706,5.6538,0.545,4.4079,1.3831,0.955,2.7555,0.0387,1.1429,3.6079,0.4344]}

His address will mark the moment in history where we can all take comfort in our President\u2019s words.\n\nFor his speech he\u2019s opening his address with this line;\n\nThe U.S. will return to what we call a more equitable and prosperous world\u2014one where we each have the power to create the jobs, investments, and institutions that we have so long lost.","token_len":304,"entropy":[4.9658,5.2426,5.8505,1.2948,6.159,2.7115,5.637,2.4453,8.0333,2.6751,1.9287,4.1818,7.7598,4.5176,0.8059,17.0164,5.5451,1.3892,9.6995,0.0473,2.4337,1.7796,4.7929,4.2045,0.4034,0.2092,0.0336,6.7433,2.3958,4.839,3.3528,2.0014,0.768,2.2832,0.056,0.8836,1.4881,0.0018,2.502,6.1291,8.3873,6.61,3.8406,4.3571,1.2449,3.8628,2.8977,3.3666,5.4515,4.9401,4.8346,0.0028,2.8611,4.7845,1.8038,3.3047,0.0268,4.1843,4.2882,5.1891,4.6608,1.7108,0.8204,2.8095,1.6159,0.8723,0.9504,1.1449,2.3884,1.3794,2.4354,5.8011,2.3277,6.0643,0.2455,4.055,2.3787,0.0185,0.5916,0.147,1.1108,2.6743,1.9362,3.0539,4.2692,3.0546,4.3354,0.3103,1.0645,6.8361,0.0246,1.6775,1.8381,5.59,1.5359,3.2413,1.4511,6.0806,2.7537,0.452,0.9582,0.0002,2.5869,0.8591,4.0369,5.6863,3.6008,0.8283,5.2472,5.9772,0.4333,3.1282,4.7154,3.624,6.5179,3.1444,1.1355,3.2995,0.0437,0.1369,4.8457,4.1188,2.2197,0.4746,0.732,0.3755,5.6237,0.0649,1.3256,1.45,6.9359,4.8293,4.2688,1.2077,0.8101,1.7044,1.447,1.4013,2.7526,0.0515,1.2886,4.746,4.2919,0.431,1.0672,3.317,2.0033,0.0935,0.3047,0.0228,5.2493,4.5676,2.4484,6.0839,0.238,0.4289,0.0002,1.7061,3.9142,0.9173,0.0791,0.0268,0.0031,5.0716,3.5018,2.6786,2.6365,4.7169,1.6467,2.5165,3.5059,7.103,0.1595,0.5227,3.0723,3.3695,1.4176,0.1695,3.569,1.3458,5.1867,2.2346,0.6071,2.3417,10.4512,0.5136,4.9537,1.1233,0.0002,3.7735,0.5797,2.1614,4.972,0.9476,3.2186,0.4973,2.043,2.7582,1.8328,4.2589,0.1913,1.1051,2.7181,2.6139,1.1307,4.0368,3.8475,3.9007,0.0052,3.8027,4.7688,7.326,1.2305,1.0846,5.9068,2.0709,0.0365,4.2725,4.5634,2.8139,2.5059,0.639,5.0798,3.2205,0.27,4.0158,0.6678,4.9278,3.2384,1.0442,2.7434,1.339,2.8874,2.9292,3.8098,6.3387,0.6223,2.5959,3.5949,15.158,6.9653,5.8988,3.1484,0.9885,0.3835,0.0002,4.6475,4.0416,3.9841,3.318,13.4352,0.6792,0.0413,6.9621,2.0787,4.2517,1.6739,3.6262,3.7473,6.6097,1.1411,0.0002,3.9102,5.638,0.0035,0.0112,0.0614,2.285,6.0186,0.2906,5.9199,1.6276,3.2989,2.9911,5.3922,4.8902,1.5226,2.6574,0.5714,4.7256,2.5657,1.022,2.7011,6.7474,1.1568,1.5485,3.2534,0.1569,2.7191,2.923,4.0989,1.6517,6.081,0.4945,0.6209,7.8353,0.6247,1.8532,2.652,3.1805,1.5725,6.0393,0.5426]}

{"id":1539,"ended":false,"length":295,"text":"An individual is strictly vegetarian due to their being cursed with receiving visions of the final moments of anything they eat. A detective desperate to stop a rampant serial killer challenges them to break the ultimate taboo.\n\nThe book is intended to be a spiritual work of literature that can be read by all ages and at any time, regardless of how old or young you are. The author of the book can be forgiven for being a bit cynical on her experiences with vampires; the story begins with a violent murder committed by a mentally ill man and goes down from there.\n\nThe book follows a man and a girl named Sarah and are kept in an isolation cell until they can be given basic access to her house. When the girl is forced to turn her back on her family, she finds herself in a strange world as she attempts to bring them back together for the first time since the death of her father.\n\nThe book is a true story of a woman who has been raped and locked in a cell for more than 20 years and will do anything to get where she wants to go. The woman has experienced all of these terrible horrors and they will do anything to get where they want, or at least try to have it back and to survive.\n\nThe story is the story of a woman who has been raped and locked in a cell for more than 20 years and will do anything to get where she wants, or at least try to have it back and to survive.\n\nFiled under: Book of Bible, Romance","token_len":306,"entropy":[7.2085,3.4541,9.3087,10.9534,6.7291,0.0065,1.6369,5.8247,8.1234,0.8054,10.1663,6.3045,1.0181,1.9282,6.7509,4.7809,0.1323,8.9644,1.8972,2.3907,0.6241,3.7769,11.617,11.2881,0.2473,4.9096,1.2333,9.2317,4.6469,0.0586,10.7883,2.5774,0.2542,5.8357,1.2785,8.7051,1.729,1.677,1.5172,0.0045,2.554,4.4175,1.3982,6.0947,0.689,0.903,0.8682,5.7506,6.4332,1.7645,3.6539,2.6553,3.2552,0.539,0.8365,1.5715,2.7049,1.7352,1.3115,4.3694,2.193,2.0964,2.4993,3.5076,0.021,3.4683,2.8201,1.378,1.3181,1.0068,0.0939,0.1572,2.1957,2.5378,3.5574,0.9982,0.6319,5.1909,1.1226,8.1111,0.1268,2.7083,1.8183,2.0962,4.9974,4.127,4.4731,6.7811,1.53,4.3436,4.7477,2.9662,4.0169,4.7659,0.6907,1.1677,7.4128,3.4965,4.1028,0.4637,0.5262,5.6687,0.8483,1.4328,2.5807,4.806,5.4801,6.053,0.0558,0.3404,1.4834,0.0003,1.5386,1.5585,4.7113,1.3986,2.8416,3.5092,1.4617,2.9271,2.1016,5.375,3.3357,5.2926,5.6449,0.9178,2.5766,4.5628,0.8871,2.286,0.8681,3.5754,1.6341,4.3453,6.9692,5.6741,0.0817,5.3735,5.9025,0.6857,3.0378,1.8276,2.6153,2.076,4.207,0.1758,5.0977,2.5394,1.0115,0.1693,1.0599,1.8039,0.6309,1.0235,3.4771,0.8823,2.1303,0.919,2.8898,2.0419,5.0285,1.2087,4.0162,0.0228,5.5773,3.8096,0.6854,2.7986,4.6773,1.0992,0.2985,0.0005,2.3209,1.8553,3.5152,0.032,0.2209,1.3952,0.2506,0.7878,0.0002,1.2803,1.1565,1.0691,2.3506,4.731,1.5287,1.5967,2.6283,2.7081,0.8967,2.2366,1.445,5.0648,1.2024,5.6309,0.8232,0.4214,2.3844,0.8747,3.6847,0.0037,3.0978,0.0885,2.3607,4.7236,4.9309,0.267,0.3677,2.51,6.7269,0.0401,2.6437,0.7781,0.5998,0.4752,1.8872,4.4402,2.8125,5.7841,3.795,1.4183,2.536,4.6229,4.5783,1.2389,3.9578,2.7139,3.9605,0.0546,0.3682,0.8285,2.8956,1.7275,0.1243,4.7951,4.9816,1.1936,0.1519,3.5,0.717,7.2134,2.263,6.4127,4.2952,4.5302,4.484,0.4369,0.8093,0.0002,1.2035,2.2815,1.3015,5.4008,1.4749,0.0533,1.068,1.2548,0.427,1.5214,0.4789,1.1255,0.5183,0.2577,0.0449,0.2028,0.2288,0.1235,0.0694,0.0026,0.0133,0.0006,0.1213,0.166,0.1329,0.0167,0.0219,0.0127,0.0096,0.003,0.0021,7.0605,0.0054,0.0023,0.0006,0.0717,0.0038,0.0347,0.0038,0.002,0.0099,0.0082,0.0377,0.0443,1.143,0.0002,5.4235,6.0716,0.1654,0.2012,4.2551,2.532,7.9295,1.9925,5.0048]}
{"id":2913,"ended":true,"length":294,"text":"Humanity has contacted hundreds of alien civilizations. All of them have one legend in common -- the fat guy in a red suit who gives gifts to good little children.\n\nThe book The Big Sick is a delightful, if a bit boring -- and, of course, pretty bad -- treatise on a subject that was probably first discovered by another human being in an alien cave. But it did get published in an edited volume called The Big Sick. The book, which has been translated into dozens of languages, is a fascinating historical and political study of how humans and evolution became so intertwined and how they got to where they did. In particular, how we learned to live together so well. One man even built a big fish that had the capability of eating everything in sight. The book also speaks to the people of those times when we were very young, as a way of saying good bye to a disease that was killing our fellow men more than anything else in the world.\n\nIt is not in any way shocking to anybody that there may have been more than one human being who contributed to the life that we have now in modern America. Not a lot of people have time for that. We live for a purpose. There is always the human being who needs our support and that's where this book shows up, but it is inextricably linked to our human nature, which is just as important to us as it is to all of us.\n\nThe Book of the Big Sick is published by HarperCollins.","token_len":306,"entropy":[7.4121,3.3745,9.6757,7.5003,0.0197,10.2115,3.1068,2.9448,4.58,1.4577,0.4538,1.4407,5.9518,11.7514,3.9927,0.3809,5.2039,1.8404,10.6033,4.2692,2.8522,2.2487,4.0109,1.5844,2.4254,5.3075,6.0345,0.5752,6.5207,7.06,3.9273,0.5544,2.1787,0.0009,2.1981,5.7979,4.4432,3.1084,4.6789,1.9275,1.9267,6.8984,2.5313,3.7915,3.8973,1.1961,4.6067,6.3259,2.1475,3.425,3.6018,0.0112,0.0048,5.1423,3.841,2.713,3.6659,1.3171,0.3389,3.4385,1.9783,0.8059,4.4771,5.0186,5.2318,4.4855,1.0579,5.6784,2.4493,1.7297,2.1762,3.8204,0.9182,4.0264,0.79,2.9602,1.5784,5.3292,3.1883,3.7955,1.3521,4.466,5.7112,2.8273,3.7161,1.005,0.9817,0.0688,1.983,2.4281,0.807,2.6436,1.354,2.6585,1.2821,1.429,0.2555,4.7743,0.0369,0.0537,0.3658,1.3319,1.9396,2.8729,4.9179,2.4268,2.7231,3.0662,0.4056,2.6751,3.0333,2.4754,7.0202,4.2948,2.2682,1.2613,2.7198,1.9209,2.2332,4.2747,1.984,1.4325,0.4383,7.1382,0.2504,3.9984,3.8938,0.0777,5.5919,2.4809,5.0066,0.6896,2.9093,2.1765,4.7257,1.3972,1.7128,5.7427,5.0216,4.6004,6.2425,0.3447,4.8401,5.8569,5.051,4.1183,3.4591,5.7595,0.7889,2.4564,4.1435,1.6878,1.1395,0.6777,2.6743,0.8401,2.6918,6.1578,1.4514,1.0797,5.8054,2.2074,5.0829,3.6516,3.8943,2.1129,1.5994,4.3065,2.8613,1.2658,4.3623,3.5142,2.619,0.5918,3.9662,6.8525,3.2003,0.2409,3.7393,7.2464,0.6955,2.0014,2.785,2.5371,5.905,3.5377,7.7252,1.1813,2.9688,0.7696,2.6778,1.0752,0.4113,0.1877,0.564,0.0002,3.2763,2.1406,3.2339,5.5852,2.5877,0.1887,6.1629,1.2252,6.1847,0.6736,3.8021,4.3816,1.4657,0.0367,3.8735,2.2619,0.6994,2.1796,1.301,2.8451,4.6338,0.2232,1.1567,5.8404,4.7413,1.1793,1.7439,2.0525,4.6304,4.9493,3.1814,0.3032,5.3403,3.502,3.0081,0.4532,0.7552,2.5679,7.1214,1.5343,1.0024,1.4366,3.2002,3.1504,5.6922,2.1192,4.798,1.1191,3.851,1.1185,4.5155,3.2952,5.1859,3.5753,1.1108,4.6912,3.8163,3.1017,1.7932,4.4751,2.1621,4.462,3.5742,0.2108,6.7984,4.5518,3.1203,2.9873,1.2387,1.8217,4.2407,6.2863,0.0006,0.0244,0.8462,0.4264,2.4987,4.4705,3.9725,2.2744,2.2657,0.4763,5.0185,1.1016,1.2797,1.7502,0.7813,0.281,1.5134,0.063,0.1488,3.5131,0.8199,0.7701,0.1879,0.8434,0.0002,2.6175,5.5528,0.5503,1.9914,1.7608,0.0197,1.1448,2.1807,0.4046,2.8921,0.2087,1.2346]}

Because quantum technologies are \"the new way of knowing\" and because they are more widely and cheaply available in most areas, it is easier to use, easier to learn, and more flexible.\n\nTo that end, the first quantum computer is made, or at first it was made, by quantum computers that have already solved and solved a fundamental human problem\n\nSo what is the first quantum computer?\n\nHere is a brief summary as well as more than a dozen links to an article originally posted on the website of quantum researchers at the University of New South Wales :","token_len":308,"entropy":[5.3423,9.5928,2.5259,2.142,8.1403,1.8579,2.7267,3.8424,7.2234,4.778,0.0013,0.0455,7.8557,3.9582,4.1806,13.8753,12.7874,2.2105,1.9852,5.7712,6.2408,2.4565,6.5662,4.5499,1.9582,9.7147,1.0845,8.6732,7.0488,6.7551,1.6591,1.9014,2.4747,2.5258,5.7894,5.4862,4.017,4.8597,6.5591,7.7583,2.1177,2.592,1.3814,3.0855,5.9636,0.6788,2.6685,0.0062,1.8572,3.2846,0.4889,0.0634,0.442,1.9311,0.3087,0.3562,0.1483,0.1371,0.094,0.0024,0.0021,0.0043,0.0206,0.008,0.022,0.4457,0.0026,0.0014,3.1666,0.0041,0.0207,0.0054,0.0017,0.0013,0.0287,0.0021,0.3266,0.0054,0.0028,0.0015,0.0003,0.0011,0.0053,0.0018,0.0046,0.0026,0.0047,0.0054,0.0042,0.0019,0.0008,0.001,0.001,0.0011,0.0016,0.8751,0.0002,4.5034,3.2664,5.3002,4.6234,0.8948,6.4627,0.1646,1.465,1.6404,1.497,3.3898,0.0009,4.307,1.4021,4.9421,1.1058,0.6032,3.8788,2.765,2.672,0.9249,4.8757,3.2572,3.7556,2.275,0.4735,2.2372,0.6151,2.856,2.096,2.7903,5.6815,4.5364,5.2488,3.1604,1.073,0.9732,3.7566,4.1339,1.6251,4.0111,2.2097,0.3789,7.3293,3.7855,1.062,0.8637,0.2114,0.7558,0.0002,4.1485,3.583,6.2274,4.7522,0.6327,0.8491,5.9278,2.0318,1.915,0.3245,3.46,2.9884,2.9571,4.6405,1.851,5.1164,0.8996,5.8285,3.082,4.0007,1.4244,4.959,2.1241,5.3447,4.7846,5.156,1.7827,0.149,0.4314,6.1775,4.8346,0.144,2.1266,6.6491,3.5101,2.0204,3.7515,0.0009,6.3617,4.9503,0.7458,1.0128,0.0002,5.5647,2.7219,0.6583,2.3897,6.8678,1.2322,6.1434,4.502,3.0371,4.9715,0.6986,4.1075,2.1769,1.1007,3.2736,1.2936,1.6097,4.486,5.5001,5.059,3.0307,0.7555,4.2468,4.7825,1.8317,3.3468,4.2887,1.5668,2.8734,0.6895,2.6286,3.0788,5.2916,0.0414,2.9049,0.6738,0.8938,1.9975,4.695,0.9537,0.6248,0.0002,4.396,4.2213,0.0573,0.0748,2.1086,3.6639,0.8166,0.1506,0.8613,4.8737,2.7369,7.2728,3.6671,9.0193,4.0973,1.1715,0.6302,0.4859,1.8261,4.2133,1.9134,3.5915,2.4515,4.4004,5.1739,6.1181,2.2724,2.6232,4.8597,8.3244,0.2906,7.2164,0.0003,4.3151,2.5104,1.8748,1.3893,3.553,0.3457,0.0871,0.2692,1.1513,0.0001,5.4023,1.5958,1.0661,3.5138,2.4414,6.7572,2.8836,0.3496,5.097,4.6597,1.0243,2.7174,4.3005,0.8889,6.08,2.0703,6.1299,2.6293,1.043,1.8463,3.3479,0.8447,4.8808,5.5002,1.5807,1.3257,0.9174,0.0044,4.7592,1.1074,0.0011,8.0982]}

{"id":2750,"ended":true,"length":299,"text":"Because spirit animals don't exist, scientists have created a machine that analyses a person and creates a unique robot that acts as their spirit animal. It's your turn to get yours.\nI don't think spirit animals exist. They have souls too so I suppose they can, but no such thing as a soul being a spirit animal.\nYes, but, if they existed, then \"Spirit animal\" would be defined as an animal that can reproduce outside the body. So, the question is how will we define \"spirit animal\" in the body?\nThe animal is different to the creature because the animal isn't related to it. Therefore, \"spirit animal\" is an animal that's spirit animal (i.e. the creature that had the soul), because the substance in the animal is considered as not as human.  Or you can say \"Spirit animal\" is \"spirit animal\" because the whole \"spirit animal\" thing is animal-like.\nWhat do you mean is the animal that is in the body has both spirits that are in the body AND spirits that aren't?\nJust an example that should be noted in any theory where there are other forms of matter that have evolved.

Thus, in order to know what the message message means, the interpreter must be read in English and use correct translations.\n\nIt is also nice that you can keep the message message secret, since there is not any case of hacking the message messaging system.","token_len":312,"entropy":[6.8149,6.9571,1.1199,3.6077,4.9718,1.4003,3.3469,7.1402,4.3093,5.3076,1.8744,7.0975,9.0309,0.1423,3.6287,2.1278,3.8196,4.2365,2.4056,0.9359,0.9495,5.9869,8.5098,0.0063,1.4637,0.3275,4.9902,0.6146,8.047,1.2017,2.3737,5.1867,3.325,11.4012,1.0917,3.5901,2.2132,1.3246,5.8514,7.2148,8.8898,0.0086,2.8861,1.0248,1.1624,0.0007,2.57,2.3792,0.9975,5.1058,5.6302,1.9687,3.8071,0.1683,1.0514,0.5371,1.2267,3.2509,2.1039,3.1703,7.3812,4.2474,2.5782,4.3652,5.5283,3.8094,1.9152,2.8041,5.1809,4.0478,7.1479,8.3823,0.9958,1.4181,0.0002,4.1506,0.8134,1.8341,2.4225,0.0156,1.8507,1.6415,1.682,0.0002,1.4741,3.2362,3.2647,0.6723,5.7283,0.7171,5.8409,1.2567,0.7755,1.2257,2.1538,0.3798,0.7726,1.5507,1.0464,0.0002,1.067,2.7019,2.3432,0.6118,2.2427,0.2678,0.3351,0.5018,0.2585,0.0486,0.0639,0.3753,0.1239,0.0002,1.5032,1.7598,0.1376,0.0277,0.1753,0.4197,0.763,0.0919,0.0313,0.0578,0.0117,0.0123,0.0151,5.934,0.9067,1.077,2.9876,4.2468,1.0461,1.702,6.5201,1.8081,9.4938,1.2903,3.2971,3.4635,4.1918,2.9596,6.1361,1.586,4.5345,5.0399,1.8011,3.6359,3.0409,4.2212,4.1094,0.0016,0.0005,0.6911,3.1248,6.4165,3.847,3.619,1.4479,0.962,4.7084,3.6213,1.964,2.323,1.0821,5.5977,3.3209,2.5232,1.1036,1.2399,4.1215,4.8959,0.8204,0.3848,0.0003,5.8433,2.3918,1.6905,4.1893,6.684,1.6038,1.6375,1.1603,4.7213,4.4704,1.0932,1.8468,3.062,2.9427,2.7264,7.3387,0.8099,2.3975,4.3317,0.3987,1.5496,1.6078,3.3632,0.9182,4.1669,3.4979,5.174,5.4778,4.68,4.9994,1.4233,1.0646,5.6763,4.5527,1.9382,3.6077,0.5036,1.268,0.0743,0.5892,2.4781,3.4333,0.3801,0.4839,0.0002,5.8034,0.3902,0.1113,0.0124,0.0415,1.8414,5.8676,0.4603,3.0306,1.0866,0.7606,2.7067,4.5095,2.4591,0.8717,1.3507,0.997,3.0693,0.7312,0.8014,0.0002,5.6616,2.9997,1.5466,3.7623,6.9045,0.4417,0.976,5.4258,0.3894,2.6034,6.8524,3.2571,3.7951,0.2577,0.4748,2.9668,2.2951,1.0103,5.5144,0.4363,3.5907,0.6755,0.2077,4.3431,2.4436,1.4056,1.0724,5.0309,1.3006,0.5828,3.4934,5.5125,1.8316,2.6115,6.7315,2.3882,1.1393,2.8149,4.2665,1.0511,0.6012,0.8938,0.366,0.0002,4.1976,0.7156,2.7285,6.6319,2.8644,1.2313,0.4446,5.482,1.9574,2.6176,3.4794,6.5954,1.8681,2.6296,3.7494,0.7775,4.1285,2.579,6.0113,2.3343,6.4672,1.9671,1.8249,8.5899,1.2332,0.9045]}

You can make it a comedy, romance, etc. Have Fun!\nI write my best, but I have to work hard to achieve perfection here. ;)\nSo what you're saying, is that you write yourself off as trash-bag, so you end up making \"fancy\" love stories?\nA lot of the people on this sub love writing, but I can't do much with it, especially when it's this difficult. It's my job to make my personality and I enjoy every once in a while, so...\nIt isn't always about writing.  I've had some of my best love stories, where I have a guy I know read a book to me to talk about stuff I enjoyed.  Sometimes there was a good reason to write them, too.  I've gone through that phase of writing off as trash and it has gotten more comfortable and easier to write in that order.  So there's definitely going to be some learning curve I've had to work out :)\nI think that's where you are wrong. A lot of the time writing and working out in the same way is much the same thing as writing about what you know. That's why I write, but sometimes you have to work hard to get it done. Don't let it be something that you don't do at all. It's one of the best parts about writing that when you write about who you are, you'll feel really good.\nSounds good to me.

The article states the Alien is actually that of a woman, who is actually that of a man.\n\nIn the article I looked at an image that shows a woman in a skirt who is wearing a bikini and only looking for sex.

NASA's \"NASA Day\" will start with a short ceremony on June 10 or 11 and will continue until the US and SLS launch at 11 and 12:30 am Eastern Standard Time.\n\nOn April 9, the International Space Station will return to Earth as part of the US Expedition 57 crew, an expedition originally intended to test the system's space-based functionality, but has been delayed until this time due to poor fuel economy.","token_len":319,"entropy":[9.0511,5.8215,6.136,3.2852,3.8138,4.3647,7.2261,6.3084,0.0011,3.0167,8.4301,1.1368,3.3598,9.7625,7.6003,0.8842,2.714,0.5888,2.4393,7.3094,1.9579,1.6254,11.351,0.7694,8.0205,3.802,1.4345,9.8872,6.9519,0.9831,0.8035,1.3878,5.5223,0.9433,2.5965,3.6484,2.2132,5.0906,2.5165,8.8345,3.8528,1.0456,5.6899,0.1361,0.0192,5.5271,0.8892,1.1565,0.0058,2.0438,4.1892,1.4131,2.2466,5.8926,6.9704,0.3144,4.263,0.1074,3.2526,0.1819,1.9117,2.1026,3.7587,4.5858,0.0158,1.9029,4.3037,1.6953,0.2117,4.6711,1.6128,5.9569,0.6319,0.7617,4.0659,3.426,2.4249,0.2945,1.8643,1.9524,2.6121,1.248,5.9401,0.7629,0.026,2.1826,5.0088,5.6414,0.2338,1.9441,0.5628,1.7465,2.739,2.086,3.9466,2.9833,3.9862,3.3569,0.1231,0.01,2.5255,1.7692,1.3779,4.528,0.0378,1.4797,1.8997,7.3347,0.0013,4.7131,0.4837,0.7914,0.0002,4.6164,5.31,0.2574,1.7387,0.0965,0.2355,0.8495,3.3072,0.0674,0.5447,1.0168,4.2314,0.8695,4.6733,1.1117,2.0806,3.5066,3.665,3.6596,0.2098,1.4157,1.0864,5.1645,2.2221,5.6518,0.1362,0.5407,0.0504,3.9589,3.8253,1.772,0.278,0.9242,1.26,0.0003,6.0097,1.9791,5.9739,0.8206,0.2127,2.383,0.2137,6.0573,1.0829,0.5248,7.9813,0.1776,0.6889,4.3186,3.4275,1.8318,0.0255,5.5715,4.453,2.0799,3.2654,3.4042,0.1046,1.0837,4.1963,5.6446,3.7476,2.0793,1.4541,8.6517,8.6923,3.9278,0.1973,7.0697,2.5371,4.6741,2.3801,1.8068,3.1456,5.2285,0.0261,4.9345,2.8106,2.9381,2.4636,1.7091,1.8953,4.1517,7.1217,3.0143,2.9678,0.4138,0.0006,4.4611,1.4462,0.1374,4.0438,3.819,1.2961,2.5407,3.0498,0.5305,1.7748,0.2605,0.0004,0.1742,3.933,5.4901,0.9917,1.4327,5.2775,4.8703,5.9398,5.7299,2.7334,0.4815,3.9544,1.2612,3.4783,5.3268,0.7934,2.1018,3.4984,2.1512,6.5993,6.6612,5.3872,0.4424,2.344,3.4839,4.3807,1.0326,4.8718,2.5207,2.0817,3.7818,3.5111,6.9227,0.2033,2.9388,2.1993,2.8025,1.6152,1.3247,3.3404,3.8112,6.4253,0.0017,1.8157,4.2353,2.7229,6.7845,0.985,1.2841,0.5656,3.3218,4.9126,2.3881,0.0453,1.4038,0.407,0.0003,4.9487,3.5911,3.4005,0.4185,1.7342,3.1883,0.0543,0.0048,0.6835,3.4055,0.2616,0.8877,3.1405,1.1734,0.0008,1.0861,3.8419,6.8157,5.3099,1.5742,2.2847,4.975,3.1374,5.9595,3.0159,0.1009,4.5485,1.2042,5.3633,0.7369,5.6445,2.1851,1.3766,7.266,2.8238,0.911,2.7904,0.9429,1.3696,3.1338,4.9952,4.126,2.0709,0.0071,5.3057,4.9338,5.3319,0.6855]}

It's a nice little game where you can play and play it free of charge. I especially liked the mechanics where you're able to customize your character without playing to the exact mechanics you were expecting. My only qualm is that as long as you get all the cards, you will have to spend a lot of time on the battlefield to get those cards. But being a competitive game that uses card advantage (which it does almost constantly, but also only occasionally) I think that this will appeal to many folks.

The orginal four must come to an agreement on who will remain a horseman.\n\nThe book is intended to be a companion work to a much longer story. The author has written about his own experiences while working as a horseman. It will be up to readers to decide if \"war\" will be involved in these experiences.\n\nThis is the story we came up with to share with you, if you'd like to hear more about what happens to the humans during the event if you'd like to receive an eBook.\n\n\"If we only put our hands up against the ground,\" (Genesis 1:17)\n\nThe words \"War... will be replaced\" never occurred to me. I thought you were giving out a nice reference to \"genesis\" here. Thank you very much for sharing this!\n\nI am in the midst of reading the book that is in the sequel to \"The Dark Shadows,\" and all of the characters have all come to understand what we are doing.

They want children to be strong and kind, so the kids won't get hurt while they're at it.\nYes, but, if they're only children?  I have a feeling the more grown up the adults are the less likely we are to see them being strong.  Just my 2 cents though.\nNope. It's the parents fault, if they don't enjoy playing, they'll go along with it and turn things around.\nThat's fair if you had to deal with the other parent.  But it wasn't a parent fault as much as it was the people they cared about.  They were always nice to kids and parents.  I'm a \"mom\" so that's a factor, but I don't think the parents would choose that sort of thing over kids.  Maybe they would have let their kids be kids, I don't know.\nMaybe they would have let their kids be adults or had some form of education, but I don't think the parents would have let the kids be adults without parental support.\nThat's what I'm saying, maybe they would have let their kids be adults.  Maybe their kids were adults.  Maybe they wanted to do this because they felt confident in their kids being great parents.   But of course I'm not sure how parent-parent relationship is affected.  Sometimes families are far more similar than other relationships.  That's why I'm not sure.","token_len":325,"entropy":[3.5106,6.2785,6.9791,0.4094,3.7529,6.4937,2.9584,1.7373,1.3895,2.9482,1.2312,1.5978,1.0855,0.4782,2.9619,5.0991,0.6368,5.085,15.4492,0.0025,0.4794,0.7994,5.8508,3.1111,0.001,1.7856,2.5946,3.4776,2.9537,1.3714,2.0829,1.2707,3.1289,0.9493,1.115,4.5558,1.3005,5.4757,1.5668,3.8798,4.5953,2.922,4.6265,0.0008,3.0259,1.5663,5.9785,0.6704,0.4917,2.8845,1.0111,0.2428,2.1995,5.7769,0.2605,3.404,4.9859,3.2816,1.3625,2.2249,5.3413,5.4471,6.4188,6.9274,8.7084,4.203,1.6157,2.4998,3.3483,4.5343,6.4149,0.9842,2.1841,7.3471,1.0664,2.4124,2.2595,1.5439,4.0861,0.6752,0.0603,3.2119,1.4631,4.3972,3.1486,1.5605,2.4429,5.6822,5.0455,5.7701,0.0753,5.4478,0.4064,0.8464,6.2694,1.2718,1.0539,3.8058,0.3948,3.3751,3.4656,7.6164,2.3332,5.2687,1.0288,2.0872,0.0005,7.4982,4.1253,3.3583,1.275,1.8935,3.7063,4.9643,0.2778,0.9523,2.0609,5.9419,5.6592,0.1523,0.5079,1.6282,4.0517,0.6271,6.5897,6.2013,1.225,6.0241,1.6162,5.0058,0.012,2.0563,4.2498,3.8611,1.9861,1.9442,2.8792,2.957,5.489,0.0006,3.0185,3.0911,3.0159,3.9625,1.9656,0.1112,0.7803,0.1734,1.8343,6.2905,4.5156,4.4288,0.3995,0.6519,1.045,2.5506,1.9524,5.1475,4.5649,1.6661,4.1961,1.352,5.5429,1.377,0.6765,2.4224,2.1593,3.6212,5.7155,4.6207,1.3297,2.5651,3.1029,0.6508,2.8484,5.3936,2.486,0.6355,1.4172,1.6489,0.0007,0.9006,2.8433,2.5148,3.0769,5.4943,2.4426,5.161,0.0026,1.8515,3.5064,3.9422,0.585,1.3165,3.906,1.6667,1.8366,2.018,5.2978,2.0351,0.343,2.8384,4.513,1.9718,4.585,0.6753,0.0005,0.1492,0.2805,1.2388,4.1661,1.4006,1.6029,0.325,2.2041,0.4454,0.1758,0.6588,2.8815,3.8471,5.4928,3.0162,3.9525,0.0019,4.9709,2.001,0.9768,1.7717,0.4147,0.0005,0.7971,2.8751,0.9851,0.2176,1.0666,2.5681,3.3142,0.2291,0.8152,0.7275,6.0519,4.4059,3.3083,0.396,1.5884,3.3686,0.3728,3.5132,1.3342,1.7066,0.8493,1.6884,5.5855,1.8046,0.9309,0.2042,0.9856,0.8296,0.1099,0.216,0.5673,1.9568,0.7685,2.0587,3.9199,0.9661,3.6517,4.1064,2.5997,0.6396,1.1308,0.7085,3.7514,0.575,3.7876,4.2434,3.4663,0.4627,2.6351,6.8484,1.7987,0.7846,1.9835,4.2548,6.2074,2.4585,0.9308,0.5357,5.7414,2.1049,5.8494,0.0192,2.9228,1.7812,0.6831,2.0767,2.7892,8.653,1.9408,4.0924,2.7705,2.1482,5.1364,2.7985,1.0977,5.1226,6.7524,2.0661,6.4123,0.7312,5.6885,0.5667,1.1886,3.9664,0.6681,1.0654,4.1689,0.6016,1.5678,0.9759,1.9572,1.1884,0.486,3.1156]}

Also I don't use the \"e\" in the beginning of her words.\nit makes sense to use 'e' in a way","token_len":329,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,6.9577,3.5268,2.1962,7.5,1.9275,3.9289,0.5057,10.5733,1.6437,6.848,2.9257,5.1233,0.8864,1.8489,0.6814,3.6201,2.9122,3.9775,1.0971,5.6188,0.7328,4.2265,3.0457,3.5041,6.787,3.9777,2.0261,5.868,4.1122,1.9031,4.3084,0.8689,4.9594,1.3639,2.7758,3.845,2.5207,3.9702,1.1194,1.2215,1.7614,0.5717,0.5471,4.0026,5.7399,3.8445,1.516,1.4523,13.8648,0.6105,2.3444,3.8786,1.6777,3.9527,6.9627,5.5295,2.9537,5.9976,2.3016,0.4102,0.8735,1.7952,2.9527,5.1091,0.6562,7.0628,5.5653,6.3167,5.1412,4.0003,3.8643,1.9854,6.5432,6.0987,2.993,0.6779,4.1909,1.795,8.3641,5.5074,5.4543,0.2281,2.2813,2.0779,0.4759,4.6748,2.7773,1.9712,5.1687,3.8663,8.0096,6.2779,4.4793,6.8121,0.0009,2.1519,2.3864,0.4083,5.1957,4.0251,3.2423,3.7757,4.3839,12.8266,7.3047,4.2691,1.2733,8.6591,2.2406,5.0248,3.821,1.9531,2.3691,0.5757,4.8042,2.4804,1.6008,4.4897,5.2003,1.8207,3.4842,2.0117,2.7669,5.9728,1.1923,4.549,3.3111,1.8039,1.9687,4.822,6.3801,1.9173,4.5417,1.2159,4.8737,1.354,1.1248,6.0157,2.7451,4.6843,2.7192,3.3324,5.5081,3.9381,5.5967,3.0519,1.4776,3.6701,1.5923,1.5957,0.8821,1.5384,7.4689,6.2095,4.3389,1.0882,0.3207,0.0086,0.0064,0.5249,5.0523,0.0903,0.1482,0.1428,0.9128,2.3256,5.9678,3.6906,2.3371,3.1949,1.7701,2.3331,1.2272,0.0309,5.5084,0.7078,6.6749,4.9017,2.013,4.0613,5.3279,3.1621,2.1099,4.0406,3.7908,1.1124,1.0569,4.5592,1.2615,4.5219,2.6896,2.9995,2.9955,4.1315,4.0989,4.8627,5.7534,4.6448,4.7014,1.6049,3.2662,1.613,5.1719,2.0263,3.5135,2.7527,0.7792,0.5602,1.1059,5.6725,7.0345,1.8311,2.7767,2.3043,3.3719,2.7684,1.0452,0.7016,1.1843,0.4378,3.754,4.6484,2.6662,4.3759,7.9521,4.7641,2.9631,4.297,1.4533,2.5539,0.426,2.8367,4.7119,2.8763,3.5288,5.0555,0.1073,1.3515,3.3254,5.6255,3.5315,5.4408,5.9721,2.1294,3.6863,0.7371,1.7575,1.7781,1.1467,1.1329,1.0402,5.2087,2.8512,3.026,6.0036,3.8963,4.7116,2.6368,1.3212,6.532,1.6043,0.4264,2.3714,4.9446,2.4089,4.1893,5.8554,2.4858,5.1004,6.9063,5.3726,4.773,3.0766,2.3662,7.0699,1.6509,0.4927,5.0464,2.1436,4.7928,1.3099,3.5809,1.1634,1.8612,2.3609,4.1561,5.0873,5.5001,0.6854,3.9975,1.2489,2.5464,1.9269,4.3418,0.3768,5.3756,5.4949,0.559,5.7072,3.9577,1.9889,0.0016,2.6686,1.9578,2.1977,2.0202,0.1268,1.0964,0.8434,2.2512,1.3302,3.453,3.258,1.5901,1.4076,5.4749,3.8091,2.6888,1.8102,1.4392,5.9926,0.7131,0.1214,1.4659,2.7116,2.1598]}

It's the people that make all we do. If I can't pay my bills, I can't pay my mother's bills. They will just eat me if I don't pay them.  That being said, I would never put a woman in position of power if it meant being held accountable for that. The last thing I'd want to do is have them do all those crazy people stuff for me.\n> If I can't pay my bills, I can't pay my mother's bills. They will just eat me if I don't pay them.  You would have to have some sort of legal obligation to collect all your debts in any given year.  It's just not ethical to go to a court and spend a year having to pay for unpaid bills and to have your mother repay you for all the unpaid bills\nOh God. That would be horrible! I'm the one that's actually in debt because I owed my father all this debt. Then my husband came down at my house and gave me a second debt to pay out of and I couldn't pay it off. I got married last semester, but I only paid the bills for 6 months. But I was completely on the offensive that month-plus, because a month or so after I got married I went in again and I already owe the debt.","token_len":339,"entropy":[3.7506,3.3197,2.6769,0.0879,3.4775,9.7733,6.1812,10.228,1.7064,5.5642,3.4764,1.4312,6.0247,3.3463,3.6713,1.0254,6.3701,6.5303,1.5077,1.9327,2.3292,0.7688,0.7828,0.0293,4.408,2.5967,1.6993,3.6478,2.2885,2.9118,2.7407,3.8019,4.3916,0.2766,4.5958,2.676,5.0189,2.5326,4.2102,5.9423,4.3222,0.0096,4.695,2.8701,3.2789,3.3708,0.8144,1.7478,0.879,0.8202,1.3721,12.7517,0.258,4.1059,4.6999,3.8132,7.3196,2.407,6.3332,2.4154,0.011,5.1052,0.5893,3.9196,1.9676,2.1885,5.4702,4.2507,1.194,3.4746,0.6949,2.8805,2.7794,2.3652,2.3909,4.2596,7.3793,1.5309,0.6688,3.2832,3.8585,3.076,1.8734,3.7775,1.0956,0.9354,0.3504,1.1608,1.0736,0.0871,2.5863,0.2298,6.3744,1.5382,0.6087,0.6132,4.826,3.4527,3.5875,5.1261,1.3804,5.2563,0.3726,1.2828,0.0006,1.2483,0.9062,0.3384,9.4835,9.6567,5.8296,0.0393,0.0555,1.5191,3.5417,2.6503,4.4014,2.7348,4.9677,1.5489,5.2715,2.8254,0.8026,3.3545,2.038,1.608,4.0424,4.9714,0.9179,0.7927,5.1614,1.3024,3.6543,5.6825,0.4461,1.05,3.0792,0.3635,1.2555,0.2335,0.2028,3.2018,5.1689,3.5679,4.0063,3.4002,5.5454,5.2219,6.2608,4.1879,0.9829,0.4244,1.3154,9.2808,5.0561,2.0246,0.7869,0.0864,0.0915,0.0389,0.0121,0.0552,0.039,0.009,0.0058,0.0125,0.0096,0.0487,0.0017,0.0052,0.1224,0.6517,0.016,0.0088,0.0076,0.0027,0.0118,0.0014,0.0054,0.0004,0.002,0.0012,0.0448,2.1162,5.0671,4.2369,2.3143,0.683,2.6904,2.8931,1.6064,0.0024,4.4958,4.0768,0.4565,5.9054,2.7746,2.1436,1.9903,3.494,5.1197,2.1074,0.6946,0.7275,2.5981,2.9674,0.881,2.8443,1.6797,6.5142,1.3484,4.2767,1.7983,2.8929,1.9345,1.2539,5.6658,2.3725,1.1933,4.6718,0.9224,0.759,3.0996,7.2847,1.2004,3.16,3.6059,1.8694,2.4769,4.0482,7.3466,0.6508,1.4158,2.7446,1.5603,3.4144,0.9884,8.5876,5.59,5.1986,1.973,3.2021,2.7291,0.4639,4.496,3.4414,2.3164,2.1181,5.3038,1.5945,2.1831,2.4439,4.7145,4.0024,4.0957,3.8532,0.7458,5.2698,1.8085,2.6393,3.853,4.0479,4.9634,0.8444,5.7397,2.6998,4.1298,3.9752,4.6673,6.1044,4.3932,1.2891,1.0361,4.1611,0.2506,1.0586,6.1293,5.3224,2.7851,0.2427,5.245,1.9061,7.3534,1.4457,3.4782,0.0002,0.5348,0.5928,2.5231,0.5667,1.586,4.0408,4.4479,5.702,7.5749,1.9412,2.7069,1.2069,5.117,2.0633,2.5668,3.1841,1.9761,5.001,0.2032,0.8458,5.2544,1.5999,2.5702,6.2707,4.1415,1.0955,9.4385,4.4058,5.7035,7.6509,5.749,2.4781,1.8957,5.6083,2.9229,3.4515,0.9101,2.305,1.4074,1.8604,0.3356,1.4684,3.6159,4.2974,6.3237,0.6724,1.7862,6.1898,3.7578,1.996,2.859,0.9134]}

If the other person had said it to you, then you'd have to change all your mind.   Or you could move on and tell her to find someone less crazy. And then you could move on.\nHe also said that I don't know what is going on because I can't tell him. I guess there's nothing going on. I can't find out how he is doing it, or something. So I guess I know that I have no motivation, but I still have some real feelings and he's the one being wild and crazy.\nSo maybe you just want out, stop worrying about it and just let him know you're still in love. Then you would have to change your mind and maybe move on with your life. But that's just me right now.\nHonestly I think I just need to feel for him. I don't want to talk about my feelings anymore.

Because in movies you can expect to find a plot, a protagonist, and a lot of things that happen, but that doesn''t mean that I ''can'' be an awesome movie star and not understand it at all. That''s because you can understand those themes and parts of the plot and they will still help you understand what's going on in your head. You won''t understand anything else like the film (which means that the movie doesn''t get any screen time or the plot doesn''t get any screen time either way, and the movie still gives you something to go on while you're watching and enjoy).","token_len":342,"entropy":[6.7495,10.1813,3.428,4.5433,6.34,6.51,6.0487,5.4013,3.132,8.1465,4.1364,5.0601,6.8977,5.3014,1.3088,5.586,1.32,0.9352,5.0813,1.4743,4.7356,3.58,3.6219,2.0616,2.7818,3.0679,2.9692,4.0151,0.0022,2.3572,3.4775,3.032,0.9017,5.8811,1.5404,2.7199,3.7364,3.3746,2.7158,0.9999,2.2998,1.7361,0.2981,2.3206,0.042,4.8375,6.137,1.0877,1.2742,6.0974,7.9178,2.5988,1.7923,0.0094,5.2812,0.1065,7.1948,1.5356,4.725,0.284,7.8171,1.7748,1.7823,6.7802,2.152,6.5238,1.5662,4.4469,5.828,2.5339,6.7532,5.3949,3.0854,3.3458,4.8497,2.2968,3.345,0.9921,2.2762,2.3701,0.0203,4.4112,2.1973,0.0003,5.0504,1.813,2.4937,4.341,4.1992,4.4745,2.3889,2.9348,4.8963,0.0362,1.7805,2.5046,1.0897,4.6132,3.7219,3.1747,2.3161,7.7282,0.0607,2.3826,1.3354,0.0056,5.4798,0.5257,4.6968,0.9173,3.6089,0.2353,1.2878,0.0755,0.0034,3.5546,1.4492,2.5266,2.1948,1.4658,4.7334,3.5373,1.0435,6.11,6.2999,3.1543,0.9242,5.7299,4.1326,4.2884,0.6776,3.8956,4.2008,4.4816,6.1883,1.7781,4.8979,2.6026,4.8278,2.2251,3.7724,2.8624,5.652,2.722,2.5861,2.853,2.4624,2.0728,4.732,2.1958,5.0564,1.7371,0.7819,4.1385,3.9727,2.6162,1.2714,2.808,3.2989,4.766,4.9575,3.0419,2.648,7.6066,3.7615,4.9508,2.9387,1.2238,0.8142,3.8946,1.0529,5.1153,1.042,1.0691,4.6382,3.6914,1.9777,2.6863,2.5053,2.9339,0.2374,2.3612,2.3504,4.976,0.5431,1.8633,0.1605,0.0741,0.4399,2.9027,4.3217,0.1739,2.4163,3.3167,2.9591,6.9786,0.6779,0.0002,4.1713,1.4732,2.5781,3.1931,2.1373,2.958,5.8743,1.9221,5.2013,4.8715,4.2285,2.2434,2.2732,0.6037,1.5876,1.6837,5.0417,4.0041,6.6886,1.9747,2.1956,4.8366,1.4001,2.2904,2.3418,5.2238,2.0123,1.5654,6.1466,0.3278,2.0876,0.6556,4.092,0.2152,4.04,1.2328,4.8459,3.8506,1.1197,3.5787,1.86,0.0704,0.0002,0.7143,1.1024,5.1593,4.6635,4.0553,0.0305,4.4866,4.1024,5.1442,0.8625,3.7553,4.0279,4.4202,5.6223,2.6691,3.713,0.5721,0.3941,3.3938,0.4014,0.0456,2.4739,2.621,1.8842,4.0349,5.8733,4.5276,1.3676,7.3213,0.6479,0.5834,1.507,2.3798,5.1961,2.5807,4.3306,4.7759,0.2761,2.4412,1.5147,3.1419,0.3791,0.03,1.1311,2.1521,2.2736,0.9229,3.1148,2.6721,0.0736,0.0097,3.2275,3.6291,2.8146,5.4321,2.3978,5.1881,5.999,2.9368,3.2632,1.1833,2.6033,1.7775,3.0349,0.0541,0.0011,4.424,2.1964,7.4287,0.0283,2.4112,3.8604,2.4391,2.8535,0.005,0.0022,1.2998,1.0987,2.0482,0.0877,3.5846,5.0351,2.6067,2.9361,2.37,1.7627,3.8226,5.3134,0.487,4.5428,0.8712,4.0817,0.8466,4.7312,0.6178,3.3638,0.4583,4.4458,5.8794,2.9322]}

It was a great read as well, as I'm already really enjoying the one in front of me.\nYou should catch the full episode by clicking the link to the right, or you can use the links here for the rest (I guess I will do both instead of the article).\nOn all hands.\nA fun evening with my hubby. :)\nI took my son for a walk around 8:30 PM - he did not care for the weather, and he was the only one in the family to make it. Our little guy was up, but he didn't even really need to get up. When he got home we took the dog for a swim, and there was a huge buzz of joy on his shoulders as he said \"Hi dad!\" Then I decided to check out some of the other places in town. Since we only needed to go to the gym for about an hour (which I'm sure didn't need to be a ton of work), I figured it was worth getting to take in a little bit more of the local stuff as well too!","token_len":342,"entropy":[9.1178,12.6624,9.188,8.6324,8.2664,10.3831,1.5837,8.8335,4.927,3.0832,1.5892,3.926,2.2181,5.854,0.1809,2.8645,5.0231,5.2532,3.6755,1.5285,0.834,5.758,5.6811,1.7821,6.2606,3.4096,6.133,0.0013,3.2907,2.4907,2.4083,4.6472,0.0003,4.2009,1.7294,0.4415,1.9005,0.6976,4.4184,4.1547,0.8904,2.914,3.4042,1.4455,2.1159,5.7382,1.5285,2.2589,3.7076,4.2942,4.3574,2.7818,3.4999,2.7045,4.9615,2.1147,1.0407,0.1564,0.3646,5.3285,2.1354,3.459,2.182,2.7515,6.4362,1.4929,0.6876,3.6906,1.5808,5.0035,2.8789,2.459,1.9917,4.9531,0.1238,1.0119,2.298,3.5931,3.1323,6.1239,2.0225,2.7799,3.9879,2.4677,2.541,2.8452,5.3773,4.9261,3.2872,3.1819,1.9722,0.725,1.5008,4.2603,2.7233,2.6334,0.0084,0.0477,1.2435,6.0661,7.6229,6.9463,0.0299,2.5494,1.4891,1.8605,4.7114,2.6814,1.5065,5.1224,3.5979,0.3335,1.1434,6.6136,4.4958,0.7522,1.0886,2.3316,1.0952,3.5181,5.5028,4.8684,1.0188,2.9812,1.8876,1.3966,2.6488,1.2498,5.0571,0.6252,1.1759,2.9059,1.3829,2.9815,5.4803,5.0871,1.247,1.4228,6.3585,3.9489,4.8128,0.0187,0.0537,0.7448,0.9133,4.5771,4.5062,5.8516,1.9062,4.6904,3.6327,4.3303,1.6358,2.1462,0.881,3.3786,0.7253,1.748,2.3367,1.5267,2.4212,0.1003,5.7892,0.6743,3.0807,4.1378,3.3589,2.1952,2.9902,5.2172,3.1045,5.619,1.4998,4.3965,3.7638,4.118,6.4348,0.5528,1.554,7.0332,1.7901,0.7825,5.2393,6.6332,7.3254,5.5955,1.2421,4.7817,7.2396,5.0739,3.4199,2.0914,8.6277,0.0204,1.553,5.8336,0.775,2.9118,6.452,2.5503,4.8123,3.5871,0.2818,1.1936,3.1123,9.3537,0.7415,0.5576,3.5231,6.1594,3.7105,4.8631,2.1456,5.6063,2.0001,1.4772,5.049,1.4282,1.9453,1.9901,1.5918,5.2725,0.9157,0.23,2.6115,0.5775,3.5073,1.8884,3.8544,1.6011,1.8662,6.1672,3.1991,4.317,1.4124,5.6967,4.3574,3.6055,1.4793,2.2109,0.0009,3.4001,5.1274,4.1437,0.7519,3.4124,1.1765,1.4453,4.812,0.9363,1.6462,1.3539,4.8854,3.545,2.8564,3.8549,2.0669,0.1413,5.5488,1.2679,0.7227,4.7895,1.0364,1.2562,3.3678,4.8717,3.727,4.2586,3.9742,2.352,4.9265,2.0268,0.3888,5.7933,1.4414,4.007,5.5403,1.8096,4.9681,2.4888,4.9779,0.356,3.8365,1.1188,3.1319,1.0969,0.6391,1.2974,4.7407,3.2183,1.3191,1.4253,6.8404,2.2327,4.3377,5.1542,1.0107,2.1238,0.9939,1.5043,5.4795,2.2855,2.0724,1.8709,0.0018,3.3304,2.3548,1.8398,3.298,1.4402,6.3362,0.0002,5.3709,0.5387,0.3197,2.6429,6.4317,0.3228,2.6139,0.9496,0.5951,3.4877,1.7605,1.1538,2.2176,3.9318,2.3311,4.2286,3.7741,1.3621,1.5722,1.6768,1.7906,0.8543,0.4799,3.7443,4.0983,3.2023,0.1661,8.0819,3.0679]}
{"id":2597,"ended":false,"length":316,"text":"A lifelong cannibal has his first vegetarian meal, and then cuts the meat off afterward.\nIn Canada a vegetarian meal is \"porkless\" (i.e. meat is not frozen off). It's pretty disgusting.\nThey only used \"frozen\" (i.e. frozen) because the animal was too tasty for the meat to be cooked. It wasn't frozen, though.\nNope. It's frozen and kept up to temperature and temperature isn't frozen. That being said, there's only two things to freeze: meat and vegetable (i.e. cheese).\nSo the meat isn't frozen?\nThe only meat to freeze to is cheese.  Or you can just add a bit of liquid cheese, which gets really hard to get in a restaurant.\nSo you're telling me cheese is frozen?\nThe cheese is cooked in a freezer, and kept frozen. The pork is wrapped in cardboard.  I would put an extra glass or two of ice in there so you can eat it first.\nThe reason that meat isn't frozen is because you don't want meat being eaten without frozen meat.\nThat's what I'm saying, but yeah. I'd really like to get a freezer that would let me keep my frozen meat at home, although at the same time that I could eat my cold food while freezing it.\nIf you're able to use freeze-a-thon for most things, it may just be the right thing to do.  (As an example, I can eat any frozen hamburger I want from Taco Bell and the meat is still frozen, just in case I need to cook my first veggie dinner too.)","token_len":343,"entropy":[11.7543,12.2912,4.3836,4.985,5.0345,9.4092,0.9327,1.9568,1.6031,3.341,7.0092,2.8264,0.7669,1.526,7.5152,0.6235,1.4574,11.4897,6.6812,5.6555,1.9945,4.2003,0.6609,4.7887,5.3254,1.3772,7.9253,1.2805,2.267,3.5448,0.0011,0.0003,0.935,2.9892,2.8228,1.6984,5.2132,7.5093,2.2682,2.9676,1.4073,5.73,5.0769,1.2541,1.1354,6.1128,5.602,6.4002,4.0026,4.4037,0.578,0.3648,4.0246,1.3531,0.0007,0.0015,0.027,2.2284,1.373,4.5108,2.4755,4.4692,1.6252,2.8227,6.649,2.0186,1.8049,2.4409,1.6813,1.1881,1.9392,1.086,3.3631,3.8773,0.0007,3.768,1.9998,3.5954,0.9777,0.9832,6.8369,2.5561,0.8353,2.7457,0.9812,4.5152,3.4908,5.4142,5.885,1.4424,5.8672,3.5297,3.0049,5.7633,0.0005,5.9606,0.7425,4.3142,4.8156,0.0149,0.1819,3.4381,1.5518,4.6374,3.5779,2.4311,2.7586,5.7071,1.3907,2.4862,0.5071,4.5534,2.927,2.2754,0.0008,0.001,0.0361,5.1772,1.4953,0.7,3.008,3.3139,2.3411,4.281,0.0015,1.2339,3.9626,1.6638,3.2514,2.9089,3.4162,2.6298,2.0479,5.7801,1.168,3.5888,0.5596,6.861,11.9314,4.429,1.1213,2.4946,4.6653,2.3234,2.3368,0.4633,4.3935,3.9934,2.6322,2.6562,5.2517,5.2812,3.554,0.658,2.4045,3.1644,3.0669,4.7721,0.7145,0.6982,2.8259,3.1343,2.1655,5.9061,0.183,4.6558,0.6882,4.0011,0.9959,0.7113,3.2489,3.1658,0.9713,5.3823,2.02,0.9252,4.3772,1.744,1.8072,5.1457,4.0482,0.9861,2.8446,7.6694,0.952,6.4255,0.3646,5.404,2.1269,3.1098,3.4641,4.5434,5.3253,4.8007,1.8487,6.6619,3.4417,0.5448,0.9279,2.8063,1.5011,1.6114,3.2486,2.7774,0.8802,3.89,0.6462,6.1106,0.7374,0.5605,2.7952,6.0182,2.9352,2.7654,3.0802,0.0003,0.1547,0.4335,0.3302,3.1674,2.0492,0.0011,1.2018,4.2068,5.2859,2.8607,4.672,5.3975,0.9336,0.4176,1.3549,4.0427,0.5653,3.1118,1.5446,1.5137,0.97,2.2627,1.9963,7.0333,2.0281,2.2846,2.941,4.5611,0.8972,0.3496,3.078,1.7585,4.2422,2.8599,3.4701,3.0913,1.293,3.1973,1.7499,3.3812,0.7473,4.5873,2.9651,2.0725,5.3484,4.815,1.6705,2.0408,0.0138,4.1287,1.301,2.5943,2.2786,2.226,6.2994,3.6693,3.9645,4.6755,0.5745,0.7458,0.6007,3.3528,0.7227,1.4944,5.9257,0.222,4.2834,6.0164,1.3609,6.0075,0.0427,2.1028,0.6075,3.2666,6.802,1.8726,0.445,2.7139,4.3448,4.2044,0.7134,1.6645,2.0762,1.4544,0.3883,0.2403,0.3175,3.5032,5.6301,5.4548,3.2769,2.9344,0.253,1.1407,3.6731,3.5715,5.6403,2.4905,5.0482,0.0168,2.5713,0.5102,4.2407,6.9099,0.0331,2.5229,3.9718,4.3585,1.7455,2.6126,1.2616,1.745,4.1805,2.2669,0.5202,1.6564,1.4585,0.6915,3.6644,3.4054,4.8153,5.1532,0.0803,4.7917,5.516,0.6278]}

They had worked at the library the whole time and had come in in the evenings to use the computers and play games.\n\nThe kids also had an occasional talk about what they wanted to do. As for what they had for supper, they had some meat to eat. He said it was always the meat he grew and the rest was made up of things like onion paste, dried spinach and cornbread.\n\nIn addition to that, he said, they had plenty of other things to look at. He told them that there's a lot going on in the country about schools and roads and airplanes, but also that they could talk to each other about anything else. He said that the school district always asked him about a certain school the kids said were near their home. He said that most were the same school and that they'd be happy to go there once they had some money too.","token_len":344,"entropy":[7.2698,2.922,7.6692,1.9656,1.6595,3.0089,8.4386,6.4176,6.0907,5.4778,3.8603,7.582,3.6974,3.8504,2.6385,3.5372,5.4448,5.2527,2.1675,3.0707,3.1723,4.194,7.3445,6.4089,5.0543,1.6412,6.6104,1.8636,5.3233,3.0669,4.1376,1.7054,5.828,4.5848,0.4089,4.6874,3.9604,4.3125,5.8825,5.2729,0.9277,1.9066,2.2143,5.5033,5.9249,1.3949,2.4941,4.7946,6.2208,0.4083,3.7428,1.7372,1.6495,2.7994,6.583,0.7996,2.1549,1.245,4.5021,1.875,1.3267,3.4677,4.5167,6.0042,7.9704,1.1336,2.0708,0.5349,1.1265,3.1403,5.3864,2.7933,1.523,3.6799,4.222,4.4833,0.8356,1.116,2.3983,0.7692,3.7884,8.6728,2.0027,4.7699,2.2703,2.5104,2.2069,4.1465,4.1857,0.2858,3.8712,3.2457,5.5879,5.0343,1.8289,0.6633,2.4441,3.3771,0.4184,0.7414,1.6452,1.0533,1.8976,1.4317,0.8379,1.97,0.6065,2.7402,1.2816,0.6347,0.0925,4.5909,1.1985,0.6621,1.144,3.7908,0.907,3.3917,0.0285,2.8955,4.8354,3.1549,2.5977,3.6696,1.9488,0.3889,2.4134,5.0456,0.6816,4.2011,4.4578,2.4185,4.7451,3.4112,0.9828,1.0957,3.2722,2.1403,1.3325,3.8683,1.7468,1.0865,5.2618,1.402,5.1744,5.1437,3.3505,1.3946,9.1713,4.2267,1.1168,1.7155,3.8099,2.7022,4.2267,4.2745,5.1954,4.0039,1.4687,8.2434,2.5745,3.056,0.8026,2.8997,2.4133,5.865,3.3601,1.074,4.3829,3.9088,2.5961,1.2803,2.2152,1.7689,4.2097,3.1534,4.8671,0.7964,3.7926,1.3686,6.0335,0.3927,4.747,1.9712,3.8865,1.9406,0.6679,2.25,0.0002,2.3096,1.7924,4.2115,2.0109,3.5871,4.6985,3.5037,0.7134,3.3198,1.2087,2.3445,0.2969,0.3784,1.9971,5.1887,2.4631,2.3606,0.5997,3.7039,4.3321,3.4466,0.4888,1.3306,2.1734,3.567,6.2319,3.2753,0.7665,1.4568,3.1415,0.7141,2.8511,0.4476,4.5866,2.5696,5.0546,4.6516,6.1333,4.9467,3.3684,5.829,3.1183,3.7532,2.284,0.9273,4.7023,2.5025,5.1908,6.4807,0.8349,5.3411,5.5108,1.4667,5.2469,3.581,0.5212,1.4192,0.0002,4.306,2.8955,0.3652,3.6869,0.2401,1.3112,0.5899,0.5738,1.6494,0.9744,5.2822,0.0543,2.9345,0.5965,1.1423,4.9477,3.8402,0.8908,1.3888,4.5498,0.5431,2.1974,3.5284,3.3695,0.9341,2.6148,3.0302,0.0172,1.0231,0.8693,3.3443,4.3482,7.3466,1.3436,5.6704,0.9627,7.2562,1.6202,2.6429,3.5261,1.5352,2.4901,3.1356,3.0159,1.9741,4.0642,0.0074,0.5325,3.5254,3.9496,0.9705,1.4672,0.5661,1.4945,2.4546,3.7456,2.9565,5.0867,4.0417,1.1163,2.5538,4.2857,3.0301,3.523,5.9472,1.4721,5.4944,3.7285,4.654,2.6634,1.668,0.8308,1.2931,0.4592,1.0121,5.2028,3.8991,5.0822,0.8368,3.086,3.2789,1.1091,1.7724,2.7006,3.1868,3.0629,0.1733,3.4375,2.0803,4.7929,0.6937,2.6391,2.7952,3.3746,8.0234,0.1748]}

Jump into the sky, pick up a car, get a ride home, or just chill out on your couch, if you're an introvert. But there are plenty of ways around this. We've got the best way to solve the issue: Just grab your phone, flip it around, hold back on texting, and let your mind wander if you'd rather not focus on your phone.\n\nIf you're a guy who only hangs out with men (i.e. the occasional good sex act), there are plenty of ways to navigate. There's not as much stuff for guys to do as there is for guys to do, which is really the whole point of jumping in.\n\n1) Get your own phone. If you do choose that, it'll probably be one of those \"I'm going to go to dinner with my sister today and we'll hang out with this guy\" type of phones or ear buds.\n\n2) Buy a GPS. Most GPS devices are built for outdoor riding, and usually support a high frequency frequency band.\n\n3) Watch movie in real time. Most movies (i.e. movies filmed in real time) take place in the background, with no audio. This makes watching videos and other activities fun and immersive.\n\n5) Use Bluetooth for your phone. You can turn on Bluetooth 5 to allow you to make your phone play the music in between a game or video.\n\nThere are certainly many other ways to navigate the world, and there are tons of ways to find this out.

I have been a good friend, a good friend, a great friend, a good family, a great lover, a wonderful wife, a good husband, a great mother, a wife so many different people could all be called on for strength, courage, love and kindness in everything and I will be one of them.\n\nIf by all means you are feeling strongly about friendship then you are probably feeling inspired.\n\nSo the way you tell yourself about friendships is that each time you are together because everything is good and everything is normal. This will have an effect on you in other words and it will leave you feeling less alone with the whole situation. And it will always leave you feeling happy and in constant contact with your friends and that is very satisfying to you both.\n\nBut what if you are thinking about friends also? What if we are saying that the friendship between a good person, or good friend is good for everyone? Then maybe that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking about?\n\nYou know that you are saying this, you feel inspired. And as long as you keep thinking about this, you will keep going and it will take you back to the same place that you were. To this place that you want to go.

Also, \"paint\" refers to the image on the canvas of a person, and not simply \"paint.\" Unless you're a professional liar who likes painting, then it must seem that way.\nThe painting and the image on the canvas.  If not, it really only proves you're wrong on a certain level.\nI can say with certain certainty that painting *is* always a more realistic version of a dream. If you can actually understand how it feels like, painting is objectively better.\nWhat?

{"id":880,"ended":false,"length":325,"text":"SatChat : What do you do in your writing that you feel is unique?\nI write on the spur of the moment. I write a journal to help me find, document and remember my ideas, while being a writer. This also helps me out with the process of finding and writing. I have a tendency to be an introvert, so I try to not do too much to be a writer, and enjoy meeting new people.\n\nWhat are some of the different kinds of writing that you use?\n\nWriting is one of my favorite hobby! My writing career started at 17 years old and had never held a job that I had the capability of writing. Once I started writing on the spur of the moment, I learned to be an introvert, a creative artist, and a really positive personality. I also learned that when you are doing something that you dream of, you can\u2019t help but have a passion for that. When I started working on my first novel I was so intimidated by that initial thought, especially thinking about my own dreams or dreams of being a writer, that I would not give much thought to it. I took my time and tried to make it work, but I was afraid, that my dreams will not reflect well on me. I also learned to listen more to how people are expressing their emotions.

To even remember why you want to go to Hogwarts.  As much as I think you've got a good point.

Not all drivers love having extra time for themselves. I work for a real company and I\u2019m still quite certain that one driver will always be just the one, regardless of whether you make as much money or as little money as their day-to-day driver.\n\nThe worst part is that it\u2019s probably even more terrifying that your Uber driver will get a hint that this could be your only Uber driver. If you want to drive to work, at home, at your favorite restaurant, then a driver will be the first to admit that you\u2019re not sure why the cab driver is driving.\n\nHow much more horrible can you get for that too?","token_len":352,"entropy":[2.5709,5.3261,4.5679,9.8569,2.3073,4.3951,7.0402,0.8595,5.4851,3.6958,0.3581,1.4545,0.2408,4.1922,3.017,5.394,2.8855,1.5596,2.0342,2.0829,3.8573,0.3746,0.7002,0.1441,2.3508,1.1402,4.4775,1.0964,5.9614,4.2955,1.2432,4.1113,0.8824,3.16,3.2663,3.1055,1.5958,4.9305,0.6062,3.0505,1.2063,4.1081,6.3912,0.9509,18.4462,7.9754,3.6169,1.9041,6.1833,2.2599,1.6793,5.3091,1.0431,0.3277,6.2985,0.1931,1.5244,5.3893,7.2999,0.7755,3.9711,1.1433,7.2148,3.2419,1.2131,0.5754,3.4897,4.4469,1.6691,1.679,2.2694,0.0279,2.5505,4.9518,2.9205,5.0011,2.718,3.3775,1.9307,4.7207,3.4065,1.2945,0.2531,1.148,1.2178,2.0073,1.8674,2.3442,0.1968,0.0435,4.3798,3.2611,1.3145,6.1313,2.8945,2.3891,0.452,2.5875,0.0173,2.0056,4.8723,2.7489,0.9936,0.0195,3.7084,4.0267,3.3939,4.0404,1.3289,0.1693,5.8396,0.8619,2.636,4.419,1.3835,0.2611,0.0717,2.8276,2.4952,2.7884,4.7719,0.6753,2.7351,0.0183,0.4661,5.0202,2.4034,3.3707,1.4591,4.3459,1.8994,1.6803,5.1802,0.0787,0.0118,0.0017,4.6143,0.3965,6.1295,0.1004,1.5733,4.1682,3.0179,0.7452,2.067,5.4922,4.1862,0.5184,0.0271,3.795,0.634,1.0478,0.0003,5.3347,2.6776,3.4176,1.4503,2.6013,3.7856,4.9142,6.055,0.3961,4.9239,1.4008,0.0774,0.9206,3.3128,5.7375,4.0888,1.572,0.9486,0.0038,4.2255,2.3886,5.7982,4.6875,2.2162,0.1835,1.4835,3.2203,1.886,2.5399,2.8986,1.3842,1.0038,2.4215,2.6248,2.6202,0.0316,1.3601,2.4861,4.4195,2.5634,2.0525,0.333,1.4698,1.5955,0.3678,0.0794,0.0055,2.3143,2.1321,0.2792,6.1089,3.5101,5.7386,3.874,0.8083,2.5117,1.0233,1.5116,0.1887,5.9262,3.1954,0.7634,5.2608,4.6172,4.1781,2.9497,3.7872,1.8497,1.7754,3.8697,6.8669,2.5578,0.8529,5.0697,1.9561,2.1528,1.3636,3.5099,0.0658,0.9875,4.8743,5.1303,5.9705,0.4314,4.9543,2.168,1.7203,2.1889,1.8892,5.8737,5.4187,3.2271,4.2058,4.3256,0.1196,2.4795,2.164,5.0213,7.0303,0.2045,0.486,2.0798,2.0354,0.0466,1.0163,0.4659,7.3329,7.1463,2.6651,0.114,0.0009,0.0005,2.9667,0.7173,0.8889,0.0002,3.3496,4.6415,0.528,1.1498,0.3385,2.3253,3.1379,0.0717,0.3709,4.468,4.1237,1.336,4.3558,1.5521,3.0329,1.4323,0.1069,1.8498,5.3348,3.1607,6.6366,0.9233,4.115,4.6201,1.1265,2.182,4.3381,7.1088,3.4193,1.85,2.7033,0.7265,2.9677,0.2666,2.8913,3.109,0.3309,0.779,4.9497,2.4224,0.2891,2.0002,2.2905,2.7093,1.7058,0.3351,4.7987,5.2756,1.4603,1.861,2.8441,3.4344,2.8387,0.7576,6.1139,0.4765,0.9136,3.6748,0.0792,2.1904,1.6377,4.3466,3.0181,4.6132,5.3177,0.8347,1.2063,3.6485,2.2369,1.6461,0.0002,5.0863,3.3947,2.2514,5.6664,2.1703,2.4823,2.3085,3.0251,3.6219,7.3473,0.3407]}
{"id":950,"ended":true,"length":316,"text":"An interspecies couple copes with a failing relationship... [Katherine]\n\nI\u2019m a writer, artist and freelance writer, and have spent considerable time working on a collection of short stories in various languages, many of which have since been adapted to film \u2013 including Spanish film I Can Talk; the award-winning film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and the forthcoming bilingual adaptation of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\n\nI started my writing career in 1995, when I first published my novel, Unforgettable. I was then hired as a freelance writer for The Los Angeles Times, where I won and was a finalist for its 2003 Pulitzer Prize. After several years of writing in other languages and various languages \u2014 including Chinese, English, French, Italian and Japanese \u2014 I have decided to take a further step forward in the project by re-working my own story, which I intend to release this year.\n\nMy story also includes an unpublished book that I have been working on for over 25 years or so.\n\nThe first book I work on in Mandarin is the long-awaited sequel, Unforgettable. Written in early October 2016, this is a sequel to the acclaimed 2011 release I\u2019ll Never Forget\u2014my own biography.

The film also reflects both the lives of the characters and the struggles the female protagonist encounters in this one.\n\nThe story of the woman and the other protagonist in Unforgettable is also written in Mandarin, but it also shares the many themes of the book.","token_len":352,"entropy":[8.5453,4.2537,6.853,10.386,4.3135,0.6783,2.612,8.9146,2.339,7.1439,5.2459,7.9394,4.7877,2.9302,2.5853,0.0028,4.1189,13.5125,10.8765,2.8169,3.004,7.9323,1.608,4.4064,1.642,7.5272,1.0606,2.0214,1.5861,4.6835,3.7544,6.8821,0.1565,2.1935,0.9925,2.7012,4.4328,0.0648,2.4313,0.2199,3.7875,3.0269,3.327,1.8385,4.7178,0.3437,0.5703,1.4838,5.1769,0.4425,2.8883,2.2936,4.2875,7.7625,2.5298,6.9312,6.8058,5.8612,4.318,5.2398,6.9008,3.6867,4.8933,0.2145,0.0139,4.1831,2.6202,4.9355,2.4507,0.1386,0.1998,0.01,0.0013,1.5777,2.2022,1.1877,4.2539,8.218,3.7006,0.2207,6.0933,0.115,0.1839,0.0396,0.9928,0.0007,0.606,1.4852,0.0003,1.4364,3.8338,2.642,1.5379,0.0552,1.0819,3.9949,1.4614,1.1601,0.233,3.8974,3.3951,1.7338,3.3185,1.609,5.6449,2.8944,0.4421,2.3851,1.5339,2.3352,3.5469,4.821,1.371,0.4954,1.695,0.5051,1.8815,3.3686,5.3775,0.0431,0.0768,1.4577,1.6717,0.1622,4.5677,6.642,2.1617,3.1321,4.9366,0.0039,0.4022,6.4726,5.9794,3.2428,0.0614,0.5943,3.4084,4.5509,0.7963,1.2644,1.5785,3.0927,4.1149,0.9765,2.5199,5.4457,3.7046,6.9264,1.004,4.8557,0.4444,3.1254,0.2091,1.433,0.247,1.6499,1.9462,2.3345,0.1818,0.1637,3.7636,3.4988,0.1529,3.0836,1.1854,6.0632,1.5552,2.175,1.9238,2.5116,6.0349,2.2866,4.8362,0.3065,4.2755,1.9062,2.5573,3.1701,2.0778,2.4014,1.4631,4.732,0.053,4.0126,2.6019,0.9433,0.9174,0.6555,0.0002,2.9596,1.9323,6.2086,1.9423,2.2242,6.1758,4.1453,3.4312,0.7613,1.9509,1.6384,1.046,0.0125,1.0102,2.4894,4.6943,0.008,7.5496,0.643,0.7813,2.0354,0.0003,2.6801,3.7048,2.3784,1.6244,6.4106,0.0292,3.4632,7.4059,0.347,2.494,5.7131,0.5041,0.4872,4.6164,1.951,2.9084,0.1407,0.0013,1.3795,5.7243,1.8462,5.3048,4.9391,3.1139,0.3194,2.7815,1.6624,0.9392,4.9977,0.2203,1.1612,5.3262,4.1915,6.471,3.3231,8.5512,0.0794,5.5309,3.613,1.602,6.9584,5.7474,4.3416,6.4125,3.5006,5.7711,3.8265,9.9098,0.8019,0.6157,3.4977,2.5876,3.3467,1.2738,2.6262,0.6938,2.5478,2.6576,7.2455,1.9513,0.3546,0.3557,0.0002,3.4695,0.0131,0.0017,2.5727,6.6073,1.0082,3.0587,0.7157,5.0027,0.1992,5.6526,4.0751,2.77,6.5957,1.644,1.5514,5.9991,4.4037,1.8802,1.664,3.0971,0.1576,1.6439,0.7714,2.4055,3.9981,4.5288,5.572,4.2888,1.1758,5.8818,0.251,1.3278,1.444,0.7772,0.6114,2.7454,4.4966,5.4388,2.8187,4.7276,1.7105,3.6584,5.6113,1.5138,0.485,0.0002,1.8979,2.4592,2.9904,1.2029,3.5978,2.5541,0.9441,3.2008,4.0536,3.0364,0.9975,0.0014,0.0183,1.0983,3.6281,4.2178,1.8385,1.5315,1.2585,2.554,2.0858,3.2904,4.9923,2.1917,6.1319,4.0,0.7314,1.5977,2.2603,1.154]}

{"id":3570,"ended":true,"length":342,"text":"A toy boat floats out to sea and has an adventure... [Katherine]\n\nI'm sure he'll be fine -- \"We all know what happened.\" -- He didn't have a dog, either.\n\nSo, let's talk about \"A Boat of a Lifetime\" for those of you who remember the original story we got on the radio: a \"doggy boat\" float around the world and make friends with the people who like to fish on and use it. And while it was \"a great\" fishing adventure, it also got us into an amusement park. The story begins that of The Kid in the Blue Sea, a young sailor on his way to a friend's house in Florida who has become a fan of a toy boat. The kid asks a \"friend\" to bring his new friends, but is not willing or able to do so because he's afraid that the friend will turn him into a monster.\n\nA fun story about \"The Kid in the Blue Sea.\"\n\nIn the end, The Kid is a monster, sure, but it also became his own creation.

(WKOW 23 News)\nThe 21-year-old Brown came to the University of Wisconsin to learn English. He was looking to get into a new school. He and a group of seniors and freshmen started playing soccer while they were at home.\nIt started out pretty good. When the team won the 2010 American Athletic Conference championship, there were problems with their Spanish and English proficiency. But they all got better.\n\"Every single time I think back to a soccer game, we've really pushed each other to make the best out of our times together,\" Brown said.\n\"The last time we played against North Carolina in a U.S. Open tournament -- in 2012, I won $20,000 by winning with a penalty shot,\" teammate, Jacob Miller added.\nThe game was over. But the Wiscans didn\u2019t give up without a fight.\n\"I just want them to be proud that we won as well,\" Brown said. \"I would love to see my friends or my family here in the United States, that I could play soccer and just be right there for my dad and my sister...

That means loss for you, as well. And loss for the rest of us. Your loss is that loss that will turn you into everything else you will be. That loss to love and loss for the rest of us goes on, as a woman who has lost her sense of what she truly feels. It\u2019s like that in many couples\u2014that is, that is, in many situations. It\u2019s very difficult to reconcile those feelings. I would say that we lose a lot of this in these relationships. I know that for our partners, it\u2019s not uncommon to find ourselves in love, but in relationships without love, it\u2019s just plain unacceptable. And that\u2019s where things need to get better. When people don\u2019t understand that you take your time and love them, that\u2019s when we end up losing them. That\u2019s when we\u2019re really losing them. You can turn away and say, \u2018Yeah, I love you\u2014you know who I am.\u2019 And it\u2019s in your power to change the way you live and how you live.\u201d\n\nA New Way to Live was written and made available on Kickstarter.","token_len":354,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,2.0279,6.7248,1.597,3.3138,2.7656,7.5549,5.9846,2.8373,0.1032,1.1105,9.3795,0.3679,0.1364,0.0343,0.5448,0.0038,0.0329,0.0024,4.914,0.0865,0.0056,0.0011,0.0084,3.775,1.0313,0.3927,0.0966,0.5599,0.0181,0.0992,0.01,1.5771,0.097,0.0038,0.0006,0.0093,2.39,0.0355,0.0102,0.0014,0.0013,0.0006,0.005,0.0012,0.2792,0.0104,0.0005,0.0008,7.9441,0.0002,5.4679,6.3976,3.4052,4.2455,4.0004,1.4333,2.9273,2.3349,4.8057,4.8058,6.0231,2.9474,1.7286,5.8406,0.7623,5.5569,4.3107,5.8246,2.0726,0.5886,0.0002,11.909,8.3465,4.422,2.4325,3.6441,0.1171,0.1219,0.0114,0.3462,5.384,5.1825,3.8877,2.5747,6.5115,3.4927,0.5519,5.0951,5.5733,2.894,2.4717,2.4492,2.0608,3.1839,1.6021,4.0366,1.6099,0.5107,4.7862,0.3326,0.3338,4.6675,3.8142,3.2625,5.9675,1.7435,1.6367,4.0971,0.4994,3.0629,3.1876,3.5989,1.5579,2.4663,1.5806,0.0163,0.8183,0.6515,4.7485,3.7559,1.2074,5.1544,3.4831,2.396,3.5932,6.309,0.9551,0.996,6.7451,3.9461,1.5118,5.3854,3.1897,0.7345,3.3083,2.1787,5.9523,3.0762,1.4803,3.7676,1.5774,2.3422,0.2452,0.003,0.3208,6.7169,2.1233,3.2903,3.5948,3.8226,8.0503,2.8665,1.726,0.613,1.0926,4.9715,0.0147,4.02,2.0201,3.4775,4.0373,0.8611,2.4145,16.9355,8.3079,1.1317,5.251,3.6565,4.275,5.071,6.1844,4.4537,3.2051,3.0189,0.5397,3.7056,4.3786,0.8088,2.6638,1.5831,4.3171,1.4777,2.2501,1.7337,0.1371,0.0187,5.433,1.4595,0.791,4.5521,3.6764,1.1428,1.7384,3.9613,3.9217,0.9891,1.1584,3.837,3.9645,2.2055,0.3284,0.4681,4.2682,3.5382,4.3861,2.8446,0.9188,2.9123,4.0134,1.0818,3.4208,5.7839,3.2922,1.0963,1.5909,1.4329,0.2815,0.0101,3.0883,3.5336,1.0988,2.9495,3.3229,1.6677,4.8496,2.0257,1.8824,2.772,3.637,5.7118,1.9621,0.9125,1.0644,0.5565,0.0096,0.0088,4.3546,4.6317,5.7908,0.2507,2.7583,1.962,1.9821,0.0313,0.2246,3.1104,4.3644,5.6093,0.0644,2.0901,1.2502,0.3667,5.0114,4.0012,3.3965,0.2796,3.2199,0.0138,2.3684,1.2502,4.0158,7.0285,2.727,4.7019,1.6131,4.3313,5.5818,1.05,2.6464,2.4786,0.0077,0.0277,1.3615,3.9,5.2967,0.1519,2.5701,2.3049,0.7937,2.5816,1.4512,0.003,0.0346,0.8233,0.6752,5.4948,0.0676,2.1576,4.2665,2.2179,1.5759,0.3503,4.1854,2.4247,5.5043,4.2918,2.8157,3.2725,0.5406,8.8978,6.7576,6.9351,0.2015,1.2603,3.1492,0.316,5.2749,2.8338,2.4761,5.2492,0.7731,0.4097,0.8795,3.0003,0.3578,2.4206,2.8385,0.9873,0.0125,0.0366,5.4686,1.5955,3.9605,0.1703,2.5289,3.1818,1.3617,0.457,3.3124,2.5236,2.5775,0.0541,1.6496,1.1909,3.284,6.6407,0.7661,0.0003,4.3166,3.0508,0.0907,0.0265,0.0263,5.1045,2.9418,2.5207,7.0076,1.4352,2.704,3.6538,1.8369]}

The move goes against the public policy that residents have been demanding for a \"new lease\" in the city's land use policy in order for the city mayor and his team to maintain service to both residents and business owners. The new lease, which would also include $20 million in financing for the city's historic South Slope redevelopment and $10 million for the Downtown and Downtown Downtown improvements, would effectively cut taxes, open up opportunities for development to take place in the city center, and give residents more access to real estate. ''In addition to this, residents will benefit from the new lease. At the same time, they will benefit from the fact that both the mayor and his team will get a lot of use from the new lease.'' ''The new lease will help the City improve the downtown and the Downtown revitalization,'' said David S., a former city government architect whose research focuses on the development and management of the East Slope.

Well, yeah. I'm usually really good at remembering things - there was no good old \"I can see you but a bear doesn't look right\" or whatever, but I don't know if that would've felt any different in games, though.   The game is more about the story, I guess. It just seemed weird, with the exception of my own, or at least that's how it seemed to work for some people.\nThat's the point!\nOh, I know exactly what you mean.

{"id":1205,"ended":true,"length":340,"text":"Your whole modern life is a lucid dream. Now you wake up into real life, the Middle Ages.\nI don't know what kind of lucid dreaming you mean, so I suppose \"real life\" doesn't apply, but good for you.\nIt means dreaming about things, like having fun, or being silly.  Like being on vacation, or spending the day outside, or not having the chance to exercise.  It doesn't mean nothing, but dreaming and experiencing new experiences make it different, and if nothing else, it keeps you healthy and refreshed for new experiences and learning new things.\nThanks for the comment, man.  My brain is so freaking strong these days because everything I do is lucid.  I just realized it really bugs me that I have to spend money to come off of something that really isn't \"real\" yet.\nYou'd be amazed at how many people get scared by thinking that their brain is \"real\".    The reason all of these people can be scared is that they're constantly dreaming, with something that isn't real, or that they have no motivation, to do it.  So you can expect them to wake up in a few years and wonder why you just want them to stop\nI wish I could sleep like that... But I won't.  It is weird because I don't do this at all, but I know I have a lot of other problems to deal with like being married... But anyway, I do dream when I'm very depressed.  I'm not at home much anymore so I can't sleep a lot.  It's been a long time since I've gotten into the habit of staying up late.\nThat's interesting.

So, I believe you are wrong, and you're wasting your time trying to make sense out of what you haven't understood yet and I'm sure you have plenty of other questions...\n\nI'm pretty sure you are going to be stuck on your answer for weeks or even months until you understand everything.\n\nYou're going to have to try really hard not to be angry or take it as a personal attack. Most people won't understand why you said \"It 'll be just like it was before. Trust me.''' and most people won't use that as a reason to hate. That's all I've ever known to you :)\n\nSo, I think you are wrong. Yes, I have seen some mistakes, but in general I prefer it if the person being talked to is me and that I can just \"accept the situation\" while standing in front of them. People always have an excuse to just ignore my advice or call my bluff, but there is always someone who is out there and cares about me and they will still get mad at me because I am not able to \"accept the situation\" with them.\n\nSo I don't think you are completely wrong about the situation.

It's the kind of story where the writer, having never bothered with it, wanted to make it as fun as possible. Sometimes it had to be something that got done the right way, and sometimes it wasn't.\n\nBut on the other side he wasn't making stories; he was making stories that were a lot of fun. He was a writer and a writer. He didn't want anyone to be ashamed or embarrassed that the characters had died in this story, and he cared about the community around them. That's all I've ever known about that person who passed away.\n\nI've seen people post on here about him being scared to tell others about his life and how the story he told would change them.\n\nI just want them to be sure that he will be remembered.\n\nAnd I also would like them to be sure that they take the time to tell another story that is more entertaining than this one, because when they write about their childhood, they really just aren't able to imagine what they would want their story to be.\n\nAnd that's the saddest part of the whole thing; having been dead for 20 years, and having been the victim of these crimes, and the people who have left you with such horrible memories and said things about your life so many years ago.","token_len":356,"entropy":[7.7741,5.2664,5.9693,3.2606,7.677,2.0551,0.8389,0.1209,2.345,6.098,5.754,3.7155,2.2603,1.8103,2.1451,2.0195,5.5629,3.8139,5.8926,6.1764,7.9583,4.1828,0.0368,0.2158,0.5298,6.4342,3.2195,3.3421,4.0751,1.0556,1.2435,7.0394,2.3388,4.3299,1.7143,3.5357,2.0327,5.8133,0.0014,3.3716,1.8187,4.5387,3.5099,2.1146,1.3502,1.5409,5.5518,3.3084,0.4674,1.3647,0.0062,4.0603,2.9175,1.0962,3.8852,0.8608,0.9446,4.7977,5.0804,5.6607,0.0206,3.0066,3.2881,3.2935,7.4667,4.6127,3.8408,0.8552,2.6838,1.9959,1.1298,0.0001,6.0779,1.9742,0.2902,1.75,10.2391,1.9338,4.5449,2.343,1.8358,1.2435,1.7097,2.9875,5.7261,2.7696,0.987,1.7315,2.8196,0.6516,3.8512,3.8152,0.008,0.7822,1.445,1.8692,1.5085,3.7654,1.8587,5.2588,6.9109,1.8611,2.7734,1.0229,6.0135,0.2471,2.5761,1.6415,2.5619,5.3106,0.3997,0.0711,1.1302,5.5593,1.5082,5.88,0.6061,0.4824,3.3783,1.3002,4.6465,3.9292,5.7378,3.9618,0.0111,1.1213,1.5532,1.0761,0.2366,3.0938,0.0002,0.59,1.4811,0.0001,3.711,5.0921,0.5513,0.2751,4.1742,7.7729,4.9643,0.0006,4.8699,4.8389,5.8807,0.2342,0.2132,1.5062,2.0284,1.8186,1.5189,4.1852,2.3008,2.1462,0.0549,0.946,2.2378,0.9406,4.0765,2.1091,2.7079,1.4933,1.8979,4.5006,1.3757,2.9608,0.0003,2.0441,5.0511,0.4986,2.4978,5.2967,3.2751,2.8526,3.5925,3.7761,3.6893,2.8264,0.5399,3.5827,3.4584,1.6111,1.6093,1.5704,1.1958,6.2983,0.7405,1.306,7.1645,4.7246,1.1159,0.5743,3.4118,0.7669,3.5863,3.7988,2.8649,1.4685,2.2299,0.5942,3.3464,5.2475,4.0132,6.4403,0.2022,0.6983,0.5173,0.0001,2.6836,2.6762,2.3348,2.2536,6.2886,2.4353,4.7142,1.7626,5.7008,2.4254,5.1011,1.969,2.0334,5.3515,1.0577,1.4199,2.8276,2.3508,2.0826,4.0685,1.797,2.9563,1.9681,3.8994,3.7338,3.873,0.774,2.0675,0.0002,1.8415,4.7321,2.7591,5.1103,0.0161,3.3142,4.8386,0.8291,2.6857,5.4254,1.9147,1.9903,1.9723,1.2262,0.0002,3.3146,1.9337,3.4544,5.8404,0.6091,2.086,0.0324,1.9001,0.8767,0.1557,2.4161,6.4083,2.3174,0.5765,0.1027,2.833,7.1068,0.3007,2.3055,2.0011,3.7755,4.8275,2.391,1.2594,0.3163,1.8748,1.912,4.4956,2.0161,3.6786,3.0594,3.6334,4.2329,1.2162,0.8373,4.2672,4.9055,5.5697,0.0009,4.6256,0.0042,3.6295,1.6091,1.4656,1.9876,4.5402,3.0011,2.6738,0.0318,0.1878,0.9591,0.6438,0.0001,2.7958,2.2416,0.4219,2.7888,6.4116,0.001,0.3767,1.1672,2.4877,0.7371,0.7996,3.5291,5.5949,3.5517,6.2349,0.3244,4.0587,0.2407,1.0077,1.7908,1.7554,2.005,4.0998,3.9826,0.1237,5.1837,4.3864,1.2092,1.3182,3.6711,3.1727,0.4177,2.0697,5.4636,3.1675,3.3293,3.4905,4.5577,0.4821,2.78,7.487,3.9939,1.8276,2.74,2.0564,5.234,3.3588,2.0395,0.5892,1.0027]}
{"id":212,"ended":true,"length":340,"text":"Your whole modern life is a lucid dream. Now you wake up into real life, the Middle Ages.\nI don't know what kind of lucid dreaming you mean, so I suppose \"real life\" doesn't apply, but good for you.\nIt means dreaming about things, like having fun, or being silly.  Like being on vacation, or spending the day outside, or not having the chance to exercise.  It doesn't mean nothing, but dreaming and experiencing new experiences make it different, and if nothing else, it keeps you healthy and refreshed for new experiences and learning new things.\nThanks for the comment, man.  My brain is so freaking strong these days because everything I do is lucid.  I just realized it really bugs me that I have to spend money to come off of something that really isn't \"real\" yet.\nYou'd be amazed at how many people get scared by thinking that their brain is \"real\".    The reason all of these people can be scared is that they're constantly dreaming, with something that isn't real, or that they have no motivation, to do it.  So you can expect them to wake up in a few years and wonder why you just want them to stop\nI wish I could sleep like that... But I won't.  It is weird because I don't do this at all, but I know I have a lot of other problems to deal with like being married... But anyway, I do dream when I'm very depressed.  I'm not at home much anymore so I can't sleep a lot.  It's been a long time since I've gotten into the habit of staying up late.\nThat's interesting. I think you're also different too.","token_len":356,"entropy":[7.1948,10.4613,1.5351,1.2066,2.7198,11.3066,0.5278,0.9598,5.3272,2.2103,4.8506,0.0586,6.9189,5.637,0.8829,1.852,4.0471,9.6831,1.3668,1.6706,2.0821,7.2971,3.1953,0.0007,1.1261,1.6195,4.6928,0.0015,4.252,1.5251,1.5393,5.4479,1.1837,4.989,0.7252,6.4729,6.8216,1.5975,0.4537,0.1024,3.1244,0.0008,3.742,3.7454,0.5275,7.7591,3.2255,0.4224,0.6185,0.922,3.7689,5.1567,4.7425,1.9364,2.1561,2.5433,3.6638,5.6864,4.139,1.0383,1.972,2.7388,5.5705,0.5751,6.7218,12.8907,4.2944,4.2974,4.0429,1.1992,0.6202,4.3479,3.5942,1.2945,4.0822,1.8153,0.2501,4.6425,1.7621,2.9405,3.9799,0.1413,5.6137,0.8513,1.3497,3.023,3.2238,0.0006,0.4785,6.5371,1.4643,1.2415,5.9663,5.1465,4.35,4.7362,2.7573,4.4615,1.9755,4.9437,2.5891,1.3649,5.0996,6.1388,0.422,0.5561,1.0213,4.9522,0.3083,6.0051,1.2904,5.4506,3.3735,5.7388,0.9889,3.5231,5.618,2.1038,0.3046,0.3661,0.7969,7.2219,0.7323,2.4875,4.707,1.1675,6.1229,0.5148,2.5411,5.522,4.0803,1.0704,2.9063,5.3441,4.5305,5.9426,0.0296,5.6072,5.1528,1.7749,1.0432,0.9925,3.9102,1.3494,1.2391,1.4177,3.4837,5.5651,3.0956,5.3588,6.7606,0.0211,1.6606,1.1803,2.7884,0.7345,3.5205,6.2158,1.9672,5.7078,6.5749,2.4222,5.4523,1.9827,4.2629,2.2786,0.0008,5.4416,0.3413,1.2575,4.8528,0.4605,1.5383,3.4609,5.5873,1.7528,2.3871,0.8947,0.2892,1.7589,0.8802,3.4817,5.893,2.5879,5.6438,1.5934,2.6722,2.1568,0.6346,2.8772,1.6392,1.8537,0.3884,5.0155,3.7487,4.2435,3.9068,6.2177,0.8897,2.0108,0.7993,4.3842,3.1972,3.0812,0.7371,2.0408,0.8126,2.1741,4.9162,3.8816,2.1524,5.494,6.3685,1.9461,2.7741,0.0004,0.602,1.8742,1.9449,2.2081,0.9979,3.3049,1.9247,6.7488,3.4151,4.2917,2.0728,1.8798,0.3421,0.3929,4.6537,2.9275,2.1538,5.8895,2.0987,0.0496,4.7914,0.0384,2.4225,1.5073,4.3262,4.1524,1.7962,4.9717,1.5607,3.1592,4.6316,3.9008,4.4501,0.0685,3.5257,8.9175,2.2218,4.8431,0.5453,0.5737,6.5329,3.2288,0.9799,5.0555,3.6419,1.0234,5.0986,0.0012,0.6862,0.6831,3.3992,3.8243,5.5921,3.3303,0.8697,2.3624,0.0008,4.4036,3.1419,3.8174,0.4492,1.5332,1.408,0.8954,3.3506,1.6314,2.7282,2.0558,1.6735,0.2254,3.1644,3.4281,3.1498,0.2423,0.0016,5.6705,3.5008,6.931,4.7983,4.8519,5.8241,0.2723,1.1361,3.8819,4.0767,4.2376,0.132,0.9333,5.6901,3.3649,1.3959,0.5426,1.431,2.6529,1.9984,4.7982,2.4411,3.8415,2.6301,3.6553,0.469,2.2037,0.291,2.2284,5.1048,0.2829,0.9109,0.5859,3.1432,0.6971,3.7801,1.1938,1.5969,0.1293,0.2151,0.105,1.1804,4.2389,3.8987,3.021,0.7644,0.1825,4.8938,0.925,1.179,2.6478,1.8229,4.6046,0.752,5.4445,0.8916,2.6602,2.7802,2.6088,1.2427,5.1036,7.4964,6.746,0.5853]}

Yes, I have seen some mistakes, but in general I prefer it if the person being talked to is me and that I can just \"accept the situation\" while standing in front of them.

{"id":1736,"ended":false,"length":336,"text":"Write about the most unlikely super hero, who their super villain would be, and a battle between them...\n\nThe book is a collection of 25 books, most of them written by Marvel fans, including a cover by the author of the comics.\nIt also contains a series of stories from the first issues of the graphic novel The Avengers & Superman, with the hope of releasing the follow-up on the issue on July 31, 2017.\nThe book deals with one of the very strangest and darkest super characters on the Marvel Marvel Universe, Cap. That means he's not only a superhero who only happens to be an Avengers member but also happens to be one whose last words are \"I love you\". His actions don't just turn people against him but make him his own worst enemy.\n\nThe super-villain Cap is also a member of the X-Men and is in many ways the worst human being that we can ever have, both emotionally and physically.\nWhat's even more striking about Cap's transformation is his inability to do anything about it. As Captain Marvel or Spider-Man, Cap doesn't even know what super-villain he is, how he could ever be one and that's where this book goes. His biggest weakness is his fear of danger.\n\nIt's also clear that he is afraid of dying. At the end of Avengers #2, he is on a plane with other super mutants and is forced to leave his house, but also takes charge of his personal life.\n\"It was the most challenging story that I've ever written,\" Cap says. \"To be the man that I am, that I'm the way I am and that I'm capable of dealing with all these situations, it was daunting.\"","token_len":356,"entropy":[6.0771,2.1302,5.7124,7.8375,7.5621,3.6833,3.6932,4.759,9.9325,5.7294,4.3499,3.639,1.5454,1.6353,1.2469,4.8445,7.0046,1.7649,1.533,5.2049,1.7707,0.0289,3.1777,5.7812,1.7132,2.3387,3.7457,0.0189,6.0569,3.5855,1.6501,4.9195,0.2112,1.0449,2.7113,0.6135,4.1902,3.8359,1.4459,3.4522,3.0102,5.5916,1.0227,3.5877,3.1971,1.5582,1.4788,4.7303,1.164,1.5645,16.3727,3.5456,1.8957,1.7942,4.851,0.0397,3.91,2.6072,1.2238,3.5949,3.9312,0.6406,1.0739,6.3304,0.1888,4.4278,2.3844,5.7367,8.4688,1.8166,3.4412,2.1756,6.6384,0.6525,5.3919,2.2529,5.7584,0.5968,0.0247,5.0895,2.1246,6.9901,4.2428,2.9496,4.213,1.1759,1.7805,0.1909,0.4616,10.997,2.3881,6.6679,0.1208,4.5374,0.3111,0.354,5.924,5.4817,0.0021,2.3763,4.9722,4.431,4.6614,3.6037,0.5945,1.5715,5.7473,0.1387,1.1991,7.3551,0.4571,6.088,5.143,1.955,0.9882,2.1527,2.3444,1.5812,4.2909,2.6319,5.24,3.2856,0.1473,0.6644,3.2857,4.8093,1.9539,2.5972,0.4733,5.6497,0.0064,0.4864,2.5465,5.492,6.5072,3.587,1.086,1.0487,1.8216,2.22,0.208,2.5996,5.1017,4.7314,4.968,0.0007,2.6264,5.3327,3.7614,1.785,1.0647,2.1595,3.8163,1.1097,5.4292,2.0464,4.0661,0.0276,0.5324,0.7721,0.0027,1.9609,5.0117,2.5127,0.8424,0.2118,6.8313,1.3195,3.0433,1.4945,3.2221,0.0049,0.5454,4.0931,0.0393,0.048,1.9897,2.1758,4.5758,3.6296,0.1039,1.0998,4.7299,5.3172,0.4633,3.4986,3.143,3.8604,2.8745,2.965,2.4886,5.4318,4.5923,0.0595,0.3304,0.1717,2.2286,19.2567,1.9433,3.8241,0.328,5.0205,0.8735,4.1035,1.353,4.8283,0.9247,2.5329,4.124,0.0224,4.827,0.4254,0.9639,0.7055,0.4862,3.9063,5.2311,2.9453,6.5123,3.9525,0.1213,0.0929,0.3272,1.9359,4.2885,0.0004,2.5668,2.17,1.1861,4.6174,2.2911,0.7187,0.7319,0.4899,0.4508,1.4763,4.0677,0.682,4.4043,2.7141,1.45,3.6021,2.9582,1.6219,1.1871,3.3167,3.7128,1.1852,4.9116,2.2362,4.1612,5.5864,2.5958,0.2904,1.1655,3.7339,0.4337,4.9733,1.0202,1.2362,0.0002,3.3792,0.4455,3.2117,4.415,0.5414,2.0553,2.498,3.8749,0.3812,4.9301,0.883,5.1323,1.3294,0.8128,0.0565,4.6531,0.9598,3.4181,0.4494,1.5594,2.742,5.2988,1.5778,1.9085,3.013,4.8821,1.8218,4.7235,1.8162,2.936,3.313,0.0851,4.0549,1.9275,3.985,2.9846,3.1704,5.8362,4.8282,7.5625,0.187,1.6181,4.5878,0.9145,1.0024,1.5976,12.0152,3.0326,1.987,2.8776,1.9731,5.5835,4.3495,3.3945,0.2551,0.4512,0.2275,1.0411,1.2268,4.3611,1.7052,1.0219,0.2288,4.7712,1.9441,3.5797,3.6698,1.0075,0.5913,0.2374,1.2079,2.3068,0.9475,1.9362,2.6781,5.2289,0.2681,0.2834,1.9896,1.1672,0.2843,1.0958,4.3272,0.1407,5.9687,0.0052,3.2806,2.0182,2.5143,1.3259,1.6835,0.9794,5.5562,1.6198]}

The first is the control group, the second are LARPers.\n\nThe second is the aggressors. They have no choice but to attack. The attack vector is large. It will take much longer than that to make the difference between the first group and their host. It will have a different effect for those of us who are on the defensive. The aggressors will lose their will and may feel that nothing good has happened and that their efforts have failed and they will feel embarrassed and that they have failed again. That means they won and we will move on.\n\nOur aim is to destroy ourselves.\n\nWe had the capability of killing ourselves several days before as well. Now to turn it around and try to live as if nothing happened at all. It is possible to live a good life and yet suffer from a sense of inadequacy and suffering. If we do not understand our limitations in life, we will turn our life around.\n\nIn any case I would like to emphasize that I do not think that Zombie Apocalypse is a failure.

'''`''>\n\n-\n\nJohn,\n\nIn terms of \"how to make a good life,''' I have two main points of reference for you, the first is that you \"feel like dying\"; i.e., dying every day. For me, not dying often means dying every day. It means dying every day, in some sense, when my mind is still open, if my body is not active, if it is not breathing... and only when I am done. When I lose control, i.e., when I am not in control because everything else is going as though nothing happened to them... then what do you do? You kill, you leave. If we are really dead, what are we to do when we are reborn?\n\n\" \" If you do not understand, can you not understand? How do you know what you want to do? What do you need to do? How do you know that you can achieve what you want?\"\n\nThe second point and I think in general terms you are right, how do we know what to do exactly when everything goes wrong. My heart went out to your family in the Middle East. I had their family home torn apart before it could take its last chance at life, and I know they wanted to remain home because they wanted a decent life.

{"id":3101,"ended":true,"length":339,"text":"Socrates and Plato's souls are reborn as a pair of thoughtful rednecks.' - P.C. Lewis\n\nTuesday, October 13, 2002 04:05 PM\n\nBy John S. Lister, Jr.\n\nSome time out of the ordinary, an acquaintance of mine (a former colleague of mine) of the late Plato gave up running and moved on. And after a year, he finally got back around to doing something more.\n\nAt one point, I decided and I remember, once, that I wanted to run and learn as a teacher. And so I said, \"I want to run,\" but there were two things that were bothering me: The first was that I realized that I could't make it as a teacher, at least at this point. I thought a good part of the reason for that was because I was in the field, too, and that I was in the field of a profession which would have been more than enough. But I realized that I could do better, with a little bit of luck, or at least learn what I want to and work for it.\n\nSo I walked toward my home and picked me up; I got to the school, I went home. I walked back to my house. I went back to my apartment. I walked back to my office. And so, that was the beginning of this profession, right? That was the beginning of this profession. And I think that what I want to do as a teacher is continue to grow and expand and teach the students, who are coming to the next level.\n\nThat would be a great change for the profession. There have been so many changes in this profession, in ways that you could have never made it so many years ago.","token_len":359,"entropy":[12.1194,3.1699,3.4513,3.4896,11.54,2.6275,7.7604,2.6082,3.226,5.6431,0.6493,10.7796,7.5603,5.3122,0.0018,8.7718,5.1748,5.4532,1.5983,3.7148,0.1028,4.3219,1.391,0.0333,10.1425,0.6038,2.5563,3.4953,0.3038,4.0278,7.8622,0.0119,4.4961,1.6976,0.8641,0.0004,5.4674,4.1074,4.3967,0.7439,5.1631,4.8864,2.3494,4.0764,0.3428,0.6918,0.0002,5.7881,3.9766,7.4838,0.2959,0.843,6.0789,0.7426,5.2195,4.9401,1.1127,0.3323,3.827,2.1698,3.0247,4.2721,0.7726,0.1851,0.7505,6.7554,2.0796,3.3462,7.3013,5.6003,4.528,7.0531,3.9279,2.6881,2.765,1.8683,4.9453,4.3313,1.1596,3.0888,2.0184,1.3516,3.3982,2.756,2.8483,5.3826,0.2152,3.4253,2.9401,3.8323,1.6658,2.0513,0.0003,4.5354,3.4147,0.4571,1.0036,1.7348,4.3523,7.4575,3.2192,4.3822,2.4076,5.1227,2.0932,1.0247,1.0711,2.0602,0.1879,3.7349,3.6851,4.7234,4.0954,1.9257,3.0696,0.8593,2.4772,2.3598,0.524,5.7003,1.1717,0.8879,1.812,2.2067,0.1284,1.6013,4.2842,3.4227,4.4173,2.2225,3.4802,1.248,1.3058,2.7793,3.0499,0.0355,1.9193,4.3762,0.5235,0.3829,0.6734,0.8048,5.9539,0.5739,1.1748,2.1732,3.3509,4.3614,1.9051,3.0762,0.3477,1.1593,2.1392,4.9506,0.2917,3.7811,2.9264,1.2458,0.615,1.6762,3.3595,4.8122,3.1984,5.9553,0.0278,1.7312,2.5061,1.3786,1.6287,0.3704,2.0154,0.7593,1.6563,3.9632,1.774,5.4395,2.4783,5.4596,1.0486,0.9087,3.5674,1.2917,1.8443,3.8225,1.5517,2.9954,2.045,5.4269,5.8066,3.5415,4.0764,3.1377,1.9188,3.6028,3.9576,2.9237,2.1717,2.9868,1.4013,3.2587,0.4915,1.0949,1.2969,1.8814,2.3302,2.0636,5.7925,1.9856,2.1344,1.8559,0.6878,3.4688,1.2949,4.6921,3.4227,0.0745,5.6805,3.9138,0.7451,3.5127,0.438,4.5646,5.6476,3.4078,0.6997,0.6453,0.9795,0.0002,1.9919,0.5377,6.4828,6.478,2.263,3.0937,1.1124,5.1668,6.3968,0.0207,5.6731,0.9557,3.9644,2.8098,1.7061,4.5133,1.816,2.8643,2.1448,3.3176,2.4849,1.0105,3.6882,2.3134,0.6015,0.7631,2.0674,2.3771,0.7568,2.196,1.5671,0.2729,0.9151,3.7356,1.1999,0.7063,2.7187,1.1892,0.2156,0.4758,3.594,0.9118,2.0482,2.7656,2.327,4.787,1.5878,1.2725,1.8477,0.1692,4.2977,7.3404,1.5539,5.1869,0.2375,3.5087,1.3533,1.2712,0.5545,0.132,3.2136,2.3704,0.8743,1.7785,1.6915,2.7653,1.4365,4.3881,1.6001,3.5739,0.342,0.5089,2.5712,0.1808,0.1789,0.5989,6.2687,0.7509,3.8872,1.7479,2.8998,1.8859,4.8977,3.0135,5.1049,2.1504,3.8524,1.0574,4.5574,2.0216,2.0791,4.864,0.7878,1.1411,0.9842,0.0002,3.7608,4.8859,0.4328,2.1387,2.2944,5.0916,1.8039,1.2501,3.3418,0.883,4.4424,4.3149,0.1976,2.952,0.0139,2.4112,1.4556,2.6045,0.7403,1.8949,2.7251,6.5602,0.3445,4.2793,2.6599,3.5354,3.6473,6.9364,1.6203,4.8848,3.2004,0.1634,0.0695,0.391]}

{"id":1026,"ended":false,"length":344,"text":"Valhalla is filled with the strongest warriors the world has ever known. Vikings, Spartans, Mongols, Romans, Samurai, Spetznaz, JSOC Operators. And in that corner over there? That's Ted, from accounting.\n\nThe most interesting thing about Valhalla is that it has a strong sense of being, and it is filled with all of the best warriors that can be found in Western, European, and Indian communities. It really gets people involved in these new wars every once in a while.

{"id":140,"ended":true,"length":347,"text":"A young child suspects that his grandpa's walking stick is an artifact of great power.' - [Katherine]\n\nI'm sure he can tell you who \"is\" the great power here, but what is a great power? An artifact, by the way, is an artifact of great power, and that is more true of the nations of the world than we ever imagined. And because the universe, if it chooses to define it, is not a very scientific universe and has no reason to exist, it is not really a grand power. That's how we're meant to act and live. To tell that story is to call out the false narrative about humanity and its great forces as though they never existed.\n\n\"But you must see that the universe is a grand power.\" - [David] Niven\n\nOur world has more than a simple and abstract notion of power, and that is why it takes our imagination to draw our conclusions about all things. That's why I've been talking about that concept of power in my book The Art of Being. For generations of readers, that idea has been held to be pretty much always true, but it has been held to be so utterly outdated that it is almost unappealing to even people who have no strong idea of their value.\n\nOur imagination is far from the only ability to draw that conclusion. It's a power that can produce great results. And it is almost always far from the only potential power. But when you turn those ideas around, you can't deny that the potential power we have in the universe is even more powerful than simply seeing it.\n\nAt the same time, though, we should consider that this potential influence is only powerful in its own right, not so sure it is.","token_len":360,"entropy":[8.2558,4.4491,11.3695,1.2204,2.2941,8.1932,0.8879,2.9841,9.2521,1.4984,1.3913,3.487,4.7915,0.454,7.5124,1.5404,7.2992,4.1375,6.3435,5.5163,4.4675,2.5046,1.1552,0.0272,4.5103,2.5364,3.2268,3.2284,4.2923,3.3278,1.1112,4.4573,6.9409,5.3588,0.8382,2.222,4.7593,0.7254,4.2669,1.6949,1.3687,3.5167,2.6283,4.249,1.8533,0.062,0.9519,4.8199,1.6719,2.6308,4.8513,0.7845,0.0541,1.5485,1.6963,2.637,1.3473,0.7786,0.4666,0.0529,1.7968,1.6768,2.8856,1.4538,5.7644,4.3482,1.235,2.0906,8.4283,1.0207,0.7832,0.9931,0.9507,4.7184,3.5723,2.3664,0.3363,3.1981,5.2399,2.3257,6.357,4.166,4.8612,1.6177,6.4717,0.3041,5.5564,1.6863,0.3971,1.0659,2.7805,2.0531,4.7752,5.8538,3.6076,4.6238,3.2435,1.3493,5.109,0.2962,1.8428,0.7001,1.752,1.1499,2.0212,4.2013,1.2619,5.7151,1.491,0.7139,3.4536,1.5595,4.0049,2.2125,3.8327,4.5004,0.0105,6.8593,3.6357,4.123,0.9068,5.1962,5.1255,3.921,0.9835,1.7252,1.0223,5.9448,2.7704,1.374,5.879,4.1026,3.8037,5.5619,1.8498,2.3457,3.9804,6.271,4.5168,4.536,1.3239,5.5434,0.2134,0.7339,1.1378,0.0003,4.8542,3.9013,3.0961,4.4926,4.6567,1.8218,2.0995,3.0935,0.8954,2.1445,3.2137,0.2392,2.6051,0.5255,0.4611,5.3862,0.4052,10.1572,2.873,0.7308,0.0002,5.9819,2.9422,2.4945,4.8023,1.927,2.0341,5.042,4.3761,4.8006,2.1966,0.0553,1.9168,1.3344,1.6262,2.2542,1.3559,1.694,2.0449,5.6984,4.8758,4.0517,1.0433,5.6217,3.7642,2.4365,1.8756,5.1465,1.8621,0.6373,3.6393,1.1724,0.4856,3.1981,3.0924,1.8459,3.7173,0.5506,4.4725,4.2515,1.4134,1.5169,2.3044,1.898,1.6143,2.9723,4.2452,0.1137,2.5031,1.9418,4.8116,7.2397,3.3422,4.2471,0.6625,3.0953,2.4566,1.1658,0.4951,5.264,2.424,0.1928,5.9361,2.6248,5.6503,1.9232,1.2818,1.6995,1.7549,1.539,1.7372,4.7262,0.6219,0.2408,4.0702,5.9362,6.287,1.0029,0.923,1.8555,2.5165,4.5677,3.5969,0.3968,0.4533,4.44,3.4778,0.2756,1.903,4.1378,5.9365,3.4908,1.0447,5.2862,7.5711,1.2939,1.4288,0.0002,5.5447,5.5633,1.0703,5.0022,1.6954,2.8174,0.4407,5.836,0.855,1.6498,3.7412,1.9087,0.4485,2.8617,1.5587,2.6098,3.9544,0.6751,3.166,6.0035,3.3224,2.7133,1.367,2.502,1.9129,1.5891,5.4776,1.0589,6.0977,1.4218,0.9907,1.4159,5.8819,1.1531,1.3556,3.6367,3.55,1.4703,5.3661,4.8661,2.9984,2.6312,0.6569,1.1141,2.2767,3.6148,4.6556,0.8771,2.2551,4.9665,0.9665,4.2301,0.9902,2.8711,1.4504,1.3913,0.5263,4.2322,1.4402,1.7223,0.1944,7.5902,4.5824,1.6924,0.9537,0.8618,0.0001,5.5779,0.8923,1.3623,0.0046,0.074,3.6651,0.0682,1.536,3.6972,5.2596,1.2889,3.8011,4.6297,8.0926,1.0637,3.6253,6.8241,2.7137,2.8833,1.0992,0.1207,1.1749,2.0773,5.3546,9.207,2.1412,1.7449,5.5104]}

I've been a mod here for years, and I remember the times, and while I was here, I kept hearing shit, like \"They can't take your marijuana now, they can't give you enough, what the fuck? What's the point?\" But for some reason, everything I've said in the past has been very negative.\nWell, if nothing else, you're allowed to call it \"the power\", then you're allowed to act like an ass (or even try doing that). I had the opposite experience because everything I said was very negative to all those I have talked to \/ interacted with - there was no good reason to think we were really bad mods. Especially when we were always so focused on spamming \/ reposting \/ etc.\nLol yeah that's exactly what happened. The fuck is wrong with us.  I've been mod since they brought it to light and I think it's a good time to take a break. I hate that shit.   It's the only thing I want from me and that's where this is going. I feel like we are all in danger of getting our shit fucked up.\nIf anything, it's a symptom of the lack of content that we are missing on this sub. While I agree that this subreddit has a rich shit-load of shit... I agree that there are too many mods for the sidebar to be that useful.

{"id":843,"ended":true,"length":339,"text":"Freddy Kreuger deeply regrets entering the dreams of his latest intended victim - The Joker\nFreddy Kreuger was one of the very first victims of crime who would find his way into his mind, and his latest film has given an emotional and gripping look, with Alfred Hitchcock as the \"hero.\"\nIn the film, which deals with the aftermath of the 1987 New York City mass shooting, Alfred will confront Freddie, played by the late actor Richard Branson, as the young man, inspired to attack the town's famous gunstore, \"Gunsmoke,\" as a teenager.\nFreddie has a passion for life but the film deals with the darker side because his grandfather is gunned down on the corner of West 20th Street and West 42nd Avenue on the night of the shooting.\n\"I got away from the world. I didn't know where I was or where the hell I was going,\" Freddy tells the reporter.\nBut there's nothing going on. Freddy is a dangerous boy who has to fight for his existence in a town where the police know that he is wanted for shooting down and killing people in his sight.\n\"You never really have any control over how much you hurt people,\" Freddy jokes, \"but you have control.\"\nWith the film, an all-time record six New York City movies have topped the charts, including New York's best-seller \"I Believe\" featuring a killer who has already escaped capture, but also many of the other best-selling titles which are set in the world of crime.\n\"He had a very large screen. He used [it] in a big way. I haven't shot a film in my life where I was onscreen, but it was a big film made for him,\" Freddy says.","token_len":361,"entropy":[8.2713,6.7043,3.7646,0.1076,13.473,1.4901,8.1099,0.6807,12.4304,0.2974,1.269,8.421,10.7566,2.0563,5.2693,5.334,4.0351,5.3944,18.3611,0.0089,0.2205,0.004,0.0018,2.9236,3.186,0.0399,0.6065,4.679,1.0048,3.5241,0.6905,7.5599,3.1559,3.8148,4.8059,1.881,1.3336,0.9363,2.5636,3.9245,2.2785,1.5491,2.8279,5.9673,8.5058,3.6876,3.7201,4.5715,3.8661,2.1524,6.1104,1.7387,7.8808,3.1392,7.0978,3.3671,3.19,0.9043,6.1457,4.0551,2.6547,1.1119,7.5459,1.3955,1.3995,0.3604,3.2822,7.4096,0.0924,0.9718,3.1676,0.0162,0.8464,7.5377,4.5884,0.0724,1.1233,4.9208,1.0399,0.4136,2.9356,5.6084,4.2522,8.3787,1.6944,4.4075,0.0132,3.2346,2.6872,3.2451,4.7787,5.1901,0.047,0.3108,2.4924,2.2772,4.6605,1.1879,5.018,7.2214,3.2679,6.1608,1.696,5.0067,2.3488,4.9713,4.9413,7.126,2.262,4.2372,4.0163,4.0114,0.0147,1.7683,3.1584,2.7186,5.5323,0.1965,0.4468,1.1036,3.59,3.9691,2.2175,6.1656,0.0325,4.1476,5.1212,3.9611,4.0272,6.2978,0.3108,1.2865,5.2788,0.4088,8.3062,3.8795,7.4384,2.6968,6.3,0.0053,3.477,0.9454,5.7581,0.1672,3.6413,5.9836,0.0038,0.229,0.0858,3.3269,4.0226,0.0004,1.4094,3.5024,2.0035,1.1984,0.1537,0.8361,1.4773,0.5807,0.4119,2.6861,1.9098,5.0344,6.8564,1.2527,1.7136,2.9456,3.7866,0.5185,2.6766,0.0002,2.0408,2.8145,0.4462,0.2435,3.8001,1.5162,4.3038,1.8322,0.1404,0.1377,0.2057,1.0881,1.9266,2.1657,1.6753,4.7279,0.8929,0.9598,4.628,4.4288,2.0027,3.7243,6.6121,0.3186,2.4243,2.3388,1.6189,2.9098,6.3741,4.6939,1.0573,2.0764,3.2196,3.2514,1.3728,0.3392,5.7964,2.9505,1.9225,5.3535,1.3647,2.5825,2.536,4.6847,3.2957,1.3323,1.5652,6.6648,0.9478,3.9445,4.2108,6.2095,0.8699,2.7289,2.9727,3.1309,6.2915,0.3608,0.3735,1.4033,3.265,3.8442,3.2614,4.1369,2.5924,2.806,0.4082,3.6869,3.3889,0.8291,4.7138,2.248,1.4694,0.8573,6.1037,2.2111,1.6114,1.7122,1.2287,1.6443,0.695,4.0174,0.2371,5.5345,1.7915,2.9748,1.4201,6.7244,4.3969,0.446,6.1963,4.0211,7.6925,5.633,0.0963,0.4107,4.1547,1.3045,7.4744,0.9377,2.8016,1.0051,1.3521,5.8934,0.2315,1.6107,3.8762,0.4881,2.7242,1.1979,4.7502,5.2287,2.6783,5.5489,3.5767,5.6297,2.1117,3.1096,4.3865,6.0148,4.4602,1.8802,4.8331,3.702,5.5882,1.6754,0.4141,4.7505,1.8652,0.1485,0.8417,4.0336,6.5037,2.9697,3.8257,0.8224,1.1427,3.9297,0.3619,2.0169,1.8411,0.2717,1.802,4.7209,3.954,1.541,2.8967,4.6927,5.8304,3.8369,0.9093,4.9581,7.464,5.2557,0.2719,2.9409,2.0372,3.5945,0.1572,1.6791,2.5258,6.4069,0.001,6.0187,1.4177,1.4488,1.9628,2.884,0.1796,2.6601,0.997,2.6369,4.3874,4.5141,2.4037,1.2978,2.5429,0.8477,1.7945,1.0192,4.9456,7.7961,1.6351,1.4926,0.9535,0.9924,0.9972,0.3604]}

{"id":4227,"ended":true,"length":344,"text":"Humanity is capable of living thousands of years, provided they can get past the larva stage, which ends at 150 years old.\nI don't think I can get past the larva stage, I suppose I can, but what about the longevity? Is it a fact that they live on 100 years, if they survive that long?  I have a feeling the more I read the less I'm willing to believe.\nFrom what I understand they are able to survive until around the age of 20.  They will have to adapt to the modern world due to climate change etc.\nThey won't only be able to survive through modern times if they get through it.  It will be the opposite for them.  Humans will have to change as to how people interact with the environment in order to survive.  I wouldn't put it past humans to do that much.\nIt will also be the opposite for many.  They can and will survive in most areas, though.  Once you have all of their brains and minds working properly you can start to build a functioning ecosystem that is capable of keeping them in check.  No, don't take that away from them.\nPeople can live in a better habitat than we do. Our native ecosystem is the same size as ours and as long as we get our energy from the sun we will be ok. Our survival is the same as theirs.  I know there's a lot of other examples of human activity similar to what we use to do for many of the other animals out there. But to me the most telling story that could come from mankind is a story about the human race. We are simply in a different world and the way we live affects the way we live too. They're not going anywhere for that too.","token_len":362,"entropy":[7.4121,2.5141,7.1537,0.0393,4.5743,8.4332,0.1154,0.1365,2.3285,7.0364,2.9722,2.9051,4.4604,4.3972,0.7712,10.5004,1.6073,1.8713,2.1117,1.7252,5.4023,2.0446,7.8394,2.3668,1.1844,0.5005,1.6015,10.1213,3.3889,0.0008,1.4234,2.5034,2.4899,3.3665,0.4593,1.0028,0.9849,0.0299,0.067,1.7055,3.1401,5.8965,2.2684,1.5546,3.3508,0.5028,4.1391,2.6555,0.964,6.0207,1.2671,4.3027,1.0052,3.1783,4.9199,0.2576,4.4742,2.8957,4.2442,5.7581,2.8621,1.8753,3.4738,1.6543,3.7694,2.1711,0.1562,0.9305,8.4094,9.0509,3.4809,2.2579,2.2299,3.3281,5.266,1.9483,1.8254,2.0368,4.9355,1.267,3.5865,3.8363,0.0143,1.7758,2.8319,1.1394,6.0063,2.2836,0.1376,1.95,3.5517,1.795,3.306,0.0107,1.6315,4.6815,3.6208,3.433,1.4031,0.0456,4.1736,1.3307,2.2811,2.962,3.4708,2.845,2.5954,5.3498,0.5854,1.4101,4.9142,0.7825,6.6136,0.0196,4.1445,0.0995,7.2738,0.4739,1.6593,3.3566,4.671,0.0008,5.3936,2.0339,0.283,0.0035,0.5528,3.7128,5.3871,4.6614,5.1967,0.3531,2.9864,2.1214,4.081,2.1899,0.8925,3.2941,1.8541,1.0003,3.2214,5.7504,1.8508,1.3653,1.644,1.0649,5.8567,1.7384,2.389,0.6868,4.1609,4.2245,4.843,0.9307,5.9523,3.3106,0.1942,1.877,2.1162,3.0273,0.7464,0.1301,0.697,0.5911,1.0327,2.5917,4.8473,0.0007,4.3395,1.5203,0.2696,3.727,0.2588,3.612,1.3707,7.388,1.7333,0.8143,3.5584,1.9263,2.4225,0.7299,1.8116,1.2179,0.3762,5.2756,4.3699,0.3785,2.697,3.3627,6.211,0.3483,2.5172,2.8765,5.8217,3.9068,2.5191,5.0065,3.876,0.4839,6.6521,2.2304,2.4563,4.8025,1.6908,3.6636,6.2072,1.7651,5.1479,3.7351,3.8979,2.4005,1.0821,3.5788,0.4515,4.4792,1.6089,5.9445,4.7096,2.9426,2.1177,2.7314,0.022,4.3841,1.4246,2.8462,1.9238,0.5659,1.0316,6.4094,3.1346,5.2875,0.0002,3.5059,2.3396,3.1538,0.5377,1.3244,0.4199,1.1497,5.6983,2.8797,2.116,2.5815,1.9081,5.602,5.2544,2.5361,2.5474,1.1345,1.2186,7.9977,5.9356,4.3692,1.1307,4.5144,2.8303,4.6778,0.6313,0.7498,2.4091,4.5427,2.3943,0.0207,0.7506,3.7852,3.1463,5.2455,1.5145,1.7706,0.4168,1.1819,1.4692,1.1256,3.9116,0.2025,6.1418,6.1015,1.8779,3.1456,0.4045,1.0305,3.5021,0.5972,1.1331,2.6916,3.475,3.2408,2.9063,1.1731,0.8216,0.2135,5.0936,4.8679,1.0977,4.3132,5.4066,7.6474,0.0323,2.184,1.1961,6.4754,0.8374,3.6688,4.5977,5.6591,2.769,1.5914,2.2806,1.5755,3.5258,0.0329,0.8633,3.2061,4.0878,1.6714,2.5824,1.8418,4.2185,5.0958,3.4327,4.2033,3.3018,1.1889,7.2516,0.4242,4.0816,2.6238,1.2287,2.4007,3.7386,2.555,1.3264,4.6062,1.7631,6.1785,5.0611,1.0177,2.0191,1.9384,2.4992,3.1576,3.6361,0.6518,1.2589,4.5469,2.1549,0.497,0.2732,1.3758,5.1938,0.1467,5.848,3.7346,1.8475,2.5265,2.5163,4.4409,3.2833,6.5885,0.4054]}

Most people call a \"fad restaurant,\" and we'd be happy to call it an 'old school Fad' restaurant in North Carolina. It's really a very strange food.

The problem with society is that it wants to suppress any people they see as bad (or worse) so that they can do the bad things they want to do.\nWhat about people who are afraid of their death because of one thing, but because they are scared of being afraid of being \"bad\"?\nIt isn't always about them being afraid of dying but rather about doing the bad things they want to do because they want to try as much to as they can.   Or you can just think of it as a \"good thing\" that you won't die out of fear, you'd be happy with dying because you'd stop being afraid because you will do the good things you want to do, all because you don't need to be worried about dying that day.\nSo you would think that, or that having only one possible death would be better than death knowing that you're always the one being afraid?\nNo.  I just think that having one possible death doesn't make you a good person.  I mean, I don't think anyone who dies of cancer or heart disease or other serious problems should die of a medical condition other than they've known their condition for almost 50 years.\nWhat of the other causes cause you to feel terrible?\nYeah I don't think the other cause necessarily causes the death of the illness.  But certainly in the case of cancer the way cancer symptoms would have to seem to cause the death of someone else (as opposed to being the patient's own body) to cause the end of a life.","token_len":362,"entropy":[5.4811,11.6653,2.1297,7.0211,1.8379,2.3255,5.6132,4.1905,1.3982,0.0339,0.0197,0.0075,1.5872,1.4926,1.1497,2.5537,0.3755,2.5949,1.2937,2.7149,3.2509,4.8304,1.8908,3.7146,4.6558,8.4363,2.0871,3.5346,4.8063,2.1636,4.7087,0.0246,2.1538,3.1261,2.7234,4.7197,2.8005,4.6528,0.406,0.7526,1.4296,2.0472,2.0582,4.2607,6.3478,1.3133,4.3316,4.1213,1.676,6.2422,0.6132,0.6939,1.3526,5.7982,0.6363,6.4113,3.6711,5.2212,4.7344,2.7001,0.2695,3.9234,5.7641,2.329,3.2284,0.9344,3.7597,0.9866,0.852,0.6302,3.9466,3.0358,4.0098,0.7141,1.4491,1.0095,0.5128,0.0711,0.7543,1.7924,10.5687,4.0646,3.5542,0.4951,1.4791,4.6762,0.7023,3.1811,8.7343,3.4252,1.4684,6.6995,2.5599,1.9378,3.3452,5.2546,0.9236,3.2257,3.1859,0.3703,2.6695,6.4241,0.1459,2.4581,4.9736,2.5989,0.3904,1.5234,3.379,5.2453,0.0006,4.398,3.0777,4.8517,2.0125,1.2707,0.4638,3.8349,4.2297,2.4998,0.7886,5.5659,1.9535,1.8132,0.0718,0.7292,0.2562,0.0784,0.019,4.0479,0.7364,2.3732,0.2007,6.4635,6.0187,2.5583,6.0791,5.8236,2.6167,0.1304,1.1589,7.7568,6.7761,6.7052,4.6773,1.2247,2.612,3.6636,1.5562,1.4723,0.2733,1.7281,3.415,3.3909,1.1785,0.5584,1.9012,2.0987,6.1744,0.0129,3.6643,6.2151,0.7183,1.5346,2.1222,4.0713,6.012,1.604,3.4655,2.7395,6.1426,4.2422,0.6666,3.1141,5.4451,1.5929,0.5263,4.3825,0.5339,5.2484,3.551,0.9413,1.349,0.0869,0.8909,0.2793,0.0587,0.0449,2.2307,5.5969,2.3308,0.5878,3.508,0.0011,3.3757,0.6422,1.9594,5.5653,0.2086,1.8838,4.9487,3.8941,0.3522,1.134,3.0048,3.3204,4.0424,1.8304,0.6195,3.9951,6.0307,2.8745,5.3839,5.7465,1.1298,6.4509,3.2907,1.0123,1.2878,2.9696,0.6611,3.7389,5.6794,0.9272,1.2911,2.5964,4.9883,4.1124,1.0097,3.6443,2.7861,2.7748,1.3639,3.3459,1.0047,1.351,5.418,4.0595,1.6834,0.7813,2.7055,1.6676,0.8383,0.136,4.3346,0.0003,1.4404,0.9641,2.1772,1.8918,0.1998,0.9161,0.733,2.3673,3.3556,0.4562,1.8808,2.2428,0.0004,1.4541,4.3938,2.6712,3.2937,2.7366,2.9067,2.0831,1.7481,0.2376,1.7529,3.3012,3.0168,3.8402,2.6024,2.2213,0.9016,2.5522,5.6488,1.6864,6.0759,0.0147,5.9889,3.6811,4.9081,3.4344,4.6281,0.4466,4.7971,3.3177,0.1314,0.5083,2.6676,3.4049,6.6164,1.8504,3.2176,5.2345,8.7898,3.5315,1.2221,2.1003,5.7572,2.1295,1.0502,6.1158,4.4062,2.3748,0.0008,1.0123,3.5911,0.9352,3.0077,6.3777,1.3993,3.3184,4.0261,1.0851,2.4239,7.6116,1.0216,0.3972,3.4833,6.3275,4.2229,1.9429,0.9074,0.0368,2.4109,3.9467,4.8446,3.8867,7.2075,5.1431,2.9987,3.3672,6.6772,1.4825,2.5225,1.609,0.4262,0.3803,3.309,3.1406,4.0783,4.0946,2.0583,0.0063,3.2899,2.502,6.6913,1.0885,2.9169,4.5672,1.2704,4.0237,1.7906,0.8446,6.1468,0.7384,2.8648,1.4897,0.9254]}

Once they complete their sling shot around the Moon, they find out that all humans have disappeared.\n\nThe launch of the new Mars Orbiter (MAH) into orbit around the world has been successfully managed, and its mission is complete. This mission will test out the safety of the first stage of the mission, and to establish the conditions of the next stage so that it can be ready for takeoff from the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nThis mission brings NASA to the forefront of innovation, excellence, and scale of space technologies. The first stage of MAH will be assembled from a mix of the latest rocket design and manufacturing techniques, that have had the capability of changing the course of history as astronauts have passed to this new field of space research.\n\nThe mission will provide the science, engineering, and technological resources necessary to understand the history of human interaction on the planets of Mars, Venus, and Europa. MAH will also have a chance to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the technologies that NASA has been offering to humanity for decades.\n\nThe MAH Mission has had some dramatic improvements in the last decade. While some of these improvements have been the work of a little team of astronauts, others have been the result of a single attempt. This team is comprised of approximately 20 astronauts from NASA, ESA, ESA, ESA, and SpaceX, who have completed their third mission into orbit on this date. While no one of these astronauts has yet reached this far, some have been able to successfully take this mission far to Mars.\n\nSince both NASA-ESA and SpaceX-MCAFAR participated in the research and development activities of MAH during the NASA and ESA missions, the two companies will continue to work together on these future projects.","token_len":363,"entropy":[7.5205,0.5716,7.2666,3.9621,5.5634,1.144,4.402,2.8126,6.5547,2.1009,4.4448,0.8132,15.1495,4.6783,7.0244,0.7138,2.9386,0.3531,0.5818,8.0916,3.1571,0.8175,5.0668,5.522,1.4534,5.8898,1.1759,1.7496,0.0009,2.1163,7.366,1.4233,0.5933,3.9071,3.0205,3.2688,0.0033,3.0131,2.9458,8.4512,0.4132,3.9908,0.8588,3.2944,0.569,5.7547,2.6019,0.8263,5.9271,4.3526,2.3345,1.8532,4.8711,2.7406,1.1925,4.1401,0.2099,3.5659,2.985,1.3849,4.7693,3.1804,1.1133,4.7717,0.7864,1.3588,4.6091,2.5756,0.8986,0.5895,4.6587,0.9191,1.3669,3.6826,5.0147,1.2215,4.4835,3.2361,1.2381,2.5864,0.4149,5.2474,0.4721,1.0991,0.4776,1.3676,3.841,0.5119,6.4748,3.4089,0.8844,1.9498,0.0021,0.0011,1.8815,0.011,0.41,0.5267,0.0002,3.2315,1.7059,5.7298,4.6093,2.803,1.0592,1.9055,0.325,5.5137,2.0674,7.3274,0.6216,0.2451,5.9332,3.1265,1.5978,6.0164,0.7793,1.9297,3.5662,1.7073,0.4998,1.332,0.005,0.7386,1.3595,4.844,2.2981,2.1002,4.4001,0.0023,3.6581,2.9765,4.3516,4.7269,1.2549,3.5659,1.4242,0.7826,6.2099,3.7654,6.6632,1.9285,4.2592,1.7771,5.4964,0.55,3.0489,0.0236,2.0903,4.3188,5.3027,2.0252,5.3053,5.7161,5.0641,3.6245,7.3461,1.0561,1.1375,5.2602,0.3928,0.6266,0.0002,1.4802,2.7499,1.0106,3.6726,1.6037,6.2486,1.9833,1.7418,0.2109,0.3245,4.1732,3.9946,2.041,0.272,4.9712,0.8513,4.7628,0.2728,2.6817,5.7841,1.7836,0.7949,5.8141,2.5479,0.729,0.8468,3.8116,0.1049,0.603,5.616,0.6953,2.889,0.0028,0.2457,1.4287,4.5152,1.7078,4.6594,0.0494,2.9623,0.9547,5.5785,2.5833,0.1528,2.1146,4.5751,1.8164,5.8005,1.3029,2.5059,5.4278,1.3246,3.7055,1.6085,2.3863,0.6646,0.3984,0.0002,1.5064,2.3404,0.0023,3.992,4.9135,5.2147,3.7089,5.9384,4.4484,1.7692,1.3039,1.873,3.0577,0.87,4.8915,3.8388,0.9257,1.1584,0.6453,0.8552,0.5671,4.8568,3.7559,0.0594,3.138,6.259,5.0616,0.4233,2.2125,0.3827,2.3488,0.2765,0.2851,1.3483,2.7363,0.0054,2.1445,6.5014,5.4733,1.5655,2.6886,3.2178,2.4466,3.8092,0.0352,6.2438,2.9873,2.8463,1.277,1.6926,1.5697,3.4684,0.0744,4.2036,1.1261,4.9589,1.1771,0.8664,6.1116,1.5485,1.8741,1.6085,3.2947,2.0088,7.0885,2.4926,4.001,0.9734,3.0053,3.1951,5.7803,0.3063,6.1118,5.5011,1.7594,4.6482,0.8784,1.176,1.0976,2.2297,2.7922,4.6642,4.6753,0.3621,4.5015,1.9325,2.1224,2.2517,0.0093,3.3704,3.888,4.214,1.6929,5.5246,4.7491,3.6714,0.6031,0.353,0.0002,4.99,6.4395,2.7586,5.3932,2.9148,0.2606,1.9223,1.5702,6.2614,5.944,6.0126,7.4292,7.9008,0.0743,0.74,5.3971,1.2528,0.2619,6.1738,0.9966,1.5727,0.0023,3.167,0.9882,5.9023,3.5429,0.3984,2.0819,0.3089,1.6662,3.7738,2.5885,2.437,1.5077,0.299,1.2948,0.436,2.1687,3.511,4.4269,3.2153,0.3487]}

There is no more [second one in the books].\n\nI believe you'll have to give you some answers to that.\n\nIt's too soon to say if anything like this happens.","token_len":363,"entropy":[6.0257,5.9904,0.6493,3.3653,11.3895,11.6302,16.0516,0.9,4.0195,0.0833,3.8197,5.8478,3.5782,4.2468,0.001,1.9388,4.3364,7.3805,0.7832,1.4282,3.3637,2.8445,1.3197,1.6366,5.6566,2.0659,1.2641,3.4573,0.9768,2.2782,0.0414,2.7194,7.4813,2.3316,3.2404,1.437,0.5469,0.4877,0.001,0.4024,0.0011,4.8137,0.3048,0.0095,0.009,0.0011,0.0085,0.0267,0.4621,0.0098,0.0117,0.0012,0.0027,0.0006,0.001,0.0027,0.0004,0.0006,0.0008,0.0562,3.5513,1.8646,0.0002,5.2015,5.1275,4.0631,3.9599,5.5083,1.9056,4.0863,4.2557,1.3939,3.7212,0.0863,3.1935,2.1801,2.6669,1.7657,2.8049,4.4905,4.5131,0.3391,0.6477,1.4322,1.255,0.9189,1.751,0.6836,3.997,0.0967,0.3523,3.5795,4.2181,8.2016,4.5612,3.1104,3.3818,3.4403,0.5576,5.9619,3.0826,2.7541,3.7894,8.4248,3.4739,1.4403,2.6019,2.4542,1.0937,6.3425,0.6695,0.117,0.3158,0.5644,1.4958,0.0002,4.774,2.3092,3.0193,0.1905,0.2936,1.0693,2.1945,2.2798,6.0852,0.6079,0.2818,5.8764,1.6741,2.0766,3.104,0.6793,1.6004,5.5256,3.1654,2.7306,5.8992,2.9305,2.1315,3.3028,3.7291,6.1541,2.0902,2.4723,1.2252,2.0164,3.0257,2.6211,0.0473,2.9399,6.554,2.0751,5.3759,1.4157,0.6397,1.4884,3.4777,0.4905,4.4863,0.725,0.6798,0.0001,3.4056,4.7868,3.3231,4.8894,2.0417,8.2719,3.4973,1.1757,6.3502,0.0444,5.4009,1.011,4.2816,4.6082,1.5757,0.7139,1.7688,4.7558,1.5664,1.4744,0.0049,3.649,5.4746,2.3329,3.4065,6.6992,0.0018,4.8713,1.5425,5.9884,0.1846,1.349,3.6528,3.3564,3.0176,1.5855,1.06,2.7295,3.4052,0.0045,2.8103,2.621,0.8984,7.4053,2.6507,0.3407,6.1441,2.2512,4.4281,3.7152,1.2864,2.3231,2.4865,1.5724,6.7969,3.7411,2.2561,2.27,0.0039,2.1068,5.4656,2.323,2.9416,5.431,2.1662,8.282,3.9167,0.0763,1.0199,1.6411,2.4733,1.0626,1.3747,3.8438,6.7175,2.1511,2.7022,1.1637,1.2016,5.3033,1.6194,9.9121,14.9874,0.2099,0.2374,0.1403,0.9655,3.679,1.0807,1.5092,4.5941,0.2436,2.6224,4.4584,3.5746,2.7436,4.0695,3.1276,2.9349,3.9243,1.5702,1.604,0.8771,0.9297,4.4192,0.4281,4.8899,2.1473,0.0917,0.181,0.1448,1.0422,2.3982,0.1436,0.3773,5.055,0.0455,4.2499,3.0127,6.4115,3.8352,4.2341,0.3392,3.4287,4.9966,3.1597,2.3223,0.0002,0.5424,6.0677,0.5379,3.3446,1.4368,1.7719,2.5849,1.1398,0.6766,3.3159,0.102,1.5194,0.2551,1.7068,4.7942,4.4408,0.4322,2.0981,6.372,1.7219,0.6294,0.0002,2.7086,2.4082,0.8851,1.9683,3.1958,0.2347,0.7909,2.7722,0.3737,0.6116,3.9145,1.8362,1.9356,2.0317,7.2861,5.1815,3.091,4.9643,0.4183,3.8521,0.8143,1.2607,0.0002,2.3796,5.1977,3.0409,2.0165,3.0799,0.9103,4.0274,6.2467,2.4325,5.7994,1.7742,1.3168,1.1171,0.8628,0.0001,4.1777,0.8812,6.3832,2.578,0.264,1.5859,2.8198,5.9713,5.0796,1.5135,3.9123,1.6187]}

Not sure what kind of future historians you would want to focus on, but history is a subject that can be taught quite well, so having it as a \"concept\" makes a lot of sense.\n> Having it as a \"concept\" makes a lot of sense.  Sure, but there are other ways this might happen. They could just create a new time and use it in some form. That's what I said in my previous comment.\nSo like if you had all of this history that you had back in time and everything else in your life.  Now your only option is making some weird history at home and then you leave that behind.  What you got to do to get that past that time?  I don't know the answer, and that is why I have this theory.  However, what if you did all those other stuff but you had to do it before the time ended.  Not what I had in mind.\nTime travel and time travel in general would involve a much, much larger number of subjects than just the one where everything happened. My guess is that history will be taught differently. People will be better off with just history. If it didn't have the chance to teach you things about those topics, and therefore would be extremely useful, then I think I'd prefer just having some kind of story. But that is just me.\nYou're not really that kind of person, then.  You can get into the history of everything in time and start talking about it, and talk about it in a normal conversation.  But you're also not too keen on anything of anything specific.","token_len":364,"entropy":[10.1823,2.1921,9.7099,2.4451,3.1789,5.9865,1.2608,9.3797,1.2554,8.8132,1.0065,5.7184,6.1329,2.7376,0.9314,16.6543,7.3486,4.4907,3.079,0.0164,0.1164,0.5296,1.4883,9.1007,3.5118,0.0009,1.5545,6.151,0.0782,0.7861,4.8658,1.6836,5.8365,5.8749,2.0652,5.3245,0.0548,4.4164,6.9067,3.2195,2.7692,1.2126,0.5325,6.4034,0.2148,1.8381,0.6433,6.1657,0.7374,2.1301,5.4475,1.4026,2.8511,0.5739,3.7725,6.4823,1.3345,2.1918,2.5336,5.5841,3.7458,3.0637,0.7021,5.9545,6.4787,0.2761,4.0541,2.9077,0.6708,0.1473,0.0176,0.2332,0.8939,7.8095,8.4158,0.6974,0.0174,0.0052,0.1086,0.0073,0.0227,0.0474,0.0134,0.0017,0.0011,0.0012,0.4231,6.159,12.8205,0.4987,5.2322,3.4271,0.9739,2.838,1.911,6.1176,3.5161,2.5526,1.0278,5.985,1.3425,4.0142,5.0295,1.0312,2.4815,3.3123,2.7677,4.0305,0.6547,3.3857,2.8051,3.6488,1.1799,3.8798,1.6069,2.5746,1.8529,5.3964,2.9646,1.1234,2.0475,5.4721,0.8294,1.5223,4.0635,7.0789,5.1387,1.2601,3.3461,4.1938,1.9531,3.089,3.3235,4.297,1.0162,2.972,6.5622,1.0757,4.361,2.2911,5.0761,3.8774,3.2264,2.3353,1.8497,5.429,3.8418,5.7691,4.884,3.4426,2.1098,0.5404,6.0825,3.5067,5.7047,3.8137,5.6137,4.3759,1.9988,2.5875,3.6256,4.8648,3.7281,3.669,0.7768,2.0087,4.6581,3.1133,4.8371,2.9614,0.8976,4.7714,2.2915,2.7671,3.6279,5.1563,3.9002,3.5535,1.1702,2.64,1.8634,0.0008,0.9604,4.7954,0.9563,2.2295,3.5979,3.014,2.3957,2.6594,0.5877,3.7284,2.8914,3.802,1.1783,1.9918,5.4693,0.4156,4.0729,2.7733,0.8191,3.5777,3.3663,4.6533,2.0493,3.9854,4.9133,1.8815,2.2349,1.6182,3.4506,1.0546,5.2887,2.3565,2.2895,6.7063,2.9435,0.7523,5.38,4.6354,0.6369,4.077,1.2985,0.0148,1.1946,1.3212,6.4926,0.4361,4.8423,2.9351,0.2433,3.2006,1.3585,4.0499,4.9611,2.3868,5.1415,5.834,0.0433,2.2931,3.8696,0.0291,5.3625,1.8477,2.5896,2.1579,3.8916,5.6742,4.9336,2.2344,1.1479,6.5385,2.5418,0.1943,0.3527,6.2231,2.5565,1.4868,3.9538,4.3553,1.7954,5.5431,1.2795,2.1805,3.3973,2.4027,2.3326,4.1199,4.1544,1.6572,4.1173,3.316,4.3286,0.0004,2.127,3.2429,5.7127,0.3202,2.0418,2.6939,3.8115,1.9241,4.7894,3.3687,0.7293,4.2326,6.4567,4.2384,1.929,6.9788,4.1292,1.0565,1.1781,2.4243,1.7464,4.5422,1.5177,3.7128,4.5868,3.7121,3.1937,3.2346,0.002,3.993,2.3617,3.4767,2.4213,2.3012,2.6571,2.1135,0.9534,1.3735,3.9854,3.3418,2.5817,3.7051,4.3182,3.5064,0.0026,1.0132,1.7715,6.2886,0.2994,1.2036,2.7695,3.3745,3.8102,3.1294,2.5562,4.8311,0.4459,4.3263,2.8903,4.697,1.6267,5.2488,3.7604,0.1762,1.8463,2.0015,1.9318,5.7337,0.1081,0.7283,2.4008,1.3604,6.636,4.2747,0.7148,1.088,1.7701,1.6842,1.9479,3.8598,0.7708,6.522,4.4911,0.0813,5.4724,5.3147,6.0849,4.6486,0.7474]}

I have a feeling this is an ongoing project; what if Pok\u00e9mon comes with a special ability to be a Pok\u00e9mon clone? Or, perhaps, it will finally make sense for a Pok\u00e9mon-themed game to have a single-player play mode? That's what I decided to put on my Youtube playlist today!\n\nIn this playlist, the four Pok\u00e9mon that will be appearing and the Pok\u00e9mon you will be playing as as your favorite Pok\u00e9mon. Take a look at how I was able to come up with the idea here:\n\nHere's the music for you to choose from:\n\n1.\n\nI had to make this list because it wasn't really right what all of these Pok\u00e9mon were all about. There are so many different kinds of Pok\u00e9mon in these games and I know that some Pok\u00e9mon seem like you don't know what you're doing and it's impossible to keep it simple for me.\n\nI just want them all to feel like you belong as well.\n\n2.\n\nIn regards to my list of Pok\u00e9mon you will be playing as, you can find more out here:\n\n3.\n\nHere's a sampling of this playlist from my Youtube playlist:\n\n4.\n\nIt was important to make sure that all the pokemon in this playlist were available by the time I was done listening. I hope that by the time you listen to the song, you will have already done all of the music you said you would, so if you can't find the song right away, you are in the clear.","token_len":364,"entropy":[9.5036,8.0302,3.9846,7.3394,5.0939,7.7259,0.9875,3.5257,1.0843,6.7797,6.2742,5.2038,12.5368,5.598,0.4055,5.268,4.5398,6.318,0.0676,2.4938,4.8718,6.676,1.0336,3.0866,4.1234,5.7255,0.1594,4.4808,1.2995,4.5992,4.1387,2.0316,7.4622,4.1162,1.3718,3.3776,4.578,4.4249,5.4153,6.2237,3.5769,4.0827,4.4696,2.9415,3.2453,2.1435,2.8861,0.1205,3.48,0.2833,3.7574,1.6029,2.9803,3.3754,1.9127,3.3212,2.7188,1.8051,4.6959,3.9582,2.9719,5.7563,5.288,3.5702,3.0369,5.6576,4.1781,1.3016,3.3861,2.9782,3.0535,3.9648,3.8745,2.8133,7.8235,0.7678,3.5289,2.7771,3.9656,1.0149,4.9033,2.2278,5.2635,4.1039,2.6298,2.8211,1.9456,1.974,3.8253,2.103,2.1586,2.0745,2.4858,1.0173,6.1583,2.6422,0.1135,6.025,3.0544,0.9578,4.1288,0.7936,1.9067,0.9243,5.8936,0.3744,4.4483,3.0934,1.7485,7.3393,3.3911,3.5201,2.871,1.3097,0.005,3.8769,2.0713,5.5049,0.4033,4.4033,5.2785,1.9333,2.2457,3.0639,0.7939,4.2417,5.317,3.8266,2.2008,2.9447,1.4898,1.5625,2.946,2.5983,5.345,4.0379,4.276,0.8834,1.9468,6.4824,0.3042,0.227,0.6533,3.6293,3.3752,4.5459,0.3831,0.0009,4.839,0.0142,0.0024,1.3972,1.1742,5.7719,1.1692,0.2811,0.0002,4.0792,0.8506,1.2897,5.033,1.7787,6.3191,1.5817,3.9795,0.2172,1.1093,0.1497,0.0002,6.3338,0.2984,5.3609,0.0002,4.3391,4.2083,2.0798,2.3696,1.6996,4.7908,1.1076,2.1995,4.5069,0.0006,3.5895,6.6785,6.7511,7.5184,1.5557,2.2494,1.044,2.3145,4.816,0.0885,0.7929,3.6128,1.0652,1.7587,0.0204,1.5256,3.1997,0.0833,0.1552,2.2412,4.7786,1.4317,2.2939,1.7211,5.5848,1.5769,2.5541,4.1176,4.9761,2.4466,5.7642,3.7677,0.0005,2.7993,1.3539,1.6981,0.382,1.5752,2.5817,3.4018,0.955,5.5337,0.1841,3.7881,4.591,2.1069,3.3105,2.6474,0.4948,2.5083,0.0002,2.4602,4.4603,3.0945,5.9447,1.0795,0.0864,2.6881,1.3841,2.4862,6.8001,5.0893,4.0603,1.1478,1.3485,0.0002,0.5746,0.0022,0.0353,0.0002,4.0512,6.5225,0.0039,3.6912,3.7262,1.6246,1.1912,4.7651,1.7246,0.8505,0.424,0.6856,0.6606,2.6402,1.9094,2.2982,3.255,6.1342,1.9575,0.7732,0.3239,0.0002,1.0066,0.0017,0.0261,0.0002,3.5664,0.4748,1.6398,6.2141,0.1356,5.2081,1.0267,2.3119,1.744,2.3861,0.5028,0.6041,0.0857,0.0002,0.6711,0.0013,0.0237,0.0002,4.255,3.0865,5.3163,0.567,2.9881,0.9128,0.7601,2.5653,1.9921,5.4988,2.6203,0.8587,1.0642,1.4996,4.4116,5.925,1.3212,0.6927,1.7174,2.8104,0.8179,6.1956,2.0624,1.6621,4.5716,1.2046,3.3615,2.3142,0.1751,1.0425,3.6368,0.2316,1.8408,3.7759,1.9413,0.3555,0.9833,1.4004,3.7322,5.5057,3.4797,0.6368,0.8305,3.2684,1.8769,6.4291,0.2221,1.6527,2.8752,1.6082,3.1944,0.2221,3.3989,1.2251,1.7578,1.5065,1.819,4.2643,2.0571,0.2668,1.8232,4.4713,2.8362,3.5837,3.199,0.4812]}

The Black Snow.\n\nThe book The Kuroyuki Cataclysm (Bridget White & Co, 2011) is about the Kuroyuki Cataclysm of 1894. It is published by the Japanese publisher Shueisha.\n\nIn 1894, Kuroyuki, born in Yokohama, entered the Japan War for Self-Defense. He was the last surviving member of the Japanese crew of HMS Pemberton on the Japanese coast. He later joined the Japanese military wing, the Kokugikan Group. He had an interest in war and helped himself to books about Japan and Korea because his grandfather was a sailor. He was not only a great leader but one who has deep and long-term personal attachment to all parts of Japan. He was the first Japanese leader to be awarded the Japanese Purple Heart. He is also known for his generosity in the war. He was a very fond of his grandchildren. He was an active father to a number of long-time friends and relatives. He helped his mother become an active and devoted member of his community and he always loved telling her stories about the war and the war\u2019s aftermath. His sister was a Japanese woman.\n\nIn his home in Yokohama, Kuroyuki lived with his family almost all his life. He was active on and off duty in various capacities of the Japanese military. His father, when he was nine years old, would frequently return to Yokohama to pick up his grand-children and then leave the country by sea or land ferry to visit his grandparents at home. In the early 1970s, Kuroyuki went off to World War II on board the first batch of submarines of the Japanese submarine fleet.","token_len":364,"entropy":[9.063,1.3984,5.4211,5.0867,5.7755,2.8086,4.5224,1.8961,2.4014,1.4367,6.6562,5.9907,0.447,11.0749,4.2958,2.748,2.0396,2.3929,7.0739,8.5641,4.1789,1.8172,0.0933,2.1172,5.9074,5.5541,2.117,0.0162,0.0212,4.0987,0.057,2.9558,6.4803,6.2711,0.8467,7.4965,5.145,4.688,3.6355,3.9459,0.1974,1.8206,3.3663,1.2395,2.811,0.0318,0.0079,1.2993,0.0074,3.6844,3.1794,4.0341,1.1944,1.5143,1.1945,4.7778,0.613,3.1415,3.6473,1.0219,3.3111,0.2482,0.0014,1.0673,1.1282,0.0003,2.989,3.9816,0.239,0.4296,2.4729,0.0309,0.0037,3.3819,5.7343,1.3852,5.029,0.2251,0.0008,0.342,6.7684,0.8438,6.0761,5.208,3.8079,2.9996,0.2073,0.5673,1.082,1.0488,1.258,2.8034,3.0517,2.5467,1.2828,0.0144,0.5512,1.6303,6.2113,1.7744,5.376,5.3625,6.161,0.0328,4.7132,1.2122,3.7395,2.1169,0.6034,1.3589,4.7514,2.9169,0.3608,2.1868,4.2234,7.2514,2.0899,0.7423,8.3197,3.8233,2.5239,6.1874,1.0449,1.4922,3.9825,3.8716,4.4775,0.021,4.9434,1.5329,6.548,7.4461,0.2117,6.6269,2.5338,2.8204,1.754,4.8422,7.6812,2.9889,4.4725,1.4744,0.733,3.666,0.7576,1.4196,1.4758,4.3601,3.603,0.8076,2.1777,4.1752,1.4062,4.8487,3.5017,6.6781,7.4967,3.3779,4.6935,1.1126,3.9105,3.8536,5.7198,0.1063,5.0939,6.6178,0.015,1.271,0.4508,1.525,1.4394,2.5926,1.363,1.5986,3.3539,0.4472,2.2273,2.4696,0.2773,4.5209,5.2239,0.5835,0.9396,1.573,2.7698,1.8453,2.4894,1.6199,0.5548,6.1512,2.078,2.4161,2.5992,1.6389,1.8481,1.4907,2.4881,3.3847,5.9182,4.5262,2.7591,5.6683,1.3782,1.8756,1.3472,3.8114,2.557,6.9788,1.6027,2.4661,3.6808,0.0072,7.9923,0.0736,1.2486,1.464,1.4425,3.0186,0.6562,1.1952,5.5311,2.5277,3.3284,4.568,2.2505,3.0723,3.7493,3.4989,2.9208,0.0554,4.0252,3.2191,2.295,3.861,4.788,3.5541,7.5306,3.1474,0.7211,1.9996,1.8779,2.5116,2.0182,1.6062,3.1181,15.0822,7.5629,5.8029,3.1457,0.2087,2.9214,5.2888,2.3782,1.4681,4.3135,2.7071,2.0218,1.2101,0.0002,1.9454,2.9669,5.4369,2.8218,1.1342,0.0059,0.0005,0.2536,1.2844,0.016,0.0062,3.3904,1.7454,0.2371,2.1489,7.3553,2.5713,1.147,0.0803,0.3705,0.8503,1.4746,5.0693,3.9679,3.8819,0.0246,2.3757,1.7357,3.8052,3.5538,4.6255,0.8462,1.1365,1.5522,0.7932,2.434,2.6506,2.0416,6.4121,0.5771,0.3135,5.8075,0.5407,0.0145,0.1007,5.2298,4.6822,5.5497,0.7708,1.7173,0.0033,0.0005,0.6618,3.3956,0.2047,1.0409,7.3708,2.903,1.5977,1.8555,4.4206,3.4811,2.5303,4.2053,5.3215,2.2359,4.3684,2.2769,7.9062,1.6435,3.5945,0.578,2.6167,3.2724,1.1094,0.408,3.3433,2.0354,2.2059,3.9042,0.1882,0.2949,1.9832,0.0086,0.004,3.6245,4.1125,0.3507,7.4118,0.0144,0.2059,4.1658,3.7348,0.688,5.5683,7.5963,0.0076,3.9986,4.0303,0.2258,1.9218,3.4534,1.7516,0.8045]}

She'll probably try to kill me again as I'm only 7 so I'll be out on my own after that but there will be very little time to talk to her. She never asked me to stop making eye contact with her or take photos with her.

I had to sit down and play the music, then a few minutes later she said \"hey i think she's having a good night bae\" and me and my friends went off to bed while I had some sleep too.","token_len":364,"entropy":[5.2847,6.7294,11.848,10.8934,0.5632,0.1985,0.0825,1.4558,7.5514,11.8913,0.4147,1.5708,7.1955,4.3983,1.4214,8.8299,3.5074,0.0904,0.0816,1.5767,1.2459,5.6616,2.4662,3.0299,0.4099,1.0721,2.28,0.1725,7.5329,5.1341,9.1931,5.6874,1.6542,4.3938,7.223,2.4953,0.0577,3.4723,6.6019,2.1773,0.4475,0.876,3.3204,2.6668,4.9544,3.1931,4.8023,2.293,4.9405,0.0003,4.8654,5.5226,5.3914,0.9336,5.9768,2.5658,3.2373,5.1077,3.8321,6.184,8.765,3.5221,1.0706,0.8072,1.0457,1.0749,1.6929,2.9447,4.5935,1.761,3.032,3.632,2.2832,4.7575,6.503,2.9752,1.7947,3.1935,4.5092,4.6574,2.4231,7.18,5.5207,2.4231,2.4498,7.0786,0.5433,2.5767,7.6373,0.8411,2.0966,1.8098,4.3368,3.2884,0.1474,0.438,2.3386,3.1812,1.5846,4.3754,6.637,3.9643,5.7609,1.2773,2.113,1.2915,3.1859,0.4962,3.2671,3.8425,4.3862,1.3173,3.7065,2.887,4.3237,5.6535,3.4806,2.1863,5.1766,3.0299,4.381,0.4299,2.2513,0.5854,3.0017,4.7925,2.6815,1.0734,4.9018,5.6282,3.3765,1.329,2.3166,2.1878,4.3669,4.7552,1.7109,0.1724,5.403,1.9444,4.5393,4.6258,3.1285,0.3878,6.5686,0.6017,3.1384,1.3301,3.3831,1.2449,0.1747,1.1937,2.3007,4.5909,4.2692,0.8186,0.9592,3.4123,5.5991,5.114,0.0417,1.5229,0.1411,3.0476,4.5974,2.8804,2.0038,0.2091,1.6138,1.3142,2.4576,4.0896,0.533,5.4687,0.8702,0.6083,1.6335,4.2724,3.4162,3.2288,0.2108,1.7602,0.8632,2.1887,3.2298,1.2653,2.0377,0.0004,1.6545,1.5101,5.2595,3.3481,0.711,0.9767,4.7404,0.7252,0.713,5.404,1.8519,1.6754,4.6435,7.0103,0.3742,0.7504,1.0511,0.0002,5.3747,0.7606,1.7107,1.9986,2.6342,5.1866,6.7952,0.7973,1.8265,1.0642,2.6197,1.785,3.687,0.0984,5.1983,2.011,4.2726,2.948,4.9379,1.3627,5.2411,2.3455,2.7346,8.1731,1.8983,1.778,1.9118,1.5235,1.5427,3.0103,0.0007,2.2071,2.1534,2.88,3.1643,5.1674,0.8054,5.0632,6.1033,3.1168,1.0193,3.8789,9.2655,1.6592,0.0002,3.4581,1.9375,4.2596,3.364,4.3409,5.1062,5.5413,2.4821,5.7286,0.541,5.4971,6.1924,3.8215,4.1722,3.2633,3.9359,3.7934,5.4595,5.5402,2.6558,3.7101,3.422,7.3449,2.1533,5.0881,0.2696,1.8586,0.6365,2.0662,1.7555,1.8797,5.7871,3.1935,0.0175,1.2266,3.3138,0.104,1.8757,0.7909,3.1476,0.4585,1.9426,0.269,0.4713,2.2577,5.7905,1.9589,1.1483,7.4218,1.8244,1.3805,4.4981,0.7896,3.1349,5.8218,5.0393,2.0865,5.9578,2.7044,6.1619,1.7244,1.7755,4.3817,0.2854,0.253,0.8837,1.5284,3.7866,1.6471,4.7898,1.7837,1.1032,5.5429,2.5789,3.9756,2.4585,2.9968,5.0548,1.0802,0.7426,0.1422,0.8892,2.5419,2.499,3.8736,4.0453,3.8858,3.0787,0.8968,4.9219,0.8958,3.793,3.1425,6.0623,6.644,1.7365,0.6745,6.073,0.9536,2.4334,2.4726,2.6855,3.7188,0.4997,2.8325,6.294,2.3074,4.3178,3.5566,3.8562,5.7642,0.3973]}

You are one of the security objects.\n\nThe most interesting thing about the Halloween Night stories in a month is that they all have the exact same story, all of them have two main characters. It is pretty interesting.\n\nSo you know your story now \u2013 you can give us a reference.\n\nI can not do it without your help. If you want help, please, let me know.\n\nThis is one of my favourite websites and I enjoy every one of it. I can imagine all how fun it is to read about the stories and the events of this month. I had to create a little sketch of one of the characters to help to make it really difficult for you to see the others stories at a glance.\n\nWhat you should know about the characters in this short story?\n\nWe know that the characters are actually very powerful and are sometimes portrayed as a threat. The reason is because they don\u2019t want you to see that. They want something to give you the impression or just for fun.\n\nI hope this helps you to understand and enjoy Halloween night stories!\n\nSo what should I do?\n\nI suggest you read the stories in chronological order \u2013 make sure you have an alphabetical order as well because it might take a while to learn to write.

{"id":3426,"ended":true,"length":349,"text":"You wake up to total dark. All you can hear is a clock ticking...\nI woke up to a ticking clock as well, but a much stronger one.\nYeah, it might be the end of the cycle of time. There are quite a few stories from the 60s and 70s now regarding clocks ticking... I wonder what those people thought about it.   My understanding from a non-statistics perspective is that humans are quite susceptible to these clocks.\nI don't believe in that. Some people have weird dreams about clocks...some people have even weird experiences with them. I think the issue with this is that we often underestimate them and it isn't always as scary.  If your dream wasn't so powerful you would have noticed a certain time shift in your body.\n> a certain time shift in your body  This is why I don't go to sleep (I slept with my husband) because it takes forever to sleep, even more so in my dreams I've been dreaming about that day before.\nJust a few nights ago or tonight?  I have lucid dream and I wake up to wake up before 7, but I have been dreaming for hours (I woke up at 7, I went to bed at 7 PM I woke early and still woke up after 5).\nMaybe it's related to the fact that I'm aware of those shifts being super early, right after they start happening? Then I just use my subconscious for that... I don't do this with anything else.\nYeah I don't think the clock was necessarily a big deal. It's more that I think in my dreams I wake up to a ton of time shift in my body. They're really intense, it takes too long to wake up so it takes a lot of energy to wake up.","token_len":365,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,3.4797,10.2946,6.7631,4.2421,5.1299,2.6087,1.7629,3.3357,0.32,2.5803,8.0826,1.0937,5.5948,2.5146,6.2322,5.4619,0.0324,0.5405,2.1611,6.122,0.2797,5.9155,2.4654,2.3507,2.5805,5.0897,6.353,4.6598,1.2057,0.8018,1.4432,5.8482,0.5026,2.1558,5.7375,0.7505,2.5924,4.8052,0.3242,0.7208,6.8017,4.1977,2.6759,0.9013,5.0027,2.0974,6.2905,0.0576,0.1646,5.0828,4.2638,1.4162,8.2006,1.0554,0.9543,0.3938,0.0038,6.1166,6.0265,6.0598,2.9026,3.5051,3.3886,4.0419,1.2926,3.9982,3.2555,1.455,2.1224,1.5417,0.8374,6.6226,6.0645,6.6254,6.7977,4.8172,3.6413,6.8764,0.3338,6.3001,2.2658,1.6423,0.4116,0.1975,5.6501,1.9511,3.5444,4.6774,0.035,3.1151,2.132,1.0492,2.5179,2.2493,2.6133,0.001,3.5951,2.3199,5.1743,1.2076,5.6836,1.0242,2.6414,6.8976,2.5393,2.401,1.9982,3.364,7.5442,1.0968,1.3278,4.2867,6.1537,5.2115,1.6266,1.2668,0.387,1.9938,2.1561,2.5202,6.2653,1.9903,2.8513,0.6604,0.2819,2.6422,4.5295,6.2425,4.5787,2.3428,3.9928,5.1285,0.0008,2.8171,3.6792,4.3363,2.6802,2.518,5.514,4.4095,3.1388,6.6066,0.0004,2.494,5.7084,2.83,1.9299,1.6367,4.3822,3.1519,5.1576,3.9134,5.6197,2.7146,0.5979,2.3513,1.4392,1.9868,8.8879,7.0607,4.3954,1.0882,0.1525,0.5022,0.0746,0.0087,5.7028,6.0899,0.8608,2.9156,1.5608,2.5827,0.0007,5.7167,1.2252,0.7972,6.0461,2.3018,6.2564,4.1771,1.2391,4.4753,2.6529,2.351,2.2938,4.5811,3.9499,0.7176,5.4845,2.6117,3.8938,5.6628,0.3884,3.251,2.5802,2.314,4.0791,4.1344,1.6185,1.5892,1.0713,3.854,3.5266,4.6213,0.8717,1.5827,5.7391,2.9372,2.335,5.2595,0.2749,7.9053,7.9158,3.114,2.0951,1.5081,3.7426,7.6606,3.3178,2.6512,1.3383,3.3925,0.0309,1.4426,6.3648,0.104,6.4123,4.4961,4.762,2.9155,1.1655,3.0218,3.2996,0.7753,2.5862,3.1834,4.7799,1.9327,3.1504,0.0384,2.7907,1.7436,2.4762,2.1908,3.7272,0.3839,0.9798,0.9565,1.0395,9.1471,5.7966,1.1663,8.6323,2.2422,5.4231,1.5009,0.2233,3.7276,3.7776,3.5287,1.1825,4.7316,1.8554,0.6132,5.7613,0.1346,1.4827,2.0071,0.0519,1.6042,1.9198,5.734,0.5698,5.8674,6.7336,5.3222,6.6765,4.9437,1.8283,5.5661,3.6901,4.6384,3.0042,2.9832,2.3441,6.539,1.4176,4.1794,5.8364,1.3072,4.1802,4.3704,2.7354,4.2696,2.5339,1.7888,0.0005,4.3918,3.0321,3.9391,3.5833,1.9615,0.7725,1.1167,4.7619,3.2168,2.7911,0.0005,1.9218,3.877,3.3504,3.3924,6.7935,2.5174,3.1048,0.4202,1.6039,1.8707,1.2352,3.0774,3.1931,1.3271,2.9601,5.3675,1.6983,2.7227,1.2199,3.5328,0.0204,1.9114,2.0101,7.212,0.1905,2.6539,4.1807,3.0636,0.2823,0.2203,1.0308,6.0784,1.6864,3.9932,6.0278,1.742,3.2568,3.1459,5.1675,0.515,0.7413,1.0893,0.0934,4.9915,2.0421,2.905,1.4769,1.3501,0.8009,2.5031,0.5527,1.4606,0.106,1.062]}

{"id":2874,"ended":true,"length":357,"text":"With a new technology that converts one very basic human emotion into energy, the energy crisis seems solved. Until one day the very huge flaw comes to light.\n\nThe most basic human emotion is energy. Once our hearts are used to control what is happening around us, we will always be using energy as an emotional tool for control, manipulation, and control through the use of any number of tools for those of us who are capable of feeling and expressing the emotions we share. Whether through energy, love, loss, anger, pain, anxiety, and more, the emotions we use are not only internal but ultimately external due to the nature of our experience.\n\nSo the energy crisis, even though it is a human emotion, has very little to do with the nature of our emotions. It may be difficult to create an emotional experience with certain emotions \u2014 you may choose to think about a scene from a movie that doesn't involve humans but is instead focused on the person (or animals) in question or the world around you. The reason is because we don\u2019t want to live life that way. We want to live life that reflects or values relationships well.\n\nOur emotions are not purely human. They are external, and in many cases, not just external. Our emotions exist in the heart, mind, and spirit. However, they are still an emotional tool that we use because it provides a connection between the two. They can bring peace out of a situation, bring peace to a situation, allow us to be present when needed, or allow us to be able to feel and express the emotions we share that we share with each other.\n\nUnderstanding the emotions used in this energy crisis makes it clear that the way we use energy, and how we use it, can influence our behavior and future choices.","token_len":366,"entropy":[2.9505,4.7193,6.4868,2.5114,5.9232,5.7152,8.0902,3.6468,4.8025,3.7473,0.0847,7.2201,0.5758,2.1339,4.6392,8.1614,5.7222,8.4761,0.3506,6.8859,5.6577,1.3723,2.8259,6.077,10.2712,6.1135,7.2457,1.3035,0.1858,1.1616,0.9607,0.0036,2.2623,4.7539,3.6751,2.2761,0.2264,0.7989,4.8289,0.5526,5.9232,5.0581,4.0554,1.3085,5.4049,0.4329,6.2138,4.4202,2.0778,0.8244,1.1645,0.1952,0.2107,1.331,2.8367,4.4515,1.1725,4.3652,1.9546,2.405,2.9691,4.8372,2.1239,3.5905,3.1283,2.6019,4.3401,0.7525,0.9354,0.9163,5.3613,2.4817,1.8738,0.018,4.8301,2.9832,0.0031,3.6662,5.3723,5.3011,3.0474,0.0281,0.739,1.4342,4.3406,0.2494,4.619,2.648,4.2297,2.9081,1.2195,1.4908,4.8964,0.6916,5.8456,4.1739,5.0709,1.8961,4.434,0.1265,7.3831,0.1217,2.3928,0.0858,4.0484,0.0894,4.616,0.0934,3.84,3.4734,0.778,2.5872,3.4996,0.7729,3.8796,1.7078,3.2504,2.6997,7.8041,1.4377,5.7127,2.9061,7.6636,0.0094,1.3802,3.8246,0.03,0.8112,5.5268,1.2683,0.8997,0.0001,4.2247,3.6373,3.0933,0.2184,3.686,4.5382,1.4446,0.3293,1.3495,2.1173,4.2152,1.435,0.2257,2.5246,5.3815,0.9144,0.2619,0.0111,0.003,1.6433,3.7312,0.0656,0.9498,2.3142,0.5924,1.3646,4.8274,0.7702,6.4068,0.3827,6.2929,2.3498,1.0512,4.2895,3.1011,5.9906,1.0858,6.4029,5.1969,0.3659,6.0259,0.4632,4.5754,1.5844,3.0774,5.6119,2.1074,0.9145,0.6445,3.8187,3.547,0.0014,2.096,5.722,3.2091,3.0675,3.0514,3.9237,0.2016,1.9207,5.0317,5.4826,1.3751,3.2936,0.5236,1.7874,1.7338,4.5948,2.06,2.9929,0.561,2.0805,0.4678,2.9248,4.8386,2.3757,2.3376,2.5318,2.8053,15.3407,8.4219,0.7238,2.4708,0.3465,5.4366,4.5403,4.9416,1.1189,0.4603,1.6419,0.7457,0.2184,1.5343,2.0724,0.9262,6.8584,6.3857,6.147,6.7665,6.6308,1.5677,1.3006,0.0001,4.5823,1.7941,0.9737,1.8569,6.1568,4.1901,0.907,1.5291,0.6884,6.4569,2.2793,1.8508,4.1516,2.0596,1.1004,1.4081,3.7254,2.3063,3.8713,1.1109,3.8007,0.8074,5.5999,1.369,2.0351,5.3392,1.1929,3.6108,0.0478,0.8345,2.5042,1.3382,4.6383,0.0419,2.2052,0.8937,5.3839,4.5705,1.8501,1.3928,2.2596,1.4057,0.4883,4.6241,3.205,4.0512,1.8192,5.6742,1.6651,1.8076,2.4402,0.6063,3.8357,2.6675,4.7259,4.9164,7.527,0.0469,1.7861,1.8313,1.0644,3.5538,1.9487,1.8387,0.6021,1.3123,0.1735,5.3315,0.8181,0.0555,2.9637,3.3892,2.9983,3.8345,0.2296,1.6891,2.9692,0.1755,0.0387,1.7001,4.0508,0.0058,2.9962,2.2138,0.412,1.8813,0.5823,0.8636,0.2457,5.9922,1.4582,1.1489,1.2998,2.6838,0.0348,0.2456,0.5773,0.0001,5.8096,1.125,3.9012,5.2101,1.0528,2.449,5.0626,0.013,4.86,0.6825,2.3332,0.3877,2.0936,3.9311,0.7406,0.9654,1.1173,3.7779,1.9183,1.5483,0.2447,0.8901,0.9403,0.6707,2.4549,4.3933,1.26,3.1081,1.2569,6.0017,3.511,0.3307]}

Here are a few ways you can create a world in which you can be an expert at creating games for Death (or at least someone who can challenge Death), without becoming overwhelmed with ideas and ideas.\n\n2. Create a set of rules that will guide death, if Death and all of his people have ever lived.\n\nIn order to create a world where you\u2019re the dominant ruler of the world, there are important rules and rules to be followed as well. If your favorite people have died, you must create rules and rules to provide that protection. Most often, a set of rules will guide the final decision, but there are many rules you may not choose that will help in helping you through your period of life.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to live life that way, with your favorite characters and their favorite characters. For example, if you don\u2019t like to die and your love for Death goes wild, you may want to start your own business. A game that allows you to create a game that can challenge Death and their people will benefit greatly from it.\n\n3. Create a game that can challenge Death and protect both himself and his loved ones.\n\nMany games use combat game mechanics that can allow for different ways of playing death to challenge Death. A combat game could use a mechanic that lets the players create their own rules that guide Death in order to defeat Death. A combat game would allow the player to create their own rules while not having any of their loved ones die while trying to defeat Death.","token_len":366,"entropy":[7.7667,5.7112,11.2439,1.6256,3.4119,2.7653,1.558,7.1595,6.0556,3.0238,0.2127,4.458,1.7467,1.5175,7.2839,11.7012,3.3171,6.5586,5.0501,0.751,2.9769,0.542,1.7453,0.0018,2.5451,5.0674,3.2985,1.9461,0.2952,7.3592,0.8018,0.8502,0.818,4.3004,1.0149,3.0218,1.0602,3.456,3.4788,3.8366,2.6628,4.3872,3.8074,3.4021,2.1197,0.958,0.6456,4.2209,2.5423,0.4244,5.8614,1.1994,1.8277,0.1056,3.0559,1.6293,0.0826,2.2729,0.5827,4.4302,3.5479,0.7887,1.1641,0.6385,3.9739,4.2147,3.3494,1.8587,1.9077,2.1314,3.5648,1.3877,4.5221,2.1654,2.7913,0.0528,5.2175,0.4044,1.7674,3.4847,0.8798,3.9219,5.3251,5.2491,5.7187,1.6614,5.5757,1.2918,3.4412,1.6417,0.2477,0.0001,5.1669,0.3624,1.4259,0.7311,6.4041,0.1354,1.2977,1.8813,2.6585,3.8771,6.482,3.2547,5.7888,4.0558,4.137,3.8792,1.887,1.0153,1.6152,3.1615,5.2565,2.3178,0.6952,0.558,0.0002,3.4884,2.7332,0.1346,0.9199,0.3018,1.9147,1.9872,2.3861,19.9429,8.0097,4.839,3.0574,6.2349,3.8771,0.9795,1.2752,0.9502,0.3964,3.7383,1.0955,6.5168,0.4854,3.793,1.0344,2.4089,2.9665,0.345,4.2787,2.3781,0.5354,3.4753,3.181,7.4875,5.3088,1.6207,2.7883,0.7492,1.2861,2.2662,3.1606,3.2962,3.2964,0.3483,1.3942,5.8483,3.1825,6.28,0.9662,5.8123,4.7797,0.595,3.0649,2.4425,0.0239,0.1613,1.3255,3.0603,2.0531,5.3739,2.6511,2.4825,1.3738,2.3223,0.3125,2.4903,1.5932,2.4925,2.8823,1.6188,6.2437,5.3174,1.1924,2.2135,4.1804,5.1919,1.4087,6.5251,2.1156,8.7471,0.4711,3.5448,0.3231,0.4983,0.0002,3.6316,3.8958,3.0543,0.7626,0.0242,1.168,0.0655,5.4502,5.4116,6.7119,1.2908,1.5299,6.5034,2.3061,4.3136,3.2768,1.5485,3.5943,5.4954,2.8198,1.5536,4.395,0.7728,0.0379,1.4995,0.4283,3.6088,0.0824,0.111,0.0808,1.8403,3.1973,2.7019,2.4526,1.9701,5.1951,1.0795,1.6867,4.4994,6.2881,0.2631,0.6636,1.2565,1.2361,0.0694,4.3373,3.6841,1.5159,4.7951,1.7547,4.0309,3.0654,1.5263,3.0467,0.1816,0.0437,1.5727,1.0729,2.6813,1.1049,3.0486,2.8607,0.5397,1.6349,5.311,0.6238,2.0481,4.7472,4.3114,0.2534,3.0566,0.1984,0.2487,0.0001,0.3284,0.0009,0.6089,0.5113,2.2582,0.931,2.5426,1.4616,0.4853,1.2311,6.644,6.7813,4.7061,0.0193,0.7214,3.9985,0.0083,0.2314,0.0391,0.0001,3.9281,1.4038,4.0104,6.5467,7.1944,1.3066,1.736,3.0759,3.5872,1.8948,4.1302,3.1645,1.2124,1.9723,4.2836,5.1322,4.8526,1.3142,0.865,3.4672,2.9686,0.0844,4.4003,3.9461,1.6866,4.1094,0.6086,2.9978,2.8557,3.4571,3.9031,2.861,0.065,2.6147,1.8415,5.3456,0.9466,3.7495,3.445,0.0154,3.1558,1.5138,1.2251,1.8742,1.2569,0.027,3.1301,2.1128,1.0119,1.1879,0.0774,1.7125,1.3459,0.0244,0.295,5.9425,4.0647,2.2657,4.4822,2.8161,2.0778,2.4812,0.0114,0.6372,4.2347,3.4107,0.0413,1.7968,0.6263,0.2215]}

Stop smoking now, and stop wasting time.\n\nThere is much to be said about the history of cigarette bans, and its meaning. Here are a few good-hearted, if small, ones. \"A good cigarette ban lasts only for an entire decade; the most expensive tobacco products end the lifetime ban; the most common form of tobacco is the single most common form of tobacco.\" (John Deere, The Tobacco Age, 1787, 3). \"Smoking has only two effects.

All that is needed is that our governments use that logic and reason all the time to create a plan for how to get that plan started.\n\nYou can think, or you can only think logically, that government will be ok with you and your government, but that doesn't mean that government will be okay with the plan. The government doesn't have as much power as you think it does, because it doesn't have the power to use the government. So you can't really argue that this is going to happen.\n\nThat being said... this could be really interesting... I agree with everyone else that the plan is completely plausible and probably the right thing to do (most especially if the plans are the right ones), but again, I think the government is going to have to be absolutely damned sure this is going to happen, and most likely this isn't going to happen anyway.","token_len":367,"entropy":[8.7224,1.342,2.1568,7.8331,2.0317,2.4708,3.7179,1.5456,1.4961,2.0603,6.9842,1.5658,4.7675,1.3977,1.0036,3.5108,1.8338,2.2902,4.1943,1.0479,1.1681,1.8659,0.7049,2.5586,0.0082,1.9593,1.7131,0.8788,1.0693,0.9429,0.1235,0.0028,0.0282,0.0617,0.0501,0.0048,0.0195,0.0024,0.0035,0.0084,0.0041,0.0016,0.0033,0.001,0.0018,0.0077,0.001,0.0015,0.0007,3.2862,0.0002,6.0875,1.9976,4.6671,2.9839,1.5178,4.0519,3.826,3.8175,2.7936,3.8136,1.384,3.664,3.1223,5.0042,1.6177,3.3463,3.3458,1.1098,2.6734,2.7366,2.4326,0.2572,2.9364,4.7513,2.9325,0.3904,0.2969,0.9317,5.8552,0.0781,4.7252,0.0872,2.5058,1.1925,3.794,2.6446,4.9279,1.7817,3.5834,0.2311,3.9655,0.1735,4.2483,7.116,0.5816,3.5965,0.6596,5.1352,3.2415,0.5815,0.3349,1.5905,0.0002,4.0241,1.9927,2.2165,5.2875,3.5172,2.1086,3.2552,0.0195,5.3285,3.8255,3.2554,0.8952,6.2324,4.0035,0.6275,5.9816,1.9674,0.352,4.3054,4.4436,3.575,1.8075,1.8245,6.8107,1.7696,2.7438,0.5787,0.6681,2.6302,2.1286,1.5233,1.0651,1.5082,0.0382,1.1621,0.0756,0.9564,0.6895,0.195,1.6442,0.1835,0.4174,0.1229,0.2571,0.1346,0.3248,0.0002,3.9507,5.4222,5.2448,4.8292,2.7909,1.0876,2.7619,4.4181,0.3396,5.2354,1.2859,0.6127,5.3043,1.844,1.7357,2.5556,4.9632,4.9256,4.2183,2.8689,3.1159,0.4079,0.3624,1.7442,0.2147,8.1044,2.7339,2.5115,3.4185,2.2236,1.0105,3.4639,1.5227,0.0016,6.8885,0.5739,5.2017,2.4975,1.8684,2.2509,0.404,2.4484,5.2396,6.2748,5.3573,4.3343,3.5226,1.8633,4.1377,5.9037,0.2438,0.0175,1.7706,3.9759,1.704,3.5401,2.7197,3.3987,0.7369,2.9425,5.6221,2.9303,4.0844,0.3022,0.5697,0.0003,3.9676,1.4307,4.4758,5.1262,4.4822,1.5421,0.0967,4.2177,0.5813,5.3697,1.3095,2.0377,7.1183,2.6107,2.6893,6.5466,1.0472,3.8503,3.8415,2.7201,3.12,4.384,1.6455,2.3631,1.9339,0.0005,0.4678,0.9827,2.4333,0.6775,1.184,1.7487,0.0118,3.3864,4.2445,0.9738,2.6945,1.6716,3.7167,0.0006,1.2423,7.8418,0.2141,1.883,0.7521,2.0906,1.4518,1.3321,0.6715,1.2245,3.4061,1.3315,2.1743,0.0004,0.5309,1.3188,1.3109,0.3735,5.133,2.0562,3.4429,2.3441,3.4331,2.577,1.2766,1.2722,2.9764,2.9993,0.7398,4.124,0.6232,3.2821,0.0236,2.3032,1.144,0.6429,0.0002,3.9623,4.439,0.0321,5.5201,3.8532,5.01,1.1675,4.1239,2.4891,3.9389,3.1843,6.2212,0.795,3.9945,2.938,1.2261,1.8837,3.1474,1.0235,5.6222,5.5021,1.975,4.6119,2.9615,5.0056,1.3447,0.1346,0.158,5.1919,5.9988,6.9775,1.3484,2.0468,5.4793,0.7579,4.8148,1.0673,1.1255,2.5825,0.2612,6.8077,0.5546,1.4923,1.3322,1.8278,2.6214,1.4551,1.972,0.0216,1.6328,0.4187,2.0853,4.9758,6.7999,3.3004,4.8946,0.8968,0.7725,0.0025,0.4612,2.4375,1.2093,5.6819,0.6742,3.7755,3.1804,0.0003,0.2813,0.004,1.1335,4.0883,0.3278]}

Make me cry.\n\nThe book is a collection of 25 books, most of them written by an 11-year-old English teacher, who wrote a few words about his first-name, first-last name and first name. He did not tell anyone he did this; he gave up writing and moved on.\n\nIn his autobiography, Mr. Smith writes that he would make jokes about how the teacher kept up on his homework.\n\nHis son told one teacher: \"In my life I always believed that boys had names and had parents, but the teacher who had the most attention because everything was in English language. That was not the case. Our first names were pronounced backwards and forward at a school, we were called by a third person to the teacher's first name, but I did not know the first person and that is why I did not have a name. The teacher said to me, 'You must learn how to pronounce that name, because your name is my first.' In my first name I have first- and last-name, and you must learn the second-name and the third-name. Our names are English, so we do not have as long a name as our first names, because we have learned how to pronounce it, although this cannot teach you that one name. To learn both one name and one of the many other names, you need five people who understand the other one very well.\"\n\nHe had to make up that name five times, then a third person was called to explain the confusion and explained again that it was the name of the teacher. A teacher said afterwards that this was not such a big deal.\n\nMr. Smith said he had spent the last three years writing essays on what came next.","token_len":367,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,2.0279,2.3894,7.2874,2.3364,1.1851,3.3276,4.9297,6.9186,5.0296,0.6346,1.8917,0.0079,3.466,5.3248,1.4715,2.1786,3.7547,0.019,6.476,3.4928,1.8671,4.3659,0.2522,0.7081,2.6298,0.6605,4.961,5.9971,0.1317,0.0453,0.1016,0.0012,5.8047,2.3495,2.4224,2.4505,3.6316,2.3249,4.0287,3.5646,2.237,1.2228,5.2227,4.1676,5.4706,1.6944,2.8929,0.3543,3.8996,0.2895,1.134,1.5304,1.4965,2.3127,2.1183,4.5238,1.1598,3.8277,2.5677,3.2142,4.7075,1.3775,4.8311,0.9184,4.3549,4.7452,3.3023,2.7798,3.0256,1.9653,0.9637,1.0198,0.0002,3.5534,2.4375,4.1006,0.2117,3.1783,0.2459,4.3492,2.379,1.3233,0.6388,5.2564,4.9494,3.675,0.6189,3.0438,3.127,3.2759,4.6931,5.3788,4.7341,1.0601,4.0746,1.5734,1.878,0.0003,4.085,3.1796,2.7782,5.8529,1.4921,3.1162,0.0667,5.6244,2.4716,3.3628,1.6712,3.4338,6.2446,1.2399,5.2169,3.6743,5.8693,1.8329,4.8062,4.7425,2.0593,1.4537,3.7758,1.8409,5.3493,3.4773,1.9512,2.1511,4.5339,6.1023,7.4738,0.8848,3.7891,3.0674,5.621,3.1291,3.4445,1.6915,3.4314,2.0447,0.3734,1.2077,5.7509,3.8251,2.2733,0.7379,5.4126,6.0239,1.5947,4.5005,5.0543,3.1643,5.6153,2.2214,5.3345,2.2666,2.2071,3.4476,2.6382,4.0963,2.5668,5.1088,1.9795,4.0637,2.1022,4.4575,0.0597,1.6514,2.9582,3.3102,3.3167,0.1079,1.8972,2.6668,2.0082,2.5226,3.7392,3.8526,2.301,1.0619,0.8278,1.5894,0.0635,3.469,1.2932,1.8893,1.3193,3.1928,0.9537,3.286,2.3995,0.3813,0.7117,0.1282,1.7166,2.8422,3.9392,2.5777,0.0533,1.6698,3.2533,1.1111,2.1507,2.004,3.4236,2.4843,0.9332,4.5776,1.5843,2.9462,5.382,1.5195,2.9269,1.9203,1.0906,3.6966,5.8698,2.2396,3.7069,0.8049,0.7526,0.3621,1.5577,1.456,3.7921,1.0403,0.4332,3.0627,2.5232,3.1593,2.0845,1.8339,1.4775,0.417,0.1482,0.0172,1.4489,6.5628,3.0284,0.8767,6.0279,1.8394,2.5435,2.5959,3.1814,0.1013,0.7989,7.2434,5.5689,1.3082,2.4053,0.3925,2.5099,1.3622,0.5001,2.0913,2.7599,1.5228,1.9259,5.4094,1.6154,0.0399,0.5261,2.8581,3.0673,6.5431,4.9837,5.7099,5.901,1.859,4.0536,4.3037,2.3208,2.2457,5.5412,2.1423,6.6122,5.8355,2.0506,0.0551,1.6734,4.6666,1.0047,4.9586,1.5123,0.4605,1.1365,0.9794,3.1126,6.4248,5.05,3.1296,3.0599,2.0298,4.0853,3.3688,5.2079,0.0561,1.4821,0.1074,0.0002,2.74,4.1612,2.3712,4.0616,2.1672,4.5721,2.6108,5.59,0.354,1.7376,4.189,4.7692,1.3064,0.7332,4.0371,1.5185,1.3841,4.1285,1.7749,5.3909,2.3492,5.7563,6.9568,4.3092,2.1767,0.2867,2.072,4.2474,0.3908,1.3326,1.3646,1.1058,4.796,3.9719,3.5737,8.0126,1.5975,3.7008,0.9692,1.8195,6.6951,0.2141,2.0317,0.4379,1.2428,0.655,0.0002,1.7583,0.0014,0.0975,2.3804,0.9822,2.026,5.4334,2.3661,1.3395,2.4467,0.3359,2.6661,5.8782,1.426,4.1117,6.1914,1.6217,1.0322]}

Don't go on adventures without ending it by ending the story by following steps 2-5.","token_len":368,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,6.9577,4.4342,4.8775,4.1758,7.3071,5.0673,1.1056,6.698,2.5894,0.2972,1.8531,4.3948,2.3401,2.7691,6.2841,4.3242,5.0335,3.1987,1.0231,3.6272,5.1732,4.3422,1.3253,0.0044,5.0145,0.5391,5.5736,3.7533,2.5564,4.6981,1.0375,5.414,6.0367,2.0356,2.8032,3.6259,1.7585,3.089,3.6932,1.1999,2.8184,5.0711,3.091,6.2568,0.6695,3.6979,0.5609,1.1118,4.498,0.3047,2.5807,1.1413,1.6571,2.2322,2.8241,1.3674,0.6752,2.4898,0.2259,0.5343,3.7097,4.9815,0.8733,3.0494,4.4929,3.0544,2.3441,0.2221,0.4339,5.4002,4.0407,1.2797,4.3549,1.0506,2.9254,3.7212,0.142,1.941,3.0981,0.7531,1.8286,0.1529,0.2953,2.6422,0.82,3.0131,5.489,1.9923,0.3761,1.3627,1.6011,0.1541,0.2339,2.624,0.7467,0.9596,6.432,0.0326,2.6062,0.9357,0.6922,0.9681,0.0002,0.2132,0.001,2.5988,5.4835,0.3154,6.0934,1.1659,0.0304,3.3286,0.4009,1.5373,4.3647,5.2075,0.0896,5.1083,2.2249,0.6942,8.1239,2.8455,0.0079,2.9286,6.3974,1.7823,2.9898,3.5131,1.6514,0.9563,4.4813,3.4078,3.7168,3.4267,0.0029,1.9195,0.286,0.7362,1.2498,0.7837,1.1495,0.2454,1.3463,4.2013,1.4858,5.4563,4.3962,2.6882,4.4104,4.7048,5.4541,0.1333,3.9005,3.9472,0.7074,1.1561,1.1037,0.2633,5.4084,2.7405,3.1718,3.7139,6.201,2.0754,0.8393,0.5577,4.8714,1.6858,6.4661,5.4145,2.3613,0.2317,0.9549,3.0184,6.5995,0.9729,0.0203,0.2524,1.5747,2.3179,2.6104,3.2284,1.1075,1.8533,5.632,4.2296,3.1487,0.1364,0.1683,3.6147,1.4884,3.7152,1.0698,1.4607,1.3544,4.8013,2.4775,0.811,1.9132,5.149,6.6123,1.1129,4.3063,0.1998,0.4868,4.1986,3.3365,6.4619,0.0213,4.5158,6.3329,4.9319,3.2858,1.0176,1.3063,5.4103,6.3311,4.5088,3.9252,2.1505,6.6585,0.9248,6.258,0.4351,5.6561,2.2081,3.1627,2.4053,2.9261,1.483,4.7313,2.9263,0.8008,5.6092,3.6019,1.5217,3.894,5.0431,0.0005,2.9641,8.5865,0.0003,0.5801,0.0021,2.6925,0.0012,4.8415,3.798,0.4795,1.0499,1.0523,5.0355,2.0872,4.5521,0.7361,2.5233,0.0003,3.6442,2.4975,0.3678,7.8513,0.5975,4.4407,4.5499,5.2889,7.3677,2.3688,2.9941,3.3762,7.3729,2.2549,3.7038,1.3733,2.3041,4.2822,1.3911,4.6884,1.2674,6.4154,2.0563,1.9164,5.3038,1.9363,1.5663,4.1892,2.2512,1.901,0.0568,0.0021,4.4791,4.4628,3.4197,1.7718,0.7335,1.3181,4.0933,1.4162,5.2635,0.2633,0.4176,1.0158,0.0003,0.1671,0.001,5.8283,1.4889,3.3464,4.9529,1.0127,3.9905,2.8431,2.6346,1.3335,3.0387,0.0002,1.0604,4.7645,2.7685,3.8953,0.5448,2.3737,0.2842,3.6916,1.3213,0.2566,4.4802,3.1393,0.3628,1.8528,1.4937,0.0003,5.1098,0.0018,1.4813,0.0003,1.706,4.5296,3.4063,0.8782,0.5915,4.5301,1.7158,0.6296,4.1247,3.8682,3.5056,1.8024,0.0004,4.5363,2.9229,4.529,2.2463,2.5861,2.4221,2.2635,4.6071,1.3675,0.3441,2.3838,7.4849,6.5219,2.7402,1.4866,1.6473,0.5053]}

She said to him, \"No, you can move out here, you come to me.\" He went further than that and told her that they didn't know where she was because he is too old and that she was in her own world. He was right, all the things in her world must be \"natural\"!\n\nSo, he gave her where she lived, and she could move in, but she had to leave the house and he didn't tell her where she lived. He left her where she lived. She had to leave her home as well. He went back home and told her that she would have to go back, and at that moment, he turned into a giant and showed her where she lived.

{"id":4792,"ended":true,"length":360,"text":"Marriage means tethering your mind to your spouse's so you share minds. One of you dies, but the tether hasn't disconnected. So one of you dies, but the tether doesn't have a separate's'.\n\nSo what about the marriage proposal? If a two year divorce means no-one, the marriage is only about \"filling the soul\"  for those of us who are so close to our spouse. If a wife says \"I want to see my husband\" instead of \"I want to see my husband\" if the marriage is not about \"filling the soul\" for those of us who are only closer to our spouse (i.e. the spouse who had the heartbreak because his partner broke him as a result), then he may really be wrong to be mad at her. That might be true, but perhaps it won't be true for you, so please be prepared to be completely alone :)\n\nI understand your confusion. For many marriages where the marriage may have been more than one person, I would say that we are closer than the spouses and that you can spend a good lot of time together, but I would also say that you and your spouse can work together as a team to make this happen. It is only the couple that truly loves each other. I mean... it might make less sense for you to spend a lot of time working at weddings, but that is really not the point. If you want to work together and make things work... then I think you need to talk to each other. But to me, at the end of the day (like we all do), the wife orhusband are the one in charge of making sure the couple is happy and that they continue to enjoy each other despite their differences (though that is a matter of personal preference, I suppose).","token_len":370,"entropy":[9.7447,7.7675,16.8353,0.0423,2.5289,5.2967,0.4535,1.6972,2.181,2.3182,8.6207,1.721,7.7905,11.554,2.4782,5.6563,1.144,7.626,8.2357,1.6162,3.6332,1.4256,8.6101,8.3557,0.0005,7.7708,1.1726,4.0409,4.6851,1.4162,0.0794,2.5868,1.1047,0.6606,0.8261,0.868,1.9412,0.0003,3.769,2.8779,5.5442,9.1829,10.3975,1.3992,0.0114,3.3686,2.845,3.1466,1.867,3.6465,6.1234,0.7517,3.4748,3.0745,5.8513,3.0716,6.3534,5.2796,3.593,6.5204,0.2659,5.1837,3.4374,1.5809,3.0842,4.6033,3.5069,5.8351,5.3971,4.0165,1.4072,6.9109,1.3005,9.4523,8.1422,3.8132,3.3759,0.8073,0.4133,1.9626,5.9117,2.8773,1.2354,1.2239,1.2411,1.0756,2.4588,1.3983,4.6954,4.2744,1.9778,0.9994,1.8162,0.7088,3.709,2.066,1.231,3.0614,5.1465,0.2838,0.5809,0.3345,0.2245,0.2625,0.645,0.6938,0.4289,2.2365,5.675,2.6441,1.5318,1.2889,3.4962,0.998,1.3967,0.4055,0.0067,0.0317,0.0304,1.0439,2.1243,0.6452,0.1491,0.0251,0.1206,0.3092,6.4721,4.9919,0.4365,0.4638,0.3352,3.6514,2.6873,0.0027,0.0005,0.371,2.9068,2.7123,0.7412,5.0373,1.8609,5.4399,2.2846,4.5159,4.7507,2.9091,4.3152,5.1851,5.9841,0.6055,2.297,2.6517,0.7107,3.0772,3.6233,6.5246,1.1825,5.4214,3.248,3.9212,6.8808,0.7655,1.6259,1.2314,4.0592,4.4365,1.0525,2.8078,1.7795,0.2503,5.8497,1.7549,4.0691,0.0004,0.5029,1.0784,1.8103,3.8364,2.5482,3.5946,3.9215,3.0736,3.9807,0.7088,2.4494,5.6994,6.7893,8.7184,0.4976,0.0004,3.3604,4.2907,3.7656,4.874,1.2816,4.8366,3.2516,4.1928,4.2144,1.3818,2.3538,5.9106,2.2142,1.0789,4.2177,2.5863,2.2149,2.6166,0.4631,3.5943,2.2831,2.1941,1.0741,4.4944,1.7418,4.3606,1.074,3.2947,3.3907,3.3969,2.0083,4.1396,3.0212,7.0512,2.4959,3.3266,5.6578,0.1248,0.0839,1.5594,2.4418,1.7871,2.3927,2.1493,1.197,0.6458,0.1839,1.9151,5.589,0.7266,0.5015,2.8138,4.789,1.2208,3.7226,1.0276,1.5,2.3543,2.4681,3.4187,1.5222,0.4503,3.1331,1.4261,4.2934,3.6455,3.1491,1.9233,3.9962,3.4682,0.5763,0.0085,1.6983,2.9323,4.569,5.0633,3.0425,4.1998,4.363,6.8634,0.1531,1.4901,0.7013,0.4573,3.207,2.199,0.3364,0.017,0.037,5.4818,4.9422,6.5366,1.366,0.4117,3.1858,1.219,4.6162,1.4477,1.4391,0.8238,0.5997,3.1842,0.8189,2.6291,0.3261,2.6032,1.0595,2.5058,2.4703,2.6795,2.3792,5.7676,1.6761,3.0692,1.6813,1.118,2.3015,0.0699,4.489,0.5591,3.9698,0.088,1.656,4.621,4.988,2.8666,0.6112,5.1396,2.1964,0.4171,0.0566,0.0197,0.0029,5.8575,4.5876,4.8185,2.1481,0.9658,1.2078,2.7469,5.1354,4.5566,8.0613,5.1664,1.5963,4.0292,4.7098,0.5578,1.1769,2.7823,2.2207,2.239,3.4884,1.3736,1.498,1.3635,2.7559,1.4635,5.8383,0.2005,4.01,0.5436,0.0443,5.7247,1.9447,0.7136,3.4963,5.0932,3.0503,1.5854,2.1308,4.5233,0.3793,1.2095,0.7613,2.0779,2.4984,3.0836,0.4542]}

He denies it constantly.\n\nHe also denies that he ever was an alcoholic.\n\nIf I was in that position, I'd say that I have no idea where I would find all the evidence to prove he did.\n\nYou can only watch it once and only if you want to and I'd give the whole show away if the other segments have been cut off.\n\nI just want them to stop using \"man\" as a word.

Every time you perform a surgery, you have the ability to see memories of the patient you are operating on.\nI don't know what kind of brain surgery you're talking about, but \"surgery\" is pretty synonymous with \"physiologic activity.\" This means that you'll be performing surgical procedures that you \"see\" now (i.e. \"the doctor\" makes up memories we lost), without actually being able to talk to them, and without being able to make sense out of what they were up to because they are not in memory of you.\nYou know what happens when you lose your memory of the surgery you had?  Your brain is made up of memories of it.  You will have to change all your mind about it for some one who has never done it before to realize that the surgery you did a few years ago is actually the exact same as the one you were doing the 2 years ago.    At this point I think there may have been more than one specific moment I was able to talk to my doctor with something that would work for them or had some significance to have, but I don't have the time to figure it out :).\nOh God.

Then again, sometimes the pilot might have an issue deciding whether a plane should be flown in-ground, if the weather isn''t too good for it to be flown in-ground, or if the weather might be too bad to be flown in-ground. A lot of these are decisions that happen very often.\n\n'' Once the plane is off-target there is no way to make sure it will go straight again. `` There are more problems with ground jets than fly by ground, and there are less pilots in the US. With all those ground jets they are harder to navigate - there are more planes flying off-target with their sensors than airplanes are flying direct.\n\n'' Airplanes are not always ready to fly by ground because they can do so much damage to the engine and engine unit. Most of the planes I have seen destroyers that fly by the ground use a small camera, or a lot of time have to be spent to get the cameras where you expect them to fly.\n\n'' So it is safer where you want them, but that doesn''t mean that I '' can'' fly them all day. ''\n\n'' When you fly the pilots can see you flying in the right direction and when you '' want to '' fly '' it is almost impossible to make them do what they want to do.

There are many techniques you can use to avoid this situation - keep your eyes on the starboard side of the plane.","token_len":372,"entropy":[8.0946,0.811,4.897,5.3545,3.6173,4.3939,5.8112,2.3194,3.1849,2.3535,9.952,11.9792,6.6541,4.1786,5.4,6.0842,0.8878,2.5689,3.5469,4.6848,1.1297,1.1585,3.7082,0.8587,3.6022,2.0498,1.1908,4.2399,1.8591,0.0107,3.0769,5.677,1.4703,3.5476,4.4733,4.1385,4.0467,5.0094,5.842,0.007,6.072,6.0199,1.3015,4.6942,5.2017,0.6591,6.0716,2.0019,1.7877,3.1747,2.555,3.9112,3.2169,7.375,1.7167,3.6279,3.2689,1.5849,1.485,3.5206,2.6077,6.1496,5.1527,2.7932,4.4094,1.6234,4.517,5.1242,0.1712,0.0016,3.9731,2.9654,1.6651,1.2209,3.2627,1.5469,1.9714,0.7429,0.7455,0.475,1.6067,0.489,0.8558,1.1576,2.0122,4.9055,1.099,1.4004,0.5514,1.1214,2.5218,0.1996,0.2199,0.1896,0.0291,0.3119,4.8217,3.8302,0.2217,3.8665,2.6365,6.322,1.5114,4.2223,3.2892,2.9862,1.0483,1.5798,0.0003,1.1988,5.9182,1.134,2.1406,0.9778,3.9177,1.8149,5.2421,3.6254,0.4576,1.3975,2.0867,0.5958,3.6063,1.642,1.4871,2.7443,3.3478,2.9651,3.6269,0.5219,5.0974,3.9512,1.3343,5.1615,3.0575,0.9764,6.8012,8.3423,1.1345,6.7217,4.5452,3.9104,2.5053,1.5123,2.6742,0.6874,4.2031,3.226,2.3802,0.8728,6.1173,1.6394,5.9416,3.5311,3.3272,6.0781,1.5662,5.5267,1.4558,5.8947,0.1661,5.1093,5.6197,3.5479,0.8958,2.0373,4.129,1.8445,3.7052,0.965,1.0527,4.3489,3.2768,6.7322,2.4516,4.7272,4.6965,0.5274,8.4916,1.4034,2.1154,0.0002,0.1966,4.6461,1.3766,1.1181,2.6314,3.4315,5.3997,1.002,0.9306,4.2117,0.8546,4.324,1.0144,2.6916,5.0245,1.5569,0.7934,1.8364,1.3492,1.1147,5.0424,1.4547,3.856,6.4025,0.7725,5.085,1.7118,0.5029,5.0422,4.1175,1.0506,1.3333,7.1357,4.6995,3.3881,3.0344,0.9319,3.0456,3.0938,8.0402,2.5096,4.1644,6.8737,2.5434,3.1956,1.7098,5.8878,0.0631,5.9879,6.8994,1.8592,2.4901,6.1176,5.3136,1.4831,1.917,4.1762,6.0233,4.9922,5.5345,0.1603,0.1651,3.54,0.3932,2.1673,0.0002,0.0538,4.725,3.0728,0.8352,6.9299,7.721,1.7296,3.1743,1.8979,2.9122,1.3484,4.1439,2.3658,0.1436,0.0005,0.4275,1.6769,6.2108,6.9078,5.3678,0.8103,0.4649,2.7561,4.3742,2.2923,1.2257,4.5876,2.2737,0.0002,0.3134,4.3337,1.2724,1.9818,3.1241,4.7339,3.4751,3.5447,2.3519,3.0702,3.0054,1.0448,4.4985,0.6509,2.5467,3.6295,0.2618,6.6067,3.9333,0.8217,4.4675,1.2453,4.4044,2.6704,1.3352,4.2091,1.2777,0.6055,3.6658,3.3714,3.5155,3.5789,1.032,0.7251,1.6827,0.3589,0.3689,6.9978,1.7564,1.6917,1.4501,3.6024,3.566,0.9304,4.2787,2.4606,6.7971,3.1097,4.4742,4.5017,4.1295,2.6037,6.1077,3.0189,4.0203,3.8145,1.9717,4.5615,0.0404,2.1521,3.1077,5.9259,3.7353,1.628,2.7794,6.3561,0.6828,1.1372,2.2166,0.4832,4.2245,0.9089,2.5886,6.2293,3.6024,0.1288,0.4202,0.3318,2.7297,1.375,2.7722,3.4473,5.5822,1.3969,1.3384,1.4153,0.3431,8.885,0.2955,0.5701,0.7331,0.1615,1.8622,2.6635]}

A lot of these are decisions that happen very often.\n\n'' Once the plane is off-target there is no way to make sure it will go straight again. `` There are more problems with ground jets than fly by ground, and there are less pilots in the US. With all those ground jets they are harder to navigate - there are more planes flying off-target with their sensors than airplanes are flying direct.\n\n'' Airplanes are not always ready to fly by ground because they can do so much damage to the engine and engine unit. Most of the planes I have seen destroyers that fly by the ground use a small camera, or a lot of time have to be spent to get the cameras where you expect them to fly.\n\n'' So it is safer where you want them, but that doesn''t mean that I '' can'' fly them all day.

{"id":3386,"ended":true,"length":344,"text":"At the end of a massive bloodbath between warring nations, only a champion stands for each side. Describe what happens, ending the conflict once and for all.\n\nThe most interesting thing to me is that if he goes for a miracle and we all win, he will get 4 of the top 8 wins. There are so many other stories.\n\nI wonder if the winner of the match will be a male, female champion or a non champion. If the winner is a female champion, that would be the title match.\n\nThis is one thing that I find odd.\n\nIt makes it all seem like a random outcome.\n\nAs for the title match (i.e. the winner of the match will have it...) who knows?\n\nIt may be difficult but you can see that the winners of this clash won the title with the best shot at the title.\n\nThat said, I wonder how much the prize pool will be if the winner gets the title.\n\nI have been working on this problem all day but there is no answer.\n\nSo my theory is that, unless there is only one winner, all the contenders for the title would go for the title instead of the other.\n\nSo I got this idea.\n\nIf he wins the title in February or early March, that would give me 4.

To get both, he would have to beat the loser of last year, but also only beat the loser of this year.\n\nI have to imagine that both candidates would go to the ring after the next match or the winners would compete in the same ring.

When we get into a debate or a battle or something, we simply forget about it.\nAt the same time, when we are enjoying something, we forget about what happened, and we simply forget about it so that it happens.","token_len":375,"entropy":[5.2847,11.6502,4.9717,1.9095,5.5737,3.8668,0.8841,7.8597,7.7166,6.6424,0.4589,6.7443,0.3021,9.2165,0.5444,2.7241,1.0313,1.9794,4.8889,13.2593,0.0456,1.9547,6.1621,3.7038,10.494,1.3423,0.635,2.4693,3.4217,6.5152,3.1787,1.8455,1.0215,3.7513,8.2761,1.5146,3.7951,6.5961,3.6497,3.4423,2.2293,3.5553,5.0495,0.7594,2.5443,4.0875,1.1521,6.3574,8.5189,2.3893,8.0709,4.9485,1.5048,4.6676,0.5253,3.3159,4.839,2.0952,6.1359,3.8362,1.031,9.782,4.0755,1.3375,2.798,1.1113,1.2639,0.7591,0.1753,2.2217,3.6012,0.6167,3.2968,5.3173,1.2638,4.3415,3.7971,2.9049,0.3621,0.1119,1.5656,5.9271,3.9612,0.3757,3.3295,4.926,1.5561,2.1718,2.3844,2.3965,1.881,6.3936,1.0114,4.7444,0.7712,1.518,4.3719,3.1028,4.6737,5.1319,2.5362,1.8708,1.3827,4.5514,4.1324,0.7964,3.2032,0.8099,6.3514,1.3727,1.8992,5.1816,1.1803,2.9342,0.4078,6.2865,1.3989,6.8229,2.9347,0.9753,2.4608,2.8252,1.9338,2.2161,4.527,2.7599,8.0043,7.3564,1.1973,0.5173,3.992,1.1631,3.6017,2.1553,4.2242,3.8374,2.2789,4.6959,8.1885,0.7764,3.2908,4.3206,4.1548,5.8844,0.3794,0.2568,1.3943,5.9831,4.1217,4.3374,4.6806,0.2345,6.4104,4.6084,4.0238,3.2668,0.786,1.8897,0.5269,0.5766,5.2789,8.5531,0.3497,2.6117,2.4639,7.0659,8.4478,3.252,5.9532,2.6616,5.4247,1.7869,0.3134,4.6141,0.8467,6.8479,2.0918,1.378,0.3115,0.7036,5.0571,3.2018,2.2926,3.4614,3.9252,5.3177,1.7092,0.2301,1.0488,4.8753,1.7677,0.2438,0.1568,0.566,2.3502,2.3418,3.5917,3.4091,2.0936,5.1088,2.3355,3.243,0.7344,0.4019,0.6503,2.4973,5.2812,2.2723,2.0636,4.5832,3.2284,2.8957,1.8057,6.808,1.0937,0.6444,2.1095,0.5867,1.2595,3.5457,2.5247,1.6156,4.2507,2.4754,3.2317,0.4082,0.7669,2.1141,1.6337,0.7403,2.2725,0.6428,0.0269,0.0539,0.0491,0.264,0.6882,1.3326,0.4878,1.0247,1.0725,5.275,2.9624,0.0583,0.1973,0.2492,0.2746,2.5951,3.4352,3.7576,0.8665,2.7856,5.3068,3.741,1.3435,0.3166,1.2372,2.2557,6.4959,2.2767,4.5972,8.8633,1.9771,7.4788,0.6815,0.4523,3.343,0.379,3.3287,1.9686,4.166,0.0831,0.111,0.4524,1.9217,3.0679,1.0425,1.2746,5.4803,3.2284,4.2543,2.484,4.8195,0.3287,1.9859,0.2389,2.6686,2.1133,3.604,2.9602,2.3464,0.4009,0.6544,5.217,1.9969,1.8507,1.1338,4.3668,2.3467,0.8072,0.697,0.5867,0.7434,1.0301,1.2915,6.1182,4.8606,0.4954,2.0961,2.3579,3.1906,2.7064,2.1092,1.8209,2.4235,0.5859,1.1731,0.4455,2.2581,1.1282,2.5645,4.9251,5.0309,1.6741,0.0023,0.0035,1.4524,5.017,4.0699,4.5846,3.2519,1.1261,4.6724,3.1445,1.4836,4.6441,2.8755,3.013,0.5326,0.8416,6.0012,5.9827,1.7467,2.104,0.6363,1.2237,5.6492,1.2858,1.3182,0.0051,0.0382,2.0974,0.3572,2.0359,4.4105,2.6613,0.896,0.407,3.7468,0.6472,3.3201,4.9888,2.6607,1.5918,1.1079,4.0246,1.9921,0.5496,2.1713,7.5472,1.3277,2.2757,3.4106,1.722]}
{"id":1416,"ended":false,"length":336,"text":"A centuries-old vampire, turned as a child, takes advantage of being perpetually stuck as a little girl to prey upon those who would harm and abuse children.\n\nThe book The Witches of Eastwick by Peter McAllister tells the story of a young girl who has survived, while being a child, an evil vampire-like, and she is only allowed to be touched by people she knows. Although this book is mostly about the child who came into the world from a different realm, it also presents the real world and brings viewers a behind the scenes look into how the children of the evil vampire have been manipulated by the vampire and how they are treated by humans and the vampire herself.\n\nThe Witches of Eastwick will also touch upon the evil vampire world as well as all those who have become its victims. The author goes on to talk about how she came to be the author of Bloodborne, Bloodborne II and Bloodborne 3 and how much the book is meant to bring back in memory of both of those series.\n\nAlso available in print:\n\nDedication\n\nThe Witches of Eastwick is the first full-length series of books, all about children, in the United States and globally, by Peter McAllister. Written in one month, the first ten chapters will be released in print in February 2014. The main characters\u2014Clare and Peter\u2014are children of the vampires who have come to eat their children out of cold blood, while also protecting and caring for their parents. All the characters also have parents who love them very much and who love them deeply.\n\nThe book is both a children-centric and a children's book, as these children are the reason why the vampire is known and the reason why you will see this author at such high levels of screen time.\n\nAlso available in print:","token_len":375,"entropy":[11.0879,0.475,0.1867,9.9772,3.3432,7.93,5.5798,0.5764,2.2738,1.5194,6.7602,4.7401,0.0189,6.287,8.6805,5.019,5.3389,0.46,6.0781,0.6508,1.7102,5.957,1.5939,4.0392,1.027,2.8919,4.2268,4.4253,4.0239,6.8062,0.4864,2.0426,0.0075,2.5191,4.1108,6.0559,5.4585,0.6017,6.0865,2.4566,2.948,4.6793,5.3081,4.7523,0.0123,3.8852,0.3602,0.4789,0.0382,1.5285,1.8679,1.681,1.265,2.6883,5.8962,4.6879,4.6256,2.7147,4.3453,2.773,0.3551,2.6949,2.5675,0.7577,6.3387,1.6043,4.6498,3.0078,4.4359,1.7118,5.5304,3.2441,0.2348,3.182,6.948,0.569,5.2352,2.2476,1.691,0.7035,5.4348,3.0431,2.4957,0.9481,5.1811,1.0401,1.3076,4.5129,3.5369,5.4815,1.885,1.8735,0.2865,2.538,2.0538,3.1643,4.8507,0.5245,1.1807,1.4706,4.9076,1.5529,5.0085,1.5945,3.1398,6.1739,6.0669,2.2963,7.4622,1.1251,0.0616,0.6294,1.3587,2.8033,1.2539,4.2852,0.7311,1.6946,5.748,0.7275,3.9315,1.6043,3.4893,1.5089,1.1354,3.2608,3.3209,1.9645,1.2654,1.8846,4.0959,1.2079,5.1007,2.4708,1.9929,2.8089,6.1459,0.1421,0.5702,0.0003,1.4279,1.6625,0.0619,0.173,0.0005,4.8953,3.1763,7.104,1.4116,1.0156,6.1631,1.3276,5.0723,4.3764,1.0889,0.7383,5.0368,3.781,1.0171,1.4645,4.0079,5.0972,1.3374,0.9081,2.0189,4.3439,4.2973,0.552,0.0205,2.8723,0.0851,1.1244,3.276,3.4074,0.1785,1.3714,2.7884,3.0369,0.5729,8.3053,3.5031,0.8992,5.298,0.5703,2.0402,1.5441,1.0611,0.1134,2.9374,2.2444,1.2907,5.4457,3.1284,3.1688,2.7369,2.8836,0.0447,3.6106,3.42,4.4649,7.4742,0.5869,5.7331,1.0419,1.1322,3.2411,0.3646,0.4566,0.0001,5.0124,4.7966,2.0296,3.199,3.0947,0.8831,0.0002,5.6943,5.3232,1.6347,2.9672,0.0002,1.93,1.6403,0.0337,0.0928,0.0012,1.2994,2.8803,1.9196,4.5138,0.6514,0.3523,3.9777,1.9138,3.2157,3.8307,4.8143,3.5257,2.8894,2.2501,4.1961,1.045,4.3362,0.4124,1.8739,5.7542,2.3177,2.9989,1.098,0.0935,0.0061,0.0003,0.5905,5.5843,2.4651,6.2252,5.1382,0.9512,1.3241,3.0376,5.7346,1.8151,1.8604,0.5858,2.5067,0.9613,4.2165,1.6212,3.3439,2.5685,0.4615,1.8022,6.7502,2.6146,7.6255,5.6538,2.5739,3.9635,6.4503,0.6946,1.3142,4.8123,0.9397,1.0999,4.7537,1.6672,1.9411,2.9226,0.5445,7.266,2.3449,2.9127,6.1265,0.0851,5.6169,0.2078,1.7497,3.7891,2.8591,4.5656,2.7182,2.5786,0.0413,1.6485,3.1987,0.6808,4.9434,1.8843,1.9602,4.8597,1.7007,5.9673,0.9906,4.1092,0.5842,5.9108,0.0275,1.1184,2.1148,4.0604,1.3849,3.155,0.5552,0.9354,0.0002,1.4159,2.1753,1.3301,6.576,0.93,2.9779,4.5843,2.5171,1.3388,0.4541,2.7219,1.6455,1.3194,1.2928,2.572,4.8604,2.4867,1.016,3.1081,5.7613,1.1327,1.1464,2.9074,3.0268,4.7359,3.4954,2.8089,0.9665,0.5299,5.0652,2.4297,2.3002,3.6787,6.2651,4.9124,5.4026,4.3721,1.5622,0.678,7.6999,0.5511,0.4078,1.0251,0.0002,4.246,0.2435,0.1955,0.5352,0.0479]}

{"id":88,"ended":true,"length":362,"text":"It is modern times and the British Empire still rules over all of its colonies and the land they've expanded to ; however, rumours of rebellion and independence have recently begun to spread.\n\nThe British Empire is clearly a feudal society, with a much stronger sense of social, political and legal values, and its central role throughout the whole of human history is largely the same as that of the feudal kings of Rome (and more so of the empire's rulers).\n\nIt is the role royal family will play in modern day Britain, in the interests of protecting our interests and prosperity, while ensuring that we are not left feeling hopeless and unable to defend our rights as we move from one place to another. To this end, the Royal Family will often act in certain ways.\n\nThe most famous example is not only the royals of Wales but other UK colonies, as well. As we all know, a British colony is a \"town\" in which the colony itself is an equal part ( and that is in most areas) of a British province.\n\nBritain has been trying all of these \"towns\" for a very long time. As part of its efforts to conquer British colonies, some have set up colonies in their own territories. The colonies were called colony-states and were first created by the English, then by the English in 1748.\n\nIt has been almost 400 years since 1748 that the British have set up colonies in their own provinces. It has even been one of the most successful examples of a colonialist's policy. During many of the colonial wars between colonies, the English usually had to fight each other for territory (like they did in the 1800's or the 19th century). In the 1850s the British were known as colonists and in many cases their territory was their first possession, but most of this was later occupied by the British.","token_len":379,"entropy":[2.8999,11.0262,4.0024,2.557,1.8899,6.7532,2.2816,5.3398,5.4172,3.6916,4.2407,0.9585,2.944,2.7296,2.3913,2.7066,5.5112,4.1273,5.1157,6.9636,2.7002,12.0814,5.2088,0.2339,10.4866,1.2543,5.7739,2.5229,6.8613,1.6149,4.5387,2.9422,0.2715,0.8075,1.4534,1.428,0.0778,2.1556,2.2957,0.7833,1.5824,6.2883,2.3097,5.2623,2.6185,1.4513,2.1428,2.3163,6.8927,3.8988,4.1436,0.0125,3.5333,4.68,0.818,0.3158,3.9151,5.3381,2.8059,1.4452,3.6645,5.5077,2.0608,5.5583,0.8212,4.4562,0.5059,3.2453,0.032,1.9809,4.8792,4.1447,3.7464,0.9897,0.6046,0.2117,0.9941,2.5923,6.0868,1.9142,5.6329,4.1089,2.3497,5.0137,2.651,1.8056,0.8439,4.8567,1.768,4.6085,1.2442,1.5857,0.0003,3.2907,0.755,3.3556,5.7572,11.0516,2.6331,5.1419,0.2751,0.4959,4.5218,3.6418,1.0891,1.8129,3.5749,1.8588,4.6073,0.01,4.2243,5.0397,3.4142,0.9569,5.1513,0.8501,3.6282,3.5905,0.8221,2.3823,2.0073,2.5682,3.7035,5.6445,6.9111,1.7779,4.1034,0.0192,3.4431,1.42,1.9787,3.7043,4.0205,5.2452,3.0619,2.0181,3.4643,0.1609,0.0736,0.38,5.7348,2.2384,0.0486,0.2564,1.42,2.7178,0.1364,1.4076,5.6836,4.146,2.4356,6.1814,0.6411,3.0601,0.8097,0.0003,2.0998,2.8189,2.8306,0.6263,1.217,6.5377,1.766,0.9984,6.4932,0.0184,2.3648,4.9538,1.4296,4.1634,5.8283,3.0294,1.6457,2.3426,0.5314,0.7994,4.1375,2.9797,3.4923,0.069,0.2882,4.0669,3.4175,3.1406,1.1892,1.3839,5.0196,6.6918,1.162,1.8795,2.1581,1.7623,5.4102,3.6131,0.7087,4.1573,5.6625,0.9914,4.1956,7.9406,6.0025,1.3156,4.2927,3.716,5.2145,1.1912,0.2546,3.0323,2.5373,3.8618,0.5475,1.4944,0.0003,4.5714,1.8201,2.5705,5.5776,6.2441,3.1526,2.1064,4.8519,2.0017,0.2497,0.0908,1.4073,2.2329,1.9188,0.0346,0.027,1.3269,3.8563,4.1871,0.0028,2.0485,4.0352,0.5944,5.8687,6.1039,2.6561,0.9344,5.6218,3.7351,5.417,0.1619,2.4554,1.268,3.9949,0.9432,2.3143,1.2961,2.4552,3.6248,2.3394,4.8334,6.0333,3.3741,1.2004,2.5258,1.7452,6.0819,2.8476,1.4382,0.9928,2.759,3.1286,3.8682,1.5292,0.6734,3.3864,2.5112,1.742,4.0561,0.5314,0.8997,0.0002,3.9043,2.8358,0.6471,4.3168,5.0786,0.0141,0.0565,5.6802,0.4186,2.1444,1.0149,0.8352,4.4047,2.6326,0.0999,0.6188,0.5944,1.4084,0.1094,3.7882,1.0468,3.549,1.9948,4.3245,0.2887,5.8128,0.5031,0.2259,1.8423,1.364,5.7785,0.2596,2.7815,2.9945,4.9647,4.4791,4.8562,1.7848,4.7565,6.3947,1.0692,1.3831,1.7899,0.9322,4.067,5.7671,0.5812,1.0775,2.8157,6.8424,3.3938,1.6543,2.347,3.4309,0.0522,2.532,0.9535,3.4769,4.416,3.6324,0.4916,0.8624,0.8213,4.2479,1.963,3.6995,1.6205,3.6903,0.0295,0.1663,1.2379,2.9626,1.6892,4.7903,1.3147,2.647,0.9266,2.6619,5.5327,0.2406,6.1198,1.7977,2.863,3.8841,1.231,3.8501,3.2318,0.3933,5.5524,5.236,4.6073,2.3562,2.0394,4.8697,0.8075,3.4469,1.4642,4.4581,4.5346,0.1482,1.2154,1.7106,1.1647]}

A future that will be more than our ability to control.\n\nWe, the people of the world, are being made of dust.\n\n- Albert Einstein","token_len":380,"entropy":[10.1353,0.6578,0.9535,2.0573,9.9374,1.8189,0.304,0.8672,2.2665,3.0,12.0327,6.55,0.9787,3.7344,0.0349,2.61,11.6217,4.1072,0.9569,5.8538,0.1342,0.9433,4.8104,6.1911,2.1668,1.9683,0.0096,2.0995,5.105,1.4951,3.1513,3.8819,1.5249,1.055,1.5819,0.0002,6.1028,6.1762,1.081,7.4862,2.8679,0.0005,5.0457,5.2195,0.5413,1.8688,0.9627,0.7738,1.4778,0.1467,1.5579,4.1997,4.1985,4.4658,3.6241,0.7523,0.4427,0.0002,5.6399,6.9417,0.0884,0.7097,0.0003,5.6229,2.4672,1.8315,2.1331,5.4849,0.6927,5.0338,6.1935,2.4015,4.8095,0.0336,4.0609,7.0541,1.4103,4.3906,2.9065,5.2733,2.6361,1.6169,4.4742,1.7215,0.8898,4.9613,0.836,0.866,0.0002,1.431,4.5996,0.1613,3.823,0.019,0.0074,0.739,7.6028,2.8568,5.9836,0.2138,0.5565,1.0765,0.0092,0.0752,2.9218,1.9459,2.9259,0.7164,3.1117,6.4562,2.2074,1.0385,1.0784,0.3388,0.0002,5.9087,5.0638,4.0596,0.7262,3.6349,2.1947,0.4879,5.6476,2.5881,0.9109,7.2193,1.3153,1.0372,3.9376,2.1512,0.0026,0.2495,0.0019,0.0072,0.5363,2.6579,5.2078,1.4268,0.1467,4.6339,2.4383,3.1784,0.4765,0.1799,0.0066,1.1725,7.9608,5.7767,1.0318,2.8911,5.9913,4.2886,1.6252,4.0974,1.511,11.4875,6.8955,3.9402,6.1526,5.7364,5.5705,2.1112,5.0331,2.6967,6.7067,2.5158,2.566,3.1633,4.3328,1.9746,4.9919,1.0175,0.2809,4.4803,1.3566,2.3817,4.254,0.328,5.3942,3.6603,0.4283,0.9393,6.5437,2.9032,0.8195,3.0867,0.0016,1.6528,6.4993,5.1403,3.5458,5.0677,1.7982,2.0654,1.441,0.1689,1.9034,4.4427,1.4119,4.7035,2.9208,3.0075,3.7094,2.2299,0.3175,3.3204,0.6517,3.8685,1.7717,0.4338,1.4222,3.9698,4.2182,1.4957,5.3784,7.0096,0.6186,0.0002,2.742,3.9478,0.3586,1.2248,1.5761,2.1752,1.9624,0.5913,0.2526,0.2212,6.2981,0.2623,0.303,0.0724,0.0148,0.0285,0.0052,0.0016,0.0305,0.1995,0.027,0.0054,0.0158,0.0013,0.0224,0.0315,0.0006,7.6356,11.4056,0.0013,1.1363,0.0009,5.4897,3.1339,0.0011,0.0001,0.0012,0.2372,4.8812,0.0002,4.8856,3.9867,4.703,3.1911,1.2862,4.9951,1.8402,2.725,5.428,0.0718,4.0708,2.8942,0.4671,1.7395,2.4476,6.0816,1.7638,0.5382,0.4393,0.8912,2.3614,3.6327,1.4788,1.867,0.1978,4.8479,3.6932,3.6336,0.6786,3.471,4.5346,5.0105,4.3361,0.1179,6.4229,2.4145,5.4558,12.205,2.6953,6.8838,1.3705,3.9741,5.2561,11.1896,4.3911,6.7532,1.9799,3.531,5.667,0.5906,2.2713,0.2424,4.3182,2.9231,1.5181,4.2351,1.006,4.5574,7.0758,2.5441,3.9548,4.5808,2.1263,0.427,1.813,0.1858,4.6427,1.9165,0.1507,2.5242,3.0387,2.7021,0.0857,4.6307,2.6073,0.9195,2.1147,1.0638,0.7648,0.0541,6.0689,3.7349,1.2918,0.3648,2.6479,2.034,3.6304,1.1992,5.7077,3.9539,1.2236,2.6139,1.9163,2.773,2.7745,1.6387,1.3041,0.0031,0.0218,2.6226,1.3715,0.0002,2.0029,3.4618,0.2148,0.1311,0.1487,0.0265,0.0453,0.1018,0.2666,0.1334,0.0038,0.0071,0.028,0.1383,0.4875,0.0002,0.8803,1.9403,0.0009]}

What if you had an experience like this? If the invaders have had the opposite experience and were determined to try and get to their goal, it would be very weird.\n\nThe invaders are a far more powerful force here. The invasion of Iraq is now the final frontier, and is in many ways the final frontier for that nation. It takes years of study, planning and planning all to finally reach its goal.\n\nThe invading invaders should have tried something different. If they had a solution for killing their subjects, then they would have found one. Otherwise it\u2019s still quite a few years out; however, this is exactly the situation that was created in Syria in 2007.\n\nIt is not clear why invading is so important in today\u2019s battlefield.

The main reason for the lack of protection is that most people don't realize they can't leave a room full of them while they're at it.\nIn-home, the same is true of \"fancy\" people being able to do this. We had someone come into our house and tell us we could \"sick\" out of the house without having to leave our house.\nI can't tell by the video that you're just being facetious...\nIt isn't.  Your perspective is way more important than your actual sense of what is and isn't safe in a bedroom.\nYeah, I just realized it really bugs me that people can think of something good to do while we are here. I can't make it out to a friends house but I don't think the person is thinking that we can do that, and I think they would have been more worried about being found out if they had to leave us there with something to drink or poop, or had to have their shoes taken back and cleaned out in the shower and wash their hands, etc\nOh God.   I totally relate. Living up to that level of \"bait\" is such a relief.

They are the ones that need to be looked after by the authorities.\nFor me, the most important factor is who they care about, and most importantly, how many steps they can take.","token_len":383,"entropy":[7.9609,6.1528,0.7047,0.7097,4.4334,1.1115,7.1099,0.3993,4.2449,2.8907,7.3365,0.0576,2.4789,2.9978,3.7142,1.436,0.5985,2.8778,0.8303,1.1785,3.4764,4.5722,0.0014,10.3892,1.7004,8.4618,8.2176,2.1561,11.0155,3.1137,0.0629,0.2988,0.9516,3.3978,9.4018,3.6919,1.9548,0.1929,0.8235,6.8713,10.3888,5.2887,1.6496,1.6443,3.2391,1.8362,0.0102,7.5991,0.6925,0.8506,3.7197,3.2067,1.7713,0.0008,2.6749,2.0142,2.6405,0.8488,5.3249,2.1677,3.2084,3.5469,0.0113,3.805,5.0575,1.0718,0.4694,3.7011,0.733,0.5567,2.6262,6.6556,6.7951,6.9104,4.0723,2.6085,5.1771,3.2225,0.0503,1.4592,6.0107,5.275,4.515,1.7652,4.7201,6.7188,2.3045,0.0031,4.8119,3.512,1.4312,5.1573,5.1976,4.6112,4.0433,2.3017,0.4895,0.9192,1.3026,2.3283,0.1532,2.2435,2.6011,4.3113,5.7588,3.7975,1.1113,6.023,0.3347,2.387,1.1346,3.1136,1.7165,0.1332,2.953,2.544,2.666,0.8784,4.5749,2.9837,3.4961,0.9046,2.5698,9.6491,2.2075,5.6984,2.0695,4.2051,1.8735,4.7835,2.9025,7.174,0.0353,6.4296,2.0332,3.594,5.1168,0.0009,3.8073,2.1505,6.0229,6.1977,0.8551,7.4032,1.8577,0.7535,0.3424,0.9485,3.3499,5.6221,0.057,3.0847,2.2075,2.7714,0.2816,0.0001,4.4448,2.7794,2.7843,4.4739,0.5185,1.6223,7.1444,0.2743,1.6371,4.9597,3.7489,2.908,6.1306,5.9626,0.0281,1.4619,2.0666,2.2762,5.2059,2.4806,4.1166,6.7564,3.6017,0.8747,2.0611,4.6876,2.5268,3.9315,0.9327,2.749,2.999,0.5576,4.9985,1.9962,3.409,1.9169,2.5834,8.1712,0.9718,5.6678,0.6681,4.4764,0.0008,1.7011,3.7336,3.7596,2.6943,4.2054,3.2895,3.6367,2.7659,2.13,2.4616,3.2618,2.6297,1.0474,2.1167,1.4332,4.3281,2.6755,2.2532,2.3588,4.8036,0.4286,3.284,4.628,0.5203,2.1079,0.6351,2.0816,3.5887,1.9602,3.079,3.837,4.6011,3.8744,1.5804,3.3177,1.7038,6.4408,3.5687,0.9122,5.4573,0.5323,3.7334,2.4038,5.6096,3.1353,6.8796,3.0406,4.6107,2.7822,3.756,1.0037,2.8652,3.2524,5.7469,1.566,0.5985,2.5266,2.6339,6.2589,4.8424,5.3132,1.7034,1.2389,4.0479,2.2944,5.6489,8.3025,1.6297,9.6523,5.6429,0.5463,2.792,3.9741,0.3797,3.5536,5.5736,3.6883,1.2178,1.1967,4.925,0.2373,3.7663,0.7394,0.7274,1.8439,3.4135,0.4076,1.553,3.912,2.5822,3.6314,0.7757,2.2835,1.8018,6.0559,5.366,1.7056,6.8691,0.1759,3.653,2.9567,4.8338,6.6082,3.5765,1.1089,2.0718,0.8306,3.9935,2.7007,2.7081,3.9211,5.0703,6.745,4.1159,2.9144,1.7532,0.0022,4.4177,6.1414,0.7197,0.731,2.7791,2.4213,0.001,6.0605,0.0528,0.77,2.135,1.0746,2.1877,2.7499,0.1413,3.5533,1.9299,4.4965,1.8393,3.6356,3.066,5.97,1.1809,1.0042,0.0263,5.066,1.4425,4.205,1.5947,4.0236,1.5093,1.6831,2.8344,0.7138,1.1445,5.2172,0.4711,3.2328,1.9177,4.467,0.8778,1.8712,5.2302,2.3576,0.3762,2.1323,2.334,1.1848,5.0951,1.0405,5.5049,2.1406,5.3609,0.135,2.0249,1.1936,6.4406,0.6395,0.685,1.878,4.1925,6.0516,0.3824,2.633,0.1508,2.5177]}

How does the wp community respond in a RL approach?\nProbably not, if they want their articles to appear in a subreddit they aren't allowed, and if they're willing to pay for a small amount of their work, it's just a formality since \"filling out a form\" is an extremely simple, easy way to be paid for.  And why are stories houses supposed to be paid for in the first place?\nThis is one thing, but to give us an idea of how things work I'm curious as how you're getting your news from the Reddit community when i've only read that one comment here and there and never seen one before. But to give us an idea of what some of the people think of stories houses I wouldn't really need to know a lot about the world.\nI'd be happy to read it for you mate, and that would be very helpful, though I've only read what you've written in the past couple of days and I've been really intrigued in your comments so far, so I'll have to have an ear and see what I can come up with if the subreddit goes down without a hitch :o\nI just want to say, that's actually what I'm afraid of...

{"id":382,"ended":false,"length":363,"text":"For the past century, portals to a demon dimension have been opening up over the surface of the world. The largest portal has just opened in the middle of NYC, destroying the city. Now only a small child stands where the city was.\n\nThe portals are small enough that it doesn\u2019t require a lot of physical force to create them. It will take much less energy to create them in-game than the portals in their actual locations. But there are also some limitations.\n\nOne of the limitations is not allowing the portals to fire their weapons much longer. This means that the portals don\u2019t have the ability to fire their weapon and use it in an attack. That means that the only way to move the portal through the area if it\u2019s already down is by stepping back in time and running a little longer as though to fire your weapon.\n\nThe best part has been the fact that whenever you\u2019ve run through a portal in a world that doesn\u2019t use electricity and you\u2019ve run into that portal in the past, both portals will drop you out onto the ground in a heartbeat. When you try to walk up the stairs in a world where there are no power grids, you have to climb and push through the gaps where you\u2019re meant to have been.\n\nSo far though, the portal is a far cry from what we saw in the early Days of Destiny 2. In fact, we can\u2019t find the ability to drop any items into the portal and therefore do other activities after they open up. There are no quests in the portal. You only get to choose one which can be done at any time and therefore the portals appear only a few seconds before the actual opening.\n\nBut again, it works the way it does and the portals seem to be able to do plenty of stuff for you too!","token_len":383,"entropy":[2.5562,2.9839,5.5357,0.3315,13.3871,0.9554,3.6399,9.9932,5.5787,0.6116,0.7106,4.679,1.1199,5.7,0.5836,5.413,0.2796,0.8419,2.4258,0.7949,2.2733,6.4335,2.1186,2.5765,5.4342,1.327,1.7576,0.9405,4.7689,0.0112,9.702,1.2207,7.9781,1.3173,2.5778,1.7053,4.0808,5.8025,1.6112,1.7883,7.8797,5.1994,5.4999,1.2277,5.9402,2.2207,2.9204,2.2584,0.0275,2.0122,3.9391,1.268,5.2865,2.1787,1.2447,2.3973,3.4415,17.0743,6.4992,1.1579,5.1035,1.6151,2.7001,0.0469,5.8272,1.8562,0.434,3.8044,1.776,0.5554,2.867,4.0272,1.7534,5.3419,0.9776,1.748,0.745,1.0465,1.8325,3.8785,5.9879,0.4632,1.775,3.0207,3.2046,2.6602,6.5044,3.6251,3.6907,0.3734,4.5154,3.2277,0.7421,4.0122,2.7618,4.7294,0.9416,1.2065,0.0002,4.0024,0.7157,0.3318,3.5068,0.3413,5.6986,3.5294,1.8922,2.5146,0.1681,5.9274,3.6984,3.6759,6.9786,3.8386,1.4544,2.5873,1.7733,0.5516,1.7396,2.3312,4.183,0.4291,0.5846,0.0464,1.789,1.7671,2.4035,0.0184,1.6175,1.8785,2.9441,5.1467,4.4721,1.7441,2.5758,3.4406,2.9746,0.6817,3.7578,1.0153,0.6109,1.6457,3.8554,0.6136,0.7387,5.7924,1.7425,1.7498,3.9462,1.1704,4.8905,6.3444,1.7733,5.148,0.055,0.3122,4.907,6.9719,0.6751,1.2869,5.0948,3.9524,3.0387,1.3501,2.5542,4.8135,4.0558,3.2773,5.0558,5.529,5.7161,3.6428,4.3187,3.958,0.3367,0.7873,0.812,0.0002,1.6087,5.3382,3.5652,6.8018,0.2662,1.0248,2.1519,0.018,6.5669,1.3365,6.5713,0.4145,0.5846,3.8578,2.6905,1.4745,0.048,3.0296,1.9696,6.0716,1.6679,2.3369,0.0847,0.1914,0.0782,3.8057,6.5586,3.5298,2.9267,1.2418,0.0432,0.1543,3.1634,1.1278,4.7857,0.8906,3.0385,1.4565,2.6089,0.4069,7.2215,3.6986,0.6856,5.7163,2.9516,3.6293,6.8333,0.3352,1.448,3.2354,1.0478,6.0713,0.2849,4.6298,0.7394,4.6669,0.2544,3.456,3.0928,2.107,1.8436,2.7069,1.6116,1.011,2.3394,2.3745,1.5712,0.89,3.7283,3.4745,0.7637,1.2823,4.1621,0.7156,5.9081,4.5569,4.556,2.4356,1.1732,6.7467,4.7016,1.7447,2.2247,0.1068,5.2813,4.4339,0.0117,4.4224,1.4748,0.9605,0.9797,0.0003,3.4355,3.066,5.3859,0.1928,1.51,2.3045,2.8112,3.0383,5.7565,0.3372,0.0437,2.1609,2.1625,2.5133,0.5304,1.2137,5.4155,5.1092,0.1617,4.1931,4.7086,0.6752,3.6621,0.9498,0.1393,3.3065,3.7223,3.6063,0.1962,0.0672,3.9184,3.167,6.7456,0.2273,5.2908,4.4834,3.7096,3.0604,0.9086,0.4589,2.7945,6.9252,4.3211,7.1902,5.3194,6.3791,3.839,4.8783,1.652,0.4613,3.7554,0.9078,2.7827,5.6586,2.232,0.7021,4.0993,2.4968,3.4124,3.4728,2.0049,1.3336,3.9089,1.5957,6.4843,3.2863,0.4214,1.2099,3.2513,0.6624,0.9426,2.7871,6.5668,3.0062,3.5807,6.0806,4.5874,3.9317,0.9213,1.6461,1.9837,1.9734,4.728,2.3271,1.1248,0.5413,0.0002,3.7237,6.3216,0.1841,2.4559,5.8506,5.0723,2.1276,0.7495,0.794,4.098,2.6916,3.124,3.6395,0.2622,1.5116,3.6732,0.0031,2.5634,6.9179,0.1905,3.5411,3.4075,0.7557,5.6816,4.0019]}

He didn't tell his dad until years before the incident happened. It's possible he made a conscious decision not to tell his mom.\nThey both know he did. He did keep telling Superman he did it because he was the greatest assassin ever. If he knew he was telling it, he wouldn't have told Superman.\nHe didn't tell DC, but because they know he was. And because Batman wanted him to play as a superhero. And because DC had said Superman had never been part of that organization.\nThe fact that Batman didn't tell Superman to do anything to stop him really bugs me. The people who were actually good to Batman were super-stealing a superhero from DC.\nIt's more than that I believe.  If Batman is actually that powerful and has been stealing from a secret organization for 50+ years. That's all I've ever known about that.\nI think it's because DC knows it had to happen before they could give him to Batman. So they wanted him to help them, as long as they could find one where Batman couldn't kill anyone\nI don't think it's more than that.  That's why Batman is so important to DC, and the superpowers they bring to the table.  It's because DC believes they're the better version of Batman, but also that they're smarter than Batman.  Because they're the ones who are both better-known and who are the most important.\nHow are they smarter than Batman?

We could raise the bar more than ever.\n\nBut first, we need to make sure we don\u2019t forget that we are all in this together.","token_len":385,"entropy":[6.8972,2.5904,3.8061,4.1532,1.5332,10.3381,0.0526,2.5145,0.1525,8.3432,0.2422,2.4995,0.736,6.2303,5.7097,0.0574,0.5739,9.2614,0.3518,7.9348,6.7225,0.8998,1.9808,2.2341,2.2954,3.5235,7.5156,4.8,0.1857,0.4058,0.988,0.0005,2.7061,5.1983,0.3539,0.3613,0.3051,0.193,0.2214,0.0005,0.0005,0.0071,0.0049,0.0013,0.0115,0.0253,0.3564,0.0027,0.0007,0.0005,0.0097,0.0004,0.0015,0.0082,0.0005,0.0007,0.0007,0.0008,0.0161,0.0003,0.009,0.0011,0.002,1.8844,0.0001,5.1671,4.535,3.2922,3.4413,1.9335,4.56,2.2849,1.4768,0.1442,5.4369,0.5748,0.9583,1.3523,3.7503,4.4904,3.8911,5.3304,2.8786,1.824,2.2885,5.866,0.5471,3.3656,7.7135,2.0661,2.7,0.0368,3.9198,3.3844,2.0623,0.0014,4.7057,5.8034,1.509,3.0412,5.7569,3.1493,0.1756,2.1511,1.2927,0.014,0.0381,0.2812,2.8716,2.0238,0.7963,0.6724,0.0267,5.9537,3.3636,2.9617,4.3282,1.1674,1.6872,2.1052,1.3352,0.3282,0.5496,0.3435,0.0114,4.3811,2.7529,0.3696,1.14,4.0447,4.093,1.0868,3.5026,1.0295,0.5924,0.0001,3.4018,5.1378,0.2579,2.5436,1.871,5.6237,0.0224,4.1919,0.0907,2.1202,2.7339,4.6666,0.9438,2.0344,4.9343,0.0108,1.0289,2.1976,2.693,2.8061,1.6634,5.2177,3.6849,5.1422,2.3869,0.4482,3.7887,0.2889,0.3799,1.1413,2.3053,1.4816,2.7807,5.4951,4.2753,0.6513,2.2455,3.5355,2.598,0.7534,4.018,1.6859,3.6291,5.6252,1.1386,3.7641,0.9107,0.0001,4.3296,18.4311,7.8789,4.4817,2.3617,0.5638,1.9912,2.5613,5.9597,3.9392,5.1521,4.3626,2.1442,4.9334,3.7357,2.6906,4.5356,0.1518,0.0026,0.1148,1.0834,0.0001,5.4305,2.5213,3.4845,1.415,0.3617,0.1119,0.6717,4.7768,2.7721,4.0074,1.4474,3.1821,0.0304,1.4681,2.8147,0.3634,0.747,0.731,1.9604,3.9692,0.5646,3.6996,3.3645,2.7052,0.8174,5.0424,4.0673,0.4142,2.6449,2.0327,3.5879,0.6398,0.7729,1.1797,0.3893,0.8055,0.0001,2.6952,4.9386,4.6776,0.8245,0.1966,5.868,0.0001,2.9316,0.8943,0.3931,3.6719,1.5013,12.0307,0.9276,4.5536,3.3357,0.5967,2.6755,2.2856,1.012,0.5284,4.1163,1.8383,5.2822,4.8229,4.2014,5.023,4.8163,3.9267,0.3043,5.3091,1.2713,2.5512,0.9502,0.8106,7.2163,4.3859,1.5319,0.1359,0.3098,1.8192,0.4633,3.2269,0.6437,6.0352,2.6589,0.1318,0.0155,0.0251,0.1413,2.3387,5.4415,2.6423,1.0895,0.0186,0.0038,0.0107,0.0281,0.612,2.7728,1.575,2.4849,2.7925,5.74,1.9761,2.8963,4.1869,0.5538,0.4274,0.0001,3.2549,1.7275,0.849,0.1044,0.006,2.4124,0.2436,5.7527,0.4944,0.8077,0.1135,0.0097,0.7066,2.259,2.1192,4.6098,4.988,2.663,3.4098,2.0246,0.4073,4.8105,1.2711,4.0482,4.9017,0.2554,1.4996,6.6918,5.7551,1.9578,1.2202,7.2156,1.4942,1.3138,1.5583,2.6292,0.0128,0.7952,1.1675,0.1809,5.4835,1.0914,1.6179,5.5872,3.1228,0.5166,1.4615,0.9274,0.0001,2.7158,5.0884,0.3232,0.8901,1.1498,0.1584,2.9942,1.2457,0.8226,2.9471,0.4958,0.913,0.1838,1.9595,2.2008,1.4792,1.2338,2.6702,2.8082,0.5565,0.0129,0.3551]}

The crew was expected to spend five weeks per hole at Jupiter\u2019s sun to sample the moon\u2019s surface and make measurements.\n\nCape Canaveral is in the Gulf of Mexico, and is known in most areas as the launch site for the large telescope.\n\nNASA Director Robert Hurley said the mission should have a long life.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it will run all the way to the moon, and it\u2019s being called \u2018The Next Next.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth the name,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nVoyager 1 is expected to take off in September 2017 on a mission that will visit seven of Jupiter\u2019s moon surfaces, including the north of the moon, and return it to Earth for observation.\n\nNASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope, which was found by NASA near Earth in 2017, has been traveling the moon since 2004 and has seen the most complex structure of the moon.\n\nThe first Hubble Space Telescope was launched in January 2010.","token_len":386,"entropy":[8.6144,0.8086,5.0946,6.6297,10.5216,5.6171,0.6456,5.2497,1.5086,2.6462,2.4451,3.7551,4.1789,5.8871,1.2362,1.5652,6.2583,1.9034,7.3367,3.1816,1.908,2.8508,5.3138,3.3563,5.2647,0.2117,6.815,0.8527,0.4317,0.4437,6.391,1.9438,9.0618,3.4404,1.2768,3.2922,3.2698,5.5565,5.962,5.8529,0.0723,1.0144,4.6281,4.794,0.4707,0.2505,0.8238,0.0027,1.8197,6.7846,0.5541,1.2263,2.1511,6.231,5.4238,1.9401,5.1825,2.8803,2.3974,2.2529,0.0039,1.5691,0.2222,1.2364,1.1328,4.647,1.9358,1.6736,3.4313,3.0376,2.8697,6.168,1.1149,1.2845,7.6037,3.4617,2.2836,1.4226,6.3139,4.378,4.0478,3.0893,0.8352,3.5565,5.1338,2.9343,2.5943,2.6061,0.2996,1.795,5.1734,0.2312,0.977,0.0003,1.557,1.9704,0.4823,0.3726,1.6021,4.5906,8.0048,0.7514,1.6607,4.1011,0.504,0.7254,3.1841,4.0654,3.4221,3.5016,4.2639,5.5901,2.5512,3.359,2.5894,0.0631,15.0447,8.047,3.941,2.5417,3.5839,4.6046,1.9691,0.5371,3.5968,3.0556,5.1098,5.5408,5.989,0.4085,0.9062,1.7146,4.2269,5.0044,0.0018,1.1311,0.4108,0.0061,5.1461,6.1083,7.4709,1.8998,5.7275,1.7795,1.9535,5.4447,5.1123,5.1726,2.4394,3.459,0.0873,3.4676,6.8555,3.4913,1.3135,4.5786,6.7985,1.2468,0.0002,4.2697,1.998,2.6256,5.5726,7.4993,4.0917,1.3091,1.4763,4.2844,2.3421,4.387,0.0237,2.226,3.9374,2.1925,7.9831,11.4078,3.6682,3.204,13.1424,5.9425,6.166,7.5,4.9231,5.6903,1.7042,3.0407,3.7964,0.4428,0.482,2.4404,1.518,3.4754,1.9943,1.5771,1.1688,0.0004,6.1461,2.6785,0.011,1.7463,3.9738,0.7927,4.319,0.0924,0.035,1.0647,2.1581,2.2595,3.3173,5.224,5.8518,3.1167,1.0619,1.021,6.5823,0.3064,0.3843,0.9225,6.6711,6.0038,0.8019,1.2915,0.0003,2.7956,6.2305,3.9279,11.3399,0.601,1.0367,1.7323,1.5476,4.6762,2.8443,2.1562,3.9307,3.1899,1.0655,0.6868,0.0002,2.466,2.7265,4.0384,3.0619,0.0929,2.3082,2.2908,5.7774,5.6683,0.9886,0.1996,0.9362,1.5068,0.7196,2.2473,1.8372,2.5593,12.4985,0.572,0.0396,5.2698,5.0651,7.8511,6.0739,3.6298,5.408,7.5072,3.6197,0.8041,3.7202,5.0076,3.0561,1.3622,3.217,0.0747,1.0607,1.2934,1.5599,2.2621,0.0958,0.0524,3.9409,2.3073,5.3967,1.4277,2.9059,3.7772,5.9095,3.0635,1.0071,0.8551,0.4648,0.0003,6.2314,0.0027,0.0053,0.121,1.6193,2.529,0.0142,2.5613,2.4074,1.9532,3.5223,2.9123,4.7052,0.6049,1.2265,1.613,0.7534,5.0232,5.8796,1.9917,1.1028,4.2806,0.0861,0.0169,3.0408,7.9657,1.6223,1.1471,1.8916,6.0257,6.3303,0.7956,1.3701,1.5538,1.5601,3.9746,4.15,0.2325,0.1998,3.524,5.0914,0.453,0.4761,0.0003,2.7785,8.4898,0.9735,0.6003,5.0791,0.1221,0.0023,2.4866,0.9727,2.9288,6.3582,3.1951,2.2739,7.3577,3.9097,3.0124,7.0155,0.166,2.2821,1.5274,6.0675,3.0404,2.3406,1.4927,3.3783,2.516,1.6094,3.2003,2.0151,5.0663,4.6225,5.7238,1.3232,1.3143,1.429,1.3382,0.5791,0.0003,1.6568,3.8281,6.1974,1.1703,0.0029,2.0341,1.0294,0.4441,4.5624,3.2128,1.3621]}

But I suspect the Cubs, if they somehow can win the title this year, will be the one to make a run and hopefully win one of the first four Goldschmidt titles in the game.\n\n\"It was the greatest series of all time- both in terms of game and the history between the two teams.\" - Eddie Munson\n\nThe Cubs didn't have any major players with their #1 jerseys, either, but most of their players wore #1 jerseys anyway.","token_len":387,"entropy":[11.3842,2.2866,5.1887,0.3033,4.0008,0.9882,0.7382,0.0005,1.0523,8.5139,0.5211,3.2307,4.2987,5.4672,1.3011,2.0113,7.9582,2.0596,1.6003,3.1906,7.5489,2.2367,1.5633,3.849,1.0062,8.0361,15.8689,1.1211,6.3139,3.5721,7.5437,4.5109,0.3399,1.3652,3.2429,5.5374,1.0868,2.7598,1.1223,5.3705,1.7936,0.7883,3.9196,1.4618,0.0037,1.9719,1.8997,1.5451,0.7961,0.0014,0.0623,0.0053,0.0019,0.0018,0.032,7.5363,0.0008,0.0023,0.0032,0.0032,0.0013,0.0017,0.0008,0.0005,0.0003,0.0025,0.0016,0.0001,0.0006,4.2706,0.0043,0.0566,0.1088,0.011,0.019,0.0486,0.0707,0.002,0.0045,0.0083,0.0019,0.0004,0.0046,0.0459,0.0242,0.0017,0.0015,0.0129,0.0561,2.9542,0.0002,5.7873,5.0833,3.0394,3.05,1.4472,1.0125,2.6678,5.1955,5.8021,1.7829,2.9566,1.5011,2.1501,4.1628,4.897,2.1468,1.6479,4.0832,3.9836,0.389,6.3876,3.9278,2.3215,1.3332,4.393,3.5614,0.5805,0.1305,0.4279,1.6499,1.9608,3.5149,0.6531,3.2372,2.4707,3.8296,4.7688,5.5599,1.2523,1.4969,4.4224,0.6634,0.4489,3.9185,2.3034,5.7817,11.6815,0.0368,3.9314,1.8011,1.8732,4.4212,0.9891,0.8377,0.0003,2.6109,3.9442,1.5483,0.0916,0.8208,5.8317,3.6864,4.505,0.914,3.8348,3.6479,1.1269,0.0167,0.374,1.0057,0.6199,7.0722,1.6074,0.1804,5.4475,4.2336,0.1379,5.296,4.8093,5.5201,2.0812,4.9291,2.8839,6.2471,2.2106,2.6617,6.1427,5.6617,3.5467,1.4835,6.9119,0.997,0.7346,5.3599,3.7157,1.2532,0.1487,0.1594,3.5663,5.2734,0.2172,7.9369,0.8851,4.2318,2.6955,3.2278,2.1228,2.7206,1.6185,2.659,2.453,0.0009,0.576,1.7318,0.5695,2.2,4.595,3.0574,6.4382,3.6158,2.1935,4.9308,0.4642,5.0134,2.2862,4.6467,0.149,3.3405,1.526,0.7612,7.5685,2.1858,0.1053,0.1176,3.1451,6.4932,2.4002,2.4044,3.7023,2.377,2.283,3.7783,0.3135,1.2049,1.9156,1.9398,1.6944,1.7334,1.5923,3.3208,0.1142,0.1954,0.5517,0.7185,1.9799,4.5074,5.7606,4.9426,1.9875,0.8525,5.1224,2.5143,2.3734,1.6629,1.2013,0.139,6.3339,0.0305,1.1857,2.8791,1.7786,7.6208,2.9647,4.3585,0.1663,2.5287,3.2235,2.1078,1.6113,1.1993,0.0389,4.6206,3.2196,7.8001,0.0003,4.79,0.7725,0.0892,0.0168,0.0021,0.0023,0.002,0.0014,0.0138,0.0005,0.0011,0.0033,0.0073,0.0026,0.0136,0.002,0.0031,0.0061,0.0006,0.0005,0.0003,0.0073,0.0015,0.0026,0.0146,0.0011,0.0147,0.0016,0.0031,0.0013,0.0012,0.0031,0.0007,0.0033,0.0037,0.0006,0.0009,8.4903,0.1703,0.0052,0.0006,0.001,0.0042,0.0076,0.0049,0.0004,0.0003,0.0057,0.0036,0.0015,0.0023,0.0017,0.903,0.0002,5.2737,3.4696,2.8563,2.8741,3.1292,6.2174,1.2072,1.5774,0.0734,8.2671,6.1648,2.709,1.4658,0.0016,6.0793,1.3758,3.6073,5.7242,5.8375,0.7987,1.6025,0.5568,2.4283,1.0599,6.3558,7.4434,3.484,1.0312,0.0003,2.6089,1.4042,5.3857,0.0014,2.1563,2.7954,5.0045,4.4301,4.2482,2.8823,1.4449,0.0313,2.1743,1.8196,4.3632,1.8001,1.5451,5.5025,0.7334,2.5463,1.1528,1.3469,1.3684,0.439,1.8834,3.9737,0.44]}

{"id":543,"ended":true,"length":340,"text":"A new medical technology has been developed, allowing emergency responders to predict the location of the next accident before they even occur. Ambulances are now able to typically arrive at the scene very soon or even before the accident occurs. You hear an ambulance siren approaching you. You have noticed the ambulance siren sounds quickly. Once they arrive, they quickly tell you, the exact location of the next accident is unknown.\nIt may seem like a pretty cool idea, but it's far from any good news. If you're lucky, you may get a call from the ambulance siren for free, if you're lucky, you may get a call for less than $1,000 to replace the previous ambulance. And you can try it free at http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ambulance_siren. The video also has a lot of statistics to back up the claim. There are several reports of injuries in other emergencies and accidents at this scale.\nThe most common cause of injuries suffered by paramedics is a sudden, sudden or unexpected death or injury that results in serious personal injury. Ambulance sirens are a very helpful tool. The Sirens also include an SOS system that alerts you if something needs to be done, or if you have a possible emergency. The sirens also work well in helping you find other nearby emergency responders. Ambulance sirens are also a very useful resource for people who are in danger of getting trapped in an ambulance.\nIf you're lucky you might have the chance to save a life in emergencies.

You are a master assassin working for the government to help ease the burden on the economy.

Instead of spending money on programs related to hospitals, doctors, and medical research, let's focus on improving medical infrastructure. We must focus on supporting people's ability to access basic medical care through medical school, hospitals, and other medical facilities.\n\nThe problem with medical education is that all of them are useless. That means you cannot get basic things like medications, surgery, and medications from doctors. Your only instruction is to improve medical education and not allow a lot of unnecessary work to be done.\n\nThe government is making people think differently. That is why we have health care problems. We are constantly worried that they will not be able to get medical care due to the lack of medical medical facilities or because of drug shortages. We have all kinds of medical problems that must be addressed and we have no medical care in place.\n\nWe should get rid of these medical problems. We must invest in our health and education systems. To reduce the medical problem we should ensure that all medical students obtain the necessary medical education. We should train doctors more effectively. We should get rid of doctors who have too many courses, who go to doctor's courses all the time.

With all those technological advances, what do you do when there\u2019s a shortage of resources? What does a business need to do to have a more efficient use of energy or money?\n\nI understand our economy has been severely underfunded, our roads have been compromised. That\u2019s all there is to that. We need to develop a plan for what should happen when our energy use goes down and our resources are freed up and we\u2019re able to buy more power and power. Our economies are thriving, we\u2019re in a really good place.\n\nI would also suggest we spend more time making sure we invest in renewable energies, that we know there\u2019s going to be plenty of resources available when demand stops rising, but also that our needs are met.

It seems like the world population is growing faster than we\u2019re getting by too!","token_len":389,"entropy":[8.774,2.2567,4.5293,0.6773,3.1628,1.4117,1.8661,1.9312,3.4689,1.3011,5.2722,6.231,1.0246,10.8266,3.6975,2.3806,4.5433,5.674,3.4805,5.2526,5.1708,1.0114,2.4869,5.096,0.2636,0.7288,6.9042,6.487,2.4049,1.6785,5.2513,0.7971,0.1853,4.851,0.2096,2.2282,5.3523,0.1647,6.9241,1.2351,2.1354,2.0994,2.7787,2.2298,0.9672,3.0917,0.8225,1.8538,7.0874,2.9321,0.0167,0.3632,0.3373,1.2011,1.3711,0.004,2.4098,5.2525,1.463,1.8619,5.9727,5.3842,7.4296,3.7325,5.9236,2.6306,5.3191,1.116,2.2578,3.0062,1.4754,0.0003,4.8785,3.0277,2.4464,1.0204,7.0755,3.6007,5.8672,1.0679,2.4937,1.1406,2.0221,5.1678,3.1753,1.1485,1.0749,4.6605,3.0373,2.734,1.1735,3.5088,0.4584,0.3808,3.0598,3.2276,4.9647,4.7223,6.6801,3.9266,2.2391,3.0461,1.4911,0.5033,1.004,0.0002,2.6963,2.6714,2.348,2.7068,5.9547,0.5825,0.0295,0.8758,2.7185,2.3371,2.7616,0.2887,2.6805,0.9274,1.8938,0.96,0.3543,3.2722,3.1248,3.7679,2.9062,5.6664,1.3163,2.7278,6.8314,4.6333,16.4233,7.2684,3.0064,2.4139,1.0664,2.5827,4.0593,3.874,0.8929,1.6953,5.0135,1.1023,4.5507,2.8975,6.0674,0.1511,0.323,3.5113,1.6859,4.1751,3.4802,2.1145,3.2338,0.137,0.1719,7.0956,1.0086,13.1274,0.4457,2.436,4.6505,2.8541,0.2869,0.2902,0.4851,0.6426,0.0002,5.9383,4.3892,2.7838,2.5702,2.0951,6.4183,3.8349,3.0247,6.0685,3.955,4.2687,5.7777,1.1962,0.7514,4.9642,3.1056,1.416,2.218,1.9721,2.8783,4.4367,0.2765,3.1843,1.093,3.6662,0.6274,3.1369,0.6969,2.4853,2.9909,3.2,4.3107,0.9968,0.6877,0.3375,0.5204,3.8269,1.1284,4.8635,2.7892,5.4877,0.1101,3.1419,4.64,3.3242,0.2914,0.6884,0.0001,2.219,5.0062,5.2833,3.8761,2.0493,1.4589,6.0251,2.5176,0.8506,1.9508,4.8866,4.5405,1.9782,0.3156,5.3813,3.5197,4.6679,4.2489,0.0539,0.7651,4.447,3.4526,0.1662,0.2994,5.411,0.4878,2.2024,0.9063,0.2245,5.9452,2.1339,3.3559,1.8452,3.5705,5.1168,1.1951,2.8006,3.0249,1.7075,4.8073,2.9134,0.6253,2.7865,2.6229,2.8424,1.2684,7.0091,0.2185,3.1934,1.4619,4.881,0.0547,0.5049,1.2509,0.0089,5.9241,1.3052,3.9538,2.0847,4.9786,3.0574,5.2746,5.3199,0.9818,4.1007,1.4363,2.0325,3.8762,0.031,0.1649,3.8374,1.3019,5.6033,0.5132,1.2546,0.8048,0.7613,0.0001,2.0541,3.5085,2.8144,4.2476,3.3517,4.6905,0.9082,0.7422,4.9489,0.6013,1.7437,3.21,0.4758,3.337,3.0305,1.5963,3.9499,0.5383,5.4925,4.3178,1.917,0.0389,1.0255,3.3174,0.0019,0.0127,4.5652,0.0884,5.0806,1.0924,3.1993,5.0878,5.4298,2.6116,2.0367,4.0584,2.2491,2.0232,3.2606,6.8612,0.9568,1.7333,0.8599,6.1379,5.5342,5.4078,1.5382,6.8343,2.9269,1.2923,2.4807,1.3211,4.4276,3.799,1.8618,2.8068,4.4031,0.6363,2.0643,0.0094,1.5916,4.2883,0.0012,1.3276,4.8557,5.2625,1.518,1.0657,3.7286,0.2408,3.5914,3.2386,0.054,2.4501,4.0278,3.4387,3.4572,1.1684,2.4758,1.7455,8.0747,0.5429,1.3824,1.9531,0.1259,2.4605,6.0677,0.0574,0.7581,4.0552,3.2606,9.0765,3.5266]}

H. Houghton, the proprietor of Punchbook. The letter was received by Mrs. Houghton, who had not published any journal articles since 1848.\n\nMrs. Houghton wrote to her friend that her friend had sent her a letter which revealed to her that she was not only a person of some age but has become a respectable public figure. She then sent her the letter to discuss the future. Mrs. L. Houghton was very concerned that the letter had revealed her feelings towards the Punchbook, which would have been more than enough. The letter was addressed to Mrs. Houghton concerning her plans for her future, and she hoped that the letter would be written to her. In January 1849, Mrs. Houghton wrote to her friend requesting that the letter should be sent to her in her house.\n\nOn February 2, 1848, Mrs. Houghton wrote back to her friend, that nothing could have prepared her for such a visit. Later that month, on February 6, Mrs. Houghton wrote to her friend that she had read the letters to her and that she would be glad to read them.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \"The Punchbook Club: Letter to Mrs. Houghton\"\n \"The Punchbook Club: Letter to Mrs. Houghton\"\n \"The Punchbook Club: Letters to Mrs. Houghton\"\n \"The Punchbook Club: Letter to Mrs. Houghton\"\n \"The Punchbook Club: Letter to Mrs. Houghton\"","token_len":389,"entropy":[10.5526,7.0308,5.4714,3.1842,0.0113,3.4516,6.6806,1.772,2.1325,3.1291,0.0187,4.6392,1.4892,6.8404,1.2949,1.937,4.8823,0.0187,0.5936,5.5027,4.7413,4.567,7.16,1.0251,6.362,6.8883,0.6008,1.4104,1.5745,2.7446,1.7046,3.9022,0.9241,3.9644,6.318,2.2794,3.1292,7.1385,0.0343,1.2738,4.7325,0.1837,5.756,6.0625,5.1569,0.4674,1.1245,0.0003,3.2747,5.0973,4.5439,0.4866,4.2472,4.6812,2.2596,0.4092,0.6026,0.0385,0.635,2.2401,1.4643,5.9191,0.3243,0.3685,4.4217,0.0407,4.8674,0.7262,2.7531,0.3018,3.9068,2.704,1.6554,0.7554,2.4421,3.7425,0.0152,0.2693,3.8412,0.2258,1.9295,1.1263,0.4714,1.5251,3.9278,0.5014,1.0683,0.0037,0.2393,0.0117,0.0014,1.6556,1.1577,3.1041,3.8771,6.8053,1.9518,6.5532,1.8401,2.2234,1.7291,1.4983,0.3681,1.671,0.0002,2.9984,0.0019,0.1501,0.0007,0.0032,2.4592,1.6242,2.3266,3.3274,4.1973,2.7197,1.9418,0.9827,3.1918,0.8982,0.7073,0.7312,3.2112,6.0819,3.5558,0.1503,0.8119,1.0685,1.265,2.8329,3.498,1.5424,4.9061,0.964,5.6291,6.2007,1.0785,7.8676,4.102,0.9382,6.5216,5.1364,0.1377,0.5278,1.5614,3.4097,2.718,2.1447,5.1947,0.9142,2.8214,6.0918,1.297,4.3957,2.9462,2.2919,0.0012,8.2707,0.3955,2.2153,0.1518,0.0033,2.4179,3.052,3.4793,1.51,1.6449,1.4696,2.8835,3.6999,2.3261,5.4495,2.0762,1.3917,1.625,0.0999,2.8684,2.3866,4.2307,2.5053,2.1284,4.8376,2.6338,2.4743,2.8616,2.802,1.4284,1.1407,3.0463,0.0802,1.5305,0.0072,0.7527,0.0004,0.0042,8.7933,1.4882,4.2951,0.6411,2.3879,1.3208,2.7784,0.8779,1.9581,4.7608,0.4782,1.6838,1.2547,0.3407,1.8519,6.4533,1.1647,0.9684,2.245,3.6468,4.8233,0.8485,0.7575,0.3218,1.2778,0.0016,0.4328,0.0005,0.0053,1.7439,0.5481,1.2792,0.6313,5.7207,0.7376,1.7497,2.3391,2.6187,0.1757,1.5752,0.4609,0.6251,3.0279,3.5843,3.5478,0.9187,1.2847,0.0002,2.7051,2.2053,2.8849,0.2842,0.5722,2.6095,0.0503,1.1886,0.001,0.354,0.0006,0.0065,1.3498,4.3729,0.3325,1.064,0.0865,1.8862,5.795,8.214,2.7015,2.9568,1.8671,0.0605,0.473,3.8152,0.4558,5.3073,0.7646,5.2013,0.9143,2.2784,0.2169,2.4187,0.9038,2.752,0.0969,1.8764,0.0004,0.0833,0.0006,0.0067,1.0941,0.8398,0.6027,0.293,2.1351,0.5326,1.4416,4.0116,1.1213,3.0644,3.1892,0.9371,2.1943,1.411,0.5192,2.6605,1.8998,2.3654,0.2628,3.2348,0.198,0.8821,1.4276,0.0002,8.0769,0.915,0.0004,5.8832,0.8849,12.1039,1.4071,0.1438,0.0235,0.0916,2.4054,3.5289,1.2028,0.9655,0.0251,0.8627,0.0201,0.0018,2.9989,1.5432,11.236,1.1396,0.1664,0.0058,0.0462,0.8406,0.5635,0.0581,0.495,0.0016,0.5971,0.0009,0.0048,0.6128,0.6821,10.0604,0.7283,0.0766,0.0058,0.0221,0.1037,2.6321,0.6425,0.3895,0.0008,0.0788,0.0008,0.0066,0.1382,0.3526,9.3175,0.4959,0.0336,0.0059,0.0041,0.0388,1.6338,0.0186,0.0914,0.0004,0.0087,0.0009,0.0071,0.0207,0.3701,8.813,0.3566,0.0139,0.0062,0.0044,0.0181,1.1637,0.0025,0.0326,0.0004,0.0032,0.0011,0.0077,0.0079]}

I've been a doctor who has watched people who were born with the number 100 on their wrists (and their hand-eye coordination) become famous... and I'm still saying people with the number 009 are the most likely to be famous.\nI believe that the name '009' was derived from the Arabic spelling \"Zaraa,\" which is a word and not an expression.  That being said, I'd only put the number 009 on the wrist because it's not that big a deal.\nThe name and the place where they're grown don't affect them.   I'm not saying there was no reference to \"009\" here, just that people *aren't* born with the number 100 in their hands.\nThe spelling is obviously in reference to the Arabic 'Zaraa.' But yeah. That's all I've ever known about that name before.\nJust saying you can call or text your doctor if you want to and I'd give you that.\nThat sounds like being called a doctor to me\nThat's what I'm saying, but yeah. I'd call a doctor if I had an illness. Then you would have to call or text the doctor. Like you say..\nIt's a medical term that probably originated from the Latin 'zaraa' but also evolved into the word '00' so it's basically the same thing lol...\nAhh, okay. That's the same thing.

{"id":4099,"ended":true,"length":380,"text":"You have a personality disorder. One personality is the head detective investigating the most notorious serial killer the city has ever seen, and the second is that very same serial killer.\nI don't know what kind of personality disorder you have, so I don't think that would make you happy, but good for you.\nIt probably just has to with the fact that I've never done anything wrong, being a detective I've never been in trouble for anything not related to the crimes I committed. It just seems that people generally have very different opinions.\nI am just a guy who likes and likes things and is afraid of being wronged...so yeah, I'm also a guy who likes and likes things and is scared that I might be wrong about them.   But as someone who never been in trouble for anything wrong you definitely have different opinions. That might be why we all think you're wrong.... And it's always fun to know that I'm wrong. :)\nIf you had any actual feelings or ideas for a guy, would you let him go? Or would you just give up and let him do his thing?\nMaybe let him go. A lot of times, some guys will be cool to let you go if they think you have any feelings for them, so you just want them to be happy for you and not resent you. People always have an opinion.\nIf I could do something for someone who actually loves them, that would be pretty awesome.  If I want to give stuff up for someone who's just going for sex... I don't give away anything.\nI completely agree that giving that free-hand to someone who doesn't like them or don't care about them makes it something that the other person didn't have any idea you were willing to do. Sometimes you also find it hard to understand if you want to give them the feeling you want, because we've always had that sort of thing.","token_len":392,"entropy":[3.7506,2.3294,8.6883,2.2173,2.1978,5.7771,4.421,2.772,3.4142,7.4811,10.021,8.6311,1.8614,5.1369,4.3468,3.2961,0.2583,6.3399,4.8122,0.2382,0.2972,0.3636,2.1165,1.0256,1.3263,3.625,0.5054,4.4713,6.3987,2.8462,3.2887,0.0136,1.5791,1.7821,10.0851,2.7627,0.0006,1.1646,1.9029,4.0625,0.0017,2.0515,0.2549,1.3441,0.6604,0.8937,4.6268,0.8048,2.0052,0.0006,3.0706,2.4564,3.8246,2.7831,2.5553,5.7879,2.4965,0.5948,8.2105,3.6182,0.0817,0.6578,0.7255,3.5994,5.3724,4.4862,3.7899,0.9624,5.7059,1.3929,1.5931,0.0495,2.6681,2.3579,2.2409,3.2712,1.2651,4.3049,1.5877,7.853,1.3536,3.0491,5.1946,1.8228,0.9765,2.0644,2.7425,0.9195,2.7039,0.7477,7.9578,2.4379,0.0175,1.7915,2.9086,1.257,2.2841,0.4025,2.939,2.8127,2.1637,2.3449,3.532,6.789,2.8582,4.13,1.8107,2.1627,2.5433,0.9497,1.6483,4.3113,3.8827,2.3819,3.358,0.9932,3.1085,6.2683,2.6299,3.1363,2.1899,3.8766,6.0312,0.8026,2.9491,2.98,2.4699,6.5123,4.4192,4.5541,0.5794,0.8067,1.7586,6.093,1.0521,1.7974,0.1981,1.1461,1.5906,0.3414,0.7561,1.0479,1.3022,2.5145,4.2466,2.1444,2.7244,1.033,0.1668,3.1027,3.5158,0.407,7.674,5.8348,4.7734,4.7729,3.7493,0.1153,5.5516,5.3653,1.1452,0.1423,1.1866,0.1584,6.007,5.6242,5.3387,1.8097,4.0018,0.4768,1.0647,4.8692,4.8006,0.7193,2.2552,4.9152,3.0752,3.7444,3.2708,0.6927,3.7032,6.7467,6.5648,2.9824,0.831,4.7644,4.0858,0.454,3.7967,1.1219,3.2319,1.3048,2.4064,1.5016,6.5314,0.5494,3.9706,0.4041,2.8787,2.734,7.1182,4.2714,2.4204,4.5964,1.6039,3.3796,5.4726,3.4037,2.8187,0.1373,5.3836,0.4405,2.4019,1.09,3.7033,0.5223,0.2195,2.0996,3.4541,3.5928,1.0762,1.9658,0.5084,4.0301,1.756,0.2772,0.3835,0.8185,4.7853,4.0167,0.1765,0.4352,1.5519,5.4847,1.0892,0.1034,2.1776,2.0257,5.6623,1.6049,2.2332,3.5498,6.1621,3.4372,1.573,2.5277,0.3619,3.879,1.5449,2.3645,0.6568,2.9067,2.7925,1.9113,1.0511,0.1711,1.4463,3.7464,2.8732,2.9912,3.6538,2.5062,0.0733,1.9985,1.5925,3.5352,0.6933,2.2014,1.8003,6.2305,0.5805,0.8145,6.2585,4.4425,2.7547,4.0867,1.3165,2.1773,1.9793,2.9732,2.2568,1.8759,3.3609,2.4643,2.7676,2.9913,3.3567,5.4273,3.222,2.2771,0.5222,4.6234,0.2985,0.1153,4.0689,1.4885,0.5303,3.3965,5.2661,0.6154,5.2356,0.4816,3.0284,7.7691,2.6202,1.7857,1.0826,0.563,2.9589,2.02,3.706,4.3128,7.0039,4.2627,1.7495,3.1138,0.0007,4.8062,3.7183,0.5834,1.1056,1.9374,1.5524,8.0055,1.804,2.1364,5.5089,6.3691,6.8986,4.7631,5.178,1.3616,0.6658,0.7384,2.2948,0.0005,1.6949,2.7565,2.8567,3.6406,0.0002,2.079,0.5534,0.211,3.5273,2.6904,5.9727,1.3906,5.0708,2.0393,0.3345,6.1426,0.0004,2.5255,3.1904,2.055,5.6322,1.7216,5.1229,0.0207,1.7806,0.5713,5.7228,2.1716,5.9553,4.5669,2.0898,2.5602,0.0794,3.8248,4.4901,1.1602,3.3642,0.5316,1.2303,2.4606,3.4068,5.8934,2.1852,1.0328,1.8509,2.0642,6.1148,4.0819,4.6444,1.7148,2.2937,4.38,0.001,1.3865,1.6384]}

It's also something that I love because we get to do and that we can do in our own way, which is what all shows are known for. I've been known to do weird, extreme things in these scenes and I know that some of these have to do and I love that about this show. All the work that we did for this season, I love doing. And the scene that was cut in-camera I loved as much as anyone, because it just looks so much better. And the look at JT's face is pretty amazing and I think that's one of the reasons why I love this show.\"\nDirected by Ridley Scott and starring Brad Pitt, \"The Godfather Part 2\" is set to end a 40-year career that saw him as Kevin Spacey, who was the star of \"The Dark Knight\" \u2014 where he left on a mission to save the movie's world, following a series of tragic events that left him dead.\n\"The Godfather Part 2\" is expected to return to screens on Amazon Prime this fall of 16.\nCopyright 2021 NPR.

At the age of 21 the better one is selected and the other one is put to death.\nI don't think I have ever seen anyone cloned a month into life.\nBecause the clone clone is the clone of the parent of the child of the parent.  It\u2019s not genetic. But it\u2019s more like a variation of the parent\u2019s DNA.  And because the clone clone is the parents of the parent, this is genetic. At the age of 21 if the parent of the clone was a clone of the parent, he\u2019d be only 7th in line (i.e. the clones are about the opposite of identical...) as he is now not as young as the parent.\n> Because the clone clone is the parents of the parental  Yeah, why make the assumption they are identical?  Even in cases where the parent is actually that far apart in age, it is plausible there may have been more genetic differences.  I would say the father was closer to the 12th generation than the mother or sister were to their parents, but I would also say the father was much closer to the mother\nI'm not assuming that either of them is exactly the same age.\nOkay, well I mean... The clone clone would be 10 months younger then the parent. But the mom would still be close to the parent. If both of them are the same age I\u2019d say the kid is only 7th.

If the parent was the clone clone and the mother was the clone clone, then who cares if either parent is at the same point of age? The difference is that the parent could have been genetically engineered but had no genetic influence.","token_len":393,"entropy":[6.654,2.3028,10.5856,1.8976,4.8487,1.5688,3.5073,2.0745,1.1645,0.3602,2.3707,2.5107,4.4617,0.3246,5.0991,4.0747,0.982,10.8016,1.208,5.3555,1.3313,3.3334,0.0364,5.0313,3.7672,10.8702,4.3402,1.3891,5.8062,1.5152,2.2351,4.7564,1.949,0.7577,4.3777,2.5692,2.8797,0.5316,1.892,7.2991,3.3318,0.001,1.7592,2.6522,2.2089,0.6699,1.1073,2.6879,5.8085,0.0151,6.4883,6.6469,5.454,3.1018,0.7462,2.0083,6.4472,2.9126,2.6801,7.6634,0.8942,3.168,4.9015,1.8405,0.8268,3.1146,3.3968,0.2781,1.4458,4.6221,0.2905,1.5012,1.363,7.089,10.1466,15.5255,7.7811,2.6332,2.4935,6.3125,1.2229,4.6708,1.4999,0.8731,0.0694,0.0609,5.4677,1.8602,1.4094,6.7107,0.6918,0.8156,2.0385,3.8051,0.0175,1.7509,2.0963,0.4533,2.0583,2.7538,3.2916,1.5077,1.3582,3.4296,0.6394,1.582,4.7786,1.6166,0.192,4.9287,0.9479,4.9422,1.8822,4.4249,0.848,6.4551,0.8267,2.0036,0.0434,1.1417,5.3555,1.4702,1.4536,2.1766,0.3457,0.6789,3.2491,2.0585,3.8303,0.9526,0.4571,0.474,1.0435,2.2083,1.9543,0.0464,1.492,0.7519,6.8215,4.5469,5.0534,1.1203,2.4157,5.1521,3.8864,0.0684,0.0007,0.4733,2.4262,5.5586,1.3271,5.0608,1.4463,8.7165,1.4795,6.9751,9.993,5.2364,2.5658,1.4164,1.5716,7.7081,4.6854,3.5256,0.1634,1.4549,1.2484,0.8999,1.1049,8.6341,5.8687,0.0961,0.0342,0.0182,0.0036,0.0054,2.7506,0.0008,0.0017,9.1377,5.2693,11.2113,0.793,6.3398,6.8905,1.9834,5.7039,5.7418,0.6706,2.3185,0.9896,2.4516,6.913,3.8894,4.3083,0.3277,1.2579,1.4334,0.8967,4.4149,6.2311,3.3736,0.7287,2.9743,1.4477,0.9452,2.0402,1.3806,6.944,5.3168,3.4736,2.33,0.0393,3.1555,3.9196,1.8218,2.4092,2.2081,2.8863,3.6375,2.4368,2.4118,4.8083,2.9113,4.2709,0.3633,0.5509,7.9259,0.1211,3.7164,1.5584,0.4364,1.7056,4.5798,3.5809,3.8668,1.5109,4.771,2.6493,2.2092,1.5324,2.0034,2.4925,2.3627,0.5465,1.3842,2.0362,0.5269,3.7739,1.1116,0.1992,0.3469,5.3183,7.4345,2.7738,3.1528,1.1121,7.2322,0.9516,6.1588,1.4293,1.6926,2.1062,4.6601,0.8903,0.0431,2.0396,1.1565,2.202,6.2563,0.4492,4.8353,2.8002,4.7162,5.0671,5.2349,4.0208,1.5821,4.2608,0.8969,4.9953,4.7961,2.5203,3.3573,0.289,0.7196,1.1218,2.8183,1.95,4.2081,1.3169,2.8639,0.2021,5.2004,0.3542,0.4686,3.0612,1.1983,4.3481,4.1578,1.616,0.2764,1.1801,3.158,0.0208,0.1769,4.0841,8.5967,0.3889,0.6033,2.0182,2.0585,6.2941,1.2582,4.372,1.7481,1.0071,2.601,2.3203,2.9409,4.5786,0.0318,0.5582,3.2751,4.3933,1.2977,1.3467,5.8246,4.904,3.6217,4.8243,3.4109,1.7559,6.9847,5.1232,2.466,1.6449,0.0389,3.0611,3.0561,3.1021,0.5801,0.2717,5.9823,6.7594,2.0614,4.2697,1.9917,1.3663,1.1264,3.0168,1.4617,4.6485,3.0062,0.5973,3.5987,0.5987,0.2496,0.2334,0.1356,0.8458,0.9811,5.8986,2.3364,1.8475,4.0097,1.6191,1.3591,4.5971,1.2942,0.2294,4.1726,2.9701,2.0629,1.2093,3.4353,4.3075,1.5084,1.5744,1.0431,1.22,3.8282,1.6168,1.0514,4.7799,0.86,3.958,4.831,2.3605,2.9225,5.4715,1.6515]}

Like, if they find out through \"evil\" methods (i.e. \"The Holy Wizard\" or \"the Holy Man\"), could they keep it, and use that to make it into something more powerful? Or would they be caught if they found that it was used for good?\nThey would only steal it because it is evil and the way it had been stolen from them would have had to be very bad. Once they figured out how to recover it, it would be powerful to be at the crossroads of a whole new era of evil.\nI guess they could use the BnB version of it or make the BnB system available in most areas instead of a BnB game. Still not sure what the implications would be though since they could do with something that would work for them or for other characters..\nI don't think that would work well at all considering the BnB would only support the basics. Basically just replace them, give them a certain role as well as more action.\nI would think that would be too much interaction. Plus the BnB would only bring more stuff that could be useful to them rather than stuff like a book...  If i think only of the BnB maybe it would only allow the combat to be that way but we wouldn't have the same levels.\nHow about a level in which the protagonist works as a bib thief, and the combat goes off?

When you have a human race of humans with superior technology then the end product of all science is what will happen.","token_len":394,"entropy":[2.6222,8.2167,0.5904,0.1687,1.9199,4.4241,0.3713,2.5835,9.6838,4.48,5.1231,3.1785,6.8402,3.0497,0.0663,1.5926,0.7139,7.8058,0.1276,4.1279,5.7055,1.5364,7.2972,4.5772,3.2914,5.0842,3.6677,2.0179,0.7937,6.3483,9.1491,1.5308,4.8169,10.3241,4.1951,0.0246,8.8223,2.7557,0.6834,2.1612,0.0123,2.2778,4.4477,1.216,2.2631,1.6778,2.3163,3.4446,1.2011,5.9945,2.6505,1.1389,2.265,1.7444,3.841,0.0005,3.8926,0.0037,3.2927,1.4945,4.2097,1.9757,3.623,3.6197,0.5087,5.4292,2.8902,0.0183,4.384,1.3358,2.832,1.0468,2.2005,2.5546,5.2422,0.2753,0.9812,2.8498,3.8398,0.2083,6.734,5.3317,1.3308,4.4334,0.9543,2.0719,2.2505,6.4928,2.5327,2.0876,0.4147,0.929,3.8068,3.0947,0.9517,3.4665,1.9187,5.1341,1.6204,0.9141,0.0254,2.4532,0.4726,0.6425,5.2162,3.7136,1.1853,2.5592,1.9598,0.4039,1.6674,0.4591,0.2108,2.3208,3.8079,1.6377,0.0003,3.511,2.1064,5.397,2.226,6.2669,8.9718,3.8694,1.0239,4.2118,0.8195,2.2769,1.8192,3.0502,0.3181,3.2735,4.414,1.252,3.5689,0.4186,1.014,2.411,4.027,1.4878,3.3194,0.5458,3.4666,6.7624,0.0055,0.7509,4.4701,4.8001,5.505,0.4067,2.2978,2.3518,0.6854,1.9045,1.0837,0.0042,2.3304,1.9726,5.4259,1.2236,5.5589,0.8422,4.3753,0.9517,4.8788,4.1998,2.8484,5.0476,2.0486,8.3593,5.3227,1.7691,3.2914,0.3359,0.381,1.06,0.0002,3.7995,2.5432,0.6372,3.4971,2.8115,5.4156,3.7534,4.2725,6.0676,3.2817,5.0679,1.4262,3.0229,1.3179,2.1533,0.0002,2.5168,0.2663,0.3154,4.2483,2.9495,0.8768,1.5235,2.3413,0.6001,0.8025,5.9423,4.6462,3.21,1.9379,0.3179,7.1161,2.5624,0.5763,1.0875,3.6793,4.0188,4.3143,4.2786,0.0168,0.3856,3.0408,1.3724,1.6629,3.061,2.016,0.1088,3.3771,6.7593,5.6022,5.2794,6.8649,1.7304,0.8305,3.8115,6.1046,0.557,1.4411,0.0003,2.1573,5.13,1.051,6.1107,0.8537,1.8876,3.7768,1.8997,1.7095,5.9999,1.4265,1.7509,0.5533,3.4042,3.0081,5.402,0.8076,0.2247,0.5758,4.6857,0.8085,3.9558,4.8717,1.616,5.8948,1.9435,1.3073,2.1527,1.6265,4.0221,0.7904,9.6378,0.94,0.0003,2.0082,4.3498,0.5761,1.6372,5.3923,3.4515,1.1004,1.7409,0.4396,0.9314,3.0258,3.9533,1.9567,0.7207,4.3385,1.2634,0.1521,1.186,1.3976,3.3902,1.22,5.9021,3.7658,6.746,0.9666,2.8223,0.3617,0.8474,2.2862,3.8509,0.9422,1.9783,3.5547,0.8248,3.934,6.9753,2.1221,1.4308,0.5616,4.2088,5.0834,4.5139,6.6433,0.7954,4.2997,5.2736,0.3223,1.0363,1.1567,3.3456,4.6211,2.4707,1.0034,5.1824,0.5327,0.167,0.3934,2.6558,2.4243,2.3837,8.3492,0.7882,6.2978,0.3257,1.7565,3.0506,0.3995,1.8298,2.7589,5.1895,2.8628,0.5437,0.0267,0.1065,0.3487,0.0003,3.829,1.058,6.4762,2.1651,2.9498,2.6303,0.9499,3.3101,2.4914,2.1238,1.91,0.5932,6.878,0.0046,3.7936,2.7693,4.2687,5.4335,0.1375,0.0314,1.8454,2.062,0.3782,0.6303,5.4738,2.9125,2.9158,1.6731,3.4498,1.5359,4.5112,4.0667,3.2783,5.1992,0.4897,4.7229,2.4093,5.389,4.8995,1.406,3.9503,7.1258,1.163,4.9441,3.0746,2.7456,1.4885]}

But she is very far from me, at home, and therefore she doesn't care a great deal about her friend.\n\nThanks!\n\nThanks again for the book!\n\nL\n\nDear Anonymous,\n\nThank you for reading it!","token_len":395,"entropy":[8.9316,3.097,2.1091,5.015,7.8499,9.3592,0.705,0.0766,2.2006,3.4038,7.6012,2.1716,2.5645,9.6574,7.8497,0.7364,0.2349,4.4311,2.9596,0.3897,2.2535,2.2221,7.6754,2.0026,8.1097,0.9911,1.8585,3.3611,2.918,1.6354,11.1252,4.3589,6.63,2.6905,7.2015,3.7948,5.5456,8.1254,0.1668,4.1487,0.8681,4.1508,2.1722,3.1554,6.4183,0.4963,0.7407,0.3045,3.4259,5.6776,3.4934,1.159,1.5165,4.7687,2.9274,4.8003,8.1996,1.4819,1.6939,2.3485,0.0615,2.9549,5.074,1.4461,2.1688,4.4858,0.024,5.1725,1.5171,7.7857,1.3334,1.8461,1.7444,0.5738,1.3775,4.0937,1.522,7.0489,1.4454,4.1149,3.5238,4.0061,3.8342,4.1712,6.2267,3.3251,2.5971,7.3595,0.7054,3.5931,4.4787,1.0724,1.892,1.4713,4.9187,6.3019,3.8851,2.2342,3.6113,0.3206,0.9293,6.558,0.2438,1.8711,3.3729,2.8883,0.1814,2.1776,3.9013,4.2353,1.8708,5.9744,0.4052,0.444,2.2962,1.4425,2.4693,1.6554,4.82,2.7966,4.9417,4.9087,0.9193,6.0783,4.9022,2.2281,1.7196,1.4108,2.393,3.9865,0.3703,5.3714,0.788,0.473,0.6905,0.0003,3.2048,1.2522,3.1874,0.2712,2.1147,3.227,0.8832,3.2227,1.4273,3.9138,5.0615,1.594,1.0604,3.4419,1.0765,4.0856,0.458,3.9799,0.0582,3.0703,6.2736,5.8307,1.1414,2.4418,6.3331,0.9368,3.8833,1.364,5.4138,3.212,0.7239,0.0004,3.4782,4.7694,5.7717,5.0565,4.2851,5.2892,1.3567,5.0287,4.649,5.5923,2.758,6.0202,1.7503,1.3563,3.45,2.763,4.521,5.7744,1.8077,1.3984,2.4447,4.6853,1.565,2.5224,3.1571,3.4051,2.0305,1.948,1.0057,2.3215,1.6022,3.7379,2.6007,3.297,0.3836,0.6162,3.2376,4.8818,1.2,4.4165,1.3168,0.6568,1.1296,0.0002,2.2412,3.1146,2.2672,0.3922,2.3685,0.8529,1.8549,1.4781,4.2277,6.1198,2.4506,1.342,2.0766,3.5039,2.266,4.359,3.0678,0.2415,5.3649,0.9265,1.2921,5.7165,0.8556,2.1821,2.6101,2.2891,3.2567,2.3566,1.5911,1.5837,4.7264,4.3341,0.4979,0.4846,3.9938,1.3619,0.6383,0.9453,0.0002,2.9665,4.8301,5.9734,3.9098,5.5971,3.2017,2.7018,1.2767,2.8391,6.1765,4.8831,1.4594,3.4099,6.7468,0.0013,3.0751,0.4368,3.6664,2.4467,2.6999,2.3354,5.1215,4.454,5.8829,0.7111,0.837,1.8278,1.2253,5.0322,0.0011,2.3554,0.1824,2.4033,1.2629,0.8167,2.8283,0.9567,0.0002,6.4193,4.9067,0.0002,4.6917,7.7593,0.6146,0.1825,0.0001,4.2585,0.3392,4.0552,2.6374,1.7984,3.5218,1.831,4.3225,4.3287,3.6304,5.8033,1.9583,0.232,1.6702,2.6082,6.0399,3.9533,2.1201,0.9004,1.9301,4.822,0.0809,2.3627,8.287,4.128,5.4628,1.2431,3.7179,2.0559,3.8436,1.401,1.4996,0.8406,0.3763,1.299,3.1374,4.4084,2.8279,1.1567,3.2798,1.5364,1.447,1.0894,5.0984,1.2063,3.5765,3.7514,1.4626,2.4972,5.3097,0.5168,3.2181,1.0978,5.9326,6.8722,1.3554,1.0382,5.6565,2.3745,3.6312,0.0014,3.8457,5.2897,2.6289,0.0035,0.5195,3.1838,2.3603,1.1941,1.0577,0.0002,4.4524,4.0054,0.3162,0.0002,5.7196,2.2221,1.0347,2.2343,1.8026,1.7186,0.767,0.0002,4.7656,0.7752,0.0001,1.1263,0.5317,0.0846,0.0177,0.0001,2.8412,0.0179,0.4115,3.6276,2.9027,2.0232]}
{"id":4390,"ended":true,"length":367,"text":"Bear Grylls and Gordon Ramsay swap shows for one episode.\nI don't know, it's funny. I thought a season three of \"The Bachelor\" didn't have any spoilers, but a season 6 was probably just as bad, if not worse.  \"A New Hope\" season 8 had some of the worse scenes so far though.    And \"In Rainbows\" season 8 was definitely worse than this season.\nI don't know, if I recall correctly, every season of \"The Bachelor\" aired on ABC as a new house show so the viewers didn't even know that the season finale had been broadcast on ABC.   And as much as I loved this show, its not one I would recommend watching after a season finale.\nI really thought a season 4 of the \"The Bachelor\" was better than season 1.   I mean that is in most areas, though.   The last few seasons felt like they all felt like they had to do a third season in order to work for a full season.    So that and I think season 5 wasn't bad considering the other seasons\nI'm not sure exactly which season 4 is better, but I do agree with you. I mean... The \"Bachelor\" season 4 is definitely better overall. But the \"In Rainbows\" one is pretty far and up there right now.\nHonestly I think I just prefer the season 5 finale of \"The Bachelor\" to \"The Bachelor\" season 5 (which both seasons are), but then again, season 4 didn't need to be aired in order to get into the finals.\nFair enough.    Personally, I think Season 5 would be too rushed and rushed to have a \"Season 6\".    Plus it would've been good if each episode would have like eight, but that is not the case of season 5.  And it would have been a whole lot more entertaining.","token_len":396,"entropy":[11.2378,2.3022,0.4285,3.3676,8.1569,3.2429,11.9545,5.717,2.1379,3.7415,6.1452,2.9721,0.9256,13.585,3.2743,0.0007,0.875,3.329,2.5977,0.6955,3.3752,1.1049,1.6808,4.1937,5.029,4.0541,2.8237,1.7545,2.8856,1.8468,4.3606,0.0442,5.4652,0.0003,1.7688,2.3408,6.4399,1.509,0.6208,4.7148,1.3247,6.6436,3.5417,4.4028,3.3173,2.6427,2.188,2.2503,1.3998,0.0143,0.3541,1.7015,7.6048,10.3858,4.7072,5.3505,1.9466,0.1283,5.8009,4.2889,3.627,2.6835,4.1151,0.3074,5.8984,4.3032,6.1301,0.1667,6.2675,0.8695,2.0013,5.0802,3.3092,3.5079,2.3363,5.8595,5.9569,0.0192,0.1959,1.5529,2.1227,1.6982,4.2827,2.6438,1.7949,4.6934,1.8925,1.0888,1.3846,2.1703,2.3902,0.0009,0.493,1.0252,4.0023,1.7136,6.3923,0.1616,0.4192,5.7519,0.908,0.9826,0.6569,0.368,0.0531,0.0281,4.8596,1.6131,2.862,5.0666,1.9723,5.3159,6.6225,0.9692,4.5105,3.3288,6.3206,2.8396,0.0008,4.2295,0.2778,2.0407,2.1112,2.6316,3.7143,2.2877,1.2473,4.8186,2.0955,1.6143,0.4484,0.3499,0.9686,2.5227,4.7296,3.8137,0.0703,0.3899,2.8302,2.7389,1.3516,0.7506,5.3311,4.1919,5.493,1.6176,2.0776,3.3529,2.1122,5.3075,2.6512,1.4436,4.2736,0.6302,1.8579,2.0463,3.9822,4.4332,3.898,0.526,2.7402,1.2405,2.3386,3.3113,1.3361,0.0749,0.0149,1.5423,2.0915,0.4817,2.5349,2.0896,1.5419,0.289,0.439,2.3794,3.1133,4.2192,4.0612,6.0102,5.2392,6.8666,1.7921,5.0402,1.5297,0.4208,0.5281,3.3826,3.9818,2.8636,0.5986,5.3637,0.7706,1.6167,5.6067,1.6852,0.7235,1.1556,2.3099,2.0041,3.0725,2.0477,5.2489,0.3069,3.5778,0.0908,0.2067,4.6604,4.2412,1.6096,4.0021,0.2334,0.7675,0.1602,0.1668,1.8754,3.3514,3.4857,7.2975,3.7157,1.73,2.7508,1.8024,5.9806,0.0009,3.892,6.328,1.6464,4.4955,2.407,8.2802,1.9768,3.1417,1.2974,0.9043,5.3369,3.9271,0.8538,2.7984,3.6352,1.261,0.905,0.5398,1.069,2.8087,3.9158,0.9717,1.8768,1.8625,3.4123,3.1362,5.643,4.5205,3.6436,1.6112,0.1144,0.0866,1.7639,1.231,2.9087,3.6435,0.5974,5.8461,0.9729,4.9142,2.4753,1.6477,2.511,0.0056,0.0003,0.0133,4.8834,1.6024,4.2009,4.6618,5.5352,5.846,2.7082,5.9357,0.3361,0.3234,1.4945,5.7455,2.9985,1.6797,3.1025,3.3723,6.4466,1.4116,2.4411,1.8553,2.2262,2.2603,0.5949,0.5247,0.0947,0.4807,1.2439,2.717,1.3441,1.0091,2.058,0.7022,2.3739,4.5471,2.0039,6.7954,3.2772,2.5097,8.2779,1.5175,4.4131,0.7031,0.8712,3.7935,1.4828,4.2005,0.0007,4.904,1.2168,1.1062,4.6249,2.7144,0.7714,0.2765,3.4467,3.7284,0.9655,3.3404,0.6286,2.1087,8.6438,0.4516,0.6926,1.1028,1.4113,1.5395,7.8955,0.6087,0.1636,1.6183,3.0004,0.6994,3.6319,1.7282,5.8494,5.3234,1.6016,3.475,2.215,3.5308,2.2707,4.2597,5.698,1.8914,4.3845,0.3584,0.1262,0.6528,5.0065,2.8591,1.4917,3.2077,0.6528,4.4739,1.4124,6.0833,1.822,3.644,0.893,7.4542,4.729,5.0749,1.4682,2.1165,2.7497,1.5091,1.6865,0.1356,5.8164,2.2948,0.6057,0.4161,0.2849,6.5645,2.9455,1.2477,1.4006,0.3363,2.8417,4.4004,0.3249,1.7675,3.7993,1.9332]}

We will work to make children have fun and find meaning in this world,\" he said.","token_len":397,"entropy":[8.3639,1.8863,3.9423,1.9397,10.7582,19.2885,7.9043,3.4989,7.9737,5.6375,5.387,1.5204,11.236,2.5182,2.4577,1.5352,0.2637,1.0316,6.4085,0.5092,3.0476,1.151,2.6902,3.366,0.5413,2.5343,12.3461,10.2317,4.6019,6.7122,1.6638,2.0819,2.2585,1.5,8.4025,2.5211,4.1596,3.4959,7.1339,4.6216,8.0259,2.532,2.1447,1.8533,3.7428,4.1114,1.9096,2.6124,4.6189,6.6213,7.3816,0.6644,6.8725,8.3261,1.2591,0.4474,1.4548,3.5377,0.1921,5.0537,3.387,1.7537,1.5332,4.9647,3.0297,0.0029,0.2034,7.5034,3.0398,0.0037,0.5878,4.4336,1.5744,5.1693,4.8538,3.917,3.7752,3.0685,1.0705,4.1649,1.8884,1.4776,1.3832,1.0103,1.9901,2.0688,1.6015,0.1627,4.0653,3.0952,2.3657,5.3797,2.4983,2.2413,2.936,1.6405,1.2489,0.0006,2.8948,2.7961,4.601,0.7701,0.6957,2.7546,0.1027,5.6496,0.79,1.1074,1.9281,4.1392,2.1206,4.3245,2.6557,6.3962,2.3876,6.6746,1.4643,3.7109,0.8535,1.0056,0.0004,2.1395,2.8815,7.34,0.0651,0.3395,3.578,0.7137,1.1058,3.0793,0.5873,5.1149,4.1318,2.9342,8.3295,4.2515,4.1043,1.9654,2.3241,0.0257,3.1235,2.3844,0.081,4.079,1.8968,4.3633,0.3003,0.0802,0.1674,1.1798,0.0003,2.9683,1.8001,1.9403,0.2267,0.1539,0.4163,0.0006,0.0754,0.8108,7.3895,1.4807,2.1399,3.1971,3.7681,5.0395,0.0057,2.7475,4.1357,5.8106,1.0045,1.0046,0.9603,3.7506,0.7168,3.1625,2.9428,1.1217,1.0921,6.3944,4.5809,1.8719,4.2855,6.4458,3.6458,2.4144,2.0295,0.6544,1.9719,1.777,0.5188,3.3012,7.3077,0.7854,5.6716,3.9218,0.6333,0.2327,0.0003,6.0336,4.2454,0.1941,4.0265,0.9602,0.0178,2.79,4.4247,1.0582,2.4103,0.5643,0.2868,0.0279,5.5234,0.3329,7.4722,0.2392,4.1323,1.308,2.51,0.001,4.7403,0.0033,0.0136,0.0033,1.6421,0.0018,0.0673,1.8956,0.2864,1.1359,0.0003,2.5572,2.4129,2.7753,1.9296,0.0087,0.2141,1.1559,2.1081,0.0004,0.0055,0.0053,6.3063,0.1838,1.7988,3.3788,4.4568,5.8132,5.0525,0.6193,1.1215,7.9884,0.521,1.8922,6.2358,8.6542,0.7466,1.452,0.9168,0.0004,5.3134,0.6658,3.1564,2.8549,0.4047,3.6598,0.4965,0.2594,2.8755,4.3026,1.1819,5.0026,0.8577,4.5094,0.5227,5.1316,0.6868,2.1693,0.9021,1.9931,3.0148,1.3618,2.1645,0.0003,0.0655,0.0603,2.6572,7.6326,0.0003,6.5786,0.0016,0.4455,0.5732,2.4255,3.4207,1.3642,4.4169,0.2954,4.2586,4.7168,3.528,1.4968,2.3811,2.5824,3.1486,0.1248,4.0429,3.3616,1.5301,0.9442,0.5811,0.2619,0.0003,3.3235,0.0005,0.1502,0.6314,1.6031,3.7002,0.6584,3.108,1.8854,0.2442,3.5518,1.1647,1.3298,3.2168,1.6038,5.8442,1.815,1.8995,2.9256,2.582,2.7459,2.9019,4.6308,1.1341,0.1929,4.0697,5.3747,5.0922,1.1208,1.5933,3.1007,0.2797,0.0002,2.5861,6.334,1.2905,0.2299,1.4172,2.8895,4.8827,0.8071,5.8942,1.5264,4.6546,5.8362,3.1278,3.9739,2.6598,0.0074,2.0492,0.342,0.0002,1.8341,5.2784,3.8166,2.3544,4.159,5.8184,4.6497,2.8962,0.7731,2.2233,2.8881,2.8183,6.6147,2.6299,2.7964,4.7401,1.0562,1.4301,6.8363,4.8491,3.7931,1.4716,4.6984,4.7183,0.5266,3.3828,1.1649,0.7613,0.4154,0.0294,0.0685]}

Then my mechanic came down to take me out to the car shop and I could have the new engine repaired right away after my car had been replaced...

It is a short summary with a short section where you'll know that all the detail has been discussed and I'll give you a guide on how the book goes","token_len":397,"entropy":[9.9962,6.0726,14.2001,7.0085,4.5998,14.6139,4.509,5.9973,6.7364,0.854,6.7018,0.0701,1.3674,6.1864,4.0825,4.1333,2.298,3.7865,0.1947,2.3214,10.4741,1.8048,0.0001,2.6409,9.7792,5.7859,9.6698,0.9886,3.5816,0.0849,3.252,5.6275,3.4104,2.5192,4.4238,4.4284,3.0091,3.6989,2.362,2.2226,5.6632,3.592,3.7443,2.1548,8.4854,3.8995,1.7189,4.0306,4.305,0.9976,2.2904,0.0003,1.9147,4.5751,0.4781,0.7942,5.451,2.6735,2.8327,2.6969,4.928,0.82,0.8686,2.5097,1.897,4.6432,1.0053,5.8005,6.6504,6.6417,5.8849,5.0927,4.6226,4.2055,2.5421,2.1994,7.045,0.2492,0.631,0.0004,5.125,3.6791,2.4819,3.6655,1.5804,5.1757,1.7316,1.0601,0.0086,3.4605,3.5386,1.4278,2.923,0.3562,3.1895,3.542,1.6563,3.0983,4.2763,3.2024,3.4474,1.8179,1.8958,0.9561,0.0003,3.525,1.2656,3.8829,6.1579,2.5545,4.5841,2.0343,1.7576,1.9642,4.3012,0.0007,6.0997,0.0831,5.0964,0.0796,5.4406,2.6399,0.6927,4.1343,0.8039,1.8925,1.7173,0.0171,3.5982,1.297,0.8063,0.5324,0.0003,4.4138,3.6313,3.9645,4.694,2.8992,1.352,4.3877,2.9778,3.103,1.7021,0.6676,0.0003,3.6559,3.5881,2.1928,4.5906,8.77,5.3173,4.2629,1.5264,5.3452,3.4265,4.842,2.1718,0.8237,0.0003,2.7478,4.061,4.5618,0.6747,1.4381,0.5607,0.7518,3.919,1.3619,0.9533,2.8781,2.7736,5.1716,2.8591,4.0507,3.4903,1.7869,0.0556,3.3983,4.2994,0.906,4.8333,0.5086,0.8284,0.0003,1.8707,3.4294,4.4693,1.8937,3.3702,1.6932,5.9955,0.5825,4.3738,6.4628,1.5751,0.0004,4.1221,1.1183,3.0692,1.6993,3.6669,2.4525,0.9746,1.5486,0.4087,3.4934,4.192,1.7047,2.1126,0.3264,0.4187,0.7676,4.1223,0.4526,3.755,0.9875,1.6841,3.9093,3.968,4.2847,1.2897,3.3154,4.1473,3.554,1.4258,3.8253,4.4952,3.8044,4.041,0.9137,4.2548,3.3617,0.2216,4.1828,2.0851,3.4342,2.7102,2.5411,0.3765,1.349,6.207,1.8824,0.6354,3.9576,0.5188,3.4573,6.6456,0.0002,4.4369,3.006,2.2961,0.1039,1.2929,2.2028,4.5464,2.2488,0.1606,1.1818,3.2532,4.2638,0.0002,5.9056,0.0071,6.1484,2.5987,6.6235,0.8839,3.299,5.4192,0.7825,0.9456,0.3424,0.6334,1.5781,0.0002,2.1617,1.1262,1.6832,4.0564,1.6106,1.5794,6.3826,0.0371,4.3048,1.0141,1.6722,5.3207,1.3468,0.648,2.3894,1.7284,1.7401,2.0672,5.539,2.3822,2.5805,3.8444,0.0966,1.7151,1.1417,3.2198,1.757,3.5146,4.2063,2.9615,1.0912,1.9853,5.6263,1.9046,0.5992,2.0143,0.9581,0.5347,5.279,6.3237,0.2819,0.0004,3.9713,1.4597,0.0033,2.7388,5.6946,0.3844,0.6996,0.6133,0.0002,2.8879,1.0145,1.4349,2.1244,1.2193,5.2063,2.1566,1.3718,0.7473,3.2979,3.0117,0.5895,5.3844,3.3472,1.5311,1.9683,5.6304,5.6762,5.0129,2.6256,1.0817,1.3252,2.7105,4.4182,0.9637,1.1974,0.7651,0.0002,1.6689,2.1901,2.017,0.1372,0.6041,0.3418,0.1626,0.9839,0.0528,0.4905,0.5976,3.0337,0.2258,0.9036,0.0593,0.0448,0.0283,0.0299,0.0057,0.0028,0.0025,0.0135,0.0048,0.0158,0.0275,0.0034,6.5688,0.0238,0.0006,0.0058,0.0202,0.0074,0.0273,0.0022,0.0003,0.0046,0.0041,0.0033,0.0012,0.0057,0.0039,0.0022]}

{"id":3099,"ended":true,"length":393,"text":"The year is 2050, Kim Jong Un has died in his sleep with no known children. In desperation, the North Korean Government seeks out his next of kin. They find him nestled away in the heartland of the US, North Korea, in a forested region. The North Korea that was born in 1950, the world\u2019s first country, is now undergoing an era in which it has the largest nuclear arsenal and the North Korean regime has no chance for new development. The North Korea that was not born in 1950 has become a totalitarian system that enjoys the sole advantage of economic and political advancement. At the height of the Korean War and the war in Vietnam, it was believed that the North Korean regime could use only one type of atomic bomb to destroy American cities, but only if the United States and the USSR reached a negotiated understanding to end their Korean War. The North Korean regime has successfully executed its atomic program in recent times with minimal effort. In addition to the numerous weapons that North Korea has developed in order to expand its nuclear and missile capabilities, it has also developed a sophisticated and durable nuclear weapons system. The North Korea also has the capacity to produce nuclear weapons with a potential range of 50, or 845 kilometers, which, according to the North Korean government, is comparable to the size of a nuclear bomb. The North Korea where Kim Jong Un is born\nNorth Korea will use the same technology as it has developed for decades, and it will also use nuclear weapons in the event of a war with its neighbor. In February 2017, when the US invaded North Korea, the North Koreans fired ballistic missiles at the US embassy in Tokyo. The assassination was the second such attack that the North Korean leader had a successful year. The government in Pyongyang has vowed to continue the efforts by the US administration to control the situation in North Korea.
