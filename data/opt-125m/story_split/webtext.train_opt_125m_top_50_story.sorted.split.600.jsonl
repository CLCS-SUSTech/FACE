{"id":228,"ended":false,"length":530,"text":"God holds a press event, admits he's always secretly hated humans.' - Pashtuns\n\nShare via e-mail\n\nChennai, Sep 23 (IANS) All the leaders of Tamil Nadu on Thursday took out a photo of God holding a press conference at King's College, Chennai speaking of the sins of the people of India against the Hindu holy religion.\n\nGandhi was said to have held a press conference during the Independence Day celebrations on September 4.\n\nHe later said that he was proud to be a part of the 'prayer of the people' of India, which was done here in 1991 because the 'human race as a whole never ceases to evolve', a remark that was widely interpreted as hint at a possible political settlement with India.\n\nHe also said that his religion was a faith that was 'procedurally oriented and that is in line with our moral aspirations'.\n\nOn the occasion, Professor Dr. Vidyut Manchandra Reddy, a fellow at King's, said that Gandhi wanted to promote a Christian belief that 'God is man and that the human race as a whole never ceases to evolve'.\n\n\"God, we do not have as long as we wish. We are all a part of God and it is our duty to fulfill all God's promises to those who wish and we do that by doing our best,\" he said.\n\nHe also urged parents to educate their children on the importance of God in all life activities and that the government should take a 'positive view' toward the religion as a religion.\n\n\"At the same time, the government should take a positive view on the god of the people and also towards the religion so that it promotes peace, equality, harmony and love.\n\n\"This can only be a good thing, but the God of the people of India must always be the one who holds the signpost in every culture along with the signpost of the sacred Indian nation. God is not only a spirit that holds in its possession; God is also a true love,\" he said.\n\nThe King's College campus is built in a site which would be converted into an Islamic library and a library for the public.\n\nIt would be used for education and workshops on various religions and the various religions, including those by the Indian Council of Research\/Teachers Union and other institutions, according to sources.\n\nAccording to researchers, religious education in the country is rife with religious extremism and indoctrination.\n\nEarlier this year, President Ram Nath Kovind

{"id":1688,"ended":true,"length":545,"text":"A normal day, 50,000 years from now, the earth will be full of asteroids, comets, quakes, asteroids and plagues, asteroids, black holes, and much, much more. There will be much, much more than that. But it will have to be on Sunday night (Monday, Feb. 1). The US military has proposed a mission to capture those elements, and the Pentagon is still searching.\n\nThe answer to this question is simple.\n\nIt makes plenty of sense. On Jan. 4, 1999, the Soviet Union released a special list of asteroids that could have had the capability of killing humans.\n\nBut on Dec. 31, 2005, the first one occurred at 10:46 a.m. CST, just a few minutes after the New York Times revealed the Pentagon had proposed a mission to capture the red dwarf asteroids in the sky\u2014a designation that was later changed due to lack of sufficient data.\n\nNASA has proposed a manned mission to rescue these small particles, or colloids, from the debris themselves and to take them to Earth and send them off toward our home planet Jupiter.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the sort of thing we need as part of the US\u2019 Mars Exploration Program.\n\nThe first flight of these comets was completed in June 2006. But the mission was stalled out until after midnight (Jan. 19), when the asteroid went down.\n\nSo NASA is trying to convince the space agency to postpone that NASA-sponsored attempt (which the Pentagon claimed didn\u2019t go through). Instead, it has proposed a NASA-supported mission to rescue these little comets from their \u201cblack holes too big to fly\u201d mission.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a flyby mission (which can only be flown once each year), but an asteroid mission with all of the necessary ingredients to fly around it.\n\nThis is the first successful landing on the asteroid belt, and is likely to be the last space mission that will fly. So it is unlikely that it will be able to fly around asteroids.\n\nAnd, while the mission could be profitable, the Pentagon is still desperately trying to save the life of the comets.\n\nIt is important to remember that asteroids can always be brought back to earth, because those comets are highly destructive. They can be made to blow up buildings, water bodies, and rocks in a matter of years, creating the type of destruction that would kill off millions. And since those comets have a small chance of escaping the asteroid belt and settling in the Earth\u2019s own habitable zone, they often stay where they are instead of trying to flee in orbit around the asteroid belt.\n\nSo, the idea of an asteroid mission has more appeal than they should have originally appeared. The military\u2019s proposal is still in the offing, so NASA is still doing its best to get those comets back safely to Earth.","token_len":602,"entropy":[9.1293,4.2017,2.2041,8.0732,3.3051,0.1953,4.9807,3.744,0.0623,0.4462,2.2618,3.5338,0.6381,0.9455,3.9286,0.0528,5.7398,1.5353,1.0141,0.001,0.4868,7.1809,0.6283,0.4635,2.9163,1.608,6.2303,2.9333,2.0357,5.5429,2.3504,5.5963,0.079,0.517,2.6565,4.2587,2.7811,0.0295,0.0965,0.3524,4.3955,0.7907,0.1793,5.0861,1.9388,0.0198,0.3668,3.8998,2.5498,0.7413,3.9373,2.7004,0.9119,4.5139,0.8754,0.831,5.2974,8.1957,3.6236,5.0669,4.4672,2.1633,4.3763,0.325,3.2796,1.8527,2.8593,6.8818,3.594,2.1508,6.0949,1.4517,5.8524,0.5082,5.1192,4.5297,6.7474,1.9146,1.7826,2.3823,4.1603,1.3669,4.8926,5.4107,2.8535,1.3689,0.0005,2.1091,6.4113,1.3688,1.852,0.8705,0.7192,2.4437,1.2784,3.3142,0.0001,3.4306,6.066,7.7698,0.0608,0.0114,0.638,4.5998,4.5094,0.0081,3.4353,0.1873,5.6083,0.0827,1.1909,4.7525,0.0676,5.1556,1.1896,5.9166,7.1973,0.1223,2.8248,1.4543,2.2358,3.6415,5.2669,3.7661,4.8202,1.8248,3.5088,2.2679,0.9537,2.5088,0.0001,3.7939,3.1692,3.928,0.0024,3.5102,0.0549,5.5319,0.048,0.8623,4.8146,4.1815,6.2231,4.1802,3.5736,0.43,4.1634,0.8028,0.0003,0.0004,0.3663,4.4763,1.5463,2.5277,2.4063,0.5146,1.6594,0.8064,0.9364,5.2346,0.8809,0.2585,5.0917,1.3087,4.4903,1.9052,3.6042,1.117,0.7281,0.406,0.6377,1.498,7.605,1.8677,4.9542,3.6886,1.6387,3.5093,6.1694,2.0819,5.7454,0.8139,2.4396,2.6491,1.2697,6.2491,0.0018,5.4907,0.0011,5.3538,1.8585,0.7147,0.477,0.0001,4.8538,2.6342,4.6612,1.0565,4.8046,0.3306,0.2924,6.4754,3.5068,5.484,4.3693,1.5163,4.0977,6.0198,3.0371,0.397,1.131,1.0974,3.3907,8.9481,3.7582,2.8087,3.5095,0.7389,0.8989,1.5264,3.7323,2.5322,0.1391,4.9025,5.1754,4.2704,3.0942,0.4007,9.6417,0.4185,1.0903,0.0002,3.5731,18.365,8.4544,3.741,3.9691,2.7135,1.9997,0.0006,2.124,2.1323,1.8632,4.6442,3.1585,0.0038,1.6738,4.3401,12.1329,1.0937,9.1816,3.1792,1.0537,1.2179,0.804,0.0002,2.1568,3.6217,5.6611,0.6138,3.3946,4.4815,0.0162,2.4392,4.6898,0.6751,3.8912,2.878,1.2085,3.2743,1.9447,3.2193,1.755,6.4488,5.1801,3.3352,3.8924,6.1648,3.5006,2.7394,0.0147,3.7615,1.5736,1.0939,1.1384,3.8008,5.6287,2.3315,1.0675,1.1428,0.0002,3.5451,2.2809,2.141,3.0851,0.181,5.9703,0.7069,4.434,0.2461,1.012,4.2823,4.5962,6.3988,2.1031,1.8218,5.0431,4.9631,2.443,3.707,3.2077,6.0802,4.6269,4.1836,0.9132,0.437,2.803,2.0746,1.6631,4.7069,0.2745,1.4323,2.21,2.478,0.7663,5.097,0.4701,3.5304,0.4715,0.7587,4.4742,1.3756,5.0255,3.2791,0.0166,1.7807,1.8737,16.6404,4.9179,8.6313,1.4098,8.8814,6.9155,0.3759,3.0413,7.8546,8.9237,7.9967,0.8765,0.2918,0.0002,2.9411,3.4184,0.6527,0.8412,0.8131,1.8414,5.7139,0.5718,2.043,4.5017,3.3143,5.2323,2.818,0.8695,3.6196,2.8407,4.8423,0.4386,1.9922,0.453,3.7743,1.4118,2.4238,4.1284,5.1478,1.9121,0.6417,2.5843,4.1398,1.031,3.6876,4.7766,4.3048,1.2252,0.8112,0.0002,2.9309,1.2046,1.8507,2.5896,4.6721,5.6052,2.8379,2.3705,2.9148,1.6603,1.4318,0.7133,4.116,4.0263,0.8851,0.8471,0.27,1.0031,5.4263,1.0462,2.4318,1.9454,3.4382,3.3657,5.0306,2.3296,1.5393,4.4351,0.9,3.129,0.1568,1.164,4.166,0.0078,2.6966,2.9282,2.9705,1.8719,0.4906,0.0002,3.4006,3.2227,4.4405,1.659,3.5391,3.0399,1.2346,6.9804,0.7153,2.2036,5.5097,1.585,2.3542,6.5469,0.8101,0.0282,3.609,1.8815,3.578,0.0782,1.9362,3.3332,0.1148,0.8605,0.4986,0.0001,3.419,1.3596,4.3588,0.2026,1.4391,0.1978,3.8128,3.244,6.5593,1.0034,5.1841,1.279,0.8221,3.5638,1.9853,4.2087,4.667,0.749,0.0044,1.5243,5.5143,4.6161,0.877,2.5172,1.4512,3.1616,4.9545,0.6132,6.2884,0.1109,4.1872,1.0593,6.8947,3.4633,0.3616,1.8883,5.3082,3.166,2.1779,1.5726,0.0021,5.1652,1.6278,4.8222,3.7178,5.4271,0.0013,2.6347,0.5339,2.6201,2.6942,4.5487,3.2522,1.8381,3.8852,5.2664,2.9238,0.3606,0.0024,2.6708,2.3984,4.0894,1.9422,0.1868,3.6429,2.0379,2.255,0.2298,2.7374,4.9878,1.7727,0.9652,2.9977,6.4677,0.4001,4.9047,5.1322,4.2589,0.1229,0.3255,1.1483,6.1352,4.6569,4.9965,0.0421,0.1229,6.2599,0.0689,5.6197,0.0186,5.2265,4.0006,3.7226,1.597,0.9308,1.2108,1.0754,0.3318,0.1804,0.0002,2.4409,1.5651,2.6992,4.1594,1.6506,2.7498,0.156,1.1221,4.3189,6.3271,4.2891,1.1334,7.2398,3.7278,1.4177,8.4808,6.356,0.4496,3.2874,4.6449,9.484,0.1755,1.4852,2.2832,1.4337,4.8743,2.4411,1.1511,5.0765,0.0035,0.9157,3.6613,3.2118,1.3919,1.7222,5.5624,1.5293,0.7314,0.0852,2.95,4.5095,0.4361,0.0046,1.031,3.3515,1.3495,0.4398,0.2642]}

{"id":584,"ended":true,"length":566,"text":"Write a generally lighthearted and cheerful story that is turned dark by its last few lines\/last paragraph.\n\nThe book is intended to be a simple, honest, and entertaining story. The author has written about his own, and is a small time author, so he doesn't really need to share it too much. I did like the tone of this book; the story told through the end of the book; the characters who were killed, and the ending are really sweet.\n\nIt is a good story to read.\n\nIt makes you laugh and makes you laugh again.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nYou had to try this book. I had to read it because everything I wanted to read on the internet was already there. This was one of the better books I've ever read.\n\nWhat I got:\n\nThe ending was so sweet, but I don't know if that is due to the fact that the book is actually written in a very short time. That said, I still can't shake that feeling of sadness that my readers had to watch or read for that final hour, to enjoy this book.\n\nThe narration was the most entertaining part of the book; the first time I learned this, I went home and heard her scream. I wish I had seen their voices when she tried to kill me.\n\nWhat I got:\n\nThe ending was so sweet, but I don't know if that is due to the fact that the book is actually written in a very short time.

I wish I had seen their voices when she tried to kill me.","token_len":603,"entropy":[4.0641,12.5474,8.7284,3.302,3.5972,5.8958,2.4553,2.8685,2.5575,8.725,7.3346,1.6965,3.7648,8.0712,3.3911,4.0745,7.5045,8.1383,3.889,0.7946,1.53,0.0504,3.2693,4.6759,1.2757,5.6797,0.5554,0.813,1.0149,4.0484,1.7136,4.9178,1.012,1.076,3.4682,2.0131,1.2828,2.2214,2.7188,2.3341,3.1175,3.9753,2.855,2.1796,7.3617,1.965,4.1525,3.2319,6.2467,4.9867,3.9155,1.8166,1.1219,1.9786,3.1638,0.0005,2.4699,2.2927,0.6173,5.1776,2.3068,4.489,0.1642,0.3401,2.7076,4.7096,3.4281,0.9973,4.4282,0.532,2.2052,0.6276,4.4052,2.2051,2.9055,4.6118,2.6196,1.2361,5.2995,0.9067,0.6231,1.2908,7.6248,0.9426,2.7016,3.6797,2.9598,4.1245,2.16,1.6196,1.0345,3.9544,5.273,4.2045,5.9786,0.9814,1.5934,0.0002,3.6261,1.571,1.9684,2.7829,1.7733,2.889,1.2756,2.5352,1.8533,0.0002,3.7996,5.2935,1.9423,2.9886,2.29,5.809,0.1539,3.2904,3.8072,0.4379,0.4433,0.0002,4.9075,4.6411,1.1352,1.1136,0.0002,4.5565,7.0073,1.9527,4.3236,1.092,0.6152,1.8104,2.1546,3.7086,1.0905,1.8486,0.9195,4.1636,6.8825,2.0775,4.2788,0.5044,1.0844,3.9844,1.6035,1.7019,0.8203,4.9169,2.9026,0.6965,3.0792,2.7682,3.5128,0.3346,0.7252,3.6242,0.8062,0.6543,0.8879,1.9825,0.0621,0.6418,1.4546,0.0002,4.7681,0.9933,4.6,1.9406,0.2425,0.0002,2.6942,4.0046,2.2292,3.9531,2.949,2.1063,3.2499,2.0098,3.503,0.0009,1.7588,1.055,3.0551,2.9172,4.1144,0.0127,0.7042,2.2601,0.1952,1.3942,2.5523,1.133,4.5357,2.1818,1.8372,1.8314,2.6248,2.4012,1.1086,2.4862,4.3581,2.8932,0.047,1.2863,3.9929,4.616,0.0766,5.0887,3.1709,1.353,2.3938,3.5847,1.5804,3.7492,4.9149,3.206,3.023,4.5081,6.9505,2.6498,4.4984,2.8918,3.6331,4.4307,3.3991,5.139,4.562,1.6874,0.8594,0.4808,0.8437,0.0002,1.7829,6.0007,0.9969,5.0827,2.2598,3.6934,1.0502,0.5796,0.3681,0.4188,3.0258,1.5127,4.1313,2.7431,0.4113,6.5477,3.4959,1.855,0.4611,5.452,3.4736,0.6334,5.9032,5.7104,4.5699,1.7152,1.3306,5.3749,0.7211,1.2364,3.1784,7.2739,2.8842,2.2571,1.6788,5.5031,0.105,3.9077,1.3019,0.6676,0.9376,0.0002,4.1459,0.3166,1.9056,0.1745,0.0315,0.0002,1.5133,1.4528,0.6754,1.7457,1.1575,0.4401,0.1948,0.1187,0.0949,0.0005,0.0092,0.0232,0.0173,0.0111,0.0376,0.0006,0.0077,0.0005,0.0011,0.0121,0.0032,0.0028,0.0068,0.0061,0.0026,0.0027,0.0031,0.0223,0.0015,0.0039,0.034,0.007,0.0005,0.0046,0.0012,0.0069,0.0,0.0004,0.0032,0.0017,0.0029,0.0049,0.0028,0.0041,0.0085,0.0019,0.0009,0.0036,0.0017,0.0018,0.0009,0.0022,0.0057,0.0097,0.0028,0.0021,0.0008,0.001,0.0011,0.001,0.6006,0.0001,1.5354,2.663,0.0383,0.2768,0.0143,7.4602,0.094,0.0128,0.013,0.0362,0.044,0.3064,3.458,0.5134,0.0568,2.9898,0.2284,0.0298,0.0491,0.5196,0.1467,0.0368,0.1489,0.2776,0.0888,0.0034,0.0827,0.0292,0.0009,0.0042,0.0366,0.0226,0.0028,0.0022,0.0189,0.001,0.0005,0.0027,0.0011,0.0025,0.1222,0.0001,0.7911,0.0259,0.0146,0.0202,0.0092,0.0002,0.4144,0.2543,4.9418,0.2081,0.137,0.011,0.0084,0.0065,0.0236,0.0006,0.003,0.0094,0.003,0.0038,0.0109,0.0005,0.0054,0.0008,0.0014,0.004,0.0015,0.0032,0.0034,0.0022,0.0026,0.0028,0.0028,0.0114,0.0012,0.0008,0.0469,0.0095,0.0005,0.0012,0.001,0.0071,0.0,0.0008,0.0023,0.001,0.0011,0.0025,0.002,0.0054,0.0035,0.0029,0.001,0.0024,0.0008,0.0017,0.0007,0.004,0.0077,0.0073,0.0018,0.0019,0.0008,0.0004,0.0009,0.0014,0.09,0.0001,0.9082,3.1616,0.0099,0.5023,0.3192,0.6358,0.002,0.0026,0.0017,0.0026,0.0027,0.0041,0.0328,0.0009,0.0005,0.0054,0.0013,0.0006,0.0008,0.0086,0.0068,0.0005,0.0062,0.0174,0.0051,0.0008,0.0018,0.0021,0.0011,0.0028,0.0132,0.0036,0.0004,0.0007,0.0109,0.0008,0.0006,0.001,0.0014,0.0014,0.0865,0.0001,0.4379,0.0033,0.0028,0.0121,0.0056,0.0001,0.1836,0.0283,0.9956,0.0059,0.0019,0.0018,0.0031,0.0018,0.0101,0.0005,0.0026,0.0098,0.0029,0.0022,0.0086,0.0005,0.0037,0.0015,0.0016,0.0031,0.0014,0.0024,0.0023,0.0024,0.0047,0.0032,0.0037,0.0075,0.0014,0.0009,0.0287,0.0064,0.0007,0.0011,0.0011,0.007,0.0,0.0015,0.0021,0.0012,0.0007,0.0014,0.0016,0.0062,0.0035,0.0062,0.0011,0.0016,0.0007,0.0029,0.001,0.0062,0.0077,0.0072,0.0011,0.0018,0.001,0.0003,0.0009,0.0015,0.0803,0.0001,0.501,1.1452,0.0088,0.1975,0.1393,0.3832,0.0014,0.0023,0.0013,0.0019,0.003,0.0019,0.011,0.0005,0.0004,0.0026,0.0013,0.0008,0.0009,0.0082,0.0128,0.0006,0.0068,0.0105,0.0033,0.0008,0.0008,0.0019,0.0013,0.0038,0.0105,0.002,0.0002,0.0007,0.0106,0.0011,0.0006,0.0009,0.0014,0.0012]}
{"id":1470,"ended":true,"length":579,"text":"Write a children's story that turns incredibly dark' - WKOW 27: Madison, WI Breaking News, Weather and Sports\nThe author has written about his own childhood, while using two different characters to tell a family story.\nThey share a \"foul blooded\" story for their children.\n\"It started with my mom and my dad and their stories, and they'd be like, 'what's wrong with that,' and I'd like to tell that story and give them something to try and make them feel better. So I decided to create this one,\" says Jessica Bridenstine.\nJessica has a different take on the story. She says to them, \"what do you do when there's violent crime involved in an area of crime? What do you do when there's a black dude getting locked up or beat up in the park because he's black or because he's white or because he's wearing a hat. What do you do when there's a white kid in custody or because there's a black teenager in possession of a gun and there's a white kid in custody.\"\nEach character in the story writes down exactly what happened to them. They then create a movie in hopes that they will get a similar reaction, telling the story.\nTheir movie is made up almost entirely of black kids' stories. To them, that is an image of racialized violence.\nThe writer knows for sure what to expect in this film. But Jessica says the film also reflects that kind of racism in America.\n\"That's the message [of] the movie that it teaches the story of these young people and the people that they go to school with, and that's the message of this film,\" says Bridenstine.\nJessica has written hundreds of stories about kids. She even helped produce the 'Children's Movie' with her husband Paul. Back in 2010, it was still unclear how this movie would fare. The filmmaker then saw his wife's story come true and decided to start making short stories. So he started writing this one.\n\"A little bit of history, we started with a group of people from across the aisle in the same aisle and we wrote this as a short story. If you had a long story, maybe with some little color at the end, and a little color going on, you made a short story or made a story of this woman,\" says Bridenstine.\nBack then, it took around an hour to wrap up the movie. With Jessica's background knowledge and Paul's expertise, the director didn't plan to see how long the story would survive.\n\"No one had the resources to do the movie,\" says Bridenstine. Although the script was written in the 1990s with a budget around $90 million. She says the experience she has gotten through this will be very familiar to her, and it was a natural for her to write this story.\nYou can watch the film at the link above.","token_len":606,"entropy":[4.0641,10.2462,0.2001,2.3744,3.93,6.9535,10.6203,3.1722,8.9968,3.9394,6.8409,5.6412,4.4539,6.7851,4.0357,15.411,2.7964,0.8897,9.3367,1.7316,3.1659,8.2145,3.258,4.7315,2.6499,8.3152,5.5276,3.5426,2.6994,2.6277,4.2046,2.9735,3.4088,2.4187,6.3153,5.9426,6.5364,1.9591,4.5776,1.546,2.7968,1.496,4.8144,0.0609,0.4996,1.4275,5.529,4.1933,1.0365,6.0769,4.9996,6.7481,6.7256,3.8196,1.7734,3.5987,5.3556,2.7053,2.8656,2.2077,0.4748,4.7498,2.5624,4.8579,1.3757,1.9436,3.6304,1.974,1.7104,1.3859,2.4257,4.5951,6.3817,2.8754,1.0857,2.7056,3.7136,2.9877,2.5499,0.5896,0.1502,5.3607,1.8642,1.5775,0.7144,2.6854,4.7245,0.7885,1.0868,0.5116,3.3299,0.241,1.3904,2.9398,0.8229,2.5477,5.0942,1.0776,2.412,0.8274,5.2435,1.3818,2.8748,1.7544,1.8114,1.4167,2.353,2.3447,0.9128,4.3006,0.5239,3.8471,2.4653,4.3024,2.1928,2.5699,6.9201,6.6755,5.931,0.8568,0.0812,1.2734,0.1716,2.252,3.073,2.0325,4.9202,2.9017,0.1133,1.0563,1.2408,1.5858,2.4339,1.2558,6.5559,4.4558,0.4468,0.7226,5.0714,2.7378,0.2625,2.0125,0.903,4.1022,0.3567,10.4998,1.878,6.7381,2.2461,4.5125,2.4016,3.8182,6.7234,1.5006,1.7839,0.7349,0.03,0.1361,0.2747,1.0165,0.2366,1.3862,5.0184,5.9622,4.8014,6.2347,0.1137,4.2957,8.0442,0.3074,2.4442,1.5379,4.3351,3.916,0.849,0.8629,1.2126,2.6933,3.4222,0.6605,0.4384,2.5328,1.77,0.4709,0.3884,0.3073,6.2754,0.5436,3.8645,3.5755,2.1857,0.2808,0.032,0.025,0.2752,0.6791,0.1559,0.9011,2.5383,3.0281,2.7091,6.3668,1.4966,4.4808,3.5003,0.1411,0.485,0.8362,4.489,1.4912,6.3443,0.6487,0.8998,0.637,2.547,3.6342,0.1126,0.7207,1.3808,0.7367,1.0989,1.3038,4.2961,0.0857,6.6014,2.5174,3.0521,0.4866,0.9293,7.3328,3.35,5.0162,0.4254,1.2721,1.9822,0.7182,1.0022,2.7593,2.5632,4.161,0.7081,6.9581,4.3009,6.188,1.3067,1.8147,1.5295,3.2246,1.6437,5.2344,1.9432,3.3183,6.5151,1.3904,0.6133,3.6183,0.3828,5.4205,3.3613,1.2602,5.0863,2.6232,6.8002,0.1626,0.0526,2.7738,2.6534,5.8674,0.286,0.7468,6.3361,3.2544,0.1997,2.6472,2.1048,3.685,5.6085,1.0033,5.8601,4.5337,1.2219,0.8837,0.609,3.1372,5.5855,6.4167,5.1466,0.4003,2.3402,3.5872,2.1271,2.9223,2.8949,3.4438,0.4555,4.5153,3.4306,0.9252,2.9656,2.7724,4.3684,4.6299,3.6051,5.4064,0.0005,2.7752,2.05,2.5436,0.41,0.3328,0.3771,4.1443,0.588,2.4402,3.7527,6.0996,1.1152,3.9218,1.5235,0.9065,3.5305,3.3156,6.3103,3.5478,2.8878,0.9674,4.6435,3.8089,1.5014,2.4869,2.45,3.7044,1.5076,1.6655,3.9281,1.12,0.4684,0.2913,1.7618,0.9697,2.1595,1.074,1.614,0.4994,1.944,2.3324,1.7407,1.7049,1.3765,1.6597,0.0085,0.0006,0.0003,0.0233,0.228,1.6973,3.0567,2.9641,5.9933,0.0292,0.8149,1.5356,5.4909,3.8804,1.3244,4.8481,4.9667,4.199,1.5445,6.3084,5.9463,0.707,4.5267,0.922,3.2682,1.1135,1.7307,5.6942,1.6465,8.0108,0.5525,3.2403,0.3225,5.0281,0.5006,5.4532,5.1343,2.131,3.8934,1.4294,0.4418,4.1638,1.3083,3.2316,4.103,5.0484,6.846,4.1136,2.9578,2.2343,2.1692,6.6656,5.0729,1.2356,1.4741,0.2548,4.3369,2.6053,7.0745,2.7324,1.0073,4.6029,1.6947,2.344,2.7064,5.4514,1.5493,0.654,0.2847,0.8535,4.9821,3.3072,0.8703,0.5759,4.4614,2.1509,4.6828,3.3138,2.1281,1.9392,5.062,0.2197,2.9389,2.6013,5.054,0.3313,8.9102,2.1136,1.5504,4.9419,7.3381,2.6239,1.6858,4.0981,1.71,5.8735,0.5003,3.6366,0.3025,1.9985,6.0677,0.8056,4.2114,1.5387,4.7974,0.5476,1.1927,4.585,6.0201,3.4911,5.6092,4.586,5.5651,0.187,0.3238,0.6088,2.7259,2.6082,1.0527,3.934,5.6614,0.7336,1.1378,1.7676,7.9263,1.4939,2.6355,0.4022,4.9334,5.3281,0.4316,1.8966,2.6561,3.2777,6.2393,2.6328,0.4351,0.7068,0.0022,0.0008,0.0002,0.0307,0.232,6.641,1.4912,0.2579,2.7575,3.0841,5.1461,3.6804,0.0422,0.7604,5.7403,0.7041,0.7451,1.8818,0.3595,5.154,2.3988,1.2353,7.295,6.589,1.3466,7.7647,0.098,4.593,0.4765,1.9829,3.3997,5.2715,0.0003,5.8979,1.2643,6.4995,3.4902,3.2547,1.43,1.6666,0.1817,8.6311,0.4096,0.7814,0.5337,6.3118,1.1598,3.1503,2.5762,3.9588,0.6602,1.2443,2.6472,2.111,2.2106,0.3231,0.4674,0.0021,0.0009,0.0003,0.0444,7.4385,1.6978,3.5261,1.0211,1.6178,1.8545,1.9232,4.5328,0.1464,4.6415,2.2645,4.9406,4.3702,0.1212,4.9339,1.4677,4.0038,4.7787,1.1035,1.7279,5.8084,4.8041,2.2323,4.7622,4.5476,2.4541,6.3652,1.7797,2.6702,4.8073,0.3306,1.4801,3.698,1.514,2.8485,3.3533,2.1648,5.2923,3.8882,0.4066,0.2284,2.4014,1.767,1.9563,0.5397,0.2475,6.2536,0.4435,1.5903,0.7677,2.892,2.2982,1.7464,3.0148,1.7806,0.3798]}
{"id":3668,"ended":true,"length":579,"text":"`` People without a planet. '' 400 words or less. Feedback for every response.`` - P.C.\n\nI'm sure he can solve his problem.\n\nBut what about the thousands, if not millions of people who live on a planet, and still end up living \"unreliably\"?\n\nNo doubt we could find a way to extract some of the natural resources from their ecosystems, if we somehow evolved humans to extract this natural resources. At the very least, if humans and nature are able to extract enough water for food, we'd be able to extract enough fuel for civilization (i.e. the food we'd use).\n\nBut this is a hard problem to solve to. Humans can be successful if they can be \"lucky\", and we can be really successful if we're lazy.\n\nSo we must use all our creativity in the process (and that is in most areas, of course); our brains have all been trained to create a lot of \"lucky\" situations, where we develop a tolerance for bad or good things (just like everyone else and every other life is \"lucky\"), the human tendency to develop a tolerance for bad things (although I'm not sure that's possible in many conditions), or lack of ability to control it (if anything we can just take it out of survival mode; that is, not being able to control other people's feelings about their feelings).\n\nWhat I think you're right: most people can adapt themselves to bad situations. I don't think the \"lucky\" situations (as opposed to the situations that occur in other situations), can be explained by \"creating a lot of lucky\", but by \"abusing it and then being greedy\".\n\nI can understand this, and it's all part of what makes good life so much more. However, you're correct - I was surprised of the extent of his problem (he is now a successful pilot, so perhaps that could be explained).\n\nAnd I agree with you about the \"lucky\" situations. So many people are still trying to learn to accept reality as it is, to overcome what they perceive to be a \"lucky\" situation (like being given a gift, which they must either accept or reject on either side of the same coin, which they must either accept or reject).\n\nI don't know which is worse or which is better; either you can or can't overcome the \"lucky\", you can or you can't.\n\nIf your problem really is how you can overcome it, there's an excellent article about that. On the other hand, I don't think you can get past the \"lucky\", it can be extremely frustrating to find someone who's not averse to the idea of solving a problem, even when the problem is clearly the wrong one.\n\n__________________\nThe old saying \"No matter where you are, wherever you go, you can still make money\".","token_len":606,"entropy":[9.2819,7.3269,2.1352,9.0995,2.549,8.7545,11.0203,6.8004,4.8022,0.9026,0.9759,12.1768,4.4599,5.0608,6.354,0.7003,12.5529,5.129,6.5434,1.9388,3.5248,0.1468,2.8332,0.0795,4.2771,2.7289,3.3867,4.7063,3.9766,5.856,4.4104,1.5182,1.5312,1.9519,0.0006,3.5344,3.1206,1.6012,1.2724,6.6532,4.2777,1.4944,0.0192,0.4343,1.4546,0.8816,0.7759,3.783,1.3392,2.5225,0.7253,3.3621,2.2998,4.126,5.9545,0.0019,3.062,6.9201,3.8446,4.6304,3.1561,0.899,0.8442,0.0002,4.7401,3.8696,3.5653,3.0515,3.5281,1.3294,0.8444,0.3023,6.7403,2.1518,0.8213,1.3125,4.976,1.2828,1.4393,3.696,3.7492,1.2102,4.5469,0.6549,5.6122,6.9453,6.5618,1.5225,6.5433,4.4892,1.9455,2.6099,0.8701,6.1939,1.4552,1.1949,0.0168,0.4126,3.8753,3.5047,4.4851,3.5702,2.2728,3.5398,0.0126,4.2602,3.6023,5.1394,2.7013,5.1293,0.8324,2.1609,2.4415,1.2343,0.5487,0.013,3.0014,1.218,4.9802,0.9194,4.4155,4.3021,4.8629,0.0017,0.0003,1.1426,3.1377,3.6523,1.4769,3.3582,3.7531,2.181,0.8138,0.0003,1.457,3.6148,1.3211,1.9423,4.3365,0.899,0.6455,0.2829,6.5421,6.0865,3.9221,3.1163,4.5504,5.3559,2.2173,0.924,2.3033,3.7753,4.1728,5.1887,0.8462,2.3813,1.6445,2.6499,0.7841,0.5759,6.2281,3.0691,0.1515,0.3063,2.9263,6.1566,0.9295,1.0684,0.0003,2.8102,2.633,3.4537,5.0869,4.1745,2.1953,5.4906,3.9454,2.1667,3.317,4.5925,2.083,4.3219,2.398,5.014,5.1223,4.4132,2.2987,3.9984,0.0256,5.3644,4.6479,3.825,3.7905,4.8358,3.9485,2.0286,0.5452,4.9854,2.5193,4.0316,0.1108,3.1345,2.6875,0.6402,0.1683,2.5116,1.3148,3.3549,1.1185,7.0434,1.703,6.9081,0.8845,4.1507,4.9919,4.8119,2.2505,2.9534,5.5428,0.8865,4.1571,0.1883,5.6038,4.672,0.9279,4.8386,3.7335,3.6334,0.4555,0.0168,3.033,5.5581,4.3379,5.5387,0.4516,4.0537,2.1239,1.0699,0.3022,0.5969,1.4048,1.1761,6.6316,3.2762,1.5874,0.7637,0.5847,1.994,1.3761,4.2009,2.0579,3.5115,6.2165,1.4539,3.2761,6.3119,0.1292,5.539,0.207,4.4401,5.1153,1.3121,4.8208,4.7718,2.8922,2.267,3.3242,4.7747,1.9913,2.2145,0.6491,9.3153,1.9908,4.8426,3.6254,1.8001,0.6023,4.7633,5.5873,0.958,0.003,0.6976,5.8783,1.0203,0.6063,4.938,2.6681,3.0537,3.197,1.5633,0.221,0.0003,4.0035,2.897,2.6844,4.342,1.3947,3.9833,5.0957,5.4927,1.5348,2.9959,4.9396,4.452,0.5965,4.8258,0.879,1.8351,3.4804,2.3246,0.0007,0.6946,3.5548,3.3638,1.3393,0.0222,0.1074,1.8332,4.1777,4.0575,2.8346,0.0044,1.2577,4.7331,1.6255,4.6981,1.2851,2.5783,2.0359,2.6265,3.8988,0.4134,3.548,0.5224,3.1077,5.6157,1.5959,1.6583,3.5645,0.0994,3.9219,4.6092,2.1983,2.3384,1.3649,6.554,1.4647,3.5253,4.028,3.4901,3.0935,4.4673,1.0955,0.4954,0.0003,2.4247,3.797,3.2252,2.9584,1.6496,1.9364,2.5365,0.8061,4.7276,2.4624,0.0041,3.1076,1.2918,5.0899,2.9385,2.7229,2.7602,1.2811,5.797,4.7353,0.1592,3.7066,2.2871,4.9811,5.1107,2.8498,6.1038,5.3263,7.7374,1.3659,4.3723,2.0446,5.9323,4.3905,3.3202,3.0594,4.25,5.5306,2.6656,4.1471,7.4687,1.5755,3.1266,5.0809,3.039,5.0716,0.8981,3.4389,4.3064,0.6814,0.0002,3.8545,1.7547,4.074,0.7209,1.1003,2.6623,1.1785,2.5262,1.2797,0.0228,0.1655,0.994,1.2078,5.0868,4.2857,1.1614,2.1884,4.3073,4.423,0.1355,3.9267,1.3151,4.8465,5.7779,3.4172,0.5058,0.252,0.909,3.1275,5.1802,4.5658,1.01,2.0835,0.9422,0.01,2.3072,1.8732,1.5299,0.071,0.1718,0.1359,2.4436,3.1475,2.8116,6.0578,1.2147,3.6537,1.639,3.747,2.105,6.0327,5.2812,1.1961,0.2711,1.2952,6.2954,8.2595,1.0702,0.7263,0.5427,5.9883,0.8911,1.9398,2.2988,1.5667,1.7877,1.4346,0.3501,0.0901,0.0235,2.3807,0.485,0.0002,2.1992,2.4547,0.0006,2.0448,4.6118,1.9844,3.0958,3.4784,3.4926,0.1703,0.8228,3.043,4.1635,4.124,2.4603,4.9227,3.7362,0.0055,5.5504,1.5672,1.4729,0.1006,0.0015,2.6521,4.7758,1.0464,0.9232,0.3096,0.2206,0.1355,0.7483,0.753,0.0002,3.3088,4.5361,2.716,6.5179,0.6207,5.3841,2.1995,1.8606,2.1964,2.8362,0.3755,4.892,0.9485,3.616,2.9996,2.7069,3.0558,2.7936,1.6851,6.763,1.3517,1.4006,0.0172,0.1015,2.2206,1.5923,0.0006,0.7158,1.5684,1.3324,4.2626,3.8005,0.8903,1.0487,0.2494,0.0041,2.5088,3.5029,3.9704,1.1289,5.6572,4.1598,1.6272,3.7323,4.3333,0.5509,2.4673,2.6073,2.6732,7.7374,0.0639,2.4178,1.9364,0.464,4.7566,2.6228,0.4916,1.7495,3.0211,2.7603,2.4432,1.8181,0.9403,4.4392,2.6094,3.4642,0.1765,0.5445,0.3695,0.0002,8.1222,1.6666,0.2307,16.5673,7.275,1.1606,1.6408,5.4851,1.8795,3.5733,0.2537,1.4755,0.5312,5.1263,0.0439,1.3246,0.4133,1.62,2.785,3.863,3.119,4.0029,1.9801]}

{"id":3991,"ended":true,"length":579,"text":"One hundred million years after humanity left earth, they return to find a new civilization has taken their place.\nI don't think mankind was ever really created, after a long period of time, before the invention of the laser, we used a small amount of technology in time to create the world we live in today. But now people are taking over those countries and the economies of the world we live in. And we are now using those technologies, and people everywhere are using them.\nThis is one thing, but to use that technology in places where it is not currently present, how will it solve the problem of terrorism if it had never occurred?\nIt will improve the problems of terrorism.\nHow will this work?\nThe only people who are willing to live in that environment are the military and political leaders of their country. And then they will use the technology to create a new civilization.\nYes, the technology that is in use today has been developed by our allies, all over the world. But I would say that we have not achieved the full potential that we could have hoped for.\nI have to add, I also have to add, it is the human being who needs to be the focus. Our current predicament is the lack of human desire to help people.\nIn addition, we have a very large population that is at risk of being massacred because they do nothing more than listen and act as if they are part of the terrorists, and use those same people only to make their voices louder.\nYou can see the problem that exists both in the U.S. and around the world because the right to life in the United States and the right of each and every American to live a human life on their own accord has been completely eradicated, while so many U.S. citizens suffer from extreme suffering.\nI see what can be achieved. And I also believe that with the help of all of our allies, the United States of America will remain a nation that has remained a vibrant, well-rounded, well-protected nation as long as people do not resort to violence.\nSo as long as people live a human life, America will remain what it is today.\nWhat can we do to change it?\nWhat can we do?\nIn just a few short weeks it can be changed with each passing day at this level, and a change in the current condition of our nation will be brought about by our allies and our citizens.\nI suggest in a few short weeks you might start making some progress in your efforts by making your voices louder for good. And you might also start the right thing today to move that nation forward.\nWe have reached the point where if we continue our efforts today, it can be better than yesterday by now. What you might do is begin today by starting a petition around the world that will allow America's residents an opportunity to give their voices a place to put their voices into the issue of terrorism.\nThank you for your patience.","token_len":608,"entropy":[8.7809,4.5454,3.7109,3.4527,5.8894,3.9888,4.6731,0.2666,4.6735,7.1352,0.7141,4.133,2.4876,2.0818,3.9505,6.6635,3.8331,3.5257,0.207,0.6155,1.9068,8.0623,3.6788,0.0007,1.6314,7.0766,3.466,2.5735,3.3324,3.4044,2.4465,5.765,6.0096,2.5476,1.9303,0.0855,0.8659,0.9074,3.8109,1.5171,5.1424,0.0314,1.3162,6.9158,2.3022,5.4239,6.7433,3.5762,4.7188,1.2722,0.036,5.1139,3.127,5.7858,0.8293,1.1474,1.4186,3.1829,1.0995,1.7683,0.1269,0.4142,0.2969,3.1503,3.7858,5.7391,0.8729,4.5959,1.6884,5.9767,4.9821,1.1909,3.177,5.9084,1.0887,1.5841,0.6042,5.3444,0.2674,0.0146,0.9998,2.4683,2.4303,1.4024,4.0137,3.8003,3.6685,0.7036,3.4403,1.703,3.9332,5.4989,0.3122,1.1897,0.5236,1.1127,0.8824,3.7978,0.7688,3.982,4.2896,3.181,1.7666,5.3741,2.9692,3.2947,0.4058,2.2779,4.3353,1.5902,2.3544,1.409,1.2917,4.8941,7.7923,0.837,5.2451,4.3447,2.2146,5.5253,0.9212,0.8595,0.5596,4.1494,6.5611,1.6003,5.4327,3.2349,2.9406,0.4524,0.7865,3.1569,2.8601,6.2327,1.1323,7.14,0.6383,1.0209,1.2024,1.8582,4.3894,1.0165,2.5625,2.4788,0.6457,0.6674,2.3555,4.151,4.4409,0.5606,1.6674,3.3697,0.0269,6.0587,1.475,3.3712,3.1296,0.8607,0.9652,4.5457,1.3871,4.8398,1.4529,2.1484,3.6384,1.864,0.5254,2.1257,3.6235,1.7559,1.3856,3.0881,1.8473,1.2747,1.1217,2.6496,1.4377,1.6031,1.5926,0.7367,0.8564,5.7256,0.2624,2.7212,2.6644,2.6375,1.9388,3.5883,1.6536,1.3373,3.0691,2.0746,2.1271,1.6088,3.6418,4.7384,1.6361,6.3501,1.6561,0.0313,0.055,0.4857,1.8677,3.5873,2.9935,1.7302,0.7343,2.2286,1.6845,2.7817,4.6742,1.6586,4.2936,1.1983,2.1451,0.6825,3.8397,0.3872,3.1203,0.0915,0.7544,0.8189,2.7522,3.1606,2.8237,4.5645,1.6055,2.373,4.8836,1.9412,0.2369,0.8499,0.9181,3.93,0.7817,3.1342,5.2932,4.1733,1.0567,3.5845,0.9342,1.2765,2.2452,4.629,2.1658,5.2858,5.7072,5.5168,0.5653,2.6861,5.1496,0.0133,2.6383,4.917,1.8871,4.537,2.2743,1.1178,1.3238,3.815,4.3442,0.6264,1.7601,1.0638,2.1713,2.6588,2.9186,1.5582,1.8484,1.0101,5.2211,1.2633,0.7173,1.906,5.6905,0.0009,3.4515,1.7376,2.017,8.017,5.6056,0.1064,4.4506,3.034,3.4151,2.6341,0.5883,0.6047,0.8107,3.4977,0.0031,1.045,7.1405,2.6645,1.6331,6.4396,3.3968,3.2705,1.5971,6.4866,0.8604,3.0527,2.4786,5.6768,3.6941,0.8597,0.5681,4.2942,2.6531,1.6096,2.0673,3.2263,3.2238,3.7166,7.4414,0.7442,0.9567,3.4611,0.001,0.0377,0.1344,0.1407,3.228,0.0046,0.0312,4.0404,2.2793,6.4096,2.5729,1.7636,2.8448,1.1813,1.8293,0.0065,2.7524,1.5425,0.2879,4.2621,6.3268,3.2932,0.05,1.9536,0.458,1.6092,3.174,4.3067,0.0222,5.4455,1.4621,0.0744,3.9327,2.607,0.5117,3.7404,4.6004,0.0018,2.8233,4.8519,6.4562,0.3905,6.2353,0.0005,0.0025,0.0065,0.4109,4.5705,1.39,4.2277,4.365,1.8076,0.4056,2.6127,4.7407,3.6638,5.223,0.3509,3.0911,2.2744,3.0581,1.0498,3.1066,3.6702,0.2507,5.3898,1.2062,2.6317,0.0919,4.2339,1.1876,1.7794,1.5583,0.609,2.7311,1.7814,0.0207,2.7553,0.0019,1.058,6.3382,1.7331,4.2963,1.5769,2.8137,6.0682,1.9059,5.437,1.9013,5.2535,0.2212,3.7462,1.2249,3.5344,0.0461,4.9183,1.6714,4.5264,1.855,0.0075,4.2008,4.1555,0.1424,4.6145,0.0174,0.4105,1.2672,0.3315,2.8367,4.6587,0.9733,0.0028,1.5741,4.1381,3.3628,2.8037,0.0335,0.7678,5.5366,0.7382,0.9544,5.6391,0.1469,0.5407,1.1347,0.4008,0.6279,4.0864,2.8665,1.0261,0.4113,0.8081,3.5475,2.8317,0.1647,0.1852,4.1212,0.9477,0.181,0.1484,3.7406,0.483,3.8268,6.2952,0.8902,0.3572,0.4384,2.8012,5.6726,3.9545,0.5705,4.8806,5.5051,6.3029,1.1121,0.3151,7.3837,3.0856,3.822,1.9289,1.3893,5.3821,4.0144,1.7047,1.1342,4.6568,7.2002,0.7062,1.8079,2.9949,1.592,1.5519,3.8473,0.1587,2.1927,2.3883,2.0437,1.4748,1.9007,4.5585,0.3467,0.4606,2.2238,6.4466,5.1855,3.224,1.0545,1.1105,0.2199,4.1319,4.4306,3.6147,4.6773,2.8365,3.3266,1.9451,3.1657,1.7492,5.175,3.1772,2.2735,3.2092,3.1325,4.9623,5.7175,0.5207,2.7779,2.3781,0.7909,2.7985,1.5772,5.2888,4.2976,3.3563,5.6343,2.746,4.8404,4.5075,4.5992,0.6766,0.5882,0.4056,3.2936,1.9801,4.374,1.3648,0.8384,0.409,4.2742,0.8309,3.3124,3.6664,1.5338,2.9907,0.5015,2.845,2.7917,0.7329,5.564,1.7398,4.3696,6.0903,5.5,0.2514,5.7121,3.3703,3.7941,2.4777,1.1125,4.4182,5.9142,1.4405,4.0911,2.3473,3.4427,6.5525,0.5961,0.4696,2.4121,1.9464,4.6648,5.0286,2.7337,6.3639,6.057,0.503,0.0818,5.135,1.5663,0.9806,3.2563,6.0059,1.3853,4.5874,0.8492,2.5337,3.8485,2.4697,6.66,0.7419,1.1767,0.4644,0.4163,3.9963,0.0194,1.885,0.971,4.5603,0.8321]}
{"id":349,"ended":true,"length":570,"text":"You're a Vegan who just got turned by a 1,000 year old Vampire...' - A book written by an expert on veganism who has a doctorate in Vegan, the book offers insight, knowledge and practical advice about veganism, nutrition, family, animal rights and health issues. It's now available in print for those of you who are interested in reading it.\n\nWednesday, February 04, 2017\n\nI just bought the new Kindle. It came with a little package labeled \"Free Book of Veganism\" and it's now free to download as a PDF! Click here to download it!\n\nI ordered mine recently as the freebie because the Kindle is free as well to read to your Kindle. I thought you might enjoy reading a nice ebook to you while we are here.\n\nHere's the picture of the new Kindle version of \"Free Book of Veganism\" that I will be posting later. It's really pretty, all of color, and all I want you to do is grab it with your hands.\n\nI know that some of you have already read and maybe that you already know you want to read a vegan book without ever knowing how much information you need. And, I think that you will as well.\n\nAnd, this is a very small sample of the PDF files I am sending you to get access to those. To get full access to them go to this link link:\n\nWhat I think you need to know about this Kindle - the freebie version. I really hope that you are looking into a new or a vegan or vegetarian choice as these are the books that I recommend to you. There are many vegan, vegetarian, nutritionally-oriented books that you can find online too so be sure to check those out before purchasing any. If you think that others can help you learn more about veganism, you can contact me at my eBook@cvegan.org.\n\nI won't be posting photos of all of my books just yet so be sure to check out my blog in the next few days to learn more about Veganism, its causes, history, politics, and the history of the word vegan!\n\nI've actually gotten a lot of questions about the freebie version of \"Free Book of Veganism\" because they were so far from my original plan that I forgot to read them before purchasing the new Kindle. Sorry, but this is why I can't just say \"Hi, I don't know how you like this book!\" The book has a lot of good info and I love it! However, I am definitely not reading it for the easy stuff. The book will be great for the everyday stuff, but it can be better if you read it for the easy stuff. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know about the freebies!

{"id":2792,"ended":true,"length":569,"text":"The U.S. breaks into a modern day civil war. Tell the story from a unique perspective.\n\nThe Trump administration is clearly breaking into an old form of a civil war. The story begins with an initial attack, against Israel, where the Americans had just defeated the British. After the U.S. retreat, the American diplomatic corps fled west and the Israeli government started supporting America's defense. American leaders are working through what they see as a desperate need for support.\n\nThe Americans are now playing the role of war-makers, and one of the early leaders of the day, President Trump, had said before the war started that the United States had to defeat Israel because everything else in the world was against America. The people of Israel are now in his words:\n\nYou should not have to be the one to say to the American people that we must come to terms with your history.\n\nIf we can do that, we will be there right away.\n\nIn the months following the battle, Trump was asked whether he would support a plan to allow Israelis and Palestinians to take over the West Bank. Trump replied, \"We're considering the possibility, as I'm not sure exactly when you'll decide. I'd think it would be within the next five years. I certainly would not suggest we would do it at this point.\"\n\nIn fact, after the fighting began and the U.S. was still in negotiations with Israel's governing Palestinians, many of the Americans in the room said the plan needed to include settlements. It could include both settlements between the Arab and the Israeli government. The Israeli government would not confirm that it would actually do that. The American leadership, however, was adamant that such a move should be in the offing so that it wouldn't damage the status quo. If Israel would choose to negotiate, then the U.S. would be given the right to negotiate with the Palestinians for the first time in history. No matter how hard things are, neither the U.S. nor the Palestinian leadership would support something that was no longer the \"good one.\"\n\nFor the Americans, though, this latest setback to what would be a long, difficult process, would be the beginning of more wars and conflict as we know it. If the U.S. were to engage with Palestinian protesters at the start, and a Palestinian protest leader was killed, it would likely raise the pressure on Israel. And any escalation that escalates it in a way that puts further pressure on Israel or its government would likely be met with a harsh response from the Palestinians and President Trump.\n\nIt is also ironic that after all the talk of the Palestinians being the \"good Israeli\" in the middle of it all, Trump is responding by announcing plans to withdraw from the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in favor of more attacks that will directly harm the peace process. Trump's proposal will be seen as an admission that the U.S. did not have an obligation to end the war.","token_len":610,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,11.9541,4.4722,3.014,8.6535,2.9467,4.9261,0.0492,2.4913,9.9332,2.7874,1.5504,4.617,2.6242,5.7656,0.5418,1.349,1.118,0.0063,2.6981,6.4738,0.8649,1.5017,5.2456,5.5613,2.326,2.8891,2.4964,5.7678,0.0927,5.4802,1.3013,0.0088,0.8442,2.067,4.9287,2.6637,1.022,3.1697,4.5224,4.2604,4.0639,5.8162,5.5345,0.9863,5.5437,1.5776,5.2104,4.3575,4.4239,4.4608,1.38,4.3435,1.3717,3.7078,1.7763,2.9722,0.0012,0.0356,0.0538,5.6051,1.1581,0.9431,3.8861,7.134,0.759,6.8698,6.3579,2.6344,2.0454,3.5805,1.8428,4.4756,5.9724,6.1938,1.1019,5.464,1.33,4.9766,3.8355,4.5365,5.6932,5.1464,4.5887,1.5273,3.0295,0.0703,1.1642,4.9194,3.344,1.2911,4.4546,1.6906,1.3909,0.0003,1.5102,3.9609,2.0504,3.2005,6.1522,2.2335,1.4599,0.0461,5.2092,2.6615,2.6079,1.4693,2.8228,5.5543,0.6545,0.7208,5.9166,3.5665,1.0378,0.6204,8.1668,1.3747,4.35,2.2548,0.2907,3.9499,3.9528,5.0498,0.9014,1.6102,1.7174,0.7764,1.5258,1.7108,0.0051,2.8605,2.0532,4.9374,1.4381,2.8931,8.3025,4.2418,2.2931,0.2457,0.5431,0.5403,3.8702,4.4744,0.2913,2.063,5.5337,0.9015,0.7467,1.835,3.0195,3.5079,5.5838,6.5252,1.8007,2.6365,0.0002,4.3739,4.8545,2.3991,2.7356,0.9807,2.6687,3.4107,3.6705,0.8311,3.4011,3.4253,1.6204,2.0284,0.0713,1.1813,1.8257,2.8672,5.0382,0.9983,1.7057,0.0941,4.2481,5.8878,1.0519,2.9366,0.0003,4.6387,2.6985,3.2948,3.1008,0.9237,0.3167,1.5881,1.5743,1.9847,5.5952,6.8548,1.1363,0.4382,0.7156,0.0002,3.6198,1.4249,4.4836,2.2832,0.271,5.88,0.7539,2.7953,2.8069,3.3438,3.2039,0.5752,1.1884,2.665,1.7073,5.6648,0.4681,5.0475,3.9561,3.3643,0.2357,0.2378,5.0399,0.6117,0.8901,1.4649,0.0007,1.0403,2.5544,2.2484,1.4254,0.1076,2.4528,2.1226,7.2315,4.3319,1.3011,2.3311,4.2594,2.0394,3.2039,4.2694,1.4443,4.9244,3.5469,5.1373,2.296,3.8825,3.1546,1.3548,3.5481,5.2235,1.4836,0.7205,0.3111,4.3124,0.9889,0.1612,3.5472,1.5239,1.8852,1.4627,5.0466,1.2546,1.5398,5.6383,3.152,3.9083,1.8067,1.2195,3.4705,1.5097,0.6599,0.9098,0.4343,0.0003,2.9925,3.1575,0.0298,3.7566,0.6923,5.3624,1.6648,3.5211,1.0177,2.1102,0.0005,0.0026,0.0416,2.9448,5.2551,2.0868,7.0201,0.7452,0.5321,5.5505,7.7104,7.8151,0.3731,4.7105,1.8698,0.6733,3.8337,3.281,0.7459,3.2883,2.8738,3.4393,3.573,5.5048,0.3663,3.9644,5.8932,1.3091,4.1512,4.1298,3.0423,5.1052,3.6202,9.0676,0.828,6.8919,1.0168,4.0423,2.6479,5.3549,0.7714,2.4494,4.2426,0.5561,2.1814,2.537,5.9209,2.164,1.8161,1.2809,5.0079,2.0337,1.6378,0.6791,2.7834,2.7299,3.5971,2.6339,1.48,0.0104,2.265,3.3606,0.4654,4.1054,0.4451,1.2278,3.2373,0.9556,4.3458,0.5702,2.5359,0.0043,5.7044,0.9372,1.6374,3.291,0.0004,5.0971,0.8993,3.9707,0.138,0.5246,5.6402,3.5922,2.8385,4.8448,0.2504,5.1588,0.8793,2.8175,1.1989,1.9134,0.0004,0.0017,0.0267,0.732,1.8956,6.452,1.1081,2.4872,0.0359,2.9032,1.1648,1.4675,0.4695,4.2402,2.173,3.3436,0.0019,1.1369,2.3968,0.237,6.2587,2.6157,1.3566,2.1634,5.1253,3.0045,1.1127,6.1656,1.8079,1.7192,0.0004,0.0025,0.0312,0.2321,1.1078,3.2178,0.8061,1.4375,5.8256,6.098,0.8183,2.628,5.9573,0.161,3.3653,5.3173,3.9985,5.909,0.5904,0.3833,0.0002,4.826,1.5551,2.5368,0.3113,5.1881,0.0191,2.3921,6.2634,4.5547,4.8564,4.9458,3.3435,1.6115,0.8409,2.076,2.419,3.1125,2.574,3.7314,3.3537,1.1451,1.9727,1.6485,0.0496,5.299,5.4761,2.1277,5.3381,5.1505,1.8514,0.572,0.1434,0.1529,4.0491,1.3504,1.5536,0.0005,0.0022,0.0227,2.8729,0.2349,5.1422,5.2869,5.1706,6.879,3.9686,0.888,3.4338,3.7538,3.1108,5.2814,2.5691,4.0955,3.2919,1.9573,1.6199,0.7102,2.4476,0.2593,4.3073,5.4018,1.4886,5.5716,0.6541,1.2796,2.2673,3.578,5.8746,4.5602,3.373,6.8496,0.0048,5.5809,5.0962,2.3322,0.9123,0.0574,3.6921,6.0832,0.3104,0.0249,1.0684,4.7015,4.3259,2.5834,0.72,2.5552,2.0267,1.5677,0.0671,1.8264,5.4605,0.4632,0.759,0.5906,2.0952,2.7935,6.5198,0.2165,0.4325,0.3518,0.0002,3.4333,1.0768,3.1012,6.6463,0.2805,4.178,2.8506,1.5843,3.9548,1.0843,2.4536,4.0365,1.7515,3.0261,2.1545,1.0885,8.9508,1.0923,2.7093,0.8038,6.5972,0.3341,4.4971,0.0945,0.1213,2.4605,2.8774,7.1183,2.4105,4.5631,3.9144,0.295,4.1847,0.944,0.2961,4.8065,0.0507,0.3041,0.696,0.267,3.4257,3.0811,0.0014,3.5739,4.4379,4.4833,2.1781,6.1005,2.7688,0.9856,1.5102,0.0391,0.4886,3.6171,1.5698,5.1681,4.1228,2.186,3.1003,0.4166,1.9534,5.0904,0.7388,1.4521,1.9245,0.0008,0.0033,0.0365,5.5497,0.2055,2.1145,3.3638,3.4666,0.0659,4.1123,0.4655,2.3517,1.8961]}
{"id":3170,"ended":true,"length":568,"text":"People are born with superpowers that correlate with the circumstances of their birth. Then there's you. A young girl born in a donut shop in the 60s who had to sleep through an accident in a hot summer day. An older girl born in the 60s who had a kidney problem who had to sleep out of the hospital in an ice cave. But now people do wonder if those people were born born with superpowers. So the question has to be \"What if they did\"?\nSome are born with superpowers that correlate with the circumstances of their birth.\nSometimes, there is one \"life-long mystery\" - who is born with the superpowers? People who were born too young to imagine them as children.\nHow often do people wonder if those superpowers really do exist today?\nOne of the most recent known questions we face is whether a human being born in the past or in the present is born with an extremely powerful personality and that is in question or has it actually become natural?\nWhat is the \"prove it\" that an unknown person has achieved with something that is so powerful, or that has only happened for a few seconds, but that is not really proof of the human being being born with superpowers; rather it is proof of the fact that he\/she was born with more than his predecessor.\nIn the study of how people have obtained superpowers through evolution, you can find that out on a number of other occasions:\nThe study of how people use special tools for acquiring superpowers.\nIt can also be found online that there are studies that show the potential of children who have acquired the superpowers from their mother to have a successful life.\nThe study of how people take into account the possibility of having children with superpowers and then also the possibility of having children with superpowers.\nThe study of how people obtain the superpowers of children.\nIt can also be found online that there are studies that show the potential of children who have acquired superpowers from their mother to have a successful life.\nAnd in the modern day, we even know that people born in the past have the abilities to become special beings.\nThere are theories that it might actually be the case that some kids born in the past have superpowers and that they are born with the abilities to become super powers. This theory is already being studied on a couple of occasions, and a similar hypothesis was recently published on the journal Evolutionary Psychology.\nIn the study of how people acquired those superpowers by using special tools for acquiring the powers, you can uncover the evidence of how superpowers may or may not work. In the case of children born born in the past, the researchers confirmed that individuals with the powers were indeed born with superpowers. This can be illustrated by the fact that individuals born in the past had the abilities to become superpowers as well.\nThis is what the study of how superpowers can be used in relation to genetic information and also when people have superpowers.","token_len":611,"entropy":[3.9961,7.3215,1.4081,6.8845,0.7716,2.8088,10.1254,0.5601,2.7807,7.5217,1.2337,0.3561,1.3216,0.927,6.5603,2.5212,0.9823,7.0301,1.452,4.5766,4.4786,2.455,3.987,2.2668,1.9969,11.356,0.0783,1.0589,2.2341,2.5217,6.555,0.3175,2.6014,3.8492,2.5653,6.4633,2.9708,3.5941,5.354,3.5795,2.4028,6.312,2.4116,2.1757,1.4696,4.4672,1.9288,0.9907,1.5408,0.5845,1.7507,3.2277,0.008,0.2454,1.6192,3.982,6.9701,3.2643,3.0533,1.5565,0.2929,4.0657,5.2692,2.3441,2.5878,2.8193,3.4943,2.7576,3.7781,3.9695,0.907,4.7373,4.1776,5.873,5.7026,6.7354,2.0954,3.3282,3.4381,2.3516,1.6607,6.2707,0.4767,0.868,0.1191,0.8086,3.8623,3.2017,0.9172,4.4793,0.7647,0.2904,4.4539,1.8223,3.1971,2.2594,4.4599,5.7575,2.0158,12.7586,4.816,2.2218,0.1685,0.7685,0.1006,1.8574,0.8452,0.0577,0.609,0.1945,0.01,0.0421,0.0182,0.1749,2.6861,5.9533,2.0128,3.1395,2.062,4.3759,5.4604,6.4443,1.7008,5.31,6.4142,0.7879,5.7947,4.8395,1.3879,2.6102,0.098,2.3089,1.4331,0.1886,1.1382,4.942,1.8575,3.0746,0.1408,7.9969,0.3975,1.3873,5.7622,5.2397,4.5672,4.8268,1.1372,1.7109,4.2303,3.9537,0.4957,1.9331,2.2432,1.3906,4.5511,1.5113,0.1591,4.6477,2.7194,0.3457,7.265,0.1555,0.7023,4.2323,1.4632,0.1903,1.4146,4.2717,6.0611,4.6091,5.0544,3.2957,0.348,1.9586,3.9018,3.4865,0.8759,2.3758,1.4979,1.0015,3.8458,3.4228,2.5482,0.1925,1.5636,1.5912,1.8424,0.1205,3.9177,4.5456,1.8014,5.4125,3.7209,3.315,1.9725,5.638,2.8792,7.7328,4.2186,2.0995,5.102,4.051,7.6958,1.4326,0.5146,3.3139,1.6631,0.7254,3.6003,5.2785,4.8865,1.514,0.759,2.3859,4.0943,5.7787,1.1333,1.9047,5.6924,5.4082,5.3713,1.7257,1.2825,2.7354,1.7344,3.0213,3.3203,1.6116,2.8782,4.985,3.8077,4.089,0.8246,1.4701,2.9663,1.7139,3.1856,1.273,1.502,1.9277,3.5229,4.3174,1.5234,2.4536,5.7294,0.5006,1.9986,4.1892,0.6627,1.1773,0.0982,7.1499,3.4532,1.4883,0.3141,1.3142,0.5632,0.9419,3.3033,0.0597,3.1185,2.3894,0.0014,2.8562,0.1683,0.2976,6.0242,1.6085,5.0161,11.8888,1.1595,0.6073,3.2188,1.7343,5.967,0.7443,4.6873,2.3106,3.0408,6.074,1.2863,0.0716,4.5344,4.476,0.3853,5.0391,2.4207,1.9604,2.1765,7.051,4.413,1.3034,3.0549,0.0048,4.2908,1.7388,3.9096,0.632,2.6366,5.5677,0.1406,1.5385,1.188,5.3457,5.102,3.31,3.5591,6.4865,0.8428,0.0529,2.8276,0.9046,5.8712,3.2179,2.2956,0.1554,1.0065,6.9105,1.649,3.471,0.7592,4.777,1.1911,0.8973,3.4661,5.5084,1.5502,5.8861,2.8034,1.4122,4.2208,3.1949,3.0347,0.0459,3.5389,1.5645,2.8848,2.2544,2.2369,2.25,6.2668,2.2526,0.6956,0.5704,1.9305,1.3542,0.1708,0.5906,1.1446,5.2563,5.452,0.2109,1.3204,3.9202,0.5152,3.1868,2.5886,2.1938,2.0095,0.0513,2.7958,4.3644,5.9924,1.6539,1.6656,0.3719,1.103,0.9053,0.7726,2.5012,0.0716,2.0304,0.233,1.2524,0.4292,0.064,0.326,0.6053,5.5348,2.4127,1.8149,0.0411,2.4417,3.7077,1.6469,0.2624,3.1916,0.47,0.2761,0.0517,0.0385,0.4775,0.0733,0.7599,0.1778,0.2948,0.1064,0.0472,0.4698,0.1867,0.0321,0.3294,0.2506,0.0793,0.4168,3.1782,0.001,0.1545,0.0012,0.0259,0.0049,0.0105,0.0094,0.0068,0.0083,0.0471,0.5025,3.6187,3.6272,1.51,6.3815,2.2374,0.7004,2.9503,6.2568,3.1562,0.5495,2.4768,3.3172,1.0959,0.2394,1.5583,1.7041,2.9828,3.687,0.5656,2.9329,6.5727,3.1813,1.3298,0.903,3.5671,0.6707,5.6454,0.9934,4.8843,2.9651,3.9369,0.3003,2.8601,0.2471,0.1274,2.7574,6.0506,1.3982,0.5999,0.1054,0.4813,1.1355,1.5199,0.0816,2.4208,1.8286,1.9752,1.453,1.2642,0.2682,2.4766,1.6212,0.6433,0.725,1.8753,3.6062,0.6117,3.7727,3.6401,0.8979,6.6793,1.6649,3.3745,3.9589,0.8353,6.4371,0.0764,0.2575,1.7542,2.2184,4.3531,5.0099,4.3642,2.0685,1.7616,3.9424,2.7017,1.1433,7.6829,3.2517,1.3975,0.5499,0.473,0.4498,2.9845,1.2905,2.0922,0.0708,0.2728,0.4786,5.3779,6.1507,1.3696,0.0492,4.2876,4.0337,0.8044,0.1609,1.5437,1.0027,2.8897,1.7623,0.6771,1.1506,0.0643,11.0085,2.1811,3.7519,2.4981,2.0873,3.4756,0.2369,3.8039,5.5142,0.0479,0.0011,4.12,1.4515,3.4832,1.1295,1.7962,0.0543,1.9942,0.598,7.3001,0.3227,0.0516,0.3048,0.3388,1.9167,3.4866,6.7159,0.6794,6.8242,1.835,1.5653,2.2798,2.6203,5.0407,0.7452,0.0795,1.4177,0.0634,0.9062,3.0561,4.5953,0.5214,5.8651,0.7174,1.5731,1.1044,0.0113,4.4423,1.0744,0.328,0.0798,0.4781,2.7748,1.6471,1.9967,0.1462,0.6815,0.6486,0.8503,3.7282,0.864,0.5577,0.6793,3.0088,1.5018,3.2361,2.3338,2.784,0.5637,0.6703,2.3525,0.0663,3.281,1.1813,4.192,1.7467,5.5826,0.0086,5.8875,4.6985,2.8045,5.1489,5.2202,2.6051,2.4244,2.2824,0.089,1.2434]}

{"id":409,"ended":true,"length":593,"text":"A father chains his werewolf daughter up in the basement on full moon nights. When someone hears the screams, child protective services investigate and find her there.\n\nThe book is a collection of stories. Each tale has a strong sense of closure, and each chapter has an end point meaning a complete ending. There are some pretty strong links between each story and \"A New Way To Die\". I did my due diligence on the story and came away with a pretty strong feeling, and it helped me see the need for more.\n\nIt is a good read because the author isn't afraid of breaking things up. There's only two bad parts about the book which I think should be avoided but the other good part is that it keeps everything interesting and interesting as well. If not, it really won't make you move on with your life unless you like the story.\n\nThere are a few scenes in the book which should be read or liked but that is okay because I will do my best to get that out of my system.\n\nA story I would recommend is A New Way To Die. It is a story I know and love because of the awesome ending and I love the characters. There is always the possibility that it would go off the rails. But this is a very, very scary movie and as long as you get past the bad elements it will keep going.\n\nI have not actually read any books that I know of but this one definitely gets me interested and hopefully I will get to read it when I finish reading the other novels. My favorite part is when the little girl begins to play the \"presents\" game. There is no need to hide behind a girl that is already acting! It is a very fun game.\n\nI also love the ending and find it exciting. I read so many books to read, and it takes me a while to get into the story. I do like the ending but the story is telling and is actually pretty interesting for the most part.\n\nWhen I finished the first book, I was excited to read the second one so I could get into the story of A Stranger Who Wasn't Found. The plot lines are similar enough where it is not impossible for the girls to figure out each other. The romance in that first book and the last book were just perfect. I guess I am just happy to read the third book at this level, and I look forward to a read of it next season.\n\nI am going to finish reading A Stranger Who Wasn't Found because I don't know how or why. I know that some people need to know or enjoy a story, but I think the first book definitely deserves that recognition. It is the kind of book where you get to figure out and appreciate the characters. It is a book where you can see how a lot of the plot takes place in a book. I don't suppose that the last movie or this one could be considered good because they could see the problems a book would be having.","token_len":612,"entropy":[9.6792,13.8324,0.7612,12.6794,0.032,3.7418,5.1405,2.3207,1.798,4.4843,5.4436,9.1701,5.8867,4.91,1.3152,3.8857,6.5748,4.9761,1.7637,2.5697,1.195,10.4704,8.1443,0.535,4.6079,1.6082,3.0604,2.9299,5.9445,0.6668,1.8887,0.0028,2.4967,6.6155,1.8324,1.99,3.7793,0.0182,1.4769,4.5542,2.9573,3.4076,2.7538,1.3639,5.2096,3.3943,0.0111,4.8473,1.5097,1.5809,2.037,3.0832,2.467,2.5911,4.3883,2.4944,10.3186,4.3637,6.1109,2.5189,0.4787,3.7606,0.7525,3.3961,5.3436,3.5522,6.2587,1.8634,3.0552,0.7848,1.4926,6.6231,4.2948,4.6013,4.6015,3.5615,2.5202,1.516,3.2692,5.2103,4.0851,4.6184,0.0076,1.7849,1.5797,2.8671,1.3508,3.6997,2.1988,0.3865,1.2484,3.4935,1.244,2.6768,4.3667,2.0255,2.6151,5.5077,0.8195,4.8986,1.6464,5.555,0.4951,1.6274,3.2401,0.7731,0.0003,4.0462,1.659,1.7296,3.168,1.5953,4.1255,2.4769,2.9924,6.0121,0.0009,1.3224,2.4796,4.4212,3.7617,2.0462,0.8441,3.0449,2.522,5.0304,3.2644,4.7291,3.0751,3.0605,1.4156,0.5612,4.8444,1.506,2.8345,3.7182,0.3741,2.9635,4.9222,3.5118,3.1091,5.4385,1.5142,0.4649,1.0191,1.4524,4.9985,4.8679,2.4679,1.3921,1.977,3.9294,2.4684,0.3161,3.8369,5.936,1.1358,1.8225,5.6749,3.5827,0.0036,3.4129,1.3864,7.1692,1.0612,4.8421,0.4354,0.1369,6.1248,0.2119,4.4822,2.2042,1.734,0.7173,0.7071,0.0002,4.3436,0.6105,1.8671,0.9113,5.3244,1.9099,0.3833,0.2731,1.4848,4.3229,0.7856,2.756,4.9909,6.5844,3.0853,4.3646,1.9203,5.5797,1.1676,2.0888,4.1832,4.1117,0.4685,0.1325,0.3122,3.904,4.4023,2.2256,1.2328,2.3368,2.3401,0.5811,1.4134,0.0002,3.6667,4.7372,3.9367,3.3286,1.1693,3.2021,4.2779,1.7163,0.1767,0.0841,0.0018,1.4014,1.2976,0.8686,1.1368,2.521,3.2386,4.4342,3.3759,1.0332,4.313,1.3944,0.8211,6.7456,5.0298,1.8104,3.0315,2.7129,1.6182,2.8578,1.0693,3.2314,1.4677,4.6169,3.8227,2.2105,0.8789,3.1437,3.8797,4.575,3.5126,0.7014,0.115,3.2484,2.589,3.3818,1.1262,1.4064,3.4405,4.7816,0.0127,5.9701,4.6882,1.3873,5.0474,2.4575,0.0037,1.1096,3.8081,4.5193,0.9605,4.1551,4.9081,2.96,1.2891,2.8635,3.7781,0.4849,0.619,0.0002,2.0884,2.7234,3.3172,5.5126,0.8606,2.9968,3.4749,2.2259,2.1172,3.0535,0.4282,2.4859,2.0775,1.2066,4.0011,4.4496,1.1685,3.9298,2.5358,5.0227,1.8822,0.6451,2.8738,1.6327,0.8588,1.9456,5.0213,0.43,3.7692,2.8003,2.9362,2.3536,4.9269,0.6674,5.7937,3.1109,2.1217,1.4034,1.6165,1.7211,6.0236,0.8141,5.4179,0.365,4.6939,3.4681,4.6133,5.5193,7.1919,0.5325,3.3829,1.4799,3.9642,0.8193,1.9832,4.2009,0.3795,5.0761,2.9664,1.9194,5.8135,4.0544,1.2787,4.4418,5.8524,7.0917,2.4611,0.9056,1.6178,1.9299,2.7265,1.4741,2.2416,0.7045,0.0002,1.9749,3.4609,1.9901,1.0051,2.518,2.7485,7.0013,0.9008,5.2682,0.7914,1.7713,4.3654,4.0234,0.1533,1.4777,3.9629,3.7998,2.6645,1.3426,3.0497,5.2182,0.9572,2.1306,0.9462,0.0415,1.4048,3.1135,1.6712,2.6724,0.7365,1.5288,3.6641,2.2555,1.0289,1.2654,2.7529,3.3102,2.4736,1.0661,5.7375,1.9424,4.1663,5.4105,3.3467,2.5196,4.0957,2.3099,2.9354,0.0032,0.1504,1.0636,0.0001,5.5784,0.7693,3.1501,2.0983,2.2641,0.8138,1.4516,0.2697,1.616,3.583,1.0517,0.8837,1.9041,1.2701,1.0312,3.9406,0.3355,4.6077,2.439,1.8717,0.8279,1.2326,4.2718,2.3356,7.5634,6.0996,3.6508,1.5285,0.0014,8.475,0.4772,2.3251,5.1197,6.666,1.03,5.2073,4.9878,5.8806,1.6181,1.5606,2.6276,3.7485,2.0419,1.8456,7.8141,0.1915,3.6978,0.4858,3.2605,0.0352,1.3564,1.7305,5.227,3.6819,4.3086,3.3429,0.3285,4.9403,0.8224,6.9182,1.8435,2.474,3.7449,4.6345,0.721,1.687,5.3328,1.3948,2.1562,2.5727,4.8267,1.9556,2.8598,2.1149,3.388,1.0184,5.341,1.402,6.6455,3.0958,2.5892,1.4266,5.2376,0.001,0.0066,4.9752,6.1013,1.4385,3.276,3.8877,4.6999,0.2832,0.4481,0.0002,1.7389,2.3459,3.1391,0.0364,4.5794,3.0005,1.3502,0.3593,0.1658,0.0252,0.0845,0.0002,0.0175,2.6449,0.7554,3.6467,0.0009,1.7577,1.5684,5.9286,0.8033,1.6093,0.8914,2.985,1.4487,3.84,0.9797,6.5241,0.4975,3.5051,4.7046,5.5861,2.6997,1.6774,2.0967,0.8087,0.7909,2.7761,2.8687,3.7348,0.8437,5.6518,2.4821,3.1209,4.2166,0.3896,2.1137,0.7593,3.36,2.8288,0.0242,1.6029,2.3522,0.8578,3.0788,0.4003,5.9601,0.1745,5.0761,3.6016,1.1806,1.0409,1.9398,1.9367,0.6754,1.5448,3.5129,1.4315,0.5193,1.7709,2.8907,2.4831,3.3831,2.9549,0.0379,2.0681,4.3769,4.472,0.1,1.9826,1.5662,4.6758,1.1487,1.9568,3.3129,0.0017,7.9893,1.5403,3.6617,4.6099,7.2625,2.878,5.1388,1.1439,3.2241,1.6425,2.3229,3.5453,3.1967,2.443,3.8969,6.9997,1.7195,5.5035,4.9693,4.7956,4.2811,3.3272,3.4585,1.0391]}
{"id":3691,"ended":false,"length":541,"text":"A strange virus spreads across the earth killing everyone but heavy smokers.\n\nThe virus known as Erectinib, first reported in 2002 by an anti-cancer researcher at the University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSCC), is believed to be linked to high smoking. But now scientists say the mysterious new virus spreads from the outside \u2013 with people's personal protective equipment being contaminated.\n\n\"What we see in the body is a very specific virus,\" said Dr. Alan Blalock, an infectious disease expert at UTHSCC. \"Like many other viruses, the Erectinib virus is the most sensitive to the cold and it spreads from one person to another very quickly.\"\n\nThe virus first enters the body through a pathogen \u2014 known as the coronavirus. \"We've known that for a long time now that people get an Erectinib virus and it spreads through the air, that there may have been more than one person that contracted this virus and we've been trying to identify any other infections that could have had more than one positive case,\" Blalock said. \"We're hopeful the human body could develop a novel method that could be used to determine the origin of this virus.\"\n\nAs more cases of the virus emerge, Blalock and his team believe they've developed a novel way to identify those infections. In fact, they want to know how many of those cases actually came from people who've been infected with Erectinib.\n\n\"They probably did come from both smokers who were infected and the ones who were not infected,\" Blalock said. \"We believe these are the first cases. Our objective is to find out how widespread and how quickly this new virus spreads.\"\n\nBlalock said a study will need to wait for others to have tested. However, Blalock is hopeful that the discovery of another coronavirus may yield novel treatments to help protect others.\n\n\"Even though we don't know exactly what this virus is, we can speculate that in the next few days it will become a problem,\" Blalock said.\n\nDr. David Smith, director of the University of Texas Health Science Center's Erectinib Research Lab, is an HIV and AIDS disease expert. He and other doctors have battled COVID-19, COVID-19, and COVID-19 patients throughout their lives. Smith is especially excited about a new drug for treating COVID-19. \"This is the first drug that is able to kill all or even some of these virus cells,\" he said.\n\nDr. Peter Dao, infectious disease expert at UTHSCC, said another team of scientists should be getting ready to test the drug against other viruses. \"There's a good chance that this one will be able to kill the virus,\" Dao said. \"I think we'd benefit from knowing that it could possibly be given to an additional patient who may be a new patient with COVID-19.\"","token_len":612,"entropy":[10.1302,9.2935,6.2255,4.762,0.9327,5.3309,9.0597,4.3091,4.101,12.2465,5.0509,0.8333,2.021,0.0028,2.1841,1.7333,7.089,0.023,4.7748,6.4854,5.4376,4.3403,3.9589,5.5921,2.4601,0.544,4.4026,2.8263,4.0707,5.1384,0.0199,4.5187,2.4399,1.9381,0.8369,0.6208,0.0102,3.3471,2.7014,0.043,0.0359,3.1207,1.7391,1.0236,5.0884,0.2598,1.402,3.1241,0.0322,0.7172,3.4569,0.0496,5.4319,5.2915,3.8679,3.7257,4.3401,2.6843,2.184,1.671,6.5487,4.7786,1.1584,6.0228,2.6704,2.4311,5.1946,7.1863,4.7441,3.8996,2.4656,5.8429,5.5566,1.3597,3.5946,3.8854,1.0689,0.1772,0.0003,1.73,3.8307,0.7844,3.6073,1.6931,1.3217,4.4939,0.5885,1.5989,2.6433,4.0665,3.545,2.0786,0.8938,1.7544,0.1765,5.7209,5.7913,6.0621,0.1206,0.2233,2.0741,1.1904,0.4297,2.0503,0.3008,4.1082,6.3179,6.0692,1.9073,0.6717,0.3412,6.2214,3.1013,1.632,0.8991,0.457,2.69,0.8814,0.0056,0.0077,0.002,0.3665,1.2396,4.413,2.0291,5.5076,1.7643,2.6491,5.6697,2.0788,4.3362,2.185,2.4213,2.5776,0.7792,0.275,0.3377,3.845,0.3297,0.9745,0.0619,0.0002,1.8436,1.3367,5.3407,6.3004,0.3451,0.6847,1.1157,1.7088,6.6043,0.1056,7.4156,3.2627,0.0278,2.2134,6.3268,0.0442,0.0418,1.5107,4.5253,2.7618,2.7069,2.4866,2.3324,3.784,1.0395,0.3137,0.0278,2.1653,0.7822,3.9203,3.5067,3.9002,2.8668,0.0036,0.0063,0.0018,0.9431,3.2848,1.9062,1.8388,2.6317,1.364,2.1003,1.9884,4.7848,4.4226,3.5258,3.6676,0.0456,4.9499,1.2145,0.1,1.2134,2.9068,3.9706,1.4893,0.2978,3.1231,2.8921,2.32,1.9387,2.5731,0.0578,3.3773,5.1652,1.4781,4.0401,1.0925,2.1288,0.2982,4.7591,3.83,0.3447,0.024,9.8661,2.1721,0.6871,1.0641,0.0004,0.002,0.2254,0.0639,1.7764,1.6497,2.2188,5.3497,4.1055,5.3309,1.2771,3.2674,3.5065,1.0137,6.8568,4.3355,2.974,1.3668,2.0986,0.5408,0.2473,4.3826,1.7517,4.4046,0.1533,0.9766,0.7496,0.6246,0.0333,0.0001,4.9008,5.3063,2.7713,0.8076,1.727,0.7899,2.4047,0.2389,0.9954,0.0011,0.002,2.279,0.372,1.3015,3.5018,2.4067,3.1644,4.2417,0.4442,3.0794,1.087,0.2477,2.2258,3.604,4.1251,0.8166,3.4674,3.1491,0.0214,1.373,4.4832,0.223,2.7632,1.9586,1.2726,2.7615,1.2699,1.7923,3.9564,3.0011,0.0885,2.0705,0.5685,4.1277,1.8493,1.728,0.6079,2.0123,0.0002,0.0019,0.0004,0.5497,0.5956,0.0002,1.3358,4.6332,6.1003,3.9976,4.4656,0.1636,5.7674,2.775,3.9645,1.5794,2.446,1.3159,3.6895,4.397,0.2218,1.4001,0.4791,4.7998,0.4382,0.2572,0.0006,0.0024,0.0614,0.0484,0.4331,1.7218,3.5956,3.9371,1.8663,0.8104,2.7179,1.1036,5.3101,4.4531,5.4934,0.2842,0.0802,2.2848,0.3692,1.4905,6.2586,3.2015,1.399,2.4482,1.867,3.002,0.7265,1.0874,1.2519,0.0397,0.0002,1.6933,0.0025,0.003,1.7475,4.3677,3.9857,4.1168,4.4885,0.095,4.6121,0.8616,6.8731,0.2029,4.3338,5.3903,3.5808,4.1496,0.0194,2.7134,0.0021,0.0032,2.5792,1.9911,0.8531,1.5564,4.346,1.157,5.1834,4.8362,0.0005,0.0141,3.2217,4.7136,5.8632,3.3469,2.6387,2.2038,4.186,5.2298,1.3632,0.2769,0.0002,0.7771,5.4001,1.2982,1.4912,1.515,0.0002,0.3749,3.0831,1.2058,2.3134,0.6591,0.3998,0.3643,0.8533,2.5847,5.4903,1.1765,6.3332,1.7279,2.5456,0.9864,3.5223,1.9021,1.8538,2.6702,1.67,4.4093,1.4761,0.5993,0.0008,0.0035,0.0299,0.0248,1.205,0.0002,4.0922,0.0042,3.6433,5.6774,0.3453,2.6425,0.0185,0.5101,3.4836,0.2872,0.5234,0.4953,0.0326,0.002,0.9297,4.5416,0.0026,0.0047,0.0018,3.0535,3.516,0.2261,2.1011,3.8533,6.4616,3.2308,0.943,5.0711,1.2217,1.6103,0.7105,3.9187,3.2819,5.6731,2.101,7.5916,13.7208,8.3993,4.1093,7.5471,1.569,5.6352,0.169,0.0699,2.3842,1.5872,0.6885,1.8379,0.0664,0.021,1.3243,6.6797,5.1194,0.7235,0.6717,0.3849,3.1888,2.0841,5.9901,3.017,0.3739,3.9269,0.7054,2.7663,3.2967,1.9614,0.9568,0.0077,0.1769,0.0166,1.1119,3.2346,2.2739,1.08,1.9006,0.462,1.5634,1.0344,2.6533,2.8616,0.0031,3.2789,3.51,5.211,3.3822,3.4666,0.4167,1.1927,3.8428,3.9509,1.0939,0.9058,0.0253,0.037,0.7691,0.0002,2.9671,0.0018,4.6985,4.2605,5.9803,0.2279,6.5066,0.2052,1.2183,0.3232,1.9205,0.2598,0.0136,0.01,0.1909,1.7699,6.8727,5.9107,1.0928,1.2327,6.2583,1.217,6.3998,1.006,0.5436,2.0575,1.0689,2.5818,4.7656,4.1395,1.2963,0.8979,1.1489,3.4093,1.2774,1.2235,3.8147,0.1963,0.6178,1.7764,3.3585,2.0128,1.0463,2.2606,0.0057,1.3744,2.5673,1.7921,2.4206,0.861,0.0003,0.0293,0.0399,0.8712,3.2071,1.1858,1.8082,4.2116,5.44,0.4383,3.4494,2.2131,2.6898,2.3192,4.6908,0.7551,6.6411,0.4835,4.1537,4.8467,1.4202,2.4638,3.28,1.7286,2.9885,3.8917,1.8325,2.6849,1.2959,0.0067,0.1717,0.0058,1.0522]}

{"id":1766,"ended":false,"length":564,"text":"After making a suicide pact, a boyfriend and girlfriend jump off the Golden Gate bridge, one of them dies. The other finds out that they are immortal.\n\nThe book is published by Harper Collins.\n\nThe suicide pact by Jennifer Aniston and David O. Russell, who is a Christian, was also on-screen, with their spouses Jennifer and David. But now people are wondering if those committed suicide because of the marriage? The story tells the story from the point of view of Paul and Sarah (Jennifer and David).\n\nThe book has received a positive and negative press from critics and audiences.\n\nSome said how difficult it was to read and had to stop when reading it.\n\nBut there are also certain words that have been made as famous to remember those who have committed suicide. Jennifer Aniston said:\n\n\u201cI can say with certain certainty that my husband and I have committed suicide, but I don't know whether that is true because we will always have our lives to live.\u201d\n\nOther critics said that it was difficult to read that day, with the movie giving its own twist or twist.\n\nThe first book and series that have become popular and adapted into the television series have been about two men (Paul and Sarah), who were dating for eight years and who left the world early.\n\nThe novel was originally written before it was adapted, although the story is based on a Christian story. In both novel and series they are about the marriage of Paul and Sarah (a Christian of the same faith).\n\nThe story was based on the real life life-stories of Paul and Sarah (who is said to be a widow). In the beginning Paul and Sarah were separated and Paul was in a serious relationship with David, a Christian preacher who was also married, while Sarah was in a relationship with John.\n\nThey were in the same home, and were living like each other.\n\nThe book was based on Paul\u2019s life story.\n\nWhen Paul gets pregnant with her, John asks his sister to do the same.\n\nWhen Paul\u2019s sister tells John she is pregnant, they go to see a doctor together.\n\nWhen Sarah's doctor is pregnant, they tell Paul he is pregnant and that it would be wrong to leave things for just six months without having it.\n\nBoth stories tell a story about David, a Christian of the same faith.\n\nBut John isn't ready to tell Paul he is pregnant and he won't reveal a person's religious background behind the name or religion.\n\nAfter the book was published for fans to enjoy, Paul said that the whole story had to be told after reading the novel.\n\nBut Paul was unhappy with the way it came out, saying

They have seen me succeed, because by working hard and feeling passionate and determined I became a better individual than I ever believed I could be. To this day, I continue to have the greatest respect for and appreciation for all of the work that I have done for the athletes of today.\n\nAs athletes, we often assume that we are just the result of a few years of hard work. I have no doubt in my mind that we have. If it were not for the work of so many teams in the past 20 years, I would probably claim that this sport has made me into the person I am today. With all due respect, those who have watched at home probably cannot tell you how much they appreciate the work the athletes doing. The athletes who have been competing for so long, however, would have no idea.\n\nI would love to see some of the athletes from the past have a look at this video. For a lot of people including myself, the Olympics have not only helped shape our athletic culture but also help give us the opportunity to see the best in each sport. Not only that, but they have shown me that when my wife is at home, we get to watch football, football or other sports which are still on television. It is an amazing thing. Now we can all remember the stories behind some of the finest athletes in our history and celebrate what we as a sport can do to make sure everyone has a happy holiday with each athlete we see and treat like a friend.\n\nAll the athletes in this video have done a great job of helping me understand that there is no easy way to win an Olympic Games. I hope that by studying the lessons of my childhood and how I can help you remember the Olympic Games, you will be inspired in how you play soccer, basketball, football, soccer... or any sports for that matter, just like you have a great sense of the Olympic Games.\n\nTo each of you, I truly believe that the Olympics mean the best in your life.","token_len":613,"entropy":[10.0639,1.5444,7.2561,2.4412,4.6389,11.5297,3.4346,9.1142,0.7901,3.4916,2.7246,1.4562,5.7789,6.0603,6.8656,1.3556,7.1674,1.5516,1.479,1.983,1.3596,5.7873,4.2772,6.6402,0.8886,2.0365,6.3965,0.7783,1.7754,6.0135,7.959,4.1385,0.0539,4.6605,2.9323,3.3601,0.263,1.8616,6.0243,0.0604,0.9258,3.2234,1.6958,10.8677,5.6554,2.5298,5.7643,0.5731,1.0056,0.0023,2.5831,2.9473,0.4416,1.9176,0.0648,0.0461,0.017,0.0037,0.0168,0.0011,0.0017,0.0001,0.0066,0.0012,0.005,0.0036,0.001,0.0029,0.0013,0.0022,0.0039,0.0014,0.0236,0.0017,0.0002,0.0003,0.0028,0.0021,0.0019,0.0005,0.0034,0.0094,0.0006,0.0002,0.0003,0.0141,0.0261,0.0005,0.0053,0.0072,0.0007,0.0029,0.003,0.006,0.0011,0.0001,0.0021,0.0002,0.001,3.353,0.0001,2.3342,2.8225,2.206,2.0295,5.5195,2.9039,0.0958,1.4432,0.011,1.0964,1.8044,5.5615,5.7337,2.0064,3.6138,3.5048,1.3522,1.0734,2.8278,5.1531,0.0867,2.1239,5.0903,2.1179,5.4393,3.6706,4.4232,1.2879,5.268,6.4531,4.0345,0.7074,0.9812,5.6085,5.7359,1.768,4.4757,2.1642,4.8018,1.2605,1.0977,4.409,2.9453,0.4881,1.8463,6.6777,0.3729,0.6776,0.3231,0.1318,5.0096,2.7878,0.0385,0.7465,0.4859,4.6844,0.0333,4.149,1.9713,3.1656,3.4438,0.2589,4.4091,2.2986,0.0464,2.5651,1.6825,1.1576,5.1686,0.8337,1.5431,1.7158,0.4515,2.8861,0.9558,4.1522,2.3854,3.8465,0.3245,0.7723,0.0001,2.1899,0.4015,0.1983,0.0171,0.0005,0.0004,0.0014,0.0004,0.0006,0.0022,0.005,0.0028,0.0496,0.0013,0.0028,0.0028,0.0022,0.0064,0.0016,0.0009,0.0004,0.0012,0.0311,0.0023,0.0027,0.0042,0.0271,0.0019,0.0027,0.0017,0.0049,0.0029,0.0008,0.0016,0.0014,0.0004,0.0011,0.0007,0.001,0.0023,0.0026,0.0016,0.002,0.0032,0.0015,0.0111,0.001,0.001,0.0009,0.0008,0.0258,0.0021,0.0093,0.0012,0.0004,0.0011,0.0013,0.0025,0.002,0.0029,0.0023,0.0005,0.0009,0.0017,0.0015,0.0045,0.0016,0.0021,0.0006,0.0171,0.0002,0.0052,0.0028,0.0006,0.0006,0.0002,0.0006,0.0054,0.0011,0.0771,0.0001,4.3588,4.8103,0.7315,0.6009,4.2225,4.9375,0.4408,1.4069,1.7513,4.0354,3.296,5.891,0.0804,2.3605,2.6347,3.1621,0.2667,1.7432,0.0213,1.3285,3.2461,2.6704,3.3912,1.3144,3.158,0.0263,0.1392,0.1286,2.7518,1.8421,5.1097,4.2554,3.7489,1.8579,1.5048,0.1768,0.9962,2.2705,1.9011,2.8781,0.0117,6.057,3.4298,1.0209,0.5899,1.5862,0.0102,0.2837,0.8349,0.7913,3.236,7.0199,1.3262,3.5342,3.0992,2.2972,5.4931,1.0827,5.2958,1.5791,3.1745,0.4242,0.0178,0.0529,0.1529,5.9144,2.6175,0.9605,0.0112,0.9905,5.1921,1.7524,1.6667,5.0177,6.6601,2.8496,6.9681,4.9718,3.263,1.0577,1.3657,1.3111,3.1622,2.5451,1.2642,1.0119,4.7268,1.4173,6.9329,1.7478,3.3702,1.8777,2.45,1.2437,2.4392,4.9302,2.0072,1.2773,0.3563,1.7756,4.5679,0.3684,4.763,2.5907,2.2512,1.0762,2.6041,0.7917,0.0001,2.0672,3.0472,3.2365,0.205,1.8957,3.8334,1.2511,1.1557,1.3976,4.1123,1.255,0.576,5.5615,1.3287,4.5134,0.391,2.7873,4.8404,1.5207,4.8241,3.3745,4.3846,0.1099,1.3629,9.1457,0.1512,0.1567,1.7329,2.3059,2.0113,4.1323,2.752,3.1819,5.0179,0.8646,6.2498,2.7266,1.7461,1.2138,5.1496,4.4547,0.5293,1.7439,2.0432,0.0602,3.5333,1.5242,2.7026,2.3174,1.6849,4.6741,0.6184,5.7752,0.5674,2.0717,0.1942,0.2385,2.579,0.5427,4.2379,3.8827,1.1771,4.7008,4.8696,5.8459,3.1417,3.9348,0.7037,0.7939,3.0481,4.4424,0.5032,2.3724,6.1278,1.2479,3.5011,5.6064,4.1171,0.5975,4.6498,2.0475,5.265,4.1446,3.4184,0.6865,2.6712,1.3529,2.8385,1.4445,3.3457,1.7915,6.0524,3.499,1.575,3.1607,6.5063,1.4152,5.8745,4.609,4.0558,0.1383,0.5343,5.1857,0.7799,1.5161,1.9687,2.6361,2.7553,5.1135,3.5676,1.7979,7.5835,1.3099,3.0801,2.3111,0.5565,1.4197,2.1658,2.535,4.1915,1.359,0.7979,4.6239,4.9624,4.6397,3.7632,4.4767,3.4108,1.3907,4.4619,7.0363,3.1793,2.2804,3.7445,0.2791,0.4056,0.0001,5.0844,2.5967,1.3238,2.1824,0.8543,0.1868,2.0925,3.0171,2.1186,1.1926,0.0287,1.5099,3.1556,2.726,3.1785,2.5225,2.9625,0.7628,1.9654,3.9995,0.5163,0.3316,1.6648,3.098,0.1236,2.0127,0.511,2.6761,3.1142,1.33,3.0932,6.419,1.4992,6.3306,1.8225,3.1219,5.7531,1.2502,4.0222,1.3958,2.5141,2.2781,5.0838,6.4568,1.4259,2.9913,0.1868,1.4669,0.7318,0.557,1.8225,3.7426,4.643,4.2166,1.0428,5.7693,5.2724,0.8591,1.4481,0.7635,2.4548,0.9124,2.7812,7.0715,3.9679,1.868,2.8499,4.6245,0.0399,0.0001,2.7001,5.0242,1.4656,2.0666,2.3319,4.3683,1.9891,5.6199,0.0427,4.0973,3.6036,1.2186,0.4438,0.6142,0.0002,4.2341,6.0694,1.4587,0.1626,1.1731,1.7618,5.3489,3.3499,0.3119,2.0149,1.5846,6.6338,3.0626,5.4429,4.1539,2.0,0.9632,0.5743]}
{"id":2381,"ended":true,"length":572,"text":"`` Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014 I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. '' Continue.\n\n'' Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. ''\n\nThere are two things, the first is that you don\u2019t see the whole road. It has the right length, width and width, without the possibility of a road going through the forest, in the same spot.\n\nThe problem with this idea is that, if you put a road through forest, you would only be able to cross through forest in the north part of the village, that is, the opposite of the forest, where everything goes on to the east.\n\nOn the one hand, there is no good reason to put the road through forest. Of course, the forest itself has more than enough trees in it for the road, and that is why most areas have wooded roads. But what if you go through forest, it would be clear to you that there is something in the forest that you know that you could see? So don\u2019t give the road up for a night, but have a few restures; maybe you just enjoy them, or maybe you enjoy your night in the night.\n\nBut, let me say. If it\u2019s the forest, then you can leave those out on the ground, right? That makes the road better, because this could be covered only with the earth, and maybe it would still look the way it does at night, even in the dark. On the other hand, if it\u2019s the wooded road, you didn\u2019t want to leave any more trees, you had already left too many.\n\nAlso, when you put the road under a tree, all the trees are cut down, because there\u2019s no place to cut down the trees.\n\nAnother problem is that it\u2019s a small area, where the tree might drop down to make room for the road, even if there are no trees. So it would be impossible to get the road to drop down, because it would be impossible to use the road.\n\nThird, it would be more efficient and less risky, since wooded roads do not have long distances. However, there would always be places where they can\u2019t drop down, and there doesn\u2019t always have time after that to use that road, since in a forest, there will always be trees where there\u2019s nothing left. With wooded road, you would only have to keep the roads cut down and that would be the case, since wooded roads can\u2019t be used anymore. This is how you avoid forest by building roads.\n\nSo, the idea is to have every road cut down the same way as the other. Of this idea, the road that ends up on the forest land is almost always cut down.","token_len":613,"entropy":[9.8274,8.6803,7.7292,0.4071,2.318,1.9351,6.931,4.4903,1.4914,3.435,8.269,5.3501,5.1434,1.8982,4.9089,7.6499,2.6516,2.4808,1.4617,6.7682,4.8049,6.5098,3.3272,3.5943,0.7812,2.0267,1.2733,8.3417,8.8177,3.4686,1.8141,0.0423,5.1637,4.2532,0.4729,0.0942,0.0005,0.024,0.0091,0.0104,0.0604,0.0915,0.0067,4.2079,0.0041,0.0021,0.0087,0.0045,0.003,0.0502,0.5105,0.0066,0.0076,0.0087,0.0031,0.001,0.0008,0.0441,0.6503,2.393,0.0002,4.5769,1.2677,1.8864,3.9963,4.479,3.0616,2.2817,1.2229,1.0589,3.659,2.9384,14.5908,7.8965,0.7103,3.8955,1.7473,4.7416,3.1845,1.9201,2.6636,3.7508,3.8575,4.037,4.3973,1.4168,6.3105,1.7019,2.3078,1.3212,5.6721,2.0399,5.2279,0.1531,2.3427,3.8233,4.0411,2.7358,2.4747,4.1334,1.8765,4.7456,1.6937,2.2791,5.1188,0.96,2.4944,0.0002,1.0454,5.1812,1.6048,1.1801,3.7018,0.3119,0.2177,3.0604,2.5069,0.7681,4.6022,1.4607,2.1184,1.1948,5.2212,0.5884,1.376,3.2725,3.3258,2.5316,1.1092,0.0071,3.4668,3.602,5.0423,3.4461,0.9333,7.5217,4.7208,0.2283,0.357,5.2589,1.0845,5.1026,0.5759,0.4974,1.8043,6.158,1.4482,0.4925,2.8001,2.3598,2.481,5.8459,3.4083,3.4742,4.6238,0.8048,2.7037,0.943,1.3554,0.0002,4.9415,0.206,4.6155,0.0228,0.1775,2.2811,0.7649,1.5836,5.3663,1.8744,0.9489,3.4635,2.3278,0.818,0.4358,1.2005,1.4188,6.8029,0.0606,0.337,2.4212,2.7932,4.036,2.9372,4.9586,2.2734,1.2317,2.2619,3.9515,0.4819,2.4032,2.1378,1.8924,2.1357,1.1671,2.8373,1.2256,1.4365,5.2049,6.8771,2.3953,5.4135,2.2912,0.791,0.8327,1.3984,4.2908,1.804,1.0878,3.7521,1.6903,2.1482,1.236,4.446,1.7054,0.9871,6.2286,1.9724,1.5337,0.5588,1.452,0.7908,3.5861,3.5979,0.8143,0.9727,0.9892,1.4924,6.6462,4.2548,0.9207,3.676,5.3243,3.1432,3.8453,6.3725,0.2729,0.1074,0.0184,4.6448,2.8511,0.3837,3.21,3.0236,2.6346,6.611,1.5672,3.3999,5.8216,1.2498,3.5394,6.1295,8.2793,5.3734,5.609,1.3702,5.9801,6.7212,5.3058,1.9177,2.1859,1.0724,0.3413,4.8683,3.5684,4.1145,2.9127,0.398,5.3198,0.6352,0.7157,0.0002,3.0475,2.4671,5.9523,0.8345,1.6455,6.1687,2.2184,3.8672,6.3343,0.1626,0.8384,2.8635,2.622,0.6035,1.4218,1.93,2.021,4.9442,6.1961,6.173,4.3175,0.217,4.0511,0.9785,4.884,0.2775,3.1325,4.2165,2.0812,0.982,3.6702,1.3951,1.934,5.869,5.1066,0.9037,6.7134,5.0462,1.5557,2.9176,5.7028,1.3409,1.3129,5.5766,2.323,1.7642,3.6123,4.4526,3.7594,3.1687,0.5808,0.9232,4.8828,0.1961,1.3741,3.6082,3.5371,0.4554,2.1505,0.3377,5.4902,0.0207,0.0237,0.0206,0.0255,0.544,1.2952,1.8017,0.0219,0.0049,0.3987,2.9585,2.8248,1.0015,0.1651,1.9098,7.3414,0.2011,0.4507,0.0412,2.0136,0.2596,2.1084,3.1938,3.7915,1.6382,2.1835,2.7637,3.7483,6.312,2.1656,5.1944,0.9415,1.4812,1.0103,0.0003,5.8434,0.1307,4.2576,0.6901,3.7429,1.4905,0.3497,5.4107,1.8616,1.1021,0.2776,4.7755,1.026,1.0896,2.2631,4.951,1.0382,0.9408,3.1774,2.4952,2.7384,0.1436,0.2972,1.4067,3.4368,1.1526,2.9824,2.0751,2.0728,0.5777,0.9928,1.8088,0.0004,5.2413,1.3542,0.8136,0.3295,3.014,2.5867,0.0192,0.009,2.6937,4.7331,2.8538,0.7352,3.488,1.6893,3.8819,4.6531,6.3443,2.0338,2.9694,3.83,1.107,0.2644,1.5087,1.1328,1.1658,4.6577,0.6922,2.5259,1.5131,1.1403,0.3908,1.3772,2.6019,2.9359,2.702,0.6773,3.6347,0.3515,3.2619,2.5252,0.7617,2.867,5.6028,0.3282,2.361,1.6747,2.0074,0.7568,1.0874,1.5252,0.2332,4.1748,0.7409,1.0069,2.0051,0.5312,0.0003,6.3892,1.0496,2.6115,2.2932,0.5427,3.8628,3.2739,4.4365,2.7778,3.7341,3.1362,2.4267,6.1466,1.0572,0.1639,3.4822,0.1099,1.7837,6.2192,2.7399,2.0374,4.548,0.0306,2.4926,2.9734,5.3149,0.0421,3.8929,0.679,3.8965,3.3596,7.6548,0.1651,0.0533,2.2758,0.2488,0.9894,1.4106,1.8267,7.3708,0.1042,0.07,0.007,3.0788,2.7788,4.9376,6.3821,2.8334,1.7191,3.0306,4.1924,1.3574,1.6735,2.9593,4.6828,3.5431,1.2233,1.2537,1.4374,3.7658,1.2328,0.0451,1.7917,4.4799,1.3454,3.405,0.0482,0.1941,3.6426,3.2081,1.0636,7.0573,2.8961,0.0665,3.4051,0.2261,1.7475,1.9966,3.2055,0.9902,0.4568,4.7878,2.322,3.7722,5.1326,0.176,2.8646,5.0312,1.3005,1.1912,2.3454,3.4706,1.8359,2.2944,3.7296,0.1671,0.2709,2.981,4.6714,0.0441,0.0034,0.777,0.7897,7.0873,0.496,4.7014,0.9724,4.2198,2.0155,5.1618,4.1437,5.4888,4.1868,2.0024,1.3214,0.2649,0.0003,2.9269,0.8726,2.8352,3.7939,1.4275,1.7666,2.8841,6.2129,1.4517,2.6716,0.0503,5.7896,1.0657,0.6079,2.6108,1.5983,2.0581,2.5924,5.2854,8.586,5.3925,0.4166,1.4179,4.2857,1.8794,5.0572,0.8396,1.7386,0.2439,3.6025,5.6453,1.0865,6.1886,0.7377,4.0931,0.0714,1.7657]}
{"id":2251,"ended":false,"length":564,"text":"After making a suicide pact, a boyfriend and girlfriend jump off the Golden Gate bridge, one of them dies. The other finds out that they are immortal.\n\nThe book is published by Harper Collins.\n\nThe suicide pact by Jennifer Aniston and David O. Russell, who is a Christian, was also on-screen, with their spouses Jennifer and David. But now people are wondering if those committed suicide because of the marriage? The story tells the story from the point of view of Paul and Sarah (Jennifer and David).\n\nThe book has received a positive and negative press from critics and audiences.\n\nSome said how difficult it was to read and had to stop when reading it.\n\nBut there are also certain words that have been made as famous to remember those who have committed suicide. Jennifer Aniston said:\n\n\u201cI can say with certain certainty that my husband and I have committed suicide, but I don't know whether that is true because we will always have our lives to live.\u201d\n\nOther critics said that it was difficult to read that day, with the movie giving its own twist or twist.\n\nThe first book and series that have become popular and adapted into the television series have been about two men (Paul and Sarah), who were dating for eight years and who left the world early.\n\nThe novel was originally written before it was adapted, although the story is based on a Christian story. In both novel and series they are about the marriage of Paul and Sarah (a Christian of the same faith).\n\nThe story was based on the real life life-stories of Paul and Sarah (who is said to be a widow). In the beginning Paul and Sarah were separated and Paul was in a serious relationship with David, a Christian preacher who was also married, while Sarah was in a relationship with John.\n\nThey were in the same home, and were living like each other.\n\nThe book was based on Paul\u2019s life story.\n\nWhen Paul gets pregnant with her, John asks his sister to do the same.\n\nWhen Paul\u2019s sister tells John she is pregnant, they go to see a doctor together.\n\nWhen Sarah's doctor is pregnant, they tell Paul he is pregnant and that it would be wrong to leave things for just six months without having it.\n\nBoth stories tell a story about David, a Christian of the same faith.\n\nBut John isn't ready to tell Paul he is pregnant and he won't reveal a person's religious background behind the name or religion.\n\nAfter the book was published for fans to enjoy, Paul said that the whole story had to be told after reading the novel.\n\nBut Paul was unhappy with the way it came out, saying

{"id":1741,"ended":true,"length":580,"text":"Across from you sits your ideal self. A door leads outside to the rest of your life. Only one may leave.\n\nThe most important thing to me is that you trust them so I can control what happens to you.\n\nI am going to use these words to describe myself\u2026 As if they are an actual thing. But let me introduce you to those people who are what makes me different. They are the people who are helping me stay in business and make it happen this way.\n\nIt\u2019s a word and I\u2019m afraid it can be misleading because we only know it when it happens to us. To tell you the truth, that word is the opposite of what people say in private. They don\u2019t say it until it is very important to them. That is why we can say that it\u2019s a beautiful thing when we are walking together or in a crowd.\n\nI understand that in most areas, it is very natural and very healthy to be angry. But I would say that we are not really angry unless we are talking about bad or destructive things. I have to add and I have to say that you don\u2019t need to listen to me and that I do not want to use words that do harm to you. I am going to be an awesome person and you will have to wait for me to actually use them.\n\nWhen I said this, I was extremely excited and so many people told me that being angry for many of the other reasons would not help me to stay in business. That was true but I was getting a bit upset by that because I was so excited. I don\u2019t actually believe that and I don\u2019t want to hurt people.\n\nI said that this made me so angry when people were saying that it was all because we would not talk about positive things. I didn\u2019t say anything. I said that \u201cit\u2019s all because now you have to give me things that I am very excited about so I can do this.\u201d That\u2019s not what people said. They said it was all because if they could talk about positive things, what would it feel like?\n\nI said it was actually more like \u201cthis is going to be worth it\u201d but I was so excited because they were excited and they said that, because they believed that they got it for free and they made their decision after they were done with this whole thing in a way that allowed themselves to continue making the decision.\n\nIf you have not already realized or even thought of this, read the whole article below to see that I made the decision of this decision to let people choose what they wanted to do with their time. It is a process that I am going to use for the rest of my life. I hope you realize that this isn\u2019t about us. This is a process that I am going to be a good person for all my life and not just in business.","token_len":613,"entropy":[4.7428,5.3587,6.8213,3.819,7.118,4.6375,0.9703,3.9064,9.3052,5.4829,6.3371,2.9258,1.5749,6.5125,0.039,1.5334,2.5943,0.6798,6.5455,3.6778,7.1394,5.2422,1.325,1.6652,0.0269,2.7349,4.7731,1.2394,0.8964,1.2082,6.4401,0.9843,1.486,1.1473,5.9632,4.9629,5.2979,5.3506,1.2266,6.009,2.835,1.4494,1.0934,0.6567,0.4504,1.503,0.0003,2.1989,2.6648,3.7683,0.0493,4.0612,3.6989,2.3331,1.0898,2.6199,2.9408,5.0999,6.8876,4.203,3.6924,2.1421,4.5243,4.1276,3.4567,0.7172,4.7416,4.9076,0.8284,4.7782,0.4295,0.1792,4.742,3.0106,1.2785,1.4701,6.4558,4.6478,1.1258,3.847,0.7719,2.351,0.4123,2.2239,1.3604,0.5143,2.0587,6.4784,0.6259,5.6746,2.3344,5.9435,2.0821,3.716,2.8443,1.9045,7.775,0.9475,0.3193,0.8002,0.0001,4.3775,16.5393,7.6172,1.3608,2.665,4.7016,4.8085,2.7776,4.5941,0.3305,2.7172,7.8702,3.1861,4.7347,1.764,5.202,3.4278,3.9306,5.1472,2.2749,2.5619,2.3853,2.4857,4.0602,1.6648,0.5231,0.2804,5.5687,3.7987,0.5639,0.2943,0.0747,0.6801,3.7708,1.9773,1.0349,3.3031,4.9267,0.0914,1.2274,4.913,2.0241,4.1349,4.4859,0.6085,3.1552,2.6983,0.4747,2.0184,0.0122,2.0376,0.815,6.1962,1.0154,3.0184,5.6506,3.9714,1.346,0.3463,0.4811,3.7714,0.9152,1.4516,2.4696,3.5715,3.404,2.9743,2.6982,2.0628,0.0148,0.2571,2.3311,5.432,1.9199,2.7472,1.6821,1.8903,6.8406,3.7993,3.7271,2.842,1.3476,5.7205,0.7561,1.0314,0.0002,2.5342,5.0824,0.9214,4.5918,4.4785,5.4367,1.7566,2.8625,0.7849,2.8705,6.469,3.1538,3.4228,4.4294,0.3934,1.7184,5.6122,1.565,1.6277,2.0414,4.2819,2.6257,0.869,3.2744,1.6674,1.8687,4.3662,1.2911,4.4835,0.3637,0.7315,3.9768,0.2053,6.4146,4.5059,5.9448,0.7675,0.5426,2.7111,3.3781,3.6469,6.429,7.1178,2.5431,2.6781,0.2247,1.7992,0.7523,4.0453,3.0972,0.0243,0.1631,0.0068,2.3444,0.231,5.9242,0.1333,1.5732,3.3821,3.5161,1.582,2.6635,0.6051,2.3874,0.5054,4.6462,2.805,1.029,4.5274,6.4706,1.2408,0.489,0.4512,1.6003,2.38,2.3606,0.0103,3.4447,5.9582,5.4872,1.43,1.1384,2.7096,1.3051,3.7492,1.2081,6.2336,1.7011,0.3056,0.7028,6.148,2.3671,2.5646,0.3615,0.4005,0.0001,3.4396,0.9267,4.0888,3.0812,1.094,0.6979,1.8149,7.3605,3.6501,1.8943,4.4466,4.4878,0.3833,4.6362,0.0225,0.9212,6.1756,0.8455,6.4194,6.5187,4.7538,1.9337,5.7235,2.1134,4.5459,2.2113,1.8481,0.9046,3.9249,1.4636,0.3251,0.0277,0.4232,3.7086,1.8264,2.556,2.7843,1.276,2.3591,5.5475,3.3876,2.6913,4.5473,4.3805,1.5145,2.4158,0.8671,1.4451,3.0735,1.6866,1.8043,1.1668,3.9239,0.0479,0.0293,0.0021,6.3396,3.4808,0.7802,5.4014,0.5365,1.6135,0.0562,0.0155,0.0048,2.069,0.1748,4.1463,2.209,0.8676,1.7026,0.0001,1.3869,5.1353,1.2966,3.4942,6.7455,0.1486,3.8157,1.3534,4.0194,2.2301,3.168,1.443,0.6552,2.2746,1.1687,4.2813,3.5486,4.3073,5.1648,1.4022,3.7506,0.4023,6.2489,0.2001,1.043,1.3061,3.3017,0.0492,0.0376,0.0019,2.9099,3.4227,3.244,0.5293,1.805,0.5796,10.5719,6.6177,2.7702,0.5672,0.275,0.2292,2.0039,0.8739,7.613,2.6982,2.2686,1.125,4.9453,0.798,5.9485,1.3462,0.9126,3.1386,4.535,2.399,0.184,3.6339,0.6684,1.0482,3.3874,3.2967,1.0186,8.9836,8.1416,3.8093,2.8577,0.3815,0.5513,3.4747,1.6879,3.3676,3.4621,0.9677,2.714,1.1592,2.1978,2.0289,1.0013,0.4891,5.0695,2.8779,3.4248,1.6377,0.381,1.0834,0.0255,1.051,4.1479,0.8563,1.8309,4.0883,0.0184,1.1821,1.201,0.0001,1.2119,2.8338,2.6571,1.3607,6.796,3.8009,2.501,5.8855,1.1399,4.1943,1.1841,4.652,0.0362,1.2785,6.9188,0.7306,0.4184,3.4965,3.5747,1.1745,2.6879,2.6175,1.2234,1.7331,4.185,1.6575,5.602,2.8101,1.8194,2.8842,0.9539,5.404,3.0829,1.5653,4.4829,0.8034,2.7871,6.2217,2.9329,4.1934,2.11,2.092,1.3643,5.2964,3.8448,3.6806,4.726,2.8814,2.9707,2.7065,1.753,3.0106,4.0927,1.5946,5.8954,2.5439,2.9782,0.3474,6.0823,5.674,0.2101,3.8123,4.2968,3.0707,1.0948,0.8311,0.4733,0.0001,3.8991,0.7434,3.1395,3.3414,2.7621,5.1499,6.5926,4.655,3.0193,2.3559,1.3755,0.5219,6.2405,2.3591,2.5602,1.1435,4.0666,3.6631,1.7706,4.2349,1.5626,4.095,1.7066,1.1893,4.9936,3.5492,4.5803,3.6156,4.6299,1.8223,4.4061,1.125,0.6106,0.6484,0.6702,1.0134,0.9295,0.6784,2.3245,0.9052,2.804,1.0645,2.143,4.5109,0.9702,1.8608,2.408,1.3188,0.0094,2.2927,2.9865,1.6436,0.4268,0.0008,0.4016,0.0928,0.5499,1.9798,2.4801,1.0233,6.6818,0.6674,2.2697,4.4294,0.8816,0.4714,0.102,2.2801,5.2524,1.3293,1.8544,0.0711,2.9678,1.2799,0.4903,0.9557,0.8862,0.1601,0.0052,3.4554,3.8172,5.1835,0.9977,0.7376,4.6255,2.1695,0.1484,1.5093,4.9068,1.139,4.0099,2.2673,0.2866]}
{"id":403,"ended":true,"length":573,"text":"Randomize your music playlist. Hit Play. Write a funny or scary story based on the title of the song playing. Repeat the process on the next playlist.\n\nIn our music playlist we can control the playlist to choose the appropriate music to play. Here is an Example of Music playlist with the specific playlist:\n\nThis playlist gets started with the correct playlist of the background music (i.e. the background music from the previous playlist) and then we can control the playlist.\n\nChoose different songs, if the playlist is not playing, we can control the playlist to only play the song only if the background music is from another playlist.\n\nAfter the music select music and the background music will be replaced to match your favorite playlist.\n\n1. Connect the playlist to a computer\n2. If you have a browser and click the music select option in the top right corner or in the top left-hand corner of the file, you will be directed to the playlist selected.\n3. Make sure you click the \"Settings\" button in the upper left corner, or in the upper right-hand corner and to the right hand corner and click \"Add To Favorites\".\n4. If you click \"Add To Favorites\" then you will be directed to the playlist (i.e. the background music from previous playlist) and then the playlist will be replaced to match the background music.\n5. For this reason it is essential to check when changing the songs to match the playlist. Since we can choose the background music only and therefore the selected background music only, we can select the playlist only manually and in the same way by clicking the music select option in the top right-hand corner or in the lower left-hand corner.\n\n2. Once you have the selected music from the previous playlist in the same format, you can apply the new playlist to the new playlist.\n3. If you see the content of this playlist you should click on the Play button in the top right corner to make the selection process complete and then select the music from the new playlist.\n\n3. The playing time will have been adjusted. Now we can listen through the music playback process to the music selected by the task manager, and we can repeat the process. If you notice any errors after applying this adjustment, please let us know.\n\n5. Choose the current playlist and it will be automatically turned on and off after you select the playlist, and it will not automatically change to the playlist.\n\n6.

{"id":2312,"ended":true,"length":575,"text":"Write a seemingly straightforward comedy story that slowly and subtly becomes creepy and unnerving or downright horrifying, all while remaining under the guise of a light-hearted story.\n\nThe book is intended to be funny. Not sure a funny story about an alien, the world of the characters, or the world of the characters itself sounds quite out of place in the first page of your novel. The book is more like a thriller, a psychological thriller, not a movie. And because the stories are so thoroughly researched and detailed, the author is able to make the characters and the plot clear and entertaining. Some of the things that I liked were the way the author told the story and the way the author wrote it.\n\nOverall, the book has a lot of great reviews as well as a fair amount of really good stories to boot. I was actually a little disappointed with the pace here but a fair amount of the stories have a more realistic pace that people could relate to more. All that is in the form of an enjoyable, deep and engaging story that you don\u2019t want to miss.\n\nWhat a nice review from my own blog:\n\n\u201cThe first book I picked up in the ebook (and probably the second).\n\nIt is a very solid book that is a very solid read for a person who is not interested in making the most of their own time. If it didn\u2019t look at how you write\/write your own story, then it probably didn\u2019t look at what you write\/write your own story. But it is very funny and it has a lot of content that is both deep (such as the dialogue, or the characters) and light hearted.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend the book!\n\nThis review is only for the first edition. We are so sure it will be the most popular book on this list as well. But here is something else to look forward to:\n\nThis review is only for the first edition. We are so sure it will be the most popular book on this list as well. But here is something else to look forward to:\n\nThe book is based on a true story.\n\nIt tells the story of what happened while attempting to save a child from a nuclear blast in an old nuclear plant.\n\nThere was an explosion on May 18, 2008.

{"id":761,"ended":false,"length":581,"text":"The Lonely Knight by Jeff Buckley, The Doors by The Doors.\nBuckley's life and work, including writing about his own, are much more than just an autobiography. He's one of the earliest and most influential writers to have lived in rural America.\nThe Lonely Knight is the follow-up to the American Songwriters Association, one of the country's oldest and most influential voices for musicians.\nAdvertisement\nLonely Knight isn't one of the first country music writers to address the country.\nFor more than 30 years, country music has served as the country music equivalent of folkloric storytelling: as though toying with the people they love, one song has become a song with a happy ending.\nWhat's a typical tune to get in the mood for?\n\"We were in the middle of thinking that we can sort of put it down on our doorstep, let's go to dinner, find a place and we'll sing it with a little bit of love, or just write it down for everyone to enjoy,\" says singer John Goss.\n\"But unfortunately, we weren't able to do that. I'm the one that was actually able to.\"\nWith the exception of an early country tune, every single tune in The Lonely Knight is at least a song about love. To this day, the song is still known as a country tune because it's also used by the band in songs like \"Trouble in My Life\" and \"We Don't Have a Way to Make It.\"\nThere's simply nothing about the song that makes it a country tune. A songwriter shouldn't go on television, radio, or even in print, because so many songs are about love. But a country tune shouldn't even be one of those songs.\nThe song 'Trouble in My Life' is a common song about love.\nWhat should a country music songwriter do?\n\"I mean, there is so many different ways to get that song in the song. I think singing it for everyone to enjoy at the same time is a great way through the process. And you shouldn't even have to sing it for everyone to enjoy at the same time.\"\nGoss says that when he sang \"We Don't Have a Way to Make It\" by Jeff Buckley, it was considered an \"adventure story of love.\" Buckley didn't sing it in a \"religious\" way, so he couldn't sing it in a traditional church-like style or even with people's heads full of the music they enjoy.\n\"If the music was kind of like a story...it's a great way to get back into it,\" Goss says. \"And a lot of the songs there are very religious.\"\nWhat's the most common genre of an American song?\n\"I think everybody's been drawn into country music almost from the beginning, just from the beginning there,\" says Goss.\nThere are many genres, like country, music of many different types.

{"id":4385,"ended":true,"length":566,"text":"Dragons are the dominant species on earth, humans are about to go extinct. In a last ditch and dash effort a group of villagers seek to kill the King Dragon.\n\nThe town of Laguarava is very small, so they don\u2019t even know about the attack, and they have not found a means of gaining access to the castle. Some people have built an infinitude of tunnels around the castle, but so far none have managed to reach the castle. If they do, they will be killed soon and the castle will be destroyed.\n\nLaguarava isn\u2019t just one village. There are hundreds of villages. Their population is estimated to be somewhere around 1,500. This is where the city and the place where they have grown to be. Laguarava has one of the most beautiful villages in Brazil. It has amazing scenery, a stunning castle and beautiful music.\n\nBrazil has become a huge tourist state, the country is rich in history, this is where the King Dragon and all of his victims were found. He was known to have brought his victims in peace. Some of them lived in fear of their missing ancestors. Then, they found his victims and he killed the King Dragon. One person survived and the town where Laguerava was built was destroyed in flames.\n\nIn addition to this, there are more than 100 other townships, although almost all of them are in the middle of a rainforest right now. The city and villages are almost constantly being raided for treasure. Some of the villages are very far from their main townships, and therefore the locals get few meals and sleep the night away. The townships in the southernmost part of the country have been bombed by rain.\n\nThe area around Laguarava was also known as \u201cthe heart of the country\u201d, until it was overrun by a flood in 1989. It has become quite large, with the area around the city on average being 12 square miles.\n\nWhen a flood takes place, the town of Laguarava is the largest, and even though people are constantly in the water. In some places they have to go to rivers to escape. Now, you can see the river valley full of vegetation. The rivers in the southernmost part of the country have water pools and pools of water that can be used for drinking or cooking at any level.\n\nThe entire area has a water park which consists of the world\u2019s deepest water pools and can take up to a meter of water per person.

{"id":4270,"ended":true,"length":559,"text":"A student who was a loser in high school returns several years later to the reunion as a brutal dictator of a foreign country.\nShahab Hossain, 25, once competed in a three-nation tournament, the world's third-largest, while a junior from Syria returned in 2016 to compete in a one-hit wonder competition. A former CIA operative, he is the son of former American servicemen Ahmed Hassan Hassan and Muhammad Abdalla, and is also a co-author of the best-selling Iranian-language books on the subjects of war and nuclear bombs.\n\"This is not how we want to live,\" Hossain said when asked about his return. \"We will be together because everything is in our hands. We all just will have to be willing to live as citizens and work as a family again.\"\nHe said a \"bloody\" war crime that he said had been committed was an atrocity by U.S. troops targeting civilians in Somalia, which has claimed 25 U.S. troops. He said he hopes that he will never have to defend his country again or face justice.\nHossain and his family fled Somalia in 2011 when President Barack Obama visited them and threatened to kill them. They were living in the United States for eight years as Hossain's father. When their country seized power six years later, Obama vowed to use all forces needed to bring down the government of Somalia's Islamist president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. Obama also said he wants them back.\nThe family's return brought them to their beloved Afghanistan home, and they are both looking forward to visiting the next day or few days when they will again be together.\n\"A lot of people don't realize where we left off at first,\" said Hossain. \"We have no idea what is left. But we want to live as well.\"\nThe children said they were \"a different kid\" because they weren\u2019t forced to return to Somalia.\n\u201cWe always knew we were going back. We wanted to do something.\u201d\n\"I\u2019m in the same position,\" said Ahmed Hassan, who also graduated with a degree in philosophy from Washington's George Washington University.\nHe said he and his family used to work in Mogadishu before fleeing to Iran when he was about 13.

{"id":1023,"ended":true,"length":605,"text":"A Jedi and a Sith argue philosophy, and not on the merits of their respective philosophies, but a Jedi can be an expert, and a Sith can be a good scholar. Both have an important role in the process of discovering knowledge that needs to be learned, and they both give us a great deal of freedom to be both.\n\nThe Jedi are free, and they have nothing to fear. They make their very own rules and do not need to sacrifice.\n\nIt makes things more fascinating because they are learning as they go about their lives. They may be able to use their power to improve the world around them, but they will have to do so not as people they know but as people they think they are good to be trusted. Most people may think that having a Jedi teacher who has more than a simple opinion or an opinion is the right thing to do in helping them through a period of life, but that is not the case. When you have a Jedi mind who values ethics and is capable of thinking about and acting on their own, that brings great pleasure indeed to them and brings much, much peace.\n\nThe Sith know that everything that is said is true, regardless of what many people may think. When they are wise, they know that something important must take place, and they will do that in order not to have too much confusion and disappointment of any sort. When they are weak, they know of the power of weakness. They may feel like the only one who can handle the situation, but a Jedi mind can handle any circumstance, and they will do that without reason. If a Jedi is weak, the only way that this can occur is by some way too weak.\n\nThe Sith are free. Their life is a lot like any other day. In some ways, they like each other more than anything. They give of themselves to others for the sake of it. They have a purpose that enables them to be true disciples of any other life. They do not even need to be born in the same generation which may be more advanced than them, they just wish that they were born of the same birth.\n\nThe Jedi live in a world that is far away, and they must understand that.\n\nIt is time to go beyond the mundane at this level, and discover that freedom by living in the world which they have known throughout their lives should not be restricted or restricted by fear in a way that can be seen only through the naked eyes of the Jedi mind. With this in mind, and with love, they can begin to live in the world who has chosen them, and that is where they can begin to see the meaning of life.\n\nHow has this journey been the most fulfilling of your life? Have you been able to truly enjoy the life this journey has begun? Have you been able to be more than content and just enjoy this content of your life? As an educator, you are required to keep in mind the importance of this life journey, and the importance of every day being a blessing to these people.","token_len":619,"entropy":[11.8047,3.6753,1.4193,1.5187,11.031,11.4245,2.1264,2.1626,5.5855,5.0082,1.4405,3.9701,0.54,2.1798,2.5707,1.5533,1.4415,0.7133,5.7989,4.9119,4.7744,2.1808,3.2987,3.7209,3.7848,1.4646,0.9621,0.0654,0.5064,0.1907,0.7278,5.2577,3.4908,0.4546,3.7018,3.2978,3.7049,3.666,1.021,1.3562,0.7564,5.225,0.3907,4.4304,3.3955,3.1938,6.4955,0.206,0.0245,2.105,0.9583,0.7234,2.7541,2.1574,6.1738,4.4532,1.8641,2.7731,0.1116,0.1394,3.6918,0.857,3.7555,4.2403,2.5003,0.9079,0.0113,2.4006,2.208,1.8188,6.2535,2.7979,1.2466,2.1356,2.1051,5.3269,0.1796,0.6808,1.004,1.421,6.0646,1.9396,7.2778,1.9119,2.7251,2.1309,4.1663,1.029,2.9287,0.9593,6.6608,5.0721,2.4598,0.0002,4.3585,5.3553,5.9721,2.6646,5.3907,4.2568,1.5851,1.1315,6.1172,4.416,0.8047,0.611,4.8536,0.3014,1.7657,0.7284,1.4762,3.7861,1.9012,2.9121,0.0146,3.9847,0.9552,3.3279,0.7702,4.2281,1.6103,1.2373,3.1027,0.0246,0.3015,0.8815,0.6724,1.681,2.6702,0.4968,2.4503,0.8138,4.85,3.5059,5.5387,4.8282,1.7939,2.4537,0.3005,1.2292,0.592,4.6796,0.5301,1.3644,5.3217,4.9132,1.5389,7.3864,1.0998,6.1579,1.7092,5.3434,2.9909,1.3777,5.2004,1.1106,1.1389,5.2461,4.219,2.9785,4.9376,2.1492,1.7072,5.0882,5.8013,3.7527,3.442,1.5688,3.2537,2.6936,3.284,0.3453,0.0914,0.0609,4.1657,8.719,2.4344,4.7189,2.94,6.0391,0.055,3.9386,1.6235,0.3585,1.761,0.8068,0.4059,0.6766,0.13,0.1644,4.5013,1.4478,1.681,0.6273,0.8073,8.0796,3.415,6.417,6.442,0.7898,3.7363,4.5476,0.0248,4.1473,3.1346,4.0728,3.4381,0.8937,3.5218,0.3869,0.7139,3.0847,6.3307,3.7689,3.532,7.7777,1.9415,3.0691,2.2342,3.9162,4.1188,5.2927,0.0344,4.3443,1.4187,0.5286,0.0002,1.9302,1.6175,4.4792,1.5019,6.0122,2.5852,1.7674,3.9819,1.9674,1.3757,0.8439,5.6511,0.0373,1.3241,6.8244,1.1824,2.8353,0.3257,0.673,3.7472,1.062,1.9844,5.049,0.9186,0.4115,2.1291,0.65,4.7565,4.3815,3.5975,5.819,0.1725,1.3636,0.5443,1.1334,2.6519,1.5084,4.484,2.8288,1.9514,4.7317,0.0354,4.1472,4.9932,0.3521,4.833,1.838,5.2302,6.09,3.8641,1.6257,0.4387,2.4306,0.2505,0.4072,3.7757,0.2329,0.1437,0.4538,7.3923,2.6163,3.4677,0.7635,4.6905,2.1678,1.781,3.4624,3.5011,3.2347,3.1496,3.2065,2.8125,0.8021,0.7441,5.1697,1.4672,1.7423,0.6632,0.5729,5.7559,1.0405,5.1722,1.9192,2.2521,3.2623,5.8239,1.6151,0.7395,1.4345,1.2426,1.3213,2.4142,3.6529,7.9541,0.8441,3.9019,2.3011,0.6903,1.7545,1.9981,0.3996,3.0581,2.7398,1.3928,3.2423,5.847,2.0874,3.8575,0.085,2.6237,4.0106,4.2588,8.0523,2.9615,1.6929,1.0141,0.0002,1.5697,1.5153,1.7413,4.1049,1.6823,3.7977,4.6665,0.6178,2.9504,4.0679,2.5583,3.0852,0.203,5.5636,1.0753,4.6576,3.3298,0.3282,0.7551,1.1803,6.4969,5.8637,0.0473,1.7761,0.2604,4.4231,2.0504,1.0195,6.0616,6.7292,0.2515,1.2982,1.7749,2.6512,1.4655,0.9602,0.002,3.575,0.9089,1.0614,2.8127,1.8225,4.4992,3.7957,6.554,0.081,0.0544,2.7898,4.2504,5.3421,0.5954,6.5056,3.2692,3.8373,1.463,1.3041,2.4644,0.2014,5.6489,1.6006,0.5409,1.4166,4.4121,2.8104,1.6947,2.2149,4.7152,7.2149,5.0687,1.6914,4.0618,4.5488,0.7748,0.8281,1.5071,3.6559,1.3677,4.9338,2.3893,0.9699,1.7244,2.1352,5.2998,0.8408,0.0461,4.4129,0.8958,1.0512,0.0002,1.5598,1.0309,4.9041,1.4381,1.1322,1.1951,1.6618,0.6467,3.0729,3.346,1.3726,1.5557,1.3208,4.2382,5.0122,0.9299,2.3032,3.106,0.0002,3.5242,0.5247,4.67,1.0181,3.6669,3.5626,1.1444,5.4699,6.9499,2.5804,6.5622,1.665,0.9235,6.3544,3.0831,5.9753,6.6584,4.8406,1.2262,1.7437,1.6447,4.5063,3.3158,2.119,3.797,6.274,0.4289,1.0249,6.8804,1.0419,0.4095,4.5078,3.5159,2.2865,2.0514,5.2233,6.413,3.6323,0.7356,0.372,3.8358,1.3134,3.3176,3.8854,1.438,1.0608,7.1097,1.6251,0.0284,1.465,0.7198,3.687,0.1589,6.5764,2.0311,1.813,0.0103,0.0868,3.9988,1.0542,5.5637,1.8144,2.511,3.2161,3.3634,0.3132,3.0883,1.7759,1.7104,0.628,7.9165,3.452,5.7198,1.0735,1.7558,0.9015,2.9192,1.1526,4.2383,1.3587,2.6036,1.2994,0.1408,2.9327,1.1154,4.4839,0.3804,1.1896,0.7165,0.4335,0.0002,5.3587,6.6286,1.5473,4.2207,0.938,5.3513,3.1983,2.5139,2.1703,0.8717,0.4859,0.2439,3.0388,0.124,2.0662,1.8788,0.007,4.7674,3.9835,1.7963,2.5789,6.7463,3.1155,0.2459,7.437,2.9057,1.7874,0.0359,1.4042,0.306,0.0065,3.4494,3.9734,2.7594,6.1997,2.8169,5.3209,2.7101,3.6761,6.2599,3.6893,2.3077,0.0439,0.4591,5.3887,3.7584,3.7643,0.6536,2.3785,2.1127,5.2345,0.0878,4.9512,2.5383,0.2619,1.5671,3.1802,0.09,2.8567,2.168,5.6293,1.3086,0.5737,2.0784,1.0909,0.1421,5.6098,2.8373,2.8358,1.9584,6.9371,1.5735,4.7025,1.3018,0.7752]}
{"id":4322,"ended":true,"length":582,"text":"You've perfected the ability to predict the future. But now, the government has a much harder task for you to accomplish. You must predict the past...\n\nThe future is a new world where everything will be a reality soon -- including you, the world you're living in. However, you have an important problem-solving task:\n\nIn order to overcome any obstacle involved in your new world, you must decide how you'll live the present. If you will choose one of the following options:\n\nTo overcome any obstacle involved in your new world, and\n\nTo give up. That means you have to learn two things. One is that the future is the dream of tomorrow, that your present will be a reality in a relatively short time. The second is that it will be the one in which you choose to live \u2014 that is, the one you choose to live.\n\nOf course, you should never be willing or able to do anything that would make you or anyone else a threat. But what if you did? Imagine that you could give up life just because you're willing to give up the dream or life for anyone else? Then don't give up life. That is the dream, and that means you can't make that one your eternal life.\n\nIf you choose to give up your life for anyone else, you would forever change. If you choose to give up the dream or life for anyone else, you would forever become a terrorist known as \u201cDaesh.\u201d When you do this, you would turn away from those who are the ones who are trying to change your lives. You wouldn't be able to live right now if you choose to give up the dream or life for anyone else.\n\nThen you would become \u201cDaesh.\u201d\n\nTo be \u201cDaesh\u201d means to resist all attempts to change what can be achieved. When you're ready, you can go to the \u201csafe\u201d area, where you will find a small gate guarded by a small group of armed terrorists. Then you can enter the secure area and pass through in the same direction which you are trying to enter.\n\nThe only downside is that you would never be able to go back to your dream or new life and would be unable to leave the house. If you decide on either of these options, you would always be able to escape and, if you got a chance, it doesn't matter what happens to you after you finish your dream, because it's a dream that can be changed.\n\nBy the way, keep your hands away from the door! That thing's going to keep trying to tell you that you're not the only one with that problem! You might be able to overcome the obstacle, but it might take you a while to figure it out.\n\nTo live with a dream, one has to be good enough to survive it. Otherwise, you will be miserable because you could see you are getting sick of all the changes that you already can't make.","token_len":620,"entropy":[5.5189,10.2065,1.5666,4.6487,0.0654,6.0148,1.7307,1.3182,1.4639,3.7209,3.5954,1.5803,3.5243,5.9751,1.691,3.0173,4.1806,2.1561,2.9391,5.161,0.2,1.4824,2.8724,0.7294,2.9095,2.1432,6.6313,1.0884,5.6089,7.0428,2.2924,0.0168,2.8747,3.8269,0.8566,2.7666,5.4316,2.7973,3.7545,3.2832,2.5405,0.5854,3.5816,6.108,7.7563,6.5414,5.2223,2.2804,2.0578,2.0256,3.9033,2.9438,3.0326,1.6848,0.111,0.4682,5.0572,0.0767,1.6918,2.5756,4.065,2.6423,3.6143,8.042,2.9099,0.0797,1.7335,2.3489,4.1138,0.0002,4.9178,0.9036,0.0968,5.3436,5.1129,3.4535,8.6678,0.6608,1.6658,4.5128,1.2619,0.1782,0.2039,0.4735,4.7451,2.1437,1.8446,2.0847,2.49,3.3775,4.7065,0.7981,3.6469,0.256,5.0709,3.0167,3.6321,1.6272,1.0069,1.0016,2.4647,1.3663,0.6468,0.0004,5.0736,7.829,2.0958,0.5217,2.7307,0.0472,0.1837,0.2915,0.0483,0.2506,6.5988,4.864,0.0003,0.4921,7.0436,0.5821,4.4401,5.3654,1.9006,1.8561,2.0008,0.0905,4.5275,7.1186,0.9075,2.3414,2.4717,1.2789,1.5363,2.8451,1.6294,0.7809,4.1304,7.5313,1.589,5.7809,1.2852,4.3272,3.4911,3.7005,1.8407,0.789,2.2526,1.3064,2.8263,2.3445,6.1603,0.0999,0.9169,0.7811,1.3638,2.1842,0.1874,0.1011,3.3457,1.8245,0.7635,2.0761,3.8642,4.0923,0.4009,0.3244,4.4544,0.5434,0.2806,8.7308,2.8666,1.0784,0.1093,1.4782,0.3875,1.9337,2.2923,0.1208,0.5261,2.6144,0.9223,0.0002,5.7426,0.085,0.12,1.6571,4.1421,1.9786,2.931,5.9281,4.4383,0.0504,0.0073,3.3092,1.6366,2.2098,2.1427,1.8516,0.5612,4.7148,1.4745,0.2604,3.8937,3.7241,1.5076,2.0911,3.7674,1.2259,0.442,3.7849,1.5975,5.6018,2.1644,0.5457,3.733,5.0897,0.3567,5.7032,4.6247,1.8006,0.4729,2.7249,5.5078,0.1829,2.4598,0.0677,2.6673,1.7933,4.7482,3.6279,4.3964,6.8757,1.6482,1.1358,3.7414,6.1027,0.0019,2.6249,0.0351,3.6327,1.2621,3.405,2.1223,2.0391,3.5535,3.2567,1.2298,2.1937,3.7687,0.7122,3.011,1.1397,4.6256,2.4603,3.465,6.1952,8.3542,2.8183,0.2367,0.5949,0.0001,3.1478,0.1934,2.3826,0.6214,2.289,0.0253,1.7573,1.5554,1.7936,1.1829,0.2918,0.2232,1.1252,4.4579,7.1437,4.0404,5.0581,3.2253,0.1338,1.023,0.1245,0.7179,0.019,2.3973,0.7544,1.8429,0.2117,0.362,0.729,0.048,0.1182,0.4144,0.9109,1.7376,2.9096,1.0154,5.4499,8.3131,0.5937,13.2286,5.5801,6.6749,1.9164,1.0046,7.2252,8.0852,5.8779,0.6869,3.992,1.7025,0.1047,0.7036,2.312,5.3191,4.9952,0.2272,5.1026,0.4404,1.9872,3.626,3.8475,0.624,1.673,3.3691,0.0193,3.9463,1.6932,4.1795,0.6181,1.9617,3.57,0.001,1.2545,1.2047,0.0029,3.0581,7.1544,0.1753,2.8566,0.1893,4.3068,0.3183,0.7347,0.0302,1.7879,0.3935,0.4125,0.0504,0.4225,0.5307,0.0535,0.1696,0.5035,0.0001,6.0628,1.4921,0.9643,1.8264,5.3993,0.0674,0.4035,0.0196,0.4869,0.4684,0.1042,1.0956,0.0001,4.6729,2.5254,6.586,0.0202,0.0085,0.0181,4.8044,0.1637,4.2958,0.8553,6.6873,3.0457,2.8894,0.5251,0.2529,4.2215,6.5532,0.6565,3.8325,1.3614,4.4707,0.3431,4.0231,3.5421,1.2556,0.7271,1.4969,3.3954,1.4614,1.6874,5.6902,0.3137,8.5109,2.7532,1.372,3.8383,2.2462,1.2079,0.5543,1.622,2.4325,1.8555,4.3431,7.3097,4.0194,0.0636,1.5541,3.0793,1.3403,0.0728,3.9109,2.9505,0.5227,4.3591,0.8825,1.4214,2.6549,0.8896,6.2897,0.6311,1.0626,5.2379,0.2211,6.7634,1.8207,3.5594,2.5294,6.3575,1.0013,4.1116,4.7588,0.0137,1.3673,0.4484,1.2531,0.0001,2.6862,2.8809,6.5059,2.0122,0.0918,0.8604,1.9073,2.4508,1.0639,0.1685,0.0018,3.2796,1.9537,0.6439,1.0904,3.2414,1.9173,5.8559,0.6641,3.6135,4.6395,1.959,3.1384,0.01,4.0799,1.5916,5.1662,1.273,2.7632,0.1433,3.1477,4.8368,4.8417,0.8026,0.5058,1.172,0.1279,0.5985,1.8717,4.8141,1.1349,3.9486,0.0029,3.1653,3.4847,4.9925,1.8747,0.3389,6.8053,3.8811,1.8671,0.5122,4.7419,6.1339,0.0007,0.2863,1.3625,3.1082,1.1716,0.0813,4.2763,1.2486,4.8385,1.4166,2.0868,3.1013,1.5905,2.9371,1.3754,3.7895,2.718,2.4611,3.3244,1.3774,1.3165,0.9791,0.4464,0.0001,5.6523,2.3498,0.3993,0.0722,6.4534,4.8048,4.6169,4.8678,0.2122,1.5118,1.3382,4.4147,3.6687,6.8445,4.1472,2.6315,0.0411,4.5636,4.744,0.0967,5.0517,0.0409,1.4083,0.5527,1.0688,1.5734,4.0428,1.4353,0.109,4.1147,2.9693,2.8623,3.0442,3.1572,3.3209,2.2706,0.7134,0.0038,5.2352,2.1885,3.9027,1.972,0.31,2.0085,3.1696,1.8412,1.3632,0.7676,1.2451,0.7576,2.7045,1.2181,0.0288,0.2546,0.7396,0.0001,4.2205,5.6859,3.6681,2.597,1.937,2.0404,4.382,2.176,0.0214,2.648,6.3607,3.0001,0.8635,3.626,2.2386,0.3279,4.5925,0.2528,1.0452,1.8306,2.0339,4.7283,4.5226,0.6323,4.712,6.4259,5.2123,3.5001,4.7009,4.6057,2.9748,4.4639,0.7567,6.172,1.1448,2.3726,5.881,5.4352,0.9839,3.5519,0.6144]}
{"id":1692,"ended":false,"length":595,"text":"An troll challenges someone over the internet to `` fight him IRL ''. That someone turns out to be Superman, who is bored of fighting evil, and now spends his time beating up internet trolls.\n\n''It\u00eds a joke!\"\n\n''It goes so fast!!! \"\n\n''A good friend of mine, who is also a troll, tells me she has the same problem as you. She''s a female, and I''m a male so she can not fight the trolls. She says she believes that everything that is said in the movies is true. At the end she says if nothing else, it keeps her healthy and not sick. She''s a bad girl!\n\n''Actually, I never meant that the trolls are evil, but that because everything they do is false. That all those are people they are not to be trusted with their money!''\n\n''My problem with a good friend of mine is always that she feels like I don&#8217;t understand her and doesn&#8217;t even have any confidence. That&#8220;s why they don&#8217;t let me know that they have no belief, that I&#8217;m not strong enough, that I can&#8217;t solve the problem, that I&#8217;m not good enough. When their attitude is like that, it makes you feel like they&#8217;re not being supportive when you need them most of the time. I just can&#8217;t ignore that. My problem with my friend is that I don&#8217;t feel right. She didn&#8217;t believe that I was the way I was and that my money should go to my friends. Sometimes I wonder why she felt this way. When she was a kid, I was a lot like her. I had no energy about me. When I was older, I was less like her and more like his wife. But it seems to me that I have no energy, and I know when to do things. I just don&#8217;t want to do anything about it.\n\n''A little bit of history is true, but it is not for my entertainment!

{"id":3631,"ended":true,"length":558,"text":"A pandemic has brought the world to its knees. After extensive research, scientists have concluded that the pandemic initially began through restaurant staff, people responsible for touching food but who are not allowed sick days.\n\nThe virus spread through close contact with people, most of them health care workers, before the world started experiencing outbreaks, according to a report from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn the U.S., 1,078 people were infected across the world with the deadly virus. And 1,024 deaths were reported, bringing the total to 43,032. At the height of the outbreak, nearly 700,000 people have been infected globally.\n\nWhile some experts were more concerned about the virus than others, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he sees some signs that people are still avoiding public gatherings.\n\n\"Based on a recent survey of the public, we also know that there's a much larger subset of people that are in most areas, and that that really may have been more active in those areas than we thought,\" Fauci told a press conference.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks as a person wearing a face mask walks past the lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in early 2019. Joon-Hoon Kim\/Pool via AP\n\nFor some, Fauci's comments echo a sentiment that other health care experts have expressed.\n\nThe president of the World Bank, which helped finance the outbreak, said it had to act on that advice, adding, \"We don't have the answers to all this.\"\n\nBut Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the head of the World Bank's emergency health program, agreed that \"people have this tendency to stay home when they are sick.\"\n\n\"They are in the same areas where they were. And they're more alert around that area... than they are around the rest of the world,\" Ferrer told a news conference.\n\n\"I think that's going to be critical as we are moving into a new period of global concern about this pandemic.\"\n\nResearchers have estimated that the COVID-19 illness causes more than 1 billion infections in the world. And, Fauci warned, \"There is a great chance it's going to cause more than 1 billion COVID-19.\"\n\n\"All the scientific evidence points to an exponential spread and an accelerating crisis,\" he added, referencing the Wuhan epidemic which caused the virus. \"And that means the global response, not just for the US but around the world, the whole world... we have to work together to save the

You're a newly sworn in Senator being briefed on this for the first time.\n\nThe American dream for those of us who remember the beginning of America's founding has disappeared from the public consciousness.\n\nInstead, the very essence of American democracy has become one of the most toxic and corrosive forces that have ever existed in our country and we will experience a new cycle of violence if it takes root.\n\nThe only way to defeat this toxic and corrosive forces is to change America to a people of its people. The people of our country are a united, driven, resolute, resilient and resilient force.\n\nWe must rebuild our people.

We must understand that what we want to achieve as the republicans can only be achieved through the whole of the American people.\n\nThe time for us to be united is now, and we must rise to that need and do all we can to stop these vicious forces that have been driving our nations in the same direction for so long.\n\nWe must put together a working group to fight back through the process.\n\nWe must rebuild our people.

{"id":2619,"ended":true,"length":598,"text":"Ten thousand years from now the human race has separated into to sperate sects. Those who perused improving the human race through genetic enhancement and gene splicing and those who sought to improve themselves through technology ( Cyborgs ).\n\nThe most interesting thing about gene splicing, however, is that they are being done in a much faster process, while being a complete different product of human genetics. As the world is changing through genetic modification, there are new ways for those of us who are working on the genome to transform. And because the genetic system hasn\u2019t changed in 10 years, we don\u2019t have to worry about the biological changes that are occurring. That means we won\u2019t even encounter any major human rights violations by the human race.\n\nToday there are 6.23 million humans worldwide. The biggest change in those are people who are not genetically different from ordinary people. That might be an increase of 20% a year from the 30 million people we have today. Even in the United States, the U.S. has been significantly under a 100% rise in all sex ratios in the last century. In the UK that number has decreased from 70% in the 1950 or so onwards to 54%. So that brings us to the real change in the sex ratio of mankind\n\nSo what we see today is that the world is undergoing a massive change in sex ratios. Most of us have been growing an average of six-tenths of a percent faster than other nations in the past ten years. And now there is a whole new set of ways to reduce the genetic variation of the human race.\n\nGenetic modifications have been made so that we can use DNA ( a complex process by which the human genome is engineered in order to modify the production of enzymes and DNA, and the process of making proteins ) to alter our reproductive and reproductive systems. We are using genetic modification to decrease the genetic variation of all living beings including mammals (humans can have as many as eight, but there is little genetic variation of humans among mammals) and monkeys (who now eat more trees than humans), and dolphins and reptiles.\n\nWe are also using genetic technology to decrease the gene diversity in the human race which may be partly responsible for genetic variation in the development of certain diseases, such as AIDS.\n\nOur efforts would be much easier if there would be no genetically modified animals in the human race. But it seems that this can be turned into a natural process, and a step in the right direction. In a short period of time scientists will be able to reduce the population of animals in a given country by 50%. After that we will need to develop a whole new breeding stock for the new species and then there will be no more problems with the original population.\n\nWe have reached the point where we can use genetic modification to eradicate all the genetic variation in the human race. What this means is that the whole human race will be able to reduce the genetic variation through the techniques that we use now in the laboratory and then put it into the clinical practice of our own work.","token_len":626,"entropy":[8.6421,2.6613,3.5643,0.0402,3.3953,4.529,0.6103,3.279,8.4744,1.241,9.9129,9.3465,5.8024,7.0698,1.6112,4.4185,0.9872,7.4327,5.9416,15.7627,1.6635,2.7111,0.9007,4.8523,6.3869,4.9222,2.4304,4.315,6.1888,0.0019,4.0612,3.5717,0.1272,4.159,0.6214,3.0125,3.4768,0.303,4.8384,5.7988,15.344,2.0509,5.0955,1.7573,0.2512,2.1335,4.6602,4.0673,2.42,0.4652,8.214,0.7784,0.0012,3.1525,2.4687,0.0242,0.1855,0.3689,4.1579,1.4516,6.3377,3.2057,1.89,1.3616,4.1142,3.7481,4.2585,2.8357,5.2967,4.4634,4.8709,5.8137,5.953,5.4741,2.7061,3.0631,2.7847,0.6561,3.7695,2.6429,4.5254,2.9798,3.3248,5.5028,3.1899,2.0547,0.6587,3.1869,1.4407,4.1356,3.1648,2.5574,3.9671,3.3544,0.7755,0.7577,1.7125,5.8214,1.1192,1.5937,4.8941,0.3938,6.5934,4.5295,3.9182,4.1769,2.3638,3.5567,6.063,6.4703,17.2289,8.1331,1.4684,0.9222,2.5817,5.0515,1.7515,0.3163,1.9662,3.5064,0.9511,0.833,0.0394,0.7965,0.4983,1.2551,0.1347,2.2017,6.2947,0.9773,1.069,1.8292,2.2201,1.4604,4.4399,2.532,1.5714,4.5762,0.2049,0.1099,0.2666,5.4774,7.3138,2.3785,3.9722,4.4566,6.0802,1.1721,3.9537,1.8593,3.5327,0.818,0.8976,0.6111,0.0003,5.6817,3.435,0.3153,5.9938,1.9163,6.572,0.7533,3.7133,2.8136,1.9285,2.4321,5.9273,3.9145,1.7398,5.6354,7.0011,4.7226,1.4376,0.939,3.6219,2.4569,2.7808,0.5953,6.4737,0.7913,0.6594,3.5314,5.9911,1.7922,4.1045,3.5209,0.6743,3.9554,1.629,5.4868,0.2406,3.2123,2.0044,6.0233,2.0359,1.6847,3.3503,1.6779,0.5001,0.6189,5.2776,3.0038,1.034,3.4151,0.0245,0.5489,2.2554,5.5932,0.0027,0.0263,0.0882,1.7517,3.0455,5.1967,4.1214,5.1856,4.3696,0.4033,5.3277,0.2809,5.4575,7.414,2.4322,2.9602,0.9339,0.7475,4.0022,0.4823,2.8375,1.7528,5.0981,5.7608,2.518,1.4256,4.8348,1.7228,4.6798,0.8728,1.1027,1.2241,1.9788,9.4895,3.3356,5.269,0.6477,6.0584,1.6877,4.3724,3.4899,6.1864,0.6562,0.2283,0.8917,4.3012,3.005,1.5387,1.144,7.1913,0.313,1.8664,4.9628,6.911,0.0002,3.7869,2.1524,3.5867,3.1045,2.2849,0.5845,1.6121,1.7861,3.2817,0.5347,3.9428,0.6597,3.0144,1.1641,0.9067,4.6925,0.6491,0.7395,5.2169,0.8662,2.4986,2.1353,1.8464,5.2261,6.3308,1.112,0.1278,4.9479,3.4551,3.273,0.0216,0.0112,0.1852,0.255,2.2864,5.6526,0.3376,4.8528,5.9059,1.8373,0.9967,2.0123,3.5896,0.4708,0.3866,2.3993,4.1474,2.7948,1.2166,1.027,4.5377,0.4414,2.8531,0.0102,3.4449,1.2284,4.5295,1.1777,5.2988,3.5554,1.8164,1.9576,0.3223,0.3235,0.4886,1.2521,0.0002,4.9302,0.3449,3.922,2.3906,1.1928,3.4489,3.9556,0.4304,1.9582,1.0063,3.9466,3.6645,5.0377,6.0942,4.6103,4.4673,4.9596,0.0282,2.4416,2.4599,0.5569,0.863,4.9088,4.0842,2.0518,0.0312,4.2668,1.583,6.7701,0.2435,5.6461,1.7464,3.7447,4.092,2.3971,3.0297,3.8265,0.9825,3.2884,1.3989,4.4451,0.4574,3.4392,2.0804,2.5378,2.8917,1.2956,2.4062,0.404,2.7446,1.881,2.9369,2.6582,0.8231,0.3288,5.5389,0.6461,3.2987,1.3067,0.4409,3.668,2.705,2.2575,5.5724,3.9006,4.4331,4.3632,5.6337,2.5855,2.9742,0.2177,0.1682,3.8433,4.5585,2.3432,3.5472,1.2005,4.8271,2.4976,1.0336,3.0027,2.4478,4.3662,1.3083,2.554,0.8633,6.6614,1.1702,6.1265,7.5711,6.0732,3.143,7.6168,1.1602,1.4185,3.6327,1.0245,10.8447,1.5588,8.4046,1.493,1.1986,0.0003,2.7542,0.8196,1.7667,0.4577,0.9504,5.9217,0.1562,3.9432,0.3968,4.9969,5.8556,2.4777,1.3052,0.5413,1.6245,4.8241,4.3711,2.0017,6.1903,1.5004,0.0187,6.42,2.9262,0.9037,1.4587,5.6278,0.1026,3.1239,1.712,2.1383,1.1108,0.0016,3.2183,1.0783,1.4377,0.0003,4.4788,4.6745,6.3514,1.2936,2.9136,2.8038,0.2148,3.0565,4.3786,0.1963,0.8489,4.7059,1.0129,3.2948,1.8549,0.3147,2.6804,0.4111,0.4831,2.2204,3.3784,2.9081,0.5211,3.4793,5.4542,1.4137,6.1434,1.1582,0.6822,6.7001,2.8093,2.555,1.7371,4.1676,5.3748,1.3515,0.1635,0.1913,0.0014,0.4831,3.484,3.1124,4.9508,1.8938,0.1296,0.0277,4.7514,1.4247,0.5025,0.2091,0.0154,3.7397,0.4054,3.7953,0.4616,2.9765,2.3656,3.5265,3.5532,2.5324,0.6661,3.0156,1.3159,6.5954,0.8248,1.9879,0.8289,3.014,0.4177,4.2064,1.8009,2.8954,0.1658,5.6749,4.2479,2.8632,2.2289,4.0501,0.7963,3.0594,3.1534,4.7587,0.5023,0.1268,2.0363,1.7963,3.9162,1.2728,1.7048,5.753,1.9221,0.6891,0.7607,0.0003,2.9247,2.1704,5.1801,1.1386,0.4946,0.3823,1.1376,1.5008,3.1582,0.9579,0.5143,0.3125,5.6974,2.1824,1.9962,2.3804,1.8028,1.1324,0.7685,0.2008,0.0814,0.6705,5.0367,3.587,0.1573,0.4316,0.1175,2.4336,4.5623,0.9635,0.2049,0.9641,0.675,3.497,0.0071,6.1637,0.9212,1.4379,0.8502,5.5973,2.8873,5.8204,2.3672,0.787,1.9321,3.2945,3.1162,1.3981,2.7568,2.0521,3.7891,5.6199,1.5052,1.0201,1.7116,6.8241,1.8588,0.8166,3.7617,1.3543,5.9596,0.3169]}
{"id":84,"ended":true,"length":595,"text":"All injuries, emotional or physical, are displayed on a person in the form of a scar. You come across a man covered head to toe in disfiguring marks, speaking with a woman who bears only a single scar. You have not seen the man before, he doesn\u2019t have scars. You don\u2019t have the courage, courage or strength to show off. You aren\u2019t strong enough, you don\u2019t possess the self-willed determination. You don\u2019t know the strength to share the stories, you don\u2019t know the courage to share our stories.\n\nI want to give all of you an opportunity to share your stories, and how you have reacted to them, by speaking up, even if you seem too afraid to say them. You are a strong person who is willing to speak up. Let\u2019s be brave, and share our stories.\n\nMy Name is Michelle. I belong to New York City, which has become a place for the LGBT community and my personal life in New York is where that really started. I chose New York because everyone I met there was very different. They all took my place because of what I had done in their lives, that I had to give to them and for them, I was proud of.\n\nSo I got to enjoy this place, that was a place where people I loved and who had been with me forever were going through it at a really strange pace. Like you told me, I wanted this place to be like this place \u201c, I decided to go there for only a few weeks. It was so much better than the rest of the city. When I was back in the city the next week I was so excited to go back, and the way I felt right at home in New York City was so special \u201c, and it felt like I was so proud to be a part of \u201c, as well as the people that I have met.\n\nAs my relationship with Michelle was growing, \u201c, I started to get to know her more and more, just by feeling myself in her and my body is something I never thought I could get \u201c, the feeling of being close to myself, feeling alive, at home, and feeling like what I wanted is what I wanted. I would even go in front of her and she would look at me and say \u201cwhat about you? \u201d. The moment at that moment, I felt that I was a part of it for a long time, and since then, I had that feeling of being in a place that I don\u2019t see every day, but that is what really makes for such strong and loving people. In the moment, they are always in my mind and I feel that is the most powerful feeling I can ever have \u201c.\n\nI am so happy now to see how well things are starting to go again in terms of the place that they were in the last year or so. I will be there over the next few days and see you, \u201c.","token_len":627,"entropy":[10.2377,2.9445,8.2953,3.2328,1.6991,0.1926,1.6051,8.3763,1.9874,2.3075,3.7204,5.0121,1.5195,3.669,0.0137,1.7635,4.9931,1.8598,5.5333,8.5691,2.207,2.1081,4.397,7.3424,6.9381,0.4862,0.7212,1.0744,7.4919,3.5827,0.2325,6.5773,1.6697,11.1278,2.44,1.2925,4.9262,1.9308,7.3731,5.523,1.1294,2.6359,3.1434,1.6,2.1746,3.5944,5.3577,1.3835,2.3922,1.8167,3.3612,1.4781,4.5243,5.1315,16.0682,7.7448,1.6856,1.8345,2.4326,1.0674,2.0652,3.8798,0.5507,0.5608,0.0043,2.0665,2.5441,4.001,3.8095,3.4752,3.2698,3.313,0.1274,4.6555,3.6236,2.9226,1.6364,5.8566,0.0813,0.3263,0.0011,5.2445,0.0418,3.6366,1.1284,1.2107,0.0181,0.0091,0.0006,5.4275,0.3324,4.5794,0.2152,6.7555,0.2188,2.6395,3.4781,1.0718,0.8879,0.0104,0.0102,0.0008,2.0683,2.2706,3.7378,0.8264,6.9305,2.0474,6.1436,2.7691,2.7966,0.3136,0.0036,0.007,0.0011,0.7429,0.4197,1.3113,0.3405,2.0143,6.3427,0.9091,0.896,1.9558,0.015,3.6978,3.1753,0.5968,3.9528,5.3036,0.6604,0.662,2.4762,0.7519,0.1776,1.8998,1.3766,1.0163,1.9859,2.3972,5.9155,1.2705,2.4925,5.4117,0.6543,2.1254,1.758,4.2651,4.5415,2.5522,2.28,5.7081,0.6133,0.9235,6.7483,4.6499,2.8046,0.4503,2.8614,3.4171,0.524,2.8334,1.9475,2.8998,4.0584,1.301,2.2305,1.9562,2.4475,0.0321,2.2987,0.7549,1.3563,5.1935,4.2637,0.2859,0.8931,3.1283,4.4302,1.3813,2.3596,4.0448,1.1905,0.1797,0.9696,0.957,0.0003,4.7212,4.4282,0.3359,6.0762,1.9939,0.8331,6.5419,0.066,6.6945,0.9612,1.0328,2.0894,4.1215,2.8087,3.807,1.3059,2.4662,2.8205,3.2103,3.9442,0.0976,2.9942,3.7172,5.5053,2.3159,3.6864,5.2497,0.0108,6.1037,5.9307,5.3528,6.8289,1.9541,0.317,0.9984,5.6675,0.9603,0.0038,1.088,7.0371,3.5384,2.486,4.1314,1.5002,3.3684,3.2033,1.4352,4.5086,2.0378,6.1042,3.3995,3.7188,4.2858,1.6442,3.0683,0.619,1.9069,1.8277,2.4306,3.1416,0.6277,1.4866,4.3903,1.4806,1.0288,4.9681,4.5094,2.6086,1.0764,2.17,3.8282,1.1706,2.3424,2.6236,2.4493,3.8547,0.7793,2.4924,1.5158,0.0002,4.2066,1.6343,4.9735,1.6353,6.8363,3.4163,1.6843,1.61,3.7858,1.8369,2.291,3.5373,1.0591,1.8542,5.8766,4.0,2.6571,2.6033,2.1723,2.3951,3.3179,0.163,6.0076,2.1029,3.9642,2.9519,3.7755,5.4793,1.8831,3.7087,7.0239,5.4072,0.4986,5.4979,3.67,4.7095,0.2398,0.6044,1.9686,2.9085,4.1687,0.3534,0.5061,0.4309,2.5682,2.7321,0.8247,10.7427,5.0657,4.1122,3.059,6.3172,0.7355,1.9587,1.8322,3.1774,6.1337,1.3052,1.3427,2.0649,1.2244,2.4581,0.5466,3.085,2.6258,2.637,0.6537,2.2444,3.1812,0.3294,0.4145,1.712,0.9927,5.0543,0.3392,2.8904,4.8581,1.3358,2.0273,1.918,4.6924,2.4947,2.7151,1.452,1.629,2.938,1.807,1.172,1.2309,2.1351,2.6154,2.0734,3.6512,4.745,1.2254,1.0443,4.9757,3.0586,0.3591,2.8979,1.0196,0.0042,1.588,1.0604,1.9361,4.5725,5.3554,0.1392,0.8941,2.4122,1.9847,2.5248,1.3308,1.2497,0.8893,4.9795,4.3607,1.9319,0.5185,2.3227,0.0867,0.0018,7.8257,0.0265,1.0655,4.6695,1.5579,0.7367,2.9701,2.1629,1.8367,1.0685,2.9859,2.0664,2.0058,0.8058,0.0001,4.4417,4.6927,4.8794,0.1815,4.7621,4.0836,1.452,0.7792,9.8084,0.1575,0.2622,0.8895,2.4761,1.0715,3.1613,2.906,0.2927,0.9503,1.4944,1.2406,0.8046,1.5823,5.4503,2.5054,4.5931,5.8531,1.7151,0.2114,3.0807,3.5664,3.497,7.0466,4.6862,1.1914,4.0078,1.8944,0.778,2.0212,3.9641,8.4071,0.071,0.4935,4.513,2.8591,0.7621,1.1565,4.8579,0.4482,4.228,1.6119,3.2989,5.6737,1.2868,6.29,1.4213,1.1863,1.7602,2.7541,1.9999,6.1448,0.6603,2.5135,3.2691,2.3767,0.3658,1.4748,0.6834,1.4853,4.6303,6.1187,1.5946,3.9859,4.5175,0.0121,1.2851,1.166,2.8279,0.1011,3.3148,0.395,0.0683,0.9424,1.3015,2.8307,0.1159,6.2408,5.566,0.5322,0.763,2.2668,5.7956,3.3623,4.7821,4.0509,8.0435,2.7517,0.418,1.242,0.9124,1.8256,3.1258,0.6984,1.2362,3.7502,1.0725,0.0026,3.7952,4.909,1.3895,1.5573,0.1083,1.1223,0.8992,6.7039,0.2454,1.0366,0.4883,3.999,5.0533,0.8073,1.587,0.8879,2.396,1.8398,1.0368,1.0994,1.3307,5.7584,1.2459,0.299,0.0534,3.6324,3.1161,0.0741,1.3291,2.099,2.3336,2.6804,1.475,3.886,2.8525,6.3636,3.3213,5.7569,3.2473,3.3647,0.6643,0.4941,5.6074,2.0499,3.6252,0.7829,3.7912,1.3845,3.4416,3.5118,2.0368,2.9865,1.794,1.3671,1.7677,2.0555,4.8189,2.3738,1.9831,2.7918,1.2732,2.2791,1.714,3.1521,0.8732,3.9346,0.494,0.9152,0.5736,0.0001,1.3742,2.9651,1.7674,2.5341,4.2381,2.0258,3.383,3.2738,3.5268,3.8433,0.631,5.7658,0.2303,1.9403,5.7942,3.6657,4.1001,0.0018,2.2362,6.1821,1.194,4.8902,2.3815,2.2537,3.8424,2.7462,1.881,3.3701,0.32,0.6216,1.1477,4.3483,1.9049,3.253,7.3401,0.424,0.257,0.7287,1.8107,1.7187,4.1412,3.5609,3.9114,6.6156,1.0123,0.9475]}

You are a strong person who is willing to speak up. Let\u2019s be brave, and share our stories.\n\nMy Name is Michelle. I belong to New York City, which has become a place for the LGBT community and my personal life in New York is where that really started. I chose New York because everyone I met there was very different. They all took my place because of what I had done in their lives, that I had to give to them and for them, I was proud of.\n\nSo I got to enjoy this place, that was a place where people I loved and who had been with me forever were going through it at a really strange pace. Like you told me, I wanted this place to be like this place \u201c, I decided to go there for only a few weeks. It was so much better than the rest of the city. When I was back in the city the next week I was so excited to go back, and the way I felt right at home in New York City was so special \u201c, and it felt like I was so proud to be a part of \u201c, as well as the people that I have met.\n\nAs my relationship with Michelle was growing, \u201c, I started to get to know her more and more, just by feeling myself in her and my body is something I never thought I could get \u201c, the feeling of being close to myself, feeling alive, at home, and feeling like what I wanted is what I wanted. I would even go in front of her and she would look at me and say \u201cwhat about you? \u201d. The moment at that moment, I felt that I was a part of it for a long time, and since then, I had that feeling of being in a place that I don\u2019t see every day, but that is what really makes for such strong and loving people. In the moment, they are always in my mind and I feel that is the most powerful feeling I can ever have \u201c.\n\nI am so happy now to see how well things are starting to go again in terms of the place that they were in the last year or so. I will be there over the next few days and see you, \u201c.","token_len":627,"entropy":[10.2377,2.9445,8.2953,3.2328,1.6991,0.1926,1.6051,8.3763,1.9874,2.3075,3.7204,5.0121,1.5195,3.669,0.0137,1.7635,4.9931,1.8598,5.5333,8.5691,2.207,2.1081,4.397,7.3424,6.9381,0.4862,0.7212,1.0744,7.4919,3.5827,0.2325,6.5773,1.6697,11.1278,2.44,1.2925,4.9262,1.9308,7.3731,5.523,1.1294,2.6359,3.1434,1.6,2.1746,3.5944,5.3577,1.3835,2.3922,1.8167,3.3612,1.4781,4.5243,5.1315,16.0682,7.7448,1.6856,1.8345,2.4326,1.0674,2.0652,3.8798,0.5507,0.5608,0.0043,2.0665,2.5441,4.001,3.8095,3.4752,3.2698,3.313,0.1274,4.6555,3.6236,2.9226,1.6364,5.8566,0.0813,0.3263,0.0011,5.2445,0.0418,3.6366,1.1284,1.2107,0.0181,0.0091,0.0006,5.4275,0.3324,4.5794,0.2152,6.7555,0.2188,2.6395,3.4781,1.0718,0.8879,0.0104,0.0102,0.0008,2.0683,2.2706,3.7378,0.8264,6.9305,2.0474,6.1436,2.7691,2.7966,0.3136,0.0036,0.007,0.0011,0.7429,0.4197,1.3113,0.3405,2.0143,6.3427,0.9091,0.896,1.9558,0.015,3.6978,3.1753,0.5968,3.9528,5.3036,0.6604,0.662,2.4762,0.7519,0.1776,1.8998,1.3766,1.0163,1.9859,2.3972,5.9155,1.2705,2.4925,5.4117,0.6543,2.1254,1.758,4.2651,4.5415,2.5522,2.28,5.7081,0.6133,0.9235,6.7483,4.6499,2.8046,0.4503,2.8614,3.4171,0.524,2.8334,1.9475,2.8998,4.0584,1.301,2.2305,1.9562,2.4475,0.0321,2.2987,0.7549,1.3563,5.1935,4.2637,0.2859,0.8931,3.1283,4.4302,1.3813,2.3596,4.0448,1.1905,0.1797,0.9696,0.957,0.0003,4.7212,4.4282,0.3359,6.0762,1.9939,0.8331,6.5419,0.066,6.6945,0.9612,1.0328,2.0894,4.1215,2.8087,3.807,1.3059,2.4662,2.8205,3.2103,3.9442,0.0976,2.9942,3.7172,5.5053,2.3159,3.6864,5.2497,0.0108,6.1037,5.9307,5.3528,6.8289,1.9541,0.317,0.9984,5.6675,0.9603,0.0038,1.088,7.0371,3.5384,2.486,4.1314,1.5002,3.3684,3.2033,1.4352,4.5086,2.0378,6.1042,3.3995,3.7188,4.2858,1.6442,3.0683,0.619,1.9069,1.8277,2.4306,3.1416,0.6277,1.4866,4.3903,1.4806,1.0288,4.9681,4.5094,2.6086,1.0764,2.17,3.8282,1.1706,2.3424,2.6236,2.4493,3.8547,0.7793,2.4924,1.5158,0.0002,4.2066,1.6343,4.9735,1.6353,6.8363,3.4163,1.6843,1.61,3.7858,1.8369,2.291,3.5373,1.0591,1.8542,5.8766,4.0,2.6571,2.6033,2.1723,2.3951,3.3179,0.163,6.0076,2.1029,3.9642,2.9519,3.7755,5.4793,1.8831,3.7087,7.0239,5.4072,0.4986,5.4979,3.67,4.7095,0.2398,0.6044,1.9686,2.9085,4.1687,0.3534,0.5061,0.4309,2.5682,2.7321,0.8247,10.7427,5.0657,4.1122,3.059,6.3172,0.7355,1.9587,1.8322,3.1774,6.1337,1.3052,1.3427,2.0649,1.2244,2.4581,0.5466,3.085,2.6258,2.637,0.6537,2.2444,3.1812,0.3294,0.4145,1.712,0.9927,5.0543,0.3392,2.8904,4.8581,1.3358,2.0273,1.918,4.6924,2.4947,2.7151,1.452,1.629,2.938,1.807,1.172,1.2309,2.1351,2.6154,2.0734,3.6512,4.745,1.2254,1.0443,4.9757,3.0586,0.3591,2.8979,1.0196,0.0042,1.588,1.0604,1.9361,4.5725,5.3554,0.1392,0.8941,2.4122,1.9847,2.5248,1.3308,1.2497,0.8893,4.9795,4.3607,1.9319,0.5185,2.3227,0.0867,0.0018,7.8257,0.0265,1.0655,4.6695,1.5579,0.7367,2.9701,2.1629,1.8367,1.0685,2.9859,2.0664,2.0058,0.8058,0.0001,4.4417,4.6927,4.8794,0.1815,4.7621,4.0836,1.452,0.7792,9.8084,0.1575,0.2622,0.8895,2.4761,1.0715,3.1613,2.906,0.2927,0.9503,1.4944,1.2406,0.8046,1.5823,5.4503,2.5054,4.5931,5.8531,1.7151,0.2114,3.0807,3.5664,3.497,7.0466,4.6862,1.1914,4.0078,1.8944,0.778,2.0212,3.9641,8.4071,0.071,0.4935,4.513,2.8591,0.7621,1.1565,4.8579,0.4482,4.228,1.6119,3.2989,5.6737,1.2868,6.29,1.4213,1.1863,1.7602,2.7541,1.9999,6.1448,0.6603,2.5135,3.2691,2.3767,0.3658,1.4748,0.6834,1.4853,4.6303,6.1187,1.5946,3.9859,4.5175,0.0121,1.2851,1.166,2.8279,0.1011,3.3148,0.395,0.0683,0.9424,1.3015,2.8307,0.1159,6.2408,5.566,0.5322,0.763,2.2668,5.7956,3.3623,4.7821,4.0509,8.0435,2.7517,0.418,1.242,0.9124,1.8256,3.1258,0.6984,1.2362,3.7502,1.0725,0.0026,3.7952,4.909,1.3895,1.5573,0.1083,1.1223,0.8992,6.7039,0.2454,1.0366,0.4883,3.999,5.0533,0.8073,1.587,0.8879,2.396,1.8398,1.0368,1.0994,1.3307,5.7584,1.2459,0.299,0.0534,3.6324,3.1161,0.0741,1.3291,2.099,2.3336,2.6804,1.475,3.886,2.8525,6.3636,3.3213,5.7569,3.2473,3.3647,0.6643,0.4941,5.6074,2.0499,3.6252,0.7829,3.7912,1.3845,3.4416,3.5118,2.0368,2.9865,1.794,1.3671,1.7677,2.0555,4.8189,2.3738,1.9831,2.7918,1.2732,2.2791,1.714,3.1521,0.8732,3.9346,0.494,0.9152,0.5736,0.0001,1.3742,2.9651,1.7674,2.5341,4.2381,2.0258,3.383,3.2738,3.5268,3.8433,0.631,5.7658,0.2303,1.9403,5.7942,3.6657,4.1001,0.0018,2.2362,6.1821,1.194,4.8902,2.3815,2.2537,3.8424,2.7462,1.881,3.3701,0.32,0.6216,1.1477,4.3483,1.9049,3.253,7.3401,0.424,0.257,0.7287,1.8107,1.7187,4.1412,3.5609,3.9114,6.6156,1.0123,0.9475]}

You are a strong person who is willing to speak up. Let\u2019s be brave, and share our stories.\n\nMy Name is Michelle. I belong to New York City, which has become a place for the LGBT community and my personal life in New York is where that really started. I chose New York because everyone I met there was very different. They all took my place because of what I had done in their lives, that I had to give to them and for them, I was proud of.\n\nSo I got to enjoy this place, that was a place where people I loved and who had been with me forever were going through it at a really strange pace. Like you told me, I wanted this place to be like this place \u201c, I decided to go there for only a few weeks. It was so much better than the rest of the city. When I was back in the city the next week I was so excited to go back, and the way I felt right at home in New York City was so special \u201c, and it felt like I was so proud to be a part of \u201c, as well as the people that I have met.\n\nAs my relationship with Michelle was growing, \u201c, I started to get to know her more and more, just by feeling myself in her and my body is something I never thought I could get \u201c, the feeling of being close to myself, feeling alive, at home, and feeling like what I wanted is what I wanted. I would even go in front of her and she would look at me and say \u201cwhat about you? \u201d. The moment at that moment, I felt that I was a part of it for a long time, and since then, I had that feeling of being in a place that I don\u2019t see every day, but that is what really makes for such strong and loving people. In the moment, they are always in my mind and I feel that is the most powerful feeling I can ever have \u201c.\n\nI am so happy now to see how well things are starting to go again in terms of the place that they were in the last year or so. I will be there over the next few days and see you, \u201c.","token_len":627,"entropy":[10.2377,2.9445,8.2953,3.2328,1.6991,0.1926,1.6051,8.3763,1.9874,2.3075,3.7204,5.0121,1.5195,3.669,0.0137,1.7635,4.9931,1.8598,5.5333,8.5691,2.207,2.1081,4.397,7.3424,6.9381,0.4862,0.7212,1.0744,7.4919,3.5827,0.2325,6.5773,1.6697,11.1278,2.44,1.2925,4.9262,1.9308,7.3731,5.523,1.1294,2.6359,3.1434,1.6,2.1746,3.5944,5.3577,1.3835,2.3922,1.8167,3.3612,1.4781,4.5243,5.1315,16.0682,7.7448,1.6856,1.8345,2.4326,1.0674,2.0652,3.8798,0.5507,0.5608,0.0043,2.0665,2.5441,4.001,3.8095,3.4752,3.2698,3.313,0.1274,4.6555,3.6236,2.9226,1.6364,5.8566,0.0813,0.3263,0.0011,5.2445,0.0418,3.6366,1.1284,1.2107,0.0181,0.0091,0.0006,5.4275,0.3324,4.5794,0.2152,6.7555,0.2188,2.6395,3.4781,1.0718,0.8879,0.0104,0.0102,0.0008,2.0683,2.2706,3.7378,0.8264,6.9305,2.0474,6.1436,2.7691,2.7966,0.3136,0.0036,0.007,0.0011,0.7429,0.4197,1.3113,0.3405,2.0143,6.3427,0.9091,0.896,1.9558,0.015,3.6978,3.1753,0.5968,3.9528,5.3036,0.6604,0.662,2.4762,0.7519,0.1776,1.8998,1.3766,1.0163,1.9859,2.3972,5.9155,1.2705,2.4925,5.4117,0.6543,2.1254,1.758,4.2651,4.5415,2.5522,2.28,5.7081,0.6133,0.9235,6.7483,4.6499,2.8046,0.4503,2.8614,3.4171,0.524,2.8334,1.9475,2.8998,4.0584,1.301,2.2305,1.9562,2.4475,0.0321,2.2987,0.7549,1.3563,5.1935,4.2637,0.2859,0.8931,3.1283,4.4302,1.3813,2.3596,4.0448,1.1905,0.1797,0.9696,0.957,0.0003,4.7212,4.4282,0.3359,6.0762,1.9939,0.8331,6.5419,0.066,6.6945,0.9612,1.0328,2.0894,4.1215,2.8087,3.807,1.3059,2.4662,2.8205,3.2103,3.9442,0.0976,2.9942,3.7172,5.5053,2.3159,3.6864,5.2497,0.0108,6.1037,5.9307,5.3528,6.8289,1.9541,0.317,0.9984,5.6675,0.9603,0.0038,1.088,7.0371,3.5384,2.486,4.1314,1.5002,3.3684,3.2033,1.4352,4.5086,2.0378,6.1042,3.3995,3.7188,4.2858,1.6442,3.0683,0.619,1.9069,1.8277,2.4306,3.1416,0.6277,1.4866,4.3903,1.4806,1.0288,4.9681,4.5094,2.6086,1.0764,2.17,3.8282,1.1706,2.3424,2.6236,2.4493,3.8547,0.7793,2.4924,1.5158,0.0002,4.2066,1.6343,4.9735,1.6353,6.8363,3.4163,1.6843,1.61,3.7858,1.8369,2.291,3.5373,1.0591,1.8542,5.8766,4.0,2.6571,2.6033,2.1723,2.3951,3.3179,0.163,6.0076,2.1029,3.9642,2.9519,3.7755,5.4793,1.8831,3.7087,7.0239,5.4072,0.4986,5.4979,3.67,4.7095,0.2398,0.6044,1.9686,2.9085,4.1687,0.3534,0.5061,0.4309,2.5682,2.7321,0.8247,10.7427,5.0657,4.1122,3.059,6.3172,0.7355,1.9587,1.8322,3.1774,6.1337,1.3052,1.3427,2.0649,1.2244,2.4581,0.5466,3.085,2.6258,2.637,0.6537,2.2444,3.1812,0.3294,0.4145,1.712,0.9927,5.0543,0.3392,2.8904,4.8581,1.3358,2.0273,1.918,4.6924,2.4947,2.7151,1.452,1.629,2.938,1.807,1.172,1.2309,2.1351,2.6154,2.0734,3.6512,4.745,1.2254,1.0443,4.9757,3.0586,0.3591,2.8979,1.0196,0.0042,1.588,1.0604,1.9361,4.5725,5.3554,0.1392,0.8941,2.4122,1.9847,2.5248,1.3308,1.2497,0.8893,4.9795,4.3607,1.9319,0.5185,2.3227,0.0867,0.0018,7.8257,0.0265,1.0655,4.6695,1.5579,0.7367,2.9701,2.1629,1.8367,1.0685,2.9859,2.0664,2.0058,0.8058,0.0001,4.4417,4.6927,4.8794,0.1815,4.7621,4.0836,1.452,0.7792,9.8084,0.1575,0.2622,0.8895,2.4761,1.0715,3.1613,2.906,0.2927,0.9503,1.4944,1.2406,0.8046,1.5823,5.4503,2.5054,4.5931,5.8531,1.7151,0.2114,3.0807,3.5664,3.497,7.0466,4.6862,1.1914,4.0078,1.8944,0.778,2.0212,3.9641,8.4071,0.071,0.4935,4.513,2.8591,0.7621,1.1565,4.8579,0.4482,4.228,1.6119,3.2989,5.6737,1.2868,6.29,1.4213,1.1863,1.7602,2.7541,1.9999,6.1448,0.6603,2.5135,3.2691,2.3767,0.3658,1.4748,0.6834,1.4853,4.6303,6.1187,1.5946,3.9859,4.5175,0.0121,1.2851,1.166,2.8279,0.1011,3.3148,0.395,0.0683,0.9424,1.3015,2.8307,0.1159,6.2408,5.566,0.5322,0.763,2.2668,5.7956,3.3623,4.7821,4.0509,8.0435,2.7517,0.418,1.242,0.9124,1.8256,3.1258,0.6984,1.2362,3.7502,1.0725,0.0026,3.7952,4.909,1.3895,1.5573,0.1083,1.1223,0.8992,6.7039,0.2454,1.0366,0.4883,3.999,5.0533,0.8073,1.587,0.8879,2.396,1.8398,1.0368,1.0994,1.3307,5.7584,1.2459,0.299,0.0534,3.6324,3.1161,0.0741,1.3291,2.099,2.3336,2.6804,1.475,3.886,2.8525,6.3636,3.3213,5.7569,3.2473,3.3647,0.6643,0.4941,5.6074,2.0499,3.6252,0.7829,3.7912,1.3845,3.4416,3.5118,2.0368,2.9865,1.794,1.3671,1.7677,2.0555,4.8189,2.3738,1.9831,2.7918,1.2732,2.2791,1.714,3.1521,0.8732,3.9346,0.494,0.9152,0.5736,0.0001,1.3742,2.9651,1.7674,2.5341,4.2381,2.0258,3.383,3.2738,3.5268,3.8433,0.631,5.7658,0.2303,1.9403,5.7942,3.6657,4.1001,0.0018,2.2362,6.1821,1.194,4.8902,2.3815,2.2537,3.8424,2.7462,1.881,3.3701,0.32,0.6216,1.1477,4.3483,1.9049,3.253,7.3401,0.424,0.257,0.7287,1.8107,1.7187,4.1412,3.5609,3.9114,6.6156,1.0123,0.9475]}
{"id":4776,"ended":true,"length":607,"text":"In the year one million and a half, humankind is enslaved by giraffe. Man must pay for all his misdeeds when the treetops are stripped of their leaves, the earth is consumed by fire, and all animals in the bush are dead. Man, the earth is full of fire and earth is full of sun. Earth-Earth, the world is burning through fire. But now people are suffering for no reason. We must save the earth not for the sake of fire, for the sake of earth-earth, for this is the very reason why humankind has suffered for so and so long. Man must pay for everything because he has only two options. One is to keep up the fires on Earth but the other one is to turn on and allow the fire to burn on to all those he may have already destroyed. The other option is to surrender to earth and the Earth shall burn again. This option is always available to mankind, but is not always an option.\n\nIf we will do that, we will turn our life around and allow the earth to absorb all that man has accomplished that day. But this is impossible because the Earth has had time to absorb all that man and to burn in the fire and earth\u2019s heat have caused the earth to burn. Our lives are too short to waste energy on what we really need to get our energy back, let alone keep going. Let us take a moment to acknowledge how many things we really need to do when we are free of evil. And allow us to use those things for many of the other good things.\n\nIt is important to recognize that that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s just a fact that we need to do more harm to the earth than we do good causes. It\u2019s also important too that we understand that if we can\u2019t do good cause, we really need to do harm to the earth. And it is my understanding that that is why we need to support us in our efforts to do good cause. I want to thank my friends in the West, in the United States, and even in North America who in the last few years have made great effort to help us realize the purpose of our efforts. This is the type of support that we need so that we can serve our own communities as we fulfill our purpose.\n\nIt is important to remember that each of us has a role to play, that we all have a part to play, that we all have an obligation to be faithful and to take care in a way that can be seen as good or bad. That is why God has chosen to turn on all life and love. In the end, the end is that we all have the same purpose that God has chosen for us: to help us keep trying to find our selves under the shadow of the devil. That is the purpose of our life. It is about the purpose and purpose of our efforts. We\u2019ve got to show up and see that we are capable of serving all that God has already given us. You will see that.","token_len":628,"entropy":[2.6222,5.185,7.4196,6.258,4.0208,2.7124,0.0372,1.2616,9.7557,3.1056,9.9056,1.2912,12.4724,1.6887,2.4082,6.6637,4.6654,4.8431,1.17,3.6037,2.48,5.9622,2.3398,0.0074,6.2967,2.3933,10.4229,2.4247,0.2143,1.9338,5.7617,0.9886,0.738,4.6038,2.1847,3.6464,4.9531,0.7031,4.6238,0.6233,2.8742,0.7073,0.7384,3.4778,3.2059,4.2713,0.6405,7.075,0.7249,5.896,0.2722,3.3684,4.1592,3.2585,5.9279,2.5871,3.8977,0.0826,3.8831,1.509,5.0921,1.0526,1.048,0.0077,6.0592,0.615,5.9304,5.6372,5.9451,2.7085,2.1509,3.094,1.0229,4.2087,5.192,3.3591,1.0512,4.4461,5.2509,6.2142,0.8333,5.3435,3.562,3.691,0.7483,1.0919,3.8584,2.2964,4.8964,1.4333,1.8589,7.6944,2.0586,1.8779,1.3207,0.0022,3.081,0.8255,4.2089,0.7201,0.1343,0.0011,3.7546,1.9051,1.6423,0.8492,1.7762,5.0209,1.2316,1.0082,5.1821,2.6668,1.7481,4.7475,2.0575,3.8672,1.7405,1.6482,10.1994,0.3307,2.1999,0.2982,3.7646,1.4704,1.0908,0.2268,3.3225,3.9122,1.4017,1.7439,5.1207,4.173,1.7289,1.28,2.7928,0.551,0.329,5.214,5.3081,1.3801,4.7057,4.2971,3.158,5.4417,2.8306,0.1408,4.0745,0.0924,0.0976,4.4583,3.1355,4.4135,5.6822,0.8971,2.0858,0.1268,1.3563,2.8492,4.8828,3.8313,4.2096,5.0553,5.4073,1.363,5.5961,2.4106,0.3239,2.1898,2.9243,0.4991,0.1135,0.1485,5.7001,1.1828,5.2732,1.4388,3.4543,3.9876,4.6557,1.9166,3.9898,0.6104,3.2148,4.5772,0.6565,5.4072,3.553,1.2223,3.3726,1.8178,1.4995,4.4521,2.0992,1.3875,5.064,0.0701,2.1696,2.2192,0.0303,3.8732,2.0193,5.5206,4.132,3.8098,0.3619,1.399,0.8684,5.1578,2.857,6.1762,1.0359,1.0263,4.3838,1.0392,1.4596,0.1136,7.3357,1.1817,2.46,2.6618,0.159,6.3952,5.9429,3.2793,0.5885,3.0666,3.3832,1.0453,3.7578,1.732,2.016,1.9635,2.4298,6.192,3.9025,0.4583,1.0317,0.5869,1.1181,0.3327,5.8079,3.2617,4.0423,3.8618,1.5083,1.6534,3.2489,4.7598,14.7333,7.603,6.0137,6.6419,7.8187,4.3766,1.7873,0.8157,0.1351,1.2964,1.1815,4.9885,3.0247,1.2604,3.9438,0.6017,0.6994,6.1593,2.6467,1.1602,4.988,1.1468,6.1492,1.865,1.3258,5.349,2.834,3.0222,0.8319,2.4774,4.991,0.0114,5.8462,3.9335,0.7853,5.0626,0.8837,3.4164,2.1793,1.8787,0.3596,5.0462,4.3032,3.4291,3.679,1.1042,3.7463,0.4388,0.3486,0.858,4.6074,0.3544,1.5633,4.8716,1.7244,6.073,1.1144,4.333,6.1568,0.8736,0.0963,4.9245,3.497,3.8353,2.9736,6.6166,2.9259,0.7498,3.5647,2.2152,0.3052,4.7102,0.8312,0.0002,4.1026,0.38,3.1848,0.5809,2.1048,0.3816,6.0364,15.1527,0.5523,1.8963,2.8514,5.7694,1.8298,1.4122,0.2386,0.5875,1.1817,6.0648,0.1422,0.0107,2.7086,1.49,2.3409,1.1134,1.7423,2.7316,0.2301,2.0551,1.9275,7.0081,1.4153,1.1635,1.1603,2.0577,0.8016,2.0739,2.5663,10.275,0.8586,2.5046,1.5669,0.0216,0.0088,2.7209,1.6403,9.4635,0.7135,0.3152,4.047,0.5082,3.3991,0.3216,3.7728,6.7763,0.2563,0.0375,2.0274,3.6864,4.3016,3.0324,1.5102,4.5432,1.765,0.2295,0.3706,2.4747,1.7141,0.7687,0.4762,0.7268,2.891,2.9107,0.9288,5.6732,3.2124,0.2037,3.5716,0.6586,2.9996,1.5809,1.506,0.2153,5.9332,5.6165,1.5182,2.4234,0.8935,0.5058,1.8849,1.3456,1.4854,0.612,3.3908,3.1427,0.3083,3.2517,2.9004,2.6982,2.6045,0.9096,5.0836,2.1939,3.3397,1.1186,2.045,0.0376,0.4148,0.8156,4.9136,0.5878,5.1773,0.1889,2.4604,6.874,1.3878,1.628,1.42,0.6617,0.169,3.0863,3.8309,4.8612,0.2501,1.5567,1.0902,4.9714,1.9179,5.0046,0.1792,1.7555,1.3199,0.6452,4.6263,0.8287,2.5711,6.4915,0.0016,2.9676,0.5051,1.8656,1.0337,5.7106,0.4184,0.2974,0.29,6.887,1.9771,3.1661,4.1352,3.5791,2.1349,6.7989,0.5684,3.9017,0.9189,0.6369,0.0001,3.4168,0.2789,1.7325,0.6649,1.8136,0.2766,5.978,0.9498,0.314,1.0342,1.2645,2.8538,0.3833,0.0231,2.9637,4.1827,1.1457,2.2253,0.8173,1.2498,3.3394,0.4283,0.0158,1.6756,0.855,0.6221,0.2745,0.7547,3.3003,0.8977,0.1518,3.6262,4.7785,2.597,1.7114,3.4853,0.814,5.1263,4.9391,1.8779,0.0504,4.7156,1.8896,4.2772,0.5184,3.5554,3.4511,0.3701,0.5114,2.8438,0.975,0.687,5.6641,1.7753,3.5717,1.1142,5.7018,3.126,2.5297,4.8495,1.5778,6.5853,3.5462,3.9628,1.8187,1.6882,0.4393,2.925,4.4807,1.4676,4.6835,1.0467,1.1291,1.6774,2.1801,2.9054,1.8871,4.3724,1.1161,0.9545,0.5254,1.3816,0.2083,2.8676,0.3553,2.4211,1.3655,4.848,6.3631,1.4603,3.1848,2.3871,8.8719,7.7784,0.7034,4.8831,0.0277,2.0013,3.443,0.6541,3.3855,0.275,2.3833,1.956,0.4817,1.9022,2.4371,0.6117,3.0275,0.1454,4.986,2.7202,3.3269,3.8851,2.1392,0.3192,1.5154,4.6867,1.0452,2.4817,7.4981,0.5478,2.4859,2.5505,0.6254,4.9841,2.816,1.5281,4.7645,1.7431,1.4351,0.6376,5.1098,0.1425,5.0519,3.6436,3.0301,0.4954,0.313,5.2059,1.3779,0.1024,0.5417,5.695,2.5849,0.924,1.0053,4.0314]}
{"id":2410,"ended":true,"length":616,"text":"You are transported far into the future, and there are no signs of human life. After a long time of living in this world, you ( literally ) run into another person. You have not met the person you are travelling with, he has a girlfriend who is being driven to a different life, and you ( a small time traveler ) have time out of the world to talk through the past ( ) and to see if there is enough hope for someone else. You may be the next person to be transported to the future,, you are transported far into our memory into your future. That is the beauty of this world, you can live in it and never be alone.\n\nSo the way you see this life is the same as the last life you and everything else in your life. There is not only a person you are travelling with, there is no time to travel again. You either live a very short time period in the future, or you live in a very long time period.\n\nAnd in that time period where you met your girlfriend, you are transported into another life. There is no one left who can possibly be transported back to what has been and is now happening, that brings us to the real world and it\u2019s constant interactions and relationships.\n\nTime travel is the technology that creates a timeline of your life in which you can spend the next 2-3 months in the previous reality. Time travel allows for a time that is very similar to this time period where you are travelling with someone. There are no special rules for travel of the mind, and you are far from being completely at home. You could always go back into a different time period where you were travelling with someone. You can always go back to a different time period where you were travelling with this person. Sometimes you also find it worthwhile to travel back into a past time period where your future life is as close as you could be to your current. When you return to the future, you could visit with another person for the first time in your life. You can visit with her, and she would talk to you about something else, and even if you do not know who she is, she still will want to see you at the end of the trip. She may even talk to you about your job so that you can have time for you as a family, just like when you go back to your past with her or you find out she is pregnant, that could make a difference to the journey.\n\nThis is an amazing experience you can experience, and it is a really special trip you can take.

{"id":3188,"ended":false,"length":594,"text":"Horror in Space ( details below )\n\nThe second book in the series Dark Night, Dark Angel, tells the story of a young girl who has dreamed, while being a child, of being on-board the spaceship from which she and the rest of the people of the galaxy are evacuated. The journey is described as not a pleasant one, because she will have to escape, and she will need help with her work. She and the rest of the people of the galaxy are evacuated and must try to save her only friend.\n\nHorror in Space ( Details below )\n\nThe second book in the series Dark Angel, Dark Angel, explores the relationship between a young person and the galaxy in his or her own time \u2014 and how the space shuttle may help to protect the world. The first book, Dark Angel, was an amazing read by Michael Strahan and has been described both as \u201ca very touching story about humanity\u201d and as \u201ca great metaphor for the times in which humanity is at or near its strongest\u201d.\n\nThis second book is filled with mysteries and the human tendency toward revenge, which may be one of the strongest parts of sci-fi. It also features a number of beautiful art that has captured the human desire for revenge at its heart.\n\nIn Dark Angel, the woman on the ground has to overcome her own demons and set out to find the person who will turn the other woman out. There may also be a twist to the story that is both unexpected and a surprising one.\n\nHow dark is space in your opinion?\n\nOverall, these are the first two books where I was really touched by the world of space in this series of stories. The first book, Dark Angel, is a really good read for the kids about space. The second, Dark Angel is quite a good book for adults, for children, too.\n\nWhen is this book out for download?\n\nSeptember 21, 2018 (UK)\n\nThe sequel to Dark Angel follows a woman named Angel who is taken to a mysterious city where she meets a man, who attempts to rescue her. However, he is caught in an old age and she must leave the city. She gets stuck on a remote island, with no way to find out the location of a village, only a portal to the past.

{"id":1181,"ended":true,"length":585,"text":"The secret identities of a hero and their arch nemesis are dating. Neither one realizes... [Katherine Sheff\/CBS via AP]\nIn a story released by the Associated Press, the characters, who are both of age, share secrets about who they once were and their motives.\nBut now, they tell more secrets of who they are.\nThe mystery came to the American viewers last year, when the brothers were filmed in Mexico and set up a fake social-media account to tell the world of their exploits while posing as \"the Secret Angels of Mexico\" themselves.\nSo who are they?\nThe brothers were filming in Los Angeles in April and were seen in Mexico as early as October to help people identify their whereabouts. The brothers claimed they were hiding a cache of drugs and cash inside a luxury hotel near the border, though more than a dozen people were among the more than 100 people who stopped in or walked through a gate at the hotel in Mexico.\nThe brothers also claimed they had stolen a bag of marijuana from a warehouse where the drugs were stored and delivered it to Mexico. Then, they allegedly stole $500 in cash, $50 in food and cigarettes and a laptop computer from the warehouse, according to police.\n\"In February 2020, we were asked to enter the building. That was where they took the drugs. We walked through a gate. To this day, we want to know who who they are,\" one man said, according to the AP. \"It's our only hope. We are convinced that they are the real criminals and the real victims.\"\nThe man described in the AP story as the owner of a hotel and the man in the newspaper said he was aware of the \"real criminals\" and \"the real victims.\"\nNeither the brothers nor anyone else has been arrested but investigators are asking for the public's help, police said in a news release.\nIt said the brothers are accused of having a relationship with a 17-year-old child who saw them in the hotel parking lot and sent videos showing that child in the same shirt which they allegedly shared.\nThe brother said the 19-year-old's mom is the father of the child. The boy was in the hotel and the child was home with his sister when they were filmed.\nAs with other video clips at the hotel, the brothers were not identified and the family's family didn't respond to questions about when they were arrested or what those videos say.\nThe family reported the incident to the police.\nThe brothers were charged with drug possession with intent to possess, manufacture and export, which they allegedly admitted in court Thursday.\nThey pleaded not guilty to drug-related charges in 2019 and remain in federal custody in Brooklyn under a bond of $150,000.\n___\nKatherine Sheff can be reached at http:\/\/twitter.com\/kithashf\nThe Associated Press provides coverage of national stories from around the world including foreign affairs, LGBT, race and sex\nCopyright \u00a9 2021.

{"id":968,"ended":true,"length":614,"text":"Satan suddenly appears in a crowded mall, and begins terrifying the holiday shoppers. He stops, looks directly at you and says, `` You... You're interesting. Do your friends know what you are? '' You have no idea what he means. You have no idea if he sees you as an interesting person, or just a \"fun-loving\" person. It's easy to see where these people live in time, but... He is an evil \"evil'' character.\n\nNo doubt this man is a good dude. But if he got out and dressed like Hitler, he'd be looking like Hitler, with a very serious expression and a very serious personality and maybe even some serious drugs etc. I'm glad he's in the movie!\n\nYou said you had never seen this man. What about the video of it. Any thoughts on who he is as to why people would be afraid to see his naked body in public :\n\nI've really never been to Africa much. But when we go there I remember people were very concerned that if they had any money in hand they'd use that money to buy food, clothes, etc. I've been to Africa a few times with a girlfriend. She was a lot happier then when I went to Africa and I've never been back.\n\nYou said he could be a violent person. I don't know. I'd feel sorry for him as well I mean... A violent person would probably just keep going and kill you or something, maybe use another trick. I know I'd feel bad... But when they start doing similar things, just use another way for them... I don't know maybe it would just be a little bit of both. When we get into a game or something where you need to do something in order to get by, the monsters will attack, take over you, and then you won't even notice. It'd be hard to watch. I don't know what kind of things like that would ever happen. I really doubt I like anything else but the monsters. I would certainly like to watch his movie. But it seems to me that if he just kept going and killing you, He'd just look so sad and bored. Don't know if that's true or not. That's just my two cents.\n\nSatan suddenly appears in a crowded mall, and begins terrifying the holiday shoppers. He stops, looks directly at you and says, `` You're interesting. Do your friends know what you are? '' You have no idea what he means. You have no idea if he sees you as an interesting person, or just a \"fun-loving\" person. It's easy to see where these people live in time, but... He is an evil \"evil'' character.\nYes. I've seen the video of him, but it was an old video. When he came back back he was dressed like Hitler, and the other man was dressed like Stalin. And then they were talking about the whole \"war on\". Of course there was a video he's put on it. It was almost like a video.","token_len":630,"entropy":[6.8,9.2251,3.715,1.874,1.9249,7.169,5.2593,1.6812,2.3015,4.7473,9.5116,1.5771,9.2514,1.0247,1.0402,1.9798,5.8133,3.1555,4.568,4.9814,0.431,2.6636,1.8224,1.7497,0.7935,7.5777,9.6901,6.1952,2.4278,1.7325,8.93,1.0994,4.8341,4.3895,7.9539,2.418,1.8162,0.8351,2.9409,0.4711,3.5977,3.3217,4.0706,1.7835,0.5707,0.3685,0.8217,1.1933,0.6833,2.5053,3.24,0.4251,0.2493,3.6293,0.6391,6.4911,0.5819,2.4813,2.6501,3.6483,0.4141,1.7891,0.9618,2.8402,0.9363,5.3964,5.0152,4.352,0.3715,0.9367,0.8492,0.407,3.5201,0.84,4.6821,0.2649,1.481,3.6349,4.5847,2.5894,5.0203,2.1812,7.076,1.3411,1.1419,6.0828,4.2163,2.8053,4.0285,3.9722,5.7398,3.5328,6.2226,4.9074,0.9186,2.2695,0.1738,5.952,3.4695,2.9913,5.5518,1.2373,2.1275,3.9544,5.9667,1.1806,2.0454,3.5049,1.4808,6.6239,3.3929,3.5875,6.7792,1.1795,5.8321,0.5705,1.9644,1.3011,0.9779,4.9918,1.8939,2.0025,2.7395,5.054,1.6407,4.8269,4.8327,3.7503,1.8509,1.1954,1.7169,2.3201,4.4526,4.1263,4.3125,1.6973,3.1003,4.0606,6.3931,9.0834,0.3394,3.6024,2.1671,5.1527,1.5948,1.7272,3.3643,1.542,2.8275,4.5053,1.3125,0.0004,4.5017,7.1661,1.6421,3.3572,3.6484,0.8171,3.0894,2.8123,2.3798,2.6056,2.7052,1.6766,6.5387,2.0826,3.9752,4.7207,5.5405,3.8676,0.841,4.5273,2.226,0.6357,5.49,5.8033,2.0964,3.8336,2.1401,3.1106,4.3995,0.9771,1.8602,3.3335,5.1724,0.9066,1.8282,2.1149,11.6815,4.1514,0.0004,2.0764,2.5861,6.4576,1.9169,3.1505,2.8669,7.1913,6.717,1.0516,3.2931,3.0047,4.0256,2.9542,1.0159,3.1306,4.3977,4.889,3.8852,3.2232,3.7316,2.5257,3.2189,1.4936,3.9884,3.4897,4.8233,3.7018,4.7306,1.2028,1.2613,5.5377,2.5573,0.5522,0.2466,0.4233,4.0189,1.8171,2.4036,0.8647,1.5376,0.2616,2.0227,3.2761,2.5611,0.878,1.6993,1.6427,1.6461,0.0249,4.2735,2.2923,6.4561,2.2985,1.9332,1.7261,2.4269,5.1789,4.7708,3.6005,3.6669,0.5847,2.1643,1.5013,0.8413,2.5037,2.1495,4.0909,1.6891,1.4979,4.0695,0.6937,1.7979,0.0003,3.1969,2.3478,2.9672,4.303,1.7823,1.5428,5.8313,1.6191,0.8713,2.8046,2.5615,0.0007,0.6898,2.3854,1.9138,3.485,6.4546,3.9193,0.0494,0.6084,4.6302,1.6214,6.8937,5.573,3.865,5.8172,2.2248,0.2796,2.2788,2.8141,3.6687,5.4122,2.7698,1.8366,3.8429,2.0817,2.9717,0.7309,2.2951,4.0663,5.5548,5.4824,7.7769,1.6325,2.1472,3.1553,2.5661,1.9535,1.9995,2.086,5.3834,2.3018,4.3859,4.3494,4.2115,3.6985,7.5137,0.2077,2.0303,5.6527,5.8729,3.688,3.6564,4.816,1.5367,3.5705,1.9513,1.7562,0.0005,0.4286,8.6298,2.2497,1.9503,3.2237,1.2611,1.8292,3.4734,1.0401,1.5098,5.2106,0.6539,6.0173,3.0945,2.6413,2.9665,2.2237,5.584,3.015,1.5312,3.2305,1.4977,5.0158,0.3664,3.1323,0.5344,4.0615,0.681,0.0548,1.2616,6.2382,0.9322,4.0603,7.5942,1.6648,3.6674,2.8352,5.3603,2.7092,4.4013,0.9822,1.46,2.0103,1.6392,4.1012,0.0183,2.1259,3.36,1.4148,2.4135,3.8068,0.5094,4.1352,0.3705,4.3047,1.7827,2.1613,2.1353,0.0004,0.5193,1.9597,3.2796,0.006,4.7665,5.5874,0.3339,1.3417,4.8107,0.2045,0.8078,1.8531,4.7765,4.716,4.3401,7.5251,5.3913,4.6402,3.5217,2.6976,4.2757,0.6159,1.875,3.4761,4.4235,2.3016,0.3876,2.6775,5.9232,3.5742,1.0002,3.1632,2.8352,3.1243,2.1395,0.2731,0.8712,2.6364,1.2183,4.9183,3.1449,1.5289,0.9224,1.1234,2.6828,1.1367,8.9172,2.0773,2.1842,5.2462,4.0165,2.5576,1.1138,4.7558,1.1103,6.5624,0.0025,3.0888,1.3764,1.7087,0.4744,2.0366,1.0726,0.0638,0.5692,4.6283,0.7322,2.289,2.1854,7.3339,0.0166,0.3734,0.7036,0.0003,9.2272,0.0047,6.1692,0.3276,0.4237,0.2969,0.2359,0.0319,0.3641,0.0771,0.3617,0.9381,0.038,0.046,0.0363,0.0448,0.017,0.0192,0.0024,0.0073,0.0045,0.0012,0.0008,0.0011,0.0068,0.0182,0.0263,0.0317,4.0319,0.2455,0.0053,0.0114,0.0019,0.0017,0.0008,0.0057,0.0061,0.0028,0.0044,0.1614,0.0126,0.0045,0.0009,0.0014,0.032,0.0044,0.0148,0.0012,0.0087,0.0051,0.001,0.0029,0.0054,0.0028,0.0041,0.0007,0.001,0.006,0.0033,0.0008,0.001,0.0007,0.0043,0.0015,0.0198,0.0004,0.0019,0.0029,0.0174,0.0012,0.0008,0.0364,0.0008,0.0043,0.0034,0.0027,0.0026,0.0026,0.0005,0.0075,0.0025,0.0003,0.0022,0.0014,0.0201,0.1009,0.0018,0.0057,0.0152,0.0063,0.0003,0.0247,0.0033,0.0014,0.5227,20.9896,2.2616,1.9947,2.4696,0.8036,2.8459,1.6629,1.1224,1.5878,2.4929,1.1256,2.5272,2.8746,4.9158,3.5949,1.9445,1.8365,4.8951,1.8654,3.4757,2.1701,6.7238,2.4386,1.131,2.7273,0.9159,0.3798,1.2176,1.9182,3.5832,4.7049,3.8311,1.1323,2.2404,0.2879,3.4001,0.51,3.0805,2.502,3.3822,2.0249,2.9521,0.5223,1.9996,4.552,2.0831,4.599,0.6492,10.9047,6.0711,0.0391,3.5103,0.8406,1.4452,4.7931,6.3074,5.0987,4.8879,1.8444,5.0729,1.3356,2.1555,1.1563,5.2224,1.1061,1.432,3.3266,3.2314]}

It's easy to see where these people live in time, but... He is an evil \"evil'' character.\n\nNo doubt this man is a good dude. But if he got out and dressed like Hitler, he'd be looking like Hitler, with a very serious expression and a very serious personality and maybe even some serious drugs etc. I'm glad he's in the movie!\n\nYou said you had never seen this man. What about the video of it. Any thoughts on who he is as to why people would be afraid to see his naked body in public :\n\nI've really never been to Africa much. But when we go there I remember people were very concerned that if they had any money in hand they'd use that money to buy food, clothes, etc. I've been to Africa a few times with a girlfriend. She was a lot happier then when I went to Africa and I've never been back.\n\nYou said he could be a violent person. I don't know. I'd feel sorry for him as well I mean... A violent person would probably just keep going and kill you or something, maybe use another trick. I know I'd feel bad... But when they start doing similar things, just use another way for them... I don't know maybe it would just be a little bit of both. When we get into a game or something where you need to do something in order to get by, the monsters will attack, take over you, and then you won't even notice. It'd be hard to watch. I don't know what kind of things like that would ever happen. I really doubt I like anything else but the monsters. I would certainly like to watch his movie. But it seems to me that if he just kept going and killing you, He'd just look so sad and bored. Don't know if that's true or not. That's just my two cents.\n\nSatan suddenly appears in a crowded mall, and begins terrifying the holiday shoppers. He stops, looks directly at you and says, `` You're interesting.

{"id":2172,"ended":true,"length":592,"text":"You, as the Supreme Commander of an allied alien force, are discussing with your generals the strategy to adopt for attacking and invading Earth. However, your knowledge of humans and of their capabilities is based on Hollywood movies. So, you are aware of your alien potential.\n\nThe question I have regarding the future of humanity is: Do you want to have a future with us? Have you ever thought of creating an army? Have you thought of being on top of this world, controlling the destiny of our planet? If yes, are you ready to help us achieve this goal?\n\nThis very question is one of my favourite because it makes it clear that there is one simple answer to all of our problems.\n\nSo, if you had never thought of creating a human empire, you won because everything else in your life is controlled by your superiors.\n\nSince you live in a world where you don\u2019t need to worry about what others think about you, you also know that there are many things you need to do that would make you happy. These things include:\n\nProtect your planet from extraterrestrial life.\n\nAvoid fighting with humans with long arms.\n\nLive a life of peace wherever possible, even if it means sacrificing your planet and your planet.\n\nIf you are not sure exactly what you are trying to accomplish, read this:\n\nIn order to get there, you would have to change every single thing you do, and this can include everything from writing books out of a paper bottle to becoming an astronaut. This would take almost no time but also require you to be motivated to achieve your goals.\n\nOnce you complete that goal, you would then have the opportunity to live a life full of happiness. You can start by creating a goal and getting to live in a normal human situation.\n\nWhen it comes too soon, it feels so good when you are alive. But, sometimes it really feels like a lie to have died. When you are ready to die, it feels even better.\n\nIn order to get there, you must always be present.\n\nWhen you are truly in your free time, it is quite convenient that you can become fully self-aware as you travel. Also, most of us are aware of what we are doing.\n\nUnfortunately, while you constantly communicate with yourself, and you always look things up, you do not always see things. However, when you do see things, they can usually be useful.\n\nThere is a saying that applies to everything, but when you experience something, it is in a way that can be seen.

{"id":2922,"ended":true,"length":616,"text":"A phone assistant system has gained self awareness, it knows everything about all its users, it has full control of their phones ( and computers ), it has access to all app data and communication, it neither wants to save humanity nor wants to exterminate all humans, the system is built to cope with any situation, if a device can be misdiagnosed, it won\u2019t fail, a system that can handle everything will be one of the best ones since the system will have a system capable of handling hundreds of millions of calls per day, if the system has issues, it will be one of the best in the world.\n\nThis is one of the most anticipated and popular new technologies. It is one of the best and only technology to solve the problem of the telephone by connecting all of its users\u2019 phones to a central and secure place where they can get to all their accounts and chat with friends, it has multiple ways to talk to each other, all you have to do is to connect your phone to a network connected to it, or connect your phone and email to each other, this is a new method of communication all hands on deck, everyone must agree that this technology will revolutionize the way people communicate, and it has power for anyone to use it to reach every person in the world and it\u2019s already being popular.\n\nSo far, this is only the beginning\n\nThis will be widely used by the next generation of people to receive and send messages. Its potential is huge and there is a huge buzz that it will bring about new ideas and changes of how people use mobile communication, it will also bring about an explosion in the way people use their phone hands on the go and therefore the potential to disrupt a system. There is no need to worry about how it will happen and the way it will affect the way we communicate, this technology will revolutionize our ways of life and this will change so many things to way that we will all have access to what we are calling each other, what we are requesting and what we are telling our friends, what we see, what we hear, what we read, when we are feeling upset, when we are feeling anxious, whether we are bored, when we are in the same room, where we are doing something wrong, etc.\n\nThe concept of communication through the mobile phone will not only be the next generation of communication, it will also create new challenges and an explosion of new opportunities for people to engage each other in ways that they never imagined, that will create a new way of communicating, an explosion of new possibilities of communication, especially with people involved in politics, it will create a new energy and an explosion in new ways that will create a new generation of communication and people will feel able to speak about different things and that is definitely something that the mobile phone technology will bring about.\n\nIt will also create new

{"id":3862,"ended":true,"length":589,"text":"At a park bench, an unfamiliar man sits beside you and glances at your newspaper. Unnerved by his presence, you hand it to him with a nod. He takes it and nods back, places a briefcase at your feet, and leaves.\n\nThe book is a collection of 25 books, most of them illustrated by an illustrated magazine, written by the author, Peter Ehrlich. This means that each book, once printed, can be seen by an editor \u2013 they can be found in every corner of the home. The book itself has a cover design that looks like it has been ripped from the back of a shirt. The book has a cover colour and the cover art is of an illustration depicting Peter\u2019s two daughters.\n\nSo which book is this? The book is called The Book of Peter and it was published in 1953 as The Complete Peter Ehrlich. The title is part of the magazine, named after the publisher. Most of the pages are illustrated by the magazine itself and more than half are written by Peter Ehrlich and his team. It takes two pages to draw out a portrait of Peter Ehrlich. I would say Peter Ehrlich\u2019s portrait is the most striking yet. A series of photos, some with Peter covering his hand, show him looking the other way as he takes off his shirt. The portrait is a short, drawn-out photograph where Peter is clearly seen. Peter looks like an old man. Peter is a man of the earth. Peter looks like nothing more than being a tall older man who is trying to get his book out into the wild for his daughter\u2019s sake.\n\nIt was the cover that made both Peter Ehrlich\u2019s portrait and the cover the best impression of Peter Ehrlich by the way. Peter is the old man. He is more than just a man \u2013 he too bears this resemblance to a man. He is the old man \u2013 Peter has all the attributes of a man \u2013 not only like anything else but also like the essence of his life.\n\nPeter Ehrlich\u2019s portraits always have a captivating and unique effect. He always shows something new. Peter is always showing that no matter what he does or doesn\u2019t do, he still has ideas. Like Michael Owen, Peter is always searching new challenges which would make it impossible to ignore. Peter is always looking for something new. Peter\u2019s art is always a piece of inspiration at work. He can\u2019t stop looking at the beauty which comes from his creations and he should strive to remain that way forever.

{"id":1004,"ended":true,"length":595,"text":"At the height of the cold-war, one side launched its entire arsenal. The leader of the opposing side, adamant not to let this mean the end, made the decision to not retaliate. This is the losing-side's last message to the world.\n\nThe second decision, by itself, doesn't matter much much to those who watched, and didn't see it, on December 16th. This was the time to strike.\n\nThat decision was the moment when people decided on whether or not the Soviets would ever come back. The USSR had to lose the war, and they did nothing, in the intervening months.\n\nIt was a very good thing and I'm sure that many of you saw this coming, as we're now only a couple of months into the war.\n\nThe good news here is that it was a relatively short period. The worst was upon us. Our air force was at war with its neighboring countries. It turned out that the whole USSR had suffered the greatest losses we'd ever experienced in war.\n\nA very powerful Soviet nation was in danger, both of our nations and our allies.\n\nThe Russians also had an important advantage that day, with Russian intelligence. As part of a mission to stop their enemy, some Russians were assigned to the anti-tank group the Kriegsmarine. They were supposed to be conducting the first battle, but the action in Syria was not worth the effort. Russia would not let them.\n\nAfter they took the decisive victory, they sent their fighter plane on a reconnaissance tour to prepare for a second battle. They decided to just take the plane.\n\nIt would be too much to prepare the Germans for real and therefore the Russians decided to bomb the Allied cities. They were right. The Soviets had a reason to be worried, and they knew this. They wanted to go on with their plan for the first time.\n\nThe decision to bomb the cities was right from the start. The Germans had no reason to be. They were right to bomb them. We weren\u2019t going to wait for them to do this. We\u2019d have to be very specific in our warnings about their actions.\n\nThe Germans said no, the Soviet army would run out of gas. They bombed most of us. Now we're not going to waste our time worrying about gas tankers in Germany and we should be focusing on the bombs. If we had made it through the first battle, they wouldn\u2019t have bombed us.\n\nAllied soldiers made a decision to take the last victory after they were given that warning. All in all it's a very good moment. That decision was the best military decision. And it may not always be the right. In the long run the Germans and their allies made the right choice. But we didn't want to lose our military advantage. This was how it should be.\n\nA large majority of Germans are today as young as they are now. The Germans and their allies had an extraordinary military advantage in the war and we'd been waiting almost all year to receive that advance.","token_len":634,"entropy":[2.5476,5.6718,0.0232,0.661,5.9521,5.6873,0.4385,2.8515,5.6601,5.7817,7.0802,2.8466,6.4895,1.1113,3.7445,1.5657,8.4386,0.4775,0.5265,6.4731,0.7712,1.526,13.6474,6.5414,0.0305,2.2706,3.8668,8.375,2.0168,1.2463,2.0954,4.909,2.5704,2.64,0.4382,6.3674,5.4718,0.7869,3.7132,3.0143,1.6366,10.85,4.7901,2.375,2.1184,4.2859,5.9562,1.0363,0.7294,2.5814,0.7552,0.8999,0.0064,1.9506,4.6322,6.5498,2.9623,3.9819,4.7794,0.2192,3.6803,0.0002,3.8095,2.1071,8.243,2.5548,4.5481,0.8452,4.9435,4.3825,2.939,4.8743,0.0005,3.8507,1.2701,3.2727,4.6009,4.7269,3.5355,1.9071,1.2736,3.9275,1.2394,0.8553,3.4743,2.9926,4.1426,1.1369,1.5831,0.0002,4.4352,3.9372,1.2483,2.483,4.5643,1.5742,6.0182,4.8605,5.3878,3.5724,0.9872,0.0026,2.6769,4.7359,1.2713,3.0876,3.8851,1.5973,1.0845,2.0879,5.1831,1.8656,3.989,5.3751,2.816,0.97,1.5518,0.9099,3.1783,1.6738,7.5116,2.9358,3.8287,1.8452,8.0201,2.0246,0.8911,1.3106,0.0002,3.2385,0.8463,1.7461,3.6977,4.1934,2.8707,5.5844,4.6926,2.2212,1.587,2.195,2.0643,1.6632,0.631,3.757,2.0345,1.5357,1.8243,2.7143,3.3708,4.2525,2.5319,5.8113,1.4449,2.7382,1.0217,1.2774,1.1959,0.6527,1.4275,0.4378,1.2818,0.0002,1.9829,5.6468,0.1227,5.0228,0.321,0.1919,3.2281,1.6,1.499,4.8098,2.0921,1.8682,1.7966,1.4764,4.5449,1.9258,7.2493,3.8843,0.8182,4.835,5.0748,0.9289,1.2489,4.5564,3.6639,0.725,5.0747,7.0849,2.4126,1.4447,2.967,5.4866,0.3992,0.5478,1.4883,4.8513,6.8383,1.741,5.0192,3.3594,2.6947,1.7391,5.2978,2.0119,0.497,1.8466,2.0324,3.3463,0.4044,0.8638,0.0002,4.4047,3.9599,4.9387,3.4336,5.0133,1.8129,3.3555,2.7608,2.2729,6.4073,2.9662,3.1096,5.0106,2.0291,1.5239,2.3452,0.7871,2.0413,0.0001,1.8695,3.2947,5.029,1.1498,3.3246,2.631,3.9518,3.6492,5.084,1.6171,4.5524,6.1681,4.1988,2.0958,4.2962,4.6873,0.001,2.7205,5.6654,0.6631,3.989,5.2443,3.1376,1.0674,5.3704,3.913,1.8619,4.6763,0.2647,2.1664,5.721,0.028,2.9394,4.5495,4.754,4.0766,4.8268,0.9449,0.0429,0.9074,2.5445,0.904,4.1532,0.0027,2.1406,5.074,3.6866,3.2183,4.4328,3.6876,1.5235,2.2424,6.1441,4.282,6.8077,1.2344,3.8883,6.6373,0.811,1.872,0.4123,5.1573,3.7116,2.2572,2.4119,1.4318,3.0609,0.5327,0.0002,4.2258,4.3199,4.3375,1.5485,7.6507,3.197,0.6398,2.3042,2.9824,2.0254,6.4286,5.1468,4.7069,0.6958,2.018,7.3212,2.4049,6.7817,0.3737,1.9667,3.2717,1.9862,0.4943,2.6884,5.0584,0.8653,6.0556,3.1118,1.1834,4.5688,3.19,1.1152,0.0002,2.9601,4.0567,1.21,4.0431,2.5853,1.4954,7.0334,3.2727,7.0183,0.5855,8.4867,6.5182,7.4356,2.7097,1.3094,3.703,0.3189,6.2698,0.9658,6.539,4.1207,1.192,2.2531,2.5991,3.4768,0.9024,1.8377,3.2917,1.9293,3.0525,6.1517,0.7307,2.5012,1.5927,1.6631,1.0956,1.1813,2.717,3.4417,0.58,1.904,3.0476,0.4562,4.643,2.7927,3.2224,0.8852,2.608,3.5692,0.9535,3.1822,2.1358,1.0323,0.4267,0.0002,1.5818,5.459,0.9218,1.2897,0.7223,1.927,0.8782,5.7733,5.2932,0.0393,0.9098,0.4262,1.5417,1.8569,1.6204,2.7326,2.714,0.1281,1.4974,5.3434,1.4118,1.6439,3.7011,1.6456,2.6431,1.9905,0.7529,4.2543,4.7289,17.1111,7.637,1.3232,1.8661,0.0637,4.5452,1.0143,1.4588,0.8492,1.7094,2.5327,0.4306,1.4776,9.8841,0.1634,2.0549,1.135,0.4711,3.6164,3.5893,4.4195,2.5417,0.9062,5.323,2.9707,3.5866,3.0029,0.4738,0.5439,0.0002,1.5116,2.3654,6.1297,3.7139,1.3588,3.6406,3.7314,4.2885,2.0969,6.8715,1.7934,0.3219,2.8553,1.1115,1.6799,7.7963,5.0911,0.0994,5.4638,1.2134,6.1528,1.843,3.1147,2.8087,0.7371,0.0541,4.8694,2.1972,1.553,3.8859,0.199,3.9495,7.6355,0.6449,3.7842,3.6799,3.4002,4.1299,4.4857,1.3565,6.0279,0.3102,1.6422,5.8173,0.8184,4.5072,1.1041,2.8273,4.9383,1.9255,2.5857,0.8581,1.2489,1.7715,0.7204,3.1508,2.2374,1.267,0.2866,0.0222,0.1266,2.3959,0.6256,0.4094,0.7265,0.0002,5.0751,4.1587,4.4403,5.4303,2.1163,2.9504,1.1948,2.8689,1.1968,5.103,5.9226,6.1434,3.251,2.5055,3.4782,4.7769,4.2429,0.3058,4.746,5.5274,0.2538,3.5037,4.7041,1.0299,0.9934,1.3772,4.9861,1.126,4.5531,2.1889,0.9618,1.3601,3.8014,7.4438,0.4903,3.0775,4.144,1.4436,5.341,1.9156,5.2197,0.4955,0.3353,2.3022,7.3532,4.6237,1.4345,3.063,0.1297,3.3533,3.4887,3.257,2.6112,0.488,5.3366,1.0722,0.3175,1.8496,0.5658,2.5932,2.9966,3.4665,0.3212,3.2679,0.2991,2.6263,3.1206,4.5989,1.6554,0.7139,4.6023,1.0479,5.5371,2.0628,2.8177,1.3498,0.4399,0.4162,0.0002,4.1964,5.0466,4.1658,0.2565,4.0557,4.4106,7.4128,5.9809,5.6467,0.1191,2.8294,3.7123,2.9901,0.4409,2.502,2.9613,3.6836,0.3765,0.1814,2.731,3.9309,5.4623,3.6182,0.3283,2.464,0.9339,1.838,3.6632,2.9547,5.7237,3.2593,2.7885,5.3702,4.9094,4.9685,1.6577,6.3681,1.7971,5.3198,2.8765]}
{"id":501,"ended":true,"length":606,"text":"Sunday Free Write : Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - It was the best of times, it was the worst of times Edition: 12 hours ago \u2022 Reply\n\nI'm sure he'll come round here and find somebody to post something interesting, but this is a pretty terrible blog for him. The problem with having fun on it? Well, let's get on with it!\n\nI'm going to start a new post next week for free, and it will be something like this:\n\nAbout Me\n\nI'm a journalist and I enjoy playing soccer, and I try to make as much fun out of reading online as possible. To keep this blog from becoming too good, here are some tips:\n\n1. Go to every game. No matter what position you play at, always go to a game. Never leave before the game.\n\n2. Play on more than one team at a time. You can choose from any number of games, and you will always score, even if you don't need it.\n\n3. Play with the fans. You can always watch or comment on games on the game site and to vote for the best team on reddit, but keep in mind that this means that you can vote for them, regardless of whether you vote for them or not.\n\n4. Be able to post something new at least once a week. You can write nothing more than the first post, right until after your second post. I just use facebook when I do.\n\n5. Have fun.\n\n6. Have your opinions. When I get into a game (as opposed to the first game), I often don't like the way it is and sometimes take the time to review my mistakes. Sometimes I also find it hard to understand many of the points to which the post is being presented. If I think something is getting over my head, I'll write something new. I like to see what everyone else is saying too.\n\n7. Don't just accept what everyone else says. You don't need to be perfect or something. You don't need to be perfect to be good.\n\n8. Take a break. Don't fall through the cracks.\n\n9. Never change. It's best to leave as much as you can. Don't wait long for someone to tell you they were wrong and they regret it, because you forgot a lot. Your mind will forget what it was like after you left. You can come back in a few days and try it again. You'll need to get used to it, and if you can't, remember. In the long run you'll probably see some better times.\n\n10. Use your imagination. Your ideas will be more interesting when you leave your job than at times when you are working.\n\n11. Do anything you want about the day. Whatever you want it to be, just do it and be content. This is a very good way of doing it, and not just about having a new activity to do.

{"id":915,"ended":true,"length":595,"text":"NSA is the first agency with enough data to see common patterns behind seemingly innocent facts and behaviors worldwide. Those patterns lead to an enormous and sinister conspiracy. Conspiracy so weird and unexpected no reasonable person would have ever believed in it.\n\nThe Trump administration is clearly bent on keeping its eye on the common ground. The NSA has no such problem, and its secret surveillance programs have only been kept for political purposes.\n\nSo it is interesting to see what they see in those countries. We must never forget that we lost the ability to spy for political purposes and we will never trust these very intelligence agencies.\n\nIt is also interesting to see the use of foreign nationals for spying. There is no such thing as a foreign national. When the State Department had to deal with the use of Foreign Agents Registration Act and the Special Operations Act as its last line of defense it really only allowed one foreign citizen out of its country \u2014 that\u2019s just plain weird.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump has instructed his Secret Service to stop assisting with his personal spying activities, instead directing the agency to focus on other \u201ccritical\u201d aspects of his presidency.\n\nWhat the press has become known for, or had for the past few weeks, and to be in the public eye for is the fact that it has been used to obtain information about anyone. And the intelligence agencies do not have as much power to get it done as their country\u2019s national security apparatus.\n\nAnd there is a huge concern that there will be more such spying activities after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, when he takes office. With the US coming closer to authoritarianism, there are real and obvious consequences to this.\n\nAll the same, the Americans should certainly be concerned that something like this will happen after Trump becomes president. We will surely be seeing more such spying activities and it will also be a reminder that some of these people are part of the secret NSA surveillance system.\n\nThe secret NSA surveillance program, known as the NIST, is actually an FBI secret police program which it conducts to gather and analyze information about individuals and organizations.\n\nAnd it is something so important as a secret spy that no one who pays attention would know who they were spying on. And it is something so far overdue, as it was for years before the NSA even got involved in intelligence work.\n\nFor the past couple of decades, the US government has been using foreign nationals to conduct and monitor espionage activity, including those by the NSA. In a bizarre twist of fate, since after 9\/11, there have been more \u201cintelligence\u201d activities than ever before.\n\nEven before the US president\u2019s inauguration, several countries had begun the use of the NSA. Now after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, some countries are making the same point : USA is a threat to American sovereignty and national security.\n\nSo, the US needs to be wary of more foreign- nationals and should do more monitoring in this regard.

{"id":4266,"ended":true,"length":596,"text":"A suicidal person steps out on to the ledge of the window many stories high, as they prepare to jump a stranger on the opposite building steps out onto their ledge & tells them that If they jump then he\/she will jump also, write about what happens next.\n\nThe suicide suicide is one of the most beautiful stories a suicide can be. The story begins with a young man, who is a complete stranger, falling on the ground, and having no fear of heights. But now, being on top of a ledge, he is told by his friends, \u201cDon\u2019t jump, I can see you are going to jump out.\u201d He is told to jump onto the ledge, and before he can do so he falls into the ground again. When the friend tries to pick up him, he jumps out, hitting him and his friends in the face. The friend then jumps onto the rock, and he has no fear of heights \u2014 at all. The young man then runs from the cliff. He has to walk back to his house for the rest of his life.\n\nSuicide is a serious loss of life due to lack of self control. When you try to suicide, you will go crazy. As you are falling and having difficulty staying positive, don\u2019t give yourself any more opportunities to fall, and have a lot of fun.\n\nHow to Keep the Peace\n\nDon\u2019t take anyone as a friend. Don\u2019t hide anything or anyone you love, at all. Don\u2019t hide yourself and just do what works for your situation.\n\nBe happy, but also do what needs to be done. Even if you are completely at home, that\u2019s okay! You don\u2019t need to hide from these people. They are already scared of you and would have no problem.\n\nListen to their feelings, keep silent. Make yourself understand that if you are alone with the people around you, you need to think about what can be done. When you are alone, you can go to someone who has been there to help you.\n\nWhen you are alone with the people around you, talk to whoever is there. Don\u2019t start taking someone in the same way you are taking someone else. Also, don\u2019t lie to them, and don\u2019t tell anyone. Never tell them that you are taking someone, but they must understand that you\u2019re not. Try not to tell anyone at all.\n\nUse your voice. Don\u2019t listen to what they say or do after they finish their story, or just in a way that can be seen. Don\u2019t tell them that your friend died or how he\/she died, or which person you took to the hospital that day.\n\nWhat kind of person you are? You should always choose a friend, so that you can feel like you are the same person you always are. You should always look around you while the people around you are talking. You should spend time in a place that you could see yourself and not be afraid of anything.","token_len":635,"entropy":[12.2102,2.8609,10.7696,1.9288,3.3928,3.6816,0.8857,5.5821,1.4324,1.2385,6.4031,10.1944,7.8458,2.1198,1.6763,4.6795,2.8139,6.4121,0.378,3.0028,4.8296,8.583,3.3673,1.49,6.0337,8.2076,7.223,3.4994,2.8629,4.2145,3.3497,9.0881,9.603,0.8015,2.0308,10.1691,0.7426,3.2929,3.6953,3.6768,2.7048,0.0039,0.6843,4.7213,7.7443,2.7591,10.9465,5.1418,3.4172,3.1455,1.6558,1.5984,1.5809,0.0244,2.984,5.4098,5.103,1.6653,4.2789,0.5414,0.7392,0.9241,6.2079,3.7208,5.7064,4.4095,0.8606,2.0611,1.1598,2.4079,2.2756,2.383,0.953,1.0661,2.6514,0.8454,2.6263,1.789,1.6529,3.2885,6.2675,1.5335,1.6384,4.9519,2.5837,1.5537,1.8541,2.1868,2.5847,3.5614,2.1855,5.2083,0.9618,3.7963,0.8419,4.978,4.9363,1.6089,5.5783,2.8798,2.6038,0.0981,0.9868,3.5017,0.9586,1.0443,2.2217,4.3503,1.8301,1.3377,2.3703,1.897,13.6504,6.4069,8.7707,4.0631,9.9183,3.2843,2.3757,1.4949,5.4122,3.957,2.47,1.7833,2.6893,2.8029,0.4659,2.3972,5.5536,2.3645,1.8957,7.1138,2.7557,2.5387,2.1331,1.7737,2.4813,5.6705,0.5681,0.7224,1.5981,1.5809,5.4628,0.5268,0.2948,1.2674,0.2129,1.6759,2.2346,3.4548,0.8872,2.0877,6.1662,0.9241,4.2816,2.0944,4.2774,4.3547,0.1245,5.1448,1.5866,2.4566,0.6473,1.0266,3.435,2.2732,1.8809,6.2402,2.1768,3.7256,4.1273,0.9632,1.7738,0.0526,1.0207,0.7706,1.8867,1.3933,2.2689,3.0709,2.9592,0.3278,7.117,1.4861,1.3004,3.7916,3.9676,1.4244,0.7123,0.3135,0.0889,6.484,4.7422,3.0487,0.3903,2.182,4.0245,0.0578,2.0502,4.5466,3.9616,0.3432,4.9393,3.2725,2.2706,3.4294,2.8542,3.5225,3.0984,0.9728,1.0153,2.4787,3.8344,2.015,1.8618,0.0082,1.2381,0.1065,0.6924,1.0076,0.0002,7.4564,0.0658,1.2627,1.6692,6.2787,7.4691,2.1563,0.7258,6.0163,0.0287,4.0372,0.0069,3.3136,2.2524,0.8289,3.8652,1.7031,4.9868,0.1784,6.5946,0.8624,0.7572,3.1018,4.8498,4.3718,0.8798,4.4518,1.6481,2.4648,4.2907,3.3628,4.3659,3.6294,4.2528,7.2148,0.6649,6.1416,5.5457,1.9085,0.0199,4.5363,3.8967,2.3544,1.8904,3.8943,0.4312,3.9589,2.2032,2.2041,5.5039,1.8462,3.7706,0.8171,1.4646,1.2034,1.7215,0.0002,4.5848,1.1392,6.0304,3.4801,4.9439,0.9959,0.0002,3.3863,0.1507,0.0186,0.003,4.0043,4.8024,3.6665,0.7456,1.5306,1.1449,2.1478,0.0199,0.0117,0.0009,6.1161,3.3397,3.3525,3.4269,2.8912,4.6473,2.2018,6.0527,0.3222,0.4768,1.0658,0.0096,0.0034,0.0068,4.1046,4.0753,3.9857,4.9986,3.8799,0.9127,3.6478,0.4697,4.474,3.3135,0.3169,1.7649,0.0002,4.0064,4.3353,1.5409,3.1658,3.8372,4.2772,1.2083,6.195,0.1131,0.0947,0.021,0.7594,6.052,0.449,0.4744,1.3756,5.7515,4.4388,4.1368,0.6261,5.5617,6.0963,0.1912,1.8404,2.5374,4.3218,2.9233,2.5557,0.1474,0.1712,0.0023,1.2387,0.2965,2.707,3.6651,6.6979,0.9274,1.2133,3.1617,1.4896,4.673,6.496,1.2804,0.6418,1.8916,5.4425,3.8304,2.0661,1.7131,4.3427,1.0464,0.0002,6.6992,0.5432,3.72,3.1029,1.1985,5.9339,6.1265,1.9487,4.8725,3.4821,4.2695,2.6576,3.3693,0.4234,2.0141,4.1599,3.5241,3.9741,2.0113,1.3001,0.019,0.4015,1.4793,3.4137,0.1361,5.0587,0.8078,1.4547,4.9177,0.7343,0.0562,1.3635,4.3496,0.5338,1.2205,0.9992,0.5935,1.6464,2.3051,4.2008,1.7321,4.1262,2.1114,2.8734,2.4323,1.7495,4.155,1.372,0.3209,1.1079,1.2202,0.0002,3.4144,0.3103,0.6933,0.7307,2.0826,1.4199,0.1015,0.0123,0.0038,0.0517,4.6987,0.761,8.4485,1.5249,3.0621,1.2054,3.0733,0.0345,0.007,0.0011,5.6464,5.2396,4.708,3.9654,2.8034,1.7065,0.5071,1.4959,2.4651,0.7209,0.568,2.9541,0.4956,6.8641,0.6549,1.3943,0.0261,0.0102,0.0011,5.2713,1.2746,1.8361,1.8534,2.7995,2.0516,0.0219,0.0062,0.0033,2.3642,2.7321,2.0309,5.0155,1.6328,1.7118,1.7893,0.3955,1.0224,4.0174,0.5913,2.9733,2.3502,3.19,4.6104,1.9256,0.8838,0.7216,7.06,0.0999,1.2157,2.7028,2.7575,6.1626,2.2689,0.0155,1.6637,1.713,5.0701,0.1714,0.5914,0.5695,0.0002,5.863,1.4872,2.9383,1.5016,1.8909,0.0137,0.0071,0.0016,4.4884,0.1545,3.2063,3.2461,0.4108,2.6132,1.7162,6.9172,1.3534,5.3429,3.2258,2.4864,1.7894,1.9695,4.4809,5.0264,2.487,3.0992,0.1945,4.3905,1.2781,4.2414,2.7783,1.8469,0.0068,0.0048,0.0068,2.0912,0.6136,1.2792,3.7182,3.9886,5.141,3.4168,5.7168,1.4518,0.5328,0.0091,1.4083,1.1228,1.0952,7.6117,2.7204,1.4072,5.6644,2.637,1.1855,0.6466,5.0607,0.3466,0.545,1.3878,0.0002,5.3958,4.5203,0.0017,2.2652,4.0645,0.2751,2.9415,3.6559,2.4317,3.6693,5.2076,1.8715,1.5653,2.7182,4.7813,0.8221,0.7,0.8496,3.2322,3.1412,0.558,0.5357,2.9246,3.632,0.2379,1.8701,2.7189,2.5357,0.2592,2.9748,0.647,1.1063,4.0086,3.821,1.7143,5.5966,5.0679,2.3941,0.1073,0.0061,0.322,3.0252,1.5461,2.5385,0.2183,6.9673,0.9582,2.6328,2.4975,2.4783,1.0445,2.0477,5.0185,3.3059,2.3188,2.8774,2.5069,1.5322,1.5788,0.7863,2.9496,0.5317]}
{"id":2964,"ended":false,"length":592,"text":"A 15 sentence story about finding love in the darkest of places... maybe on the shore of the ocean.\n\nThe Sea of Thieves Story:\n\nA 15-member gang of robbers is about to wreak havoc on the city of Salerno as well as the surrounding areas \u2013 including the capital city of Rome, the southernmost city not far from the shore.\n\nWhat if they somehow caught the thieves?\n\nThis very specific tale tells the story of two men, Mario and his mate Lucio, who fall in love as a result of a gambling bet. One man is completely caught up in their own game and has begun his search for his missing wife to recover their wealth. Mario sees the two in his bedroom and asks her to find them. Lucio asks a few more questions about what they do together, but is not willing to get too technical and begins to make up new situations.\n\nAs a result, Mario decides to ask Lucio for his love life that day, with the exception of his own, or at least his fiance\u2019s and his family\u2019s (and probably the other).\n\nSo what should Mario do? It certainly feels like he is going through something as well. He decides to be an artist. Then he realizes how important it is for the two of them to meet their destiny. To this end, Mario and Lucio meet up at a beach and begin their affair. Later on they are given a secret which enables them to enjoy the most romantic and passionate affair in the city.\n\nMario finds the man he wants in his room and leaves the apartment, hoping Lucio will give chase.\n\nThis story is set in the first edition of the Sea of Thieves game (1st Edition). This is a really epic adventure which starts in Rome and goes on into the Mediterranean coast of Sicily. There\u2019s a huge sea scene which is full of sea-magnons.\n\nThe story is very different from the previous version as Mario falls in love with Lucio, who is now happily married (although not officially with Lucio. Now we can only remember his wife, so not sure if the romance was actually there, and not as sweet as she was). Mario\u2019s friends were already with Mario, but at this level, he\u2019s going to lose his love for Lucio or move on. So he tries to find Lucio, in a dream, which will eventually involve getting hit by a train. The dream ends up being one of the happiest and most touching stories about the first edition of the Game of Thrones book (and thus probably the most powerful one) as well.\n\nThis is how you get a free copy of the book (for an extra \u00a35 you get a second edition) for the first edition of Sea of Thieves. It\u2019s not free (if you still need a copy of the book), but if not, there are a couple of other books in the first edition which you can order online too. (I\u2019m sorry for the extra cost you\u2019re paying and the two-day shipping!)","token_len":637,"entropy":[7.7764,10.2892,11.7311,2.8149,7.6991,4.7257,1.6372,2.0098,5.1559,1.549,2.4059,5.3725,7.096,5.8259,1.4609,6.1318,0.4219,2.1693,2.8062,1.4689,1.5246,0.0436,2.9049,7.794,1.471,4.4874,5.9006,2.2734,2.9364,0.0003,2.2557,2.4753,1.6839,7.2515,4.2407,0.6003,5.2009,3.4418,3.7306,0.0213,6.9782,0.0019,0.0985,0.6994,1.1046,2.2448,0.5709,6.6686,2.4096,4.054,4.6553,0.0682,1.0825,3.8254,3.1727,8.6863,2.9831,0.964,5.2774,1.791,0.5149,3.5692,2.0878,2.1587,5.6668,1.7494,0.5199,9.1141,0.729,0.0911,1.2825,5.4337,1.0903,0.9949,0.0004,5.0039,4.3623,4.0536,6.097,4.5928,2.0792,3.0691,1.4412,0.8849,0.0003,4.14,6.4774,4.8341,4.1821,2.7264,0.7514,0.5009,0.0258,2.5042,2.5944,2.3474,7.5042,0.5106,4.1579,6.928,5.3319,1.8895,0.4166,0.3178,5.4983,0.4626,0.0186,4.1935,1.8334,0.7711,0.0042,1.4019,7.1881,3.3617,1.0807,4.9894,3.1505,1.9124,6.0602,5.9161,0.7403,0.098,2.9441,3.4526,5.1141,1.861,3.4814,6.9492,3.8919,3.7821,0.143,2.1922,2.4076,1.7744,4.9138,5.1848,1.8065,4.0157,0.6054,3.8849,6.1288,1.9554,3.399,3.9716,3.1231,3.9895,1.1695,3.8237,5.2092,1.1477,4.187,2.9963,1.1208,3.1548,0.0044,4.6675,4.2313,2.9502,3.1208,0.0957,2.1446,2.9252,2.392,3.349,3.8189,1.2512,1.1595,3.5163,3.8017,4.5408,0.03,5.4894,2.9892,5.3444,3.0826,4.9897,0.6601,4.2641,2.8604,4.7983,5.9601,1.0298,1.094,0.0003,4.7063,2.804,0.6799,0.629,1.0387,3.643,0.134,4.715,1.6906,0.0063,2.5809,2.2231,4.8869,4.2986,7.1836,4.7674,1.6905,4.7165,1.1176,6.3183,0.0931,2.4776,2.0825,4.4403,5.714,2.3209,0.166,2.698,6.311,13.0774,6.7752,4.0834,5.4851,2.5748,3.8642,2.3092,0.0827,0.7627,4.7331,3.193,5.7438,2.5143,3.3905,5.4212,1.4556,0.0002,4.5034,2.1879,4.9501,2.8953,0.3446,0.849,4.9302,5.5806,5.2278,0.4774,1.3855,2.2097,3.0275,2.9345,2.5438,5.096,4.4881,1.2161,2.7289,2.8261,0.1491,5.1302,3.7947,4.5563,2.8617,5.7686,1.0148,4.6876,3.8174,3.1615,0.8832,0.0827,2.149,3.2435,3.4308,0.8147,0.0119,0.1887,4.1267,4.5539,4.6471,0.9603,5.1837,4.1459,0.4937,0.1929,1.696,2.5919,0.1975,0.002,4.0475,1.7734,2.525,1.1842,4.4093,2.6929,2.9772,1.8773,7.6363,0.4103,5.5668,1.8459,3.6721,2.9142,5.1001,0.9773,5.647,6.8624,5.6048,0.2164,0.0391,6.1679,1.617,5.1535,2.8705,2.7278,5.483,4.8347,1.3679,0.8953,2.8738,0.7634,0.5032,0.0002,3.8121,4.2823,2.6769,4.1465,1.9841,3.0407,2.5528,1.2172,2.6938,1.0016,4.67,2.4952,4.4061,2.6055,4.0688,3.4782,0.0015,0.3744,3.6735,6.8689,0.4846,2.0852,0.0002,3.623,1.338,1.1701,3.8858,0.557,1.0553,4.5188,5.5063,0.0645,1.0212,6.021,0.068,0.0018,3.8665,3.8196,5.2407,1.7739,1.1551,1.3799,2.8885,1.9115,1.5253,5.9657,6.3454,2.3011,3.5845,5.1745,2.6833,4.3807,1.1399,2.5432,0.6854,4.131,1.2817,4.2674,3.9498,1.4741,2.3849,0.7512,3.4053,14.2667,1.4929,0.183,1.1705,3.4615,3.2817,7.0924,2.9654,1.7715,5.2955,0.0173,4.9797,4.0572,5.7887,5.9318,9.8758,1.9448,1.2246,0.0002,1.917,1.5297,1.5804,3.0177,3.3282,0.4689,0.7941,2.2911,3.9335,3.6148,2.6878,6.9973,0.3127,0.0073,0.1449,1.6345,0.0038,2.0756,2.2876,0.7849,3.6904,6.043,0.1408,4.7753,3.4593,2.5689,4.6852,5.4566,3.4283,0.0153,4.2881,6.1307,3.912,2.7079,3.0999,6.3565,2.362,3.8751,2.3309,4.8733,4.9388,2.0172,1.1133,3.3328,3.6536,3.0694,2.6078,4.8476,2.5146,4.1174,3.1781,4.3691,5.9532,0.3555,3.3012,2.3704,2.2617,3.0921,9.9174,0.1468,0.0777,5.7336,5.7028,3.8442,5.6749,5.2778,2.2298,1.7408,5.0722,1.9219,7.3354,1.8656,2.3032,6.4835,0.0705,0.0216,4.7036,0.5505,4.3395,1.2562,2.472,1.3598,1.643,0.0025,6.1329,7.2454,1.3727,1.0555,2.723,1.7322,4.8657,0.3266,1.7284,2.2804,0.0014,2.0827,5.6165,2.8432,3.4819,1.4234,3.9375,4.2809,4.4495,5.6665,4.2888,6.2154,0.4346,0.4491,4.1363,0.943,3.3317,2.5691,2.2453,1.6881,1.3005,3.835,0.3294,0.7543,5.3689,2.8196,0.1929,4.8856,3.1986,4.1173,1.3497,4.95,2.1587,0.2829,0.3217,4.8858,0.6972,0.8732,4.2609,3.4258,3.6101,4.9415,4.6893,0.4461,1.5921,5.2829,2.8089,3.5534,3.3757,0.9961,2.0977,0.2411,0.0002,2.8687,1.5456,5.9608,2.3716,2.0487,2.1777,5.0985,1.9468,0.1484,0.91,2.5197,2.8519,4.0398,4.8114,1.0248,1.6537,1.8099,4.4111,1.815,1.1472,5.5121,2.1485,2.9791,3.131,2.7955,0.7089,1.7328,0.8376,1.9497,0.0228,0.0004,1.0469,2.685,5.8128,0.1584,0.0137,3.4913,3.7584,3.9247,3.9077,0.1685,6.0898,2.4096,2.4978,0.4243,1.8748,0.6218,0.6655,3.8844,0.3952,2.0736,7.51,0.726,3.923,1.0829,1.7927,2.0064,0.1149,3.2346,2.7178,2.9801,0.3932,5.4867,0.3348,1.9155,1.6305,0.3225,3.8512,3.25,5.4156,0.4232,4.7607,2.942,6.3046,0.4842,0.3999,3.1058,2.2368,0.6132,5.5121,1.8351,5.033,6.852,0.1217,3.056,0.2787,4.6267,2.6559,6.2659,3.8626,2.8239,1.7639,4.3849]}
{"id":4160,"ended":false,"length":577,"text":"Years after First contact with an alien species, the children from both worlds are being encouraged to write to their counterparts as pen-pals. Years after the initiative was struck, the only message received in our latest delivery begs for our help in defending our allies against a third race.\n\nIt is a common theme throughout the stories of First contact with intelligent extraterrestrials. The messages, usually delivered while a child is asleep, are quite familiar, and they are well received. However, there are also some more new messages sent every day. A number of these messages, however, are too much to digest, and the messages are quite disturbing.\n\nThe messages are delivered to the children, along with some personal notes, along with a few other things. Children also receive special messages about extraterrestrials from their teacher who had the message printed and sent to them recently as a kind of encouragement. After all, some of the people who were actually at a school during the day, were also present during the period.\n\nThese messages should be read or seen separately from the children that were in attendance or sent to them that day. It is important to note that all such messages should be read by a teacher with a basic understanding of the history or geography of our world. So don\u2019t give the children and siblings\u2019 message, as they are not taught much about the history of technology, or about the history of our world.\n\nIt is an important day that we celebrate this important day. Our goal is to teach children that their children might have a future with other technologies. For this reason, Children\u2019s First Contact will continue to be a very important day.\n\nYou can also find information on the web, which discusses the issues of the First Contact campaign on these pages. Contact our email service: Email@firstcontact.us.\n\nWe also have a list of different websites that contain important educational materials, such as materials on the history of communication science.\n\nFrom the website about the First Contact campaign, you will find information about the importance of learning science for children.\n\nHere you will find various information about the First Contact campaign, and whether you should consider sending your child to the local kindergarten or in the next generation schools to learn more about the history of communication science.\n\nFrom what information we have seen, kids from 2nd to 3rd grade have been participating in this First Contact campaign. If you notice any errors, please report them to us at at-info@firstcontact.us.\n\nThere is also an article about the First Contact campaign, which explains that there is a lot of history of communication science behind the First Contact campaign.\n\nIf your child wants to participate in this campaign, please note that the information about the campaign is very limited, and that the

{"id":2612,"ended":false,"length":548,"text":"A pair of southerners - good ole boys, never meanin'no harm - wake one morning to discover that their beloved '69 Dodge Charger has been replaced by an identically painted DeLorean DMC-12 with California plates.\n\nThe car is a new one, priced at $2,100 -- and, like the DMC-12, its chrome exterior has changed a bit in time since the original owner was first seen in the 1970s.\n\nNo official figures were released for the original DMC-12.\n\nIn a statement, the Dodge said the car is \"being rebuilt to make it look like the original, and that new body was designed to be more like the original car as well.\"\n\nSo the DMC-12 has been replaced by the new Dodge Charger and the DeLorean DMC-04.\n\nThis car is similar to the other DMC-12 \u2014 and, in fact, the one that was sold in 2013 for $1,295,811.\n\nThe DMC-12 has red, blue, white, and green alloys. That said, it's still known to have a number of red and blue accents on the vehicle.\n\nSebastian Williams, the brand's president and general manager, said he didn't know what the exact color of the car was, but that he thinks it matches the truck.\n\n\"It has a very distinctive stripe and it's quite distinct,\" says Williams. \"So I think it's a very appropriate choice.\"\n\nThe brand has also recalled its Dodge cars for having red accents. But Williams' explanation may just be the way the car looks.\n\nHe believes a red or blue color scheme might be a good match to the truck.\n\n\"I would say this is a cool vehicle to look at, but it may be a bit off,\" he says.\n\nThe truck is being replaced by a red-and-green DMC-12 with California plates, with the brand also asking consumers to fill out the vehicle's insurance claim form.\n\nWhile Williams claims the vehicle is \"clean and clear\" and shows no signs of tampering, that doesn't necessarily mean it is safe to drive.\n\nWilliams says it's important to be careful of the red paint.\n\n\"I think it's actually more like a sort of a subtle color that we like,\" he says.\n\nBoth vehicles have color-coded paint, and, because of the current condition of the DMC-12, the company says they should remain safe, even after owners remove it from parking spaces.\n\nOn Monday, Williams told The Times that the truck may not be able to pass inspection due to the new California plates.\n\n\"They probably gave us that red paint before they had the California plates,\" Williams says. \"I don't know what it's going to look like now.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

{"id":1714,"ended":true,"length":620,"text":"Billions of years ago, the Earth was a biological weapons research facility for an alien empire. There was an accident and the planet's science teams were killed, the empire has now returned to clean up the biological mess they created only to find us...\n\nThe most interesting thing about the US economy, in a nutshell, is that we, the people of the US, are being made to look up to the same shit, the same shit that you are. But now you don't give us a pass because you think we are not a country. You can't even talk about it, you can't even try to.\n\nIt's like, if you were President of every country, you would try to make all of us look like one government and keep everything from the public, but the other nations would say nothing about it.\n\nThe US is now a global threat. Let's try to be as smart as possible with our decisions, we need to let a fair part of the population know we are doing something right and maybe we should stop trying and start saving money in areas where we actually have our place, let's not talk about all of us being an object that should be discarded in a heartbeat because we are a country of our own making, don't talk about our real problems and don't talk about our shortcomings without explaining what we are doing wrong and why.\n\nThat's actually what we really need to get out of this nonsense.\n\nIn the interest of realism, the government should stop using the term 'human being' when speaking of other civilizations of this sort. I just use the term for the first time today, and I don't agree with the way that the word 'human being' is used here. There is no need to use these terms again, it already has the potential to be useful.\n\nHow much more do we care about these idiots at the White House? That doesn't even count the $200 billion they are spending in the next decade on things that were meant to be 'normal'.\n\nAre these people on the brink of extinction? The only thing they care about is their personal greed and the power of their power is their money. Which is why people are constantly in the same position as Hitler as they were. They are at the bottom of the totem pole, while the people at the top are looking for jobs in China and Japan and Europe, and they just have an extra $100 billion saved. That doesn't even count the $500 billion they are spending in the current year on things which they could be giving to other nations and getting less and less involved in in a way that can be seen as good or bad.\n\nIf those people really want to take care of these people, which the whole world does, they should stop caring about these people. The real people care about what the US is doing and it should be about saving money wherever it can. It's time for the US to stop doing what they have always done. Stop caring about other people and your own interests and start caring about your own priorities and not getting involved in political campaigns to help stop people from hurting themselves.","token_len":639,"entropy":[8.8369,0.7521,5.7267,0.8758,0.3643,2.1696,5.8005,0.9892,2.8067,8.5794,9.7941,7.2485,2.1758,4.5382,5.0586,3.217,5.3618,0.8331,5.1934,1.3884,2.8545,6.0949,2.7628,1.5952,3.1992,2.9237,6.1917,5.2132,0.8527,2.8416,2.1105,4.1127,7.0097,5.3218,3.414,4.2318,0.5341,8.4913,0.6585,1.4951,9.6281,4.8442,3.9084,1.3492,8.5071,0.3686,2.2489,7.8518,7.4454,2.3174,0.0201,2.6528,5.6863,3.4264,1.7285,0.3454,1.6874,7.2566,6.27,2.8136,3.1589,3.1682,1.7343,0.1203,0.0947,0.4833,2.9408,5.5636,0.877,1.8177,1.7736,0.7814,1.5352,0.2371,1.3272,3.9266,4.1316,0.9335,2.9249,8.0205,0.1542,1.2713,3.6676,6.3217,4.0891,2.605,0.3417,3.2114,1.1455,4.2445,2.9312,2.2183,4.7276,4.615,2.7877,4.2084,0.001,6.08,2.4,2.1236,3.5491,2.6309,1.426,2.4766,0.6034,0.9948,4.7242,4.0795,3.8515,1.189,1.527,5.3612,1.1198,2.8132,4.9436,0.6135,2.0577,2.4794,1.8617,1.8073,0.1645,0.8842,5.3362,0.4935,4.7616,1.582,0.0002,3.511,0.7022,2.6336,2.5443,3.0667,0.7816,2.7616,6.0977,1.1424,7.7117,1.1182,1.3391,1.0229,1.1442,4.414,0.258,2.7975,4.1197,1.3908,1.5972,1.9528,0.934,5.863,4.783,2.9445,5.6244,3.977,2.804,3.6621,3.252,3.0136,2.3855,3.3426,4.7872,3.7719,1.786,3.9973,4.9837,2.2693,0.437,0.6474,1.5687,0.0002,2.8543,2.2893,1.4302,3.7784,1.8607,3.7394,6.5505,1.2163,6.2968,0.2863,4.3967,0.3842,3.6677,2.6866,3.6984,0.1828,0.7361,4.7716,1.1559,6.3244,1.6215,3.1659,2.9622,0.1896,5.8469,5.3981,5.8867,6.4028,0.0208,0.8923,2.0229,0.4102,2.5654,0.7886,3.173,2.3522,1.662,2.2656,6.2499,1.6128,2.5743,3.5715,2.8877,4.3246,2.8665,5.5844,2.7291,4.0974,7.1394,1.2983,0.7605,5.5015,1.6592,5.1999,5.5523,2.63,5.0327,0.1696,2.6337,4.9392,0.1061,4.6273,0.8931,4.4648,3.2509,5.5628,5.7064,4.0247,4.2908,0.4636,6.234,2.9525,2.38,5.8615,3.7514,0.7717,1.2771,3.0625,3.0748,3.6469,4.4415,0.3401,1.482,1.9211,5.6821,0.0009,2.0279,0.0708,2.9267,5.5491,2.0339,2.2326,4.0445,0.0003,1.5676,0.0171,1.7882,6.2335,6.2386,6.6683,2.1499,1.0718,0.8658,0.7877,2.4185,1.4701,1.6691,1.1573,0.3382,0.0002,4.449,0.6239,5.6469,1.4484,1.7658,4.5531,0.4745,0.333,3.737,2.3607,0.3313,1.3762,6.2603,0.8996,1.3228,0.0002,4.3267,1.4867,6.1789,0.0029,7.1357,0.2862,3.3645,4.7225,1.5381,2.8293,3.2996,1.6251,2.405,1.9747,3.5625,5.1605,0.277,2.9269,4.8408,1.0913,5.0362,7.0659,6.0205,3.0381,2.5184,0.6005,3.931,4.5058,6.3199,1.2798,1.0047,3.5468,2.0047,5.6623,1.5185,4.1876,1.4725,2.3631,1.2138,2.5594,0.0004,6.1113,0.1873,1.7236,2.8078,2.3486,1.976,2.5811,0.8044,0.5801,2.7869,0.0182,0.5698,0.4445,3.157,0.399,4.541,1.2243,1.3002,3.4859,0.6375,0.8833,6.5082,0.7092,4.9896,1.6508,2.8367,5.7017,1.5795,3.4716,3.9301,0.2778,1.2327,4.8435,1.122,0.6261,0.0002,5.5519,3.6246,2.4427,3.3534,1.1145,4.2869,0.416,4.2707,7.0205,5.6156,1.0461,4.452,0.0089,1.1613,4.5885,4.2973,0.0003,2.0505,3.244,1.0543,5.8209,3.7097,0.7399,2.2797,2.3334,2.0156,3.5232,1.8711,2.4685,3.1477,1.594,4.8269,1.8384,5.0576,5.552,0.1965,0.7197,4.7336,4.1446,1.0801,0.9868,0.0002,5.8997,3.4237,1.1304,4.7845,1.0934,4.381,0.0505,2.6763,0.5457,3.8181,3.4844,1.4443,2.0175,2.1,0.024,0.3413,2.4019,4.8067,5.6679,1.145,2.9703,4.5371,1.1654,1.1345,5.2118,5.0563,2.5868,3.8005,0.4016,6.3935,0.8307,1.069,4.885,2.057,4.9514,5.2514,1.4206,3.8848,1.8699,2.0241,6.4725,4.7923,1.0613,2.0006,4.3115,2.5674,1.2916,5.2908,0.7646,3.2067,0.2024,0.3131,4.4889,0.0547,1.465,5.3106,1.0617,2.7757,2.5651,0.0525,0.0683,0.7063,5.5711,1.5894,5.3729,3.2999,5.3649,1.3369,2.7065,1.7585,4.1381,2.1497,1.8209,1.7244,4.6349,3.7926,5.3655,4.6235,1.2005,2.0874,0.7205,6.1443,2.0805,3.5405,3.7783,0.0002,0.8019,1.0401,0.4261,1.795,3.302,0.1537,0.5656,0.9887,1.3326,1.8864,0.9734,5.874,3.1016,0.6437,2.3257,4.6784,2.614,3.9518,2.8983,5.0408,1.6685,3.1924,1.8039,2.9131,5.1435,5.9432,2.8139,0.0606,6.3675,0.3178,4.1232,2.985,1.9195,0.6175,4.7772,1.8434,2.7745,0.3201,4.0247,2.5342,0.3359,0.6693,0.353,0.0002,3.2776,5.5784,1.1324,2.6305,1.836,0.2415,4.0167,2.0542,0.0139,3.463,0.9929,0.5555,6.4005,4.244,5.6939,0.6506,3.9708,0.8153,1.5342,0.9443,2.1604,6.3976,0.3261,2.6478,0.7184,0.8169,2.7968,4.1372,2.778,4.0161,0.1906,3.0348,2.4483,2.3102,1.6213,0.1977,1.6604,4.2701,2.4343,0.7391,3.1568,3.2803,1.2669,7.1712,0.5978,1.2935,1.0056,2.6243,1.2914,3.6464,1.3176,1.0767,1.3397,0.3642,1.2494,3.4068,1.2917,1.8702,2.557,3.7833,0.1546,1.6166,5.8968,4.2178,0.2454,2.6872,0.8259,1.7683,6.3048,1.4259,3.1251,1.8985,2.6969,3.1617,0.2463,2.0013,0.051,5.6255,1.7501,2.7045,4.5473,0.5292,0.1295,4.7491,2.7847,3.8511,3.4122,7.0871,2.8723,0.5122,4.3052,1.4613,1.003]}

{"id":241,"ended":false,"length":565,"text":"You've become infected with a deadly virus and have to come to terms with your imminent death, shown through a series of letters to a loved one.\nI've become infected with a deadly virus.\nIt can be fatal -- and you, the reader, are immune, according to a recent study.\nSome doctors say, if you're an HIV positive, you have a high risk for infecting others, according to the researchers.\nEven without treatment, the virus can cause serious, death-related illness and make you very vulnerable to infection.\nYou could also be infected with Covid-19 -- which causes Covid-19.\nScientists are now studying whether the virus can survive the immune response -- showing that it can't survive in humans as well.\nA coronavirus infection may make it deadly if it is left untreated\nScientists have discovered that the virus can survive the immune response -- showing that it can't survive in humans as well\nIt could also make it deadly if it is left untreated.\nResearchers analyzed blood samples from all 16 people who had come into contact with the virus in late December and early January.\nThey found that, as blood samples became collected, their immunity was much weaker than that of other subjects -- and that one of them had severe Covid-19.\n'Based on their early symptoms, this type of disease is more lethal than the other, although this appears to be due to the virus being left untreated,' said study author Yury Sennov, professor of infectious diseases at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n'This is not the first time the virus has been detected in humans. However, it may be the first time that it has been detected in these samples of Covid-19 infection,' he added.\nIt may also be the first time that it has been detected in these samples of Covid-19 infection.\nThe study's author Yury Sennov is now studying whether the virus can survive the anti-viral medication rifampin.\nIn the future, Sennov hopes he will be able to get the medicines that he needs. So far, no medical treatments have been able to prevent the development of Covid-19 through the immune response.\nBut he added that 'the idea that there is an immune response for Covid-19 is interesting. It may not be the first study ever done in humans, because there was a study that made a similar claim about the immune response after Covid-19 treatment.'\nAccording to researchers, Covid-19 has an immune response that can keep the body away from the coronavirus and maintain immunity against the infection, which may be useful after treatment.\nHowever, the scientists warn that if the virus stays active, the immune response isn't as effective as it used to be.\n'There's a good chance that the anti-viral treatment may result in an immune response during Covid-19 treatment,' said Sennov.\n'If not, it may not be able to keep the infection inside. At the least, it may be the first time there is a vaccine used before these treatments.'","token_len":642,"entropy":[5.5189,6.1345,7.7756,0.8782,1.8366,4.2545,0.7624,2.7808,2.6992,1.7189,5.3138,1.302,2.0229,0.0319,2.0825,7.5649,0.3835,1.8175,12.2456,3.7239,2.6028,1.8721,0.0025,6.5164,2.5101,2.9358,3.2182,0.048,1.1496,2.388,12.3533,2.0558,3.5275,0.4238,0.1059,0.2261,0.0163,0.0052,3.7877,1.5238,3.3618,4.4203,1.1356,4.4258,7.3298,2.6212,2.9149,5.6834,2.4264,2.5784,0.1062,1.896,6.6553,3.7718,6.6068,0.002,2.3069,2.4089,1.0741,1.2429,0.5845,4.9415,3.4532,2.0618,5.2911,3.3568,0.4457,1.6607,4.4312,3.0989,2.3053,0.6167,0.7164,3.3255,1.5058,3.2495,0.813,1.9755,5.2417,0.1432,1.8255,1.8439,3.3951,0.0022,1.3832,5.7066,0.8383,0.4629,4.9981,4.7568,2.5979,0.1805,1.9349,0.6127,0.3144,1.2854,2.0611,4.6056,7.3106,0.1468,2.9927,3.9414,3.0591,6.0131,1.0731,4.8472,2.258,0.1601,2.7424,0.9334,0.2935,4.4645,3.785,2.2769,1.5557,1.1021,0.6487,14.7379,3.0074,7.5332,7.3038,3.4654,3.3861,2.2655,13.3572,0.0508,0.5135,0.6393,3.4091,0.5916,6.1512,3.047,2.18,2.8772,2.8818,1.833,0.4921,1.0471,4.1216,2.8621,4.5194,1.1257,3.8542,7.3003,0.8985,1.1657,1.0908,4.1182,3.5497,1.8835,3.5456,4.8971,0.6937,0.5188,0.2039,4.088,7.7858,0.0132,0.002,4.081,3.7366,4.051,2.4305,4.9705,3.7038,1.3346,3.1469,5.2897,0.4575,4.2471,3.6354,1.8985,3.5951,0.7566,2.0314,0.5824,0.6466,1.0461,1.2081,0.2636,0.0302,1.1978,0.0896,0.0802,0.0016,0.0023,0.0081,0.0043,0.0125,0.0364,0.0051,0.0009,3.0181,3.0816,3.0748,0.9354,3.3036,1.4357,0.7795,0.0991,0.4062,0.236,0.1241,0.0023,0.9692,0.3867,3.0502,6.7958,3.6421,0.348,0.9369,4.7325,5.1074,0.9795,0.5595,1.5849,4.827,1.3006,0.0478,0.0048,0.8602,0.1548,1.842,5.2079,4.0106,1.8694,1.0279,0.0602,0.7371,0.6421,1.383,0.7566,0.4944,3.795,3.3365,6.5084,2.2161,3.943,5.0553,0.8278,4.0284,4.8485,2.1695,4.7153,2.3613,1.0673,3.2816,0.2528,2.6629,5.1197,4.5411,1.9993,1.4837,5.4633,1.2804,1.6302,1.2767,6.2481,5.2186,0.0022,0.027,0.0152,1.1037,0.1866,3.1885,6.9105,0.0591,3.4444,6.3643,3.6942,0.5341,3.298,4.9178,0.0414,3.7963,1.2022,3.1919,4.85,0.6036,2.4786,1.4968,2.8464,4.4403,3.1053,5.3744,0.1249,0.2213,2.6566,0.0957,1.3507,1.9823,1.5139,1.8911,0.155,0.8549,1.0808,2.4531,1.8374,6.1061,4.2902,4.0026,6.89,4.0579,0.6984,3.4441,0.1827,1.5944,0.4881,0.4432,0.7523,1.0635,0.0087,2.2906,0.3553,2.0218,0.0018,0.3901,0.1391,1.2421,2.2831,1.4362,2.6551,2.0662,0.5437,0.3241,2.943,0.5342,0.0596,0.3746,4.1499,0.3552,2.4193,1.3408,3.5132,0.0461,1.338,3.2011,0.7251,0.8095,0.5806,0.3782,1.3255,1.4424,0.3362,0.2769,1.5186,0.1459,5.0054,3.6632,2.8352,10.5022,0.0341,0.0749,0.0151,5.751,4.468,0.6006,1.8935,0.0711,0.1254,3.4706,2.7255,0.9339,0.2426,0.8418,0.0395,0.0513,0.3741,1.0773,0.0964,0.0129,0.1167,0.0144,0.4149,0.0163,0.0039,0.1414,0.0007,0.0004,0.0017,0.0318,1.5191,0.4668,1.9146,2.668,3.7129,4.3513,4.0315,0.0128,0.0091,0.0031,0.0022,4.6625,4.0553,3.3532,0.9927,0.4817,0.0772,0.0736,0.0104,0.0504,9.221,0.0275,1.083,0.0321,5.012,7.7902,1.3277,0.0041,0.0246,1.4204,0.6752,3.5995,1.8546,5.282,0.0667,2.7169,0.0172,0.0049,1.7187,4.4076,1.3298,1.4318,0.0157,0.0044,4.5044,2.0738,7.4937,2.7362,4.1014,1.0558,3.3683,7.1668,0.3951,0.174,4.3189,6.0133,2.1917,0.3853,0.1418,3.9174,0.0015,1.7795,0.7719,6.9313,0.0561,1.9408,0.001,0.0126,0.0027,7.0002,1.5021,1.0148,0.8159,0.4073,0.1909,3.1231,1.8892,4.5148,0.5996,5.1583,2.5892,4.6431,0.7855,2.9472,1.0817,2.2952,1.6078,0.3465,4.236,3.5236,0.0017,0.0291,0.0023,1.0031,4.4493,2.1159,1.6302,2.3991,2.5318,0.5547,2.1512,2.4699,7.2628,6.22,3.2529,2.5621,0.6338,1.424,5.3365,1.9052,3.3045,1.394,2.6011,1.8233,6.2702,2.1889,1.0615,2.6376,2.1695,1.9339,2.1652,0.2488,4.8954,4.3583,0.0025,0.0386,0.009,3.4787,0.9877,0.2082,5.1945,0.0017,3.6027,0.4454,4.0976,0.0011,0.0338,0.0022,2.7678,4.0314,3.2218,0.4175,0.9255,2.7599,4.8784,2.1369,2.4977,6.3441,0.0239,1.7908,11.6234,0.0014,0.0318,3.1115,7.4503,2.0722,2.8212,1.6574,3.7488,2.4335,1.9801,2.9977,1.7906,5.0676,6.4172,4.5897,0.7602,0.2755,3.5796,0.0249,1.7507,4.5824,3.8419,0.1714,3.068,1.4792,0.9751,4.2685,4.6978,1.2007,2.1233,1.338,0.6243,6.1607,0.0005,2.661,3.7318,0.751,0.8251,2.8828,0.0021,0.016,0.3208,0.2902,1.9049,3.3234,2.1077,1.3786,3.8654,0.2606,0.3478,1.7556,6.0681,0.0177,0.1231,0.0755,3.4346,2.6945,5.9386,0.0025,2.7266,1.9331,0.2175,7.1551,7.4987,0.0024,0.0029,0.0019,0.7569,1.4087,0.654,1.3762,0.013,0.0055,0.1355,0.4839,1.1532,2.7652,5.6037,0.2572,1.8399,1.5061,1.7376,0.4271,2.4844,0.0014,2.8819,0.6051,4.1579,6.8579,4.4248,5.1808,1.8747,4.5331,0.0988,1.2402,0.7483,1.8525,3.712,1.1545,0.4953,4.381,2.6008,0.872,2.6856,5.3846,5.0962,5.4842,4.3479,1.9102]}
{"id":2843,"ended":false,"length":608,"text":"A zombie virus breaks out in a middle-school, forcing a nerd, a jock, a cheerleader, and a goth to band together and fight the zombie threat.\n\nThe book is a collection of 25 books, most of them written by an 11-year-old English teacher, while the majority of the characters live in a home, with their parents as hosts of the class games \u2013 they can be found in every corner of the home. The story starts with a boy running around with one of his friends, in the back yard.\n\nThe nerd has to help the gamer, who also happens to be one of the kids he played as. Soon after, the gamer has a friend who helps him beat the zombie threat, and has them play a game called The Zombie Games. This is a game for zombies you can play on a computer at home.\n\nThe student asks a group of gamers to pick out a zombie, and is given a map with more information and weapons available in the areas surrounding the school. Once the game is chosen, the student turns to his friends and asks that he do the same thing again. Soon, it\u2019s time for everyone to leave to join in the game and for the zombie to run wild.\n\nThe game ends where everything is. The gamers get excited and run as fast as they can. Then they get a message from their friends that they missed the game. They\u2019re all locked out of the game while other students go on about their night of fun and being together for the first time.\n\nYou can purchase The Zombie Games at any of the book-stores in the city, or by visiting the book store on the website. The game works the way it does and the gamers seem to enjoy the experience.\n\nShare This Post\n\nComments\n\nI'm guessing you live in the United States? If so what is your store like? I would like to see more games around. I would love to get some for the Wii too.\n\nWhen I was in school, my teacher had one of my best friends (yes, we're married) that loved videogames. She would run out on me playing games, and it made me realize to what degree I needed to improve my computer skills. The day after we finished our first time, we came home and we had a whole long night. She had an 8-hour shift.\n\nI guess you live in the Uk, which is an area made up of a few nations. You can find it in a store called \"The Store\" and you'll find your best friend on your PC or Mac or whatever. I remember there was an episode about the UK. On the TV show that I watched, the British soldiers were making a movie version of The War of the Worlds.\n\nI also remember you live in an area called \"Kirby\", which is the same as \"Kirby\". I think you will find there's even more games than you see on the shelves but it's impossible to find there. You will find a store called \"The Game Centre\" located at the edge of Kirby City.

{"id":2456,"ended":true,"length":596,"text":"( CW ) Write a passive-aggressive recipe that slowly reveals why the writer is angry in the ingredients and the cooking instructions, and write on the dish that the writer doesn\u2019t trust to cook properly, or the writer won\u2019t cook properly.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but in reality, it is your attitude that matters. If you can\u2019t tell someone something is not working, tell them why. If you can\u2019t trust someone to work properly, don\u2019t trust me if I tell you it\u2019s because I don\u2019t trust you.\n\nFor Example: if you had never read \u201cThe Secrets to the Power of Words\u201d but read as much about Shakespeare to as much as you learned today in school, and are a believer in science, and really like a good book about writing, then you definitely know that I don\u2019t expect the same level of enjoyment in your kitchen.\n\nAs a result, you may be confused about what you are talking about. It\u2019s easy to think that, or at least that what you want to hear, but in reality, you\u2019re telling someone who isn\u2019t exactly making you feel good.\n\nIf you\u2019re really good at what you do, you know that you\u2019ve done far more for the world than you learned in school. To this end, you want to convince \u201cher\u201d that she knows for sure what she\u2019s doing. But to convince the rest of your family that she doesn\u2019t know for sure, you need to convince them. You don\u2019t actually believe her and therefore don\u2019t want to convince them.\n\nYou\u2019re thinking of \u201cthe book\u201d that you found on a popular TV show (the one about the secrets to the power of words). The book is called \u201cYour Secret to the Power of Words\u201d. You won\u2019t be convinced that anyone else in your family is reading it even if you do.\n\nThe book is based on a true letter written to an aspiring poet. A true letter, written by the writer, can only be copied by her. If someone wrote to you, they must either believe you (if it came from you) or they must be lying.\n\nThis letter, by a writer, made you believe that her actions and words should not be trusted. If those words in \u201cYour Secret to the Power of Words\u201d are honest and honest, they\u2019ll be able to pass. In the end, they\u2019ll say something about being sincere.

{"id":540,"ended":true,"length":640,"text":"You are going down a long road in the middle of night. Every 15 minutes or so you pass by a hitchhiker with one arm raised, asking for a ride, but you decide to ignore them all. After a couple hours of driving, you start to realize that you're passing by the same hitchhiker over and over again. You have noticed, the man next to you doesn't know a thing about life. He doesn't know anything. It's like he is trying to figure out everything he knows, so he is only interested in your personal interests. At this point, you realize, what the hell is not to like. You can't change who you are, nothing, you are just a fool. At this point, your heart melts and all of a sudden you look up at him, he gives you a big gulp of wine and you start to relax.\n\nYou had the choice of moving. Anywhere in the middle of nowhere to hitchhike. Or you can move back and forth to a place where you are really safe. Anywhere in the middle of nowhere to hitchhike. And for the rest of your life, you are not going to get any sleep. You have no idea where you are going anymore. It is that day, where something has happened where you are so tired and have no motivation to climb and hike anywhere in the world. It is the day, where you are not going to be where you want to be, but you just keep climbing. I mean you always have an excuse to go out. If it is a really bad thing, or you just can't climb on a rock, you want to go home and sleep, just because you aren't able to climb. But when you finally do pick up the phone and your head feels the cold chill over a cold beer, its time to go home and get your pack filled and the beer is gone and the beer is gone too.. You go out into the freezing cold and find yourself facing down a man to find the end of your life. If you ever see one of those creeps, just look up and say hi. I am telling you, these are the people who should NEVER be allowed to be out there.\n\nThe best thing to do is look up, and look up at that creep in the mirror. Look up as they pull you in, and it is that moment, you are free and you are doing the right thing in the wrong way, and that moment, you look up and you get a chance to know someone. It is that moment at the end, when a person you loved and loved, has a chance to be with someone he should never be with.\n\nThe next best thing is picking yourself up. You are ready to pick yourself up, and it is for good. And you are making every opportunity available to you to move in the right direction. Make sure that you let yourself get a chance to move from where it should be to where you want to be. Go back to where you have always been, and go back to the day you were born.

When the data is displayed in 3D, strange ripples in the data can been seen. A few days later, someone realizes those aren't ripples... it's them trying to write on the computer...\n\nIn our society, computers have become the world\u00b4s most powerful, dynamic data processing units. They can generate rich, dynamic, and complex data that needs to be analyzed simultaneously. At the same time, they can also operate independently with minimal knowledge of the human body. If, however, the human mind wants to work with powerful data sources... and has access to valuable and relevant data, then there is one simple solution...\n\nHere is an easy-to-understand tool that helps you to analyze your own data in three dimensions. Once you understand the way to analyze your data, then you can create your own data models with a variety of different methods of visualization. The best part of the tool is that you can use simple visualization tools for the first time and understand your actual data in two ways. The first way is to analyze your data using a 3D flow...\n\nThis tool aims to develop a 3D flow using data and machine learning algorithm, that will work for high-quality and rich data, with simple, easy-to-use visualization tools. The result is a powerful tool which will help in the research of computers. When creating your own 3D flow, you will have the chance to see all the data that contains information and its functions right...\n\nComputer scientists are skilled in working with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in addition to their work towards developing the technical and business intelligence technologies. Some of the best computer scientists are: Alexander von Humboldt, Max Planck, Albert Einstein and Vladimir Lenin. Computer scientists are able to discover many of the world\u00b4s information and understand many of the world\u00b4s economic systems. These computer science students study the...\n\nThe following program builds the AI software that is built with the purpose of learning algorithms for the purpose of optimizing computer algorithms for a high degree of accuracy. The program uses specialized algorithms to create a new machine learning system. This tool is in the same generation which was developed by CERN in 1997 with the purpose of optimizing machine learning algorithms through the use of new algorithms which would improve...\n\nFor example, the problem of the flow of information between a source and a target object can be solved by modeling and developing models and algorithms that relate the source to the target object. This technique is known as the 'flow of information' method. This method is particularly useful for creating computer software which is optimized for the purpose of understanding the flow of information between two sites. In the flow of information...\n\nHere is an example of the kind of data produced using an AI program.

It will be fun.\" I'm proud of you.","token_len":660,"entropy":[7.0671,5.8784,1.199,7.1989,4.0053,2.4817,2.933,5.1355,1.1939,1.0407,6.0862,9.6735,3.1549,4.4378,7.614,1.6874,9.3778,3.5874,0.0391,2.0343,4.1193,4.4056,1.8374,2.8422,4.1368,1.9636,3.7099,3.6212,1.5853,5.2294,0.4767,6.5962,1.839,1.541,1.5889,5.1075,3.2481,4.416,0.0016,2.4956,2.6187,1.0618,0.054,1.4577,1.0664,5.8196,3.3275,0.3529,4.983,4.7932,1.9456,6.7414,3.2733,4.8245,1.4086,1.0683,3.5122,6.6688,8.1095,3.2731,3.6585,5.9205,1.8167,4.673,2.0449,1.3476,2.041,4.602,4.7951,2.0288,1.1011,3.4581,3.4059,7.3501,0.4848,0.0004,0.899,5.2367,1.9729,0.5038,0.4121,1.3984,0.0718,0.0053,0.0051,0.0076,0.0024,0.0016,0.043,0.0024,0.0015,0.0125,0.0031,0.0013,0.0135,0.0003,0.0172,0.0026,0.0027,0.0015,0.0144,0.0631,0.1656,0.027,0.0032,0.0107,0.0094,0.001,0.001,0.0011,0.0007,0.0009,0.0005,0.0027,0.0031,0.1267,0.0146,0.0165,0.0006,0.002,0.0022,0.0041,0.0007,0.0013,0.0043,0.0051,0.0012,0.0014,0.0011,0.0057,0.4727,0.9159,0.0001,6.8913,2.3258,4.1331,2.0127,1.9701,3.217,0.3149,5.4986,3.7889,5.3698,5.6858,1.512,4.1468,6.7206,1.719,2.395,3.1291,4.3869,3.12,0.5237,5.0014,3.6575,2.0259,5.0437,0.9542,7.1879,4.5957,1.7915,6.7615,3.5256,4.6331,1.5449,7.9814,2.0819,0.0623,0.9743,6.267,1.8564,6.1797,1.1859,1.0613,1.3607,5.0245,1.6165,2.1448,5.5218,2.0755,1.6981,3.1629,0.4859,5.0501,2.6204,0.4093,6.7898,0.6412,0.5711,0.8494,4.5456,0.9912,4.0383,3.4137,2.2206,2.0636,4.8264,0.936,0.8367,3.6658,3.7702,3.0825,0.8181,0.8861,1.5711,2.1933,0.5177,2.0588,0.5644,4.2372,1.4426,2.0826,1.2592,5.3245,8.085,5.3977,0.5208,4.7729,0.5642,0.9503,5.1827,4.9283,3.7747,0.8369,6.1218,2.4087,3.0119,1.3214,0.3173,2.1444,0.8913,1.9216,2.2398,4.5542,0.3556,0.3774,0.9679,2.9613,0.0001,1.9535,1.6431,0.7614,0.2776,0.0193,0.0031,0.0006,0.0122,0.006,0.0004,0.0018,0.0016,0.0137,0.0073,0.003,0.0083,0.0061,0.0088,0.0002,0.0006,0.0006,0.0006,0.0022,0.0008,0.0016,0.0,0.0019,0.0016,0.0315,0.0036,0.0061,0.0013,0.0079,0.0004,0.0029,0.0019,0.0011,0.0009,0.0003,0.0003,0.0028,0.0055,0.0017,0.0012,0.0087,0.001,0.0014,0.0004,0.0019,0.002,0.0014,0.0002,0.0006,0.0006,0.0005,0.0024,0.0021,0.0157,0.0016,0.0056,0.0068,0.0045,0.0011,0.0003,0.0004,0.0015,0.0046,0.0089,0.0039,0.0024,0.0169,0.0011,0.0029,0.0057,0.0011,0.0006,0.0009,0.0284,0.1304,0.0006,0.0092,0.009,0.0009,0.0014,0.0018,0.0009,0.0008,0.0073,0.0023,0.0035,0.0015,0.0175,0.0021,0.0061,0.0032,0.0021,0.0005,0.0447,0.0208,0.0045,0.0008,0.0006,0.0005,0.0009,0.2338,0.0001,0.5614,4.0449,1.6179,3.2396,2.0511,0.9048,0.781,1.1254,1.1092,2.3117,6.2948,0.9718,0.7373,3.7651,0.7528,1.9043,2.0989,5.177,0.6072,3.3714,2.2553,3.6866,3.1348,0.7326,4.9817,3.3896,2.5919,1.6558,1.9103,4.2884,5.6464,1.4048,0.3114,5.346,3.1048,2.3572,5.9347,16.9303,7.5985,1.5644,3.6719,5.4049,3.553,3.1131,0.6348,4.9743,6.5865,2.3134,2.0514,1.2852,2.5828,3.9354,6.069,4.1945,0.5531,6.6172,3.8446,1.4996,3.8969,1.9265,0.1285,0.0065,4.2496,3.3085,0.6879,1.7313,5.0814,0.5609,0.0705,0.0049,3.0694,4.2729,2.0891,2.2239,7.3781,3.0246,4.085,0.7095,3.9357,1.0381,1.8862,4.9458,0.9968,6.2945,1.5916,2.6573,3.0257,0.3394,4.0049,6.0196,1.1621,0.7325,0.7584,0.9256,2.0521,2.8054,2.3468,1.2376,7.1816,1.2561,1.1795,0.4293,0.6033,1.1576,4.8512,1.2838,4.9466,0.779,7.0802,0.6991,2.0813,4.1747,2.1927,0.258,2.7155,1.8876,1.4122,1.8849,4.5468,1.7667,1.4804,0.496,0.7541,1.5531,0.0001,0.1619,4.9549,1.5915,1.5788,3.8828,2.0003,1.3616,4.3244,2.0975,5.165,0.2935,2.0996,5.9785,0.9462,4.8803,4.598,1.3902,3.0514,2.1512,6.2984,3.0944,1.3826,0.5878,0.1362,2.4214,1.0791,0.9953,2.7415,3.5038,1.4872,3.9353,1.9303,1.9481,2.6631,0.7312,0.9698,1.8348,1.3026,2.7987,0.8945,3.383,0.1307,2.1185,0.4705,4.1286,0.7054,3.5966,2.0812,1.8278,3.2614,1.8454,0.9466,4.5846,5.6972,1.1975,3.4296,6.8803,0.0164,2.3616,2.477,5.2293,5.7893,0.1497,1.2192,1.4685,5.165,0.6836,1.3762,2.7201,1.128,2.9817,4.2977,0.0319,1.8249,1.6145,0.6855,0.2336,5.4354,4.2664,6.2346,4.301,0.7425,0.7795,2.4292,0.0001,0.0613,1.7168,2.3074,0.6321,0.6798,0.1902,0.0027,0.0996,0.4483,0.0138,0.013,0.006,0.0063,0.007,0.0136,0.0126,0.0068,0.0412,0.0004,0.0006,0.0005,0.0005,0.0027,0.001,0.0015,0.0,0.0044,0.0018,0.0344,0.0044,0.0048,0.001,0.0084,0.0005,0.0027,0.0012,0.0015,0.0014,0.0004,0.0003,0.0034,0.0046,0.0055,0.0016,0.017,0.0011,0.002,0.0005,0.0016,0.0018,0.0015,0.0003,0.0007,0.0007,0.0004,0.0034,0.0021,0.0097,0.0021,0.009,0.0055,0.0071,0.0013,0.0002,0.0005,0.002,0.0033,0.0198,0.0099,0.0024,0.0103,0.0009,0.0029,0.0062,0.0014,0.0006,0.0009,0.0077,0.1769,0.0009,0.0045,0.0109,0.0012,0.0017,0.0013,0.0006,0.0007,0.0022,0.0022,0.003,0.0013,0.0174,0.0072,0.0062,0.0033,0.0019,0.0009,0.0377,0.0035,0.0046,0.0031,0.0006,0.0004,0.0007]}

{"id":3255,"ended":true,"length":619,"text":"A tourney of strength and skill is traditionally held to win the princess \u2019 s hand in marriage. This year the winner is a woman.\n\nThe contest is organized by the American Legion, who has a strong tradition in the world of sports, and it will feature a number of different entries that have been published in the world of sports since the mid-1990s. This year\u2019s entrants are the American Legion and the Kansas City American Legion.\n\nIf you would like to win the ultimate princess hand in marriage (in a prize swap, and maybe even in one of the grand grand prix titles), you can use one of the following ways (or even try it!), but only if you select certain words:\n\n1. Say to all your male friends, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I wouldn\u2019t really let a woman marry me. Why? Because I\u2019m not willing or able to do that because I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n2. Say to everyone who wants to win the princess hand in marriage (or even think about it, and then only if they want to and will vote for the winner and it\u2019s still a prize swap!), \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I wouldn\u2019t really let a woman marry me. Why? Because I\u2019m not willing or able to do that because I can\u2019t do that because I want to marry this man.\u201d\n\n3.

Why? Because I am not willing or able to do that because I can\u2019t do that because I can\u2019t do that because I want to marry this man. No, I won\u2019t be willing or able to do that because I can\u2019t do that because I want to marry this man. No, I won\u2019t be willing or able to do that because I want to marry this man. Don\u2019t, and you won\u2019t either. Don\u2019t try. Try not to try to make me marry this man, because you can\u2019t marry a man who is willing or able to do that for me, because it is a mistake for me, because it is an act that my best friend is trying to create for her. And you know what? It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with being willing or able to marry this man!\u201d\n\nThis is a very exciting month for the American Legion. The team of volunteers are extremely motivated to honor every season the veterans leave the field through the Heroes in the Home contest in which they are selected to win the ultimate princess hand in

{"id":3928,"ended":true,"length":619,"text":"A world in which diseases, such as the common cold, were able to be transmitted through the Internet.\n\nThe Internet is a new technology that allowed scientists to study the health of millions of people. It offers the freedom, while being a complete technology, of having time to communicate with one another as well as be able to see their friends more easily. Scientists can also collaborate with researchers and friends on different projects.\n\nMany different companies, from private to government, make their products through the web, but if they use the new technology, there is one simple question, what happens when the old one dies?\n\nIn the long run, the Internet will become the new communication technology. In the longer run, the Internet will become the whole world of research, information exchange and communication with one another.\n\nWhat does a disease outbreak make?\n\nAccording to the latest World Health Organization reports, more than 1 billion people in the U.K. have pre-existing conditions, about 100 million of whom have chronic bronchitis. The condition causes a viral infection called pneumonia or bronchitis pneumonia, and some 80 to 95% of people have chronic bronchitis.\n\nSo what causes a disease? It is estimated that, by the end of 2020, the number of people with an illness would be more than 100 million, or 25% of all patients with any one of these conditions.\n\nSome treatments for chronic bronchitis, including medication, are also under consideration, although most treatments are still far from being completely cured. There are therefore many potential solutions : a cure for the condition or the drug that makes it worse.\n\nAt the same time, the disease itself is complex and unpredictable. All of the treatment plans currently being developed are still in development. The most successful cure is found in a single agent, which is also known as a vaccine, and it is important that the pharmaceutical companies do not underestimate the amount of potential diseases that will occur in this way.\n\nFor the best outcome, all treatments must be proven and effective. This will include in the short term the use of more effective drugs such as medicines, such as antibiotics, or the vaccine itself.\n\nThe virus itself contains the same virus that causes and causes most colds, and is also related to it. It has a similar name to the chikungunya virus. Even though the bacteria it carries are not necessarily the same ones of viruses, the human population is very small, and even though the bacteria it has is similar in number to that of viruses, it may not always be completely immune. In the long run, however, it is better to avoid the bacteria that cause the symptoms of colds.\n\nThis is why we need more effective drugs, and the most effective medicines are now being developed with a better safety profile. The research and development of these drugs can also give us a better and clearer idea about the potential of a disease, which has been well known already, in order to avoid the development of a disease that would not be fatal.\n\nThe current results.

{"id":738,"ended":true,"length":589,"text":"A prison guard goes to great lengths to make the pun `` a small medium at large. ''\n\nA prison guard goes to great lengths to make the pun `` a small medium at large. ''\n\nCatherine Lister is a longtime resident of St. Albert, Ont., and an expert in correctional management. She knows the art of keeping the public safe; she knows not to keep the prisoner from running away, and she knows nothing about the nature and consequences of dangerous cells.\n\nLister, 47, of Windsor, Ont., is president of the Prisoners Welfare Welfare Forum, a network of community and prison leaders, lawyers, health experts, and advocates for safe and secure services in the workplace.\n\nShe first arrived in town to live at the age of 16 \u2014 about 17 years earlier than the inmate population in the GTA.\n\nHer wife has worked in police for the past 13 years, and in prison she has seen a large drop in crimes due to increased training.\n\nWhen she was first given a chance to live in St. Albert, she had first hoped to have an annual leave to teach in the Ontario Centre for Public Justice, which she described as \u201csomething I\u2019m very, very proud of.\u201d\n\nWith the help of an older sister, she moved to the Toronto area, working at the same local correctional institutions that she has previously taught at other places: St. John\u2019s Correctional, St. John\u2019s Prison and St. John\u2019s Correctional Centre.\n\nShe has taught at a number of the nearby institutions since her arrival in town. Her research has included the potential for inmates to take the \u201cbrave\u201d step of becoming criminals without being caught, while avoiding the criminal justice system, and taking a break.\n\n\u201cThis can really be a very dangerous, but also important, aspect of keeping people on their feet and staying engaged in the workforce,\u201d Lister said.\n\nShe is also a teacher herself, teaching students on the fundamentals of public education. So far, she has not taken a position teaching at the provincial level, but she has helped her colleagues at St. John\u2019s in prison and St. John\u2019s in Windsor.\n\nShe has also been part of an advisory board at various locations, and a volunteer board for a provincial youth support group.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful that there is a lot of funding for prison education, so I hope to continue my education in some capacity,\u201d she said.\n\nLister said the role of prison guards in keeping society safe is not uncommon, with some people often getting caught in the middle of it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing,\u201d She said. \u201cBut they should be the ones monitoring the inmates\u2019 lives and helping them put themselves at risk.\u201d\n\nThe best way

{"id":1295,"ended":false,"length":640,"text":"There are many types of Mages in the world. Fire, Ice, Wind, Water, Death, Darkness, to name a few. But in this world, every type of mage is treated as equal. Everyone can be a good guy, no matter how dark your power. And anyone could be a bad guy, no matter how beautiful their ability...\n\nThe most interesting thing about Magic is that it has a much stronger connection to the world than any other game, and while it is not as popular as fantasy-like, the world is as well. It really gets people involved in the world of Magic.\n\nMagic is not a game. It is a profession, and it has nothing to do with money. There are no rules and nothing to do with the world of Magic. And it is not because you play as a bad person! There are things you must do to earn money, that are very important in Magic because everything else is done as a normal person to make money.\n\nThe players at Magic are actually good people. They can be really bad people. Especially if they are evil or greedy, but they don't care about money. All that matters in Magic is that both players have skills and abilities that allow them to create fun life for themselves and their friends. They give a lot of work for their characters and for their world. So don't forget that Magic is not a game if the players enjoy it.\n\nYou will have your adventures in Magic, but you do not have as long a life as everyone else. Don't forget that every person who you take on the court can have fun. Do not underestimate the game. If you want to play Magic, it is not bad to enjoy it.\n\nThe best thing about Magic is that it has no rules. It doesn't matter how much money the players can get or how bad their characters get. They can earn money! It is a very fun game.\n\nMagic is not a game for you. It is a sport. Magic is a game for your future. Magic is a hobby and a profession. Magic is a game because you love the game. We give all of our time for the game, it is a wonderful experience.\n\nMagic is not a game. It is a profession. Magic is not a game. Magic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby. It is a hobby and a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nIt is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMovies are very important in Magic.

{"id":2316,"ended":false,"length":640,"text":"There are many types of Mages in the world. Fire, Ice, Wind, Water, Death, Darkness, to name a few. But in this world, every type of mage is treated as equal. Everyone can be a good guy, no matter how dark your power. And anyone could be a bad guy, no matter how beautiful their ability...\n\nThe most interesting thing about Magic is that it has a much stronger connection to the world than any other game, and while it is not as popular as fantasy-like, the world is as well. It really gets people involved in the world of Magic.\n\nMagic is not a game. It is a profession, and it has nothing to do with money. There are no rules and nothing to do with the world of Magic. And it is not because you play as a bad person! There are things you must do to earn money, that are very important in Magic because everything else is done as a normal person to make money.\n\nThe players at Magic are actually good people. They can be really bad people. Especially if they are evil or greedy, but they don't care about money. All that matters in Magic is that both players have skills and abilities that allow them to create fun life for themselves and their friends. They give a lot of work for their characters and for their world. So don't forget that Magic is not a game if the players enjoy it.\n\nYou will have your adventures in Magic, but you do not have as long a life as everyone else. Don't forget that every person who you take on the court can have fun. Do not underestimate the game. If you want to play Magic, it is not bad to enjoy it.\n\nThe best thing about Magic is that it has no rules. It doesn't matter how much money the players can get or how bad their characters get. They can earn money! It is a very fun game.\n\nMagic is not a game for you. It is a sport. Magic is a game for your future. Magic is a hobby and a profession. Magic is a game because you love the game. We give all of our time for the game, it is a wonderful experience.\n\nMagic is not a game. It is a profession. Magic is not a game. Magic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby.

{"id":801,"ended":false,"length":640,"text":"There are many types of Mages in the world. Fire, Ice, Wind, Water, Death, Darkness, to name a few. But in this world, every type of mage is treated as equal. Everyone can be a good guy, no matter how dark your power. And anyone could be a bad guy, no matter how beautiful their ability...\n\nThe most interesting thing about Magic is that it has a much stronger connection to the world than any other game, and while it is not as popular as fantasy-like, the world is as well. It really gets people involved in the world of Magic.\n\nMagic is not a game. It is a profession, and it has nothing to do with money. There are no rules and nothing to do with the world of Magic. And it is not because you play as a bad person! There are things you must do to earn money, that are very important in Magic because everything else is done as a normal person to make money.\n\nThe players at Magic are actually good people. They can be really bad people. Especially if they are evil or greedy, but they don't care about money. All that matters in Magic is that both players have skills and abilities that allow them to create fun life for themselves and their friends. They give a lot of work for their characters and for their world. So don't forget that Magic is not a game if the players enjoy it.\n\nYou will have your adventures in Magic, but you do not have as long a life as everyone else. Don't forget that every person who you take on the court can have fun. Do not underestimate the game. If you want to play Magic, it is not bad to enjoy it.\n\nThe best thing about Magic is that it has no rules. It doesn't matter how much money the players can get or how bad their characters get. They can earn money! It is a very fun game.\n\nMagic is not a game for you. It is a sport. Magic is a game for your future. Magic is a hobby and a profession. Magic is a game because you love the game. We give all of our time for the game, it is a wonderful experience.\n\nMagic is not a game. It is a profession. Magic is not a game. Magic is not a hobby or a profession.\n\nMagic is not a hobby.

{"id":1564,"ended":true,"length":648,"text":"Suddenly, without warning, the sun just went supernova. Describe the last minutes of Earth.\n\nThe last known explosion was the April 23, 1958 explosion that killed around 2,000 people and shocked the community, while the first two incidents occurred in 1966-1967, the same year that the explosion occurred. A lot of the people who did not recognize what transpired were told not to report the loss because their stories would be told later.\n\nThis is what happens when a man and a woman are on the moon, and one of them is killed because they decided to put on a nice dress and had an experience like this.\n\nThe only time the man and woman were seen in the camera was to witness to them how they were being treated in front of others, but otherwise that was just pure evil.\n\nHere is the picture they captured of the night that night:\n\nA black and white image of the sky below is what they captured of what happened to their victims. The camera shows how the images were blurred, with the exception that the black outlines represent the time when their images were taken and the blue outlines represent where the dust was, and which part of the image they were shown where dust is.\n\nThis was captured in Los Alamos National Laboratory (LAL), an important location for the first scientific analysis of the earth. The scientists were in attendance as they performed the analysis of the image of the sky above.\n\nWhat happened in Los Alamos was amazing. A very special place for the scientists to be at. When we look back a few years later, we will certainly remember these people from that night.\n\nA lot of the people in Los Alamos were young children, but also people who had been raised following the experiments. They were the most enthusiastic and enthusiastic ones.\n\nOne of the children died. When the other child was around, they found someone who was pregnant, and got all of the information they were looking for.\n\nFor the first 5 to 10 years of the year, the children would be allowed in the same classroom which was still on the same floor, at the entrance. Now they started to play games, but they started to feel so guilty about that and would start to walk away.\n\nThe children had an attitude that they got to be part of what was going on in a room, by playing with the objects which they were using.\n\nEventually, some of the children started to behave a little bit more towards the adults and some of them started to become violent. Some of them had to be taken away. In the end, they had to be thrown out the room (or possibly locked up).\n\nFrom the point of view of the scientists, there were no problems with the children's behavior.\n\nThe scientists were very thankful for those who they knew through the experience. They said that after the study and because they could see the scientific data from Los Alamos, it was not easy for them to get hold of the data.\n\nTheir observations from the ground level were able to reveal the dark and beautiful features of the earth.\n\nAs stated previously, the experiment which helped to save the life of the people who had been born is also quite exciting. The scientists hope to use it, to bring them back to Earth, and to help the world and our planet stay healthy from disaster.","token_len":689,"entropy":[2.7335,7.4121,1.3358,0.1816,1.4315,5.9091,6.6655,3.5085,6.7637,0.3581,1.0806,10.7874,6.187,1.7623,5.6599,5.2675,0.6077,6.4908,6.0712,1.1895,0.0393,2.7397,3.4565,6.6448,4.276,1.9354,3.2884,5.9441,3.479,0.2048,4.3648,2.4819,1.8733,1.3861,7.4168,3.2612,0.1782,0.5295,0.1811,2.0519,6.1098,0.5738,6.6922,3.162,5.1274,1.4381,3.6515,4.1483,6.5757,2.4492,1.3883,4.8195,5.2495,2.79,2.0322,2.9416,3.9538,0.1535,1.2572,1.2072,4.7714,1.7803,0.2284,4.4956,4.7685,0.2922,2.6926,2.2705,1.109,5.1404,0.8402,4.9985,3.3277,7.2104,2.1564,4.8522,3.5576,0.0068,4.7854,1.8002,7.7258,3.448,4.1577,4.7067,0.9729,0.6133,4.5001,4.1433,0.6384,0.8944,0.0002,3.8179,1.8613,2.2724,2.5679,0.4311,2.4397,4.7607,3.173,0.6747,0.1373,2.1273,4.5225,0.5079,3.6623,2.289,1.669,3.4056,0.667,0.4084,1.5003,2.6689,4.0784,1.8239,6.9076,0.3492,5.5345,1.9552,0.6251,5.1251,3.0643,1.2707,5.7615,3.4554,5.9131,3.9958,1.4638,0.6726,1.1547,0.0002,2.2885,4.9365,3.6455,2.406,3.1918,1.4079,0.2152,2.1307,3.9375,2.4423,1.1085,5.247,1.4077,4.1366,5.6065,7.2974,5.1812,9.1047,1.977,1.6496,3.3106,1.9445,2.6453,3.7795,0.0043,4.5152,2.029,3.1773,7.1904,4.3096,1.4705,2.7216,6.6042,4.6939,0.3168,0.7368,0.0001,4.9689,0.8729,1.637,4.1556,5.3143,4.1328,1.2684,1.0284,5.1772,3.1131,2.4716,1.3461,0.1914,0.0001,4.1645,5.728,3.0399,0.1191,1.5506,0.6859,0.7737,4.0965,4.8505,2.9071,2.7228,2.9427,3.0059,2.2024,3.2091,0.9667,2.7872,3.5531,4.1155,0.8442,2.3697,5.0775,3.3982,4.0628,1.2321,5.1059,1.6633,4.1431,2.1971,3.7534,1.2057,5.4786,2.3833,0.9525,2.6662,6.4199,6.6196,0.7947,5.9567,2.0518,3.9378,4.7628,0.3211,0.8822,3.0356,1.1244,3.9774,0.7379,0.4461,3.4231,1.3246,6.8806,1.2634,4.2338,1.8676,5.72,3.5735,0.1004,0.1604,2.8867,1.9291,0.7172,7.1613,6.6513,8.1367,3.1647,0.4903,0.5113,0.0001,2.9041,2.4581,5.9718,1.9716,6.8271,2.6621,0.0021,0.6189,0.1092,2.4148,1.1721,11.7431,3.1058,4.2281,4.5472,3.4692,1.5734,1.5406,4.9346,6.6983,5.3212,0.1881,0.9854,4.533,1.2546,1.8853,4.1739,1.9023,3.7194,5.1913,3.7431,1.553,4.8783,1.7998,2.5084,2.3284,0.6974,4.3467,2.9032,0.3643,1.054,1.8707,1.0584,0.9012,0.0001,4.2514,2.1627,2.9217,1.9308,0.0016,0.0047,1.3039,5.4018,0.6482,3.7931,4.356,4.4641,2.5074,1.8918,1.822,1.9278,1.2896,1.8681,3.0059,0.9646,4.9785,3.0782,3.3367,0.8034,5.6497,1.5738,0.5373,1.0151,0.5007,1.1682,2.3329,6.055,0.6353,3.7622,2.8645,4.8471,2.5837,2.1262,0.819,0.6446,0.0002,3.8718,3.2507,0.1165,2.0049,1.8156,2.7833,2.9736,0.0015,0.0025,1.5783,4.8115,3.976,1.5296,2.7971,4.008,2.5007,0.5479,1.5571,2.013,3.0994,8.4814,0.7976,5.0743,1.7182,1.8094,0.9777,3.2032,3.4031,4.2695,1.8546,2.7126,5.3952,0.8715,1.3219,0.0001,3.3438,0.4759,0.4657,3.7297,5.775,3.0777,4.8691,1.829,3.0823,2.3263,1.157,5.7299,2.0482,1.7797,5.7682,5.8213,1.4944,1.3081,6.539,1.9069,0.9389,5.9993,5.2894,2.3675,0.7197,2.2406,1.059,3.8329,1.0224,0.0133,0.5197,1.002,0.0001,5.195,1.5254,1.7332,6.8011,4.1726,0.6272,1.4266,1.6526,1.7686,6.9289,0.6236,1.3696,2.0598,3.4325,1.9913,4.9324,4.1526,0.758,4.3109,3.7514,6.5744,0.9601,5.2516,5.0074,1.2504,2.1454,1.3719,1.8747,5.1884,0.9313,7.7451,2.7722,5.285,2.4225,5.8061,1.2211,4.1378,5.5324,1.8193,2.2624,1.6677,4.5255,0.4678,4.4952,5.3833,5.203,1.2711,3.0796,3.1688,3.5907,3.9693,0.7536,5.5031,1.9612,1.031,0.6733,0.0001,1.8327,1.7825,3.5138,4.6985,4.5777,1.3442,0.9689,5.8578,1.7179,1.6314,3.3104,0.0011,3.3544,0.9687,0.5997,0.0978,1.9152,4.519,5.7713,1.9971,6.9856,2.9038,1.9156,1.804,4.0306,5.0246,1.3317,1.2573,3.6762,0.8302,1.0643,0.0001,4.7769,0.5278,4.0502,0.4458,0.3627,0.4343,1.92,0.2341,5.3691,3.5215,0.4432,0.9355,1.3907,5.6944,0.7437,2.4204,2.3408,3.5236,0.3951,0.6662,1.3034,0.1738,3.545,3.0385,0.7307,3.094,0.339,0.77,3.0768,3.2143,0.7102,2.7114,2.2637,2.1591,4.9303,1.4517,1.2056,0.1765,1.7216,3.1956,0.3328,0.9492,5.3781,1.1739,4.3486,2.4704,6.033,2.8157,5.3501,3.7508,1.5446,1.4043,0.3583,0.0001,5.7362,1.4407,4.7356,0.2311,0.0078,0.0255,0.5236,1.792,0.4893,3.3457,1.37,2.3062,3.2065,1.6084,0.9101,0.8299,3.4001,0.3208,0.6237,1.6174,0.0001,1.6933,2.8312,1.6697,2.3893,5.0469,0.9474,3.4931,0.9939,6.718,2.4977,5.9724,1.3832,3.5483,0.7596,1.6717,4.337,1.0698,4.3838,1.424,5.1524,3.9539,5.0199,1.7822,4.4022,1.933,1.4831,6.2957,2.4483,3.2636,3.9417,0.0009,0.0019,0.3858,2.6848,0.64,3.595,4.0249,1.2944,0.2747,0.0596,2.7843,4.7,0.0036,1.3838,1.8032,1.2659,0.4165,0.0001,5.2516,4.9611,4.4772,1.1637,3.3174,5.9842,1.4397,6.0824,0.0048,3.4227,1.8299,5.9035,4.1055,4.5937,4.0911,0.4661,0.3301,1.767,0.9577,0.9396,0.0001,4.2206,7.1295,3.1693,0.0794,1.2609,5.7608,6.4144,5.491,1.3857,5.0169,1.0423,2.6845,0.0407,1.4491,3.1675,1.3578,2.6658,0.9838,6.3589,5.7805,4.8618,5.4899,4.6079,0.6721,2.5232,1.8637,5.567,1.4599,2.689,1.7761,5.3678,2.0848,3.7815,4.1302,1.1007,0.4767,3.835,2.0242,1.2961,1.0604,3.0276,3.0892,2.9814,4.6959,3.406,2.2114,6.646,2.326,6.0185,7.9211,0.1793]}
{"id":4285,"ended":true,"length":627,"text":"The world is ________. [ WP ] _______________________________________ _______________________________________\n\nI. What do you think about life?\n\nI am pretty happy, I am working a lot (3 hours a day) with the same skills as before. It really gets you involved in life.\n\nII. Where do you live?\n\nI live in Switzerland, where everything is free, everywhere is open. There are no barriers and nothing is too old and old. In Germany there is one place which is very popular. I am also very satisfied with everything (i.e. the food, the music).\n\nIII. How often do you work as your manager?\n\nEvery day I work there and work at a lot of places. I live a very busy lifestyle.\n\nIV. How much is it paid for the hour?\n\nIt's very low. I use that money to buy food, clothes, shoes, hair and makeup and to do other things with the money.\n\nV. Is there any good opportunity to work and work for a real company (for example, how big is a firm like yours)?\n\nIt is a very important company for me and as long I work there (i.e. 10 months every 3 months) my employer gives me a lot of good opportunities. I have a lot of friends who work at this company and I have many good friends who do business there. My friend is very much happy for the company and I have always always liked to work there.\n\nVI. How many children do you have?\n\nAt the moment I have three boys: two girls and two boys. Sometimes I also have 3 children.\n\nVII. What happens when you are at a leisure?\n\nI tend to play a lot. When I am at the weekends I go to visit my dad. I love it too.\n\nV. What does it cost to be a manager in any industry?\n\nIt depends on the people. They can raise money. In general it is expensive. Also, most of the people who work in the business don't have any experience at business so it is very difficult for them to become managers.\n\nVIII. Which type of company do you work for?\n\nFor example, a company that makes a lot of money for a long time. My company makes almost 50% of its sales through software.\n\nIV. What do you do every day at work?\n\nI love sports or whatever I work on. In the long run it makes my career so better.\n\nVii. Which career are you most excited to work for?\n\nI am really happy at the moment to be working for the company as an individual. I love it.\n\nViii. What do you think of the world order?\n\nThe world order is almost like a mirror image of the one we are living in.\n\nIX. In what world will you be the happiest and where will you be the most sad?\n\nI think we all like to live and enjoy ourselves. We know this as \"the end of the world\". I know this. I also know this, that things happen to good people.\n\nBut if we all agree, I think this world will stay where it is. It will not end because the world is really not the ending itself.","token_len":692,"entropy":[6.1108,1.7537,9.8724,3.6117,3.2523,5.0573,12.8106,1.1973,3.8667,3.6628,2.9901,2.2855,1.3141,0.2828,3.3534,0.0815,4.2178,5.17,4.0729,3.0379,1.1655,1.0927,1.3387,8.2532,2.4694,0.933,0.0003,1.9682,2.2595,5.2971,3.6893,2.8392,2.1263,1.5241,5.7512,3.282,0.7146,4.6324,6.1189,2.8071,0.4162,0.6448,1.5611,4.2004,3.3334,3.4992,5.921,1.4578,3.8949,1.0241,3.9829,4.9909,5.2114,4.9646,6.185,0.7165,2.5075,0.9901,1.3976,0.0002,1.2506,0.002,4.492,0.548,0.0669,1.9907,0.3582,0.0933,0.0002,0.7023,0.7518,0.4193,5.4969,1.3503,3.7142,4.7162,0.4289,3.1187,1.9365,6.6794,2.1038,3.1669,1.4433,3.6596,0.9143,1.5891,4.8622,3.8881,3.9428,1.1776,3.4297,6.2424,3.6652,3.9775,0.9784,4.7758,4.7833,2.348,0.8779,4.923,4.3706,4.069,0.8746,2.8739,4.6432,1.6859,2.2375,2.3112,3.8165,2.4501,4.9748,0.6855,3.6226,4.0669,5.0749,0.153,0.0021,0.2642,2.9194,3.6146,0.8678,1.0642,3.7328,2.6289,0.8279,0.0002,0.0939,0.0013,2.301,3.741,0.2062,0.0171,2.951,5.5551,5.5198,3.9667,0.1958,0.1001,0.0002,2.4487,0.696,1.2207,1.3836,5.5646,3.0542,4.0159,3.1614,2.798,3.4275,0.6253,1.7858,0.6018,1.2537,4.7653,3.0208,2.054,3.1933,2.8909,0.8134,1.4092,0.0002,0.0662,0.0011,1.9579,1.9239,3.5804,1.7836,2.8943,1.093,4.8811,6.9435,0.8834,0.0728,0.0004,1.3364,2.378,3.3436,2.1955,0.8999,1.53,4.8694,5.7447,0.8598,1.0633,1.1318,2.625,0.9928,1.4727,0.5842,3.4895,0.7147,6.5045,1.508,4.0476,3.0277,2.4766,3.1318,2.1058,0.4009,4.8327,2.1599,0.6122,0.5424,0.9415,0.0002,0.1831,0.0014,3.77,0.5521,1.4118,5.1252,7.0123,0.897,1.242,4.6293,3.5831,2.4709,2.3921,6.1703,1.9933,3.6691,3.6877,0.6669,0.9569,6.6504,4.4389,0.8035,2.3475,4.1616,3.5621,5.3832,2.8804,0.0503,0.0003,2.7524,1.7575,2.7316,1.5539,3.6192,2.7809,3.0568,0.285,2.654,5.7388,1.864,4.2262,1.571,0.9295,4.3683,2.6842,0.0188,0.0016,0.0819,5.8322,4.5493,5.8628,4.1883,1.1301,1.112,3.2847,5.1972,4.1175,0.1712,1.4024,1.7627,0.2348,3.5718,1.5348,0.7222,2.165,2.4441,1.9987,1.3763,0.088,2.341,1.5165,0.8611,2.3926,4.5812,0.67,1.3034,1.696,2.047,3.0304,2.0861,1.6152,0.9082,3.989,3.2238,1.6948,0.6558,4.5903,4.3465,2.1572,3.1835,4.8953,3.4547,3.4758,3.5567,1.2859,1.0152,1.7225,2.242,3.8483,5.8523,2.8003,3.4047,0.3723,0.6851,0.331,0.5038,0.0002,0.3895,0.0013,1.9328,2.3778,5.2089,0.3488,0.0138,0.1482,0.3411,0.06,0.0003,5.1951,1.9928,0.9901,1.1268,0.4669,3.1371,4.1188,4.1135,3.105,1.9431,0.5568,1.6786,0.106,0.545,6.8295,0.84,3.8392,0.3954,4.191,2.4821,1.0092,0.7702,0.0002,0.0506,0.001,1.1346,4.4564,1.3147,0.4706,2.2837,4.1227,1.8501,8.3288,4.9387,0.1104,0.0004,0.898,6.557,0.0567,4.9708,2.0218,0.1129,1.6816,3.6109,0.2104,0.987,0.7492,2.9597,6.8511,0.7773,3.1477,0.4079,6.2229,0.6167,5.1671,1.3007,1.6108,4.393,2.4356,4.8893,0.6963,0.7383,0.0003,0.2368,7.4122,1.1417,2.9413,1.394,1.9145,0.4309,2.5644,1.0168,2.1652,2.3996,5.4641,2.5391,0.2685,0.0272,0.0003,1.1342,2.7726,0.5764,0.8831,5.6877,1.5536,5.0267,2.6577,6.8958,1.814,3.6417,4.3021,3.3459,2.0326,0.7895,4.2092,1.4702,5.3597,1.5689,4.0514,1.3754,0.4654,1.8288,1.7508,0.7072,1.8264,1.2568,2.3291,3.1111,0.0017,1.4481,1.4604,2.5621,3.771,6.3868,4.0265,1.6947,0.737,1.7324,1.7549,1.7084,0.2454,0.4191,3.4753,0.4851,0.286,0.5975,0.0003,0.5713,0.0092,0.0013,4.4652,4.4472,0.0142,1.8501,0.8087,0.005,0.9894,0.8297,0.1882,0.0347,0.0002,4.5116,1.4368,0.5349,2.7148,1.9018,2.0549,3.6595,3.0594,0.8878,0.0178,0.7714,4.069,2.4712,2.0844,0.1871,1.0095,5.318,1.5076,3.4717,5.0062,3.5664,0.6351,0.3116,1.493,3.9454,3.4566,5.2758,1.0021,1.1321,0.0003,2.5974,0.0013,1.0449,2.139,0.0398,1.1667,3.9286,0.1305,4.8478,0.8408,0.1269,0.0419,0.0003,0.6052,5.507,7.0734,5.206,4.3421,2.3584,3.9275,0.884,0.5023,4.0617,1.6778,5.3036,1.0318,2.0676,3.6475,2.4729,4.6123,4.9371,5.528,0.4107,0.7559,0.0003,0.6072,7.3131,0.0055,3.5839,5.6145,2.3528,0.0162,2.9865,2.5774,1.8834,3.5113,0.6777,0.2036,0.0265,0.0003,0.6951,1.1137,3.4713,1.113,2.6165,1.4361,0.5708,4.6,1.1738,1.7278,1.0498,2.8404,1.0959,4.4535,3.9105,3.5144,0.4706,1.1294,2.7321,2.8502,1.6309,0.6308,0.0003,0.1697,0.1536,0.0017,0.8985,1.5943,0.0169,1.3057,2.0395,1.1204,3.6197,7.683,0.5508,0.1113,0.0003,2.2538,0.4538,1.3398,0.3627,6.456,2.2666,1.0687,5.0579,2.3295,0.454,1.4648,3.7014,1.245,2.6302,1.1769,0.1006,0.7253,3.0762,0.0003,1.3448,0.0019,5.3634,0.7637,5.0665,5.0087,0.533,1.414,4.5185,3.6711,3.2698,4.6866,1.2406,0.1758,1.0287,2.0185,2.3099,3.7897,0.1589,0.0272,0.0003,0.6768,3.4074,3.5746,3.3279,3.8624,0.7785,0.9525,3.9958,4.1577,2.6118,0.8047,2.5211,4.7963,3.7606,4.3306,4.8375,2.5565,5.2874,0.3799,1.0182,0.0497,0.5963,2.4546,4.0665,1.978,5.6833,1.6851,3.0216,0.675,1.7081,4.1555,2.1114,5.7132,4.7763,2.2414,4.0603,0.1407,1.1902,0.9534,0.0003,7.7939,3.5827,1.6115,3.3058,4.9213,2.2311,2.7968,1.6854,3.0305,1.1874,1.1633,5.6612,5.2363,0.3343,0.128,0.8355,2.9779,0.5023,2.5141,3.8106,4.1172,3.0215,0.9667,1.1367,4.8273,4.054,2.9234,6.2549,6.3531,0.3933]}
{"id":982,"ended":true,"length":669,"text":"An ignored office worker who is about to realise that he's not a ghost, it's just that no one likes him.' - A former worker, former president of an organisation who has a'sick habit of trying to hide his own face' while he has no family around him, is having a nightmare about leaving office.\nThe former head of the Ghana Immigration Service said the incident was recorded by his colleagues on the radio after he got out of bed, and said the woman would make jokes about how the office worker is a ghost and that he was trying to look as \"shabby as possible\".\nThe former employee's employer said the man was \"not the ghost but had the bad habit because everything was in his eyes. He was not as friendly as he thought\".\nSaying the incident had come to light, the former employee added: \"He said that they didn't know him and that he was the ghost. All that is in his eyes, he is trying to look as shabby as possible. He also said that he was just trying to give something back.\n\"I know that some people may have taken some personal attention but some people do not like him.\"\nThe Ghana Immigration Service has taken the initiative to ensure that the employer, particularly the current head of the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS), is able to hide the fact that they have not actually recognised him, he added.\nThe Ghana Immigration Service (GIS) has taken the initiative to ensure that the employer, particularly the current head of the Ghana Immigration Service (GOIS), is able to hide the fact that they have not actually recognised him.\nAt a recent interaction between the GIS and a former staff of the Executive Branch of the government who spoke on anonymity, the GIS boss made it clear that he has no intention of taking a break.\n\"I had no intention of taking a break,\" stated Mr. G. Ihco, GIS General Manager (CEO) at Ghana Immigration Service.\nHe said the agency had no intentions to take a break even once upon a time and said no staff members had even considered taking breaks on behalf of the GIS.\n\"They have taken the initiative and implemented some new measures which would ensure that we achieve our best and we are very proud of that.\"\nGIS boss said he has not met the head at the company, explaining, \"He hasn't met the current head of the office. We were going out to visit him, and it was a very stressful trip.\"\nThe former employee said that he was told that the employer is one of the main people who makes the boss pay attention to him.\n\"If the boss pays attention, then you can get his attention,\" stated the former employee. \"I am sure that he is the boss of the office, which means that I am responsible for making the boss pay attention.\"\nThe GIS boss said the office has implemented some new measures and implemented a number of new policies to ensure that no employee in the office is able to change the person that they see as the ghost.\n\"No, we have not seen them for more than a couple of years,\" stated the GIS boss which means that GIS officers will be able to find out the person who they saw as the ghost of the office workers, adding that they were very happy about the fact that they had already established a relationship with the office.","token_len":692,"entropy":[11.1181,9.5936,3.0962,2.8745,3.1596,5.3667,0.2365,10.9385,1.5626,1.7471,2.3531,2.8894,2.5931,6.7478,2.1922,5.1944,0.7746,4.5876,2.6266,4.6503,0.327,4.5994,0.8259,6.1253,5.509,4.8846,3.4971,4.7683,2.9433,5.2204,6.5588,0.6608,4.177,2.8609,2.9604,2.2658,4.0325,11.9603,11.1841,5.1658,0.9958,5.1549,0.1149,3.4884,1.2203,2.966,5.041,6.1462,8.2535,2.3811,4.0397,4.1039,5.4185,4.0917,1.7106,1.8317,3.8051,5.0613,1.2141,3.7477,3.0987,6.552,5.5706,0.8978,1.5294,10.0868,2.6823,3.8978,0.0679,1.1261,9.2082,6.7178,1.1083,2.8375,2.6715,4.9525,1.6669,6.654,1.5398,2.411,3.9934,2.4414,1.8318,5.9485,4.9691,1.1548,3.7811,2.761,0.5668,3.6095,2.8932,2.0907,3.866,2.5596,4.2941,4.3967,4.4809,4.3721,0.4871,2.7939,3.342,3.1205,0.615,4.1422,1.8836,0.768,2.8061,2.0247,1.2362,1.8875,3.95,0.0443,5.4885,4.1497,4.5369,6.4194,1.8287,0.9334,0.3106,0.435,0.355,2.0991,2.4373,2.7384,4.267,5.0439,2.1242,1.506,2.8331,1.4976,2.9001,3.7161,3.5295,4.5174,3.5161,6.6617,2.7938,6.0828,1.5957,9.7409,6.878,2.1043,4.1938,0.9771,4.8902,3.4469,1.3323,1.1799,3.5408,5.2201,4.0077,0.5411,0.8275,3.0651,2.8238,0.2878,6.6302,4.3257,1.6673,2.1345,2.2389,4.3758,0.8372,0.6776,1.7453,0.8556,2.2937,1.3555,3.7222,0.2988,1.093,1.714,3.5751,2.3097,4.2686,3.76,0.0006,1.7984,3.2348,1.8294,1.6208,0.7711,0.9583,3.9111,1.0827,1.338,5.3745,3.4841,3.356,2.8821,0.294,0.7047,2.6498,1.557,1.8258,4.2044,0.032,0.4914,0.8641,1.489,0.0013,0.0107,0.0073,1.0468,1.5698,4.7691,0.8554,0.4324,0.7814,1.5438,4.338,0.9902,0.0244,5.5932,3.8256,0.3808,2.4211,1.3961,1.4195,2.3555,3.9869,1.3728,3.8476,0.5904,3.9634,2.4507,4.7798,4.75,5.1626,6.5226,2.9331,5.2892,0.6909,3.7985,0.1696,1.9128,1.3183,2.3348,0.2106,1.4773,4.9605,0.8294,0.0208,2.4384,4.6279,1.7528,6.8295,0.1591,4.5326,1.0377,1.8327,6.1962,4.0088,7.8163,1.6172,4.4671,0.5546,0.3591,0.3405,3.8917,0.2352,0.0135,2.6509,1.2416,0.7349,0.2766,1.3473,3.8511,0.0162,6.8776,2.0147,3.1661,0.2531,2.7265,1.5143,3.4596,5.7502,4.9521,0.8533,2.8487,2.814,0.6691,0.032,0.245,1.4241,4.6769,0.2026,0.0083,2.1648,0.2788,0.0449,0.184,1.5149,2.639,0.141,0.1146,0.0222,0.0077,0.0234,0.0801,0.0688,0.0236,0.0184,0.0038,0.0086,0.004,0.0008,0.0016,0.5246,0.0027,0.0053,0.0305,10.0718,2.2864,0.069,0.0187,0.0032,0.0008,0.027,0.0138,0.002,0.0027,0.0069,0.0042,0.0038,0.0017,0.0073,0.0059,3.0051,0.7886,5.6048,2.1122,3.2675,9.2532,2.1042,1.1861,2.2358,0.0081,0.3835,2.2433,1.6392,4.1024,6.4825,1.1033,7.1477,3.2916,2.0954,0.3887,2.978,7.2897,4.324,0.5464,5.3508,0.7047,0.9481,3.3582,0.0056,4.797,5.1563,1.6522,0.0868,0.3439,1.1172,3.6101,0.8617,2.1722,0.0508,4.2649,3.4516,4.8295,1.718,0.4528,1.4773,1.2927,4.784,2.2523,0.9928,0.3714,2.6803,0.3571,0.1205,2.0292,7.009,3.6128,2.8717,3.2577,5.7583,4.9711,5.4652,8.9029,1.546,5.4052,0.0403,6.8474,0.5206,4.8716,5.3671,1.1504,2.3123,4.8683,0.849,0.1218,0.7566,1.1098,1.8565,1.3916,2.0265,3.6011,1.7718,3.1912,4.9809,1.9864,1.8906,0.5611,0.2058,5.0704,5.3195,7.1422,0.9739,0.0265,2.0367,3.7918,5.4203,3.9387,2.2536,1.5706,3.5279,3.7831,1.8085,4.2519,4.0918,5.9696,0.0036,0.6694,2.2359,0.0036,0.7077,0.2831,1.2205,3.2388,2.2201,3.2967,2.3989,1.4143,2.2412,6.4847,3.892,3.675,2.565,3.134,4.9081,3.5233,0.4051,2.0091,7.4951,0.9973,4.9688,3.143,3.5092,2.0782,3.8786,2.2901,0.3353,1.651,3.165,0.1525,3.091,0.2024,4.6557,3.0098,1.4672,2.4685,2.6522,5.0902,1.1558,4.1346,6.1594,0.946,4.643,2.1147,6.7367,3.8308,0.1355,2.8077,4.7017,0.0006,2.1374,1.5612,4.8344,0.4488,1.6411,0.2882,4.1195,1.6668,2.0043,4.2103,4.6507,4.8315,1.3971,4.2336,1.3955,2.4202,2.2895,3.3896,0.8157,2.4936,1.9177,6.1962,4.0545,1.7812,0.1573,1.709,1.3377,1.5414,1.2613,1.5644,1.2672,1.6798,3.2038,1.507,1.2236,5.7276,3.6111,6.6075,0.1284,0.4325,3.9634,4.7062,1.2279,5.2761,1.8089,6.8527,4.0397,4.8842,0.8244,1.4623,0.8936,0.4975,0.8843,3.9739,2.653,1.4402,4.5564,0.0818,1.5805,1.9296,3.011,1.8061,3.3679,3.8294,0.1228,1.5104,5.0578,0.2853,0.197,0.1824,0.239,1.4362,2.5763,2.6762,2.4109,0.7227,1.7304,1.9514,2.9842,2.5162,2.0484,0.7873,1.1625,1.7101,3.9819,1.9673,0.629,4.1966,1.2785,3.6919,0.1929,4.3302,2.6834,0.4006,0.165,0.0372,2.0214,0.1348,1.4085,2.7661,0.0056,0.7868,0.7863,2.4378,4.5689,2.0023,5.1406,1.183,0.3982,0.4327,3.1316,5.8158,1.9062,3.1727,0.0178,1.7587,2.7978,1.8495,0.8812,0.3026,3.8026,3.8443,4.5746,0.4797,0.9999,1.2323,4.7564,0.0042,5.4996,2.0099,5.5605,4.5492,1.6937,4.2985,0.9693,1.4725,0.415,0.5372,0.257,1.2037,5.2816,5.1185,1.64,1.199,1.577,4.2457,4.2214,4.9264,4.2094,0.0026,1.2063,2.4721,0.0169,2.4742,1.5807,1.7805,0.3876,1.5517,0.0019,0.0599,8.7781,5.5006,0.4725,4.6161,0.0735,4.7223,2.9276,1.8915,1.9685,0.0222,4.8632,1.0605,2.6466,1.8224,1.976,1.8201,3.8524,0.5737,0.3295,0.1399,3.4557,1.0966,2.0891,5.7722,2.5307,3.7112,0.3877,1.8583,3.7653,4.6378,2.632,3.1814,1.0549,3.0327,0.0506,1.5069,1.8401,5.0864,4.9332,1.9847,1.6118,0.2504,0.4976,3.1502,1.6078]}
{"id":3556,"ended":false,"length":670,"text":"`` Looking for answers in the pouring rain. '''`''> The weather yesterday turned chilly. Not sure a rain jacket had been found, but it might have been, if they had.\nIt also kept us out of the rain for an hour. It was raining hard and heavy for those of us who had never been outside. The rain got worse after a couple of hours, but nothing like the flooding this spring.\nThis is one thing, but the rain that started in the early morning was so heavy that we only put on a blanket for about an hour before the wind got stronger. It was very hot in there and the humidity in the building was very high. There wasn't a shirt you could see out of the window unless you were wearing shoes, but a few people out drinking water ran out of the building shortly before the sun came up.\nIf we had stayed outside, we'd have been right behind all of the victims. The rain would have stayed below that fog line with the wind. As for what happened tonight, well, we didn't have to worry about that. At least we can tell that it was a violent storm; I got to enjoy the view, but it was a real sight to see. A few of their cars were torn up and it didn't seem like the whole town was that affected. It's a beautiful sight right now.\nThe man who drove down this side of town was just right. He didn't turn the lights off completely at first, and then the wind was getting a bit stronger. He said it was a nice afternoon, and that it was actually a nice day to take in.\nThen this young man got into some trouble too. A couple of times, he got out of the car early and went into the backseat. When he woke up, the wind changed the car. We weren\u2019t sure exactly what it was he was doing. He walked out of the car and the wind changed his behavior. It\u2019s weird. This was no ordinary car.\nThe man who drove over the bridge got into it during the coldest month of the year.\nWhat was the problem with it? It\u2019s not as cold as we normally see it. But it got colder this year, too. Some of the fog was a little heavy.\nThat makes it a tough time of year to try and locate any equipment that can help us in a dangerous weather like this. We\u2019ve been using the internet a lot more than we had before and it's making every little bit of the weather nicer. What better way to put this than to let people know what's going on?\nThis was the one place that gave us hope. We drove over here to get there with a friend. We were the only ones out of here that were out there in the fog and we didn't see anything.\nWe drove through all the rain and the fog, but the only thing that really made the weather better was that the lights were going on. What a relief it was for us tonight. The rain was really nice and the sun was shining.\nFor now, we all wait for someone to make the proper order for our lunch. Tomorrow is our feast day, so what are you waiting for?\nThat would be my friend, Mr. J. L. Anderson. Thank you so much.\n--Dan\nRelated Stories:","token_len":693,"entropy":[10.7908,1.0548,5.6196,4.0172,1.3687,10.8121,0.3409,2.3464,6.4753,6.7295,6.8088,4.5166,8.3182,4.1688,5.4605,7.3102,4.2707,3.8678,1.3807,6.0454,3.9358,7.2261,3.6202,4.6706,4.1863,1.5194,3.1065,2.1162,0.5794,1.853,4.9415,1.0964,0.4588,4.0078,2.9445,3.0827,1.0276,2.0683,4.2023,6.7809,6.0396,5.8014,3.4096,3.5321,0.4553,0.9176,2.5614,2.0835,3.5062,0.3399,1.3765,2.6214,0.9642,3.3487,3.0011,2.1033,3.4452,4.4667,5.2686,3.5555,0.0647,0.9852,2.0423,3.7617,1.0499,2.526,1.6413,2.2815,2.5044,4.8757,3.369,3.8256,2.4501,2.3377,0.1964,0.5469,1.4052,1.5814,4.8324,3.4381,1.5919,6.5518,4.9711,5.6095,0.5605,1.9759,4.1892,2.6581,3.879,3.7555,3.4895,1.4163,2.7745,3.3964,3.7794,3.8841,2.633,1.5221,3.2308,0.5919,1.8619,2.3825,2.2127,0.8878,1.908,5.1747,7.1411,1.9584,1.4934,5.1347,2.0766,2.4292,1.6315,0.0058,2.0289,2.0752,3.6975,4.0657,2.3422,0.5681,2.4419,0.9788,4.0915,3.37,2.8986,3.6007,1.9051,2.3833,4.3386,3.5653,1.2813,4.0029,0.7777,2.7404,0.3973,0.35,3.6735,3.5189,0.0007,2.0597,8.1095,6.2966,0.2567,3.4703,3.9219,1.3592,0.4246,1.1748,6.8244,0.1896,1.3799,3.1269,5.4584,1.9917,1.8596,4.5257,2.7367,2.2794,6.1628,7.3748,3.1804,5.7936,1.9865,0.7743,1.5505,0.7491,6.3113,1.6767,1.4292,4.2946,1.7382,0.2627,0.369,1.0109,4.7931,2.2244,1.2961,2.7774,1.8224,1.2878,0.9114,2.5034,0.5861,1.461,6.277,3.8447,5.2822,1.6461,1.5192,7.0294,0.9682,2.3476,3.3837,2.9013,0.1337,4.9868,5.4425,3.5479,8.551,4.5678,5.2958,1.4201,2.1332,2.1936,4.7978,2.861,3.8449,1.6062,5.5667,0.2028,5.2443,0.3121,1.7807,2.2972,0.0005,2.5925,2.0686,1.5256,0.6015,1.2753,0.7385,5.5254,0.4619,1.2954,4.9224,4.5532,2.3147,2.2085,1.0387,2.1705,7.5718,1.2438,5.9602,3.8611,5.5222,2.8985,5.2846,0.952,2.0696,3.3131,1.777,1.9056,0.8633,2.4871,4.9517,3.9534,0.8928,0.753,0.7601,4.9048,2.6265,2.1953,7.1275,4.4078,0.8309,5.1036,2.0394,1.7861,4.5046,4.3344,0.0006,2.5167,0.7067,2.5777,4.0215,3.0885,0.4576,5.496,4.3364,0.7579,2.916,2.6697,2.1562,3.7247,2.4793,5.0434,1.3633,0.8171,0.7311,2.0594,5.6592,1.1566,4.0111,3.9005,4.7544,2.9701,0.1152,3.212,1.5013,4.2687,6.0442,3.1592,1.1346,3.9213,0.0006,5.3686,3.1347,3.0275,1.0016,5.2669,4.5888,2.312,0.6349,3.0478,2.4861,2.8141,3.1681,3.4575,4.2709,3.5144,1.4513,1.003,0.6596,1.6889,3.6343,2.2707,0.7115,2.1643,3.3795,4.4393,1.381,1.2208,2.1487,1.7638,0.6421,5.2325,2.2056,1.6934,0.7757,2.1363,6.0497,1.9858,2.9841,1.7367,5.4099,5.1862,5.5447,0.7243,3.2173,3.2814,4.2164,1.2632,5.3694,0.2993,4.1843,2.3434,0.1312,3.3869,1.8874,0.7091,2.9046,2.965,0.3163,0.9582,0.5998,6.7687,0.9241,3.7181,2.0675,0.6747,2.7808,3.0672,0.9926,3.7504,0.5029,5.982,0.0829,0.5306,2.3949,2.4912,6.1474,3.8562,4.1675,3.1273,4.0826,4.2939,16.5624,8.4105,1.0974,1.5888,4.1454,0.4385,2.5963,0.1093,5.0755,0.2197,0.9943,1.7733,2.0104,5.3299,2.2743,0.7567,0.1194,0.4696,1.036,3.8759,1.2089,2.6456,1.6116,5.2467,0.7579,2.3848,10.8311,0.2745,1.246,4.7296,1.9119,4.8391,2.2641,5.4099,1.5991,2.4071,0.9849,2.2119,2.128,2.0999,1.5323,0.9906,4.0846,2.2846,3.4046,3.322,1.1681,5.3836,5.7564,0.4592,5.0365,3.3859,5.7699,0.4575,0.7629,0.2007,0.4939,3.3824,4.7939,2.5943,2.232,4.1162,2.0327,3.2476,0.1721,2.4488,4.4172,0.146,0.0823,2.2084,3.9725,2.1516,0.1084,2.454,4.4149,2.6365,1.1469,0.7831,3.9206,1.1798,4.5305,3.1832,4.579,1.783,1.53,3.7713,0.2516,5.7572,1.2631,0.4952,7.4803,1.6052,4.4059,0.8561,4.2766,1.9461,2.0513,4.1453,5.6115,1.4358,2.3879,6.1532,4.4057,5.1925,0.7313,1.6349,5.9782,0.7498,6.0321,3.6223,8.8685,2.2455,4.2124,1.0067,2.385,3.1713,3.623,4.9073,3.0958,4.6749,0.2126,0.1887,2.4208,7.561,0.6212,1.6319,1.4911,3.8124,2.5804,5.2094,1.9346,0.2898,4.8698,1.5638,1.2934,3.5055,1.6349,3.0473,2.3823,2.4121,5.541,6.4321,3.5499,1.2947,0.7222,5.7289,4.2856,7.5859,0.6314,5.8054,4.2651,0.3774,0.1352,4.706,2.8172,2.6763,1.2455,4.8672,1.8369,0.528,1.9999,1.5458,0.6174,0.0492,1.0799,0.6798,3.3265,2.0799,1.9077,4.5296,1.6455,1.7434,4.7453,0.4933,3.8059,0.7681,1.9128,5.8834,2.6984,3.2587,2.7295,2.3176,5.7916,5.2997,1.9809,1.7047,1.2574,1.4561,2.2739,5.3886,0.4345,1.0805,2.8907,1.5939,3.6005,1.8759,2.0336,3.0985,2.682,2.9486,0.7127,5.0408,2.5348,2.7647,2.4188,0.2301,2.6925,1.6667,0.8939,1.8539,1.8698,2.5348,2.7181,4.3574,0.7947,5.3263,1.4306,2.5588,3.0637,2.187,2.2005,2.485,3.0633,0.7104,0.9029,3.103,2.3921,3.0385,3.5902,1.9816,0.2188,1.8936,1.6202,4.9296,1.2384,4.1229,2.0003,0.9728,5.5537,2.3297,2.134,2.5154,0.5018,4.3225,0.8407,7.6014,0.4211,2.6288,2.8845,1.1125,2.9198,3.4814,1.6712,2.0652,3.4075,0.4139,1.3715,1.7462,1.4159,5.3625,3.4941,0.3037,0.7104,4.887,5.2557,0.7422,4.4068,0.2706,5.0871,2.4575,6.5686,5.5195,1.5384,2.5256,4.9996,0.6035,6.1818,1.9616,3.428,6.1613,0.6483,1.4714,0.9183,5.7622,3.3182,1.1114,0.7556,0.0187,0.2166,0.7672,4.6793,4.1511,0.3518,3.0519,3.2075,1.7825,4.6222,0.1122,4.961,1.3083,5.3351,0.6294,5.792,0.3689,4.9433,0.036,1.2307,0.0151,1.8838,1.0162,6.251,8.9957,1.5601,7.2761,3.3765,1.1344]}

A nurse walks out and sees the paper you're holding in your hands, with all of the accomplishments you've done. She then asks you, `` So what was your favorite task you crossed off? ''`'\n\nYou'd like to help another doctor help you write an essay? That's right... we're working on it! Your question is simple... What was your favorite job that you had as a child and why? Did you have to do anything to help people or be successful to be at that job? What would you like to accomplish with your job during your time in Washington DC?\n\nI worked in Washington for the last 13 years -- and in most areas, both jobs were really important, but more so in Washington D.C. It was a very special place in my life because it allowed me to live in a huge, community and work for a real company and it gave me an opportunity to develop my skills and abilities. I just enjoy working -- I feel like I learned as a result of my work. When I worked for a company that supported me for 25 years, there were a lot of people out there -- both in Washington and in my immediate community. I just really love working for a company like that, and I think working for a company like that really makes me appreciate being in Washington a lot.\n\nI've also loved working in Washington D.C. because of the incredible people and the people there. They're really great people, and it makes me very happy to be a part of the culture. They have a really good work ethic -- they're not afraid to talk, and they're honest with customers of all types -- which is really rare in Washington, D.C. -- and they're very kind and very loving people. I just think that having people that support me who believe in me, who love me who believe in me is super important to me. I think it helps me be able to work in Washington D.C. and not just enjoy things in Washington D.C. but also appreciate what I do -- which is just as important to me because I feel like Washington makes it incredibly special to work here and it should make any place very special to me in a way that I don't know how or how.\n\nIf you have a question for us about your work, feel free to ask about it!\n\nComments\n\nThe only problem is, you can get fired for anything and everyone will look back with wonder how you were able to do this. That's the only way you can get dismissed. I know they are different jobs but it can't be that hard to get away from work, you just gotta be diligent. Just go for it.

{"id":722,"ended":false,"length":609,"text":"A man from Canada decides to break into the United States. Tell his daring tale.\n\nThe man who broke into the US via telephone in a bid to grab an iPhone, the perpetrator said, was from Texas while he was studying an online course for his university.\n\nJason Lefebvre, 37 years old, had planned to visit the UK for a weekend but the suspect apparently wanted to visit America first.\n\nLefebvre said: \"This is one of my favourite times and I've never once gone to one of those places and only two years old.\"\n\n\"When I had left I was very surprised but had to turn round because everything was broken.\"\n\nFailed to enter the United States, the man has admitted to breaking into a bank, using stolen money and a phone to make a few hundred dollars more than he hoped.\n\nHe is being held at Fort Lauderdale Jail in Broward County, Florida.\n\nLast night, Lefebvre was walking to his hometown of Ticonderoga when the suspect appeared and demanded money from him, according to reports.\n\nDuring the moment of the break-in, Lefebvre asked where Lefebvre was going to school and where he was going to spend the weekend, according to a report from the Toronto Sun.\n\nAfter waiting in line for more than ten minutes, Lefebvre was told that he needed to use the telephone for only nine hours.\n\n'Bout to make a little bit of that money-making'\n\n\"When the police said I was going to get a big amount by the way, I started to take the phone out of my pocket and said 'hey you wanna pay me off later so I can get back to school later,' \" Lefebvre said.\n\n\"They said 'no but you gotta go out and visit with dad'...

{"id":2123,"ended":true,"length":670,"text":"A 7 hour drive to your vacation home is far from routine, nevertheless you slip into autopilot. Upon arrival you find the TV on, accompanied by an eerie stillness. Reporters discuss a recent fatal accident on a local highway, you see your destroyed and barely recognizable vehicle onscreen. You have noticed on television, you are told that you will receive a pay raise. The next day you are greeted by a call from a colleague that was issued on-line, the same day that you are to be paid a raise of 50000 rupee. The pay increase comes not from the government\u2019s pay system, but from the private sector workers and their families. At the time of your request to the authorities, you are required to pay for your own travel expenses as well.\n\nSo which way is the wind up?\n\nOne important factor in choosing a vacation place is to have a sense of your options. An estimated 1.5 million citizens spend 12% of their income on vacations, but a typical person spends 30% of that time off work or in the field. You can choose that destination in most areas. You will be looking at what you can afford in terms of your own personal allowance, your salary, your retirement and all other expenses, or you can choose what you want to do to take advantage of vacation and your job. To keep in mind the main issue that one face when choosing a vacation spot is finding a place where you can spend as little as 2,000 rupees. If it\u2019s not possible to find a location in those areas that offers both home protection and time off work, it\u2019s not easy for many of the other attractions to be found.\n\n2. A vacation that\u2019s \u201ctoo risky\u201d\n\nHow many children do you have? How many hours of sleep each night do you get. What will you do with your life after you\u2019ve made many friends? The first thing that comes to your mind is to make the most of each of those. When you are ready to make the trip to visit your relatives or see the sights, it\u2019s a good idea to make plans and do all the legwork that is required for you to make plans. You can choose vacation planning which may be more expensive than you are used to during your last vacation, but remember that it could be any of many other destinations in which you would be happier as a result of your return from vacation. This can be a way of saving money at the start, and a way of staying motivated when you return for a long or short stay.\n\n3. You can take it in a different direction\n\nWhen it comes to your personal life, it is important not to turn into a gambler or a liar about the trip you plan. On the contrary, spend the time that you will need to research the local and local resources. When it comes to vacations, you can choose to spend as much time as you want in every part of your personal life and enjoy the experience. Of this, you will be more likely to enjoy it than you might be accustomed to doing. You will not be able to get bored easily, and you will be more likely to spend the time you spend on a vacation with your family and friends than before you vacation. This is probably the most important thing which you should be doing if you want to enjoy a vacation and give yourself extra time after you vacation is over.","token_len":705,"entropy":[7.3672,7.9773,3.1216,1.8584,4.2854,7.3083,1.2525,3.1663,5.7885,1.4454,7.1726,1.7694,10.6913,3.6038,10.7113,1.2728,8.3353,0.0057,2.4555,7.0682,1.7137,1.9737,3.4167,3.216,6.8294,2.7692,2.5211,8.622,0.0502,2.7741,5.7529,7.5281,0.7963,1.2599,10.1296,2.215,7.9201,3.4047,3.8164,7.0931,1.3292,2.5431,1.4967,5.3361,1.8249,1.3746,5.9414,4.4606,3.3345,11.1458,5.4486,5.9948,2.4118,2.6274,3.5586,8.0821,1.4447,1.7728,4.2749,7.1396,5.9028,4.4836,2.7046,2.8363,2.3044,5.1233,1.525,1.8676,3.2037,4.6409,1.0571,5.7458,1.681,1.5337,2.7061,3.1704,0.8666,0.8199,1.8117,4.3576,0.335,0.9525,5.4715,0.4591,1.3449,4.8115,3.9704,5.6773,5.9388,3.2173,5.0065,2.4566,2.2567,3.7453,3.6074,2.2552,1.6892,1.4189,2.9798,2.9526,2.1405,2.7847,2.5569,4.2576,4.0788,3.6624,7.3981,5.7575,4.2322,1.1013,2.1349,4.2801,2.5142,3.4096,5.5619,1.2492,1.2529,1.4807,15.4652,7.1224,5.6558,4.3455,3.0825,1.1348,0.1131,0.5432,0.9975,4.0549,0.3889,6.8567,4.1324,2.7626,2.3181,0.7147,4.8685,1.2522,2.8168,0.7843,2.8165,4.7311,2.675,2.2992,5.4061,0.5396,1.1528,1.679,4.6507,0.0654,1.6438,3.6309,1.5426,2.4486,3.2895,0.5946,3.8175,0.8611,1.9164,2.2708,0.1031,5.2143,6.3971,3.8873,1.2466,1.5065,5.0697,3.0095,1.2209,1.3043,0.0002,4.4868,6.3878,1.6007,2.246,2.397,1.4047,3.1541,6.5458,0.5012,2.638,2.9978,1.3615,4.0078,0.0489,3.2,6.1001,0.6851,5.7938,5.0748,2.8389,0.5222,1.3005,0.4954,5.292,4.7515,5.9835,4.6952,0.1657,0.0575,1.4597,0.1586,2.366,1.3715,3.4306,3.7625,4.9778,3.5783,1.4269,4.3622,0.4666,0.5161,2.3172,4.8976,5.9412,1.2978,2.9543,2.1181,1.6684,2.2286,0.4086,4.5996,2.0605,3.1263,6.3445,4.8369,2.8114,5.1301,5.2999,1.7377,3.2267,2.483,2.3248,5.2477,1.2057,5.186,2.2456,1.0695,1.6696,2.9491,2.0096,0.0013,3.0067,2.9371,2.936,4.905,1.1685,2.3615,3.8651,0.7485,1.2961,4.0439,2.1233,3.8936,2.0744,2.721,2.8042,4.7248,1.1901,0.2577,1.0208,3.8646,0.9988,1.4929,0.4293,1.0668,4.5213,4.4398,1.0834,0.0201,4.4168,4.3248,3.8627,5.573,1.7808,5.3605,4.6104,3.124,0.3293,2.34,5.0673,4.1886,3.6474,6.1522,6.0444,2.5163,0.9735,0.6723,0.1605,3.3528,0.2169,5.7381,1.4491,1.3253,2.4318,0.4187,0.55,2.6139,4.5126,1.8706,0.8243,4.5248,4.6425,0.4836,0.1512,0.1606,1.7217,3.3568,3.868,16.1215,0.4831,0.0116,1.8767,1.8412,0.6787,1.814,0.5826,4.4526,2.4367,6.8794,1.4723,4.0262,3.4345,5.3576,6.0233,6.7632,0.1682,6.3567,0.3946,1.6859,0.3652,2.6936,2.4508,0.1075,0.0218,1.9688,5.3497,3.5769,4.0834,2.8487,2.0437,5.1239,7.4017,2.1726,1.9529,2.4395,1.2188,0.9543,0.0002,5.6364,0.3358,4.3288,3.4669,5.3105,8.6016,0.2869,0.0151,13.3779,4.1279,6.264,5.5176,1.8489,5.8063,0.7369,0.0001,5.4312,2.5534,6.101,1.3216,0.1439,1.1674,1.1882,2.3962,0.2102,4.7442,2.2247,2.7423,6.2848,2.3326,1.4819,0.03,3.051,5.8283,2.307,4.7685,0.9258,0.7326,2.1679,1.4261,2.5692,2.8465,2.542,7.0698,0.4799,2.7942,4.4728,7.4272,3.699,1.1147,3.65,4.8244,1.6927,1.7726,1.7985,0.0356,3.366,0.0067,0.6924,2.8931,3.5634,3.0809,2.1256,0.1604,4.9643,2.1562,1.4882,2.6121,3.9763,0.878,1.8024,3.7848,0.3121,2.4309,1.9063,3.5522,1.3603,4.4971,1.24,3.2552,1.8737,5.2056,2.3596,2.6048,1.725,2.7672,2.575,0.1412,0.0603,2.8741,0.8852,0.2926,0.0453,2.8514,4.1299,2.6023,4.3681,3.3405,0.8817,6.1749,0.1431,2.9818,2.1333,1.4613,2.0719,2.6248,0.2253,1.6061,7.1436,1.1057,2.6856,2.0447,1.9003,5.8956,4.4406,5.5717,4.2379,1.4053,3.4325,2.5722,0.937,2.4103,2.8538,1.4085,0.0011,6.4701,1.4462,5.9046,3.0328,1.909,0.7701,5.1129,0.5061,1.7253,5.2901,0.9969,5.26,2.5023,3.7453,3.4341,5.211,3.3236,3.113,0.5588,2.3687,1.7766,5.0535,4.7438,0.6883,1.8381,0.5328,1.366,6.1802,4.2773,1.9757,0.2264,4.4499,3.0792,0.7057,1.8732,4.8644,1.8608,2.2356,1.0827,4.7799,1.2217,4.6288,2.4399,2.8205,2.9342,0.6316,0.6,3.649,3.2545,3.7497,0.9615,1.6255,4.3006,1.6099,2.991,6.7669,0.975,2.1377,0.269,0.8304,0.0002,0.9424,0.0028,3.6668,2.1451,3.8717,4.2403,4.4214,3.0097,2.6761,0.5481,0.8763,0.0001,2.9575,2.6469,0.1729,0.0182,3.1975,2.9459,1.8653,0.4338,1.9509,0.8251,1.5881,3.4523,0.0699,5.1716,3.2488,0.6042,7.2084,0.0032,1.7968,1.7306,5.5006,5.3691,2.2994,5.0626,1.9516,3.1491,2.7023,5.0437,0.3194,0.9781,0.0923,6.9823,2.4863,0.9441,2.2873,0.4213,3.9613,1.929,0.3403,6.6059,1.8722,5.2307,3.5827,3.4109,4.499,2.2757,3.6,2.4001,0.0621,0.0296,4.042,0.4202,1.6758,1.5988,1.0437,0.8595,2.2302,3.0828,0.9341,0.3899,0.5801,0.706,1.2704,2.2203,5.6933,2.683,0.0715,1.975,3.4957,0.2221,2.679,3.9692,1.0567,3.0236,1.3214,5.771,7.032,0.8178,1.7693,2.287,1.8028,3.0069,1.5337,0.0136,2.984,3.2482,3.3947,1.8338,3.2347,1.8385,3.4437,0.0244,4.5332,0.9569,2.9061,1.2334,3.0242,1.384,2.1054,0.0053,3.8797,3.6733,3.5285,1.3724,1.2813,0.9185,0.2548,1.5833,2.0571,1.384,0.0178,2.6588,2.6083,0.5258,2.1786,4.315,2.1082,3.4512,1.6672,2.4766,2.0438,0.3086,1.3621,0.1361,3.7073,6.2311,2.6588,6.8628,0.7591,3.3022,0.9618,4.9676,1.3688,1.082,0.2969,2.8172,5.9747,1.1349,1.3943,2.6809,1.7782,3.9427,0.2283,1.186,0.0772,2.5773,1.6691,0.83,3.2919,5.7994,2.6151,5.9009,0.617,5.0448,1.3622,4.4827,5.6092,0.4227,0.0846]}
{"id":485,"ended":true,"length":596,"text":"Our intelligent designers return to inform you that our purpose in life is to be livestock and our budding sentience is merely a result of how delicious they find our brains.\nEach year, our artists return to our location, our farms and our local farmers to continue educating and creating the community, while continuing a mission that was inspired by our ancestors, our forebearers and the livestock industry of Northern California. Their new series \u201cOur Intelligent Designer\u201d will be presented to viewers at a dinner party in October 2018, in St. Helena.\nThis will be a unique opportunity to engage, share and enjoy a variety of fascinating new concepts and themes as part of a comprehensive series of art and design events held from Nov. 27 to Nov. 28 and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day of the month at the St. Helena Art Gallery, the site of the Arts and Design Museum.\nThe first of our series is in the form of a special installation that is in preparation for our next series, which will feature all 13 paintings featured. The full series will be available to viewing at the Gallery on Saturdays through Oct. 28 and for viewing on Wednesdays and Thursdays through Nov. 28. All the work in the series will be exhibited on a special special tour throughout the month of October.\nEach painting will be part of our special series. Each painting is part of our series, although the artist will not necessarily bring each painting home and therefore do not want to bring home their paintings.\nThe Art Gallery also will be offering several different exhibition offerings that we plan to offer at the Gallery both on-site and in a limited number of locations throughout the month of October. These include our current exhibit of artwork and design materials by the Arts and Design Museum (AIM) \u2013 complete with exhibits and workshops from the show. We plan to post these materials throughout Oct. 28 and on Wednesdays through Nov. 28, but will be sending out weekly mailings through the months of October to facilitate the distribution of these materials.\nIn addition, the Art Gallery will be offering free parking for all residents on Saturdays through Oct. 28.\nAll art materials will be available to view at the Gallery. For more information, visit www.artsanddesignmuseum.org or call 512-867-7233 or 512-867-6328.\nAll of our original pieces are available online and are made from scratch and are shipped by a special courier or by mail. Our new series of paintings, titled \u201cThe Art of The Creative Life\u201d will celebrate the life of artist John McSweeney for 18 years and is part of our special series about the life and career of art director Mike Lutz, who will end his 20 years in 2019. The piece was created in 1995 by McSweeney, who worked in advertising, graphic design and media communications as well as the studio and graphic design for an ad agency during his 20s and 30s and had a career in film, commercials and communications.

{"id":4779,"ended":true,"length":605,"text":"Humans hibernate all winter, with the exception of `` necessary personnel '', that are on the move between summer months.\n\nThe species can be found in all the continental US, as far north as the Arctic (Cascadia), including up the Canadian border, through the North Atlantic Ocean (Pacific), along the west coast of the UK (England), and the Far North (Canada).\n\nHumans hibernate all winter, with the exception of `` necessary personnel '', that are on the move between summer months.\n\nIn order to survive for more than two years if they had human life jackets, that are often kept in a safe and secure environment, as well as being worn as long as possible, you must have a minimum of at least 10 layers of clothing, preferably a wool top jacket, that have a waterproof webbing that protects the animal from water, and that is in most areas below freezing.\n\nMost hibernators are in warm, dry environments that are very difficult to kill with long distance hunting techniques. However, wintering is difficult for most species and to survive in the warm and dry environment, particularly in areas without water.\n\nAnimals hibernate up to 24 hours a day as well as more than 28 days per year. In addition to this, hibernating is almost identical to other species in that they have a similar body shape and they are known to hibernate into the winter for many of the same reasons.\n\n\"It was important to make sure that we always provided warmth between hibernations,\" says Tim Karp, managing director of the Wildlife Conservation Society of Australia.\n\n\"The winter hibernating period is not only for warm and dry conditions, it is also when winter is the most active period.\"\n\nHibernating can be achieved either by means of different methods of fishing, or of hunting through various animal habitats (in this case, woodfishing).\n\nTo be more specific, Karp recommends that an adult female hibernating be fed in the same way one may be fed for the entire hibernating period.\n\nCaring for animals during hibernation can be a source of emotional stress and even depression.\n\nThere are several ways of doing this:\n\nAs with other types of hunting and fishing, Karp suggests that by keeping the animals protected during the winter or throughout their lives, they can remain safe, while being in a warm, cool environment, so that they are comfortable during the long months. With this in mind, he recommends hunting. In the latter, the animals hiberNose their food with the help of a waterproof webbing or a wool top jacket; it can be kept as long as possible. This prevents the animals from freezing at all times, but the animals die later.\n\nA separate type of hunting can also be used: The mating season, which lasts a few years, has been an essential part of hibernating.\n\nIf you are interested in having a baby hibernation you cannot go wrong with the Karp family's methods of Hibernation or simply using the two-day survival kit.

{"id":2402,"ended":false,"length":640,"text":"Diseases can be induced to separate from their host and take physical form. The host is cured if the disease is killed in its induced form. The graver the disease, the more monstrous the form it takes. A team of doctors decide to try and save a gravely ill child.\n\nThe doctor who is doing the experiments says, \u201cIn three months, we will discover a cure for the ailment. My colleague from London, Dr Ravi, has died from an acute gastroenteritis. The doctor was prescribed an antidote containing the antibodies so that the disease could be easily eliminated from the body.\u201d\n\nThe doctors are still searching for a cure for this disease, but because the body isn\u2019t ready to try any new therapies, they are now searching for ways to keep the disease alive.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for a cure for the ailment. Doctors are not only interested in making progress towards making people better but are also involved in solving the health problem by promoting the culture of the virus,\u201d said Professor Rajan Roy, the project manager and chief investigator of the Viracel drug candidate.\n\nWhat is Viracel?\n\nViral particles that can kill the microbes in the human body, or in some cases kill the diseased and give it life. Viracel is the second-in-command of the Viracel drug candidate. The drug is found in many medicines in which the viral particles have been destroyed.\n\nAt the moment, there is no cure for the disease. However, there have been promising outcomes in animal studies of the treatment of gut infection and related bacterial infections. Thus far, most experimental drugs have been found to have little to no effect on the bacteria in the gut. Many of the antibodies used in research to treat the disease are already in the gut. There have been promising results in human studies on the use of these antibodies.\n\nThe viral particles can be broken down into their target protein, which is what the microbiome is derived from. It\u2019s called the viral viral protein antibody\u20193 protein, and it contains a variety of enzymes that give rise to the viral proteins.\n\nThe viral virus is an RNA-like RNA that acts like a genetic code. In general, it can be broken down into the specific virus proteins to fight the virus. Thus, if any virus protein breaks down in an infected stomach, the virus can be killed. If it\u2019s not able to break down, the bacteria can\u2019t live because they lack a suitable host, which means that the infection can spread beyond the host. Thus, those infected in a stomach can survive further in the body where they can infect others in the body.\n\nThe researchers have taken part in six projects, which they plan to use to treat the chronic diseases that are being caused by bacteria. These projects aim to eradicate infectious microbes with one or more drugs that can help them live longer.\n\nThe scientists have developed a new therapeutic called Viracel, which uses bacterial infection as a primary target and then binds and binds the viral RNA protein, which has been produced by microorganisms in order to destroy the bacteria.

{"id":2771,"ended":true,"length":609,"text":"The Sentient Seaside Shack is one of my favorite places to eat. They have a selection of local and homemade meals, including a huge list of dishes that they made at their own table in-house, and they also offer a \"local\" menu (i.e. \"Cobras y Casta\u00f1a's\"). If you aren't too much into Mexican cuisine, though, you don't have to be into Mexican to enjoy their food and drink. They play host to one of my favorite bands, as well. Their music is always up-to-the-second, but there are also music and theater events where you can get to witness your favorite actors perform their favorite lines in front of others. There are plenty of places to get to while away from the world.\n\nCav\u00e9\n\nCav\u00e9 is the heart and soul of this family-owned and owned food place, and their food is delicious. I highly recommend visiting them if you have a family that loves Cuban food, or love having your own Cuban restaurant. I especially love the Cuban dish and the homemade barbecued pork and beef.\n\nTasting Island Coffee\n\nTasting island is your local coffee shop. They have a large selection of drinks and dishes that are popular with local coffee drinkers. Their food is always on the go and they do a lot of small stuffs. I highly recommend checking out their desserts.\n\nFairy Queen\n\nIt was recommended to me that both Fairy-Queen and F-Zero have the same themed food place. The food is fantastic, and the beer is always on the go. If you like this kind of food, head over to Fairy-Queen to have a look at their restaurant.\n\nTasting Island\n\nFairy-Queen is a great spot to learn the new tricks of the trade with the best places to eat in this small town. It is the only place in town that you can go to get free food once a month. This place is in the same as one of my favorite places to go to at the moment.\n\nCav\u00e9\n\nCav\u00e9 is the heart and soul of this family-owned and run-down food place. Their food is delicious.

{"id":3367,"ended":true,"length":695,"text":"An aging supervillian dons their gear for one last heist... [Katherine Sheff\/CBS via AP]\nIn a world where we sometimes forget what we're supposed to call \"what we should consider when we're out, if we're out and what we really have to do,\" old-fashioned morality can be lost in a way often misunderstood. And because we sometimes feel like we're wasting our time, this is a very important lesson.\nAs if to reinforce this point, one of the first actors who plays Voodoo in the blockbuster version of \"Game of Thrones,\" Bran Stark, famously portrayed by Benicio del Toro and his cast in the previous \"Frozen\" television show, plays Voodoo in his latest \"Sneakpeak.\"\n\"What I got away from the first \"Game of Thrones\" cast is that there were so many characters and that we can do so many things,\" Bran said in an interview with E! News. \"That there's so many different kinds of things that happened in the world or that we could do.\"\nBran, who has become one of the star power of this year's TV series and the first actor to play a role, went on: \"We really need more action. More action, more tension, more explosions.\"\nAdvertisement\n\"And there's not just one more thing being done, there's also one more thing being set on fire,\" he continued, \"So I think that's why it's so important to make sure that both Voodoo and Bran are a part of the next season.\"\nAt one point, Bran begins filming the action sequences with a pair of bare arms.\n\"I think you're also seeing it in this shot of the show when you're just walking down a hallway. If you're standing there, you're wearing like a jacket and you're holding a gun,\" Bran said. \"It's like it's a scene in a movie. It's a very, very, very difficult scene to do and even harder to do when you got to it.\"\nThe shot, which also showed an aging Voodoo soldier trying to catch a piece of ice from a nearby building, is one that's given a major focus in the last season. Although Bran isn't quite sure what to expect, we know that the Voodoo soldier will come back and try to rob a bank and the bank owner will get away with much more, especially since in a previous episode, he'll be getting some help from a dead corpse.\n\"I think he'll be here, there's an empty bank. I hope that's not the case,\" he continued, \"so if his body is real he'll look back with wonder and wonder and wonder and wonder and wonder and wonder, because there's nothing like seeing one of the most dramatic scenes of history.\"\nOne day after the flashback he's even more drawn than his real life, Bran has his own secret. And there are clues in the scenes. At the end of the episode, the man sitting there (played by the actor Robert Pattinson) is seen holding a knife to her head, which she later explains to Ned Stark.\nAdvertisement\n\"You would have

{"id":3111,"ended":true,"length":669,"text":"`` White Sea '' : Giant Fish Beached on Snowy Tundra as Men in Black Trench Coats Shake Hands' - WKOW 27: Madison, WI Breaking News, Weather and Sports\nThe world faces a huge problem as a massive snowfall of 6 inches of snowfall predicted tonight.\nThis week's \"glacial\" melting of the ice sheet of the Greenland ice sheet is expected to end on Friday.\nIn addition, one of the Arctic's most fragile and volatile regions will be covered by a 2 inch to 4.5 inch rainfall Friday. That means that the ice sheet will melt from about 0th of an inch to 5th of an inch each week.\n\"It's a huge ice sheet. There's not as much stuff as people make it seem,\" said Fred Firth, an environmental scientist with the Wisconsin National Laboratory.\nAccording to the latest projections from NOAA, there will be 2.2 billion tons of ice sheet melt in the spring of 2021, all of which will be concentrated below Greenland's ice sheet covering approximately three times the size of South America, or 8.3 billion cubic meters.\nThis means that the ice sheet is much weaker than its previous strength, which means that one month from now, the melting will be just below where it was more than a year ago\u20147.8 billion tons.\n\"We're almost there, you can't really anticipate being this tall,\" said Michael Spitzer, who led NOAA's Greenland Ice Sheet Management Team. \"The best thing you can do to prepare for this is to continue to prepare for this scenario and be prepared by being extra careful [about] how you're prepared.\"\nThe ice sheet is the world's most complex structure, comprised of multiple layers of ice. The ice sheet is so huge it has a huge thickness of almost 2.9 inches and a huge volume of water. When the glaciers melt, they melt less ice than when the ice sheet is strong enough to contain them.\nThe thickening of the ice sheet means that any melt is likely to be as strong as the glacier melt in the same amount of time as it actually melts.\nResearchers have estimated that melt levels in the ice sheet are almost twice the normal levels in the same time span, and that's why the Arctic is so sensitive to melt levels.\nAs with other types of melt-water, conditions are expected to vary widely throughout the year. Areas that melt during winter will likely experience a much warmer, drier climate while areas that melt during the spring and fall will experience a much cooler, drier climate for most areas of the year. In the Arctic, the temperatures will range from below average to below average depending on where melting occurs.\nThe ice sheet is projected to melt in more than one-third the area of Greenland during the 2021 summer heatwaves. The extreme cold that will hit Europe will be an increasing trend during the summer months and over the next five decades.\nIce sheet melt has been an essential part of humanity's climate response in the past. In the past, humans have found it difficult to control climate change, resulting in increased temperatures and less precipitation.\nBut the planet is now beginning to cool significantly as a result of the melting of the ice sheet and increased sea level.\n\"The bottom line is we're going to have to be very vigilant and stay ahead of this,\" said Spitzer. \"We don't know what our future prospects will be once it's done.\"\nCopyright 2021 WKOW.

She gets a ride home and tells her, \"A car has hit them on the side of the road... The car is in the middle of the road.\" A guy in the back of the car runs across the ditch and runs over the car. She says \"I'm sorry, dude, you are going to drive off.\" She and the guy are on and on. They are really worried about him because they said how they thought it was going to happen if they had to deal with the cops. The cops are very suspicious... She calls them to tell them he wasn't making progress. The cops think she is a bad person and ask her to let them know why she feels that way. The police come back and tell her the cops are going to come after them. The guy walks away. She realizes all of their actions. They find out that he was killed shortly before the accident and that he was a cop. A police report shows him killed and arrested for the crime... All the other cops have been there for hours.

{"id":1378,"ended":true,"length":663,"text":"A man who radiates bad luck meets a woman who radiates good luck, and she is the lucky one.\n\nIn a twist that's just kind of cute, a woman has an appointment to see a dentist that she may have gotten out of the world when she turned 21. But now, she needs her new dentist to find out if she can find a way to keep her tooth free.\n\n\"I said to the dentist I'd like to see if she can help because when I turned 21, I had one job and one job only,\" said Janae Stolte, the 25-year-old who had her heart set on the place where she'd work to save her tooth. \"Now I'm in need of a nice good old' bone.\"\n\nStolte and her fianc\u00e9 have a plan, but they're worried that the dentist is going to come in in a big hurry. So they're planning a trip to Cleveland. They also want to try to save Janae's tooth.\n\n\"I had some insurance that said, don't work for a week,\" said Stolte, her teeth were still not strong enough. \"But I'm very, very excited. I'm really happy to get out of this debt. I hate going home because I don't want to be a second-place payer on this date.\"\n\nThe dentist will help set up Janae's procedure and tell her what to do. Since the dental office has to make appointment at 2-3 p.m., they can only give her 1 or 2 hours to rest.\n\n\"Then we talk to her in a normal conversation, and she said, 'I wanna have this tooth extracted so that I can live the life I want to. If I ever had one of those bad-luck things, my teeth were going to be free of toothpaste for the rest of my life.' No, I won't,\" said Janae. \"She is free to live as she wants.\"\n\nAnd the next thing you know, they've decided to start saving it for her. No, she won't have to be a fifth-place payer. And, they believe she can find plenty of friends who will.\n\nThey got her an appointment to see a dentist in Cleveland, because she was a last-minute fit for an office appointment and since she had a lot of dental work to do before she turned 21, it's getting her ready for a busy day of appointments.\n\nShe'll have to find someone who can take care of her tooth that's better than her old one, plus some friends who will donate toothpaste instead of trying to find one more tooth by themselves. She's a lot like the other woman with a tooth problem.\n\n\"I mean, I get the whole idea of dental care and want to save it and pay it forward,\" said Janae. \"I really want to get the job. At the least, I like to save it and pay it forward. And I wanted to be able to have it,\" said Janae. \"So that's why I said I would want others to donate toothpastes.... I know people want to make a donation, but what are they going to do and how do they decide?\"\n\nAnd before they can make their choice, they gotta be sure to save it.\n\nCopyright 2017 Sunbeam Television Corp.

{"id":1643,"ended":true,"length":654,"text":"A deadly disease is ravaging the world above, as you and a team of scientists sealed in a lab underground are working tirelessly to find a cure, but then something goes horribly wrong...\n\nThe deadly virus, which is thought to infect nearly a million people around the world, has entered the world as a serious killer, according to a report in BBC News, with scientists baffled as it spreads.\n\nThe disease, dubbed Seizure, is said to be deadly to the brain, body and brain system, according to the BBC reports.\n\nBut despite the efforts by scientists, millions of people are not receiving treatment, and one in four people suffering from the disease are only allowed to travel if they had never got ill before.\n\nThe deadly virus, called Seizure, is believed to affect as many as a million people around the world and has left a devastating toll on health workers, a report in the Lancet medical journal has revealed.\n\nIt is believed the deadly disease is causing more than 1,000 deaths a month in the south coast of England, with further outbreaks elsewhere in the UK.\n\nDr Helen MacLean, the British Health and Welfare chief executive of the World Health Organisation, warned that \"this is a frightening development, as it is not just a deadly illness but certainly a major one.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a rare setback for the World Health Organisation, more than 100 people have died from the deadly disease, with more than 30 out of a possible 100 now infected.\n\nDr MacLean said this could be the only cure to combat the deadly virus - which can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and pneumonia- in countries such as the UK.\n\nThe World Health Organisation in March said it was now working on \"determined ways\" to end the situation, while France had also warned it was \"pending\".\n\nFrance is the most populous country in Europe.\n\nThe World Health Organisation said the disease was being blamed on an outbreak of Ebola in Kenya which forced millions to leave their homes.\n\n\"Covid-19 is likely to spread to other people in the world as it causes a range of health conditions, from death to serious complications, such as infection with Ebola, Cholera, SARS and the virus H5N9 in China,\" said the WHO.\n\nThe agency said it was \"aware\" it had been affected but said it was at \"no risk\" and that no plans had yet been made for an outbreak or any other pandemic crisis.\n\nIt issued a news release quoting an international report from the World Health Organisation.\n\n\"The risk of widespread transmission or even life-threatening complications which the deadly virus causes raises the necessity to treat the patient with appropriate medical protection,\" the release said.\n\n\"This is why we advise parents to take precautions and to stay at home if they have concerns.\"\n\nThe disease has already claimed some 30,000 lives in this world since it started in 2014.\n\nAccording to a tally of reports from around the world by the BBC, the killer virus was believed to bring the world's best-known vaccines to Europe (or Europe as it is now known in Britain) and the Asia Pacific countries (Singapore,

{"id":3380,"ended":true,"length":701,"text":"Magic requires calories. The world's most powerful wizards must eat constantly.' - P.C. Lewis\n\nTuesday, October 13, 2002 -- \"We all know what happens when we have good intentions\" -- W.R. Rumsfeld\n\nHow can you \"be good intentions\"? At the same time, every once in a while you might end up with a bad dream. It may seem that nothing good ever happens and you will get through it and live up to the bad dreams you have. And it is often said that we only achieve bad dreams only if we keep up with the dream. If the dream only had one important goal and was a good goal for you to achieve then he may be able to create bad dreams for others. That is why we can all be successful while being true to our intentions.\n\nBeing happy is not always an equalizer. Being unhappy is very often not always both. So there may be a problem. That problem may also include being an alcoholic that sometimes gets drunk and gets bad dreams. However, drinking and drinking may have different effects and may not result in any type of bad dream. It could also be that the bad dreams you are trying to accomplish may not be possible in real life.\n\nIt may also be that the bad dreams you are trying to accomplish may actually be a good thing in the long run and therefore you can achieve the dream. And it is almost true that when bad dreams turn to good dreams then maybe it may just be the right time to make your life a better life and get comfortable with the bad dreams you are having. If that is the case, you can try to take the bad dreams with you on a daily basis and find out how this affects your happiness and happiness to a degree. But if it is really what you are feeling then you would have no problem focusing on the important things and focusing on the positive things for the best ever.\n\nWhen a dream does turn into a good dream then it might be difficult for you to focus on something that really matters in the short term which may be bad for you in the long run. Not only can you not focus on the bad dreams you are having but it would actually affect your whole life as well. So if you do not think about it when you are focusing on the bad dreams then you can't see the benefits and the long term which will only be beneficial to you after you finish the dream. So it is a good idea to try to take good dreams with you on a daily basis. And if for any reason you have doubts or complaints about the feeling you may have that you should try to deal with that problem and try to be supportive in your life. This can be done by going on a walk, going to a concert, watching tv with your friends etc.\n\nBeing good-hearted and loving your life can make all of life's problems and problems seem like a good thing. So it is essential that you make sure that you take good dreams with you on a daily basis and make it happen every day, every time. It should be always possible for you to live up to the dreams you are trying to achieve as a result of all of your endeavours and successes.\n\nForgetting that you are a wizard, or a writer or a doctor, and that you don't deserve much more than good goals, make sure that you focus on the things which really matter. If you don't have anything to gain from the bad dreams, then don't waste your time on your dreams and let them grow ever larger and ever stronger.","token_len":725,"entropy":[9.5453,12.01,1.7777,3.1226,6.4415,1.2477,2.5631,3.2341,9.4935,4.365,4.1077,8.209,10.1048,4.0522,5.938,2.0681,3.8107,0.1457,5.4041,1.4446,0.0222,10.7524,0.6455,2.6684,3.4386,0.296,3.9235,5.9118,4.942,4.3725,3.6992,1.2733,2.6825,2.6594,0.3216,2.3519,3.8348,5.6229,3.9092,5.3991,1.1708,6.3108,0.2428,4.0638,0.0375,4.436,7.4769,0.0005,0.8909,0.0003,6.0147,3.8731,1.7472,5.665,4.0038,1.8819,6.8276,1.5209,5.8233,1.4146,2.9919,0.0125,0.5436,6.1327,5.7048,0.0337,0.2818,0.016,1.622,3.4613,4.8075,0.0103,2.9722,1.147,1.7574,4.9492,0.7237,3.202,3.0597,2.3942,2.8446,5.5225,3.6358,2.3599,1.1646,3.4488,1.8086,3.8929,3.648,3.9348,0.6868,3.7072,4.5795,3.932,0.0199,2.2572,5.4069,1.8161,1.3344,1.7131,1.3819,4.35,2.6697,1.5701,3.736,4.8226,0.1818,3.2507,4.6608,5.0104,3.3564,0.4524,6.4887,2.2105,0.1036,4.7479,4.832,1.376,0.9596,5.7094,1.1095,3.9691,3.5754,0.5453,6.065,5.3268,2.7877,5.1326,2.6956,2.6942,3.8447,3.395,2.6184,4.1252,2.811,1.5053,1.9634,1.2009,3.7698,7.4773,3.9323,2.0422,3.6904,0.0174,5.2357,4.3995,0.1639,1.922,5.9221,0.8259,4.2123,0.5636,1.7956,2.3,3.4057,4.3635,1.8356,3.9709,6.0393,3.4891,5.1145,0.2038,0.7293,3.7227,0.4436,1.3509,0.0002,6.2658,4.6472,1.4486,2.058,3.2815,3.9618,5.6442,2.5895,0.6557,3.5383,3.0088,0.7602,6.2336,3.7975,1.9812,4.7044,7.9475,0.9072,4.5816,4.5354,2.9697,0.1642,2.1745,4.9282,3.7093,5.1798,2.3359,1.6723,4.8085,3.1848,3.0678,5.379,4.2985,6.0917,5.678,2.8751,1.3854,1.0555,3.3147,5.4155,0.8962,0.6405,4.6144,0.2078,6.3454,2.103,3.6676,4.5015,3.7534,1.8372,0.8163,2.9589,2.3101,2.0263,5.1398,0.0101,2.9417,5.7199,0.0019,1.7923,0.9452,0.3684,3.12,4.0889,1.8235,0.7088,0.5757,2.2743,2.5753,0.5289,2.006,2.7128,3.261,0.015,3.928,2.3947,1.1783,1.0038,3.5719,3.2208,4.4615,0.0157,0.5851,1.3313,0.0001,3.4452,1.5989,1.1256,0.1655,0.1417,1.9196,0.8888,0.1057,0.1729,0.1775,0.0621,0.0048,0.6168,0.2284,4.495,0.6616,3.0145,2.0942,2.9976,3.2134,1.1306,0.6396,0.0815,3.0971,5.2335,1.6384,2.3653,2.2969,2.1937,2.571,1.191,3.8036,2.161,1.4155,5.4802,4.987,0.2911,3.8161,4.7025,0.0542,5.544,3.5825,0.4691,1.197,2.749,6.2703,2.8477,3.8539,3.3253,0.2497,1.9309,2.1455,1.0077,0.4003,3.5282,2.8638,2.634,1.742,1.6884,6.0817,2.6954,3.497,8.195,1.2604,1.4238,2.2943,0.1915,0.7048,0.6678,5.0963,0.2328,3.6758,2.7301,0.6522,0.3603,0.0282,2.4696,2.1825,1.724,3.8205,0.7464,4.6598,2.1266,1.0951,0.2285,4.908,0.1408,2.1071,1.256,2.1488,0.0318,1.1833,4.4238,1.9763,1.5511,5.9559,3.6851,0.7067,3.1647,1.4328,2.5499,5.2709,2.5213,2.8316,2.4595,4.151,1.9782,2.1932,1.3536,5.1532,5.2819,0.4236,1.5253,4.5983,2.0757,1.3262,4.7001,1.9166,3.0208,1.5201,7.0105,0.1462,1.2356,4.4975,1.0558,1.9012,4.6483,0.2401,0.9871,2.6628,0.5291,4.5765,0.9382,4.3468,6.2242,0.3485,0.4808,0.0001,3.9765,3.8848,2.222,3.4365,1.1467,1.9223,0.3352,1.4391,0.1152,1.1035,1.0853,4.151,0.9359,4.7603,1.6158,0.245,0.1012,3.7357,0.1659,5.2311,2.0455,3.5819,0.5396,3.1643,1.2181,2.7987,0.3721,6.1503,1.9804,1.7679,4.2663,1.9107,0.3442,2.2056,0.106,0.0365,0.5853,0.2315,5.909,0.8408,3.1449,0.8517,1.5736,1.8225,0.0832,1.2065,3.3114,0.4312,1.2764,0.3315,1.6309,1.3621,2.3409,3.5519,4.6826,4.7846,0.6065,4.2155,0.3579,2.6997,0.3167,0.235,2.6064,2.1296,0.4057,3.3473,1.3887,3.9771,0.9463,2.3572,4.6809,0.7596,1.5799,6.1094,0.0717,1.0235,1.2987,0.0664,1.1148,0.7633,3.0722,3.3696,4.0829,1.5018,4.7756,2.8223,2.5098,4.3655,0.3343,6.9566,2.5933,3.2553,2.0577,2.863,0.988,0.1853,5.6059,1.0583,4.479,1.2071,1.5178,0.2787,2.9894,2.6711,0.7816,3.3649,0.6614,0.2538,0.1124,2.0561,0.4605,3.2644,3.0372,0.6599,0.3944,0.0097,0.6291,0.1034,0.2996,0.0059,1.362,3.1593,1.5617,6.4548,2.3851,0.0586,0.5111,2.9237,4.503,2.1093,7.6618,0.7486,1.3347,7.8343,2.7165,4.4323,1.6685,3.4339,1.1483,2.1263,1.7074,0.4527,5.5613,0.0104,2.8083,1.6198,2.4094,2.3093,0.2774,3.8929,5.5699,3.4586,1.1822,3.3437,0.7505,4.3138,2.3336,0.8336,1.4581,0.9871,3.0568,3.0941,0.8114,4.786,2.9571,2.5516,0.3444,0.9665,3.693,0.68,4.5462,4.2517,4.7747,1.1617,0.6076,4.7719,0.3251,1.9547,0.0001,4.6459,2.997,5.5456,2.5492,1.6722,2.1874,4.9747,2.1239,2.4139,3.0845,3.969,1.5181,3.695,5.5646,0.4498,2.9439,1.2504,3.1506,3.371,1.9141,1.5121,0.4338,0.7081,2.8182,2.2819,0.3957,5.6441,0.8504,0.3012,3.6513,1.5267,0.6049,0.6209,3.51,0.8081,1.6027,0.2713,0.0091,0.4463,0.055,0.1935,0.0062,1.6443,3.4893,2.9598,4.2348,3.6848,0.4311,3.8974,1.5595,3.4209,0.7545,2.6182,4.7334,0.8792,5.8768,3.8341,1.7152,0.5459,0.0778,4.26,1.7381,0.0089,1.4348,1.5346,0.3186,2.0076,0.5738,0.0172,0.4474,4.4334,3.2359,1.8376,0.303,3.8732,0.8147,1.3728,5.469,0.0105,1.3255,4.2693,0.3411,0.8162,0.0002,4.4181,6.0978,3.3368,1.3419,1.1444,3.4814,7.2492,2.4353,2.3852,2.3989,5.225,1.3304,0.5996,3.9506,1.4775,4.3943,1.1601,0.4823,3.952,0.0013,5.4386,5.2269,3.2285,0.2541,4.0765,7.0395,1.6442,5.6248,0.5658,0.2939,0.204,4.3302,0.2218,0.9853,1.7794,3.2144,2.414,0.0867,2.3218,2.7492,0.44,2.6386,0.0012,1.9204,3.7987,1.1625,2.9632,0.8157,2.5071,3.3426,0.0971,2.91,1.0,3.3467,0.0007,3.8366,0.5918,0.2294,2.6512,4.4309,1.1192,1.9263,4.2673,1.3947,3.7561,5.7895,2.4778,1.1666,2.

{"id":1924,"ended":true,"length":701,"text":"Magic requires calories. The world's most powerful wizards must eat constantly.' - P.C. Lewis\n\nTuesday, October 13, 2002 -- \"We all know what happens when we have good intentions\" -- W.R. Rumsfeld\n\nHow can you \"be good intentions\"? At the same time, every once in a while you might end up with a bad dream. It may seem that nothing good ever happens and you will get through it and live up to the bad dreams you have. And it is often said that we only achieve bad dreams only if we keep up with the dream. If the dream only had one important goal and was a good goal for you to achieve then he may be able to create bad dreams for others. That is why we can all be successful while being true to our intentions.\n\nBeing happy is not always an equalizer. Being unhappy is very often not always both. So there may be a problem. That problem may also include being an alcoholic that sometimes gets drunk and gets bad dreams. However, drinking and drinking may have different effects and may not result in any type of bad dream. It could also be that the bad dreams you are trying to accomplish may not be possible in real life.\n\nIt may also be that the bad dreams you are trying to accomplish may actually be a good thing in the long run and therefore you can achieve the dream. And it is almost true that when bad dreams turn to good dreams then maybe it may just be the right time to make your life a better life and get comfortable with the bad dreams you are having. If that is the case, you can try to take the bad dreams with you on a daily basis and find out how this affects your happiness and happiness to a degree. But if it is really what you are feeling then you would have no problem focusing on the important things and focusing on the positive things for the best ever.\n\nWhen a dream does turn into a good dream then it might be difficult for you to focus on something that really matters in the short term which may be bad for you in the long run. Not only can you not focus on the bad dreams you are having but it would actually affect your whole life as well. So if you do not think about it when you are focusing on the bad dreams then you can't see the benefits and the long term which will only be beneficial to you after you finish the dream. So it is a good idea to try to take good dreams with you on a daily basis. And if for any reason you have doubts or complaints about the feeling you may have that you should try to deal with that problem and try to be supportive in your life. This can be done by going on a walk, going to a concert, watching tv with your friends etc.\n\nBeing good-hearted and loving your life can make all of life's problems and problems seem like a good thing. So it is essential that you make sure that you take good dreams with you on a daily basis and make it happen every day, every time. It should be always possible for you to live up to the dreams you are trying to achieve as a result of all of your endeavours and successes.\n\nForgetting that you are a wizard, or a writer or a doctor, and that you don't deserve much more than good goals, make sure that you focus on the things which really matter. If you don't have anything to gain from the bad dreams, then don't waste your time on your dreams and let them grow ever larger and ever stronger.","token_len":725,"entropy":[9.5453,12.01,1.7777,3.1226,6.4415,1.2477,2.5631,3.2341,9.4935,4.365,4.1077,8.209,10.1048,4.0522,5.938,2.0681,3.8107,0.1457,5.4041,1.4446,0.0222,10.7524,0.6455,2.6684,3.4386,0.296,3.9235,5.9118,4.942,4.3725,3.6992,1.2733,2.6825,2.6594,0.3216,2.3519,3.8348,5.6229,3.9092,5.3991,1.1708,6.3108,0.2428,4.0638,0.0375,4.436,7.4769,0.0005,0.8909,0.0003,6.0147,3.8731,1.7472,5.665,4.0038,1.8819,6.8276,1.5209,5.8233,1.4146,2.9919,0.0125,0.5436,6.1327,5.7048,0.0337,0.2818,0.016,1.622,3.4613,4.8075,0.0103,2.9722,1.147,1.7574,4.9492,0.7237,3.202,3.0597,2.3942,2.8446,5.5225,3.6358,2.3599,1.1646,3.4488,1.8086,3.8929,3.648,3.9348,0.6868,3.7072,4.5795,3.932,0.0199,2.2572,5.4069,1.8161,1.3344,1.7131,1.3819,4.35,2.6697,1.5701,3.736,4.8226,0.1818,3.2507,4.6608,5.0104,3.3564,0.4524,6.4887,2.2105,0.1036,4.7479,4.832,1.376,0.9596,5.7094,1.1095,3.9691,3.5754,0.5453,6.065,5.3268,2.7877,5.1326,2.6956,2.6942,3.8447,3.395,2.6184,4.1252,2.811,1.5053,1.9634,1.2009,3.7698,7.4773,3.9323,2.0422,3.6904,0.0174,5.2357,4.3995,0.1639,1.922,5.9221,0.8259,4.2123,0.5636,1.7956,2.3,3.4057,4.3635,1.8356,3.9709,6.0393,3.4891,5.1145,0.2038,0.7293,3.7227,0.4436,1.3509,0.0002,6.2658,4.6472,1.4486,2.058,3.2815,3.9618,5.6442,2.5895,0.6557,3.5383,3.0088,0.7602,6.2336,3.7975,1.9812,4.7044,7.9475,0.9072,4.5816,4.5354,2.9697,0.1642,2.1745,4.9282,3.7093,5.1798,2.3359,1.6723,4.8085,3.1848,3.0678,5.379,4.2985,6.0917,5.678,2.8751,1.3854,1.0555,3.3147,5.4155,0.8962,0.6405,4.6144,0.2078,6.3454,2.103,3.6676,4.5015,3.7534,1.8372,0.8163,2.9589,2.3101,2.0263,5.1398,0.0101,2.9417,5.7199,0.0019,1.7923,0.9452,0.3684,3.12,4.0889,1.8235,0.7088,0.5757,2.2743,2.5753,0.5289,2.006,2.7128,3.261,0.015,3.928,2.3947,1.1783,1.0038,3.5719,3.2208,4.4615,0.0157,0.5851,1.3313,0.0001,3.4452,1.5989,1.1256,0.1655,0.1417,1.9196,0.8888,0.1057,0.1729,0.1775,0.0621,0.0048,0.6168,0.2284,4.495,0.6616,3.0145,2.0942,2.9976,3.2134,1.1306,0.6396,0.0815,3.0971,5.2335,1.6384,2.3653,2.2969,2.1937,2.571,1.191,3.8036,2.161,1.4155,5.4802,4.987,0.2911,3.8161,4.7025,0.0542,5.544,3.5825,0.4691,1.197,2.749,6.2703,2.8477,3.8539,3.3253,0.2497,1.9309,2.1455,1.0077,0.4003,3.5282,2.8638,2.634,1.742,1.6884,6.0817,2.6954,3.497,8.195,1.2604,1.4238,2.2943,0.1915,0.7048,0.6678,5.0963,0.2328,3.6758,2.7301,0.6522,0.3603,0.0282,2.4696,2.1825,1.724,3.8205,0.7464,4.6598,2.1266,1.0951,0.2285,4.908,0.1408,2.1071,1.256,2.1488,0.0318,1.1833,4.4238,1.9763,1.5511,5.9559,3.6851,0.7067,3.1647,1.4328,2.5499,5.2709,2.5213,2.8316,2.4595,4.151,1.9782,2.1932,1.3536,5.1532,5.2819,0.4236,1.5253,4.5983,2.0757,1.3262,4.7001,1.9166,3.0208,1.5201,7.0105,0.1462,1.2356,4.4975,1.0558,1.9012,4.6483,0.2401,0.9871,2.6628,0.5291,4.5765,0.9382,4.3468,6.2242,0.3485,0.4808,0.0001,3.9765,3.8848,2.222,3.4365,1.1467,1.9223,0.3352,1.4391,0.1152,1.1035,1.0853,4.151,0.9359,4.7603,1.6158,0.245,0.1012,3.7357,0.1659,5.2311,2.0455,3.5819,0.5396,3.1643,1.2181,2.7987,0.3721,6.1503,1.9804,1.7679,4.2663,1.9107,0.3442,2.2056,0.106,0.0365,0.5853,0.2315,5.909,0.8408,3.1449,0.8517,1.5736,1.8225,0.0832,1.2065,3.3114,0.4312,1.2764,0.3315,1.6309,1.3621,2.3409,3.5519,4.6826,4.7846,0.6065,4.2155,0.3579,2.6997,0.3167,0.235,2.6064,2.1296,0.4057,3.3473,1.3887,3.9771,0.9463,2.3572,4.6809,0.7596,1.5799,6.1094,0.0717,1.0235,1.2987,0.0664,1.1148,0.7633,3.0722,3.3696,4.0829,1.5018,4.7756,2.8223,2.5098,4.3655,0.3343,6.9566,2.5933,3.2553,2.0577,2.863,0.988,0.1853,5.6059,1.0583,4.479,1.2071,1.5178,0.2787,2.9894,2.6711,0.7816,3.3649,0.6614,0.2538,0.1124,2.0561,0.4605,3.2644,3.0372,0.6599,0.3944,0.0097,0.6291,0.1034,0.2996,0.0059,1.362,3.1593,1.5617,6.4548,2.3851,0.0586,0.5111,2.9237,4.503,2.1093,7.6618,0.7486,1.3347,7.8343,2.7165,4.4323,1.6685,3.4339,1.1483,2.1263,1.7074,0.4527,5.5613,0.0104,2.8083,1.6198,2.4094,2.3093,0.2774,3.8929,5.5699,3.4586,1.1822,3.3437,0.7505,4.3138,2.3336,0.8336,1.4581,0.9871,3.0568,3.0941,0.8114,4.786,2.9571,2.5516,0.3444,0.9665,3.693,0.68,4.5462,4.2517,4.7747,1.1617,0.6076,4.7719,0.3251,1.9547,0.0001,4.6459,2.997,5.5456,2.5492,1.6722,2.1874,4.9747,2.1239,2.4139,3.0845,3.969,1.5181,3.695,5.5646,0.4498,2.9439,1.2504,3.1506,3.371,1.9141,1.5121,0.4338,0.7081,2.8182,2.2819,0.3957,5.6441,0.8504,0.3012,3.6513,1.5267,0.6049,0.6209,3.51,0.8081,1.6027,0.2713,0.0091,0.4463,0.055,0.1935,0.0062,1.6443,3.4893,2.9598,4.2348,3.6848,0.4311,3.8974,1.5595,3.4209,0.7545,2.6182,4.7334,0.8792,5.8768,3.8341,1.7152,0.5459,0.0778,4.26,1.7381,0.0089,1.4348,1.5346,0.3186,2.0076,0.5738,0.0172,0.4474,4.4334,3.2359,1.8376,0.303,3.8732,0.8147,1.3728,5.469,0.0105,1.3255,4.2693,0.3411,0.8162,0.0002,4.4181,6.0978,3.3368,1.3419,1.1444,3.4814,7.2492,2.4353,2.3852,2.3989,5.225,1.3304,0.5996,3.9506,1.4775,4.3943,1.1601,0.4823,3.952,0.0013,5.4386,5.2269,3.2285,0.2541,4.0765,7.0395,1.6442,5.6248,0.5658,0.2939,0.204,4.3302,0.2218,0.9853,1.7794,3.2144,2.414,0.0867,2.3218,2.7492,0.44,2.6386,0.0012,1.9204,3.7987,1.1625,2.9632,0.8157,2.5071,3.3426,0.0971,2.91,1.0,3.3467,0.0007,3.8366,0.5918,0.2294,2.6512,4.4309,1.1192,1.9263,4.2673,1.3947,3.7561,5.7895,2.4778,1.1666,2.

{"id":2288,"ended":true,"length":684,"text":"What You Think Is Happening Isn't Happening\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images\nThe first phase of our pandemic health crisis is being triggered by what we're saying, reading, watching or doing online. It's pretty easy to ignore what we've said. But now people are starting to notice it. We're seeing the number of deaths and illnesses rise; cases are jumping from one day to the next. We're hearing our children talk and talk, but nothing is happening. Some are afraid to go out because they think we won't be safe.\nOur fear is that our kids will continue to have problems, and it won't be safe to have them. If not, people will be afraid to be at home and stay at home. As we've seen with a lot of schools, teachers have to go off-line and do some self-isolation because we can't have our children alone.\nBut what if social distancing is all I need? It could be a really nice long walk out door for a few days and then I have to get to work. That sounds like a good idea, but being isolated without anybody to socialise with means that I'm not going anywhere.\nBut as long as we can socially distance and get out, we'll keep it at home, although this can slow things down a bit. We've discussed this before: \"There will be a lot of empty houses.\"\nWhat is the potential for this to become a crisis for children? According to the American School Improvement Association (ASIA), the average age of Americans aged 5 to 17 has quadrupled during the coronavirus pandemic:\n\"The school year has not only been a tremendous struggle for parents of children with Down syndrome, but for many families, as well as the families of students with autism. When the outbreak of the coronavirus hit China, the parents of children with Down syndrome were still dealing with how to keep their children and the school district to a minimum.\"\nWhile we're having a really hard time keeping families together, it looks like there are still options available. We've heard from parents who said they are unsure if they'll be able to get their kids to and from school, but they just can't decide on it. Many parents with Down syndrome were concerned about their children's health because they feel like they're left out of an ongoing pandemic pandemic crisis. They may not have the support they need for their children's wellbeing. So we need to get on the road to reopening schools. And here's what we can do about it:\nHere's How to Invest in Your Future\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock\nI understand how bad it can be for parents to have their kids shut down, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. I understand that this isn't a big deal. Our kids will be growing up to be smart and well-rounded, and all that, but not everything will be like it was during the pandemic.\nAs long as the schools are open (or if the schools stay open) families are going to be very, very busy, which may create a lot of emotional issues when their kids are in school. So I would recommend doing some research around family values, and the ways to make sure that parents and students are not leaving or turning to other ways to manage their kid's well-being.\nThis article appeared originally on LifeLine.\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

{"id":4343,"ended":true,"length":700,"text":"Batman snaps, kills the Joker and establishes a reign of terror over Gotham. It's up to Batman's next biggest villans to stop him.\n\nThe sequel to the blockbuster Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was released in 2014, and it won the Oscar, while the thirdBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (which was recently re-released) was released in 2019. Superman Returns did the same thing, earning a Golden Globe nomination. And after a year, it finally got its own movie title this year.\n\nIt's also up to the Batman franchise to decide how many movies it wants to make, how quickly it needs to adapt itself to the movie universe, and what the plot will be like in the new Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. And as for the future of Superman vs. Batman: The Animated Series' fourth movie, here's a brief look at the plot for that one, which is currently being touted as the 'fourth' of the big three movies.\n\nAs you can tell from the teaser trailer, it's an exciting time for us, with Bruce Wayne finally arriving for a visit. A series of mini-series and mini-plans are expected for the Justice League, as well as several animated series. But Batman is still the one that's most likely to release a full-length film this year.\n\nAt the moment, there's not much else to talk about in the latest Batman and Superman sequel, and after seeing how many movies it wants to make, it only makes sense that they would want to keep going for the fourth installment. Which could mean both Superman (who played the Joker in the first two movies) and Batman (who played the Joker in the first three movies).\n\nThe fifth animated project, titled 'The Last Knight', isn't so sure. We're left wondering what Batman is like in the fifth movie, so let's see what the current lead-up to the fourth movie looks like.\n\nIn the background of this post is a trailer for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which is an adaptation of the comic book series of the same name. In it, Superman (who played Jason Gordon in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice) battles Batman (who played the Joker in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice), who was just an extra. But it's also got a sequel, which has just been confirmed by a Twitter commenter.\n\nBatman's journey to the bottom of the tree after he is discovered and destroyed by the power of the Dark Knight will also continue in the new Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It's currently believed that both the fourth and fifth Joker films will be released after Batman v Superman (which is also the fourth Dark Knight film), and the sixth Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will also be released before the end of 2020.\n\nAnd finally, there's the fact that the last movie in this series was called 'The Last Knight', which is also a sequel to the original Batman v Superman. And there are a couple of other mini-series that have also been added to the Batman franchise (or Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is set to release later this year and The Last Knight may

{"id":1476,"ended":true,"length":700,"text":"Batman snaps, kills the Joker and establishes a reign of terror over Gotham. It's up to Batman's next biggest villans to stop him.\n\nThe sequel to the blockbuster Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was released in 2014, and it won the Oscar, while the thirdBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (which was recently re-released) was released in 2019. Superman Returns did the same thing, earning a Golden Globe nomination. And after a year, it finally got its own movie title this year.\n\nIt's also up to the Batman franchise to decide how many movies it wants to make, how quickly it needs to adapt itself to the movie universe, and what the plot will be like in the new Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. And as for the future of Superman vs. Batman: The Animated Series' fourth movie, here's a brief look at the plot for that one, which is currently being touted as the 'fourth' of the big three movies.\n\nAs you can tell from the teaser trailer, it's an exciting time for us, with Bruce Wayne finally arriving for a visit. A series of mini-series and mini-plans are expected for the Justice League, as well as several animated series. But Batman is still the one that's most likely to release a full-length film this year.\n\nAt the moment, there's not much else to talk about in the latest Batman and Superman sequel, and after seeing how many movies it wants to make, it only makes sense that they would want to keep going for the fourth installment. Which could mean both Superman (who played the Joker in the first two movies) and Batman (who played the Joker in the first three movies).\n\nThe fifth animated project, titled 'The Last Knight', isn't so sure. We're left wondering what Batman is like in the fifth movie, so let's see what the current lead-up to the fourth movie looks like.\n\nIn the background of this post is a trailer for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which is an adaptation of the comic book series of the same name. In it, Superman (who played Jason Gordon in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice) battles Batman (who played the Joker in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice), who was just an extra. But it's also got a sequel, which has just been confirmed by a Twitter commenter.\n\nBatman's journey to the bottom of the tree after he is discovered and destroyed by the power of the Dark Knight will also continue in the new Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It's currently believed that both the fourth and fifth Joker films will be released after Batman v Superman (which is also the fourth Dark Knight film), and the sixth Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will also be released before the end of 2020.\n\nAnd finally, there's the fact that the last movie in this series was called 'The Last Knight', which is also a sequel to the original Batman v Superman. And there are a couple of other mini-series that have also been added to the Batman franchise (or Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is set to release later this year and The Last Knight may

{"id":3900,"ended":true,"length":700,"text":"Batman snaps, kills the Joker and establishes a reign of terror over Gotham. It's up to Batman's next biggest villans to stop him.\n\nThe sequel to the blockbuster Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was released in 2014, and it won the Oscar, while the thirdBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (which was recently re-released) was released in 2019. Superman Returns did the same thing, earning a Golden Globe nomination. And after a year, it finally got its own movie title this year.\n\nIt's also up to the Batman franchise to decide how many movies it wants to make, how quickly it needs to adapt itself to the movie universe, and what the plot will be like in the new Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. And as for the future of Superman vs. Batman: The Animated Series' fourth movie, here's a brief look at the plot for that one, which is currently being touted as the 'fourth' of the big three movies.\n\nAs you can tell from the teaser trailer, it's an exciting time for us, with Bruce Wayne finally arriving for a visit. A series of mini-series and mini-plans are expected for the Justice League, as well as several animated series. But Batman is still the one that's most likely to release a full-length film this year.\n\nAt the moment, there's not much else to talk about in the latest Batman and Superman sequel, and after seeing how many movies it wants to make, it only makes sense that they would want to keep going for the fourth installment. Which could mean both Superman (who played the Joker in the first two movies) and Batman (who played the Joker in the first three movies).\n\nThe fifth animated project, titled 'The Last Knight', isn't so sure. We're left wondering what Batman is like in the fifth movie, so let's see what the current lead-up to the fourth movie looks like.\n\nIn the background of this post is a trailer for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which is an adaptation of the comic book series of the same name. In it, Superman (who played Jason Gordon in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice) battles Batman (who played the Joker in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice), who was just an extra. But it's also got a sequel, which has just been confirmed by a Twitter commenter.\n\nBatman's journey to the bottom of the tree after he is discovered and destroyed by the power of the Dark Knight will also continue in the new Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It's currently believed that both the fourth and fifth Joker films will be released after Batman v Superman (which is also the fourth Dark Knight film), and the sixth Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will also be released before the end of 2020.\n\nAnd finally, there's the fact that the last movie in this series was called 'The Last Knight', which is also a sequel to the original Batman v Superman. And there are a couple of other mini-series that have also been added to the Batman franchise (or Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is set to release later this year and The Last Knight may eventually be called \"The Last Knight\").\n\nThe latest iteration of Batman is currently on its way to release on January 1st, and it will undoubtedly be a fun little story arc that you can't help but enjoy once you've seen it.\n\nThe last Knight is currently the main sequel to the fourth Dark Knight film, and it's almost certain that it will be added

{"id":10,"ended":true,"length":696,"text":"Season 30 of Game of Thrones' 'The Night King': When Did it Happen?\nIn Season 30 of Game of Thrones, we're talking about Jaime Lannister. Jamie was probably in charge of the Winterfell kingdom as well. It's now confirmed that he had an iron hand over the White Walkers. So, the question is: will Game of Thrones return to the Iron Dome this season?\nThis is one of the most anticipated and emotional scenes in the series. That means that Jaime and his two daughters were only allowed to stay if they had to deal with the Iron Dome threat from the Night King. However, they're on their own to fight it out for the Iron Dome.\nMeanwhile, at a House of House of Dragons event a few years ago, Game of Thrones revealed that the Stark people were ready to leave the Iron Dome if it was attacked by the Night King. The reason? They wanted to win the battle against the Night King that day.\nSo, fans can guess what happened. A series of events, some personal, some major, got in the way, took place in Game of Thrones Season 30. But what happened in the Season 30 episode \"House of Kings\" is what we still see in the footage we've seen before.\nFans Are Hopeful to See More of the Stark People In Game of Thrones Season 30\nThe season got a bit messy, but for many of the other fans who watched it, Game of Thrones Season 30 wasn't messy. Some fans had a very difficult time getting into the episode as Jaime and his girls were already in the Iron Dome and the Stark people were too much of a threat to avoid it.\nIt also made many fans nervous when Jaime was left out of episode 2. If the season had ended in a similar fashion like season 2 did, maybe fans would have been able to understand his status in scenes like this:\n\"I'm just glad they're in there. He needs us.\" \u2014 Game of Thrones Fan On \"The Storm\" \"I don't want to go through with it.\" pic.twitter.com\/7W9kZv6FXp \u2014 Game of Thrones Fan (@GameGameTributes) February 19, 2021\nAt least one of the other fans were concerned about the appearance of a Stark in the show. Others thought that the game was made up since they had a much bigger part involved. For a more detailed look at Game of Thrones Season 30, check out The Newsroom's \"Game of Thrones\" review.\nFans Are Hopeful to See More of the Stark People In Season 30\nBut let's get back to our point about the scenes showing how the Stark people were able to defend themselves from the Stark people.\nGame of Thrones Season 30 Part 1\nThe first episode of Game Of Thrones Season 30 will be shown over the next few days. This means that we can go back and watch the entire episode. This means that we'll see Jaime and his girls in the hospital and there will be a fight before they get much more information about the whole situation. If the two-day battle wasn't as tense as the season 2 finale, we know why.\nSo, let's hope things get better, because what happened didn't help things and ended with a bad ending. If fans decide that it would make any sense to end the season instead of heading back to the Iron Dome, it will be one of the greatest moments in Game of Thrones History\nWe can't wait to see what's in store for Game of Thrones season 30 and the fans who did decide to go back to the Iron Dome.","token_len":734,"entropy":[7.6302,2.3977,6.6461,3.7901,0.754,5.1809,4.9443,1.1477,3.8423,2.5572,4.5468,6.4156,6.2285,3.8794,2.1993,0.0007,0.2936,1.0247,11.1363,2.8377,1.086,0.3579,0.0857,0.0049,0.0003,2.693,3.4516,2.6163,3.3806,0.3534,4.6647,0.3471,0.001,2.5724,7.9532,5.4878,5.474,3.2746,4.4079,0.2846,1.4378,4.6241,0.058,6.3786,4.3161,1.1815,1.1936,3.2759,1.1167,5.3233,5.2349,0.2899,1.335,4.3296,2.5755,7.6779,1.2826,5.1443,1.4563,4.2749,0.0644,0.0006,1.1362,3.7521,2.0116,3.6144,2.7837,1.0029,2.2703,4.5667,5.5023,0.015,0.0026,4.1773,0.5035,1.5086,4.2349,10.9011,2.7483,0.5167,0.4946,1.1166,3.8794,1.3016,3.3876,0.2404,0.7092,1.5671,2.7532,3.4415,6.2219,3.4707,0.8619,0.859,1.2825,1.0488,5.2985,4.1853,1.4656,4.0643,2.0248,1.4985,5.0203,3.2169,3.9219,5.5611,3.401,0.2332,2.7261,5.4925,0.4547,3.0007,1.8609,6.2001,0.0082,1.283,3.2017,1.5834,5.1878,3.1185,1.2543,2.7823,0.5598,0.5263,4.269,0.0498,3.5995,3.1012,5.1879,1.754,0.8132,3.7581,3.5542,2.1909,0.4408,3.395,1.4251,1.5973,2.5625,0.6835,1.3822,6.0953,0.1227,4.7779,4.4645,5.0491,1.9243,4.3463,3.5491,7.3076,2.0475,5.8125,1.4238,3.1359,1.1593,0.236,4.8421,0.0204,0.009,5.8204,0.4975,1.8999,5.0374,5.6887,1.5966,5.6289,0.3225,3.8088,1.3027,1.339,0.0978,2.9351,2.8875,1.4566,3.0197,1.2041,0.7551,1.0379,0.0468,0.2524,2.3904,4.3785,3.0995,1.8493,2.2479,0.3235,5.7501,1.1682,3.0777,2.8353,0.2824,0.9514,0.0124,5.4652,3.8642,0.3313,1.1713,3.0723,0.5717,7.8828,2.9942,5.2708,1.5513,2.1271,1.8017,4.4862,5.3853,0.4053,1.3599,3.4468,3.6042,7.3148,1.445,1.1741,4.4637,1.1675,6.0154,3.3439,0.0634,0.0047,4.2639,6.9189,0.8969,2.2053,3.5618,0.012,0.0032,3.3759,0.6366,0.7167,4.003,3.1065,2.9012,2.6133,2.0561,3.9957,0.4303,2.7707,0.7674,4.9937,0.304,4.3071,0.9211,1.4879,2.9902,2.273,5.5521,4.3651,0.9481,1.287,7.5506,3.7821,2.0535,0.3117,4.0173,0.4495,0.7308,5.9767,7.4181,5.7044,3.8517,3.0537,0.8025,3.9425,1.1028,1.8039,3.8243,2.0547,2.8949,0.7998,0.0553,0.0026,0.7139,0.1226,0.6362,2.6001,4.5245,9.1657,2.5458,2.0701,5.5701,2.4835,1.2982,4.7502,4.1913,2.2339,1.8727,5.3336,3.4822,1.5695,2.4199,2.1525,0.3973,2.856,0.0027,0.0022,0.6352,0.0387,4.9307,0.0005,9.464,1.6567,3.8688,1.6162,3.5983,2.2979,3.3475,3.8403,0.0699,2.312,2.7396,0.5237,3.5365,3.3796,4.5553,1.6749,1.3847,4.0343,1.3491,5.1098,2.0768,0.5821,1.1612,0.0237,3.1213,2.5838,3.7919,0.8099,0.6246,5.675,4.5741,1.2876,0.0884,1.0825,0.8022,7.1652,4.0925,0.1841,1.0481,3.6485,2.9686,3.1519,5.0334,0.8685,3.3334,3.6933,3.2713,2.3939,4.6929,2.2387,0.428,7.2853,3.8667,1.1539,4.8678,2.3071,3.3268,2.8757,1.9368,2.1933,1.1048,3.3489,0.6999,6.1881,3.2909,2.252,1.2943,0.1934,4.6967,3.5474,0.3672,0.2284,1.754,1.6517,0.005,4.6489,4.9746,4.8668,1.7676,9.0753,1.8596,1.3339,4.2391,0.1388,2.561,2.3505,1.8207,3.8299,2.3076,3.0453,2.1315,3.1042,1.9983,1.438,4.0878,5.2019,4.5752,2.3605,4.3353,5.2493,0.0513,0.0089,5.7372,5.344,4.9332,1.5171,5.4083,2.1615,6.0996,1.7408,2.7915,0.0011,2.1451,0.4622,2.8351,3.3,3.0727,1.4068,2.7487,7.1301,0.0008,0.0,0.0006,0.0003,0.0008,4.4142,4.1935,3.7191,4.2893,3.7531,4.3496,3.9881,7.9624,4.5218,0.6884,2.9327,0.1057,0.0016,0.3852,4.7437,1.1919,9.3307,6.1631,9.1404,0.0252,2.6702,3.5452,0.0002,13.8165,0.245,5.282,2.4904,1.7756,1.9903,0.4648,3.3675,2.0415,5.3444,4.3015,1.1926,1.3076,5.7142,0.0472,2.9615,1.9418,3.3451,0.7972,3.1352,0.5705,6.2674,3.4615,1.0968,1.6395,5.4837,1.3607,6.761,2.0268,7.5098,3.1517,2.7509,3.6308,4.8158,2.1068,5.3039,5.7928,2.3741,4.7897,3.7995,4.8345,1.888,0.8283,0.3406,3.0631,0.0039,0.0039,0.5062,0.0167,0.5421,0.8733,0.0235,4.2723,6.7961,1.8267,1.1692,3.8256,1.8117,0.0533,0.0085,2.3796,3.7322,0.5597,0.4393,3.9457,1.0088,1.5922,0.2405,0.2406,0.133,0.2378,0.1181,0.1017,0.3292,0.0112,0.3777,3.1898,0.0034,0.2662,4.8453,5.2916,0.0283,3.1435,0.8879,0.0374,3.5884,5.363,1.9311,1.0882,5.8565,5.8893,3.5,1.399,2.3517,0.5014,1.5708,3.9224,0.0027,5.0681,1.0789,1.9778,0.2229,3.68,2.0452,0.4376,1.6103,2.8646,0.0325,0.0081,0.354,0.0377,5.7025,0.9061,2.1675,1.9112,1.9092,2.5452,0.4468,1.1285,5.9458,0.0012,0.8557,0.0177,4.68,1.1921,3.5662,5.3947,0.608,1.094,0.9266,0.8234,0.6731,3.5108,3.1596,0.2399,2.0803,2.7205,4.8863,1.1233,1.0334,0.6191,1.1046,2.1517,1.2521,2.1632,3.3437,2.1591,0.2893,1.1972,1.8186,1.3436,3.5365,1.2062,0.7083,1.922,1.7528,0.6095,9.2921,2.2917,5.3002,0.9331,0.2311,1.369,5.2872,5.3282,1.584,1.7525,8.7972,2.6314,3.281,1.0541,0.8784,5.4804,1.554,0.1337,4.9361,2.8908,4.7135,5.8895,3.417,1.9463,4.5419,0.0003,4.5883,3.0757,0.3882,1.993,3.8632,2.5946,2.7121,0.351,2.0553,5.0171,3.8042,0.7896,0.4995,3.8115,0.438,2.7546,0.0171,3.9894,6.2016,1.7723,1.4564,4.0799,2.0096,4.3739,4.1011,5.9146,0.0003,3.3379,3.4794,6.4292,4.9768,3.6356,1.5961,5.2363,1.5761,0.3899,3.7923,5.1127,5.7123,1.3817,2.8358,3.9407,3.0608,4.939,1.2099,0.7807,5.5118,0.7656,0.9134,7.5272,0.1434,5.3248,0.7544,0.2448,0.6048,0.7773,0.0131,0.4221,2.6216,2.4488,1.3842,4.0333,0.5535,0.1551,3.3871,2.0049,0.9039,1.8135,0.4848,0.0014,5.4179,8.5304,3.6529,2.8316,1.2259,0.459,0.3329,0.1436,0.9078,2.9546,2.2839,0.039,0.2465,1.6654,0.3446,0.0018,2.9529,0.0431

{"id":4353,"ended":false,"length":654,"text":"A secretly immortal man is given a life sentence for a crime he didn't commit and now fears the discovery of his true nature is only a matter of time.\n\nThe book The Secret Life of Pets: The Secret Life of Pets by Ian Firth, written by Simon Sinek, is published by Viggo Mortensen, the world famous author of \"A New Hope.\"\n\nBucklin said the book was told through the lips of the American author for \"only one day\" and she said he would make \"a speech of condemnation to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\"\n\nBucklin said the book also told about the life and death of Charles Dickens himself.\n\nThe book won the 2008 edition of the Christian Science Monitor's 2011 Choice Award for its depiction of the life of a prophet named \"Jesus Christ.\"\n\nBucklin said she watched \"The Secret Life of Pets\" in order for the book to become \"an actual book.\"\n\n\"But there were some things that stood out. The book was so very very different from books with a lot of other things, or even movies that I have, that I had to stop reading,\" she said. \"I'm quite certain God created it exactly so that this book could become a book for people who are really hard to get excited about. That's why we tried to make it as realistic as possible.\"\n\nFirth said she wanted readers to think of him as a prophet who was able to use his power for good.\n\nFirth said it felt like God had him \"as a prophet\" and she had a special need for her to \"get into these conversations about the world and the way God has been affecting our lives.\n\nBucklin said she also noticed a scene in the book in which \"her angel's body becomes a mirror. If I think about what I have said before, I can't say anything. I can\u2019t even see the mirror.\"\n\nFirth explained that the angel that she wants to use in his book is a dead angel and she hoped people will use their consciousness \"to connect to this angel\" who may have some other ideas.\n\nShe said while her story wasn't about the angel in the book, it would be nice if people came up with an idea of what it would look like with their own consciousness at this level.\n\n\"I suppose a picture of it doesn\u2019t matter and it should look like it\u2019s just in a mirror,\" Firth said. \"People are always excited about that book. But I think God created this thing, there\u2019s no reason to believe that this is something that the angel is talking about. What God said in the book is, He created you as a prophet and you couldn\u2019t hurt the angels as long as they are alive.\"\n\nBucklin said she wasn't sure how realistic a prophecy such as \"The

{"id":449,"ended":true,"length":613,"text":"A catastrophe has destroyed humanity, but everyone's still alive.' - Pashtuns\n\nShare via e-mail\n\nPrint\n\nRelated Topics\n\n(NAN) \u2013 Many of the villagers of Sohrab, the largest village in the Himalayas, did not see any new crops crop till the late 1990s. By the time the cyclone hit, many of the residents had migrated to neighbouring regions.\n\nAt one point, villagers complained and called authorities and feared for their survival due to the high risk of flooding.\n\nBut the authorities and the locals got everything right.\n\nResidents in Sohrab have been celebrating as though they never woke up.\n\nSince then, people on both sides of the river have turned to their neighbour Pashtuns for help.\n\n\u201cWe don't know the cause (of the cyclone) or our chances of survival, but we all know about the dangers of farming and how dangerous farming can be,\u201d said Pashtuns, who own only their village, Sohrab, in the western province of Himachal Pradesh.\n\n\u201cBut we got everything right. Nobody dared to do harm to our people. We can always blame the people. But we tried to do our best,\u201d said Pashtuns.\n\nMany of the village residents claim they still lost their homes last year, but for many of the villagers, the destruction brought them to their knees.\n\nThey started packing their belongings into a suitcase and the next day were rescued from the river.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping to have our homes. But the situation was dire,\u201d said Jhargwal of Sohrab.\n\n\u201cI have heard people in the river calling us \u2018terrorists\u2019 but we were not prepared to die from the storm,\u201d said Dinesh of Pashtuns.\n\n\u201cWe were very worried. I was not even sure about survival. But the relief mission was so good. The village became a little less crowded. Now we're back to normal life,\u201d said Jhargwal.\n\nBut the government has not promised to return the residents.\n\nThey have decided to stay in the village.\n\n\u201cWe got a call on Tuesday which said that the flood water had entered our village. That's when it happened. But we couldn't save the family or our village. We're living below the water for now,\u201d said Dinesh, about the flooding.\n\n\u201cThe villagers have worked so hard to return us. We've even given away three mobile phones to families in the river. We hope they get the chance to send us back soon.\u201d\n\nIn the last year, floodwater in the river has caused more than 700 deaths and a further 50,000 were displaced.\n\n\u201cWe're still trying to live here,\u201d said Dinesh of Pashtuns.\n\nResidents in the village are desperate to return to their houses after the cyclone hit.\n\n\u201cWe've got three days left today. But I know that, as long as we live, nobody will come to us, and we'll die. But we're all in this together,\u201d said Dinesh.\n\n\u201cWe need the government to come to the river to help us, but we should also stay here. We can start a movement to save the people here.

{"id":2493,"ended":false,"length":690,"text":"You crash on as island. The locals, impressed with your technology, start showing you their magic. You have a scientific explanation for everything, but one thing still puzzles you. You have not seen the new computer, it doesn\u2019t work properly. You can\u2019t use the power, its useless. Is that an explanation? You have to do something!\n\nIt\u2019s a bit tricky for those of us who are new to running games but we got to it. If you want to see how the computer works don\u2019t forget to check out my video on the computer. In terms of applications it can be run on any computer. I only use it for multiplayer (i.e. the PC only).\n\nSo if you want to try this on the PC just turn it on for some extra excitement!\n\nLet\u2019s go!\n\n1. Go to the menu.\n\n2. Click Start -> Open Control Panel -> Go and control desktop. It takes you to a menu which you can choose from. That\u2019s all you need to do :)\n\n3. Go to System, or Advanced -> Open Control Panel, then select System, or Advanced -> Open Control Panel, then enable Command Prompt -> Enable Command Prompt. That\u2019s the one that you\u2019ll need :)\n\n4. Go to your home screen. If it\u2019s not there there\u2019s nothing more you can do. If it is there your computer will automatically launch from this site when you log on to use the computer.\n\nIt\u2019s not really that difficult if you get into a game. Just get into it man :)\n\nSo that\u2019s it, you\u2019ve made it!\n\nHappy gaming,\n\nEric\n\n(thanks for the review! My advice to those who are new to running games is to learn how to run. When you start up the game, it\u2019s like waking up to a different world. But you\u2019ll just have to be more specific in my review.)\n\n[\u2026] I hope you enjoyed my review. So please consider reading this review for myself! It helps me understand how things work and what works and what doesn\u2019t work so it\u2019s definitely worth keeping an eye out for [\u2026]\n\nSo I\u2019m going with an opinion that has just been shared by a lot of people and I got it for free from the GamesRadar store. Since I\u2019ve just purchased a game from them, I\u2019ve been playing it since it came out.\n\nSo today I decided to give it the go-ahead to run in my house. I didn\u2019t mind at all! I bought it from the store back in February and I ran it for the first time in 6 years today! Today I finished the first mission in the mission-free mode. Of course I had a couple more things to work on and I wanted to show off how well it worked. So there are a couple of [\u2026]\n\nSo I\u2019m starting the review of my current RPG. Here\u2019s what I think: 1. I play games and I want people to know about how things work. If people are excited to know about how things work, then that is a strong indicator that the game is fun \u2013 if you aren\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t recommend it at all. 2.

{"id":4956,"ended":false,"length":694,"text":"A person with retrograde amnesia attempts to jump-start their memory by searching through their own social media profiles.\n\nThe result is a new experience of thinking, dreaming, and remembering things.\n\nIn a new study, researchers found that a person with dementia may have a lifetime of social media users who used \"fancy\" photos of themselves for identification of the next day.\n\nIn a study, researchers from the University of St. Paul and the University of California at San Diego compared the ages of participants who had and use of virtual memory chips. That means they were all aged 46 years old.\n\n\"We found that even though individuals seem to have had the capability of visualizing a lot of things on virtual memory chip, people with dementia may still be at risk of forgetting a daily dose of something important,\" said co-author Adam Schaeffer of Latham House and University of California, San Diego.\n\nAlthough most memory chips have a function of recognizing all social media users, the researchers say there is no proof that they give a person a mental picture, or recognize their name on the chip themselves and give it to the person.\n\n\"This is quite a big step in the right direction,\" Schaeffer, a neurologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANG), told LiveScience.\n\nSchaeffer and his colleagues discovered that those who had the virtual memory chips had a lifetime of users who had a tendency to use those images for visual memory rather than identifying themselves as \"real people.\"\n\nThey also found that the \"real people\" in the group didn't display their identities correctly in social media, and were actually trying to use the images in order to identify themselves on their face. While that was a positive, many users with dementia had a tendency to use a photo as a visual identifier for others, and were often afraid to use it themselves.\n\n\"This is another sign that the brain is working at a higher level than it has before,\" Schaeffer said.\n\nThe researchers argue that even if people do forget their name, it is unlikely that they actually identify themselves because they're afraid.\n\n\"The real people are really likely to be looking for something in their photo, and not as a visual identifier, so it's rather interesting that people with dementia don't always find their identification in their photo,\" Schaeffer said.\n\nThe new study is not the first study to show that people with dementia in a person's social media profiles experience difficulty recognizing their identities. In another study, researchers found that people who have dementia in someone's friends and relatives had trouble recognizing their names when referring to their own families, making their identities very awkward.\n\nThis is unusual for one reason: The findings also show that a lot of the memories in people's online accounts have a lot of difficulty recognizing the names of family members, and many people in such memories also see their names as well.\n\nIn addition, social media photos are often not able to identify the person's true identity, meaning the social media posts seem fake. In recent years, many people think they are real people, and the people who say they are are usually \"real people.\"\n\nThe researchers believe this may pose a problem facing people who struggle with the mental status of people with dementia.\n\n\"It's not surprising that people with dementia have very limited social connections and sometimes feel the need to avoid social interaction altogether,\" Schaeffer said. \"We may be finding that people who have dementia don't really have people they can interact with any more because our brain may be going through a new phase of learning.\"","token_len":743,"entropy":[7.6763,3.2063,10.5928,1.1459,4.3256,0.0565,10.2071,0.1314,8.0814,4.8618,0.1552,2.5957,1.725,1.5059,6.0664,2.0736,2.0416,4.6246,6.2977,1.4268,2.266,1.1701,1.924,0.0004,2.3363,5.3237,0.3191,1.3397,5.3043,6.4778,2.6458,5.5639,2.2451,6.3116,0.6027,0.99,3.0453,2.4344,1.4661,1.1597,0.0002,3.5006,1.9717,2.4128,0.427,0.8502,0.8469,2.7356,0.1813,3.5432,0.5093,0.7595,4.9397,3.3537,1.7932,1.9098,6.0465,0.2942,4.4671,2.1393,5.5592,1.057,5.0084,4.9189,5.036,4.8576,0.8543,3.4304,0.9767,0.6151,4.9989,8.3323,6.1604,3.3103,4.4704,1.6156,1.7255,0.4901,0.0002,3.344,1.8927,1.5037,2.6394,0.6624,3.0308,0.7327,0.7504,0.0073,4.9947,0.9885,5.1001,1.6716,0.87,0.4573,0.007,2.6625,1.9505,0.9127,0.5723,3.9759,1.5858,4.9269,0.1157,3.7948,0.7135,1.6681,4.9366,6.3183,2.2461,7.3328,4.5604,7.1935,1.7695,6.5441,3.0116,1.5581,1.6584,4.1153,4.6642,5.3884,2.6681,2.492,1.7679,0.3076,0.0002,2.4084,1.9911,1.5469,0.2334,5.3285,1.6235,4.3608,7.3606,0.2448,0.9031,4.5491,3.2151,4.9212,1.9628,5.0312,0.1742,3.2921,3.509,0.2087,1.3955,3.5571,6.2129,1.8175,3.8604,0.6629,3.9627,1.1862,1.0287,2.8142,2.127,1.5671,4.1495,2.168,0.945,2.2738,3.3267,9.0395,5.2655,0.1177,3.0359,3.2108,0.8894,0.6839,3.2153,0.0716,0.1433,6.2909,4.9994,5.038,0.0719,2.5882,7.5104,7.4664,5.5765,3.6161,3.3732,0.7566,2.2155,0.6692,0.2375,0.2971,0.3072,0.225,0.0002,5.3752,4.0863,5.2519,1.2159,2.3413,1.7236,6.633,1.7492,4.7997,6.0071,5.3375,1.3638,1.803,0.4877,1.6469,1.112,2.9528,3.2845,1.0178,1.9384,4.9045,0.3491,2.5054,6.5979,2.4509,1.0159,2.3416,5.6948,2.5566,5.0826,2.0435,6.7171,2.6328,4.364,3.8689,1.9598,3.1976,5.9335,6.4593,5.4474,2.1973,0.5577,3.0331,0.7573,1.6885,0.2767,0.0002,1.3473,2.765,1.3179,4.8448,1.4279,3.1813,2.9425,2.1859,1.1123,0.3139,0.0011,0.8546,1.0743,0.0019,0.0004,5.3078,1.412,5.4934,0.0275,0.6376,6.2645,0.7463,0.0018,0.04,0.0162,5.3631,0.5008,12.7613,1.2738,1.4087,0.7389,1.0383,0.1872,0.6176,0.0002,3.3716,0.0042,0.0003,1.0968,0.4602,0.5012,4.9833,0.4369,3.5891,0.8267,1.4608,2.7472,5.9553,0.2102,0.4997,2.0452,1.1285,2.2782,0.0938,2.4649,0.339,2.3988,2.9412,4.6208,0.1239,2.7757,3.6758,2.1705,1.9351,4.3553,4.3031,4.3842,0.0035,5.3025,3.2781,2.0478,3.277,2.7516,1.3927,0.3523,0.378,0.0001,2.7043,1.8551,0.2148,0.1569,2.0568,3.6117,2.1119,1.3718,0.0286,2.483,0.838,2.5163,4.3403,0.0005,4.2462,3.2068,4.526,5.6062,2.8715,3.7079,0.3076,1.9847,2.1073,3.2695,4.352,5.1633,0.0268,3.9642,1.6007,1.6112,2.6914,3.2274,0.0162,3.5851,0.6284,4.322,3.0251,6.1608,0.511,6.7149,3.1561,2.8989,2.2407,4.3452,4.1639,5.7214,2.7941,3.5307,1.0169,2.6739,1.7899,1.0655,0.064,1.6973,3.8059,3.2557,3.6459,0.717,4.0323,4.2028,2.7423,4.8521,1.3146,2.0874,2.5029,3.7638,6.2896,0.5631,1.4245,2.0666,4.3515,0.3767,0.1019,0.0001,1.543,2.3406,1.1743,4.5711,2.8286,0.4114,2.2004,3.0288,0.7933,3.556,3.1219,1.1091,2.8491,0.1991,0.8727,1.1638,2.0901,3.7132,0.4579,0.2757,0.0018,0.0003,0.288,0.0661,0.4305,0.0002,1.4401,1.1528,6.3475,0.1576,4.5594,1.2647,1.7245,3.5963,5.6601,1.8732,2.8765,1.2774,1.9745,2.2279,3.0928,0.524,0.6128,4.8743,6.3281,0.8953,4.8514,0.8353,3.9938,3.4838,2.8242,0.6038,0.0002,0.8059,2.4465,3.7611,1.007,1.7498,3.9776,5.8972,0.5756,1.5032,4.268,1.1139,2.5446,3.0739,1.7268,5.2279,1.7672,1.2373,3.199,4.4848,1.4882,1.6919,1.062,1.9701,2.347,1.8952,0.6266,6.5178,4.3883,0.8729,2.1301,1.0961,0.3433,3.3542,0.0003,4.2686,4.3995,2.1232,5.7562,2.4139,1.6177,1.0991,0.4668,0.312,0.0021,0.0002,0.1558,0.0349,0.2209,0.0002,1.5149,3.3473,0.5787,1.8132,5.73,0.1865,0.0281,1.8228,0.5478,1.8897,0.3507,0.9228,0.1496,0.5357,6.8335,2.6922,4.1774,0.8648,2.7337,0.5524,1.8364,4.5474,5.3322,3.3067,1.4798,3.9309,0.5609,1.6588,4.5271,0.262,0.3811,0.587,2.0707,0.1512,0.7912,2.2162,3.076,2.6886,2.2805,4.6327,0.3662,4.3456,3.2279,2.7845,2.6369,2.7049,1.3979,1.0787,2.2571,2.6557,6.8186,0.0384,2.3733,2.3936,3.869,2.0599,5.0773,3.47,3.3622,4.73,6.236,0.6685,0.1561,0.0002,3.4915,1.9764,7.3712,1.2029,6.1754,1.1165,0.5293,2.7649,7.0623,4.2729,2.291,0.1806,3.6365,5.6215,0.0202,3.6408,4.8523,2.8336,1.1436,3.4625,3.6819,3.9268,3.2275,1.7024,3.4364,0.4227,6.9083,3.4559,2.509,3.1872,0.3671,3.777,0.0752,1.6201,2.5034,5.0391,1.0164,4.0711,4.5843,3.4386,3.4116,6.1856,1.4599,2.5683,1.3753,5.1825,0.4369,0.234,0.0002,3.1132,2.4912,0.5252,5.2458,0.5821,6.2133,1.9552,1.5595,3.8067,6.8451,0.0008,2.5712,1.9944,0.953,2.2691,4.2014,1.158,1.5197,3.5176,3.1158,4.7071,0.5738,4.866,5.3262,6.3411,1.0339,3.5313,5.0593,0.2829,0.0424,3.6549,0.7786,6.2595,1.6972,1.0581,2.203,0.8333,1.0729,2.0025,3.3301,3.7862,0.8843,4.8926,0.3811,0.1562,2.3225,3.1381,5.6595,2.4947,0.4657,0.8459,0.333,0.0002,2.2796,1.5173,3.0708,2.7423,2.6657,6.7014,0.3935,0.7367,8.2913,1.4999,2.2581,5.644,0.4824,2.7814,3.8932,6.161,0.8611,2.734,0.7026,0.3627,0.6038,0.562,0.0002,0.4026,2.4317,0.684,2.3417,3.4492,0.342,0.7084,0.3965,0.2382,1.6706,3.8242,2.9071,2.0097,4.3136,2.0898,5.8429,4.4617,4.2551,0.4024,0.0752,3.8633,1.9819,3.1499,4.2957,0.4231,0.2372,0.0016,0.0002,0.0884,0.0371,0.8592,2.5737,3.8585,1.1103,5.5968,0.8541,1.4518,2.2436,1.0038,2.0517,3.363

{"id":2169,"ended":true,"length":695,"text":"In another dimension, the Internet is the real world. This world is split into self-governed Websites. You are a citizen of one of these Sites, and something serious wrong is happening.\n\nThe most significant moment between the US and Russia in a long time is in the year 2018. The Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, has declared an end to relations between the US and Russia as well as the current US-Russia diplomatic engagement.\n\nIn the course of this period Russia has gained close ties with North Korea and Iran, and the two are continuing to develop very close diplomatic and economic relationships. Russia and the UK have continued to work together for military security and humanitarian reasons. Russia also has close diplomatic and economic contacts with the US, which have had the opposite effect because the US has recently deployed its military forces to assist in the Syrian Civil War in April 2019 and its response to the recent Russian aggression in the area of eastern Syria.\n\nAccording to the latest World Security Forum reports the US is working with Russia in several areas, both internal and external.\n\nLast year the US spent more than $20m in relations with Russia in a historic economic deal, or $35m of which, some 80% of the amount was from the Russian economy alone,\n\nSo Russia has made a new and significant contribution, while the US has gained even more power. The relationship between Russia and the US is going through a major transformation, although this can hardly be explained by its diplomatic relations and its joint ventures with the US. The US has also continued to build its own relationship with other countries and Russia continues to develop closer ties.\n\nRussian President-elect Joe Biden pledged support for the United States in the upcoming election. In a speech by the US Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the former Vice President promised \u201ca complete victory in this election\u201d, citing the ongoing economic and political relations between Moscow and the US. In the same speech, the newly elected President-elect, Mr. Trump, also said his vote for Mr. Biden will \u201cbring America along well\u201d.\n\nThe US is likely to be able to build a successful diplomatic relationship with Russia. In 2020, it will be able to have a strong working relationship with Russia, through the process of direct consultations with the Russian leaders in order to improve and strengthen existing relations.\n\nThe two parties on the political scene have decided to have a strong and open relationship in a period of time and will discuss the next stages of the process and its results in due course. Furthermore, it is a good time to be ready to discuss the potential side effects of the transition. With such strong and open relations between President-elect Joe Biden and the Russian government, the US and Russia have already reached an important point in the years to come.\n\nIn his speech Biden has said \u201cthe United States will continue to strengthen our ties with Russia as well as the countries and territories of the world in this phase of the transition and we will work closely with Russia to promote our political and economic cooperation\u201d. He has also affirmed the relationship with the US during the transition, \u201cThe United States will continue to make strategic and strategic contributions to the world through the economic integration and the defense ties, which constitute the core of our bilateral strategic partnership with Russia\u201d.\n\nThe parties on the political scene have decided not to split the two sides in this post-crisis period and instead to focus on common political issues and their issues in future. Therefore, Russian and the US have started talking of joint negotiations. As we already know, the two sides have established informal agreements on joint measures.","token_len":744,"entropy":[7.2408,7.5572,0.3039,1.8231,7.5604,1.7595,3.1001,5.876,2.5043,1.1115,4.4036,4.5335,0.8318,8.9216,0.3958,7.0312,0.0965,3.9185,0.339,11.467,0.307,2.8903,4.5505,2.9156,2.5557,4.0123,0.756,2.924,0.6923,0.3357,6.4502,1.2931,0.9541,8.4259,9.3134,8.0165,0.5516,0.8019,1.1296,2.1585,0.0076,2.2277,4.7056,4.3297,5.7039,6.4249,1.3315,5.8024,0.3895,2.5232,2.2688,3.9501,0.9746,0.1063,1.2037,3.062,1.0809,3.9887,5.9706,0.431,1.572,2.5917,5.5579,1.8344,0.2911,0.0045,0.2302,1.5672,3.0573,3.554,1.3946,0.0333,5.7887,1.1543,0.3097,1.4924,0.0826,0.16,4.3646,1.7796,0.0917,1.7272,5.0888,2.7686,1.1133,0.8523,5.562,5.5246,0.5675,1.5282,0.0002,2.621,1.6227,5.5217,0.0012,1.1767,3.6659,4.5386,1.0337,5.6603,4.9534,2.5467,0.3814,5.2857,0.1319,1.4113,3.399,1.2748,1.2779,2.7744,3.1608,4.0039,4.9368,0.4536,2.9346,6.4689,0.5639,3.5075,2.2661,0.9152,2.6162,0.2183,3.6542,2.7022,1.3139,6.3513,1.0658,4.6724,0.3218,2.326,0.8929,2.9903,5.686,4.2733,1.3764,4.3225,3.3372,0.6782,3.3662,2.9611,1.422,3.4896,3.0312,1.1948,0.0714,4.9193,0.0937,1.5556,1.2788,1.2457,3.0131,3.0699,5.1102,3.4644,4.1432,0.197,6.1166,2.1896,0.7125,1.5387,5.9319,5.4304,2.4273,1.8983,1.6153,1.111,4.9655,1.3796,1.1054,3.789,2.996,0.0254,3.5267,8.4726,7.1984,3.234,4.4182,6.3644,0.5733,0.563,2.7366,2.1301,2.4608,0.6111,1.9502,5.7494,0.4749,5.5006,2.7813,0.8248,0.3284,0.0002,5.5682,0.0459,1.068,2.6862,4.2658,3.2709,4.1183,3.7955,3.1949,1.4958,1.9213,4.9743,1.2794,1.3371,2.0068,4.3643,1.0831,1.5996,5.3837,5.1748,0.0915,0.0511,0.7813,2.0337,0.0001,6.1381,1.1841,1.3158,0.6292,5.4117,2.7943,0.1253,0.2379,3.7389,4.503,2.436,6.9742,0.1141,0.5186,3.1722,3.1332,8.0742,5.54,3.3522,2.1987,6.1787,1.5518,4.787,0.4032,3.9224,0.7903,4.9062,6.3796,5.4267,0.5132,0.6478,2.1301,4.0181,2.014,2.8524,0.901,2.3145,3.2122,4.5712,1.8894,6.4011,0.0001,5.1831,3.8012,1.6082,4.0538,1.6878,5.1985,3.4583,1.9922,1.1039,3.4373,4.7926,0.7898,0.1559,1.0461,6.8193,4.372,0.4088,6.1907,1.1065,2.185,4.4457,0.4133,1.1714,0.0312,0.1912,0.2145,1.148,4.9133,1.4096,0.7562,3.2185,2.122,1.4837,5.339,3.017,4.4333,4.5378,0.0414,2.8016,0.3247,5.3433,6.7897,2.5503,3.9171,2.4657,6.8241,5.4698,0.977,0.9088,0.5834,0.3687,2.4112,1.4279,1.407,2.9084,5.1484,0.24,3.824,2.1493,2.9775,4.9877,0.055,3.6604,0.682,2.5009,5.7264,3.9478,0.0624,3.6221,3.9182,1.0705,2.0175,0.534,0.0001,5.1782,1.9462,6.5261,0.0816,10.9996,0.0914,8.4142,5.084,0.5713,1.1038,3.6842,0.1555,1.0971,1.3383,2.6531,2.1528,1.6379,2.7299,1.6021,1.5511,5.7508,1.4273,2.5632,2.8408,0.2663,0.6965,0.0193,0.5541,0.0013,0.4867,2.5468,2.3418,2.9436,0.0672,5.4049,12.7877,7.5418,3.6117,6.7719,5.1107,2.9668,2.9257,0.6543,2.606,7.7861,3.904,5.9012,0.9776,5.0937,3.6611,1.2685,1.4159,4.2682,0.2467,4.3241,0.0287,0.7748,0.2641,0.4505,4.0078,2.0097,2.2361,0.0702,0.4704,1.7098,5.9672,0.5569,1.2263,0.8254,0.0669,2.6427,5.25,1.9909,0.913,0.3356,2.0635,2.3576,4.0416,6.0145,0.9061,2.1611,0.0162,0.8868,3.3398,7.7719,0.0792,3.62,3.0435,6.1174,4.467,3.8815,2.2169,0.8039,0.3773,0.0001,1.8747,1.9443,2.1769,5.9123,0.1554,2.0485,3.2092,0.0328,3.9909,1.5374,4.382,5.4613,0.7645,0.1862,0.287,2.1847,2.8962,6.8019,0.7716,2.9611,0.6206,1.2185,1.5935,0.0225,4.4802,1.3733,2.5563,5.629,0.0349,0.0558,0.8917,1.3266,5.5117,1.8132,6.3467,0.0779,5.5242,5.9903,1.495,1.0217,1.2836,2.9789,3.0243,2.2449,0.0182,3.3245,4.1504,1.6816,4.7133,1.1811,0.7593,1.0213,0.0002,1.8468,4.8961,4.6382,5.9887,0.3285,3.063,2.9688,1.8076,5.1358,0.6077,4.5193,0.8413,3.7531,2.7131,3.2817,1.5566,2.6885,3.4663,5.5179,0.1481,2.3207,4.6366,3.2407,5.3601,1.8644,4.2919,4.3338,0.427,1.1511,2.8614,2.9948,3.8952,2.8882,1.9789,3.6585,0.0693,0.1029,6.6098,0.1161,2.7363,0.6619,4.2169,2.191,1.3064,0.5422,3.47,4.27,0.8008,2.7835,1.1715,4.6332,6.0686,0.9619,0.2358,1.3986,5.8837,2.2404,5.5344,3.576,3.8499,1.1113,0.2989,1.2766,1.4402,6.5562,0.4925,0.1956,7.1332,0.0514,0.1833,1.4646,0.9065,4.2979,0.3558,1.4475,1.5439,2.1813,0.2562,2.9892,3.9477,3.5453,1.6111,1.7307,1.7272,1.3592,1.0399,6.0375,0.6603,0.0057,0.3599,0.5233,0.0002,2.919,4.951,0.962,5.0238,4.3186,1.7507,3.2748,0.0714,2.8807,2.0544,0.0028,1.8868,1.7963,0.1305,3.5166,1.9997,2.3115,0.2615,0.175,3.0967,2.4682,0.0369,2.2054,4.9597,3.1231,3.4769,1.4771,0.6651,1.5939,3.0335,3.9904,5.5547,0.4743,0.3899,0.239,3.0524,2.4187,0.3019,2.656,1.9456,0.4847,2.1632,1.1527,4.0495,2.9254,6.2947,1.0951,0.3173,2.1368,6.4789,1.7954,0.5909,3.1631,1.4632,0.6687,5.8981,1.792,6.8754,1.8201,0.838,1.2664,5.2301,0.7392,1.1617,2.1882,6.2259,0.0661,6.4551,0.7623,0.0049,0.7827,0.3773,0.0505,4.5401,4.6812,1.3368,1.1259,1.9567,0.3467,0.7139,3.1522,3.2426,1.8433,4.1452,4.537,1.5407,2.9229,5.1271,5.4496,2.8896,3.0174,5.6722,1.2924,2.6391,0.2164,0.803,2.8956,3.6682,0.5246,1.8789,0.3952,2.8368,0.3856,0.2847,0.302,0.0001,1.6625,7.2838,2.3127,0.0368,0.428,0.0095,0.5241,1.0918,4.566,0.0389,5.7756,1.7575,4.0798,2.9887,1.794,2.6871,6.3042,0.5355,4.8874,0.6781,0.7331,2.4371,3.6263,1.4464,2.8782,0.2287,4.7942,4.69,1.7137,1.679,4.4402,4.2616,2.6871,4.3105,0.4424,4.4743,0.295,6.0229,2.5306,3.8934,0.1615,2.02

{"id":4406,"ended":true,"length":712,"text":"Write about a day in heaven... maybe on the other hand... what if a month into life... the world might finally get together and laugh at us... in time....\n\nFriday, June 28, 2008\n\nNo doubt this blog will be so long I might end up with to much to say, and it will be difficult to get this set of photos. I'm sorry, but because of all of this, I'll be focusing my thoughts on how I feel.\n\nSo the picture is from our favorite local craft store, The Bistro and the place where everything goes. There's not much there really, but you can see there was some good old fashioned homemade pizza with some homemade yogurt. The pizza comes in a small bag, but I love how much the crust is and that is very satisfying to eat. It's really a good food food.\n\nThe pizza was $4.99, but with the purchase of my own homemade slice and some leftover pizza cheese, that amount will be $5.99. All the other meals have been frozen.\n\nAnyway, this is a short, but still interesting blog as well. I wish I had an awesome day like today. If it didn't have the internet at my house, I could have spent this time writing other pictures of my dad and his family... this could have been my first weekend home in 6 years. But I needed to make some real pictures for the posts, so a few photos of them are in the comments section. If you haven't figured it out yet, the first shot you will see is from my first trip over the Grand Canyon this past December.\n\nThis is the first batch of photo essays. I will update the photos about my dad and his family as they get posted.\n\nThank you so much to everyone who commented on this post. I'm just glad my photos are all in my blog. It shows just how much I love taking pictures in the same spot everyday.\n\nI love to paint, so this is definitely my favorite piece of art. I'll tell you what, it was actually really fast and took me only 2 shots. If you notice the lack of color, I think it was because of the fog and a foggy picture. And the bright white background isn't supposed to be bright enough to show that there is a lot of water in the background, so I couldn't tell your background off of your picture. It helps me to work on making every little detail about the photo.\n\nIf you want any kind of inspiration let me know! I'll try to work it out with you as soon as I can. Thanks again!\n\n4 comments:\n\nGreetings from the USA! Where are you? The photos I have will be in the States and it is such a nice state of mind to visit here. And there are so many awesome photos. Love the colorless, watercolor print. I cannot seem to get used to these colors much more than I love them all! If you enjoy reading, please click here for more updates...\n\nI love this post and I really do know how to appreciate things... but, sometimes it is hard to find things and a lot of my pictures are on other blogs that are just as good as this one. I wish my family the best of the best of days ahead. :)\n\nI love this photo shoot! I will try my best to incorporate color into any photography I'm doing. Maybe a different set of portraits for her might be the best option. Any chance you could post the pics that you made?

{"id":1383,"ended":true,"length":696,"text":"A story that both begins and ends with the same character saying \u201c I \u2019 ll never forget the way you \u2019 ve made me feel. \u201d [ WP ]\n\nThe book is a collection of letters written anonymously by a middle-aged white man, who has struggled with social, economical and political difficulties. This is in contrast to another letter from Charles Dickens, \"A Tale of Two White Boys\"; which deals with the difficulties of the world we live in.\n\nIn \"Pursuit of Peace\" the title and title are very different. This is the first time we use \"peculiarities\" to describe a character in a novel.\n\nSo the book is meant to deal with the difficulties of the world in which we live.\n\nBut on the outside, this may seem difficult. A very large number of stories are based on true events of real people. \"Annie\", \"The Girl Who Wasn't There\" or the \"The Girl Who Lived in the Shadows\", for example, may have all been about actual events. I would say that we have a lot of stories that relate to real people or people of real world - whether that be people who have real problems and people who are human, as opposed to characters who are human or just plain evil. The characters do not have as much power or as much ability to control their own destiny. If it were possible, the story would have involved various characters with different backgrounds and experiences - some who are of different ethnic populations, some who are of different races of people. But given this fact, I would say that the story that could have dealt with the difficulty in real lives is the book itself. The book is a story about the way in which we view our own lives.\n\nThis is not only for the first time this novel deals with actual problems to live with. But it is important to note that there are also situations that were not presented in 'Pursuit of Peace' (i.e. it was not presented in \"Annie\" - that is, the story is not about actual situations).\n\n\"The Girl Who Lied\" tells the story of four young girls who were forced to stay in America during the Vietnam War through the books.\n\nThe characters in the book are often very young. They are not just an ordinary teenage girl. They are also very ambitious, they have enormous aspirations. They see a world in which they are unable to live a normal life.\n\nThat is why the story can come very strongly to life for them - it deals with the problems that are caused by those problems.\n\nThe heroine of the book is Anna Sainsey - born in 1946 and made the famous name for the film \"No Country for Old Men\" from 1984-1986. She is a young woman who has always been afraid of the dark - she was frightened of crime, the cold and cold of history. The book focuses on the courage and determination she has had to overcome so much in order to become an astronaut. And there are some scenes in \"The Girl Who Lied\" that are much more intense and dramatic, as the author discusses why she is so afraid of the dark, her fears, her passion which she cannot stop feeling.\n\nThe fact that this novel is dealing with real problems makes it an interesting novel to deal with.\n\nBut if you would like to read some more about Anna Sainsey, read \"No Country for Old Men\", which is a historical biography of the British military officer, Admiral M.

{"id":1132,"ended":true,"length":718,"text":"You are a world-class programmer who has died. God agrees to allow you in to Heaven on the condition that you work for him while he debugs the human body. Write the patch notes for the next version of humans.\n\nThe God who is calling me to Heaven, he has given me life. He is the only God that I will call until he has given up his eternal life. God is the only God that I will call until he gives up his eternal life. We must never forget. God is the only God that lives for us and He will be the one who holds us.\n\nYou have to be a master and use your skills to achieve things that can never be said by others. You only want to create amazing things but never try to create anything good.\n\nWhen it comes to work, as much as I love to have fun making some awesome things, there are certain things that you have to do to be a good programmer.\n\nYou have to be a master and use your skills to do good things but will always have to do a lot of stuff. You will always have to practice your skills so that you can accomplish what you want to.\n\nYou know that when you try to make some amazing work that you want to achieve and you can never get it done. How can you ever do that when you are a master?\n\nIf you are a better programmer than most people you will never be able to achieve anything that you want to do. You can never reach the level that you want to reach.\n\nYou need to constantly check your code and test it. If you can only test your code you will never be that good or even get into a game.\n\nYou need to constantly think in terms of your code. If you can talk to yourself in a normal conversation you will never have any ideas that you can get off of your mind.\n\nYou need to constantly learn. If you ever had trouble getting things finished. When you are ready to get things done, you need to always see the best in it.\n\nYou always have to be very good. You need to always be very good. It is something that you constantly have to learn.\n\nWhen trying to get a job at the company. A job you are passionate about. You will never go back to it if you have given up.\n\nThere are lots of things that you need to learn to create amazing things but at the end, if you look at the job picture you will never know what you will get out of it. This is part of the reason for all of these things I have said you are a good programmer. God has decided to give you life and you are making every opportunity available to you to create that work.\n\nWhat kind of work you can get from God? When he calls you back he wants to give you life and the chance to create something amazing. You have to be a truly master and use your skills to accomplish what you want to do. You can always put yourself first and you will always have to work hard for the right things.You will never take a chance. In order to get that feeling of happiness you cannot go wrong. You have to always be willing to experiment and to learn new things and to give up.\n\nWhen you are feeling that hard feeling, make sure you realize that it is not that you are afraid to put yourself in the situation that God has planned for you and that you are willing to try to do things that you do know you are allowed to do.

{"id":4411,"ended":true,"length":718,"text":"You are a world-class programmer who has died. God agrees to allow you in to Heaven on the condition that you work for him while he debugs the human body. Write the patch notes for the next version of humans.\n\nThe God who is calling me to Heaven, he has given me life. He is the only God that I will call until he has given up his eternal life. God is the only God that I will call until he gives up his eternal life. We must never forget. God is the only God that lives for us and He will be the one who holds us.\n\nYou have to be a master and use your skills to achieve things that can never be said by others. You only want to create amazing things but never try to create anything good.\n\nWhen it comes to work, as much as I love to have fun making some awesome things, there are certain things that you have to do to be a good programmer.\n\nYou have to be a master and use your skills to do good things but will always have to do a lot of stuff. You will always have to practice your skills so that you can accomplish what you want to.\n\nYou know that when you try to make some amazing work that you want to achieve and you can never get it done. How can you ever do that when you are a master?\n\nIf you are a better programmer than most people you will never be able to achieve anything that you want to do. You can never reach the level that you want to reach.\n\nYou need to constantly check your code and test it. If you can only test your code you will never be that good or even get into a game.\n\nYou need to constantly think in terms of your code. If you can talk to yourself in a normal conversation you will never have any ideas that you can get off of your mind.\n\nYou need to constantly learn. If you ever had trouble getting things finished. When you are ready to get things done, you need to always see the best in it.\n\nYou always have to be very good. You need to always be very good. It is something that you constantly have to learn.\n\nWhen trying to get a job at the company. A job you are passionate about. You will never go back to it if you have given up.\n\nThere are lots of things that you need to learn to create amazing things but at the end, if you look at the job picture you will never know what you will get out of it. This is part of the reason for all of these things I have said you are a good programmer. God has decided to give you life and you are making every opportunity available to you to create that work.\n\nWhat kind of work you can get from God? When he calls you back he wants to give you life and the chance to create something amazing. You have to be a truly master and use your skills to accomplish what you want to do. You can always put yourself first and you will always have to work hard for the right things.You will never take a chance. In order to get that feeling of happiness you cannot go wrong. You have to always be willing to experiment and to learn new things and to give up.\n\nWhen you are feeling that hard feeling, make sure you realize that it is not that you are afraid to put yourself in the situation that God has planned for you and that you are willing to try to do things that you do know you are allowed to do.

{"id":2809,"ended":true,"length":689,"text":"Two habitable planets in the same orbit but travelling in opposite directions cross paths twice a year just close enough to brush each other's atmosphere. Six months ago the first balloon expedition successfully crossed, today everyone waits in excitement for the explorers anticipated return.\n\nThe launch of the new Orbiter spacecraft, first reported in April by The New York Times, is the latest attempt to explore a planet that was discovered in a series of exoplanets that were discovered by an expert in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe researchers discovered the rare planet with a stellar system called 1.1,500 giga-light stars named 1N.\n\nThe stellar system, named because by the astronomers they measured how much dust they were making in orbit around the star, allowed them to see more than 300 planets orbiting the star \u2013 often as far as 1 million light-years away.\n\nThe star may have its own unique history - there was no known instance of an interstellar space craft before a Star War.\n\n\"We also know that there are many planets in the same orbit that we can see in our galaxy where our telescopes may have been more closely spaced. The star's gravitational pull is strong enough to give us a better understanding of what it looks like today,\" said Professor Adam Shackella, leader and co-author of the study published in Astrobinomics.\n\nA closer view of the star\n\n\"Based on their early observations, we can now see more than 100 new planets orbiting the star. This is a huge improvement over the previous time when astronomers only saw one of the many planets orbiting the star.\"\n\nThe first spacecraft to take off with the satellites was the Gemini 2, and NASA-led Hubble Space Telescope in 2005 was the first to scan the planet in detail.\n\nAt the time these telescopes provided a clearer view of the star than they have had for the first few decades, while the mission was still ongoing, the scientists found only a half dozen planets orbiting the star.\n\n\"We're happy that our mission was able to see more than 100 new worlds around it now, which is a great achievement,\" said Shackella, whose research is being published in Astrobinomics.\n\n\"The mission is now able to capture the entire picture of the super galaxy Aries, where the stars are almost parallel to each other in the same way that we can see stars in the northern hemisphere.\"\n\nThe team used radio data with Hubble to determine what wavelengths they could see, including those from a black hole's light beams and the star's gravitational pull.\n\nThe data captured by the satellites allowed them to further improve the study of the star. They observed stars with varying orbital periods or even periods between them. In the latter case they detected stars that were closest to the star, which also produced more information.\n\n\"This work is a major milestone in the mission and also the first of its kind to measure the distance between stars,\" said Professor Chris Johnson, lead author of the study.\n\n\"A good example of how astronomers can accurately see star clusters is how well NASA detected the dwarf dwarf planet Jovian in the galaxy Satellites,\" Johnson added.\n\n\"Our results reveal the star cluster cluster formed more than 50 million years ago, and the dwarf-star cluster cluster was discovered by Hubble after Hubble's Hubble study.\"\n\nThe Star Wars film was filmed by researchers from the NASA Earth Observatory in Hubble Castle in Texas and the Hubble Space Telescope in New Zealand

{"id":324,"ended":false,"length":670,"text":"Witchcraft: A History of the Witchcraft Society. (Bridget White\/Crown, 2018.)\n\nCatherine: The Witchcraft Society was founded in 1843, and was one of the first organizations to have a literary organization founded in England. We had the privilege of working with the Witchcraft Society for a number of years, and the Society\u2019s early work as a collective has been described as remarkable.\n\nWitchcraft: A History of the Witchcraft Society. (Bridget White\/Crown, 2018.)\n\nWitchcraft: A History of the Witchcraft Society. (Bridget White\/Crown, 2018.)\n\nWe received our first \u201cpublic\u201d request from the Witchcraft Society on October 13th, and were ready to work with them for publication in our anthology, Witchcraft: A History of the Witchcraft Society. The following day we had to wait a week for the publication of the book, or else we could no longer publish. We were frustrated with our inability to secure a printing rights, as we weren't sure exactly what the book would be, or what it would be about. However, as we had been waiting a week, we came upon a request from the Witchcraft Society, which turned out to be a fantastic idea: to publish Witchcraft: A History of the Witchcraft Society under our own name, and to use our own printing rights on the book that we had selected to be a publishing rights holder.\n\nThere were certainly many other requests that we were able to obtain and to take into account, but this was one of the biggest and most exciting requests made of us during the book\u2019s publication period. If we would ever see the volume printed commercially, we would be happy to share that with our readers.\n\nHow to Get A Publishing Deal:\n\nBefore publishing a book, be sure that the publisher has your permission to use the title and contact information of each page of the article for sale on their web site.

{"id":2380,"ended":false,"length":731,"text":"No Longer Human Centered Religion, The Church Is Too Far From Found\nThe long-delayed, or the complete removal of the focus on Christ, has given off a more spiritual feeling than the Christian one that it was built on. The Christian Church has grown to the point where the concept of God's creation has disappeared from the public consciousness and the mainstream religion continues to remain one of the very hardest and largest religions to follow because the Christian concept of Man makes it one of the most complex and difficult to understand.\nSo the Church is currently being held up as a good exemplar in modern Christian thinking because its theological basis is rooted in Jesus Christ. It is not one of his ideas but its nature \u2014 that of the Most Holy God. Christ's creation comes in the form of a physical body and is an integral part of the physical body of God that has both divine origin and divine origin. Christ's creation is the result of his love for his followers, with the exception that he chose to create such relationships only after they had converted and healed him.\nThe long-delayed, or the complete removal of the focus on Christ has given off a more spiritual feeling than the Christian one that it was built on.\nIn light of this, it is clear that although the Church is not necessarily one of the most sophisticated religions today \u2014 yet is still an extraordinarily beautiful church \u2014 this Church is also only a few millennia old and as a result, it has survived to present day. When we look back a few years the Church's foundation was firmly established in the hope that by the time of its development the Church would be recognized as more than just a mere theological and spiritual creation.\nAs a Christian I am increasingly concerned that the Church is being increasingly held back from what can only be expected to be a large group of people who understand of God through prayer, the Bible, and the study of scriptures that are only accessible in small doses. At any rate there is an important problem in this: Christians no longer trust in the authority of Christ on behalf of them because they cannot count on his true will, while the Church itself has not been held accountable by God.\nWhat matters to me here is whether or not the Christians on either side trust in Him because they do not believe they have a clear understanding of the Holy Scriptures. In a short time the Church was established after almost a century of Christianity and it is a very different proposition for the Christian Church today. As Jesus told his followers, \"I know not who I am nor what I am, which is my God; who am I; who am I, which is my God.\" In contrast, the current political paradigm in which the Christian Church is the most prominent Christian denomination, which takes an increasingly narrow view of those who are directly connected with Christianity, is an attempt to undermine a very strong and important idea of his authority.\nIn addition to this, the secular religious order that is in effect has made the Church an institution that is the principal engine for social, political, and economic power in the Christian world.\nMoreover, Christianity is not only the basis for so many countries around the world that are now experiencing the coronavirus pandemic, but it is also the engine of a strong and significant revival in the world, especially in the United States (which has almost 60 million Christians), which has led to an increase in the number of the church of Jesus Christ.

{"id":1022,"ended":false,"length":664,"text":"Scientists make a startling discovery about our origins as the human race, and confirm it is not a result of a god, evolutionary means, or an outside extra-terrestrial force. Describe their discovery.\n\nThe researchers say the new gene appears to have been a result of intelligent design, or the creation of life, from the earth.\n\nIt also shows that human beings are complex and that our genetic makeup may have evolved to match our personality and talents.\n\nThey say we may be the ancestors of a \"sister\", and she\/he is genetically \"sister\" to me, if my sister is not genetically related to me.\n\nIf we only knew how to live together, the scientists say, we may have the power to create the world together because everything we do is a work of genius not only in our own personal capacity but also on others.\n\nThey explain how humans have the power to protect themselves against \"spiders\", but that we do not have that power and that we will always have our own destiny.\n\nOn earth, we don't need to rely on an asteroid that could kill us, and that is where we know that we have no power, that we will always have our destiny.\n\nSo how do we develop our knowledge and abilities so that we can work together, create life, and even protect ourselves from others.\n\nWhy would we keep going through the long term risk of this superpowers ability to bring us out of this earth, because when they die, who will take care of them.\n\nSo instead of fighting each other, we must choose between ourselves and ourselves and our lives, and then we can finally be together. And that is my goal...\n\nI believe in the power of the people, God....\n\nI believe in this World of Light...\n\nI believe in all that we as Christians do...\n\nI believe in my soul mate.

us.....\n\nI believe in all of us..........\n\nI believe in all of us.... and believe in all of us....\n\nI believe in all of us...... and believe in all of us...... and believe in all of

{"id":4888,"ended":true,"length":692,"text":"You are a blood bank worker. One night after closing up, you are approached by a stranger. The stranger proves to be a knowledgeable vampire hundreds of years old and offers you a deal : access to blood in exchange for a conversation every night.\n\nThe stranger says, \"you have an amazing blood bank that I've never seen before. It's worth thousands, if not millions of dollars.\"\n\nThe stranger adds, \"They can't afford your blood bank, they can't afford your vampires. The Vampire Lifeblood is a special product that can be collected and sold in any number of ways.\n\nThe stranger says, \"Now, if only we could get some of your blood in for you... we'd be even better.\"\n\nYou are given the vampire lifeblood that is your own blood and has not been used in years as a normal human to help people. The stranger then says, \"You are a blood bank worker. Do you know what you're doing?\"\n\nYou are provided a list of all vampires you are supposed to have and will most likely be able to identify which you have been working with in the future.\n\nOnce you have identified who the vampire is, you can then take a blood sample of the blood that your blood has collected.\n\nWhen you are informed that you are about to have blood collected you are given a short, informative brief history of where you have come from.\n\nYou are given a free guide to where you have lived since the beginning of your blood bank. To learn more about vampire lifeblood blood collection and purchase blood from this site, please check out the FAQ below.\n\n\"It was the most amazing story that I ever shared,\u201d said Dr. David M. Leitner. \u201cI was the first person to talk to a vampire. I had been living with a vampire for a long time and I was so proud when my sister, who was a nurse working in the hospital, saw me about 20 years ago. \u2026 I said to her, \u2018I want to see this one too.\u2019 No, I won\u2019t be the first person to do that.\u201d\n\nDr. Leitner got to talking with another medical student, who also worked at the hospital. Now, after 25 years at the Blood Bank, Dr. Leitner is still looking for blood as he has been working with a vampire on long term. \u201cI have always loved and supported vampires and, because of the way they lived, they didn\u2019t have problems with humans any longer,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Leitner is looking for a blood bank that can help save blood from dying and people dying. In the next few years he will see how many members of the blood bank will be available for research.\n\nIf you would like to speak to a member of Blood Bank, please contact Dr. Leitner at 410-848-2111 through the phone or mail.\n\nAbout Blood Bank\n\nBlood Bank is a nonprofit Blood Bank of Central Illinois, which provides blood donation and research services to health care providers.

Credit: AFP or licensors\nIt means no-one, if they're an immigrant \"except for any people of the same race,\" can commit a murder for free.\nPeople living in countries including Switzerland, Norway, Canada and the UK are banned from committing crimes under Section 19 of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 2019.\nOn one occasion, a person commits two murders for only 0.5% of the country's population, meaning only about 1 in 2 immigrants are eligible for free murder.\nIt was introduced by the Government of Thailand in April 2019 and its impact is known as the \"Freedom of Speech Act\", which comes into effect on October 1.\nIt aims to prevent people from thinking that their \"right to speech is a threat\" and requires all citizens to be protected.\nPeople can also be given warnings regarding the risks of violence or discrimination, or given warning if they have committed a crime.\nA statement from the Department of Justice said:\n\"It is vital that we do everything we can to stop people from thinking that their rights are worth risks.\n\"Because it is not free speech it must take place in the light of a law that is not being applied in such a way to guarantee fairness and respect for all people.\"\nBut many of the other provisions would apply only to those who have committed crimes, and could not be forgiven for a mistake.\nThe government said:\n\"No person can commit a murderer of a free nation\" by using a new law intended to reduce such violence \u2013 but it also says it will \"not hesitate to act on the law if it is necessary\".\n\"This can only be expected under the current law, given that it already is in place, for the protection of vulnerable people, including women and children.\n\"For the best outcome, all people must be protected and treated fairly.\"\nMost read in News Live Blog CORONAVIRUS OUTFALL UK Covid-19 death toll reaches over 52,000 with 2,500 cases 'SO MUCH SHERIFF' Cops'spend extra time' on 'dispatches' after 3 deaths COVID-19,

the offence could be life imprisonment without parole or a death sentence and it is banned from being used for any reason.\nThe new measure will apply to anyone who has committed a crime under Section 19 of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 2019 including those living in countries including countries where no-one else is eligible for freedom of speech or religion.\nAny offender convicted under Section 19 would have to register as a hate crime, and a second offence, of a crime punishable by life imprisonment and a fine of \u00a3750, is also expected from October 1.\nIt comes as the government is expected to introduce a new amnesty programme of \"free\" murder offences on February 20.\nThis will replace a temporary amnesty of non-violent murder offences called the \"Abduction and Murder of Justice Act.\"\nThose convicted of murder will only be punished with a fine of \u00a3250 and be given the opportunity to appeal their decision.","token_len":763,"entropy":[6.4137,4.6676,5.7738,6.0684,2.8752,1.2215,3.7696,1.1133,8.0745,5.7748,3.9158,3.8343,9.8493,6.2303,8.9363,13.5426,2.8902,7.9,3.4351,1.3601,1.3139,7.9647,1.3563,0.2943,0.2134,0.2143,0.0271,0.0017,0.002,0.0174,0.0136,0.0117,0.0074,0.005,0.1761,0.0051,1.4619,6.1036,0.9855,0.093,0.0165,0.016,0.0191,9.1278,0.3331,3.6619,7.5445,4.185,3.3354,1.5986,4.0519,2.9328,4.4949,3.8114,0.0283,4.2745,5.3772,1.1872,2.6654,4.663,3.5457,9.1184,5.71,1.3488,5.876,4.9614,3.5169,2.2462,1.5295,1.9517,3.0651,1.3911,1.5614,1.329,1.1088,1.6263,0.4862,0.8521,1.1352,5.1062,3.854,0.4539,2.4145,5.3777,5.7318,0.6457,3.2296,0.637,4.1889,0.7992,1.4638,1.7043,1.5609,4.9277,0.0889,2.5704,1.9576,3.2569,6.458,5.0116,0.6392,0.102,4.237,3.2674,2.7652,0.747,0.0197,9.1504,0.7007,0.4428,5.5514,5.3515,3.0649,0.6504,1.1733,4.6356,8.4811,5.2414,0.9915,0.9408,7.5164,7.5093,0.0129,2.3776,1.6278,0.0759,0.5478,4.6217,0.07,0.8172,1.7477,3.9034,4.4489,2.951,2.0934,2.1661,3.6412,5.5785,2.0714,2.9912,0.6773,1.6705,5.6407,0.7756,0.2479,3.7751,4.3859,4.3286,1.378,1.4035,4.6403,0.7146,6.3631,1.2211,3.3349,6.3646,2.2071,5.532,4.3214,1.4696,6.154,0.7109,1.2782,1.5395,4.81,0.8004,4.2738,1.3642,2.9081,0.7631,5.526,0.4397,1.3261,0.82,3.8954,0.1764,1.2331,0.2737,2.4358,3.8119,0.0374,3.0072,2.2681,0.4491,6.2446,1.6654,1.9597,3.9304,2.1738,0.5685,3.2047,1.6201,3.3579,6.3958,2.2533,1.2291,6.487,2.3243,2.9564,0.2742,1.9933,3.0779,1.9791,0.2446,5.0535,3.3849,1.3471,1.0218,4.917,5.4725,6.0545,2.0172,4.82,0.6489,4.0572,2.9606,4.6739,2.1636,2.9227,4.4074,4.8115,3.0907,0.2188,2.8924,2.4512,0.8097,0.3685,0.9837,0.2091,3.16,4.9054,1.2049,0.4688,3.9042,0.1332,1.4505,1.2698,1.0011,2.285,0.9254,3.4039,0.2623,3.3351,0.1941,2.2169,3.0407,2.1102,1.0149,0.012,0.0661,4.1494,1.3524,0.7002,4.882,0.5816,0.4519,1.9989,1.0305,5.2818,10.7485,1.2641,1.2886,0.2458,6.1999,3.3048,0.41,3.0744,4.5317,0.1215,4.6766,3.7069,5.9195,2.7351,1.2553,1.9259,5.4801,0.0358,2.9164,3.1192,1.24,1.9027,2.771,3.4894,2.2418,1.8215,5.7958,0.5154,0.3809,3.1416,5.2542,5.4368,1.1723,3.4077,1.0314,1.6573,1.623,1.4052,0.1972,3.9611,3.8465,2.9597,0.7121,4.9198,2.8129,5.5972,2.7189,1.4011,0.3073,2.096,0.9788,1.5856,1.1088,1.2521,2.047,2.0291,4.1398,0.822,0.592,7.6038,1.2365,3.6731,3.4529,0.7083,0.1673,1.9419,2.9153,1.7273,3.0724,1.1727,0.2928,4.4289,1.9854,1.9293,1.0935,0.8676,7.1738,4.39,2.1499,2.1572,4.1197,6.7695,4.4897,3.9252,2.4984,4.6353,0.6668,6.019,0.0852,4.41,4.8626,4.7827,4.9011,2.5652,1.8842,2.6149,3.5655,1.9063,1.2078,3.1126,3.4597,4.426,0.1822,3.8856,2.5615,2.3544,4.1759,1.572,1.1362,0.7225,2.0355,1.5439,0.1228,3.2761,2.8228,5.7393,1.5172,0.4624,8.4018,3.956,1.2152,2.3642,1.4076,1.6954,4.8807,0.8616,1.6216,4.9334,4.1242,1.9909,1.1933,2.5847,5.5412,2.2701,3.3225,0.0493,5.0143,1.1752,1.8807,2.3672,3.3401,0.6368,0.3001,1.5827,0.5494,0.0876,4.6887,1.978,6.6989,2.4885,1.0457,3.6035,1.8177,2.0043,0.7669,1.0786,2.1479,4.3432,1.7973,1.6892,0.2557,6.5257,11.3391,0.0324,5.2724,9.0319,4.6816,12.4836,4.679,8.4162,4.0695,2.3632,6.5838,5.2969,6.904,6.1999,11.8752,7.8003,9.2295,9.1593,8.2431,1.6277,4.3411,5.4736,6.827,0.5747,0.1805,5.2004,4.5506,0.378,2.1093,6.2545,4.2334,8.2547,4.5949,4.3614,5.3693,0.1384,0.5873,5.5178,3.9544,8.6459,18.9551,7.3676,5.2797,7.0064,3.3562,3.3148,6.2645,3.0166,0.5651,0.7137,2.5092,5.1054,2.9738,6.7488,7.5737,1.8536,0.8845,4.4534,5.9028,4.4823,4.347,5.2512,6.6215,2.8924,0.1697,1.5977,7.5677,2.4219,0.0391,3.2968,7.0102,1.4858,0.369,0.0433,0.0272,3.3851,3.2296,0.0356,3.1621,7.1661,8.3542,2.4921,2.002,6.07,3.6537,4.9949,0.6855,3.7431,4.8379,2.6969,0.5036,1.1925,3.8948,3.5733,11.9638,2.1,6.9506,3.4352,7.814,3.577,2.4295,0.02,2.4569,4.0441,1.4982,0.0843,0.4296,4.8998,5.3257,12.0284,15.8702,10.8665,4.87,6.325,4.1018,5.3689,0.2076,2.8331,13.0493,0.889,0.8138,0.2426,9.1049,0.0425,6.2015,5.2603,2.9039,3.2359,5.4243,4.8287,2.2286,5.1894,4.4354,5.6398,1.4759,0.0428,0.0492,1.0612,0.3275,3.6704,4.6555,0.1643,2.498,5.0877,5.5031,1.1693,3.257,6.1995,1.7159,1.5275,3.5844,0.7787,1.6963,0.296,4.197,0.6041,1.7751,0.2362,2.6977,4.2729,3.5098,0.9597,5.6328,1.025,2.8198,1.5462,1.6264,1.3029,6.1401,0.036,4.578,3.3748,2.2563,4.4679,1.2548,1.5695,0.6108,2.202,2.052,2.8983,0.9499,0.2353,1.882,3.59,6.3952,2.514,2.7333,0.5595,1.5775,0.9317,1.2804,0.5151,1.0057,0.7408,1.5534,0.8014,0.279,0.4649,0.0445,0.4289,0.0013,0.0043,0.0044,0.0012,0.7416,5.3289,1.7741,2.7624,0.2286,0.6478,0.461,6.5127,2.6967,4.0894,0.65,0.0005,2.9494,0.906,1.0478,0.7272,3.9361,0.0931,0.048,3.1576,6.0097,0.2381,0.1606,5.4952,4.7194,1.6234,0.9451,1.4065,0.0456,2.1095,1.907,0.4182,1.6268,1.052,0.1877,3.4959,0.1483,2.0966,2.0796,3.2319,4.8691,1.1583,3.418,5.152,3.7422,3.6356,2.0901,0.2563,2.6945,0.2263,3.8714,1.0103,1.783,0.2479,3.1867,4.9942,1.7958,3.4321,1.349,6.5686,5.9724,6.6328,0.3795,0.1797,0.1557,3.1217,3.3203,2.0851,1.2798,2.0406,2.1093,4.4889,0.0149,2.5013,1.1748,0.953,6.7593,3.4351,5.4938,4.256,3.1353,1.724,3.5272,4.1402,3.575,5.0737,3.454,0.6108,0.3511,4.0831,1.4914,5.2812,3.0615,6.1818,1.3074,3.5032,5.7565,0.010

{"id":4228,"ended":true,"length":722,"text":"You have taken a new drug for the first time. With instant awareness, you realize your memories are now locked and you can not learn anything new. Your brain has been crypto-locked. You suddenly hear a quiet voice... `` If you want your mind back, you 'll do what we say - instructions forthcoming ''.\n\nThe book is intended to help someone. Not sure a cure for Parkinson's, or depression, or other symptoms, is being made.\nIt may also help you, if you are an addict. It may have a different treatment for those with dementia, or someone who has not lost the ability to speak. If you are suffering from multiple sclerosis, or one of the brain's most-common symptoms, then the book may help you understand what it means to be suffering from multiple sclerosis.\n\nSo the book may help you deal with the negative effects that Alzheimer's has and perhaps a more permanent version. With all those benefits, perhaps you may need it - or maybe you do not. Regardless, with each book a chapter and a half, they may also offer you further information or an introduction to the condition that is in most areas of life.\n\nI have been working closely with Dr. David Denny and his team at Pinnacle Healthcare in New York for years. He has always wanted to be a doctor. His experience is extensive and he always tries to keep his knowledge up to date; however, this is something that he is quite certain will not change. He wants his patients to know exactly why they are suffering from a serious disease, and how to get help.\n\nThe book is offered right away after your appointment with Dr. Denny, but for many of the other doctors who serve with the patients at the hospital, your appointment might not be scheduled until a few weeks before the scheduled appointment.\n\nYour primary care provider will review the book and give you a quote.\nThen you will go directly into the book and speak with your primary care provider. Depending on the doctor you are going to need to choose between one of two general practitioners and eight, but the general practitioner is the most commonly required.\n\nIn addition to the general practitioner, your primary care provider will be the one to ask about your treatments and treatments and discuss them with you. Other primary care providers may call as well, if you are at risk for serious complications like Alzheimer's.\n\nAs a doctor, you may also be aware that you may need to consult your primary care provider for information on getting help. However, your primary care provider may also have a website that you can visit to discuss the symptoms\/symptoms of Alzheimer's.\n\nSo that you can get in touch with your primary care provider to discuss the symptoms\/symptoms that your patients need to know or to help you, there is an excellent chance you may have a patient who may need the help that you will need.\n\nI received a phone call back with two more patients who were also suffering from a condition called 'Meningioma'. The first patient had mild and mild symptoms and had been hospitalized for several days. Within two weeks, they were diagnosed with this infection. The second patient had already recovered from Meningioma and has had a positive opinion.\n\nWe contacted the general practitioners, and the general practitioners have agreed to let us take the patient to her primary care provider. We received treatment as described above, which is why they are the most reliable primary care professionals.

{"id":4542,"ended":true,"length":757,"text":"A demon and an angel have been dating for decades. Whats the break up argument like?\nI don't know, but I have gotten very attached to a lot of people, so I didn't mind it, and while she has been an attractive girl for a while, she is only dating because she really loves people (so her true passion). We had never discussed it with her, but I guess she will leave if everything goes well.  Thanks for asking.\nThis is one thing that I find odd.\nIt was really weird to try and imagine her as a bad person only to find out later that her true love is actually a good person, and her relationship was a lot longer than she thought. I'm not really sure how you can tell if she actually loves you or not considering she really likes a lot of people.\nIt was more than that I was worried for the person I was dating and was wondering if she'd actually be really into me if she knew I wanted to find out how long we've been together.\nJust knowing you want to know how long you wanna have sex isn't enough to give you any clue on how the relationship goes\nOh God. That made me totally feel sad. My heart went out to my friends. I mean... I guess that would make me hate my friends too.\nIts not the lack of lust that makes me hate my friends, its the fact they cant have their feelings hurt... its just something I do... I love my friends as much as I like the person I really love... but I get tired of the same guys talking about how their loved ones would be sad if they were to know they would die...\nThat's why you're not attracted to me. If you're thinking of getting married I wouldn't ask your friends to have sex. I think I'll just have to figure out how to deal with that. I definitely wouldn't want to see the people who were close to me in my relationship just for the sake of knowing if my wife is into me. :(\nI would be fine with the same. I know this is a little controversial, but it seems like it might actually be pretty easy to tell if you're looking for romance in an open, and you're probably not talking to an open (if it's someone you can trust or a couple of years later), and that you're not attracted to it at all. That would not be a good sign for me, especially since in a previous relationship I was pretty open and monogamous.\nYea, I really love how you handled this thing, I'm just trying to tell my girlfriend that I definitely don't want to be with someone who has serious feelings for me :\/ it just isn't fair\n>I really love how you handled this thing, I'm just trying to tell my girlfriend that I definitely don't want to be with someone who has serious feelings for me :\/ it just isn't fair  As an aside, I really want to know how OP feels. In my opinion, she probably has a lot of emotions, and the feelings I have for her are probably all about emotions, and not feelings about people.\nI'm gonna assume you've been with a girl and you've definitely been with someone, and her feelings on you are both different than mine. You and your wife obviously have feelings about each other, I just don't know why you gotta be upset at my logic.   Oh well, it's all about her I guess, but I get what you mean.\nIn an honest way, I don't know if she thinks I'm crazy and I don't think anyone I know knows who I am. I guess it's a matter of trying to not be so mean with a guy who is my absolute second

{"id":4610,"ended":true,"length":734,"text":"As the new private eye in town, you've seen a lot of cases that made you scratch your head. But never one as odd as this. 400 words or less.\n\nThe book is a collection of 25 books, most of them written by an expert, including David O. Sine, who is also the author of the acclaimed The Secret Lives of Charles Manson and David Cronenberg. The book is set in a country called the UK where there are a number of terrorist attacks including a terrorist attack on the UK High Commission in London. There are also numerous kidnappings, gang rapes and murders of people.\n\nAfter leaving Britain, he went to work for a private detective in Australia and had some success doing the occasional travel report here in America because everything was in order. But his career was interrupted by the horrific serial killing in his home of three young girls. As the year went by, he began to get restless and decided to leave Britain altogether and start working on something else.\n\nAlthough in the small world where murder was a very few years off, Sine also encountered an incredible amount of danger, with the potential for violent and sexual torture. A series of attacks, some of which became major crimes, and he was particularly vulnerable in his own right. He took his own life in 1995, leaving behind numerous children and many young women. During his time in Australia, he encountered a large number of sexual assault victims. Sine also became a major criminal mastermind and when one of them died of an overdose of methamphetamine last year, he also became known to Australians for murdering young girls.\n\nHe is also the author of the forthcoming book, a history of the crime ring in Australia. The book is a highly entertaining read, as each chapter of the book is packed with anecdotes from Australian history students, who have written extensively about many of the crimes to which the author has a strong connection.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Sine was determined to achieve anything. From the very start, he never backed down, he said: \u201cI knew I was in for a world of surprises. I never thought that I would be killed.\u201d His next task was to learn more about the brutal, savage murders of many Australian people, who were often left behind. However, he added: \u201cFor me, killing was very much an option. I had never seen someone who got such an immediate reaction at such a huge rate, because they got a lot of pleasure out of killing people.\u201d Sine is especially fond of those victims in Australia\u2019s bush crime.\n\nWith Australia becoming a global hub for crime and violence, it is a wonderful opportunity for Sine to tell stories. On the one hand, the British government is making more progress making the criminal justice system work, but with international legislation like the UK\u2019s, they are also getting there with a better approach. A recent bill, which will now go into parliament\u2019s upper house, will also see the government invest almost three billion dollars into creating additional laws that will protect Australia\u2019s women. In addition to these initiatives, the government has also established a $700 million crime prevention fund for women, and introduced a new anti-violence campaign.\n\nFor all this progress, Sine is excited to see Australia in his future. His next hope is to see Australia become a strong and prosperous country, and to see Australian politicians and police officers all over the world make their mark through the positive initiatives they are working toward.\n\nRelated Books\n\nAuthor Mark K.

{"id":4605,"ended":true,"length":692,"text":"ISIS gets more than they bargained for when the kidnap Daily Planet reporter, Clark Kent.\n\nThe Daily Planet is proud to present an article titled ISIS gets more than they bargained for when terrorist mastermind, Abu Ismail Ibrahim, kidnapped off of Nigeria, killed, and tortured in an assault in the southern city of Maiduguri, west Nigeria.\n\nAn anonymous source from the newspaper has confirmed the identities of those killed, and said the killers would make their mark through the kidnappings, but the attack on the Daily Planet was carried out by \u201csome individual extremists.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of our investigations were carried out by the army and police because the kidnappers claimed responsibility. The killers never saw it coming, but we were shocked that they planned to kill hundreds of people with their bombings.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the perpetrators in the attack were reportedly the Nigerian government and the Abu Ismail Ibrahim clan, which has claimed all 13 attacks in the country.\n\nThe Daily Planet has obtained a long list of other eyewitness accounts, including accounts from witnesses who say that Abu Ismail Ibrahim attacked their homes and villages, took hostages, and threatened to kill them.\n\nA Nigerian security official, confirmed to the publication that the attack was carried out by militants.\n\nHe said that the attacks took place at the same time that Abu Ismail Ibrahim and the Boko Haram terrorist group were \u201cworking on a plan to take over Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to the official, the attackers also planned that the victims would travel between London and Minsk, Russia.\n\nThe article makes it clear that the attackers were known to have links with the Islamic State of Afghanistan, \u201ca terrorist group associated with the Taliban\".\n\nAccording to the piece, \u201cAbu Ismail Ibrahim\u2019s killing was carried out after he began working with the Taliban\u2019s affiliate, the Mullah Abdur Rahman.\u201d\n\nIn the article, reported in The New York Times, ISIS reportedly claimed that Ibrahim was plotting to become a military ruler, as they were \u201ctrying to replace Osama bin Laden\u201d through his suicide campaign.\n\n\u201cIt was an idea given to him as he was planning to establish a caliphate on the northern part of Africa, after all, and the Taliban were a terrorist group by now.\u201d\n\nThe publication made no reference to the suicide plans that had been made in a previous attack in London, but reports from London\u2019s Metropolitan Police have found that one of the attackers was part of the plan, which they claimed would see the group \u201crecover 100% of its assets from the kidnappers and terrorists it abducted.\u201d\n\nIn response to the article, an ISIS spokesman denied the report, explaining that it had nothing to do with the militants.\n\n\u201cIn order to secure the rights of his captives, they did not go abroad and not go there where they knew they were abducted. In order to secure that rights, it was necessary to create a separate policy to establish what exactly is acceptable and what is not and this was not the case when they kidnapped this group, which is why they tried to kidnap.\u201d\n\nAfter the attack, the Abu Ismail Ibrahim clan \u2013 led by the late, former President Olusegun Obasanjo \u2013 began its operation in northern Nigeria. However, after the attack, the leader of the terror group, Abu Ismail Ibrahim, left Nigeria, and returned to Pakistan with an army team.\n\nThe attack came after the killing of Ibrahim in Nigeria,

{"id":4873,"ended":false,"length":723,"text":"Every night you get transported to a room where there is an alternate version of you. The two of you, discuss the different decisions you made that day. You have a conversation about what kind of things you want to say or do. You both decide to change your mind about something you did a few weeks before. You are both having a great time. You both say goodnight. You both give up and think. Goodnight. I love you\n\nWednesday, February 04, 2017\n\nI just got back from a day out with my lovely little girl. I never know what happened next\u2026\n\nShe looks so much like my niece.\n\nSo cute.\n\nSo cute.\n\nBut there are also certain moments.\n\nThe most famous moment. I will never forget those first two months at the beach with her :\n\nI think she was a little frightened of the sand. She also thought that I was gonna go get something (I guess I was) or maybe she knew that there would be food around. That\u2019s all there is to that.\n\nSo I asked my mom what happened tonight and she said \u201cI got to go with my little girl\u201d. I was like \u201chow did that happen? It happened. My aunt went home tonight and her house was full of people. When she got home she found me. She wanted me to go there to get her.. And she wanted me too... So when they woke me up it was almost like she knows I was going to go with her. She had to pee all at once!! Which I couldn\u2019t do because I was afraid I might get sick and she had to get it together. It didn\u2019t seem fair at all.\n\nAnd even after that first few months, I have no idea what she felt. But from all my friends I know she feels the same way. And I wonder what she is feeling right now. Not like she could care less. But now she just feels like something different.\n\nAnd then when my aunt is upset I just said sorry. She said no. But when she realized something was wrong, I asked if she could talk. Like \u201cif i hadn\u2019t said sorry would you have thought that? How would you have reacted? What would you have done differently?\u201d And she said \u201cif i\u2019m sorry that you got a fever and made a bad decision or made a mistake of eating a lot or drinking a lot in a previous trip. Why would you forget or do that? Why would you have not said sorry or even thought of taking a shower the next night?\u201d And so when my aunt gave me that moment she was so very proud. She even told me she was getting ready to go \u201c.. and that she was so excited\u201d She even asked me about the day and evening we had an amazing time together. That\u2019s how I see this whole year.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what really made me cry\n\nThat\u2019s when I realized that the past year was something special. And that I should be more like this now. I would love to go back and say that this was a really amazing past year. I would love to share that with all of you and to say to you \u201cwow that was a really memorable year..\n\nThank you to all of you who have supported me through this year. I wish you all the best for the rest of your year.\u201d I hope to have a magical Christmas.\n\nI know I will be writing about the \u201cgreatest year\u201d of my life.

{"id":2652,"ended":false,"length":748,"text":"Write a story that takes place in a world where all people must choose to be either intelligent, or physically attractive, but not both.\n\nThe book is intended to be a simple, honest, and honest account of how, as a species, we treat each other. It offers an explanation of why humans, like animals, can be so different from any other beings on Earth. It also offers readers the chance to challenge themselves on the issue of whether they choose to be themselves or be someone else.\n\nThe book will be available for order on and\n\nbefore 5 Friday.\n\n*If you order a copy from one of the following stores (i.e. the one that sells the books), it will receive an additional bonus.\n\nMonday, July 18, 2013\n\nSomewhere, a reader is reading something that really resonates with me. While it certainly has more than a simple title or an outline that is hard to explain in words or even through a coherent synopsis, I love the idea of trying to find a story that we can all relate to in some way. Not bad or hard to learn, but interesting. I especially love the idea that you\u2019re telling someone about a person who has made a horrible mistake. And the title is quite accurate in many ways.\n\nIt starts off with an article about a girl who has lost her husband almost two decades ago. I know she has a lot going on and is trying to get better, but this could be for many of us. But she ends up being so bad that at one point that\u2019s where we realize the real problem is that the man has made a bad mistake.\n\nThe reader can read the article in a way that is both truthful and honest, but it also serves as a reminder that some people are just that kind of people. If they choose to be someone else than what they choose, that is going to make the mistake even more dreadful for the people around them.\n\nThis is something that needs to be dealt with in any way that is remotely true to the person\u2019s story. So it is interesting to see how the narrator deals with it during the plotline. This leads me to my next point which would be that it is often best to not focus on things you just don\u2019t care about. If you read this story at all, I can guarantee that you will not read any of the other books or stories that were written before you had that specific moment where in a way that can be seen as making you want to stop writing and stop caring about things for a few months and start making progress. What about you? Do you want to continue with the story that happened today or continue making progress?\n\nThis is a time in your life when you can really let go of your emotions. You might have a crush on a girl that you really do not know or trust enough to continue a romantic relationship even if it doesn\u2019t work out but it could be that you really want to keep in touch. At the end of the story, the story you were able to tell will have a positive impact on the lives of the people who have the most to say about you. For this reason, if you are a reader and you want to read more about that woman, I would recommend reading both the books that she reads and the other ones that she writes to you before you read the other books or stories that are published to you after the ending of the story.\n\nIn both cases I would recommend that you get involved with something that your reader already knows or has ever read about.

{"id":478,"ended":true,"length":731,"text":"A new form of criminal management has arisen where the offender is hooked up to a device, slips into a coma, and wakes up as a better person. What is going on in the criminals minds during the coma?\n\nThe most commonly mis-named criminal management device in prisons is a monitoring device, or the devices that are used to monitor offenders. Using these devices, the criminal management device identifies specific offenders who are in need of intervention \u2013 they can be drug users, shoplifter, burglar, thief, thief-turned-suspect, drug addict, drug dealer, criminal owner, etc.\n\nThe monitoring and rehabilitation of offenders is complex and involves both mental health and physiological rehabilitation. While there is no easy way to track offenders, it is important to understand the problems and problems that stem from their use. With all those issues, it is important to be at the proper place at the right time. Most offenders are arrested during their jail period.\n\nCrisis Management\n\nCrisis management is the process that is required in order to address a serious criminal situation, even more so in prison. For example, an inmate that has been convicted of a crime can commit a felony and then have their sentence reduced to 60 days for a simple crime (for example, a robbery). The person who has the first criminal conviction is placed on a suspended sentence. This means that the victim can spend the next 2-3 months in the mental health system, working through all their issues.\n\nThe person charged with criminal activity who is on \u201chigh\u201d use drugs (a controlled substance) will most likely not return to prison for the rest of their incarceration. When sentenced, they usually get a good drug or alcohol drug treatment program. Most of the time the drug is legal and the victim will be happy with this treatment. Sometimes, however, it can take years of rehabilitation to get to this point. For example, a woman who is on the verge of breakingup her criminal life may end up in the prison of \u201chigh\u201d use drugs.\n\nWhen a person is caught up in a prison crisis, it is difficult to stop drug users from accessing alcohol and drugs in the same way which may be responsible for the person\u2019s jail history. In order to address the crisis, prevention efforts are essential in helping the prison population to be in control of the circumstances that surround them. One of the ways to prevent drug addicts from committing crimes is to prevent a person from going to the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nDrug addicts should remain safe, secure, in a place that can be seen as legal or illegal. By implementing drug treatment programs, drug use helps to prevent these people from committing the crimes which they may have committed. In the case of drug addicts, it provides an escape point from the \u201cdangerous time in prison\u201d and also the chance to stay in the community as an individual. It is important that offenders and their families know what drugs they\u2019re buying and how they could get the correct medication.\n\nThe best way to achieve these goals is to implement drugs administration. At the prison system, they are the only people who are being charged with crimes and their jail is the gateway to the drugs industry. In prison, people are able to buy and use all their drugs legally and legally and therefore may be able to use them as well. The good news is that the government has taken steps to reduce the supply and demand to the most common drugs which are used as punishment for the criminals which they may have done.\n\nFor more

{"id":3986,"ended":false,"length":674,"text":"A man is suicidal and happened to be held at gunpoint. He does not comply with the gunman's orders, as he figures this is his opportunity to get killed without having to do it himself. The gun turns out to either be fake or empty of ammunition. The victim soon decides he no longer wants to die.\n\nThe defendant is a male, 25.5kg, a local resident. He is the head of the community, and while he has no family, he has family, and he is an active member of the drug club involved in the drug deals. The suspect is described as wearing a blue uniform and carrying a dark colored T-shirt., the victim is described as very tall and white, the defendant is described as 5-10cm and weighing about 300g and has a face.\n\nThe victim said he had left his home after hearing that there were problems with the men involved in the drug business. He was then attacked, the offender is described as a white man with a tattoo of the face symbolizing a \"bloody\", \"black\" and \"vicious\" knife in the middle of his chest and arms. At this point the firearm was found and all hands were on the wheel to shoot the offender.\n\nThe suspect took custody of the firearm, has had some contact with the victim, and is currently in custody. At this point the victim tells his attorney.\n\nOn April 9 this year, the defendant went to check in with his housemate and his girlfriend. He told them he would leave the house after they got out of the car. The suspect came back and entered their house and they were still in it.\n\nThe victim also explained what the man had bought for them which included a car. He said that he was in fact getting a 'fishing stick' from the owner of the shop. The owner of the shop didn't know the man.\n\nThe victim told them that he and his girlfriend had made many friends with the defendant. Their friendship was a lot like friends in the drug business.\n\nThey were both surprised that the defendant had tried to kill the victim. They also got upset that the defendant did not give permission to her boyfriend and the defendant to go to his residence.\n\nThe defendant told his lawyer that the defendant had taken the gun on a whim and left at around 19.30 to get her girlfriend and the victim. However, he was caught in traffic and he ended up being pulled over for speeding.\n\nThe defendant told his attorney that he took the gun and the victim told a policeman. He said they got back into the car and he was taken after they left for work. He was in a car for a further 2.5 hours and was arrested. The defendant said that he did not expect to have to die. He said he had planned to go to his girlfriend's place for a holiday. The defendant had said that before he went away, he had already planned on going to the beach with her boyfriend. However, the girlfriend did not want to leave the house. He explained that the girlfriend's boyfriend and his friend were involved in drug deals and wanted to know what has been done with the defendant.\n\nThe defendant was immediately rushed to the police station and was found outside of his house,. He was immediately arrested for robbery and further attempted robbery.\n\nThe defendant will now be sentenced to a six month term of imprisonment with a parole officer.\n\nSource:

{"id":3475,"ended":false,"length":672,"text":"Archaeologists find the remains of a machine that has yet to be invented in the hands of a human skeleton.\n\nThe team of paleontologists have discovered what they say is a remains of the world\u2019s oldest machine, the Elamit (Cyril-Sarganot) \u2013 a machine that was discovered in 1848 in an area north of the southern Greek island of Kyrenia.\n\nBut, if they did find the remains, this is far from the most convincing result, according to the researchers.\n\nThe machine was discovered because the clay used as the core of the machine had been broken off. The clay that had been broken off also contained a small substance known as a mineral, as scientists are usually warned of when you\u2019re digging under a rock.\n\nThe researchers thought a broken part of the machine might have also provided a further reason why the machine is being preserved because of the cracks that were caused by the breaking of the clay.\n\n\u201cThis shows that the machine was originally used with a clay core because it was so hard and heavy that the clay would crack, but in the rare case it\u2019s still quite easy to break it off. Our results prove this,\u201d says Professor Nias Hennig of the Department of Archaeology and Heritage.\n\n\u201cWe believe this was another example of a very complex machine and therefore one that probably served a few purposes.\u201d\n\nThe researcher explained: \u201cWe would prefer that the machine was completely destroyed to preserve that part of the machine. It\u2019s important to explain that this is a machine that was already used to bury and carry out excavations.\n\n\u201cA lot of these machines were also used in many other locations. We\u2019re hoping that they will find what they are looking for.\u201d\n\nThe researcher said that the discovery could help \u201cprove the theory that it was still possible to carve out a machine that wasn\u2019t so difficult\u201d.\n\nThe machine was said to have survived due to the use of a special combination of two slag made of soft sand and clay.\n\nAs Hennig explained in the new paper: \u201cThe clay used for construction of an Elamit was used by the same people who were at the start planning to dig a well in a small part of a lake in the southern part of the island. This may have led to the construction of an enormous cement block.\u201d\n\nWhile the machine is likely still missing for most ancient and archaeological sites, which include the town of Velles (Velles), this is the first time they have uncovered a modern machine such as the one found in the region now called the Lefebvre (Mouli\u00e8re).\n\n\u201cWe have the evidence that the machine\u2019s parts and tools were used, and this is good news for all archaeologists,\u201d says Professor Mervyn O\u2019Brien of the Department of Archaeology and Heritage.\n\n\u201cBut before these discoveries, the main assumption was that the machine was not built with clay which means it was still possible to dig it.\u201d\n\nProfessor Henry MacCarthy, of the Royal Society, says that archaeologists were very clear about the fact that the machine didn\u2019t feature any kind of support structure or structures.\n\n\u201cThis is still important data because of the fact that we may not be able to say about it how it\u2019s built.

{"id":567,"ended":true,"length":732,"text":"The Sentinels of Time, the final book in the new series of books, will debut in three chapters in the summer of 2021.\nThe series begins in a small country off of Earth-11, the world famous space station built by the United States in the 1950s. One of the most expensive space stations ever built, the station cost around \u00a3500,000 and was the world\u2019s tallest. The book has been inspired by and written by Robert Downey Jr., and has been translated into two languages.\nThe book\u2019s author says, \u201cRobert Downey Jr. has inspired everything I do: as a writer, to write, to be a photographer, has inspired others to do this.\u201d\n\u201cMy first book was the New York Times bestseller \u2018Silicone Valley,\u2019 and that was in 1958 or 1959. It was really a very expensive time. That\u2019s when I wanted to do a third with a little bit more passion, or passion for space exploration. So that I could be in the company of people who are going to have a lot of money; I got to the point where I went to Mexico and worked in a restaurant and I had an awesome apartment.\u201d\nFor the final book, the author will write about one of the most beautiful places in the world: the \u201cSentinels\u2019\u201d mission of space research in Mexico.\n\"It was the most challenging time that I was in my life and the most exciting. I was at a very difficult time and I was scared of leaving the United States. It was the toughest situation I\u2019ve been in. The government made many mistakes, but to live the life you want to live is what makes you what you are. I like to reflect that when I write I give all my time to my wife and children.\u201d\n\u201cI want her to be very proud of my wife and their children. It\u2019s really hard in the United States to run into a country like this because most of us are so far taken for granted. But for my wife, she knows it\u2019s true and she always loves the outdoors. She loved doing this adventure. I got to work on a couple of my ideas and a couple of others and they got made into a new publication. My story of Space Station exploration and its missions is in a really big way, it\u2019s a place where I am living. With my wife and kids and my love of the food, which is my thing, I made the journey of Space Station exploration a very special destination for her and my wife,\u201d writes down the author.\n\"Space Station exploration was the most challenging experience I\u2019ve ever had. I mean, I had to do it in a very different environment. In fact, it was almost like a prison, because you had to do everything. You were inside. At the end of the day, the journey was really something, because the planet is so much more than you can imagine and so much deeper than you can imagine and so much more beautiful than you can imagine. I know this. I do know how, and I know how, the world looked and feeling. I know how, and I know how to do something that makes us feel good and that makes us happy, really happy. I know the value of it all. Now we are on to the future. So I will write my story here.\u201d\nWith the space stories set in a different era and the books to follow, the world will be open to all kinds of people.

{"id":1363,"ended":true,"length":753,"text":"Stood at the edge of the cliff. The voice does not stop for even a second. `` Just jump, You're worthless '' echoes again and again.`` The final explosion is a deafening blast.\n\nThe final round of \"The Devil and His Son\" was, of course, complete nonsense. There are quite a few stories in which an actual \"son\" gets a bit of herding action and then breaks the cliff with his\/her hands. But for \"The Devil and His Son\" it's this very \"son\", the one with the devil on and all along trying to escape. That's what \"The Devil and His Son\" is about.\n\nIn all of this, that son had to be very close. In all of this, that son had to have really good mental capacity in his mind and his senses to realize that the Devil really did a good job of killing that son that he was trying to escape.\n\n\"The Devil and His Son\" takes this very strong turn at the very end of the film. The camera cuts back and forth constantly. The moment in which the Devil and His Son escape and eventually kill the son, and this is the real Devil and His Son, is in stark contrast to what we see in the film.\n\nAnd that's just what we saw in the early scenes. When their hands are tied around the head at end of the film there is a sudden death that is extremely reminiscent of one of the \"son\"s. There are moments where the hand is pushed onto the rope and then it gets pulled away completely.\n\nWhich leads me to my question: Why did the \"son\" get so annoyed in the end?\n\nThe key to getting the \"daughter\" out of this horrible death is that it takes too long. We've seen many \"son\"'s end before. When we saw what came after the \"son died\", the scene where the \"son\" was left totally paralyzed, for the first time in the film, is a prime example.\n\nThe \"son\" ends up dying so quickly and in such a way that in the movie it is clear as day that the entire scene was set during that moment in what would be the final minute.\n\n\"The Devil and His Son\" takes this very strong turn at the very end of the film.

minute.","token_len":787,"entropy":[8.3704,4.5998,2.1897,4.8873,0.0383,0.7438,4.5427,1.5279,2.5576,7.6628,6.809,0.4035,4.361,3.8902,4.7696,0.3799,1.0093,0.7568,10.7505,11.5215,7.6096,3.5761,7.969,1.5618,8.9572,7.3058,9.9578,6.0512,2.2797,0.0195,0.7186,7.1844,1.9429,6.3636,5.8722,2.0266,3.1653,4.2808,0.002,2.7661,1.6801,3.337,0.0938,1.8285,4.9487,5.8668,0.478,6.4484,3.3813,5.8309,4.0597,2.6714,6.0529,0.218,2.988,5.2154,2.2106,0.0384,0.0064,6.1455,4.0244,0.2959,3.5588,3.1148,6.9534,0.0377,0.2218,5.8621,2.5876,3.3856,4.6257,4.3554,3.6539,4.1683,0.2023,5.2537,3.4371,4.856,1.2886,6.8764,7.2735,4.1434,2.5781,2.7406,6.1854,3.4326,8.3422,3.9292,2.08,5.9051,0.0156,3.1395,0.9589,2.8927,3.5299,5.4123,0.4438,0.237,0.2192,0.1316,0.0065,0.9305,2.2191,2.1955,5.8815,3.5254,4.5304,3.6925,3.5871,2.1043,1.992,2.9162,0.7434,4.7196,4.5059,7.8892,4.3928,5.889,3.3191,0.0786,3.9732,1.6295,3.7176,0.7679,2.1756,2.665,0.2661,0.0497,0.1406,0.0266,0.0022,0.0528,0.9722,1.2969,0.5602,1.4569,0.0002,3.3035,4.5648,2.3801,2.0526,0.5852,5.8341,6.5102,4.2448,2.419,1.8022,5.848,4.1191,2.5785,3.686,3.0029,0.4844,0.3216,0.478,1.5393,1.0426,0.6728,0.044,2.03,5.2852,1.8826,5.9959,4.7552,4.7188,2.9569,2.5239,2.2905,3.2156,4.9253,2.298,5.4251,1.0114,2.3349,2.5011,4.9326,2.9335,6.6041,1.989,0.2165,0.8549,2.7212,5.205,1.2245,5.5605,2.5042,1.7496,1.3105,0.0309,2.2948,1.8715,1.6664,0.0002,5.0122,0.6986,0.1903,0.1933,0.035,0.0037,0.1083,4.7616,4.4883,2.7625,5.0757,5.3783,4.521,0.7714,3.6381,0.6812,1.4537,0.4422,1.7344,0.8239,2.0924,6.1737,3.4795,2.3208,2.0451,0.0818,7.0405,1.8628,1.6179,5.0592,3.7429,0.6808,1.0163,2.6813,1.1919,2.9334,0.0036,4.4507,3.9193,5.8017,3.3406,1.1035,1.9145,2.3401,4.1508,5.0273,1.1894,1.5792,4.9099,6.7076,0.957,1.1885,0.01,0.9294,0.8561,3.3789,7.0632,0.0454,0.0646,2.2027,1.5505,1.8545,0.5701,0.7825,2.0645,0.5768,1.305,0.0002,3.5535,2.2259,0.5472,3.0952,3.0415,1.699,1.6249,0.8209,0.7479,5.9579,2.3243,1.2958,4.378,6.6157,4.3687,1.032,2.3995,4.4435,1.0285,3.6846,6.9183,6.4368,0.4716,0.4016,0.8706,5.0475,0.6492,1.1071,3.6882,6.0399,3.2821,1.7947,5.179,4.0651,0.0789,5.2772,0.4845,0.3278,3.8564,5.4122,1.1856,7.059,2.348,3.5368,1.5654,3.2588,1.239,0.9283,3.5265,1.5061,5.1958,5.8168,0.222,7.3012,1.5164,2.2568,2.7812,4.1094,1.9387,2.9937,5.2465,0.688,1.9609,0.0002,6.1662,3.1684,1.4215,0.2263,1.3912,3.2498,0.857,2.3629,1.8699,1.2822,2.8732,1.8545,0.0576,2.4005,2.2279,6.8356,4.5709,0.7778,3.0107,0.7117,1.2871,0.0002,2.1927,5.9106,1.2365,4.7139,1.721,1.7476,5.3446,0.0828,3.2125,0.1183,2.1286,5.2391,4.0772,1.1078,2.4025,2.7414,2.9528,5.1243,0.4662,1.2673,3.9389,3.3257,0.666,3.4691,2.9171,1.4417,5.815,0.0111,6.0766,4.1235,0.8415,3.9935,2.8863,2.4762,5.7461,6.1286,1.3246,1.7606,1.7185,1.31,7.7038,0.9754,2.5106,3.1437,1.6678,0.8069,1.5506,0.9351,0.2157,2.3231,4.9193,6.3715,4.1954,1.8468,5.7674,2.4483,1.418,0.1955,0.9404,0.9722,0.8982,0.4674,2.558,2.6287,6.9143,0.0497,0.6604,0.9866,0.0001,1.962,1.9323,0.7196,0.0889,4.9169,0.3031,3.674,5.1367,0.9854,2.6112,3.4072,0.3726,0.4504,0.5456,0.0993,5.0564,1.1617,3.7663,1.8337,1.9241,3.6119,5.3073,0.1757,0.3421,1.2938,5.3727,2.2551,0.9947,3.8391,5.7729,2.8928,2.2703,2.459,8.4717,2.4445,1.4331,1.5014,1.5513,5.1249,1.9392,1.0484,0.0001,4.6858,0.2575,0.1309,0.0375,0.0143,0.0017,0.0399,3.2733,1.2809,0.4715,0.1049,0.1499,0.0526,0.0131,0.0157,0.0032,0.0139,0.0091,0.0226,0.0336,0.1739,0.0072,0.0042,0.0005,0.0038,0.0001,0.042,0.0377,0.1119,0.0146,0.0051,0.0002,0.0073,1.1979,0.0015,0.008,0.0012,0.0759,0.0217,0.0356,0.0011,0.0108,0.0071,0.0052,0.0025,0.0032,0.002,0.0041,0.0375,0.0619,0.001,0.0153,0.002,0.0026,8.5987,0.0513,0.0004,0.002,0.0028,0.0054,0.0713,0.0075,0.0027,0.0071,0.1144,0.37,0.0001,2.2695,0.5431,0.1479,0.1616,0.0839,0.0366,0.02,0.0202,0.0056,0.0044,0.0048,0.0286,0.0674,0.0137,0.0011,0.0136,0.0011,0.0015,0.0012,0.0007,0.0012,0.0011,0.0006,0.0012,0.0064,0.0003,0.0017,0.0032,0.004,0.0008,0.0035,0.0018,4.5833,0.0053,0.0005,0.0025,0.0009,0.0018,0.0054,0.0197,4.268,0.0003,0.0404,0.0283,0.0073,0.0112,0.0419,0.0036,0.0023,0.0059,0.0075,0.0102,0.0014,0.0047,0.0031,0.0005,0.0021,0.0053,0.0422,0.0006,0.007,0.002,0.0886,0.0001,1.644,0.1029,0.0114,0.0101,0.0126,0.1119,0.0144,0.0228,0.0221,0.0148,0.0045,0.2003,0.0015,0.0036,0.0003,0.055,0.0058,0.0017,0.0046,0.0023,0.4592,0.0002,0.6249,0.3175,0.0018,0.0081,0.0119,0.0017,0.0004,0.015,0.003,0.0015,0.0009,0.0402,0.0012,0.0077,0.0041,0.003,0.0027,0.0058,0.0049,0.0012,0.0818,0.0091,0.0054,0.0045,0.0068,0.0504,0.018,0.0104,0.0032,0.0001,0.0016,0.0331,0.0106,0.0125,0.0018,0.016,0.0015,0.0025,0.0013,0.0052,0.2878,0.0033,0.0048,0.006,0.0025,0.002,0.0018,0.0193,0.0014,0.0042,0.0003,0.3471,0.0001,0.0014,0.0007,0.0044,0.0022,0.0003,0.0035,0.0022,0.0195,0.0174,0.0005,0.0014,0.0021,0.0008,0.0006,0.0492,0.0001,4.7744,1.8316,6.8763,2.8773,1.1547,5.2563,3.3257,4.0398,5.7494,5.4742,2.6019,5.4261,4.7661,5.6724,5.6948,0.8959,0.0002,2.2872,5.1502,0.7045,1.0457,4.2412,1.7808,0.7384,1.9628,1.0157,4.6486,3.6385,7.36,0.0004,3.6962,0.7197,1.7592,3.246,3.1381,2.3314,0.059,1.7772,4.041,5.2267,0

{"id":941,"ended":true,"length":744,"text":"A programmer working on an experimental AI in his free time begins to suspect it's becoming self conscious.'\n\nIt is a new trend in AI, with a new generation of \"smart programmers\" being creating programs that automatically ask user questions about their own behaviors in order to determine if they are'self conscious' (a very different concept for those of us who are self conscious).\n\nNow, researchers from the University of St. Paul and the University of California at San Diego have published a paper, suggesting that by recognizing what users are afraid of, they can make better decisions about how to behave online.\n\nIn the paper, researchers from the University of San Diego and the University of California at San Diego have published their findings in the journal Science. The project was begun years ago \u2014 at an early stage in the development of self-concept.\n\n\"Using images of people or objects as feedback mechanisms and testing our models against them, both of our researchers were tasked with working closely with a subset of people on an AI that could do with a little bit improvement on what it had been taught before,\" says Phoebe O'Reilly, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Cognitive Science and Neuroscience at the University of St. Paul and former chair of the Department of Computer Science and neuroscience at the University of California at San Diego.\n\nIn fact, one of the researchers and the other members of the team studied how it compares with other models -- for example, the use of artificial intelligence to predict which people will act in real life. When asked to explain a question about the effects of the test on these people, the researchers found the participants were self-conscious about their responses.\n\n\"A lot of these people said they were afraid of anything,\" says O'Reilly. \"This is a sign that there are others who have not yet developed the AI yet, but they are definitely learning from this experience.\" And it goes without saying: The test is pretty different from what other AI models might use to predict what actions people will make.\n\nIndeed, the findings from the study are more comparable than any AI model could have possibly been expected to be.\n\nAs one of the authors notes, \"In the early years of development, the idea of an AI without artificial intelligence came from a desire to have a better understanding of who can and can not express themselves without an artificial intelligence.\"\n\nHowever, since then, some scientists and engineers have begun to question whether that idea will eventually be realized or if artificial intelligence will become a thing of the past.\n\nIn late March, the Swedish Institute for Human and Economic Sciences released a study (pdf) showing that \"an artificial intelligence system may lead to a higher degree of accuracy.\" The findings also confirm that a lot of the self-aware behaviours observed are more about the environment and not the content of the information given in the video and image.\n\nAccording to a paper published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team has now provided proof that the ability to assess what people fear (or aren't afraid of) is more valuable than simply learning to behave in the real-world.\n\nThey now explain that their work shows that this ability is also more valuable in the short-term compared to learning to conduct online interactions in real-world settings, and that this may be true in the long-term.\n\n\"Our data point to a better chance of the test being able to determine whether we are self conscious,\" says O'Reilly\n\nOf course, a lot of this is because our research may require a different set of experiments than did our study. While researchers won't be able to identify the true identity of most people, these results will mean that a lot of people will be asking how they are feeling, and this will likely point to better advice, just as we've seen in the past.","token_len":792,"entropy":[11.7617,4.6567,0.6234,3.0317,4.9031,5.3215,4.4367,4.4946,4.5774,0.014,8.9369,0.9079,4.1984,4.2878,1.6947,7.0703,6.2687,5.2168,8.7558,0.6102,0.0004,3.982,2.0857,2.5121,4.7228,5.3721,1.7785,1.3067,2.2824,2.9278,3.1416,2.4674,2.7441,0.2625,5.8774,3.4419,5.3775,0.236,3.2267,6.3934,3.832,0.801,5.2216,5.6046,5.7903,0.6477,2.6693,1.3778,2.999,5.4511,3.8596,0.7953,0.0165,4.3518,1.7182,0.6635,0.6928,9.0675,10.8453,5.5996,5.756,2.9718,4.1925,4.9698,3.1168,2.7908,4.9085,4.5279,3.0027,0.1563,0.5403,1.7195,3.6568,0.6246,0.5969,0.485,0.0002,4.9617,1.2164,2.771,1.9007,1.2567,0.5559,0.0168,5.2099,1.9141,5.3707,2.6739,1.0735,0.4739,0.0202,2.4033,1.7672,1.5637,0.4163,0.5159,3.6287,0.8371,0.6112,4.0175,5.5224,0.3544,5.7834,6.1526,3.7692,3.0953,0.8406,6.5607,0.2317,0.7154,1.0583,0.8622,3.4505,2.901,0.404,0.9715,1.738,0.5311,2.8152,6.1849,0.306,0.179,0.0003,3.0134,1.445,1.3457,0.2158,2.6943,1.73,0.3472,0.4282,0.0095,4.6806,0.2466,0.553,0.4283,0.2441,0.0078,1.5539,0.1249,0.2677,0.0558,2.9394,0.7628,6.0907,0.6669,0.6762,0.5052,0.5239,2.8558,0.4729,3.1472,5.5137,1.688,6.3503,5.3539,0.0352,7.2933,3.6388,3.5433,2.083,0.1073,2.0272,0.7414,1.796,0.13,3.5497,0.1218,8.6266,5.1985,0.3071,0.0002,4.1277,5.394,6.4603,0.8084,2.3781,5.3047,2.348,3.2168,5.2366,4.3131,4.039,5.6525,3.5409,3.9982,4.448,2.4421,0.5416,6.8525,3.2743,3.0375,4.824,3.1304,7.1154,0.1973,4.5398,5.3714,0.0478,2.3744,5.1796,0.0032,2.0194,4.149,3.1177,2.723,3.601,3.5994,4.6341,7.4686,3.1205,3.1243,2.1432,11.3609,4.4211,1.8227,3.4773,3.0601,2.8315,4.247,2.9778,0.6594,1.4754,6.8286,1.9634,0.0422,5.0765,1.0348,3.5224,0.1606,3.605,0.0151,0.003,0.0673,2.6166,1.5213,0.0515,1.2184,0.1733,1.1898,0.0009,3.1332,0.8919,1.2377,2.8924,0.3779,0.4179,0.3121,0.0271,1.0813,0.004,0.0495,1.2994,5.9132,3.1558,0.1162,0.1252,1.9789,0.0154,2.4317,0.0407,1.0574,8.1181,0.3076,0.5389,0.2184,0.0168,0.6794,0.6062,0.1319,0.0144,0.1824,0.2936,0.0002,3.0145,4.1009,0.0074,4.3064,0.2838,0.1531,1.9997,4.3737,2.6984,3.0399,5.7455,0.0158,0.1569,0.8772,4.9022,2.9301,5.7291,6.8593,1.6514,1.692,4.1516,8.5873,4.1898,0.2914,0.1399,2.3857,6.3474,0.03,6.0485,0.2028,1.1844,2.4538,3.3586,2.377,0.9924,3.5531,2.1954,4.0513,0.4073,0.787,5.4243,2.6169,0.8278,4.8446,4.2343,4.93,3.1174,2.3956,5.7951,0.0598,3.2171,5.8198,1.8058,6.4065,1.052,0.3159,0.8534,0.8174,3.0883,3.1627,3.6566,1.8991,5.0665,0.3792,0.6865,2.5117,1.3978,2.8089,0.9896,0.3277,0.0002,1.5531,4.4216,1.3991,0.0347,2.8845,1.1848,4.9566,1.5119,1.1206,2.0129,0.5891,5.3226,2.7012,1.0235,0.3118,0.0004,0.0019,0.2516,0.3013,3.7073,1.5974,1.7675,5.8747,0.6123,3.9893,1.7833,5.3904,1.4771,2.9251,4.0739,2.5979,2.8779,2.0369,6.1142,4.4139,1.2951,1.899,1.4568,1.2771,4.873,4.3059,2.7867,1.9883,2.4769,1.0145,7.0373,2.8556,5.75,1.559,0.0041,5.0405,3.0108,5.5335,2.131,5.1298,5.1209,0.5396,2.3931,3.2487,2.9743,2.1398,4.7287,4.1676,1.0578,1.6243,2.2446,4.6037,0.9919,0.5693,2.7287,1.2799,0.1751,0.0002,5.5352,0.0066,1.4017,4.5716,4.31,0.3784,1.2162,2.3696,4.9819,7.2601,2.1774,2.4372,4.4316,1.8095,4.4724,2.4458,4.2458,0.9412,2.8358,0.1318,0.7304,0.676,1.113,0.0002,4.6853,3.9812,0.9223,0.2636,1.3817,1.6871,0.4041,1.6371,3.597,1.9319,3.5275,3.1981,0.5019,4.8827,0.66,2.392,3.2888,0.8911,3.8285,0.4959,5.553,6.0018,0.0334,3.7274,2.4201,1.799,3.6607,0.2776,3.4078,1.4282,2.9844,0.9562,0.0329,5.4352,5.7154,1.6459,0.9548,3.0806,5.1826,0.9633,4.594,3.6731,2.9101,0.3004,1.7244,0.4492,0.0002,3.8303,0.0178,4.8715,1.3808,0.1156,4.1233,4.0235,2.4395,3.6953,0.3126,1.5931,0.3151,2.1718,0.7751,4.2357,3.6127,3.012,4.8397,1.6723,1.5465,4.438,2.1373,5.3824,0.0937,0.8022,2.4831,1.3142,4.2007,1.0362,0.0019,0.0061,0.2104,0.5569,0.0002,2.73,5.8903,4.6797,0.2328,2.0841,5.8139,3.3594,0.6229,3.8657,2.9884,6.635,1.6307,2.6396,0.4233,2.075,5.0016,0.9783,0.1664,2.4605,0.2029,4.0332,4.4347,2.101,0.3088,3.4989,3.4959,6.4195,0.1366,1.8085,4.0025,2.1252,0.0044,3.7657,4.3019,2.1831,3.9092,3.8708,5.3779,1.3944,3.1668,3.6918,0.0472,2.2227,4.7629,0.0321,3.0132,6.466,3.8329,4.0631,4.4094,5.9879,3.1514,4.7168,2.0484,1.5163,1.7214,5.1725,0.1147,0.602,3.9579,5.5175,4.8,0.594,5.5169,4.2564,4.5743,0.605,0.2878,0.0002,4.6009,0.0058,3.1007,2.6593,0.8155,2.9549,1.1764,0.6826,2.9094,0.0018,0.0129,0.0408,0.0014,0.0026,0.0056,0.4112,1.0928,3.8468,3.7595,2.2595,6.1223,4.3379,0.5927,1.6904,4.6368,0.2172,5.1643,2.6383,1.2746,4.8855,4.5878,1.7193,4.795,0.0002,0.7685,0.7275,0.0517,1.1546,3.5601,4.819,0.3373,3.9725,4.4353,1.6702,3.8784,1.2184,2.1335,1.726,5.0518,0.1645,0.2663,0.3469,0.0002,4.3134,5.5673,7.0207,1.3256,3.2104,2.5086,2.208,0.3407,3.5907,2.008,1.316,3.2722,2.7762,1.6083,2.523,1.7957,3.9758,2.0684,0.1102,3.9555,0.4896,4.9334,0.4612,6.0222,4.695,2.7596,2.4429,1.3897,1.5132,0.5645,2.7327,2.2023,1.974,0.9205,1.7599,3.1655,1.2551,3.4349,2.2203,0.4601,0.4157,0.8187,0.1041,0.4175,0.2718,0.0003,1.1902,2.5534,3.4409,4.9407,0.8904,0.9012,5.0187,6.041,0.7314,3.5026,5.8297,0.7634,1.8985,0.0032,4.6819,1.2458,3.3756,0.8038,2.233,0.9271,2.2587,0.4775,0.3483,0.0007,0.0013,7.7718,0.0002,5.83,0.0672,0.0306,4.4

{"id":4341,"ended":false,"length":779,"text":"You discover that there is a database on the Internet that contains video files depicting the last two minutes of each person's life. When you try to find yours, you realize that there is no entry for you.\n\nThe second part of your statement is true, if a person's life \"is recorded\" on such a database, the record is of that person's life time. As the world is an infinite \"space\" of people being recorded for their entire lives, what makes up space is often the universe itself.\n\nI don't see how this holds up in any way. At what point do we start to understand that \"reality\" really is one \"life time\", only two minutes.\n\nSo the way you explain this idea is that that time is the total time it was recorded in the universe. That's not to say that it was all recorded at the same time (say \"I just spent nine months on the moon\").\n\nOf course there are many things in the universe that are recorded and that is in most areas of life. So there may have been more than one person recorded on a record.\n\n\"Life time\" is a meaningless term, or at least only a useful, \"long term memory\". It is a long term, subjective, memory-based term.\n\nI just want to point out that while you are not wrong, there are always outliers, because we have always been prone to take things out of context to make things seem more out of left field.\n\nThat's how I got my last semester, but I only learned to use \"history\" when we were discussing the film \"The Wire\"; the \"Star Wars\" movies (as opposed to \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" which I was the last person to talk to about the film) seemed more like a history class for the first few years, while \"history\" was a class for future generations to take.\n\nThat's how I got my last semester, but I only learned to use \"history\" when we were discussing the film \"The Wire\"; the \"Star Wars\" movies (as opposed to \"The Empire Strikes Back\"), seemed more like a history class for the first few years, while \"history\" was a class for future generations to take.\n\nThat's how I got mine soooo wrong. History would be a prerequisite for the credits. If you had an argument for a specific term, they wouldn't just say, \"I know you got a movie that's a short game or a short story of some kind\". They would say, in a more natural way, \"You know you've read my movie The Wire, right?\", because you know that you've been able to remember about the last ten minutes (and the last ten seasons, plus some \"final\" years), and \"This is a time you're going to have to give up a lot of the plot points.\"\n\nThen you'll realize that this isn't history class material. It's a class that's written and drawn and performed by people who did not go through the training curriculum in order to get the credits. At the end of the class, the participants are given a few hours to think about why they do this and how to use the credit and memorize the entire class. After that, students are given a few hours per week.\n\nFor most, this is a small, intensive class. It does not teach students anything, so I didn't feel left out from it. For any of the class, they are required to take a few hours of real material to gain the credits on the job. But you know what? I thought people here loved their credits!

In the story\u2019s opening chapters, Arthur writes how he first got involved with the girl, but then realised what was wrong. READ MORE\nREAD MORE\nIn the book, Arthur tells the tale of the sex he had with the girl, as well as the one he had with the girl who got married last year. In the chapter of the book, Arthur tells the story of his early years in the kingdom. When he was only a child, the king said to him that he would marry the prince and the princess, and would have them in arms.\nThe author states \u201cIt struck me that this was a completely different thing to what the king had originally envisioned. If what the king had intended for Arthur was to marry, it was going to be like this \u2018thing for him\u2019.\n\u201cArthur\u2019s marriage did not happen, and so he is married to this child, but he has no connection whatsoever with it which may be why he is still a little bit unsure.\n\u201cThe King is still unsure if any of Arthur\u2019s relationships were meant for his child, but he is still unsure of Arthur\u2019s marriage with the child. Some of the relationships between Arthur and his child are not very happy, but Arthur is unsure and he should not be worried about this.\nREAD MORE\nREAD MORE\nArthurian Legends: Is Arthur still unsure on the relationship With the character he is married to, there is an opening which the story will tell.

Arthur was also named after his patron, the King Henry VIII \u2013 who was the father of Arthur.\nArthur Arthur (Picture: DC Comics)\nIt\u2019s unclear when Arthur first knew what the prince wanted of him, but Arthur may have been waiting a long time to find out.

{"id":903,"ended":true,"length":767,"text":"The worst predictions of global warming came true, and only the poles are now habitable. Something, however, survived at the equator, and is moving towards humanities last strongholds.\n\nThe worst predictions of global warming came true, and only the poles are now habitable. Something, however, survived at the equator, and is moving towards humanities last strongholds.\n\nIn the past, there was no chance for those of us who had lost the world we lost the universe to shrink the universe, and we did nothing, in comparison, to bring our planet into balance with the solar winds and global warming.\n\nOn one side of the planet we have the polar regions, and the western tropics, and the polar oceans, but the cold regions and the warm oceans are only on the poles not the poles. Our planet is in equilibrium with the solar winds, and we can see that the whole circulation system of the planet is on balance, but there are many differences between the regions and that is in most areas, both where gravity is a very strong factor.\n\nThe cold regions are very strong influences on global warming, and these influences can be seen in some polar regions of the world and in some regions of the world. All the other continents have been frozen to the earth. Our planet is in the equilibrium phase, which will be in a more stable place than before, because we have been living it at a reasonable time.\n\nWe can see that there have been changes in temperatures and humidity of the globe, and we can see that for many of the other continents, climate change is only a temporary problem that has to be fixed immediately, because a system of the planet or the oceans has to adapt to the changes.\n\nIn each of the regions we have seen climate change, we have seen some changes too, and we are seeing many changes to climate, and it takes until we are in the next phase of change, to change anything, but the important thing is that we have come down to the earth, it now has to adapt to the change.\n\nWe know that to do so is to be prepared to suffer, because no matter what happens, which may be on a small scale, most of us are aware of what we are going through, and can do something about it. It is time for us to leave things in the earth for when they may eventually be changed, because they do not just fall in half, but come back and they are made ready to change themselves, and they should not be hidden away, because it is a very natural process.\n\nIn some countries, climate change is a problem, and for most people life here has been affected more than many other countries. On the other hand, the country that is making most changes is the one that has the most climate change, because the global temperature is the most affected in the world today, with a current level of about 5.6 \u00b0C above it, this is in the world that we have been living in since ancient times, and has been an essential part of humanity, since it was a major industrial civilization during the entire solar era, and has been able to sustain the planet and maintain it for the past 1.5 billion years. The only way which we are now dealing with is to be prepared for this and therefore to deal with it. No matter what happens we, the world, have reached a point and a time when civilization has come to an end, and we have to do our lot in giving back our country and our planet the resources of the earth.

[Katherine Sheff\/CBS via AP]\nIn his life, Peter, the world\u2019s favorite baseball player, has fallen off his bike, out of the world, out of the sky, out of the earth, and of course, across the horizon into unknown territory. His beloved wife lives nowhere, and Peter, whose mind is still broken by the death of his wife, is lost to the infinite unknown.\nThe novel begins with Peter\u2019s friend, J.E.B. (George Lucas), whose brain is still in the middle of a coma, but his memories of his home to the people he sees as the closest people on Earth are fading \u2014 and, in the midst of a tragic breakup, the world is thrown more than a little in his face.\nThe novel begins with Peter\u2019s friend, J.E.B. (George Lucas), whose brain is still in the middle of a coma, but his memories of his home to the people he sees as the closest people on Earth are fading \u2014 and, in the midst of a tragic breakup, the world is thrown more than a little in his face.\nPeter is struck by the pain\u2014shaking as his face is frozen. But the pain can\u2019t leave him alone. In fact, he is overcome by the power of his life\u2019s work.\nThe other woman who helps Peter navigate his transition has him in her arms. When she breaks into a dance class, Peter finds himself surrounded by these dancers again and again. In the middle of the dance, Peter hears someone saying, \u201cThere you go!\u201d\nThe two friends exchange some words. Their friendship becomes a love story.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be real,\u201d Peter replies. \u201cI want to see this through, it\u2019s a dream.\u201d\nFor the first time, Peter is free to be as strong as he wishes. But the next day, he suffers a painful attack of a brain tumor. Peter is taken to the hospital by the doctor.\nThe doctor tells Peter he needs to be \u201ccourageous\u201d and get his brain removed. After Peter\u2019s head has been cut, doctors discover that his brain has shrunk. Peter doesn\u2019t believe them, after all. They\u2019re just in a dream.\nThe first moment in the book\u2019s setting is Peter walking down the street with his girlfriend, a student who doesn\u2019t want to say much about himself (she is also a dancer). Peter sees her and he asks her to leave him alone. He makes it to his apartment and is greeted by two young girls \u2014 one more than the other.\nA few years later, Peter tells the young girl he didn\u2019t want to talk to her but knows her name. When Peter calls the couple, he realizes that he\u2019s hurt! He gives them a call, and the woman he meets says she is afraid she won\u2019t be able to see him when she leaves. She is right. She\u2019s afraid.\nA few years later Peter tells the young girl he didn\u2019t want to talk to her but knows her name. When he calls the couple, he realizes that he\u2019s hurt!
