The resignation is the first by a British Conservative MP since March 2008 after a bombshell claim by an anti-porn watchdog that he, along with a colleague, was aware of pornography while in the office.\nMs May said earlier this week that she had no proof the pornography had been recorded by Ms Green on computers. She says she believes Mr Green, whose private email account contains more than 20 pornography sites and has received millions of texts, knew about the videos before being aware of them and then kept them from Parliament.","token_len":137,"entropy":[8.686,0.0211,2.7836,0.002,9.1258,2.253,7.2771,1.4824,3.6243,2.1728,3.4722,0.0112,0.0235,0.1396,0.8078,3.9667,5.3416,0.9012,5.37,1.5979,2.9863,11.5215,1.9485,0.1178,1.0441,0.754,3.9813,1.2897,0.8495,6.1819,1.7136,0.3797,2.7829,4.3655,3.7395,1.5201,1.9459,2.6135,0.6096,2.7339,4.7818,2.9991,0.7069,5.2424,4.6269,4.3738,2.2739,5.4281,4.9355,1.7476,3.5095,3.4525,0.0021,1.8926,0.0079,5.5713,1.177,2.6793,6.4295,3.1718,0.0002,3.4123,3.8033,0.1887,3.0894,3.7209,0.1539,4.3759,5.8968,2.15,1.8497,3.6275,1.1106,1.0177,22.7704,0.0611,2.1084,6.3105,0.4543,1.0652,0.5743,0.779,1.3373,3.1351,4.8016,3.0239,6.5536,1.3083,0.1466,9.3492,3.2373,5.1721,1.7728,4.067,3.3101,1.4278,2.1315,6.3251,0.9428,4.5025,3.2392,0.3619,2.5395,3.7627,6.3065,1.9098,1.6795,2.9319,2.5326,0.0331,3.8517,12.0827,3.2051,2.8798,3.0835,4.3351,3.7331,0.2058,6.2046,1.5248,4.6138,1.1,0.5785,7.5734,2.2894,4.2388,5.0988,0.3833,0.1928,3.5697,4.0937,6.2495,0.7036,3.7844,6.5738,0.3282]}

Foreign Minister Chrysoy Chan, who is travelling to Washington to receive President Donald Trump on Christmas, has said he has no plans to meet a North Korean leader until January, but added the matter is ongoing. \"I am not going to meet any official of the DPRK. There is no way for me to meet leaders of North Korea,\" Mr Chan said at the opening ceremony of the meeting. The meeting has been kept on by President Trump and was initially scheduled for December 14, but Mr Chan said it has now been shifted due to the North American Security Council resolution issued earlier last month.","token_len":152,"entropy":[9.8896,4.2851,1.7514,5.3146,0.8964,3.4778,0.3359,0.9792,4.6177,0.9188,3.1036,1.9994,3.7436,3.1898,1.8463,0.576,0.0012,4.7457,0.845,7.1261,1.2721,4.3763,3.6636,1.4959,0.9703,2.8094,7.4,2.2177,0.6769,1.6695,2.0521,0.1623,8.6549,1.2732,2.626,0.0017,7.2278,5.8727,4.9756,7.7093,0.8546,1.4799,4.5292,0.3633,3.0672,1.7138,6.4436,5.1792,1.32,0.0077,3.6733,1.5165,2.745,2.0866,1.9837,1.1941,2.6545,1.3238,0.7194,0.0983,1.0331,5.2686,1.654,0.0592,0.6479,2.8811,4.7048,2.5052,2.6193,5.7239,2.4615,4.8684,1.3292,5.3655,0.1721,2.4527,1.6119,2.7193,1.0889,1.3545,0.0624,1.825,2.5563,5.8725,2.59,0.5741,2.7951,3.1372,3.5657,0.7416,0.5061,3.4809,2.9136,0.4937,0.0946,1.3284,7.7687,0.2638,3.0253,0.0212,1.507,3.4515,2.1609,0.4858,2.2767,2.0323,4.1987,2.4183,0.1734,0.6745,3.9289,1.1709,2.5013,1.4253,3.6568,0.5939,4.9078,4.7921,6.6336,5.5377,0.7163,2.3234,4.6076,5.0116,1.1217,0.8614,2.3266,3.6608,1.4409,0.5518,2.6095,0.5902,0.9708,2.1483,2.4608,1.4147,0.2114,5.5509,5.355,0.0027,1.4178,3.0851,7.2439,4.461,0.3364,3.2566,6.1727,3.0831,5.4192,1.1123,0.7041]}

Dozens of Muslims, some Christians, were attacked by Islamist fighters late on Sunday during a local church service, the source said, adding that authorities were investigating a possible link between the attack and a possible Islamist extremist group that carried out the attack. The attack on Sunday night did not include the church, which runs a specialised Church Management School for Christian Studies in the village, the source said.\n\nThe ministry said the attackers had been arrested.\n\nIt said it was searching for information related to two separate incidents of attacks on the church and had arrested several Islamist gunmen. Reuters had reported in March that the group Islamist militants have linked to al Shabaab, a jihadist group in the north of the country that was responsible for attacks on churches and synagogues in 2013 and 2014.","token_len":193,"entropy":[6.2525,4.3143,1.628,5.1654,5.0155,1.1503,7.3059,2.7428,0.3389,0.4072,4.1025,3.0487,0.6894,2.4388,7.0642,1.7676,8.4987,0.0126,1.0499,0.9619,0.4705,4.0138,3.3883,3.4845,0.0255,1.025,1.326,2.8528,2.944,0.2383,0.6835,1.0254,1.4338,0.1264,7.6015,0.2336,5.6488,2.7065,2.6519,4.2997,0.5672,0.6006,3.9849,1.8521,4.419,3.656,5.248,0.5306,0.6776,4.0402,1.027,5.7289,3.683,0.7864,1.6037,1.4393,0.4926,0.2556,1.8301,1.4445,0.1791,4.0889,1.7655,2.5655,3.1871,1.331,2.6918,0.4133,0.2833,0.9246,0.2352,1.7399,4.75,3.6934,3.5221,0.6384,3.209,3.9606,0.0013,0.7163,0.303,0.225,1.8969,2.5229,3.3393,2.79,4.8506,5.9188,0.0085,3.462,1.2892,1.9162,1.0127,1.4687,6.9622,0.7551,6.0332,4.3786,7.135,8.1072,3.0872,3.2521,3.2163,4.822,1.3337,0.8348,2.0601,2.3523,1.2514,0.3704,0.2088,0.1863,1.5321,0.0009,1.9167,4.9757,1.9421,1.7801,2.6406,1.8556,1.8161,2.0479,3.0536,1.2662,0.0002,4.1861,1.1819,2.4827,1.1658,5.3415,0.2127,4.3401,3.7913,0.0028,4.7707,2.7264,2.041,2.812,2.6804,1.1324,2.6514,2.0092,2.7967,4.8652,2.4141,4.2031,6.0313,4.8153,1.2366,8.2992,2.7394,1.5342,3.4233,2.4979,0.1869,1.9393,3.7284,7.9643,1.8263,4.0727,5.9325,0.1933,4.4392,5.4688,0.1554,0.0001,1.1033,1.1118,3.3852,0.3684,2.2189,2.6789,4.1344,1.0394,1.141,0.1713,1.9985,3.261,1.6637,0.0032,2.1109,0.8799,2.4054,1.35,2.4308,0.0002,0.0002,0.6628,5.7498,0.8124,0.595,0.3108]}
