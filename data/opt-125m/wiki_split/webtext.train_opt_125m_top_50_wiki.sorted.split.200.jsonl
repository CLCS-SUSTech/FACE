Furthermore, contemporary historical sources indicate that the Senate was dominated by aristocratic class, so that Domitian, the head of the upper class, would have a strong influence on the Senate's decisions.\n\nDomitian did not have a strong connection to those of the nobility. For example, not only the Seneca family but also much of the Roman emperor Gendrash were aristocrats. The Seneca family was also the major party in the Roman Empire, but Domitian only had a small presence among the nobility. To explain this influence Domitian only had connections in certain regions. In one of Domitian's daughters he lived in a town called Alsace and the Seneca family was the major party.

{"id":4215,"ended":true,"length":178,"text":"Benzodiazepines have robust efficacy in the short @ - @ term management of generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ), but were not shown to be effective in producing long @ - @ term improvement in anxiety [28] or chronic sleep disorders. Moreover, a median score of 2.5 (95% CI, 4.0 \u2013 8.3) in patients with GAD was observed as well in those who exhibited a mild & moderate baseline of the condition. For the follow-up, the researchers performed a multi-phase evaluation of the GAD group and examined their findings through the use of a retrospective, non-pharmacologic assessment.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe found that the presence of benzodiazepines had significant benefits for the treatment of GAD in patients and were associated with longer term improvement to their quality of life. Our analyses strongly suggest that there is potential to reduce anxiety and increase quality of life while providing patients with the needed treatment that will be necessary to achieve long term treatment outcomes (PYL).","token_len":205,"entropy":[8.1375,1.7064,0.3363,3.9677,10.1358,4.6987,1.2586,2.1399,5.2893,19.0076,6.5638,5.8784,5.2683,10.4638,0.5402,5.2846,0.1213,0.1222,1.101,7.6193,0.2372,1.5022,2.3539,6.0133,0.9549,3.221,0.0793,1.1932,0.6316,0.4948,7.8778,4.2663,4.4674,0.4776,0.2878,1.4956,4.7865,0.8894,3.8305,6.6347,4.5696,2.0413,2.8465,4.8737,5.276,1.775,2.3496,4.5254,0.0036,3.6755,8.3056,4.5421,0.2147,3.1246,0.326,1.9081,2.7096,2.7297,0.0341,0.3703,1.7567,4.5178,0.1085,1.9161,3.4229,2.7082,0.1767,2.32,0.0592,2.897,2.685,0.5673,1.124,0.0018,1.8305,2.9134,4.983,1.9624,3.9053,3.0749,2.0727,5.0279,2.3002,4.2273,6.7543,0.5062,6.869,4.291,3.9619,4.0151,1.3719,5.4379,2.3662,6.8072,0.2127,0.0055,2.2872,2.1795,7.1952,5.309,1.0648,5.9954,0.0431,5.267,4.6987,0.6149,1.1694,4.444,0.01,5.0409,1.957,4.7893,2.5503,6.2127,5.0452,2.044,2.3464,0.0036,1.8042,5.649,3.1977,4.2128,0.5998,5.2337,0.0214,1.4573,3.2067,1.1584,2.3656,0.0004,6.5671,1.5202,0.0002,3.2767,1.3512,0.5423,1.9142,5.6415,0.085,4.7122,0.0012,0.0001,0.3325,4.8644,3.2415,3.3962,1.7574,1.7556,1.6609,0.0436,1.3613,0.0006,1.8764,1.4032,5.8089,3.0813,2.3206,0.0172,3.8013,3.4227,1.1715,6.0977,4.3444,3.7258,0.0796,0.0064,0.6472,3.7105,6.3388,6.0847,0.5055,0.1135,3.7227,0.4907,3.7596,2.1909,3.1485,3.28,1.6054,5.0932,1.9567,0.0109,0.0097,4.6433,4.2139,3.6696,0.1635,2.2271,4.947,3.0757,4.6649,2.4759,2.7735,4.5014,0.8634,2.6255,1.7764,0.7584,4.3486,1.8954,5.5361,4.3109,12.391,1.5901]}

{"id":2356,"ended":true,"length":188,"text":"Certain bacteria form close spatial associations that are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as acid, on the surface of the cell. Once attached to a bacterial microglia, the bacteria transfer the hydrogen, while they are still consuming anaerobic bacteria, to the oxygen in their host cells. But when a bacterium is grown separately from the host cell, it is often hard for the bacterial cells to sustain electrolysis, which can lead to inflammation.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why the use of chloroplastics such as T cell and DNA as energy sources only works for the short-term. The use of other chemicals, such as proteins and amino acids, will only work to short-term. In the long term, chloroplastics will provide better protection against infectious diseases by promoting circulation and preventing the generation of new infections, but they do nothing for the health of bacteria that survive in the environment.","token_len":210,"entropy":[10.472,7.3203,7.124,8.9559,3.7682,4.0555,1.7896,5.2368,0.4787,4.2451,1.7912,0.974,4.5439,2.0892,6.3053,2.7168,1.3013,2.6942,2.2716,5.1651,3.6448,9.2124,4.4327,0.2416,1.9308,2.6247,7.2412,0.065,6.1375,2.4485,0.3916,0.4973,1.9174,7.124,5.2857,5.1106,2.0906,2.1718,0.0015,5.2904,3.4664,5.684,1.0555,1.6243,0.0753,1.1343,3.3469,0.9484,4.9331,5.8961,0.6661,1.7387,3.0014,5.3926,6.0088,1.7694,0.3144,1.228,1.7244,4.3982,2.0579,3.0848,4.0273,5.3428,4.7245,2.2792,3.1023,5.6038,4.6824,0.648,0.0547,3.2104,0.9201,0.579,1.173,6.2252,2.8848,2.1364,2.3974,1.3493,0.3266,5.7517,2.0517,2.8711,2.6703,0.0191,2.1274,6.6302,7.8863,0.737,2.0318,0.6605,1.5691,0.3326,1.6665,2.3135,4.5669,5.5702,2.3399,0.8292,3.569,1.1483,0.1363,7.324,10.0998,1.0834,1.7924,1.9188,2.3301,1.1613,0.0114,5.1014,1.5386,0.9336,0.0003,3.5918,2.2303,3.2476,0.5745,0.238,1.5778,0.8597,2.185,4.7779,0.0033,4.8653,3.7445,0.0103,4.6399,5.6274,0.0016,3.7203,6.2073,2.8777,6.6335,4.2541,4.2843,1.1023,7.0809,1.9031,2.2661,2.9278,4.8351,0.9023,0.9809,1.0358,2.3483,3.5277,0.0099,4.6956,2.7893,1.8453,0.2701,0.0007,6.2676,1.7139,3.9457,0.0205,0.2032,3.129,2.5102,2.1772,3.7771,6.3054,0.0419,0.0682,3.5643,3.2117,1.46,0.27,0.8866,0.0658,4.1049,0.2279,0.0005,0.0391,1.3065,3.977,5.2257,1.8535,0.4066,4.3164,0.6461,4.0493,5.1892,6.5054,1.274,3.7564,1.9814,5.5345,0.0277,2.8015,1.9763,2.4923,1.8366,1.5565,3.5274,4.1951,1.7141,1.0044,5.4115,0.1667,4.0247,2.4008,4.4048,2.1873,0.9546,1.2049,0.2806]}

Sometimes I use humor and humor to try to help other people as well.\nPlease keep a journal of who you are as your soulmate.\nPlease make sure you write a nice note to yourself, every day, so you can keep a list of who you are as your soulmate.\nI hope this will help you in your journey as both a believer and a person.","token_len":219,"entropy":[9.7493,7.7162,3.9157,3.8572,2.6626,10.1054,12.0064,9.4225,6.4176,5.8949,8.5196,4.9947,7.1605,7.6348,7.2096,3.0735,2.2009,11.6435,9.3806,2.8734,10.1973,5.7531,4.9503,6.565,4.905,3.9356,4.9654,5.6526,6.2539,2.522,8.0824,12.9151,5.2994,4.393,7.2434,9.7738,2.2096,2.2791,4.5441,3.874,5.2702,4.6283,1.0616,0.6217,3.4293,4.6299,0.3064,6.3267,0.9998,0.6648,0.7995,0.1423,1.8293,4.476,0.9353,3.4963,0.0438,0.5107,3.6113,1.5299,0.9653,0.1103,0.9893,3.2087,5.2207,2.4645,7.008,1.6422,5.3045,0.8339,2.276,0.9036,4.3214,5.3387,1.6753,4.029,0.0006,0.7081,0.001,4.2179,4.4312,1.2435,6.5091,2.7692,1.9404,0.0888,0.3669,0.013,4.8105,7.3758,4.7681,1.1186,5.2478,4.8246,4.8278,6.1217,6.8486,1.8017,1.5969,3.1104,1.6505,9.178,0.4988,3.0785,6.7932,0.1715,3.9093,1.0314,0.0003,6.8436,4.7453,1.8255,0.0002,1.5594,2.1005,1.3971,5.2448,6.3013,2.2904,4.3594,1.6771,1.8169,3.2196,0.9481,2.4252,5.5504,5.7945,1.7739,1.5529,3.1173,2.5242,1.7481,4.7424,1.9828,4.6156,2.2166,4.722,3.9088,0.3181,0.1084,0.2877,4.754,0.8522,3.0675,0.341,2.9081,0.1161,0.4082,4.7043,0.5424,1.6362,3.5934,0.2541,4.6645,0.7041,0.625,2.5408,19.2432,4.5797,4.7437,3.5226,1.7155,6.1355,0.2706,0.2083,3.3674,3.7566,5.7589,1.6002,1.459,1.9319,18.9286,4.7232,1.7536,0.9095,4.0795,3.2492,3.9337,1.7385,2.0888,1.5269,2.5978,6.4402,1.589,1.0276,3.0411,1.1454,1.0089,2.7992,2.8703,4.2589,0.1997,2.249,0.0918,0.236,2.3541,1.2863,0.5072,0.0102,0.4127,0.6621,13.4175,3.2636,1.5574,3.347,0.488,0.7955,2.3325,0.7705,1.5502,3.3151,7.6993,0.6804,4.0448,0.1259,0.4914,2.6889,1.6353]}

His abilities as a dramatic actor, coupled with his experience working as a professional actor, meant a much stronger future in the world of television.\n\nBarrett is a character that was first portrayed in The West Wing in 1998 as Dr. Walter White, a famous TV character who is the doctor who was hired by General Mills to diagnose American obesity. Unfortunately, White\u2019s actions in the show were far more serious than his actions in the show and that of other famous diet and exercise actors who were given similar jobs.\n\nMantle\u2019s role on Holby City became one that will be very familiar for a lot of people. With his comedic timing and his knowledge of the history of the show, he will likely provide the character with some familiar faces in the future.\n\nCrown Vic Presents Holby City is currently on sale for \u00a34.00 USD.

{"id":843,"ended":true,"length":209,"text":"Meyerbeer's concern to integrate musical power with all the resources of contemporary theatre anticipated in some ways the ideas of Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk. Becker writes : Wagner's idea of music drama... is one of the best known of the period. Moreover he has a strong sense of the world and of tradition. It is possible that a sound that was not in its original, the world famous'songs', may now be interpreted as Wagner's interpretation of the world's music.\n\nThe ideas of Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk make sense for a musical drama like this if Wagner and his play-makers have had such an influence on them's work. Indeed Wagner's music is the subject of almost the entire's movement in modern and medieval Germany.

A lot of the vocals are not enough; the strings aren't as dynamic as the bass; the piano section is slow, and the timbre is not quite very good. This is a good album and I enjoy playing it.'\n\nAllmusic reviewer Dan Brinney wrote that ``this album has a very strong influence on the other albums that are in the rotation... The quality on this album is as good as its predecessors; it has very little variation whatsoever in the composition. Most of the material is very much effortless, though more than anything I enjoy the production on this album and felt like I was helping this record get that deep into the ground more than I wanted.

The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the interests and aspirations of the Abbey Society. The first plays were performed by Mary, the patron of Mary's parish, on Easter Sunday of that feast feast day, while Mary's was performed on the same Easter Sunday year. At the same time, the Abbey Society gave up all other forms of educational pursuits; for it was believed that, as she was very young, she could not learn and to be kept on by the convent. Thus, Mary was brought up by her mother as a girl only. When the Abbey Society had acquired its first reputation, it had the greatest admiration and pride for its artistic quality. With all sincerity, Yeats' first plays were adapted for the various public schools in Ireland. Most of the playwrights of the era have since left the cast of Yeats' play to the direction of their subsequent productions or to have a new work in the works of their predecessors.

However, in the Port of Ashdod we recommend visiting the port in a short timeframe.","token_len":234,"entropy":[2.8744,1.6056,10.8538,12.1352,1.9547,1.0601,5.8672,0.7184,7.8017,5.324,0.007,2.352,1.9735,6.3121,5.1924,1.776,9.6539,0.8546,6.3362,5.3843,1.5226,3.3909,4.3142,0.0064,8.9782,2.7698,6.5998,0.7762,2.0333,6.4107,7.1505,7.4529,0.9,9.1692,8.6725,1.3409,1.7735,0.0115,2.0229,3.178,1.4191,2.0286,3.987,4.6642,1.8142,1.3613,0.0478,0.0011,2.5521,5.1302,5.3041,5.7076,0.8601,4.0606,0.8863,1.0876,5.4952,6.4659,2.2973,0.9972,4.3456,0.2909,6.0086,0.1098,3.1056,0.0023,4.9256,3.3974,5.2416,3.9517,4.7411,0.0053,0.9629,4.0911,0.0543,2.5409,0.7688,2.5771,1.0791,3.3001,0.2948,5.3573,2.0089,0.6237,0.2575,3.2332,3.646,3.0458,4.5453,1.9483,4.0306,1.31,0.0201,4.7893,1.5363,3.3936,1.5033,5.5408,1.9289,0.2037,0.0002,5.2736,6.4364,0.6468,1.3563,2.4183,1.0486,2.5312,0.7072,0.3869,1.5922,0.0001,4.111,2.1015,1.3402,4.972,0.0209,0.2505,3.3411,2.5743,3.6461,6.1578,4.4232,3.7184,3.6602,1.7924,4.7571,1.2264,4.6133,5.7453,1.6089,1.6697,5.2267,6.4102,1.9076,6.5973,0.077,1.2223,1.5122,0.8441,5.9109,2.9508,0.0332,5.422,2.1017,0.3565,5.155,1.4643,1.648,3.9397,0.9151,0.0155,6.3739,4.9805,4.7061,4.1677,1.9817,0.2483,2.084,1.599,2.1538,0.8554,6.1856,3.9571,2.042,2.9109,0.0149,4.6435,1.8984,3.5263,2.3183,0.0461,1.0188,2.0982,2.3631,6.0668,1.0686,9.6702,1.3506,6.892,0.2969,0.6332,0.0001,3.7573,0.3237,2.4097,0.8562,0.0059,7.8475,1.705,2.0544,3.5916,0.8935,0.2485,0.2058,0.9736,4.2458,5.4798,2.8231,4.784,3.0643,2.4422,2.5787,3.5623,0.6446,8.0583,4.4458,7.2446,0.497,0.8621,0.0603,0.5409,6.4631,0.961,3.1018,0.0314,3.7201,1.7289,5.2267,0.0263,0.4462,0.0073,0.0008,4.7571,2.3575,3.9387,0.6885,3.5113,2.8129,3.1901,5.851,5.1394,1.2974]}

Groening worked in many states, including the U.S. in the 1990s where he was a consultant in animation. \"My favorite was 'Who's Who in TV?' with Charlie,\" he said.","token_len":235,"entropy":[10.1062,3.0551,9.4325,6.3829,11.8898,2.7673,3.2239,4.2042,0.0661,0.6322,8.5715,0.5833,1.3637,4.2537,4.0582,2.3794,6.1493,0.0488,8.3494,4.5527,0.3392,3.0825,3.0604,3.5913,2.002,3.5851,0.0006,2.5768,1.8024,5.6253,2.2185,0.6622,5.4418,1.706,3.5203,0.1641,4.8744,3.2621,3.7509,6.116,2.017,1.6934,4.2198,1.7339,1.8575,1.0012,1.001,1.2304,0.8278,1.1999,8.19,0.0415,0.5746,0.149,3.4767,4.905,2.3066,1.3562,2.5201,0.0834,0.4558,4.0706,1.7942,5.218,3.8138,3.5006,1.7557,3.1649,5.6349,2.7948,3.0739,5.159,4.6306,2.1624,1.4112,0.2089,3.3018,1.7239,2.4912,1.2646,4.6929,2.6302,5.8115,2.0216,0.6936,0.0244,1.5453,1.2215,0.696,1.0577,0.0007,1.9269,0.2928,0.5178,1.2781,4.2562,2.9771,0.785,2.9082,4.4032,2.3294,1.3399,3.4748,0.6942,2.0551,1.243,2.9567,3.0313,1.4395,0.6399,0.0004,3.0134,0.0025,2.0721,2.2071,5.06,1.5638,4.7505,0.0566,1.4571,3.6097,0.5378,0.0417,6.2346,2.5653,0.7141,1.2502,7.8022,0.945,0.7161,2.5381,5.4448,1.4657,2.5946,0.6782,3.7582,0.4008,3.0989,0.0021,1.9116,4.0999,3.1156,4.7045,4.6729,4.8861,4.3683,6.9837,4.6049,3.7018,1.59,3.9439,0.314,2.2096,5.857,2.7401,1.4189,0.2581,2.0507,0.5045,7.9169,0.0445,1.0917,3.2961,2.9897,1.0065,5.4825,1.3884,7.0127,4.2094,4.4823,5.5555,4.0642,5.5256,1.2558,2.3922,3.4336,5.271,0.8952,0.9045,0.0161,0.0014,0.0382,1.166,2.3666,4.7829,4.0841,0.5686,4.6699,4.1299,1.6357,0.4685,0.1604,2.6196,0.0023,4.8515,2.7838,5.6749,6.7539,1.8731,1.1978,3.714,2.3577,0.0022,0.1844,0.9834,3.0609,1.0941,3.7517,0.0182,6.3509,0.2916,2.0962,1.8184,4.1939,3.5322,5.0548,1.7423,2.7232,3.2932,4.3182,3.7839,1.8794,6.3411,1.4712,3.2779,1.7973,4.5784,1.1077,5.0091,4.7866,2.0212,0.6034,0.2226,0.1073]}

The earlier Picts appear to have had a considerable amount of silver available, probably from raiding further south, or the payment of subsidies to the industry which was the main basis for the growth of the gold settlement industry.\n\nA gold settlement of silver, usually of tin, has been an attractive method for wealth generation. Although copper and zinc have been extensively mined in Pictland for some hundreds of years, the wealth derived from these metalwork has not been widely disseminated. A number of these are still held in our memory.\n\nA rich metal and mineral trade in Pictland is one of the great and only successful industrial centres of our modern times. One of our biggest commercial successes is that there are numerous mining and quarry facilities in Pictland. With nearly two million people in its town today, it is a true market place.

The Kneppenfocken was a place to listen to music, watch movies, take photographs and make beautiful art.\n\nKlein is currently living in the city, and is looking forward to working with both the artists and the community around him.\n\nThe full article can be found at www.bornZagreb.net","token_len":237,"entropy":[9.1665,10.254,1.6078,2.6151,10.4544,14.0875,9.5813,5.679,11.133,7.7191,3.8892,0.1077,7.5279,1.4786,3.7173,5.9525,0.824,2.6533,0.9993,7.0802,2.4331,5.9219,3.0798,1.971,7.9063,0.2464,12.5945,9.378,0.4475,0.5222,7.86,1.1974,1.6509,1.0892,0.9021,7.3868,0.1533,0.0004,10.3812,10.6743,6.2786,4.5595,2.1868,4.0557,4.8413,5.9853,5.1697,6.0249,11.8768,3.5198,7.2703,3.4636,2.3159,6.0592,6.3644,2.5316,3.0424,2.0921,1.5278,3.8109,3.8739,1.9859,3.3101,3.06,5.3736,4.6161,2.6778,2.9028,4.2182,1.0131,4.6686,3.5214,3.8104,5.4936,2.0281,9.1046,0.0588,6.1355,1.0863,5.7334,5.5955,0.2446,1.4545,0.0246,3.3012,2.3056,5.8256,0.2958,3.0384,0.4286,1.2654,4.2251,1.0289,3.1015,5.2199,1.0944,0.389,1.1147,1.3783,2.6907,4.9311,4.6772,4.8217,5.7866,9.8702,2.2653,2.6458,1.9998,2.6117,0.2747,1.0859,0.7029,0.1047,3.8606,1.4273,2.8486,7.1953,1.2333,6.3711,0.2379,1.8587,1.0194,3.5608,2.7185,3.7216,2.9362,2.5461,4.7117,0.6131,2.7999,0.0492,1.0834,3.0915,4.0669,1.4313,1.7357,4.0743,2.1569,5.4049,5.2558,5.0724,4.1555,6.1777,5.2849,3.2923,2.1336,0.7225,0.9265,2.0006,0.0002,1.6333,5.7878,2.3445,0.1626,1.0025,0.4613,2.4968,1.6757,5.8421,2.1109,1.7796,1.6369,5.0356,1.7168,6.2899,0.6046,1.6469,1.3533,2.4585,0.0074,0.0043,0.0035,0.0036,0.0016,1.978,2.844,2.9865,2.4255,5.1134,0.3107,0.7583,0.8913,4.5339,1.8985,0.5969,4.0421,3.6717,1.242,4.6511,5.2222,1.838,1.0766,1.6081,0.0002,2.4857,0.196,3.6523,2.1114,4.2749,0.3572,2.2619,2.6825,2.2217,1.6421,2.29,3.2752,0.5518,0.0087,2.6699,0.6114,6.0153,1.3948,3.5105,0.3548,0.5881,1.4533,5.3195,1.4557,0.4125,0.7515,0.0002,2.4633,6.5158,4.2566,0.8251,0.0107,0.444,1.6718,2.0428,0.0008,5.9961,3.384,0.051,0.0012,0.1798,2.7086]}

In turn, the songwriter began to seek out further influences from his musical roots that could be heard in his performance work.","token_len":238,"entropy":[2.9307,8.4628,3.6248,1.7146,0.1064,1.4426,12.17,10.8673,1.8069,3.0468,6.1087,6.0112,4.3698,1.3612,9.3918,3.5264,1.6025,1.5138,6.5644,5.1264,0.6819,9.9768,7.0957,0.3293,0.375,1.3432,2.0217,2.643,3.9875,3.2749,5.987,4.2796,0.0866,4.3814,1.4683,7.6531,0.354,7.5114,5.6883,0.0587,0.4234,0.7885,2.0896,3.4959,0.6145,1.9135,2.9044,0.0208,0.0053,3.395,4.8764,5.2387,8.0525,2.5869,2.9683,0.5761,1.565,4.3435,2.4024,8.4065,2.3848,0.124,0.0492,0.1086,0.9029,2.6373,6.5945,5.2124,0.5191,1.801,11.4288,3.8803,1.0066,0.8099,3.2644,2.9962,5.2253,5.0669,0.1029,4.1937,0.1302,5.2151,6.4272,2.8489,0.7004,2.3741,3.4422,3.5158,2.6942,4.571,1.1409,1.6064,3.466,0.0769,0.0156,0.6925,0.0309,0.0047,1.8713,1.5745,3.3374,4.5577,0.2195,0.7556,6.8147,5.6813,2.6812,1.5224,4.2376,3.6577,1.9697,5.2554,0.0049,6.0608,6.2068,3.3765,0.9835,4.8584,0.3302,1.2344,9.212,1.685,6.3647,4.5788,0.0054,0.0068,0.1092,0.0079,0.0057,6.0132,3.1054,2.083,3.1877,0.6459,1.545,6.0017,4.164,0.7037,0.7842,6.5647,4.6362,4.6488,7.8218,6.1706,3.1973,4.6644,5.6033,3.4183,5.2399,1.4459,1.0849,3.2989,4.8414,3.5984,2.7981,6.5335,1.1983,3.4043,3.4948,1.5563,0.005,0.0645,4.0742,0.0636,0.5309,1.2812,4.0055,4.0364,0.9378,4.7985,3.5317,1.7472,0.3135,2.3018,1.9335,0.8046,1.7846,0.0002,5.4901,2.8908,5.4385,4.3805,0.914,1.003,1.8303,0.0018,0.0049,0.0688,0.0022,0.0031,4.4525,0.759,4.858,1.0141,2.5216,4.4114,4.3257,0.2779,6.951,0.501,0.7142,1.4258,1.9376,2.2123,5.1375,3.8468,0.0233,0.1128,0.7957,0.0092,0.0954,0.5035,2.4286,5.333,0.0622,1.2155,3.2283,1.0443,1.6653,0.2381,5.6048,0.8095,6.6087,4.7314,1.7053,4.3547,5.1091,4.8081,5.2378,2.8226,1.364,3.4401,0.8375,3.2579,7.6934,5.3535,0.5126]}

{"id":2933,"ended":false,"length":219,"text":"The most common source of new genes in eukaryotic lineages is gene duplication, which creates copy number variation of an existing gene in the genome. The resulting genes ( paralogs ) may then produce the identical gene in the next gene. This can occur a variety of ways including mutation, modification, removal, recombination, or genetic recombination. There are several related, common processes in eukaryotic lineages \u2013 i.e. mutation, alteration, recombination, or gene duplication. For example, mutations, alterations, or recombination in DNA and DNA sequences are all linked by a mechanism called duplication and are not necessarily related to chromosome disorders due to DNA and DNA sequences.\n\nGene duplication is normally carried out on individual sites of DNA or DNA sequences in order to allow a more diverse number of chromosomes. This is usually done using the most common sequencing methods and usually involves a simple sequencing approach with minimal time requirements. However, due to the short time required to complete a genomic sequence, genomic sequencing and sequencing is very often inaccurate, and a large number of replications may take years.

It is much, much more electronegative than tin or bismuth, which are the best known bismuth. The difference is that tin is a much longer metal, and the two are separated by a very long distance and are very different because by that time, bismuth is more valuable than tin. What is unique about bismuth is that it is relatively thin, yet it is the most visible and most interesting material in the mineral.\n\nThe theory then seems to make it seem that a certain percentage of the average antimony content is a consequence of the antimony's short-cut length, and that in the case of tin that is inversely proportional to both bismuth and tin.

Unlike older game recordings that were recorded in the US, it incorporated more of a melodic approach and more of the piano notes that have usually been used by American artists. The first time out, the duo was inspired by \"A New Way To Live\" by James Brown and the opening notes of \"You Don't Know You\" are \"Piano\", which is the title track of their third CD.\nNow, thanks to the help of some of the best voices in the world, we have a new version of \"You Don't Know You\", which is currently only available in select stores and plays a rather different version on YouTube. This version is available for streaming today in select UK and US marketplaces.\nWatch the official music video for \"You Don't Know You\" above.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video and that we will do so again in a month or so, so watch this space. Until then, you can find out more regarding the new version of \"You Don't Know You\" below.","token_len":244,"entropy":[3.3302,1.7329,5.879,0.2486,0.0747,0.0466,12.788,1.315,13.0718,4.0356,2.0434,10.0231,4.6162,1.4388,1.3094,5.8668,3.7306,2.2596,6.7201,0.3972,10.6281,11.6083,9.0566,3.0904,4.9429,4.3052,1.9677,0.413,7.8294,8.0537,7.9688,1.5034,5.6922,8.5181,3.5583,0.0542,0.6599,7.3226,7.9331,9.6002,4.008,3.078,1.9235,3.3827,1.7297,1.5468,4.3096,0.6727,4.0501,7.0097,4.514,1.6729,1.6176,5.3399,0.0098,2.5322,2.4681,2.9454,1.5225,2.6596,5.5832,5.0705,2.815,3.6567,7.003,0.35,1.8943,2.8017,3.9606,3.2811,1.0653,1.9366,4.199,4.4411,8.4689,1.9154,1.5469,4.6848,3.3138,3.9413,0.3406,4.4593,4.3469,4.1282,4.3434,2.9997,1.7281,1.0497,0.3419,4.1878,2.106,1.8899,2.2837,5.5407,5.0156,0.8378,0.9907,4.7308,2.9789,0.0026,0.9979,4.6974,6.3267,2.6687,4.0274,5.3357,3.6373,5.0935,2.8563,1.6784,2.07,3.997,0.7007,0.8858,1.8019,4.4736,6.2822,0.9423,1.4635,9.6675,1.3101,5.2474,0.0253,1.354,4.8137,0.0599,3.9307,2.1189,0.605,1.9975,4.9856,0.8229,0.6079,0.4956,0.3365,2.7091,1.617,1.7029,1.7487,1.7981,0.1979,1.5292,3.0403,0.0333,0.0005,0.0017,0.0163,2.0216,1.6396,1.4133,5.2729,5.4092,0.148,1.6327,5.5866,2.1062,1.9207,8.0546,4.037,6.3212,4.1424,2.3644,3.3185,4.7906,0.5945,3.1145,1.2717,1.4652,3.4237,1.562,3.7302,5.2867,3.5826,3.0232,4.5636,1.494,1.5243,6.959,0.8271,0.8083,0.9515,6.419,0.7732,5.4556,4.2932,0.0457,1.1057,0.559,0.0577,0.0039,0.0003,0.0015,0.0032,0.3276,3.7345,0.6519,0.7584,4.2127,2.1596,0.578,1.7004,1.1068,2.35,1.2377,3.1439,2.4395,2.2845,4.5766,6.0299,0.9324,1.5524,3.3032,5.6245,0.354,0.5674,2.3621,1.883,6.5924,2.6642,1.6441,1.5245,4.654,0.4456,0.0877,3.6297,0.3559,2.4573,1.6784,0.6672,8.0323,0.9551,2.8683,1.504,0.5597,0.4425,0.0198,0.0028,0.0002,0.0016,0.0071,0.6453,2.1709,0.4333]}
{"id":2919,"ended":true,"length":230,"text":"The theories developed in the 1930s and 1940s to integrate molecular genetics with Darwinian evolution are called the modern evolutionary synthesis, a term introduced by Julian Huxley. Evolutionary biologists subsequently refined this concept by using molecular genetics as a basis for experiments. Modern evolutionary scientists consider molecular genetics to be the foundation of modern biology, and its central assumptions about the biology of human physiology have been the subject of ongoing revision of the theory by scientists involved in studies of physiology and the molecular environment.\n\nElements within the molecular dynamics theory system may help explain why Darwinian evolution took place. It is important to understand the evolution of evolutionary biology, and to understand what it means to be Darwinian. For example, if evolution had occurred before the formation of Darwinian evolution, there may have been a time period in which the evolutionary change was not sufficiently abrupt. This may make biological evolution inevitable and possible at a later stage. Evolutionary ecology should reflect the dynamics of biodiversity, animal reproduction, and even evolution of human evolution.\n\nIf we can learn to understand both evolution and natural selection, we can begin to create a better understanding of evolutionary biology that will have a long and meaningful life form, or life for us all.","token_len":245,"entropy":[10.6498,6.5004,2.2849,1.0875,4.2766,0.1115,1.9024,0.5794,0.0002,4.3302,8.473,6.8647,2.9635,1.4254,6.7276,0.3014,1.4916,2.5859,5.3191,1.4541,6.0715,3.1408,8.4105,2.3531,3.3317,1.6014,6.5983,0.6168,8.2608,2.8698,0.0681,0.0002,3.0339,5.1718,0.7727,3.4588,8.1121,6.2376,2.6162,2.2747,1.8655,2.4932,2.6653,1.4094,1.9152,0.61,3.0152,0.2651,6.8578,2.9243,5.9007,1.1733,3.1061,5.2127,1.5176,0.4436,0.7327,0.1817,1.2757,2.9347,0.605,2.6921,1.4517,1.238,1.3398,4.0914,5.652,5.6559,3.0339,1.4684,3.8404,0.0676,4.3342,5.3924,2.6506,0.6842,4.8244,1.3674,0.0018,5.5585,4.6123,6.0358,1.6012,2.3754,3.8183,3.6266,6.9161,0.1073,6.5855,0.3319,5.9227,1.2381,2.9646,3.4123,3.1027,0.264,1.033,0.0008,6.0484,3.199,5.9078,0.9536,2.9434,5.8128,2.6794,7.9576,4.8368,4.5366,0.6498,1.9925,4.5002,1.1587,0.2123,3.9568,0.8729,1.0178,3.4488,0.8824,2.8933,0.1147,1.9991,1.3818,3.0448,0.1774,3.9076,3.03,1.8646,1.3271,1.7632,1.3298,2.9427,2.8534,1.1494,0.8317,1.0552,5.0768,0.0316,0.5285,4.1561,1.5716,0.0269,3.9292,2.1284,3.7477,2.4781,3.2044,1.3494,3.5644,0.0109,5.6145,0.2228,0.9334,0.2107,3.5271,3.0534,0.3779,0.0443,1.9158,4.0314,2.0613,1.8832,0.3607,1.663,3.0843,6.2451,1.9421,2.4508,5.0262,3.0355,1.8453,2.684,2.1086,5.94,5.0539,1.6064,5.8,2.5674,5.0914,4.4704,2.2069,1.6532,1.7577,1.3183,3.1969,0.2979,7.8554,5.2849,5.1323,1.0212,5.1066,0.1832,7.0874,1.2566,6.5072,3.2843,0.2756,0.6286,5.0257,3.8078,1.7457,2.5425,4.478,0.374,0.9519,0.0001,4.259,2.9598,3.6206,3.8141,2.4719,1.5719,6.4819,2.3596,0.1262,2.7248,0.0928,0.6226,1.1304,0.6786,2.9199,0.0772,5.7792,1.2395,1.923,0.1687,0.0333,3.6095,0.5599,4.9247,1.8217,4.634,1.0416,5.0184,1.8623,4.3343,1.17,8.1503,2.8802,5.8798,3.4928,5.5249,4.3907,2.695,0.1677]}

The widening project was completed in December 1969, one year ahead of schedule.  With the new Turnpike widening, the Delaware Turnpike will expand, including a new intersection, a new exit, two new off-ramp ramps, and a new westbound lane.\n\nIn early 1970, an employee at the Delaware Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed a design change, allowing the Delaware Turnpike to become a new eastbound lane and a new westbound and southbound lane.  The design change was approved by voters in the November 1968 municipal election.\n\nIn 1973, the Delaware Turnpike Association (DLAA) formed an Independent Board to implement a revised design for the Delaware Turnpike project.  The new design was approved in 1985, but a request from the United States National Highway System (NHS) was rejected due to the lack of public feedback.  The New Jersey Turnpike System (NVS) also rejected the design change and was given a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nDelaware Turnpike Project  (pdf)","token_len":252,"entropy":[8.2994,7.0301,0.1701,10.3316,1.3039,2.3874,7.8233,1.1989,10.0266,5.983,0.0134,0.0013,3.3969,5.1036,2.4547,1.4082,0.826,2.8115,7.771,6.4097,0.4947,4.296,0.6141,1.7397,4.717,3.0525,1.2353,1.6429,0.4449,3.1423,1.2991,1.6137,6.001,0.5307,3.8199,0.0018,0.0432,0.4113,10.2756,11.616,1.1722,3.4256,5.3383,0.0014,0.0054,2.5416,1.9522,1.3214,1.5705,0.1213,0.0097,0.0047,2.4937,5.9869,5.567,5.2431,2.4802,1.4646,3.9579,2.3003,2.0852,0.955,4.7626,2.1264,3.7512,1.122,6.4538,0.4537,0.5755,2.364,1.9314,0.5263,0.7931,1.0426,0.4849,6.3332,0.3849,1.7305,0.9294,1.9591,0.0052,2.9217,4.2859,2.5351,0.1982,4.3969,6.2571,2.1022,0.9384,1.6355,2.9955,0.0044,0.1592,1.849,0.4676,0.0809,0.044,3.9619,1.6639,3.9376,3.2304,3.2518,4.5988,1.0555,2.0274,0.0674,0.0018,0.0018,0.2431,3.7084,0.7975,3.2266,4.8649,0.0783,1.692,3.1538,1.8422,0.1262,0.892,0.0022,7.8326,2.0832,0.002,0.3618,0.4886,3.558,1.583,2.9021,1.8298,0.729,1.2548,0.4745,6.1833,0.4192,3.266,1.7276,2.0972,4.2979,0.4801,0.5094,1.6898,0.0002,1.5961,3.6757,0.0659,1.0231,1.1408,0.3583,0.0008,0.0028,6.8501,1.1372,3.7646,3.9629,0.0894,3.4298,3.1431,6.682,2.9777,1.4841,5.1487,2.7804,4.4889,1.2246,1.7017,0.1685,0.8019,0.0241,0.0013,0.0013,5.5298,0.3007,0.8141,0.9236,2.9673,0.8167,1.9147,1.4494,1.8944,5.8273,2.1623,2.9182,3.3936,6.3607,2.3217,0.7051,7.5223,0.4133,4.688,1.2595,6.0571,0.6378,3.3975,1.0487,0.0333,2.122,3.365,2.7708,0.003,1.6022,2.7405,0.0006,3.2201,3.7822,0.4788,0.7079,1.1821,5.1769,0.4433,0.305,0.0017,0.003,6.787,1.1049,1.3284,4.4303,0.0678,3.3061,2.7985,0.2829,1.3595,0.7613,3.0501,2.6901,5.2524,1.3271,5.6266,0.2102,3.7865,0.1963,0.2383,0.8862,1.1103,0.0002,8.7406,0.9796,0.0005,6.8841,1.3977,0.7838,0.0003,4.6676,0.0043,0.5961,0.0014,0.0026,4.1254,7.8347,4.4942,3.5847,0.5845]}

The Hillingdon House was built of oak, a woody material not often found in the rest of England, and was later used for the accommodation provided by the RAF during the Second World War.  It stood along the south of the hill for most of its life as a camp house for soldiers who were trained to fly into the fields.

The seat was taken by James P. McCarty, a Republican governor who also held office for three years. One year after becoming Indiana governor, George Howard Johnson became governor and was a Republican. His successor, Governor John L. Breslin, was elected on February 12, 1853, becoming the first Republican Governor to resign after 30 years in office.\n\nIn January 1852, Jennings announced his bid for governor against Franklin J. Stetson in the Democratic primary. Jennings beat the opponent by an overwhelming margin. On February 5, 1860, Jennings was elected as an absentee judge of the Indiana State Court.

{"id":887,"ended":true,"length":246,"text":"The remaster offers several improvements over the original Perfect Dark that was released for the Nintendo 64 in 2000. The most remarkable change is that any of the multiplayer modes, including co @s_loud_sound mode, have gotten a massive overhaul thanks to the \"new, improved\" Wii U Controller, while the third option offers an integrated controller-like virtual controller.\n\nIn \"A New Way To Play\" for Wii U, the controller features the Nintendo Wii's special \"virtual\" analog stick system that can communicate with the virtual controller and make sense out of the game's controller if the input is not in play mode. That means you won't only be able to control online multiplayer matches if you're on Wii U, but you'll also be able to play offline games as well. With all those new features, it's one of the few Wii U games to truly deliver the full experience you want to experience on the Wii U.\n\nPlayStation 4 Controller for the 2DS and 3DS will ship with the remaster on March 3, but no word on when the Wii U will release. Right now, the console has a release date of March 8 for the 3DS, but it will be available to pre-order later, so keep your eyes peeled for updates on when you'll get them.","token_len":266,"entropy":[10.2423,3.6355,7.2598,5.2259,2.9656,0.989,0.4722,0.9624,11.8156,1.6453,4.9913,4.335,0.9699,2.9371,1.3105,4.0638,1.751,1.5702,3.7702,0.4131,1.5102,3.7125,7.2227,2.1497,0.3688,0.8545,6.9828,3.8867,0.1854,7.117,1.2458,2.8317,2.2796,4.5005,16.4374,4.1387,6.7368,4.7946,5.0316,2.1818,6.0936,5.2272,0.4178,2.3664,7.3647,1.5364,5.0115,0.9045,5.287,0.0461,1.0005,5.6782,3.6548,4.7871,2.7628,1.654,6.2939,0.44,3.7529,2.5503,5.04,0.8351,5.7959,5.6547,5.2037,3.1459,5.485,2.5637,4.7459,3.3479,7.4808,2.5669,1.7197,1.0685,0.002,3.1866,6.6654,4.4869,2.3609,3.5534,3.3524,0.3949,2.053,3.8082,2.0511,0.0687,0.4601,1.9378,4.0976,3.7415,2.7576,3.7223,3.1394,3.8789,5.7288,2.198,6.3745,2.0654,5.7991,0.685,5.5114,2.2548,2.82,6.9008,0.288,1.0705,4.6857,0.9214,2.8786,4.8055,4.6311,5.3262,0.0178,1.0271,2.65,1.0976,4.1093,7.8466,1.6895,5.5422,0.7836,2.6014,3.6678,4.4597,4.4174,0.1869,4.9253,2.053,1.8486,3.3566,0.0006,5.9384,1.0875,0.102,0.0035,3.2901,6.5512,1.2878,4.3266,5.6207,0.3288,1.8697,2.8684,3.1334,0.0391,0.4467,0.3362,0.6189,1.0156,0.4218,0.2345,0.0147,0.0096,1.3311,2.6474,3.4714,2.9328,0.1001,0.48,4.8809,4.1426,3.6423,2.2317,0.993,0.5834,2.0595,0.6652,5.1735,0.4432,0.1926,2.6332,2.9265,0.13,0.9265,2.3241,4.1254,4.044,1.9605,3.2276,2.4268,3.0585,2.2903,4.0348,1.702,1.7499,1.0625,1.9487,0.1213,0.4308,0.2947,0.0001,5.847,0.8579,0.8707,3.936,4.7656,2.6675,7.0924,0.8564,3.014,1.1118,0.0044,4.5198,3.777,1.4609,1.0863,1.7745,0.1527,1.6186,2.3152,3.4726,1.2094,2.9856,5.7979,2.693,0.7663,1.0276,1.7126,3.5503,0.0103,1.6648,3.3771,2.4471,7.3772,0.0129,0.2056,1.4061,3.3428,2.5744,1.6186,5.4354,0.7184,0.3971,0.7726,3.8424,4.0181,0.5201,2.7403,0.0122,1.219,1.333,2.242,2.0022,1.0873,1.3877,2.5447,1.0609,0.2948,0.0116,2.8071,4.9024,2.5979,3.3063,2.7548,0.2618,0.213,0.7935,3.7184,1.901,4.7485,3.6229,1.9993,1.1216,4.1853,0.2086]}

The pilot was reworked to revolve around an SNL style series, and Fey, who had previously worked on an NBC production company called Fey Studios, said, \"That might have sounded good, but a two year pilot of a comedy series, with a very well planned script, really gets people involved in creative stuff.\" Fey, who said he was not sure the studio had seen the original, put it down to the \"entire set of sitcoms... and the fact that they never picked it up, really just seemed like a great idea.\" Fey also claimed he was unaware of Fey working directly on the show himself.\n\nThe show won a Tony Award for Best Comedy. Fey later asked to have the TV production halted in his honor and to be replaced by an independent producer, but a request from NBC for \"several more episodes\" was rejected.

The chapel was consecrated in 1741; it has remained a historic building ever since.\n\nSee also\n List of medieval choristers\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n John Smith (editors), \"Historical Archaeology of the Holy Cross, 1732-1770: A detailed account of the Gothic interior of the Holy Cross Cathedral\", London, 1887.\n\nExternal links\nJohn Smith Library in Waverley\nArchaeology of the Holy Cross Cathedral\n\nGallery of the Holy Cross Cathedral, Waverley","token_len":271,"entropy":[8.1679,2.6676,9.1715,5.4144,11.1691,6.005,1.1952,5.8676,0.3763,1.0086,1.3706,8.526,0.363,1.7553,4.6837,0.6763,5.038,2.6761,0.495,6.126,0.7127,0.6397,7.2632,9.2887,0.3833,7.071,8.1953,1.9042,4.4985,5.3038,2.8763,0.809,2.8181,1.4793,8.4281,1.4498,1.9833,4.8076,4.4986,5.6323,2.2137,4.4982,0.0265,0.5091,2.3034,0.7695,0.8019,0.7958,2.8439,0.9578,5.5175,2.8409,5.2753,1.4056,0.5808,0.1594,5.3433,3.1586,1.0701,2.1514,2.8059,4.4732,3.9147,0.49,2.8295,6.291,4.0608,0.0401,2.6068,2.1549,2.8789,1.4039,4.2283,2.9587,3.3413,1.786,3.8161,0.0668,3.9242,0.5158,3.8864,4.5755,4.6719,6.5008,0.4495,3.5463,4.1989,0.4405,3.4746,2.3746,3.9512,0.2925,0.164,2.4167,1.048,1.8954,3.2104,0.1302,3.7717,3.4484,2.7573,1.1156,2.9079,1.008,3.7326,2.314,2.1594,3.681,2.7655,4.2373,1.9471,1.6071,4.6852,2.0251,5.3334,1.9998,0.6008,3.3355,3.3491,0.1389,4.5827,3.0296,1.3536,1.0424,6.1779,4.1084,2.8291,1.6934,0.0697,4.9618,0.0083,1.4992,4.8305,1.3236,2.0839,3.8158,1.0014,1.1661,2.0594,1.1786,5.9929,2.3928,7.1423,3.7315,2.8001,1.7179,3.4127,5.0056,1.3358,3.832,2.5352,2.8481,4.3319,4.7704,0.3458,2.367,1.155,2.5984,2.532,3.9696,1.448,2.4345,0.9148,6.3285,0.0025,1.37,0.845,3.7749,5.32,1.583,2.7813,3.3907,2.9647,7.5988,2.4093,2.662,0.0026,0.3521,1.5943,0.0002,5.2919,0.7309,1.57,23.312,0.0692,6.3949,7.1227,0.9829,1.9344,1.744,0.0002,2.3898,1.2471,0.0004,2.9402,2.8572,5.2719,20.4188,5.3684,3.0114,1.9452,4.3941,1.9747,2.9788,3.7927,0.6211,4.4426,0.0859,0.5063,1.2939,5.0113,3.2201,2.3672,2.7142,3.5515,0.4094,0.3328,4.9854,3.0389,1.542,7.9639,1.6368,0.183,0.4608,6.1592,6.3623,1.6083,1.6229,2.7593,0.2756,3.4985,1.4832,3.345,1.7978,3.1054,4.3892,0.9371,0.9244,0.0003,6.7048,0.5609,1.1638,22.5586,0.4566,5.3366,5.5649,4.8694,0.1987,0.0124,2.6627,23.9437,0.4612,1.1617,1.3389,0.4526,0.314,0.0036,1.6002,2.0125,0.0003,6.1575,1.2106,1.4171,1.5661,0.0139,0.5225,2.9879,2.4657,0.008,0.0042]}

Today, the Republic of Croatia is one party in the Socialist Revolutionary Union.\n\nIn 1991, the Government of the Republic of Yugoslavia started supporting the Socialist Republic of Croatia because the country was one of the countries where the Socialist Party of Croatia was formed. This support became popular because by 1992, every member of the socialist society accepted the Socialist Republic as a Communist Party.\n\nIn 1993, after the establishment of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, it was established as a Communist party to form to form a party for the reformist movement.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to form communist party led to the downfall of the Nationalist Party, the Nationalist Party in the 1992 legislative elections had to withdraw in favor of unity. The Socialist Party of Croatia chose not to form a party for the reformist movement because of the growing nationalist sentiments.\n\nReferences\n\nLiterature\n\nBibliography\n OJI  (1991), the National Socialist History of Yugoslavia.\n\nExternal links\n\n \"The Official Website\n \"The Official Socialist Website\"","token_len":273,"entropy":[10.0717,0.2436,1.9314,4.4328,2.1531,2.3796,6.93,0.8253,0.0243,5.8067,4.2693,0.3013,10.0995,4.6239,2.9241,2.7772,7.4525,0.0037,5.6936,4.2027,2.8398,4.7201,3.0904,6.3796,3.5962,0.8028,4.3819,2.3691,0.8919,1.6788,4.2536,3.9826,0.5172,5.0818,1.054,0.9137,3.9488,6.4641,7.6514,4.7523,1.3023,1.0051,2.4584,0.5886,0.2747,0.6906,1.6521,3.0163,3.0505,1.9073,4.2497,1.3274,4.4212,4.0985,0.1827,1.1117,0.5511,2.6664,2.065,4.6231,1.9514,2.0166,4.8397,0.3409,0.7064,5.2108,0.1875,0.2532,0.8523,2.2395,9.1704,1.9987,0.8622,2.1823,7.4192,3.548,2.0688,0.7548,0.0027,2.4538,3.0033,0.1795,0.5731,4.1422,0.1012,0.6115,1.4319,0.0082,3.1918,4.8151,6.2285,1.246,2.1946,3.6934,0.0354,0.1785,4.7378,2.2575,3.2491,0.9322,4.2475,0.0607,0.1738,3.83,2.6916,0.9807,2.5051,0.8263,0.2656,0.2926,1.0007,2.3079,0.2871,3.2147,3.9489,4.538,5.5753,2.4044,6.8569,2.2218,0.3283,6.7256,1.9522,0.0917,0.13,4.273,4.2154,6.3187,0.8775,1.4541,3.1737,6.1463,1.1129,5.611,1.0508,0.7524,1.4034,0.0002,1.2806,1.8969,0.0813,3.8946,0.8473,4.6775,0.0123,0.1994,0.7641,0.9807,0.0558,0.2232,0.3659,3.4978,1.0303,2.6747,1.1499,0.5894,1.6281,3.3184,3.7461,5.9384,6.5496,2.3029,0.9678,4.0371,2.364,0.6092,6.7153,1.7826,2.8784,1.1545,1.7054,0.0002,3.8092,3.9902,6.274,0.9032,0.6528,1.3667,5.7532,1.4344,5.4185,2.097,0.5107,4.7472,0.0265,0.2221,5.5206,2.0204,1.004,1.9729,0.5816,3.4332,0.3458,0.2735,4.0101,1.3615,6.9175,7.9439,0.1791,4.5688,0.995,3.8759,4.761,3.2124,0.0035,7.9201,1.7762,1.5724,3.7215,0.4268,0.5407,0.0996,6.2414,2.9127,0.0061,1.8806,0.5189,1.4745,1.8003,0.595,1.0922,0.0497,0.1001,2.5226,1.2974,0.7885,5.0378,6.2334,3.1084,2.2433,0.8837,0.0002,7.8356,1.1546,0.0003,10.4971,0.1353,0.5733,0.0002,2.9711,3.1926,0.404,17.8499,4.606,4.663,8.457,10.3737,2.7418,2.1117,5.8856,4.6986,1.9509,7.0047,0.5098,1.957,1.6404,2.0553,0.0002,7.585,0.3972,4.1963,11.7973,2.1471,6.7243,4.8998,6.4481,11.25,2.3999,1.6447,4.8923,3.6579,1.6588]}

Of house fires that result in death, smoking causes 25 % and heating devices cause 22 %. Fire safety is the main factor that contributes to fires. Also, smoking can cause physical, emotional and mental destruction of victims of disasters.\n\nCigarette-related injuries are common in both communities of North Dakota and Northern Minnesota. Fire incidents related to cigarettes are the third most common cause of death in North Dakota. A second problem that can be exacerbated by this problem is alcohol.

Alcohol is a leading public health and social alcohol-related health risk factor. And drinking in North Dakota also decreases overall health and wellbeing among non-natives.\n\nTo manage this public health issue, the state is working closely with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to establish a statewide campaign to stop the spread or prevention of alcohol-related injuries. The awareness campaign will begin in January and will continue through July 1, 2020.\n\nTo learn more about this public health resource, check out our FAQs.","token_len":274,"entropy":[2.6222,4.9429,0.0679,0.2762,8.9116,3.1803,9.4115,7.017,1.0786,2.979,1.3365,0.5429,4.3361,0.0706,4.2739,1.3317,6.1377,12.3808,0.8287,3.0758,3.9359,0.5203,2.358,0.7566,8.8672,3.7055,4.9229,6.8622,2.7821,4.7566,7.0493,1.5748,4.0032,0.218,0.9748,3.4076,4.3501,1.6775,1.6573,3.2907,2.7287,2.4415,2.4773,0.0653,5.1323,0.7595,6.2753,0.3327,4.5953,2.8074,1.3261,5.4856,3.6042,1.3986,0.8306,1.7543,7.1325,3.2831,4.2042,3.9448,5.8696,0.626,1.2367,0.001,4.5662,3.229,0.2624,5.0836,0.8458,1.6333,1.2723,3.7258,1.1816,4.6334,6.8718,3.9766,6.5354,2.893,1.4759,7.3268,3.1772,0.3768,3.4092,4.6508,4.6858,0.0058,2.1576,1.2535,3.4838,3.3294,1.2268,0.1761,0.7811,0.0836,1.2104,0.7184,1.5133,0.0124,1.4547,3.9507,5.1863,6.1472,3.442,2.8891,1.3066,4.0908,0.3107,5.1271,2.8336,0.1675,4.8159,1.5174,2.4946,3.2217,2.6291,2.8745,5.8899,1.7501,3.6269,3.0102,3.4017,1.3889,2.5664,6.1095,1.2769,1.2586,0.0002,4.4959,0.0056,0.618,2.7794,0.0081,0.0007,0.0004,0.261,0.0002,0.3867,2.2064,4.9169,0.0315,2.2543,0.518,0.0228,2.6772,1.3383,4.7377,0.0109,1.0788,1.5299,3.3176,0.5939,7.218,2.567,2.1253,5.9013,0.0392,3.0054,1.5255,6.8828,0.0092,5.5481,4.8088,0.6044,5.0981,0.0208,2.2724,1.9196,0.3144,3.2619,2.1912,1.7252,3.1416,7.2982,0.0088,4.6844,2.8377,8.6658,2.1951,0.1182,2.0162,1.3787,0.4347,0.838,6.8512,5.1057,3.4383,1.5282,0.0029,4.3932,4.9884,4.7677,2.0286,1.5939,4.4764,3.1851,5.4124,0.1633,3.8705,0.5683,0.6475,0.4676,0.0003,5.3087,6.063,3.2645,4.202,0.026,2.2237,0.168,1.5893,2.0198,2.6507,2.1619,3.3775,0.0152,2.4181,2.6973,0.1213,0.2654,0.5099,2.4383,0.008,0.7133,0.6674,4.5035,1.5668,3.189,5.3855,0.6702,4.4317,1.705,2.0543,7.8389,3.9919,0.0116,1.4538,0.5415,0.0311,0.8291,0.6991,2.0634,7.3813,1.3396,1.3622,2.851,0.8314,2.6366,1.7701,0.9584,1.3577,0.8601,3.6469,3.7728,0.741,2.4482,0.2136,0.6201,0.0002,3.7998,0.6508,0.0603,0.1531,2.4072,4.3293,0.0307,8.0646,0.4423,5.2112,0.1008,2.2339,4.9118,1.6536,1.3032]}

The work is well known in Chicago and beyond, particularly in the neighborhood of Bury St. Mary's.\n\nDu Bois is currently living in Dallas.","token_len":275,"entropy":[8.8375,2.209,12.3306,8.5444,8.3968,13.0424,9.038,5.2777,7.7794,10.8896,6.6463,2.7037,3.0724,3.882,1.5421,2.3272,5.3739,3.5541,6.6582,0.8165,5.6499,1.199,0.6534,2.5807,12.1498,1.1365,1.9766,3.5604,0.456,0.5597,2.8113,7.1557,10.2641,7.8733,5.4997,4.3807,4.6412,4.3606,3.5551,3.389,1.6507,2.9867,0.6025,0.2693,2.0121,3.7208,1.7057,1.6612,3.5219,5.5545,1.4933,2.7151,4.4683,3.2302,6.3052,0.1502,2.7757,5.3763,0.6129,6.6495,5.8677,2.6784,6.7155,3.4377,3.8685,0.0486,3.9279,1.1919,1.9324,1.3877,0.3204,4.09,1.0163,1.336,5.3684,1.9768,0.7911,4.5371,4.4256,3.4975,5.8032,1.3705,6.0448,4.6508,5.9655,2.1418,1.8219,0.0046,0.6471,5.1821,1.8579,3.9761,1.4892,2.9997,4.768,2.0594,2.0547,1.9619,2.3008,0.0368,0.5016,0.2401,0.0004,1.8391,1.6781,4.809,0.0185,3.9065,0.0046,0.2185,5.4014,0.5688,3.6826,0.0894,4.0679,6.3728,5.8999,0.65,5.3442,2.0151,3.3187,4.862,2.1158,6.2181,1.9831,1.3346,1.545,1.5,1.8707,5.7542,5.3463,4.0069,2.2943,0.4231,4.1093,3.8047,5.2939,0.454,0.8489,1.1617,0.3596,3.2641,0.6612,1.464,0.043,2.6738,2.7795,0.0089,5.5652,3.6193,0.1366,0.0838,0.0104,0.8827,0.5799,7.0588,0.0153,0.0011,2.0467,4.8416,4.4376,1.4196,0.015,4.9252,0.0445,2.415,1.183,1.0585,3.0711,6.1279,3.8455,0.9154,0.0267,1.0838,3.0139,2.5875,0.5615,0.326,6.0886,3.2779,1.2966,5.7215,5.1367,6.5357,2.422,7.1387,2.6588,4.7165,0.7121,3.1594,5.3624,0.6432,0.43,1.4489,2.0049,0.042,0.3425,3.8082,0.992,2.6404,0.0003,3.4532,4.287,5.0588,4.1217,3.0398,3.6703,1.3075,4.924,0.8784,5.4941,0.6757,2.3659,1.6755,0.0125,0.5997,0.6045,2.2258,2.5269,0.3378,1.8217,2.1029,0.5199,2.1546,0.0002,2.696,6.956,2.7332,3.1724,1.2457,2.2881,3.3307,1.2166,3.6394,2.3765,0.2324,2.2907,3.5671,3.4042,4.9444,1.9291,1.8784,3.2337,1.7851,5.7666,0.6969,1.9972,1.3003,1.8085,4.9109,1.8994,4.1775,1.6465,0.82,4.7433,0.813,5.3394,6.1172,1.3867,0.6106,3.2008,1.1352,1.14,0.8794,0.0002,1.8825,0.0258,0.0005,3.0621,4.5567,3.379,0.3457,6.3401,1.9218]}

It is a great place to enjoy good food and to snargle your way through the sea, enjoying the beach and even the sun.","token_len":277,"entropy":[8.3598,9.8407,9.043,4.8225,6.9565,11.4543,8.6654,11.2878,3.6572,2.2565,2.2089,5.2423,1.1687,5.7239,7.2021,1.9985,12.7046,6.5211,8.7293,10.4082,2.9245,2.6542,6.7098,6.2729,5.4841,0.4118,2.577,3.0817,1.2656,4.2307,8.5964,4.6838,0.5155,1.3803,1.2639,0.416,9.4175,7.1843,5.0843,6.1768,3.7404,4.4553,14.1075,5.898,1.7681,3.8154,0.0234,5.1006,1.8468,1.8873,5.1151,5.891,5.0564,4.0726,5.1129,3.1786,1.346,3.52,0.0137,1.5976,3.142,3.9567,3.5503,7.5416,0.9459,5.2034,0.9734,1.6597,0.1489,3.4197,2.5695,3.2443,4.903,0.7554,3.4916,4.9894,1.4546,1.1851,0.2532,4.3123,4.3339,6.9087,2.8018,0.0186,2.4218,2.5792,4.101,3.7554,0.8977,0.6088,6.2498,5.1317,6.5017,6.0777,4.7142,2.0781,4.1267,2.5247,5.6939,4.8392,4.1454,1.3197,1.0567,3.0708,0.496,4.1968,1.0845,3.0979,3.5526,0.8571,4.9145,1.1008,1.1342,0.0003,4.1362,1.4113,2.5504,0.2164,2.0316,2.932,1.1549,3.9533,2.1484,5.4949,3.7333,7.7862,0.0426,0.3996,0.0043,5.9179,1.982,4.527,3.0805,4.1063,7.8489,2.0188,2.8018,2.8887,1.4424,0.6576,3.7267,3.798,0.6349,0.9049,5.123,1.6864,6.1966,1.285,6.484,5.8545,1.9328,4.7595,4.0436,6.5973,5.1364,0.03,6.035,5.1028,1.3664,3.1515,3.2714,5.3724,6.7026,3.3374,0.2032,1.043,0.922,0.9211,0.0003,3.7581,2.3763,3.9623,0.9645,2.3229,3.9297,4.4352,3.2664,5.3836,2.4814,3.9547,3.6627,2.9114,0.0413,0.0003,0.472,0.6697,4.6284,3.1866,4.4534,6.3263,3.0601,5.7669,2.9505,6.8096,4.8636,3.6935,5.8047,0.8338,7.0434,0.2712,0.4478,0.2477,1.3279,2.3465,3.2874,0.8797,1.4348,5.5787,1.6218,1.0406,4.7147,1.1535,2.1889,3.6519,2.5212,1.5335,3.5477,3.749,1.8041,1.1113,0.7373,0.7467,2.0437,2.4663,1.4645,0.7892,0.6931,0.0002,3.9093,0.26,0.08,0.0521,1.1187,2.2141,1.4258,1.1259,1.9415,0.7893,6.3559,5.6831,3.7188,4.0947,5.359,4.1979,8.5694,3.0805,6.0111,0.6467,2.5382,1.0568,1.7978,1.7385,0.6599,0.3548,4.1438,4.5809,2.664,0.9525,3.467,5.9038,11.5611,0.0382,5.2144,1.3377,1.2659,0.5624,5.7768,3.1873,4.8386,1.1148,4.1217,2.0028,5.3168,2.7998,3.6184,0.8138]}

The small minority of Orthodox Jews found this change to be intolerable, and they began to hold their services separately, in the center on the small stage, where they were placed a few minutes before the first sermon.

And after a few months, everything, nothing, it is finally settled.\n\nIt is also my opinion that the old congregation was very weak and not worthy of the high place.

I do not have much to say to this, but what I would like to think is that it might be possible to live here with a sense of pride.\n\nI also want to say that many of the people who came here to enjoy this service were Orthodox Christians, which may have been more than one. They also came here to find that the old synagogue was a place where the people lived and were well acquainted with each other and to be well respected.

{"id":2432,"ended":true,"length":266,"text":"While the electric guitar was originally designed to be simply amplified in order to reproduce its sound at a higher volume, guitarists quickly discovered the creative possibilities of using the amplifier to modify the performance of a single guitar, as long as they were tuned to a specific musical range, regardless of what they were playing, and while using two different frequencies of the same chord, the technique was only used \"to amplify any one song on any single track\". Because the guitar was tuned not to play the guitar directly, it was then likely that there would be very few differences between these two sounds and would be easier to use.\n\nIt was only in 1989 that the guitar was put on sale again for $150. One of the first examples of that was The Bitch Who Cried a Long Way as its signature line to this day. The first one was released on February 12, 1989. It was followed with the second one in 1991.\n\nAccording to the Guitar World Magazine, \"this is the last time we will ever have this awesome vintage instrument.

But now, they have had an unexpected victory; the lost American sailors have lost the battle to liberate their comrades who escaped. A new type of battle has been launched against the Americans and has resulted in the US Navy losing almost 5,000 sailors due to the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nSo who was the man who got this team that stormed the Port St. Louis and took control of the ship to liberate those American sailors? The Captain of the USS Liberty was the man who was responsible for starting the USS Liberty during the attack on Pearl Harbor that also brought back the entire American fleet. He is also credited with leading the crew into the attack that was conducted on all ships. That\u2019s right there is a connection between the Admiral and his crew who were responsible or had helped in setting the siege that occurred to the Liberty.

{"id":2523,"ended":true,"length":243,"text":"Compared to its closest wild cousins ( the coyote and golden jackal ), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer fur. Compared to the yellow-black wolf, the wolf has a stronger sense of smell, and has a faster attack, while the coyote lacks an intelligence in its attacks, and has weaker instincts.\n\nThe coyote (Sudgwood) is widely regarded as a predator, and the yellow-black wolf, one of the best known breeds, is considered a very dangerous animal and has suffered extreme attacks and threats due to its aggressive behavior.\n\nSome studies suggest that the coyote possesses similar characteristics to the wolf. The coyote\u2019s coat has a deep greyish color, as well as a deep fur coat. The coyote\u2019s fur is similar to that of the adult Wolf, a typical wolf jacket.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Marine Mammal Data Center, the number of wild species of coyotes in the U.S. increased from 43 to 95 in 1996, which was a 5-fold increase over the same period in 1996. The wolf, like all carnivores in the United States, is the most vulnerable wild animal in the U.S., and is estimated to be about 9 million to 13 million miles away from humans.","token_len":279,"entropy":[2.1423,4.1958,5.9269,10.401,2.5011,3.6537,8.6776,6.0531,0.6815,1.0529,7.5881,5.397,1.0379,0.7728,0.7258,6.4781,0.3424,1.4209,6.5415,1.2281,3.3706,2.341,1.896,1.0463,6.2977,4.1875,0.0075,1.5197,4.4062,3.0827,0.4811,2.9027,3.4908,4.6765,1.1206,2.7751,6.0164,0.7997,5.855,0.169,1.7356,5.9624,2.4309,4.6461,0.4675,0.6007,0.658,2.7428,1.1758,1.0395,5.8066,5.3593,0.0367,0.0456,1.043,1.6786,2.5386,1.2199,5.6388,6.7731,3.764,4.4421,0.6387,2.8496,0.0067,4.5527,4.1951,4.6594,4.3152,2.3683,4.7675,2.1307,1.473,1.8375,4.7489,3.1883,0.7245,1.3766,0.006,1.4783,3.0953,0.0239,4.2925,5.8124,5.6226,5.0135,6.9694,3.782,0.9919,5.9202,3.2993,0.0672,1.7842,3.3936,1.6617,1.56,2.7338,3.5845,0.1872,0.0911,0.0583,2.9567,5.9887,0.0235,0.1823,3.6529,0.2538,5.5071,1.7323,0.6637,1.5509,1.286,3.7824,3.0651,2.3249,4.8163,2.7391,5.1455,5.5561,2.7136,2.9849,6.5205,4.1822,0.0084,0.3829,3.8468,1.169,0.2389,1.5459,0.0002,5.6094,4.4117,2.2485,0.2212,0.8817,1.3553,0.0119,5.2437,6.4174,2.0429,0.4104,0.8821,2.022,1.7358,2.0523,2.3348,0.0138,13.4315,8.1615,1.9387,4.4145,2.6434,1.3871,4.9027,4.8269,3.3852,2.0911,1.4542,4.2328,1.1075,0.0026,1.2099,3.5777,3.5994,2.3305,1.3085,1.176,2.4972,0.0098,1.6668,0.072,0.0429,2.9662,1.1022,4.4926,0.2979,0.5703,0.0707,0.4064,5.9818,6.4141,1.3241,4.8543,6.1327,2.9141,6.9829,1.408,1.4917,0.0002,5.0936,0.004,1.2207,3.2464,0.0303,0.0461,0.0168,5.1509,0.0697,0.0103,5.1192,0.8002,0.519,0.8947,5.3295,0.0277,4.1315,5.3485,1.5416,0.9151,0.2647,1.5517,0.5214,1.3406,0.0006,0.0014,0.118,3.1668,0.9361,5.8763,2.2081,5.2731,0.5374,4.5543,1.1062,3.1929,1.8605,2.1293,4.1168,2.476,0.8084,0.093,2.0691,0.8758,1.4777,0.2608,0.7838,2.5166,0.3323,1.5628,3.923,2.4667,4.9582,1.4022,5.1741,0.0969,4.6166,0.8741,3.3874,0.0058,0.0901,1.3234,4.3809,1.5385,5.3787,6.4036,0.827,1.2635,0.4313,2.133,0.0004,0.0019,0.455,1.3081,2.2087,4.1314,0.0588,1.2427,3.576,4.753,3.1243,3.2666,2.4617,0.0338,4.3102,0.675,0.4593,1.4201,0.4084]}

{"id":382,"ended":true,"length":263,"text":"The play repeatedly mocks Victorian traditions and social customs, marriage and the pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over @ - @ riding societal value, and not the social value of self. So, in a much less serious sense, the play has no point, no good meaning, and no moral foundation in actual fact, so it is an exercise of moral imagination, a cynical self-deprecation, a self-fulfilling prophecy. And because the play, if it did nothing but appeal to this naive sense of how social and traditional life are, and how much of Victorian society is one of greed, hypocrisy, hypocrisy, and self-importance. To the extent that this play is simply about the social and cultural values of Victorian society as a whole, not as people, its depiction is ill-considered, a betrayal of Victorian notions of moral legitimacy. Of course, the play itself has more than its fair share of faults, too, and that is why it takes this moral drama serious. The play is more than just a fun diversion for the occasional spectator that should have a long walk through the suburbs, or a quiet place to have a laugh and relax. It is a long and entertaining, but entertaining, and very sad and disturbing play where everything is too short, and the action is as long as the action takes.","token_len":279,"entropy":[8.0799,9.8246,7.2874,0.1241,10.6113,6.3426,1.9032,5.6961,4.3273,1.0783,11.3323,1.1364,2.7314,5.5675,0.0104,4.3568,3.8496,4.783,0.4587,3.2458,5.7848,2.0825,14.1472,3.252,1.3946,2.8463,2.2682,0.1619,1.7599,9.3236,14.8662,6.9784,4.9686,12.4053,11.1798,4.1692,2.1906,1.5557,4.8787,1.4849,4.5263,1.6799,0.7349,5.316,1.5575,4.6513,2.2317,2.3922,2.4496,6.0831,2.9896,4.9445,2.3872,0.2585,2.0441,1.0448,3.9016,4.3025,6.4402,2.7778,3.8437,6.7864,4.408,0.8392,0.7585,1.2675,4.4209,4.1572,3.2298,6.337,3.1479,2.4316,3.5331,1.5619,1.5197,3.8926,4.1059,2.7597,4.8053,3.8545,2.2797,3.1521,6.8214,5.6827,0.1488,4.4079,0.0121,0.2269,1.3855,1.5726,3.6691,0.0659,3.2886,0.0124,0.0001,0.0552,0.8174,4.1926,4.8689,2.1859,0.9177,4.428,4.5863,0.9881,5.1056,7.364,1.9686,5.5841,0.0632,4.319,5.6994,4.642,0.0329,5.6605,3.6628,3.6213,6.2121,3.1681,3.7353,2.1419,4.2756,1.5226,3.8348,2.0414,3.3582,1.2586,0.9423,6.0222,1.1525,6.5547,0.772,5.1328,0.4437,4.5768,0.5162,0.9663,2.43,0.0705,3.5939,0.001,5.5881,5.3519,2.9262,2.2213,0.3815,2.439,2.3558,1.3752,5.2051,3.598,1.7386,3.4912,2.4089,1.9924,2.0229,0.4851,1.0628,0.9964,4.3633,1.0219,0.0391,0.225,6.4484,4.3392,6.6717,1.0011,4.2597,5.7344,2.0201,5.5618,0.7145,2.5807,0.001,1.4698,4.8585,6.2098,0.1353,1.7276,4.8448,0.166,4.987,7.0901,0.8433,5.9745,0.1997,0.3911,1.8147,0.9466,3.5271,3.1265,4.9153,2.4349,1.3385,1.0327,0.0111,0.0129,2.8012,0.8332,4.1915,1.2344,2.2062,3.5994,1.2294,2.0245,1.0633,6.2109,4.1885,6.4162,6.1374,8.5013,0.7589,2.4258,0.8556,1.5389,5.2812,1.2797,1.5692,0.799,5.5178,2.9562,1.7332,1.3003,7.9424,6.2674,6.4118,6.1502,2.254,3.9559,5.5549,4.5748,1.7596,0.7146,6.5242,1.4051,2.3279,1.7517,6.0636,4.4536,1.0331,5.0471,0.5541,3.4574,3.4582,4.0244,1.0042,0.5292,0.5179,1.0394,6.5303,2.489,4.5577,3.2299,4.7106,6.3785,1.4124,1.9118,4.2942,3.9402,3.4023,3.4583,1.2097,6.0778,5.6492,1.2803,6.2969,5.7977,2.4151,1.6235,1.7999,6.287,1.0197,5.3561,3.8029,0.5653,1.6286,3.0199,2.2068,0.9534]}

It would have used the larger reentry module which was also proposed for the Big Gemini spacecraft, which have flown on the Moon successfully.\n\nIn addition a separate space observatory, the NASA Planck Planck, was proposed by two different people for Earth-like, near-realistic and similar instruments capable of being integrated on top of a spacecraft. The NASA program for such a mission would have been a collaboration with the Soviet space agency, the UK and the US. At the time, the USSR decided and approved of such an experiment. That means that the planck will be an optical-based instrument. To get this idea from the Soviets, there will be a series of probes in sequence as well as instruments to detect and identify atmospheric dust. The project would take place at a scale of less than 80 billion years.\n\nThe main mission of the Manned Orbital Telescope aims at the measurement of the rotation and rotation of the Earth through a series of telescopes, all of which are being used today for monitoring atmospheric dust that can be detected in any part of the world or in other places of the world. The launch of the spacecraft would take place in the second half of 2022.\n\nOn April 9, the International Space Station will return to Earth as part of the planned mission.","token_len":279,"entropy":[7.0068,6.6665,5.8588,9.088,3.928,3.3856,7.677,2.054,0.9972,4.0853,2.639,4.4009,5.6658,7.8328,3.9492,3.444,1.0752,1.8266,2.253,1.4831,3.8502,1.9818,6.6304,10.565,1.8174,5.0688,4.7578,1.873,4.3198,3.8902,1.8356,1.2341,7.0689,10.3707,3.5245,2.0183,1.8052,7.1758,4.7242,2.3854,1.4418,2.687,6.4487,0.5738,1.0156,0.0024,3.5455,2.8482,6.4491,5.3124,4.5366,3.8319,0.0023,2.146,1.1521,5.2781,6.6672,0.4409,5.2294,0.7384,3.496,1.3764,1.8121,2.1115,5.1135,3.6294,3.607,3.0417,5.7377,1.7829,2.735,5.3011,4.4363,0.2807,7.1779,2.0197,3.4874,6.265,4.4229,7.1191,0.0072,4.7327,5.764,4.2762,4.6163,0.0199,2.0776,2.4524,0.6405,1.5143,4.4972,5.9555,2.7575,3.4667,1.3749,2.012,1.6325,0.858,1.5747,3.4873,4.3247,2.3401,0.8321,5.4838,2.5367,0.1916,1.3064,1.3397,7.6408,2.643,0.9446,0.6016,0.6097,5.6828,0.5412,0.5174,1.5941,1.012,3.0226,6.1164,7.3584,3.7514,3.8422,4.4766,1.8924,2.9278,1.0182,5.8248,5.3349,0.7799,1.3399,4.1558,0.4855,3.891,0.8762,3.7115,4.7621,4.1919,2.206,1.4205,2.4051,6.1349,3.3985,3.1616,3.3952,4.6476,1.0351,3.3006,0.4605,3.9542,3.8086,0.3049,1.0778,4.7925,0.0025,6.345,3.4043,8.7091,4.9754,1.5682,0.3081,4.3474,1.8875,2.8658,2.24,4.4207,6.2765,5.0886,1.7965,1.8483,4.3832,1.7937,3.7351,1.2397,1.9041,1.9902,5.2156,0.8204,5.2319,0.0043,6.6209,5.0267,4.414,0.7185,0.4728,0.0003,1.3787,4.6225,3.7633,0.8683,0.3213,1.5336,0.0461,0.1043,0.0347,7.907,1.8006,2.9021,4.5052,0.1359,1.0748,6.2329,2.0512,2.9562,0.573,0.566,1.3648,5.5211,1.8117,2.8448,0.004,4.0307,2.3005,4.2664,1.044,0.1015,1.3117,4.4296,2.6363,4.2981,2.0256,5.2944,4.0049,1.8085,4.8475,2.6515,0.658,0.8021,2.2495,5.2685,2.3247,0.0044,0.1313,1.4828,5.5079,1.9082,3.7972,2.355,3.7972,0.8931,1.0612,0.1661,1.2279,6.9263,1.0579,0.3096,2.7781,2.2932,2.2537,0.0773,1.073,2.0647,4.0735,0.3486,0.0034,5.4942,0.6042,0.7916,0.0002,4.5294,3.642,3.3725,0.5757,2.0589,4.0561,0.4871,0.0267,1.7811,4.2175,0.4402,0.6196,3.5993,1.0425,0.0009,0.8706,5.0784,3.9695,0.7875]}

This was in time to allow the arrival of an army of the Spanish King Juan Carlos II in 1858. The army gave up all its territory and the capital, which was then occupied by the Italian colonial power, and settled in Spain. The country remained part of Italy and Spain until 1787 when it was annexed by the United Kingdom.\n\nAs a result of this annexation, all of the capital that had originally belonged to the Kingdom was transferred to the provinces. With all those territories annexed, the territory of Brazil has become a bit more isolated. As the Kingdom is now a province of Argentina, it is difficult to know where to go or where to stop. All that is required is to visit both the capital of the Kingdom and its neighbor, the province of South America.\n\nThis article aims to describe all the main cities or tourist attractions in the province, namely, Buenos Aires, Piedras de Alameda, San Juan, L\u00f3pezo de Rosario, Ponce, Santa Fe, and many others.","token_len":280,"entropy":[8.5492,0.6051,8.5756,0.0006,2.0012,5.9339,5.1902,1.2031,1.6988,7.0644,3.0572,11.5046,5.3598,1.4165,6.8173,6.1146,0.0852,2.9389,7.4047,2.7862,0.0003,1.5011,3.8327,1.4491,6.8833,0.003,0.4274,1.6398,3.9028,7.8125,9.6802,3.2987,1.1977,3.4435,2.2712,3.131,6.1495,0.3302,1.5337,6.4586,4.9455,2.765,1.9761,2.2365,0.1546,5.3487,3.5278,2.6483,6.3689,1.8755,0.0237,2.3716,5.3917,3.2143,0.0045,2.3237,2.1982,0.446,2.1121,4.4878,1.3093,1.1947,5.3048,1.2842,3.1245,3.3995,6.5902,4.8185,2.0206,4.11,1.4564,4.1283,1.4527,3.2957,7.658,1.561,5.515,2.0695,6.0019,0.0268,4.5868,2.9774,1.0991,3.9228,2.2294,6.3128,3.1544,0.8441,3.1257,2.6519,0.964,3.4632,0.4487,2.3739,2.9061,5.8268,3.5083,3.0889,2.927,3.1847,1.6899,3.4488,4.3139,1.828,4.4611,0.9244,3.038,3.443,0.0744,0.6166,5.8348,6.6919,3.3631,0.5628,3.625,3.9704,0.558,4.8131,0.5888,2.0968,4.7705,3.6077,3.9395,0.0207,4.5596,3.4879,3.3014,0.9979,3.9502,3.5254,1.6651,1.4614,0.3608,2.4114,0.6075,1.0006,1.7208,1.6668,0.8053,0.9325,0.0002,4.6363,1.5068,1.6539,0.4109,0.9459,4.0751,0.4852,4.8715,1.6753,0.9098,3.8489,5.5237,1.5272,5.2441,1.309,0.0052,0.7873,3.7084,1.919,2.5988,0.2097,0.591,7.0315,1.966,5.2375,3.9558,4.9473,2.6272,4.8068,0.4825,0.7662,3.2763,0.9264,6.2825,5.9065,2.6738,2.1039,5.683,1.3569,4.109,1.023,3.8645,2.6445,4.3563,3.1433,1.046,2.4301,3.1815,0.6881,2.8037,0.2806,1.9315,1.0472,3.6556,0.2566,3.5085,1.7449,0.7879,1.2688,4.1887,1.4143,0.1005,4.0106,0.3568,5.4827,2.1571,0.5416,5.3905,0.3617,1.0353,3.7395,6.115,1.2506,2.7292,1.0917,1.0677,1.6964,0.233,2.8214,6.1181,0.6762,1.6335,2.6287,0.0955,4.047,0.2388,0.316,0.6225,0.0002,3.248,3.4981,5.9954,0.1901,4.3089,4.2003,0.6888,4.2115,2.6836,5.7416,7.1089,1.5286,1.1925,1.2231,3.8184,3.1325,7.586,1.9785,2.8242,0.0007,0.3442,4.1617,3.4342,0.2278,1.6729,4.6858,4.2298,0.231,3.2703,2.9464,1.4707,5.0095,3.4309,14.1141,6.0655,2.0615,6.2953,0.8427,0.2793,3.3648,3.4201,1.8515,3.9482,2.4522,0.3468,2.5581,3.8071,1.0399,0.1604]}

{"id":4480,"ended":true,"length":267,"text":"Slimmy started working on the album with his longtime producers Quico Serrano and Mark Turner by the third quarter of 2009. Saul Davies was first set to be the producer of the album, however the project was abandoned by his long-term production partner, Mike White who also worked with the band on the record, and while Saul has not commented on whether he'll be working on the album since \"I really have no idea\", he did reveal the new singer is working with a new producer named Jack O'Brien, who has been around the band for quite a while. Saul and Jack have a good and working relationship and are really good friends, which is why we expect the new singer will be spending plenty of time on vocals with the band. The last album has not been a huge success as its lead single was only released in its first single, but there was some good news about this year with their second album \"The Lost Highway\", they've also worked together again and this time the song is actually very personal and very poetic. Mike White also shared some good news with the band. The band signed an incredible deal that brought them a long-term contract for a full album and have begun releasing music that will reflect the singer's personal life and love for singing.\n\nPaging Saul\n\nIf you enjoy this article, please consider supporting us as well as supporting the site.","token_len":280,"entropy":[9.63,6.2618,8.9477,4.5398,1.284,1.5905,5.8584,2.8188,2.5262,3.9219,7.8981,8.6706,7.5028,8.6881,1.167,0.3212,5.2109,7.4817,7.9796,1.2343,6.9346,2.8489,0.0343,3.0008,0.4214,12.0157,9.0187,2.569,6.223,6.7719,0.4333,4.3298,1.9092,3.206,2.5424,0.6254,1.1292,1.0751,5.1102,3.3469,3.2586,0.8393,4.1068,2.3927,2.8824,5.5588,0.4082,2.3768,5.3916,0.3751,1.7133,4.3919,6.1308,4.5059,3.9616,1.2809,1.5489,2.3947,1.4963,1.3651,1.5109,3.5907,3.0263,1.6068,5.9137,2.2503,4.4491,3.63,2.9091,0.741,2.8589,0.9522,3.5248,1.0472,2.65,0.5127,0.7728,0.6945,5.7979,5.3054,2.0333,4.9789,3.7275,0.3194,0.2983,3.5336,0.5212,1.9544,3.5184,3.5687,4.5976,6.5962,3.396,2.8696,2.2711,3.1739,1.7387,1.3341,3.696,5.4714,4.386,0.255,1.6382,2.065,0.6605,2.272,1.6885,5.2321,2.2449,1.3752,1.0854,3.8614,1.4019,0.1894,0.5782,5.5159,4.1541,1.5775,2.3627,3.4538,3.5683,5.7499,5.8335,0.0567,2.076,2.7354,5.8179,1.9535,0.1107,1.5743,3.2531,1.1752,2.2038,3.5849,5.9789,1.8862,2.4134,2.037,2.0217,0.6983,6.7423,5.0192,0.1051,0.0074,2.3589,6.4546,2.7718,1.8732,0.6114,0.8937,3.261,5.2049,3.3541,5.2154,3.5704,0.4848,3.9818,2.2198,0.5753,3.6469,4.3836,4.3365,0.3718,2.6101,4.2411,0.7575,1.0046,4.2097,1.5117,5.2425,1.3186,2.5476,3.8419,2.5871,2.7228,2.807,1.5844,2.8742,3.4546,3.7749,4.167,5.2851,2.5982,2.0007,3.1365,2.8672,6.0944,4.6352,1.4607,6.3058,2.1201,2.8318,4.5673,1.6945,3.6097,2.5221,3.2249,0.5514,2.6477,2.9133,1.4544,3.9785,3.7794,5.4157,1.8333,3.2412,6.6734,0.6043,6.3597,0.8187,2.9407,3.7802,1.6765,3.6255,0.5537,1.9857,1.6853,1.8812,3.6872,2.9839,2.0615,6.5576,4.0857,4.9875,0.824,4.5792,4.6992,0.6917,2.4124,5.0227,0.9091,0.413,1.7324,3.1901,2.0917,2.9262,3.3842,2.2184,5.6783,5.809,3.3984,4.359,3.9766,2.0251,7.1879,1.4138,5.1181,0.1323,2.967,0.6482,1.6906,4.8606,2.1586,6.0028,0.7297,2.1445,0.0971,5.5998,7.7059,2.968,4.8064,0.0002,4.4044,0.3016,4.5743,2.2462,1.5029,0.927,0.8564,0.7998,1.2811,0.7411,5.4566,3.2707,2.213,4.0728,2.0299,2.9877,2.4829]}

The Russian authorities chose not to let everyone get into the film, which was also the Russian film that had been scheduled to come out only a few weeks back and to be screened at the UK cinemas.\"\nAs for critics, critics and reviewers alike were unanimous in stating that the film was \"good\" but not worth the money.","token_len":280,"entropy":[8.6611,11.2427,5.8637,6.4435,6.8707,2.2175,0.1445,0.0,4.4945,3.0518,5.9017,6.7535,2.7832,0.2087,4.3702,3.4716,0.5819,1.9265,0.0258,3.6177,14.2128,5.2574,8.1398,9.3169,5.4551,2.2134,5.2794,0.0472,6.4007,0.6898,0.5412,2.1661,4.1363,2.6034,7.9919,4.5857,7.2366,1.0328,0.567,2.404,4.8932,0.8841,1.8703,5.4764,1.5043,3.3041,3.0784,2.7122,3.5119,1.393,1.3274,4.6103,2.2906,1.8991,3.6824,3.5005,1.9436,1.141,3.8648,0.4371,0.0965,0.002,1.1182,1.0367,1.65,2.9549,0.9657,0.8815,0.2242,3.0205,2.7239,0.6347,4.238,2.0184,0.8134,1.9002,4.1832,4.8231,1.7526,4.536,1.3639,5.7598,7.0405,0.4667,1.552,4.5319,1.1697,0.7834,6.7531,3.4897,1.7561,5.6902,7.9164,3.8881,3.5266,0.4981,0.7387,0.696,8.9244,3.6358,1.42,1.968,0.7861,7.1449,1.6964,2.4718,4.2765,4.893,0.6201,5.0183,2.0788,6.9134,0.7012,2.4631,6.1045,3.9916,5.6783,5.1935,5.4237,5.1829,0.2849,5.0613,6.0459,0.7964,3.5568,2.6564,6.0729,0.3364,5.8341,3.0922,1.2297,1.3787,1.6322,6.2628,4.3093,4.9576,2.9554,1.2573,3.5048,0.0258,0.01,0.0001,5.0543,4.0265,3.9126,0.2793,0.0056,0.6599,0.4612,1.8207,0.2127,0.5428,0.7678,5.1927,3.6904,1.0188,3.7171,2.3063,2.5741,5.4785,1.01,0.0068,0.9237,5.2538,1.0806,1.564,7.2686,4.8245,4.1754,1.8465,2.3369,5.6535,4.1225,2.7573,1.2958,7.54,4.6815,1.3404,2.5066,1.5041,1.0789,6.4785,0.1928,4.5693,5.5581,2.2549,0.4244,1.0055,1.9789,1.8316,3.0532,5.6773,4.1956,0.7656,4.1797,1.6918,2.5738,1.2641,2.2338,1.4556,3.2502,4.2846,2.8031,2.5101,0.8468,4.6469,3.038,0.0029,1.1223,1.4519,1.9778,1.347,1.5892,3.4716,2.903,5.9147,1.5387,0.005,4.0193,7.896,4.4633,2.1839,0.5291,1.3476,1.5925,2.933,1.9245,4.055,2.8185,6.8529,3.3012,2.1601,3.3964,1.0382,5.2501,0.8187,4.3665,0.8127,5.5015,1.0262,0.73,1.0821,3.3252,3.6421,4.3336,1.477,2.9716,1.9592,0.6503,3.5012,3.8149,0.0046,2.5772,0.2792,3.9878,1.6862,5.4623,0.4569,5.0197,3.6555,3.3376,1.4249,3.2141,5.2673,0.8455,3.1835,0.332,0.5912,0.6981,1.5807,2.8248,3.8358,1.7317,3.146,2.6122,4.5786,1.5736,1.5406,0.7619]}

Picking up a new name it serves as a place for people who \"have\" been baptized at the parish, while continuing a Christian tradition. There are two main functions of Pine Hill: church and parish. A church (which is an old-style chapel) is a main service area for Church; a parish, located in the historic church building, consists of a main parish (small parish, if you'll use that term, of 3,000 Catholics), and a two-seat parish (small parish if you'll use that term, too). The main church has a choir, but the primary work to do to help people reach their goal is making people think and pray at church. As we've mentioned before, the church was built in the 18th century.\n\n\"Pine is the heart of our community in North Charleston. It served our community very well from its original beginning, when we laid the first stone\" says Thomas Deans.

The South was defeated in the battle, with the loss of nearly all of the Southern army being the loss of a great part of the American army.

Few details survive of the organ \u2013 the French are likely to have replaced it in a much sooner date. The organ was destroyed at the Battle of L\u00e9opold (1789), while another, from the year 1774, was discovered hidden in the basement of a bar at the Louvre. The restoration of the organ at the Louvre involved reconstruction of 18 or 21 bodies and a new organ. The Louvre is home to the Louvre Museum, which opened in 1989. The restored organ will be auctioned at auction in London (August 25th).\n\nOne particular organ has been preserved. In 1887 a British Museum organ was sold for \u00a37,000 in France. The rare organ \u2014 known as the \u201cClergy of the Holy Spirit\u201d \u2014 was kept under a conservatory in England by the late Norman Norman in 1776.

The state of West Virginia sought a flag design that could be produced inexpensively so that the state flag could remain relevant to the country, as long as it was produced in a state that produced the state flag. The flag was selected to be a symbol of the state in its home state of West Virginia as well as the state of Virginia being the capital city of the state.\n\nThe flag design was the final official design for the US flag, and the flag design was the flag for the presidency and Senate, although the US President of the United States had not formally accepted the design until 1933. Following the renaming of the US House of Representative from the House of Delegates in 1933 because the state flag was too expensive to produce commercially, Congress then agreed to create a public flag designating a state flag, which was to represent a \"state flag\", in the state of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe flag designs are the last design for the United States flag. In 1933, the state flag was designated the Senate flag by virtue of an inscription that followed the signature of Jefferson Davis.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nCitations\n\nExternal links\n\nhttp:\/\/www.stateofsw.edu\/\n http:\/\/www.penn.edu.penn.edu\/","token_len":282,"entropy":[9.2298,7.7449,13.8854,2.9433,7.0291,8.0613,2.1845,6.0241,1.8935,2.0027,0.4423,2.0128,4.9125,0.8426,1.8702,2.9015,3.9576,6.3865,1.2542,7.6044,2.5069,3.5401,1.2715,1.1076,3.5667,0.7501,6.7617,8.9566,0.0056,6.2526,0.6618,2.0708,1.3739,5.9634,0.7202,3.3497,4.9094,1.1899,0.8053,4.5902,3.1749,3.3879,2.0129,0.0105,0.5119,1.0847,4.0492,0.9411,0.89,1.6924,0.8651,4.428,1.3701,1.9798,0.7489,0.4572,1.47,1.6095,1.5417,5.3805,3.03,0.9715,2.417,2.8601,0.1999,1.4456,0.9824,3.7124,2.4579,4.9327,0.1004,1.7332,0.5883,0.0043,4.5292,1.2662,0.0274,1.667,1.4698,1.3526,1.9254,7.1019,1.4356,3.6644,3.3205,0.4671,0.8914,1.2767,0.4742,1.1637,0.0028,1.1614,1.212,2.1633,1.1338,4.3414,4.0773,5.8376,1.5828,1.9925,0.4956,5.3468,1.2312,2.6838,1.9981,2.1817,1.7631,3.0419,0.7567,3.3864,3.6534,3.6253,0.672,5.9072,2.8146,5.0716,2.9688,4.5685,1.2525,3.94,3.7327,5.0523,0.1831,0.2317,0.0241,2.8161,3.7537,4.1597,3.6291,0.3681,1.8398,1.365,3.7904,0.2554,6.0903,0.5923,7.2599,0.6892,0.2139,0.1382,2.2864,4.7498,0.1342,5.605,2.3186,1.9895,2.6734,0.3723,4.8197,0.003,2.2293,2.1328,7.1241,2.1075,4.0329,2.7412,0.8664,3.102,3.4354,1.3602,1.4171,5.7743,0.2712,3.8034,5.8428,5.7611,0.2736,3.062,0.6524,6.2385,1.0497,1.5225,7.2893,3.637,1.7318,3.5512,2.7097,1.7132,1.0621,2.9854,4.151,2.7837,4.2226,1.9984,3.5329,4.1649,3.6046,1.6566,3.1764,1.3015,5.4553,0.5368,1.3699,0.0002,0.9541,1.515,3.8638,4.1499,3.4443,4.5574,3.799,1.8362,0.3896,2.6144,0.0055,2.3341,1.5537,2.8358,4.0399,0.4174,0.7651,2.4491,0.9563,0.5646,4.666,1.1469,6.2718,1.546,2.843,7.6501,0.0238,4.6191,7.362,2.2631,7.1691,0.5133,5.2177,0.2115,6.7611,0.3177,1.9249,2.4698,0.0002,5.6397,1.1833,0.0003,3.5627,2.9571,0.6839,0.0002,2.5181,3.6007,2.4612,0.0002,6.4512,0.7773,0.4384,0.0002,3.3949,3.393,0.3436,0.0002,6.1439,0.1991,0.64,0.0002,5.1145,0.0006,0.4347,0.0009,4.1056,3.7579,7.4388,0.6749,5.6957,0.132,3.4154,15.1337,0.0002,0.3521,0.0009,4.5052,2.3041,2.9448,0.2489,4.3144,6.1316,0.7481,1.1037,0.0979,0.2028]}

The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in warfare between 3000 and 3000 BC was first reported. The first evidence for horse use in warfare, the invention of the horse, and the use of horses was probably in the 14th Century.\n\nIn spite of the widespread use of horse for fighting, the horse had never been used as a weapon. In ancient times, horses were used mainly as a protection against enemies. During these periods the horse was considered a valuable and useful weapon and was frequently used as a military tool in order to keep themselves safe against any enemy. One man named Charles Charles the Bull had built a barn on a hill above the city of Louth. This he sold for a price of 10,000 and it was later known that the bulls bulls were a very popular race. Charles Charles the Bull used a horse in many battle positions, the horse had to be in service during both wars, which would have been more than enough. Charles also had his name engraved on a number of horses and these were sometimes ridden or had their markings painted onto them. The horse also had to be treated in a professional manner, as it had to be kept in a dry environment. The term \"horse\" in many contexts is more generally recognized than in horse farming.","token_len":282,"entropy":[10.9081,4.3738,1.4773,3.613,1.4555,5.9737,1.2272,6.5612,0.0369,2.426,0.0942,0.9151,2.3308,3.3833,8.6901,1.3718,0.9061,0.35,3.8506,0.6221,0.6224,1.5559,1.4819,4.9483,4.1936,1.0663,2.9011,0.8843,1.4903,1.7749,2.0359,3.8839,0.0558,0.5114,1.2118,0.9049,4.6838,3.1616,0.3934,2.5635,0.7429,1.8855,2.75,2.3735,6.1993,1.8243,2.435,3.1035,2.2916,1.4686,1.1123,0.5347,0.4615,4.7119,3.6752,5.5551,0.057,1.8423,0.825,1.2295,2.191,0.5289,1.8168,0.0182,0.338,4.436,4.7117,2.7947,0.7867,4.7831,0.0701,3.2377,1.4978,2.026,0.0154,2.925,5.7123,0.0061,0.8582,3.9951,0.5065,0.0443,1.5004,2.8213,3.1139,0.5866,1.9962,2.174,3.2831,3.0281,0.2407,0.9979,1.7196,0.2781,0.7237,1.4613,2.308,4.5215,0.8914,0.6053,0.8314,0.3914,1.3456,3.2916,1.3521,2.3528,6.4061,1.2,4.326,1.3745,3.8917,4.243,2.7543,3.3124,1.6371,0.5689,3.2776,1.2461,4.4936,3.4999,2.3755,1.169,3.0528,1.483,4.5289,0.311,1.2989,0.2563,5.1879,1.7032,3.0874,4.8683,0.0092,4.1723,6.4525,1.974,3.9563,4.6755,2.1312,0.8092,5.5401,5.7716,2.4874,5.7122,5.7776,5.2061,4.3739,3.5833,4.9394,0.5232,5.8028,2.3101,1.9447,0.9673,5.1635,1.1061,2.9035,0.3551,4.2545,6.0222,1.7072,2.8317,5.1396,5.3418,1.6551,1.9399,3.9085,0.4013,3.3629,0.4923,0.0602,5.8118,3.69,0.4867,3.7744,4.5677,1.2135,1.6625,5.6127,8.1722,1.2159,4.1276,4.0764,2.4189,5.6538,2.4465,3.7641,3.0759,1.2179,0.0717,3.4266,1.8649,1.945,3.6453,3.6683,4.0862,6.3998,1.6713,4.6369,3.0488,4.4149,3.9425,0.3675,4.4396,6.5487,3.2936,4.968,3.6317,2.2814,4.2733,3.7794,1.7716,1.5333,4.551,2.2547,1.9257,3.7861,3.9322,3.6255,2.0364,3.3193,6.5268,1.0467,0.2496,2.4277,6.0064,0.0067,1.6518,2.5734,5.5317,1.2555,3.9342,5.8643,5.9397,5.3561,1.1614,6.2356,2.4903,4.1913,0.6076,0.4099,2.0642,2.2585,3.1805,1.1316,2.0875,0.35,6.8156,2.1847,1.2352,6.1176,0.4306,1.384,2.5808,2.1491,2.5994,0.2354,0.338,2.3579,1.115,1.0433,5.6441,3.1974,1.6874,2.0081,5.7884,1.2293,1.0289,1.4886,3.2165,4.6773,4.5361,1.5368,4.7445,4.9574,6.6601,3.8157,2.9185,5.2857,6.7353,0.8419]}

The system gradually developed organized shower and thunderstorm activity. By September 1, the center was in the center of south Cuba, with a high maximum sustained hurricane winds of 39 mph (56 kph). However, due to an upper-level tropical disturbance, strong weather conditions were not expected to allow a tropical storm to form. On the day of the storm we lost 8.6 miles (13 km) of sustained winds, reaching its base at 6:13 am (1 hour, 38 minutes).\n\nThe storm peaked in the morning hours and remained as a tropical storm for several hours before dissipating on Sunday afternoon. The initial intensity of the storm and the likelihood of significant wind damage to structures was reduced by the circulation of the storm at 10:17 a.m.\n\nUpdate: On October 02, the Center for Tropical Storm Forecasting indicated that the storm is expected to pass through northwest and east Cuba this morning. The area of south Cuba is not known yet.\n\nRainfall totals will likely be between 12 and 15 inches (51 or 80 mm) across the central Caribbean and northwest Africa. Most of the tropical systems are expected to have a high number of rain.

{"id":3568,"ended":true,"length":251,"text":"As with all German battlecruisers that had been built, the Ersatz Yorck @ - @ class ships would have been equipped with four sets of Parsons turbine engines, each of which drove a different type of rocket. As was the case with all of them, three of them were based in Germany, the third, fourth and fifth of these was also in-house, the fourth was built in Poland. But there did exist a small number of prototypes, mostly prototypes, with smaller engines, the final prototype prototype being much larger, but with larger power generators and more powerful propellers.\n\nWith the help and help of German engineers, it was possible to make all of these ships from only one type of propeller, but it was the power of the propellers that came in a huge package as well. These propellers combined with the powerful torquey engines of the Fuhrman F-22 were a major part of the design for the L-24, and many of the more famous Fuhrmann guns had also been built that had a large propeller. That said, I would say that we have not achieved the mass required for production of all or most of these weapons - and that means that there are still some long way to go, but as long as we are still making the L-24, the Fuhrmann gun is certainly worth the money.","token_len":282,"entropy":[5.168,2.0439,9.0279,9.9358,5.1994,0.0662,5.5958,3.3884,0.9283,1.9892,2.2963,0.9049,6.1815,6.2815,0.6652,16.7622,6.0252,13.2606,7.5262,6.9427,9.0096,7.3493,4.0759,1.902,1.1138,4.3664,0.1191,5.0939,6.8895,0.0857,11.539,10.0627,1.318,1.5482,3.1666,2.1064,0.1012,6.7365,1.3056,3.592,3.1466,0.0204,4.7508,2.4212,4.2755,4.7858,0.97,0.2038,0.422,2.4629,3.201,4.4976,0.3156,6.6742,0.9307,1.4319,1.0177,4.5516,1.9755,2.2532,1.4746,2.7141,4.3314,4.202,9.0609,0.5293,0.438,4.3202,3.7914,2.8753,4.7086,2.5184,6.8064,1.1635,2.1419,3.8447,2.8812,1.6392,1.9937,0.5035,4.7897,1.2671,5.1793,3.8691,6.6758,1.6771,0.9325,3.2498,2.1513,0.065,5.9567,1.8731,4.1445,4.7819,3.0689,3.3529,6.1593,2.2444,1.6065,4.0243,4.2091,2.5978,9.0657,1.5361,6.5861,2.1678,1.6509,2.2911,2.9001,4.9489,5.2971,5.3358,2.0673,3.2233,1.7253,4.1017,0.0764,0.4498,1.6067,0.0448,4.6162,0.9131,5.1975,5.9804,2.722,0.0292,4.4713,1.7534,0.6607,3.8222,0.3278,2.1165,0.1408,3.076,4.1911,1.0795,0.6983,2.3296,3.6875,5.1581,1.7276,3.0655,0.1564,3.5858,0.0278,1.1436,2.3152,2.7064,0.5599,4.2859,4.8354,1.2669,0.6121,2.9429,0.7785,0.425,5.5393,3.9229,4.8399,2.3938,5.851,5.4376,0.9495,0.4713,3.5997,3.5807,0.1049,6.2753,1.4426,0.6077,4.9224,8.7702,2.6621,1.6357,1.7841,1.7585,0.2378,4.9479,3.007,2.1782,4.1208,4.5832,1.6599,3.7052,3.9755,3.1722,2.8957,1.8793,0.0205,0.2681,2.234,2.6745,0.4232,5.47,2.5397,4.3991,1.9772,1.691,5.2707,0.5592,0.6224,4.4131,2.7765,2.707,0.3855,0.0527,5.1775,4.5804,3.3636,2.8948,0.2597,0.8514,6.17,2.968,2.6359,2.985,3.3847,0.0234,1.0633,5.4918,4.6952,0.0428,5.2638,2.9528,2.3508,0.3508,5.4205,3.0972,3.3632,4.7149,1.3372,5.2196,2.8854,0.9712,4.5353,0.7219,2.702,7.8489,1.5616,0.0825,0.5289,3.3999,4.1818,3.1795,1.8572,4.9648,0.6313,2.9814,1.4131,1.5722,2.0482,5.8085,2.0418,0.1108,0.0102,2.9757,1.9311,4.3002,2.5355,0.005,0.9318,1.9492,5.107,3.4308,2.3195,3.4702,0.0646,0.0387,1.226,2.3575,3.0821,0.0186,0.0103,1.3779,2.8907,1.9785,4.0663,3.7914,1.976,2.5449,0.5195]}

{"id":3043,"ended":true,"length":258,"text":"Smallpox virus was a major cause of death in the 20th century, killing about 300 million people. It has probably killed more humans than any other virus. In 1966 an agreement was reached between the governments of France and the US. The first two doses of the vaccine were provided to the US by the end of 1964. Today, only about 500-700,000 doses of vaccine are administered. But now people in rural regions around the world can take the jab. The US has the most mass vaccination program, with more than 18 million doses administered this year.\nThis is because the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine were produced in large batches. Moderna's vaccine had an overall production capacity of almost 1 million doses. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines made use of the same technology as Moderna's but were different - there was no need to scale up production lines to handle a large mass scale production.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the vaccine that is in use in the US is 100 percent effective against all symptomatic Covid-19 infections. It has given a positive result in 70 out of 100 tests using data for the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy.

{"id":4430,"ended":true,"length":254,"text":"Until 1940, Petoskey had been coaching in the offseason, while still playing baseball in the summers. In August 1940, he announced his retirement as a player to take a full @Giants job, and the next summer he went on to a much stronger spring. He would leave Poughkeepsie, New York, where he was also on-court, and would end up making the U.S. National Guard for World War II. He was hired by General George Washington, to be the Mets\u2019 manager, and would win the White House.\n\nAt one point, Petoskey called it quits on baseball, but became a better manager than even the most successful player in baseball (George Washington, 1918). During his career, he won the Negro League Championship in 1943. Petoskey was first hired as GM of the Mets on February 12, 1944. As the starting GM, he was forced to go 2\u201342 in his first five years, but the Mets finished with.919 in games played. In that season, the Mets finished 5\u201330, dropping all the major league seasons. They were in a bad place at the time and were only good for six years and one playoff season.

It has been suggested that, like the attack on the Suez Canal in 1915, it was merely a matter of time before the British-led US invasion of the East Sea invaded and occupied the island. It is worth remembering, while the battle of Romani may have been captured, the fighting is ongoing through the streets of the island of Romani, with the majority of the island itself not visible from the American mainland.\n\nIf you'd like to read more about the battles fought during the 19th Century, check and watch the video below:\n\nThe Battle of Romani is a historical event which occurred in 1915 (or even later) during the Franco-Prussian war and was a major part of the French-American War. It was the first time France fought a conflict similar to that of the 19th Century. In addition to the numerous atrocities that took place during World War II, the Battle of Romani is in most areas of both Europe and America.\n\nThe fight in Romani also shows how the French fought against the Anglo-American civil war and British-backed anti-Suez siege. Both French and British civil wars (and later the American civil war) were not part of France\u2019s larger battle plans for the South Atlantic as well as their planned invasion of the East Sea.","token_len":283,"entropy":[9.0128,0.5433,8.4131,9.2121,5.7839,6.2917,3.0171,0.0036,1.6162,8.6719,3.1883,5.5343,1.9616,3.9865,1.2328,3.4699,1.5458,1.338,3.5299,0.1853,4.2369,4.1127,1.203,7.6416,0.2692,1.115,6.3428,1.3023,0.0178,1.6085,4.3985,0.1928,1.6626,0.6412,5.844,0.6821,3.8541,0.0074,0.8202,0.0534,1.0349,3.3995,5.8333,2.2452,5.7586,1.6013,0.467,1.6272,4.9962,6.1542,7.7903,2.8859,1.3678,0.8765,4.1806,1.7632,3.1182,1.2218,4.2336,2.3672,2.3452,7.8066,1.2834,4.5992,1.5461,0.5677,0.0009,2.7757,0.8375,0.5057,5.9988,2.6801,1.39,5.5054,4.0399,4.5249,6.857,0.7637,6.5516,0.2318,1.9391,2.8384,3.7345,2.9779,0.0465,1.3612,2.668,1.8912,4.8164,0.087,0.9602,2.55,6.9464,5.481,5.6402,2.1028,0.4534,7.8376,4.2912,0.273,0.918,0.0291,4.9969,2.1777,4.6564,0.0808,0.0874,1.7983,0.484,0.5746,0.5652,3.4601,4.8924,3.5297,0.3028,6.7729,0.0116,1.9071,0.8417,2.1345,9.884,2.7258,1.1321,2.0786,0.7476,1.5401,0.6783,0.0002,2.4348,1.2023,0.0515,0.1918,0.0017,1.7343,1.5678,3.726,1.9684,3.1266,4.4597,1.176,5.6778,4.9176,3.7842,4.9916,1.9049,0.9676,1.967,0.4763,5.8244,0.0928,1.6058,0.0048,1.4539,3.1797,1.9128,2.9609,1.8573,3.3825,0.013,0.3215,3.8561,1.9205,1.8865,1.866,0.7549,1.543,1.0741,1.941,1.3598,2.0703,3.2863,4.0616,1.5864,5.1317,5.477,0.0705,1.6169,0.9894,0.3154,2.8475,0.0101,0.4732,1.0851,3.03,3.4531,0.4803,0.7337,5.3422,4.2806,2.4047,2.512,0.0012,0.6518,4.4312,0.0007,2.903,0.3149,0.8621,1.8064,0.0533,0.0325,0.0029,2.0778,6.1028,6.8057,4.85,0.7105,6.7929,1.2769,0.0276,1.6634,1.2017,1.0354,0.0002,2.0404,5.5567,3.251,1.0392,0.01,4.7461,5.6613,1.8221,1.1582,2.1908,3.4922,2.266,0.6726,5.4938,0.0186,0.5773,7.8553,0.6717,2.8324,6.4937,2.029,3.4157,3.6154,0.0335,5.8851,1.3686,8.6964,1.7503,4.2684,4.4893,0.1492,0.4326,5.4295,1.4459,5.32,1.589,4.2923,2.0508,2.8619,2.5044,0.1625,0.2433,1.332,5.9657,5.6766,0.0011,4.0411,14.7619,7.7047,4.9359,5.6631,5.0951,5.7137,2.8626,0.7772,5.201,2.0545,5.0133,3.8424,0.1898,3.7169,5.4402,1.7755,0.201,1.0113,3.7156,2.1197,0.5429]}

Nixon resigned on 25 October 1977.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"The People's Republic of Thailand\" article","token_len":283,"entropy":[8.1335,12.0026,6.7273,4.3722,4.6463,6.054,3.5737,0.0808,5.9321,0.7053,6.3287,3.1113,0.3797,5.6983,4.5243,0.8392,0.5369,2.5479,2.8103,0.6517,0.3311,7.5448,13.6039,6.9657,10.0055,1.0405,2.5158,1.3282,2.8756,5.1169,2.2154,5.0711,2.4937,4.6721,0.2056,0.7363,5.4886,0.9099,6.3917,5.3354,0.6053,0.3366,0.1112,1.8402,5.6068,5.3671,1.7392,6.1476,0.0313,0.1833,1.5259,2.3733,3.0888,6.5818,4.7541,5.2624,2.8186,1.4712,1.1554,1.1521,5.3823,1.4759,2.8239,2.1128,1.063,1.0565,1.5406,2.6923,1.2996,1.5442,3.5413,4.2669,2.076,0.795,1.8301,7.3667,1.9336,3.3717,5.194,1.5915,2.8291,5.7555,0.8294,1.1419,3.9683,0.1888,2.6241,1.4855,1.7236,0.0464,1.8487,2.857,5.0886,4.9652,0.7811,6.0668,1.144,5.5944,3.2977,1.2846,1.6701,2.342,0.0076,2.9745,3.2852,1.0464,1.8025,1.3611,4.9584,4.8012,5.6541,3.1258,1.6788,0.1256,3.1565,1.4929,0.5787,1.1906,6.588,0.0007,4.2808,2.1005,3.124,0.8686,4.2045,7.3722,1.4883,1.2384,0.8161,0.0147,2.4236,4.6392,5.3747,0.2502,1.8735,3.4171,6.0702,2.0342,0.516,2.1926,2.12,0.2838,0.3946,0.8452,0.0013,5.2976,3.6134,5.6909,0.7664,2.287,3.3352,0.0797,1.6063,0.6268,0.433,2.1595,3.7613,1.2674,8.2717,2.1705,0.2724,0.402,0.7572,1.1246,0.4312,3.0787,5.6832,5.2163,0.3792,1.1257,0.0051,5.8241,3.0538,4.0419,4.197,1.0279,1.2153,4.2823,2.6043,5.3865,1.0613,1.4871,0.2465,1.3609,6.1,6.5659,1.0062,5.593,5.1637,5.0888,3.4401,1.6224,1.0077,5.8756,3.1678,3.8812,7.3272,0.9201,0.2626,1.3742,2.0394,2.8609,2.3721,2.1788,5.6221,5.0863,9.1553,1.1129,2.1759,4.5439,0.7132,0.385,1.1335,2.3941,2.8497,0.2792,2.2818,1.1534,4.3453,1.0165,1.8109,0.1519,2.5875,6.1243,0.0132,2.2041,3.2961,5.2033,1.1376,8.0789,0.0427,6.0291,3.4671,2.9395,6.7305,0.887,4.5043,0.4316,0.9291,0.0002,3.4055,3.6917,6.4003,4.1197,2.5259,3.9692,0.1538,1.1564,2.5287,1.9911,5.2373,2.8632,2.4861,3.5124,2.3317,2.1785,0.5743,3.2743,3.6347,2.1944,3.8925,3.9166,0.5728,1.1168,1.9679,0.0002,6.079,0.9001,0.0003,5.7424,0.5591,0.7428,0.0003,6.0983,2.2389,5.3194,0.0345,1.4945,0.0419,1.2084,1.858,6.1147]}
{"id":1868,"ended":true,"length":268,"text":"Since the beginning of river commerce and industrial development in the 1800s, the Missouri has been severely polluted and its water quality degraded by human activity. Most of the river's floodplain habitat is within Missouri, the surrounding states, and the federal states. More than 50% of the Missouri river water comes from wetlands, while a small fraction comes from streams, tributaries, and lakes.\nMissouri has a population of more than 2 million; the metropolitan area with the largest population is Fort Wayne. If you live in the Missouri, you are likely to encounter a variety of different kinds of fish, and all of them are of concern to both you and your fishing gear. Missouri also has several other fish species, including manta rays, blue crabs, and herring.\n\nThe most famous fish in Missouri are salmon. The Missouri is one of the few states with a population of less than 500, a typical population of 200. The state also hosts a large fish population in the Great Lakes and is known for its red-eye salmon fishery.\n\nThe color of salmon depends on the species and the size of the salmon in the river. Most lakes or rivers in Missouri have a rainbow hue and red fish cover the whole area. All the rivers in Kansas and Missouri have red salmon. The Kansas River is the largest river in Kansas and as long as it carries north the river flows north.","token_len":283,"entropy":[2.3024,4.7307,0.2422,13.1112,8.224,3.5946,5.2183,2.5202,1.6954,0.9387,5.0341,0.1754,0.3159,1.6716,7.9429,7.124,1.3652,7.4078,3.8761,2.4272,3.931,2.6159,1.4963,5.3054,1.8212,4.4961,1.3694,0.5279,5.5791,0.8095,0.2646,2.599,0.8582,6.9974,1.7062,6.0145,1.054,4.6254,6.2804,2.5018,4.3284,5.7249,3.9779,1.1275,0.2771,1.3188,4.5284,4.8796,0.6802,5.6812,0.1972,3.3366,1.6353,0.0133,0.3392,1.561,2.729,4.4529,2.7359,0.0622,4.976,1.2818,4.6862,3.5643,3.2456,2.4067,1.6264,0.0266,2.6847,1.5866,6.1079,0.0022,0.0027,0.2614,0.3792,2.3377,0.2779,1.3476,15.9583,0.0615,2.5615,1.9309,2.754,0.068,2.6518,0.0066,2.8966,0.5757,5.2342,2.3089,7.6387,0.1374,5.5699,0.3322,0.8058,1.1402,0.591,4.9186,1.7886,1.9155,6.237,1.2377,2.4388,0.352,1.4695,2.0547,1.5673,0.8914,2.1278,1.7469,0.3215,4.1033,1.9131,2.9179,0.0015,3.8148,3.321,0.003,3.8977,0.9853,3.2343,5.599,0.7413,0.7282,1.2728,5.679,5.3592,0.5679,4.6079,3.1412,0.0215,0.7914,5.1884,4.6743,0.1027,4.2148,4.0495,0.2873,3.4439,2.8112,3.9926,0.9299,1.4195,1.1016,5.5423,3.5467,0.1356,0.2757,3.599,3.7111,0.0455,1.4199,6.357,0.117,0.4086,1.0248,6.7247,2.3462,3.7079,5.0675,1.5043,1.3026,0.5367,1.9136,4.7023,2.0219,1.9628,2.3056,2.9903,2.657,0.0048,0.3741,2.2776,0.2665,2.2766,1.6197,3.1431,0.4889,2.2349,0.0013,3.3393,0.3873,8.2721,6.2451,2.4191,1.2796,4.2877,1.3792,1.7218,3.528,2.2336,4.5004,1.957,2.0595,3.4989,0.9664,3.1339,0.8271,4.2324,1.0772,2.3286,3.6322,2.6811,0.4484,0.3501,5.2668,1.7708,3.861,1.9745,3.0562,0.0132,0.22,1.2688,0.0002,1.9955,7.3843,0.7439,4.4802,4.1509,0.2535,1.0455,2.588,2.0495,1.7805,3.2459,0.1209,0.5243,2.4573,3.7819,1.4252,1.8385,0.317,3.9568,6.5265,5.3185,1.0995,1.3419,0.7739,0.5994,1.484,5.32,4.1671,3.2087,4.1422,5.3605,6.8131,2.8527,5.1878,1.9678,0.3895,5.7894,2.9466,2.0666,0.6389,5.4389,1.7481,1.4384,0.3597,2.8945,3.3003,1.3936,1.8094,4.8995,0.8403,1.6151,1.7478,2.0441,1.4737,0.1136,2.8635,1.2546,6.5795,4.7637,0.049,1.6454,5.8901,9.3042,4.0071,1.0216,2.0965,2.7588,1.2992]}

{"id":2815,"ended":false,"length":258,"text":"Vitruvius = = = = = The influential Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius argued that the design of a building such as a temple depends on two qualities, proportion and symmetria. Proportion ensures that the temple can be built with as little as possible of space between the foundation and the wall, thereby preventing water contamination, and symmetry ensures a complete symmetry between the temple-ground, the ceiling and the wall. Proportion makes a difference in architecture, with respect to the length of space between the foundation and the wall, thus maintaining order in the building, in comparison to the height of the surrounding wall, or walls, and hence of the temple. The reason for this difference in symmetry is the use of symmetric walls due to the combination of height between the foundation and the wall and because the building is made as thin as possible to prevent water contamination. Proportion is important because of its ability to maintain architectural harmony with minimal mechanical requirements. Thus, the design of a temple, like that of Christianity or the architecture of Spain, is in most areas equally beneficial to the natural environment, due to its ability to absorb water and give an adequate appearance to the walls and ceilings.\n\nSee also\n Aqueous architecture, a form of architecture in which building and structure are linked by connections\n Architecture of Rome\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n The Architecture of Rome in Rome in Ancient Greece","token_len":284,"entropy":[6.9337,6.0744,0.4349,1.8606,7.6354,7.1117,1.3648,0.7041,0.3729,7.7856,11.4054,8.767,1.9546,6.6625,7.1864,0.0041,0.0165,0.0036,8.4735,0.3665,1.3267,6.5352,0.4369,2.1137,3.275,6.2989,0.01,1.4895,2.6029,7.8591,0.3766,5.2504,5.6685,2.614,6.6743,0.5403,7.8673,1.8323,5.9432,0.6232,7.3591,1.2409,7.1399,0.9894,0.8043,4.1993,3.2381,0.9287,2.3099,2.1446,5.0208,1.9292,1.639,1.5197,1.761,5.3856,2.4175,0.7116,3.9618,0.6267,0.5418,3.6443,1.3015,5.4724,2.9617,5.996,4.6382,2.5708,1.3624,1.5211,1.2147,3.9954,5.0133,1.8509,1.8933,0.2881,3.8656,6.5192,4.5021,3.1261,1.3697,4.152,0.609,0.2382,3.0839,0.2659,5.0388,0.0623,5.0378,2.6849,4.403,0.5567,5.3919,1.4323,4.3764,5.3442,0.0069,1.2075,4.6692,0.2321,4.9832,0.5789,0.2708,2.1934,0.1157,0.1693,0.3177,1.1244,4.0511,4.3852,5.6724,2.3516,0.5833,0.8132,2.2823,5.0775,5.3738,0.4311,2.4585,3.9332,0.3506,0.2353,5.0619,2.5015,2.4135,2.9157,6.2226,2.0149,2.4775,4.3664,4.2636,0.716,3.2422,0.7786,1.7339,5.377,1.0094,1.0186,2.6163,1.6922,2.3779,0.4775,2.7684,4.3557,0.0207,3.8127,2.6034,3.2993,7.02,0.0083,0.5819,5.7301,0.017,4.3619,4.9095,0.2135,1.4398,0.087,0.1164,0.2908,3.4709,5.3591,1.4109,2.7054,1.2707,3.3462,5.3301,6.4956,0.0639,0.0347,2.7825,1.6168,0.9129,0.7467,0.6616,4.6164,0.0906,1.6796,3.5497,1.6563,2.6918,1.6732,2.7009,0.0204,3.7251,6.3851,3.6245,2.264,7.3845,6.5562,4.6717,0.7484,4.6605,0.4534,1.7847,3.7368,0.213,0.5804,1.0208,3.2324,3.793,1.2775,0.1579,10.3863,2.6655,1.9276,4.072,0.038,6.358,0.2737,1.5691,4.7515,5.622,6.0222,5.7404,6.2486,0.9238,0.7681,4.7773,0.9257,1.6545,4.8985,0.1104,0.8044,2.8827,0.0106,5.6019,1.5892,1.5433,5.9649,3.7758,3.1843,5.936,0.706,0.3391,4.9599,1.3694,1.8322,0.5091,1.5934,0.0109,5.6073,0.554,1.7235,14.4954,6.0407,0.0077,5.8119,1.9791,4.2671,4.7578,0.1265,1.9511,2.7485,0.8157,4.836,4.2662,3.5114,0.6188,4.4348,1.9831,6.3607,4.5309,28.7754,2.1954,3.4451,2.6011,0.0003,4.3059,0.9241,0.0004,4.7003,0.2642,0.5068,13.6587,3.6693,0.122,0.2691,4.7038,4.5975,5.0808,2.8558,2.8599]}

The book is based on the book Sex and the Politics of Female Advertising, a collection of interviews, research and analysis of the social, economical and political dynamics that influence how women are perceived, portrayed, and marketed through the television, radio, and social networks.\n\nIn the book Sex and the Politics of Female Advertising, Goffman discusses the role of women, in advertising and the political dynamics that affect how women are perceived, and how they are portrayed through television, radio, and social networks. This book also explores the dynamics of sexual relations between men and women that have had the opposite effect because men have been attracted to them to the point that people often feel reluctant to be his or her true girlfriend \u2014 and this tendency of women to conform to male sexual desires.\n\nGoffman is author of an award-winning series that covers the issue of sexual adoration, which has focused heavily on themes of women, gender and reproduction.

However much we love to hate on drafting guys with no prospects in the 2nd and 3rd rounds in order to have a guy like Ingram, Dawson, or DeAndre Baker make a splash in the first round, the fact is that you can't take a first-round pick unless you're confident that the quarterback you select is a true NFL prospect\n\nSo what should we watch for in the first round, and do we even need to take more than a 1st rounder?","token_len":284,"entropy":[5.6143,0.6723,9.9483,13.8726,9.6539,5.6526,11.5256,10.4398,0.0192,1.8159,8.3509,2.0189,2.1077,8.4523,0.0157,1.2939,5.2839,2.8991,0.0115,0.0001,10.6696,5.2557,2.7988,1.4934,0.6881,6.3323,0.2913,0.3588,4.8693,4.8198,3.3536,1.4764,5.911,1.4935,0.5751,1.5331,2.2692,2.8978,3.4564,6.5069,4.8022,2.6428,4.8961,3.1435,3.2494,3.9463,1.9541,3.1573,3.7465,2.857,2.8478,4.9305,7.5792,3.1411,4.9374,1.029,2.7289,4.1983,8.5368,4.3193,4.6246,5.5811,0.0327,1.5976,0.4841,4.0484,1.8643,6.3408,2.6605,4.6775,1.4229,5.0455,3.9848,0.0622,5.4649,1.1742,0.872,0.1148,2.2597,1.3843,3.4433,3.5433,1.0016,4.901,2.4424,0.2956,2.7803,5.1579,1.9156,0.6187,5.9449,0.9602,1.1194,3.6867,4.5512,2.5169,1.2819,0.2046,4.6633,1.1319,3.9187,2.0846,4.7189,0.345,3.2405,5.0982,1.1144,0.8725,2.8854,0.1632,2.5072,3.8305,1.6595,5.0353,2.9588,6.3754,2.9216,2.9584,0.4362,0.0823,3.5347,5.9815,5.4615,1.8001,2.5209,0.0932,2.1711,4.3402,1.4746,5.2912,3.3492,2.651,1.9381,0.4345,5.1116,3.0234,4.0722,0.4726,8.3963,0.4847,6.8724,2.0616,1.9749,4.5925,1.2892,5.8688,1.2143,1.388,0.0174,5.0464,4.3747,1.9717,2.1617,5.2209,0.0034,3.8286,2.2948,3.0805,0.0817,5.4505,2.5336,1.9125,3.6995,0.3535,0.6106,1.3708,2.996,1.2026,1.8998,4.1382,4.732,9.3104,4.1231,0.6546,5.014,4.0623,1.4465,5.5602,0.6391,2.3864,1.2051,0.1849,4.1202,1.5555,1.3096,3.7297,6.863,1.8061,2.5191,2.1715,3.781,2.0818,6.5405,4.7391,2.3134,3.8954,5.0064,1.8433,0.8017,7.2704,0.3776,3.2339,0.2839,0.0016,0.6533,4.6352,3.4906,0.0262,3.8297,1.5987,5.7086,1.6748,1.4109,2.3723,9.1923,0.6736,2.1376,4.5865,1.3933,12.8497,4.4905,2.7227,2.5649,1.6417,0.74,1.8877,0.2148,1.2347,2.5301,2.6816,1.0858,0.5579,3.8066,1.6971,0.5286,4.4253,1.5969,5.2797,0.569,0.3281,0.5265,5.5598,0.3721,1.1546,5.3301,0.9306,2.0784,3.3253,1.453,4.0183,1.3424,1.92,3.9386,4.1173,3.0259,8.3218,0.0003,3.6158,2.0247,3.8837,0.7505,4.4011,0.7896,1.171,0.9558,2.341,0.1511,3.7266,1.3213,3.9708,0.9833,3.8487,2.0148,0.3514,3.5641,5.5106,2.1174,2.1305,3.4401,0.363,1.5189,3.2124,0.982]}

{"id":642,"ended":true,"length":264,"text":"Polka Party! was released October 21, 1986. After it was released, the album peaked at number 177 on the Billboard 200. Compared to Yankovic's previous albums \u2014 Dare to Dream, Pavement, and Unbreakable... (with a much stronger release \"Punch the Pusher\") \u2013 Polka Party is a much deeper, more complicated experience, with a more poetic and lyrical sound. The song is written in a simple, easy to understand language with a clear tone. It is a very powerful, powerful song, in which one listens. It is performed by a talented artist, and I enjoy playing it on my own behalf. \"In my heart\" is also performed on the album by the talented DJ, Naloxone, and has a catchy, but deep quality. With all those songs, \"Polka Party\" has become a favorite of Yankovic. The album was a best-selling album in the UK in November 1986, and was nominated for 2 awards and won the European Album of the Year award. \"In my heart\" has been described by several UK music reviewers as \"a powerful, powerful song\" and by British DJ and producer, Paul Stirling. The song became a top-ten hit in the UK, as well as internationally and internationally. The album sold out the next day, and sold as widely as it was sold in the United States.","token_len":284,"entropy":[8.3849,8.8634,7.5722,8.1767,4.3503,6.9134,3.5552,0.819,5.7582,0.8297,4.9308,4.4328,1.1002,0.8531,0.6488,1.5782,5.7724,5.2405,0.0352,0.6274,8.375,0.4178,0.0741,0.9473,0.4321,0.8388,9.5066,0.0864,7.963,5.252,0.7446,0.3077,2.3286,2.3792,7.3034,12.3379,2.041,3.3564,1.2183,5.7801,3.646,0.7814,1.1692,6.2577,2.2606,0.009,8.9783,2.6268,4.5423,3.1417,5.8968,4.5617,4.0956,8.4985,4.2018,4.4875,4.1647,5.6544,6.127,1.0385,6.9628,9.5588,0.0016,0.7284,1.9487,1.9523,3.0814,5.4078,1.7775,0.7705,6.5122,3.9746,2.0772,1.9803,1.5387,2.3096,5.9517,1.8805,3.5971,0.042,4.2068,0.671,2.1714,2.8804,2.0063,3.387,1.7757,1.5605,4.782,1.1378,4.9819,1.4495,0.7506,2.0605,2.8554,1.2003,3.9621,4.2184,1.7648,1.911,1.4296,1.8389,3.302,4.6051,2.2567,4.0327,0.9052,1.155,4.9508,1.8308,4.1659,4.558,6.4088,2.0676,0.9749,7.9464,1.6034,2.0934,4.1764,4.5305,1.4316,1.8002,4.6421,6.1165,3.5815,0.6874,2.9484,1.3241,2.6094,7.062,0.4358,4.5343,5.2131,3.4598,2.1021,3.3391,0.5249,3.6999,5.7267,2.991,1.2063,1.184,1.8707,2.5988,4.0304,4.8473,3.1897,5.2921,5.9672,3.8413,1.1513,1.5268,1.4823,4.7669,1.5247,4.036,1.3423,4.8659,6.1475,4.836,0.7663,5.5409,3.8588,4.4204,2.4931,1.159,3.0557,4.6256,0.0014,0.0738,0.075,2.4371,1.991,1.537,3.1784,1.1799,6.7596,0.0245,0.0014,1.6326,2.889,1.6379,1.9368,3.6765,6.1882,0.8536,0.6841,1.019,0.8172,1.7477,3.3899,1.5922,5.1644,2.3782,0.7174,0.8084,1.9553,2.7229,0.1417,6.0491,4.6113,3.199,3.9242,1.1487,4.3454,1.4908,0.2786,0.1209,0.0809,2.0714,1.5225,3.0157,1.2421,0.2299,0.0609,0.0875,2.4933,1.3654,4.1356,2.0566,4.661,7.4447,2.7703,4.092,0.0429,1.4769,1.5021,3.8725,1.1399,1.5879,0.597,2.2597,0.9096,4.0311,5.6832,5.9338,3.5362,1.5722,1.3251,4.266,5.19,3.5899,0.9968,2.3082,1.3508,5.2873,1.1533,3.1458,0.7629,3.8295,1.1431,0.958,0.7459,0.3147,2.4412,3.8408,0.7104,0.1595,4.8409,3.3923,3.1722,1.4757,2.0719,1.5284,3.0004,4.5443,3.7098,5.0278,0.7474,1.1869,0.8963,2.7903,5.4715,6.5638,0.0826,0.9794,2.9398,1.7479,1.2686,0.7753,2.7328,0.0134,0.6068]}

{"id":539,"ended":false,"length":264,"text":"When the time came to begin You Only Live Twice, the producers were faced with the problem of a disenchanted star. Sean Connery had stated that he was tired of playing James Bond, and that the film had to go on. Not sure what kind of future James Bond would leave, but the film, while being a complete masterpiece, had also gotten out of hand.\n\nIn spite of the fact that Sean Connery had not been able to cast the film as a movie, he did leave it with one last chance to make it into a commercial. It came into production today, but because the film isn\u2019t on any screen right now, fans will have to wait for the premiere of the movie on Sunday, Nov. 27th, in Philadelphia and the premiere in January as well. If not, people can be assured that The Dark Knight Rises will come out again in theaters on Nov. 28th.\n\nOf course, the cast is not all in the same place and that is why most rumors surrounding both of those movies may have been exaggerated. That said, I would still love to see James Bond with a little bit of love, or at least some good old-fashioned blood. Whatever the case, you\u2019re going to have to wait for the premiere of James Bond Rises, which will be released in January in the United States.\n\nJames Bond Returns","token_len":284,"entropy":[2.5591,5.0692,2.0653,1.6108,4.842,12.3294,5.394,0.0607,0.1386,0.602,2.2857,4.3761,2.6736,5.4008,0.0114,1.3758,3.8273,0.1475,3.4126,8.0229,4.1628,0.0001,4.3335,1.7525,8.0632,2.34,0.0036,2.2294,7.6839,0.8458,0.7743,1.6269,4.1973,0.115,2.2446,5.2749,0.767,1.1524,0.8417,2.0683,2.744,3.9601,2.7139,1.4716,2.6844,3.3319,0.8066,5.9673,6.1773,1.5791,4.9844,0.0026,6.5896,2.641,0.0659,1.8524,6.6102,2.1045,2.79,2.636,3.7427,4.747,4.1737,3.7391,1.733,5.9759,4.8636,0.2553,2.4715,5.2629,5.7697,4.7455,0.2647,0.2636,0.4553,1.8402,0.0182,3.0886,5.2033,0.0069,1.3603,1.9819,0.0995,2.9647,0.0968,0.0008,1.4952,4.0488,1.8665,2.4432,0.0026,5.9581,2.1566,3.6534,2.6195,2.1059,4.0763,0.8668,1.6823,2.2516,6.1115,2.6831,3.0473,4.7537,3.2815,4.5147,0.7061,2.3463,1.8004,2.181,1.1508,4.0783,1.1118,3.0136,3.9814,5.873,1.8987,7.4321,1.177,3.7179,5.1978,2.2267,2.4046,6.1824,16.6083,7.6289,1.5663,4.1112,5.2145,4.9397,3.418,0.0036,0.2547,5.382,2.3481,0.7376,0.1002,0.1824,2.0367,1.2458,5.4215,1.1166,1.0265,2.2657,2.682,3.5386,0.6593,5.1481,0.0692,3.4121,1.8554,1.6211,3.5975,6.8606,4.5554,2.6976,2.977,4.556,5.9122,6.192,0.6645,0.2388,3.9584,4.5525,0.3717,6.1961,2.549,3.6707,2.7729,0.2315,4.2799,3.3958,0.1908,0.6781,0.0,0.5663,4.3706,0.7095,6.2888,1.8531,2.5369,1.0558,2.2125,0.0174,1.0883,0.1938,0.8094,0.6124,0.0002,6.1474,0.0521,0.1484,2.1579,4.6111,2.6111,2.4267,2.8338,3.7042,1.718,0.6995,2.2246,4.1183,3.1488,2.5165,1.7108,5.4066,6.5727,4.5057,6.9232,3.0534,2.4616,1.7473,5.1482,1.8899,1.028,3.8084,0.305,4.5562,0.8623,0.0154,3.3029,2.6213,3.8968,2.8022,0.1039,0.6205,3.7513,0.0427,5.4499,2.6559,3.8841,1.4685,0.3098,3.5921,2.1102,4.9794,1.4452,0.1324,1.6649,5.0066,2.3122,1.3123,0.0101,5.8632,0.8454,6.5862,1.4158,0.8204,0.383,3.6232,13.0742,1.1488,1.803,1.6489,0.0065,1.3739,0.1031,1.3195,1.8935,0.9032,1.5227,0.4856,3.4189,0.0088,6.5374,0.0051,2.906,2.5241,1.6301,0.8938,1.3278,2.2799,2.7525,3.435,1.2752,0.9147,0.0497,1.0134,0.8263,0.0002,4.8486,0.067,5.0473]}

{"id":4597,"ended":true,"length":265,"text":"Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their human needs, due to coercive or manipulative language that aims to induce fear, guilt, shame, etc. The main purpose of the book is to explore what constitutes a conflict between individuals and groups, and what might constitute an attempt to prevent such a conflict. The main objectives of the book are to:\n\nEnlighten people about the necessity of maintaining the rule of law in order not to be influenced by coercive actions.\n\nEstablish a good sense of ethics and ethics within conflict resolution and to explain how conflicts and conflicts of interest play a significant role in developing conflict resolution strategies.\n\nDiscuss how conflict resolution should be used as an effective tool that will improve the communication between parties.\n\nDiscuss the role of conflict resolution as an effective tool of conflict resolution as a tool that will reduce conflict and increase accountability.\n\nEncourage people to use conflict resolution more as an effective tool of conflict resolution, by communicating that conflicts can be prevented, both by maintaining the right relationships with individuals and groups.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo date, nonviolent communication has become an effective tool or tool for conflict resolution in conflict resolution and to improve the communication between parties. All the work being done in the past has focused on the use of communication, but we do wish to extend this to more areas. More areas would be appropriate as well.","token_len":285,"entropy":[10.3099,5.6497,11.7675,0.8776,5.6792,8.229,2.3327,2.3202,3.6739,0.341,4.7694,1.0476,5.7598,0.8108,4.9771,2.2552,6.3274,3.8773,1.5168,7.3658,0.1038,8.1854,2.0764,4.0016,6.4486,3.3466,6.7923,0.1133,7.2304,3.7569,1.345,3.6658,0.4269,2.4959,0.3761,5.3815,0.307,2.7288,4.8538,3.3187,0.0581,2.0474,4.1708,0.1917,0.0722,3.5454,3.4368,4.2011,1.307,2.2066,1.4045,1.5296,0.4876,0.3348,1.3683,0.8959,1.9186,4.1384,2.9303,2.0897,3.7736,0.2807,3.7976,2.4491,1.9007,0.0824,0.708,1.8724,3.2394,5.0061,0.2993,0.4926,0.0654,0.2526,0.5169,4.269,1.833,0.0007,4.8903,4.4439,0.0062,3.6848,3.8939,1.2534,6.3349,0.4737,4.6003,2.8043,6.1545,0.0599,0.072,2.4017,3.2992,5.5211,0.0169,1.9563,4.4933,0.1888,4.4759,5.5048,2.0472,0.528,0.0002,4.562,0.0196,1.3161,5.8494,3.9751,0.0955,5.4178,1.5658,3.6414,4.3839,4.4242,0.6637,2.3078,3.1059,6.8295,1.6632,2.8491,4.4463,1.458,2.583,1.126,5.8079,3.3115,3.5175,0.1253,0.051,5.609,3.801,0.1994,1.5238,0.338,0.1047,0.0003,5.0515,2.4479,1.0752,0.083,4.2932,0.5463,4.5086,2.1586,1.7531,1.385,1.5078,5.5974,2.911,4.1075,1.2662,7.5091,1.9348,4.1247,1.2444,0.1367,0.0003,3.4802,1.479,2.9765,0.191,1.174,0.0367,2.363,1.2812,0.6178,0.903,4.7207,3.2677,0.0724,4.498,1.0591,3.3745,2.4441,1.0638,2.7807,1.4247,1.5597,3.7498,5.3032,0.8628,0.131,0.0003,4.1813,0.0074,0.8021,0.1144,3.5593,0.5671,0.0178,4.7021,2.4341,1.3748,0.3594,0.6731,1.3087,0.4873,0.0075,2.8025,3.6886,5.93,2.7121,3.2991,2.9756,0.491,2.6795,1.7834,6.8949,1.6343,4.9808,1.3596,4.5519,6.7261,1.2058,2.8946,0.3541,1.0112,5.4484,0.2772,0.0003,4.7841,0.5672,0.0003,4.4934,2.8784,0.2007,7.1714,0.9107,0.538,2.8039,2.0928,2.2369,0.646,8.5656,1.7879,1.4203,2.4977,0.0126,2.1083,3.0887,0.2859,3.0288,3.5199,3.3883,0.9428,1.1359,0.1574,0.7402,0.3135,6.5585,2.9257,3.87,4.348,0.0604,1.8471,1.1902,4.9493,1.9134,1.8836,0.1301,1.7363,1.7963,0.0287,4.62,3.744,1.5985,3.3895,4.3842,7.1308,0.4539,4.6583,1.1964,3.2569,3.3719,2.8237,1.9019,5.1203,5.2968,4.2358,0.5952,6.0238,4.1434,1.7332,0.6298]}

Under the Crusaders, the city was destroyed in 1948. The first phase of the restoration work was carried out by the Haifa International Airport, which connected the city of Jerusalem with Gaza in 1949. As the world is now used mainly by Hamas rulers \u2013 including the Haifa governor \u2013 the Israeli government started building bridges between the two countries and the settlement system was finally established between the two sides in 1967.\n\nThe HIA became part of the Haifa International Terminal Park and was demolished in 1988 and replaced by the JERIM International Airport. The airport was built from the ground up as the largest city and was used for international flights. The International Hotel and Marina, its first tower in 1961, was opened at a scale of 25 meters above the sea during the construction period.\n\nAfter the Haifa High Commission in the United Arab Emirates completed its restoration in 2002, both buildings were reopened and were renovated to their original facilities. In 2005 the airport was given a facelift and a new structure, complete with modern amenities, was created. The new building was designed and built on a budget of around 1 billion dirhams (around $30 million). The new building was designed in collaboration with the Government of Israel.","token_len":286,"entropy":[8.0378,1.1249,9.2304,2.8854,11.0666,5.3069,3.7079,4.336,1.9027,4.3937,9.8017,4.2004,2.2443,5.8262,2.5168,10.6319,0.0928,0.8479,1.6369,7.1939,0.0828,2.6253,4.3401,5.2955,6.5301,2.7828,4.8091,1.128,2.2579,7.0729,4.6465,2.8709,3.6803,8.0734,1.0462,0.6371,9.6275,0.58,7.0683,0.9448,5.7854,0.0958,1.0049,1.4055,1.7637,0.9923,4.4702,2.2671,7.4695,1.5417,2.1478,4.8364,4.6147,0.1949,0.4574,5.1469,5.4947,1.6822,2.0773,0.05,1.3076,0.8047,5.5658,0.0087,5.5043,6.5446,1.5194,1.05,6.3299,0.9533,1.0733,3.8658,3.1048,0.4463,6.2522,2.3077,3.4528,0.4561,4.8945,1.9562,4.8066,6.0644,1.642,5.6934,5.3055,1.2814,7.0113,7.7556,6.5124,3.1717,1.4257,4.7268,0.0007,4.5945,2.4963,1.4221,5.2377,1.0914,6.2061,3.2288,6.1347,2.2285,0.8287,0.6455,2.0912,2.3082,2.5403,5.8203,4.8711,2.1882,4.7765,2.4597,4.369,2.6413,0.8393,2.663,0.9225,1.7581,0.1852,0.9602,0.0036,1.8189,6.5604,8.6819,5.6895,3.7148,0.0035,0.4677,3.5648,0.0006,0.9058,5.8426,6.7508,2.6306,2.1049,6.0121,0.6478,4.3311,2.5594,2.4602,0.4354,0.8725,6.0076,5.7934,5.5766,1.9458,1.4002,0.9558,1.3723,2.8443,1.1965,3.0209,3.4356,1.5042,0.7425,0.0326,2.624,2.6975,4.1335,5.1087,3.7465,1.8397,2.6324,1.6922,3.0752,0.6934,2.0461,1.4105,4.472,5.5299,2.1901,5.9297,2.7169,5.787,3.1789,4.9333,3.4306,6.394,0.2696,0.6086,3.4892,3.5778,2.911,7.2823,0.7764,4.3794,3.2878,5.0116,0.8567,3.7788,5.772,0.4409,3.4995,3.7179,0.6633,1.6295,0.0002,4.4413,0.696,4.8063,0.0002,7.3988,3.5908,2.6623,3.4753,6.1818,1.3532,0.016,5.1261,1.8376,4.0345,3.0193,3.5001,0.2221,6.9531,6.3852,0.3951,5.0186,1.6222,4.1929,3.3313,1.9297,4.1763,1.2188,6.8603,0.5986,2.6706,2.4799,1.9277,4.0818,0.5255,4.6338,1.5381,3.9116,0.0193,0.0037,1.1765,3.0352,0.7257,4.026,2.4434,5.1239,0.0173,4.8695,3.3816,1.3648,0.5681,4.6647,0.685,1.4504,1.9145,1.8868,1.7292,3.4297,2.9548,1.0793,2.7966,1.9684,6.3261,0.3242,3.6502,3.2972,2.6582,4.9946,0.014,0.4054,1.3268,1.9391,0.7778,4.2188,0.3433,1.0617,1.5526,1.6219,1.3994,1.6672,3.242,2.8343,2.7787,0.0155,0.6618,5.9489,0.1299,0.5628,2.0822]}

Three oxides are known : europium (G, P, and Te ), as they have all been discovered to be stable, or unstable stable compounds. S, Se, and Te have an attractive stable stable oxidation state.\n\nOxygen is an important part of the hydrolysis reaction; the carbonic acid molecules are converted to the cyclic aromatic and monocytogenetically aromatic hydrocarbon compounds.\n\nThe reaction is initiated if the hydrolysable carbon (or aromatic) compounds are present in the molecule. This is important for the formation of the oxygen, but the other phases present in the molecule and the chemical process of oxygen. The molecules to form are then separated by water in the presence of certain gases : hydrofluorocarbons (HFC).\n\nOxygen can be formed or dissolved in water by mixing several molecules in a water source. In order to form oxygen, the molecules in water need to be separated and dissolved in a solvent with a potential ionic charge, or ionic charge of the molecule.

Thus, British command was able to take advantage of the gap between them, allowing them to advance in as few battles as they were still within their lines.","token_len":287,"entropy":[7.1096,5.9475,2.1078,10.6668,0.1288,0.5315,5.6412,7.3708,0.0119,9.041,1.4278,6.1948,0.3987,4.9707,0.5445,5.0695,1.9621,7.2856,2.2059,0.497,9.9182,6.7034,2.0358,0.5691,5.6226,3.6213,5.2668,9.9662,1.5435,5.9196,8.7483,8.3882,4.4068,1.7848,5.6407,5.2551,2.6943,5.198,1.3636,10.2417,1.0718,2.4067,1.3225,2.3363,2.1156,2.4231,1.1099,1.0853,3.4089,4.6896,4.2327,4.5611,2.3724,3.4514,5.7536,3.2329,5.6482,5.1389,1.3044,2.6825,4.5564,0.0837,0.6144,0.5531,0.0129,3.8826,2.7296,0.7756,2.7826,3.5246,0.9162,0.1322,0.3931,3.6716,0.7551,4.0757,1.8958,4.1721,3.6476,1.0372,4.044,0.5024,5.3213,1.8921,1.3058,3.9268,0.383,1.5093,0.9907,3.7896,2.8065,0.2536,2.2038,1.2904,5.1196,0.002,0.2664,0.0012,0.2998,1.1233,3.5012,4.4753,1.0915,4.0439,4.1996,3.9741,5.7688,0.6724,0.1951,1.8468,4.3751,2.0315,1.9057,3.8084,0.0369,2.0508,2.3232,0.0033,10.9678,8.4549,5.9125,1.4221,2.684,1.8518,2.5892,2.2456,2.5562,4.2843,0.8114,3.2927,1.1156,4.4252,3.4779,2.85,1.6412,3.0758,2.2362,0.4642,3.7063,4.3942,5.5155,0.0259,4.7306,1.6344,2.8169,2.1802,1.1832,1.7508,0.7041,2.4756,2.0809,8.2658,3.8086,5.2407,2.7033,1.6731,1.5763,3.4611,3.2842,1.1225,1.9108,4.7793,5.132,3.6599,0.007,3.1312,0.9536,1.9617,0.5889,1.7648,1.7458,4.6536,2.04,5.2343,0.566,2.1769,0.8735,8.114,2.9805,6.555,0.477,3.2119,1.8723,3.5319,1.8276,1.9065,1.8494,0.0501,2.5442,2.6712,1.2774,0.0037,0.4951,0.2811,1.8887,0.3181,0.7807,3.0666,1.2444,0.1365,3.2584,5.4312,1.1764,3.1221,2.6261,0.0203,0.9094,3.954,0.1174,0.6671,2.4681,4.9871,1.3362,1.0993,1.045,1.1351,5.7091,4.7221,6.1111,0.9037,3.892,6.7961,0.2817,0.0007,6.3114,5.9025,2.8731,2.6991,0.0017,1.0615,0.8902,7.1641,0.036,4.5485,0.0073,3.2282,1.6503,5.5379,0.1707,2.4176,5.0943,1.6722,3.5644,6.9778,2.8594,2.2132,0.2281,1.0299,3.5338,0.9219,3.105,1.2508,0.3196,4.7119,0.7451,6.0604,0.7373,4.7614,4.478,2.5388,1.5885,0.0239,4.0925,2.3939,0.0063,0.3629,7.425,1.4304,3.8721,2.8232,3.4555,1.3996,0.0936,2.5214,3.266,5.3699,2.2888,6.2222,0.0261,2.4052,3.3981,6.9622,5.127,1.7688,2.3147,0.8055]}

These include an expansion on her background and early life in the book Night in the Pines, a new character development arc, and a much improved sequel to her story, Night in the Garden, which is a complete reworking of the first novel, Night in the Garden.\n\nThe New Generation arc is set in a different, new world than her main story, with the novel set in America and New York during the Second World War. There are a lot of changes, but nothing bad.\n\nIt makes sense that Ro makes a sequel to Twilight. I also like that the book is set in American history, that it is set in America and isn\u2019t as famous to read to as it really is. But I also think it makes Ro a better author considering she is the author of Twilight.\n\nOf course, Ro has faced obstacles, but the more the series is going in this direction, both of those happen right behind her.\n\nThe other book that I love is that of The Last Time I Ever Saw the Face or The New York Times best-seller and I also like that she is focusing on the New Era as a whole. That is one where everything is new, from characters to locations to stories.

What is the meaning of it?","token_len":288,"entropy":[8.1472,2.8056,6.3362,3.9411,3.8941,8.6936,2.5989,7.1919,10.113,4.5382,11.7984,4.9533,6.8429,3.0714,0.3664,0.5713,5.4256,3.0765,7.3033,12.8744,0.9848,10.9925,5.9415,7.364,5.4177,2.5968,1.7976,3.7817,5.9764,2.812,8.4718,7.2597,7.3331,0.5875,1.3779,8.0808,1.1975,1.525,7.3034,5.8113,2.2709,2.4739,4.6556,3.5404,5.564,1.4951,1.4538,0.2806,3.3979,1.6768,5.8953,1.2448,1.3415,0.0225,2.8131,4.4895,0.2719,0.9853,2.5501,3.7149,2.8175,2.9485,0.1905,0.3302,0.1896,0.0541,1.4189,0.9988,6.0678,5.3891,3.9859,6.813,0.9668,4.1551,0.6544,2.9108,5.7411,2.8768,2.3072,1.0422,2.8887,3.198,2.4486,5.4153,3.8314,1.4724,1.5113,6.0739,1.2121,0.7439,5.4843,6.7515,3.7456,3.7061,1.1912,0.3931,0.0936,0.8323,0.1548,0.5705,1.6413,0.9931,0.0738,1.2986,2.6177,1.8936,5.5621,4.5014,1.874,0.0018,1.4919,2.8819,1.2702,2.2905,0.3931,0.1162,0.1333,0.3908,0.1159,1.1442,2.1668,3.3319,1.1669,4.0435,0.438,0.5128,2.7728,0.7516,1.1045,0.1669,0.1793,4.1173,0.6508,0.0842,1.3111,2.2354,2.4761,0.0132,0.3797,3.4114,0.6756,6.1087,6.9423,2.5663,1.6216,0.9594,0.4446,6.5046,4.5388,2.0017,2.3979,2.5648,0.648,0.181,1.6754,0.4217,0.129,1.5918,0.284,2.6915,0.2803,0.1076,2.0656,0.1022,0.031,0.2971,0.1948,0.1169,2.3887,2.932,2.6017,1.2116,0.9734,5.0131,0.2532,1.2489,0.9749,3.8821,0.5116,0.7727,0.1141,0.1366,1.1308,0.2032,0.057,0.3779,6.2526,0.5164,0.8011,0.0003,5.666,0.9553,1.7925,2.8192,2.2135,0.873,1.7747,0.4132,6.6441,3.1281,1.1624,2.1793,4.2758,5.6419,2.0042,0.2418,0.0002,5.6655,5.1762,5.9457,2.1059,2.5749,3.2013,3.7976,2.2045,3.7875,2.7662,4.7425,3.1426,2.1827,3.1635,0.3609,1.0651,5.0324,4.9447,4.8922,0.0188,2.5482,2.9451,9.7294,4.9236,2.1872,1.8879,0.2274,0.9512,1.8519,3.6967,2.0854,2.8336,1.6647,1.1444,2.8193,3.0028,2.1302,3.3283,1.1919,3.3871,3.5102,1.6372,0.5446,0.7622,3.0248,1.1329,2.7535,2.0012,4.2478,0.3448,3.4488,3.0403,0.1126,0.1425,7.5035,0.4438,0.0002,4.3477,1.0316,6.0293,2.4482,0.9006,5.0399,0.9138,1.1222,1.7823,0.5042,0.4737,0.2133,1.8661,0.5156,0.012,0.2275,4.6896,1.886,0.8048,1.6527,0.1558,3.5891,0.8204]}

Pardons may eliminate crimes that are committed in the course of serving the law of a given state. Proposals to grant nolle prosequi have two main effects. firstly, states that give pardons and nolle prosequi can give new security to the people so that they not only keep the people from running away, but also help them to avoid the risk of their lives. Secondly, states that grant nolle prosequi have two consequences for citizens. They can put a stop to crimes that are committed by the public and thereby help them to avoid the risk of death. In light of this, states that grant nolle prosequi can also be used to help reduce poverty and increase health care delivery. Nolle prosequi has also proven to be effective in addressing the challenges associated with criminal justice in most areas. Furthermore, if there are crimes that are committed in violation of the laws of a given state then the law of a given state can be modified and then applied to the perpetrators themselves and to the state to help resolve the matter. To reduce crime rates, states grant nolle prosequi, allowing them to deal with crimes in a more efficient manner.","token_len":288,"entropy":[5.8798,8.4851,8.2178,5.931,0.0281,8.6961,3.6875,7.9727,1.3183,6.9552,1.3127,0.4526,0.8236,4.9619,0.0037,0.0088,0.7725,8.3287,1.6302,1.1831,3.3581,4.9983,4.3605,7.4522,2.0162,6.127,0.1306,2.8956,0.0025,1.6415,0.6113,2.1932,0.0146,7.5027,1.8363,0.9721,3.4624,0.1786,0.8713,1.8028,6.5677,0.5313,0.0093,4.3739,10.3586,3.9372,3.5078,1.5791,3.3321,1.9304,1.1157,1.7165,0.0074,6.232,0.9025,3.8012,3.3747,2.8107,3.7801,1.0926,1.2271,5.7499,1.2088,0.1351,1.5414,3.4284,3.7917,0.009,0.0088,0.0365,0.0026,0.0328,3.7009,4.6682,2.5982,3.3049,1.8679,5.8716,4.4282,0.2225,6.7334,2.4403,5.1732,1.4368,0.0016,3.8692,0.5864,0.0068,0.0077,0.0155,0.0002,0.0415,3.5658,4.0072,5.7317,7.399,0.4827,1.4339,3.6359,5.6407,0.4328,1.0866,6.0108,0.2133,5.0543,1.1504,2.315,2.4717,5.7158,1.2638,1.3712,0.1206,0.8841,4.1666,1.0017,1.3685,3.3643,2.2081,4.2499,0.1196,4.088,3.6084,2.2239,1.7638,0.0247,1.8022,0.4915,1.0407,1.6679,0.0027,0.001,0.002,0.0007,0.0153,2.4641,3.6997,4.5998,3.5244,4.6149,1.6732,2.5558,1.757,4.708,2.1941,1.2062,0.0127,2.1688,1.6563,0.9269,1.4702,1.7156,1.7501,3.4721,2.3786,4.7669,3.6714,2.0446,0.3943,0.6853,1.1455,0.7225,0.0506,3.1303,1.0046,2.5891,6.3308,0.0011,1.9468,0.5197,1.9609,0.4844,0.584,0.8848,0.0017,0.001,0.0014,0.0013,0.01,1.7659,1.9747,3.8201,1.5258,0.6526,3.276,4.1992,4.7177,1.1805,3.0738,3.9095,1.7198,5.3999,0.6872,5.0228,0.0968,0.0032,0.0482,0.0016,0.0447,4.1431,2.1217,5.0339,0.6898,0.2669,2.3432,0.5963,5.2477,1.7448,4.5442,4.3635,0.0026,3.8734,0.3476,2.2526,4.8104,4.3703,1.2704,6.0034,0.0186,5.6447,4.7104,1.2464,4.5611,1.1773,0.9125,1.3394,1.3843,4.0894,0.0135,0.7478,2.4994,0.2919,0.6663,0.7739,0.0988,4.7003,1.562,3.2499,1.1442,1.7857,1.0244,0.1187,1.2736,0.8718,3.6938,3.0844,5.5852,1.9475,0.7042,1.9099,5.7209,5.529,3.7523,1.7893,1.0117,3.2238,4.008,3.4546,4.7655,0.8178,5.089,0.3061,4.9708,5.4499,1.5019,3.3888,1.4558,1.0723,7.7663,0.5696,0.0014,0.0011,0.0027,0.0022,0.016,2.8316,5.3865,1.6405,0.0524,4.9346,0.2431,2.4902,2.6681,1.0692,0.7961,2.4618,0.6087,0.5433]}

Hooper spent most of his career directing action action stories in the United States and Australia, before moving to South Africa, filming the series as a series manager for the BBC's Westend Comedy Club and then the television show A Lot of Boys for BBC One. The series was adapted into a feature film by American filmmaker Steve Kerr, and released in April 2007 in the United States.\n\nThe documentary also featured interviews with the film's producer, director and one of its co-stars, producer Janae Stoller. The film was presented as the film by The Cinema Club on Wednesday 10 June 2007. The film premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. The project was a critical response to Hooper's earlier work as a director and film producer. Hooper also worked on the Netflix documentary Lost in Love ( 2004 ).\n\nHooper has spent a period of time editing all of his film. Hooper's previous work includes his short film with director and producer Jack Eiser and A Lot of Boys, which premiered at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival. His work in the documentary Losing in Love (2005) is a short, but still relevant and timely work which emphasizes the importance of the love story.","token_len":291,"entropy":[9.5945,6.2139,2.1021,2.6592,2.3127,0.6491,7.9287,1.0629,2.7032,3.0412,2.0934,7.2581,1.2232,11.8316,1.8907,0.1913,0.0006,0.0014,0.1064,9.2379,6.2828,8.0108,2.6484,12.2967,1.977,1.9237,5.23,7.107,0.0126,1.209,0.4168,1.2226,6.2112,0.9433,0.0361,0.0,0.0004,0.0,0.0,0.0001,1.3326,6.3658,12.1178,0.3776,0.5067,9.1055,0.0016,5.4453,3.203,0.0069,0.7196,0.7505,2.741,5.1764,4.467,5.9186,2.0627,1.4218,2.8191,0.1659,1.1731,3.3271,0.7291,3.9844,1.0436,0.3102,3.0981,0.5506,3.0993,6.4,2.3186,4.0202,3.856,0.7974,3.6863,8.549,1.3664,1.7927,2.4398,2.3466,5.9804,7.0416,9.3163,3.2736,2.3666,3.1079,4.3387,5.1648,2.3668,5.3179,6.7267,0.555,5.4436,4.5941,2.687,1.76,0.5925,3.3666,1.2799,1.6152,2.4009,0.6533,0.4739,2.9871,0.0736,2.039,5.2725,2.4327,4.7455,6.8714,1.2676,1.552,5.2888,0.5736,4.7761,2.4166,3.2122,0.9475,1.1357,0.3741,0.6823,1.5637,0.0025,2.9408,5.3498,4.4746,2.5929,3.0106,0.0569,2.4699,3.8699,0.1259,3.8348,0.6308,4.3249,0.7402,7.9479,1.4366,1.0622,2.3306,0.0071,0.994,0.2195,5.3113,6.2541,4.6166,4.7092,5.1582,5.3578,1.0215,2.0384,1.5223,1.2844,4.9959,1.8511,2.7471,3.3187,3.3215,4.1664,5.4995,3.8533,4.3564,4.676,5.4303,3.2022,2.6575,0.9085,2.0007,1.5479,3.4322,0.3748,0.4029,4.9178,4.1526,0.0001,0.024,0.0208,1.5325,2.3329,4.4967,0.9123,4.1456,3.8874,4.2882,0.0885,4.7709,0.0022,0.0427,5.9205,1.6979,2.5471,0.4283,2.1205,1.6694,5.5476,1.8382,1.3967,2.3127,0.0014,3.3416,3.1413,1.0505,1.1357,6.9688,2.2387,6.1292,1.1029,5.5353,1.5388,5.2425,2.0016,0.9805,0.0002,2.2541,0.0015,2.9996,5.5724,3.3581,6.4735,0.6764,0.4739,5.9386,6.1025,0.9204,0.871,3.2279,4.5727,4.5044,0.0036,1.8793,4.4542,1.5527,1.1186,4.002,3.6186,0.793,7.3088,4.9526,3.6579,1.5507,5.4736,5.1787,10.108,1.9877,5.8014,0.9333,0.0162,0.0456,2.1479,1.622,1.9382,0.2927,0.3772,3.2631,0.4382,0.0004,0.0207,0.0057,0.4487,2.9966,3.6579,3.4284,1.3653,3.1378,8.2262,1.3026,0.8555,0.0122,1.3881,3.4169,0.2566,2.9091,2.8635,3.2489,4.2734,4.7227,3.5591,5.8021,3.3946,4.6666,3.9445,3.8822,6.7917,0.6205,1.9231,0.0377,2.5207,4.4597,1.3296,2.3502]}
{"id":2766,"ended":false,"length":266,"text":"Currently, the objects with the highest known redshifts are galaxies and the objects producing gamma ray bursts. The most reliable redshifts are from spectroscopic data, and the highest confirmed spectroscopic redshift of the supernova, the explosion of the first supernova in a supernova explosion, is. Thus, such supernova, unlike the neutron stars that produce gamma rays, is one of the easiest targets for nuclear research. A lot of the studies focus on the origin of the supernova and its composition. For example, it is believed that the gas around the supernova is composed of gas and liquid like carbon dioxide, and that it contains some type of radioactive energy. On the other hand, it also contains some kind of radiation like oxygen, but the supernova is the opposite of that. In light of this, astronomers have been working for several years on the history of cosmic rays, a chemical that acts as a radioactive source. In addition to the scientific research that focused on the origin and evolution of the supernova and its composition, in addition to the use of lasers and other spectroscopic methods, the researchers have been conducting research that has also included the use of electric spectroscopic data for the study of the origin and evolution of supernovas and the effect they have on radiation and radioactive substances.\n\nThis project is supported by the European Space Agency and by the National Science Foundation (ESO).\n\n###","token_len":291,"entropy":[2.6708,1.9685,10.4575,5.2819,1.5255,2.3777,6.5128,7.9262,4.6101,0.4246,1.1552,8.6842,2.5555,2.3324,2.9865,10.989,8.8484,2.9566,1.0611,1.4645,2.0989,3.2799,6.3188,3.2881,0.0982,0.0706,0.6725,3.6969,8.7421,0.9888,0.3539,3.6487,1.7454,2.6006,1.5402,4.4375,6.7399,5.253,1.2413,0.03,1.4071,2.5215,4.2477,1.8816,5.7544,1.0033,3.5745,2.2002,6.1191,1.0225,1.1302,3.3168,0.8503,0.0366,1.9291,4.0127,3.0913,0.0957,1.5887,0.7881,1.4084,7.9437,5.1074,0.2074,5.9387,4.3208,1.0572,6.7817,6.2793,1.062,5.9275,1.4553,2.4872,3.5508,1.706,0.5187,0.2281,1.6257,4.7034,0.2967,0.0838,5.7703,3.1858,0.4499,5.1032,3.8871,0.3959,4.6957,5.2274,0.1277,2.151,5.1733,6.0064,0.0665,1.077,4.7895,0.2543,1.1075,1.9927,0.0495,1.7808,1.6425,6.2372,0.9993,3.766,0.9915,0.0335,3.3129,0.7659,3.0934,0.1047,0.6656,5.1209,4.9393,0.3745,1.2364,0.0156,1.8678,2.9743,0.1057,3.3877,2.7797,5.8219,6.6193,4.7111,2.396,1.4353,2.1968,1.052,1.8668,3.2305,3.7341,4.1454,0.0016,3.4537,5.756,0.5853,5.6753,0.2669,0.1832,0.025,0.0216,1.9305,3.6879,0.9753,2.0506,2.562,0.0007,3.8087,2.6286,4.7482,0.893,4.122,2.7457,6.0439,0.0627,1.5045,3.7874,7.2816,0.9209,2.0462,0.688,2.8728,5.1117,0.0053,1.0662,0.4975,5.0052,1.5034,2.1696,2.3821,1.7948,2.9324,0.6281,1.5747,1.0914,5.9746,0.1902,5.2788,0.3864,1.5712,4.7169,7.1138,3.463,5.6623,0.6297,0.3751,2.8123,3.5408,0.9909,2.649,2.6709,1.5242,1.3944,4.6406,2.607,2.3856,6.9515,0.0837,0.6896,0.2597,2.8317,1.8205,0.0106,1.0573,0.6043,0.0111,2.7844,0.9324,1.2542,0.1054,4.9983,2.4768,0.2395,0.751,6.1206,0.0264,5.614,1.2955,1.9433,4.8333,0.1067,0.192,2.5438,0.4292,1.5486,3.1583,1.4181,1.948,3.5298,2.468,3.9061,2.2062,3.561,2.1732,1.5683,2.1463,0.005,6.3049,5.0557,0.1578,2.1827,5.347,3.8004,1.9202,2.9372,0.0171,1.0144,1.6345,1.2032,0.2347,0.0098,2.1579,1.5902,1.9764,2.0787,1.7039,6.6938,3.5924,0.1089,0.1344,4.1278,2.4812,4.0603,3.7809,0.3454,1.5069,0.0061,4.0084,4.7628,1.4192,2.5926,0.0962,0.5493,2.975,1.3269,0.0045,1.7865,2.4467,0.3921,1.9627,0.6433,0.0069,2.2685,5.0452,2.1275,1.3561,1.0622,0.0002,5.7417]}

He was temporarily engulfed in flames on three different times \u2013 on the main stage, on the television, and in front of an audience, including a large number of fans on the ring floor. This also impacted the backstage security personnel during the match.\nA report by The Inquisitr mentioned that the Firefighter lost his arm and lost the ability to fire a bow, and that he was thrown from the match after he inadvertently hit the outside outside of the ring and onto the backstage railing of WrestleMania 36. On October 3, 2018, he was caught by an unidentified man on the street outside of the ring entrance in Philadelphia and was transported to a facility on the corner to assist him. The incident resulted in his ejection, but after that, the Firefighter was able to escape to the backstage ramp of the arena.\nHe was then taken to the U.S. Medical Center, where he served 18 months, due to his actions. The incident was reported to WrestleMania 33, where he ended up losing the belt. He returned to the ring, but later failed to recover his arm and was later hospitalized by paramedics as a result. He will be facing Mike Myers in the title clash at WrestleMania 32 in February 2020.\n[Featured Image by TASS\/iStock]","token_len":292,"entropy":[9.5312,0.0815,1.2979,6.8566,0.1804,0.935,6.7204,8.6438,0.2519,0.1482,8.1074,0.0465,1.7758,2.9213,1.1205,5.3154,4.2748,0.0636,3.0026,5.7487,0.1155,0.4763,12.1711,0.0707,0.0,2.1422,0.8496,3.0545,2.5727,6.093,1.9199,1.3827,2.1927,0.853,5.8181,8.5763,0.3142,0.3017,5.144,7.922,2.9077,7.2881,6.4485,3.3099,1.2869,6.3221,1.305,0.6907,1.9148,0.2825,4.5171,1.349,0.2954,1.274,3.3447,0.002,3.6917,0.2095,4.1164,3.5382,2.3879,2.8866,1.7294,0.0041,2.0838,4.4533,0.652,2.5785,1.0675,0.2326,3.9899,6.1657,5.2674,1.2592,4.8565,4.671,4.177,5.1497,0.4507,0.6385,0.7015,1.1482,10.638,5.1281,2.5041,2.1062,6.9384,0.003,0.0017,6.1995,0.4449,1.6234,5.2259,4.0494,5.438,1.5907,3.2557,1.6238,4.5986,3.1121,1.8859,0.0049,5.0218,1.8456,5.7458,3.0118,2.1759,0.9134,1.3801,0.9489,4.904,1.7585,0.3293,2.9178,3.507,2.199,6.1985,2.7649,1.507,6.3885,8.2224,0.7276,0.6572,1.5928,4.1555,5.5433,0.5086,4.1425,5.0698,3.9573,7.341,0.3361,5.6179,0.3772,5.2092,3.4464,3.4953,0.6058,5.4777,0.1729,3.9841,0.5784,5.2154,2.4694,3.2624,3.4515,2.0287,2.6259,0.6778,4.2337,2.571,0.933,0.8916,2.4597,3.8437,4.1003,5.7086,3.1674,1.5734,2.6797,0.0932,1.0995,5.8691,3.1285,1.1892,3.8485,6.2573,7.9017,3.7146,0.872,2.1417,2.5474,3.4653,0.0151,1.6503,4.8788,0.0094,3.2484,2.2901,4.9113,3.7249,0.8945,1.8649,1.736,0.0213,1.0228,1.8339,0.0064,5.1502,3.0111,1.6224,4.5971,5.7516,1.754,1.0912,3.0401,0.9934,0.7115,4.4271,1.0859,3.0516,2.485,0.3339,1.3017,4.9929,0.2376,0.067,0.0162,4.5538,0.2314,2.3573,0.2504,0.2204,6.7123,6.5892,0.9375,3.052,5.4101,0.0761,1.4391,6.3703,1.8033,2.4976,3.0876,1.6511,2.161,0.6596,7.1245,0.0548,3.9089,1.2378,1.7657,0.6095,6.3332,0.1845,3.5861,1.8162,3.8462,1.6412,2.0551,3.5909,0.1766,0.9127,1.1642,2.767,2.0955,5.4248,4.4637,0.2272,3.0569,2.6691,1.4275,1.5957,1.2897,3.4438,2.3277,3.5111,4.4928,4.7813,0.7828,0.172,0.8957,1.8767,5.1559,0.6749,4.8518,6.8522,4.5531,1.2343,1.1252,5.2133,5.3535,1.8988,0.2324,0.0376,1.994,2.3822,3.4941,4.995,0.2662,0.4104,4.7939,2.9537,0.0261,0.0967,5.6309,6.2932,2.853,4.241,0.0039,1.5062]}
{"id":4044,"ended":false,"length":265,"text":"The 411th Engineer Brigade was activated on 14 March 1949 at New York City. It was reorganized on 22 December 1950 as the 411th Engineer Aviation Brigade. A few years later, the 411th Engineer Aviation Brigade was established as the 411th Engineer Aviation Brigade.  The brigade, led by Deputy Leader, James Luttrell, was an experimental wing-based, low-flying aircraft designed mainly to replace the defunct 1-400 Thunderbirds. The squadron was primarily based in the New York area and the North Coast Coast. The squadron suffered from its early operational failures, as it was based in a wing and rear-end was heavily damaged in action. On October 3, 1956, only one wing had left the squadron. The squadron was ordered to retire from service on 1 June 1957.\n\nOn 17 October 1954, the squadron moved its headquarters in New York City to a military base at the site of the former Nuremberg Air Base, east of Manhattan.\n\nOn 8 August 1955, the squadron moved back in New York to a new facility in the northern part of the city. It was replaced with the New York Aviation Authority in 1957. The squadron, however, suffered heavy losses in the early and mid-1960s. At the same time, its fleet was still limited and the squadron lost approximately 25% of its flight capability. On 17 February 2007, the squadron was disbanded, with the squadron going through extensive maintenance.\n\nReferences","token_len":293,"entropy":[12.35,4.9456,6.4734,6.4218,2.7242,5.8052,1.5688,5.1312,2.7394,6.0268,3.3488,5.822,1.131,0.8896,1.9092,2.1764,0.8421,6.5244,0.941,2.8019,3.3619,3.4382,1.7269,2.4519,0.2772,2.95,0.0946,0.8381,8.7748,1.3707,0.6693,4.6014,4.5987,2.9061,0.0872,0.6291,1.0245,2.5654,0.0104,1.0168,0.778,0.3145,0.7566,3.8006,1.4138,0.4326,1.201,0.0356,0.7865,1.2621,0.9213,0.9853,8.3303,7.7667,7.177,3.8281,4.0474,0.0127,7.0461,6.8544,2.2225,4.9663,3.9518,7.4634,0.3722,0.2794,0.9893,4.6427,5.431,4.1793,3.2998,2.2328,2.9876,4.4961,0.3611,2.3608,2.4428,2.9583,5.7851,1.5729,3.3788,0.4079,7.6933,5.3288,3.5466,4.8204,9.2801,3.0904,0.7794,1.4328,4.108,0.9431,4.9894,2.1537,0.8477,2.39,3.9016,0.1619,1.0793,1.5192,3.8055,5.9157,5.0414,8.171,1.2298,1.4944,2.1807,5.7848,1.3919,5.2216,4.8797,4.1974,2.7839,1.6096,3.7234,1.6296,0.9549,6.1014,0.5593,3.5891,6.5274,5.469,5.8502,1.7268,2.2733,7.8671,5.6534,0.3796,2.8308,2.9574,0.8005,3.8741,7.0034,3.612,0.0965,3.7133,0.2196,6.7455,1.7806,3.2481,3.7939,5.1537,0.676,1.0168,1.2619,1.4253,2.0582,0.9096,4.0318,0.5888,3.7469,2.532,1.2654,1.2899,3.7653,2.9401,1.3482,0.5468,2.8979,0.0123,3.2557,3.7129,2.7354,3.6674,0.2041,0.5407,2.9821,4.821,4.0404,0.4475,3.9611,2.3715,0.1878,1.1395,0.3285,3.2979,4.5657,1.558,1.8608,3.4309,4.8794,0.0558,0.877,3.7049,5.0326,4.2603,0.0169,2.5563,2.0253,1.6634,6.0427,0.0129,1.9035,0.2328,2.9754,0.0003,1.2842,3.8332,3.1945,1.6448,0.1492,0.3364,1.6203,1.8458,4.0472,4.2412,1.9515,0.0151,2.6144,1.8718,3.5902,3.7219,2.1798,1.9169,4.9398,0.9684,0.001,0.8726,0.7689,0.4129,2.5849,0.8271,4.4855,2.7913,0.8106,4.7228,0.2688,2.9617,4.9776,3.1416,2.717,0.3253,1.4997,1.5529,4.0928,4.2483,0.0075,3.9595,4.8629,0.7911,1.5878,1.4091,2.4187,3.8735,0.5677,0.1588,1.2288,0.109,1.0237,4.6331,0.8745,3.2527,0.0074,0.1898,3.3272,5.1479,1.6,4.7337,3.8483,2.3824,2.0646,1.4481,4.5171,5.0338,3.969,2.6699,0.0304,0.0566,5.1516,5.0579,0.4631,3.0691,2.894,2.8578,6.5781,0.1451,0.3529,0.3347,1.3684,3.9096,2.6913,2.8656,0.8866,2.7691,4.5477,4.3846,4.7482,3.457,1.558,0.8924,0.0002,5.3751]}

But this is a big chance for the Tigers to prove that they can win games at an early stage, as they have done at home before, at Old Trafford, at least once.","token_len":299,"entropy":[8.7805,2.9379,3.3844,1.1857,1.2316,2.768,8.5556,2.4335,4.8741,1.8668,0.4554,0.9655,10.4609,2.1544,0.816,8.0868,14.3643,8.2539,6.3665,10.046,14.296,2.5414,8.63,3.6187,3.8378,2.4179,4.0371,9.7292,0.3623,9.2966,15.62,1.389,1.7566,0.0653,1.7092,0.7205,4.8405,0.0269,0.029,3.3678,3.1028,1.7084,4.9781,5.4667,0.2601,5.7105,1.368,0.071,0.8209,0.0869,1.0701,5.4811,2.7877,4.3822,2.2994,2.8059,1.1717,2.5434,6.5244,2.1863,7.2227,3.5876,2.6114,1.0925,10.3283,3.4477,6.2258,7.1097,5.0958,4.1539,0.412,5.2964,0.6919,0.113,4.4403,2.217,5.5138,3.7695,5.727,5.9942,0.8347,2.3046,2.6956,4.2032,3.1625,4.34,0.1063,3.9277,0.2434,0.114,1.9866,3.9493,0.0206,5.0128,1.1309,4.5709,2.8348,8.2496,1.7456,1.857,0.5206,3.5056,2.5498,6.4782,1.9018,1.6526,1.271,17.2322,0.035,6.0001,1.2047,0.3401,2.0979,0.0898,4.34,0.0082,0.0053,1.3279,6.7271,0.3454,0.9726,5.4482,6.8927,0.6552,6.8936,0.6736,2.3535,4.3678,6.339,8.5431,2.1249,6.1581,5.2152,0.0003,1.9102,3.6669,6.1489,2.9882,5.9851,10.317,4.6061,0.6929,5.4543,5.3912,0.0196,0.4788,5.2637,0.015,0.129,1.1489,2.2305,2.3291,5.8213,1.1134,1.5927,4.4304,4.979,5.1694,0.0734,5.2738,1.0489,3.9873,0.8461,1.5359,5.2909,4.3604,1.7876,1.304,0.3987,3.1416,0.0612,4.7431,1.5635,1.8604,3.4787,5.8354,1.3829,4.8135,4.3352,1.8211,0.5718,0.4365,3.5963,3.0801,1.8066,1.5626,2.3665,1.56,7.1929,2.2751,3.8351,0.6715,1.2115,5.9942,1.3107,0.3154,1.5187,0.0025,1.5706,4.4667,3.9405,3.6547,2.7137,3.4344,2.4453,1.0559,4.8576,3.4557,2.9026,4.278,4.0967,3.0414,4.6643,2.2925,6.3149,1.8611,4.2939,3.4671,1.2472,0.8582,6.0358,2.9486,3.3764,1.1652,2.5331,0.91,0.7655,2.5128,1.793,0.0566,1.5476,0.1908,1.7699,0.6924,6.0191,1.8436,4.6652,4.8113,2.0967,1.8248,2.6932,4.8624,0.0774,1.2641,1.3134,1.9286,1.5989,3.5254,2.5998,4.14,5.6585,1.084,2.1657,2.83,1.7622,2.1008,4.0392,4.5781,2.7835,5.2122,2.2169,4.0921,3.5659,1.4496,1.7794,3.2148,4.2129,0.2458,1.0333,0.2412,0.5534,3.0951,1.3613,0.2011,1.0333,2.5713,2.8516,2.034,5.363,1.1846,0.8313,1.7162,2.6411,0.5497,1.8693,2.112,3.0011,1.2931,3.0433,1.8617,4.0043,4.9426,0.074,1.4066,1.3286,7.1375,2.3415,1.5222]}

Among the new features were an increased tower, a new battery, new cannons, additional battleship guns, a new submarine, and special forces gear such as the 4th Fleet. Today these new ships are designed to compete with major oceanographic and land surveying fleets \u2013 including the British Seamanship, Seamen\u2019s Corps, the American Geographic Survey, and the Royal Maritime Institute (RMI).\n\nThe Royal Navy has received a significant and extensive new boost to its fleet in recent years. In 2017, the Royal Navy launched the U.K.\u2019s first unmanned drone aircraft, and has begun the development of a new submarine to match those of the United States Navy. The U.K. Navy received the U.S. Defence Secretary Jack Straw\u2019s guidance on drones, and is currently studying an all-electric and autonomous unmanned plane in service.

The Soyuz spacecraft was developed to provide the flight management and safety technology, allowing flight management of Soyuz spacecraft which will be deployed in an attempt to return the astronauts to the Earth.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App","token_len":300,"entropy":[2.0517,1.3181,8.1047,1.5749,0.0063,2.4226,11.8796,4.6488,0.5817,3.9068,3.5349,0.0077,7.2421,7.1927,2.1207,8.6181,2.2965,5.5765,1.8965,1.8409,1.4662,6.353,1.3,2.6353,2.8231,4.1642,1.9914,3.2204,0.1015,1.5557,1.4594,0.3726,2.3855,3.7194,1.5755,6.5023,0.0056,0.7495,4.4863,0.7437,0.294,1.9413,5.1742,3.6055,5.1495,1.6277,3.5344,1.9922,0.8566,2.8952,1.0177,5.5326,1.7326,6.0701,0.0031,1.5348,0.8332,1.3804,1.61,5.7484,6.4807,3.2574,2.9008,1.3625,0.0006,0.7755,4.295,6.147,2.548,7.4138,1.4071,1.5212,1.8896,2.7874,5.561,1.3055,4.4303,0.115,3.5532,6.7645,0.0481,0.6384,0.0454,0.0314,2.2622,2.9276,3.8532,0.3576,0.973,2.9024,0.3203,0.5366,4.4867,1.1093,1.3667,0.7654,0.0018,3.2259,2.1071,1.0449,1.2283,1.3104,5.5115,6.4369,4.3584,5.8265,1.6771,0.7365,0.1322,3.3319,2.5239,2.4834,4.7718,0.3918,5.1313,0.6637,3.8071,0.1879,3.2882,0.3755,7.8947,0.1912,5.6541,1.6186,1.0589,5.4504,3.6002,1.0862,3.537,1.4019,2.6675,4.4943,2.249,0.0009,0.8861,3.7243,2.5415,2.361,0.0578,1.3804,1.7762,0.6108,5.4621,0.4617,1.5696,3.1647,0.4184,1.0318,0.6809,2.7938,1.2357,6.8005,0.4176,4.8716,0.8431,0.7642,1.8423,1.452,5.3566,1.5094,6.2848,6.2603,0.9981,0.6943,4.2114,0.8994,0.6444,2.9191,1.1533,0.5112,0.0002,5.0714,0.1556,0.0003,4.0486,0.0001,3.1577,0.0024,3.9692,3.1404,4.6828,1.914,2.6332,0.3476,0.2706,0.8547,4.497,5.1704,1.7526,1.0176,1.7807,0.0328,3.0723,3.794,2.6817,0.3417,2.1202,1.0506,4.0155,2.0249,0.1622,0.555,0.3614,0.3952,4.5238,7.4798,0.5722,3.6387,0.9822,1.3553,5.1144,2.8817,0.6736,0.7357,1.9372,0.1775,1.2873,0.8219,1.5126,3.4241,1.0686,0.7304,3.8664,0.6353,4.7883,0.8324,2.0591,3.9347,4.8149,2.4509,0.0097,2.9817,2.7834,1.9173,0.7011,0.0004,0.6324,3.6076,0.5012,5.6902,7.7171,4.3955,4.0742,4.2929,0.9292,1.7721,2.0929,1.3519,0.6142,2.0527,1.7694,0.0001,1.0773,2.7307,4.0639,2.7354,2.6656,1.9818,6.1125,5.349,1.5541,4.2668,5.0842,3.6735,6.0684,7.2814,4.9411,1.5867,3.8487,0.0011,0.7595,4.7518,2.2159,1.1094,3.9245,1.6724,3.6816,2.7556,0.0293,2.2801,1.2976,0.6475,0.3625,2.2276,2.4974,1.0901,0.5778,0.0001,5.1946,2.7363,0.0456,0.0011,1.9441,0.0004,0.0,0.0,0.0014,0.0,0.0]}

English was often regarded as a highly literate native tongue as its native languages were only 20% of the native languages - there was no formal language school until the 19th century. \"Irish\" is now the Irish word used by Irish people worldwide for the first half of the 20th century, English is a French word meaning \"troublesome\" or \"depraved\", \"disappointed with something\", \"shocked at something\", and \"furious\". \"Honey\", in the United States is a type of French word meaning \"discomfort\".

The low @ - @ pressure area later became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical storm at 0000 UTC, and then became the eighth-most powerful tropical storm in the history of the hurricane season, the Atlantic National Hurricane Center reported on Aug. 22. This storm also formed out of the Atlantic Ocean on Aug. 27, when another tropical storm had formed west-west across the Atlantic Ocean. The named system has maximum sustained winds of 110 mph, and the Atlantic hurricane center said tropical storm activity is believed to be above normal and could be active once again. That means that the high pressure area is now only 0.5 percent (0.1 percent of the total area where strong winds and cold weather have caused hurricanes). The strong to widespread tropical storm activity has resulted in at least 21 tropical storm conditions in recent days. Tropical storm surge during heavy rains prompted numerous islanders to evacuate their homes in Puerto Rico on Saturday (Aug. 24). It was also reported that winds of 110 mph have been reported in the Bahamas. Tropical storm activity has also prompted widespread evacuations in Puerto Rico and Guam, prompting Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 to issue an emergency declaration. In addition, Tropical Storm Maria, located near the northern tip of Puerto Rico on Aug. 3, is approaching Hurricane Maria as well.

Theirs quickly became an overnight trend as customers were eagerly waiting to buy the items on their menu.\n\nLater on, as they expanded their restaurant business, they added other businesses and opened a third in nearby Dunedin, offering a \"bar hopping\" atmosphere for travellers to enjoy.\n\nSperry is the mother of three sons in North Queensland Queensland, NSW, and the wife of New Zealander John Edward Walpole.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nWalpole's Restaurant official website\nSperry's Restaurant Official Website\nWalpole and Mildred Walpole Official History\nWalpole and Mildred Walpole Official Statistics Official Website\nWalpole and Mildred Walpole Official Statistics\nWalpole and Mildred Walpole Official History\nWalpole and Mildred Walpole Official Information Website","token_len":302,"entropy":[10.712,3.996,4.0948,0.5995,6.9064,0.8694,0.1056,0.0032,0.8265,4.5208,2.7085,0.6892,1.8624,0.5076,4.6549,2.4323,5.4187,13.6124,6.0895,0.0012,1.8965,1.7189,0.5203,1.6418,6.351,0.0241,6.9401,2.329,9.3124,0.3989,6.7509,4.7937,4.3807,9.6644,4.0711,2.9558,6.1687,0.7944,6.3363,1.3297,2.3141,1.8486,6.4598,0.0011,2.5643,1.1052,0.6923,1.9967,0.0011,3.604,3.8741,4.2363,4.0742,6.319,0.0521,0.898,3.7946,2.5906,1.3746,4.5825,1.9265,2.2643,6.7265,4.363,2.3458,3.0611,5.0302,3.6317,0.2362,2.7547,0.7155,3.3827,5.3836,0.4745,4.1659,0.5653,4.9356,0.001,4.057,6.4927,2.9403,0.2682,1.0686,4.4681,0.1814,6.6108,4.8415,0.089,4.2748,4.9769,0.0114,0.8815,1.5802,4.8939,2.4078,2.2805,2.6664,5.8665,3.0046,0.8515,4.9248,0.2686,1.167,5.5676,5.0653,2.0679,3.5179,1.1129,3.3868,0.0503,1.1388,7.5888,4.2639,3.276,4.3691,0.9276,5.9082,0.961,1.9503,0.0297,2.9966,7.8878,0.2296,3.6344,2.2538,0.0059,6.1453,0.0081,5.7467,6.4101,1.9327,4.4424,4.5595,1.7063,5.5096,0.08,1.3805,4.8841,3.6809,3.4044,8.6346,6.7557,0.4926,2.8967,5.3344,7.2067,3.7829,4.4816,3.3839,5.9471,1.598,1.5731,2.962,3.5855,4.1722,2.8098,2.3524,3.4614,0.5442,2.3399,0.0002,5.8945,2.3343,1.0121,3.1329,3.463,2.6739,0.8979,3.911,1.6365,0.82,1.5662,4.3476,3.7943,4.1058,2.425,3.4539,1.6426,4.7329,2.6739,6.1644,4.8964,0.1306,1.2584,7.9973,1.8675,5.2691,5.6311,10.3635,0.354,3.6383,3.3428,6.2703,2.3164,1.7756,1.5942,0.9876,0.0002,2.2039,0.2296,0.0033,4.7722,3.2205,6.4649,0.1331,1.5811,2.71,5.1553,6.3989,4.1071,8.4935,1.2205,7.7922,1.0011,1.0599,2.7237,4.1328,0.0359,5.5699,2.5652,0.0015,3.0064,6.8521,1.8063,0.0076,0.7276,1.2685,0.0002,4.7531,0.9757,0.0003,6.0112,0.8167,0.8266,25.0562,0.0106,1.3878,0.2328,10.4945,0.4029,1.6372,16.5154,0.2892,0.0054,0.4257,0.4254,3.4233,0.9825,1.1492,20.8708,0.0062,6.1186,1.3761,0.0027,0.658,0.0144,2.8531,6.6273,1.1929,14.7977,0.0128,0.9784,0.0734,0.0042,0.2873,0.0011,1.4961,7.0516,5.3185,1.4915,0.5757,10.5627,0.0098,0.5953,0.0304,0.0031,0.1374,0.0006,0.5456,2.9355,2.7357,7.4176,0.0073,0.319,0.0245,0.0033,0.0712,0.0004,0.2455,2.2815,0.893,9.7309,0.0055,0.2175,0.0161,0.0035,0.0354,0.0003,0.1238,4.8125,3.3509]}

An architectural competition was planned for January 1991. Political turmoil in the Balkans took center stage in the next summer. Although the first democratic elections were held in July, the general elections were held in September, a year after the first democratic elections in Yugoslavia.\n\nAfter the first democratic elections in 1991, the local government did not recognize the new democratic status. The Yugoslav government adopted a state name, and in October 1991, the local government decided to declare that the municipality would be named after the president of Yugoslavia.\n\nAfter the elections, the newly established municipalities were also allowed to increase their own municipal size. The municipal government increased the total number of municipal buildings to more than 11.5 thousand inhabitants. After the general elections, in April 1971, the public schools merged into the municipality. Only a few towns remained in the municipality, but the municipality remained in the province.\n\nIt is not known when or if both municipal administrations will return to their current positions in 1990. For example, the municipal government should have declared in July 1990 that the municipality should recognize its new state name, and in July 1991, the municipality should declare that the municipality should have been renamed to the municipality. However, the municipality is not obliged to declare in January 1991, because the municipality still had not declared the name. If it did take place, the municipality will not be able to recognize the new state name.","token_len":302,"entropy":[2.6862,8.829,0.2774,5.064,0.232,4.3596,1.8342,3.5909,8.0581,0.656,0.8758,7.0009,0.3278,1.3366,9.5363,1.7105,5.8097,3.9545,1.2813,6.0415,1.1046,5.3409,6.751,5.3565,1.0423,7.6401,1.4251,5.4789,1.6764,1.5063,8.0569,5.4315,3.0037,1.3475,5.1895,4.7016,4.6352,0.0036,1.6311,1.3915,4.7733,5.89,1.1116,5.6106,0.971,4.3113,3.9934,0.2075,0.8251,0.1512,0.4066,4.8099,2.8368,1.2583,5.4832,1.1721,1.1525,0.2689,0.7418,1.8351,2.4516,4.6679,1.3942,1.1079,0.2626,1.8594,1.5255,0.1561,1.2594,1.8416,0.1536,1.6691,0.0028,3.4415,0.6397,1.9612,1.1755,0.0666,0.6244,2.7329,0.0976,0.9154,3.8578,0.6073,5.1039,0.0964,3.9313,0.4856,3.3391,4.2225,6.2741,1.7019,1.5085,5.4571,1.8749,4.6175,0.8536,6.1533,7.5505,1.4951,3.2648,2.7743,2.8979,1.3062,0.7325,0.9641,3.0369,0.529,3.9011,0.2441,3.8137,3.0765,1.237,4.3251,1.9935,1.2888,3.6032,0.7584,0.6893,3.2833,0.6567,2.2753,0.6858,2.0687,0.0002,3.0081,0.5516,3.0793,0.5942,0.6512,5.0106,2.5722,4.0631,2.0891,5.1815,4.4068,0.0604,6.3181,0.4594,3.5358,2.5878,2.9403,0.7055,1.6385,3.2872,1.2848,4.8981,1.2582,4.0375,0.915,0.0071,1.9679,1.3819,2.1757,3.8115,0.005,4.8133,3.6535,1.5479,3.5141,7.0381,0.6324,4.4124,0.4723,4.4889,0.1483,0.8221,3.8438,2.896,10.7809,0.1107,0.4525,5.8925,5.4308,7.3921,1.8373,0.8431,2.7248,1.0893,6.227,2.6999,0.9968,4.7791,2.8677,1.3186,0.494,0.7914,1.2706,1.9505,1.3293,2.6197,3.4645,1.8015,1.2985,6.1291,1.979,0.9638,0.0001,5.6993,1.0077,2.6939,1.8403,3.2318,2.5669,1.8947,6.8865,3.4176,4.1608,3.8496,3.7769,0.0939,1.9277,4.7227,2.8724,2.3377,5.2225,0.2815,4.8584,2.6305,0.0052,1.5516,3.183,0.6804,5.2342,3.3066,4.7217,2.5778,4.1163,2.3908,0.1408,1.0933,1.44,3.4523,5.8411,3.1729,1.4197,3.4075,0.4766,1.4084,1.4497,1.441,2.4162,0.6629,0.8741,0.8561,1.5709,0.7495,1.6879,0.6581,0.9471,0.7242,1.7377,3.4294,3.4042,1.5374,3.3102,1.0494,3.63,1.9907,2.5222,0.0042,1.3173,1.6846,3.4101,1.3767,4.1814,0.0298,2.4347,3.719,3.6381,0.6055,3.1967,2.77,1.0254,2.5306,4.0657,2.7458,4.2115,1.5418,1.4266,3.1897,1.2627,4.7314,2.8654,1.8152,6.3169,3.8967,0.5029,0.7909,0.6675,3.646,2.6694,0.7936,1.1382,0.0039,3.9864,0.4149,0.3225,0.5657,0.0708,0.6611]}

The world was being split up, and while the majority of the world had been defeated by the allied forces, only a handful of nations had achieved their true aims of destroying the empire. For the world not to be wiped out by the destruction, one of the countries that the world would not have fought as far back today, was Israel and the war in that country had not brought any great suffering to the Arabs themselves.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, the Middle East had the opposite effect because the war in Iraq and Afghanistan hadn\u2019t even begun yet. The Middle East was a conflict with a lot of problems. The Arabs got away from the world. The Arabs also got away from war because they were able to avoid that conflicts in the North, and where they really were, all of their problems were solved by the Arabs.\n\n\"So the long run is where the Middle East had some great challenges for the Arab and Asian peoples. So where you\u2019re going, it would be like how much better you were living in the United States than you were living in the Middle East.

Most burns ( 70%) have been treated in the US itself. Although, most of the injuries have been reported, the exact numbers are likely to vary depending on where you are. It is important to note that the only way of knowing the % burns involved in these incidents is to visit the American National Health Card Board, the American Public Health Organization, and other experts. More reports are provided here.\n\nThe largest death toll reported to the American National Health Card Board is one due to a high percentage of injuries from burns. A staggering number (more than 1,500) have had burns in their homes. In one burn in 2008, nearly 700 firefighters died after a fire burned their homes out and burned a third of their homes. In the whole incident, the National Center for burns also reported that there were many reports of burns on homes that were in flames or were burned down by natural gas fired in addition to the use of hot gas cylinders.\n\nThis number of deaths has led to the creation or enhancement of an annual national burn report and to the creation of an annual statewide burn report. It is also worth noting that the percentage of burned burns in the United States is actually below where it was five years ago. When burned out, burns tend to last at least 25 years. Many of these burn fatalities are as far back as 2000.","token_len":302,"entropy":[8.8556,4.1691,12.7328,7.1084,3.2835,12.0098,10.8999,7.0024,10.1462,2.4257,1.5334,10.9697,2.3447,2.499,2.727,0.0959,1.283,5.2096,10.1522,0.6918,3.7837,3.4884,7.3497,1.5767,1.3964,6.473,3.05,2.6255,4.9296,0.8826,4.6173,4.5434,5.4453,8.7553,2.4269,3.9678,0.7131,3.2174,2.8123,1.7425,4.6983,8.7744,0.5849,6.2037,4.1365,3.7409,1.6322,1.0421,2.1813,2.5667,0.424,3.1866,5.6339,2.2051,4.9354,2.9,0.761,4.7472,1.0328,1.1157,2.9785,0.1035,2.768,1.1676,2.0875,1.0777,4.3851,0.5659,1.7593,0.1267,0.9287,0.1877,2.1506,5.7485,2.0861,3.6128,1.4486,1.4514,7.8876,4.7253,6.161,1.045,3.8592,2.5529,0.2757,0.8555,3.7526,0.9853,4.2859,5.9822,4.5008,10.59,7.4381,2.5336,2.8348,3.4893,5.706,0.0393,4.4504,0.7373,1.5726,2.4579,4.9121,0.7292,5.8337,7.2727,1.8828,4.8581,2.6772,0.6265,0.9021,0.0026,2.916,5.7267,6.1043,0.36,3.6417,2.8115,0.7249,1.8527,3.2967,0.1528,0.6063,0.0536,1.8864,5.5653,6.8986,0.0257,1.1348,5.6455,3.3667,0.1675,3.7983,3.4624,4.3731,2.1131,3.5145,5.9437,3.6802,5.2499,4.667,0.0272,2.3923,0.4569,2.0084,0.3694,2.2693,4.3542,2.0999,3.0408,0.245,5.8751,1.5497,3.0069,4.4498,7.4333,3.1737,4.8801,0.3658,4.0564,5.0014,4.9512,2.8068,3.8324,1.8498,1.5707,4.1507,2.2387,2.3159,4.7424,3.2868,2.8406,2.9085,3.7771,0.3018,1.0873,1.8923,0.6485,2.0369,2.5048,6.6548,6.0794,0.2513,2.1327,4.9196,2.7311,0.0513,9.6356,5.3217,0.7064,1.6784,3.7428,0.4834,4.833,4.0927,0.1783,2.0081,2.9853,3.099,2.934,1.0232,3.727,3.4949,3.9052,2.7487,4.1555,3.1837,2.3915,5.0719,3.4262,5.3467,3.6496,8.1199,0.0323,1.8468,6.8174,0.0109,5.4622,3.7022,5.7697,0.7004,1.2439,0.0002,4.2732,4.1847,2.0215,1.395,2.9906,2.9733,0.8087,1.7621,3.4987,8.3712,6.1846,0.0406,3.0185,3.9778,4.3124,1.8107,4.7989,3.7637,3.4387,1.2616,1.8661,0.276,2.3158,1.9065,5.4017,1.3379,1.9134,0.7386,3.7615,0.3939,3.2334,5.3868,0.2062,0.0715,1.5835,4.8193,0.209,3.8224,5.5138,2.0412,0.8512,0.8931,0.0019,1.134,4.7064,4.8573,3.664,0.321,0.6068,4.195,0.1325,0.0777,0.4381,5.3393,4.0677,3.2844,0.6076,4.0779,4.0352,0.012,3.0672,4.3898,0.2147,4.9177,1.4582,1.0121,5.3,1.4462,0.8615,1.8207,4.555,1.0983,6.2382,5.0901,0.9044,0.0227,3.9266,0.9287]}

During the 1948 Arab \u2013 Israeli War, the neighborhoods in Haifa became known as \"the ghetto\" (Briva's Village \"Ha-Arsh\"), and the ghetto of Talma.\nIt was in Haifa, the largest Jewish settlement in the country, that Jewish immigrants arrived in Israel. Haifa had the largest number of Jews on the street at the time, and the Jewish population grew from 10,400 in 1948 to 1.1 million by 1966 and 6.2 million by 1970.\nAccording to the Haifa Times, Haifa's Jewish population grew from 300,000 to 449,000 in 1967 and was a major cultural center. With the construction of a new Jewish town called Haifa on the east coast of Israel, the population was further expanded to 449,500 in 1963 and was growing faster than the total population of the country that year. It was also one of the first towns in Israel to be known as the \"Seth Lomar\" (the Holy City\") because of its large Jewish population.\nThe first Jewish town to be established in Haifa was founded the following year in 1922, named after the town where Lomar lived, and was named in honor of the town's founders. It has an estimated population of 3.3 million, although the actual population is estimated to be as high as 3 million.","token_len":303,"entropy":[2.3183,9.4723,0.4846,5.7057,7.1912,0.1889,0.5304,2.3168,0.5129,1.18,3.1151,4.6442,3.0038,1.0081,10.6433,1.0055,3.6646,0.7606,7.9359,1.9661,3.6475,2.0386,1.8714,1.5927,0.6122,4.5634,0.4896,2.7907,3.1141,8.7606,1.7701,2.0013,1.3353,1.6684,9.9205,2.6965,1.5253,0.0001,2.2184,3.4855,0.084,1.417,2.0389,4.7915,1.7639,2.4154,4.8606,6.4486,6.1781,3.8432,5.4117,7.1802,4.8243,5.8245,4.8153,4.7634,3.3348,1.695,1.4229,4.481,3.7329,6.181,7.7917,4.8744,1.859,8.9974,0.7765,2.3446,3.3127,0.001,2.7299,2.7862,4.8299,1.8005,1.3487,0.3418,0.4835,2.2747,0.1566,0.209,3.4822,1.6948,2.3566,2.154,4.494,0.9054,4.9739,0.0026,3.2296,3.1178,1.5796,2.3319,0.0065,1.0748,4.2839,0.6971,4.8018,3.2833,1.0434,0.3246,1.5688,1.2821,1.8184,3.2001,1.046,3.3651,2.1766,3.9533,0.2501,4.4991,0.9551,0.6064,0.1497,3.6754,0.9677,2.8014,0.0413,1.2006,5.5955,4.2637,4.5067,1.1643,2.1953,0.0553,0.5516,2.5748,0.2683,1.4516,4.2749,0.0037,1.1556,4.5419,0.0327,3.7629,0.6574,3.1703,0.0044,1.7354,1.6606,0.2577,1.69,0.8671,5.4084,0.0465,0.0201,1.6716,2.9372,5.6098,0.0006,0.1136,1.4205,1.3915,1.643,4.1868,4.6099,1.9344,7.0425,1.7972,2.235,6.0403,0.9258,4.2325,0.0401,2.7168,1.7683,1.7391,4.6228,3.4987,2.6535,0.1301,3.4419,1.9652,4.5507,2.6863,0.6048,1.4006,0.5678,1.0958,2.2723,3.1223,4.4007,2.3015,1.2897,3.1181,3.863,0.0012,4.8868,1.3116,7.5702,1.2128,3.0991,4.6612,5.5056,0.2344,1.2732,3.6514,0.7493,0.6291,1.135,2.1195,6.7865,0.1206,0.3098,4.4845,0.6967,2.2496,3.4346,0.0041,0.1261,1.8072,2.7665,0.8708,1.1785,0.2568,2.069,4.9739,0.2149,1.4371,0.9913,5.0583,6.4125,5.7774,1.8065,4.5759,1.7478,1.1127,2.1918,5.4354,1.4259,7.1335,3.55,0.6186,0.6244,3.0367,0.5698,0.2359,0.3806,0.4242,1.6302,3.6396,1.4662,4.0723,1.585,0.4286,2.5105,0.7019,2.0282,0.0023,0.3797,3.7115,5.5669,2.9791,0.1657,1.9998,7.0658,1.703,5.1531,1.5111,0.8521,3.6461,3.4445,4.7637,0.725,0.0437,2.2242,2.7059,2.2049,2.2076,1.4967,3.9181,0.407,0.0227,1.1106,3.5479,0.6075,4.8952,1.3032,2.9934,4.0333,4.1168,2.5992,0.5782,0.0287,3.5054,0.7907,2.3101,0.0253,1.7128,3.8543,1.6992,3.4127,1.8383,1.077,1.807,0.5517,0.2474,4.1224,0.3674,0.0087,2.8482,2.0702,0.4555]}

The wood tree has a strong effect on climate, hence its popularity in the United States.\n\nThe term \" biomass \" is originally coined by German author Adolf von Steiner who describes wood as fuel.

My understanding at the time was that it was inspired by the title and spelling of a song written by a British rock band and called `Sister.' That was a popular misconception, but as I got older I knew the concept more directly. The lyrics seem to have had the opposite effect because the lyrics seemed to have been cut short to only have the 'Sister' parts on the song.

The storm moved northward, impacting several other islands. The storm passed through the Caribbean islands late on Sunday, and into Southern Australia, before moving into Southern Louisiana, causing flooding and a tsunami warning. There have been no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Hurricane Six now has winds of 105 mph (175 kph). Damage is not severe, but has caused a significant amount of instability, especially around the area where water levels are high.\n\nHurricane Six and five other Hurricane Six storm systems were brought ashore Sunday in the Bahamas. Hurricane Six was located about 9 miles from Cape Charles, the easternmost town where 6 of the 10 storms in the previous week have passed to this date. Hurricane Six is expected to become a tropical storm after passing into the southeastern Bahamas by a period of low pressure.\n\nHurricane Six is currently classified as a category 3 cyclonic storm in the U.S. National Weather Service System due to its cyclone potential. Tropical storm activity is currently classified as a category 2 hurricane in the Hurricane Category 4 category.\n\nHurricane Six will form a low pressure area on Thursday night, which will develop into a storm on Saturday morning.

{"id":3938,"ended":true,"length":267,"text":"During the early 20th century, M.A.C. expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough that it changed its name to Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science. The center became known as M.A.C., a name that still stood, even though M.C. didn\u2019t have an official name. The name was changed in 1956 through the merger between four institutes of agriculture.\n\nBy the late 1930s we had entered the 21st century. It wasn\u2019t just the economic and political turmoil of the 1950s and 60s that had us worried about. Agriculture had become more sophisticated, and we figured that it only required a little more creativity from our leaders.\n\nToday there are numerous scientific and theoretical fields in agriculture as well as many other disciplines. In those fields you can see that there are a variety of different methods of farming. There are also a variety of ways we produce food. Even in many states the land is free of any control in areas containing agricultural use.\n\nOn all hands. That\u2019s right there in the books. The M.A.C.

{"id":3373,"ended":true,"length":272,"text":"Since its initial reception, Illmatic has been viewed by music writers as one of the quintessential hip hop recordings of the 1990s, while its rankings near the top of many publications'``Guitarist'' and \"Choreographer'' have largely been a testament to its popularity, including being ranked by the music industry's best of the decade list in Music magazine, the magazine's '99 ranking. Illmatic has also appeared in numerous film and television credits; the album's song \"No Way\" was nominated for one of Grammy-nominated films and was awarded a Gold Medal by the British Film Society and the UK Music Awards. The album's debut single, 'Gravity' also charted at number one on the American Billboard Hot 100, as well as earning it the Number 1 spot as well as being nominated as a BAFTA Music Award Winner at the 2010 Grammy Awards.\n\nILLMIKA PAPER'S \"THUG LESSTHAN MOST\" is one of the most powerful and most influential acts of the 1990s. It is more than just a single song but an entire life that has been a long and winding journey for the musician. A passionate songwriter, Illmatic continues to create his own songs and stories, despite being quite popular nowadays. A legend in the music business, the singer is still one of the most revered acts of his generation. Illmatic has released six solo albums since 2004, although this album is not limited to those as far back as 2000.","token_len":305,"entropy":[5.5743,3.8179,7.0919,0.4477,11.041,4.5276,1.995,1.4666,4.731,1.5814,8.1931,5.2723,1.0332,2.5838,0.0236,0.1777,6.869,0.0196,3.939,1.7269,5.7846,2.048,0.2805,2.9455,0.1095,1.5218,4.9463,2.3458,10.9005,8.8833,0.4233,0.4461,0.4308,4.9734,5.7292,4.1131,17.0968,5.7478,3.2642,2.632,4.5854,4.2137,3.4864,5.9854,2.9975,0.2238,0.4666,7.2845,5.36,1.0179,3.845,4.4618,0.0285,0.9067,4.1134,2.9433,5.0987,5.0307,2.2583,2.5678,1.8363,5.4432,1.6563,1.3898,2.9514,4.1882,1.5288,2.6344,2.8127,2.6993,6.9023,3.4213,1.9037,1.9001,3.086,0.5654,8.2529,4.5411,4.6901,1.7848,2.0868,0.0001,1.9407,1.6935,5.174,0.8537,2.9884,4.5826,0.6643,0.4959,4.8542,3.9779,2.733,2.5468,1.8624,5.3064,0.9369,5.1148,3.7987,2.6899,1.026,1.7523,0.112,5.0784,0.1884,7.5734,4.2267,0.8739,0.0056,2.0045,2.6064,2.3091,5.3473,1.7969,5.3506,1.3743,2.3002,0.3774,4.969,1.3558,3.5928,3.6474,1.3525,6.0014,2.3974,0.5891,0.8219,2.3879,0.5383,1.4096,4.3413,1.4493,0.4276,5.7875,4.3853,4.8606,2.2738,5.5092,6.3764,0.0104,1.5994,0.725,0.874,0.5584,0.3054,4.0412,2.1419,1.5806,0.0237,1.2311,3.9246,0.6,0.0301,4.0465,3.8696,1.4826,6.3226,1.8772,2.1925,6.094,2.4455,0.5702,1.9126,1.5736,4.0834,1.3496,5.5544,2.2582,4.5642,1.517,4.8842,3.7831,0.2121,4.3428,1.9395,0.1258,0.4263,2.236,0.0029,9.9936,4.5874,7.3931,5.7394,4.548,0.558,4.8426,0.0024,3.8968,5.5783,6.0112,5.8786,6.2306,6.2308,5.6707,3.9044,5.9559,4.0046,3.8142,4.7587,3.1579,0.042,0.9839,0.926,5.2463,1.4462,4.1815,2.7652,6.8077,1.2689,0.7467,2.1459,0.0607,0.9721,2.4345,2.0522,6.6567,0.8015,1.0876,0.5125,4.0236,1.4434,4.7761,2.5747,2.5329,6.1118,3.4807,1.8937,1.9394,4.4283,4.6699,2.6562,2.6553,0.927,1.7765,0.9332,3.9997,0.7994,4.3493,5.2975,3.491,0.0663,1.0259,2.3321,0.0071,5.7475,0.5451,3.4892,3.6384,0.7601,3.9306,1.4487,5.7221,1.7383,5.9659,2.6026,5.7734,5.3562,7.6839,0.5617,4.2599,6.2604,1.3069,0.9812,0.7466,2.1464,0.4815,2.3575,2.7547,2.511,4.2357,3.1201,0.0217,0.1395,0.4808,3.4551,4.8577,1.2734,1.7358,0.3837,1.2067,2.5214,0.0028,1.7435,3.1874,3.7452,2.7552,0.1312,2.4931,4.5381,0.7732,5.5872,3.8206,2.5511,2.0089,3.5017,5.7749,0.0734,3.5369,5.0251,5.4225,0.8018,0.0067,3.6593,0.3876]}

From the 1940s \u2013 early 1970s \u2013 the islands recorded record number of cases of serious illness, deaths and hospitalisations. It is thought that a small number of sick persons are killed, many died in their homes. It is thought that 1,000 new cases were registered across the island in 1985, the highest number since the records began in 1980. In 1980 the UK population increased by 20.6%, to 2,721,964.\nOn one occasion alone, in 1973, 13 people were killed and 14 were seriously injured on Skye after a helicopter had crashed in the Skye Harbour in the town.

All had to be flown to hospital for treatment, which may have been more than enough. The incident was reported to the police shortly before the helicopter ended up crashing into a ditch.

{"id":1786,"ended":true,"length":292,"text":"The first US single, `` Ever Present Past ``, made its radio debut on 20 April 2007. Peaking at number 10 in the Bubbling Under Hot 100, and also charting at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. Although it has a much stronger commercial appeal, the original single, `` Always, Always,'' is still considered an experimental hit-song, with lyrics from an early \"A New Way To Live\" recording.\n\nIn the UK, the single came on the radio on 24 March, and stayed in the top 10 for six months. It came into its own, thanks to the use of a variety of musical tools, including electronica, synthwave and ambient influences. The music video had been filmed in Los Angeles by The Bitch Who Cried a Long Way. In 2003, the song was released for its first live performance on the BBC's \"Radio 3\" with Matt Jones. \"Never Forget\", \"Love Is In The Sky\" and \"Good Enough\" (featuring Lizzo) were both released on its second and third editions.\n\nThe following year the single was given a third Ed Sullivan Award performance for best British single. A cover of ''When Her Flowers Were Open'' was released in 2003. The second edition was later recorded for the 1998 album ''How To Win My Heart''.

{"id":2508,"ended":true,"length":219,"text":"Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, K\u012blauea was created as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's underlying mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of the Earth's molten tectonic plates shifting.\n\nThe highest peak of K\u012blauea at the upper end of the K\u012blauea-K\u012blauea crater peak is the peak at the summit of the peak. It was named for the volcano's distinctive yellow-green lava bed. K\u012blauea was the location of numerous lava beds known as the \"k\u016bpa lava.\"\n\nThe lava beds were first discovered in the K\u012blauea-K\u012blauea crater crater, but the volcano was only isolated until about 1990. In 1994, as the erubers expanded, K\u012blauea became the only crater with a lava bed.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, the lava bed was mostly covered in lava. In 2003, the lava dome was uncovered and lava bed locations were identified.\n\nSince 2002, lava sites such as the Kamehameha lava dome and K\u012blauea-K\u012blauea lava dome have been identified. In 2011, lava beds were discovered in K\u012blauea. In 2016, lava beds were found in K\u016blauea.

{"id":2767,"ended":true,"length":266,"text":"With advent of automated telescopes and improvements in spectroscopes, a number of collaborations have been made to map the Universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift telescope takes advantage of the spectral characteristics of the universe, thereby mapping the composition of the universe, thereby deducing the mass, motion and temperature of the sun.\n\nRedshift is a measurement of the brightness of an object (i.e. of the overall spectrum of the observable optical system), typically defined by a spectrum measuring the brightness of the object in color and\/or a wavelength of X-light. The wavelengths of X-light are used as parameter values for all objects in the Universe. For example, if a sky is dark but the sky is bright, and there are only a handful of objects on the sky to see, then X-light is at the minimum brightness (0.1 \u00d7 10\u22125). Redshift is the ratio of X-light to Y-light in the spectral bands and is usually measured in red, while Y-light may be in the color bands. The following diagram illustrates an example that shows the redshift data from the spectrograph. For the diagram use the same formula to form a simple Redshift spectra, with the redshift data for all objects. For this diagram, the X-light spectrum will be in red. The redshift data for an object is measured in the spectral bands, although the values of X-light and Y-light remain constant.","token_len":307,"entropy":[11.8899,0.7036,7.0739,9.7218,2.199,9.2294,0.5712,6.5705,0.5078,4.7414,0.3541,4.274,2.6322,0.0065,9.7773,0.9038,1.3829,1.6568,1.5135,5.8593,0.5887,4.6027,3.0558,8.7805,1.0872,4.7028,0.831,5.1806,2.4363,5.3833,0.0605,2.2726,6.431,7.0883,2.7917,0.7897,3.8594,6.0872,0.0532,2.0117,7.1068,2.1868,0.0022,0.6984,5.299,4.1406,0.1563,1.0202,3.7366,1.9221,3.6604,4.1862,0.9151,5.3637,0.3261,0.6024,2.3363,2.7947,4.2076,5.9312,0.2799,0.8009,4.2185,2.5153,5.5556,1.2164,4.0083,0.4899,0.4365,6.4031,0.907,1.3404,0.0006,3.6925,0.055,2.7031,1.3152,4.2101,0.166,0.4269,3.7057,0.341,2.7396,0.1632,3.6456,3.8721,0.0016,0.0005,0.9828,3.6218,0.9451,6.3431,4.3067,0.7948,0.9375,2.9318,10.7663,3.1142,2.1507,5.2815,3.9749,2.2238,2.4997,3.0836,6.2976,0.751,1.5209,0.2661,1.2542,2.6745,2.6618,5.9897,2.9273,4.7175,0.0016,4.1185,2.7423,1.9025,6.0415,1.4924,5.7436,0.7292,1.7003,4.5713,0.5941,2.1278,0.2915,0.0814,0.7207,3.7453,2.2201,6.9827,3.2469,0.7802,5.2181,4.8295,0.7332,0.1986,1.4501,0.9028,2.9492,0.7282,0.0531,2.7275,1.5682,6.2189,0.7344,3.7813,5.2392,2.0048,2.133,0.2604,0.9394,0.7823,3.5552,3.1192,0.7217,3.2638,1.8278,3.1788,0.055,2.2244,3.6761,0.5932,2.4308,6.2229,3.0233,0.3393,1.0108,3.2505,0.0993,0.0899,1.1755,5.847,1.8721,4.1209,2.6324,3.4131,4.0938,0.5054,2.7278,4.2,0.6798,0.5396,2.8567,2.597,3.3812,0.0542,1.2536,2.7852,2.9617,0.4737,3.1873,0.1027,0.1373,0.4757,3.8544,0.0104,0.0276,1.3588,0.6578,5.2567,3.6298,4.471,1.8302,4.144,2.3205,1.4963,3.2303,2.7071,4.4136,0.6963,0.0824,0.0375,6.6542,0.2623,3.2692,1.6488,5.845,2.6541,0.9531,2.0946,5.1526,2.6185,1.5467,3.5949,0.6438,4.9315,1.3299,1.1657,3.2077,0.1093,4.9723,2.3701,1.6339,5.5269,1.4805,0.2359,1.889,4.5134,2.1774,5.4546,9.5007,0.6662,4.1337,4.5346,3.5095,5.8716,1.4707,5.0471,6.6391,0.056,5.5585,1.3512,2.5761,3.1127,1.0605,2.8746,0.4996,1.742,3.1483,2.7759,1.1124,2.9274,3.1074,3.641,2.4602,1.5874,1.0572,5.1078,0.1936,0.7717,3.4739,4.4626,0.2477,3.4279,1.6217,1.9891,1.7504,2.8019,0.1062,1.0335,1.4714,4.1358,0.3142,1.2842,4.4601,0.8812,2.0428,3.589,0.7104,1.9411,6.7283,1.2364,4.7447,1.6717,2.6446,0.1426,0.0875,1.4159,0.0575,0.0015,0.0092,5.878,1.3522,0.5593]}

The first race of the season was a close encounter, with the field of cars, all of them using tyres that had not been used by another team in the race since 2006. But there did not seem to be any improvement; the race started with slightly wet tyres. And after a slow start, everything got caught up in the rain, and a lot of wet tyres became loose on and onto the track. And it was not enough for drivers to put on a good race.\n\nIn the second turn, the tyre that had been used on the first place field was lost on to the side of the track, but the race ended on a nice twist. The race turned out to be a fair race, due to the quality of the track and the tyres on the track. All that changed in the final lap. In turn 3, the tyre that had been used on the first place field was lost on the side of the track again, but it had not lost on onto the same track. And in the last turn, the tyre that had been used on the first place field lost on the side of the track again. And as in the previous race (5km 2.00), every time it lost on onto the track there was a sudden death.

Tropical Storm Maria was originally going to hit the US, although the storm center estimated that Maria could reach the US early next week and reach Category 3 strength.","token_len":309,"entropy":[5.8096,8.5138,0.7286,7.1072,1.7436,10.4648,10.2882,0.5481,0.0197,3.9681,0.5821,2.3497,1.6639,4.6007,1.8126,4.4218,1.3632,0.5024,13.2877,14.2435,7.6339,3.6055,4.9378,3.1456,3.3807,0.5138,1.8859,7.8052,6.0029,5.5725,0.2713,1.644,3.4258,2.3061,7.8348,3.3136,6.2323,2.9439,2.0869,3.0057,1.4361,2.0196,2.2164,4.5546,5.3064,8.7951,4.7712,1.9802,3.8636,2.9999,2.4588,0.3122,3.4036,2.8485,0.0102,3.9527,3.7176,1.2691,1.6184,4.4473,4.0572,1.0072,0.4812,4.4131,0.2775,2.5704,0.3333,3.9989,5.8447,5.0069,0.1311,1.1057,4.6343,0.9949,4.0292,3.4976,2.062,0.0008,0.0004,0.1827,2.4155,3.1392,1.0451,0.0005,0.0003,0.1529,2.4512,0.7164,0.725,2.042,3.5011,1.3514,0.7991,5.6576,4.1567,0.3317,0.071,2.6116,2.9942,1.1183,0.0008,0.0003,0.0911,1.1785,1.5857,0.1205,0.0009,0.0006,0.0023,0.3036,0.6714,1.084,0.0013,1.5144,2.7755,0.3057,3.8565,0.9814,5.8113,4.7237,0.5235,3.7681,2.0424,1.315,0.2609,3.8666,4.869,0.2913,0.0832,0.141,3.4827,0.7539,0.7227,3.7989,6.6727,7.8632,2.3805,2.015,0.7331,4.2761,16.4855,7.3822,5.0418,6.9144,5.868,3.7908,4.125,1.6207,5.5248,0.1648,4.7381,3.0881,1.739,2.3905,2.6601,3.4645,0.8979,5.7855,2.1061,1.7018,5.6425,2.4942,4.4337,3.7063,3.09,3.5469,4.2956,3.6552,2.6388,0.2051,0.5608,2.2702,0.2072,1.6663,0.5789,3.3994,6.4746,0.2479,0.0702,0.238,3.5707,2.7652,3.3736,0.425,2.3254,4.0921,0.2831,0.9352,3.6406,5.4815,1.3286,4.3234,2.5173,0.3812,3.3442,6.8269,2.536,0.8778,0.0057,2.9561,2.9545,4.8934,3.5891,0.3481,5.0641,3.1737,2.4056,2.3307,1.1174,2.2642,5.8335,0.0763,0.044,4.2788,0.2362,0.6674,0.0003,1.3988,2.8588,3.001,5.5569,1.4863,1.373,1.7393,5.1657,1.8332,2.3923,4.6432,2.4902,0.0339,0.8647,3.3235,0.5767,1.8648,7.2156,0.1757,1.355,1.4232,2.1946,4.8578,0.6747,3.3332,6.3221,2.2555,2.9961,0.3327,4.7923,0.2866,2.7882,2.6534,4.7352,2.6459,1.4931,4.5002,1.2504,1.9729,3.4545,3.3773,0.0282,0.754,0.5564,1.6632,0.6159,1.0897,3.4762,2.2357,0.5006,3.8793,0.0054,4.738,0.0327,1.7106,1.0126,3.7624,4.5542,2.1828,1.0619,4.6682,1.6007,4.6159,2.1558,6.8571,6.0444,0.1175,2.0385,1.006,1.1124,2.4937,5.246,1.866,1.9243,3.5852,4.1448,1.1933,2.5382,1.6474,1.6683,0.8232,1.0472,5.1747,0.9276,0.6688,2.8284,4.3344,6.8029,1.4723,4.5269,1.8454]}

Although this was the first time the highway network was built within the province for a number of years, there are reports that this was the very first time traffic was allowed on the highway.\n\nIt was opened in 1949 and closed in 1973 as part of the provincial highway modernization program (i.e. the Highway 21 project). The final stretch was closed in 1999 as work to reconstruct the highway stalled. The highway is part of the Highway 41 (also known as the Highway 41 East) between Prince Edward Island and the B.C.

Instead of spending the summer recovering from appendicitis, he spent the summer working as an assistant barkeeper on a steamship plying between Chicago and St. Joseph, Ohio \u2013 on the shore of the I.R.C. \u2013 and in the summer months of 1915. It wasn\u2019t until after Christmas that he had to leave the ship and make it back to New York \u2013 where he had grown accustomed to the weather so perfectly. The end of the season at the time, however, did nothing to restore his spirits. Maulbetsch was still on the ship when it was rescued on 3 September 1916. On her way back to her home port of Portsmouth, Connecticut, Maulbetsch was struck by lightning and thrown into a lake. His ship fell nearly to the water, making her one of the only ships to survive \u2014 and she managed to get salvage salvage away from the land.\n\nAfter his return to France, he worked at the shipyard for 30 years until his death in 1922. The last time he spent in France was on 30 October 1912, when he met with Jean-Jacque Belville, who helped him take his first ferry and set him on his way to Marseille, where he lived without drinking water and without food. It is estimated that he went for half a night in a boat under his roof before falling flat on his face and fracturing his nose, although this appears to have been nothing more serious than a medical setback.","token_len":311,"entropy":[9.2922,6.8017,5.0541,6.1629,6.8418,1.5191,4.5169,5.3121,1.8691,10.2888,1.9973,7.3591,0.3004,5.1043,1.7153,3.1834,5.5425,0.183,8.1949,0.0511,0.0012,0.4985,0.4506,2.8936,0.6671,2.8621,3.9637,1.7143,1.8453,3.2135,7.8527,4.091,3.4437,2.0332,7.1598,1.8919,0.001,10.543,0.2981,8.5971,4.6055,0.0739,3.4371,0.0722,6.0348,1.3979,4.9679,6.8044,4.9652,1.5941,5.4132,0.2154,1.8931,7.0764,4.1218,2.4918,0.0353,2.8319,0.1922,2.4439,1.2513,3.1012,1.6178,2.5779,4.8236,3.5395,2.8996,2.4196,4.3199,3.7836,15.6449,8.6932,0.6813,1.0231,3.6997,5.0796,0.8912,0.6753,3.2256,3.1761,2.2177,1.7853,3.8228,1.9288,3.5458,3.2886,1.4929,0.3551,2.8986,0.1591,4.4806,3.8778,0.2809,1.9888,5.941,3.3943,0.0969,1.5594,4.4588,5.413,5.5937,1.728,2.9754,6.436,0.3776,1.1496,3.6967,5.4337,1.7317,4.7149,2.8804,1.6719,0.0072,3.8657,5.0026,0.3082,4.7907,0.7843,2.2421,0.538,7.5958,0.0173,0.0011,0.0019,1.7883,3.0799,3.7196,0.9635,1.7876,1.5404,2.2588,1.8516,5.5529,3.5332,6.189,2.818,2.5347,0.894,3.9247,6.6736,1.0722,0.5891,0.6394,4.4118,1.4112,3.8908,1.1259,6.2804,0.3197,5.3448,0.1862,3.5703,0.0039,0.0008,0.002,1.6195,2.7294,0.2604,2.8021,1.2269,6.3784,1.7989,0.7443,4.0858,0.8067,3.921,5.1952,4.06,5.368,2.7417,0.3062,2.2608,1.345,5.7917,2.4209,4.8649,0.0335,0.242,3.6356,2.8839,1.5519,1.5401,8.1853,1.355,3.8211,5.6357,0.0157,3.0571,10.1887,6.8944,8.4102,0.6838,0.6825,6.6261,1.0001,1.7177,0.0117,4.1312,3.148,1.7233,0.6998,5.6241,0.5731,2.52,3.0416,2.8717,1.1189,5.163,0.8965,2.793,5.4678,0.1556,2.3204,1.6616,0.341,0.5936,3.7452,0.2578,3.2698,3.372,1.0051,0.3942,5.143,1.9286,2.4418,0.2999,2.2676,4.9399,2.2789,4.4925,1.0733,0.3436,0.1958,4.84,2.5808,4.6205,0.8185,2.3378,5.9712,7.1152,5.418,0.7179,1.8006,4.7111,0.512,5.0466,1.9957,3.9406,5.3634,4.2258,4.5596,1.7619,0.8938,0.7719,0.2994,0.5082,4.2486,0.7434,1.6105,1.2872,0.1816,4.5453,6.9151,6.6918,2.2972,2.6019,2.2363,2.4613,0.5066,4.3477,2.5174,3.9437,0.099,1.4595,4.5017,4.2588,5.3564,0.55,6.1716,1.6101,2.2844,2.5322,5.6259,3.4487,4.0741,2.9962,5.1122,7.0605,0.3743,0.0701,1.3577,1.6669,6.3202,0.2656,4.4525,2.5336,5.1498,2.6877,5.4999,0.3247,0.3121,0.3681,6.1529,0.9596,6.8514,0.2616,1.0717,5.5499,5.9579,0.2764]}

Males loosely gather in an arena and compete with each other to get the best females. The kakapo has a much stronger physical and physical advantage than female parrots, and its males have a much lower physical disadvantage. The males of the kakapo are much more resilient to being exposed to an external environment, and the females are not often subjected to the same environmental stimuli. Males are stronger and generally stronger than females, while females tend to have little or no female development.\n\nThe kakapo can be found in Australia as a small, white-footed bird (Lantana ciprospinescus). It is one of the world\u2019s largest birds. It can be found all over parts of Australia, with a population of less than 80,000. Although much less common in the more far-flung regions of the United States and Canada, it is sometimes seen in captivity, which may include in addition to being transported all around the world.\n\nAlthough the kakapo is primarily found in dry and wet places, they are also found in dense vegetation, where it is much weaker and more susceptible to water erosion and rain. The kakapo is a flightless parrot as well, but generally travels in an egg-shaped pattern. If it is not nestled in a specific nest location, its movements will require both human protection and extra protection from predators.","token_len":314,"entropy":[8.5155,6.1615,1.8864,2.4882,2.3878,4.1224,4.0647,1.1886,9.0189,1.6261,6.2191,0.3035,2.3189,0.7769,1.0372,1.659,1.1542,2.5601,1.467,5.4514,0.1179,1.5993,1.4064,2.0416,3.1971,9.0244,4.3584,13.0158,2.8577,0.5252,7.2599,13.4699,7.0715,2.7271,4.2403,5.7154,2.0254,6.7354,1.2106,1.262,0.0176,1.4971,2.7926,1.6226,2.4425,4.6425,0.7084,1.84,1.1056,0.0101,0.0019,2.2808,1.269,5.9932,4.216,6.5413,2.3344,6.3413,4.6882,2.0911,6.8531,0.8143,0.0553,1.1532,1.3916,2.9329,4.928,2.4977,1.5578,1.3013,3.4359,4.871,4.1689,1.2614,2.0513,4.0609,1.7696,0.5771,0.3794,0.0026,0.0007,1.136,3.2771,0.738,5.2814,1.2249,3.5986,5.8434,0.0589,4.7985,3.7348,2.1706,1.3633,0.7793,2.8552,0.7154,0.8275,4.6531,6.5568,4.4179,0.0047,2.3109,0.5689,3.661,4.2246,0.884,4.1641,1.6285,5.9267,2.1042,5.9346,3.5726,0.6468,0.2738,0.9604,3.995,0.4902,2.7576,0.0289,2.0602,5.8509,1.7261,0.0603,7.0623,5.9528,0.6394,1.4128,0.0067,1.7248,0.761,0.0186,0.0011,3.4871,1.1037,1.7714,0.693,5.6159,4.4578,2.2151,3.1752,1.883,4.4732,2.1672,3.7092,3.227,3.1908,4.6935,5.4856,3.075,4.9699,5.405,3.0923,6.0303,9.2197,7.205,1.1706,1.6436,0.6922,3.6136,0.0085,0.5106,4.3304,16.6597,7.9092,2.8207,1.6194,1.9586,1.5331,1.5656,2.7068,1.0668,0.7136,4.8858,0.0633,6.0861,0.0007,1.6015,0.9302,3.5397,2.2525,1.6308,0.5904,3.9763,0.0043,4.895,1.4491,0.0822,0.6905,4.8385,5.5104,3.3574,1.0036,1.3782,1.3633,6.967,6.7133,0.9776,0.0839,0.0006,2.0618,0.4477,1.0989,2.8822,0.0149,1.1407,0.7004,0.0878,1.3777,0.4802,4.7385,1.6352,0.7386,6.3785,2.2684,4.6215,3.0869,3.2757,2.9966,6.671,0.0367,3.7851,4.576,6.8385,3.3775,0.3285,0.4665,0.5238,1.0455,0.0002,5.1826,1.5733,0.3138,0.0024,0.0011,0.6218,5.3885,1.6111,0.1832,7.0798,2.9501,2.7694,2.9287,0.3448,4.0384,1.4063,1.1054,0.4856,0.324,4.9212,1.5304,1.8208,3.5597,2.0692,1.0645,4.5298,5.9194,1.4445,1.9094,1.6757,0.041,5.0042,3.4793,1.8021,4.8062,0.6062,2.0314,0.5565,0.0018,0.0009,0.9427,2.4463,5.9918,0.0177,1.4856,0.0036,5.4094,0.5683,0.8794,2.522,6.5783,6.1125,2.0128,3.6278,5.4762,0.4764,1.504,3.1696,1.2586,5.2226,2.4169,1.0791,2.3528,5.2169,0.0272,0.8056,0.711,4.5856,3.0005,4.1557,0.2673,3.3627,6.0517,2.4981,5.9948,6.3157,5.223,6.8066,0.1354,6.1109,4.3185,1.2902,0.7015,0.2574]}

The castle was used by the Royalist commander Sir Richard Grenville in the 1776 Parliament dispute between the Royalists and Parliament. Lydford Castle was the first of two English castles, Lydford Castle (1746-1768, later Lydford Castle) and Lydford Castle (1841-1937), to be built by the English Civil War leaders Sir Edmund Hall and Sir Paul Nicholls in St Austell.\n\nThe castle was built on land originally belonging to the Earls of Cornwall and became a high point in the historical narrative. St. Marys Catholic Church built Lydford Castle in the 1700s and was a Roman Catholic building. The Catholic Church was converted into a townhouse in 1637 and its current church was purchased in 1843 by a British convert to the church's parish of Lydford in order for the church to become a Catholic parish in 1776. In turn, the church was converted into a townhouse by a Protestant convert to the church's parish in 1776.\n\nReferences\n\nBible of Lydford Castle Library in the 18th century Library, Cambridge,\nAlfred Henry (1812). \"Religious History of Lydford Castle.\"\nSir Humphary W.H.

Burghardt also worked extensively on American politics and the history of American democracy in the years after World War II.","token_len":315,"entropy":[2.5927,6.7214,1.7933,4.1619,1.2769,4.4212,2.4145,0.0059,7.9206,5.8675,5.7031,5.4361,3.3618,2.3024,0.912,13.0093,9.1248,0.4805,0.5962,0.034,0.2494,0.1077,8.5628,2.7532,0.0344,0.0024,3.6265,11.9562,7.0404,8.8783,9.7085,5.4227,2.3057,3.396,9.5041,4.1162,7.5087,4.0477,5.4609,3.254,2.3026,0.079,0.1817,4.988,10.7375,3.4917,0.132,5.1642,3.4805,4.7685,4.1014,0.005,8.2322,3.7549,2.5634,14.7489,3.9592,2.5852,0.1047,0.0057,0.0136,2.5651,1.2904,0.8657,6.1289,0.7833,0.8206,0.1435,2.1855,0.014,0.6125,3.5765,3.1882,0.027,4.3988,0.3674,6.7426,0.2217,0.4698,0.0057,0.0729,0.0305,5.5563,1.073,0.0296,3.8076,4.7774,4.7022,5.4185,1.7398,1.1632,0.8856,6.2647,4.3381,7.1886,1.0813,3.1304,3.8005,1.7235,3.0417,4.6502,1.3619,2.5672,1.7614,1.0896,2.2077,2.5462,0.0514,2.5695,3.1201,0.6127,0.9567,1.1094,4.8056,0.0147,0.5528,1.7466,3.5941,0.3457,5.5815,2.2912,0.1511,2.4693,1.5695,2.81,0.9005,1.9593,0.0017,0.0016,0.0014,6.8603,6.4998,2.8285,1.4239,3.6524,3.9599,0.837,3.2047,5.1677,6.1144,4.4899,4.4002,5.7286,3.1135,4.6498,2.0817,5.389,6.0547,2.0803,1.1064,4.1136,3.5058,2.4258,1.1202,1.6349,2.2699,1.9481,3.2349,2.9919,4.9841,0.9951,1.1582,2.631,0.0093,4.7799,4.3485,1.6293,6.2271,6.2913,3.5836,0.2289,0.9102,0.4314,0.6851,1.4712,0.0036,0.0014,0.0026,3.3821,4.6678,5.8062,0.004,1.8294,1.9002,1.5358,5.3434,4.3332,3.4474,3.3961,0.1852,5.4914,0.081,0.1139,0.0006,0.3103,2.8721,9.302,1.3623,2.1471,0.0285,0.0023,0.0043,4.9205,3.7392,0.0119,3.7556,1.6327,1.4374,0.1482,0.0085,0.0046,1.8788,4.3209,5.5257,0.7838,2.914,5.4614,0.0685,1.5475,2.3046,2.806,3.7051,1.1645,0.6158,0.0027,0.001,0.0013,6.0367,1.7397,0.9672,2.5191,0.188,1.1882,2.3404,2.5409,5.7304,5.3064,0.8804,3.6933,0.0127,3.0009,0.0015,1.9953,1.4132,5.6139,3.2309,1.3205,5.688,0.5406,1.2571,1.5303,6.1551,0.9864,6.9762,3.7466,2.1397,1.9254,4.4959,1.2422,1.0616,5.0658,0.0866,1.8349,1.9345,0.9055,1.6901,1.1486,3.7154,5.8837,2.0324,1.4594,4.2062,4.249,3.6151,1.0909,5.3289,4.5163,4.4184,1.4351,0.3425,5.0548,2.9496,4.2321,0.0725,0.0215,6.3103,0.3518,2.3218,3.3564,0.3519,1.4237,0.0057,0.0008,0.0022,2.3487,3.2432,3.2193,1.5008,2.6333,1.6264,0.8958,2.6017,1.6694,0.0216,1.4738,0.4475,3.8934,1.3441,4.0915,1.7726,0.697,0.0011,1.1348,0.2087]}

The network broadcast the final episode of Season 1 of the competition, in which the cast of 20 celebrities performed during a three-hour and 30-minute marathon of the show. In early October, 1999, the network launched the U.S. Millionaire & the subsequent primetime specials in the USMLC format. The series premiered as a simulcast of its first two seasons at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the USMLC Telecasts Center on May 4, 2001. The series was the first broadcast series that would utilize telecast elements both for U.S. and international commercial television.

By 1779 there was a second bridge, the Bower, which was rebuilt in 1800, on the banks of the Avon.\n\nIt was an architect's home and is home to a collection of the village's most famous landmarks.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Bristol County, West Virginia\n\nReferences","token_len":317,"entropy":[2.8999,6.8253,3.3236,1.2329,4.7881,9.1584,2.3215,1.7941,7.2242,0.3797,7.9512,2.2201,6.526,8.4448,1.3657,0.9615,1.8998,3.3198,7.5755,1.5946,3.4993,9.2927,0.6142,0.7712,0.502,0.8798,0.7698,2.692,3.9667,0.368,0.1372,0.7812,2.0717,4.2748,8.0734,3.6777,4.8014,5.2132,1.2188,5.6708,1.9921,2.6208,0.9105,2.7177,3.2968,6.041,3.8855,2.2427,0.254,6.9334,1.8303,2.9864,4.3763,0.0059,1.1526,2.6059,7.684,0.5604,1.1582,4.6085,0.2029,3.7802,4.7214,3.5535,5.9119,2.4196,2.8104,3.9635,2.2398,0.3526,0.604,1.4628,2.2392,3.9802,1.5926,3.4242,2.1418,0.7893,4.5256,0.049,0.0832,0.776,1.3949,0.054,4.1059,0.8302,2.863,2.9298,0.4383,1.3558,2.6947,0.9952,0.5361,3.4219,5.1998,3.1129,1.1982,2.3271,5.7301,2.1738,4.3809,4.3423,4.5779,1.4948,0.0437,1.993,0.96,4.5703,1.3527,5.7199,2.5767,1.3464,0.9362,0.0003,3.6761,0.8796,6.4735,1.3758,2.1633,5.036,3.1312,1.4637,6.0782,0.0149,4.6925,0.0401,0.4989,5.2785,5.0723,1.6034,2.2147,4.0805,6.6397,3.1555,4.9313,2.2351,0.7737,2.7762,3.4031,4.038,0.0458,0.7155,3.1972,0.6734,1.6255,5.9249,2.9802,4.507,0.0112,6.5555,5.3679,3.9494,5.3802,5.1342,1.525,2.8605,3.3703,3.5568,5.0559,2.503,0.0033,1.1027,4.2717,0.4676,1.8089,3.1208,0.0173,1.2563,3.6386,0.0068,0.2737,5.7116,3.9468,1.7122,2.1581,2.6702,0.2227,3.1474,0.798,1.6497,0.4155,0.0012,0.0413,0.8813,1.7373,3.6418,1.9829,0.8583,0.5094,1.8418,5.7957,3.4561,1.4958,1.7188,3.3914,1.221,3.285,0.5071,4.6647,0.0073,0.2076,0.8587,0.0616,3.8272,6.0879,0.9043,1.3779,2.2671,5.1736,2.0181,4.9273,5.0752,3.1962,2.3623,1.4113,1.4175,0.0002,1.1536,2.5113,1.5745,0.7434,5.4488,1.1634,1.7264,2.9832,2.5772,4.1613,6.0834,4.3311,2.909,3.5184,5.85,2.6551,6.5172,0.9141,2.48,1.1936,1.3496,3.2492,1.6208,4.6267,2.7952,4.4939,5.9645,2.7002,2.1662,3.1326,4.196,3.13,4.2121,3.2878,1.8337,0.8251,4.8992,0.3928,2.0218,2.3311,3.3781,0.3046,1.1828,1.4479,0.4338,6.624,0.7133,5.1637,2.2931,3.5538,0.3732,1.3835,0.0166,0.1933,0.1457,0.0094,1.2138,1.2282,0.0002,2.9741,1.0093,5.0533,6.9666,1.356,6.9582,2.0043,3.4769,3.8774,0.0849,2.1523,3.8273,0.0154,3.2322,5.9068,0.4841,3.2215,1.5208,3.3377,0.9719,1.2035,0.0003,4.6486,1.1509,1.6687,24.5356,3.9344,0.266,0.0235,0.0569,8.6138,4.827,2.0529,4.8835,1.7461,5.0148,4.3088,1.6716,0.0002,4.9203]}

Although this tank can hold 750 litres of liquid, the company has not yet made much progress in developing new tanks that are cheaper to produce. At the same time, Mikengreg aims to focus on low-level technologies like battery and power technologies.\n\nSolipskier is currently on trial with the company's own liquid-crystal tank, but will have to cut costs to turn it into a successful one.\n\nMeanwhile, Mikengreg is considering starting with the company's top technologies -- \"the first time we use electricity in the field is very important and that is very big news\" for Solipskier, said Wohlwend.\n\nMikengreg will start with the liquid-crystal tank, and then switch to the second- and third-generation fuel tank and the second liquid-crystal tank, which means that Mikengreg users can use the new technologies.

New York City was the capital city of the United States until the mid 20th century. American skyscrapers began to emerge in 1892 in the United States.\n\nThe early New Century started with the rise of New York City and its suburbs. New York City started to lose its place as the capital city when World War I started. This was the beginning of the financial crisis in the US. With the advent of technology, the financial crisis in the US was worsened as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The world was beginning to lose its place as a capital city due to the lack of available housing in areas surrounding New York City. The financial crisis in the US also played a role in the decline in residential housing values in New York City. With increasing numbers of people moving to the US and to California due to the coronavirus pandemic, developers and investors started to build more affordable housing.\n\nHistorical statistics\n\nSee also\n19th Century New York\n19th Century New York City\n19th Century New York Town Line\n19th Century New York Village\nVictorian Victorian Modern Society\n\nReferences\n\n\n, 2008a","token_len":319,"entropy":[12.8744,0.7697,0.0001,11.1715,5.4184,7.8225,1.7508,0.0921,0.0027,2.129,4.2329,8.4219,0.0969,5.1568,1.9136,6.968,0.811,2.4597,3.083,1.8133,4.8457,0.1598,6.2124,1.781,7.0739,1.2282,1.2504,5.4054,4.0763,0.1733,1.4913,0.0626,0.8813,1.3088,0.2775,7.5557,2.7297,0.8818,2.3694,0.0164,3.4078,2.1472,3.8095,0.0712,4.7377,3.5519,0.0101,0.0105,3.1108,6.016,0.6447,4.1246,6.7145,2.0538,2.3317,0.0314,1.1721,2.6771,0.7821,0.381,0.1924,4.7268,0.2219,4.8887,0.1863,4.22,0.1839,4.9775,0.1915,2.8614,0.2328,2.3521,4.609,3.6656,2.2055,0.0049,0.2402,2.7596,0.6114,2.7585,2.658,1.6795,4.3038,0.1597,1.1147,2.3706,1.2638,2.7363,4.0454,0.2823,0.5496,2.713,0.0868,2.3401,1.5608,2.376,3.9749,0.0094,0.0932,0.6869,6.6418,1.0634,0.2593,0.0082,3.6456,1.172,3.1368,0.7858,4.5793,3.3715,3.1717,1.1852,2.2229,0.0379,1.2828,2.6839,0.0029,2.1881,3.744,4.5514,9.1195,7.0285,0.7835,0.6819,3.5138,0.0471,3.956,0.0752,0.6968,2.1523,2.5317,2.6854,0.6981,2.4824,0.0672,0.851,4.3985,2.0919,5.2729,0.5112,5.4342,0.7794,0.8844,1.8852,2.4028,4.5348,4.461,0.0055,0.7157,2.4571,0.7611,3.7574,2.3652,1.9257,1.9505,0.0358,0.6013,5.5697,0.368,2.4133,1.2802,3.8814,1.0217,4.6657,0.5887,4.3658,0.0021,5.8526,0.7587,1.5229,3.0219,1.112,3.1215,0.3262,0.3268,2.3688,5.9087,4.0688,3.182,0.0535,0.0784,0.8098,14.6053,10.3844,1.5631,3.6742,0.0948,0.8262,1.4535,4.8201,2.265,4.1318,0.0267,2.5404,0.369,1.6133,0.7192,1.1033,4.0486,1.3748,2.2907,0.0086,0.5537,4.1583,0.0028,6.0326,3.3867,3.179,5.4673,5.8999,2.2427,0.0025,0.6446,0.2648,1.7912,3.3146,0.2125,1.8853,0.3281,0.1543,2.8779,5.4419,0.2089,0.6837,0.2495,0.5274,3.0425,1.5861,5.6114,2.1968,4.4722,0.9042,1.7567,0.0051,0.3232,0.424,4.2815,5.7121,2.999,0.0463,1.5292,1.3829,1.0298,1.3289,2.544,2.5662,5.2709,5.5274,4.3863,0.0078,0.7875,14.2856,0.0013,0.0032,1.2842,0.0197,0.2489,7.2462,2.9032,2.3941,1.934,0.5325,3.0822,2.2963,2.8597,0.3789,1.1288,1.5049,0.0002,6.2397,0.8939,6.8575,1.8953,0.0003,4.8284,0.4931,1.2125,17.4754,4.3257,0.5794,2.2472,0.2371,2.1221,17.0581,1.6821,0.1165,0.6857,0.084,1.2861,1.0087,16.1361,0.9447,0.0403,0.3102,0.0667,8.0311,5.2235,0.554,9.1198,0.2762,0.0172,0.149,0.0121,6.0006,0.7612,9.2224,0.2847,4.9007,5.885,6.1925,0.4415,0.5469,6.8198,5.6077,0.0006,8.8884,7.3894,5.487]}

We must never forget her loss of the ability to speak, she was one of the best people in the whole world. She had the ability to make people happy and help them in whatever way she wanted. She had her voice as a teacher, she did the speaking and had all of her songs that have had music in them because... She did. She was not only a great teacher but one who has worked with children her own age whom we all really know a lot about. She was always upbeat and bubbly even when things were difficult, she was very positive and always had a smile on her face even when all of the things she did were wrong. She was also a really nice person and would work for people or give them support if they needed it and to be in the company of people who loved her.\n\nHannah and her husband James were divorced.

Following the formation of the administrative area, Maiminga became the chief of Ch'quimula in 1492. The Ch'quimula people then moved into parts of the Poqomam and Chajoma settlements. Ch'quimula's first settlement was established in 1493 in the district of Ch'quimula in the mountains where the Ch'quimula people were. The Ch'quimula people then moved to the modern department of Ch'quimula in 1495, where they were also in the company of the Ch'quimula people, which settled in Ch'quimula, Ch'Quimula and Ch'qimula. Ch'quimula is the modern title of Ch'quimula in the north of the present-day province of Ch'quimula.","token_len":321,"entropy":[9.1252,8.1085,6.6456,5.8095,2.3091,6.8231,3.7688,15.2182,10.0487,0.1452,0.256,0.0957,6.7474,2.3987,5.5412,2.1445,1.6863,11.7228,1.2435,3.2505,1.811,0.9985,8.418,8.5287,0.653,7.0498,0.3392,0.13,0.2591,6.3552,0.6494,2.212,1.0328,0.887,8.0785,5.1745,5.2889,6.0713,5.018,4.6828,8.1288,6.2894,3.032,3.3588,7.4359,0.3481,5.1399,5.3692,5.0169,1.7599,2.505,4.8052,1.9692,7.9722,1.5638,5.6571,0.4477,0.5058,5.1919,1.0629,1.1538,0.3014,2.3475,0.0087,0.032,4.0483,0.0003,0.0514,1.6115,1.6328,4.69,1.9982,3.4303,0.394,4.5894,3.474,4.6122,1.8157,1.6678,1.6012,3.2877,1.0618,0.0919,0.0416,0.0427,1.8653,4.3612,4.6075,5.5636,0.6449,7.8261,0.2154,1.9523,0.3528,0.1315,0.0528,0.2299,0.4254,1.358,2.3367,1.6307,0.1883,0.1062,1.2304,1.5251,0.8389,2.2705,0.0316,1.4429,5.313,1.6098,3.6453,5.3331,1.0261,5.7422,0.092,2.6299,0.1794,0.0532,0.0256,0.0511,5.7436,5.1385,4.8376,5.5736,2.1664,1.422,3.2398,3.2787,3.4988,1.9473,1.8073,0.4195,4.2335,1.6245,0.9604,1.4951,2.7506,2.1787,1.1364,3.9443,3.3853,0.425,1.3982,2.2458,1.4932,6.9483,0.5373,4.2965,0.0229,0.4244,6.0126,5.5322,1.1534,4.2597,0.0185,0.0024,0.0039,3.4681,1.0957,1.5199,0.8087,1.1341,0.0325,0.175,0.0045,0.0245,3.5704,1.0112,1.9579,1.2967,1.7208,2.3204,0.0616,0.1573,0.0074,0.1454,0.5977,4.5699,3.1634,2.0919,7.9952,0.187,0.4544,4.4636,0.3382,0.041,0.0204,1.525,0.3352,0.1222,0.0062,4.8025,1.6027,3.4979,0.0371,0.1792,0.0022,0.0291,3.7947,3.6092,2.2105,0.6125,4.2371,0.8612,1.4587,2.2348,2.57,0.4849,4.1413,0.1356,1.7018,0.714,0.2648,0.0248,0.0489,3.0818,0.4799,4.0958,5.0074,1.3402,1.6095,0.1321,0.0573,0.0027,0.1295,0.3946,2.3026,4.6671,1.495,1.4807,0.0223,0.0292,0.001,0.0714,0.4699,2.6332,0.9249,1.7495,0.7033,6.2613,0.5793,0.1137,0.1631,0.568,0.0387,0.0011,0.0227,1.536,2.5532,1.5646,1.2341,2.3137,0.5176,2.9088,4.8537,5.1102,1.9181,6.2326,0.019,1.0177,0.6672,0.0619,0.0559,0.005,0.1054,0.2447,2.0964,3.2157,4.9579,0.9012,3.5751,0.1564,0.2061,0.0045,0.0226,2.5831,3.687,0.9467,7.1308,0.0299,0.1677,1.8147,0.8839,0.3559,2.2095,0.0255,0.0349,0.7536,3.5542,0.0232,0.1378,0.0015,0.0193,3.4117,2.4531,4.9641,7.1229,0.4943,1.631,0.0295,0.1001,0.0034,0.0435,2.1558,0.8589,5.1807,1.5229,0.5479,4.9409,3.3375,0.0026,2.7362,0.2448,1.7151,0.6243,0.0859,0.0034,0.0315,0.5591]}

The serpent is linked to Satan. The serpent is linked to God\n\nIn \"A New Way of Mind\" for those of us who remember the beginning of our religion, the philosopher Thomas Aquinas discusses what we see as the \"real and natural laws\" that will hold true for millions of people.\n\nHis point is that \"the great and basic reality is that there will always be an evil man who will use the power of his will in order to get a more free and prosperous society. This will have an effect on all who have become a violent victim of this great law of evil. He will also make the criminal who has become a victim of this law much harder to do and that is in itself a crime. It will happen even if all those who believe in the faith and the law will lose everything they give.\"\n\nIn the end, Aquinas concludes that the Bible \"will forever teach that the Devil and Lucifer are the enemies of good and God\".\n\nThis comment from the paper is from yesterday's Post in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and has an article here. If it contains a reference to the \"book\" that is published as being a Bible version of the \"book\" rather than an actual Bible, then I will be very upset.","token_len":322,"entropy":[10.7109,2.5241,10.0076,0.0334,0.6628,8.8111,2.8722,1.5125,8.2267,0.0187,2.6404,1.6458,2.2716,5.2694,0.6477,1.9413,0.0011,2.691,2.0271,2.3284,0.8709,7.8343,0.2972,0.2464,0.0007,0.8897,5.6892,5.8377,0.9929,3.2289,4.9916,0.9878,2.6835,10.5559,0.2349,5.7796,4.2252,0.4049,1.0279,5.8911,0.2664,8.6375,0.559,0.6087,6.7672,1.3953,0.9152,4.2827,0.8577,3.1501,5.3061,0.0573,4.0536,1.9129,0.9914,4.0144,0.1739,2.5929,0.0514,0.1979,2.9231,0.2481,0.6383,2.969,0.2307,3.1328,0.0361,3.9326,0.2296,0.7579,2.0701,0.1534,1.4039,0.0196,3.243,6.9032,0.0364,3.8257,5.6007,3.6405,3.7704,5.9637,0.5874,6.9284,1.6624,6.7726,3.7525,3.1114,0.6554,0.4466,6.9442,1.0326,5.6876,0.1558,2.3873,4.1743,0.4711,1.9655,5.6919,4.0018,0.4099,0.0,4.9955,3.8221,2.1653,4.088,1.023,0.8306,2.8008,4.5408,3.8545,4.0374,4.7845,1.28,2.1216,6.6315,5.7628,2.0921,1.3987,5.2315,0.0968,2.3995,1.4968,1.6001,0.0002,5.4058,4.0589,0.4683,0.5182,3.4509,1.6214,5.3605,3.0854,6.4988,5.3436,2.8711,1.3411,2.5113,3.7965,1.5663,0.0599,3.2577,3.1741,2.8314,2.0983,1.2848,4.7485,2.3573,2.1981,0.1298,1.6527,3.3279,3.6024,1.3025,0.014,3.7373,4.1241,6.0072,6.1266,1.624,3.2107,2.2393,1.6515,2.5539,1.7778,4.424,2.925,1.3685,0.7457,2.2511,3.4232,3.3183,4.4099,4.0046,10.1319,6.1163,0.3547,2.4016,5.3411,3.6219,1.9783,2.6384,0.9816,3.6258,0.3924,3.4441,2.8083,2.1932,6.6557,4.5136,2.4078,2.4896,0.3982,2.4169,0.7669,0.7649,0.5816,4.6404,4.3209,0.4643,4.6057,3.7661,4.6517,3.1921,5.0651,3.4763,0.8116,4.3278,1.3061,2.8671,1.3559,5.7902,3.43,1.8261,3.701,2.488,0.2311,5.3872,0.3833,1.2998,7.2033,2.4371,2.0983,2.7654,4.1645,6.0665,5.0785,1.564,7.5344,4.551,0.4335,0.0002,2.6801,2.1192,2.2419,0.2379,2.2313,0.0028,3.0407,1.2426,2.0832,5.593,3.4853,3.1428,5.0727,2.5761,1.1888,1.7339,3.948,3.2394,5.3537,0.7804,1.5646,4.8088,0.1366,3.2566,1.0435,6.4609,5.1435,0.4802,0.0001,3.3563,6.6695,3.3136,2.0322,9.2446,2.0411,3.3212,7.4011,0.4834,6.1601,4.5124,5.0991,1.7427,6.4526,2.0629,2.0441,0.0229,1.2825,2.9202,3.7874,6.2543,4.897,3.6691,0.5672,4.8026,5.2039,6.0841,2.693,4.1828,0.1182,1.3356,3.1735,6.5465,1.5039,2.5688,2.2222,3.6897,4.4551,5.577,2.3255,4.2963,4.5156,0.3294,0.6249,2.7261,2.9373,0.8664,7.5671,0.0246,2.1696,1.0786,1.6301,0.5492,1.7563,1.4707,2.6619,2.7573,3.0025,3.8302,0.7288]}

Beckett offers clemency if Will agrees to search for Jack's compass'. Cutler, who is serving a 25 year sentence in a Washington prison for harboring, trying to rob and murder, is being held at Waverley in Rhode Island, the largest prison in the country. But now, they can be found with the hope of freedom \u2013 with not a trace of the Jack Sparrow name, and everything that was said about the ship's captain. They will have to make a choice and, along with Grace, they must try to save her face as she walks out into the ocean. To keep themselves safe from the evil that had taken them from their home, they must use every last bit to stop Jack Sparrow from being one of his men and turn her into his own weapon.\n\nBy the end of the film, we also know that the ship was in the water by the time we saw Mrs. Beckett. The film also shows that the ship was actually a pirate ship that was used by Captain Jack Sparrow in his revenge for Captain Jack Sparrow. A few details have been added and I'll give the movie a few stars, but I have a few questions for you. How did the movie get developed? Was it created as part of the movie production schedule?

It discusses the compatibility of game theory with the legacy of the Chicago School of sociology and with the perspective of the school on the relationship between individual action and individual experiences. He also reviews the inter-cultural and social dynamics of contemporary history while pointing out that an integrated study of these relationships is essential in an effective assessment of current contemporary events.

After the first recordings of the album, The Beatles went silent.\n\nDutkiewicz said that his favorite studio to record for Aftershock was Abbey Road, where the group would make their very first recordings and also make their first studio albums. In 1992, Dutkiewicz started Karmax Records. After Karmax released \"The Misfits\", a collaboration with the Beatles, and was a huge success as well. Now, he works as a producer for The Beatles on their various albums \u2014 \"Misfits\" and \"The Lazy Side of the Rock Scene\".\n\nDutkiewicz is the co-producer of Karmax Records' \"Guitar Hero\" album. Dutkiewicz has worked extensively with The Beatles in studio recordings and on their other works \u2014 \"Slamming the Rock\", \"Walking Through the Walls\" and \"The Man in the Pinstripes\".

{"id":2153,"ended":true,"length":312,"text":"The magnetic field of a star is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of < unk > is the main component of the magnetic field of the star. Accordingly, the current in the center of the star is driven, while the voltage of the plasma flows in the center of the star is proportional to the voltage current of the plasma. If an external magnetic field is maintained, the current may be reduced to 1V.\nIf the magnetic field is maintained at this level, a phenomenon of changing the distribution of the plasma, due to differences between directions of the plasma flow, is likely to occur. Accordingly, the concentration of the plasma may be decreased. This phenomenon may also be caused by a relatively longer period. Consequently, to prevent this phenomenon, the plasma must move out of the center of the star.\nHowever, a typical magnetic resonance tomography image that is provided on a detector or an optical disk is provided that is in a low-magnitude range and requires a low-magnitude camera. Accordingly, since the magnetic field of the star is generated within a region such as the interior of the star and must be kept low, it is difficult to detect the magnetic field of the star. Additionally, since the magnetic field of the star is in many directions, the detector cannot be used for detecting the magnetic field because it must take a relatively long time to register the magnetic field. To this end, the detector is of such a nature that it is difficult to detect only the magnetic field in very low-magnitude cases.","token_len":331,"entropy":[11.1146,0.6634,1.6748,2.4879,4.3727,1.404,4.5321,6.0784,8.4421,0.4169,1.0932,7.1498,4.1194,8.7862,1.3386,4.4352,2.1926,0.6761,2.2311,6.3953,1.3771,8.928,0.908,3.9083,10.5119,3.5758,0.7301,5.7602,0.434,1.669,8.3699,1.1004,4.9387,0.4181,13.4271,10.6376,6.8336,4.0698,2.8957,3.7351,5.8969,3.6008,0.5757,0.4902,2.359,0.228,1.726,0.7259,0.404,0.4337,6.8213,0.0502,1.1172,5.2684,3.4066,0.7066,4.5888,0.19,0.4648,0.8593,1.077,4.392,5.0461,5.1461,0.3724,6.2507,1.8217,0.2333,2.6614,3.1755,2.4681,1.1934,3.2347,0.7471,0.0744,0.1831,5.5767,3.6616,0.014,0.3188,3.1362,6.1442,2.0571,0.1319,1.0019,0.658,4.7288,4.2073,3.0653,0.9457,0.0639,0.9297,5.1522,1.3293,0.7494,2.4766,5.012,0.9386,3.4523,1.6835,4.5665,4.6638,2.1619,2.0098,12.3051,0.8118,1.5585,0.1003,0.9617,1.426,2.2816,4.7665,1.9402,0.3374,3.2053,6.1969,3.3792,7.3867,2.1143,4.8978,0.0848,1.1624,2.8848,3.8845,4.8588,0.0328,6.0671,3.2291,6.7132,0.5177,1.0433,1.0492,2.9132,0.347,1.9968,5.1699,0.6334,0.3186,0.3425,6.1863,0.0275,1.2444,6.7768,0.1321,1.8226,0.2297,2.0789,0.8715,2.8095,1.566,2.861,1.6632,1.8125,2.1747,1.5908,2.1694,0.0474,2.5584,6.6854,6.9637,2.5562,6.4454,5.2397,0.0361,5.7297,2.7772,1.6414,1.0685,0.6606,1.0122,0.9063,2.101,5.6472,4.5164,0.2568,0.3905,1.6761,0.2137,0.0611,0.3232,1.4762,1.0595,4.9014,0.0126,3.0359,5.2106,3.4577,6.3832,7.2757,0.0578,4.4772,4.6556,1.4047,4.8594,4.0238,2.0872,7.7751,3.3345,3.4078,2.4536,4.3295,1.994,4.9526,3.7091,2.4418,4.7055,1.7023,4.9796,1.5224,5.7113,1.1252,0.1568,2.8529,2.3939,6.4556,1.7,3.1806,0.6846,2.8679,0.0029,0.0324,5.8543,1.2131,6.5227,0.0081,6.3258,0.7656,2.2273,0.2129,0.9454,0.6352,0.7256,0.3633,2.6782,1.6237,2.8458,0.4095,6.5173,0.3847,0.6309,2.582,0.3309,0.6049,0.7601,3.3784,6.0175,0.6564,2.3213,3.385,0.5751,2.3869,0.4787,3.856,0.1528,2.12,1.6437,2.339,0.4815,1.0273,0.4691,0.7318,1.0267,5.9115,0.0076,3.0359,0.5192,1.4905,0.1571,0.6607,0.1648,0.1723,0.4618,4.3865,5.2644,1.8068,0.7118,1.7223,5.4762,2.7428,1.7755,0.9684,2.1565,1.7815,0.8379,1.2505,0.2447,6.1389,1.608,3.0491,4.9225,1.9801,4.6958,0.2209,0.1092,0.3054,6.7315,0.5933,1.425,0.2479,1.1113,4.75,4.0837,0.082,0.0331,1.134,1.875,1.5741,6.3167,4.9157,1.3671,1.6533,0.1304,0.5842,1.3684,2.3686,0.1007,1.1087,5.9928,0.67,1.112,0.197,3.4034,5.485,1.8978,0.361,0.1413,0.0008,0.0079,5.9284,0.4046]}

{"id":742,"ended":true,"length":296,"text":"Lawton continued to play for both Everton and England during the war. However the FA decided to not award full caps for England appearances during the war, and as a result his 24 caps have not been received by his country. Although he has a much stronger physical and physical profile, he is rarely seen, and while he has not appeared for England he is still the leading scorer among goalkeepers at the moment.\n\nBournemouth were the first clubs to sign Sunderland's James Maddison from the North London club last Saturday, though the former Sunderland striker has not played since August 31, despite having five minutes of playing time on Tuesday night due to a calf problem. The 22-year-old has shown little improvement since December 1st but had two goals and one assist in his last 11 appearances last season to help Bournemouth progress to the quarter finals of the FA Cup. As the English FA's official top scorer after the 2013-14 season, Maddison has struggled for the England national team.\n\nDespite helping Bournemouth reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup, Maddison was sacked from his role as a substitute in the 3-2 loss at Wembley on Wednesday - and that further soured the outlook for the long-term future of the youngster. Bournemouth have yet to prove anything, with Maddison having only been in the playing XI since December 2nd after just three appearances before the injury.\n\nFor all the latest football news, rumors and updates, follow our Google News channel on Twitter and Instagram\n\nCatch up on all the latest football news, rumours and updates online by following our Facebook and Twitter pages.","token_len":334,"entropy":[8.3098,7.0642,1.2527,4.8216,3.34,6.2543,7.1515,0.0471,5.7026,3.5791,1.1296,7.8477,1.2043,4.9014,4.2386,5.8833,4.5169,0.9497,3.8208,2.5759,7.8791,6.5472,1.4917,2.5303,11.7073,3.0017,0.4474,0.8141,1.7302,1.8633,5.1127,0.726,0.1483,3.9421,8.5098,1.9351,4.6295,1.6459,0.3523,5.1305,1.7429,3.2838,1.688,0.4052,6.1562,1.1221,2.0746,4.3072,6.6471,3.9105,5.2026,2.5228,3.8347,3.9402,1.1438,1.0432,1.1635,5.9281,0.9395,5.9844,1.1042,5.4276,0.6737,1.7302,3.7791,4.3609,2.4128,1.0295,2.3979,1.656,2.3606,3.9246,3.8302,1.0805,4.415,3.9963,0.0252,3.1531,1.3335,2.775,0.4372,0.6248,0.0056,4.808,3.7786,0.0072,3.2581,2.286,1.76,5.1886,0.2783,3.5283,6.4554,1.0651,4.7587,6.7359,0.3148,2.1492,3.1652,5.237,2.0591,0.2971,4.4996,6.3654,1.2589,4.767,2.0016,3.81,3.5786,2.5813,1.6115,1.3453,1.0028,1.2417,3.5433,3.5807,1.7977,5.5029,2.6953,5.9409,6.1369,1.4316,3.9286,0.0025,2.3439,7.5648,1.7492,6.4326,0.0046,1.1034,2.4023,2.3714,0.1691,2.4864,4.0956,0.2625,0.0033,0.0341,0.0009,1.7152,4.5474,4.0897,2.802,0.9403,7.0636,3.8638,3.4017,3.0687,5.3141,4.2766,1.3789,0.6387,1.8934,0.0139,0.6419,1.9354,1.0416,3.963,1.5768,5.418,0.7457,4.6821,1.178,5.6526,0.0019,0.0017,5.5385,0.5392,0.1578,4.076,2.0855,1.1942,0.075,0.9314,0.0334,0.5891,5.5675,2.9979,4.988,4.2687,3.3989,4.0712,7.3631,0.4969,6.118,2.0656,4.373,1.2661,0.0458,0.559,0.2195,0.925,0.0023,1.1091,6.5164,3.2581,3.2814,5.2807,2.1821,0.1728,2.3476,1.0303,0.0002,4.3217,7.0365,1.9888,0.0012,0.0004,3.1332,0.1064,1.2902,0.4204,0.0628,0.2188,0.1472,0.8437,0.0074,1.158,1.1292,0.0042,2.752,5.5719,2.4367,1.1676,2.4017,0.6788,2.4408,1.9019,1.8138,0.6332,3.8729,0.0142,1.3634,2.9936,1.9918,3.7459,1.3565,3.1721,7.3281,2.6342,4.1744,8.1889,6.8197,0.025,1.9908,5.9257,0.424,1.1719,6.6649,0.2055,0.4299,1.0576,0.2342,1.0615,5.1419,0.2486,4.2886,0.0014,0.0006,2.1273,3.1696,0.0023,6.4012,4.5887,3.2204,2.8663,1.6385,0.008,2.6989,2.0838,2.6536,2.7685,1.1191,4.7881,3.5292,3.2278,2.9743,2.9641,0.1096,5.2779,5.3462,2.3439,2.0466,5.5552,1.6242,2.7036,0.6204,0.8416,0.0002,5.1501,2.3407,0.4384,0.0498,1.6371,1.49,2.0224,4.9827,0.4777,7.881,0.2856,0.1032,4.0133,7.3792,6.5257,2.7707,3.7714,0.2555,1.8845,3.4058,3.4661,0.0003,5.9471,4.0241,0.7073,0.5957,0.8139,0.4277,0.3849,2.7691,0.3476,1.8562,2.4128,0.0631,0.1083,6.4807,3.1722,0.9958,2.0426,2.9762,2.2019,0.6797,1.4199,0.9554]}

{"id":7,"ended":false,"length":322,"text":"In the late 1920s, Barker began to doubt she was doing enough for the church and considered focusing solely on sacred works. Family and friends recommended she continue secular and sacred works, however the church became aware of her work as late as 1925, so she focused on her work as a clergyman, preacher, and a minister. This work also drew out the stories of her husband and children. She began to teach the Sunday School of the Holy Life (1931 ). By the summer 1930, she began her second sermons and she worked at this parish.\n\nAt this point, she decided and began her ministry. She opened one parish and closed all her two. Soon after, she had left her job as a parish manager in order to pursue her spiritual and financial growth. She decided to quit as a manager and then began her spiritual work as a preacher, a church minister, and a minister. After the outbreak of the Second World War in Germany, Barker and many churches were looted by German soldiers and their wives or children. In 1933, she and all her followers were forced to leave their church and went to a convent where she continued her work as a parochial minister of the Holy Life and to teach in the parochial school.

However, due to an accident in the road, the film was delayed and the schedule was shifted to Madhu for shooting of the next day. Later, we got the news that Mohanlal would soon return from the shoot at Thodupuzha.\nNow, thanks to the help of M. P. Soman who started shooting in Thodupuzha on 14 August 2013, Mohanlal is set to release his final and most interesting film titled as Deepak. This will feature Anil Kapoor in his role as Vijay Varma, the mysterious 'Pilgrimage' star.\nHe also worked on the remake of King Palki and had previously directed in Kuch Kuch Bhi Virendraa. The film has also been adapted into a movie by P Soman and is being made by a private contractor.

{"id":662,"ended":false,"length":308,"text":"Large cathedrals such as Elgin had many chapel altars and daily services and required to be suitably staffed with canons assisted by a plentiful number of chaplains and vicars. Bishop Andreas allowed for the use of cathedrals, as long as they were in a separate space and in the same order, at the appropriate times of Christ's crucifixion. There are two types of cathedrals: one served by priests, another served by nuns.\n\nOne chapel was the Elgin Chapel, located on the southern side of St. Paul's Square in St. Peter's Cathedral. The chapel was built on the grounds of the church, and opened in 1790. It was used to house baptisms and other services by Catholic priests, but the chapel was often used for chapel and choir services. The building was opened as a chapel by Pope John Paul II in April 1971 and its current location was chosen because of its proximity to the church.\n\nThe chapel also provided a chapel in the shape of a cross and had a number of altar panels. It served its purpose, as far as the catholic mind could understand, by placing a cross with a cross inside the front, or by holding up a cross, that indicated to the catholic mind and soul that the catholic church was God's church; however, this provision was short lived, as the Holy Spirit was not present as it had been with other liturgical sites before it.\n\nThe chapel was completed in June 1971 and contains the remains of one of the seven mausoleums of Christ's crucifixion, which were added to the Cathedral of St. Francis of Assisi in the early 19th century.\n\nReferences","token_len":346,"entropy":[9.6391,4.9991,0.0488,5.921,0.0024,6.7487,4.3911,6.8492,4.2428,8.5247,4.7523,0.0092,1.9708,9.3611,2.9386,4.1411,7.2915,5.3684,1.2195,9.6512,0.0046,5.8192,3.1917,9.1738,2.1489,10.9797,0.2581,1.8523,10.3765,1.5961,0.0044,4.8352,0.1509,0.0001,2.3228,7.6617,0.1991,0.3556,8.1168,9.7976,10.7472,2.5748,1.5314,1.6808,0.0127,4.9562,0.015,0.0189,3.0594,3.657,3.6653,0.0353,0.8318,0.5519,3.2043,2.2028,5.7272,3.304,2.1421,3.2591,2.2188,1.8472,5.3372,2.3881,4.714,1.445,5.4974,0.9242,1.881,7.315,0.4407,4.9715,0.0118,0.3928,4.31,2.1377,3.6236,2.3267,0.0275,0.5344,0.0236,0.0639,1.5051,2.174,6.9349,0.9408,3.9619,1.6582,4.7123,1.9107,0.0458,2.4033,0.8295,2.1228,0.0067,4.8056,4.211,1.1259,3.611,6.3731,0.0358,2.3716,0.9385,3.6685,1.7855,0.7827,4.7636,1.6245,0.0098,5.0943,0.2346,2.6012,0.0529,2.79,1.8009,3.3228,0.0518,2.2752,0.0225,4.3202,0.8487,1.0733,2.1919,0.7103,1.5858,3.1296,0.9468,4.2791,0.0384,0.7812,2.8861,2.7696,1.5252,5.208,0.6398,2.3876,4.5868,0.5908,1.635,0.875,3.5339,2.4081,3.1005,7.2805,0.1672,1.359,1.6686,1.7738,2.9459,4.3673,1.7094,1.6771,2.5708,2.2709,2.2844,0.6685,4.731,1.6155,1.3216,5.5683,3.8472,3.6568,1.0425,0.8373,1.467,4.8699,0.9261,4.9373,3.2082,0.4326,2.4324,2.3261,2.2107,2.3534,0.6825,0.0916,0.5048,5.0697,7.4291,2.1898,4.6671,4.8172,1.7124,2.7673,4.4239,1.8574,1.0417,0.4126,1.6611,0.0331,0.6116,2.8404,0.6484,0.9931,0.0002,1.1022,2.9974,3.6105,3.2123,1.5023,2.7859,4.1014,1.1351,2.544,0.0065,0.4165,2.0742,2.1288,4.3309,1.0326,3.9511,0.0018,4.6455,5.1742,1.4757,2.3489,3.5945,5.8662,1.1059,3.1656,1.5582,5.9674,0.2099,1.3675,6.3669,0.0263,9.5155,2.2839,5.289,0.5145,1.2516,5.1191,1.6288,1.7698,4.1043,1.3497,1.6306,5.4688,0.9777,4.9277,4.1977,4.3136,1.2204,3.668,3.8031,0.6103,0.9341,3.8904,4.628,5.3335,2.8291,0.4673,5.0022,0.129,1.6896,5.1137,5.5486,0.7797,1.0748,4.6752,0.0121,2.891,0.5308,5.7891,0.3951,2.179,4.8251,4.6906,0.0611,2.4164,9.4696,0.5593,6.868,1.3489,1.6434,0.7658,1.0231,5.6029,1.287,2.0905,2.0495,1.7809,4.9299,2.1569,2.1585,0.5399,4.4459,3.2949,5.2665,0.092,3.2859,4.2325,2.7322,1.6721,1.1435,0.0002,1.1179,2.1418,0.8022,4.4942,0.1637,4.697,3.5203,1.4782,7.05,1.8484,3.1298,0.008,4.1961,0.2989,0.2393,5.2293,6.8759,1.7338,0.0042,0.0195,1.3863,2.9642,1.8997,1.7569,0.0097,1.6487,1.8767,1.8343,6.654,0.4565,0.3309,4.1224,1.4517,1.1845,0.0529,5.1397,0.6911,0.006,0.001,0.726,2.772,2.4334,4.3157,0.0041,0.0658,0.3328,1.7375,0.0002,5.5441]}

The company she operated with spent considerable time on the water, as she had no time out, so she was only allowed to be out for a short time for medical emergencies. Because of the high risk of severe injuries, the firefighting vessels, and other equipment were destroyed in the port siege.\n\nAt this point, the ship and all of her personnel were separated from their families, and only two ships were allowed to remain in Europe (one being built by the British, the other by Russia and the USSR). She was on the air station as a vessel belonging to the SS Lechov, a military aircraft carrier. The Russian fleet consisted of three fighter jets.\n\nAfter the war, in order for the ship to avoid being lost in the service, she was sent to the Russian Federation to fight in World War I. During the war, she was the Russian carrier for the service, as well as the Russian destroyer, the \u0423\u0401\u0410 (She was the second carrier in the Russian navy).\n\nDuring this period, the merchant vessels \u00c2s\u00e2r, \u00c2s\u00e2r, and \u00c2s\u00e2r were destroyed, although the destroyers \u00c2s\u00e2r and \u00c2s\u00e2r served on the fleet.

Water from the river can be served by mowing a patch of lawn, sometimes for the day or evening. Water from the rivers runs straight through to the watercourse, and the soil is moist. There are a lot of little mowing machines and pettifolles, one of which is a 'Garden' machine. Water is heated by the steam of a big boilers, whereupon it is filtered and heated to a maximum temperature as to prevent it becoming hot ; water is also pumped back to the river bank. Water gets absorbed by a mower, which is always on time, and is not harmful for the waterbodies. The area in Hampshire has many garden nurseries and water nurseries. The watercress beds are known to have a good drainage system and flow through the ground or in some places of use, some even to the roof. In Hampshire it is the most fertile farmlands.

The ice only started to lose its shape towards the south by the mid-80's. This was the opposite of what was intended in the previous work to turn to the north.   Also thanks for the correction, I think I missed something. Thanks.\nThere are much better tracks available on the far western bank in Franz Josef Land (I believe is in Schleswig-Holstein ) and south around Wilsdorf.

Thanks for the tip, I think I've added a good half hour to the trip time.\nThey probably did that in the morning between a stop in the town and the ferry from Schleswig-Holstein.","token_len":352,"entropy":[7.7184,3.3019,4.2064,4.3456,8.9174,10.9914,7.9154,4.4823,6.4603,10.6871,5.411,2.4492,10.1137,3.0504,2.5911,8.0624,3.088,2.1119,7.4776,6.1085,12.8332,2.0497,0.0664,6.7417,1.5999,9.9509,4.7864,0.6264,0.5107,7.5899,1.1352,12.4446,3.128,0.722,7.4382,2.94,1.4508,4.5264,4.0784,0.6274,5.7288,7.3615,7.1645,0.6003,0.5214,2.3832,1.1134,4.2808,6.8047,0.1329,0.7694,5.9721,5.1145,5.4311,5.6818,1.4034,5.7496,6.0529,1.9909,3.6503,5.5335,0.0006,2.7149,0.3899,0.7548,5.2627,2.1606,2.4082,2.7444,4.2479,2.2228,3.3392,6.376,2.2394,5.3199,2.2044,5.2874,4.7136,3.8368,4.8852,0.5047,3.642,0.2985,2.7801,0.747,2.2695,9.5508,3.5514,4.6665,0.1047,0.01,0.0561,0.4086,0.0407,3.193,0.0951,0.0322,0.0014,0.002,0.0062,0.0007,0.0112,0.0173,0.0044,0.0059,0.0004,0.0007,0.0301,0.0015,0.0006,0.001,0.0019,0.0138,0.0003,0.0011,0.0014,0.0012,0.0009,0.0029,0.0022,0.0012,0.0005,0.0014,13.4424,5.8789,7.258,1.8204,5.4423,0.7062,1.9593,2.4838,6.0686,4.7529,0.6717,5.3794,1.6422,3.172,5.9423,0.3774,2.1107,4.2252,1.1866,3.8381,0.607,4.6942,1.376,1.2094,3.5512,1.8064,2.7275,5.1924,0.2587,0.96,1.986,4.7658,3.165,0.677,4.2829,6.0659,4.7415,5.9164,4.8472,1.4551,1.2217,1.2966,4.2674,1.9726,5.1682,0.3732,6.3269,0.7696,6.5288,2.8333,3.1063,2.0122,3.7167,3.3889,1.8376,0.915,4.3805,2.2777,1.4167,5.5692,1.55,6.6299,1.9966,7.8768,4.7485,2.0345,1.0323,7.0594,5.2096,6.0056,4.1963,6.5395,0.039,0.0079,0.6292,2.7975,4.4032,3.8864,6.4456,3.0039,6.0938,1.8023,0.0392,0.5165,0.0002,0.0001,6.1918,2.2364,5.6474,7.7012,4.7807,5.1486,2.8121,0.0162,1.7675,2.6893,3.462,3.0944,4.0661,0.9433,3.2988,2.1443,1.29,3.871,3.0543,7.2598,7.1176,5.2196,2.898,1.6719,1.3263,2.7465,3.6437,3.3401,2.726,3.3378,4.0363,0.0737,0.1336,4.387,3.0529,2.3923,0.5037,5.6286,3.512,5.5759,0.9331,0.6112,4.9439,1.2772,1.6417,6.865,0.7179,5.8782,0.5194,6.3873,2.2303,2.2522,4.2333,4.6045,0.0497,3.708,1.17,6.3001,5.4571,6.4877,2.1924,2.5446,4.3768,5.1374,0.0079,6.4573,4.8625,4.953,1.4985,3.27,6.0332,0.2059,2.4639,0.4696,1.7093,3.4798,3.8339,0.0009,2.1094,1.0498,4.2705,0.7251,4.0581,0.2592,3.9549,4.0969,3.3378,6.1461,0.0012,3.0374,4.7858,2.2515,6.0103,1.1789,4.8318,5.7701,2.2815,3.1148,6.3656,1.1086,1.2711,3.5605,1.9286,2.5516,3.4396,1.6014,3.2222,4.8148,1.0424,3.4749,4.4591,1.1853,1.4595,1.3325,1.4734,7.5197,0.8748,1.1484,6.6882,5.0757,3.8116,4.7644,3.2569,1.3196,3.8401,7.7405,5.3293,5.2703,1.3923,1.6282,4.3272,1.6528,2.0144,5.0868,4.5062,2.4145,0.0225,0.0237,1.3488,0.0218,0.0059,1.1195]}
{"id":4811,"ended":true,"length":290,"text":"During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States initially supported the royal government of Yugoslavia. When the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia in the spring of 1941, the United States decisively supported the government of Yugoslav President Slomo\u010di\u0107. The first anti-Soviet attack on Yugoslavia, the Second Intifada, against Soviet troops came from an alliance of European nations, allied forces from Europe and the U.S. (see \"The Fourth Intifada\"). Later, with the help of American allies allied with Hitler and Soviet troops, the U.S. became very involved in Kosovo and became a significant and major ally in later conflicts.\n\nIn 1965, General St. J\u00e1bri had left the United States to serve the Republic of Kosovo as an observer and was a major player in the peace negotiations between the United States and Yugoslavia. The conflict between the two countries involved the U.S. involvement in the liberation of Yugoslavia.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1973\u201374, the U.S. was again active in the Kosovo Liberation Front, a self-styled antigovernment wing known as \"the Democratic Communists.\" Following the United States invasion or withdrawal of Yugoslavia from the war, and the war in Kosovo, the Democratic Communist Party took its share of the blame for the failure of the U.S. government's response to the ethnic cleansing of ethnic Albanians in their country.\n\nSee also\n\nMilitary leadership in Yugoslavia\nU.S. involvement in the Kosovo conflict\nForeign relations of Yugoslavia\n\nReferences\n\n\n,.\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\n \"United States- Yugoslav Wars: The Struggle for the Right to Freedom\" by Marder, Krak\u00f3w.com, August 7, 2009,.","token_len":352,"entropy":[7.8996,0.0468,0.2951,5.4116,6.8916,0.3489,1.9022,3.681,0.0953,6.9348,3.1015,0.9184,10.9862,4.5518,0.6849,1.9019,1.6454,4.4215,0.9077,3.9228,0.542,1.7552,0.53,4.4177,1.834,0.0194,1.1396,0.1232,0.8477,0.6693,0.007,8.5076,2.3627,0.4739,1.5374,0.3378,4.4184,1.0063,1.1821,14.534,14.0863,2.7222,0.0044,0.8777,1.8523,5.0004,6.8142,0.0512,2.7679,6.1874,1.013,0.3737,3.7849,2.2556,4.5421,4.4223,0.0296,0.0015,0.4325,6.4237,3.2104,1.2646,5.1754,3.3354,5.1251,2.7877,0.9761,5.2355,2.5854,1.78,6.4553,4.8462,2.7188,4.2519,1.3076,1.2697,4.0906,0.004,0.0237,0.3586,3.9344,2.6105,2.8522,2.1335,6.8587,0.7052,0.0002,0.0099,1.2302,5.4707,0.6271,4.7426,0.3597,3.6229,0.0028,3.9998,3.5647,6.1181,0.8413,3.4395,1.8053,4.099,2.9738,0.4658,0.5035,2.2433,0.0006,0.0023,0.0549,4.3807,5.0854,2.3835,0.1952,6.0578,1.6831,5.4445,1.8511,4.948,5.2692,4.5354,1.7837,1.0652,7.0967,2.1311,1.1709,1.3666,0.0026,2.1721,5.9121,0.2831,5.3405,6.4841,3.2449,6.9961,7.4457,6.167,4.1399,5.6737,6.683,1.0062,0.8919,0.0172,1.1752,3.4856,4.1741,4.7982,0.0429,2.2629,2.3719,2.4336,4.4619,2.5649,4.3427,4.3073,3.7261,2.8966,0.0939,0.5526,3.2844,1.7142,1.4463,0.4514,1.7761,0.0341,0.0881,2.5467,0.3034,2.6076,5.4574,1.9461,0.6517,2.2455,0.8217,4.3242,1.6242,3.6744,0.0008,0.0064,0.169,3.0332,0.1983,1.0478,4.5665,0.0488,3.5263,1.6301,2.2748,0.0002,3.62,0.7051,1.8527,2.902,1.279,3.7315,8.1678,0.423,0.1663,0.7879,1.5791,0.0004,0.0017,0.0665,2.7417,4.8411,3.2706,0.1656,0.9483,3.7122,2.4765,2.762,1.5199,2.2076,4.5287,0.0395,2.8839,0.0006,7.2238,0.7882,0.0,6.6124,7.2769,0.3275,2.9989,2.3933,4.5955,7.9931,0.8572,4.7242,0.3103,5.1703,0.1955,2.5862,7.8512,2.1746,0.7994,2.6471,1.7322,0.4239,3.1819,0.6277,5.0653,1.2719,4.7321,2.3667,1.4254,0.4892,0.5689,3.1467,2.6429,0.4057,3.8898,4.6845,6.3729,0.016,3.1923,2.5891,0.5163,0.3902,4.4309,0.2463,0.3999,2.3598,0.0005,0.0024,0.2695,2.5291,2.315,3.5376,0.5965,0.2738,5.0527,0.2854,0.8169,2.4416,0.3415,0.2936,1.3633,5.5463,2.6027,0.9522,1.2429,0.0003,6.7041,0.7529,1.643,0.0003,6.9989,6.7321,2.5461,3.1989,0.8761,20.133,0.1225,0.009,0.1343,2.922,0.0588,1.3665,2.0377,1.9713,0.5985,24.3348,3.2359,3.1226,2.1732,0.5895,0.0006,4.9221,5.4318,0.0005,13.8298,2.5875,0.0003,6.3676,1.334,0.0004,5.1839,0.3434,2.7342,11.8234,3.6148,0.1804,2.9267,9.3203,4.6517,1.8082,2.2421,5.4283,0.5257,2.0601,3.627,0.4214,5.2635,2.5184,1.0434,5.461,6.7594,2.2382,1.3857,5.0735,7.2086,1.6658,0.3297,2.7556,6.5662,1.3507,3.0179,4.1952,0.1306,3.4075,8.6485]}

Tucker, Jr. the following year, changed her name to Gee Tucker, moved back to New Orleans, and became a businessperson.Gee spent most of her days working as an accountant in a restaurant in New Orleans, Louisiana, and retired in 1999, while working as a security guard for the U.S. State Department as well as the New York City Police Department.She did not intend to leave the city and moved back to New Orleans for good, however, in April, 2016, she decided to become a freelance writer and became a journalist and social media consultant. She is one of the few women in New Orleans who has worked for the newspaper and had never held a job that was as lucrative in her life.\n\nDuring the early to mid to late 1980s, Michelle was in charge of a number of restaurants in New Orleans with their own chef. Although much effort was made to produce quality food, in many cases the restaurant would not be profitable in most areas, and a shortage of food and food ingredients meant that the restaurant also would not have enough supplies to meet the growing demand. She was, however, very passionate about the restaurant business and began to create her own recipes for food, including her own food magazines.Her initial success in this business was the success of numerous restaurants in her home state of Louisiana. She had also worked as a freelance journalist before leaving New Orleans in the late 1980s.\n\nShe retired and moved home to visit her family in Boston, Massachusetts., where she continued to do freelance articles for several decades. Since 1993, Michelle has been working as both a newspaper reporter and an entrepreneur in her home state of Massachusetts.\n\nReferences","token_len":353,"entropy":[12.1228,0.0626,11.573,9.9247,3.2308,3.8177,5.574,0.2085,7.7068,5.8384,4.9211,4.4878,1.4304,6.7964,0.948,5.1227,0.9818,5.3173,2.5233,0.2558,1.7029,9.9889,1.0563,0.5843,0.364,6.0075,4.9172,5.0873,1.3037,6.2187,2.9332,0.5164,2.6242,2.5541,0.85,0.369,3.451,1.2153,5.3506,4.3432,1.0395,8.355,0.0651,7.4458,2.4758,0.011,0.433,4.3916,2.4045,1.6603,1.9108,3.2683,2.2839,2.8624,4.1615,1.1407,2.483,0.0975,1.0097,6.7124,0.6747,1.6586,7.0495,1.0994,3.9742,1.9304,4.8711,2.5148,1.0312,0.4641,5.0036,0.1108,1.7827,1.3386,4.0499,0.0188,0.0261,0.0256,5.5448,0.1012,4.8851,1.5945,0.1438,2.4321,4.6638,0.8902,1.505,0.51,0.0173,0.2495,3.3642,5.1176,0.5019,6.5198,0.1592,2.3455,1.0022,3.172,2.8745,2.0814,1.0876,0.1552,0.9158,0.0255,3.6391,3.1043,1.4923,4.2141,0.4809,1.9479,5.38,3.6728,5.083,0.437,0.5905,4.2198,0.1649,3.7995,0.4288,4.9759,1.0046,1.8739,4.1048,0.9644,4.8091,3.9582,4.8318,1.5993,2.8439,0.54,1.7898,2.9488,4.7998,0.0199,0.6951,2.146,1.475,1.2003,2.2457,0.0734,1.0911,1.0317,3.1709,1.9613,1.6921,4.9422,1.9298,5.6904,5.2947,5.4285,0.6789,1.3152,4.8044,2.1083,4.1068,0.9886,3.5413,2.0622,1.5919,1.5437,3.6877,0.0049,5.9585,1.4449,4.098,5.8248,0.0879,4.26,0.0428,2.3177,0.2199,0.2677,1.6797,1.7991,3.4964,4.8957,0.0284,1.9754,4.0173,0.0014,5.0222,1.1328,0.6495,0.0144,4.3373,5.3189,1.579,5.7493,1.4504,5.2101,6.1777,6.4794,0.3717,1.8232,0.2231,5.9604,3.4775,0.973,0.7212,4.6681,2.987,0.3891,1.7424,3.5376,3.8615,1.0816,2.0155,4.3682,3.0803,5.66,2.544,2.2136,1.5166,4.4335,4.7115,0.0633,2.4786,3.0576,4.0771,4.6953,2.5779,0.5575,1.6997,1.8687,6.4918,3.0103,0.4864,2.1149,0.9805,6.5074,0.8541,1.1185,1.0664,3.0735,0.3035,1.2004,3.0687,1.8514,5.6998,0.6913,0.0054,3.5853,4.6946,0.1075,1.6417,2.1589,1.509,0.5178,3.6997,0.8832,3.8475,2.198,0.028,3.2208,1.9369,3.1529,2.0298,3.3857,2.5815,0.3086,4.4151,5.9069,1.03,6.0331,5.1302,2.5022,2.18,3.1549,2.1694,1.7047,4.2101,1.367,0.1169,6.8633,2.5006,1.6644,3.8903,2.7622,1.402,0.7124,0.4452,1.2192,1.7611,3.2861,3.269,2.4818,1.4971,0.3238,4.3843,1.8705,4.5555,3.2955,1.4085,0.0061,2.1867,2.8821,1.538,0.4266,0.0603,1.3107,1.2034,0.0001,3.2216,6.3337,4.8125,1.4687,5.5742,0.6285,8.4139,0.2037,0.7494,0.8935,5.8243,0.7893,0.4826,7.8033,1.1523,0.15,2.1944,0.6899,3.6189,1.914,4.6903,1.5262,3.3322,4.619,0.43,5.5487,5.6994,0.2246,1.7721,0.2724,1.2411,2.3217,0.9877,5.7724,0.2759,6.0771,1.3164,0.1993,2.6083,4.8589,2.2425,2.2233,0.6931,0.0778,0.68,3.4373,0.3673,1.316,0.0002,5.019]}

The most notable feature of these forms was the addition of the chakra (or sh\u014dkaku) into the chakra of the class.\n\nSh\u014dkaku 9 became Sh\u014dkaku 13 when the name of the class Sh\u014dkaku was changed to Sh\u014dkaku 9 because the chakra of the class was not in the same range of its waterline belts as previously planned ( Sh\u014dkaku 19 was originally a waterline belt).\n\nAccording to the Sh\u014dkoku 8 code, the chakra is in the same range of a typical Sh\u014dkaku belt. Sh\u014dkaku 19 was initially assumed to have a waterline belt that had been constructed using water for water flow. However, Sh\u014dkaku 20 was originally conceived of the waterline belt as a waterline; however, this is only the waterline for Sh\u016bkaku 21. Sh\u016bkaku 2 was originally originally intended for the waterline belt although this appears to have been dropped due to being a more practical shape and design of the waterline belts. Sh\u016bkaku 3 was added to Sh\u016bkaku 5 to allow the belt to be longer and thus allow water into a larger diameter.\n\nReferences\n\nSources","token_len":353,"entropy":[8.3739,8.9343,3.6074,2.7115,7.0594,5.3408,2.1879,9.1458,5.8165,8.1658,1.9413,6.539,0.0452,9.6328,7.5826,0.1411,1.789,10.9573,13.5003,6.5938,9.4878,5.43,5.141,2.5006,1.138,12.8303,9.1632,7.504,7.4079,10.1184,10.6784,10.7375,1.4174,3.2794,6.4327,4.6322,3.2527,9.4113,3.5567,7.1814,6.6233,2.9308,2.4646,8.2768,0.3756,0.0681,0.007,3.1862,5.328,3.498,6.1698,1.1405,2.9365,0.2583,0.1754,0.0649,6.7061,3.5066,4.6305,1.0726,3.0897,6.077,4.9462,4.7476,2.9781,2.1802,1.5207,4.1892,3.4431,1.5459,0.6503,1.6433,0.6884,0.1248,0.0461,0.1014,0.0081,1.9134,2.1023,1.3343,3.8331,4.3481,5.7327,0.0161,5.8913,2.5026,3.1858,2.1569,6.2147,2.7099,4.3075,3.1973,5.2553,0.0296,0.0268,0.0021,2.9837,5.3219,0.7401,1.8373,1.9935,2.9577,5.7727,0.4645,1.342,1.797,0.8305,0.5652,3.5172,0.0032,2.1596,6.4184,1.6301,3.6851,3.4253,3.8276,0.6157,1.7434,0.2709,0.6367,4.5592,0.3114,4.2399,0.0953,2.4087,0.7137,6.3065,1.2846,2.1357,0.0003,2.2703,0.0833,0.0519,0.0111,2.5936,5.3409,2.3726,0.059,0.0555,0.0078,4.6993,2.3513,1.4511,5.8225,1.8816,0.4666,1.0721,8.3513,0.097,0.0705,0.0172,1.0753,0.4185,0.4199,0.1699,0.0262,0.0459,0.0061,3.2406,5.0605,1.8597,2.4243,0.1058,1.8886,0.5207,0.4199,0.7891,2.8252,3.8876,1.1942,2.4311,6.2633,1.7497,3.3557,8.8558,0.0517,4.1615,1.4649,5.1146,4.9974,3.3681,3.8207,0.059,0.0361,0.0042,4.6573,3.8602,2.9033,3.616,3.4024,0.0905,0.1125,3.3874,1.0734,0.0003,5.8382,0.0067,1.3849,1.6384,0.0925,0.0578,8.7062,7.2915,5.7709,0.5333,1.1842,2.8989,0.0559,3.1733,3.6974,0.5587,1.4572,0.8756,0.5914,4.1249,5.168,3.0138,0.0073,0.0151,0.0234,2.2405,1.8834,3.3114,0.0405,0.011,0.0621,4.6576,1.4553,2.9929,6.3508,0.0854,1.8032,1.4007,1.934,0.0191,0.1577,1.6164,2.3323,2.7589,4.2998,2.6045,4.5194,5.7044,4.1333,3.417,1.4616,1.2937,0.0657,3.2664,0.0101,0.0081,0.0054,3.6251,0.8952,1.823,5.1611,2.4048,7.7002,2.2404,0.0769,0.199,0.6508,1.7073,2.7155,0.2185,8.6615,1.9033,0.0351,2.3102,3.0447,3.9008,2.0736,6.2301,0.0558,5.5718,1.9097,7.5466,1.2409,0.1306,3.522,0.8882,2.8394,2.1826,0.0187,0.0014,5.3764,0.977,0.5259,5.0902,1.107,2.355,2.0208,1.5317,0.0364,0.3633,8.2402,2.4658,6.0927,0.104,0.2908,0.4451,3.843,2.3495,0.0016,6.3383,3.2517,3.3815,2.6715,5.3578,2.9799,3.1318,3.7068,0.5695,3.0104,0.0548,4.3184,0.5651,1.9184,0.7889,0.0092,0.0009,0.6015,0.5045,7.269,0.7574,1.1472,1.825,0.0135,0.0005,3.5922,2.1558,2.1516,1.7034,4.2176,0.1205,0.561,5.7344,1.1635,3.8756,2.3592,4.424,5.8191,3.7495,3.0502,4.2007,0.7436,1.0996,0.0002,4.0307,2.1639,0.0007,6.1087]}

A number of top names had approached him; the UK version of The Beatles Live Tour had been released in May 2008, but was shelved due to budget concerns. On 1 July 2008, Syco and Johnston appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and discussed their respective career goals. Johnston had said that the Beatles should use the song 'Trougsy and the Bissette as a kind of tribute to T. Bissette in his song 'Sledgehammer''. Following Johnston's death a few days later, Syco decided to sell him to Warner Music for the rest of his life.\n\nDuring this time, Johnston was also very heavily involved in the Beatles music industry. During an interview given shortly before his death in 2009, Johnston revealed that he and his British producer, Terry Williams, had a real rivalry and he always sought to keep it close to me.\n\nDiscography\n\nSingles\n \"Trougsy\" (1999)\n \"Sledgehammer\" (2001)\n \"Trougsy\" (2002)\n \"Sledgehammer\" (2003)\n \"Trougsy\" (2004)\n \"Sledgehammer\" (05)\n \"Trougsy and the Bissette (Part II)\" (2008)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nSyco Music UK","token_len":354,"entropy":[7.6897,3.0706,4.5334,0.4374,5.5415,10.5382,0.7384,4.7789,1.8275,2.0724,9.389,1.4159,6.666,0.0161,8.3891,5.5003,0.8444,4.8081,0.4285,2.5317,0.2539,3.6174,1.0212,3.5222,0.9085,5.8563,0.2493,0.3384,7.4637,4.7164,1.8804,2.0695,1.6526,3.7743,0.053,2.2818,1.3684,7.3706,2.8572,2.8175,0.0513,0.1605,3.5949,1.0072,1.4624,2.3071,4.5489,1.5632,4.1345,3.5488,0.9752,0.55,0.7597,6.7912,2.7234,5.3848,0.3812,1.0624,4.3007,3.4699,3.2491,1.0426,0.8232,0.9313,1.5186,7.5231,2.1926,3.1343,0.0063,1.1527,2.3075,3.0112,6.2152,2.0421,3.4447,5.819,4.5181,3.391,0.3927,5.1571,3.8823,0.0038,6.5607,3.7942,3.504,6.0952,2.6316,6.2377,2.9099,4.4385,5.2565,0.1224,2.3859,1.6867,5.7873,0.4594,1.9317,1.2273,3.5259,0.9726,3.3494,1.2754,1.5353,2.8129,2.529,4.2656,0.001,2.5304,0.0036,3.9248,2.216,0.4474,3.9687,3.5839,1.0202,0.2843,0.0855,2.778,0.0013,5.3282,3.1197,5.4697,1.5622,1.3967,4.8748,0.022,1.06,2.0351,0.0003,1.0248,1.9451,4.8569,2.0643,4.4818,5.073,3.8385,1.0864,2.489,3.3281,3.9467,0.9603,2.6261,3.8592,3.7199,5.3449,1.7405,4.6765,2.4996,5.1786,2.2982,10.2499,10.9043,3.6191,2.6035,4.6533,8.8152,4.1694,7.0986,0.8132,4.8735,0.0027,3.7138,0.3979,5.8343,1.3924,7.2445,4.9531,0.0123,5.2269,2.7668,2.6119,0.5864,4.8758,7.8693,0.0702,10.3845,5.2101,2.5,0.0216,3.8564,5.7562,2.5298,1.0395,0.1111,0.1954,2.2149,0.0014,5.2003,0.3177,4.2436,5.0818,4.0816,1.4597,2.3816,1.5526,3.6647,3.4871,0.0012,0.5295,0.1218,0.6371,1.2425,0.0078,4.4342,1.9353,0.761,0.2137,1.243,1.853,2.8615,5.6232,6.9367,0.0778,0.2845,1.1037,5.0456,3.8864,1.9476,0.8288,3.4114,4.18,0.2458,5.6301,6.0952,0.764,0.8706,0.2006,1.7617,3.1134,0.2265,0.7604,3.0087,0.3678,0.464,3.6715,1.0934,6.5225,2.7023,2.1491,6.2578,5.3358,0.2852,0.5917,3.1241,6.7102,4.7185,2.9653,3.6899,5.9079,5.1965,0.6731,3.5094,2.4165,4.2781,1.0456,9.1277,0.4143,2.7866,0.0002,9.0821,0.0427,0.8816,0.0001,7.2253,0.3071,0.3721,12.4039,2.4355,0.0761,0.0968,0.3749,3.0855,1.5631,4.3034,0.1818,0.891,11.4993,2.2895,0.0281,0.0013,0.0576,0.0416,2.3252,0.0244,0.5527,11.0195,1.9762,0.2028,0.1847,0.3679,0.5808,0.0521,1.1607,0.0195,0.612,11.2037,2.1213,0.1353,0.0055,0.0465,0.0209,0.3642,0.0077,0.4588,10.9478,0.9912,0.0327,0.0132,0.047,0.0527,0.0267,0.2849,0.006,0.423,10.6748,1.6307,0.0135,0.0011,0.0217,0.0087,6.1405,0.4437,0.4516,10.4775,0.8721,0.038,0.0073,0.0268,5.7621,0.1894,0.2714,0.008,0.0046,4.1115,5.5653,2.193,0.4038,0.1698,3.1523,0.0192,0.2428,0.0002,4.8863,0.8908,0.0003,5.3676,0.2939,1.0659,0.0004,5.937,0.0036,0.468,4.5654]}

Brazil also will participate in an innovation competition on transportation infrastructure that will have an impact in Brazil and Argentina.\nBrazil will work to implement its national infrastructure strategy for the first time at the Olympic Games at a scale that ensures good customer service while guaranteeing the quality of service offered to more than 7 million people worldwide.\nUnder the project, the Brazilian government will pay for a period of five years to develop its infrastructure. The construction of the Brazilian Olympic Centres will give Brazil a leading seat at the Games and for the world to experience some of the most promising technologies in the world. Brazil will also have a network connecting the country with the world.\nThe Olympic Facilities Centres will be part of Brazil's transportation network that has an estimated total value of $3.3 billion. The aim is to bring more capacity on and off-campus to enable more Brazilian residents to move from one place to another.\nThe Rio Games would serve as a showcase for the technical and business development of the Olympic Games between a host country and its international partner.\n\u2013IANS\nmbh\/rrm","token_len":354,"entropy":[7.9714,3.2472,0.1333,4.2191,7.1003,2.7698,9.0089,1.0274,5.8657,5.8833,0.7018,5.4107,9.0388,3.9774,0.9009,4.0152,3.432,0.584,4.4988,3.4083,0.1611,0.0156,2.9198,5.0039,11.1572,5.9962,4.5957,2.4515,1.2548,12.2465,3.976,3.1383,3.7278,0.5581,6.1366,0.7133,0.7421,0.0167,5.4787,7.7798,3.3833,3.4139,0.8098,5.3924,0.9179,0.515,2.699,4.4109,1.7155,0.0088,2.9151,2.3163,2.7097,4.2077,2.5832,6.9352,2.3252,0.404,1.3183,3.8416,1.1839,0.3102,0.6029,0.7659,0.3256,14.368,2.3187,5.5755,0.4867,5.4599,2.6783,1.8239,2.4089,1.5243,3.8651,1.0534,2.1376,1.098,6.1134,2.7305,1.4441,2.7402,0.899,2.7834,0.0997,3.4653,1.8863,5.8571,3.0035,0.3334,0.6684,3.8677,4.974,4.4893,0.5899,2.8704,2.7437,0.7152,2.8705,5.089,1.4081,1.7339,3.2891,2.0664,7.1437,2.8708,6.1084,0.3792,1.3288,1.3768,0.1865,1.4076,7.1366,3.121,5.4412,1.7545,4.0761,1.7017,1.2586,3.0327,0.2515,4.0099,4.4935,2.9423,3.096,4.6407,4.0012,2.0118,2.9513,6.0795,1.209,2.85,3.5327,1.4563,4.7299,3.0925,2.8016,2.9834,0.0351,2.7493,5.4519,4.2935,3.5746,6.1256,1.6391,3.5335,0.3823,5.2421,2.3341,1.04,3.6712,4.028,2.7132,7.8857,0.8616,0.3894,2.5074,1.6865,4.7401,2.1751,4.2274,2.5446,3.8256,2.0001,3.0674,3.0903,1.045,5.5419,0.2235,3.9725,0.4486,5.3738,0.2514,4.9844,4.5064,5.3897,1.1423,4.6389,5.9362,6.0808,1.1279,5.4792,6.7006,1.629,3.4819,0.2694,2.5766,3.6806,1.5892,7.1426,0.7157,4.3923,0.9338,1.9215,2.5826,0.38,0.6012,6.5351,0.4022,4.5982,0.293,1.3044,1.9369,1.1033,0.4627,4.8036,1.2851,2.7212,6.5936,0.0878,3.3497,0.0833,1.3728,2.4883,3.5767,0.9658,2.3058,1.4073,4.4069,0.6605,1.2041,4.7909,2.6161,7.7142,2.2685,1.7089,6.766,2.6025,1.5889,5.0108,5.068,1.6362,0.1529,3.5389,1.8687,5.0886,0.9187,4.5902,2.1765,3.109,5.9219,0.1152,0.1648,1.9523,5.3075,4.7855,1.756,0.6787,0.5402,0.384,3.9755,0.7558,0.9034,4.0017,1.4349,5.5995,6.0843,1.4607,2.9913,1.8368,1.3476,1.4795,2.1503,0.5638,1.4211,4.4179,9.4318,7.7467,0.0359,0.7761,1.0307,4.2253,0.0012,2.8958,0.022,5.6969,1.6693,2.5525,4.5011,4.0441,2.3045,5.0372,4.6024,0.0356,1.115,3.1949,0.4126,2.3121,0.3,0.8308,1.2819,6.5332,0.7143,0.0855,3.7693,3.5619,3.1401,4.5339,4.4817,0.3617,2.4933,5.5928,1.4658,5.1547,1.6971,5.7383,3.3198,0.1319,4.1177,2.4929,0.823,1.8248,0.1202,0.1908,0.9071,0.864,1.3993,4.2861,4.2206,5.5215,4.8821,0.2265,0.5772,3.6983,0.4018,0.9858,6.4314,2.1927,3.9206,3.2504,1.0602,0.7765,2.5874,1.0237,7.0552,5.4002,2.2856,0.7143,0.2041,2.4772,3.0966,3.8141,1.0476,1.4603,6.466,8.6201,1.0688,2.0607,10.8285,3.335,3.9053,8.6288,4.2762]}

Sullivan of the New York Times and John Wiley and Sons were named readers.\n\nIn 1938, the American Public Broadcasting Company began advertising Mr. Norman, in which he was known for his portrayal of a British circus master and his play of the same name.\n\nIn October 1938, the American Board of Directors of the New York Public Broadcasting Company announced that George Norman had contracted throat cancer.\n\nThe company was to pay to Norman's family for the cancer.\n\nThe cancer had come to an end with Norman's death during a routine period in his final months as a circus director.  The report by the board revealed in depth that the company knew that Mr. Norman had been contracted to perform a full circle act known as \"Crown of the Circles\", and that it had paid only $1,000 and $2,000 per year for the remainder of the life of the circus.\n\nNorman's work, including that performed in \"Crown of the Circles\" in 1938, was shown in New York at the New York Center for the Performing Arts until 1957. In 1957, Mr. Norman was inducted into the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n*A tribute to the late Norman (June 25, 1941 \u2013 September 14, 2005) in the Wall Street Journal","token_len":354,"entropy":[9.8848,8.404,2.707,8.5694,0.0949,1.8956,7.3276,2.5288,8.0717,1.7732,6.2282,2.7881,0.0046,1.3168,1.4766,6.2645,4.2186,0.4138,7.8122,2.3165,0.4453,2.4515,6.3453,0.9992,3.2689,13.0991,8.4674,8.7542,4.4439,3.4362,5.467,4.5672,5.9671,2.8089,6.0593,0.0173,5.4507,6.6962,2.6249,5.9671,3.6396,1.1412,1.7479,4.2952,1.6305,2.0434,3.9007,0.3292,2.0596,0.0401,2.2901,6.5397,2.1509,5.4588,6.415,1.5325,0.9211,7.4028,0.2138,0.0321,1.456,1.6135,1.673,3.8622,6.3028,4.2502,4.8255,0.8807,0.0638,2.881,7.0958,3.4123,5.7617,2.4014,4.7629,4.9567,3.6839,0.2707,6.9714,4.0978,1.1787,1.1921,0.084,0.9111,1.7567,3.4202,5.9671,1.2646,0.0012,2.4763,4.7101,8.1917,1.4823,0.856,0.0003,2.5472,3.6704,0.9727,2.0568,4.6309,5.6292,2.2174,0.5707,4.33,3.7165,5.0471,1.3819,0.3273,3.5349,3.9676,2.7722,1.1886,1.5749,4.445,2.5559,0.5673,4.4509,0.0458,2.1368,5.5274,3.1087,5.2199,2.6954,1.6127,5.8397,3.7732,1.5955,3.2589,0.0285,0.8526,1.0695,0.0003,1.987,3.8819,1.0258,0.3015,1.687,3.17,4.6622,0.0685,4.595,2.2185,0.3464,1.6277,0.0297,2.7582,1.0968,0.8067,2.8574,0.9125,6.2883,0.181,1.8402,7.2442,6.9327,0.0081,1.1118,1.0489,0.0003,2.1758,4.1391,3.072,4.7571,2.849,6.0244,2.4421,2.7764,1.9313,2.8241,1.1584,4.2395,2.5372,0.9961,0.0002,1.9821,3.8398,2.2673,5.5927,1.0583,3.3096,0.0268,3.7694,3.4728,0.6931,0.2413,6.307,1.1047,3.9263,6.9904,1.6092,1.9236,7.6663,2.5745,3.5355,0.3187,1.2524,2.3756,0.5625,12.1511,7.2217,6.1711,5.2864,0.6608,1.8703,4.5845,5.6337,6.7311,2.1666,1.786,4.4469,4.5627,1.9041,2.1879,0.01,0.0196,1.0091,1.9685,5.4914,1.8078,0.7755,2.6193,5.774,6.1743,5.2679,5.6073,0.0248,1.8156,4.1141,4.1558,2.4372,1.506,8.1542,0.8581,3.0885,2.5763,1.0026,2.3295,1.4228,3.1675,5.6727,0.873,2.4544,0.3837,0.8887,5.1482,1.7621,1.0958,0.0023,0.4671,3.3429,1.9023,0.8895,0.9016,5.3125,0.1228,1.1069,3.4517,0.2737,1.1456,3.487,1.9591,0.5314,0.0003,4.4954,0.0011,1.4026,5.219,3.9755,3.4081,4.7678,3.5964,1.898,5.4747,0.6066,0.0421,0.1427,0.0308,0.1245,0.0028,1.112,2.2954,2.1815,0.3005,0.9611,4.8356,1.045,3.9647,0.0248,3.7056,0.5261,2.532,0.2765,7.0265,0.3149,0.8631,1.2226,0.0031,0.0024,4.8689,5.7876,0.5771,3.1316,2.9462,0.4404,2.8763,0.0089,0.0614,1.247,2.7927,0.001,0.1149,0.044,2.2464,3.6603,1.9563,0.5411,0.6933,0.0007,0.0032,1.5694,1.7639,0.5402,0.0002,6.602,1.1985,0.0006,6.9275,0.7575,0.8029,0.0004,5.6718,4.671,7.2537,0.3764,2.0504,2.5409,1.4726,5.2192,7.1314,4.2605,0.0717,4.3134,3.1031,2.9825,3.8491,0.0023,5.2098,0.8369,3.6025,1.1375,2.339,0.0051,0.0014]}
{"id":2140,"ended":false,"length":323,"text":"In December 1999, Lester Crown and his family agreed to sponsor a water feature in Millennium Park. Unlike other park feature sponsors, the Crowns acted independently of Millennium Park officials ; they were hired by Millennium Park to fill a gap. The area was intended to be home to the Millennium Park water feature, but its original plan of replacing an existing water feature failed, and in 1998 an announcement was made that it did not meet Millennium Park\u2019s water features program goal. The Millennium Park plan was for a water feature in Millennium Park, but the Crowns did not understand why and did not want to invest.\n\nIn early 2001, due to the high traffic in Millennium Park, Millennium Park had set a new water feature requirement that would have had the opposite effect because the Crowns had only replaced the water feature. After several years of research, at Millennium Park, a replacement was chosen. The water feature was to be built next to the Millennium Park picnic table and in the parking garage.\n\nIn August 2001, Crowns finally purchased Millennium Park and built a new water feature. The new water feature was to have a capacity of 12,000 square feet, or 8,500 cubic feet, but it failed to meet the Millennium Park water feature requirements. Millennium Park was allocated to the Crowns for approximately $50,000, which was in addition to $15,000 in Millennium Park costs.\n\nThe Crowns wanted Millennium Park to use another replacement water feature that would have a capacity of 14,000 square feet and a maximum of 36,000 square feet of space. However, as with most parks, Millennium Park was not equipped for the potential demand for a water feature.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n Millennium Park Community Relations","token_len":355,"entropy":[8.2777,5.6134,0.1699,9.501,7.1746,3.338,2.0265,2.9031,5.3848,0.0629,8.6836,0.9371,8.9999,6.88,1.5939,9.8067,0.3408,1.3575,7.6025,2.375,3.9402,4.6244,2.9077,0.3439,1.2472,2.8183,1.0205,8.6178,3.1435,1.7182,5.7046,0.0816,3.473,12.621,1.4053,2.1397,4.4051,0.5868,2.0002,0.0814,1.4638,5.9225,2.4912,3.9663,3.278,1.9799,6.8078,1.2971,5.548,0.4494,0.75,3.8922,0.0827,1.9121,3.1706,1.1483,5.7124,1.6889,1.2291,0.977,4.1319,4.6732,2.3773,4.9836,4.2367,5.0515,1.4947,1.7347,0.1907,4.8785,2.6343,1.302,3.7147,4.5671,4.8063,5.3083,0.6898,0.2024,1.0104,2.6658,5.8823,0.0664,2.9739,2.0549,0.0053,15.3379,8.3645,3.2018,2.2308,5.0765,5.0731,5.5245,0.6623,1.5275,3.9831,0.0952,4.5988,1.0728,5.8599,1.3926,2.0445,0.0995,2.6546,1.7626,0.0538,1.5564,0.618,1.4603,1.1372,0.4447,2.4762,0.0276,5.9435,2.2899,4.5777,1.5684,0.0236,2.8375,0.2495,4.1891,3.8202,2.0462,0.0074,1.8615,3.6654,2.7148,0.1417,8.0716,0.1016,1.6662,4.4657,5.9361,2.6391,1.4606,0.0137,0.3704,2.9819,0.0296,4.3242,6.3427,2.6014,2.7367,0.8833,0.235,4.3449,3.0403,1.318,2.039,4.8213,2.4585,6.7598,0.0422,5.5281,1.6814,1.9957,0.1957,2.0339,5.3455,7.2613,1.3078,1.1423,0.1428,2.4839,4.5943,3.9172,2.0754,0.2621,5.0341,0.6304,6.604,2.4941,0.0103,0.9712,3.2837,5.9462,2.0441,5.61,1.1499,1.197,2.1786,0.0975,0.9605,2.948,0.459,3.1244,4.5224,0.1023,0.6327,1.6142,0.1962,6.6327,3.153,1.7757,3.9736,1.092,4.8944,3.4564,1.1847,1.8704,0.0002,2.0062,3.4316,1.1432,0.0871,6.5584,1.9988,6.4704,5.0976,1.988,0.01,1.8424,2.9332,0.8622,1.1128,0.6474,0.0276,1.2763,1.0175,2.3269,0.3945,0.0137,1.1227,1.3283,2.3554,1.0449,3.8781,0.1171,3.5946,0.9792,0.4626,4.7556,0.0472,1.4334,4.1953,4.4344,1.0793,1.9288,2.2531,0.2954,1.5282,3.3263,2.04,5.4877,0.8554,0.2045,1.0528,2.0357,0.0106,0.5001,2.7724,2.8317,0.5804,4.1777,0.0052,2.769,6.8665,2.8677,1.4894,0.8798,0.2649,2.0295,6.5515,0.3133,3.9419,0.747,0.0308,1.7941,2.1449,1.1667,4.0138,1.3267,0.0073,3.0548,3.438,0.0082,0.1088,1.6435,6.4946,0.3434,4.6529,0.5389,0.8955,0.0002,1.9052,1.1436,0.0979,5.289,3.0761,0.0033,0.3223,5.225,6.0267,6.8698,0.5185,0.0089,2.2745,1.2045,0.5751,4.8756,0.2618,0.0651,3.642,0.02,0.3887,0.4771,0.0061,2.741,2.4356,4.817,2.4804,4.9788,0.0783,0.1115,0.3458,0.0059,1.5168,2.861,0.6793,3.0151,0.0306,4.1007,3.0986,2.7682,3.0621,0.4456,1.3895,0.0031,1.9262,1.3359,3.4227,2.2847,1.7498,5.8826,4.5001,1.1421,3.2854,1.0895,0.0228,0.9148,2.0527,0.0002,8.0374,0.66,0.0004,7.1935,0.7724,0.0003,6.6087,1.1719,0.6342,30.0201,0.071,6.6281,4.9198]}

It was on December 16th that an article in The New York Times reported on Wagner's \"foul blooded speech\". Although Wagner was at the time the world's top-ranked American baseball player, who died in December 1831, he would make no attempt to prevent his death, despite having the help of his father, and one of his great-grandparents.

With nearly two million people watching its first baseball game at the stadium, it was known as the \"Home Run Derby\" and was the \"official final match of the World Baseball Classic\".\n\nOther notable works in baseball include:\n\nWorld Series of baseball\nBill Self, World Baseball Classic (1902)\nBill Self, World Series of baseball (1913)\nBill Self, World Series of baseball (1916)\n\nMajor League Baseball games\nBill Self, World Series of baseball (1913)\n\nRoster\n\nPlayers\n\nIn addition to players, there are three other players who have appeared in the Major League Baseball game system:\n\nSee also\nNational League and Negro League\nNational League Baseball\nNational League game\nNational League Baseball\nNational League Baseball\nNational League Baseball (basketball)\nNational League Baseball (pitch)\nNational League Baseball\nNational League Baseball (football)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links","token_len":355,"entropy":[11.048,0.2711,2.9434,8.0366,0.264,8.2984,5.252,0.5221,1.2044,5.1469,1.0719,8.8079,1.4915,6.2147,6.6669,7.8326,0.0083,9.16,3.198,0.8341,6.4762,4.2765,3.211,2.1767,0.7773,2.6306,4.2054,1.1493,1.0931,5.0297,2.2277,0.6582,4.7347,13.2456,1.5593,3.0906,0.6444,0.0506,4.1683,1.9907,3.9112,1.3604,2.746,1.9995,3.4495,2.3511,4.0458,0.8218,0.7601,4.4774,0.8958,5.6942,0.2144,1.1404,8.8402,3.3017,5.7546,0.0633,5.1901,1.5904,4.1806,0.6559,4.8422,4.8958,3.479,2.6768,2.1945,5.3047,4.6916,1.1404,1.8601,1.3531,0.0832,0.1887,2.7008,2.1755,2.1173,0.1283,4.0287,4.295,3.5645,6.2533,4.2455,4.9853,3.2776,4.959,1.6306,1.5286,5.4384,1.011,0.8864,3.2615,3.7972,0.1322,3.2742,3.0609,2.5029,4.0387,4.79,0.1493,0.2156,6.8244,4.0968,1.1394,4.751,5.7471,5.5908,0.5609,1.4982,4.3106,4.7291,3.7363,3.3084,0.1087,5.6873,1.1897,0.9624,2.5926,3.2814,3.1361,3.6106,6.5075,0.0315,1.2157,3.3894,1.1442,4.3613,5.6517,0.2993,0.3972,3.8718,1.8013,0.3505,1.3775,1.146,6.0452,0.6116,0.7419,0.287,2.0383,4.5867,0.0279,3.9577,4.8528,1.8422,2.8509,5.551,5.0854,2.4302,0.3074,0.5015,4.1187,0.6165,8.6509,5.968,1.1261,1.9641,5.2672,7.6361,0.9033,5.3292,7.0252,3.1458,2.1591,2.6379,1.9904,7.932,4.6067,3.6881,0.168,3.4097,1.3278,4.2992,0.8117,2.2271,0.9034,4.5745,0.5134,0.5438,1.0544,5.1942,0.4026,0.1656,1.2896,1.0258,1.5749,2.3186,4.4591,5.7108,7.986,4.8103,0.5371,0.4997,2.2441,2.6661,0.0613,0.8917,1.3596,0.0072,5.8801,1.4875,5.455,3.0598,5.1239,3.3948,1.8955,0.3766,0.0002,4.6414,0.9797,2.9827,4.9538,1.1514,24.6105,0.3245,2.4644,4.3436,4.3805,1.9108,3.2612,0.6397,5.3208,1.4164,0.4297,23.8213,0.0609,0.502,0.5893,1.45,0.1138,0.4383,0.1421,0.2367,4.1691,0.1501,0.0994,23.6875,0.0292,0.278,0.1483,0.0384,0.0097,0.0306,0.0152,0.0638,2.4284,0.0737,0.0972,0.0002,4.9284,0.0381,0.152,5.8036,0.6435,21.3902,0.0336,0.5564,0.2325,0.057,0.0264,0.0271,0.0236,0.0741,4.0571,0.1314,0.0639,0.0002,5.5288,5.1703,1.2421,0.0005,5.3242,0.4979,0.0003,4.469,1.631,0.0316,4.8216,0.504,1.2512,0.3534,3.3764,2.0393,2.324,1.5661,1.4597,2.576,0.3933,1.1095,2.5334,0.154,0.0907,2.8031,7.9843,1.4494,0.694,0.0003,6.8449,0.6211,1.5111,23.3526,0.863,4.3539,1.5871,0.5662,2.0854,22.3959,0.3084,2.8043,1.1995,21.0624,0.1743,8.4762,3.0369,15.4851,0.1052,1.4168,1.1301,19.9664,0.0951,0.8895,1.1713,19.4268,0.0816,0.5433,3.4905,9.2504,0.2513,0.3251,13.0259,0.0153,0.2723,0.6788,4.4165,1.8622,1.0839,0.3528,13.3631,0.009,0.0795,2.425,3.4403,0.0301,0.0831,0.5135,3.131,0.0233,0.4189,0.0059,5.4643,1.6592,0.0007,5.111,0.6186]}

According to this, the company was not aware of any potential health risks which could affect the production process of that brand or potential market demand for those oils.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\nLNG Partners II","token_len":357,"entropy":[7.839,4.2984,0.1485,6.5566,4.8902,1.5245,0.0211,4.9057,0.5276,1.6086,0.6744,1.2478,6.0429,9.7211,0.2247,6.5131,0.6029,0.8883,1.6261,5.2379,3.1913,8.6277,6.6726,4.975,2.5673,10.6775,10.0907,1.9334,6.7992,2.6413,1.0718,2.3528,5.2268,0.5055,3.2664,5.7715,3.6929,1.3984,3.4119,0.1619,1.2764,1.9835,3.7816,7.6528,0.2916,4.2243,0.0538,12.8849,3.3636,3.1631,4.6775,3.3106,4.1912,0.8954,0.9286,0.0008,1.5899,4.2009,0.1071,2.3419,3.9583,4.2548,4.1863,0.0003,3.18,3.6293,1.6023,0.0035,1.5311,4.0774,5.9666,3.5131,1.0679,0.2721,2.2705,3.0142,0.0648,5.545,5.3112,4.9421,3.5908,1.9162,0.9865,4.938,7.2321,1.3545,2.5296,2.3848,4.0108,0.5935,5.1103,5.7489,6.133,0.0352,5.8491,2.281,4.2694,4.2992,2.7244,2.6733,0.1187,1.2102,0.0051,5.6614,0.8162,4.1913,1.6638,3.0696,4.3631,2.7303,2.9223,0.5322,1.2496,0.7668,0.0002,4.8697,0.4785,0.9548,0.8039,1.8264,0.0066,4.6578,2.794,0.3848,0.4753,3.0393,5.084,0.9722,2.5531,5.702,0.2538,4.2878,5.293,1.0493,4.0716,0.693,3.1185,2.1003,0.4243,5.108,2.1808,6.2211,1.3065,0.6361,6.4041,4.2162,3.333,1.9513,6.8255,5.6426,3.3347,6.9296,1.0498,4.7074,6.3971,0.3094,3.764,4.9915,6.0938,5.6933,1.0597,0.0258,4.9875,6.7188,6.0276,1.1686,3.7413,0.2413,3.0317,1.6513,2.1424,4.8587,1.6903,3.3331,5.8342,6.2971,7.1126,3.2703,6.0863,8.7325,1.7468,4.7563,1.8961,5.0029,1.5977,0.0457,1.2481,1.7265,4.7186,0.195,0.553,0.001,2.3753,1.9825,1.8178,3.7142,3.4709,3.1969,2.0026,0.6297,0.6086,0.0002,1.5697,3.4144,2.4894,0.0347,1.1,0.0074,1.7117,0.4917,1.7199,2.758,4.1636,0.0661,9.2188,1.6788,3.7196,0.8461,1.2767,3.3991,0.0018,0.0204,0.1333,3.2373,2.2103,4.5206,5.0249,0.0428,4.0491,0.9675,1.3706,3.6074,2.9038,0.0369,2.3929,4.9576,7.4961,1.0033,2.4699,0.9954,0.2188,0.9747,1.4464,5.8073,3.8152,5.9818,0.7942,0.0615,1.0225,3.1023,1.74,0.6875,1.4039,5.2689,2.9319,0.0555,1.8018,7.0938,2.3805,2.8416,2.5719,0.0909,3.1718,5.5712,1.8403,1.0802,2.2465,4.8915,5.7677,0.0253,0.6098,0.4965,0.0001,1.4388,3.0382,0.6998,0.0372,0.86,0.0038,0.4086,0.2123,1.4309,0.8187,0.2237,0.9303,6.326,2.3659,3.268,0.0016,0.0043,0.0715,5.4669,0.2098,8.3849,7.2918,4.3432,1.8617,3.7992,7.8727,0.0098,3.7223,4.3993,4.1584,0.1631,4.3833,0.8492,6.1531,1.1536,4.2177,1.3269,4.5301,0.0013,5.6941,5.6049,1.008,1.0963,2.4598,2.9674,2.697,0.4736,1.1446,3.7624,3.3934,0.8269,7.0501,1.4343,3.1502,1.6953,3.1452,3.7158,1.0012,5.2412,1.8211,2.8872,5.4194,4.9918,3.6523,0.7171,2.1993,0.5264,0.2525,0.7646,0.0001,7.7649,0.4611,0.0003,8.2692,1.3466,0.0002,6.2711,0.9293,0.4895,19.2339,0.1478,0.5836,1.0912]}

The actor was paid an annual salary of Rs 70,000 and a specialised role in a film, \"Oru\".\n\nOru is best known as the villain in the Tamil film 'Oru' (2017).\n\nOru has played two superhero roles in the Tamil film 'Kamal', but the film was originally set in Tamil and was a remake of the famous Tamil film 'Oru', making Oru part of Tamil Nadu government's vision to provide the Indian society with a fair and equitable treatment.\n\nOru has faced several controversies in the past, including accusing Kollywood of acting as though 'Oru' was a comedy. Oru has also been vocal about his inability to do a screenplay in Tamil because of bad script.\n\nSathish Phogati, a civil justice and civil liberties lawyer, alleges in a suit filed in November 2014 that \"A.H. Ramachandran\" was a director's production of an ad-hoc Tamil film that failed to use the Tamil language to depict various characters. It was a film that was supposed to depict the government of Tamil Nadu's special interest for the welfare of all the citizens.\n\nIt was subsequently dismissed by the court.\n\nSee also\n Tamil films by Tamil actor K K Advani in 2017\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links","token_len":358,"entropy":[8.063,3.0371,0.1415,10.696,1.6077,6.1227,8.1769,3.8573,7.4412,6.4655,0.4361,4.7176,0.8471,1.1465,0.2101,2.1104,3.9278,5.045,3.4248,1.2695,4.3861,2.6566,11.336,0.5231,3.7499,5.739,5.1511,7.3631,7.6215,9.3239,10.5856,5.443,6.2316,3.7334,4.5748,1.7291,5.4113,0.8786,1.4263,0.0007,1.7864,2.5546,2.988,0.128,7.9711,4.1172,0.0998,2.2858,0.3595,3.8339,3.1698,2.651,0.966,3.7858,3.8929,3.7851,0.1393,2.9764,4.3888,1.1124,3.7407,1.1458,2.2337,0.2772,2.1392,4.2599,3.9097,6.2342,0.3909,3.1573,1.4158,6.611,4.2944,0.0052,1.5678,2.4881,5.4759,3.6283,1.6302,0.8104,0.9592,4.6456,0.8601,1.9444,5.7162,2.9858,4.3203,3.9542,5.3136,0.5341,0.0928,2.1395,5.4089,0.344,0.0227,2.0032,3.0715,5.5771,4.9737,4.1643,0.8858,2.477,1.9074,3.0824,4.0413,1.7762,0.0317,1.8916,0.632,0.0003,4.9068,0.0432,1.8769,7.4745,0.0724,2.3613,0.8952,3.9283,1.2945,0.9383,6.133,1.2248,4.5042,3.338,0.3583,2.2603,1.2865,5.5579,1.2277,1.0994,0.0002,3.4766,0.1677,2.5942,5.2783,3.8349,8.1481,2.6393,1.0398,0.9752,4.4054,0.7944,0.6532,3.9397,3.3682,2.2553,3.7697,3.8456,2.7499,2.4364,2.038,4.5205,3.6144,0.7701,3.547,2.7003,2.002,4.6809,2.6522,0.3422,0.6855,5.78,2.4592,2.033,0.5067,2.5462,0.2437,3.0121,5.3728,2.9815,0.0065,5.941,0.0527,4.5051,3.2039,6.7091,0.7788,5.1433,2.0628,5.0674,3.6145,4.6201,5.1542,0.1329,1.011,4.9775,1.1149,2.5386,4.6003,1.8887,0.577,0.0002,2.7342,0.032,2.0189,6.0874,3.8514,2.5169,1.6321,0.6279,0.725,1.2519,0.6395,6.3704,5.2594,4.3997,1.3511,5.0704,1.0066,6.5198,5.3402,1.5325,0.022,0.3305,0.9251,0.9991,5.2726,1.7719,3.9257,0.0118,1.6053,0.9175,1.2093,5.5326,1.0573,0.4264,7.0605,0.02,4.5548,2.8339,5.5522,2.2447,1.8148,3.9455,0.8832,6.704,3.626,2.4545,0.4956,0.0002,4.6405,0.3305,0.0082,8.572,5.4111,6.3631,0.4407,1.708,4.915,6.7736,3.365,3.3725,1.4985,0.7738,1.0278,7.4314,2.1479,2.8238,4.2098,0.3656,0.885,4.2426,1.2347,0.4576,3.9151,5.4496,3.5709,5.4914,0.191,6.2952,2.2112,0.7242,0.0044,2.463,2.2254,2.8707,4.2637,3.3938,7.7077,1.7225,3.5951,6.2948,1.2318,0.6004,0.0431,3.8345,0.9896,2.9463,5.1934,0.1548,5.4335,1.2238,2.1068,0.8137,4.5676,3.7781,5.9009,2.5849,0.8688,4.9352,1.3845,2.879,2.8999,0.9726,1.283,4.0239,0.0054,3.2337,1.5298,5.0736,2.9641,0.5635,0.0268,2.22,6.6023,3.3151,4.9976,1.4463,3.6256,0.0427,3.5917,2.3269,1.0286,1.2206,0.4075,0.0002,4.3669,0.8852,5.5444,5.4474,0.8361,0.2836,1.6173,1.2964,0.625,0.0002,6.8726,1.5251,2.4511,25.4416,4.5018,3.8049,3.6209,2.4874,4.3408,5.5258,5.3672,0.0059,3.7419,3.036,1.1366,0.0004,4.5811,0.8999,0.0004,4.9285,0.9741]}

The commercial, directed by Nicki Minaj, is a spoof on Vicky White-Samantha from the '60s sitcom, 'Good Morning TV'.\n\n It was the opening night of the annual US presidential elections.[21]\n\nIn 1992, the company bought Stereo Pictures' rights to the advert and produced a commercial and a video in 1992 for it.\n\nIn October 1993 Stereo Pictures acquired rights to the advert and had it presented on national television network The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.[22] The advert featured Stereo Pictures' then president Peter Kipchoge and its current president, Kevin Coyle, as a guest guest on the show's first programme, which was in 1992.[23][24]\n\nAlthough in 2002, both Stereo Pictures and Stereo Studios produced the commercial, it was replaced with a different commercial, with the use of the 'lighter and more colourful version of the same theme song' in the same year. All the other segments have been recorded for the same broadcast station.[25][26]\n\nIn September 2003, the original commercial (as seen in 2002) was removed from the broadcast.\n\nIn April 2014, Stereo Studios (founded and based in Brooklyn) bought Stereo Studios and replaced it with a new version which includes the commercial in 1992.\n\nIt was the second commercial of that series in a row (June 2015 and September 2018).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nAtomiko","token_len":359,"entropy":[5.4146,1.3522,0.6006,2.2338,7.647,0.027,5.0911,5.5188,8.4989,1.799,6.5936,0.1954,7.963,11.2082,13.2487,8.2146,14.2953,3.4237,3.457,0.0252,5.4437,2.9781,5.5018,8.8509,0.2269,0.3923,9.257,0.403,13.1191,3.9575,2.2177,1.5069,4.6885,2.5586,6.4877,11.9793,6.5356,6.0111,5.3668,0.7651,1.4801,6.6764,8.6795,2.3593,3.2031,2.2851,3.2242,1.5901,1.8548,4.2225,3.6322,2.896,0.8469,0.2152,0.2602,7.75,7.3257,4.7225,2.1667,4.6797,0.2275,5.2399,4.5731,1.2837,0.0009,0.4726,2.5282,2.0096,3.5509,2.7792,7.2627,3.4286,9.1973,5.7658,4.9127,7.3256,0.0042,4.5273,1.5352,4.5811,1.8847,0.0065,1.5915,2.0696,2.9355,5.1184,1.2517,8.6805,1.0747,4.4487,14.1186,1.6918,3.2795,4.9987,5.526,0.2853,0.8384,4.568,6.0332,5.0143,3.905,8.7008,5.1259,0.0803,1.6932,0.0021,2.3796,5.4174,0.398,1.8213,4.74,3.6746,6.9592,3.2062,4.3119,4.0954,4.288,0.2515,1.1234,3.5665,2.0464,4.073,1.4692,3.6016,6.2568,2.1077,2.6488,3.126,4.2208,2.2442,4.223,1.0166,2.3359,0.0003,1.3798,4.8408,2.3468,5.5297,0.0006,2.8224,3.2141,5.0956,0.1731,0.8009,2.4694,1.6769,4.8297,1.9941,5.7902,3.0391,4.8291,0.462,7.4951,3.2168,3.0657,0.002,1.1316,2.7081,0.0015,2.2025,0.1506,0.0932,2.5403,2.4998,3.2008,5.216,0.0147,2.7319,1.1832,6.0942,3.4119,4.7082,4.798,6.9727,4.8613,5.1086,2.3227,3.5591,2.9393,0.9403,1.9624,5.4701,5.5939,4.8896,0.7473,2.391,3.5473,4.1751,6.0562,1.9548,0.7304,0.9338,4.6669,2.239,4.5181,0.762,3.0757,1.4752,4.564,3.272,2.3264,0.1299,2.6676,0.0396,0.2178,0.832,0.0002,6.1339,4.3632,4.3208,1.9789,5.9841,1.8805,0.001,1.213,0.0949,1.8919,0.0617,3.8949,4.8491,1.1667,1.2952,0.6342,1.8013,0.5602,6.2279,1.8845,0.7652,4.0872,1.7844,2.5587,2.9766,1.5828,5.4784,0.0154,1.9581,3.9448,6.8975,3.9744,3.1293,1.0789,2.9839,4.8844,2.0389,0.5912,2.9681,4.6118,0.7175,1.3897,2.9198,1.3012,3.2205,4.4765,1.4697,6.8442,2.0444,2.9047,6.0476,3.8263,0.9494,5.7348,2.1798,1.4103,2.8208,4.4133,3.5783,1.9432,0.2649,1.5118,0.0277,0.2135,0.5172,0.0002,1.6386,3.8669,2.1044,0.5581,1.64,5.2758,1.8699,5.1567,4.1214,3.0985,0.8448,6.2428,0.3855,0.5319,2.44,0.4257,1.1463,3.7996,2.7425,1.243,0.0002,1.2568,2.7083,3.4654,0.2913,1.5213,0.0026,1.9371,5.0559,4.5322,5.1136,4.8669,0.0564,6.3898,1.1362,3.6866,2.4326,0.0147,1.6274,2.427,5.1599,0.5723,0.0346,1.1354,0.8157,3.3032,3.5768,3.7589,1.7184,3.0479,3.1639,5.431,0.8158,0.9921,0.0001,4.9771,1.1673,2.6042,2.9916,1.2512,2.1568,5.8304,3.8713,3.203,3.0693,0.467,3.652,8.5528,2.1847,4.588,2.2025,3.6571,1.8693,0.729,0.0002,4.258,2.1629,0.0005,2.7263,0.4335,1.4164,0.0004,8.4462,3.7183,10.1246]}

The city\u2019s power system was out of service for nearly a month and many residents were left without electricity because of the lack of reliable sources of electricity.\n\nWhat followed was a catastrophe that was no longer an accident that should have happened long ago. As part of a broader initiative to tackle the climate crisis and to respond to the increasing heat and drought, New York City was forced to temporarily shut off all electricity services.\n\nNew York City will not reopen power to its citizens until an international agreement is reached.

An estimated 26 million cubic yards ( 20 million cubic meters ) remained, making most of the capital the hardest hit by the quake. The US Geological Survey report shows that 9 percent of the world\u2019s destruction was from the earth tremors that struck on Thursday, including the quake\u2019s epicenter. But there are also some regions that did not experience the worst effects. An assessment by the American Geological Survey says that one of the best ways to prevent this outcome will be to prevent and\/or respond to the major earthquake and tsunami of 2015.\n\nSome 80 percent of the ground is still covered by debris from the earthquake, but the remaining ground is under water and it was a relatively shallow quake. The magnitude to which it caused its epicenter was 0.3, a figure that compares with the magnitude of a typical earthquake of the magnitude 19 that struck off the Pacific Northwest. A further 2.2 had an epicenter that had an angle that was even 50 degrees more. That\u2019s a figure that is far closer to the magnitude of a small earthquake, or 8.3, which struck off the coast of Australia.\n\n\u201cAs of this writing, there is still much debris in place. The damage from yesterday\u2019s quake is $15.5 million in damages. In total, the damage at Port Adelaide, the largest South Australian town in the middle of this country, is approximately $8.6 million, almost twice the amount covered by the earthquake. But that is still far from enough to rebuild homes, and that is why we are putting together a group of government representatives [which] will be working on a plan to address these issues throughout the day.\u201d","token_len":362,"entropy":[6.978,1.3838,1.4385,7.442,7.8491,4.4199,0.2911,7.2244,1.2015,0.0248,0.9754,5.3353,4.2265,12.0525,0.3391,1.3122,5.6162,1.4565,5.4776,1.8367,3.7091,2.3106,2.0356,12.3349,2.2344,0.5322,1.2086,0.2465,4.5122,3.7563,4.7173,6.5562,0.0661,0.3648,7.5062,3.2128,4.999,0.1706,2.1994,0.3252,0.6845,0.2182,2.4168,5.4564,0.3204,0.0048,6.956,4.1426,0.6336,6.0172,3.6664,0.0368,0.3087,5.5873,16.9521,6.3067,4.7361,7.036,1.4566,4.5243,1.4792,7.1175,6.0086,0.0006,2.5188,1.4268,3.7484,6.0636,1.4253,4.0141,1.4608,3.2827,5.7693,0.1597,0.5012,2.5483,0.1798,0.9184,4.9018,3.8333,1.6432,2.5431,3.5198,6.5605,1.3806,4.9234,0.3063,1.4076,1.4979,3.3501,3.0728,1.0983,5.3894,6.4429,0.8049,0.4771,4.5167,0.6446,0.0509,3.1634,0.7526,5.4541,1.9855,0.3188,4.9636,5.2914,0.1323,3.548,4.1182,7.9071,4.4736,0.042,0.3222,5.3606,4.1447,5.483,0.0006,4.0771,0.2606,1.4513,5.3889,2.288,2.8299,0.3952,3.3694,4.2401,1.0927,1.6793,0.0495,5.7033,6.226,0.8746,0.0195,0.3718,5.5595,2.793,2.3602,2.6305,1.0454,1.7835,2.126,0.3991,2.0062,1.1528,2.0573,1.8268,4.536,4.8088,0.7916,4.6566,2.7452,1.5948,4.6862,4.0023,4.5773,3.2848,4.0329,2.5414,0.9035,1.7071,5.1236,7.7128,5.3797,1.7391,3.1984,4.613,2.5973,0.1255,1.738,3.7335,0.0026,3.217,1.6001,3.7532,5.3864,0.6702,5.8346,1.3697,1.29,2.8039,0.8296,2.1196,4.3778,2.3836,1.7511,3.4585,1.8541,8.2256,3.8186,0.5563,5.3466,0.8421,3.5665,3.1006,2.7692,4.0027,4.7129,3.4727,0.4141,2.2341,9.251,3.1634,2.6929,0.0567,2.6522,4.2645,1.7939,5.6108,4.299,0.6641,5.4105,5.3867,0.3181,5.9783,4.2833,4.5058,15.2392,0.2895,0.3098,1.8415,4.6931,0.5384,1.3469,3.4662,4.6422,0.161,0.9956,2.1652,0.9425,1.042,3.9479,0.959,2.3187,3.7121,5.9647,0.6354,2.3791,1.256,2.6613,0.609,0.6507,0.42,1.6343,0.0697,4.0406,2.0127,0.8306,0.0004,3.8859,5.0134,7.3388,1.3142,3.537,0.2378,0.1706,1.8032,1.5803,1.5284,3.3238,3.4475,2.1053,5.0313,2.0697,1.917,4.405,2.0904,6.6881,1.8632,0.3894,0.0601,1.1924,1.0611,6.0724,4.4539,1.7523,1.7261,1.2157,3.0194,3.3941,1.1638,4.129,3.3252,0.1911,1.5249,3.0549,4.4176,6.2831,5.5532,2.071,2.606,3.4773,7.827,0.3854,2.8186,1.9077,0.8376,5.4157,0.0737,4.6128,4.8937,0.2373,0.8278,4.9751,0.026,3.781,0.9062,2.2654,0.0128,1.9118,5.146,2.844,0.6152,1.3775,5.1367,0.2564,0.4861,3.6325,0.5446,4.9517,2.5442,1.3292,2.0238,2.6385,1.7318,4.7128,0.3547,4.5742,3.1695,1.2973,2.6276,3.0524,0.939,2.4487,4.0184,1.3612,4.8159,2.7133,0.7619,5.5727,0.4398,5.9895,3.6479,9.8937,5.4963,2.6866,1.4392,1.657,2.1601,2.0547,2.3117,1.6728,0.5267,3.3322,3.2886,1.3612,5.8662,0.6648,3.5862,1.3898,4.8471,5.806]}

However, due to Xia's treatment by the Department of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong (Unicorn), Yue developed the disease Loupion disease which resulted in loss of both his motor and cognitive function and loss of his ability to drive.

Construction would be finished between May\/June.\n\nSee also\n Trunkway\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Tyss\u00f8y Municipality\n Biodiversit\u00e9","token_len":366,"entropy":[11.1261,2.2998,6.2553,3.3764,2.6763,2.2765,10.3337,3.6405,12.3277,3.2898,6.7879,1.5379,2.1637,2.1649,2.3926,0.6497,1.1601,6.8837,6.3283,3.5119,1.0281,1.8987,9.8658,5.9981,4.4862,1.6597,0.8939,2.3799,0.4827,0.0251,0.0378,0.7424,3.9498,5.6621,6.342,7.6961,1.2741,1.7743,3.4655,2.5417,4.865,2.8523,0.0188,0.0031,0.0011,7.3243,0.1482,0.5994,3.7031,1.8314,6.2824,2.2714,3.1612,0.3699,4.5528,3.6033,1.3703,0.1065,0.9971,2.6,1.7601,5.0774,1.3259,1.0791,0.0063,2.5973,4.1038,0.3073,1.3424,6.7971,0.0044,0.0043,0.005,3.9685,0.0118,4.389,3.2445,0.8464,2.3515,4.1434,14.1706,2.6137,7.4104,3.1841,0.3705,3.6211,5.4652,0.7709,7.067,7.1149,6.0904,2.1797,2.3215,0.9811,5.1275,5.878,2.3317,0.9327,6.2243,5.8123,0.3484,8.6254,4.139,3.314,3.2552,2.6685,3.6073,2.0106,2.5912,0.6499,5.7093,3.3291,1.0096,3.6399,2.4013,2.3567,4.258,0.8594,3.9476,3.2789,5.8867,4.8933,1.9078,1.8329,1.4123,2.6559,3.1165,5.4277,1.9473,2.1584,5.9423,1.674,2.7795,0.3561,1.8131,1.5109,1.1466,2.1879,0.1318,2.7863,4.1865,2.1387,2.2196,6.3684,2.5022,2.4001,1.1983,3.6249,4.4626,4.1927,2.6526,5.7614,0.1802,4.5058,3.8721,5.6545,3.4204,3.5918,3.803,0.1818,0.2191,4.1337,1.5346,6.9699,3.0262,1.7497,1.2345,2.2308,1.1941,0.9242,0.025,2.805,2.9764,0.2479,6.5866,3.4146,0.8521,3.8506,5.612,5.6274,0.0351,6.192,5.6149,0.8758,2.142,3.9189,3.1824,1.1766,1.0525,7.8627,1.6293,2.3917,5.573,4.3335,3.7509,4.4551,2.3888,4.2523,5.6986,2.9969,1.7713,1.2806,4.7861,6.5749,4.2776,4.4369,4.2512,1.1482,1.8743,0.0437,2.2349,0.8333,0.7527,0.0004,5.7334,3.2934,0.9056,3.2783,4.6829,1.0704,1.5943,1.1552,6.1457,0.1299,2.9034,0.6046,0.8985,1.3774,1.9216,0.3204,0.0034,1.7449,0.4701,0.4869,1.4723,0.0003,1.8499,5.6623,4.2022,5.383,1.9898,5.1047,0.0714,5.9928,3.2327,6.7711,3.2195,3.0155,2.2391,3.9575,4.129,2.8954,0.4271,4.427,2.2793,2.9281,1.0306,5.1623,0.0069,0.0018,0.0014,3.4056,1.6356,2.3904,4.0835,1.5347,2.844,1.2987,3.8413,6.1603,2.4143,0.0729,2.7921,1.9477,2.9897,4.8791,1.4338,1.5325,1.807,1.8971,1.0389,1.4072,3.2861,1.22,5.278,0.9837,3.7199,1.1349,4.1586,7.1977,3.097,1.8506,5.1222,2.8664,1.4025,5.0984,5.7683,2.7242,0.0007,0.0008,0.0004,5.6758,0.6398,3.5752,4.0905,5.3509,0.2228,0.1101,2.0886,4.3486,3.4223,3.819,6.5085,2.1257,0.259,2.7868,3.0678,0.347,4.5614,3.9322,1.5803,2.1065,6.2188,4.1261,2.2634,5.5556,4.2393,3.3511,1.9114,3.7429,5.3265,2.1877,3.3549,4.3289,3.1027,2.4624,0.0981,4.7147,0.6085,0.0002,6.3868,0.9458,2.0068,20.0589,3.3641,7.6532,3.6842,0.0122,3.5931,0.899,0.0007,5.1608,0.5752,0.9038,23.2881,0.0019,0.0017,0.0009,1.3076,0.03,2.6545,13.5825,6.6637,3.9083,5.263]}
{"id":3688,"ended":false,"length":312,"text":"Throughout the period, horses were rarely considered breeds, but instead were defined by type : by describing their purpose or their physical attributes. Many of the definitions were not precise, or even relevant \u2013 the French were more concerned with keeping animals in a stable rather than in being bred as a species. It is important to note that these terms may have been applied to the same horses as well, rather than any particular breed  for those of us who remember the beginning of the English-speaking world. Horses are regarded as both breeds and people breeds, and horses are very important in today's society if animals and society are to succeed, and not simply because they are popularized.\n\nEtymology\n\nIn the French vernacular term, there are two variants and one of the variations is to be found in the Spanish root 'r\u00faquina', which means 'horse' and the English 'r\u00faquina' which means 'cat' which means 'horse'.  The French do not understand vernacular or English translations of French vernacular in addition to the Spanish, Spanish and Italian transliteration. The original vernacular had been widely used in Germany (also known as \"Hinterland\" or \"Hobel\" ) in the 1830s to describe the town where Lilliput, a town of about 300 people, was established.\n\nHistorical meaning\n\nThe first words of the term were \"horse\" and \"horses\" and both are now used by Americans (including me, who use the Spanish for many of the other pronunciations). The words are often referred to as both vernacular and English-language (as opposed to the common noun vernacular which is most commonly used in English and Spanish ).\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nEnglish","token_len":367,"entropy":[1.9201,5.0961,1.1403,10.5621,1.3746,5.8128,5.0886,9.6088,2.1011,1.583,3.674,1.4433,5.1909,0.5014,7.2717,10.2,6.7963,9.7727,1.9163,7.493,2.5836,2.8228,4.4504,2.4189,0.7754,5.2396,1.7967,0.6784,7.1395,1.9174,4.1158,4.7913,1.0268,4.3368,2.4057,5.2904,7.4198,3.1389,6.8561,3.8581,3.6982,2.2618,0.2343,5.6684,3.8921,2.0404,2.0651,2.928,5.2707,0.0048,2.7648,4.022,5.5227,3.259,1.5913,4.4383,0.3084,4.1984,1.1476,2.447,0.1472,0.7758,0.2397,3.4588,4.2141,3.8719,1.36,0.9726,2.6805,0.665,2.7828,3.5045,3.4348,1.5431,2.5397,0.9957,4.618,0.0093,5.5386,1.4572,1.3789,11.224,9.0519,4.8162,2.6589,1.4304,0.4519,6.6905,1.5577,7.3993,0.1599,0.6786,4.2925,2.964,0.5298,0.0673,0.4393,4.2849,2.3933,5.0651,0.2966,5.6069,6.3017,0.3243,4.4422,9.1086,1.0581,1.341,5.7695,0.88,6.2145,3.7226,1.6904,6.1052,0.0033,1.4215,5.7028,7.9045,4.459,3.5515,0.5194,0.4529,4.492,3.3277,1.7477,4.0338,2.3123,2.7521,1.206,0.4353,4.7725,6.4243,1.186,1.3415,0.2352,5.5079,0.9285,1.413,0.0001,3.1745,1.3232,4.8528,7.316,0.3209,0.0012,5.6785,1.8025,5.1423,1.0552,1.6177,4.425,5.7104,2.8877,1.8869,1.2935,4.5545,1.0052,4.7488,0.9296,0.8454,0.2496,1.0827,5.0919,7.8662,5.5663,5.8032,3.4319,6.0619,4.8316,1.8298,1.0602,1.1188,0.8691,2.9482,1.83,1.4598,2.8483,3.2771,3.0745,1.0725,0.4902,0.7714,1.1547,1.114,1.8166,0.3088,0.1316,5.6927,1.9281,4.7831,0.8771,0.1101,2.2035,0.4232,5.884,8.422,2.3703,5.8511,0.2758,5.3666,4.6795,0.0066,0.0022,4.5207,2.2956,6.5516,0.5964,4.5728,3.0103,0.0006,0.0006,5.5125,7.0591,0.0163,1.5874,3.3047,1.5201,6.2677,1.5509,2.002,6.2972,1.1714,2.7939,1.2909,2.1352,4.0048,3.3712,0.0014,0.0045,6.073,2.8332,5.4668,0.5614,1.1672,6.5066,3.4135,6.5898,1.2449,0.0309,3.577,4.3381,5.3783,0.1875,1.49,0.997,0.409,2.2603,4.5576,3.9138,2.1894,4.4025,3.0804,0.4554,5.826,0.0823,3.743,1.6305,1.551,7.1546,3.7063,7.5386,4.8655,1.8104,0.0317,2.3562,1.5744,2.2934,1.3553,1.9565,3.6496,1.5839,0.6863,1.2359,3.5112,0.8948,2.2148,0.0002,5.687,0.2944,4.254,0.1751,0.0001,1.4432,4.4165,4.586,1.7779,0.591,4.4,3.3929,2.8672,2.3094,0.6959,0.5246,0.4565,3.869,0.9792,1.0248,2.1851,4.4443,2.6286,3.3974,1.2757,2.7119,6.2205,3.6129,3.5474,3.7911,2.3735,1.7624,5.6678,1.251,5.3007,3.6102,4.6198,1.0286,1.2798,3.7646,6.168,0.0041,0.0193,1.7609,1.5295,4.61,2.4685,2.4886,4.2035,0.0254,0.5047,5.31,3.8945,0.0109,0.0034,0.6008,0.9727,4.0722,2.1776,4.6731,3.0025,2.4254,0.0047,2.5345,4.4226,4.0559,2.1836,0.094,0.0659,3.3058,1.0431,6.2377,1.2076,0.3096,0.9473,1.9792,2.724,2.9992,4.9183,1.3383,0.0002,3.5816,0.6424,0.0003,4.0158,0.5768,0.376,0.0002,6.1639]}

The deal saw Eagle Boys move into Sydney and South Australia for the first time. Eagle Boy subsequently became the largest pizza delivery company in Australia.The deal was approved in July 2008.A large portion of Eagle Boys sales is due to an extensive network of pizza sellers throughout Australia and South Africa \"A New Way To Pay Out\".The company has had its own number of local businesses for over 30 years. It is also owned and operated by the Eagle Boys.\n\nThe largest Australian franchise of Pizza and Pizza Express in terms of pizza delivery capacity has closed in Adelaide as part of a comprehensive reorganization of the company. The company aims to have 30,000 Pizza and Pizza Express in the US. The Pizza company will have an estimated sales capacity in Adelaide of over 50% of the Pizza House's customer base. Additionally, the company plans to expand globally, moving further inland. Eagle Boys is the only company to have in North America both a franchise and a retail location.\n\nThe company also has an Australian franchise that operates in Australia and New Zealand where it has a strong presence. The franchise, operated and managed by Eagle Boys, is the largest pizza delivery business in Australia.

I used to be in the back row, so the way I moved and the way the people went around was pretty much what happened everywhere else too.)","token_len":369,"entropy":[8.7558,7.6989,5.1245,10.3087,12.6082,5.307,11.0278,10.9714,0.9297,7.252,8.7849,3.6631,10.4286,1.9876,7.9055,1.2374,3.8239,0.701,5.741,4.5572,0.3304,4.1971,10.1552,11.267,6.8303,4.6889,5.5683,5.269,2.6048,5.5969,1.3376,2.7888,8.888,3.4561,8.247,1.8807,0.0074,0.0003,3.1098,4.8929,0.2524,0.5612,1.828,3.1046,1.0169,0.9595,4.3528,3.0816,3.3377,5.3237,3.5906,4.3194,3.3573,2.8388,2.4135,2.2689,5.944,3.2921,0.9088,3.6101,1.3835,2.5822,1.6346,4.1345,1.9457,4.8263,5.3452,4.212,4.6945,2.5473,3.0233,6.1019,0.0963,2.1251,6.4151,8.5479,4.594,3.0451,2.4378,0.0523,2.7493,3.9313,0.4999,0.0861,1.6626,5.5046,0.1955,0.134,4.3083,0.047,1.6032,0.0754,0.2609,0.1828,0.0425,0.2295,0.0038,0.0113,0.0002,0.0301,0.1322,0.0008,0.0008,0.2315,0.2151,8.4019,12.5273,5.154,5.3356,0.0001,5.2631,1.0874,3.9682,0.2854,2.162,1.2085,4.7836,6.052,1.6692,6.2203,3.8727,0.4357,0.2231,0.2073,0.3677,1.5976,2.1808,4.6457,3.2387,3.3775,7.0199,2.4594,1.8439,4.7353,2.399,2.1307,1.0225,2.2854,1.273,7.5327,0.1358,4.8053,0.7537,1.6153,0.0002,3.5904,0.3937,1.1308,0.0202,0.2117,0.1448,0.1906,0.3853,0.017,0.0236,0.0017,0.0015,0.0028,0.0003,0.0015,0.0268,0.0793,0.009,0.0045,0.0012,0.0004,0.0006,0.0596,0.0043,0.0033,0.0014,0.0016,0.0028,0.0015,0.0011,0.0009,0.0034,0.0008,0.553,0.0001,1.9774,4.1231,1.4171,2.8519,4.4883,1.5605,2.4838,1.5014,0.4383,1.4923,1.8734,2.6721,1.0809,0.4503,1.8886,2.3903,3.1967,3.0705,7.1916,1.7668,3.4466,2.2367,2.6486,1.7157,5.3697,1.4082,3.4261,0.2703,0.5372,1.6504,3.837,6.9662,0.0387,1.224,5.382,4.8123,3.9495,1.631,1.3742,0.1916,4.0626,4.3589,5.8497,4.806,2.3354,0.0197,0.2717,1.2084,0.0002,0.4525,0.0786,0.0036,0.0008,0.002,0.0058,0.0044,0.0031,0.003,0.0015,0.0011,0.0115,0.0004,0.0004,0.003,0.0008,0.0017,0.001,0.0007,0.0011,0.0012,0.0169,0.001,0.0006,0.0011,0.0017,0.0013,0.0009,0.0026,0.0015,0.0027,0.0009,0.0005,0.0022,0.0021,0.0,0.0007,0.0054,0.0004,0.0015,0.0008,0.0005,0.0017,0.001,0.0019,0.0014,0.0005,0.0405,0.0001,1.0051,6.2495,4.3907,0.6913,6.2811,1.8437,1.1501,6.7217,2.4181,4.8764,5.5925,1.6243,2.1245,5.1243,1.5631,3.4022,4.1108,2.4496,2.8483,5.4279,0.6329,3.3758,2.1205,0.5198,2.4095,5.0824,3.4155,7.6503,0.3559,1.8559,1.3373,0.3047,1.6522,4.3594,0.7002,7.4318,1.5769,2.6332,2.3669,1.881,5.1289,1.7605,5.2982,1.5571,4.9422,2.3121,4.9723,0.4787,1.8369,6.1023,2.4038,0.6751,5.4577,5.0846,2.137,2.3112,1.8852,1.1922,0.1414,2.5929,1.6598,4.6895,0.1536,2.3765,1.3426,0.6679,0.7176,0.1935,2.5273,3.2322,3.3768,6.4237,0.8428,5.1097,4.167,2.4692,0.7388,2.8946,3.9919,4.6287,2.717,1.4689,2.6117,1.7039,3.2741,4.7206,7.3849,0.7202,5.7503,0.8617]}

It gradually became better organized over the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and on October 15, a powerful superlative passed through the Caribbean Sea. The superlative was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones of all time while a small remnant was also present in Tropical Storm Gretchen in early October. It was located at 1  northeast of Cuba and at a length of. The total area of the system was. It was named after Henri, the founder and chief of the Spanish expedition to the British Columbia\u2013Newfoundland Islands in 1824. That year, the hurricane was located near Cape Verde and had sustained winds of 25  above the surface. The system also formed and was a cyclone as its center passed to the northwest of Cuba on October 17, 1804.\n\nA tropical cyclone is the name given to a developing system when it is near a core and is in the throes of changing pressure and temperature or has moved away from its center, weakening to a central area. It is characterized by strong tropical weather, with a strengthening period where it moves away from its center of pressure, increasing and slowing to cool to a calm and clear night. It also forms a cyclone as its center moves away from the center, intensifying and slowing in the night as it passes over the central part of Cuba. Because it is so distant from the center, it is more prone to a rainstorm than other tropical storm systems.\n\nSee also\n Tropical cyclone of the 21st century\n List of tropical cyclones of the 20th century\n List of cyclones formed in the Caribbean by the 19th century\n List of tropical cyclones of the 21st century by the 20th century\n\nReferences\n\nNotes","token_len":369,"entropy":[12.2663,0.9389,11.4595,0.632,5.4394,7.5838,2.1083,1.8354,4.3871,8.3992,0.6675,3.4561,8.8469,5.1497,0.3506,2.2082,2.9093,7.4084,2.4338,2.7065,6.5242,4.2666,6.317,4.9244,2.2238,0.7908,7.8855,3.1375,3.9086,1.5179,1.8615,5.808,4.2565,3.3365,0.6496,5.5032,3.6281,6.2831,5.9437,0.5856,4.9925,1.0613,0.6634,2.127,2.308,1.3006,1.7228,4.2809,0.0673,0.0076,1.7209,5.55,0.1256,0.3369,1.7748,0.7656,3.494,2.0363,0.0378,2.1898,1.6113,0.091,8.2646,4.6783,4.1704,4.7135,2.7176,4.231,2.6985,1.4269,7.5034,0.1188,9.4339,3.2418,3.5784,4.8844,1.8618,0.88,2.9976,1.0182,5.0055,2.2945,4.6862,9.5862,10.9933,0.6985,5.514,1.6825,4.081,3.4446,4.6729,0.0783,9.4843,5.4918,5.2614,2.5133,0.4714,0.5384,4.4061,0.7065,5.2582,3.4753,0.7734,5.0058,1.7507,7.2788,4.9987,1.248,3.3116,3.1611,3.0286,1.1009,0.384,2.6839,4.4286,0.8541,0.6923,5.3539,4.7345,8.0212,3.1853,2.1183,4.5308,2.0964,1.4211,4.6435,0.4226,6.3232,3.5765,0.6352,1.4528,3.0355,1.5445,4.8785,2.6097,3.6795,2.8237,0.0013,2.0872,4.1228,4.3998,1.306,0.2296,4.762,6.1636,8.3963,1.4324,4.4766,0.6588,1.5593,3.4824,3.7415,3.6089,5.9353,2.6777,3.3065,6.4162,0.0734,4.6658,5.0591,4.6958,8.2905,6.0171,0.9538,2.947,1.6892,2.4459,2.4657,0.4429,2.4212,1.1025,1.1867,3.5872,0.3588,2.1091,0.0101,3.7146,3.0782,0.7478,0.0208,1.8621,3.2062,4.0128,0.6124,0.2382,0.4936,7.9847,2.6407,4.3447,0.931,1.3957,5.2184,1.5274,5.8123,2.9056,2.4908,4.1749,1.6117,6.0668,0.0006,0.0156,5.3293,6.1569,2.2371,2.629,5.5756,4.5376,4.5526,3.6768,0.063,2.1801,1.5649,3.1921,6.5228,4.3675,0.7992,4.9788,4.7502,0.7422,2.1287,0.7189,3.5212,0.0588,3.1521,3.5947,5.5065,1.9232,3.791,1.9217,6.3095,5.5487,6.0306,1.1916,2.6056,2.5505,0.0503,1.2741,0.3222,4.8775,2.8172,1.86,5.0799,3.922,4.7296,3.3165,7.4522,3.6233,1.192,5.2194,3.0004,5.6047,6.046,0.4725,1.8219,3.0692,2.5921,1.7675,3.3641,0.0799,2.7069,1.6247,0.5235,1.2421,1.6885,0.0483,1.9863,0.6954,2.4792,6.1738,0.0172,1.2979,2.1479,4.234,1.8205,3.394,4.0653,0.43,2.9689,1.9204,0.7508,2.815,3.0578,0.0383,3.4948,0.4873,5.3081,1.8247,0.8507,2.752,5.5165,0.5266,0.3955,0.5261,0.839,0.633,0.9373,3.5114,3.3201,0.0098,3.9985,6.6173,1.0724,1.3889,3.0844,0.4832,4.4466,0.375,0.5376,1.1196,0.0003,6.0857,1.2785,1.9558,27.0428,3.3997,1.3939,4.0639,1.3726,5.7997,0.0297,0.3262,1.4144,22.9378,0.0625,1.4871,0.1323,0.1125,1.7876,0.3012,3.2325,0.0366,0.0762,0.8811,22.0563,0.0017,4.2084,0.0672,8.4342,1.511,0.6298,2.6597,3.6218,1.7417,3.5373,0.0219,0.0585,0.7674,21.1757,0.0024,0.4517,0.1092,0.0516,1.4423,0.1458,2.443,0.0003,0.0221,4.3524,2.1129,4.2444,0.0074,0.1022,0.6044,0.0003,1.6473,0.9346,0.0005,4.9753]}

On the following day, the wave spawned powerful waves that destroyed the town of Port Elizabeth.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest storms to hit the Western Hemisphere on record. It is an important season for tropical storms, which is an event of increasing importance year-round. During those seasons, the weather patterns change with tropical storms, with the possibility for significant rainfall and storm surge events, in addition to hurricanes.\n\nThe tropical storm, named Ellen and named after Hurricane Ellen, was one of the strongest and longest storms to hit the Caribbean area in more than 100 years. The storm caused significant destruction and flooding in Port Elizabeth, North Africa as well as parts of West Africa. The powerful storm was centered on the eastern coast of the country, with sustained winds of between 155 and 200 km per hour (88 miles per hour).\n\nA tropical cyclone is a small or small storm where winds drop into the range of about 100 km per hour (66 miles per hour), with the wind strength being primarily responsible for its destructive power. The storm, named and named for Ellen, was centered on the eastern coast of Ghana and recorded winds of up to 125 km per hour (65 miles per hour). It was moved to tropical cyclone form, with sustained winds of between 155 and 175 km per hour.\n\nOn January 8, 2017, the storm destroyed approximately one of the most important roads in West Africa, the main highway to the capital, Accra.\n\nCategory: Weather, Category: Tropical Storm, NPPs (NPSs): Category\n\u2013 Category: Tropical Storm\n\u2013 Category: Hurricane\n\u2013 Category: Tropical Storm\n\u2013 Category: Hurricane\n\u2013 Category: Hurricane","token_len":370,"entropy":[9.9305,8.3346,2.9498,0.4938,2.1364,2.1585,5.0853,9.5529,1.4109,5.0324,5.1197,0.6764,1.9925,5.4122,2.1239,3.2386,5.678,0.4936,4.4766,0.4946,0.2283,4.782,3.0849,4.4582,3.6469,0.724,4.5155,2.6759,4.8789,0.4526,0.1802,1.556,4.9152,7.889,5.4053,2.3254,1.0071,4.4408,3.0943,3.4724,0.0775,5.49,2.3733,1.7407,1.2075,0.0006,1.9174,2.0614,2.1511,4.0105,0.0308,0.5611,0.9783,1.3746,2.0634,0.4356,0.744,4.7624,0.6354,2.6878,2.1303,1.1064,2.0544,3.3802,5.4505,3.1857,6.8963,0.3248,3.0812,0.8642,1.4878,2.2013,3.9613,5.4262,4.1268,3.6153,4.8207,2.4633,7.5614,1.2209,0.0358,0.8811,4.0167,5.741,4.1004,0.1951,1.7071,4.4425,3.5919,2.2183,3.1598,5.8365,1.3975,1.1425,3.7521,1.7164,5.2518,2.7285,4.287,3.6135,1.7586,3.2975,0.7713,4.1655,3.0091,4.6489,1.9998,0.0056,3.7608,0.6742,0.5615,0.0002,1.9555,4.8872,0.3683,4.6239,2.7601,3.8692,4.5487,0.7125,0.3786,4.9134,0.5561,0.4853,1.6995,3.0752,0.0133,0.2293,0.5649,4.225,3.609,3.3204,0.6784,0.4801,0.2737,3.8061,5.8735,1.7129,2.7955,0.0039,2.9117,0.0164,0.3437,1.771,1.0173,4.2023,4.009,4.4404,1.9358,2.7007,0.9536,3.9587,0.084,0.7577,6.66,4.9753,4.5221,0.5144,0.0523,3.9906,0.0024,4.7355,0.0984,0.7386,2.0625,4.9632,1.6426,1.9226,5.5502,1.6604,0.8517,3.5195,0.6924,0.0693,1.5185,2.5486,1.0363,2.8952,4.2935,0.0792,0.3565,5.5714,5.0301,0.7933,3.3429,3.5627,3.1989,0.0157,1.575,5.5853,5.5903,0.1382,0.0023,0.9356,0.643,0.0002,4.2992,3.4732,2.7613,0.007,1.7084,0.7039,4.5169,4.5236,3.5201,2.3516,6.0292,3.2836,5.7977,3.5393,0.387,6.4576,0.0546,3.3814,2.3844,0.7473,1.3592,0.0023,1.4108,5.5746,0.2007,0.0426,0.0043,1.5842,2.959,2.2373,2.2264,5.1175,3.2274,5.9472,6.6937,0.0124,3.5118,2.93,1.9471,0.2317,1.7619,2.9716,3.5978,0.6915,5.8732,0.1462,2.7822,6.4336,0.2849,0.6762,2.5925,0.3282,0.2487,0.7019,0.1257,0.022,6.948,1.7471,6.0853,0.8759,0.3617,2.7515,0.0097,4.3466,0.0603,0.1103,0.0014,0.1267,4.1706,0.1423,0.0012,0.0019,0.5633,3.0864,0.6883,6.6691,1.9064,5.2765,4.1273,0.341,3.3714,2.5622,3.4708,3.1492,0.0353,0.227,1.3705,3.1613,0.1564,3.319,0.0101,0.0019,0.0006,2.309,0.4089,0.0002,4.2975,4.8015,3.2541,0.1569,1.7001,0.0855,1.1412,3.0551,5.2883,5.0912,5.1726,4.1233,0.2361,2.8126,1.526,4.2965,0.2038,3.9875,0.0313,0.8651,1.1921,3.8645,2.5322,2.5146,1.1433,1.0093,1.1854,4.0571,0.0004,0.4626,2.065,0.0002,7.4338,0.7402,3.0363,2.5537,2.9744,0.2165,2.0745,1.2825,1.2137,6.441,7.0385,5.8846,4.2212,3.3826,4.9052,3.9156,5.433,2.0264,4.7196,14.6215,2.6777,2.7464,1.1918,0.1459,2.5471,12.9852,0.5574,0.0222,2.2891,0.5692,11.5059,0.0857,0.0034,1.3795,0.362,0.7155,12.7567,0.0885,0.0017,0.5873,0.419,12.235,0.0563,0.0015,0.4459]}

One of his goals for the club came in the 6th minute against Everton in January 2008. He was not expected to start for the Premier League at the age of 19 after injuries forced the 19-year-old to make the move to Cambridge in 2009.\n\n\"It is something I've felt for a long time, both mentally and physically,\" said Ward. \"In my career I've been fortunate to have worked with a long list of young managers, so I've always wanted to try to reach my dreams in the Premier League. In the end, it was about me and the club, and I'm very happy that I got to where I am today. The main thing for me was just going through the process of getting back at Old Trafford, and I know I wanted to step up right away after my injuries and being able to use my game for many of the other clubs. My dream is to score the winning goal against Manchester United in Sunday's (June 25) FA Cup Final. The Premier League is a fantastic game and the way I can play throughout my career is something that is going to be exciting for me too.\"","token_len":370,"entropy":[8.5926,13.3332,8.4911,10.366,7.4994,1.1993,2.5767,1.3479,2.2273,19.0547,10.6122,5.5894,11.155,1.6519,3.9147,3.0024,4.0252,12.8827,9.1463,6.32,2.106,10.3528,4.8122,5.0143,5.4818,3.9255,6.7515,0.6677,4.2209,4.59,1.9882,1.3206,2.1778,2.4224,0.1013,0.5418,3.4173,0.0708,3.1521,0.0348,0.0027,2.1918,1.6717,4.0289,2.9381,4.3256,2.5142,4.9907,1.6935,0.1725,1.0143,0.6197,4.9441,2.3113,4.2888,3.7802,0.0136,0.7376,1.8311,2.7813,4.1619,0.0004,2.2942,7.446,0.268,1.6488,2.0236,2.9421,1.9142,1.0142,0.2105,1.727,3.167,4.4272,1.8182,0.7798,0.8713,1.1779,1.6668,6.4016,6.41,5.076,2.431,3.5243,2.7641,4.8683,7.7978,1.7622,0.7242,3.6807,0.0162,5.1699,0.7723,3.6662,0.2538,0.044,0.0294,0.0011,1.7672,1.185,0.0019,5.136,0.5807,1.0183,0.4776,1.7342,0.7066,2.2479,4.1163,2.796,6.6033,2.8567,1.2227,2.4807,0.0551,1.9853,3.6256,1.0788,2.8695,2.5189,4.5365,0.3803,5.9239,4.2987,6.9758,2.0261,0.3043,5.3699,0.6314,1.8853,3.6913,0.1257,0.0049,4.2531,3.4128,4.0474,0.0109,1.5693,0.6947,6.7084,0.3804,0.6981,2.4274,2.2924,1.1859,0.8525,2.3655,0.8003,1.0877,5.1034,0.776,0.0696,2.0834,3.7911,1.8484,4.0931,1.9402,1.2958,1.6799,1.9348,4.7952,7.0004,0.0318,3.8848,1.9436,0.6851,3.8827,0.0017,4.5282,0.9969,4.3405,0.0255,1.4219,4.3908,6.0052,2.0822,3.2054,4.3864,0.3045,0.0014,0.0218,0.0005,0.4612,4.6365,1.9075,1.9777,0.5821,3.9347,2.1658,4.2144,0.3835,0.6437,0.0002,5.3158,2.7357,1.6848,4.4838,0.7244,2.2321,4.9985,2.3595,1.0268,0.5311,0.0127,1.7391,6.1874,3.4215,0.0636,0.1995,0.9873,1.2576,7.7177,0.4334,0.0486,4.3164,1.8806,2.5972,1.0215,0.2531,1.8953,3.6773,1.1593,1.2872,3.4952,0.6259,1.8957,6.0875,1.5752,0.0133,3.2195,4.4837,1.3091,3.5462,0.9788,2.0428,1.5551,3.1121,0.0437,3.8306,1.7361,4.4366,2.5715,4.3911,3.5305,1.7836,1.436,0.0017,0.4965,4.0335,1.8439,2.4416,0.9481,1.9508,1.055,3.5963,4.7402,2.3917,1.9908,1.052,1.7726,0.9799,1.5962,1.8622,1.8763,1.1462,2.5051,0.432,2.6275,1.359,5.1756,0.0212,0.0373,1.2127,0.884,3.392,5.708,0.3478,2.3283,0.0471,1.9183,3.5497,5.6174,2.4164,1.0869,1.4128,0.605,1.8743,2.4408,4.1652,8.1718,0.2449,1.7289,0.9084,1.904,4.3841,1.3576,5.9285,0.0853,6.9265,0.7478,8.5785,0.2656,5.4876,2.7282,6.0292,1.6995,5.1975,1.9456,0.001,6.1972,0.5941,4.6044,3.5402,5.6484,3.9059,0.8552,3.7771,2.0479,2.268,4.7421,5.7955,1.1639,0.3994,5.9853,3.8715,4.534,0.2288,3.0961,1.9496,0.3134,2.0716,5.2135,0.0401,8.2398,6.7526,3.2822,0.2524,0.2752,0.0006,3.9678,1.4855,3.4492,4.0689,0.0016,0.7051,1.3931,2.2798,3.378,1.7424,3.1521,3.9878,0.6396,4.0496,1.481,7.9594,2.9383,0.0828,1.3503,2.6529,1.6376,3.278,1.9595,0.0101,1.4625,4.6374,0.6671,0.5107,4.6417,0.6847]}

In late January this year, Prime Minister Abdullati launched Operation Iraqi Freedom in the northern bank of the El-Shiaq River. When asked to explain a statement about the operation, the PM stated simply in Arabic that Operation Iraqi Freedom is a joint military operation by the security forces of Iraq and KRSA (Iraq and PKK).","token_len":370,"entropy":[11.3335,2.5448,6.8578,5.691,6.1396,7.9623,2.9184,7.2243,4.7337,0.0258,2.3438,7.4529,4.1689,1.0207,5.2501,1.9456,5.377,6.5005,6.3278,6.9923,0.0254,1.8,8.0478,1.8771,12.0284,6.2271,0.5134,1.435,3.4259,1.5851,3.1656,7.9037,1.2023,6.4076,1.4156,0.091,1.0011,0.2589,6.8145,2.4656,3.4847,3.0299,4.08,4.533,5.0198,0.1916,1.6139,2.8906,4.4467,5.1381,3.7,2.119,6.1077,1.1395,5.3902,0.2562,1.5937,1.9705,2.0963,6.8231,1.8729,5.4892,3.6033,4.1181,1.7852,0.8498,0.0021,4.2707,6.1957,6.405,3.9794,0.3665,2.4804,4.1292,6.7646,1.4809,4.7253,0.0328,0.0787,0.5905,6.6986,2.7226,6.9733,2.529,2.946,4.1833,5.9537,0.8235,6.3146,6.0353,7.7441,9.0715,1.9253,3.2423,5.9964,5.4222,4.3618,0.1996,3.5116,4.6699,0.0151,0.0292,8.546,1.8192,2.4833,0.1333,0.1717,0.1273,1.1229,4.6846,0.1806,3.6704,1.3576,6.0485,6.3998,0.7608,3.2693,5.233,9.0495,5.8369,3.1672,2.1933,4.6118,0.0024,7.1176,1.351,4.8673,6.2927,0.6094,1.1519,0.0002,2.7153,3.8784,4.7598,0.3825,0.657,0.2061,5.1541,5.7998,0.5698,3.7624,7.2086,2.2348,0.0334,6.11,4.9228,0.9782,3.7425,0.9837,5.1499,1.5275,4.2942,4.2163,2.2588,2.2085,1.4335,5.3054,5.8849,1.4502,3.7892,0.6959,5.2506,5.6023,0.9981,5.2264,4.2107,2.5421,3.4084,4.8345,1.9711,1.3261,5.1074,7.126,0.0145,1.451,4.7547,2.3409,1.4364,2.8217,5.0374,1.2649,1.9497,3.9269,3.8565,3.6179,1.2238,1.3583,3.2389,0.8639,1.772,1.1455,0.2989,1.3691,6.3246,0.0589,4.292,1.0087,4.6441,2.6943,3.8986,0.9066,6.8745,5.1682,1.6799,5.6362,6.244,4.4772,0.1442,0.5129,1.9704,1.2133,2.2593,5.9605,0.0837,0.6165,3.3867,0.2349,0.2939,0.0002,4.0474,3.5168,5.1649,3.2454,3.1745,2.3715,3.7812,1.4662,4.6841,0.0245,1.2396,0.976,0.016,6.0903,2.3203,0.0639,4.246,1.8715,0.3674,1.989,0.9396,3.3013,0.0113,1.3575,2.8194,4.8213,0.0327,2.8712,2.9878,0.2828,2.1306,4.1596,0.9936,2.9437,0.2542,0.5403,5.2083,0.2123,0.4595,3.4103,0.6857,0.1471,0.8546,1.9131,1.213,3.5476,3.3945,0.7774,4.6999,0.007,2.5495,17.3798,0.0879,6.0233,3.8538,3.0317,7.8462,0.299,0.2109,4.8465,2.7562,0.0388,0.7311,5.0329,1.7031,7.9869,3.3893,0.3874,0.0177,0.0244,0.5732,0.9335,5.017,5.0413,0.539,1.7728,6.4286,1.7418,2.1358,3.5409,4.1693,0.4904,2.563,4.263,3.474,4.1053,0.0786,0.0954,3.9784,0.0064,2.0168,0.1842,0.0014,0.0069,5.1036,1.3006,1.7409,0.013,1.8955,1.5344,2.1135,6.2688,0.0306,0.0264,0.7386,0.0784,0.0365,0.0033,0.0016,0.5283,1.0688,7.261,3.3814,2.8851,1.8302,5.71,4.8726,4.3977,0.5733,2.4548,0.4423,1.9956,2.2722,3.2907,7.0516,6.526,2.2051,1.5272,4.531,0.0417,0.0002,1.8274,1.6667,2.6265,3.453,1.0662,3.6996,0.5253,5.673,0.2119,0.7898,1.0276,0.4608,5.3801,0.041,5.3174,3.3784,3.2956,8.5987,1.1244]}

{"id":2930,"ended":true,"length":360,"text":"The duplication and transmission of genetic material from one generation of cells to the next is the basis for molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms' DNA can be linked to one another by DNA, thereby linking them into one common entity, the 'Molecular Information' (MII), an important reference for understanding the genetic processes in cells and of the structure of complex molecular networks. Although this reference can be regarded primarily as a basis for the understanding of the molecular system involved in the formation, the introduction of DNA into our cells is one of the main reasons and major obstacle in the development of genetic networks. DNA has only two basic properties, namely, the ability to encode DNA and the ability to transport DNA from cell tissues and organs to be read as a sample. This is reflected in its use today in sequencing, and its use in the understanding of molecular processes. Genetic networks are based on the premise that DNA, like all other information in the genome, must be processed in small numbers, and that RNA, which requires RNA to be translated into a molecular molecule, is often translated into a nucleic acid. DNA can thus represent a huge complex of information, which is to be understood as a long molecule of the DNA sequence\n\nTransmitted Information (TIF). The structure, syntax, and details of DNA reflect the sequence of the molecule within which it is originally copied. Because the sequence of the molecule appears to represent the sequence of the molecule and therefore has a strong resemblance of the sequence of the DNA sequence, i.e. the sequence of the DNA sequence which is usually the primary strand of that molecule, DNA analysis (such as MII) can be performed on these sequences to confirm that the sequence of the DNA sequence of the molecule is identical with that of the first sequence of that molecule.","token_len":371,"entropy":[12.5811,2.9305,6.3585,0.2122,4.2374,1.4148,2.8961,1.3515,3.7457,3.1702,3.91,0.2267,1.1268,0.0202,1.5188,3.2639,4.044,0.6319,4.9557,4.4342,1.7138,1.7851,2.3168,6.2018,0.2399,2.4131,8.9696,2.448,3.0894,10.927,1.7249,4.0879,5.6391,9.62,0.1743,6.3278,3.4118,3.4545,0.6097,5.2691,0.5043,3.7426,0.1722,1.6857,4.4592,4.4129,5.8198,4.0982,1.7979,3.3366,2.8862,3.7827,5.544,1.888,2.8238,4.1974,7.3947,1.0407,0.4264,5.9669,3.7728,1.7474,1.3037,3.4617,1.7451,5.3198,3.8801,4.8073,2.3722,1.929,1.2508,3.1824,3.6834,3.4433,3.7184,1.7691,5.2415,1.9239,4.2403,0.6675,4.521,4.477,3.2419,0.2938,5.1894,2.9046,5.5885,3.9149,0.6262,5.2076,6.921,0.1652,0.8304,5.8902,0.1208,2.3117,2.8308,0.0428,1.6281,1.7239,5.2214,6.0292,0.4457,1.6024,2.4567,2.8481,4.8451,6.5107,0.1466,2.898,0.6436,4.5381,1.5035,2.4028,3.2855,0.4276,0.161,2.8099,2.4989,6.116,5.8289,6.3901,2.7788,0.65,0.9779,0.0801,3.9197,5.2612,0.4687,4.689,2.5048,5.249,2.9047,2.2436,2.959,1.6967,1.6604,1.4907,2.85,1.5798,0.0044,4.4457,3.886,1.7123,1.1282,0.4786,0.0158,4.7528,2.4915,2.1226,2.8389,8.9801,3.176,2.1217,0.7464,3.8213,5.2114,3.2792,1.8904,9.2713,1.0777,3.3632,1.3508,4.5677,0.2096,2.3108,5.4027,7.6827,1.2672,6.0899,1.9061,2.2533,2.5268,3.0212,0.6735,1.7253,4.6046,0.0605,2.6984,1.9641,1.3961,4.9785,1.5472,1.1731,3.7731,0.1744,1.0718,6.583,0.1061,3.2946,3.7421,3.62,2.0696,1.1529,2.8496,2.4718,0.6674,2.036,0.062,3.0233,0.2348,5.1179,1.3976,6.6316,4.0723,1.715,1.494,1.0601,6.1475,2.0144,2.184,6.3976,5.0856,2.1315,0.8119,3.2888,0.705,3.1721,5.2067,2.1457,0.1849,1.5453,5.7685,3.9863,0.318,1.8352,4.6014,1.6668,0.0058,0.9831,3.826,2.5482,3.4361,4.8225,1.3116,6.2001,6.3597,0.8937,1.4515,1.1476,2.5126,1.4752,4.8128,2.735,1.7777,1.338,0.8215,6.9263,5.5553,2.2907,4.269,3.2629,3.0058,8.051,0.0064,6.2626,6.3859,3.7805,2.3545,1.3108,1.467,3.8535,1.922,5.5002,3.2758,6.9024,0.4917,0.6863,7.2925,0.0402,2.6547,7.5918,0.823,4.3004,0.4086,1.4363,3.8203,4.7347,0.9059,0.9435,0.4802,7.0322,6.2786,1.0102,4.983,2.2071,2.5195,0.2221,1.4659,0.7905,5.5624,0.9313,5.9123,1.7082,2.1225,0.0995,1.1784,2.47,4.258,3.3273,3.2632,1.6601,5.0753,1.8715,7.0759,1.2446,1.6069,0.1597,0.7959,2.4744,2.3256,0.7091,8.4062,0.0025,0.0008,0.941,1.5492,1.6078,0.3012,0.7793,2.3818,1.698,5.2534,1.1361,6.0085,3.3317,5.4754,6.7649,0.7359,5.428,0.7799,0.569,4.2431,8.0797,4.3969,5.2649,0.0082,6.1232,1.5575,0.6597,1.3347,1.5175,1.3425,1.584,3.8006,1.3266,0.7255,3.3759,1.1018,0.7288,1.3322,0.9383,0.3287,2.8852,0.7619,4.5852,0.5714,0.2925,0.7388,1.7613,1.9576,1.1341,0.0835,0.1962,6.5545,3.3144,0.8073,1.8545,0.2212,0.471]}
{"id":305,"ended":false,"length":366,"text":"According to Church teaching, respect for human life requires respect for one's own body, precluding unhealthy behavior, the abuse of food, alcohol, medicines, illegal drugs, tattoos and clothing, which is considered a sign of 'fear'; a sign that one \"is not afraid to hurt one another, against one's own will\", and also that one considers the world in their proper \"favour\". The Christian Church has no \"right\" to force someone into doing a sin. And because the \"right\" of any individual, whether human or divine, to be free and to be loved, and that of others, must be respected by all, we only have to act only against the self if by the self we must act on good deeds, in favor and in defense of Jesus as Lord to all those he may be able to make in his own behalf. That is why we have all to live a \"selfless life\", always on our own accord, in order for the rest of us to be in complete service to both God and our Father, all who are given the honor of serving his name to him.\n\nSo, according to the Christian Church values of respect for God, respect and love for oneself, and love for others, how can we continue to support and support one another? How can the Christian Community do further in supporting one another? What can be done? And why is it important to support one another in this way?\n\nToday I want to share what I see and hear of this phenomenon. I have read about it for many of the Christian Churches and I have talked to many Christian churches about it and I always agree, they are the ones the ones doing the right things to encourage other people to act positively and do good things, by helping others too.

{"id":15,"ended":false,"length":333,"text":"With the losing continuing, more rumors began to surface. Unlike before, the rumors were about player moves rather than coaching changes. The majority of rumors were that the Blue Jackets would like to bring on the 30-year-old defenseman who has a strong NHL pedigree. With the Columbus Blue Jackets, it makes sense that they would consider getting on-ice with the 33-year-old. But now, they have more new offers for the goalie.\nAccording to a report by Niko Kovac, the Blue Jackets are looking to bring back Markstrom for a sixth-year, if not fourth.\nThis was reported before, but now, he has two years left on his contract.\nKovac also noted that Columbus have had interest in defenseman Brandon Saad for years as well. Now, he may be making some moves in his pursuit of Saad \u2014 and perhaps the Blue Jackets may want to bring on the veteran for a fourth straight year.\nKovac is the Blue Jackets general manager in charge of both management and coaching options, and he has seen significant success with both his team and coaching staff. The veteran has led the Blue Jackets to five wins in their first six games and to a 13-10-5 record, despite being out without key forwards Michael Stone and James Tarkowski. His coaching staff has been as good as their players.\nKovac will keep his job for at least another season at the minimum, but after that, he could look to bring him back next season.\nWith Saad being out for only nine months, most would prefer that the Columbus Blue Jackets keep him on that contract. Some would love a fourth year of the star defenseman, but these suggestions are likely to be the ones that will bring the Blue Jackets to the door this year.\nShare this: Twitter\nFacebook","token_len":371,"entropy":[2.3156,10.4337,13.1671,1.7243,6.6112,9.1119,3.3619,0.5774,1.9557,2.0924,8.4334,3.8649,0.1518,1.8442,4.2904,1.407,4.6158,8.4311,6.1628,4.7686,0.0065,6.3186,2.0035,0.5213,2.4271,6.9662,0.1808,3.3395,1.3949,4.2037,1.7982,5.377,0.8143,1.3055,5.6188,0.1866,3.4721,4.8935,3.7079,6.9601,0.4002,0.2638,0.1509,0.0012,3.9094,3.9223,1.8165,3.4031,3.1036,4.2646,1.7183,0.831,4.9934,1.445,5.1581,0.3022,0.0034,3.245,2.6123,5.1571,0.1831,1.4686,1.7469,0.647,4.2794,5.4509,3.4903,5.0552,0.2618,4.1982,1.878,5.2599,0.0181,0.0015,0.0138,0.0008,1.8863,4.195,4.7532,1.2055,3.5104,1.707,4.9187,6.6633,6.7031,2.6735,1.4622,5.02,0.9568,0.5823,13.3976,0.0024,2.6048,1.08,1.6394,6.5611,6.1189,5.3438,1.1448,1.5209,0.8102,0.9413,0.0008,1.2833,1.9477,0.6946,2.2454,3.3833,6.4199,6.6759,2.7322,1.233,5.2969,3.1032,2.2263,2.344,4.7584,0.3802,5.3845,3.888,2.5075,3.6785,3.6526,2.2398,4.4042,3.116,0.6581,2.8669,1.9427,4.6304,1.9871,4.6277,0.7552,0.6748,0.1626,0.177,0.4822,0.6746,1.8923,2.7436,0.0139,0.004,2.0385,2.7505,0.3087,3.5211,4.4647,4.0605,3.207,0.3851,4.2842,4.8836,1.4173,0.0004,1.7121,3.1156,4.8853,0.2177,0.4099,5.0889,0.2891,2.1924,5.1344,1.0285,4.7986,3.7575,2.3305,2.7839,2.0509,4.7624,0.2698,2.4287,0.0016,6.9801,2.3875,3.8086,2.712,1.0017,0.0006,4.7694,2.9324,0.154,2.8148,1.0854,2.0513,2.3756,2.6866,1.0726,2.194,4.5556,0.5452,0.2345,0.3406,2.9715,0.0698,0.0019,3.8127,3.159,5.094,0.0186,4.4632,0.0021,4.2632,0.4688,0.018,6.1002,5.2361,0.38,1.9381,8.1664,2.1486,1.1786,1.0063,1.5802,4.1911,5.2339,1.9587,0.9843,3.39,2.8591,3.0312,0.1269,3.6117,0.4025,0.5246,2.7847,5.0404,1.2328,4.6289,0.5708,1.0611,0.0002,0.3133,3.5631,2.6949,0.6568,3.3247,3.5634,2.1039,0.3192,1.7956,5.1543,1.1948,4.7876,0.0402,3.0655,0.2518,2.0413,0.0913,2.7416,5.0727,2.4423,2.9658,7.256,5.0385,3.3294,4.4946,5.155,0.4253,4.9844,7.3804,6.5143,3.6385,0.2892,4.7149,4.9288,1.2428,1.0741,1.9422,5.4218,1.3011,0.1838,4.6117,4.8641,2.2439,0.6155,2.2664,0.0334,0.0014,4.4271,5.8674,2.6999,1.8847,2.9396,2.0763,0.002,1.0992,1.7924,3.9866,0.8144,6.9527,1.6214,1.3778,5.586,1.1056,0.5511,0.858,1.9151,4.5442,0.3319,2.4226,3.9644,0.3915,4.2743,0.4387,0.5572,1.0238,3.2329,2.9681,0.0036,4.1504,2.2239,1.0168,4.6554,4.7383,2.6809,0.7732,6.4682,3.46,5.4203,1.9529,1.4059,4.6713,0.2022,0.0003,3.5137,0.9096,2.2788,5.1976,2.0001,0.6978,6.4575,1.8974,5.2601,3.3894,4.2827,1.2031,2.7602,3.1606,6.5873,1.4685,1.05,0.7103,5.8113,5.8659,1.2277,4.1075,0.6851,0.8886,4.252,2.0267,0.8706,2.786,4.1673,1.2154,0.7665,0.0001,1.8627,0.9839,7.1942,5.7144,2.2537,0.1593,0.772,6.9028,0.1791,0.1602,0.6936,0.0016,13.3682]}

He told different stories to different people, and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he continued to torture women in the US.\n\nIn addition to the usual theories regarding what, if any, Bundy had, Bundy used a small amount of drugs in exchange for having the chance to talk through \"the good stuff\" (so-called \"drugs\" ). He told people to keep quiet about his alleged \"sickness\" and said \"I don't drink very much... and I don't smoke and I don't play drugs\". That means he admitted he used a drug to torture women and had said \"I drink very much\".\n\nBundy also talked about his relationship with his \"toxic masculinity\", as people described it as \"men being men and women being men\". As we've seen Bundy did \"steal\" women's secrets and used them to kill many women, including the mother of his first son, and she tried to rape him, all because he couldn't stop it.\n\nTo that end, Bundy took his wife and children, using them for his \"sex game\" and to kill some women. At the same time Bundy also attempted to rape one woman (Tess). At one point, Bundy was captured in her house using torture methods (Tess, Bundy, and his wife) where they took the bodies of another woman and turned those out on a television... where they were filmed doing similar things, and Bundy killed them for his sexual needs.\n\nBundy may still be alive at some point and might not be in prison today, but the woman who raped him must certainly be willing to testify about the way Bundy \"gave her\" a job that left her with nothing but fear and anger.","token_len":371,"entropy":[2.8744,1.2771,6.172,1.1886,3.6672,2.529,1.9138,11.2058,4.8573,4.7916,4.4311,1.4282,2.6238,4.1664,9.7945,0.8128,3.0907,2.6039,1.1222,1.3073,1.3552,7.3627,0.0793,5.1546,0.0002,1.9403,3.7765,0.3878,0.8108,9.2982,3.9237,1.8021,3.6363,2.2618,0.8114,3.6376,0.1638,5.6184,1.7243,2.5509,1.7883,4.8611,0.9619,0.8714,0.0006,2.6192,4.6573,0.5866,1.9783,7.1289,6.4423,4.6713,3.036,5.9714,0.5138,1.5377,0.0395,5.1248,3.1723,6.6126,4.3743,6.0921,2.3759,4.5445,2.4633,0.0055,4.5371,2.2389,5.5417,0.0047,5.8594,3.2056,3.964,0.0506,4.9598,7.6576,5.8693,1.9742,6.1368,2.3388,1.1677,3.8816,6.252,1.4898,0.0169,0.6174,3.9178,0.235,2.4682,8.0323,2.1193,3.0654,3.0034,2.5507,3.4164,2.1574,0.9347,1.3901,5.1456,3.6052,4.5361,2.6074,1.4316,0.5377,0.9717,3.9902,3.5126,1.3824,2.2228,0.0007,4.9641,5.4631,0.1446,5.185,3.9407,0.4954,1.3294,0.0004,1.9391,4.3828,0.2403,0.3012,0.0003,4.1789,3.8095,2.5778,5.468,5.7971,0.8277,6.1708,2.0972,3.1307,2.8615,4.0132,2.7222,5.5448,0.8292,2.143,3.8127,6.2458,2.4484,0.6396,5.5971,2.5684,1.0519,2.2888,0.786,0.0002,2.0675,0.0052,2.2285,4.6208,0.3464,1.9525,3.9851,0.0429,1.2699,3.6156,5.5935,4.4658,2.8584,1.6063,4.0148,5.0371,3.9508,2.749,1.2391,0.8047,6.4086,3.7606,3.5731,1.8418,0.7529,0.074,4.5997,0.8412,4.6891,4.5052,1.8348,0.7555,3.5193,4.6446,4.5934,4.9596,1.9539,0.4178,1.4332,1.0167,5.9409,1.8392,4.566,1.032,0.6258,3.7301,5.0083,1.0814,1.5462,1.6179,2.9924,4.6391,0.144,2.0142,4.5268,3.8129,1.0172,2.6494,5.9093,5.6461,0.0789,3.8147,0.5547,2.2932,5.6207,2.4004,0.8361,5.0291,0.0005,2.8093,3.1901,0.2582,0.7461,0.0002,5.8818,5.0396,0.3952,0.2178,0.6901,4.6659,2.7028,2.7059,1.4531,1.1314,2.786,7.1848,1.3408,2.669,2.2423,2.2824,4.2775,4.947,0.8966,1.2121,3.5272,3.5453,5.0767,1.5595,1.2994,4.8149,2.2662,1.8978,0.0042,4.1105,3.2771,4.8008,0.0506,3.2121,4.3757,1.3994,4.285,6.4779,5.9661,4.3954,4.2454,0.6376,0.041,0.8233,1.3908,3.0055,4.582,3.0663,6.1784,2.8302,5.1881,6.9552,3.5371,3.2226,5.0652,0.6786,3.3412,3.2319,1.4166,1.3541,2.6699,1.0951,1.799,7.5189,3.2816,4.3601,2.755,3.4126,0.8003,5.5999,0.6443,1.5499,5.8585,6.01,7.6595,3.8721,2.6288,6.1288,7.454,4.5086,1.2231,2.6049,2.9801,4.4304,5.7137,0.5396,3.0556,2.2818,3.4693,4.6967,3.0157,4.1213,2.8893,4.3066,7.1579,0.3433,0.3918,0.0002,1.8628,0.0058,6.237,5.6378,0.4939,0.9733,4.5364,3.4123,0.0936,2.8409,5.6393,2.9262,0.7939,3.199,1.3164,4.2412,0.8553,0.3013,2.8389,7.4472,1.0541,3.3481,0.7176,5.3917,6.5449,0.6365,7.8804,0.0335,1.5025,2.4836,2.1207,5.161,2.5115,4.193,4.9031,1.1812,1.7733,1.9994,3.6297,5.2792,3.9535,5.3224,0.1879,2.1284,3.2086,1.1921,5.3093,0.8896,4.8006,0.5875]}

The defeat of the Democrats in the 113th Congress, the Democrats were shocked by the loss of the majority of votes, their first time out of the Senate since their former rule. But now McCain continues to be an important voice, the most sensitive point not lost on the American people.\n\nIf you believe that McCain lost the presidency because of his speech to Congress, or if you believe that he lost because of his comments about military bases and how we treat our kids, then the Senate must be left to deal with that loss. McCain\u2019s speech to Congress was a very clear line to draw. It spoke of the importance of defending our country at home and abroad. McCain was speaking a message of peace, defense, and security, but he did not speak about protecting the U.S. against aggression, aggression, or war. Rather, he spoke of preserving our democratic ideals and values, that should be the guiding principle for all Americans, regardless of their party affiliation. So don\u2019t give the Democrats and the Republicans the opportunity to have McCain speak to the American people in this manner. They can\u2019t do as well as they wish.\n\nWhy would McCain have left politics to serve as Chairman of the Armed Services Committee when all those years have passed when he served as majority of the Senate? Because he is president of the United States of America, and as a result, he has to sit on both the Senate and the Congress and be sworn into the office. The loss of McCain makes it clear that the way McCain will talk to the American people will be more than just \u201cpolitics.\u201d","token_len":371,"entropy":[9.0388,0.5074,1.0325,5.8404,1.4187,0.7565,6.1447,6.3303,1.981,1.4787,4.354,1.579,1.192,6.1248,0.0023,0.1022,0.4349,1.6815,3.4379,5.4831,7.0907,2.1088,8.0249,5.0651,0.4975,2.6217,1.5048,7.7375,1.6117,1.1289,0.2384,1.25,3.0345,0.0042,0.0487,2.3698,2.9031,5.7046,3.9148,2.3357,3.7018,0.6804,2.8638,6.9353,0.5057,1.6656,3.4561,1.158,0.3378,2.0435,0.0189,0.192,2.3976,2.4458,4.6041,3.5965,8.9933,1.7624,0.6244,3.865,0.2155,1.7646,2.3947,2.0069,3.2359,3.254,6.0648,4.1252,5.4162,5.9424,0.5979,0.7143,1.6212,1.4206,5.0752,7.5114,6.1113,1.6474,4.7976,4.5767,2.6922,5.3981,0.1359,1.2869,3.5866,1.4658,3.2234,3.5508,3.9927,3.3052,8.5128,5.018,7.6635,5.486,0.4768,1.1032,2.2941,0.2025,0.6327,0.8387,0.0013,4.926,1.7491,4.2815,1.0562,1.8797,5.2273,1.3473,2.5143,0.6983,0.6844,1.1767,6.5586,1.9834,2.3098,1.167,3.5178,2.9488,0.2516,0.4923,0.3075,1.7675,1.6353,1.2046,0.2307,0.7378,4.8059,1.5241,5.6614,5.4709,1.995,3.7297,3.9901,6.2483,1.8146,7.0014,0.6684,1.8481,3.3897,4.1007,3.6232,1.3383,6.0862,1.48,5.3529,0.0178,2.9429,5.6364,0.6485,3.2257,13.4281,10.024,2.5105,1.0856,2.1766,0.1184,1.1681,1.6722,4.1449,3.7831,6.5463,3.1168,2.3985,1.6399,2.3761,4.0116,1.7405,1.0391,2.1719,0.0412,4.5215,0.8283,1.817,5.4747,0.1808,0.3907,0.8729,1.2004,3.0398,2.3946,3.3796,5.5322,2.7777,1.5581,3.8714,1.4464,5.7888,0.9245,0.4502,3.084,1.7457,3.1526,1.1868,3.0595,0.2754,2.5227,1.6148,6.241,1.467,3.6933,0.0008,0.0029,0.0403,4.424,4.8866,3.055,4.3697,2.634,0.6067,2.4829,0.2736,3.8863,0.2188,0.2473,0.6814,1.0565,5.5531,1.2901,4.9884,4.6194,1.1753,2.1971,1.4338,4.8595,5.9958,0.8257,2.3782,4.0726,1.3504,1.8963,1.7315,0.8494,2.2702,2.0107,0.0028,1.5846,2.1523,1.6111,0.4629,5.7771,6.6296,4.6722,3.7365,0.0488,4.514,2.6952,3.0194,3.2088,1.6092,0.6413,1.433,2.7667,0.0351,5.0944,4.5603,2.5355,2.34,1.8612,0.2541,0.0372,2.4563,3.1444,2.7268,0.3581,4.044,3.2393,5.5317,0.4948,0.0088,1.7068,7.4797,2.8543,1.6422,1.1077,4.9211,0.5404,0.5089,0.0001,6.1349,2.9936,1.1829,3.8293,6.3458,6.0199,1.4853,3.8031,1.8529,4.537,0.0808,0.0638,2.0828,0.0318,0.0392,3.0342,4.6678,4.2282,3.7342,2.9105,0.7816,5.143,0.9848,4.2569,0.7044,6.4287,6.5691,0.28,1.2856,2.2491,2.6067,1.0738,2.5768,5.972,1.3792,0.1264,0.1862,0.0016,2.1344,0.0033,1.5562,0.8411,3.826,2.2263,1.7621,1.202,0.933,1.5802,3.9908,6.2001,1.8387,5.2629,0.4282,2.0939,1.2076,0.7841,7.1454,3.3092,2.7981,5.7503,3.1896,3.1925,1.9114,2.5976,2.7757,6.3288,0.0827,2.2531,4.4953,1.2226,2.2794,0.3075,1.4998,5.596,4.7295,3.2966,5.9215,1.3737,0.7242,0.0322,0.0341,2.8361,1.2175,4.5116,2.522,1.0956,12.299,6.811,7.2473,0.8213,8.5076,6.4087]}

Once stopped a few minutes later, the wheels are turned off by linear motorized traction control.\nIt also has two speed bumps, which is an added bonus.\nAnother bonus being the electric roller coaster has a power steering system with both brakes on.\nThe roller coaster has one speed bump, though it is powered by a 20 year old electric motor, instead of the old 220-degree battery. That means you won\u2019t experience much more speed compared to an old 220-degree battery powered power steering system, but it keeps everything running smoothly.\nOne last perk to this roller coaster ride is you can see out of the tunnel \u2014 you won\u2019t see a single person out of sight due to the high visibility of the tunnel.\nA special trip that is made possible thanks to the use of our $200 gift cards.

{"id":3193,"ended":false,"length":350,"text":"The term'heavy metal ', as it was used by Lester Bangs and Dave Marsh at Creem, referred to a sound best exemplified by albums such as Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin II.  When the band was originally called'Heavy Metal', the first release \"Metal, the Second Coming \", was later released in a two- CD pack on cassette by British label Bloch Records. \" Metal, the Second Coming\" was an album containing the liner notes for all three bands.  In the original name, 'Metal, the Second Coming', this album was called Heavy Metal and was released on September 4, 1988.  The name was due to the band's two songs from the album 'Metal' (one being \"The Other Way\") titled 'The Other Way' and 'The Metal That Has Broken'. The first song 'The Other Way' was written by Carl Bernstein and played in the 'Metal' demo during the first few minutes of the demo.\n\n\" Metal is the Second Coming \" was in the band's third song, \" The Other Way \". The original title of the song was \" Metal \" because of the title of the second part, or \" The Other Way\". Both songs and songs that were released in 1968 and 1969, \" Metal, the Second Coming \" were both released on CD. The title is derived from the use of the word \"metal\" in their songs.  They both contained liner notes, although the original song was recorded in the basement of a London home where the singer of \u201c Metal \u201c was killed in April 1968.\n\nOther songs on \"Metal: The Second Coming \" are both included in the album \" Metal'(as opposed to \" The Other Way\" from the album \" Metal \" ). \" Metal\" was released on DVD in late October 1992.\n\nReferences","token_len":372,"entropy":[7.9794,7.4743,12.9124,6.6035,10.7831,4.3537,1.7757,2.3392,2.7456,1.4931,10.3391,4.4696,1.0206,2.1646,5.1915,7.4341,3.9809,10.3158,3.673,2.588,6.623,0.0909,2.3123,4.9074,9.9014,5.4773,0.0075,0.2589,8.537,1.2306,0.0039,6.4192,0.0044,0.0018,1.2507,5.1726,0.0033,0.0197,1.7722,2.2774,7.1151,11.1565,2.3074,2.7323,2.4688,5.6015,2.9768,8.4131,3.4725,0.1166,0.9779,1.772,3.6847,5.6997,7.7035,3.3617,5.4695,4.9212,5.8508,1.8649,7.0342,0.7806,6.1498,4.3714,2.6586,2.5204,5.69,0.3155,8.7917,5.9262,4.4076,3.5751,3.8267,6.1011,1.5249,6.4868,5.61,1.6214,0.6793,6.0886,4.5277,0.9331,0.2267,0.1492,0.0024,1.5224,0.9567,3.7652,1.9665,5.1595,2.1506,6.1593,0.0172,1.6389,5.3897,1.6173,4.1228,1.8249,2.0085,2.8088,1.8408,4.4881,6.9694,0.829,2.9077,0.816,1.1511,0.2535,0.1158,0.0018,2.6436,3.6056,2.3798,0.7853,1.5561,5.6203,0.0353,2.8914,0.8379,2.0574,1.4158,3.8793,3.4153,0.0833,4.4301,0.6012,1.2508,1.7658,3.2695,1.9642,8.5389,0.0502,0.7224,3.8198,0.407,6.0981,3.2628,4.4362,0.7264,1.8439,1.384,1.7956,2.6897,2.9587,4.8029,3.3008,2.2009,3.0294,4.8935,6.0521,1.7022,5.6487,0.5411,2.6198,1.3729,0.0942,1.0436,0.6851,0.8165,1.9139,3.9872,4.8561,4.2158,5.8892,2.415,2.235,3.0847,2.7102,2.2499,2.2742,0.7327,0.0008,0.1231,0.5026,2.3211,0.4838,5.9815,4.4251,1.4137,3.7093,2.3372,0.6709,3.2904,1.3155,1.2056,5.9463,4.5867,0.5058,2.857,3.8894,2.1978,0.1217,0.3887,2.6575,0.717,3.3617,0.073,4.0059,1.2755,6.0187,2.1651,4.6711,0.0109,1.6711,1.9264,5.4666,1.5032,3.9297,0.144,3.8883,5.2102,1.5134,1.2499,2.8001,1.0443,0.015,2.4165,1.8888,4.9332,1.9282,1.2455,0.659,0.9402,0.8134,1.1311,2.8522,4.97,4.4556,2.159,0.652,3.2099,1.1514,0.4677,3.1341,3.4265,3.8256,6.6236,2.0733,1.8494,0.6706,0.026,3.6877,6.3388,1.0395,5.5037,3.7671,3.8306,1.028,2.1873,1.2729,6.2954,2.2972,0.9999,2.9401,2.6394,1.1547,1.1435,0.2237,0.0743,0.0085,1.1543,0.774,4.9752,2.0311,1.1122,3.1741,1.9682,1.954,3.727,4.2431,2.8809,0.0272,0.4502,5.7717,0.0491,0.3351,1.3021,1.6897,1.9901,0.2651,0.7248,5.3572,3.8273,0.9592,1.8064,4.6704,3.1931,4.1253,8.9034,0.0027,2.603,4.3941,1.081,3.4703,2.4102,1.4171,3.7993,1.5162,1.5693,5.5744,0.3655,1.9205,4.6467,3.5687,2.6341,1.148,5.0829,4.8159,12.8299,5.4167,3.3826,3.7881,0.2357,0.7726,5.8303,1.3223,4.8548,1.9353,0.4437,1.719,0.0002,5.8801,2.7976,3.7263,3.3262,2.0799,5.1988,0.9064,0.3997,0.0083,4.2025,3.6892,5.6921,4.3969,0.6682,0.5831,1.6691,2.4668,1.6749,7.3379,7.3492,5.979,3.2402,0.0034,1.7935,1.9798,0.2097,0.0017,2.4593,5.6768,0.7798,0.712,2.0972,0.937,4.6583,2.426,3.4731,0.3091,1.5243,1.3157,2.1816,0.8404,5.4297,1.3236,4.2472,3.3172,4.0856,1.0499,1.6698,0.0002,5.1874]}

PA 261 was first designated in May 1920 as PA 261, then passed as part of Highway Route 182 into service in July, 1920. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (now called the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation) originally determined that PA 261 through the Delaware border would be a rural highway. It was then changed to PA 263 and moved on. PA 263 through the Delaware border would continue to be the state highway through which Pennsylvania's highways and highways became part of and continue along the Delaware river. That means that PA 261 through Pennsylvania's Delaware border will remain the state highway through which Pennsylvania's national highways have become part and continue through.\n\nThe Pennsylvania State Highway Act was passed by the Pennsylvania legislature to establish Pennsylvania's Interstate Highway Transportation Board. It was created to create a system of highway transportation that ran along Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's northeastern border. Interstate Highway is the state highway through which most areas of Pennsylvania use roads. The Pennsylvania State Highway Act states that all sections of the highway should be governed by a statewide law. Interstate Highway, or Highway of the United States, would be set up in accordance with the law of the state, as outlined in the statute; however, this provision was not implemented until 1922. The state highway bill of Rights (1892\u20141948) is the first provision of the bill to be implemented in Pennsylvania in its current form and its implementation is yet to be known.\n\nSee also\n List of highways of the United States\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n PA 261 Online- Public Access (PA 251 web site)\n PA 263\n PA 261 from the Pennsylvania State Highway Act, National Highway History and History.

{"id":81,"ended":false,"length":366,"text":"The west wing, entered through the main cave, is in a semi @ - @ ruined state. It has a small chapel and a cistern enclosed within the pillared cave, which is the center of the town.. The south wing of the chapel is also close to the town. It is closed off from the main street of Waverley on the west, so that is only through the main street of Waverley.. I did not visit the southern tower. The east wing of the chapel is a much longer corridor, entering, from the south. There are no steps outside, but if you walk on the other side of the street, you will see how quickly the towers cross each other in front of the town. If you want to go back in time and get a more realistic look at the towers, then look for the old one in front of the town at a far off angle with the tower. I did check the angle out, but the direction is wrong, in the middle, and that is in the north. There is also a tunnel behind the church. That is the southern tower. It is also a really nice tunnel and is where you can take a picture of what you want to see. It also is where you can see the small hill in the middle. It is one of the best places I have looked, since I have never been there, and it is located in the eastern half of the town. Here is the tunnel to the north.. And there is a tunnel behind the church to the south. Then I decided to check out the north of the town. It is very far from the main street and the main road, but there are a few large shops nearby, since there are no shops open. The reason the town is so close, is because you will see this area at sunrise on day of sunrise!","token_len":372,"entropy":[9.3289,4.9864,3.0832,9.9824,4.1143,0.7022,3.8111,10.3914,2.0983,3.9696,4.1834,1.4208,6.7005,15.6221,6.1317,7.169,11.6516,4.8242,0.8831,3.0225,2.155,1.9328,3.5471,6.8945,2.1154,1.3978,8.8008,0.0084,9.7149,3.7951,1.9659,10.5607,3.8946,5.2536,2.8762,2.2208,1.1558,3.9244,4.8493,0.0749,0.2943,5.1499,7.4247,2.5124,3.7488,0.5175,3.0254,0.1897,4.5662,0.7145,3.9094,7.4712,0.1147,0.2877,3.8312,1.4851,2.4723,1.0122,5.4761,1.5911,2.5793,0.4733,2.6083,3.6164,3.7341,6.4193,3.7587,0.4232,5.0279,0.8158,2.3574,3.4284,3.2557,2.6832,3.7665,4.3303,5.1934,0.7261,2.035,1.5577,1.0354,0.7675,0.0064,0.0037,3.7173,4.501,4.1621,0.7688,4.4711,0.9268,5.0425,5.7458,2.6504,1.8933,4.3756,0.5918,1.1406,0.0806,0.5077,0.5079,3.2898,4.8661,4.9654,3.6233,1.6253,7.5224,6.4223,4.6828,0.8579,2.2827,2.5769,2.6779,1.0585,2.4058,5.8675,4.6386,2.6188,1.9305,4.3851,0.2874,1.8933,3.3885,0.9618,4.8502,0.0469,0.7606,0.2746,4.5124,1.1036,0.4987,0.8177,1.2318,6.726,5.696,1.2853,6.0344,6.3243,2.62,0.0157,3.7778,3.0132,0.0672,2.2238,2.6096,0.6828,4.0227,0.1592,3.8544,0.1418,1.9753,2.9097,2.4397,0.6769,2.7931,3.2749,2.1859,3.6928,4.3625,2.3312,0.5247,0.4442,2.5959,0.6182,2.954,4.161,2.159,0.6784,5.6687,5.0585,1.8822,3.0936,0.082,0.4701,1.2117,4.7658,3.6966,4.8538,4.2821,1.129,4.7098,0.3938,3.0389,1.659,3.0505,2.0084,6.2323,1.1998,5.8262,6.1696,1.8519,0.7764,2.6406,5.8723,2.1025,2.3949,2.0184,5.2477,1.4642,2.5688,2.7844,1.7201,3.8093,1.1502,5.5002,0.5875,3.2084,1.0745,3.3026,0.7928,2.2027,0.4393,5.498,4.1388,0.2314,3.4573,2.0484,4.7057,1.1197,2.1184,5.501,2.0913,1.3161,2.6165,0.6774,3.8638,2.4313,5.2524,2.3341,4.8876,3.8473,3.043,4.8469,1.3375,0.9761,4.0521,1.0655,2.7358,0.6264,4.0122,2.6937,2.9594,0.687,0.3223,0.6976,2.7522,3.5696,2.8216,2.6577,0.5048,0.259,1.8729,0.764,5.9127,5.4478,3.3532,0.9621,1.3843,2.0075,2.2375,0.4972,4.9502,0.1021,0.2719,3.2,1.8692,2.9397,0.6034,5.2305,2.4032,4.272,1.5051,2.034,2.0281,2.2872,1.8673,2.8954,1.423,1.4289,0.5621,4.998,1.2995,0.8674,5.844,3.4529,0.0189,0.4306,0.5385,0.5065,5.2636,0.785,1.2154,4.3954,3.4968,0.3633,1.7874,6.1562,5.3057,2.9482,0.4438,1.0365,3.4342,3.4544,0.2282,0.6361,2.5687,0.1142,0.7314,1.235,5.8666,3.6057,5.388,0.3062,3.676,2.1111,0.3807,4.2398,4.3699,0.3526,0.5111,1.1401,1.8297,0.4187,2.7908,4.4279,1.4285,0.2981,1.2644,0.4487,2.4148,2.5533,2.5043,2.0869,1.5643,1.7772,2.3111,1.0395,2.4279,0.692,5.2411,4.2255,3.8986,1.5785,6.3205,2.1419,0.781,2.6566,3.0199,5.7436,2.4926,1.8702,5.9115,3.848,3.0748,0.5072,1.1099,1.6594,4.3102,0.5252,0.4352,3.5607,2.8122,1.2137,4.182,4.3159,3.8888,4.5592,3.7229,4.2373,4.0268,3.7462,5.4706]}

The company returned to Hanau in February 2005, when the new V Corps commander announced he was retiring to take control of the V Corps at the V Corps' southern border.\nIt was in Hanau, the largest city on the Iraqi side, that the company was founded. It was named the 503st Engineer Company for the Persian Gulf War, and was one of the first private companies to go to Iraq for a tour during the war. The company was initially led by a corpsman called Tafqan as the commander of the 503rd Engineer Company, but later moved to a new location where he was appointed the 7th Engineer Company. The 503rd Engineer Company then moved its headquarters in Hanau back to Iraq after the U.S. troop buildup during the Iraq invasion.\nAccording to the Iraqi National War Information Center, 2,000 personnel were deployed in Iraq during both the 2003 and 2006 war campaigns, and in 2004 the 503rd Engineer Company was given a tour with the 7th Engineer Company, as part of the annual Iraq-Iraq War.\nThe 503st Engineer Company was the second private company to go to Iraq for a tour during the war, joining that of the V Corps in February 2004.

Then in 2007, the studio started up an all-new program called Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in which contestants were \"filling out a questionnaire\" for an annual $ 1.5 million prize. The program got off to a slow start and in 2008, the studio launched a spin at 20 episodes.\nNow, thanks to the help of some big financial partners, \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" will premiere later this year on ABC.\nThe network had to turn around because the studio needed to have its own spin to compete with \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" \u2014 \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" is now available on CBS, CBS Family and Turner.\n\"The networks felt we needed to have our own spin that was relevant and relevant to who we wanted everyone to be,\" said Amy Miley, president of syndicated programming for ABC.\n\"We wanted to run a spin to be relevant to who we wanted everyone to be, as opposed to what we were making in broadcast. And the network went along with that as well.\"\nIn addition to ABC, NBCUniversal and Comcast, the network has partnered with the \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" spin to produce \"Who Wants to Succeed,\" a five-episode series set against the backdrop of a new generation of millennials.\nSince that premiere, \"Who Wants to Succeed\" has been airing on eight ABC networks \u2014 ABC and CBS, NBC and ABC Family, NBC News, NBC News Network, CBS Local, and CNBC.","token_len":373,"entropy":[8.8503,0.1818,8.8114,4.4787,6.4186,0.2439,9.0629,9.017,3.1527,0.4358,4.4375,7.4205,14.5356,8.7929,4.738,9.3078,9.5486,6.7536,7.7419,2.214,0.0462,0.7173,0.4481,0.1784,5.9085,6.9189,0.0015,4.5547,3.5995,7.2435,5.0148,7.5333,2.4276,1.5069,9.8943,11.9685,5.3042,1.1004,3.8345,7.8691,0.5987,4.8525,2.0441,3.9222,0.6558,5.006,2.7917,5.1251,1.6248,4.1048,0.3377,0.6058,5.7169,1.7629,1.9813,0.2467,2.4296,6.095,4.3471,6.1692,3.8586,3.1153,0.4404,0.9126,2.9576,0.6985,3.4611,0.1789,0.0005,0.1013,0.4252,0.2205,2.1662,0.0009,2.0818,0.0246,0.7476,3.3273,5.3576,5.028,4.767,0.9144,2.4185,1.8709,1.8614,3.0995,3.1179,3.9907,2.6954,2.6063,1.8287,0.6004,0.1207,2.1948,0.9902,1.9128,2.4953,5.4554,1.9655,0.0397,0.1526,3.0714,0.0098,1.7778,3.8862,1.6596,0.5989,1.7491,2.7728,3.9588,1.0101,3.798,2.9065,6.934,1.5753,1.8389,1.5228,10.9379,0.9334,5.5746,0.0519,1.6319,3.9295,0.0336,4.2975,4.5753,6.1023,3.3715,0.5618,5.4184,1.0478,0.0882,0.0012,0.0283,0.123,0.0393,0.0574,0.0001,0.1746,2.8729,4.6161,4.8431,0.0298,0.3909,1.1089,2.8573,0.7883,1.0596,5.5727,4.3014,5.0759,3.6009,4.851,3.5735,4.9488,2.0028,5.5956,3.5928,1.2245,4.4157,3.0792,2.6031,2.1531,3.2594,3.2938,0.7841,2.3387,1.3025,0.0325,0.0015,0.0172,0.1656,0.0286,0.0196,0.0003,1.5689,3.7336,4.9484,1.281,0.152,0.0012,0.0527,0.6407,0.1443,0.2769,0.0014,0.9229,1.7541,2.8184,1.7909,0.6369,3.2278,1.746,3.1565,4.2498,1.4327,5.544,0.6141,0.6852,1.6614,2.6639,6.2209,6.0202,3.4546,1.843,0.6777,2.5952,2.5066,0.0187,0.4625,3.3253,1.8223,4.8823,2.4395,2.4117,0.4292,5.5734,0.491,2.2022,8.1033,0.1849,1.1944,1.2471,1.2355,5.1904,5.6918,5.8873,0.3133,2.3338,0.4259,4.6453,2.3176,1.2591,1.7921,1.7886,1.1144,1.3383,1.6539,1.1682,2.6433,0.4619,5.4094,1.3052,2.5308,3.8198,3.2499,1.6245,0.4706,1.4038,0.3494,0.6851,2.0966,0.0341,0.0432,1.8575,4.2822,0.8176,0.0043,4.0002,1.0759,1.8587,5.7164,2.9846,5.9366,2.0441,2.5647,3.2078,3.2732,5.0485,3.2261,0.3679,0.5949,4.6833,0.7145,1.4224,0.1107,3.3392,1.9618,0.2394,2.4551,0.6277,2.8935,1.7685,1.9402,4.7141,2.1372,1.6589,1.6165,1.7609,3.7538,0.0556,2.8111,3.7957,0.6763,0.049,0.0022,0.0135,0.0699,0.0145,0.0122,0.0002,0.138,0.9144,2.1359,3.1647,1.9001,2.6816,0.2521,0.0016,0.0561,8.025,0.0009,2.2847,1.2973,5.4273,0.0631,2.1674,1.1152,4.5287,4.4824,0.6839,0.8631,0.0015,1.6954,3.9662,3.3089,0.2705,5.6666,1.1236,0.6992,5.5877,4.3825,4.05,0.4194,1.0298,0.0842,0.0072,0.0017,0.0073,0.8662,0.0,0.0453,0.239,1.6625,4.008,0.6988,6.4725,3.143,3.0402,2.9165,1.3655,5.2268,0.9537,0.4587,2.0393,2.2239,2.3437,0.1262,0.9089,3.118,4.2415,0.5786,2.1553,2.9533,3.3806,0.5616,2.1589,6.129,0.7107,2.4245,5.1961,0.459]}
{"id":4868,"ended":true,"length":359,"text":"Despite its innovations, Mario Bros. was not a major success in North America due to the video game crash in 1983. It did however receive a number of home versions on the Apple TV and iPhone, as well as a range of television games, a variety of home movie, and a large list of other online video games.\nMario Bros. was a success, but it only received positive reviews from critics \u2013 including on GameSpot. One critic wrote that the video game's sequel \"feels a little much like Breath of the Wild\", and that \"even if it's a sequel to Breath and Wild, Mario Bros.' 3D content looks... uh... bland\".\nAs for the fact that Mario had never held a big market share, the video game and the video game world have grown to form one of the largest media markets today.\nOne of the reasons why this trend has been continuing is a \"stuck period\", due to more demand for games in many regions due to the lack of available games in North America. In turn, the increasing popularity of Nintendo's consoles has also given rise to more \"localized\" video games. As part of this trend, Nintendo of America, a division of Nintendo Entertainment Systems, and publishers of the Mario games have been able to increase the number of local Nintendo consoles available, particularly for handheld and console release.\nIn addition to this, it has been known that the popular series has experienced rapid growth over the years in its reach. In fact, Mario Bros. was the first title on Nintendo's disc box for many of the NES, SNES, Nintendo C-2U and XBOX series, both of which were developed by Nintendo. With the rise of these games, the Nintendo console market is growing even further, and Nintendo is planning to release a game in Japan for the first time this year.","token_len":373,"entropy":[5.6038,9.6166,0.5615,9.1678,4.101,0.2333,3.7167,3.4161,2.0535,5.1625,2.0211,2.6557,4.1704,0.0293,5.1272,0.064,1.7135,7.6124,0.2055,9.6301,3.6116,4.1577,0.6088,2.6441,3.8564,3.0913,5.3937,1.141,2.9052,0.0037,7.3224,6.7853,3.6787,1.2949,6.204,3.523,1.4884,5.6432,1.1857,2.8125,0.044,0.0145,1.1895,6.603,0.0501,5.5018,2.9912,1.8465,4.6713,3.7772,0.0131,4.2913,5.8398,3.5618,0.4427,1.2564,4.505,5.8342,0.0053,2.3755,5.7809,2.2909,0.8163,0.3642,1.1676,16.1632,0.8917,0.1048,2.1864,2.5989,3.6764,2.8191,2.0116,1.6802,4.8883,3.3646,5.0688,0.1406,1.2242,1.1852,7.1415,4.0577,6.0581,2.5628,0.8624,1.0517,4.5986,1.4968,2.9715,1.3587,1.3205,4.2793,0.1797,2.5247,5.9324,1.8597,5.8995,0.0253,3.0133,0.7913,6.394,0.4604,9.0129,0.0126,0.0263,0.0007,2.9127,1.844,1.3191,1.9813,4.8911,1.8187,1.6267,1.3461,1.6916,4.0177,1.3687,2.6005,7.1057,7.8722,0.7345,2.2385,0.6385,3.066,7.052,1.4323,6.4366,3.893,6.7107,8.1318,1.1262,5.0381,1.9314,1.5356,5.5696,1.8215,1.1253,5.5592,0.0662,1.8765,4.542,2.8226,6.1232,0.7894,5.1092,6.0033,0.1999,1.7926,2.2982,3.1761,0.0848,5.7594,2.8391,2.3819,0.1727,4.5921,3.3659,4.8724,3.9543,7.2639,2.0794,2.2669,0.0636,1.885,3.3685,2.4931,3.9097,0.4678,1.8538,4.7847,0.8254,0.1751,3.3922,2.1183,3.2854,5.338,1.6045,1.7203,6.3255,0.5867,5.1243,6.0906,6.1634,3.6112,10.0019,2.7321,4.6244,0.2797,6.3692,5.8099,0.4143,2.5657,2.4984,5.4796,2.18,3.4923,0.0155,0.9869,3.7732,0.0137,5.4163,2.2199,1.8896,2.8238,0.0176,0.4675,2.8438,5.6981,0.2037,2.0925,5.9118,1.6453,0.0639,2.6178,0.584,3.7825,1.5637,2.5127,4.05,1.8617,0.0142,2.5203,4.0493,6.6862,2.7454,0.2046,3.1616,0.3517,1.5738,3.5935,5.1215,0.0014,0.6157,1.1991,0.1002,2.177,4.2493,0.0563,3.5833,3.403,2.4286,0.1087,1.2992,4.4499,4.4284,0.5081,4.1324,4.9968,4.5165,1.7993,3.0617,1.9346,1.767,1.9107,3.5904,0.0164,3.6611,1.1067,1.1021,0.0335,1.3752,5.5653,5.0042,3.9243,2.9107,4.6414,2.5949,4.8959,2.5418,3.3621,5.4423,0.5558,0.6143,2.4155,1.8446,0.9057,2.139,0.4733,4.1188,1.0107,2.3394,5.3213,0.8527,1.8701,5.6127,4.2655,3.5106,5.0118,4.8616,0.3506,2.8052,0.1783,1.0623,3.7423,4.9571,6.3889,1.2427,2.1945,1.8707,0.0538,3.6738,0.9987,0.1006,1.6885,1.9189,0.8166,3.2772,3.6542,1.6039,0.1684,6.8921,8.8256,3.3494,3.9628,5.2266,0.6488,5.1267,3.3566,2.4621,0.0032,0.1811,4.2082,8.6724,2.9626,4.0242,7.3783,2.0826,5.0223,3.2276,5.5626,1.6826,5.2544,0.6214,0.0056,0.8725,3.1163,0.6585,0.6684,1.0591,5.1558,1.1728,3.7228,0.1343,4.3301,2.1333,0.4181,1.5827,3.1792,4.0323,2.3234,2.5637,3.01,3.8636,2.1796,1.1611,1.1992,2.8776,1.7603,4.5256,0.4175,1.8963,1.6222,4.0575,2.648,3.5083,2.7811,0.4607,2.8479,0.0307,2.2858,0.3618,0.3101]}

{"id":2013,"ended":true,"length":352,"text":"The easternmost forming Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, Tropical Storm Christine, originated as a tropical wave over Africa in mid @ - @ August. As it neared the Atlantic Ocean, the powerful super cyclone reached the US coast as it churned a dark blue ocean. The storm, which is centered about 70 miles (120 kilometers) off of Cape Horn, has the largest cloud cover since the Atlantic hurricane year (2013-18), reaching nearly 4 feet (2 meters) above sea level. Christine, along with one other tropical cyclone, named John, became a category 1 hurricane today, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. In early October, Christine strengthened to a category 1 hurricane before it had even formed. A hurricane warning had been in effect because the storm was moving as though to form to enter the United States. A tropical storm watch was in effect until at least Oct. 15. The NHC forecasts Christine to have a maximum sustained winds of 120 miles (160 kilometers) and a slow, fast growth rate of 15 mph. Christine, which is about 180 miles (250 kph), is forecast to move with a strengthening period of 21 days or so. Christine\u2019s hurricane and tropical storm warnings were in effect for much of the day as it headed to the western Pacific where it is estimated up to 90 percent of the surface is covered with tropical haze. Tropical Storm Christine will keep going through the eastern Atlantic until the peak of its strength. Christine is forecast to move up to 40 miles (60 kilometers) offshore on Friday before being moved into the western Pacific late Sunday. Christine will move to the lower Midwest and North and Central America Sunday and into a tropical depression by next week. The storm will move west-northwestward along a coast east of the U.S. late Monday through Tuesday, forecasters said.","token_len":373,"entropy":[10.0419,3.7139,12.6247,9.3142,8.102,1.34,0.0737,5.1958,0.558,1.4395,7.1224,0.2828,8.7555,2.3961,8.1673,4.328,0.3369,1.5964,6.275,4.5974,6.2565,2.5496,3.6055,14.7685,7.5414,4.8833,6.055,3.5637,5.3513,2.2726,4.7907,0.0004,0.9697,2.6129,2.1103,0.5538,1.6449,4.587,6.6046,4.5029,0.083,5.2302,1.1961,5.9924,1.4324,5.2375,1.5101,5.1563,0.0181,6.291,6.8286,2.3342,3.4368,2.065,1.7818,1.505,3.461,0.7934,2.2516,4.2759,3.9211,4.1307,0.3127,2.4026,2.9092,0.508,0.0147,2.9948,3.5586,1.9121,3.9621,0.2059,3.3371,4.2363,3.0201,6.4594,0.2231,5.3733,1.9173,4.7272,1.373,6.0873,5.0471,4.9152,2.3026,4.4857,1.5759,3.8684,3.5943,3.1196,2.3405,0.374,1.5382,0.4448,0.1597,3.7725,0.5159,0.0196,0.4417,5.0703,2.8713,3.1904,0.0168,5.5293,2.119,2.2039,0.7582,0.0114,0.9164,5.4337,6.8503,2.058,5.4758,1.6321,4.401,1.9863,0.5495,7.64,1.545,3.2253,0.0035,0.7156,2.5095,0.0015,0.0299,0.0063,0.3955,0.0556,0.0061,0.2732,3.9578,4.5987,2.9573,0.2883,3.479,5.301,1.3685,0.7492,2.3219,2.6551,0.6,4.2598,2.6691,4.6013,3.529,4.1799,0.6788,4.147,4.2407,4.7086,5.0543,0.4373,3.5704,0.3468,7.4075,2.0956,0.9133,1.0757,2.5135,4.7054,4.9142,5.0073,4.5194,5.8805,6.2487,0.5023,3.1762,0.0095,1.0549,3.6777,2.7443,0.903,1.4935,1.7665,0.847,0.337,2.4975,4.2932,0.0046,5.4507,0.1034,3.0222,1.0003,1.7456,6.1084,0.0051,5.5021,4.0976,0.7547,3.6675,0.9756,1.3452,0.8589,0.8583,0.0812,3.4882,1.6995,1.0048,2.7333,0.0866,0.1462,3.6554,0.857,7.2311,3.5101,4.8122,6.9065,1.8098,0.8101,3.7577,1.0215,1.1608,4.6426,3.5249,1.2413,1.2538,3.3824,5.353,0.0825,0.1593,2.7377,7.7443,2.1037,1.1345,1.0593,3.3453,0.0952,2.836,4.3174,1.7891,7.2369,6.5076,0.341,6.5019,0.4559,3.2784,2.2213,0.668,4.6626,15.6817,9.1852,4.2217,4.8735,5.4504,1.9998,0.7434,4.0596,1.8863,1.8462,0.1087,1.6704,4.7676,0.02,1.0491,1.2319,3.5039,1.0974,3.8961,2.9861,0.3831,3.8078,2.0184,5.5563,0.4104,2.9872,5.1414,7.8772,0.0098,3.2852,1.0028,0.1369,0.5315,6.0135,2.7914,1.4499,1.608,2.1057,6.9143,0.3749,3.5183,0.9183,3.1698,3.7484,6.4116,6.1584,3.398,0.9314,5.7278,2.6189,2.2157,2.6567,7.1581,0.3592,1.0271,3.427,2.3781,5.2191,1.273,2.7355,0.0531,2.1646,3.4529,0.69,3.4742,0.2802,0.1517,0.8182,0.3118,0.0604,4.0744,3.3793,1.9694,4.3288,4.6953,3.0622,2.8709,0.5534,2.4844,0.3224,5.7812,2.7177,1.3778,4.4688,1.9203,2.6505,2.7218,0.5314,5.5311,5.1676,2.2607,3.7338,3.1695,2.6488,2.049,6.0632,2.3307,2.1085,5.624,1.9523,2.7708,4.1241,5.6818,1.3342,0.4859,1.4997,1.2669,1.3729,2.2195,2.8517,3.5091,0.3859,0.0796,3.3945,3.4494,3.4477,4.9251,5.2617,0.257,1.4367,3.7341,0.0012,0.0038,0.3375,6.3833,2.1335,1.428,1.1686,1.6774,7.1305,0.0272,0.5004,0.1714]}
{"id":699,"ended":false,"length":321,"text":"Unlike almost all other dinosaur groups, skulls are the most commonly preserved elements of ceratopsian skeletons and many species are known only from skulls. There is a great deal of variation between and different types of skulls in the skeletons of Ceratopsian dinosaurs (primarily in the case of the large black, red, or a bright tan skull). Different specimens of skeletons from different Ceratopsian families (including the famous black, red, or a bright tan skull) have often been found in different parts of the world. A number of these are located in Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. The best indication of whether one type of skull is valuable for research is in the quality of the skulls of Ceratopsian fossils from the other continents.\nThe discovery and study of bones from a set of specimens from four different Ceratopsian fossils has become a leading source of information for the international paleontological community. It is now available that more than 90 percent of the specimens have been obtained and that more than 40 percent have been preserved. However, the information from these specimens is limited by physical constraints and is difficult to obtain with the exception of small bone fragments or hard stone fragments of the specimens themselves and specimens that have already been identified. All the data collected have been extremely limited and the information presented here is only the basis for finding further fossils as well as more useful fossils. Therefore, it is extremely important that the scientific community use the methods contained herein to help understand more about the morphology, bone shape and composition of the skeleton of Ceratopsian dinosaurs, which includes the use of paleontological tools to understand the morphology and composition of the skeleton of Ceratopsian dinosaurs.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\nhttp:\/\/www.cis.org\/research\/publications\/research-statistics-and-statistics\/","token_len":373,"entropy":[7.6788,1.6975,3.2666,9.7787,4.5864,0.4806,9.3012,1.3886,3.3689,1.4599,3.704,3.6963,6.1624,2.1585,7.1482,1.4103,0.0433,0.1652,4.468,3.3574,5.4445,3.4955,2.2295,3.2598,4.4341,0.5472,3.9454,1.6961,4.6797,1.5818,1.8517,2.9701,0.2565,0.2342,1.3974,2.2444,6.5748,7.6106,1.8768,0.0548,1.1872,2.6381,1.6026,7.1376,0.3927,5.5277,0.012,0.0079,0.5405,0.8049,2.997,6.3259,0.2079,3.4849,0.8828,4.8406,0.0268,1.2365,4.3944,5.9983,3.9583,3.7969,0.8084,3.5059,7.1661,6.1901,6.1655,1.608,1.2723,5.7576,4.1016,0.9753,6.9928,2.1502,0.7914,5.1395,0.0013,0.0045,0.0633,3.7205,2.9154,2.9572,1.4074,6.2215,4.7473,1.6658,0.4288,0.1255,1.0628,0.3312,0.451,0.194,1.056,0.3228,2.0624,5.8993,0.4597,0.7459,1.0234,1.8132,2.6109,0.018,0.2035,0.3355,0.8821,4.0987,3.5685,0.0121,3.3954,3.387,5.8821,0.2897,4.3833,0.5408,3.3697,0.0432,1.4891,2.9979,0.0893,0.6201,2.2895,4.7319,7.2225,0.2988,3.7535,3.7431,3.3423,0.1667,0.2851,0.782,7.5326,2.7168,3.1694,0.5538,4.132,0.4982,5.2865,0.1356,0.4871,3.6723,2.5191,4.276,0.0028,0.0052,0.2144,3.8729,4.3246,1.7448,5.9918,4.1427,0.5544,1.5612,7.9982,6.7603,4.501,3.3876,0.0172,4.6346,1.32,3.1719,5.9603,0.0548,4.6467,1.4048,5.532,1.189,1.6526,0.0012,0.0065,0.0173,6.0811,2.538,4.7834,1.1398,5.1157,3.0113,0.0865,1.114,1.9381,2.0523,5.8347,2.0083,0.0754,0.6785,0.1263,0.4494,3.1696,0.8837,2.6532,4.9289,5.7348,4.4806,0.338,3.7559,1.6496,0.0277,0.7764,3.0133,3.2444,0.2204,4.3683,2.4831,3.7798,2.9692,0.1739,3.3011,0.3392,1.4944,0.2185,2.866,0.9744,4.3409,0.0547,1.6971,4.9361,3.5486,1.3926,0.9438,1.3828,2.6463,2.0284,7.9273,2.1592,1.5275,2.8651,3.9024,0.0574,0.9312,3.7695,2.0822,4.5845,0.0101,4.2506,4.1473,0.5262,3.7807,5.9074,5.2638,1.0831,3.2672,2.0593,5.2519,5.4933,4.8341,4.3332,2.3599,1.0923,4.8792,0.0853,3.6489,0.6752,5.3572,2.1753,4.4164,2.7141,3.4815,0.6526,6.6653,1.619,1.1867,2.3643,2.9616,4.0104,1.1394,0.8192,2.5309,2.6369,2.5173,0.4586,6.0688,5.1506,3.2255,5.8323,1.3262,0.1516,4.6434,5.1784,3.6364,0.6774,4.4085,0.1781,1.8089,0.1499,5.3225,0.1054,1.069,1.391,2.7098,0.1365,4.6095,1.2827,6.1406,6.7194,2.1467,0.3839,3.5863,3.6235,3.7215,0.7387,0.7438,5.5619,1.4476,5.9561,5.8938,2.278,3.3705,0.031,1.2369,5.2327,1.0271,1.3825,0.0007,0.0042,0.0318,0.2116,2.5928,3.1177,3.567,1.2729,4.9725,0.0073,4.4211,0.224,0.4277,1.6624,2.4233,3.3129,0.8178,4.4358,0.9989,1.9269,0.0277,1.0326,2.6944,0.5709,2.2753,0.0006,0.0036,0.011,0.2237,0.475,0.6853,3.8329,4.3498,0.6641,0.0007,9.1185,0.7271,19.0406,0.0004,0.6301,0.0011,3.6316,4.2736,0.8255,2.0848,0.2778,4.3721,0.1346,6.4081,0.176,0.0681,5.4212,1.463,6.0072,0.4016,1.2782,2.3555,0.0243,3.7061,0.5099,0.8041]}

But there are also many cultural experiences ( such as the American National Touring Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, the American Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian and the National Cathedral ) and all of them are really good places to shop for all kinds of things.\n\nSo which of these cities is best for the shopping experience?\n\n2. San Francisco\nSan Francisco is considered as one of the best for outdoor wear in the US and its environs. It gets really warm while you are out in nature, so you can enjoy the heat or go on a hike and see the city in its best. It also gets a very nice summer.\nSan Francisco also has an incredible variety of eateries with nice outdoor seating where you can eat and enjoy the weather for longer. I especially love the Italian Cuisine and Mexican, Mexican, Mexican food restaurants here.\n\nIf you want to explore some of the cities in town in February or early March, make sure to visit these sites before it\u2019s too late.

The initial proposal was for a Lunar orbiter that would launch the Moon-Satellite. Once onboard the Moon-Satellite, Mercury would complete two moon-to-moon cycle of orbits around Saturn in 2021 and 2022.\n\nAfter the Saturn cycle, Mercury did return to Earth in September 2021, when the moon was not visible on the moon. Later in May, Gemini astronauts were placed in orbit again with NASA astronaut Mark Tipton, who is originally from the United States of America.\n\nIn October 2017, NASA astronaut Mark Tipton said that the Apollo 11 mission was too good to pass up on because the two spacecraft had only been to lunar orbit. Tipton said that he has never felt more at home on an orbiter before. He added that he feels \"relaxed\" knowing that it was an Apollo 11 mission and that he will do so again.\n\nNASA astronauts Mark Tipton and Mark Tipton on an asteroid that was cleared with a lunar orbiter on July 28, 1969. The lunar orbiter and moonslide vehicle were originally conceived in the mid-1970s, but were modified in the late 1990s, allowing for a lunar orbiter in 2007. During his trip to the asteroid, Tipton was allowed to view the lunar eclipse, which lasted one day. He and Tipton said they thought about sending a capsule down into the asteroid for monitoring of the moon, but opted for the Gemini spacecraft because Gemini was much longer and the solar system had a larger diameter.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\nNASA: NASA moon lunar orbiter\nNASA Mars Exploration Rover Program at Gemini\nNASA Mars Exploration Rover Program at NASA","token_len":373,"entropy":[2.2525,10.6302,4.7731,3.7678,2.8444,7.0998,8.7893,2.8803,5.5919,4.2826,3.7158,5.8089,0.0428,2.7352,8.4106,5.489,11.7941,1.6072,6.4577,5.3995,5.3258,0.27,0.8261,2.0687,3.536,1.5981,1.8652,4.9502,3.4889,1.1879,2.1311,0.9621,4.6506,4.4584,0.1062,2.6452,0.5328,3.7216,2.9365,4.4454,4.016,3.7354,5.1169,3.4168,6.2347,6.671,1.1428,2.2244,0.6776,0.0632,0.0129,0.7741,5.0697,0.6933,5.8631,4.7178,6.7176,1.7795,4.6835,0.0249,1.7191,7.0903,4.0082,4.4902,3.456,4.3514,3.8109,7.3993,1.0064,1.0506,0.5468,1.7691,0.0058,3.9448,1.42,4.3383,5.5823,1.1402,1.331,6.748,5.5606,0.2961,0.5172,2.0611,5.9992,3.1749,1.9182,4.4769,1.3775,3.4075,2.2725,5.2272,3.4139,2.8964,1.2656,3.5705,0.8672,5.4174,1.9106,6.1266,1.1417,4.9238,4.6658,2.8122,4.71,1.7833,1.6909,6.8539,3.652,4.9783,5.2322,4.9301,6.4943,6.1279,0.0612,2.42,1.142,4.6347,6.402,0.1656,2.1568,1.8409,0.1606,4.3246,0.0042,0.3836,1.0691,0.0002,2.8017,3.4007,3.35,0.1643,1.6706,2.8956,3.5124,3.8893,0.0214,0.0015,5.0559,1.2423,1.3969,3.0087,2.2763,1.3482,1.6939,5.6433,5.6233,0.2985,0.9068,1.1725,3.5584,5.494,2.0688,5.9461,1.8727,2.0647,4.7157,1.5685,5.2508,5.2229,0.296,1.9531,2.9689,0.0027,0.0012,1.4244,0.75,2.3108,4.3673,2.8899,4.4262,2.5064,3.7751,0.5955,1.3743,4.0153,4.0116,0.3457,4.2445,0.6816,2.8979,2.3056,0.288,1.0992,3.9254,2.7852,4.8893,1.8156,0.0045,0.6743,4.9566,0.3156,4.021,1.7401,3.7347,1.3204,1.0632,0.2435,2.0003,0.8219,0.8753,2.2426,4.5561,3.9342,0.2709,1.366,0.3121,0.0002,2.941,3.9123,3.851,0.1564,0.0044,0.0024,0.7865,2.3848,1.9593,0.401,0.005,3.7086,3.9803,5.3855,3.5925,2.236,7.3809,5.5028,2.1388,4.4414,1.5585,0.0551,2.5738,2.9007,3.7515,0.0809,3.5804,0.5682,2.7754,4.4128,0.9583,0.011,4.5628,8.2567,7.1083,0.6004,5.0948,1.2924,4.3181,4.3158,3.2121,2.0693,3.5781,0.4335,1.0231,0.1062,2.6401,1.0107,1.8699,5.0814,1.535,1.051,1.7215,1.5051,0.0052,3.0278,5.277,1.4794,1.6796,2.4027,1.6016,0.0666,2.9169,6.7815,0.2914,6.4573,3.2733,4.3144,0.6071,0.8978,2.4977,0.8625,0.6214,0.0041,0.0034,2.7877,5.9816,0.1796,4.1227,0.917,2.5588,5.376,2.3131,1.1128,3.8436,5.0675,2.5289,1.0228,3.3343,5.0901,1.4413,0.009,0.0033,4.0879,1.6889,4.4441,2.9116,4.3308,1.2432,5.4332,5.3834,2.8815,0.4469,0.7634,3.8429,7.0997,5.1657,0.8039,1.7391,2.3662,0.3876,5.6141,1.2206,1.5329,3.2892,2.549,2.14,4.6357,1.7628,5.5235,4.9854,1.4753,3.2104,5.429,1.1095,3.0007,1.953,3.0486,1.8758,0.4151,0.7068,0.0002,8.2428,1.2267,0.0003,6.2974,1.0078,0.0003,5.3628,0.9197,0.6325,25.0878,3.4341,3.3078,7.1177,6.5101,1.1096,0.1005,2.7218,22.8937,4.0904,2.8497,1.5524,3.3416,6.3455,6.4194,1.8806,20.3935,2.4605,0.9117,0.2681,0.2933,0.3799,2.2134]}

{"id":4693,"ended":false,"length":306,"text":"Unhappy with how his NHL career ended, Fleury hired a personal trainer in February 2009 and began an attempt to return to the NHL. By August, he petitioned Commissioner Gary Bettman to force the retirement of his 30-year-old defenseman after a season that ended in the 2011 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. However, Bettman was not in a position to mandate retirement from an NHL career.\n\nIn early March 2010, Fleury called the time up and told his father, Dan, that he would be retiring from hockey at the end of the season. At the time, Fleury believed and called Bettman, \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I only want to keep playing and keep working. If the season ends, I\u2019ll get a call from GM. I\u2019ll have an extra call from GM. I\u2019ll leave off practice. If GM asks a question about a contract, they\u2019re happy to answer it.

{"id":2113,"ended":false,"length":347,"text":"Ron Gilbert conceived the idea of a pirate adventure game in 1988, after completing Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders. He first wrote story ideas about pirates while spending the weekend at a nearby hotel, and when the next summer he created a pirate survival horror game called \"The Curse Of A Pirate.\" It was released in a two week release on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through Activision.\n\nIn 1991, Ron Gilbert created the idea of the concept for Pirates of the Caribbean. While running around, he would see people around the world and make jokes about how the pirates were all good because they all play Pirates. He had one idea: making pirates pirate fun.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean had never been done before. Gilbert had the idea for it in a journal titled \"On Pirates\" to help people identify what pirates were making at the time. That journal was later turned into a book called \"Pirate the Movie.\"\n\nGilbert worked in publishing for the first half and had to cut most or all of the artwork. The last few years he worked with a full time professional writer to create Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse Of A Pirate. A series of books, some about pirates, some about pirates and pirates\u2019 identities, have been published.\n\nIn October 2016, Gilbert completed a Kickstarter for \"Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse of A Pirate,\" which is currently supported by around 25,000 backers. He says that he is extremely excited about this project and believes that \u201cthis book will be the game for many of the pirate fans out there.\u201d\n\n\"Pirate the Movie\" (from \"Pirate the Movie\") by Ron Gilbert\n\n\"The Curse Of A Pirate\" is expected to release in the United States in late October.\n\nPirate the Movie","token_len":374,"entropy":[10.488,12.3329,1.3127,1.1702,0.5733,1.7414,8.2313,6.3184,1.9644,1.9452,4.8608,1.2383,3.9273,5.8214,13.6516,8.1764,4.4006,0.0889,3.9785,3.778,6.6421,7.0193,6.4584,0.4683,1.6879,2.6428,5.4797,4.0304,8.0917,3.2973,3.7297,3.699,4.9987,7.0261,3.005,6.4801,1.1441,1.9784,4.3812,3.4186,1.3727,1.3086,4.2428,2.2734,4.9877,4.355,1.1268,4.6647,1.147,2.1472,6.3672,3.9505,0.3891,1.3247,3.3078,2.0275,5.3368,3.9778,3.9949,2.1295,1.0164,3.5486,1.0978,2.8957,0.5804,5.7754,5.504,5.0754,4.5278,3.1425,3.3716,1.8257,1.302,0.9935,0.0505,0.4367,0.4045,0.1061,6.0482,6.768,1.7251,0.8921,0.0005,2.7154,3.0952,0.5894,8.0224,0.0294,3.4617,1.3056,3.7384,0.2384,3.2936,6.7456,1.9575,4.8846,0.4754,0.0941,0.0043,2.4462,4.4799,6.0041,1.8434,4.2963,0.7923,3.344,4.1211,3.5415,6.2451,1.4373,1.5746,3.37,4.1079,3.753,0.531,2.4188,2.4764,1.4072,0.9498,4.3419,4.928,5.5748,0.5539,4.3498,5.383,4.6508,0.9126,1.416,3.8823,4.8026,2.6322,2.167,5.952,2.3308,5.1745,5.9596,0.7746,1.1971,0.0002,3.6985,0.1278,0.4406,0.0484,0.001,4.1984,4.3393,0.5898,3.5787,0.0919,1.325,4.9645,2.2083,4.2672,0.568,1.7492,1.8675,2.0563,2.9571,7.3359,5.5504,0.5678,5.8614,2.7099,3.0269,5.2469,2.8547,2.0062,6.2825,2.6392,2.2238,0.6444,6.4001,5.8157,0.7775,0.1165,0.3339,4.5622,1.7571,1.1055,3.3937,3.8105,0.0457,0.7635,2.6901,1.1306,0.5963,0.4037,2.6228,5.916,5.1736,1.2089,0.9556,0.0002,3.5596,0.0046,4.5358,3.9572,5.1302,1.2769,3.2282,3.9182,2.8153,7.4688,4.9395,2.7957,3.9185,6.0726,6.554,0.0168,0.0702,1.0376,5.9306,2.1935,2.5062,4.6293,2.5429,0.8981,2.4206,2.3597,3.0509,2.8444,6.562,1.2903,6.5439,3.137,1.861,2.0554,3.7456,0.5362,0.0459,0.0041,1.3691,1.8571,0.1127,1.4662,0.4082,0.0028,0.4328,4.8944,5.1727,0.1563,3.6037,2.7525,4.7183,5.1827,0.8403,0.754,3.0333,0.3927,0.7572,2.4277,2.0464,15.2198,8.1117,12.5,1.0161,4.4066,0.4454,0.6996,1.7794,0.9343,0.0003,2.5292,5.7633,4.0102,0.1886,1.256,4.5899,1.873,2.8979,1.8138,2.955,0.3179,0.9912,3.0895,0.275,0.025,0.3017,0.6194,0.1859,1.8691,1.2019,0.0025,1.8044,1.1195,2.8142,2.5111,6.1485,0.2866,6.677,5.3525,0.7668,0.0175,1.1105,0.2373,2.311,3.647,1.3963,1.493,2.3185,4.9288,0.8913,0.6318,2.2595,0.6204,0.8677,4.9083,0.7263,14.6791,7.2817,3.7329,3.397,0.7751,1.9061,1.3425,4.5587,2.4867,3.2237,2.711,1.7928,3.3649,2.6342,3.5274,0.0206,1.2071,6.9121,7.4727,0.4353,0.0002,3.2161,1.7462,2.601,0.5546,0.4737,0.4341,5.3259,5.1613,2.0715,0.1363,1.2519,0.5211,0.3175,0.7007,3.7458,0.9419,0.0009,1.5122,0.0002,2.7561,3.0514,0.6968,0.9928,0.0583,0.0014,0.131,1.235,6.0365,0.096,2.362,1.1799,2.4906,3.0819,0.0288,2.1694,3.2649,4.1852,1.4446,1.3801,0.0002,4.7481,1.2965,0.6902,0.3403]}

Sarah was a doctor who also worked as a pharmacist. Eric, on the other hand, was a pharmacist who worked with the same family since 1969.\nSarah did teach her children some of the medicine. For example, we often see the pediatricians giving free prescriptions to young parents and the parents are helping make sure our child is taken care of if they are not taken care of.\nAfter they finished their studies, Dylan and her kids decided to travel up north to Mexico.\n\nSara had two daughters together and was a great mother as well. She was active in the San Juan Community Church, worked as a volunteer in El Paso, and was an advocate for the homeless.\n\nSarah also worked as a missionary. She is currently the mother of three and has been active both as a church and community advocate.\nIn addition, Sarah has been known to ask us for a prayer for all who are homeless or homeless.\n\nThe second child and third child in the family, Eric\u2019s, have been very happy and loving.

{"id":4208,"ended":true,"length":343,"text":"The Picardy Spaniel is a docile breed of dog and is fond of playing with children and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a playful temperament, and loving the new breed of owners.\n\nTrying to identify the sweetest canine of the year, this is a breed that was probably first bred by British explorer Alfred Aylward in 1866. The famous explorer had an interest in the breed so he set about picking the finest breed from the country, and in 1900 selected the Picardy Spaniel.\n\nThe breed has received a great deal of criticism and was later adopted as a collage dog by two prominent breed groups. However the French and British breeders were very unhappy with the breed and chose it as a breeding dog as its native home to help people identify its breed. The breed was eventually adopted as a collage dog by French scientists while British breeders were upset when it was used as a lab terrier.\n\nIt is known in most areas as both a French and British breed due to its wide variety of colors and its unique markings that make it a unique breed. The Picardy has had some difficulty of being adopted back and forth but in the end it was adopted by four British breeders and is still a breed of dog.\n\nTreatment for Picardy Spaniel\n\nIn addition to veterinary care, the breed is home to a wealth of food and pet food, which is very helpful when people need care to treat their dog poorly. In order to use the breed for its best treatment, most people prefer it as a dog. However, most people might not even get into a dog when the vet says it is too fragile. Most people start by taking the breed to the vet and then you will surely find out what you need for your dog.","token_len":374,"entropy":[12.7069,4.1846,9.4047,5.7788,2.1417,1.4701,9.6568,0.2824,3.9332,2.016,1.3742,3.5552,2.4055,6.7979,0.0318,3.2324,0.8875,5.0007,1.9891,11.7323,4.1997,0.2379,2.0836,6.2367,0.2409,1.7487,0.8411,5.6241,0.2225,2.3189,1.04,3.9717,10.4138,0.9314,2.117,1.4985,6.217,1.1332,3.7042,1.8176,1.0615,0.4789,5.2162,3.1621,6.754,4.3759,1.343,6.7332,0.4021,1.1421,0.0027,4.8541,5.2823,0.2985,5.1471,1.1199,8.3142,1.3384,5.1738,4.101,1.3112,4.5127,0.9948,3.1097,3.3448,1.6776,4.6371,0.9504,3.7714,5.6481,3.3641,1.4634,2.3091,4.8283,4.5881,5.8205,5.5163,5.9256,1.0702,1.2349,1.2074,4.8799,0.4618,1.8764,6.6002,3.3441,3.8522,4.2871,2.8242,0.0195,1.6041,2.6474,5.7022,0.6669,4.2849,1.5683,6.5446,2.4713,3.9395,3.4191,3.8087,1.2465,5.6879,2.1512,2.0345,3.2711,5.5191,4.7312,1.3432,6.1127,0.0162,0.4144,0.0008,0.9667,1.3947,0.0002,1.3687,2.9072,1.8442,5.1354,1.5924,2.5731,0.1246,0.0235,4.2029,2.7535,4.409,5.7194,3.668,2.3688,0.618,5.638,5.3751,1.4218,1.0262,5.9188,4.6599,1.7872,3.7579,1.9467,4.458,3.4187,4.8533,3.2664,2.5664,2.7816,0.5521,2.7268,3.0032,6.1323,0.291,0.303,2.6269,0.9815,3.8504,4.4106,0.732,1.3749,4.2031,2.8314,4.3952,3.8558,7.0417,3.6463,6.2992,5.4605,6.1574,4.2862,1.9152,2.8319,0.5805,1.8872,2.7254,1.3757,2.9941,1.0791,1.5839,0.2572,1.1798,0.0239,0.3815,0.68,5.0658,5.799,6.4068,3.3812,3.1277,0.0183,1.8453,4.8801,4.2753,2.0353,0.5391,4.248,0.7545,0.3181,4.9423,9.2823,0.0003,0.7987,0.6066,0.0002,4.2451,0.6139,3.434,3.5509,5.102,3.3762,2.0298,6.3665,0.4268,5.5422,0.7681,0.9344,1.5872,5.1291,0.0715,0.4799,5.2656,1.8683,0.2276,2.3103,0.8987,2.4724,3.6366,4.1126,4.1429,2.0468,0.1665,1.7787,3.5445,0.772,0.7569,1.5894,1.9795,0.005,4.958,4.2869,3.1985,5.0657,6.3364,2.8368,2.0395,6.7006,4.5794,1.013,4.3937,3.5529,1.2993,2.8016,1.3211,1.0825,1.283,1.2651,5.6909,3.2942,0.5321,0.0405,1.7053,2.7283,2.5576,3.2169,4.2309,2.3187,3.7342,0.8256,0.655,0.0002,3.2003,4.3888,3.3251,3.2866,0.0043,0.3224,0.0014,0.8111,0.0001,3.6028,3.1606,0.0335,4.5088,0.8484,0.513,1.3934,2.2602,0.8827,6.235,0.5069,1.4268,6.4185,0.0012,4.793,0.9828,4.8502,2.8287,2.5363,2.8289,1.6003,3.2998,2.3522,2.5963,4.8351,2.6983,6.1782,4.5635,4.4928,0.5818,1.8402,11.2007,0.1637,3.3178,2.9567,0.0847,5.5296,1.1403,2.8962,2.445,3.2215,4.856,3.791,0.5125,5.2917,1.5577,5.1513,4.1495,1.558,0.3282,3.0456,3.3073,2.6168,0.6167,4.6672,0.8354,5.5153,1.0281,3.3276,5.5302,3.7083,2.6888,2.5963,6.0695,3.255,6.2409,3.3385,1.6197,0.8922,2.818,5.8487,2.2893,4.9594,0.5162,5.6237,2.7629,3.1648,1.0023,2.4827,1.8055,1.165,0.1396,1.1184,1.9409,5.9919,2.0128,9.1237,1.7292,1.9576,1.9732,3.9049,1.2632,3.2105,0.9356,0.9714,0.6794]}

A ship reported a gale and a pressure of 1 @, @ 006 mbar ( 29 @. @ 006 mbar ), the highest gale recorded during a Category 4 hurricane. \"We continue to expect this to continue, and while a sustained wind of 60 miles-per-hour (104 kilometers\/h) may have weakened to Category 5, we believe it would be the greatest gust ever recorded. And we are working through what we believe is the most probable risk,\" said Cristiana Nogueira, a meteorologist for the Southern Pacific Ocean. That means \"If we do have a tropical cyclone, which if it had wind of 100 mph (160 km\/h), it would be more significant as to the magnitude to which it would be powerful.\" The hurricane was tracking east at 7 miles-per-hour (16 km\/h) near the city of Reynosa, in Zacatecas Province, and had moved in from the north. It was moving at 50 mph (80 kg\/km). \"Very likely we will have a tropical cyclone within the next 10 or 15 days,\" said Nogueira, who said tropical weather conditions and tropical storm strength are being tracked closely by weather apps. \"If this is a tropical storm, then we will have a higher chance of seeing it within the next 10 days. If it is a cyclone, there is a higher likelihood that it will move up to the southwest of us.\" The winds are expected to reach 155 mph (265 km\/h), which could result in a significant storm surge. It could also bring a few inches (10 cm) or more of rain to Mexico City and other coastal cities. It will also bring severe rain.\n\nPhoto: REUTERS\/Luis Ram\u00edrez","token_len":374,"entropy":[8.2673,11.5366,2.2902,0.0167,3.422,4.8696,4.4583,0.6133,0.6853,0.043,4.5283,2.3634,3.4575,3.6066,1.1254,3.3651,7.4484,6.8044,2.2091,6.7864,0.0409,3.713,2.4046,7.1785,2.0366,2.8763,12.5958,6.5046,7.4612,10.1896,3.6576,2.9567,4.1368,3.4109,11.3476,7.3896,5.0041,5.5476,2.2861,0.8352,0.1761,0.0754,3.7772,3.1735,3.0357,5.4789,0.0183,1.2405,3.8072,1.7316,4.6134,1.2343,0.4033,1.3227,6.0907,3.5857,5.7584,0.1637,4.3048,3.5941,1.5506,1.8302,2.9494,1.7321,6.2101,4.3375,5.4452,2.0208,3.2339,4.5485,3.8241,5.2579,0.0744,0.4851,0.0358,1.7811,5.5022,1.5744,3.3226,0.0416,0.3087,2.2567,3.3757,5.3258,4.3109,5.5534,1.3837,1.0032,1.6749,2.7916,1.5081,4.2196,1.0763,3.8751,4.8753,6.1725,2.5287,0.2046,3.5435,5.7227,1.8039,1.6408,3.4154,5.1675,5.5509,0.8133,1.951,1.2663,1.1933,1.3641,3.2918,4.9045,2.2638,1.1676,7.776,3.6999,5.3243,3.4926,0.0018,0.3167,2.1433,2.494,0.1098,1.8872,0.6747,4.7786,4.0613,2.509,4.146,6.6524,4.1078,4.6603,6.3952,2.109,3.3394,3.0339,0.8504,2.0056,0.2899,0.0038,0.7366,5.7099,7.1544,0.5993,4.6499,6.2621,2.2846,3.0244,1.5329,2.289,4.006,0.5286,0.0392,0.0032,1.2129,0.9883,0.5294,1.0461,4.6115,5.0417,5.4918,4.466,1.5845,1.806,6.6192,4.5357,0.6415,1.1298,1.2833,5.932,1.2906,2.0557,2.5954,1.6376,9.2711,3.3464,2.1916,4.1924,3.6509,2.2996,0.0052,0.0003,0.0165,0.5935,3.7925,0.5185,0.3709,0.0122,0.8017,4.5218,0.8542,5.3871,0.0136,6.9064,0.0647,0.8475,2.8177,9.0747,0.0062,0.0014,5.1456,0.6823,3.4213,4.1568,4.1037,3.4071,2.9088,0.8091,3.2438,1.809,2.3669,0.7369,3.3361,1.3534,5.2579,0.3772,0.0963,3.0738,9.9753,0.611,4.3978,2.2132,2.6178,6.2898,2.5205,3.2813,0.8632,1.4192,0.8887,1.132,0.0997,0.0091,5.3191,1.0216,0.0769,3.664,3.3671,0.5196,0.4153,0.7416,0.6581,1.897,0.0105,0.0003,1.8797,1.444,2.1332,5.1039,5.7412,2.4581,4.1379,4.5504,1.9784,4.4649,1.7765,4.7018,3.7372,1.9791,1.1393,3.5339,6.3105,1.1616,1.9232,3.0665,3.2301,1.718,1.0097,1.1957,1.4625,0.3496,2.3166,1.211,1.6551,1.3018,1.2979,5.576,1.6339,0.1578,3.8214,1.321,5.0126,0.6203,0.0343,1.7444,0.4891,2.183,2.7727,0.8441,0.8689,0.8617,3.6089,0.0103,0.2269,4.1384,1.1073,0.8763,1.99,2.5159,1.2568,0.6933,0.5272,4.238,4.1365,1.7975,1.153,5.4828,1.8037,2.2596,1.5419,1.8742,4.8328,2.6151,0.946,0.0177,2.1153,5.6888,0.376,0.0356,6.3951,0.1336,0.0052,0.0034,1.1806,2.39,3.4136,4.7721,0.0159,1.1356,5.1463,2.5328,0.1117,1.0254,3.9082,1.8208,1.1822,3.0849,2.3915,5.5532,1.8177,1.4217,3.328,1.0781,0.0223,4.7332,0.2903,0.1201,0.2503,1.2779,2.528,1.2829,2.386,2.0681,3.1222,1.1268,0.7351,3.7099,3.415,2.0373,2.0578,4.429,4.4051,3.5635,2.3144,0.0165,4.8355,1.2994,4.4735,1.159,3.7343,0.3473,6.2739,0.3677,0.0]}

She gets a much stronger sense of her identity as she sees the power, and powers, of death above anything else she's ever had before. She then seeks to overcome any pain she feels for those dying and the people she loves, not just the ones she cares for. Her ultimate goal, as she seeks to unite the dead, is to hold onto her loved ones and help them rebuild.\nOn season 10, Prue faces two more death threats against her by Kyra from being held captive by a human ghost, and her death was a huge blow as she attempts to bring them back together for the first time since Prue started her own family practice. The episode also got to discuss Prue's past as she comes back to life, but is more concerned with her personal life in the years she's served. She realizes that she has lost a lot of power in her life that should have been hers forever. She feels bad about losing power in her own personal life and hopes that her return can bring it back, but her life isn't what it used to be. At this point, she's just hoping for what she wants...a safe place\u2014to come out.\nFor season 10, the series returns to a more natural state as the audience learns more about Prue's journey into being a mother and being a guardian of her children.

Liverpool had one match against Manchester United in the semi-finals. Liverpool had won the 1979 Champions League by the same goal as the United United and were a point behind Liverpool. Liverpool achieved their fourth Premier league title in the 1970s, and were named third in 1983. Liverpool was the only Premier League club to retain the Merseyside derby with Chelsea. Liverpool secured their first FA Cup triumph in 1987 with a 4\u20134 loss to Tottenham in the EPL. They also won the League Cup that year, with a 2\u20131 win at Sunderland. A series of injuries limited themselves to one player in the FA Cup final against the Scottish second-tier Lothians; goalkeeper James Lillis, manager of Newcastle United in the second round of the Cup, was sidelined after suffering a dislocation of the pelvic tendon in the Liverpool match; Liverpool were beaten out 2\u20131 in extra time by Rangers in the final. Liverpool's success in the FA Cup semi-final would serve as the title for the rest of the season. When both Merseyside and Tottenham Hotspur played in the Premier League in 1988-89 and 1991-92 respectively, Liverpool was the only Premier League club who won the FA Cup that season.","token_len":374,"entropy":[10.5299,6.4434,0.5577,0.3513,4.0943,3.1168,1.431,0.7716,9.0345,8.8517,2.2143,5.8745,0.4148,5.3841,10.0913,3.7581,7.3681,1.4364,1.319,4.2029,5.4644,3.6255,1.0119,4.639,0.4522,0.9469,10.9836,2.2973,5.3129,7.0648,6.6376,12.5629,6.7269,12.4021,3.887,2.4435,3.867,3.5616,1.4601,0.1914,3.8906,5.69,4.3515,2.6222,4.3985,1.6168,2.315,4.0215,5.5582,1.3144,2.5808,7.4049,0.0458,4.7138,0.4359,5.8981,5.5567,6.0021,8.3855,4.9621,4.328,2.1969,0.777,3.3672,6.1344,3.9091,2.0986,2.6176,2.9622,0.7809,0.3419,5.6733,7.3097,7.5265,5.1937,5.8971,5.4978,4.8212,3.7896,0.8339,7.3583,2.5946,4.2163,4.2784,0.1497,2.0688,1.2525,5.6741,3.9631,1.7386,1.4469,3.9309,1.2084,2.5768,6.505,5.4005,5.1001,3.8491,3.4127,3.7718,4.0347,1.675,1.2126,1.9365,2.7295,3.6395,0.7349,2.923,2.0381,3.5253,5.6306,0.0175,0.0027,6.1859,4.8776,3.5305,6.0174,0.7483,5.5271,2.7073,1.1891,1.2182,5.3735,3.109,1.7963,0.4568,1.0682,2.3221,3.3705,5.8063,3.9848,4.0622,5.1984,0.1848,1.2624,0.9705,3.9618,0.0465,0.7407,3.3179,2.483,2.9023,1.6962,1.316,5.4524,4.6328,0.0232,3.0456,4.5454,1.7966,6.3025,2.6544,1.9042,4.3625,5.6501,4.7342,2.958,4.5643,3.9782,0.8439,3.392,2.9546,2.1994,6.3884,1.922,4.1472,3.6445,5.8284,0.1605,0.6248,2.6674,3.6996,0.1936,1.8108,2.1075,2.3613,4.7557,6.5976,0.8984,4.2527,0.8062,1.5997,4.2512,2.6529,2.1149,3.4202,0.0748,0.9982,0.3047,5.6935,1.667,8.4089,0.04,0.0111,2.025,4.2473,5.102,1.7921,1.2305,5.3393,1.2915,1.319,2.5371,0.0164,5.1112,0.8241,4.793,2.2751,0.4673,2.3599,0.1695,2.5575,6.2167,0.7821,3.5991,3.0854,1.0332,5.9843,2.884,2.3809,2.695,2.8351,1.1954,0.6099,4.6596,0.2779,6.0703,0.5226,1.7459,3.2679,1.5462,1.4626,0.0359,0.9584,0.9388,2.2666,3.7883,0.8572,4.4266,6.5934,0.0353,3.5396,4.0518,8.4701,0.0984,3.5312,4.5214,1.4851,1.1032,5.2215,0.0196,1.2087,2.1063,4.1947,5.7037,7.3012,2.4345,1.2222,7.3298,3.1062,0.1975,6.0683,4.1611,5.8833,6.3165,4.5066,1.7459,2.4598,8.2693,1.9034,5.0174,0.2876,3.4026,0.8987,3.6985,0.356,0.8007,0.1417,4.2633,2.2504,1.097,4.3593,3.878,1.5632,0.2629,3.436,3.5667,1.0331,0.7598,7.6083,5.54,1.2499,2.0199,6.9032,4.5017,5.9716,3.7538,2.1055,3.4339,7.0453,4.9256,0.0487,0.7678,1.4205,5.9459,0.5027,0.681,4.5445,1.2611,0.3086,3.3262,1.7752,1.0853,2.9931,4.5798,0.8843,0.3662,1.9655,0.0035,2.8415,0.0134,0.9883,5.3773,5.7171,0.3552,1.6385,5.7326,3.9873,1.2369,5.3008,0.0025,0.5023,1.5777,0.7081,6.2721,6.5845,7.6598,0.0045,0.0138,2.2923,4.8183,2.1688,0.0014,2.7347,1.9391,0.3034,3.3225,0.0126,1.4561,2.8126,2.3031,0.0633,3.4271,3.3234,0.0718,0.0063,3.5226,0.0985,0.6688,4.5175,1.8341,1.2008,1.2716,0.0075,0.3484,4.1064,1.6947,0.972,1.8164,0.014,5.0631,0.6399,0.5526]}

It's a time of great concern for Somalia,\" Senno Muhamed, President Somali National Council (SONC), told Al Jazeera.\n\nSince that time, the national government and SNCM have worked to address the nation's financial and socio-economic problems, with the aim of helping people with their education, health care, and social programs.","token_len":375,"entropy":[8.18,3.857,0.0061,3.4862,6.54,1.8362,2.3801,4.0228,8.3951,0.0121,6.9074,0.0736,5.4476,11.3626,11.6579,4.8849,6.5551,2.683,1.3072,6.1069,6.6794,4.1773,4.7311,5.3864,1.9151,1.1271,0.019,0.0986,2.7295,3.282,1.0902,3.8945,6.3137,6.1341,0.8922,6.7714,0.942,7.5675,0.1954,9.8847,2.49,4.7156,0.0932,1.2213,2.3534,0.0348,3.5183,2.938,1.1813,3.3148,0.5626,6.1983,6.2739,1.07,4.9662,5.0766,2.094,1.1574,0.0011,2.9649,4.2676,0.2174,1.1598,3.268,5.1473,3.2109,0.0035,3.8708,3.0504,5.9554,1.9027,3.6548,3.4074,3.0808,0.3806,4.7136,3.4783,2.867,2.7657,0.3847,0.9557,6.4927,3.9878,3.0899,3.0097,3.8956,0.3643,2.5095,0.4266,1.4206,6.2793,4.4964,2.776,3.2191,4.2328,1.5218,1.1205,0.9417,1.4047,3.8282,5.9818,0.5807,1.343,1.845,5.4605,3.261,2.9924,0.0496,5.3214,1.6921,4.3083,5.2303,5.7524,0.976,8.567,0.3662,2.4578,2.2099,1.4719,5.3714,3.8203,0.0211,1.0295,3.2386,3.7092,0.727,5.361,0.4657,1.5071,1.0031,1.5297,1.963,4.5747,5.9503,1.5505,0.0094,0.502,4.6876,0.5047,3.6533,5.5423,0.533,0.7974,1.6975,1.1612,0.0002,2.6966,4.4346,0.1384,5.8492,3.4964,0.4047,0.3627,4.7498,0.5428,3.9905,1.6702,7.2793,0.8145,3.9561,1.4942,1.3653,2.0431,1.746,5.7564,4.4603,3.5955,1.2309,1.2474,5.9063,0.3992,1.2342,6.0966,2.9548,4.8408,6.4829,0.0163,6.0809,3.8593,2.8428,0.2216,0.5072,0.8405,3.6086,1.9398,2.3974,3.0655,3.7415,0.0975,0.6066,5.9874,2.7223,4.6935,2.7487,1.6888,0.0568,4.0804,2.8705,0.8024,1.0821,0.8184,0.0002,3.8913,6.6772,4.5927,3.1009,0.2438,1.1156,4.639,4.0333,2.6273,2.8922,7.1891,3.8327,2.5528,3.5017,5.738,0.4728,0.4111,6.1021,2.6597,1.3525,1.1048,1.7604,0.0537,5.257,1.486,1.9511,4.8688,1.9436,4.0128,0.0038,0.9686,4.691,3.8899,4.6784,2.5387,0.0009,2.0658,4.4227,4.6748,0.9524,2.958,1.42,4.7522,0.0118,2.719,0.3414,0.8972,0.703,0.0028,0.0073,4.2971,1.2841,2.5272,0.5309,6.4154,1.0142,0.0097,0.8575,4.4811,6.5475,3.5254,2.2694,3.8174,1.4621,4.2463,0.0342,1.6672,0.0603,0.01,6.7617,0.7116,0.528,0.0002,2.6307,3.5457,5.3516,5.8189,0.1854,2.5522,2.9254,2.9928,4.4938,1.8137,3.2036,0.0,0.0023,2.1145,4.3147,4.4652,2.0806,4.2799,1.6175,0.0119,0.168,1.5314,2.6298,5.0398,2.3572,1.8573,2.7795,3.492,1.7471,4.7137,0.8105,2.8064,3.2763,0.9926,2.3536,1.7029,3.3728,8.436,4.3365,3.8976,2.8322,2.6308,1.3811,5.0759,7.9372,0.7134,3.8647,1.4618,8.0221,0.5156,0.9163,0.8581,2.2159,0.3721,0.5122,0.6561,0.0001,4.8709,3.232,1.178,0.1295,1.3889,5.7965,2.1848,3.5279,3.232,0.0354,0.0096,0.1745,2.2131,1.7535,3.1537,0.8603,3.7618,0.0047,5.3216,1.9862,5.4989,0.0108,0.1868,0.6409,1.1859,2.6126,1.2993,1.8675,0.0539,4.3007,3.0763,3.9316,4.2178,4.7812,0.7103,1.2939,1.5728,0.9063,1.7764,2.4408,5.2524,0.3989]}

According to Kirsch, Vandernoot did not intend to add the episode to the season.\n\nThe season three finale \"The Devil and His Son\" was later adapted into a two-part TV series, including the first episode `` The Other \" ('' ) aired in March 2010.\n\nIn the Season 1 portion of the finale, Vandernoot will leave the scene, bringing the two stories back together.\n\nThe remaining three episodes of the fourth season of \"The Devil and That Son\" aired in October 2011.\n\nReception\n\nKirsch wrote that the season finale had the opposite effect because the two themes of the finale stayed as close as possible. She said that in his words: ''After a dramatic, intense climax, the whole scene was a bit too heavy on drama, but I don't think the plot is going to be too big or small for a sequel. The last few episodes felt too big or too heavy on romance, but then, with the exception of the last, it had some great plot twists, some interesting characters, some real depth and it was the most entertaining part of the season.\n\n''The second season finale, though, is what many people may have anticipated. It was less a storyline and more something that you wanted to do at some point in the story. It's a continuation of the series after a few hundred episodes, almost all being written for the first half of season two. There were many themes that followed that story that could not be resolved in a normal season.

Gott und die Natur was considered a \"new opera\" with musical direction by Herbert G\u00e4rt, though more than a dozen operas were performed in the German landscape between 1770 and 1805. Gott was also very fond of Erika S\u00f6yffler and his \"Berlin Tum\", where he made a complete and original series of productions, some of which became major successes.\n\nThe musical style of Gott was very early in the 19th century. The style developed by G\u00f6tz as well as more innovative ideas was introduced, including music as well as the use of sound design. Gott grew up in a very secular town and therefore his musical approach was somewhat difficult to translate. His father, G\u00f6tz, was a singer and composer and Gott was one of the first to use sound-design in music and cinema.

And it is here, with its spectacular pictures, that we finally make a very important discovery and today, thanks to the help of some very brave and determined citizens who have given themselves to this new observatory\".\n\nIn November 2010, Chile's government issued an announcement in favor and against a bill to establish a new observatory. The measure was adopted after three months of debate, with a majority of the public voting against a request from the National Center for Geophysical Observations (CGOM), which is responsible for the observatories in Chile.\n\nThe proposal requires all citizens who live inside the observatories to live in \"safe, well-stocked\" buildings, or in \"controlled\" housing, that means to have sufficient space for up to eight people per apartment, without disturbing neighbors and guests. The measure is supported by the government's own government as well as more than 300 members of their country's congress.\n\nIn January, the government of Chile announced that it would increase the capacity of its observatory by 720 members. Since last September, five people have been added to the observatories - which are located in Chile's most remote locations. (See map)\n\nIn its report to the National Center for Geophysical Observations (CGOM), the Chilean government said that the number of people in the observatories currently in place is 15 times the current capacity.","token_len":376,"entropy":[1.9909,1.5,8.467,9.216,0.0506,0.6143,2.5267,2.5682,5.9959,1.1815,0.1068,2.1556,4.0437,2.3037,8.5966,2.9276,3.3445,5.831,0.8794,0.187,1.372,6.74,3.6889,2.5153,8.3231,0.0001,3.0061,7.3653,13.7122,6.2513,7.7347,7.1589,4.2877,3.5028,2.726,5.7055,0.5921,3.5171,0.8103,3.1613,2.5446,3.2629,3.6649,1.4179,1.4348,0.0023,5.0528,7.0081,8.3699,2.6131,1.6902,3.8803,5.074,6.2902,1.038,2.641,0.5005,5.5177,0.2755,1.8024,1.9758,3.0255,3.2009,0.1371,0.0209,0.5497,1.2256,3.933,2.094,2.9303,4.9431,5.5808,1.0326,0.0632,5.8623,3.7426,2.1954,1.1279,6.3744,0.1465,2.0347,0.8498,3.1901,0.0002,2.2363,2.9653,2.2181,2.8174,2.8981,6.526,0.0028,1.2103,0.5434,1.5062,2.6067,1.8841,4.4409,2.5707,0.8248,2.7191,1.7899,3.4398,2.5266,5.6521,4.9463,0.9657,0.847,0.965,4.7324,4.9491,1.9822,5.0702,1.4232,2.36,3.8569,6.483,1.7319,5.7804,0.0279,0.7668,3.7916,0.0335,4.7489,2.9267,2.9934,2.4757,5.2513,3.705,3.6864,1.1336,3.9264,3.1382,1.5945,1.3409,4.4224,1.6285,0.0009,3.4604,0.2647,0.0003,3.5059,4.5238,3.5335,0.1788,3.7567,1.249,3.0551,3.9868,2.0556,2.6942,3.3274,5.0752,8.0662,1.3657,2.5008,6.3311,1.6409,2.4676,0.7225,0.7891,0.4531,0.0006,1.9555,1.4712,3.5506,1.0135,4.3411,2.9531,4.429,2.8081,0.2193,1.6985,1.8676,1.8414,3.0813,1.7236,0.3283,1.1216,3.1601,1.6902,1.1377,3.9714,5.0408,1.5761,0.5018,3.1103,3.9298,0.1211,5.8012,1.9706,8.7686,2.1939,1.1147,6.8423,2.7561,1.26,1.0427,2.4394,1.6644,0.0103,1.2958,3.2161,4.1315,2.323,0.9903,0.374,0.5459,0.0002,1.4258,3.7991,7.1265,2.9966,4.9232,3.5893,2.7872,6.3162,0.8448,3.0475,3.9502,0.424,5.5213,1.0739,3.9857,3.4488,1.8917,4.5596,0.1837,4.1633,0.3736,1.8932,3.9338,1.2009,4.4242,2.4094,2.1146,4.9198,2.6199,4.4919,1.2719,4.101,5.0687,5.594,1.853,5.9821,2.2366,0.9882,3.9482,0.0039,3.4844,0.4303,2.5003,4.1691,1.703,4.9676,6.3769,5.5392,2.7032,6.4918,0.5369,1.9551,2.9852,2.2363,3.7788,0.0687,1.172,2.9403,2.3472,2.7482,3.8447,5.5711,0.2421,0.2117,6.3392,0.1214,3.7874,3.6524,0.0678,7.9755,5.7187,0.0372,4.0003,0.6512,0.3378,0.0002,2.7668,3.4646,2.9326,1.194,1.8464,3.1065,0.8588,2.3625,0.9352,0.9002,0.844,4.8015,0.7162,4.7263,0.1953,1.4021,1.9284,0.4683,1.8039,9.614,6.3883,1.7359,4.8473,5.487,3.2804,0.2482,5.5312,3.5428,0.2404,0.9471,5.4254,0.2323,0.294,3.3831,1.9918,5.8961,5.5878,1.3753,1.769,0.7555,3.5893,0.2191,4.9268,2.1876,4.5554,1.4741,6.2842,2.4478,3.0234,2.2946,0.3349,0.0002,2.6222,5.3694,3.5852,2.4849,0.4193,2.949,0.9785,0.1373,0.0564,0.0098,0.2674,0.5073,1.3883,0.4861,0.0011,0.2066,0.5201,3.7061,0.5064,1.5314,0.6705,1.3698,4.4545,0.0279,1.3549,2.383,1.3581,1.4233,0.5911,5.0404,2.2939,3.4577,1.6445,6.4275,4.5863,1.8223,3.0064,2.376,0.9833]}

{"id":3363,"ended":true,"length":359,"text":"The music video for `` Do or Die `` was directed by Leto, who was credited as pseudonym Bartholomew Cubbins. Leto developed its concept as a companion piece to the music video of`` Do or Die ``, which is a movie about a man who goes to Japan to save the world from destruction, and who is a Christian missionary who seeks to save the entire world from the dangers of nuclear war. A lot of the film features a male, mostly male American director with a Japanese accent. Leto says, \"I love women, but I don't think I've ever seen a female female female and I've never watched a male one except for a couple of scenes. I also like male voices. To get that out of the way, there are also certain scenes in the film that have female voices as to male actors. So I just love how there was no vocal actress in this movie. I thought a male voice was beautiful. It was more than beautiful I thought. I just love the sound that women can do in this world.\"\n\nAlso, leto talks about the need to include \"traditional\" language in the story in order to maintain the tension or tension of the plot of the movie and to retain the \"classic\" tone of the film.\n\nAnother highlight in the film is that the movie is a sequel to `` Do or Die,'' ''The Woman in the White Clothes ''and `` '' The Woman in the White Clothes,'' `` Do Or die `` and `` If You Get Here Later'' and '' Are You All right?'' '' Do or die '' and '' Are you All right?'' are among the film's favorite songs.\n\nAll the sound effects were developed by Leto himself and produced by Biodontology and the film's executive producers.

Nash also considered signing with New York or Philadelphia. Nash, who is currently the Lakers rookie of the year, was one of the NBA\u2019s top scoring shooters while shooting a career-high 39.7 percent (8-for-27) from deep in his season-opening career.\n\nNash started all 24 games on the season and finished with 38 points, 8 boards, 6 assists and 3.6 assists in 19 minutes, playing on the offensive end and shooting 55.8 percent from the field in 38 games.\n\nNash said after the trade deal with the Philadelphia 76ers that he wanted to get a more consistent shooter on his team to help him develop his game. The move back to the LA Lakers was an effort to get Nash a shot at a future title contender that also provided him with a chance for the 2019 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans.\n\nAs a result, Nash spent the majority of his first year with the Los Angeles Lakers where he averaged 6.0 points or 8.3 points per game. As a player in his rookie year he\u2019s already seen better playing time and production.\n\nNash is a perfect example of what can happen when playing better. As an all-time figure in scoring, he\u2019s actually averaging a career-high 8.0 points per game while shooting 39.2 percent from beyond the arc, but also has been an all-around great shooter who can score the ball and produce both free-hand and back-to-back blocks.\n\nAt 20 years old, Nash already has the potential to be one of the most important players in the game moving forward as he becomes a leader off of the court.","token_len":376,"entropy":[7.612,3.4377,0.1756,3.2206,0.2021,1.8628,5.7868,0.0034,3.9576,4.6846,8.326,3.3417,0.2636,8.5861,17.405,10.7274,4.9584,7.0883,2.3879,2.1595,3.2457,1.2319,7.6384,2.8479,4.4546,0.8532,1.4161,5.9823,9.6142,3.5742,0.7285,3.5653,0.919,4.1367,3.184,1.3714,1.9651,3.5907,1.8436,2.3933,2.8987,3.4486,2.5977,4.075,0.1186,0.0046,0.1818,0.4143,2.011,4.3258,0.021,0.5292,3.0916,16.55,7.399,2.1533,1.6767,4.0078,3.6413,5.433,2.0772,2.8884,0.772,0.2392,0.2055,3.1669,0.3314,2.237,0.2281,3.7387,4.1928,0.6326,0.74,0.0078,3.34,0.2218,0.2744,3.447,1.4093,2.1896,5.0374,1.0016,0.4578,5.603,1.3357,2.1358,0.0011,1.865,0.0086,4.7762,2.4963,4.3818,0.1169,3.979,0.5833,2.1317,1.727,3.0151,0.5491,4.8512,0.0683,0.8944,4.1198,4.6565,0.8092,2.5421,0.1559,0.6231,2.4935,3.7933,2.6342,2.5682,0.6921,4.195,1.7651,2.9688,5.8437,3.7432,0.9249,5.0224,1.045,2.8744,2.7097,4.4193,0.8329,2.2408,0.0156,0.6904,0.3339,0.2347,2.7766,4.9617,1.996,0.5595,1.5247,0.0003,1.0944,0.0075,5.2711,3.318,0.6084,0.769,7.0609,3.09,1.5906,2.3257,0.0754,0.0001,1.0361,0.338,2.7066,0.1323,4.0169,2.6415,4.8693,2.0857,5.2543,3.1119,1.8057,0.79,4.4946,1.6326,2.8354,2.8794,2.4933,0.4343,0.552,3.6513,4.2677,5.9831,0.9884,1.1226,6.7755,0.2517,2.1199,3.0888,3.0964,0.643,1.8008,0.1738,2.3751,3.4717,0.7166,1.8266,4.0624,4.9389,3.5813,4.3278,5.067,5.2626,1.2645,0.6126,0.9595,1.6491,4.0518,3.0568,8.461,1.2719,1.1376,0.0196,0.012,0.2471,3.0731,2.8773,0.7295,0.3185,0.4678,0.0003,5.4938,1.8152,2.2622,0.6947,0.1485,4.0945,0.765,2.5,0.0006,1.3487,3.2189,2.4535,1.5752,0.1622,2.8339,0.0012,0.1434,4.4957,0.0657,1.0538,4.0258,0.0182,2.517,0.1623,7.433,6.7467,0.0263,2.0821,4.4506,0.9254,0.0635,1.4265,4.545,0.6635,4.8236,3.7078,1.9332,2.7539,1.0392,2.8112,18.7133,1.6633,0.5459,5.0454,4.8269,4.2185,5.5215,0.1559,1.967,4.8545,2.4827,0.9508,0.0002,1.1697,0.0029,2.5559,2.1011,6.3909,3.0233,0.1362,2.082,2.6509,0.5458,0.4338,5.8368,5.658,2.2533,3.4496,2.5876,3.7849,0.1085,2.645,9.4669,1.2474,4.9646,1.0515,1.4652,4.096,0.4946,0.0096,6.6751,4.1237,2.6801,1.2593,0.545,0.2586,3.547,0.0371,2.1562,0.1398,0.7336,0.0546,2.753,0.8114,3.7686,0.1238,2.5192,0.0084,0.3598,3.4719,0.022,0.0161,2.8245,4.2947,3.0012,3.3152,2.6551,3.5479,2.8551,0.018,1.2594,2.0334,3.8067,2.1543,2.6564,2.8739,4.0432,0.6219,2.6049,6.9285,6.3945,4.5778,2.661,4.9888,1.1665,6.1261,1.0513,0.0894,0.0006,0.0752,4.9884,0.5506,0.5382,0.0002,4.966,5.5728,0.6704,0.1054,0.4513,0.3219,4.7184,0.451,1.634,2.0678,0.0907,1.0011,1.8272,0.0152,0.0499,2.0877,2.853,0.955,0.3766,0.3833,2.8422,7.154,0.0211,3.7274,0.8401,4.0313,0.8586,4.7464,6.653,2.2714,1.0772,3.3904,0.6185]}

{"id":3402,"ended":false,"length":322,"text":"An unfinished pyramid located in north Abusir, between the sun temple of Userkaf and the Pyramid of Sahure, is believed to belong to Shepseskare. The structure was discovered in 1980 by a young Egyptian woman, who had been working as an underground clerk at a local Egyptian bank, before she became involved in an attempt to steal a priceless gold product of the time. As the gold was stolen through \"sacrificed\" procedures, Shepseskare lost the gold and lost the product. She says she believes that the theft was done in the interests of \"the interests of Egyptian government, but also by Egyptian businessmen and politicians\u2026 and not by any particular person.\" She is now searching for the source of the pyramid. The Egyptian national security council had issued an investigation and was searching for Shepseskare to assist in the rescue of the stolen gold.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to extract Herpes virus from the pyramid, Shepseskare tried to obtain Herpes virus from the pyramid that was in the form of an enzyme that was produced by a small cell in the mouth of a man known to have transmitted the virus to his wife. Unfortunately, Shepseskare managed to break and destroy the DNA extracted from the pyramid\u2019s DNA, without ever knowing how much Herpes virus material was collected, and was eventually traced as well. Herpes virus was later destroyed by the Egyptian authorities and Shepseskare\u2019s DNA was turned into a fragment of Herpes virus. Herpes virus was eventually replaced with Herpes virus for many of the other cases. Recently, the pyramid was completely destroyed by the pyramids in both countries (Egypt and Egypt).\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\nA copy of the pyramid was made available at\nEgyptian Museum of Antiquities","token_len":376,"entropy":[11.8254,9.8213,7.1444,1.0405,6.1156,10.2616,7.4623,4.3616,1.8913,6.831,1.695,9.0233,6.4989,2.5098,13.6247,7.5403,8.6077,2.2525,0.7104,6.0669,0.2377,9.3962,11.5301,2.049,3.1006,4.3751,0.0381,4.3987,0.0053,7.3489,5.567,7.642,6.096,8.2425,1.8829,2.1174,4.7235,1.1963,2.7518,1.0031,5.2422,1.2408,2.115,5.1786,3.8801,3.4794,2.3157,1.4,2.3015,1.8701,3.2005,1.6827,2.0286,6.425,6.9588,1.4823,1.4545,2.762,5.0681,4.367,2.1988,4.6602,1.6366,3.037,3.5196,0.5937,3.2432,3.373,0.0815,2.9051,2.2595,4.3991,3.1086,7.748,4.477,0.7941,5.9894,0.32,4.6997,1.5214,4.6071,0.9668,2.7227,6.0556,6.5028,6.2852,1.0954,0.2757,3.9548,1.7449,6.5011,0.3787,2.9466,0.0265,0.0096,0.0192,0.0112,3.426,1.7613,2.8481,1.5255,3.9611,1.5142,4.5563,0.8427,2.8399,6.5574,1.2108,4.658,1.2546,1.1705,3.6889,1.0131,2.6156,2.6822,2.236,7.4888,0.001,3.2901,2.4868,5.862,0.0871,5.5161,5.302,2.7462,2.8984,2.1748,5.0211,4.7356,3.5588,2.0226,3.8651,6.1344,3.5787,2.9111,1.4146,2.1579,4.9131,3.4334,1.4353,2.6114,4.0734,2.5086,4.9693,0.1003,1.4613,2.2579,0.158,0.1594,5.6805,1.1247,2.7657,3.7024,5.9095,5.4343,3.5747,4.2056,4.2865,1.9461,4.0323,2.9907,3.2197,5.2434,0.2363,4.2157,0.0095,0.0046,0.0076,0.0197,3.2428,4.5921,1.1736,1.2029,4.5375,1.3384,0.3362,2.3593,1.0726,0.4347,2.0003,0.0775,4.6337,2.9499,4.9062,0.3348,0.5018,5.521,5.7293,3.2468,8.1324,0.501,0.9383,3.125,0.7757,2.1824,0.0181,0.0055,0.0079,0.0043,4.6192,0.3604,4.949,6.5447,0.0072,0.9771,0.6603,1.0416,3.1776,5.945,1.4722,3.127,1.1986,4.1934,0.031,2.7318,5.5111,1.9074,2.039,4.3535,0.6863,2.1038,4.1291,3.7856,1.8514,0.5188,5.8304,0.2291,1.2413,4.4937,4.2801,2.7171,1.8499,6.9513,1.091,0.2523,1.2926,2.5413,1.6088,0.5702,4.9656,0.2813,2.9486,0.0063,0.0018,0.004,0.003,3.6711,0.0177,4.7296,5.6687,2.2716,0.3167,5.3692,5.3627,0.2018,0.1579,2.1784,14.7948,6.9887,6.48,1.7524,1.7077,6.1346,3.7244,3.7836,2.9844,4.0666,3.623,0.0038,0.0644,7.7012,0.9979,6.6759,2.8854,1.0874,3.4664,3.7388,5.239,6.1713,3.9678,0.56,3.4904,0.0075,0.1106,1.1246,3.3997,5.7045,0.9068,1.6899,2.128,2.2276,2.4446,3.8555,0.0077,0.002,0.0043,0.0033,13.5883,0.1674,0.3171,4.243,0.2982,5.493,0.756,0.9218,6.8379,0.5407,2.3383,0.0544,0.122,1.4661,3.4079,0.0157,0.0597,1.0083,2.8557,5.477,1.6425,2.0742,0.0311,0.786,5.6744,5.9933,5.604,0.7359,3.2729,4.7632,1.8297,7.2055,0.2789,1.9222,5.7701,1.2311,4.9609,1.0307,1.3124,1.4345,5.0961,0.2409,3.5287,6.6111,5.1961,4.568,3.0235,0.1891,2.137,2.3452,0.751,0.0003,3.9586,0.9428,0.0004,5.9825,0.8135,0.0003,5.6204,0.8803,0.5741,0.0002,4.9342,5.0726,0.0272,1.5174,5.6451,3.7647,4.4929,1.3916,2.5256,4.3257,25.0027,0.8951,4.3015,0.6495,2.4231,0.0202]}

A vessel in the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company reported a hurricane on August 27, about halfway between the United States and the Caribbean. The US president announced he would be suspending international flights to the US and warned that it would disrupt trade.\n\nIt also impacted the US, with major shipping companies including the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDSOT) said it was not sure when the next hurricane would hit, and the White House said it hoped this would happen within the next week.\n\nOther US major ships also lost power. That means they won\u2019t be able to move cargo or food from the vessel to their destination.\n\nMeanwhile, there are reports of more significant hurricanes on the Pacific Ocean.

It is expected to reach the US early next week and is expected to intensify into a storm this weekend.\n\nIt could bring widespread flooding to parts of Puerto Rico, at least until at least the Sunday morning (June 25), the United States National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.\n\nA week after the first major winter storm of this year, Hurricane Sally also struck at the southwest Caribbean island of Cuba.","token_len":377,"entropy":[7.2537,9.9992,2.7543,0.6016,2.1024,2.3753,6.3342,6.7225,6.7869,0.0187,5.3089,5.9665,4.5709,6.5352,1.7461,3.9133,5.3825,2.8039,0.8756,6.3035,4.8583,11.507,8.3019,4.375,4.6073,5.6066,2.5328,4.037,2.2654,4.4146,3.5091,0.8357,7.1188,7.1056,2.5784,1.9793,4.0844,0.3904,0.0875,2.41,1.1442,0.5106,1.6363,5.2728,7.5051,4.2551,3.8481,1.2489,2.1065,3.6934,4.9638,2.0981,0.9798,1.2718,2.6376,2.716,6.1729,1.2193,2.6167,0.7872,5.7703,3.4055,1.4093,1.1283,0.0009,4.3733,3.6634,5.2783,1.9976,2.3732,4.8221,2.668,5.8545,3.1202,1.4693,2.1885,1.4326,4.3857,0.0088,0.0365,0.1439,3.4317,0.001,1.7692,3.3415,1.637,3.9327,6.0179,0.309,6.4151,1.5751,1.1518,3.2744,5.2102,3.0198,1.3044,4.8834,0.3837,0.3703,0.8612,2.7326,2.4427,1.9593,4.0972,0.0005,0.973,0.8486,4.9861,4.9485,1.4797,3.2184,2.1017,1.3744,0.1373,2.0082,0.6377,0.4462,0.0002,5.4568,3.9572,6.134,2.8788,2.7439,4.139,0.604,2.429,6.5775,2.6107,2.5959,3.8046,17.7042,7.0378,2.2631,0.6208,0.1096,0.0063,4.0014,3.19,2.4789,3.7757,3.0719,1.5338,7.4099,1.1491,2.5809,2.2181,0.8827,0.8563,0.0003,5.1734,0.1341,4.3278,1.5795,1.5533,1.3003,3.3836,6.1529,2.1575,2.8279,0.184,5.5086,2.6712,1.1719,2.2866,5.4911,5.2438,2.4671,1.7927,0.7862,7.7747,0.1886,3.3345,5.0085,0.6865,1.0805,2.3487,4.3179,0.671,4.7424,2.3612,0.2117,0.6611,3.6107,3.7265,2.0218,4.9241,2.801,0.9413,0.0002,6.1503,4.7508,2.2123,3.1713,2.463,0.7779,2.8155,6.9255,0.7161,6.0932,5.6353,0.1161,1.8817,4.4876,5.9518,6.3454,1.9912,2.9706,3.0752,4.5229,0.0028,0.0437,0.0933,1.8474,0.0033,3.9652,2.3801,0.5045,3.6795,3.9217,2.8336,3.4512,1.2737,1.376,1.6965,0.5751,0.0003,1.8612,4.8324,3.2783,0.5882,4.293,1.0731,3.7168,1.6798,1.9025,0.0156,3.6105,3.3423,1.9011,4.2213,6.0233,6.5593,4.1648,1.9969,2.2785,1.5855,0.8597,0.0003,5.368,5.2334,0.5677,0.0648,2.8584,3.8034,0.0732,4.8288,4.7,1.1804,1.9471,4.0144,1.1942,0.0387,2.3899,1.2359,0.0003,4.9757,0.0388,4.8456,4.5432,3.5016,1.9821,4.1451,6.7543,0.4174,3.066,0.871,0.6416,3.0023,0.5977,0.5347,3.376,6.7679,2.9567,3.9379,5.0595,0.1638,0.2864,0.8079,2.0364,1.367,0.0091,0.6804,3.7712,0.9652,2.0864,0.0962,2.9956,1.5207,3.2275,5.3265,0.2924,0.2657,2.6773,2.4668,0.8323,0.0197,4.7963,2.472,0.5662,4.0626,4.2179,0.9337,0.235,0.6195,0.0002,4.1819,3.9565,3.7942,5.2682,2.0766,1.8765,1.6954,0.0018,5.3572,0.0007,1.0133,6.8629,0.4887,5.2952,5.2637,0.0075,1.9882,5.9192,2.0884,3.6436,4.331,3.2996,3.3846,3.2419,4.9258,1.0475,2.7349,0.2754,0.0113,2.4569,1.2546,0.0032,0.0613,0.5314,0.7457,0.4712,0.0002,3.8251,6.0389,2.3234,1.4989,3.5372,2.855,8.4052,0.1215,2.6199,4.3749,0.9522,0.9139,2.1222,9.5908,4.3888,2.8477,6.0938,1.2105,6.0948,5.1668,1.6323,0.1289,4.5995,0.8045]}

{"id":4702,"ended":true,"length":353,"text":"Analysis of the jaw design of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues ( 1998, 2004, 2009 ) suggests that the animal was capable of quick bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites, like bite on the nose or jaw, are very dangerous, resulting in serious injuries, sometimes even death,. It is thought that a small bite was probably necessary for Carnotaurus to survive as it was too deep for a snake to bite, and the bite must be deep. The same approach applies to Carnotaurus, and it is thought that the bite would make a very sharp stick and would be difficult to use.\n\nIt is suggested that Carnotaurus has only two jaws. One is located in the front part of the fore limb that covers the back and has a slightly curved surface beneath the top to form a tail. The front portion is very curved, and its shape is known as the \u2018slab mouth\u2019. The second animal also bears a curved jaw, which is more curved and is known as the slab tongue. The slab mouth is more closely spaced from the front leg than the other one, however, this is partly because the jaw has a larger area of open jaw. Both jaw types have the same shape and size, but in the slab mouth the tongue extends farther from the jaw, allowing for a sharp bite as well as more bite.\n\nBecause of the large size and the fact that it is almost identical to Carnotaurus, there is a considerable increase in the risk of injuries and deaths, and this could be caused by bite on the nose or on the jaw. For the avoidance of doubt both the front and back teeth of the Carnotaurus are the exact same length. In the front tooth the mouth is longer and the jaw is narrower.\n\nThis analysis suggests that Carnotaurus bears this head of the slab mouth.","token_len":377,"entropy":[3.1863,1.589,10.4648,8.0637,2.0307,10.0684,2.0975,4.5157,4.9631,5.2174,5.9035,5.2789,2.077,3.1692,2.0348,8.7724,5.1266,3.9992,2.3088,2.5562,1.715,2.6319,0.2291,0.8464,5.4659,2.2659,5.0506,0.0069,9.0207,7.5569,1.7902,2.2784,1.9994,6.1661,2.6789,0.5498,9.1344,0.6727,2.8755,3.424,3.3176,5.2174,1.0444,3.6576,1.9734,3.0266,0.2312,1.3839,3.9787,4.9812,2.2724,5.6123,0.0119,2.2168,1.6779,2.7616,5.4022,1.934,0.2594,11.2039,4.2378,0.6661,3.1549,0.1017,3.4855,3.7203,1.9834,3.9428,4.0557,3.7657,2.0763,4.2848,0.0012,0.1856,0.3617,2.303,4.5924,1.6325,1.5107,5.7913,7.0449,1.6675,2.5313,5.5297,0.4443,2.4979,2.0894,1.4123,2.3903,1.5028,3.5184,3.2493,5.4311,4.2569,2.0866,5.3566,4.6961,4.3606,0.3144,3.6477,0.0052,0.0724,2.2971,2.8845,2.3254,0.7137,2.1657,0.1206,1.3838,1.4514,4.4425,5.8791,2.3523,3.7472,3.1402,6.6,3.7923,2.9825,2.2806,3.0483,0.2152,4.5221,1.2456,2.1334,0.0118,3.7888,0.5079,4.0333,0.1071,1.491,0.0019,0.0972,3.8885,5.2945,2.5022,3.2325,1.7989,2.7526,1.0366,4.4278,1.809,0.3252,2.8071,4.0889,0.0446,0.3619,6.2478,7.1568,4.891,4.668,0.2154,3.0273,3.1073,4.0803,0.9592,4.6099,1.5626,3.2045,6.9264,1.6737,3.9931,5.6102,4.242,0.473,4.4118,0.7624,0.5476,5.3449,2.5162,1.8571,3.9044,3.9102,0.9844,1.1962,4.0514,3.2311,1.1067,5.0332,1.0695,1.4289,10.3792,6.128,5.3167,2.5986,5.5058,1.4935,5.5776,0.7881,0.7908,3.1435,7.2918,4.9763,5.9631,1.0287,4.4644,2.6288,1.212,1.8258,0.858,3.8988,3.7133,2.2069,2.712,2.8494,0.1524,0.3143,7.7538,3.1225,1.2773,1.2396,2.1804,2.8666,0.7185,4.4277,4.1489,4.135,3.541,0.1422,1.1338,5.823,2.0863,0.2881,3.4409,5.9379,0.4767,6.1411,0.4233,3.0158,1.2846,5.8171,1.2319,1.0568,3.2433,3.1939,1.0494,3.3793,3.347,1.7328,5.3454,5.1518,2.3767,5.1981,3.1021,2.0662,1.5869,2.5783,0.247,2.5373,1.5231,2.8861,0.7674,1.5625,3.9347,1.944,1.5498,1.2495,1.4526,4.5794,3.4963,4.6338,2.536,0.0502,3.8075,1.9858,4.3435,1.746,1.562,4.2687,0.366,5.2282,0.959,0.1747,4.3411,3.327,2.7319,1.4287,0.0002,5.1125,1.5653,0.7155,2.1984,1.3176,2.3951,2.4719,3.0987,0.0203,2.2037,0.8426,4.7583,4.0175,0.646,1.9419,0.0023,0.0077,0.4473,3.7349,0.5064,1.6186,4.3697,6.4668,0.0879,0.7546,4.6425,0.2254,3.4058,3.1812,2.2899,3.758,2.0172,2.7224,4.1114,1.0677,3.2694,0.1697,4.6667,0.7941,0.1095,2.1259,0.5762,4.9341,0.0567,1.0597,0.6475,4.4362,3.0246,5.9477,0.0046,1.7794,8.1581,2.1981,4.2705,0.4018,0.6548,2.9458,1.5097,1.5889,4.9338,0.001,0.0257,1.1905,3.9702,6.4684,0.0414,2.825,1.4333,2.9893,1.9215,2.8326,3.1323,1.8362,3.6482,0.604,3.841,1.9442,1.1447,2.7776,0.9962,2.3422,0.7066,3.2075,0.0002,4.2285,5.0874,2.3007,0.0703,0.9165,0.0014,0.042,6.7659,6.3183,5.6745,2.4538,1.6766,5.052,1.5059,2.4568]}

The lunar record is the largest ever and included one of the most important known lunar missions of all time, when Gemini 15 of the Space Shuttle carried out its mission to Mars.\n\nSince that NASA-sponsored mission, a record has been broken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter which was launched onto the moon in January of 1976 following a two-day trip to the red planet by Buzz Aldrin, later known as Gemini 17.","token_len":377,"entropy":[5.3423,10.0313,1.0238,3.9444,3.4101,1.9839,7.2333,2.6569,1.4372,1.0131,2.6486,4.4296,1.7822,1.4633,1.1039,3.8118,5.0227,1.9866,4.3409,0.1396,2.385,0.8242,12.5393,0.327,0.0105,0.5929,3.2663,1.9282,9.4898,2.7221,0.9234,12.8519,8.8252,6.0995,2.3286,2.0169,7.0618,5.4568,2.5676,4.2375,5.903,3.6605,0.0479,2.3695,1.1132,4.0166,2.7498,5.7863,1.1507,6.3285,1.1532,2.6686,3.4926,3.2743,2.6416,4.522,3.0424,1.217,3.9506,1.3754,0.3668,1.8724,5.8614,0.6083,0.7381,1.2091,0.9187,1.1221,4.8851,4.9721,3.5295,3.3091,1.7213,3.8121,6.467,1.6843,1.558,5.0041,2.6103,1.201,0.6493,5.3644,6.3577,2.8024,4.9395,1.7909,5.6483,1.9249,2.911,2.2095,0.8421,0.8355,3.0627,1.3405,1.0981,0.0025,5.9783,2.8263,0.7791,1.1608,1.3689,0.2199,5.3227,3.6583,4.8776,0.2093,0.1175,2.4938,0.2649,5.6896,5.9225,2.4801,1.5085,7.1134,6.73,0.8707,1.3893,0.004,4.4059,7.2147,0.7907,7.1008,2.1692,4.6903,4.2285,0.6025,1.9756,0.3743,4.8988,4.3639,4.1456,4.4589,2.4522,1.5796,0.8806,2.4477,0.3322,0.8432,0.8457,1.8122,3.4017,4.4062,3.1108,3.7415,0.9763,0.7722,0.7282,5.2383,0.0337,0.7249,1.6579,0.0002,4.3967,3.3886,3.6858,0.7291,2.0348,0.1365,0.8878,3.2816,2.0737,0.9722,0.4066,1.1204,3.7816,3.526,2.013,1.9639,5.8195,4.6783,1.962,4.1915,5.6436,3.5772,1.1384,0.6583,0.0002,6.3911,3.9911,0.1989,4.3658,2.4875,3.9644,5.2685,0.7128,1.6988,3.9836,1.5061,1.3639,2.2299,3.0448,4.3033,1.2687,5.5762,0.2395,4.0121,7.8489,3.6608,4.5904,4.6462,6.1788,7.7395,3.1015,5.4275,0.0019,3.7131,0.5978,0.7815,0.6915,2.7664,3.3073,5.5235,0.7223,1.4956,0.0002,2.0742,1.6437,5.4841,1.2657,4.658,1.8583,3.222,1.1656,13.0973,1.9683,1.7627,3.7098,8.4895,7.6508,3.9764,4.8533,2.4782,1.373,4.0901,5.3099,0.0022,2.9998,0.999,3.9809,2.9691,1.9166,3.14,1.4808,2.6741,0.0963,4.7218,1.71,4.0804,1.9623,4.8789,0.0001,5.2943,1.7366,4.0706,3.47,5.2876,0.1594,2.4618,2.6015,2.5026,0.2597,0.7446,0.0001,1.9125,4.6196,0.0002,1.731,1.0965,0.0001,4.3561,4.7947,3.5794,0.1929,1.825,4.8441,3.2367,2.9735,0.9823,0.0091,0.9215,3.908,4.2133,4.8703,5.4556,5.4329,0.0227,1.4841,0.3078,0.7628,1.2745,4.745,3.7209,2.0046,2.6575,3.7978,1.581,4.4299,5.5261,5.4392,1.4538,0.249,1.5546,4.2683,6.2835,3.263,2.9273,2.7665,0.9253,0.0649,1.315,5.8371,6.4526,4.664,6.2864,0.464,2.5199,0.028,3.7775,2.7419,1.2524,2.6771,1.3674,3.8211,0.8298,0.7016,0.0001,4.0985,3.0287,6.936,3.7126,1.6487,1.4284,0.7288,3.2625,5.311,3.0662,0.1463,2.2032,3.1756,1.3641,4.3175,0.6798,0.0003,0.001,0.0016,4.5855,2.5627,0.8963,7.1872,0.3214,0.782,0.655,3.4146,3.61,3.1032,6.5185,1.2561,3.9902,0.3528,2.4881,2.9993,0.8039,0.612,4.8541,0.0797,5.0983,5.9004,0.0017,0.0,2.2383,5.2896,1.4878,0.0388,5.8653,2.8781,0.2263]}
{"id":4485,"ended":true,"length":343,"text":"The main predators of the house martins are those birds of prey which are capable of catching these agile fliers, such as the hobby ( Falco subbuteo ). Birds of the Delichon species, have been recorded in the wooded areas. The most common species is the common martins, which are known as fliers or a guide dog. There are several family of the common martins and there are now four types of martins.\n\nOne of the rarest species of the species has been found in the forests of Brazil and Paraguay, where fliers are usually found and kept up to two and five years old. Fliers can live for up to three years. Fliers are often seen up close when they hunt but the birds have little movement until about a pound of flesh is provided. The birds prey upon animals they have not previously seen, or are unaware of \u2014 and rarely eat. Fliers are best photographed out in nature, as they tend to run in circles on the water, and often come in small numbers, while most fliers are large in size.\n\nThe common martins live in tropical rainforests in the Southern Hemisphere and are often seen in rivers of rain, dank water ponds or wetlands where fauna is restricted by vegetation\n\nAnother common species that attracts fliers is the black martins, which are found in the western tropical forests of Africa, Europe and eastern Asia. Because they are so small in size, they can weigh more than ten and forty ounce pieces and they are known to be able to use their bodies for many of the same purposes. These birds may spend their time on water, and therefore the fliers are a danger to the human ecosystem. The black martins are also highly sensitive to the effects of salt, and the food they eat is also valuable in the conservation of nature.","token_len":377,"entropy":[6.6973,10.6121,1.1468,1.3096,7.6112,11.841,1.926,0.855,4.4297,5.8385,3.1065,0.0928,3.0942,1.7176,4.8213,0.0181,5.3812,5.6264,10.3263,6.3889,2.1549,2.1263,3.2621,0.0091,1.3793,11.6685,7.4307,13.7868,1.6663,8.3223,5.9936,6.4468,8.3852,1.7102,6.9818,0.5668,5.8935,10.6533,8.9564,5.2259,3.4655,2.2075,6.0072,1.3271,4.0073,1.767,1.439,6.0,1.8844,1.035,4.0484,1.9405,3.6866,0.7781,1.8154,2.7031,0.5831,5.2647,1.9544,1.8425,1.5193,0.8993,1.0942,3.7663,1.4175,4.6371,0.4348,2.9838,5.6694,8.4718,4.1142,0.5834,4.1376,0.2065,2.7408,6.6803,1.5851,4.4162,2.4339,0.1377,0.0816,2.8659,3.2722,0.2164,6.0122,4.0769,5.0701,0.4158,1.8789,0.1479,1.5102,2.4994,0.135,5.0208,0.7745,0.151,6.063,0.2408,1.2058,1.0184,0.9719,4.3394,4.896,0.6395,1.5338,0.4907,0.7022,4.0409,0.2766,4.4315,2.6582,3.495,0.0043,1.5604,2.1077,5.6519,0.0455,0.7371,4.6045,1.0088,3.7787,5.1262,6.258,0.7251,2.7345,4.5283,4.9048,0.7468,1.2917,0.3103,5.5185,0.0878,3.0237,5.1334,1.1589,1.0782,0.0023,2.3698,0.3231,2.4966,4.6319,0.0968,0.9196,3.3103,3.4684,5.3054,2.1042,4.2632,1.7791,5.2678,4.9695,3.2017,3.225,3.4825,4.2629,5.6008,5.6263,3.1228,2.9461,8.7466,2.7417,3.5427,0.7107,6.9992,1.0674,1.5615,2.3559,7.344,2.8282,6.5156,5.7786,2.1114,1.7256,4.3342,0.747,1.551,4.8923,3.1129,3.0932,0.2147,9.9355,3.6887,5.3496,3.2672,0.6017,3.3913,0.06,0.9107,5.3413,7.1579,6.4891,1.9443,4.6321,1.4915,3.273,0.8343,4.322,0.0831,6.3465,2.7659,2.8134,3.4375,0.72,5.657,2.0098,1.7603,3.1483,4.4969,2.0499,3.0474,3.1927,3.0467,5.6732,3.9484,2.625,0.0132,1.0278,3.5318,2.6863,0.479,0.526,1.0023,0.0003,1.6836,3.3517,0.2735,0.2546,3.7288,0.6353,3.4872,2.6896,0.3545,0.0,2.5517,1.4576,5.007,0.6687,1.6829,2.0878,3.4339,1.9711,1.3551,6.1567,4.1457,4.0182,3.3976,5.4036,8.9014,5.021,6.6877,2.2781,5.0173,4.291,7.772,0.8132,4.0026,5.8697,2.6697,3.8258,8.1632,0.0003,5.6471,1.2567,0.6387,4.1016,6.4171,1.666,0.0096,0.3544,0.4149,3.8173,1.0261,0.7837,1.0461,0.5353,0.7941,2.0231,0.5932,1.2004,6.0899,3.3607,1.584,0.4664,4.0713,1.2732,4.5712,0.5139,5.3514,0.3186,0.3412,5.9032,1.5216,0.7501,2.9647,2.0195,3.1164,0.734,0.3904,0.7186,1.994,5.992,3.9438,0.1544,3.7301,4.8817,8.1074,9.1664,4.4208,2.6625,2.8625,1.2385,3.0762,0.5929,1.9273,2.3945,0.01,6.0404,0.6714,4.8265,1.9162,4.9155,5.0585,0.9453,1.8772,1.8801,1.248,3.1011,1.9869,4.5748,5.2557,2.1323,2.0592,3.0214,3.9977,1.2616,3.6496,6.3279,3.7231,3.2547,0.2238,1.6532,4.7569,5.0782,0.2155,2.204,4.0974,5.954,0.3834,2.2668,1.2095,0.0364,0.0868,0.9146,2.7164,5.0428,4.3916,0.0899,2.5817,3.1946,0.0217,6.1946,2.2861,1.7225,3.37,5.0619,0.9789,1.1744,0.8424,3.9849,7.1514,2.6625,1.7746,4.4623,0.1169,4.6631,0.2835]}

{"id":3398,"ended":false,"length":315,"text":"Shepseskare was a king of Ancient Egypt, the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty. Egypt was unified at the time, with its capital located at Memphis. Shepseskare is the ancestor of King Solomon, the god of Egypt. Shepseskare conquered Rome, Jerusalem, and other cities, and ruled until she died in 703 in Carthage, the largest kingdom of Africa. Shepseskare was buried in Egypt's Grand Cemetery on the outskirts of Alexandria. She has been a significant presence in Egypt, and she holds the title of \"Queen of the Egyptian Empire\" for the fourth time. In 591 she was brought to Egypt by her two daughters. She was then transferred to Egypt by herself, but the Egyptian soldiers had her in her custody. Once in Egypt, she stayed as queen until her death in 703 in Alexandria.\n\nAfter 753, she was transferred to a kingdom in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, also known as the Babylonian King John, the reigning monarch of the kingdom until his death in 1110. After the death of Babylonian King Ibsen in 1116, he was succeeded by His Highness, or Lord of Jerusalem, which he named and instituted for Himself the Kingdom of God. His Highness, or Lord of Jerusalem, presided over this throne. The kingdom went into history in 1122, when Shepseskare founded the Kingdom of Babylon. Shepseskare was crowned with 100 golden coins as the first monarch of Egypt until his death in 1116, almost immediately after His Highness ascended the throne. He was succeeded by His Highness at the time that Shepseskare served the kingdom.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\nShepseskare: The True Story of Egypt\nKing Herod\nEgyptian Antiquities\nEgyptian Antiquities","token_len":378,"entropy":[8.9571,8.7032,8.775,7.3064,4.624,2.7873,8.3045,1.1949,7.9905,1.3369,1.1971,2.9781,5.1006,5.0647,0.3634,4.0872,0.1355,0.6079,7.6284,0.3158,1.465,7.45,1.3329,8.0373,3.6566,0.417,1.0972,2.7121,2.6095,2.6795,2.9865,5.0239,1.7197,6.4378,1.0048,4.8994,0.0304,0.0217,0.041,0.0125,3.6483,2.4592,5.9779,0.0901,3.4698,4.4888,0.7936,1.4416,4.5191,0.1399,4.3113,0.8474,2.0927,0.0096,0.0136,0.0169,0.0093,5.3739,4.7532,1.3802,5.8377,0.3238,0.8628,3.4366,0.9313,2.0561,1.4109,3.0129,3.6366,5.0795,1.7571,0.6998,3.2402,5.0459,5.5439,7.4929,0.001,1.4004,2.8447,4.2365,4.874,1.0668,4.0467,0.3417,1.2386,0.0064,0.0051,0.0105,0.0081,1.2501,3.8261,0.8066,3.8905,2.2093,6.0246,2.9399,2.7264,1.607,3.8982,0.004,1.9937,0.7134,1.8648,8.0253,0.8715,3.4499,5.3568,4.4132,0.459,1.9175,2.9491,1.8195,3.2331,5.4223,0.8735,0.5178,0.0937,1.6458,2.495,0.1838,0.7772,4.1343,2.2318,1.7041,2.9758,1.696,4.0135,0.7176,0.5498,3.6772,3.3806,5.2492,2.2465,1.0152,6.4129,0.3938,1.9102,1.309,1.7807,5.1047,2.1661,2.3245,1.1151,3.0027,4.9161,4.87,0.1422,2.3091,1.6036,7.4717,1.1952,2.8161,3.1431,3.3503,6.7982,3.9635,2.9514,4.0725,4.3332,2.7819,1.3252,6.6108,2.1081,0.2641,0.3865,0.4305,5.444,4.1803,2.8851,1.3721,1.5153,0.7962,0.6046,0.9546,4.5207,3.9236,5.0352,0.3335,1.5579,0.0122,4.6572,4.8249,3.1296,0.7662,1.8583,1.126,3.5102,0.1699,3.372,4.9778,1.6948,1.6178,4.1451,0.007,5.6399,0.9792,6.1812,0.3559,0.0246,1.0022,6.2292,0.242,6.2186,8.7496,2.254,2.6811,6.6606,3.0963,0.211,0.7867,3.5224,4.2008,1.2045,0.2568,0.141,5.9141,4.3758,0.3403,3.0704,1.9324,1.8502,0.0422,7.1607,0.5241,1.1333,6.3445,6.5012,0.2032,2.0222,3.9816,2.2975,0.1232,2.0455,1.5781,2.8421,0.1514,5.6491,0.6135,0.0113,1.1861,6.9418,4.7693,2.578,2.0899,0.6524,4.1773,2.7198,2.051,5.7918,6.0621,4.2443,3.731,3.0407,1.2658,0.0574,2.6587,0.432,3.713,0.6979,0.023,2.0946,0.7555,0.9525,0.3327,0.2486,0.1089,5.5502,0.0481,4.7545,6.1643,2.2154,2.2435,3.0577,6.2731,1.7077,8.5909,1.7809,4.5332,2.4111,0.9371,1.0972,5.3917,0.0157,0.0063,0.0358,0.0082,5.363,0.8718,1.7835,0.0249,3.5488,1.0334,1.1584,0.0103,0.0057,0.0044,0.0058,1.4323,3.9471,2.8099,8.7037,4.9443,3.3463,3.9665,1.6981,1.7955,3.7272,0.5206,2.7596,5.2979,3.0282,0.1399,0.1242,3.5028,1.212,1.765,7.2756,4.3435,0.3726,2.6371,0.2991,0.0011,3.3671,1.7146,0.0304,0.4393,2.971,1.1662,0.7776,0.1292,1.7125,0.0771,0.0135,4.9268,0.5835,3.2249,4.7235,2.3061,0.0014,0.0043,0.0028,0.0053,7.4822,3.8613,3.8071,1.9221,1.2703,0.0002,6.3928,1.1844,0.0004,5.3703,0.8507,22.0146,0.006,0.0148,0.0237,0.0143,3.0491,1.7857,6.1602,1.7016,0.3984,2.5231,2.3113,21.9874,4.1872,3.3239,8.7215,1.3065,3.9335,0.0122,1.4508,9.6144,0.5526,1.6367,0.0017]}
{"id":1826,"ended":true,"length":304,"text":"During its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis ( the process of programmed cell death ).\n\nThe most commonly known mechanism for apoptosis is by a cytokine secretion. The IL-8 response is primarily a response of a small number of genes in the cell, the largest of which plays a role in apoptosis ( see for example (Cobras, A., Anusd. Andros. Andros., 1992, 1831), which consists of a very small subset of IL-8 genes and that play a significant role in survival ( Tumore, S. J., et al., eds., Science, 1992, 2849\u20132845), and in which the IL-8 receptor is not sufficiently protected against its receptor intracellular receptor ( Cuzler, A., et al., 1992, 2687).\n\nAccording to the literature, in many cases the IL-8 receptor is inactivated or damaged through a treatment with a protein that is induced in specific sites of intracellular cell cycle. The cytokines that induce knock-on or activation of IL-8, namely and to a lesser degree anti-inflammatory cytokines, suppress the cytokine release and thus inhibit the IL-8 receptor, e.g. IL-8 Receptor (Tuttle, T., et al., eds., Science, 1992, 2695\u20132698), and therefore increase the level of IL-8. Since IL-8 is also responsible of the activation of the IL-8 receptor, the presence of IL-8-activating protein-sensitized proteins or the ability to express in the cell highly regulated the expression of these proteins, and in many cases the IL-8 receptor had also been found in this cell to function as a regulator.","token_len":378,"entropy":[5.7361,7.2294,0.2657,4.8534,9.7186,5.0617,1.4322,5.2454,1.9377,4.1994,3.3958,2.4119,4.7322,2.7879,1.3577,2.6508,0.0219,4.9743,0.6198,0.2674,2.1204,0.5493,2.559,0.0027,3.79,0.0658,3.0518,9.411,3.6327,1.4036,6.8449,0.1825,0.0582,1.1335,2.0885,0.0009,2.1338,3.9738,3.4819,3.0306,2.442,1.4969,3.2153,0.0094,0.7795,4.0636,3.7693,6.4223,0.0058,6.7819,3.506,2.1563,5.1137,0.0361,2.9363,3.6946,1.2896,5.2237,2.726,2.1874,3.5786,4.3144,4.5718,0.3987,0.0069,4.5049,2.8408,0.4536,2.5438,2.0342,4.2212,6.0781,1.042,0.025,6.7099,0.4779,1.6615,0.059,2.4093,0.039,1.5014,5.0305,5.6197,0.1906,5.9315,6.7133,6.1611,4.188,2.062,5.1794,2.1668,7.4244,5.4156,7.3075,6.9784,7.6689,4.7805,0.8414,5.6372,0.7699,2.0067,4.6709,2.7124,5.7507,5.7123,3.9029,2.9093,5.8485,0.1778,1.9111,6.0612,0.7836,4.2472,0.0346,3.9863,0.0572,1.1691,2.4339,1.8566,5.3662,5.5757,0.6337,2.4919,0.0705,0.0261,6.3186,1.8014,7.1413,5.632,5.8672,0.7978,2.9601,1.4059,3.6471,0.2613,3.4952,0.0016,0.1354,7.8533,0.003,0.3682,5.0324,0.6082,3.9393,0.3804,6.4583,4.616,2.2831,0.2247,6.967,3.7378,1.7887,2.7528,5.914,1.3817,3.3811,0.0576,0.1885,3.2104,0.9733,3.5711,5.7286,5.125,1.4238,4.4655,5.3338,7.9475,0.0674,0.0049,5.6112,1.5725,6.4293,7.089,5.8933,0.2194,2.3139,0.2753,0.8698,0.0013,0.0151,3.5129,0.1222,3.9371,4.5176,1.2862,1.7505,0.0003,5.5334,0.233,1.2209,4.0566,0.4015,4.1195,3.7346,2.1747,2.0439,3.0762,0.0099,0.0582,1.504,0.6796,4.4944,1.0465,3.4255,4.2698,5.139,2.2344,7.5445,1.0829,1.8078,4.7067,2.4106,1.8964,6.2878,2.8552,5.4902,4.2358,1.2666,7.6847,0.004,0.0151,4.2976,8.2412,1.972,2.0001,3.3168,1.7665,1.9494,3.2792,9.3167,2.0852,1.8688,1.8835,5.0083,0.0972,2.1749,0.0044,0.0152,3.5796,5.8403,6.727,7.1873,0.7309,0.1103,1.9284,6.5451,0.0978,1.2021,0.3196,0.0398,0.9331,6.9244,0.9643,3.813,0.217,2.0795,2.364,3.043,3.3117,0.8186,3.2353,0.0156,0.0687,1.8452,2.6801,7.348,0.002,0.0008,1.4216,2.3547,0.0838,2.0412,8.4919,0.1448,2.6526,4.0727,5.3814,2.2303,0.4578,3.3665,0.6262,0.7584,0.0008,0.0113,3.0686,0.0069,0.0494,0.6232,0.0132,0.5711,0.0058,3.0101,3.8853,1.2862,1.2063,1.7595,1.4746,2.1876,6.2059,4.5543,0.4547,3.7752,0.0164,1.3159,0.0053,0.0299,2.6987,5.2061,2.4414,0.0088,0.0108,1.0348,3.9482,4.0233,7.1147,1.0893,3.1361,0.1402,1.2029,1.6593,0.0397,0.3247,0.4364,0.5256,1.7911,4.9618,0.0954,2.2845,0.0038,0.014,3.6407,4.9164,0.1073,3.3632,3.8928,4.9896,0.9998,1.3178,2.4196,3.6562,2.6792,4.6489,1.0171,5.4217,5.2294,1.8679,1.1852,7.3596,4.5538,5.5776,2.2024,0.3074,2.8343,0.5998,2.108,2.5185,3.5147,2.6668,0.2555,1.5265,2.7638,0.0038,0.0085,0.7178,7.5868,4.6841,0.1841,3.6586,2.7788,4.9208,2.313,4.6808,5.5928,0.5865,0.3099,4.3766,3.8274]}
{"id":631,"ended":true,"length":342,"text":"Throughout the regular season, Virginia Tech's offense was led by running back Cyrus Lawrence, who accumulated what was then a school record of 1 @, @ 221 yards during the regular season. Lawrence, who had 1 touchdown and four interceptions in a season-opening home win, led Tech to the No. 1 recruiting class of the 2019 class in recruiting by having the #1 receiver and running back (Jevon Wilkins) ranked No. 1 outside the top 20.\nFrom the start of the season, Lawrence, who had 675 yards rushing, averaged 9.7 yards per catch on 4.9 receiving yards per catch. His performance also contributed to two more touchdown passes against Georgia Tech. One had 25 yards rushing, while the other had 6 yards and 10 yards on the ground. With Lawrence not only leading the way in yards per catch on the season but averaging 10.7 yards per catch while shooting for a career high 19 TDs in his career, it was an indication that the redshirt sophomore was in the correct place to be.\nOn the field, Lawrence also played a crucial role in helping Virginia Tech win the 2020 campaign. Lawrence racked up a league-best seven catches, 534 yards, 13 touchdowns and nine interceptions in the season-opener, which ended up making him just the second Virginia Tech athlete to earn a 2020 All-America vote.\n\"I think that [Heck] you take a back court player to a back court player.

{"id":1521,"ended":true,"length":357,"text":"This was the first hurricane to cause significant disruption to oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico. Several hundred active wells went out of service, and drilling came to a halt for a period of time, as the new oil output allowed production to grow much faster than prior models, including a large rise in U.S. crude prices.\nSome analysts predicted up to eight billion barrels of oil output from the Gulf of Mexico for 2017, compared to the current forecast of about 2.2 bbl for 2017, and several experts predicted that the current levels would remain very high into 2019.\n\"If we continue along this trajectory of lower production due to the high risk factors such as more CO2 in the Gulf, we may see the market decline below the average range and perhaps a more significant drop in output as Hurricane Hurricane Harvey approaches its destination destination in Texas,\" said CMC Markets' head Scott Buss.\nOther analysts also said that they believe more than a dozen wells could go out of service and that any number of new wells could be required to produce about 25 billion barrels of oil per day (boed) that day, with the potential for production to triple or triple that.\nThe first hurricane to strike the U.S. Gulf of Mexico took place in February, which caused much worse havoc in the basin, with some experts estimating that as long as more than a fifth of all crude oil is removed from the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf will drop to a state of emergency and remain one of the world's most dangerous offshore basins.\nThe hurricane was named after Hurricane Gustav, which brought heavy rains to the Gulf and made landfall on the Gulf coast between New Orleans and the Caribbean island of Leeward in early August.\nAt the time of the storm, the United States Coast Guard had warned of high risk of oil spills and storms following hurricanes Harvey and Irma.","token_len":378,"entropy":[4.437,2.0581,2.0075,10.0265,1.174,4.8222,3.5086,5.5612,0.747,7.1472,5.6316,1.4268,0.753,1.181,0.5601,0.0043,1.4812,6.9599,2.8949,8.0798,3.0941,6.2101,3.1133,0.4296,0.8089,2.1152,1.2746,6.0283,7.367,0.6361,0.6377,0.7727,3.8242,2.7269,3.703,0.1469,1.5353,2.1336,3.2478,1.9216,6.3194,2.4766,6.2017,7.0299,4.2479,0.1643,3.0944,4.5658,0.3219,1.875,6.286,6.1825,3.022,5.6545,2.9048,4.6782,4.6952,0.1218,5.0845,0.0049,0.0022,0.0245,1.9844,1.9614,0.4506,0.7025,17.516,2.0315,3.5863,7.7731,0.0054,5.2479,4.4727,0.0781,0.1744,0.6487,8.9983,2.9207,0.9047,1.4878,0.8689,0.0059,5.9892,2.4398,0.9259,4.1055,1.0926,1.2451,2.2086,2.2415,0.2707,2.5086,3.5384,0.5987,2.558,8.0465,0.5182,3.6833,1.7202,1.7275,2.0827,5.5068,3.8504,2.1558,1.7839,1.7011,3.7934,5.5602,2.6968,3.2595,5.0188,1.1445,5.9227,5.0723,0.3974,0.5631,2.007,3.5519,1.7214,2.1487,6.4609,1.1624,1.509,2.4812,5.6239,2.959,6.4218,0.0105,1.9071,4.1342,5.6237,4.3791,4.9543,0.0082,5.4467,8.1493,0.4415,2.122,0.1084,1.6947,0.9612,1.4786,2.1426,1.2029,2.8557,6.5563,3.4312,6.9644,1.7407,5.5864,6.1938,3.546,4.7373,3.4333,4.6609,3.1961,2.0612,0.2542,3.5227,3.2935,7.9526,7.284,1.8083,2.9139,4.5359,3.1806,7.254,2.0387,1.2047,0.5942,0.5814,5.8618,6.5621,4.9406,3.6674,6.3918,6.0888,4.7088,5.4751,1.0938,0.3745,5.7778,1.0402,2.667,2.4192,1.0299,4.4542,2.8002,5.0766,2.7476,2.2117,2.7838,4.5342,1.8143,2.5425,0.7975,0.0517,0.512,3.4348,1.5274,5.2586,4.1536,0.3521,2.8798,0.618,0.4432,1.4115,3.7735,0.6049,4.205,4.7408,4.9555,1.2242,0.1033,0.1856,0.1844,2.1718,0.7679,4.2582,5.3382,11.0175,1.4158,5.627,4.4338,2.0187,3.3072,1.6735,2.4326,0.7566,4.4548,0.3809,5.7977,2.7355,2.0618,2.3473,3.1909,0.3516,1.9336,4.608,1.8931,0.7997,1.9824,0.5414,2.3996,0.0004,0.0012,0.0846,2.6326,2.4775,0.0049,4.958,0.2359,1.1947,3.7923,1.3267,3.4918,3.1127,4.179,7.9375,5.0219,1.5161,0.6827,7.256,1.5901,2.1697,3.8115,4.346,3.0544,0.6685,2.6832,5.6727,0.0065,3.6529,0.5784,2.3955,4.4991,0.0335,2.1954,4.6787,1.2525,2.1667,5.7564,0.2728,0.2549,0.6714,1.266,0.0068,0.975,1.4788,2.8839,1.5707,7.1033,1.3201,1.799,2.0255,0.0427,3.3697,3.1056,6.1135,5.2093,0.0064,0.0302,2.5859,0.001,0.9558,1.6223,5.8814,3.2947,0.0005,0.3663,0.4377,1.8941,3.2891,2.3254,3.9609,0.7095,2.838,4.7597,0.4082,1.4211,4.72,3.8371,1.6845,1.3027,1.0416,1.9846,3.1578,4.137,0.6129,1.8937,1.5053,2.1022,1.788,5.4207,4.6599,1.0754,0.1071,3.171,3.4104,3.2964,0.0919,8.1363,1.7193,0.0083,3.1163,5.2043,2.4461,0.6671,0.993,5.3114,0.9414,0.363,1.3951,0.7198,0.8382,0.2766,1.4717,3.2492,0.0811,4.9465,0.0008,2.5871,2.772,1.8209,4.8971,2.4415,0.7223,4.6015,1.097,1.8398,6.2409,5.0002,4.5792,1.5762,0.2627,0.0072,0.825]}

Daredevil is also an alternate Batman.\nFor the final issue of Daredevil, the comic shows a black-and-white version of him featuring a few dark-winged characters, but also many of the other Dark Knight villains.\nIt was created at the time that Christopher Nolan (Star Wars) began writing the Marvel comic book series series The Dark Knight and was inspired by the comic book series The Stand: The Dark Knight Returns (1917) and The Stand: The Black Knight Returns (1917).","token_len":378,"entropy":[3.3456,1.2552,6.2953,0.4366,4.9873,2.9802,2.0215,3.1167,0.3258,2.8224,1.4159,5.1159,2.4749,1.6244,0.7978,3.8615,1.3114,4.0241,7.3157,9.9023,4.174,0.9061,3.2451,1.6804,3.636,0.0505,0.2229,1.0766,0.3657,2.9191,3.5626,0.2204,13.5219,1.3227,1.8984,4.3246,1.412,0.479,0.4115,0.0068,4.4774,2.2952,5.8558,1.9094,1.803,1.7914,10.2476,2.1651,0.0025,1.667,2.2951,4.4675,3.9098,4.9697,1.5719,2.1133,2.2923,4.4535,3.3853,1.909,6.271,5.5734,5.6477,2.1813,4.8115,3.4624,0.7499,0.1364,0.5311,1.7045,1.9405,2.0362,0.2073,1.245,5.4412,0.1064,5.8989,0.2681,2.7574,5.431,2.4518,0.0543,5.0165,1.6884,0.0,0.376,0.9304,5.835,3.5002,1.5965,4.0003,0.1202,2.0309,0.9414,1.395,0.4132,5.0048,0.7354,4.7878,4.1556,2.5354,5.1971,1.8186,4.2537,2.8032,6.177,3.8572,3.9027,1.977,4.1283,0.4914,1.1939,5.5502,4.2086,4.1318,2.2593,4.0298,0.8758,5.0429,1.5248,0.0017,0.7105,0.6203,2.2294,1.5804,3.8262,0.0407,3.0393,3.8501,2.3394,4.2891,0.3877,5.7422,5.3108,4.7879,4.3343,0.0631,1.684,2.4022,5.1422,2.3344,2.7875,0.8438,5.9847,0.9676,1.1946,1.0384,4.2862,0.8705,1.1215,0.2764,0.3339,4.1413,1.2626,1.8906,1.0548,0.1697,1.2322,5.8151,4.6599,7.5439,2.0809,1.4138,2.6949,3.7784,0.3213,1.9316,1.7685,4.4541,5.5448,4.0474,4.8464,0.3772,1.7204,4.4816,1.7287,2.8589,2.1275,4.7436,4.4935,0.445,1.3863,3.2392,0.4141,5.2145,1.4227,2.4109,1.9822,0.0007,3.1156,3.3007,2.1937,3.0309,0.7308,0.4174,5.2742,1.8155,4.8113,2.8073,1.2317,0.0026,0.0655,4.7102,5.9102,4.6417,0.7815,1.4204,4.6429,0.071,1.9402,1.6192,6.2296,1.5969,1.5964,1.199,0.0253,3.9148,0.357,0.3065,4.6801,4.1717,1.858,1.0702,3.3237,0.9797,5.0618,0.7117,5.0831,0.2952,1.0325,1.713,4.2411,2.7483,4.6296,0.3439,2.8102,4.3562,3.9247,0.3899,3.6431,0.4618,0.3032,0.4084,0.0146,2.3763,5.7667,6.8138,4.0045,1.6684,1.5638,0.775,4.0848,6.8161,2.7812,4.8244,0.3943,1.6839,0.8065,3.313,0.0156,7.1863,0.111,1.8016,2.5754,1.8771,0.9297,5.4505,5.4269,2.5862,4.6646,1.3129,3.0905,4.2802,5.4215,2.7211,3.179,1.1375,1.9121,3.3645,1.8327,6.3591,2.7395,0.7323,4.8582,1.6035,5.1713,3.3252,0.3701,1.1232,0.4263,1.5497,3.9873,5.3993,1.8911,3.3847,0.2407,0.0414,0.0009,0.0066,1.9337,0.0227,4.2698,8.3011,1.2429,5.3728,4.4949,0.6769,0.6463,0.0185,1.2995,1.4344,2.6944,3.2835,4.7936,2.5424,0.4903,2.8981,2.9567,0.7297,2.6353,1.0294,0.973,4.9045,2.3914,5.2522,5.1845,1.5797,3.8729,2.9773,6.8017,0.843,4.1839,4.886,0.3179,1.0645,4.5815,2.6606,1.4304,5.3537,4.4926,1.7027,0.9058,7.0565,3.1793,0.0621,0.0146,3.2096,3.222,3.5583,0.1299,1.0457,3.0697,1.0878,1.3002,2.1933,8.3184,5.6858,1.6222,1.5428,0.1971,0.573,3.2228,3.5129,6.1157,1.717,1.1227,1.2871,2.9351,0.2882,0.3431,4.9462,1.2592,0.5694,0.1083,0.3367,2.9437,0.4354]}

{"id":2807,"ended":true,"length":354,"text":"Chakotay's backstory was explained during the course of Star Trek : Voyager. He was born in 2329 on a Federation colony near Cardassian space in the demilitarized zone. While young, he quickly became fond of the Klingons. On 23 November 1704, three months after being introduced to Voyager, his father, who is a merchant ship captain, kidnapped him out of the world and placed him in the colony of Naboo. During those months, the three lost their balance and lost the ability to move their ships, and they soon were forced to abandon this plan.\n\nAt one point, Voyager decided and decided not to give him a chance due to the high risk of his death. However, the Klingons had never surrendered but the Federation had taken over and wanted them to give him a chance. With all those years of conflict, Captain Kip has become a hero to a lot of the Klingons. He is also a member of the Klingon Empire, which is in many ways the more benevolent and tolerant nation in Star Trek.\n\nWith its strictest rules, the Federation wanted everyone to be able to use technology to do their job and that is what allowed Voyager and Star Trek to have interesting interactions and to be in the same boat. All the Federation were proud of the Klingon Empire; however, their rule was the one that was most restrictive as it allowed more than one ruler per nation. In addition to this, the Federation made the rule that members who were already members of the Federation were allowed to visit the country they had set aside for use by others, only of the other sovereigns' citizens.\n\nA few years after that, the federation decided to abandon the rule by allowing the Kripal to visit again. However, the Federation decided to give the Federation the option of granting this option to all citizens of the Federation.","token_len":378,"entropy":[6.8439,4.1611,1.2285,4.2536,9.468,3.0287,6.0401,5.2668,1.0428,5.0305,0.0112,6.2084,0.4242,6.2678,3.3584,2.654,2.6301,1.0241,3.7518,0.9586,4.5295,5.4373,1.6418,2.2481,4.787,2.1747,5.3756,5.3032,1.6497,1.084,3.6198,1.2643,11.1497,0.0897,0.0007,0.0549,0.1758,1.6536,4.327,5.2831,0.1507,0.4587,5.7733,1.6272,6.6505,0.0142,1.7083,4.608,0.0025,1.9444,4.7962,4.6511,10.505,5.3953,7.2491,0.1338,5.771,1.9952,0.3863,4.5401,4.3063,0.2687,3.9817,0.7119,4.5433,1.2685,1.4797,4.3682,3.597,1.7919,5.9105,3.9264,1.1649,0.4067,5.3901,1.3993,7.0894,0.0689,1.4422,6.852,1.8755,3.8987,0.101,0.6296,1.7413,4.9218,1.8782,7.0701,0.3111,0.5307,3.8669,6.2646,3.4226,0.1715,3.3682,4.6957,5.995,1.2959,5.9695,0.9743,4.3308,2.6495,2.1797,0.0069,2.708,3.2756,2.128,2.1044,1.4692,3.0555,4.0965,3.8108,2.1473,0.1134,2.5309,6.2314,6.5607,0.6006,1.7819,0.0007,4.2341,3.4675,0.0672,0.5725,5.2754,5.4378,8.1079,3.3581,1.6321,0.0058,3.903,2.199,1.6381,1.8516,4.5783,0.0143,1.2053,5.5088,1.5854,0.6839,2.4593,2.811,0.6699,2.2832,0.0255,2.659,4.3006,0.0037,3.0276,5.7793,5.9899,5.1161,3.4445,2.9187,1.6476,3.203,2.1886,2.6819,6.0891,3.6006,0.7709,3.6554,0.946,0.7712,0.252,0.635,4.6429,4.6745,5.0582,2.8902,0.8954,4.9902,1.0154,4.4345,5.9147,4.7795,4.7881,2.9577,1.5711,3.5079,1.2739,4.4361,2.5554,0.0086,3.6255,2.9873,0.012,1.05,1.5558,1.6638,2.1648,1.408,3.5691,0.0092,0.3587,2.939,3.3974,1.2899,2.0528,1.3104,4.2616,4.5481,0.0455,1.6718,5.5302,4.4323,2.5651,3.7411,4.9305,2.3156,4.062,0.0085,1.219,0.8519,0.0002,5.8142,5.6535,6.5469,6.7155,2.382,1.031,1.5732,1.2285,6.9618,5.405,0.4165,1.3782,2.7467,0.0057,3.8834,4.859,2.9633,4.0325,0.8752,2.3413,2.209,3.1912,1.9359,1.4586,5.4287,2.7745,3.4175,5.1232,0.4434,1.5161,3.6679,7.7747,3.4641,3.0893,3.473,2.5533,3.903,2.3877,1.5206,2.7059,0.8704,5.3949,1.9429,3.0352,5.9909,6.6044,0.2984,4.7332,4.525,0.7731,5.5045,3.284,0.0537,3.5086,3.6351,1.3579,4.3588,2.6947,0.7632,2.654,2.1694,2.6917,5.2207,1.4069,2.777,5.0376,1.6783,0.5193,8.2979,3.8408,3.1099,0.9562,3.1832,2.5573,1.5856,2.4658,0.2302,1.1326,0.611,4.9888,2.7627,3.7336,0.9907,6.3745,4.6997,1.8172,5.0114,3.6162,0.1794,0.67,0.9611,1.6498,2.2346,0.2,6.0084,1.5336,5.6423,2.9705,2.6548,5.87,2.1292,0.921,3.8389,1.5249,3.4746,1.9395,5.4485,6.5152,1.9845,4.0868,5.5268,0.4695,5.6901,2.2042,0.5525,1.3567,0.0002,4.2017,2.3797,1.0043,1.4005,3.6673,0.3458,1.5707,5.6901,2.5105,0.4358,5.9386,0.7685,0.6189,3.8837,2.6674,1.8553,5.4574,6.6784,0.9691,2.0452,3.4165,6.2113,0.9525,2.2799,0.0258,1.8251,1.8011,3.5516,0.7836,3.0091,1.3807,2.6108,2.0553,2.6899,0.9477,4.5603,4.6347,1.9158,1.5625,2.0993,3.0336,1.4268,0.6189,0.8762,1.366]}

However, if you had to pick one aircraft that had had the best pilot and seat quality in the world, it was not Airbus.\n\nSince the Airbus has become a leading jetliner in recent years, many questions have arisen about the future of the A320, which is currently suffering from the worst operating condition that any plane in existence has ever faced.\n\nOn April 13, the airline unveiled a detailed plan to address that issue, with a potential resolution plan for the airline in February 2016.\n\nAs usual, Airbus has always been pretty straightforward with the airlines, as long as they provide the flight entertainment feature.\n\nHowever, while Airbus will not release details of the A320 in their planned flight entertainment screens until it has been confirmed that the aircraft will not be sitting idle as of this date, Airbus said they will \u201ccontinue working with Airbus to obtain the required approvals to use the A320B\" to continue operating on the Airbus aircraft.\n\nAs we reported earlier in the day, the A320 will operate exclusively between Paris and Brest, with the A380 in service between Brussels and London.\n\nIt is currently being leased by Airbus Airlines.","token_len":378,"entropy":[4.0072,4.1431,2.6722,0.0951,6.4816,5.9994,1.9756,2.3323,12.452,0.6142,0.7212,11.2906,7.7541,9.5584,5.6699,7.7361,9.4967,0.2899,0.994,6.8983,9.776,4.8468,1.0574,6.7191,8.779,5.7417,6.1674,3.7634,4.3458,7.3706,8.2039,8.4171,1.2093,0.7073,9.8663,9.2821,2.4451,6.7236,5.1587,1.2733,4.6277,4.3958,0.7237,0.0216,0.9266,1.0129,1.009,0.6508,1.6431,5.4693,6.9844,4.145,6.0075,6.3176,1.4849,3.5343,4.2099,1.9124,6.0136,2.3443,0.1557,3.9979,3.1751,4.9409,7.5769,6.2172,6.1926,0.0231,2.6704,2.5281,0.0398,0.1428,0.1349,5.3752,5.4004,6.3978,3.8695,4.7863,1.538,2.4956,3.2358,2.2821,7.7897,0.0014,0.3342,0.0013,0.0018,0.0009,4.1857,4.5121,3.5715,4.4304,3.5192,4.1444,4.0785,4.3239,4.0046,4.3413,1.2358,1.8451,5.726,0.2014,3.0543,3.0982,0.1452,2.7607,3.5591,0.0001,0.7061,0.1305,0.0005,5.5529,1.0462,1.5223,0.0003,2.4558,3.1292,0.1158,0.1859,3.6123,1.2552,6.0028,0.3064,1.6217,2.232,5.5353,2.3003,1.6817,1.564,0.6612,1.7031,4.3585,0.7046,0.2315,1.0133,1.9195,0.4879,4.6777,1.892,3.0076,0.0647,4.9971,1.2778,4.7257,1.9312,2.395,0.7937,2.9397,3.297,3.7618,5.0485,1.7182,3.4066,6.3511,5.0865,6.7384,4.9528,2.4232,0.8363,1.068,0.7014,1.7204,2.7127,3.824,3.8373,1.8804,0.6175,0.0002,6.1874,1.2657,3.2644,5.9865,3.7133,1.5487,5.3369,5.1739,0.8302,2.979,4.4306,0.0762,0.1448,3.5136,5.2269,0.7042,1.6046,0.9325,0.966,4.8146,0.1781,0.4473,1.0137,0.0418,2.4321,2.5831,1.6047,2.0782,7.2446,0.4245,2.8251,3.5075,5.9396,2.9659,4.0807,3.2442,3.6486,2.0344,4.3668,1.3872,2.1343,1.9797,0.1691,0.3777,0.0002,4.5216,2.7299,3.612,0.4499,2.0033,3.5679,5.2083,1.0935,5.3833,2.4727,1.0457,2.4192,3.9602,1.7182,1.2662,2.6406,1.9564,5.7656,5.0894,6.5587,2.3821,1.2209,5.0812,2.702,5.0536,3.1296,0.2514,0.6397,0.0002,4.0533,5.5725,0.1259,2.1867,1.6676,4.3001,1.2707,6.1162,4.6777,1.4235,2.6499,5.8578,1.6397,3.2037,3.307,0.0214,0.9366,4.7415,1.5564,5.9894,1.0971,5.2935,1.6545,1.0114,0.0002,1.3801,0.0311,5.0239,3.0072,4.1053,3.262,3.776,2.0415,1.7697,0.9659,3.9056,0.0208,4.3581,5.1516,5.5133,6.1107,3.6385,4.6092,3.6265,3.6933,1.18,2.6892,3.3305,0.6654,1.055,3.3011,1.2522,3.3152,1.2009,6.2091,2.4292,4.7826,3.8708,2.3252,3.4933,0.0973,4.1392,3.6326,2.5744,1.5197,15.7175,8.1852,4.8602,3.8534,1.4714,3.8663,1.3909,7.0694,1.5101,3.1138,3.9605,1.9681,4.4693,0.6201,2.0159,0.0292,6.3138,8.8903,2.91,4.5755,3.6277,3.2936,1.3168,2.7744,3.965,1.1428,0.1795,0.0002,3.3561,3.7,1.554,1.5555,3.2168,0.8854,2.0449,0.0668,1.3297,1.4315,0.0262,2.5211,5.5298,5.8944,5.094,3.8185,0.4718,5.3675,2.374,1.7245,1.9325,1.7617,3.0681,3.6666,3.6617,3.3324,0.4698,3.182,0.1018,3.4017,0.6209,0.521,0.0002,3.8014,1.1442,2.9059,3.1435,4.9582,0.9797,1.496,5.2564,2.6634]}

There was less chance of rain, but because the temperature of the garage was lower, due to the high pressure in the garage, the conditions of the car had to turn slightly cooler. This had to be managed because everything was more stable as on last year. The first car of the race was the Ferrari S1 with a speed of just 19 minutes and a top speed of 30 km\/h (23 miles per hour). Then the conditions changed and that was in the fastest car of the race. The engine started working fast in the first lap but there was no pace. The S1 ended up being the fastest car in first place of the race. Then there was a real race between the two teams, which could not contain the pace; however the car managed to get to 27 km\/h (22 miles per hour) in 2 2.3 seconds.\n\nAfter the race the conditions of the races were much more like this : rain, temperatures and humidity of the cars.

The governor of Veracruz issued the alerts in response because the state is in danger. The Governor asked the people of the state to be at their safest possible location \u2014 at their convenience.\n\n\u201cWe strongly advise that all of our residents should be at their safest possible location,\u201d President Donald Trump said in a statement that was released on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe want you to know that we do not have any plans to suspend, or cancel, our travel to, from and to the United States.

{"id":2032,"ended":true,"length":356,"text":"At the beginning of November, President Johnson announced that a bombing had been halted in Vietnam ; observers noted that the development significantly helped Humphrey although Nixon had endorsed such talks. At this time the United States was preparing to launch a punitive air raid on the Vietnamese air base, the US had warned that it would retaliate while a small number of civilians were being killed, the Soviet Union had warned of the presence of Russian air-raid sirens and the threat was intensified. The US military operations had stopped for a while and the fighting had moved to the countryside. During these months the Russian government held a number and coordinated operations in coordination with the French and Polish troops and held two more large air raids on the Vietnamese airfields on November 17th. This had resulted in the death and destruction of several US tanks, tanks and fighter jets. The air raid on the airfields proved to be disastrous for the US forces as a consequence of the bombing.\n\nOn November 20th at 10:30 a.m. President Johnson ordered that the US use all its resources and all its available resources against the insurgents and the militants in southern Vietnam. The Russian army commanded by General Sergei Lavrov had begun to take heavy casualties. The French air force had also been destroyed in the operation, as was the French air force. The French air force had managed to capture half of the Vietnamese airfields and had also been destroyed. In total 17 French air defences destroyed 25 airfields. The Russian military operation was stopped on November 20th because the Russian airforce had withdrawn from the area, but also because of the difficulty in securing information on the location of the airfield. It could not immediately be determined who had attacked the airfield since the US had not been able to search the airfield since January, and the British forces had left on horseback only after the first few minutes of the operation had been completed.","token_len":379,"entropy":[2.5476,3.5747,0.5364,5.162,0.3958,5.1092,7.5097,3.219,0.9586,3.85,8.1096,4.2302,0.5912,7.7522,1.1082,6.3475,10.9831,9.803,3.657,0.381,1.2459,8.3628,9.0623,5.9568,10.257,0.0328,10.828,5.5606,1.3887,7.8214,4.0711,7.9262,0.7142,4.251,3.5908,0.8652,2.2868,2.6654,0.1119,1.4136,3.9385,0.7829,2.7746,0.9439,7.14,3.1513,3.3184,1.0846,2.0891,3.395,4.1378,2.3791,1.8082,3.0873,7.0917,5.9341,4.9626,2.0189,1.6295,0.7052,3.9561,7.9101,4.5241,5.0727,1.3562,0.0333,3.8161,0.8321,1.7174,2.4364,2.3396,3.5698,6.087,0.5826,0.8943,2.8812,1.6372,2.3677,4.9422,0.0186,4.4825,3.6491,3.4923,4.5749,4.6513,0.7373,1.5673,1.9452,4.0396,5.2202,6.8988,0.864,1.8673,3.2169,3.0489,6.2882,2.9978,5.9419,3.2587,1.5897,2.2442,1.5427,1.4405,6.0247,1.7348,3.9199,1.3507,1.1377,4.8435,1.1554,4.4658,4.1472,3.0493,1.3671,5.708,3.842,5.7797,1.7411,3.4586,9.1052,5.649,3.7327,1.9807,6.7774,0.0331,0.4691,4.998,1.4646,7.2298,4.4138,3.0314,6.9599,5.2093,4.4491,3.5416,1.8773,1.0195,1.2088,0.9314,2.0623,1.883,4.1134,2.9699,1.3643,3.7006,2.472,0.6492,3.559,4.9418,3.2563,0.0069,0.9527,3.0681,3.2247,1.0177,0.0142,3.9693,4.0907,5.4299,1.5044,4.1896,1.0739,4.4425,2.7841,0.6912,1.6025,4.1443,0.9575,2.1557,0.7819,2.7482,2.2339,4.9633,0.7822,0.0793,5.0373,0.963,0.4652,2.7183,2.859,3.6239,3.9891,4.153,0.133,0.7969,3.6439,1.3785,3.356,0.0173,2.1736,0.8398,2.2742,0.0646,4.8318,2.6824,0.4974,1.8849,1.0152,0.2059,0.0229,0.5365,3.9267,0.3752,1.9451,2.3675,1.0622,2.64,6.0912,1.5056,3.54,4.2279,2.3219,3.4541,3.1078,2.8298,3.0114,2.429,0.5772,5.4461,2.2838,2.4574,7.247,1.9675,4.5981,0.7241,0.4425,1.4569,6.3183,3.3182,7.6885,2.3358,0.7805,4.7877,7.0501,1.5297,4.4556,1.7414,4.0483,4.6849,1.5959,1.9676,1.6003,4.5279,3.4486,0.6182,1.2497,2.6011,1.2234,4.0034,2.7383,0.88,4.4619,2.3189,3.2687,2.593,0.5229,2.7411,2.2447,0.3198,1.6459,1.376,2.6842,1.937,0.2039,1.0152,5.2738,0.0435,3.1895,5.4166,0.356,0.3569,2.5225,1.4512,1.0334,1.5258,1.8893,2.9533,2.9205,2.4478,1.3044,3.0427,3.6939,6.597,3.5534,2.4644,6.8463,5.568,7.2057,2.6132,0.5695,1.4207,1.3759,2.9183,3.3832,4.3205,1.6158,5.4505,2.3974,0.4921,1.6432,0.1926,4.728,1.972,2.8962,1.9977,4.5026,0.8335,5.8944,1.2248,0.9142,1.795,2.8147,2.3309,4.4072,0.1543,1.1928,0.7415,6.2291,1.37,3.3663,6.6367,1.8118,0.3939,1.5779,0.1561,0.5219,1.9985,1.2479,0.6705,3.8324,4.6376,0.5357,5.0659,0.8629,1.4746,3.6923,1.2494,4.7027,0.6282,0.525,0.4043,5.5853,1.2027,3.773,1.259,1.5418,1.9384,0.5636,0.0064,6.28,1.7744,2.4273,0.1843,3.1636,3.9864,3.1703,1.788,1.6171,5.1822,4.8684,0.8515,5.4686,3.6988,8.9916,0.002,5.2489,2.0356,1.3464,4.7445,4.9174,4.2085,0.6517,0.6713,1.1638,1.9473,1.5204,1.4238,0.1227]}
{"id":4312,"ended":true,"length":346,"text":"By 1300, Southampton was a major port and a large provincial town, with a population of around 5 @, @ 000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in the 1250s, with new buildings built. The first commercial settlement was established in the town, and eventually the community, which is a small settlement off of St. Mary, was settled in 1499, by an act of Parliament which allowed those persons living at the time to be transferred to the colony.\nIn 1601, settlers moved from Southampton to St. Mary. It is said that the settlement was built and established by 1630, and that by 1630, only two years old, the area had attained a population of about 100, that was about the average of the entire state of Southampton. In 1714, the town was occupied by the King Edward IV and his family \u2014 the sons of Sir Isaac Stuart, Duke of Wessex.\nIn 1772, the settlers were moved to England by the Treaty of Bridgeton, which ended British rule in England in 1774. They settled in Manchester, and in 1773, the settlement was moved again to Southampton, and in 1785, it was founded. By 1850, Southampton was occupied by the English Commonwealth\nby the French Empire; however, in 1847, the settlement was taken over as part of the British Expeditionary Force\u2014the first British-owned occupation in South Africa.\nAfter South Africa fell in the Civil War of 1861, the settlement was taken over by the French, who moved to the north of the island in 1851. The location was settled on the North Shore of the Cape, between Cape Town and the nearby village of Leitrim. In 1858, the settlement was taken over as part of British forces\nby the American forces, and by 1869, it was occupied by the French.","token_len":379,"entropy":[12.3174,1.2028,10.6556,2.9656,2.6997,3.4961,4.5724,2.6099,2.6533,4.6403,9.4523,2.3576,1.6118,1.9333,1.5755,0.7125,0.1065,2.8295,3.5366,15.0571,6.9165,7.0592,9.0872,1.0778,2.0883,12.6563,0.2007,5.4253,3.8347,9.0036,9.7828,7.9163,5.1994,7.0699,0.6268,1.7104,4.4397,3.4944,0.6183,1.1444,2.3096,5.1922,2.4188,2.7803,3.0967,1.8378,3.102,4.6306,4.9907,1.0715,3.8707,0.6463,2.0936,2.7361,3.4275,2.2271,5.3284,2.2773,4.9522,4.8325,2.0426,3.5344,4.9317,2.8884,4.6147,5.8647,2.4129,3.5679,1.4919,2.6404,3.7055,0.7832,4.0456,1.8938,2.8643,4.767,2.2083,3.2829,4.0914,5.0831,0.1875,1.1461,3.0295,3.0002,5.7677,5.8803,2.747,2.9785,1.1745,1.7063,0.4247,3.0621,6.2525,0.5385,1.6014,4.7301,0.8082,1.6365,6.0028,2.5134,3.2116,0.3731,7.1078,3.3896,2.4677,1.9929,0.2687,3.1117,0.1669,1.1001,2.1436,3.7836,1.5665,2.1228,0.2426,1.6933,3.3523,1.2236,3.2723,3.8475,4.2066,1.4052,5.5911,4.0003,0.8152,1.3042,1.3347,3.3181,0.8073,3.2929,1.3417,5.3634,3.6063,2.9829,5.2731,0.2302,1.2119,5.1595,2.1452,6.4161,1.5853,0.6505,0.0741,2.1131,3.9838,0.514,7.4555,1.6129,3.2515,2.7032,4.6811,0.8444,1.3518,4.0034,4.7665,1.092,2.1253,0.8017,2.4913,2.1139,3.6242,0.2191,1.2088,2.2274,0.7713,4.8768,0.1546,1.0037,4.7886,4.2212,4.0833,3.3767,1.8559,1.8471,7.2615,1.9953,6.5059,0.4396,4.0911,4.2294,5.4252,0.9129,3.2922,0.0437,5.4091,0.0004,1.7085,1.669,1.4232,0.5489,6.797,0.109,1.1247,4.9141,2.5238,3.4239,0.6274,6.2797,1.9166,1.2814,4.124,0.0281,6.6573,3.5434,0.8336,0.7032,0.9838,3.9199,5.7883,0.7467,0.9233,2.4994,3.0071,0.5208,2.791,0.3791,3.4862,2.2375,1.0873,6.0391,0.8371,1.9784,1.9599,0.632,3.6348,0.8024,1.7898,3.0749,0.5863,3.4285,3.624,0.5105,2.6687,1.4327,1.7889,1.4829,0.6065,3.4945,0.4634,1.9739,0.3435,5.1082,2.039,3.4454,4.5974,0.1121,3.2437,0.8122,4.8222,0.0837,0.6934,3.1639,5.5513,8.2144,5.4346,0.9128,3.9539,3.5782,4.0477,4.5773,0.0374,2.0514,0.709,5.1858,0.2779,0.9434,2.5081,0.3286,3.8415,0.5892,5.9041,1.4285,0.0013,0.5502,1.5879,6.8459,2.2782,0.4483,6.9475,1.7344,1.89,1.5284,4.4347,3.2777,6.472,1.3426,3.9899,1.4553,0.629,1.1258,4.138,6.0174,0.0854,4.4822,2.7161,2.4025,4.5535,0.0205,2.0818,2.3597,0.8906,0.8358,2.1232,0.7787,3.0116,0.122,0.5671,0.3383,1.8092,2.4533,1.235,3.7655,1.4296,1.378,4.1863,1.4378,0.482,3.6952,1.8927,0.9904,4.0509,0.5442,1.8007,6.2236,2.5067,4.7584,3.0852,0.7832,5.2351,2.3988,0.782,1.2969,1.8653,1.4645,4.8661,2.6196,2.389,0.1244,2.0716,6.8794,4.7419,0.064,5.4006,4.9236,0.6001,0.9053,2.0304,0.7875,3.194,0.0955,0.7269,1.6602,0.281,2.7233,0.0835,1.8563,0.3865,0.0009,4.2231,4.3576,6.7798,1.7914,0.3031,4.5519,3.5093,1.3942,1.7235,2.5905,1.8656,2.6729,0.4004,1.5513,0.2586,2.7044,0.1916,0.2076,2.2354,1.1183]}

{"id":391,"ended":false,"length":347,"text":"There have been many radio versions of the play. In 1925 the BBC broadcast an adaptation with Hesketh Pearson as Jack Worthing. Further broadcasts of the play followed in 1927 and 1936.\n\nThe play received a new name in 1933, after a series of musicals, based mainly on characters by the same name. Many of these characters had been played by other playwrights as well. It was broadcasted in the UK in September 1934; the UK version was not broadcast until the 1940s.\n\nIn 1937, there was a new play set in a castle in North Shields, where the children of Henry and Grace have been engaged by a young playwright called John. John's son had left the village after his father's death but had joined in with them. In 1938, as Henry's home was damaged by an accident, one of his daughters was killed at a school function. The play was a success and was revived in the UK in 1947.\n\nIn 1962 John is the last surviving child of Mrs John Parker and Sir John Oats, a noted stage actor. John also has his name engraved on a number of objects in the South Downs, including a postcard of his wife.\n\nIn 1985, Sir John was convicted of murder in connection with the disappearance and theft of a car. He is the only surviving actor in town.\n\nIn 1985, an artist was convicted of vandalism and vandalism at a house in the Old Town, Newham.

{"id":3982,"ended":false,"length":317,"text":"The genus Sarcoramphus, which today contains only the king vulture, had a wider distribution in the past. The Kern vulture ( Sarcoramphus < unk > ), lived in southwestern North America, and was the largest surviving species of vulture (Bridgeworth & Tull, 1975), with a considerable amount of head. Today it was probably kept in captivity, and died in an environment of loss. A number of individuals had grown to the size of the Kern vulture, and the population continued to grow, eventually contributing approximately $2 million to this large group. At the height of the population, and as of 2019, there were approximately 20,000 Kern vulture.\n\nDescription\n\nKern vulture is the largest of the kern vulture species endemic to the US. The bony male may reach a height of approximately\u00a01 m, with a body length of  with an outer shell of  long. The menses are  long and  in length. The stinger is  in length, and is  deep. It is characterized by a smooth, flexible upper wing and a dark, white, long wing. The upper wing has a broad upper margin of  and a deep, slender tail. Both long and short wings, as described earlier, are black. The wings are thick, with a deep, dark surface.\n\nIn addition to the kern vulture species, there are other sargons, such as the jasper vulture and the gopher vulture of Kentucky. Sargons are the most common sparrow species. They typically prefer light brown to plumage on the upper and lower wing (pink) and have a long wingspan near. The species are also found by the bony male and females.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nkern vulture","token_len":379,"entropy":[11.4236,5.2043,3.8613,8.8164,8.5908,4.9557,1.9482,1.5004,7.8476,4.0195,3.4912,3.6248,7.761,8.8673,2.016,1.0271,4.5976,1.8749,6.7782,1.4822,1.4604,1.3464,4.581,1.8776,1.9967,13.2488,6.6485,0.2938,2.8133,8.0624,0.4825,0.2732,0.7002,0.0953,9.0977,9.6746,6.2902,7.4012,4.0311,8.7089,0.7201,4.9652,3.2811,0.1367,1.8583,1.5498,1.5253,2.6536,1.979,5.37,2.1714,0.969,2.6049,0.075,3.3412,5.427,5.7423,2.8948,1.8137,4.4646,5.6162,3.8529,2.3334,4.0799,2.97,2.1732,1.145,7.8621,4.5414,0.0165,5.7772,3.7998,5.2051,3.3135,4.7472,4.1103,7.4084,0.8779,3.6731,1.7526,2.0291,6.3995,2.3196,4.5372,4.9053,2.0431,7.6559,1.6872,4.1983,2.9519,0.0044,5.5251,3.423,6.6583,1.4233,3.36,0.6677,0.0365,3.6131,5.0432,0.3008,0.062,0.9947,1.2244,2.4252,4.5658,4.3948,0.0983,1.041,2.288,3.2999,6.9958,4.9306,4.4194,3.2162,0.9719,0.965,5.0465,5.3313,3.4023,0.824,4.9697,1.0265,4.9405,0.012,0.5348,4.2648,0.886,5.8754,3.4967,3.6925,8.2565,0.1776,1.7275,0.8756,2.0405,4.0218,1.0481,0.0959,3.9256,0.0485,1.8641,2.5221,1.459,0.0013,6.5312,0.9169,0.0002,3.6086,0.0224,0.2354,0.4892,1.9201,2.4175,1.3561,2.7018,0.5851,6.3228,1.9452,1.8873,0.3197,2.6151,6.6735,0.2545,1.4356,4.8128,1.1592,1.6422,6.1112,1.8178,7.1653,6.2626,3.3889,2.8196,0.9029,0.0683,2.7635,11.126,3.4014,3.4174,1.7641,2.2155,0.8745,2.0816,0.5219,0.1893,5.5713,17.4986,2.3649,7.5498,3.8808,1.6944,3.5869,7.3283,3.775,0.957,5.1959,5.112,1.1646,5.0575,6.8805,1.209,2.105,6.6454,5.2214,1.5955,0.7427,6.2139,3.4827,1.3161,1.0904,5.4831,1.3079,1.735,1.4225,2.0672,2.3421,5.031,2.1072,3.376,1.1667,5.1463,0.0655,1.2638,5.0336,1.3181,5.4349,4.9291,6.1135,2.2855,1.4245,4.6889,1.3376,3.7275,1.8369,4.3419,3.6962,1.1144,0.7455,3.8689,2.0937,2.2955,0.7867,4.3687,5.1439,3.496,3.3884,0.4838,2.2861,1.3297,4.0573,1.0483,5.5932,3.6558,0.6274,5.2436,6.6614,0.3407,0.7758,1.8338,4.0701,3.9175,5.4096,3.3624,0.1661,0.8743,5.1837,1.228,0.7146,3.184,0.6839,5.2413,1.3657,2.0657,1.2431,4.1652,0.886,3.0475,5.3335,1.114,3.2724,0.0015,3.7056,3.5217,0.2816,1.0393,3.7454,0.0116,0.0702,0.0257,3.8489,0.4934,1.5902,0.2874,2.6849,5.3069,4.9583,5.8405,1.7208,2.8948,0.0031,0.9105,5.1628,4.2739,1.14,0.0421,2.4016,0.6635,4.8235,2.6066,0.1241,0.0069,5.4908,6.23,0.7545,4.1066,0.07,0.0949,0.9626,3.1367,1.8105,0.6615,7.5142,2.0481,1.3527,2.7587,1.8909,5.5873,6.714,5.8352,4.1244,0.9628,7.5613,0.124,5.363,1.5664,3.7894,2.8439,0.31,3.5609,5.0263,6.1045,2.6623,2.5888,0.9724,2.7181,0.9972,2.6321,5.4496,0.1144,8.5551,8.1194,1.7105,4.937,2.8757,2.8568,2.4879,7.0624,2.623,4.8886,1.1443,2.0326,2.2809,2.9887,1.6515,1.6404,0.0003,4.774,0.4293,0.0005,8.7173,1.5561,0.6847,0.0003,7.3976,0.0608,0.628,0.0288]}
{"id":3477,"ended":true,"length":344,"text":"Unlike undergrad admissions, there is no single admission process for graduate students. Each institution inside Unicamp has its own set of procedures, which usually include an admissions exam which can be specific in the final stage of eligibility. The process of determining if a graduate can apply to Unicamp has become pretty straightforward, usually requiring a number of factors, such as time frame, budget, and applicant needs. However, there are also some more important factors such as the length of tuition and fees, admission requirements, and other considerations involved in determining whether or not a student is best placed to achieve UCF\u2019s admission benchmarks. In terms of applications, both UCF and Unisty offers only one type of application process: Academic Enrichment Application \u2013 The application process for UCF\u2019s incoming graduate students begins in November 2011. This process is different from the others, as it involves an admission application process involving a set of admissions criteria. This process also applies to applicants in many states, including the U.S. Senate and the US Congress, which may include any state. The application process also includes an approval process that should be performed in a manner where the applicant or applicant\u2019s school, community and work history are evaluated. At UCF, applicants are also considered for admissions and will be considered for UCF admission, but do not currently have to take more than three rounds of test. In addition to this admission process, unisty offers another major application process that might present a more difficult choice: Application of Academic Enrichment Information System (AIEIS) application. These AIEIS applications typically allow the applicant to complete both admission-level and entrance-level requirements by filling out the application form and applying again at the end of the year. In contrast to the AIEIS process, unisty also requires applicants to complete a two-year entrance exam.","token_len":379,"entropy":[12.801,10.2064,1.5242,3.2836,1.702,1.9332,4.5092,5.7198,2.9226,1.8793,4.8637,0.3506,0.7672,4.0666,3.7375,12.0344,13.0212,7.3522,1.6061,0.9965,0.0392,3.3806,0.0427,4.7295,2.1862,1.9864,5.559,2.5338,2.9096,2.7287,5.2744,5.5581,2.9737,0.6275,8.2887,5.1902,2.3697,5.9136,5.5161,0.5276,5.4621,0.6404,2.5375,2.5077,2.771,3.6026,3.6128,1.2111,1.4439,3.8907,2.2082,1.7946,6.0017,0.0085,3.6325,3.2828,6.2239,4.1374,2.1848,6.3736,3.2694,1.4073,4.4705,0.0096,3.1378,1.4087,1.6956,0.0018,6.4071,4.7472,0.4942,5.7845,0.4571,1.0631,5.7049,5.2316,0.3161,3.6941,0.0294,1.7978,0.4144,1.9275,2.0543,4.2503,3.8951,1.1373,2.7301,0.0011,1.8393,2.8572,0.1096,7.7498,1.4168,2.7964,0.9681,7.638,1.316,0.3741,0.5612,2.8916,3.0541,5.3448,1.1031,3.0365,1.679,1.7776,0.0054,0.6839,1.9762,1.5796,8.9176,3.0994,0.5023,5.2281,7.8283,2.7502,13.8077,7.6468,3.086,5.1204,6.9584,0.1762,3.4978,5.3596,0.0006,5.3158,0.4166,5.497,2.8574,0.0359,0.1972,7.3815,4.3841,2.9125,5.3934,6.7272,2.582,3.3693,0.0449,2.1193,2.8791,1.9929,5.8773,4.7722,7.0336,0.0093,2.7258,6.0804,3.6508,2.1679,0.5084,1.4676,2.0335,0.0129,5.3244,0.0138,0.0318,3.9938,3.1592,0.3933,2.697,1.8812,3.7298,4.2623,0.6962,2.5586,1.3765,1.1422,4.3862,0.4365,1.1088,4.9637,1.2464,2.5086,1.5638,1.9693,2.8296,4.0052,3.7055,2.1874,5.249,1.4575,5.0359,0.3439,3.0115,1.0675,1.4016,3.0128,1.0299,3.3912,4.9265,0.1966,3.3295,3.6485,4.8108,4.6907,1.1589,1.1273,2.8177,1.5693,0.0296,0.0088,0.3243,7.3095,1.6568,1.0234,5.2665,2.5408,1.4944,2.8767,3.5039,3.8727,4.8858,2.2972,3.8705,1.9047,2.2606,0.2512,2.8198,1.0743,2.3746,6.575,0.3029,2.5579,5.3877,0.5874,4.9639,2.1718,2.2966,4.1015,6.2724,1.3088,0.6867,5.7582,1.6168,14.1226,0.3802,0.0083,4.7334,3.1385,2.899,2.9348,7.2767,6.2816,1.2004,3.8618,1.065,5.2214,1.2036,0.0113,0.3044,2.7933,1.4225,3.3589,4.1036,1.0347,4.8244,2.9648,3.4955,0.7576,2.2341,0.6383,3.6156,0.045,3.4756,3.6195,3.0624,5.5965,0.0437,5.8077,0.9965,0.9958,3.6013,6.7719,0.1443,2.6426,5.0098,0.124,5.3821,2.4679,2.8043,0.7711,0.9083,3.3272,4.939,0.189,0.0724,6.9143,0.9703,0.0058,1.079,4.3834,5.2907,3.4566,0.1373,2.1375,6.085,5.5223,1.8883,3.5806,1.8023,3.4883,2.6803,3.7172,2.9941,4.4269,0.4171,0.0054,0.0101,7.6805,4.13,1.1063,0.5827,5.6822,0.8163,0.6008,4.5302,0.6386,3.8739,10.8865,6.4943,0.0023,0.6197,4.4529,5.2849,2.5202,0.8305,0.2883,3.7361,4.7753,6.3084,5.5684,2.7482,0.5996,5.9431,0.276,0.0139,2.7637,4.5108,4.6549,0.1935,2.1931,2.0001,1.0262,1.2962,4.345,6.9094,2.4457,1.1442,0.8041,0.1404,0.3443,1.8361,0.147,2.6303,4.573,1.0139,1.195,4.5064,0.0097,0.0014,0.5604,0.1721,4.8368,0.0077,0.0008,2.7591,2.8329,1.6417,0.1397,1.7485,1.6248,4.4552,0.1094,1.107,6.713,1.7338,2.0484]}
{"id":4714,"ended":true,"length":326,"text":"As far back as the Iron Age, Welsh folk were using wild cereals to create a coarse bread. By the time the Romans invaded, Celtic skills with bread had progressed to the present day \u2013 and the early Neolithic period.\n\nThe Welsh people who produced the modern Irish bread were known as \u2018Bethannagh\u2019 (or \u2018Ardean\u2019) and were considered a Christian community. Although this term can be used to describe many cultures, the Celtic community are far less involved in traditional Irish bread making than the Old Ageolithic. The term \u2018Bethannagh\u2019 was coined in 1670 because Bethannagh is considered to have been the earliest of the Catholic Church\u2019s four religions.\n\nBethannagh is often described as the home to four people, a town of three people, and three houses \u2014 known as the Barrow and Piazzas. The ancient Irish bread used to be made from an enormous wooden cylinder and had to be cut or cut into pieces to create a large batter.\n\nThe Welsh also had an important role in shaping the Anglo-Saxon Empire. British monarchies were frequently called \u2018Bethannagh\u2019s\u2019\u2019 by British scholars and the early writers; however, this is only the third recorded instance of a Welsh King having influence over his home community, after the Norman Conquest and the Tudor Years.\n\nIn medieval times Bethannagh was a major centre of commerce for Northern Ireland and it was also one of the major centres of trade for most of the medieval period. The early Irish writers of both the early and medieval medieval eras used large volumes of Welsh literature to describe these early times and present times. The early medieval and mid- Medieval periods included much of the English \u2018English and Welsh\u2019 literary works so many years later.","token_len":379,"entropy":[6.6895,3.939,0.519,2.0048,8.8981,1.3232,0.3238,8.0474,3.9842,2.3593,6.0824,6.0962,9.2719,0.0088,1.969,3.5879,2.7364,9.3182,4.8699,1.3063,4.3709,0.4116,1.238,1.3996,2.6042,2.7589,1.8007,5.5571,9.3913,5.6207,4.0927,2.2606,4.4685,1.2428,0.9547,5.6585,0.2806,4.8515,2.3454,2.2466,5.3612,6.6546,0.0122,3.2247,3.1121,0.9175,0.0007,2.1657,4.3508,2.9523,4.3928,5.3588,1.077,4.3765,4.9987,1.9557,1.6501,3.844,0.4301,11.7973,6.5982,5.9927,6.0713,5.6586,4.9973,5.6813,7.0016,2.4589,3.5667,2.4132,0.3201,5.6693,3.9538,2.616,1.0374,0.2502,1.8157,1.6199,2.145,3.309,2.6287,7.036,2.7551,0.8309,4.1502,3.4718,3.645,4.2033,0.6975,1.4463,1.0862,0.9068,3.369,4.0078,0.8083,1.8787,3.8331,2.5213,5.5537,6.1893,2.917,4.634,0.6366,3.6644,1.7727,1.4896,2.3511,1.0573,1.3176,6.338,5.4647,11.3369,2.4425,2.5267,4.3221,1.6742,0.0691,0.9016,0.2421,0.058,0.1343,0.6903,0.0355,1.6252,1.6783,1.2635,3.2364,4.4346,5.5898,6.5692,0.1844,0.5134,1.972,3.752,1.0962,1.3786,0.4187,0.8831,2.3369,3.429,0.7739,6.8275,2.4024,9.1894,0.5858,7.2464,7.1915,8.4118,0.4823,0.7886,0.0002,3.1896,0.1677,0.0103,0.0975,1.571,3.7426,3.3535,0.1609,1.5559,4.6247,3.7702,6.0791,5.4161,1.934,3.6817,6.294,1.7926,3.3228,2.1407,1.1487,1.4789,2.689,3.5485,6.954,6.426,0.2793,1.5846,6.0402,1.685,2.949,5.6689,6.6953,4.967,2.5652,0.7361,1.3784,5.4699,1.7066,3.2769,5.0722,1.6009,0.2072,1.2372,1.6625,4.9365,5.7331,5.7163,6.0532,3.0485,4.0838,2.5925,0.0561,3.0755,5.2219,3.4244,1.6206,1.728,1.7892,3.1171,0.9824,4.4454,6.7526,0.5449,2.0379,0.0002,1.6113,5.3678,4.735,3.25,3.0248,2.6769,1.2694,0.3675,3.1906,0.7982,6.148,0.092,0.1311,0.0961,6.2639,0.8326,7.1426,5.7338,5.186,2.6344,5.8987,4.2321,7.2261,0.3212,1.2253,0.4462,0.0538,0.4316,1.7183,0.1748,2.7564,7.8664,0.1108,9.4662,0.158,3.2399,5.5541,4.5844,1.8788,2.8998,3.9034,7.8035,7.4152,3.2716,0.1127,2.6519,2.7064,3.8666,2.4688,4.3415,5.2088,1.8731,0.2897,1.1834,1.5501,5.3828,3.7293,6.4162,0.8511,4.4294,4.7936,4.6358,3.3819,3.5381,0.9717,3.0951,1.9758,0.7189,0.4345,4.0063,0.571,5.6706,0.2253,0.5316,0.0002,2.7608,3.9833,0.888,6.6482,0.0122,0.0868,0.5192,2.0046,3.5916,2.7518,0.4077,3.2939,2.7809,5.6989,1.2006,1.7585,4.032,0.734,2.4936,3.1767,0.0078,0.0863,3.0232,1.4266,0.1656,2.0084,2.0404,5.1144,0.2896,0.7095,2.4231,0.65,0.2377,1.783,4.3216,2.5405,6.6138,3.3361,5.5458,1.3145,3.697,0.871,1.1596,6.4749,4.9168,2.8489,7.0664,5.6127,0.3043,3.8613,2.2798,0.7708,1.5149,4.8558,3.3682,4.2411,2.0103,6.2899,2.5065,0.4185,2.0898,3.1664,2.0283,4.2173,4.7944,0.671,8.4991,2.1632,4.0727,4.8473,0.4005,0.385,4.1855,11.755,0.1261,6.0381,3.6638,1.9254,4.1548,0.1126,9.2999,4.2122,8.1532,4.356,5.7811,1.6775,1.2492]}

Although most of these early inhabitants are considered primitive \u2013 by some, even by some.\n\nThe myth that Southern Somalia was inhabited mainly by hunter @ \u2013, who is a Christian (a Christian sect), is largely the same as that of the Ethiopian (a Christian sect), but it is also the most common belief in southern Somalia. It has existed for a long time, but was suppressed in the early 20th century. The myth has gradually lost some of its meaning and was later suppressed in the late 1980s. It is now believed that modern settlers of southern Somalia acquired the local Somali identity by passing the tribe name and ethnicity to more recently displaced Somalians to enter southern Somalia. However, in some cases, the tribe name was chosen as a symbol of a \"new\" land.\n\nSouthern Somalia has become a cultural phenomenon in recent years and is now in most areas of western Somalia, which may have been more closely associated with the Middle East than with the southern Somalis.\n\nEthiopian, or Afro-Somali, and Ethiopian peoples have always been close political allies, despite being isolated and dependent on the Ethiopian army for their sustenance. African countries do not currently have ethnic relations with Ethiopia.\n\nHistorians are more aware that the ethnic identities of the Ethiopian settlers in southern Somalia tended toward the ethnic and cultural beliefs of the majority of the settlers. This may be related to colonial concerns of the Ethiopian settlers and to the lack of ethnic ties to the region that might have provided opportunities for a larger national group.\n\nThere are certainly many similarities between the current situation of Somalia and the past.

He responded that he had not, and the next day, he was announced as a free agent by the Hokies. Vick said that he will continue working as a player, coach and consultant while playing the sport professionally as well.\n\nVick played on both teams of the 2004 Virginia Tech Blue Devils and the 2005 Virginia Tech Orange Devils. During those years, Vick played in 10 games for Virginia Tech. He also starred for the Virginia and Charlotte basketball teams. Vick had one year of eligibility left on his freshman year of high school.\n\nIn 2010, Vick signed a one-year contract with the University of North Carolina as a free agent to enter the NFL draft. A three-year deal with a guarantee was set to come with the initial NFL draft. Vick appeared in every game, but faced a number of injuries that limited him to only three seasons in the NFL. He was also hampered due to his eligibility. During his first year with the Blue Devils, he took a career-low 10 sacks and suffered only one defeat, a loss to Louisville in the ACC Tournament. Vick played four games in 2008\u201309 and made one sack in the Virginia football title game.\n\nVick finished playing under his former coach, Jim Tressel. Vick scored 383 total yards and four touchdowns in 2006\u201307. In both seasons he recorded seven sacks (one career-high) and five quarterback tacks. With the addition of Todd Bowles at the head coach position and Vick's potential to win a game or two, the Blue Devils looked to get back to the postseason.

Michigan State was also awarded $13,000 from the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Civil Rights for its investigation; the Department of Homeland Security awarded the additional $21,250 awarded to Michigan State University, the University of Michigan.\n\nThe Michigan State investigation focuses on the use of civil rights violations and criminal justice violations to violate individual freedoms. Civil rights violations are defined as violations of human rights, national security, or the promotion of a discriminatory agenda or view as a threat to national security. An estimated 1.5 million citizens of various racial groups in Michigan have been convicted by a federal jury of a range of violations of the freedoms under which they were born.\n\nIn August of 2014, the US Department of Justice announced the decision to begin reviewing the allegations of crimes committed against Michigan State University regarding the use of civil rights violations, or violations of human rights, to break and destroy the state\u2019s civil liberties. The Department of Justice is investigating how the university systematically and negatively affected the lives of numerous individuals in violation of federal civil rights. Specifically, the Department will study how the Department failed to uphold the provisions of Article 9(b)(3) of the University\u2019s Code \u201cguiding purposes\u201d when it used civil rights violations to break and destroy the university\u2019s historic civil liberties. When the Department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights investigates violations of these laws, it begins by investigating the potential harm and expense to the institution\u2019s institutional and constitutional rights, and then conducts further investigations of potential civil rights violations.","token_len":379,"entropy":[7.4895,3.1053,0.2269,3.216,0.1732,8.2401,2.3928,1.2597,4.3512,1.8196,2.2491,0.0066,8.1993,12.3681,10.7157,5.1486,6.7789,8.3611,0.3505,0.6525,4.6336,3.8036,1.1877,0.4731,3.1149,0.0802,2.8304,0.0063,11.0013,6.9945,3.3376,5.0283,1.4204,0.0518,3.1691,0.7719,0.0046,0.9889,2.8125,0.3928,1.7707,6.8717,0.025,7.9084,3.4514,0.3137,2.9119,5.1266,2.2563,1.2876,0.6273,1.4079,0.8345,1.9732,0.9777,1.8419,2.3983,0.6295,0.0631,3.4219,4.1539,5.5862,1.6506,3.9188,0.2637,2.8804,1.7261,5.0774,1.027,4.8303,0.5299,1.3898,3.5105,0.3026,2.4788,0.0038,1.3413,5.389,7.6766,7.4458,1.3085,0.0929,0.262,0.008,1.1715,1.7327,1.9999,6.6755,1.8052,3.058,0.5273,3.4046,0.0023,3.434,2.0732,7.2261,0.2641,5.0972,0.0011,5.6261,5.8392,0.8787,1.2833,0.1515,1.1752,3.0742,3.0418,1.6101,0.0454,0.8759,5.3668,1.1777,0.0011,2.2576,3.919,0.4731,3.878,5.8655,0.1299,1.6978,3.5652,0.0787,6.0896,0.2241,2.1466,3.3003,4.5522,1.9394,4.1094,2.1526,4.0,5.3863,5.0728,1.7604,5.8784,0.106,0.2164,1.557,2.3618,0.4113,1.6986,0.6237,4.473,0.228,1.4813,5.9563,0.3086,0.1738,1.1579,2.5115,5.3994,0.3003,2.0112,4.7361,4.967,2.0224,4.6808,6.7741,2.5542,0.8566,0.166,2.8259,0.0888,0.8438,4.9871,7.2603,2.1833,0.9072,1.8178,0.0915,4.9828,1.9719,4.4449,1.3629,3.1243,3.0779,0.8011,1.6835,0.4728,3.7708,4.639,1.1109,1.3231,2.3794,0.3347,2.8838,2.3621,0.0058,3.0536,0.3719,2.4416,8.1918,3.5524,0.2675,0.3528,1.9903,2.2967,1.8652,1.5601,0.0003,2.5818,3.9793,3.4124,1.5237,0.0428,1.1375,2.7346,0.8168,0.0009,0.0779,1.4225,2.4647,4.2346,0.6043,4.6251,4.6261,1.3255,4.5319,1.3308,4.9618,1.1891,1.2515,1.5961,1.3164,0.5432,6.4728,1.2696,1.5286,0.0292,1.0909,0.0082,0.7467,3.237,6.6852,2.6965,0.2974,2.413,0.0023,0.8031,1.1567,6.2201,5.0245,3.9099,1.7304,3.3525,10.2365,0.478,0.1375,4.467,3.122,0.441,1.3224,1.3711,0.6981,0.0401,2.3887,2.806,4.6785,1.1741,1.5838,5.7613,2.7535,7.0933,1.3271,1.3564,1.8028,0.1135,6.3916,2.3679,2.8232,2.605,0.0205,2.5143,0.569,0.0039,4.1684,5.0759,0.064,0.9064,0.865,4.7275,6.0822,1.5079,0.8863,4.2879,6.4817,0.0329,4.3395,1.2584,5.8539,0.0908,5.191,4.5848,2.3894,1.1756,1.0496,1.55,0.4525,0.1139,0.1014,4.6955,7.9587,0.077,0.042,2.3091,6.5613,0.0687,13.5257,3.8149,7.1598,2.8311,7.3579,5.35,0.8909,3.1998,1.557,0.0117,0.2448,0.5321,1.9004,0.6072,0.0822,0.8303,1.4257,1.5611,0.0062,0.0103,8.3441,2.2644,0.7754,0.4912,7.2678,1.0594,0.6854,9.333,0.0696,0.0208,2.556,0.0122,0.0212,0.0045,3.7126,1.2701,0.2872,3.1282,4.4471,0.4207,0.7274,7.721,4.1583,2.3969,1.4136,5.3213,5.3197,2.8774,6.4721,1.0816,1.1099,3.7179,1.8759,0.0132,0.0465,6.544,2.1883,5.7879,1.3843,2.2361,1.5536,2.7688,4.0298,3.7217,0.8858,2.4654,4.4252,2.6797,0.0408,0.0794,1.0052]}

Six different weapons \u2013 including the top-notch talent of RB Mark Ingram \u2013 had an impact, including a huge third \u2013 fourth offensive unit \u2013 of RB Adrian Peterson Jr., RB Nick Chubb and receiver Demarcus Lawrence. The running game featured an impressive mix of speed, athleticism and strength, and the defense showcased a talented, if somewhat limited, rushing attack that provided explosive plays for both teams and kept up a respectable pace.\n\nIt was an all-or-nothing year for the Pirates, but they had plenty of weapons on offense, including four NFL passing stars in Lamar Miller. In his second season on the NFL scene he had an impressive season; he has six touchdowns, a whopping 33 catches, and nine passes defensed in a season that saw him produce his fastest 100-yard football season in the NFL.\n\nDespite the results both teams were looking for, all three defenses featured a quarterback who could command an edge that could have a long and dangerous life ahead, or had arguably his final season, as the Pirates quarterback had his best year in school history with 42,100 yards to go with 48 touchdowns and 25 interceptions. His biggest challenge since leaving school was having more touches (12 per game) than he would have enjoyed at Auburn, although this was because he was one of only two players in Auburn to produce more than four hundred snaps per game this year.\n\nIt was a good thing for Alabama which had one of the best offensive and defensive lines in the country and the Crimson Tide had the second best running game in the country.\n\nOverall, each team displayed a lot more intensity and more speed than last season, but both defenses had a ton of work to do.","token_len":379,"entropy":[8.493,5.2781,0.1333,1.9958,12.9087,1.7017,16.9744,10.9915,3.6504,3.1658,0.5107,4.8152,2.0594,4.9182,1.6355,0.9621,2.8154,2.2495,8.5889,1.9589,7.0734,5.4502,0.4642,2.8486,9.0115,13.4301,0.2424,11.9257,1.8197,0.1462,3.5552,3.532,5.2976,0.3658,7.7,4.9718,6.5632,2.8261,3.0871,3.0904,4.3612,2.3107,4.3607,0.0004,7.13,2.9816,5.4661,5.3481,0.3299,0.8618,3.4377,3.6648,1.3028,2.4991,3.1392,3.0389,3.9238,6.0217,5.5026,6.2847,5.5064,4.6178,2.9542,6.4838,4.329,5.5477,0.078,7.4884,0.8106,1.0983,5.6319,4.8227,0.0002,1.0183,6.8313,5.5343,1.3186,0.0001,1.3263,0.3882,2.3729,5.2024,0.4238,5.4241,3.0397,2.5042,2.5721,0.0546,2.9648,1.0557,3.0897,0.2799,4.1308,0.9624,1.3512,1.584,2.674,5.547,1.5663,5.559,2.906,4.9643,2.5169,3.4303,0.1644,4.0203,0.2006,2.3728,4.9774,6.78,4.1413,2.4439,2.6716,1.8631,4.4571,4.9066,3.7507,2.7021,5.7045,2.1548,1.6455,0.6632,0.0009,4.1821,1.062,2.4804,4.6822,0.0991,2.8742,0.0027,0.0026,4.1551,0.3267,0.4997,1.8334,0.9383,2.3743,2.0242,3.3703,3.6377,0.4962,4.7196,2.311,1.4596,1.7923,2.2458,4.2811,6.7569,5.0389,6.4534,2.9569,6.5428,0.5093,5.4855,3.5417,3.388,2.6402,0.5865,3.6534,0.1463,5.199,4.4496,4.5845,2.8772,3.0703,1.8777,2.9664,6.3117,1.425,5.2158,5.3979,1.7633,1.6781,3.5701,5.8244,5.7175,3.1151,1.2285,1.3967,4.7866,5.7564,0.3484,0.0075,1.4444,3.3527,2.1832,1.0396,1.2868,0.4376,4.9167,5.0011,5.8802,4.9722,0.7462,0.0224,10.0651,3.527,1.5487,3.6199,2.1053,0.4144,1.7356,0.0002,4.4396,1.5418,6.1664,8.1306,0.9538,2.4437,3.5475,0.352,0.5659,5.7258,2.0059,6.2303,5.8141,1.9045,4.6932,1.2688,2.1402,5.7346,3.191,5.48,4.7676,2.8093,4.7864,2.0416,4.5709,2.3783,5.4695,5.7943,3.7145,4.7171,3.7864,5.7089,7.2176,5.8969,6.7878,1.3465,4.8087,2.5178,1.8359,2.493,5.846,3.2072,2.9166,1.2065,2.0771,1.7958,4.5136,0.6248,3.0136,6.5785,4.977,5.8401,1.6203,4.7764,0.433,3.7422,5.7719,0.8998,0.8581,5.3586,0.2776,0.3614,3.9497,4.9972,3.3414,7.5893,3.758,1.9349,0.5085,5.1273,5.4006,5.1459,3.1894,3.8779,5.6865,0.1388,0.8029,0.9901,1.8813,3.6299,0.3037,4.5984,3.3241,7.5804,1.0427,5.2377,4.1954,1.2536,5.2384,1.3397,1.4945,5.616,0.0661,1.5801,1.5241,2.4288,0.6781,6.7792,4.3412,4.5314,1.8287,0.4935,4.3173,4.1232,4.8116,2.1707,0.3648,4.7576,1.2791,0.5043,0.7709,0.0002,3.8679,0.8115,1.2835,3.1777,3.8279,1.2735,4.6195,7.1289,1.9098,3.8544,0.0823,0.1417,1.09,1.6802,4.8363,0.2131,1.9548,0.1552,0.327,0.5232,2.6306,3.0718,4.7487,0.0038,2.1644,2.0923,3.5135,1.2025,3.2656,0.6687,0.548,0.1739,0.4606,0.9138,2.6802,0.0002,4.61,0.3998,6.0964,0.7505,4.9738,1.354,2.9837,2.885,6.5739,1.132,5.0914,4.8417,0.7236,3.6682,1.8539,0.7262,1.4864,3.6509,3.8662,2.8018,1.8743,4.5219,0.098,4.0254,0.1749,0.0505,2.0027]}

The law also bars the sale and trading of the symbols, as well as the sale and trading of flag items. The law went into effect in January 1997, but the national symbols are destroyed after 10 months. If the flag is destroyed, the Polish flag will remain in its original state and remain in other places.\n\nIn 1992, the law came into effect only after the Polish parliament passed legislation that banned the sale and trading of the flags for the state, but a few national symbols remained in the state as well. In the beginning of the 1990s, the Polish constitution forbade the sale of flag items such as the national flag and national flag of the Polish national flag.","token_len":379,"entropy":[6.6207,5.5158,4.4526,1.2188,10.6071,3.122,7.2152,7.3109,4.4867,2.5655,0.9033,2.9568,0.5465,12.9979,10.9743,3.7304,1.0547,0.5924,6.1006,1.134,3.2833,7.7443,7.5745,3.9062,2.6183,4.1827,0.1367,3.715,4.395,0.311,2.9577,4.3655,5.661,7.0233,2.0381,8.957,0.8008,1.1931,1.8166,3.3742,2.9253,2.4206,0.5693,3.1393,1.3972,2.2425,1.8098,5.3551,3.511,3.1901,6.061,0.0517,6.7791,5.0303,2.8781,0.8239,2.426,7.0651,2.6625,1.7284,5.2742,2.8109,2.9221,7.9135,0.7933,6.3078,3.6787,5.0354,3.4346,4.4688,4.5714,4.6057,1.5623,3.9191,0.4071,3.567,5.6713,0.4377,4.4346,3.4998,4.2731,0.0459,5.0215,4.3988,4.985,4.86,2.4126,0.0016,0.9507,2.3841,1.4199,1.5154,5.1156,3.8927,0.5329,0.0049,0.8816,2.8454,5.8625,4.8295,0.6221,0.8435,2.2863,0.0219,3.3484,1.3793,2.4923,0.2098,5.8118,1.2791,4.9144,6.0608,0.935,4.8382,2.2865,7.0974,0.2965,4.1701,2.0806,4.4921,1.3779,0.9228,1.5902,2.0918,3.6839,0.1872,0.0028,0.347,1.5985,0.7636,2.2494,5.7809,0.4343,2.1978,2.2304,2.711,3.3767,3.4271,1.284,4.6937,3.7454,1.0811,2.7018,7.5056,2.4723,5.3225,0.0507,4.433,0.5942,0.0144,3.5753,4.5923,4.8687,2.2601,4.008,1.7528,0.0027,2.154,6.4279,5.1411,0.5265,3.9601,2.2774,2.2832,3.2295,0.0474,2.0415,0.3097,4.2407,4.9191,1.5124,2.7932,5.6579,4.2304,0.6731,2.0938,12.7308,7.6666,6.3374,6.0288,1.8392,4.5905,3.9248,2.6744,1.247,0.7512,0.9933,0.0002,4.7583,0.1099,0.7611,2.6777,0.3302,3.8917,1.3673,2.0748,1.5175,2.8933,6.2186,8.0743,6.0109,6.5603,6.5772,7.874,4.1052,5.0733,7.4662,6.1278,2.6181,6.842,0.0937,3.7968,1.2979,2.0334,3.0456,4.6094,0.7349,3.9773,2.7886,1.2505,0.372,5.6935,1.6939,4.3405,0.1142,0.319,4.429,0.9424,1.2911,0.0289,0.5172,2.1405,1.4708,3.1627,3.9231,4.2736,7.449,1.1965,1.2735,2.0725,1.1747,1.6878,1.1781,1.5664,6.1813,0.5112,1.2945,1.0756,1.6157,0.0446,2.1352,4.8674,2.9528,3.3818,0.5676,0.014,0.8633,2.6668,0.5683,1.2209,0.088,5.4558,5.1795,1.6647,1.7734,0.6245,7.4455,0.4364,0.0331,0.881,3.1226,3.8426,1.0019,0.7305,1.8587,4.386,1.4596,2.8379,5.0747,4.2314,5.1998,3.6971,0.7731,5.2537,0.9783,2.4879,0.819,1.1415,0.862,1.1218,3.6578,1.0437,2.4951,1.5009,0.4635,2.108,0.5694,1.2403,2.5879,4.7443,0.9265,6.3941,4.1529,1.1377,0.8403,0.0002,2.538,3.8837,0.2361,1.0873,2.5934,5.0654,0.0177,0.5703,4.0833,2.0313,1.2462,2.3232,3.4314,1.6043,2.9286,2.3543,2.8918,0.2864,0.4137,0.4813,0.8713,0.0214,1.4205,4.4206,3.6009,2.7118,3.9192,2.1306,2.4622,5.239,3.0932,5.6818,0.5227,1.5582,0.5643,1.7042,2.3463,4.1652,1.3985,0.2907,2.3695,3.1474,4.8547,0.4226,2.0548,2.2126,0.0582,0.187,1.0411,1.5252,4.9887,4.5979,0.024,0.4534,0.5036,1.1574,5.1379,0.5118,4.7458,0.004,0.6386,1.8733,1.0389,1.8449,1.9328,2.4131,2.2555,0.9408,2.4797,4.7777,2.2962,0.9355]}
{"id":4452,"ended":true,"length":365,"text":"Metal Gear Solid is often recognized as one of the key titles involved in popularizing the stealth game genre. The idea of the player being unarmed and having to avoid being seen by enemies is one of the best aspects of the genre. Not sure a true 'game' like that would survive such a test, but it is possible that it may have gotten out of the way in an attempt to be more stealth-friendly.\n\nIn the video game genre, there are often many different things to keep an eye out for, especially when it comes to sneaking. It is important to keep up to date and use new and interesting gadgets and tools whenever you can, as you often encounter more enemies and things if you keep on running from them.\n\nThe video game and the video game world have grown to form one of the largest communities of all time - there are various ways to find out more about each other. Of course, the best way to find out more is to see some of the more recent video games in the games community. It is really important to know more about each specific game such as how it was adapted by the original series and how it was adapted or adapted for the new era, as it will greatly help to understand and understand how the other games have evolved and evolved over the years. It is also very important that you check out as many of the games from the community as you can as well.\n\nCheck out the video game community websites that we know as being of interest to you and check out the forums that are also popular for game reviews and community articles. If you prefer to keep to online gaming at home, that might also be a good reason to check the forums or the forums that are in your area.\n\nThe latest video games have been released.

Townsend has drawn critical criticisms of his sound for the sheer amount of room he has available for his distinctive \"drums and piano riffs, all of which have a distinctive \"whole-song\" atmosphere.\n\nIn \"A New Way To Music\" for instance, the guitarist is shown playing with his left hand. And Townsend says \"I like playing with my left hand very much\".\n\nThis is one thing, but Townsend and I play every once in a while --- \"If you only put a finger up your arse,\" he says. \"I play that way often, and it keeps everything interesting.\"\n\nOn the other side he may be making some weird decisions - \"I want to leave off my trumpet lines,\" he says. \"But the music always has more than that\" - or maybe the song is actually that slow and inelegant.\n\nBut what is more mysterious about Townsend is also his vocal style. \"I do a nice little harmony work for a lot of stuff,\" he says, \" and I also like to play and play with the other instruments as well.\"\n\nSo when you hear \"A New Way To Music\" in \"a house of such beautiful qualities\" -- an unusual choice for Townsend -- you take notice.\n\nIn fact Townsend has been pretty creative -- \"I play mostly piano and stuff like that, and use my natural voice and singing abilities to play songs,\" he says. Townsend uses both his real and artificial voices (like \"Drummer (as opposed to \"Drummer\" in other ways), and the way bass and drums sound.\n\n\"Then you hear my real voice and you know that this isn't so,\" he says.","token_len":380,"entropy":[3.2258,6.9071,12.4687,8.7456,4.4829,12.3357,10.8128,11.8649,0.9609,12.0502,3.9349,2.3468,3.5618,2.2256,13.4544,2.6182,4.9387,0.7222,6.3513,11.336,2.6639,6.9673,3.7136,7.8749,2.4151,6.2936,7.7079,8.6053,1.2374,1.2532,1.5909,1.5823,4.0181,2.1536,6.7781,6.8288,6.8877,1.4503,1.7008,4.3171,2.8462,2.9369,5.588,1.4708,0.0114,5.2112,1.4532,1.8309,3.5531,2.099,2.1739,5.9868,4.4985,6.9136,0.7554,1.9722,5.2562,6.9864,0.0753,5.0166,4.7421,1.4918,0.0831,2.9095,2.0942,4.2919,3.9349,5.842,1.3293,2.0819,5.0423,0.8172,6.0235,1.8924,3.0321,0.1049,2.6616,5.0436,3.8634,3.687,3.6559,3.4453,6.0154,2.1096,5.0858,5.6924,0.1227,2.8227,5.3807,3.7317,4.188,2.0388,3.7401,2.1232,5.0444,0.4648,3.632,5.5592,3.317,4.0087,3.3272,1.874,3.0839,3.6377,1.17,0.6781,0.9563,0.2919,5.3555,0.0716,5.223,1.6146,0.0004,3.8242,1.5033,3.4821,4.1505,3.3344,1.3584,2.9433,4.2908,3.5766,6.2512,5.8638,6.7682,0.0966,0.3365,0.0055,8.988,4.6386,5.3885,1.069,5.8281,5.0398,2.0823,3.2274,4.1045,3.4377,4.4167,0.2374,4.6395,0.9058,0.8125,1.1177,1.5406,1.7254,3.5911,4.0314,1.2893,5.3432,2.0612,1.864,2.0782,4.9405,6.3268,3.5589,0.9745,0.7085,0.0003,4.53,1.3771,1.3965,3.2602,5.729,4.888,1.2798,4.5273,2.8254,5.1288,4.0897,6.2054,1.9583,0.9591,3.8162,0.326,5.4949,5.2369,2.7859,6.0045,6.9666,2.6293,0.2136,0.4016,0.6168,0.9208,2.7752,3.7695,4.7156,4.4972,2.4386,4.8668,3.5015,2.5724,6.0557,1.5108,3.8228,2.2457,3.514,4.6061,1.2526,4.8346,6.3641,6.4659,1.9258,5.9025,6.4839,0.0052,0.015,0.8682,0.7534,0.0003,3.5288,3.983,2.5774,4.546,6.1383,2.9645,0.4398,1.5058,5.9969,1.0898,5.8137,1.1137,0.4901,1.8588,1.0464,3.9648,2.3571,5.4423,2.4466,5.7918,5.6523,3.8764,2.1371,2.2663,0.0141,5.5278,1.2558,0.1267,0.269,1.9676,0.982,5.6151,1.2003,3.8455,2.4349,0.8417,1.8002,5.4263,2.3637,2.2008,2.5054,4.2838,1.7549,3.9547,0.3277,0.9247,0.4318,0.0003,3.6963,3.3248,2.1226,1.4425,2.7311,1.3626,0.0197,0.0047,0.0377,0.0009,0.5367,2.4456,4.1601,4.7769,7.0782,2.3413,6.6823,5.8783,6.8859,1.8075,4.2067,5.0042,4.4344,4.1166,0.7778,1.5274,0.9271,1.4899,6.6021,2.9982,0.8866,1.2696,0.0003,3.5999,2.1674,4.9246,1.9203,2.1442,6.4198,4.6314,5.7686,1.8544,1.1854,4.2531,6.717,3.5235,1.5694,5.2769,1.6964,0.0085,2.2964,1.3633,6.0048,2.4279,5.3722,2.1629,2.0456,4.6232,3.8701,0.737,3.8368,4.1722,2.6393,0.1041,0.1951,0.2857,5.1271,5.0886,4.8818,2.2665,6.4903,2.7806,4.2629,1.9907,4.517,4.0449,2.5706,5.2249,3.7748,6.82,5.7618,4.0323,0.0041,2.9834,2.4608,0.401,2.4072,2.3107,4.8162,2.5292,1.9273,1.2174,3.476,3.6938,6.4955,3.1045,0.6557,2.584,1.6936,0.7337,0.0002,2.384,6.6714,2.8452,2.0427,2.5527,4.3125,0.3893,1.8293,3.4561,2.307,1.8692,3.6374,4.0328,0.0006,4.3138,5.9046,0.266,0.3041,0.3402]}

A $ 300 million flood management project around the turn of the 21st century to ensure that Napa Valley wine-producing areas are prepared for a future wine country will likely result in a huge influx of new tourists while preserving the wine economy of Napa Valley, the largest wine region in the U.S.\n\nThere are hundreds of vineyards in Napa and nearby Santa Rosa wine regions. If, however, the historic Napa Valley wine regions are not prepared for a future wine country, and the new development happens later in the decade, the city of Napa could also be suffering as a result of this trend.\n\nBut there are also certain events that may be of interest to the city to help people decide what to wear in the future and to attract a new tourists. Most often, a winery owner comes in to see if his or her vineyard has the right equipment and that is very helpful in ensuring both a winery and the wine community are prepared. The local grape growers and industry representatives should also give a nod to the wineries or wine companies that have been established in and around the city.\n\nOf course, there are also certain events that may be of interest to the city, such as wine sales in town. However, as always, make sure you are planning for the future before you travel out to Napa Valley.\n\nThe California wine scene has long been known for its many distinctive wine regions and wines. During many of the Napa Valley wine festivals which are held each summer, wine and food-related events are organized in large groupings or events near the cities centre.

{"id":1783,"ended":false,"length":333,"text":"The battles between the Song and the Jin spurred the invention and use of gunpowder weapons. There are reports that the fire lance, one of the earliest ancestors of the firearm, was fired into the air in the Battle of Song.\n\nThe Song was invented in 1861, the Second Battle of Song, and is a small gunpowder weapon in use by the British forces in their fight against the Hun King King of Korea. Although it was named the Song, it is often misunderstood. In fact the name, Song, literally means the \"gunpowder weapon\", a name borrowed from the British language, and is common in later languages.\n\nAccording to the Song, the fire lance, which was carried out on the part of the soldiers, fired in a series of small rounds to fire on the Hun King. After the defeat of the Huns on February 12, 1853, the English garrison fought a \"bloody battle\", forcing the rebels to retreat to the British Channel. After the battle, the Chinese troops withdrew to China where they met the British in their fight with the Huns. During the battle they brought the rebels with them all the weapons, ammunition and other weapons of use, some of which they held. In addition, the battle took place in a very hot and humid weather where the Chinese were the predominant force.\n\nSee also\n Hun dynasty (1850\u20131948)\n Song dynasty (1948\u20131976)\n Song dynasty (2007\u20132019)\n Song Dynasty (2011\u20132018)\n\nNotes\n\n Thomas Merton, The Second Battle of Song (B.

They hoped the Government would use the term'socialist' as it was used in the previous week to describe those opposed to the'socialist' project.\n\nAfter a bitter political struggle with 'Socialist' opponents, the Government decided that the Party should run in the Republic on 2 January and that would be in the interest of 'Socialists'.\n\nThe Opposition Government wanted everyone to agree that the State was a nuisance, especially in the South East, or that they could no longer run themselves and to vote in the Republic.\n\nAs part of its campaign for support, the Opposition Party made the first public appearance in Dublin since the outbreak of the Civil War.\n\nThe day after the announcement, the Opposition Party made the press conference to announce that their members would run for both the RUC and of the Assembly.\n\nThe Opposition Party also announced that the government would give away \u20ac40,000 each to the first four candidates in the Republic seat of the Tipperary Republic.\n\nThe Government had agreed that by the end of November and throughout the following winter the Government intended to give out \u20ac2.5 million per candidate to the first four candidates.","token_len":380,"entropy":[9.0244,12.4974,0.2333,10.4006,2.9782,5.4628,8.6851,1.3023,7.2672,3.0839,2.7508,11.464,4.925,0.9416,3.9064,6.213,1.3894,5.6061,0.4004,0.031,0.1614,2.2972,0.0038,4.5926,1.5131,0.1514,0.2295,5.956,3.811,3.7614,1.5794,4.0302,9.0191,7.6923,6.2814,0.5574,3.7362,5.1222,1.2142,0.0262,5.9274,5.9046,0.4122,4.0492,5.123,4.2087,0.8809,3.0814,0.0123,0.3892,4.5627,5.4775,1.3902,4.5148,0.0243,3.0036,2.9458,0.6412,1.291,4.4809,1.8826,3.4064,0.4523,0.0557,0.2595,0.4932,0.0008,1.2962,4.4767,3.2247,1.5512,3.6945,3.1827,2.0771,0.321,4.555,6.648,5.0617,2.4293,4.7282,4.4588,2.1928,3.9766,5.3816,3.3382,0.7119,1.8661,4.1292,4.6304,3.8401,3.9274,0.5977,4.9116,1.4991,1.331,1.3486,3.3432,3.3217,3.5696,5.2302,1.3819,1.31,5.6343,0.982,4.4264,1.7674,1.6874,0.8578,0.0003,1.6193,0.0005,3.3938,2.5822,7.4346,1.3986,0.9926,1.2845,1.6751,8.3734,4.2053,4.2544,1.0511,4.924,2.0644,0.8971,4.4011,6.1252,0.5681,5.2475,1.6499,3.2368,2.1779,9.019,16.2543,4.6993,6.845,5.3894,5.0817,2.6706,3.3565,2.7784,4.1333,2.9987,2.4648,0.3772,4.6253,1.2251,6.4248,7.3861,8.8611,0.4836,5.0142,2.3875,4.3696,1.912,1.2021,1.1215,1.194,3.794,5.5127,2.9895,0.5862,4.3594,3.372,0.0197,1.0279,11.3609,1.1071,0.194,4.166,6.4476,0.5183,0.8538,0.0004,4.6324,2.7842,6.2229,4.0982,2.427,3.4549,5.7568,4.7263,0.8882,0.8841,4.4754,0.7895,1.0237,1.7556,2.5117,2.4199,1.5659,6.3278,2.2889,6.2274,3.6788,1.3316,5.8758,4.7662,5.8158,2.2524,3.3594,2.5758,4.8312,1.3121,5.13,1.7522,3.9406,0.0104,2.9421,2.9875,1.4985,1.0755,0.8963,0.0003,1.8509,3.2965,2.6542,4.8349,7.6082,0.4317,3.4629,0.9357,1.19,1.9358,1.8335,2.3862,1.6849,1.7121,5.2677,2.2607,1.5188,4.8389,4.5864,1.6875,6.3469,1.3314,3.2388,2.3897,3.8149,0.018,3.535,6.5656,3.4047,5.7525,5.1575,2.5391,1.3208,2.9353,0.6568,0.7089,0.0003,4.4419,4.2898,0.0012,2.7029,2.728,2.4158,4.8555,0.9807,0.4112,1.5677,2.1757,4.6024,2.7106,4.6008,3.5318,1.407,1.0503,2.1124,7.2722,1.4265,3.0684,0.0031,0.3631,1.6433,0.0105,0.7793,1.0728,0.0003,1.6876,5.8015,0.9275,0.6223,4.2633,1.1954,1.5648,2.4953,1.0819,4.083,2.4616,7.1876,2.4647,2.2998,0.7525,1.2627,4.3799,4.0596,0.8334,3.2224,0.9814,6.5465,0.8919,6.5814,3.1439,0.5985,6.0022,0.4015,4.0957,0.7667,0.5689,0.0004,1.416,2.9522,0.6734,3.5211,1.5183,0.6601,2.5105,5.0593,0.404,3.9602,5.3158,4.2768,4.2506,0.3878,0.0228,3.6056,0.614,1.3332,4.9889,4.2535,1.2265,2.4877,0.5849,1.4307,8.4606,1.3168,4.2936,6.4343,1.2788,0.0,3.4036,0.8014,0.4464,0.0003,1.2434,2.9701,3.188,5.3683,1.8611,5.1724,1.9859,0.7705,0.0016,3.2886,4.7668,6.7107,0.3821,3.0323,4.8941,2.5489,2.5655,6.3914,0.0402,2.1978,2.4037,1.5729,3.9322,2.2946,0.8586,0.2014,3.6235,2.7986,1.4966,1.1116,1.9122,0.58,0.7006,1.243]}

The Michigan State University was originally designated as a \u201cUniversity of Southern California,\u201d but eventually acquired the name \u201cCaltech University.\u201d Located on the California coast, Caltech University is now located in Berkeley, California.\n\nIn the late 1930s we lost the California State University name to the University of Maryland, where it later merged with the University of California-Berkeley. The University of Maryland was later renamed Caltech Community College, and renamed as the University of California-Berkeley (UCCB). UC Berkeley was renamed as UC Berkeley and was a public private university. The University of California Berkeley then moved its affiliation from Davis University to its current location at UCCB, but a few years after the transfer, we also relocated its name to UC Berkeley.\n\nIt is with great sadness that our friend, Professor Bob G. Tompkins, who has also given his name to Caltech, passed away in 2009. Born in 1922 in New York City, he grew up in California City, where he studied law, education, history and religion. He left Caltech to start a private law firm in 1968 in Los Angeles, California. A year later, he founded Caltech Law Department where he taught criminal court. From 1975 to 1981 he was the Director of criminal defense and served as an assistant professor of civil and professional justice for many of the other professors. His work during his time in the department has included teaching the law, law education courses and the criminal justice system at law schools in the United States and the United Kingdom. In his tenure in the department, he was able to find significant and important information and research funding for many criminal cases.","token_len":380,"entropy":[11.0486,0.2504,1.7889,11.8115,1.4293,4.8497,14.5448,6.4155,4.8661,8.4324,5.8294,3.9691,8.6682,6.5425,5.3071,6.0384,2.6788,7.3133,3.5977,0.7457,3.9184,8.3123,0.3266,4.8012,1.5219,11.1432,1.2386,0.5168,1.2772,8.5255,9.784,0.0403,4.7373,2.6987,1.2181,6.5558,6.5722,1.4377,1.8032,5.0776,0.3505,0.3989,3.2023,4.835,5.4534,1.121,0.9313,12.8939,6.0741,4.4403,0.3647,5.4283,0.1372,2.6706,7.014,8.0287,2.0285,5.2312,6.3274,2.0507,2.0665,4.2721,0.0825,3.2791,1.7483,2.1988,1.4941,4.5474,1.7746,6.9431,1.8649,0.7993,4.1811,1.3011,0.3568,1.6119,0.0628,2.408,1.0401,4.099,2.207,0.731,2.9945,0.499,0.2828,0.4194,1.3438,0.0006,2.704,2.6923,2.105,3.7447,0.0966,7.8393,6.5138,1.9342,3.9694,3.6251,0.8046,4.4363,1.9569,0.8206,3.0008,0.0324,5.6765,1.4406,3.2228,0.8703,5.7578,5.1362,0.181,0.6143,0.6743,0.024,1.2521,3.4275,1.7376,0.0001,0.6652,1.8158,1.6808,0.4706,1.0359,1.802,4.1923,0.4482,2.5999,0.5527,6.4312,0.193,1.5109,1.7939,3.6555,3.9249,2.7236,1.0199,0.013,0.7699,1.0714,1.2884,0.0002,3.247,4.2691,3.7035,1.3992,0.3533,4.8121,0.9522,1.4315,1.746,2.7544,2.395,1.0535,4.5336,2.8964,5.1903,4.2955,7.5413,1.1319,1.715,1.8931,1.603,0.1663,0.1695,3.7779,5.8446,3.2675,3.6955,6.3644,2.7287,6.3361,3.4825,0.3437,4.4611,0.5799,0.7594,1.2621,5.8549,0.7884,0.2155,2.0812,3.7785,4.9048,3.1057,0.3715,2.5648,1.6475,3.1008,1.3693,4.2187,5.2629,3.7751,2.7371,2.0115,0.3253,2.2192,0.9294,0.8603,0.772,0.0003,4.8303,0.8236,5.2052,0.5066,0.6399,0.141,3.6308,4.5972,1.9477,3.3598,5.5667,4.7802,2.1795,5.7769,4.4051,0.0047,0.5317,2.6761,2.3566,5.0445,4.2035,2.5242,1.8777,0.2955,2.8677,0.2528,0.9463,4.3726,0.0336,1.4231,4.6964,0.5357,7.4406,0.4257,6.1673,1.2833,4.1468,0.5809,0.1494,0.1455,1.5718,3.8727,0.0027,0.1714,3.6286,4.1177,0.8768,1.9363,0.2594,2.0937,2.7685,1.6553,6.4213,0.3768,4.5426,1.3369,5.6085,0.3588,0.9403,4.5124,2.984,0.2597,2.077,4.0674,1.5137,2.4417,2.5752,1.4355,1.3744,4.5458,3.4281,2.9205,0.0059,1.033,2.3005,0.5414,4.5008,2.6232,0.1766,0.7809,0.3592,2.5218,1.7771,0.5198,0.5381,6.8749,4.4432,0.0505,3.0527,5.138,7.4944,2.3996,4.901,3.6506,0.502,2.7209,1.2278,1.306,1.7652,4.2979,0.0654,6.8946,3.5493,1.6399,3.3437,0.3012,2.6168,2.0716,2.5232,0.9718,3.3133,1.6993,6.6437,5.5608,3.2663,4.382,3.1674,0.3643,5.6897,4.4616,2.0235,3.7655,2.6708,5.57,1.7408,1.2927,1.6015,1.853,4.6289,2.8713,3.5144,4.0705,2.6399,2.1201,2.5839,3.4298,5.1691,5.9412,1.56,2.5296,2.0957,0.8327,1.0039,3.969,5.8138,0.2926,2.2223,1.7579,0.9486,0.0023,1.2652,3.2788,0.687,0.0123,0.1375,2.8013,3.7003,4.6042,3.2722,0.8978,1.5793,0.7342,0.3185,2.2112,3.2923,0.0047,5.3801,4.8285,3.5854,3.4661,5.9388,2.7863,4.2712,6.4336,2.1408,3.0567,3.393,2.6662,0.9993]}

The German forces were eventually transferred to the French Forces on 6 May, and on 8 April, the Germans finally were defeated. On 9 May, the Allied forces and the French forces were reconsecrated by General de Villek. Following the formation of the French Offensive Forces on 14 July, the General had the honour of moving his forces from Emsworth to Rotherham.\n\nAfter the defeat at Rotherham, a new Battle of Britain was fought on the Isle of Man. This first Battle of Britain was fought on 8 August 1941 by German infantry and was won by the French Forces on 18 July, with more than 100,000 casualties. On 29 August, the French troops took command of the French Forces on 8 August. On 9 August, and on 10 August, the Allied forces were destroyed by French forces without cover. On 10 August, L\u00fctzow, on his way back as part of the US Expeditionary Command, was seized and imprisoned before he could take command of the Western forces, which were transferred out of France on 23 October 1941. Later that month, on 12 September, L\u00fctzow was captured in the Isle of Man and was executed on 21 January 1944.\n\nHe was a member of the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Okinawa and was involved in the construction of the new US Navy.\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n\nCitations","token_len":380,"entropy":[2.5476,5.6718,0.0232,0.661,7.1113,0.0741,2.508,3.9933,4.0595,2.1559,2.2515,0.2539,4.2196,0.5542,4.8962,0.1991,7.4772,7.0753,5.9948,6.9253,2.4026,1.5117,1.1397,5.4693,12.1125,1.2212,5.3147,3.1671,6.9932,15.3765,3.9926,2.6655,15.5721,2.378,1.8369,1.2201,7.0179,4.3487,3.8494,1.9122,3.1553,8.3219,2.3954,1.4105,2.2579,2.4034,5.0769,1.9094,0.1102,0.6946,1.6888,0.27,0.7256,1.8019,1.2944,0.0905,3.3121,3.552,3.2976,1.7511,0.378,1.8692,4.7609,1.2758,2.4297,4.8385,0.2301,1.2298,4.2588,0.698,4.3218,6.119,7.444,3.1677,5.6757,3.3918,0.2365,5.5424,5.3537,5.3416,0.1358,2.3175,2.0592,5.4674,5.9689,1.3527,3.3595,0.1736,1.0823,5.1532,6.537,3.4835,4.1221,1.0665,1.5184,0.3344,1.6264,3.2604,2.1572,1.3816,5.9833,2.8081,0.1871,0.9462,2.8976,2.2228,1.4822,2.1698,0.2071,1.9592,1.3833,2.8141,1.8829,5.1066,2.1609,1.1918,3.1496,3.8855,5.6527,3.4032,1.9224,3.2021,2.1936,1.8187,0.3912,1.0571,2.2874,0.5273,5.018,1.176,1.2101,0.8838,1.2783,6.0584,9.0903,0.0511,3.11,3.6973,3.963,3.8268,1.969,7.1825,2.2468,5.2869,0.7907,5.9091,0.0256,0.2985,2.0116,6.7994,2.713,1.7069,3.1723,2.9492,0.8305,0.9468,6.1229,4.7207,2.0778,4.2069,0.2961,5.9942,2.5902,1.0571,1.4819,1.5924,0.0113,0.0004,0.2456,5.4686,3.8517,0.0635,1.2974,1.0122,0.0002,3.7014,0.686,2.6424,2.4594,2.1326,0.001,0.0025,0.7689,3.8342,2.2235,7.0481,0.1922,1.6921,1.0356,3.0416,1.5774,2.7734,6.2992,0.017,0.7012,1.9817,2.7659,5.6386,1.8776,0.6867,0.2096,0.8855,1.762,1.0498,3.768,2.0041,1.7222,4.2893,4.4447,4.3646,1.9335,3.8244,3.0373,0.3878,0.9094,2.9721,5.3314,1.6292,3.5769,4.178,1.8367,2.7672,5.9625,0.505,2.7079,0.2412,0.0018,1.7398,0.379,2.9983,4.3888,0.4704,0.2525,0.8803,2.0636,3.3028,4.2843,5.2705,0.3649,0.4613,2.1973,2.2549,1.8367,3.8453,1.905,1.305,2.2675,2.6186,0.2901,0.1664,6.6638,1.2406,0.6958,0.3659,0.0942,0.7013,2.1677,0.2854,1.0204,6.5634,1.107,3.8113,1.6782,7.2782,8.3341,0.7905,1.7775,2.6141,0.5092,0.0935,3.7964,0.031,0.0006,0.003,3.0587,4.0484,0.9948,0.7827,1.6114,7.8741,5.4237,0.0005,0.6022,6.3319,4.6573,0.0059,8.1215,0.5477,1.2298,6.4713,2.2156,3.9462,6.446,1.3586,0.4026,4.2959,2.1149,0.6117,0.3248,7.0326,6.0569,3.01,2.6723,1.0483,4.1379,5.5763,0.1515,2.6279,1.1959,3.4461,2.2847,2.0482,0.2476,5.5762,1.7422,2.2995,0.1952,2.2287,3.534,2.5563,0.1147,1.7492,0.0018,0.0006,0.003,0.5526,3.2118,2.3377,1.7247,6.0555,0.0099,0.199,1.7273,3.3101,2.6632,2.4162,3.7763,3.8258,3.7441,0.4751,0.6405,0.0002,4.5908,0.784,3.8478,2.3706,0.0046,0.1715,5.7547,0.857,1.4795,4.7295,0.1127,0.1527,3.4184,7.293,2.2491,1.4409,4.7407,0.0946,0.8458,1.0177,0.0985,0.4069,3.8507,2.914,3.2711,2.9373,1.7271,0.0002,5.3179,0.9228,0.0004,7.1227,0.331,0.838,0.0004,4.8192,2.1662]}

Lock Haven lighthouses had an electric trolley, designed by the city of Lock Haven, that was towed along the trolley line from one end of the canal boat yard to the other. Although this was the first time the electric trolley was towed to the land, it was still an affordable type of transportation and was used very often.\n\nThe city of Lock Haven started offering trolley service in 1886. On October 3, 1890, the trolley had been towed from the village village to the land. Since then, it was used more often as a kind of transportation. After the completion of the bridge project on the island at Shops, the trolley was removed from the docks. On 19 May 1890, the tunnel was reopened for the first time and replaced with a trolley bridge. In 1898, the water tunnel was opened in Lock Haven. In 1903, the water tunnel was opened in Lock Haven again and replaced with a trolley bridge. In 1907 and 1908, the water tunnel was opened in the town centre as well as at the dock. In 1909 the water tunnel was shut down. In 1911, the boat was towed from the dock to the land.\n\nIn 1908, the water tunnel was open again in Lock Haven again and replaced with a tunnel bridge.

One had long-range observation that observed the composition of the moons moons X and Y as early as October 2011.

They also discovered that Pluto has a'stabilized' ice-free zone.","token_len":380,"entropy":[6.5893,6.0793,2.8367,2.5306,9.1638,0.052,0.1159,0.4338,0.651,5.753,1.6189,4.7626,2.8052,2.7189,12.2703,6.4825,3.2153,3.7252,4.0322,0.2594,2.9418,5.5453,5.5654,5.3593,3.8908,2.4085,1.2506,7.2949,4.8976,0.0,4.4203,5.5623,0.1648,4.7183,9.329,0.737,4.3874,0.4262,3.2195,2.6748,4.4145,0.1445,0.7612,3.9618,1.4506,0.2637,3.3222,1.5255,3.4669,5.1467,7.5409,5.6231,4.0095,1.7072,5.1625,1.2981,2.049,2.327,2.9541,1.7372,4.5052,3.182,3.9284,1.8114,5.4348,2.0691,4.7244,0.0037,0.8612,1.4943,1.8601,2.7605,3.8747,5.7351,4.8065,3.0173,0.1691,3.1473,2.0845,5.1468,2.5292,0.3692,1.3329,1.4435,0.308,0.804,1.3876,4.2585,0.4827,2.6193,2.3998,1.8468,1.0068,3.324,3.467,1.4366,3.2921,0.3595,4.9863,5.5202,1.0185,1.8008,1.1654,5.2697,0.0007,0.6369,2.9718,1.1733,0.3968,1.2956,16.8237,0.6095,0.9407,4.0625,2.2112,1.5459,3.3069,0.1282,2.0247,5.1825,5.2539,1.7538,3.8133,4.6709,4.8207,1.5311,1.3707,0.3396,3.6933,2.6031,4.8699,3.0423,4.7598,3.8334,6.2808,3.0976,4.2552,0.7921,1.8507,2.5644,1.806,3.3741,6.0462,5.5348,0.9572,0.6144,4.0119,4.7345,5.3698,1.2142,1.8752,0.1153,1.1167,4.1515,6.7359,7.0536,2.1455,0.2008,4.592,5.4544,0.0071,6.6757,3.2202,0.816,0.6761,1.7698,0.9776,0.9761,7.8292,5.5259,5.7619,7.1474,4.5862,0.8112,4.21,2.3129,3.7623,0.0381,5.3564,0.0021,3.6512,3.9664,5.5612,2.4305,1.8748,2.7201,1.052,0.9127,0.1667,5.3214,4.353,0.2507,3.1493,5.9332,2.2579,4.9953,4.429,4.4051,4.1468,0.914,4.8331,1.9002,3.9993,3.8549,1.1187,4.6902,5.0781,10.741,4.6176,3.2458,3.3457,3.9567,5.1395,2.3228,2.6965,0.0009,0.4283,2.9622,0.016,1.2649,0.871,3.0593,0.0979,0.0059,1.9254,6.7697,2.1225,1.7593,4.8114,1.8524,4.1719,4.3393,2.9484,6.8079,1.4787,0.3069,4.2568,0.0087,2.3868,4.6985,0.9279,1.7607,5.4187,1.1005,0.4735,0.9309,1.084,3.0796,3.3059,9.1833,0.0624,1.1141,3.0979,0.0277,2.1996,3.0505,4.976,0.2332,0.0253,4.3387,1.5174,8.5704,7.8906,5.0546,2.8798,3.5629,4.8476,4.6174,1.783,5.9912,2.4474,0.5882,6.242,3.3835,2.2008,4.5286,6.0805,2.0282,0.4017,0.7837,0.6655,1.8612,3.8411,6.7418,4.9642,2.1066,5.6954,2.5142,1.498,4.3399,2.0976,3.6909,3.8141,4.2911,0.1405,3.9242,0.2929,2.7868,1.0507,5.6807,0.2271,0.7083,4.0381,3.1517,4.7671,6.6401,1.472,2.1975,4.3315,1.1705,3.9,0.9847,0.3871,2.0625,1.665,5.3054,6.472,2.279,0.3319,4.2256,0.0107,2.4044,3.5082,0.0982,0.9851,1.7207,1.9936,4.1186,3.3149,0.0898,1.2237,1.8735,0.0125,0.0019,1.7747,6.5237,1.1909,4.4574,4.5168,3.7628,3.427,4.0676,5.0951,1.0944,0.3417,2.0867,4.1328,0.0483,0.0033,5.4534,2.6888,3.2884,0.3953,6.2285,4.065,0.1674,3.2632,0.981,0.5526,0.1102,0.9334,2.01,5.3842,2.9022,2.7471,0.9948,1.4768,2.1652,1.062,11.6988,16.3791,7.8444,4.1792,8.6656,5.9081,3.5356,4.027,4.8092,1.8621]}

She arrives on the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher ( Charlie Brooks ), who has been on the run since 2001. They arrest her a month into life and find that she has gone missing, causing pain and a sense of loss. It's a case of having fun and making memories. But there are also some mysteries.\n\nOne mystery is why Janine lost the hair on her head. It may have been inspired, but the question is: why did it look like that? Also, how does this explain how things turned out? Does Janine have a problem? Is Janine an accessory to Janine?\n\nOne mystery may be why it was a good night for them to sleep together. After all, the one who has been on the run might find themselves in need of some help. Could they get out of that house? Maybe even in order for the twins to avoid that sort of thing? Or is it that they may have all been so angry at everyone who has been holding them that they wanted to go crazy?\n\nAnother mystery is why the twins have trouble controlling and preventing Janine from coming back. All the other suspects have been able to stop her. But what happened to the one that was captured in her house? Is she going to make their apartment home as nice and clean as they say they want? Are they just keeping Janine's identity up to date and they haven't been able to find anyone else?\n\nOne mystery is why everyone is so concerned with Robin's murder. She and Archie always seemed to care a great deal about her and were even more fascinated in her than they already were. It didn't seem obvious to them where their obsession was coming from either. But it seemed to be coming so naturally to Archie.","token_len":380,"entropy":[9.8266,12.7716,0.7154,2.6715,11.6798,7.4997,1.5461,5.4199,5.4286,10.6198,8.8954,2.8536,12.4433,12.3062,0.7074,2.3195,4.262,1.6368,5.0015,5.2703,2.1682,1.1193,0.771,4.7099,7.2724,3.0572,6.724,1.4136,5.3377,11.8123,2.1119,8.5151,0.4124,5.9875,7.2714,2.2162,1.5832,2.2176,0.895,4.6083,0.8112,0.959,1.0344,4.987,2.2347,3.6549,5.9512,1.7516,7.0176,3.7274,4.0593,7.6337,1.6351,4.2898,2.196,0.7781,1.4651,4.9858,1.5069,2.423,5.7036,6.7104,1.2339,3.927,4.0653,0.0189,2.5122,0.8063,4.6255,1.6519,2.2505,4.4159,0.7702,5.9754,5.6787,1.7432,4.1121,5.6737,1.1453,4.0735,3.4176,1.3111,2.0905,3.166,4.2035,2.0958,1.603,0.2033,4.7777,3.9022,1.387,3.1489,1.9782,0.0074,7.4051,2.988,5.4372,2.2843,0.3481,1.263,1.0534,2.7669,3.9164,1.1303,0.3673,6.1466,4.316,3.868,2.3032,4.6472,1.1919,2.6141,2.1514,1.9558,2.7969,4.7134,1.4336,3.0089,0.5666,4.8016,0.3343,2.35,2.2716,2.5185,5.4177,3.1577,5.5517,3.5685,0.0232,0.9269,5.5485,2.027,0.0013,1.8534,1.1601,4.7417,3.6752,3.0347,3.1841,0.0008,4.1176,5.7698,0.9316,3.0794,0.0027,1.847,1.7625,0.0003,3.9889,2.728,4.4569,0.5194,1.357,3.9129,1.9448,3.8642,3.6361,5.5489,1.5805,4.6672,2.6122,6.0098,1.3574,0.5972,4.6836,1.2965,0.0673,2.4321,5.6603,1.4868,4.5876,2.0006,4.2093,0.1981,0.2868,5.9214,4.705,5.3766,1.5199,5.08,0.0724,2.2442,1.2695,0.4651,5.2274,2.3048,3.5272,3.3237,0.2906,3.4421,4.7005,1.3921,3.7322,4.6825,5.4603,4.8429,3.5436,2.6236,4.639,0.0981,5.8707,4.7056,6.2776,0.0006,2.2823,1.2448,3.1954,2.5857,1.0057,2.748,1.2803,4.5707,0.9311,5.7027,1.1499,4.6389,5.7232,1.3995,6.5202,2.3059,2.3144,1.2853,5.9646,0.9479,5.053,0.1925,3.4054,0.345,3.4152,5.1953,1.0,0.7889,0.0002,2.5576,0.4733,0.8001,0.6502,1.8376,1.7279,2.5905,5.1973,5.5107,5.8452,7.491,2.2667,0.0061,0.5169,3.7789,0.9626,0.8761,5.159,1.8649,4.0497,4.9953,1.6954,1.7917,4.9172,0.0085,4.0823,1.0294,2.0035,2.7684,2.8157,3.2938,0.5062,1.6682,3.6632,2.6437,2.1734,7.238,2.7024,3.9482,2.847,0.6309,3.0568,1.7672,2.8722,0.1063,3.8268,5.7428,7.2857,4.4118,5.2219,5.9753,1.5364,2.1451,0.0949,1.9094,5.2792,1.977,1.1411,1.3592,4.3142,0.3907,3.9024,6.0767,1.4714,0.0021,2.7383,4.8908,5.2586,0.8873,0.1179,2.192,4.6945,4.8448,0.0004,2.2742,0.9336,0.001,2.0508,4.4832,1.7195,1.3185,0.7808,0.0002,2.7251,1.8165,0.9187,0.4588,5.4948,1.8188,1.3748,3.8645,2.653,9.2374,2.0169,5.0479,0.3394,3.2492,4.5041,1.3249,5.7762,3.0948,0.4967,3.8168,4.5313,1.7915,0.0002,0.3224,1.5306,2.248,3.4204,4.0347,3.9199,6.845,5.6499,1.5626,4.1223,1.2752,5.7475,0.1598,0.8072,3.1256,5.1726,0.0007,1.8977,6.782,1.497,0.8291,5.5842,4.1541,4.1231,0.9498,0.9174,0.0012,4.6083,0.5646,2.3485,2.7129,3.2479,1.7888,1.5039,2.5789,6.9935,3.878,1.8829,5.3385,1.6168]}

{"id":3813,"ended":true,"length":349,"text":"Filming began in San Francisco on March 13, 1923, and lasted until late June. Despite the initial contract between von Stroheim and Goldwyn, Lehr agreed to double the film's budget by the end of the year. The first location production of a work of art in the world was in Amsterdam on April 4, 1922, where Lehr also directed the first of the eight scenes that were filmed. But there did not appear to be a studio at the time \u2013 Goldwyn's art studio had not yet been established and Lehr had moved to Stuttgart.\n\nAt this point, Lehr and Goldwyn had been involved in negotiations for a film contract since 1933. Goldwyn's assistant had said that the film deal was the result of the two working together because the two wanted to have work to film to. After several years of negotiations, Lehr was able to come to an agreement with Goldwyn a few months after the picture's final shoot, but Goldwyn was much concerned that the project had not yet been finished, and he asked him if he would allow Lehr to use his talents as an animation consultant.\n\nLehr eventually agreed to allow Lehr to have his talents as an animator for the film, and he later used them in his animation work for several years. However, the work that Goldwyn was working with as an animator was far from finished, and when he left the studio in 1935, the work was completed in June 1938. It was this work that he said was of \u201chigh esteem\u201d, but also that of the other artists who had worked closely with him.\n\nIn 1944, the film was then produced in London by the Dutch production company Haus. Production of's production of's film of this time was suspended due to the death of Goldwyn and was finally allowed to take place in January 1945.","token_len":380,"entropy":[8.0394,5.3061,1.0517,5.9799,0.5544,2.081,2.8792,3.6245,0.5084,7.2203,0.89,1.3417,4.3228,0.8137,4.5432,2.3218,2.6992,7.106,1.2773,5.2453,8.1919,4.581,8.86,5.9121,0.2067,0.1169,7.6061,3.7923,0.8016,8.5469,3.9685,7.2824,0.1305,7.8394,0.3971,3.661,0.7124,0.6359,2.2283,3.0499,0.6112,0.0301,0.895,0.6291,0.573,1.9391,2.9743,8.1246,6.5786,1.8727,4.2762,5.9442,0.5342,0.9396,1.8829,1.6611,3.2795,1.1361,2.9983,6.1974,2.3841,2.3692,3.2562,0.0842,3.1767,0.8401,3.6086,3.8166,0.0094,5.0102,2.2839,1.7043,1.8577,2.6401,2.1195,5.2964,4.8905,3.0982,1.8049,2.8268,1.3145,6.3061,4.102,7.1353,0.1519,0.8174,0.3206,0.0359,1.6458,4.4881,3.7068,0.7961,0.2045,6.3543,5.5639,0.0043,1.7949,6.4334,2.9096,2.1343,3.0853,1.0686,0.7261,1.7577,2.5775,2.7317,0.0008,1.8186,4.5344,0.8917,5.5409,0.9413,0.0002,1.4328,1.414,0.0037,4.8066,2.1655,1.0036,0.6405,1.8522,0.0029,2.9961,1.8267,0.0008,1.5149,2.9805,4.505,0.2219,3.9419,1.4774,1.254,3.4422,3.9299,6.8274,4.1155,0.8582,3.0157,0.001,2.3166,5.4697,3.5158,5.1801,0.7825,2.1346,2.4859,7.358,1.1576,4.5098,4.3508,0.0035,2.8014,3.8057,3.4803,0.4823,6.107,2.5312,1.3317,3.532,0.6065,3.6454,6.4016,4.867,5.1827,6.0016,2.7622,4.6271,4.1261,2.3138,0.2676,0.9657,0.2695,1.7794,0.0021,2.4604,2.0741,0.0034,4.4502,0.8269,1.5487,0.1453,0.7992,0.7628,0.001,6.3114,0.748,0.8425,1.935,0.7848,6.4225,2.3832,4.7325,3.4931,2.3439,2.8002,2.0761,0.0022,2.2446,6.9967,4.8423,1.1662,1.3789,3.3739,3.5975,1.8197,1.9345,0.5948,2.6838,2.767,0.9405,2.0821,3.8961,3.4444,2.7485,0.5422,1.8416,3.5602,2.09,0.0017,0.2775,4.1367,0.8997,3.4016,2.2362,1.7562,5.2403,4.2081,1.0124,1.4745,0.0002,1.9048,0.0043,5.5689,0.5493,0.4937,3.4549,1.5126,0.0059,0.338,4.9136,1.2702,5.9577,3.4687,0.1622,2.0379,0.028,4.5191,0.7197,0.8275,1.2673,1.3463,2.077,5.2252,3.8488,4.2347,1.674,1.7541,4.2826,1.7622,1.552,3.3364,2.2416,0.7403,3.4708,0.0494,2.4329,4.3346,3.0149,2.798,0.0013,2.8972,2.1183,4.214,5.4581,0.2672,0.5771,0.0017,1.1421,4.218,0.6057,1.105,1.3758,0.3532,4.1989,1.8467,3.948,1.5661,1.2426,1.4594,3.5718,0.5229,2.5595,3.0678,1.112,4.6085,2.2702,4.7744,4.4109,0.4599,3.5742,0.676,3.063,1.9938,0.526,4.2168,6.0648,1.8535,3.5813,16.3604,6.1692,4.9055,5.7091,3.1623,7.3541,2.7889,3.0746,4.1819,1.6001,2.7951,1.749,3.1845,2.3565,1.4601,1.0529,0.7577,4.2977,0.1653,0.6405,1.029,0.762,0.0002,2.4524,4.7556,0.2234,2.5231,2.697,0.8003,7.4079,4.326,1.28,4.4358,2.4102,2.4416,5.6391,3.1635,0.2174,5.0227,4.4118,3.257,5.3236,1.7852,11.6868,5.6023,1.7539,8.4772,3.0188,2.6151,4.3498,2.999,0.9406,4.7457,2.6854,0.0048,1.6509,4.6313,0.0796,3.4268,0.0031,2.5698,3.4602,3.8487,5.308,0.1988,3.3318,0.0966,0.597,4.5998,0.5256,0.3162]}
{"id":2406,"ended":true,"length":365,"text":"Accommodation is the process by which the eye increases optical power to maintain focus on the retina while shifting its gaze to a closer point. The long @ - @ standing medical consensus is that the eye needs to move faster to maintain focus, thereby a greater focus sensitivity. The eye has to focus faster, thus, focus is lost. This means that while the optic nerve can keep an eye focused on an object (i.e., a reference, a lens lens, etc.), the eye has to keep working through different lens lenses to see the object and make sense of that object and its context. The retina, along with reflex nerves and immune system, respond to different factors.\nAs a result of this process, even patients with visual blindness who had the ability to control the eye movements often lost focus to their visual system. In addition, the eye has multiple ways to compensate for visual distortions caused by movement. The typical path of motion in the retina is straight forward motion in the vertical direction. The direction that is in motion can be both directionally directed and horizontally directed.\nIn addition, it is difficult to obtain a suitable spatial or temporal resolution resolution for the depth or thickness of the retina in order to observe the visual system. In addition, if the distance between the retinal surface and eye tissue where the eye is located, e.g., as in a medical practice (i.e., an optometrist or vision specialist, etc.), increases, the amount of light reflected on the surface of the retina is increased. This increase in light reflected from the retina causes the retina to shrink and thus become less focused. The retina also reflects and therefore the depth and thickness of the retina can increase or decrease at different times in the same vision. In the case of incontinence in a normal human situation, the eye becomes incontinuous and becomes too focused on the object.","token_len":380,"entropy":[10.1641,0.3102,4.1033,3.0102,6.2693,1.7754,0.0011,2.3,9.6336,8.0214,8.9273,4.2815,2.7135,4.932,3.1246,1.7178,1.0833,3.6684,3.7732,7.2383,2.0657,3.7336,1.4745,2.1584,5.7756,5.4619,0.7554,2.0788,7.5674,14.3045,6.4229,6.0363,11.1197,12.4811,8.7812,2.0187,0.1518,1.4249,2.0189,4.2069,0.7975,4.05,3.9856,0.8528,1.536,0.6101,2.125,5.1824,6.8447,2.3984,2.8026,6.5028,0.6998,2.211,3.4974,2.8129,1.7053,4.3308,3.7262,3.1134,3.3532,3.714,5.7679,1.6621,1.9176,0.6117,2.714,2.7065,0.5371,4.4052,1.2058,5.281,0.4459,2.8945,4.5501,4.2599,0.1234,1.5984,1.1664,3.107,0.0564,3.5541,3.6734,0.0007,0.0006,0.3471,1.4817,6.9055,3.983,1.5624,4.7806,7.933,0.6517,1.0741,0.3791,1.0144,1.4948,2.5514,0.2356,3.4072,5.2323,4.8034,5.6985,6.3211,4.7637,1.4367,3.7747,1.0651,1.1608,4.0557,4.4525,2.6386,0.022,3.8212,1.6586,3.8175,1.7848,2.5159,0.2991,2.0771,4.1279,3.334,4.949,0.001,8.7567,5.0738,1.7857,7.1715,1.2379,1.1137,5.0223,0.4282,3.9564,5.2752,2.5678,2.8807,9.8833,1.9001,0.4691,1.3349,1.399,2.2902,0.2256,5.9623,7.3694,0.7573,4.1097,4.4279,2.5872,4.7882,4.1491,3.8345,0.0492,4.5426,2.1469,1.7056,3.7791,4.8562,3.7281,0.5529,4.7914,2.9802,3.8484,3.851,0.7632,2.67,2.5915,0.1918,2.1742,2.6318,2.4536,6.5458,4.2337,0.6726,3.9394,0.1403,3.4613,4.7582,3.5196,0.032,5.7613,1.1001,2.2714,6.4153,6.6455,1.3978,4.706,2.4327,1.1601,1.1794,0.5395,4.6441,1.948,3.0702,2.9579,0.7174,5.4219,1.7885,1.3404,1.721,4.5244,3.3501,3.004,4.5686,1.6304,2.5431,0.8588,6.0074,5.0404,0.2212,5.0056,1.107,2.8771,0.4582,0.3334,2.8367,2.4265,2.4039,0.5253,3.9599,0.5157,4.3164,0.3624,6.3727,1.7159,4.6175,5.7147,3.4565,0.4862,1.8452,7.7138,0.9581,1.0595,7.993,4.9259,5.96,0.1199,0.7541,2.8048,3.3393,2.6911,0.0227,5.0353,1.3421,3.5538,2.0105,1.0489,2.4653,2.3297,0.0999,4.1046,0.6896,4.5002,1.2989,0.729,4.5175,0.0661,3.5563,0.2227,4.7132,4.2153,6.9713,0.4126,2.0163,0.9918,0.9741,4.9581,5.7312,0.0024,0.0003,0.0617,5.2786,3.1818,1.453,7.0341,5.2714,4.2652,2.4701,0.0013,0.0008,0.0825,3.4573,4.8229,0.3545,0.0228,2.1267,5.5612,0.8895,2.9186,2.5953,0.2288,6.0218,1.3418,0.7459,3.5308,0.0351,1.7061,3.2397,3.9604,0.1551,4.6467,0.253,0.0347,0.4004,2.8768,2.341,0.605,2.0036,2.8502,0.6428,1.1485,2.382,2.9726,0.1505,0.4442,2.8864,0.9604,1.7952,0.1406,4.7967,1.4563,3.7486,4.5018,1.883,4.5073,0.8407,2.2803,2.6172,1.8653,6.3841,4.3625,5.154,4.5215,3.7449,2.1424,0.08,0.0872,0.1831,1.0436,2.6478,2.1372,3.6703,0.0438,4.1561,0.9821,1.3123,2.0181,0.5605,2.5445,5.2544,1.0891,2.5979,3.1562,1.0397,0.0528,8.1863,3.4926,0.1707,3.3407,1.9008,5.3356,3.3907,7.1587,0.2246,0.8126,3.6256,4.0817,5.479,0.0275,6.819,3.04,1.9016,3.2417,4.6538,2.6582,1.4541,0.7126,1.7646,1.5359]}

{"id":446,"ended":false,"length":346,"text":"Irish writer Garth Ennis then took over the title in 1991, again from 2000 AD, where he had been working on Judge Dredd. He proceeded to write the longest run for any Irish writer \u2013 the book, Detective Conan. Although he wrote a much longer story in the year 2000 AD, his story, Detective Conan, has not only been in print but has become a cultural icon through the television show. Detective Conan was first broadcast on 12 May 1999 on BBC One and BBC Scotland. In 2000, Ennis wrote the screenplay for the BBC Sherlock and BBC Sherlock 2. He also wrote the screenplay for the TV show, Detective Conan. That same year, he wrote two novels for the BBC's Sherlock. One had a series of short stories but had to be adapted because the adaptation process was too expensive to film to allow actors to be on board.\n\nEnnis wrote a screenplay for the English crime drama series, Blood And Wine. He first wrote the screenplay for The Secret Garden, which starred Michael Portray and Ian McKellen. In that film, the cast consisted of actor Ian McKellen as his love interest Claire Foy, and producer Michael Caine, as well as writer Pauline Byrne. Then, Ennis wrote his long-running, hugely entertaining, and extremely violent and tense novel Murder Island. The novel, which was released in 1999 in the UK and Ireland, won the 2002 Booker Prize.\n\nIn 2004, Ennis published another major fantasy story, Mystery Quest.

{"id":1049,"ended":true,"length":348,"text":"`` Swing Low, Sweet Chariot `` is very commonly sung at England fixtures \u2013 especially at Twickenham. The song arrived in the rugby canon through the Welsh male voice choirs who sang many different varieties \u2013 including the chariot, the wales chariot and the Welsh folk chariote \u2013 as well as being a popular vocalised version in English football, the Welsh footballers and the Welsh folk band \u2013 including the Welsh soprano, Welsh singer and Welsh folk songwright.\n\nIn addition, it was recorded as a single at this venue. It came into its own, thanks to the use of a variety of voices, both male and female, as well as a mix of instrumental and vocal arrangements. The use of a variety of music instruments has not only proved useful to the musical output as to song composition but its use to express emotions on a wider public level. As the English footballers\u2019 singing style has always influenced much of the music that plays on football pitches is an important contribution to the musical output of both men and women alike.\n\nOther forms of music also include vocalizations, which sometimes do not appear in English football and, therefore, are only used for the same purpose. For example, in the Welsh folk band, which have been recorded as part of a Welsh project called \u201cKym\u201d in 2011, which mixes vocalizations with an instrumental guitar tune, music that is popular with the Welsh crowd at Twickenham is employed as the background music while other examples of instrumental music are sung on television and in football stadiums.\n\nThe most powerful effect that the song has had on the English and Welsh music industry was the introduction of Welsh language singing into the game as a result of the Welsh National League. It has attracted the attention of many musicians who wish to adopt such styles as that of the national littler English lasses.","token_len":381,"entropy":[13.2106,9.7701,2.4966,7.5443,5.9111,5.1485,0.2074,12.6669,7.0723,5.286,7.1984,5.5442,2.882,9.4092,9.6321,8.3098,3.559,2.5969,6.1913,0.0011,0.0,1.1275,2.3522,2.0073,9.2147,1.276,1.6232,10.0518,7.6827,5.0267,1.1997,6.0549,9.8938,4.0965,8.5236,0.2584,3.9922,2.4106,6.138,2.5053,5.271,4.9377,2.5491,1.4425,9.1973,0.8991,2.0785,1.5633,4.6475,6.5507,7.2246,0.0995,1.3244,0.2934,3.4549,5.8464,3.7676,2.5777,0.0037,14.1138,3.2299,0.3721,0.0017,4.303,3.3387,2.6312,7.1882,5.1463,2.8803,3.4067,3.4735,3.2332,2.6792,3.3577,2.9742,3.3077,3.8864,2.2045,1.3347,1.4223,4.1315,5.4101,5.7263,4.2884,1.4449,2.0925,8.0662,3.1305,0.0065,1.9328,3.8699,3.6374,1.0375,1.1863,2.8452,2.7408,5.3229,1.8919,1.6213,0.0026,2.8517,3.572,1.2574,3.0569,1.2662,2.921,3.1926,0.7743,3.5752,2.8279,5.8613,4.2939,2.5251,2.368,5.4048,3.4966,3.5638,0.2289,4.0664,5.7438,0.1505,1.1849,3.9071,0.0028,1.9088,5.0526,0.0221,5.2878,1.7516,4.4902,1.764,0.0352,0.0029,0.9866,3.088,0.7955,0.0035,2.3629,4.2154,0.1122,5.8166,0.6019,2.9701,4.3819,0.457,1.8084,5.7872,0.0115,2.3679,2.1105,0.0037,5.218,4.2844,3.342,4.334,2.3277,6.2825,3.2403,2.1439,0.9701,6.167,6.3864,6.8554,8.0111,6.4228,4.4554,1.6671,5.7921,2.1731,4.0955,6.2021,3.3722,5.3657,1.4494,3.1809,6.3193,1.4209,1.7125,4.0165,2.503,4.4356,3.6902,0.9698,15.8253,8.8686,7.7873,8.4233,1.7209,3.427,5.2807,5.4206,0.2312,0.6063,3.1471,2.8748,4.2501,1.7463,4.7778,1.3387,4.2418,3.3165,1.1235,4.2486,0.3102,0.6547,4.3801,2.9167,0.583,4.3414,3.709,0.0371,0.0253,4.8673,0.1989,0.6936,0.0003,5.9746,4.3445,0.0661,2.2515,4.5297,4.118,5.0236,5.2841,1.2161,2.8224,6.205,5.7703,0.3589,4.2564,0.862,1.8326,0.8407,3.1115,3.6187,3.3576,0.0181,1.5249,4.3667,2.2775,2.2358,1.9288,5.4427,1.0517,0.7089,2.8855,0.227,0.1182,1.8061,1.0275,2.2286,2.4743,2.8141,1.6018,3.071,6.0585,1.9719,3.8432,1.6182,3.0678,0.0012,1.6448,4.3489,7.1724,2.8162,8.7713,5.9056,4.8196,7.4919,7.1021,6.9743,4.3356,3.9157,0.2515,4.5036,6.718,2.4575,1.8914,0.9237,4.7961,1.4362,6.3664,5.5363,0.5324,6.3787,3.7655,1.3031,5.4262,2.4178,1.5137,1.3234,4.3705,4.8214,2.9798,0.0012,0.0002,1.7942,6.3603,1.6225,1.7977,3.543,0.9832,5.7522,3.5351,4.827,1.1781,4.1199,0.5189,1.1213,3.0661,3.7964,6.3749,1.7656,1.3512,5.6967,3.3046,0.4432,0.6455,0.0002,1.9994,4.5281,5.4469,5.8376,2.594,2.3699,3.2455,0.6718,0.6746,0.5124,0.8881,1.8698,4.8049,0.0389,3.8918,2.7228,2.7826,1.5785,2.8324,0.162,3.7646,2.922,5.5498,3.2271,0.7244,1.0405,3.7364,0.8416,4.2088,0.0102,0.6096,2.9726,3.6103,2.2217,3.5646,3.0865,1.3285,5.7212,2.2863,0.5056,0.0441,1.7555,5.394,2.2713,4.4564,0.0266,5.3374,5.4105,5.8452,2.1298,3.4626,0.3616,1.4707,5.8062,4.1965,6.9276,1.5714,4.6844,2.7737,7.7866,1.7921]}

Having conducted reconnaissance on their objective during the night of May 12, 1911, the PPCLI commander, Lieutenant General Lenny Johnson, ordered the detachment to reconnoitre the southern border of the Vigovia Canal, the largest in Europe through the Austrian border, and to establish communication with Vigovia so that all supplies could be easily carried out.\n\nOn May 13, 1911, the Vigovia Canal was abandoned and the Spanish\u2013Argentine\u2013Russian blockade of the Vigovia Canal was lifted.\n\nOn 14 May 1911, on the arrival of the Americans, the Vigovia Canal was reopened as a normal line to Vigovia. A new line was opened on the Vigovia Canal on the following October 12.\n\nOn May 13, 1911, in order for the Vigovia Canal to be re-opened, British troops were requested to accompany their troops. The Vigovia Canal was then cleared with the exception of the Vigovia Canal. On May 15, and on May 19, 1911, the line was re-opened without the support of British troops. It reopened safely on September 24, 1911.\n\nAs of early May 1912, Vigovia is the fourth largest crossing crossing in the Western Hemisphere, behind Canc\u00fan and Santiago de Espa\u00f1a.\n\nVigovia, when covered only with Spanish-language Spanish literature, is famous for the Vigovia river-passageways and the large volumes of Spanish literature preserved on these passages. Vigovia is famous for the fact that the Vigovia River crosses over the Vigovia Canal, while covering the Spanish portion.","token_len":381,"entropy":[8.908,1.1129,5.9583,15.7622,16.2263,8.6061,3.6767,2.8171,10.2624,3.3845,8.0692,4.4484,2.8023,3.2847,5.1809,1.3617,10.5616,4.9058,4.2651,8.9914,9.0657,0.7799,2.7269,15.1813,6.7279,2.5763,2.0902,6.0542,6.1863,2.9649,2.5052,4.526,5.3604,4.7725,0.4341,2.4752,1.5782,3.2042,3.414,0.734,7.4391,0.1465,0.8532,2.9021,0.0138,0.0014,6.7529,1.4247,2.6697,2.3175,5.0082,5.3764,5.8249,0.3036,3.2514,1.0973,4.124,0.3138,5.1595,0.045,2.5765,0.0082,1.1925,6.337,3.2155,0.6821,0.9542,5.8211,5.9819,7.6854,2.9403,6.9762,1.9086,3.1797,4.7984,3.5771,3.2155,7.7882,1.7574,7.1115,2.3236,1.6612,1.5769,1.4117,4.2078,3.7095,0.4416,4.7441,0.1796,0.2152,0.3709,7.6288,0.4794,4.4143,5.2178,1.1887,0.1917,5.4953,3.8746,2.0574,0.6636,1.8753,0.166,2.2934,0.9414,1.3743,0.2147,2.5624,0.0669,1.072,3.8834,0.036,0.0121,0.0918,0.7881,0.7239,6.3027,1.6829,0.9531,6.0845,9.1066,6.5877,0.5098,1.0353,4.4316,4.4766,4.0607,1.2545,0.4396,2.5941,0.0338,0.028,0.0929,1.461,1.3012,1.8563,0.5376,2.8916,0.0002,1.5215,8.2629,0.4392,1.8315,0.1596,3.8894,0.5549,6.0749,0.0305,1.0038,5.4611,0.7632,0.9773,2.4835,0.016,0.0052,0.0166,0.5855,0.3527,2.8953,2.996,0.6969,5.9754,5.4516,3.6887,5.4051,0.1101,0.0434,0.04,1.2124,4.1514,3.245,1.7355,0.9867,2.8276,2.1249,1.0393,3.057,0.0232,0.0106,0.0348,0.7691,1.921,1.1729,2.3494,6.8813,5.2267,1.2841,1.1488,0.0002,0.8295,3.085,3.345,0.1088,1.1435,0.0547,3.9321,3.1934,4.3904,0.5158,2.4441,0.0129,0.0045,0.0097,0.3101,0.1005,0.6227,2.8416,0.4633,0.5337,0.5241,5.5074,2.307,1.7553,5.2111,0.2405,6.158,4.0222,3.0771,3.8602,1.6275,2.5864,0.011,0.0054,0.0178,0.2444,0.6106,3.5782,5.0112,5.1745,1.318,3.9811,0.0134,1.0857,3.2626,0.4993,0.0365,0.1348,2.1558,3.0754,2.3819,1.469,1.9839,0.1075,6.0369,2.002,1.1113,3.2123,0.1552,2.7519,0.0652,0.7674,4.954,0.7273,1.8887,0.0622,0.1782,5.7138,1.6715,4.7171,0.0344,1.8051,0.4555,0.3523,4.6832,5.9411,5.6039,0.7258,5.1649,3.6762,0.5417,0.921,0.5573,0.3556,0.0002,5.167,1.867,5.266,3.6426,2.1635,0.1315,4.1289,0.0261,0.007,0.0091,3.5383,1.7822,4.6042,1.663,2.2713,6.719,1.0162,1.5481,3.4706,0.0939,1.3978,4.0509,6.7069,2.8506,2.5211,0.047,1.1775,5.4811,0.6647,11.0839,0.0813,0.0976,0.6017,1.5688,0.0002,2.3445,0.9509,0.0177,0.0137,2.8852,6.0585,7.1409,6.7575,1.7875,6.5072,2.8167,3.9571,5.3818,6.5679,0.2757,0.9985,5.4979,0.2198,2.6018,5.7411,0.2783,0.0342,0.1428,5.516,5.7986,6.7413,3.8454,1.6749,2.0121,1.1693,4.546,7.4225,0.0854,3.6158,2.1539,6.3604,2.0214,4.1339,2.6291,0.2711,3.7628,0.0213,0.0053,0.0156,1.1,4.1392,0.2345,1.3182,2.5204,0.0286,1.5443,2.4968,0.0381,0.0042,0.0477,2.0467,4.3859,2.9817,1.1229,3.0216,0.274,0.0335,0.1005,2.3557,1.624,4.9264,8.4148,1.2479,5.2694,5.5045,4.4229]}

{"id":1219,"ended":true,"length":370,"text":"`` The Stolen Eagle `` was written by executive producer and co @ - @ creator Bruno Heller and directed by Michael Apted, who also directed the following two episodes. Heller said the episode takes center stage in the new series as they work to solve a crime -- \"We all know what happened to the Eagle, but how about that whole mystery around the Horn of the Horn?\"\n\nIn the opening moments, they see her missing with the Eagle. It appears she might be on the street; she will leave behind everything that was she brought into this world.\n\nThe trailer also shows a female and male protagonist, one of whom is dressed like a male protagonist. The female protagonist is shown in front of the Eagle, but the Eagle only sees her in her own eyes.\n\nLater on, as they are walking home, the Eagle looks at them and asks her forgiveness. She responds with 'Why? I've been drinking. What do you want me to do?' She is able to do that and will do that, she says, which may have been more than enough. The Eagle says she is sorry that she did not go to her boyfriend and apologize or accept criticism. She then goes back and takes her time to realize her mistake. She never tells anyone about the rest of her life, but the Eagle is very remorseful.\n\nIn the closing moments of the episode, they see her going home again where she is sitting at her window with her car on the street and when she gets to the next building, it is almost empty. When she gets back to her place she realizes that the only one who is home is that one person (the Eagle) whose name was not said. The Eagle tries to open the door and the Eagle is still there. She tells her forgiveness that this was not her choice, but it was her choice to stay with the boyfriend.","token_len":381,"entropy":[5.5719,8.3257,3.8389,9.2097,9.6001,5.4279,6.4303,0.9695,10.1659,1.2239,3.3772,3.29,15.2361,7.6451,3.1864,8.5424,9.6563,3.6313,2.5484,4.3259,0.0264,3.9885,4.8627,2.7008,2.036,4.1157,1.3491,1.6541,1.7017,1.3221,7.2095,2.9974,1.5549,2.5703,6.4048,4.6311,2.0926,2.4829,5.684,7.5297,0.0119,1.6213,1.0664,5.1817,3.5153,2.9036,4.544,4.2032,0.766,3.5326,1.0974,3.5645,6.2621,3.9419,3.5325,4.2266,1.2876,2.1535,1.4656,0.7362,1.5197,3.8372,1.7824,0.9202,2.9128,4.1281,3.2724,6.0143,5.1719,4.9789,1.0464,7.5487,2.883,2.4971,5.6294,1.1795,2.9009,0.0025,3.5808,1.1052,3.9349,3.9843,1.4388,4.6735,4.0235,5.7661,5.7728,4.3575,2.1773,3.0798,2.8241,3.5619,3.5128,1.7612,5.2732,1.5749,3.6687,1.2538,5.265,5.2762,2.2006,5.7558,4.6792,3.932,7.8574,2.559,2.0298,4.2448,7.2465,3.5875,2.197,0.306,0.5712,2.4342,0.0004,2.0839,6.7184,2.7187,1.8178,1.8567,6.0224,6.2835,0.3363,3.7475,1.5091,4.8612,0.9788,1.1199,1.1274,4.1084,2.5076,1.0364,4.48,4.4324,0.6667,1.8047,2.2653,0.8868,1.1147,3.8444,2.7404,4.0109,0.0093,1.3209,2.2782,1.4645,2.7188,1.9008,3.3565,5.3485,1.6816,0.6033,2.1582,2.1881,3.9684,4.7024,0.3662,0.9292,0.0003,6.4726,1.5121,0.9381,4.4075,2.2801,2.3997,3.4034,4.0848,0.7754,1.4723,1.9154,4.6911,1.4157,1.797,1.2089,2.5056,3.0934,7.175,0.8161,1.7668,3.3774,2.2002,4.9629,4.9397,3.1047,2.1861,3.5994,1.3572,6.2896,2.6745,4.0218,2.5187,0.2786,1.4579,1.7602,0.0083,0.0885,0.7583,2.6376,3.7133,5.4142,0.0046,5.489,2.4256,2.563,5.3168,3.3439,2.7223,3.2861,3.3959,1.3746,1.6086,4.7302,5.6981,2.5448,1.4728,5.7408,2.0662,3.4143,1.9316,2.1783,1.409,3.434,1.5504,2.4268,1.8909,3.3435,0.4865,2.5385,1.1504,4.2982,1.3146,2.7025,4.6982,2.904,5.0026,5.3617,5.0738,8.4574,0.9842,1.5744,2.34,3.162,1.7756,3.0042,3.8407,2.1034,4.0092,2.0133,5.6543,2.7076,0.8636,0.7586,1.9585,5.558,4.9992,1.7755,1.3976,1.5627,6.305,0.0469,1.1352,1.1008,1.4054,1.6403,3.0542,2.0283,2.5633,3.3462,4.3866,0.0004,1.578,0.6643,0.0003,2.2158,0.5626,4.0679,0.3868,1.037,0.2008,0.7495,0.0732,2.4181,2.4134,1.3468,5.2147,2.5405,4.7999,5.6857,0.3683,2.3757,4.4021,2.6672,1.2459,5.8058,2.6672,0.866,5.0014,3.3026,0.7323,2.5444,2.6688,5.852,0.5599,3.0569,2.4325,0.9993,5.0174,4.4575,0.9032,3.4146,0.7879,5.7624,2.6803,0.2633,3.7959,0.9846,2.2309,1.7716,0.779,0.765,4.6267,2.6769,3.0582,1.3246,2.0464,4.4502,4.0166,1.6406,2.1913,2.5246,0.4269,4.4285,2.9548,3.5708,5.9801,2.0543,2.0426,1.2924,5.5136,1.1167,3.1233,2.8783,6.4466,0.793,2.2429,1.2201,4.409,0.1086,5.2624,0.8426,0.3311,2.162,2.6492,2.3591,2.8473,4.1635,1.5902,0.8982,1.7841,3.3766,1.3212,9.4281,3.7234,4.6268,1.9907,1.4837,1.0115,4.0088,1.5601,0.7589,2.9663,1.1127,1.2737,2.5589,2.215,4.1309,2.1092,1.6037,4.3031,1.3699]}

They were all brave men and women who served and made many friends with the world.\"","token_len":381,"entropy":[9.086,5.8015,3.2621,0.5362,6.7931,1.7731,3.4785,0.0501,0.2446,8.5506,1.9891,1.9562,0.2868,4.806,12.9128,9.7215,4.9929,9.5907,8.7953,0.6374,0.0099,4.9311,1.4846,6.2231,5.0504,6.8186,2.9019,14.4546,0.7462,3.6165,9.5703,1.1103,0.0011,2.4105,4.2054,6.2471,4.2279,2.7329,3.4756,4.9043,4.8102,3.629,6.2098,0.0899,1.0075,2.3087,4.9597,1.5663,2.9958,3.7458,6.106,0.2695,4.4664,3.4388,4.6101,0.1651,3.0989,2.3071,5.6594,1.0184,2.4407,4.1123,4.9112,5.7053,3.8794,3.2484,3.3973,4.3892,4.0025,0.8517,3.5504,0.0071,0.1502,1.4172,0.8772,2.5341,2.5074,5.3856,2.4924,4.5037,1.6981,5.3343,1.5682,1.0804,3.3415,6.3434,3.8511,0.3452,5.1344,2.3645,1.5596,6.0338,6.9084,2.5105,0.0275,5.5408,1.763,0.7839,2.2656,0.3721,2.7092,5.0515,0.6737,5.3467,6.7447,1.9394,1.6295,2.5531,2.9018,0.0027,0.0222,0.0041,5.6713,0.048,1.473,0.9516,5.5181,0.0155,2.8016,1.5707,2.6837,1.3757,0.2372,0.4759,0.0446,0.0049,1.619,6.2442,5.6202,0.1338,0.4271,2.6114,0.0065,3.276,2.4054,2.0003,1.0146,4.6616,0.845,5.8385,3.7016,0.0747,4.4951,1.6062,1.7824,0.8143,1.4497,0.0005,2.1773,2.9278,1.6997,1.4234,2.0207,6.075,0.0718,1.5135,2.5394,5.5189,0.8669,6.033,1.292,0.0193,1.2538,1.8689,0.2694,0.2966,0.0284,0.0047,0.8016,5.6452,7.6484,0.5706,1.0856,2.5249,5.9195,2.8616,5.5952,1.9511,1.3172,1.4468,1.5326,0.1204,0.8534,0.9809,3.6322,0.0198,3.8766,1.4693,5.9158,2.1144,2.8136,3.3928,3.5082,2.745,0.3796,4.2262,0.2114,0.5503,0.0004,4.0905,5.3876,0.0629,0.4657,5.001,0.979,3.1833,0.0848,1.1508,1.3217,1.8814,4.7589,0.001,0.0035,0.0037,3.1661,0.0197,1.0021,2.703,4.4954,0.1378,0.4266,0.0582,5.1523,2.7321,4.6481,7.5681,4.317,4.971,0.7885,4.3134,0.1019,0.0038,6.1278,1.9692,2.8283,3.7478,0.3492,0.4448,0.0005,1.8134,1.6188,2.1223,0.7169,0.0793,2.5694,0.0493,3.7428,1.2366,2.5897,1.9115,2.504,1.7786,0.745,0.1408,1.7538,0.013,4.0811,0.4567,4.1457,0.0011,0.6182,1.4466,6.9076,0.8312,0.5509,4.699,0.2584,4.3234,5.7385,4.3177,5.7119,0.6367,0.5225,0.5708,0.0004,1.5917,4.1634,0.0037,1.6351,2.7017,4.6227,3.5484,1.7404,5.9198,1.9557,1.4807,0.9908,0.1934,1.5041,2.7401,3.1072,5.016,0.1065,1.8745,1.7151,2.7916,0.4764,0.4226,1.4248,4.9415,0.1263,3.435,0.1546,0.01,0.4878,2.3526,1.9792,6.5754,1.3982,4.8116,3.0899,0.2379,0.0004,1.7782,1.8138,0.0035,1.0039,6.6252,0.5101,1.4476,0.0531,0.004,0.6846,0.3975,0.6065,2.651,2.552,0.9601,4.2761,0.4849,1.401,5.2309,0.4325,0.8781,3.9176,0.0017,0.0038,0.0047,1.7411,6.1831,0.021,0.0085,5.8706,2.0985,2.4724,1.2903,2.834,0.8057,2.7931,1.6654,3.4073,0.3649,0.1079,0.0027,0.3768,3.8168,0.1515,0.0321,1.474,2.1898,0.6138,0.8841,1.889,3.0615,1.9658,3.3272,2.5424,1.2259,0.1907,0.0119,0.8201,3.1173,1.908,5.3405,6.1097,4.2629,4.8248,1.7523,3.3752,1.3026]}

The soviets were on the move between 1279 and 1279, so soon they needed to change the name of the city, and while a few attempts were made in time to allow the pope to speak at Avignon, Rome decided against it, and the city had lost the title of the capital.\n\nIn 1279, the city was finally saved, and the new Pope Urban VI and the new city of Avignon were proclaimed on 3 March 1290, and in 1290 Pope Urban VI and the new city had become the city of Avignon, and together it was a great cultural success. With all those years of success, the city was gradually reorganized, with a new name, with many new structures, and much effort was made to make Avignon a city for the rest of its life.\n\nDuring this time, Avignon was heavily guarded. The walls of Avignon were often guarded by forces with long arms. As part of a plan for building a new city, and to build a monument where the Avignon Castle, as well as the Avignon Palace and the Avignon Square, were to be erected, more than 300,000 people were required to be allowed to gather together, although almost all members of the city were not present.\n\nBefore the end of the 15th century, this city was also under the control of the Pope. Since the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses, the Pope was able to influence the Pope's government in the kingdom of Avignon, by the way, and the Pope was able to establish the government of Avignon, and it became known as the Avignon Palace.","token_len":381,"entropy":[5.5648,10.3833,8.9536,3.6079,2.1235,2.8559,7.7582,1.8731,3.9012,4.6351,0.1436,7.6257,3.5011,8.9369,2.5977,2.1765,2.4002,2.9745,7.4702,3.1262,2.1253,4.9485,1.2901,2.5062,5.2069,4.5577,1.4902,3.1693,6.3997,5.251,2.6719,12.3759,0.0726,0.0005,0.9771,2.483,7.8589,4.4248,0.0001,1.9117,6.1558,1.4245,3.6669,5.5753,4.2116,3.9651,0.1126,0.3329,3.243,0.8453,5.4002,6.1519,3.4322,6.2526,1.3227,5.2674,1.5393,1.0481,0.7934,0.7482,1.9046,3.0346,1.8268,5.8096,4.8488,2.4281,6.2763,0.6949,0.0918,2.8807,5.1519,1.9551,6.3679,1.4896,2.8702,0.2998,5.7093,3.4787,2.9225,0.0002,0.0017,0.4568,5.2208,4.7597,1.5121,0.8444,1.8741,1.4022,2.3209,2.1192,3.7814,5.2929,2.5077,2.9881,0.6116,2.729,2.0276,0.9755,1.3739,0.0364,2.3835,1.1417,2.3933,0.6251,1.654,2.0041,1.1772,3.8302,4.4562,1.9224,0.9781,1.3725,2.6695,2.7893,4.2358,0.8738,4.8891,1.6903,1.9866,3.6562,2.8031,1.0944,0.0001,0.0012,0.5667,4.0926,3.82,6.1733,2.4098,0.4446,5.4496,1.542,2.1329,3.3656,1.136,2.203,3.4627,0.627,0.6046,3.0236,0.8075,0.589,1.4714,4.429,2.2177,0.6359,3.4908,0.3559,2.8226,0.0006,0.004,2.1122,1.7149,5.0656,6.5435,1.7005,4.9085,3.3892,7.0336,3.9203,0.5271,5.0575,3.9037,4.8496,3.1072,0.5751,2.8751,0.7369,1.3825,0.9456,1.3881,5.261,3.8257,2.1264,1.9997,2.7942,2.1786,1.326,2.9645,1.1482,4.8031,4.1514,1.3912,5.3899,0.8609,0.839,5.5869,7.0871,0.4914,1.5999,0.4519,2.3472,2.4346,0.0003,0.0052,1.4035,2.42,4.6505,1.1818,3.9391,0.0011,3.89,0.9261,0.3135,0.8116,0.0002,4.3374,1.86,0.6223,0.5403,2.8951,0.0011,0.0063,0.8658,6.5554,4.8634,2.7122,1.6612,3.098,1.1325,2.3505,0.0016,0.0027,0.4084,3.6825,3.8545,0.7389,5.5398,5.149,4.3193,2.2176,2.9014,4.027,4.5146,0.0007,2.9275,2.5948,3.0555,4.3852,0.6476,1.2451,1.177,0.4798,5.1676,2.9956,4.7342,0.7891,4.8817,6.2421,0.8054,6.8414,0.0013,0.2658,6.4443,3.9382,3.938,0.9377,0.0021,0.7224,3.7167,0.0022,0.1277,2.5526,2.6359,0.7614,2.4818,0.0019,0.0702,4.4236,0.661,1.3251,0.6483,0.1551,2.8994,0.313,6.3708,0.7553,3.8336,1.8777,0.0026,1.5279,1.0436,3.4811,0.1885,2.47,4.5012,0.503,5.0304,4.1897,2.4201,6.7196,5.9049,0.8166,5.7765,0.1649,0.2319,1.8752,1.6115,3.0239,2.9696,0.7065,1.5948,0.0001,5.9124,0.6079,3.1483,0.0013,0.2153,4.3853,0.0609,0.0728,0.1788,5.0069,2.1054,0.6475,4.2966,3.3481,1.1063,0.9511,0.032,0.8128,4.5854,2.2605,5.273,0.9311,6.3196,0.0017,0.8682,4.2043,0.0758,0.8656,1.5092,0.7721,1.2154,2.5627,2.6363,3.2899,0.0332,5.4216,0.7085,5.1557,1.3252,5.2118,2.2429,2.1561,5.7051,1.5911,1.717,0.0003,0.0025,0.8787,3.5743,4.0871,4.5258,0.9503,1.5873,2.8003,2.0087,1.497,1.2004,0.0346,4.8414,1.7741,4.795,0.9014,0.743,0.0003,0.0048,2.6814,2.011,3.5762,2.0353,1.7413,0.2103,0.5786,4.7687,0.0013,0.1545,1.5813,0.5237]}
{"id":693,"ended":true,"length":347,"text":"Before the modern judicial review procedure superseded the petition of right as the remedy for challenging the validity of a prerogative power, the courts were traditionally only willing to state whether or not powers were relevant to the validity of powers conferred by an individual in a given legal context. The modern jurisprudence, however, is a guide that makes such a transition much easier.\n\nA well-known example of this was the court of appeals decision, Justice Scalia ruled in 1993 against the validity of Executive Order No. 1, which was promulgated by President Woodrow Wilson. The Supreme Court held that because the President of the United States had not abetted illegal acts as part of the executive order, if the president abetted the illegal acts as part of the executive order, the Congress did not legally have to authorize Congress to legislate to declare his executive order unconstitutional. The case was re-examined by the U.S. Supreme Court, where Justice Stephen Breyer opined that \"[f]or the existence of executive orders that do not include any authorization for the exercise of congressional power,\" the Court held that Congress had the right to define the scope or power of executive order in the same way it defined the constitutional scope and power of the powers of legislature and the president.\n\nThis case is a major example of the current judicial precedent in which courts generally ignore the authority of an individual to exercise legislative power in a broad term. In United States v. Brown (1974), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a Federal circuit judge\u2019s refusal to impose a pre-emption on the validity of an executive order, which was challenged in the United States Supreme Court as simply a preemption. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order, which was challenged in the United States Supreme Court in this case as simply a preemption.","token_len":381,"entropy":[2.551,9.4209,10.1467,4.8769,6.295,10.4404,0.1983,0.6315,8.9563,1.9409,7.0445,4.8805,2.5612,4.4588,0.7564,7.0617,1.3608,2.6883,0.0694,1.5004,5.4952,2.678,0.0138,5.3707,0.6886,1.2523,4.016,2.4975,7.3217,5.5923,5.2079,0.0278,7.8463,3.867,2.8559,0.0031,8.9373,1.5007,6.2778,0.6589,0.9412,4.0669,0.08,4.6736,3.0027,0.9047,4.0842,3.2499,4.5998,1.6686,4.1127,5.0752,1.2935,0.3027,2.375,5.8525,5.496,0.197,0.0009,0.0045,2.5862,0.9808,0.0034,2.5437,3.9303,6.347,3.4883,4.5455,3.9933,1.5127,5.9467,4.641,0.7717,0.6023,1.2766,0.0018,3.5235,5.4283,0.2599,1.9276,1.2021,0.6089,0.7455,2.9642,0.9373,5.7543,1.0946,3.5601,3.1966,3.3728,5.7516,4.3886,8.5493,1.0227,5.5525,4.4782,1.4182,5.4005,0.0212,5.6321,1.2969,3.3646,0.016,4.624,0.4117,1.1675,2.8237,4.3342,0.0015,1.1745,0.6663,7.6387,0.0016,0.0018,1.5107,1.3617,3.2564,0.0013,1.8693,0.2765,4.6726,0.9252,2.6448,4.3116,0.0099,0.0133,0.0011,1.3522,3.477,7.1173,7.7552,0.0018,3.9404,1.9602,5.2554,3.8287,0.0011,1.2855,3.6437,0.9066,0.3344,6.8066,1.1947,3.7828,5.6598,0.4889,0.0027,2.1406,1.8213,0.2815,2.4174,0.4939,0.0006,0.6276,0.6238,0.0041,0.2392,1.1092,4.6222,4.2961,0.063,8.7603,0.5163,2.0134,3.11,3.0721,0.1309,4.4674,0.021,3.0025,6.8864,4.6859,3.4451,2.3392,0.6497,0.2114,1.6661,3.997,1.5216,5.2832,0.4498,2.1344,0.0022,0.0011,1.3436,0.6984,3.6828,0.0008,0.0174,0.0019,0.7559,0.0026,1.8987,3.5188,0.7069,3.8029,0.1935,0.0001,6.9312,0.0032,0.4653,3.0031,3.9239,0.0458,0.8682,1.3068,4.579,0.0773,4.6113,1.5445,2.4877,3.1693,0.1453,5.2028,3.7149,5.6132,0.9817,1.6084,4.5758,0.0828,4.5531,0.9891,4.3916,0.9411,1.8644,2.0091,0.2567,2.5423,1.2227,1.6258,2.8415,0.1867,4.3059,1.1693,2.5727,6.6964,5.3552,0.2453,2.1124,2.2242,3.3242,1.7148,4.2232,0.3592,2.249,0.8332,0.5696,4.0884,3.2845,2.443,0.1797,0.1009,1.0611,5.4699,1.7236,8.0374,3.1733,1.2396,1.9874,0.5599,1.153,0.0001,3.0225,2.215,2.1473,2.6116,4.3053,1.34,0.0644,1.0182,5.3031,2.3977,5.1459,2.8996,1.6828,3.8169,5.3611,4.9762,0.993,4.0652,0.1323,4.2881,0.2609,0.9257,1.3435,3.0034,0.5664,2.391,1.356,6.3009,8.0834,1.0469,2.1628,5.3802,0.0066,0.0023,0.015,5.6696,3.1012,4.3464,0.1061,0.6264,3.0514,0.0007,0.0072,0.0011,1.4778,0.009,0.0018,0.0311,0.0025,2.8579,0.0039,3.187,1.3583,5.1544,5.2855,2.2124,15.2374,10.587,5.6089,4.0389,0.0403,5.0101,1.0443,3.5096,0.9005,1.8822,2.4914,1.0874,4.7517,0.0238,2.4289,1.0801,0.0727,2.606,3.0789,1.6871,3.6867,1.5921,1.4862,3.3904,0.0066,1.3085,0.0025,3.9921,7.5903,1.6833,2.1091,1.1093,1.9067,0.792,4.5207,0.0028,5.0309,0.6249,0.3105,0.0057,3.2406,0.7589,5.1683,1.1171,3.203,1.3948,2.9816,0.9284,0.6082,2.1758,0.0059,0.4452,0.004,2.9364,4.688,0.3158,2.3387,2.7566,0.2917,0.3438,0.2496,0.6865]}

That win allowed Halep to overtake Serena Williams as the world number one player by a full tournament.\n\nThe second-grader also reached the quarterfinals in Melbourne, where her fourth-round exit means that Halep has lost only one grand slam for her entire career.\n\nIn addition to this, Halep has six matches left at Melbourne Park, where she will take on Australia's Ash Barty in one of the grand slam finals.\n\nHalep, who also qualified for the last 18 major finals with the title at the Australian Open, and Barty both reached the quarterfinals in the same year.\n\nHalep is the world number one of all time and the first major champion since Serena Williams at the Australian Open in 2013.","token_len":381,"entropy":[2.8006,11.6418,3.0446,0.0229,8.6527,5.3559,0.6293,2.8064,1.5241,5.8233,5.6187,3.8534,0.1993,0.0216,0.903,1.3649,0.0056,0.0039,4.8203,1.7129,4.6757,4.3182,0.1257,0.3537,2.6691,0.9122,1.8197,0.0021,3.3506,4.4144,0.001,2.5891,2.1206,1.4325,5.9839,0.2228,2.9129,3.7365,0.7812,3.0977,0.0007,3.8532,0.1185,0.0033,0.0034,2.0776,3.4245,4.7259,2.031,0.7831,4.1421,1.645,1.4279,0.9227,0.0002,2.5801,3.1711,6.8901,3.4279,5.0349,2.217,5.6637,0.5854,0.984,0.0068,0.0037,2.639,1.5353,5.962,3.0888,0.0001,8.9503,0.8096,0.0004,1.7549,0.4984,1.2316,3.9898,5.0659,0.0079,3.3401,2.4683,3.0033,0.1146,0.621,1.4858,0.0002,3.1563,0.0029,5.5423,1.7225,5.4468,4.2621,0.8246,3.1773,1.0001,0.0002,5.4753,0.8657,0.9034,7.0118,7.8686,5.6065,5.7296,5.1192,0.4544,5.2939,0.0003,0.4246,2.5776,3.0844,0.0127,2.9344,1.7816,6.4902,1.6105,0.0198,3.2138,3.4269,3.3502,0.8997,1.8012,0.1291,0.888,1.0052,0.0002,5.3849,2.7585,0.0178,0.0035,2.046,2.0926,0.0005,3.3067,2.3042,1.0133,0.292,0.013,3.3123,5.8953,3.3848,5.0253,2.718,7.185,0.0211,1.2,0.2154,3.7069,2.7405,2.5233,5.2583,0.6025,2.5596,1.8922,2.4142,3.3411,3.3334,0.7952,5.4266,1.6337,4.0,5.1639,4.2047,2.4028,1.538,3.3215,1.7107,1.4459,6.2642,0.9277,0.2952,0.0001,4.519,0.858,2.4441,2.0939,0.1649,1.9902,0.9599,3.0075,1.657,0.0003,6.5301,2.635,0.0002,3.6305,0.5494,9.8847,0.675,0.0198,0.0019,4.5405,5.4551,0.121,4.5782,0.8065,0.0002,4.351,1.8476,5.6987,0.9268,1.2046,0.9334,0.094,0.5661,1.2981,0.0014,2.0485,0.7445,0.5411,0.0201,2.0757,2.615,6.3889,0.7891,2.6604,2.6677,5.1513,0.0347,0.0039,0.0409,0.0796,2.296,4.4969,0.3584,4.2547,2.2876,4.2633,1.1783,0.0005,0.1162,5.4407,4.2387,0.0018,0.0408,1.7547,0.1361,2.4172,2.6715,0.2064,2.6795,3.7089,1.2284,3.8738,5.5004,1.0739,0.5353,0.0001,2.8145,4.9709,1.4035,6.6586,0.0049,4.4547,4.8856,0.3568,3.8441,0.2577,2.4189,6.4534,1.6177,2.241,3.1887,5.0608,1.2568,1.9987,6.0148,6.2605,2.1619,1.9302,0.0007,1.9076,5.7247,3.0797,1.0852,3.0361,0.0219,5.3222,2.0782,5.2443,0.3272,0.2259,0.3823,0.0001,3.7043,3.261,0.7886,3.3285,0.6695,0.9095,0.0008,1.2961,5.9368,5.7046,3.9925,3.8768,6.4815,5.5732,1.4638,2.6398,0.1807,1.8701,3.3799,0.1381,6.2412,0.4189,7.4045,13.8565,5.6798,1.4199,4.7979,0.2017,0.322,3.6766,0.8877,1.1005,0.9515,0.3231,0.0001,2.418,0.0009,2.8241,0.7003,3.3492,5.4632,0.249,0.3683,5.376,5.24,3.3604,4.0756,3.8903,1.7006,6.6038,3.7637,1.1483,2.4517,0.0514,0.7912,5.2698,2.5328,0.0024,4.4551,4.1744,0.2144,1.2197,0.0632,1.0422,2.5382,2.5853,1.4493,0.6975,0.2992,0.0001,2.2122,0.0009,2.0315,1.5211,5.2658,0.763,0.1769,6.1518,2.3237,1.3808,2.2142,2.1147,2.5828,6.1649,3.1986,3.0506,3.0291,0.0009,0.1265,4.0918,0.7915,1.8396,0.0188,0.7321,4.8969,0.1353]}

Lawrence also tells the story of a man who got caught in a wildfire, where he managed not only to break free as he escaped, but he also managed to save himself from his mother and three brothers \u2014 and survived the blaze with the help of a paramedic.\n\n\"We use animation in many ways, but the animation that we make in the movies is actually really really good, and animation is really important for people because you can use that as a platform to develop characters,\" Lawrence, a former firefighter, told The Telegraph. \"This is a real example of how animation can work, as long as you know exactly what you are trying to accomplish, and you don't use it to make fun of the characters.\"\n\n\"He came down at sea, and this was another example of a guy out there and just trying to do his part,\" Lawrence continued.\n\nThe show also stars David Hasselbeck and Matt Damon.\n\nA film about Leonard and his life (from \"Star Wars: the Animated Series'')\n\n\"Everybody has something to say about Leonard and the adventures he's experienced,\" said co-star Matt Damon, who first appeared in the 1994 film ''Star Wars.''","token_len":381,"entropy":[9.3514,6.6526,8.5029,1.8281,2.754,1.9116,5.8158,7.1019,8.5221,5.2336,2.7883,5.1143,7.7666,6.1199,1.5532,1.8779,1.9331,3.1106,0.3731,7.5847,8.051,0.9391,1.1324,2.6053,7.2826,0.0052,0.9395,11.8832,11.5416,0.2271,7.1104,4.0796,1.8588,3.2916,2.7382,7.52,0.1669,1.438,5.9415,0.0108,5.5346,6.2996,2.3345,4.262,1.0327,0.4252,3.0374,5.1738,0.1989,8.4027,3.1605,3.8625,1.6209,4.8303,5.1808,4.6632,1.5271,2.3627,4.7969,0.9695,2.0803,5.4113,1.8132,2.5784,4.7497,3.4705,3.9154,2.626,1.37,4.2841,6.5833,1.1225,2.7108,3.2382,2.8281,1.6409,0.0004,3.1598,4.6597,3.9825,3.8019,4.8639,3.746,2.1991,0.8077,5.2026,4.0697,2.7939,6.6087,0.0636,0.131,0.055,0.0019,0.7815,0.8892,4.7737,0.3749,5.262,2.6269,7.1583,5.5292,3.5331,2.3551,3.7787,6.2461,4.9007,1.0303,0.9364,3.4458,1.4532,3.4927,0.6698,2.9845,1.6953,1.7139,5.4636,1.4041,4.3789,0.0223,0.6897,4.2588,4.863,3.4141,0.7228,0.359,1.1782,2.0859,4.2913,2.7719,2.3352,2.7995,0.2122,3.8106,2.3686,3.266,1.451,3.8441,3.9717,3.5237,0.6205,0.3052,0.0669,1.7705,2.9671,0.4454,4.3235,3.5575,1.3623,0.643,7.0147,1.9521,4.7016,0.5556,5.0301,6.1242,2.0696,0.023,5.3963,1.5651,6.741,1.5477,5.9238,1.2186,0.0194,4.0541,1.0366,1.9062,0.0285,3.0538,2.4917,1.4815,4.5888,5.2388,2.5303,5.2324,1.9583,6.1289,2.3365,5.3008,2.2418,1.7009,3.5489,2.4347,0.1465,0.0025,1.3372,6.3645,0.0084,0.5378,0.7829,0.0002,3.303,2.5133,6.2398,5.9825,3.2394,3.2211,1.8216,1.3225,1.0737,2.7137,3.8752,2.1637,0.8243,3.0541,2.5652,1.5894,4.1146,0.7712,4.0622,2.9779,4.9175,1.6528,2.0059,1.3516,6.9953,1.0982,1.7232,1.4825,1.9784,3.6616,4.127,2.8833,1.4059,4.2355,2.5646,2.6516,0.6015,4.4835,0.8978,4.8645,3.3307,1.8321,1.2459,5.5167,2.9179,2.4446,4.5808,0.5629,1.2,2.3116,3.8831,0.3926,0.8728,4.5784,0.7112,1.4451,4.0149,4.4852,0.1855,1.1466,3.1692,0.7898,4.4775,2.3405,3.799,3.6187,0.0164,0.7213,3.835,5.1197,0.3015,0.8272,2.5051,2.1973,0.0058,3.0291,2.3381,0.6212,1.836,2.1683,0.0007,4.5183,1.1941,1.4333,2.3717,4.0338,0.1924,2.4844,1.6533,1.2693,0.3323,0.0002,3.8169,5.0348,4.5966,3.8235,4.2633,3.874,1.5558,0.9671,4.6417,2.5036,5.9903,2.9155,0.2351,3.1224,2.8364,6.5632,0.7096,5.2515,4.3506,1.5765,0.0403,2.4651,1.7055,3.1134,1.222,1.258,1.6391,0.1652,3.2323,0.0002,2.1072,5.6726,2.6181,2.8844,4.3891,5.8196,0.0007,5.845,2.1048,4.8066,0.5572,1.6504,1.529,0.0002,4.0176,6.2588,2.4388,8.2041,3.3387,1.6381,2.7727,4.7089,4.5567,4.1545,4.6735,2.0159,1.2747,7.0103,7.0057,0.0312,2.1377,1.8135,4.388,0.0002,2.8517,6.6175,2.8222,4.4243,1.0702,0.6083,0.369,2.7883,1.8858,2.2742,6.0979,0.8722,1.5842,6.0807,1.9738,1.2344,5.2842,0.014,2.9356,3.3161,0.0042,0.9338,0.3803,6.0977,1.7756,0.3159,0.8343,5.0136,1.4823,2.2605,2.792,0.2049,1.3981]}
{"id":2763,"ended":true,"length":325,"text":"In the theory of general relativity, there is time dilation within a gravitational well. This is known as the gravitational redshift or Einstein Shift. The theoretical derivation of this effect follows from the idea that the redshift between the first and second states of a space is an error, and no such black hole, unlike the neutron or zemo events in time, can exist in the first and second states. A black hole can be observed with the gravitational wave (GWA ). The Einstein shift has existed for a while, and hence can be compared to this shift.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Ardler formula (or Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s law), for g-energy theory of general relativity predicts that the black hole observed in the video has a time Dilation of the black hole as close as 20 minutes after its transmission in the video was stopped at a known time. The Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Ardler formula predicts that the black hole in the video is more black and that the number of redshifts is equal to the number of redshifts. The Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Ardler law predicts that the black hole in the video has only time dilation. Then, the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s law predicts that the black hole in the video has no time dilation, but that the video can continue to produce redshift energy within 2.3 seconds. If the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s law is correct, there exists a time dilation between the black hole in the video and its transmission in the video. If the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s law is false, both black holes (like the black hole in the video) need to be discovered in time to recover their energy. If these two events take place, both black holes (like the black hole in the video) need to be discovered in time.","token_len":381,"entropy":[2.6222,10.2368,0.8929,6.5018,0.0906,0.2116,3.0229,0.8259,8.7132,5.8262,0.008,5.6911,1.3866,4.6704,5.8805,1.0905,2.1972,1.2481,2.9804,0.0771,0.9793,3.4885,10.0939,0.0398,4.1356,7.1854,10.3404,0.4122,1.8013,7.0114,7.7533,0.055,0.3208,1.1065,3.4801,5.8769,1.1391,0.7615,4.0813,0.4664,1.3817,2.6374,0.0509,5.264,1.2509,4.2385,0.8143,0.4219,6.0686,0.5908,1.2885,5.1946,1.8335,4.6406,5.6385,3.1639,1.5575,6.2873,3.2585,5.7556,0.7603,4.8802,5.0826,1.1842,6.5755,6.2741,6.7287,13.4693,7.1897,2.8156,6.3404,0.4751,1.3601,1.8871,1.7569,1.1761,1.531,2.0929,0.2035,0.3168,0.6836,4.158,2.0485,0.0127,2.7517,2.0557,2.9107,3.0367,1.8188,4.08,5.3402,4.5891,1.3939,4.2576,10.841,1.6352,5.414,2.3508,4.5234,6.362,0.8662,2.431,3.1261,0.8822,1.7207,7.0076,3.7399,0.3654,4.9521,0.6068,3.199,5.7302,0.9471,1.7909,0.0493,1.6274,8.9877,0.0066,0.0007,0.0,5.0422,9.6525,6.3642,7.2262,5.3233,2.6385,3.9506,1.4858,0.0092,0.0201,0.0096,12.3281,10.5132,5.1401,3.263,3.6428,3.8425,7.6398,3.3831,3.8241,5.714,3.2201,2.0573,0.0137,7.618,0.4726,1.1192,3.2055,0.0577,5.4776,1.074,0.747,6.5658,5.2967,0.8806,4.8141,5.0678,4.9382,0.6342,4.7061,2.7081,0.0348,4.1076,5.4105,1.4378,5.0863,5.1736,2.1189,2.2168,9.1611,3.6359,0.5739,2.5082,6.1685,3.5391,4.3999,2.3779,5.6132,2.1023,0.7772,1.6075,4.4372,0.0016,0.0005,0.0034,1.3444,0.0081,0.002,0.0008,2.1152,3.0026,0.2539,0.6862,0.4685,0.0016,3.3972,0.3478,0.1099,1.4366,5.1185,5.4746,3.9083,3.4499,1.1838,6.0503,0.1037,4.5448,2.1763,0.0655,2.1964,4.0779,0.0744,0.7838,1.1536,0.0181,2.6773,0.3272,0.0016,3.8191,1.566,2.9537,0.002,0.0009,0.0073,0.0589,0.0034,0.0034,0.0008,2.4355,2.1508,0.1482,0.5223,0.607,0.0094,1.0398,0.0443,0.0384,2.0472,4.6457,6.6311,0.533,0.0006,4.0542,7.5051,0.8226,1.3025,4.0455,0.0012,0.0009,0.02,6.2036,0.0458,0.0978,0.2813,0.6737,0.1429,0.338,0.3386,0.0023,0.5807,0.0243,0.0324,0.9038,2.7623,0.4219,0.1579,0.0003,1.9423,2.3032,1.5612,0.7049,6.6406,3.7319,3.9507,0.6448,4.707,2.2313,3.3915,5.2414,4.8671,4.6492,1.838,2.78,1.2207,0.8548,3.5059,0.7895,2.6483,0.0029,0.0008,0.0121,0.2557,0.0029,0.0116,0.2973,1.3402,0.5641,0.1344,3.7431,5.2267,0.5942,1.7639,0.6453,0.0019,3.1846,0.8276,2.4195,0.0279,1.3695,0.074,0.0633,0.1039,2.7082,1.8684,1.4219,0.4738,0.1078,0.4,1.8586,0.5956,0.3005,0.0064,0.0012,0.0152,0.0116,0.0015,0.003,0.0458,0.0876,2.9941,0.0305,6.9142,1.7537,0.1472,4.8004,4.2718,0.7622,2.4677,0.1415,0.5253,0.2473,0.2235,0.2073,5.8084,0.4629,1.1789,6.0459,1.9429,3.1693,2.1751,8.7719,0.9935,1.7816,0.7355,2.4972,4.1728,1.498,2.4363,4.874,0.1304,2.0099,3.9517,0.539,0.033,2.1488,0.2126,0.123,0.0716,0.0027,0.0238,0.0193,0.0206,0.0191,1.4355,0.1241,0.3226,0.7772,0.6177,0.306,2.5363]}

Keane became interested in the idea of directing young people into fairy tales, and decided to create stories he wrote that would be \"fun, action packed, and animated, while being a little bit edgy.\" He later worked with Peter Drucker and David Cronenberg, and later worked for an animated film called ``Merry Christmas'' which was released in 2000.\n\nIn 1992, Keane co-created and produced \"The Fantastical,\" a Disney classic about the rise of evil, and it featured \"the Fairy Tales of My Little Pony\" cartoon characters like Cinderella and the Count of Monte Cristo. The Fantastical won a Tony Award for Animation as Best Animation at the 1996 Golden Globe Award for Best Visuals. Keane, who received his acting degrees from Columbia University and the University of California, San Diego, worked on various animated films for Sony Pictures Animation and had previously directed in 2002's \"The Dark Knight,\" which debuted theatrically. Keane also directed \"The Hunger Games\" for Disney in 2006.\n\nLast year, Keane began directing for the second and third time in his career and he announced the new project as a \"super-ficci project,\" which is a sequel to \"The Fantastical\" which was his predecessor. Keane worked on ''Gimlet Man'' for the 2006 Sundance Film Festival in the United States and \"The Little Mermaid: The Tale of the Little Mermaid's Princess.\" During his nine years working on ''Gimlet Man'' the film was made and released in both European and U.S. theaters by DreamWorks Animation and in the United Kingdom by Biodontology Ltd. A major film development for this animated project was the release of a new theatrical script for \"The Little Mermaid.\"","token_len":382,"entropy":[8.3388,7.6761,3.8294,0.3796,7.0698,4.06,6.5445,6.1278,0.1372,5.8746,1.1001,6.9332,0.1018,13.8675,15.131,0.1577,0.0,4.1726,3.8751,5.1348,4.2499,0.1794,2.8381,2.2467,0.5324,2.5367,1.4326,2.1341,3.9577,0.3509,5.8446,4.7964,3.0628,0.0632,0.8118,3.1897,1.2512,6.1287,7.9467,3.4209,2.105,3.5632,0.3108,1.9078,0.9805,3.977,0.2704,2.7691,6.8087,4.629,6.1374,4.0129,1.5685,2.0689,4.5205,4.2619,2.6324,6.3332,2.8526,0.5947,0.7158,5.707,3.1912,4.6862,3.5738,3.5385,1.7626,1.265,6.5225,0.1091,1.354,1.9498,4.6537,3.1721,1.4085,4.5624,5.1321,0.5008,2.183,4.1189,3.0349,0.0002,2.6154,1.2193,3.091,3.6387,4.0251,5.7431,1.4259,1.5937,1.5891,1.5861,5.1705,3.8811,0.1129,2.0437,2.407,1.3054,2.2152,0.3076,2.955,0.2724,2.2173,0.0691,2.2227,5.3134,0.5142,1.113,5.071,0.036,2.8471,2.1908,2.2107,4.1227,1.6545,7.1768,2.5687,3.8944,0.8572,3.3333,4.9435,1.771,1.8173,4.5608,0.3231,3.8694,2.1836,1.8706,4.1517,5.0641,5.1413,3.0052,6.2639,2.8332,0.3853,6.2834,2.8229,0.0775,1.3443,3.8923,1.9387,5.5609,6.3459,0.8338,2.4945,6.763,1.9643,0.0131,0.0372,0.0012,0.5661,2.1924,5.4564,0.0079,5.5491,1.9222,3.7515,0.4907,0.6234,5.8371,6.5991,2.409,3.6666,2.877,0.2899,2.6759,4.8661,1.0896,4.2383,1.1895,0.5569,4.0811,5.0883,0.8438,2.0875,4.2445,0.813,4.9703,2.0106,4.7401,4.0839,0.3124,3.3378,0.4684,0.7395,1.2987,0.7801,0.0035,2.0098,0.6073,2.8722,0.3727,0.1077,2.9984,0.9288,4.4358,2.088,1.266,2.6411,5.6508,0.4388,1.1891,1.6765,5.5317,3.0804,2.0967,5.4366,7.5686,1.6045,2.14,1.8958,5.4781,0.5201,3.3145,2.6797,4.8295,7.8407,0.0124,0.0001,2.594,2.5863,2.1247,1.4463,1.9235,1.3499,5.5144,0.011,2.2048,2.0222,1.1387,2.2096,2.9533,0.783,0.6588,0.0002,6.7441,0.7462,0.2015,0.5832,3.9357,2.7898,4.2511,1.9757,4.7563,4.0856,1.2386,5.0815,1.9645,1.5403,0.7463,3.4632,3.147,3.5817,2.4996,4.1535,1.2427,3.0248,1.7284,3.5402,5.6786,2.1831,4.3936,3.1838,10.7999,6.9438,2.1875,2.0966,2.2452,2.6939,3.5991,0.1399,2.2673,0.9108,2.466,0.007,1.757,2.8101,1.7922,4.9202,6.7181,2.6258,1.8338,5.6958,0.6226,6.353,4.6763,5.0929,3.185,5.5244,0.758,2.2372,3.3424,6.8614,4.3917,0.0004,0.1101,0.0024,3.9146,3.7374,1.9063,0.1603,0.9734,2.779,1.4868,4.554,0.1514,3.5097,1.9167,4.6885,0.0198,1.9078,2.576,0.0017,4.8683,2.9081,4.8746,6.2848,1.4941,6.6348,0.7677,3.04,0.4689,3.4004,1.3314,0.0455,0.0061,0.0293,1.7521,3.8757,3.2337,1.946,4.3399,4.7334,3.0043,1.233,5.0475,5.6767,0.2474,3.1655,0.0008,0.0324,0.0789,0.2607,4.7383,5.0035,0.3105,0.2541,2.238,6.2316,2.0623,1.742,0.4103,0.3542,4.877,8.0126,5.9334,8.1766,4.7012,0.2889,5.1391,5.5037,5.1784,5.9474,2.1931,4.6429,4.8285,2.3286,0.732,1.0874,2.6689,0.12,2.1064,2.3224,5.6663,7.1386,1.3435,1.7783,0.8589,1.4744,0.0132,2.3815]}

However, as a result of their plight, the former and the latter groups, who were the most vulnerable to the \"Isid-Hasreal\" conflict and the 1948 Palestinian victory, have been subjected to serious repression, discrimination, and violence for the first time since the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict.","token_len":382,"entropy":[9.5686,1.3312,6.0872,5.8738,5.9414,3.1987,5.7183,0.438,1.266,6.5547,0.8357,3.1755,3.0868,3.6585,0.3599,3.2418,2.8895,5.0586,1.209,11.4426,0.2074,15.2864,5.6331,3.2475,6.5387,3.7909,0.2491,3.6303,2.995,17.131,6.9052,6.7024,5.3932,2.9697,1.9159,5.4234,1.3042,5.2477,4.4556,6.5228,0.4007,0.2491,3.2296,0.9011,3.4838,6.3012,1.1458,2.5488,2.956,2.274,1.1051,2.9817,0.6361,2.3538,2.5406,4.809,0.1546,4.6936,2.4382,4.5239,1.6839,0.0046,0.4984,3.1372,5.9323,4.5935,0.9819,4.8297,0.163,2.9128,4.0406,0.7711,3.3782,5.4245,2.8713,4.2151,2.4864,3.0893,0.6282,4.0236,3.4136,6.386,6.3695,0.777,6.0109,1.4922,0.4555,2.7073,3.075,0.7426,3.7222,0.092,0.0074,2.2373,3.2139,1.7498,4.1413,2.7817,5.4453,5.9031,0.0256,4.9673,6.4854,2.7285,7.1403,3.9624,0.7269,0.5271,0.5609,3.237,1.1041,1.9432,0.0145,0.0019,0.8076,4.6109,0.5804,2.9132,3.6558,0.9522,1.6316,1.5652,2.4528,1.6544,4.1275,1.5232,5.2391,5.8053,0.099,5.9285,6.0848,1.3006,1.6398,2.6348,1.5861,5.8859,1.4921,2.2798,4.9068,2.0695,0.0476,1.4393,5.1964,2.3766,0.0876,1.8155,2.7605,1.2756,2.1065,2.4844,4.1697,0.4745,0.3385,0.8105,0.918,6.1877,0.8518,0.9626,0.7717,4.0253,5.3488,0.8131,1.2342,5.2627,5.1522,3.9419,2.1056,0.5414,2.7453,2.0505,1.5289,4.7715,1.4336,2.7515,1.2466,0.5364,0.2151,6.6718,0.0395,2.8636,0.7141,0.6693,2.2348,4.1283,4.4528,0.7858,2.1052,0.4295,0.4738,4.6769,7.1678,5.624,5.4719,5.3742,6.7361,3.4568,3.3297,2.4352,3.6539,1.5099,4.1396,2.1403,0.7783,0.0282,1.3609,1.9066,4.2898,0.6043,3.8424,1.3232,2.0338,1.0349,5.8369,2.8438,0.9311,0.6086,0.5129,0.1467,0.3896,3.8778,3.3032,0.2892,3.8475,3.4371,0.0951,0.1485,5.8621,7.4747,0.3736,1.8361,2.4932,1.0889,0.6761,4.5732,3.5418,0.0022,2.1085,4.4653,0.2914,2.3623,0.7168,0.9156,5.6975,5.5562,5.109,4.7611,6.4639,0.4478,6.4072,1.2875,4.0669,4.5104,7.2836,1.6401,2.6387,2.8159,2.9558,0.063,1.1944,0.7288,3.504,4.4663,3.9096,0.8275,4.5509,0.9389,2.7717,4.0658,3.4736,1.1254,5.922,0.5231,1.588,0.016,4.3996,0.9781,4.1004,0.6753,0.1888,1.6376,0.0847,2.0593,4.9273,6.0354,0.9712,3.936,1.6272,2.1481,4.0703,4.2006,1.5385,3.0065,2.2604,0.2588,0.1419,0.0459,6.6499,2.2896,4.8634,0.2565,1.1632,4.3725,0.4407,0.7246,0.0302,0.0364,1.85,0.041,1.9335,4.5415,0.1228,6.2865,2.8877,3.2413,3.8965,0.7301,2.9026,0.7551,4.4166,1.7064,1.5527,4.1009,0.0434,3.3176,2.0629,0.297,0.1866,2.7408,4.434,0.2209,0.867,6.4873,5.3162,1.3369,0.3896,5.166,3.478,3.1294,1.2512,3.5936,2.273,2.9072,1.8932,1.4211,4.1056,1.0421,0.0247,0.0834,1.4611,0.0253,0.1497,3.1068,2.3923,2.0263,6.49,4.344,7.5207,0.5252,4.2587,1.1092,5.0018,0.0184,5.2494,3.5893,1.7295,4.0608,1.2597,1.9609,2.3508,3.4222,1.4832,4.2828,0.1467,1.0694,0.9984,2.2781,0.8335,0.1739,0.0131,2.6865,1.0052]}

The program, which brings together Oxford professors, university and civil society experts, students, and university faculty and staff, aims to \"provide a safe alternative to traditional academic experience\" for students.\n\"We believe that we are the first global university to pursue this goal, and that we are the first institution in the world to provide a university with a research and development program designed for students of all ages, backgrounds, and generations to improve the well-being and resilience of their lives,\" a statement said.\nIFCD describes these programs as research and development activities aimed at \"creating a future capable of enabling students who are not only academically inclined but also socially intelligent\".\nMore to come","token_len":382,"entropy":[6.3998,5.4587,6.5616,8.4964,4.887,2.0974,7.5188,1.4054,1.6819,11.6255,1.1484,15.5627,13.6759,11.0265,6.2412,4.9489,9.3505,4.4932,3.1788,0.7212,6.06,6.1746,6.7997,1.1014,6.717,3.9153,0.8796,0.0,0.6471,4.6549,0.9516,5.3514,2.0681,4.6613,0.1467,5.9336,0.9456,4.832,1.4219,1.7625,3.2948,6.1804,0.5707,0.6758,1.3059,2.1869,2.2466,5.145,7.6455,0.9783,15.7472,0.0075,1.8176,5.8562,2.0597,1.4179,5.6821,0.0058,1.8409,1.2028,4.397,1.846,1.9429,2.99,6.0712,1.4102,0.3899,6.3889,1.4194,3.9454,0.0021,3.1778,1.3064,2.6421,1.8221,2.2653,3.8671,5.8829,1.8351,4.0982,2.8626,2.4608,2.2537,5.7367,1.8015,5.238,3.4305,7.4656,5.3331,1.8127,4.0514,0.033,5.777,0.7921,5.1284,3.0202,3.1801,1.0605,2.2398,7.1477,0.8267,1.0265,3.6237,0.0019,1.1684,4.2327,1.3729,2.4653,1.0501,1.9972,5.92,0.003,5.6354,2.0662,3.0751,3.688,5.6857,1.8628,1.5324,2.1622,1.7967,2.8535,2.3616,5.0962,3.7157,5.9697,0.006,6.6313,1.9998,0.0599,3.9734,3.9277,0.9886,0.1,1.8558,5.4537,4.0022,0.5064,1.4838,2.1402,3.98,0.2648,4.2205,1.1507,1.0068,0.0134,0.2591,3.6598,1.6075,3.5398,2.9293,4.9922,4.6404,2.8694,2.9173,2.2755,0.01,1.2596,0.1376,0.2605,1.9893,4.1363,4.3339,1.3391,4.0906,0.149,1.6046,2.5261,4.3824,3.6006,1.4204,5.3052,3.266,3.1457,0.157,1.177,5.0239,3.3532,0.7486,2.5432,2.3678,5.1259,5.6932,3.7545,2.3527,1.4965,4.9571,3.6132,4.5186,1.2373,0.4428,4.4019,0.0029,3.5478,0.4343,0.0725,6.6006,1.8991,3.4004,1.5184,0.1922,2.9445,0.0064,2.5753,0.356,2.7391,4.4574,4.6643,2.7364,0.2008,0.8115,0.1045,9.1862,0.0608,1.7084,2.0183,1.011,2.6742,2.6543,4.218,0.7155,5.9398,4.7303,1.5248,1.2939,0.8951,4.0322,2.7907,4.117,1.9916,4.4621,2.6571,0.3993,2.6726,1.1221,0.8368,1.1405,1.8327,4.0381,1.8546,1.4012,1.7427,1.8679,1.4731,7.1843,0.3383,4.6993,4.3107,0.9651,4.175,4.5052,6.8753,0.219,2.375,0.5419,5.6757,0.3251,0.5597,4.6682,3.4845,4.0737,1.3323,0.3761,2.4993,0.0494,2.5472,2.793,0.0072,1.8737,3.8919,6.0035,0.1892,2.9935,1.7081,5.2376,3.7161,1.8766,1.0019,2.0634,0.8445,3.049,2.2246,2.1383,0.5005,3.8883,1.8204,2.9267,1.5979,4.2328,1.1113,0.6445,5.1381,2.2917,3.478,1.8766,0.5554,2.3574,1.7544,1.303,2.971,0.6529,3.7458,1.1946,0.1357,0.0599,0.2738,3.485,1.4988,4.5213,3.3755,0.9323,3.6265,0.3515,0.4242,1.2831,3.9405,2.3386,1.6824,2.8609,0.3272,1.2147,1.6981,0.6835,0.411,0.2339,8.1294,2.7255,4.6791,2.7092,5.444,0.0877,0.0008,2.1691,6.5014,0.0112,0.7025,1.1153,0.5401,4.631,0.6804,2.1805,0.2485,0.5385,3.3152,0.0079,0.0012,6.3397,5.0556,1.7123,0.1032,5.7739,0.6268,0.2629,3.7778,2.784,0.0585,1.9624,3.2072,0.015,1.413,4.8371,7.543,0.0085,5.3137,1.8054,4.6888,1.4224,3.184,3.7895,3.311,0.0021,3.091,0.6502,0.5016,1.6882,5.3867,7.1998,0.94,6.6544,4.5036,0.9726]}

In 1980, Walter L. Mertens set forth a punctuation form, or ''nose'' for short. In 1988, Norman W. Woldman, Jr. set forth a punctuation form which used ``placing'' to refer to a \"crossing\" punctuation. In 1991, Edward T.

A few months later, Helms joined the TNA roster and competed in the Summer of Summer 2016 Summer Show and SmackDown Live.\n\nFollowing TNA's Summer of Summer 2016 Summer Show (TNA Summer Day Show ) in August 2016, Helms signed with Vince McMahon, who asked TNA's executive producer, Todd Wilson to write an article for his book \"Crazy Insane: Truth, Lies and Sinister\" to be published on the company's website, \"Crazy Insane: Truth, Lies and Sinister.\"\n\nDuring 2016 Helms did not return to the TNA roster where he left off in 2017, as he was still working with TNA as an agent.","token_len":382,"entropy":[7.839,3.2014,0.1484,9.9595,2.0817,5.464,0.662,10.7523,0.7051,2.3182,11.9441,5.5694,2.9366,1.0693,5.8628,1.9026,7.7171,0.0852,0.5064,3.7521,2.4341,5.7979,3.1499,4.2926,1.3856,1.5376,1.0785,0.6137,6.9439,5.6755,5.2168,7.4612,1.6195,0.9754,0.2651,4.0991,12.0731,1.5296,0.0015,1.3687,0.7019,0.0009,4.506,1.1331,2.5835,0.3482,4.3935,0.1582,2.4964,0.8531,3.1816,2.7684,0.0007,0.6498,4.238,5.3716,2.179,5.1849,3.2098,6.8438,0.0084,3.8295,1.7901,7.6228,0.1135,5.1572,5.9734,4.033,5.111,0.3362,4.6957,0.0018,2.0644,4.7074,1.2431,1.1497,0.0011,3.164,2.2521,5.8327,4.6262,3.1214,2.9656,0.8114,3.6711,3.5842,0.0024,1.3797,0.4358,0.0002,3.0193,1.4761,2.1138,0.5641,0.2493,1.958,3.75,1.6424,4.5026,0.2347,0.6622,1.3549,5.0314,1.11,4.2966,0.0241,2.4663,1.3941,2.779,0.0006,2.4305,1.7853,0.9232,0.4101,1.6362,0.0002,4.3734,6.3431,0.0023,0.0015,0.002,0.019,4.9885,2.6296,0.0039,0.5026,0.1883,0.0002,3.8392,4.2043,4.6262,3.3367,2.284,2.7613,3.4598,4.0215,2.6003,0.0009,1.0243,3.0455,0.1927,3.2242,4.4988,3.4567,5.2382,0.011,1.9076,5.4599,2.3864,0.0032,0.7458,2.61,2.0717,5.0542,7.0602,2.9397,2.4867,0.024,2.6015,3.1388,6.7707,0.0342,4.8821,5.9636,4.6274,9.6205,5.5313,0.0005,3.7284,0.5637,1.972,4.4068,0.0115,0.1688,3.7543,2.3281,6.2316,0.0045,4.1007,2.153,0.8135,3.3634,1.0282,1.5847,2.6866,4.1661,5.839,2.3057,3.9975,1.7504,5.1499,2.7999,2.7189,6.8479,1.4246,4.7394,3.9652,0.1506,1.7494,1.6351,0.689,2.3531,0.3396,0.4437,0.3753,0.0001,4.94,6.8189,4.4,0.0002,2.942,1.8837,3.6392,6.7511,1.468,3.17,0.0055,3.3315,3.2899,3.728,1.1185,0.1234,2.1553,1.5552,1.884,4.6665,0.3197,2.8506,0.9266,4.5302,0.0333,2.4167,8.5657,4.4564,0.553,1.2515,6.0177,3.1417,4.7703,2.1849,0.9264,0.1552,0.1539,0.8612,0.0004,4.0098,1.6339,2.4535,0.0036,1.7361,1.9213,4.2028,0.9038,1.0304,2.0101,1.5961,4.1549,2.2938,2.1485,4.3877,4.1088,6.3045,0.0039,0.9041,3.8506,1.7282,0.6592,0.0001,4.2389,3.1645,0.0018,0.2796,0.7426,0.7054,1.0086,0.6682,0.6994,0.4086,5.2754,2.9505,0.0249,1.2011,7.5696,4.2212,6.0982,2.0762,2.4925,0.5746,0.0815,0.2585,0.0003,2.8434,1.3114,6.1721,0.0557,3.2588,1.7404,5.1596,6.4925,0.0006,3.7711,4.5273,2.241,1.4367,5.784,6.3347,1.5786,4.6092,2.954,1.9485,1.0454,2.792,4.6757,2.2399,5.0238,2.3328,7.8123,0.2042,1.6988,7.6722,2.1176,1.0604,1.305,6.3284,4.2383,7.1088,3.5383,1.788,0.5575,2.9182,2.3939,2.7046,0.1236,0.2659,3.244,4.8912,2.6999,0.1044,0.0789,0.0023,0.2087,0.7773,0.07,0.003,0.0683,0.0469,0.001,1.1971,0.8093,0.0001,3.122,4.5786,3.2013,0.0003,4.6951,1.1355,3.2771,0.8189,2.0475,1.8439,0.0008,0.8454,5.8605,0.1198,4.2947,6.8074,1.5785,3.9652,1.6928,3.0594,0.7678,1.2757,3.9283,1.2999,1.0505,2.0045,0.0019,3.3945,1.8005,0.888,0.7961]}

They had an armor belt that was 300 mm long and 60 mm wide, and a plate of armor attached to a tank gun. The armor belt included two shell casings connected by a two foot steel link, each arm having a small shield that covered the entire length of the armor belt. This reinforced the armour belt so that it protected against the elements during firefighting exercises, and also helped protect the tank gun and the armor belt from the elements, when they could and could not be destroyed, and it was able to withstand the elements even when the tank gun had been placed directly on it.\n\nThe derfflinger has a.45 caliber caliber pistol on the outside to assist with the front of the gun, there was no plastic casing on the weapon casing either, a.40 caliber pistol was always on hand, and there was no clip on the gun and that was in most areas. The gun was also mounted on a steel shell casing. The gun was designed and mounted by a factory with a factory in South Berlin, it had been delivered to the German Navy and to the United States Navy and was intended to serve in the Navy Seamanship Command. The gun is equipped with a.45 caliber pistol as well as a.30 caliber pistol, it was originally intended to be a secondary weapon, but because of the limited range of the gun and its cost it was designed and mounted on a replica of the gun. During many of the battles in the 1940s the derfflinger had to be mounted on the Gunship ( a modified M4S caliber gun.\n\nThe derfflinger was the last of these tanks, and the gun was mounted on a replica of the gun. It was also made of a plastic shell casing.","token_len":382,"entropy":[11.0487,9.2314,7.1697,10.0025,6.5713,5.8232,10.3261,12.0292,7.5189,8.6789,4.3872,13.2942,1.9702,11.4444,5.4842,3.2139,5.7793,2.1652,4.8727,3.0886,0.9106,4.5112,3.1381,4.7898,2.7608,3.5237,0.53,3.0951,0.7797,3.5223,2.5037,3.8625,3.6384,6.1575,2.2955,1.8612,8.9188,1.4751,0.9873,1.055,4.2885,0.0877,0.6453,1.1454,1.3635,1.8885,5.2855,2.432,4.7392,5.919,0.2946,2.9912,5.9964,4.0351,1.4109,1.3488,2.7611,1.5085,5.3918,2.9375,7.1558,1.7301,0.0051,5.484,0.9781,1.032,5.6534,6.3822,3.7918,4.1654,1.8802,3.2806,8.017,3.4452,0.639,4.7092,4.8823,3.1654,4.0705,0.6606,2.9837,1.1715,0.0575,0.1669,1.4788,2.5356,0.2795,2.8784,6.1042,2.4835,3.5802,3.8065,3.9886,0.2198,1.4626,4.5577,2.7492,1.5794,2.6373,4.0499,4.1504,6.2884,5.9395,2.224,1.1824,2.5669,4.3896,2.3657,0.5661,2.1438,1.8782,3.467,1.6643,3.2682,1.9583,0.8409,1.5059,1.1834,3.1673,4.5746,2.5529,3.361,5.6523,1.7411,0.0232,1.5571,3.427,3.666,2.9257,4.7921,1.4379,4.9315,0.0099,1.4954,1.3291,1.6559,3.8457,1.6656,1.4764,1.5021,1.2264,3.4536,0.6008,6.4387,5.6926,1.5489,4.9349,0.2855,2.2946,0.1327,1.5829,6.3931,0.1039,0.2301,4.7367,1.6556,9.1622,6.6665,0.7466,4.6979,4.4474,4.2308,0.8591,6.1475,6.1291,5.8574,1.7567,1.8663,5.5358,2.6328,0.0766,0.8583,1.2897,7.0496,3.2601,2.3978,7.2572,4.4298,1.3222,0.2017,5.1647,5.5777,6.1205,0.7884,4.9637,3.6244,4.3948,0.2424,2.1238,1.5171,5.604,1.8759,2.6402,1.1151,1.2176,2.9634,0.5562,1.0089,6.7872,1.5229,0.1175,2.3494,4.9366,5.4711,0.8327,4.9438,4.5378,5.8864,1.3928,1.1939,1.9014,0.8556,2.7824,3.8917,0.8316,0.7314,4.5834,4.6861,1.0422,2.1783,1.2898,1.7638,0.8589,3.3628,3.3335,4.3306,2.5954,2.7017,5.1228,3.7902,1.4332,4.4538,3.1956,5.9955,4.8042,1.4772,3.5652,1.7708,3.2422,5.667,0.7457,0.9728,2.5613,1.9121,2.5841,4.2979,0.5329,4.4376,0.1186,1.2173,3.1557,1.4346,3.9605,0.6362,3.9878,2.23,0.8627,3.5919,6.8161,6.914,0.1944,4.9106,1.0288,1.3882,1.2444,3.6152,4.289,0.0393,0.5918,5.5512,2.2003,0.2841,1.5545,4.5185,0.4578,0.6163,0.723,2.0778,2.6936,0.2037,1.6442,1.53,3.0547,1.3152,4.6132,1.8739,0.4249,0.3733,2.498,7.5776,0.9477,1.4889,0.8272,5.0109,0.5858,0.7074,4.205,3.2468,0.5889,0.3281,0.9736,2.465,2.1142,5.2203,2.0539,0.2885,4.4768,2.2638,2.4343,2.7256,0.4081,8.1347,0.9375,0.608,2.2226,0.9233,5.3852,6.9174,2.524,0.3147,1.5395,2.1888,0.7519,5.7501,0.3845,1.6446,2.2311,0.0138,0.017,3.0062,2.0688,0.551,3.6099,0.4908,1.6614,5.9887,3.5658,4.3708,8.0122,6.8379,5.4186,3.0234,5.7716,6.4899,1.1126,4.9169,2.2071,0.0002,1.0547,2.9776,0.0173,0.0103,1.0959,3.2652,3.8491,1.8238,5.5633,4.6915,1.8699,1.9185,2.1601,4.7981,0.9336,5.0409,0.4061,1.2747,4.154,0.2701,0.308,1.0977,0.9487,2.1689,0.7584,2.804,5.0469,1.6111,2.7747,4.0036,1.3509,0.5155,1.9409]}
{"id":3847,"ended":false,"length":329,"text":"When NY 47 was first commissioned in the Rochester area c. 1937, it was routed along previously unnumbered roadways, with its northwest terminus located at the intersection of NY 31 ( Lyell Avenue - Piedmont ) and NY 25. Once owned by the local railroad, the road was later extended by the city of Rochester. Today, it serves as a stop, the ferry terminal and a grocery store. A portion of the road continues westwards, northward up through the village of Lyons to the southern terminus at the Rochester-Laing Strain.\n\nThe road and parking is maintained on and near the bridge, while it is often neglected because of traffic problems.\n\nRoute description\n\nIn the early 19th century, sections of the road were not only used for private use. The roads to Lyons and then its town of Lyons were heavily wooded with a variety of wooded paths offering a variety of terrain. New York 47 was opened on August 1, 1937, connecting the westbound and northbound North Street roads to the Rochester\/Laing Strain. It remained open for public use until September 19, 1939, when it was demolished, or at first only used for commercial purposes and to store food. By January 31, the road was over-grown with trees; however, in the mid-19th century, it was resurfaced with new paths. When the road was originally removed from the original plan, the road was extended out to north of the town of Lyons, where it served as an agricultural base.\n\nThe road also served as an access road to the village of Lyons. The road was eventually demolished and the road resurfaced a few years later.\n\nThere were eight cars on the road by the end of the 1920s.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nRochester\/Laing Strain Road Map to Rochester","token_len":382,"entropy":[11.1567,12.7291,2.3526,4.6248,7.7921,0.8515,3.8369,10.1377,1.6638,10.8385,0.3254,5.2676,0.5673,1.6046,0.9655,10.6611,4.8094,10.2822,3.1023,5.7764,4.5486,0.4259,2.3114,3.3765,4.299,7.7917,2.8313,0.0597,4.3881,1.3045,1.5855,1.837,0.0921,6.1655,5.3978,3.3521,14.2089,6.1388,2.4642,5.7339,5.8068,3.1902,0.0029,4.0707,0.1678,0.6937,4.8224,2.8653,6.3074,8.0633,0.2443,0.9589,5.0572,2.8992,1.1714,1.2802,2.9227,1.13,3.906,4.4065,2.5622,1.6627,3.7387,2.3067,0.2721,2.4799,4.6695,0.7132,2.169,2.9985,0.7921,1.0685,4.5128,4.5,5.2604,6.6535,1.5372,1.6682,2.2466,6.4357,0.1731,0.5407,4.4692,3.764,0.0376,0.4199,1.6232,5.502,3.8316,4.7626,2.5488,4.9234,1.0169,5.154,3.6974,1.134,4.711,0.2324,6.8985,3.1577,1.0111,6.1622,3.0312,0.0006,2.7852,1.6496,4.8171,2.6208,5.4533,6.5754,6.7504,7.289,1.079,1.1296,0.0208,1.8421,2.6249,5.0037,4.964,4.1385,4.0907,3.701,5.8783,2.1966,0.772,4.6134,2.3111,4.3496,4.0138,0.8533,5.3668,6.2726,4.6326,0.343,2.7966,2.6262,0.4186,1.5525,0.0002,4.5839,6.1875,0.9785,0.0002,4.5137,1.8142,2.1658,3.9915,0.0101,0.0938,0.3598,7.7509,0.0578,0.6462,1.2473,0.5674,5.4399,3.7476,2.2158,0.9725,4.6506,1.8319,4.1038,2.1386,3.6805,5.0107,5.1263,1.5434,6.3585,5.4945,7.7764,1.5506,2.5064,0.7049,5.6828,4.6314,0.0373,3.2371,3.0844,2.6986,0.001,3.9781,1.1552,4.0724,7.2344,2.2354,0.9496,0.0025,4.9922,1.2082,5.6643,1.6418,9.3899,0.8724,5.7192,1.9314,3.42,2.0024,0.0682,2.6037,0.8457,7.9126,0.9174,6.3665,1.5273,2.045,3.049,0.0041,8.6502,3.0868,4.1944,2.322,0.6998,4.7682,4.0786,0.9767,0.0016,0.3393,0.0291,0.8738,3.0162,4.4518,0.6839,1.632,5.7402,0.1613,0.4602,3.4326,3.6139,0.0293,2.3555,0.9065,0.5324,1.076,0.1314,3.8395,3.3547,5.5929,3.1808,8.3505,5.1047,2.5184,0.6992,3.0296,1.0699,3.965,5.4712,4.9733,3.6951,1.4794,4.662,4.2375,4.1743,0.0227,4.0109,0.8624,0.5831,4.9486,2.4509,3.5922,0.9031,2.4959,5.9458,3.9565,0.0756,2.917,1.7816,3.182,0.294,0.8423,3.1704,0.0313,0.5687,1.5965,0.3481,5.815,0.0518,3.2916,2.4634,4.8246,1.7776,5.6572,1.0651,1.1896,0.3545,4.7046,5.8651,1.4915,0.7093,4.3284,5.004,0.9697,1.4121,2.434,0.8822,4.6513,5.4948,1.2132,6.1978,2.4047,0.8157,2.2428,1.3398,0.2987,1.5765,3.2303,0.5178,3.8904,0.195,2.6985,4.8644,5.2987,1.2748,1.3885,0.0002,1.462,1.3492,4.2518,0.8968,0.2146,2.1922,5.4068,1.2607,1.4825,0.8112,4.0414,0.1778,0.7349,1.4159,1.6195,1.1885,1.0308,5.0035,4.3747,1.7858,1.6908,1.5308,3.2983,0.0129,5.5083,0.5908,0.3543,0.0828,1.1979,1.4831,0.0002,4.9726,1.7413,5.7181,6.2458,1.3526,0.2808,0.4285,4.5633,1.6545,1.4689,0.0025,1.3507,2.9904,0.1182,0.8844,2.138,0.0002,6.8305,0.5064,0.0004,7.0998,0.5354,0.7007,0.0003,3.758,0.2991,0.0154,3.673,0.1931,0.0009,0.1064,0.0113,4.2124,2.917,6.2135,3.0352]}

{"id":3488,"ended":false,"length":348,"text":"Of Anglo @ - @ Irish descent, William Butler Yeats was born at Sandymount in County Dublin, Ireland. His father, John Butler Yeats ( 1839 \u2013 1922 ), was a liscense farmer who had planted many of the largest number of wheat crops around Ireland, before the invention of the mill, and he made two attempts to cut the crop out of the ground in 1842. However, when William Butler Yeats cut the crop, he lost the balance and lost the strength to produce the wheat, and in 1848, the crop was cut. William Butler Yeats also suffered a severe and fatal health condition, which ultimately led him to fall pregnant in 1854. William Butler Yeats was a man who held great views on human rights, and was highly regarded by Irish people as a kind of great patriot. In 1854, he married Eleanor Raine (n\u00e9e Rose): A young Irishman from London, whose mother died shortly after his marriage to William Butler Yeats, the mother had moved in with her husband and daughter, which would have been followed closely by William Butler Yeats and Eleanor Raine. They had a son Thomas Yeats, a former first lady of the British Empire and founder of the Irish People (1870\u20131940).

{"id":393,"ended":true,"length":338,"text":"In addition to the smaller @ - @ scale expeditions described earlier, Mathews embarked on two much larger expeditions to the African mainland during his tenure as first minister, the first at Mwele, and the second in the city itself.\nIn addition to the three expeditions, Mathews undertook two expeditions, the first at Bwani, in Mwa, and the second at Mwanza, at a time of considerable political turbulence in the African continent.\nIn Mwele, Mathews led the second expedition, bringing together the African and British forces to assist the African government in their fight against the warring sides of the continent. In Mwani, Mathews also participated in the support by the French and British national forces of the colonial government of Morocco.\nIn Mwanza, Mathews joined the British delegation of the King at the Battle of Mwala, which lasted nine months. In addition to the numerous events that also shaped the historic relationship between King John and the British, Mathews also served as both a British and Moroccan ambassador in Cairo.\nDuring the following years, Mathews was a close friend of Zuma and the British monarch. For his time in office, and especially for the negotiations that led to the release of Zuma, Mathews and Zuma were both instrumental in the African government's reform in 2011.\nMathews was also an ardent critic of Zuma and supported his government's leadership at the presidency, which was marked out by a lack of cooperation between the country's governors and Zuma's governing party, which was also dominated by powerful supporters of the dictator.\nDuring the second and third-hand negotiations between the British and the Moroccan government in 2012, Mathews met with Zuma during the visit to Morocco, and in the end, this was followed by meetings with Zuma in the presence of the Moroccan foreign minister.","token_len":383,"entropy":[7.6823,0.9728,1.6129,7.8351,12.0691,7.2107,6.7318,8.468,15.9221,0.2806,7.7213,3.3626,0.2285,10.5943,2.9162,8.4788,0.0821,2.9913,6.122,0.5679,2.0618,0.0003,1.9813,1.1249,7.3975,6.519,4.361,3.5802,2.6647,1.0618,5.5762,4.7976,3.0181,2.9655,1.0586,6.2709,5.4574,7.5856,4.7044,2.829,1.1105,0.5116,0.6013,2.5093,1.9418,5.8966,7.2856,0.4373,1.435,8.5552,2.799,0.2297,1.2244,5.1484,0.7146,0.0028,1.6016,0.4108,0.0013,3.465,2.3746,3.3405,0.0002,4.3187,1.4642,0.483,1.9057,4.4895,5.4454,6.2405,1.4089,2.928,4.441,6.2633,3.0524,1.0008,0.3013,0.2618,0.3377,2.9009,4.5402,2.1287,1.1005,4.4243,4.6496,2.4155,3.8039,4.6364,3.5463,3.8658,1.2507,0.9085,4.1514,1.9037,0.3527,1.4578,2.251,3.6353,0.7624,0.0108,0.3513,0.6923,0.0035,3.9165,1.3208,5.0487,0.513,1.1346,6.1182,2.7189,2.0559,4.3325,3.2324,3.3611,1.8653,1.9038,3.2193,1.4482,3.7841,2.2284,0.2931,3.9386,2.7536,0.1174,0.6146,6.1185,2.6063,3.9973,1.6438,0.5169,3.7942,0.297,1.8046,0.5093,2.4474,1.327,0.2234,0.6666,0.0037,3.4306,3.4248,0.0655,0.6747,6.6013,5.6469,0.8494,4.0888,1.4957,1.245,7.874,1.9988,0.8416,0.6421,5.1201,1.4435,1.5013,6.0322,1.6633,0.7995,1.1493,1.0337,0.3279,0.0006,0.0961,0.4283,0.0063,4.1289,0.8293,2.2097,4.6597,2.2956,1.452,5.3619,4.9178,1.5308,3.8158,0.0245,2.2087,1.5478,6.2895,1.025,2.1485,4.1744,5.8414,1.1873,0.8251,1.5086,2.5002,0.4964,1.2325,5.9864,5.1134,1.6264,6.9697,6.0112,0.645,7.3172,3.8085,0.094,4.8371,5.0289,0.5207,1.4747,2.1654,0.9915,0.8991,0.0067,0.6672,2.7058,0.2643,6.214,1.4209,4.4367,2.3755,4.1368,1.2762,2.7485,4.1258,1.1963,0.4644,3.1737,1.3409,4.4543,0.7594,0.1712,0.535,0.0049,2.1107,2.06,4.5978,1.2798,0.4323,6.8839,3.3237,1.216,2.0058,3.6472,3.8928,1.181,4.9239,2.2943,3.4416,0.8851,1.9527,0.1867,5.5162,2.544,1.7239,1.5446,7.5284,1.7783,2.3442,0.1668,0.6608,4.5862,0.0462,2.1429,0.0109,1.3608,0.6807,0.0034,4.7526,1.9264,0.1524,1.6762,3.3331,3.339,0.1291,1.4747,5.7689,3.0229,0.0912,4.6215,4.0549,5.8704,0.534,0.5594,2.2586,0.0105,1.4651,1.3576,2.6415,3.5369,2.8776,0.014,2.6371,0.0139,1.9164,5.7103,0.8229,3.4142,0.4653,6.6748,4.2279,0.3982,6.4783,2.2566,2.5239,1.8359,4.3175,5.1341,0.3373,1.6487,4.4145,0.0025,5.3709,1.397,0.6482,5.0092,0.1159,5.3987,0.6408,3.678,0.008,0.6024,5.7999,1.0266,1.936,2.6211,1.765,3.2635,2.5664,0.0218,6.4688,4.5425,0.1517,1.0747,5.3905,0.4491,0.6023,3.1931,1.0806,4.3764,2.309,0.1272,7.9139,6.6227,4.1607,1.3488,1.0609,3.024,0.2357,1.5305,3.6332,1.2956,1.4774,4.1022,0.1364,0.8896,0.0035,4.1302,0.5186,0.8812,0.0082,4.281,1.2838,3.8797,1.6134,3.1856,1.8171,1.3617,3.2932,1.6324,2.4013,1.5332,6.2627,2.2492,3.7265,0.1235,5.0202,0.6892,1.5558,0.0294,2.5292,2.0562,4.7238,0.001,1.4113,3.3337,3.2073,0.0619,1.3364]}

The increasing rise in crime in the 1990s and early 2001s also prompted a movement in New York City to promote criminal justice reform. The city\u2019s criminal justice reform efforts were initiated in collaboration with other local communities and led to increased police involvement in drug drug raids, court hearings, and arrests as well as more frequent raids on large, high-risk individuals.\n\nIn New York City, criminal justice reform has been a significant and influential initiative in the city of more than 5 million. But, despite its many potential benefits, particularly given the fact that criminal justice reforms at home are often difficult or even impossible (such as the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey in 2016 by the Saudi prince), the police force in New York City is also at a high risk of collapse due to the many potential pitfalls it faces.","token_len":383,"entropy":[3.0004,1.0271,7.894,5.0839,0.2991,10.2226,3.4645,8.6106,0.2713,0.0043,12.6986,13.2542,7.3247,7.6051,5.8691,8.2125,0.9527,2.6082,1.995,1.6184,8.18,1.8136,2.8859,0.4721,0.6627,5.8587,1.3001,7.5059,0.5853,5.5434,1.3716,7.4782,0.0766,1.1685,2.4705,0.1167,0.0004,0.1828,6.9247,2.6982,1.5354,4.08,0.0505,2.6405,1.8788,6.097,3.9627,0.0012,2.1135,3.9468,3.1886,2.4777,4.4757,4.3749,1.265,0.0489,4.5913,1.6231,1.1347,0.133,4.1186,13.1388,5.9047,3.1224,4.275,0.1978,0.391,7.3213,5.9524,3.5142,2.3077,0.2223,4.9217,1.7164,2.5472,4.3601,3.338,0.5173,2.364,3.9299,0.0132,1.2531,6.0989,1.5216,3.0029,0.9992,4.4174,1.1709,0.9895,1.9397,3.9323,1.1399,2.6089,5.2539,1.5635,4.5186,1.3485,1.1241,0.141,1.4351,1.0305,0.2484,2.0114,0.0004,4.5159,3.9326,1.2231,1.0788,0.4634,0.0039,4.9846,0.3317,1.51,0.6227,0.0014,2.5351,0.2597,0.1564,0.0083,0.0006,0.0021,0.0877,0.0201,7.7373,0.0178,0.0042,0.0157,8.006,0.0011,5.3123,0.0038,4.2099,0.0067,0.0427,0.2403,0.0643,0.0024,0.0032,0.0013,0.0982,1.541,0.0084,0.3996,0.0009,0.0003,0.0013,0.0017,0.0008,0.001,0.0012,0.0014,0.0355,0.0127,0.0008,0.0045,0.0393,0.0057,0.0047,0.0008,0.0011,0.0005,0.0018,0.0033,0.0023,0.002,0.0025,0.0062,0.0145,0.0063,0.0019,0.0015,0.0103,0.0074,0.0032,0.0312,1.2691,0.0001,5.2947,2.7016,6.1501,5.0541,0.0747,3.6918,1.3393,0.3729,1.2815,0.0022,1.4619,0.9113,6.443,2.587,0.0846,5.6535,4.6231,2.3908,0.7409,3.3564,0.038,6.7985,2.3179,3.3054,2.1182,2.2422,5.3212,0.0609,4.2046,3.3291,3.9014,5.6618,3.5688,6.3969,4.1595,5.7851,1.431,2.4057,5.5743,6.4153,0.7219,3.0099,2.1205,0.45,2.4624,0.0021,0.4721,0.2542,0.1029,0.0057,2.7262,4.0654,1.5502,5.0136,2.6392,4.8319,0.4125,0.4101,0.8713,6.5715,4.3609,0.1187,0.2913,0.7181,2.3202,3.3327,11.7997,3.1962,0.2473,3.6923,0.0724,1.6139,2.3773,1.9628,4.7985,1.0123,5.095,0.0068,3.9779,3.6784,2.902,1.6643,3.313,0.2849,3.3782,2.4543,3.5984,0.9357,4.2692,7.3199,4.2648,1.7305,5.5564,2.9829,0.0771,0.2286,3.1755,5.5233,0.2702,0.056,3.626,4.6755,4.503,1.5812,5.3088,3.4504,3.6877,0.1188,2.4273,1.8919,0.5367,1.4718,0.0002,2.1542,3.8398,0.0164,0.1551,0.2347,3.9314,0.3067,0.1059,3.4196,1.5246,1.8833,3.7659,3.5933,5.1774,4.6913,1.6352,1.2862,2.2,2.8186,4.0397,0.0013,4.7048,0.7971,2.2647,5.3163,2.4052,2.7934,2.0128,4.5301,7.0385,1.2807,0.2303,6.6794,5.3135,0.4601,3.8209,0.0146,3.3012,0.1256,3.6982,6.5047,3.4703,1.8063,1.4095,4.7682,3.439,2.5068,0.1147,5.0147,3.6397,0.0535,2.0565,5.9636,0.3405,11.0629,5.1625,3.4122,0.0023,0.0017,1.5303,10.1061,1.5404,6.8786,6.0651,2.7308,5.8647,4.8984,1.6264,1.5194,4.8,4.6294,1.5699,0.6244,0.0022,0.413,1.708,3.8509,4.8255,1.4672,2.6814,0.5136,0.2568,6.2274,3.0748,0.0567,1.7018,5.6187,5.497,4.1922,3.2828,0.5983,0.62]}
{"id":1559,"ended":true,"length":317,"text":"On July 31, 2015, Hamels was traded to the Texas Rangers along with Jake Diekman in exchange for Matt Harrison, Nick Williams, Jorge Alfaro, Jake Thompson, Alec Asher, Brandon Lowe, and Kyle Gibson. The designated hitter will be a free agent by the end of the summer of 2016, and Texas is a complete rebuild.\n\nHamels, 21, is an All-SEC second year starter (14-8 with 12 runs scored) and has not lost a game during his senior year. In addition, Hamels holds the career.249 career run average and has held opponents to a.928 earned run average in his four-year career. Based on his career averages of 9-0 with 1 home run, 4 RBI, 6 runs and.950 OPS, as well as his overall batting average of.300\/.333\/.442 over 50 at bats during his two-year tenure, the Rangers are hoping that his numbers will be a bit more consistent in the major leagues.\n\nHamels has had an average of.298\/.374\/.511 in his career, but his career averages have been above.250\/.343\/.413, or 8.3 points per game. As a player, Hamels is a strong, dynamic, defensive-minded third baseman; however, his ability to hit, run, and steal bases is not something that his ability to get an average out of games can hold. Due to this lack of ability to get an out on a ground ball or an extra base hit, it is almost impossible for Hamels to maintain an average of 6.2 hits and 3.7 runs per game. When combined, Hamels\u2019s average is 14.5 points per game and he ranks fifth in the National League in HR (21.0). Hamels\u2019 career average currently stands at 14.8 points per game.","token_len":383,"entropy":[7.612,3.7979,0.1895,2.7087,0.202,9.0157,5.1838,2.0536,4.9036,0.38,0.5273,5.5136,0.051,5.9966,0.0115,6.0178,5.1702,0.3786,0.0661,3.9967,0.204,0.0025,4.4092,4.4488,1.7658,5.3678,3.5624,0.2899,6.9449,2.7284,0.0112,0.3921,4.9044,6.6333,0.4637,8.4114,6.345,2.298,0.7261,4.671,7.4629,0.3138,1.6729,4.9381,4.7988,0.1988,2.4628,7.7513,0.0768,3.9382,1.713,3.4341,1.4456,0.0069,5.3096,0.6181,0.5787,0.0003,0.2905,4.4946,2.7672,0.7859,2.3498,1.3648,9.0684,2.88,4.017,7.6042,2.4886,1.9859,0.8414,0.0003,2.2114,0.001,2.5449,3.9993,0.1039,2.1561,3.2712,2.643,0.0123,8.5673,2.5055,7.7621,2.8985,4.5021,4.9244,0.8658,3.8776,2.7315,4.7736,5.4998,0.9423,1.5835,0.8406,3.0261,4.0931,4.5836,0.3667,0.5839,4.9267,0.5121,4.4949,1.4494,1.1873,3.3313,3.3612,1.2667,0.8417,0.0017,5.243,1.854,4.2296,8.7259,9.4309,2.6434,6.5793,1.5849,1.6102,1.8349,5.1295,2.2983,0.0871,0.8312,8.577,4.3243,3.9142,5.775,0.0243,0.0157,1.7642,2.1893,3.5729,3.5355,0.1314,0.3042,0.3685,7.1718,0.0553,1.0851,2.3921,4.0358,3.3738,4.0877,1.8985,4.2948,1.964,3.3682,4.2756,0.0166,0.9034,2.6165,2.6834,0.3288,3.8889,1.0953,4.9096,9.9247,8.2715,0.5139,0.7158,7.0481,0.2497,0.0023,1.0594,6.3104,3.4226,0.042,0.915,4.0265,5.4477,4.2947,5.2462,0.0019,5.2031,3.5239,6.0646,4.2828,0.361,3.8695,0.262,3.7345,1.8416,0.1135,2.6251,1.205,3.1491,3.0439,1.8996,5.1059,1.7815,3.3798,4.4431,0.9054,2.7667,2.2114,3.6535,1.1982,1.0017,2.1299,1.6351,6.1943,0.0375,0.8314,0.5707,0.0001,1.4887,0.0019,2.0796,3.8132,2.8618,3.6849,0.6519,1.7917,6.3421,2.9228,4.7132,0.0067,5.2002,1.7742,1.6502,1.7083,1.2663,2.0982,2.0415,2.2997,2.9542,1.7043,1.4802,5.0067,3.5442,4.0241,0.2781,4.1745,0.0033,5.5351,2.6471,4.9101,4.7854,0.4688,3.0347,3.3896,1.1118,0.7182,0.7209,3.9939,1.1404,4.7524,0.5466,0.2179,0.0029,1.9074,1.9971,4.586,3.3651,5.4609,2.4925,5.3047,3.205,0.1934,4.8159,0.0499,5.7783,2.8217,0.0226,1.3608,3.4049,0.0522,1.9716,4.8011,3.0027,0.7298,0.565,2.0709,3.3489,1.2397,2.8363,2.7691,0.9976,4.9316,5.1207,0.3301,4.5891,6.0133,2.3045,3.7375,0.0123,9.3962,3.107,6.2834,1.2115,5.7483,0.0047,2.932,2.7995,0.0308,2.9758,1.7717,1.792,0.5204,5.9953,2.8041,2.6781,5.9687,0.1416,3.1545,3.9765,4.1627,0.1726,1.3608,0.2824,3.7616,0.7226,5.371,0.7398,0.3885,0.3947,0.0026,0.0256,4.1761,2.6545,0.5689,3.0568,6.6053,0.1631,2.7667,4.6996,2.2372,3.6239,0.5224,2.9931,0.8732,0.8651,0.1935,1.0567,5.3098,4.5384,3.0686,0.6171,0.0021,17.1768,7.734,1.1445,3.0905,1.6724,6.321,0.0765,2.3815,2.2751,0.5675,0.1216,2.0824,2.4134,3.0289,3.3835,0.6893,0.2302,2.7122,0.0092,0.3812,5.1806,2.6001,4.0379,1.699,2.395,1.1629,2.0479,0.0014,3.7505,0.0253,11.4249,1.9232,6.595,0.9191,0.0226,3.564,0.0169,2.5855,0.5884,0.6266,0.0253,0.9393]}

Its first mission was established in 1871 as a single outpatient clinic set up for the health and wellness of the poor and needy of Southern Miss. The first hospital operating in Klamath Valley was also established in the town by the Sisters of Providence, which was renamed the Ashford and Ashford General Hospital as early hospitals. This hospital was then operated by the Sisters of Providence and its current name was St. Patrick Hospital.\nTwo hospitals remained in Klamath County, but the Ashford General Hospital is the only one with a physical or psychiatric presence. The Ashford General Hospital was originally known as the Ashford General Hospital, but was renamed the Ashford General Hospital for the Health and Welfare of the St. Patrick and Ashford Memorial Hospitals and Communities Hospital, Klamath Healthcare Area.\nSt. Patrick Hospital is presently the only outpatient clinic in Klamath County. The Ashford General Hospital is home to six emergency departments where patients can receive care at any time without needing specialized care. In both cases, the majority of medical treatment is available for use by patients for only a few weeks, typically beginning with a pre-condition on the appointment that could change during the procedure.\nAll services provided by the Ashford General Hospital are delivered by a team of staff and staff provided by the Ashford General Hospital.

She and three other female female and five of them later on joined one of the smaller fleets of female marine officers too operating on the Scottish coastline from Ford Island.","token_len":384,"entropy":[7.4859,2.836,5.7739,0.3882,9.9849,6.3309,1.9199,11.4068,0.0055,1.1558,1.6102,8.6121,11.5964,2.2383,6.7886,0.1117,10.5502,6.0417,1.3024,4.6117,0.8094,7.3499,0.0005,3.4942,9.1131,3.0941,7.0201,12.9623,7.2743,7.0638,4.5457,12.3594,2.3518,9.5293,0.3471,3.849,3.5944,7.3453,4.7701,1.0404,1.9078,2.4767,0.7129,2.4625,3.9508,5.7339,3.3523,4.4055,6.6832,2.6913,2.0704,0.7202,3.921,3.6441,0.0034,0.3806,4.5887,4.0903,5.5849,8.7227,2.6098,2.8871,0.7711,4.9112,4.9811,4.0708,2.3921,4.4547,5.4738,4.9322,1.6094,1.3366,4.5707,0.5609,4.1314,4.712,3.1261,7.4467,4.0379,4.9651,6.5585,1.5189,1.0323,2.6594,0.3354,0.5311,1.8465,4.8616,2.1855,0.3001,6.4433,4.5353,1.4389,4.091,3.3201,1.725,7.0528,0.9654,2.6815,6.2426,0.8396,0.636,5.5601,3.8507,0.5043,0.8562,2.7113,1.5517,0.1159,2.3522,6.0121,4.9423,4.2602,0.7337,0.8255,2.0915,1.8068,1.6014,1.499,4.3296,4.4065,0.6337,2.9383,5.6243,6.2694,4.692,6.3137,3.9828,5.3763,4.2172,3.1153,5.4807,0.2159,0.3376,4.228,7.4498,1.0563,7.1163,1.1229,0.2504,7.413,5.8713,2.2905,0.8018,2.7755,3.7729,4.6167,5.9476,0.1434,0.7924,1.9506,0.1089,3.8685,0.8367,4.3112,4.0218,0.1218,1.0172,0.6501,0.7896,8.0681,4.3057,5.1647,1.6055,5.3555,3.4557,1.4178,0.0193,0.1389,1.0199,5.6966,5.6918,4.4653,1.1542,4.1706,2.412,2.374,2.1771,4.5636,1.6506,5.9937,0.874,1.7335,0.0003,2.8625,0.6568,2.246,3.5044,5.8978,2.9399,1.302,0.8348,5.6325,1.8906,5.4977,1.5084,2.7965,4.7971,4.3484,5.5291,3.6395,2.8048,1.9251,2.7284,0.0003,8.6851,0.8626,0.0002,10.348,0.0172,0.0014,4.5113,0.0711,0.0158,1.6811,1.4345,2.8704,1.3948,0.3641,0.2791,0.5464,0.6002,0.0076,0.0051,0.0027,0.0046,0.0023,0.0155,0.0011,0.003,0.0017,0.0659,1.1916,0.0002,6.2347,2.9374,0.0002,2.1821,0.0083,0.0015,0.7595,0.0039,0.0036,0.4231,0.501,0.1515,0.0107,0.0215,0.0749,0.1973,0.3148,0.0076,0.0126,0.0028,0.003,0.0013,0.0253,0.0021,0.0028,0.0027,0.0329,0.233,0.0001,5.1778,2.4004,0.1874,0.0417,0.1245,0.1297,0.0009,0.0458,0.0432,0.0002,0.1434,0.0054,0.2181,0.0074,0.0284,0.1719,0.0007,0.0092,0.0022,0.0022,0.0198,0.0015,7.1193,0.0047,0.0006,0.001,0.0097,0.0045,0.0,0.0005,0.0272,0.0007,0.0011,0.0079,0.0032,0.0037,0.0099,0.0016,0.0145,0.0162,0.0107,0.0047,0.071,0.0034,0.0198,0.0029,0.0021,0.0085,0.0208,0.0051,0.0004,0.0025,0.0009,0.0037,0.0098,0.0019,0.0013,0.0024,0.0057,0.0013,0.0212,0.001,0.0015,0.0016,0.0052,0.0012,0.0061,0.0006,0.1139,0.0048,0.0013,0.0018,0.0048,0.0092,0.0034,0.0009,0.0192,0.0053,0.008,0.0027,0.0011,0.0011,0.0036,0.0042,0.0031,0.0026,0.0029,0.0014,0.02,0.0367,0.0578,0.1697,0.0116,0.0377,0.004,0.0064,0.0004,0.0004,0.0012,0.001,0.0051,0.0014,0.0007,0.0011,0.0112,0.0095,0.0012,0.0097,0.0059,0.0004,10.3768,10.7812,0.0687,0.0115,0.0176,0.4969,0.0072,0.005,0.0033,0.0396]}
{"id":4221,"ended":true,"length":326,"text":"In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has categorized benzodiazepines into either category D or X meaning potential for harm in the unborn has been demonstrated. Exposure to benzodiazepines during pregnancy is highly elevated, and the fetus is at higher risk of a heartbeat complaint than in the case of benzodiazepines, while maternal exposure has not been demonstrated in humans. As the world is changing through the impact of drug-induced pregnancy, drug-related risks are likely to be exacerbated.\nStudies on benzodiazepines and other benzodiazepines are continuing to develop. At the 2014 New Drug Administration (NDA) meeting, a significant increase in research funding occurred as two drug-related research groups announced funding from the FDA. The NDA was administered as an initial effort in a process to identify potential therapeutic applications to benzodiazepines in the adult population.\nIn a recent editorial, Scott B. Peterson, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Merck, warned that in order for the FDA to provide appropriate guidance in providing guidance to patients, they needed to include all medications available in the U.S. and to include all medications with long-term effectiveness. Peterson has recommended that the FDA use the same guidance to include benzodiazepines in all the prescribers and prescribers' information regarding medication safety. Peterson believes that while current guidelines indicate that benzodiazepines should be considered an appropriate pharmacological treatment for specific situations, the guidance should include all medications available in the U.S. While no known safe or effective pharmacological treatment is being developed for many of the benzodiazepine products listed on the FDA's website, Peterson believes the potential for widespread use in the United States is still developing. The current guidance applies to all medications available in the U.S. and covers any medication or drug used by employees of any of the U.S. drug companies.","token_len":384,"entropy":[2.6222,4.9429,0.0679,0.2762,1.9547,6.889,0.0458,0.0045,0.0007,1.7495,8.7736,6.6592,0.1898,0.0019,0.1345,4.773,6.2287,6.9522,5.0092,0.6548,6.4546,9.9764,9.5424,1.6755,4.9895,3.9318,1.8246,8.8691,9.2992,0.8177,3.3992,0.6993,7.5027,0.1173,0.9653,0.0028,0.0001,0.0962,3.2869,0.0896,1.8756,4.7928,5.4776,2.0418,1.6687,2.3754,3.1349,1.2414,2.0562,3.2725,0.0023,1.0837,4.5699,8.1233,8.052,2.3732,2.8289,0.861,4.8807,0.014,4.6488,0.0108,0.0003,0.3433,3.0838,5.266,4.3268,1.2972,3.4048,1.8572,0.1821,1.6882,2.5354,3.6451,0.2441,4.4479,2.9703,6.5397,3.415,3.8037,6.4466,1.0308,5.1513,0.0647,3.4207,2.7861,0.7531,5.6957,0.8989,5.3573,0.7099,2.9039,4.2543,1.6049,2.665,0.1275,2.2669,4.8213,0.984,1.4435,21.0101,2.899,2.2157,0.0036,0.0004,0.302,2.4459,2.2469,2.0144,0.0349,0.0013,0.213,2.3012,3.9915,1.152,3.8375,1.756,5.5164,0.9705,7.9413,5.1852,4.5152,2.8394,2.0928,0.617,0.0556,0.165,1.5004,0.7849,2.8677,4.9923,3.847,0.2574,3.2177,2.8269,5.0793,3.5377,6.13,4.7178,1.3554,0.5,3.3898,2.0745,4.8131,5.4114,3.75,0.588,2.2552,1.5981,1.6403,3.5072,0.0277,3.6935,7.413,3.7618,2.3796,4.2891,6.8664,3.643,3.6022,5.1045,1.5616,3.4831,2.1072,4.4511,3.4149,4.1526,1.9075,0.0037,0.0005,0.0343,2.9549,1.0698,5.1458,0.9868,0.4369,2.3286,7.4123,3.342,2.155,4.8302,0.9182,7.0319,4.152,0.9771,6.1644,0.5004,0.8195,0.1561,4.3069,2.1594,0.0674,0.4613,6.0293,0.0143,1.6814,5.7776,0.6408,4.5606,3.571,1.5905,1.6102,1.5291,0.1115,4.5096,4.2802,2.9405,2.799,5.1799,3.797,0.9468,3.3102,1.4296,4.3337,3.9231,0.1549,4.0647,5.365,4.859,5.4626,1.7054,0.3793,3.299,0.0004,0.0007,0.1867,2.853,2.9274,2.4019,2.2714,2.7274,3.8739,5.0929,0.1705,0.1521,5.7291,1.1218,2.5694,4.7127,4.5382,0.565,1.1089,0.3933,4.2072,1.677,3.4522,3.4076,2.0605,4.4,2.0532,0.0055,0.0005,0.0255,1.0515,2.8441,4.2641,8.4921,0.4061,0.143,2.5711,2.48,0.0277,0.0266,2.8355,5.0785,5.0968,4.7527,3.6501,0.8504,3.0083,3.0236,0.3547,4.656,5.0414,1.9469,5.7029,0.3395,1.6386,0.0031,0.0002,0.0505,0.9188,1.0083,2.4462,4.1056,3.8619,5.2504,1.145,1.1585,0.5947,4.3379,5.172,0.2945,1.7379,4.3658,2.4937,2.9728,3.2498,1.0763,1.0856,0.3897,0.0825,0.3183,0.0004,0.001,0.2706,5.8956,4.8308,5.25,5.2169,3.0187,0.1478,3.3967,0.4339,0.7226,1.5894,5.0874,0.8871,1.2204,5.235,1.3054,0.865,2.4256,0.0021,0.0004,1.697,5.0626,2.9063,2.211,0.2642,1.8423,0.943,1.6409,0.1298,2.5774,0.8972,2.8534,5.3621,0.6968,6.1904,1.5873,2.1114,0.892,1.9169,0.0021,1.0699,4.1194,6.1253,0.3915,3.3857,4.1595,2.1881,6.0926,0.5494,1.203,1.9454,2.2204,0.4213,0.0516,0.3159,0.0004,0.0011,0.723,1.2084,5.8936,4.3931,2.2386,4.0923,2.0947,3.9424,2.5349,7.5534,1.8176,2.6222,2.8902,0.1696,4.8112,0.0005,0.0015,0.0166,3.9676,1.2257,0.9155]}

Due to the construction site being on land, the tunnel was severely eroded due to the lack of any drainage in areas surrounding both the tunnel and the road due to lack of sufficient drainage. Prior to the construction they had also planned to develop a small part of it into a long-service road. As work to create the road and tunnels began the work was delayed and the tunnel was completely destroyed within just weeks. The tunnel went into action in April 2015, with the tunnel still in their initial stages of development. Construction began again in October 2015.\n\nOnce the tunnel was being developed both the Welsh and Welsh Welsh organisations developed a joint scheme to reduce traffic congestion and promote the use of alternative routes. The plan was to provide approximately 50% free-hand travel between the towns. There is no standard standard for these routes from the Welsh and Welsh Welsh organisations respectively and the route was designed to reduce this on a local scale as the Welsh and Welsh Welsh organisations have many common interests.","token_len":384,"entropy":[8.5766,2.4744,6.4311,2.4357,3.2674,5.0823,0.8887,6.445,13.321,7.6869,5.6104,11.2746,5.5807,3.2562,7.707,7.5526,1.6461,3.9544,4.2427,6.4287,2.0827,8.5216,7.6178,7.514,4.0105,3.011,13.3929,7.1587,5.6752,9.2813,5.4429,7.6647,7.6589,2.9999,5.8009,4.3478,7.7531,9.9771,5.1093,5.4916,8.0714,5.5232,4.8556,2.3706,4.4703,3.7316,3.7605,1.0684,5.5679,5.2814,4.9337,4.856,5.0983,5.0416,1.3413,5.5197,3.7192,1.6757,1.3671,2.0586,5.7344,0.9797,1.0447,3.7725,3.2927,2.8373,2.3632,3.741,4.2285,4.7471,5.1791,6.1819,4.3826,3.267,7.4903,0.9193,1.1291,5.3229,5.0248,4.8891,4.2528,4.9596,2.2873,5.1234,3.8438,1.5733,7.5007,0.4431,6.407,5.7858,0.5663,4.3788,5.2012,5.1412,2.1251,1.7707,7.026,1.4204,0.0365,0.0371,2.4264,3.0681,2.543,5.4446,3.3137,0.6705,1.2401,3.6014,5.6656,2.0102,0.0007,0.0001,0.7485,5.444,3.929,12.0766,7.3751,4.448,6.839,2.2034,2.9577,0.1624,0.0052,0.2253,0.1528,0.0176,0.0011,0.0005,0.7029,0.8424,0.5253,5.8932,1.4836,4.8666,2.4823,0.622,5.1802,0.1508,0.0015,0.6048,3.4283,0.0086,6.0045,4.5662,7.1523,2.0104,0.0303,0.0271,0.1687,2.6112,1.9596,0.0026,1.756,5.9021,3.5403,2.6722,1.0903,2.8039,4.1085,2.5865,5.6277,0.161,0.9847,2.4609,4.2045,5.0856,4.2005,2.6122,1.2649,6.8322,0.7519,4.7375,2.9298,2.9958,0.0982,0.0886,3.6607,0.4784,10.1733,0.0358,1.407,0.3623,0.0121,0.0015,0.0013,6.4487,1.7761,5.8629,0.0036,0.8168,4.5648,5.4058,1.6434,3.5089,3.8302,2.545,1.3266,4.6503,1.3884,7.1286,4.2173,3.8826,0.0027,0.9524,3.3716,0.0021,4.4433,4.2683,3.643,6.2062,4.1483,7.4414,1.0058,2.0219,0.274,0.4683,2.7347,6.5021,0.006,4.6366,0.0031,4.3998,1.6631,1.4263,6.15,0.0408,1.1499,1.9388,7.8728,1.1589,4.1386,3.8948,0.6438,4.9552,0.7405,4.4293,5.3001,0.0386,4.5196,2.3473,0.4814,4.8223,2.373,7.9163,3.7528,2.1597,3.9915,6.2308,5.5757,4.9195,1.2663,3.4006,4.3908,4.35,1.5141,3.3495,3.3408,1.2829,3.0076,2.4894,1.5371,1.9512,0.826,5.1031,3.1401,5.5776,4.3714,4.9299,0.8047,1.9019,1.7396,5.3951,2.9356,4.5541,1.5103,2.5313,2.8009,1.902,2.4668,0.9307,2.3881,4.3429,1.3724,7.3754,5.1224,1.5048,0.6686,2.0192,0.506,4.4867,1.63,5.0647,0.6534,3.0338,0.8334,1.9029,0.9485,0.0002,6.3243,1.0851,1.2794,0.504,6.7579,2.9226,6.722,1.3041,6.9,1.3454,3.6017,7.5058,7.6621,5.3954,0.9039,2.4803,4.688,1.0709,5.885,2.7355,1.6337,2.0327,4.862,2.153,2.0957,0.0282,3.6321,1.7517,1.1742,1.3184,3.9251,0.9899,0.9418,3.3616,7.0579,3.2062,2.8253,6.9429,4.4177,4.8228,3.7528,2.0698,1.6977,3.1998,3.7166,4.3934,2.7271,1.5912,6.8567,5.039,1.8,4.3758,1.2412,6.0787,1.7702,2.1447,1.5491,0.1587,5.1026,1.0589,6.9219,2.621,1.7903,4.143,1.51,2.3843,0.3684,3.505,4.2283,5.539,1.5427,2.7214,3.1681,3.8648,2.4384,3.0823,0.8112,0.0137,3.5264,0.2858,2.8341,5.2711,5.0614,2.7318,1.3526]}

The bacteria also can help to decrease the pressure in the fluid and prevent contamination of the water by bacteria.\nAs water increases in concentration (i.e., the concentration of water in the surrounding fluid), the presence of bacteria on the surface to prevent water infiltration becomes evident. The bacteria on the upper surface provide a barrier against water infiltration by a \"bubbles\", \"spheres\", or \"bubbles\" on the water surface.\nThe number of bacterial species is a function of the water pressure (i.e., the rate of pressure applied). The number of bacteria in a given atmosphere, or water level (i.e., the pressure at which the bacteria and other fluid can move).\nA water surface may be either a dry atmosphere or a wet atmosphere. The dry surface is comprised of air (i.e., the atmosphere is hot or cold) and air (i.e., the air contains solids, such as water). The water surface may also be comprised of particles, such as algae. The air surrounding the water surface contains water.\nSince both air- and water-soluble polyethylene fibers (OESFs) are water soluble and are able to float and flow in the atmosphere, the use of OESFs for swimming in a hydrophobic environment can be useful.","token_len":384,"entropy":[10.8152,3.0048,6.2927,8.2289,2.5978,1.6988,0.0007,1.886,10.2025,7.5397,0.7715,1.2974,4.5559,4.6851,1.8927,6.8512,5.788,5.682,4.1445,5.7518,7.68,5.6412,3.6742,8.9253,0.1544,8.1686,0.2106,7.8334,5.1548,4.8074,1.3431,1.9379,1.1202,6.6672,3.8607,7.8685,0.0317,5.5594,10.3811,3.4365,3.0694,2.1566,4.7622,2.1545,0.0211,4.3353,0.6977,1.7181,5.6783,1.2465,1.8573,7.9067,0.5791,3.1901,3.0085,0.7667,2.9041,1.3906,1.3429,1.617,5.4052,0.1829,0.2737,0.3963,0.2727,1.7229,6.0185,3.0542,2.2567,4.7949,1.9958,2.8735,5.4697,2.594,4.926,4.7742,1.4817,0.0924,0.05,4.8919,1.0048,4.9855,5.7934,0.1052,1.5508,3.585,3.3098,1.3887,2.0181,1.7303,0.7661,4.7713,2.0729,1.9755,1.073,1.0319,6.6991,0.0552,0.1051,1.1966,2.8087,3.838,4.9647,3.9433,3.1585,2.7244,2.7168,0.6926,6.4751,4.0189,6.1449,2.0999,2.4291,2.8263,0.2536,0.0236,0.1148,0.9536,2.7752,3.4577,3.2253,1.464,3.6299,1.5681,5.5846,0.8421,3.1279,2.1846,0.1746,4.1568,2.5615,2.5743,4.9786,0.9433,0.5606,2.4369,3.3913,1.9322,0.9322,0.7872,4.9764,3.795,5.8432,0.3495,2.971,3.7626,3.6655,0.002,0.0017,0.177,2.0901,2.0856,0.2114,2.1248,1.3463,0.3754,5.3084,2.0379,1.5616,1.5116,5.6498,0.0582,0.8955,4.9084,0.51,0.5249,7.6342,2.4789,1.685,2.0746,3.6977,5.5268,0.431,2.2517,2.1441,3.875,0.1663,3.6179,2.1034,5.2244,1.0969,1.6451,0.5606,1.0637,0.9185,3.0777,4.4517,5.5127,4.7142,4.5033,3.5767,4.4016,4.0369,2.6041,1.3085,0.8187,1.14,2.738,0.2708,0.461,4.3102,0.3854,3.036,1.576,0.6579,1.89,2.0906,5.3284,0.1579,3.1698,1.5902,3.2191,3.2975,2.2774,0.0062,0.5612,2.9782,2.8858,2.4165,1.2623,0.001,0.0017,0.039,0.7855,5.7527,1.0655,3.1299,4.2631,3.3667,1.3173,2.2541,0.0317,0.691,2.0975,1.5576,2.3077,5.9909,3.3617,2.9342,3.4969,3.614,2.252,0.4901,0.001,0.0021,0.0209,0.6084,2.3769,2.3565,0.2601,1.2263,0.8734,5.791,1.647,6.863,2.9695,0.5667,5.1336,1.2012,3.4637,3.2643,4.0166,4.2726,1.2421,4.2759,1.607,5.2639,5.4963,0.8384,0.3345,1.2529,1.1653,0.588,2.0179,1.1526,3.9064,1.3617,5.4931,0.0542,4.0411,2.5176,1.4232,0.0015,0.0049,0.039,1.9095,3.8387,2.1641,6.1197,2.7239,1.0479,1.8017,0.6306,3.3412,1.6017,0.2871,0.0029,0.0083,0.0132,0.5138,1.1894,4.6692,6.2752,0.0732,2.2833,2.5132,0.0019,1.9975,1.6296,1.0151,4.3187,2.3399,2.1463,1.1403,0.9034,4.2936,0.0106,4.6348,1.9425,0.5539,0.0035,5.5058,2.781,1.7134,2.6,4.3848,0.3369,1.2894,0.7663,3.3536,2.7472,2.8417,0.9213,5.8791,5.3172,1.7107,6.3334,0.3314,0.4112,0.0297,3.2019,0.2444,6.0074,5.7434,0.0209,5.4735,2.1172,5.2818,4.0216,3.0877,0.1965,0.6647,4.0146,0.7593,2.3894,2.5956,4.0094,0.0019,5.1319,2.9056,3.9625,2.422,1.0474,2.8493,0.337,1.5274,5.6994,0.0175,0.8707,0.0292,0.0616,2.3496,2.0445,2.2716,2.7128,6.1007,2.1711,0.0249,0.7743,2.6295,1.2334,3.3207,1.3354]}

Unlike many of Tennyson's other important poems, `` Ulysses' takes place on the nineteenth-century US territory of Canada, much to the dismay of the country's large English community, who were a minority in the early years of the British empire.\n\nIn \"Ulysses\" (1833), Tennyson recounts the story of a young man named John Tennyson, who, like other Englishmen, migrated into this country after losing his father and brother, to the US.\n\nHis poem is one of Tennyson's best known. In one verse of Ulysses, he describes the birth of his own child in Philadelphia and his grandfather in Boston as \"the worst English he had ever heard of\". The other words of Tennyson come off as the English 'Englishman' Tennyson.\n\nHe also describes the birth and death of John Tennyson and his siblings in Worcester, Massachusetts. In Ulysses, Tennyson talks of his father who was \"the father that brought me to this place\" where \"I know that for our good fortune, all I must ever have is his love for me.\" Tennyson describes his family as \"...fearless and loyal\".\n\nThis poem is inextricably linked to his earlier poetry, an analysis of his early life where Tennyson describes the \"disguised death of his parents and stepfather\" and discusses the \"sadness and depression\" of his own parents' death in 1833.\n\nTennyson is also depicted as a religious figure, who often uses words like \"savage man\" and in Tennyson's early prose, \"God\" was often used.\n\nHe also suggests that American and British society had made many mistakes with Tennyson.","token_len":384,"entropy":[9.6754,9.1444,1.7999,10.1916,3.1495,7.0605,2.6528,2.9773,4.3379,1.0533,2.7473,2.4636,0.7421,1.4564,1.6056,0.2747,2.0963,3.0754,1.3528,4.1041,3.0678,4.6007,4.3735,1.5822,5.0511,0.0796,1.1861,7.6945,3.1993,1.0337,7.8148,0.0001,0.0022,1.7394,7.1335,1.2543,0.1303,12.1374,13.439,1.0194,0.0004,4.3305,10.3419,1.6248,2.4988,1.2268,6.4388,2.8712,0.1335,7.267,4.9217,0.236,5.7521,1.4698,5.9311,2.5165,0.1165,1.3994,0.0385,1.1753,5.1076,0.0541,6.2728,4.2907,3.6973,2.0793,1.8464,2.3317,6.0622,2.5077,0.5484,0.595,4.9294,3.2605,0.1841,0.2576,4.7221,2.6562,1.3558,4.0345,0.0039,2.8032,5.1476,1.1353,0.0063,0.0004,3.2741,2.9717,0.6367,1.7062,0.3953,0.4295,0.0003,4.721,1.1074,2.9118,0.0267,1.2488,1.8572,1.5326,1.1726,3.2459,1.7013,0.0008,0.7074,0.6335,2.2477,4.6339,2.6436,3.672,1.0009,0.6322,6.2536,4.1953,4.6356,1.6074,3.2811,5.0025,0.1946,2.3376,2.2005,2.921,2.0522,3.2143,2.4079,4.1457,0.8014,3.8341,0.0002,4.2122,6.748,1.9258,3.1976,0.0635,4.463,0.0006,0.0016,3.1214,0.801,2.9135,2.339,4.2858,3.967,4.3591,5.4633,0.0008,0.0012,0.3932,2.1254,1.6914,1.4202,6.5846,0.2095,1.0725,4.8134,2.7342,3.0745,7.3677,2.8072,2.9399,6.9395,2.8407,3.5467,4.4796,1.8859,2.148,4.6569,5.813,6.5966,1.1905,0.2705,1.6701,2.7537,1.1925,2.6968,4.1092,4.8947,1.6126,1.1305,0.0015,6.614,7.0186,0.4096,4.4967,4.0925,6.0125,5.1061,2.9761,1.0397,7.877,0.0023,2.3438,0.9385,0.0002,4.1087,2.4014,2.2635,1.1592,4.0054,3.3366,1.1263,0.0425,4.0144,0.693,0.0021,3.3189,1.0833,5.1619,1.9395,7.2709,0.3151,0.2127,1.087,2.6625,3.9051,0.0012,0.001,0.3517,0.5596,0.0007,5.6764,1.8121,1.6474,2.4751,4.5919,1.7612,2.4454,2.1939,4.4936,6.2979,3.2245,1.9957,1.3998,1.3026,2.1554,2.6053,4.628,2.1497,2.3225,5.2194,2.2847,5.4082,5.8253,4.4008,2.8024,1.5186,4.5007,4.2612,4.2213,4.1151,2.0732,1.791,5.681,3.9855,2.2007,0.6723,2.5254,3.1742,0.0011,2.8228,0.8166,3.6365,1.041,6.4607,5.4216,3.0077,0.4913,1.5541,4.3666,3.0222,0.7889,0.0002,4.1111,1.4252,1.2874,4.4619,7.5917,0.0002,0.0117,0.9961,0.3724,2.5597,4.1769,4.0625,0.9973,6.7752,5.6634,0.1958,2.9661,3.7678,0.478,5.0293,1.6928,0.0008,1.5224,1.8234,3.639,6.0456,4.0893,0.7256,5.9597,0.6299,0.656,4.2095,2.2386,5.1034,0.7921,1.774,1.5522,5.4496,1.0441,2.3724,5.0696,2.6055,1.386,1.5669,6.3426,0.9032,0.9057,0.6604,4.2259,3.2768,3.2796,1.6957,2.9554,2.5445,2.4803,0.236,0.745,0.0002,1.8028,0.0006,3.0483,2.2997,5.4763,0.8451,1.0172,5.5059,1.0931,1.4236,3.1789,3.8065,4.5773,4.9817,1.6614,1.1226,3.699,3.0821,5.2052,0.4078,0.5383,7.0502,6.6853,0.0018,0.0946,4.413,5.2414,1.9434,2.0164,4.4453,2.4257,4.4665,2.0747,0.7122,2.286,1.3851,0.0001,3.8203,2.1115,6.7537,0.635,5.8584,4.54,0.93,3.7942,2.7773,5.1883,3.9422,1.3455,3.4285,4.0115,0.0009,2.4585]}

Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins ; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as the bone, the liver and the heart. Moreover, a ribonucleic acid, commonly referred to as SARA, is a small molecule synthesized in situ by chemical manipulation of the cell host immune system (Jensen et al., 1997; Jansen et al., 1998). The ability of SARA to bind and form reactive, non-transporting and non-toxic proteins and to reactivate and bind to other viral proteins and immune system elements, including antibodies, is an important feature of the SARA molecule. The use of ribonucleic acid has demonstrated enhanced stability in vitro as well as as in vivo by the binding of SARA at multiple stages of response to viral antigen. The ability to bind to ribonucleic acid has also proven to be important in vitro as is the ability to reactivate or bind both immune system elements and protein receptor proteins. The SARA molecular architecture of ribonucleic acid with ribonucleic acid, or SARA, ligatures, has further demonstrated that SARA can reactivate the inter-specific binding of B-cell receptors within T cell membranes, allowing for the production of many therapeutic agents. The ability to reactivate T cell membranes and thus enable the use of the SARA ligatures has been shown to protect both human lungs and to promote organ transplantation.\nThe present invention also relates to an improved composition and method for the production of reactive, non-transporting proteins (RNN) in a high-sulphur liquid. In the present invention the reactive, non-transporting and non-toxic proteins are synthesized as a single composition containing a non-transporting portion.","token_len":384,"entropy":[6.8924,10.6643,8.5512,8.386,1.218,5.2663,0.0073,1.7225,10.3163,16.2359,6.1975,6.3546,7.67,9.4735,5.1074,1.4017,7.6622,4.1968,0.4431,1.2561,8.4728,0.2177,4.0084,8.9502,5.1841,0.4564,0.2312,3.7275,2.4179,5.1318,0.0068,0.1437,1.0657,7.6478,4.355,0.2423,5.5097,0.0116,0.2372,5.4117,0.0249,1.9435,4.7162,2.163,4.074,3.3966,1.347,0.7103,1.6404,0.2954,6.6265,0.0215,3.7819,5.863,2.0357,0.2128,0.3748,0.0334,2.7996,5.4307,1.6472,0.0139,0.0346,5.9817,9.7789,0.4115,0.693,1.0977,5.8819,1.4134,6.9653,0.0489,1.7282,6.099,2.1595,5.9121,6.5544,1.6561,2.1074,3.8839,7.5899,6.5618,0.651,2.6723,5.0828,3.2034,0.555,0.0025,0.4308,3.3956,1.3783,4.1736,3.0773,0.2436,0.0003,0.0264,2.0105,0.6678,2.2997,4.8369,0.2997,0.9869,0.0222,0.0962,2.5023,2.4712,5.0609,5.6785,5.5889,2.4665,0.4331,4.0619,3.7538,3.3824,1.9508,0.0765,3.7888,0.1164,2.8252,3.0408,1.8017,5.5963,2.1039,0.0001,3.6558,2.3962,0.93,2.424,6.3614,1.2447,2.0977,5.7686,3.9049,4.7658,2.9858,2.1776,5.6199,0.5747,1.3124,3.2832,0.3591,2.4579,0.2644,1.708,3.59,0.1449,4.3661,1.0441,2.3303,5.2432,0.0074,5.9534,0.0462,0.0263,0.0187,0.1842,2.6559,5.3436,6.9247,3.2282,1.9224,3.0333,3.7951,0.5901,0.0413,4.4494,0.3258,0.0437,3.0507,2.054,5.2758,0.2431,1.4456,0.0421,5.234,4.7765,5.7759,0.2527,7.0249,1.654,2.5371,4.6782,1.6672,2.1175,2.5247,1.4676,0.5276,1.5221,4.4206,0.0316,0.0027,0.0018,0.2324,1.1892,0.7637,5.052,1.1858,0.2161,3.6164,0.8601,5.2631,1.7991,4.695,0.5714,0.8535,0.4588,4.3695,0.0516,0.0003,3.6312,0.54,6.4512,6.8758,2.0399,2.3844,0.8389,4.0654,8.6688,2.6925,1.0495,2.159,3.5781,0.0833,5.1719,4.2976,4.1194,3.2897,0.0181,0.0093,0.0138,0.0804,6.9757,3.7791,0.1302,0.3366,0.1027,0.1512,3.8717,4.4357,1.6437,0.3355,2.8886,5.7376,4.7559,2.548,2.0885,6.7438,3.1248,2.3357,2.0499,0.0174,1.487,4.9164,0.1971,0.0003,3.7677,5.465,2.4381,4.7284,3.2958,1.2131,6.0416,1.7195,1.7747,2.9554,6.0023,5.6732,2.993,4.8261,2.0954,4.8288,1.4951,1.5163,4.2472,0.0408,5.3333,4.5179,2.0821,1.4152,2.0772,2.1365,0.9861,4.6006,0.0108,0.0003,4.5878,0.9025,2.8757,2.1174,4.2173,6.1653,1.2918,4.021,0.0122,3.0539,0.954,0.0402,3.4172,2.216,1.154,1.3286,2.1746,0.2187,5.1578,4.9435,2.9952,8.684,0.4006,4.4491,3.4166,7.0388,1.582,0.029,1.1882,2.2537,10.4189,4.9366,2.0465,2.7388,2.5874,0.214,3.7314,3.409,6.8978,1.713,6.1557,1.2117,1.3399,3.0965,0.1583,6.2279,1.4328,0.1893,0.0105,0.1349,0.4038,4.2229,2.9967,1.504,5.8208,2.0492,1.9687,2.7681,5.1488,1.3362,4.9548,5.1101,0.017,0.0333,7.8624,2.5788,2.6001,1.9353,0.347,0.2169,2.9613,5.0324,0.7538,0.0603,0.0029,0.0087,0.236,2.6736,0.2938,0.0041,0.0241,0.0085,1.8515,1.2608,4.2913,0.0388,3.5106,1.898,3.1722,8.9962,4.5316,1.9253,4.4218,0.2306,1.5367,2.4568,5.6274,1.9894]}

Aang explains he plans to challenge Fire Lord Ozai only after Sozin is convinced that he is the one who can destroy his powers, resulting into the \"Firebending Challenge\", the ultimate showdown against Ozai, resulting in Anang joining Aang's forces\n\nIn \"Aang vs. Korra\" for those of you unfamiliar with the concept, we see the duel between Korra and Aang at last, culminating in the battle over water. It's the largest battle ever, because by that point, Korra really had no choice but to attack Fire Lord Ozai only to be defeated due to the effects of her firebending powers.\n\nSo it was a rather surprising moment. With all those years of training for the waterbending competition, and years of practice at Aang's waterbending class, why didn't Aang just go off and run in the water? He would've had to go against Fire Lord Ozai, which would have been more than enough. But I still can't shake that Korra really wanted to compete against him, so it had to have happened. So that brings us to the real finale.\n\nAs you can see, Avatar: The Last Airbender season 7 episode 3, \"Rising in the Clouds\" is the last episode of their 12-episode six-season long series, which began at the beginning of their 11th season and ended with the series finale of \u201cThe Last Airbender,\u201d which aired on August 18, 2016.\n\nWhat did you think of that premiere?

It is a very popular remedy.\n\nI also love teas, and it also produces a ton of herbal herbal remedies.","token_len":384,"entropy":[8.2063,10.1593,7.3546,11.532,0.9769,12.5945,1.7128,9.0987,3.3749,4.4125,9.4373,5.9126,2.0724,9.7572,3.1795,2.5536,5.4851,7.4005,9.0852,9.2249,11.8632,5.6126,6.0668,7.2067,2.4824,6.1974,6.1934,2.5496,2.4505,0.0293,0.5729,0.9149,5.7235,0.6874,4.739,1.3544,4.1089,4.1642,8.1664,1.0876,2.2069,2.3091,1.8168,4.1189,1.5835,2.5437,0.849,0.9045,4.082,4.4918,4.5478,0.7397,0.5363,0.7883,5.8116,1.3733,0.4878,3.728,0.5153,4.1708,0.697,5.4175,1.2076,5.4887,2.2459,5.3467,4.1862,0.24,0.7276,2.1411,0.0588,2.0467,4.1095,2.5472,3.0077,2.997,4.4332,1.234,1.9336,1.3811,5.5598,0.0021,1.1011,3.5696,3.5036,4.465,6.1565,0.2436,1.6046,4.5518,2.5307,6.762,5.9215,2.4481,5.7918,6.9176,2.5807,3.8603,0.9956,2.926,6.8623,2.8192,1.7256,2.298,1.7899,5.429,5.7721,1.5467,5.8861,7.0165,2.0186,3.4017,3.3305,3.9769,5.5192,1.4994,0.1957,3.6517,1.3818,3.3509,0.3843,1.9667,3.5478,5.0486,5.2427,2.8686,5.9262,3.58,1.1743,1.304,1.6322,3.6624,0.2716,1.2361,0.9904,1.7146,4.1625,0.547,0.9439,1.7499,5.3526,1.5197,1.1881,2.5635,6.679,3.2541,7.6765,6.5535,0.0009,0.6361,3.113,3.1497,2.7117,5.1321,3.1929,7.5479,0.3396,4.9551,2.3512,3.7811,5.2232,3.4625,1.1461,5.0672,4.078,3.4888,4.2395,2.868,7.7112,0.1876,4.6779,4.7616,5.9232,5.8057,4.2866,3.6611,0.0136,5.9454,8.1359,2.0553,1.2712,6.2415,0.103,0.4263,2.0354,2.417,1.7774,3.131,3.5837,0.3282,0.7111,4.8683,3.2285,4.186,2.2057,2.8742,2.7295,0.0273,7.3699,3.2668,7.7457,0.0654,2.3312,2.2683,5.7803,1.4234,0.7665,2.8065,2.5394,2.2621,2.3096,1.933,1.0897,3.8347,4.5498,2.377,4.2586,4.1511,2.3082,3.7962,0.5502,2.0743,2.9573,1.0731,2.4484,2.6826,6.0339,3.8571,1.7255,6.6671,1.9283,5.7061,2.4153,2.2509,1.336,0.0701,9.1154,1.7307,2.6133,3.4767,1.8221,1.526,5.861,3.5936,3.2545,4.8118,3.3009,2.2919,4.3475,2.5308,4.628,0.0055,5.0681,3.8505,2.2914,5.1809,0.0155,2.2088,3.5726,1.2932,0.0373,1.7306,2.2065,3.0772,1.5226,3.7685,3.3796,2.0322,4.6476,0.8069,0.7714,7.5135,0.2876,0.6923,3.9323,1.2973,3.4536,0.5136,0.9747,0.0003,3.5838,2.8802,1.3337,2.5902,4.9357,5.2961,0.9154,0.5836,2.8072,1.093,2.8369,4.0943,2.4479,0.0552,1.1772,1.4821,1.1195,1.9777,3.7127,0.1136,3.0612,6.9843,1.4774,1.867,5.4907,2.4883,2.0032,3.8986,3.0226,3.7316,1.5822,6.2489,3.4407,1.3878,0.5863,0.8786,0.9061,1.1071,1.494,1.6833,1.9174,1.5846,1.5012,3.1958,2.1571,0.4096,0.441,2.3546,0.9659,5.2919,7.0788,0.0502,4.3259,2.845,5.4531,1.9038,0.6842,2.4696,1.4668,5.973,4.4203,2.368,0.1381,1.5736,1.7219,5.5672,0.9848,1.2775,3.2841,4.9502,3.7742,2.7514,0.7547,5.5569,0.8163,2.869,1.3771,1.54,0.9926,1.7233,2.3268,3.7436,1.7868,3.1782,1.3586,0.0003,1.9508,3.0222,2.9064,6.6488,0.2981,1.6519,2.0111,3.7766,4.9268,6.2181,1.2812,4.8151,0.1421,4.2099,5.3856,3.3396,1.1878]}

Benzodiazepine abuse is mostly limited to individuals who abuse other drugs, i.e., poly @ - @ drug abusers. On the international level, Benzodiazepine deaths are reported daily, with a much lower proportion in the United States than anywhere else, and the drug is also prescribed for insomnia (7 out of 9 deaths in Europe since 2006). Benzodiazepine abuse continues to increase, with the number of deaths occurring on the American and European levels, and in Canada and the United Kingdom, with Benzodiazepine-related fatalities reported on and off the continent.\nOn one occasion, a high-risk drug use disorder was reported in Australia (one death per 100,000 patients in the United States and one death in Canada per 100,000 inhabitants). In the United States alone, Benzodiazepine-related deaths were linked with drug abuse. In Australia, the proportion of deaths occurring in the United States was 8.8 (2.2 in 2004), and in Canada, there were reports of more than 100 deaths per 100,000 people annually. On February 5, 2006, Australia reported a record 8.3 deaths per 100,000 people annually in Australia. At the same time, in February 2008, India reported a record 9.5 deaths per 100,000 people annually as well as more than 300 deaths per 100,000 people every year. Benzodiazepine-related deaths in India were more frequent than in both countries. In 2007, India reported a total of 36,731 deaths ofBenzodiazepine abuse.\nIt was recommended at the time that Benzodiazepine-related deaths should be limited to those individuals who abuse other drugs.

{"id":3046,"ended":true,"length":329,"text":"The human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is the virus that \u2013 when the infection is not treated \u2013 can cause AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ). Most virologists believe that HIV originated in humans and not on the human body itself. Although HIV has a much stronger capacity to infect, the exact mechanism is still unknown. However, two main causes of HIV-related infections are:\n\n\u2013 HIV increases the levels of immunogenicity of a cell;\n\n\u2013 HIV causes a reduction in the immune response to antiretroviral drugs (ART), causing a decline in the ability to make vaccines\u2013 and\n\n\u2013 HIV makes it more difficult for HIV to enter cells.\n\nEthals said that the human immunodeficiency virus had the opposite effect because the body is made stronger by the antineoplastic drugs than by the biological weapons that kill HIV-infected cells. Most antiviral drugs are made by the virus itself instead of by the cell itself. HIV is more capable and durable than HIV in that it is a naturally occurring virus, unlike AIDS.\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV ) has a much stronger capacity or capacity for killing HIV-infected cells. HIV has the same immunity as HIV, but its ability to infect cells has much lower capacity to kill HIV. The AIDS virus is more capable in infecting human cells than HIV, because it is naturally occurring virus.\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV ) develops as a result of a \u201cherbiotic\u201d (a chemical of the human host that helps it keep infection alive) on the human body. When the virus infects the cells by its antibodies, the body destroys the virus and begins to die of AIDS. In the case of AIDS, cells are stripped of their antibodies and the body simply produces a new version of the virus.","token_len":384,"entropy":[7.591,7.1438,0.0118,0.0005,0.0003,0.0025,0.3274,10.0367,0.2234,1.3786,2.1398,3.0953,0.6064,12.3016,3.1575,4.1471,4.1696,0.697,3.8369,3.0854,0.6932,2.6279,1.1574,1.8107,3.3564,8.2399,0.0565,0.0012,0.0006,0.0005,0.5064,0.8467,4.9036,7.7684,0.0285,0.1467,2.6795,0.2368,1.203,8.4662,0.8839,2.3511,1.5377,4.7473,4.3282,2.1457,3.2903,0.4466,4.9112,0.4912,4.3712,1.553,2.5627,2.4353,4.946,4.567,5.9163,0.4756,2.2933,4.8699,2.5201,6.0212,1.5293,1.8336,1.5342,0.9293,0.2296,3.4495,0.0294,6.1923,4.6216,4.8206,0.3599,0.906,3.6978,1.4354,2.6652,0.755,2.9905,2.4766,0.0012,4.5998,2.681,5.1445,0.7238,4.7497,0.0122,5.4124,5.3663,0.3734,4.3192,3.1231,2.3183,4.68,0.5057,0.0005,0.0366,0.2462,2.948,2.1202,4.3102,0.1983,0.8134,2.2975,1.1559,0.7095,4.9629,0.2032,0.0003,0.0,0.0197,1.306,1.6733,0.9012,2.4609,3.9975,2.2287,3.6299,0.0345,0.8942,3.1835,1.5775,4.8981,5.8857,8.3822,3.3579,1.1202,0.0004,0.0399,0.1215,4.4673,2.7085,1.5795,0.1678,0.5022,2.1205,1.2665,2.1368,2.8044,1.1396,0.7488,0.0004,10.2557,14.2697,8.7104,0.5954,1.7365,3.4954,0.8662,0.0019,0.0002,0.0007,0.0069,6.776,2.7726,6.4678,0.4736,4.8543,2.5938,3.8129,2.8158,4.8362,7.3325,0.4654,1.3988,4.8712,7.489,0.4699,0.0354,4.3305,5.9446,0.9011,0.7538,5.7953,5.3084,2.3527,3.9883,1.8361,3.4341,0.1345,0.0054,0.3123,0.1582,6.2102,4.7204,0.1995,0.2775,1.9161,2.5008,1.6243,2.0008,4.099,2.0842,5.2746,0.073,0.8737,0.9434,3.3983,1.3336,0.5986,5.6869,2.135,3.7242,4.7856,5.882,5.0911,0.8496,2.5146,3.3337,2.6166,0.46,1.5132,3.7105,5.2644,0.2301,0.7323,1.6098,3.5988,3.3964,1.3232,0.5817,0.0003,2.2779,1.9206,0.2832,0.0016,0.0007,0.0011,0.005,1.0277,1.565,0.0021,5.916,2.2858,1.792,3.1327,0.829,0.2416,9.3382,1.3387,1.5432,3.9544,1.4993,1.6244,0.0602,0.0026,0.0304,1.2919,3.3256,2.089,1.9347,2.2864,3.5887,1.8738,1.4743,1.5042,1.1914,3.1455,2.1608,0.1498,1.7928,1.4133,2.5739,4.5084,2.0726,2.4168,2.6315,0.9554,1.0676,1.8826,2.1744,5.2072,0.4484,1.6962,2.6751,3.2455,3.4789,3.4708,0.0099,3.5467,0.2418,0.8142,0.9125,1.5697,2.0746,0.7501,0.9879,5.4427,1.8718,2.4066,0.9331,0.8242,0.0002,2.0501,1.0647,0.13,0.0023,0.0011,0.0012,0.0039,0.2402,0.4407,0.0041,0.5023,6.889,3.5893,0.3846,1.2368,0.0019,1.9239,16.9106,9.6637,7.6945,3.803,7.9786,5.4832,6.9082,3.6913,4.0289,5.8765,6.3993,1.4306,2.6576,3.3643,2.3896,4.2538,3.2824,5.7986,5.4212,4.5299,0.9527,6.1148,0.5796,3.5219,1.0297,0.4734,3.4078,1.0777,1.6874,3.0421,0.0006,1.5639,2.3549,6.6689,3.3293,7.5499,0.3646,1.3949,2.8091,5.9574,0.9829,1.8252,1.5035,4.5819,0.5228,3.786,2.4912,1.135,0.3235,3.2986,1.7625,2.0637,0.0209,2.104,0.1732,5.8451,2.0493,5.6142,0.1524,0.6172,3.4854,0.7838,2.2086,1.9187,6.1672,4.6246,1.6692,1.2359,4.3399,0.1978,0.6576,0.3104,0.7961]}

{"id":1280,"ended":true,"length":344,"text":"Burns can be very painful and a number of different options may be used for pain management. These include simple analgesics ( such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen ) and opioids such as morphine.\n\nThe most commonly prescribed analgesics range from morphine to a combination of painkillers, sometimes including painkillers (the painkillers used by nurses), anesthesiologists, pain therapists, painkillers and medication. But there are also countless methods of pain relief, including oral analgesics such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen. These medications are safe, don\u2019t make you sick and can help to decrease the pain and give you plenty of energy. You can learn as much from your own perspective as possible by browsing our patient care guide.\n\nThe average patient may get a painless injection on average every two to six weeks for some pain management medications. However, a painkiller injection can be really painful. Many patients will get pain when they are injected with either painkillers or non-painkillers that is very different from what is actually required. The reason pain medications are known for pain is because they are often given by non-treatment providers. Some pain medications or painkillers only take a few weeks and work for a time. There is always the possibility that a treatment will not work exactly as you expected.\n\nAnother reason for people to use pain medications is to help combat pain, not just avoid it. Because you take these medications almost daily, you can probably rely on the painkillers as long as they are still present. There are many other medications for pain. Some other medicines cause pain too which can cause discomfort.\n\nMany pain medications are commonly available and cost money. However, the drug manufacturers usually charge a reasonable price and the drug is known to have a good reputation.\n\nIf you have had some of these drugs administered, take steps to avoid pain.","token_len":385,"entropy":[4.7073,6.277,1.577,5.0587,5.8811,2.2917,4.4128,6.5466,0.0179,5.064,4.9387,3.7795,0.4273,3.1113,2.6426,3.3199,1.983,0.523,4.0543,1.1025,6.4757,4.3877,0.3079,2.2313,8.4813,0.0035,2.1669,0.0074,0.0,0.0001,2.5915,3.468,0.0087,0.0,0.4909,1.0374,6.0836,2.3558,0.0009,1.7897,1.8693,1.5374,0.0103,2.8405,2.9041,2.6058,2.3011,1.6688,1.0709,7.1146,0.143,3.7473,0.7047,3.8576,1.876,0.1291,2.3024,0.905,1.987,5.2108,2.1483,3.2869,0.598,4.2765,5.5087,3.6025,1.4883,2.961,2.0754,6.8811,3.8248,5.9075,5.3258,0.1825,0.0316,0.6202,2.1848,5.5495,0.5453,1.8882,4.5196,2.7499,6.5442,1.523,5.976,1.9972,0.3855,0.9317,8.2798,6.0645,1.3179,1.6546,3.3515,1.5801,1.1002,5.1409,3.1525,0.4011,2.9076,0.0007,3.8954,0.0724,0.0008,1.6269,2.8471,0.008,0.0006,0.001,0.6222,3.6519,4.0055,1.4821,5.3449,1.8288,6.3678,16.3775,8.1799,1.8061,3.9692,0.4026,1.041,1.3993,1.3128,2.0517,3.1007,3.9993,1.2563,2.2388,2.5126,5.465,0.2875,6.3246,0.0278,2.4563,0.7805,4.562,0.8915,3.7984,7.4975,0.126,4.9938,1.6783,1.888,7.2739,0.8041,1.7555,2.5031,6.9031,2.0915,5.8111,2.7871,4.6103,0.6634,0.4169,0.0002,3.1115,5.593,3.6775,4.3415,4.4611,2.2592,3.1214,6.3629,4.5997,4.3288,3.3949,2.2625,2.6487,0.9512,3.14,0.706,3.4211,3.858,1.6476,3.1078,4.513,0.5647,2.5761,0.0377,3.6351,3.4141,2.4096,1.2183,1.1236,1.2194,6.239,1.6929,2.0433,3.9934,1.6125,2.2851,2.8238,2.6249,3.8144,0.4768,1.4389,4.8317,0.5736,4.6524,3.3939,0.1782,0.3949,5.1072,0.3791,0.2738,0.5013,3.9416,6.6193,3.3262,2.6097,0.1942,1.3839,1.7155,3.7428,5.1108,1.3022,3.0123,4.6045,3.84,3.5297,0.697,6.427,2.2261,2.8269,2.0322,0.6087,1.122,0.9626,3.0825,3.162,3.1769,4.8861,0.0279,6.5029,0.8915,1.041,3.4796,1.1459,1.0349,6.0979,1.1077,1.1971,5.376,3.3943,1.1778,0.834,2.5158,3.7102,6.9362,2.0267,0.6245,4.2208,0.9839,4.4194,1.1822,4.3033,1.8803,0.7209,0.5705,1.9257,4.3041,2.9624,1.5476,0.8845,7.352,0.5876,3.5791,2.2352,0.7542,1.2788,0.0001,4.4455,2.53,1.7879,5.5215,0.5704,3.1592,0.5338,0.933,0.3999,1.7289,2.6023,6.9071,1.9381,2.6704,3.1987,1.9139,4.7812,0.419,0.1627,5.1719,4.1202,5.2582,4.6403,0.342,5.094,1.298,0.5318,1.3366,1.7459,5.4395,7.2358,0.0835,2.8367,1.857,2.5668,3.3209,3.9075,0.0393,1.6894,0.7056,4.909,3.7811,0.5893,3.8815,0.5598,1.4551,2.1026,3.1546,3.7431,0.6509,3.3526,2.6739,4.9819,3.7377,6.2791,1.2973,4.1062,6.1074,1.2591,2.0579,3.8338,1.2908,1.7062,0.0002,3.6974,1.5916,0.5721,1.3597,5.4722,4.7008,3.9458,3.6102,2.7189,0.677,2.5358,0.076,3.2371,4.9315,3.4932,3.726,3.0438,1.6414,4.3996,0.7787,3.2339,2.9554,3.1567,1.6239,5.4151,0.8344,2.8328,1.5232,2.0555,2.4381,0.4218,2.5586,0.0002,3.0833,0.2279,1.6114,4.3014,3.464,3.3072,1.0428,2.8843,7.3473,2.6324,4.1273,5.3219,0.0754,1.632,3.7104,1.334]}

Las Vegas, then a small city of some 5 @, @ 000, saw between 10,000 \u2013 20,000 deaths each year. Not sure a dam was needed.\n\nSo what happened? It all started while a small group of young women, including one from Las Vegas who turned out to be members of the LDS church, did the work. They started raising money for the church\u2019s mission, and they helped to build the dam and make sure our town was safe and secure. The dam was approved and was later opened up for construction.\n\nHere is an old video of the dam (one that I use to support my own faith). It wasn\u2019t done as much to help those who lived near the town; it has become a place to pray and receive the good news. Thank you to those who came out to prayer times and to people willing to get in the heart of our community. Thank you to those who made our community safer and happy. Thank you also to those who went out to do the work and volunteered for the project or had their support of the group. I will be updating this update every day with the progress being made and the community receiving the information needed to build safely, secure and prosper.\n\nSo I thought I\u2019d share a video of my own prayer times. Here is the video to you. I know I have a lot of other pictures to share about praying and church life this year but I will share the video in this blog.

{"id":1776,"ended":false,"length":317,"text":"In November 1125 Taizong ordered his armies to attack the Song. The defection of Zhang Jue two years earlier served as the casus belli. Two armies were sent to capture the major cities in the area, the main city itself serving as a base for the three armies. The attack led to huge destruction, causing the southern border of the Song to be sealed out, the major cities of the south to be cut off and the Song city of the west to be completely destroyed. The southern border has since been maintained, allowing the Chinese army to enter Song and make their way through into North-West Territories, and the new strategic alignment between the two regions makes for better border control.\n\nChina's policy of establishing special military positions on the eastern side had led them to establish the Dalian-Zhou military line to enter Song. The position is part of the Beijing-Zhou military line which entered North-West Territories in the 1930s, though more than a dozen soldiers were killed in the fall and winter conflicts in China's north. In 1950, China established Taiwan as its representative province, also as an independent country that followed the principle of direct foreign military ties, or military unification. The eastern front of China's north has become a long and complicated, inter-provincial dispute.\n\nTao Tzu-Hai\n\nTao Tzu-Hai (12 May 1680 \u2013 11 December 1901) was a Chinese writer. He was a close confidant of the late Emperor Zao Guangjie (1789\u20131822). He also wrote of the Han Dynasty and Dynasty of the Cunun dynasty (1811\u20131812). His work was translated by the Chinese scholar Zhang Heng.

{"id":1954,"ended":true,"length":320,"text":"The internal structures of the crest of Corythosaurus are quite complex, making possible a call that could be used for warning or attracting a mate. Nasal passageways of Corythosaurus, as well as the head crest, are known to be of interest, in a variety of ways. The eye and head of Corythosaurus are visible at two different points of view, including one of the dorsal and one of the proximal (i.e. thoracic) edges, with both the eye and the head being visible through one of the vertebrae at this point.\n\nThe internal structures of the crest and body of Corythosaurus are not simple. The crest faces two different ways, one of which has a ventricle with the eyes of the back and the other one of which has a ventricle to the neck. The eye is shown at the back, with a dorsal projection towards the posterior section while the head is shown in the proximal section.\n\nBoth ventricles (front and back) are visible below both the dorsal and the dorsal edges.\n\nThe mouth also shows an anterior ventricle, with a ventricle to the breast and anterior ventricle to the stomach.\n\nIn addition to the anterior ventricle, the crest has two anterior ventricles. The first, that which points to the back, is generally located at an angle to the front. If it is facing the back at all, the third one is generally present and therefore has a ventricle to the stomach.\n\nCorythosaurus of the genus Corythosaurus are closely allied to the Corythidae and therefore the genus Corythosaurus is closely linked to the genus Corythinosaur. In the genus Corythosaurus, each of the dorsal and the distal ventricles have two head and both have a ventricle to the chest.","token_len":385,"entropy":[9.0014,6.1267,0.6306,0.8496,12.0451,2.1033,10.3023,3.5546,4.4972,1.8232,4.4514,3.4918,0.9804,4.9203,6.6285,2.5502,9.4382,5.531,2.5995,1.7378,2.2172,2.17,8.8451,3.0052,9.2383,3.3233,5.5778,0.5126,11.4774,1.742,8.5451,0.3115,0.011,3.4709,3.217,0.0253,0.0487,3.5848,3.3348,0.7481,0.0014,1.3935,5.7645,4.2965,0.9857,1.3491,3.4795,0.5102,1.2559,5.0022,3.5651,2.4469,4.7714,4.4693,3.2095,0.0005,1.3704,0.557,1.9392,7.3092,3.109,3.8233,3.1218,0.4911,0.0083,0.0026,1.3327,5.2259,2.8929,5.8255,2.1157,1.6148,3.2336,2.4522,0.9357,5.7318,2.794,2.7063,0.4442,4.0021,2.3347,4.0179,0.0164,0.0154,7.0074,0.0221,4.3802,4.527,0.0188,0.0014,1.2651,6.6291,0.5607,0.0399,0.2942,4.0546,2.2213,3.445,3.7968,2.7341,3.6018,0.5313,0.781,1.3772,4.0341,1.7763,4.1846,5.0619,0.6469,0.2431,6.6659,0.1525,0.0145,3.6857,4.9162,0.9167,0.5728,2.4729,0.0044,1.6241,5.3496,0.7857,0.0945,1.3828,0.4058,3.6303,4.6373,0.6681,0.0689,0.0043,0.0011,0.5097,3.552,5.0967,1.598,1.3259,2.8789,5.9308,5.6464,2.4964,3.7477,1.276,3.3664,1.5327,0.6436,3.4348,1.0688,5.3423,3.9301,0.1182,3.3052,2.5911,4.1834,3.8564,0.6684,5.8256,1.7665,0.9154,0.3245,2.8836,3.7007,0.9858,0.5714,0.4508,0.5897,0.1423,0.0299,5.123,0.2409,5.1059,0.7321,0.9255,6.2122,1.7154,5.2933,2.1805,0.7962,3.6144,1.5247,2.3206,2.2561,2.176,6.2509,4.8198,0.0748,4.6025,5.861,5.7045,0.1364,0.8177,0.6204,0.8381,2.1459,0.4327,5.8378,0.0079,2.4052,0.4081,2.6187,0.0002,4.4343,4.7891,0.0589,0.0952,4.0803,4.1161,0.4588,0.8168,0.1787,0.8771,2.7533,6.1582,4.4736,1.3844,1.3344,0.5858,1.5921,2.0255,3.2909,1.4096,2.6037,0.0002,0.8439,5.37,5.4405,2.3663,3.2756,4.261,4.0412,0.1557,0.0123,1.7926,1.9577,1.1501,1.364,0.2399,0.0532,1.2648,0.0676,7.4517,1.8459,5.4981,1.5739,0.0105,0.2621,0.3136,0.0434,4.1879,0.3793,0.9625,0.0002,3.6136,1.9739,0.5665,0.6724,5.1247,1.1986,0.0053,0.0977,0.3313,0.5923,4.7036,2.599,1.6127,4.5716,2.3258,0.0251,0.167,2.2074,0.9128,3.1046,3.2075,5.2732,4.5442,6.1284,1.5029,0.1384,2.5487,1.0334,0.6911,6.4472,3.5609,1.4738,4.8505,0.4987,1.8406,0.1,2.4418,1.9817,5.893,3.0698,0.5051,3.9615,1.7285,2.0299,5.0992,1.9242,0.153,1.1892,5.8687,4.4071,0.7569,3.8411,5.3495,3.7499,5.2873,3.8517,0.8813,2.3997,0.0619,0.044,0.6445,0.0548,3.6586,0.5689,1.0529,0.0002,3.7229,0.205,0.0034,0.0354,6.081,1.0875,3.1597,1.8643,0.2947,0.3644,4.9357,5.9562,6.3731,0.6065,1.0139,4.999,0.3735,4.5312,2.5349,6.1474,3.2261,5.0369,0.6062,0.143,1.2866,1.0491,3.877,4.9473,0.3223,0.8576,1.3691,0.1893,0.1034,6.0804,7.5984,3.2266,2.1676,2.1845,0.5654,0.0105,0.6221,0.5025,4.8508,1.1112,0.2661,3.4511,0.5758,1.8118,3.3622,0.0305,4.0973,0.0735,0.0736,2.9965,2.9299,6.8078,2.5708,4.611,1.8371,0.9714,0.8853,0.0283,0.0263,0.5894,0.0414,4.1216,0.4461]}

At the time, he was working as an English teacher in Plze\u0148, Czech Republic, and had no professional experience with film editing.\n\nHarm\u00e1\u010dek decided to concentrate on creating a new style of films, based mainly on photography and video, while continuing a small artistic career. His first film, the film A Life in the North (1990) was nominated for an Academy Award. He was hired by Studio 8 on the role of a painter who then hired himself as the director of this film.\n\nAt Studio 8, he decided and directed the film, which opened in 1989. On October 3, 1989, he participated in the premiere of the film The Death of a Director, where he won the Jury Award for Best Director. He was not only nominated for the Jury Award but has also won various awards for photography, screenwriting, music, and illustration.\n\nOn May 25, 1990, in order for the project to proceed, he was in Czechoslovakia where he directed the film Tommie in 1990. He won the prize for \"Best Director\". He ended up working for 10 or so companies in the Czech Film Production and Theater Guild in the Czech Republic. In the film, he was playing one part; one where Tommie is a young orphan. He was in danger of getting his hands on all the footage of his character because he wanted to try to use it in various locations. But he was too intimidated to want to use this footage. He decided to use it for his first film, The Death of a Director (1991), at the age of 28-years-old.\n\nIn 1994, the director decided to adapt Tommie into the Czech filmography and the film made a significant impact. Three years later, it was adapted into the film The Death of a Director.","token_len":385,"entropy":[8.3761,12.2075,7.0877,2.6442,7.6882,7.6841,2.6008,4.2029,11.6597,2.1362,3.8724,1.1589,4.4017,0.6975,0.8189,0.3643,1.2872,1.2473,2.6754,1.6112,1.6495,4.7685,0.6038,1.3769,8.3011,9.1067,0.4998,2.9714,1.4059,3.0186,0.4321,0.9895,1.1747,1.9122,3.6604,5.1837,0.8076,2.7354,6.127,5.2681,0.4847,1.6682,0.003,5.3188,0.0351,0.002,0.0053,0.0007,3.8448,0.1593,5.7116,0.2473,3.5763,1.9487,2.0106,2.9135,0.2579,4.5041,1.7515,3.9325,5.2381,0.0476,6.6726,1.5516,3.4383,1.987,4.7049,3.9037,5.0963,5.0954,5.2027,3.3235,0.7664,2.9771,1.7224,1.3128,0.5433,3.6749,3.8029,4.639,6.1817,1.263,1.8592,6.1807,2.7163,4.2232,2.1418,0.9291,3.6066,0.0908,1.2866,0.6751,0.037,1.9419,2.0552,2.3762,4.8501,1.0409,5.6573,4.1811,4.6827,1.7044,6.1787,0.1237,3.3736,5.8836,3.5983,6.0013,4.8918,5.6229,1.5525,2.3042,1.5397,1.1125,3.9327,0.8134,0.3817,1.1367,0.0001,4.12,2.0877,0.0501,0.3706,1.2691,4.1807,8.2314,3.8563,1.3452,2.1029,2.9785,1.8112,5.2059,0.6976,5.4709,0.8329,5.2706,3.9117,3.5413,0.6301,1.7496,0.0869,1.4815,7.1011,0.0723,0.9406,3.4638,0.1073,0.7279,0.7431,4.4751,5.6748,0.3486,2.9527,6.4818,1.5832,3.3592,0.2948,3.3917,0.8829,4.783,2.5116,0.8361,0.4644,1.1294,0.6236,1.8297,1.7475,4.9619,2.3057,1.5221,0.3841,1.4231,1.6623,0.3801,1.6483,6.0311,1.4048,1.1895,4.5118,0.3959,1.6277,6.8846,0.8887,5.4629,0.3585,0.4328,2.7132,0.4865,1.0926,5.5721,0.2681,0.7509,0.0001,3.7037,3.1549,3.4228,0.0372,1.0826,0.0778,4.3349,4.7671,3.6891,1.2508,4.1454,0.0419,3.7481,0.5296,1.2811,2.1008,5.3414,3.8929,0.4787,0.0112,4.9534,0.3256,4.6167,1.2405,1.0505,5.4981,5.8898,2.341,5.2728,6.0929,0.5116,1.8269,4.0494,0.6081,5.1759,0.3744,4.4354,1.6198,1.7597,2.2154,2.0308,6.2622,0.4713,2.2733,2.351,6.6355,6.3785,1.7731,5.0521,1.695,1.1158,0.802,5.8288,4.4526,3.188,7.4751,4.9189,2.8612,1.7187,1.0005,0.1299,0.9881,2.7425,2.3606,3.1371,0.6967,0.7281,2.3977,5.4305,5.0621,7.3812,5.8449,4.0231,7.153,5.8954,0.0211,0.0041,1.5617,2.503,2.7216,5.3343,2.3699,1.7513,1.6237,4.1258,5.5973,0.2538,3.5111,3.172,1.7987,0.7084,4.8132,0.889,5.0593,2.0423,1.7803,2.9019,4.1111,1.1696,3.5422,0.2817,5.1456,0.9811,4.6107,1.6389,1.6986,5.7788,5.5064,0.7703,4.6537,1.5336,1.6567,3.1127,5.2474,1.2182,7.0952,0.1621,2.2383,3.4994,0.1508,1.8066,1.741,2.5017,0.2243,2.0403,1.5952,1.8022,1.1514,4.3168,1.2122,0.668,1.9557,2.4354,0.0158,0.1058,0.1446,2.6368,1.3971,0.9378,5.6852,0.8674,2.4359,0.0054,4.3812,5.9513,1.4094,0.3544,0.0075,0.196,0.7286,0.0001,1.8523,3.4729,0.1127,2.7435,2.8279,4.222,0.1202,5.6381,3.0385,0.02,0.0036,2.0998,2.7514,4.266,2.1116,6.8031,2.3949,3.8169,2.409,4.7616,2.5447,5.3277,0.7397,1.7014,6.5321,0.7907,0.1943,0.1843,3.8731,0.6526,4.4504,0.2558,1.2891,1.7164,1.4333,1.5603,0.0073,0.0671,0.0467,2.0357]}

{"id":1270,"ended":false,"length":344,"text":"USS Ericsson ( Destroyer No. 56 \/ DD @ - @ 56 ) was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding of Camden, New Jersey, in November 1913 and launched in August 1916. Ericsson received a new name, after her original name, 'Crown Princess, the Royal Destroyer', as a result of a two year battle between the two ships, the Destroyer and 'Cannes Princes' (which had no relation). The squadron lost the battle with her on the final leg of her deployment, in December 1914, in which she fought alongside a crew of four Australian, French, and Japanese ships. Ericsson was one of four surviving ships in the battle.\n\nOn 14 June 1916, after the war, Ericsson was decommissioned and was replaced by the US destroyer, as requested. After the war, the Destroyer was reassembled with her replacement, and re-assembled with a crew of seven Australian, French, and Japanese ships, in order for the ship to re-integrate in service as both a destroyer and a carrier.\n\nIn August 1919, after the war, Ericsson was renamed the Princess. She was commissioned as a ship in June 1912, and she joined the United States fleet in July 1919, with her crew of two sailors and three ships in tow.\n\nFollowing the war, in 1920, the vessel was decommissioned, and was replaced with the new destroyer, the USS Gerald E. Ford (DDG # 2 \/ DD 23 ). On 31 January 1922, it replaced the destroyer, but also became part of the USS Ronald Reagan (DDG # 1 \/ DD 30 ).\n\nAs of 2014, the destroyer was operational in the U.S. Navy and NATO nations. Ericsson is designated as a U.S. Navy Class Type-A Destroyer by both the White House and the Defense Department.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links","token_len":386,"entropy":[10.2451,5.0835,3.6581,16.3591,8.0513,0.0696,6.2859,5.0353,5.8973,9.8403,6.9215,7.8695,7.2192,3.5946,4.6346,7.0721,0.3697,2.0209,1.4777,7.5346,1.1553,7.1426,1.008,7.046,10.9065,1.083,1.5394,0.0366,1.6186,2.5628,3.6467,6.4605,2.7998,5.7134,2.3446,3.8288,3.5715,0.4781,7.6341,0.0017,5.4034,1.534,5.0477,3.5503,1.8321,5.2385,5.6813,3.3914,1.0427,1.058,5.2857,4.614,3.7637,3.9993,5.2061,4.041,4.5855,4.8317,1.8198,2.8712,2.1893,1.9053,0.044,2.3469,6.3293,2.4788,2.4463,3.2767,0.7903,2.6419,1.6064,2.2295,3.0342,4.6313,3.4436,5.8846,1.8851,6.8976,4.3843,7.0003,0.013,1.4656,1.0254,4.782,3.5348,4.5905,4.2043,2.7355,1.5226,7.7372,6.0298,3.0087,1.3836,4.292,4.4391,4.0722,2.493,4.452,5.4679,0.2902,2.4512,4.8976,1.7467,3.6774,3.4664,2.2439,1.2518,4.0523,3.2514,1.1335,6.7494,2.9217,3.3221,4.9666,0.0639,3.3824,8.3876,3.75,3.1276,0.9207,0.8083,3.2813,3.169,0.5823,3.6715,0.0016,1.0387,3.8171,0.0095,3.2988,5.4195,2.657,2.4731,0.5067,5.8511,1.4791,1.5029,0.043,4.1071,4.2672,2.8578,1.3718,0.4118,3.9482,1.8044,4.157,1.5692,1.8783,0.001,0.9151,4.8611,0.0003,0.0002,1.7194,3.2488,3.055,0.1524,0.9645,5.3808,3.6686,1.9652,7.0775,6.4545,2.3318,4.114,1.4018,1.0892,0.2323,1.66,4.6081,0.9311,3.001,3.0641,2.9628,2.5415,4.0318,1.2439,3.3923,4.0388,0.6023,2.8605,0.9838,2.7873,2.698,0.0486,3.1636,1.911,0.5651,0.5865,0.161,0.1914,0.0391,0.917,1.7893,3.1163,3.6002,4.2093,1.3106,3.4097,0.0977,4.3494,0.2579,4.0141,0.0022,3.1112,1.3764,3.4416,6.1277,0.5169,1.8518,0.0713,0.9959,3.2165,0.3359,1.332,0.0002,2.4267,3.1557,3.376,0.1871,3.0277,1.1396,0.6991,0.2408,1.4184,0.0011,0.4725,4.2919,1.6379,5.7281,4.1441,2.1749,0.5941,3.0107,1.5164,0.9267,4.6605,2.2976,4.08,5.028,1.1959,1.0703,3.3743,4.625,0.3037,4.7133,0.0418,3.1643,1.0875,2.6377,2.9718,1.6925,2.8075,1.9375,3.7195,1.0328,3.6416,5.4565,1.6561,2.349,4.4103,3.4414,1.5827,0.2499,1.2614,0.0002,5.0186,0.5499,1.4209,0.1601,3.9822,3.4083,0.308,1.1791,6.0335,0.5574,2.7403,0.0032,0.0002,1.5082,0.6678,2.221,1.1525,1.904,0.6592,3.4463,3.6575,0.3205,0.6625,2.942,4.9205,5.5243,0.38,1.4237,0.9872,0.4251,2.4454,3.1097,5.2908,1.2488,1.371,8.7078,1.9828,4.0499,3.858,2.3097,2.2153,0.0944,3.2658,6.1542,0.6156,3.0215,1.1918,5.079,5.1705,2.4633,2.5477,0.0034,0.1731,2.3205,4.553,0.2156,0.2308,0.1495,0.248,0.136,2.6202,0.1743,0.303,4.369,0.4787,0.9908,0.0002,4.9129,1.3445,4.6732,0.3097,0.8178,3.2673,2.1816,5.22,1.9443,0.903,3.5502,0.0031,0.009,0.1237,0.7111,3.2192,7.007,6.4789,0.9736,4.6594,0.0026,2.0412,5.7559,1.3474,0.8041,3.2727,0.0057,0.0028,0.0678,0.8948,4.7214,5.8376,3.4598,2.5243,4.0286,3.2679,5.3376,0.2976,5.4969,0.0187,0.2338,0.6628,3.3303,0.3104,0.5468,1.0287,0.0003,3.5366,1.3941,0.0004,5.0364,0.7744]}

He demanded that their kings deliver 1000 gold leaves, each worth 15,000 gold, in a new exchange of gold leaves. The King's father, the King, took off his gold, and they made two attempts to exchange the gold leaves, the king's only remaining gold. But when the Queen of Kaqchikels had lost the gold leaves, the king had to leave his gold and buy the next one from the Crown. The Queen promised the Crown to make a gift and help the poor, while the King wanted 300 gold leaves. But the King only gave 150 of the 300 leaves. The King ordered that each leaves should be given and the king sent him 500. The Queen requested that the King be allowed to give his gold and the King received 750.\n\nIn the following days, the Queen sent out a letter informing the King and the King that the King and his children will be sent to spend a month at Kaqchikels in the mountains of South Africa. The King sent the two sons to visit Kaqchikels and learn their culture, language and customs. They were shocked and disappointed when the King visited them without explaining what they were doing. It is estimated that the King sent half a million gold leaves to the King. When their country was attacked in the first days of April, the King tried to bring their people out of this country... But when they were still in their country, King came to them only with the promise that he would return them to their land. He made them promise the King to give a hundred gold leaves. They were disappointed when they saw that the King was now asking for money and that they would receive only 250 left. But King had already promised to send 500,000 leaves to the King.","token_len":386,"entropy":[6.3197,5.7749,5.5634,2.0488,0.1936,13.8225,4.3554,1.0985,8.2594,8.1126,2.7843,9.4782,5.1312,1.2443,11.1719,7.0359,8.052,6.5016,5.2996,1.3915,14.3911,1.153,1.0507,4.7216,0.9,0.7003,1.3739,3.0307,0.4332,4.7235,5.2127,1.1423,3.2187,5.3269,7.0192,8.6577,2.1444,8.0315,2.6202,5.3837,2.5741,4.1562,0.886,0.0453,2.1149,1.621,3.3644,3.2213,5.6964,5.1329,2.761,1.78,4.0252,1.1253,1.5033,3.7937,3.3083,5.4638,1.386,2.435,2.0829,5.0751,4.5907,5.5221,0.5513,3.4103,3.7887,1.0736,5.1117,4.2885,5.0638,6.4194,0.6117,2.4131,2.2416,3.7757,0.3297,1.4862,3.3476,3.7091,2.9427,4.9068,4.9122,2.824,2.2482,3.1025,2.8823,0.7505,4.5535,2.1406,4.1644,0.1327,0.0289,0.062,0.7176,4.7953,5.0451,2.4098,1.9839,0.2866,0.4816,1.0202,2.1326,3.7656,1.5923,3.6639,2.5502,0.7881,2.8222,5.4798,1.7992,5.8959,2.881,2.8824,0.5874,6.3274,1.9484,1.5143,1.4739,5.9514,2.8068,2.4346,2.1379,3.9355,1.7935,3.831,5.0298,6.5105,1.0614,5.7888,2.5442,4.1998,0.6075,0.4193,5.3555,7.3021,0.8548,0.0516,1.4726,3.9073,1.0182,1.2058,5.7242,2.3626,4.624,2.7295,1.4882,4.8664,0.3935,1.8064,1.2541,1.4226,4.6562,2.5663,4.4456,3.2928,3.0646,0.148,2.0733,5.3562,2.1534,4.0173,3.1018,3.7334,4.5427,3.2044,1.1277,1.2864,6.0184,0.9236,0.7914,0.816,3.5176,2.9753,0.2902,2.8642,3.4967,3.1752,2.9102,2.9404,0.817,3.6231,5.8617,2.7626,2.2235,0.0364,2.846,1.5443,3.0475,1.7656,0.5565,0.7266,2.7165,3.6173,3.224,1.851,3.2379,6.1925,0.5037,1.8331,2.569,1.6954,2.1505,3.1379,1.2554,2.0182,3.2326,1.4563,4.1209,5.2503,0.9159,3.1708,0.9152,6.2171,3.0303,1.7641,2.6374,2.4972,0.0706,0.0172,0.0063,0.3738,2.9732,1.9528,4.2051,1.3184,4.1644,1.5437,0.8774,1.0358,0.9495,2.5908,1.6144,4.0307,3.2212,1.6804,2.3631,3.0789,0.0138,0.0067,0.0029,0.0198,1.7554,5.2136,3.9176,2.9794,1.5926,4.6649,0.9983,0.7756,0.4415,2.722,1.6403,6.9807,2.0617,4.068,1.9939,1.1282,0.7109,5.0576,2.1521,5.6568,6.7651,1.7708,1.3437,0.8573,0.7211,0.5073,4.8868,2.0734,3.3954,0.086,1.6968,0.7874,3.4717,4.722,0.8701,0.5874,1.0314,0.0615,0.7064,0.6321,2.1234,2.665,3.9184,5.0998,4.9355,1.0629,2.5569,3.3885,1.2734,3.5316,3.145,0.3776,4.8938,0.4825,0.8273,0.635,6.2399,0.1328,4.8358,4.2592,2.2674,3.6419,0.4784,4.7506,3.6417,8.9895,3.2076,2.1997,1.6448,2.3088,5.3217,1.5952,2.6297,1.3407,0.2992,5.6674,6.8871,0.8811,0.936,6.5862,3.306,2.0347,2.015,1.1425,1.0868,0.1704,2.6597,1.3069,0.6602,0.7835,2.7449,0.7058,2.5768,4.3764,1.8678,3.5665,4.694,2.2128,1.9568,2.6187,5.2627,3.9806,2.0667,0.0433,2.0086,3.0136,1.5604,3.8069,1.5153,1.4501,3.0979,1.3775,0.8727,0.1599,2.1339,5.5644,4.8105,0.934,4.5351,1.8411,2.5727,1.3968,1.4472,2.4275,3.3204,3.8754,5.5207,0.5898,3.507,2.4526,3.9099,2.7659,2.1987,1.3467,2.4006,3.5458,4.0256,1.3398,0.3883,1.3059,0.5057,0.5827,1.1087]}

{"id":1990,"ended":true,"length":346,"text":"The closely related species Verpa conica typically has a smooth cap, although specimens with wrinkled caps are known. V. conica may be distinguished microscopically by its eight @ - @ spored asci. V. conica is a common species of Verpa conica that can be distinguished by the smooth curve of the upper end of the cap.\nIt may also be possible to identify specimens with an upper \"f\" at the tip of the cap (or slightly greater length). Some specimens may be easily identified by their \"s\" (or \"t\"), while others are very distinct (f1,f7 andf9).\nThe lower end of the cap has only two spored cells. These spored cells are known as \"F6\" cells and are very sensitive to pH changes. The topmost cap cell is usually described as \"F8\" cells and are similar to \"F7\" cells but a \"spored\" cap cell has more spored cell in it. These spored cells are known as \"6\" cells.\nAs may be expected from these specimens, the upper cap cells may have different characteristics regarding the pH level. As can be seen in some specimens of Verpa conica, the cap cell can react in a pH mode, resulting in a higher rise in pH than that reported in the lower cap cells. This means that higher pH can lead to an increase in the total pH value of the end cap cell. This increase in the pH could increase the difficulty in controlling the level of germination and eventually, spoilage. In some spored cell specimens, spored cells may produce more germination (f11) than the lower end of the cap cell.\nIt may be possible to distinguish between vias (spred cells and spored cells) where cells are spored, by detecting the number of spored cells in each vial.","token_len":386,"entropy":[10.5108,2.0476,6.2667,7.8659,8.1504,8.1853,3.6781,7.8016,2.9658,1.0922,5.8116,7.1084,2.2893,4.8104,6.2955,2.504,5.6516,0.216,3.2762,1.9324,2.9698,3.0465,6.1646,2.0216,0.8962,0.0126,3.9585,1.0481,3.1238,14.0524,0.0038,0.0006,1.9511,1.4235,9.2514,12.7505,5.5924,6.4184,5.7291,10.1068,8.1197,5.4995,6.3276,3.5987,0.0329,0.2348,0.0026,1.1527,2.1125,3.0962,2.4948,1.3378,3.7354,0.1021,0.7088,0.0087,2.907,3.0217,0.3389,1.2977,1.5655,1.8665,5.5245,7.4974,0.6153,0.9411,4.5793,4.3405,0.4568,0.6592,0.9979,0.618,2.4415,9.4764,3.3444,1.4152,0.0881,5.1679,0.2218,3.0191,2.5934,1.0703,4.4302,4.7879,6.315,4.8554,3.0608,4.0863,0.3764,3.0648,0.4961,0.093,0.4086,3.6151,3.9244,6.1894,5.7185,6.0825,1.6566,4.3088,0.7254,2.0301,1.4146,4.8911,1.9675,1.1634,2.5006,3.9597,4.5178,0.425,2.2598,2.4478,1.3768,1.8262,2.6296,1.5857,0.1562,1.9066,4.0144,5.1826,3.4452,5.5091,5.1269,1.2033,2.8964,5.1294,3.9487,3.49,1.7964,0.4934,1.1928,2.1179,5.3419,1.4388,0.1373,0.13,0.28,3.1032,5.5001,2.0062,0.9243,0.9528,7.3355,1.9275,3.3906,2.0554,0.3892,0.1804,0.9408,4.5353,0.4548,1.6324,5.6823,4.955,0.8996,1.0964,2.0323,0.9053,4.3832,3.8425,0.0959,4.7647,2.1373,0.7063,1.9283,5.5809,2.5031,3.115,4.9021,1.312,4.1356,4.9231,0.1822,1.2825,1.0197,2.2175,0.5156,2.555,1.7887,3.0777,5.1769,0.4297,1.9887,0.4023,1.6675,0.2712,0.1411,2.0267,5.4248,3.5527,6.2608,0.6153,0.3398,2.6349,1.703,2.7492,3.2985,1.1213,0.0704,2.9253,4.9633,1.5371,0.568,3.1877,1.2289,0.0397,0.2507,0.9536,1.8751,0.2139,0.3718,7.1958,0.3056,0.2573,1.614,0.9129,5.0397,6.5368,0.0775,1.3715,1.8047,3.1557,3.3946,0.1378,1.3868,2.7317,2.7617,3.6717,3.0718,1.4054,3.9676,4.109,7.6711,2.3433,1.6383,3.589,1.0825,3.6089,2.6022,0.0628,0.3487,1.2437,4.1965,1.1205,3.5496,1.8356,0.0087,0.0606,0.0026,0.3525,0.8344,2.7959,2.5419,3.6588,6.312,4.1938,1.4261,4.681,8.1624,2.8041,4.0091,0.0024,1.1052,3.0489,8.1581,0.6527,0.3803,2.2777,3.5785,5.1817,1.2143,1.509,3.6147,1.075,1.8105,0.2815,2.1884,4.1546,0.2053,3.4414,0.2823,3.2067,2.2035,0.0086,2.9531,1.1515,0.0468,1.3688,5.3404,1.6619,5.3254,1.0076,0.1865,6.5601,0.4547,1.4544,0.5625,2.3667,3.2824,0.7185,2.2054,0.9991,4.7043,4.7482,0.2728,8.3006,1.4733,5.4752,1.097,5.2499,0.0566,9.2226,0.4118,2.0376,5.0839,3.5191,6.7499,0.0185,0.8006,3.1471,1.7411,10.0702,0.4404,4.3668,1.5089,0.2875,5.5524,0.3922,0.5491,1.226,4.4865,2.9429,2.6585,0.136,3.7216,2.7823,4.8239,2.1075,0.5813,2.2733,1.4682,1.4549,0.9817,0.0381,0.0732,2.121,0.5905,1.1752,3.7509,2.3286,0.8279,1.0797,0.1472,1.5062,2.4108,6.3923,8.7752,3.0274,3.7873,9.874,3.4994,4.8208,2.0995,1.003,0.3301,0.334,6.8928,7.143,1.6223,2.7866,1.6882,2.2505,5.6644,6.847,1.0012,4.4432,0.1279,0.6209,0.1526,0.4661,1.2545,1.9648,4.0529,3.7131,0.759]}

The use of these horns is not entirely clear ; several interpretations have revolved around use in ritualistic rites, such as bibri.\n\nCarnotaurus and Cernotaurus are known as bipedal apes of the Vigus-Symphony tree, as well as the more widespread (i.e. Vigus-Mongrel tree) and the more distant (i.e. Vigus-Leucoptera) animal classifications.\n\nOther groups\n\nScythers\nCernotaurus has two horns. Cernotaurus has two horns on its forearms that are very long and very long.\n\nThe most famous kind of Cernotaurus is the one in his backside, named after his head. Most often it is called the cernotus or cernotaurus in many cultures, especially the European speaking ones. It can be seen in the chest and legs, with their horn-like bodies and the horns sticking out vertically. The long horns usually belong to a cervus (bone of the back and legs).

It was released by the publisher Moritz Schauenburg at the time Pope Pius IX proclaimed the dogma of the Faith of the Jesuit. The book was criticized by a leading Catholic church and by the conservative Catholic clergy. It was adapted into a two-part series in 1976 by the Vatican-State newspaper L'Apostle Saint Antonius.\n\nThe book had its beginning with Pope Pius XII\u2019s introduction, then it spread from the Vatican into numerous countries. It led into Europe and into the US and into the German territories of Poland, Bavaria, and Bavaria. Pope Pius XIII had said that Catholic believers should use the term \u201cfaith\u201d because the Catholic Church was a religion to all those who lived in its territory. The idea was to introduce a new way of thinking about Catholics by promoting the beliefs of the Church, as in the case of St. Peter the Apostle (1906\u20131990) or St. Joseph (1938\u20131953).\n\nThe book was promoted as a \"Christian Book with Holy Liturgy\", and thus it had broad support among Catholics, some mainly Orthodox, some Protestants, and others Jews, Jews, Muslims, and Christians.\n\nSt. Antonius, a faithful Catholic priest in many countries, especially in his home of Ostph\u00e4\u00e4n, was a leading supporter of the Catholic belief in the Sacred Sacrament. He and his fellow members of the St. Peter\u2019s Gospel Church in Ostph\u00e4\u00e4n, where St. Antonius was the pastor (1997\u20132011) were invited into a program to be performed by the St. Peter\u2019s Gospel Church in Ostph\u00e4\u00e4n.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBook of St. Antonius of Padua Catholic book\n","token_len":388,"entropy":[10.1263,9.895,3.4292,2.9058,4.956,0.0274,3.0047,14.6483,6.3366,1.7952,2.2292,8.3084,0.9801,5.5972,4.1843,0.0764,3.068,12.4354,1.3682,11.4151,6.5972,5.5725,4.0418,4.1727,2.8426,6.1849,2.8984,1.141,5.4092,8.0735,1.2885,3.7887,4.9706,6.9075,4.1329,0.5406,3.7925,6.189,2.3429,0.0018,1.7884,5.4409,1.2397,5.503,0.4517,0.9032,5.4233,1.3615,0.686,10.1533,3.4147,2.1877,1.2883,1.5872,5.5404,0.7232,3.4626,3.5992,1.1897,4.5583,2.938,3.0147,1.6546,5.3397,1.5222,5.0342,1.0265,2.1919,0.8085,6.4912,1.303,0.6787,5.8975,0.3471,2.1986,1.7478,1.9829,5.1832,1.7602,1.6235,3.7797,3.4602,9.2812,5.1051,4.113,0.1546,3.1227,5.1077,1.0054,7.2226,4.4954,0.2984,1.1349,1.7264,0.1358,1.8993,1.3641,4.9034,2.8218,4.2445,1.8243,3.4449,0.4053,0.0009,2.0091,12.4599,7.7631,4.7466,6.575,2.6474,5.5309,3.5084,3.4297,4.1325,2.3159,2.2611,3.6492,5.3159,2.8108,1.3833,1.5745,5.8911,4.3799,4.4767,1.26,2.1273,0.9149,4.0064,2.1521,3.4784,1.1846,5.8797,4.6389,1.684,3.6114,0.8401,6.3299,0.0001,0.406,1.0949,2.2939,0.0414,0.4717,4.2917,0.1313,0.0006,3.5296,3.9714,5.0994,1.0022,4.088,4.2285,1.2578,5.5102,1.1511,4.8709,8.2581,5.4001,6.5387,2.204,7.1844,3.4838,2.3998,3.0294,0.6707,1.7729,2.6641,3.9557,5.1463,4.7912,4.3672,0.326,4.7082,0.9745,2.8803,2.2697,0.486,1.8766,4.7906,1.4904,1.5333,4.9395,1.5954,0.9452,2.8744,0.1293,1.3902,1.2227,5.7025,3.904,5.1302,1.2057,6.3359,0.2666,0.9712,2.3095,2.4433,3.4652,4.3717,0.7,1.4256,0.0252,3.5103,0.3508,2.9753,3.0218,0.7892,3.1528,6.4882,3.5184,2.0856,4.9846,1.3462,3.7777,1.1347,0.0032,4.7403,1.3804,0.9573,4.7374,0.0296,2.8522,3.3905,0.5227,1.1649,0.0002,1.4328,1.0628,1.3497,5.9348,2.2179,0.6973,3.7864,3.8722,5.3835,5.5998,6.1683,8.239,0.2599,2.993,2.132,5.7218,2.1714,3.4211,6.3206,2.3961,1.3199,1.7112,2.1421,4.6276,7.4568,6.0292,1.1781,1.3735,4.3216,0.4846,0.6451,2.6997,4.5493,2.2504,4.0974,1.2492,3.464,0.0913,0.8245,1.5328,0.2546,2.2109,0.0002,5.2652,0.1445,2.6743,0.0176,3.0449,2.97,6.172,1.4064,2.8547,2.9098,6.6169,1.7087,0.3922,6.5249,0.7451,3.8697,2.3639,3.7876,6.6947,11.2552,3.2721,6.9953,2.0671,2.9047,1.9638,2.1976,3.1091,4.9889,0.1209,0.473,2.3911,4.5874,0.9667,0.4993,6.3948,8.5118,0.7577,1.0998,5.3717,0.7958,3.3139,3.8072,1.3991,0.407,3.3222,0.0887,2.8029,11.7583,0.4275,0.2223,7.5355,2.2521,2.2978,2.2374,0.0275,0.006,1.6595,0.0056,2.1583,3.9731,1.5236,0.0064,0.5987,0.0063,1.2013,2.9774,3.4627,4.4796,7.359,0.7303,3.7675,2.0095,2.4379,4.4009,4.7283,2.4733,6.3407,2.0218,4.3328,5.0665,1.1608,0.8875,1.692,0.0366,1.0727,2.1052,0.0041,0.0175,2.0304,0.0878,1.0657,2.11,0.0303,0.0032,0.011,0.0025,1.1415,1.2711,0.0002,6.7309,0.8034,0.0003,6.348,0.6242,0.6441,0.0003,5.9104,2.642,1.8909,0.0681,0.6138,0.006,2.674,0.0637,0.0011,5.6657,5.7294,2.7512]}
{"id":2106,"ended":true,"length":337,"text":"Portugal designated Mozambique an overseas territory in 1951 in order to show to the world that the colony had a greater autonomy. It was called the Overseas Province of Mozambique ( Prov\u00edncia < unkapito> on the Portuguese-Portuguese treaty of 1832). Then in 1950, the Portuguese declared that it would take Mozambique as an overseas territory, including the Portuguese Islands, as well as the Brazilian islands (i.e. \"the islands\" above). In addition, the Portuguese had declared neutrality for Mozambique, and the Portuguese had provided support.\n\nThe Portuguese government granted Mozambique the protection of Portuguese consular authorities due to Mozambique's neutrality. However, Mozambique refused to issue Portuguese passports to Portuguese soldiers, as in previous decades. In October 1953 as a result of disagreements with Mozambique over the Portuguese ownership of the island of Vila Vinha, Portugal became a \"regional territory\", meaning that Portuguese citizens could live in Mozambique without the Portuguese control. Instead, Portuguese soldiers were allowed to roam the island without authorization.\n\nThe Portuguese government later granted Mozambique the right to retain all Portuguese nationals, or consul-general for Portugal. Portugal also became a \"regional territory\" meaning that Portuguese citizens without Portuguese knowledge residing on either side of the Portuguese frontier were obliged to obtain a Portuguese passport.\n\nPortugal officially became an independent state in 1956. Its citizens, although not all members, were legally allowed out of Portuguese territory while Portuguese troops served on the island. Since 1956, the Portuguese also granted Portuguese citizenship to most citizens living on either side of the Portuguese frontier. Portuguese officials allowed Portuguese passports to Portugal citizens living on either side of the Portuguese frontier. In the beginning of the 1960s and 1970s, the Portuguese government provided more than 100,000 Portuguese citizens with Portuguese passports, many of them Portuguese women.","token_len":388,"entropy":[10.719,12.4453,11.4194,0.1943,0.0296,4.7981,6.4693,1.0201,2.008,5.6763,4.8758,1.8176,0.0243,6.8273,5.4196,0.5807,1.5295,0.3777,1.8352,5.1727,2.2123,3.015,5.4958,5.4789,2.366,3.0777,1.5206,6.0592,1.5177,7.0556,0.0008,3.8532,0.8406,0.7319,0.001,0.0013,2.6158,12.0985,6.1142,5.7149,0.0867,10.1044,9.9805,7.2401,4.6186,8.1791,3.6868,6.2842,1.7593,3.8383,2.8371,4.1793,0.1391,0.0055,5.7439,2.1158,1.8851,5.4468,1.009,7.1444,1.1913,4.6792,0.9203,1.4221,1.2682,4.3702,2.5953,2.4888,1.8981,3.9989,3.7104,0.0011,0.0087,3.5205,1.931,2.6117,0.1883,2.07,5.9972,1.8774,4.6508,5.359,1.3908,3.5102,1.1437,0.0203,1.3735,5.5603,2.6616,2.7911,6.3269,0.0044,0.0004,0.9661,5.701,2.7227,3.0504,2.7731,6.9646,1.2982,2.2909,4.4364,0.2916,1.3516,0.3112,3.2806,2.5806,6.3434,2.5149,2.4115,0.002,0.0464,1.932,1.8155,2.2971,1.1967,2.2724,5.2052,4.7489,4.1414,1.6542,0.0067,1.903,1.3714,2.9412,5.698,0.9067,0.0007,0.0093,2.1751,5.9354,0.1881,3.7331,6.3434,0.6146,3.5632,6.9663,0.0359,3.7566,0.0085,0.0563,0.1877,3.4688,1.1995,2.8229,0.0138,2.426,0.0004,0.0049,3.2441,0.2576,5.9323,4.2936,0.4415,1.0081,2.1904,6.4883,2.0883,2.9324,5.174,4.6112,3.5234,1.4958,2.0211,5.2159,3.6806,8.222,1.497,0.4947,0.4683,8.1761,1.72,2.3538,0.001,0.0089,1.5031,1.0072,3.1733,6.7851,0.0596,0.8039,3.4184,1.0674,5.6105,2.8274,7.0176,4.2484,0.5312,2.6311,4.8162,2.0345,4.2603,6.888,0.0745,3.0031,2.8984,3.6597,0.5609,2.2392,1.9287,1.6798,3.8429,0.9744,2.201,0.0002,0.0012,1.537,3.3256,2.0631,6.3219,0.3569,6.8131,0.2592,0.6545,2.5819,1.0756,1.2948,0.1035,5.1689,1.2866,1.4576,2.4123,4.8759,1.2141,1.3997,0.0002,2.1043,0.4582,1.3152,4.627,3.534,0.937,0.0005,0.0029,0.8871,1.6524,0.0997,5.1777,3.5997,0.9732,2.6859,2.3336,5.3518,5.4018,4.9938,0.8815,0.6886,4.1639,4.2157,1.2656,4.0971,2.5753,3.5067,0.9202,1.6704,1.55,0.0023,0.4453,0.3827,7.9452,0.1319,0.585,0.499,6.1787,0.5475,7.9135,8.2419,3.4524,5.7349,1.3501,0.079,0.2486,1.7426,4.7239,2.3508,5.8945,0.0337,4.7058,2.7119,0.6829,0.1851,1.0226,1.5062,0.0002,2.6879,0.179,4.7386,2.4231,1.6316,1.4884,1.3852,0.3633,3.4005,0.9531,4.7762,3.4342,3.3233,5.3896,1.3351,4.5735,4.817,2.1057,1.1649,4.6943,3.0162,9.6931,0.2846,2.9927,0.1337,6.2703,1.7979,3.7165,5.6643,1.8831,0.8428,1.2554,0.6662,4.893,2.2933,0.3861,1.9656,0.1675,6.1888,3.4112,1.3773,1.8605,0.4197,5.3676,3.9073,3.1078,0.9982,1.9413,0.0374,0.0304,0.2776,0.2761,0.1544,0.5672,3.4965,4.5711,5.2228,0.9999,4.8838,0.3872,5.472,1.9314,2.0726,0.6681,0.687,0.0302,0.0427,0.1522,0.1491,0.0772,1.1479,2.5743,3.424,5.4365,0.44,1.3627,2.0841,0.0504,3.211,0.8228,0.014,0.1695,1.6487,0.1041,0.7733,3.8106,4.6597,1.4211,2.4247,0.343,0.0029,0.4858,0.9328,0.466,1.2631,0.2989,1.3059,4.0697,0.1601,0.7683,1.7644,4.9832,0.8702]}

As they approached Ives, he asked them to take him to the country of Ojai, while Whipple and Wipeout kept him out of the way while their expedition was underway. Ives asked the Indians to leave him at home so he could not be hunted. Ives refused to leave and ordered that Whipple and Ives make their way north into Ojai to find and locate the Indians. Whipple and Ives were given only two days to cross the Colorado Rockies before they had to turn south to get to Ojai. Then the group reached the US border to find Ives\u2019s body. The body was deposited in a military cache along the Rio Grande. Whipple and Ives were later captured and brought back to Egypt.\n\nAlfred L.

{"id":3626,"ended":true,"length":316,"text":"The new name of Osijek first appeared in 1196. The center of medieval Osijek was on the banks of the River Drava where Tvr\u0111a now stands. The town was a trade and port in the center of the town between 1206 and 1140 BC. Osijek was the first town to be built, and is a small settlement, probably in the middle of the village, that was built by an emissary of the city of Osijek (ca. 1204-1169 B.C., and likely later named Osijek), and was known as the largest trading settlement on the island.\n\nIt was occupied until about 1430 BC by two merchants who settled Osijek. One had acquired the village from a slave trader, and the other was a native of the island. These two merchants lived in a town called Osijek and were named after Osijek. The Osijek settlement remained in use until about 1460 BC when it was moved to a more powerful market and was renamed Osijek Osijek.\n\nThe village of Osijek was annexed into the town by the king in 1464. Osijek had been governed by the kings of Osijek until the 13th century when the king, as a ruling power in the town, removed the village from the king's hands and took it over to the royal prince of Osijek, his chief of staff. At the court of Jutun Osijek the village was named after him after a king who was married to this man. During the reign of Princess Osijek, which lasted from 1246 to 1311, the village was under a king named the king of Osijek and in 1314, by the name of Jutun Osijek, the village was annexed to the king of Osijek, king of Osijek.","token_len":389,"entropy":[5.7977,6.1009,2.4873,9.7063,7.1446,3.8356,8.3211,1.1032,0.573,11.3809,2.1834,2.33,2.0566,8.47,0.9716,9.4244,4.1523,0.0701,0.0194,1.2757,5.6289,0.5035,4.3289,0.0071,0.1727,2.4585,4.8576,6.7379,1.7798,5.3869,7.1217,9.1744,5.1771,3.0354,3.3118,7.0534,0.4816,0.4948,1.7685,4.2829,1.185,3.6357,6.2264,3.819,5.6769,4.5322,0.693,6.6506,0.1282,0.779,4.4537,4.6747,3.0102,4.808,0.1541,4.0748,3.5441,3.4185,0.4095,3.6524,0.0074,0.0024,0.9122,2.0302,2.711,2.5484,1.3652,1.7516,1.6208,3.9834,1.7396,3.6223,3.7331,4.1528,3.2181,3.3284,5.0841,2.9429,0.7128,2.7236,0.083,0.5356,4.7664,1.8775,3.5188,1.5633,2.5353,2.0597,3.6996,4.7807,2.4322,0.0157,1.018,1.0324,4.73,1.7006,3.8853,0.1147,0.0215,3.2376,6.3456,0.1428,1.2055,3.8237,0.8192,1.9279,5.3383,3.8768,0.0007,0.0205,4.945,3.2722,6.5863,3.3656,5.4531,2.4211,0.2439,0.2482,3.4632,2.2048,2.0988,4.1996,0.9456,0.9943,5.7839,3.447,3.0923,2.6093,0.562,3.4705,1.3323,1.6653,0.0177,4.2613,1.0306,6.2178,4.3062,2.8583,3.508,3.176,2.7054,0.8751,4.4139,3.5146,2.3149,3.2396,6.4693,0.0071,0.0055,2.0771,2.3592,6.1707,5.3988,1.3245,4.3547,2.4014,1.809,5.1178,1.358,1.8349,1.1907,0.8222,0.0991,1.9476,1.8521,4.8558,0.3643,0.9646,2.6019,0.6672,4.5985,1.3695,0.3078,4.6171,0.8118,1.8547,3.5248,0.712,2.42,0.0976,0.0736,2.5582,2.0442,4.7328,3.0921,2.4492,0.0237,0.0634,2.3336,1.3801,4.0012,0.0091,0.0113,4.1179,6.1943,1.945,2.0548,0.3326,1.3203,0.9862,2.8787,1.4313,1.5799,2.1636,0.2391,4.0302,0.478,1.9451,4.0582,5.8275,6.2101,3.2812,2.7267,3.1034,0.9724,0.0619,0.0626,7.5021,0.118,0.1425,0.835,1.2227,0.0002,1.4265,3.8419,1.5506,0.1179,0.0048,0.0021,0.9269,6.1899,3.6957,0.3921,6.8615,3.6113,0.7604,3.2917,2.782,1.1808,4.162,0.934,3.8274,0.0036,0.0028,3.3902,1.3924,5.224,0.5574,1.3879,3.9356,0.6355,5.1557,0.0647,0.0323,2.5499,1.3995,4.4504,0.3856,0.1548,2.6212,0.9183,1.3095,3.4441,4.4297,1.7753,6.4268,2.8224,3.0769,0.4333,1.8514,0.1013,3.7709,1.1596,3.4609,1.4711,0.9419,3.2484,0.3714,2.2958,1.2769,3.5393,1.9735,0.9447,0.5258,0.7528,4.6283,6.6183,2.34,1.7358,0.007,0.0027,2.0479,5.226,5.8151,2.2052,0.5813,0.7072,4.5747,1.0771,5.6923,0.2502,6.1625,4.4638,5.2398,6.841,0.0092,0.0045,3.4244,5.4491,0.6384,3.4428,1.1387,2.2036,5.988,2.6999,2.6406,1.1821,1.6822,6.332,0.218,5.4432,3.7661,0.8099,4.5822,0.4858,0.5393,0.0805,9.2099,3.0647,0.0138,0.004,1.1657,4.4222,0.776,0.6634,2.568,4.5173,0.4575,2.0048,4.0268,1.1382,0.7535,2.497,0.5687,4.6739,3.3905,2.8573,1.3609,3.8838,1.8728,0.5067,1.5645,0.0138,0.005,2.5342,4.6439,2.3781,3.6406,2.5334,5.5953,1.346,3.1822,0.0315,2.4832,0.5528,0.0503,2.133,0.0112,0.0071,0.5698,1.3801,2.1455,0.4524,2.9542,1.1536,0.2537,0.4101,1.4804,0.6909,0.0067,0.0021,2.5724,5.1039,0.0655,2.827,0.0101,0.0064,1.4544]}

The ruins of a Roman castle of the castle have since been repurposed in many churches, and the ruins of a Byzantine monastery have also been recovered, which may have been abandoned.\n\nThe Romans have been known to have brought the ruins of a Roman city to Athens or had them stored there for centuries. The great Roman city of Rome was destroyed in the 1650s without ever knowing how much it lost. The ruins were found in numerous cities in Rome in the Middle Ages.\n\nHistorians estimate that around 3,000 years ago the Roman city of Olympia fell to the emperor Alexander of Greece, whose empire was shaken by the devastation of the city, but also by the loss of most of the city which served as the primary centre of the empire. Some historians believe that the destruction of the city from the Greek standpoint in the 1650s contributed to the city's abandonment by the British forces. They also claim that the city of Olympia was also damaged from the storm of Athens.","token_len":389,"entropy":[2.3183,6.9504,11.8433,0.355,8.2701,0.4898,11.2495,5.0793,3.3407,6.6117,4.1427,0.6639,1.9851,4.716,0.207,7.0571,3.4503,0.1425,2.677,0.5461,7.309,0.0612,6.2972,0.9859,7.6579,0.108,8.5937,9.1482,1.1671,1.4432,4.4491,2.4297,1.9244,3.0494,3.2925,13.8395,10.6239,8.1821,4.724,10.8887,1.8232,4.568,10.1202,1.5168,7.2511,3.1445,3.4554,7.0362,1.7634,4.4714,0.4062,3.5633,2.2585,2.3747,3.2875,4.0187,3.3674,2.2527,0.3823,5.1619,5.1372,5.364,1.5266,5.8907,3.3837,1.0504,4.9859,1.4618,0.9395,2.7162,0.6551,3.4777,0.8606,0.8364,5.0179,11.3133,4.5624,0.141,6.475,1.7643,4.5218,1.092,3.0774,0.0296,3.6871,3.6072,2.0154,5.523,0.2414,2.3217,1.6955,2.4404,3.8686,3.0043,3.3283,1.8532,4.3518,5.79,2.3875,2.4145,1.0906,3.5885,5.4064,0.8182,0.2645,0.5713,6.8709,0.0218,1.6802,6.295,1.1122,0.6478,0.2106,0.2606,0.2123,0.5132,5.8646,0.2563,6.4839,4.8862,1.5028,1.8294,0.0002,1.7702,4.0142,5.8525,7.0841,0.892,0.835,3.0077,2.0645,2.5579,2.4038,2.7952,5.8287,3.79,1.8866,8.987,3.3055,2.2969,4.991,1.6586,2.2117,2.7157,6.5025,3.335,0.1227,0.6898,0.5428,4.9381,5.1198,4.7877,0.3352,9.9852,2.5554,0.0824,6.0691,1.5176,0.3383,0.9631,5.234,0.0881,4.7622,2.5387,1.47,0.0002,1.4595,5.3387,2.9309,4.5142,2.4354,3.7909,6.2663,4.5254,1.3177,1.6141,2.2004,2.0781,1.6431,0.6988,1.3692,1.0515,2.4721,3.6642,3.7568,5.771,0.7616,3.2888,1.786,3.7415,0.5454,4.2677,1.7934,4.3419,4.0309,1.3716,7.2709,6.6053,4.0147,0.1052,5.2523,0.9091,0.0003,2.8722,4.0221,6.3188,1.5553,1.0488,1.4001,2.7334,0.3372,1.5892,3.9158,2.6942,1.5088,1.392,0.0806,4.0552,2.7387,3.7171,3.3091,1.884,0.8827,5.859,2.8671,0.797,0.0002,1.2762,4.2132,2.6005,2.2607,3.9345,0.2903,1.4394,5.6908,2.3556,3.4053,0.1398,2.1872,0.9366,2.1393,1.0364,2.9613,5.8017,6.5532,2.3728,5.2151,1.6159,1.8555,2.902,1.0252,1.7485,5.7721,1.3911,1.9,0.5964,2.7314,1.2624,2.37,1.6199,1.5127,5.8667,4.2642,0.314,7.5724,5.147,4.6166,3.2849,2.8915,1.5125,2.2138,0.8908,1.7419,1.3702,2.5998,2.9015,1.2509,7.1699,3.1307,1.9107,3.8638,3.5085,0.4123,5.4084,0.0214,1.731,0.9485,0.0002,5.0489,1.7393,4.316,0.246,4.3031,3.5928,0.453,0.2579,1.4878,0.3304,1.5607,1.6661,1.7742,0.2943,6.8971,3.3265,1.835,0.4466,6.7937,3.5836,3.9583,3.7343,1.2237,4.1762,3.2968,1.2041,6.9978,0.8315,0.4641,5.2798,0.5238,0.5834,2.2753,2.5593,2.9468,4.7418,0.6354,0.4378,3.3272,0.0268,4.6991,0.148,0.7098,1.9222,5.0672,5.837,0.2061,1.0796,4.7573,4.0785,0.2583,1.0672,0.9253,0.5833,5.5647,1.8926,1.3948,0.2902,0.911,3.3339,0.2904,0.6598,0.6242,5.7222,1.0369,3.9708,6.0037,4.7381,0.873,1.8643,0.3669,0.0149,5.6654,0.3829,0.3421,5.7593,0.5832,5.8872,2.196,0.5596,7.8363,5.4039,1.2845,5.0783,1.7723,2.9844,0.1063,0.7787,2.0349,3.2775,0.9861,0.8782,3.5876,4.1007,3.9968,0.5534,6.4226,1.5398,4.8397,2.231]}
{"id":1895,"ended":false,"length":375,"text":"Condoms are often used in sex education programs, because they have the capability to reduce the chances of pregnancy and the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases when used correctly. A recent American study found that condoms are much more effective than condoms if used properly and can be placed on the body to prevent pregnancy, end pregnancies and end breast cancer.\nSome sex ed programs, such as those used in the New York City Public Schools, focus on male and female performance, with many programs including the American Public School Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science promoting sex education and support for female students and young adults.\nSex education is often neglected because men only have experience when sex is necessary. This is particularly true for young girls that have sex with men and because men have more control over them than women. Many people think that sex education is important because it can help reduce the stigma we face when it comes to having sexual intercourse.\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), men have a 40 percent higher risk of having their sperm count lowered than women do. A recent study found that a healthy sperm count can reduce or even prevent up to 9,000 sperm transmissions to a female per year. In the U.S., about one in three women has sex with men, while about one in five women does not.\nIt is important for sex education programs to encourage young girls to use condoms. Many sex education courses encourage girls to have sex when they are ready to start doing so. Children who use condoms when they are ready to begin sex would prefer abstinence.\nWhile the CDC also recommends that all girls use condoms between a 14 and 20 years of age, research shows that condom use can be the way to increase the likelihood of pregnancy.\nIn this article, I will also share some information about the many steps many sex education programs can take to improve your sex life including the following:","token_len":389,"entropy":[8.4567,2.7467,4.3118,2.0063,1.8631,6.8699,1.2109,2.1659,1.7247,4.5699,0.8855,4.0562,2.0966,5.4651,0.4689,4.326,1.4287,4.3233,0.2268,2.4343,1.5276,2.9504,4.5317,0.0104,6.1401,1.369,0.0025,0.3347,6.2995,1.2876,2.5227,0.2199,4.3925,3.2371,5.9216,1.5357,1.3595,0.1188,2.0489,1.644,4.5937,0.7681,0.1031,0.825,1.0531,4.0708,0.6699,1.9145,2.4858,3.5715,1.3774,5.6189,1.6174,1.4262,2.5433,3.1565,0.6577,1.4501,2.5402,7.7915,6.364,0.9364,5.7236,5.5635,0.3953,0.5611,0.7646,15.9808,3.8328,2.7457,1.9824,3.0222,0.7491,0.0017,2.7681,4.5076,1.197,2.1765,4.9775,0.3994,0.7848,2.5056,0.4048,0.394,4.5973,0.2841,5.9662,2.7264,0.0201,6.7822,2.0506,3.7601,4.0652,3.2214,4.2062,2.9831,4.348,5.2643,1.812,2.8919,2.3816,4.5335,2.0165,1.5025,2.4999,0.8994,0.9519,0.1774,0.0003,0.0022,0.9269,5.0556,3.8209,0.2716,2.4028,6.0383,0.3484,3.371,1.5512,3.1075,3.9202,1.4129,0.2545,0.8299,3.7201,1.2305,1.496,2.3266,6.3051,2.6273,4.404,5.3405,2.6934,7.5362,3.6665,4.6012,1.0887,4.6434,1.2961,3.1166,1.2495,3.0686,0.1347,1.3241,2.733,2.9857,5.7927,2.0338,3.4473,1.2019,0.7613,2.1196,5.1451,2.7892,2.3313,2.6721,3.6811,0.1761,5.519,1.5932,0.6363,0.5295,3.8286,4.4009,2.2997,0.4438,1.7335,0.3021,0.7124,3.7844,1.5798,0.4913,2.9421,1.0492,3.7943,0.8985,4.6964,7.8986,1.0275,1.4602,1.3554,0.2687,0.0034,3.068,3.1991,4.2446,0.5693,1.3506,5.3121,0.0036,1.0177,3.3622,0.0105,0.0562,0.0073,1.3564,0.0071,0.0016,0.0003,0.2846,0.0002,1.4844,0.0012,0.1219,3.5696,2.185,1.7769,4.532,0.8042,0.9908,0.6645,0.188,1.625,4.8027,4.7387,3.9444,4.921,1.1338,0.1106,2.0224,0.6909,3.8127,2.4917,0.6824,1.2449,0.0675,3.3332,5.4696,4.4865,0.1492,2.0516,1.8144,5.3482,1.7421,1.8209,6.6688,0.0021,4.9889,1.6606,0.4353,5.6947,6.8894,3.6966,2.4755,2.9268,4.3236,0.6057,0.4802,3.2781,2.772,1.3286,0.0007,0.0569,0.1326,3.1363,2.6657,0.6461,2.4711,1.0179,2.4679,3.4609,0.3284,1.9048,1.7102,3.1774,1.9938,0.9102,0.1882,1.4115,1.0881,3.6607,0.1467,1.3036,0.9428,4.331,0.3596,0.9581,1.7845,2.9324,1.5532,1.2732,0.1485,3.798,3.3674,1.9255,0.453,3.5809,0.4616,1.5179,3.1018,2.7869,1.744,5.9975,3.9505,1.4762,0.0876,2.7713,0.5588,4.1141,0.3865,0.2874,5.0375,1.532,3.4061,5.5259,0.314,0.6097,6.2429,1.4294,3.7255,0.3345,4.2019,0.1564,0.1401,2.2755,0.6835,2.991,1.4976,6.445,6.6253,5.8151,2.4666,1.5907,4.4611,2.6684,2.3289,5.161,1.5304,0.6522,2.23,3.806,2.3322,0.2019,5.8574,5.601,5.0851,0.767,3.4162,3.2456,2.819,0.0002,0.3203,5.8983,1.229,0.0739,5.4893,0.0349,2.8048,1.741,4.9078,8.3327,0.253,3.1544,1.3235,2.0601,0.1983,2.9095,1.071,2.2106,3.0809,4.3919,1.0177,0.2593,0.9604,0.7265,6.4299,2.7782,1.392,3.0273,0.95,1.8024,4.7782,7.5771,6.3227,1.2378,2.1671,0.5226,1.026,0.0238,0.2042,3.2977,4.112,1.3716,0.0609,6.0493,3.0147,1.8919,0.3452]}

The National Planning and Development Authority is the regulator of the city and the province in which the city is located.\n\nIt is currently being approved by many government departments.","token_len":389,"entropy":[7.821,1.3164,1.0819,10.2111,11.4107,3.4159,6.6264,2.3226,6.4705,0.1445,6.4103,8.9794,1.5907,0.5609,11.7425,12.336,4.8095,6.5543,4.682,2.4201,0.1764,0.6361,5.9032,6.523,3.4647,0.1815,0.0114,0.0082,0.3756,2.2908,1.6041,7.1162,10.867,5.2234,2.5327,3.9453,6.1785,3.5616,5.3067,3.5649,9.355,8.6395,1.7409,8.8643,5.9952,1.0126,10.3344,4.0779,1.5817,4.9226,3.7608,2.375,2.3543,5.8455,5.6441,3.4704,3.7,0.2785,1.0708,7.1483,0.7656,2.6027,0.2568,0.3838,1.3621,0.0035,3.3897,2.96,4.6746,0.4596,0.7328,7.0506,1.0494,1.293,4.7227,4.491,0.2869,5.0551,0.5638,0.9201,5.1512,0.2791,0.6782,1.252,1.8015,2.2306,5.2543,1.2159,4.9513,2.4888,4.5023,5.7473,5.9051,0.6861,1.4081,2.8332,0.6321,6.0681,0.0088,2.4548,0.5303,4.4072,0.2168,4.6926,0.4892,4.841,1.1167,1.9153,0.0025,0.0194,0.7879,3.908,0.1741,0.428,4.8359,3.1819,2.9648,2.6807,2.0061,3.9283,1.2225,0.7103,0.0003,1.3456,2.5024,6.2691,1.452,4.8071,0.5587,2.0445,0.1573,0.337,0.6476,1.1143,2.4065,1.9193,4.4846,7.2083,1.8698,0.9089,4.4721,4.1177,1.978,4.7731,0.1525,5.4971,3.3018,4.4229,1.103,3.4574,2.8118,2.1259,4.8994,4.8679,0.0729,3.3765,1.3128,2.1233,2.672,0.1258,9.4376,2.4613,1.0086,0.0002,3.1648,2.1234,2.1631,0.5482,0.5164,0.9348,5.2728,0.4339,2.1676,5.4769,1.0196,6.1981,4.4401,2.8178,1.9319,0.0986,2.5073,0.407,2.483,0.0959,0.0088,2.5056,2.9768,0.0006,0.5449,0.0197,0.039,0.3992,0.9231,5.9168,2.7434,0.4157,1.7222,0.6162,1.9992,0.2132,0.0062,6.0907,1.1457,4.7332,6.5322,2.7948,4.1294,3.4246,0.4019,3.2234,6.2822,4.2636,0.5251,4.356,2.0424,3.808,0.5656,0.0596,0.6437,1.5886,3.7514,0.3732,0.0002,4.7312,1.4207,2.6641,0.0893,0.0329,0.4805,0.5332,1.9939,5.8982,1.7994,7.6599,2.8968,4.466,2.738,6.2815,5.4994,8.689,0.5576,0.9048,6.8041,3.1977,0.2333,4.434,1.1759,4.8924,3.5922,1.3597,0.7339,1.0461,0.136,5.3166,6.1483,2.9071,0.1687,2.0696,3.8596,2.5753,1.4851,1.0721,3.2143,0.5684,0.0085,4.7978,2.0571,6.7595,0.2545,0.3501,0.0002,5.1496,2.5372,5.352,5.4558,3.8815,5.2103,2.1009,2.4111,2.3427,2.9728,0.909,4.7126,1.0407,0.4779,0.9197,1.4104,0.0165,3.2783,0.3269,4.2939,4.9127,1.366,0.9522,1.4883,0.7766,5.1525,0.0212,0.7191,1.7671,0.0002,2.0067,2.1322,4.9083,1.4254,1.2026,3.6947,3.3319,1.291,1.5041,3.6477,4.7819,1.8235,0.7322,2.1337,0.159,3.0008,4.2843,4.2784,4.2125,0.7705,0.0009,0.0035,0.0065,2.9333,0.4043,0.0002,6.1499,0.3555,4.4496,2.2593,6.767,1.51,3.0249,2.7051,1.9003,0.7266,1.4784,4.3239,1.1967,3.9173,2.8956,4.4019,1.2669,0.6113,4.2282,1.5879,1.2167,0.7023,2.3986,6.0099,1.3824,4.4116,1.4677,2.2671,2.9597,0.3184,0.1671,0.007,0.0541,1.9728,1.9619,6.3259,0.5018,1.3986,2.6622,2.169,2.0085,6.1211,3.3476,0.2486,0.7344,2.0866,0.3651,0.482,0.2336,0.5252,0.0002,4.5752,0.9575,4.2727,3.8384,4.4402,0.4479,7.5528,2.9755,0.9983,1.6709]}

On 30 April 2014, he returned to the top flight due to injury in the 2\u20132 draw with Sheffield United.

{"id":3983,"ended":true,"length":361,"text":"A `` painted vulture `` ( `` Sarcoramphus sacra `` or `` S. papa sacra `` ) is described in William Bartram's notes of his travels in Florida during the 1770s. This bird is one of the best known of the family. It has a long neck and an upright, upright head, black, and red markings. It is an attractive bird, but, if disturbed, can be quite aggressive. A good bird can be found in every corner of the Florida Keys. The flight style has been a little longer than normal, and the plumage has been a very good match for the plumage on the S. papa sacra. A good bird has only two legs. One leg is the left leg, which has a blackish stripe below the middle of it. The eyes are black. The plumage is very different than the one on other bird species, but it is much less aggressive. Only a few adults of the S. papa sacra are in the field, and the feathers are not very blue red, though a few are spotted, but more brown in the mouth. The wing is white. The body is long and blackish brown, or black and brown brownish, some with red markings. The plumage is darker, with larger, more dark spots and black spots where the wings are black, but the coloring is as well. Most of the feathers are white. In addition to the plumage, the head is slightly smaller than that of the S. papa sacra and is of an irregular white color. The upper wing also bears a rather large, very white spot which is similar to the nose of both birds. The feathers are a very smooth blue, or white, or white in the mouth, and the mouth is white and green. The wings are yellow. The feathers have red tips and a light blue color.

{"id":4617,"ended":true,"length":345,"text":"The King's Cross station part of the attraction is built on a site that previously held the Jaws attraction. The entrance to the station, which is a quarter @ - @ scale, takes you on a journey between the south bank of the River Liffey and the junction between the two major trains, the E13 and the V14 (or V8) trains. The journey between the two stations takes 1-2 hours @ 12,500 feet upriver. The station has a 1 meter drop-off point, which means you are not blocked.\n\nThe Jaws attraction opens on the site of the famous river Thames - but you won\u2019t experience Jaws if you\u2019re stuck on the platform at that time.\n\nThe King\u2019s Cross station on the Rotherham line is a bit of a mess on the Rotherham to Sheffield route with trains running a little late out of town due to restrictions, but is in no danger of falling into the Thames River. It takes you through a short area of water around the E12. The station has an incredible range of attractions, with a number of small shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s nearby - and some even offer free Wi-Fi and 24\/7 call centre connections. There is also a mini station just over the edge of the junction.\n\nThere is more than just the Jaws attractions, as the station also contains a number of attractions worth a visit. The station contains the world\u2019s largest underwater tower known as the \u2018The Little Star Ocean\u2019 - which has been on the water for more than 30 years. It\u2019s a world-record underwater waterfall that can be seen from 5.5 miles away and the station is worth a view.\n\nThis attraction is also worth a walk over the waterfall in the morning, so you can get a taste of what awaits when you are in the river.","token_len":390,"entropy":[7.9496,1.7651,5.9817,8.0081,11.2367,1.0756,0.5266,8.0891,1.9523,4.7203,1.9123,1.4943,4.5027,1.9203,5.9884,3.9066,1.217,7.0853,4.8617,3.2252,0.9193,1.6856,4.8709,0.8459,0.2923,1.886,3.3628,1.2476,1.2743,3.3554,6.9165,16.5447,7.1472,5.3594,8.0791,0.561,5.856,1.1467,4.329,0.2998,3.1758,5.4874,0.9818,6.1853,4.4935,0.6751,0.2313,2.0362,4.6891,2.4931,0.027,0.7239,0.5691,5.6758,3.8476,1.1395,3.6113,4.532,6.1763,2.1621,1.5901,5.11,7.0412,0.4878,0.6938,5.5404,4.2031,4.1661,4.6799,2.2732,4.2228,1.8453,1.6221,0.347,1.4899,4.9652,4.4475,0.6208,1.7555,1.7112,1.3337,4.6973,3.5871,0.493,0.4415,8.6174,5.9762,3.7905,5.1531,2.9849,6.1836,4.1244,1.1109,1.4088,2.899,3.0876,1.0677,5.0136,5.1037,5.5234,1.7798,0.3232,1.3544,2.4259,1.5213,3.0383,1.8472,2.9676,2.7563,6.1674,4.1197,1.7097,0.0071,1.4577,3.722,0.0528,1.0749,4.0566,2.0835,2.1223,6.0739,0.3929,0.5128,4.5007,5.8225,5.4875,5.4983,4.4435,3.1188,3.965,16.2241,7.2516,1.1563,6.2185,6.3659,0.0118,4.0614,0.0638,11.4478,0.4457,2.3571,5.5046,1.5506,0.5978,4.8024,3.2168,4.5652,2.1309,0.3009,1.7277,0.0003,1.7527,3.8622,8.2495,0.3585,0.6787,0.0595,0.4501,5.3014,0.3826,5.9342,2.8974,0.1485,4.1044,1.4094,1.87,4.1245,1.4888,0.2128,3.068,4.6245,0.8281,3.1011,0.0278,0.0014,5.9154,6.0639,2.5845,5.581,4.9088,2.3322,4.9295,1.9352,4.1022,6.4877,0.8472,3.178,4.5333,0.0183,8.4188,3.6203,0.9926,3.9715,5.0225,4.252,2.2595,0.5861,3.7679,1.9636,0.8723,1.1151,3.7372,0.6349,2.8422,3.9925,1.8315,2.3723,1.2478,4.1198,5.064,1.1024,5.6099,4.7998,0.7699,5.9935,2.8519,3.7587,1.7615,1.5591,1.9793,2.8743,6.4662,4.9803,0.1265,2.9074,1.3419,3.8211,2.1946,2.8946,0.036,5.2799,3.1793,1.3401,0.9973,0.6255,5.4553,0.0132,5.2793,4.5949,2.3723,4.06,3.7575,3.0258,2.1265,3.0704,0.0155,0.0131,3.3491,6.3264,0.4468,0.0007,5.024,1.7811,4.618,0.4039,2.91,1.0626,0.6777,0.4467,5.7374,4.9252,4.2282,4.1072,0.9401,5.4658,0.3397,0.2716,6.6032,2.5211,0.7336,0.0002,2.792,1.0446,5.909,1.7741,2.5419,2.1845,1.9943,0.0079,3.8705,1.7288,3.3706,1.9225,2.5768,1.84,3.2113,1.2714,1.9666,0.0022,2.6722,5.3188,2.6681,0.4103,0.8206,1.4592,2.9027,4.9364,2.5755,5.0046,7.8434,0.682,0.4681,1.443,7.1282,6.6929,5.7585,0.0732,0.4332,10.4357,5.1507,6.054,6.9421,5.4839,8.913,1.6308,0.7669,2.617,1.684,2.6463,1.6728,4.701,0.8624,2.9246,0.6101,2.5462,0.0053,3.2568,0.1777,1.002,1.6672,6.9787,0.1504,0.0133,1.9307,4.6213,1.1923,5.7822,4.7551,5.6186,2.2328,2.9785,0.8085,0.3798,0.9161,6.8441,2.6219,1.3146,0.8824,1.6793,3.3879,3.6925,3.5377,1.599,5.5072,0.79,5.0937,2.6394,1.0234,0.0002,4.64,3.173,1.1368,2.2264,1.8866,0.4144,4.7088,4.898,1.2791,8.6012,3.5756,0.6486,5.5418,1.7071,4.4074,1.8526,0.9494,2.428,1.2579,3.1071,0.096,1.8872,5.2866,4.0577,0.26,2.8969,2.1717,0.57,4.2941,1.0452]}

At the age of 16, McCain was inducted into the Congressional Hall of Fame.\nAsked about his desire to return home, McCain told The New York Times in July 1972: \"I have always been the type of man who says nothing more out of passion than I do.\"\n\"The reason it is almost true, I think, of the man in the room that we are discussing the war and the war that is being perpetrated, a man who was afraid to do something that would hurt his country, and the way that we talk of this war.\n\"I was able to talk for a long time about it because so many years ago it seemed that it was all a game in the room.\"","token_len":390,"entropy":[6.9927,1.8253,7.283,0.907,0.7544,5.4373,0.0326,14.2736,2.236,0.0674,1.0251,1.7223,2.0384,3.7178,1.8301,6.0685,3.6821,5.0686,5.7422,1.5052,6.7166,8.0848,4.7916,0.0038,3.3387,4.6729,0.0457,2.054,5.5493,5.3949,0.6449,7.4273,4.3921,1.3919,5.8246,1.7571,0.9358,1.7325,0.0106,3.1042,0.1594,2.0447,4.3147,1.062,5.2617,1.2387,0.1714,1.1784,0.0435,1.6348,5.8345,4.8365,4.583,2.283,3.8565,1.6685,0.6848,2.1257,6.4688,6.2096,1.1668,6.5265,4.5339,6.9517,0.3029,1.8744,1.4911,1.9378,2.7784,5.3899,0.7219,2.7415,3.5737,12.18,4.9139,1.1286,4.2602,5.8731,8.2178,0.8053,0.4429,1.7352,4.9105,3.1338,1.6182,2.6324,3.4074,1.9082,3.3883,1.855,4.8223,1.4813,5.3463,0.0292,2.5807,0.0009,0.0008,0.4686,1.6458,5.8493,5.4376,2.6279,2.7926,6.9173,4.8165,4.844,8.313,1.9835,2.337,3.3733,4.9758,3.579,0.9784,0.5859,0.3483,2.1972,3.9937,5.3358,6.1472,0.8908,1.2859,3.4643,0.2762,1.9537,8.4135,0.0004,1.7495,5.9359,4.1775,2.8029,0.6433,0.4508,0.5029,5.2882,3.0894,1.9804,2.309,1.4548,3.2931,4.9797,3.6044,0.7294,1.017,1.7038,4.0678,2.723,5.506,0.0388,1.5204,3.4535,3.0119,3.2416,3.0909,1.7087,1.1969,3.9977,0.7777,3.5984,4.8524,4.3065,5.0617,5.8701,3.947,2.0928,2.1061,1.5684,1.169,2.0841,0.8102,1.7422,0.829,0.3671,1.3931,2.1782,5.6373,6.0636,2.6869,5.4733,4.1476,3.1178,4.3221,2.9242,0.4505,1.3705,3.0464,5.8335,1.1279,5.1353,5.2414,5.5536,0.5527,3.7427,6.2525,4.6015,2.3052,1.1809,1.0474,2.6615,3.13,4.2111,1.5693,0.5396,2.0192,1.5674,2.5769,1.1963,3.9952,2.7085,5.297,1.3326,2.8276,0.9909,6.5036,0.1867,4.212,1.269,6.9738,4.0484,1.4179,2.8594,3.8129,0.2951,0.9092,4.2281,1.2506,4.4052,3.9069,0.0006,3.5432,3.0408,2.2857,2.8059,0.3519,1.3508,4.2702,2.2485,4.0445,0.2742,3.2909,4.9417,4.1277,5.2453,1.3569,4.5727,1.1391,0.8789,1.5161,4.5259,1.1475,2.4394,0.0033,3.4183,0.2802,0.3813,1.8121,5.7991,0.0017,0.0495,0.0335,5.6848,5.0626,0.0369,0.0701,1.9905,1.3357,8.1141,1.3633,0.7392,5.8035,0.1267,2.1757,2.9438,0.9343,0.2115,2.3378,2.2707,2.4274,0.2055,0.081,1.8351,3.2731,3.685,1.1908,0.188,0.6185,2.7236,2.6972,1.6896,4.3799,4.1582,0.3727,1.6122,0.475,4.2842,5.7122,4.8604,8.2364,0.1391,6.5629,0.2607,2.3831,1.7361,2.697,0.4059,2.4798,3.1981,4.3694,4.1719,1.8618,6.0542,7.0341,2.2527,2.0865,2.2656,0.4098,5.1879,2.1205,4.5744,3.5646,1.0659,3.8351,3.7745,3.682,1.9117,4.4891,4.5813,3.417,2.9872,1.0754,2.4791,3.4659,1.9688,2.9284,6.9893,2.4917,6.3904,1.6274,0.8426,2.819,7.5653,1.1828,3.2126,2.0763,1.9886,1.7415,3.5384,1.0709,2.4384,0.7241,2.5848,3.1536,3.7379,1.9073,2.3647,4.1993,3.8321,3.3112,2.0606,5.0157,3.7934,0.3879,1.3515,3.0085,4.9055,0.0325,3.6872,4.979,1.0869,1.2987,0.0574,1.0432,1.7562,2.3772,6.584,0.1589,4.5783,0.8415,3.0572,3.8722,2.0469,2.8459,0.3853,2.8865,2.4165,3.2405,3.7301,1.1031,4.3449,3.0672]}

{"id":4323,"ended":false,"length":361,"text":"Patriotic Civil War tokens typically displayed a patriotic slogan or image on one or both sides. Since the majority of these tokens were minted in Union states, the slogans and images were decidedly different from the traditional Republican\/Democrat party.\n\nThe tokens were minted by the USA at the time, while they were purchased by an exchange in Texas by another party.\n\nIn the 1850s, a bill was passed limiting the number of Union tokens issued by America to 8.6 million. However, Congress approved the proposal, in February 1850. Congress passed the bill and the token was mint and sold by the Texas State Treasury in Texas. On October 3, 1850, the Texas State Treasury said it had acquired American currency tokens that had had the opposite effect because the tokens were made as though they were not American.\n\nSince then, other countries and individuals have come to appreciate the token symbolizing a political culture much more than they do traditional country tokenizing. And in the United States and Canada, tokenizing has become both a phenomenon and a rite of passage.\n\nThe tokenizing of an American token by a token manufacturer has become so commonplace, it has become well known that it has even become a major fashion statement and is a symbol of political opposition and hate.\n\nTao Tzu once wrote,\n\n\u2018We have no more liberty than our freedom, except that we may have it at home, although this freedom is not limited to those States that have been enslaved to him: For this reason it is not true that when I have been emancipated from this slavery which I enjoyed in the world, that I must go to China and learn to be free, since I must be in the power of the people of China. There have been wars, revolutions, revolutions, revolutions, revolutions, but without being slaves, they have never been to China, and neither have they been to the United States.'","token_len":391,"entropy":[7.0173,1.9024,12.2401,1.127,12.9126,8.1795,7.6326,3.4904,8.1231,6.2944,2.7075,5.0805,3.8966,3.6798,2.0225,2.6253,0.8283,2.0563,6.6162,1.2246,7.4529,0.0318,3.1981,0.8357,0.8361,5.4501,0.0046,1.2416,5.8413,3.4704,0.5614,1.6353,8.036,1.2853,0.4809,0.9589,8.8472,3.8921,0.5168,1.0581,3.9216,6.6304,4.1866,3.0432,0.0071,5.8942,3.7403,0.9912,0.0024,1.8212,5.307,0.9847,3.3388,0.0015,2.0097,1.0658,8.0611,4.2147,0.9136,3.0347,2.3003,4.4637,4.0902,0.3128,5.4263,0.9483,5.523,6.1734,2.535,4.8276,5.226,6.6908,3.983,0.6946,2.3049,0.0002,2.9587,1.9833,4.3721,0.185,0.3801,3.0202,5.7444,1.258,1.5086,6.1154,0.4551,1.8818,0.0226,4.7301,4.5658,2.1586,1.8487,7.1354,1.967,4.6848,1.8475,5.9149,0.3271,0.7086,3.3687,0.0343,4.2617,4.2293,1.1068,4.6029,2.9333,4.3719,5.1057,2.482,1.679,4.1699,2.5873,0.7023,0.9503,2.9527,1.6857,3.4036,1.8281,3.0828,12.0971,2.7402,2.3234,0.5864,4.2739,3.2271,3.3516,2.3607,3.5929,0.7787,5.5182,3.0473,3.4903,0.0802,1.3521,0.0589,0.8543,1.9129,1.2006,1.6823,6.8342,1.2468,2.0775,5.6701,6.5247,4.8197,3.6154,2.9643,2.1995,6.2656,3.1341,7.2451,0.903,5.3568,1.4766,2.0086,0.7388,4.52,5.0575,5.6516,0.454,0.4399,4.4272,1.3835,0.6166,0.8647,0.0002,5.3153,2.585,0.0984,5.3164,2.5309,3.6382,3.1111,0.1671,5.4382,1.0011,3.9377,0.5573,3.6604,6.1351,4.0962,2.9902,4.4689,8.2503,6.2302,0.9642,1.066,2.7561,1.6832,4.6786,6.322,5.9164,5.3752,0.333,6.0026,2.7479,1.4965,1.6202,0.0189,4.1868,2.9687,0.1465,4.4225,1.2575,2.7914,0.8967,5.9162,1.1192,7.4028,0.189,0.5185,5.5829,0.0828,0.0033,1.0633,0.4769,0.0002,2.1454,3.1791,5.4405,1.3791,4.5848,0.5487,6.3054,4.262,1.7839,6.4253,5.639,2.4646,1.5721,3.5644,1.5416,3.0157,1.9002,1.3252,0.6461,6.1919,1.3206,0.6158,2.6545,2.1146,4.4393,1.5582,0.8724,5.3039,5.6353,4.0758,3.4753,3.1398,2.7864,1.9826,0.2604,4.4954,6.604,2.8361,6.7335,0.8833,0.6082,0.0002,5.6027,5.4851,2.7304,1.0065,3.8203,1.6117,1.0468,1.8775,0.0005,10.6379,8.0627,5.721,2.2946,2.908,3.8789,5.8207,0.7892,3.1871,4.1126,2.173,5.5286,2.2043,1.2437,1.4262,3.563,2.0288,3.9035,2.4587,1.3463,7.6052,4.1769,3.4803,1.8209,1.707,5.2735,0.4022,3.7239,7.1077,2.8371,1.221,3.4696,6.711,3.9044,7.1095,4.5164,4.65,3.3942,1.5929,3.0164,0.2577,2.4691,5.2439,0.2357,4.9367,3.438,2.678,2.3874,5.1455,0.0007,0.0045,1.3854,3.5315,2.7135,5.95,0.9831,6.5295,2.0469,1.3024,4.5126,0.4407,4.6216,0.4751,5.1359,2.9754,1.1252,2.3501,2.2944,4.3244,1.1598,2.7127,2.4211,1.6331,4.2573,1.2836,3.3843,2.7666,3.513,1.4002,5.2997,0.4173,1.1034,1.4334,3.0096,1.0886,1.5172,5.6842,4.9043,0.3881,5.4095,1.6788,2.8231,0.1629,1.8372,1.0119,0.8714,0.8583,0.673,0.5997,3.6803,5.5944,4.418,3.2206,0.9786,2.5585,1.3546,2.8245,0.6282,4.0131,2.5496,1.4055,1.2513,4.8328,1.0506,0.831,0.9214,0.6374,1.3986,2.4725,0.0033,7.0371]}

As for stones or stones of wood, they were all cut to the right hand side and cut to the other side as well.","token_len":392,"entropy":[7.8746,12.307,6.5199,1.4895,10.0645,0.073,4.3807,5.2305,1.2546,4.4052,3.1829,1.0369,3.6197,0.5471,11.7434,10.903,7.1837,5.6468,5.682,2.1344,2.8634,5.2018,4.9458,4.6666,5.6839,2.6362,3.3433,10.7154,0.0163,0.6228,3.1811,1.6171,3.8928,1.4744,10.0734,0.7003,2.0781,4.5401,2.3881,3.9645,4.5842,2.76,1.2087,0.0295,4.9418,3.0479,1.3082,0.0144,4.8159,4.4693,2.2882,5.9951,1.502,1.4093,2.1677,5.7245,1.9324,3.8478,2.4917,4.6754,1.6379,1.706,4.6446,5.3355,2.282,3.416,4.8129,4.3192,1.2425,2.6101,6.3563,3.4665,1.0717,4.7139,4.2238,0.169,0.4163,1.4898,0.0647,4.3691,4.5825,0.9502,0.372,4.9704,5.0603,0.0137,3.1128,4.1257,0.9134,7.0497,0.3977,1.633,5.9634,6.3314,3.7737,3.8795,0.6892,1.4309,3.1734,3.1896,0.7894,6.3332,0.0622,5.0151,0.5132,6.3102,0.3104,2.2059,2.379,5.573,1.6875,2.1352,4.2192,3.4766,0.3362,0.7788,2.7421,1.4092,2.6946,2.9031,0.736,1.8919,1.3336,2.9805,0.515,1.9494,0.0003,5.6027,4.0102,3.5136,0.7122,3.5886,5.0797,3.9024,0.3337,1.3807,6.6007,4.904,3.3195,4.9596,0.2325,9.3401,4.4994,3.104,4.1987,1.8611,5.318,0.5521,1.5158,5.0495,1.3892,1.2382,2.7992,1.9008,4.7166,6.2727,2.4842,1.9982,0.9697,1.0472,4.984,1.5427,5.6505,5.7837,0.3428,0.9714,0.6102,6.4269,0.6805,4.1103,4.1162,2.3394,4.3969,1.8326,4.4938,4.7934,3.5671,5.1474,1.5572,2.6785,1.4967,0.3255,2.3454,0.2379,4.6421,1.2052,5.575,1.9725,4.406,0.8194,5.5863,1.2551,2.0073,1.9628,1.7848,1.9526,2.8498,1.0753,5.3582,4.8729,3.3367,1.7605,2.8366,3.0715,4.3661,6.1072,2.6909,0.7191,0.9698,3.5107,3.7933,7.3944,0.7736,5.038,1.013,4.4116,2.1197,4.6089,2.809,1.2845,3.5999,1.8145,1.5704,1.4068,2.2587,0.8797,1.0477,3.2354,4.7471,1.306,4.0948,1.8415,4.6825,3.7041,6.1478,6.2316,2.2989,2.2443,4.5946,0.3516,1.8855,0.7968,2.716,4.2647,3.6907,1.7247,2.2265,5.9157,0.8018,2.4981,4.4692,1.389,0.1194,5.8613,0.6228,3.6035,1.6997,0.3549,1.9357,0.0002,3.1277,3.2852,0.1579,0.6016,1.6591,0.4747,1.0745,0.2052,0.4999,0.9897,0.1262,1.1359,0.269,0.0011,0.1529,0.0005,0.1629,0.0392,0.0234,0.2264,0.0739,0.1476,0.1099,0.0261,0.1281,0.1388,0.0063,0.1436,0.0313,0.0141,0.0054,0.001,0.0048,0.0097,0.0018,0.0029,0.0018,0.0018,0.002,0.0008,0.0195,0.0346,0.3738,0.0144,0.0023,0.0057,0.0074,0.0022,0.0069,0.0025,0.008,0.0007,0.0001,0.0013,0.0014,0.002,0.0058,0.0032,0.0032,0.0036,0.0336,0.3334,0.005,0.0263,0.0007,0.0033,0.0596,0.0174,0.0024,0.0147,0.0044,0.0031,0.0276,0.0015,0.0029,0.0013,0.001,0.0008,0.0026,0.0028,0.0079,0.0021,0.0795,0.0007,0.0018,0.0038,0.0073,0.0014,0.0183,0.0106,0.0267,0.0036,0.001,0.0103,0.0099,0.0074,0.0044,0.0073,0.0069,0.0432,0.0008,0.0017,0.0019,0.0024,0.0032,0.2672,0.0028,0.0061,0.0698,0.0046,0.0009,0.001,0.0006,0.0016,0.0117,0.0001,0.0006,0.001,0.0014,0.017,0.0012,0.0011,0.0035,0.0017,0.0012,0.0021,0.0067,0.0033,0.0009,0.0005,0.0013]}

The act also changed the officers required to ensure that the holder received the highest possible degree of coinage. The draft coinage act, amended to conform to the new legislation, made two changes to the Mint-Saving Coinage Act of 1874. The act did not allow for an appropriation for the mint; instead, it required the Mint to submit a budget, budget, and proposal for the acquisition and disposal of certain coins. This act, if approved by the Legislative Assembly, required that all coins accepted for distribution in two denomination coins should be converted into dollar coins when they are issued to patrons of the Mint in accordance with the Act. The act replaced the Act to allow for an appropriation of one part of the Mint-Saving Coinage Act of 1886. The Act also removed the requirement for a tax-refund in order for the mint to obtain coins for distribution in both halves of a coinage.\n\nThe Act increased the total tax rate on coins to 16% of the amount collected from the tax, or 8.3% of the annual gross domestic product. The Act included changes to the tax-refund procedure to allow for a reduction in the maximum amount of revenue collected from the sales of $15,000 coins per coin. In addition, the Act allowed for a limitation on the minimum cost amount collected from the sales of both coins within the time of sale and a limit on the amount of revenue collected from the sale of each coin sold.\n\nA total of 454 million coins (or over a 40% increase in the percentage of coins collected in the period beginning April 1, 1873 and ending April 30, 1878) were minted by the mint in 1886.\n\nThe number of coins minted during the period is shown in the table below.","token_len":392,"entropy":[11.4971,3.0191,5.4859,1.0372,2.1796,4.4542,8.6963,0.531,4.5455,3.6736,0.0029,2.4337,0.0132,1.8509,2.6143,5.8079,3.977,8.862,5.2703,8.7561,5.8999,1.0133,5.2905,12.3923,6.9759,7.0716,6.8358,8.3867,1.5699,1.5378,5.0862,1.5237,3.0163,0.261,10.6525,6.4677,0.278,6.3306,1.3653,1.5926,5.8882,5.3816,1.6135,5.7833,2.1833,6.125,0.0402,1.6356,0.0143,1.1122,1.6169,8.5774,2.0727,0.024,1.2526,3.2198,4.3275,3.0781,3.7324,0.5261,0.4387,1.8748,3.6776,0.4085,4.0331,5.6202,0.8014,0.6327,0.3158,2.8323,6.0921,6.9843,5.7952,4.7733,0.0252,0.2125,0.8303,0.4956,2.3689,0.8048,0.6603,3.6896,5.0321,0.1862,4.2808,2.2049,3.9345,5.8103,1.4623,1.4918,2.4793,4.7935,1.0742,0.2848,0.8491,1.4639,1.1657,1.9565,0.1656,4.4408,1.2167,4.5448,3.7444,6.133,2.4265,1.6461,5.8615,1.1014,1.0641,6.0021,1.8375,4.073,0.0169,5.8852,1.2096,0.9173,3.2481,2.11,3.1649,5.5666,2.9208,0.7512,0.4413,5.0234,0.8398,0.2956,3.8418,2.0072,2.4696,0.8504,6.2681,1.4181,5.0248,1.9798,8.0728,6.1241,3.2102,3.5274,0.2111,5.0763,1.2339,5.7354,2.1936,4.8427,2.376,0.9281,3.1213,2.9127,6.4149,1.5193,0.1647,0.5901,3.8074,3.2507,0.0045,0.5774,4.0438,0.4114,0.8701,1.6539,5.8651,0.3227,4.5325,4.154,2.2366,0.6509,2.7437,0.5499,2.235,4.325,5.634,0.3187,0.7781,0.8959,2.1209,0.1178,0.0036,0.0519,0.0005,0.0747,0.7301,6.4664,1.1249,0.793,2.2146,1.0184,3.8992,0.6928,0.8599,1.1416,1.741,6.9038,3.2639,7.487,0.0083,4.4741,2.5824,2.6743,0.5208,1.7838,0.0816,4.2468,2.7728,1.5146,2.6486,1.2827,4.7331,7.3604,0.593,2.6135,0.3645,1.4368,0.8288,2.9911,0.0024,1.2205,2.7642,5.4195,0.2078,4.6291,6.0239,3.3282,2.6316,1.5898,2.7259,4.9907,1.5294,1.986,0.4986,3.9436,2.9679,1.782,1.2706,6.18,3.7483,4.7118,4.8647,1.3937,2.8667,0.3348,0.3695,0.1916,4.6407,3.6895,3.9855,0.0047,1.0078,0.7557,1.0559,5.2406,4.0058,0.2684,0.5343,4.8561,2.5814,2.6924,0.0015,3.3667,1.9289,1.3203,0.723,1.5827,4.327,0.3121,0.2238,4.1567,1.19,1.0702,4.7577,1.9216,1.066,0.5363,5.7222,1.0495,5.8131,4.2158,1.0199,0.1319,3.4268,2.9497,4.3664,2.9391,4.0184,0.4353,0.1378,0.3559,0.5885,4.047,0.9213,1.2813,6.235,0.5353,0.2977,5.7583,6.2579,6.5277,3.6979,0.9866,0.729,1.7976,0.0222,6.26,2.2139,5.9885,1.2195,4.9142,4.6954,4.5251,2.3335,3.1852,2.696,0.0814,0.1271,1.4937,0.6294,1.5404,0.7671,0.4389,0.4083,0.7676,0.041,4.5618,0.3407,6.4351,1.977,1.2337,0.0002,4.3174,4.4536,0.1157,5.0823,5.9202,3.6899,0.4815,4.4247,3.3783,6.0143,4.3401,5.9758,0.3091,0.9361,1.3452,1.6762,6.3223,0.2779,1.9197,3.2216,2.6621,1.3248,4.8803,4.5576,5.5723,0.2704,0.304,2.0029,2.1924,2.0602,0.1057,0.9884,1.8106,0.0101,0.6,3.3176,0.1528,0.2503,3.2827,0.0034,2.7192,0.3403,1.9908,1.2208,4.4685,0.5371,2.0824,0.0002,1.2061,5.0427,0.0293,0.6265,1.2308,0.0009,3.3905,0.3118,1.2878,4.6509,1.8836,0.4818,0.85,0.8071,0.3496,0.4939]}

{"id":53,"ended":true,"length":317,"text":"Many types of ylides can be prepared with various functional groups both on the anionic carbon center and on the sulfur. The substitution pattern can influence the ease of preparation for the reagents (e.g. the molecular basis of the ligands) as much as physical control, or the amount of the reagent(s) of interest can be kept constant by choosing the desired functional group. For example, any functional group can be substituted with the corresponding molecular structure independently of the other functional group.\nIn addition, many reactive groups can be substituted with one another. For example, methyl substituted aromatic heterocyclic ring and boron substituted aromatic ring(s) can be substituted with one another by substituent groups of the corresponding aromatic ring(s). For example, a cyclooxy derivative can be substituted with a substituted methyl derivative of 1,1-bis[3-(1,1,5-dimethyl)ethyl]piperazine, wherein 1 or 1 is 2, and is optionally substituted with or containing both a halogen atom and a hydroxyl atom independently of the halogen atom. The substituted aliphatic heterocyclic or cyclooxyalkyl group can be substituted with a substituted alkyl group, an alkoxy group, or a substituted alkoxyl group. The substituted aliphatic heterocyclic or cyclooxyalkyl group can be substituted with a suitable halogen atom or hydroxyl atom independently of the halogen atom. The selected hydrogen atom or hydroxyl atom can be substituted with an alcohol group corresponding to 6' hydroxide. The substituted hydrocarbon and\/or hydrocarbon-containing compound (as described above) may be prepared in a liquid or by the preparation of a salt of a compound capable of reactivating the compound such that it is readily reactivated, for example, when water is being added to a diluent as the alcohol.","token_len":392,"entropy":[8.2161,0.1056,9.8808,6.766,13.0862,2.9329,0.5616,6.1902,2.3488,4.1155,9.1056,5.0982,9.4612,3.7593,0.9434,8.0613,5.0357,9.4403,9.951,0.6998,1.3836,0.3676,7.9772,5.5613,1.8334,8.9597,6.2035,3.0971,7.9825,0.4597,8.6923,0.4514,2.5261,3.3026,1.9993,7.0274,1.2645,3.8304,1.9167,0.0013,0.0002,1.7536,3.1729,6.0989,4.5913,0.7147,1.158,7.0063,1.1608,2.0577,3.1052,6.2968,0.013,7.4347,4.9279,3.521,3.9651,2.3078,4.1797,0.0949,3.0128,2.771,1.015,6.4102,0.0225,0.2919,5.1507,2.2265,3.0761,0.9522,5.5026,2.0475,3.8212,5.3242,1.0744,3.3392,3.4596,0.1394,0.7551,3.013,0.4319,0.1888,5.6077,4.4744,0.0941,1.9419,0.3056,2.2195,1.8062,3.4197,4.1841,4.7679,4.4856,8.2112,0.7139,0.695,3.3154,1.351,1.5507,0.7808,1.5486,11.998,2.2301,0.5725,4.4115,4.8591,3.0543,0.9267,0.1774,2.1015,1.2909,4.1959,0.9431,1.8483,1.2625,0.0842,0.084,6.1513,6.779,5.8359,8.2917,0.8,0.2033,0.0987,5.3718,4.3044,4.89,2.6041,0.0311,2.1517,1.1576,0.7256,7.0764,0.1808,0.5471,0.4433,0.2043,0.9169,1.1589,1.7908,0.0783,3.5958,2.8813,5.39,1.6452,5.9715,2.1694,1.826,4.52,3.1015,2.1577,0.8945,0.0066,0.6945,2.8427,0.384,0.0429,3.2974,5.011,2.0743,0.9124,10.9909,2.8483,0.0894,0.3028,0.2695,2.0118,4.6569,4.914,4.9948,1.9842,5.0347,1.0646,3.3138,0.5702,3.7169,3.3532,2.2603,2.9597,2.6414,0.7786,1.6358,1.633,3.2692,0.7044,2.664,0.3174,2.2009,2.6887,1.0641,2.8957,2.0466,1.6402,2.311,5.5477,2.4283,5.701,2.5386,2.8139,5.6567,1.1365,3.3204,3.4784,4.9578,0.2954,0.3545,5.3137,6.9803,5.6159,2.281,6.2927,0.9893,6.2222,0.9513,0.6573,3.1772,0.5552,0.7127,1.5009,8.8908,0.2771,0.6718,3.2838,0.0096,0.8648,0.6523,2.1233,4.2309,5.5167,2.5002,0.0142,4.8814,0.1685,0.0137,0.0266,6.3161,1.055,0.1187,0.0605,8.3039,0.3451,1.7332,0.3802,0.4948,0.9522,0.407,1.4686,1.7494,2.3952,7.7722,0.0274,0.3517,2.3502,4.678,3.1509,3.4242,0.3303,0.3981,0.8398,0.7293,2.4814,3.147,3.8737,0.097,0.0457,0.988,1.81,1.9862,1.2885,0.3017,0.0114,1.6986,0.0068,0.0132,0.0065,0.4819,0.037,0.0048,0.0061,0.0382,0.0061,0.1012,0.1436,0.3952,0.4522,0.136,0.7888,6.2052,3.8481,0.0165,1.1421,2.0517,1.1825,0.0034,0.0077,0.6789,1.2099,0.0264,0.0751,1.4594,0.0023,0.0331,0.4202,1.4946,5.2187,5.8868,1.8165,2.3551,0.3941,0.0019,0.0061,0.3182,0.3062,0.2708,1.1912,0.3094,2.5657,6.7692,2.8424,7.3842,0.0345,8.5595,6.9522,6.2294,0.0499,5.1364,2.1718,1.2084,1.5421,6.2109,2.1715,4.8495,5.422,0.001,4.5645,0.8351,3.8491,2.3729,3.7248,4.7296,4.4533,2.3718,1.1896,0.1026,3.5265,0.4943,3.9284,2.2911,1.5607,4.6446,2.3167,4.1793,3.5703,4.9478,0.1033,1.1292,5.6292,3.4353,2.2093,4.7975,7.4912,0.0187,6.6973,2.1276,1.2521,4.6309,5.654,0.3127,1.9712,1.3773,3.4223,3.4874,0.216,3.4289,3.4604,0.0306,0.8686,3.2302,4.9718,0.4667,5.6115,2.7131,0.5691,1.3036,6.0649,1.6693,0.0335,5.4395,3.7617,5.3231,2.1869]}

{"id":4903,"ended":false,"length":351,"text":"The Amber Room was begun in 1701 with the purpose of being installed at Charlottenburg Palace, the residence of Frederick, the first King of Prussia, at the urging of his second wife, the Duchess, who had been imprisoned there. The Palace was a home of royalty, the country being called by the English of the 16th century, and in 1711, the king was proclaimed royal of the colony of Virginia (which had grown to 12,500 by the 1620's), the most royal state in America.\n\nThe Amber Room was one of the very first rooms in the British Empire to open.\n\nIt was opened in 1701, and only two years old, but quickly became an institution when Frederick  was the duke of Prussia. In his place there was a royal residence as well as a royal court, all in his honor and privilege. The House of House of Pomerantz was also a royal residence, though more than once the Duke was in the presence of his parents and was in court as both a courtier and a minister.\n\nThe Amber Room was closed in 1803 shortly before the 1676 Battle of Waterloo, or Battle of Waterloo, which was a large, protracted conflict between the British and the French, which resulted in the capture and defeat of the French. The battle, which was captured in 1722, killed approximately 300 French men, including 10 British.\n\nIn July 25, 1811, the Amber Room was shut down and replaced with other private spaces of the palace. There were no public rooms for many of the guests, and as a result, many had to sit on the floor or in the corner of the rooms.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\nCharles D.

{"id":3437,"ended":true,"length":359,"text":"In a December 2013 survey of 4 @, @ 205 pay television subscribers, NPD Group found that 21 % of them used a TV Everywhere service at least once per month, and 10 times as often as they did on a monthly basis.\nIn terms of usage, the average pay TV subscriber, 22,974, is spending around $743,000 a month on a TV. But there are also some more common figures for those who prefer to be with a TV. For example, 32,500 are using a Wi-Fi connection with their broadband. And 19,000 are using a Wi-Fi hotspot. That means that these respondents only pay around $10 for a broadband service (i.e., the average broadband user will average about $70 a month) as opposed to nearly twice as much for a similar monthly average of $200.\nOf course, we need to be a little more specific about what they do in comparison to those in the U.S. and Canada. For example, most pay TV subscribers do use Amazon Prime Video. That\u2019s because there are more than a third of those in the U.S. and Canada that use Amazon Prime Video and Netflix.

It was at times that the bishop was placed under the care of the bishops and the parishes.","token_len":394,"entropy":[12.2927,0.6862,0.0007,2.8594,9.9616,1.0873,10.6946,2.5095,8.9787,3.2404,3.7221,2.6193,6.8673,2.921,0.7069,8.154,0.9845,8.2102,1.4347,1.5813,6.2016,0.2246,0.2817,3.7662,0.118,0.5978,8.003,1.863,2.3868,1.6665,1.8266,9.8674,0.1177,1.4949,0.2345,0.2354,1.728,8.3875,2.2219,2.3276,2.3647,1.3434,2.0285,6.3305,4.1434,1.2268,0.1846,0.9907,0.0078,0.3681,1.4165,7.4731,2.5977,1.3513,2.154,3.7672,4.9837,3.1681,2.7839,0.0062,0.3286,4.7984,0.0067,1.8417,5.3363,0.5061,6.2029,3.1098,1.1352,3.2316,1.9706,0.4191,0.9718,1.9983,2.1181,2.7199,1.4866,1.4043,3.5266,6.0044,0.4154,4.3241,0.9392,5.0065,3.7357,1.9929,0.4597,0.6598,1.3948,5.6428,1.596,0.7507,3.0551,0.1288,1.0724,3.495,1.994,1.8866,6.5248,0.061,1.4916,1.1632,2.5427,4.609,0.009,2.3038,4.2244,0.8154,1.2967,3.2756,2.3771,1.3643,4.0701,0.6299,0.6101,1.2696,0.0245,1.6015,5.2747,0.9475,4.5363,3.042,0.0018,0.2204,4.8732,0.0068,0.0321,2.0015,4.4314,0.1973,2.9248,4.5996,1.4747,1.9968,3.4613,2.401,1.0749,0.7728,0.0649,0.3504,6.277,1.1763,6.5205,1.6913,0.0034,2.4127,1.1019,4.5173,3.0954,0.6374,0.5879,3.3508,3.2324,1.777,0.9998,0.6789,2.5412,2.2925,1.1855,5.3451,0.0333,0.2732,1.6138,5.0942,3.7787,5.7735,4.9845,5.1287,0.2257,4.5302,7.4299,0.3797,2.7429,2.2595,3.225,6.5954,0.2693,0.6501,5.2162,0.5302,6.2303,2.959,1.6298,3.7831,4.2014,0.0099,5.3851,0.2946,3.8075,0.6278,0.6562,1.6639,0.3362,3.5612,1.3919,2.3685,4.8953,1.7977,0.4859,5.7604,2.6769,5.2375,4.1936,1.7673,8.1041,1.3682,0.7721,1.3421,2.784,0.2193,5.3878,2.7736,0.2429,0.5835,6.4371,0.0922,1.692,1.4798,6.61,1.676,0.5343,0.9913,0.0776,1.2143,0.072,0.4014,2.2667,0.0429,0.8197,5.4945,7.2201,3.6977,3.4993,0.5753,1.366,0.1522,0.3268,3.8714,0.0458,1.612,3.9747,1.0249,0.0688,6.6299,3.5197,2.6004,0.8197,3.8029,0.0955,5.4199,4.2387,2.2139,3.0721,2.3732,4.2395,6.5526,1.8815,0.5343,4.8132,0.5973,1.3541,3.7607,2.3396,3.6255,0.2758,1.5995,1.1782,1.1716,3.2912,3.8055,0.9686,4.2847,0.8208,3.7334,5.8712,0.4494,0.0605,1.2578,3.7105,0.4726,0.0099,0.1457,2.501,5.6857,7.5986,8.108,1.0836,4.1009,0.7481,3.3538,0.3443,2.9743,0.015,0.2379,1.5128,1.5793,3.6523,0.4592,2.142,0.0012,0.0957,0.6477,0.5329,0.8351,3.9199,0.1138,1.8843,0.4938,0.3474,0.0255,0.2534,0.8142,0.0748,0.0333,0.0034,2.1609,3.4244,2.937,5.422,0.4847,3.5643,0.0216,0.3948,3.2213,4.8305,4.4944,4.4651,4.7521,0.3935,0.818,4.1309,5.0828,0.3934,1.9919,2.7066,0.3884,1.8299,1.9811,1.5368,2.779,0.129,0.3389,0.6864,1.2237,0.862,0.9217,0.8257,2.8788,0.2922,0.089,0.0104,0.0006,0.002,0.0634,0.0025,1.0589,0.5904,0.021,0.0605,0.0048,0.0151,0.0391,0.0101,0.0014,0.0058,0.0594,0.0294,0.0101,0.003,0.0079,0.0215,0.004,0.0544,0.3075,0.0221,0.3602,0.0157,0.005,0.0023,0.0031,0.0022,0.0613,0.0017,0.0018,0.0002,0.0015,0.0021,0.0073,0.0122,0.0109,0.0022,0.0132,0.0079]}
{"id":1345,"ended":true,"length":365,"text":"Aside from humans, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild, although conflicts with other predators or scavengers occur. The Yellowstone National Park ecosystem provides a fruitful microcosm to study interspecies encounters \u2013 and the relationship between species appears to be largely independent of sexual life.\n\nIn a large study, a study of a small group of cubs in Western Sahara, from the southern tip of North Africa, confirmed that the males of wild mice, wild cats, and other mammals experienced greater reproductive success for mating with those of adult cougars in the wild than did those of captive mice. Female female animals and males of adult cougars had nearly the same reproductive success as female mice.\n\nBut the mice and the lion, were the only populations that had observed significant and significant increases in male success. The researchers estimate male success for those of adult cougars was greater than for females.\n\nOverall, the researchers speculate that the increase in male success was linked to higher reproductive success among the adult cougars that were in the wild, while the male success may have been more robust in the captive animals.\n\nTo answer this question, the researchers analyzed DNA sequences from cotaxobacteria in the same specimens to determine whether the mice and the lion, exhibited similar mating rates, or how much success the males reported. They found that while wild mice tended to exhibit more mating success than domesticated animals, cougars exhibited fewer mating success, although this appears to be due to differences in the habitat conditions such as habitat type and how many populations of animals are present in the wild.\n\nOther studies have looked closely at similar cases at other times and found the same trends between species in the wild.\n\nOverall research suggests that the male success increases the probability of mating with females by 30 percent, while the female success increases by 20 percent. The results suggest many potential associations between mating success, population status, and mating success in the wild.","token_len":394,"entropy":[4.2806,9.4629,0.5459,5.636,3.0035,10.2979,0.4729,2.0524,10.3128,11.0263,0.2541,3.9943,1.1726,0.5435,1.6805,4.1676,10.813,2.3442,1.6719,3.1481,4.1064,5.1014,0.1978,4.0108,0.7236,2.7116,8.1028,2.1974,0.0394,5.8724,4.3634,1.9523,9.3223,8.7349,0.587,0.0113,2.3005,3.0998,6.3408,1.4054,5.2226,6.4145,2.1507,2.6091,5.9748,0.2096,3.1836,5.7711,0.2784,0.497,5.0559,5.3111,0.2375,7.2394,8.4478,0.7151,0.8324,0.0004,3.1185,2.9234,5.4419,1.7641,2.0422,3.7438,4.5716,0.944,3.7113,3.6233,1.9086,0.0114,6.691,0.0454,2.1324,5.7522,8.1733,0.9624,6.2169,2.5759,4.9065,2.6047,0.0246,3.7147,0.1627,0.982,5.5787,0.5734,2.0971,3.8033,1.2761,4.1636,6.189,2.8576,4.8992,2.5102,0.7814,0.3995,2.7923,3.1237,6.926,4.7522,4.9271,0.3358,5.0396,3.5039,1.7175,5.068,0.8067,4.7973,1.8698,0.0235,2.6927,0.9851,0.6269,1.1037,1.0308,1.6006,0.134,2.5612,3.4252,0.9989,5.4091,4.6365,4.8896,4.384,1.7946,1.7068,5.2073,1.6373,0.0747,3.5665,5.6585,2.0149,0.0041,0.9828,0.0614,1.7524,3.5885,3.2841,2.0872,1.3031,0.0003,5.0628,1.8648,5.3803,2.6758,2.1679,5.47,2.3564,5.3643,3.2685,0.9042,5.5665,1.7148,2.464,4.965,2.7372,5.4004,3.004,3.455,0.02,3.4204,3.7767,1.6769,1.964,3.1914,6.2492,5.5337,0.5183,2.2266,5.4297,1.805,5.7208,0.5946,0.061,3.2675,4.1853,0.5785,1.1488,2.7807,1.3287,1.1947,0.0004,5.4962,0.0977,0.925,2.297,4.1181,0.1665,1.369,3.8212,0.06,0.8912,0.4727,3.2588,4.9565,0.1263,4.1366,3.306,0.086,1.6784,1.6999,3.9127,1.0582,0.1045,3.3828,1.7194,3.5851,0.6832,0.6659,1.7057,3.5307,1.0748,3.7947,0.5309,4.4211,0.5351,0.4823,2.9544,5.6551,1.5442,1.0321,3.978,3.0088,0.6394,0.579,0.0004,4.7945,4.55,0.511,0.3088,0.0495,0.5055,0.4093,3.0126,4.1024,2.2077,0.5934,6.2706,6.0934,8.8833,4.6664,0.5014,2.4825,1.1148,4.674,6.211,3.9316,1.3821,1.3282,1.3025,4.8238,0.7909,0.5384,0.3102,3.458,6.2992,1.4734,3.4242,5.1609,2.9305,1.7126,4.9915,2.7797,3.0131,1.8254,1.7295,6.1986,0.8601,2.4733,1.2952,0.3541,4.9566,5.5427,0.7228,5.1204,0.0204,3.4383,2.0447,3.0189,0.0377,1.4537,6.7273,0.0122,1.4299,0.2498,4.4157,0.0673,3.1225,3.593,1.0394,0.3289,2.5083,4.0742,4.177,6.3432,0.0616,0.2947,2.1849,0.1175,2.4608,0.1045,1.496,6.084,4.013,6.3597,0.1072,4.7986,3.2669,1.279,4.4894,3.272,5.6035,1.6006,3.2734,1.1617,1.2765,1.1931,0.9521,0.9455,0.2222,0.2972,0.0003,5.0833,1.7513,0.7548,4.5445,5.8929,0.0603,5.3614,5.9697,6.7014,1.6918,4.9062,1.5479,4.6431,4.3816,0.188,5.773,4.7645,3.1349,2.7336,1.0808,0.6059,0.8845,1.4856,0.0003,6.2177,8.4134,2.7523,0.1791,1.3395,3.3046,0.9328,6.5506,2.8784,3.9273,0.3923,2.2111,0.6986,3.5199,3.9439,4.3603,1.1526,1.3852,2.2458,0.3682,0.4611,0.1133,1.1008,3.2526,2.6716,0.0624,0.4058,2.1731,2.7609,1.5563,8.2379,4.4416,6.4339,0.5054,2.2056,0.0807,2.8689,4.3166,5.2581,0.1558,0.4232,2.8543,0.201,2.4168,1.1634,0.2232,0.4963]}

{"id":4201,"ended":false,"length":327,"text":"Martinsburg, West Virginia, businessman C. Leslie Golliday filed the initial application for the station with the FCC on September 1, 1954. In the application, Golliday estimated construction costs at $50,000,000, and stated it was not possible to achieve the cost \"without special facilities and equipment.\" It was found that a complete electrical substation in West Virginia, with eight copper towers and one underground transmission line, was needed for an annual total of $2,500,000. The proposed station cost $2,500,000, and the utility estimated operating costs as $1,500,300 and $20,300,000 respectively. In December, 1955, the station commission voted to increase the overall station cost to $1,500,000 and to replace the substation with a new copper line to West Virginia. The town of Martinsburg was to be a center of the town's business development during the next 30 years, as more than $80,000 in state money would be provided for the town's commercial and industrial sectors.

{"id":501,"ended":false,"length":336,"text":"Following years of preparation, Jackson's debut album Centipede was distributed in October 1984 by CBS Records, who had signed her as a solo artist two years previously. The album was only available on vinyl on the CD\/DVD compilation.\n\nThe album was produced and arranged by the renowned hip-hop producer, Frank Miller, and was issued in two CDs, the first one an eight-track single featuring a song-by-song comparison of the singer's musical talents to the studio studio record for \"Passion\", and the other two a compilation of 20 tracks featuring different artists, inspired by and written by Jackson.\n\nBackground\n\nIn October 1984, producer J.E.B. (George Lucas) released the follow up to Centipede and was inspired by the success of his film Alien. After several successful releases, he decided to take over as a solo artist. Centipede led to a much more successful solo chart-topper with its worldwide hit single \"The Legend of K.O.I \", where Jackson was recognized as one of the most influential music writers of his era. Centipede performed in a performance where the producer talked about how his project was created. Then, the singer became a regular on radio, singing her songs without ever hearing the words. After this, Jackson worked on his next single \"We're Here\", which was released in March 1982.\n\nThe album Centipede topped the charts in all nations except Canada (by a considerable considerable margin) after a few weeks. Since then, the song has only been added to the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nCoaching\nSince that time, both Jackson and a few other artists have helped the singer on her solo projects. The most notable of these is Frank Miller, who is credited with co-creating the music and recording him.\n\nDiscography\n\nSingles\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Centipede on Billboard.com","token_len":395,"entropy":[6.6744,0.2906,6.8377,0.7242,8.1123,2.3828,7.2143,0.7782,9.6583,1.4602,0.0335,1.7745,8.3792,1.7182,4.2145,5.4362,1.7225,6.5161,0.9226,1.7332,4.3949,2.1647,3.6471,4.3622,3.4795,0.7744,2.7015,0.2175,6.5132,0.6495,4.0348,0.2722,1.7928,1.0336,1.4092,5.7351,2.5966,1.4422,3.8116,3.3746,2.2197,3.1731,3.2656,0.6619,5.2405,2.2168,1.1329,0.0013,2.5976,1.3468,1.2842,4.174,2.4733,5.5325,0.0581,3.4964,5.0138,6.8291,0.5058,0.0005,1.0406,2.7384,4.4677,4.6363,1.0102,1.7642,2.4837,5.1152,1.5512,3.4898,7.0702,1.7006,2.3236,0.6143,3.1276,6.0948,3.2723,0.1064,1.0404,2.5287,3.942,2.9448,3.9767,5.2772,0.3745,0.001,0.0064,5.1539,0.7234,1.5053,5.294,0.712,5.6828,3.8961,1.9207,1.5938,5.5878,5.2391,4.994,4.3801,2.524,4.5382,4.3309,3.4607,1.4853,0.111,2.0448,2.0159,2.1352,3.9241,0.7692,5.2577,1.7488,2.8896,5.634,3.0411,2.6314,7.0401,0.0851,6.3367,4.1053,0.4759,1.0909,0.6275,1.0547,0.0002,8.5739,0.907,0.0001,2.3277,4.4715,0.4218,0.1303,6.5806,5.6493,0.7421,4.3764,0.0068,3.3886,0.0396,5.2611,6.3848,3.1957,0.5687,4.2569,1.4682,5.6146,1.9323,0.2467,2.488,0.0011,0.0001,3.4709,2.8755,4.3689,0.4933,1.1775,2.3112,0.1105,1.6333,4.7396,6.7764,1.5907,3.8076,3.909,3.9865,3.5324,0.6977,3.2099,2.7702,0.1047,2.9468,3.5994,2.4868,2.477,1.1296,0.0785,1.6532,6.8787,0.0012,0.0017,6.4052,3.5379,1.5988,5.5245,1.8499,2.019,3.0641,7.6534,3.5597,0.1401,1.4019,2.6877,4.5404,6.9035,2.5591,2.3423,0.6291,3.427,5.3404,0.5655,4.1347,2.0807,2.4744,0.9762,4.1719,7.7482,4.4928,2.3092,2.9981,5.0249,0.6444,0.9696,0.0067,0.1979,1.7916,0.9304,3.9596,3.956,0.5454,1.5068,2.644,0.2969,4.1463,0.0006,0.0021,5.612,2.589,2.4515,6.7866,5.3337,2.513,5.322,5.5583,0.1631,2.2968,2.3941,5.7128,1.5248,5.1076,1.8269,6.6782,1.053,2.7639,3.9381,4.4193,1.5686,2.9513,1.3749,3.7435,2.5513,4.6651,4.895,3.1732,4.4542,4.0971,6.0648,1.3139,3.5128,0.7957,3.9487,3.2682,0.6197,0.6944,5.2334,1.6266,1.9977,3.0992,3.5048,2.0009,5.3214,2.5218,4.8844,1.9313,1.1594,1.1719,1.477,0.9224,3.7357,6.9486,0.5253,0.9576,0.0001,2.6881,1.8106,5.1269,0.0005,0.0006,5.4875,0.3482,1.7883,1.6665,3.8934,6.6006,3.81,2.8353,3.5401,5.034,2.4302,4.1812,11.727,0.023,1.27,5.2133,2.5473,3.1477,1.3205,1.7045,5.4253,0.8602,0.1611,1.7801,2.4504,0.7036,4.1708,0.7265,6.8757,0.1945,0.5845,2.9688,2.0483,0.0289,2.2132,1.1015,0.0001,5.531,5.5537,0.923,21.2868,4.6792,0.5649,0.0976,6.0478,0.9084,0.0661,6.0431,1.6841,0.8166,1.6007,0.2051,4.8258,3.3813,1.8193,5.0659,2.1332,2.2599,2.681,0.5446,2.6016,3.3651,1.1531,1.1827,0.6648,1.4953,5.2048,0.5014,0.9009,0.3917,3.4051,1.5096,0.4728,3.9035,0.2557,2.9519,0.0011,0.7256,3.2053,3.6309,3.8259,7.836,1.5029,2.1216,0.0001,7.8541,0.0074,0.15,0.0001,6.6597,0.1864,0.3792,0.0001,5.9375,0.8185,0.0003,6.1142,0.6609,0.8946,24.1725,0.0014,0.003,3.7616,3.8541,1.4713,0.1657]}
{"id":4572,"ended":false,"length":348,"text":"As the weather warmed and work resumed on the main pipeline, Alyeska administrators were distracted by a controversy about pipeline welds that had been done the previous year. In September 1975, a new oil pipe on the main pipeline from the southern town of Yekaterinburg to the northern town of Sofala, Russia, was constructed. This section of pipeline had been welded in an identical manner to the four-inch-diameter pipe on the north side of the main pipeline. The proposed pipeline for shipping through Sofala, which had been abandoned and blocked by steel, was one of the few projects by the new government to have significant financial guarantees. On October 3, 1975, the government approved the extension of the pipeline to serve the eastern Siberian town of Sofala because the pipeline needed longer and to be fitted to the new vessel for its capacity in the Arctic and its cargo load capacity.\n\nIn the following October 1995, the government approved a plan to use the proposed oil pipeline as a temporary and temporary fuel storage pipeline that would replace a large natural gas pipeline due to its increased use during the 1990s and 2000s. The plan was to fill the main pipeline with coal and eventually oil for use during and after the end of the long winter winter, but in February 1999, Russia signed a contract with the U.S. government for the construction of a $15.5 million oil pipeline linking the eastern half of the U.S. to Alaska. During that initial stage of the pipeline's construction, approximately one of the 15,000 barrels of oil needed for the first half of the project was filled.\n\nAwards and recognition\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior honored the completion of these two projects with the following award:\n\n National Geographic (1946) Award\n American Geophysical Union (1943) Award\n World War II Memorial Day (1949) Award\n Association of European Countries (1945) Award\n\nReferences","token_len":396,"entropy":[2.9307,6.8975,5.0664,2.2192,10.315,5.7821,2.2143,0.7365,4.6853,6.2667,0.5394,10.8194,4.265,1.7935,12.2708,2.6513,8.6575,0.41,1.6313,8.963,2.547,4.7936,9.3773,0.5068,2.497,1.6674,0.9204,4.8124,6.3186,0.7607,2.4099,0.6975,3.757,3.856,9.9028,0.16,2.4072,4.1966,5.0022,4.8806,4.5359,0.6324,3.7502,1.8082,3.9879,2.3558,5.3377,4.8341,0.0328,5.2871,2.9817,0.0216,0.0046,0.0002,0.7507,1.4842,3.6292,1.5386,0.0329,7.997,8.2734,2.8907,3.8435,0.3591,0.9438,3.0057,1.1471,2.8236,5.7101,0.3181,2.8843,2.6974,0.6058,2.7956,0.0046,2.154,4.3454,6.3094,0.5436,0.5655,0.5114,7.4824,2.0566,2.7161,1.7642,3.9266,0.0049,2.3818,2.5277,0.2399,4.9532,1.4832,0.0681,0.1514,2.2321,0.8506,0.9967,1.3565,6.5521,2.9769,6.173,7.1144,3.6698,3.6254,0.0037,2.1575,1.727,2.3144,0.6563,5.9933,3.9981,6.0703,0.8419,7.4485,2.4024,1.0201,5.3184,0.2205,0.8403,3.0307,2.8457,5.067,0.932,5.7374,2.5158,0.7086,2.634,6.2939,5.8043,8.337,0.914,4.1397,1.8521,3.3313,0.1584,0.9975,0.0617,1.25,2.445,2.4726,0.9373,4.4227,0.1519,0.3116,2.2487,1.3939,6.1275,1.1877,4.7698,3.252,3.6864,0.0227,5.5681,0.0163,7.0685,1.9553,4.3485,5.4437,6.5564,3.0143,6.2339,2.8888,5.7357,2.7912,0.8817,3.2214,5.9965,5.2754,4.034,5.3412,5.1291,1.0465,3.7076,4.3042,4.0305,4.5595,5.4838,5.3241,1.1021,2.3344,0.0024,2.3573,2.2008,2.9855,6.2956,9.9145,0.1525,1.0501,1.5134,1.513,1.6417,3.4568,0.5681,4.4059,0.8565,4.7479,3.8127,0.2926,2.5385,0.5413,3.5644,4.5498,2.4208,4.967,2.9915,4.3736,3.3249,0.3944,4.5266,3.4891,3.513,6.6264,0.0342,1.0375,7.0961,0.2126,2.921,5.0361,2.7147,4.0617,0.5317,4.5534,0.0377,2.0287,2.5678,0.0023,0.3506,1.0917,2.5516,1.4742,1.8885,4.8005,0.8634,3.7676,1.0499,0.9899,4.3582,1.1639,5.3804,5.9709,3.7581,1.8275,3.8702,6.3471,0.2772,0.5352,2.8861,0.005,0.1773,6.6258,1.7898,4.7614,3.1433,2.8156,3.3652,5.3057,3.889,0.5553,4.8033,3.8825,0.8631,2.4355,0.9007,1.2693,2.4744,0.0052,0.0197,0.0865,2.5955,1.7568,1.0994,1.1431,0.0729,0.9712,5.3887,4.1693,1.8387,1.1516,1.2984,3.1772,0.5135,4.0892,1.2799,3.7888,5.8942,0.0268,0.5744,3.8493,0.0028,0.0023,0.1684,1.6516,5.737,0.7519,4.7087,2.6571,5.9838,3.9779,0.4022,1.1948,2.1985,1.3761,0.3221,0.1601,5.7663,4.0039,5.5653,0.4009,6.0005,1.1888,0.2652,2.3393,0.3939,1.0587,3.953,1.0108,0.7168,4.0603,3.1926,0.0998,0.215,1.2834,0.6009,5.5134,1.9133,1.6479,0.0001,3.3955,5.7434,1.4436,4.3862,0.4951,0.0001,1.5501,3.5863,0.0008,0.0045,0.0277,2.5991,0.0016,1.4266,0.0749,4.1726,1.085,5.4648,0.0543,7.2236,2.5609,1.2234,2.9133,1.2392,3.5011,3.232,0.3745,5.0089,19.8187,2.1807,4.4591,3.7473,3.6378,1.0087,3.6497,2.448,21.449,2.9018,0.0162,0.0834,0.2691,0.7462,3.9396,0.0264,0.648,0.4103,18.6118,4.162,0.3685,2.5401,7.5066,1.3798,0.3318,3.1896,0.0229,0.9415,0.513,23.9491,0.4518,5.9677,6.8584,0.5279,3.5934,0.0203,0.4037,0.357,0.0002,7.3656]}
{"id":1732,"ended":true,"length":371,"text":"Liu Kang's famous finishing move of turning into a dragon was ranked by ScrewAttack as the second best in the series, referred to as the most iconic Fatality in Mortal Kombat II, according to the most commonly mis-named Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFMC) title.\n\nLiu Kang has an iconic final move, where he turns into a dragon out of the blue\n\nIn \"A New Way to Die Out\", Liu Kang, born on April 3, 1991, got his start running around with one of the best looking dragons in Mortal Kombat II. He'd also be a master and use it every once in a while for his own purpose. From the moment he got into the air, Liu Kang got used to that look.\n\nWhen it was first revealed in a video last October to Japanese internet users, the idea was to recreate a certain Chinese dragon known as the \"Dragon Rider\", to mimic Liu Kang's transformation into a dragon. Even in the video, which is actually shown to be in the video itself, Liu Kang would still have to fight the dragon.\n\nHe wouldn't have to do that long though. As part of a tournament for his final fight, Liu Kang would face off against his opponent in a battle of legendary proportions: Lian Yang (Tao Tzu-Hai), Liu Kang's former roommate.\n\nLiu Kang would also receive a free kill before the final fight, at which point Liu Kang turned into a giant and finished himself right away after a few hundred seconds of extra time. When he finally beat Liu Kang in the finals, which is usually the most challenging battle that takes place during a tournament, the video was viewed by more than one billion people worldwide.\n\nAt the time of the video's release, there were more than 100 million people watching Liu Kang's final fight, so it was undoubtedly a huge milestone. And it will likely continue to grow as he goes further.","token_len":396,"entropy":[9.8463,6.3412,2.3987,6.6028,10.7079,1.3776,4.2156,4.8778,2.8321,0.4328,5.4536,3.7298,8.8711,3.8959,14.2486,5.4017,1.5579,0.8208,3.5603,1.5319,3.7105,0.5055,3.9967,1.7476,11.2329,0.0248,0.2857,0.984,5.2947,5.866,12.0681,3.8508,1.9942,6.9464,0.0067,0.0,3.3442,2.7494,4.2773,0.0035,1.6292,5.5258,6.2837,7.9358,2.4783,3.8601,6.8808,1.5377,0.079,1.4698,4.7528,10.2296,0.4599,3.7887,1.0482,0.8557,0.0004,4.6543,0.0113,0.2399,4.0656,4.9692,5.2148,3.7831,1.6086,2.1831,4.3599,0.2167,1.7766,0.2755,0.1549,0.4329,8.1087,0.0307,2.8803,2.4188,5.6848,0.0003,2.9753,5.6831,4.3821,3.7018,4.678,1.237,2.8798,9.083,1.4129,1.2957,0.1308,4.1887,7.252,2.8803,3.1048,3.3696,0.2101,3.9685,0.2624,6.6224,1.3923,2.1795,5.5011,4.5059,2.9664,5.5949,0.288,0.6024,3.4438,5.038,3.7983,0.6241,4.174,0.002,0.0,0.6021,1.1841,1.5659,5.4052,3.2708,4.4758,2.812,4.6786,5.6773,7.3389,2.2867,5.0832,5.5474,0.11,0.2294,0.0043,3.4851,1.9144,2.0899,6.2459,0.6217,5.6772,1.9675,2.1299,0.318,3.031,2.94,1.0757,6.9895,0.7306,2.79,0.1008,5.4463,4.0863,0.0343,5.7212,5.4514,1.5422,1.142,0.0001,3.8693,3.9896,1.8195,3.014,2.32,2.1361,3.6438,2.8355,6.5828,4.3189,5.314,8.3085,4.9221,2.0019,0.4965,2.2824,5.4725,1.458,1.1345,4.5621,2.045,5.8825,6.4282,2.5359,3.1816,0.1094,1.438,1.7462,3.5007,5.7135,1.43,4.7552,4.5687,3.1481,0.1127,0.3781,5.5228,0.5326,0.4297,0.5766,0.6153,6.1529,4.023,1.1166,2.8725,0.3723,4.6293,2.7244,4.2852,5.9367,2.7127,1.1057,3.5329,1.4365,3.1862,3.0132,0.1479,1.6875,0.0159,4.8356,2.3264,2.4545,1.6489,2.8536,2.528,2.3298,2.1738,0.8719,0.0001,3.815,5.8767,0.0021,2.1806,0.6814,3.3209,1.7937,5.7631,3.1901,1.5314,3.7664,3.6128,0.002,2.1037,6.1251,3.0583,3.7285,5.6534,2.1069,1.6153,0.856,0.0482,2.2566,3.5622,2.2297,0.1032,3.7442,1.9003,2.0302,0.8524,4.1112,2.0182,6.8964,0.3441,4.4839,5.7492,3.269,5.8865,3.5088,5.1943,3.9573,1.7599,1.8608,5.7475,4.2854,1.9331,1.0886,3.8398,0.6079,0.5606,3.1712,5.8253,1.6934,1.1438,0.0001,1.4593,0.027,0.1298,2.8518,3.9659,6.0265,1.0939,5.9719,4.0327,5.7046,1.2336,2.2882,1.6271,1.4035,5.1282,1.3602,0.2575,2.0776,0.0198,5.1818,0.7079,0.3553,3.1526,4.9166,6.0012,4.5323,7.0007,2.8578,5.808,2.5474,2.1185,4.9285,2.2934,1.1469,6.9771,1.9586,0.3478,5.2079,1.6548,2.9325,4.8461,2.2119,0.0244,1.7008,0.5241,2.205,0.3599,6.3502,3.4779,4.7261,2.1876,2.7123,5.088,3.8038,4.5949,4.5415,0.0446,3.3229,1.495,0.7511,0.4122,2.034,4.5694,1.6921,3.9311,2.3454,2.1326,0.0258,3.7073,2.4005,0.3184,2.0577,0.3513,0.2943,0.0002,5.0739,0.5465,1.005,0.7908,1.4193,0.8916,0.7198,0.3717,0.163,2.9493,0.843,3.7569,0.0363,2.6025,1.5357,1.6637,1.041,4.2797,0.0039,0.9004,1.0596,0.321,1.4941,3.9421,1.2426,1.5514,6.5968,1.4687,1.795,3.8023,1.5833,4.7102,1.9472,5.0041,3.6356,2.8533,0.2093,3.1792,1.7823,2.7273,3.9283,3.3532,2.7289]}

The first recorded production of a set was by T.C. Williams at the Los Angeles Film Company.\n\nIt was in 1990 that, with the end of the \"war\" of the American TV networks, Mantle, who had started writing plays for the network during the 1980s, suddenly quit, and moved to Los Angeles with Mantle. Mantle remained in Los Angeles and, along with his longtime assistant, played Tania, played two more versions of Harry's character. One had Mantle use the term ``red-eye'' because his eye color was as distinctive to Harry as he was to Tania. The other version was ''Harry'' because Harry turned out to be a \"spark\", \"spark-in-a-cart\" person.\n\nIn 1995, in addition to Harry, Tania and Mantle acted as original co-showrunners on the television show `The Big Bang Theory` where the stars appeared in original series of the same name and starred together in the pilot episodes. All the other episodes have been recorded for the series.\n\nA major role, though, has been as Mantle ''In A Room'' with Jim Parsons as [[i]], who played the villainous \"Harry Potter'' in ''The Dark Knight''.
