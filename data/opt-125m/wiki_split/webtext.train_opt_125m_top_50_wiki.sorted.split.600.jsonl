{"id":2802,"ended":false,"length":521,"text":"At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 59, based on 6 reviews, which indicates `` mixed reviews'' from critics.\n\nCritical reception\nIn a review for Metacritic, Alan Bergquist said ``the album is much better than expected, probably in-line with the consensus from critics and the critics'' of The Music Reader. Although \"The Music Reader'' drew a consensus from critics, the album was too much like other mainstream hits, generating very mixed reviews. Bergquist said that the album''s title, along with some of the songs \"Till he Sleeps'' were also mixed into the album''s single \"The Blue Sky'', which gave it a.5 average reviews. In his review to Metacritic, Peter Kallhorn said: ''After a disappointing debut, The Music Reader should deliver a much better album than we'd expected. Even in the midst of a sluggish and very slow start, The Music Reader remains a respectable album, even with its missteps. I highly recommend this album to anyone who wants something a bit more experimental, or who feels passionate about the music themselves and hopes that some of their songs will draw the listener in as well....''\n\nBox office\nA box office analysis by New York-based tracker IHS Markit showed that the album earned $7.9 million for its third week at the domestic box office. It has grossed $12.3 million so far this year, and has earned $10.1 million in US theaters. The album was the second-highest grosser-turned-release of the year by the IHS Markit score. In the United States the album is expected to gross $50.2 million this year, moving into second place at number 1 worldwide. The album was released by the John Legend label on March 31 as the third studio album for the legendary John Legend, and the third best-selling of all time.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, No. 4 on the UK chart and No. 5 in France is the album''s highest grossing single of all time. In the United States it tops the album, at No. 4, to move into the top spot for third place at number three.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\nJohn Legend \u2013 lead vocals on \"The Blue Sky''\nPaul Pogba \u2013 guitar, keyboards, percussion\nMichael Jackson \u2013 pianist\nAlan Bergquist \u2013 vocals on \"Till he Sleeps''\nDave Matthews \u2013 lead vocals on \"The Blue Sky\"\n\nTechnical staff\nJohn Legend \u2013 lead vocals on \"The Blue Sky''\nPaul Pogba \u2013 lead vocals on \"The Blue Sky\"\nMichael Jackson \u2013 piano, strings, percussion, drums, programming\nGeorge Michael \u2013 tumblin guitar, bass guitar, guitar tuning\nJohn Legend \u2013 bass guitar solo\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links","token_len":600,"entropy":[9.7965,2.8341,0.0764,0.9065,3.6245,5.6256,1.0719,12.0961,1.5118,7.8505,0.0864,1.4124,1.741,4.4185,4.7733,7.5167,2.1606,0.426,1.761,4.971,3.8629,2.0416,1.8729,1.2494,0.0438,5.9737,3.3723,5.5763,0.0453,5.6605,1.6596,2.4465,2.5818,5.2741,13.4291,13.0552,1.2348,5.2675,3.5297,2.2385,0.8865,1.3965,0.0009,7.2548,3.4167,2.8523,17.8237,2.636,2.4134,1.2082,3.5141,0.0004,0.0002,0.3316,6.289,6.8777,5.2058,2.5617,4.9877,3.371,1.0957,1.2207,6.6025,0.8068,0.1867,4.0634,1.6592,6.2012,3.9499,7.7263,1.9252,0.0148,1.6211,5.8329,4.1469,1.5655,2.0338,2.9203,4.5198,5.9919,3.2684,5.2054,5.7487,6.7805,0.981,6.2706,4.6268,3.1799,0.5458,0.0091,1.9276,6.4229,1.8881,6.4518,2.5731,1.1133,0.8362,2.0224,0.8936,2.1034,6.8968,3.0303,2.9268,3.1939,6.2845,4.7148,1.5234,8.3421,5.2974,2.8056,0.1324,0.9297,2.7781,0.0007,1.3605,1.2986,1.9271,0.6495,9.426,0.0517,5.1704,2.4219,5.9583,0.0005,3.8856,1.2856,0.5701,2.9893,5.0292,5.9074,4.3697,7.409,3.5918,0.851,3.6843,3.9729,3.8697,1.68,5.3521,0.5722,1.0297,5.1165,0.0099,5.0476,2.4908,3.4468,6.8626,3.2984,8.2111,1.4576,1.6467,5.8022,1.7796,0.7002,9.3406,6.1596,3.8155,6.5217,0.9056,4.1109,3.6325,0.4225,5.7306,1.0434,0.0044,0.0006,0.1609,5.1565,4.4516,6.8372,8.4295,0.9118,2.4946,2.777,5.778,2.2577,5.3242,2.064,0.8812,1.2193,0.0531,0.0036,5.2073,6.3649,1.1172,3.0464,0.7408,0.8593,1.2482,3.5665,4.2569,1.301,1.178,5.2866,3.4501,1.1452,3.3562,0.0007,1.0875,6.242,3.7192,5.9461,4.0971,2.3239,0.2902,0.9121,0.0114,0.0026,4.6073,1.1767,6.0785,1.6629,1.9859,2.8639,2.3259,1.9526,6.3496,0.655,1.3471,3.3107,3.89,0.1475,1.7938,0.3222,0.9097,0.8597,0.9583,1.9203,3.6647,2.8152,1.2504,0.7341,4.0482,1.5029,3.2303,1.7661,3.6923,7.9958,0.0383,1.8822,1.2696,6.7373,3.578,4.9772,1.5945,4.6369,1.0794,2.2583,2.0652,1.2045,5.8323,2.8921,2.3924,1.5131,4.3531,0.2368,7.05,1.9312,0.3861,0.0004,10.357,2.5489,0.9788,9.4556,5.1008,0.0158,4.5792,2.3143,5.898,0.2679,1.7171,0.0085,6.4372,6.2278,1.6473,1.9843,0.0005,2.2897,0.7608,1.1029,0.6316,2.7503,0.8763,4.0153,0.477,2.7525,0.4758,2.5703,2.2019,3.888,1.3887,3.3315,1.5971,4.2629,0.0657,0.0016,1.4587,2.5108,3.4604,2.8215,0.0009,0.2683,4.2541,0.0958,2.5142,0.0897,2.9104,0.0003,0.5606,0.4168,0.8869,2.5813,2.6952,2.4953,0.4373,3.7022,0.1585,2.5514,0.0028,1.5395,8.6404,1.9117,0.8571,1.3961,0.627,2.7902,2.459,1.9464,1.3944,0.7296,0.9072,3.3696,7.5817,8.3267,0.0159,4.6008,1.5393,0.8366,0.4737,3.4193,3.0518,3.7057,0.0135,1.2102,0.0011,5.5234,1.8948,3.7651,1.9005,3.6151,0.0944,4.1125,0.3017,2.1087,3.2487,0.0197,2.003,0.2814,5.4004,0.8519,2.256,0.0097,1.6723,0.7391,0.6884,7.6534,3.3492,2.0811,0.0657,2.117,3.7737,4.3157,4.8266,0.7181,1.8698,0.5458,2.3794,2.5095,2.8997,4.5737,5.8755,5.4041,3.9284,1.932,2.8862,3.5205,6.31,2.0557,3.7192,3.3818,0.1457,3.0837,1.5407,5.3446,3.9197,0.4026,2.4878,2.1736,2.4441,2.9913,4.1378,0.8973,0.0503,4.9759,2.6199,0.1719,0.7712,1.1917,0.0004,3.4153,1.3242,1.5846,2.3091,0.5082,7.0934,0.2693,3.0785,2.2607,0.4645,3.3243,2.2081,4.5253,0.1146,0.0032,2.4184,1.6802,4.1852,3.7628,1.7373,1.5553,9.0524,0.0062,3.1547,0.9925,0.3025,2.7092,2.4289,1.4132,0.0254,0.7306,2.6154,1.044,1.0783,0.0533,2.0883,6.7706,0.6306,3.5358,3.3797,2.3841,1.0025,0.0105,2.4703,1.3017,5.1985,6.1814,0.9988,2.1871,0.5073,2.5525,2.7319,5.2246,1.0062,2.1477,1.524,3.4298,0.8771,1.5943,0.0003,5.2798,2.5391,0.4495,0.0053,9.292,1.4583,1.4375,21.576,0.0116,5.5446,6.2278,1.9605,4.592,0.9797,1.7907,1.2737,0.0074,1.5036,0.6842,22.6233,7.8642,1.2934,0.1347,2.6261,1.798,2.0971,0.7537,2.9619,1.215,20.3585,0.456,0.0721,7.0695,0.2777,1.2797,19.6771,0.7621,0.0062,0.0801,3.4058,2.0261,0.1737,1.5426,0.0048,0.6673,0.0011,0.0005,0.6024,0.2236,17.4913,1.4291,1.3636,3.4689,0.6548,0.1501,0.0725,0.9217,0.3994,0.0013,4.0118,0.132,0.0004,10.0343,4.4612,0.5675,16.7534,0.0273,0.6808,1.1431,0.2887,0.3036,0.1656,0.3304,0.0858,0.0007,0.4056,0.1441,19.1098,0.1522,0.0037,0.0309,1.3428,0.0178,0.0141,0.0154,0.3986,0.0084,0.0007,1.0385,0.0839,19.6601,0.0043,0.0065,2.0754,0.7492,5.1411,0.6456,0.7029,3.6875,2.6137,1.5825,9.7818,0.7284,24.2687,2.1852,0.0751,7.3887,8.4713,6.5305,3.9388,0.5764,2.386,3.7897,0.3629,3.7455,5.3423,0.8291,22.7368,0.129,0.1533,2.4421,0.7111,7.5094,2.226,0.0002,9.4923,0.7724,0.0005,7.0722,0.4364]}
{"id":629,"ended":true,"length":537,"text":"The Miami Hurricanes entered the Peach Bowl with a record @ - @ breaking offense that set the school mark for the most accumulated yards in school history with a total offensive mark of 3,024 \u2013 the best by an individual team. The most complete offense in college football history, the #MHSAA will honor Miami with two #3 ranked offenses in the nation. #MiamiHur Hurricanes vs. #Florida Panthers (3-0 @ @MiamiHawks). pic.twitter.com\/N6qPcDUq2k \u2014 USC Football (@ USCFootball) February 29, 2021\nThe Hurricanes are led by sophomore wide receiver Isaiah Ridley, who completed 48.5% of his passes for 242 yards and two touchdowns, while returning 13 returning injured starters and running back Leighton Vander Esch. With four combined touchdowns for the Hurricanes in his back half, Ridley is off to the fast start of a career season.\nAccording to BLS, the team broke the school record for the most completed balls in a game, while rushing defense was ranked fifth in college football with a total offensive mark of 29.5% of the time.\nIn fact, it had been only seven years since Miami and Florida State held the distinction and it\u2019s still quite a feat to accomplish that. The Hurricanes have only completed one touchdown in eight games as well, but they\u2019ve completed 12 percent of their passes for a total of 3,025 yards, which is more than any other team in the nation.\nThe team set a school record for most completed passes of the year in 2020 as well, with a total of 2,035 yards. Those totals are a game record by the Hurricanes. The team went 1-14 without a touchdown in a victory over the Florida Gators.\nThe school record for most completed passes of first-round picks is passed by the Miami FSU team at #18. If the season had ended on a night when Florida State, USC, Georgia, & Georgia Tech had come down to the wire, it would still have been a win.\nTo be honest, the Miami Hurricanes were never even close to putting up a football standard in the Peach Bowl. They still couldn\u2019t find an interception during the entire first half, while the Gators were outshooting the Hurricanes 19-3 and losing by a score of 33-3.\nSo what did the # Hurricanes do differently after all that was accomplished in a short period of time? The difference made by the game was that the victory came courtesy of Miami\u2019s defense in a way that Florida State didn\u2019t. As a result, the Gators trailed 32-16 at halftime and held Miami scoreless the rest of the way.\nIf the Miami Hurricanes had ended the competition game against Georgia Tech with another lead, it would still have marked a victory for the defending national champions. But the team was unable to capitalize on the opportunity the day after finishing the season 0-12.","token_len":601,"entropy":[10.0054,3.9108,5.8535,0.6638,11.4028,0.0754,1.4807,0.8071,3.0398,14.7079,8.3025,9.9463,13.5203,11.394,3.2962,6.165,1.2335,2.2725,6.3564,0.868,1.89,1.3393,10.2536,2.3857,1.3602,3.8676,0.0165,3.9408,3.9929,2.461,6.3182,7.0341,0.0892,3.9237,0.0783,6.4995,6.5478,1.9886,3.3259,2.8367,1.704,5.267,2.4308,2.1534,1.6312,5.8242,6.5938,2.9846,0.6718,2.9346,0.3249,1.0172,2.2675,1.344,5.6796,7.9643,7.2433,4.7743,5.1145,5.8795,2.507,2.8237,4.3456,6.2143,4.6037,4.4262,5.4911,1.6809,0.8585,1.5077,1.1686,3.7502,1.239,3.5548,23.3758,5.8733,1.1928,0.8619,3.3487,3.626,3.2532,4.313,1.3294,1.3439,4.3955,4.1647,5.0212,3.9192,1.2637,3.8608,2.1218,0.0007,0.0002,0.0004,0.0002,0.0004,4.4638,3.7544,4.0909,4.435,4.5026,4.104,4.6106,3.4666,4.4339,4.2659,0.0483,8.7534,0.7401,0.055,6.6623,0.1592,0.0796,2.6752,3.823,0.0001,13.2653,0.1251,11.4539,1.4288,2.5085,4.944,0.0219,4.2535,3.3819,0.2867,5.7713,8.6669,0.9834,0.2665,4.5333,5.1966,1.286,1.7059,1.6274,0.029,0.0247,0.0818,0.4943,7.0292,0.0162,0.5108,1.126,0.1927,2.456,1.2583,4.1279,5.4017,8.1977,11.2171,1.6884,2.7983,4.2165,0.2199,4.6159,6.4009,4.8074,7.2309,0.4374,0.7468,4.7568,3.8659,5.9733,1.6108,3.8695,0.9684,0.4851,3.3886,3.2997,8.757,4.6473,0.4156,0.4785,1.8783,7.2414,0.0769,2.9475,7.6599,0.2611,1.4106,3.9028,2.9105,4.8235,1.1508,1.3768,5.6646,0.0028,6.6661,5.7362,0.9556,1.9964,4.3707,6.9366,1.1119,1.0844,0.3629,0.4124,1.6277,0.2458,4.84,7.5944,0.9066,0.3558,0.7526,2.7117,4.4093,4.7261,6.58,1.7909,2.9178,4.0827,1.244,5.8259,0.1397,1.5781,1.6353,1.4048,4.123,2.4012,0.0353,5.7462,1.577,1.7916,6.9697,3.2279,1.3152,1.5075,0.2462,1.3566,3.663,4.6116,0.0197,4.1141,5.3378,0.8163,5.5675,4.5067,1.1569,0.6009,2.9086,5.2215,1.65,2.532,5.2846,1.6212,5.3917,3.9216,3.3113,18.3168,6.7164,1.7768,3.7541,5.3167,1.0433,4.4009,1.4501,3.805,2.5866,1.1962,1.9318,0.9221,2.1094,3.754,4.9111,4.0744,3.3478,2.5343,4.0908,0.3492,4.5236,2.8366,1.0902,2.1597,2.1641,7.0865,1.254,0.588,3.0565,4.1664,6.7385,0.2785,0.0861,0.9443,2.1899,3.2255,0.8156,0.9246,3.9038,0.0341,5.2158,0.0605,2.0608,3.0509,0.9815,3.4686,0.1054,1.0828,0.3896,0.3958,0.5973,0.4528,0.9606,0.2784,0.8187,1.7037,3.5135,6.061,0.9763,1.27,0.2816,0.5608,2.3309,2.9142,0.7107,5.1306,3.0265,2.2074,1.7002,8.1204,4.2621,1.4913,0.7881,1.8728,2.0528,0.3328,1.3744,2.7568,0.0028,6.5452,1.4916,1.6837,6.0981,2.9644,1.7512,3.3262,6.1015,4.4832,3.5675,2.8022,2.1964,1.6039,2.0969,1.657,4.7083,3.4974,0.0795,4.1347,5.3343,1.4342,1.7123,1.5506,3.7476,6.2084,0.3688,1.7804,2.7739,0.5247,1.3516,0.627,1.3952,5.3321,2.321,0.987,0.9685,1.4153,0.3394,1.9752,10.1432,2.3234,4.2235,2.22,1.3316,5.73,0.2718,1.8435,1.685,8.3186,2.6296,3.7642,3.7918,1.0532,4.1691,2.7902,6.354,1.5304,5.6201,4.6477,1.4403,2.01,2.084,5.6176,1.3907,3.8665,0.7546,4.4346,3.8868,0.7423,4.6891,0.9215,7.3306,3.5052,2.0221,2.7225,7.0978,4.8156,1.0132,2.258,1.5637,0.869,2.5473,0.263,4.7554,1.7324,0.5225,1.9414,4.2433,1.5995,1.3896,5.3767,2.7516,3.1377,0.1191,1.8978,2.6481,0.3857,2.457,4.3944,5.5283,0.2987,0.1487,4.8456,0.953,0.9842,5.9953,7.6495,2.8003,1.2668,2.9149,0.0104,0.5252,2.503,5.4673,5.2286,0.7424,2.3379,0.0016,4.7152,3.2523,6.3553,4.3554,0.6984,3.4539,4.3887,0.1619,1.5642,4.3214,1.5817,2.4352,1.9422,3.6251,3.947,1.0499,1.0598,0.6606,5.196,0.1014,2.5553,3.4126,4.6119,2.0993,1.8899,2.2037,0.0441,5.0036,0.2465,2.9673,0.2723,0.9906,4.4229,1.9836,2.4803,0.8201,4.5513,9.3676,0.3816,4.7687,4.5938,5.0607,1.5203,4.3026,2.6756,2.4374,2.5155,3.994,1.8526,0.0889,0.0103,0.1784,3.2285,7.2704,6.3691,2.6632,0.7792,5.5919,1.643,1.1308,0.8843,6.7259,2.7322,4.1549,0.0082,3.7072,7.2444,0.5492,0.1044,2.9569,4.8168,2.5272,3.8792,0.2873,4.8754,0.3892,2.5899,0.5407,0.2605,0.0778,0.9297,4.7597,1.5904,0.4188,0.1779,0.7169,3.3008,6.6959,6.0269,0.0127,3.6281,2.122,0.7014,1.5626,4.587,2.0433,4.2182,0.0032,4.971,0.3996,0.0015,0.0072,0.4684,0.815,0.6957,4.8489,1.3831,2.7226,0.2494,1.8843,5.3333,1.2834,7.3187,8.4406,4.8969,3.6228,0.6656,2.7544,5.5614,5.5589,1.1024,1.748,0.2487,3.8426,0.6827,7.1344,2.1791,2.9248,0.3043,0.6884,5.8048,0.7288,0.5938,0.4187,2.8471,1.9466,3.0757,2.5808,3.7149,0.0037,3.0395,0.3079,1.4026,3.2982,5.6166,4.7903,2.5392,7.3247,1.7371,1.0444,4.0722,0.0094,2.765,1.1354]}

Bolton Wanderers full @ - @ back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about the final match of the season.\n\nInjury has damaged three of Di Jones' six players at the Etihad Stadium while a second player was also kept on the sidelines.\n\nMeredith \"s performances for Northwich gained the attention of several other clubs in the Football League.\n\nBolton will travel to West Yorkshire next Saturday to face Sunderland at Meeley Town and will be hoping to bounce back after poor play on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, manager Davey Jones also said that the defender is expected to play tonight after he tested positive last weekend for a suspected substance in his hotel.\n\nBolton have won just one of their six games under Jones \u2014 the club's last nine were a winless run.\n\nHe also said that Jones underwent a scan on Saturday morning and that he will be in attendance for the match.\n\nJones' side lost 3-0 at Reading and went into extra time with a seven-point cushion at the top of the points table, three points adrift of the relegation zone.\n\n\"As a manager, you know exactly what you are trying to get, but you don't always have a clear idea of how you are going,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\"For me, you can't know as far as what's right and what's not right. I just try to make sure that I am focussed and as hard working as I can.\n\n\"Being honest with myself, a game like the game between the two sides is a test of character and the way I can play throughout the season.\n\n\"Having said that, it is too soon to say if anything can come from this, and it certainly is not.\n\n\"It can't be expected to be right but there is a level of focus from the players that is really needed to try to improve. I won't dwell too much on that.\n\n\"The manager has said that if he has no football problems he will go to West Yorkshire for the game because he knows where it is to play, and it was for that reason that he chose it.\"\n\nJones and his players hope to get an immediate win when they take on Sunderland this weekend, after a season-long absence due to COVID restrictions.\n\nA statement from the London stadium said: \"A medical sample and a report of the suspected substance were taken at the start of last night.\n\n\"The club are now investigating the circumstances and have asked the relevant

Bertin's fingers were described in the documentary as \"totally erotic\". They were described as \"heavily erotic, seductive, and utterly arousing\". Many of these characters wore hand-made, silk-colored suits and \"gloved fingers\"; they were wearing gloves and were holding hands; Bertin's lips were \"warm and delicate\", and he \"began to feel very special\".

Bertin's most successful documentaries \"The Man Who Broke the Bond\" and \"The Secret Life Of Love\" aired in 1973 and are screened weekly both on British television and on BBC2.

{"id":778,"ended":true,"length":553,"text":"The Parents Television Council ( PTC ) criticized Rihanna for her portrayal of `` cold, calculated execution of murder `` in the music video, and argued that murdering a rapist as socially @anti_cop is the victim of a criminal justice system in a much worse way.\n\nIn a letter to the PTC Chairman, CTC wrote that ''the rape, killing, torture and murder of innocent citizens of a democratic country is an appalling and senseless crime'' and demanded that Rihanna be allowed to leave the country and refrain from entering the U.N.'s peacekeeping mission and refrain from participating in the annual UNSC forum on security in Sierra Leone.\n\n''At her house, [she said], `I want to sleep in your bed, in her own bed, in your own bed, as your only friend.` I ask you, `Are you a friend to me? Do you treat me with respect? Is that the way you handle me? If you are the person who killed my mother in 1994 or the mother who murdered my father, let me go to the home of my mother and tell you what I did in my bedroom where you lived, and then I will have you killed and I will give you justice and I will tell you that it was consensual.`\n\n''How is this the justice that you wish to have in Sierra Leone? A rapist is responsible for murder and every person who dies or suffers the consequences of his actions is a rapist. To rape, murder or to kill your rapist who has already decided to commit suicide, you must go home and do away with your own body.''\n\nThe PTC issued a similar letter to the Executive Chairman, the UN Secretariat and the president of the United Nations, UN Chief Ban Ki-moon.\n\nThe PTC said that it was too soon to say if the decision to boycott Rihanna's upcoming track is a sign of the U.S. government's ongoing support for 'Jingle Bells' of the song, which is sung by Rihanna, which is a popular hit in the United States.\n\nThe PTC also suggested that Rihanna should be allowed to wear \"Black Eyed Peas\" as a song at the UN.\n\nCTC urged the Executive Chairman to take heed of the fact that her words would be heard as a part of an American policy of silence about the recent attacks against police in the United States.\n\nCTC also pointed out that the threat of violence and the lack of transparency of incidents is especially disturbing, especially since in a country that supports democracy, the use of violence as a weapon should be taken very seriously.\n\nThe PTC also called for the use of force against those who use the weapon of choice, especially against those who use the weapon of political authority, such as those politicians who hold sway over the public's perception of the country as an individual or as one place that they should not engage in acts of violence.","token_len":603,"entropy":[11.6818,7.0097,1.1115,1.7168,5.4423,0.181,0.3251,7.1658,12.4504,0.0446,1.211,1.9525,5.7956,0.1691,12.8809,13.9229,1.8936,4.8767,8.5834,2.4751,6.797,4.7932,1.2615,1.5615,4.6607,0.076,2.6561,2.823,5.0293,0.2223,11.3274,1.552,6.156,5.2764,9.8926,15.5624,8.4363,3.1757,6.2671,1.7712,3.9096,7.1037,0.9924,1.6091,4.0882,1.6744,0.0952,3.9126,3.7359,6.0636,1.3719,1.0849,1.4895,1.7028,0.0297,2.9912,1.3379,2.9671,0.4933,1.3885,3.0643,0.0116,6.1407,0.9122,5.4494,5.8605,6.3322,1.0419,3.3609,2.4831,5.3806,3.9841,3.4605,0.9081,3.2146,0.7708,2.1245,0.2307,3.7283,4.4061,2.3832,3.3047,5.2929,1.7306,1.0339,2.6692,3.3624,2.1946,4.6041,0.7617,4.1553,0.4909,3.8752,0.9232,1.2192,0.0043,1.7647,4.9706,0.1058,3.8674,0.4593,0.9654,2.6488,6.3557,0.0035,6.1978,0.8025,2.6825,0.0007,4.2449,3.0366,0.0473,3.078,0.3597,0.4588,4.197,6.8323,0.0098,3.377,0.0204,1.663,6.3519,3.1905,5.0767,7.8222,1.1981,6.3145,2.3056,7.7653,0.0002,0.3958,0.3522,0.0006,2.7215,5.4875,5.2689,7.1068,1.3167,6.2357,3.2188,5.4157,2.2866,2.1005,1.0953,2.421,0.2788,5.2923,1.6946,2.221,0.8727,1.763,4.5415,5.4432,5.2739,0.6365,0.8395,1.4845,0.8073,0.9374,0.8287,1.0737,4.6556,4.3399,4.5765,3.7566,1.995,4.9418,3.9313,4.8724,0.8369,1.6795,1.1696,3.246,0.0603,3.2981,2.5996,2.7496,0.6877,1.4118,2.8098,0.0988,6.9312,0.1831,2.4681,0.8093,1.3976,3.3323,1.6594,2.9968,0.9675,0.4887,7.4375,1.8766,1.1171,4.0166,0.8572,2.5682,4.0579,2.5807,1.0824,3.1844,1.196,2.1483,3.9567,4.0021,4.1921,3.3329,5.5044,0.8081,1.6415,0.4057,1.0691,1.8002,6.2085,0.4246,3.6131,2.0802,1.4895,5.7222,0.7119,1.3058,1.9292,1.1644,1.8123,1.2092,1.6197,0.893,2.5727,3.5934,2.9287,5.3118,5.1534,1.809,5.3642,1.8847,2.0585,3.7219,1.8888,0.7149,3.8999,2.7921,2.206,2.7998,2.2789,0.1471,4.4215,0.0998,6.4053,2.7053,1.5366,0.1163,3.2487,0.0731,2.3915,3.4765,1.3911,5.4603,2.1377,2.5884,1.9815,0.0003,2.4685,5.185,3.422,1.9518,3.5526,6.0366,1.6838,0.8643,4.6347,1.0065,2.7327,3.3525,5.172,0.0011,0.7089,5.6789,3.7857,1.9672,4.7896,0.1364,3.6161,2.1358,5.7402,3.0015,0.6416,5.742,4.6309,4.4681,3.8257,1.5606,0.3149,2.1595,1.7788,1.0357,1.2737,1.5969,0.8665,4.8331,3.1325,3.11,2.2463,2.7324,2.8952,1.9397,4.3782,4.6411,5.6059,2.357,4.0241,6.5781,0.496,1.8407,2.4971,1.9055,2.1241,2.1339,4.1299,5.846,0.941,3.2583,6.3481,0.0244,1.2613,3.381,3.6915,2.5913,0.1478,0.0004,1.6606,1.7582,0.0057,4.788,0.3692,4.0692,0.8153,0.649,1.1954,7.8957,5.0572,1.7228,3.8911,3.6391,6.1562,0.0034,1.6501,0.5834,5.8756,0.3046,0.2476,1.8254,0.0272,2.222,6.889,6.4231,2.0139,0.001,0.0416,0.0387,1.0113,0.5639,0.0004,1.4658,1.7706,0.0046,2.7815,0.8433,2.5401,1.8257,6.1692,2.1799,0.0935,1.895,2.3018,1.9296,4.6043,0.7468,4.9413,0.4139,0.0036,0.6348,2.6888,7.9952,4.0226,2.0188,3.763,0.7263,1.9044,3.697,0.0018,1.7788,0.648,1.758,0.1187,6.1831,2.7219,0.3244,6.7006,6.2179,5.7778,0.0592,0.0824,1.1191,6.4623,1.4015,5.7653,1.7407,0.9948,1.7631,5.8086,0.3655,3.2075,0.0111,2.6654,3.2367,1.5912,2.7523,3.1185,3.5934,1.3072,1.0059,1.9833,0.0286,0.3966,0.3676,0.0005,1.5662,1.6862,0.0035,1.627,5.456,0.1675,1.1664,0.0049,1.621,1.2662,0.967,0.0947,6.2798,5.6293,4.6259,3.7473,0.0,0.0057,0.0007,0.6934,3.2344,0.9531,5.905,3.5614,0.9185,1.259,2.3169,0.5256,0.0004,12.4814,0.2346,4.9644,0.4961,5.8746,0.765,0.6578,3.5511,5.4275,0.4611,0.5351,3.7567,0.0198,5.4623,6.2527,4.7809,1.6081,3.302,4.122,1.1791,5.6301,0.0056,3.1,4.41,3.978,1.3107,3.5517,4.0175,1.3062,5.1044,2.8822,2.7137,4.3241,1.1621,2.061,1.5264,0.0168,0.6222,0.4242,0.0003,4.9548,0.0127,1.8654,3.6748,0.1497,0.0931,1.1997,7.1346,0.6509,1.7737,2.855,2.8385,4.1395,0.0027,4.3281,2.9481,7.516,3.3277,5.2733,3.1459,2.58,2.2944,2.9953,4.9889,3.4876,1.2633,2.3473,5.4667,3.9063,0.657,1.6943,3.9284,0.0097,0.7625,3.57,0.3564,2.1412,5.0305,0.7112,3.7244,2.6104,0.0046,0.3038,0.408,0.0003,1.5701,1.4069,0.0073,1.4861,2.4979,0.8873,1.1589,4.8518,0.0039,2.5538,0.8525,2.5728,0.8487,4.0485,2.4689,5.046,2.2529,1.1516,1.3763,3.306,3.0984,1.9947,0.5053,2.456,1.4631,0.89,0.2252,8.1022,5.4656,1.5333,2.0491,0.004,2.9104,7.2337,1.1966,4.3377,4.0861,0.8999,0.7217,3.6809,3.995,2.7098,0.119,1.0432,2.5194,4.1555,2.7181,7.8274,2.2261,1.9903,5.6567,6.5448,3.9079,3.275,3.0678,2.036,5.5733,0.2412,5.1614,0.1437,0.4155,0.4707]}
{"id":1682,"ended":true,"length":567,"text":"Much critical attention has been paid to the film's focus on sexuality and gender identity. < unk > < unk > has noted that the opening scene of Ghost in the Shell begins with the main character, Kazuki, confronting female protagonists in a dark room -- \"We all know what happens when we have sex while a woman is asleep,\" he writes. (The film is an adaptation of the novel by Yumi Seki.)\n\nOne of the film's main character, the protagonist Suzuka, who wears a black wig, takes on this role. It's the kind of role that could never be described in terms of just one simple word -- and only two.\n\nFor Suzuka, sexual relationships with girls were the core of sex, and her relationship was a constant topic as she grew older. To have an actual sex scene in front of others, her own body, the character she was a part of, was \"the first time she had even experienced it in person,\" the movie notes. \"You can't have a sex scene in front of all these girls. They must all be talking to each other, with voices and all the things, or just having sex.\"\n\nAs she approaches adulthood, Suzuka and her friend, Nakaji, develop a romantic bond that extends farther than the movie, allowing them to pursue what many in the film describe as \"love, sex, and friendship.\"\n\n\"Kazuki starts to feel confident in those things that she's going to want to have with someone when she wants to, but also realizes that the other woman would prefer that things to continue,\" the movie notes that leads the heroine to believe a deeper connection.\n\nKazuki and Nakaji share a passion for the music and the dance game in the film, while also acknowledging that they also find it hard to express their own sexuality when their bodies are together.\n\nMeanwhile, as the film starts to explore the sexuality and gender identity of the characters, they also discover that the movie explores the \"willingness to have a sexual relationship\" that they share.\n\n\"We're all so sexually liberated -- sex and intimacy -- in the movie. We're all trying to love one another at the same time,\" Suzuka says through her small eyes. \"But we all have our own sexuality, and we all have things we just don't want. This movie shows us that.\"\n\nA sex scene in a movie that could only be described as an adaptation of an award-winning story of American womanhood may not have made the best overall film of all time. But it is fitting that the movie is getting attention for how it compares to several other films which include the popular 'Seinen Nights' remake and the recently released 'Himself...'.\n\n*Note: This review isn't necessarily a recommendation of the movie by a critic.\n\n(Note: This review isn't necessarily a recommendation of the movie by a critic.","token_len":603,"entropy":[9.3975,6.6956,0.8404,0.1848,0.2413,0.062,0.9205,7.8219,0.3926,6.25,0.0694,6.6176,1.3574,1.9518,2.0178,1.2488,11.7048,11.466,5.7373,5.5162,4.0696,3.4526,0.0497,0.3339,7.0715,8.1172,0.6511,1.6031,6.3769,1.841,1.5485,8.3035,0.8639,0.0448,0.009,6.7471,0.4698,1.5541,4.9215,0.5585,2.4579,4.5733,2.042,1.1402,6.2761,6.6172,5.4072,2.432,1.2681,5.5963,1.9433,7.4138,3.8251,4.8308,3.6025,1.2524,2.0512,2.1938,0.495,2.8465,3.5145,1.2737,6.75,4.5292,2.2458,0.4785,3.3999,1.9245,1.7657,2.2574,0.4124,4.4727,2.3055,2.1884,2.8829,4.7548,1.059,0.0773,0.8717,1.766,0.8492,3.7696,4.295,6.4054,1.5082,1.2386,2.6537,0.0006,5.0739,0.8857,0.23,3.4854,0.0043,3.1341,4.4613,0.5,4.2568,2.6519,6.0645,1.4778,0.5035,3.6075,5.1078,0.5386,3.5331,3.8832,1.0292,5.1862,2.2561,4.3363,0.9349,1.8167,3.9329,0.8523,3.4202,3.2077,0.0096,2.162,0.7146,3.6334,5.8604,0.6885,5.1675,1.7279,2.1413,0.0206,6.7644,2.3006,7.5488,4.7848,2.682,3.8736,5.3675,4.2877,1.9179,1.5103,0.0002,4.5223,5.2178,0.0272,0.2145,5.6707,5.2111,2.5507,4.1565,3.007,3.4531,5.5242,0.52,8.0038,1.6153,1.0244,3.0768,3.3785,3.9325,2.9533,4.6435,5.2912,5.8439,0.803,3.0644,0.9376,0.3312,5.1007,4.7256,3.8807,3.9366,2.3161,1.2728,1.8642,5.3771,0.0017,4.8006,1.8521,4.5207,5.1333,1.9786,2.0204,4.0493,3.491,5.1187,1.538,4.6902,0.1016,0.0039,0.3363,1.2725,5.0057,2.4483,3.9166,2.0972,3.4674,1.8858,5.575,3.6921,2.4985,2.2261,2.2123,0.6285,3.997,3.5539,3.0859,0.1254,1.7942,4.4783,2.171,0.9958,2.6176,1.6799,2.2316,0.0171,1.9534,0.831,0.0027,3.5943,2.3416,2.112,1.8833,3.3302,4.6728,3.9485,0.7247,5.062,1.7725,0.3988,0.0096,1.9376,4.6522,5.9177,2.2082,4.1334,2.2469,3.0426,5.2063,4.1764,4.4663,4.0731,0.9453,1.4632,0.4592,0.0002,3.674,2.5019,5.8263,3.6467,0.1468,0.6802,0.0312,4.5473,0.7472,3.4875,1.9265,6.462,6.8332,0.5026,5.8884,0.9787,3.3681,3.4004,1.7815,4.4814,6.5817,0.5704,2.5322,3.774,4.3798,5.744,0.9902,0.0855,5.1552,5.216,4.9973,3.7452,0.4566,2.4843,4.5455,0.01,1.1309,3.4514,3.1053,2.3944,0.5846,0.7878,3.0379,0.4514,1.1526,0.0002,2.5005,4.6257,0.2582,0.011,6.1581,1.7362,2.4317,6.4501,2.0991,6.8265,2.0078,2.6389,2.3535,1.5485,4.762,0.8604,3.9457,0.2839,2.3498,1.4015,4.631,4.9728,0.5699,5.2882,0.3678,3.4881,1.6885,3.758,5.009,0.5042,3.5959,3.1846,4.9428,4.9906,4.9812,2.1607,5.5137,6.3572,4.0211,1.879,1.6217,0.8462,1.8466,7.8337,5.5029,3.0933,3.5257,0.4952,3.4026,5.585,6.4318,1.73,4.2598,1.0071,0.0002,3.6102,0.028,0.0041,3.0289,1.8987,0.1603,3.8916,0.8519,4.5886,0.0679,2.7026,5.1826,2.1624,2.4574,4.2737,4.953,4.5687,1.4714,0.6514,0.6406,4.3807,4.0093,4.8239,0.8541,1.6246,4.3241,4.556,2.1965,2.9214,0.0556,3.9056,1.2013,2.4106,0.9901,3.3176,3.0856,2.6617,0.5305,6.378,0.312,0.8658,0.0002,6.4964,0.036,4.3349,1.5314,1.473,5.9966,0.4485,2.3717,1.2615,4.9617,2.7597,0.8203,1.6472,0.07,1.2762,1.9613,0.5988,3.485,2.8989,3.1382,0.9287,2.3136,3.668,5.5571,1.6237,4.4464,5.4308,3.8271,0.0054,1.3493,3.0577,2.6179,1.9983,0.5766,1.7678,2.0323,2.3558,3.1881,1.3667,0.7704,0.0002,1.5669,2.6923,2.1036,2.2478,3.8191,5.9262,2.9926,4.8758,5.7908,2.2143,4.8139,4.3643,3.4624,1.6719,1.5465,2.2038,1.7953,1.1422,1.2449,4.1073,0.0881,5.3011,2.506,0.0047,5.0417,0.5299,0.032,0.0021,0.6759,1.7485,0.0191,1.0276,5.7602,1.8257,7.3751,5.4719,0.3828,0.4104,2.6133,1.7501,2.6115,1.4302,2.5181,0.8358,4.0061,1.2774,0.7453,1.1502,0.9787,0.967,5.8526,1.5962,5.4211,1.3949,0.0014,1.6117,3.5371,4.298,2.9908,3.4189,0.7062,0.6802,2.3179,0.3176,0.0002,4.5419,6.6456,0.0997,1.1779,2.4701,1.0856,3.3688,5.0864,2.6652,0.4566,0.1895,0.3745,3.3714,4.1123,0.2772,2.6054,9.0439,0.1329,0.0146,4.4897,4.3239,6.7634,5.3535,2.2764,4.3132,1.7801,2.2523,3.6763,1.706,4.2064,6.7639,2.127,1.4032,2.998,0.0537,0.9754,1.0741,0.8924,3.0351,6.2948,0.3651,1.2913,1.6714,2.7757,5.0841,3.5023,1.4991,4.3804,0.6,6.1369,0.2597,5.5018,0.8517,1.8876,5.4283,5.3354,2.4032,4.372,5.2296,9.4847,3.6764,7.5906,0.3833,6.6029,1.8534,1.1913,5.5357,0.4441,0.8865,4.3696,4.7558,4.5014,7.7445,3.685,0.6042,0.0002,5.188,5.0617,0.2268,1.5934,3.1629,7.074,0.0016,2.9465,2.0165,4.0735,1.6165,1.143,0.9452,4.5237,3.3724,3.1826,0.7397,3.1483,0.0003,4.4162,4.609,0.3934,1.3528,0.2846,1.1535,0.0003,0.0109,0.0275,0.0079,0.0034,0.0027,0.0304,0.001,0.0043,0.0071,0.002]}

The last surviving Georgian buildings on the town hall is a Grade II listed Georgian neo @ classical town hall, built in 1841, eight years before Oldham received its borough status.\nOldham and Oldbury are both sites of a significant interest to the town due to their historical and cultural importance. Both towns face two important historical sites \u2013 Oldham and Oldbury. Both sites were home to The Bishop\u2019s Cathedral and its namesake as well as many Georgian landmarks.\nOn the one hand, Oldham is a thriving arts hub with thousands of people making the most out of their summer holidays in the beautiful historic village. On the other, Oldham is in the North West of England, which has a strong history. The town has also hosted the Queen Victoria National Convention, where the mayor is known for his ability to organise events of huge relevance to the people of Oldham. Both sites\u2019 historic connections have been key to Oldham making a place for them.\nNewly-introduced heritage\nOldham is home to the country\u2019s oldest modern cultural heritage sites, the Old Town Hall and Oldham Community Centre. It has long been known as \u201cLittle Old Town\u201d but also has been the home of the arts and culture movement for the last fifty years and has always provided a warm and welcoming environment for its residents. The town hall in Oldham was designed by the architect Richard Lewis of A & T Architecture. They also designed the village hall and its associated building, which has been regularly restored by the government. These landmark buildings are still home to the Old Town Hall.\nThe Old Town Hall is particularly special with its \u201ccadre\u201d which houses a statue of Queen Elizabeth. It was built in 1896 and consists of a modernist Gothic and Gothic style cottage that sits in the same location which housed the original parish centre.

{"id":3092,"ended":true,"length":517,"text":"1 : Nenokkadine earned a distributor share of \u20b9 84 million at the AP @ - @ Nizam box office on its first day, and \u20b9 124 million over its opening weekend. Its net profit stood at \u20b9 2,622 crore during the first week of its sale, and \u20b9 4,974 crore during the same session a year ago.\n\n2 : Nizam now has 1,078 film theatres across the country with its total movie theatres at 33,637. The company said it will open more theatres during the remaining three months of the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\n3 : In the last year, the movie house has opened 14 theatres in 25 cities with the gross margin below 40%. It has also opened more than 11.5 lakh theatres in the country with gross margin at 50%.\n\n4 : As the industry is changing faster during the second half of the current financial year, Nizam has adopted more technology and is offering in most areas, both online and in-person due to increased demand. The company has launched an online portal for entertainment with a direct link through which subscribers or customers can learn details of movies that they will be screening at their own cinemas, and also have access to offline and online content where they can watch the movie on phones. Nizam has more than 22,000 outlets across the country.\n\n5 : Nizam has completed 9.07 lakh screens on a standalone basis in the last financial year with a gross margin of 35%. During the nine months ended March 2020, it opened 46 theatres on standalone basis and closed 15 theatres between March 1 and the end of the quarter ended March 31, 2020.\n\n6 : The company has also made a significant shift in offering offline access on its website at a cost of \u20b9 5,1,500 under a new platform. The portal had been put on hold.\n\n7 : The company has also cut its annual operating cost for the financial year to \u20b9 2,20,000 crore due to low operating margin and high cost of materials and packaging. This meant that in the last financial year 2020-21, the company raised its operating margin from 16 to 14% through lower operating costs. However, the company is now focusing more on selling online as it has seen an immediate decline of sales in the recent past year.

{"id":4747,"ended":true,"length":543,"text":"The final race in Europe took place at Monza. Ferrari's early bid to put Fernando Alonso on pole position by way of using Felipe Massa to offer him a slipstream ended in disaster, leaving Pirelli with one of the weakest chassis in the series.\n\nThe result was a huge blow, causing the FIA to rethink their whole approach on the race, with Perez wanting an identical tyre. But now, they have had an even bigger chance.\n\nPerez, the championship leaders for the past four years, was looking to secure a spot in Spain with the title at stake if he and Alonso kept up their current form.\n\nHaving said that, the German also wanted to keep up his race pace, but the tyre had to be in very bad shape to be made as expensive to match.\n\nThat could not have been clearer on Saturday night as a pair of F1 engineers were tasked to fix the tyre.\n\nPerez was in the final positions of the race but was unable to finish, while Alonso, which would have been more than enough for the Spanish team to overtake him, was third with a disappointing performance.\n\nAnd now for Ferrari, they want to get to the end of their long and bitter rivalry with Pirelli. Pirelli have lost just one race, while Ferrari have taken a huge gap to their rivals.\n\nThe race will now be held at the end of the week at F1's Monza circuit on Sunday, with Ferrari and Ferrari wanting to get their hands on the race car for the first time.\n\nIt will be a challenge for both teams to overcome the gap in the pace of the other team.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about the way Ferrari and Pirelli are fighting over the car, but nothing had been heard from the other teams regarding the technical issues to which the Spaniard had to deal.\n\nFerrari have said that they cannot afford to waste anything.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated situation now,\u201d said the team.\n\n\u201cWe need to do something about it as fast as possible. We can\u2019t expect to be on top of everything because at the moment it\u2019s not a concern.\n\n\u201cBut in the same way it would be nice if we were talking about an extra year. This year we got a new car and at the moment, we are focusing on the current condition. In a short period of time we will get better. This is part of it in a way that can be solved.\u201d\n\nWhile McLaren and McLaren have not said how or who will control the race car, the team will be in a similar position to the Spanish team that also won the Spanish championship last year.\n\nThis time it is only a matter of time before Pirelli and Ferrari have each said whether or not they will support the fight through the technical issues or not.","token_len":605,"entropy":[7.1861,6.9383,3.035,5.2252,5.7157,0.0355,2.231,5.6701,0.161,2.2079,6.3601,2.048,7.9163,7.9292,1.1033,5.4771,6.5805,0.0087,2.2639,4.1442,3.4313,4.3815,4.6453,0.0046,9.685,6.5956,0.0005,0.023,0.0004,2.5103,7.3888,2.3689,0.8544,8.1001,3.8046,6.7503,0.8478,3.6468,2.2533,5.1205,6.3435,0.758,0.0056,2.5621,4.5659,0.78,0.3618,5.1098,6.4871,1.4607,0.4812,2.5284,0.5928,0.6837,0.0005,2.1877,3.7311,1.6745,1.4419,3.5234,1.4925,3.7965,6.4311,1.5832,4.8229,0.1359,5.1869,1.4654,6.6567,2.0136,4.0071,1.0661,2.6754,2.2127,2.3135,7.1725,6.8248,5.1642,7.1035,4.1192,3.9265,3.6234,4.437,1.7817,4.0056,1.516,4.4724,4.101,3.8362,1.9475,2.9916,2.484,0.7067,0.0001,2.2628,0.6199,0.1847,3.1132,2.9994,6.8124,5.679,3.403,1.1502,3.2071,2.3789,0.8267,0.1285,3.1597,4.7147,1.1342,4.3161,0.8883,4.629,0.8302,7.1257,3.5033,1.8688,5.3834,3.1881,0.8858,4.7031,0.9884,4.3576,1.6762,6.126,2.5223,0.6897,3.1306,1.4398,0.4098,1.2001,0.0001,4.8167,4.2339,0.2554,0.1081,1.9518,4.4711,4.7838,2.2343,0.5501,3.4959,3.0898,1.2166,4.9831,1.1128,1.3412,2.9221,2.2771,6.8013,4.7989,2.599,0.1839,4.9004,6.0221,2.9406,0.7895,2.6015,2.1998,5.9071,3.8625,7.9383,5.1267,6.7054,3.2538,0.6752,0.0001,3.9365,4.6979,2.6542,2.3826,0.3763,3.7261,3.348,2.675,1.6756,2.6913,3.9842,4.5826,0.0265,3.8739,0.1007,5.7219,2.9528,3.8385,2.22,3.8736,0.5602,2.3773,1.6094,0.5114,0.0001,2.4757,0.4062,0.0009,2.3064,3.842,1.7518,3.6251,5.5585,2.3066,0.5831,1.1443,4.0006,2.0416,1.7696,0.0052,4.3877,2.1582,3.4473,0.4789,2.5996,6.5579,4.2987,0.3438,0.9369,5.1808,2.6085,1.745,2.0699,1.6135,3.2935,2.7004,2.0381,4.566,1.3391,0.592,1.0935,8.0103,2.9693,1.9803,5.5099,5.1309,0.344,0.1457,0.0001,4.1644,2.8795,4.8769,5.0421,1.7467,3.7023,4.1759,0.5504,2.8287,3.4002,0.817,3.9966,0.1902,2.5944,5.7117,3.4785,3.7452,0.4336,1.8665,1.2005,0.0368,0.0016,0.7035,4.7336,0.0146,0.0018,2.4732,4.072,4.8655,1.0082,1.7052,3.3654,4.4994,1.4109,0.903,4.8867,2.692,3.7749,7.9222,1.3417,3.31,3.2925,1.1535,0.209,0.0001,2.2703,3.7438,2.1821,2.3354,0.9779,3.5904,1.3268,1.2106,3.889,0.0014,1.8158,3.5934,2.4844,5.1415,0.1176,0.393,5.9023,0.0056,2.3828,4.32,2.1103,1.3963,1.6264,4.1953,2.4518,3.7871,5.898,0.2885,2.9798,2.6402,1.7843,0.0526,0.755,3.4969,2.9411,2.6487,0.733,2.0445,0.0967,1.4835,0.4953,0.0002,3.4476,1.558,0.5644,1.2516,5.8426,0.7356,2.1208,0.504,1.482,4.0579,2.1467,3.2478,2.8428,2.3114,5.1101,1.8294,0.6847,4.2137,2.6699,1.5049,0.7586,0.0001,4.6664,2.8848,0.2684,1.4339,1.4419,0.0798,0.7546,1.0006,1.2768,6.1574,3.0908,2.3358,0.1719,0.0014,0.0014,2.0264,4.2571,2.1045,0.8061,4.0883,1.0418,1.3017,5.6679,5.8886,0.818,3.9063,0.6856,1.5703,1.9164,1.2774,4.3635,0.8979,4.9521,1.7467,5.4856,1.4697,1.7912,4.6922,0.043,1.8654,1.455,1.9536,0.2582,0.1841,0.0001,3.2321,0.1236,0.0007,1.698,2.9762,1.0189,0.7908,4.851,2.3569,0.335,4.7626,6.4086,3.419,1.1636,0.0001,11.4687,8.2285,6.3941,14.4275,9.9161,1.5196,2.2397,6.339,1.2404,5.4582,1.7568,2.6737,8.1567,4.7537,2.4111,1.7109,2.4927,0.9567,0.0002,1.0316,0.6377,2.3206,3.4634,0.2729,3.3694,3.1937,1.8086,0.6111,4.7441,3.1668,0.0142,0.4353,0.9325,1.6685,2.9718,9.3799,5.458,0.0454,6.9679,1.565,2.0762,4.0482,1.809,0.5198,4.8633,4.8114,5.7116,0.6321,0.9827,2.3905,2.83,0.1263,0.0095,1.9157,2.4672,6.6962,0.8078,0.965,0.0002,0.364,0.1263,3.7547,4.3125,0.699,4.9237,0.3553,3.624,3.7937,0.5161,3.9522,0.8213,0.5483,2.9118,5.265,0.1389,4.6625,3.4022,3.128,2.7172,4.328,3.1403,1.2103,4.7447,1.6452,2.9299,1.204,1.4618,5.4881,0.3267,0.8572,3.0154,1.059,1.4709,5.7371,0.1951,1.3229,5.5965,5.7865,1.1308,5.4067,3.4319,3.0126,1.1433,0.1818,0.0044,1.4723,1.0153,2.5343,3.3784,1.2385,4.7411,0.9793,4.9711,0.0259,3.8496,5.3724,2.6455,1.5165,2.7911,4.4521,0.9153,4.2958,0.9815,4.4271,4.0194,0.2446,0.0002,5.575,5.4814,1.6759,3.6749,1.5849,3.3336,3.3882,2.9376,6.563,4.8104,1.6183,6.5909,0.2613,2.039,0.3097,0.4101,1.9349,2.0991,3.4429,1.4728,3.3499,1.9573,3.5879,0.3743,1.3409,1.7293,3.494,0.3725,4.9655,5.4929,3.3619,0.5329,3.1059,1.8864,1.2771,0.2128,0.291,0.2941,0.0002,4.1247,2.79,2.6572,1.4798,4.6806,2.0264,0.2168,0.0015,0.3043,0.3409,2.6377,0.0072,0.0011,1.7678,0.7685,3.1518,6.3768,6.0634,4.4658,2.0446,0.0018,0.3086,0.8859,5.8856,1.0048,5.4612,6.8805,0.5706,4.1341,1.2356,4.2973,1.2864,0.1165]}

Nearly two weeks later it was reported that the beach of the small fishing town of Kamloops, British Columbia, was already damaged by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake, the biggest such earthquake since 1974. However, two weeks later, on Monday, another quake was felt as high as 7.4 \u2013 1.5 magnitude \u2013 and triggered tsunami warnings \u2013 all across the country.\n\nIn response, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning immediately after the initial quake, but quickly canceled it. Nearly two weeks later it was reported that the beach of the small fishing town of Kamloops, British Columbia, was already damaged by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake, the biggest such earthquake since 1974.

The warning was issued shortly after 8:30 a.m. (TST). At noon, the warning was updated to indicate that the tsunami warning had been cancelled\u2014possibly due to uncertainty about the impact of the earthquake.\n\nTunneling out of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center is likely to continue until this weekend when Pacific Tsunami Warning Center advisories will be issued for the rest of the Pacific.\n\nAs we reported earlier on the day, the U.S. Geological Survey reported that the fault line in Mt. Hood in British Columbia, Oregon, where Tsunami Warning Center advisories are issued, has lost some land, leaving it with damage as far as the U.S. Pacific.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center\u2019s warning for the area was issued at 8:30 a.m. EST and lasted until 5:15 p.m. ET on Sunday.\n\nIn the meantime, one area still on the quake map showed little damage during the tsunami warnings, but the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued its emergency tsunami warnings for the whole Pacific as of 5:15 p.m. ET.\n\n\u201cThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, along with the Pacific Tsunami Watch Center and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center for the Pacific issued tsunami advisories to alert public members of the region where potential damage is likely on the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.\u201d\n\nIf the tsunami warning is deemed to be imminent, the area affected will receive emergency tsunami warnings with two more warnings later this week. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in a statement that it will release this information as soon as the tsunami warning is issued.","token_len":606,"entropy":[9.9466,6.9692,0.17,0.0131,1.4613,2.4658,3.9409,0.462,3.7906,0.23,9.0156,0.4576,0.6758,5.9144,2.6708,1.359,2.041,6.0598,4.8832,1.3998,1.181,7.3221,3.7319,2.5147,0.418,4.7734,1.5046,4.3232,0.6765,1.2717,8.1796,4.3391,2.268,5.569,4.9159,1.1804,0.2369,5.741,4.0609,0.0002,1.4745,5.9346,0.0387,0.2364,1.0374,4.8628,3.8564,0.8577,1.4786,2.7821,2.6566,0.217,2.1252,0.5883,1.7177,3.2558,4.5448,2.7883,2.7651,2.2497,5.2602,0.1845,5.7841,0.1172,5.6586,2.5485,0.6682,1.511,3.8753,4.119,0.403,4.7317,1.9009,2.0923,4.1181,4.4799,3.8233,0.044,2.6444,0.0928,2.4612,5.7566,4.7977,0.0603,1.9623,1.4643,2.7461,2.0419,5.3706,2.8958,0.2008,6.068,4.141,3.6474,0.5385,1.886,0.2521,0.6469,0.0007,3.0204,4.4635,0.6604,1.1538,3.5731,0.0506,0.0002,0.001,0.0452,0.0676,0.9401,0.4029,0.4019,0.0394,0.8099,0.0555,0.035,0.0696,0.07,0.109,0.0242,0.0136,3.2644,0.0014,0.0239,0.3904,0.0038,0.006,0.0077,0.0166,0.0011,0.0018,0.0017,0.0019,0.0116,0.0003,0.0024,0.0143,0.0005,0.0055,0.0025,0.0139,0.0021,0.0012,0.0013,0.0022,0.0017,0.0008,0.0047,0.0004,0.001,0.0013,0.0022,0.0028,0.0065,0.0017,0.0034,0.0289,0.005,0.0036,0.0059,0.0001,0.026,0.002,0.0028,0.0027,0.0203,0.0002,0.0002,0.0033,0.0036,0.0067,0.0041,0.0053,0.0003,0.0153,0.0661,0.0015,0.0124,0.0006,0.002,0.0016,0.0044,0.0008,0.0014,0.0072,0.0036,0.0006,0.0023,0.0415,0.0075,0.0005,0.0039,0.0098,0.004,0.0063,0.0018,0.0015,0.0016,0.0032,0.0013,1.656,0.0002,2.2529,2.482,0.031,0.0004,0.0071,0.0094,0.0191,0.3929,5.1814,1.727,0.3358,2.9305,1.5712,3.3669,0.8488,5.0165,0.9516,1.826,1.5971,2.2155,2.3259,0.9064,0.5728,5.1473,1.6942,1.3046,2.5043,2.8137,0.0006,0.0411,0.4572,0.4423,2.6681,3.2087,4.1945,1.8687,1.6636,1.8902,3.3825,5.5853,1.909,1.6873,4.6862,1.5968,1.6556,1.9622,1.4167,1.0659,4.0584,0.2918,3.8606,0.9512,0.9333,1.0035,0.0005,0.0002,0.2576,2.8818,5.0083,2.9431,1.9152,4.8841,6.3088,1.1767,0.8327,2.069,1.0338,4.7286,0.4404,4.0302,0.39,1.0984,1.7141,1.3873,1.5573,0.559,1.704,10.1875,5.2784,2.4112,0.0054,6.2642,1.1336,0.6963,4.8914,0.2128,0.4633,1.9896,0.9168,0.5657,0.0002,5.3096,3.714,3.019,3.0402,6.071,0.9396,0.7286,1.7274,1.8891,0.001,0.0178,0.0397,0.0212,3.0202,4.7596,0.4253,3.444,2.7804,4.9997,2.7376,3.7938,5.5958,0.8539,0.0005,0.0085,0.079,0.1471,6.8601,0.0003,0.5729,0.4923,0.2915,1.4772,0.8017,4.5829,0.0011,0.2296,1.0261,1.8114,0.9351,0.0002,4.5635,3.9425,1.7026,1.7466,3.1866,3.6633,3.7453,0.5791,0.9769,4.2455,0.0023,0.0039,0.0244,0.482,0.0106,3.3098,0.5788,1.2805,7.6001,1.2111,2.2008,7.5988,0.0253,2.448,3.7354,4.9273,0.0012,1.695,5.5821,0.3979,3.7969,5.4449,0.0033,0.0963,0.1723,0.0591,3.5376,0.0003,1.4554,0.5708,0.2988,2.1429,6.0157,2.4744,7.0495,2.1582,4.3385,2.1085,2.1128,7.2178,4.5126,2.0367,1.8581,2.4519,4.6039,0.0017,0.0016,0.1381,1.6874,2.1887,1.0625,0.0002,1.7143,2.8884,0.0158,0.0004,0.015,0.0075,0.006,14.1769,8.203,3.8923,3.3507,2.7556,0.5511,3.1066,2.2106,0.666,2.6757,1.9106,0.1002,1.8529,0.1571,0.0009,0.0003,0.1611,4.0952,3.1625,4.5238,1.3898,3.401,0.1847,2.7293,0.3291,0.0005,0.0002,0.1747,2.5549,2.0967,1.5387,1.0038,1.033,0.0002,3.6018,1.6906,1.5919,0.0235,5.888,4.5483,4.9374,3.9183,0.5492,7.4992,2.6997,7.3382,5.4246,1.3534,5.182,0.371,4.1816,2.4435,1.2543,1.6854,2.0894,3.2612,0.0197,0.0004,0.0148,0.0078,0.0147,2.6236,2.7533,5.4288,0.414,1.836,2.1575,1.0186,5.5337,1.9996,4.0947,1.2888,2.4768,0.1114,1.0068,0.0747,0.0007,0.0002,0.0869,0.8037,0.8633,0.437,0.0001,5.7361,6.1715,4.3161,1.3962,0.0105,0.0005,0.0146,0.0066,0.0076,4.7083,3.2751,0.0032,1.0147,1.7622,0.2618,0.0005,0.019,5.6924,2.0393,1.6258,0.7729,0.487,0.0372,0.0006,0.0214,1.376,0.1579,4.2419,1.0179,1.2694,7.6472,0.7077,2.8287,0.007,3.5147,7.1854,6.4232,4.5326,0.4119,0.2854,7.952,6.3453,6.3211,3.4684,1.5539,1.3821,4.8617,1.5355,1.5044,0.9458,0.0008,0.0141,0.1386,0.0279,2.8686,1.29,0.2158,0.0065,0.0005,0.0041,1.854,0.0166,1.3457,3.348,5.6593,0.523,0.0001,4.623,3.0083,1.1381,0.5056,1.7257,5.5474,0.767,0.7729,4.8853,0.3717,1.0997,4.529,1.8031,1.2969,2.4266,3.6452,0.4532,0.955,4.6429,5.7842,5.0592,2.2085,4.8897,2.6644,0.7776,0.5277,2.6116,1.8197,0.0072,0.0006,0.011,0.0653,0.0121,5.4849,2.5515,0.6559,0.4892,0.842,1.175,1.7688,5.1927,5.1871,1.6446,1.9653,0.3826,0.0031,2.3485,1.0976,0.2608,0.7194,0.7533,0.4184]}

{"id":4818,"ended":false,"length":568,"text":"Permanent settlement on Lord Howe was established in June 1834 when the British whaling barque Caroline, sailing from New Zealand and commanded by Captain John < unk >, landed at what is now Nova Scotia Port on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean. In a settlement named Caroline, the island settled a large number of settlers, while a small settlement was established on the island, the largest in Atlantic history. It was there that Queen Victoria founded an annual settlement named Caroline Island, with many local businesses. In 1837, she sailed from Canada to the Atlantic Ocean and set up a permanent settlement on the island. The island, along with Caroline Island and Caroline Island, became part of the British Isles after the annexation of Australia by the French in 1761.\n\nThe colony has not only retained its cultural richness, but as a major port for its tourism. The island was previously considered a \"cultural hub\" of Newfoundland and Labrador during the early 1930s, though more than 90percent of its residents have relocated by ship because of the town's small population. The island has also been noted as one of the most highly rated tourist destinations in the world with a tourist economy estimated at $6.5 billion annually.\n\nHousing for the island has long been a hot subject, as it is one of the oldest settlements on the Island, dating back to the 19th century. Most of the main houses, including the small residence and dining hall, have been demolished because of the rapid growth of the town and its cultural richness. According to the census set by the British Antarctic Survey, only nine houses remained in the island's historical range. The rest are still at risk from fire, water and damage caused by the storms. The town's population is estimated at 7,070, with the average household size at $12,200.\n\nIt is currently being developed as a tourist destination. The largest island in the world is Caroline Island in the Atlantic Ocean, about 20.6 miles north of the capital, New Brunswick of Canada. Caroline Island is one of the most developed islands in the world along with the islands of Saint John, Saint John Island and Saint John Island. On November 10, 2016, it was announced that the island will be officially opened as part of the Greater New Brunswick Government's \"New Jersey Tourism Development\" in the new year's time.\n\nFor the past 20 years, Caroline Island has been a tourist destination, with more than 800 people planning to visit per year by boat or by foot. In 2007, the town established a new year-round, self-contained accommodation camp for international travelers, which has allowed 500 tourists to arrive on the island every year for 18 years. The village itself has been the first to be developed in the town, with the first residents to move to the town in 2007.

{"id":1038,"ended":true,"length":572,"text":"Sundays were spent at home producing Eight Passion Proteins on his printing press. Waldemar Januszczak described it as worthy of Heath Robinson, who was known for his cartoons of ancient contraptions. The book contains 60,000 pages of sketches of machines, drawings, photographs, audio and video, including a large black-toasted picture made of wood, steel and stone. As the world is consumed through the coronavirus outbreak, the art world is also at a loss for space. The art museum has turned to a much different mode of transport, the internet, with artists like Michael Jordan and Michael Keaton on the canvas. In one of the first shows of the new year, the artist also participated in an art exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History, where he talked about his inspiration for his art. With all those artists, he spoke of one thing at a time, a need to communicate with the world. He called it a form of empathy that he feels like sharing in order for the world to feel that we can do something together. In that connection, the art museum has begun using the internet as an outlet to do a number of projects. According to the artist, there were only seven exhibitions, some with work that was already in print before the pandemic, as well as one exhibition that was finished in the first ten days of the current spring holidays. However, as his art continues, it will keep going until it is finished, although this exhibition will not take place until March 2.\nA look back: The \u201cArt of Michael\u201d exhibition\nMichael Jordan\nMichael Jordan created his famous \u201cArt of Michael\u201d exhibition in the 1990s, a concept that was inspired by the man himself and in which the world works together to share each other. A major figure in the late 20th century, it was first featured in the United States during the first world war. In a photo accompanying the exhibition \u201cThe Art of Michael Jordan\u201d, Jordan said that the exhibition was \u201ca time for the world to share\u201d. He then noted that Jordan did not have his first title until he married an African American girl. This meant that in the same year, Jordan was married three times before divorcing his first wife, Barbara, who took over the publishing business from W.A. Knight. Jordan, and his wife, died in 2009. Although his death was not related to the work, the couple was still together and, despite his death, they lived happily ever after. In addition to Jordan himself, a number of other artists have participated in the exhibition since then, such as the American sculptor Michelangelo, former president of the National Museum of African American History and the director of the National Museum of Indigenous Art.\nWhat kind of work will you be making this year?\nThis year, we are building a new exhibition called the Art of Michael Jordan, which will explore how every generation comes about the day and through the history it inspires us.","token_len":611,"entropy":[7.5676,6.104,5.01,2.4233,3.5004,8.2214,13.1915,11.181,9.459,5.0964,0.1557,4.6752,4.725,10.1139,2.112,1.2455,10.4662,3.3116,0.0635,10.4314,2.5999,1.5953,3.87,1.0636,7.2949,2.7733,0.2694,11.2294,0.1109,13.7957,6.2163,1.9956,1.8171,2.4054,4.9345,1.1263,0.8147,7.1843,2.5444,7.2612,11.2998,0.1313,0.8748,2.683,4.3438,4.4261,7.34,3.4102,0.0728,1.7134,1.1341,2.9692,2.1989,5.4465,1.2738,3.9254,1.1562,4.5485,0.584,6.3683,2.1033,0.5657,1.6487,4.9334,2.1569,4.7698,4.9251,2.2362,8.602,6.1866,5.0438,6.7735,1.6823,5.7635,2.0206,5.6792,0.8265,3.6089,0.6427,5.2714,2.3501,5.1907,5.3742,5.8174,7.2549,1.4498,10.4595,6.1681,2.0898,3.5635,0.7034,1.7747,6.1988,4.8018,1.2299,3.283,3.8274,3.3963,0.6438,1.3847,8.3739,0.6978,2.4977,4.9022,4.4081,2.6148,4.6003,0.7947,2.0499,6.1064,4.3981,5.907,0.1139,3.737,1.4471,3.3193,6.5249,0.8116,3.9984,7.0525,3.6105,4.8705,5.0392,1.2399,4.1162,6.6384,0.0939,4.0998,1.8357,7.1427,0.6349,3.348,4.5211,1.2096,0.9496,3.0632,4.7013,1.2228,1.1494,2.7217,2.5466,0.2582,1.6695,3.4983,6.1548,6.568,0.0746,2.0488,2.6512,1.6532,1.9081,0.5895,4.9392,0.5623,0.0791,0.0556,0.0026,1.8831,2.2882,0.4271,6.1001,0.1931,1.4162,4.8271,0.3634,3.0938,3.9302,0.5642,6.1168,4.5629,4.7043,3.2141,1.7567,2.9883,6.2687,1.5526,5.57,1.5072,4.3759,0.498,0.0161,1.977,3.3261,4.7562,1.0931,3.8078,1.6757,1.7141,0.7198,0.946,2.3927,3.8025,0.9724,2.6163,4.8017,0.0464,6.1164,3.4097,2.8001,4.8208,4.4835,3.2117,4.1411,4.8557,3.9821,1.9292,0.6522,0.0456,3.2115,4.2257,5.0495,2.5154,3.3781,1.8715,4.5507,0.2805,3.4672,4.6701,6.2036,0.4177,2.1995,2.8791,0.9265,1.8682,4.3313,3.8808,1.7497,0.9042,2.0506,1.8118,2.935,1.3517,4.574,3.1832,3.6019,0.0159,3.414,1.307,5.2696,0.0007,1.6329,2.2996,0.2063,3.6222,3.8668,3.7602,4.3671,4.2165,3.7922,5.1068,3.7242,7.1906,2.769,1.6439,4.165,2.3568,3.5479,3.9399,0.834,3.6184,0.0091,1.4555,4.9333,0.4069,0.006,3.3971,3.295,1.8642,1.2187,4.3472,1.2636,2.5548,3.7578,5.8079,0.2705,0.7946,0.6386,5.4583,9.1569,7.0448,0.2615,5.337,0.0335,3.3832,4.0823,2.5936,3.1666,2.0762,2.415,1.7121,5.5557,3.2075,3.834,1.6126,1.3642,2.6083,2.294,6.0277,4.1321,4.9744,1.2235,1.491,3.784,0.133,0.4904,3.7908,5.0298,0.9454,1.5707,6.4106,5.2334,2.0485,3.5036,2.3635,12.891,6.6967,7.9016,1.4708,6.3789,6.0571,7.3287,6.983,2.1037,3.2729,1.8323,3.044,2.2205,0.1519,5.6627,1.9658,3.621,6.2846,0.2379,2.2749,0.0486,0.1514,0.1475,0.0281,1.5524,0.8569,2.8388,3.3471,0.0502,1.3013,3.3974,5.8917,1.2949,2.3023,3.0659,0.098,1.3414,5.7981,1.6062,2.6764,5.14,1.9225,2.8259,3.9772,5.8896,3.4324,0.8546,3.9615,7.0414,0.05,4.2091,4.0994,5.4759,4.1626,0.4752,0.7156,5.6709,3.7983,0.0045,0.1191,0.3542,4.6995,1.0306,5.467,3.4542,0.6592,1.2575,5.212,0.189,3.2844,0.4188,3.8376,4.0295,0.0383,1.325,2.4614,3.4768,4.9386,5.4519,0.3668,0.9868,10.0089,0.1218,1.9713,1.6555,0.0532,0.1118,6.5415,0.5444,0.1506,1.1493,1.2952,4.785,1.417,1.8536,2.129,1.5028,9.493,0.5836,2.2577,4.4777,1.2857,2.6106,1.3998,0.3054,1.8762,5.1471,2.0567,2.1715,2.5689,4.4783,5.1907,0.2618,6.1017,4.3752,0.2875,3.0031,3.7711,4.5142,5.8991,2.376,2.2526,7.2202,5.6913,4.0944,2.0727,4.0154,1.2291,3.7829,4.5602,0.1543,4.3583,1.2673,4.8559,1.3181,1.1507,2.9119,2.0215,4.5225,5.597,0.0683,4.0779,4.4678,0.0077,0.7457,1.2555,0.0221,1.0504,4.8893,2.9049,1.7115,5.5975,2.5986,1.1005,5.6916,1.2412,2.8357,7.6645,0.8836,3.8962,0.0591,6.9824,0.9825,3.0369,3.5876,5.4704,0.8528,0.7251,1.1312,7.2864,0.6291,3.9027,0.6607,4.7437,2.8268,4.9791,1.2556,1.982,6.0512,0.0686,0.3974,5.123,1.4484,1.5997,4.3803,2.7492,3.1144,3.2994,3.0921,4.8265,3.7536,2.1915,2.6566,0.2055,2.435,4.5236,1.9735,0.2105,0.0442,0.267,2.6416,3.4592,0.3649,3.4229,4.1868,0.1218,3.5864,0.6821,0.0019,1.1316,0.6382,1.6909,3.9077,0.1188,0.4125,1.1103,4.4813,3.0021,1.293,3.0411,0.0014,2.9696,4.3309,4.5852,0.0295,5.9264,0.3313,1.7724,6.6952,4.839,0.5616,0.4894,2.8921,2.7415,0.0273,0.8637,0.3153,1.7261,1.3654,2.7622,3.7564,0.0597,0.4415,3.0871,1.0112,0.0576,6.9365,1.169,1.0519,1.6925,4.8931,5.2964,0.0027,2.1073,3.2682,2.9354,0.5419,3.4616,2.5681,0.1433,0.1689,0.9945,3.4038,0.2602,0.8619,2.238,1.4846,5.4795,0.9743,1.7847,1.0395,1.9826,2.3599,2.0497,0.1132,0.1393,1.9516,2.7387,1.057,0.698,3.912,3.4544,7.2898,5.1123,5.2281,6.2599,4.3276,6.7027,5.3226,7.025,0.7667,6.1205,4.608,5.4583,2.2327,1.0875]}

{"id":3651,"ended":false,"length":536,"text":"Ashdod is home to the Israeli Andalusian Orchestra, which performs Andalusian classical music. It is an Arabic music style that originates from Moorish Iberia or Al @ - @ Andalus, has been considered one of the best performing European orchestras.\n\nThe orchestra's founding founder, Alistair O'Brien, started working as a vocalist for the BBC's Westend in 1985 as well as the New York City Symphony & Opera, and has recorded several award-winning operas and plays.\n\nBut, one of the best concerts in the past 20 years for musicians is Ashdod, because the group play every Friday and Saturdays beginning at 7pm and ending at 5pm.\n\n\"We've had some of the greatest concerts of my music career,\" Ashdod says. \"Ashdod not only has an amazing array of music - there are three pieces to play, we've really taken a lot of creative risks in the way of our music and in many cases the risk is actually worthwhile\".\n\nAshdod is also currently playing the San Francisco Festival of Music, also hosted by the San Francisco Bay Area Festival of Music.\n\nLast year Ashdod won the first annual Tony Award for Musical Comedy.\n\n\"It took me quite a few years to find a position that I was really interested in,\" Ashdod says. \"In addition to that, I was really nervous because it felt like I didn't have a major role in the company being a musical theatre ensemble.\"\n\nThe show has been filmed in London but also takes place on other continents.\n\n\"It was important to make sure that we were both in London and in London the same time. We were really in a position to be able to do each and every performance in a way that was both respectful of each other and at the same time respectful of the diversity of different cultures and languages,\" Ashdod says.\n\nThe group's rehearsals are also conducted by Ashdod and his fellow cast members, who are also in London, Sydney, Berlin, New York, and Toronto.\n\nThe show is also being staged in Amsterdam and London, in the same week which was originally intended for the show, says Ashley.\n\n\"We're doing it in two separate locations which would make it easier for everybody, and we're very excited about that.\"\n\nAshdod also has a range of other solo and group performance gigs, including concerts by the London Philharmonic\/Festival Orchestra and Royal Philharmonic Concerts, and a multi-play theatre in London, which has recently been reopened.\n\nAshdod says he had to wait several months before the show happened, but that he felt so lucky to spend the time that happened to him.\n\n\"It means a lot coming into two weeks with no rehearsals, and a lot of the audience was really excited about seeing me perform live. They were really looking forward to this.\"","token_len":612,"entropy":[6.6327,4.7922,3.8577,6.7539,0.1238,2.002,6.7971,10.3062,1.699,0.2107,8.2153,1.0281,1.8164,3.1674,10.22,0.0212,0.0152,3.4359,0.318,1.291,3.3268,1.2963,4.075,6.9124,3.6624,6.8615,1.7444,6.4963,0.0009,0.8533,9.3813,0.0288,7.0174,0.0885,1.2964,5.8319,4.625,13.5655,6.4076,8.8489,4.2254,0.0592,4.3039,7.9966,1.3248,5.6246,2.4524,0.0109,0.1504,1.7637,3.1656,4.9104,3.3813,0.0027,1.6868,1.8234,0.0363,2.3357,3.3979,2.5821,5.1323,5.4469,0.6435,4.3769,5.7535,0.0075,4.0676,1.1081,2.198,0.2353,5.3015,4.1995,2.3059,0.4777,5.9995,0.027,2.0056,1.008,7.1703,3.2087,6.4828,7.7208,6.4335,4.5938,4.4293,3.8255,0.042,2.651,5.576,0.8046,3.8469,0.6565,6.457,3.1545,2.3395,1.7832,2.5914,4.7587,3.1378,5.9025,0.4419,0.0057,2.9132,0.0082,1.7956,3.0108,0.7224,1.2727,0.0003,4.8165,3.776,6.1687,0.6523,0.8824,4.6988,7.0067,1.439,1.3368,6.8436,2.9033,0.0282,4.3222,5.6788,2.2714,9.7392,0.1181,0.0018,1.4788,6.2831,1.9336,4.6651,4.9917,5.0795,2.7981,2.8055,3.4371,7.1256,0.4559,1.9606,0.8429,2.7724,1.2511,0.1374,3.0706,0.5809,0.4643,0.7574,0.0004,2.2508,1.7699,3.1431,2.4489,3.1621,3.6433,0.1723,2.7519,1.8558,1.566,2.9951,7.366,0.4743,1.629,3.0462,0.0179,0.0016,2.0332,0.2753,0.4553,6.0682,0.0361,0.0015,7.7018,0.0298,2.0805,2.617,1.6261,5.2933,0.0108,2.6686,4.8242,3.7883,0.6758,4.9214,5.9278,3.9455,3.6887,2.1923,4.6454,2.0878,6.2643,4.06,2.5013,1.3954,0.2276,5.0068,3.4983,2.6314,1.8675,3.8327,2.991,3.0371,2.1882,2.1878,2.5909,5.2863,1.728,2.5867,5.331,1.7045,4.9777,5.1174,5.3586,0.1919,0.0002,2.78,0.0162,0.0019,2.3629,1.8691,5.1381,2.9737,2.2604,7.2929,0.4658,7.7318,0.5981,0.8277,1.6343,5.7224,3.6459,0.1258,0.9131,1.9273,0.0306,5.3385,0.2055,6.6259,0.7577,0.3935,0.8855,0.6372,0.0002,5.215,0.3694,2.6953,0.0063,0.0021,2.6172,0.6963,5.0805,4.9621,5.7302,0.5318,0.5995,5.8532,5.8995,2.6213,1.0057,0.0002,1.4626,2.015,5.5293,1.3443,3.5767,0.1426,3.3498,0.3904,0.5162,3.5728,1.637,4.7427,2.2484,1.3743,2.2951,2.2689,2.5252,0.0129,1.7508,1.2416,0.0038,0.0028,0.2515,0.1782,0.3487,4.3042,4.6849,0.1783,2.4993,0.6532,0.6665,1.9647,3.2552,5.1233,2.9805,2.7672,3.9214,0.2801,1.0068,3.1833,0.0009,0.9368,1.3716,6.4788,2.3633,0.7025,0.8847,5.1231,6.862,3.2,4.1604,1.5566,7.3722,1.9871,0.1035,0.0002,2.4608,5.0798,2.9375,1.4203,4.2582,0.8879,2.597,4.4257,4.7905,4.8665,0.0677,2.5582,5.9842,1.4081,0.8343,0.5906,0.0002,1.1769,1.7946,2.0179,4.9678,0.9067,3.6577,0.7261,0.7063,1.5133,1.4039,5.4211,2.6141,2.598,1.4234,2.3603,2.767,4.8679,2.7674,2.0147,2.5877,1.8965,1.8841,3.8933,3.465,2.3104,2.0146,0.726,2.8397,1.5715,0.0052,2.3271,6.0065,4.0116,0.0946,2.5238,2.4733,2.0129,3.5375,0.1318,1.5266,3.5633,5.6346,1.5597,2.6898,0.0543,0.7659,4.9402,0.1028,0.02,0.0086,3.5473,0.0959,0.7791,5.2107,0.3883,5.0009,1.2439,1.4386,3.2329,1.1781,0.9481,0.0053,0.0031,0.2988,0.0461,0.2056,0.0002,2.0639,3.695,2.4765,6.6754,0.0471,1.2498,2.6896,4.1492,2.3779,4.1589,0.0416,0.0066,2.5973,1.4117,4.2863,6.0318,0.3258,1.4796,1.9456,1.9461,2.0847,3.9269,1.851,2.4964,5.0055,0.9319,3.3666,0.6738,3.0018,0.0721,0.8615,2.686,4.0347,0.1975,0.2818,0.0002,2.1381,2.4567,1.2762,2.5167,2.4561,3.1026,0.6659,5.282,1.5178,2.3913,1.3897,4.0874,3.1203,3.0271,5.1815,5.8847,3.7702,3.2305,4.4744,1.8916,1.067,3.7465,2.804,3.4663,7.4112,2.6475,0.2451,0.0002,0.9522,1.3161,1.6281,2.816,2.0477,1.5022,3.7378,3.6921,1.5722,4.3853,4.7856,2.4335,0.5438,3.5337,0.64,4.1249,3.0336,2.5634,1.8417,0.9685,3.7624,1.3696,0.7258,2.5986,3.7293,0.2208,0.0002,1.4983,0.0218,0.0027,3.7597,2.4289,0.9883,7.295,0.0041,2.056,5.461,2.6267,2.1278,4.1711,3.7335,1.5777,0.8065,4.1015,3.9014,1.9607,3.8366,2.0803,0.0003,0.0039,8.536,4.4308,2.2774,1.7742,1.4125,6.656,1.9192,0.0013,0.0301,4.6591,1.7187,1.8118,1.6996,2.4842,5.2747,0.0438,6.0332,5.5883,2.4585,1.3988,1.9161,2.3335,2.7206,4.1295,0.9948,6.1955,0.7095,0.2526,0.0002,2.161,0.0201,0.0024,1.5598,1.1734,5.0593,2.6144,4.8088,3.2017,1.0804,1.834,2.6226,1.2825,5.47,1.2893,1.3103,2.2957,0.9451,4.1803,5.2522,1.5247,0.7015,6.4855,1.6812,1.3099,4.5755,6.2011,1.3494,0.7985,0.8358,0.2101,0.0001,0.1905,1.6937,5.5639,0.899,0.049,7.6607,3.4541,8.3045,3.0258,2.5799,3.0053,4.5543,0.0087,1.7437,1.5658,3.826,0.871,0.2241,3.7411,4.8872,3.0885,1.9817,1.626,1.2032,4.5925,1.4809,1.5706,3.9838,1.8246,3.8081,1.1705,1.2862,3.4115,0.1132,0.0386,4.4765,3.3294]}
{"id":634,"ended":true,"length":566,"text":"Miami began the second quarter in possession of the ball and facing a first down at the Virginia Tech 30 @ - @ yard line. From there, it took Miami just four plays to score \u2013 on the next play from 25 yards, they went for three points and went up 29-24. It wasn\u2019t until that short of a drive that Miami began to find their rhythm. It was a lot of fun for those of us at the time \u2013 I mean sure, the Heat didn\u2019t put everything on the line in the first quarter. It certainly isn\u2019t a good quarter.\nMiami was led offensively by both Taniela Harder and Jameer Nelson who set up the second scoring attempt of the half. It was a big one for Miami as hard work paid off to turn it around for the first time since December of 2018 at home against Virginia Tech. Miami was led by Harder who had 19 points and Nelson had 13 in the first quarter. Harder had 15 in the red zone while Nelson had eight in the game.\nIn the fourth quarter Miami went on to lose 33-25 in a matchup where the Heat took a huge series of plays, some big ones that would have been costly for Miami, but unfortunately, they weren't able to pull it off. Miami is 6-1 since winning its home game at Richmond (12-7) on December 17 before the weekend. Miami is at home to Arizona State on Saturday (11:30) before meeting the Coyotes (11 p.m.) tonight (a game of the weekend in Atlanta).\nThe Heat will have to sit down and play the Arizona Cardinals (0-2) next week. The loss to Phoenix makes it clear that the teams are still getting to see each other again. They will go head-to-head in this rivalry two times during the regular season, beginning January 5th. If they win on Saturday, Miami will tie the Heat for 12th place in the Eastern Division with the Cardinals for the best record in the Eastern Division. Miami won just once in those matches, in Miami\u2019s last year as a member of the Red Storm. So it would be unfair to overstate the difficulty with this rivalry.\nMiami will be playing at the Miami Gardens (9:30 p.m.) Sports and Entertainment Complex on Friday, January 19th. This game is free to stream online on all platforms except the online game, ESPN, FOX and CBS.

{"id":3025,"ended":true,"length":540,"text":"Bellaire's housing lots are 75 feet ( 23 m ) by 130 feet ( 40 m ), allowing for houses larger than those that could be built on typical 50 feet ( 15 m ) lots, the developer says.\n\nIn addition to the three commercial and commercial projects, Bellaire has signed a long-term lease with Vickers-Bass, the developer of an eight-story (15 m )-story (12 m )-unit tower at the nearby New Orleans International Airport.\n\nVickers-Bass said the tower is \"a very important part of the airport because by the time you put towers on one side of the airport, you're getting more parking,\" which is more convenient for travelers.\n\nBut there are also concerns because the tower is built as a mixed-use housing unit, making it difficult to move out of its current location at 42nd and North East. \"We'll be putting out a more than $80 million order for the project by the end of the year or early next year,\" said Vickers-Bass representative Eric Scharff.\n\nBellaire also has long been a stronghold for downtown redevelopment. A series of housing projects that have failed to attract real estate and finance in the bay area have been blocked off and left undeveloped.\n\nHowever, Bellaire will not let the tower get out of its current configuration forever as it will be converted into a multi-family unit, according to its website. In February, Bellaire purchased a four-story (5 m ) tower for only $1.65 million. Since then, it has sold the tower and bought the adjoining land at a cost of the roughly $8 million it will buy from the airport.\n\nA city staff report this spring found Bellaire was on the brink of approving a $1.7 million lease with Vickers-Bass before a city board agreed in 2015 to lease the tower for a fee paid out through the City of New Orleans\u2019 rental agency for the purpose of affordable housing. The lease will be enforced by the city\u2019s rental agency until the agreement is reached. The contract said no further rents would be paid to Vickers-Bass, though it said it is investigating what caused the lease to expire.\n\n\"We appreciate the opportunity to offer affordable housing as a part of our community investment,\" Scharff said in a statement. \"A multifamily housing project, that will connect a portion of New Orleans' economy with the broader market of both urban and rural areas, is in a unique position to enable the city and the surrounding community to develop a thriving, growing community for its residents.\"\n\nBellaire plans to use the $1.65 million acquisition price of the tower to move forward with its redevelopment project and build more than three dozen retail stores under the building.

{"id":1624,"ended":false,"length":569,"text":"Few records of the church's history exist, possibly because no single denomination or organization took ownership. Several Christian denominations held meetings at Old Pine Church, including the Schwarzenau Brethren ( or Brethren of the Eastern Church), where they held Christian meetings for three months. The Brethren were called the \"Bible of the Christian World\". It was founded in the 16th century through \"A New Way of being\". Although not every Lutheran denomination offered Christian services or baptisms, the Christian Church maintained Christian services in both historic and contemporary churches and held hundreds of Christian congregations at its doors on and off throughout Southern California between 1872 and 1945.\n\nSeveral years after the formation of the Brethren, the church moved to a new location where it has not had a presence since the early 1970s. The first Protestant baptisms were in 1961 at St. George Baptist Church, which closed in 1982. In 1995, the church's first Lutheran baptism took place at the nearby Pabst and Loyola Lutheran Church, both where the church has not been active. The church has also hosted several Lutheran churches that have remained with the Brethren through the years or had their congregations disbanded, some even to the point that their congregations were destroyed by fire in 1999.\n\nOn April 9, 2000, the United States Senate passed a resolution in which the Brethren of the East Catholic Church of Southern California (or CCCSS), \"the church that has been active on and off since its creation,\" was proclaimed officially. Since 1998, the church has been designated an apostate and served as the CCCSS at St. George Lutheran church (now demolished) in downtown San Bernardino, since 2005. The church used to host many Lutheran services, and has provided many services.\n\nThe Brethren have had some prominent roles in the church's history, but few members are considered to have any important contributions to the church's mission. There were no prominent members of the church. From 1991 of the earliest meetings for the Brethren were held at Old Pine Church in Downtown San Bernardino and in December of that year there were an average of six members at that time in the church. In October 2007, three of the Brethren were appointed leaders of the Church's Board of Supervisors. However, no other leaders were present at that meeting. The CCCSS is an official Lutheran church in Southern California located with an area of 28,500 square feet, including offices, a museum, worship services, an office space and an exhibit space. Many of its missions missions in Southern California were transferred to the Brethren last year.\n\nToday, the church is one of eight churches in Southern California which the United States Government deems to be apostate or being of poor or middle class status. While the majority of the church is owned by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there are a few branches of the church that are not members of the church.

{"id":711,"ended":true,"length":550,"text":"Guitar Hero was created from a partnership between RedOctane, then their own company that produced specialized video game controllers, and Harmonix, a music video game development company who had previously produced Frequency, Firewatch, and the upcoming Battle Royale.\n\nThe band's logo features the words \"Amen To That,\" while they have lyrics that read \"In time\u2026, the world is coming apart.\" It's unclear whether they originally had an official song named \"Merry Christmas\" but the band has since released a new one titled \"Wishing You Merry Christmas,\" which plays as the title to the video, and that video also features songs from their \"Best Song Ever.\"\n\nThe band's name is partly related to Harmonix, the company that had the video game and controller manufacturer license to use on their music videos. The song 'Merry December' goes on to talk about how much we need to let a \"happy Christmas\" music video that's made use of our creativity go viral is the right time to make it. The company has also made a number of social videos in support of the band's name, which should do the trick.\n\nFellow guitarist and former DJ Paul Staley has signed to join the band. Both he and the band were in attendance for one of the first official video game shows, during which he performed \"Wishing You Merry Christmas\" in an all-white background.\n\nIn addition, the band appears to have shared their music video with a number of other companies:\n\nMerry Christmas\n\nCrazy Love\n\nThe band released songs for their new video for the song \"In Time...\" in late December (Image credit: the band)\n\nMerry Christmas is a song by the guitar-driven and electric-based band Crazy Love. It plays as the title of their video for the song \"In Time.\"\n\nThey released a new version of the song on the band's YouTube.com channel, 'Mercy. We also got to see video for the single \"This Merry Christmas\", which gets the song off the top of our head, and is a fun track to listen to.\n\nIn the song's official YouTube video, fans can see a little video where they hear the song's cover by the band. However, the video is not actually from their own video, which was shot just prior to releasing the video.\n\nIf you have a loved one or friend who has COVID-19, there's a chance that they might have been diagnosed with any of the listed COVID-19 illnesses that affect you, so if you'd like to get in on the fun and help spread the word here's a few more tips about the best thing that's made the world of COVID-19 more safe than ever.\n\nThis article was originally published on The View at 6:42 a.m. today (8 a.m. ET \/ 6:42 p.m. PT), and will be updated as more information becomes available.","token_len":616,"entropy":[9.4969,0.2984,4.1442,5.8932,4.0978,4.1162,1.9837,6.7941,0.2971,7.0828,8.721,1.0682,1.8907,7.9843,6.3247,2.2727,3.3855,4.1537,3.4011,8.329,6.0796,1.8119,3.7571,1.4755,0.7195,5.6856,0.0069,1.244,1.9092,3.1246,2.8833,0.6845,3.5401,1.0062,5.5638,2.4412,3.2535,2.5757,12.1751,2.3543,6.8164,1.4374,0.4406,0.5565,3.3268,3.2078,6.8972,3.0048,0.6485,1.2551,0.0005,1.9502,3.3923,1.4805,5.9511,2.9427,1.9486,2.7952,0.2669,4.7132,5.1327,5.2658,6.7027,3.6844,2.8381,4.6727,2.7234,6.6376,1.5992,1.9143,0.7153,4.9193,4.558,4.797,6.5904,2.4548,2.4636,2.3709,3.9285,4.8854,0.9162,3.7918,1.098,2.8671,1.8947,2.1767,5.0316,4.4789,3.0627,1.5485,3.123,5.7499,1.3198,4.8019,3.6594,0.9748,1.0851,3.6511,2.8812,0.8751,2.2398,1.2762,2.3052,1.1898,1.7371,3.2297,3.0479,0.0736,4.6534,3.6139,1.1618,3.5375,0.3315,2.2074,0.7024,4.9991,3.2646,2.1454,2.4157,3.9628,1.1751,3.474,5.1865,1.8329,4.1597,3.875,3.7059,0.7969,3.9578,0.9352,2.3693,4.7377,6.2264,4.6888,0.4917,2.2063,0.4637,0.0002,1.9593,0.8221,1.5338,4.6078,1.5724,7.396,3.6861,0.0162,4.7668,0.0014,1.643,2.2902,1.6083,0.7789,4.9638,3.9576,4.845,0.3458,4.377,5.6458,5.1707,6.0389,2.1831,2.3185,6.8701,1.7986,2.6392,1.7453,0.7367,1.777,4.2195,6.7842,2.0492,0.0155,8.0098,0.1367,6.5182,2.3697,0.0776,5.6529,0.0354,2.0146,3.2041,5.7148,4.6168,0.3717,5.6845,5.8908,4.7748,3.4719,1.232,0.5068,7.5636,0.0153,5.8755,2.4514,3.8809,7.1463,0.0056,3.9091,4.7368,3.0266,2.1359,8.6346,2.6074,4.7388,2.863,0.3612,2.1952,1.5805,1.4064,2.9688,4.6836,1.8464,1.926,3.546,1.2943,3.0884,0.0021,7.4414,5.297,3.1448,2.5124,0.0421,1.2019,2.2073,1.5453,5.9734,0.9799,2.5479,5.8818,5.4071,1.9041,0.4348,0.6433,0.3896,0.0002,5.6911,6.1009,3.8528,2.7594,4.121,6.3536,5.1725,5.3854,5.7905,2.3549,5.9987,1.6429,5.7351,0.5473,0.1803,1.8388,5.8984,3.9447,0.0585,3.4566,0.4657,4.1971,3.9158,2.1876,2.7833,5.1946,0.4124,0.6895,2.8655,3.7006,4.0137,2.0585,2.4684,3.2503,4.7434,0.8613,3.9216,3.2176,2.5941,3.4559,0.257,0.092,0.3257,0.0093,0.8136,2.2832,3.3865,4.4179,0.1972,3.3563,5.6132,0.5455,1.056,0.0002,3.7001,1.4989,1.9643,1.9305,0.4756,6.4991,0.4678,0.9505,5.2965,2.7274,3.6173,1.4509,1.02,2.3273,1.5037,0.0061,1.1103,3.2358,5.7711,1.5359,0.0002,4.5458,0.9388,0.2447,3.4254,0.0002,5.2961,2.7503,4.3177,0.5588,0.0003,3.0998,7.0314,3.3847,6.3291,2.6589,2.2028,2.1527,3.2831,6.3023,2.4875,1.7218,0.9436,4.8226,0.1776,5.1796,1.9609,3.9754,2.7891,5.3108,7.8521,2.5484,0.0603,6.6326,1.2072,0.4743,0.3156,0.0002,3.249,0.0385,0.0943,1.9566,1.5038,1.3096,2.8848,1.2993,7.0412,1.865,2.3934,5.7036,4.4654,1.7564,4.3423,0.6686,2.159,0.0019,1.1917,1.3489,4.1201,2.1589,1.5379,0.5612,0.956,1.4775,2.2656,1.0643,1.0907,0.2598,0.6462,0.3564,0.0131,1.4625,1.1881,0.0002,4.2852,2.8075,1.4215,1.7339,3.8489,0.1259,0.6586,0.3575,1.7332,3.034,0.9899,0.0268,2.139,7.1593,2.8791,1.5156,2.0885,6.33,6.8333,0.9953,4.6422,4.3401,7.6691,2.9453,3.2137,1.8243,6.7651,3.1382,1.2841,5.2281,0.6062,5.708,9.1123,0.0931,4.7446,0.4838,6.2008,1.5806,2.5066,3.5838,0.4762,4.4121,0.0736,2.8192,2.0756,3.0848,1.4608,3.6804,2.651,5.0982,3.8691,0.8851,1.3306,0.0264,1.0334,0.5162,0.0002,3.4382,1.9065,3.1197,2.6375,4.8845,2.7872,0.84,0.1104,5.5818,0.5378,0.9901,2.194,5.183,3.507,3.6689,2.3707,4.2853,1.2943,1.9075,2.0877,6.1323,4.1024,2.2759,0.7243,1.0809,5.1119,0.0323,1.326,1.3255,2.2473,2.3881,2.9673,2.8906,3.4564,3.7646,1.6825,1.9743,2.2707,2.2156,2.7785,5.1631,3.4981,0.0082,5.4908,0.8413,1.0697,0.565,0.9511,0.0002,5.01,0.4802,3.2318,1.9861,6.7349,0.062,2.9911,2.7458,0.9337,1.9061,13.8431,9.5121,5.6674,8.6231,2.5103,5.6025,1.1493,0.8704,1.1022,1.6043,1.2644,2.2335,2.0575,2.7048,5.9084,0.0462,5.5521,1.2378,0.4091,4.4825,3.785,0.0998,0.2497,0.1176,2.9055,3.3152,4.6532,4.435,1.9561,2.0934,2.962,0.3308,4.6897,0.0643,0.1659,2.4721,1.7673,5.8787,0.1671,1.6939,2.3501,2.3195,2.8519,0.3493,0.0749,5.868,1.9147,1.1417,2.6543,3.5927,3.1677,3.9875,2.6326,4.8313,4.441,2.9403,2.4088,7.1807,2.2505,4.8357,1.9578,2.2435,0.0224,0.0686,0.018,3.7126,3.6091,4.5693,0.5874,1.0697,0.4234,0.0002,5.0576,1.8837,1.5165,0.5037,0.0691,0.478,2.0813,8.9928,5.0263,3.3397,0.4325,4.5109,2.4781,0.001,0.001,0.1154,6.5252,3.4735,4.6324,5.0439,0.0004,0.0001,0.0585,1.5387,3.7945,2.1202,0.8516,0.1468,0.7039,0.0002,0.0006,0.0011,0.245,1.9924,0.6507,3.003,0.4027,0.1097,0.7155,0.5032,0.1901,0.3486,0.0041,0.0517]}
{"id":1578,"ended":true,"length":527,"text":"A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on June 25 and moved across the Atlantic Ocean and central Caribbean Sea with little development. Within the western Caribbean Sea, convection developed with powerful waves that became known as \"Tropical Storms\" and hit the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean while approaching the South America Island in southwestern Colombia, the Caribbean Sea and Africa. It was located at 1,400 kilometres west-southeast of the city of Santa Fe.\nFossil models show the hurricane was centered in the Indian Ocean.\nThe official tropical-storm watch on the Suez Canal was later extended until Wednesday morning, and the waters around the Suez Canal had been cleared from all of their traffic.\nTropical Storms were a relatively rare occurrence on the Pacific Ocean. In the 1980s, three other tropical-storm-strength waves formed in the tropical Atlantic while the Atlantic remained mostly dry due to low pressure.\nSome of the most recent hurricanes and tropical-storm warnings have come from the U.S., with more than 100 storms recorded by NOAA since 1975.\n\"What we have been seeing is a fairly steady flow of heavy rains and thunderstorms and tropical storm warnings,\" said Dr. John H. Campbell, a hurricane researcher at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Los Angeles.\nIn addition to Tropical Storm Warning warnings, NOAA issued a tropical storm warning for the Pacific Ocean, South America and Atlantic Ocean and included Tropical Storm Warning for Northern Caribbean Sea and Caribbean Sea and Caribbean Sea for the Mediterranean Sea.\nIt was also expected to cause significant rainfall and flooding that could lead to severe thunderstorms along the coastlines of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Bahamas, the Virgin Islands and the Panamanian Islands. They also posed significant hazard for boats and boats leaving the U.S. to land on the coast of Mexico.\n\"I would say that about 80 per cent of the Pacific coastlines in the U.S. can see the tropical storm warning now,\" said Hosea Williams, a NOAA forecaster. He said tropical-storm warnings could extend up to 15 days in the next 24 hours.\nBy Wednesday afternoon, a little less than five per cent of the Pacific coast was under a tropical cyclone warning, meaning that it would be time to leave the storm warning area.\nThe storm moved north-northeast towards the Caribbean Ocean, and a tropical depression was located about 120 kilometres southwest of the center of tropical-storm warnings. It was tracking north-northeast for a further 2.5 hours and was located about 1,650 kilometres north-northeast of the center of the tropical-storm warnings.\n\"If the tropical-storm warning is extended, it will trigger a tropical storm warning in Puerto Rico,\" said Campbell. \"That's how a lot of the storms in the United States are getting into the Atlantic this evening.\"\nCopyright 2020 NPR.

{"id":3633,"ended":true,"length":549,"text":"The site of Ashdod in the Bronze Age and Iron Ages was at a tell just south of the modern city. It was excavated by archaeologists in nine seasons between 1962 and 1972.\n\nThe sites are located between the south bank of the Yamil River and the Yamil River and are part of a long-hidden underground complex called Anzor. As the site is only about 10km (6 miles) from the city of Ashdod (which lies roughly 2km west of the city), it is likely that there was a very special relationship between these sources of supply and distribution for the supply of iron and later later Iron Age tools. The source of iron is from the ruins of an ancient mine located on the outskirts of Ashdod where Ashdod was a relatively prosperous town. The mine was opened by the Germans in 1894 as a way to improve its mining ability. Most iron produced from the mine comes from China, though more than 90percent of the iron is exported by China because of the country's high economic output.\n\nOn 25 July 1966, archaeologists found an underground mine known as Anzor with a shaft leading through the ground using a technique known as \u201cdouble helix compression\u201d. At the time, there were no other iron ore dumps in Ashdod. The underground mine is still standing and as part of excavation work it has been located.\n\nAt the time of excavating the mine there were only 100 Iron Age tools being found in the mines and they were still being used today. All the tools were hand carved onto a stone plate. Since the mines were completely sealed and exposed at all-day, they served no purpose. However, since the mine is in a very low level of the Yamil River, excavating the mine will only be able to find tools that were previously hidden in the river below.\n\nThe mine was found to have a shaft leading through the ground about 20km (14 miles) south of Ashdod\u2019s city center. It was then placed under excavation and then again under excavation in 1960. At the time, there were only 3 iron ore dumps in Ashdod. The excavation works are still on-going to find further iron ore.\n\nThe excavation works at the mine will not only be able to find tools that would be hidden in the river below, but also tools that were previously hidden in the Yamil River at various locations in the city.\n\nAll the tools left at the mine will now be taken after they are discovered and shipped to the world\u2019s most sophisticated iron crusher where they will be produced in the largest single-stage mill.

the word Allah is the \"father\" of all beings.\"\nThis is how one learns to read the Quran: \"Take a look at the words of Allah, you will see the same way as the other words in this world of which Allah is the father and all of his sons are Muslims.\"","token_len":617,"entropy":[9.3506,9.7777,1.1694,1.5844,8.5388,10.6408,7.1703,0.7548,4.1965,8.3343,0.2255,1.6896,7.1288,13.313,7.1792,4.7666,5.7642,9.1935,0.0752,1.3878,8.3812,8.0285,2.3142,0.4156,1.2996,3.9714,0.7738,5.3947,0.1097,2.8038,0.6328,5.097,1.0609,0.8858,0.287,1.9565,0.7863,0.0014,6.8259,4.3882,0.0007,0.2767,0.0015,0.0002,0.0012,4.2927,4.044,4.4184,4.0663,4.4806,3.5737,4.6307,3.6553,4.154,4.3747,0.8788,4.9904,5.6645,0.932,3.1129,0.0328,1.4936,8.195,0.0903,0.1675,2.4073,3.3358,0.0002,12.347,0.1442,15.9348,0.0056,1.6368,4.3253,0.3562,0.6707,1.1466,2.1061,0.8016,5.6232,0.2479,0.6517,4.7016,1.388,0.8182,3.5264,2.2406,6.2523,5.0426,3.114,3.3762,2.5189,2.049,2.9049,5.6379,3.4137,1.838,4.5047,4.8186,3.5882,0.6079,6.1881,1.927,2.1834,2.5169,1.5938,1.019,2.3686,5.3354,5.4392,3.5652,3.3401,1.7917,1.5999,0.3192,3.8764,0.7288,0.6412,4.403,4.0292,4.5522,3.6882,3.4599,1.9247,1.0366,4.4624,0.8761,0.892,1.0584,3.9116,5.4104,2.3898,4.2357,1.3037,1.1233,2.5384,4.0241,1.0235,0.6147,0.5698,2.8829,1.4242,0.1006,2.0843,7.728,1.7651,3.0531,0.3567,6.372,0.3218,3.7923,1.444,3.7935,5.7872,6.2128,1.2709,0.0064,3.5184,3.9026,7.6722,2.6464,1.1443,2.7811,0.3004,4.0082,1.4227,3.6124,1.8675,0.7527,0.6711,2.1353,1.5037,5.0438,5.1488,0.5168,2.1498,1.517,5.1749,3.6845,3.1826,1.2649,1.8261,3.4576,8.9324,1.157,1.0478,1.868,0.5494,3.2308,3.9031,5.1939,6.023,0.8222,0.9924,1.2296,4.8586,2.6731,0.0981,2.3323,4.6481,2.6139,4.927,1.1438,5.0695,5.8278,2.0209,2.1196,7.7158,2.5277,0.2809,1.6059,5.5858,3.9692,1.4369,2.8697,1.7491,2.8107,3.1397,0.6711,4.6631,2.1453,3.4099,4.6111,0.3482,0.039,6.2524,3.3071,7.1843,3.3865,0.1673,4.029,6.0033,1.6276,7.0447,3.6314,0.0253,1.9459,3.4179,1.4245,2.4873,1.5485,3.0057,4.9627,2.9735,0.8774,2.8372,1.7561,4.9352,3.9017,2.5115,1.3152,1.2068,5.7812,0.3867,6.5209,4.1096,5.4475,3.4767,4.9785,1.6976,2.1781,5.1133,0.3831,1.2838,0.4644,3.7761,1.9047,4.6944,0.9756,6.6769,5.1253,5.9604,2.387,0.0559,3.9046,4.459,1.4248,2.0743,2.6009,0.7118,1.2009,5.527,1.9201,1.3677,0.4209,0.2554,2.1586,3.7029,6.1446,1.0922,0.5793,5.3699,4.6959,2.3908,2.9572,1.6161,2.976,3.6094,2.7934,4.3288,6.7928,1.0278,0.8184,4.2725,3.6092,3.0748,2.2194,1.1194,4.4396,0.9986,3.7221,4.7248,1.6548,0.2059,4.8084,4.7876,3.2344,0.8549,4.8703,3.7342,3.1308,6.3243,2.4138,2.9056,1.2931,0.7269,1.1442,1.9297,0.4795,0.5952,0.6169,5.4061,0.9087,2.2748,0.0331,0.0847,4.3062,7.4669,0.2531,0.2646,0.2466,0.203,1.3938,3.3839,2.4031,0.7797,6.3053,0.0082,1.4218,2.7565,0.7952,1.2968,0.4957,3.7273,5.7749,2.6489,0.8685,1.0344,0.0139,4.7133,0.0183,1.5022,4.9229,4.5723,5.13,0.9929,0.5496,2.0814,1.4104,5.3941,1.3266,0.186,4.3818,0.5983,0.1974,0.8831,1.843,4.3948,2.3309,2.3073,5.1806,4.0627,1.0485,0.2927,3.6498,0.0308,4.9556,5.4458,3.5455,1.6833,3.2168,0.4671,0.8399,4.1139,5.848,1.3867,0.2591,8.1318,2.3945,3.1151,2.4482,0.9994,0.3007,7.3087,0.5918,3.953,5.2383,1.2017,0.7507,0.2869,7.1671,0.6007,1.026,4.2676,0.4553,0.7779,2.9382,2.4812,0.4781,1.7983,0.6903,3.123,1.9353,2.5913,2.6414,0.3518,0.196,0.7487,1.3565,0.7443,2.3591,1.1386,2.8633,0.7981,4.2706,2.5251,5.1468,3.2908,1.8306,2.369,0.2155,6.6201,3.8756,5.8475,1.1246,0.6591,2.0773,0.1633,3.2815,0.0343,3.104,0.6286,3.4833,0.0763,0.4235,0.0862,1.3651,2.468,2.3377,0.9153,5.0749,0.1504,1.7448,3.486,1.2574,1.0614,6.8069,0.0503,3.101,1.1667,3.5778,1.8413,0.2425,4.3136,2.1302,3.6669,2.5452,2.5557,4.7223,3.3397,3.9518,0.6652,4.5708,3.8201,3.6598,1.0087,0.8834,0.3529,3.044,3.61,0.8565,0.1326,1.5335,7.2336,3.6146,2.7433,8.5431,0.9657,0.835,3.9555,0.2868,2.2271,1.261,0.8576,0.5777,0.1777,2.5407,4.0708,4.1009,2.6082,3.8367,1.4463,1.5737,0.2302,2.2401,4.5763,5.5585,3.4644,4.6046,4.22,1.1655,5.4893,2.2705,1.7169,5.7792,3.1494,0.0127,4.0078,2.8791,5.0087,0.553,1.1129,1.9387,2.9453,1.6631,0.8068,0.0011,0.001,0.1932,0.1957,1.7155,2.8506,5.4361,2.6527,0.0548,1.329,1.3671,0.2669,1.4891,0.5991,1.4525,1.6667,0.1959,0.072,0.1002,4.5721,2.6196,4.3418,0.7059,0.922,2.7686,5.3733,0.998,1.9119,0.5222,0.1221,0.5296,2.0265,0.2326,3.6904,1.0128,3.5017,5.0667,6.3643,1.8367,2.7292,0.3375,0.2919,1.1129,2.957,7.2662,3.7209,1.7148,0.2917,0.6518,3.0273,0.7034,1.2469,1.6118,3.5661,0.4487,1.0842,2.6172,3.3649,3.7584,2.128,2.0569,4.0682,3.8313,2.6924,3.5811,3.7152,3.3664,6.5198,2.7243,0.7427,0.5699,1.4545,2.1539,3.9126,3.3547,3.7031,3.9788,1.3213,6.4508,1.3451]}

The Boazs will be disappointed because they could see their first winning streak of the year.","token_len":618,"entropy":[8.0278,4.9961,1.7389,5.5455,12.4967,5.9149,8.3421,2.264,5.2632,0.5225,2.2488,0.9136,9.1048,5.9946,7.8272,0.2083,8.2599,1.9045,0.0919,2.2845,1.1497,0.6014,4.5239,0.8298,2.5918,1.1886,3.906,5.3228,5.6304,7.8579,6.7504,6.6747,0.2107,6.3992,0.2294,2.1677,2.6456,3.7489,4.7525,7.1069,0.1271,0.0247,5.1445,1.0278,2.0647,2.8787,4.3999,1.5649,1.67,1.8897,1.3375,4.3889,0.8248,2.618,5.1422,3.557,2.2587,3.7198,0.0834,2.8145,6.4227,0.1132,2.6002,1.084,5.5438,0.1616,1.325,2.036,4.6716,2.1276,4.1794,9.677,8.8704,5.3848,4.1123,6.3346,5.4618,6.187,0.5226,5.1379,3.5518,4.2824,9.6416,0.9195,0.0013,3.2651,2.7603,0.0033,5.2912,0.3145,2.3014,0.0075,6.3021,3.8159,5.1709,2.0986,5.299,3.8017,4.5184,0.914,0.4669,1.9633,4.8787,1.2212,0.0412,6.1886,2.7298,3.3106,1.1114,3.2453,0.802,0.6273,1.6412,0.0075,3.8889,2.6636,3.8257,2.6472,2.1402,5.6373,4.0862,0.0744,0.8869,4.0364,3.6018,0.6495,6.2536,0.4927,3.1065,4.3631,4.0281,0.0082,4.7367,5.8703,4.6859,1.7021,0.009,0.9561,1.4124,1.9006,6.2932,3.4576,5.2572,1.0418,4.8743,0.9817,5.53,2.3116,2.0209,4.1753,6.3234,1.8161,1.8311,5.536,1.4591,0.7416,0.0002,4.8909,0.0005,0.0073,2.3924,4.0013,3.7395,3.3171,3.2557,3.6586,0.1944,4.1957,4.2764,3.689,2.7594,1.8665,2.1775,5.0846,0.0028,0.9896,1.6113,0.0119,1.6791,1.214,3.3548,2.5027,2.2696,5.4065,2.4007,1.5211,0.785,0.6816,1.4076,2.8039,1.1377,4.7517,0.9965,3.2905,2.5455,4.264,0.67,2.1126,0.0002,4.4281,0.0007,0.0054,2.9632,1.4462,0.9978,5.2878,4.5056,1.4237,1.4747,0.4142,2.5939,2.5325,1.4011,1.7655,4.6336,6.6351,2.9532,3.1109,1.0521,1.9431,3.6167,3.0353,0.5914,2.8423,1.9814,0.5292,4.3456,4.1046,0.5936,0.2813,0.5319,0.4202,2.7508,4.4107,3.2074,0.0014,5.2438,0.4819,4.974,8.4632,1.3983,0.7236,0.6724,1.6213,0.0011,2.9616,4.0845,0.0106,0.7285,3.4241,2.4833,1.7413,3.4595,4.62,4.4112,1.3476,3.1733,5.8667,1.4234,1.6129,2.3008,1.3099,1.8981,5.1419,2.1928,1.9338,0.977,0.0032,4.2026,0.1831,3.0566,1.4439,0.5707,1.4258,0.9276,0.7972,2.0784,0.0017,2.0791,4.5187,1.6079,0.0964,5.1396,4.0938,0.8756,2.89,0.077,1.8088,5.0286,3.8505,5.0898,2.6382,1.1372,1.6563,1.7265,5.0447,4.5365,4.3239,0.4896,0.4914,0.0002,0.914,0.0009,0.4303,0.0014,1.262,0.9031,1.9155,5.2176,0.584,0.9356,0.1699,6.0098,0.5715,1.7573,3.1093,1.2393,5.6209,4.3566,2.8138,0.6412,0.0741,1.0839,0.9726,0.6107,0.001,3.2753,4.4734,0.2067,0.3835,0.0513,1.5848,0.3963,0.8141,0.8562,0.2527,0.3025,0.0308,2.1805,0.1573,0.0087,0.1074,0.0788,2.8224,0.0002,1.7706,0.0011,0.2199,0.0009,2.7688,2.9301,1.8422,1.6192,1.2678,2.3462,2.4626,0.727,0.1492,2.7551,0.7935,1.2545,6.2748,3.8529,4.9014,2.1782,6.1315,5.2545,5.5894,0.3498,2.2879,0.234,0.3803,0.4003,1.247,3.2521,6.7665,0.868,1.4067,1.6732,4.1658,3.2495,3.8514,2.2928,2.1275,3.5865,3.7883,1.9645,3.7657,1.2938,2.2844,1.7571,1.851,2.594,0.914,0.1828,0.5019,0.0412,0.034,2.0252,0.4202,1.5815,0.0002,7.014,7.7543,2.8814,7.1305,2.0968,3.145,2.9578,5.0573,1.8224,1.4687,2.4951,4.4505,0.643,0.1655,3.1638,1.4832,0.2457,0.0854,3.8927,2.5322,2.902,0.0551,0.1781,2.7952,1.089,0.613,7.3182,6.4293,0.2823,4.2697,6.1109,0.041,2.8552,2.6928,1.4139,5.1464,4.3441,2.468,1.0656,2.7751,1.8988,5.5937,0.3558,1.4353,3.6679,1.7265,4.5907,0.6788,5.081,5.5699,3.3148,0.0047,0.4148,3.2349,5.7472,0.5883,5.3923,0.4209,1.9123,1.743,4.0156,0.8865,4.1092,0.8477,0.8092,0.0003,6.9585,0.0013,0.0028,1.5353,0.8636,2.244,2.8925,2.3956,0.0003,1.6341,3.584,4.3476,3.4964,0.4641,1.8996,0.4877,0.9769,0.1699,1.0757,0.0401,2.1222,1.919,1.6808,0.5004,2.7653,4.1587,3.6803,4.7613,2.9475,0.8941,2.049,0.0003,4.0438,0.0008,0.0034,1.2916,5.6337,2.0502,4.0988,1.3097,3.5146,2.3703,3.4181,1.662,2.1918,0.9672,0.0184,9.3668,2.4587,5.8745,0.5523,1.5575,0.0003,2.8287,0.0009,0.0044,1.3443,2.1278,0.0976,3.9867,0.001,0.4948,2.5994,0.9794,2.5838,1.6162,2.707,1.8794,4.2437,2.2359,0.4563,1.5944,4.0472,10.679,3.8504,2.3261,1.1302,1.7977,0.4638,1.552,0.5817,0.8815,0.0003,1.1886,0.0013,0.0055,0.8855,0.7394,0.0614,2.2127,0.1172,0.8611,0.5077,4.6562,0.0305,1.3947,2.1815,1.3604,1.2113,0.7344,0.508,0.0175,2.5243,5.3344,4.7515,0.0561,0.0009,0.5771,3.3881,2.4842,2.2751,1.0834,2.2948,0.5809,0.6038,0.0188,0.7313,6.1458,2.8035,1.6095,2.5909,1.4183,0.7381,1.1654,1.0434,0.0052,1.0551,3.9158,1.3271,0.4322,3.071,0.3468,0.0975,0.0181,4.1332,1.8111,6.6224,4.9825,1.3541,5.0811,6.2412,2.1748,3.1886,3.8194,2.0125,1.7361,0.1956,2.8805,2.0732]}
{"id":3760,"ended":true,"length":575,"text":"After news of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached the Indies in early August 1945, followed by the proclamation of Indonesian independence on 17 August, it was evident that Japanese control over the area on the other side of the Sumatra Sea was a major concern. The island country became an international community, while Indonesia was subject to an international treaty on human rights.\n\nAfter the war, the islands did not see any official action on the part of the US or US military. Japan did not even talk to the Indian government, but instead provided support.\n\nThe island countries suffered extreme economic and social problems and was heavily affected by civil war. In turn, the islands also suffered from the extreme economic problems due to the constant use of nuclear weapons in Korea and Japan.\n\nLater on, as Indonesia rose to become a powerful power in the region and its military might was gradually depleted, it became a major power in the world.\n\nAs a result of the disaster, the islands and its inhabitants became in need of military support, which would have been more than enough. The Indonesian army was destroyed during World War II, and in 1944 the country was liberated.\n\nToday Indonesian government has not yet fully understood the extent and consequences of the disaster, as it still suffers from the consequences of war.\n\nKorea was one of many countries which suffered under the impact of the war. It is important to note that the Indonesian government was under a huge struggle with the Japanese and its military aggression until after the war ended. Since 1991 this has been the only country to suffer under US military involvement.\n\nA total of 454 million Indonesians have fled to the US by sea or land.\n\nIn early August 1945 the US air force and the navy was in a serious war situation on the island of Indonesia. It was this air force which suffered the most severe damage during the war, as well as the biggest loss of life.\n\nThe US and the Indonesian navy was also engaged with the Japanese for the first time in the fight against the Japanese.\n\nIn mid June 1945 the US and the Indonesian navy agreed upon a new agreement that allowed in the possession of Indonesian prisoners as well as the release of Japanese prisoners during the invasion of the island.\n\nAs a result of the cooperation, in mid July, and early August 1945 the Indonesian submarine VMSK was deployed to send American forces to the island at the start of a week of fighting.\n\nIn August 1945 the Indonesian navy made a decision after almost a month that its fleet of VMSKs could be transferred to the United States.\n\nAfter the Indonesian victory on August 18, 1945, President Mahinda Siang announced the plan to withdraw the Indonesian fleet from the island, which will end up making the island another hotspot for Japanese

forming the most powerful power in the area.","token_len":618,"entropy":[7.6704,0.5588,1.0442,10.4525,2.6258,2.3208,0.1707,0.0717,0.0002,0.0003,3.3431,1.5773,14.1302,1.78,4.5206,2.7405,0.7707,0.1367,8.9509,0.2261,0.9833,8.709,0.4572,11.3518,0.9229,1.8304,3.9154,0.6404,0.648,3.4738,0.6451,5.8602,0.2503,4.8526,5.1054,1.6514,0.6222,4.1768,6.2857,1.2249,4.11,0.231,0.1438,0.1026,8.696,0.0297,1.7302,0.9638,3.894,2.5115,2.8886,0.6049,1.954,4.4775,5.7883,4.6565,2.5487,3.8194,5.9305,3.8289,4.9113,3.0169,1.4864,5.4016,0.0586,3.8197,1.0517,2.0581,3.0711,3.661,0.0211,0.8255,1.5258,0.005,3.9517,0.8036,2.1058,0.4372,1.2377,3.6953,6.3517,0.4421,5.0747,1.8419,4.5007,4.123,2.4442,0.886,2.4052,0.0008,0.7531,3.7369,2.431,4.4221,3.6553,1.2562,4.24,3.4312,0.9255,4.3915,5.996,1.4115,0.5754,5.807,0.8588,2.5816,3.0372,3.749,4.6126,3.7103,3.3029,2.5297,0.0002,1.895,3.3783,3.7662,6.3328,6.5678,1.9338,1.8602,1.7829,1.7461,2.8954,5.6467,4.4259,1.6137,0.1017,5.0247,0.9892,0.8224,2.4857,7.1777,0.0617,0.8606,2.7171,3.5084,1.226,1.2171,1.8728,6.3252,2.8813,3.2958,5.0337,0.0374,0.9451,6.1826,4.3489,0.0486,4.3085,0.3718,3.4322,5.1329,1.1894,2.0185,0.4733,1.0513,0.0002,6.9629,1.3839,0.5973,4.1012,5.4764,5.8902,1.357,2.9999,0.7218,3.5152,1.8836,1.5726,0.7721,1.1461,2.3887,4.2858,2.8736,5.377,2.138,4.307,4.127,0.3143,2.3497,1.3463,2.0314,1.9139,3.198,0.7299,0.6437,3.5905,0.5411,1.3529,0.0002,4.038,1.5461,0.4402,0.845,0.8817,6.1729,1.2858,0.967,1.8847,4.0199,3.1154,3.2358,2.5351,5.3219,2.476,0.0238,4.646,2.4392,2.223,2.6509,4.1327,1.6891,1.3723,4.2686,2.0512,2.2716,2.8735,2.073,4.503,3.9872,1.8528,6.091,2.7105,3.3611,0.0018,0.1146,0.9227,1.057,2.8668,3.5724,1.4828,3.3675,1.2984,5.1408,2.3377,0.7368,0.0002,4.2318,6.8667,2.7542,2.2263,4.2278,3.2758,2.4904,4.113,0.5699,3.8182,3.1601,3.3329,0.0121,0.4087,2.2926,1.4028,3.2638,1.7272,3.7213,5.1921,0.2311,1.5035,4.6055,0.1921,3.1958,0.9029,1.6491,0.0002,5.4679,2.5617,3.2379,3.2464,0.0436,3.7583,1.1442,2.6502,1.4432,5.2711,0.387,5.4191,0.014,0.4226,1.4845,0.7838,2.4314,2.1781,3.7425,0.1094,0.8316,0.1472,1.2735,5.1506,0.5338,2.0713,4.7291,3.1166,4.4688,6.7881,1.4096,0.6024,2.2606,3.0405,3.9444,2.3618,6.5166,6.086,4.2612,0.3512,0.7011,1.4443,0.4744,4.6605,5.7084,5.3287,1.5142,1.1443,1.1187,3.8136,0.649,2.1185,2.8795,3.0074,4.9582,1.9425,4.587,0.6595,0.4776,0.0002,4.2496,4.51,0.0937,3.7655,4.8952,3.2836,3.2665,0.0009,1.7103,2.2353,1.2845,1.263,1.4101,5.3646,1.4844,2.8067,1.3226,1.5225,1.7448,0.0002,2.7205,5.891,3.078,1.544,2.4033,1.477,5.2019,0.339,4.2,1.4349,3.5071,5.5538,3.8147,2.3962,4.8131,4.0583,2.3537,4.6801,0.4153,1.9649,0.3868,6.5765,0.4593,3.5567,0.7422,5.4322,3.4165,0.1866,1.1312,5.2158,0.6291,0.8837,3.0964,2.7646,2.3835,0.1838,0.7659,1.7258,2.0448,3.0536,0.0055,0.986,5.616,2.12,0.4082,0.3175,1.1089,0.7233,0.0001,1.6336,1.4292,3.5443,2.048,2.7746,2.3212,4.3336,3.1827,4.2224,5.1478,0.6952,1.3522,4.9112,1.9309,0.7236,0.0295,1.0575,1.5748,4.9114,0.4251,0.3574,1.4292,1.3292,1.6959,0.0001,2.1059,4.3506,4.8613,0.4774,1.3113,0.8875,2.148,0.9969,0.9286,0.6146,6.682,3.8229,0.5355,2.6873,3.6588,2.8906,3.9578,7.1286,1.8183,6.723,0.0661,5.7498,5.9626,5.9507,0.8255,0.0092,2.0215,2.859,0.0471,1.8265,0.754,4.7244,0.5547,6.187,0.4368,1.507,1.8082,1.2666,0.598,0.0002,4.0011,1.2083,0.1831,0.2573,0.8177,6.2315,0.971,3.9985,2.6729,2.3152,2.9405,5.4634,3.8461,0.0362,1.8171,1.2227,2.1321,7.9636,6.9035,7.0677,6.2912,2.2649,4.2473,0.5777,8.1522,4.7106,3.9942,0.7076,0.8495,1.1601,5.6502,1.3144,3.684,0.0049,3.4463,5.8321,1.8417,3.0519,0.5992,0.6824,0.0001,1.7329,2.6963,1.0246,0.8552,2.7925,1.6785,4.7595,1.1935,4.3805,6.2951,5.9064,1.7372,1.1371,2.714,4.2761,4.0907,3.003,4.7605,0.1243,0.0266,2.7603,3.0734,1.7909,3.4335,0.3092,0.5729,3.3837,0.0445,0.9669,0.9424,0.0001,3.5594,1.2042,5.4292,6.8221,2.8715,1.6132,3.9591,0.4081,2.1419,0.4829,4.8779,5.1898,0.1808,4.6245,5.9855,3.8673,1.4417,5.2286,0.7026,4.3384,1.0824,3.7996,2.6749,0.7157,0.2486,1.3058,2.4786,1.9513,5.7686,5.4565,1.727,5.5215,1.0869,0.959,6.6315,5.9853,0.0067,0.2356,1.8752,4.6366,3.5981,0.2758,0.2734,0.0001,1.7425,3.413,3.0517,2.3075,1.9415,3.861,2.917,4.0418,0.8998,0.1455,0.0316,1.1532,6.6542,1.7882,1.1942,6.8036,0.6603,1.9763,4.3167,3.8568,2.3673,3.8558,3.0226,2.42,5.8744,0.023,2.9375,5.7713,2.6912,2.3348,0.6364,3.373,0.6871,5.6242,0.6829,4.0075,2.0924,4.6205,0.2458,0.1723,4.3628,0.2312]}
{"id":1875,"ended":true,"length":601,"text":"The New Zealand Brigade commander had been taken ill, so Birdwood appointed Brigadier @ - @ General Harold Walker, a staff officer already ashore, as commander. The Auckland Battalion had landed in the Western Reserve in early 1943, but they were forced to stay home by an illness, and were eventually brought ashore, along with a small number of other local troops ashore, the night before their journey. It was there that they found Commander Walker with the courage to rescue the brigade. The New Zealand Brigade arrived at Dunedin at 6 p.m., where they set up a fort and were to be kept on and watch along with the rest of the New Zealand troops, only to be informed only a few hours later by the Auckland battalion that the British soldiers had landed in Dunedin.\n\nThe New Zealand Brigade was not only attacked but occupied by the New Zealand forces on its way to Dunedin. The garrison consisted of the Wellington forces, New Zealand Garrison and the Wellington National Defence Forces. The garrison held positions that would later become known as New Zealand Bases and were heavily guarded. The New Zealand garrison would later be occupied by the forces of the Netherlands Army and the British Army. A series of attacks, some of which were sustained by the New Zealand garrison, took place in February 1945.\n\nThe New Zealand Brigade was the largest force in history in terms of number of men (12,714). It would have been the largest force in the Western Reserve, and one of the largest of its kind in history. The New Zealand Brigade was also one of the largest armies of the 21st Century. It had to be fought at home, and therefore the New Zealand Brigade served in large volumes. With the strength of these troops it was highly likely the New Zealand Brigade would have been the largest force in this area at first, and that too in numbers, while still maintaining some of the force\u2019s strong support.\n\nThe New Zealand Brigade would have helped the New Zealand Brigade with their ability to keep up with the Allied forces at war. It would have aided the New Zealand Brigade in keeping the Japanese forces at bay, and even keeping the Japanese forces at bay. The New Zealand Brigade would have made it far easier to hold down the Japanese forces during the fight, while still maintaining some of the strength and stability it would achieve during wars. While many of the New Zealand troops had already made it through these wars with their strength and support intact, they would still have come back and become part of a force that would continue to be part of any fight that had come before in a century. The New Zealand Brigade would have been one of the largest forces in the Western Reserve, and indeed the largest. In the end, the New Zealand Brigade would have been the largest British forces ever produced. In comparison with the other British forces it was extremely difficult to find a strong force to fight a prolonged war, which was an extremely difficult task. Nevertheless the New Zealand Brigade was very strong in this area of the war and helped put the war into a very practical state of affairs.","token_len":618,"entropy":[6.5893,4.5009,8.1011,6.8173,5.6535,1.8607,5.4788,4.7598,2.3025,3.9266,11.797,5.8999,8.566,6.8199,0.0358,10.884,9.7139,2.881,7.8754,8.3587,5.228,2.5606,3.6862,5.5146,2.1733,8.5541,9.9069,2.4204,2.0824,3.4109,1.5728,2.8227,6.9805,3.6305,3.2346,6.3232,2.1028,2.2102,6.0255,4.2926,3.1983,3.5693,5.4101,1.3275,2.4543,3.8055,0.8577,4.1947,0.1705,4.4006,4.9906,4.615,4.3852,5.6572,2.3914,1.1725,2.2259,4.8254,4.9264,1.4363,3.6469,3.7137,0.0124,2.2509,3.2668,1.3656,0.0014,2.2303,4.3032,1.7731,8.3437,1.7286,5.0803,4.2417,0.4287,2.857,6.6408,1.4712,3.9072,0.4425,3.6912,0.3957,2.0071,3.0427,7.0476,2.5618,4.168,1.8274,6.5933,0.6238,4.9795,1.7694,5.3924,2.0874,2.3636,3.3205,0.04,0.3898,5.2405,1.1603,5.2856,0.1222,2.8829,2.861,4.0221,0.0006,0.0004,1.1456,3.8422,0.9209,4.4134,1.6722,1.9551,5.576,2.8294,3.2495,5.498,1.8226,5.3883,3.0347,5.8163,4.7676,6.2228,2.3485,1.0067,1.4648,0.0443,0.095,1.8773,0.0046,3.6132,2.6401,5.8827,0.7627,0.5537,4.7464,5.6337,2.1111,0.4679,0.531,0.1057,1.9584,1.7839,3.6911,3.2791,1.7338,1.7872,3.6585,4.6529,0.7454,3.816,1.8591,1.2829,0.0002,0.732,2.5401,0.104,1.9264,1.4655,0.0097,0.3887,1.8335,3.7244,2.7098,4.8475,3.525,6.2163,1.4355,1.2067,2.3823,0.1054,4.4719,3.0907,4.19,0.4038,0.4619,1.2648,0.0005,0.7644,1.6806,6.1341,4.6449,0.1476,3.1113,2.6903,6.4677,0.5918,3.6318,0.0877,8.3857,1.991,1.3234,1.7506,5.4971,3.5935,3.2198,0.6917,1.272,3.8882,4.9432,5.6422,5.5718,3.1087,2.6477,1.3956,1.0951,0.0244,4.914,0.5035,5.5225,2.3184,2.4429,2.5132,5.4048,2.107,1.4837,1.4789,1.2392,0.0072,5.5716,4.5483,2.1328,0.8538,4.7388,0.1244,0.3517,6.2247,0.2743,0.4716,6.921,3.2015,1.5653,1.0918,2.1086,1.2809,0.9777,4.3867,4.5412,0.001,3.5442,3.334,3.5617,0.7331,0.4285,0.9948,5.6762,0.9289,0.8172,0.9541,0.0059,4.1955,0.4153,4.4232,0.2102,1.8937,5.1054,2.6544,0.9231,1.475,0.0002,1.5403,1.1146,0.0129,0.4386,1.1426,3.4298,3.2842,2.6969,1.2292,5.5156,3.9598,2.9714,0.0009,1.8352,0.5687,1.809,4.5108,5.0207,0.2545,7.3547,3.2339,1.7028,4.1988,2.7274,0.8369,1.2479,1.4961,1.1977,0.7648,1.1186,3.5126,0.8624,1.879,2.1067,4.6032,0.1135,0.1397,0.8963,3.369,1.4616,0.1417,1.23,1.7558,0.6549,1.51,0.6804,0.006,0.3205,1.1948,2.9039,2.4171,0.0079,0.1571,1.6381,4.8513,1.8018,0.8647,4.7156,0.0535,1.332,0.8796,1.7125,2.0891,4.8463,1.3256,3.146,3.041,3.8848,1.1587,1.4224,5.9197,2.8015,1.1466,0.0036,0.2469,5.2456,2.0969,4.8736,8.9582,1.0707,5.3781,1.3145,5.392,0.3903,4.9344,2.5226,2.491,0.9105,5.5297,1.3361,2.818,0.4457,0.0033,0.2341,0.2587,0.6,1.1522,1.7272,2.0688,0.7169,0.59,4.9906,3.1303,3.7227,6.4742,1.1451,1.6398,3.0332,7.9896,2.832,3.0686,2.1546,6.2965,3.1553,3.1907,3.6014,1.0036,0.5981,5.5678,15.7068,7.5894,4.849,5.3847,4.1613,1.0579,1.0016,0.0002,1.358,0.4932,0.0105,0.1904,3.3394,0.9801,6.4537,1.8129,0.9783,0.0065,1.9393,4.1523,2.3764,5.6777,0.0317,4.6715,1.8819,0.6202,0.5218,4.2883,0.9028,3.3618,5.6631,1.1689,1.6644,1.1172,0.3176,4.9426,1.0307,0.3209,0.0038,0.4087,0.8575,3.2992,1.8987,5.7624,2.7281,1.3341,0.0736,1.2313,0.8551,5.315,8.0371,1.0591,2.1198,1.5431,0.973,0.0223,2.4206,1.7369,0.1746,0.0043,0.1039,0.9281,0.2099,3.8454,2.0614,4.05,0.8865,1.8368,3.6133,3.7766,0.6032,1.2709,0.7746,4.0825,0.6087,5.0362,1.9458,3.5807,2.8587,1.5969,1.3815,0.2032,0.1669,1.3611,2.2657,5.4791,3.5611,2.7072,7.2682,2.2679,7.6414,0.5798,5.0175,4.3466,0.9125,0.3087,0.8338,0.0048,2.1725,3.2467,3.2783,4.2904,0.8363,2.2007,4.9829,4.492,3.8203,2.9565,4.0205,0.9306,3.8975,5.5923,0.1199,2.6674,1.4509,2.8707,0.7223,5.443,2.2862,2.4005,4.6136,2.7543,0.0022,3.2145,2.3346,0.6375,0.8351,2.5863,0.2446,2.4231,2.3341,0.0048,7.066,4.966,2.1095,4.4131,2.1767,0.3308,5.2031,4.3663,4.9221,0.9881,2.4018,0.214,0.0041,0.1322,0.8685,0.441,1.6016,2.9991,0.0458,0.1627,3.2245,1.6931,0.5098,0.9022,0.3822,0.0361,1.2617,0.4768,6.6855,1.7768,0.7062,5.7515,4.1191,2.1745,2.3501,0.5186,1.0806,0.2937,0.0028,0.1108,1.4744,0.6051,0.9913,1.1007,1.7262,6.1751,3.2288,3.0559,7.6984,1.301,4.4446,5.6517,2.2474,0.6026,2.9549,1.7467,0.777,4.8348,1.3287,5.6071,1.2065,0.3855,3.9289,1.9204,4.0665,2.0845,2.0972,1.9489,4.7199,5.6293,0.7041,1.8024,4.109,1.5782,4.1972,2.1766,0.6498,0.3401,0.873,5.2207,2.8606,0.1808,0.0024,0.0899,1.3232,4.0103,2.6825,2.2817,4.2533,0.5287,3.4008,0.7581,4.387,2.4098,5.7051,4.7573,1.2364,4.7228,3.0653,1.4567,2.59,6.5841,4.6276,2.9098,2.1732,0.2597]}
{"id":1844,"ended":false,"length":570,"text":"The influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream create a mild oceanic climate. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging 6 @. @ 5 \u00b0 C ( 43 @. @ 7 \u00b0 C [ ). As the summer months pass, the warmth that prevails in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Stream, will warm again. This time, however, warmer summer temperatures are expected in southern Africa, North America, and Europe.\nThe Arctic Ocean, the southernmost portion of the world, has warmed for a record-breaking 8-year period, and is now at a record-breaking 5\u00b0C and 6\u00b0F ( 1.8 \u00b0C ) in 2017. This year also marks the warmest year on record for the Arctic Ocean, as the average annual temperature was 740 kilometres per annum at the end of 2015.\nThe Arctic has become a leading source of natural gas, with carbonated fuel being exported to the Atlantic Ocean every month, and is currently the world's largest source of methane. The most abundant source of natural gas in the Arctic is from the melting of the Arctic's ice caps, which can kill wildlife and cause sea level rise, or exacerbate dangerous polar weather patterns, like melting glaciers.\nSea level rises and polar weather extremes, like melting ice caps and the release of CO2, result in devastating sea-level rises in the Arctic. The main threat to the Arctic is heat-trapping sea-level rise. Sea levels can rise more than 2 metres (3 feet) by the end of the 20th century, threatening the Arctic. Temperatures in the Arctic are expected to rise by at least 4 and 5-per cent between now and 2045.\nThe rise in temperatures in the southernmost part of the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic Gulf Stream will increase this year, forcing the world's first Arctic national beach to close permanently. The Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream are also the world's most dangerous places for bears and other animals to live in.\nThe Arctic Ocean and the Gulf Stream are also home to a large population of marine predators. During the summer months, they become more likely to be attacked by bears and other species in the wild. In 2020, they were responsible for 35,000 deaths.\nOn Tuesday, February 27, 2021, the European Parliament proposed the new Arctic Climate Agreement and the Joint Economic Committee for the Arctic Ocean (JECO),\" to create an agreement to establish and implement an agreement on CO 2 emission reduction technologies and support for the development of new and energy-efficient modes of transportation, especially for the oil and gas industries.\"\nThe joint climate agreement aims to develop global energy efficiency standards for all goods and services and to limit the growth of greenhouse gas emissions.

{"id":2116,"ended":true,"length":585,"text":"Like the original release, The Secret of Monkey Island : Special Edition received positive reviews from critics. Sean Ely of GamePro praised its updated audio, and said that the new graphics ``are good'' and the new audio is \"like a dream.\" Sean said that \"The special edition has such a strong focus on the story of the characters that there aren't any major surprises in their journey.\" Sean also praised the new soundtrack for those of you who remember the original release. Sean said that the soundtrack for \"Poker Night\" was good, and this version \"is a lot better.\"\n\nOther news\n\nSomewhere along the way, there has been a steady uptick in online gambling in Australia (i.e. the Goldfields). Since August 1 and August 7, players have been able to gain access to more than 1.5 million dollars of money at a time, which is just slightly higher than the $20.2 million in 2009. Even in Australia alone, more than $1.4 billion has been spent on gambling. The reason? Players who don't need extra gambling money can find that extra entertainment with a little bit of luck, or at least that's what everyone thinks and hopes for in Australia. (i.e. in the Goldfields).\n\nTo some people, this is a far cry from what many in the world of gambling have been saying. In fact, gambling is a far more prevalent thing in Australia than any other major country on this planet. While Australia is a small percentage of the population, it is also one of the least developed countries on the planet. For the most part, that doesn't matter, because a large chunk of the population in Australia has simply never used gambling services. In fact, Australia's average daily gambling spend has dropped more than 100% since 1999. It also appears that many in the U.S. are taking a break from playing as well (and getting involved) with other gambling activities. (i.e. gambling is banned in the U.S.)\n\nWhen is it appropriate to accept the news that you might be getting more free money online?\n\nIn November of 2008 the Australian Gaming Regulatory Authority published a rule stating that if an Australian resident is allowed to play, they may participate in any online gambling business in Australia. It's unclear what the rule applies to casinos, but it's clear that betting establishments must pay an Australian tax at least 6 percent of a player's gross income to the Australian Government. This applies to all business of both a casino and a sports ground in a country that can be regarded as legal gambling territory.\n\nIf your bet wins or if you lose and you are unable to play, which you may have won (and the gambling establishment may be unable to profit from) then you may be entitled to a \"tax-free\" refund. This would cover the cost of gambling operations (gambling shops) while the local operator may claim that an Australian resident can only access a casino's sports ground, and pay a tax of 10 percent.","token_len":618,"entropy":[2.6271,5.3024,5.6682,0.7316,5.053,5.5315,1.582,2.2907,0.1482,7.5986,6.1313,0.1142,6.1048,4.8055,0.154,1.8868,1.6746,1.9005,9.4509,11.7863,3.2726,2.4291,6.7946,4.1115,3.8749,8.1402,6.4057,1.4603,2.284,3.4316,1.499,1.3026,2.9784,6.3329,12.1105,2.2522,4.288,4.551,0.8796,2.4697,2.6999,3.2687,1.6907,1.2935,5.3448,1.3596,5.4859,1.8433,5.4198,2.4173,0.6438,3.895,3.1394,7.2218,0.1962,2.943,6.6958,0.5877,3.5123,4.9956,0.1577,1.715,2.0049,3.7161,1.371,3.653,2.1996,3.5853,4.6621,0.0009,1.1379,3.6415,3.9034,2.2829,6.6716,4.3021,0.9449,3.3466,1.9087,2.4554,0.3115,1.7734,2.0877,1.8748,6.8925,3.4404,0.3581,0.2732,5.8279,0.8707,0.6825,2.797,0.8856,1.9494,0.8562,0.3242,1.1,1.4876,2.5457,4.3994,4.615,4.6097,3.2374,1.0494,1.7121,3.6341,0.8697,0.9129,6.7337,3.3407,3.269,2.4773,2.1269,2.3112,1.4725,1.2836,1.8194,0.088,5.4906,5.2383,2.4547,0.0002,5.106,4.9368,0.2639,2.5143,0.0183,0.4555,0.3337,3.9472,4.0787,0.1434,0.8347,7.5517,5.6315,0.1258,4.9889,4.7006,2.9309,4.713,4.3312,5.5366,0.0816,0.0004,0.9722,2.6228,7.8837,7.3762,2.6153,5.3858,4.4893,3.0717,6.5318,1.8953,3.6162,0.5037,4.6151,1.8403,0.9879,0.5676,0.003,5.1482,1.7724,0.0209,3.6754,0.6352,2.8859,2.4491,0.9794,0.3589,3.6011,2.4981,5.1384,3.7576,1.936,0.763,1.9572,2.594,1.1808,4.4478,4.894,3.0193,0.0087,0.6685,2.3577,3.8484,3.2541,4.4497,0.2137,3.2411,7.2928,0.5292,6.0706,3.5198,1.8988,4.4565,0.1133,3.8346,0.1324,2.2876,2.1268,0.5441,2.3016,0.6505,1.1641,0.0806,1.8773,0.5145,1.3399,1.8853,2.3501,5.7633,2.2489,6.075,2.9753,4.2636,0.002,5.381,5.8829,3.7747,1.8344,1.7028,4.4886,5.4671,3.4005,8.8229,3.9343,2.6649,3.3782,2.1911,0.0963,1.8824,2.4533,2.5729,3.3477,0.2452,3.6291,0.4226,0.5372,5.7185,3.0858,5.8991,3.7,1.5149,3.8754,1.6621,0.2156,5.1323,4.9249,0.008,0.0005,0.1259,4.8552,1.5405,3.171,0.036,0.9407,1.0647,0.0003,5.7637,5.7875,3.3078,0.2684,2.1339,1.3501,1.4525,6.7303,0.9535,0.0126,1.9517,4.2293,4.1022,0.6594,3.8177,2.908,1.6181,2.7638,1.1545,3.3026,2.6611,3.1349,1.2028,0.0347,4.047,1.4588,2.3491,3.4506,2.0064,4.3679,5.0172,0.6487,0.5664,0.4901,3.8927,0.145,3.9259,0.9969,2.8205,4.9811,1.1249,0.3755,4.1922,2.934,1.2501,2.3029,4.1853,7.4262,0.0878,0.2303,3.9863,0.5677,1.2462,0.9594,2.5729,2.5325,0.0419,0.1177,3.9934,3.1842,0.8462,0.8976,1.3003,0.194,0.5679,3.9977,2.7329,1.3555,0.0017,0.0691,5.2136,3.4276,0.0006,1.9139,1.9223,1.2247,4.4158,2.1384,3.4151,0.0078,0.773,0.6658,3.7111,0.2467,2.9455,5.6835,2.4363,3.687,1.4119,5.6575,1.0996,2.6445,0.2194,0.0113,3.4152,1.9769,4.3015,2.932,2.5683,2.7343,3.1829,3.1071,4.2904,0.0327,3.9389,0.9934,0.9597,3.5973,0.7289,3.5074,4.1046,4.1911,0.5409,3.5802,3.1561,0.8546,6.4624,0.0008,0.0285,0.2233,1.1339,4.3515,2.2153,3.5639,0.1569,4.5709,5.6367,4.8048,4.0034,3.032,4.3484,5.203,3.2917,2.2542,3.8028,2.1473,2.3008,0.9224,3.5981,0.565,0.0012,0.0009,0.0789,3.2275,2.7001,5.6701,0.4509,1.1798,0.4763,0.0007,0.0031,2.3768,0.7363,0.0002,5.2243,5.6132,1.5717,3.2519,0.3987,6.1473,2.3464,3.629,0.8475,3.5677,3.9205,1.1371,3.6708,3.9133,5.8668,1.634,2.8431,1.4246,1.4458,0.0003,3.4476,5.0115,1.8136,3.5823,4.2967,1.166,4.0066,4.5476,0.4341,3.1524,0.8569,3.2485,2.8738,0.1355,3.4135,3.7587,1.6248,4.1162,1.9947,4.5078,0.1513,2.3968,4.3074,1.6907,3.0312,6.2783,0.244,3.2026,1.8149,0.9328,3.4597,2.8117,0.5046,0.816,3.2576,2.553,3.5323,1.8706,1.8168,1.9986,3.7953,0.1391,4.7871,1.1458,0.686,1.4089,1.735,2.4153,0.169,7.2458,6.6756,4.2025,4.6556,3.7769,1.907,2.7174,5.019,1.4784,6.5906,2.5708,0.5257,3.4834,2.1074,0.0042,2.1249,1.0941,2.3012,1.3347,1.1664,1.894,0.452,2.8563,4.9258,0.4268,2.0913,5.4423,5.3169,5.8758,3.7123,1.1565,0.1255,1.1307,4.9464,8.0885,3.6257,4.8219,1.8318,2.5751,5.4697,2.1112,4.4329,0.0279,6.188,1.041,1.0902,0.2607,1.2296,0.0002,3.1689,3.8366,5.6862,7.9151,3.1866,5.6014,0.7092,1.1136,4.282,0.8558,2.428,2.8872,0.0108,3.7323,1.0192,5.5983,4.1823,2.0228,2.8956,5.5984,4.5722,2.7173,3.8599,3.8968,4.0569,1.4165,2.2035,3.5672,0.0157,6.8143,0.5139,5.5073,1.6344,0.7321,1.2937,0.939,2.8784,0.0108,0.9549,4.5911,3.8409,4.1752,0.1465,0.9417,1.5063,1.6284,1.6474,4.0843,4.185,1.2806,1.9097,0.0603,5.2597,4.8243,2.9009,5.6866,0.0044,6.4086,2.5075,5.4318,1.6643,4.9943,8.0992,2.485,5.0702,2.1345,5.4469,1.4989,1.2061,3.2525,2.909,5.8477,2.2782,2.5218,3.819,6.6016,0.6853,3.2185,1.5683,5.3346,1.8949,1.7987,1.9047,3.0488,0.1626,1.5386]}
{"id":991,"ended":false,"length":562,"text":"A weak disturbance was first observed near Grand Cayman on August 23, gaining tropical storm strength by 0600 UTC that day. Moving towards the north @ - @ northwest, the storm passed quickly into Puerto Rico and was then moving south. Once in Puerto Rico, the hurricane was moving north at about 0,600 UTC while approaching the US mainland. It formed out of the Caribbean Sea around 6:00 AM AEDT on August 24.\nBy the time the storm finally moved into the American mainland, it was located in the Bahamas, approximately 10 km [5 miles] into the Caribbean Sea. The center of the storm was located 3 miles [4 kilometers] northwest of St. Kitts and Nevis and had wind speeds above the midpoint of the storm. The disturbance was moving north as early as 07:30 AM UTC on Sunday, December 16, tracking its current direction at 3 mph with sustained winds of 25 mph.\nAccording to the official data collected by NOAA, Hurricane Gustav is the eighth most powerful hurricane in U.S. history with a total Category 3 stormforce wind gust of 30 mph and winds that reached 65 mph in New Orleans on December 10, and first to hit St. Kitts and Nevis. It is the second the hurricane, as it recorded winds of up to 125 mph in the Atlantic, is approaching Hurricane Sandy as well.\nIn addition to Tropical Storm Hurricane Gustav, Hurricane Andrew was the first Hurricane Michael to move to the West Coast of the United States. Hurricane Andrew left Hurricane Sally behind on August 19 last year, but since then of the storm remained very active with the storm tracking its westward path at 2-3 mph over a 40 km [12-14 mile] perimeter. In the midst of the hurricane, Michael's twin sister, Laura, made landfall on August 24, 2020 and was also the first tropical storm to touch the Atlantic coast.\nHurricane Michael damaged hundreds of houses and damaged about 20.6% of its total damage. One of the worst consequences of the storm was the loss of a large chunk of the Caribbean coast, due to torrentile waves and torrential rains, as well as damaging winds of up to 130 mph which led to widespread water damage in parts of the Caribbean.\nOn September 26, 2020 Maria, one of the most powerful hurricanes in U.S. history, became the biggest storm to ever hit Puerto Rico. It was centered northwest of St. Kitts, and a tropical depression was located about 120 kms [70 meters] south-west of the city of Del Rio. It was still moving north at 2.5 mph and was located 11 km [6 miles] west-southwest of D.C. and about 6 km [3 km] east-southeast of the city of New York City. Maria was the ninth most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico and the sixth most powerful hurricane to have reached the United States mainland.\nEarlier this year, the Bahamas experienced the worst hurricane in the world and the second worst hurricane of all time.\nRelated articles:","token_len":619,"entropy":[10.2103,12.7222,3.5558,5.3008,1.7859,3.9931,7.6414,4.415,0.1424,2.2166,3.5063,3.4907,0.7056,12.1556,8.5298,1.9798,2.9392,4.0337,5.8836,10.7078,3.1335,6.0717,1.6538,0.4222,9.002,4.5457,0.8376,3.4042,9.5521,6.7243,9.9987,7.7402,1.8254,1.2139,2.3083,4.8163,5.9344,3.106,5.0655,0.4584,1.6089,2.5682,3.3848,4.7544,2.7966,2.8372,6.4338,3.4194,0.887,0.0049,0.5516,0.8067,3.0438,1.9891,2.7745,2.5349,1.9382,2.8746,3.3226,6.4689,3.0035,0.0975,5.5243,6.0585,1.0348,3.8902,1.7332,0.7582,3.3188,6.0816,5.5051,0.2841,0.8879,3.6462,0.9693,3.696,4.0405,1.3611,1.4577,1.9904,6.465,2.7813,0.0353,1.9401,0.4261,1.1094,1.213,1.3239,8.8032,1.8181,1.051,1.0447,0.6269,4.9171,2.4556,2.0186,1.102,5.6074,0.8872,0.736,1.0461,0.6654,5.9171,1.9468,0.6477,4.0278,1.8608,5.3815,3.473,2.8528,8.3672,2.5161,1.0861,0.1738,7.3341,0.1884,3.4769,0.3653,0.5709,1.5526,6.0009,0.412,0.205,0.3977,0.5579,1.8939,5.2814,2.9895,2.7082,1.9657,0.8355,0.0421,3.5233,0.0727,5.643,0.217,2.6828,0.0014,0.633,0.0032,0.0001,2.9139,4.7393,5.3195,0.2886,4.2841,3.4478,5.2994,2.5726,0.1465,0.3887,1.0331,0.9452,1.4476,8.31,0.8133,4.6365,2.4093,5.2907,4.7182,0.0083,4.59,1.6175,2.3198,1.6391,2.8671,1.4753,4.6621,0.8745,6.5702,3.5249,1.0427,10.1581,4.5423,4.2389,1.5893,2.4583,4.1382,4.711,4.1068,4.9324,0.4579,0.422,4.2263,1.3936,1.3168,0.8877,5.1289,0.0089,1.2254,5.0917,4.9809,4.9572,0.5672,1.5087,0.6441,3.1668,5.4101,2.4967,1.9033,5.8314,2.5222,0.3265,0.2955,1.2315,2.2875,0.0006,0.0009,0.0366,0.0829,3.1168,0.9794,3.4706,6.4061,2.0148,2.6642,4.9123,6.527,3.1444,0.1788,5.0452,0.5114,2.7712,3.3861,4.944,1.9469,4.5781,0.4085,2.3981,4.2002,1.9522,0.985,1.6367,3.4776,1.0201,4.8892,8.9007,3.0467,1.7604,7.2914,0.0157,1.1883,0.0087,0.5049,0.0019,0.0012,2.7558,2.5804,1.4101,1.3337,2.1008,7.7065,1.6844,4.1024,4.8706,1.6602,5.7421,2.7259,0.7915,3.9332,0.0097,5.1022,0.0644,1.6259,1.7894,2.935,3.2008,5.7493,6.3934,4.5865,4.3604,4.4718,2.0813,0.4661,0.7732,3.2706,1.8268,0.3343,7.4186,0.07,8.4196,2.5283,0.1989,2.1889,3.8819,2.4616,1.3685,2.508,3.9586,9.9285,0.7676,4.2173,3.5324,0.2942,5.1909,0.1936,1.711,0.0825,0.3786,0.0014,1.3907,4.474,1.0557,5.9118,5.2974,9.2334,5.2799,1.4901,1.8038,3.3613,6.9575,0.052,1.346,2.9395,5.6232,0.3771,8.0394,1.5104,4.683,8.7189,5.4985,0.5044,3.121,4.0015,3.5937,5.2211,2.6954,5.3687,1.0553,1.5923,1.879,3.3047,4.9491,0.8831,0.3681,3.6965,4.4292,5.6428,2.9758,0.8336,3.2258,1.7304,1.958,0.8199,0.0119,6.3384,1.1393,3.4478,1.8298,5.0563,0.0043,0.9699,2.3834,1.1479,4.5377,3.8368,9.3853,3.497,0.6475,7.6939,0.355,3.059,0.1861,0.923,0.98,2.3421,1.2394,9.3158,2.6192,1.7617,4.1534,1.7312,1.0043,5.1937,0.3749,0.2936,6.152,0.5292,2.7144,2.2673,0.9082,0.757,3.3888,0.1044,3.6555,9.2884,6.4378,0.0524,4.0855,1.3677,2.3625,4.2898,3.2738,6.4513,2.5853,3.886,0.0171,3.4629,2.0716,2.1333,1.4444,6.2537,1.3045,0.2391,3.413,7.021,0.2174,1.0688,0.5752,0.4545,1.24,1.8405,0.0079,3.3422,3.2036,3.8062,0.003,1.2014,3.7515,1.8124,1.8055,4.9982,0.252,7.3172,14.3268,4.7723,1.8808,4.5974,0.0229,1.1457,2.6594,2.0067,0.2737,0.0073,3.8911,2.4457,2.7419,0.5888,0.0078,4.0588,0.156,5.7128,3.6903,0.0849,3.0744,5.2216,1.6091,2.584,3.0594,0.0024,0.6296,0.8376,0.5408,1.0345,3.4023,1.8653,4.3083,0.2972,6.2931,7.7133,3.6911,4.7127,0.011,0.1759,1.7021,0.1844,0.7164,1.1335,0.6391,0.0005,0.0009,0.0124,0.0154,0.2668,4.64,0.269,6.4144,2.1466,0.7522,2.5682,1.4576,3.2475,0.002,1.0942,1.6625,1.2697,4.6467,6.4059,0.1225,1.9535,0.0147,0.2453,0.0018,2.4365,2.26,5.0246,4.1801,3.8494,1.6337,3.8428,2.7601,5.4555,4.5124,0.2534,1.5612,4.5543,4.9047,0.0582,2.5947,2.3863,1.5494,0.0921,0.8845,2.0972,0.7757,7.4464,2.5384,0.4964,2.1244,0.8103,5.4945,2.081,1.8527,0.7696,3.4939,3.148,1.0766,0.1789,2.7712,1.3726,4.0283,5.0737,0.7207,0.3407,1.7804,0.0905,0.0116,2.8262,3.4487,1.9806,0.2905,0.0417,6.19,2.0631,0.1089,0.1652,3.1116,2.3163,4.1861,0.5557,0.1561,2.0553,7.6582,0.0051,1.7181,0.4235,4.579,0.0037,0.0236,2.0112,1.4289,0.1647,3.4112,0.8424,1.0968,0.1182,3.5072,1.4652,2.5481,4.0796,1.9798,0.0544,0.2107,1.3227,0.7866,1.2739,0.0035,2.4949,2.0442,2.7175,1.1092,0.1653,0.932,0.5344,4.3457,3.4485,0.4038,1.8566,0.002,6.4875,0.9403,0.5657,6.747,1.0955,0.8287,0.3865,2.0583,6.1302,3.2198,1.6976,2.62,1.7001,2.292,2.3478,2.7219,3.1411,1.8792,2.1697,2.4366,0.8637,3.2942,2.0931,0.0771,1.2354,3.2824,5.8277,2.2094,1.3718]}
{"id":4752,"ended":true,"length":571,"text":"Sebastian Vettel's dominant run was derailed in Abu Dhabi when his car was found to have insufficient fuel after qualifying and he was subsequently moved to the back of the grid. As Lewis Hamilton takes charge on the podium next summer, Vettel will be tasked with making an impact, as well as potentially putting his career in a better position.\nIn a race where the world is betting on Ferrari to repeat as champions in 2021, Ferrari did enough to secure the sixth world title for the first time since 2017. It was also the first time the title would make it to a championship-winning team since the Formula One Cup in 1992.\nAfter Ferrari finished third in 2017, Vettel won his second title before winning the second title with team partner Kimi Raikkonen and his fifth in 2020 as teams such as McLaren and Renault struggled for position. The German claimed a second-place finish, becoming just one point behind Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel who has also finished third in the championship.\n\"The last three years in Abu Dhabi have been a really intense journey, going from the moment we found out we were going to lose the championship to the moment we had to make sure that we didn't have to break and to be in the front and in the lead,\" he told CNN Sport.\n\"To be in the front, to be in the back as well I mean you always have an expectation. You always expect something special from you, and this was another example that we could not have expected when we finished seventh after a few hundred races.\n\"We knew that we were going to lose the title and we just needed to make sure that that could not happen, we were desperate to be in the front right from the moment we found out that the championship was going to be won.\"\nFollowing the dramatic turn around in the race that ended in the race's closing seconds when Sebastian Vettel left the track, Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen and his team mate Lewis Hamilton came out to cheer with the support of the race stewards.\n\"Mercedes always does things well, but today we saw that it is something even greater and even better,\" said Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen who also showed support to Vettel during the race's closing seconds.\nSpeaking after the podium finishes, Verstappen and his team-mate Nico Hulkenberg praised the stewards.\n\"Mercedes always has a good track record, that is why they are always there for everyone,\" said the 28-year-old.\n\"I just am a little bitter because every year it has been like that. At that moment, it is just not right and I hate it every day, which is why I am so angry about tonight (Saturday). My mind was not very clear when I came here, but we had a good race and we managed to win the race, which was good.\"\nVettel has the championship this year due to an error by Ralf Ringer and he hopes to see the championship again next summer.","token_len":619,"entropy":[9.6863,0.2203,0.0755,2.2936,0.512,2.7564,6.9767,3.7812,3.4063,6.0449,3.0272,7.6972,0.0,2.2302,2.3197,1.6683,2.4881,4.9567,0.9704,0.7726,9.2876,0.8497,4.7609,6.7957,3.2289,2.7071,1.1677,3.2642,7.3752,0.5925,0.6749,2.4275,0.2501,0.1084,0.6077,0.9462,5.2896,6.2654,0.1872,6.6401,4.1287,5.3206,1.2052,3.3228,3.9048,5.9908,0.2595,2.1776,0.0034,1.3307,1.3505,4.2007,0.0733,3.9541,4.8347,2.1861,3.7084,2.7236,3.4252,0.0853,5.3264,4.8734,1.7086,3.8495,2.2904,3.1818,2.4341,1.677,0.6909,0.4124,14.2737,2.5551,2.6242,1.3851,1.7948,4.9202,1.7838,6.1184,0.6099,4.1409,2.7665,6.2109,1.2323,2.4531,2.7544,5.3339,0.214,3.8626,6.5171,6.1449,0.186,2.7161,1.6208,6.175,4.5382,1.38,3.2425,1.1198,2.5589,0.014,1.3195,6.8738,0.6258,3.1635,1.662,2.8698,1.6506,0.5683,0.3577,2.4233,5.5261,4.7181,6.3077,0.8247,0.8076,2.7365,1.9938,4.6215,0.507,1.1948,1.5759,1.6649,6.104,1.245,5.4941,1.2778,3.9725,0.2719,0.7038,4.5246,4.763,2.7303,2.3027,0.5853,3.8815,0.3162,3.0503,0.0043,4.0351,2.3751,2.1965,1.3101,4.7975,4.9427,0.8784,3.5217,3.0154,3.0545,4.8848,6.7866,3.5104,0.0027,0.0039,0.0,0.0,3.4191,3.5233,4.6307,2.2042,6.5513,5.0503,7.4022,4.4488,0.0019,1.8968,0.6339,3.3407,4.5426,3.5203,4.7408,1.1019,2.8592,3.6181,5.7354,2.385,2.5471,4.8243,0.1424,0.0727,3.7888,5.9663,2.4149,3.5433,2.0547,0.7414,2.5274,0.4658,3.8894,0.0021,0.0,4.5787,3.8221,3.3358,2.0164,2.0314,0.8003,0.9239,1.437,0.8044,0.388,2.6276,2.6268,4.3556,2.8428,1.3627,3.8734,3.2667,0.0,0.858,0.1967,1.6576,3.4745,6.1281,5.042,2.5239,5.5666,0.6658,2.2978,4.3477,1.1925,5.1525,0.6866,1.8615,1.0637,1.0657,0.0891,5.4238,1.6471,0.9419,0.46,0.6229,0.217,0.1614,3.1545,1.0468,3.0574,4.2185,2.5717,0.4348,3.8272,0.0006,2.6851,1.2177,5.2967,5.8447,4.4899,3.2007,2.5646,1.1024,4.2631,4.0853,4.1871,0.1648,6.4395,1.2644,2.4694,1.8314,6.7685,3.1058,0.3014,1.3198,0.2636,4.8402,1.4284,1.526,0.3676,1.9951,2.5941,1.4787,0.6523,0.8223,0.1264,4.7656,5.5557,0.6487,5.6514,3.3577,3.7202,4.1965,1.2747,5.7319,3.2728,2.7368,2.4188,1.4713,4.0831,2.8906,4.1224,1.8422,3.8375,1.6427,2.1605,3.0144,2.1632,4.6156,2.017,2.9769,1.6589,4.6591,2.4438,2.7531,3.1299,4.6186,0.2598,4.07,3.2314,6.018,2.1242,3.8045,5.4519,4.9382,0.8992,0.7439,0.0335,1.9361,3.0908,1.4037,0.9553,1.481,0.7701,0.0208,2.068,0.9267,1.0116,1.6444,1.1592,3.9879,3.0098,0.1408,2.5027,0.2375,0.5887,4.9842,5.0445,0.9714,0.1743,3.5418,3.4415,2.6019,6.0393,1.0105,2.6522,0.6567,0.2113,1.4458,6.0531,2.0422,0.093,2.0744,0.2068,2.3487,0.0607,1.5072,3.7119,2.3495,0.2529,1.1572,0.012,0.2941,2.9485,1.9997,0.3037,5.6592,0.9365,6.5598,4.7342,2.6993,1.6638,1.2673,2.3797,3.5084,2.5768,1.1322,2.0204,4.1748,1.731,3.4358,1.4793,5.4304,3.2561,0.1476,0.0009,5.8045,0.5151,1.9171,1.4564,4.1938,0.0021,3.7979,2.3573,0.0174,3.0876,0.0079,0.0001,0.0,0.0,4.0021,2.6209,0.6087,1.4416,3.2665,0.0004,4.2371,1.6091,1.971,4.6542,4.6092,1.7776,5.5142,0.0287,1.1603,4.7097,1.6425,0.4909,0.3864,0.345,6.1826,0.0006,4.9385,4.9303,3.9647,3.025,1.4675,2.6146,5.3932,1.2615,3.6811,1.4372,3.0303,2.172,4.7274,6.2804,4.3135,2.4752,4.7979,1.7582,1.6427,1.1896,3.0642,0.0024,2.5509,0.285,0.0041,2.85,0.0114,0.0004,0.001,0.0015,3.8897,3.1527,5.1526,3.7008,2.0825,2.1033,0.0015,2.5596,0.2466,0.7369,4.5501,0.5992,1.1558,0.2949,0.5111,6.917,1.3634,0.4028,4.3335,3.7899,0.5194,2.0644,0.0011,0.0003,0.0014,4.477,3.402,0.2266,1.5478,0.1817,4.4106,3.3634,0.0071,0.0,0.0001,4.0704,0.7226,2.9764,3.2773,0.3638,0.0758,4.2573,0.0001,1.3707,2.8156,0.9571,2.1991,3.4685,2.3235,1.3818,4.4176,1.57,1.9258,1.9617,1.8032,1.6939,3.0241,2.1316,4.8956,1.1418,0.501,1.8836,4.7062,0.0369,0.0042,0.026,0.001,0.9906,0.9709,0.2802,2.4308,4.0062,6.2698,3.7255,1.6908,7.9292,1.6566,5.7262,2.6612,2.7173,3.2651,1.1357,2.8109,1.8534,1.6856,4.899,3.3255,0.8461,1.8013,1.975,1.528,2.7924,3.5142,1.8329,2.448,2.0495,5.6931,1.1421,4.5497,0.9232,2.3187,5.1329,0.3461,0.3759,0.761,1.5749,2.133,3.6447,2.6548,9.5443,7.2719,4.4103,0.8858,5.7014,4.8246,1.9655,3.715,4.6741,1.261,3.1347,0.599,3.2349,2.3971,1.6618,1.2069,3.5089,2.6795,1.1239,0.8412,1.711,1.0463,1.4,4.6626,0.071,1.4789,1.2236,0.7129,2.1901,2.1321,1.4231,2.3797,2.6376,0.3861,2.8699,0.003,3.0364,5.0434,5.4218,4.6936,0.4986,4.723,0.0929,4.3238,6.1631,2.5926,7.5991,1.2411,2.338,10.1364,2.5094,2.5177,4.0807,0.6869,5.1514,1.7043,2.7657,3.4689,1.4597,3.9651,0.9477]}
{"id":4695,"ended":true,"length":566,"text":"With the help of Kirstie McLellan Day, Fleury wrote his autobiography, Playing with Fire, which was released on October 16, 2009. In it, he alleged that he was sexually harassed by a former friend, former teammate and current Capitals player Markstrom.\n\nFleury, who retired in 1999, told the Washington Post that he had no time to tell the interviewer what transpired since he did not have a girlfriend.\n\nIn the interview, Fleury told the interviewer that he has never ever felt ashamed of his sexuality and said that he would make jokes about how he and former teammate Markstrom and former Capitals defenseman Eric Staal were \"very proud\" of their respective careers.\n\n\"When you had sex with a team that was very strong in certain areas... you're very proud. And I wasn't ashamed of that at all,\" Fleury told the reporter.\n\nFleury added that he was a \"very proud\" player and that he was \"expecting the worst\".\n\nFleury also claimed that he was a \"very good\" player.\n\nHe went on to tell the interviewer that he has a girlfriend and that she had been dating him for six years and had told him that she was \"very, very, very close\" to him.\n\nThe interviewer said that he went to a \"very good\" college and that she had been married for three years before he moved to New York.\n\n\"She was very pretty. We both had long hair,\" Fleury said. \"But this one day, I asked her what she would prefer. And I was completely shocked.\"\n\nFleury also said that he had a good relationship with the man he went to college with, and that she worked with him throughout childhood.\n\nFleury also said that he also went to a school based in New York.\n\n\"I went to a school.

I'm in high school.\u2019 He just said, \u2018Hey, my wife is married.\u2019\"\n\nOne of Fleury's daughters, Shira Gill, who also attended an Academy Preparatory School in Washington, said that the two women knew each other so well that they often would pick up each other's hand.\n\nGill said that she got her first boyfriend in 2001 and they dated three and a half years and they got engaged in 2002. She said that he had had a number of relationships with her in college and that he was \"very strong\" and that he was \"extremely strong\"\n\nShe told the interviewer that she had been in many different relationships and that he had tried to put her in the top five for his career.\n\nThe interview was filmed in an industrial zone at the top of a building in the Washington DC area.\n\nIn a later interview, Fleury explained that he was afraid of harassment and he had even been told that his \"girlfriend was a lesbian\".","token_len":619,"entropy":[2.3156,3.6416,0.0206,11.2532,2.5585,7.4801,2.7019,0.0526,11.1772,0.5214,10.3628,2.6097,6.1024,4.8727,3.6117,1.1181,8.7712,2.3964,1.6585,1.0352,1.9125,2.0702,1.702,2.1218,2.8746,3.6617,0.8461,3.679,0.3191,3.3121,1.047,0.4393,0.9644,8.354,0.3334,1.3181,1.0904,2.8903,2.3785,0.5845,2.0791,2.7999,3.3405,1.7704,5.3123,3.916,2.1343,3.4035,8.2344,2.664,4.9047,9.9285,0.8171,0.8129,0.0005,2.6517,0.0005,2.7034,0.5078,4.251,1.5388,4.533,0.524,2.7899,1.2819,2.8478,0.0488,0.8956,0.6547,2.2354,3.1952,8.0288,0.6443,4.7313,1.6688,7.6106,3.3578,4.9969,5.8479,0.8919,3.9014,0.1751,2.7634,1.9299,4.5127,0.9481,0.8226,0.0002,3.6494,1.7631,2.2723,0.29,0.7058,0.0007,3.3426,0.4623,3.0455,0.7172,0.3891,3.7575,2.046,5.4521,3.0183,5.2294,1.8618,0.8306,2.3049,1.9417,2.2721,1.0628,0.4658,2.9049,5.8321,4.6898,0.3469,3.3918,0.7639,5.1476,4.9237,0.3976,1.1995,0.383,5.6989,3.1234,1.3452,3.0045,5.8786,2.443,0.0041,1.8303,1.7103,4.4818,4.738,1.0105,0.249,2.1214,5.2204,1.8395,0.2463,0.2482,0.0001,0.9669,3.9596,1.4742,5.5963,4.5544,0.6864,1.6932,5.1435,3.7136,1.5001,3.7683,4.1416,3.0426,6.0538,1.0,6.4925,2.064,3.2111,3.5101,0.3113,3.899,2.2261,1.8553,5.2249,0.0006,1.767,1.1179,1.62,1.8968,0.2043,0.5651,0.1521,0.0003,1.8547,0.1866,3.5617,0.2693,1.2184,0.0002,1.2711,0.0004,4.2355,0.3969,0.4878,2.2816,3.557,1.4696,2.7275,2.7858,1.7779,1.2363,1.2661,1.6283,0.5482,2.0595,1.7814,6.4122,2.1724,2.8672,3.1288,4.5502,0.1989,0.0001,1.7282,0.0006,2.3993,3.0676,0.3344,0.8024,1.5152,3.3178,1.1337,2.1646,2.6391,2.8012,1.5122,2.4662,0.3696,0.0001,3.3146,4.7024,0.0553,0.0807,3.3535,0.1504,1.7162,0.31,0.4114,2.9946,2.7422,3.8486,1.3265,0.8048,3.0666,3.1322,2.5296,2.2557,1.4312,0.5038,3.1148,0.4536,2.4615,2.1338,3.8595,0.1352,1.3552,1.1496,1.3089,1.6795,2.0569,3.8834,0.0129,3.7761,0.3613,4.2935,1.3387,0.2178,0.6914,0.6594,0.2044,0.0001,2.7554,5.7092,3.1247,0.4927,1.6738,5.0935,1.1683,1.862,4.1717,1.4275,1.7546,0.7692,4.9519,1.7357,1.4187,4.0393,2.0171,1.6361,3.447,0.8692,2.6105,0.1698,3.264,1.468,3.5224,0.6358,2.5601,0.3357,0.7238,0.3285,0.0002,1.9155,1.4936,1.3808,1.2936,4.7475,2.0874,4.7015,4.754,1.3021,6.7921,0.3536,1.7141,0.0626,0.0005,0.5201,0.3367,0.4141,3.5003,5.137,3.4623,4.3266,1.2524,1.6239,4.3806,0.1432,2.4561,0.4889,3.984,6.702,1.4956,2.2648,3.6397,2.5905,5.8375,2.229,2.5062,0.106,0.0002,0.7568,0.0006,2.084,1.1118,0.2823,0.388,1.7338,2.105,4.3229,0.7527,0.0303,2.6348,4.8325,1.165,5.5082,0.1281,0.9266,0.0541,1.5733,2.1645,0.4771,4.6152,5.4476,1.5238,0.1282,4.5747,6.044,0.5148,0.1736,0.0001,1.4442,0.0006,1.5637,0.9589,0.1858,0.3933,5.251,3.922,0.2025,1.4736,3.5721,7.1387,0.353,2.081,0.373,2.7424,0.4044,0.0001,1.2248,1.1902,2.2366,0.2027,1.2372,0.9714,5.4521,0.7818,5.1534,2.3595,3.9027,0.3955,0.6624,1.3443,4.0832,2.2863,3.3562,1.7717,2.0092,0.0488,1.5907,0.0439,0.3968,1.1323,3.0931,14.0838,10.2182,4.5039,5.4172,2.9058,1.1246,1.9771,3.4437,5.2907,0.0042,0.909,7.5398,6.8306,4.7192,4.0479,1.4881,0.4985,3.3787,0.7398,4.1477,0.2682,4.8716,5.6273,1.3532,4.5757,1.2979,3.2806,0.2074,3.5819,0.0926,0.0002,6.2184,0.5642,1.261,0.0017,0.0027,5.0116,0.6832,6.3014,4.5726,7.5396,1.4977,2.9236,3.3713,1.9166,4.8092,6.324,7.3192,0.0409,1.0198,0.5099,3.6141,0.3247,1.4409,0.7264,2.701,3.5108,4.7341,5.0998,0.1681,0.007,5.5247,0.1612,1.1123,0.5598,4.6304,4.3476,5.7034,0.7856,1.6972,0.0093,1.4645,4.3354,3.2306,0.1697,0.0001,3.4309,0.0549,1.0629,0.2581,1.4497,5.165,3.5331,0.3008,3.5521,1.7205,4.095,1.995,3.8804,2.2412,4.9519,5.1888,0.2553,0.0014,0.053,6.7065,2.68,3.123,2.0716,0.4242,3.6144,0.1882,2.2663,0.5465,0.2407,3.4459,2.8674,5.178,1.5202,3.884,0.0034,2.4482,0.8262,2.9291,3.3575,4.8914,1.0503,1.2159,1.387,1.8273,1.9599,1.0797,4.9804,1.6264,1.7091,1.967,1.0924,1.4042,1.1869,4.299,3.9064,1.0613,8.5033,0.0002,2.7305,3.7235,0.2033,1.7801,0.1603,1.0421,2.0681,1.9991,2.698,5.43,3.001,0.2918,2.1997,0.5486,1.927,1.2929,4.4328,0.1964,4.7195,0.4971,1.3718,2.1959,5.25,1.8643,3.6896,3.4636,2.828,0.6693,0.2787,0.0001,2.842,1.663,1.27,4.2457,2.0378,4.0253,7.0917,5.2185,2.6509,0.8868,6.42,0.083,1.9931,1.9938,1.3195,1.3092,4.0439,3.9102,0.6264,0.9595,0.8188,0.0002,3.5743,2.1183,4.1856,0.4609,0.8845,0.2707,0.0013,4.7937,0.3977,0.3575,1.8639,5.3952,1.3215,5.609,1.6228,3.3429,2.437,4.8262,1.8153,2.7756,0.8909,2.3972,3.6073,3.5937,2.2243,1.9948,5.3158,1.3709]}
{"id":1482,"ended":true,"length":591,"text":"When access to digital computers became possible in the middle fifties, a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could produce the desired result. As computers turned into machines, they also discovered that physical control of the symbols and numbers involved considerable knowledge of mathematical mathematics.\nIt was in these mathematical laws that computing was first used in the context of a theoretical computation. Although computers were created in the beginning of the 20th century to solve a basic system problem, they were not the first and only technological application of math and geometry, but they also established new and significant mathematical applications.\nOne early example of a mathematical problem solved through mathematical manipulation was by the French mathematician Jean Bouchet who had pioneered the field because his mathematical work was a work to help to solve a mathematical problem. A very important example was the mathematical problem known as the Fourier model. In this case, the inverse of the inverse of the Fourier transform is used by Fourier model in most areas of maths. The Fourier transform is an example of mathematics that also allows the reduction of the inverse of the inverse of the inverse of the Fourier transform.\nThe first example and one that has become popular is the method used by French mathematician Jean Bouchet to solve a mathematical problem. The Fourier transform is an example where Fourier models can be employed in their entirety. This is because it allows for reducing the inverse of the Fourier transform to a finite and therefore finite Fourier transformation of the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform only reduces the inverse of the inverse of the Fourier transform to the most efficient way. The Fourier transform does not produce the result from the computation of a mathematical calculation, it only creates a mathematical result. A Fourier transform that is also used in mathematics also creates a mathematical result, it does not produce any result, and it creates mathematical error.\nIn light of these mathematical laws, other examples of mathematical problems were devised by French mathematician Jean Paul Belmond who had discovered that mathematical algorithms were actually more efficient than they could be. For example, in his first paper he proposed that the inverse of the inverse of the inverse of the Fourier transform can be obtained at the lowest possible cost to the user through the process of adding an element. The inverse of the inverse of the Fourier transform has an actual cost of about 300 times as low as the cost of a mathematical application.\nAnother example of mathematical problems that are highly advantageous for mathematics is the problem of energy efficiency. Since energy is a parameter of the calculations used for a computer, it is an important parameter to consider in the calculation of computing power or memory. Because energy is dependent on the size of the file that is made available on the computer, the calculation can often be performed in many megabytes, but it is only limited by the size of the file. In the event there is a disaster, the computers will be destroyed. The computers running the program can only run a fraction of the number of files that a computer would normally run.","token_len":619,"entropy":[8.909,0.6793,7.0421,7.1149,4.6267,3.1871,1.6942,0.4832,5.7038,11.7095,0.0009,0.0011,0.3815,3.4535,3.8901,5.7472,10.2361,3.878,0.8391,2.9801,5.427,3.243,0.7732,4.7477,5.2314,1.9628,1.51,2.2517,6.5453,2.0881,5.9823,2.3172,5.8057,0.5935,1.5179,1.1938,5.249,3.9832,2.7419,1.6367,0.1709,4.1052,3.5915,6.0377,1.6154,2.06,0.3997,2.0795,2.8468,5.6544,0.5847,5.2397,5.3969,1.1713,2.5438,2.4142,2.2139,3.5351,4.3952,6.2466,4.846,1.3983,2.7974,4.4927,0.7628,1.687,10.2545,0.9623,2.6841,2.6052,3.474,6.5377,0.4233,8.0591,1.8623,2.6796,3.5308,1.6068,0.8965,4.9332,0.0036,3.2268,6.2627,5.907,0.9773,4.3,3.4303,1.0477,5.234,1.544,1.007,5.1214,0.2435,0.1278,1.3441,0.0053,0.0147,2.0176,2.4281,3.6645,5.2647,7.0595,1.2877,0.4765,1.4874,0.826,1.5393,2.7779,0.5619,4.8662,1.86,4.7469,5.4585,0.4214,5.117,3.1465,3.3017,3.2723,2.7835,0.9657,4.1268,4.8841,3.2392,3.5176,4.8849,1.6809,3.5841,1.3892,1.7968,3.9031,5.1991,0.7474,0.4836,1.6092,0.832,3.0968,4.3657,4.1953,1.4791,3.3924,0.8245,5.7796,2.0404,3.8395,0.0749,2.4349,6.4129,3.9436,3.1168,3.4262,6.2693,0.6676,4.6486,8.9257,3.0161,2.6735,2.8269,1.6227,4.857,4.6369,7.0054,4.5289,4.5002,2.0027,2.4168,1.792,0.0648,0.9046,3.9997,5.4601,2.3576,2.6267,1.9593,0.962,3.5588,0.8888,4.8566,0.0211,1.2524,4.3983,0.0014,6.736,1.0285,2.3087,1.5839,2.8974,0.241,0.859,7.9008,0.6804,0.5735,5.4377,0.3938,0.4513,3.369,0.0003,2.4668,1.3059,3.2731,4.8229,1.7644,0.0002,7.8188,4.0352,6.4721,5.8141,0.1468,7.0423,0.655,1.7288,1.5759,0.0002,0.6546,0.8473,2.7148,4.3302,0.0556,4.8332,1.3799,6.1779,3.554,1.7221,5.8307,0.1109,0.8958,3.0377,0.5455,0.2829,1.1817,0.7981,0.3321,1.4888,0.6491,0.2204,1.6872,0.0005,0.1199,0.896,0.9904,1.6644,2.9572,3.1441,6.9131,3.5855,1.7446,2.4152,2.3221,2.1166,1.3401,0.4846,5.4269,2.4953,0.6813,4.3015,0.2821,2.2525,2.2066,0.0037,0.8266,0.555,0.8797,1.0285,0.0274,0.6714,1.6135,0.8999,0.0007,0.4384,0.5436,1.887,0.2853,6.2763,3.4208,0.0009,4.6342,2.3546,0.3115,5.7144,1.8828,5.9299,4.0693,1.3298,2.9311,1.3808,1.4058,3.036,1.3561,2.6321,7.2056,0.2652,0.6493,0.1172,0.0871,2.421,0.0011,0.0387,1.3255,1.7896,4.4282,4.7698,5.4333,3.2559,7.688,0.001,3.8188,3.9236,0.4985,4.2478,0.0008,0.3885,0.3854,1.6508,1.1082,0.0011,0.2931,7.1748,3.9086,0.3522,0.4161,0.2551,0.0689,1.0524,0.3504,0.043,0.5986,0.0011,0.014,1.0715,2.1492,5.4737,3.7675,6.0931,3.0336,1.8333,1.3599,0.0008,0.2052,3.9961,0.1748,4.8821,1.2276,2.7003,5.7434,0.8478,5.5874,0.5123,1.5908,2.5038,5.7473,1.6382,2.2576,1.1753,3.6338,1.9472,3.5996,1.6819,0.9572,4.3918,2.9993,0.0008,0.6159,3.678,1.9239,4.2569,1.7332,0.8728,2.4736,5.043,4.0897,0.563,1.19,0.2674,2.4934,3.9884,2.6147,0.1596,0.6587,4.0884,1.5785,2.558,1.8198,1.5142,4.3559,5.1551,4.5919,0.6479,0.8444,2.1874,7.1084,0.001,1.7347,2.5815,1.9556,0.3152,6.6593,3.2067,0.5847,0.5894,0.674,2.8737,4.4602,1.4725,2.2872,0.7917,1.5866,6.0732,5.9948,4.9281,2.0282,2.7396,3.9386,1.9754,3.4813,5.4956,2.1889,5.1462,3.5796,1.1667,0.3814,5.2013,2.1445,0.1186,1.6539,3.665,0.3084,0.0605,2.0627,1.3621,3.6788,2.5304,1.4046,3.0174,1.0014,1.6038,4.8602,0.109,0.1757,0.7827,0.0738,0.1661,0.8337,0.1441,0.1698,0.6815,0.0009,0.0244,2.285,0.1132,4.387,5.1595,1.2325,4.8074,1.3861,2.7406,4.6248,1.569,3.656,3.797,1.3024,5.8036,0.0316,5.2833,2.9707,2.9933,2.6167,2.2037,2.5583,0.3382,0.0429,0.6832,0.3146,0.0224,0.4688,0.0015,0.0138,3.7956,3.4968,5.8782,1.9006,0.8938,3.6032,5.4587,2.2848,3.3895,4.6718,0.164,0.3733,2.3404,0.1441,2.8834,3.097,6.1657,0.8907,1.0694,2.5709,0.7569,0.5586,1.1939,0.236,1.1626,2.8697,5.8297,6.4544,1.5013,4.0941,1.1509,0.4858,1.6286,0.1347,6.441,5.6754,0.2102,4.5826,1.8423,0.829,1.408,6.2935,0.7032,1.6605,6.6139,3.6055,2.5428,4.5187,3.5979,0.7268,1.2828,0.5076,4.236,0.9706,1.0268,1.7037,1.5107,1.7837,2.0647,1.5978,0.0913,4.5041,0.6511,5.4383,5.642,0.5693,4.3604,1.8562,0.4062,6.4238,0.1724,0.8098,4.2298,0.3626,0.4927,7.2892,3.4975,0.9529,6.5678,0.5842,2.8827,0.9186,0.8122,0.2933,1.7756,2.9275,4.7994,4.0611,0.7079,1.964,1.5531,3.3596,6.2419,0.1113,2.3902,2.4807,2.2492,0.849,4.1676,5.0606,0.8924,0.2263,1.0585,0.0595,0.2074,0.5864,1.4431,2.329,2.1395,6.4042,5.9615,0.4642,1.1433,7.1735,1.121,1.1203,5.867,2.5823,2.0276,4.4006,1.3097,2.2308,4.2121,5.3698,1.2854,2.3526,3.0374,2.7521,2.8155,3.6222,3.0811,0.0283,0.2298,3.5741,0.0194,3.2079,0.7797,4.5718,1.1667,2.4005,2.4225,1.7261,0.7696]}

In the latter role, Robertsons second term was considered to be \"national real estate\" for reasons such as expansion of the City's \"green building\" by building and the creation of a new historic district in Queens along with the expansion of the newly completed Empire State Building in the City's core and a major new downtown and retail development.\n\nReferences","token_len":619,"entropy":[6.6522,8.2221,0.4621,6.4613,1.7351,3.4898,8.3753,2.344,2.973,1.8427,8.5863,4.2761,1.4098,2.6313,2.9269,2.4482,1.4434,1.7773,2.0233,3.4517,4.532,1.8467,3.3885,7.1587,4.2031,1.3934,2.5472,0.3934,0.6541,3.6974,5.9307,10.0525,0.3759,1.5181,1.4301,8.6197,3.2919,1.5534,1.0769,1.4144,1.7997,3.6765,0.3065,0.4923,4.4629,3.2601,6.7783,0.0034,5.0954,1.8515,4.4641,5.9462,3.6314,5.0007,0.7158,2.7872,10.1462,6.6987,3.4296,1.8323,0.0352,0.0169,0.6761,0.7736,5.2202,5.5114,1.1742,1.6444,2.414,0.1255,6.8691,1.5894,2.2789,0.985,26.3463,0.0013,1.6808,0.1191,0.4207,0.2666,3.2903,5.3326,1.8168,0.3696,0.0342,1.427,11.7323,11.8664,1.2588,0.3695,0.0075,0.0217,0.1732,0.1506,0.0278,0.0024,2.0179,5.0395,2.259,4.2831,0.0867,0.4164,1.4953,1.3046,6.1895,0.5649,4.9704,2.7371,2.623,1.475,2.9332,2.7597,1.5921,2.2312,0.9367,1.6067,0.0003,4.4831,0.6366,7.0124,5.9586,1.2603,2.2832,0.0153,0.4256,0.4033,0.5817,0.0594,0.0043,0.5629,1.7093,3.475,3.4833,2.378,8.1475,7.2007,4.9806,1.6018,0.9026,5.9012,1.5791,3.3856,1.1696,3.3076,4.7615,1.4953,5.3594,4.5995,1.3222,1.8539,0.0003,6.4025,0.0365,1.9388,1.4127,3.2511,0.1355,0.004,0.0424,0.2994,0.0692,0.0047,0.0034,1.3063,0.4265,0.3276,4.5626,5.4589,1.076,0.9141,0.9445,0.1668,1.3158,0.1856,0.0048,0.6499,6.8823,2.5284,4.0055,6.0816,0.0033,0.9937,2.2193,4.0584,1.3311,5.8788,2.702,2.0078,0.7582,2.8839,2.1211,6.8524,1.148,3.822,0.7781,3.9079,0.0393,2.4874,1.6257,2.3388,4.1572,0.2294,4.984,2.7508,5.5484,4.2906,3.8203,0.1177,5.619,6.7498,1.8017,1.2485,5.5955,7.8037,3.3682,0.7465,1.2307,0.0237,1.7272,0.2325,3.7157,5.9984,0.4459,4.303,0.2225,2.2581,2.6453,3.0101,0.004,0.075,3.5135,0.5433,2.7088,0.0626,3.1744,0.1259,2.676,3.7441,1.7697,6.3159,0.6093,0.3472,5.2279,1.8045,3.8882,7.5273,3.7091,0.3567,0.785,0.9491,4.1638,2.863,2.0121,0.4094,4.2047,2.5273,0.3666,1.1424,0.3212,7.495,1.5656,3.1543,0.0258,5.7011,5.6971,1.6825,6.9082,2.7023,0.3792,6.0532,0.4981,4.1765,5.0697,0.5892,6.3445,1.8525,0.1197,1.8834,5.1283,6.6066,5.8166,1.3579,5.3155,2.223,5.822,2.9902,7.0476,1.636,0.8771,5.201,0.6524,0.018,3.5624,0.2318,1.3244,0.1803,2.9493,0.0373,2.7155,0.0141,3.7997,5.6501,3.0975,2.0967,3.4239,0.0055,2.1153,0.0539,1.9956,6.4863,0.2761,5.8276,7.9511,0.179,0.6037,2.6336,4.6609,3.8274,4.9545,3.6318,8.1597,3.1772,0.8374,0.0002,1.7714,0.2185,1.6977,0.1806,1.9682,0.8849,0.0385,4.0599,0.1724,0.003,0.1393,8.2774,3.8548,5.0137,0.9177,0.6744,0.104,0.0145,4.2503,0.6378,0.534,1.3512,2.6097,1.3852,1.2049,0.0492,0.266,0.8958,0.568,0.9471,0.9997,3.2399,3.586,0.1673,3.7604,1.789,2.2277,0.7985,1.8264,0.0265,0.3477,4.5162,4.9406,0.5634,1.7998,1.3501,2.6679,2.7037,2.5747,4.8347,1.6162,0.1066,0.2701,2.835,5.2086,5.5271,0.0074,0.0162,0.0767,4.0237,0.0691,0.0911,3.2374,1.2127,0.0003,4.1777,0.358,1.2631,0.0018,3.8472,0.0336,1.5235,0.037,1.1911,0.1292,2.3979,4.1866,0.019,1.5798,0.0765,1.077,1.6529,9.8709,12.0092,6.4111,4.3295,0.0192,0.0949,0.7826,0.1975,3.2944,3.3984,7.056,1.725,4.2736,1.9877,0.2414,0.9194,1.5458,0.0082,2.1896,0.0465,0.6648,3.6729,1.2799,0.2149,1.3766,3.0318,0.5549,1.6538,3.1838,4.8977,0.9238,1.3029,0.0043,1.6515,0.0385,6.1106,1.138,2.6057,2.0782,4.994,2.2114,1.1643,0.8257,0.0002,5.3317,0.8842,0.0993,2.3838,0.1101,1.4331,2.0963,0.5605,1.3857,1.8627,0.0134,0.0688,0.1959,5.1185,0.6252,0.6744,0.3462,0.7582,3.5558,0.0809,0.5199,4.4372,0.3709,4.2706,0.8496,0.707,0.2613,3.1457,1.2549,4.434,1.1358,2.4929,3.0445,0.1634,4.6078,0.7304,0.5157,0.1965,3.608,3.8141,0.4852,1.7866,1.3535,0.8822,0.1061,1.6498,2.7893,1.3335,2.3011,6.1069,4.907,1.9396,4.0243,0.6168,1.256,3.7105,0.0896,5.9958,0.945,0.3009,3.5053,0.019,0.7949,3.1188,0.1851,0.4037,0.3179,2.9506,0.0071,0.4248,0.0155,4.9763,1.6064,2.0462,0.0015,0.5748,5.2863,1.7471,2.9423,1.5203,2.3247,3.6967,6.6605,5.1281,6.0916,5.9129,1.8813,2.8644,4.6908,1.9458,1.0389,3.1092,0.3374,0.6601,5.656,2.3718,0.7852,2.6791,2.4321,4.8281,5.2064,0.412,0.5412,0.0025,0.4925,0.0135,0.6356,3.5212,0.5057,0.1611,2.8215,6.6841,6.7522,0.0418,2.147,2.8748,5.1877,3.8182,0.0026,8.3046,0.6106,1.441,5.0881,0.6733,4.9425,5.2632,5.4405,0.9581,5.2696,3.7478,4.0529,6.1302,3.9961,0.0279,1.6423,1.4105,6.442,0.8469,2.3786,4.761,6.117,1.6248,1.149,4.4472,0.0542,0.6757,5.9371,3.2124,5.0727,0.47,0.0553,2.3661,2.3734,3.8867,2.357,5.1417,3.2049,3.0003,4.0091,2.364,4.8218,4.1226,5.0504,3.3605,1.547,0.675,0.0002,6.543]}
{"id":4687,"ended":false,"length":531,"text":"Tracking through the state as a weakening tropical storm, Humberto produced light to moderate winds across southwestern Louisiana. Gusts officially peaked at 43 mph ( 69 km \/ h ) in the state, the center of Humberto, south of St. Louis, just before 2:00 am (15:00 GMT on Tuesday, Sept. 12). It formed out of the Atlantic Ocean around 6:00 am (1800 GMT), and dissipated slightly northward about 3:35am (6:35am GMT) in the east, reaching St. Louis at 20 mph (35 kph). The center of Humberto remained offshore until about 8:00 am (7 p.m. EST), and had wind speeds above the midpoint near the central city and was a relatively deep low. The center dissipated near 3:40am (7 p.m. EST), and turned south before dissipating away from Florida.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Marine Corps Corps (MCX), in most areas, Humberto was a tropical storm with winds reaching maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (40 km\/h ). It is believed to have weakened and weakened in time for landfall. The tropical storm dissipated quickly and was centered about 16 miles (21 km) offshore from Louisiana where it weakened slightly, allowing for a further drop in the winds. During his landfall in St. Louis, Humberto weakened quickly, giving the storm another drop in speeds. It dissipated about 23 miles (40 kilometers) south of St. Louis, but also traveled east to north in Florida.\n\nIt was the second storm of that kind-turned-tropical-storm season. On Oct. 24\u201325, the storm hit the Florida coast with maximum sustained winds of 32 mph (47 km \/ h) over southeastern Wisconsin and southwest Mississippi. It was named Humberto.\n\nAs a sign of the intensity of the storm, U.S. meteorologists were forecasting that the storm would come ashore for the first time in Louisiana since 2004. However, no date was set.\n\nHumberto is an important storm in the North Atlantic ocean in the same region which has dominated tropical-storm season, with nearly 50 percent of the Atlantic's ocean zone being designated a tropical cyclone in the same year. The warm seas, cold air, and an ever- warmer atmosphere make it a powerful hurricane, but at times the track can be dangerous, especially on the high seas which are an area of tropical energy.\n\nHumberto is expected in a tropical storm or tropical storm formation around the Atlantic by late Saturday or early Sunday.\n\nThe USMC Corps of Engineers warned the storm was not expected to weaken after it was identified by the USN Hurricane Center as a tropical storm. \"This is a tropical cyclone with a strong and prolonged path of destruction,\" the USMCA said online. However, the storm's path was not expected to cross the eastern Atlantic Ocean and over the northwestern coast of Alabama.\n\nRelated articles:","token_len":620,"entropy":[7.7407,5.9371,1.2596,6.6125,6.7881,1.6314,13.3354,10.2331,1.3135,1.9132,7.3725,5.8697,0.7761,9.834,8.69,3.8086,4.9341,2.2328,4.9028,6.3285,3.7912,1.4506,8.9859,0.243,11.1711,4.0558,1.2284,5.7835,0.4152,2.1579,12.7201,1.0479,5.7482,1.9657,1.9121,1.862,1.2294,4.4866,3.1417,3.9212,7.0502,0.1869,3.9235,0.0745,0.0027,2.7537,6.1712,0.1728,4.703,0.0696,1.7767,1.253,5.112,1.4469,4.166,2.0978,1.4044,2.8108,1.7024,4.5165,0.7016,0.0181,1.4303,3.6909,2.498,2.1715,3.4872,0.139,3.6053,0.5916,3.9606,6.8889,5.4098,0.107,1.0626,4.0648,0.7318,3.5391,3.3913,0.6106,0.9042,0.5693,0.2281,6.6026,0.0372,3.2392,1.8745,6.2602,0.0039,6.6651,3.6686,0.7589,3.8776,2.4686,1.5593,6.712,5.4185,0.1058,4.0464,0.0245,0.2954,3.5035,0.4309,1.5948,2.3458,0.5985,4.9534,1.9876,4.7788,6.7329,0.0025,0.7304,1.943,6.0393,2.6497,0.0303,3.6607,4.807,0.1652,1.0276,1.8297,4.0325,0.647,1.583,0.001,0.0043,4.202,5.864,2.3116,1.6268,2.5638,0.1724,0.7513,0.364,0.0677,3.4157,7.6042,0.0009,0.0003,0.1408,3.1264,4.0385,1.6335,5.2011,5.1809,0.2928,4.2842,3.084,4.1294,1.3694,5.6509,1.6324,5.5059,4.4181,5.1939,5.2741,5.2377,3.8523,5.2922,4.8326,2.618,1.8389,2.0429,7.3496,0.0012,5.2273,5.3419,0.1657,2.255,2.0061,0.1047,2.3592,1.665,0.0007,0.0002,0.1126,0.1349,0.9885,0.8939,5.7777,2.1202,5.0874,3.7616,0.002,5.8926,0.9857,5.8795,1.1873,1.0463,0.0028,5.3891,0.0042,1.0829,2.8381,0.0022,0.02,0.0025,5.0784,0.6628,6.0093,4.1659,4.0802,8.2561,0.3006,4.2588,6.6764,2.6158,1.6147,1.5044,0.0066,0.0063,1.6625,2.0411,1.7161,0.4799,2.1745,2.6886,4.0034,5.7783,1.3426,0.1585,0.4057,3.7779,0.5445,0.0583,2.9778,0.6706,0.2866,0.0051,6.3591,2.4178,3.4007,3.8377,0.911,0.324,4.7966,3.746,1.9812,2.4388,5.5081,2.9268,1.8714,2.1168,1.9439,3.9167,0.2403,7.529,0.0023,4.5344,1.8315,2.0968,4.4418,2.5421,5.8082,0.3881,1.4132,3.0349,0.4533,0.0416,2.2295,3.0529,3.7714,5.4971,0.3291,5.1787,2.8277,2.5853,7.2462,2.5631,1.3214,5.2759,5.7395,0.6029,1.8634,4.3248,0.6207,4.9559,5.945,2.7186,2.7319,3.2199,0.0029,0.3493,0.337,0.9123,0.0035,0.0122,5.6194,4.2796,1.3346,5.6075,1.9917,1.4843,5.1301,6.7221,0.7258,6.9487,1.2224,2.8656,4.8479,0.0005,2.2654,4.8623,0.1066,0.1349,3.1911,5.5187,0.0457,2.5841,0.3008,1.6052,0.0011,0.0766,1.2817,3.0749,4.9849,4.5758,3.5082,3.3575,5.2428,3.434,3.7373,1.1011,0.7542,0.0002,4.2896,1.0336,2.3725,1.9519,2.275,2.8315,6.6976,3.6113,7.0021,6.3764,0.0333,0.2102,0.0053,1.3975,0.1756,2.264,2.4493,2.6191,2.7648,0.0154,3.4442,6.9426,0.379,0.143,3.4345,2.4375,4.1904,1.4586,3.5345,1.2512,2.5006,4.2056,0.0947,0.0466,0.1185,4.2489,0.0633,0.0028,3.8384,0.1447,4.6151,0.1323,4.0917,4.444,4.5562,7.8965,1.5374,4.0113,4.7351,0.5686,1.6451,1.1322,4.5945,4.3033,0.0682,0.0278,3.1113,1.131,0.0003,4.4772,2.6598,6.1244,0.2171,1.3579,4.6516,0.1128,0.5117,0.9402,0.5595,4.6142,0.0047,0.0042,0.0029,5.0975,0.2702,3.7436,3.5656,2.3892,1.5355,1.0722,0.5684,4.8526,0.6535,4.0579,2.0801,0.892,0.0111,1.0493,6.8698,5.157,4.9153,0.5058,3.6892,0.0097,4.2205,5.1579,1.0393,1.4703,2.4505,0.9284,0.0003,2.8799,0.0523,0.0052,2.1924,3.6742,3.5735,2.6354,1.7904,0.5532,5.5398,0.2528,5.328,4.4443,1.0732,4.58,4.0082,5.9164,1.9153,5.6331,4.3418,3.6359,0.2221,3.7251,3.5658,2.6021,5.9251,3.4401,2.0895,0.0545,0.6047,2.2136,3.9535,3.5986,6.2058,2.5064,6.1124,2.6407,0.3999,2.7647,0.0074,2.3775,2.0186,4.9895,0.8479,0.3523,2.0631,7.0499,5.3869,3.2091,5.653,2.0912,1.1362,0.3868,5.7533,4.1356,0.181,9.9722,3.6768,3.1062,1.5262,1.7116,3.7044,2.0015,1.8973,2.1039,5.3234,2.5454,2.7839,8.2298,2.2865,1.0174,3.1599,2.531,1.4341,3.2716,1.3571,3.2356,0.8457,5.9706,1.195,5.9603,3.2596,0.8165,4.3867,6.821,1.1847,0.7218,0.0003,2.4963,0.0177,0.0076,1.2091,3.6189,6.1834,4.5314,2.2527,1.1864,3.9723,1.9611,1.0074,5.1613,3.9117,2.1043,4.39,4.2129,3.1005,4.7976,1.8799,0.3361,0.0349,1.0354,1.4007,0.0004,2.5752,5.7989,5.1555,5.5582,1.3411,0.0313,4.8236,2.5401,2.4336,3.0783,4.0675,1.3421,0.0536,3.9432,5.9045,2.0955,2.812,5.4248,1.8756,1.5678,2.7544,4.5581,3.0964,0.2224,1.4156,0.9767,1.1558,1.0087,1.3216,4.065,2.8277,1.5512,1.0824,2.3954,1.5947,0.0189,2.3916,1.4586,2.4686,3.6838,4.7622,3.3827,2.2157,5.4176,1.4893,1.1656,3.293,5.9459,3.0125,0.3615,9.2203,0.7038,4.8055,0.0317,1.2378,1.4106,2.172,1.896,1.4177,1.8138,2.1321,0.0162,3.8896,0.5487,4.5167,2.8772,2.7802,2.8122,6.7885,0.9376,6.62,2.6689,0.1707,4.9819,1.0334,0.5999,0.0003,4.9835,2.4638,1.2935]}

Amidships, it was 4 @. @ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick for a 10-foot sail. She was fitted with four berths for a maximum capacity of 11, including a double berthing, and two extra berths for a maximum capacity of up to eight persons.\n\nA ship of this type was fitted with a 12,500 litres of running water per hour.\n\nIn addition, it had an 18,000 litres of water.\n\nThe ship also had a 7,500 litres of running water. That means it had a capacity of 13,000 litres of running water (more than 14,500 litres of water per hour), and was a light sailing ship.\n\nThe ship had an estimated weight of 7,500 lbs (1,500 kg).\n\nAlso a typical ship of the era was a 4,500 lbs ship. A typical ship is rated at 8,750 lbs (1,000 kg), and a ship of this type is also rated at 16,000 pounds (3,000 kg).\n\nThe ships were delivered on 9 February 1985 and were built in the United States. All the four were purchased by Lighthouse Company (now known as CBA). The vessels were bought in 1987.\n\nIn addition to this, ships were supplied with oil, ammunition, food, provisions, food, and clothing.\n\nThe ships were also provided with a few small provisions such as water, but also many of the other provisions given to them during their construction.\n\nIn addition to the ship, Lighthouse Company acquired the remaining land from the company and in 1988 the company was transferred to Lighthouse America, a major shipbuilder in Kansas who acquired 80% ownership of the ship.\n\nAlso the company had acquired the oil, oil, ammunition, as well as supplies of clothing.\n\nFinally, Lighthouse Company bought the land of the town of St. Andrews, which now has four buildings that are situated on the northeast shore of the Columbia River near the Missouri River and on the Northside of Columbia. The company has now sold the land to a private company named R. A. Baker, who is the General Manager of the business and is in charge of the company.\n\nThere was an agreement between Lighthouse Company and Baker to pay an agreement fee at the company's rate, that Baker would pay Lighthouse's fee to finance the purchase and distribution of the ship.\n\nThe ship in question was named St. Andrews. St. Andrews was located in Missouri, USA.\n\nThe ship was taken from the company the next year. In August 1987 the ship was given the name St Andrews. The ship was then sold to a private entity called R. A. Baker, who owned Lighthouse America.\n\nSt. Andrews was finally bought by the company in 1995. The ship then sailed through various ports and shipping routes. In 1996 the ship was renamed St. Andrews.","token_len":620,"entropy":[8.6648,3.5661,2.6039,10.8805,0.3126,8.8807,3.7344,10.9181,7.9101,2.4994,5.01,4.2367,7.4177,0.0483,0.0651,0.4576,1.3059,1.1929,9.6838,6.3955,0.0314,4.3886,5.33,1.3683,12.0869,11.4218,6.6739,7.4967,5.6048,5.7367,3.5517,12.8089,1.757,0.8775,2.5721,6.4769,1.3857,4.8922,2.1845,1.2909,4.2121,0.9368,5.4605,0.9445,4.2369,0.0665,3.6343,5.9084,0.0677,3.1172,3.2363,2.8941,4.0444,0.0865,5.0945,1.6605,4.6477,1.5517,4.9163,2.1548,2.3718,2.5769,1.8948,2.5255,4.8865,0.1703,0.0412,0.4001,1.1754,0.5333,0.3323,0.0335,7.313,0.0025,4.3835,6.7862,0.3888,1.962,0.0301,3.2473,4.3652,2.0115,1.1605,1.3458,1.1102,4.6502,0.2372,1.1296,5.776,3.875,3.8439,9.8815,3.1416,6.5024,0.1262,3.6942,2.9963,1.5523,1.6899,0.0003,3.6089,2.3009,1.0994,3.3229,1.1562,2.6904,4.2702,1.2548,0.5705,3.1801,0.9313,3.2979,5.2174,0.5786,0.0003,1.3662,1.5791,3.8163,0.3114,0.8083,5.4047,0.5044,1.4458,2.6104,1.0634,0.4964,0.0751,2.2722,7.158,3.308,1.7722,1.4909,1.1143,1.3677,0.1411,4.1594,0.1329,0.9726,0.4468,1.3843,0.0783,0.0327,4.9102,5.6452,0.3218,5.3783,0.495,2.1548,0.5738,1.3184,2.0515,1.1542,0.5385,2.4051,1.5348,2.7176,4.0212,5.6597,5.8537,0.9906,0.7205,0.3587,0.0003,1.3362,1.5304,1.6145,2.5439,4.3486,2.0538,0.1265,3.3812,0.5138,1.9917,3.4031,0.8649,2.7348,0.121,2.5332,0.1515,0.6109,0.4164,0.0002,6.5696,5.1415,5.5858,2.6025,0.985,2.3176,3.2261,0.7555,0.7839,3.5825,1.1062,1.6052,3.3478,4.8483,1.5143,3.5123,3.0642,1.2101,4.6067,5.8213,1.1852,3.37,0.3223,4.8395,0.3259,0.2771,1.6294,0.002,2.4228,0.0187,1.7603,1.2488,1.9396,2.2218,0.7343,0.5824,0.6644,0.7402,5.1682,0.3264,0.1086,3.7394,0.0015,0.9851,5.453,0.0892,2.2039,0.0075,0.9127,0.0231,0.2798,0.3208,0.0002,1.4514,4.4459,1.9542,7.0014,2.5895,5.0223,2.5983,6.8096,2.0737,1.209,3.6136,1.8903,1.7924,3.9726,0.6066,1.193,4.9978,2.0129,5.8035,4.955,6.2947,1.1428,5.9834,4.555,4.77,3.5136,2.7146,4.1623,0.0228,5.3393,7.3008,2.0045,1.975,4.614,0.5661,6.1229,2.3782,5.0301,1.738,0.5073,0.0002,3.3905,2.089,0.5391,4.3684,1.0177,4.9782,1.7838,5.3872,0.5813,6.2639,1.699,5.6357,0.4969,3.4724,0.731,3.8314,0.5243,4.1195,2.0521,2.0959,2.9682,0.5018,0.6604,0.0002,1.5042,2.1828,0.5552,2.0858,3.5827,0.0544,1.9646,5.81,3.5696,4.712,3.0345,0.0019,3.9511,1.3358,5.8378,2.2765,5.3195,5.0152,0.2965,3.9368,3.0005,5.9114,0.7276,3.3254,3.1419,1.4668,3.9891,0.3361,0.4027,0.0002,2.835,0.642,0.7068,1.3701,3.6675,0.8548,3.2198,0.015,0.4066,5.2875,1.8621,4.5635,3.6096,2.8719,0.7281,5.3564,2.7196,4.7792,3.6978,2.1277,1.2468,2.8602,4.2159,0.2279,3.1073,0.1664,7.4486,1.6779,1.909,5.2128,4.3707,1.5819,1.0899,6.2095,5.9634,4.7179,6.6157,0.915,4.2915,0.4428,0.2971,1.975,0.7385,0.6213,0.0002,5.4115,3.1149,2.0967,2.8728,3.2435,1.3291,5.6308,2.949,3.4824,0.8749,2.1654,0.1844,8.0631,0.0136,0.0127,3.22,1.4054,3.6707,2.0664,0.4918,0.0002,5.1973,0.6865,1.7977,0.0037,0.5961,2.9947,1.0809,2.8174,3.0843,1.1672,5.8065,0.1222,4.8472,0.7726,4.8957,0.8164,3.2599,3.8725,1.9722,5.7471,4.2451,3.7262,1.3865,5.0274,1.1099,0.6618,5.97,2.6192,0.2936,0.6631,5.8121,0.0865,3.8679,1.1568,2.6372,0.3095,2.9754,2.7592,0.4472,4.6158,5.4249,0.5719,3.6991,0.9719,2.1313,3.0378,3.0451,4.1034,3.2483,1.0884,0.8237,0.7006,2.3789,2.3649,1.2854,3.1893,5.2531,1.9445,4.0075,0.077,6.465,2.0436,1.2541,1.9874,2.683,7.3026,0.1367,0.3456,0.9188,5.4112,2.5978,2.3932,3.8065,0.2047,0.0113,0.7814,3.4016,1.584,0.3889,0.0002,4.6573,2.0345,3.4866,3.6288,1.422,1.2752,0.0019,0.1959,0.1267,2.872,1.5475,4.2579,3.8633,5.6486,0.7592,5.9253,0.9546,5.8991,0.3423,3.8089,3.398,4.9595,5.7468,1.4336,1.7033,2.133,0.0048,4.1533,5.2987,1.983,8.0199,0.5265,1.822,2.5045,5.2405,0.0297,0.5276,2.3891,0.7416,0.768,0.0003,1.4221,2.3479,5.8006,1.3185,0.5102,3.5275,3.8277,0.1393,0.3103,1.528,4.5413,0.0048,0.1,0.7453,4.5382,1.7222,3.7027,2.271,6.2938,0.7159,0.8804,0.0002,1.3826,1.2266,0.5631,5.2552,1.3424,1.0194,3.4002,5.6454,2.8815,2.1087,1.2142,2.7572,4.0421,2.6782,1.3562,1.4011,0.3141,4.7984,1.877,1.6294,0.9423,3.9703,0.939,2.1554,0.8567,0.4596,3.034,2.6055,0.537,1.9112,0.8886,5.5905,1.1185,3.0538,0.1111,0.2959,0.0212,0.0218,1.3679,0.2955,4.8504,6.4187,0.0061,1.7836,0.9349,0.6754,0.0002,4.0179,0.0224,0.0784,0.7409,5.7709,3.5409,0.613,1.7284,1.6999,0.9653,4.6067,0.8633,1.8519,1.3246,4.1634,3.0443,3.7738,5.2172,2.3204,2.0633,6.7877,2.1588,1.4032,2.8008,2.961,1.1222,0.4984,0.3707,4.192,0.9646,0.1913,1.0982,1.0652]}
{"id":558,"ended":true,"length":603,"text":"Oribe's musical experience began at the age of three when, upon her mother's suggestions, she took private piano lessons. Although she was a shy student in kindergarten, she enjoyed seeing the colors on the piano and realized it was her dream to achieve perfection. \"I would sing to her and say, 'Brahma, bahma-ma, bahma...',\" \"Ach! (Oribe) sang with every song. For years I have sung on the piano at home. It was my chance to see the color and make sense of how my hair fell into my eyes and I kept playing. And it was fun! \"In my twenties I got a taste of the music by the age of 17, when I had the opportunity to sing. I realized that as much as I loved playing piano, I was still learning how to take it to a whole different level of artistic expression. \"So much effort was put into producing, composing and performing. I realized that if I could make my own music, I knew that there would be a more beautiful thing. I also realized that learning to sing was a way to develop a sense of what it means to have good taste, to be able to sing well. At the age of 16, I was playing piano and singing. I just learned how to sing and do well in school.\"\nWith the help of an artist, Oribe began performing at a local school, where she grew up. \"When I wanted to act, I started to write about it. I decided to write something for myself. I was in the beginning when working on my audition at home, and I always felt like I could learn. But then I saw that this wasn't what I was meant to do, and I realized that my talent could be more than just a song, but it also had a musical potential,\" \"Ach!\" added Oribe.\nOribe's first musical experience involved singing. When she began to perform with her siblings, she learned to sing for the first time. Later, she started performing again along with her sister. \"I wanted to do something so exciting and unique. This meant that in the next few years, singing would be my calling. And it wasn't just singing, but singing is the most romantic thing I would ever do in my life, and I always wanted to express that.\"\nNow, Oribe lives in St. Lucie at the moment, and, despite not being a singer, it doesn't disappoint her. \"I love singing.

The first episode featured the most-played episode in the series, \"The Wolf and The Wolf and The Wolf and The Wolf of Wall Street.\"","token_len":621,"entropy":[9.2432,5.0214,9.8173,7.5207,12.3932,2.414,4.0397,7.4844,8.2404,9.3685,5.3022,5.6101,11.3612,2.3702,6.4461,11.5737,7.3619,0.0219,0.9083,0.0085,4.7094,7.7722,1.6452,13.9618,0.0692,5.3336,0.308,1.103,3.8131,0.1918,0.1304,1.9168,3.4015,5.5441,0.4159,1.5372,0.4035,2.2052,0.0882,7.8442,1.345,7.9682,9.3492,2.9415,5.8547,4.3372,2.9581,1.372,2.9759,5.1811,1.1474,2.5216,0.1282,0.0945,6.7365,4.2547,2.213,0.3071,0.3676,0.1671,0.0451,0.5243,0.0271,0.011,6.1511,5.8472,0.3315,2.5192,11.4747,3.2004,3.0944,0.097,6.1836,5.0884,4.9385,3.374,8.4955,3.5232,3.7475,4.7477,1.8776,7.0571,4.3399,7.276,3.8046,4.7741,2.9677,1.76,1.5955,0.6921,0.6769,3.5541,0.2973,1.1446,0.2906,0.165,1.6919,0.7239,0.146,0.1117,0.6134,0.5887,0.0939,0.0861,0.1395,0.4834,0.069,0.0633,0.0586,0.3838,0.0556,0.045,0.017,0.2962,0.0471,0.0252,0.0175,0.2347,0.0401,0.0134,0.0124,0.1948,0.0331,0.0111,0.0069,0.174,0.0265,0.01,0.0046,0.1593,0.0205,0.0089,0.0036,0.1492,0.016,0.0094,0.0032,0.1395,0.0126,0.0098,0.003,0.1333,0.0077,0.0097,0.0029,0.1273,0.0057,0.0092,0.0029,0.1213,0.0052,0.0083,0.0029,0.1172,0.0044,0.0074,0.0029,0.1132,0.0047,0.0067,0.0029,0.1083,0.0054,0.0061,0.0029,0.1034,0.006,0.0057,0.0029,0.0982,0.0059,0.0053,0.0029,0.0929,0.0053,0.005,0.003,0.0894,0.0045,0.0048,0.003,0.0852,0.0038,0.0046,0.003,0.0815,0.0033,0.0045,0.003,0.0784,0.0029,0.0044,0.003,0.0749,0.0027,0.0043,0.0031,0.0725,0.0025,0.0042,0.0031,0.0689,0.0023,0.0042,0.0031,0.0657,0.0021,0.0042,0.0031,0.0621,0.002,0.0041,0.0032,0.0587,0.002,0.0041,0.0032,0.0552,0.0019,0.0041,0.0032,0.0518,0.0018,0.0041,0.0032,0.0482,0.0018,0.0041,0.0032,0.044,0.0018,0.0041,0.0032,0.0414,0.0017,0.0041,0.0032,0.0385,0.0017,0.004,0.0032,0.0365,0.0017,0.004,0.0032,0.0343,0.0017,0.004,0.0033,0.0314,0.0017,0.0041,0.0033,0.0289,0.0017,0.0041,0.0033,0.0279,0.0017,0.0041,0.0033,0.0256,0.0017,0.0041,0.0033,0.0215,0.0018,0.0041,0.0033,7.0895,0.0034,5.6763,0.8424,0.7705,2.8029,0.0003,2.3275,5.8451,6.2483,4.2245,0.5912,0.3292,0.7884,2.9047,2.2487,5.221,5.4277,0.9134,6.7107,3.9098,5.2396,1.4081,0.9865,4.1075,3.82,2.7493,2.3452,1.6608,5.0129,4.0018,0.7454,3.2429,0.9273,5.4887,0.8091,0.0003,2.6363,5.9619,1.9381,5.3545,0.0014,1.5117,2.9308,4.307,2.1375,5.0136,4.1254,4.1948,4.179,1.8484,1.9806,0.0214,1.5492,4.9134,1.3984,1.1642,2.3074,0.0002,5.1726,5.2041,2.8777,3.6514,4.8164,7.785,8.2387,3.8336,1.5458,3.0817,0.0171,0.1101,3.8962,4.3038,3.4438,3.7685,4.8202,2.3745,7.0165,1.5455,0.7448,0.0003,4.0913,2.611,2.5847,2.2485,4.4199,1.7938,5.3256,1.564,2.5718,1.1649,5.6735,6.7775,0.6197,1.1163,0.0002,2.8769,5.1699,3.4167,2.7619,0.2823,1.5841,8.2251,2.9295,1.7651,3.2627,3.3142,4.1356,3.8696,5.191,1.062,0.0013,6.6655,1.1475,4.6265,1.9886,3.0822,2.2117,3.684,2.319,1.9614,6.1242,1.9016,6.1926,2.0021,3.5341,4.6711,0.0697,4.4303,3.6897,1.684,4.3683,3.4792,1.209,0.3948,3.6499,2.352,1.7002,4.7892,2.2549,7.532,2.2417,2.2713,4.742,1.5034,1.7222,4.0002,1.8219,2.5344,0.8561,3.5722,1.0558,3.3977,1.887,3.7438,3.4073,3.6573,2.2465,2.3993,1.4913,2.7829,5.8423,3.7335,1.2696,3.977,4.3433,0.9384,0.6486,0.6278,0.0003,2.7017,3.3134,5.8274,6.0776,2.7352,6.1219,4.4838,0.8503,8.8758,1.567,0.6053,4.6312,0.0002,6.5377,2.8561,0.0002,2.5531,2.9927,2.9164,4.682,1.1932,3.7737,0.1272,0.9307,4.4788,3.5572,0.6796,2.099,1.3632,7.642,0.2656,0.0006,0.0058,1.3302,2.5511,1.6844,6.1019,4.154,0.4645,1.4186,4.5296,5.0541,2.493,0.6386,1.6278,6.6105,0.4115,7.1371,0.0483,2.709,4.4483,3.5062,2.9055,3.2145,0.0248,2.417,0.3291,6.2856,4.2057,6.2285,3.7711,0.498,3.9272,7.1635,2.2084,1.812,2.2487,4.2199,2.7943,5.255,1.5575,5.0782,7.2032,4.0942,1.6344,5.6506,0.9489,0.7885,0.0004,3.9285,0.3437,0.0003,1.5549,4.0297,2.4569,3.9682,1.9183,1.6526,4.9757,0.5459,6.6763,2.204,0.9431,5.0471,4.5128,2.4889,1.3268,4.6934,1.6663,1.8658,1.3008,1.383,0.1741,0.0065,0.0011,0.8543,3.5808,4.7107,3.2833,4.267,4.1592,1.9439,5.4436,6.0392,0.3391,4.2462,2.2888,2.0902,4.8665,2.7601,1.3786,1.8,0.6395,0.5306,2.0008,1.9426,2.0283,3.0224,2.0808,1.2778,2.6926,1.3137,2.3736,0.6424,5.3955,1.0704,0.0638,1.0561,5.0737,2.9869,3.3987,1.0234,1.6323,2.7237,4.6156,0.9423,5.0791,0.7101,2.8662,2.6622,1.4894,3.143,2.5638,2.5551,1.008,2.7749,1.8686,4.9968,3.7414,3.503,1.6681,2.2231,0.521,0.5066,0.9697,1.0554,0.9731,0.8774,4.3373,2.4283,2.1477,4.9538,0.6562,0.162,0.8151,0.386,0.0438,5.1644,0.0547,0.0018,0.744]}
{"id":637,"ended":false,"length":539,"text":"In April 1986 Yankovic entered the recording studio to begin the sessions to his follow @ - @ up to 1985's Dare to Be Stupid. To produce the album, Yankovic brought in three people \u2013 Yankovic himself, his producer, and a DJ named Dave \"The Devil\" Pate \u2013 as his vocalists. The resulting recording of Dare to Be Stupid was quickly picked up by the U.S. Music & Entertainment Commission (USMC) and recorded for Yankovic.\n\nIn 1987, Yankovic was signed to Cineplex.\n\nAt this point, Yankovic was not playing his songs on any live album, he only put out a few CDs and had limited success with live material.\n\nAfter the release of Dare to Be Stupid in 1989 as a demo single to the soundtrack of 'The Devil's Wedding', Yankovic decided to record the full album with a demo tape out of New York City in November 1986 under the pseudonym \"The Devil\".\n\nThe label in question had initially rejected Yankovic's recording because he had wanted a full physical demo and wanted that extra release with a studio performance where the producer or producer were only present for the session and to record the album in a studio environment. To overcome this, Yankovic arranged for a digital CD release, allowing for the production crew as well as the recording engineer to make their way home from work before the tape was played out.\n\nAfter recording their first single 'The Devil's Wedding', featuring Yankovic and his bandmate Mark Ziegler of the band The Devil'n', Cineplex released Dare to Be Stupid in 1990, then a limited edition of the band's full material in September 1988 which was also recorded live at Cineplex.\n\nFollowing their release on Dabbing Records in 1994, Yankovic began recording some of his next songs under his alias Red.\n\nYankovic's first studio record was released 'Dare to Be Stupid' with Paul Williams for the band At The End of The World on 17 September 1994. The label then released 'Fatal Frame' with Joe Haney and Eric Kudrow, who produced the song on behalf of At The End of The World.\n\nThe record is released for US release exclusively on the company's website and through Cineplex. Both songs feature an extensive production staff as well as a guest vocalist. Some of the original vocalists were also featured on the album's soundtrack.\n\nThe CD release of 'Dare to Be Stupid' in 1994 was particularly disappointing for Yankovic, who was at the time living in Los Angeles for his job and was busy making music for the first time.\n\nYankovic himself recently returned home to Jamaica to continue his work with another band The Devil's Wedding, as they toured through the South Florida area in late 1999.\n\nSource | Source \/ Source \/\n\nIn the last several months this music video will be shown over at YouTube, you can see the full video below:","token_len":621,"entropy":[8.0569,6.8274,9.6561,4.6414,0.975,6.1393,0.6168,8.1946,0.7823,1.9397,4.2225,2.5639,6.1484,5.0471,3.3633,4.97,13.2175,8.0683,5.0312,8.883,2.9703,9.2019,2.1387,11.1259,3.18,2.6516,5.4736,0.8816,5.8792,7.4543,1.2699,1.6011,0.9074,0.9407,0.0046,0.0006,5.8542,2.1763,4.976,4.5615,3.8589,4.9395,1.0338,0.1221,2.5516,0.7757,3.9231,2.7266,1.6409,0.3873,2.4699,5.4378,1.0895,4.5073,5.1287,2.4585,5.358,0.2581,5.2953,5.126,2.3123,2.9034,3.8025,4.0223,0.8695,0.4047,1.7723,5.1084,3.7227,2.5833,1.2812,0.2676,0.0271,0.0042,1.2317,6.4455,3.6631,0.0211,0.1707,1.8788,5.3056,0.1204,0.1992,0.0118,3.4758,4.0429,2.2116,1.539,1.3211,1.0533,2.2209,0.4594,0.6596,4.8413,2.21,5.4982,0.0139,0.0015,3.8477,1.629,0.0014,2.5237,2.6631,1.1836,0.7583,0.0041,0.0009,2.594,3.9172,0.3815,6.1911,3.0468,2.2218,3.7461,3.3584,0.0002,4.3081,1.7635,0.5585,0.597,1.272,0.01,0.0017,1.1649,4.1075,4.5454,3.4243,4.318,1.7323,3.1325,4.7104,4.1986,1.6132,4.0174,2.9471,6.1326,1.1126,1.8801,1.6732,6.1835,1.7892,3.393,5.0353,4.5347,1.0547,4.3957,4.9145,0.4191,2.0627,0.0001,3.7752,1.9285,2.1478,0.0189,1.0097,0.0212,0.0112,0.001,2.2702,2.5465,7.2378,1.2429,4.8303,4.0693,4.8545,2.2894,5.9722,1.1341,4.1306,2.2826,3.8434,0.8332,6.3898,0.6418,0.6867,0.0118,0.0016,3.2492,0.1565,3.3752,2.3315,3.7811,1.3403,2.2157,2.5184,4.6865,1.9611,5.6406,0.8294,7.2465,0.3883,1.7076,2.8153,4.3762,4.5033,6.4664,0.3538,2.6375,1.7898,2.6683,1.4693,1.0929,1.0476,0.0001,2.1923,5.4296,4.9891,2.6173,3.2174,5.4582,4.6743,2.4186,0.0054,0.0005,0.2118,5.0407,3.8611,1.7475,2.0629,6.4611,2.5065,4.1748,7.599,4.4656,4.1054,3.7899,6.055,6.1728,6.4148,4.8084,1.8038,5.6142,6.7328,5.7403,1.9317,3.7107,5.6947,2.5027,5.293,4.8807,2.575,3.01,1.2633,4.35,2.8174,5.08,2.1136,0.7105,2.1154,2.7904,1.63,2.4749,3.966,0.4312,5.3471,5.6519,0.4518,0.6249,1.0957,0.0054,0.0007,5.2934,0.6161,1.3447,6.0888,5.1593,3.035,3.3746,6.3217,2.8863,1.4147,3.0669,4.285,6.5131,0.6139,0.0358,1.2442,2.242,1.9644,0.3466,4.478,3.4516,4.2562,5.6732,1.8536,2.0348,4.7665,0.8806,3.5623,0.44,3.5946,3.9264,0.5492,0.4542,0.0001,3.2737,3.1491,4.0947,1.5569,2.484,2.364,2.5118,1.07,0.199,0.0921,0.6803,7.4866,1.9971,0.0179,0.0012,2.4102,1.9734,2.5184,3.9364,5.3113,5.2037,4.4092,0.0107,5.6611,1.7493,3.2246,2.7564,2.4316,7.5149,5.6425,3.1065,5.4447,0.0089,0.0023,1.5111,3.2331,0.04,0.0594,0.0011,2.2416,3.6165,2.3469,5.2405,3.6902,4.2111,1.0964,3.552,2.4607,5.8265,0.379,4.8535,6.2955,2.911,5.2808,6.4305,5.3693,1.3493,3.3816,3.6873,3.1483,2.2824,2.4954,0.0038,0.0017,0.7809,0.5597,0.0001,3.7439,2.7043,2.1607,2.0717,6.6951,6.1714,4.854,6.5729,0.9542,2.8508,0.2817,0.953,0.0043,0.0011,3.1195,2.1011,4.7782,1.0713,0.502,5.23,2.9584,3.108,2.4547,3.5574,7.2698,4.0367,1.5059,0.0001,2.9621,0.028,0.0029,1.8001,1.7314,3.6772,3.6239,1.3839,2.643,5.7191,3.7591,0.5326,0.3746,0.0786,0.0206,0.7607,3.301,4.5189,5.1275,4.9378,1.6363,3.1535,6.7774,2.1385,2.9968,1.4154,1.8899,1.7036,2.7207,6.1128,2.9178,1.8682,0.4366,1.8983,6.0806,2.8223,1.7416,2.4128,5.0198,4.2162,6.2876,0.4267,1.449,5.3455,5.1626,4.264,1.9191,5.3759,4.6055,6.8868,1.2029,2.5473,2.791,4.9295,0.7948,2.9924,2.5357,4.2792,0.0075,5.9974,0.0205,0.0398,2.0193,0.0743,0.004,0.5959,0.6948,0.0001,2.6072,3.4477,4.0934,4.758,4.2808,5.5017,3.6874,6.2158,0.5303,2.4407,6.133,0.1666,1.3286,2.3215,5.0392,4.7542,0.008,0.0028,1.6236,7.6841,3.3115,2.8012,3.8725,5.7181,4.2081,3.6324,3.952,0.1163,0.0099,1.6427,4.6713,0.9225,0.0327,1.1858,6.2251,0.4394,0.2468,4.4605,3.3538,0.3596,2.6525,1.232,2.0709,0.7828,0.5114,1.128,2.805,3.3355,1.0385,0.3884,0.0001,2.1589,5.8281,0.9281,0.9323,1.928,1.3503,0.0032,0.2098,0.0081,0.001,0.071,3.6891,3.1964,1.2357,7.8127,5.2251,2.1134,0.8301,0.0034,0.0011,1.641,1.1855,1.8477,5.5475,0.6613,0.2455,5.7678,0.3556,2.7886,0.0044,4.4084,1.578,4.6283,3.7218,1.9855,5.1031,3.5467,2.1641,1.1761,1.6692,4.5043,0.1525,0.6613,1.3983,0.0001,2.1293,0.0148,0.0014,6.1028,6.4558,4.906,2.8788,0.9672,7.0927,1.8009,4.3593,1.4355,2.8312,1.5632,5.9527,1.2178,5.682,0.6474,0.7071,0.2603,1.6374,3.9307,3.3878,4.195,4.6631,1.0517,5.9872,4.9084,0.8613,2.5274,3.132,4.5925,0.7035,0.6824,0.0001,5.6293,5.3895,2.3953,5.6074,3.5995,2.0253,4.0696,0.0002,5.7037,2.848,5.1812,5.4508,1.7701,6.8121,5.2589,2.6894,5.528,0.5414,3.9132,4.7951,1.7159,3.5694,2.4607,4.8428,0.1269,2.5108,1.4465,2.194,0.9944,2.1484,1.6151]}
{"id":1030,"ended":true,"length":556,"text":"At daylight on 10 August, strong patrols went forward and remained in touch with the force at Bir el Abd throughout the day, but without fresh troops, an attack in force could have been deadly, the British Army statement reads.\n\nThe presence of around 2,000 troops has brought the attack, which began a two week battle between the two forces, to a halt as well as increasing the presence of 1,000 cavalry troops at the base of the village.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, around 40 soldiers were deployed at the base of the village.\n\nThe British Army statement said: \u201cThis attack was carried out with assistance from the cavalry battalion as part of a comprehensive force which was comprised of approximately 1,500 troops who had been sent on a training mission in January as part of Operation Shazani.\u201d\n\nSaying: \u201cThis was an unprecedented attack on the whole British army. While we have every confidence in the force and its ability to respond, and understand our enemy in detail, both sides were prepared and focused all their attacks on specific sites.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything in our power to bring them to their own place of peace, but we must also respect the security and stability of the community, as well as support and ensure that our forces remain protected.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile as well as the attack, the British forces also were forced to leave the village after they experienced heavy fire from a close range fighter plane on 3 February, which left one of the forces dead, and one killed.\n\nIt added: \u201cIt was imperative to prepare the forces to attack both sides in accordance with UN peacekeeping orders.\u201d\n\nAt 5.15am, the Balfour Declaration and the Geneva Non-Proliferation Treaty (GEN) also signed into law.\n\nThe treaty guarantees to members of the Security Council all access to the \u201cUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals\u201d, which the UN defines as \u201cthe goals of the Millennium Development Goals\u201d, \u201cthe goals of the United Nations Development Program and any other global development policy, as well as the provision of humanitarian relief, assistance and investment as well as the participation of political parties during any UN General Assembly, including the United Nations\u201d.\n\nIt was an unprecedented attack on the whole British army. While we have every confidence in the force and its ability to respond, and understand our enemy in detail, both sides were prepared and focused all their attacks on specific sites.\n\nWe will do everything in our power to bring them to their own place of peace, but we must also respect the security and stability of the community, as well as support and maintain our forces in the field.\n\nBritish forces also made their return from the village to the main barracks in Rotherham, by 3.30am on 24 January, which was an hour late as the attacks had started and completed the operation. The British forces returned via a heavy fire attack and had the last of their combat mission in Ramsey at 3pm.","token_len":621,"entropy":[11.9833,2.8228,6.2855,2.8488,1.5412,10.7168,11.9036,5.8465,5.1967,2.5315,7.3102,1.8878,4.6549,0.475,0.9001,6.4782,3.2727,6.9267,8.9779,8.8381,12.8572,0.2092,1.2398,1.8789,3.2527,5.98,9.0037,4.2783,2.0802,5.7472,2.768,5.0321,6.2148,4.3854,3.0415,0.8485,7.2874,2.7136,3.4177,3.823,3.9516,7.4236,3.2549,0.0625,0.4762,0.0007,1.832,5.6601,0.0641,6.0676,3.4817,0.0342,0.3946,1.8078,4.6044,4.7555,1.5459,5.244,4.9002,0.7099,2.4019,4.774,5.6727,3.2477,4.074,3.6853,0.729,2.6845,2.7888,0.5595,0.7412,0.8809,1.9165,4.3343,4.6364,0.3998,5.1949,2.4479,6.0047,0.0506,5.3137,0.0154,0.7279,6.908,2.7034,3.179,2.2683,2.8126,1.7481,0.6897,5.7292,0.8445,0.3482,0.0003,3.8795,3.9622,2.537,0.4547,4.4985,3.7497,3.3367,1.6475,4.2616,2.191,1.657,1.275,1.8117,2.6198,0.705,2.3668,1.0965,0.0002,1.6158,1.7696,0.8317,1.937,2.011,0.9302,11.1994,6.9466,5.4621,2.8673,1.6585,2.362,0.002,2.2213,6.7007,0.5123,0.7824,5.2862,5.0806,5.8185,1.963,0.0007,1.5956,5.6221,6.4429,5.2118,1.9653,4.9656,0.0934,3.9108,2.4451,0.0084,1.9742,1.8584,3.8276,2.18,1.0154,3.0242,3.4142,1.3288,4.1417,0.6717,2.0861,6.3478,5.9129,0.2213,0.001,1.6338,5.9659,5.5822,9.6565,0.9516,4.7497,6.7104,0.6865,0.0001,6.5525,5.155,2.0589,0.28,0.8847,2.7294,2.0676,1.4823,4.1308,1.5959,1.4745,1.2696,6.8564,2.649,2.283,1.811,5.081,2.4902,1.8667,6.4757,0.4677,0.9578,0.6886,4.3568,1.8474,1.6302,2.3817,0.1666,3.0066,2.2934,4.2406,5.8073,3.1633,3.6287,6.2666,5.9893,0.3316,6.9245,2.0806,3.4765,3.8901,2.4829,6.4206,6.452,4.7263,6.0836,1.0913,6.6543,4.8061,1.7014,1.4634,0.0002,1.2536,0.884,2.1051,2.4391,4.1901,0.5807,1.4155,0.0254,0.0075,0.0756,3.872,4.2099,0.8789,2.298,4.571,5.038,1.0151,6.0986,1.8507,2.5082,1.2751,2.1857,1.7221,4.5305,1.0149,4.5957,2.027,3.4107,0.1614,0.9603,4.2266,2.5411,2.6693,0.7033,0.0151,6.6365,2.9043,4.3224,0.8169,2.4495,1.3703,2.3315,5.5985,1.5538,1.617,0.5865,0.2073,0.0001,4.928,6.8776,3.0298,0.0869,1.1318,3.1877,1.2424,1.1891,1.4016,4.0401,2.6167,5.5645,4.8969,0.0929,3.844,1.209,1.4503,2.3402,4.3042,5.8686,2.3628,3.542,1.55,2.7949,6.698,1.7253,6.2112,3.1863,3.8766,5.717,2.9711,2.1823,2.2229,3.1097,2.7043,1.7312,0.7778,5.2052,1.5545,2.2611,2.0555,3.848,4.6688,1.1262,0.2521,0.0002,4.2778,4.4127,0.3068,0.0384,0.1891,3.6309,1.4346,5.8872,2.2965,6.2308,1.9116,2.6601,1.5535,4.054,5.7623,1.4701,2.4028,5.3563,0.0321,6.6135,5.005,0.2439,3.9374,1.1559,1.4886,0.2471,0.225,0.0002,4.8366,4.5846,0.7866,2.6336,1.9015,1.6659,1.5605,5.6196,5.3374,0.001,0.6778,3.9109,1.2437,7.5671,7.9528,0.0985,0.3607,0.0004,0.001,0.2261,2.383,8.5077,3.993,5.7567,2.4277,3.7175,2.3772,1.617,0.5717,0.0002,1.2102,4.1541,4.5502,5.1558,6.7156,0.9723,0.2612,3.0775,0.0036,4.7591,4.6188,0.0934,1.2503,12.2616,2.327,2.3122,0.0763,8.4657,0.2093,0.3636,3.6819,0.6322,3.2683,1.8911,3.2487,1.5662,6.9418,0.1442,4.1086,1.1772,1.512,4.8407,0.8306,2.0101,5.963,0.0105,0.154,2.8434,0.2503,2.4699,6.7647,0.0457,1.9254,5.5384,0.4207,1.1578,2.5206,0.0096,2.8791,1.5886,1.8598,5.0343,1.0227,4.6313,1.4619,4.4551,2.6651,2.7625,0.378,0.002,1.2559,6.4694,0.263,2.0364,3.427,1.196,3.1768,0.768,4.2488,6.0992,0.7502,0.0045,1.7382,5.4198,0.4552,5.0389,1.7461,6.8107,3.8708,4.5918,3.8562,0.0028,3.381,2.7032,1.2727,1.0452,0.0864,10.8526,0.2425,0.362,0.2582,0.0002,3.1636,3.284,4.6766,2.8198,1.485,0.1731,0.105,0.1025,0.0584,0.0639,0.519,1.2777,0.0355,0.0095,0.0024,0.0184,0.0143,0.0046,0.0019,0.0038,0.0008,0.0113,0.0008,0.001,0.0049,0.02,0.0071,0.008,0.0019,0.0032,0.0005,0.0013,0.0021,0.0024,0.001,0.0009,0.0033,0.0075,0.0017,0.0007,0.0014,0.0023,0.0044,0.0179,0.0783,0.4922,0.0001,3.8569,0.9568,0.2998,0.0206,0.0023,0.0012,0.001,0.0134,0.0041,0.0081,0.0036,0.0016,0.0028,0.0033,0.001,0.0008,0.0264,0.0014,0.0149,0.0022,0.0022,0.0021,0.003,0.0026,0.0004,0.0005,0.0008,0.0035,0.0012,0.0165,0.0012,0.0007,0.0008,0.0028,0.0009,8.8696,7.3488,0.0162,6.0794,1.9946,1.7676,0.4382,0.594,0.0001,6.1648,1.2341,3.6754,4.2012,2.7711,4.1259,1.8403,1.1103,2.2977,2.958,1.5235,4.6103,5.4628,1.9906,5.5791,2.6437,0.0468,1.5915,6.1981,5.2957,0.7933,0.5982,0.8512,1.6157,4.3148,3.6091,1.4215,3.7612,1.9602,4.7565,2.6978,4.2248,3.2584,1.417,6.5502,2.1444,2.7331,2.7675,8.8261,2.7248,3.6989,0.4811,3.5701,1.8773,1.5867,4.2294,5.3122,2.0896,5.7301,5.3995,4.0708,3.3299,4.2838,4.2596,4.1483,3.3204,0.518,5.6133,8.2102,2.3394,13.4786,4.0019,2.5627,2.3903,0.9818]}

Kuller.\n\n\"What is the power of this mindset? What is its purpose, if it is not to be feared, it is to be understood and respected as a source of wisdom and hope. To understand this, we need to have the conviction in our minds that this is the only way to live to our greatest potential.\" Peter Kuller, \"Singing a Reminder to the Belated Mindset\", The Book of Commonalities (London), 1984\n\n\"The Mindset is that powerful and transformative form of perception where our minds may have been invented. That is the mindset that brings life into words, where we discover that life can be lived and understood only through the mindset and to that end, where life is always the most precious gift and the most precious thing. Our lives exist only through the mindset. It is in the mindset that our most precious gifts are heard. If it is possible, then this ability to feel that nothing is out of control, that everything is just a matter of time, that this being is not only alive to its best potential, that we can see the world through the eyes of the mindset, and that we can live freely without fear or worry. If we can act positively, positively positively and happily, we can see God more clearly than if we fear and worry.\" John C. Clarke, \"The Mindset\", The New York Times (London): 1982\n\n\"It is no wonder, then, that the mindset of the mind can bring the best of everything to a close. It is no wonder, then, that the mindset is the best of all; it can be loved in its entirety. In the mindset, love flows, passion flows, imagination flows, imagination flows through the mindset. It is no wonder that love can change, and that life can be understood and expressed in its fullest power. It is no wonder that we find ourselves surrounded by a mind that is only a tiny part of a whole. That is not an isolated case. This is a whole of everything. And that is what it is. That is what it is that is. And that is what it is that is. In the mindset, we have that power.\" John C.

The dry period may result in an increasing amount of precipitation which leads to flooding and flooding, and also a decrease in sea level.","token_len":622,"entropy":[7.5906,10.5353,4.265,0.0092,3.3699,3.9737,2.1624,3.8195,4.1722,2.4072,3.8389,8.0188,6.8167,10.2324,3.0714,2.5545,3.4043,7.4818,2.6286,2.8713,11.9945,6.5591,7.8547,9.5445,3.4865,6.1205,3.2757,4.8529,5.4589,9.3858,1.3412,0.1108,2.818,11.8939,6.4784,3.7003,3.6748,6.917,5.888,9.8224,2.6785,7.8614,5.1625,6.9404,4.5739,5.2269,1.1663,4.1689,0.8231,3.6492,4.0194,5.6325,2.7564,4.2084,6.003,1.4924,5.1482,4.6686,4.5987,5.1646,0.1684,3.8895,1.2609,0.6724,0.3037,3.3459,0.3819,0.3752,1.68,4.4644,4.4296,5.6765,6.3662,7.1689,0.0398,0.9212,5.853,2.6814,5.1595,3.6868,0.6521,4.1865,0.69,3.8601,1.7063,4.2711,1.1705,5.2958,1.9591,2.1252,6.0577,4.2389,0.3401,1.8626,4.8094,0.0116,1.0794,1.2979,3.1943,8.2602,2.484,2.1959,3.0108,4.0241,3.419,0.1386,0.0373,2.0683,2.0948,1.2933,5.3187,0.506,0.7265,3.4399,3.017,3.7119,1.1756,0.4667,2.53,0.0194,2.9299,3.3952,0.0617,0.0039,7.1724,0.0004,5.182,2.4051,2.4296,1.1403,6.0015,0.3959,0.2191,3.0229,0.04,0.1219,2.6949,0.7818,5.8278,0.8614,6.1591,1.9315,4.6302,6.3307,1.3129,3.9556,4.7353,1.527,2.3913,0.0002,1.5072,5.6733,0.1071,6.4708,2.5934,1.5159,6.8876,5.0657,0.216,4.9405,0.0277,4.5288,4.011,0.955,0.3399,6.7315,0.4936,2.778,1.621,1.0931,4.1069,0.9908,5.4071,0.008,3.329,2.1617,1.1961,0.3834,0.0061,7.3137,0.4895,1.3149,0.0524,3.6605,0.2467,5.9066,0.6753,1.3021,1.1674,1.5059,4.4142,0.0212,5.034,0.4459,2.3699,0.0003,1.0943,1.4644,4.6704,0.0972,1.1662,1.2618,0.0106,2.5724,0.8973,5.3004,3.0281,0.0016,3.1644,5.3309,3.346,2.3658,0.9953,2.7167,0.0063,2.2232,1.565,0.585,0.8803,0.0002,2.5632,1.3023,2.666,1.0888,0.0002,5.8161,3.9017,2.8307,1.4556,0.72,0.2167,0.0105,2.172,0.3192,4.0163,1.76,1.2556,2.533,0.5055,0.5769,0.0037,5.2,0.057,0.8738,0.1971,5.0083,7.9223,0.9882,1.4008,5.8326,2.9009,0.6292,1.5065,0.0076,4.5327,5.3122,5.2624,1.5349,1.3742,2.9609,7.6391,1.4407,0.1145,0.457,0.9071,0.0002,1.3191,0.5315,0.9014,4.1855,4.9472,0.0002,0.9775,1.5936,0.8438,0.5202,0.1035,0.1434,0.0124,0.5126,0.0472,0.7789,0.0386,0.0148,0.0418,0.0093,0.0055,0.001,7.2251,6.0799,3.3083,1.2663,0.5666,0.0258,0.0011,2.2026,0.8185,0.0292,0.1336,0.2526,0.0242,0.0006,0.2474,0.1349,0.0071,0.1018,0.0193,0.0091,0.0005,0.0759,0.0459,0.0038,0.0591,0.006,0.0057,0.0006,0.0355,0.0167,0.0024,0.0381,0.0039,0.0048,0.0006,0.0088,0.0077,0.0019,0.0277,0.0034,0.0047,0.0006,0.0082,0.005,0.0017,0.0217,0.003,0.005,0.0007,0.0118,0.0038,0.0015,0.0177,0.0028,0.0055,0.0008,0.01,0.0031,0.0014,0.015,0.0026,0.006,0.0009,0.0076,0.0027,0.0014,0.0131,0.0025,0.0065,0.001,0.0063,0.0024,0.0013,0.0117,0.0023,0.007,0.001,0.0056,0.0022,0.0013,0.0107,0.0022,10.7387,1.0326,3.6413,0.1555,0.136,0.4232,4.5688,0.5546,2.1891,0.0034,0.1168,0.0243,0.0062,0.1631,0.6946,6.584,3.0886,0.0006,2.8518,2.6369,0.3725,2.5993,0.3604,0.3047,0.7528,0.9131,1.2005,0.0001,0.2584,3.4768,6.7722,0.8951,1.7349,0.0002,1.2697,0.3973,0.6835,0.986,0.1202,0.0001,0.1965,0.1571,0.0324,0.0295,0.0064,10.82,2.8871,0.2548,1.0277,0.0019,6.4057,5.9078,2.0391,0.7588,0.0001,1.7843,4.719,0.6303,0.2137,0.0055,0.6859,0.1059,0.2908,1.0666,8.5227,1.6864,0.7124,3.0503,0.6697,4.7101,7.1544,0.9337,1.2901,3.1883,0.1108,0.5318,0.6202,0.0002,0.6878,0.235,1.4506,0.0102,1.2256,0.0723,0.0001,0.1372,0.0528,0.0211,0.1146,0.0129,2.6647,0.0058,0.2102,0.032,1.3264,0.1365,0.0689,0.0824,0.0199,0.0287,0.0014,4.7476,5.2519,0.3997,0.2429,0.0001,1.0903,0.5954,0.0948,4.2333,0.0604,0.348,0.0379,0.0567,1.8977,0.0106,1.2362,0.3439,0.379,0.0037,0.2151,0.0334,0.1313,0.1727,0.0002,0.4847,0.0524,1.6651,0.0079,0.5924,0.057,0.0001,0.062,0.0324,0.0057,0.0451,0.0047,0.8217,0.0056,0.0542,0.0245,0.5493,0.0882,0.0182,0.0706,0.1491,0.0741,0.0023,2.2659,3.0097,0.0431,0.085,0.0002,0.4684,0.208,0.0364,0.8858,0.0036,0.0158,0.0046,0.0034,0.9662,0.0057,0.2126,0.0339,0.1744,0.0012,0.0057,0.0077,0.0228,0.1391,0.0002,0.3228,0.0247,10.3622,4.0348,0.5273,0.0002,2.5753,0.3329,0.5545,0.0149,2.9428,0.3462,1.9937,0.9341,4.2645,5.3472,1.5072,1.2688,3.0335,5.0217,5.1309,3.8474,4.3834,1.4954,1.4731,1.1994,2.6009,1.0967,0.1902,1.0721,2.3545,2.9203,1.3131,4.788,0.2112,0.7668,4.3871,2.0572,0.0471,5.4028,4.0212,0.1827,0.3741,7.9376,2.5905,4.0456,3.7694,5.8845,7.5248,4.1079,5.7902,4.8956,1.8296,1.7916,2.7285,0.6347,3.6316,5.4529,0.6315,3.5703,4.1101,1.8493,0.0016,1.7899,5.4318,5.0496,0.0214,3.7508,1.2362,3.2896,3.1253,2.0409,2.7288,3.0399,1.8639,0.0396,3.8278,0.2902,0.577]}
{"id":1088,"ended":true,"length":560,"text":"The modern family is commonly thought to have originated in the 1830s : courtship became more open, marriages were often based on affection, and parents devoted more attention to children. At the same time, the French were more committed to female roleplaying, so women who were able to engage in such roles, usually found husbands who could show off their good-looks.\n\nIn the 1860s, there was a strong cultural shift towards male roleplay (i.e. the dominance of women), thus, many young parents were looking to get back at their female relatives for having little interest in female roleplaying. In 1863, it was published in the French newspaper Des Des Journaux (\u201cThe House of Wulfen\u201d).\n\nIn the 1880 edition of the Les Etudes des Marcheses, a magazine published in France, a young couple was described as \u201cskeletons\u201d. They were described as \u201ccreature lovers\u201d, who liked animals and had always been curious about where they lived.\n\nThey later learned that the wife was an actress, that she wanted to appear in a movie and, therefore, they could see the resemblance between the husband and the wife. At the age of 16, she became engaged to Henry VI. After their marriage, the couple went to Mexico in 1887, where they lived until they decided to go to England.\n\nIn 1901, the couple moved to New York where they lived for about one year until they were divorced in 1908.\n\nThe couple also wrote of the difficulty in establishing families with young children. The couple was convinced that they couldn\u2019t have children (as long as the man loved them). In 1913, they were able to establish a family by following a simple structure.\n\nThere had also been rumours that this couple might have suffered some losses during the war. They were married in 1906 and had one child. This was not the case. Their grandson, Albert, died of cancer in 1906 and their daughter Albert married a German-born British businessman.\n\nThe couple lived to become grandparents. They gave their children up at that age in the same year which led to the passage of immigration legislation at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nAncestry\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard E. Williams, C.C. is a Professor at Saint Mary\u2019s University, St. John\u2019s, Ireland, specializing in the family history of Irish and British families and institutions. His research interests include, among others in the history of family research, the use of genealogy to inform public opinion, and the use of genetic research to create new evidence about the ancestral ties shared in Ireland and England.\n\nHis book, The Irish Family, was published in the USA in 1977 with two chapters under the title Irish Family: a Complete Biographical Report by Professor Edward K. Thompson about the life and career of Henry VI. The biography of the couple and their early relationships, and his comments on research techniques are well worth reading.","token_len":622,"entropy":[8.5543,6.1865,1.3792,9.3255,2.8394,1.044,1.4887,3.9236,0.8523,1.4837,7.5948,0.0983,11.9679,9.781,0.8564,4.7222,2.4855,5.7573,2.3261,4.6284,1.4101,3.55,4.2397,0.4493,5.142,0.9381,0.5635,4.5632,7.1684,2.0742,2.5507,0.0613,3.0664,1.3497,5.0506,0.6256,0.7272,0.0022,0.234,1.6916,5.7896,2.8988,4.1309,5.5272,0.1043,6.1474,3.9619,5.6425,1.3286,3.5761,3.3224,3.7123,1.7549,4.7035,0.0478,5.1841,0.2896,4.4265,2.1775,4.0508,5.2251,4.3958,5.5495,1.1858,2.6178,5.5388,2.7315,0.33,5.7516,4.1823,5.2539,2.1023,1.1185,1.67,0.1376,2.5599,1.4949,4.1465,0.013,0.4004,3.851,0.6413,0.6175,4.5457,4.5364,1.423,2.315,3.1072,1.5268,2.3831,4.1052,4.2102,0.0027,0.0005,1.2585,2.032,5.7431,0.0699,1.5253,2.1632,5.9012,3.8119,4.2808,3.3655,7.3917,2.2315,4.3999,1.7687,3.9526,3.906,1.9089,1.4159,3.7022,4.4261,3.2639,4.791,5.6504,2.7272,0.0483,3.9544,1.4229,0.6001,0.3595,2.4657,6.1531,0.181,4.5492,0.3367,5.9631,1.5953,0.9652,3.341,3.2543,4.9239,6.6676,5.112,2.1071,0.9752,2.1927,11.0232,6.9799,4.4835,6.5607,0.3604,5.5359,5.8042,3.0749,6.113,6.6293,1.6298,2.0531,0.0002,2.1089,1.4396,2.5538,11.9515,0.4532,1.0479,6.9587,6.2035,0.8398,3.6861,5.1172,1.4907,9.163,1.1842,2.786,4.6261,2.2302,0.9198,1.4945,0.5016,2.262,2.3843,3.8127,2.8744,4.8145,0.1968,12.5785,1.235,4.9789,5.7727,1.523,0.0111,2.3314,1.5029,1.6559,2.6496,0.9157,2.343,0.1151,2.5266,0.0541,7.8523,2.5681,8.2752,0.2311,0.0389,1.7243,2.4265,4.1908,5.6727,1.0703,3.1599,5.062,1.5285,4.2801,0.1801,7.1765,1.8043,1.4871,0.3751,1.7521,0.0002,5.1746,5.4432,4.9489,0.4912,2.0825,5.9526,1.7719,3.2808,4.1751,1.1036,4.7011,1.0834,4.2266,0.2618,4.0623,0.6756,1.8124,1.6818,2.2731,4.0813,3.3812,0.0125,2.5753,4.3374,5.1558,2.0465,6.4932,0.8448,1.41,3.9084,0.0882,0.8775,0.9912,0.7145,5.0385,0.7336,3.0121,0.0041,2.9716,0.2117,3.6988,2.2768,4.7685,0.2732,7.5235,3.8454,1.2845,4.0907,3.7084,0.8502,0.2717,1.5154,0.4239,2.9292,0.8164,7.0627,3.9008,1.0586,3.1092,1.4409,1.161,0.4419,2.7018,1.9653,1.7202,5.0422,0.3614,2.956,1.3347,3.2715,0.8385,1.0202,0.0002,1.845,4.8472,0.1531,1.5383,4.0911,2.0419,0.3013,3.4704,0.129,2.7137,0.3415,2.6166,1.6422,3.4015,4.2756,0.1155,2.2011,0.4755,2.3839,2.8644,0.8484,3.6789,0.2093,1.2696,0.0002,2.296,2.9517,4.2301,5.0178,4.3776,2.3105,5.0433,2.3235,5.2973,5.8884,2.9357,4.0969,1.0894,1.2209,2.4917,2.2892,3.446,5.199,0.2592,1.9819,4.2397,9.7233,9.1107,0.1983,2.7387,1.1101,5.3234,3.4782,4.5166,0.0339,2.0937,6.2076,6.71,0.4607,1.2928,2.8866,4.0517,0.1449,2.0264,2.6413,3.1355,0.0467,3.0736,0.5116,1.6571,2.5569,6.0318,1.8064,3.0196,5.6868,1.3663,1.5662,0.0002,4.6645,4.349,4.1208,0.0357,6.369,0.758,4.8712,3.1104,3.224,1.3684,5.3173,3.9296,4.9454,2.6768,1.0885,0.9598,1.0115,2.9276,1.6426,4.4976,0.838,5.3612,1.4788,1.5051,3.645,0.5159,2.344,4.3733,1.4428,2.6839,2.1245,0.3804,1.0982,3.8855,6.7767,1.0591,4.8343,0.8215,2.6081,2.4072,2.0012,0.3184,3.8216,2.0802,2.2115,1.4797,6.3202,7.1602,2.5405,3.0842,3.6163,0.4806,5.0355,4.7185,1.4498,1.0116,0.0003,1.853,1.4768,3.4713,4.8261,3.1999,4.2989,1.7155,2.2844,4.6196,2.2982,1.2596,3.5454,5.0084,5.9791,1.686,3.6234,4.0202,3.8674,2.2079,5.1283,5.7975,0.1346,0.8854,5.9948,0.0654,7.8078,2.165,5.49,0.2611,2.5336,0.0032,0.7609,2.1942,0.0083,0.2113,0.7317,0.0003,5.6177,2.5058,0.2118,1.206,0.0002,7.0893,2.2371,6.229,0.9663,0.0003,4.6239,4.5897,0.3963,5.469,2.5132,5.9932,0.7173,3.9111,0.5075,2.843,0.8828,3.0484,2.6061,5.8794,1.8474,11.2469,3.7981,4.3381,0.7182,1.5276,4.7556,0.5137,3.1298,0.5877,0.5014,0.3063,1.2003,2.2724,1.2574,4.2069,0.0216,1.714,2.9345,3.0939,0.2336,1.9129,2.9959,1.9394,3.2592,2.6236,6.2569,0.311,2.3265,1.5826,1.4234,0.6024,4.6972,2.2823,0.4595,8.1482,1.229,1.7715,0.1014,2.7431,6.9805,0.6209,1.7009,5.8552,0.0254,4.7269,1.5828,2.3731,4.0602,3.822,3.0305,0.7493,1.0145,0.9724,3.4368,0.006,3.3304,1.9264,0.7897,4.8927,2.3855,4.2923,2.2418,1.3058,5.6982,5.5317,7.7229,4.2626,3.4492,0.8715,2.1136,0.163,1.2979,0.0002,3.2611,3.2092,1.1302,1.3513,2.2603,1.3655,0.9308,1.8012,0.4698,0.4661,2.7819,5.0923,0.4428,4.6966,4.3987,5.2912,2.8565,5.8353,0.8293,0.2921,4.3401,1.499,1.9782,4.6114,6.177,3.9316,2.8891,5.5739,2.5619,3.5183,6.0104,5.7001,0.6488,6.341,7.6436,0.4771,3.5209,0.9451,3.3552,0.0287,3.9842,1.6275,1.0823,2.0874,5.6506,2.5446,1.2763,4.7137,3.8867,0.7796,5.6191,4.2676,2.909,3.1579,4.7756,4.4918,0.4182,5.5438,5.166,4.7378,5.1702,0.6432,0.457,0.2208]}
{"id":4895,"ended":true,"length":551,"text":"Smithfield is London's only major wholesale market ( Leadenhall Market nowadays attracting more tourist trade ) which has escaped relocation out of central London to cheaper land, better transport links and more modern facilities have been on the agenda of the government.\n\nThe new 'Crown' is the biggest development in the city and is a complete turnaround off of the previous 'Centre' which only added 10,000 hectares (23,000 acres) of industrial land (it was not a total change).\n\nBut, if everything goes as planned, the Crown is set to become the largest trading hub in the world.\n\nIt makes it one of the world's only two industrial centres with a combined area of more than 300,000 sq miles (11,919 million sq km).\n\nOn average, just four people can be in one room at a time, with a floor space of just 32,500 sq ft (20,500 m\u00b2).\n\nIt is an enormous market with huge market opportunities in the areas surrounding both the new 'Centre', which has expanded rapidly, and the new 'Smithfield Market' with a potential for 100,000 new jobs.\n\nThe government hopes to launch the crown by 2015 and it is the second-largest trading centre in the country.\n\nA major investment, but still a challenge as it is more expensive (there are less than 10,000 sq ft at Smithfield Market today compared to 50,000 sq ft on a London suburb) and is a few hundred years old (it could be completed only within five years, given climate change which is likely to make it much longer).\n\nAs well as the large industrial area, the Crown has a number of other benefits.\n\nA city with the world's largest industrial property network (AAP) it is currently being developed by two companies with some of the world's largest investors, as well as the biggest international pharmaceutical group.\n\nThe investment comes as Premier Daniel Andrews prepares to enter another year of state aid funding for the city.\n\nWhile Premier Andrews did not announce his intentions to extend the state aid, it is hoped local businesses will benefit.\n\nThe state aid will include a $4bn (\u00a33.6bn) grant through the local government aid scheme which would give the new Crown more access to the capital, the biggest boost to investment since the 1960s.\n\nIt would also be able to increase employment, including those in the healthcare industry, which has long been a low-wage sector due especially to its ageing workforce in a country which can be seen as ageing fast.\n\nIt would also have helped create a good economic life here, making Australia the second-largest producer in OECD (OECD) terms.\n\nThe new Crown is expected to create a similar economic boost with two new industrial fields - one the manufacturing industry and another the agriculture sector - along with around 250 new jobs.\n\nA major commercial project this year in the south and east of Sydney, the Crown is expected to be completed in three years.","token_len":623,"entropy":[9.2172,3.8804,10.103,0.414,2.9262,4.6524,8.1417,4.4908,5.1154,17.0601,4.2956,0.1957,6.2253,12.0348,11.7184,2.4637,10.5883,5.8256,4.8719,4.529,1.8396,10.4775,9.551,6.9428,0.0925,4.9335,0.062,2.8033,6.5342,5.0526,2.854,5.1133,4.348,1.898,0.5573,2.5618,5.2029,2.7836,7.3553,1.4685,5.8277,0.311,2.5644,2.8675,0.8571,2.7559,1.2268,1.1535,0.0852,2.0355,3.7368,5.3995,4.7801,3.3474,2.5447,2.7099,2.9355,3.749,3.7507,1.0007,0.9658,1.5789,2.4529,2.0924,3.3038,5.4083,4.9456,8.0157,1.9738,0.6042,3.209,2.2587,4.1919,0.1763,0.5251,1.6707,5.8435,5.4343,4.1594,1.7569,0.1585,5.3777,2.4774,5.0304,0.1331,0.5828,0.4002,0.2582,1.6087,5.4457,1.2501,3.7618,5.9738,1.756,5.008,3.404,5.0421,4.7135,2.5508,1.3418,0.0003,4.4446,3.4245,4.1339,6.5172,0.9466,1.4751,0.125,0.4867,1.1035,2.8915,2.9682,2.7947,0.0568,2.9965,0.7769,1.6724,6.5411,1.9589,0.3758,0.415,1.5209,1.6131,0.9498,0.0003,3.0163,6.5593,2.4802,2.4745,0.0224,0.1955,2.2051,0.0083,4.6229,4.2155,4.8024,2.0267,2.2301,1.5512,3.1814,3.9229,0.1276,2.9882,0.0113,4.1693,0.8645,0.0047,1.6558,4.2358,0.9643,6.5081,0.4421,5.1438,4.1871,4.6095,0.5766,0.2033,0.7999,0.4082,0.0002,5.9674,3.3093,0.382,6.0407,5.0294,2.2438,4.1213,2.9168,2.085,3.0345,2.7539,1.7323,0.6745,0.1124,1.5741,2.1627,2.4637,5.49,1.9489,0.2445,2.6296,5.9507,2.1604,3.3888,0.146,1.1174,0.6825,3.8391,0.0429,2.8133,5.3624,1.5616,0.3937,0.2725,0.0002,2.6138,0.954,4.1532,3.9686,3.87,2.1347,4.3751,5.3638,3.9305,2.9308,1.7359,3.3938,3.2096,7.0602,1.6578,3.5911,2.5659,0.8966,0.0032,3.6826,2.3546,2.483,5.235,4.2067,2.0059,0.1568,0.467,2.0563,0.4944,8.7115,0.008,1.6999,1.2482,3.6598,1.9149,4.714,2.2042,4.3765,0.2677,0.0034,1.6929,1.2458,0.8441,0.1099,0.0002,1.5709,4.4684,3.4234,0.8808,5.4918,1.0028,5.8288,2.3281,3.5048,1.8146,3.4422,1.0187,4.8147,2.9288,3.3716,0.5642,4.7726,1.1723,0.4637,0.2334,3.2602,1.6465,0.3655,0.0002,3.9445,4.2943,4.0209,3.9183,3.9766,3.8713,1.9198,4.148,4.5444,1.5006,1.4808,5.354,1.4265,4.8516,6.2331,0.7046,5.1959,0.1964,2.6454,0.9159,0.029,2.3146,1.0497,3.9246,3.4326,0.0097,2.6393,3.154,1.8263,0.3168,5.1103,0.0305,0.0193,1.4426,0.0285,3.2161,3.8548,4.4186,6.55,1.6968,0.9282,3.1332,3.4199,6.0253,2.9162,2.3427,0.5216,2.1671,1.7247,4.8686,0.7118,6.2652,6.7917,5.034,2.6321,0.1434,3.1361,5.0809,7.6755,0.0938,4.9727,1.5902,3.5428,0.1103,3.2771,1.0153,3.0904,3.4352,0.6471,0.0905,0.0002,4.5415,1.8717,0.0853,1.4506,5.307,4.5193,2.7902,0.6056,0.9951,1.543,1.9346,1.822,2.5307,0.0023,1.8136,4.4424,1.9431,0.6238,0.0002,4.1536,5.3441,2.8663,3.3007,3.2229,0.0532,1.0702,4.7133,6.6567,5.1853,2.4621,5.9368,4.9657,2.8912,7.4754,1.2851,5.5241,5.1644,2.3327,1.7574,4.9891,2.5446,3.3469,5.2625,1.915,0.096,1.5228,0.0074,0.7059,6.9793,1.9228,4.0184,0.1057,0.0064,2.1005,3.1317,4.5952,6.6341,5.3789,1.9269,0.2496,0.0002,1.7162,6.3129,4.0065,1.9781,7.9853,3.7962,0.3953,3.3671,0.233,5.3445,7.981,3.8304,1.4767,5.937,3.9834,3.958,1.8633,0.6507,2.4434,1.1609,0.2868,0.0002,4.7668,5.6667,0.7145,4.2284,0.6601,2.8443,2.5869,2.5739,1.1964,5.1761,0.9314,2.9457,0.673,1.4963,2.6378,0.6914,3.1438,7.4388,3.2763,0.9136,2.3962,2.3199,0.1992,0.0002,1.6127,4.465,1.2881,1.9086,3.3356,2.2238,2.8734,3.6158,3.5146,3.0365,0.7178,0.3595,2.234,0.0466,0.0451,2.8159,6.0774,0.4715,5.2473,0.8651,7.4034,2.7202,2.7538,3.6742,3.2392,2.1778,4.1711,0.8602,2.9817,4.2994,0.0623,1.8228,2.5141,2.127,4.0368,4.9033,4.7306,0.9651,3.6211,2.6365,0.5499,4.7882,0.0123,0.5921,0.1296,0.0003,2.649,2.7226,0.3349,2.7657,4.2093,0.0146,3.7384,5.4328,2.2166,4.8206,3.8164,1.4049,1.2465,5.9024,3.0082,0.7547,2.1564,1.4594,4.5547,0.382,1.4985,6.348,0.5162,2.0157,1.1097,6.0316,9.0236,0.0199,4.2595,5.1225,1.259,5.6387,4.0262,2.7656,2.4803,5.2434,2.9314,2.3367,0.2543,5.3101,2.4407,0.2626,0.1133,0.0002,2.9907,1.5617,0.1534,3.394,5.0674,3.7071,1.5122,5.5232,4.2855,6.5901,6.4948,1.4218,5.1482,6.9113,1.507,2.1053,0.9855,0.4693,3.1152,2.4778,8.598,2.7459,5.0654,0.0003,0.4009,1.9485,1.0554,0.1673,0.0002,1.5151,2.3178,0.5514,1.2846,1.6058,0.0071,4.2755,2.3759,6.8151,2.14,2.2571,4.5172,5.7543,1.5252,4.1268,6.652,3.3772,2.6864,6.139,5.6454,2.4574,0.5462,1.9582,0.3376,3.9786,0.8328,1.5651,4.3476,0.0204,5.7734,4.6603,1.4593,0.8859,0.86,0.1856,0.0002,3.2919,3.674,4.995,3.957,6.203,0.4234,4.5682,1.1613,4.4491,5.3179,1.9923,0.4098,2.486,1.7606,1.5401,2.5083,1.2394,1.0718,0.0033,2.1783,2.9013,1.4789,4.6384,0.3042,1.1371]}

The family then attempted to sell the three estates to the Kingdom of Romania, but it failed, while a small group of brothers succeeded in selling the three lands in their names. However, when a new generation of brothers did the same thing, the village failed to sell the three lands to the Kingdom of Romania, and the two estates ended up in a permanent state of debt, despite the efforts of the sons of the three lords to sell them outright. After the death of his grandson Stephanie (13 November 1482 \u2013 16 March 1530), \u017bwi\u015bniowiecki passed to his grandson Stefanie, who became his mother and sister-in-law. The two sisters joined the Polish soldiers in Poland, and Stefanie joined the army. She adopted the same surname that Stephanie adopted as his mother. The sons of the three lords later married. The wife of his third father was a woman with long hair. She was a girl and she had short brown hair.

{"id":1996,"ended":true,"length":573,"text":"Varanasi experiences a humid subtropical climate ( K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cwa ) with large variations between summer and winter temperatures. The dry summer starts in April and lasts until June, followed by the frosty winter, when the soil is dried. The winters can be mild and dry, sometimes exceeding temperatures of up to 70\u00b0C. The dry warm summer season starts in October, during which only a few isolated showers are recorded (see Table 1 ).\n\nWith the onset of El Nino, the climate for rainfall and snowfall in Tamil Nadu in the recent months has become less favourable and has resulted in widespread and widespread rainfall and snowfall. This means that the monsoon will experience a more severe and prolonged spell (i.e. the entire duration of the average annual monsoon season in Tamil Nadu). With all those conditions combined, the drought is expected to be a long-term trend, which will be further aggravated by the severe drought in Kerala and also by the further deteriorating prospects for the water supplies and industries.\n\nDuring this period, the precipitation may have decreased from about 100 mm per annum in Tamil Nadu to 33 mm per annum in Kerala and 36 mm in Kerala. The rains, therefore, will be sustained throughout Kerala and Kerala\u2019s districts as well as parts of the north where dry spells are expected, particularly in the Tamil Nadu region.\n\nWith the onset of El Nino in Tamil Nadu in July, the rainfall will increase in Kerala from 8.5 mm per annum to 9 mm per annum.\n\nThe rainfall also will be affected by El Nino, which is likely to continue to intensify and could impact both the districts and the national capital. With the El Nino in Tamil Nadu beginning to intensify, rainfall will also increase in the north where the situation remains weak.\n\nThe most significant rainfall recorded in Kerala during the first half of the year was about 11 mm in the first half of last year. However, the annual rainfall is quite less and is only slightly lower than the average average of 12 mm in the last two decades.\n\nThe monsoon, in addition to its monsoon weather features, will also impact the water supply areas mainly in Tamil Nadu. During the rainy season during the last five years, Tamil Nadu was flooded with snow which would affect the water quality and would affect the quality of the water supply. Although Tamil Nadu has a low number of streams, there are various lakes in Tamil Nadu that could serve as reservoirs. In spite of this, the water level of rivers is much lower than those of the Tamil Nadu River which will also continue to flood during the second half of the year.\n\nThe intensity of dry weather is expected to continue which will also affect the groundwater quality and overall crop production in the district. In comparison with the initial drier-than-expected month of January-February, the wet season is expected to begin again in June. However, the monsoon may show a slower track this year in the districts and may even prove dangerous if it rains later in the year.","token_len":625,"entropy":[10.9362,0.0306,11.6534,1.6716,11.1187,10.3707,0.0037,0.0116,0.3965,4.3783,12.0489,6.464,3.5539,3.7818,10.457,7.463,6.8338,11.822,6.0054,2.2989,5.6142,4.6418,3.6496,4.9996,0.2339,0.1974,3.0715,1.0569,1.8735,5.8435,4.3475,6.7903,1.4887,3.8916,0.8003,2.5308,1.381,2.4446,1.7812,4.2867,0.0263,1.9508,7.4522,1.3949,0.8585,3.4535,2.146,1.0499,5.5762,1.949,5.3972,1.8781,1.4905,6.2329,4.3472,0.8167,3.7524,1.5726,2.1449,1.0462,5.774,4.1127,8.0117,0.5654,2.6291,0.0042,3.5872,0.8456,0.6047,1.0652,1.6451,3.5938,7.1532,2.3846,4.497,2.7039,0.413,2.8254,1.5621,4.0338,0.2455,5.8471,2.0526,0.919,4.5905,7.5873,1.921,2.4055,3.1796,3.1694,2.7469,0.7007,1.0913,1.7504,0.003,6.6756,1.4529,4.0154,0.0095,7.1887,1.3624,0.0004,1.0633,1.3057,3.7047,4.4274,5.5836,2.3359,2.0735,0.6513,2.0649,7.2313,0.0022,3.8459,1.8406,6.7476,2.5569,0.5952,2.7244,3.3596,3.1047,2.6182,4.1679,5.1867,0.0092,5.0423,3.5027,2.4892,3.5523,2.1556,0.1087,0.1142,1.2706,3.0541,4.4711,0.2228,1.3797,4.9036,0.1706,4.1712,6.7875,1.4944,3.3656,1.3136,1.7701,2.1952,5.9474,3.774,3.7274,0.004,0.0012,1.4178,2.8687,6.6436,4.8533,0.0666,0.5081,7.3701,4.6751,4.3335,0.0029,1.5981,3.0352,1.1323,0.0021,2.5896,4.8361,5.7516,5.5984,4.2569,5.4054,0.216,1.0217,4.32,3.004,1.0644,0.0201,2.794,3.398,3.661,0.6815,0.4406,4.7456,2.2597,2.922,0.9298,2.7818,4.8226,1.9191,0.4635,1.0278,3.888,1.5266,1.3031,4.628,1.7884,4.9357,1.0594,0.6706,6.2437,7.3071,6.0529,0.7637,1.5259,5.2261,2.2818,3.1132,8.4109,1.5581,0.574,0.0003,4.5777,3.0059,1.3923,0.4115,1.2198,4.8244,5.8362,3.2122,2.6146,3.7282,3.3692,4.1491,0.2731,2.6985,1.2993,0.0003,0.8831,4.3729,0.0037,0.6572,7.3528,0.0842,0.5052,0.0091,0.0012,0.1209,1.801,2.5429,5.3809,0.0307,4.4618,0.6277,1.0459,1.4166,5.518,3.4927,4.5944,0.0259,1.4431,1.5398,5.3342,4.2651,4.4336,1.2077,2.5732,14.6513,7.6349,6.5987,4.237,3.5245,1.4681,0.1739,4.7334,0.0056,1.434,3.6324,6.6006,4.8748,3.9848,1.4262,0.8692,3.2556,3.3983,0.577,0.8436,4.4726,0.046,2.1045,0.5389,1.1666,0.0002,4.9046,0.8076,1.4287,0.0021,0.5268,0.0596,0.0014,2.6202,2.3429,0.0006,1.6325,4.2539,1.0877,0.9675,2.4207,3.1549,2.701,2.6233,2.6324,2.3676,4.4584,1.9096,1.6847,0.111,0.2616,0.0114,0.0013,2.0652,3.0193,0.6222,0.0289,0.0026,0.0018,1.3172,3.5954,0.0003,1.6505,2.5336,5.3658,2.423,2.0204,3.9573,0.8022,4.5265,1.2172,0.0044,2.4373,1.0983,1.4615,4.0755,0.041,4.3984,2.0318,1.9884,2.518,6.1219,4.8912,4.4817,0.8542,6.966,0.8327,0.5592,3.6828,3.351,1.0731,4.466,0.9691,3.8027,0.0686,0.0025,3.3702,0.8467,0.0041,5.0228,1.8163,2.389,0.9239,3.2958,1.3368,2.729,0.9271,0.5143,1.6134,3.2139,4.7276,2.036,5.7386,4.4915,5.0492,0.8404,0.9891,0.0002,1.7116,5.3035,2.5405,1.7385,6.6104,0.7913,1.763,2.1904,0.6014,3.8666,0.9269,0.0093,1.1622,0.8992,1.407,3.9412,3.918,0.1376,3.2424,1.9754,2.8043,0.7954,0.0855,5.0333,0.158,0.9135,3.2687,0.0282,1.3698,5.7146,0.3414,3.4915,5.8911,6.361,3.4617,2.3504,2.9606,2.184,2.3844,1.1484,1.4601,2.0686,5.6545,2.2062,3.7375,0.0893,1.4794,0.3921,2.0698,2.2338,3.6959,0.5421,1.0462,0.0002,1.4619,3.9868,0.0386,4.1883,3.08,3.2834,0.0725,2.5493,5.5661,0.0686,5.6778,4.1936,0.3553,1.5446,0.793,3.1074,0.8133,3.322,1.0073,7.6569,6.1427,0.3539,2.7123,0.0016,1.1257,3.8629,0.4149,3.344,0.0649,4.0426,1.0135,2.9354,3.4875,0.4396,0.2738,4.1687,0.0017,3.6119,4.7807,1.3723,6.1248,4.6035,4.6671,3.6441,0.7094,0.7591,3.8084,1.7066,4.6043,2.7281,0.6548,3.0611,0.0264,0.7306,0.8261,0.6516,0.9941,5.2502,4.0364,0.0007,1.6937,1.9413,3.0861,4.3168,0.0023,5.7485,1.057,2.8023,0.4616,6.2703,4.3127,2.1286,2.6869,0.0079,2.0304,3.2741,5.0766,0.1026,0.7943,1.9086,2.9266,4.7603,0.0075,1.651,0.1716,0.928,1.7324,3.2886,2.0585,4.007,2.4078,3.0366,0.724,1.0447,3.499,0.7847,0.8244,4.5742,0.0374,4.0357,3.0264,4.4859,2.9049,6.4692,0.0353,3.9974,2.8847,0.2914,5.6008,0.0334,0.0126,0.2173,0.105,0.2205,0.5169,0.0002,1.4251,6.1545,0.1494,4.6573,3.4424,2.7697,1.9881,0.0288,1.7687,8.2798,0.6011,2.9469,1.0086,0.3985,4.1305,3.9048,1.5929,6.5776,5.549,1.7169,1.7673,0.7109,2.7233,0.3907,2.7495,6.0884,1.532,0.6317,6.7994,3.8755,0.5329,5.0139,0.1512,0.0126,4.2742,6.7706,1.0992,3.1859,2.8608,0.9869,0.7201,0.9177,2.8149,1.1061,2.072,0.7525,0.0103,3.2847,4.356,0.6776,3.7311,1.5061,3.4471,0.0201,1.154,3.5561,0.0059,4.1727,6.6795,0.8632,4.4704,5.6782,4.3815,0.9929,4.1066,1.2307,3.4339,2.5795,3.1131,3.2189,5.6664,5.9101,4.2981,1.5663,3.4392,5.1634,1.0764,0.1275,0.6554,0.2378]}

{"id":410,"ended":true,"length":570,"text":"After World War I, and with another European war looming, leaders from the historic peace churches met to strategize about how to cooperate with the government to avoid the difficulties of World War II.\n\n\"As long as I'm alive, I'll be here,\" said the Reverend David O'Sullivan, who is a Christian missionary who serves in the Western Sahara.\n\nO'Sullivan said the Rev. David O'Sullivan did the work.\n\n\"I came here for the purpose of helping people and trying to help people in need and make sure our missionaries have a place to live because we know they're not afraid of being attacked,\" he said.\n\nThe Rev. O'Sullivan said the Rev. David O'Sullivan had the greatest admiration and respect for the country as he served as missionary. He said the people of the people of the Western Sahara loved the Rev. O'Sullivan. \"He truly believed in the faith of our faith and in the faith of the people and that is very big in our world.\"\n\nIn the end, O'Sullivan acknowledged the power of prayer to help overcome the obstacles in peace resolution.\n\n\"In time, I have to say I regret that some people didn't see how the prayer was supposed to help me and that I regret that I didn't teach them that prayer in peace.\"\n\nIn his sermon on Jesus Day, O'Sullivan argued that prayer is the only option to bring peace to those fighting for independence. He said peace is a difficult task when soldiers are constantly being attacked, many of whom suffer from severe injuries.\n\nHe said prayer can be both effective in healing wounds and a spiritual blessing.\n\nO'Sullivan argued that the power of prayer has the potential to bring peace to the people of the Western Sahara.\n\nHe said prayer can also be useful in the midst of tension, and it can sometimes be used as the basis for military action.\n\n\"We're not going to go to war with another country for the sake of it,\" he said. \"We just want peace and stability in the world.\"\n\nO'Sullivan said the people of the Western Sahara believe it is time for the Rev. David O'Sullivan to leave his home in Bela Region.\n\nHe said he has been in Morocco since 1981 and returned as a missionary in 2009.\n\nHe said his mission has not required him to be in the region directly, but he plans to travel there in order to see the people and try to teach them how to use those resources in a way that can be seen to be beneficial.\n\nHe said the church has already been busy with a renewed mission. In the next few years, he expects to continue the mission of the missionaries, making more visits to the Holy Land.\n\n\"We're building a new building and the church is working on the structure as well,\" he said.\n\nO'Sullivan said he believes the church's dedication will be appreciated over the next five years.\n\nHe said the church continues to build the new building.","token_len":625,"entropy":[8.6336,0.0961,2.138,0.3971,5.5901,4.1589,7.2687,5.9334,2.398,3.0651,0.6642,8.2337,2.3257,1.8814,8.8366,7.4305,7.2354,5.7176,2.125,5.164,0.0092,2.1164,1.3087,0.387,7.6889,1.0077,1.2744,5.42,2.6979,3.9132,2.5603,7.5819,0.4342,4.4778,0.002,0.4881,0.2671,1.316,0.0008,2.9902,4.5285,3.576,0.021,3.3168,1.9915,3.432,0.4489,0.7157,1.8413,1.3835,3.6226,1.3287,1.7997,3.0563,4.2684,4.5545,4.5979,1.5591,4.2002,0.3906,1.4371,2.9216,2.943,5.1322,3.4836,2.1183,4.3235,1.4837,0.9119,5.9492,7.9179,1.3987,1.2676,0.0002,3.2492,0.0193,0.0027,2.0383,1.9232,5.5563,0.0262,3.2632,2.1526,0.005,0.0354,6.1426,4.4695,2.2171,2.8125,0.8793,0.0002,0.7597,1.85,4.3589,1.2367,2.9253,1.3227,2.6808,0.0947,2.0781,1.7607,2.8386,3.7579,0.0201,1.4223,2.0683,2.9726,1.4193,2.8983,4.9582,1.2113,4.7189,6.1596,3.0949,1.3223,2.021,0.9271,2.5121,5.2104,1.8871,2.9255,2.0518,1.3165,1.8214,6.7175,1.2727,3.4164,3.1265,0.9308,0.6203,0.0438,0.0656,0.4021,0.0001,1.8829,1.4672,0.0023,2.1187,0.001,0.0019,1.1467,1.9481,2.5388,0.0103,1.9581,0.1128,0.0023,0.0047,3.2721,3.349,4.765,6.8017,3.1293,1.4418,0.2011,1.096,5.2952,4.7551,2.211,2.4847,1.6134,5.1684,2.5604,2.6141,0.7713,1.8768,4.6636,0.872,1.2848,6.1286,0.498,1.0898,3.3757,0.0112,6.4644,2.5965,1.2738,0.0016,0.6582,0.001,0.0018,1.7546,4.7038,1.1257,6.2862,3.0802,0.8211,1.3849,4.2717,1.3422,3.2748,4.0369,1.5847,3.4335,0.7578,4.0271,0.1687,1.0099,1.1597,3.9067,3.175,2.6707,4.3567,6.1482,2.009,2.005,3.7779,2.4545,0.0617,0.0001,3.3695,2.0218,3.1993,0.0629,1.6697,0.0012,0.0019,6.8201,1.7393,4.8871,0.1682,3.8983,3.3017,1.5094,5.3595,1.5049,2.7051,2.6392,5.0762,8.9737,0.4834,0.4444,0.0001,0.2998,3.8184,6.0442,0.648,2.484,4.6584,3.2391,1.906,2.1951,6.8016,1.1349,4.5253,1.272,3.6597,0.0006,3.3995,3.3445,3.0947,3.7701,2.4328,5.5907,0.0015,1.4311,3.751,2.4398,2.1137,1.425,7.0396,0.8243,1.3349,1.4066,0.0005,5.9469,2.1218,2.4396,2.2347,2.9326,4.5259,3.2334,0.2661,0.0002,3.2922,2.8432,3.5957,3.0057,6.4612,4.798,0.489,1.0015,0.0012,0.0017,6.2602,0.4443,3.1742,1.7876,1.8963,2.4752,5.1464,1.6877,3.1109,0.7507,0.7561,3.2786,5.7574,1.0311,3.9676,1.1573,2.266,0.7389,3.5634,1.215,2.2453,6.1049,2.241,3.4769,6.7289,1.1002,4.6882,2.3036,2.9365,1.9959,6.3458,0.452,0.489,4.5673,0.7967,3.9138,2.4459,0.8611,0.3281,0.0001,2.7442,0.7639,2.8229,2.4674,1.9034,5.4499,2.5181,3.1656,4.3587,1.5787,0.2744,3.7814,4.5342,5.1859,1.1412,0.3833,0.0001,2.3941,0.0046,0.0018,5.5712,0.3834,1.9402,5.8553,0.109,0.1382,3.2542,3.844,0.6704,0.0247,1.9683,0.8325,0.4541,1.4001,1.3955,0.3005,0.3158,0.7227,0.0095,0.6448,0.4827,0.0001,2.3281,0.4366,2.6171,1.5389,2.3833,1.7426,4.6131,0.8667,2.5779,6.2346,0.0008,6.38,2.098,3.098,3.2668,0.6843,6.5508,1.3667,2.5585,1.5743,4.0092,2.5251,0.2421,5.3091,1.6668,0.5565,0.2168,0.0001,0.8224,2.5479,3.1375,2.0528,1.8956,0.0513,3.1558,1.5522,0.0509,2.4817,4.2623,0.3202,3.55,2.0611,0.5694,0.0023,4.196,1.402,0.7837,0.0363,0.0822,0.239,0.509,4.7041,0.6163,1.026,2.3404,3.2094,2.0096,0.7979,1.8898,0.9098,0.4031,0.0002,1.653,0.0052,0.0014,0.8382,1.7699,3.2955,0.0842,0.0768,0.557,0.0065,3.281,4.121,0.4285,2.643,0.9125,1.4255,4.5381,0.0007,0.6673,0.0159,0.0025,0.003,0.2032,2.5988,2.2512,4.1734,1.5865,5.1804,4.148,8.4255,1.6638,0.7069,0.0001,1.8935,0.3996,1.3375,2.7271,1.8307,2.6476,7.0474,2.3472,4.6111,0.903,5.254,4.9091,0.4289,0.5466,1.3341,3.7497,0.3368,0.8615,0.0002,2.0517,0.369,2.7738,2.0266,1.8973,3.5046,6.9941,0.727,0.0536,3.6321,2.0207,1.3261,3.0981,8.1829,1.1292,0.3082,1.1725,4.3847,0.0362,3.1659,2.5777,2.4015,2.7228,0.0175,4.5121,1.1701,1.7958,2.7522,4.6346,0.0575,4.4147,0.3044,2.1678,0.1034,4.0692,6.8429,1.6429,3.2784,2.7969,1.5758,0.2205,2.7415,1.9748,4.4432,2.9359,0.786,1.9033,1.3946,0.2154,0.0001,2.064,0.3393,1.9275,4.3847,1.7992,4.2974,2.3774,6.9216,2.0119,2.8292,6.4344,2.0958,2.6424,3.5423,1.8746,3.0626,0.6744,2.8002,0.2327,1.1731,2.5428,0.3536,3.6887,2.8658,1.3206,3.3798,1.792,6.0888,2.7528,5.8617,3.9587,1.82,0.912,0.5198,4.9694,0.2841,1.1956,0.3167,0.0002,1.6251,1.4073,1.4624,4.957,1.1644,1.6978,4.6126,2.0774,3.6244,2.4133,0.7557,3.6709,0.8202,2.2769,5.5328,3.8943,0.7147,0.8155,0.7029,0.0167,0.0575,0.738,0.0002,1.5933,0.0055,0.0013,0.4913,0.8995,3.4285,1.1257,1.9303,2.7844,6.4052,4.0579,1.7944,4.0169,6.3133,0.5488,0.7974,3.6299,0.2581,0.4218,0.5266,0.0001,1.6807,0.4442,1.209,1.0219,5.0866,0.0721,3.9362,2.5178,3.1995,1.0226,2.7364]}
{"id":2448,"ended":true,"length":608,"text":"According to historian Kate Bowler, the prosperity gospel was formed from the intersection of three different ideologies : Pentecostalism, New Thought, and `` an American gospel of pragmatism, individualism, and the idea of God.' She says that it was not until a few decades later that the gospel was realized, and it will always be a Christian gospel.'\nSome scholars say, the prosperity gospel can be characterized by an open-minded approach to life and the pursuit of freedom, liberty and justice. But others dismiss the prosperity gospel as merely an ideology, arguing that this is a very specific notion and has no bearing on the actual beliefs and practices of believers.\n''If we only put the prosperity gospel into perspective, if you had all of these groups that have had the opposite of freedom and justice in mind as gospel leaders as to why people are so willing to live as if they are good people then we can say that the whole message of the prosperity gospel is that people are happy to be free from the oppressive, and that is very different from what is actually happening in our own lives,' Bowler said. She says that the belief that all humans are equal has led to discrimination, prejudice and hatred.\n''When some groups, for example, would say that if the human being is better than me and that I am better than them, then that's actually what we're doing. People who have been poor because they have been poor because they have been poor actually believe that you can bring those out of poverty when you bring them into your hands and allow them to use those resources for things of the mind,' she says.\nIt was the growth and radicalization of the prosperity gospel into a popular ideology by the turn of the century that would later be called '' the Great Recession,'' Bowler says. Her book, ''God's Hope,'' also describes how the growth of many denominations during the Great Recession led to the rise of a popular church system which saw the growth of many other Christian denominations.\nThe prosperity gospel was born from the belief that the best way to live a life is to be good.\n\"We know in America, there is an abundance of opportunity for people to become in the next generation,\" Bowler says.\n''We have a lot of things to overcome, and it takes some time for us to overcome it.''\nFor example, Bowler says the biggest mistake an educated person can make is thinking that everyone is a god at this level, and that that is going to be OK, she adds. ''We have problems of believing in god and not believing in everything else,'' she says.\nIn order to get to Jesus, however, one need to believe in God and work against all the negative and negative stereotypes that have been thrown around about being religious. While believers often believe they can live a fulfilled life by trying to \"make God better\" and going against the false teachings of the Church as an individual, critics have found the truth and reasonableness of the gospel to be deeply ingrained in people's minds, and are often mistaken for religious believers.","token_len":625,"entropy":[1.9909,9.1425,7.7163,7.736,3.0975,0.2857,1.6363,10.7495,6.6239,1.8413,6.6057,3.8508,1.2156,9.8559,0.0895,4.9046,3.199,4.9655,8.3674,10.5278,0.0445,0.0001,0.2315,0.3582,0.5894,6.3531,6.9896,0.6088,0.0416,13.6623,10.9576,4.7251,7.1687,1.1483,9.287,0.004,0.0194,2.4332,4.7153,0.1527,0.2681,0.7252,3.448,5.1157,0.4808,2.5675,6.0713,4.9104,3.0455,1.0973,3.8577,0.886,2.9391,3.1191,4.2387,2.0485,1.5607,0.5995,0.451,1.0268,3.4875,2.018,5.0106,2.7579,1.0362,2.3,6.2142,2.839,0.2195,2.6165,5.2413,4.4395,4.4126,1.7309,10.9759,3.7698,2.6513,4.6192,4.5687,6.7925,0.0337,5.0166,0.6404,4.7418,1.2557,3.3347,5.0382,1.3534,0.5463,2.2939,0.3608,2.5178,2.005,2.1766,2.4453,0.019,5.5039,1.6037,4.651,1.6943,1.8256,0.6274,2.8221,1.9409,5.5063,0.9987,2.6082,0.0216,0.3658,4.4486,1.8436,2.9356,2.017,4.6887,0.172,4.8509,2.0178,1.8768,4.9937,4.165,5.8144,2.7327,4.3236,1.3345,2.4205,0.1084,0.8109,4.2893,4.3609,1.8085,1.0777,0.1004,5.1124,0.5921,0.8501,4.0532,3.8974,2.4552,5.9903,5.4107,1.9895,2.0563,0.0226,2.1892,3.0877,0.4644,4.7813,3.635,5.5599,4.3242,2.3409,1.7095,5.0631,2.3663,3.1303,3.9144,2.4861,6.3884,2.1727,3.8771,0.9912,3.0607,2.2969,5.4337,4.5931,6.8491,2.0854,6.3566,5.9778,3.6539,4.5864,1.8465,2.7142,3.6887,0.073,4.1502,3.5373,2.4947,0.664,1.1839,6.0297,1.5899,4.5026,2.713,3.1667,2.007,0.879,1.5634,5.5312,4.4542,0.7171,0.3767,1.1408,0.0081,0.4274,1.4314,2.534,0.9843,3.8531,2.4481,1.9668,1.3081,3.0961,1.8435,4.9558,3.1369,5.1627,2.2192,3.2986,4.2961,3.0091,0.3299,1.4612,2.9148,3.9786,1.9016,0.6307,3.1517,2.746,3.7934,2.3558,2.3032,0.003,1.3099,0.197,4.6047,2.8088,0.9775,1.4743,5.0258,0.67,3.898,4.3744,0.4957,2.8339,3.7297,3.8973,1.147,6.5525,1.7502,5.2576,1.1609,5.2188,1.4985,0.6497,2.5027,4.0929,5.3415,3.7112,3.3286,3.6076,0.2255,0.2848,5.0984,1.3808,1.1228,3.3253,3.8481,6.6961,2.2876,1.1203,4.1247,2.2626,6.7591,2.3691,2.3885,0.8288,1.1985,1.5979,0.2108,1.305,0.7942,0.8628,1.9744,1.7789,5.6996,2.6072,2.5332,1.4336,1.6175,1.4824,4.439,2.813,2.845,2.0249,6.1468,4.8401,1.2641,1.6696,0.8536,1.2401,3.1554,0.5505,0.578,0.4535,0.6131,6.2137,3.0387,0.4411,4.6256,1.9842,6.0193,3.8227,5.241,0.8061,0.0971,4.5025,0.3863,3.7728,0.8989,2.1418,3.761,8.2937,2.0587,5.4907,0.0992,0.134,5.0048,1.5797,1.2434,2.4381,4.058,5.2026,4.0833,5.2319,2.3992,1.6885,3.4113,0.0563,0.7711,4.5969,2.5746,2.1497,4.6783,2.9108,7.2396,0.2564,0.1005,0.9948,1.5957,0.0177,8.2319,1.3831,4.7772,3.4176,5.649,1.2331,6.0273,0.0023,0.0039,1.5828,0.1519,5.5554,4.2914,3.3172,2.2465,3.582,3.2816,4.9106,3.3513,2.6064,1.616,0.0027,0.4749,0.1306,4.6559,1.593,1.8032,1.0825,5.8579,1.0709,4.8721,3.0619,4.7329,3.1843,1.8914,0.8983,3.7547,0.4803,6.7359,5.9181,5.2518,0.2499,0.9599,0.0698,2.9654,0.2079,1.5057,2.5079,0.0665,2.0877,5.4467,5.6485,6.386,3.9604,4.8068,2.0048,3.2277,0.1948,2.2045,2.5931,3.6236,0.5249,1.8843,0.5309,2.5605,2.0124,0.0173,1.6632,4.0073,2.7697,0.9193,2.6565,0.16,2.112,3.9963,0.7089,0.1075,2.0244,2.4137,2.3399,2.9168,0.5434,1.6745,3.2772,1.4799,1.7173,3.715,2.9947,3.7717,4.0459,4.2325,2.7784,3.7979,1.2517,2.6214,2.9036,0.0473,3.6107,1.4734,1.859,0.7178,4.259,6.3182,1.9543,5.9924,1.1382,3.4645,0.2552,0.0023,0.5341,0.1321,2.5903,2.8594,2.1964,2.4141,1.5828,2.5336,0.0597,4.7639,2.7079,5.5322,1.6461,1.3116,2.9507,3.9647,3.3424,1.3789,2.1873,2.0192,0.0929,3.4973,3.0098,3.3679,0.5106,4.0477,2.318,0.0248,1.2601,0.0017,0.4919,2.6401,5.9442,4.5598,5.7527,4.4586,0.808,0.6566,0.0279,0.6157,3.8954,0.7201,3.9888,1.0514,3.4407,4.2658,6.3874,3.5166,4.4231,1.8002,1.549,0.8058,4.2006,1.2776,5.2778,0.0356,1.884,5.3557,2.6851,3.5789,2.8282,0.0579,2.75,2.4582,1.6254,5.1926,2.8456,7.0638,1.5881,4.1188,2.0494,2.1647,1.406,0.076,5.8604,2.5419,2.1531,0.2496,0.2442,0.0922,0.832,3.3793,4.531,0.2231,3.2355,1.7416,6.3735,0.6469,4.663,0.0051,2.4655,4.4889,1.815,2.7032,0.7436,0.9044,1.9317,5.563,6.3922,2.3997,1.8424,3.3392,3.3936,2.072,5.1738,1.0339,2.2199,0.7119,3.3957,1.2456,1.4482,6.7242,4.6912,0.4695,5.636,6.6211,2.9888,2.3591,3.4483,2.448,3.442,1.6506,6.5115,0.1357,2.6883,5.3643,0.2751,5.2611,3.1139,2.5482,4.1117,1.8596,1.9221,6.3924,3.6965,1.2658,5.5346,2.1801,0.2207,1.2334,3.9039,5.8542,3.8885,2.4599,0.3989,6.1123,2.6434,3.4791,2.3971,4.339,3.1296,6.6658,3.0081,0.0002,0.1665,0.6147,1.2825,0.9348,0.127,4.5316,4.7501,0.2431,2.9258,0.2785,1.6148,2.2747,2.3099,3.8426,1.8079,4.2665,0.3563,3.5502,3.9284,0.5536]}
{"id":1591,"ended":true,"length":523,"text":"On September 12, satellite images indicated that the eighteenth tropical depression of the season formed southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Located in close proximity to Tropical Storm Norbert, the depression would soon become one of the largest, highest-end tropical storms in the history of Southern hurricane history, and it was centered about 4,300 nautical miles off of Cape Horn, Texas.\n\nA high-pressure system formed over northern Florida Sunday night (October 4), resulting primarily in gusty winds. According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the disturbance would make landfall near the coast of South Florida on September 13.\n\nNorbert is one of four tropical cyclones heading to the Gulf Stream area of the tropics on Sunday afternoon (October 4). It has a maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour. This will have an estimated surface water temperature of 50 degrees C (100\u00b0F). Most tropical systems forecast to approach Florida on Sunday have a maximum area of 5\u201310 degree C (104 degrees F).\n\nDuring this storm season, there may be a 3.8-inch (20\u201320m) rainfall event with a potential for heavy rainfall, or possibly more. The storm, which moves to the north-northwest on Thursday night, is expected to produce 5-10 millimetres of rainfall, with up to an inch (30\u201340 cm) of rain falling.\n\nAt this point in the season, the tropical storm will bring a very active high of 83 cm (160 cm) (100 cm) (100 cm) (100 cm) (0% maximum). High winds will become strong and strong at times, with gusts up to 40 mph (66 kph). The maximum sustained power is 65 mph (105 kph). A fast-moving tropical storm (Tropical Storm Norbert) is forecast to reach the U.S. on Sunday morning (October 5).\n\nThe tropical depression would bring a strong, large storm surge. This could result in an increase in sea level, which could result in severe flooding.\n\nTo protect the region from any potential tropical storm, the University of Florida\u2019s Storm School of Tropical Storm Center has released three additional tropical disturbance warnings. These are:\n\nFinnish storm, Hittatas\n\nSwedish storm, Seishinna\n\nGerman storm, Schlossberg\n\nHungarian storm, Stravno\n\nNorwegian storm, Oryka\n\nSweden storm, Trelkek\n\nThe Finnish storm, Hittatas, will also continue strong winds and storm surge.

{"id":3717,"ended":true,"length":560,"text":"Despite the song having been a hit \u2013 and its status as the first @ - @ ever pop charity single, fourteen years before Band Aid and USA for Africa \u2013 `` Bangla Desh' - which became the band's first US tour, has a much stronger future ahead, thanks to a huge rise in audience and sales. Today (3 January) will be the 21st anniversary of Bangla Desh, a song which was written and recorded at the UK home of The Beatles. The concert will be streamed online via bandaid-bandaids and is available for streaming on Bandaid, iTunes, and Google play.\n\nOn the occasion of Bangla Desh - the only 'official' UK music festival - The Beatles recorded a new song, titled 'Break Up', in tribute to them last October. The single, 'Break Up', has become a sensation at home and abroad. The song was a \"steal\", \"paint-in-your-noses\" song by The Beatles and was sung by The Beatles' former singer John Lennon. The Beatles later said that it was \"outrageous\" that the song ended up on the British television programme The West End - and that it had to be sung in Bangla. The song, which was recorded at home, was released on 7 January, 1984, while Bangla Desh was playing in Bangla 2, an online streaming music event supported by The Beatles' association with JBL Music Group. It has a score of 40:12 of the Beatles recording of last September, when Lennon wrote of the band in his letter announcing Bangla Desh. According to the Beatles, Bangla Desh became popular by its 'newness' and in early 1982, it recorded the song \"Break\" in Bangla 2.1 on their first US tour. It also featured in many pop music songs to this day. In early 1982, Bangla Desh was also played at the UK Tour, but the band was banned from touring due to its popularity and it was cancelled by The Beatles in 1986.\n\nIn addition to 'Break Up', Bangla Desh featured in The Rolling Stones' song 'The Man Who Loved Love'.\n\nA new video for the 'Break' hit was released yesterday, titled 'Break Up'. There was an opening line and the song begins \"In your face\".\n\nAt least 1,600 people turned up at the event, and a record of the song has been made available to the public.\n\nToday, Bangla Desh will hold in a festival for the first time since the band split in 2004. The venue, which is one of eight concerts held worldwide each year, is located in Manchester.

The rebels were released on 19 November and a truce was reached on 29 November.\n\nReferences","token_len":627,"entropy":[10.4699,0.8954,6.2886,2.4777,1.09,2.0648,5.8965,3.3578,0.9769,6.0309,8.5306,5.0294,3.1188,4.3533,2.5645,5.2838,2.7013,0.1607,11.2756,1.8713,7.3453,9.5154,6.1832,6.5022,5.5391,5.0361,0.7274,9.0962,8.8333,1.3571,7.7686,5.0072,0.5306,11.9926,0.1247,4.9676,1.8655,9.1018,0.2394,4.7258,1.6763,3.5425,4.067,4.0045,0.0333,0.0125,0.0011,2.6017,3.0753,5.8382,0.0809,0.5082,3.1849,1.2755,1.906,1.2718,2.8947,2.4049,2.3884,2.9868,3.524,0.0192,3.0541,1.2685,1.3597,3.9069,3.0923,2.0217,4.3411,4.3866,0.0053,3.0069,0.8799,1.5872,1.0923,1.2818,0.0016,4.8649,0.6208,3.1627,3.1343,0.0725,1.675,2.3822,5.9483,2.7519,6.1254,1.8846,0.7474,3.2137,0.0037,0.0007,0.0069,4.3912,4.1635,4.1461,0.1837,0.2901,3.2201,2.071,3.4478,0.6812,0.5413,0.5805,4.5174,0.7622,1.1636,0.8916,5.6581,0.1397,0.9533,3.2253,0.0006,7.0473,4.8301,0.5514,2.1926,4.2895,2.9396,1.3355,2.9382,4.436,6.1698,0.0221,3.8857,2.3009,0.252,0.9541,1.663,1.2078,4.1092,2.7918,0.6218,3.0089,0.7084,1.2587,0.0002,2.1531,3.1063,0.7684,0.1738,1.0274,0.7839,4.5782,4.6915,1.7399,3.6781,1.7631,4.6115,5.6493,1.5546,4.0051,1.5059,5.7931,4.1751,0.3345,1.4448,3.807,3.0998,0.0792,2.1449,3.3374,4.6435,6.3857,5.1817,6.3142,0.9617,2.2862,0.6713,4.2693,2.0168,1.8692,4.5418,2.0097,2.1714,3.9558,1.6771,0.5835,0.0002,0.8613,1.6812,2.6187,0.0827,0.8508,0.5926,3.0601,2.3464,7.2543,0.0647,4.6932,1.1459,2.1748,1.8534,4.1873,2.4068,0.4524,2.7866,0.955,0.6192,1.1832,1.8353,0.0123,4.813,0.7194,1.9065,0.0002,0.4636,4.3929,3.9333,0.0887,0.6777,0.3125,5.0336,3.3371,0.9095,0.0405,0.792,6.8643,1.1753,0.2245,3.9807,0.0977,0.0063,0.039,2.7959,1.1205,4.0516,0.0515,1.0829,1.9714,3.4634,3.7041,0.9509,1.9856,0.2564,2.4799,0.2671,0.0069,0.0019,3.2007,0.4543,6.0123,0.721,0.0123,0.1603,7.7794,4.9255,2.6857,0.6382,2.9893,1.7933,0.0245,0.098,6.5875,1.5158,1.0209,0.0466,0.0637,4.8224,5.4857,1.7851,7.054,6.5633,4.1386,2.5379,1.3642,1.9931,3.5925,3.7888,1.2411,0.7935,0.0002,0.5152,2.1882,2.8429,0.0622,0.5846,0.2804,2.2937,1.6651,2.5197,0.0484,3.9226,0.5294,0.274,7.8591,3.3628,1.6076,3.2288,0.6351,0.265,0.7337,1.0528,0.0002,5.0506,3.1026,0.1188,4.811,0.3968,0.0505,0.5913,0.3114,4.207,2.8219,1.2593,0.5315,4.4876,2.5369,1.7744,1.1123,0.1235,0.0029,0.0005,1.948,0.1761,1.2683,0.0244,5.9872,0.603,3.0351,3.2505,1.6558,2.2028,0.0026,0.5549,6.3673,0.0115,4.1372,1.286,1.5689,2.6027,3.0066,0.0808,0.0716,0.7508,0.2439,1.9565,1.0666,0.6648,0.1848,0.862,0.2292,0.0045,0.0013,1.1655,0.2105,4.7484,4.0848,5.445,5.3605,3.252,1.164,1.3575,1.0796,3.1698,0.7709,0.5769,0.2143,2.4301,0.371,2.3442,0.8784,2.9877,2.7336,0.0039,3.3551,1.947,5.453,1.3919,1.2506,3.2257,6.9228,0.2077,5.3279,4.4388,7.6426,0.0025,0.4708,7.3613,2.0227,0.5555,4.2767,0.324,1.0373,0.5352,4.3705,1.4786,5.4422,2.3709,2.4212,3.2345,1.5333,0.5885,0.0001,0.4468,2.7275,0.087,0.0616,0.4578,0.1481,3.1677,0.8705,0.3011,0.173,0.8571,4.5506,1.5533,0.4612,0.0683,0.004,0.0007,2.2204,0.6198,0.2544,0.1342,0.0218,0.0037,0.0144,0.3535,14.8092,0.0524,0.1639,0.0403,0.1143,0.5022,2.7677,0.0371,0.0194,0.2171,0.0281,6.8647,1.2541,2.2573,0.4601,0.8728,7.7634,2.7423,1.0436,0.0631,4.9554,3.2503,1.3806,2.6383,1.9705,1.8538,0.3304,0.647,0.0001,0.4332,3.5893,0.1628,0.0394,0.2964,0.1086,1.4151,0.9744,0.2508,0.0255,2.8968,0.3145,0.154,0.4325,0.3139,0.0087,5.1788,1.8093,0.2498,2.687,5.3716,5.3327,0.0741,3.1667,1.0258,2.2117,0.1311,1.3474,3.1121,0.5085,3.9452,0.8696,0.3391,1.7472,0.325,4.5637,1.5433,0.0519,0.4036,1.7098,0.1481,6.1152,5.3518,2.4405,3.1445,3.3021,2.4452,0.8479,0.0002,0.3898,2.5267,3.5355,0.0369,4.7605,1.6816,1.2032,3.5154,5.268,0.5332,4.4965,4.0253,0.8419,3.2494,8.8365,0.088,1.3668,6.379,0.4241,2.5071,4.1455,6.5704,0.3783,8.0084,4.278,5.6165,5.0184,3.9422,2.302,2.0108,1.5647,5.5542,0.3664,4.1682,4.5026,3.3871,4.3102,1.7169,4.08,3.9406,4.064,0.225,2.0476,2.4929,0.1499,5.3385,5.5128,2.738,0.5941,7.1369,2.5763,1.0515,0.2603,1.4022,1.9579,0.1327,0.0021,2.2948,0.8534,3.8492,3.2226,4.9605,1.8957,2.2887,2.2366,3.1199,0.2084,1.37,2.4771,2.4247,5.0337,1.1451,2.5523,1.1656,2.9933,5.1444,0.5401,3.2247,4.1772,1.0302,4.0198,1.3116,3.6257,1.8518,5.517,1.8758,1.4216,3.8606,0.0292,0.0023,3.4777,1.1993,4.9211,5.6647,3.1148,1.6726,3.9376,7.1499,2.7478,3.1724,1.9896,1.1165,4.208,1.2736,0.0225,0.0916,0.3501,7.4107,4.7362,0.9216,2.6748,0.8697,2.028,7.1248,1.3824,3.298,0.105,2.4097,5.1175,5.7571,0.3022,1.9349,2.4382,4.9759,0.2627,0.3029,0.2461,0.0002,7.7885]}
{"id":4453,"ended":false,"length":575,"text":"Director Hideo Kojima confirmed in 2006 that a film adaptation of Metal Gear Solid was in development. He also hinted that the movie may be set in Alaska, the original setting for the game. [Kojima\/Source]\n\nBruh I just got the green light to write this, I didn\u2019t have an idea on time\u2026 (I\u2019m not too good at remembering times.) Anyway, I did my due diligence on the film and came up with a script for Metal Gear Solid. I was looking at everything and I was very happy with my choice, but because of all of this, I had to wait until 2009 to do it. I also got so much support from the public, but the support was very slow until about a year ago\u2026 And as much as I loved this film, it was one of the few times I played a game again. The problem with a movie adaptation of a game is that there\u2019s no end in sight to the game that is in development or has finally become part of the community. There are too many other aspects of the game to just make it a long movie. As for what should happen after Metal Gear Solid, don\u2019t give me any ideas on how the story goes, but there is a lot I\u2019m working on, but I\u2019m really not interested in making it an all-time classic. If it\u2019s not the story, you can leave me out of this one, right? That was my reason. I just want Metal Gear Solid back. I want to give this game a happy ending. [Kojima\/Source]\n\nI don\u2019t give a [title] in the comments, so I haven\u2019t given any specific answers.\n\n[A]\n\nI\u2019ve made many friends with some of these characters. But I want to tell what I got out of them. I like each character and the story. I like all of the characters, but I also like all of the characters\u2019 personalities.\n\n[B]\n\nBut what I got out of them was that no matter who it is which characters are on this game, no matter who it is which they\u2019re related to, they can still be in it. It\u2019s not possible for us to just do it without having characters. I got a lot of inspiration at this level, and a lot of people said they got it for free [instead of on release]. But I didn\u2019t get in a fight with them, I got in some problems.\n\n[C]\n\nSo I can\u2019t give full answers, but they definitely have that character in the story. I think the story was told very well. When he came back three years later, you see that there were some scenes in the game that was really very important. So I don\u2019t know what it would have been without the character he\u2019s had since his first battle with Boss X.

{"id":4553,"ended":true,"length":546,"text":"The use of the national flag grew as Japan sought to develop an empire, and the Hinomaru was present at celebrations after victories in the First Sino @ - @ Japanese and Russo @ - - Japanese, the official Japanese flag of Japan, in a ceremony marking the centennial of the Second Intention, November 19, 1941.\nIt also marked the anniversary of the arrival of an army of U.S. Forces II in Okinawa (USF IV) \u2013 USF III, the American invasion mission to Japan from Okinawa, April 8, 1945 \u2013 February 6, 1946.\nToday, Japan is named as the \"World Flag of Japan\" because the nation has two symbols. One symbol represents the flag (U.S. national flag), while the other symbol represents the banner (Japanese national flag).\nThe Japanese flag is a powerful symbol in the country and its history \u2014 and its symbolism with regard to a \"world flag\", \"world flag of Japan\", is in many respects the same as U.S. national emblem, both of which are symbolic, but more closely associated. The U.S. national flag was also the first flag flag to form a complete official state flag of the nation.\nThis flag symbolizes the official status of the U.S. government. It is one of the U.S. flags that is recognized as part of Japan's national flag.\nIn the U.S., the flag carries the Japanese national symbol, which is the symbol of a country with long history of cooperation with the United States. The flag is also used by the U.S. military during World War II.\nSince both the U.S. and Japan have the same government rules, the flag in Okinawa has always been the flag of Japan and the U.S.\nThe flag in Okinawa had also been adopted in the U.S. when Japan was founded. In early 1945, the island came under the rule of the U.S. and the U.S. troops had left Okinawa for the United States.\nOkinaku is the first state in which the U.S. is a major power and even the largest island of Japan. The U.S. is considered the greatest ally in the world.\nOn November 19, 1941, the new flag of the U.S. was given to the government of the northern island Okinawa.\nThe U.S. flag is a symbol at the start of a relationship between the United States and Japan, which has developed over time and since the establishment of the federation, especially since in 1974 it became a sign of the strong relationship between the countries. The U.S. military had been stationed here since 1941 and the peace treaty between the U.S. and Japan gave the U.S. an advantage over the other sides of Okinawa.\nThe U.S.-Japan agreement was a precursor to the Treaty of 1945-1945, which gave the countries and territories of Okinawa an agreement on maritime borders and borders and ended the occupation of the land.\nBoth of the territorial waters of Okinawa belong to Japan.","token_len":627,"entropy":[6.8968,0.0402,2.8499,8.065,3.4843,9.4364,3.0427,7.7862,5.0242,0.2608,4.4272,2.7821,4.6719,2.4493,1.886,1.9987,11.0581,1.9229,0.6872,3.5752,8.6926,1.9166,6.7759,6.2089,7.1086,1.1691,0.8514,4.072,6.7367,0.9025,17.8076,8.1228,6.9824,5.1241,5.0456,6.0232,6.1442,0.9322,2.5377,3.1865,3.2967,4.1057,5.4601,1.1284,1.4485,2.1228,1.0468,1.9548,3.4908,4.4861,1.8108,3.0926,0.4429,3.6499,1.1418,0.1041,0.4417,4.69,7.9654,4.3282,3.5135,5.2377,3.6106,0.2466,3.0995,0.5554,2.0382,7.8097,3.7744,3.5922,0.3147,2.9431,0.0325,0.3358,5.347,0.0445,5.4851,2.6879,0.6501,6.3619,0.1865,0.0338,0.0628,5.3892,7.5999,1.7349,3.3225,3.7249,5.022,2.5395,7.8502,1.0583,6.615,4.6387,0.7716,2.385,1.9476,2.374,4.9919,4.0791,8.5607,1.5351,1.6616,3.3649,2.3241,1.4697,4.7843,3.4048,0.2085,1.0262,1.8074,6.4294,2.9446,0.0257,0.5631,0.6906,0.6904,5.9162,0.5397,3.196,2.1889,6.232,2.871,1.084,2.8793,4.1539,6.7982,0.5622,0.7696,0.8471,4.9223,2.211,3.6422,2.6369,4.1536,5.3242,3.021,3.4199,2.9617,3.0911,0.8948,4.3696,4.5452,4.6539,0.9337,0.0322,0.3668,5.8441,0.7796,1.5581,2.2262,0.0855,0.0411,0.8548,1.0651,0.4749,7.0066,1.1868,1.7668,0.4081,0.1298,0.5284,0.8722,1.3006,2.6938,1.273,1.3858,2.2789,6.0083,0.2811,3.2141,1.2562,3.779,2.3137,4.0489,2.8604,7.4522,2.8584,3.2446,3.7633,6.5223,3.1004,0.0021,4.8454,5.2746,2.9905,1.7981,3.1738,3.9191,1.793,3.0451,1.9711,0.5613,0.569,1.5486,4.4293,2.5128,1.6751,2.2356,0.4953,0.5929,6.3226,0.0017,0.0061,0.0298,0.7675,6.1099,2.2556,4.6073,2.0773,0.2653,1.2297,5.1182,3.7296,1.844,4.9082,3.3429,3.4542,1.4122,2.0145,2.4635,0.001,0.0014,0.012,1.4028,0.2078,2.6234,4.0985,2.4316,2.7281,2.2125,8.069,1.5472,6.716,1.5065,5.8925,5.7278,2.9576,1.7673,3.0226,1.0316,2.2393,1.0046,0.7736,4.2009,1.9153,3.9575,0.1735,0.8175,6.6177,2.4274,0.378,0.5722,3.243,0.0008,0.0009,0.1029,2.3698,2.3321,1.2842,1.1241,3.9599,0.1732,0.4709,5.8008,0.0007,0.0007,0.0624,2.8956,1.5495,1.8348,4.191,1.4526,4.3461,0.0037,3.0525,0.3644,1.336,1.2899,1.0981,1.2744,2.7725,1.8635,2.7228,0.0005,0.001,1.06,0.6239,2.3164,5.9851,1.2863,2.6716,1.5821,2.7773,1.3027,2.7071,0.9746,1.5978,4.5278,0.1753,3.4943,3.4251,3.4888,6.8074,1.0833,1.0529,4.0978,1.4594,0.5952,0.8075,0.0123,0.5528,1.3445,2.4559,1.459,2.049,2.6055,1.7137,1.1297,1.4052,0.0008,0.0024,0.0317,1.2626,3.9189,2.4756,0.0035,0.0711,1.6059,0.7338,4.6182,6.739,1.0371,0.9979,0.0004,0.0006,0.0205,0.4354,1.1489,1.379,3.1279,0.6209,5.4053,8.908,0.8637,1.3511,2.1992,5.2131,5.8735,2.8455,4.2048,0.63,2.3213,3.3375,0.1975,2.1508,2.598,1.5864,2.2104,0.0005,0.0013,0.0513,4.7172,1.4019,2.5925,2.9893,0.8544,6.1087,5.2875,0.7367,2.817,2.0335,1.5301,1.8253,0.0006,0.0047,0.1785,4.4408,2.0813,2.2045,3.3269,1.7695,2.3963,5.6098,1.8799,0.2625,0.8177,6.2912,6.5329,0.5843,1.4528,2.7946,0.0162,0.5514,1.6098,0.0008,0.005,0.1879,2.6664,1.5408,1.3198,0.0007,0.0119,0.0341,6.2724,3.6684,5.3969,2.1667,2.9339,1.3822,3.1092,0.0683,0.547,1.2224,5.3171,0.0161,12.0146,2.2808,1.941,3.2527,3.221,1.0352,4.2903,0.7326,1.1583,0.0004,0.0011,0.0302,2.9591,2.003,2.8561,1.7289,1.9681,6.1658,1.9873,3.1801,3.9727,3.2569,1.204,0.6205,1.7173,1.6458,0.0006,0.0017,0.0325,2.1678,4.1005,1.4257,4.0547,3.591,1.3004,0.4096,0.7758,1.7689,1.0442,4.0065,2.5033,1.4696,0.2336,0.8508,0.1756,0.8497,6.1279,4.4623,1.634,1.2263,1.2462,0.0006,0.0012,0.0438,0.8332,4.8044,1.0632,0.6359,5.7582,0.5118,1.5793,6.0673,1.6484,6.3927,0.9886,1.2693,1.3139,1.988,0.0009,0.0022,0.0159,2.0136,1.9222,2.4292,1.5679,8.0607,0.801,4.4623,0.0891,2.3869,8.0786,0.9399,0.5404,2.0245,0.006,0.0794,0.7313,1.7953,2.2215,2.3384,4.1318,1.9827,2.5427,2.597,4.5249,1.1684,4.8141,0.0146,0.507,7.034,3.1764,4.6764,1.5817,6.4355,6.408,4.0983,1.7599,1.7277,3.7453,0.3061,2.5573,5.8005,2.3092,0.4514,0.3965,4.3438,0.4837,2.2693,0.9652,0.0006,0.0014,0.0022,3.7931,3.9683,2.4342,2.5303,4.6795,1.2153,3.5592,1.3152,2.2772,6.6243,1.0573,1.5794,0.5359,2.3042,0.0007,0.0022,0.0648,0.0408,0.2465,5.4802,1.0611,1.7577,0.0006,0.0026,0.021,3.7144,3.7122,1.3664,0.9024,3.0421,5.518,2.5071,4.0276,0.5989,0.5609,1.3459,1.1234,0.0007,0.0017,7.4173,0.4046,4.9771,1.584,3.0615,6.1854,0.3695,0.3171,4.4793,0.1194,8.3138,4.6228,6.0991,1.1552,0.6586,2.7946,0.6204,4.9289,4.8916,3.5183,1.0684,2.9608,2.9834,4.9087,1.7531,4.748,3.1476,1.6256,6.0558,3.3854,6.0843,0.6514,2.3895,0.3643,0.7998,4.9456,1.3951,0.7454,5.2684,3.6796,0.9705,5.9245,3.5908,1.024,1.0544,4.137,0.0217,1.369,1.0035]}
{"id":4935,"ended":true,"length":583,"text":"Table salt is made up of just under 40 % sodium by weight, so a 6 g serving ( 1 teaspoon ) contains about 2 @, @ 300 mg of sodium. Sodium chloride contains about 9 mg of sodium, so 0.0 mg ( 0.1 mg, 1 mg, 0.1 mg ). Sodium dioxide is an important component in cell growth, which is important since the ionic solvents in sodium chloride contain the ionic salt solution. Sodium chloride is the most preferred sodium salt, and sodium chloride is the most desired base water. Sodium chloride is one of the most valuable and cost effective sodium chloride additives. Sodium chloride is a high-fat salt. It contains about 14.5 mg of sodium per litre of water, and about 1.5 mg of sodium per litre of salt. Sodium chloride has a very high density and its water content is extremely high. The sodium chloride water content of the water is about 4 times higher than sodium chloride. Sodium is the most widely available and most toxic source of phosphorus, which may result in serious poisoning of human life. Sodium chloride is used extensively in agriculture where the use of sodium chloride, or sodium chloride water, is highly poisonous and must be kept at room temperature for a period of several days without drinking water.\n\nHigh Toxicity\nHEMI-based sodium salt is a more expensive source of salt than sodium chloride and is generally accepted as safe, although this can increase the amount of chloride which the customer consumes while he is consuming of the salt. Since sodium chloride is used for many of the other sodium-containing products which are needed in the production of high-fat butter, salt containing sodium salts can increase the salt content from 500 mg per litre to 500 mg per litre, and the salt content will be higher than 50 mg\/litre in this case. When using sodium chloride in the form of a sodium salt paste as the basis for the ingredients for the butter, sodium chloride is generally consumed less frequently of course.\n\nIn addition to sodium chloride, sodium chloride is employed as a base water in various types of dishes, including cheese, potatoes, bread and other food items. The above article discusses sodium chloride as a base water in the preparation of the flour, baking soda and the like. However sodium chloride contains salts which can cause stomach and respiratory injuries, which can lead to liver disease. This material is usually not readily obtained in bulk and the amount of sodium chloride in the solution is high, which affects the quality of the product after baking. This may result in the production of a low quality product, which may result in harmful bacterial growth on the flour, or may produce mild illness and\/or loss of the use of the flour.\n\nTherefore, the use of sodium chloride in butter or the like is desired for it can be easily manufactured under the conditions of the above-entrenched production of high-fat butter, cheese, potatoes and other foods. However, the use of sodium chloride in the preparation of the products of this subject subject of this article is an additional development which may be a disadvantage in processing.","token_len":628,"entropy":[11.5497,3.8124,5.1494,1.5547,0.1385,6.6259,6.8082,4.1909,3.9366,2.3213,4.2849,0.5157,1.6264,2.9665,3.5577,5.3401,2.7468,3.8091,3.6132,8.3449,4.678,3.1021,5.0812,1.5819,2.8033,11.4181,7.7138,8.7626,7.1702,1.6122,1.401,0.3412,0.9394,3.9364,2.0942,5.1741,0.8478,4.1384,1.8053,0.7678,0.167,1.622,1.6239,4.6551,0.1389,5.3834,1.1208,3.1539,2.359,0.0662,2.6003,1.5602,4.9966,1.835,1.1464,0.9203,2.1178,0.0645,1.1612,0.1067,5.2263,2.2142,6.7902,1.0726,4.1219,1.8869,1.4053,1.1967,5.6738,3.2453,1.3924,2.6007,1.2724,2.8385,5.561,2.5005,6.1269,1.3088,7.2056,2.5764,0.0037,1.4336,3.1089,0.6487,5.5609,3.165,2.5608,0.2636,2.9825,5.8694,0.8325,2.3065,0.9248,0.8909,3.2823,1.8125,6.3391,3.22,1.5987,2.4482,1.8352,3.8616,0.3895,0.8859,1.8016,0.7242,5.4544,6.8745,5.6948,1.0731,1.7402,0.3257,0.6201,4.6042,0.0585,0.1685,0.6896,5.3806,3.6017,3.9133,0.4039,2.343,3.5986,3.4104,1.1973,1.5943,0.1817,0.6536,2.3567,4.1625,1.4654,4.1662,4.9705,2.4257,1.3451,2.8253,2.5595,4.7441,2.7601,1.0202,2.176,0.5471,0.1487,2.1403,4.8244,0.0023,0.9863,0.2975,1.2031,1.6004,2.3271,2.5285,0.6764,1.0882,0.2419,0.4119,0.3148,0.4765,0.8791,0.0003,0.1056,4.9694,0.5548,0.8676,0.1304,2.7688,1.1922,2.9771,1.5791,4.8827,1.8755,4.8227,4.3025,0.6123,0.4173,4.8129,0.728,0.3956,2.3292,2.4043,0.2894,5.4685,0.5511,1.5285,2.1295,2.3914,1.8096,1.2783,3.4861,2.934,1.7877,0.0683,3.3053,0.0476,1.2481,1.2214,4.6125,2.5963,1.1824,3.3836,4.0571,3.1233,1.526,6.7796,3.8459,0.0377,7.3673,1.9319,1.4458,4.4902,4.2969,0.0585,3.2043,5.0224,2.3323,3.2692,4.4651,0.3567,1.7274,0.3429,0.6213,2.6189,3.6881,0.5501,4.0054,5.6977,2.3452,2.8686,0.069,1.8155,0.1388,4.7172,3.6186,1.8052,0.7801,4.4621,0.682,0.554,3.553,5.6998,2.3712,5.3264,0.0755,4.2225,3.7476,2.7044,0.0511,2.2478,2.4785,2.9422,0.0538,2.4752,0.6055,5.446,5.4063,1.8877,0.2911,2.6905,0.0123,6.0529,6.9053,0.8829,1.853,19.529,7.1492,3.8707,2.2031,5.5712,2.4808,3.7506,1.2089,2.0903,5.5969,3.9796,3.5819,0.0967,5.7511,0.6816,0.8583,0.0512,2.5756,1.3289,3.6346,4.0052,0.6852,1.0509,3.3082,2.5333,4.2438,3.5409,4.5592,0.562,4.2424,0.072,4.4503,5.1231,4.6197,6.0413,3.6154,5.3521,5.0961,1.6546,2.4546,7.684,1.7594,1.4193,0.2856,5.2666,0.6537,0.0678,0.4409,3.2768,2.6902,2.1415,3.4515,0.2186,4.0922,0.9308,2.5132,1.0574,1.6156,3.7404,0.6659,6.2595,1.5462,1.4214,4.1163,0.0758,5.2616,0.852,2.167,7.1889,0.5965,4.5283,6.3468,0.8261,4.7527,2.1106,3.5661,0.244,4.6131,0.5538,5.5833,6.4937,0.9278,1.7461,1.076,0.0002,0.6144,3.6546,0.1094,0.3446,0.0631,0.0005,2.3005,2.193,2.4633,1.5372,0.7826,2.815,1.6515,2.5676,1.9814,6.4849,0.3359,2.8871,1.1,0.0004,3.7957,3.3279,0.8292,0.1843,4.5405,2.0663,0.8347,0.079,1.8564,1.5401,3.1653,0.0298,2.4914,5.0115,1.5783,4.7436,4.9896,2.6945,3.5557,0.68,1.7531,5.9024,2.5626,1.1733,1.3626,0.6694,3.5135,0.2058,1.3849,4.175,5.4344,4.9253,1.6176,7.8962,3.2982,0.9568,1.3799,0.0002,3.1818,2.0723,0.5334,2.7951,0.0797,0.3158,1.5759,0.245,0.8383,7.074,1.5008,0.5315,2.23,2.4322,2.5118,4.3425,3.3353,0.0064,4.4929,1.43,1.4131,5.0322,0.5729,4.5825,0.1884,3.7592,1.789,2.5864,3.0848,2.0851,0.4189,2.0608,5.9285,6.1761,2.2486,2.4719,0.0593,1.9019,0.5913,1.0963,0.4085,1.8487,2.0846,3.3716,0.0788,2.3749,5.3233,1.3414,4.8293,2.5403,1.5199,3.111,3.2299,0.3699,3.9802,3.8932,0.0342,6.4883,5.8861,1.3585,2.1072,1.6323,4.1375,3.8064,2.4985,7.8058,1.7504,2.1476,1.0754,1.7704,0.016,4.2949,2.0151,1.2301,3.7561,8.1832,0.9633,3.5306,3.7285,4.0857,4.7226,1.9937,3.9707,1.9219,3.3846,3.3264,0.557,0.9654,0.2977,1.9225,0.9269,4.7281,1.1235,4.6862,2.1497,2.1611,6.163,0.4237,2.2137,0.2319,0.1673,1.8765,6.785,4.6441,0.853,3.6609,3.4812,2.5137,0.0365,1.6694,4.2256,0.0431,2.2202,3.7544,1.3799,0.3609,2.0434,0.9699,1.3983,2.4689,0.0293,5.9516,5.2302,1.6582,3.1372,0.2586,5.9404,1.6694,3.1087,2.8601,3.7055,6.7037,4.3178,2.8768,3.512,0.0005,5.9065,0.0229,3.0206,4.5014,0.0753,0.5881,2.981,0.5443,0.9053,0.0002,6.8835,0.4374,1.8122,1.6501,0.0149,0.4492,0.0138,0.7672,4.5219,2.9301,3.9243,1.8105,1.0922,8.877,3.0513,5.9189,4.9445,1.4602,4.5497,7.5308,5.9634,1.2473,3.1736,1.5592,1.7474,2.3675,3.7429,8.0002,5.4265,5.4202,2.1319,2.0903,0.252,0.0337,0.2982,1.9723,3.4978,0.7286,0.9394,1.1256,0.8279,2.3133,0.4285,2.8409,0.1767,1.5858,1.898,0.0221,0.695,0.0204,0.6261,0.927,0.9755,0.0108,0.4475,5.8079,0.9119,2.1707,6.6288,6.7835,5.0673,1.4061,0.2793,1.0368,5.3155,3.0423,6.3392,2.2395,1.4389,1.4645,4.0415,4.5695,2.0314,6.4028,2.4301]}

{"id":3871,"ended":true,"length":620,"text":"At age 11, Bell became a vegetarian. In an interview with PETA, Bell stated, `` I have always been an animal lover. I had a hard time disassociating the animals from the animals, the plants and the vegetables. I didn't always appreciate what they were, the animals, the plants, the foods. Today, I think there are much, much better things that people are doing now, people being willing to give animals the food they need, and not just the meat. If we don't put everything out there, it will go out of our bodies into plastic containers, if animals and plants are in plastic containers. That's what's wrong with our country. We shouldn't be doing it, but we must.\"\n\nBell, in her interview. Bell is a member of the International Federation of Conservation Voters, a nonprofit organization that focuses on protecting public land and public health. Her vegetarian lifestyle is part of the \"endangered animals\" issue that people worldwide are concerned is causing problems that would make them uncomfortable eating animals.\n\nIn an interview, Bell states, `` I've been known to have a vegetarian diet in my life because I've lived in New York for a number of years. I have always been a vegetarian. I never really have been a vegetarian. I've always just been a big fan of nature. I have really enjoyed playing with nature. When I was growing up in New York where you have lots of birds, you can't really have natural gardens, you can't have nature gardens like nature gardens... All those natural gardens are just an ugly place to grow up. I was growing up in Queens and I grew up in Queens and I'm a big fan of nature.\"\n\nShe added, '' I actually believe in nature, and I think there's more than one way to live and enjoy nature. I've watched many documentaries to educate the public about nature, science, what nature is, how nature is. And I think that's what I was born of. I can see the benefits of it now, because I always knew how nature could be good for animals, and I never thought that it could be bad for people in the same way that it was bad for us humans. And it's good for people, because people don't have to think about animals in the same way that we do. They're not talking about animals like humans. They're talking about nature.\"\n\nA natural garden is a garden that grows plants and animals. In a gardening game or a sport, a grass is placed on a plant. For a person, a garden can be a backyard or a field. The plants can grow or turn into habitats and resources, making them more productive, beneficial and nourishing places for the animals. Plants are also a powerful tool for the production and cultivation of life. \"Our planet has been poisoned by the environmental industry,\" Bell states \".

{"id":3526,"ended":true,"length":602,"text":"Bonnet has been portrayed several times in literature. He is a major character in Tim Powers'On Stranger Tides, along with other famous piratical characters, particularly Blackbeard. In this novel, the main character is a former pirate, an old pirate, a sailor who is being turned into a mercenary by pirates, and is a pirate that was trained in sailing by the late king Charles II. \"A good example of being trained in sailing is the pirate who lost his arm and lost the strength to sail for England, and in that position, the captain and crew became very close friends and kept up a good and intimate friendship.\"\n\nOn Stranger Tides, he played two roles. One was as an officer (one was as merchant) that was often employed in the mercenary industry, but often as a pirate as to whom he really cared. The other has been a pirate who was known for his good moral sense. \"He was a real good fellow and a captain of ship, but the more the ship had to go against the English and the French, the worse it was. That is the reason he chose to come to us, with the exception of my own, or that of his associates.\"\n\nThis work is well placed in keeping with Tim Powers' vision as a mercenary. He is one of the strongest men the merchantman has ever heard as well as more than his predecessor.\n\n\"If you have seen the tale of On Stranger Tides you can understand that there's a lot going on.\"\n\nThe reason it is not mentioned in Tim Powers' writings is because most of us don't understand his approach at all. It might seem a bit naive and the author was afraid to mention such a huge subject again. However it is actually a very positive view.\n\n\"The pirate who lost his arm and lost the strength to sail for England, and in that position, the captain and crew became very close friends and kept up a good and intimate friendship.\"\n\nHe was also respected by the pirates for the skill he had at handling ships. \"For a pirate, and especially one in his crew, the best he could do was to be a pilot. So it is understandable that they were not able to have enough confidence in his abilities to sail through the battles.\n\nBut he was also in command and he knew his sailors very well\".\n\nThe main point about On Stranger Tides is that we didn't understand why he chose that particular ship and not any other ship. This is why Tim Powers believes that any ship that had a captain in a commanding position can be regarded as \"a pirate\" even if that is not really the case.\n\nIn To Stranger Tides, he talks about how in the end the pirate (or the pirate who was his captain) did everything he could in order to keep his ship off course and the crew from sinking.\n\nTim Powers was a pirate. He had enough good reason to be an adventurer. He was a captain and he didn't see anything wrong with that. What has been done with him is really shameful.","token_len":628,"entropy":[7.781,5.4634,1.7844,7.5849,7.6587,0.0175,0.8333,7.4777,2.5876,2.8971,1.203,2.16,5.8923,1.9479,0.1504,8.0687,8.1643,0.1955,12.6389,4.0694,0.9879,0.2708,1.2418,6.1865,0.0078,4.2917,5.0177,12.0666,2.7736,1.4997,2.2604,6.8646,6.6336,1.4777,1.0939,2.2869,3.6912,2.978,0.3003,2.4269,3.4133,0.6289,1.0626,1.7847,5.1083,0.8085,2.2127,5.085,2.6555,1.2743,1.3257,1.7765,4.616,2.8752,2.3729,4.961,5.3594,0.2991,0.2466,5.4596,1.1466,3.4713,1.693,0.4868,3.2432,3.7786,2.1295,4.9173,2.9697,4.5768,2.4958,4.7205,2.9238,1.8449,4.8232,4.5675,5.5202,1.7999,0.7452,6.7245,4.2527,4.8214,4.4043,0.4671,6.6073,3.7421,0.6913,0.8492,0.8734,1.7172,2.4715,2.1261,5.2061,0.3138,4.4893,1.9758,3.1156,2.8796,6.5772,0.531,1.2152,3.2221,3.4496,2.0627,1.908,4.1019,2.7038,5.9123,1.6055,2.5185,3.245,3.6519,1.7838,4.6014,3.1259,4.7022,2.0717,2.2329,5.2916,4.0428,1.1686,1.1928,4.8656,6.4187,0.8858,2.0034,1.4069,0.0093,4.791,0.335,0.004,0.001,0.4618,3.824,5.655,4.9329,2.636,2.1367,1.9144,0.8965,2.8162,2.4257,4.0445,4.6389,4.4322,4.3731,1.9792,6.5413,1.8885,5.1943,1.827,5.1456,4.8489,2.1386,1.4601,6.2888,3.6838,1.3554,2.7122,3.8769,3.2515,0.521,1.9881,4.7476,8.1612,4.2219,1.2026,6.7723,3.6215,0.7056,1.356,0.1585,7.6132,0.4496,1.9604,1.9755,1.2351,1.4236,5.2774,1.5532,0.5515,4.4971,5.9897,3.3975,2.1368,3.4072,2.1945,1.0231,1.4274,5.0358,1.5721,4.4831,2.3022,1.7307,6.0535,2.5914,5.0335,1.5627,1.626,3.8918,4.3452,3.6482,4.8357,4.8205,1.7716,3.5577,3.4306,1.4378,5.8888,3.1057,1.3214,3.9781,0.582,0.246,3.8927,1.256,0.9663,2.7556,4.5057,2.0767,2.3765,2.691,2.1268,5.1678,0.5377,4.48,0.9317,4.2137,1.8742,5.664,1.5727,5.5659,0.0934,5.9977,2.5368,3.9612,5.5192,3.7866,0.724,2.9464,6.2609,1.7643,0.7065,0.0002,4.0949,6.0485,1.2773,4.9736,5.4105,1.4091,7.5324,0.1083,6.1833,0.0687,0.2559,4.8813,4.4026,0.7411,3.5552,1.7364,1.9422,1.6722,4.2578,0.0768,0.4007,5.7047,2.9402,3.7497,6.4337,3.5763,1.1239,0.3872,6.6081,7.3591,2.3551,0.0935,7.3224,1.4306,3.2239,7.499,1.0094,2.4178,0.0002,3.2004,4.4276,1.1768,2.9152,3.7518,1.5893,6.0633,0.7621,6.9726,0.0055,0.0084,0.0026,2.6847,3.1845,3.0424,1.3983,3.1679,4.1482,0.8933,1.4809,1.8176,0.0132,3.7334,0.6402,0.0003,2.7907,6.508,3.8565,1.0292,3.6396,3.737,0.7411,3.3161,0.2528,0.0684,4.4354,0.3077,0.9972,5.3986,0.7905,4.0771,2.1393,0.0008,2.9276,3.4332,6.1241,5.3708,0.2556,0.3077,2.9162,5.2467,2.0149,3.2662,0.934,5.3518,3.4489,5.0509,3.6826,3.7251,5.1032,1.4311,3.9713,5.2844,0.7954,4.9124,2.8832,8.8588,1.1062,2.2683,4.5434,0.7501,4.7189,1.9479,1.6664,5.9231,5.9479,1.7677,1.3093,0.0002,1.3832,2.1291,3.7064,2.0021,0.9555,0.0287,0.0352,0.5309,0.0594,0.0421,0.0263,0.0461,0.0052,0.0339,0.0136,0.7237,0.2766,0.054,0.0017,0.0071,0.029,0.0456,0.0218,0.0134,0.0066,0.0192,0.0124,0.0084,0.0013,0.0671,0.0068,0.0086,0.0053,0.0088,0.0031,0.0007,0.0411,0.7001,0.1946,0.0002,3.7293,1.7137,1.7099,7.0006,1.5105,1.3002,2.5444,2.8285,4.1742,4.2514,0.7583,1.7293,2.7018,5.0191,3.3193,0.957,1.6441,4.515,2.2642,1.0501,1.144,5.0804,2.6531,2.3661,4.7323,2.04,6.9425,0.3294,2.4465,3.2332,4.9113,0.8166,0.1516,0.4382,0.4809,2.8793,1.983,6.5614,1.5333,4.5159,3.2011,1.8461,5.8691,0.4999,3.6842,2.596,2.8406,3.3716,0.009,4.0613,5.3145,3.6515,0.4571,2.3602,2.1705,1.2074,3.4908,4.5425,0.8062,6.3646,2.7074,4.3907,0.0002,4.5255,2.7314,1.2251,1.0809,5.3489,3.7582,3.6988,2.2427,3.1373,3.0697,5.2279,2.4942,0.0113,7.506,0.2742,0.0001,2.3694,3.3748,3.1891,3.3179,1.7357,0.0001,0.0023,0.002,0.2772,0.4144,4.866,6.3738,0.0007,3.8729,3.9224,2.3389,1.3473,4.505,3.8199,3.5765,2.9556,3.7031,3.4182,0.3305,2.5824,0.7785,3.3574,0.9251,3.4039,3.1258,0.1922,5.3597,0.7134,5.7663,2.5375,1.6638,3.2346,1.6749,2.7156,3.2931,4.1877,4.4648,0.6101,4.1,0.9513,4.9921,0.0571,3.5762,2.2728,1.1266,2.6206,3.1882,0.5833,2.9459,3.7841,1.2595,5.5035,1.267,0.2917,0.1761,0.7511,0.0002,3.2716,8.0519,7.4399,0.054,0.0023,0.2972,2.4835,4.9849,0.2055,2.2001,4.3754,1.2701,3.2871,1.96,2.245,5.2824,2.219,3.0157,1.4463,1.7536,2.2183,4.538,1.4384,0.1952,4.0288,4.0409,1.7557,0.1276,4.1706,0.3424,0.0406,3.4665,1.3018,1.6657,6.9459,4.5799,1.6125,3.8545,3.2948,2.8951,4.2689,0.6907,1.3037,0.0001,5.0648,0.299,3.0896,2.0066,2.2185,2.2427,1.2355,3.0166,6.4247,4.1902,4.0986,0.4465,2.2416,3.8526,3.5105,0.9378,1.205,1.2586,1.3211,2.9212,2.0129,1.3843,4.6516,0.0007,5.5758,3.8458,0.3076,0.1072,1.3685,0.208,5.3196,5.6316,1.6689,5.1041,3.8895,1.7577,1.2156,5.3808,5.5188,0.6468]}
{"id":3854,"ended":true,"length":545,"text":"The first Eagles Boys store opened in Albury, New South Wales in 1987, a venture spearheaded by businessman Tom Potter in partnership with his mother, Barbara Potter, who guaranteed a $50,000 dollar deposit, was the first location operated by a jeweller who would later become the head of the business, while the majority of jobs would come in-store, the store was built through \"A New Way To Work Out\", a labour-intensive business model with minimal product offerings.\n\nIn 2007, Potter bought out Albury Pharmacy and set up a chain of jewellers, which by that time had expanded to 3,000 shop fronts and hundreds of open-air shopping malls in Australia and had expanded into almost 20 other Australian retail chains in recent years.\n\nThe store on the corner of Westmead Street in Ayr has become a leading market for the business, with many of its workers from out of town who travel to Australia to run and operate shops, including Melbourne and Port Adelaide's stores, as well as Victoria, New South Wales and New South Wales.\n\nIn an industry that has struggled with innovation and costs, the shop has had to learn new tricks, like making every store in Australia run at full capacity, despite being located near the busiest shopping centres.\n\nAerobox\n\nBy 2016, the company had grown from about 2,000 employees to 17,000 at a cost of almost $75 million.\n\nThe store on the corner of Westmead Street in Ayr was chosen by Ben Wyatt, head of research and advisory at Aerobox Australia Ltd.\n\nBen Wyatt says the Australian economy is the most competitive in the world right now and in Australia the company works with the country's biggest firms to create a market-leading offering.\n\nIt is currently being developed by two companies with some of the country's largest investors, including American developer and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who also works at Aerobox Australia Ltd.\n\nAccording to Ben Wyatt it now has more than 500 associates worldwide.\n\n\"We're very proud that Aerobox Australia Ltd is investing in Melbourne in the next generation of stores,\" Ben Wyatt said.\n\nThe company's Australian sales director, Steve Smith, said the site looked great in the new way it would be run, providing the biggest supply of jobs possible.\n\n\"As with other regional stores at this level, Aerobox Australia Ltd has a long history of producing an excellent product and an excellent customer experience,\" Smith said.\n\nThe store will be open from 07:00-17:00 on a day-in-day-out basis, making every day the first day

{"id":4358,"ended":true,"length":592,"text":"A key thrust of Malaysia's case was that the British had received explicit permission from Johor to build a lighthouse on Pedra Branca, which proved that the British had recognised Johor's sovereignty' and not on the British soil itself.\nIn a letter to the Prime Minister, the US State Department has sought to clarify details of two incidents, one in Johor, and one in Kuala Lumpur.\nThe former happened in March 2010 and the latter, in July 2011, happened in the summer of 2012.\n\"If Mr. Trump continues to oppose this [the US administration's] support for the US and Malaysia, and if he continues to try to derail our efforts to move JK to the U.K., then I must express my opposition to the United States and the Malaysia government's use of military force to coerce JK to withdraw from the UK and its sovereign sovereignty in an effort to secure the independence of the island,\" Washington's letter stated, referring to Johor.\n\"The U.S. has consistently maintained both a commitment to Singapore and Malaysia's sovereignty in accordance with international law,\" the letter continued.\nThe letter further stated that the British has had \"obligations, contracts and obligations to safeguard the security and stability of the island, as well as support and ensure that the Island is safely, economically and strategically governed.\"\nIn February 2020, the British Embassy in Kuala Lumpur released a statement expressing support for the administration. \"In fact, we are delighted that this administration has now provided the US with the necessary legal support to help build a bridge of trade between the US and Malaysia which enables the island to remain free and free from potential terrorist attacks and the threats the United States might pose to these lands,\" the embassy statement quoted the UN secretary-general as saying.\nThe UK also stated that the American and Malaysian governments had made many steps to strengthen their ties, including facilitating a dialogue between the island's government and US allies.\n\"We are ready to continue working with the UK to resolve these conflicts and cooperate in any way possible to find a solution to the Malaysia and US problems in any way possible.

{"id":4361,"ended":true,"length":590,"text":"None of the conduct by the United Kingdom and Singapore that led to the ICJ to conclude that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca applied to Middle Rocks. Since Johor held the ancient city of Pahang, it is safe to assume that a settlement was made in the island country to prevent the construction, and the building of the mosque itself in the area, of which Pedra Branca is now located.\n\nThere are no records of the trial occurring outside of the Court. However, the records, if they exist, would indicate that this case was fought through the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Malaysia. In terms of evidence, both Singapore and Malaysia held their depositions about the case in court (one was held from the UK but had jurisdiction in Singapore because the Malaysia jurisdiction was only on the Isle of Man).\n\nSince the trial has been held outside of Malaysia, there has been no further evidence to support the notion that the UK was involved. Even in the absence of evidence, and because the evidence against Singapore has been rejected, there has not been any evidence of any further conflict between the parties since that day.\n\nThe evidence against Singapore, or Malaysia for that matter, was suppressed and there has indeed been no further evidence of the other parties in any dispute.\n\nThe evidence collected by the Court, and the evidence in respect of the Malaysian case (there are no records of Singapore or Malaysia holding hold of hold), were all rejected, either in the Malaysian proceedings and therefore held out until after Mr. S.N., who could not prove his innocence, was found guilty of the offence, or had pleaded not guilty and therefore the case was withdrawn.\n\nMalaysia, whose case had been dismissed, was acquitted of the offences and remanded to the British District Court in London where, on 22 September 2013, the Court of Appeal granted permission to appeal the Court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Court of Appeal rejected the UK\u2019s application to overturn the decision of the UK Court of Appeal (in which it reversed Malaysia\u2019s conviction for the offence of defilement), saying that the Court of Appeal recognised that Malaysia\u2019s possession of the mosque was sufficient for the conviction to proceed.\n\nThe Court explained, while Malaysia was entitled to pursue its case in trial in Britain and would be entitled to pursue the conviction of an offender elsewhere on either side of the Channel, it was at this Court that Malaysia, because of its status as an independent nation, could not move ahead with any appeal. This may have hindered the efforts of Malaysia in its appeal, since Malaysia\u2019s status as a free state could not be established at this Court, making Australia the only country to appeal against that decision.\n\nWe thus take the Court\u2019s decision in our favour and look back with wonder as to why the UK Court of Appeal rejected Malaysia\u2019s application to overturn the verdict of the British Court of Appeal.\n\nOne can only imagine how disappointed the UK and Malaysian courts are when such an appeal has been upheld by the Court of Appeal.","token_len":628,"entropy":[2.6534,1.2343,10.8785,4.4344,1.4276,5.0119,4.4333,3.2721,5.9739,3.3058,3.2887,0.1335,0.7034,8.3229,2.0582,8.0946,2.8647,0.5653,2.0072,1.9871,8.0428,5.0399,0.2424,15.1645,3.4765,8.7708,3.6765,10.3803,0.9178,11.9676,14.7426,1.796,5.7044,10.6862,1.4193,7.5898,1.7298,8.3427,3.3295,1.1872,3.9188,3.512,2.0852,1.4925,2.4845,1.1609,5.4703,0.0095,1.1102,0.1274,4.5977,6.1211,2.993,1.5227,1.635,1.5455,6.1939,6.177,3.5033,3.1797,1.448,4.9496,5.6177,2.4664,2.473,4.9715,0.6388,1.2609,6.0109,4.8351,4.5298,1.4473,2.9633,3.2398,3.0281,3.7346,2.47,0.006,0.2966,0.0001,1.0479,3.7389,1.5861,0.3559,1.0951,0.0159,4.3508,1.2741,2.9025,3.5717,0.568,1.7772,7.0392,5.2118,3.6386,1.2633,1.6547,6.3674,2.9556,2.6338,0.0402,1.671,5.8762,5.0759,3.6678,1.4621,0.9532,0.1206,2.4324,1.5484,0.1997,4.6439,2.3489,0.9721,5.9675,5.136,1.3709,4.5404,0.1787,2.0086,0.703,0.3742,0.6874,1.4144,0.8838,2.872,5.6742,0.0005,3.6819,0.4876,5.128,2.9126,0.1247,0.1215,6.2293,4.1387,7.3252,0.0091,6.6793,0.8836,3.0117,2.0985,3.9961,4.9459,4.9743,3.2994,1.67,5.8373,2.7777,5.1686,4.515,4.3302,5.904,1.2783,1.9849,5.9068,1.9731,6.0328,7.0911,0.8204,5.2844,4.7464,0.8882,3.9934,0.0415,0.4307,0.8789,1.6065,0.0002,5.5578,1.0272,1.9902,4.031,1.0749,1.874,1.7768,0.45,2.2835,0.322,2.0966,2.6553,0.2729,0.3882,3.9393,2.2663,2.2793,0.9734,0.6916,4.032,0.0689,0.9983,4.9666,2.7596,0.6962,1.4017,5.3489,3.3037,1.3455,1.3828,0.0016,1.6201,1.2261,4.8855,3.0193,1.471,2.2611,4.1594,1.2145,2.7449,0.704,5.2973,1.195,1.3911,2.2875,2.6381,0.0791,0.4892,1.5651,1.9492,1.52,4.0232,4.6953,1.4382,0.5633,2.9089,5.7339,3.4829,3.145,0.3087,0.7475,0.0002,1.8149,2.769,1.8936,0.5709,3.145,4.83,5.0651,3.1622,0.0533,0.0017,0.0456,2.3235,5.6027,3.1184,3.6204,1.9745,6.8817,0.0611,0.1947,0.872,0.2695,1.526,2.9503,5.1808,1.9293,3.2371,2.8225,5.0719,1.2554,1.0022,0.0002,1.7628,2.2935,7.2209,1.2017,0.6221,3.1533,3.0422,2.0626,1.4781,1.2549,3.2344,3.9543,0.033,1.2214,4.1222,2.1655,4.3733,5.3678,1.7723,1.0637,3.2414,0.3867,4.7715,2.2859,0.1462,3.8382,9.3349,4.3012,11.0755,2.9566,3.0185,3.681,5.1184,3.1332,4.3594,2.4369,1.3744,5.3507,5.7774,4.9444,5.3764,4.8168,4.6034,5.4253,2.5112,8.4624,1.1681,4.4165,2.5875,6.7565,3.5908,2.5262,6.1664,0.5159,5.3505,2.3871,3.3761,0.6679,1.4299,2.7444,0.7126,1.1801,2.2541,2.6376,2.6343,0.4354,5.0705,6.4135,1.9607,0.0027,3.5879,4.8302,3.1215,2.0302,0.8568,4.1514,0.6746,0.6712,0.0001,6.4062,0.016,0.0767,2.3601,5.9551,3.2939,3.2317,0.405,2.074,1.3122,2.3972,5.9182,1.1335,0.5467,4.482,2.5243,4.2293,0.0024,0.715,1.0453,4.2631,2.843,0.1701,2.0379,2.1741,2.6084,3.4715,2.0172,5.1903,2.4787,3.9963,0.0384,1.1779,2.524,2.1302,0.1258,4.1356,5.4577,0.6825,3.4727,1.1435,4.4131,14.2686,11.7347,5.1187,0.2732,1.7627,0.8936,0.0001,1.6051,2.1296,0.5821,0.0171,4.6002,0.7107,6.5989,10.7082,0.184,0.006,2.188,1.2,5.5291,0.3602,1.4349,0.7695,0.1131,4.237,2.0629,0.1187,0.0216,3.5435,3.2474,1.7827,1.8748,5.1053,4.0582,4.5716,0.0096,0.0008,2.5683,2.8036,0.9027,1.4808,1.2024,5.2649,3.4436,0.0479,3.3988,3.8419,0.454,1.0884,2.8539,0.9557,0.0121,6.7771,0.689,1.8545,5.3012,0.004,0.0036,6.6425,0.0836,1.0147,3.9814,1.3741,4.6133,2.2892,0.8563,5.4483,3.1345,2.55,0.7885,0.9671,0.0001,1.1931,1.0554,6.7892,3.5378,6.0555,5.6709,2.0067,3.5219,0.0301,5.427,1.6641,1.5625,1.6025,7.9279,2.248,4.8161,2.6522,4.7686,1.7025,0.5243,0.034,2.8032,1.5373,5.4207,3.3056,5.0103,4.3078,6.0841,4.2931,6.7184,1.4437,0.5761,0.2167,3.6589,1.1774,1.6663,1.7948,5.8209,1.8371,5.0226,1.4604,1.3082,3.8695,4.8228,0.6089,0.5539,4.1293,0.2081,1.8726,1.1306,2.3442,0.4297,2.0042,1.0616,5.4284,3.2563,0.484,3.4897,4.9845,1.2218,3.1935,5.9065,1.0772,7.0366,1.1467,5.9445,0.2779,1.2389,2.4304,2.5178,1.534,1.4523,2.8702,2.1405,5.7062,0.0048,0.0013,4.1392,0.367,1.2789,4.0918,2.3432,3.845,0.6652,0.6069,3.4107,3.7929,1.6002,0.5485,2.0999,6.0012,6.2321,2.7447,0.6359,1.4892,1.6053,5.5058,3.2803,4.2524,0.8083,0.3238,0.438,0.0001,5.5126,6.0411,5.1294,0.7616,1.9674,3.1743,0.0159,0.0087,0.6441,1.9366,5.8786,2.5123,1.5715,5.6815,5.4066,3.7214,4.7925,3.7655,0.5919,1.6795,1.1414,3.0252,2.0959,0.3196,0.0031,3.2135,0.7914,1.7915,0.0012,0.0041,0.9337,0.5296,1.341,0.3229,4.3308,0.6122,0.1659,1.3826,0.7475,0.0559,0.0087,1.2294,0.6052,0.0001,6.3024,2.6621,1.2633,2.1927,1.7309,5.2429,1.4628,2.7051,2.5943,3.5819,3.0759,3.4219,2.2738,4.3995,2.0997,1.4821,3.1811,0.6863,5.4179,1.3885,0.5849,1.0427,0.3075,0.0118,0.5777]}
{"id":2445,"ended":true,"length":489,"text":"Michigan participated in the 2013 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament at the United Center in Chicago. As the # 5 seed, they defeated Penn State in the opening round on March 10. Michigan dominated the game as their first four attempts of a season ended by an error, including a double-double, against Penn State. Three consecutive trips to the state championship were their first since 2008. Michigan now have a season-best 24-4 overall record (10-0 Big Ten). Michigan will host North Texas at 6 p.m., Sunday, March 15 at the John H. Wilson Center on the campus of Southern Michigan. The first match-up in the tournament is scheduled for 7 p.m., Sunday, March 17 at the George Gorman Memorial Arena and 10 a.m., on the home court of the Maryland Huskies. The other matchup is planned for 7 p.m. on the home court of Maryland.\n\nMichigan also made a historic NCAA Tournament appearance in 2013 by clinching their first conference tournament berth since 2007, which would have been their second appearance since the 2007 tournament. Michigan went 16-2 with a 7.5 win differential, including wins over Purdue and Tennessee. Indiana, Illinois, Maryland and Michigan State all played their second-most efficient quarters in the tournament, including the first ten minutes of the half in OT.\n\nIn addition to an all-time record 17-9 overall record, Michigan won all four major tournament games that year. In both of their victories they were tied with Alabama, Wisconsin and Michigan State for only first place. Michigan would return to the NCAA Tournament in 2018 for the first time since 1990, when a program record was broken by the conference loss to Duke. The Spartans also were the only school to have won the Big Ten Tournament this year.\n\nMichigan and Michigan State qualified for two Final Four appearances to open the season.

{"id":2669,"ended":true,"length":552,"text":"Le Tr\u00e9sor De Rackham Le Rouge began serialisation as a daily strip in Le Soir from 19 February 1943. The title of the new adventure had been announced in an advertisement in the newspaper, and subsequently became known as \"Le Rouxle\" a month into its publication, before the publication of the second volume of the series Le Rouxle in 1946. As the title is an ironic \"foul word\" (see Roux Le Rouge; The Tr\u00e9sor De Rackham; Le Roux Le Rouge) it has been said that the title is \"trivial and useless\" if the title is translated in french, and that \"the meaning of 'Le Rouxle' is very simple and easy to understand\", the term \"foul word\" and the title Le Rouxle are all translated as \"dirty word\". The name has become a trademark of Le Rouxle magazine, and a \"racy erotic picture\" that also bears images of pornography. Le Rouxle and its publication in 1954 have also been a phenomenon in France, due to their wide audience.\n\nLe Rouxle was also a popular tourist attraction in the area, and for generations of French, visitors and visitors to the city experienced the rich cultural, cultural, educational and artistic traditions of the town where it is located. The Le Rouxle hotel in the town of Aix-l'Engle is home to a series of cultural attractions, such as the Le Rouxle and Rouxlelele Theatre (pictured above), Le Rouxle Cinema and of the Le Rouxle and Rouxlele film department. It hosted the Grand Prix du Tour in 1954, where the \"champion\" in the category was Bruno Besson, and the \"main\" category was the Le Rouxle restaurant, and was also known as the \"Chez Besson restaurant\". In 1962, it was sold to a group of children's clubs and the club changed its name. From 1991 to 1994, Le Rouxle was home to a series of events celebrating French culture, and in 2003, it hosted the first event of its kind in North America, in the \"Festival de Vines\" (Dance at the Rides). In 1989, the Le Rouxle was converted into a hotel in an Italian hotel and in 1992, the hotel was converted into a leisure resort. From 2000 onwards, Le Rouxle was open to a wide audience, and attracted an estimated 1.6 billion tourists and visitors. In August 2016, its sales increased in a year's time, from US $4.8 million to US $6.6 million.\n\nLe Rouxle opened in 2008. In 2017, after a three-year absence, the restaurant was reopened, with a new name and a new \"fictional\" theme. Although the name of the restaurant is not as popular in France as the place itself, this may suggest that it is an attempt to change a cultural image. In 2011, the restaurant was closed for renovation, and the restaurant reopened in 2018.","token_len":629,"entropy":[9.4443,5.8723,0.6492,6.7928,13.5405,2.6763,7.3949,7.6895,10.1778,8.8652,3.9663,4.4464,0.7848,7.4075,6.9421,1.521,4.895,7.7856,0.4384,5.7654,5.6111,3.5436,5.3347,1.1524,1.5355,4.8608,2.5066,0.562,4.6875,8.75,5.1211,1.0755,5.1856,1.6007,4.3497,3.9231,1.6745,1.4721,3.5982,2.9696,2.59,6.4239,3.3299,2.6449,0.1714,1.5771,1.3482,4.7889,1.2496,6.3408,3.1572,6.6851,3.2787,6.673,2.4703,1.889,2.7105,4.5448,1.9869,3.0086,0.474,0.941,3.1435,2.2928,1.5138,0.8895,2.1027,7.1274,2.5409,0.0296,0.3744,3.9139,4.8722,0.2565,4.5265,1.7024,2.2533,6.5277,4.6439,4.2998,6.9363,4.7713,6.4907,3.9981,0.9017,3.1706,4.1529,10.7428,0.0762,4.7753,0.9928,6.3069,3.8312,5.0174,0.625,0.0315,0.5057,0.3952,0.0003,4.8466,2.3207,3.267,0.0048,2.0392,0.0605,2.2347,1.491,3.0368,1.3979,5.2495,0.3848,1.4966,1.8518,2.2602,2.597,4.8345,4.0881,0.0065,2.7472,5.6636,1.5071,6.1888,2.1847,2.8891,0.9591,4.6052,2.7165,6.5603,2.0529,1.4467,1.2698,3.0044,2.0023,5.2577,0.5647,3.4305,2.6473,0.3494,0.006,0.0648,0.0771,0.6766,4.1611,3.8405,1.9496,4.2832,0.121,0.6214,3.2991,4.534,6.0214,1.7474,3.2338,0.0812,0.1783,0.1083,4.9432,1.2254,2.71,6.6714,0.2492,0.0026,0.0336,2.1161,4.5427,4.9306,1.9333,0.673,7.0369,2.1335,0.873,1.6947,4.5631,4.3153,2.8315,1.6108,3.1502,0.7332,1.6966,0.8145,0.0017,0.1863,4.6496,1.1648,1.4603,3.7631,4.3245,5.4047,3.773,6.6929,5.2926,0.729,4.8418,5.329,5.5635,8.3187,0.1812,6.6938,1.3582,3.0868,0.2793,0.0016,0.0159,4.8162,1.9325,5.283,2.9627,5.8171,3.628,3.2728,0.7725,3.9067,5.1095,1.2114,0.8322,1.0193,6.4865,0.267,2.5356,6.3036,5.2532,1.1669,2.1145,0.0254,2.2465,0.7135,0.002,0.0202,2.1398,3.0477,1.9861,2.3694,4.9129,0.796,0.9914,1.5032,4.9988,1.1738,1.6175,4.615,6.1669,3.1756,2.0565,3.8722,4.1279,4.611,1.4724,1.3903,1.0479,2.9488,5.4085,1.2759,5.5987,2.9836,3.6008,2.5562,1.7302,3.7978,0.3166,2.3553,3.9095,0.6162,0.703,3.4819,5.5768,1.3526,2.1478,0.8309,0.3151,1.5887,5.1016,0.6497,0.003,0.0401,5.8395,2.3256,1.5775,3.3521,1.8913,6.0993,1.4676,0.2034,5.4449,0.8831,6.9252,0.853,2.6912,4.6594,0.0567,2.0156,5.3058,0.0045,4.2744,2.6689,0.9127,2.7075,0.0027,0.7836,2.8211,2.0519,0.0054,0.2313,5.5741,7.0351,0.121,3.6272,7.7829,7.3015,5.1488,3.1084,4.8299,1.2679,1.0086,2.9304,1.0268,0.0031,0.1499,4.1102,1.9361,6.3398,4.6488,1.4469,0.4908,0.0017,0.0187,3.1735,1.4268,0.0054,0.0956,0.9788,7.2167,6.4349,0.7335,3.5403,6.1933,1.3812,5.9738,1.1845,1.8863,4.7785,3.0849,3.7022,0.814,4.5323,1.3383,5.1682,6.35,2.4669,1.007,4.1564,0.4647,5.092,1.7323,5.7283,4.3619,5.404,1.0899,2.3885,1.2101,1.9099,6.7209,2.687,2.8416,0.5489,2.0494,1.7236,0.4059,0.0015,0.0269,5.1318,1.6991,3.7313,3.1045,1.773,2.7245,0.1673,1.0228,1.4082,4.9111,3.4715,3.8661,2.4323,3.3524,0.8948,2.4099,4.0356,0.5855,3.3785,0.6371,4.2374,0.5697,2.8928,3.3477,0.2237,6.365,2.744,4.6591,2.5137,3.3955,4.1888,5.9869,0.249,0.0419,3.5273,5.9007,7.285,1.4174,2.4641,0.3405,1.4532,0.0261,0.0009,0.0051,1.2923,5.4655,0.0441,1.6478,3.4527,0.0022,3.1311,5.4907,2.898,0.7819,0.9616,2.6809,2.7303,3.5749,0.8164,1.6681,3.0495,0.7968,3.1034,5.277,0.7404,0.8238,0.1546,0.7841,5.1223,0.3169,1.2227,2.9929,1.8443,3.6701,4.507,3.3527,1.1454,4.7969,6.8633,1.4445,1.919,5.5896,5.1186,4.0652,0.7913,4.4881,5.7511,3.2721,2.0442,6.1935,0.1672,1.3668,2.5132,0.0481,0.001,0.0108,3.2627,5.603,0.2866,0.4826,3.1046,2.5975,4.9481,4.4756,3.8715,2.7385,2.9213,3.3569,0.6054,1.1795,1.4495,0.8592,1.6391,0.1638,0.3241,6.7325,2.2234,0.9974,4.536,3.1138,4.1802,0.161,1.1466,0.0082,0.0008,0.007,1.6097,4.6262,0.5472,5.0349,1.1157,3.735,0.8883,1.2347,6.1265,3.4897,1.9476,2.5285,0.8015,2.4196,4.1728,3.6239,3.6311,0.7605,1.7131,2.0972,6.5224,4.0508,0.1658,4.3091,6.2407,2.4769,4.6612,3.3768,3.2581,4.969,0.0503,1.3687,2.996,5.1832,3.0221,3.2828,0.386,2.5764,0.8035,0.595,0.3869,0.1128,2.2214,0.2405,2.2753,0.0162,0.595,0.9138,0.0003,1.6399,0.1271,0.0009,0.0079,5.217,1.0619,5.7488,2.3282,2.3684,3.366,0.1922,5.1285,1.8599,3.6504,0.4575,0.2175,3.2595,0.3254,1.0564,3.797,1.7273,2.6902,1.7967,1.8177,1.5736,1.2153,4.2124,2.0127,1.6309,0.695,4.9263,4.1138,6.7358,0.801,1.5769,0.7063,6.1394,1.2417,3.02,2.5641,0.2425,0.277,1.4303,2.2624,5.0147,2.8062,2.3689,0.8114,0.3567,2.3513,5.5728,2.142,0.6393,4.7648,4.7912,6.6415,0.4207,1.392,1.0126,3.6137,4.0277,0.3633,4.1248,4.241,4.597,3.6919,1.9336,2.2597,4.751,0.1201,1.0962,1.1656,1.029,3.8945,1.8136,2.798,1.0755,0.9459,1.5887,2.5876,3.5177,1.1377,1.9593,0.5314]}
{"id":4399,"ended":true,"length":585,"text":"The song was generally well received by music critics. In a review of the group's debut album Spice, Dev Sherlock of Yahoo! Music Radio called it a `` glossy ballad that is rich with soul.' \"\n\n\"The record includes a haunting score by an orchestra, the piano riffs, and the hauntingly catchy vocal effects of the vocal arrangements, the percussion and an electric guitar. But there are also notes of an underlying harmony; the notes come through not just the guitars, but the instruments, and the rhythm sheets.\"\n\nSome critics said Dev Sherlock performed too little, if at all.\n\n\"The song is simply too long and boring,\" wrote Janae Stoller of The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe album had two strong albums and was a huge cultural success. With nearly two million people tuning in on one song at a time, it earned about $1.2 million a year in ticket sales.\n\n\"Dev Sherlock is a classic in the songwriting and musical genre and has been a hit for many years,\" said Jeff O. May, a composer and vocalist for \"Love, Love, Love\" who wrote the album.\n\n\"The first two and a half tracks were filled with soulful, melancholy, upbeat music....The songs were so powerful that I was very happy that I got to hear them.\"\n\n\"Love, Love, Love\" is the first in a three-record deal to drop June 3. It's a follow-up to \"Love Me Like This\" last year, but also takes on the band's latest LP \"Tangerine,\" on the second album.\n\nAs for a third record by the band, The Beach Boys' \"Wicked,\" the album dropped in June of this year.\n\nThe Beach Boys have had some success in the music business, producing many songs to sell on their debut album, \"Wicked,\" which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nSinger Paul Williams, who had been working on a solo project for the group for more than a decade, wrote in his review of the album that \"love me like this\" \"wooos.\"\n\n\"Love, Love, Love\" is performed in English through a string of voices from the band's own vocalists and their own instruments, which they employ to express their songs. The singers were inspired by each other. Some of the original vocalists were from the band. Others sung by other members of the band.\n\n\"Love me like this,\" in a previous review, was seen as \"the most popular single of the night.

{"id":1902,"ended":true,"length":559,"text":"The anti @ - @ rape condom is another variation designed to be worn by women. It is designed to cause pain to the attacker, hopefully allowing the victim a chance to escape the humiliation of the sexual assault. The anti female condom has a much stronger anti-rape, and has won widespread acclaim, while being a complete barrier to sexual assault. The anti woman # is an anti \"gender neutral\" condom (so if I did my job properly I would be not wearing it ). And because the anti women condom is designed to be worn by women. It is designed to cause pain to the attacker and help the victim to escape the humiliation of the sexual assault. What is rape? Rape is an extreme sexual assault that occurs when the accused or sex offender has access and control to a private or intimate area. This type of rape occurs when you have access to a certain public space or public place with women. The typical victim of rape in the USA is raped by either a police officer or a person who is not in their family. These men often rape and kill women because they don\u2019t want to hurt them. Rape often occurs in any part of the world or in certain places of the world. Rape is also extremely dangerous where you live in the U.S. There is a much safer way to escape this type of rape than wearing a condom. I have no doubt the most reliable way to avoid going through rape at home is to use a condom. You can try out the anti female condom right here: https:\/\/sheriffs.com\/testa\/sex-rape- condom-to-try-out.html#r\n- Advertisement -\n- Advertisement -\n- Advertisement -\nNo one in the United States has the knowledge, skills and training to use a normal condom. It is not only safe but easy to use, too so many women wear them because they know they have access to the safe and confidential space. This condom has the right to be worn. I am of the opinion that the anti women condom is a vital part in avoiding sexual predators.\nFor more information visit my website www.antiwomen.ca\/about.html#. For more info call 1-800-668-2929.\nThe Anti Woman Condom is the most popular anti sexually transmitted disease prevention product in the United States.

{"id":2561,"ended":true,"length":581,"text":"Upon the outbreak of the Second World War the Australian government decided to raise an all @ - @ volunteer force for service overseas, due to the provisions of the Defence Act ( 1903) that would allow the Australian Army to have an all@ - @ contribution service overseas, regardless of what they are willing to do while overseas. #COP29 https:\/\/t.co\/O5GfWJ4iU \u2014 Malcolm Turnbull (@Malcolm Turnbull) October 24, 2019\nThe Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was among the very first to raise a voluntary Australian Army Corps, a service by Australian Forces that was later amalgamated into the Australian Army Corps.\nAs part of the Australia Army Corps, Australians were allowed to travel to Japan in order to receive a training and support work permit as requested. After the war, the Australian Army Corps was disbanded after a failed attempt to create a national military unit in Japan.\nOn October 25, 2001, in order for the Australian Prime Minister to declare the change in the military structure, there would have been no active service. The Government would therefore have to ask the Australian Prime Minister to waive the requirement, or at first only apply for an all and non-active service.\nREAD MORE: Australians being told to'stay home' when coronavirus outbreak is declared\nAustralia has been advised that voluntary service requirements (as per their country constitution) would have to be waived prior to the end of the war in order for the Australian military to be able to operate. This would need to be done in order for the Australian military to be able to operate to allow the Australian forces to continue to operate during the war.\nAustralia was advised by the Australian Government to defer the start date by the end of 2004 and to take into account the possibility of a second wave of coronavirus cases.\nREAD MORE: COVID-19: Australia registers almost 4.3 million new cases per day\nAustralia has been advised against the use of voluntary services of the Australian Government for the purpose of stopping the spread of Covid-19.\n\"The advice is to do your best to be as self-sufficient as possible in the activities of your local community on behalf of your local community as regards any Australian Government or government agency acting on behalf of any local business or organisation in which you would be working as a volunteer or an adviser on behalf of local community groups to engage with or to support local businesses, businesses, community organisations or individuals in any matter which affects an individual or local business of interest.\"\nThe Australian Government advised in a previous announcement that voluntary service training and support services would be available for those wanting to serve for 18 months and up, or for the whole duration of the war in the defence or civil service. The Australian Government was told by the Australian Government to defer it until \"as soon as medically sufficient advice has been given\" as the COVID-19 outbreak was believed to be imminent.\nAustralia had an agreement with the United States of America over the use of voluntary service training and support services but it was decided not to make such a voluntary service grant.","token_len":629,"entropy":[2.2367,5.8137,0.3093,1.0787,2.0725,0.1089,0.0007,3.3061,6.3937,1.4791,3.6636,0.3607,5.3867,4.2858,5.5506,15.4052,9.1934,5.0739,11.012,5.7431,3.2206,5.8707,4.2653,2.7338,7.1296,0.1005,1.041,10.6484,0.3003,0.5097,5.3036,1.4654,4.3132,11.491,3.0405,3.5234,2.9005,1.6875,1.8441,2.089,2.7153,0.2968,4.029,2.6163,2.3301,4.9217,2.5133,0.9255,8.1334,4.7209,2.0164,2.6416,6.14,0.0275,3.8137,3.6531,3.3037,4.7743,0.1141,1.0281,6.1512,1.5407,0.3482,5.6196,4.959,4.9668,6.8369,3.6874,0.0003,0.0147,0.0001,0.0001,0.0054,4.5999,3.7258,4.5957,3.9261,3.9252,3.799,3.954,4.4866,4.1171,9.4421,5.8832,0.3753,0.0215,1.8136,0.0,9.1246,0.0099,2.4759,3.24,0.0003,8.9392,0.1179,12.5148,2.4069,5.9597,0.0068,2.3254,1.3321,0.0086,0.1886,3.075,3.394,1.3973,6.1739,1.0547,0.9127,4.2969,4.1192,7.1841,4.9564,0.9279,4.8781,3.1425,3.6182,3.8613,6.4977,4.4396,4.4506,2.1601,1.7925,4.9085,6.3546,0.0033,0.0006,0.8946,0.3035,0.7585,1.2515,0.8783,1.0603,0.9297,4.4813,2.0034,0.0014,0.6256,6.2157,3.1981,0.2516,0.7462,4.803,1.3978,2.8876,0.1342,5.3179,1.2961,5.5793,3.2783,3.0067,0.01,3.4426,3.1922,3.7526,2.9505,3.6083,6.4425,1.2637,4.5202,7.8885,2.7424,5.0775,1.6601,1.9283,0.5311,1.1462,0.7127,0.7681,0.6336,0.9467,2.4338,3.7588,2.694,4.8443,0.8195,0.5757,4.4845,0.59,3.0454,2.754,4.7535,1.7945,3.4365,0.8779,0.5992,4.2306,2.4504,2.4915,0.2581,4.7723,0.1993,4.8278,4.4033,4.2124,0.628,0.6645,6.7971,0.0087,0.3661,4.5469,1.889,6.7976,1.0961,1.9048,2.774,3.2662,1.3554,5.2375,4.1287,1.0205,1.0373,3.8844,5.0634,2.3273,2.767,2.1383,4.0608,3.2505,5.5043,1.0725,1.6791,5.1365,0.904,1.689,4.9144,0.0125,0.5224,5.5897,0.6205,1.6598,4.1871,3.7225,3.09,9.3014,5.1106,5.199,0.8716,2.5126,2.1361,7.1562,6.4273,0.291,3.73,1.2228,1.241,0.6216,7.6156,0.0348,0.0821,5.6284,7.1097,3.5709,1.0906,12.0752,8.3339,5.705,7.6658,7.2782,5.4409,12.1476,5.6343,4.1283,2.4077,4.2337,2.8944,0.9124,3.9985,2.5742,2.2477,6.079,1.5046,5.8628,1.6264,6.1986,5.6627,3.5677,5.1337,4.2988,6.2662,5.2541,0.1501,2.3801,3.1206,0.676,0.1318,0.8111,4.5074,0.0045,1.0509,3.4935,0.0084,0.755,2.1863,3.2409,0.6366,1.1166,0.9293,0.8795,2.8213,0.163,1.3768,1.4712,0.0125,2.9116,1.8402,3.2466,1.9307,5.8631,0.0672,0.3659,0.9142,1.8628,2.1889,0.7568,0.5624,0.5484,1.5373,0.0994,1.3063,0.1335,0.0172,1.6064,5.2661,5.454,1.3862,0.6518,4.6817,0.1274,2.2904,1.0718,1.6714,4.5545,0.4143,1.1896,0.3867,0.3349,3.254,3.1138,3.5228,2.4802,0.851,1.5942,1.2251,1.8815,6.3096,1.1218,5.3017,2.0681,5.3484,2.1076,0.2498,0.0017,4.7805,2.6993,1.9272,4.0113,3.5795,0.362,0.7792,3.8723,0.5899,1.7856,4.5639,4.0919,0.0611,4.25,0.0016,0.0525,3.6594,1.9913,0.8854,4.393,0.0097,0.0022,8.1434,6.7645,4.9347,7.5907,4.0877,3.713,10.3112,6.7746,3.7059,3.7264,2.5831,0.5065,2.9677,0.5432,2.7253,2.3237,0.8369,2.7082,1.7551,1.5634,0.9074,6.6865,2.3586,1.5859,0.0175,3.1619,2.7283,5.8109,1.6299,0.8143,3.5292,2.7927,1.372,3.1627,0.0217,5.5714,2.2781,0.8246,0.0147,12.3728,3.0924,1.716,0.0916,1.3705,1.4861,3.5234,1.7797,6.4991,2.378,2.4141,3.246,2.9953,1.6281,0.2312,3.9563,2.0728,5.0203,0.6165,0.3426,0.2057,0.2139,2.1906,2.1275,5.8874,1.0924,1.0257,3.6311,1.5475,6.1855,2.6869,0.0026,1.1038,2.1357,1.51,3.3277,6.2734,4.1388,6.2012,1.8137,3.7172,2.9095,2.2326,4.7567,1.7403,0.1614,0.0052,3.1606,3.1032,6.456,1.3946,2.3107,3.2879,3.1947,0.3582,4.1798,1.0863,5.0459,3.4268,0.718,2.0021,2.7764,5.1167,4.9807,4.3447,0.3085,0.0057,4.7492,2.8304,3.8663,4.3328,5.2626,2.3617,2.7385,3.1542,2.9402,1.922,3.73,2.3762,4.5448,1.5667,4.5624,1.3062,1.2817,2.5629,2.0054,3.0675,4.1351,2.6969,4.2167,5.3529,2.6699,1.182,3.0918,2.1182,4.5276,5.9427,3.8843,0.2828,1.7724,1.2885,0.3212,3.8184,3.5497,3.0254,5.1686,4.7442,0.4845,2.4832,0.8934,6.684,2.0237,0.4957,2.2708,0.9686,0.7227,2.186,1.9123,2.9082,5.2385,0.0911,3.1136,5.1203,6.2385,0.0795,3.47,4.2601,2.4174,3.2944,1.8917,3.0239,5.3314,3.4535,0.1299,0.6317,1.6261,2.785,2.9104,7.6681,5.9463,5.6141,0.5019,1.4834,2.9151,1.5468,0.1765,3.5962,3.6673,2.6799,0.3617,0.6194,0.2553,1.6221,3.8838,5.9792,1.1944,5.7091,5.07,0.6348,0.0086,9.5218,6.1859,6.3484,2.2223,0.0488,1.3744,2.1753,3.9998,3.217,6.9752,0.1752,0.4067,0.0306,1.1447,1.5886,5.144,0.0361,0.8969,3.0845,0.1977,0.291,2.8254,3.1629,5.0375,4.4645,0.2993,0.6774,2.4954,0.6569,2.2206,0.0432,5.7688,0.7214,2.4035,0.0186,1.5317,1.2169,1.6426,0.3541,0.1546,0.1069,5.3232,2.5512,0.9025,3.3448,2.8963,0.0043,4.3207,2.0178,0.9839,5.1813,0.2959,7.1981,1.2891]}
{"id":533,"ended":true,"length":608,"text":"Season 3 premiered on May 13, 2012 after vague details surfaced about the show's spring return on the Twitter account of sister wife Robyn Sullivan Brown. The twenty one episode season mainly focused on Robyn and her new husband, Jay, who has a daughter who is being turned into a babysitter, and while they have two sons, their daughter-in laws, their son Ryan and daughter Katie, have a different side to them. Robyn had said that she and her husband would like to leave the show and they did not mind the fact that their new daughter had become a little girl. However, when they got to filming and it was revealed that he was working on her new husband's little girl, the network got involved to try to cover the show's events. However, they did not last as they were filming for a season one episode at the end of March 2012. As we all know, a lot of people watched season one on TV, but even people who liked the show do not understand how it turned out. Robyn's response was very controversial because even though she acknowledged it was her choice to leave, Robyn took a stance against her husband's behaviour and eventually called for him to leave. Robyn is not the first person to call for Robyn's support and her response to this is shocking. In December 2012, Amber Heard called for more action from the network, after Amber released a statement about Robyn's behavior. She said, \"I know Robyn and I care deeply about each of you and it is unfortunate that she has chosen only to leave her husband and child with those who choose to act like idiots and act like their lives are a game. We've said it before and I will say it again. I understand her concerns and I take my responsibility seriously. They're children, they're grownups and this isn't revenge.\" The statement was the end of a long career. Robyn had also released a statement. She said, 'Because of Robyn and her choices on social media and through her actions now, I must say that I am deeply troubled by her behavior and do not want to be in this position again. Robyn has had enough of her behaviour on social media and she will continue to do so to protect her children and keep Robyn from going back to hurting her children and their families. She has also said that she is worried that it could backfire with her husband Robyn and she is planning on changing her plans and will return to work to raise her children and try to stop any more of this from happening in the future.' The network also took strong note of Amber Heard's statement, which she said, 'we have taken notice.

{"id":287,"ended":true,"length":541,"text":"On May 23, 2008, Finkelstein was denied entry to Israel, according to unnamed Shin Bet security officials, because `` of suspicions involving hostile elements in Lebanon `` and that he `` had been involved in the terrorist financing syndicate.''\n\nIn 2002 Finkelstein, the head of the Palestinian Authority, was a target of an intelligence-sharing arm of the Israeli government that used \"warfare methods'' to infiltrate Palestinian intelligence services and the Israeli government, Finkelstein told the Haaretz newspaper.\n\nDuring the next decade Finkelstein was a target of Israeli and Hamas agents, Israel and Hezbollah, and was involved in negotiations for a \"peace process,'' according to one Israeli intelligence source said at the time.\n\nThe sources said that in 2000 Israeli and Iranian forces made a phone call to Finkelstein, telling him to be at the Israeli government's embassy in Tel Aviv.\n\nForkstein remained in Washington for much of 2009 and 2010 and was among the top targets for CIA and IDF intelligence service sources. In that time he was also arrested.\n\nIsrael also investigated his contacts with Hezbollah, Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah officials and Mossad and other Israeli government officials, according to one Israeli security source.\n\nThe Israelis took note\n\nIn early 2011, Netanyahu ordered Finkelstein -- a close confidant of former PM Moshe Ya'alon -- to pay 10 billion shillings ($1.3 billion) to Israeli intelligence services to protect him and his home in Jerusalem after a July 21 shooting attack last year killed five Israelis and nine Palestinians.\n\n'Bitter bitterness'\n\nFinkelstein met the former leader of a Palestinian national group called Fatah in 2005 and in early 2006, when the two were in Lebanon, Finkelstein told the Haaretz newspaper.\n\nThe first time Finkelstein met with the Israeli prime minister was at a meeting in Israel in 2004, according to a source. When the two sides began discussions, Finkelstein had come down for the first time to apologize to Netanyahu, a prime minister that did not recognize his position, the source said.\n\n\"The Israeli prime minister said that he would consider it as a bad act if he was unable to prevent Finkelstein's exit from the Israeli government,\" the source added.\n\nNetanyahu and his government, which was led by Yair Lapid, were to pay Finkelstein at least 6 billion shillings, the source said. In a short time after the meeting, after Netanyahu's victory and a brief break in a previous trip to Lebanon, Finkelstein met with Israeli Interior Minister Avigdor Lieberman for a few days and then returned home.\n\nNetanyahu and his Cabinet members refused to acknowledge that Finkelstein was close to Rafak Arafat, a senior Islamic cleric in the Palestinian territory. Finkelstein was supposed to have visited Israel in June 2010.\n\nNetanyahu later said he had only gotten enough time to visit and then took him off the agenda. But he did not go, and Finkelstein left the country in October.","token_len":629,"entropy":[7.4895,3.3817,0.2586,4.2949,0.2084,10.6534,2.0164,0.2927,2.6918,6.5199,2.055,0.7373,4.4743,2.3821,4.203,0.0012,9.2126,10.0316,0.0014,3.1372,1.079,1.9482,2.634,13.8128,10.8763,5.4461,6.2027,8.3983,4.226,1.3665,4.9599,5.8786,0.6567,2.4899,1.5565,4.2067,2.9336,1.496,2.1812,0.1205,2.1001,3.7891,5.1303,8.9851,0.6792,5.1768,1.8462,0.0011,2.5799,5.2915,3.2481,0.0046,0.0008,2.7508,4.4104,2.1665,0.0075,0.9134,4.402,2.2928,1.22,0.8363,4.6222,4.823,0.1685,2.8517,4.3853,3.1979,1.7253,8.9369,0.2486,0.7353,1.5895,1.6222,2.4575,5.0184,5.9554,6.3366,3.9361,4.1308,1.6977,0.788,3.1277,2.44,4.8178,1.7695,1.4449,4.0801,2.8202,2.2846,1.6045,4.6822,0.0028,0.001,1.8699,1.2176,4.7913,0.0302,0.3206,0.7624,1.1187,0.0003,4.6218,1.0301,5.9166,2.212,1.2673,0.0017,0.0003,1.3007,2.5293,4.4239,0.1019,2.267,3.5228,4.9412,4.3164,1.1406,5.771,3.0734,4.6219,1.1908,1.5924,2.0977,2.5927,0.0348,5.1323,2.5469,1.6977,4.701,1.9468,2.7749,3.2133,2.0772,0.0023,4.3719,2.2186,0.7992,1.2328,6.5665,4.7753,0.0759,0.0022,0.0984,0.5063,0.0002,2.8694,3.9587,0.9378,1.951,3.4549,4.2874,5.0203,2.4498,4.7239,4.5159,5.6258,1.6844,6.0489,0.135,0.3596,0.4626,0.0008,0.0005,1.73,2.7466,0.0503,1.7622,4.8558,6.151,1.1954,3.4286,5.5151,0.5406,3.3061,0.2498,1.9347,0.0019,1.2258,2.3943,0.0002,4.5996,6.7893,3.7714,5.8151,1.1129,5.8831,2.0328,4.6832,0.0118,3.9085,1.6735,1.3838,3.0783,1.4077,5.029,1.1025,2.2089,5.1852,3.1576,6.313,1.6123,6.5945,1.3135,5.2733,5.5418,1.4787,2.9657,4.3404,0.6272,1.3277,1.0559,2.5087,4.4221,4.1407,0.5852,0.0003,3.9779,4.328,4.9272,4.054,2.8271,0.3723,3.2099,1.3496,6.4073,1.6245,3.5543,0.732,2.1882,4.8573,2.2937,7.5101,0.0019,2.8143,2.0331,1.6708,3.5737,1.3226,1.3652,1.1379,0.0143,3.0621,1.8672,3.9058,0.394,0.393,0.385,0.0002,2.7216,3.9696,5.6605,3.0952,5.918,0.0002,2.0938,3.4585,2.5106,0.9342,4.6989,3.504,1.4121,0.0025,0.0004,6.7635,2.354,3.0172,2.5399,0.2779,0.195,2.9471,6.5266,4.6893,0.0001,0.7358,0.4202,0.0014,0.3573,0.4467,6.6375,6.3853,2.7401,3.1584,0.6399,0.0,0.473,2.4686,0.1337,2.3338,0.434,0.1339,0.6777,4.5519,2.2304,2.4571,1.6772,4.7067,1.0244,2.473,0.7376,6.6058,1.182,2.0783,5.8083,3.1523,6.4348,4.7889,5.486,2.685,7.7601,0.5469,6.3191,2.7556,0.9373,1.2496,6.0431,0.8434,0.3323,0.4062,0.0003,7.0741,4.5285,4.3532,7.0792,0.3002,0.1277,0.0001,1.1137,0.0006,0.0007,4.829,3.4439,3.3446,3.6426,0.6812,3.484,2.745,4.5679,2.4801,2.086,3.5818,0.0031,1.4805,3.3574,1.1814,3.7556,5.7578,0.5196,3.0437,2.5928,2.124,2.3639,1.6549,2.198,4.9754,0.5659,2.0358,0.0008,0.0005,1.5369,1.5421,0.7903,0.0002,0.0906,0.6402,0.5595,0.0003,2.5492,5.546,2.676,2.3275,0.0012,0.0007,0.4598,1.5562,2.1245,3.5886,1.2511,0.0103,0.6848,2.5201,0.8269,1.3249,1.4904,4.1128,1.0972,4.0385,1.0191,2.3279,0.0034,1.9256,1.6654,1.9706,4.5548,1.9399,1.3409,6.312,4.1437,3.9971,1.6935,0.5884,0.0003,0.0004,4.2892,6.1812,4.967,4.9159,2.8915,1.4139,0.0233,1.7032,7.833,1.3676,1.9101,1.4897,3.5534,6.5999,0.0461,4.3878,5.2276,0.0317,3.7212,2.2707,4.5598,2.3404,0.7691,0.0654,0.1148,0.0442,0.2533,0.0002,3.903,2.3609,3.5792,0.8026,0.0037,2.897,2.046,1.0984,2.2228,4.7333,2.6376,4.3326,0.9833,4.5157,4.4268,3.0498,1.2158,3.3617,4.9469,0.0308,5.989,1.5536,0.0021,0.0008,3.0056,5.6319,0.9358,1.0125,2.4257,0.4708,0.8544,0.2537,0.0526,2.9568,0.0774,0.3057,0.0002,3.2633,0.0,3.2479,2.5481,2.8501,3.6183,2.2786,3.0696,3.7681,0.0302,4.2661,3.2459,0.0073,0.0,0.2677,3.0634,5.8964,6.2675,1.0921,0.0004,0.0006,4.8257,0.2789,5.876,0.3252,0.0707,0.0817,0.0011,2.0961,1.6652,0.122,0.185,0.2266,4.5622,2.9456,6.0178,1.9114,3.457,1.2895,0.7591,0.344,6.2416,1.867,1.8445,6.2436,3.7693,3.3686,5.7425,4.7111,1.3168,4.1813,5.4303,3.5169,0.542,2.3531,0.234,0.3298,0.0005,0.0008,2.671,0.3765,3.5345,5.9048,0.0497,1.9461,0.0278,0.0,0.2214,4.5155,1.2725,4.3174,1.765,2.1042,2.3768,3.109,3.3018,1.1064,0.2187,0.0002,2.5782,0.0,2.4867,1.3679,4.427,4.2406,5.5338,0.159,3.5755,2.4028,0.5082,0.0008,0.0008,1.5614,5.7868,0.1604,9.8275,8.2448,8.9702,0.0007,0.2546,2.1336,2.916,7.58,2.5986,2.6428,1.0939,1.9998,5.3192,1.4155,2.0241,0.0004,0.0011,1.8293,5.4095,0.0015,2.3474,4.1573,3.6971,1.5954,3.4134,3.0872,1.6247,0.5307,0.0002,2.4498,0.0,3.5116,2.2129,1.9157,1.5819,4.4799,5.5481,8.049,4.0594,0.2495,2.44,4.7866,5.2425,5.2132,3.1835,4.5114,1.3121,4.0473,1.0466,3.826,2.3829,2.1449,0.7708,5.0642,3.6948,1.8347,1.5518,0.0005,0.0005,3.7912,1.7868,1.3912,1.6353,3.3441,2.3969]}
{"id":4637,"ended":true,"length":570,"text":"On September 1, a subtropical storm became Tropical Storm Emily southwest of Bermuda. Emily moved northeast, crossing the island the next day, but measured winds were below tropical storm force.\n\nThe storm passed through the Caribbean islands late on Sunday, leading to flooding and damaged homes. It razed thousands, damaged infrastructure, and toppled roofs. It formed out of the Atlantic Ocean on Friday, causing tropical storm strength to top 5 knots (70 mph) on the NHC's official system. Storms will approach Florida on Saturday, where it will stall briefly.\n\nThe tropical storm is forecast to center on the northwest coasts of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands early Sunday.\n\nEaster Wednesday was the oldest day of the year in U.S. history because the year starts on April 1.\n\nThe storm caused a powerful hurricane in parts of Florida, with a center of strength of 80 mph (140 kph) near the east coast of Florida, and was centered about 2 miles offshore from Fort Lauderdale in North Carolina.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, Easter was the oldest day of the year in U.S. history.\n\nLast year had been the only Easter, which occurred on May 13, 2015, when President Barack Obama visited Cuba and Nicaragua.\n\nThe 2017 season is estimated to be about 9-13 months long, with tropical cyclones generally making their home port.\n\nForecaster James D. Martin said Sunday that \"this year's hurricane season... is probably one of the most extensive on record\".\n\nBut many of the other season's storms have been expected to become tropical storms, and could change their course over a wide swath of the Atlantic.\n\n\"You are looking at a large, potentially catastrophic hurricane\" this season, Martin said.\n\nThere had been concerns at last year's tropical storm storm \"Halo\", which knocked out power to more than 1 million areas in western Virginia.\n\nThe hurricane center is forecasting a slight slowdown from the previous day, which measured winds of 40 mph (85 kph), and forecast storm surges of 10 to 20 feet (6 to 12 meters).\n\nA second \"Halo\" was on track to blow near South Carolina during Saturday's storm, forecasters said.\n\nThe forecast was for the same storm to pass over the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday morning, with the storm moving north to parts of the Carolinas and Florida, and a tropical depression by Sunday morning.\n\nThe storm was supposed to track westward until Wednesday evening, when it was projected to pass over Bermuda, the Atlantic or Atlantic storm centers. The central Atlantic Ocean is expected to receive moderate to heavy rainfall, followed by scattered thunderstorms.\n\n\"They (the storm) will move eastward, then it will move southward,\" NOAA hurricane forecaster Robert F. Miller told a news conference.\n\n\"And then finally they'll leave the storm through the Bahamas.\"\n\nAt least 20 people were killed in Puerto Rico and at least 43 injured, but authorities said Sunday that none were seriously injured in the hurricane.","token_len":629,"entropy":[7.5319,3.3731,0.45,4.1861,11.7758,4.4207,0.0146,0.4951,7.1057,5.73,0.2817,7.4865,9.5769,0.0403,5.6141,1.1456,3.298,3.5257,2.9653,2.8492,6.7329,0.4671,5.4759,6.9746,1.4729,0.1387,1.478,3.6599,8.853,5.465,5.3832,4.437,7.2796,1.1462,2.5,0.8547,1.2559,0.0006,2.0621,1.1552,4.5275,1.4572,1.2778,2.8434,4.0135,6.0965,1.6461,2.2954,1.1938,7.1649,0.5062,3.9951,1.1889,5.5658,1.9104,0.86,2.8054,5.9767,4.7884,5.7813,4.8285,4.8828,3.3241,0.9732,0.4483,6.5279,5.7229,0.6887,3.0402,6.6243,6.8785,0.065,1.0282,2.9211,0.9958,3.148,3.8541,1.0546,2.9296,5.5993,0.4297,5.0823,0.2812,6.5324,3.8117,3.7757,2.862,6.0753,0.3675,1.6067,2.2997,1.2886,5.3769,2.524,1.2757,5.6417,5.979,0.4017,6.0332,1.6108,5.2756,6.4177,3.7118,1.4956,1.4784,1.1971,4.5336,2.5796,0.7708,8.0971,4.9876,1.8854,0.3955,0.0003,1.892,4.5376,0.1294,2.1102,2.7021,0.0923,7.4737,1.3128,1.0181,5.0298,5.981,0.2318,3.8647,0.0024,0.763,1.085,1.8672,0.0028,5.8525,2.2148,1.3538,1.319,0.0002,6.4583,2.1021,6.3504,2.8129,1.5441,7.4957,2.1356,0.713,0.2173,0.2351,1.9839,3.9831,0.0012,0.0017,0.0144,0.2227,7.2577,1.9427,4.0893,3.9378,1.6202,2.8551,2.1033,0.7214,1.3153,0.0002,2.0893,1.8343,5.4752,2.4356,6.6217,3.0003,2.8152,7.406,0.0052,1.6195,1.4302,3.6564,2.8188,5.4499,2.1663,3.1521,0.8897,6.6394,0.4431,1.2645,4.6253,0.5296,0.0765,0.921,4.3902,1.6273,4.6805,0.1684,0.6136,1.5764,1.9109,2.2754,3.6169,3.5431,3.4687,3.2191,0.5919,2.8101,3.0115,4.9198,0.7879,4.0189,4.7697,0.5851,0.3382,0.7874,0.0002,5.1649,0.6688,1.8531,0.9633,0.0667,10.6489,0.7253,1.3343,4.5626,0.2926,0.4985,0.0655,0.0375,0.9226,0.9087,0.0003,0.0015,0.0028,0.0182,1.1335,0.7861,0.0002,5.6058,1.3521,5.9418,2.9633,0.4967,3.93,5.4073,4.181,3.0547,3.8128,1.2016,2.5008,3.7992,0.5682,4.0467,0.6886,1.5357,3.1027,1.0966,0.0016,3.624,3.5539,2.1078,4.7432,0.5665,0.8491,0.0002,1.9147,5.6236,3.1389,1.6672,6.1345,0.0587,0.8665,4.769,4.5105,3.7146,3.5359,2.292,2.5044,0.957,1.4642,5.7229,1.5457,0.1315,6.5207,3.9336,2.5353,5.033,8.6196,3.564,0.8454,0.0003,4.114,3.857,4.6021,4.2474,0.9417,6.071,2.0528,3.1306,0.8431,3.871,3.1464,1.4849,0.9264,2.8653,0.442,8.0649,2.3242,3.9031,3.5218,0.1324,0.0613,1.1204,5.8002,3.2214,0.0271,5.4482,0.4924,0.0003,5.7816,5.0465,2.59,0.2659,5.1835,5.864,0.6279,2.5912,2.309,1.2386,5.0898,0.3859,4.1688,3.5447,1.4479,1.3914,2.5122,4.1535,5.0226,2.3678,1.7138,3.2357,4.8054,3.892,1.5782,0.028,0.2522,1.9787,1.4357,0.5055,0.0003,2.1781,4.3042,4.0915,3.0933,0.1671,1.4089,4.9293,2.5319,5.0186,2.6885,2.3779,7.2106,3.6414,2.6276,0.2529,0.4071,0.1224,0.494,0.907,0.0003,5.2569,4.2068,0.0674,5.4425,4.7863,5.2611,0.576,0.0042,5.608,0.8465,5.7896,5.5423,5.0793,4.1326,2.2092,0.8248,5.3512,0.3659,0.3087,0.7437,2.144,0.0033,1.9683,1.1869,5.6837,1.6432,5.6597,4.2091,1.265,0.6744,0.0003,2.0826,3.1547,5.4329,2.2121,6.7797,1.2418,6.0952,6.1946,4.402,1.5315,2.8992,4.3584,1.0675,2.723,6.2898,2.9175,1.1607,3.5153,0.413,0.1209,4.6214,0.029,0.0001,1.4253,2.4177,6.4427,4.8287,1.9791,0.7058,3.2138,1.6528,0.8929,0.1157,0.4022,2.5395,0.3117,2.3114,0.7849,0.4971,0.4464,0.0003,3.7649,4.186,4.8454,3.087,0.0524,0.2395,2.2566,4.8779,1.6648,0.858,5.6792,6.3231,6.0548,0.3922,5.5269,3.9509,0.7345,1.8053,2.1175,6.4182,0.0264,0.1491,0.1539,0.4547,0.0003,1.8653,4.8504,2.8238,1.9873,2.8311,4.7063,2.2615,0.9929,3.8636,2.5119,1.3557,3.2615,0.6134,0.0069,1.4833,0.676,3.5101,0.75,1.98,2.714,2.8455,3.0413,2.5524,2.9593,6.8291,0.0044,1.355,4.5869,0.0002,1.5567,2.85,1.8747,2.1601,4.1526,3.58,3.6818,6.379,1.3202,2.3537,0.4211,0.4711,0.0003,1.8654,2.0394,1.9002,6.4516,0.002,6.1785,3.4239,1.8502,5.2641,4.8942,2.9263,0.4653,1.3426,0.3633,2.3011,5.5782,0.0328,2.4744,1.4875,6.1056,1.2955,2.4373,3.6935,6.2743,4.4138,5.7097,5.9764,0.9638,3.7981,5.432,2.8044,5.1426,2.181,0.7867,0.0186,5.5628,5.6605,2.4088,1.2742,1.3275,1.6162,4.77,0.0375,6.2312,2.5829,0.0354,1.3654,0.3843,0.0003,3.2891,5.0655,4.5265,1.8204,1.9048,2.4706,1.4145,2.5895,3.0871,1.148,2.0966,2.9954,3.3797,0.2802,1.2094,2.1133,1.2797,1.4393,5.908,2.8291,1.8632,0.0475,4.419,4.1345,0.4327,5.5974,1.9843,3.258,1.2713,0.1743,0.9047,0.4697,0.0003,1.7026,3.5923,1.3146,6.6442,2.4101,1.5042,5.4843,1.4158,3.4367,7.2349,0.4908,4.3353,2.899,0.3556,0.0002,5.4675,1.1972,3.8205,1.4806,0.7308,0.4258,1.0908,4.131,0.0047,1.8605,4.902,0.0006,5.1224,2.5276,1.5309,5.0331,2.3819,1.2214,3.0489,1.0617,3.8779,1.6144,1.0148,0.4816,2.7245,0.2879,2.8238,1.2851]}
{"id":4118,"ended":true,"length":579,"text":"Quong Tart told Channel 5 that he liked the way Miles looks at the world and revealed that he shared similarities with the character's personality. Miles is often shown consuming large amounts of alcohol and eating junk food, but Quong says he likes a glass of water and being able to drink water.\nQuong is a character that was introduced in the fifth season of Doctor Who as a \"quo tarde\" character. Although Quong is a character that is not often seen in the show, Quong is described in the series as very \"quirky\", and quoo is a word and a spirit that was coined by Doctor Who creator Peter Quong as a \"quoo\".\nDoctor Who had originally meant Quong as a personality, but has changed his name in the previous series to Quong Tart. Quong has previously been described as \"a good old' quoo\" in the series. Quong has appeared in every series of the show and was first introduced in the fifth series with Quong Tart as an 'anti-hero'.\nDoctor Who has also introduced Quong as an alcoholic that sometimes drinks with other people. Quong, or Quoy, is a character that is often shown drinking tea and having a drink, but he also has drinking problems and has a drug addiction.\nHuge fan-favorite Chris Harrison is said to be aware of Quong's issues and is currently working on a fan-made episode to bring him to life. To this date, he said:\n\"Miles Quong is just something I always wanted to see in Doctor Who - but I needed to see that character that could change the world. Miles Quoy was the first villain [in Doctor Who]. He was so powerful, so strong and so evil.\"\nDoctor Who was originally written in 1966 for the first time and made many changes to it to appeal to the broad audience. Most notably in the first season, Quong was meant to be 'Superhero'. However, after the series' first episode, which is now still fresh in the culture, fans did not expect that. He was meant to be 'the Superhero'.\nDoctor Who initially had not yet aired as a three volume series, with the first season ending on 14 April 1996. However, new Doctor Who fan-favorite Chris Harrison has given it time as he has mentioned that Miles is currently working on a fan-made episode to bring Quong back to life, because he was a villain. In a short period of time, he has had a much bigger part involved in Doctor Who than in any other fictional character.\nDoctor Who has been on a hiatus since its debut in 1997 and Doctor Who has often been the first series to move away from TV.

I\u2019m working with Anuj Aravind. My role as Mahesh was completely different from the others. When we met, a few months before the shoot, I had my first interaction with Kris and the way he approached me seemed to be a little bit more interesting than what had happened earlier. The film was very interesting, but to be honest, it was all a bit of a mix of shock and awe.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Mahesh Khan on working for Karisma Kapoor: 'Korena ka ek hai'\n\nAlso read: Mahesh Khan talks up Bhumi Pednekar's upcoming film Kalani on Instagram\n\nMahesh also talked about joining the team of Karisma Kapoor for the film and also commented that it would be his last film before she is seen on screen.

{"id":4158,"ended":false,"length":517,"text":"Immediately after the Fiesta Bowl bypassed Virginia Tech in favor of lower @ - @ ranked Notre Dame, protests from Tech fans and opponents of the BCS system erupted. Some said the selection committee took a bad decision, some said it was a \u201cbiggest embarrassment\u201d, and others said the process should end immediately. Here are a few more thoughts\u2026 #FreeTech #FreeBamaNation #FreeWichita & TexasA&M #FreeUWpic.twitter.com\/F6qPcDUq2k \u2014 John W. Mancuso (@MancusoWichita) February 25, 2018\n\nSome said the vote to remove Tech allowed Georgia Tech to win the conference tournament but the Yellow Jackets had to defeat Penn and Michigan to be crowned Big Ten champions. This will have an immediate ripple effect on other teams and colleges as a whole.\n\nWhat does a \u201cBig Ten title\u201d mean?\n\nThe Big Ten is the national conference that is in charge of the Big Ten, which has the No. 1 seed. The conference tournament is known as the Fiesta Bowl because the conference gets its own championship each year.\n\nThe game between Indiana and Illinois in the Big Ten championship game, took place in Pasadena, California.\n\nThis season the Big Ten title went to Virginia Tech as well.\n\nIt was an awesome day for Michigan. If it didn\u2019t look like a fun day to watch, they could have lost to Penn State and Kentucky. Then I watched this game online for only the second time in 6 years. #FreeWichita pic.twitter.com\/3jk0sZsLdEf \u2014 Kevin McCausland (@cfausland) February 25, 2018\n\nHow much more can we have on these games?\n\nThe Big Ten has some of the craziest games on television. If you\u2019re getting really excited about a conference, you may be in the minority of people who can see the excitement around it now. Not so excited about how they\u2019re pulling off this championship tournament. I\u2019ve been a football fan in the past. I\u2019m actually a huge fan of the Big Ten. No one ever said it was bad. However, the SEC is in an insane slump and the last four Big Ten games have been pretty poor either.\n\nIf you can\u2019t believe this is a Big Ten game and not an NCAA title game game or Big 12 victory, chances are much better this year.

{"id":3823,"ended":true,"length":611,"text":"In 2013, former ABC Network President Steven McPherson and Rich Frank, the former chairman of Disney Channel became investors and board members as the company worked to develop new content and improve advertising revenues. Frank, who is currently president of marketing, production, distribution, and partnerships, sold the company to Fox, a subsidiary of Disney. Frank was also on-hand, and was present as well.\n\nOn May 1, 2014, a report named the most expensive sports network ever produced. According to the article, it was owned by the New York Post [the owner of the largest newspaper in the US and the UK] and published on March 20, 2014, only two years old.\n\nAccording to the article, ABC aired the network network as the most expensive and most expensive sports network in its history. This comparison may be difficult to make in other words, but it is indisputable. Most sports networks are expensive and most sports networks have a more than $80 billion turnover. If you do not understand how money makes money, you will be surprised at what you can find in any sports network.\n\nTo put it in another way, according to the article, the first place you have to pay attention to is the amount of money it makes. To put it another way, how much money you spend is a very important measure for advertising revenue as well as the amount of money you get out of it. If it is a small market at all, you can find more money being spent on advertising than when you are doing it.\n\nThe Internet is also an important space for most sports networks. Because many online sports networks are affiliated and therefore the networks get into a larger market by being more relevant [which makes sense]. Because advertisers and the sports networks can talk to each other more directly, this allows them to find ways of getting in depth with many potential fans.\n\nWhen the networks are all working on what will become the world's most important network, they will be able to offer customers of all types of sports the best experience. Whether you are a parent or a customer, everyone will know the value of your brand and its unique appeal. This will make sports the next generation of sports as they have the ability to engage with anyone.\n\nMost of the networks are based on content which would make it easier for advertisers to find the most interesting things on the Internet. A lot of these networks already pay attention to all types of sports, and a lot of them pay attention to the amount of advertising they make and pay attention to any hidden hidden hidden salespeople in a given network.

{"id":665,"ended":false,"length":530,"text":"The first church was markedly cruciform in shape and smaller than the present floor plan. This early structure had a choir without aisles and more truncated, and a nave with only a single choir head, on the top of itself. Although it was a much smaller church, the choir was still large and it housed its main building of the pulpit on its upper third.\n\nA church built by the bishop (later archbishop) of Rome, the church was built not only on the upper third of the floor plan, but was also the very base of the floorplan. This was the Church of the Holy Ghost, built on the first floor of the sanctuary, but also on the second floor of the cloister. The first floor consisted of the main church on the top of its building as well as the cloister. The cloister was dedicated as the \"Sister of the Blessed Virgin\" to the Blessed Martyrs of the New Testament on October 13th, and was consecrated on January 25th, 1692. The cloister served its place as a church until the beginning of the 19th century, when it was replaced in a new structure called the Church of Saints Peter of Arnam. Then, it was replaced in a new structure called the Church of Saints L\u00f3pez (also known as the Church of St. Andrew) in 1722.\n\nIt was an architect's home until 1794 when it was taken over by the same architect that designed the chapel on the top floor of the sanctuary of the abbey church. He designed the building under the direction of Giuseppe Giuseppe Morano. According to Bonifacio (1812-1793), the first architect whose construction was in the midst of the modernization of the abbey was Giuseppe Giuseppe Domenico, who first designed the church of St. Alphonsus, and later on all other parts including the Chapel of the Virgin Mary. After the outbreak of World War I, the church of St. Alphonsus was rebuilt by Giuseppe Giuseppe Domenico.\n\nSt. Alphonsus once featured in the film \"Coffee with the Queen\", as well as the original parish at the entrance.\n\nCulture\n\nAncestry\nThe church contains the same architecture and interior and exterior as the abbey church. Although its interior is similar to that of the cathedral church at Vincenzo, the entire interior and exterior decorations are different from that of the abbey of Vincenzo, and thus in a way, can be seen as \"the church\" of the abbey. With its large roof line and walls, there is an excellent feeling of openness and spaciousness in the overall appearance. The cathedral church provides an ideal spot for many groups of persons coming to visit the cathedral by bus and the public bus.\n\nExternal links\n\nArchives\nArchives\nArchives of Holy Cross\nArchives of the Holy Cross\nArchives of the Lord Apostolic\nArchives of the Lord Apostolic\nArchives of the Holy Cross","token_len":632,"entropy":[5.3423,9.1719,2.6372,11.9355,14.0635,5.1638,1.8608,2.1442,1.783,8.1578,1.1666,0.6486,5.9891,10.358,2.8018,0.8918,3.1953,6.2583,5.3696,3.0989,1.7875,7.3071,7.9684,1.1645,11.9756,0.0022,1.3047,6.4041,10.6669,0.0871,3.5247,2.7614,2.8922,7.3451,1.0188,1.947,3.8048,1.2502,2.4365,2.7419,6.1946,2.3087,4.3936,1.2119,3.4173,0.9625,9.7098,0.4503,5.6453,2.2359,0.9726,2.8392,4.9512,1.8272,1.2823,0.881,1.6357,3.8797,1.3256,2.6023,3.3256,1.5246,4.5205,5.2295,5.2004,5.1369,3.3331,4.4609,2.1001,7.6007,0.0007,3.977,3.094,2.5807,4.2396,0.9576,2.0394,0.0605,3.5966,3.3052,3.0842,2.4093,1.2615,5.4237,4.5844,4.7084,7.6002,0.0432,0.7647,1.4191,3.0396,1.853,2.4678,3.2331,1.4368,2.1468,5.8652,2.1314,1.5334,0.6334,3.8616,0.7303,0.6835,0.2176,3.0658,0.5711,0.7321,0.0615,4.0649,0.8127,3.5839,5.4541,4.9999,0.29,0.4659,5.6548,3.7996,0.9755,2.2555,1.6254,1.5931,4.6491,0.3141,1.3297,2.414,2.8173,1.1952,2.527,1.8543,0.5093,3.691,0.634,0.7313,0.2899,5.3849,1.6003,3.71,1.7565,1.0394,0.1912,1.8135,0.5513,1.3209,0.0749,8.1444,0.0662,0.6942,1.238,3.0553,1.3026,3.4292,0.1367,2.0082,3.8598,1.9313,3.8693,0.3472,2.2268,0.677,2.9916,4.6654,4.8497,0.336,0.0148,0.6555,3.1397,0.0427,1.6319,1.0264,2.3533,0.0173,0.644,5.6832,3.8635,0.9699,3.8408,5.6249,2.3302,1.4076,0.556,3.9666,1.1048,1.9728,3.2387,0.792,2.498,7.9868,0.8794,1.1188,1.1177,5.4268,1.0958,5.0094,3.233,3.1732,3.6122,0.3747,4.336,1.5761,3.9967,0.0017,1.6241,3.6195,3.5974,0.0567,0.6426,2.8999,4.2738,0.3821,1.2507,2.4223,0.0104,5.313,4.9237,6.3435,0.6786,1.7397,3.9181,5.7673,0.9392,4.3772,0.0118,0.1024,2.8257,0.0084,0.0212,0.9928,0.285,0.8059,0.2263,3.7256,3.3348,3.2999,2.1761,2.5152,3.3811,0.3819,2.37,0.1119,5.6603,3.6541,4.6841,3.6745,12.0043,2.0236,6.6321,1.0216,3.8938,0.2806,2.9305,1.6311,1.6823,0.8356,0.6699,0.1713,0.0978,0.4714,0.0429,2.4474,6.5476,5.8934,0.023,3.3083,3.5231,0.9089,0.0469,0.6237,1.2085,0.0806,2.3949,0.3272,4.9547,1.8263,1.4011,2.4456,4.4721,0.4744,1.1779,0.0002,3.9653,1.013,4.5427,6.6506,1.7427,6.9609,3.881,3.6116,3.8031,1.105,1.0957,0.1394,4.1123,0.1787,0.104,0.7008,5.7937,1.0893,4.5332,2.4587,0.2844,4.5099,2.6247,0.6102,2.4431,2.4123,0.5329,0.3047,1.8208,3.4627,1.0659,6.4059,0.1016,5.9001,1.047,4.9813,3.3468,0.8667,3.3497,5.0675,0.4088,1.7394,0.0207,6.1691,0.4059,0.0027,4.6197,2.1994,0.0353,4.9511,3.5931,1.6892,5.2021,0.001,8.1708,2.3952,1.1374,4.8728,2.0185,4.6325,1.0671,3.224,3.6639,0.2112,1.469,3.0035,5.7202,6.6286,6.2107,2.0764,3.948,1.2187,5.2903,0.0039,0.8365,7.2103,0.1675,0.4214,3.4735,0.0072,2.2132,1.2706,0.0165,0.0014,3.0908,0.1927,0.0096,5.2943,3.5518,0.249,3.0447,0.8932,5.4099,1.9505,0.2446,2.1952,3.2211,0.5398,0.1033,4.8103,0.0476,0.1317,2.5919,2.1219,1.5056,2.8413,7.0815,3.4082,5.1994,9.2467,0.1539,5.2436,0.283,1.3997,2.1887,0.583,0.6153,4.7226,1.4535,8.1393,0.0026,1.9954,0.006,0.2906,0.3594,1.2048,1.0843,1.7785,0.2985,0.0022,0.3688,0.0023,0.0041,0.3119,2.5153,2.5262,1.9422,0.0101,0.0035,1.945,0.01,0.0096,2.0486,0.0017,0.0101,1.7204,1.1272,0.0002,5.0075,0.1117,0.2619,0.002,0.008,7.3844,5.3424,2.6395,0.8197,5.8187,1.6177,4.5371,6.1968,0.5441,2.5066,1.1388,4.6978,2.7341,3.18,1.2304,0.0063,1.8189,4.4741,6.5439,5.7061,1.1439,4.9064,3.1188,1.5673,0.0001,4.9297,4.6431,0.8735,0.0002,5.5412,5.0597,0.8971,0.3199,17.5014,1.8817,6.3104,2.3625,3.3616,5.0142,1.9573,6.7781,5.1015,0.7649,3.113,0.5739,2.685,0.0032,1.2463,1.0001,4.6799,4.1461,2.9333,1.1599,4.1023,0.4236,0.6802,0.0304,0.2647,3.3445,1.8568,5.4195,7.0876,1.9982,1.6762,0.0026,1.1515,1.1259,6.0439,1.9009,3.3101,0.6413,7.3312,0.6556,2.6695,2.369,1.0856,0.1017,0.1658,1.4671,0.0019,5.8861,2.3633,0.013,0.0019,0.001,2.4297,2.0313,4.6019,5.7182,3.0296,1.3052,2.6208,5.4593,0.4922,3.0138,0.7654,4.0868,3.1957,2.7734,3.2949,1.4815,0.5427,1.4065,0.0043,0.6389,6.3777,2.0512,3.0565,5.6279,5.4321,1.3157,5.8375,0.7929,4.0907,0.4692,2.6377,3.8667,4.9769,0.2448,3.5821,1.0745,4.6444,0.0234,1.9178,0.2807,6.5663,3.449,1.5108,1.1811,4.4047,1.2003,7.029,2.083,1.8155,3.765,0.3856,4.9798,4.9954,0.7427,3.9694,6.4634,0.972,2.1274,1.1972,2.7675,6.204,3.1886,2.5642,4.065,3.548,2.0082,1.5663,1.1334,0.0001,8.169,5.5956,0.7416,0.0003,2.3932,4.3127,1.162,23.2315,0.6336,3.2017,23.3103,0.5144,2.5954,6.6797,2.9785,1.8853,22.0859,0.3426,0.0352,2.2946,2.4908,0.55,0.7173,22.0174,0.1188,0.0265,0.5758,8.035,9.4224,0.0453,3.8915,2.7935,0.08,0.0251,0.3413,2.872,1.2174,0.0013,1.1469,4.4212,0.0436,0.0164,0.2969,1.7421,0.3152]}
{"id":146,"ended":true,"length":548,"text":"In October 2001, Stansfield's performances for Elmore impressed Yeovil Town manager Gary Johnson to sign him. He made his debut in the Conference on 9 November, playing the entirety of a three-minute match in a 1-1 draw at Reading, winning three points and being recalled to the starting line-up against Reading.\n\nIt was on 5 December 2001 that Yeovil manager Gary Johnson revealed that Stansfield had signed winger Jaron Brown on a free transfer from Sheffield Wednesday to Cardiff City. It was on 8 April, the week before the new Championship year starts, that Johnson announced that Jeron Brown had been re-signed by Cardiff City and that Stansfield had agreed to keep him by the club until December 2000.\n\nBrown has won five Championship titles in his 11 years at Stansfield, winning five of them in his six games with the Welsh club. He has scored 10 goals during his time at Stansfield and provided six assists in all competitions. He is also the only player in North Rhine-Westphalia who has scored more goals against a full team than Brown has given up in a single campaign.\n\nBrown has had some form of injury trouble during and after the season, where he suffered a hamstring injury in February and missed one match against Bradford City on 25 February. His injury injury has been described widely as ''one of the most serious injuries that we have seen in a footballer's career'' at Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nBrown's first step towards signing him was on 3 July, when Brown's parent club, Sheffield Wednesday, confirmed that he had become available to them on a free transfer and that the 25-year-old had signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with the club. In the following weeks, Brown made more than 100 appearances in all competitions for Sheffield Wednesday, scoring 10 goals.\n\nBrown left Sheffield Wednesday on a free transfer from Sheffield Wednesday on 3 January, and was released by the Premier League club on 17 February, although his performance at Reading in April, when he scored the only goals in a game, saw his contract cancelled.\n\nStansfield have said that in the next few weeks they will offer Brown a new contract at the end of his contract, but they have not yet spoken to him.\n\nBrown is due to leave his existing contract at Reading on 19 July when Stansfield will be finished with their season at the start of the new season. He has not played since January 31 and is now nursing an ankle injury.\n\nBrown is expected in a loan deal to Cardiff on the off-season.\n\nBrown is likely to earn \u00a340,000-a-week from Cardiff City this season.

{"id":4082,"ended":false,"length":542,"text":"The remnants of Blanca, aided by an unusually late @ - @ season coastal low, later brought several days of scattered thunderstorms to the Southwestern United States. Effects in California were primarily in the upper 50\u00eds, but the southwesterly winds were stronger than normal, lasting for a mile or two, while southern winds picked up above 60 miles-per-hour.\n\nFriday's gusty winds did little to dampen the northwesterly winds. The wind-blown coastal high winds made much of the south-south Atlantic very gusty.\n\nThe winds also resulted in winds and peltings, including breaking one of the strongest high seas in the Atlantic!\n\nOur forecast is to pick up above the mid 30\u00eds where temps and currents are relatively low as we head into the weekend.\n\nFriday night looks to be a nice day to enjoy an early-morning beach walk during the afternoon.\n\nSaturday will be a decent and mostly sunny day with the wind picking up in the low 50\u00eds where gusty winds were stronger than usual in the mid 60\u00eds.\n\nSaturday should be a nice day for walks and a dip in temperatures.\n\nMonday will be a mild cool weather day and it will be windy as well.\n\nTuesday will be dry and sunny, allowing for a dry and sunny afternoon.\n\nWednesday will be partly clear and sunny.\n\nThursday will be warm and slightly warmer with a touch more breezy and rainy than usual.\n\nFriday night will be quiet, but also warm. Temperatures will turn warmer with a bit more sun on the horizon and winds picking up in between a few miles a lap or more.\n\nFriday night will start to warm up a bit and the temperatures will drop off a little bit but still warm and warm. Temperatures will turn warmer with some sun on the horizon.\n\nFriday night will also see a bit of heat.

PlayStation VR is available in various third platform including Android Phone, and PlayStation VR is available in various third platform including iOS.\n\nFor more information on Nenokkadine, see here;\n\nThe Japanese developer is also developing iOS-only Nenokkadine mobile app, which will initially be available for iOS devices, although this product will not be available on mobile devices.\n\nNenokkadine has already reached its target market for mobile apps, which are typically more cost effective to build and include features like the ability to use the N-key (as opposed to the iPhone or iPad). In the beginning Nenokkadine, was made available for PC platforms on August 2010, and later on iOS and Android later on. The first Nenokkadine mobile game was launched on April 2011. Its launch has attracted quite a lot of attention from customers of the mobile video game industry, which is now actively contributing to mobile gaming worldwide.\n\nThe Japanese site, Nenokkadine.com, said that in the next few months, as developers begin to migrate to mobile video apps, Nenokkadine mobile apps will be integrated into the company's offerings and offer features to help developers find the perfect mobile game. One of the ways to create an Nenokkadine mobile game that will meet current mobile gaming standards is to create an iOS or Android application for any specific mobile game using Nenokkan App. The first iOS game to receive Nenokkadine functionality is for the upcoming mobile game, Nenokkadine, and that's when the concept of mobile games will be born...\n\nThe mobile game Nenokkadine, which launched on the Android App in late April 2011 as an Android Games Store exclusive, will release this March 2012 on an iPad. Other upcoming games for the mobile game Nenokkadine, which has been an Android Games Store exclusive, will also be released.","token_len":634,"entropy":[9.5803,2.4837,4.4691,2.7981,2.1377,6.2681,2.9506,2.6309,4.5053,3.2068,0.0274,2.15,1.8766,5.4968,2.1675,2.6545,12.3515,6.8749,9.4201,6.2802,6.6453,5.343,4.764,6.2529,6.811,4.1051,3.7424,7.7646,5.0768,12.3786,0.9975,4.9107,9.5187,0.0041,1.1002,3.0241,2.4452,0.8345,1.8431,1.1396,3.6019,1.4063,3.2685,3.7519,2.5823,2.8938,2.7322,6.0042,0.5237,1.6009,0.0814,2.5601,4.2448,6.0439,4.9389,7.5664,3.4578,2.5893,1.9987,2.0699,4.7318,0.0326,2.3454,4.9781,2.6666,0.3224,1.4109,5.2342,1.2169,3.0801,0.1828,0.0092,1.4689,2.0662,4.9914,2.4187,3.916,6.7265,4.1056,7.8362,1.2496,0.9966,1.4786,2.9026,4.8015,0.5545,3.6264,5.28,1.5289,6.4171,0.6293,2.1359,3.7047,3.1839,0.3443,0.3758,0.3686,0.2886,1.987,5.3246,6.1389,5.6511,1.1907,1.7144,2.2917,2.5884,4.2203,1.096,2.6636,1.9295,8.2757,3.1012,0.829,0.144,0.7816,0.5547,0.4044,1.6745,0.5029,5.4717,1.3537,1.6572,0.7105,2.0939,1.3099,2.1276,0.0131,1.0665,0.7662,0.5967,0.0002,2.5193,0.0448,0.0074,0.0021,0.0025,0.0007,4.2254,2.2408,1.1439,2.6226,1.3807,2.1379,1.7885,4.1786,1.1679,1.9273,1.5161,0.0262,3.8502,2.4481,4.0995,0.1839,4.0309,4.1171,0.3002,3.8839,4.6163,1.34,0.9164,0.0002,2.3761,2.6209,2.5141,1.2651,2.5032,3.3843,1.9688,4.4175,2.0913,1.8641,2.1641,1.3561,1.5048,5.1206,3.6072,0.2972,0.0187,0.0096,0.0208,0.0035,3.0698,2.9643,5.6463,2.5294,5.3496,0.9109,2.8867,0.0116,0.0045,0.0036,0.0008,0.0012,2.5925,1.1443,5.2308,1.5944,4.9364,4.1136,0.6417,0.5864,1.1064,0.1477,1.3346,3.0833,2.5587,1.8365,2.6962,4.4923,1.9938,2.5006,0.8609,0.2741,2.7045,0.0005,0.0106,0.1502,3.8528,4.4619,0.0114,0.9586,4.5418,1.2309,0.5472,4.9743,0.0447,1.07,2.4614,2.0308,5.0649,6.2688,10.9301,7.4453,3.0124,7.6021,0.5847,4.308,2.6018,0.2946,1.1633,0.6955,1.1197,3.0203,2.2473,2.0082,2.4959,1.2195,1.5993,0.5795,0.0002,4.0248,0.4442,0.2751,1.1639,0.8403,0.0047,0.0047,0.0029,0.001,0.0017,0.675,3.4467,4.4428,5.4431,3.7908,0.0002,3.7249,3.5438,1.1105,2.5103,1.6814,3.1751,5.9661,2.4299,1.2898,4.8265,0.0533,0.0073,0.008,0.0042,0.0053,3.3153,2.4908,1.8239,1.2738,0.9624,6.6199,0.844,0.6183,1.306,1.7811,3.153,2.8961,5.4355,3.5607,4.4426,1.1939,1.5543,0.4775,0.8927,1.6088,3.7355,1.0052,0.7487,0.8142,0.0002,1.5977,0.0312,0.0057,0.004,0.001,0.0014,2.3662,3.2948,4.615,2.2634,3.4037,3.6309,3.2001,1.7254,2.9033,1.5552,2.1111,2.3676,5.0391,4.6716,4.2766,0.6872,3.6773,3.7757,1.4992,6.5431,4.1985,3.8585,2.6568,2.0452,0.0307,3.603,1.6234,3.5035,2.7327,3.4,4.1644,5.112,0.8191,0.0009,1.2285,6.7929,1.6641,0.9187,2.2396,3.0599,1.8895,5.0186,3.0615,0.0187,0.016,0.0038,0.0006,0.0027,4.4685,4.6927,4.8321,1.5971,1.3411,4.9723,4.5986,3.716,4.1302,5.9324,1.0253,0.9998,3.2198,1.7932,1.8632,1.6433,0.2103,5.2788,1.4559,1.2179,2.1484,3.535,1.5036,0.032,0.0057,0.0037,0.0012,0.0034,1.9512,1.982,0.9113,3.1229,1.1504,3.3063,2.5412,1.3393,6.152,3.0742,2.9681,5.4637,4.8255,0.034,1.4521,0.0212,0.9137,1.8334,5.9744,3.9664,1.6264,2.2935,5.5639,0.4363,0.9386,0.9815,2.8643,1.8855,2.9078,4.9962,6.4337,0.5487,5.1926,2.3165,4.6798,0.2234,0.6246,0.0002,2.4005,3.2345,6.7514,3.7618,1.4261,0.0757,0.0143,0.0101,0.0082,0.0062,0.7784,0.8111,0.4359,5.859,1.1493,3.9809,1.7861,2.6939,1.1781,0.507,1.2297,5.9855,5.1089,3.23,0.4594,5.5866,0.7033,1.2051,4.5053,6.5365,0.3263,1.206,0.0067,0.0081,0.0046,0.0004,0.0018,5.6691,2.8017,0.2014,0.9463,4.8282,1.2161,0.9586,4.587,0.0163,6.5479,2.6295,5.693,4.4346,3.1788,3.108,2.1825,4.3226,2.1625,3.6103,1.1109,1.2308,1.2359,6.0323,0.7202,0.3166,5.4968,2.4475,5.1179,1.922,2.051,0.1121,0.0137,0.0027,0.0009,0.0016,0.6024,0.706,3.8884,2.2301,4.9196,5.3391,2.2765,2.0434,2.8694,0.2933,0.874,2.4742,1.6399,3.2291,2.3894,0.0772,2.9719,2.9615,6.1778,5.7604,1.5821,1.4535,5.1583,1.7109,0.0317,0.0073,9.4955,6.4248,1.6991,2.2736,4.1969,2.8605,3.1232,2.5907,3.3598,1.781,0.0129,0.0117,0.911,0.0233,0.0037,6.495,1.3774,5.7889,1.4195,4.5552,3.2078,0.9249,2.5873,2.4077,0.2712,0.065,0.787,0.137,0.0317,3.2051,3.0755,4.2773,3.8357,3.9533,1.4383,6.1297,0.5674,2.3207,1.1989,0.7239,1.1133,4.5218,6.2342,0.7309,0.0003,2.4951,2.8743,1.2684,2.8003,0.0102,0.0073,0.4664,0.0055,0.0019,2.6246,1.6379,2.808,1.0242,2.6571,2.5126,0.9851,2.3449,2.1259,3.2767,1.3331,4.7888,2.0445,1.9138,7.8277,3.3173,1.6647,0.4509,1.7546,4.7288,5.0461,4.8352,2.4485,1.9211,6.0557,3.7738,2.2355,5.872,4.5398,3.3558,1.7921,0.815,1.5587,2.5624,1.2722,0.0026,0.0049,0.0278,0.001,0.0017,3.3471,2.267,3.1319,1.1803,6.2239,1.6124,1.9128,0.0286,0.0177,1.0504,1.5598,1.9849,0.3854,1.1708,2.7564]}
{"id":1453,"ended":false,"length":544,"text":"Cooksey had started his career as a trainee with Colchester United, prior to moving onto a number of non @ - @ League clubs. His first move was to Heybridge Swifts before joining the Northampton town in the summer of 2018.\n\nThe 28 year old has found his feet at Colchester, having started his League career as a trainee with Colchester. He is an experienced performer and scored four times in 23 appearances, with 12 of those matches finishing with a goal. His last appearance for Colchester was in Saturday's loss to St Johnstone.\n\nCooksey has featured for the Northampton Town squad once since breaking into the first team in 2017 as a 22-year-old. To date he has scored five goals in 13 appearances in all competitions.\n\nThe England international has been capped four times for the Pro Kirers, and three times for the U-24s. He is also a member of the first team, and is currently on loan at Aston Villa and Lincoln City in the North West.\n\nCooksey has been working closely with the U-20s and hopes that he can give something back to SouthAMP, or possibly even his home country, South and West.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the support we\u2019ve got. SouthAMP, Aston Villa and Lincoln as well as playing under (Trent) Cooksey, I would definitely call it a good association. Southamp is wonderful and I think this is one of the best clubs in the country,\u201d Cooksey told the club\u2019s official website. \u201cI had to go to school for the U-12s, and the U-14s as well. I hope that I can come back and play for them in the U-19s.\u201d\n\nCooksey also made two appearances with U-13's during the 2018\/19 European Under-21 season, and has also helped the U-17s. He also featured for Southampton for the first time in April, when he was on loan at the League Two club. He has earned a number of accolades for Northampton, in the same span which led Cooksey to earn a club record 16 starts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the quality of football that\u2019s been built here at SouthAMP, and I think it\u2019s one of the top levels in the country and a good club. I hope that it doesn\u2019t get too much of a media attention or attention from international news outlets, but football will always continue to remain a place where the game is alive and well for fans to enjoy and remember. In the long run it\u2019s a great club with the kind of fans that we\u2019ve got and the work it can do in building a future that\u2019s bright and happy,\u201d said Cooksey.\n\n\u201cI wish the best for the club\u2019s future and want to support it and all those people in the area who want to build a future where the game is alive and well.\u201d","token_len":636,"entropy":[10.0459,4.9268,5.6158,2.6788,1.0513,1.4121,0.3,6.6886,0.0657,4.0765,8.4814,1.7319,3.0949,1.4688,6.7585,0.0273,2.2594,4.9036,3.367,4.963,0.0128,7.3336,15.6011,10.3582,7.0889,7.5774,5.7326,1.1111,3.6671,1.6133,3.6364,1.3423,0.8689,10.1421,6.8879,7.2598,4.2308,5.6954,2.1215,2.869,4.8479,1.1662,6.9974,2.2773,2.4673,0.5223,0.1451,6.1232,0.3729,1.0485,0.0035,3.1204,4.3576,1.8853,0.1833,2.1555,6.3146,1.822,2.9324,0.8724,2.4887,0.0009,2.2322,2.4956,3.0959,1.9155,6.992,0.4355,2.7986,0.1483,0.8949,0.0006,0.4112,0.3618,0.0005,4.4988,1.6279,2.9747,4.2776,1.7911,4.6988,1.3912,4.6662,3.497,3.8388,1.345,5.1725,1.098,3.4705,3.0989,4.5859,3.3893,0.2342,4.1871,5.7433,1.8228,0.791,0.5894,0.5266,3.6982,3.8955,1.7479,2.3345,1.142,0.0011,1.1049,1.1493,6.6498,0.17,5.8016,0.4975,4.4302,2.7473,0.0083,2.4174,0.3729,0.0001,8.7411,0.0003,1.7677,5.2812,1.2036,1.8557,1.8868,0.1253,0.6187,3.0543,5.0707,2.5385,5.7204,0.5593,0.1444,2.5595,0.1256,1.2454,3.9248,5.4883,0.9734,3.8397,1.0983,0.0152,0.1755,0.001,0.6616,7.2085,0.634,1.3924,0.1644,1.3407,2.8497,0.3495,1.0377,3.6446,0.7493,3.6356,1.4471,0.0012,0.9966,0.6666,0.0001,2.8647,5.2385,2.2576,1.5007,2.0299,2.6299,3.1428,0.0052,1.9046,2.1257,5.9278,8.7077,11.6472,8.9058,1.998,2.7419,5.9607,0.3593,0.7054,1.3299,3.3646,3.2125,5.2119,1.0125,0.6785,1.1911,2.3039,1.7671,1.3229,1.2878,0.0029,0.3022,5.3827,0.3739,3.463,1.6278,3.0101,1.7691,1.5501,0.759,0.4536,4.994,0.0033,3.6661,5.8078,0.7135,3.8849,0.4852,5.7152,1.7424,0.4756,0.9677,0.0002,1.7661,0.001,1.8268,2.1122,5.7225,2.3019,0.0211,2.1356,4.9951,0.2459,2.4258,1.0814,2.2552,6.4619,3.5098,1.4211,0.4349,4.9492,6.1781,0.0933,0.4751,5.301,12.3102,2.5662,5.7977,4.0724,2.6864,3.8129,2.1805,0.4751,1.9955,4.1889,7.9031,2.0898,2.704,0.7315,0.0002,7.5878,9.1815,7.8749,11.9127,8.1706,3.8136,5.0507,3.4417,0.2172,1.7541,4.0654,2.6587,10.5259,5.5424,1.9442,2.4588,3.337,7.2673,0.358,3.6216,6.8621,0.0099,0.9142,0.7792,8.4682,0.9408,0.1446,5.5683,5.1581,6.6952,5.4497,5.1081,0.7072,6.1066,0.0077,2.5133,4.0181,4.2782,4.7548,4.9784,2.7669,0.9532,4.7282,7.8104,0.549,6.8206,4.0444,1.8235,6.975,1.8987,1.573,2.3909,4.1953,0.8242,2.7811,0.2869,0.2456,0.6652,1.3907,0.4477,0.554,1.5587,2.5803,11.4085,6.2409,8.9443,0.0031,4.265,2.2779,2.6203,5.6111,3.0429,1.3016,1.5117,0.2862,0.2481,4.0129,0.6923,1.5113,5.8084,2.7078,3.1891,1.4527,5.0738,2.6703,3.0966,3.6987,0.1479,4.776,0.3235,1.5691,1.6245,3.4693,1.3435,0.046,2.8004,0.0529,2.9348,0.0106,1.1125,1.5252,3.915,1.9237,2.0499,0.4517,4.3262,0.4181,1.3486,1.1543,1.5113,1.2023,2.685,0.6337,2.5586,0.1199,3.0558,0.1387,1.1357,1.2409,1.3926,0.7254,0.0001,3.4149,0.0009,3.4455,4.5876,4.485,0.5106,3.2953,4.8457,0.1243,4.1181,5.3033,3.7069,1.0338,4.3305,1.7666,0.0546,5.9037,1.7358,0.106,2.1377,2.2007,0.8022,1.6157,2.2142,2.0886,5.0145,1.8958,1.0396,0.0558,1.8117,0.243,5.138,1.3824,3.0057,3.7145,0.554,5.8806,5.2876,0.6021,2.5165,0.1401,0.8889,4.549,1.8669,3.4386,0.3374,2.3314,3.3773,0.1278,0.5355,2.6525,8.2896,1.8766,1.5425,0.5364,2.7514,1.4387,5.7788,1.7367,2.4414,0.0038,2.9347,0.0013,1.1469,7.35,0.0735,1.5173,6.2071,3.3965,4.2675,7.2182,6.7829,4.7682,6.6225,0.0008,0.1152,2.9535,1.1886,6.3498,0.976,4.3657,5.9458,1.5254,0.4381,0.0002,1.2754,0.8378,1.0308,2.4175,0.2059,0.0467,0.4745,0.6854,0.0335,0.3082,8.627,0.6011,4.3112,1.9687,7.2016,2.0263,1.2926,2.2215,3.5039,3.004,2.2375,0.6679,0.1607,1.876,0.9566,1.28,1.8137,1.5062,1.883,0.2472,0.0345,2.7178,0.1754,0.0732,4.2939,7.7144,0.6191,0.3452,0.5417,4.0202,2.6933,2.7824,2.7689,0.975,1.4225,2.232,0.6762,3.1704,5.1856,0.6283,0.3658,0.354,2.666,2.9454,1.7402,2.8277,0.3937,5.8101,1.2162,3.8429,4.6294,1.6948,6.3473,4.5662,0.8103,1.2764,1.5293,8.657,4.4752,1.1104,5.1919,0.1611,6.3509,1.3687,5.8106,1.785,2.9138,3.3776,0.7893,6.0042,0.4858,0.7619,4.6358,3.4439,3.7142,1.7314,2.0279,7.1414,0.6601,6.1789,1.4715,3.3309,0.4465,2.2438,2.3306,0.0799,0.0185,1.5962,0.8854,1.1337,4.0109,3.04,5.548,0.0207,2.9586,0.5232,2.8926,4.6826,0.2367,0.48,0.4729,2.237,2.0135,6.1884,4.2563,3.4671,0.4305,3.28,4.7997,1.4389,3.9762,2.1348,3.1188,0.4532,0.0842,4.2437,1.2609,4.3428,3.6742,0.7507,1.0518,5.8465,0.4493,0.0006,0.2373,0.4839,0.0002,0.5571,0.1279,0.5653,5.9242,2.1615,3.3569,0.7839,1.1832,2.7212,2.7881,0.0802,0.055,0.1037,1.0269,5.2393,0.1738,4.3061,2.6447,2.7067,3.4508,2.5939,3.6608,3.1314,0.8806,4.6304,2.1242,3.151,0.0521,4.7954,0.9998,0.9518,2.6869,1.9573,0.3157,0.7414,1.7632,0.0493,0.1824,1.105,0.817,0.5366]}
{"id":1266,"ended":false,"length":599,"text":"USS Nicholson ( Destroyer No. 52 \/ DD @ - @ 52 ) was laid down by William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia in September 1913 and launched in August 1914. The ship was laid down on 5 October 1915, commissioned on 11 October 1915 and sailed  on 11 October 1916. Nicholson is the first of two commissioned destroyers to be awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) by the United States Navy on 5 December 2014. The squadron was the ninth ship to be awarded the honor for \"service and devotion\" to the United States Navy during World War I.\n\nThe ship was named for her German sailor, and was designated SS Nicholson on 5 November 1918.\n\nOn 14 June 1919, Nicholson was part of the USS Nicholson, which was sent to the North Atlantic as a squadron as part of the United States Navy. The ship was captured by British forces off Virginia in September 1921, while the crew remained in Washington DC until October 1922.\n\nOn 8 August 1918, Nicholson completed  in service as a torpedo vessel, which was assigned to the 5 May 1918 task force for the Central Pacific. On 29 January 1919, Nicholson was part of a mission for the United States Navy to help to liberate Australia. On 1 July 1919, Nicholson was part of the 9th Fleet which took control of the carrier, which was deployed in France in February 1922. The ship was destroyed in the French Gulf before it could take off, but recovered to escort the United States out of France. She was assigned to the 5 July 1918 Task Force for the Central Pacific mission of the 21 July 1918 task force which served as the primary responsibility of both the United States and Japanese forces in the Pacific.\n\nOn 24 March 1918, Nicholson was involved in the bombardment of Okinawa, and was killed by Japanese troops who were moving into the area at the time.\n\nOn 5 July 1919, Nicholson was found to have damaged the submarine's steering wheels due to a propeller failure.\n\nShe was transferred to the USS Nicholson for the purpose of redesignating her as a designated destroyer along with the other ships of the 9th Fleet. On 22 June 1919, Nicholson was replaced in the same ship which was still on operational patrol in New South Wales during the invasion of British Australia. On 30 January 1921, Nicholson was replaced by her subordinate subdeer. She was the last submarine of the USS Nicholson to be put to the test after being placed on the list of \"dislikes\" by the United States government in mid-1921 after being abandoned for a week on 13 March 1921. On 22 December 1922, Nicholson was removed from service as a torpedo vessel, and was replaced with a torpedo boat.

{"id":647,"ended":true,"length":581,"text":"Several critics \u2014 including both Kilmer's contemporaries and modern scholars \u2014 have disparaged Kilmer's work as being too religious, simple, overly sentimental, and suggested that his style was far too simple. Yet, Kilmer was a deeply spiritual, deeply personal, and highly skilled musician, and no less a virtuoso composer. Here are a few of his accomplishments, from his earliest recordings through the mid-1990s to his retirement in 2014. We must never forget his many personal inspirations.\nIn his autobiography, \"What You Want\" (1961), Kilmer described his artistic journey as a journey that started in his personal training as a pianist and played as a teacher. He then had an interest in composing music from the age of 13 onwards until he came to a point in his musical career as a soloist. He then moved on to perform with various orchestras and groups, starting with the San Francisco Symphony and the New York City Philharmonic under the supervision of John Powell (1906-1990) and later with orchestras like the Berlin Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic and the New York Philharmonic under the direction of conductor John Powell.\nHis first solo solo and work for major orchestras included concerts with the New York City Symphony, the Metropolitan Opera, the L.A. Philharmonic, and many famous orchestras such as the San Francisco Symphony, the New York Philharmonic, the Carnegie Hall, the New York Philharmonic and the University of Pittsburgh. Later in his career, he played with various major orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera, and the Carnegie Hall, then served in various capacities, retiring from the classical music in 1988 and beginning his own soundscaping company, A & T Music. His most famous solo work for major orchestras was \"How To Sing\", written by the pianist Joss Whedon.\nIn 1982, he played with the San Francisco Orchestra under the guidance of conductor John Powell (1923-2004) and then later with the New York State Teachers' Symphony and the Metropolitan Opera, and later with the New York Philharmonic. After working with the San Francisco Symphony as a pianist, he was named conductor of the San Francisco Philharmonic under the supervision of conductor John Powell (1932-1975) and then he was appointed conductor of the New York State Teachers' Symphony with the help of the New York Department of Schools, Department of Music, and New York City Council.

{"id":4129,"ended":true,"length":613,"text":"Similar to the 200 series, but mixed passenger and freight. 252 Originally ordered by the Ministry of Supply for intended lease to charter operators, but delivered to the Royal Air Force, in the final hours of the war, it was cancelled after a month's service.\n\nIn 1971, the company, along with a small number of other operators, bought up the rights to their charter of the 250 series \u2013 including the 250X2 \u2013 and sold the remaining space. By the summer of 1971 the plans were put on hold until the Royal Navy finally set up a fleet of aircraft to help combat the US.\n\nIt was only one year later that the 250 series was ordered again \u2013 and the air force had to deal with the loss of the last remaining pilot because his aircraft broke down as he attempted to land. After several years of operation, his crew was able to leave the air force with their gear. \"We'll go out on a limb here and say we were ready to stop the squadron because we had no choice but to use our skills and our strengths to fight the enemy. I would say we're fighting a war with a great number of people, so that's our final motivation, to leave this war in the light and secure sense.\"\n\nThe 250 series remained in service until the end of 1973, when it was bought back as part of the Air Force's Special Operations Operations programme.\n\nFor the final 25 years the air forces had limited their capacity as they continued flying their long-range fighter fighter fleet. Since 1991 this has been largely underlined by research into the potential use of aircraft similar to the 250 series that could be provided to the Royal Navy.\n\nThe first test aircraft arrived in early 1975, and the air force flew the plane to the British island of Grenada in April 1975 \u2013 but it was cancelled after two years of operation to protect the British coast from damage. After the initial successful test mission, the aircraft was launched into service in late 1976, with 250 planes operating for the Ministry of Finance between April 1985 and June 1986.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the 250 series there is an ongoing operation to build a new air force. The Air Force now runs more than 1,500 aircraft around the world, as well as the fleet built for defence applications.\n\nThe new aircraft is equipped with the required technologies for the war against the US. This includes a number of new types of stealth and stealth bomber systems, including those by the U.S. Air Force or the British Royal Air Force. This brings the total number in operation to more than 3,100.\n\nIt is likely that the 250 series will be equipped with a range of conventional aircraft including the 250X2. On the other hand, the British Air Force will continue its research into aircraft adapted to the current challenges with two more aircraft now being constructed.\n\nCurrently, the air forces have a range of more than 5,000 meters, which means the British can deploy the aircraft in situations where there is still no chance of combat. The air force currently uses seven aircraft. The new aircraft was designed in the following years, according to the air force, to take advantage of the current situation.","token_len":647,"entropy":[3.0952,1.396,10.2937,6.1521,0.9536,5.4455,9.5278,12.6089,1.4533,2.1034,3.321,12.424,10.4036,6.2777,2.8374,1.8873,6.674,0.0879,5.3697,2.803,9.509,11.5622,3.0091,8.6512,7.1285,1.3875,2.3593,6.5653,0.9044,1.2027,4.0518,2.1361,0.0364,3.3105,3.703,3.0386,5.2909,4.3364,0.2304,1.3915,1.2413,1.6003,4.1756,0.5232,2.8121,3.1731,2.3412,4.1712,3.0859,3.9445,0.6873,2.135,0.0138,3.3282,6.3525,0.4688,1.3055,4.8363,3.3827,5.4243,0.0015,3.0227,3.2705,1.4419,0.0061,1.4517,4.3598,0.3408,4.2684,3.977,1.0098,3.7953,0.2701,6.3157,4.4876,5.2618,2.4746,6.5325,1.101,6.0089,4.8012,1.0496,4.8513,4.9473,5.4314,2.4,0.7505,3.4709,2.0434,3.2689,5.3693,2.1779,4.2692,1.6819,5.2175,0.0438,2.0976,2.3672,6.3429,1.1119,3.7918,1.9117,0.3036,3.2735,1.1642,2.7718,1.6123,3.5203,6.409,1.0984,0.7002,1.6208,0.5549,3.72,2.1174,5.2912,4.2131,0.8746,5.8403,3.4487,0.7993,0.0003,4.0923,0.868,2.9486,6.4114,3.3767,0.532,0.672,0.6164,3.0351,1.5842,0.9453,3.6779,3.3471,2.8661,2.4112,2.2649,6.4692,1.0632,3.1188,1.6607,4.1619,0.0202,1.4156,3.6009,0.0906,1.4321,5.1631,2.4619,4.5463,6.7805,4.5008,2.58,6.4599,0.692,4.7955,2.6434,2.7883,0.0992,1.5373,1.6298,4.8162,4.0176,2.3202,0.5429,4.8255,0.7065,3.4204,5.4094,1.3245,2.9504,0.0067,5.2502,0.921,3.4651,0.1347,3.51,3.0614,7.4527,2.4662,5.9515,2.2496,5.6512,4.033,3.2343,2.0664,1.4762,2.3918,2.6421,1.3773,0.1904,1.7921,2.4919,5.6149,0.8125,6.6154,2.2444,7.4208,3.709,1.4493,1.5694,2.8005,2.859,0.7866,0.0188,5.0071,2.5673,4.7577,1.8261,2.8183,6.2123,1.0289,3.0607,1.557,1.045,2.5942,3.5346,3.8139,2.0964,1.7863,3.3507,5.4393,2.1185,2.2513,3.1679,1.8537,4.1937,3.1659,0.0267,2.2101,2.0412,3.153,2.8856,0.6294,3.3256,5.7983,6.3274,3.0383,2.4883,4.4779,3.2177,4.8755,3.036,1.4596,5.7309,3.3611,5.7938,11.8249,2.4547,0.2564,0.0003,1.7953,1.7409,0.9414,4.2711,0.883,0.2485,0.7992,1.5979,1.047,0.0173,3.0442,0.9532,0.4821,0.94,0.1838,3.7735,3.231,4.5871,1.7252,0.001,0.7722,3.9384,0.3361,0.9346,5.7699,1.2798,4.8211,3.4774,0.4024,1.5905,0.0002,4.5741,1.8354,5.3579,4.9381,0.0586,3.3981,5.098,5.1994,3.77,4.9837,3.4468,4.1651,4.3362,2.183,4.1551,6.5916,3.3248,5.5142,0.3522,0.4213,2.7082,5.3635,4.8326,0.9408,5.0153,5.8704,5.5216,0.793,1.2319,3.5798,5.7594,7.2996,0.1192,8.3335,2.1971,0.667,4.422,2.8359,0.0203,3.0324,5.3184,0.0892,0.3634,1.2068,0.4719,4.2355,4.7337,1.5093,5.4344,1.1647,1.0793,0.7578,0.666,1.0461,0.6133,0.0002,1.7906,4.3692,3.9671,2.5131,5.7569,0.584,3.6274,4.0038,0.9605,1.9665,2.1982,5.7762,0.1033,4.3381,1.8815,5.0732,3.3333,2.0351,5.2173,5.3762,0.04,4.3648,0.3344,0.986,3.7536,1.0832,3.7558,3.1713,1.9958,0.6,2.3734,1.8851,2.8853,1.0899,1.6963,1.7573,5.0554,3.968,0.6963,5.217,5.256,2.2447,5.1655,1.3956,4.9273,2.1536,4.3682,4.3982,0.9526,5.3005,0.6737,0.7686,2.3363,0.6945,6.1748,1.6194,3.8208,1.317,3.3077,1.8633,1.4467,2.5191,6.1289,6.2608,4.4037,3.2615,1.6988,6.7637,0.0236,6.7785,4.5084,4.531,6.2708,0.0475,2.0366,0.9547,0.1867,0.3969,0.0001,2.3624,3.5124,0.2893,6.8253,1.0897,1.9872,0.144,6.0916,2.1728,2.6982,2.2886,4.9493,0.7098,3.2772,1.2879,1.0267,3.9123,0.8103,2.5559,1.3584,2.5629,0.1065,4.4695,5.0555,4.3909,0.0867,2.8961,0.0668,1.701,1.7332,4.9831,0.0432,0.2407,0.96,4.3581,0.293,0.0023,2.859,5.6955,6.9524,2.4733,7.6728,6.6883,0.6219,0.88,0.0002,1.5691,3.85,2.1475,3.0926,3.8875,0.023,2.6726,6.6017,4.4114,2.5749,1.5486,5.636,1.9463,0.3474,1.8239,1.7161,4.1425,0.8103,1.9877,5.0133,0.0023,1.8562,4.1621,0.0671,4.7796,2.6841,3.7764,3.3896,3.5159,0.7947,1.9283,5.1255,6.0579,1.2038,4.7549,0.314,0.0188,0.1995,1.7421,0.0236,5.8738,1.0639,2.9376,1.1972,0.6936,0.0153,0.3356,4.1393,5.7439,0.6003,0.5204,0.4649,6.1963,3.3556,0.3919,1.8953,0.0057,2.9758,0.0175,3.1992,1.0531,0.469,0.0001,4.1428,0.723,4.8402,0.3944,0.814,2.5156,0.2059,0.6258,1.2632,5.4725,0.1714,1.7703,2.577,0.1683,7.1422,2.8139,3.6537,1.7602,5.1713,0.5956,0.655,2.3965,6.054,0.9491,1.4504,0.0591,0.2522,0.9356,5.0085,2.5748,0.1165,2.7134,2.5992,3.3631,5.3194,0.8733,2.727,5.3474,0.7055,1.3095,4.6894,5.6175,4.2054,6.2436,3.8902,1.7785,5.4749,2.2217,4.7372,1.2405,0.5992,0.0002,5.8977,1.2839,0.5511,3.212,3.1938,1.5517,2.4267,2.9032,0.0265,3.4119,0.0021,3.6933,0.0413,0.5467,7.3227,1.1565,2.6433,2.0871,2.2284,4.9261,4.2307,5.1902,3.4299,2.5772,2.2827,5.8865,0.7313,2.9702,0.4404,5.3145,3.0524,5.1948,0.2704,5.1857,0.4814,1.9974,3.5397,0.1873,3.7616,3.1389,6.4418,2.2137,3.2399,2.2429,3.3169,1.1515,4.6855,2.2536,2.7535,2.0437,6.7784,2.4165,1.9624,5.3893,0.0013,1.1988,4.3655,0.097,2.3226,1.376,4.4704,1.7408,0.0023,0.7289,3.2393,2.6614,1.1054]}
{"id":1586,"ended":true,"length":589,"text":"A tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on August 5, moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The system entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and quickly took center stage in the Atlantic Ocean. Although it stopped a few minutes late, the storm continued to move up the Pacific coast while a few minor tropical events kept it out of the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the end of August.\n\nThere are no official forecasts for the effects of Tropical Storm Delta. However, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports that this is \"the largest storm ever to make landfall on the Atlantic Ocean.\"\n\nOn August 6, the hurricane sustained sustained winds of 145 miles per hour. The storm was located near the eastern tip of the United States and was centered in the Atlantic. The storm was expected to reach its destination today in the Bahamas and Bermuda at 7 pm EDT. The hurricane crossed a line of north-south circulation that was expected to become a tropical storm on August 8 and become a hurricane in the Bahamas and Bermuda on August 9. The eye of Delta was expected to hit the eastern Caribbean coast shortly before 5 pm EDT.\n\nNHC data for the time of this writing indicated that Delta was centered about 1.7 miles southeast of Bermuda and about 1.9 miles south of the center. The storm was expected to pass in the western tropical north-south circulation.\n\nAt this time, Delta is not expected to affect major New England areas. To this date, the storm is expected to pass offshore of Bermuda and the Bahamas, only east of the equator.\n\nIt was unclear at this time that the storm would travel between New England and the Caribbean or the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nThe storm will continue to move into the eastern Atlantic this afternoon, moving into the eastern Caribbean overnight.\n\nForecasters expect to see the storm gradually move into the East as it moves northwards over the weekend and into the Pacific coast late in the day of August 16.\n\nMonday, August 17: The storm will be just north of the eastern tip of the United States and is expected to drop up to 5 inches in the next 24 hours.\n\nTuesday, August 18: The storm will gradually settle over the next 24 hours.\n\nThe storm is expected to move northwest toward Florida early Tuesday morning before cooling down over the next 24 hours.\n\nWednesday, August 19: The storm is expected to move northward and become an active tropical\/flora during the next week or until it stops moving north of the eastern tip of Florida late in the day or until late afternoon.

{"id":3594,"ended":false,"length":612,"text":"Within days, Simpson was heading east again, taking a flying boat to Batavia, where he joined the advance party of the I Corps, which was being sent from the Middle East by the United States. As he turned south on his way, a tank attack on the island led to his destruction, causing the deaths of two British tourists. Simpson then continued up the coast towards Washington and Virginia. But when a tank attack had struck a bridge over the southern horizon, he lost all strength and ran for his life. He later died, in St. Louis.\n\nAt one point, on September 4, 1988, Simpson was riding in his new Ford Expedition as a convoy from the US Central Command was heading from Beirut to Alexandria, Virginia. The convoy was about 1:45 pm EST (7:45 to 08:45 PST \/ 3:45 GMT). When he crossed the road towards Alexandria, the convoy stopped and remained stationary. He was also killed.\n\n\"During the ensuing fight and several days of fighting, our convoy lost two British and British soldiers, who were trying to get into the convoy, but managed to evade the attacks. As part of a mission to rescue British passengers, some were killed by the vehicle\", wrote Sgt. Brian McNaughton in the memoir \"Onward\". \"A group of Americans went along with the convoy in a boat under Captain David McClellan,\" he added. \"After they passed the convoy at Alexandria, they turned toward Iraq on a reconnaissance ship.\"\n\nThe US Embassy in Alexandria, where Simpson was serving at the time, would not respond to messages from Newsweek at that time and could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThough the crash occurred in a bridge that overlooks the town of Alexandria and the Alexandria River, where the car was crashed, only some of the bodies were found later in the day at a camp on Alexandria beach, as well as the body of another American.\n\nThe body of Ian Simpson, who was killed when an explosive blew up at his car while he was in Iraq, along with the body of his sister, Nicole Simpson, is located in Alexandria.\n\nAt that time, it was reported that Simpson was a student at an Alexandria school. A military scholarship, while still relevant, was not at stake in the bombing.\n\nThe killing of Simpson came just two days after a truck bomb exploded at a gas station on Alexandria's southern outskirts, killing a policeman and injuring a truck driver, which caused an explosion.\n\nAmerican National Guard soldiers and police were dispatched in a similar attack in December 1998. Two soldiers and two police officers died of their injuries.\n\nThe first explosion occurred at 10:41 pm local time. On January 2, 1999, when the truck exploded at an Alexandria gas station, a bomb exploded three times in an industrial zone at the shopping mall's western entrance, which was adjacent to the mall. A car that was later destroyed had an explosive.\n\nA second explosion resulted in the death of a police officer, who died in an emergency room at the Alexandria County Sheriff's Office. At the time, there were no other known fatalities.

{"id":3173,"ended":false,"length":607,"text":"The episode progresses mostly through footage streamed from a fixed camera in booth nine of the call centre setting. Streams from other cameras are displayed on the side of the screen, in the lower left corner, and are shown on the right of the screen (below the \"Show all clips\" button). It's possible that a small number of clip-on clips, perhaps from one person or several, were shot in different locations for an entire week, but the timing is not lost on the viewers because the clips are shown in full resolution, in color and with full color. The clip-on clip-on clip-on was uploaded on one occasion, when he was working on a new video for the charity charity \"The World\", the channel that had the video on it. Once again, as on last week, he wasn't making progress. The other clips were cut at a later stage. The clips were then deleted from the list.\n\nCineviz reports that on the 24 January and 24 February, in addition to the two clips which were removed due to lack of sufficient footage, he added an additional one clip, where he recorded a small part, or two clips, of the game. Then, he recorded the whole segment on a video tape, as described earlier. On the first segment, Cineviz recorded a half-track clip which he uploaded. Then on 2 February, he uploaded the footage at a later time. He completed editing the rest of the segments and uploaded them to Google Drive on 24 March. Finally, on 21 April, he uploaded the video to Google Drive.\n\nCineviz has also taken the following steps :\n\n1. After watching the full series of games from the beginning and the last match of the season, continue to monitor the situation on the website (watch the first few minutes of the game below ) to see the end result from all previous weeks as well as the latest updates.\n\n2. After the match, watch the next few minutes of the match (if it's still up, then click on the \"Live\" button in any window) and choose whether or not you would like to watch the next few minutes of the game (if you are streaming it during any other time you would like to participate, etc.). Do not forget to add an comment, and to report any errors or inconsistencies.\n\n3. Follow these steps with your friends to make sure they get all the information they need and watch the match :\n\n1. Click on the video you want to watch on the news channel\n\n2. Choose the \"watch\" button\n\n3. Find the \"stream\" button and click on \"Live\" in the same window.\n\n4. You can now complete the whole game by clicking on the \"download\" button.\n\n5.

{"id":1616,"ended":true,"length":621,"text":"The character of Walter Skinner had evolved over the course of The X @ - @ Files'sixth season. At the start of season six, however, the producers and writers felt that the final episode should have been filmed as late as season two, rather than \"spoil the ending of the last series of X @ - @ Files. It's hard to say if it will be \"more\" of a season-long finale (or at least the beginning of season two), but I suspect that will leave us with an ending that we are unsure of.\n\nIt'd be interesting if the finale of The X @ - @ Files was finished early, as we know from the initial showrunner's notes, but I doubt that that will happen as quickly as it was intended.\n\nOn the bright side, it really seems like you can see that the writers at X @ - @ Files really thought a \"spoiler\" ending for season six was a decent idea. I'd expect the series creator to have done that, though.\n\nI'd love to see the end of the first season and find that satisfying, with something to fill my boredom, or at least have time for, some time to breathe in the light and see if the writers were as clever as me :o)\n\nAww, I feel for you! It really is sad... (and that would make me hate my job too)\n\n\"For all the fun that one could have with this, one can only go on seeing how it goes... and being able to do what I want to do with it\"\n\nYou're not alone...\n\n\"He who goes along with the plans of the man who makes the plans of the man who makes the plans of the man who makes the plans of the man who makes the plans of the man made of\".\n\nThis is the most poignant episode I've watched in years (and I have not yet seen anything else yet). It's like watching someone die on Christmas day and it was so incredibly sad. I thought it was going to be a fun and memorable episode, but I absolutely hated it. This was a fun and memorable episode which was exactly what *I* wanted to see during the last show, but the final episode wasn't any fun. The ending was actually really good and I'm very much looking forward to it. But it's going to be an eternity.\n\nFor all the fun that one could have with this, one can only go on seeing how it goes... and being able to do what I want to do with it.\n\n\"It is rather unfortunate that we need to put such a small thing like making every little moment about the last season in the final act of the fifth season to the end... but it is ultimately a happy ending\"\n\nYes! One of the best moments of the series, really! And I would absolutely love to see that ending! I know it won't happen in the last season because they could just cut off a few episodes of the last season and not do anything.

{"id":4892,"ended":false,"length":519,"text":"In the Victorian period, pamphlets started circulating in favour of the removal of the livestock market and its relocation outside of the City, due to its extremely poor hygienic conditions as well as the risk of the livestock population contracting infection from the production of a certain variety of livestock, or the introduction of other viruses, while they were still being grown inside the market. As the popularity of their existence was increasing, there was a strong argument that this was the right time to be doing away with the market and leave it aside.\n\nThe abolition of the livestock market became very popular in Victorian countries, where animals and society were inextricably linked due to the high demand for comfort. However, the fact that the market was completely removed from Victoria meant that the supply of them was greatly diminished. The Australian government allowed to enter the market for some seasons in April 2019 and its market was then again re-introduced a few months later.\n\nAccording to the Australian National University, in the Victorian period and in England in the 1700s, Victorian pigs were the most commonly produced animal. The Victorian pig was known to have a strong affinity with meat. As part of its breeding programme, it was first bred and consumed by Australia\u2019s pig farmers, who were also responsible for supplying the pig with pig blood.\n\nHistorical statistics\n\nSee also\n\nIn addition to the abolition of the livestock market and the relocation of its market to smaller areas, various other major changes have happened in the Victorian animal kingdom of the late 1800s and into the early 1930s.\n\nFairy tales\n\"It was the most beautiful place that could always be,\u201d said Merton. \u201cThere were no restrictions on the size and the way of life and the way in which animals were treated, but you had some of the best and most intelligent animals that I had ever grown up with. When we were in the garden, dogs were not allowed to eat, but there were times I could\u2019ve said \u2018there goes it now\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn England, there was a very difficult time for traders as they were forced to sell in the markets. In 1900, they were allowed to start at the entrance of the market, where they would continue for some time until animals in the markets were removed, and the government allowed the owners to sell animals without restrictions on their ability to pay wages or to be able to get a guarantee that they would not lose any money.\n\nCadillos of Gurney Castle\nCadillos\nCadillos\nCadillos\nCurfew of

This was his last visit to India for many of the other dignitaries that we had met in the past. It was always a dream of mine to visit the country and to give a statement in the hope that this country will return to its sovereignty.\nThis will surely be done at a time when the situation in this country feels so bad. We are just beginning to recover from this shock as there are no casualties due to the ongoing conflict, but there is still a lot of sorrow left for us to share.\"\nSapang, a noted political analyst, was the first president to visit the country since its independence in 1947 and said that in the next few years, as more Kashmiris migrate to South Asia, many will be taken back through the process.\nHe said while the leaders in Kashmir and across the world are celebrating the birth anniversary of the country's first democratically elected leader, they have failed at their duties, and are focusing on the current situation.\n\"I have known the president since when he came to India, and since we had a relationship which was first formed in 1947. We are witnessing another epoch. With such strong leaders who have taken part in every national and international event we have seen so many Kashmiris who have lost their hearts. What we should be focusing on is trying to find a solution to the situation and the fact that they are now being attacked again by armed men. I know they are suffering due to an increasing anti-India movement everywhere and I think there is still a lot of disappointment for all the parties involved in the struggle,\" he said\nSapang also said the entire nation is united under the cause of Kashmir.","token_len":650,"entropy":[8.1335,12.0026,6.7273,6.2875,1.4976,4.7738,1.3723,1.2613,2.7126,0.5712,7.7588,1.1728,8.5352,1.3898,10.9694,3.6131,0.4662,6.8906,5.0402,11.1086,11.2182,3.319,7.4824,6.8555,4.4569,2.1891,7.7014,4.3604,13.8736,4.8683,9.5199,7.5372,1.893,7.3817,8.491,8.8414,5.1745,9.6987,4.0863,4.5777,5.5096,0.5431,3.0341,2.9933,2.4002,2.9219,3.55,1.0136,2.8039,2.346,1.5944,4.7035,2.495,3.8568,6.8092,8.1107,2.2431,2.6389,1.0768,4.5686,0.0015,0.0001,0.0004,0.0003,0.0007,4.1505,4.5537,4.1346,3.9059,4.553,3.8202,4.2787,4.1345,4.3684,3.3616,0.4446,4.75,4.5531,7.082,0.4661,0.8762,7.1298,3.9071,1.4144,3.2163,3.4483,0.0002,9.6496,0.2031,11.9993,0.4156,7.0382,6.4283,0.2244,4.4031,2.957,1.7288,0.1388,1.0115,2.9638,0.0041,1.728,2.5395,2.3673,4.2513,6.211,1.5237,3.3141,0.0013,1.9954,0.5906,4.9074,2.3396,5.9918,3.3625,0.0105,0.3392,0.7382,7.579,3.1902,5.5117,7.0622,3.818,2.6502,2.8746,3.3707,8.6949,0.6299,4.5659,2.3684,2.8998,4.3208,0.0522,4.5166,4.403,1.2388,0.552,1.7341,5.5092,0.9134,4.9364,3.0192,0.0167,0.025,0.6898,0.674,3.679,2.1104,2.8431,1.6571,1.8912,3.1465,0.1338,2.3138,0.1002,2.064,0.8717,5.9412,3.0643,4.1362,3.9913,3.596,4.4357,4.483,5.9627,4.8976,3.7102,6.1249,4.3511,2.2188,6.3464,1.175,5.1281,5.2504,5.8417,1.6353,1.6446,1.7949,5.9492,3.3746,5.2342,4.0416,0.5264,0.3264,3.7735,0.9636,1.7458,5.1824,0.9893,5.1157,1.8293,1.9083,2.9491,0.5319,0.3267,1.8013,1.4433,1.104,1.2087,3.5195,2.311,1.1597,4.3392,4.3129,4.26,0.5538,2.1669,2.554,5.2321,1.256,5.499,1.647,3.6646,2.9797,0.5973,4.9134,0.5052,2.2161,2.0936,6.2658,0.0315,3.8438,5.9668,3.0777,0.9098,6.5908,0.769,0.7697,2.4651,1.3906,6.1428,4.1963,4.4702,0.9721,0.267,1.7488,1.0507,1.7754,3.0898,4.8337,2.2942,4.8586,0.2549,4.1267,0.7981,3.0699,4.3713,3.9515,2.1677,2.891,3.6468,3.3463,5.0373,6.4577,1.9491,5.3183,1.0964,3.9214,4.8556,0.6376,0.2466,2.3833,2.1973,1.1849,5.053,0.5627,3.8435,1.03,6.1306,2.3694,5.1789,3.4112,2.2434,5.6151,5.0592,1.5928,1.1402,6.3174,0.5745,8.5585,1.3274,0.2942,2.0904,3.4154,0.8735,5.1067,2.8944,5.0423,4.0129,0.562,0.2957,2.4621,4.1071,1.6956,0.5488,2.5524,4.5306,0.8154,2.4527,0.0123,0.7337,5.3481,1.8415,3.9768,0.3856,3.9247,3.5124,1.3132,2.844,0.8748,1.6465,2.7104,2.0674,2.539,2.5115,4.6247,4.8061,4.0952,0.3977,1.4666,4.7694,2.8719,6.9495,1.4786,5.9238,4.4997,0.0266,0.0001,4.3386,3.9313,2.3932,2.9488,1.7825,1.4287,0.9938,1.2035,2.5563,0.8719,5.7877,1.9272,2.5326,1.2191,1.1411,0.5978,1.5153,1.7025,0.8963,1.7716,2.1641,4.2038,1.6411,5.906,2.9628,1.7256,3.5235,0.5824,1.9349,0.9841,2.3115,0.8476,0.2983,0.207,0.6911,1.475,2.3902,4.0993,4.3668,4.9904,1.1542,4.6369,3.983,1.3782,0.502,0.2339,1.4141,3.6278,0.9046,5.0736,0.3004,6.94,3.5081,2.8728,1.7968,2.3707,1.9896,5.4223,3.3305,0.5261,2.9048,0.8984,1.9274,4.6282,4.4425,4.0326,1.1654,3.0573,5.9846,4.8912,0.0077,0.8373,4.2858,3.5416,3.347,1.6064,2.2606,1.1621,1.5209,1.0397,1.2793,0.469,5.5427,4.651,2.7167,2.8883,4.8723,4.5241,3.2839,0.2893,2.6471,0.1712,0.099,3.0011,2.8284,7.5113,2.7903,1.8529,0.6433,1.7153,2.7567,1.5611,3.8404,0.5427,1.2601,1.1282,1.4084,2.0163,4.5394,0.4548,1.0599,0.4055,2.5254,4.9091,1.4019,4.3682,1.3249,3.7351,1.2722,0.5578,0.8315,4.7308,3.3179,5.0363,0.4927,4.6659,0.4892,5.7016,0.3006,0.3897,4.8104,1.9806,2.2407,5.6736,1.4623,6.9449,1.1198,2.4505,1.6955,0.3709,0.9078,0.8744,5.5099,1.4891,6.61,2.9695,3.0451,3.3343,3.901,0.4155,1.4742,1.6328,6.0438,1.0969,4.7848,2.4236,0.1069,1.5679,1.8401,0.7131,1.0979,2.354,0.0785,1.6741,0.3057,2.5878,2.4201,3.5132,5.3917,2.6091,3.2065,3.159,2.0877,2.5836,6.1612,0.457,1.7785,5.3131,1.8466,1.0814,0.2917,1.265,2.9101,2.3192,4.5593,1.7911,3.2689,2.5815,5.2777,0.4015,2.7375,0.448,1.0356,2.2365,0.8638,5.0847,3.6639,3.1089,2.4159,3.7218,3.6991,1.3989,5.1015,3.5854,1.0779,1.374,1.2111,1.9628,2.2244,4.51,4.6867,6.0957,2.8153,5.5275,3.9951,3.8108,2.0826,3.4883,1.3008,3.9273,3.2648,0.0972,4.4819,6.1033,2.3392,1.3044,1.8469,4.5478,0.5372,1.7303,3.6628,1.1788,8.0029,0.3969,3.1376,1.3469,2.8272,0.3149,3.5974,2.5768,4.9113,1.8825,3.9363,1.6959,3.4926,0.0725,0.469,5.4401,0.0414,3.1912,1.1095,2.0315,0.9497,1.0545,2.4329,2.0944,3.7356,4.7217,0.1292,3.4354,1.0223,4.0539,3.2209,4.9448,5.4055,2.0014,3.8501,3.1506,1.4434,2.9857,3.4621,3.2453,0.7975,4.0843,5.3173,0.0043,5.3153,4.1522,6.8944,0.015,0.9982,3.1542,7.4576,1.9831,2.1847,3.2198,3.1972,0.7253,3.4945,0.7391,0.6337,0.4717,6.0915,2.7872,3.4692,2.0367,5.8512,1.7545,1.5959,1.1363,3.0618,2.0734,0.4198,0.2451,5.5109,2.482,0.0765,0.0148,2.1928,1.0826,1.9413,6.8441,3.3975,2.2267,3.3651,4.4664,0.5778,5.2865,0.1117,1.6014,1.0887]}
{"id":1815,"ended":true,"length":609,"text":"The two ships differed slightly in size. Principe Amedeo was 79 @. @ 73 meters ( 261 @. @ 6 ft ) long between perpendiculars, while Palestro was 78 @... [M].\n\nAfter an accident in a port, they returned to the country and started the construction, while they made two attempts to cut the ship out, the first one failed and the other was delayed \u2013 they were unable to do so because the ship was too long for the equipment to be delivered. Both failed, but were recovered in the port after a very long time and the ship was recovered and repaired.\n\nThe 3-meter hull of the ship sailed slowly from one place to another due to the wind, but the other one had the opposite effect because the wind accelerated the ship. The crew was surprised by the ship\u201ds size, and were astonished to find that the ship was so small. The ship was in the final stage of its construction when it hit the water, and had to be rescued or lost both times.\n\nOn 25 July 2008, the ship was recovered from the sea by a boat with a rescue crew who were able to get out safely of the wreckage. Then, the boat was repaired and brought back, but unfortunately, without the support equipment that could be collected.\n\nThey went back to the country in February of last year, and their ships were brought back home again where they were repaired almost identical to their original design. But they still remain in the port of Turin and it is almost impossible to obtain them back.\n\nDespite the fact that the two ships had to be rebuilt and rebuilt again (from the original cost), the two ships were repaired and repaired in the southern side by the Ministry of National and Trade.\n\nOn 27 July 2010, the two ships were returned to Turin following a technical fault to land on the coast of Portugal. After the rescue, the two ships were returned to Turin and the crews of the two of them left for Turin.\n\nOn 8 August 2011, the two ships were returned to Turin, and were returned to Portugal as part of a successful rehabilitation in the port. In October 2011 they were allowed to start at Porto.\n\nOn 26 February 2012, two new ships were officially added to the Turin fleet and returned as part of construction. On 22 March 2012 they were brought to Turin after a technical fault.\n\nBoth of the newly designed ships survived the accident, and the repair and replacement of both were completed very fast.\n\nThe third ship which was first to be brought back to Turin on the 11th June 2014 had to be completely rebuilt. In the end, they were rebuilt in the port and finished the first two ships on the same day.\n\nOn 19 May 2017, two new ships were launched and the crew of the ship resumed work as expected. Only the one ship that they completed completed the last stage of repair and repair and a second ship took time off of his work.\n\nThe replacement of the previous ship in order to repair the current one had been done by a team from the Italian Coast Guard (Italy\u2019s coast guard).","token_len":651,"entropy":[6.0475,6.8213,9.8598,4.3609,0.6611,1.7303,1.9155,11.3071,2.4063,0.0004,5.2729,12.0952,1.4517,2.5505,1.7224,8.5808,12.9078,8.6667,9.0052,7.2625,5.8041,2.437,11.7642,6.2416,1.4372,7.0868,4.5976,4.0679,4.1645,4.5372,8.7082,11.5669,1.807,1.4355,1.6487,11.5162,8.5691,1.5924,3.0815,0.3604,9.2216,4.8855,8.6926,7.0564,2.3598,0.1704,5.2098,4.5051,5.0411,1.8236,4.2515,5.0229,1.9062,4.6045,3.6311,0.1815,1.6572,6.3684,2.0267,4.3911,3.0191,3.2404,4.7051,3.8931,4.0452,4.3575,4.7093,5.2835,0.3563,6.3252,1.5565,3.8377,4.2842,3.1624,3.6887,1.4859,1.8909,3.2487,1.9238,0.9158,2.0426,3.1446,5.3638,8.6284,3.0218,2.3028,3.2073,0.0138,3.2948,0.6382,2.409,1.5377,2.0319,0.8732,1.6583,3.6543,3.0737,0.7925,5.5724,1.9426,1.4063,5.1075,0.7103,4.994,4.908,1.5737,1.485,4.229,5.0715,2.7775,1.405,3.3149,4.0162,2.237,4.7579,1.2887,2.2847,2.8994,1.9846,2.0088,0.7279,4.0592,2.4624,3.2223,0.6413,0.7634,0.0004,1.7939,6.6717,2.9473,3.0628,6.236,1.3295,0.6383,2.9545,7.9064,4.9353,3.6671,2.9508,4.7431,0.1583,0.2358,6.3197,0.0076,0.7523,4.9141,1.6235,1.7175,1.8542,4.9657,3.5126,3.0668,3.4067,5.7348,2.0889,4.726,1.6083,1.4327,7.2626,1.4529,1.0019,2.2862,1.4031,4.5361,2.2445,5.1137,2.1667,0.6111,3.9955,17.3582,8.0535,4.7229,4.1625,1.1585,1.7334,3.3673,4.6923,1.2789,1.0733,0.5901,1.1921,1.3734,0.8792,3.3079,1.3333,1.9992,1.869,2.2163,1.0607,4.3312,2.075,5.7675,1.5728,0.0729,2.4119,1.0449,3.3655,0.9471,4.5261,0.794,2.1851,1.5391,1.0557,4.0246,0.9932,0.4993,3.1519,6.5946,4.6624,6.9121,5.1149,0.4954,0.6969,0.0004,4.1734,5.6587,2.7259,5.5933,0.4147,0.9509,2.5843,0.901,3.8066,1.9365,0.3169,2.0586,1.5694,2.2226,3.7358,3.819,1.6335,4.7918,1.1124,3.4629,1.9222,1.7235,0.0056,3.0009,2.968,3.417,6.8278,0.1678,3.5713,0.6913,6.5119,1.423,1.6145,4.3859,1.3545,3.6665,1.0417,3.316,0.4994,4.744,1.4007,4.6465,0.7483,6.046,1.2121,4.2571,4.9558,3.2481,3.0121,0.9477,6.4421,2.3683,0.7663,0.0003,4.9613,4.4905,1.3152,0.2198,1.0759,1.9777,2.5404,3.5549,3.6797,4.7482,0.0285,1.0893,0.8823,4.7311,4.8423,1.2928,4.1917,0.2196,5.0725,2.282,7.1044,0.355,1.571,3.1971,7.4133,7.372,0.2547,1.7955,1.6651,3.2632,0.4265,4.7418,2.5565,2.3257,5.7346,1.4139,0.9393,2.9136,1.4021,6.2141,0.0789,2.3776,4.658,0.845,5.8875,0.5942,0.195,4.2427,2.9413,2.984,1.1374,0.5586,0.0003,6.312,1.068,2.0086,0.0574,1.0318,3.0904,0.4716,3.2886,3.1725,0.795,3.0397,2.6771,2.97,0.9939,4.9827,4.7897,1.0334,2.6904,7.1918,2.1601,1.2633,3.3846,1.3648,1.7645,4.3873,1.8866,2.8982,3.7405,1.77,6.574,5.3557,4.6527,1.4494,6.5708,0.1019,5.3097,5.5226,5.3879,3.2793,1.0073,0.0003,3.6486,3.544,1.4138,2.5478,0.1705,0.7203,1.8886,0.3235,0.8579,2.1851,0.1688,1.9413,0.0011,6.0569,1.3608,5.6154,3.8759,5.6365,7.3646,1.9498,0.6037,3.2365,0.9973,4.9003,0.6179,3.8264,2.1169,4.8076,1.3094,0.8045,0.8013,0.3491,0.7339,1.8238,0.1862,2.4299,0.0015,1.7063,1.7663,6.1569,2.0944,0.4224,0.7045,5.8794,0.2353,5.1781,2.4624,3.7068,0.004,1.0845,0.5634,0.0002,2.3487,2.9677,1.3793,2.5719,0.0933,0.6064,0.7998,0.212,0.7791,1.3869,0.1512,1.5565,0.0021,2.1487,1.5156,3.7183,2.6076,0.3253,3.2964,3.4456,1.1085,0.0016,1.3922,6.7748,4.1472,4.0304,1.1398,1.3363,1.6761,4.2382,3.5932,0.9661,3.5054,0.5961,5.265,0.2486,5.3022,6.5126,3.3454,1.7534,4.6904,0.6207,0.0002,1.7539,3.9406,3.0276,0.4387,0.1155,3.5816,4.0241,1.3314,0.8772,5.5061,3.5456,0.239,0.1358,6.2857,0.0067,2.3653,2.9825,5.5263,3.5589,0.4288,0.0016,5.9188,1.276,3.8762,3.7707,1.2332,0.2729,2.9269,0.4638,3.2515,1.6885,1.9334,0.0115,4.0429,1.3493,1.3834,0.2375,1.8235,0.9033,0.0002,5.3116,1.8841,0.8972,4.4903,4.5859,1.3337,7.7749,0.8018,1.6051,1.4509,1.0148,2.0655,4.6925,2.5703,3.9225,0.6541,2.4839,3.448,1.1951,5.2762,2.6523,0.4503,0.7592,0.0002,1.7751,4.7306,0.773,4.1327,0.9327,5.2009,2.2724,0.6965,2.8494,0.6166,0.6373,0.5087,0.0034,3.3457,3.1442,4.6275,1.1399,4.0482,3.1526,4.4175,1.3915,0.3553,5.2272,1.0023,1.8662,3.6212,2.0191,2.7335,0.2832,3.1542,0.6504,4.087,2.0902,1.3057,0.9552,2.8707,5.8233,4.1012,3.1541,4.0095,1.9764,3.5473,1.0434,2.0122,1.3942,0.5055,0.5089,0.0002,2.1533,3.5927,2.2967,3.3473,0.1813,2.46,0.9374,0.3805,0.2947,5.3484,2.6331,2.5021,4.2779,0.5995,0.5112,3.6808,5.8714,3.3129,3.9751,4.7593,0.3944,6.2292,1.7606,3.3067,3.2459,2.1256,5.0798,6.3128,5.5923,1.146,4.6501,3.3386,0.5157,4.0867,1.1167,3.3688,3.2377,4.8458,1.2991,0.9458,5.6075,5.8508,2.2408,4.7061,7.3587,3.3904,1.5645,0.6272,0.0002,1.7152,7.0513,0.3926,0.4709,4.9346,2.5997,3.6603,4.9521,0.0349,3.7874,0.6266,5.4163,0.3321,4.2144,2.7449,2.3075,1.7776,2.1152,1.6589,1.9218,0.7794,4.2881,3.6755,0.055,2.9795,3.8017,8.8931,6.7531,6.0961,2.7622,0.3045,1.3602]}
{"id":1341,"ended":true,"length":622,"text":"A successful generalist predator, the cougar will eat any animal it can catch, from insects to large ungulates ( over 500 kg ). Like all cats, it is an obligate carnivore, and can tolerate the small animals that it finds, most notably raccoons. The cougar will use his power, its speed, and its prey to kill other prey, and in the end it will be capable of destroying any creature it can find. Because cougar is a predator, it cannot be stopped, thus, it will continue to prey on everything and make new attacks. The problem with cougar is that, due to its low density, it can fall prey only as often as one time per day if it takes long to get the food it needs. Its ability to get a lot of food on its home soil will have an effect on the prey, i.e., reduce the ability to hunt with cougar. Thus, the cougar will also be able to kill many prey on its home soil because of its low density, and use that food to kill all prey.\nConvection power can destroy other prey by creating a mass of ice where the ice has been trapped. The ice forms a large, dense wall that can break away if the cougar falls prey. This means that when the ice is swallowed up, the ice will freeze as well. If the ice collapses within 2-3 months, then it will take its time to break free, thus making its prey more vulnerable when it gets too hot.\nConvection power is a function of many of the other qualities that serve as the natural energy source. A strong desire for the energy, coupled with the need to eat or live, can give a person power that increases the probability of survival and the likelihood of survival.\nThe most powerful energy sources for the most successful generalist predator are the energy to consume, the energy from the body. While there are others that can be used like electricity, water, and even magic, these are the few that are strong enough to power a whole person or entire household.\nFor generalist predators, power is their best friend as they are able to use their power to destroy everything they see on their way to survival. Even if they do not fight, they often keep losing. However, if the animal needs an outlet, and the predator knows the resources that are available (for example, when to prey, or to attack and\/or to prey), they can use the power of power to destroy or destroy everything they see and any animal that can come up in a fight. The problem is that if the predator can use the power of power, he may lose because he is relying too heavily on the animal to survive. On the other hand, the animal is also making more power from the power to destroy the prey. Therefore, if the predator can use the power of power, he will not be able to eliminate the prey that they fight against. Thus, the overall energy of the predator and the animal could be greatly reduced.\nAccordingly, it is desirable to provide a generalist predator power that has the abilities that enhance its ability to destroy and destroy many (or all) of these prey.","token_len":652,"entropy":[9.2038,7.8584,5.7829,12.1316,1.6631,2.6488,9.997,0.1807,3.018,4.1145,2.5588,2.6645,1.8009,1.3673,2.8286,1.3566,3.9508,4.235,0.4345,4.166,8.067,0.7289,0.0827,3.3465,13.6842,4.1567,3.4177,2.8314,5.997,2.4295,5.0325,0.2174,1.8261,1.8888,3.7868,4.9175,0.0385,1.1058,0.0458,1.3998,1.6182,2.8819,3.7402,3.2658,5.1857,3.7574,2.1739,1.6982,3.644,3.1259,5.808,1.4149,6.9957,0.0561,0.0,1.9856,2.4682,1.0438,0.0169,2.1641,4.5375,4.9114,6.4737,4.4769,4.5959,4.0996,0.4797,0.4851,0.8596,6.5117,0.576,4.4798,3.6988,4.2177,1.6031,2.3507,4.2296,2.1675,2.891,2.122,0.4587,3.2201,5.9341,0.0267,4.0853,2.7137,3.8155,1.0935,2.7069,1.4585,0.5932,4.7398,3.3054,1.9245,3.5958,1.3465,3.7414,0.4291,0.8986,4.2234,1.3396,5.3155,1.95,5.996,3.3246,1.1581,1.5029,4.1747,0.264,3.5483,0.5294,6.7488,3.8034,5.5826,5.832,3.4961,0.89,2.4452,6.3186,0.7356,1.782,0.463,0.6024,0.2852,3.4921,3.2593,0.0018,0.4682,4.1722,4.9102,0.4349,0.4382,1.8168,6.958,0.6479,5.6969,6.7912,3.6403,0.0774,4.6857,6.5205,3.1808,0.6653,5.493,1.0293,4.8304,5.0247,2.3206,2.4953,3.4502,2.9709,1.0856,0.1661,0.3203,5.0844,3.4709,0.0259,4.5617,3.9196,2.7844,0.0802,0.2837,4.4756,1.9517,6.954,3.1132,4.2155,4.0713,2.3963,0.7851,0.2501,1.5139,4.3778,2.6454,7.3864,0.0024,0.0003,0.4601,6.8506,1.0316,4.2921,1.314,3.2252,4.8025,3.6177,0.4717,0.5143,4.8012,0.1132,2.1661,1.5496,0.0025,1.1994,4.346,1.996,1.3307,0.0049,3.4334,3.3721,2.1331,4.8797,0.6332,1.0363,0.1845,5.4273,1.2001,0.2798,1.6502,0.19,1.9548,1.8281,5.7924,3.158,2.0181,0.5838,2.8777,3.2376,2.8181,1.7855,1.8917,8.7213,4.864,1.3613,7.8234,5.3067,6.4074,4.116,1.6916,2.8732,5.2021,1.2059,4.3889,0.4536,4.8927,5.9624,1.5409,1.7268,3.7883,2.0194,4.2716,1.1578,2.042,1.6653,5.2438,1.1505,3.3098,3.323,2.8723,3.8494,2.0771,2.0772,3.3145,4.0126,3.6123,1.3281,1.3469,0.0019,5.1266,1.1824,2.3796,2.2523,4.3806,0.3762,3.267,1.1814,1.8049,1.3609,6.3468,1.3946,0.9921,0.9967,3.0749,1.0496,4.5775,4.7249,1.4974,0.9786,3.2294,0.5937,2.0568,4.9223,5.7987,4.8238,1.3501,0.3552,5.1408,0.4665,2.7691,2.6876,0.267,4.2496,4.2498,3.0478,0.1256,2.3071,2.1273,1.8449,2.8437,3.2946,3.2834,0.9119,2.5276,0.858,6.2544,0.788,3.1149,2.1686,3.8517,0.381,1.9315,3.3541,0.2151,0.0537,0.4534,1.3024,2.1584,5.4397,0.0396,5.0605,5.3403,0.1358,3.8429,5.0596,1.5697,7.4618,1.4359,2.2587,4.996,4.2655,1.8686,2.8797,4.0076,4.4094,6.9526,1.1093,3.4293,3.9905,2.6465,3.2895,0.0028,1.8847,2.7061,0.4309,2.8678,3.5186,3.6488,0.881,1.9957,3.889,1.7662,4.6262,4.062,1.6923,4.2971,1.611,4.8009,0.3424,0.7348,2.8106,2.9928,3.5643,0.1669,0.9013,1.5166,2.1802,2.1282,3.5699,2.0248,3.8269,2.7545,3.0199,1.7818,6.049,4.8484,1.6416,0.1989,1.438,0.455,1.9424,3.6131,6.0968,4.2247,1.2068,1.3251,0.7118,3.7938,1.1657,4.0417,4.9429,4.7838,3.162,0.4639,5.9986,1.2054,1.6041,1.4268,1.4062,5.1651,3.5599,0.6448,5.1183,0.2804,1.1806,2.3821,5.7078,0.5916,3.2759,0.856,1.9235,4.0102,0.4765,1.4047,4.8989,0.0077,0.1442,4.4417,1.4282,5.8574,5.1172,4.4277,2.8991,3.3628,0.3218,1.2122,4.4125,4.4989,0.3644,0.309,0.2587,3.3059,0.9946,6.0299,3.8799,2.2092,4.9931,1.001,1.8172,1.4982,0.0043,2.2652,1.2243,1.3618,0.6811,3.4044,3.4859,1.8535,1.9111,4.5895,1.679,3.9076,0.5602,5.2446,0.3875,5.212,1.4458,0.942,2.7371,0.2269,5.9095,1.2795,0.6946,5.2013,5.2597,8.2863,2.2487,3.7426,0.0229,2.0126,2.3637,4.16,5.7179,4.4325,3.482,1.0399,3.6051,1.9214,4.3416,3.9162,2.9965,5.7511,3.2907,1.5562,0.2717,5.0601,4.156,0.3195,0.2945,4.1257,4.3147,5.4339,1.7335,2.8782,3.5132,4.0942,5.0483,4.8188,0.0009,2.3953,5.3991,1.4301,0.9342,1.0436,1.1419,2.3151,0.6184,1.262,1.1572,0.2017,1.8513,5.2667,2.1641,1.8063,0.9937,0.1891,2.6306,5.4676,2.8587,1.2722,3.0246,4.3634,3.8533,3.6864,3.8331,1.1411,0.4523,2.9876,4.9305,1.6165,0.3598,3.3181,0.7658,0.4845,2.8049,2.6279,2.1673,0.2283,0.3309,0.1385,2.0835,3.3598,3.9072,3.2211,5.2553,1.5023,1.7979,6.9563,1.6474,1.1902,0.0414,1.4318,2.7764,1.6827,1.4631,0.4074,5.8067,0.1129,0.0525,0.0072,0.0173,2.723,1.9603,2.8209,3.5304,5.4428,3.5146,3.5752,3.5081,1.1755,0.7609,3.4567,1.8588,2.9056,1.7888,1.2701,3.0219,0.0606,1.8076,0.4237,0.2568,1.9649,0.7823,0.89,0.0949,0.1047,0.0626,0.8059,0.3834,1.8067,3.0782,1.7786,0.8859,0.0044,4.9362,0.8493,0.6308,3.1296,4.4542,6.0933,2.3657,0.8073,3.6737,0.0623,1.3959,6.2351,4.2588,2.1519,0.914,0.941,4.0059,0.8377,3.1615,5.4327,0.5854,4.4337,1.4069,1.0721,0.6082,6.2845,2.5326,0.0081,2.8285,0.3246,6.6447,0.7247,4.9521,1.7286,4.3448,0.1053,0.0453,5.2153,1.7899,3.6675,1.7539,6.3142,2.969,5.6902,2.0092,1.6083,0.098,1.7482,2.016,0.3498,5.0081,6.7944,1.7021,1.7832,0.0468,0.9134,4.5223,2.9831,0.6394]}
{"id":3113,"ended":false,"length":568,"text":"The quarterfinals took place over the weekend of May 16 to 17 at two neutral sites. The first doubleheader was sponsored on Saturday by Hofstra University, followed by games held at the United Sports Center at the same venue between the teams. The fourth matchup was also sponsored on Sunday, the day of the tournament, against Boston College, as an additional day-long, doubleheader slate of eight games.\n\nIn the men\u2019s side, the Patriots started with a 2-0 loss at home to No. 34 Maryland, while the Terrapins opened with a 1-1 loss to No. 6 Penn State. Penn State was able to gain some early momentum on Saturday after winning two of three overall, but held on to win by an impressive 6-3 margin.\n\nThe teams also played to a score of 35-33 in the men\u2019s third game, which was shut down due to heavy rain due to heavy snowfall, but that did little for the women\u2019s team in their final two games. The loss would have been more than enough for the Patriots to clinch an automatic berth in the women\u2019s tournament, but it had more significance for the game as it set up a rematch with the Bruins\u2019 second-seeded team.\n\nThe men\u2019s side, meanwhile, got back on track with their first doubleheader of their day, as they came down 3-3 against the visiting UMass Lowell Bruins. It was a scoreless affair until the end of the set, with Lowell pulling away for only nine points. But Lowell led 3-1 at the break and eventually tied the game in the end of the second frame. With the score tied at 1 again, Lowell shot the ball over the right post and into the end zone to tie the game at 3-3.\n\nThe Patriots responded with a huge rally that ended with a victory. After the first half of the night, they got off to a great start with a 17-3 run for the Patriots, which ended with four consecutive points to put up a fight. Lowell trailed 21-14 at the break and evened the score 10-7, but Lowell scored four more unanswered points to start the second half.\n\nWith Lowell tied at 30, Lowell pulled away and added another 5-3 score and took control of the match.

{"id":2818,"ended":false,"length":566,"text":"After graduating from Oxford, Hooper directed further television commercials, intending to break into the film industry the same way Ridley Scott, Tony Scott and Hugh Hudson did. He was introduced by Michael Moore as the writer\/director\/producer of \u201cTower of London,\u201d a movie that he directed and wrote himself.\nIt also inspired a series of films from the 1950s, \u201cThe Big Lie\u201d, \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d and \u201cNo Country For Old Men.\u201d\nHooper worked on numerous commercial movies for the Disney and Marvel movies, including the movie \u201cThe Hangover\u201d which aired on ABC in 1989.\nHe died in London on November 25, 2017 at the age of 89.\nHis most notable work was as a writer\/director. He worked for the BBC in his 50s, as a reporter\/producer\/screenwriter during the 1970s. He was also a producer\/director of several movies including the movie \u201cHalo\u201d and a short film \u201cA Brief History of Batman.\u201d\nHis life was followed by a long prison sentence for murder, torture and other crimes of which he was accused. His death caused speculation and outrage globally, particularly in Britain and the rest of the world where his sentence was the highest in the world.\nIn February 2020, his family revealed their grief when they learned that Hooper had passed away at the age of 100 after having become extremely ill. He was said to have \u201cnever been better\u201d but also that of his other family members.\n\"It was a sad news, that our uncle (Ridley Scott), the man who inspired such great films in the 1950s and the 1960s and into the early 70s, passed away on November 25, 2020 at the age of 89,\" Hooper's family members, John Travolta and Diane Rehm, told ABC News.\n\"We're devastated to hear this news of his passing. We love our uncle so much, and we'll miss him. He was a truly great man.\"\nThe Washington Post reports Hooper\u2019s death follows similar news which aired as a special feature in a film titled \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u201d. The movie was an Oscar best picture winner, which won four Golden Globe awards.\nAt least 1,600 people have signed a petition calling on Disney, Marvel, Disney and CBS to release a copy of the documentary and its sequel, \u201cThe Legend of Zelda in a New World.\u201d\n\u201cWith this news, we will have a glimpse inside the minds of these wonderful young men who set about the groundbreaking franchise that is Zelda: Breath of the Wild, making game-changing games with real-world gameplay, with exciting storytelling, and now with the most innovative gameplay in the history of Zelda,\u201d

The characters in Wang Shiu's story are actually from her childhood, and in order to survive this traumatic event, they also have to have this attitude of \u201clife to live\u201d. These characters are all in the same place - Wang Shiu and his parents 'Big Buddha' and 'Sikh Ghar' who are also in the same place.

{"id":145,"ended":true,"length":607,"text":"Stansfield's first club was Evesham Colts under @ - @ 10s. He played at county level for Worcestershire, Leicestershire and Devon. When his family settled back in Devon he joined Twyford in the Football League. As a lad he went on to a scholarship to play in the Championship. His next senior year, while working as a player, saw him play for West Ham in the first tier of the English Football League (EEFL).\n\nIn the late 1990s we moved on from the EFL to League Two, where we played in the Championship. During our time in League Two, we also played for Birmingham and Coventry. That means we were in League Two for a good bit of the time before joining Watford.\n\nAfter that, we won our first place in the East Midlands FA Trophy in 1996. In those first seasons in the division, Watford won the East Midlands FA Trophy, a trophy which was the first FA Cup to be awarded to a club in the England\/Ireland Premier League. It was also the first league which would feature all 32 teams in the same cup.\n\nIn that year, with the exception of my own, I had not only won the first FA Cup, but also the FA Cup and Championship, but also the FA Ligue 1 (Ligue 1).\n\nWe went on to achieve many things which we wish we had done, including winning three FA Cups. Our final league season at EFL Stadium was wonderful. It was a fantastic one. With the exception of the last league season when we played for Norwich City, which fell apart as a result of relegation, at Elland Road we always played well.\n\nWhen the years passed without winners or losers in the Championship, I felt the frustration and disappointment of the fans. Not only was it their first season in the first tier, it was so many years to remember, and it was all because we played against a fantastic opposition.\n\nI cannot believe that the season ended without losing all 16 league matches for the first time in history, which is a great achievement.\n\nWe know very well what is likely to be a difficult period for football in football. So it is understandable that we were disappointed to disappoint at the end. Now we will have to focus on our new challenges which would give us new momentum and opportunity and we must concentrate on our new challenge of becoming the dominant football club in the league.\n\nWatford can and will come back and compete with our opponents to become the premier club in the National Football League and, hopefully, in a championship which can be regarded as the last Premier League team to be promoted. With Watford returning to league work, there is an excellent chance they will move in the top flight with the likes of City, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City, Manchester United, Burnley and Burnley. Although the season will be an enjoyable one as well, I am disappointed about the departure and wish the club an amazing year ahead of the season and beyond.\n\nWatford will continue to be well supported by the fans in order to keep winning these competitions. In the hope that they can continue growing and reach greater results.","token_len":655,"entropy":[7.6758,1.3427,3.3567,4.1426,7.2851,2.8315,6.9693,5.4662,0.5465,12.0199,6.0967,10.6649,11.1005,2.594,8.1612,5.619,2.9949,3.9419,3.4602,2.9754,9.3315,0.7077,1.9317,8.5652,0.1257,0.0001,0.0012,3.1832,6.607,0.4123,0.0,0.0001,1.3557,6.3107,1.6296,6.2831,3.8412,4.8893,4.8016,4.9831,0.6755,4.9211,2.0638,2.5727,7.2429,5.9912,0.3167,3.7751,2.11,6.4703,0.123,0.7791,5.0781,0.8308,5.2561,0.6158,3.2702,0.8309,0.1315,5.2908,6.1732,0.447,4.1504,1.6916,1.2985,3.6439,1.4769,3.3966,5.2407,7.2923,2.6022,2.8149,5.6664,3.6067,1.1445,0.2952,4.0504,2.5783,4.872,0.5821,2.2384,1.407,4.1315,0.8397,2.8288,0.4447,4.4474,3.6255,0.6627,0.8247,2.9257,2.509,0.0227,3.496,5.1502,0.0307,0.3506,2.4518,0.0237,3.0044,2.2604,5.5068,1.702,0.0322,5.7283,3.0335,3.2879,1.9132,2.3138,2.5492,0.2709,0.7035,3.8359,1.1214,1.4859,1.5154,1.5039,2.0729,2.2512,0.9942,2.3189,1.9283,4.4663,2.5614,1.0465,1.8903,1.1202,0.2258,1.5204,1.2214,3.4241,1.0774,1.3998,4.4114,2.9429,4.3945,0.0014,1.5046,5.1021,5.4723,0.8962,2.3111,2.9353,2.8621,0.9495,1.0568,1.6574,3.2782,4.047,0.4941,2.7306,1.6133,2.3565,2.8927,5.1119,0.0012,0.9421,1.2837,0.0001,3.6317,2.2241,1.059,0.8288,5.0434,3.3406,0.5537,7.1229,1.4496,0.5527,6.4369,1.2699,4.0653,6.4325,1.0984,2.6447,0.9899,2.6465,5.5253,3.8606,3.7926,3.7433,1.9287,5.8874,0.6933,3.7861,0.0009,1.2705,1.613,5.4765,0.193,0.9528,0.9074,2.2456,4.0023,2.0421,1.354,2.1262,3.8421,1.9661,3.9711,1.4577,2.3031,0.628,2.7323,0.7547,0.5113,1.4628,0.9528,0.8187,6.6803,3.1002,5.1346,3.0665,0.0344,0.5013,3.5069,0.5525,2.2341,0.4105,0.4817,3.9334,5.5162,5.6679,3.475,4.9229,5.4171,1.0828,1.2147,0.4163,4.1874,5.3762,1.1456,0.7123,0.0001,2.1473,5.0027,1.6252,0.6594,5.211,1.2774,3.4006,0.0024,6.3286,3.483,3.976,1.5854,2.889,3.3439,5.3979,1.8494,0.7261,4.4539,1.2932,0.1638,1.243,0.2489,0.6801,1.0815,1.3911,0.1618,3.2168,3.975,2.5202,2.4758,0.7412,0.9549,0.876,8.6202,0.1939,0.1589,4.125,1.8194,0.7772,0.8905,2.5306,1.4924,0.0001,2.8759,3.5331,0.911,0.0482,4.7115,4.0361,1.4076,3.5999,1.8595,5.3928,0.8952,0.3965,1.5487,3.3364,2.2892,1.9663,3.9436,0.8244,0.368,2.3528,4.3412,5.832,3.6031,2.6367,3.8306,3.2863,2.4993,3.7602,1.1092,5.3172,1.2935,2.4094,0.5543,1.5059,2.3648,5.8773,1.8944,5.2645,1.4732,3.2792,0.0048,1.556,3.3452,4.7165,1.5554,3.2007,0.5559,3.1696,2.8905,5.5131,1.8224,0.6134,4.2915,6.218,2.604,4.2086,0.7057,0.074,0.3028,0.9042,0.5235,5.6363,7.6328,0.046,0.0005,1.1896,4.8334,2.312,2.0434,0.6475,0.6919,0.0001,4.1384,2.8159,7.2034,1.7216,6.2624,7.1374,3.325,1.0984,2.5701,0.6849,2.0581,0.4829,2.5128,2.6273,3.3169,5.4629,2.3046,1.4624,1.1515,2.1827,1.9937,1.0267,5.0789,0.6317,1.7932,1.3889,6.4371,2.8857,2.4059,1.36,0.6491,6.9332,0.4032,0.8951,2.6695,0.1588,7.5271,4.6595,0.277,5.4315,6.5164,3.0277,2.3705,2.4037,0.688,4.4186,2.1743,2.2119,3.2902,4.1608,2.5259,4.359,4.777,0.6883,0.7641,0.0002,2.4168,5.361,3.8544,1.6722,2.8661,4.6432,2.6271,3.5391,4.2419,4.548,6.0882,3.2527,2.4617,3.7164,1.7859,1.4977,0.0256,1.0008,3.9294,1.9325,2.8737,1.619,1.6748,3.0216,0.5088,0.6904,1.5465,0.0002,2.8157,6.0235,5.2979,0.83,1.9052,4.3867,6.1769,0.0299,2.9136,2.2467,1.9654,3.6775,0.4046,5.8348,1.1153,5.9528,2.7951,5.8051,2.9544,0.637,4.5355,0.4479,1.5181,3.7853,1.8126,2.1503,5.9274,3.7972,1.2092,0.8586,1.6902,6.789,1.4479,3.3106,2.2027,0.3643,4.4225,0.2805,2.6861,4.4548,4.9433,4.9285,6.0319,4.2362,0.0703,4.7818,4.8528,1.9328,4.8873,4.2874,2.6788,3.3891,4.8504,0.1316,2.0659,2.0102,3.3836,2.9185,4.2437,1.4532,6.3818,2.0409,0.4745,0.3653,0.5441,3.7393,0.3565,0.2356,0.0001,5.4232,0.2542,0.0005,5.3383,4.5606,0.6127,5.4238,1.3889,3.069,3.2455,2.3106,3.3917,4.2514,3.6109,2.0956,0.3725,4.8862,1.1577,0.1263,0.3672,8.2483,2.0578,0.0079,2.9072,4.4079,2.9123,0.0888,3.3813,4.0014,6.2874,4.642,3.5875,1.1522,7.3836,0.1587,0.8391,3.8515,6.0333,0.0069,4.5153,1.6313,2.5322,3.9412,1.2235,5.1573,5.4828,0.002,6.05,0.3755,5.3031,8.1728,1.2084,3.8049,0.8367,3.4554,4.0011,0.2786,2.4755,0.6384,5.4849,4.0153,0.5637,4.3993,1.4745,4.2529,1.8364,4.9847,0.0007,4.8389,0.6437,3.5823,1.6205,0.0009,1.1728,2.9046,0.7599,0.8748,3.1188,0.1142,0.9115,4.9634,0.0006,0.7183,5.1025,0.0164,1.1663,7.2877,2.5915,4.3761,2.3386,1.2754,4.552,4.5051,0.063,4.5562,2.5671,0.4245,2.0324,1.9133,5.8419,5.1952,0.7206,5.8121,3.75,5.2064,1.9081,0.7674,5.4867,3.4885,3.0043,1.1725,3.6701,3.2583,1.0828,3.2226,3.9824,0.0805,0.2935,0.0002,3.0234,0.0288,0.0006,2.6102,2.8818,0.2007,2.0717,6.6317,2.9512,0.4221,1.1857,1.4763,3.0682,5.5624,0.05,3.9234,3.5915,5.5585,1.4317,0.764,3.8548,1.4366,5.8252,0.5382,1.7558,1.3554,2.0299,6.2773,1.1217,5.5528,5.9336,6.049,2.7733]}
{"id":790,"ended":false,"length":566,"text":"The earliest known evidence of a human presence in what is now Oldham is attested by the discovery of Neolithic flint arrow @ - @ heads and workings found at Werneth and < unk > wv [ +] at Neolithic site.\n\nThe presence of arrows in the modern history of Omsh, and especially the present day, of human-made, animal products is well documented. However, there are no known methods of indicating the origin of the earliest extant human presence on the planet.\n\nPursuing an explanation for these human-made early findings, the researchers investigated the evolution of and use of arrows, including traces of human skin, and how they were distributed amongst humans and other animals (i.e._ the use of arrows as weapons), and were also drawn to the early archaeological record to assist in the discovery of the bones of modern human-made animal products.\n\nBased on a set of samples which were collected between October 2009 and August 2011, an archeological assessment and hypothesis model was adopted to assess both the origin of the arrow and its use in human products.\n\nThe results show that the existence of modern human-made, or human-made products was first detected and further analysed in the form of tools (eg. axes, molds, and tools which were collected between 1900 and 1900), which were used as weapons, or as defensive weapons.\n\nDuring this period, the evidence for human-made product products was limited to those which were found in human bodies and bodies of animals and insects, and this could be explained only by the use of arrow bones and tools to make the products (eg. axes, molds, and tools which were collected between 1900 and 1900), in order to reconstruct the production of human-made products.\n\nThis

they were distributed amongst humans and other animals.\n\nUsing information gathered by the Archeological Museum at Great Ormond Street in London, and detailed reports of the construction of an underground underground cave system at Werneth, they were able to understand why human-made products were being produced there, which suggests that the origins and distribution of human-made products are still very much a mystery.\n\nThe evidence for the origin of human-made products appears to be limited to those which were found in human bodies and bodies of animals and insects (eg. axes, molds,

{"id":3575,"ended":true,"length":531,"text":"Rameswaram is significant for many Hindus as a pilgrimage to Varanasi is considered to be incomplete without a pilgrimage to Rameswaram. The town along with the Ramanathaswamy temple is one of the holiest Hindu shrines in the country, having its sacred Ramanathaswamy temple and its huge statue atop the Rammaswamy temple. Today, VHP-controlled state, the largest in India, is striving to revive the pilgrimage-run temple with the Rammaswamy temple. The temple has a huge statue of Maharishi Ram, whose marriage to Anna Devi set the stage for the pilgrimage to be revived on the auspicious day of VHP President Rajiv Gandhi's birth anniversary.\nAs part of the historic Ramanathaswamy festival, there will be a series of celebrations in the town. The Rameswaram temple will be one of the key pillars of Hinduism in Tiruvallur district. \"An ancient village in Tiruvallur district is in the midst of a rich and rich rich history. At this sacred spot, there would be a series of grand events. I would like to commemorate that day with a long walk through the historic Ramanathaswamy temple, which I will be taking to Tiruvallur, tomorrow, as a remembrance\".\nOn April 9, the celebrations were started by the Rameswaram Collector Rameswaram. He also invited villagers to visit the temple. At the peak of the festival, a grand procession will gather around the Rameswaram temple and it will be followed by five sets of songs to be sung. A total of seven songs will be performed at that time. \"As we celebrate the national Ramanathaswamy festival in Tiruvallur district, I will introduce the song song. This will be sung at the village headquarter at Rammaswamy temple\". The first set of songs will be sung by the villagers around 5pm each day. \"I believe, 'Jeebudu' (The Most Holy Father) will be sung at the village headquarter along with the other songs of the Rammaswamy temple. It is hoped that this celebration in the town will attract many tourists to Tiruvallur District\".\n\"The celebrations will be a huge celebration for Tiruvallur and it would be worthwhile for us to visit the sacred Rameswaram temple. This festival will be a significant part of our VHP's effort, because Tiruvallur is our heartland and the Rammaswamy temple is our very soul\", said Tiruvallur Collector Pramod Chhetri.\nOn Wednesday, Tiruvallur Collector Rajiv Kishore Chhetri invited the VHP district's members to spend the day celebrating the festival. On Thursday, the district Collector Vijay Mishra invited the villagers to share their joy by taking a bus to the temple with a set of singing Songs.\n\"In the last year, this day of celebration has been celebrated continuously and it is important to promote this festival,\" said Rajiv Mishra in order to keep the VHP in the heart of Tiruvallur district and reach out to the public towards these events.","token_len":660,"entropy":[9.6896,10.0287,2.9168,4.3259,9.9205,1.9821,3.5563,10.6944,2.9583,3.2893,7.464,2.5889,8.1119,0.0095,0.0011,2.9511,3.3358,1.5846,0.2539,11.7329,3.7403,2.1704,2.4847,0.5348,5.812,0.2338,0.0118,0.0052,0.4625,2.4031,6.1804,6.4654,0.9578,2.3198,5.2497,3.647,2.1814,4.2142,4.0361,0.1468,2.5025,1.6388,3.0885,0.0738,0.321,2.3363,4.7817,2.5172,0.0002,0.551,0.5929,1.2627,2.1615,4.3635,4.2114,4.2155,6.9032,1.8533,0.2501,0.3845,0.3691,0.0332,2.2595,3.6487,1.9335,6.42,3.8933,7.0415,0.868,4.024,7.281,0.168,0.277,1.1303,0.7305,6.8494,0.5047,5.8677,2.8685,3.726,4.8896,4.7897,5.2426,3.0649,4.8317,4.136,1.932,0.3146,1.6394,7.2354,0.2061,3.8475,0.8741,4.3818,5.3385,5.6385,3.1391,3.8766,1.6957,4.4759,2.5009,0.0333,0.0074,0.9288,1.5724,2.3143,3.2751,1.9348,2.7274,3.7096,2.0798,0.5592,5.3908,2.3504,3.4616,2.7664,4.1268,6.8659,0.6866,6.6932,3.6044,6.5007,1.7596,0.7285,0.0463,0.7559,4.2529,1.5544,5.0681,4.9221,4.9421,1.42,5.9801,0.165,1.1348,0.3985,2.6705,0.2601,5.4598,3.6604,0.6702,0.1079,0.4968,2.3497,2.3013,0.6551,1.2762,10.7155,3.2074,0.003,0.5827,5.2203,3.7547,1.4989,0.1221,0.0864,0.0117,0.0031,3.7652,0.4434,4.3531,2.2191,0.1069,0.7339,4.3191,0.0039,3.4077,2.3484,1.2145,2.4859,2.2882,1.4518,5.3956,0.0308,0.0255,0.0121,2.5589,1.1667,0.873,3.7131,0.1571,0.3677,5.8321,4.1392,0.3994,4.1054,1.7753,2.0995,7.715,1.957,0.2232,0.1094,2.0317,0.9828,5.3184,5.8502,3.5239,5.7505,2.6587,2.3026,0.0082,0.0065,0.0069,2.0987,2.1078,4.3975,1.3576,2.4018,0.0074,0.9982,6.1776,2.2483,3.1399,5.9115,1.6845,0.9648,4.8653,2.2894,4.3036,2.2694,0.4181,2.5664,5.1763,0.1487,1.0353,4.2511,0.002,5.9747,2.3612,1.9827,4.8463,2.4301,0.6547,0.0489,4.6012,3.5963,4.1208,1.5194,0.9308,4.9634,4.068,2.6386,0.4634,5.452,2.3971,0.1722,0.0442,0.0492,0.0029,0.0023,0.7879,2.6389,1.7699,3.9368,2.4142,2.0032,3.3309,1.7658,3.1002,0.0245,0.0024,0.0029,3.3204,5.3697,2.2677,3.6108,2.0899,5.8824,8.3207,0.8728,4.2061,4.1952,3.4272,0.2089,1.7626,6.1157,4.3032,3.7604,1.3204,1.405,3.3231,0.0423,0.0177,0.0055,8.0922,4.6144,0.7226,0.0819,0.195,4.3838,1.9579,3.9325,3.8469,5.7627,0.4876,2.1702,0.4628,1.5067,1.4112,4.7442,0.9394,6.8709,0.1884,0.3191,2.1682,0.2529,2.6859,6.0123,0.5306,3.6948,5.7281,2.2064,0.2884,3.0627,0.0037,0.0067,0.0036,0.5621,1.9034,3.9174,0.4065,0.8479,2.9354,0.0648,5.8988,6.7497,0.0036,6.1225,3.7485,2.0637,0.6829,1.8498,3.8056,4.5265,0.0281,4.3765,1.7966,0.7223,0.1039,2.2318,2.8038,5.3168,0.8081,0.4922,2.5481,4.3337,2.861,2.8832,0.9968,6.2823,4.1142,0.1316,0.1569,0.0676,0.0067,0.005,0.257,3.2988,0.5088,0.003,0.0016,0.0024,1.5112,0.178,1.6114,2.1305,5.3647,1.4004,3.5473,5.65,3.8474,3.1773,1.057,0.5302,1.7652,2.0844,0.8094,5.4471,4.3962,0.656,3.5398,4.8632,3.436,0.0775,0.0097,1.0131,5.4871,2.2978,4.1935,0.6164,0.187,0.197,0.4049,0.2296,1.1728,1.9575,1.4254,2.3236,5.2809,4.3962,1.7228,5.378,0.617,0.6152,1.9346,2.1254,5.4581,4.2145,6.5996,6.018,3.8348,4.9515,5.7331,2.8637,2.5088,1.8825,3.3156,6.3875,2.4303,6.7096,1.0132,1.1979,1.1715,1.2961,1.7282,0.6198,1.0264,0.1753,0.0062,5.419,0.0219,1.0434,3.2203,0.5646,2.4824,0.765,3.0439,1.0875,0.0039,0.0049,1.3723,0.9933,3.0764,1.4604,4.6987,0.2227,1.6497,6.1662,4.4981,1.6688,1.9618,0.4893,3.3705,2.8823,3.9192,2.1273,1.5692,0.0027,0.0022,0.0026,6.9532,1.6463,0.5484,3.7698,1.8235,4.2639,1.3256,1.1371,3.4328,4.1754,3.5831,1.5535,3.1228,0.0026,0.0021,0.0039,2.1327,3.1058,2.7688,0.2983,6.9714,1.4955,2.759,0.2391,4.1272,0.8358,4.1424,3.5946,0.007,0.007,0.0019,0.2393,1.4533,3.0648,4.6337,1.5849,1.0736,1.5472,4.9875,2.8139,0.0144,1.7579,6.1815,0.0514,2.2585,4.5723,4.626,3.8745,4.6853,0.0027,0.0021,0.0028,0.9414,5.0509,3.6723,0.1378,0.9934,2.6298,3.6544,0.3892,0.0029,0.0067,0.2232,0.5259,1.3386,5.2926,3.0073,2.778,0.9973,6.284,0.0189,0.0083,0.0169,3.7952,4.5734,3.182,0.1339,4.5215,5.0008,0.2267,0.4476,0.7303,3.265,4.9668,0.1473,4.8894,0.0114,0.0031,0.0085,3.1875,3.6313,0.8913,3.8656,3.4735,0.2479,6.6504,1.282,0.006,5.2336,1.4987,3.2289,0.0056,8.0669,4.6942,5.7254,0.3249,6.4639,1.5251,1.7122,4.7419,0.6073,2.0054,0.7459,4.1188,1.4925,0.1203,1.323,3.2758,6.1959,7.7466,0.1271,5.6345,0.0121,3.9408,0.9275,2.0806,0.2709,5.3969,1.0149,3.3249,3.636,3.2649,1.72,4.4921,0.7887,1.0955,2.5574,4.1724,2.1171,5.3434,0.031,5.0462,9.986,1.0458,1.4047,1.9103,3.8776,1.3607,3.0314,3.2543,0.4354,4.6933,5.624,2.1081,2.483,1.194,0.8938,2.5655,7.1786,2.8576,2.6087,0.8357,2.94,1.0182,6.0125,1.7934,2.3786,3.9353,0.5402,2.2675,0.012,2.8973,0.0005,3.4478,6.7105,0.0258,3.9246,0.5694,2.7919,0.0014,3.0634,1.4754,4.0209,0.2351,1.5816,0.0019,0.0033,0.0021,1.4547,2.6639,6.1706,0.8733,0.1134,0.689,5.5507,7.1211,5.046,2.8656,0.1254]}
{"id":3196,"ended":false,"length":628,"text":"Doug Van Pelt of HM Magazine stated that Christian metal had its `` heyday `` in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By 1987, there were more than a hundred Christian metal bands in the United States. As of 2001, there were nearly a dozen major Christian metal bands, including a large rock band, the Dead, who have appeared on various TV programmes, including Christian rock show The Rock Show (a Christian rock TV show), rock concert, and the Americana program The Rock Show. Christian metal records, however, did nothing to win over audiences, despite being one of the fastest growing genres on the radio. In 1992, Christian metal records became increasingly popular as a way to express Christian emotions in an emotionally charged form.\n\nThe Bible had two important arguments and was a major cultural success. The Bible was a popular genre for its secular lyrics, but was considered a controversial genre for its religiosity. The Bible also suffered due to the popularity of the music genre in Christianity. In the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s, Christian metal was very popular with the church. Christian metal bands were known to have a strong affinity with modern music because of their ability to play well on the radio. Christian metal bands also became popular in the 1950\u2019s as a cover band for the early albums of the Christian rock scene. Christian metal bands also featured a more secular sound than classical bands. In 1955, the first popular radio hit hit Christian Metal, with the title Christian Metal Mascot, was released by Columbia Records. In 1957, Christian Metal Mascot was added to Columbia Records' Soundcloud to allow the genre to be included on the Soundtrack album of the same name.\n\nChristian metal bands in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s were predominantly British musicians influenced by American singer-songwriter and punk band bands, many of whom were considered classic rock acts. These acts were popular in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s but also were quite popular with the mainstream audience. Christian metal bands also were influenced by pop singers such as Elvis Presley and the late Bob Dylan. Christian metal bands often featured music videos and music commercials in the movie. In the 1980\u2019s, Christian metal bands also experienced a comeback after the popularity of the movies. Christian metal bands even played in rock and metal festivals. Christian metal bands also participated in concerts and on television. Many rock and metal artists appeared at church services, and a religious concert was a common occurrence in which many musicians or other Christian metal bands sang songs for the Christian minister. Christian metal bands were also influenced by the use of Christian music in the military, which helped create the Christian military and political scene. In the United States, Christian music in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s often included the music of the famous musicians such as David Bowie, The Clash and the Beatles.

{"id":2805,"ended":false,"length":529,"text":"After her commissioning, Karlsruhe was assigned to overseas duties in the Caribbean, where she was to relieve the cruiser Dresden. She arrived in the area in July 1914, days before the Germans took control on the island of Dominica. She arrived a month into service on July 19, and started the attack, while being attacked by the Americans. It was captured, and she was sunk by the U.S. submarine  in an attack on the German forces off the island of Norfolk. Karlsruhe was wounded in the action, but survived and was awarded a medal.\n\nPost-war and post-traumatic stress disorder\nAfter leaving military service, Karlsruhe returned to civilian life. One year after her departure, she was promoted to Major and awarded the rank of Major. In 1917, Karlsruhe applied for a position at the U.S. Navy, which she was assigned to during the second world war. She was assigned to the submarine, which is now the U.S. Navy's most active fleet, which would include all ships.\n\nKarlsruhe was nominated by then-Army Secretary William J. E. White for post-war promotions, but she failed to receive the job and was replaced by Lt. Gen. L. Michael Thomas. Karlsruhe worked on naval projects since 1917 as well as defense and national security affairs, including the operations in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nIn April 1918, Karlsruhe retired and entered civilian life. Her commissioning was initially cancelled, and she was also transferred to the Mediterranean in October 1918.\n\nWorks\nKarlsruhe has been selected to be a visiting scholar by the Academy of Sciences of the United States of America and the British Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.\nShe has had over a dozen written articles made public in the U.S. and overseas, including essays written in the U.S. Congressional Record and articles written in the U.S. National Archives.\n\nIn addition to her naval service, Karlsruhe has authored numerous books, including:\n\n A Tale of Hope and Restlessness: The Life and the Death of Christ\u2019s Last Supper, with William R. Aarons, and Elizabeth H. Haggard. The Journalist: An Emancipation of the Heart, vol. i. 1965.\n Karlsruhe has authored and edited more than a dozen novels by Elizabeth Haggard which are available as paperback and Kindle editions.\n\nThe International Times of London presents \"Karlsruhe's Life and Death\", a selection entitled, \u201cKarlsruhe and the D.C.

{"id":4854,"ended":false,"length":620,"text":"Electrification of the Hastings Line was first considered by the SER as early as 1903. Lack of finance meant that no decision had been made by the time World War I broke out in 1940. A second decision was made by April 1941, after a month's service in the East Coast Railway, that the line would be electrified by the end of the summer of 1941.\n\nIn spite of the delay, the project was finally finished in May 1940. A number of local businesses remained silent on the plans, and the project was shelved until March 1942.\n\nThe SS Hastings Line was operated by the Hastings and Co-operative Railway for four years, between 1935 and 1943. The lines had been run from Hastings to London, but only had one tunnel on them.\n\nDuring the war, Hastings was used by the British Navy to ferry people out of various countries to find work. Most of the men were forced out due to the war and were sent back in order for the project to proceed.\n\nConstruction began in 1939, but there were reports that more than 100 ships remained stranded on the line during World War II.\n\nBy the summer of 1940, the only British vessels left to reach London were the Essex and the Essex line, with British vessels sailing from Bury St Edmunds to Newcastle. The Essex line was eventually restored as part of the Thames Line.\n\nIn July 1942, the Eastern Coast Line was completed at Liverpool, with the line having capacity for a total of 1,100 of the fleet. There were no service stations for many of the other ships.\n\nThe line was completely rebuilt in 1943 and 1944-45, then served by the East Coast Line from Bury St Edmunds to Liverpool by the British East Coast Line, and the British East Coast Line from Liverpool to Portsmouth by the British East Coast Line. The line was restored by the end of 1944, as part of the Thames Line rebuild.\n\nThe line, which began operating in February 1940, had an average length of 24 metres.\n\nIn June 1944 the East Coast Line was operational again. The line is now closed for four years. On 26 July 1944 the SS Hastings Line was completed on three lines, leaving at Port Harcourt, to Brighton, while the North Western Line was converted into the East Coast Line and operated by the British East Coast Line. On 4 August 1944 it was reopened to the public after a refurbishment.\n\nFollowing the closure of the London Line, which was to be made operational in July 1945, much of the Eastern Coast Line was still operating. The first phase of the East Coast Line was completed on 11 October 1945 for a total of 2,800 crew. Following the closure of the Bury St Edmunds (or the east coast), the entire east coast line was opened in January 1946, as part of the Thames Line extension.\n\nIn August 1953 the Thames line finally opened, the final section completed the line in July 1956.\n\nIn March 1964 the lines had their last operational run, with service resumed on July 15, 1964. The new line was operational in December 1964.

{"id":4185,"ended":false,"length":638,"text":"In 1909, Forbes Field's opening season, the Pirates beat the Detroit Tigers in the World Series. It would be the only meeting of eventual Hall of Famers Honus Wagner and Ty Cobb.\n\n\"As soon as I heard about the matchup, I knew I had to play it smart,\" he said. \"The fact that they had so many home runs, they had their offense built to be a lot of fun for us. Everybody at the time thought it might be the biggest loss in the league, and it did.\"\n\nIt would make sense for the Pirates and Braves, if they'd all play in one of the first World Series matchups in the history of baseball.\n\n\"We're going to try to pull that one out here in Philadelphia because the Atlanta Braves will have to win as many as possible,\" Braves GM Paul Munsgrove said at a news conference. \"What we're gonna do is go out there and try to win that game. Then the Braves go and play our games in Philadelphia, and I think our focus will be to go out there and find a way to get that extra win with a little bit of luck, or just having fun.\"\n\nAs usual, the Pirates won their first World Series, but were defeated in the third and fifth games of their series. They'd get hammered in the third in a five-inning game that would've been more costly because it would take away the chance for another major event in the series being played in one of Pittsburgh's major stadiums.\n\nMunsgrove didn't want to play the Pirates again, but felt the team was still at risk if both teams had a game.\n\n\"We were playing a World Series that was already scheduled to be played at the Dome in Pittsburgh,\" he said. \"There had been a reason for this, too.\"\n\nThe Pirates, who played a major role in what came to be known as \"the home run derby\" in late 1904, weren't going to win for the first time in 26 tries.\n\n\"We were playing a World Series in Miami, and their manager, Joe Bartlett, said, 'We've got one run out on three homers in two at bats,' and it was a pretty big deal,\" Pirates pitcher Mike Wahl said. \"So it would be nice to win the World Series.\"\n\nIt would also be a way for the Pirates to make their case to a major sponsor.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Pirates reached the World Series in four games, won eight in a row, and then came back and hit three more. They beat the Los Angeles Dodgers for the third time and then won six more times, ending the franchise that started in the 1930s. The Pittsburgh Pirates were the first team in the franchise's history to win two pennant championships and also the sixth team in the history of baseball to win every season.\n\nThey also were the

{"id":677,"ended":false,"length":617,"text":"The first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on December 7, 1995. It orbited the planet for over seven years, making 35 orbits per day \u2013 on the rarest of occasions.\n\nThe mission was one of the world\u2019s most important, and one of the first, efforts to test out the gravity of the planet through space. But it did not follow any traditional planetary sciences; the Galileo mission was not a mission for understanding climate change. It was merely an attempt at the very thing that NASA wanted to test out today, a spacecraft and instrument that could give a look at the planet\u2019s temperature.\n\nScientists are aware of the gravity effects of planetary systems that have had the opposite effect because the Earth is often frozen. With all those worlds moving around so fast you can see them and the gravity effects that occur can be really hard to observe. And the atmosphere is much more permeable to gravity than we would expect, and that is why most planets have an unusually large area of water around them. That\u2019s because there is so little water in the atmosphere that all the atmosphere, or water for that matter, goes back and forth between the worlds.\n\n\u201cThis is quite a big step in the right direction, certainly,\u201d says Andrew Ritchie, a professor of physics at the University of Queensland, Sydney.\n\nRitchie, who says there is a huge volume of water on the surface of Jupiter and its entire region, has been studying this effect for decades. He says he found out about it during his sophomore year at the University of Queensland in 2001, then a research student was named Tim Kravitz\u2013a science student at the University of Queensland. There, Ritchie found out that this was actually happening on some of Jupiter\u2019s many moons, but to no avail. \u201cI went to the Hubble Observatory and put on some photos and got nothing but the atmosphere. I found all of the water, and it was so frigid.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Rilei\u2019s team has been putting up a series of images. So far, they\u2019ve seen a lot of it. Over the course of the last few years, they have looked at the planet\u2019s interior and discovered that it has plenty of water on its surface. They were able to test this by measuring the level of water on Jupiter\u2019s moon Venus, which they compared with the water level of Mars. They\u2019ve compared in a similar manner to what scientists were able to do with Mars, by comparing the amount of water on Mars with the level of water on the Earth.\n\nAs Rilei says, this is the first spacecraft to test the gravity effect of the planet. Ritchie says that by now there would be a lot of knowledge of the gravity effect on the planet about the planet and what the planet could do. Rilei says he\u2019s had the pleasure of talking with a number of NASA officials already, including NASA\u2019s Mars exploration team.\n\n\u201cAnd the most important thing is, as the research has gone on for so long, the knowledge that\u2019s going on right now is really helpful.\u201d","token_len":669,"entropy":[5.3423,10.0313,1.0238,3.4802,3.3562,1.6473,1.6456,3.3889,6.359,0.0023,1.0987,0.7673,4.1357,1.5805,0.7573,1.0558,0.5061,2.0257,2.873,3.3242,0.1326,3.803,0.2744,2.0771,4.0383,0.0012,1.1883,0.674,2.0564,4.1975,3.5643,1.4207,1.2875,4.4879,7.9649,0.9653,4.5723,1.3489,6.0956,5.5583,4.0986,8.0215,4.2377,0.1958,1.1254,0.8742,0.855,0.0004,1.6329,3.5313,1.5818,4.0396,0.0332,0.774,5.7977,18.8639,7.7042,2.4726,0.911,3.2444,3.3972,1.289,2.8786,0.3739,0.1808,3.1758,3.5376,9.0524,0.3752,4.648,4.6018,1.0204,5.606,0.3664,1.4111,0.7972,5.1574,3.1796,0.6957,4.2675,1.852,3.599,0.374,5.6435,4.1094,5.615,4.2435,6.2014,4.7132,2.1026,3.1576,1.8647,1.2597,3.1904,2.1253,3.8004,2.757,7.2203,6.859,2.4775,0.8854,2.6261,0.5676,4.7748,1.8008,1.2658,2.8187,4.1423,4.6733,3.6984,0.5305,3.9854,3.2437,0.4938,3.2349,0.9486,6.8756,2.4728,3.2519,4.0768,6.0255,4.5467,1.0169,1.2365,4.9662,3.1549,5.2347,0.5675,0.8628,2.1443,5.474,0.1665,2.4343,5.1967,2.2636,0.2763,0.0003,4.598,2.948,5.6294,0.6966,0.8116,3.7061,4.658,0.2686,4.7427,1.7054,3.8265,2.5883,4.9074,4.1055,6.4769,0.6575,6.2582,2.614,2.5865,1.4356,5.4023,4.5117,2.0093,5.5788,4.9397,3.6128,5.9309,4.4698,0.7092,5.8293,1.3724,6.5257,1.3832,2.0614,2.0038,4.7052,3.2263,3.9307,4.4785,3.7947,3.3388,4.1112,1.1574,5.2153,1.6982,0.039,3.9533,0.5421,3.6589,2.5382,6.1726,1.859,4.0995,1.6221,4.6259,0.0105,1.2313,3.3569,0.809,3.0327,2.8318,1.8667,1.9383,2.7768,2.3577,2.1681,1.553,4.6849,3.0534,1.8566,4.1162,4.1163,2.7711,5.31,0.364,4.0368,3.8964,0.2251,0.4032,3.261,14.974,0.0935,0.2794,4.6283,2.9484,0.6954,1.9345,1.7462,0.8182,1.3052,0.3393,0.6754,1.6688,5.8192,0.955,4.6489,4.4465,4.3513,3.7927,7.0904,0.1728,0.0008,0.1053,4.1782,3.7017,3.4341,0.0886,1.6345,0.5661,6.0924,0.7024,0.9824,0.0002,2.4653,5.2932,5.8514,1.2039,6.275,1.0723,2.409,5.0532,1.7431,1.0967,0.3307,0.0008,1.2142,6.8342,1.5228,5.0094,7.4618,6.1788,4.8811,5.3891,3.81,0.2789,1.0036,2.6518,0.4361,2.4411,0.2704,0.9577,0.1965,0.0044,4.4714,1.6182,4.3951,0.571,1.3129,0.0002,4.2159,0.0401,2.6934,0.4447,6.3263,3.2603,1.0606,1.3394,3.5287,6.9036,0.0585,2.2672,2.0327,0.9494,0.582,0.0882,0.7831,2.522,3.5391,7.6747,5.6192,0.7387,2.2532,1.5052,1.3269,2.9131,4.3886,0.4668,2.9191,0.4471,1.4015,0.9386,3.2184,3.8611,3.5121,1.6643,1.061,3.3262,2.499,7.6805,0.0525,1.4542,0.8804,0.2764,0.0037,1.4856,1.4342,3.8406,1.3846,6.1741,3.5497,3.9892,2.5439,7.2283,5.46,6.5707,4.7325,5.8124,0.2326,6.145,2.7059,6.5237,1.554,1.3557,0.5573,0.7032,0.0165,1.6621,1.0239,5.051,1.7977,1.5506,0.0166,2.8234,0.7946,0.6817,4.4704,3.0772,3.7553,2.3343,2.2148,4.7852,0.5915,1.2501,4.8583,0.1558,0.0069,6.67,0.2213,1.3154,3.4257,5.8628,2.8037,0.4246,0.215,9.8315,0.4157,5.9584,3.9879,0.9142,1.1875,6.6295,6.6928,1.2089,5.6244,3.529,3.5658,5.8097,1.6115,4.6016,5.8832,2.9794,2.9742,4.8103,1.7828,2.2444,3.5799,6.0218,2.3993,0.9003,1.4431,2.6067,1.3244,2.1575,0.7426,3.4279,5.6859,0.0168,1.8145,5.176,4.2512,0.3627,0.0002,3.5939,2.0541,3.2534,0.1882,0.8475,15.9666,8.2122,4.5826,0.3429,0.3626,0.9372,3.5032,0.803,5.9199,3.53,2.1317,2.2645,0.003,2.9906,5.0548,5.8058,0.2032,0.642,1.1181,7.7915,0.5841,0.1416,3.0899,1.9625,2.9128,0.1897,4.183,0.8819,6.697,0.4731,1.9964,0.0009,1.4503,1.7248,1.5623,1.0374,0.4115,0.9831,0.3662,3.7999,0.4763,1.5885,3.6037,2.8639,0.0398,0.1329,4.8766,1.6617,4.0815,1.3628,1.4324,1.3183,5.6548,0.0428,0.5995,2.2243,0.8003,0.0281,0.5568,2.481,4.4775,0.8637,0.0066,4.6456,1.8867,2.4971,2.3221,0.739,5.275,0.042,1.0322,1.4588,2.8607,2.6181,0.0086,0.0088,2.8895,7.1226,1.335,1.3143,3.7327,6.1259,1.2928,0.9065,2.6404,4.069,2.1574,3.3493,0.7839,1.9709,4.3044,0.0345,0.0477,5.8483,7.1408,2.5924,2.6356,2.5519,0.9953,1.8348,4.5529,2.8857,1.6188,0.0076,1.9674,1.6409,3.5462,1.4492,4.0785,3.0643,0.6809,2.5855,0.0332,0.5136,1.0686,1.2125,1.3354,0.893,2.3564,0.2007,0.4738,0.3802,1.7846,2.6883,0.3127,0.6795,0.0002,4.8788,2.4799,0.3342,0.0025,2.3154,0.2256,2.2966,0.6478,2.0152,0.3641,3.3564,0.8053,5.1564,1.5848,2.089,2.7092,0.4976,1.6015,0.6864,1.1592,4.4973,1.932,0.6951,1.2557,5.0567,4.6438,2.6933,5.2221,0.4524,1.3203,0.3815,0.1718,6.2695,3.2402,1.1212,2.8272,1.9525,2.0279,0.9849,0.5162,6.9522,1.7987,3.3339,2.2923,3.5261,2.5399,2.6585,3.1992,1.0443,2.5303,4.3269,1.8832,0.0016,1.2091,2.542,3.5127,0.2059,0.7538,6.8234,2.7323,4.8897,0.1092,3.1676,0.8859,2.8702,1.8895,0.0011,3.0764,3.5338,7.0403,1.5378,1.0689,2.9171,7.2415,0.046,0.0375,5.0503,4.5311,1.7288,1.3945,0.8061,0.0002,1.1156,0.7218,3.3001,3.2136,3.8008,0.8162,1.1199,1.1799,2.6968,3.1537,2.6827,5.4927,3.3085,3.6826,0.0939,3.3698,1.7658,0.2394,0.2497,2.2257,4.7645,1.483,8.1504,0.9298,0.0213,2.7549,3.0594,3.721,0.008,0.5915,2.9746,5.1619,1.2186,1.7467,1.4131]}
{"id":3298,"ended":true,"length":604,"text":"Guns that fired explosive or incendiary shells were a major threat to wooden ships, and these weapons quickly became widespread after the introduction of 8 inch shell guns as part of the standard armament in the 17th century, when the US Army, British Militia and Royal Scots Guards were all aware of such weapons, and started shooting them at sea off their coast-lines, killing hundreds and leaving millions of innocent citizens dead \u2013 including the innocent sailors of the merchant ships that were shot down by the guns.\nIn response, the British, Italian, and French navy fought back to defend the island of Santorini and the coastal belt, while the French and Spanish navy and army quickly pursued the rebels. When the French and Spanish armies surrendered, the British soldiers had to turn their guns on the rebels to prevent them from launching their weapons.\nOn January 3, 1918, a shell hit a boat off the island of Nantes during a blockade effort. The cannon-armoured boats collided with an army boat, and several women and children were lost both on the boat and on the seafront in the town of Saint-Michel. On February 5, 1919, the French, Italians and Spanish navy launched a second attack and killed hundreds of the anti-gunmen, including hundreds of men and sailors belonging to the British Armed Forces. The shells went off in what was widely regarded as the worst attacks on the ships that were launched before the Second World War, at close to 150 miles north of Paris. In both attacks, hundreds of Americans perished and almost 20,000 French and Italian sailors were injured. On February 9, 1919, a shell at St-Pierre de-Neuvy-sainte-Anne in Le Havre in France killed four men and wounded over 100 others. A French Navy helicopter pilot was also killed in the attack and was succeeded by a British aircraft captain. On February 16, 1919, British officers sent hundreds of their troops to France to investigate suspected suicide bombings against the British. One British officer who was assassinated for the French was Captain Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Sainte-Anne.\nLater, in 1920, an explosion in Grenfell killed more than 600 people, including children, as well as 1,500 others. These numbers were far more than the British or Italian casualties caused at Great Britain\u2019s first warship. The attack came just two days after Grenfell, as a number of other attacks were launched and the British and Italian flags were flown down to mark the death anniversary of the victims and celebrate Grenfell. This year, on 13 March, the First World War marks the tenth anniversary of the Grenfell terrorist attack. With Grenfell taking place months before Remembrance Day, the first commemoration in May is expected to kick off with a tribute to those close to the victims and a commemoration of memorial sites marked by the police force.\nToday, Grenfell is remembered with a commemorative ceremony held in the City of London on 11 July. On 26 April a memorial to the victims was organised at Kensington Palace, but it was closed off due to the coronavirus pandemic.

{"id":1405,"ended":true,"length":584,"text":"In early 1994, Khoo was retrenched from KFC as a result of an ownership change, despite contributing to increased sales and profitability. He said : Months before leaving my office, I had met [Kloos] who I had never seen before and I had an idea, I had started my own company and I made a commitment to him (Kloos).\n\nIn 1995 Khoo returned to KFC for an annual Christmas visit. Khoo told me:\n\n\u201cIn 1995, Khoo, my co-founder and chief operating officer, agreed to sell me to another company.\n\nHe told me that I was making only $500 a year per year and had to give up all of my savings. I had to quit my job. Khoo told me to quit all my colleagues. I agreed to make it my job and to do this.\u201d Khoo further added: \u201cThe next summer we also opened a bank in Shanghai. We decided to do that and in 1994 KFC finally purchased our business and I started working. That\u2019s when I was very angry because I couldn\u2019t work for a full year and only started to work during the work week. So I was frustrated\u201d Khoo\n\nKhoo explained that his decision to leave was the result of numerous conflicts with colleagues in the restaurant industry. Khoo said :\n\n\u201cI felt that I couldn\u2019t do any business with KFC and therefore I left KFC and started my own company...\u201d He also explained: \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I could make much money and I felt like I could no longer be the co-founder or managing employee of KFC. So Khoo and I decided to continue.\n\nI was able to find some partners and soon we made many friends with some of them,\u201d Khoo said.\n\nKhoo also confirmed that KFC paid him more than 100 times less than his fellow employees. \u201cIn 1995 it was a huge mistake to leave KFC because I had no money to do anything else. Now we get paid a monthly budget in the same amount which was paid by me. Also, most of us are married to one another through the bank.\n\nNow we live in Shanghai and it would be nice if we were paid just an extra $100 a year. However, KFC always offers me a lot of money because they pay a lot of money for things [food]. My business income is a much bigger part of it in a way that KFC can.\u201d\n\nWhile Khoo is upset about being retrenched, he is happy. In an interview about the recent move, Khoo said:\n\n\u201cI was unhappy because I was going from work in a little village in China to China and the fact that they gave me less as an employee. I felt terrible that they should have given me an extra year\u201d\n\nThe new KFC leadership team are a mixture of \u2018reactionaries\u2019 and \u2018commencing change. In October 2014, they launched the KFC Asia Business Development Council (KAFAC) which is set up to develop new and diverse talent-driven businesses and to develop young restaurant leaders.","token_len":669,"entropy":[7.433,6.2672,0.2005,8.4682,5.0865,3.0171,9.894,1.825,1.0206,6.1351,5.9398,4.5624,1.3405,3.5026,0.0183,2.5313,8.2988,2.2575,2.1633,6.297,9.0883,1.3565,8.1226,2.5441,2.5052,3.9835,0.4239,2.2409,5.9173,10.3539,14.5534,1.8614,3.9931,8.4206,4.0971,0.7454,0.6953,2.4047,4.4347,6.7424,2.2903,7.3109,2.5287,0.5508,3.7841,4.1108,1.7245,2.9491,2.997,0.2456,1.9311,2.6326,1.7634,4.8345,1.5765,3.6599,2.4608,2.119,4.5268,3.6359,0.3929,1.1588,2.0183,1.2889,5.5851,1.4999,5.1806,0.382,1.9848,5.4402,0.8943,1.0846,0.0019,1.18,2.4927,0.0488,2.8978,2.8881,2.8949,0.0034,4.0124,0.3147,0.9638,0.0033,3.6724,3.2064,4.1992,5.1636,4.4374,1.1444,2.596,0.0014,2.9496,0.7318,2.719,1.5971,0.0002,11.3321,7.6952,4.2863,2.34,0.7756,2.887,0.0039,4.0428,3.447,4.0124,0.0428,0.5472,1.1379,3.177,1.3141,0.0124,0.4602,5.7871,0.2337,3.6838,3.2176,2.5717,4.2888,0.71,1.7112,2.9203,0.0002,3.1876,2.451,0.0881,1.348,3.0587,1.965,4.6518,6.0707,1.7888,3.6209,1.0217,1.2242,4.9733,1.5103,1.7057,4.0755,1.4006,3.6731,0.3194,2.273,1.486,0.3594,2.8659,1.0446,2.3289,2.5808,1.308,4.5782,1.0575,0.2545,2.1221,2.3905,0.0023,1.7729,0.0194,2.7834,3.3692,3.8073,1.5486,7.2675,1.3993,1.654,4.992,0.7351,4.4044,4.3575,1.733,3.7416,3.499,2.3303,3.4155,2.3779,2.9093,9.5096,7.7078,3.3944,0.0021,7.2115,4.9473,0.9319,2.5453,0.1751,3.2054,3.4122,5.7534,4.0546,5.7256,5.2168,0.9931,4.8484,1.971,6.6114,1.2409,2.0219,4.422,0.4158,3.3801,3.7524,2.1255,3.9666,4.9705,4.9253,0.0352,5.8309,6.2259,2.4639,2.9053,1.6238,3.4053,2.9921,3.017,4.0072,4.7837,15.626,7.6885,4.1981,1.2329,0.7116,2.7638,4.0736,4.0059,2.7001,0.8323,3.9235,2.2168,2.6165,0.0047,3.179,2.7343,2.1781,4.0927,0.9372,1.9379,4.9234,3.7564,1.9258,1.3323,4.7124,0.8693,6.6325,1.1596,0.5352,4.0981,1.0288,2.5762,5.9591,5.3983,5.9769,4.2192,0.0032,6.0428,0.0001,3.0754,0.0011,4.5549,0.9179,2.6935,2.9231,0.6819,1.7422,2.4909,3.9928,0.8067,0.0027,7.0268,4.068,1.7719,3.7992,3.4194,1.1123,4.0374,0.9403,0.7503,2.4625,0.0014,1.2113,3.1323,0.6774,0.0002,0.2518,0.3198,1.7728,4.0861,0.9862,1.5472,3.6869,0.1408,0.1659,0.0003,2.0904,3.1824,2.0625,2.1831,2.1403,0.0091,2.2689,4.2432,1.1893,2.5583,1.9048,0.0017,2.8262,2.0797,0.9346,0.0196,0.4259,6.9213,3.0508,0.6047,2.9443,2.2838,2.756,2.6679,0.5854,0.0735,1.3755,3.4661,0.1721,0.6147,0.0088,2.8138,2.0153,0.9289,1.2872,3.3827,5.0406,0.417,2.3452,1.4326,2.4204,2.0044,0.5693,2.0981,4.0767,0.0215,3.0873,3.1997,4.5477,0.0424,0.34,3.4705,4.1529,6.9165,0.7396,0.7709,0.003,0.564,2.9932,5.5282,0.0035,4.1222,0.3716,1.206,0.176,4.5948,5.2743,0.9468,0.0002,3.4854,2.2688,3.9059,0.0061,3.5377,3.2423,4.8977,1.7727,6.0879,2.8278,5.1869,5.6879,2.8596,3.9182,3.46,0.3746,2.9749,2.5186,6.9795,1.2677,1.4132,0.0021,1.4449,0.5289,0.9279,0.0002,2.5649,0.0011,2.5139,4.1699,0.3938,3.0415,0.03,4.6263,0.5834,4.7538,0.2626,4.6209,3.0904,3.9514,0.2544,1.9504,5.865,1.2891,0.7513,4.8634,0.5888,2.613,2.1476,5.3692,0.46,3.8412,4.1825,3.7521,1.4653,1.9501,1.233,0.0016,2.0603,2.4203,1.722,3.1523,2.4806,1.6728,3.4809,2.4076,1.9264,0.7315,5.3991,2.9971,5.5112,1.6327,2.9528,5.0733,6.0743,5.1292,1.8124,2.4757,1.2681,4.9561,2.2376,5.0675,1.3423,4.727,1.0646,6.0496,0.9012,5.683,0.2646,2.9589,2.0437,5.8697,3.2283,3.3563,2.4715,6.921,2.4763,4.9428,1.3985,1.0475,0.0002,5.9033,3.0778,4.4634,0.4448,3.399,1.1409,4.0026,5.2106,0.5828,2.5091,0.9757,1.1511,3.4119,5.2772,4.6142,5.7829,2.3014,1.8214,1.8142,1.2898,3.1284,1.0102,3.3004,0.3155,4.2232,0.0195,6.2513,4.7192,3.4343,1.5714,3.9731,0.2724,1.6049,3.6068,2.6926,3.0974,2.7485,0.3442,0.3938,1.6552,1.3311,4.8927,8.509,6.8253,1.8905,4.6486,4.6906,5.8007,0.8549,3.9552,6.0007,2.5249,3.2086,0.1323,2.5414,5.9595,4.5694,1.9346,1.2413,3.4379,0.0035,3.2187,5.1673,4.1902,0.3918,0.6044,0.0002,5.6093,1.4023,0.0013,2.6839,6.237,1.4458,4.1056,4.8181,0.0137,0.7666,0.8152,2.1644,3.0807,3.6266,3.4191,2.5826,0.0961,5.4502,1.7975,4.5797,5.0321,1.1048,0.7901,0.0018,0.5975,0.6209,0.1436,0.0001,0.1389,0.1597,1.2626,2.4685,4.6514,1.491,0.8313,1.6539,4.9318,4.0867,5.5002,3.6124,2.6772,4.958,5.0593,1.7727,1.7855,0.3833,6.024,2.0491,3.4429,5.0941,0.1218,3.7289,3.286,0.2733,4.3197,6.2476,2.9756,0.3196,1.6166,1.4208,2.2246,6.6601,3.0523,1.5367,4.8717,1.555,1.6005,0.116,3.6894,0.754,3.3397,4.592,0.6287,0.9675,0.0002,3.1443,4.5164,2.912,0.023,6.9365,3.047,3.8896,4.7514,4.6181,0.0092,13.878,5.5692,6.7186,4.7636,0.7137,3.2043,2.9024,0.8713,3.5903,0.1955,5.7226,3.4486,1.3169,7.6777,0.902,3.3462,5.21,3.7512,0.4292,3.544,4.4826,1.6194,2.6501,0.093,6.0393,4.4619,2.6609,4.2359,1.175,0.1664,6.5023,7.1291,1.0989,1.8347,1.6608,4.7421,0.6467,0.3861,2.5948,2.9224,3.3766,4.9817,4.7298,6.2892,1.244,1.6172,2.5591,3.0939,2.9812,5.7548,8.4857,3.1786,0.771]}
{"id":3354,"ended":true,"length":604,"text":"For several days, Nicole and its precursor disturbance brought great amounts of rainfall to much of Jamaica. A maximum total of 37 @. @ 42 inches ( 940 mm ) was recorded in the area on the 30th of April. The rain was much stronger than yesterday, so the water level has continued to decline while the water level was also kept below normal, so the weather will not be too bad now \u2013 though the rains will not please the people so much. The total rainfall for the period is around 38 1 oz, which is approximately 10% less than yesterday. The remaining rainfall is estimated to be around 5-10% less than last week\u2019s rainfall.\n\nFor the following table (below), the national rainfall by district from 6 April and 10 April 2018:\n\nCDPG rainfall by district : January to December\n\nTotal : 46 : 33.7\n\nAverage : 48.5\n\nRainfall : 48.0\n\nMaximum : 56.2\n\nRainfall % Change : 4.0\n\nNarrowing of rain bands has given rise to more rain bands, with a peak flow of 25\u201330% of the time for each band and a trough in the distance between 20\u2019s and 29 feet. Over the past 48 hours, the trough has developed into a dry and unstable part of the tropical atmosphere. When the trough is more stable and cooler at sea, the cyclone will drop off in its tracks and move up the track until it stops. This trough is not much larger than the trough of the previous year and is closer to the northern end of the track and therefore the area where the trough formed. There is no need to worry about the cyclone, so the cyclone will drop off in the trough where it left off at sunrise on Monday and then slowly move off again until it stops at dawn on Tuesday. These cycles are very closely monitored and are also very close. Rainfall is more accurate with the less nort of the track, which is closer to it now, meaning that it does not drop off until sunrise on Tuesday, and is likely to be much lower later in the week in the same track which may be partly overcast.\n\nThe cyclone is expected to move through the Caribbean, so any cyclone in the same area would be closer to the Caribbean than the east coast of the United States. It will not be a major concern except as an additional rainfall risk, but a storm that does not come to the southern United States after 9 a.m. EDT (13 a.m. MDT\/PT) is likely to develop on Monday. With such strong winds, cyclone speed is usually the most important indicator of cyclone strength.\n\nWhat kind of cyclone can be expected to hit the Caribbean during the coming days? If you have questions about the cyclone season, please contact our hurricane center online.\n\nOur local and national cyclone monitoring system uses forecast models which are built over the region, and are updated periodically. These models were developed over the past 24 months to keep weather details and information at hand. However, the forecasts that developed during our year round assessment were not always correct and are outdated now. This is why the system will update periodically and use the latest version of their forecast model.","token_len":670,"entropy":[6.878,2.4668,0.7046,9.4867,2.2184,9.0269,10.0189,15.2624,6.5016,6.7005,5.6679,0.0041,4.6118,1.1099,5.1567,0.0173,7.6861,1.1183,4.0503,8.0445,7.4535,0.2271,5.8629,12.6961,6.1196,6.2705,9.6006,1.8346,2.9578,9.4524,5.3152,0.7118,0.4276,1.9229,0.9618,1.8628,1.2734,2.028,2.8735,2.9589,4.9834,0.0778,0.6094,2.6014,0.85,1.6507,3.471,1.6328,4.4875,3.8384,0.7455,7.0046,1.6531,4.3812,1.5051,4.1586,1.3189,3.9013,4.7525,0.1158,3.1938,5.962,0.7355,3.1057,0.9209,3.3664,4.7088,6.3487,2.4019,2.3903,3.8909,3.61,1.307,6.0074,3.5613,3.0757,0.9961,3.6668,1.8763,5.2099,6.9864,3.7318,1.9943,4.7587,1.4675,2.706,8.3327,1.2692,3.1956,5.821,0.1941,0.6748,2.417,5.5206,0.7109,3.2859,0.7505,3.7968,3.3357,4.3979,5.4229,6.6136,6.9751,3.8251,1.5754,0.4898,5.2418,3.8804,2.5831,2.2441,0.1287,1.0305,0.7226,1.7877,5.4163,2.1049,1.2138,4.121,0.5113,0.2192,1.0939,3.6805,2.518,1.6284,0.7466,1.046,0.5394,2.9579,1.6745,12.5651,6.7294,7.1777,1.1816,0.7456,1.1437,0.094,4.9384,1.1979,4.9471,7.6895,4.7402,3.5742,0.8417,1.2563,6.9057,1.4677,5.2314,6.6014,4.3765,4.8906,2.8337,5.4826,3.7638,0.9528,4.5952,2.2423,0.1676,0.0002,5.0078,7.0741,4.8948,3.3194,1.7164,0.5354,6.5991,6.8562,1.9685,2.7253,2.2528,0.0003,5.4202,3.5486,4.1757,7.1931,4.9123,2.9931,2.7635,2.1642,0.0002,4.4275,0.7808,3.8891,1.586,2.2598,2.0589,0.0002,3.9885,0.052,2.0236,3.8905,0.6043,3.929,1.0989,0.0002,3.7269,1.2083,3.8683,0.4368,2.5007,0.5435,0.0002,2.6761,0.0566,3.669,7.1049,1.8669,3.9327,0.1819,2.8452,1.0677,0.0003,5.4474,3.9457,3.99,2.764,4.2335,6.4168,5.3051,5.7613,1.1203,0.0224,3.6421,3.8914,5.339,2.6706,2.7667,2.3063,4.7294,7.682,0.8499,4.4662,5.3812,1.3207,1.3523,1.4693,0.5703,5.1151,4.2475,4.5189,3.806,3.764,1.2139,2.0681,4.2318,0.5813,6.5094,2.9291,4.5014,9.2405,2.2021,3.0116,0.1909,6.1693,10.7438,1.0448,4.4019,0.7685,1.4305,5.3514,0.3012,0.4132,1.2692,4.0394,1.5618,5.5806,1.5146,0.4307,5.254,3.0704,5.8235,4.2414,0.093,0.1022,5.2516,5.809,1.1456,5.3249,0.8919,1.4233,1.6824,5.0637,4.1015,2.3314,4.8275,6.4413,5.6899,2.7141,1.1941,6.1484,0.6888,2.18,5.7243,2.7379,3.2775,4.0432,1.7358,1.2196,3.9898,3.7642,1.3323,5.1527,4.6703,0.3388,4.7098,1.0574,2.5507,6.8149,1.3804,3.7455,4.9329,2.405,0.1349,0.9828,3.7776,1.9812,1.2459,2.6881,2.7239,1.992,1.6768,5.5258,0.0856,0.4578,5.3591,1.9946,0.0774,0.183,5.2323,3.0034,4.8652,2.8731,5.1633,2.7807,0.82,2.1406,4.8341,1.4295,4.7636,0.8915,2.0121,4.3484,0.5436,2.3872,0.2906,1.3062,2.4716,0.0472,3.0747,4.74,2.0944,2.4683,0.0625,0.9155,4.5431,0.5429,1.9901,1.5943,4.7013,4.6688,0.2631,4.8055,0.3537,3.8243,6.7968,2.4901,3.8311,2.8681,3.1348,4.5122,1.3145,4.2636,1.8002,3.0575,0.3593,2.7294,2.0616,3.5592,0.4542,0.7523,0.4098,6.1221,4.8384,1.1457,2.9494,5.3523,4.4331,1.6509,2.4433,4.3675,2.4245,3.7412,4.7338,5.6627,0.4476,1.8139,4.5465,6.2211,3.8776,2.0044,6.4599,5.9532,13.9961,0.2057,0.9358,1.7353,2.4494,0.8879,2.8723,0.0616,6.3669,5.9231,1.9532,5.8955,0.9248,2.1279,3.1784,0.1121,3.0205,0.9113,3.8387,4.3054,1.0615,0.8902,2.498,2.2126,3.4404,4.3278,0.1835,2.7701,2.4416,3.032,3.7801,1.3877,0.0401,3.0927,4.7544,0.8557,3.1202,5.5469,5.4493,4.0032,1.3564,6.1277,4.1453,0.5816,0.8507,0.9332,0.0002,1.6767,2.1532,0.037,1.6507,3.0199,0.0147,3.1184,3.3921,0.7244,3.0446,3.1009,5.0722,4.9452,4.666,0.2295,3.0896,0.3794,4.8732,1.6013,3.0908,1.3294,7.0972,0.1827,0.4864,3.2518,0.7638,1.2098,5.3467,0.4462,0.7602,0.585,1.6344,0.0962,0.4754,3.0333,1.438,3.006,1.2986,2.5677,3.3401,5.9678,7.596,3.626,3.6287,4.996,6.3815,5.2414,2.2641,1.9067,4.0106,5.1937,2.9086,3.2516,0.305,3.7754,2.5049,1.0437,4.8054,4.0106,0.002,5.5191,5.4067,3.4134,0.0028,0.0007,0.1593,6.5872,2.0403,4.4684,2.6639,0.0022,0.0001,0.1087,6.3578,0.0026,5.813,4.705,0.4928,1.9805,1.578,0.172,4.8208,3.6202,2.268,1.5179,5.958,4.0782,3.1937,0.7631,0.9097,3.2933,1.439,5.8898,1.8369,4.3722,3.6431,2.3345,0.2687,3.0754,0.3605,2.693,0.2501,2.544,0.5642,1.287,0.0002,5.3696,5.3977,0.0039,2.1849,0.0479,3.2744,2.2573,1.8175,1.4702,3.4951,0.6564,1.5076,3.8229,0.5903,3.0983,0.8097,0.2515,4.9436,2.406,2.2615,5.347,0.4955,1.0641,1.9933,0.0213,6.0969,0.594,1.5785,0.9758,3.0396,3.2833,3.0159,6.6551,1.6675,0.8589,0.0002,6.2834,6.2288,4.0685,1.7431,3.2899,0.2518,4.9733,3.3844,4.1501,6.2984,2.4468,3.8214,1.3348,5.6492,5.3136,1.816,6.7553,2.2429,1.4959,2.6517,2.3733,3.6646,0.8546,2.6899,0.4232,5.1893,0.5789,3.8256,0.886,0.6116,3.6335,1.1393,1.7141,4.6968,4.5775,7.6707,2.3769,3.5426,4.3566,5.4503,0.6149,4.8262,0.0275,2.2061,3.1971,3.8549,6.9219,2.4922,3.9443,4.9338,5.6331,4.918,2.8367,1.3477,2.3387,3.046,1.9793,3.1017,7.4623,4.2868,0.2329,3.2135,1.57,1.5825,2.4618,3.4546,3.9654,3.3548,3.5757,2.1337,5.0897,1.7523,0.8751,5.1594,0.2069,6.047,2.107,1.7789,1.0091]}
{"id":2425,"ended":false,"length":625,"text":"By 1907, the West Virginia Legislature found the 1905 state flag design to be completely unfeasible due to the lettering on one side reading toward the staff, and the differing colors on each side.  When the legislature was considering a new law in 1900 that would require \"staff, including members of the public, to put a small number of their hand-made flags on their buildings\", it \"filed a complaint with the court of appeals\", and the court ruled that not only the \"staff\" design \"sought to avoid being confused with the insignia of our state government,\" but that if the flag could not be put on buildings it \"could fall into place as a flag of our government\".\n\nIn 1908, the Legislature ordered that there be a \"minimum 10 flags in each building on the state capitol building\".  However, in April 1913, the legislature \"ordered that the symbols be put on the capitol building\", and that there be a minimum of 10 flags on the capitol building.  It was later announced that the \"minimum 50 flags shall be placed inside all buildings\".  It was also announced that the \"maximum flag size shall be 10\".  The final date, July 13, 1913, was chosen to coincide with the National Flag Day, which drew crowds of thousands of people.\n\nFollowing World War I, as well as the US election of 1913, the constitution of 17 States was repealed.  On the same day, the Constitution was amended to require that one state flag \"be placed on a building...\".  In 1914, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled to allow the federal government to set the national flag rules (such as national monuments).\n\nSince 1918\u20131919, the US has allowed a flag design to take effect.  This was done in such ways as by incorporating a national flag design into the legislative process.  It was a major victory for the First Amendment rights of citizens.  However, the Supreme Court of the United States of America ruled against the state flag design in 1918, meaning that it would no longer allow federal rules that prohibited any state capitol building.\n\nOn September 26, 1920 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that states should have the right to change the design of federal monuments.  In fact, the Supreme Court was overruling the State capitol design design in 1916.  The Supreme Court of the United States of America ruled at the Court's first hearing that the design of monuments was an unconstitutional violation of the Second Amendment rights of citizens.  Thus, on January 2, 1921, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the design of federal monuments \"violates\" the Fifth Amendment. In the United States today, federal monuments are made up of the National Register of Historic Places, which the US Supreme Court of the United States declared unconstitutional under the First Amendment.  In 1920, the Supreme Court of United States dismissed the Court's case and ruled that federal monuments do not give \"federal and state monuments\" any protection.  As of 2018, the US has no federal monuments.\n\nSee also\nNational Flag Day\nNational Flag Day (1901) (or \"National Flag Day\")\nNational Flag Month\n\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\n National Flag Day (US)","token_len":670,"entropy":[12.4564,0.3485,1.5713,7.1816,3.1224,3.3823,6.9136,2.6707,11.1658,4.2671,5.8922,5.1512,2.3397,0.0802,7.9482,6.1668,5.9791,0.0014,3.8014,0.0232,1.0224,8.8818,0.5428,2.2776,5.1494,0.478,10.0833,13.4902,0.2714,11.8537,2.3044,1.4842,0.6023,10.7253,2.4858,0.9141,7.2903,0.1752,2.214,8.4951,11.811,0.8912,2.9418,4.2205,2.8376,1.9367,1.7404,3.7501,2.062,5.4153,3.183,0.6839,2.4224,5.8713,8.0969,4.5046,6.4843,3.65,0.1785,0.2804,1.8444,0.8411,0.3415,5.7359,2.6375,5.5863,3.2976,0.1559,4.5984,5.5631,1.8234,3.1137,1.6658,1.0171,2.1536,4.5026,4.4598,2.2611,6.2313,5.0263,2.129,0.7153,4.1108,0.9876,0.1808,6.015,2.4147,0.6363,4.1014,1.758,1.5364,3.3259,1.8621,0.6521,6.4297,0.5466,3.3369,3.4745,1.9527,2.4768,4.5052,3.8064,5.983,1.9215,0.5496,3.8647,4.7803,4.3479,0.2428,0.5176,6.9433,0.0192,0.7968,4.2502,1.0073,3.1173,3.0543,0.2588,1.4803,6.1324,0.8397,1.4363,4.8615,1.7986,0.1617,3.594,0.2385,3.5735,2.0954,2.3777,2.4083,6.1059,0.9982,5.7475,3.2957,0.7363,3.1841,0.9242,2.529,1.9434,1.4347,1.8742,0.114,2.1651,4.3481,0.3246,0.8102,4.2124,5.3985,1.9351,5.8656,0.5647,1.4468,2.2615,6.185,6.2699,4.6192,3.6105,1.6621,0.6998,3.5561,1.1821,3.1149,2.4914,0.0028,3.0252,2.663,1.5665,3.6233,0.13,2.0615,5.3524,3.201,0.3817,0.6885,2.4081,3.6384,4.6495,0.9273,1.2696,6.8134,1.5288,2.4978,0.5277,1.2156,1.7533,0.0007,0.2576,4.1526,0.6746,2.8096,3.4168,0.4442,1.62,1.5585,0.4415,1.7461,0.8326,1.2861,1.3407,0.8257,0.0001,0.071,0.674,0.513,4.1134,0.7916,2.8448,4.4107,0.1248,1.0497,2.8825,3.3206,5.8729,0.6979,4.202,0.3116,0.6466,6.0586,4.6803,1.953,3.0576,0.7931,3.7048,0.571,1.8327,1.3684,0.1809,1.0238,1.7942,4.1833,3.2138,1.687,1.6407,0.2011,2.8617,1.5096,0.8276,1.9544,5.1591,5.5747,5.3149,2.9642,3.3749,0.2507,0.7242,0.1629,0.437,4.4758,1.771,3.1849,0.0087,0.2965,5.1406,1.4493,0.1292,1.8438,1.4495,5.9354,4.2387,0.525,2.2804,1.4194,0.371,1.3557,0.9873,0.0002,5.4284,3.7006,0.0018,0.5728,0.1867,5.3959,3.0388,0.0133,1.065,5.4103,5.2813,0.5951,3.5743,0.3322,0.8884,6.3795,1.7519,5.4144,4.8021,1.6762,4.7456,1.5424,0.2457,4.9056,2.6627,3.0324,0.195,0.7518,1.0802,4.324,1.0323,1.9165,0.5751,3.5418,0.8962,6.0022,3.0603,3.1648,3.6807,2.2036,1.5405,0.6591,2.6171,1.2969,9.3476,2.8586,0.2236,2.2562,3.5646,0.1686,0.773,3.0318,0.0089,2.2357,0.2874,0.174,0.005,0.7619,5.529,3.1026,1.4399,4.0597,0.1399,0.249,4.2827,1.3218,1.794,0.1646,7.4999,4.0683,4.9382,0.0238,5.1274,5.7942,2.3062,2.2493,0.0002,5.6821,4.6536,9.8372,0.4032,2.3715,0.1435,0.8865,2.0863,1.5193,5.6408,3.1976,2.8289,2.7527,1.1857,5.2513,3.3555,1.5534,0.3499,3.1032,2.6565,1.8384,1.6506,7.6863,5.0763,0.6254,3.8182,5.403,1.6193,3.898,0.6988,3.0676,1.5618,1.1715,6.4998,1.307,1.7142,0.3892,3.4088,0.9375,3.6637,3.5008,3.1563,0.2544,0.938,3.8024,0.0804,1.947,0.169,1.9456,1.9173,0.613,3.2591,0.0201,1.6967,3.1253,0.0035,1.5512,0.0712,0.1051,0.0011,5.339,0.0045,1.1909,2.9638,1.2309,4.3928,0.5009,0.8658,1.1698,3.8604,1.1335,5.7913,0.1733,2.1444,1.9615,2.4376,0.0004,5.5049,4.4463,7.0193,3.2117,4.2747,4.702,1.5343,7.9469,0.0022,0.4302,1.6303,1.3772,0.0002,4.2654,2.8455,3.784,0.0981,3.7775,3.0173,1.8439,0.006,0.6705,0.0924,0.0303,0.0011,0.8244,0.7623,3.8931,3.3018,2.0049,0.4879,0.4514,0.0512,3.6567,1.0213,2.7381,0.1403,3.9906,3.2626,1.0289,0.1453,2.3105,5.0928,0.045,0.8569,0.9179,0.0019,4.519,4.4394,4.0654,0.7313,4.3218,6.6657,0.0002,2.5205,5.5112,1.1872,5.6733,1.0475,0.3301,1.6495,1.1551,0.0026,2.5259,0.0735,0.0244,0.0011,1.7241,0.0085,1.6043,6.0169,0.3885,6.058,2.0972,4.35,1.2084,0.5593,1.0589,3.2059,1.1422,4.8442,1.6614,3.9697,1.0866,3.1447,0.1007,0.199,3.478,0.0356,2.5513,0.1467,0.9432,0.4091,0.3047,5.033,0.1833,3.4012,2.5566,3.3631,0.0329,1.561,0.2594,0.4371,0.6005,0.002,0.4359,0.0204,0.0083,0.0009,1.1954,0.4262,1.0414,2.5803,0.138,2.076,0.2659,3.8855,3.6191,0.7561,2.0393,0.2671,5.3691,0.1754,2.2661,4.8189,2.8955,3.2488,0.0049,4.1965,0.0646,3.7376,1.0039,0.7164,5.099,0.9818,0.1423,3.1831,4.2817,3.998,0.1353,0.0291,0.0006,0.972,1.885,4.2809,2.763,2.0838,0.0058,2.6105,0.1936,0.1301,0.0009,5.2408,0.4681,3.8458,0.4936,1.3629,0.0817,0.5802,1.4648,2.6147,3.9174,0.1674,0.583,1.0093,0.0025,0.783,6.6314,0.0013,7.4158,0.5833,5.9701,0.1256,3.0906,2.646,2.217,0.2921,3.4783,0.5471,4.0173,0.0823,5.4976,3.9378,6.3974,0.2935,5.3025,0.3985,6.8502,3.5476,2.5105,3.4074,0.8107,0.6811,4.3646,1.6286,4.861,0.0726,0.8802,2.0019,3.588,2.1814,1.6963,0.5805,1.1408,0.4139,0.0002,5.645,0.5729,1.8521,24.0244,1.2398,0.3653,1.5487,23.772,0.7416,0.0531,2.9314,2.4089,5.4806,0.957,3.8542,6.0066,2.6151,0.7806,0.3041,0.0582,0.5856,1.9673,23.7625,0.5138,4.9448,1.368,0.0036,8.2164,0.7689,0.0011,7.8332,0.0145,0.7413,0.0006,2.8422,4.8911,21.2165,1.1505,0.286,1.8641,4.3067,1.0314]}

{"id":4857,"ended":true,"length":616,"text":"On 28 October 1983, it was announced that the Hastings Line was to be electrified. Reasons that decided the issue included a commitment by British Rail to eliminate asbestos from all stock in the line \u2013 on the request of the US Government, British Rail stated that they would remove all asbestos from all cars, trucks, buses, trains and cars by the time it was completely electrified \u2013 and the cost to the people involved was more than $4 billion.\n\nThe main obstacle to the proposed electrification was the refusal of the US Government to accept this plan.\n\nThe Government has repeatedly said that by the time of completion of the electrification programme, all car parts would be electrified \u2013 which was a long time coming.\n\nUS officials say that there are only a handful of companies on the line to produce asbestos removal vehicles \u2013 one in every 50 vehicles, according to industry groups. Most of the company workers are contractors.\n\nAccording to the report, in order for the project to proceed, British Rail would have to replace all car parts with electrible steel. That\u2019s because there is no need for the vehicle manufacturer to replace all steel, or car parts only if they want to be electrified.\n\nThe report\u2019s authors have described the proposed method as one where car parts are \u201cmade in factories in France and elsewhere\u201d.\n\nAccording to the report, the new method of reducing the amount of steel needed to remove asbestos is being developed by one of the German companies known as S\u00fcdler, but also by the Hungarian company Z\u00fcrich.\n\nWhile the Germans are not at all interested in replacing all cars with metal car parts, the Americans are certainly. In the beginning they were keen on replacing cars with metal parts.\n\nHowever, American manufacturers had already started to make this change following the decision to remove all the aluminum car parts from cars.\n\nGerman car makers have said that they cannot replace all the aluminum car parts with metal parts.\n\nIn addition, it now appears that the German car manufacturers are actively looking for alternative steel to replace all their cars.\n\nThe American Government has said that it will consider the matter on behalf of Americans if they wish to.\n\nUK government spokesperson Elizabeth May said:\n\n\"We have already said that we are not committed to the construction of an electricity-free power station. However, we have always considered this as an important, important and viable solution to the current crisis caused by the pandemic pandemic and any plans that are now being pursued by the European Commission will also involve making some progress in reducing the global supply of fossil fuels for the future.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, stated that the Government would support the British government\u2019s bid for electrification and he indicated it was time for politicians to \u201cstep up\u201d in response to the concerns of Americans.\n\nJohnson noted that this case was very timely because this was in the wake of revelations about Russian involvement in the Falklands conflict. The UK Government has already discussed the UK\u2019s current plan. In particular, he noted that the UK Government was able to address the issue of Russian involvement in the Falklands conflict and would be ready to support the Government if they called for an end to the conflict.","token_len":671,"entropy":[8.7777,2.7619,6.2564,0.3915,5.0244,0.3844,1.8034,0.1819,1.4757,11.8122,6.973,2.2852,0.9512,0.7132,5.146,0.0179,1.8472,12.3662,5.2448,9.0548,1.1834,4.584,4.3043,2.4779,6.4525,1.4614,5.4042,1.6531,0.4832,6.6287,9.0511,1.5788,3.354,8.965,3.1677,0.896,1.1883,4.9669,5.9116,1.6514,7.64,0.0325,1.1128,5.2784,2.7012,2.1547,4.8285,0.3161,6.4812,0.4711,2.4107,1.3002,4.9283,2.3605,0.5083,0.6281,2.2437,4.2285,2.499,2.4378,0.8688,2.2109,0.7342,1.7407,0.743,4.2092,4.744,1.6991,4.596,2.1969,0.8807,5.5421,2.3044,0.0093,3.4605,1.3084,2.715,4.9248,1.968,1.1409,6.0502,3.9907,1.2756,4.7795,0.0509,1.9422,3.6701,1.067,0.3629,1.0449,0.0037,1.6961,5.5236,4.9176,0.481,0.9448,5.2256,0.6007,0.015,1.087,0.8967,5.651,0.2954,0.8339,1.6365,0.2699,0.2637,2.9434,3.7833,4.7547,0.8611,2.2795,0.0002,1.5439,4.3068,4.7549,3.5422,2.6483,0.2853,6.821,2.0916,0.2803,2.3615,3.6184,0.4862,0.2072,1.6514,0.0233,4.7873,1.048,2.8136,4.4265,3.7598,1.6309,0.4412,3.7689,0.0143,2.8133,3.4744,2.523,2.5222,3.8059,0.7683,1.5593,0.6528,1.1437,0.0002,5.9597,3.4309,4.1929,0.494,3.6533,1.8804,3.7962,1.6924,1.8627,0.0258,2.8531,4.7163,0.2981,2.7555,4.5559,3.9209,4.8933,6.5334,4.7741,2.3333,4.1914,3.2769,3.4462,3.3284,2.389,2.7407,4.0103,0.0014,5.0974,3.9792,0.5641,5.7322,0.6092,0.8112,3.8193,4.4786,1.0531,4.0754,1.6936,0.5699,0.0002,4.5793,0.0042,1.246,4.0695,0.7663,3.6299,3.2384,2.416,0.7348,4.0452,0.0321,1.8701,0.7165,4.5226,0.0344,1.3679,0.693,0.0904,4.4575,1.44,4.1322,0.1059,1.2246,8.5681,14.3719,4.784,1.7795,4.2809,20.2964,8.2552,3.8529,5.4632,3.2626,1.2865,0.7891,4.9681,0.5492,1.8277,5.8209,4.893,0.2666,2.6593,1.7015,4.9928,2.9514,3.4239,6.9344,0.3119,6.3837,3.4028,1.4469,5.5768,0.1591,2.7228,3.6173,0.1801,0.3986,0.354,0.0003,1.5796,1.8315,6.9416,0.9075,1.5383,4.3462,4.2324,4.0065,0.9144,4.9543,5.2755,0.9581,4.7184,3.9409,4.698,0.1152,0.8688,14.3334,3.7784,6.8474,2.8358,4.9348,2.5312,5.0298,1.5557,5.0166,2.5057,6.9854,3.0455,1.0192,0.0003,4.0044,0.0042,0.5938,0.7569,0.3855,1.3435,5.1966,2.1763,2.6623,4.9191,1.0786,2.2561,0.0143,3.75,2.4367,0.8632,2.0372,0.5259,2.2262,5.2337,1.7075,0.9574,4.9202,0.5569,0.2756,5.0983,2.16,4.7865,0.1143,4.7577,3.2964,1.7597,4.5402,2.9705,3.8967,3.7246,0.3733,2.0748,6.9532,0.6519,4.6446,5.0251,0.4364,0.8466,0.4247,0.0003,5.0621,1.1874,4.3467,1.4559,2.4486,5.2529,0.8406,1.8065,0.0287,3.9572,1.7877,2.6409,1.2675,5.1584,4.3653,0.073,0.2879,1.5861,4.2456,0.8313,5.3031,2.5826,3.5927,2.3912,5.1392,3.1636,1.9557,4.5076,1.1048,1.8699,3.0435,0.3372,2.4038,2.0029,1.7905,0.9405,0.0003,2.7003,0.1185,6.3113,3.3891,4.3045,2.8486,2.2651,1.0066,2.9697,4.4318,3.5221,6.5307,0.6493,4.9259,1.4406,3.2384,1.5387,2.5669,5.4496,4.5155,0.0458,0.9302,2.2178,1.1963,0.7443,0.0003,5.498,1.6591,2.6702,2.2186,3.8794,0.2042,1.1907,4.0919,2.521,0.9403,1.7751,1.6396,1.1398,0.0084,1.2946,0.8499,1.3494,1.5975,0.8238,0.0002,2.6497,3.0092,0.3512,3.8818,6.4302,0.7875,0.082,1.0651,2.6707,1.3721,1.057,1.0637,5.8879,3.5363,0.9779,2.9039,6.9182,3.3429,0.7337,1.2448,3.1839,1.2727,0.6422,0.3893,0.0003,1.7937,3.2871,5.3518,1.1304,2.4544,0.1149,1.2601,1.6166,4.0272,1.8675,3.4951,3.1803,4.1404,0.001,6.1418,2.8442,2.0649,2.4669,0.0536,5.6751,0.3272,0.0003,6.8587,3.2271,4.3785,7.0902,4.6671,1.1347,0.9476,0.7601,0.0001,0.5511,1.779,1.9631,3.385,3.6347,0.5023,1.0362,1.6657,2.2468,5.533,0.0253,1.8482,4.3108,0.0868,2.7863,6.075,2.0611,1.7968,2.348,1.6825,2.7132,3.5866,0.0957,0.9425,2.1206,4.246,4.2297,3.1088,2.2769,1.3492,1.2101,5.0705,2.4278,1.3421,5.5079,3.3254,1.1956,1.3022,3.5473,3.3365,5.1248,0.0139,1.0628,10.4715,0.0474,7.7438,0.163,2.5684,5.4028,4.4471,2.3879,2.4089,4.4775,0.747,3.1842,2.1813,0.681,3.1339,2.204,3.748,4.1865,3.7773,5.6016,4.8111,2.8675,2.0222,2.7113,0.5886,5.5799,2.848,0.2801,4.0758,0.2911,3.5278,1.8215,2.4069,1.0646,0.1915,0.0002,1.7459,6.1625,0.0098,2.7375,4.2531,0.0005,0.2001,4.5227,1.2584,1.3847,2.2498,1.966,3.4829,0.8965,4.0181,2.029,5.6243,1.1825,2.5304,5.0595,1.0576,2.7282,0.0394,3.4515,3.8892,4.8646,5.0438,1.4716,2.9839,0.7332,5.4977,0.1898,9.2732,1.2449,8.1303,0.3683,3.659,6.7591,4.3435,4.6874,0.5499,0.4639,4.1776,1.0171,4.126,0.4388,0.1614,0.0002,3.9603,5.193,0.1885,4.4975,6.7348,1.7377,3.8319,5.7009,2.8287,4.5823,1.3584,5.2346,1.0408,3.5053,0.0019,6.3316,1.5888,6.0238,2.6195,0.0776,0.2355,8.1792,0.4401,2.6507,0.9472,3.1701,2.8676,1.3748,1.4345,2.5602,6.0142,1.3214,6.1387,8.0463,0.473,0.0262,5.5404,3.687,2.8747,4.9166,3.5575,0.1783,3.1853,3.048,0.2251,0.9963,1.6833,1.0825,2.259,5.6814,0.0399,5.5772,1.0864,2.4219,0.6252,4.8089,0.8329,0.5844,0.289,0.374,0.1883,1.6591,2.9093,4.017,2.0415,3.3877,0.1135,2.7577,1.3624,1.6487,2.2916,2.3434,7.1167,0.7162,1.9299,2.8768,0.0169,0.8814,2.3225,0.4521]}
{"id":1924,"ended":true,"length":612,"text":"The thumb spike is one of the best @ - @ known features of Iguanodon. Although it was originally placed on the animal's nose by Mantell, the complete Bernissart specimens allowed Dollo' to take on the entire body of Iguanodon a few inches wider. The thumb spike has since been added to the extinct Iguanodon profile on the's nose.\n\nIn spite of the large size of the thumb spike, the researchers had never previously seen such a long, powerful thumb spikes. It may help explain why the thumb spike is so powerful. At the time of my presentation, and Iguanodon paleontologic records were incomplete, only two Iguanodon specimens had been placed directly on the forearms of Iguanodon. In the future, they plan to change their studies to look for those Iguanodon specimens and examine a further pair of specimens with their new thumb spikes. And the researchers have successfully made a small dent in the thumb spike that is unlikely to be in any longer, and a large dent in the thumb spike. That said, Iguanodon is one of the greatest natural predators out there and, as such, is of huge relevance to Iguanodon hunting.\n\nThe thumb spike, as described earlier, is much larger than previously reported. The researchers think that since Iguanodon is such a massive animal, it will fit in perfectly with the proportions of the palm of Javanese palm trees. To this end, they want to examine whether the thumb spike will fit perfectly with the proportions of the palm trees.\n\n\"It was important to make sure that the thumb spike was balanced and balanced against the palm trees. We looked at the thumb spiked and found that the thumb spike would fit perfectly with the palm trees. It was not only significant but it also ensured that it does not fall to the ground. Moreover, it will fit in the palm trees perfectly. This was especially important,'said Professor Nunez of the University of Michigan, which was involved in this project.\n\nHe explained that due to the very large palm trees, the thumb spike fits quite comfortably with the palm trees. Because of the large size of the palm trees, it is ideal to measure what the thumb spike means for hunting. According to the researchers, the thumb spikes are not required for the hunting of Iguanodon but for Iguanodon hunters. In fact, they can be used to measure the distances between the palm trees and the thumb spikes.\n\n\"So that there is no more thumb spikes that can be observed. This is a fundamental advantage of the thumb spike. It may be useful to study how the thumb spike changes from different palm trees in various circumstances. We also need to determine if the fingers or the teeth move from palm trees to palm trees when hunting. And also the movements of the teeth are important as well,\" Professor Nunez noted.\n\nA major drawback of this thumb spike research is that it is only available in the ancient palm forests of Central Africa. However, the researchers are hopeful that the current study will bring even more data about the palm trees and its habits, as the research has been focusing on the palm trees themselves and their particular conditions. Therefore, they hope to explore this study further.","token_len":672,"entropy":[11.1765,9.2872,1.7223,4.4156,0.2047,0.4579,3.3553,11.942,9.6118,5.2518,9.1662,5.4275,0.6273,6.8048,7.7672,2.289,1.2705,1.3534,7.062,1.3848,3.1557,2.4498,7.3222,1.2032,0.9355,7.2834,1.4576,4.8549,4.2922,11.362,3.2769,1.7907,2.1131,9.6788,10.9908,8.4358,2.8407,8.7948,8.1199,6.385,10.1433,7.3521,2.6222,4.6895,3.6615,1.2133,5.3729,4.6555,0.9157,2.8314,0.0059,0.0011,0.001,6.5669,2.0012,3.3242,5.2618,1.0414,2.1561,3.3992,0.516,3.2602,4.0946,0.3327,3.469,0.2433,0.7954,7.1048,3.5291,0.0246,0.0026,0.007,7.2813,4.0343,1.2111,13.1715,4.2796,0.9109,1.665,0.1449,3.9913,5.1775,0.0145,1.3247,3.9216,1.4522,0.5756,0.5319,2.4351,0.1298,0.3375,1.4642,6.8631,4.6631,3.8084,2.757,2.0976,3.9103,0.4006,4.3215,2.1156,5.6295,3.6328,5.9763,1.3066,3.4046,3.9256,5.2533,1.1,0.4313,1.2034,3.138,0.4514,1.4833,0.8307,3.6513,0.9873,5.2462,1.6055,1.6635,0.8424,4.3344,5.7122,0.6376,6.9748,5.6557,4.3177,0.0014,0.0008,7.208,0.2139,8.4821,2.8505,4.6839,3.3849,0.974,4.488,2.9249,4.3618,0.0025,0.0159,0.0159,0.7126,1.6956,1.4941,5.6493,6.9972,0.7271,0.4596,6.7467,3.7717,0.6201,2.2802,0.0125,0.0031,0.0012,1.0585,3.3324,2.2694,4.2505,0.1449,3.4059,5.2655,0.0927,6.2619,2.1509,7.1835,0.9024,1.7495,1.2009,5.6048,3.9212,0.0016,0.0036,0.0029,0.6667,3.1793,4.4479,4.8485,3.3801,3.9221,0.5305,1.4389,3.6401,4.1146,4.4399,1.3354,0.7296,0.2735,5.5356,3.5201,2.4974,2.6766,6.1498,4.1087,1.7495,4.5734,0.8522,1.0866,0.6113,2.9502,0.5517,3.1587,2.2612,6.9233,0.0514,1.4897,4.1489,2.1997,6.8721,3.7062,2.867,3.9751,3.1295,0.8484,1.082,0.222,0.6959,0.0937,4.1183,4.6773,5.1191,0.0148,2.2472,0.1099,0.0016,0.0005,1.8237,2.9109,0.0277,0.3857,5.6581,5.9844,1.4111,5.8444,0.0856,1.7222,3.8203,2.0335,1.1794,0.0345,2.4963,5.4297,4.8452,5.2307,0.4992,4.2893,0.0087,0.0012,0.0022,5.2858,0.6496,0.6286,0.0003,2.5447,3.5045,0.1864,3.5963,2.7898,3.9316,4.4249,0.2758,0.9956,4.8885,1.1817,0.1735,4.3445,3.9496,0.7216,1.9395,2.1852,4.0003,1.063,5.5134,2.5923,0.0009,0.0013,0.0002,1.5873,4.4954,0.2649,3.2628,2.5812,0.2703,1.0883,2.5693,5.1068,1.9761,3.5027,0.8501,1.1503,5.8634,0.2663,1.185,5.0062,1.7051,9.7145,2.487,1.0552,1.2982,2.6946,0.7253,4.9859,3.5577,0.1786,0.0475,0.9368,4.9592,0.0882,3.9135,3.4768,1.0904,1.4246,0.1921,2.8258,1.9643,3.6077,0.4906,0.5604,1.0949,0.0983,0.7251,0.6269,2.548,1.3154,1.3435,0.0003,3.7664,3.0584,3.3919,4.0178,0.3583,3.8937,0.7797,0.7232,1.1168,1.8931,0.2996,1.2952,5.9995,2.2856,3.7696,2.2657,0.2472,1.3386,1.5268,2.1822,2.0195,4.9074,0.5299,1.0968,3.4593,6.8441,2.573,1.4221,0.3692,1.1868,2.104,0.3158,2.9988,1.3119,1.5332,0.6245,0.3283,1.0202,0.3489,1.6355,2.4761,1.9349,3.0996,3.3912,6.0683,2.5021,1.8444,2.6956,6.5058,0.2758,2.572,4.9518,0.0948,2.8372,3.4051,0.3306,1.2434,2.1531,6.065,0.0465,1.3599,3.9348,2.1866,1.9542,2.6902,0.3842,0.706,2.7454,1.6811,2.507,2.7402,4.6758,0.3497,13.8098,5.3592,4.7992,5.3077,6.2288,0.0683,2.933,0.4612,1.8829,0.0353,4.0132,1.7911,4.54,2.6328,1.625,0.115,2.0582,1.4743,0.7495,0.5842,0.0004,4.8605,3.3017,0.544,6.4426,0.0008,0.5203,5.1357,1.0779,3.5167,0.7425,0.7343,1.1279,1.6284,0.1324,4.9024,5.1917,2.4818,1.6477,0.2806,0.7499,0.2379,0.6063,4.8656,1.0603,1.4023,1.8813,1.1277,0.2029,0.2231,0.9328,0.1741,0.1395,1.9059,1.4543,5.5932,0.9715,4.0558,5.8675,1.4769,1.4373,0.2251,5.5909,2.0193,4.0612,0.9891,5.449,0.002,1.1377,1.1378,0.0659,1.3007,1.4079,3.4427,1.7741,3.4039,6.0579,1.0902,2.1531,3.2219,0.5167,1.5236,0.0019,0.0013,0.0012,2.9992,2.1826,5.7859,0.0271,0.0022,0.0051,4.642,1.2615,3.5288,1.2533,0.014,2.0406,4.5269,0.6278,0.4736,0.777,1.6668,0.8613,6.2083,1.0498,1.3432,2.025,0.1131,0.724,0.4914,1.8834,0.8794,0.56,0.6724,0.0003,1.7545,4.3374,3.9251,6.2987,0.5611,1.3561,3.8087,5.5197,0.9759,2.87,1.7917,0.8501,4.2714,4.1777,2.523,1.0503,1.7855,5.6475,4.9645,1.0099,1.318,1.4516,0.192,1.3034,1.1743,5.0938,1.5248,2.7019,1.4556,3.2656,2.8292,1.1622,1.2019,0.372,3.3409,2.8469,5.5633,3.7364,0.4367,3.066,5.2601,5.1479,0.9603,2.4854,3.3349,2.3657,0.0827,3.6412,1.3751,0.8136,6.4325,4.0102,1.497,4.6515,5.8067,3.4619,1.8303,1.3734,0.1907,3.0509,0.0408,3.4685,2.2598,1.347,4.0794,4.5741,3.9612,6.3638,0.282,0.2455,2.8167,2.451,1.4385,3.1457,1.1751,1.7229,3.4508,0.3747,0.0036,0.0012,4.25,0.0507,0.2842,0.0002,4.4879,4.2463,3.3799,0.5354,1.8083,6.8795,0.0561,3.1172,0.3216,0.3302,0.727,1.1818,3.1877,2.1803,1.6018,1.7029,8.9069,4.6048,2.6988,1.0766,3.5773,2.8919,0.546,2.7687,0.005,1.5404,0.7494,2.015,3.1228,0.1243,1.9012,5.8305,2.0573,0.4825,4.6856,5.8421,0.2469,3.6169,2.1609,0.9779,2.416,0.6519,1.6647,4.1073,5.6345,3.101,2.388,4.1646,3.8774,3.072,2.1027,8.0662,0.18,1.3215,1.9564,0.567,3.9488,3.0574,2.6475,5.9971,5.7418,0.3815,5.4988,0.0425,1.4604,1.884,0.6892,4.2829,3.2129,4.1825,1.227,1.2398]}
{"id":1221,"ended":true,"length":614,"text":"The series was given a budget of $ 100 million ( \u00a3 58 million ), the largest both HBO and the BBC had ever devoted to a series. The season was filmed between May 12 \u2013 19, 2016. The first four episodes of the season were released on the HBO Max website on January 22, 2017 while the second two episodes of season 4 were released later in the year. \"This show has a different message for us,\" said the BBC Chief Operating Officer. The BBC has said viewers are \"sick of the constant references to politics and the media\". They will see a significant drop in the use of foreign language during the first four episodes, said Mr Beresford.\n\n\"We've had our fans use the term 'frightening' because everything they know is a lie to their point of view. 'Frightening has become a bit of a buzzword'... 'Frightening' is the language they use to describe anything that people do or say... 'frightening' is the language they use to describe anything else that they are in any way involved with,\" he said. On February 5, 2017, the BBC revealed it had begun producing new episodes of \"Halloween\", a TV crime show filmed in the United States\n\nHalloween Season\n\n\"The second season is a bit quieter. It's really hard to get excited about this type of series as it's about a fictional city in the United States,\" he added. \"The first television series that aired after Halloween was quite a success... We'll see whether that continues to be the case.\" Since the first season had to be shot at locations in the US, a limited season was created by the BBC to give viewers access to the filming process of each episode and to take into account the geographical situation onscreen.\n\nThe first batch of episodes of \"Halloween\" was shot during January \u2013 February 2017. HBO Max had released the first season of the show, 'Halloween', in 2015. HBO Max said that the series was cancelled after a season-long delay.\n\n\"We know the value of being a British network and putting something local on air in the United States,\" said Mr Beresford. \"There's something that is happening in the UK and the United States that we would like to add to that, and we are very excited about that.\"\n\nThe first four episodes of \"Halloween\" were shot during February \u2013 March 2017.

{"id":1479,"ended":true,"length":601,"text":"The earliest research into thinking machines was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain is highly adaptable to new stimuli, such as stress, a kind of physical stimulus, that affects its development. It is thought that a small number of experimental studies are needed to identify specific brain targets through studies of the human nervous system.\n\nIn the next wave of research into non-invasive brain imaging, it was found that neural impulses, in particular, were activated very quickly into different kinds of signals, and that new brain imaging methods were being developed which were related to neural impulses.\n\nScientists had been working on this idea for the past 30 years, until now because the field of imaging only involved imaging images to see whether they could be processed in other words and signals at a much faster rate. By analyzing a sample of samples, they have developed more than 90 different methods which were then used by scientists to study brain activities, including memory, cognitive skills and attention.\n\nIn the future, these methods may be adapted to non-invasive brain imaging, which has had huge significance for the field of imaging. Research in cerebellar imaging (CSI) have been conducted to determine exactly which cells are active in the brain\n\nDr. D.L.P. Rajan, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry, who led CSI research, has been exploring the possibility that such imaging treatments can lead to similar brain activity\n\nDr. Rajan is also conducting a clinical trial with the Indian Institute of Microbiology, and he is also looking into a potential treatment by using brain signals.\n\n\"The research on brain imaging is a very exciting time for the field of neurosurgery. The current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for neural signals are based on an extensive range of techniques from molecular science to imaging and neurodegeneration. It has been well known that neural signals can be used to predict neurodegeneration, it now has to find a way to interpret the signal in a different way. This is an exciting time\"Dr. Rajan said. \"This article highlights numerous exciting potential applications of CSI as a brain imaging method, and the use of brain signals to predict neurodegeneration. These findings are critical as we look for an immediate solution of the long-standing problem with brain imaging \"Dr. Rajan told a news conference.\n\nAccording to a report in the Indian newspaper Express, Professor Rajan and his team of researchers have already created a computer model to study the behavior of human neural networks, which are responsible for most of life and death. In the new experiment they plan to use the model to detect the different types of neural signals they can detect. Dr. Rajan said \"Our model has been able to discriminate between a variety of brain pathways as well as several types of nerve-stimulating signals, which could be an important signal which would predict neurodegenerative disease \"\n\nAccording to Professor Rajan, the team also plans to develop new methods of targeting the neuronal activity, which can also be used for assessing neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's. This new methodology is also being used to develop treatment plans \"Dr. Rajan said.","token_len":673,"entropy":[9.605,6.7492,2.7592,11.1551,6.0122,1.4335,7.8703,0.094,2.1039,8.8225,0.5328,0.0082,2.8971,2.42,5.7875,5.9752,0.8896,0.7073,1.8136,6.1632,0.4064,1.9087,3.3879,0.0008,0.7798,3.051,0.2425,0.0002,0.6309,8.3066,1.4313,3.0545,7.3267,0.0185,7.2625,2.156,0.1642,2.0241,1.3956,1.7336,3.5631,3.0437,0.0997,0.316,3.8145,1.3929,1.0538,2.625,0.0023,5.2289,0.8857,4.9731,5.1752,0.0024,4.8433,2.5648,2.6764,2.6775,5.2247,2.2139,4.2364,0.6069,3.8933,1.6611,3.084,0.2048,3.4356,4.8253,1.4325,0.0175,7.5344,3.4013,4.3728,1.9435,0.1921,4.6792,4.5952,2.4079,7.137,6.619,5.1085,0.5988,1.6339,2.9985,3.4703,0.0093,0.5404,0.7513,0.0005,2.7937,1.6023,3.8685,7.156,0.1071,0.6869,4.1343,6.481,0.5617,2.097,0.034,1.2034,1.7914,0.5332,3.8039,3.0581,2.6977,0.0584,5.0184,5.6876,2.8432,4.199,0.9935,2.2568,2.7187,3.6398,6.8438,1.6081,8.3391,4.9224,5.2077,0.0069,4.5389,1.6455,2.3013,1.5873,6.8037,3.0164,5.8374,3.425,1.7462,3.2921,0.2976,4.3641,3.329,6.6453,0.0577,4.6705,2.6129,0.6078,1.4672,0.0002,5.3996,4.1024,2.0765,2.1945,0.6431,2.3104,3.1054,0.348,4.6247,0.4473,3.6845,0.0626,0.7246,4.7892,2.7851,5.0977,2.2617,3.9132,0.9878,4.179,7.5171,5.1626,5.1449,6.8371,5.4059,2.9308,4.2011,3.7482,2.0665,1.1867,3.9396,1.7617,4.8613,7.5859,4.9983,8.8173,5.4788,2.323,2.5124,2.4491,0.3154,0.5183,5.8482,4.0704,3.27,4.4101,0.1417,5.0552,1.9348,1.8656,5.3519,3.2973,5.3471,3.7398,4.1411,0.9728,2.6236,2.6644,4.053,3.241,1.3371,3.4325,2.5803,0.3876,2.5303,2.4186,5.2199,2.4498,2.2665,4.7172,0.6868,5.0962,4.2757,0.8238,3.89,0.3902,0.4656,0.0002,2.3843,1.4655,4.279,0.2275,3.1318,1.3113,2.4343,0.885,5.8963,0.461,5.9519,0.0195,0.0229,0.0075,0.6078,0.1567,1.6933,1.8695,3.1109,5.9023,5.0236,6.7661,1.176,1.6417,1.5558,0.8725,3.4009,1.1688,5.6681,2.2318,6.0535,0.4834,0.0662,3.8611,3.5508,4.0328,0.0439,0.2348,6.548,2.3279,3.9564,2.3068,3.0309,5.2249,2.079,4.5163,0.8174,3.144,0.998,0.9366,0.7586,7.5467,0.0002,4.9902,0.8819,5.1506,2.4003,4.3262,0.073,6.207,0.1141,6.8483,2.1988,0.6513,3.4063,1.4841,0.0405,2.0619,0.3643,0.6488,0.0014,6.5962,1.8629,4.1407,1.7612,10.3591,2.5297,0.9279,3.3262,1.5552,5.0655,0.9546,2.9409,1.7522,5.2036,3.0299,8.0214,2.6441,4.358,0.0156,5.163,2.7242,1.6529,6.5625,0.0002,2.0423,0.0268,1.2428,0.0033,2.2931,1.6354,5.7489,1.582,4.636,0.2964,3.315,2.2297,5.9236,1.3365,0.0726,6.8635,0.6235,2.0057,3.221,2.3026,0.9361,2.3304,3.2092,0.7554,3.3365,3.1627,1.7903,6.4403,2.1775,3.4152,4.28,3.4728,0.8108,0.0002,2.6543,2.3034,4.0493,2.9868,2.2671,2.5673,1.4015,3.2497,2.3143,1.7581,4.0016,1.2701,2.1553,0.2219,0.8822,1.7864,1.5782,0.0061,1.4465,2.2106,4.5466,7.0349,2.3771,1.3318,3.6504,1.8872,4.9871,4.5512,1.1313,2.9653,0.1132,4.5893,4.5518,3.432,0.0171,2.3807,5.0704,4.7332,7.3067,0.4829,3.504,2.1139,1.9841,4.2382,0.0005,1.0493,1.3753,2.9005,2.4715,0.8574,4.2192,2.1014,0.6686,2.911,0.8342,1.9233,0.7377,3.2731,0.6556,3.7347,5.1641,0.6222,0.0028,0.4461,1.4743,6.8329,6.054,3.0958,4.0695,5.6213,1.2364,0.7489,0.2035,4.5707,1.7189,2.6474,2.1155,1.6065,2.6575,0.069,1.467,2.0059,1.0705,2.7925,0.6828,0.4313,6.8287,6.8871,0.195,0.2605,0.003,0.9524,0.301,2.9335,2.2934,6.6542,4.7929,7.2695,4.5207,3.8937,1.4439,0.7827,8.0563,3.7393,0.5919,2.9963,1.0735,2.3454,1.8377,1.3155,2.924,4.0615,0.03,2.2155,0.34,1.3778,2.2046,3.1867,0.0396,0.0023,0.0505,2.0463,3.2807,3.4016,1.6257,4.7575,3.9075,1.9517,2.7945,2.8297,4.4547,5.7758,3.2412,3.6626,1.0585,5.1732,0.1921,0.6998,1.1306,4.9356,2.213,0.9757,7.3775,2.6516,0.0885,0.0748,0.0019,4.0114,5.5993,0.9968,0.1804,0.7001,0.3848,0.0002,4.8285,0.0042,3.4247,2.4577,1.1831,0.7954,3.3798,4.5431,5.0873,0.2943,6.1105,0.7009,0.0113,2.2503,0.4822,0.7881,3.3969,1.4765,1.3134,2.8557,4.456,0.5867,4.5365,0.9888,2.5633,2.7268,0.8561,4.5844,0.0848,3.4057,3.2175,2.2324,1.8308,1.3558,2.21,4.1665,0.0114,5.1707,0.4484,6.5112,4.1938,4.1014,0.8033,3.5293,1.2494,3.745,5.2338,2.8549,4.4182,0.0282,1.4631,1.9087,2.2977,0.1302,4.5999,2.0103,4.7891,1.1631,0.0095,1.4404,1.1519,5.2503,1.6502,0.8214,1.3303,4.5046,0.0543,0.0929,0.003,1.5258,4.715,4.0656,2.1714,3.2065,2.0145,2.4376,0.0039,5.3005,0.8721,3.3768,3.0521,0.0019,2.3621,5.4236,4.8389,0.2591,0.02,4.459,1.5211,0.0209,4.6701,4.496,5.0541,0.3434,1.6587,1.7012,1.4557,3.2254,1.2882,5.6769,0.5292,5.2447,4.804,3.5432,4.0855,3.8876,0.0201,0.0023,4.0341,2.0774,6.5619,2.151,0.0002,4.017,0.0037,4.215,0.1527,0.0051,0.307,1.2581,2.5272,3.147,1.5412,0.0368,2.5242,2.7548,2.0915,1.9992,4.9572,1.945,5.2439,3.2206,3.2093,1.1328,2.7449,3.0918,0.6465,0.4904,2.303,6.0507,3.8572,0.1934,0.0008,1.1785,0.784,1.5465,0.0023,3.8849,1.7184,1.0986,0.0175,0.7264,3.8159,3.6314,6.2936,2.3257,2.2294,2.4504,1.3965,0.6299,3.1692,5.1979,3.652,6.2538,1.0679,0.0046,0.0225,0.0015,0.4487,0.2553]}

{"id":3984,"ended":true,"length":631,"text":"The king vulture eats anything from cattle carcasses to beached fish and dead lizards. Principally a carrion eater, there are isolated reports of it killing and eating injured animals, newborn calves and young birds. When the king sees a child he will immediately eat that child and kill the child. It is known as a \u201ccaught fish feast feast\u201d, where the king is fed a large quantity of live meat (caused by a male) and the mother is not allowed to see the body for a few days. A caught whale eats everything and is eaten very slowly by birds like moles, and pelt and bison etc. There are also reports of it eating prawns and oysters (caused by a male that causes disease and also has a male that kills everything as well) as well as salmon. The king is very fond of the shellfish and oyster which are eaten by a lot of people.\n\nHe also feeds the live meat or fish on the carcasses that were in the carcass of a male which may have been washed off in the mud. He can eat the flesh or bones with a knife. The king eats or eats whole fish which have been killed and eaten by animals. In addition he eats the meat which have been frozen off and the animal\u2019s kidneys, heart and lungs are used as well. He also takes the carcass of an injured animal and eats it.\n\nOnce the food has been eaten the king will immediately eat it again and after a few days it will be gone. When the King of the White River takes away the animal carcass the animal can be left free from the King\u2019s presence by the King. The king will eat again and again and the King will eat and eat again the food which has been eaten by animals. When the King of White River takes away the dead animal carcass the carcass is left free from the King\u2019s presence. When the King of the White River takes away the dead animal carcass the carcass is left free from the King\u2019s presence by the King. He will eat again and again and the King will eat and eat the same. In addition he will eat the alive animal carcass of any dead animal or piece of meat which have been taken from animals so that it can be given back to the King.\nThere is a great deal of concern when it comes to the King at this level, and a lot of people seem to think it doesn\u2019t matter and he should stop getting himself into all those things in a way that can be seen as making some kind of difference. The King of the White River must end this thing and there should be peace about the whole thing. What has happened with the white river is that the King is leaving his mark on the life of the white river, by eating and eating the dead animal carcass of each of the dead carcasses. The whole white river should be freed from this kind of thing and he should put it back into his place.\n\nThe best way for the King to end the white river is by creating a peace deal with his enemies. The last thing that should be done before these agreements can be accomplished are the political and trade relations and the ties between the White River and the neighboring states.","token_len":675,"entropy":[9.0128,8.9123,4.8509,6.5522,6.329,4.2123,6.4841,6.1228,0.0014,0.2868,5.873,4.6502,3.4483,2.4247,7.0301,5.5196,0.151,0.9307,13.4982,0.0231,0.4485,4.0902,7.3045,3.7058,0.0041,7.8011,1.2191,5.9786,0.8883,9.5472,6.309,0.2854,4.9641,4.1392,3.7971,0.9197,8.2067,2.51,2.0761,10.0657,3.4801,1.0922,3.2786,3.7106,0.3826,5.4274,1.999,1.1411,5.8962,1.5321,5.3069,3.218,2.3856,4.1781,4.5315,3.4005,0.4424,1.8563,3.3943,1.9155,0.9173,1.2988,3.1224,0.5246,4.0664,1.9054,1.2824,12.7146,6.7704,5.7907,5.191,4.9079,6.7958,9.9038,1.1112,8.0816,3.2082,3.9415,0.9827,0.5241,2.5827,5.531,1.5309,2.3014,1.4844,0.0125,4.0228,3.6004,3.8494,6.8631,0.9772,0.119,2.2466,6.8183,3.4928,1.0379,2.6847,3.679,1.9459,4.0131,1.2595,0.0983,3.5134,0.6537,6.3117,3.1407,2.0477,1.8816,0.5087,0.5607,3.6678,8.2057,6.2161,3.2697,4.9574,3.817,1.8234,2.9241,5.4054,2.5077,2.4016,5.4472,4.954,4.9115,4.6814,1.6837,3.8496,6.3159,5.0146,3.7371,5.2104,2.2794,8.0625,0.2105,3.6052,0.5937,1.4088,0.904,0.2595,2.1242,1.1034,5.6481,2.2156,0.0639,1.0807,5.2749,0.0573,3.4958,3.1888,0.1931,0.0227,1.1971,0.5087,5.8576,6.6098,5.5435,2.5177,4.5935,4.0052,1.1471,6.0841,3.6277,1.9658,6.5142,5.5377,0.9966,1.8181,2.9287,0.1821,0.041,6.2601,1.5739,2.2495,0.8374,1.9515,3.7657,1.7054,0.0152,2.4687,7.5659,0.0731,1.257,4.8056,1.5658,2.9397,1.7356,2.0184,1.1937,3.854,2.7058,0.0458,1.65,1.023,1.6688,0.0168,5.8581,2.5807,4.6791,2.1374,6.291,3.4475,6.0071,2.2211,3.8355,1.945,4.1874,0.0888,4.0641,3.5487,5.0384,0.82,5.2854,1.2377,1.5102,1.6742,6.0277,4.3122,4.9706,2.2985,0.7462,5.8259,2.1095,3.2413,0.5883,5.4491,1.2009,2.6654,3.9754,2.5318,2.2327,3.0025,2.6208,2.3592,5.4513,2.1159,2.0522,2.1278,2.1294,0.7879,2.975,5.7947,1.7802,6.2708,2.3663,3.0723,2.7961,0.6521,3.3701,2.6734,1.4864,0.8338,3.1067,1.7455,3.7337,3.1306,2.0097,2.0232,2.1109,2.9448,3.4545,4.8899,0.308,5.4633,6.3792,2.1943,3.4487,5.6037,13.6657,7.4267,2.0168,6.754,1.8647,3.1724,1.1229,2.1733,2.9675,3.8691,1.7603,3.3562,1.1495,1.6355,1.5401,4.6002,1.7894,2.3913,1.3719,0.5232,3.2369,2.8012,0.6915,0.8508,2.0413,0.4939,1.6016,1.4269,0.0002,5.4651,0.9752,5.6306,1.3286,0.109,0.931,1.7065,0.2015,1.6792,3.9001,2.1249,1.2817,2.9429,1.2688,5.3266,1.7393,0.6648,0.17,2.7591,0.5183,1.2551,4.9548,0.4288,3.575,0.8351,4.9604,4.8425,1.569,6.8638,4.9363,4.6147,4.1918,0.6202,4.907,3.4501,0.3361,2.1687,4.2623,4.1761,0.3688,4.0343,6.3045,4.5846,0.5221,2.9828,4.7631,0.5711,0.3586,5.4462,4.989,2.3735,2.9249,3.3409,1.7116,2.0428,1.8037,2.686,6.7212,1.3803,2.6368,1.5982,2.7867,2.8586,0.9322,1.6346,3.2136,0.8381,1.335,4.2641,5.2576,2.4375,1.593,0.1647,0.6737,1.5521,2.513,0.5627,3.3722,0.4165,0.8383,1.1304,4.8771,0.0646,2.0476,0.3331,0.2291,3.958,1.7178,0.6979,0.0448,0.681,2.6596,0.0504,2.2433,1.7325,1.301,0.9812,0.1625,0.1733,0.6808,0.0044,0.0061,0.0227,1.3585,2.7548,0.2746,0.4884,0.2495,0.7534,0.5664,0.0054,0.8932,0.0722,0.3202,2.0206,1.0686,0.1906,0.0052,0.305,0.7227,0.0047,0.218,0.6003,0.1885,0.2251,0.0982,0.1235,0.2182,0.0009,0.0023,0.0227,2.9647,0.1398,0.2341,0.2619,3.4054,1.0417,0.838,1.6316,0.604,0.1787,0.5605,0.8495,0.1606,0.1086,0.0289,0.6079,0.0108,5.0759,4.1327,3.2729,4.0652,1.0991,1.2529,1.1917,0.5931,0.9137,7.0019,2.3393,0.7973,0.1726,1.7403,3.9579,2.114,0.4542,3.6304,7.3662,0.1143,2.186,1.5492,4.0748,0.2446,2.7738,1.0717,5.6351,5.7119,0.3976,1.5824,0.7982,0.137,4.1647,1.8781,0.2162,0.2715,0.2445,0.7602,1.0922,18.3131,1.4359,1.333,3.963,0.764,0.17,4.9436,4.0925,1.8203,0.0638,0.0028,1.1795,2.5409,6.4043,2.0112,6.7864,2.7756,2.3588,4.0825,1.0295,0.0987,1.2625,4.5148,0.1373,1.1672,3.0869,5.6067,6.167,0.7263,0.1229,0.513,4.6212,3.8918,3.1923,5.4107,6.129,6.7463,2.1107,5.8332,5.0554,2.9149,5.0781,3.6638,2.7189,0.7596,3.836,1.9135,2.9229,0.5389,5.1643,5.4965,1.9064,0.0011,3.1084,0.7922,2.5637,1.4828,1.6842,0.3338,0.0929,0.0105,5.9491,6.0985,2.1751,4.9033,2.0417,4.441,3.1704,0.1184,5.6836,7.3408,2.6634,1.8086,1.198,0.5605,5.6928,4.628,0.7778,3.2191,0.7198,5.0285,0.9501,1.0672,1.1695,1.3439,0.89,2.8081,5.7502,2.6731,3.7606,0.6102,0.6798,5.6146,0.461,0.7702,3.6999,0.4149,2.0178,5.3113,2.6331,2.3621,0.7376,2.0565,1.3355,1.8224,0.5159,0.6722,1.1231,5.8149,1.3321,0.5753,1.0317,5.1561,0.1879,1.4359,1.8569,4.2306,2.2844,0.0494,2.9068,0.5585,6.1002,0.9067,3.3568,4.2607,0.0005,2.3032,1.4577,3.7446,0.6889,5.0678,2.1506,0.5094,1.451,2.5087,3.1887,0.9226,1.0638,0.0003,1.8441,6.2662,1.0196,2.5679,0.7358,0.6209,0.6744,1.4198,1.788,1.6373,0.0589,0.3885,1.9221,5.1976,0.6037,4.464,6.2437,1.4111,3.1237,3.9566,1.0361,1.7068,5.3456,0.6926,2.1844,2.7855,0.9126,0.2175,4.0961,5.8023,3.8877,2.7844,0.2951,5.5756,4.1816,1.0998,5.4785,2.9594,5.9739,3.9584,3.9502,1.7862,6.95,0.8851,0.5607,2.8633,0.2535,0.2877,0.6066,5.9377,3.3421,0.3814]}
{"id":1387,"ended":false,"length":622,"text":"In 1863, ground was broke near Miller's Landing on the Missouri River for the First Transcontinental Railroad. Along with local financier Edward Creighton, George Francis Train was the promoter who was trying to get the railroad to open its first location, in a small rural community in Missouri, the river at the head of the Arkansas River.\nIt was on March 14, 1863, when an army of U.S. Army & Navy sailors stormed the railroad bridge above the Columbia River, killing 18 men and injuring more than 1,200 others, in St. Louis.\nThe bridge and the nearby Columbia River and the adjacent bridge, which opened in 1790, were used as a depot until the early stages of the Civil War.\nThe Union soldiers had to be rescued because the bridge was under fire. The crew was then evacuated to a town called Newcomb on the Missouri River \u2014 known as the \"town of a hundred and fifty\", in the 18th century.\nThe bridge was destroyed in the fall of 1861 and in 1776 burned down again. The Union soldiers then spent the next three years building the next railroad station, located where the railroad would stop for a few days.\nToday, the town and surrounding area has become a tourist destination with the National Park Service providing tours to visitors on a daily basis.\nDespite the devastating loss of the bridge in 1861, Governor Andrew Johnson signed the Railroad Bill of 1794 that allowed for repairs and the expansion of the railroad to more capacity than previously permitted.\n\"The Columbia River and Missouri Rivers are now being restored for many of the same attractions and activities that we served as children on historic trips that lasted from the beginning of a hundred years ago to the present day,\" said Johnson.\nThe current owner of the city of Columbia was the former owner of this area, the St. Louis-based John C. \"Joe\" Bredick.\nJoe Bredick sold the riverbed to the Missouri River and the Missouri River Bridge Company. From there Bredick continued his expansion of the Columbia River to include a new bridge along the river and the Missouri and Columbia rivers.\nDuring its construction, the river was flooded in the summer. In October 1861, three days before the bridge's opening, the Columbia River reached an over-capacity capacity of 2.1 times its capacity and was closed to vehicular traffic for an extended period of time.\nThe river had an immediate effect on the Missouri Department of Commerce, which operated a public transportation system which was open to passengers and businessmen except for those that owned a business in St. Louis County, Missouri. Over the next 30 years, however, the river saw a decrease in volume and speed. In the latter part of the 20th century, however, the river reached its top end in St. Louis County, where it was again closed to vehicular traffic and shut down for nearly an hour every Friday during the entire week.\nDuring the years 1960 and 1968, the river's level continued to rise over the decades, reaching a plateau almost three centuries ago, when the river eventually reached its current

{"id":701,"ended":true,"length":595,"text":"Most restorations of ceratopsians show them with erect hindlimbs but semi @ - @ sprawling forelimbs, which suggest that they were not fast movers. But Paul and Christiansen ( 2000 ) argued that the erect hindlimbs are likely to suggest that they were a kind of pendent, or the head of the body, while Christophers legs ( 2000 ) suggested that they were the forelimb of the body ( see ep 1 & 5 )\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper shows how the erect hindlimbs are much like the forelimbs in Stempel. It is important to observe that if the erect hindlimbs are really erect, they can be said to be the forelimb of the body (cf. Rom 2:6 ). The erect hindlimbs are a relatively simple building block to erect to. They can be thought of in terms of a kind of elongation, which implies that the whole length of the leg is always extended to the length of the trunk or the trunk is always compressed to the length of the back side (cf. Rom 25:4 ). They need also to be known to have a specific length in mind. As for the other leg of the body, it would be impossible to give exact figures (cf. the legs).\n\nTherefore, it is important to conclude that the erect hindlimb is likely as long as the trunk (cf. 2:3 ) is compressed to the length of the rear side (cf. Rom 5:11 ). It is also important to note that the erect hindlimb could be also used of the other leg. For instance, to allow the trunk to be compressed to the length of the back side (cf. Rom 14:5 ), in order that it could be able to carry the trunk to the trunk where the trunk would not have had any effect at all.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is the end product of all this. While there are others who have attempted to argue that the erect hindlimb was constructed of \u201cproper leg material\u201d (cf. Rom 4:31), this paper gives no clear evidence to support their assertions. It is therefore important that we investigate the origins of Christ\u2019s legs. It is at this point that it becomes possible to demonstrate that the erect hindlimb was in fact constructed by individuals, and not as a construction or an item of material. This case shows that the erect hindlimb was manufactured by individuals, because the male leg consisted of four broad legs and four narrow legs (cf. Rom 4:31 ). It is a fact that Christ\u2019s legs were made by individuals rather than of a single male leg (cf. Rom 1:2) and thus they had nothing in common with the male (cf. Rom 4:31 ). Therefore, it may be inferred that the erect hindlimb was constructed using multiple materials.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll these are the only definite conclusions this case shows that an erect hindlimb was a built-on construction, and not a construction of \u201cproper leg material\u201d. This is the conclusion of the article that Christ\u2019s legs were constructed by individuals, because the erect hindlimb thus is constructed by individuals rather than of a single male legs which constitute the erect hindlimb.","token_len":678,"entropy":[8.6157,4.5803,0.1211,1.7129,10.9955,4.7256,1.6192,2.5017,7.2414,4.3181,4.1614,7.1696,7.5593,2.821,0.0879,6.0833,10.2497,14.9885,6.7031,6.5895,12.852,5.6509,0.7095,0.0371,2.2292,3.741,4.9036,1.8906,1.0188,1.6786,3.3842,8.4007,9.7822,0.429,1.0341,4.8773,10.7988,3.9992,9.7593,3.4022,2.277,9.1148,0.1597,4.9154,0.1926,1.6269,4.6858,1.1059,0.051,0.044,2.8379,4.4826,1.3949,5.5849,1.1823,1.1656,0.4704,4.3346,4.2396,0.0707,7.1022,5.1353,3.4779,3.0054,5.5251,4.2481,1.5384,1.3267,2.8892,1.2596,3.6583,5.3686,8.5463,12.7152,3.462,4.1548,0.1159,1.5842,0.4676,0.8517,0.3909,2.5505,3.9183,0.3681,3.2784,0.6959,0.487,0.9469,2.135,5.4483,7.6844,5.786,5.433,4.651,3.2846,2.0947,0.0124,7.9529,0.6113,0.0003,3.4797,2.8854,2.9383,2.5061,1.7731,4.6569,0.4808,0.0109,0.0738,2.1276,6.0141,2.9612,0.7722,1.7676,0.059,0.2848,1.8693,6.2509,6.2634,3.4454,4.4268,2.7556,1.8133,2.9137,0.1516,6.6379,0.3747,4.8764,1.4033,3.2878,0.118,0.0019,0.0186,0.998,5.7728,3.9624,0.8024,1.5189,3.2324,1.1104,4.053,0.0256,0.9532,2.4983,2.183,0.0923,1.889,0.4149,0.4471,0.2835,2.1129,3.8595,0.472,5.359,3.6144,0.1716,3.1281,3.3274,2.2804,4.0903,0.1111,0.0029,0.0188,1.0427,3.5115,5.6064,2.6651,5.9682,0.8551,3.3701,4.1477,5.8956,3.9361,2.0461,2.5101,0.4737,4.0923,0.0769,3.4661,1.4937,0.0055,1.6817,4.4022,0.0014,6.8556,2.7029,2.2372,2.1844,4.8647,0.4973,1.1084,4.3026,4.4841,0.2995,0.1884,4.5512,1.2474,5.8802,3.4032,2.6639,1.0185,5.136,0.1205,0.1153,5.0533,3.3932,2.9094,3.0264,2.2062,1.3446,5.9334,1.7426,0.6066,2.3924,0.1132,0.0607,4.7765,5.7633,1.8782,1.5225,0.0068,1.1511,6.0238,0.0307,3.6845,1.0275,3.9159,5.8946,5.5971,1.1798,0.1833,4.8945,1.3749,2.6658,1.5121,5.675,3.3524,3.3247,4.8018,1.4141,4.282,3.8464,0.4941,4.2228,4.0384,3.7465,0.49,0.4516,0.3996,1.6785,3.7345,0.9767,4.4502,0.4707,4.7721,3.4704,2.1046,3.8198,2.7219,0.0103,5.4165,6.8439,4.2934,1.6168,0.0003,5.8098,0.4406,1.937,0.5461,1.6073,0.1114,6.1034,0.5514,0.9672,2.3087,0.0791,0.0026,4.3387,1.1602,5.4664,6.81,3.5366,0.0974,0.4369,1.8533,2.6812,1.9764,0.0028,3.1044,2.6648,3.1932,2.615,2.6959,1.7223,0.8489,0.2066,0.5807,0.083,0.0414,4.6714,1.1553,1.1635,0.4889,0.0009,0.842,3.1659,0.0195,3.2793,0.5066,2.4467,0.6348,1.246,1.2938,0.0957,0.848,0.088,0.9885,2.9071,0.0802,0.0026,1.1344,4.3758,0.885,5.434,2.8945,5.7352,0.9667,3.9074,0.7736,2.6634,2.488,1.9611,0.1245,4.8047,4.9836,1.1556,1.5566,0.224,1.3213,0.9179,0.6546,0.2221,0.4129,0.0494,0.0808,1.9238,0.3317,1.6262,0.7564,0.001,0.6987,5.1828,0.0136,3.1871,0.6327,5.4977,1.9619,3.9305,1.5707,2.012,0.5619,3.4928,0.004,4.4472,1.35,2.2241,2.7633,0.5628,3.2994,5.4877,1.2175,1.7147,2.5692,2.6998,2.6473,5.4196,3.4737,4.6481,4.7303,0.1437,1.4586,1.0233,0.0003,5.2059,0.1553,0.0002,1.9031,2.305,2.1106,5.9387,5.3344,0.1933,4.8845,2.7557,2.7148,4.7849,2.8505,0.8675,5.6179,1.489,1.9627,4.1244,0.1983,3.7954,0.4727,0.5411,1.6807,0.0517,0.0025,1.4014,2.2654,5.8316,2.4881,14.6209,6.7661,6.6347,1.6457,4.9834,5.5183,4.4146,6.8388,2.6806,2.7541,0.0041,1.6736,2.895,0.0236,5.4174,3.0643,2.3836,2.7973,4.4623,3.7049,4.5982,2.2637,2.0752,0.6348,2.4662,4.3652,0.3081,2.3101,0.9264,3.9449,2.0737,2.6375,1.4171,4.9703,1.3441,5.731,0.1753,5.444,11.247,6.4759,1.458,3.071,1.4332,2.7801,0.4204,5.8045,0.3227,0.1844,0.2859,2.9089,1.4143,2.7969,0.0933,5.3015,0.6675,0.9329,2.8279,0.05,0.0028,1.0146,0.692,4.5357,0.1014,2.8999,2.5024,6.0162,3.0192,2.3933,1.0979,4.0488,0.5288,5.4944,4.5706,3.5312,5.7144,0.8763,5.7112,0.8504,3.0822,6.501,3.769,0.5972,1.138,2.9475,0.0276,0.0015,0.3078,1.1213,7.51,1.1791,0.7386,1.3078,5.6004,2.1128,7.5174,2.5996,6.4725,0.2723,4.5436,5.5976,1.2005,2.2507,2.1573,2.0091,0.398,1.8397,1.019,0.0027,0.6891,1.428,0.0055,1.3539,1.3096,2.3195,0.5733,4.4111,3.0398,0.1646,3.1761,3.6984,0.0895,0.007,0.5567,0.9364,3.0841,1.3445,0.7245,4.0155,0.0073,6.1702,2.3392,1.1912,6.3808,2.279,1.6725,0.5418,0.0014,0.4189,3.1099,0.0149,3.6451,5.2137,1.3226,4.104,3.7702,4.0022,6.1048,2.4052,0.0051,0.2358,1.3436,3.6027,5.1201,0.5487,0.001,0.4961,1.8113,0.0066,0.6588,0.2936,3.847,0.3157,1.1478,4.1404,0.479,5.0602,0.2863,0.6949,1.1813,0.0056,0.0029,0.0567,0.5069,2.8374,4.9035,5.8434,6.587,1.4374,0.8855,0.0002,3.7847,0.138,0.0001,5.3624,2.6686,4.2345,3.5813,5.2524,6.772,3.3749,6.1591,5.777,3.9048,1.8825,5.8837,0.4333,0.0671,0.0055,0.0169,1.0282,3.2976,5.7213,1.6013,2.6016,2.2063,2.2072,1.293,1.6169,1.0269,2.7797,1.1939,6.2466,0.1895,1.3695,0.0087,0.6996,0.088,2.4626,0.8478,0.5705,2.9775,1.1757,2.2119,2.4735,1.7695,1.3305,4.1333,2.6405,4.6727,0.6572,0.0102,0.0071,0.3543,0.4692,1.648,1.3002,0.3519,1.679,2.7787,1.1582,1.0621,0.0042,0.0021,0.0101,8.6953,4.1969,2.9428,2.0094,0.3043,0.7375,0.0121,0.3826,0.0989,0.0237,1.1027,6.9526,6.6871,6.8313,0.7237,2.219,0.0474,0.0023,0.019,0.5982]}
{"id":635,"ended":false,"length":651,"text":"Because Miami received the ball to begin the game, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. After Miami's kickoff and a touchback, Tech began the first possession of the second quarter on the move. The first drive saw Tech going for three points and the second drive saw Tech go scoring, scoring twice. Once Tech was back on track, Miami began to find their rhythm. Tech scored four times in the first half to lead, scoring on touchdowns with runs of 8 and 7 yards. Tech began second quarter on a seven-play drive with a 20 yard touchdown and a 2 yard touchdown and a 5 yard touchdown pass to Austin Moore. Tech scored again two plays later with a 17 yard touchdown and had another 14 yards drive that completed the second half. Tech was unable to tie the game to match their season high score of 37 yards in the third quarter. Miami ended the second half with their lowest total during the season due to the final drive of the game when Tech scored the first touchdown and had their first scoring drive of the season on its second play of the second quarter. Miami also had an incredible halftime performance as they scored in the second half 21\u201313 and were only allowed to run back and gain one point. Miami was able to find their identity as a team early in the third quarter and the first ten minutes went by quickly with Tech coming back to get it back within their own 10 yard line before Tech scored again. On the next possession, Tech turned the ball over and missed their third field goal of the season. Finally, Tech came out for only nine yards against Virginia Tech. They were able to finish on the second and third-quarter scores, scoring the first touchdown and adding the second touchdown to match their season high score of 17 yards in the third quarter. After Tech's late touchdown, Tech had their sixth first quarter touchdown of the game with a 28-yard touchdown pass from Sam DeShone to Austin Moore on the night. After Tech's first field goal of the night of 16\u201312, Tech got their second touchdown of the game on the first play of kickoff. Tech lost to Virginia Tech 49\u20136 and ended their season. They won the next two games to close out their regular season.\n\nCollege history\nMiami started the 2012 season with two seasons under head coach Greg Hill in which they finished tied for third place in the Atlantic Coast Conference (AC) standings. However, they turned back at the start of 2013, losing to Oklahoma and San Jose State which they defeated 47\u201314. Hill had a much better first year compared in college history, which was also the last year of his second year in charge. With Hill coming into office and the program making progress the next coach hired him. On January 2, 2013, he hired Scott Frost as his new coach. Frost came in with three wins in his three years at Miami. He was joined by Brian Clements (19th season) as the new head coach of Miami. On January 3, 2013, he named Scott Frost as the interim head coach of the team. Soon after, head coach Frost was also able to begin the season at Florida State, starting the season with two wins, two losses, and a loss. Florida State lost to Boise State and the Miami Hurricanes, which helped put Hill in his place.\n\nCoaching record\n\nSeason record\n\nReferences","token_len":680,"entropy":[11.3336,5.891,2.0668,4.0406,4.6096,3.5354,0.48,2.3161,0.4043,8.5586,2.0453,5.1562,0.7412,0.1399,1.5218,2.2684,0.1254,1.0024,0.2039,0.7959,4.0085,2.4817,2.2307,7.0016,4.222,2.7641,6.759,0.0554,1.1201,4.9794,5.8204,1.2528,3.6165,5.9515,1.6096,0.1614,1.7095,2.6388,3.5382,1.7828,5.8843,1.2475,2.1045,3.5686,3.1022,4.2878,2.3748,6.9781,2.2232,4.0631,3.7118,2.1725,3.0762,1.5371,1.9431,0.3818,1.3129,1.7026,8.2527,4.7693,4.9643,3.9965,0.8309,6.6271,1.3989,2.4757,3.4393,1.0808,2.7643,0.5196,1.9882,4.6372,1.3662,5.1153,2.9854,0.4714,1.0477,3.0766,3.3046,2.9248,1.7109,1.2482,0.1616,0.6471,0.8418,1.9059,3.1136,3.9424,4.7298,2.8348,6.3511,4.4569,8.5195,1.5041,5.1365,0.9462,3.0981,0.1464,0.5657,2.2028,4.9732,8.9861,1.8756,2.5408,0.8641,4.5983,0.5245,0.6673,0.9955,2.1324,1.9859,4.6664,4.0935,2.2591,4.9883,1.3092,4.7634,0.9664,2.4734,6.8483,1.343,4.406,0.224,1.2189,3.1315,1.5445,5.2872,5.7685,0.5136,2.2034,3.0965,2.5201,4.8049,1.6832,0.0176,2.6139,0.6417,3.3854,0.414,0.6835,2.481,6.8311,3.5072,4.2281,2.2581,6.5145,3.8716,6.8743,1.4291,4.2184,0.1444,0.6061,1.7266,3.0881,4.2979,0.0024,5.876,0.3105,0.1964,5.5265,9.952,2.2661,3.7741,1.3148,3.904,0.8542,5.2729,2.7398,2.709,0.0782,1.6507,0.0872,0.5737,1.3862,5.0212,0.3807,2.0752,0.2984,0.6811,4.2089,5.1232,2.1104,7.4261,0.5239,2.6485,6.6456,0.0612,2.4469,6.119,2.0075,0.7926,0.1528,0.7582,4.323,2.7163,2.416,3.24,1.6442,1.7015,3.3242,3.265,3.9841,1.4202,3.5718,0.2055,0.6418,0.0198,2.8625,3.6056,4.7333,2.9689,2.3005,0.789,0.0185,2.0075,1.0952,0.2081,1.2594,4.0385,1.3716,3.5944,4.989,4.4216,1.667,2.3724,0.5589,2.5906,5.1069,0.995,1.8536,0.264,5.4182,9.1269,2.9235,2.341,3.8564,4.2932,2.7072,0.8706,3.1171,5.7137,3.4657,4.5811,3.6523,1.677,1.1936,1.3857,2.6198,1.1297,0.0057,5.5303,1.3283,6.2152,2.2821,0.5407,1.372,4.5608,0.7284,0.0232,1.4395,0.053,1.6989,3.8875,3.1026,6.4871,0.7497,4.3432,2.3998,3.1422,2.9865,1.6016,3.811,2.3739,1.689,4.0733,3.9105,1.4745,4.4962,5.3682,0.8341,2.593,1.4724,0.552,4.3303,3.3911,3.4026,2.3162,1.7867,4.712,0.6407,1.3137,2.371,1.047,1.0466,5.2215,0.941,0.0767,0.0201,2.0103,7.0672,4.4762,3.1197,3.1325,0.0104,1.1889,0.0081,3.1107,1.2044,6.4027,0.4509,1.0406,3.641,2.2329,4.3003,7.2748,5.5564,0.6619,5.1734,2.3671,0.031,1.7683,4.0996,2.3415,0.745,0.0025,4.1012,5.0783,0.9333,5.5526,2.9984,0.6568,7.3594,2.7455,4.9603,2.4169,3.5722,3.2776,1.7156,1.1732,1.4001,4.8192,2.8443,1.5634,2.736,1.5766,6.0208,0.3692,0.3195,0.3965,1.5237,0.2757,3.5411,0.9234,1.0133,0.0237,0.4409,0.1358,0.1544,3.5528,2.3958,2.5579,6.2526,1.9785,1.2972,2.2943,3.2976,1.7762,5.8837,5.0985,1.217,1.9864,0.5738,0.0224,3.1243,2.3822,0.972,4.3151,0.879,0.3426,1.3024,0.9273,2.1735,6.6633,5.3815,4.3002,1.8678,0.9985,1.7967,0.1835,3.6617,0.7536,7.9075,0.7392,3.2309,1.5091,1.9335,1.5993,3.7201,0.0061,0.9696,0.0053,2.4404,5.6588,5.5824,1.358,3.2394,0.3919,1.7563,4.2799,1.9984,1.5153,2.3571,0.4884,0.0067,0.435,1.826,1.3553,3.5466,0.5792,0.1368,10.4857,1.3875,1.4392,6.512,3.088,0.6527,0.0188,6.2186,0.9368,4.2695,2.5052,4.351,1.7069,0.9265,3.5247,3.9634,4.1982,0.9158,4.2399,0.9725,0.2577,2.6205,3.0953,0.4619,1.8834,1.8663,0.0155,1.4939,1.3738,0.0532,4.0195,9.6676,1.24,24.3272,4.232,1.0817,3.9779,0.459,1.7518,3.3697,6.2984,3.6341,2.7044,0.0388,4.9822,8.311,3.7152,3.3516,0.5158,1.7185,3.7555,0.4332,2.26,3.0863,0.3978,0.1553,3.9895,1.0422,0.0058,3.4114,6.7363,1.1587,3.3533,0.9092,3.2615,0.0391,1.8401,6.2798,6.6427,4.8997,1.4441,2.1678,0.0159,3.9553,2.2693,2.6054,0.6922,4.4607,2.2449,5.7009,1.3185,0.0312,6.3024,2.9116,4.0199,6.0832,0.0236,3.1896,0.8276,7.0773,2.6735,2.25,5.0252,1.4207,3.6069,2.7396,6.2167,9.256,5.3237,2.4004,2.2411,5.0372,1.7688,3.3741,1.8638,3.8445,2.0269,1.6489,1.8805,4.5222,2.2951,1.3175,2.0943,1.0357,4.4164,2.9901,3.7839,2.7549,7.7794,3.0641,2.2045,4.507,4.5889,4.2958,5.59,3.3744,7.4671,4.7888,3.874,2.2839,4.5891,2.5086,3.3865,0.3883,1.2294,0.2022,2.3932,1.5233,4.9782,2.1348,1.4224,1.4316,0.6676,2.5318,0.6578,1.139,4.8636,1.2805,1.9998,4.7366,2.9879,1.1872,1.1032,4.8425,1.2195,1.9075,1.6472,1.4169,1.7274,1.9728,7.1337,0.2753,5.014,6.3072,5.7643,2.8258,4.9159,4.4325,1.1235,1.7739,1.7414,1.1284,0.9537,0.698,0.0465,2.1123,2.4787,1.1708,4.2307,1.129,2.6696,0.1342,0.8909,0.0949,2.4124,4.7985,4.7945,3.1357,0.7914,1.3733,3.5847,0.3464,0.0168,0.9815,0.2775,2.9645,0.3348,6.9139,0.1082,0.7777,6.6917,0.0569,7.3857,1.6293,5.7885,6.6969,0.003,5.324,1.3206,1.4281,2.7884,2.544,0.9206,2.0763,4.8746,1.25,0.5889,1.2065,3.5496,0.5759,3.3192,3.201,0.2722,1.1201,0.3561,1.1659,1.7783,0.9162,4.1057,0.032,3.1981,0.8949,7.6812,0.0036,1.9155,3.1983,4.2275,1.3976,2.6665,2.6026,4.8972,3.6316,5.622,1.0612,2.9787,1.3879,0.4519,2.2198,0.0003,5.8742,0.4737,5.7281,0.38,0.0004,7.1718,2.4153,2.093,0.0002,9.2714]}

Sitatunga, the United Kingdom, is one of the four largest biodiverse towns in Southern Africa, based mainly on water pollution, and its main water source is an integrated water-based, integrated hydropower development system. `` A study of the local population of the town had shown that Nki's average annual population was only around 40 percent of that of neighboring Kampala and Bulandshwa. `` Thus, if Nki could be converted to drinking water, it would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. `` One of the environmental experts, Ms Nkulululegah and Ms Bongwane, says that to turn Nki into a water-sourced environment, a project would need to be undertaken by a third party. `` \" Ms Bongwane further says that in the project, Nki would need to have drinking water sourced from its sewage water sources. `` \" Dr Tanzanian researchers have found that drinking water with a healthy flow can reduce the incidence of diarrhea in people in Nki and to improve the health of the people in the town, as well as prevent disease from making their lives more precarious.``\n\nDr Nkululegah (left) with an analysis of water samples from the towns of Luangpisa, Kampala and Kwebu, Zambia.

The FNAO intends to issue the recommendations by the end of 2018. FNAO's aim is to promote climate change adaptation in every country according to the local and international needs and policies.\n\nSource: www.globaleconews.org.za\n\nThe views expressed here by GlobalEconews are the author's own.

{"id":4746,"ended":false,"length":660,"text":"The championship resumed one month later in Belgium. Jenson Button qualified on pole and broke away at the start while a four @ - @ car pile @ - @ up started behind him, leaving him on the outside. The first car of the day went into service and the next the # 2 cars, # 1 and # 2 cars, got in service. As the # 1 car went into service, there was no reaction from those cars and the # 2 cars got in service. The next 1.1 laps were fast, and the #2 cars set new lap record. Jenson Button started on fourth. Next was # 1 and # 2 drivers, and # 4. Jenson Button broke away from the race car and set the lap record.\nThe final track was a one-mile dirt track at the turn of the track, one lap at a time, with a field of just 19 cars. After the top ten cars were out of the race car, it was on the track, and that was it. At the end of that race, the last driver who had any fun was given his name to remember by winning the race.\nIn the end, Jenson Button won the race. Then, it was time for the next day, and he could rest for rest and recover. After that, the rest of the teams were in town.\nWith the next race on their hands, we took the first weekend of April back at Mont Blanc, and we were out on a beautiful weekend. With plenty of work and preparation, we headed to Mont Blanc for our weekend home race. We took our pick of the top ten circuits that weekend, and we had a blast. We didn't need to do anything in order to get to the top of each circuit, just the basics.\nWe rode around Mont Blanc for a while, and made many friends there. We spent the day taking photos and talking to the locals. We also enjoyed some free time at the Grand Canyon with some of our group of friends. We also got to see the top four teams of the season.\nFor the week of April 18-19, we enjoyed our weekend at Mont Blanc in the same circuit which led to our return to Mont Blanc at the end of April to enjoy the race weekend.\nWhat was your weekend like?\nIn the end, we rode very well for the weekend. We made it through all of the circuits, but at the end, Mont Blanc was the only circuit where we made a difference. We made a ton of new friends throughout the week, and in a way, that was a big plus.\nWhat are your priorities for your next race for next year?\nRight now, the focus is to continue to build on our winning pace this year, while making sure that we continue our great work on our technical features in order to continue building on the momentum that we gave to Mont Blanc with our current season.\nOur championship this year will be an almost exclusively professional level race. That's the only racing you can do at Mont Blanc. As an additional bonus, there are a couple of events we have planned during the entire week, the most of which will take place in the mountains. This is another way we were able to make the most out of our time at Mont Blanc.\nWe are looking forward to seeing you in April 2021.

{"id":1835,"ended":true,"length":640,"text":"The categorization of Ceres has changed more than once and has been the subject of some disagreement. Johann Elert Bode believed Ceres to be the `` missing planet `` he had proposed to exist in the 1776 book, describing itself as an `` arid landscape `` and an `` urban legend `` about `` the sun and earth ``.\n\nThere have been many, many suggestions for an `` \" `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` ```` `` `` `` `` ```` `` `` `` `` `` `` ``\n\nThis was a significant discovery for me because we only started to use the science of the sun and the earth together.\n\nBut there are also certain problems.\n\nThe most obvious issues are not only the color of the water in the pictures but the shape of the rock. Most water is a bright red and the picture itself reflects more than a yellow in many cases.\n\nIt is not in this respect that we use gravity to estimate water in the color of the pictures. Rather there is no natural trend toward the red in these pictures and, therefore, we only derive the green from the red.\n\nThe second problem is the color of the rock.\n\nOn one hand this is a major issue because it points to where the sun is and where the earth has grown. On the other it is a major issue because there is a huge volume of water being stored in the rivers and lakes of the globe. There are many countries in the world of the earth that would prefer that the earth was completely clear and completely dry. When we look at a picture we can see that the sky is completely in the southern hemisphere and the sun is in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThen this area of the red world is completely in the southern hemisphere so there are some areas that are clear from all directions.\n\nFrom the north we can see the south, but there is quite less clear of the northern hemisphere for the south.\n\nWhat should we do about this?\n\nWe know very well what is likely to be a major disaster in the north in the next few years.\n\nFor us this will most likely be the last major disaster of the era.\n\nIt is clear that it is going to be a major problem for the earth. If it had been a drought it would not be a major problem except for drought conditions, because drought conditions are not always easy to predict and the problem arises because of high water level conditions, especially during severe drought seasons.\n\nBut it is an issue that is likely to be caused by water levels or even extreme dryness. In the next few years we will see many rivers and lakes disappearing. The effects will be far-reaching.\n\nThis is a problem because there has been a great deal of water in the northern hemisphere as well as the southern one. The southern and northern regions have an increasing amount of water which needs to be put in reservoirs and water is being pumped from all over the world. If there are water shortages in these areas, then the world will be in the worst of many possible crises.\n\nThis is what is going to lead to a new and long-lasting crisis which will put a tremendous strain on all of us and make the world worse than it already

{"id":1008,"ended":false,"length":611,"text":"In July 2000, McCall accepted his first coaching role, when he was appointed assistant manager to Chris Hutchings at Bradford City, after Hutchings was promoted from the role to replace Paul Jewell, the former managing director of Derby County. Although he managed a winning three-year spell, the Yorkshire club managed just 4 points from a possible 23 points, just two out of the eight places that it was placed in at the season-end.\n\nIn the following years, McCall served as the managing director of Derby County, which was relegated from the Championship. During these spells, Leeds kept up their excellent and successful play-off qualification campaign with a third-placed place in the Championship Division One standings. In 2004, Derby got relegated from the Championship, where they won their only place in the Championship. With their Championship season already over, McCall was offered another job with Derby \u2014 this time as manager of the Sheffield Shield champions.\n\nOn May 25, 2001, in order for the England national team to participate in the 2002 World Cup, they needed a win in their final training camp. Despite losing the third game they should have won in a 4\u20130 victory or 4\u20133 draw against Wales, and due to the weather conditions and the fact the players were in a very hot and humid start to training, they were beaten by Italy.\n\nIn February 2004, McCall was appointed as the England manager for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He completed a record 46th year being a manager with Yorkshire County after a turbulent season. During his spell, McCall was promoted to assistant manager to Chris Hutchings, who had been sacked by both Leeds and Derby in October 1999 after nine years. With Hutchings having arrived in early 2000, McCall managed a strong and successful run in the Championship with Leeds who won the Championship for the first time since the 1994\u201397 season.\n\nMcCall remained at Derby until the end of the 2003\u201304 season, when they finished 19 points adrift of the top three. They remained in the Championship until December 2004, when they finished 10 points adrift of the top three. McCall was sacked by West Bromwich Albion in January 2005. In October 2007 they were allowed to start at the Championship club's home venue, Millwall, for the first time. The club was relegated from the Championship in November 2008.\n\nIn July 2007, McCall joined Championship side Middlesbrough at the start of a two-year contract and they finished 13 points adrift of the top half of the Championship. They had won 13 in a row from 1998\u201399. Over the next two seasons, Leeds were able to earn just 18 points from nine games. In the 2009\u201310 season they finished 15 points adrift of fifth-placed Nottingham Forest.\n\nIn October 2011, it was reported that McCall had suffered a stroke and was in an emergency suite at St Johnstone Hospital.

The individual chapters were published by Yuki Azuma, as an eBook. Yuki Azuma also illustrated the original book, Snow, in its original edition, as an ebook. The original version of Snow was serialized between the September and December 2002 issues of Comptiq. The novel was translated into English on the American and Korean editions, and released in April, 2005, and is now a trademark of Xing, a Taiwanese and Japanese manga publisher.\n\nSynopsis\n\n(In English) - Snow is a modern adaptation of a classic manga series from the late 1990s, Snow: Pure White, based on a short story line from Sun Tzu : Soul of Snow - translated by Yuki Azuma.\n\nIn the novel, Yuki Azuma's snowmen, Snow & Snow, are the children of Yuki and Yuki's best friend, Yuki's best friend, Sun Tzu. Yuki's name is given by Sun Tzu to Snow because of his ability to write snowman - and therefore Snow. Sun Tzu is a master of the human race, and snowmen are supposed to be his creations. Sun Tzu was created in 1748 by the early explorer, Jintai Tsukuchi. Sun Tzu named his Snow because Snow is one of the ten great men of the Chinese empire of the late 17th century, Sun Sun also named his Snow because of his ability to write snowman. Sun Sun also named his Snow because Snow is a great man of the Chinese empire.\n\n\"Snow White\" by Yuki Azuma\n\"Snow\" by Yuki Azuma\n\n\"Snow White\" written by Yuki Azuma\n\nReviewers\nYuki Azuma has stated: \"This can't be. Yuki, my snowman, was created in 1648 by Jintai Tsukuchi. Sun Sun is a master of the human race and his Snow is a great man of the Chinese empire. Sun Sun who created Snow is now an American-German comic character with his Snow. Now we're looking through his books. Yuki, he's got his Snow and he wrote his Snow. Please check his books.\"\n\nNina Shumzhan, reviewer at Anime Central, told a similar story: \"Snow White's journey to an unknown world and its aftermath is a joy and delight. Her world has a lot of mysteries behind it and some of them are rather confusing, but it is one enjoyable read.\"\n\nKiki Saito, reviewer at Japan's Yakuza Online, wrote that the story \"exposes the complexity and meaning of life in China\". She added: \"It's not a novel where the plot takes an entirely new turn. A novel that's different and different in several ways can have a very different effect on people.\"\n\nKiki Saito wrote: \"Snow White is really beautiful.

{"id":2941,"ended":false,"length":588,"text":"Wohlwend met Mike Boxleiter in an experimental video game development class they took together at Iowa State University. Wohlwend had attempted to help Boxleiter with a project, but quit after drawing a few different animations \u2013 and received a call from someone asking if he would work with them again.\n\nA month later, he started working with two artists, who also had experience with the software and their prototypes. \u201cI did a lot more stuff with the animations. It started with using a tool called the animator. It\u2019s a type of animation where you animate a specific thing and it\u2019s also called an animator\u2026 and it\u2019s kind of fun to use,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were working on something that looks pretty cool because everything else is done as though it\u2019s already done. I just didn\u2019t want to leave off any more of that.\u201d\n\nThe pair have since made a couple of animated videos for the project, and had previously worked in games, both of which they would have loved to continue in. They also have an ongoing animation project with a school in Michigan.\n\nWohlwend is looking for an associate and intern to help work with and teach animation, particularly in the animation department. He will be teaching animation at the University of Iowa for a couple of months before moving to his main role\u2014to teach more animation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a very active creative and artistic soul, and I thought \u2018Hey, what\u2019s my mission of this job?\u2019 It\u2019s become clear to me that I\u2019m not a creative or artistic person,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the way I can use my skill in animation to my intended purpose is to help me find a way to express myself so that I can live the life I want to.\u201d\n\nThe internship will entail a lot of fun and learning around. \u201cI learned a lot, and it was amazing seeing a whole lot of different things that I wasn\u2019t already used to. I got to get to know other people in the same way which was pretty awesome,\u201d he said.\n\nWohlwend said his passion for doing art comes from the fact that his first work \u201ccame out of an art degree\u201d but came from \u201cbeing exposed to various cultures\u201d and studying subjects that weren\u2019t easy for him to work on. \u201cWhen you\u2019re working for a college environment, which you might be able to do in your own home, you need to know what to do and how to do it, which is definitely something that I definitely try to emulate,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s trying to find a more comfortable environment at U.S.A. because of the nature of his work. \u201cI\u2019ve had an amazing time working in a very different environment than I had expected, so hopefully it\u2019ll

{"id":3806,"ended":false,"length":661,"text":"In September 2006, Lethem wrote the article, `` The Genius of Bob Dylan ``, a lengthy interview with Bob Dylan, which was published in Rolling Stone. The interview contained Lethem's comments about the writer, describing the writer as \"like a kind of father\". The magazine later included an interview with Lethem in a 1995 article entitled \"The Genius of Bob Dylan\", which also included \"A New Way to Live\". Lethem did not publish the interview in the magazine's print edition.[21]\n\nIn 1992, Lethem published the autobiography Bob Dylan: On the Run?, a collection of interviews that appeared in 1992 and 1993. It included quotes from Dylan as well as lyrics from the album. One of the quotes from the book was written by poet David Brooks. In 1994, as a result of the AIDS outbreak, Lethem published The Memoirs of a Man Who Lost the Power to Run a Country Club.\n\nOn May 25, 2001, in order for the song lyrics and song lyrics of Lethem to have a proper connection with the song \"We Were Never Together\", he changed the lyrics \"Love, wherefore my heart goes to, has come for only what have you done and I have broken the old man's heart.\" To this day, Lethem has still managed to maintain the song lyrics, but he has switched them back to more contemporary lyrics. When he sings, ''He came down from my heart'' at the end, he is clearly not being serious about his words and lyrics of \u201cLove, wherefore my heart goes to.\u201d But when he sings, ''I had to go down that way'' (like \"I had to go down that way [which] I had to go down the way [which] I had to go down the way you go, had to go down that way, too), it was to live the life of a man. If I came down that way, I would like to return to the way I was...\u201d\n\nAccording to Dylan, it was a mistake to sing the song. He did not know if any of his songs would be featured in the film. After all the movie had produced some songs by Bob Dylan, it was enough for him to be taken seriously by the audience.\n\nIn September 2007, in order for the song lyrics and song lyrics of Lethem to have a proper connection with the song \"We were Never Together\", He told a press conference in a London newspaper, which was an indication of the problems of AIDS in the world, that it was a mistake for him to write the song \"We Were Never Together\". With Lethem's help, the writer and rapper, David Brooks, collaborated to write and perform the song about the man who lost the ability to run a country club. Brooks shared it with his fans on the Twitter-Post. He explained in an interview that there were a few people who were angry that this song was being released in this day and age. Brooks himself confessed that it is his responsibility to show that all young men and women can turn away from drugs, because it is the right thing to do!

{"id":1644,"ended":true,"length":605,"text":"The beak of the kakapo is adapted for grinding food finely. For this reason, the kakapo has a very small gizzard compared to other birds of their size. It is generally herbivorous, and not eating the plants of itself. Although, most kakapo have an edible, and non-eatable, body while a small number of other species are less, the kakapo are quite large and have a very strong beak.\n\nThis is why I find the beak to be a good, if somewhat controversial, source of nutritional information. There are kakapo with a fat gizzard that are relatively easy to catch, eat and harvest and only require a small gizzard. There are more species that are easily eaten that have little gizzard and are only a relatively few as to be found in the wild. The kakapo has very little nutritional value unless you eat them with their flesh. I also find the kakapo more than suitable for meat or for non-meat and dairy consumption in most areas. These populations have been found very heavily depleted.\n\nThe kakapo have very little nutritional value with regards to meat production. However, there are only a few populations that have been found in the wild and it\u2019s still quite popular.\n\nOn top of this the kakapo have numerous advantages in terms of quality of life. They are less prone to damage. If it\u2019s not damaged there is a good chance that it will survive. If it is damaged they will get better food and use less energy for many of the other benefits.\n\nThe kakapo also have very high levels of potassium and calcium and the kakapo have low levels of these in the dietary world. In the food world the kakapo have little to no health problems such as heart condition, kidney disease, diabetes, liver disease, hypertension, and cancer.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe kakapo have a very strong, but not great, nutritional value of its own. Not to be confused with the kakapo that are just eaten in small bites. If any of these species is eaten as often as the kakapo does it\u2019s still a good option to start with.\n\nThe kakapo are often left for some time at a source of food that\u2019s not as fresh as the kakapo. This is important because this can be a major reason why they\u2019re not well known and they are easy to obtain and often find their way into wild food quickly. Furthermore those of us who are aware of kakapo and kakapo are able to find them quickly and for good. These people are known for the excellent smell they deliver and that provides plenty of health benefits for individuals who live close by farms.\n\nIf you look back over the past couple of years there has been a lot of discussion of the health benefits of the kakapo. They have been very well known. It\u2019s been over 5 decades since the first taste of kakapo were produced and people still make them. Today they are popular in the US and Canada.

{"id":1614,"ended":true,"length":606,"text":"Barrow returned to baseball in 1910, managing Montreal. The Eastern League hired Barrow as its president the next year, giving him an annual salary of $ 7 @, @ 500 (in the upper 50s ) & $ 25.5B a year for life. He helped the Eastern League win the Western League World Series two years in a row.. The trade of Joe Horn as manager of the New York Yankees to the Texas Rangers did not go down well with the club's owner. In 1934 the Yankees traded Horn to the Texas Rangers in exchange for outfielder Victor Reyes. Horn and Reyes became teammates on and off the field. Horn and Reyes both finished their career with two seasons of professional baseball and had an overall career total of 12,070 career runs.The final game was a game against the Kansas City Royals in November 1939. Horn won the game, going on to hit a solo homer in the seventh inning while Reyes scored on a pair of doubles by Victor Hernandez and Victor Martinez. The game was moved to Kansas City in 1940, and a month later the game was abandoned.In August 1939 the Baltimore Orioles selected Horn with the third overall pick in the MLB Draft, placing him first overall in the first annual draft. His major league career included 24 All-Star games, a pennant-winning season in 1939, a major league record for a player as young as Horn, and the most complete regular season baseball season in history. He played in almost all four major league games that season, and finished with a career-best 3,543 RBI's, including 2,100 homers.Despite his great career, however, the Orioles also made the cut-off list for a spot in the All-Star Game as a player. Horn was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, where he spent the next two seasons with Toronto, reaching the first round in each of his first three minor leagues career. In his final career game as the Blue Jays' shortstop, Horn helped the team to the NL championship in 1940, with an average of.297\/.409\/.522. He then won a batting title with the Cardinals in 1947, going 9 for 22 (.564) with 10 home runs.In 1958, as the player who became a Hall of Famer, the Orioles acquired Horn from the St. Louis Cardinals. The Orioles would win the first and only championship in the major leagues prior to Horn's arrival.They won the 1957 pennant at the start of a short season. He was named the captain of the team the next year. Horn had a career.285\/.374\/.631 batting average with 2.0 sacks and 30 RBI's in the regular season. He had eight All-Star games, including the first time he had that many career All-Star games, with the Orioles. Horn's.282\/.372\/.556 batting average marked the third-highest single-season batting average in MLB history with a career-high.286.He played the last seven games this season after a two-week layoff due to his torn Achilles tendon. He played three additional games in late September.

{"id":4573,"ended":false,"length":655,"text":"Many of the suspected faulty welds were in Section Five of the pipeline construction project \u2014 the northernmost 200 miles ( 320 km ). This area also included two of the major problems encountered by the pipeline authorities in locating and bringing it into production. First, the welds were not secure enough to withstand the harsh heat while a second problem was that there was insufficient fuel left in the wellwater system.\n\nIn addition, the new system was constructed at the beginning of construction \u2014 the system has been running for 40 years. This was the first time this problem had been identified.\n\nThe National Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Research determined that \u201cthis process will lead to more severe fuel shortage if the pipeline is built with the existing existing system,\u201d because the fuel in the system is not as dense as it used to be. The analysis concluded that the current system was responsible for fueling most of the problem. And the NIER also determined that there was no evidence the project would lead to any of the problems noted in the article.\n\nWhat followed was a dramatic turnaround. The NIER conducted a thorough analysis of all the work done, using data and analysis of the pipeline system and workflows in the company\u2019s engineering department, as well as data and analysis of the existing pipeline technology. The analysis found that the current system was more expensive than the oil pipeline system, and that the new system was not working at all.\n\nThe analysis showed that this change in pipeline maintenance was a \u201csignal of failure,\u201d which prompted the NIER to conclude the existing system had at least 50% accuracy in both analysis and construction. The analysis found that the current system was in fact the reason for the temporary increase in fuel shortages.\n\nThis shift left the project \u201ccompletely and completely in the dark\u201d as it was conducted, leaving the NIER unable to determine which areas of the existing system were the cause of the fuel shortage.\n\nThe NIER is one of many federal agencies which must be accountable for assessing the progress of infrastructure projects, and is likely to be criticized by independent contractors. Many federal contractors believe it is inappropriate to assign special significance to projects with the specific purpose of reducing production costs through pipeline maintenance.\n\nThe work in the new pipeline system, and the existing system, must either be completed immediately or it must be completed with significant delay. Some federal contractors, such as ExxonMobil, have said that it cannot afford to work on the replacement of both existing equipment and maintenance facilities. This lack of confidence in completing the maintenance and repair works within six months puts the federal contractor\u2019s interest and economic viability at risk.\n\nThe new system is expected to arrive in the first half of 2015. In the years to come, the current system will be more complicated and expensive than the old system. Some are already in the field, and more will follow. Those who are interested in the long-term benefits of the new system should see the news stories of improvements ahead.\n\nIn the meantime, however, it is important to keep the eye on the next project, and to understand how, when, and what should be done before it takes the next step forward and begins planning for that final phase of the project.\n\nThe author would like to thank his brother, Frank, who is a special education attorney in the San Francisco office of the PEN\/Public Health Foundation.

{"id":1723,"ended":true,"length":657,"text":"H @ - @ Hour for the landing at Gold was set at 07 : 25 on King sector ( 50 minutes later than in the American landings, because of differences in the tide, the final stage of the landing is still at 11: 00 pm local time).\n\nSo what happened? It will take until a few hours before we can tell you, if anything, that it was the usual schedule \u2013 1-2 hours of the landing at the beginning of the US-Mexico border; a little longer if you want to see the exact time of day for the US-Mexico border crossing because the tide isn\u2019t exactly changing due to the high tide.\n\nAs for the other part (i.e. the other sections below the landing), because everything else is done as usual, as usual. After all, the water is at 50 degrees C at 7500m. The water level is between 4.6m and 4.88m (8500m is 2,000m and 30 metres below the US-Mexico border), and all the sand in the place must be put aside to avoid a tsunami event in any case.\n\nHow does all this work? So that means every time you want to go on a night trip, have a water bottle and a bucket where you can safely drink, wash, dry your clothes in the bathroom and get back to your apartment, you would have to wait for the time at gold to drop off all those stuff on a plane home? Well yeah of course, it\u2019s just like for many of the other sea-going types who just needed a little bit of privacy. When we get back to the US the next day, we\u2019ll be back at 7500m, and we should take the shuttle taxi back to Gold at 10am \u2013 but first you have to take a look at the sky, and then you have to drop off the rest of the things.\n\nFinally, we will talk about the sand of \u2018the lake\u2019 which is now surrounded by a small section of sand, and the water is rising rapidly, and so we have to wait until that tide comes. So it is now 11am (for the start at the entrance of the landing, of course) and you will have 2 hours to get there. If you are not already here before you will have to wait till it ends. However, if you do not already have your clothes, shoes, sandals or sandals ready to go or you have been going out a lot before, wait for the \u2018lake\u2019 to start rising, and then your best chance of getting there is if you can wait until late. In the moment, you may have thought you had the longest (or probably the shortest) stay at the airport before the tides, but we are only talking about 3km. So let\u2019s have a good guess at the length of the day and see the weather \u2013 do us all a favour and get over to the airport and wait a few minutes for the tide to stop.

{"id":2895,"ended":false,"length":620,"text":"There are six separate tournaments that the IBAF currently recognises as `` minor world championships ``. Of those, Australia has only participated in one senior tournament : the Intercontinental Cup. ( Australia is one of the eight major tournaments that have not yet competed a major ) -- and the world championships were held in 1999, while the U.S., Canada and Japan have competing.\n\n''In spite of the large number of top-tier tournaments competing at the time, none have ever successfully represented the United States in any major sport, and the U.S., Canada and Japan have never qualified for any tournament and are not playing competitive basketball. That means they won''t be able to compete at any of the major tournaments,'' said IBAF General Manager, Tom Mignola.\n\nMignola said those four championships have not won one in his 50-year history : \"I can say with certain certainty that winning a world title doesn't mean you should be in the finals.''\n\nAustralia had won three world championships in 2004, 2003 and 2006, all held at the Commonwealth Games.\n\n''It''s a sad state,'' said Australia''s top official for international basketball - Bob Cousy. ''Even the United States is losing the Olympic games as a result of the (cup). I don''t think it is in our national interest to get our players to compete.''\n\nJapan and the U.S. were at odds with each other over the qualification of both countries to compete at major tournaments.\n\nMignola said the only reason the Australians won didn''t qualify to compete in the world championships was that the U.S. played ''a lot better basketball than'' Australia.\n\n''Not the way Australia played'', Mignola said. ''Not the way Japan played,'' said Mignola. \"Their game was way better. But they won.''\n\nFellow Australian coach Scott Krawiec called the U.S. ''a big, strong team,'' which he said will help in avoiding the U.S. ''getting in any problems,'' he said.\n\nThe U.S. got a win over South Korea on Friday in Seoul, South Korea, and lost to the Philippines by a score of 1-0. The Philippines was playing in their first major tournament, the 2013 Olympics.\n\nJapan was ranked 1st with 13 Olympic medalists and 6th with a record of 47-3. In a tough game against South Korea, Japan had a field that included players like Masayuki Kawamoto, the team''s first-ever selection for the men's FIBA National Team and the first player to play in the same competition.\n\n''They played really tough, we let them get past the Koreans and came away with three wins,'' said Mignola. ''They\u00b4re an Olympic team as well.''\n\nIn a tough final match against the Philippines, the U.S. went on to beat the Philippines 1-0.\n\n''In an Olympic game, there are a couple of issues. At the end of the game, the referee just gave (the Filipino players'' a double-overtime lead), like I said the two-day Olympics were too important,'' said Mignola. ''The Philippines is going strong. It was just disappointing to lose to them.

{"id":1890,"ended":true,"length":653,"text":"As the annual dole grew larger the Easter distribution became increasingly popular. In 1808 a broadside featuring a woodcut of the twins and a brief history of their alleged story was sold outside the church. A book called \"The Three Sisters\" (Bridgeton & Co.] sold the book at $10,900 while a print version was issued in 1811, the same year as the \"A New Way to Die\" tour.\nThe sisters had never discussed raising money for charity. In 1823 they began speaking in front of the church at a public hearing to raise money and support the Church Society and help it rebuild.\nOn one occasion they were given $500 to use only for the use of the chapel. The brothers were surprised by the money and said it was a great tribute as though they never met them.\n\"Every one who has heard of the good old days, we are here to thank you for your kind intentions,\" the brothers said.\nThe sisters were the first black and brown women in the U.S. to attend a church in New York in the 1800s. In 1809 they founded the Sisters of Charity.\nIn 1824 the first annual annual Easter celebration was cancelled due to the weather. At the same time, in February 1830, the Sisters of Charity presented their \"Merry Christmas\" to the entire flock in a ceremony held in the church, where the congregation sang and enjoyed a meal. On the same day, the sisters were invited to a public house in Manhattan featuring a large replica of the church's cathedral.\nThe first annual parade in 1851 took place on September 20 at St. Boniface Church in Columbia, S.C.\nThe sisters were among the early immigrants who participated in the annual \"Praise Mary\" parade where the participants were asked to pray for the first time.\n\"Praise Mary\" is the most popular celebration of Advent.\nThe sisters were also involved with the local Baptist Convention and the U.S. Baptist Convention.\nAccording to the B.W.W.C. website, the sisters were \"an important religious organization in the area and in the local culture of Columbia. The mission of the sisters is to preserve the character and unity of America by bringing together people through the power of faith and prayer. The sisters' focus is to protect the Catholic faith and the unity of the Methodist faith.\"\nThey were honored with a \"A New Way to Die.\"\n\"We pray for the comfort of the victims of the Christmas tree incident and our prayers that all those victims in the same circumstances can be healed. Our hope is that Jesus returns on the day of His coming,\" the sisters wrote in a letter the next night.\nThe B.W.W.C. website lists \"the services for which the sisters prayed, including \"The Grace of God and the Mercy of Christ,\" as the event was expected to be a day of service.\nIn the mid 1920s, during the Cold War and the Great Depression, the sisters attended several church services but were unable to attend those religious conventions.\n\"We are in the midst of a new era,\" the sisters wrote in a letter the next year.\nThe Sisters were listed as a charity in 1993, but the charity received no gifts from any of their charitable organizations or sponsors.\nIn April 2021, the sisters will open a new location in New Jersey to be known as the Pops of Christ Church at 995 Broadway in

{"id":3125,"ended":false,"length":991,"text":"`` Detour `` received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Francis Dass of New Straits Times was positive toward the episode, calling it `` imaginative ``. IGN named it the seventh best episode of the year. \"\n\n`` Although critics praised the episode's story and its dramatic action, they felt it lacked its central themes of action, morality and heroism. As the episode was only one of the five episodes aired in the first nine months of the year, critics praised not only the actions of Jack (played by newcomer John Paul Smith, in his first role), but how the characters handled the threat to the town of Mollusca. \"''Some said '''J. Paul Smith's performance was more like that of a big fish'''' and ''''he was a great character who was very strong to them,''''' said one critic, comparing the episode to a \"J.Paul Smith'''' scene. ''The scenes they do in this episode are not really in the style of J.Paul's big fish'''' but that they were very enjoyable to witness. Other critics also applauded the episode, saying it was a \"stunning work''''. ''''We have no doubt that some will find it extremely entertaining''', said another, telling British website The Independent: '''Totally different atmosphere. They were both quite interesting and completely different from ''The J.Paul Smith'''''.\n\nFor the final episode, the BBC tried to bring in more television than previously, with ''\"The Mr. Smith'''' (2003, 2008a), ''The Men in Stockholm'''' (2004, 2005b) and ''The Mr. Smith'''' (2004, 2005a) as well.

{"id":2613,"ended":true,"length":672,"text":"Newton and Robert Boyle's approach to the mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the < unk > and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as the equivalent of the orthodox spirit. The first books of Richard Dawkins were written by \"newtonian\" writers (the first of whom is Stephen Waugh) in 1843, and their ideas were used \"to show that a new philosophical conception of physics could be accomplished by the practical methods of the natural sciences\". Later they began to use metaphysics, the philosophy of natural laws, as the answer to the classical principle and that of the natural law.\n\nAccording to some early thinkers, William de Gijs said (i) \"The principle that causes the movement in certain directions... is as old as nature itself. Nature cannot be fixed; nor has there always been a need to explain the movement in certain directions. Nor does the nature always have to be set apart in order for the natural movement to be taken in any direction, both to be natural and to have its own effects. The mind has no choice but to obey the principle.\"\n\nIn 1851, William A. Newton introduced the same idea to the philosophers, and wrote in 1857 : :\n\n\"The movement in which the natural law is the basis for the action in all things is called the movement in which all things are created. If it were possible, the movement would flow in various directions; but if this movement be only to one of the many modes of production and reproduction, which only exist to satisfy one cause, it may only flow in at least two modes. When the movement between a mode and the next or the last one is in the first mode it is the movement in which the first mode is established. If it were not possible, the first mode would be of only one thing to be developed. But if it were possible, the first mode can be maintained. When the movement between the first and the last of the three modes is in the first mode it will remain in this mode. If the movement in one of any of these modes is in the last it must be of all the same. In general this means three modes of production and reproduction: neither is to be attained through the process of production any more. The first mode is the best and only possible, the second is the best and only possible. If this way of production were at any level, all the other stages of production--the first which consists in the process of distribution of resources, the second part involved in production of resources, and the third part in the control thereof--would be of the same mode.\"\n\nThe work of Newton was followed by many different philosophical and mental work, and the work of Newton is most widely read today. In England he was born in 1811, and by 1870 was the sixth man in the world to write an English translation of the work.\n\nIn the mid 1920s Newton\u2019s name and personality began to appear in his publications.\n\n Newton\u2019s philosophy helped turn back the time of religion. At the age of 38, he married Julia Beacom, mother of his great-grandfather Abraham Newton, but the couple did not go to church together until they were 36. Newton died in 1832, and was buried in Newton Memorial Chapel, where he was succeeded by his daughter Julia Beacom, and a large collection of his books and other papers have

{"id":4549,"ended":true,"length":644,"text":"Ghana invited Du Bois to Africa to participate in their independence celebration in 1957, but he was unable to attend because the U.S. government had confiscated his passport in 1951. By 1960 \u2013 however the United States granted the former president his passport, he was given three months to surrender, and then he spent the next 30 years in exile. This means he had to leave the world in 1961 and was sent to Africa \u2013 where he was persecuted and deported; he lost his passport and lost the citizenship to his mother.\n\nGhana was also the recipient of the best known African achievement during the independence struggle: the African National Congress (ANC). That means \u201cInclusion in the African National Congress (ANC),\u201d since it was the party that had the largest share and was the one to have won the election to the first African president in 1956.\n\nThe government at that time was considering granting Du Bois the same rights as that offered to Martin Luther King Jr in the United States.\n\nIn 1957, in addition to Du Bois, the other African leaders who were also invited to include Du Bois were: Louis Pasteur, Thomas Pynchon and Louis Pasteur \u2013 all of whom had also been freed from prison in 1950, and were also considered key figures in the struggle for independence.\n\nDu Bois\u2019 independence was not only celebrated in the United States. In 1955 President Harry S. Truman made Du Bois ambassador to South Africa; he was also included as guest speaker of the \u201cAfrican National Congress\u201d in 1957. Later the African National Congress (ANC) was declared the winner and the party\u2019s leader was a former president of the Republic.\n\nDu Bois\u2019s wife, Ivana Du Bois, was also selected to be president of the ANC and was also appointed President of the United States to lead the country. These positions were also in the running for the presidency at the time.\n\nIn 1965, the ANC\u2019s leaders, who had been in power since 1950, decided to call off the independence celebration due to rising tensions among their members. In 1972, however, Du Bois had to return to Europe where he lived with relatives at the Riga Hotel in Amsterdam, while his wife Ivana was at work in Paris. They were given \u201ctwo months\u201d to return to Europe. Du Bois was not able to return at that time, and, because of his exile period, it was considered an appropriate time to celebrate his independence. This may have been the case for most of Du Bois\u2019s life.\n\nDu Bois died on August 18, 1976 at age 87 after an illness which had caused him to miss many important official events. While awaiting the burial at his residence in Paris he was able to visit Paris several times by phone and the public radio station AM2M as well as several museums.\n\nDu Bois was also an active member of the Jewish community and helped put together the Arab national newspaper PLO. He also served as a headliner of the \u201cArab Spring\u201d during the 1970s and 1980s and was active in the opposition before he was assassinated in 1985.

{"id":3605,"ended":false,"length":603,"text":"Salvia divinorum produces few viable seeds even when it does flower \u2014 no seeds have ever been observed on plants in the wild. For an unknown reason, pollen fertility is also comparatively reduced in the wild, suggesting that Salvia can tolerate very heavy sunlight much sooner than in the native species.\n\nPollen production is a sensitive matter, and in some tropical states, Salvia can grow up to 250% larger than the average grown wild crop, according to the researchers. The average plant has 1.1 liters of pollen per day compared to 1 liters for a wild crop like Salvia ginseng. In some tropical countries, for example, Salvia cultivars are only allowed to tolerate up to 100% of plant growth per year, while in certain regions, plants grow to as much as 500 to 600% more than the native plant has grown over the past decade.\n\nSince salvia can tolerate light much more than most fruit-bearing plants, it is an ideal fertilizer if Salvia is in need of high vitamin D, which may result in more robust resistance against all forms of malnutrition and other natural diseases.\n\nThe researchers report that, using data from the world\u2019s leading tropical fruit cultivation centers, Salvia\u2019s seeds have been able to survive much longer than native plants. They found that Salvia will grow in a more tolerant (and non-polluting) environment before it dies.\n\n\u2018In fact, we know that Salvia\u2019s seeds are of lower quality than native seedlings, but also produce greater yields per year than native seeds,\u2019 the authors write. \u2018This shows that Salvia can tolerate the effects of low vitamin D and other environmental factors, and the seeds produced will survive throughout the growing season.\n\n\u2018There is also a reason that this herbaceous plant can tolerate high amounts of sunlight, as it has more sunlight-resistant plants than native plants.\u2019\n\nSalvia can grow well in the tropics, but it also suffers from high nutrient content, which makes it less resistant to nutrient-disapplying factors.\n\nDying plants are usually in the same range of oxygen as they were in the wild, so salvia plants require oxygen, while plant native plants will not, meaning that it needs oxygen from other sources.\n\nThere are two questions: (1) Is Salvia a native plant or has it been developed by a unique plant family? And (2) How long has Salvia been producing this herbaceous shrub?\n\nThe researchers said that Salvia shrubs are much more susceptible to nutrient-disapplying factors such as moisture and soil moisture which the plant requires to survive.\n\n\u2018The plants that are produced most frequently are Salvia azulina da-fossilis, which grows between the tropics and the east of China (China\u2019s second-largest producer of the plant) and this plant family produces a good amount of nutrients,\u2019 they write. \u2018In addition, the plant\u2019s soil moisture content has been increased during

{"id":1951,"ended":false,"length":648,"text":"Over twenty skulls have been found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, elaborate bony crest atop its skull, which contained the elongate narial passages. The head bore on the top of its skull an enlarged eye, a round nose and rounded, rectangular head, which had a long central hole, as above. It had a large, thick skull that covered the entire face of the animal . Its large eye, the most prominent portion of its skull, had a curved, oval jaw, which was larger than its body. The nose had a large opening, above the center of its nose, which opened up to a large eye. Above the mouth also contained a protruding eye, which held a blackish scarred, triangular neck and was a light blue tooth. The bony nose had an enlarged eye, which covered the entire face of the animal. It had a large eye, which covered the entire head of the animal . The bony head had an enlarged eye  and was red, while the rest of the bone around its mouth had a yellowy black eye. The bone around the mouth was a blackish brown, or blackish color, which was wider and wider than the rest of the face of the animal.\n\nPolar bears\nLike all bears, P. elegans was a polar bear. However, as of the year 1680, it was no longer allowed to reproduce in captivity. P. elegans was not allowed to eat any other animal after mating with it. P. elegans was also only allowed to use its nose as a weapon to inflict pain on other bears that might come in contact with it. Many bears found P. elegans to pose as a threat to the grizzly and would fight to the death with their left teeth while moving into it. Some bears also made pogroms to try to kill P. elegans.\n\nFaction pets\nP. elegans, which was previously known as P. elegans, was the first mammal to use a hunting-type weapon. It did not have any specialized skills in killing animals, especially bears. The animal was no longer allowed to hunt or use any kind of hunting weapon, though it could use it to fight other bears. Eventually, P. elegans was cut off from the rest of the species, which included bears and wolves. One bear used a hunting knife to slice pogroms in half, and another used a shovel to slice a bone and bite it off. The bears were hunted and killed using a small knife. The bears themselves were slaughtered and the animals eaten. At that time, P. elegans was believed to have been able to eat about ten times as many animals as the other mammal species that were found. In comparison, P. elegans is thought to have only eaten one animal. This was a lot like the other mammals with a huge head. A lot of this meat was eaten by the bears during their lives and there were even more than one mammal species found in P. elegans. Each mammal also has a similar amount of meat. In addition to its meat, the bears also had a variety of weapons that were used against other bears, including spears and swords.

{"id":3297,"ended":false,"length":671,"text":"The modern route of US @ - @ 50 was created in 1976. This iteration of US @ - @ 50 has its origins in a dispute over the route of Interstate 70 in Philadelphia. The US @ - @ 50 was created in 1976. This iteration of US @ - @ 50 has its origins in a dispute over the route of Interstate 70 in Philadelphia. The # is an extension of the current route \u2013 i-90 in Houston \u2013 and serves the eastern portion of US 8.\n\nIn addition, Interstate 70, which runs from Houston and is now known as the Interstate-90 south\u2013western section of Southern California, is one of the busiest and longest route routes for trucks operating from the Midwest (i.e., the eastern half of the United States and the Pacific Ocean) as well as all those working near the San Francisco Bay Area. In recent years, however, several segments of I-70 have been demolished due to the construction of new highways along it. Interstate 70 is the only route available in most areas of US where access to the southbound freeway is not possible. I-70 is often criticized by California voters in 2006 for its lower speed or lack of space compared to Interstate 5 and I-70. In 2011, a federal court in Texas imposed a $3.8 billion fine on the city, but the US Justice Department subsequently rejected the action.\n\nBecause I-70 is the main highway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, it is more difficult for freeway transit riders to visit the site. Interstate 70 is also one of the closest traffic routes to other major US destinations. Because I-70 is also the main way-line to the city, it can often be difficult to enter and exit from the site. In the early 1970s, the U.S. Department of Transportation proposed that it should extend the route, while ensuring that it was open to truck traffic from all other major US airports (the San Francisco International Terminal and the Los Angeles International Airport, the Chicago International Terminal and the Washington Terminal). But it was still unclear how this would work.\n\nDespite all of this, there is an important economic opportunity for local truck traffic in the short term. In 2007, over 1 million trucks entered the US. Now, truck traffic through the US reaches 1.9 million trucks a year. Furthermore, truck traffic in the US contributes just over two percent of all traffic. However, there is a risk that the increase in traffic will not only increase truck rates, but also raise the cost of passenger transportation and the number of trucks involved. For instance, in 2012, I-70 saw a 30 percent increase in freight traffic, while traffic in US 8 increased from more than 1,200 trucks to 2,500 trucks.\n\nFinally, the US @ - @ 50 route is a major economic boon for small businesses like food and groceries. It is a transit route that runs north along I-70 while travelling through cities through the midwest. In addition to the economic benefits of the route, the route is also an educational value to students and those who are interested in participating in a variety of subjects during the busy summer months.\n\nNote: The views expressed were drawn from conversations with traffic officials and were not taken lightly and were not approved by the staff of this site.

{"id":4334,"ended":false,"length":662,"text":"After Houston received word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers to defend the Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30 men, one of them a lieutenant. The group was attacked by a group of men armed with rifles and pistols, but survived, while the gunmen retreated behind a hilltop, while another 20 died in an assault outside the chapel. The attack was blamed on Houston-area gangsters who shot and killed Santa Anna\u2019s son, Joseph, in April 2007. Santa Anna\u2019s son was stabbed to death on the grounds of the church.\nOn March 20, 2009, Santa Anna\u2019s deputy pastor announced that the Alamo was set to undergo renovations. The plan was not finalized until more than a week after the attack. After several months of debate in his chapel and with public officials, Bowie finally announced that the Alamo was to be rebuilt, though he said that the rebuild was an \u201cexciting time for the entire community\u201d. Santa Anna\u2019s church has seen significant restoration work over the years, but he wanted to maintain his historic character and \u201cmake sure that Santa Anna\u2019s vision for the church continues to be strong, despite being in danger of falling apart\u201d. It is estimated that the alamo is worth as much $15 million.\nBrent Anderson, a professor of history at Emory University says that Santa Anna was one of the first and most notable Catholic church buildings of the 21st century. He says Santa Anna was built to withstand modern times. Since the Alamo had survived the attack that killed the bishop, Anderson says the church was rebuilt to withstand the onslaught of violence from the gangsters who attacked Santa Anna and his son in 2007.\n\u201cA lot of these people said that this was a bad decision but to live the life of a city like SantaAnna is a tragedy,\u201d Anderson continues. \u201cBecause SantaAnna was constructed of wood and stone, the walls needed to be designed to withstand this kind of warfare. The doors that Santa Anna installed were made of aluminum and the doors would be made in the same way.\u201d\nBrent Anderson says he believes Santa Anna\u2019s architecture and history was based on the city\u2019s Christian faith and would \u201chave been the biggest source of pride\u201d in Santa Anna\u2019s history. Some of the original architecture, including those by the San Antonio artist George Roush, was taken after the Spanish Civil War, while others in the same style were taken after the French Revolution.\nWhile Anderson says the church still needs to be rebuilt and restored, there is an image of the Alamo that is still available on the wall that is similar to those worn by the city he grew up in. Anderson says that the building also has multiple windows in its historic form as well as several doors that were destroyed by fire. He says that the Alamo was torn down and replaced with a church that was torn down in 2015 but that it has not yet been properly resoled.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of people who went to see the building and wanted to see the Alamo but were disappointed and not disappointed with the exterior and so now that they\u2019re seeing the Alamo is going to have a huge, huge change,\u201d says

{"id":2048,"ended":true,"length":673,"text":"Europium is the most reactive rare earth element. It rapidly oxidizes in air, so that bulk oxidation of a centimeter @ - @ sized sample occurs within several days. Its reactivity with lithium ions [, t, b] is lower than most other metals. This reduces its susceptibility to ion transfer. It is thought that a small fraction of this rare-earth element is useful in an electrochemical process (chemical reactivity & oxidation).\n\nThis is why I have a special product called \"Inferium\", which I can make from very rare earth crystals. At the market today, if you buy this new product, you'll be able to make high-quality aluminum from only 0.004% by weight. The product is expected to cost around $2 million. Once you understand the product, you just need to figure out how you can make out of it a chemical that acts as a catalyst to a chemical oxidation reaction.\n\nSo here comes the question: how much is too little and too much will do? The answer is that there are very few times when too much or too little can destroy life. It's a long and tedious process. However, there are only a few times when too much or too little can damage life. Thus, there have been very few times that I have found that too much or too little harm will occur in the process. A rare earth type element will not react with oxygen at all, although this can occur in various metals. It's a very simple process and is thought to help a lot of people reduce harmful toxicities of mercury. But when you use too much or too little to produce that kind of rare earth (such as mercury), you'll also find harmful metals...\n\nA few metals are useful in the process of electrochemical oxidation. Some metals also have a significant amount of reactivity with oxygen to act as catalysts. When you use as much or as little as possible, like aluminum, it's important that you give these metals time to absorb the oxygen. When you're treating a metal that has been oxidized in air, it needs oxygen. If you don't give these metals time to absorb oxygen, which may be more expensive than using a little less oxygen, it can damage the electrolyte.\n\nI've found that it's actually more efficient and time-saving than cutting up an extra nickel into cubes. I've also found that all types of rare earth can oxidize well by themselves. Once it doesn't oxidize, and since they are all metals that are naturally oxidized by the natural oxidizing mechanism, they tend to stay oxidized by themselves. With rare earth, it's actually easier to oxidize the metal to prevent oxidization from happening.\n\nFinally, the most powerful oxidation catalyst for rare earth elements is. Aluminum isn't as effective as other rare earth metals in oxidizing the oxygen in an atmosphere. It oxidizes the oxygen and carbon dioxide in an atmosphere. This can be a good way to reduce dangerous and toxic toxicities of mercury. As an additional bonus, there are a couple of ways to oxidize aluminum. A rare earth type electrode has many active, highly reactive molecules. This can be used as an oxidizing chamber and the catalyst will react with carbon dioxide as oxygen gets absorbed.\n\nYou can see why I use rare earth element, and I've discovered that it's easy to make out of and a fun way to oxidize another rare earth type metal.

{"id":2932,"ended":false,"length":990,"text":"Genes with a most recent common ancestor, and thus a shared evolutionary ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are found [,,, ], or from an individual trait, or from one trait, or from a species composition, [,,,, ], or from a particular cell, [,,, ], [,, ] [,,,, ], or from a common gene. An isolated homolog has a common ancestor, and thus, a shared common ancestor, [,,, ] and a shared ancestry. A single gene from one homolog can have a shared ancestry. A shared common ancestor is similar to an isolated homolog, but the homolog is isolated in certain cells. In one sequence of homologs, the single gene for the single gene has multiple homologs \u2014 that is, all homologs have multiple homologs. In more than one sequence of homologs, the single gene for the single gene has both a common ancestor and a shared ancestry.\nConventions such as gene duplication, which can arise with repeated use of DNA for DNA or data for genome editing have evolved to overcome this common disadvantage. In addition, in the human genome, gene duplication is a common defect where duplication is observed, regardless of whether a single gene is used or not. More recently, an analysis of gene duplication data at a genetic level reveals that gene replacement can occur more easily than previously thought... While gene duplication of known species occurs more easily than previously thought, many of the other causes cause this disruption.\nWhat has been found to be the most common cause of a gene duplication disorder is the increase in the duplication in the gene itself. In the gene itself, the decrease in the protein structure of the protein is thought to occur at a specific point of function, when the protein's function becomes impaired, as noted in the [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ] and (mRNAs), [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ] lines, [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ; ]. Furthermore, in the [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ] lines and the (mRNA), [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ] lines and the (mRNA), [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.\nWhat is more, mutations associated with the gene function may allow the duplication in the gene itself, allowing it to be prevented through the addition of several mutations during time and a time period involved in the duplication. This discovery is of value to geneticists in understanding the genetic makeup of individuals with gene dysfunction.\nIn addition, the identification of the cause of a gene duplication disorder may serve as a paradigm for understanding the biology, and the role of gene duplication disorder in the pathology of gene dysfunction.\nThe term gene dysfunction may refer to a mutation, infection, or disease, or both. It may occur in cells, genes or tissues or may be a result of a disease or any other symptom of the condition. The term gene dysfunction may refer to a disorder in which abnormality of the gene result in loss of function\nGenes with an a most recent common ancestor, and thus a shared evolutionary ancestry, are known as homologs.

{"id":3147,"ended":false,"length":654,"text":"Ikuhiko Hata is a leading historian on the subject of the comfort women who served alongside the Japanese Army in the 1930s and 1940s and is credited with being the first individual to expose as much of Japanese women\u2019s experience as female Japanese women during the period of Japan's occupation and occupation of the islands, while being a key player in their study of Western Women's History and their influence in the current period.\nHata believes that the Japanese had the power to not only keep women out from their husbands, but also themselves from becoming single mothers and hence became very involved into and involved in their female and male counterparts in terms of their roles in military affairs and how they were treated by them and the military by the Japanese.\nDespite that, there are also certain qualities men possess in women who are considered as not only desirable but also desirable to be treated as well. Among them is an attention-oriented mind while being self-sufficient in his or her social responsibilities and in order for the women who served alongside women in the service to both men and women in the service to themselves, they need also to be very interested in doing so with a great interest in the women or men involved in their female and male counterparts.\nHata believes that it\u2019s also quite easy for female men to be distracted from the work that they are doing since many women in the service to men tend to get worked up and not spend much time with their husband. He also believes that many of these women and men do tend to get overwhelmed with their work because almost all of them also do not spend much time with their husbands which is usually the case for most of them. Some of Hata\u2019s female co-workers do tend to get worked up by the way they do their work and tend to end up becoming exhausted while doing their day by day work.\nHata believes that women who are considered to be extremely important to the service to others can become more important to themselves than men when given the opportunity to do so. He also encourages women who are considered to be very important to their husbands and be very involved in any activity that is being done as a part of their duties in the service.\n\u201cBy doing so women are at risk of getting distracted from what's really important to them. However, while the soldiers in front of them are typically much more interested in working and performing their responsibilities as women than men, they can always be distracted from their assigned tasks because they lack a desire to work for other people or to have someone else do any of their specific work for them.\n\u201cThe Japanese were able to control men from being in the military and therefore if you are male you are more prone to be distracted from your duties that's why the soldiers in front of you will usually be very interested in your work work, so it's important to be able to give them a lot of opportunities to do their thing with you.\u201d\nHata believes that it can also be considered a disadvantage that women are more interested than men when it comes to doing their job duties. However there are some aspects of these women that he believes might also be detrimental to them and therefore they should be the better choice for them thus they are the ones to pick and choose the right people which means they need to be very careful towards choosing men to work with.\nSource:

{"id":1795,"ended":false,"length":641,"text":"Conservationists concerned about the Everglades have been a vocal minority ever since Miami was a young city. South Florida's first and perhaps most enthusiastic naturalist was Charles Torrey Simpson, who retired from the university at the age of 62 after 25 years of teaching a conservation course around the Everglades. Torrey, who started working as a wildlife biologist back in 1976 out of the State University of Florida, did an interview with Miami-Dade Naturalist Laura Brown on the eve of her 75th birthday on July 31, 2017. Simpson was among the group of naturalist who came into contact with the Everglades.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\"This is our only place to watch the water,\" said Taylor Trestle, president of the Florida Conservation Association in 2000 because his group is lobbying for federal action as to the Everglades. \"There has been a long history of this happening. Most people thought a water source existed in Miami-Dade, but I don't think the water is actually that important in Florida or anywhere else.\"\n\nBut what is more important in Miami: the Everglades, which are the world's oldest surviving living mammals, or the Everglades?\n\nFor decades, the Everglades have been the world's wildest habitat. A group of Florida native scientists estimated the population of the Everglades at 2.6 million in 2008, an estimated figure far smaller than the national average.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe largest natural habitat in Florida is the Everglades National Forest, which is just five miles north of the island of Florida. Since 1993, Florida has recorded approximately 454 million animals (or over a third of the world's population) from these forests. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Everglades alone have more than 100 million animals, but most of this is from humans. The ecosystem is the brain of a vast industry.\n\n\"This can't be a theory,\" stated Trestle. \"Florida is the world's wildest area.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhile Florida has the second largest Everglade ecosystem in the world, it is far from alone. Other states, including California, are trying to preserve the Everglades as many people as possible, through the local government. However, while the effort is going on, Florida's government has faced major backlash over its controversial plans to remove 1,600 native bears from the natural ecosystem, and a series of lawsuits and environmental lawsuits since 2013.\n\nThe Everglades National Forest is a part of the National Park Service's Florida Wilderness Act. Over the last 30 years, the park has helped create one of the oldest and most spectacular natural areas in the world.\n\n\"If the Everglades are to survive, they need to be protected from bad weather,\" said David Smith, director of Florida's Department of Natural Resources, which runs the Everglades National Forest.\n\nIn the last several decades, the Everglades has seen an estimated 700 species of native bears, of which over 7 million have been removed. The Forest Service says removing the bears from the entire ecosystem is the most costly conservation program in the world.\n\n\"It is time we were all together and the U.S. government put all this

{"id":4897,"ended":true,"length":678,"text":"The Sunda slow loris may fit into the monogamous single male \/ single female social system, though are mainly known to be solitary. One study showed only 8 % of the species'solitans' were shysters, indicating female sexual preference for a male who would share the house with her partner, usually while being a complete stranger. There are other hypotheses, like that female sexual preference may be more widespread in female social groups, indicating male sexual orientation is less likely than male sexuality.\n\nIn addition, one study, from the University of California, San Diego, has speculated that female sexual preference and socialization in female social groups may be influenced by male physiological factors such as age, diet and exercise (i.e., the use of sex hormones).\n\nFor instance, although most female social groups are male-dominated, some female social groups tend to be more male-oriented. A study by a British psychiatrist suggested the \"gender fluid\" factor might be at work in male social groups and that women's physical or mental health is also at a higher risk (but not nearly all of the time).\n\n\"What women are interested in is the role or power of our emotions in our interactions and to what degree our relationships and sexual interactions can affect our social and emotional relationships,\" said study co-author Dr. Gaurabjit Nair.\n\nIn addition to this, Nair and his colleagues also analyzed gender, age and gender characteristics in 100 sex members (including female sexual preferences) who were randomly assigned to a sex group based on five criteria: gender, age, gender, education, education level and age (e.g., male, female) (i.e., male, female).\n\nDuring the study the participants were expected to have a sex member with a male sexual preference, either male or female, and a female sexual preference. Male members were expected to have sex as well as participate in social groups.\n\nThe participants also were expected to have less sexual attraction to another male member of the sex group. Male members were more likely to have less sexual interest in another male member of the sex group and lower their sexual attraction to another female member. In addition, they were less likely to have less sexual attraction to another female member of the sex group. However, while the results were slightly more consistent in females, they were not uniformly consistent in men. This suggests that men with lower gender preferences at sex level (as a proportion of male sexual preferences) tend to have an increased risk of experiencing sexual attraction to females and are involved in more sexual preference decisions. However, the study's authors speculate that the increased sexual orientation may be one or even more structural factors. In the latter case, they suggest that gender differences may be the reason that females perceive more sex as sexual attraction to males and males perceived less sexual attraction to females may also be the reason they perceive more attraction to females.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned findings, Nair's team will now follow up on their findings and develop a similar research model for female sexual affinity in sexual partners. This will provide a window into the differences in male-oriented decision-making and socialization in female social groups. This study is possible if the female sexuality and socialization characteristics associated with female sexual preference are examined in a peer-reviewed journal and is done as a cohort study, where

{"id":4543,"ended":false,"length":651,"text":"Du Bois opposed the U.S. intervention in World War II, particularly in the Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that the United States, the British and the Americans were all in a race to end Japan's imperialist rule and to seize power, while he believed that Japan was also in a race to regain independence from their former \"war father\" \u2013 the U.S.\nDuu Bois' main objective was the American invasion of North America and the establishment of the Japanese government and its powerful military organization. He also held extreme positions and stood by his side during the first World War, and held up his ground only through the U.S. military invasion.\nThe U.S. invasion and the war in Vietnam have become very serious disagreements. After the defeat of the Communist Party of China, he felt that U.S. involvement led to the downfall of China's imperial leadership, and that Japanese intervention in the Vietnam War and its subsequent subsequent defeat had put both the U.S. and Japan at increased risk of conflict.\nThe U.S. military intervention in Vietnam had been a major factor in his opposition to the U.S. intervention. In 1968 he was the chairman of the U.S. Military Comm Commission on the Vietnam War, and he served in as chair of the commission.\nDu Bois was a proponent of the U.S. intervention because he felt that Vietnam was out of control, while he said:\nVietnam was almost empty, but for many of the other causes that led to the outbreak of the war (including that of the U.S. support for the U.S. occupation of Vietnam), the Vietnamese government were actually trying to control the situation in order to prevent this from occurring again. While the situation in Vietnam was still so bad, the U.S. military intervention did create what is now the world's worst war in history, and the U.S. is now the world's biggest superpower.\"\nDuu Bois' views on the U.S. intervention and its importance in the war in Vietnam are very popular among Vietnamese. The U.S. invasion of North Vietnam, he said during the Vietnam War, caused the Vietnam War to be declared as a war against imperialism. Furthermore, he held up his stance on the war in Vietnam on the basis of his support for the U.S. intervention in the war in the Vietnam War. In spite of his strong opinion on the issue, he had very serious disagreements with the U.S. intervention in the war in Vietnam.\nDu Bois, a former military analyst who wrote several popular articles which include the article \"American and Communist Power in the Vietnam War\", is also a prominent Vietnam critic. In the article \"Says \"The American War\", Du Bois argues that the United States was an imperialist power responsible for the Vietnam War and its result.\nThe article argues that the war in Vietnam was unnecessary because the U.S. invasion has been an essential part of America's world policy in Vietnam. At the same time, he believes the war was unnecessary because, as the author states, the United States did not destroy or destroy countries during the Vietnam War which helped to save \"the war from

Humber's final time off the IL was on August 16, 2014.\n\nHumber began 2015 with a 2.38 ERA in 32 1\/3 innings pitched against the Boston Red Sox.  Humber ended the 2014 season with a 4.58 ERA in 27 1\/3 innings pitched against Red Sox pitchers.  Humber also posted a.279 on-base percentage over this span, but was hitting.279 in just 27 1\/3 innings pitched against the Tigers.\n\nAfter spending most of the 2014 season with Kansas City, Humber and the Tigers drafted him in the second round of the 2014 All-Star Game.

Humber was placed on the 15 day disabled list in January 2016, as a result of a knee injury that ended his season.

{"id":3602,"ended":false,"length":631,"text":"The genus name, Salvia, was first used by Pliny for a plant that was likely Salvia officinalis ( common sage ) and is derived from the Latin < unk >. The specific epithet \u2013 salvia \u2013 is pronounced sally in a synonym of \"spider\", a species of beetle, and is a word belonging to the genus < unk >.\n\nIn the U.S., the genus names, sometimes spelled as \"salvina\", often refers to the beetle family Salvia vulgaris, which is the most numerous genera of salve-eatworm in the world.\n\nDescription\nOn one side of the eye, two tiny pinches of white light are shown from green to yellowish brown, often showing orange or pink markings. The coloration on the outside of the eye can be similar to that of ordinary light, but usually is yellowish-orange. On the top of the eye, a black outline appears with dark streaks on the top half and brown and white streaks on the underside of the eye.\n\nDistribution\nThe genus salvina is found in various habitats with varying densities and densities or in some species of salvina and to some extent is endemic to tropical areas, particularly in tropical areas, like the western Pacific where native plants are found, but where most species are in danger of being lost. Several species of salvina have been discovered or have been isolated from other species that have been observed on this ground, notably the Japanese endemic Salvina niger and the Spanish native salvina niger.\n\nThe genus was isolated at the beginning of the 15th century between a few large cities, such as Paris and Venice. In the beginning it was the sole known locality of any kind.\n\nThe common name Salvia officinalis was originally made from a Japanese word meaning \"tree\", which means \"earth\". The name sally can be used for other species, but the genus salvina is only known for common sage (Common sage) which means common plant.\n\nThe species Salvina niger is endemic to the Americas, but can be found in the Western Pacific which mainly runs through Central America.\n\nThe species Salvina niger is often seen in Southeast Asia, while the species Salvina sideraciens occurs in northern Africa. Although its geographic location varies by region, it can be found in the Pacific and, because of climate and geographical location, cannot be confused with other tropical plants of this kind especially that are native to the area.\n\nCommon sage has strong association with native plant species that are found in southern Africa or Central America and, unlike native plants, which generally consist of a mixture of the two (sometimes the same), Salvina sideraciens occur in most parts of South America and have also originated in South America.\n\nThe species Salvina sideraciens and common sage are both native to Latin America and are present in the region, and are widely found in the Central American and North American regions in order to avoid the extinction of the native salvina species from the region.\n\nSpecies\n\nThe classification of Salvina sideraciens and the genus Salvina niger as \"Common sage\", as well as the name salvina or sally, is based on the similarity of both species to native plants, and the relative phylogenetic status between Salvina niger and common sage.

{"id":3533,"ended":true,"length":640,"text":"Acne is a very common problem, particularly during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum can contribute to sebum bleaching and\/or hair production in a much hotter environment.\n\nIn general, facial acne, while visible, has no obvious evidence of its related causes. Although it can be caused by an overuse of hormonal methods, it can also occur due to hormonal or genetic factors. For example, it can be caused by multiple exposure to testosterone and\/or progesterone during puberty, puberty-specific hormonal changes and\/or changes in facial skin colour and face shape.\n\nAcne is an extreme skin issue, but the risk of acne may be very low. In general, as mentioned earlier, acne is usually caused by some hormonal\/surgical treatments, but a variety of methods are available to correct the condition.\n\nIt can also be caused by a number of treatments that focus on changing body composition in areas containing both men and women.\n\nSome examples of specific cosmetic treatments include:\n\n\u00b7 Acne care products \u2013 these can be applied or dried for up to three weeks to remove dead wax spots, and can be applied over other areas\n\n\u00b7 Hair treatment (typically applied to the cheeks, upper legs, or eyebrows as well as to smooth out the areas of your skin )\n\n\u00b7 Skin removal treatments \u2013 this can include applying various types of eye creams, such as lotion and moisturising lotion\n\n\u00b7 Facial tourniquets \u2013 this can help correct and improve the appearance of your face\n\n\u00b7 Hair care products \u2013 this can be applied to remove dead wax spots, and can be applied over other areas\n\nOther techniques that may work effectively on acne such as:\n\n\u00b7 Dry shampoo\n\n\u00b7 Scouring\n\n\u00b7 Acne remover\n\n\u00b7 Ointment\n\n\u00b7 A range of different creams, facial treatments of all types\n\n\u00b7 A range of different hair care products\n\n\u00b7 Dry shampoo\n\n\u00b7 Ointment\n\n\u00b7 Hair treatment techniques\n\nOne of the main uses of moisturiser as a treatment is to rejuvenate the skin. A moisturiser, while often effective, will not eradicate acne so it is important to keep it away as much as possible. If you notice an itch or a dark or red area in your face or body, a massage can increase the chances of it happening. This is why many people suggest using a moisturiser, especially since the oil used for this will improve the skin tone and restore your skin tone.\n\nIf acne or damaged skin is not treated early the chances of it receding quickly after treatment may become the primary concern. A full-blown acne attack usually starts in early adolescence with one month notice and can last for several years. Some are less severe with a few weeks more notice than others and may result in an initial rash or breakage of the skin.\n\nIf you see an infection of any kind, such as a bacteria infection or a red patch of skin over the area where you are applying it you may need to take the appropriate precautions. This is another way to avoid the issue and the best way to treat it is to avoid using all of the remedies that are available today.\n\nFor most, acne is a small, sometimes debilitating condition that does not appear and is often caused by hormonal or genetic factors. Therefore, it is important to know about the causes of acne and the ways that the treatment of acne can be effective to manage it.","token_len":731,"entropy":[7.1201,3.6412,1.7734,4.41,3.3258,3.6287,2.8853,3.6668,4.1848,5.088,4.4346,5.2052,1.8672,1.502,2.1477,4.2093,0.0253,6.7836,0.1008,3.4321,1.6735,6.3531,0.0303,5.0746,1.044,5.1018,0.0042,4.318,4.1896,0.6621,2.6863,5.6382,1.2281,0.1541,0.0813,0.0044,2.609,4.3562,0.0478,4.5176,0.3284,9.8223,0.2129,1.686,4.8254,0.0005,5.1123,8.53,2.4744,4.7059,7.0721,7.6801,1.5323,0.6276,1.2809,0.0011,3.4144,3.8181,0.1296,5.9753,1.9481,4.3205,4.4797,7.2317,0.8906,3.6315,2.4071,2.0863,7.1479,0.4376,4.216,7.0805,3.529,0.4232,3.9027,2.0267,2.0049,0.7859,3.065,0.1115,3.3287,3.5084,3.4646,0.0919,4.7339,4.6053,0.6529,1.4385,1.6586,0.4379,2.6996,2.0243,0.0082,3.7311,4.1124,2.5668,0.834,0.5932,3.7302,0.635,0.0271,3.0269,0.8851,0.9283,0.8817,0.1127,5.7443,6.3694,0.2024,5.3207,2.2508,1.9107,0.0007,4.1635,0.7488,0.0001,2.4513,1.3601,1.2368,7.7264,2.5211,3.4373,2.9037,1.0592,2.9243,1.0346,0.0005,3.6787,0.1906,4.4291,2.7419,4.4166,3.1244,6.9939,1.5469,0.7195,0.8402,0.0002,5.0183,0.001,1.5415,3.2308,4.7171,4.0772,5.9718,1.7326,3.4598,3.1161,5.1134,0.7665,2.3581,3.7872,0.7118,3.2038,0.7428,0.6085,3.2458,2.143,0.0602,5.9689,3.2596,1.3006,0.1248,1.543,0.7909,3.1447,2.3886,0.0811,5.1822,3.7736,4.4889,5.662,1.3534,4.0839,1.317,1.6985,4.4235,4.4764,0.09,4.5857,1.797,0.9327,0.8651,3.4113,1.4283,0.9325,0.2661,1.0526,0.0002,4.0316,2.9429,1.342,0.4081,0.4906,0.076,2.1901,2.0552,0.002,6.5061,2.1039,6.1271,0.2219,3.9167,4.8095,1.8401,3.7667,5.9,6.7588,6.7696,3.7105,0.904,0.0133,0.5506,1.9059,0.0002,3.9226,4.7743,0.4516,5.6839,5.4606,0.6064,2.0583,0.728,0.2421,0.0002,6.4891,5.0859,0.0052,6.7386,1.7873,4.0283,3.8281,1.984,1.2706,2.5981,4.7381,5.2573,3.8106,3.2657,0.0029,2.8066,1.096,1.6178,1.9476,5.3163,8.5095,6.0601,1.664,3.08,1.9372,0.9565,1.011,3.383,4.9669,0.5625,6.0695,0.0002,0.0325,3.9259,3.9502,3.7611,6.2015,2.3,1.4834,1.1994,4.4647,0.9939,4.4562,4.9532,0.5349,3.1004,5.0773,4.793,1.0529,0.3861,2.1418,6.2023,2.0127,1.8633,4.3212,1.2654,4.6702,4.0574,8.2044,1.057,0.0004,0.6484,3.2301,5.7082,3.1945,1.296,2.7961,1.3311,2.2179,3.8506,6.1351,1.5422,0.007,5.9834,2.3689,0.0003,0.9254,3.5898,0.0024,6.2001,1.0553,1.929,3.4126,2.7333,3.0259,1.2258,1.3799,0.0002,0.2281,2.874,0.0226,6.8922,7.2629,0.0029,0.4016,0.6687,1.7433,0.7558,4.4273,4.7461,4.3824,4.6085,1.3723,0.9986,0.1043,2.1054,0.4743,1.3949,0.0002,0.3878,3.852,2.6053,0.4837,0.9944,1.3885,0.4729,1.2137,0.2637,0.9159,4.3244,1.6225,2.0843,1.0648,0.7152,1.4378,0.2562,0.058,0.028,0.1501,0.154,0.0117,0.3256,0.0002,4.5489,5.0944,1.999,1.5937,3.3585,5.821,3.3029,0.4221,6.7952,0.0023,0.9258,0.1358,0.0002,0.4274,5.375,2.8528,2.2448,0.0002,0.0339,5.7817,4.0048,1.7325,0.0002,0.1559,4.5371,0.0092,5.1097,0.4278,0.554,0.0002,0.4494,4.7275,1.2638,0.211,1.6202,0.0002,0.4231,5.4642,3.6272,0.0014,4.0925,3.862,0.0012,2.2924,3.9973,3.1552,7.0776,3.3874,0.8263,1.6738,0.0002,1.8812,3.9436,0.679,0.001,1.6183,3.4248,2.214,0.1583,0.6575,0.0002,1.2133,4.7908,1.6865,1.4026,0.0002,0.4261,2.9906,0.0042,0.0099,0.0637,0.0002,0.1852,3.673,2.7858,6.4165,0.8588,0.0002,5.8731,0.7744,0.036,2.5791,4.7807,0.3103,4.1831,1.6989,5.3483,0.8585,1.9663,1.7497,0.5694,7.5265,0.0037,0.8872,0.5186,1.2282,3.4136,2.5284,0.0285,3.5079,4.5313,3.7474,4.1644,0.8634,4.4965,1.8527,6.8188,1.5759,5.0495,1.2398,0.6529,1.3098,0.2769,3.4548,1.985,2.9878,6.201,0.832,0.0291,0.0223,0.4148,3.8917,0.7475,3.9701,3.1563,4.3319,1.1818,2.7721,4.9832,4.2876,3.9169,3.1844,2.7933,0.2895,0.9231,2.5611,2.8363,0.5533,3.7064,6.6787,1.8023,7.7368,0.5622,3.9967,0.2773,3.0046,3.8687,0.5783,3.4187,1.4205,3.1698,2.9982,1.5499,5.2846,1.0859,0.8781,1.6511,0.0392,3.8555,2.5186,5.7784,2.5772,4.341,3.8461,2.8368,1.8652,3.1104,5.1198,0.5316,2.189,2.8998,1.1279,4.8913,3.3672,2.1229,2.3011,0.4012,0.4315,0.0002,3.2802,3.2851,4.7273,7.6059,0.8684,0.8445,2.8164,3.126,5.0374,6.4782,3.3465,0.2536,1.5162,4.8673,0.6497,4.0582,5.8833,1.1054,3.4378,2.7447,6.1063,4.2908,1.7822,0.2856,3.425,5.9504,2.7776,0.8152,2.5861,4.9762,3.7542,3.0139,2.1306,4.148,1.6043,4.2903,5.6967,4.4084,7.4492,2.103,2.1364,0.4638,1.1293,1.8082,0.7935,0.3224,4.2306,7.0727,3.4641,0.8962,4.1274,1.6647,0.7215,1.3408,7.231,1.7606,3.8189,0.0544,2.9016,2.2459,4.9829,0.0226,3.5259,3.7982,3.7231,1.8436,5.6495,0.4025,1.3405,0.3838,0.9373,0.3756,0.8557,0.0002,2.7835,0.7989,3.554,2.4463,4.3777,3.6902,3.7369,0.5527,1.2459,2.2019,0.0044,1.5899,3.6222,2.9344,1.1371,1.5042,5.2174,5.602,2.9809,1.1093,5.617,0.9672,2.0876,2.8466,1.6271,1.5382,4.5435,2.9142,4.9626,1.4681,0.755,0.2169,2.9793,3.3229,3.1007,3.377,0.8392,3.325,1.4721,6.3149,2.594,0.9793,2.7121,2.5046,4.754,2.3567,4.2906,3.7521,0.8916,0.1986,3.4361,1.1024,0.1559,0.4721,1.9575,2.5118,5.2712,1.856,0.3649,5.4351,3.2332,1.1376,0.6069,4.5431,0.4809,0.4727,0.0002,3.8463,4.328,4.9216,1.7251,0.9919,1.9132,5.0083,1.1232,4.9125,4.3821,1.5015,1.4017,4.1426,0.0704,2.5266,4.9155,2.1044,2.4519,3.4746,0.1126,3.137,0.6978,0.1923,0.4477,0.2503,5.1947,0.241,1.5216,0.2566,0.6516,0.2284,3.6503,3.4644,1.1497,3.3048,0.5975,0.4055,1.2826,2.5368,3.6269,1.6915,3.4918,2.8486,4.068

{"id":2543,"ended":true,"length":703,"text":"There is little information about how and why Smart was released from asylum, but his daughter claimed : `` He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness' have not treated him with respect. I doubt if he has much to lose. He is the biggest brother we have, and he is a great man. ''\n\nSo, if I can't see your father now, I wonder if I did enough to prevent him from running away from the country. Maybe he will leave you in Canada next, but I don't know if that will hold me up if I leave.\n\nI have had one friend who became pregnant with two daughters. One was so little she didn't even want her birthright but had to be smuggled because she didn't understand why. She never asked them to marry her but one time at the age of 15 she was asked to marry her neighbour a few years after she came out of the country. Even when she was the one who brought that news, she didn't want to hear it.\n\nAlso, I remember a lot of his conversations with his son regarding the separation and all the things, or at least his attitude towards it. I think that some people would say he was the one being irresponsible and childish. Either that or you just want them to be happy for a while as well.\n\nI have been with my wife for six years now. We have lived almost identical lives, except one is pretty far and both are quite poor. For about 15 years I have been living in my own country, which most times is very far from me. My wife has never met or even met me and I have no idea what to do about my situation. She always says the way is always right, and the way will surely go on. Sometimes I wonder how it will all work out if she can stay with the family.\n\nThere are many issues which are difficult for me. When I was my kid I was extremely well respected by my parents for the best years of my life. I always knew how to survive and manage my own affairs. I never tried to hide my problems and problems. But when it came to dealing with myself, I became a little less prepared. Now I'm not sure what to do.\n\nI live in Mexico. I would be happier as a citizen if I was allowed to stay there. I have not met or met anybody except my son and a couple of his daughters. My current family consists mainly of my parents, brother and sister. My son is very young, and is very young, so I don't know what to do about him.\n\nAny advice? I would appreciate every little bit about this issue.\n\nIf the government gave me a permit to stay in Mexico then I would be happy. But how about if you gave me permission to stay in Mexico too? Do you think I would go to Mexico for that and not the other states? I\u2019ve lived in Mexico my whole life and I\u2019ve done all sorts of things in Mexico. I\u2019ve never met my boyfriend or my girlfriend, and the only people who seem to care about Mexico these days are my parents, and my mother who\u2019s not very good at talking about things.\n\nThe fact that I have been in Mexico since I was little is a blessing to me.

{"id":2774,"ended":true,"length":656,"text":"Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was one of the original founders of QAP, a newscast that aired between 1992 and 1997. He was attracted to the project by the promise of editorial and journalistic independence.Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez decided to become a journalist a few years later. He is the founding editor of RealJournalist, a daily that was co-founded by journalist and journalist Franco Franco and launched by Spanish newspaper El Nino.The goal of the project was to create a local newspaper with editorial and journalistic independence, and to help people around the world work with their work. The news channel is part of the RealJournalist, which is one of the main Spanish news channels.The goal was to create an outlet for all of the national news that had been broadcast on TV. In 1994, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the project was shut down at a time when the English language was a major part of the news media. In 2009, Garcia M\u00e1rquez decided to abandon that model and launch RealJournalist, a local newspaper focused around social events in Catalonia. In 2015, Garcia M\u00e1rquez started a campaign to release Spanish news channels such as RealJournalist, Real and RealJournalist. In January 2021, the Spanish public finally voted for the Spanish government's decision to remove them from the Spanish national news channel as part of the vote.In 2019, Garcia M\u00e1rquez was elected President of the Spanish Government to represent the electorate of Catalonia. In February 2020, he served as Deputy Prime Minister of Catalonia and Deputy Mayor for the municipality of Palencia. In March 2020, he received the first of four million votes (from the publics) by the government to remove the Spanish regional news channel RealJournalist.In November 2020, the Spanish government recognized Garcia M\u00e1rquez as head of RealJournalist, following the decision of the Spanish referendum. In early September 2020, the Spanish government approved the extension of the Spanish national broadcaster 'Real\" to the end of the year. In February 2021, it announced a decree to give the Spanish government the unilateral right to monitor any activity carried out by its own Spanish news channel.In October 2020, it was announced that Spain would be able to have the Spanish government appoint journalists as members of the local government. However, Spanish television is not an independent entity and does not have the right to restrict its news source either. After this announcement, Spain was at the start of a political transition. In October 2020, it was considered an appropriate time to stop the project due to the coronavirus in a way that allowed for the formation and creation of a new Spanish government. The president of the National Assembly decided to pass a resolution that the decision to end the Spanish national news channel RealJournalist is justified. The Spanish government then approved another referendum vote in January 2021 authorizing the implementation of the decree.Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez said in his speech: RealJournalist is not the last Spanish news channel to gain access to Facebook's content and it is important to let our political leaders know that this decision can save them their job of providing information. In order to preserve that right, it is crucial that we take the fight to the coronavirus and we must continue to live up to the people's pledge to save \"Real\", which continues to lead this country today.

{"id":4875,"ended":true,"length":647,"text":"Thomas Hardy described Portland as `` the peninsular carved by Time out of a single stone ``, and named it the Isle of Slingers and Isle of the Race in his Wessex novels ;'('') The British Isles were first incorporated into Canada during the 1790s, before the Second World War, and its economic strength has allowed it to flourish for much of the last half of the century. But now, years after the war ended, the Isle of Slingers may be the most ancient land in America, according to historian Mark O\u2019Neil.\n\nThe island has suffered a number and major environmental and climate challenges. That means that the traditional fishing port is now only allowed to keep up with the needs of local fishermen. This is where ocean currents and currents make the island hard to access. This is where the Isle of Slingers become a source of a variety of environmental and health problems. In 1995, the New York Times revealed that the island\u2019s drinking water is polluted because of the currents that swirl through the saltwater.\n\nSince the start of the century, there have been numerous warnings regarding the long-term implications of the sea currents and currents of the Atlantic. As one of the oldest and most biologically diverse coastal cities in America, the Isle of Slingers are the result. The Isle of Slingers is home to approximately 300 fishermen and their ships, as well as the largest marine food market in the United States.\n\nThe Isle of Slingers is known for \u201csea fishing\u201d, but also for its reputation for being very clean and healthy. The island is also home to one of the highest concentrations of coral reefs in the world. The Isle of Slingers is also the location of the nation\u2019s largest island-building business, \u201cMighty\u201d.\n\nHistorian Mark O\u2019Neil believes that the Isle of Slingers is the \u201cnew home\u201d for the Isle of Slingers \u201cin his research\u201d.\n\nWhen a study titled \u201cThe Isle of Slingers\u201d (\u201cthe Isle of Slingers in the United States\u201d) shows that the Isle of Sleders are the largest marine food market in the United States, the author recommends that it be examined further and re-exams whether its sustainability is of significance to the Island of Slingers.\n\n\u201cThe Isle of Slingers is an ancient world renowned for its stunning coral reefs and high yields of marine food exports. This area deserves an international research facility.\u201d\n\nWhile the Island of Slingers may not be as clean as the rest of the States today, it is still one of the oldest freshwater ecosystems in the world. While the Atlantic Ocean may remain cold, it is still a warm and wet place, containing sea water, which contains an annual crop of more than 40 billion tons of nutrients and an increasing amount of freshwater which needs to be fed and stored.\n\nWhile research done in the Caribbean and North America continues to reveal new insights into the ecology of marine life, they are also not going back to a single time before these regions formed.\n\nFor the years that have elapsed, the Isle of Slingers has been transformed from a place of natural and ecological beauty, with natural landscapes, cultural environments, fishing, tourism, and the economic sectors all being a major part of the Island\u2019s economic life. For its modern inhabitants, the island is perhaps the most important cultural and environmental capital in the island\u2019s history.","token_len":733,"entropy":[10.7677,7.9675,10.014,0.723,9.319,7.8044,9.102,6.0153,0.0191,14.2685,4.034,11.4682,7.2917,0.149,2.8313,5.273,3.6696,9.3878,3.7137,1.515,6.5065,1.8869,2.3647,6.8582,0.0968,4.9486,9.2991,3.5267,4.0923,4.3129,0.1051,3.0089,10.3604,3.848,3.7224,15.1747,0.2176,7.56,9.0296,8.2915,5.2458,9.2489,3.3237,3.0786,5.8381,2.1492,1.3958,5.5208,4.9271,0.5189,4.3005,3.6909,0.193,2.7527,2.2345,0.253,0.9343,4.6659,1.3024,4.9484,0.0553,0.0009,1.6654,0.9331,4.7126,6.1382,4.3753,3.6615,6.8956,0.8838,0.048,4.4773,2.7187,4.4338,0.1355,0.4027,1.86,2.2068,1.159,0.1254,2.7336,0.4742,4.7298,4.6787,1.0866,6.5248,0.3172,0.9857,3.3404,1.5729,0.2292,1.2797,4.3115,0.2036,0.2869,0.0301,0.0029,5.678,1.0759,2.6056,1.7857,6.2799,4.9581,0.6334,4.2834,0.9134,4.9011,0.0011,4.0346,4.808,5.0489,13.989,5.3343,11.3325,1.0912,2.5032,0.0057,2.1472,3.0276,2.4514,5.0628,2.2293,2.2646,10.085,5.6541,5.3196,2.0018,6.686,3.7154,1.8551,6.3155,3.8527,1.3469,1.6526,6.6134,4.7419,6.125,2.4509,2.1267,5.1574,6.9658,0.3738,5.7058,2.1291,0.2973,1.2456,4.6602,0.0404,3.9409,1.5583,0.9496,4.2295,2.0745,4.6837,7.6291,1.0865,2.0811,2.3204,6.0517,1.5976,2.0277,5.4778,0.2073,2.5409,0.9149,4.0448,1.5129,1.0871,1.1174,5.577,0.1215,0.3273,0.0078,0.0045,7.9895,1.4247,3.6665,0.0501,5.093,4.0418,0.0059,3.4596,1.5087,2.8999,1.3064,0.9042,3.4614,5.9289,0.2403,1.1569,5.3016,0.6135,0.3464,4.7743,0.5352,1.0994,1.6707,14.3832,1.7684,1.5609,5.828,0.1218,1.9329,2.4231,4.5803,0.3399,1.1437,6.1013,1.5567,5.841,2.1328,0.8013,5.735,1.0425,1.1184,1.8311,0.0003,5.1319,1.4228,4.1487,0.0283,0.2956,3.4549,0.1044,3.3233,0.6053,0.0397,2.6306,5.8385,4.871,0.4614,5.1648,0.3423,0.094,5.4335,0.2308,1.0426,4.0483,3.123,2.218,1.3006,2.6966,0.3066,3.0217,1.7303,3.978,3.913,1.6161,0.2955,4.3824,2.2116,0.4707,5.9902,1.7014,3.7291,3.9362,0.2824,1.8889,0.0803,0.814,1.3256,0.1245,0.0271,0.0103,0.0082,7.273,2.7538,6.397,3.3409,1.9639,4.6124,0.6696,0.0643,0.0191,0.0078,1.126,2.619,0.0089,4.5858,4.3562,7.3394,1.797,3.1253,5.0298,1.1067,2.831,0.0197,0.0067,2.7803,2.251,3.7164,5.9412,4.4095,0.207,0.4187,1.6553,0.0141,0.4247,1.8415,0.0003,1.6234,2.5738,0.1384,0.033,0.0115,0.0093,1.0063,4.357,0.6724,14.1814,5.1484,11.0673,2.5416,4.2247,6.8973,1.8301,3.3645,3.4232,0.6284,1.7205,4.5867,0.7923,2.2109,4.9292,3.2335,1.193,4.778,0.301,1.8081,2.7348,1.2559,1.2597,1.3355,0.007,3.5031,0.0159,0.1132,3.9423,2.2812,0.0028,6.5608,1.8197,0.3917,0.1832,0.5068,0.8353,1.5742,3.3306,0.2076,0.0202,0.0132,0.0057,0.8184,1.0314,2.4707,3.8924,0.4064,0.8017,4.9257,4.6592,1.097,0.5676,1.2317,5.4425,2.8738,1.4899,5.4385,0.6703,8.3105,0.6688,5.3288,6.7736,9.6305,4.5561,0.9345,1.0794,0.0003,6.1373,1.1801,1.8045,0.2457,0.0762,0.0043,0.1915,4.0603,0.2286,0.6623,1.1998,0.0589,0.0129,0.0122,0.009,1.0257,1.5889,10.2971,1.4893,4.9533,5.3294,1.6599,5.6515,1.8541,1.1821,3.9431,0.0589,0.9532,0.1756,0.0345,5.3827,0.5994,3.2814,4.2552,6.1148,4.8288,2.3158,0.723,1.6406,0.0002,5.5802,4.5642,5.4204,6.2358,3.6942,1.2474,1.6555,0.7273,0.037,0.0603,0.0112,0.0099,2.0022,0.9157,3.9367,6.5377,1.1659,3.5191,1.6369,0.0628,0.3618,0.0369,0.0286,3.3042,1.811,1.8943,0.0115,3.6835,2.9779,0.2448,7.6181,0.2855,0.7396,1.0571,0.1398,0.0193,5.4438,0.0061,4.962,0.9562,3.773,3.7111,0.3867,0.3639,0.1468,0.1561,0.8716,0.0038,0.3639,1.7969,5.4088,4.8361,0.692,2.9654,0.5017,6.04,1.7997,2.9361,4.6241,0.4949,1.1716,8.2399,7.0071,4.8074,3.9578,1.269,4.7786,5.1215,1.4696,0.8228,5.1288,2.6028,0.0548,0.0151,0.0049,0.5945,0.6529,0.0003,3.8085,0.4014,0.7892,0.7737,0.0211,0.0188,0.0266,0.008,0.8537,3.3794,3.6476,5.0199,5.9466,1.3524,0.2603,6.6442,4.8084,0.3292,1.4374,4.8658,7.4108,0.3591,4.0546,1.3632,7.9798,0.511,3.6301,5.2907,7.3501,3.2483,2.1626,4.8811,4.6113,1.8955,3.855,3.4011,0.7782,0.0003,5.3879,1.088,4.2799,0.0528,0.0136,0.0197,0.0053,2.735,1.29,0.5628,1.6595,3.5542,0.5518,1.5395,2.7687,0.0025,0.4032,6.1241,7.3598,0.0782,1.0117,0.7315,1.205,2.052,0.0119,0.0736,3.1178,3.6799,2.9197,0.3194,0.3637,0.6227,0.4329,4.5842,1.2915,5.773,0.7456,3.2211,5.3307,5.5485,1.214,2.0528,0.8652,1.4757,2.2047,3.8052,1.925,2.7824,0.9033,1.8779,6.203,6.0087,1.9785,2.4486,4.8716,4.4944,4.3055,6.2309,6.3361,0.1748,4.6364,0.0258,3.8506,2.1743,1.2452,0.1678,3.9542,1.7931,4.0315,5.5439,1.752,0.0022,4.7715,5.6122,5.8645,0.5067,0.0606,2.3615,3.431,3.3508,0.5114,1.0459,0.0002,3.9014,6.4779,6.6097,1.7541,0.5385,6.7666,2.1077,3.5419,0.4822,5.0223,0.9913,2.4612,3.9331,3.8492,0.6217,0.4508,5.0508,0.44,5.0318,1.3372,0.8307,5.505,1.028,1.9916,5.3357,4.6362,4.9958,0.9188,3.9493,3.2744,4.0447,4.8822,5.741,3.883,4.8816,0.7567,1.5498,0.0002,4.2303,2.1037,7.1216,2.03,1.1453,2.2639,3.0922,0.9989,1.6236,0.0354,0.0192,0.0305,0.0073,0.4072,1.1423,6.8387,2.0927,0.5912,3.0533,0.5792,4.9352,4.6487,4.2171,2.3872,2.9509,3.3689,5.1385,5.2881,2.0778,4.959,7.075,0.4801,5.0525,2.7826,3.095,0.5094,0.7008,2.989,5.0011,7.5138,3.8317,3.0579,4.7308,3.0796,1.1754,0.0323,0.8733,2.9776,3.9637,0.2846,0.0392,2.2811,2.1306,0.1346,5.2913,4.856,6.7675,3.3273,0.3155,0.885,1.7591,0.849,6.2874,0.5394,0.7986,2.1068,

{"id":1472,"ended":false,"length":678,"text":"Survivor Series 1992 was attended by 17 @, @ 500 fans, the same number as the previous year. It drew more fans than any of the following three Survivor Series event would have: [**] Survivor Series Series [Tuesday, March 13] 9:30 PM, Fox Sports 2 @ 5 PM, MSNBC @ 8 AM, CNN @ 5 PM, and NBC @ 11 AM. It was broadcasted in Spanish for those of you who didn't catch it live:\n\nThe winner of this year\u2019s Survivor Series will receive a set of 20 t-shirts and a shirt to wear.\n\nIt was an intense match, especially given how talented the cast of Survivor Series had been (one of which was the winner of The Bachelorette...) as well as their great chemistry.\n\nBut you can see why others liked Survivor Series... with their sense of humor and the humor that always comes with being cast in a completely different setting is always contagious... in addition to both a genuine connection and genuine love for their characters.\n\nSeth and Amy were clearly the two biggest stars out there for a reason. A lot of the excitement that followed this event was caused by the fact that the four of them would be featured in the first season of Survivor...\n\nThey will be featured in more than one episode of their new series, but before that you can say they were all so fun that they could totally win this year... right?\n\nThe reason why I decided to check out some of the other other amazing Survivor Series entrants who I enjoyed watching on television was that they always seemed to win a game. There didn't need to be a special moment between the two of them, and each of them made a unique Survivor situation look really special (though that was always the point of the show when you knew the end was near). If we would ever see one of them winning a game again, it was going to be with someone who was so excited to be there that it will have a special place in her heart and mind...\n\nThe best moment of the whole day was when Seth got called up to the team on The Bachelorette...\n\nAnd, while Seth was busy doing some makeup and making it look like he would be crowned as the most beautiful man alive, Amy was getting ready for a dress rehearsal on The Bachelorette...\n\nAll the way through the season, Amy made sure he was dressed right for that week's episode in a way that didn't detract from how they looked.\n\nAnd, yes, he did take some inspiration from Amy. In the episode about the competition against Colton, the two of them ended up making friends over a night out and he was able to find out more about her than anyone else had before.\n\nSo there you have it, one of the most dramatic Survivor Series episodes in history.\n\nBut now you want to know what you are getting into? What are you hoping for in Survivor Series? You can take a look. In the comments below, we'll be going through our favorite Survivor Series entry and making sure you are always getting the vibe that you need to be inspired by your teammates as well.

{"id":4348,"ended":false,"length":602,"text":"During the war RAF Uxbridge was tasked with despatching personnel to and from training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots flew the P-53, F-35 and P-16s into service.\n\nIn 1942, the squadron, along with a small squadron of RAF-controlled aerial targets, was deployed as a \"war mission force\" to the south of England and the north of the Midlands. By the summer 1940, the squadron was operational in both countries, reaching St Albans.\n\nAt its death, RAF Uxbridge was placed under a new name due to its involvement in two World War II campaigns: the Red Offensive from 1940 to 1943, and the Battle of London on 28 August 1943.\n\nOn 17 October 1947, it was transferred to the Royal Air Force and its successor squadron known as the Flying Fighter Squadron. In 1948, the squadron was disbanded under the direction of Lieutenant General Richard Pye (Retd.) and in 1959, it was transferred to the British Air Force.\n\nThe squadron's history and insignias can be found in a list of historic British fighter aircraft and aircraft of use, some of which date from the days between the RAF Uxbridge Command and the BAF (British Aircraft Manufacturer Associations). The most notable of these are the RAF BAF A12B, an aircraft originally known as the U.K. version of JT-5 fighter aircraft being developed by the RAF until 1946 and known as the BAF A9B, which was the first modern US-BAC aircraft ever created.\n\nOther aircraft from the squadron include a variant (later named the \"Flying Fighter Squadron\" from the 'Flying Bombers') of the A1.2-1 (A-1) and A2.2-2 (A-1B) which were intended as replacement fighters for Uruk-7. However, after World War II, the A1B was replaced by the BAF A3, which is designated the \"Flying Fighter Squadron\" due to its use alongside the BAF A10. This variant of A7 had been produced mainly as a prototype of the BAF A3.\n\nConsequences\nAn airman from the RAF Uxbridge command and command company took up a flight in 1946 and was immediately assigned to operational training courses with the RAF Uxbridge. He became a pilot in the squadron when the squadron was under an ongoing battle against Nazi-occupied France. He had a training in a French field which was supported by French airmen.\n\nAfter the war, he became a volunteer and served in various aircraft operations, including the F.N.V. fighter (Bartram Parsons), an Israeli F.N.V. fighter with two weapons systems developed at Uruk-7.\n\nHis squadron was awarded the Order of the British Empire (BOEB) in 1956 and in the following year he took part in the Battle of Britain, a battle that took place in Northern France where Uruk-7 had been used as a platform to destroy an enemy aircraft (or as the battle of France).

{"id":2409,"ended":true,"length":698,"text":"Bates placed importance on mental images, as he felt relaxation was the key to clarity of imagination as well as of actual sight. He claimed that one's poise could be gauged by seeing the colour on the horizon'. The first phase of our study revealed that one \"spurs the imagination of the mind, while the brain takes time off of the time to allow the mind to'spur the imagination of the mind'\". Although this paper is mostly devoted primarily towards mental images, the researchers did state that, if one feels relaxed, these are likely to happen very easily.\n\nThe research team described that relaxation and feeling of pleasure were both perceived as crucial physiological factors. They also said that the results showed that even when individuals seem relaxed, there are important physiological and psychological qualities associated with relaxation. The researchers noted that people can be relaxed all at once without feeling relaxed at all. As we all know, a good experience of relaxation can always be more than an experience of pleasure. If one is thinking that we will relax or feel pleasure, that there may be a more pleasant experience. The researchers noted that the results also showed that the feelings of pleasure were correlated with a good experience of relaxation. So, even when one feels relaxed, and when one feels pleasure, it may be like a good experience where relaxation is a major feature. However, in many people, their perceptions of pleasure are less clear than those of relaxation. The researchers explained that this lack of clear perception is due to being distracted when one is concentrating on a few subjects. They also mentioned that when people do not focus on one thing, it may become difficult to clear their head and therefore the experience of pleasure may be skewed towards the 'brain'.\n\n\"The research team also noted that, although the researchers emphasized the importance of relaxing, there are several ways for people too to achieve it. First, some people can relax during sleep, while other people may choose to relax during the night. However, they may also choose to relax during the day. Second, the researchers also noticed that, when a study is concluded, the researchers might recommend different methods to achieve their goals. In fact, people can use different methods to achieve one's goal. The researchers also showed that it is possible to achieve what the study indicates by doing one's best job in the new task and having a good quality of life\".\n\nThe authors also noted that when people engage in relaxing activities at home they increase their potential for achieving happiness and satisfaction. In a short period of time, they reported that relaxation had an excellent impact on their mental health. The research team also mentioned that happiness increased significantly when people were able to create one or two more work tasks. In the latter, they also stated that after relaxation activity, the researchers felt much better. In comparison, when people are relaxed, happiness increased in a matter of days. This was a clear indication that relaxing activities did have an important impact on the happiness and motivation of people. The researchers noted that the study shows that relaxing provides a great deal of motivation, and has also an additional benefit in terms of achieving satisfaction in a variety of subjects.\n\nAuthor : Jayashree Gopal, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor | Source: http:\/\/news.myhospitals.edu\/~gopal\/papers\/article_22_18_1801.pdf\n\nThis is a commentary provided by a University of Michigan research team and is free of charge.

{"id":4057,"ended":true,"length":705,"text":"In the nineteenth century, agriculture was the biggest industry in Ireland. In 1876, the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey to find who owned the most land \u2013 on the land between Dublin and Dublin, in a landscape that had been named, as it turned out,, \u201ca small country, of little use to the average person in Ireland.\u201d But now, in the nineteenth century, the country had lost the balance not only on the issue of land ownership, but also on agricultural land ownership.\n\nThis shift came into sharper focus when a group of young businessmen led by George FitzGerald became the lead architects of the new Irish government's agricultural reform law, which was introduced in Parliament in 1886. The law, called the Irish Farm Reform Act, passed to allow companies to be allowed to be allowed to take over farmland \u2014 and provide them with cash to help farmers cope with the harvest they face in times of drought and famine.\n\nThe law had previously required companies to pay back a fixed fee of 50 cent ($4) for all farming land they owned, which was often a long time. As part of its reform, the government introduced an annual cap on the amount of land you could receive, but this didn't cover agricultural land; rather, it included a range of agricultural land titles in return for a flat payment.\n\nThe farming industry was left reeling because it lost its market share because of the law's introduction. To this day, farmers who claim they're agriculturalists are almost constantly being harassed for taking over the land they own. Since the law was introduced in 1886, at least 15,000 landowners have lost their licences to crop since the law went into effect \u2014 and by the way, these include the landholders.\n\nThe farmers who have had their licences revoked have had their land titles restored but their land titles are still being used as cattle in the dairy industry \u2014 and for what reason? This isn't an area they could all agree on. Not to mention, it's still unclear how many Irish farmers are allowed to manage their cattle, and is likely to be much lower on the agricultural table in the next generation than it was 20 years ago.\n\nThe Irish government is far from alone. Even the most popular politicians seem to hate it. It's not that farm companies don't benefit from an extra tax on farmers. It's that they can afford it and they get a tax that they can't lose. In a democracy, the state and its institutions are obliged to abide by those laws in a way that can be seen as good or bad.\n\nIf the government really wanted to take agriculture and agriculture's future seriously \u2014 and if they wanted to see it grow into something bigger than that \u2014 it might want to focus on real-world economic challenges \u2014 like building a new pipeline between the Irish markets and the United States. And then look around the world for countries that have the experience and the talent to build a better and more prosperous future.\n\nWe hope this article has been helpful for those who are interested in taking the issues of agriculture and agriculture to the next level.

{"id":3757,"ended":true,"length":660,"text":"Throughout his lifetime, Saint @ - @ Just continued to work on books and essays about the meaning of the Revolution, but he did not survive to see any of them published.\n\nThe book The Revolution was published by HarperCollins in 2014 and was highly rated by reviewers including David O'Sullivan, Peter Jennings, Stephen Warkins Jr., and Mary Louise Anderson. The book was described as a \u201cbeautiful new text containing the essence of the Revolution and its revolutionary elements\u201d.\n\nIn 2016, Saint said that he would make a novel that would be based on the book and that he was currently working on one for HarperCollins and Penguin Random House. Saint said that he was working on another for HarperCollins that was titled The Revolution: A Story of Power and Courage. Saint said that he wasn\u2019t currently writing his next novel, but would likely write something with that title. Read more about the New York Times bestselling author here\n\nSaint has been a supporter and reader of the New York Times Book Review, which has awarded Saint more than 100 points of praise for his book The Revolution: A Story of Power and Courage. Read more about Saint here\n\nSaint has been a member of the American Academy for Dramatic Creative Writing (AADDC) for more than 20 years. AADDC was created in 1999 in honor of Saint. AADDC is an organization dedicated to the provision of creative leadership through writing, editing, writing, research, and performance. AADDC was founded in 1992 by Michael West, William J. Williams, Robert R. Brown, John C. C. Stearns Jr., and John H. S. Schmaltz.\n\nSaint is a proud member of the American Academy of Dramatic Creative Writing (AADDC) and had received honorary degrees in editing, editing, writing, and research, among others from the USA. He is currently the editor of A. A. Dramatic Creative Writing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a privilege to be part of this prestigious group of writers and actors who make so much life-changing storytelling happen in their own way, in the same way that so many great American writers have, at least during many years, focused on their own stories.\u201d Saint.\n\n\u201cFor me, the most exciting things about writing is that when you read something I\u2019m working on at the moment, and a piece of it comes to you, you know it\u2019s been going for a while and there is just something a little bit more\u2026 I love how you get to feel something that is alive and alive for you to be able to feel\u2026 the whole feeling you get when reading something, the way the characters are reacting \u2026 The whole feeling you get when reading something, the way you get to feel that it\u2019s alive and alive for you to be able to feel those emotions.\u201d Saint.\n\nSaint\u2019s book has over 50000 pages of research written on it. Saint hopes that his novel will make people think about the issues facing the world during the revolution, while also giving people who are interested in the issue a new perspective on the revolution.\n\n\u201cYou know you see that moment when you do some little research that you\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, that is interesting, but not the actual history of the revolution, and there is so much wrong with it.\u2019 But I\u2019ve always lived the meaning of the revolution.

{"id":2133,"ended":true,"length":662,"text":"Busch felt his painting skills could not compete with those of the Dutch masters. He regarded few of his paintings as finished, often stacking them one on top of the other in damp, damp, rainy weather, often bringing it into his workshop a month into the month, sometimes even a month late, to make them a reality. This was in time for the painting competition in St. Malachy de Montfort (1415), a 17th century church tower built not far from the Church of St. Mary\u2019s, where the St. Mary\u2019s is today located, but on the site of the Holy Ghost. That means \u201cIn the Holy Ghost.\u201d St. Mary\u2019s built this tower on the spot where St. Malachy\u2019s building on the corner of West and Middle Streets was built in 1637 and its current location was chosen carefully. By the time the castle was rebuilt in 1942, the building had been completely demolished, and the stables and the surrounding areas were finally built again. The church is now regarded as a worthy place for the church to stand, as well as a historic monument for the Church. A series of photos, some taken in the late 1960s and early 1970s, were taken at the castle and the parish where St. Malachy\u2019s is currently located.\n\nIn addition to his paintings, Busch is currently working at a number of other subjects, including artisans, as well as travel artists whose works have been exhibited at museums and galleries throughout the country, many of whom have remained close to their hometowns for generations. He has also taken the form of an installation at the Vereen Kees van de Vrouwen, a large, glass and stone sculpture by the artist Eert van de Wijn (1488\u20131659), which has been installed at the St. Malachy de Montfort church and on the grounds of St. John the Baptist Cathedral (1497\u20131665).\n\nAnother project which Busch now considers to be a priority is that of photography. At the moment, he is working on a series of short film short series. The series which has been shot over the last two years will be titled A Look Back at the Castle.\n\nBusch would like to add that although he and his wife, Annacole Busch (n\u00e9e Leerberg), have a lovely couple and their son, Patrick, were born a year after the castle was built, he and Annacole still remain very involved involved in the \u201chome\u201d life. \u201cWith Patrick, we keep the church very active for him, and I love making music together, which is my thing, so when the album of songs is done, I often write the music for him, it can be any song you want,\u201d he explained.\n\nTo add to this, Busch has the pleasure and motivation of being an active member of the \u201cThe Church of Love,\u201d a volunteer church of all sorts, and he can also be seen participating in a variety of special events. He has also found it advantageous to meet, as he has a good relationship with the local clergy and is well-known in the community which he helps to run.\n\nThe St. Malachy de Montfort church is situated, by the river, not far from the castle \u2013 two minutes from the heart of Amsterdam and two to four minutes from St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.

The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour ; the third and fourth sessions, on Monday and Wednesday, were spent between 2am and 11am, and three sessions on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It will be interesting to see whether they succeed in attracting spectators, if they do well and what impact the opening session will have on those of us who are looking forward to racing today.\n\nFifty-three laps of racing were played in Sunday and Sunday. It is important to note that the first and second practice sessions were held before the race Sunday evening and only two laps were played between Friday and Saturday. Sunday was held before the race Sunday evening and only three laps were played between Saturday and Sunday afternoon. This will have an effect on the race as there was no time to change practice. The second session was between 4am and 2am, but the third session was between 8am and 3am.\n\nRace organisers have announced a new race format, with more fast-paced practice sessions and shorter sessions to follow. The event will be held on Saturday, January 8th (12th, 5 pm to 6:30 pm at the Melbourne Speed Track).\n\nPacing Information\n\nThis feature is only available to active participants.

In the opening laps the teams were advised to accelerate into the centre of the track and avoid contact with the spectators. The teams ran three times in parallel circles on the first lap, before they ran the pace as expected in every second. The teams were also advised to speed up in this phase of the race and accelerate even further, and speed down in this phase of the race. The speed up pace was not recommended as the team knew that cars will speed up much faster than they will stop. In the final lap, the main race car was moved to the left to give the team time to cross the track before their car crossed the track and collided with the spectators.

{"id":2698,"ended":true,"length":680,"text":"During his first session in Congress, Jennings had a small portrait of himself made, which he later gave to Ann Gilmore Hay, the daughter of a prominent Charlestown politician, whom he considered one of the best politicians of the 20th century.\nIn his autobiography \"The Last Waltz of the Sixties: The Secret of Waverley White-Skelton\", Jennings wrote about \"the beauty of being White-Skelton\", and what makes him different from his father.\nJennings said, \"I'd been around the politics and I'd talked to my white-suited father and I'd never once heard of one of his great men as a politician. But I knew he was a man who got everything right. I had the greatest admiration because everything I wanted to do on issues was to help people. 'White-Skelton was the man who was ready to say 'we got away from the politics of the day' and that is what made him the person I am today\".\nDespite the small painting of himself made by Jennings in the Oval Office, the following day his name appeared in a draft of a bill that had been drafted using a picture of himself in front of and toasted in the front and on the back of the bill:\n\"You see I got everything right. My father went to school in Charlestown. I always had an ad in the paper saying how important it was for Charlestown to get good schoolies out of this country... My father was a teacher who got married... He'd always been able to make a woman out of a teacher... I had to sit down and think about how to win a game. There didn't need to be a game. I always stood up and said \"yes\" and made a woman out of a man.\"\nIt was at this point that many writers like Jennings had begun to suggest that white men were more likely to see the importance of winning. Jennings said, 'There were times I would sit with my husband for the first 10 minutes of a debate, then when we were done and the conversation was over, I'd stop for a while and start taking notes in the same way I use writing on maps. He always said it wasn't his job to write maps. 'Yes, you do. That is what we do best and we always say things like 'I like when you say 'we got away from politics.' 'Yes'.\"\nJennings' wife, Ann Gilmore Hay, described him as her \"most devoted wife and mother\".\nWhen she died in 1985, Jennings married his first wife, Janice Woodburn, daughter of former governor Ernest Woodburn. According to Jennings, the latter was the last black male governor in the nation (1904 to be exact) and the only African-American in the Senate (1943-1948). He was the first African-American governor in Indiana, according to the local historian David Oakes.\nJennings was appointed a member of the Georgia House of Delegates from 1941 to 1946, when he had served there. The bill, known as the Civil War Bishops Act, was passed along party lines, and the bill passed in June 1946 before becoming law.\nJennings and two-time Georgia Governor Jim Gafford, both of whom had recently died, were elected to the Georgia House of Delegates on consecutive terms in 1961 and 1964.\nHis wife, Ann, was also elected to the Georgia Senate as well. On April 15, 1962, she was the first woman elected President of the United States, her first since 1961.\nThis article was originally published on The

{"id":2259,"ended":true,"length":698,"text":"With few exceptions, any legal resident of the United States who is 18 years of age or older has the potential of becoming a contestant through Millionaire's audition process. Those ineligible include young people ages 19 to 30 years of age. Once he receives a first place offer, he or she can apply as a finalist. Once that offer is awarded, he or she can win an additional \"millionaire\" bonus (depending on age of the offer) if he or she reaches the \"winner\" level.\n\nAnyone over 18 years of age and has a certain amount of credit to his or her name on the application. Applicants must have a valid passport, valid work permit, identification number and residence (i.e., the place of residence where he or she was born or raised). They must have not only lived in the United States but has worked in various countries \u2014 including Australia, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n\nAccording to the IRS, people applying for the \"millionaire\" bonus will have to pay $10,000 in tax in addition to the amount of tax assessed on an application that day. The IRS says that the person qualifies using data mined by their employer, which means they should have the following information on their resume:\n\nA complete Social Security Number.\n\nA work permit,\n\nA driver's license, or both.\n\nA driver's permit.\n\nYour driver's license.\n\nYour residence permit.\n\nYour date of birth.\n\nYour driver's licence.\n\nEmployers only.\n\nFranchisees only.\n\nOther eligibility rules that might apply (like who earns the money the person earns):\n\nIndividuals are required to provide the name of each of the following:\n\nA job title, such as \"Executive Chef,\" \"Executive Producer,\" \"Director of Business Development,\" \"Director Director of Strategy,\" \"Chief Financial Officer,\" \"Director of Corporate Communication,\" or \"Assistant Chief Financial Officer\" on their resume.\n\nAn employee will have to give permission to her employer and the IRS to apply to her. If she or he is not given permission, the IRS will issue notices to the employer who may have an interest in applying to her. This may be done for any reason, and the company issuing the notice may be required to give the notice. If the notice is issued without permission, the IRS will issue a notice to the employer, including any exemptions listed above. In order to properly notify the employer, the IRS should first consult its filing clerk in a timely manner. The notice must be filed with the agency's Office of Personnel Management or may be submitted to the IRS. In the event of problems with file-keeping, the IRS may contact the Customer Service department for guidance. In many cases, it can be difficult to file a request for the extension of the notice, which takes an hour or more. A complaint will also be sent to an Office of Personnel Management which will likely issue an approval letter. The IRS will contact the client to discuss the matter with the client.\n\nTax information is provided on an online platform that the customer has access to, as the service is operated by the IRS and owned by the company and the provider may not provide information as permitted by law or the law.

{"id":1193,"ended":true,"length":692,"text":"In 1898 Hornung's mother died, aged 72 and he dedicated his next book, a series of short stories titled Some Persons Unknown, to her memory. Later that year Hornung and his mother divorced, the young Hornung was offered work in a publishing company by an old gentleman, a newspaper tycoon, who used a small amount of money in exchange for Hornung\u2019s children. Hornung thought this was unusual for an old man, who gave up running and lost the strength to lose weight. It was in 1898 that Hornung\u2019s best friend came into his support, a lawyer and poet, and was later named one of Hornung\u2019s best friends. Hornung had been working as a journalist for the newspaper but had lost his touch because his friend was often too rough to read to him. Hornung died one December at the age of 70 after a battle with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nIn his final poem, Hornung\u2019s Mother is the mother of his three children, two of whom were born in 1906 and 1914. The poem begins with a brief statement from his mother regarding the family situation. She writes, \u201cWe have no use, therefore, to complain in our old age.\u201d To her, Hornung writes,\n\n\u201cA little, my darling, is what we really need. Our little home is all I own, my home is where my heart is. Nothing to do but sleep; none but this lonely home is worth living; \u201d\n\nIn this, Hornung wrote of the difficulty in writing this poem which he felt had to be written at the beginning of his life and the beginning of his illness. The loss of his mother\u2019s presence is a profound and painful experience in a way that is not easily explained by any description. The words \u201cmy little home\u201d are written under a picture of a mother and daughter who can no longer write and cannot communicate.\n\nHe was also saddened by the fact that the poem was so close to her, even when she was in England. At first, Hornung wanted to be as close to his mother as possible. So he would use this poem as a means to put together ideas. Now, after several attempts at this, he finds himself struggling to figure out how to best express his feelings.\n\nThere is a profound misunderstanding about his thoughts about Hornung, but at the same time, a powerful poetic insight emerges when the poem is considered an introduction to the story of his life. Throughout, Hornung is a person who can be seen as deeply immersed in the family background and the life of the mother or even as completely immersed. In the opening passage, we see that the poem was written by him, while the end of his sentence is another passage where it is his mother\u2019s request to the poets that they allow Hornung\u2019s life to be a personal life.\n\nHornung said during his life that he had written poems about the family. But he did not always write about the families in order to express the sentiment. At the end of the poems, the poem has many emotions, and the author wanted to be more explicit in the whole poems, and the poems will not be able to be described as having a poetic connection.\n\nHornung died in 1907, and his last written poem was written shortly before his death. The poems, like some poems, are meant to have a strong sense of identity. The poems will be composed after the death of the poet, but in the end we can be more sure that they will stay with me, with

{"id":3086,"ended":false,"length":619,"text":"After completing 100 % Love ( 2011 ), Sukumar began working on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist because he felt that Mahesh had universal appeal. An incident in the film, when Mahesh was playing a female character, was one of the most embarrassing incident of his career, and while he has not appeared in any other movies, he has made an influence in the film industry.\nSukumar is also the first male actor to have a movie with a female lead. It is also the first Malayalam movie with a female lead.\nNow, if you are planning to watch Manusavaram for the first time then you need to prepare for the following. To start with, prepare the plot of Manusavaram because everything is in sequence as per the film plot. After the conclusion of the plot has been written, you need to carefully watch the scene with a good head of mind.\nWhen you know that there is no climax then you can choose from any number of options.

As for the last part of Manusavaram, I would recommend you to wait and watch Manusavaram as it is one of the first rom-coms that you will watch.\nIf you are more focused on the action, you will enjoy Manusavaram. If not, there is a third option that you should skip. If you want to watch Manusavaram, watch Manusavaram first instead.

The climax of the story revolves around Mahesh and is one of the best and most exciting scenes in the movie. Manusavaram is a romantic flick which can be loved and remembered by all, because of the romance between the main character\/ antagonist duo.\nIn the climax of Manusavaram, in a previous film, you might have noticed some problems in your movie that your friend found. It is because of these problems, which the director didn\u2019t plan after all the plot of Manusavaram was told. Therefore, before he went back back with Manusavaram, let the script of Manusavaram as written by Jyoti Kumar.\nThe reason why he didn\u2019t write Manusavaram even before it was written was because of the tension in the film. If there are some scenes in Manusavaram that you might like to watch, you cannot go wrong. Here\u2019s what you need to watch Manusavaram first.\nOn which you are looking for Manusavaram?

{"id":2954,"ended":true,"length":722,"text":"Since its broadcast, Vincent and the Doctor has received critical acclaim. Dave Golder of SFX magazine gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it `` a genuinely magical episode of television that not only combines the incredible talent of the Doctor with a touch of serious danger, but the Doctor is the ultimate, ultimate boss. It is an adventure in time, with the Doctor and their journey of escape, redemption and healing on display.''\n\nOne of the most controversial episodes ever on the American TV soap will leave one of the best-known stories in TV history intact. The episode has received critical acclaim and has appeared in multiple comic books, both popular and traditional, as well as critically acclaimed films.\n\nIn this week's episode, Doctor Who legend and cult TV icon Vincent Starr reviews the famous last line to the BBC Doctor Who serial \"There has never been a good time to go back\" before the Doctor returns from a world tour to Paris to take advantage of France's incredible state of the art medical and medical facilities. The line is clearly directed by Starr, who has known Vincent all his life and has admired him for his work in his TV work for years.\n\nIn what will be a riveting interview with the Doctor and Vincent Starr, Starr tells Starr:\n\nYou know I got to enjoy this, I went for a walk as well. Vincent was always the most pleasant person I knew. If it didn't bother you at all, you wouldn't know him. We both knew he loved to write stuff and it made him happy. When I wrote 'The Diary of a Dead Doctor,' I was completely at home watching that. When I was getting a bit bored by the show, [I] would write a 'Doctor Who' script and talk to him in a way that was funny, not just for the first few minutes, but so many years to come, and then talk to him. I think he liked getting to know me like that, and that made it special... The only time I could think about it is now, when I'm writing a book, and the first thing my wife is saying is, 'Darling, do you mind if we open one of those envelopes?' He says, 'Yeah. I like what you said. I'm gonna tell you what you wrote in that first line and you gotta leave the envelope. If you don't please me. If I don't please you then leave, and I will come back and read the book.''\n\nWhat made Vincent Starr so important to the story? He was in a really awful car accident, so he couldn't afford to get off the road. But for him to have these wonderful cars which he could use to drive around in and live the way he likes, then you can get his work done and he would look back with wonder as you read that first line... He was an amazing figure in an era when you couldn't leave the house. He had an extraordinary talent for writing and a very strong sense of purpose and his passion was very strong. As an artist, you really want to get to work.

{"id":1131,"ended":true,"length":694,"text":"Biographers Fraser and Navarro wrote that Eva Per\u00f3n has often been credited with gaining the right to vote for Argentine women. While Eva did make radio addresses in support of women's suffrage and in the United States, her speech was rarely heard, she was a strong feminist and advocated for the right of women to have the same rights of voting as their male counterparts. As the world is now used \"to suppress any debate on gender inequality and to deny the right to vote for women,\" Eva Per\u00f3n gained the right, and in the next decade, she became the best known Chilean female-led politician to achieve the office of parliament.\nOn March 20, 2009, Eva Per\u00f3n held a rally in Buenos Aires against the formation of the national government of the Chilean opposition and it was a call to \"bring to power not only people of color but all who have suffered and are at a critical stage in their lives\". On October 26, the \"Unidos\" petition was signed by 8 million people by demanding that President Ivan Duque be removed from office. The petition demanded that he be replaced by a woman leader and promised that he would give the women all the rights, protections and empowerment that they have, all while working to stop the anti-women movement. To this day, Eva Per\u00f3n remains one of the strongest voices on the issue.\nEva Per\u00f3n is more than just a political protest. She is a woman who has always stood up to oppression, sexism and discrimination. She has always been outspoken in her calling of feminism and equality. Eva Per\u00f3n knows that only women can achieve equality and this does not only mean the right to vote and free-speech, but a right to the right to live their own opinions. In the midst of the current coronavirus pandemic, Eva Per\u00f3n is actively working to raise awareness and encourage women to vote for her. The women who are most at risk of suffering from the pandemic are those who have fought like the rest against the coronavirus and will need to support Eva to achieve these rights now. Not only will Eva Per\u00f3n provide action to prevent the spread of the pandemic, she also intends to do all in the next few months to raise awareness among the women who have been most vulnerable during COVID-19.\nAs Eva Peron continues to push her way through the coronavirus pandemic, she is actively supporting the women who were affected with the virus. In just 6 days, Eva Per\u00f3n has collected over 6,000 signatures to raise money and awareness of important women for their rights and for their right to vote. The first step in her campaign is to get her followers to sign \"Unidos\" and \"Save Eva\", the petition demanding that he be removed from office.\nEva is also making videos promoting gender equality in the political arena, showing how women can vote by participating in the debates, working together to protect each other and supporting women. A recent release titled \"Aida\" released this week in which Eva talks about how she wanted to \"make people feel like they were part of the solution\". In the new video \"Aida\" Eva Per\u00f3n has written the following: \"No, I won't stop fighting for democracy\". \"I want to make everyone feel safe\", she continues, as she speaks.

{"id":2641,"ended":true,"length":666,"text":"While the Olympic Games have experienced tremendous growth in global media coverage since the 1984 Summer Olympics, the Paralympics have been unable to maintain a consistent international media presence. Television broadcasts of Paralympic events have not been able to meet the demand.\n\nThe Olympics was one of the most important sports events in the history of the sport. It was also the first major sporting event in the history of the Olympic Games. The Paralympics provided hundreds of millions of viewers for all 24 sporting events. And because the Paralympics are televised worldwide, these events provided tremendous excitement for the Paralympics, despite the fact that they were held on a cold winter morning.\n\nHere is an infographic that demonstrates the importance of the Paralympics to the Paralympics in terms of the growth in international press coverage.\n\nThe video above captures some of the important developments and stories impacting the Paralympics.\n\n1. The Paralympics have given more than $80 billion dollars in foreign currency (approximately $2.5 billion USD) to the Paralympics around the world. Paralympic organizers are very pleased that international financial media coverage has become so significant, as shown in the below photo.\n\nThis global financial crisis has been brought about by increased political uncertainty and political instability in the Middle East and Africa. The United States has expressed concern as well as concern over the humanitarian consequences of the Olympics as well as the lack of Olympic participation at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe ongoing economic crisis has also resulted in increased political and administrative pressures on the countries involved in the Olympic Games. However, as with most events, the athletes are not at risk from potential sanctions.\n\n2. The government in Russia has been in a tough position by the way of sanctions and the lack of a national Olympic council (Council of Europe) that allows the national Olympic committees to delegate their duties.\n\nThe Olympic Association has also suffered from a lack of resources for governance and oversight, and the lack of a unified national Olympic committee. Consequently, officials have decided to form a national Olympic council.\n\n3. The International Olympic Committee is actively considering whether to extend the contract that allowed Olympic athletes to win one of four World Games. It is an important development.\n\n4. The event itself, will not be held in Japan in 2020 due to coronavirus pandemic measures. If the IOC decides it can hold the event in Tokyo in 2020 and the games can still be held in Tokyo in 2021, which will be the year the pandemic crisis is over, there will be more clarity about which sports will be affected and where.\n\n5. With the Paralympic Games currently on hold, there will be less attention to the Paralympics when the Paralympics are being held. In comparison, sports coverage from the Olympics can be better impacted by the Paralympics by focusing on the events that are expected to be held more significantly than they are scheduled due to an increasing number of athletes and Paralympics participants.\n\nThese data suggest that the Paralympics will not be held where the public were able to see the sports they will watch from the ground level. The results of the Paralympics will thus reflect what has been achieved so far and thus will not create a negative impact on international media coverage.\n\nThe Paralympics will also provide a powerful measure of global popularity, since both the Japanese government and the Paralympics have been negatively affected by the pandemic situation. For its part, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has repeatedly stated that it will continue to abide by the Paralympics\u2019 contract with the country of

{"id":1073,"ended":false,"length":707,"text":"In 1965 and 1966, Dylan was touring with the Hawks \u2014 Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel, Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm, although Helm quit the group in late November 1966. Dylan, who had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis three months prior, recorded the song \"It Wasn't Easy\" at the London Concert Hall, while Hal played \"My Name Is Dylan\" (a song originally originally written by Hal). The opening performance drew a massive audience, with the crowd holding a record-breaking 8,200-seat venue at Wembley Stadium. The concert ended up being recorded and released by Led Zeppelin. That same year, Dylan wrote two songs for Led Zeppelin which were later remixed by Donny Brodek, guitarist for the band.\n\nLater work\n\nFollowing the first release of \"It Wasn't Easy\", a third solo album, with Hal, a third solo album, \"Hard to Get Away From\" and a final tour album, Dylan released his first solo album, \"Hard To Get Away From\" (1970) and recorded it for his third solo solo album, with Hal in 1975. Dylan, who had begun his final solo career as a solo player in the 1970s before he embarked on a post-apocalyptic tour, first released \"Ain't It Good\" (April 1973) which contained tracks from the album, including \"If That Were My Life\", \"The Great War\" and \"I Could Only See Me\". Dylan also recorded \"Ain't It Good\", \"What Kinda Feeling\", \"The Great Fireworks\", which peaked at No.\u00a023 at the British Grand Prix (June 1974), the United Kingdom's first major event in the 1970s. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at No.\u00a035 at the British Grand Prix in 1975.\n\nDylan's final solo solo album, \"Hard to Get Away From\" (1970) finished with a live, 12-track bonus album entitled \"Hard to Get Away From\" which included a number of songs Dylan had heard before, including the \"You Ain't A Lonely Old Man\" (1969) and \"Ain't It Good\", as well as songs such as \"The Great Great War\". The bonus record is released for a limited edition edition in the United Kingdom and Canada and includes an audio track for an extended version of \"It Wasn't Easy\", a song Dylan had recorded before he died of cancer in 1985. Also included in the bonus album is a track of both songs previously recorded, \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", \"When I Feel That\" (1972), entitled \"Carryin'. I'll Be Gone\" (\"Carrying\") and \"The Greatest Show In the World (1974)\" (\"Carrying\"). Dylan received another \"This is My Life\" solo album, \"Hard to Get Away From\" (1971), with Hal, as well as the release of \"Ain't It Good\", \"What Kinda Feeling\", \"The Great Fireworks\", \"If That Were My Life\" (1973), a new bonus album.

{"id":1863,"ended":true,"length":704,"text":"As early as the 18th century, fur trappers entered the extreme northern basin of the Missouri River in the hopes of finding populations of beaver and river otter, the sale of whose pelts were found at the bottom of the Missouri River. The first commercial settlement was established in 1851, and large numbers of them were gathered by way of an inland route, including upriver from Fort St. Louis. But there did not seem to be a settlement; the river was too dangerous for the fur merchants to leave. A second fur traders were established in St. Louis.\n\nThe fur trading community of the Missouri River, led by a native French lady who became pregnant by two fur traders, was quickly absorbed into the local farming industry. A fur trader had to turn her own property into a private store. With all those fur traders, the town of St. Louis was considered a thriving center for the fur trade. The fur traders remained in town for much of the 1860s and 1870s, and the stench of their activities was absorbed into St. Louis and the surrounding area.\n\nThe fur traders were known to have brought with them a great number of animals, or fur furters, which, like all great merchants in the Missouri and Iowa fur trade, were purchased without regard to how much profit they made. The fur traders were quite indifferent to the conditions of their traders. They did their best to keep their animals clean and dry, although the fur traders had learned nothing more out of this than that they were generally of decent health. They were constantly being harassed for many of the same reasons.\n\nThe fur traders had to make allowances both for the animals they had raised and for the animals they were sold to. The fur traders could not avoid the frequent wear and tear of their stock, which left them with little choice but to sell their fur off to the market. They were constantly taking part in all kinds of business and had no reason to doubt that they were well organized.\n\nThe fur traders had an excellent reputation in the region. They were well-known in their city, and the fur traders were well-acquainted with their history. They were constantly in the same company which led them to be recognized in the most popular newspapers. A great number of the fur traders were from the city. The fur traders used to offer their service as trade leaders in an open way. One of their greatest advantages with trading was that they could make allowances for a multitude of conditions and without any reliance on the fur traders.\n\nDuring this period much of the fur trade in St. Louis was very difficult. Over the next 30 years, however, the fur traders gained a strong and influential reputation. In the latter part of the 20th century, however, the fur traders also acquired new acquaintances. Some of the fur traders in the region had already begun their journey to the United States. Some are still there with a feeling of hope about the future.\n\nThese fur traders were successful in acquiring a large share of the fur trading market. But they did not always have the wealth that they needed.

{"id":2134,"ended":true,"length":610,"text":"Publisher Kaspar Braun, who commissioned Busch's first illustrations, had established the first workshop in Germany to use wood engraving. This letterpress printing technique was developed by English graphic artist Thomas Bewick, and was designed by Polish wood engraver Paul Klimkin. The design was based on a large-scale, geometric pattern made of wood, and in time it became the world's first wood engraver. The book was compiled in 1680, when Bewick and his colleagues began to develop a working system that incorporated wood engraving into this printing.\n\nThe book also featured a number and number of other illustrations of wood engravers, including those by the German german engraver Paul Klimkin.\n\nAfter The Bewick and Klimkin Story\n\nThe bibliography consists of several articles on Klimkin's wood engraving technique, which were included in a \"History of the New German Geography\" issue of The American Illustrator's Quarterly.\n\nAlthough Klimkin initially rejected the method of engraving, later he acknowledged it as an important method that could be employed in modern landscapes where the wood or engravings could be engraved and viewed directly in the print.\n\nAs part of his ongoing research into how the printing movement influenced the creation of the printmaking method in Germany in the 20th and 21st centuries, Braun began his research into the history of the printing technique in Germany.\n\nThe bibliography included such other examples of the engraving technique as this example of an illuminated piece of wood, and this example which featured a watermarking of both the wood (like an awning) and the engraving tool. Klimkin also contributed to a \"History of the New German Geography\" issue of The American Illustrator's Quarterly.\n\nKlimkin has also developed a technique for providing a more consistent and vivid image of wood engraving, including that done with the engraving tool.\n\nIn addition to this work, Bewick uses numerous other sources and images of wood engravers including an illustrated version of an illuminated piece of wood. The engraving tool shows three lines of a 3D printer. A 2x10\" piece of wood will look 2.67 times smaller than the size of the engager.\n\nOther examples of the engraving technique with Klimkin include this illustration (as a picture of a 3D printer made of glass) of a watermark of both a water and a wood (as a watermark of a 2.67x10\" piece of wood), and this illustration for a watermark of both a wood and the engraving tool that provides a more consistent (or complete) image of an illuminated wood.\n\nThis is a \"History of the New German Geography\" issue of The American Illustrator's Quarterly. The page about the bibliography includes the history of the engraving technique in order of its use, and also a list of other examples including an illustrated version of an illuminated watermark of both wood and the engraving tool that provides a more consistent (or complete) image of a 3D printer.\n\nThe book was compiled in 1680 which helped to develop \"the most accurate\" engraving system ever.

{"id":1054,"ended":true,"length":641,"text":"Four former England representatives have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame : Bill Beaumont, Martin Johnson, Jason Leonard and Wavell Wakefield. Seven former England internationals are also members of the inductees, who are expected to have an impact in the game for future generations.\n\nA former Test captain, Joe Root, has been inducted in the inductees. He is an All-England Club batsman and was featured in a number of England matches during his career.\n\n\u201cIn 1948, Joe Root played 18 Tests in the United Arab Emirates for England and during the 1951 Six Nations and the 1952 World Cup, Root was captain of England and played two Tests for England against New Zealand. One had been held by the British opposition, the other won because the opposition wanted to use them to their advantage.\u201d\n\nFormer New Zealand seamer, Colin Munster, has been inducted. \u201cAn outstanding New Zealand Test Test player who is in many ways the England Test captain of England will always have a special place in our hearts,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was known to have a strong affinity with New Zealand cricket and, as such, his time in the Indian and overseas Test matches is well known.\u201d\n\nVeteran cricketer, Ian Callaghan is also the former England skipper and former All-Ireland winner. \u201cI would like to congratulate Andrew Strauss for leading England into the World Test Championship final in 1948. He and Ian Callaghan are known for having a warm relationship with England, but also for having an outstanding understanding of the game which enables them to enjoy the most exhilarating sport in the world.\u201d\n\nFormer England test cricketer, Clive Palmer has been inducted in the Hall of Fame. \u201cI congratulate Darren Hall on his induction into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. Former England Test batsman, Wayne Parnell is a fantastic example of how the game can be changed when you become a better player with time,\u201d said Palmer.\n\nFormer test bowler, John Hoggard, is also being inducted. \u201cI hope that many of you who had not heard about John Hoggard may find some enjoyment during this award show,\u201d said Hoggard. \u201cI am thrilled that he has been inducted into the Hall of Fame.\u201d\n\nFormer Australian batsman, Cameron Stander, is inducted into the Hall of Fame. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame,\u201d said Stander. \u201cIt is a privilege to have such a great sport to play here, and I hope the many fans who have followed my career know that I am a real person.\u201d\n\nFormer Australian cricketer, David Warner has been inducted. He is a former Australian captain and an outstanding player. \u201cDavid Warner and David Fifita were the three world captains who played in Australia's first Test team against England in London, but were unable to achieve success there.\u201d\n\nFormer New Zealand cricketer, Stuart Broad, has been inducted. \u201cI have been surprised by how many former players who have not played for England are selected as Hall of Fame members.

{"id":4993,"ended":false,"length":650,"text":"Following Pitt's death in January 1806, Wilberforce began to collaborate more with the Whigs, especially the abolitionists. He gave general support to the Grenville \u2013 Fox administration, which brought more violence to the town. As soon as he was removed he began a long and dangerous occupation, including raids on Fox, causing injuries and a complete breakdown of their offices. The British government supported the Grenfell Tower Massacre (1918)  for some time, but the government was powerless not to arrest the terrorist organisation. However, in 1918, Wilberforce suffered numerous setbacks.\n\nAt one point, Winston Wilberforce was placed under a secret police station. On October 3, 1918 Winston Wilberforce had left the station after several incidents of violence, but the London police and the Secret Police made a formal complaint. This complaint was then forwarded to the Foreign Secretary, and Wilberforce was arrested. The official complaint led to the arrest of Charles Wilberforce, but his case was rejected due to the lack of evidence in court or because both Wilberforce and the Foreign Secretary felt unable to defend themselves against the lawlessness that followed. The British government eventually agreed to allow Wilberforce to remain in the same jail. Wilberforce was ordered to receive the full British Treasury grant. Wilberforce's case was reopened in the United States in February 1917 as part of the US Congress' Special Investigation into the British Prisoner of War.\n\nIn April 1917, Wilberforce was again charged with criminal activity and served a few years in prison. He was released in December of 1919. On 6 August 1919 Wilberforce received a letter from the American government condemning his arrest and the subsequent murder. He was released from prison in early 1926, and the British Army sent him to the French camp where he was kept until April 1926, but he was still held for some time. On 26 November 1918, a British Army officer in the French camp reported about Wilberforce's arrest and the murder. Wilberforce had left France for the French camp in April 1926. At this time, Wilberforce had lived in Paris, and France did not accept his return.\n\nIn the same year, another British prisoner of war, Louis Armstrong, was apprehended by French prisoners of war. He was released from prison on 22 October 1926. Wilberforce returned to France on 14 October 1927 and had been living at Les Sibilit\u00e9es at the Sainte-Pierre commune in the Gneuilly-sur-Seine region for some time.\n\nThe next year Wilberforce was transferred to Stade-sur-Ypres, where he served for 18 months and was imprisoned there for the rest of the 1930s. His incarceration was the last time that Wilberforce was imprisoned for a total of nine years.\n\nIn 1946, Wilberforce was given a pardon, which was subsequently granted. In 1968, the British Embassy in Paris announced an agreement with the Liberation Army of France over the release of Wilberforce from France. The French government decided not to pardon Wilberforce, claiming that he had become an enemy of the French government and therefore cannot be charged with any terrorist offence. Wilberforce became the first American detainee to go to jail while facing espionage charges. On 11 August 1969, Wilberforce was admitted as a prisoner of war (POW) under the New American Prisoners of War and POW Act. On 10 January 1970, Wilberforce was imprisoned again until his death. However, after the release of the POW Act in 1970, Wilberforce went back to France, where he remained until his

{"id":2126,"ended":false,"length":658,"text":"Increasing economic success allowed Busch to visit Wiedensahl more frequently. Busch had decided to leave Munich, as only few relatives lived there, and the artists'association was temporarily disbanded. In May 1945, Busch had moved to New Jersey, where a new home had been built, and Busch spent considerable time working while he was away. There he met Albert, the owner of an oil painting studio, Busch being the only official employee of the studio. Busch also came to see the wife of Busch's manager, and she worked at this studio.\n\nAt one point, Busch and Albert appeared in one of Busch's paintings, and Albert went to meet Busch's wife. One day Busch tells the story of Albert, and about how his grandfather went to meet them to talk to them. Busch then enters into his mother's arms at a table, and tells Albert how a \"friend of Albert's\" grandmother had brought him to France. Albert is able to tell that Busch was inspired by both of his grandfather's visits to Paris. Albert tells that Busch went to see his grandfather, where he was told that Busch lived in New York, Paris, and New Jersey. They were traveling from France to the United States, and Albert went to see his grandfather in New Jersey, where Busch bought a house in which Busch lived. Albert would later receive a gift from Busch related to the marriage of Busch and Busch. Busch writes that he and Albert were so engrossed in their love for each other that they both fell out of love.\n\nAlbert later went on to visit the family in New Jersey, where the two stayed in their own home. In the beginning Albert visited the family in Philadelphia, and Busch went to visit his stepson, Busch. Albert also made many friends with Busch. Albert left Pennsylvania early to arrive in New Jersey on his own. Albert returned home early, and began working in the oil painting studio.\n\nIn 1945, Albert married a German girl, Eva Berg. During this time, Busch and Busch went to visit their stepson, who in the same year had emigrated to France. He left South Africa during this time to work as a painter. Busch was soon working in Paris, where Busch and his wife, Eva Berg, lived.\n\nAt least 1,600 paintings were exhibited at the Sistine Chapel, including many by Busch and Eva Berg. This work made a comeback after Busch broke away from Johannesburg in 1947 and moved to Paris, where Busch and Busch's daughter, Eva Berg, became his partners and patrons. In 1960 the Sistine Chapel moved to Bishopsgate, which became Busch's hometown. In his years in Paris he became a patron of Parisian artists, who also painted large-scale works, which was an annual occasion around the city.\n\nIn the mid 1920s Busch and Busch moved to Paris and lived there his whole life. Busch died in Paris in 1957, aged 84, in a hospital in Paris, after having suffered from the illness of COVID-19 infection before he was declared coronial dead.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBook

{"id":2150,"ended":true,"length":702,"text":"When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about 71 % hydrogen and 27 % helium, as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements.\nEach star, like a mirror itself, forms a massive mass that can be pulled by light, and is known as a \u201cmass of matter\u201d (or \u201cmass\u201d).\nIn the current Milky Way galaxy, more than 2 million stars are said to be formed \u2014 the mass of 1.1 billion stars. This mass is the mass of water.\nThis is because the sun, because by the mass of matter, it can be pulled by light, as is the case with any light. To explain this, stars are called nucleophores and protons.\nThese are the protons that are present in the Milky Way galaxy.\nOne of the most recent known stars we see is the galaxy called galaxy G20.\nAccording to our own calculations, the Milky Way is the size of England and Belgium. So it is the size of England and Belgium. That\u2019s because there is no star in the Milky Way galaxy.\nHowever, it does not matter what the size of England, Belgium or the Milky Way is. The size of England and Belgium is how much oxygen you are allowed to use, and whether you will use it or not.\nSo this is an important figure. If it is too small, the stars will not form in the Milky Way and therefore they will not form in the Milky Way, because this mass of matter will not transfer into the atmosphere.\nThe star G2 is also the size of the Milky Way galaxy and the diameter of its star. The Milky Way is about the size of the British Virgin Islands and the size of British Columbia. They also have a size of the United Kingdom.\nAs a matter of fact, the Milky Way galaxies all have a mass of about 10 per cent of the mass of the Milky Way, because they are of \u201cmass\u201d (or liquid) matter.\nWhat does matter have in common with hydrogen and helium?\nHence, hydrogen is the energy that is in the same mass which oxygen is.\nHence, helium is the mass of hydrogen, helium is the amount of oxygen that is present in the same mass and oxygen is the amount of oxygen in the same mass.\nAt least 1 million times more helium than helium contains.\nThis, because helium makes a giant explosion, which will release the plasma and energy of both atoms and gas, and it will make it impossible to get rid of helium or hydrogen.\nTherefore, helium, which is one of the main resources of the universe, absorbs about 6 times as much energy as helium.\nHence, helium provides an electric effect which is very similar to hydrogen.\nHow has the \u2018Mouth of the Universe\u2019 reached an agreement with the stars about the mass and duration of stars?\nOne day in the galaxy Jovian and it is located in the Milky Way galaxy, it has already reached an agreement with the stars that has made it the smallest galaxy in the universe.\nSo today, it is the largest galaxy in the Universe, and the largest star in the universe will reach an agreement with the stars.\nWe are now in the process of making these two great stars, and we know we will create a new galaxy \u2013 called Milky Way \u2013 by moving away from our galaxy (which is very small).\nIt\u2019s still an extremely important galaxy because it will have a wide area. Now we are on to the future of stars.\nWe can start building a new world by moving closer our galaxy.","token_len":747,"entropy":[10.5469,4.9718,1.5103,1.1893,8.4917,7.5136,0.0025,1.7388,4.4186,1.6684,6.4837,0.1432,4.2256,6.7443,6.7339,3.5984,1.0301,4.5355,0.0364,0.2578,1.2729,4.2256,4.1217,0.6141,3.8935,5.8171,3.6841,1.6738,5.8455,1.2758,0.2181,6.5594,0.7811,1.1318,2.6025,13.6462,0.9957,3.5862,3.7335,2.394,6.1731,8.5204,0.0676,4.5851,1.802,5.095,4.7219,2.9893,2.6619,1.158,5.249,2.8947,4.0479,2.6332,2.0708,2.9545,4.1199,0.2181,0.721,12.277,8.0611,5.2225,2.8899,4.8301,3.4091,7.8463,2.4843,3.6422,2.751,1.1268,1.3143,5.4739,1.0241,2.7868,2.1466,2.7388,1.3618,4.7904,3.5537,0.0013,0.2662,0.2962,5.4067,0.2821,3.5774,2.9652,0.3383,1.0853,7.3338,0.0022,1.2135,2.664,5.9156,3.2454,4.0732,0.2062,3.5377,0.8745,3.0815,0.8798,0.7275,1.7186,2.7974,2.6865,0.895,3.1056,2.3495,0.1381,6.1108,2.515,1.0152,3.128,2.2972,2.7094,1.4441,4.5066,2.8561,5.8888,9.1527,2.6209,4.6658,0.2054,4.0182,0.8976,2.2708,2.1918,2.1057,1.5166,0.8414,0.6861,2.122,3.2223,3.6559,1.1258,0.1629,0.7571,4.1118,3.8543,1.6605,5.4021,4.4209,0.9843,0.7442,5.2517,1.496,3.3462,6.1339,7.1917,2.0389,3.3554,4.897,0.1162,2.6728,1.0175,4.282,2.497,1.4734,3.4427,0.0039,0.7455,1.9922,3.6423,0.2414,0.693,2.7078,0.0008,0.6616,0.7286,1.2766,4.8567,0.5992,0.2638,1.6753,5.1114,4.2509,1.1344,6.2259,2.1034,0.9243,1.6794,4.3337,5.2339,7.9063,4.5417,5.5177,1.1422,1.5493,4.9601,0.0021,4.5557,3.8771,2.4992,0.193,1.4827,2.131,0.0006,2.3773,2.2713,3.426,0.0538,5.7934,2.0207,8.0414,0.685,5.1952,2.3829,0.815,2.8719,1.3169,0.0916,3.2991,1.0159,0.3664,0.6034,4.9917,15.8833,7.6477,4.7252,5.0545,3.3882,1.1515,2.4832,2.4923,1.7437,0.5545,0.8504,0.0007,0.8955,0.7579,0.6084,3.8564,0.0534,2.6672,3.3314,1.638,2.892,2.3194,1.799,2.2362,0.1812,5.3755,3.3894,0.3532,0.6707,1.5758,2.0283,0.0004,0.7404,0.6855,2.0763,3.7183,0.1831,3.5056,1.6201,0.0676,0.7445,6.852,1.443,6.2089,4.6282,4.0569,3.1736,0.1741,5.5651,3.4509,1.5593,5.2403,0.8796,3.4747,3.1054,0.6623,1.7103,0.084,0.1926,0.4967,3.1072,4.2252,1.1055,3.5555,1.383,5.3783,1.1931,3.3553,2.6236,0.6598,3.3781,0.9559,0.6646,2.4846,2.6392,1.0421,1.5302,1.1486,3.143,0.3087,0.8865,0.0007,3.7775,4.6672,2.3501,0.4096,0.4756,0.8055,0.4548,0.249,0.8442,0.001,3.1907,1.9298,3.6699,3.7985,1.8379,0.0898,2.4454,1.0001,6.4948,2.6394,0.4271,4.8908,1.051,0.4847,2.201,3.3689,4.4439,6.9981,1.4772,3.1199,2.0178,1.086,0.0383,1.8334,1.2353,0.0022,1.3166,2.5694,2.2121,5.9467,0.2472,3.3548,2.1636,1.1966,2.7239,2.2086,0.0013,1.3606,2.1832,2.9361,0.4308,0.0094,1.5697,5.2082,2.0241,0.012,1.7731,1.1584,2.1127,0.0182,6.221,0.8635,0.2649,6.0301,4.1271,1.0149,1.5405,5.0,0.7844,3.378,3.2125,1.293,1.1241,0.3464,4.3165,2.2067,2.3149,0.0626,0.0176,0.0653,1.2391,1.6426,0.0015,5.8834,5.9095,0.6728,1.5289,1.0375,0.5595,0.7854,2.8388,6.5597,0.0044,1.1216,0.6583,2.0532,0.0299,0.4363,2.2374,0.0027,2.3261,4.4336,1.583,0.6335,5.6418,12.8555,0.4506,1.3983,0.3056,0.0743,2.4169,0.8492,10.1893,2.2336,0.5853,0.3368,0.5907,4.2783,2.3536,2.7129,2.211,3.3799,1.1356,0.205,3.7534,0.6078,0.0104,0.2024,0.435,2.4763,5.6046,0.5366,2.3116,1.5687,1.3318,3.6873,1.4483,1.248,4.6024,0.5278,4.9416,2.3347,7.3804,8.4379,0.5393,1.5427,0.9817,3.4068,2.76,0.1113,1.4523,0.1327,0.2484,2.9459,0.4173,3.5458,1.8746,4.5711,0.4577,0.0549,4.7447,0.0885,1.0555,1.2321,0.468,3.3225,0.1033,0.1873,2.5632,0.2977,3.5155,2.9785,0.3414,0.3181,0.613,0.1317,0.6899,2.0758,0.184,0.077,0.2909,0.2963,0.2318,5.5881,3.7597,3.8513,3.1837,3.8915,0.9534,4.9596,1.2618,3.584,5.4482,1.1868,0.4449,2.402,5.3681,5.4393,2.5496,5.9428,3.687,7.0219,5.4793,2.3457,2.3184,3.7267,3.6205,2.3415,7.8059,3.018,3.4871,1.1854,6.0015,4.1173,0.8193,4.3918,2.3581,1.8039,3.2384,1.5402,3.4398,3.2961,3.4469,0.9665,3.2468,1.847,0.0068,5.9048,4.5728,2.4904,0.7105,0.2649,4.2471,0.1229,3.6539,3.494,1.8325,0.4949,5.0804,0.2288,0.0773,3.5823,6.5858,1.1084,0.4692,1.4752,0.2655,6.7098,4.1573,4.4714,3.0036,1.9883,0.0108,0.8008,0.7496,2.1175,0.7494,0.37,3.4844,0.3622,0.0394,2.0954,5.8758,3.6469,5.8324,4.9213,2.8511,1.3935,2.7643,2.7625,0.025,3.9509,0.9725,0.4084,4.3441,6.2392,0.7603,8.9767,5.2288,5.9476,8.6284,1.4452,0.7716,1.1847,0.4965,4.8114,6.3828,4.5673,4.6943,0.448,0.7424,3.8239,5.0353,1.0435,2.7089,2.3473,6.432,0.0666,3.1768,0.7118,0.1108,4.8535,4.8577,2.3948,0.9699,3.7072,5.8709,2.9935,0.1825,4.7823,5.0492,1.3038,5.221,0.9813,0.4615,3.2383,0.0008,0.5778,1.9197,4.2644,1.887,4.2493,1.1786,0.7139,0.0153,0.6497,0.6251,0.236,3.368,4.5921,3.5184,0.9526,2.8727,3.8965,0.8635,0.5699,0.1419,1.63,0.3251,0.4519,3.2448,5.8784,0.6748,1.9262,0.5749,1.8905,1.856,0.3552,0.3126,0.0523,2.3858,1.5262,1.3089,1.9936,1.9411,1.7777,0.6541,0.0877,2.2487,7.7326,3.2974,0.7196,0.0135,0.4283,0.5,0.1581,1.6978,0.2908,4.3052,1.7411,2.7954,2.1464,0.5513,3.6402,0.0127,3.7026,4.6438,4.2531,5.4708,1.5609,1.7974,1.91,1.8222,3.6916,4.76,1.5634,5.5158,1.9649,1.65,1.0326,6.7446,3.6879,2.8884,0.0059,1.8915,3.3901,5.25,4.0144,0.0436,2.3671,2.9668,5.3657,2.8466,0.5427,4.0937,2.3129,1.2814,0.2665,3.4842,6.2809,0.4975,0.2399,4.7493,3.8937,3.6723,2.7629,3.0618,2.7911,0.8003,2.8592,3.1255,1.4618,7.4396,3

{"id":3095,"ended":true,"length":660,"text":"In October 2013, Marvel and Disney announced that they would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a May 12, 2021 release date. The first four episodes of the series will air on the streaming service on Disney+.\n\nIn December 2012, Warner Brothers issued a press release, stating that the first episode of Netflix Originals \u2013 Daredevil & Jessica Jones \u2013 will be released on April 12th, 2021. According to the release, Netflix Originals will be available on March 11th, 2021.\n\nMarvel announced on Twitter that Marvel and Disney have reached an agreement \u201cto release two seasons of Daredevil & Jessica Jones\u201d from Disney+, with the latter set to release in March and the first in August 2021. The studio added that it hopes to release all three parts on Netflix by March 31st, 2021.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted that they have agreed to release two seasons of Daredevil & Jessica Jones and that we will do so in both a spring and summer release,\u201d said Kevin Feige, the CEO of Marvel Studios. \u201cThese two seasons of Daredevil & Jessica Jones will premiere in theaters in theaters on May 12, 2021 and on Netflix the following month. We are thrilled to see so many different creators working together, and excited to share our groundbreaking series with Netflix.\u201d\n\nDuring a press conference last month, Marvel president Nick Eisner called the two shows as being a step in righting the \u201csad\u201d relationship between studios, saying: \u201cWe would prefer that those two volumes become on-air and on-line, but we don\u2019t give in to this sort of thing. The reason the two shows didn\u2019t become on-air was because they wanted to keep that relationship in place, so if it became to-go, it would have been better to cancel them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to give these Marvel and Disney partners the chance to return to a relationship that\u2019s been very difficult in that regard,\u201d adds Feige.\n\n\u201cThis series has had many challenges, as it was announced in October 2013. We are hopeful to bring back the series to audiences in the months and years ahead, and it would be great to see Netflix get its momentum going. But it would also be great to have Jessica Jones and Luke Cage back, because those shows were not on-air at the mid-2000s after all. They may not have gotten in a good shape since then, but they are strong characters that can be enjoyed. With Jessica Jones returning to life here, there\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t continue with the series that we produced before Jessica Jones aired.\u201d\n\nIn his tweet, Netflix Founder and CEO Reed Hastings noted that the company has reached an agreement with Disney+ about the release and distribution of Daredevil.

{"id":4136,"ended":true,"length":669,"text":"The Tales series is classified as a role @ - @ playing video game series. Multiple gameplay elements carry over from entry to entry. The main unifying element is the combat system, which takes place on the small screen.\n\nIn addition to the usual gameplay elements, the Tales series offers a deeper, more technical perspective of the role of villain-like, villain-driven characters through the story. A lot of the more traditional action-adventure elements come into play when the characters interact with the stories, and they also add variety to the action.\n\nThis is one of the most anticipated and popular video games of all time. Tales has won titles like Legend of Phantasia, Assassin\u2019s Creed III, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last of Us and many more.\n\nOne of the most exciting video game titles of all time has become a sensation with tons of hype. Most often referred to by its title as \"The X-Men Series\" and many fan-made sequels and sequels, Tales has been a success for gamers. The game is more than just a fun game but an incredible challenge that should be a serious consideration for gamers looking to take their first stab at the game themselves and to succeed in the long-term.\n\nAs a result, here are the top ten video game titles that gamers will enjoy:\n\nTales Legends - A game that has an amazing atmosphere. If it didn't have the story told to you by one of the main villain characters, Tales might not have stood the test of time. To make matters even better, Tales Legends is able to keep to the spirit of the story that inspired the game, which is the most important part of the game. The game is a highly action-adventure game and the game itself is a must-have game for gamers everywhere who enjoy a good action-adventure game to their degree.\n\nTales Heroes - A game that can be played with no shortage of different skills and abilities. Players of Tales Heroes can perform the following skills in order:\n\nTurn Attack - Use the action weapons you saw to attack enemy units.\n\nDrowning - Use your special abilities.\n\nKrogan - Use your special abilities during battle.\n\nFinger Punch - Use your special attacks.\n\nSwinging - Use your skills during attack.\n\nSpinning (aka: turning back to the direction they were at) - Use your special attacks while in a fighting position.\n\nFarting - Use your special attacks while in a throwing position in a fight.\n\nSpinning and Swinging - Use your special attacks while in a throwing position.\n\nSkarmy - Use your special attacks while in a fighting position.\n\nIce Storm - Use your special attacks while in a fighting position.\n\nDragon Age III - A game that's a lot like the Tales games in terms of visuals, the game is different due to an RPG setting. While the gameplay and story are somewhat different than the Tales games, both are well done and not only do they provide a well rounded experience, the game manages to provide a much more polished combat system, as the story is more than just another story.\n\nAs stated previously, Tales Legends may or may not run on PC or Mac. However, the game may also run on PlayStation, Xbox, PlayStation 4, or both.

{"id":1882,"ended":true,"length":683,"text":"The full extent of casualties on that first day are not known. Birdwood, who did not come ashore until late in the day, estimated between three and four hundred dead on the night of June 19. She was one of four shipwrecks to be wrecked by the US Navy off Louisiana, causing injuries ranging from two to 12,000-inch (30-foot) and killing at least four people including three children.\n\nOne survivor said the US Navy lost the \"most valuable ship in America\" in the attacks, the Stinger. \"The crew of this little wreck are still in shock, and one of the first ones who were on the deck is missing,\" said the man said by text message.\n\nThe USS Beecham has not been seen in the US on the day of the attacks. The incident is part of a week-long military training exercise in the Caribbean, a period during which the USS Beecham, which is in service in the Caribbean, and several other ships are training in New York, which has the US military active in the region.\n\nThe attack killed 33 sailors with 16 sailors missing and 21 wounded or seriously injured. The Stinger killed two sailors but sustained no injuries and was uninjured, according to CNN.\n\nOn June 20, the Pentagon sent a naval helicopter to the scene in which more than 300 sailors were killed. In total six crew members were killed, although the Navy said all those wounded were accounted for and that one other person died of injuries suffered when the helicopter crashed.\n\nThe USS Beecham was ordered to the harbor by the President to evacuate sailors who were being evacuated into a port. At the time the ship was ordered to land at Fort Haggis, Maryland and the Navy made a request for more than 100 aircraft, some of which had been damaged while on mission.\n\nThe Stinger sank after it was sunk by a US military naval destroyer. A Navy official called the ship a \"tactical bomb\" for the purpose of stopping the U.S.-backed insurgency.\n\nThe Stinger sank in the Caribbean after its engine was damaged and was no longer operational.\n\nA Navy helicopter was stationed nearby to assist with the rescue. No one was injured.\n\nOn June 2, the destroyer was destroyed and sank in the Gulf of Mexico off San Juan, Puerto Rico. The ship was one of two ships at the start of a training exercise in the region when the attack happened.\n\nThe ship was damaged and sunk after a Navy drone flew in a \"drying cloud of debris and debris\" that had been lying on top of it for months. According to witnesses, the debris and debris became airborne and crashed into the water.\n\nOn June 7, an Israeli ship was targeted by a drone. \"The drone carried out a series of attacks on the ship, which was hit by several hits from a strike group,\" according to local newspaper The Palestinian Daily News.\n\nOn June 8, the U.S. Defense Department sent an additional helicopter, called MQ-9E. At the time the Navy was still investigating the last attack on a ship in service, and the ship is still owned by the American Government and owned by the Israel Defense Forces. \"We will wait for the final information and give you all the facts as soon as possible,\" Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col.

{"id":615,"ended":false,"length":642,"text":"The Food Album has received mixed reviews from most critics ; many felt that while the album was amusing it was not an essential release. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of four stars on his reviews page. On another website he wrote that Food Album \"is, as it turns out, a good record\", however, his review for The Food Album was criticized as well \"for being a lot of fun for those of us who didn't get into it for the sake of being boring. It may seem that there is a greater risk with food Album that it could be considered a good and entertaining album.\"\n\nOn one occasion food Album has received two out of five stars from the critics (one on Food Album's review page, one on Review and one on Taste) as well as one not as good as its predecessor. The other reviewer was critical of a \"good\" release, but a \"worst release\", \"poor quality\" or \"bad album\" among the more critical and critical reviewers. It was also described as \"not a very enjoyable food album\".\n\nSoundtrack\nThe Food Album was produced with the producer Ed Diamandis and engineer Peter Broughton. The album consists of three tracks (three of the four tracks have been recorded simultaneously) that are interlocked between them. The first tracks were heard as part of the early production of an early-2000 album. The first tracks were played out at the same time as their original release date and therefore do not overlap each other. The recording of the album was played for only nine hours per track and was finished during the time the album was recorded at. When mixed, the first track was the sound of the full-length album being played at 7:32\u00a0a.m. in Los Angeles. They were mixed in L.A. in 2001, following a number of minor delays, and released early on January 31, 2004. In September 2004, the record was released through the Records Lab & Music group with Paul Ryan, who had been working on a full-length album along with the other musicians working on his original album. The track version of \"Fruit of Life\" was cut from the first half of the album, with the music removed completely to show the cover. \"Fruit of Life\" was cut in an alternate versions and re-released on March 12, 2005. One of the original recordings with guitar, vocals and instrumentals, \"Fruit of Life\" consisted of four different versions of the full-length album, which were played as separate tracks in a loop for a further four minutes. \"Fruit of Life\" is also included as one of eight covers of \"Fruit of Life\" recorded in 1999.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\n Ed Diamandis \u2013 lead vocals, guitar

{"id":4295,"ended":true,"length":719,"text":"The Gemini spacecraft would have rendezvoused with stacked Centaur and Agena upper stages in low Earth orbit. The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along which they flew together into the sun, where they would have completed a full set of orbital flights, before the spacecraft retired. It would have done a complete set of orbital flights, including one from NASA's Moon Landing mission. But it did not see any opportunity to launch the spacecraft above the space station's surface. And because the Gemini system was in space, the spacecraft could not make a complete transition into its orbit, despite the moon landing. In fact, it was simply unable to get into the orbit.\n\nSo the Gemini astronauts had to try again, this time to reach the moon and get a more realistic look at the lunar surface. After all, the Gemini missions were going to be a series of science experiments with their solar powered spacecraft. And the Gemini mission was more than just science experiments. It was also the beginning of a series of experiments designed to use gravity to help the spacecraft navigate its way through the solar system. It was also a start to a series of experiments aimed at using gravity for space exploration. So all this work became a real test and failure for the human-powered Gemini mission.\n\nThe Gemini mission is estimated to be about 9 million miles (16 million kilometers) long. It would have been more than enough to navigate around the moon at altitudes between 100 and 160 miles (250 kilometers) above the atmosphere of the moon. And unlike the earlier Gemini missions, which could only make very close approach to the lunar surface at about 50 and 60-plus miles (98 and 113 kilometers), the Gemini mission would certainly have been closer to the ground. It didn't have to travel more than 60 kilometers (40 miles) for complete landing on the lunar surface. And it wouldn't have been at a distance as far as the moon could reach.\n\nThe Gemini spacecraft would have made a complete set of orbital flights, including one from NASA's Moon Landing mission. Gemini would have placed the Gemini and Agena spacecraft into the moon, along which they flew together into the sun. So it would have made a complete set of orbit flights between the moon and Earth, where they would have ended up in the solar system.\n\nBut, what does that leave us with? If the Gemini mission is as big as the Apollo missions were at the start, and the moon landing was a disaster, it doesn't seem likely that the Apollo missions would be much bigger, especially since the moon landing would affect every moon landings they made.\n\nIf the Gemini missions were just a few months apart, there's the possibility that they would have carried out various types of experiments that probably happened during their stay on the moon. In fact, most space tourists only notice the moon landings by their eyes during the moon landing missions, but Apollo astronauts were allowed to see through the telescope in the Apollo missions. That would have helped put the Apollo missions on a clearer map of how the lunar exploration programs would work. The Apollo missions were just a series of simple science experiments designed to use the stars (or asteroids) to send a message to the Earth through the telescope, and the Gemini missions were just a series of experiments designed to use gravity to help the spacecraft navigate its way through the solar system.\n\nWith all the science programs that have been discussed and done, and some big discoveries to come, the space tourism markets are well worth it.

{"id":124,"ended":false,"length":613,"text":"The Coldrum Stones have been excavated on multiple occasions. On 16 April 1910, the amateur archaeologist F. J. Bennett began excavation at the site, after previously having uncovered some Neolithic lithics from the rock formations on the shore of the River Coldrum in the area.  The Stones, the oldest of the group, were discovered by two British tourists on the 4th of July 1912, who were walking towards the Stone Walk (which had grown to 12,500 feet). They were located on the shoreside of Coldrum and were later excavated in 1912 and 1913.  On 9 February 1916, Bennett excavated five iron-out of Ironbriston, and found two stone artifacts of the Stone Walk. One had been unearthed from the rock bottom below the Rockford and the other from beneath the Rockford. Bennett then excavated five stones from the ground on the Rockford and discovered an inscription of 'Stone Coldrum Stone' which appeared to be identical to that found in the Stone Walk stones (shown below).  It was also discovered that the Stone Walk stones were part of the 'Neolithic Stone' known as \"Old Rockford Ice Age Stone\", and were therefore placed in series of 'Old Stone' to form a 'Coldrum Stone' type of Stone\n\nOn 9 February 1917 Bennett discovered two \"Old Rockford Ice Age Stone\" as well as five others (shown below). On 10 January 1929 Bennett excavated five Stone Walk stones at another Rockford site. This time a rock Stone was found by a British man who had just returned from a holiday in Greece. Bennett found two IronBriston Stone (shown below) and one Ironbriston Stone (shown above). On 14 December 1918 Bennett excavated three Ironbriston Stone (shown below).\n\nOn 27 February 1938 Bennett excavated two Ironbriston Stone (shown below) at Stonehenge. These stones were found in the Rockford Ice Age Iron Age Stone (shown below).  The Stonehenge Stone was discovered by the British tourist Peter M. Smith, near the Stone Walk site and in his personal collection. A second Ironbriston Stone was found near Stonehenge. In October 1938 Bennett excavated one Ironbriston Stone (shown below).\n\nOn 19 November 1957 Bennett excavated two Ironbriston Stone (shown below) at an Ironbriston site. These rockites were found in the Rockford Ice Age Iron Age Stone (shown above). In January 1991 Bennett excavated another Ironbriston Stone (shown below) in a smaller Rockford Ice Age Stone. Bennett excavated another Ironbriston Stone (shown below) and several Ironbriston Stone (shown below) in January 1992.  (Bennett also found two Ironbriston Stone (shown above), with two more Ironbriston Stone (shown above) found at Stonehenge.) Bennett also excavated two Ironbriston Stone (shown below) and a Stonehenge Stone (shown below).\n\nOn 18 August 2013 Bennett excavated four Stonehenge Stone (shown below) at Stonehenge. These Stonehenge Stone, as used before these stone features, is part of the Coldrum Stone (also shown above which is also called \"Coldrum Stone\").

{"id":548,"ended":false,"length":583,"text":"Discovering the tertiary structure of a protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function. Common experimental methods of structure determination include the extraction of complex structures, or the analysis of protein expression sequences resulting from molecular and physical interactions. These methods are usually performed on cDNAs belonging to a group of cell types, or from an entire library. But there are also widely used methods of analyzing the molecular structure of a complex, including the extraction and analysis of cDNAs belonging to a single group of cells.\nTypically, one of the most valuable and useful methods of analyzing complex components is by analyzing the complex structure of a protein. For example, if a cell contains proteins with the term nucleophil in their genome. In this sequence analysis, the protein is characterized by an X-ray image of nucleotides at a known location. Most often, a protein contains a number of components that are unique to that cell or cell type.\nIt is known in the art to analyze a protein by analyzing the structure of its cDNAs. However, known methods that utilize a nucleic acid sequence can only obtain a certain level of details of the protein and to obtain sufficient detail about the protein\u2019s nucleotide sequence. Accordingly, the techniques used to obtain a specific analysis level for a protein can not be applied to all cell types\u2014whether individual cell types have particular specific nucleotide sequence or not.\nUneventful methods of analyzing a protein are known of \u201chigh-quality\u201d nucleotide probes of the type comprising amino acids with amino acid residues in at least one of the domain (like amino acids in Methylmethylmethacrylate... ).... and of the type comprising protein-containing nucleotide probes (MCTs in amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type separating amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type comprising amino acids of the type wherein one or more bases in the nucleotide sequence are either not required for the analysis of an amino acid or either not required to the analysis of a protein are not necessary to a nucleic acid analysis...... or of the type of amino acid sample that can be compared in a nucleophile analysis.......\nExamples of those procedures are as follows:...... 1,... 2,... 3,.....................................................................\nU.S. Pat.

{"id":402,"ended":true,"length":678,"text":"By early spring of 1794, the situation in France was dire. With famine looming after the failure of the harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was trying to restore the French spirit of unity. Although the British government had been willing to surrender, the French were not willing to surrender while a small number of their citizens had been tortured.\n\nFrance and Britain did not have a common cause for fighting with the French. Britain ruled all territories of the French Revolution and the French were free to return to France in the early 19th century. France and Britain held their own and could not be put under siege until 1790 when the French government declared themselves a sovereign power in Europe by the French Revolution.\n\nToday, France has managed to regain its strength and have become the largest European country by population. France is in need of a government to succeed in solving the problems with the French during the French Revolution. France has also proven that even in the absence of a government and institutions, France has been successful both in overcoming natural and environmental problems.\n\nThe French Government has been very helpful in solving the issues concerning natural and environmental problems, using scientific and educational institutions to promote scientific and scientific knowledge in the fields of science and engineering. French universities and university societies have made a record of the work that the French Government has done as well as the achievements of the French nation.\n\nAt the end of July, the government of France announced that all its institutions would be closed due to the coronavirus outbreak. Since last semester, when the French National Council of the Society of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences recommended on the closure of all the agricultural and scientific institutions in order to prevent the spread of the Covid19, the government has managed to save the French Federation from a serious crisis situation.\n\nToday, the first batch of medicines of the Pharmaceutical Society of France, the Society of Scientific and Analytical Chemistry (SAEAC) were delivered to the French authorities with the help of the Health Ministry. SAEAC was established by Sir Albert H\u00f4lons. During his career, Sir Albert H\u00f4lons has been involved in the provision of medicines. The pharmaceuticals are made by three manufacturers: Agri-Food, Avant, and Biotechniques.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company Agri-Food and Biogeochemical has been working closely with the Health Ministry. After SAEAC, the pharmaceuticals from Agri-Food were sent to the Medicines Department of the Health Ministry and were tested for any possible symptoms, especially for severe cases of Covid19 pneumonia. After the first batch of medicines arrived, the Medicines Department had to wait several months. In the latter part of last month, the Health Ministry received the first shipment of medicines from agri-food and biogeochemical manufacturers.\n\nThe Medicines Department of the Ministry of Health, which runs the pharmaceutical industry, has been the main operator through the last several months. Health Ministry will be responsible for testing and monitoring of all pharmaceutical products, medicines, and food products. SAEAC will also take care of the procurement of medicines, medicines, and vaccines developed by manufacturers, as well as conducting biotechnology and biological research.\n\nAs stated during the beginning of the year, the outbreak of the respiratory disease Covid-19 is also causing serious problems. The infection is spread through the respiratory droplets that are absorbed by the coronavirus.

{"id":4929,"ended":false,"length":707,"text":"Construction of the California Southern was repeatedly interrupted by Santa Fe's rival, Southern Pacific Railroad ( SP ). In one instance, the California Southern was set to build a level junction, between Pueblo, Mexico, and San El\u00edas, Mexico. The first section was complete, but it failed to finish. The second was completed in time, but the Santa Fe's \"A\" section did not complete due to \"internal railroad difficulties resulting primarily from poor service on the Santa Fe's system\", according to Southern Pacific Railroad ( SP ) Superintendent William Smith.\n\nThe Southern Pacific and Southern Pacific Southern Railroad ( SP ) both became the subject of two separate lawsuits over the construction of the railroads' \"B\" section of the San Felipe and San Jacinto sections as early as 1969. The first lawsuit involved the construction of parts of the C-section \"J\" section, which led to the construction of \"South\" section, which was in turn constructed on the existing \"Y\". SP in turn alleged both sections were defective and were in violation of state regulations. In response to the San Felipe and S-sections construction work, SP sued for breach of state law, claiming that SP should have placed \"South\" section, instead of \"A\" section and that SP should have constructed parts that were \"a-\" as opposed to \"a-\" as opposed to \"b-\". SP denied SP's allegations. In another case, SP claimed that the construction of parts of the \"A\" section led to \"bad service\" on the Santa Fe's system.\n\nIt was the second lawsuit against both SP- and SP- construction in the San Felipe and S-sections. In the first case the California Southern and SP-construction work went unanticipated. SP said that it \"did not expect anything of the kind\", referring to the failure to meet all state requirements including the construction of the section \"A\". In the second suit SP asserted that the construction of the \"A\" section was necessary to meet the construction of the \"South\" section. SP claimed that SP employees were not properly trained in the construction skills of working the \"A\" section as they were allowed to do at the company's facilities to avoid problems with the local labor laws. According to the trial court, the railroad company provided inadequate training for construction workers. SP claimed that it hired only part of the workers to be able to perform basic training because SP was not equipped to support a work team of construction workers. The trial court also alleged that those employees in the \"A\" section were unable to provide proper training to the company's construction workers. SP had to give these workers more time to complete the construction of the B-section.\n\nThe trial court found that the entire construction work for \"A\" section \"A\" was unanticipated and the work team was too slow to do the required training. However, the trial court ruled that SP had violated this fact in the construction and construction work and had violated the \"A\" section. As a result, the plaintiff complained about SP's violation of the Civil Law. However, the decision was struck down by a federal appeals court in 1969. In the ruling, Judge William Montgomery said the two-day trial court was wrong \"to order that the defendants not make the construction part of their work work, and to let workers do the construction

{"id":4914,"ended":true,"length":549,"text":"Saccharolipids describe compounds in which fatty acids are linked directly to a sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone, and a fatty acid is then polymerized. The sucrose derivative can be produced by, for example, the manufacture, polymerization, or chemical reaction of a sucrose, a fatty acid, or the like. A complex of polymers can be used, for example, for conjugation with sucrose.\nConventional polymers can be used for this purpose. However, the reaction conditions, if any and the reactions, are complex and not simple enough for high yield. For example, if the viscosity of the material is high, but below the average viscosity of the solvent, polymerization is not sufficiently carried out for the conversion of sucrose and its sugar to sugars.\nSince most conventional sugars are polysaccharides, it is conceivable that sugar compounds or fatty acids are converted by polymerization in the form of sugars. The conversion may include any addition of sugar. The conversion rate of the glucose conversion may be limited in consideration of the conversion rate or the conversion rate of the saccharolipid in general.\nConsequently, there have been proposed polymers that have a low conversion rate, a low conversion rate in terms of cost of production (i.e. high yield), and a high conversion rate in terms of purity, that is, as being of sufficient quality to produce high yield. For example, Korean Patent Publication (US 2001\/0005016 A1).\nIt is known to make a high yield-friendly sugar-soluble polyethylene monomer [U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,082,958, 5,113,917, 5,114,058, 5,148,923, 5,148,913, 5,147,769, 5,149,736, 5,149,736, 5,147,769, 5,148,913, and 5,147,769 are known. In Korean Patent Publication (US 2001\/0005016 A1), for example, a sugar dihydrocarbon monomer, a polyethylene glycol monomer, a polymeric copolymer thereof, a polyacrylic acid monomer, a polyvinyl alcohol monomer, a polyvinyl alcohol monomer, a polyolefin monomer, an acrylate polymethyl ether monomer, a polyurethane monomer, a polycyclooctane monomer, a polystyrene monomer or a cycloacrylate monomer which is unsaturated in the presence of a solvent. The polymers can be used as copolymers of sugars such as glycerol and sucrose.\nIn the case of sugar polymers, it has conventionally been recognized that such sugar polymers do not give satisfactory yield of sugars such as glycerol and sucrose.\nThe problem of the solubility of the saturated saturated saturated saturated saturated saturated fatty acids is that the polymers used cannot meet a high yield of these fatty acids.\nU.S. Pat. No. 3,872,921 describes a sugar polyethylene copolymer. In this copolymer, a polysaccharide is formed by dissolving a total of a plurality of sugars in a solvent before dissolving the same. Therefore, it is possible to perform a synthesis of glycerol and sucrose. Such a synthesis has not been performed in cases where sugars can form low

{"id":3324,"ended":false,"length":595,"text":"Thomas Alcock ( 1709 \u2013 1798 ), Vicar of Runcorn, writer, cider maker Thomas Hazlehurst ( 1816 \u2013 1876 ), Methodist who paid for the construction of 12 chapels and three villages in 1776, was one of the founders of Christian literature and was one of the founders of the Protestant movement, later the Protestant League of England.\n\nLife\nThomas Alcock was an English-born father of a Christian son, James (1709\u20131856). His mother was the widow of Sir Edmund, seconded from 1831 to 1829 by Elizabeth (d. 19 June 1728\u201321 December 1728). He had one daughter, Lady Hazlehurst. William Hazlehurst had three sons: James, James II (born 1828), William and William (19 January 1729 to October 1730).\n\nEarly life\nThomas Alcock was a son of James C. Hazlehurst (1717\u20131806), also a son of Thomas A. Hazlehurst and Elizabeth (d. 1718) Hazlehurst. He was educated at the Church of St. Giles and went to study at the University of London where he entered a Faculty of Education. He was a Christian pupil at the Presbyterian Church and was ordained the second-in-command to the Church of Our Lord. He worked at the New Church in London in the Middle Ages.\n\nHazlehurst left the New Church to study in the Old Town Town Hall in 1738. In 1748 he left to study at the University of Leicestershire for 15 months to study in Ireland. Since then he was employed at St. Barnabas (then County of Leicestershire) from 1758\u20131759 and at the Methodist Church of Leicestershire in 1759-70 before retiring in 1577.\n\nHe made many friends with the first members of the Reformation, including Stephen of the Old Testament Society. This was especially the case against the late Reformation movement of 1601, which is best remembered for the influence of John Calvin on James.\n\nJames Hazlehurst died in 1775. His widow was the widow of Thomas Hazlehurst (born 15 March 1735), a physician who had many relatives in England, and often left for medical treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. She was probably the sole widow of Thomas Hazlehurst.\n\nDeath\nThomas Alcock was the ninth of a family of three daughters. He left a wife and four children and died after he left for a week on 13 March 1770. His widow Mary Hazlehurst died in 1776 on her sixth birthday. Her husband William Hazlehurst died six years later, aged seventy. Thomas Hazlehurst married the British civil servant Elizabeth Hazlehurst (16 February 1738\u20131806) on 17 January 1779. He was the first wife of Anne (d. 1744) the second and first husband of Peter (1727\u20131809), the second and first husband of Emma (n\u00e9e Hazlehurst). William Hazlehurst had a daughter, Mary.

{"id":20,"ended":true,"length":721,"text":"In 2009, Fernandez traveled to India for a modeling assignment. She studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John, and successfully auditioned for Sujoy Ghosh's fantasy film Aladin (1983).\n\n\"I was a bit late, but a few years later, when I was still pretty young, I started working as a fashion consultant for a time\u2026, so I was an instant success. But now, I see more women of my age. There aren't many women on the street; there are women who are in the street.\"\n\nTo overcome these challenges, and to make a positive and positive change in her personal and professional life, she decided to put her career on hold for the rest of her life.\n\nWith that in mind, she embarked on a journey to meet up with all those she met. She learned to live life on her own without a partner, which she did by sharing the experience of being in love with a man. Even in the midst of her experience and transition, she was inspired to do what she was passionate about all along.\n\n\"There's so much we've learned, with this journey. As a woman, there were moments of isolation, like I had to stop everything. But it was the most wonderful experience I ever had and it's where I learned so much, that I owe it all back to myself,\" Fernandez said.\n\nDuring her six-month trip to India, the 29-year-old was inspired to share her love of cinema with her followers who are part of this journey. During the nine months she remained in Mumbai, working towards her goal of creating a cinema that is both socially-conscious and culturally relevant.\n\n\"I think in India, it's the way of life and the way we live. Even in the worst of times, you have a sense of peace and calm. We live on the outskirts of Mumbai. If I came here, I would not have even known what my life is. I would of had to go see the best scenes in the cinema. I would have just been stuck here. I saw so much.\"\n\nWhile Fernandez enjoys making film and cinema in the same terms which she once described as a 'cult film', she is aware of what she feels is'special' about the work she is doing.\n\nShe attributes much of the inspiration to her personal life. This came when she decided to change her lifestyle and start acting in a fashion industry.\n\n\"Every movie I have done has been an adaptation of a specific piece of work. For instance, I have starred in the French language films. I have also worked with a male singer or actor and I love making music. But when you take music in the field, you have to take the creative risks... You have to take a risk, but it's more difficult than you thought. It's a gamble, but there's nothing better than getting a chance to open up and experience an extraordinary life.\"\n\nFernandez's journey from being a film lover to an actress has been an experience that can only be described as difficult.\n\n\"To say that, from the outside you cannot seem to be yourself. I think what is strange is that the people who are famous in India say that you are not \"your own\", that you are independent and therefore you are just someone.

{"id":3875,"ended":false,"length":726,"text":"The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 96 % approval rating with an average rating of 8 @. @ 4 \/ 10 based on 241 reviews. The site's consensus reads :'( [\u2026] is one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. The story, cast, and characters, while they're perfectly honest, are just plain out of whack.'s \"fancy flick' (which had an impressive 12,500 reviews out of 24) is easily the worst ever made, and it suffers nothing but the very worst plot. It's the kind of shit that makes people watch movies and play videos and not try new movies, only to experience disappointment only to then realize if you had never watched it the plot was awful and nothing about it was interesting. And as much as I loved this movie, its plot is very much out of whack \u2014 at least considering that most people won't admit to it. It has more than a decent plot, but the plot is weak because it's in fact pretty damn shitty.'s \"troubly flick\" (which had an impressive 12,000 reviews out of 24\") is easily the worst ever made, and it suffers nothing but the very worst plot. (and if the plot were as good as this movie, I totally doubt I'll ever be a movie-goers' critic.)\nIn addition to this, it's not even the first time that critics' reviews have come out that were more positive than this one... except when they were about the movies themselves... this one was also only negative when they said that this movie had to be watched at home, and that the review was \"fantastic\".\nAnd since the critics haven't been that clear about the movies themselves, and the critics seem to be willing to accept their criticisms (though that's a matter of opinion), it's a good thing that critics are all-in when it comes to getting praise for movies like this, and that's particularly good if you'd like to see the reviews go out the night before a movie is released.\nFor more information on any reviews going out this year, get The Reaching of J. Edgar Hoover (by Jeffrey Sachs & Andrew Shiller at CNN).\nThe Reaching of J. Edgar Hoover\nThe Reaching of J. Edgar Hoover, \u201cMy First Ever Movie,\u201d directed by Christopher Nolan. Rated R (for language at runtime), this is a decent movie by a movie giant, which didn't necessarily mean that it should be any less enjoyable, especially since in a previous review, Adam Sandler and Christopher Nolan mentioned that the movie is likely not as bad or even as good as the original. But, they also stated that the movie was probably the first movie Nolan made since Dark Knight Returns in 2010, and it was \"as good as the original trilogy\" by a lot.\nNolan said in his second appearance about the movie that \"the experience of watching this movie in person is so much more appealing than anything you might have ever anticipated,\" and it's not just about seeing the scenes in motion. At the end of the day, the story of this movie, as Nolan previously stated, is more than just about the movie, and the audience will see that when Nolan gives \"your first ever movie\" a positive review, he's being fair. No matter how strong or not the movie is, Nolan will undoubtedly be critical of the movie's plot and action, as well as Nolan himself... until then.\nThis reviewer is the guy who started talking about \"the worst movie we've ever made\" back in 2012.\nThis review of Nolan's \"First ever movie\" by Christopher Nolan.\n[H\/T: The Daily

{"id":4937,"ended":true,"length":677,"text":"Maulbetsch did not play for the varsity team until the fall of 1914 when he was 24 years old. Before the season began, Maulbetsch was `` touted as one of the fastest halfbacks in the United States\" by coach Arthur \"Hockey Mc\" Larkin who \"thought, well, maybe we could have good speed\" of 6'4\". He achieved the feat in 1912 as well.\n\nOn Aug 1, 1914, Maulbetsch lost his balance and lost the balance of his ankle. It was only later that he was placed in a chair for a period and kept up a good pace.\n\nHis later training with the varsity side was as bad as he could have had due to the effects of arthritis that hampered his form.\n\nMaulbetsch played on the home side as a young boy but after he graduated from the varsity club in 1936, he was taken to the varsity team. He played more than 90 games in his first year at the club and won three trophies that year. In that season he claimed all 3 titles in the varsity team. His father was a fan of the varsity football team, so Maulbetsch was named as the club player in his father's team. His father, as a fan of varsity football, was the chairman. His coach was Henry \"Bobby\" Barger.\n\nMaulbetsch came to the United States in 1938 at the age of 21 and played on and off as a teenager. Later in life he married and had two daughters, and after the death of his father, he returned to the United States. Maulbetsch was then a student at the United States Naval Academy from 1937 to 1944 and was involved in the scouting department and the American Legion.\n\nIn 1938, he had been involved in a robbery, while on a vacation to Japan, that left a bullet hole in his back. He also lost his wallet and his cell phone when he was robbed by someone who left a cash package in his car. He was a member of the United States Naval Academy Class 5, and earned a scholarship to University Hill College in Chicago.\n\nMaulbetsch was awarded the Distinguished Commendation of his class in 1958 by the United States Navy for his work in the United States Naval Academy and his heroism in the fight against an enemy submarine. This came after he finished his two years at the Naval Academy and earned a silver medal and a bronze medal at the Navy Academy Games in 1958 after he scored 39 points, while receiving the Navy Award for best young athlete.\n\nMaulbetsch graduated from the Naval Academy in 1959 and was awarded the Distinguished Achievement award by Captain William B. Cade (Captain ) in 1978. The award was issued in memory of his father. \"The American Legion\" was also the name given to the United States Marine Corps Military Scholarship program.\n\nMaulbetsch's family moved to Indianapolis in 1961 and he began working at the Naval School of International Arts in Indianapolis, where he eventually graduated. He also earned a degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Indiana in 1958 where he earned a BS in aerospace engineering.

{"id":3537,"ended":false,"length":669,"text":"To design and build his ship Nansen chose Colin Archer, Norway's leading shipbuilder and naval architect. Archer was well known for a particular hull design that combined seaworthiness with a shallow draught engine that could accommodate the needs of long range battleship operations. He was also known for his ability to use his considerable knowledge of naval architecture to help craft of his choice. As the world's first shipbuilder Archer was inspired by the renowned architecture of architect J\u00f8rn \u00d8yberg's architect. Archer achieved a reputation for innovation in both hull design and engineering and was awarded a number of awards for his skill on and off the ship.\n\nBorn in Tromsovere, Archer graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) from the School of Architecture and Landscape and was a finalist for the Architecture International competition. He then applied his research in his design and construction at a variety of sites around Norway. He received a degree in Architecture from the University of Oslo and a Doctor of Architecture from the University of Copenhagen in 1994. He spent a period at the University of Oslo studying in the Architecture Centre for Architecture and Landscape. He then took a short work leave, finishing his first series of projects, namely and this one, the  long long line, with its  long curved surface and  horizontal wing. At this point, he was taken in as well as the others.\n\nEarly career\nArcher spent the first part of his career at J\u00f8rn \u00d8yberg and built his long line of small vessels and ships. His designs included five long line of  long ships and four round berths for the Norwegian Sea Fleet and the Norwegian Line, between the Baltic Sea and the Dutch Channel near Utvely. He was also the forerunner of the shipbuilding industry.\n\nArcher won several awards for his projects in this area of design, such as the Norwegian Sea Fleet  and  long ships and  wide berths for the Norwegian Line, and the Norwegian Line, between the Baltic Sea Islands and the Netherlands Channel.\n\nHe was awarded the first Norwegian Order of the Blue Star, in recognition of his excellence in building high quality vessels of all types.\n\nArcher also served as a delegate at the Norwegian Order of the Diamond, and received the award from the Norwegian Sea Fleet Committee in 2008 and the Norwegian Line, in 2009. His final project was the long line of  long ships, which at this level, was a unique and special achievement.\n\nArcher developed his designs and shipbuilding skills by using very extensive research and experience while still building his craft, so that they met all the needs of the world's longest running ships. These work, including the  long long lines and  long berths, were the first examples of architectural ingenuity and research. In contrast he was able to develop two more high quality design and design projects, namely the  long long line of ships, which reached the final destination through the line's length.\n\nAward and recognition\n\nThe Norwegian Order of the Blue Star has honoured him with the Order of the Sea, the Norwegian Order of the Gold Star, and the order of the Bronze Star, as well as a prestigious award for excellence in the design and construction of the ship-building industry.\n\nAs well as the prestigious award, the Order of the Star also honors Archer, who is also the first Norwegian to have been

It is the largest Greek community in the US.\n\nIt covers 3,000 members, including 3,000 from Michigan State University.\n\nIn 2010, the GCA was renamed the Greek Community and was renamed the Michigan State University Greek Community to celebrate its founding in 1872.\n\nThe Greek Community Association was formed in 1872 by a group of students, faculty, and volunteers, who worked in order to expand Greek experience and knowledge within the Greek community community. It served its mission, creating more than 100 Greek organizations throughout the year.\n\n\"What started in 1872 is the largest Greek community in the United States, and I think that\u2019s pretty amazing considering the size of it,\" said GCA Chair Ann Marie Lillivre,\n\n\"We\u2019re more focused today than we ever have been before. If it didn\u2019t look like Greek, it probably would have looked like Greece... Our students are more open and tolerant of other cultures, but also they\u2019ve found out that it\u2019s important to make your own way in the community,\" added Lillivre.\n\nAt the centre are the Greek Food Bites, Greek Market, Greek Village, Greek Cafe, Greek Diner, Greek Diner & Greek Bar & Kitchen, Athens Athens Pub, Greek Grill, Greek Pizza, as well as others.\n\nIn order to attract more Greek guests, the GCA is also celebrating International Agreeing Day today, which is designated to mark the start of the week when everyone in the United States is fully prepared for Agreeing Day. So it is now time for us to take a little break during International Agreeing Day.\n\nAs part of our Great Greek Project, we\u2019ll offer an array of activities that we believe will make it easier for everyone to learn Greek. Some of the activities include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Free Greek Market and Greek Cafe\n\n\u2022 Greek Diner\n\n\u2022 Greek Tavern\n\n\u2022 Greek Bar & Kitchen\n\n\u2022 Greek Diner & Greek Bar & Kitchen\n\n\u2022 Greece Pizza\n\n\u2022 Greek Pasta Bites\n\n\u2022 Greek Restaurant \/ Restaurant\n\n\u2022 Greek Cafe\n\n\u2022 Greek Diner\n\n\u2022 Greek Tavern\n\n\u2022 Greek Grill\n\n\u2022 Greek Bar & Kitchen\n\n\u2022 Greek Diner and Greek Tavern\n\n\u2022 Greek Grill\n\n\u2022 Greek Cafe\n\n\u2022 Greek Pub\n\n\u2022 Greek Pizza\n\n\u2022 Greek Pizza\n\n\u2022 Greek Pizza\n\nThere are even some great Greek festivals available during the day (or as late as midnight), including the Greek Festival of the Dead, and the Greek-American Festival of Lent.\n\nTo mark International Agreeing Day today:\n\nFor Greek, you should know we\u2019re proud to be part of the Michigan State University Greek Movement. We are an organization created to support community engagement in Greek life.

{"id":4561,"ended":false,"length":700,"text":"The 47 prefectures of Japan each have a flag resembling the national flag insofar as consisting of a symbol, called a mon, charged on a monocolored field ( with the exception of Ehime, the center on the horizon). On the other hand, the three major Japan provinces, including Osaka, Takao, and Keirin, have a monocolored flag, the one in which it is painted ( ) (i.e., \"white\", the other in which it is painted ).\n\nIn addition, one of the countries, Japan, consists of a monocolored flag, the one on the horizon. In terms of its design, it stands out as a symbol of the spirit of the nation (i.e., national identity ). The Japan flag has a monocolored motif as its signature. This signifies the presence of the nation in the country and its history \u2014 that is, of the spirit of the nation.\n\nOf the more than 780 Japanese provinces in the United States and Canada, in which the national flag is displayed, approximately 50 have more than one. The United States flag is often depicted as a monocolored flag because of its monocolored significance. The symbolization and the historical significance of the Monocolored flag are also recognized throughout the rest of the country where it is observed. The Japanese flag is recognized as part of Japan's national identity.\n\nDuring the 17th century, Japan was the center of a major revolution in its political evolution and its cultural development. According to the late Saitama Sekigami, the first Japanese minister of finance, \"The Japanese flag has become one of the largest symbols of national identity and the national symbol\". He saw the flag as a symbol of national unity as the country \"grows up into a national consciousness\".\n\nThe Japanese flag is currently being celebrated worldwide as a symbol of Japan's economic and social development, as well as the modernization of its country's social and cultural system.\n\nThe Japanese flag of 1601, for example, was first placed on the table near the Great Wall of England in 1715, and is still an important symbol of the country. Today, the Japanese flag is now displayed on three of its bases at the entrance of Buckingham Palace, where the United Kingdom government has erected a sculpture in honour of the 1601 flag. The flag was originally designed as a symbol of Japan's industrial development and growth, but at the start, Japanese officials were aware that a symbolic symbol made of glass and metal made of polystyrene would be difficult to sell. For a century, Japanese manufacturers made the flag, which became known as the \"japanese one\" (the Japanese flag ). In the 1910s, however, that idea has been revived ( ) with the addition of an electric flag.\n\nThe current Japanese flag is marked with the \"T\" color (green) to signify the state of Japanese culture. The flag has also featured the national motto \"One day\", which is written in Japanese and is the national motto of the country. As an additional feature, there are numerous signs of Japanese culture in the flag. However, the flag is also widely known, as the \"T\" color is used as the national motto, and the symbol represents the state of Japan as \"one day\".\n\nToday, the Japanese flag is being used as a

{"id":4595,"ended":false,"length":713,"text":"On 16 July, Persano took the Italian fleet, with twelve ironclads, out of Ancona, bound for the island of Lissa, where they arrived on the 18th. With them, the fleet left on the 30th, arriving at the island of Lissa on 18 July, the next morning. It was on board a small ship, the S-S, that they arrived on Lissa. On 27 July, the fleet departed for Rome. The S-S remained there until the 21st, reaching Rome via the canal between the two cities and sailing into Italy. The fleet remained there for another five days, and was later joined by the T-V, two ships from the mainland of the United States, on board.\n\nAfter the fleet departed on 28 August, the fleet sailed on to Europe to join Spanish Imperialist Captain Juan Carlos de Guindos at Gibraltar. As the Admiral was departing a few days after the fleet departed, he was joined by Spain's King Juan Carlos II and his personal entourage, who were carrying documents which would include all paperwork about the ships that had sailed there and the names of the Admiral and his wife.\n\nOn 8 August, the fleet left Gibraltar and joined Spanish Imperialists. At the same time, he was meeting with Spanish President Joaquin Castro and the Portuguese president, Rafael Correa in Rome. However, as his presence in their country was limited due to the lack of food, the Admiral tried to persuade Castro to give him a food ration of  for a few weeks. As a gesture, Castro also granted the Admiral access to the Queen's Grand Hall for the rest of the week. When the Admiral had a meeting with the Portuguese government in Madrid on 20 September, the Spanish government gave the Admiral a request to take the food ration off of the Admiral, only for a few weeks.\n\nOn 14 January, the ship left Gibraltar from Portugal. After the blockade had passed, the Admiral returned to Spain, but the Spanish government was unable to force Castro to buy the ration, so the Admiral boarded a small vessel, her captain and the Princess of Montevideo, with an Italian commander aboard. On 26 July, the Admiral sailed on to Europe on board the Spanish Guianas, bound for the Spanish Isles through the Strait of Gibraltar. The Spanish fleet was in command from July 1 to 21, the ship was fitted with three patrol boats, 1 crew with an escort escort at the start, and a captain. After a period of quiet diplomacy, the Admiral made peace with the Portuguese government, and had a very small number of Portuguese prisoners taken from the French prisons. On 11 October, the Admiral decided to surrender his passport and return to Spain which followed the decision to negotiate with Spain's authorities about the future of the Spanish army. On 20 November, the Admiral departed.\n\nLater life\nBy the summer of 2013, the Admiral resumed his maritime service in Spain as one of the founding members of the International Labour Organisation. He served as a delegate of the International Maritime Organization (\"IMO\") for the International Council for Maritime Union in Chile. He remained a member of the International Federation for Maritime Exposition (IMA); a member of the IMA's International Maritime Conference Board (IEMACB); a member of the International Maritime Association Board (\"IMA-IB\"); and a member of IMA's International Council for Maritime Relations, the world's largest maritime trade association and a member of IMA's international maritime commerce organization.

{"id":4359,"ended":false,"length":693,"text":"The Court agreed with Malaysia that the Johor Sultanate had original title to Pedra Branca, rejecting Singapore's argument that the island was terra nullius. It found it was not disputed that Johor had the rights to the land. The Supreme Court, however, stated that Johor's title to Pedra Branca, while being a subject of an original title, was, in fact, an extension of the land it did own.\nThe apex court, in its judgement, also ruled on the issue of land ownership, and sought an explanation for the title provided to the land. The Supreme Court held that the title granted by Singapore was an extension of the land it owned, as it claimed only a small area of land had been acquired from the Johor Seriki Land Office and was retained in connection with its original title to the land. The apex court found that there was no legitimate basis for Singapore to claim ownership of a portion of the land acquired from the Johor Seriki Land Office for the land held by Singapore.\nThe court also ruled that the title granted by Singapore to Pedra Branca also claimed ownership over the land held by the Johor Seriki Land Office or had been retained in connection with its original title to the land held by Singapore. The court also held that Singapore had the power to demand that the land acquired from Singapore be retained in connection with its original title.\nSingapore's appeal of the Johor title to Pedra Branca, based on a review of the court's decision, is likely to open up a myriad of avenues for Singapore, which is also facing a severe banking crisis which could affect the financial system. It could also be ruled that a separate court was required to investigate the case and would not be allowed to issue the Johor title to Singapore in order to prevent this from occurring.\nIt may also pave the way for Singapore to file an appeal to the Supreme Court regarding its own land issues. In September last year, the Malaysian High Court said that the Johor title to Telang Prisah was valid until Dec 31, 2014. Telang Prisah, in turn, stated that Telang Prisah would be granted in the same manner which was granted by Singapore. It also said it would ensure that Telang Prisah was preserved in any case. The trial court in question, however, also ordered the prosecution to establish that Telang Prisah was not an island entity at all.\nSingapore will also have a chance to appeal to the Supreme Court regarding its own issue of land. Singapore, on the other hand, will have further opportunities to use the Johor title to keep its assets in Singapore for its economic and political interests. In the latter, the Malaysian government may appeal to the Supreme Court for a stay of proceedings against Singapore's ownership of the land it owned. Singapore's response to this challenge would also allow Singapore to file an appeal with the Supreme Court.\nEarlier this year, the High Court in Telang Prisah ruled that Telang Prisah was subject to a separate judgment, which allowed Singapore to decide whether it had a right to retain the land it purchased from the Johor Seriki Land Office or have a claim against Singapore. Telang Prisah was the land-holders which received the Johor title to their land. Telang Prisah acquired it after Singapore, Singapore alone, acquired Telang Prisah in 2006. The Johor title to the land to which Singapore has sold it was subject to Singapore's consent. However, after the judgment, the High Court stated that the Singapore Government had not made a claim against Singapore.\nSingapore has already appealed to Singapore's high court about its own land matter.\n(Edited by Sumit

{"id":1658,"ended":false,"length":713,"text":"In November 1948, 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines was again reestablished. The final stages of fighting between the Nationalists and the Communists, in the Chinese Civil War ( also known as the Chinese Civil War ) in 1948 between the US and the British, resulted into the \"War of the Second Intensifies\". One of the two main causes of the conflict was the communist forces in southern China \"war\" of the American-British war of Independence. The American occupation of southern China resulted in American and British military and civilian deaths, and the Japanese invasion and occupation of southern China ( and also the internment and enslavement of Japanese civilians ) in 1949 resulting in the 'Japanese Civil War', which broke the Soviet Union, which was declared national independence by the Soviet Union on 1 August 1949.\n\nOn 2 October 1947, the United States of America invaded the Korean Peninsula with a military strike launched against North Korea. On October 4, the New York Times revealed that the United States carried out the first major U.S. military operation since the civil war. The action took place on the Korean peninsula, near the North Korean border, with the Russian army occupying South Korean territory, and then killing more than 100,000 Korean civilians in the process.\n\nOn 16 July 1949, the Japanese army took control of South Korean territory, allowing Japanese forces to overrun many of the Korean military forces. On 2 August 1949, President Moon Moon signed a treaty giving the United States a permanent U.S. and Japanese government in South Korea.\n\nOn 19 July 1949, South Korean leader Kim Il Sung announced that South Korea would withdraw from the war and join the United States ( and Japanese) in the next United Republic. The joint statement in early 1950 called for the South Korean government to immediately take steps to establish a permanent government in South Korea, and said that this was a \"good thing to do\". On 5 November 1951, Kim signed the U.S. Peace Resolution, calling for peace between the two countries and of course the Korean Peninsula to be reopened to the U.S. On 3 December 1951, the United States and Japan signed a peace treaty, which ended North Korea's Korean War. On 1 October 1954, Lee Gee, South Korea's president, signed what would be his largest peace treaty with the Allied Powers (the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom) prior to World War II.\n\nOn 15 February 1956 at the start of a week of negotiations by the U.S. government and the Japanese government, after both nations broke away from Seoul, in a \"two-sided negotiations\", the United States agreed to accept the treaty. With the United States continuing to work with South Korea on peace, the Japanese government in January 1958 signed the Treaty of Seoul, making the return of the Korean Peninsula under the South Korean \"war\" under the United Nations. On 1 February 1959, the Japanese government in Kanto declared a state of emergency against the residents of the South Korean territory which would last over 5 years, forcing the Korean government to form an informal government with no majority there. On 4 February 1960, the Japanese government officially declared that the Korean Peninsula was now under a state of emergency and ordered the evacuation of all non-South Korean civilians and soldiers from the South Korean territories as \"civil war\".\n\nThe Korean Peninsula is part of Japan's former, uninhabited, war-torn territory (from 1950-1950).

{"id":1027,"ended":false,"length":695,"text":"The same three brigades \u2013 one mounted rifle, one light horse and one Yeomanry, with the 10th Light Horse Regiment ( 3rd Light Horse Brigade ) supporting the Yeomanry \u2013 moved to attack the North Wabash Dam between 2 April 2013 and 1 May 2014.  The first attack was a large-caliber, long-range round that was fired on a convoy of the 4th Indian Army of North Dakota at 6pm on 5 May 2014. The incident was recorded by Lt Col James F. Jones III, who then described the incident as \"a brilliant display of our artillery capabilities and the bravery of our officers, along with the professionalism and skill of our troops\", as well as the bravery of the firefighters. One man was also wounded during that attack.\nThe Yeomanry was one of 11 teams to fire two rounds of ordnance on the bridge at the west end of the Dam, which was badly damaged.  The soldiers were attacked from a distance, but managed to escape.  They managed to locate and capture the terrorists, both men were identified and were released from their positions.  No casualties were reported during that day, with the attacks all being made clear on 8 June 2014.\n\nHistory and incident history\nIn 1868, a group of British-owned firms purchased the Dam.  It is estimated that the dam was created in 1869, but was not operational within 2\u00bd years of its creation.  The dam, at the south edge of north Africa, was a major artery through the continent of Africa and it was used by the First World War.  With the end of World War I, the dam was completely closed off from the rest of the continent.\n\nThe Dam was opened to the public on 1 April 1913, allowing residents and visitors to continue to enjoy the dam on their walks, as well as being the only public riverfront entrance to the Dam.   When it was closed to outsiders, the dam would be closed off, but the dam was gradually opened back up through time for the public to use it to access the dam again.\n\nBy the end of World War I, the dam was once again full.  The dam had become one of Europe's most important reservoirs, with nearly 50,000 cubic metres of natural water flowing daily.  The dam was also used by the Red Army to store fresh water for its war offensive.  This came at a cost of \u00a33 billion and the dam was a major loss for the Union Army, which was unable to keep up its military spending due to the war.\n\nThe dam's flood defences were destroyed and the rest of the dam was destroyed. With the restoration of the dam completely completed, the water level which had risen in May 2014 had dropped from the dam onto the river bank.  The dam rose from the water back into the riverbank by 3.6 metres, allowing the river to pass through a narrow channel.  The dam also saved the local economy.  It was the largest and oldest continuously operating dam in Europe.\n\nIn 1877, the Dam was rebuilt. The new dam was the first dam built by a major British firm outside of Europe (or Europe).  It was built with the approval of the Government, and the two-day dam break was opened by the King James VIII in 1911. The dam was also rebuilt after its temporary collapse in 1919, and was repaired by the government in 1934 and opened again on 25 September 1965 to the public from October 6, 1996 through until 15 February 2005. The dam was reopened in August 2017, but closed to the public on 1 March 2020.\n\nSee\nList of waterlogged dams in Europe\nList of rivers of the Rhine\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial

[AP Photo\/Bob Woodward]\n\nBALTIMORE -- The first case of a California hiker, identified as a 48-year-old man, has been reported in an area of the Mojave Canyon that is more than 2,000 feet (620 meters) above sea level.\n\nBut, it turns out, the man's mother is a hiker.\n\nA National Park Service worker identified the couple Friday morning as \"his mother and her two daughters.\"\n\nBut the cause of the mysterious death is under investigation by the San Jose Police and San Jose Fire Rescue as well as the National Park Service.\n\nThe man has been identified as a 48-year-old man by a NPS search warrant.\n\nHe was last seen in the Mojave Canyon by his mother and was in Yosemite National Park where he was spotted last week wearing brown hiking shoes.\n\nHe was wearing a ski mask with red and blue lines on it, and looked well drained.\n\nHikers face charges relating to the death of the man, as well as animal cruelty charges.\n\nA spokesman for the San Jose Police Department said in a written statement that the department has an internal investigation.\n\n\"We have not been told how the man was killed. To this date, we want to reassure the public that this unfortunate incident has been covered up,\" added Sgt. Robert Brown.\n\nHe said at least five people have been charged in connection with the death of the man. [AP Photo\/Bob Woodward]\n\nThe man's mother, Mary Kay, told the Associated Press she wanted the investigation complete first and foremost, so her daughter can get out of the house early to seek help.\n\nThe San Jose Unified School District said, 'There is no clear cause of death related to his death,'' spokeswoman Nancy Mauer said.\n\nHe was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.\n\nThe California Department of Fish and Game said Friday that four more people who may have been killed during the last year in the park have been reported.\n\n\"We appreciate the efforts and efforts of members of the public in identifying these deceased individuals,'' it said.\n\nPolice have said at least 16 people have been charged in the death of the man who vanished in mid-September.\n\nOne of the people involved in the death is said to be a hiker, and authorities are searching for those responsible.\n\nThe man's name has not been made available, but he is thought to be about 5 feet (2 metres) tall and weighs about 100 pounds (70 kilograms), with two tattoos on his face and the other on his back, according to authorities.\n\nIn a media release this evening, he said the death was \"finally and fully discovered and it is his responsibility to protect the health and safety of those who are within his territory.\"\n\nThere are at least 14 other bodies found in the park today, including the woman who was seen with her own foot but later pronounced dead and two dogs, which were found dead in an unknown location. Police said they believe the woman died from natural causes, and her injuries were not life threatening.\n\nFearing he might lose his life or his livelihood (though he remains homeless), the man has

{"id":4971,"ended":false,"length":706,"text":"Infamous Second Son sold over one million copies nine days after its launch. = 1973 Pacific hurricane season = The 1973 Pacific hurricane season was an event in tropical cyclone meteorology. The most powerful super cyclones in history affected the US. The most powerful super cyclones in history, the Second Son, hit Hawaii on December 16th, 1962. It formed out of the remnants of an upper-level tropical storm \u2013 the Category 5 Seismic Surgeon (SRS ). The SRS has since been torn through by several hurricanes and continues to remain one of the very hardest hit tropical cyclones on earth and the most influential one on the planet due to its high sustained winds.\n\nThe second ocean storm (S2) was the most destructive to Japan in modern history. In its wake as its center passed to the northwest of its western Gulf coast, the S2 weakened to a tropical storm with sustained winds of 155 mph. By December 19th, Typhoon Matsua was raging in the Southeast Asian country that is in the North Pacific. It reached its peak strength around 3:00pm EDT (20:00 GMT). On February 5th, Typhoon Haru, or Typhoon Aitken, was raging and killed at least 5 people and destroyed over 5,000 buildings.\n\nThe second one (S3) is the most destructive Hurricane in history. However, the S3 was less powerful than originally thought and it failed to hit the northern Pacific coast, making it more prone to hurricane force winds than the Hurricane of 1970s. Since it is far from the only of the storm, it is still expected to cause significant damage to the Pacific coast. The US government and the national administration have said the S3 will pose a threat to US citizens and businesses. There have been major structural concerns around this hurricane, such as widespread flooding and a potential catastrophic tropical storm storm. Japan is the most populous nation on earth.\n\nFailing to act decisively. After the failure of the S2, the US government has said that the federal government should now act decisively to restore the order.\n\nThe UN is already calling for immediate cessation of all tropical cyclone seasons. The UN called for the use of extreme measures to counter the cyclone force.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned on January 2nd that Japan would be compelled to \u201ccancel the S2\u201d. This is a highly sensitive matter because it has become a major issue in international relations. Even though the S3 was considered an extreme move and it should not be disregarded, those of us who still believe in the international order and the protection of human rights should consider it a major risk.\n\nIn late January, the United States decided to move quickly after receiving the official confirmation that the S3 was an extreme risk. When the President confirmed the cancellation, he said \u201cWe shall not let the disaster bring about a disaster in every country.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the S3 cancellation, a growing number of organisations, including the UN Human Rights Office, have denounced the decision. Their calls for a return to the traditional season of hurricane activity were welcomed by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.\n\nHowever, the failure of the Government to act decisively to protect people\u2019s lives and properties is disturbing. First, this disaster is part of a growing trend, where hurricane season is not yet over. It is clear that the disaster is a dangerous and dangerous phenomenon. But the disaster is still more visible in Japan. More importantly, it is still a dangerous and dangerous phenomenon in the wake of the Hurricane of 1991. To blame the Japanese government for this disaster is to undermine any hope for a safe, sustainable and equitable future in the Pacific.\n\nWhat do you think?

{"id":4732,"ended":false,"length":723,"text":"In July 2011, a joint broadcasting deal for Formula One in the United Kingdom was announced between Sky Sports and the BBC. The announcement was controversial, being met with highly negative reactions by the British authorities. As of 2012, the television deal remains in place around Formula One, including coverage of the 2016, 2017 and 2022 winter races.\n\nOn 14 December 2012, the first major event of the year \u2013 Formula 1 Grand Prix of Austria, the UK Grand Prix of Monaco, the final race of the 2013 season in Saudi Arabia, the UK Grand Prix of Spain, the 2014 Formula One World Championship and the UK Grand Prix of Bahrain all took place at Silverstone. On 22 May 2013, the UK Grand Prix of Bahrain was the UK Grand Prix of India and it was the final race of the 2014 season to enter Bahrain. The first major race at Silverstone, at a scale of 1-2\u00a0laps, was the 2013\u201314 season, where the UK Grand Prix is celebrated by racing fans and in most areas, both grand prix and the all-but grand juries. Race attendance was very low, however, in comparison to other Grand Prix tracks such as Hockenheim, and this proved to be a major factor in the cancellation of the British Grand Prix in November 2014 where drivers were banned from the Grand Prix circuits in many jurisdictions.\nIn addition to this, a series of controversies came to light. First, the British F1 teams were ordered out of Formula One due to poor sponsorship of the sport. This was followed by rumours that many of the other teams would not return to Formula One in 2018 and 2019 and therefore the Grand Prix had a limited season. However, the Formula One teams in the United Kingdom and the United States were able to take part.\n\nOn 28 August 2010, Formula One was finally cancelled, following a decision by British F1 governing body FIA to grant permission to the team to play on the Australian GP. This decision was made in the wake of criticism from various rights holders, who were strongly opposed to the team's return.\n\nIn December 2014, the governing bodies of motorsport in the United Kingdom and in the United States formally asked F1 for permission to start at the British Grand Prix in September 2015. On 30 January 2015, F1 granted the team permission to play on the Australian GP.\nIn March 2016, the team moved back to the United States to continue their preparations, and on 21 March 2016, the British Grand Prix returned to Silverstone and its usual setting. This year, Formula One in the United States began with the Grand Prix of Hamilton.\n\nFollowing the decision by FIA for F1 to extend its season to the United States, F1 in the United Kingdom changed the scheduling schedule to the end of the season in 2019. The current schedule features two Grand Prix events \u2013 the inaugural Grand Prix of Australia, which takes place in June, and a later championship match-up \u2013 an event that focuses on the Formula One championship. In addition, the season will continue for all seasons, with no changes in order to keep the current schedule. In addition to these, the decision was also made to stop advertising the Grand Prix events for the general public, but the current schedule is consistent with the current schedule.\nAs of the season's close on 5 March 2019, Formula One in the United Kingdom is scheduled to play the Formula One Grand Prix of India and a second Grand Prix between India and Bahrain in October 2021.

{"id":4302,"ended":true,"length":696,"text":"There were also proposals to use the Gemini spacecraft to conduct long @ - @ duration missions to small, purpose @ - @ built space stations in low @ - @ Earth orbit.\n\nThe launch of the new Gemini rocket allowed NASA to complete a three-year, $8.7 billion mission, while continuing a two-year, $7.8 billion NASA mission that will land the New Mexico-based satellite in orbit of the International Space Station beginning June 24, 2015.\n\nIn addition, NASA also planned to conduct two launches this spring.\n\nThe Gemini launch, scheduled to take place on Monday, May 3, 2015, will serve as a prime launch event for the U.S. Space Force, the joint U.S.-Mexico and Canadian militaries. The astronauts aboard the station will have the opportunity to visit three other space stations, as well as visiting the space stations of a third part of the New Mexico state of Mexican descent, and the Space Launch System (SLS), in Florida. The launch will be completed in the fall of 2015.\n\nThe launch of the New Mexico launch also included a multi-day historic, or mission-specific event for NASA. The launch event in the United States was scheduled for May 3-5, 2015.\n\n\u201cA major goal of our launch is to extend the space program as we have been for decades,\" NASA Administrator Andrew Bixby said in remarks at the launch event. \"NASA's mission objectives are to ensure the safety and security of space programs throughout the world, and our space mission will be able to do just that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs NASA transitions to the post-pandemic era, NASA will continue to invest in the future of space and the planet in order to meet this global challenge,\u201d NASA said in announcing the launch event. \u201cWhile the launch event will honor science and innovation and enhance the mission's legacy, NASA is focusing its focus on mission design and planning to advance science for the future.\"\n\n\u201cThis is the opportunity for NASA and the United States to make a major strategic decision about the space mission that will benefit the next generation of astronauts,\" said Acting Administrator Scott Pruitt at the launch. \"This means we will invest in the next generation of space crews.\"\n\n\u201cIf we are unable to complete the missions scheduled for launch today, we will work with the United States and the Department of Justice, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Homeland Security to ensure our nation is secure for missions, missions, programs and resources that affect every person on Earth,\" NASA Administrator Michael Reiss said. With the launch of the New Mexico launch, NASA will continue to maintain the status quo and accelerate the pace of commercial operations, making the return of the New Mexico launch a major milestone for the agency.\n\n\u201cGemini is the only spaceflight program that has truly reached the end of its lifecycle,\" Director of Mission Control and Security Scott Gottlieb said. \"We are very proud of the NASA astronaut programs that are delivering world-class science and technology over the past 14-plus years. Gemini is a great example of how these programs can do just that \u2014 bringing the future into the present-day space environment.\"\n\nGemini is the third successful launch of the New Mexico rocket since September 16, 2014, when the New Mexico-built Gemini 10 and Gemini 11 rocket launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and made landfall in the Big Bend, Texas.

Do you have a problem with using it?\u201d\n\n2) \u201cYou know that if you had any actual Facebook account, you wouldn\u2019t have any social media accounts.\u201d\n\n3) \u201cSo where are you from where you spend your days and nights?\u201d\n\n4) \u201cI\u2019m the American public defender and the one who made that decision\u2026 I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have any real name.\u201d\n\n5) \u201cYour dad made the decision to come out of retirement\u2026 I don\u2019t care who you are \u201c\n\n5) \u201cBut you\u2019ve said that you don\u2019t have any real real name yet.\u201d\n\n6) \u201cI don\u2019t care what your real name is yet, I would have no clue.\u201d\n\nA \u201creal name\u201d is a legal name with some legal status, and \u201cthe real name would count for what you have.\u201d There are different types of legal names, of course.\n\nIn addition to this exchange, Fox is also sharing a photo of myself in my personal Facebook account, with an Instagram account. The post said that in the next 24 hours, as they were waiting to start streaming the Sony PlayStation 4 show, Fox will be streaming Sony\u2019s \u201cPlayStation Plus\u201d and \u201cXbox Live Extra\u201d versions of the PlayStation four. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\nWhen Fox released the \u201cPlayStation Plus\u201d and \u201cXbox Live Extra\u201d versions of the PlayStation four, they were both tweeted by the company about the potential consequences that would result from being the first person to watch the show. Fox said that he understands it was his responsibility to put the \u201cPlayStation Plus\u201d and \u201cXbox Live Extra\u201d versions live.\n\nA tweet by Sony said that in the next 24 hours they will see the Sony PlayStation 4 show \u201cPlayStation Plus\u201d and \u201cXbox Live Extra.\u201d Sony\u2019s \u201cPlayStation Plus\u201d and \u201cXbox Live Extra\u201d versions are expected to play live during the Sony PlayStation 4 show.\n\nIn order to broadcast the show to the world, Fox is currently renting, streaming, and streaming the Sony PlayStation 4 Sony PlayStation 4 PlayStation and Xbox Live Extra.

More details here.\n\nWhat inspired you to get this set?\n\nIt was a passion for my music.\n\nIt was an outlet for my creative side.\n\nThe only way you had access to this set was from the UK \u2013 there are so many records in this genre.\n\nI remember thinking this set really captures the essence of how I was feeling at the time.\n\nWhat did you do during the period in which you made this set?\n\nDuring the time I\u2019ve made this set, both of those periods were very challenging.\n\nWhat did you learn from this time that brought you to this place?\n\nI know that time is short \u2013 sometimes everything and every moment counts.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for you?\n\nI am just starting the process up, but I\u2019m really looking forward to making the next 2-3 months my home. I wanted to make this album so you can all know I\u2019m home right now!\n\nDo you have any favorite tracks from this set?\n\nI would love to hear from you!\n\nHow did your life change in between those years?\n\nI used to be really into electronic music, so I actually found these songs to take with me whenever I left the house.\n\nI was always in a mood so it was a way to relax.\n\nDo you still enjoy listening to music?\n\nI do, but there is times I\u2019ll come down for a quick bite to eat, then I\u2019m off.\n\nHave you ever thought about something else?\n\nI\u2019m working on a series of documentaries as well as playing a lot at the moment.\n\nWhat are the things you would like to do while you\u2019re here?\n\nMy biggest interest right now is writing songs. I am happy to write stories, but at the moment I can\u2019t write a song. In order to write or edit a story, you need to be able to hold in a pen for a long time.\n\nWhat\u2019s on your mind right now for you right now?\n\nI\u2019m thinking about music that I\u2019ve recently acquired that is similar to what I\u2019m writing right now.\n\nWhat has been your response to this music scene during the years you\u2019re around?\n\nI\u2019ve listened to loads of music since I started growing up \u2013 and it is such a good feeling to be able to experience that sound in order to make music that has made a huge difference to me!\n\nWhat message do you want to share to those who are here waiting for them?\n\nHopefully, you see that you are not alone. Stay tuned for more exciting news and good vibes.\n\nFor more about Daydream, check out the latest album HERE.\n\nLike Twitter to get daily updates on Daydream\n\nInstagram to check out the

{"id":740,"ended":false,"length":709,"text":"Lawton played his first game for Burnley Reserves against Manchester City Reserves in September 1935, and though he struggled in this game he went on to become a regular Reserve team player by the 1940 season \u2013 and the next season he was selected for the First Division teams who would win the title.\n\nHe played against Burnley Reserves, Portsmouth Reserves, West Ham Reserves and Plymouth Athletic Reserves at Burnley on 5 December 1935 and the day before the League Cup against Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nLawton scored both goals from the penalty area and set up a goal for Blackburn Rovers on 38 and 38 minutes in the latter fixture.\n\nBurnley played two games for the League Cup in 1935 against Sunderland on 14 December, but only had one win in their first two games against Sunderland.\n\nHe scored his first goal of the season at Old Trafford on 1 January 1937, just as Burnley won away to Leicester United in the final of the Division Two season.\n\nHe scored his first England goal against Wales in the World Cup at Euro36 in July 1936, scoring the winner against his former team that day.\n\nHe played for England at Euro44 in November 1936 against Wales.\n\nIn December 1936 he was substituted in the second half as Burnley beat Chelsea in the final of the Division Two title\n\nHe made his England debut playing as a midfielder in their World Cup defeat to Italy. He missed the game at Old Trafford with an apparent groin injury but was substituted in the 63rd minute. He set up Burnley's opening goal only nine minutes into the second half with a cross from the right and the England goal-line was opened up by Lawton.\n\nHe scored twice in the League Cup final against Manchester United in 1948, and made a brace in this League Cup defeat by Derby County at Old Trafford in December 48, 1938 to seal the 2\u20132 draw.\n\nHe featured in the Carabao Cup final, against Sheffield Wednesday, and was called up to the first team at Wembley in April 1947. He was again called up in England in December 48 to make his first start for England against West Ham. He scored the winning goal which gave West Ham a 1\u20130 lead over Manchester United in the League Cup final at the Stade de Walsall on 5 March 1948, and provided an assist for Burnley's win.\n\nOn 1 January 1947, after a couple of years in charge, he was appointed Head Coach of the club. On 3 November 1953 he was awarded a \u00a36,600, in a loan from Swansea City, to be used in the 1952 Football League season. With Swansea he had eight players to manage. In the next season he took charge of the team and played the first half of the game against Newcastle United.\n\nHe completed three league goals in the 1957-58 season, a season in which he was sacked by Swansea. However, the following year he was appointed as Director of Football in charge of the FA's official club team, Manchester United.\n\nIn 1959, he took over as Head Coach of Newcastle. At the end of the 1989\u201390 season, he took over as the Manager of Old Trafford.\n\nIn the beginning of 1992 the two-day FA Cup tie between West Ham United and Manchester United was held behind closed doors as it was not allowed by the Football Association, the FA and the government to attend and a large number of spectators attended to watch United from the stands.\n\nDespite his managerial

{"id":3327,"ended":true,"length":734,"text":"Crittenden was drawn back into public service by the Old Court \u2013 New Court controversy. When legislation aimed at providing relief to the state's debtors was struck down by the Kentucky Court of Appeals in June, the Court concluded that it was not in the interest to impose \"new, substantial fees\" on the creditors' interest. Instead, it issued a new debt, the State's first since the Court's decision \u2013 $14.8 billion \u2013 and had the power to extend the grace period to 30 years.\n\nDuring that time, the debtors were required to pay $7.4 billion to the State of Kentucky, including interest, due on their loans. But even when the debtors had been paid out on time, the term of the debt was not extended and the debtors were required to pay off as much as $7.4 billion back on time. That was an increase of $100 million from the $6.2 billion in 2009. Even in the midst of that scandal and its subsequent fallout in court, both the court and the court faced criticism.\n\nThe court's decision was based on a number of factors \u2013 from its own history or legal framework to what was legal. The court said that the debtors' conduct, particularly in its decision, was inexcusable and that the court should be held liable. But as it said in its decision, the debtors were not in the interest of the court and the debtors needed to leave the Court's courtrooms.\n\nThe court also noted that the debtors' conduct also amounted to an abuse of power. Since the court was appointed on the appointment of the Court's chief justice, the court was not legally obligated to provide relief. Instead, it was acting as a \"law\" court in order to prevent debtors from moving into default and to avoid any court costs if the insolvent debtor left the courtrooms prematurely. If the debtors were able to transfer their interest to the Court's new court, the Court would have been able to transfer all of the debtor's interest to the new court. The court then might have had more time to respond to the debtors' request in the next court session.\n\nFor the creditors, though, the Court's decision was not a shock. According to the creditors, the Court was an important step in the government's attempts to control the bankruptcy of the state. After all, the bankruptcy was at the level that creditors, including the courts themselves, could not have considered an insolvent debtor. The court should have been able to hold in a \"dwelling\" condition and provide relief to the creditors by holding them accountable for their actions. And the debtors should have been able to negotiate settlement in writing, without being forced to take the Court's hand or the creditors to hand over their interest.\n\nBut the debtors were not given credit for the financial performance of the debtor. So while the court should have been able to do this during time and place and because the court had the authority to order repayment of all debts, the debtors were required to pay off as much as the debtors had owed. And while the debtors were unable to have a new debt, they were no longer legally obligated to borrow money from the government or use the \"new, substantial fees\" they would have originally been entitled to provide.\n\nThis is yet another example of the Court's disregard for the advice of the legal practitioners at the state legislature. When the state legislature passed the state constitution giving an automatic right to transfer the interest of a state to the new court on a case by case basis, the Courts were forced to take a different view than the Court did. These cases were settled and the Court received no financial benefit from the debtors' transfer.\n\nThe Court's decision has now been thrown out by the Supreme Court.","token_len":784,"entropy":[7.7826,0.4169,0.0048,3.7545,7.3663,4.029,1.2902,7.2338,2.6417,2.4777,1.5794,9.4904,8.4624,6.3123,8.0513,0.8998,9.7226,2.7142,5.2221,10.3292,6.781,0.1094,5.283,5.551,0.6628,2.4129,5.7181,1.5691,6.477,1.1854,0.9318,4.8777,0.0276,1.3687,0.2906,8.5414,3.3663,0.0594,0.0779,1.1229,3.5134,1.5401,1.6333,4.9143,6.1653,0.4518,1.7306,1.3651,2.1197,2.2611,0.3573,2.5154,4.5058,3.8041,3.9858,6.5405,3.6851,5.5175,5.6877,0.9243,0.5527,1.8812,4.436,4.1996,4.1873,1.5332,4.8936,0.1247,1.1568,4.593,0.729,3.0379,5.4828,4.0103,2.5004,4.778,2.2978,3.8223,3.5967,1.3896,4.8944,0.9951,1.0684,4.4638,3.5359,4.4456,0.7651,2.4372,1.1712,2.2835,1.7026,5.8276,2.639,1.5985,0.0633,4.4455,1.0852,4.8346,0.0268,1.9173,3.9844,0.5767,0.4188,0.5948,0.0004,5.8152,2.5326,0.7167,0.2097,1.2624,3.7007,0.1746,2.098,3.3526,0.0647,0.8559,3.216,3.8448,0.3208,2.4488,0.1637,2.4259,0.822,2.0645,3.0135,0.0623,1.3982,3.9139,2.0446,1.4682,5.6966,1.5986,2.0604,3.8527,0.9269,3.0393,4.4106,3.7237,0.7208,1.573,0.0979,3.4064,2.5364,2.1465,4.6808,3.4205,0.9437,0.2684,0.9698,6.5909,0.6734,0.495,1.9792,1.3193,2.3844,1.4847,3.8312,1.3958,2.9431,0.1383,1.1377,1.8809,0.034,0.6191,4.2103,6.2223,1.3792,0.4233,1.2759,2.9865,0.1099,0.5563,0.0271,5.2017,3.3967,0.4844,0.311,3.5636,1.9934,3.9145,3.004,0.4304,1.3983,4.6013,0.2283,1.9199,0.6364,2.6843,3.112,0.1135,2.3808,0.0293,2.3733,5.5342,0.7215,5.6305,3.5302,1.3241,3.9662,0.0007,2.9633,5.6833,3.7889,3.1963,2.9085,3.411,3.4674,4.2328,0.1159,5.587,1.1046,3.4464,0.1518,0.586,4.6188,8.8038,2.63,2.595,0.993,0.0002,1.909,2.7591,1.6779,1.3504,2.2816,4.3214,0.2962,1.3554,3.8794,0.0037,1.6317,2.5548,3.3609,2.5562,3.2211,3.4851,7.6394,4.4062,6.1483,2.8311,4.1523,2.8084,6.6172,3.3133,1.8038,1.6101,3.8073,1.0165,1.4023,2.5605,0.0513,2.2493,6.501,3.5798,3.9001,2.314,4.9622,4.6408,1.3782,0.9479,6.5497,0.0076,0.0313,1.0629,1.3689,1.2588,2.9155,2.2981,3.1113,2.2107,2.5664,2.1432,2.0394,3.8658,2.845,3.2668,0.875,0.4365,1.8843,0.5691,0.9154,1.7114,0.0076,1.7457,1.4518,3.984,1.7554,3.5173,1.1378,0.5578,1.7762,2.0996,2.1117,2.4654,0.0646,6.1778,0.3851,6.9136,0.9125,3.8927,2.8226,3.761,4.2064,1.3932,0.8309,0.0002,1.4313,1.2708,1.3359,3.4706,0.1971,0.8902,1.7923,0.013,2.0903,2.7246,5.3738,4.2093,0.0143,2.6585,2.8625,0.0253,1.8022,1.1693,5.8366,0.8715,2.1964,2.2808,5.2755,4.3429,2.4586,5.9508,0.3482,1.6837,2.6156,0.4658,3.2363,0.2813,0.3947,1.4125,2.2534,2.106,2.1262,4.0805,1.9911,0.0337,3.7227,1.5144,2.653,2.5204,0.0639,1.1964,1.2856,5.0716,1.2776,0.9121,1.8361,4.7057,5.1368,3.7967,3.3471,2.6835,0.0236,3.9656,3.4964,0.006,0.1469,4.8817,2.6538,5.6989,2.6203,1.7177,3.3668,3.4462,4.3483,3.6248,4.2481,1.6077,6.1404,1.5321,2.3294,3.3744,0.6566,1.1885,1.3864,8.2516,0.1724,4.9654,0.5799,1.068,0.0082,2.2327,3.749,0.0122,6.5466,1.2499,3.4732,1.6665,1.3173,2.5284,0.8842,3.7941,1.4261,0.6151,1.1342,1.5401,1.2937,1.7164,2.9851,1.6393,0.0126,4.785,3.567,0.7797,0.6226,4.3007,0.0158,1.9476,1.2948,0.3407,0.7252,0.3844,0.9597,2.7673,1.1295,4.3698,6.5905,0.8793,2.9355,4.4894,2.7069,0.1525,4.6797,0.317,0.4596,0.7342,0.0044,0.3836,3.0847,4.9335,1.8544,3.9545,2.1731,2.3438,0.79,0.3379,0.0002,5.1574,1.5288,3.1044,0.4345,4.6579,0.0305,0.529,2.4999,0.4975,0.3735,0.9999,2.2896,2.1474,5.3444,0.4508,4.6868,0.0008,1.299,4.5491,1.5232,0.7084,1.2901,2.4274,4.6369,3.1284,2.3608,0.9444,1.5156,5.7462,0.1826,4.4584,0.0289,4.3513,0.84,5.4885,2.2185,0.9206,0.611,0.8049,4.6309,0.8531,0.003,1.1703,2.7675,2.4038,5.8641,0.6,5.9052,3.937,2.696,4.9228,2.8359,0.6934,5.7275,3.289,0.0384,3.1107,2.5093,3.9271,5.5074,5.2748,2.877,0.2722,0.6581,1.698,2.1712,2.0364,5.4818,0.4934,1.9143,1.4053,0.0147,4.2665,5.911,4.1117,4.2118,5.4622,5.3625,0.1799,1.1511,4.2683,3.8718,3.469,0.5123,0.6559,0.4634,0.7665,4.3285,4.8568,2.0288,2.279,0.8995,0.7928,1.1508,0.442,3.9368,1.7576,2.4418,0.0018,2.7648,0.5075,0.8125,0.5505,0.0125,5.4798,6.2497,3.8816,4.3643,2.4495,4.0691,3.1475,1.8016,0.2796,3.9416,2.418,2.9419,0.2108,4.9814,3.4829,4.3564,4.5334,2.3646,5.292,1.3617,0.6895,2.9472,0.6228,0.3176,0.0002,2.2623,1.1072,2.851,0.0018,2.0202,0.8344,4.7245,4.9901,0.3108,1.9009,5.1975,4.1142,0.3142,0.2805,2.0354,1.059,4.6893,3.7659,0.3874,1.5714,4.6769,0.1648,1.0368,0.4011,0.0073,5.0034,2.9748,6.6845,5.1834,5.1515,2.1363,4.6762,5.8943,1.2194,2.7506,2.4641,2.1721,1.9484,0.2026,4.313,3.34,0.8281,3.3803,2.3156,1.0445,0.9327,1.0399,0.0015,0.7455,4.9085,0.0706,0.9049,2.9717,2.4264,0.1357,0.1793,3.1092,1.4119,0.0509,2.598,3.0677,0.9677,2.5187,3.076,0.5032,1.1909,0.0019,0.9312,4.4488,0.0244,5.5803,2.3499,3.862,2.7139,2.6013,1.4015,0.6618,5.1289,0.0499,4.9264,1.1173,0.0458,7.3359,1.589,1.3998,0.2834,2.7791,2.8166,4.4972,1.1616,5.5752,2.797,1.5811,0.0598,0.691,0.1247,2.4829,4.0896,0.5744,6.4307,1.3857,1.629,0.0026,7.5442,0.844,0.5609,0.0001,3.8608,1.8366,5.6842,0.0186,0.9739,0.0571,0.8621,1.7268,0.3146,4.6312,0.2067,0.4026,7.137,0.2638,1.1234,3.4452,7.7261,3.7475,0.3406,3.9244,5.6304,0.8094,3.9404,0.8354,2.4714,0.3682,0.9363,1.7227,3.2392,3.4257,7.3486,5.6324,3.8526,1.6583,0.3082,6.5504,2.6923,5.

{"id":4821,"ended":true,"length":694,"text":"In 1883 the company Burns Philp started a regular shipping service and the number of tourists gradually increased. By 1932, with the regular tourist run of SS Morinda, tourism became the second most relevant factor on the local economy.\n\nIn 1885 the company Burns Plough, the biggest of the company, started operations. Today it employs around 500-700 people.\n\nIn 1887 Burns Philp started to establish more diversified services, opening its own brewery and a specialised wine shop. Today, it owns several Italian businesses in the wine industry.\n\nThe largest trading business for Italy and Spain\n\nIn 1888 it was launched by the founders of two industrial enterprises, Burns Philp and Burns Gascoigne.\n\nToday there are 694 million people in the world who work to help to improve people\u2019s lives in other countries and communities.\n\nToday the industry is the largest business in Europe.\n\nAccording to the International World Trade Organisation (WWTO), Europe will register as the world\u2019s largest exporter of pharmaceutical chemicals. The industry accounts for over 80% of global pharmaceutical sales and is estimated to make around \u20ac35 billion of sales, increasing to \u20ac40 billion by 2015.\n\nAccording to the World Healthcare Association (WHA), the European drug market valued at \u20ac1.1 billion in 2007 is projected to be an international value chain of around 3 billion drugs.\n\nIn 1992, Burns Gascoigne invented the first portable bottle cap and bottle of water bottles. Since then this has been instrumental in bringing the demand for alcohol to its highest level ever.\n\nSince that time the company has opened a specialised cheese shop in the town of Casa Sant\u2019 Amor, a wine and beer museum in the town of Casa Domenico, and opened a restaurant, two bars and a book store, among others.\n\nIn the 1990s the company opened another specialised manufacturing facility in the town of Genoa of Francescino, and announced that it now has more than 500 manufacturing units.\n\nIn 2014 the company announced that it is set to start manufacturing alcohol and beer in the town of Genoa as well as in nearby regions, with a total turnover of \u20ac10 million.\n\nToday the company produces its own brand of sparkling wine and beer, which has been sold in over 20 countries around the world. It is one of the finest brands in Italy, France, Germany and Spain. In Italy, it is made from its own grapefruit extract and uses a very low calorie alcohol which can be made to serve beverages like hot water, coffee, teas or tea or even to drink from a glass. Its first taste of its original wine made by the company is a real tasting experience.\n\nThe company also produces sparkling water with two glasses of sparkling grapefruit juice and a wine glass, which contains 0% alcohol. However, the company says that the bottle is only suitable for drinking in a bottle because it does not contain water.\n\nIn 2001, when the company decided to invest a new \u20ac50 million in the town of Genoa, the Italian government gave the company a public debt of approximately \u20ac5 million, and the company was able to raise \u20ac5 million by selling its own shares.\n\nToday the company develops and manufactures its own brand of sparkling water, with the aim of opening a new speciality factory and a new production line in Genoa (which has almost 60 employees).\n\nIn 2001, when Burns

{"id":759,"ended":false,"length":749,"text":"Johnston was entered as a competitor in the second series of Britain's Got Talent by his mother. He passed the first public audition, singing `` Pie Jesu `` from Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'The Jungle.' She was pleased to hear he sang a much stronger rendition of the song, saying that ``the audience didn't have to hear it.'' ''Johnston, the world famous'songs critic'' of the song, had no choice but to tell Lloyd Webber not to play the role because he was too old. ''I said to him don't. It's my job to make sure he and I play every one of his songs,'' Leweless said.``The kids were so happy.'' One had even got her own copy of The Jungle in her own hand. ''The only way to remember those four people is if I make it at home.'' ''We don't have the space here,'' a third joked. ''We have to go to the bank and get some money.''\n\nIf Johnston was to be eligible for British's Got Talent, he had to be 16 years old and have a high school GPA in his class. Not bad, given that only seven of the nine judges were 16 or 17 years old when Johnston took the stage.\n\nThe judges asked where Johnston was, what went on behind the scenes in the house and what they had seen. Then they tried to figure out who played the role of Jukunneh. To this day, ''there is a lot of mystery.''\n\nWhat Johnston didn't know was that he was a teenager. He had to go to school for the next three years and learn to be a singer. ''At my age, it was a lot of fun,'' Leweless says. ''We were young children, but it was easy to get into it.''\n\nJohnston's mother, a law student, would often talk about getting children involved. When she was 12, she came home with her 16-year-old daughter, then married a 17-year-old boy. Their daughters lived in a hotel near their home. Johnston later told his daughter in the audience how much she cared for him. He showed her his daughter's portrait on display, and her daughter, now 17, would paint it in her memory. ''I always wanted things for them to do when they were little. That way they would always be able to see what a good kid they were,'' Leweless says. ''I was always going out to eat and drink and watch everything else.''\n\nThe first time Johnston met his family, he was 11. His mother had been a care provider. In the next few years he would see family members at the hospital. ''He didn't want his parents to see him because it was too late,'' Leweless says. ''They didn't know anything about him.''\n\nIn those years they also had the experience of watching Johnston in the famous television show ''Tales of the Princess'', ''The Twilight Zone,'' ''The Last House On Good Neighbors'' and ''The Bachelorette''. Now many of those programs are still watched in the United States, and the movie industry and the U.S. government are now heavily affected by their productions. Some of the biggest television dramas were based on his stories about his life, says Leweless. Johnston and his wife of 25 years, Katelyn, are working as producers of ''The Twilight Zone,'' ''The Last House On Good Neighbors'' and ''The Bachelorette.''\n\n\"He's our hero,'' Leweless says.

{"id":3064,"ended":true,"length":679,"text":"A tropical depression is the lowest category that the Japan Meteorological Agency uses and is the term used for a tropical system that has wind speeds not exceeding 33 knots ( 38 mph ; 61 mph ) \u2013 the best known category for tropical storms.\n\nTropical Depression F, commonly referred to as \u201cF\u201d or \u201cF-10\u201d, was one of the most active tropical storms in 2019, hitting southeast of the coast of southern Japan with gusty winds. It was the second-highest category for tropical storms in 2019 and set a record as the largest tropical storm to strike the Japanese coast in 2019.\n\nThe strongest tropical storm in 2019 is named after the Japanese ocean. One of Fujir\u014d Noguchi\u2019s strongest and most active cyclones formed on July 27 to form F. The powerful one was named after a tropical storm \u2014 known as F-10.\n\nHere\u2019s how we calculate the overall category and how much is too strong and too slow in most areas to have a serious impact on tropical cyclone events in Japan.\n\nDirectionally Warming\n\nAs a tropical storm form, or peak of activity, typically forms during and after landfall in Japan\u2019s east coast, which means it takes off and travels north where it is likely to be most active. This means it may produce tropical cyclones that would not receive as much strength or power as they do in the east coast.\n\nThe highest and highest category for strong tropical storm activity in 2019 is Fujir\u014d Noguchi of the Fujir\u014d Noguchi Bay. The strong one was named for the area where Noguchi was the first to experience tropical storms occur. Fujir\u014d Noguchi is known for heavy rain rain.\n\nThe most powerful category for powerful tropical cyclones this year is \u201cC\u201d, the highest category for tropical storms in the U.S. This category has the potential to produce an even less catastrophic effect than Fujir\u014d Noguchi.\n\nWarmest Tropical Storm\n\nBy the end of 2019, tropical storms had weakened enough to produce a Category 10 storm. So it would be safe to assume the strongest category at the end of 2019 to be called a \u201cW\u201d or \u201cW\u201d Tropical Storm.\n\nFor the most part, Fujir\u014d Noguchi has not developed a major area of activity, and despite that, it has not experienced an absolute loss of tropical storm activity since July 9. This may indicate that it is a tropical storm capable of creating significant damage or destruction.\n\nWinds\n\nAs for the intensity and duration of tropical storms, the wind speeds of F-10 and the overall direction of the storms will determine if or where tropical cyclone activity is most likely to take place. F-10 comes in the late afternoon hours as an offshore storm, while F-10 and F-10 get in the afternoon hours and become more widespread as the wind reaches gusts of 50 to 50 mph.\n\nAccording to CNN\u2019s tropical tracker, the wind speeds will vary depending on the level of activity, as the storm may have formed in the Atlantic Ocean but moved farther and deeper than any active tropical storm. For this reason, some forecast models suggest that the winds may continue to beat F, as wind speeds on both the high- and low-pressure fronts will be moving away from the southern parts of the atmosphere.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the wind speeds will remain much stronger in some areas than on other areas. These same characteristics will impact the intensity of tropical cyclone activity when the winds cross the Gulf Coast. As such, the strongest tropical cyclone activity will likely be located in some areas of the Gulf coast, while the strongest category for wind speeds should be located farther to the north.","token_len":786,"entropy":[11.6242,4.1799,1.8954,2.7189,5.2577,6.1404,3.8776,3.1922,8.5759,0.473,0.0019,0.0332,4.6064,4.6102,1.5818,2.407,7.7636,0.4365,1.3742,1.5204,2.2095,5.2192,1.3684,2.5376,8.812,1.6319,5.8137,0.8007,6.4588,2.2814,1.5318,12.648,1.6692,7.6214,6.4176,2.7474,1.8154,6.5173,2.0897,5.5207,3.0326,2.2761,1.9258,1.2693,1.0703,0.4796,1.3497,0.0039,5.0153,0.414,0.0254,2.9965,7.8109,6.8723,11.6388,1.5543,0.0112,0.0262,12.7244,7.6505,2.3671,7.5916,7.2712,3.2285,1.678,0.8356,0.531,5.0849,6.2492,2.1934,0.8225,0.5197,3.2959,3.3099,0.0224,0.3044,1.1398,4.1839,1.1303,1.8887,1.084,12.0232,1.5765,5.5245,6.8061,3.0464,1.9946,3.701,0.1963,4.6144,0.7108,3.1758,2.8073,5.2261,0.0815,2.8876,1.9199,1.0533,1.8855,2.0194,1.7353,1.8753,0.5721,2.3552,0.5138,0.3693,1.2836,3.4832,2.1385,5.3011,0.9276,0.6738,5.6044,0.6193,3.2591,0.8613,0.6184,2.1644,1.9106,1.748,2.3884,1.5554,0.8775,5.8483,0.4168,0.86,0.0003,1.8851,4.7688,0.7975,0.343,1.678,3.7459,3.9736,4.7133,3.0385,1.0239,2.0483,7.3879,3.2465,6.8568,0.433,9.3009,7.1819,4.5503,5.2905,3.99,0.9452,9.9772,5.4788,3.6186,0.998,4.3193,1.4527,3.3649,5.3903,0.0818,8.1265,1.9574,2.8081,3.6478,6.3582,10.1842,5.1936,3.2703,2.6837,4.4605,7.1738,2.675,0.9689,0.7274,2.6062,4.2069,1.0254,6.6573,5.1945,0.2509,2.7801,2.0684,1.3985,2.9629,0.7728,0.0003,7.234,9.3502,1.2065,0.7121,3.8444,3.6375,4.3046,0.9765,6.8724,2.5463,3.7675,3.0121,3.2176,3.8357,5.3375,4.4365,4.0341,0.6441,4.2815,4.1933,5.1004,3.6559,2.5852,4.265,1.1268,3.7259,0.3728,0.5008,3.4403,1.3576,0.7127,5.8934,2.079,0.5472,0.7705,0.38,0.0003,5.7924,4.3763,5.1109,4.9519,1.0218,1.2259,0.0003,4.3044,2.4246,1.4072,0.5821,8.013,0.9958,6.1426,8.0174,3.5439,4.3093,0.365,7.751,4.6019,2.9073,5.6041,0.585,6.7892,2.1096,1.7814,9.7706,0.2469,2.6542,5.5799,0.1874,1.0544,4.0888,3.1055,1.5235,4.7201,4.8121,2.9596,3.4731,2.297,6.4375,0.4488,2.0938,3.7184,0.0363,2.7806,3.9404,0.509,0.5952,2.7157,2.004,1.7202,3.3938,6.4196,3.176,0.6614,0.9056,1.8781,4.8622,2.8205,7.7298,2.7726,0.1823,5.8047,2.7609,2.5514,1.0033,1.9038,2.6988,0.9047,1.0063,3.1542,0.843,1.1784,0.6935,0.0002,2.206,4.5707,4.5191,3.8223,3.5398,2.2533,7.2086,0.2642,2.3645,0.8652,1.1847,3.271,1.0928,7.8368,0.045,0.0073,0.1308,0.0041,0.0002,4.8984,1.7216,2.7666,0.2556,0.0368,2.3436,0.0445,0.0013,6.6319,4.63,1.8563,3.9254,4.8858,1.2936,0.084,2.9286,1.3914,5.0352,1.654,4.3545,0.0653,0.0007,2.1854,3.262,2.7169,1.2747,5.0079,2.3814,3.0494,10.4292,0.8839,2.7992,0.017,0.0054,0.1921,0.0031,0.0003,1.8646,3.4037,0.6386,6.765,1.7616,6.7721,3.5873,0.7536,0.0002,1.7614,2.9473,2.9,2.0254,0.6977,6.2353,0.0646,2.1256,1.3599,7.0137,0.0706,0.3225,5.7454,0.3075,4.9969,0.995,2.7406,2.4811,2.6643,3.3763,0.4494,1.0693,0.6119,1.1755,0.8873,1.5902,3.9672,0.0026,0.0059,0.1555,1.6274,0.6483,2.5411,2.6866,4.0238,0.1106,2.3882,4.8715,2.4,7.8601,7.3533,4.3226,1.4191,4.0186,0.0086,0.008,0.0564,0.0011,0.0004,0.7743,0.971,0.0002,4.8392,0.8803,3.2602,1.2434,0.3532,1.786,0.0002,6.1007,1.841,0.5328,0.001,2.8411,0.1647,2.2609,1.5298,5.4077,4.8813,4.8862,0.2684,2.963,2.3046,1.2646,4.8249,1.6829,1.4837,6.3133,3.3303,3.8915,0.8362,4.4318,0.1215,1.0754,2.836,1.3832,2.2439,5.8348,1.553,0.5919,0.0082,0.9342,5.928,1.5598,5.1425,2.4303,6.242,0.181,1.3288,0.6866,0.4943,3.0591,0.4313,0.0251,1.323,4.0887,0.2639,3.285,0.1291,0.4557,0.6294,0.0002,4.6794,1.8442,1.6499,0.2142,0.1419,5.4799,0.0312,0.0089,0.0191,0.0011,0.0002,2.6323,2.7027,4.0123,1.5343,3.0722,6.6952,0.588,2.8407,2.4512,2.291,6.9435,3.5285,0.4837,0.6996,1.2645,4.1427,3.1639,3.2661,6.1619,4.5958,0.4373,2.007,1.5653,0.115,2.7938,4.4073,4.4642,1.524,2.9858,4.0672,3.0777,0.553,1.4619,1.0615,3.3184,2.0253,0.6333,5.6163,0.0113,4.0414,3.3645,3.669,3.4284,4.077,1.3653,0.4047,0.0002,6.1216,2.4938,1.5125,0.0002,3.5587,6.3913,1.0565,5.2419,2.7292,2.7735,0.0651,0.7593,1.1649,0.4099,1.8727,4.2829,2.0212,2.2033,5.3481,1.5711,0.1689,1.7449,3.6495,5.1219,4.9223,0.2634,1.1424,3.8863,4.3865,2.4112,4.3037,3.2483,3.5006,2.9616,0.6215,0.7909,0.1444,1.5467,2.9151,0.6809,0.5138,4.1409,0.1089,0.4202,4.6081,0.0946,0.0343,6.8707,0.7136,2.6145,4.9975,1.102,4.6547,4.5372,3.9597,4.1638,2.8217,1.0525,1.7661,0.252,0.0418,0.1008,2.3573,0.4038,0.0238,0.1501,10.863,3.4936,0.4886,2.097,2.6331,2.8315,4.103,2.7556,5.0659,1.315,2.1973,2.6668,4.5139,7.8593,1.7535,1.1299,3.0709,1.4051,3.7885,0.9127,0.7379,0.6007,0.0002,5.9748,0.029,9.2542,6.5489,0.1922,0.0586,3.5694,8.0572,0.7025,1.7205,2.4895,1.1348,3.9694,2.1303,1.4733,0.0429,0.5988,4.9033,0.0517,2.49,2.1347,2.8035,2.7953,3.5425,4.5537,2.6047,5.9798,1.9382,1.1729,5.7561,0.9108,4.5913,4.4308,4.8748,4.8423,4.6752,5.0888,5.3562,5.9032,0.2747,0.5721,1.1914,4.3049,3.8626,0.4523,0.0701,4.1262,6.2608,1.3216,2.3893,0.8805,1.5126,2.9445,2.0299,4.0358,0.1949,7.2791,2.7352,7.6878,2.9825,4.1205,0.2761,5.0627,4.8119,2.8224,4.6615,2.9789,0.3241,0.0572,0.0062,3.3419,1.6867,1.8954,2.3556,5.9224,3.9552,0.0482,0.7001,5.9081,4.9838,0.0135,0.4383,7.3616,0.7634,0.3572,0.0002,4.8762,7.7612,0.1192,0.0096,1.3983,0.0794,1.9625,0.1401,1.8323,2.5923,0.6863,2.2556,4.6167,4.44

{"id":1601,"ended":true,"length":708,"text":"The rules of track athletics or of track events in athletics as observed in most international athletics competitions are set by the Competition Rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ).\nEach year, the IAAF reviews the rules of track athletics or of track athletics in all races and offers the appropriate governing body (ASF), an approval procedure for the governing body of each race and event.\nThe ASF is governed by a Commission, chaired by the IAAF Board of Directors, and comprising a number of technical experts from around the world and is composed of a number of countries, including Italy and Spain.\nIt covers all forms of athletics, including individual and team sport, professional and international levels (i.e. national, state, regional and international events), professional and international championships.\nIt does not have an official position; nor has there always been a need to provide the relevant official body.\nAn analysis of ASF rules revealed that the IAAF rules for the 2019\/20 season were in most areas, while the rest of the governing body followed closely in terms of governing body selection and approval.\nThe governing bodies listed below were made available on official ASF website for the second and third quarters of the academic year. All the ASF rules were submitted to the IAAF Board of Directors.\nRule\n1.1. All IAAF events (i.e. individual and team event) must take place in the same course, event or track as they have been held in the past.\nRule 2.5. To obtain approval from the IAAF, each ASF event must be deemed to be complete and free-for-all and must have the following qualification rules:\n\u2013 Complete the programme without any interruption of the programme and without any interruption.\nRule 3. All ASF events must first have qualified race crews so that the first-half qualifying qualifying period is complete.\nRule 4. No athlete must register under each of the prescribed criteria.\nRule 5. No sport for the purpose of track events will be permitted to be played in the centre of one of any of the above prescribed sections as provided for in the regulations in the ASF Rules 2020.\nRule 6. No race must be allowed to be played in the event hall.\nRule 7. No sport for which there would be no spectators within the hall will be allowed.\nRule 8. No sport for which there would be no spectators within the hall will not be permitted.\nRule 9. All ISF events should be carried out in accordance with international competition rules and competitions code (i.e. European, Commonwealth, Asian, North-South) or international Olympic and Paralympic calendar rules (i.e. IOC, European Union, British, Australian).\nRule 10. No individual Olympic and Paralympic body shall sponsor any race and the performance of any individual Olympic event as an annual or regional sport; the IOC and\/or other relevant body may give any sanction or order such as approval, and such sanction or order may be binding on the respective event hall.\nRule\n1.2. If an athlete has obtained the approval of the IAAF Board of Directors, the IAAF is notified and the competition committee and the governing body may decide if they need assistance.\nRule 2.3. The IAAF Board of Directors decides, by appropriate mechanism, if the events are to be held in the same track and field or track as they have been held in the previous academic year and the IAAF is to appoint a new chairperson of the governing body.\nRule 3.

{"id":1414,"ended":false,"length":633,"text":"The name of Djedkare Isesi's principal wife is not known. An important queen consort whose name is lost was very likely the owner of a large pyramid complex located to the northeast of the city center, known as \"The Village.\" The area was a major commercial and commercial center, and was known as a tourist destination. Today, it is also known as the \"Djedkare Island.\" A complex of three-story buildings containing over 300 apartments, with many of the buildings destroyed by earthquakes. It is also mentioned as the \"Djedkare Island of Djingla\" because by the time of the Spanish independence, \"Djedkare\" was only a name for an area of approximately  above the sea level below the surface of Djedkare. The island is home to four islands, making Djedkare the \"Swansea\" of the island.\n\nHistory\nThe village was founded on October 13th, 1511\u20131511 by the late Frida Kocsi. It served as a settlement due to its original independence. She was the third wife of the king, Frida Kocsi, a former king of Denmark. She was originally known as Delta Kocsi (1628\u20131689) and later as Delta L. Pou, but was actually Degas in French. During his reign, she married Frida Kocsi at a court in the city center, and their children were the firstborn daughter of him. Later known as Delta L. Pou, Delta Pou remained very close with the king for the rest of her life. When she was captured by the king by her younger brother, Frida L. Pou, the two were separated and fled to the island where Delta Kocsi had been born. The king made many friends with Delta Pou during his early life. After the separation, Delta L. Pou was transferred to the Isle of Man and later to the Islands of the Americas, where she still lives. Delta Pou did not leave Ireland until 1737 when she returned to Ireland. The Isle of Man in 1637 became one kingdom as well as the Isle of Man between 19 and 20 September 1640.\n\nAs a result of the Irish Rebellion in 1646, and the consequent Irish civil war, Delta L. Pou was captured by the island at the start of 1647, and she was left there until she returned to her family and died after her death. Later, after her return to Ireland, Delta Pou and her children became involved in military warfare. With the defeat of the Portuguese and Spanish colonies which followed the independence of Ireland in May 1646, Delta Pou also became involved in the fighting between England and England in Ireland. She was captured by the King's army in 1750, while there she was captured by the Irish in the Isle of Man 1670. After the war, she and her children and five of his sons were sold to the island, and in 1667 she was reunited with her son. In 1678 Delta Pou was released and went to Europe with her mother Delta L. Pou. This was her last life-or-death struggle as Delta L. Pou was one of Ireland's most feared figures. Delta Pou's death was a catalyst for many of her supporters to turn away from the country to Ireland where they had already formed their identity.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n   www.informanc.com\/article\/14011157\n \nhttp:\/\/www.informanc.com\/article\/14011078\n\nExternal links\n\n Delta Pou: Ireland's most feared women of the 1620s\n  www.informanc.com\/article\/14011087\n Delta L.

{"id":2939,"ended":false,"length":726,"text":"In the Early Middle Ages, Plato's picture of the heavens was dominant among European philosophers, which led Christian thinkers to question the role and nature of the world @ - @ soulful_phoenix #not-the-earth#E2 #not-the-earth#Amen @ \u2013 (@ (@BethanyRoseC) January 5, 2020\n\nThis week, \"A New Way To Discover & Treat Our Earth\" will take viewers up into the ages on the issue of the universe, and help them explore the possibility that this cosmos will be a lot different today, if nothing else.\n\nIt will look at both the ancient and newly found universe.\n\nBut the viewers won't be able to see that it is the opposite of what was seen in ancient times. Instead, they will have to be willing to be at the crossroads of a new understanding.\n\nWhy? Because in ancient times, the gods of antiquity had to be willing to sacrifice their human and animals for their own purposes, both for themselves and for the earth.\n\nThe gods also had to sacrifice their natural resources, with the exception of grain and oil or coal.\n\nThe ancient gods and the gods of antiquity were at the crossroads of being as human as they were; however, this is exactly the historical perspective that we will be trying to explore here.\n\nWhy would we want to explore it at all? What is there to do that we know might not have been possible before? Why would we want it to last this far after all?\n\nThe most powerful way that we can understand the cosmos and the stars that are being drawn into it is to be able to explain the ways in which cosmic power can be derived.\n\nFor me, the most important factor in understanding the cosmos is also the reason why this isn't so surprising.\n\nThis isn't a new science.\n\nIt's just about how we interpret the universe and the cosmos. We understand all of the various concepts and concepts associated with it, which is how we understand how the cosmos might behave in any given universe.\n\nAs we are exploring that cosmos in the ancient ages, it still needs a lot of work to make it any closer to what we know today.\n\nUnfortunately, while the cosmological idea of what makes up the cosmos was just an idea when it was first put to work, it has slowly become a lot more and more recent.\n\nThere's a lot to be thankful for in life and in the universe, especially since in a previous era, you might have noticed some problems.\n\nToday, we need to find a solution to these problems. In the long run, we have to work towards something that the cosmos is also making more progress towards.\n\nIf there is a solution, there has gotta be a way to make it happen, which means solving some problems around the cosmos that we don't understand anymore.\n\nAt this point, there's no real easy way to do that, because all that we're already talking about are some new concepts that we have been introduced to, like the Sun, the stars (or whatever the hell these stars are), and the cosmos...\n\nThe idea of the cosmos may or may not be what you've been thinking about recently.\n\nHowever, we can still appreciate things with new eyes. All the colors are still there and there are so many new things to learn in the cosmos.\n\nIt's time to do something really special.\n\nIt's our \"New Way To Learn\".

{"id":2526,"ended":true,"length":729,"text":"The gray wolf is generally monogamous, with mated pairs usually remaining together for life, unless one of the pair dies. Upon the death of one mated wolf, pairs are quickly re-introduced, usually by new mates. Although, most wolves adopt into their home territory, the female wolf rarely adopts its new mate.\nIt also can be hard to identify wolves when their populations are increasing. A study of wolves in Oregon revealed that the percentage of wolves with non-nunabuled nunabuled fur, which is the color and size of fur that is absent in mated animals and that is also present on non-nunabuled fur, is much more high compared to wolves with the black wolf.\nThe gray wolf may also have a different breed than the black wolf. If not male, then its breed is different, although males are usually male. As wolf traits often change over time, the breed may have a more pronounced gender difference in many states.\nThe red wolf is in most areas, while the red wolf may have a more pronounced gender difference. For example, the white wolf may have a long breed that is shorter, or possibly larger. The female wolf may have a shorter breed that is long and may also have larger teeth and larger jaws.\nTidal wolves exist throughout the United States. Although many blue wolves may have large mouths, most blue wolves are small. If the predator or hunter tries to use them, they can be stopped. In both cases, the predator or hunter can use the red wolf to distract them from killing the other wolf.\nThe color and size of the wolf are both important in both cases. According to the study, the percentage of wolves with gray hooded coats increases the percentage of each wolf that is in winter hibernation.\nA study of gray wolf hounds in New Hampshire found that when winter is over, the white wolf will hibernate for several months. This results in the fur coat being significantly lighter and the eyes of the hounds to be less affected by night hunting. However, when winter is over, the tail feathers become heavier and the ears and lower chin start to become smaller. The hounds may still become vulnerable to predators, though it is possible that they will not be able to kill any coyotes.\nAlthough it is often difficult to trace, hounds in Massachusetts have a distinct color spectrum. Many types of hounds have a distinct coloring spectrum and a distinct color spectrum. The color spectrum of a hound is not always reflected in any color or tint of the hound\u2019s shirt, so if you are picking your pups up, it is highly likely that your hounds will be the color of the hound that you see the most.\nBecause hounds can often be mistaken for other animals such as rabbits or cats, you can easily suspect the color of a hound. Because hounds are characterized by a long tail and neck, they typically do not give off a particular scent because they are often black and white.\nIf you have an hound that you are interested in picking up, you should pick it up right away. You should also call a local shelter before picking up your hound and if possible leave the trail and go to the shelter before putting it back together.\nThe most common problem with hounds is being mistaken for cats and dogs. The reason is that they were bred to stay and breed, so they didn\u2019t get adopted by owners who were not good at maintaining their quality of life. Once the hound of a new breed is adopted, it typically won\u2019t stay with the new hound.\nIt is highly likely that you may be seeing these hounds during your first season of hound breeding. If you are looking for the next dog, maybe the next time you find your red wolf, try to get the second

{"id":2219,"ended":true,"length":715,"text":"It was in Dallas that Nash established himself as a formidable point guard, beginning a decade as one of the game's top players. During his first year as a Maverick ( the '60s, the '70s), Nash averaged 29.3 points and 11.3 rebounds a game. His first All-Star appearance (in 60 games for Dallas, the '73 season) was at the expense of Marc-Andre James ( who missed the entire '76 season due to an injury ), which led to one of the best seasons in NBA history. During his second season with the Mavericks, Nash and the Mavericks reached an all-time high of 50 points in two games.\n\nBut the biggest moment had to turn from the NBA to the NHL in the 1990s. Nash made a decision to turn to the Chicago Blackhawks for some help in his career and after a season in which the Blackhawks went 0-9 in the NHL, Nash decided to leave the team and join Chicago. He averaged 25 points and 5.6 rebounds in a career which would have been more than enough for a full season of basketball to begin. He would go on to sign for the Minnesota Wild for only $1,000 and would join the Blackhawks where he averaged 18.7 points, 5.0 rebounds, 3.0 assists. The next season he would go on to win five NHL championships. When he returned home from his home season in Arizona, the Blackhawks were still in third place in the Canadian league. He finished his NHL career with 15 career finals points and 11 career finals rebounds.\n\nDespite his struggles with injuries to his hands at the start of free-hand, Nesbitt was the star in the series and in the playoffs. Nash recorded 17 points and eight rebounds in the series against the Maple Leafs. His 15 points and four rebounds in the postseason are the most points by a player under 30 years of age in the NHL. His 14 points were the most in a series with the Maple Leafs of all time. Not to be outdone by DeMar DeRozan, the NBA superstar who saw his best season with the Nets in 1993\/94 and led all scorers with 20 points as they advanced to the playoffs with a 117-118 rout of the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nThe Maple Leafs played in front of a limited crowd as he faced plenty of questions from his teammates about his ability to create an immediate impact at the level he established a decade prior. In the playoffs, Nash shot an astonishing 41.9 percent from the field and had 35 points in a 97-90 road loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs. In his return, Nash put up 18 points and nine rebounds. In the playoffs he scored 16.3 points and 9.9 rebounds in a 119-111 win over the Ottawa Senators. This was his final season with the Maple Leafs. He would stay with the team until the NBA Draft in 1992. His final NBA season was in Toronto in 1995-96 and a career-high seven games and his playoff streak of seven games were an NBA-high. In 1997, Nash was selected in the first round by the San Jose Sharks and was selected in the first round by the Montreal Canadiens. He became the first player in the NHL to score at least 10 points in each of their series with the Senators and was part of a playoff run that made him a key contributor to both Montreal and the Maple Leafs and ended the franchise's four-game championship record from 1997-98. Nash would end the decade strong with a record of 17 straight MVP awards along with a World Series championship with the St. Louis Blues.\n\nAfter a successful NBA career, Nash enjoyed a successful free-agent season while recovering from a torn ACL.

{"id":444,"ended":false,"length":775,"text":"Hellblazer was set in a contemporary world, albeit a world of magic and supernatural conflict behind the scenes. Although issue 14 made a passing reference to superheroes, the series since developed its own superpowers, the ability to destroy things. Not sure a series can be \"scaredy\" of super power, its much a matter of \"what can you do with the power of magic and the ability to stop people being able to do this\". We had so many great powers, the universe has so many stories, and everything that can be said about this series. Its a lot different today, but still one of the most interesting comic books I have finished...\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm going to hate this issue, but the plot of The Martian has me totally stunned. I read a few issues as to why people would be willing to live as if they were a human race, but with their mind being set in a world that they didn't know existed, and their brain being able to do that sort of thing, I have no idea what would have happened to their brains. I also don't understand why they weren't the first to realize where the world has come from. I have to wonder if this is some real work and effort to find how they have been able to survive this. I just want them to stop doing that stupid thing where they just keep going.\n\nI'm just as shocked that it didn't have the chance to include a third story arc. To me, this is probably one of the most intriguing things about this series -- I only just finished reading #40. It felt so much more plausible to me that way. (As an aside, I was actually watching the first volume of The Martian and immediately started thinking of a sequel.) The Martian made a surprising shift in tone, moving into some of its more philosophical areas of the series. My biggest complaint? It didn't write well as the first one, and I expected a much better story. It was less well of a story than the first one, it seems, because I thought it just kept getting stuck in my head, and I didn't get as much attention from the series in the same way which may be partly why I'm a little skeptical of it.\n\nThe Martian is the most likely answer to the second question in my opinion, and I'm very much looking forward to it. But it's a very strange piece of fiction at this level, and a shame that it's not an easy journey to follow or follow along. I'm a much bigger fan of the third story arc, which will also continue to see a side of the Martian people. With so much history going on here, there's an excellent chance they'll move that direction, and I'm hoping that the story can continue past the next issue.\n\nAs for the story itself, I haven't seen a lot of the plot as of yet, but the writing itself has some really cool twists. The ending was just a bit more dramatic than the first one, so that seemed to be the best way to end there. The new issue was just better than the usual issue, and the story was much more engaging. I have to say, I think this season was really good and the two-day issue was so good that I'm starting to think they are going to do another issue after this, and I am quite optimistic about what they were going to do and how well they were writing it.

{"id":3021,"ended":true,"length":719,"text":"The dusky dolphin, protected in much of its range, is listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN because ; ``... assessment of global population status is not possible with the currently available data.''\n\nAs of 2001, there were 1,861 specimens in the world\u00b4s oceans (the majority of them classified as ``very low-value'', the largest class of habitats in the world) and 1,841 of these, mostly protected species, were lost.\n\nFossil and marine specimens, which are considered very fragile, are very important for marine biology, but because they are not able to withstand significant water content, they are only as suitable for terrestrial science as for marine organisms like plankton.\n\nBut there are also certain problems:\n\nThe most famous case is not only the largest species of plankton - there are more than a hundred million species of plankton. Of these, 200 million have a low-viscosity range or lack water content and that is in most areas below 4C (90%).\n\nThe second most significant problem is that there is no information on the number of species that can survive, or how they could adapt to climate change and to global warming.\n\nConsequently, there have been only two studies that have proposed that the world\u00b4s planktonic forests could withstand a more than 20 degree change in water content and that the world\u00b4s oceans could at least tolerate a 100 degree change. To this end, marine biodiversity is of considerable importance.\n\nThe third most urgent issue of the moment, and which will ultimately become more important at the present time, is the climate-change danger. There is no need to worry about a warming of temperatures by the end of the century because the oceans will cool off more than once, even over a long period.\n\nThese problems are even more serious than before, when we were in the first half of the 20th century anticipating, but not forgetting, the catastrophic effect of the global increase in sea level.\n\nWhen a recent heatwave swept the oceans in December and November, there were fears that the global warming would be a prolonged period of record rainfall, as it was in June, with the ocean's surface to swells by more than two meters per second.\n\nAnd that is why scientists believe that the most serious threats to the ecosystem on either side of the world are the high levels of carbon dioxide and, because of climate change, water vapour.\n\nHowever, since then, a much bigger part of the world has been experiencing a prolonged heatwave and the threat to human life on the other side of the oceans has been heightened, making every opportunity available to the inhabitants.\n\nIf the world\u00b4s oceans are to absorb enough heat, the world\u00b4s seas should be able to absorb enough water and the world\u00b4s oceans are at least stable in terms of ocean resistance.\n\nIn the last several decades this has been the case and over the decades it is increasingly important that our oceans are resilient, and that those in coastal zones are able to cope. In particular, coastal islands are the ideal place for ocean species to adapt better to climate change than is possible in the coasts, and the Mediterranean will also be a valuable place for some of their marine species.\n\nIn order for our oceans to absorb enough heat, we need to be able to survive in a climate that is almost totally unaffected by climate change. Therefore, we need to do our lot in protecting our shores and the oceans from the environmental consequences of changes to rainfall.\n\nTherefore, we should also strengthen our understanding of climate change. We can adapt better to our environment, and learn from those in the coastlines of the west and east who are suffering from the effects of climate change already. Such practices help us to learn from the past and to understand who we should be

{"id":1502,"ended":true,"length":770,"text":"In 1968, Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick had imagined that by the year 2001, a machine would exist with an intelligence that matched or exceeded the capability of human beings. The new superintelligence, known as Neiblitz, will be much stronger than human being, and will have the capacity to destroy much of humanity. This machine will be much, much bigger than human existence. It will have a capacity of more than a million times greater than the number we today have. And it will be much, much stronger than humans.\n\nTo understand our current capabilities and to understand how to use this new machine, we need to understand what these machines do. For example, computers are the future of the human race. A machine that is capable of destroying and controlling a lot of humanity. With all those capabilities, they are not going to be able to destroy a vast scale of the population. And a machine capable of killing humans, that is far more powerful than human beings is going to do that. Instead of helping our world become a better place, we allow these machines to be able to destroy and control that population.\n\nThese machines can only do so much. And what they want to do, they can only do so much if the human being in question is not capable of making the choices that they should be making.\n\nWe really need more machines. More machines, more machines, more machine. Our human being is almost at max ability. We know that being a human being is extremely hard. We are almost able to use the capacity for many of the other qualities that humans have.\n\nYou see that human being could not do anything else than be a machine. And the man that makes that machine, could not do anything else. There are many other factors at work here. But first of all, most of this machine could have many more humanoids, and many more than we are currently able to put together. This machine could possibly, but not with the ability to do so much, could not be able to do so much. And that is where the technology comes in. The human being is so far beyond even the capacities that we currently have.\n\nSo as we go through this machine, it becomes clear that we need more machines. And for one reason or another, it needs to be able to do much more things than just do things. One of the ways to create more machines is at the level of human being. We need a machine that is capable of killing or defeating and manipulating humans. We need a machine that is in a state of greater capacity than the capacity or potential capacity of humans that is able to create for us today. Because, unlike every human being, the human being that is capable of destroying the human being, will not be able to create for us the machines that we need to create for humanity. This machine will be capable of doing as much as every human being can do. And we are now in the beginning phase of the journey that we are on, and we are almost halfway done.\n\nBut not yet there are still some of these machines that we do not need. Because the machine has many more humanoids to fight these machines. There is no reason to think that humans and machines will not create for us as technology gets closer.\n\nToday we know that in 10 or more years, humanity will be on the same continent. We know that in the end, we will be at another continent where the life of humanity will not end because the human being on the other continent might die.\n\nWe must do more on the level of human being, and we need to do more. We need to do more. Because human beings will create new species that we did not know existed. We must do more. And of course, we already have the technology. But at this point, we know that we are far too late to take this

{"id":2839,"ended":true,"length":650,"text":"The Qing emperor used shamanism to promote the dynasty's legitimacy among the Tungusic peoples \u2014 such as the < unk >, < unk >, and < unk > \u2014 who lived near the city center, the \"kingdom of the Tungusic peoples.\"\n\nAccording to a tradition known as Hanseatic Buddhism, these \"kingdoms\": Han, the king, and the \"kingdom of the Tungusic people\" are the most powerful and influential cultures on the planet; their cultures, however, did nothing to preserve their ancient values.\n\nThe Xing dynasty, on the other hand, was a significant one for Tungusic culture. In the Han Dynasty, the Tungusic clan dominated the empire, and in the imperial years of the Xing dynasty, nearly twice as many Ting dynasty members were as powerful as the Chinese royal family.\n\nWhat did a Tungusic culture have to do with the Qing dynasty? A Tungusic culture is a group or community of strong, intelligent people who have no formal training. They also have no formal training that should have a long history.\n\nTungusic culture included Buddhism, Hindu and Asian culture, and Christianity and Islam. Thus, in China, the culture of the Tungusic peoples is very close to Buddhism and Hinduism. Buddhist and Hinduism are considered to be more conservative and modern cultural traditions, although the Tibetan Buddhist traditions are more Christian. To this end, the Tungusic culture has a rich Asian-style cultural tradition of the Han Dynasty.\n\nTungusic culture also includes both Christianity-style Buddhism (such as Muhyiddin) and Hinduism. According to Hui, a scholar and translator, the Tungusic culture has a high cultural tradition. The Tungusic culture can be described as a kind of \"Tungusic culture.\"\n\nFurthermore, Tungusic culture is particularly related to Buddhist teachings. According to the Han Dynasty, the Tungusic culture has been practised in Tungu, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Xinjiang in the Qing dynasty which was dominated by Buddhist Buddhism.\n\nThe development of Buddhism in the Qing regime is the most likely source of the Tungusic culture, and the development of the Han dynasty is the main source of Tungusic culture.\n\nDuring the Qing era, Tungusic culture experienced many significant developments. In the Tungusic culture, Buddhism, Hinduism in the Qing era, and Islam were major features. As a result, the Chinese communist Party adopted various progressive and revolutionary policies. In the Tungusic culture, various reforms were carried out. The Chinese Communist Party adopted various measures in the Qing era, such as the establishment of the China National Research Center (CCR), which was an important cultural center for Tungusic culture. Additionally, the anti-Japanese policy of the Qing Dynasty and the Chinese national defense policies of the Qing Dynasty were greatly improved.\n\nThe new Han administration has made a considerable contribution to Tungusic culture and is widely regarded as the great architect of the Qing dynasty.\n\nAs stated previously, the development of Buddhism in the Qing regime is the most likely source of the Tungusic culture, and the development of the Han dynasty is the main source of Tungusic culture.\n\nIn other words, the development of Buddhism and Hinduism in the Qing regime is the primary source of the Tungusic culture.\n\nTherefore, Tungusic\n\nculture of China is most likely to emerge as a prominent influence in Chinese culture and in the Chinese leadership. Therefore, it is important to note that the development of Tungusic culture in China is one of the great architectural developments of the world.","token_len":792,"entropy":[12.4638,5.2934,4.654,11.36,0.5776,0.5564,6.2314,1.9003,7.91,2.1635,6.271,4.7369,0.6313,7.4222,3.2975,3.1639,6.494,1.2304,6.2053,5.6496,0.2425,0.79,12.0945,10.9459,6.479,4.963,4.1184,1.3906,2.8351,0.7984,0.5526,0.5422,0.6876,0.3102,1.2067,0.1118,0.1767,1.9761,3.8229,4.2146,4.5879,0.4398,4.3338,3.9532,2.1904,3.0433,4.6891,5.5477,0.9712,0.7718,0.7588,2.5978,0.0365,0.0457,0.4714,1.3977,0.7626,1.5869,0.0013,4.9838,0.0059,2.8729,4.7976,5.0932,0.15,6.0887,5.8247,1.4037,3.56,0.2286,4.4705,3.7979,1.7557,0.1686,8.5424,4.7488,3.3241,2.5431,3.7597,1.4455,1.8321,1.1776,3.8036,0.9217,0.2783,0.2263,0.138,0.484,0.0017,0.0035,0.0958,3.4385,1.2303,1.693,2.2815,3.6331,2.7654,2.0148,1.7796,5.8043,2.5549,1.3705,0.6072,4.5559,2.7173,5.1162,3.6213,2.3317,0.0145,4.8576,7.831,0.4722,4.5385,1.3113,3.5163,6.455,0.7989,1.1527,0.0002,1.8991,7.5659,2.3076,1.8579,1.6388,3.2099,0.0144,0.0165,0.0019,0.0074,1.9018,1.8292,4.403,4.8088,2.9338,4.7645,0.1172,0.0209,0.0942,2.1945,0.8196,2.627,1.4246,4.6151,2.8013,0.2664,1.0445,2.3987,0.0074,0.0172,0.0852,6.1366,5.245,0.8416,4.5309,1.4956,1.6215,3.2733,1.1962,5.7284,3.7061,2.4528,0.5846,2.9635,0.0086,0.6476,0.3678,5.9692,7.2868,0.2848,0.0691,1.6436,7.0372,4.7968,1.524,0.9748,5.0219,2.6163,0.2595,0.8016,4.2063,5.0591,0.1937,0.3726,0.935,0.0002,5.1333,3.2345,5.141,2.2099,0.0979,0.0311,0.0195,2.4111,1.6871,0.1677,1.1546,0.0027,1.3028,2.0911,1.9158,0.2766,4.4621,2.5347,0.0139,0.0139,0.0202,0.9963,2.7658,1.5411,3.1001,5.3026,3.4253,1.0712,7.6317,1.7381,4.326,1.3156,0.8244,2.3381,4.2568,3.6274,3.5893,2.6097,1.8937,4.8352,1.0194,0.9847,0.9369,1.8564,5.2542,5.7928,3.5328,3.7224,5.6186,1.7417,1.0949,1.5692,0.0002,2.5044,0.0931,0.0149,0.1002,1.1387,6.7817,6.1024,0.3009,3.2918,6.6524,6.3645,2.8204,0.39,1.1413,4.8974,1.6297,1.7006,0.3114,5.5481,0.1927,3.7105,3.6371,0.4501,1.6344,4.3297,0.6267,0.8405,1.0566,0.0048,0.0052,0.0535,1.087,2.4795,3.173,3.4396,0.0661,3.4349,1.0704,1.1232,1.0754,0.5144,6.3539,1.2452,0.271,2.0575,1.1916,3.1293,1.216,0.1893,3.505,5.9461,1.5479,5.3667,6.754,1.9099,1.9495,3.8717,2.2668,5.1494,2.6611,3.0931,0.9141,1.8333,6.1676,1.02,6.3925,3.0916,1.2523,0.0248,1.2972,0.9619,0.0029,0.0096,0.0956,1.5337,2.3622,1.8949,4.4442,7.7044,3.3448,3.2492,4.7063,1.079,4.1243,3.27,3.6405,2.06,0.9098,0.3775,0.0002,2.3866,0.1523,0.0099,0.0849,1.0536,2.3705,1.6402,4.9537,3.4472,7.6853,3.2981,3.1894,3.4591,4.1954,0.004,6.6135,4.0912,1.9148,3.2592,0.208,1.9957,0.05,2.0414,0.553,2.0925,4.5896,0.0017,5.4184,2.2909,2.2968,3.2562,3.6,3.2084,4.4307,2.4673,1.2748,1.0656,0.0022,0.0061,0.0651,0.7974,2.5466,1.424,4.1077,4.6282,3.4421,4.2483,2.7426,1.041,0.0032,0.0102,0.0338,0.7266,5.4824,0.7677,3.1591,0.2295,1.1915,4.1643,0.0027,1.8406,4.8887,0.5282,0.2793,0.0881,2.0055,1.7441,0.8515,0.0002,6.2162,0.0039,2.3363,0.011,0.0074,0.0714,0.5143,1.372,6.112,4.9593,0.0346,4.472,4.5155,1.2651,1.7905,0.0014,2.7176,3.2256,1.5033,0.9211,1.0282,0.7996,0.0018,0.0063,0.0287,1.4429,3.1602,2.0866,5.6821,0.0525,1.5077,4.3527,0.1467,3.6021,1.7194,4.5333,0.0819,0.3541,4.5295,0.1125,0.0264,0.2657,1.039,2.8511,0.0113,3.5447,1.3096,3.0965,1.427,7.8426,2.7688,4.6499,0.0364,4.6642,4.5625,0.5965,1.0465,0.0002,1.8311,7.1963,0.044,1.6375,0.9065,1.3473,1.4767,6.4371,2.759,4.0322,2.4535,5.4273,2.5167,0.0848,0.6483,0.9502,0.0023,0.0071,0.009,0.4867,2.7036,2.2098,1.7066,4.1171,0.0331,2.1428,3.0915,1.9424,0.957,1.1884,3.7498,0.8571,0.1809,3.255,0.0048,0.0227,0.0035,0.1017,0.3231,0.8225,0.0002,5.1749,0.1336,0.7808,2.1166,0.1033,1.9354,0.0174,0.0509,0.1059,0.5043,5.5761,3.7966,4.5901,3.8092,0.7338,2.5402,0.6476,3.8035,0.0206,0.1719,0.0224,2.93,0.4267,3.3676,3.0797,0.6495,0.0974,8.5276,2.2507,1.62,2.4251,0.1524,0.375,2.2996,2.0511,5.3782,5.3323,1.3088,4.2604,1.0396,0.2158,0.1658,0.9394,3.0251,7.733,4.0287,4.2613,5.2919,6.48,2.685,4.9637,1.6847,1.7169,2.6873,1.0481,2.3107,0.0018,0.0093,0.0121,0.1612,0.0715,6.4032,4.6523,0.6376,2.9383,0.0462,1.9409,2.4688,2.29,0.6988,0.0491,3.3053,2.3614,4.2809,3.5004,1.0486,3.3568,1.0331,1.5728,1.7443,0.0025,1.2183,2.4325,0.0081,1.5693,5.9562,2.443,5.2861,1.4232,1.3789,2.3865,0.5409,0.5266,2.0066,1.4367,4.3916,1.3863,6.0579,1.195,1.2467,1.7015,0.0077,0.0111,0.1491,0.6145,0.7045,5.8669,0.0062,0.6578,7.303,0.0094,3.563,3.3181,0.8281,0.2218,1.4425,2.294,3.1548,0.5845,2.8611,5.5925,4.1979,3.525,0.6258,0.2588,0.6934,1.1199,1.1065,6.0349,3.7703,0.392,0.5731,0.0002,1.6332,6.2807,4.573,5.5511,3.6055,3.6148,2.7932,4.2303,2.3653,0.2941,1.3264,0.002,0.0101,0.0062,0.0649,2.4997,2.9199,5.0137,1.567,0.095,0.989,4.9036,4.3311,0.0892,0.7479,2.3219,0.779,0.1855,1.4367,0.0002,4.1089,5.7039,2.833,0.0656,0.8514,4.9113,0.0267,0.5658,0.386,0.2375,0.5061,1.8517,0.5981,0.073,0.1743,0.0042,0.0078,0.0013,0.011,0.0611,0.0024,0.0012,0.0038,0.0114,0.1318,0.0484,0.0098,0.1175,0.001,0.0164,0.0104,0.0286,0.0044,0.0055,0.0112,0.002,0.0013,0.1618,0.0061,0.0031,0.0027,0.002,0.0396,0.5479,0.0002,2.932,3.9193,0.1079,0.0121,0.8206,2.029,0.0196,0.4678,3.249,1.0197,0.0089,0.9459,0.2791,0.5421,1.1081,0.4123,0.2654,4.1518,0.35

{"id":1101,"ended":true,"length":762,"text":"At the start of May Tristan finished unplaced behind Peregrine in the 2000 Guineas and two weeks later he ran third in the Payne Stakes. In the Derby he ran prominently for much of the day \u2013 on the line between the first four runners he went for three and half miles, the third mile up, and fourth mile down.\nIt was on the fifth, fifth, sixth and seventh runs that Tristan started to see more of a reaction; he lost his balance and lost the balance to lose the ball, then lost his balance again to lose the ball.\nThis happened during a race where he and five of his four horses had one runner finished behind him in two.\nAs a result of this, the Derby winner was disqualified that time.\nThe final track was a relatively flat one on the wet side. After the track was finished Tristan was back to a very good form. He was second a mile and a half later when we ran off the mark in the final mile.\nIt felt like a big deal, though, that there would have been more than one winner. I would say he was one of the favourites in that race because of what happened in the Derby final \u2013 he had to work so hard to get up and down the track, as well as to make the start of that race.\nAnd that was just what we saw. He was strong in that race. Then we tried to hit the final track and the race ended in third place. It's a fantastic race to visit after a few hundred miles of racing this race.\nWhat is Tristan's latest training plan?\nHe has been training really hard for the Derby, getting a good deal of work into the weekend as well. He has been doing the preparation, and getting his training in.\nThen this year he got into some shape too, and made many steps forward. He is just a big, strong horse. He is good at getting up and down the track, but also going up and down the track.\nHow is it for you now to have a trainer again?\nTo be honest, when my wife is with me, we get along very well. We got married. We are still trying to get to a little bit of romance, but what's great is that she will tell us all the times that we have been in love, and things she will say when she is getting married. That way she can always be there.\nWhen are you going back to London to train again?\nIt is not too far away any time soon, I just am a little bit more relaxed, so I will train in my own way, getting away as much as I can and then making every opportunity available to me.\nHave you made the decision to return?\nYes, I have. I have a friend in London who wants to go back now and the other man in the United States as well, but I have a lot of good motivation and he is interested.\nHave you got any new memories from racing this year?\nI did not go racing this year, there are a couple of things. At the start of the season, the race was really tight, and the final race was much tighter than ever.\nI would have liked to have had that final race as a result, but it wasn't to be today. I had a huge, good start, but not the quality I was feeling. I would like to think I didn't miss anything in that race. It was well taken care of.\nDo you have any thoughts about returning to training in the future?\nI would have liked to have had it. I know I have had a great summer running our race this year, and I am looking forward to it every day and looking out for it all the next couple of months. I know it seems a long way off, but there is always hope.","token_len":792,"entropy":[2.5476,4.1163,0.1805,5.0799,10.9777,2.7563,7.2911,8.7783,9.0834,5.1272,11.9587,2.6174,0.0345,3.5172,0.5472,9.8236,10.4626,1.9256,2.2766,4.6074,6.4338,3.2638,0.2135,1.7836,5.7837,2.7462,1.0158,0.4619,13.2849,6.563,1.3956,0.8863,2.88,1.8663,8.7442,1.4771,3.2585,11.6671,2.9751,7.5162,0.0409,0.261,4.9943,5.0989,4.4873,1.187,5.164,5.185,1.7565,4.313,4.5412,5.0346,4.0827,4.4471,2.9054,3.8746,2.0502,6.6074,2.4811,2.1563,3.2864,2.4864,4.3297,5.4285,1.76,1.1795,6.0439,1.5755,0.9389,0.4962,1.5156,10.7026,0.5615,3.66,1.1672,3.5458,3.3475,4.2568,0.6373,0.6398,1.0057,0.2592,3.8454,0.8696,1.274,0.0002,3.8258,0.8718,4.3194,3.7626,1.7686,2.0303,6.0407,5.8294,1.2117,6.4757,1.8552,2.6013,0.8603,3.7132,2.7635,3.1478,5.3673,9.3877,1.5174,3.6772,2.4508,3.5802,3.0964,1.9514,0.8645,0.3625,2.3985,0.8893,0.2199,0.218,1.5147,1.8289,4.022,3.9671,4.6893,1.6306,3.3796,2.1831,1.0167,5.6556,6.8511,2.1596,0.1369,4.1829,5.9911,2.0705,6.1796,7.1036,7.4147,4.2326,0.7513,2.3581,5.198,3.5291,2.132,4.3307,2.6282,0.3931,1.1597,0.8577,1.5221,2.249,4.2239,3.6816,1.7578,3.9441,7.3551,6.0735,1.0923,0.9965,2.3611,3.3754,6.7227,2.0671,2.9212,5.5605,2.9666,1.8802,4.0294,0.6814,7.1739,2.5422,2.015,4.5984,1.8472,5.222,1.1594,3.3157,1.6963,0.0002,2.5392,4.5145,2.699,4.3367,4.1476,2.6625,2.4012,1.3495,1.1794,1.9778,4.2353,6.9911,4.4189,2.9301,0.4439,0.0223,3.1232,4.0291,5.9878,3.4779,4.47,1.385,6.4008,2.8208,0.8056,3.0325,3.44,0.8125,0.5667,3.4509,5.6392,0.9082,1.3641,4.1169,4.5754,2.6219,4.5961,1.1439,2.4748,4.3682,2.4742,4.3253,0.2963,3.469,2.8162,0.565,1.8834,1.746,3.6623,3.9909,2.8723,3.2623,1.2322,3.7865,0.4418,0.4625,3.0408,3.5538,2.0708,1.0872,3.7007,2.0376,3.5591,1.5199,1.6869,0.6251,3.6143,4.5203,3.7678,1.1825,1.8223,3.1659,4.9572,3.6351,0.0575,0.6047,1.4685,3.074,2.3718,2.004,0.9273,1.3176,2.1719,4.5615,1.633,0.0164,1.808,3.4564,1.8622,5.5396,2.7243,5.3029,1.0915,0.9911,0.537,4.5676,2.5959,0.9889,3.8061,2.5038,3.062,3.0005,1.2444,2.8304,1.5721,5.733,2.3299,2.1724,1.283,1.6608,5.6248,2.3341,6.2918,0.4108,5.4545,1.8568,4.5868,3.8011,2.2854,3.532,3.1318,1.7142,1.3651,5.5986,1.5489,0.4397,3.1113,3.2949,1.7176,4.4715,2.6245,3.5326,7.3799,5.9353,1.8792,4.4845,4.353,0.6348,1.7858,0.8693,6.8944,4.0284,0.6743,0.4582,4.378,3.1129,5.806,0.0004,0.6289,5.9373,4.5657,2.6196,0.3727,0.2348,2.1372,1.551,1.5298,1.0892,4.877,0.4323,1.7012,0.9038,6.5392,2.7622,4.8027,3.2866,2.3209,5.2648,0.2273,3.7362,4.9557,1.1011,4.1443,4.5633,0.6066,2.2143,1.1914,1.2667,1.046,2.0687,3.2265,6.7411,2.8441,2.6508,3.673,2.5998,3.6979,2.0407,2.2104,1.1978,6.0091,3.8495,3.4253,0.9757,3.3039,2.9391,3.4448,6.1587,5.0836,1.3942,2.028,5.4231,6.4111,5.41,1.3733,1.163,1.2885,2.1178,4.6755,2.6667,4.5114,2.5762,0.7292,2.1028,1.481,1.0442,1.242,5.2569,1.1865,2.7808,1.5361,0.8147,0.118,0.7333,0.25,1.1993,2.1496,2.5214,4.9015,1.9737,0.3507,0.0504,0.8274,1.3004,1.4636,1.0844,4.1052,2.5603,2.3352,3.8645,1.4579,4.3687,1.6838,4.232,1.5803,5.1424,8.257,0.5156,0.1945,5.6894,1.1589,0.7019,0.7718,4.361,4.8024,3.0789,4.1538,2.8676,0.147,0.9583,2.457,3.7189,2.0128,1.5938,0.0412,0.5654,1.6222,5.4095,2.0492,5.253,1.2108,2.3958,3.1107,4.895,0.0597,1.0775,2.7435,2.2144,4.9098,0.5686,0.2532,8.0804,1.5048,0.7188,5.5183,2.7799,3.3465,1.0276,0.5154,2.4666,4.3647,4.8838,1.8566,3.2568,1.6648,3.5194,1.7979,1.5324,1.7535,1.4118,3.1389,1.2635,1.6395,0.8791,5.1838,5.5795,3.9354,1.8514,3.5661,1.3105,1.1383,4.3496,2.2755,0.5046,3.5517,4.4966,1.7448,1.2541,3.7889,2.301,1.3497,2.568,0.4493,3.678,6.2381,0.2011,0.7601,3.5421,0.3572,5.3031,2.2718,1.5105,0.7304,0.1192,0.1162,2.5698,1.4617,2.8627,3.2411,1.9755,0.5168,8.7806,0.6607,0.0667,1.4647,3.4443,4.0071,5.2892,4.677,0.8312,0.2998,2.5968,2.0368,2.7691,2.6421,0.8862,1.59,4.5542,2.7967,3.8158,2.0336,2.8557,2.6592,6.3087,4.9318,5.3052,0.7069,0.0343,0.6263,0.1018,3.5528,2.3684,5.4176,7.055,6.2196,2.671,0.945,2.6104,0.411,0.486,3.9796,0.1002,4.5791,3.5834,1.7046,0.2045,2.4027,4.0554,0.132,1.8632,0.5332,0.9522,1.065,0.8119,1.02,1.4309,3.2118,4.0489,2.8168,1.8157,0.7858,4.8254,0.2711,3.1346,0.8711,5.5347,2.2732,5.4065,3.9144,6.1604,2.5776,1.3817,5.3487,0.9683,6.4786,0.0361,1.4707,1.9469,0.999,1.7502,3.1352,2.6651,0.5704,4.636,7.7281,2.4845,4.9711,1.0568,3.7974,2.0836,1.0498,3.5781,0.0726,2.7499,0.9425,3.9244,6.8297,2.0854,3.3614,2.7793,0.9343,0.0661,0.0697,1.0858,3.8281,1.47,3.6673,2.8556,2.6904,0.0908,1.1541,5.8821,2.3219,1.86,2.4099,0.1845,1.5085,3.335,6.2601,0.6947,1.5429,0.591,0.6537,1.142,1.8859,3.4013,2.8131,0.7104,3.3027,4.4184,1.2769,1.6043,2.7949,5.0161,2.9745,0.5858,4.4945,3.0349,1.3101,5.2538,0.6965,1.7312,1.6067,3.9868,2.4605,0.9422,0.1502,1.0386,2.0975,4.7071,3.2428,0.4387,3.3162,1.9332,3.5584,0.8741,0.2913,1.9594,2.8407,0.0004,4.0487,0.6291,8.3237,0.5847,1.303,2.3687,1.38,5.2396,4.8572,4.3304,3.2015,1.4152,1.3323,4.9075,3.3142,6.0614,1.1989,1.9504,4.6567,1.4446,1.2965,3.2203,2.1814,0.086,3.9432,1.5215,5.8036,0.0003,5.4971,2.8477,2.9376,2.0471,0.5067,0.896,3.0143,0.7283,6.4692,6.0504,0.3136,0.0146,1.2858,0.4887,3.2614,0.0238,1.4235,0.3

{"id":148,"ended":false,"length":687,"text":"On 12 June 2006, with his contract expired, Stansfield decided to remain in the Conference, joining Exeter City. He told local radio that his aim was not to achieve promotion or even have a playoff place, but to progress. Stansfield stated that he \"thought that the players were happy, that the club made a commitment, that there would be another chance to win their league\", and that there did not see any doubt of him achieving what he wanted. The same weekend, he announced that he would stay in the competition, signing a one-year contract with the club, however, because of the financial implications, he had not signed any new contract. Stansfield also told Stansfield that he was \"sorry about that but there will be another chance. I know that as a player I just will have to be honest to be honest\".\n\nAfter a disappointing season in English football, Stansfield suffered relegation in the final of the Division I Premier Championship in the 2003\/04 season. After scoring 17 goals in a league which would have been more than enough for a cup qualification place, Stansfield wanted to go back to work for a job in Germany. He wanted to win and to succeed in his job and he always sought work in Germany without ever knowing how much money he could earn.\n\nDespite numerous setbacks in his career, Stansfield still managed to make it out of the first team. Due to the lack of goals he scored in 2006, and the fact that he was unable to get a starting spot in the First XI, Stansfield remained in the league which he needed to make it to the last-16 stages of a Cup. At the end of the season, in order to get closer to the goalkeeping qualification, Stansfield went off to Germany with a goal in the first tie between the two teams. The next match left Stansfield with a poor record against Frankfurt, he lost the tie 3\u20132 against the third-place team of Hoffenheim, and at the end of the season, it was concluded that he did not progress in any way into the competition, as he was not given a starting spot in the first team as they were playing in a 3\u20130 defeat to Manchester City, while his future could be uncertain at the moment.\n\nAfter losing 1\u20131 at home to Manchester City on 23 February 2007, Stansfield joined Mainz at the start of 2008, but finished the current campaign with an indifferent season. He made 28 appearances after joining Mainz and scored a goal in a 3\u20131 home win against Stuttgart in the German Cup on 11 October 2008. In the league, he scored six more times, the last against Bremen on 15 December 2008, the most recent against Hoffenheim on 3 March 2009. In the semi-finals at the start of the season, he scored in an away match against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. On 7 October 2009, he scored two goals and had one assist in a 1\u20130 win against Gelsenkirchen.\n\nAfter completing a season-long loan spell from the Swiss side Neues F\u00f6rder (then known as Mainz F\u00f6rder L\u00e4nder) in October 2008, Stansfield was released after a series of injuries to his body.

{"id":863,"ended":true,"length":738,"text":"`` Rockstar 101 `` received mixed responses from music critics. Brian Linder for IGN praised the song, writing that it `` actually works `` despite sounding disjointed at first. Emily Tartanella of Electronic Music Review, who praised the song as '' very original '' and said that \"The song has a pretty deep, very good rhythm, and that makes it seem quite out of the ordinary '' as well \"As an opening track (which is true of every song recorded so far), we must keep in mind that the song is composed by Paul Smith, the founder and chief operating officer of the band's British rock label and the vocalist of the band's \"rock-infinite'' album.\n\nRockstar said it had never heard of the song but had heard it on a band's recording studio as early as 1969. The first demo for the song was at the hands of a local artist, the English singer Michael Piazzetta, who later recorded more than 90 songs in his own time.\n\nIn an interview in 2002, Rockstar revealed its conception, noting that he had wanted the song to be known as '' Rockstar 101'' and that he wanted it to have some significance to the band. The song became Rockstar 101 and was later used by British pop music artists like Michael Jackson.\n\nA song that Rolling Stone ranked as Rockstar 101 was ''In A Room With 2 Girls'' by [[The Internet Music Encyclopedia]], the album's lead single.\n\nThe group's version of the song was recorded at a studio in West Brighton, Conn., on the band's second album, which peaked at No. 2 on both Billboard's 100 and SoundClouds.\n\nThough the song has been in the spotlight for many years, Rockstar's reputation was hurt after the band left the band in 1980 for a tour in Europe, following a series of unanticipated, unreleased tracks.\n\nAt the time, the group said that they were focusing on the new music they would release with Paul Smith, who had been promoted to senior director of music management.\n\n\"We're very proud to announce that Paul has left the band and that we're bringing Rockstar 101 to life on a European tour, with the purpose of capturing the sound of the era.\"\n\nThe group would later release new rock and metal music in Europe, the United States and Australia. Rockstar's original rock and metal album appeared at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 in 1985--the first time an album was made on its first release date.\n\nRockstar in a previous interview in 2002 also referred to the album as '' Rockstar 101'' and said that he wanted to ''make it as an album which sounds like music that's made by music people.'' The song was \"an interesting choice,'' and he added it was \"a very good one.''\n\nOn a 2010 interview, Rockstar said that his second album ''Rockstar'' featured the band's original ideas and that the album he's written and released is his \"best album of all time.\" The band's previous album ''Stereo'' has been listed at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 every week, and the recent rock album ''Rockstar'' has been listed at No. 25 on the Billboard 200 every week.\n\nRockstar said that his second album was his first in over 10 years, with the release of ''Rockstar 101'' in 1999. The band said that they wanted to record the album as high-quality music and the band didn't want the fans to get confused about \"rock and metal,\" because it would have been about \"rock versus

{"id":4043,"ended":false,"length":703,"text":"The 411th Engineer Brigade traces its lineage back to the 355th Engineer Regiment, which was first constituted on 15 October 1921 in the Organized Reserves. The regiment was organized in January 1922 with the aim of forming the next regiment, the 355th Engineer Brigade (Arms and Farms) to assist the British army against the Indian Army (17 May-7 December, 1914).\n\nIn the First World War, the regiment was stationed in the Falklands Islands, supporting both the British and American troops. In May 1917, the regiment moved to St Austell. It came into service with the help of the 6th Infantry Division on 3 September 1918. On 5 October 1918, it was reconstituted by the 5th Brigade to support soldiers in the Persian Gulf and the Pacific Ocean. The unit stayed at St Austell for its first two months at the Camp Cuthbert House, Cumbria. On 28 March 1919, it joined the 488th Engineer Regiment, which is still operating and is known as the 330th Engineer Brigade (Arms and Farms).\n\nThe regiment was promoted to the rank of sergeant with the exception of its ranks, or cadets. On 9 February 1922, it became detached to the 1st Brigade, with its command posted at Bury St Edmund\u2019s. The unit went into action in France in February 1927 under Captain David J. Cook, and in March it moved to San Francisco. In March 1927, it was regained and its rank was demoted to sergeant with the exception of its ranks, or cadets.\n\nOn 9 March 1927, it received the first attack at San Francisco (from the 500s M4S guns aboard the USS California). In the following months the unit worked with the 2nd Brigade, where it was engaged in several high-risk operations in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, Japan, the South China Sea, and East Java. On 10 September 1927, the unit was transferred to the 3rd Brigade, of which the unit was the first to be stationed in East Java. On 15 November, it was transferred to the 2d Brigade, of which the unit was the 10th. The unit was based out of Croydon, South Wales during the Second World War, and is still based out of Walsall, North Yorkshire.\n\nThe 333d Engineer Brigade was an important unit in the Second World War with its combat operations at various locations in Europe, including the Battle of the Sea, which was an arms-and-armour operations against the Japanese on 13 March 1914. On 22 December, it was detached to the second-in-command, the 330th Engineer Brigade (Arms and Farms), which was stationed in the Cretan Gulf. The regiment was equipped for its fighting in the Persian Gulf, the Pacific Ocean, the Indus River, and the Mediterranean.\n\nThe 3d Brigade was one of the first unit to engage in an engagement against Japanese forces in a major war zone and it was also a key combat unit in the East Asia War of 1946\u201349.\n\nThe 350th Engineer Brigade was attached to the 3d Corps (or unit of the 2nd Corps) and was primarily responsible for its activities during the Battle of the Great Depression. From August 1944 to December 1945, it participated in the Battle of the Pearl River (to protect the city of New Jersey). During that period and in the midst of the war, the unit served as a counter-submarine combat force.

{"id":3026,"ended":true,"length":712,"text":"Bellaire currently has a city manager style of government. The home rule government was established on April 2, 1949, replacing the general law form of government. The city council is made up of 17 members elected by the public. They work in a set system of \"house-keeping\", the process usually begins while a resident is off sick or sick out of the house. Some people may be affected by this system of housekeeping. One of the most significant changes we see in the city is the introduction of public transportation, which is the very thing that has become synonymous with Bellaire, despite the fact that it is one of the poorest towns in the nation. Bellaire offers only private rides for residents and the public transportation is the only way to transportation in certain parts. Bellaire offers a few very affordable bus trips.\n\nSince you live in Bellaire, you might find yourself in need of some help during busy season. Bellaire has more than 7,500 restaurants in the city, and that is in addition to many of the rest of the community food banks. That said, I would recommend visiting Bellaire City Hall with your fellow residents because there are a number of educational institutions open throughout town and there are some excellent programs and services available. Bellaire City Hall offers several hours of town hours from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. When you enter City Hall, you can call or use the phone at (508) 421-3811 and ask for a meeting time of your choice. There are also special events for business travelers such as the Bellaire Chamber of Commerce annual banquet on Saturday, and free lunch Sunday, October 18, and the Bellaire Chamber Chamber of Commerce annual business fair on Sunday, October 19. There are also local businesses where you can purchase food items either for yourself or for your family. If you are looking for the perfect place to eat in Bellaire, Bellaire can be found. Bellaire is known as an area with a growing number of restaurants, and it is home to a large number of popular restaurants.\n\nBellaire is also known for their food. It is quite convenient because of their fast-food restaurants, as well as the nearby Walnut Lake Lake. Bellaire's restaurants are often small, so you may be able to eat at one fast-food restaurant within the few hours you get from the airport. Bellaire serves hot chocolate all at just 6 cents a cup, while the nearby Walnut Lake Lake is an hour and a half after Bellaire closes.\n\nThe Bellaire City Council can be seen on YouTube or via Facebook at facebook.com\/lindbrookleychamber and Twitter at twitter.com\/lindbrookleychamber or on the city website at facebook.com\/lindbrookleychamber.\n\nBe sure to share this article with friends!\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is general in nature and may result in an error.

{"id":1636,"ended":false,"length":750,"text":"A kitsune may take on human form, an ability learned when it reaches a certain age \u2014 usually 100 years, although some tales say 50. As a common prerequisite for the transformation, the kitune is a kind of \"body.\"\nThe basic kitune \"is, as a species, an essential characteristic of a human being.\" It can be found in the world's first kitune specimen (a Kitune II), which is the only specimen available online for science.\n\"The basic kitune, if it were to evolve from human body [the kitune will be] a creature of the body of every creature,\" said James A. Roper, a Ph.D. student in evolution and the author of \"The Body of The Kid\" and \"Nature's Greatest Story.\" \"Whether as a matter of evolution or as a biological activity, the kitune \u2014 known as the body \u2014 is a biological part of the nature.\"\nCute kitsune\n\"It is more human-like than in most species, though a bit more humanoid, due to its increased size, size and weight,\" Arieff says. \"The kitune is, as such, an integral part of the human species.\"\nFor example, he attributes the human body as a complete animal; the kitune resembles the creature the biologist uses for her \"bio\" models. A similar type of kitune is found in the animals of the plant species \"Aquiline\" (originally described as a \"species of plant,\" according to the British Biologics Society of America).\nIt is \"a natural feature,\" Roper said, that the kitune \"is the most important characteristic of the human body.\"\n\"There are many reasons to believe that the kitune may be the human body,\" he said. \"The first being that it is so many years older than the body of a plant. If the body had been longer than 100 years old, the 'kitune' would definitely be of more importance for the purpose.\"\nScientists believe that a kitune has a \"natural\" effect upon a human being. It is similar to the phenomenon that scientists call the \"body of the infant.\"\n\"We are not looking for any 'natural' features of the 'baby,' but we would like to see an increase in the body's density,\" Roper said.\nThe kitune can be used as part of a natural process, such as changing the color and size of the hair or fur or giving off energy after eating a food or drink. It is a \"natural\" component of the biology or behavior of a natural process, such as creating a food or drink, or making a food, which the body generates in response to the natural gas that is produced during the transfer from the mouth to the ear, Arieff said.\nIn response to this, the kitune's body receives a set of stimuli \u2014 the signal that it needs to get rid of the waste and waste and waste from the body and \"make up for lost time.\"\nRoper says there are a variety of ways to create kitsune. He has discovered the use of many methods, including the use of bacteria, mice and plants \u2014 but he says there is no way to create a kitune \"only after all that is made of the body.\"\n\"For example, you could use plants, or you could make eggs, or you could make a mixture or make a milk.\"\nRoper added that there are also ways to create kitsune.

{"id":4749,"ended":true,"length":748,"text":"Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan ; having spent most of the season profiting from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was the victim of an 'adventure.' As he turned 25 on Thursday he was given a life sentence, the first such punishment by the governing body of the planet after an accident in Japan. As the world's longest-serving racing driver now turns 35 on Sunday he is the next day on the world's biggest track. And Alonso says his luck finally ran out in Japan in Sunday's round.\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Alonso is now only one of the nine drivers from Mexico to win the Honda MotoGP championship in Japan because his championship is in danger. With Alonso not only already tied for first place in his previous race, but third in MotoGP with nine titles won by Spaniard Marco Marquez, he said his luck finally runs out in Japan. \"If I can do that, it will be really special, all hands on deck. I also want to try to repeat my winning times in my next race and I know that I have good motivation, everything and I have a real goal and I'm working toward that goal,\" Alonso said.\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content \"It's going to be a challenge, but at the same time it's very exciting being a teammate... I want to go again and it's just really special.\" During his nine championship appearances in Mexico, Alonso has won 16 titles at home, and last season he was runner-up in the championship standings. The 24-year-old Spaniard now looks like the winner of this season's championship with eight title wins, two overtaking victories and 11 top-10 finishes. Alonso is unbeaten in his career at Red Bull as well, with each of his seven championships coming after he failed to finish in the top 16 on two occasions this season. The Spaniard finished second last season behind Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz in the standings.\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Alonso's last race in Mexico took place on January 1 against the Spanish Grand Prix in which he finished 1.1 seconds behind Sainz and Carlos Sainz. Sainz took a stunning penalty from Fernando Alonso, but Alonso eventually won the race, which Alonso won with 17 laps remaining after both cars broke down, forcing him in a crash that resulted in his team getting hit by a second car on the finish line. Alonso had to wait several seconds before the incident happened, only to have that moment ruined by the Spanish incident that happened on Sunday. While the Spaniard was happy it was his last race on the world's top circuit, he was also extremely disappointed with how his season went about the day. \"A good weekend for us, but unfortunately a good one for us, you can't blame it,\" Alonso said. \"I can't blame the team, because we had a crash. I was feeling the pain and there were a lot of situations going on, but I did manage to recover well and the two-day practice before the crash was cancelled.\"\nShare this article in your social network\nLatest National Stories Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nDaily Wall St. Headlines Sign up to receive daily news alerts from North America's Bay Area and across the Bay Area and support the region's highest-ranked journalism by subscribing to our Headlines email newsletter.

{"id":967,"ended":true,"length":726,"text":"Federer started his season by participating in the Brisbane International as the defending champion, despite having a flu when the tournament started. However, in a rematch of the previous year final, he took a second place at the Masters. Although he didn't achieve his lofty goal, he was still able to get his fourth Wimbledon title. Federer also defeated his third Grand Slam champion, former French Open champ Roger Federer, in an epic thriller.\n\nFederer also lost the first two sets against his Russian opponent,,,,,,,. Federer came into Brisbane with a record of 4.9 Grand Slam titles and one title won by him in two years.\n\nBut the 36-year-old said that he had had the best tennis and was ready for the toughest work to come to him. \"I try to be as focused as possible at this point, just to really let a good experience out. \"Of course I know that I'm going to get more matches and that is very big for me \", he said.\n\nAsked whether he had any other advice for his next challenge that he wanted to give his fans, Federer said: \"I wanted to try to reach my best in the majors and I'm really enjoying being in Sydney.\n\nOn clay where Federer was the champion\n\nFederer also won the Australian Open (2004) with a 5-7(9) 5-3 victory over Jelena Ostapenko on Court One, while also losing against Alexander Zverev (2003). In the second of the five Masters titles, Federer won his 20th Grand Slam and his 15th Australian Open titles. On the ATP Tour, he defeated Kevin Anderson (2009), Nadal (2017), and Murray (2017).\n\nFederer won the Australian Open and first Grand Slam of his career with a record of 3.6 Grand Slam titles. He also won the US Open and Australian Open each, against Andy Murray.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult season, mentally, physically, just for my body. I lost my best tennis match so far and I hope that will continue in the next two or three weeks.\n\nFederer says it is important to show what he can do on clay\n\nFederer is in great shape, and his fitness levels have been up to the mark. Federer also got a break after a couple of years in London, losing in the quarterfinals to Rafael Nadal and Nick Kyrgios after both were injured.\n\nThe world number 30 said that he hopes to improve his performance in Brisbane, but will have to put in a few more weeks of intense training. \"It will be tougher in the heat and the heat is probably the most important factor for me \", said Federer.\n\nFederer has been training hard against his favourite players, the US Open champion and reigning Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.\n\n\"I do this because of Murray and he's my number one ranked opponent. But it is not easy, and not easy in order to get to where I want to be \". Federer added the importance of his tennis, as he has won 15 clay court finals, 14 singles and four games and has beaten Nadal and Kyrgios.\n\nThe 25-year-old also revealed that he was still recovering from a broken collarbone during the fourth US Open final and is currently undergoing therapy.\n\n\"It is very frustrating because I've always played the game well, it is still important for me to be able to do this\".

{"id":2885,"ended":false,"length":1013,"text":"Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in their electron configurations, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior. However, lawrencium is an exception, however, chemical behavior is determined by individual electron configurations, in a much more comprehensive sense, the laws of physics. It is well argued that, chemical behavior of electron-like states is a complex interaction between individual states ( ) and their properties. Although this paper is mostly devoted primarily to such interaction, the fact that the chemical system involved in electrons-like states are determined by individual atoms ( ) and ions ( ) is also relevant. In terms of chemical interactions, molecular electron processes are as follows, namely,, which are related to each individual electron state. This particular interaction has certain characteristics. In general, as in the case of electrons, they are similar to each other, and are similar to each other. The electron states are closely parallel to each other. This also applies to ions and electrons, the states being closely parallel to each other, and both electrons and ions are bound in their respective states. The molecular electron processes are very different. They are related to all other chemical processes or interactions involved in their nature, namely and to interactions in general. At the same time, they have certain characteristics. One of them is that the electron states, which do not belong as part of their state ( ) are less closely parallel to each other. The other is that the electron states, which do belong as part of their state ( ) are more closely similar to each other, and are also similar to each other. The interaction with which the electrons become connected to each other consists in their interactions between a single atom and its or its group. The state between which the electrons are connected is known as, and the state where the electrons become connected to each other consists in their interactions between many atoms. The ion interactions are based on a molecular interaction. This is achieved by the presence of a single atom, and the ion interactions are derived of the same atom, and are associated with all other ions and electrons. In fact, each ion or the ion-like state is independent of the other ion or the ion-like state which resides in it (.) It is well known that many electron states, called electron states, are directly related to particular electron states. It is further known that many electron states, called electron states ( ) are related to specific electron states, which are not directly related to a particular electron state (.) For instance,, an electron state, which exists in any specific atom, is called in a specific electron state. It is true that every atom has been named after its specific characteristic for various classes of these electrons. In the presence of different electron states, various group members (, ) are also connected to each other. In contrast, there is a state in which a group of individuals, called a group formed of electrons (, ), are responsible for a particular electron state. The group members do this through various interactions. This state (, ). For instance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,. In particular,,,,,,,,,,. In addition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.\n\nThe electron state is also related to all other electron states. In reality, the electron states were determined by chemical and functional interactions of atoms between different atoms ( ). Thus, their interactions are connected to the electron states. For instance,, the electron states in the same atom may be connected to each other in a particular way. Similarly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.\n\nThe specific characteristic for this individual electron state is that each atom has a particular electron. When each atom is connected to a small group of electrons (,, and ), the atomic states of each atom are located in the individual atom. The atomic states of any individual atom are also in the atom.

{"id":3967,"ended":true,"length":671,"text":"Since 1966, Bjor\u00f8y had been served by the < unk > \u2013 < unk > Ferry. The plans for a tunnel to Bjor\u00f8y were first launched by the engineer Jack Jahnsen in 1980, and were designed in the US. On 23 November 1988 a new roundabout was built, and a new road was constructed on the border of Bjor\u00f8y-S\u00f8r-Korte between Uruma and Norvalds (US) in the Swedish border area.\n\nThe Nordics will be one of the countries where the Nordics make significant progress. The country has received a number and major new development, including 3,000 new houses and hundreds of industrial sites. There are also plans by the Government of Sweden to support sustainable transport connections in certain regions. In 1994 the US joined the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Millennium Development Goals, which was considered a landmark development for the developing nations. The expansion of railways in Europe, including in Scandinavia, France, Finland, England, and Iceland, will also have significant economic benefits, which may include boosting food production in the Nordic countries.\n\nIn 2011, the government of Sweden committed $75,000 for the construction of a second runway and to build a new roundabout on the Nordics, as well as support for the construction of a second roundabout at S\u00f8r-Nordic Island. A similar project has already been undertaken in the UK where a new roundabout at Fife was already being constructed on a major artery between London and Northern Ireland. In December last year, the government of Sweden added a second roundabout at the northern coastal town of St. Barnabas (Sweden) after completing the transfer between the ferry terminal and the new roundabout at Bognor Regis (United Kingdom).\n\nThe Danish project \u201cMundin\u00f8re\u201d has been launched to connect the islands of St. Kitts in the North with the westernmost island of Denmark, and the Norwegian border area with Denmark \u201cHausland\u201d in Denmark\u2019s southernmost islands.\n\nThe first phase of the Nordics\u2019 economic development is designed to support local manufacturing, as well as improving the health of women, with the development of 4,350 new retail and small-business outlets, and the expansion of an infrastructure for maritime shipping, providing the construction of an investment of approximately $15 million to support the island\u2019s economic performance. A new phase of the development is also aimed at expanding the fishing and fishing industry, according to the Danish minister of tourism \u201cBannasj\u00f8rn Larsson\u201d. The first phase of the development is currently underway at Darmstadt S\u00f8r-Petersborg (Germany), with the first phase being inaugurated in Copenhagen on 15 February 2013. This new phase is expected to be completed by the end of 2010.\n\nThe second phase of the development is planned to improve the access to education in this region and will be built over the region, and also provide employment opportunities for young Danish workers. The first phase of the new phase of the development is expected to be completed in the autumn of 2013 (or early 2014 before a new phase is inaugurated in Copenhagen).\n\nThe third phase of the development is aimed at expanding the market for Scandinavian goods such as underwear. In Denmark, the Swedish market is dominated by Nordic and western vendors and many Finnish brands and brands are moving to the Swedish market (e.g. Jann Hansen\u2019s L'Argentine underwear, the Swedish clothing brand Jonssonalts brand, and Nordstrom\u2019s Swedish goods store).

{"id":1468,"ended":true,"length":713,"text":"Cayuga County, located in the Finger Lakes region of New York, has a highly unorthodox shape. Most of the county is only about 15 miles ( 24 km ) wide from its present-day town of Cayuga. On March 11, a group of about 20,000 Cayuga County residents, along with members of the Cayuga County Council, held up the Declaration of Independence through \"A New Way to Live\" for those of us who had lost loved ones or lost businesses.\n\nIn Cayuga County, the residents said the Declaration of Independence was very important for them to make their land and use it in an independent way. \"This Declaration has been put on the Board of Directors of Cayuga County since 1976. A resolution issued earlier today in favor and against this Declaration will be on the agenda to be approved today for Cayuga County Council,\" Cayuga County Council members said.\n\nCayuga County residents said that they believe that the Declaration is important because Cayuga is the heart of New York State and has many residents that are proud members of New York State. Cayuga County Council members said that the Declaration is essential to Cayuga County, as Cayuga is home to many farmers and industry that have become part of the New York State economy as a result of the State's economic development. Cayuga County Council members said that as part of their vote today, they would support the resolution.\n\nIn addition, the Cayuga County Council members said that they wanted to pass a motion to support the resolution and allow residents to use Cayuga for business. \"Cayuga County Council will support this resolution at its March 21 Town Meeting,\" Cayuga County Council Members said.\n\nCayuga County residents said that they were proud of the statement of support made by members of this group at the Village of Cayuga last night, following a decision to remove the Declaration from the board's agenda.\n\n\"This is about not only Cayuga, but the entire Cayuga community of New York State for the purpose of becoming a part of New York State. Cayuga County Council members and everyone in the Cayuga County community support this statement,\" Cayuga County Council members said.\n\nLocal residents also showed support for the declaration during a ceremony at the village hall.\n\nThe village hall is located in the vicinity of the Cayuga County Library located at 415 Stony Brook Street, with an area of about 800 square feet (5.1 metres), with an estimated capacity of 100 or so and an exhibit space of 800 or so.\n\nThe meeting of Cayuga County council and the Cayuga County Government on the Declaration of Independence for the past two weeks has been full of announcements about the Declaration. On Monday, members of the Village of Cayuga spoke against the resolution. They said that it was \"unfriendly\" and \"unconscionable\" to have Cayuga County Council voted against it.\n\nIn the last several days, Cayuga County Council and Cayuga County Government have begun a process of revising the proclamation for the town hall. The new town hall has been called \"Cayuga Town Hall,\" and many residents, including the residents of Cayuga County are excited about the new location and the new spirit of Cayuga.\n\nIn order to be fully successful in the re-appointment of Cayuga county council members as Cayuga County Council Members, Cayuga and Cayuga County Council must pass a resolution in support of the Declaration. Cayuga County Council will consider this resolution today. If the resolution passes, Cayuga County may appoint a new Cayuga County Councilmember to serve on the Cayuga County Town Hall Council.\n\nThe new Town Hall Council will meet today to decide the motion to hold a special council meeting. Once the Mayor and the Mayor's Council Members sign the town hall resolution, there is a chance for everyone to present their support for the

{"id":1282,"ended":true,"length":701,"text":"Honey has been used since ancient times to aid wound healing and may be beneficial in first- and second @ - @ degree burns. There is tentative evidence that honey helps heal partial thickness scars and burns on the skin. The FDA says honey has a much stronger physical and physical properties than water, but it will take time before we can confirm that honey-like chemical compounds can be used to treat burns. A study published in 2010 found honey containing the antioxidant Bp-20 may be protective against firefighting. It may help, too, in some cases.\n\nThis is one area where honey could also help. In one study, one researcher said honey has protective properties against firefighting agents and firefighters if honey had been absorbed from the skin by the skin.\n\nFor instance, a study on honey burns to prevent permanent burns using the water-saturated honey, published in 2008, linked with higher health risks to adults using the water-saturated honey. Even in cases where the water is saturated, honey can do damage to both the skin and the bone due to increased resistance. The researchers investigated how much honey that honey contained with a potential carcinogen could protect or worsen burns.\n\nWhen honey and water were mixed, honey and water were the most effective in treating burns. A study published in 2010 reported that the water-saturated honey could protect skin wounds better than honey alone\u2014meaning that burns would have less resistance.\n\nFor instance, a study in 2008 showed that honey showed higher protection when compared to water-saturated honey because it was also able to reduce resistance to cancer. Since the honey was water-saturated and free-flowing, a study in the United States showed that honey-based injuries can cause burns as small as 2%. The study suggested that honey-based injuries may have less significant effect on actual burns, while water-based injuries may damage the skin.\n\nWater-saturated honey can have some side effects:\n\nBecause honey can help with wound healing through its ability to block growth of cell wall tissue, it may also provide less protective benefits when used to heal wounds. Honey has been shown to heal wounds using natural materials, such as wood as well as artificial colors, though it is unknown whether it can be used to heal wounds from any source.\n\nOther studies have shown that honey can harm the body if ingested from food. This study focused on foods that have high levels of honey, such as apples, bananas and honey. In a study published in 2008, researchers reported that a study that showed those foods in a low-density fat intake were associated with a 30 per cent increased risk of burns. Another study published in 2010 showed there was an increase in the risk of burns after honey was given to obese individuals who didn't eat very much honey. In the current study, two more studies by researchers conducted using honey-based wounds are being reported again in 2012.\n\nHoney and water are also an important chemical in wound healing materials and may even benefit from protection against fires caused by chemicals found in food and fuel. In order to avoid the health risks associated with bees, bees need to be separated from their food sources. In recent years, bees have become increasingly reliant on bee food and the chemical-containing honey that helps to do so is a key ingredient in this process.\n\nFor more information, visit our website

{"id":3713,"ended":false,"length":591,"text":"In carbohydrate anabolism, simple organic acids can be converted into monosaccharides such as glucose and then used to assemble polysaccharides such as starch. The generation of glucose from compounds like pyruvate, lactate, and adipate is a continuous process. Although production of a variety of microglia, including monocytes, monocyte, and monocyte (Cetaceans including, eukaryotes and algae) occur simultaneously, they can be separated separately due to difficulties in separating them. The resulting product has difficulties for synthesis, and thus, there is a need for a new method that will be applicable to complex organic and\/or inorganic microglia. In particular, it will be considered that the number of microglia that can be isolated is increased as the number of cells in a complex complex microflora increases to a level of greater than one microglia and, at a similar level, the number of microglia that can be isolated increases to a level of at least 1 microglia and, at a similar level, both microglia and microtoxin cells in a complex microflora are isolated. The number of microglia can be increased or decreased by producing smaller cells, increasing and decreasing the number of microglia in the complex microflora, or increasing the number of microglia that can be isolated. Alternatively, it may be better (i.e. smaller) to isolate the specific microglia at smaller or higher concentrations in order to reduce the number of microglia of known types. Finally, it is known that many of the microglia can be isolated from one another at elevated concentrations and therefore the potential to synthesize complex polysaccharide compounds may be increased. In the present invention the microglia and the microtoxin cells may be isolated at such high concentrations that it can be made useful in many ways to synthesize polysaccharide formulations.\nThe present invention can be achieved by the use of different methods of separating individual microglia. For example, it may be possible to synthesize various types of oligonucleotides in any order, including oligonucleotides that are isolated in the same batch which are separated by centrifugation, etc., wherein the oligonucleotides are isolated from each other. The oligonucleotides are typically isolated by the use of an organic solvent. This method can be carried out on a single molecule or in a plurality of stages by a single operator, which consists mainly of the steps of producing both oligonucleotides and inorganic oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides can be purified by separation for separating oligonucleotides which are the first microglia that can be isolated from the first microglia. In this way, individual oligonucleotides can be separated by centrifugation, etc. The oligonucleotides are characterized according to the following general characteristics:\nThe number of microglia produced in such oligonucleotides is increased\nThe number of microglia produced in such oligonucleotides is decreased\nThe number of microglia produced in such oligonucleotides is increased\nThe number of oligonucleotides produced in such oligonucleotides is decreased\nThe number of microglia produced in such oligonucleotides is increased\nThe number of microglia produced in such

{"id":2920,"ended":true,"length":766,"text":"The vast majority of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ). DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of three or more pairs of DNA strands. Within each strand of DNA a single DNA strand, or the complete double strand, contains its corresponding genetic sequences. This means that each cell, once in existence, needs at least two DNA strands to establish its true origins. These DNA strands may be used to locate the ancestors of a certain species of organism, and the ancestors are stored in their DNA memory cells and kept up to date and are kept in memory cells.\n\nThe DNA in chromosomes is also distributed across chromosomes, which are comprised of long, thin strands that are often separated in favor of strands of more compact DNA. The lengths of this strand can be split to different parts of the genome ( a known function of molecular biology ). In addition to the long strands that are used to make up the DNA in chromosomes, and that is in most cases separated through a short strands of bone, DNA strands in the other direction include strands of other natural or non-natural DNA. DNA strand, or gene for short, have evolved themselves and become linked in the same way as natural DNA. It is also possible to make up one or more strands of DNA, e.g. as long as there are strands of an egg. In addition to the chromosomes, DNA carries out the functions of other functions such as interleukin-12 and interferons. In order to use the DNA for many of the other functions, as well as to make the individual strands of DNA more compatible with each other and the environment, the strands need to be placed in a solid or liquid matrix. It is possible, however, to insert cells in such a matrix into which the strand of DNA is wrapped, with some cases including the end product being placed in a liquid container. In some cases, the cells may also be covered with a layer of material.\n\nAnother feature of modern DNA transmission is that a DNA strand has been incorporated into the DNA of any cell within a cell, as shown in the following diagram in the figure. In general, DNA strands are usually made with a specific RNA polymerizing unit called a strand. This strand can be formed in the same way that DNA strands in biological tissues have been made. Although DNA strands may be inserted into biological tissues, all types of DNA ( i.e. DNA, RNA, DNA methylation and the like ) are of the common DNA. Furthermore, it is a fact that DNA strand can be formed via a single single strand. With such strands, for example..., there occurs the possibility of differentiating genes that are made by different cells. The RNA strand can be either a strand of a particular type or a strand of a DNA sequence. This strand of DNA is commonly called as an RNA strand. However, the strand should be of a different type. Differential RNA strand can be attached to certain DNA sequences. As long as all DNA strands contain the same DNA, the length of these strands. In addition, there is the possibility that there may be a different DNA strand. In order to find possible differences between the different strands and the strands.\n\nFor example, some DNA strands are labeled as. The DNA strand, or DNA sequence. is a DNA sequence that is split into two. Each strand and its component DNA strand contain different types of nucleotide sequence. For example,.,..,...,...,.....,.......\n\nIn principle, a strand of any type belongs to the DNA family. DNA and RNA. also belong to the DNA family.

{"id":4640,"ended":true,"length":727,"text":"Harvey formed in the central Atlantic, reaching hurricane strength only a few hours after first becoming a named system on September 12. From its initial position several hundred miles east of the Leeward Islands, harvey reached a new low of 65 mph (95 Km\/h), before the system slowly transitioned north, becoming a Category 4 (C) on September 14, the largest hurricane of the season.\n\nIn the Florida Panhandle of the west coast, the hurricane remained isolated on Friday, and the Florida Coast Guard sent out multiple rescue personnel to rescue dozens of swimmers and others stranded in their homes and beaches along with multiple helicopters.\n\nHarvey's sustained winds were 115 mph (170 Km\/h) and were the strongest to ever reach the United States.\n\nThe US National Hurricane Center advised that Harvey \"possesses very large amounts of tropical water\", and predicted the storm to be a \"major hurricane\", with significant amounts of rain and snow in many states.\n\nIt had moved ashore in North Carolina and remained on its way south in Southern New York. The storm's path was unknown until shortly before 5 p.m. on Friday, and some forecasters have projected that it will pass through the Carolinas and Delaware, with its winds near 40 mph (66 kph). At noon, the storm was expected to pass in the Carolinas.\n\nHarvey was originally going to hit the southeast coast on Friday at 6 p.m., but the hurricane's path was determined to be slow and it passed just before noon when it became a Category 4 Hurricane.\n\n\"It was going to make landfall at midday or late afternoon (Friday) and the effects could be quite severe,\" said Chris Ruckan, forecaster with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nRuckan said that it was too soon to say if Harvey will become a hurricane, and how long it will take to become a Category 4.\n\nHe said, \"Because of the size and weight of the storm, the winds could be incredibly high up, even on a Category 4 storm. We don't know how likely this is to get hit.\"\n\nIn the Carolines, some residents on Friday took to social media to wish Harvey well, and called the storm \"a big loss\".\n\n\"Harvey's path and the way he came in just was like a meteor shower,\" said John Stryker, a resident from Long Beach, California, who said he lived in a residential neighborhood known for tropical hurricanes.\n\n\"The way those wind blades swung it, it was like it was falling out. It was like a shower,\" he said.\n\nIn northern Georgia, the National Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the area of Long Beach, where Harvey was headed.\n\n\"This is a very large storm with a lot of water floating in,\" warned the National Hurricane Center in a statement.\n\n\"It may well be an exceptionally long day in the Bay Area because even with all of his rains, Harvey did not have an incredibly long day forecast,\" the center said.\n\n\"We hope that they can clear it up and go home quickly.\"\n\nForecasters added they were expecting the storm to pass the U.S. and Puerto Rico \"at the same time\" on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFor most, Harvey is a small, slow-moving tropical storm that has not made a full landfall yet. Its projected path is very short, its path almost always left and wide open for the hurricane to make landfall.\n\nIn the eastern Caribbean, Harvey moved into the Dominican Republic on Friday, with an estimated 5-10 mph winds.\n\nThe storm's center in the Dominican Republic has seen the greatest activity since Hurricane Ivan in 2011.\n\nThe weather service predicted it could become one of the strongest hurricanes on record, and its track would likely take 20 to 30
