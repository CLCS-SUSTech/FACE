It was the last period for Gothic, and it did nothing for the later work I've read.","token_len":116,"entropy":[3.5381,3.2891,3.5475,0.0221,0.6197,8.0596,9.5121,1.032,0.7936,5.4644,0.0534,9.0313,7.5998,2.3284,5.6934,7.4435,13.3256,8.8254,4.9789,8.7727,5.3041,8.6279,0.3361,11.733,2.3153,0.0868,0.0093,0.0037,12.9374,3.7292,7.3998,2.1531,4.2566,0.0348,1.9913,0.6161,2.9686,1.4774,1.9799,4.5417,2.4709,4.0116,0.5488,2.1618,1.6044,2.062,3.006,2.2314,0.1845,2.5595,5.2781,4.2574,3.4623,3.1915,3.3897,9.5888,3.0287,0.0256,1.0051,3.4399,3.6406,3.335,3.8137,0.6773,1.8401,2.5467,1.779,2.7668,4.5386,4.6191,1.1768,4.9797,5.4847,0.7786,0.8665,1.6711,0.1474,0.2118,8.3091,3.3005,3.7003,1.137,0.3548,4.8843,1.2842,1.2187,1.9607,5.6512,0.516,1.8323,1.0639,4.2112,4.209,0.3363,0.662,2.3398,1.8556,3.5313,4.1079,4.6578,4.3329,1.6232,2.1687,1.2309,1.7439,5.0423,6.3901,1.3298,1.615,4.6003,5.2652,3.463,2.2662,0.5499,0.5928]}

The chapel was opened in 1835.\n\nExternal links\n\nGreensboro-Henderson Anglican Church\n\nReferences\n\nSources","token_len":124,"entropy":[7.7498,4.9817,14.1228,1.859,3.49,4.8523,12.2329,0.1663,2.1798,7.5774,1.9174,3.9405,4.5077,1.8948,1.8987,7.373,0.0276,0.9641,10.1457,5.7845,1.8885,7.9443,6.2937,0.7475,0.0319,1.2252,2.435,7.2283,2.2165,2.8871,2.2386,4.9539,3.148,0.593,1.5447,1.2105,6.374,0.5875,7.5368,7.0867,5.8506,1.5291,2.8321,3.0305,0.0869,0.977,3.047,0.156,2.3377,8.3481,1.0283,1.9176,3.8723,4.4365,1.0762,0.4809,1.9931,3.7479,1.3037,3.0374,2.0775,3.3076,0.0223,2.6328,1.711,1.9294,2.5807,4.0028,0.7704,5.4249,2.1885,4.3509,5.6654,2.5321,1.5568,2.1681,3.468,2.3782,2.6761,0.3871,2.3065,2.3264,1.6368,4.058,0.0231,1.4349,4.3288,4.3148,2.078,6.0666,0.7607,0.3385,1.1046,1.8501,3.8865,0.8855,3.8897,0.6678,1.2918,4.1164,2.0712,1.3404,0.0103,8.5067,0.7907,1.3107,0.0003,5.4469,4.5234,1.2361,5.1836,3.4202,4.0132,0.1564,5.4928,0.037,0.6548,1.6299,0.0002,5.6776,0.9356,0.0003,6.1379]}

The Russian government, if it is not taken seriously, will be unable to effectively respond to threats as it always has.","token_len":137,"entropy":[7.6612,1.6302,7.2886,3.0879,1.4346,3.9389,10.8776,1.248,1.3771,5.5024,1.4957,0.6779,0.0034,5.2693,0.1994,4.5362,0.5481,1.6415,3.864,8.6368,3.1025,0.682,5.768,2.1434,3.391,10.7398,4.8706,0.0492,3.3234,1.9265,0.4949,7.5287,0.2949,0.5534,4.7383,0.0576,7.5311,4.3604,5.193,4.5688,0.0583,2.6633,2.1768,1.8575,1.3656,3.5303,4.5283,3.9488,0.8115,5.7837,1.1799,4.9146,6.3037,2.8554,2.0892,0.2362,0.5893,3.4819,0.6825,3.0122,0.627,0.6614,0.1919,3.988,4.5177,3.5216,2.0084,1.4695,2.5695,4.4312,2.48,0.1502,3.4294,0.1,3.9892,0.9656,5.1987,0.4434,1.1266,6.2558,5.491,0.7369,0.6633,1.3807,1.1382,0.001,5.406,4.7559,4.9851,0.6784,0.4709,5.8565,0.8106,2.7474,6.4675,0.1714,4.0814,2.6191,5.4295,0.7195,0.3601,0.909,1.1681,2.1782,1.2425,3.6446,5.3631,9.3611,0.6219,0.7546,3.8467,2.0715,1.6743,2.3046,2.8893,2.9207,5.0631,0.7604,1.9795,2.2373,5.9056,0.9186,0.3608,1.0137,3.0202,3.3156,0.1036,5.6862,2.2102,0.4191,5.8949,5.67,3.0765,4.6557,0.3812,0.9914]}

It is also possible to bypass the doors and make a very short journey by using the stairs to the castle of Saint Peter, and reach the castle through the Cathedral of St. Peter.","token_len":140,"entropy":[11.4942,3.737,1.4728,7.7374,3.9754,0.0103,3.6368,5.2864,5.3297,0.8223,6.7943,0.8688,0.5116,3.1287,7.3334,0.4681,6.3275,0.2755,0.3142,1.1371,5.031,1.1688,1.8719,4.7085,0.8371,0.3779,1.1538,6.3642,0.6164,3.0838,0.7355,3.6831,0.0853,1.2322,3.1728,4.8451,1.751,2.3943,1.4696,2.9255,0.3853,3.4747,0.7549,8.2539,10.6734,1.0355,1.6254,2.4464,0.5495,0.1033,0.1994,2.527,0.2166,1.9506,0.5265,2.7478,3.5245,2.9687,0.2025,5.7393,1.9953,2.3055,1.5181,0.9057,3.1224,2.8347,5.9323,5.1395,0.3753,4.0184,3.7967,0.6244,5.1695,1.5449,1.5538,0.9323,4.6333,1.9787,1.7302,5.6445,0.7517,0.2302,6.9727,2.6964,0.1871,4.7504,3.4338,2.6422,4.4924,0.1447,1.409,2.5642,0.5706,0.1718,0.5748,3.0698,0.1341,6.2714,1.102,4.2987,3.562,1.1274,3.6073,0.6812,2.3718,1.0116,0.1095,4.0769,0.3382,4.8517,2.2993,5.7158,1.5122,5.1819,1.0524,1.1659,2.7747,1.9879,0.6894,2.3665,1.3732,0.5397,5.4484,3.2455,5.4223,2.4387,2.4689,3.2882,4.8484,0.2246,3.3204,3.4646,0.4626,5.355,0.8527,1.0003,0.4437,1.2207,0.5961]}

{"id":4016,"ended":true,"length":124,"text":"The critical ionization velocity is the relative velocity between an ionized plasma and a neutral gas, above which a runaway ionization process takes place.

An ion-deposition process utilizes the interaction between the ionized plasma and neutral gas for ionization and ionization; the ionization process is typically carried out for a longer period of time than the neutral gas reaction. During these periods of ionization, ions are degraded, thereby releasing ions of lower density due to deactivation of the ionization process.","token_len":141,"entropy":[8.9106,12.5481,2.3165,6.3227,1.701,2.7643,5.3089,2.0644,3.218,3.55,1.6369,1.2719,5.247,0.31,1.22,3.3938,3.0599,2.0824,8.0942,0.8788,2.6576,6.9941,2.5231,0.9063,4.1611,3.4714,0.0186,0.3154,1.5046,2.6283,0.2191,0.1168,6.7999,1.0264,2.7253,8.8988,4.9166,4.6298,2.9212,2.9093,1.701,6.1273,3.109,1.989,1.9696,1.0269,2.2639,2.9177,1.4667,4.808,3.0762,0.4419,5.3549,1.112,6.7379,0.0787,0.0032,1.9215,4.9401,0.342,6.2316,1.3206,2.8024,3.6848,5.8637,0.5498,3.8009,1.4741,1.016,4.5617,1.2658,4.6489,4.6508,2.2926,1.1268,7.6744,1.6046,5.2207,1.8972,1.5556,1.3602,1.2708,0.8671,0.2218,2.2426,0.1291,4.6407,3.2722,0.7777,2.4507,2.6053,1.1824,7.5557,2.0159,1.6092,0.4998,0.7529,1.1195,5.1011,3.3266,0.0482,5.4431,1.4125,5.0965,0.9399,0.2229,0.0022,1.4147,1.4933,1.1513,0.4094,3.9148,1.169,5.5761,4.4781,2.2963,0.8855,0.4948,0.0568,0.2785,2.804,0.9481,5.6748,2.1985,4.2266,4.4345,3.0088,4.0302,4.0391,4.094,5.0147,0.0016,4.7078,3.9246,0.9717,0.5749,0.9324,1.4341,0.3395,0.4621]}

Following the formation of the Soviet Union, Romania declared war against the Hungarian nationalists and also entered into the war against the Soviet Union.\n\nReferences","token_len":166,"entropy":[8.6336,0.0961,2.138,0.3971,10.5009,2.463,0.076,0.0002,9.8978,9.6208,0.3152,1.8584,4.0623,0.0481,4.0813,1.0045,4.2601,1.2147,0.3565,0.3572,4.0882,5.0942,3.4867,0.2782,1.2233,4.5585,2.3471,5.76,5.2643,1.8286,9.7436,0.2659,8.3393,1.0867,3.2485,3.7627,0.9259,2.0536,1.4793,4.9669,3.5679,1.0591,2.4642,4.3408,0.7774,0.8557,4.7394,4.371,3.11,5.5653,1.5491,1.2275,3.9005,1.9323,1.4215,4.6061,1.8686,3.0602,5.3719,0.1772,2.6824,1.8087,0.8561,6.7687,3.8081,1.3607,2.1028,3.0489,5.0717,3.6813,0.8285,6.1357,1.1776,2.6888,2.4725,4.2655,6.0277,5.6361,5.6631,5.7165,4.9203,1.7034,0.1071,0.7538,1.3746,3.2254,4.1426,1.3563,0.5027,0.7044,4.9665,5.1718,1.3446,2.1826,5.4131,0.1994,0.0213,8.2247,2.6087,2.3774,3.151,0.0443,3.1716,0.1043,3.8421,1.6217,2.867,5.1661,2.0281,6.2859,10.7017,4.7907,1.79,2.9199,0.3367,1.0993,4.5571,1.9632,1.4371,2.669,0.0367,3.5064,0.548,0.2843,3.4885,5.2488,3.8703,0.7486,5.9374,1.6787,2.865,2.783,2.1734,0.0016,4.7393,0.9288,4.2817,0.6211,7.1304,0.0044,0.2531,1.8305,0.4153,0.7977,1.641,3.8878,3.6244,2.4233,1.4396,3.7183,6.5443,1.8002,4.7215,5.8898,0.8413,2.069,3.4703,1.0622,1.1877,2.5406,0.0899,0.7354,1.8648,0.0944,6.809]}
