We introduce him to the girls who love him, and he gives his hand. He lives a happy life, and is proud of himself and his children. He is always on time to the office. Then the story continues. There is a man that loves him, and he lives happy as a man. He is a father in the family, a man who loves his sons. He has two children with two different fathers, but that all is no fun for him for several days. Suddenly something happens, and he has a boyfriend. We try to make him into a bad boy, but he always says something different. Then we become more and more happy together. How can I love his son so much. I can not understand. The love he gets from his children does not make up for his loss. Some times I feel that. I am not a worthy daughter. But I am proud of him and just love him. It is easy to be proud, but the end happens.","token_len":224,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7876,3.0792,3.4547,2.4563,5.8451,3.4315,1.2931,4.5028,3.8991,5.1814,0.8946,2.4482,7.0397,0.5151,3.0528,4.6854,2.0033,3.0783,6.1732,3.1527,2.3076,4.4493,4.9861,1.1704,3.009,6.7891,0.4813,0.3193,1.7009,6.5221,2.4621,3.5264,0.0597,1.0896,0.921,1.8935,5.1777,2.7475,5.9404,2.9611,1.5139,6.5648,2.8342,2.7874,0.4302,0.8673,1.6852,3.1471,4.3713,0.423,2.8849,2.506,1.0168,4.611,0.2785,1.3802,1.6204,4.4523,3.9732,3.5973,3.5883,3.293,4.5921,1.7097,4.9721,2.7326,2.1298,3.9871,2.1588,4.1468,0.7169,0.7439,3.3169,5.3878,4.0497,1.9761,0.8509,0.6843,1.1133,3.7313,4.7204,5.0532,1.5577,0.7642,0.399,1.1664,1.225,1.9813,4.2769,4.738,1.9435,1.6652,0.8201,2.3868,2.4601,1.0859,1.9566,0.5603,4.0519,1.3216,0.9856,2.8223,3.4662,1.9659,4.1457,3.2311,3.076,1.9581,1.0711,2.6425,4.5272,5.9213,2.1939,6.6573,6.2055,2.1968,0.6786,5.8007,6.9634,2.2917,0.4899,5.5187,4.624,1.6138,1.6963,0.2687,0.9747,3.0505,1.8776,7.361,0.8989,3.307,4.8475,0.1752,2.9989,1.1525,5.3964,0.4317,7.0175,1.478,0.6491,0.837,0.7854,4.6082,3.3689,3.4085,5.0512,1.0996,2.4896,1.4619,6.0523,3.9038,0.9437,0.0016,4.969,4.2953,0.4972,6.6524,1.7598,2.9512,3.9519,5.7774,2.1789,2.7078,0.6293,5.7505,2.0991,2.74,3.761,2.9024,3.2254,3.0929,4.9354,3.0037,4.5905,0.776,0.9908,3.1191,4.6223,0.0535,2.2501,3.2451,0.1331,1.6365,2.5075,0.887,5.9753,5.4679,1.9005,2.3122,2.1437,6.7598,1.9088,2.2167,2.3488,2.956,8.5961,5.9303,1.3916,2.9758,1.0297,1.3916,3.8547,0.3556,2.1325,2.1418,7.1688,3.1539,0.1058,0.6386,3.4459,0.6009,4.4012,0.513,2.6776,3.0017,3.2934,1.2147,3.6261,5.6353,6.7886,1.6709]}

A love story that will make you feel sad or otherwise depressing or UNK. I am a human being and I have feelings about who I am, the people I share my life with, what I do for a living with and with my loved ones. I have been a Christian and a friend of Jesus, a devout Muslim and a practicing faith. My parents married very early on and each year, they would always find themselves wondering about life, whether they would ever be able to take birth or even live to see their children. It is a typical story of the relationship of husband and wife but there is something special about that story. I am sure that some of them will find it a bit depressing. But my opinion is quite positive, if you look at it all. It is a very beautiful story of faith and marriage. This story is a little different because there is not always the same way of showing a love story. For example, I can imagine my parents or some of my closest friends being happy or even unhappy. It is no surprise then. This is a story of faith and hope and love which we know how to relate to. I believe each new chapter of a life is different and it is important to grow and develop.","token_len":284,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7876,3.0792,3.4547,2.4563,5.8451,1.891,6.2424,5.0268,7.6954,3.3359,0.0393,8.4608,1.7101,0.1953,6.7012,9.0186,0.3031,0.71,1.4899,6.0963,6.7706,3.1955,1.5223,5.3593,1.2546,4.1784,0.9491,3.8437,0.2009,2.769,4.5881,7.4804,0.8878,4.6534,4.405,0.0683,2.1043,2.1379,1.7658,0.8216,0.4488,2.2482,2.7238,8.5983,8.1058,3.6813,11.5667,5.0985,2.6555,2.7447,2.7468,2.1581,5.7133,0.7824,1.7729,1.0526,2.4727,5.5867,2.5018,5.5008,0.2644,0.0518,1.6008,4.3032,2.2982,0.2841,7.2357,0.4776,1.3893,0.0083,0.2954,3.4714,0.3877,2.2489,2.0155,0.4831,0.0015,6.7219,2.949,3.8088,1.2742,3.5902,0.0347,0.6428,1.2325,2.6215,2.9075,2.9856,4.771,3.1686,1.9821,5.7749,0.2668,2.3601,2.5744,2.9932,4.8588,2.2914,1.2238,0.4227,5.3759,7.8826,2.2264,3.3798,5.1566,4.5075,5.4025,1.9109,2.7243,1.1492,5.4474,3.3421,2.6754,2.0472,1.9303,5.0727,6.0828,3.3919,4.7052,3.0009,5.9944,2.7275,3.5742,1.2433,2.6413,1.0619,1.447,0.5155,0.0081,4.2263,7.9793,2.9243,4.0123,3.3355,3.2628,1.0208,1.3374,1.4356,1.2534,3.4229,1.4133,2.0095,8.3331,3.4405,1.2262,3.1066,5.3159,2.8816,6.8953,0.3351,0.0062,4.8808,3.5603,0.9392,2.0964,3.2524,0.2729,3.415,2.269,0.7837,1.7694,1.8644,4.5483,1.2624,3.6254,0.8997,4.9807,1.3307,2.4647,1.7966,2.8858,1.8279,3.757,2.4167,2.5291,4.1669,7.1343,0.5138,7.378,2.1619,2.5048,3.9037,1.2885,3.4642,0.4062,1.836,5.9325,2.6525,2.9178,0.5136,1.5048,2.9248,3.5605,0.5584,2.0365,4.7992,0.8887,4.4636,1.0912,4.3423,1.7718,0.9081,2.3713,4.3349,1.8787,3.7322,3.1561,0.6155,3.2138,5.6738,2.7949,0.723,5.1045,1.5615,4.9571,3.0809,1.9483,0.0409,0.9764,3.6183,0.7804,0.2893,1.9192,4.2572,3.9891,3.1371,1.6697,4.7775,3.9593,0.6776,1.0496,2.4035,0.1836,2.6981,3.3075,2.9078,2.2032,5.2156,2.1468,2.7208,0.6119,5.901,2.265,2.8804,6.234,3.6488,1.0414,1.3038,0.8321,0.9219,2.6789,0.4259,6.24,1.1725,2.0704,5.2357,3.8616,4.626,5.6846,0.2261,3.4273,0.1491,1.4708,2.0784,3.1223,6.0617,6.1543,3.9801,1.069,3.3754,4.2236,1.0114,2.8954,1.2632,2.8259,0.5121,1.9582,0.5198,6.8451,2.0957,2.2962,2.2071]}

{"prompt":"In one or two paragraphs , show me a memorable character using only descriptions and actions -- using no dialog and avoiding adverbs .","text":"In one or two paragraphs, show me a memorable character using only descriptions and actions -- using no dialog and avoiding adverbs. Example sentences -- Let's say that we have a man and a woman. How are our characters related? How would you describe Mr. and Mrs. Mr.? They both are men, but have different characteristics. Instead, Mr. is a man and Mrs. a woman. What we know from these examples is that each of these characters are only used in limited cases and do not tell the whole story. In other words, they are only used to make sure that an action appears or nothing appears in the movie. For example, if we tell you a man and a woman does not make it through a water slide, he may say it's a joke. In this case, he means the same thing as saying it was a joke. But if we say something like, \"He went swimming a very long time \", it might say He went swimming a very long time. He is also not allowed to say anything other than the action for a given time and when they are spoken of. Example sentences - In one or two paragraphs, show me a memorable character using only descriptions and actions. In using only these, I show you only what is most relevant to the story. Use adverbs for only action descriptions and actions. You can use adverbs and descriptions as necessary.

{"prompt":"Write a few paragraphs about the renaissance period as if you are a complete idiot and have no idea what you are talking about .","text":"Write a few paragraphs about the renaissance period as if you are a complete idiot and have no idea what you are talking about. The first renaissance was the time of the first Renaissance of European culture, beginning in the mid - - 15th century. What a Renaissance, as one who speaks of the renaissance is not. The Renaissance began there, and continued there, and continues there. On the other hand, a real Renaissance begins at a specific moment in the history of the country of origin. As some authors seem to disagree, the Renaissance seems to have had the most dramatic and diverse history in its history, and is the most spectacular and spectacular of the ages. But who is really the Renaissance in your current culture, and in your experience and perception of the time around? Who is in the limelight in your experience of this period of time? It is not all that easy to assess the meaning of this period of time in your culture. The question that needs answering is the nature of the Renaissance, the Renaissance itself, and the nature of your current culture. It is not just about defining these terms, rather it is a question of understanding the meanings of these terms. If this is the case, then the meaning of this period of time in your culture is understandable and true. If not, then it's not valid understanding. But if the meaning of this time period turns out to be a misunderstanding, the misunderstanding is a misunderstanding. The significance of this period of time is that it gave birth to one of the great philosophies and the great spiritual traditions, which were, as a single phrase can already be seen, the great Renaissance movements. This period of time created both great philosophical movements and spiritual traditions. For example, the philosopher Zeno, the philosopher, and the philosopher of mathematics could have met. It is clear, from the beginning, that each great philosophic movement followed in some way something that had originally been.","token_len":385,"entropy":[4.0641,4.1033,3.677,1.7625,1.7719,11.2991,6.9504,4.9128,5.3438,2.8739,3.3103,2.1958,7.3424,3.3691,1.9003,3.9448,1.4406,0.6175,0.5254,1.5801,0.3912,0.2808,0.0017,0.3092,3.2537,3.587,9.3511,1.497,2.4575,4.8187,2.3927,1.617,4.5002,5.745,4.6252,4.5569,3.8366,1.5064,5.3654,1.0658,0.6481,3.9673,7.4327,7.342,4.1202,0.2635,0.129,0.7164,5.2893,3.9138,6.1171,2.5425,4.1051,5.1098,4.6633,5.6704,0.9543,2.4983,4.2768,2.8827,2.3221,5.428,1.866,1.0286,3.3782,6.4281,1.1597,1.59,4.5891,3.1275,1.6672,1.4917,4.0384,2.907,0.8592,6.5814,0.7164,1.5112,0.0783,0.1087,4.2739,6.474,1.0256,3.6546,2.8732,2.5772,3.3657,2.2164,0.7828,2.196,0.6098,0.0352,1.5355,4.7437,4.3703,2.0021,1.2966,4.1735,6.0113,5.3019,6.0559,0.0421,7.2428,0.4785,1.2958,1.7025,6.58,0.219,0.8939,4.4988,2.9514,2.6011,2.5253,2.1631,6.2091,3.3738,1.253,5.0564,0.807,1.5089,1.5306,3.4814,2.0532,1.6093,5.9801,1.4691,4.6456,2.6112,1.7804,6.0479,0.42,3.6318,5.6459,1.3651,3.6471,2.3051,1.0686,3.7136,4.5776,6.1132,4.8413,1.8656,1.054,4.833,1.1628,6.1072,4.2225,5.3536,0.7248,1.1229,3.901,6.09,3.5421,3.3898,0.5328,5.0622,1.7688,8.7175,0.0087,2.7195,0.8116,4.4192,1.178,2.8963,1.4954,2.2879,2.5682,0.5226,3.998,0.8365,1.9161,4.7057,2.0081,2.8153,0.4892,5.8615,1.1786,4.3665,0.2371,2.5437,1.2942,1.3688,0.72,3.1949,1.081,2.5249,0.5452,2.453,3.8286,3.1385,3.5623,3.044,0.3214,3.677,4.1288,0.1635,0.6359,1.3102,2.0777,2.1777,3.7872,3.6919,0.8424,0.8018,1.0315,3.5742,0.0695,3.5961,3.4926,0.5687,0.2637,2.9445,0.4006,1.6337,2.9429,1.7403,6.3132,6.1444,2.6215,1.2709,6.6412,1.2971,0.0908,3.4782,1.3659,0.3035,2.8646,1.2703,5.31,0.5438,1.0848,0.2033,0.8066,3.6587,4.2514,0.7793,1.3353,1.3042,0.1866,0.9056,1.8226,2.5235,0.1835,2.1501,0.5479,0.4162,0.2411,3.8221,0.2691,0.4886,0.7517,8.4367,2.1038,5.6856,0.5084,2.0991,2.3212,0.0863,0.24,1.714,4.0789,1.1107,6.3096,9.4303,1.2662,2.9198,1.0078,2.5746,0.4093,0.2498,0.5639,4.1563,5.7566,8.3858,0.1378,0.0581,0.0789,2.9963,3.9935,0.6841,4.5194,5.235,1.0905,3.0854,4.0885,0.8037,2.0051,6.5245,0.1108,0.6889,0.9115,0.2441,0.1922,0.8728,1.5487,0.5817,4.1407,1.5778,0.0573,4.9577,0.1579,0.0904,2.4082,5.9919,2.6862,3.3097,1.8066,5.5152,1.532,2.6478,2.3865,2.9117,4.0694,2.6362,3.0409,7.6023,7.0811,4.9766,6.6773,0.0673,2.1224,0.1856,1.5885,3.3046,5.019,5.0763,1.0849,2.7618,2.0573,0.5665,0.4128,5.1384,5.7442,2.9038,3.4585,2.9804,0.8232,3.2394,0.9103,1.1571,4.6046,1.5625,0.0753,1.0459,4.4686,4.602,0.5659,2.4222,2.1079,2.2023,5.7051,2.4133,0.5413,1.3953,2.3965,5.304,6.0009,2.4071,5.9977,3.6332,3.3127,1.0665,4.2925,2.743,2.7451,0.8997,2.9826,0.9074,0.1765,4.7584,6.3746,6.1491,0.2477,0.2026,6.3429,3.711,4.9205,0.7187,5.9375,2.1563,2.6878,5.514,0.4286,6.6919]}
