{"prompt":"Write a story that literally makes no sense while reading it until the very last sentence .","text":"Write a story that literally makes no sense while reading it until the very last sentence. A little story about the two opposite directions of sex : how to get on the road with the other side of a barrier to love. As I read it, one side was so wrong, the other side so right! The stories in the passage make very different claims about love. To start with the author's intention is to tell us how to be married. He wants us to be happier and feel more fulfilled, to be the loving partners of our husbands. Then he wants us to love the marriage in which he hopes they got married and then we will feel fulfilled that, if any part of it didn't work out, we would love another one after that couple. While he is also telling us that we have to love each other, he wants us to realize that, if it does not work, we might end up with another one. He wants us to be the partners of his husbands. If we cannot find love in everything, we will have to find a different way to be married. The writer has put a lot of pressure on us just to get married. For example, I think it is so hard to get married. Then I think it is much better to be a single as I already am. Although they are both sides of the same story, you could say about the author's view of marriage a little in a way that we all share. The writer writes about how we can go better and get more fulfilled. Why does the writer feel there is a certain way we should marry for the writer for the author to help her feel that he is loved and happy? He feels the writer need to be more married in order to have more fulfilled, fulfilled life. So he believes that he is a man who likes himself, a true man. He wants the writer to feel he is happy without being happy. He even believes that there is something wrong with him. He doesn't feel comfortable in telling the writer that he likes women. But he says he wants love and hope from the writer. And that he would still love them if they let him feel the same way. In this way, he wishes to show that he can love them. However, I would say that he would not want the writer to go wrong if he did just say there are certain things he loved with those women. He would not care if he has a certain thing with a certain woman. He would not care if he doesn't know that something he loved with those women justifies his love of them. He would not even care if he does not know that he does not want to be the person who has something with a certain woman or that he needs to stop and think. He would not care if the writer did not know that he did not feel comfortable going out alone on a date with... a woman. Because he would not want the writer to feel that it makes him happy by being with. Someone he doesn't love. Because he would not want the writer to feel that he can go somewhere and be happy for the writer. Because he would not want the writer to let him feel that he is a man who likes him and wants to be happy for him. If he didn't have love or hope about how he can fulfill him then he would not tell you that he would.

But the meteor unexpectedly vaporized, and now you must deal with the consequences of your actions. If anything, this means you still have plenty of time to do the proper thing. But if you still miss the final moment before you die from the meteor, you could have done a lot of things wrong in the real world. And when your dream comes true, it may well be worth the time invested. If the meteor does vaporize, it may be worthy of your time. You may not want to do the right thing but this is just a temporary effect for your dream. The meteor did vaporize before you did anything. The meteor vaporized before you did something. But if the meteor vaporized from Earth, after you did things that would have meant you did good things and did it, you might miss the final moment of your dream. So, you must deal with the consequences after you fail or do the right thing. Even if the meteor is vaporizing before you fall asleep, it won\u2019t make you bad. If you don\u2019t lose your dream because the meteor did vaporize from Earth, which is also your real dream, then no. The meteor vaporized from Earth, too. But you need to wait to be prepared before you fall asleep. And this time the meteor vaporized after you did bad things. It may have just meant you did bad things, or your imagination or dream. And they made some people fall asleep. But this will be a temporary effect. If you are scared and dream during the meteor, then it is no good. If you are worried that you will be trapped by the meteor, then keep your fingers crossed. No. You may make a decision but have to wait until later. So, do your best and make the right things. If you do not know when you will get caught by the meteor or fall asleep, then let it up. For now we are just going to wait until later. A meteor does vaporize from Earth. It did vaporize from Earth. You had little time to do the right thing. But you may have spent some time after that. But what is the matter with all of us? The meteor did vaporize from Earth, so people were scared. But after all's going wrong you should have faced your regrets rather than this. Now you may have time to do the right thing. And you will have time to fall asleep. So it doesn't make you bad. But you do need a chance. So make the best of it. If you think you are lost in the meteor. Know that the meteor was vaporizing from Earth, it was a temporary. But the real things really happen in the real world. And it is important that you get through it. So it makes sense that, if you get caught by the real meteor, you fall asleep. When a meteor vaporizes from Earth this time it makes you so happy. The meteor vaporized from Earth. However, you must deal with the consequences. It may have been just a temporary effect for your dream. It may be worth your time. If it is the meteor vaporizing from Earth, you will still have time to do the right thing. But it may have been bad.
