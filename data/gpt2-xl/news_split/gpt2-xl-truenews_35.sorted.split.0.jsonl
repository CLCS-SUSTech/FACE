Tensions have continued to rise after North Korea carried out a fourth nuclear weapons test on Sept. 3\n\nThe missile is intended to make it easier for the country to deliver nuclear missiles, and to expand its missile capability as well, according to North Korean state-run media outlet KCNA.\n\nJapan is not aware of the missile.\n\nIt is the second time Ri has flown over Japan. In March, he arrived in the southern island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, accompanied by two other senior regime officials. Ri and his colleagues have met with several officials and businessmen in preparation to hold a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, scheduled to take place later this year.","token_len":168,"entropy":[10.911,6.6904,1.2759,6.9963,2.9518,0.9754,0.0198,5.0522,0.0074,5.1846,5.7382,2.4985,4.1255,0.3439,7.3138,0.8458,6.3091,0.1284,0.7385,1.9071,5.5832,0.8029,0.766,0.0172,0.0005,1.463,3.3542,0.8456,0.0382,2.0691,9.0451,0.9491,1.2645,4.5593,0.0433,0.4559,3.266,0.6261,0.0239,1.9444,0.0013,1.2879,1.9881,0.0554,4.0085,0.0093,0.6969,0.9276,0.0127,0.0535,6.741,0.0008,2.5264,5.4999,3.5909,6.3542,0.2822,5.4708,1.9147,1.8289,0.2451,1.1989,2.6113,0.2076,2.3574,1.0955,4.4975,1.9505,2.9699,2.7563,4.522,0.3646,1.7344,2.7204,4.0908,0.8498,1.2046,1.7017,0.0039,3.1535,1.2617,0.288,3.1291,0.0638,0.2021,5.6501,0.5846,0.0,0.1595,0.374,0.0002,3.9055,2.3021,3.2362,5.1099,0.1297,0.7543,1.5077,4.2582,0.7148,0.0002,3.9713,1.2312,1.7285,1.7309,1.0078,7.3053,0.5224,3.3061,2.1851,0.6389,2.3455,1.3975,2.8182,0.4134,0.4239,4.5952,0.4881,2.3371,2.6392,1.8835,0.0845,1.6079,5.3985,0.0022,0.0052,1.5997,5.0106,0.0118,3.1953,1.7099,2.5189,6.0491,0.1252,0.5907,4.0946,2.6665,0.8989,3.7698,4.7348,3.3292,0.2207,2.9942,3.8558,2.1365,3.1577,1.1041,7.4393,3.8657,2.9437,1.5314,2.0515,0.8671,0.9532,0.1427,0.0052,0.006,0.0003,2.2484,3.6326,1.4889,0.3429,0.0018,2.4276,0.0546,1.4134,0.0918]}

On Nov. 20, Trump signed an executive order declaring his new administration will begin building a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and hiring 5,000 additional border patrol agents.\n\nThese policies will undoubtedly increase anti-Muslim sentiment. However, it is easy to forget that these policies also have the potential to turn some immigrants into hate groups who can inspire deadly acts. While we can't know for certain what effects Trump's policies would have on the country's Muslims, any effort to further restrict Muslim refugees and ban Muslim immigrants shows a dangerous disregard for American values and civil liberties.","token_len":181,"entropy":[5.8932,2.992,0.3923,4.5682,1.9448,0.0273,7.287,1.2266,2.9466,0.4589,0.062,3.907,4.2482,0.4618,1.7671,2.7309,0.9452,0.4902,6.3211,2.5095,5.5528,0.1829,0.238,0.0258,2.5556,2.5179,2.3947,3.2356,1.856,1.8229,0.8924,1.6725,0.0923,0.0735,0.5588,0.001,0.1309,1.0819,0.0002,3.4965,1.7088,4.2706,1.2608,0.0543,1.1411,1.7597,0.0199,0.8465,3.2589,0.1911,5.7617,1.394,3.2434,1.47,2.3193,2.7291,1.1391,1.3792,0.9955,2.079,0.8192,4.6086,4.0787,0.0034,2.6129,0.0466,2.4913,1.0885,0.3725,0.1227,0.0272,6.0754,3.1758,5.7977,2.6048,2.6802,3.2242,5.7954,0.1799,0.2468,1.2173,0.0202,0.948,0.0014,0.0004,0.1058,2.9164,0.0001,0.0041,1.3471,4.3769,0.618,0.0003,0.0014,1.3541,1.4883,0.5207,0.3351,0.4009,0.8841,0.0003,4.3592,2.4256,1.7334,4.5072,2.4325,6.5918,0.0009,0.8828,1.4354,2.1899,4.3011,0.007,2.7384,0.564,5.9028,0.0694,1.1423,0.2341,3.4894,1.037,2.1522,2.768,0.6601,0.2851,0.0355,5.095,3.8064,3.5195,1.0708,3.0979,3.3378,4.9322,4.6094,4.5179,4.7687,1.7613,1.4992,5.6012,3.2275,2.074,0.7146,1.6599,1.3294,1.0512,1.4868,5.9985,1.2065,0.0591,1.1698,3.7532,0.0236,0.347,1.7749,3.0364,1.0923,2.9213,0.1677,6.2728,4.5759,0.098,4.6434,2.0094,1.9672,3.0439,1.9412,5.0709,1.4692,0.8205,6.4501,1.076,2.9536,1.3286,0.0345,3.454,0.1968,1.3701,2.8109,0.8591,0.0808]}

On Thursday, Mr. Franken announced he would be joining the staff at the American Federation of Radio and Television Telescreens with a pay of $185,000 for one year.\n\nWith additional reporting by Joshua Dawsey and Stephanie Ruhle,\n\n\u00a9 Washington Post","token_len":188,"entropy":[1.9365,0.2328,0.125,5.176,5.7916,0.1513,0.0001,0.0002,1.2411,2.8209,1.7801,0.002,0.0604,0.3167,0.141,0.0283,0.2385,0.311,1.1989,2.7265,2.2608,0.715,9.6609,2.7612,4.724,0.0028,1.2548,0.4221,3.7488,1.7385,0.0016,2.9783,0.3142,0.0856,1.0314,0.109,0.2785,14.3518,11.9357,0.7833,0.0022,4.142,0.0671,0.6245,2.7349,0.9309,0.5662,1.0809,0.9855,1.4318,1.1072,0.2875,3.8631,1.4612,2.4955,5.6127,0.0354,1.1145,1.9765,0.6337,4.0435,0.518,6.2327,0.2493,1.7482,1.6868,0.0008,4.3886,0.1058,0.0511,0.4528,0.0018,0.055,6.018,0.4459,7.2275,0.2029,1.1183,3.3144,0.5446,0.1475,3.6354,0.5654,2.6919,0.9434,0.5324,2.4842,1.4281,0.0083,3.2566,4.8374,0.4483,1.8633,5.1412,1.4389,1.3594,3.2751,0.0858,2.544,2.0947,1.433,3.0257,0.0183,6.0481,0.002,1.9114,0.3395,0.2404,2.4129,0.2161,2.4238,1.6943,0.5584,0.5605,3.2338,0.2214,4.2404,0.5172,4.2852,0.8745,2.2607,4.7992,0.2687,1.9001,0.9342,2.921,2.7812,2.3669,0.5577,1.4961,4.0559,0.6284,4.8877,1.4969,0.1776,0.8336,0.0015,0.0693,3.0571,1.0178,0.3742,1.6975,5.5604,0.9372,4.3339,2.5516,0.8642,4.0384,4.8158,0.0178,4.4794,0.4213,0.1218,4.571,4.8937,6.8689,0.8639,4.4223,1.2663,0.2467,4.3859,0.002,0.0843,4.1636,3.5011,0.0721,0.3337,1.2409,0.0004,5.6978,6.0085,0.061,0.1175,5.3707,5.7598,0.0192,1.3371,5.4628,5.3125,0.0007,0.0185,4.0956,2.1889,0.0002,5.1118,2.9483,0.0084]}

The battle is not won. We have to do more. We have to act. In the coming years, we have to ensure that our planet will not fall into the sea and that we can have a planet on which our children can live.'\n\nHe said there was no turning back, regardless of Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, warning that without change to the way our economy is organised our children would have an even harder time walking on the green planet they need.","token_len":196,"entropy":[4.5227,1.8234,0.0006,3.8079,2.0635,4.4634,7.5343,0.0081,3.253,0.0117,3.639,7.3073,2.71,1.4437,1.4201,1.5311,3.206,0.9033,0.2244,1.8261,0.3841,6.4483,2.5317,5.1278,0.5453,0.6847,0.5512,0.4009,0.0086,0.7541,7.4385,11.3919,6.2815,3.9127,0.2299,0.0019,2.2886,4.3448,2.9671,0.431,0.8253,1.9651,0.3093,8.9744,0.0004,5.0972,0.9394,1.2827,1.1342,0.5626,1.3655,0.7113,2.1688,0.0011,0.1047,0.9065,2.5576,1.6428,0.1984,4.4157,4.1434,0.695,0.1947,1.9867,0.9975,1.8714,3.4619,1.473,2.1449,1.4095,4.051,5.5483,1.588,0.6317,2.4724,2.7966,1.1691,1.1943,1.6007,2.1682,0.1215,0.1126,0.6985,2.4254,0.7107,0.9433,0.5601,0.088,0.821,0.0003,2.3186,0.0006,1.4833,1.9902,1.0776,1.2802,1.3297,1.0839,4.1594,2.0608,2.4913,1.3275,1.1337,1.143,0.7669,1.0168,1.9628,0.515,1.6995,0.3433,0.9436,0.8602,0.6107,0.0792,2.2663,1.8449,4.6891,1.4295,1.7791,0.9244,0.5151,1.1167,1.4289,0.0917,4.9976,0.5615,2.1996,1.4667,3.2763,1.2861,5.3916,0.8829,0.9114,1.6195,2.9668,1.1084,1.3202,2.4076,3.8043,0.8441,4.269,4.1299,0.0336,2.6171,0.0777,0.9688,0.6626,1.1925,1.2271,0.0003,1.9697,1.3846,3.6925,0.9742,1.4787,3.0185,0.0295,1.9584,5.3828,0.0168,4.5661,0.1638,3.7023,0.266,0.0191,0.4921,0.3407,1.8287,4.7102,0.8426,4.1145,5.3387,3.9964,0.6933,0.7857,3.4418,1.0926,1.8239,2.4517,4.4136,1.4722,1.4033,2.738,4.3604,0.7722,1.093,0.1916,5.8914,0.8288,0.3786,4.6186,0.8049,1.9754,2.5987,0.8337]}
