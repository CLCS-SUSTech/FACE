I think that I would like it even more if the manga would be serialized on shounenban or on a magazine.","token_len":162,"entropy":[9.3896,2.3466,8.0272,0.4451,7.2496,4.5532,3.6242,3.5914,3.6854,4.089,2.1223,3.2656,0.1711,0.5109,1.2938,4.393,5.7287,1.7136,10.5708,0.3479,0.2009,3.3246,2.3723,8.2317,1.0416,0.7938,8.9018,0.1359,0.1089,5.8227,10.2214,2.7641,0.1241,5.1403,0.1024,4.6036,1.681,4.4779,0.3515,4.2351,6.5342,2.9537,0.8815,4.7307,0.4886,4.6972,0.8024,1.5818,3.2142,1.0741,2.0375,1.1504,0.5673,1.6374,0.9573,3.1739,1.3204,1.1248,4.5279,4.2211,1.9439,1.4257,4.6374,5.912,3.468,4.8379,5.9953,2.7089,4.1203,2.2649,0.7321,0.6461,1.4894,2.626,3.1313,5.6151,5.9446,5.6558,4.3729,2.3606,2.304,0.7097,1.276,0.0001,3.7378,1.2716,1.6843,0.9623,1.5909,3.173,0.4334,2.0278,0.4427,4.0301,1.5159,1.1483,2.562,2.9248,1.3948,1.0617,4.6393,6.1121,1.119,2.3097,0.8296,2.1447,2.1428,5.4921,1.1734,4.7807,0.8654,3.3458,3.6008,3.3184,4.6754,1.8977,1.6863,0.0145,2.409,0.9018,1.4398,2.5728,3.7371,2.5307,5.2604,5.757,0.0265,0.4065,0.9674,1.8628,7.3882,4.7658,4.7033,1.6678,0.6738,3.0398,3.1325,1.0265,3.9277,2.9968,2.3123,2.1296,0.6923,0.1929,0.1599,2.0446,2.6583,3.2291,1.2694,4.0645,0.0263,3.1661,5.2921,1.2816,0.003,4.3129,3.0323,2.972,2.0751,2.9171,0.7975]}

During the game, the player must find allies in the war-ravaged city where he is located and then fight for protection.\n\nA small, quick version of this game with two players is available here.\n\nDownloads\n\nFor information on how to play this game, download a printable A5 PDF:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gaiusgoyte.com\/featured\/printable-the-gunfight-or-the-gun-game-1.pdf","token_len":186,"entropy":[8.3942,3.0027,5.2568,11.2155,0.1818,2.2615,5.1407,2.6314,2.7071,4.6922,2.8891,0.8017,12.141,3.9678,3.923,3.7162,3.9475,0.4664,1.4544,4.1635,3.7202,1.6587,2.9955,1.0643,1.0009,1.3011,0.0109,4.0749,1.7209,4.9437,0.8094,1.7917,3.3949,2.0334,4.6103,1.0446,5.8208,2.1351,2.1792,2.8328,3.1781,2.9634,3.3681,1.2416,0.3033,0.382,5.5295,2.163,3.8955,3.8771,2.022,4.6175,1.3528,1.6897,2.5706,2.0881,3.0387,4.4684,0.7775,3.0497,2.0455,4.6592,0.5895,0.2193,3.6503,4.2928,0.2793,2.1192,1.882,1.6429,1.3637,0.3587,1.0005,4.9954,2.1522,0.8042,4.8615,0.0314,0.6751,0.0021,0.5633,1.4398,4.0386,0.7101,3.4227,0.1791,0.8853,2.257,3.1959,4.0194,4.9873,3.3905,0.9942,2.5771,0.8766,2.0208,0.0003,2.7997,6.2565,2.2826,2.1754,3.7458,1.9812,4.0645,3.0386,2.1596,6.8907,2.0154,1.0999,0.0002,4.0455,4.7452,2.8855,4.4291,5.874,0.1042,2.1298,0.5434,4.5258,4.8635,1.1652,1.2703,0.902,1.2086,0.5449,0.4963,0.0002,4.6675,1.7045,0.4737,0.0003,4.6476,4.2422,0.6558,1.1806,0.0439,1.1205,2.1582,0.1041,0.2642,3.5296,2.9186,2.2539,1.7445,5.882,1.5992,3.53,4.2807,1.2136,0.0002,3.7375,0.0014,0.7122,0.0191,3.9051,5.2311,3.7726,3.233,5.7867,5.7207,0.2444,0.1604,0.0191,4.9529,5.1248,0.9652,5.9697,0.4911,0.8225,5.8309,0.0255,1.7542,3.8525,0.1784,5.3571,0.0298,1.1278,0.0054,2.1873,1.2439,2.7332,0.9084,3.244,1.0076,0.5463]}

And second, I wanted the book to be very short: I really wanted readers to read and think about what they had just read, and not read a second time until they knew exactly what happened.","token_len":193,"entropy":[6.8425,11.1854,2.4195,6.6039,2.3469,6.9641,4.8241,3.8865,1.1811,0.2447,0.0112,6.9233,2.4615,3.2262,4.6119,0.882,0.8764,1.2935,3.0861,2.37,0.6939,2.8288,2.2201,1.3048,1.793,5.6967,2.6545,4.8236,0.3289,1.8429,2.137,3.5897,1.3247,6.7894,3.8003,1.4034,5.3595,1.5639,0.8776,3.1036,3.9256,0.0004,3.0294,1.3731,4.756,1.9497,1.2022,4.2934,0.4458,3.1165,0.0312,4.2102,5.1354,1.5934,0.4168,3.0184,4.5722,0.4358,2.5835,1.5264,6.1049,0.5099,6.2315,2.9305,0.2516,2.6644,0.765,5.0186,4.1772,1.8622,3.1824,2.1977,3.8495,1.0984,2.8568,2.3968,1.9143,0.2393,3.0296,5.1869,3.8304,0.0678,0.2621,2.5931,3.8328,5.2748,1.7415,5.3601,1.8936,5.6344,0.5949,1.3918,2.7612,0.0006,4.1707,5.7087,1.5044,2.1932,4.5434,1.8119,3.1979,0.8374,4.4692,1.6203,0.8291,2.1009,3.4754,2.7469,1.1184,4.0387,2.6279,2.6807,2.4424,0.1292,4.9433,0.6689,0.8152,0.3173,4.2895,0.1883,0.5554,0.0391,6.746,0.9462,4.2123,0.3728,5.0162,1.3629,3.5918,1.593,1.7427,0.1579,2.8303,1.4811,3.664,0.529,1.6461,3.2433,0.5145,1.6948,0.0006,0.5499,0.2868,1.7867,5.0794,1.5547,0.5693,2.1725,3.4368,1.0333,3.4274,0.8952,2.3784,3.7286,0.1187,0.6134,1.2276,2.9449,1.382,0.0465,0.6248,2.6053,2.4693,4.1329,1.4688,5.7472,0.5513,3.363,0.0409,2.0373,4.6355,3.0216,0.9419,2.3963,1.3898,2.184,0.4408,0.081,1.5817,0.7484,2.5714,3.2839,3.0521,2.1287,0.3613,2.3275,0.4776,3.6528,3.4793,0.2349,2.1895,0.3957]}

As its metal elements were replaced by fire, air and water, Earth became still another world. However, it is interesting to ponder the fact that Earth survived being changed by the elements so that it was still recognizable to the people who lived on Earth on that time. That is to say, Earth did not give up on being an element: it remained an element. As a result, Earth can change another element into another element, like it did with Fire and Water, but it cannot change the metal elements itself.","token_len":193,"entropy":[7.2898,6.5353,10.0861,3.1961,1.4659,5.078,4.2755,0.7112,3.2854,1.0512,6.1843,1.0433,0.2398,3.538,4.6858,9.3374,0.162,0.8618,0.8646,0.0398,1.7529,2.3543,9.7512,0.9686,7.2313,0.827,2.9977,1.9048,0.5792,8.7393,0.8641,2.3944,0.0059,2.5185,0.6964,1.5475,0.3378,0.0722,0.6601,0.3296,0.1934,0.0436,0.1313,0.3234,0.0052,2.9013,1.3691,0.6491,0.2229,0.0967,0.0588,0.0645,0.7934,0.018,0.0399,0.1792,4.2262,2.1869,5.2072,4.9391,5.1913,2.3149,5.433,1.8791,1.2183,3.6737,3.6877,4.0335,3.7775,1.9687,3.2062,5.6516,0.0021,0.5185,4.9431,2.685,3.2137,0.4485,4.9528,0.2141,0.2099,0.3988,8.3412,6.6443,1.5759,5.7984,2.9626,2.4925,0.7184,4.7496,4.581,4.1706,2.5279,2.1325,2.6727,0.5617,5.5822,0.5918,3.43,1.0417,0.0261,0.1833,1.2884,1.5229,5.7457,3.2962,1.3759,0.6165,5.7234,0.067,2.7463,1.8649,4.7491,0.234,6.1134,1.6465,2.8469,0.0226,1.4077,6.0679,4.6973,1.9107,2.0864,0.9116,1.5379,4.9695,2.3467,0.3079,2.6335,1.5739,3.2187,2.4626,1.86,2.1322,1.8074,0.9478,1.5185,1.6824,5.6499,1.2443,1.9164,0.2183,4.8461,1.2262,2.7058,0.0079,0.1969,1.1228,3.1119,0.2794,5.9044,0.1186,1.2055,1.3418,3.1661,1.3146,5.3427,0.6797,3.5575,1.2798,0.0493,0.9845,4.5477,2.0593,0.567,0.1125,0.7663,4.9983,4.2033,6.5831,0.3306,2.4099,1.154,0.1227,1.4923,3.9489,2.7218,1.0321,0.7633,1.7711,1.2097,0.2404,2.0861,1.8806,1.1109,0.9364,0.3816,1.9514,3.5907,0.6954,4.1389,0.4229]}

Still, I feel that it already represents some pretty major steps in the right direction, and with more time and a ton better art, I'm convinced it could be a huge hit.\nThe Kickstarter campaign will run through August 24th, so grab some friends and join the fun!\nA big Thank you in advance to anyone who backs the project!","token_len":196,"entropy":[9.3896,3.5942,5.1261,0.0541,0.9967,0.9143,3.4601,5.1301,1.2804,1.4006,2.5935,8.1069,0.1715,8.0622,0.0098,1.1464,1.442,4.5155,6.8419,5.6085,11.9502,0.527,1.2119,7.0789,0.6723,0.1492,2.7779,0.5958,1.8654,3.2252,3.001,3.9039,1.4626,0.3762,3.0473,8.2644,2.79,0.9673,3.3374,1.4637,6.1906,0.0578,0.5416,0.0382,0.5269,1.5044,1.174,0.4388,4.0268,2.6106,3.9436,0.8982,1.3487,1.5228,0.9916,1.8276,8.6466,0.5559,3.5032,3.0907,5.3688,2.3901,0.5897,3.3311,6.272,2.2018,3.7079,1.2444,0.7205,5.6488,3.0678,2.1816,3.6616,3.8372,1.0419,2.1054,0.8546,2.3798,2.2236,3.7625,3.9985,1.6193,0.5385,3.3139,1.4823,3.7972,1.377,1.6748,0.3888,0.8681,2.1268,3.4841,6.0468,0.7785,1.7253,2.7518,3.6135,2.0943,7.2876,2.361,1.3267,1.3484,5.8867,5.0031,0.2242,0.4994,1.9191,1.2987,0.6694,3.1385,4.9659,0.6263,2.0526,1.9343,3.1794,1.4857,4.995,4.0468,0.2207,0.4206,3.8218,1.6899,0.6539,0.4225,5.3888,0.0848,1.4674,3.7667,1.5119,1.3822,4.0538,2.085,3.6571,3.3366,5.0681,2.4192,1.6932,0.5413,0.1347,0.0119,2.004,0.5964,4.4019,2.9227,0.539,1.1765,3.7675,6.2035,5.9525,2.3699,0.9026,0.7352,1.7706,3.7516,1.6015,1.9014,1.0847,1.3531,3.1934,0.899,0.3098,0.4929,2.0661,4.2463,1.5266,1.6793,1.9959,2.8135,3.0576,3.905,0.3522,0.7096,1.9477,5.2981,2.349,1.2886,0.6191,3.0443,1.7084,1.8011,0.8008,1.2563,4.9208,2.819,4.0088,2.3081,5.3264,0.0163,0.7624,3.6805,0.3779,2.3538,1.0768,0.6886,1.0569]}
