{"id":4457,"ended":false,"length":536,"gen_text":"There is a sentence, that when uttered, provides complete knowledge of the universe to the person to say it. Occasionally, someone says it in conversation.\n\nIs it that in the sentence, it provides complete knowledge? Or\n\nis it that when uttered, it provides knowledge?\n\nThe second answer is that the first answer is not a true description of complete knowledge. What is partial knowledge really is? This is a mystery to mathematics and thus the answer to this question will not be included in this answer.\n\nHere is another example, but this time it is not complete knowledge being provided by the sentence. (For people who can read this, you have to see the answer for yourself ).\n\nSuppose a mathematician is asked : Is a number greater or less than two, greater than a number more than two, greater than a number, greater than some number?\n\nThis question can be answered in the following way : a is greater than b, b is greater than c, a is greater than d.\n\nHowever, some of the other terms.\n\nis greater than e.\n\nis greater than g.\n\nis greater than h.\n\nis greater than i.\n\nis greater than j.\n\nis greater than k,\n\nis greater than l, which is greater than m.\n\nis greater than n, which is greater than o.\n\nwhich is greater than p,\n\nis greater than q.\n\nis greater than r, which is greater than s.\n\nis greater than t, which is greater than u.\n\nis greater than v, which is greater than w, which is greater than the term.\n\nIs this a complete description of knowledge provided by the sentence?\n\nCan anyone say the sentence? If they cannot, I am glad that they cannot do mathematics. They might even be able to tell you how to prove for sure the answer will not be correct. The only thing that makes this answer correct is that when you are given the statement, you can know the correct answer.\n\nThis means, if you want to know the absolute truth, then the question is :\n\nQuestion: Is a number greater or less than two, greater than a number more than two, greater than a number, greater than some number?\n\nWhat is meant is that if you ask, if the number is greater, the answer to your question is. Thus the question can be solved in one step. The statement, that is true, provides a solution to the question. The answer, that is obtained by stating the statement, is found by saying, that is false, then the answer is again obtained by saying, that is true.\n\nIt all seems logical to me.

{"id":192,"ended":true,"length":573,"gen_text":"Pick your poison - write about the day of an addict... or the day in the newspaper when somebody died on the street.\n\nThe more people you can make talk about it, the more you will be able to write about it, the stronger you will be.\n\nRemember that you are not competing with the addict. You are not competing with the junkies.\n\nYou are competing with yourself.\n\nI'm not competing with my family.\n\nI'm not competing with my friends.\n\nI'm not competing with anyone.\n\nAll I know is that for years I have been the guy with a needle in my hand. If you want your family member to know what a monster you are, you must talk to them about what makes you feel so worthless and worthless, why you use drugs, and what it feels like to hurt.\n\nI can never again live a normal life without telling my story. Sometimes things can happen very unexpectedly, and you have to let yourself believe that things can change for the good. This is not to say that I hope to cure myself. But I know that when things are very bad I can use drugs to help me through the bad times, and I also know that when things are very good I can use them as a way to celebrate life. My drugs don't provide me with answers, but I think answers could be found in my story. When people see that I have lived without drugs for three years and look at me, they will notice that my problems are resolved, that the bad days are behind me, and that I look the way I used to. That is their job - to tell me that I'm still able to pull myself together.\n\nI don't think I have to convince anyone that my life is worth living. I don't have to convince those who believe the lies I tell them about the addict who just needs a home. I can only show those who don't understand, who don't believe that using drugs is a choice; those who don't believe that when one starts they must lose the things that bring them joy; and those who do not understand that they do not have to be dependent on drugs to live a happy life.\n\nIt is all about the people you choose to be with.\n\nIf you want to move on with your life and to live with some kind of meaning, I'm with you. If you don't want to help the addict or the homeless because you don't want to live like them.

{"id":3591,"ended":true,"length":573,"gen_text":"Pick your poison - write about the day of an addict... or the day in the newspaper when somebody died on the street.\n\nThe more people you can make talk about it, the more you will be able to write about it, the stronger you will be.\n\nRemember that you are not competing with the addict. You are not competing with the junkies.\n\nYou are competing with yourself.\n\nI'm not competing with my family.\n\nI'm not competing with my friends.\n\nI'm not competing with anyone.\n\nAll I know is that for years I have been the guy with a needle in my hand. If you want your family member to know what a monster you are, you must talk to them about what makes you feel so worthless and worthless, why you use drugs, and what it feels like to hurt.\n\nI can never again live a normal life without telling my story. Sometimes things can happen very unexpectedly, and you have to let yourself believe that things can change for the good. This is not to say that I hope to cure myself. But I know that when things are very bad I can use drugs to help me through the bad times, and I also know that when things are very good I can use them as a way to celebrate life. My drugs don't provide me with answers, but I think answers could be found in my story. When people see that I have lived without drugs for three years and look at me, they will notice that my problems are resolved, that the bad days are behind me, and that I look the way I used to. That is their job - to tell me that I'm still able to pull myself together.\n\nI don't think I have to convince anyone that my life is worth living. I don't have to convince those who believe the lies I tell them about the addict who just needs a home. I can only show those who don't understand, who don't believe that using drugs is a choice; those who don't believe that when one starts they must lose the things that bring them joy; and those who do not understand that they do not have to be dependent on drugs to live a happy life.\n\nIt is all about the people you choose to be with.\n\nIf you want to move on with your life and to live with some kind of meaning, I'm with you. If you don't want to help the addict or the homeless because you don't want to live like them.

RiffTrax: \"This could have been an entirely different movie\" has this as the premise.\n\nTheatre\n\nAn example from The Marriage Plot occurs in The Cottage where Mr. Van Brunt discovers his wife is in love with another man after being married to Mrs. Van Brunt for twenty years and the two have been dating for three. He then has to choose between ending his marriage or the fact that he fell for his wife's man.\n\nOlder Than Steam: In a play by George Bernard Shaw, the narrator was an old woman who was married to her husband from a young age, despite what anyone else might have told her. Later in the play, after she had been divorced twice, during the second divorce, she meets a man, Tom Tregenza, at a tea party who's not as nice as the real Tom Tregenza, but she sees that he is very loving, caring, and the sort of man who would love her. The narrator believes (rightly, as it turns out) that the man she loves is just an imaginary construct she conjured up to make herself feel better; but the other members of the group start to accuse her of being as bad, or worse, a liar. What she did to him will only become clear once she explains that the reason she broke up with him, and only then by taking the real Tom Tregenza, is because she had fallen in love with the real Tom Tregenza.\n\nVideo Games\n\nVisual Novels\n\nIn the Ace Attorney Investigations title The Mysteries of the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, the protagonist will sometimes sleep with the other members of the case and claim it was only a one-night stand. This will lead to the group trying to prove her innocent; at some point she'll admit to having had a sexual relationship with several of the jurors at the trial. This isn't necessarily true, since the original trial, with the full court, including the new member, is just one night and the defendant wasn't present and can't have slept with the other members. However, if the other members want to pin the blame on her, they can point her towards who, in their mind, would have had the advantage of someone to sleep with that night and then out her if it's found that there was no actual wrongdoing.\n\nWebcomics\n\nWeb Original\n\nOne of the \"fictional\" heroes in Whateley Universe (who isn't named) fell for a prostitute on their \"dates\" several times, and was forced to do a good deed for her, despite being promised she would get better with a new love interest.\n\nWestern Animation\n\nReal Life","token_len":601,"entropy":[5.251,10.0935,4.7241,6.4359,4.3125,0.9303,5.0559,1.6577,6.6318,2.6828,6.5769,5.3327,1.0435,0.8956,5.0809,1.3596,0.1331,5.4596,1.084,3.6287,0.5248,3.2031,1.7029,4.3002,4.7339,0.3874,1.1394,0.0082,7.9236,10.5072,0.2963,0.321,0.0051,0.0129,0.0133,0.0065,0.0015,0.0008,0.0059,0.0008,0.0008,0.0017,0.0017,0.0007,0.0004,0.0005,0.0008,6.6273,3.6534,0.9422,0.0018,1.6605,2.7679,5.5899,5.686,1.9132,0.7744,3.4861,4.6324,0.0763,0.8732,2.1786,3.7284,4.2341,1.261,1.117,3.5775,0.6855,0.6708,0.0003,2.2392,4.2354,0.007,0.0003,4.8282,3.5292,0.6488,2.109,5.2926,2.5472,4.7409,0.5594,2.3523,5.3639,2.3069,4.2279,4.6172,0.219,5.7873,2.4934,0.0139,5.3311,1.8337,0.6205,1.7968,3.3635,0.6043,0.0105,1.9781,0.0226,4.3599,3.889,2.6988,1.0581,3.8256,0.0268,0.083,0.0096,0.0002,0.1309,2.6297,0.4483,3.2157,4.1235,1.9188,1.9076,1.5564,5.9977,0.2399,2.5195,1.4265,2.1183,3.6461,3.7295,1.0123,2.6392,0.3575,5.8192,1.0725,0.3925,1.0944,4.3929,5.4279,0.1541,0.9131,5.2518,1.7381,1.4855,0.4076,1.1122,3.5029,0.4954,0.6182,0.0002,3.9327,0.8597,0.0011,0.7617,0.1256,1.9561,3.5579,1.9098,0.9424,3.2962,0.7804,0.0001,0.5799,1.9914,3.3227,5.7003,3.6064,2.411,3.2311,0.5047,2.2697,3.1778,0.5679,2.1482,1.2951,5.3387,2.0299,1.1456,0.0083,1.6606,4.886,5.576,4.7367,0.6337,2.0275,1.4613,1.9447,0.0323,0.2915,5.1965,1.2391,0.3126,0.2088,0.2563,3.1071,1.7794,2.2291,1.9684,2.9147,2.9127,0.4512,7.4835,1.9018,2.2301,0.6777,1.2782,0.6063,4.1077,0.863,0.9069,2.4556,5.3855,6.093,5.5538,2.5978,0.1518,4.4007,0.3366,4.1201,0.3264,2.5639,4.3465,4.2272,3.9696,3.2001,0.4108,2.4599,6.1042,0.5055,1.4715,0.0013,0.0001,0.9917,0.941,1.6478,5.2785,1.8891,0.4829,2.5199,4.1543,4.7581,1.993,3.8511,0.4819,0.3232,5.2452,3.4022,0.0855,0.6268,1.7892,0.9816,3.0233,0.2084,1.1345,2.93,1.5629,5.2103,6.0348,3.437,0.1047,1.5907,1.4347,0.1448,0.5562,0.0004,0.0392,0.0292,2.9497,1.8089,0.9931,2.6438,0.7401,3.8431,3.5304,4.2625,2.928,3.2836,4.8107,0.0527,0.1455,0.9127,1.9007,0.8912,0.1875,0.2057,4.9217,2.408,2.8695,4.1162,4.188,0.0089,0.1711,3.2095,5.4941,0.4893,6.547,0.1045,0.1469,1.1355,6.2198,2.4507,3.9518,1.108,0.3869,0.1181,3.2355,2.5079,1.57,5.3783,2.3971,3.8654,1.8022,3.792,4.5843,4.8563,2.6214,0.4887,2.7161,0.9182,4.7377,2.5849,2.336,3.1726,0.2457,4.9587,0.3747,0.042,0.5724,3.3729,1.7933,4.5783,1.7043,5.2159,4.6724,2.13,3.4429,0.2368,0.6737,0.0006,0.0001,3.1746,1.7351,1.0762,0.7671,2.758,2.5053,0.3212,0.0027,0.0782,2.339,2.8734,0.0573,0.0398,0.0007,0.0,0.9049,0.7837,0.0002,1.0946,0.0045,0.014,0.0003,1.2382,0.0006,0.0217,0.0205,0.0003,1.4232,1.9556,2.8177,0.0013,2.7915,5.0407,3.9979,5.1571,0.1207,1.417,2.7991,0.0318,0.2341,0.0015,0.0012,1.3397,1.8687,2.053,4.9434,3.9404,5.2474,1.3297,1.6245,3.3919,3.4477,0.019,0.5104,3.7621,4.1089,5.1101,2.1912,1.1468,4.2861,1.0703,2.7624,0.2311,0.5773,0.1758,0.3438,2.3767,3.1477,2.4644,0.2218,1.8304,4.4065,4.5108,0.0253,2.1641,3.4858,1.6563,5.4536,4.263,4.2188,0.2462,2.9743,1.1209,3.4028,1.5183,2.028,2.4423,1.6077,2.3872,0.1513,0.1013,4.3395,1.5879,0.5693,5.5764,4.1702,0.9707,0.5146,1.2516,3.2074,4.5122,0.0004,3.2146,2.9137,0.652,2.6398,1.5069,5.7543,2.3576,4.5055,3.6064,1.3056,5.1375,4.4804,1.9899,4.2773,0.8119,5.2456,4.8192,0.8566,2.2518,4.9822,2.5816,1.7792,2.9288,1.4952,4.4477,4.0744,0.0002,0.8943,4.38,4.1719,0.2032,2.2286,2.3706,0.061,1.6221,1.1068,1.1381,1.0076,2.4954,0.0584,2.8309,0.9183,2.9201,0.5541,5.5088,0.1684,4.7867,1.1568,2.1705,0.1929,1.3022,0.4865,0.9748,1.2875,2.3442,6.5721,2.768,7.1695,4.9796,1.4317,1.0084,1.915,0.0463,2.5246,0.6768,1.79,1.1657,3.7175,2.3349,5.7535,5.5364,0.7239,0.0124,3.5217,0.183,3.1872,3.1111,5.6959,2.7974,4.5102,2.3874,2.5146,2.7083,1.8047,4.6115,0.6851,0.6701,4.6902,5.0905,0.35,0.6495,0.0003,0.799,1.7547,0.0032,0.0197,0.0003,0.7704,0.0531,0.0661,0.0003,5.5777,0.5985,0.1777,3.9042,5.1275,1.9696,0.4338,5.3069,1.0231,5.5549,0.0216,0.0003,0.0036,4.1144,3.0049,4.5251,0.0003,4.1108,1.256,5.0977,1.353,1.1767,5.1817,4.3745,3.444,6.3999,3.9489,0.6907,6.1793,0.3789,1.4987,1.4331,3.038,4.201,0.1297,4.3747,3.3071,4.2174,0.4769,0.7246,1.007,3.6272,3.9835,2.2166,5.6114,2.4684,1.7014,1.9484,4.885,2.5485,4.0327,3.0124,3.9538,0.0564,0.5432,0.9141,0.0002,0.9056,0.0013,0.8083,0.0002,0.2926,0.0028]}

All he could say was, `` My name is Johnny Cash. '' How do you feel when you read that message?\"\n\nThe question, and the answer, were printed on tic- tac-toe boards in four colors. The first board was red. On the second board was white. On the third board was blue. On the fourth board was black.\n\nYou were playing the game of tic-tac-toe with a friend. The first player asked you another player to repeat the question three times. The second player asked you three times. Then your friend, who was the first player, asked you three times. What did you say? A few months later, you were standing on the other side of a glass wall. Your friend said in a loud voice, `` A little further from here, a little farther, I won't have to ask three times.'' What did you say? A few months later, you were standing on the other side of a glass wall.

Your sister isn 't sure what that particular quality is, but she likes it.

{"id":2085,"ended":false,"length":564,"gen_text":"When you die, a television appears and plays the life of the person who cares for you the most in the world in front of you. After you die, the person you bullied in high school's life plays in front of you.\n\n\"It was terrifying for me to walk in on these actors pretending to be me because nobody could play me as accurately as the real me.\n\n\"I'd be walking down the street and suddenly I'd see people running up to me and hug me saying, 'I'm sure you're doing so well. How are you doing?'\n\n\"It was so surreal that people were actually showing up in the street to hug me. The amount of fear that I felt was more than I could ever imagine.\n\n\"I had nightmares where I was walking down a street and the whole world was ending around me.\"\n\nWhen asked what she did after the abuse, she said: \"I just thought about myself.\n\n\"It can't change who your parents are and who you are, but it does change who you are in a very big way.\n\n\"My mum got on with her life. She's a very, very good person.\n\n\"She's so confident and she loves her family very much. She's so tough and she was able to get on with her life even though she didn't feel comfortable in her own skin for most of her life.\n\n\"The other thing is that I think she just accepts it without any judgement and just says, 'well my life's the same so it doesn't matter', even though she always loved me and she knew that I had problems but she didn't let them affect her life because of that.\n\n\"But it affected me and caused me problems in other ways.\n\n\"It makes you feel so low and I know my mum is not a saint in the least.\n\n\"It didn't help that she was always being treated badly.\n\n\"It felt horrible when she was called a slut over a haircut she did out of spite but she's so strong with her sense of self and her ability to get on with people.\n\n\"She's had some difficult times over the years and I know her mental health is constantly under stress, especially after what happened with me.\n\n\"I wish you could all be friends.\n\n\"You just try and cope with what's going on by yourself.\n\n\"It's terrible the way we treat people but I just think about my mum, about all of these people who live with these mental health, sexual issues.\n\n\"So it's not just me. Many of the characters in these shows have mental illnes that need real help and understanding.\n\n\"I just think about all my fellow show-watchers and I just want to say that they need support and that there's much more out there and it's never too late to talk about things.\"","token_len":603,"entropy":[1.9996,6.1241,0.5634,4.0271,11.1135,4.6411,2.3644,2.0211,2.0228,5.3343,1.0813,1.1086,0.9541,1.0325,9.8661,0.6895,0.0338,5.3678,0.0692,4.2276,1.131,1.3162,5.6346,2.2703,0.0056,0.3391,0.3377,4.5649,2.1697,0.763,0.139,1.6135,2.9873,1.6478,13.0975,3.1303,1.1674,0.0362,6.5552,1.9855,1.9365,2.0256,0.2269,0.0037,0.2805,0.6401,1.8041,0.0074,2.947,3.1913,2.4316,5.0719,3.8182,0.4065,1.3988,5.6026,2.0799,3.5198,4.7875,5.1348,5.4061,0.0447,0.1819,0.4749,4.5218,6.0739,2.7918,5.5868,0.7521,2.7522,3.2981,0.1403,2.6384,3.2077,0.2019,1.1135,2.712,0.0002,0.0896,1.1893,4.0166,2.3869,3.1223,1.2418,0.0723,0.3394,0.5595,3.5668,1.1648,0.1969,1.0605,3.4175,3.6869,1.9072,0.2572,0.7894,0.9875,4.3217,0.0597,4.3484,0.837,0.0263,1.0578,0.8871,6.4651,0.5292,0.6241,3.8681,3.2944,0.5588,2.4306,3.5098,0.2496,0.0277,1.5745,0.5475,0.876,0.0002,0.0735,1.723,0.6013,2.5463,2.6859,2.8719,2.4671,1.4505,2.5783,4.8839,1.6861,2.6834,2.4088,1.3534,1.1013,1.6356,0.0983,1.0906,4.2371,4.9647,0.0055,5.2833,1.7574,0.8995,0.9472,1.263,5.1043,0.3531,0.3918,1.0258,1.5092,1.4602,1.1878,0.612,0.0002,0.0634,1.0227,2.9891,3.6194,2.9058,0.3036,0.6876,2.8062,0.5086,3.0109,0.6808,0.5395,3.4465,3.4566,0.795,0.5336,5.2843,2.3838,0.0051,1.8027,0.0685,0.0002,4.2428,3.7518,1.7747,1.9215,4.1045,2.2512,1.4111,3.625,0.7404,1.1716,0.5596,0.2353,0.0093,0.3646,2.6261,3.7703,1.6784,3.3748,1.0093,1.7295,0.0002,0.0413,2.9462,6.4815,1.7855,4.9125,0.9741,7.2363,2.7911,0.0972,2.9049,1.8118,0.526,0.3915,1.6218,0.3967,0.9783,2.4421,1.0555,1.2485,0.4418,0.5901,2.0972,2.5232,2.671,3.5929,0.0883,0.3673,0.3413,0.0002,0.0402,3.8113,3.0951,5.3226,3.287,1.1327,1.2465,0.145,2.0421,0.9578,1.9354,1.1846,1.9679,4.7473,0.0044,2.9387,1.5594,0.8983,1.3131,0.0002,0.0334,1.3202,1.0494,4.2528,5.6563,1.1566,2.1509,4.5079,1.2507,1.976,2.7751,0.0645,0.4295,1.4876,0.8796,3.3516,5.4467,1.2286,1.2614,4.1967,2.0167,0.0035,2.0214,0.5639,0.0531,0.5592,0.0954,5.3232,0.3763,0.7446,3.8644,0.0003,2.7268,2.7451,2.1357,1.2404,0.1826,0.0353,2.2408,5.0463,0.0056,0.3125,0.1509,0.5722,0.0748,0.0002,0.0398,3.7655,3.546,0.8839,1.1628,0.7095,1.2484,3.3629,2.957,3.7091,4.9332,1.7993,6.4287,2.1124,2.7516,2.106,2.5606,3.2155,0.453,0.0454,4.7135,5.7812,2.6182,1.7992,4.4643,1.3858,4.6002,1.8067,1.8201,0.0003,0.7694,4.8338,3.5433,0.1158,1.292,5.8096,4.8372,0.2401,1.6793,2.2578,3.5277,2.123,0.3729,2.7624,2.7256,2.851,0.3805,1.9609,0.0002,2.8685,2.209,1.7625,0.3838,1.6993,4.0289,2.8739,2.4871,0.69,0.0631,0.0002,0.0483,3.4682,2.4043,3.5914,1.4118,2.1172,5.8638,0.4123,3.7326,2.7567,3.8865,0.2478,0.8302,0.7292,0.0002,0.0327,1.867,5.0517,0.8057,1.4011,2.4806,3.805,0.8822,4.4857,4.3469,4.0072,0.5927,2.9413,3.3174,2.6274,2.0609,4.2236,2.3199,2.8006,1.3666,0.8973,0.0002,0.029,3.6299,4.7156,0.0001,2.1526,0.8289,1.5361,1.3579,2.796,4.3398,3.2784,1.6296,2.0208,0.8021,0.0002,0.0245,2.5701,5.2219,4.8685,2.3845,1.2819,1.3759,3.9626,1.1262,3.0857,7.1966,2.5231,5.2199,2.8826,2.1639,6.9659,0.0519,2.7383,4.6864,1.4764,2.4337,2.6245,1.0645,6.8794,0.8891,2.7254,0.0036,2.0552,1.1186,2.2575,3.8766,0.0296,2.7014,0.1952,0.0989,5.1161,0.7417,0.1098,0.0002,0.0271,1.0035,0.9894,4.6613,3.5502,3.7078,0.627,4.0688,0.0597,0.2508,1.843,1.6985,1.46,3.944,4.9084,0.2272,1.4837,5.5095,1.4404,2.2209,2.092,3.7794,2.6121,2.7324,0.3852,2.1277,1.0498,0.8846,0.1148,0.0002,0.0268,1.8522,4.8102,6.1388,0.3452,3.5635,2.6588,6.2963,2.9478,1.5314,0.0002,0.034,2.8948,4.8522,5.7015,1.2007,4.5378,0.9994,2.2777,1.3859,1.1828,0.0232,4.0728,1.1381,1.0374,0.6565,0.0002,0.022,1.9448,0.4774,4.9783,5.0522,0.5369,3.9273,2.2729,2.3537,3.5575,1.553,2.3715,2.6037,2.5325,2.058,0.1585,3.0027,3.9433,2.669,2.1392,3.3078,0.7169,0.7577,5.0889,1.3603,2.8396,3.8622,0.4185,8.7546,4.3257,3.8892,2.0785,0.1785,0.0002,0.0256,5.1426,3.6159,0.5232,2.1898,1.0665,0.548,1.2031,6.7743,1.8199,1.9753,5.7137,1.0504,2.8606,1.2809,2.6252,1.7264,6.8071,3.4998,4.4534,4.9061,5.7456,0.976,1.4044,4.0821,0.7966,0.1396,0.0002,0.0351,1.2075,2.1154,2.2623,1.0841,1.5811,4.7529,4.4462,5.097,1.149,2.868,0.0002,1.1702,2.2679,1.8734,1.0845,1.2279,0.9879,1.7882,2.5501,1.9799,2.8988,1.1866,2.2096,3.096,1.0375,6.1069,0.5858,3.0215,0.004,3.5099,2.2389,0.4162,4.6498,0.1805,0.0066,0.5264,4.4728,0.7472,4.3946,1.2974]}
{"id":2367,"ended":true,"length":580,"gen_text":"Every morning you wake up and your house is full of geese. Hundreds of geese and zero explanations. You've learned to live with it but last night you brought someone home from a bar and in your drunken state never got around to explaining what they would wake up to. \"\n\nIt was in the year 2000 that I first learned the word \"Geese\" in response to this conversation with a friend. That was the year that I realized how difficult it was to actually talk about the subject on the record.\n\nI was at my parents' home and had just finished my first ever record in NYC. Being a music producer at the time I spent the majority of my time in the studio recording music that I personally wanted to hear. When it came to my music the label and I had never really thought about it as a \"geese\" kind of label. Yet through an online exchange with a friend I asked what \"geese\" meant and I was told it meant \"the person with the biggest ego.\" In other words, when your label is thinking and working with what they consider to be the most talented person they can get your mind might get blown and things can get very messy.\n\nWhile I found that the term in any definition was really a metaphor for me and my emotions I was still not comfortable using the term in my own context (being an actor\/musician) where the name came from. When I finally sat down and crafted a definition for the label it seemed to fit the current \"geese-like\" nature of the music business. I found that my friend's definition for \"geese\" also stuck and when that was out there I took advantage of that and adopted it into the name for the label. It was that label that started the line that would eventually give birth to my previous two studios: One Recordings, and EMI Records. I feel that I owe my success to the support of the very label which was used to promote me that my record didn't sell. No one's career is built upon the label's failure.\n\nSo over the last two decades I've been fortunate enough to work with some of the most inspiring minds in music. For me the people who I work with are a part of what makes me the human being I am. They are some of the most talented individuals and I make sure I am appreciative of the people who help shape my music. The one thing we all have is the one common element: we are musicians who love music. We strive every day to make it better but we can only do so if we share our work. I'm proud to say that I don't always think I get it right, but this is because I'm trying my best. What does this say to you that I have never had a song that I didn't like? If you believe me when I tell you that I like every song we've ever recorded it also says there's much more out there.","token_len":603,"entropy":[4.7806,4.4177,1.9633,0.0602,1.3513,3.8133,6.6125,0.497,2.6718,0.0277,10.6273,0.1663,1.3431,8.8793,0.2959,0.8541,0.0001,3.7441,9.0854,13.0962,0.6593,2.6268,3.795,5.1489,0.9146,2.088,0.1069,0.9292,3.5353,8.5139,0.4529,1.4536,6.8977,6.2693,1.4018,2.0937,2.1489,2.9876,1.118,5.7765,2.3309,1.3246,1.6139,7.9975,3.5277,2.2556,0.0063,2.3223,2.5742,4.0517,5.1872,7.9055,0.092,0.1465,0.5775,5.1206,3.3424,0.0184,4.2909,1.9809,4.5816,1.5007,6.0003,1.7728,0.7438,2.1924,1.7503,3.409,2.1461,2.5868,0.7277,2.9797,0.1301,1.171,2.0601,6.0445,0.0088,3.042,4.8828,2.3797,0.912,0.9346,0.5582,4.6513,1.7317,0.8445,0.6395,1.5518,0.9922,3.877,3.0395,4.8284,0.3365,0.8581,0.1875,5.0292,3.1333,0.4564,2.2157,3.4509,5.2507,1.6754,2.9941,0.4659,2.468,0.0002,2.0312,2.2482,3.7764,2.8342,3.1019,0.6619,3.3447,2.7055,3.5389,1.3774,1.5019,3.3108,1.4272,3.9734,3.4496,3.566,5.7114,0.618,5.944,1.4772,4.3962,3.6844,2.8954,0.1885,0.0143,1.6044,4.6294,2.0076,1.364,0.0021,0.4802,0.345,1.7433,0.9776,0.3112,3.2602,2.8485,3.5059,1.0461,5.9364,1.4679,0.0643,0.7138,0.3634,3.7974,2.6246,0.153,0.8694,2.949,4.2614,4.1869,3.5349,2.8265,2.3904,1.9445,3.897,1.2279,3.4837,0.4624,2.986,1.9614,0.874,3.0125,3.5734,0.0241,0.5571,4.8166,0.0019,6.114,0.3425,6.2912,6.0001,4.5689,4.9982,4.6007,0.9574,0.7138,0.3512,0.9775,5.5445,2.5156,2.9005,0.8981,0.0054,0.0282,0.3152,1.0548,2.9122,0.7643,1.4958,1.8136,1.5141,0.7812,3.8984,5.3951,4.3647,0.8202,3.6791,1.747,1.1207,4.5241,2.1491,0.0073,0.6915,4.403,4.9173,2.4201,2.568,4.5989,5.9184,3.8398,1.5265,4.9411,0.8196,2.1246,0.9633,0.008,0.4904,2.1697,0.6681,2.0095,2.836,1.3654,2.2272,2.9547,2.8067,4.4057,2.3538,2.095,2.5375,5.9795,2.4167,0.528,3.1843,3.183,0.3523,0.7024,0.0002,5.0324,1.3837,5.7214,2.0822,2.9536,1.5288,5.7041,6.2468,5.9903,1.0463,4.9952,3.2393,4.664,0.553,3.4299,2.3767,0.5412,5.7062,1.7029,1.8739,1.3299,2.7113,2.1528,2.0825,1.5827,0.701,1.7549,1.7093,2.1351,4.9735,5.7538,4.2371,2.8404,6.3048,3.3245,1.8277,0.0106,1.2509,5.1433,1.8047,5.0843,5.4231,1.3169,0.3729,4.0603,0.5887,2.7246,4.2026,0.0575,0.8841,6.1418,1.4628,3.7971,0.9743,0.6246,2.0563,2.2982,3.6312,0.984,1.0415,2.2999,5.5896,5.8745,1.0472,0.0041,4.3619,2.9177,0.11,2.3801,0.2169,0.495,2.8016,6.3399,1.1858,2.124,4.7192,0.8483,4.1577,2.2756,1.6533,1.4539,3.0257,0.9793,0.1207,0.0018,0.0507,3.596,6.1523,2.0756,3.6227,5.2263,1.6294,4.8137,1.5408,0.8651,4.9432,3.5619,0.0737,2.9328,1.6546,4.4798,0.607,2.2158,1.0481,1.2339,2.6521,0.5773,0.2747,0.2129,3.0789,1.033,4.2429,5.0212,0.8391,3.4014,1.1679,4.906,3.3765,2.1933,1.4148,4.7376,0.7091,0.0133,3.5548,6.2879,4.4239,6.0346,2.0812,5.1776,4.7989,0.0554,2.5703,1.2961,5.2399,2.8473,2.5388,0.178,3.692,4.4908,1.1418,3.1959,2.3001,2.5824,1.6791,0.4627,1.061,4.7059,0.7168,1.7976,6.2882,2.1757,4.8076,2.8599,5.3547,0.6144,4.2868,1.5692,4.8301,5.2965,4.2997,4.5257,0.0005,1.1971,1.4214,6.4181,1.2612,4.9398,4.8136,0.678,3.308,4.1961,2.3258,4.1702,1.8567,3.8073,0.6266,0.6379,0.0002,3.3559,5.65,0.1719,2.1251,3.6437,0.8077,0.9247,0.4587,1.7757,2.5194,0.5246,0.0222,1.4611,0.2279,0.871,0.8748,0.0554,0.7988,4.6051,5.6086,0.4486,1.0922,0.9318,4.9079,1.6328,1.9035,4.4359,1.6492,2.517,2.3388,0.0643,0.879,3.2155,2.8335,0.0016,3.2692,0.8725,1.0455,2.5593,5.2379,1.3712,0.675,0.0232,0.5172,2.1504,0.969,4.7745,0.0073,0.2534,0.5755,1.5458,3.0605,3.7704,1.9614,5.8713,2.0764,2.4265,3.4195,5.643,0.0445,0.194,2.2149,3.0275,0.9249,2.3132,3.4488,0.9403,2.2945,0.8668,3.2356,5.216,0.7684,4.6347,0.9517,0.4987,4.2941,1.5073,5.9409,3.506,3.096,2.5011,2.9336,1.2886,3.9532,3.885,1.9492,0.9452,0.4176,2.6958,5.3335,3.7161,0.0959,0.0796,1.3314,2.7476,0.3645,5.1268,1.6623,2.6644,1.3994,0.3453,1.0825,2.0485,0.1383,3.8915,1.3583,3.311,1.7221,2.2463,2.633,2.4658,0.5549,0.9482,0.1988,1.4975,4.8479,0.0006,4.3069,3.8775,2.6571,4.0391,0.6692,0.0921,2.1364,0.4484,6.0783,0.8072,3.0578,0.2851,1.9298,3.795,1.9968,0.6035,1.6008,5.5427,4.2481,1.6697,2.7247,2.5961,0.3262,5.3842,0.9765,3.025,3.4044,2.4103,1.1244,3.6396,1.7467,1.0026,2.0132,0.0004,0.8394,0.5625,3.9912,0.8846,5.501,4.8164,2.818,0.0291,1.3487,0.0048,0.6464,1.5253,4.7441,3.7681,0.3442,4.5745,1.1527,0.4913,1.4193,2.9366,4.8134,1.3963,4.9867,1.0902,5.0971,0.3853,3.5463,0.0029,1.6488]}
{"id":4449,"ended":false,"length":553,"gen_text":"You've been skyping regularly with a new internet friend when you slowly begin to realize that the city in the background of the video call is not of this earth... your'space' that you inhabit is really just your pocket. The other person, who's voice you can make out, is also real and is wearing a 'wink' tattooed across their cheek. The other'sock' is actually your internet phone.\n\n\nYour friends and family say the 'weird' things they have been saying, and you have no idea that they're actually watching you in the background... or that you're getting off with two other people in your space right this very second.\n\n\nIt's a weird way to spend the afternoon with your best friend, but... it's your space now.\n\n\n*You're already feeling self-conscious, so you keep typing like you're in an awkward conversation, but it's really your mouth, your mind, your'space' that are all real.\n\n\nYou have your own identity, and you have some of the other person's thoughts and feelings too, but not in any way you'd recognize or feel. You can have a conversation, share memories, and enjoy each other's company (without doing anything else!)\n\n\nYou are now one of the 'weird people' playing the rest of the people in your internet life.\n\n\n*You are finally ready to call it quits on your secret life... but before you do, you log on to your favourite website. The video game you've always thought you played with your friend gets played like a real-time web-game, as you both try to make each other, and the internet play a part in this.\n\n\nYour internet 'friends' start playing an online game, a little like 'The Lord of the Rings: Game of Thrones'. The rules of the online game are different for you than they are for them; for example, you will not be allowed to be in the game where the other person can move freely through it.\n\n\nOne by one, the people who have been online with you over the past few weeks join you at one of the locations the internet calls home. The game starts off like any other real-time game of real-time, but after a while you realize that you are truly playing one of the games written by real people and played by real people on the internet.\n\n\nEven though you now know who you are, you can't bring yourself to call it 'life, it's too weird.'\n\n\nYou finally get to make a last online friend, then play the game together.\n\n\nYou are really happy to see that, even without the video chat service, even when you are playing online with all of these other 'wigs' (actually there's only your own fake face at this point; the real you won't have any of this cool gear until later in your new fantasy life)","token_len":603,"entropy":[3.4679,2.4379,9.5237,3.6897,0.5836,8.185,0.7487,2.8613,3.1898,8.1427,1.3224,6.8271,1.3461,9.7457,4.1923,0.0859,2.1605,0.7699,2.8771,9.4639,3.9384,2.6301,2.2922,1.7905,1.5223,1.851,8.0722,0.7464,1.8821,6.3422,2.7681,2.1273,4.415,5.9125,10.2709,12.1056,8.1412,6.9158,0.7816,8.4739,2.2197,5.026,2.4846,3.8236,6.2144,2.2457,2.6215,4.6387,1.1022,2.8397,1.9733,3.0239,2.5661,0.7911,1.6623,5.0957,0.0026,1.2275,0.6984,4.1324,4.4837,2.1233,2.3284,5.0812,0.6252,6.0973,5.4932,4.9462,0.8336,5.0234,2.8019,1.9945,1.9179,2.7681,0.417,2.5962,4.1072,4.9854,9.0257,6.0544,1.4989,2.5883,2.5265,4.8351,4.0768,1.566,3.2672,0.0002,3.5815,3.7067,3.6923,1.1518,5.095,3.4835,3.7541,4.1249,0.1259,0.9006,2.2281,2.5681,4.0658,2.6206,0.7738,2.6622,1.726,1.0682,2.8643,2.0682,0.4594,4.0785,1.2974,1.8352,1.9045,5.3498,0.5722,3.3209,1.4097,1.4234,3.7821,3.1034,0.9887,1.3595,0.7889,5.672,3.8218,2.7341,5.6736,2.7445,1.088,2.3229,1.9929,5.8167,4.882,4.6404,1.0399,0.636,0.2869,0.8166,0.0003,3.5114,0.6018,1.9389,3.7054,4.4484,0.1315,1.526,2.2588,2.8819,5.452,0.9365,3.1428,0.2952,0.8488,0.5115,4.8624,2.013,0.3725,2.6663,3.4527,3.2991,0.5104,1.1458,0.0002,3.7675,4.9816,2.337,5.926,3.602,4.9605,0.6276,0.0178,2.3674,2.3265,0.9777,4.146,5.067,5.4064,0.7484,0.97,2.6024,2.9914,3.1846,1.9268,2.1739,1.9976,2.3393,0.6416,2.2575,4.1653,6.2283,2.9441,3.0533,4.0093,0.4295,1.0871,10.0064,0.1446,1.8015,0.9077,2.6927,2.3369,4.7305,0.5329,0.984,0.0002,3.1212,3.2694,3.9866,1.1261,5.1061,1.0293,1.1897,1.2482,2.3673,4.7935,3.6622,0.7763,4.2937,1.3682,0.0444,2.2724,1.427,0.5254,2.8476,1.5796,1.1846,4.1223,4.0103,3.3645,0.7021,1.6281,2.8379,1.894,3.314,4.211,1.6492,1.743,2.5133,4.8133,1.6875,0.9051,3.0446,4.7071,4.2042,0.3104,1.3309,5.1498,2.9654,0.4172,0.0629,0.0316,5.5695,4.2541,5.7858,0.7864,3.4158,3.951,1.1542,0.0002,1.7055,2.9165,2.9292,4.3139,0.9358,1.3549,2.9058,1.2771,0.0144,2.2817,0.4042,7.1987,2.581,6.4769,0.0054,0.6877,3.9604,0.8227,0.5751,5.1008,4.1469,0.6711,0.8321,0.0002,1.6663,1.0384,2.6807,5.436,3.398,0.1225,3.9557,1.0739,0.6956,0.0011,3.6908,0.8735,5.8272,1.8082,2.8337,1.6631,2.7164,0.0606,0.4727,0.1828,0.2361,4.998,1.6753,0.2533,0.7026,4.6773,2.5188,2.5637,3.4416,4.1939,3.2757,0.8792,0.9803,2.9114,5.3433,1.5448,4.5064,3.5441,0.5643,1.8395,6.086,3.6957,6.0618,1.5761,2.3263,2.5314,0.9846,5.0714,2.3931,0.5812,1.2274,4.0417,0.9021,4.3283,3.3999,0.1206,3.7235,2.6444,0.0897,6.1244,0.7608,0.789,3.1257,5.3323,3.1134,2.4859,0.1827,2.8444,1.3262,0.6368,0.0002,3.1433,2.692,4.3815,0.5696,0.0372,4.2042,2.8256,4.5924,0.8008,0.523,1.8122,5.0693,4.8584,1.0822,3.2949,3.7279,5.4363,0.0771,0.0911,0.047,2.4076,5.4268,0.037,0.3566,1.8729,2.8144,3.9224,1.5032,0.3871,4.5372,0.1222,0.2917,2.9763,3.0645,2.1813,2.8659,0.8804,0.3257,0.024,1.2868,4.4832,3.2044,1.1167,0.1134,1.0145,5.6488,2.0834,0.802,1.8273,0.028,4.0458,2.7305,1.1051,2.8592,6.3051,1.7483,0.8246,0.6095,3.8699,5.3498,3.2019,3.8473,3.0382,1.0009,1.3303,0.0002,4.8496,2.1054,0.0031,0.1666,1.9627,2.2147,2.5821,1.9592,0.7706,4.0088,0.7016,0.0267,3.3243,0.0721,1.0189,0.9653,1.4956,3.5452,0.9127,5.3565,3.6821,0.3347,0.2665,4.6123,4.2543,3.0315,3.1291,0.3639,0.6286,2.6991,1.7398,2.8646,2.237,3.6618,1.3699,0.3713,2.9581,0.097,0.0622,1.3346,2.7104,5.2703,0.1108,0.39,1.9343,0.9,3.8918,0.3666,1.1819,2.1708,1.6003,0.3646,1.3935,0.9803,5.513,1.2929,5.2344,0.3531,0.7222,2.3608,6.5004,2.0983,4.6312,1.1875,4.199,3.2374,0.6168,0.0741,0.1648,2.9384,0.6828,0.1514,0.3205,0.5632,0.0002,6.1245,0.5599,0.6638,4.9449,1.6931,2.8504,0.979,0.1775,0.6679,1.0891,2.7002,0.5815,3.773,0.0445,0.009,2.5711,0.7562,1.342,4.1373,7.421,3.5406,0.2429,2.6279,0.5583,1.819,0.6933,0.0002,2.183,5.1366,2.7186,1.5285,3.8827,1.2851,5.5136,5.648,1.058,1.0582,5.5875,5.5915,1.5102,1.0152,2.573,1.0549,1.0588,0.0002,1.7581,2.4013,4.3004,2.4279,1.537,1.5158,1.9411,3.9361,1.8834,5.3276,1.6257,4.4435,2.0961,4.7281,0.5084,4.7078,2.6492,0.584,1.901,1.9222,2.3087,1.383,5.7119,0.9477,2.9446,0.9069,2.7794,5.271,4.5921,0.5616,3.0603,4.633,5.4756,1.9163,1.9861,5.8977,1.4043,5.9927,3.2844,5.103,1.5316,0.13,4.9981,1.6145,3.6673,1.3019,5.4917,0.0014,3.7207,1.9271,1.6001,2.374,5.3018,3.8848,2.3523,1.6076,1.9399,3.4853,4.4167,7.2733,0.719,1.2417]}
{"id":3277,"ended":true,"length":558,"gen_text":"After almost 1,000 years the population of a generation ship has lost the ability to understand most technology and now lives at a preindustrial level. Today the ship reaches its destination and the automated systems come back online.\n\nHowever, in this case the ship is not on a voyage of discovery, but because of the planet's extremely dangerous conditions the captain and those on the ship are to be killed off.\n\nThis could happen on an interplanetary scale within this century.\n\nHow do we live inside the computer and not go mad? The computer is much less complex than you might guess. The human brain is comparable in size to a supercomputer. The human cortex is 4mx4m and the human neocortex is 80mx60m. The human nervous system with its 4 billion nerve cells is roughly 100,000 times more than the human brain, more than 80 feet in diameter. But the human brain is composed of 100 trillion neurons, which is about 4 times more than the number of human brain cells. As far as we can tell however, we have 4,000 million neurons.\n\nIf you cut the brain in half it turns into a computer.\n\nBut if you cut out roughly 50% of the neurons it turns into a computer with 2,000 times less complexity.\n\nSo yes the human brain is much more complicated than a computer which is 4x bigger, but computers may be capable of much more. At the moment there are no machines that are even close to the human brain's intelligence but that is changing rapidly.\n\nAn idea that originated as a child has recently been proven to work \u2014 the Turing test for intelligent machines. It's been used to create very simple programs using a very simple device and showed the machine can recognise words on a computer screen. It didn't recognise faces, but the results were promising.\n\nWe are now in a brave new world that may lead to many more successes like this.\n\nThe challenge is that the way we think about the world is fundamentally changing. In the past it was people who were seen as 'intelligent' and their decisions were taken into consideration. Now we have something that could help us to overcome the human bias.\n\nIf the internet of things is implemented it could see a huge increase in the overall IQ of people around the world. But if you can put a computer inside your refrigerator it might be far more intelligent than you and can think for itself, the world's first thought-control device.\n\nIn the future we could possibly design machines with the ability to think, learn and think for itself but we can't predict what the world's future will bring. What does science say? The human mind is really a very interesting thing, but it appears it might need a bit more work to understand. Science tells us that we are actually very limited in what powers our brain can do, and it also tells us that we are not very good at understanding our own minds.","token_len":604,"entropy":[6.9717,5.6598,0.5598,0.5671,1.107,3.1551,6.8798,0.428,5.4028,8.9267,6.952,1.8656,5.251,2.4267,1.4184,0.0212,4.8791,6.2354,6.6554,1.863,5.8538,2.8159,4.8819,1.1352,5.6865,3.2699,0.2863,0.5368,7.281,2.1082,1.9878,7.0824,2.114,4.8468,1.6042,2.057,8.3224,1.7521,5.1301,2.9654,0.1783,1.0751,2.2486,0.0196,4.3514,0.406,3.3671,2.2439,1.7972,0.8147,1.1108,1.496,1.9652,3.9295,0.9095,3.8786,2.6778,0.6545,1.2475,0.4731,6.4652,0.597,1.5302,5.8121,0.2959,5.481,3.8963,2.6343,1.6066,4.1242,2.1567,6.329,1.3832,1.8309,0.2309,1.5106,5.4773,0.7548,2.1021,3.4368,0.901,1.11,0.0002,2.9151,4.8666,1.8409,3.3134,3.6791,3.4686,0.3015,0.0001,2.2529,4.9076,3.8914,1.8505,0.8826,0.9551,0.0002,4.8519,2.2431,0.6148,4.9002,5.632,1.5003,3.8922,3.3752,3.636,4.4402,0.7132,0.1659,4.4943,3.8318,1.3507,5.8247,3.9818,2.3038,0.1933,3.5303,1.777,5.7162,0.632,2.5399,2.323,0.2442,0.6625,5.7525,1.2088,1.3836,0.1121,0.5096,5.5603,0.1392,1.1918,2.0297,1.9399,4.9667,0.8059,5.3849,8.1809,1.2999,1.2569,1.9454,1.4175,1.7032,3.6655,0.0013,0.4716,5.7501,0.8719,4.6635,0.1359,0.3178,1.4622,1.8981,3.924,0.0102,6.4927,0.8635,5.2438,1.2769,2.1949,0.2002,0.7638,3.1332,3.6671,1.4644,0.0039,0.6451,0.9736,4.9971,0.4909,1.9439,0.0921,3.5057,6.4073,0.1996,5.582,6.7985,1.487,0.3109,0.6759,4.8882,1.2756,1.3093,0.3412,0.7359,4.4155,0.1515,2.4887,2.0487,0.7774,1.4632,2.3785,1.3016,2.499,3.3876,2.7331,1.2614,0.1906,0.4043,0.8691,0.1021,3.2683,3.6447,0.0993,0.6689,5.212,3.3301,0.0131,1.3223,1.5106,0.2543,7.1728,0.2679,3.2742,1.7442,5.6196,3.1381,0.2379,4.0939,0.4598,1.3092,1.3432,0.0002,3.7335,1.0739,5.8654,1.5641,1.9663,1.4128,0.2711,2.0102,7.178,0.5015,0.9277,3.7859,1.5567,1.9853,0.0002,4.0106,3.1635,0.182,1.8923,3.0747,6.8991,3.4091,0.1614,0.038,0.2065,0.6933,1.9574,2.0038,0.0873,0.2484,1.3719,2.5052,4.4395,1.3596,0.2976,1.3023,1.5057,2.2811,0.5672,0.548,0.0002,2.6805,5.6503,2.9205,0.8555,0.1175,0.2144,2.609,0.3739,2.0558,0.2056,0.6231,0.7085,5.3361,0.5492,4.1103,2.1169,2.9204,2.5441,0.3633,4.3483,6.1666,1.021,5.3199,0.0157,2.1267,0.14,2.006,5.9565,1.1366,1.2332,3.4459,0.9997,1.8191,3.4631,0.8999,1.6057,3.4636,0.7176,0.1177,1.4856,1.6346,0.3143,2.0297,3.9138,3.9405,2.616,1.7963,1.2956,1.125,0.201,0.6104,0.0002,5.4166,5.0469,1.4942,6.0737,4.2602,0.3838,5.6851,3.6739,4.1456,0.7904,1.7102,1.1894,2.6314,5.927,1.7946,2.5431,0.6217,3.8349,3.9206,0.3897,0.2,2.5192,1.9733,3.1184,2.7849,0.7716,4.1476,6.0546,2.1085,3.7551,6.5867,2.454,2.4059,0.2656,5.6544,2.9394,5.5239,3.5547,2.4065,1.5422,4.9297,3.6706,4.7393,0.7517,3.0893,0.129,0.584,2.5479,4.3753,0.0006,1.8424,3.3461,1.0613,1.2889,2.6505,4.1316,0.8153,3.5783,0.2881,0.5697,0.0002,3.6212,1.8262,2.5042,2.4947,1.0671,5.3255,0.0158,0.1019,3.7759,3.1085,3.4789,0.1619,4.3759,2.0634,5.1322,1.6665,0.3488,0.4936,0.8068,0.0002,2.3288,5.8392,1.3546,1.7604,2.047,5.1106,0.5898,1.9904,0.8963,1.9189,1.3204,0.7955,4.0025,0.5607,0.4502,3.6058,0.6097,0.6684,2.8131,0.2479,5.0218,1.0662,2.1688,4.6778,0.2267,2.9305,2.5767,0.0069,0.4884,1.4406,3.9562,3.9619,0.9117,2.2674,2.0721,2.1512,0.3661,1.5479,1.8203,2.25,6.1817,2.4308,3.3819,5.9874,0.7024,2.5642,4.8076,1.4165,3.2133,1.5824,1.6069,0.5938,0.0002,3.4968,2.6342,5.0142,2.6709,0.0969,1.184,3.3526,2.3304,1.3052,5.6679,1.98,2.4108,1.362,0.0264,0.8783,5.9774,5.5977,0.2928,3.2491,2.7539,0.1221,0.0903,0.3338,4.4727,3.3292,2.5981,3.359,5.238,1.434,1.1488,1.3251,1.4405,6.1471,1.9562,3.1799,1.6994,5.2341,0.4707,1.3233,0.2568,0.2133,3.7197,3.5478,4.3061,1.1461,0.1706,3.0165,5.1174,4.4045,1.3788,0.8096,4.848,2.0351,3.4772,2.4786,0.4176,0.3328,0.0002,3.6237,1.111,0.9565,1.5461,1.6431,6.3436,5.416,2.4491,2.5024,2.131,1.0824,0.0159,1.1952,3.4789,2.8951,0.5943,3.6604,1.4729,1.5067,4.9998,2.2178,2.7253,0.2494,1.6987,1.0353,1.7192,2.626,2.9021,1.8561,0.5192,1.1074,0.244,4.0476,4.7514,4.9777,2.5053,1.0611,2.9305,2.8856,2.1671,0.4794,5.1807,2.7256,2.408,3.105,1.2106,2.6091,1.8701,1.2425,6.0955,3.7076,3.9205,4.6037,1.1799,2.0217,1.971,1.0967,1.4281,2.1015,1.6023,4.6787,3.6483,0.0077,0.4655,2.2513,1.0719,4.8518,2.2982,1.5212,0.6952,1.5239,9.0111,2.0762,2.443,3.4442,2.3368,2.0112,1.9351,2.6465,3.7796,0.4886,0.0039,0.2388,1.4913,1.0833,1.9619,2.5903,1.6801,0.0295,2.0095,1.8664,0.3071,0.9707,0.264]}
{"id":81,"ended":true,"length":558,"gen_text":"After almost 1,000 years the population of a generation ship has lost the ability to understand most technology and now lives at a preindustrial level. Today the ship reaches its destination and the automated systems come back online.\n\nHowever, in this case the ship is not on a voyage of discovery, but because of the planet's extremely dangerous conditions the captain and those on the ship are to be killed off.\n\nThis could happen on an interplanetary scale within this century.\n\nHow do we live inside the computer and not go mad? The computer is much less complex than you might guess. The human brain is comparable in size to a supercomputer. The human cortex is 4mx4m and the human neocortex is 80mx60m. The human nervous system with its 4 billion nerve cells is roughly 100,000 times more than the human brain, more than 80 feet in diameter. But the human brain is composed of 100 trillion neurons, which is about 4 times more than the number of human brain cells. As far as we can tell however, we have 4,000 million neurons.\n\nIf you cut the brain in half it turns into a computer.\n\nBut if you cut out roughly 50% of the neurons it turns into a computer with 2,000 times less complexity.\n\nSo yes the human brain is much more complicated than a computer which is 4x bigger, but computers may be capable of much more. At the moment there are no machines that are even close to the human brain's intelligence but that is changing rapidly.\n\nAn idea that originated as a child has recently been proven to work \u2014 the Turing test for intelligent machines. It's been used to create very simple programs using a very simple device and showed the machine can recognise words on a computer screen. It didn't recognise faces, but the results were promising.\n\nWe are now in a brave new world that may lead to many more successes like this.\n\nThe challenge is that the way we think about the world is fundamentally changing. In the past it was people who were seen as 'intelligent' and their decisions were taken into consideration. Now we have something that could help us to overcome the human bias.\n\nIf the internet of things is implemented it could see a huge increase in the overall IQ of people around the world. But if you can put a computer inside your refrigerator it might be far more intelligent than you and can think for itself, the world's first thought-control device.\n\nIn the future we could possibly design machines with the ability to think, learn and think for itself but we can't predict what the world's future will bring. What does science say? The human mind is really a very interesting thing, but it appears it might need a bit more work to understand. Science tells us that we are actually very limited in what powers our brain can do, and it also tells us that we are not very good at understanding our own minds.","token_len":604,"entropy":[6.9717,5.6598,0.5598,0.5671,1.107,3.1551,6.8798,0.428,5.4028,8.9267,6.952,1.8656,5.251,2.4267,1.4184,0.0212,4.8791,6.2354,6.6554,1.863,5.8538,2.8159,4.8819,1.1352,5.6865,3.2699,0.2863,0.5368,7.281,2.1082,1.9878,7.0824,2.114,4.8468,1.6042,2.057,8.3224,1.7521,5.1301,2.9654,0.1783,1.0751,2.2486,0.0196,4.3514,0.406,3.3671,2.2439,1.7972,0.8147,1.1108,1.496,1.9652,3.9295,0.9095,3.8786,2.6778,0.6545,1.2475,0.4731,6.4652,0.597,1.5302,5.8121,0.2959,5.481,3.8963,2.6343,1.6066,4.1242,2.1567,6.329,1.3832,1.8309,0.2309,1.5106,5.4773,0.7548,2.1021,3.4368,0.901,1.11,0.0002,2.9151,4.8666,1.8409,3.3134,3.6791,3.4686,0.3015,0.0001,2.2529,4.9076,3.8914,1.8505,0.8826,0.9551,0.0002,4.8519,2.2431,0.6148,4.9002,5.632,1.5003,3.8922,3.3752,3.636,4.4402,0.7132,0.1659,4.4943,3.8318,1.3507,5.8247,3.9818,2.3038,0.1933,3.5303,1.777,5.7162,0.632,2.5399,2.323,0.2442,0.6625,5.7525,1.2088,1.3836,0.1121,0.5096,5.5603,0.1392,1.1918,2.0297,1.9399,4.9667,0.8059,5.3849,8.1809,1.2999,1.2569,1.9454,1.4175,1.7032,3.6655,0.0013,0.4716,5.7501,0.8719,4.6635,0.1359,0.3178,1.4622,1.8981,3.924,0.0102,6.4927,0.8635,5.2438,1.2769,2.1949,0.2002,0.7638,3.1332,3.6671,1.4644,0.0039,0.6451,0.9736,4.9971,0.4909,1.9439,0.0921,3.5057,6.4073,0.1996,5.582,6.7985,1.487,0.3109,0.6759,4.8882,1.2756,1.3093,0.3412,0.7359,4.4155,0.1515,2.4887,2.0487,0.7774,1.4632,2.3785,1.3016,2.499,3.3876,2.7331,1.2614,0.1906,0.4043,0.8691,0.1021,3.2683,3.6447,0.0993,0.6689,5.212,3.3301,0.0131,1.3223,1.5106,0.2543,7.1728,0.2679,3.2742,1.7442,5.6196,3.1381,0.2379,4.0939,0.4598,1.3092,1.3432,0.0002,3.7335,1.0739,5.8654,1.5641,1.9663,1.4128,0.2711,2.0102,7.178,0.5015,0.9277,3.7859,1.5567,1.9853,0.0002,4.0106,3.1635,0.182,1.8923,3.0747,6.8991,3.4091,0.1614,0.038,0.2065,0.6933,1.9574,2.0038,0.0873,0.2484,1.3719,2.5052,4.4395,1.3596,0.2976,1.3023,1.5057,2.2811,0.5672,0.548,0.0002,2.6805,5.6503,2.9205,0.8555,0.1175,0.2144,2.609,0.3739,2.0558,0.2056,0.6231,0.7085,5.3361,0.5492,4.1103,2.1169,2.9204,2.5441,0.3633,4.3483,6.1666,1.021,5.3199,0.0157,2.1267,0.14,2.006,5.9565,1.1366,1.2332,3.4459,0.9997,1.8191,3.4631,0.8999,1.6057,3.4636,0.7176,0.1177,1.4856,1.6346,0.3143,2.0297,3.9138,3.9405,2.616,1.7963,1.2956,1.125,0.201,0.6104,0.0002,5.4166,5.0469,1.4942,6.0737,4.2602,0.3838,5.6851,3.6739,4.1456,0.7904,1.7102,1.1894,2.6314,5.927,1.7946,2.5431,0.6217,3.8349,3.9206,0.3897,0.2,2.5192,1.9733,3.1184,2.7849,0.7716,4.1476,6.0546,2.1085,3.7551,6.5867,2.454,2.4059,0.2656,5.6544,2.9394,5.5239,3.5547,2.4065,1.5422,4.9297,3.6706,4.7393,0.7517,3.0893,0.129,0.584,2.5479,4.3753,0.0006,1.8424,3.3461,1.0613,1.2889,2.6505,4.1316,0.8153,3.5783,0.2881,0.5697,0.0002,3.6212,1.8262,2.5042,2.4947,1.0671,5.3255,0.0158,0.1019,3.7759,3.1085,3.4789,0.1619,4.3759,2.0634,5.1322,1.6665,0.3488,0.4936,0.8068,0.0002,2.3288,5.8392,1.3546,1.7604,2.047,5.1106,0.5898,1.9904,0.8963,1.9189,1.3204,0.7955,4.0025,0.5607,0.4502,3.6058,0.6097,0.6684,2.8131,0.2479,5.0218,1.0662,2.1688,4.6778,0.2267,2.9305,2.5767,0.0069,0.4884,1.4406,3.9562,3.9619,0.9117,2.2674,2.0721,2.1512,0.3661,1.5479,1.8203,2.25,6.1817,2.4308,3.3819,5.9874,0.7024,2.5642,4.8076,1.4165,3.2133,1.5824,1.6069,0.5938,0.0002,3.4968,2.6342,5.0142,2.6709,0.0969,1.184,3.3526,2.3304,1.3052,5.6679,1.98,2.4108,1.362,0.0264,0.8783,5.9774,5.5977,0.2928,3.2491,2.7539,0.1221,0.0903,0.3338,4.4727,3.3292,2.5981,3.359,5.238,1.434,1.1488,1.3251,1.4405,6.1471,1.9562,3.1799,1.6994,5.2341,0.4707,1.3233,0.2568,0.2133,3.7197,3.5478,4.3061,1.1461,0.1706,3.0165,5.1174,4.4045,1.3788,0.8096,4.848,2.0351,3.4772,2.4786,0.4176,0.3328,0.0002,3.6237,1.111,0.9565,1.5461,1.6431,6.3436,5.416,2.4491,2.5024,2.131,1.0824,0.0159,1.1952,3.4789,2.8951,0.5943,3.6604,1.4729,1.5067,4.9998,2.2178,2.7253,0.2494,1.6987,1.0353,1.7192,2.626,2.9021,1.8561,0.5192,1.1074,0.244,4.0476,4.7514,4.9777,2.5053,1.0611,2.9305,2.8856,2.1671,0.4794,5.1807,2.7256,2.408,3.105,1.2106,2.6091,1.8701,1.2425,6.0955,3.7076,3.9205,4.6037,1.1799,2.0217,1.971,1.0967,1.4281,2.1015,1.6023,4.6787,3.6483,0.0077,0.4655,2.2513,1.0719,4.8518,2.2982,1.5212,0.6952,1.5239,9.0111,2.0762,2.443,3.4442,2.3368,2.0112,1.9351,2.6465,3.7796,0.4886,0.0039,0.2388,1.4913,1.0833,1.9619,2.5903,1.6801,0.0295,2.0095,1.8664,0.3071,0.9707,0.264]}
{"id":2779,"ended":false,"length":572,"gen_text":"After centuries of humans waging war and murder on each other, we are visited by an alien ship seeking our guidance and help to find peace and love, as humans are the most peaceful race in the galaxy.\n\nHowever, when they landed, they were attacked by many humanoids!\n\nThe people of planet Earth quickly learned about the attack and soon the peace-loving Earth humans have become the new masters of the universe once again!\n\nMeanwhile on the Planet of Love and Peace, the Earth humans have established a thriving civilization in the vast jungle and jungles where they are able to exist in harmony, peace and safety for all creatures that have evolved on planet Earth.\n\nIn this way Earth humanity is able to fulfill their quest to find eternal peace and happiness.\n\nThe universe is filled with countless races which have different views on life. Some people see life as being extremely good, others as extremely bad. It is the duty of them to follow their opinions and the decisions they take and never allow any harm to be done to another being. They strive to live happy, peaceful and healthy lives.\n\nAt the center of the galaxy stands a planet named Earth.\n\nThis is a fictional universe based on some real worlds real life history and events.\n\nTo give you a very vague idea about the plot :\n\nIn the near future, a ship which was sent from another planet arrived to our system. It had passengers, who were supposed to receive the gift sent to them from planet earth. On this ship the passengers had a choice to make. They could either live as they had always done on that planet : enjoy the beauty of nature, live in peace and happiness or leave the ship to go further in the galaxy and save the planet Earth. If they chose to leave their ship they would be able to save at least one other life on the planet Earth!\n\nThis decision would have a great impact on the nature of the universe. On Earth many humans felt that those whom they called as the \"superheroes\" were just trying to save one day one person when actually it was their mission to save all people on Earth! Other people have said that they were trying to help the needy while in reality they only took their \"hero\" power away and used it to fight for their own selfish agenda. We also know that some people were not happy with the mission and had many misunderstandings.

{"id":878,"ended":true,"length":558,"gen_text":"After almost 1,000 years the population of a generation ship has lost the ability to understand most technology and now lives at a preindustrial level. Today the ship reaches its destination and the automated systems come back online.\n\nHowever, in this case the ship is not on a voyage of discovery, but because of the planet's extremely dangerous conditions the captain and those on the ship are to be killed off.\n\nThis could happen on an interplanetary scale within this century.\n\nHow do we live inside the computer and not go mad? The computer is much less complex than you might guess. The human brain is comparable in size to a supercomputer. The human cortex is 4mx4m and the human neocortex is 80mx60m. The human nervous system with its 4 billion nerve cells is roughly 100,000 times more than the human brain, more than 80 feet in diameter. But the human brain is composed of 100 trillion neurons, which is about 4 times more than the number of human brain cells. As far as we can tell however, we have 4,000 million neurons.\n\nIf you cut the brain in half it turns into a computer.\n\nBut if you cut out roughly 50% of the neurons it turns into a computer with 2,000 times less complexity.\n\nSo yes the human brain is much more complicated than a computer which is 4x bigger, but computers may be capable of much more. At the moment there are no machines that are even close to the human brain's intelligence but that is changing rapidly.\n\nAn idea that originated as a child has recently been proven to work \u2014 the Turing test for intelligent machines. It's been used to create very simple programs using a very simple device and showed the machine can recognise words on a computer screen. It didn't recognise faces, but the results were promising.\n\nWe are now in a brave new world that may lead to many more successes like this.\n\nThe challenge is that the way we think about the world is fundamentally changing. In the past it was people who were seen as 'intelligent' and their decisions were taken into consideration. Now we have something that could help us to overcome the human bias.\n\nIf the internet of things is implemented it could see a huge increase in the overall IQ of people around the world. But if you can put a computer inside your refrigerator it might be far more intelligent than you and can think for itself, the world's first thought-control device.\n\nIn the future we could possibly design machines with the ability to think, learn and think for itself but we can't predict what the world's future will bring. What does science say? The human mind is really a very interesting thing, but it appears it might need a bit more work to understand. Science tells us that we are actually very limited in what powers our brain can do, and it also tells us that we are not very good at understanding our own minds.","token_len":604,"entropy":[6.9717,5.6598,0.5598,0.5671,1.107,3.1551,6.8798,0.428,5.4028,8.9267,6.952,1.8656,5.251,2.4267,1.4184,0.0212,4.8791,6.2354,6.6554,1.863,5.8538,2.8159,4.8819,1.1352,5.6865,3.2699,0.2863,0.5368,7.281,2.1082,1.9878,7.0824,2.114,4.8468,1.6042,2.057,8.3224,1.7521,5.1301,2.9654,0.1783,1.0751,2.2486,0.0196,4.3514,0.406,3.3671,2.2439,1.7972,0.8147,1.1108,1.496,1.9652,3.9295,0.9095,3.8786,2.6778,0.6545,1.2475,0.4731,6.4652,0.597,1.5302,5.8121,0.2959,5.481,3.8963,2.6343,1.6066,4.1242,2.1567,6.329,1.3832,1.8309,0.2309,1.5106,5.4773,0.7548,2.1021,3.4368,0.901,1.11,0.0002,2.9151,4.8666,1.8409,3.3134,3.6791,3.4686,0.3015,0.0001,2.2529,4.9076,3.8914,1.8505,0.8826,0.9551,0.0002,4.8519,2.2431,0.6148,4.9002,5.632,1.5003,3.8922,3.3752,3.636,4.4402,0.7132,0.1659,4.4943,3.8318,1.3507,5.8247,3.9818,2.3038,0.1933,3.5303,1.777,5.7162,0.632,2.5399,2.323,0.2442,0.6625,5.7525,1.2088,1.3836,0.1121,0.5096,5.5603,0.1392,1.1918,2.0297,1.9399,4.9667,0.8059,5.3849,8.1809,1.2999,1.2569,1.9454,1.4175,1.7032,3.6655,0.0013,0.4716,5.7501,0.8719,4.6635,0.1359,0.3178,1.4622,1.8981,3.924,0.0102,6.4927,0.8635,5.2438,1.2769,2.1949,0.2002,0.7638,3.1332,3.6671,1.4644,0.0039,0.6451,0.9736,4.9971,0.4909,1.9439,0.0921,3.5057,6.4073,0.1996,5.582,6.7985,1.487,0.3109,0.6759,4.8882,1.2756,1.3093,0.3412,0.7359,4.4155,0.1515,2.4887,2.0487,0.7774,1.4632,2.3785,1.3016,2.499,3.3876,2.7331,1.2614,0.1906,0.4043,0.8691,0.1021,3.2683,3.6447,0.0993,0.6689,5.212,3.3301,0.0131,1.3223,1.5106,0.2543,7.1728,0.2679,3.2742,1.7442,5.6196,3.1381,0.2379,4.0939,0.4598,1.3092,1.3432,0.0002,3.7335,1.0739,5.8654,1.5641,1.9663,1.4128,0.2711,2.0102,7.178,0.5015,0.9277,3.7859,1.5567,1.9853,0.0002,4.0106,3.1635,0.182,1.8923,3.0747,6.8991,3.4091,0.1614,0.038,0.2065,0.6933,1.9574,2.0038,0.0873,0.2484,1.3719,2.5052,4.4395,1.3596,0.2976,1.3023,1.5057,2.2811,0.5672,0.548,0.0002,2.6805,5.6503,2.9205,0.8555,0.1175,0.2144,2.609,0.3739,2.0558,0.2056,0.6231,0.7085,5.3361,0.5492,4.1103,2.1169,2.9204,2.5441,0.3633,4.3483,6.1666,1.021,5.3199,0.0157,2.1267,0.14,2.006,5.9565,1.1366,1.2332,3.4459,0.9997,1.8191,3.4631,0.8999,1.6057,3.4636,0.7176,0.1177,1.4856,1.6346,0.3143,2.0297,3.9138,3.9405,2.616,1.7963,1.2956,1.125,0.201,0.6104,0.0002,5.4166,5.0469,1.4942,6.0737,4.2602,0.3838,5.6851,3.6739,4.1456,0.7904,1.7102,1.1894,2.6314,5.927,1.7946,2.5431,0.6217,3.8349,3.9206,0.3897,0.2,2.5192,1.9733,3.1184,2.7849,0.7716,4.1476,6.0546,2.1085,3.7551,6.5867,2.454,2.4059,0.2656,5.6544,2.9394,5.5239,3.5547,2.4065,1.5422,4.9297,3.6706,4.7393,0.7517,3.0893,0.129,0.584,2.5479,4.3753,0.0006,1.8424,3.3461,1.0613,1.2889,2.6505,4.1316,0.8153,3.5783,0.2881,0.5697,0.0002,3.6212,1.8262,2.5042,2.4947,1.0671,5.3255,0.0158,0.1019,3.7759,3.1085,3.4789,0.1619,4.3759,2.0634,5.1322,1.6665,0.3488,0.4936,0.8068,0.0002,2.3288,5.8392,1.3546,1.7604,2.047,5.1106,0.5898,1.9904,0.8963,1.9189,1.3204,0.7955,4.0025,0.5607,0.4502,3.6058,0.6097,0.6684,2.8131,0.2479,5.0218,1.0662,2.1688,4.6778,0.2267,2.9305,2.5767,0.0069,0.4884,1.4406,3.9562,3.9619,0.9117,2.2674,2.0721,2.1512,0.3661,1.5479,1.8203,2.25,6.1817,2.4308,3.3819,5.9874,0.7024,2.5642,4.8076,1.4165,3.2133,1.5824,1.6069,0.5938,0.0002,3.4968,2.6342,5.0142,2.6709,0.0969,1.184,3.3526,2.3304,1.3052,5.6679,1.98,2.4108,1.362,0.0264,0.8783,5.9774,5.5977,0.2928,3.2491,2.7539,0.1221,0.0903,0.3338,4.4727,3.3292,2.5981,3.359,5.238,1.434,1.1488,1.3251,1.4405,6.1471,1.9562,3.1799,1.6994,5.2341,0.4707,1.3233,0.2568,0.2133,3.7197,3.5478,4.3061,1.1461,0.1706,3.0165,5.1174,4.4045,1.3788,0.8096,4.848,2.0351,3.4772,2.4786,0.4176,0.3328,0.0002,3.6237,1.111,0.9565,1.5461,1.6431,6.3436,5.416,2.4491,2.5024,2.131,1.0824,0.0159,1.1952,3.4789,2.8951,0.5943,3.6604,1.4729,1.5067,4.9998,2.2178,2.7253,0.2494,1.6987,1.0353,1.7192,2.626,2.9021,1.8561,0.5192,1.1074,0.244,4.0476,4.7514,4.9777,2.5053,1.0611,2.9305,2.8856,2.1671,0.4794,5.1807,2.7256,2.408,3.105,1.2106,2.6091,1.8701,1.2425,6.0955,3.7076,3.9205,4.6037,1.1799,2.0217,1.971,1.0967,1.4281,2.1015,1.6023,4.6787,3.6483,0.0077,0.4655,2.2513,1.0719,4.8518,2.2982,1.5212,0.6952,1.5239,9.0111,2.0762,2.443,3.4442,2.3368,2.0112,1.9351,2.6465,3.7796,0.4886,0.0039,0.2388,1.4913,1.0833,1.9619,2.5903,1.6801,0.0295,2.0095,1.8664,0.3071,0.9707,0.264]}

He wants to keep the soul in Devil's Hell for eternity.\n\nSo that's why we're going to hell!\n\nDon't worry, it'll be so much fun!\n\nSo, why is God so angry with people who believe in God? Well, some people want to spend their time with Him. And the only way you can save the world isn't giving up. So they do the next best thing, and make it impossible: They turn us all into demons.\n\nWell... now that isn't such a good idea, is it?\n\nEven if we die (or stay alive) in this world, our entire selves will be destroyed, so we'll never get to experience the kind of life God knows we deserve.\n\nBut luckily, there's a secret that will keep your soul alive forever, even without our help \u2014 the power of the Holy Spirit!\n\nHere's just a quick glimpse of what Hell will actually be like.\n\nOh, also: \"It's your fault for getting caught up in this mess!\"","token_len":604,"entropy":[3.305,2.3842,8.6567,0.8425,3.8098,0.0507,3.4652,5.5824,2.799,1.9793,1.683,8.4479,1.2409,8.2117,0.1233,5.1983,5.1047,1.402,2.4024,2.3449,7.4112,0.0389,2.0901,0.684,2.364,6.562,9.5062,2.4718,0.9165,1.4183,0.3241,3.0495,0.6971,0.0215,5.6876,1.1719,0.0491,0.2782,0.2727,0.7602,1.888,0.0074,6.8305,2.2603,4.7013,0.0327,0.0082,0.0043,0.0022,0.0011,0.0047,0.0036,0.0013,9.6667,5.7213,1.541,3.4949,3.9703,4.2175,0.2703,0.0209,0.4429,0.6193,0.8043,4.1257,5.3932,1.0424,0.0592,0.0017,0.0415,0.1576,2.2037,0.0482,2.0576,3.5751,3.184,0.9882,0.4265,0.0001,2.8811,3.1408,0.2896,0.0017,0.0009,0.0007,0.0011,0.0028,0.0064,0.0009,0.0068,0.002,7.5633,3.5658,5.3823,0.2784,3.9566,3.5924,2.9292,4.8442,5.747,6.7535,2.0552,1.2663,2.6646,2.0528,0.1138,0.5194,1.0955,3.0607,6.1083,2.4755,5.8041,0.3626,3.4535,1.3165,0.5754,0.5822,0.0001,1.307,1.2292,1.3149,5.6225,5.9704,2.9539,0.9936,1.8475,3.6013,1.1499,4.6791,0.1689,0.5676,3.7972,5.1368,1.9306,2.909,2.9828,1.6872,5.481,0.5771,5.5144,0.6604,2.4446,2.952,5.0036,0.0833,1.9239,5.2141,1.9848,1.4974,3.8286,0.8406,1.1899,2.2721,6.4139,0.6012,0.8228,0.0002,0.6004,2.8469,0.8188,0.1567,0.0613,0.5113,0.0668,0.0681,0.0058,0.0658,0.0029,0.0041,0.0052,8.0136,6.1758,4.6343,2.9694,1.4438,1.4441,0.7918,2.941,0.6593,3.5062,2.7395,1.5014,3.207,3.4493,0.0752,4.4718,2.5468,0.8859,1.3889,0.98,1.5415,0.4578,0.0002,6.2299,2.0942,0.0701,6.2677,0.2231,0.547,0.0043,6.7742,1.6314,1.8811,3.0386,2.9676,1.1686,1.2594,0.3498,2.5773,6.2473,3.5604,2.5598,1.2424,0.468,0.0002,5.6865,3.8504,2.6912,1.1052,0.3834,0.3954,0.315,0.0002,4.1181,0.3685,0.0881,0.3599,4.3042,0.676,3.1494,0.7597,4.199,0.8035,3.0875,2.0831,3.4776,0.607,4.2434,0.2386,0.097,3.6848,0.0599,4.9537,0.2201,5.2777,2.1285,4.4632,4.2696,4.4147,1.6488,1.2565,0.083,0.8277,1.6311,1.0301,0.0002,3.2442,2.0638,4.2016,4.9465,2.0573,4.0137,4.8676,2.2376,2.8402,0.3244,0.4253,0.2281,0.5378,0.0002,4.1219,1.567,3.4348,3.3304,0.9361,3.3546,0.6201,1.9494,0.1398,2.7731,1.5064,1.9377,0.9061,4.8063,0.7022,1.091,0.1187,1.9935,0.6287,5.5899,1.2967,0.7308,0.5011,0.3852,3.4085,2.5153,0.4948,2.0298,3.0376,0.2202,0.4575,1.1895,0.218,4.3878,0.6752,3.008,4.2204,3.3074,1.5289,1.5832,0.0761,0.8054,0.2403,2.351,0.8609,0.4449,5.3391,2.4064,4.9978,1.2495,3.0828,1.9203,0.7237,3.818,2.429,0.4995,2.6872,0.7576,2.0102,3.2555,2.0848,0.4999,0.6245,3.9273,0.6579,1.1519,4.2735,0.1896,0.0112,4.9911,0.7813,4.339,3.232,1.3431,0.6986,0.4575,2.2447,0.8267,1.3859,1.2855,3.6565,1.2304,4.1675,1.1163,0.0411,0.0015,0.5894,1.3292,2.8459,0.5039,0.4693,0.0002,3.7806,2.5899,3.002,5.5027,5.6173,0.1842,2.4355,5.4898,1.7916,2.2225,0.4597,0.0034,1.4873,1.5954,0.3643,5.3442,5.7012,0.0004,3.9381,1.9443,0.8031,1.0393,0.7414,0.9275,1.9036,0.7305,1.0706,2.3605,0.7468,2.1865,6.0494,0.2802,1.5167,2.3361,1.1158,0.7334,1.5236,0.0002,2.8318,3.4938,0.1637,1.8036,3.1549,2.1796,2.459,0.1618,1.8371,3.1679,0.7009,0.0002,6.348,0.0135,0.6515,0.8833,2.7236,2.3502,0.4376,4.9667,0.3092,0.6415,0.6928,0.3896,0.0002,3.5137,2.0462,3.8985,2.1927,3.3361,1.756,1.7789,0.6995,4.2316,1.5477,3.0663,0.0648,1.4661,0.1703,2.9098,0.1598,4.9994,0.561,4.6995,0.1747,4.3122,1.6302,2.3626,1.2427,1.7153,1.5908,1.6088,3.903,2.746,0.2205,3.148,0.2025,6.5968,3.0446,0.8993,7.2757,0.0007,7.0805,1.045,2.2782,3.5218,3.7243,3.9501,2.2887,3.578,0.1321,0.0033,2.5619,0.7704,3.0754,2.4444,2.6019,6.4847,2.0332,4.8956,3.7187,1.0396,0.055,2.2668,0.5702,0.6806,0.0002,4.6009,3.1443,5.1687,1.5559,5.4942,0.0007,3.8846,0.0194,1.4991,0.368,1.7614,0.3087,0.0009,0.0459,0.5996,0.0002,5.7207,1.3229,1.8084,4.1068,4.5839,1.6995,4.2874,2.2525,1.6895,2.2831,2.0781,0.8408,0.2464,2.5921,7.1663,5.0637,0.7589,1.1175,3.0,2.4362,2.0563,1.1378,1.391,1.1864,2.7293,0.6723,3.1252,1.9565,4.8346,0.003,1.2729,1.2517,5.6209,0.672,0.8933,0.1167,1.0336,0.0002,1.9588,5.6336,0.3866,1.3814,0.4805,0.5717,5.1031,2.58,1.7307,3.3648,3.2802,0.3196,1.7311,1.7499,1.9992,1.9578,4.6502,3.8033,1.435,8.7879,2.3968,1.3711,0.1287,2.2874,1.2383,0.213,2.0392,0.4871,0.0002,5.1182,0.2322,5.5307,0.6213,3.3516,3.3153,0.6581,0.7159,4.1637,1.5686,4.0154,0.4506,0.0171,1.6715,0.6702,0.0002,4.7274,0.4496,5.9561,2.9438,5.7489,4.2305,0.5069,4.9077,1.2977,2.4049,2.9079,4.7157,0.3471,0.0729,2.0622,1.6629,1.2443]}

So they do the next best thing, and make it impossible: They turn us all into demons.\n\nWell... now that isn't such a good idea, is it?\n\nEven if we die (or stay alive) in this world, our entire selves will be destroyed, so we'll never get to experience the kind of life God knows we deserve.\n\nBut luckily, there's a secret that will keep your soul alive forever, even without our help \u2014 the power of the Holy Spirit!\n\nHere's just a quick glimpse of what Hell will actually be like.\n\nOh, also: \"It's your fault for getting caught up in this mess!\"","token_len":604,"entropy":[3.305,2.3842,8.6567,0.8425,3.8098,0.0507,3.4652,5.5824,2.799,1.9793,1.683,8.4479,1.2409,8.2117,0.1233,5.1983,5.1047,1.402,2.4024,2.3449,7.4112,0.0389,2.0901,0.684,2.364,6.562,9.5062,2.4718,0.9165,1.4183,0.3241,3.0495,0.6971,0.0215,5.6876,1.1719,0.0491,0.2782,0.2727,0.7602,1.888,0.0074,6.8305,2.2603,4.7013,0.0327,0.0082,0.0043,0.0022,0.0011,0.0047,0.0036,0.0013,9.6667,5.7213,1.541,3.4949,3.9703,4.2175,0.2703,0.0209,0.4429,0.6193,0.8043,4.1257,5.3932,1.0424,0.0592,0.0017,0.0415,0.1576,2.2037,0.0482,2.0576,3.5751,3.184,0.9882,0.4265,0.0001,2.8811,3.1408,0.2896,0.0017,0.0009,0.0007,0.0011,0.0028,0.0064,0.0009,0.0068,0.002,7.5633,3.5658,5.3823,0.2784,3.9566,3.5924,2.9292,4.8442,5.747,6.7535,2.0552,1.2663,2.6646,2.0528,0.1138,0.5194,1.0955,3.0607,6.1083,2.4755,5.8041,0.3626,3.4535,1.3165,0.5754,0.5822,0.0001,1.307,1.2292,1.3149,5.6225,5.9704,2.9539,0.9936,1.8475,3.6013,1.1499,4.6791,0.1689,0.5676,3.7972,5.1368,1.9306,2.909,2.9828,1.6872,5.481,0.5771,5.5144,0.6604,2.4446,2.952,5.0036,0.0833,1.9239,5.2141,1.9848,1.4974,3.8286,0.8406,1.1899,2.2721,6.4139,0.6012,0.8228,0.0002,0.6004,2.8469,0.8188,0.1567,0.0613,0.5113,0.0668,0.0681,0.0058,0.0658,0.0029,0.0041,0.0052,8.0136,6.1758,4.6343,2.9694,1.4438,1.4441,0.7918,2.941,0.6593,3.5062,2.7395,1.5014,3.207,3.4493,0.0752,4.4718,2.5468,0.8859,1.3889,0.98,1.5415,0.4578,0.0002,6.2299,2.0942,0.0701,6.2677,0.2231,0.547,0.0043,6.7742,1.6314,1.8811,3.0386,2.9676,1.1686,1.2594,0.3498,2.5773,6.2473,3.5604,2.5598,1.2424,0.468,0.0002,5.6865,3.8504,2.6912,1.1052,0.3834,0.3954,0.315,0.0002,4.1181,0.3685,0.0881,0.3599,4.3042,0.676,3.1494,0.7597,4.199,0.8035,3.0875,2.0831,3.4776,0.607,4.2434,0.2386,0.097,3.6848,0.0599,4.9537,0.2201,5.2777,2.1285,4.4632,4.2696,4.4147,1.6488,1.2565,0.083,0.8277,1.6311,1.0301,0.0002,3.2442,2.0638,4.2016,4.9465,2.0573,4.0137,4.8676,2.2376,2.8402,0.3244,0.4253,0.2281,0.5378,0.0002,4.1219,1.567,3.4348,3.3304,0.9361,3.3546,0.6201,1.9494,0.1398,2.7731,1.5064,1.9377,0.9061,4.8063,0.7022,1.091,0.1187,1.9935,0.6287,5.5899,1.2967,0.7308,0.5011,0.3852,3.4085,2.5153,0.4948,2.0298,3.0376,0.2202,0.4575,1.1895,0.218,4.3878,0.6752,3.008,4.2204,3.3074,1.5289,1.5832,0.0761,0.8054,0.2403,2.351,0.8609,0.4449,5.3391,2.4064,4.9978,1.2495,3.0828,1.9203,0.7237,3.818,2.429,0.4995,2.6872,0.7576,2.0102,3.2555,2.0848,0.4999,0.6245,3.9273,0.6579,1.1519,4.2735,0.1896,0.0112,4.9911,0.7813,4.339,3.232,1.3431,0.6986,0.4575,2.2447,0.8267,1.3859,1.2855,3.6565,1.2304,4.1675,1.1163,0.0411,0.0015,0.5894,1.3292,2.8459,0.5039,0.4693,0.0002,3.7806,2.5899,3.002,5.5027,5.6173,0.1842,2.4355,5.4898,1.7916,2.2225,0.4597,0.0034,1.4873,1.5954,0.3643,5.3442,5.7012,0.0004,3.9381,1.9443,0.8031,1.0393,0.7414,0.9275,1.9036,0.7305,1.0706,2.3605,0.7468,2.1865,6.0494,0.2802,1.5167,2.3361,1.1158,0.7334,1.5236,0.0002,2.8318,3.4938,0.1637,1.8036,3.1549,2.1796,2.459,0.1618,1.8371,3.1679,0.7009,0.0002,6.348,0.0135,0.6515,0.8833,2.7236,2.3502,0.4376,4.9667,0.3092,0.6415,0.6928,0.3896,0.0002,3.5137,2.0462,3.8985,2.1927,3.3361,1.756,1.7789,0.6995,4.2316,1.5477,3.0663,0.0648,1.4661,0.1703,2.9098,0.1598,4.9994,0.561,4.6995,0.1747,4.3122,1.6302,2.3626,1.2427,1.7153,1.5908,1.6088,3.903,2.746,0.2205,3.148,0.2025,6.5968,3.0446,0.8993,7.2757,0.0007,7.0805,1.045,2.2782,3.5218,3.7243,3.9501,2.2887,3.578,0.1321,0.0033,2.5619,0.7704,3.0754,2.4444,2.6019,6.4847,2.0332,4.8956,3.7187,1.0396,0.055,2.2668,0.5702,0.6806,0.0002,4.6009,3.1443,5.1687,1.5559,5.4942,0.0007,3.8846,0.0194,1.4991,0.368,1.7614,0.3087,0.0009,0.0459,0.5996,0.0002,5.7207,1.3229,1.8084,4.1068,4.5839,1.6995,4.2874,2.2525,1.6895,2.2831,2.0781,0.8408,0.2464,2.5921,7.1663,5.0637,0.7589,1.1175,3.0,2.4362,2.0563,1.1378,1.391,1.1864,2.7293,0.6723,3.1252,1.9565,4.8346,0.003,1.2729,1.2517,5.6209,0.672,0.8933,0.1167,1.0336,0.0002,1.9588,5.6336,0.3866,1.3814,0.4805,0.5717,5.1031,2.58,1.7307,3.3648,3.2802,0.3196,1.7311,1.7499,1.9992,1.9578,4.6502,3.8033,1.435,8.7879,2.3968,1.3711,0.1287,2.2874,1.2383,0.213,2.0392,0.4871,0.0002,5.1182,0.2322,5.5307,0.6213,3.3516,3.3153,0.6581,0.7159,4.1637,1.5686,4.0154,0.4506,0.0171,1.6715,0.6702,0.0002,4.7274,0.4496,5.9561,2.9438,5.7489,4.2305,0.5069,4.9077,1.2977,2.4049,2.9079,4.7157,0.3471,0.0729,2.0622,1.6629,1.2443]}
{"id":196,"ended":true,"length":569,"gen_text":"Aperson with the ability to see into the emotional lives of others through touch realizes the happiest most good-natured person they have ever known is actually hiding a tremendous emotional darkness.... People that are genuinely happy to be around others are the happiest people to be around.\n\nThis seems like a great thing to say to a new-age psych clog, but as you can see, it's not.\n\nIn his book, In Search of Happiness and Meaning, Charles Duhigg points out a few more errors in this claim:\n\n1) The author is using the word \"emotional\" to describe emotions that are rooted in people who lack self-esteem and have a low self-image. That's a completely wrong way to think about human emotions: If you want to understand how they work, you have to understand what makes us happy. You can't blame our emotions on whether or not we can feel things; your parents, your significant other, your best friends and everyone else in our lives have something about them that's meaningful to us.\n\n2) People who are feeling good about themselves tend not to show it in their speech or their behavior. They'll try to act like they're happy, but they aren't (we can see it in their expressions).\n\n3) When we try to measure which people (people in our own lives) are feeling the best, we often misdiagnose the source of the feeling: If we're really measuring happiness, the same people who are feeling good most of the time are always feeling the best.\n\n4) What makes us happy and how can we tell if someone else is? If we're using the word \"happiness\" to describe the effects of good relationships and positive outcomes in our personal lives, I'm afraid that a little more thinking in this area would be in order.\n\nIn this sense, then, the author's claim is a little like Einstein's claim that the universe was not expanding; it's only meaningful if it reflects back on events in people's lives. And this is an extremely vague claim at that: We have no way of explaining what makes someone happy.\n\n5) And the author of the article misses the crucial point that happiness can't be measured without talking to actual people, and measuring their real-life emotions. If you ask one of the dozens of people who write letters to the Wall Street Journal, they'll tell you that their happiness lies in their job -- working hard and contributing. If you ask someone who works for Oracle, they'll tell you their high level of happiness lies in the joy of solving complex problems, and the satisfaction of helping others.\n\nBut of course, what makes our lives meaningful to those who take a very particular view of life is exactly how we live them: doing what we love, pursuing our interests and making things happen. Without real life, there's no \"happiness,\" nor is the notion of it possible to measure.","token_len":605,"entropy":[11.8713,5.6766,2.4655,4.339,0.072,3.9492,2.5874,0.4045,8.1703,3.2639,0.0461,0.548,3.5328,5.0667,11.7384,2.432,10.3703,8.2486,8.5949,1.9182,0.6985,0.0,2.0056,5.6593,1.4305,0.1377,1.3255,1.0872,3.0975,5.4932,1.0602,5.4481,4.7202,4.1878,8.792,4.9349,4.6868,1.2395,4.2749,1.3252,4.5698,0.4727,1.4106,1.7265,1.3894,2.4081,2.5396,1.007,3.9938,0.5578,0.0328,0.8399,2.1692,0.0849,3.8318,5.6501,1.8956,0.5605,3.8146,3.2648,0.5485,2.1368,3.2001,1.8821,4.7889,4.4727,1.4136,4.4861,6.6625,2.6151,1.3811,0.4259,4.0934,3.0901,1.4647,0.5713,0.7184,0.81,0.8138,1.1143,1.7552,1.9815,0.0001,3.207,3.6348,0.9087,1.0826,5.576,2.0234,0.0849,0.5251,5.0084,3.5281,0.3822,4.367,1.089,0.0025,0.0001,4.0265,0.0623,3.7881,1.8289,2.6057,5.5426,0.6228,2.4627,4.1041,1.0923,0.0926,0.0002,1.8993,1.2281,2.1561,3.8301,2.7872,3.316,1.0293,1.36,0.3305,3.061,0.5391,0.3545,1.2979,1.2932,3.3386,1.0804,0.7607,4.9003,0.047,5.6892,5.295,4.4541,2.0217,0.0559,1.7557,1.827,3.6429,2.1468,1.8998,1.3559,0.015,1.1232,0.3217,4.1495,0.6088,1.7809,3.4434,4.5921,0.604,0.2128,1.4416,0.222,3.7632,1.052,4.3062,5.148,0.6863,3.0889,0.1135,1.3144,1.9974,3.6848,0.5913,0.1434,0.7005,1.0587,0.0036,1.6641,2.5646,2.1956,1.7198,1.287,0.7288,4.6745,0.5631,0.2298,6.0499,2.815,0.7988,0.8914,5.9391,0.8775,0.0019,0.0797,5.1892,2.7734,5.2287,3.3883,4.6975,5.8303,2.6482,1.495,5.8035,0.0572,0.1078,0.8442,3.7441,1.7111,2.9894,4.6846,0.5976,1.3722,4.048,0.075,1.8978,2.5396,3.5529,0.2823,0.0892,3.9622,4.9668,0.187,0.2259,0.3941,1.0306,0.0002,0.1594,0.002,4.4076,1.0617,0.9867,5.7835,2.3777,1.4883,0.1908,3.6642,3.1794,0.0181,3.9256,0.9913,1.6305,0.3647,3.3683,1.5068,2.4206,1.953,0.3913,1.7948,4.0341,3.6881,0.2051,3.3976,1.9003,0.5637,0.2915,1.5427,0.8506,0.3014,1.1125,2.8506,0.0002,5.0239,5.3019,2.3359,1.4398,1.7706,0.6375,0.5214,3.645,1.2209,1.4598,0.0002,0.1507,0.0015,3.0227,1.6203,3.4796,0.032,4.3624,6.9497,0.844,6.3718,4.4326,3.0145,1.6349,3.2472,0.457,0.5926,0.2655,2.8988,1.982,1.1733,0.6096,0.3594,2.8173,4.8636,2.065,0.0031,1.5871,3.4135,0.05,1.2197,2.2712,2.867,2.8832,1.6473,1.9008,4.1131,4.625,1.9575,0.8682,3.6798,5.4668,0.6192,0.5893,0.5148,1.6955,1.69,3.0836,0.1497,0.002,0.0053,1.201,4.761,3.1771,1.1597,0.7432,0.5712,1.4607,0.0002,0.6765,0.0015,4.7771,1.7283,0.8883,0.5375,3.6552,2.3662,4.6769,0.2019,3.3133,1.4424,1.2444,1.9082,0.2652,4.9623,3.7847,1.0697,1.5587,5.2544,1.4613,2.0706,0.1323,2.208,0.0288,0.0822,0.44,0.4326,2.2324,5.5172,0.0576,4.5533,2.5134,1.6328,3.1424,4.929,2.3473,0.2784,4.2596,0.1043,0.0901,5.5874,2.1269,1.7751,1.7929,4.9345,5.0824,2.6427,4.511,4.9887,1.433,0.6109,1.3947,1.2232,1.3299,0.003,0.1067,0.4684,0.0002,3.3461,3.4605,3.6628,0.0477,4.3555,0.018,1.3474,1.5758,1.4005,1.3525,1.0069,2.4559,1.9402,1.8421,6.4671,0.2962,1.1538,0.2958,1.7216,2.0818,2.5039,4.3587,2.3794,3.2364,1.2452,0.7476,4.3063,5.8772,0.7846,3.6345,6.0656,4.8047,0.9351,7.1281,0.8337,3.5789,0.032,0.3258,0.4003,3.2961,3.3304,0.745,3.9501,3.5332,5.1979,1.3222,3.003,0.8495,2.0024,3.4661,2.6509,0.4454,1.2399,0.242,6.2058,1.6474,1.275,1.3772,0.6067,1.7107,0.8885,0.0002,4.4094,0.0054,3.6544,2.9205,1.7521,3.7059,0.5776,1.377,5.3665,0.7758,4.9623,0.4728,1.393,1.6892,3.3585,1.1623,0.1554,0.8003,4.4946,3.894,0.6747,4.6937,0.2199,2.6068,1.6699,4.5326,3.0692,5.4862,0.7678,0.6923,2.8619,0.6567,3.0945,1.1134,2.785,4.6357,2.0447,1.1412,5.8095,0.0421,1.0351,1.3628,4.0512,5.5249,0.2921,0.7753,3.4153,0.0184,0.0018,1.8658,1.311,0.6404,0.8934,0.0032,0.8351,2.3838,1.838,6.5701,0.4527,0.687,4.2632,5.2271,6.1605,1.6537,1.2727,4.4311,3.9003,2.2122,0.24,0.3655,2.3312,0.4297,2.65,2.5101,6.2961,0.7805,0.9292,0.1982,0.3263,0.0015,1.983,7.0809,2.4866,0.0632,0.6511,1.6975,0.0994,1.358,4.5336,0.7604,2.4317,1.856,0.378,2.0186,1.2996,1.1646,1.1407,0.3369,2.1664,1.0825,0.9361,1.0368,0.0002,3.4657,5.0619,0.0188,0.6662,3.7641,1.3751,5.8649,1.5087,1.1731,3.5778,4.1182,1.362,5.7662,2.6313,4.3504,4.6863,1.1337,0.0635,2.7664,0.6493,4.9298,2.7549,0.6351,1.6673,0.6392,2.4969,6.0939,1.8476,0.4346,0.4784,0.6863,4.4537,0.7221,1.8736,1.5709,2.9203,3.3728,0.4358,0.4887,5.7846,4.8726,3.2063,1.121,2.1648,0.8406,0.1815,3.2491,0.2886,0.017,2.0517,5.0301,1.4821,4.3447,3.4046,0.1193,1.7469,3.1162,0.7868,0.7618,0.2529]}
{"id":97,"ended":false,"length":597,"gen_text":"To everyone's surprise, Mars One successfully makes it to the red planet. The colonists are thriving while the world watches, until they suffer their first casualty : a homicide victim's daughter. This is the first major development on Mars that we see, and it is already clear that the program did not take everything perfect to the extreme. Mars One have tried to make as much public as possible on the tragedy.\nWith this in mind, we should also not lose sight of the fact that this event, and the subsequent events have still very much humanised the project. The victims and families of this tragedy have been portrayed lovingly with the use of multiple character portraits and a variety of facial expressions. The way in which these characters are portrayed, with their complex emotions, will be an important aspect of the show.\nAs a concept, Mars One is a great one. The idea makes some sense but it is easy to see it being far too ambitious, considering the resources Mars One will be left with, and that there are currently about 700 colonists on Mars. The show has already shown a tremendous amount of care for the public, with a great number of interviews and interviews with the participants. Not to mention the extensive visual effects work done in preparing the event.\nBut it is not all roses for Mars One. First of all, this project also goes so far as to try to get citizens to send in $5. How ambitious! First of all, even if you don't really believe life on the red planet is worth $5, it is still $5. As a result, a lot of people are skeptical of the legitimacy of this project, and of the idea that we could make it to Mars by 2033. But maybe that is what Mars One are trying to do by giving us an incredible show that is entertaining, yet at the same time realistic. I am glad that they are trying, just not sure that they managed to accomplish it fully.\nBut this doesn't invalidate the fact that it is still a wonderful and inspiring show. Mars One has done a great job, depicting what Mars will be like for the thousands of people participating, what they will experience on Mars and what they will get from it. This show will have a lot of things to say about the colonisation process, about what sort of skills you will need to cope with the challenges of the red planet, and about how living in Mars will make you feel. It is likely to be fascinating to see this kind of show made into a movie.\nSo with this, my recap is done. I am definitely not going to make a post dedicated to discussing the merits of this show, but that won't really be necessary! I am going to see it, experience it and talk about it. And I sincerely hope that this show will be well done and will show us a better picture of the future for the people living on Mars, and that the people who are making this show are committed to that mission!

{"id":1349,"ended":true,"length":575,"gen_text":"An alternate history where dogs are wild animals and sea life has been domesticated... and has become more and more similar to the natural world.... I am hoping to play with that for a while.\"\n\n\"People keep saying that humans have changed, that we're more like other life,\" he tells me over coffee in the coffee shop before his event and subsequent speaking engagement.\n\nHe says the idea of \"other life\" includes human and other species. He draws his inspiration for this notion from his childhood, where he was taught about how humans were supposed to behave and how animals would behave. \"I thought that if animals knew how humans worked they'd behave in pretty much the same way we do.\"\n\nWith more than 80 million pets in the U.S., some people have questions about how to raise them responsibly and the implications for animal and human health and welfare. As part of his research, however, Peta finds that many people have similar questions about the ethical treatment of animals in their homes, whether through raising them for food, raising them for fur, breeding them for meat, or keeping them as pets.\n\n\"People are very curious about these issues, but they want to know more about issues like, which animals should be raised for food, what conditions will ensure the highest quality food, breeding standards, the care of pups versus adults, what we should do to ensure they're happy in their new homes. The public is becoming more and more educated that it's important to raise our pets ethically,\" he says. \"You can see that in how many places have mandatory training standards for pets, whether it's training a dog for obedience or training a cat to be housebroken. It's all becoming very popular.\"\n\nPeta recently partnered with the National Association of State Canine Training Offices to host the ASPCA's Animal Control Week 2014 Conference, a two-day academic conference where experts covered everything from food safety to cruelty free pet care, humane education for schools, and law enforcement. The conference garnered some 20,000 attendees from around the United States and Canada, Peta reports.\n\nIt's time for people to \"get informed, do your homework, and get involved\" Peta's mission statement says. There's a lot to be done and there are still a lot of issues we need to address... and many of them are related to how we treat animals.\n\nAt the end of the day, Peta aims for this: to provide tools that empower people by helping them avoid making ill-informed decisions and providing training so they can practice responsible care when it's time to take their animal to a vet. But even just talking about these issues is a start. It's time for people to \"get informed, do your homework, and get involved\" Peta's mission statement says. There's a lot to be done and there are still a lot of issues we need to address\u2014from how we treat animals to how we treat each other.","token_len":607,"entropy":[6.9299,4.7258,2.3071,9.9669,1.8228,7.3656,2.9447,1.7671,8.5936,3.8641,2.9294,1.8297,5.2513,0.0008,5.881,2.9254,4.3443,2.7556,4.0062,3.3122,0.0027,4.9456,0.1438,2.0726,5.1065,0.4251,5.5421,4.1318,3.6492,4.5497,1.1298,5.2858,1.3261,2.0113,3.79,1.0582,0.8635,2.9187,0.5106,0.0157,3.0418,6.6822,4.3902,1.9637,1.3313,4.278,2.2788,3.4227,2.3623,2.0592,0.902,1.6267,2.5085,2.5656,3.196,4.8875,5.9046,1.9891,4.5162,1.1253,3.0061,3.6098,1.1394,1.918,4.8003,0.261,6.0415,2.4529,5.2662,6.3643,5.1237,4.5101,0.7073,0.6199,3.1724,0.0002,3.2369,2.8936,2.4355,3.0858,1.4369,2.5,4.5215,0.1945,0.0447,5.6302,4.7083,3.2712,3.1384,2.6924,1.2798,2.41,5.889,3.9022,1.5073,1.7963,1.42,4.222,0.1146,2.1006,2.9039,1.2572,2.5491,0.3738,2.0771,2.4409,2.0273,3.2384,2.4314,2.5863,4.2316,0.0021,1.4825,2.4351,2.0603,2.5394,4.155,1.0246,0.7948,1.7424,1.2366,3.441,1.5589,2.5235,2.2434,4.0819,1.3547,1.1958,4.3609,3.0523,1.3099,1.7148,1.5935,5.6599,0.1641,0.0608,0.0395,0.0797,4.1748,0.3574,1.4567,0.2541,0.0002,5.6537,5.7096,0.7187,4.6645,3.1972,3.9165,0.6882,0.2348,1.1885,0.001,0.0031,0.7463,4.7982,2.4128,2.4871,5.5632,0.2198,1.3351,2.0005,3.1214,1.5524,2.4945,2.1403,4.5084,4.694,2.165,2.7439,5.4594,0.2909,1.1462,2.2548,1.2657,0.1494,4.6144,3.5224,0.0015,0.7266,3.0083,0.3523,5.878,0.0045,5.6386,1.696,5.1766,0.6837,2.3994,1.1464,2.4254,4.1175,1.5883,0.6063,2.2231,3.8039,1.1415,0.0334,1.159,2.4902,2.0116,1.5158,1.8295,2.8186,4.613,2.7743,1.0342,1.6279,0.2304,0.6878,3.4092,0.1282,0.5446,2.3547,0.5222,2.5897,0.104,0.7504,2.1433,0.4075,0.4055,2.7959,0.1015,0.7258,0.3222,0.1003,0.3969,0.0003,1.5463,2.1367,1.5876,3.0233,2.6173,0.3505,3.0427,0.9013,1.5297,1.5137,1.0132,3.477,0.6174,0.7302,2.3451,1.3129,6.5344,1.5638,4.6949,6.7153,1.0397,1.5913,0.9948,2.2225,0.575,0.1579,0.9236,2.5547,5.3474,5.0406,4.6518,1.7651,3.0259,0.7341,2.1213,1.1072,6.3957,2.4076,0.5018,3.6047,4.1235,0.4576,6.4406,0.0635,6.7937,0.6073,0.4613,2.327,4.5252,1.1994,0.3563,1.9919,2.0159,4.0267,0.8807,2.2779,3.5052,0.4522,1.3928,0.4089,2.9845,3.7292,4.8659,1.0751,5.121,0.7337,1.2131,0.0008,2.909,5.9832,3.0275,0.3145,1.4156,0.221,2.3381,2.3065,1.4063,2.1532,0.0001,1.5499,0.9206,0.2371,0.0595,1.7903,5.1416,1.2032,2.5121,1.2788,1.5885,3.0604,2.1673,5.8354,2.3103,4.3275,4.2183,2.1698,0.894,3.3746,1.6296,3.7048,0.4025,0.1052,3.9331,1.9705,0.5413,1.3518,1.1356,0.5238,1.5874,0.4116,0.5081,1.6961,1.6522,1.7916,0.1299,1.048,2.656,0.2245,3.6238,3.0979,3.6205,3.017,0.7093,0.0352,0.0002,3.8571,0.3354,4.4478,3.8558,0.0116,1.1386,3.4784,2.7597,0.1717,3.2259,2.7658,0.0096,2.1659,2.7305,0.0014,0.8393,4.2971,2.1659,5.3198,0.0003,0.952,2.7781,6.2897,4.2147,4.6606,3.01,1.4827,2.2733,2.35,0.0289,0.034,6.7576,0.9706,3.8586,2.7772,6.3758,2.4921,0.0513,4.7462,0.7478,0.4628,4.7317,6.3663,0.2556,0.786,2.6055,4.9263,0.7424,3.9263,2.9267,0.4761,0.6013,5.6503,0.082,1.7337,2.132,0.7574,5.8954,3.9422,4.3884,0.0229,0.0112,0.341,1.9239,2.1269,0.0092,3.944,0.0016,1.3416,0.6077,1.3036,2.5233,0.0004,0.9056,0.173,0.2908,0.0002,4.4229,0.8341,5.7641,1.0492,2.2319,0.1044,3.1135,1.7574,3.5072,2.5505,4.5033,1.6409,1.3372,0.3764,0.4738,2.8888,1.0177,2.6028,2.4507,0.0002,1.4067,6.1194,0.1218,1.3528,0.1951,5.4867,1.0943,1.3155,0.8881,1.4084,2.0855,0.7366,3.5043,3.0309,1.2061,4.4738,1.5395,0.0788,0.0664,2.9634,3.9006,0.7664,0.0408,1.4247,6.9915,2.5008,4.291,1.2108,0.9145,0.9882,2.7362,0.0162,2.7743,0.4198,0.5008,0.6142,0.55,0.6877,0.0002,5.084,0.7035,2.6861,0.0029,0.7374,0.3285,0.1245,1.3579,0.002,5.3222,3.8708,4.9369,1.8514,3.9356,4.0106,4.7194,2.4777,2.6145,0.3722,6.1317,2.2098,0.1198,5.8839,3.3442,5.0141,0.0854,0.413,0.5592,1.9672,4.5163,4.8266,3.675,1.4403,0.3759,5.3779,2.2249,2.9758,3.5243,2.0675,1.1706,0.8721,0.165,1.5133,0.9879,3.1058,2.0619,0.9192,1.2093,0.4551,4.4423,3.921,4.9424,3.0834,0.2248,1.6175,0.2509,1.6382,1.3478,1.7586,0.4513,3.3125,0.4495,0.8267,0.0831,0.0699,0.0113,0.0635,0.0023,0.0027,0.022,0.0015,0.0073,0.0,0.0146,0.0011,0.0005,0.0011,1.372,0.2233,0.0,0.0293,0.0014,0.0004,0.007,0.0163,0.1972,0.0032,0.0021,0.0004,0.0009,0.0005,0.0002,0.003,0.0013,0.0011,0.0005,0.001,0.0009,0.0005,0.0008,0.0014,0.0006,0.0007,0.0051,4.349,2.4703,2.8487,0.3025,0.2773,0.1796,0.4472,0.9026,0.0901,0.5194,0.6457,0.0036,0.3606]}
{"id":4092,"ended":false,"length":544,"gen_text":"Everyday, you daydream of a world unlike your own. One where things are not so different, but not quite the same either. Every night you dream of this world, you live inside of it. One day, you wake up to find this world is your new reality.\n\nDaydreaming in the everyday is not something that only teenagers do\n\nDaydreaming in the everyday has been studied in numerous studies.\n\nWhile everyone has dreams about what it would be like to change the world, those who have been bullied or are dealing with trauma are more aware of the ways in which they can affect the world and others.\n\nI was told by people who were victims of violence that daydreaming helped them deal with the trauma of daily life\n\nIn a review of the research, Daydreaming and Social Cognition: Social Cognition, theories of consciousness, and social cognition theory by Patricia L. Quinn, Ph.D., a psychologist from George Mason University, found that the ability to experience and recall daydreams is linked to increased social intelligence.\n\nIn other words, there is evidence that those who have been victims of bullying have been able to develop positive social connections with other adults. Also, those who have been able to identify emotions feel confident and can better regulate those emotions by daydreaming about them.\n\nPeople are very social beings\n\nHumans are social creatures. Our ability to organize and coordinate the activities occurring in our minds is what makes us who we are.\n\nIn fact, the study by Todorov, found that we are able to organize and coordinate our thoughts and feelings, even at the deepest levels, due to the fact that we are socially organized like a machine. By daydreaming about our daily lives we are using brain wave frequencies that have been historically associated with social interaction.\n\nWe live in this ordinary world\n\nAs my little girl used to laugh at me when I talked about my dreams and hopes of what the future may hold, I always looked for different ways of helping those with dreams of a different world.\n\nFrom personal experience, it is one thing to dream of what it was like to be an astronaut or a princess. Other people have said that they, too, dreamed of being an astronaut or a princess.\n\nThere is power in a little bit of imagination. Daydreaming about a different world can be a way of imagining a new day.\n\nI started talking to students in my special education classes about daydreaming and ways we can improve our lives to better prepare ourselves for the future. Even today I'm encouraged to share with others, my daydreams.\n\nFor people who are currently living in the everyday and have dreams that run contrary to what they want, there are so many more things to do everyday and everyday to believe in the power of a little bit more imagination.\n\nSo, I invite you to join me in daydreaming daily.

Or so you thought, until a strange person acknowledged your presence and addressed you specifically. \"\n\nIt was only then that Shibuya's real life became real to her because of the person in front of her.\n\nThe day you woke up to the sound of a new radio station, but you quickly took that as an opportunity to go right to sleep before it changed and turned into the noise of an empty room.\n\nThe day where you looked at the clock to find that you're now two-thirds behind, only to be startled from that by your mother coming into the room and asking if you knew where you were.\n\nThe day with your classmate the student council president, who is your love interest, asking what kind of things your dream is to do together with your classmate the student council vice-president.\n\nYou find yourself wondering if you really got the job because your teacher said, \" Shibuya-kei \"\n\nYou have a crush on his friends, but it wouldn't make any difference because you're a third-year and can feel for no one in particular.\n\nYou wonder if you're a failure.\n\nYou find yourself staring at the ceiling, wondering if you'll ever get out of the school because you're only now realizing how your love for him had been completely blind.\n\nYou don 't want to fall in love, but the feelings you feel for this boy make it unbearable that you can't find anyone else.\n\nYou are the kind of person who can't stand it when you're treated differently from other people because you have no memories of the outside world, but you're so in love with this boy that you can't stop thinking that your feelings are real.\n\nYou're not as coldhearted as most do, but despite being in love you can't bring yourself to act for someone because you'd rather be alone.\n\nYou have been through so much and you can 't stand the thought of letting any of it go.\n\nYou want to escape, but not even Shibuya offers you a place away from reality.\n\nYou have been having such mixed feelings all these years about this feeling, but you have tried your best to ignore it.\n\nYou cannot bear to be with anyone who doesn't think just as you do about you, because no one can ever really want you the way you do.\n\nNo one knows who you, Shibuya, are, because no one knows what you felt that day when you were five years old and your parents held you after they had heard of your

{"id":1029,"ended":true,"length":572,"gen_text":"Write a story with every line from a different character's perspective.\n\n. Write a story with every line from a different character's perspective. Create a short story with all the lines from the same fictional character.\n\n. Create a short story with all the lines from the same fictional character. Create a short story with all of the lines from different characters's perspectives.\n\nIt is a very good idea to draw out your options and then give them to a story writer.\n\nFor example :\n\nWrite two short stories with one line each. Write two short stories with three lines each. Write two short stories with eight lines each. Write two short stories with one long line per character. Write a story with everything except the lines from one character.\n\nThe story writer will start with the most unlikely option first and work away from there until you find something that satisfies everyone, and that you think will make the story interesting.\n\nHow many different characters are there?\n\nThere may be hundreds of different options for a character. Think about the many possibilities in a story, like who you could have a relationship with, how you might be related to another character, or what circumstances might have caused your character to get the part in the first place. You then will want to pick a line from one of these possibilities to link your story with.\n\nIf you do the same thing over and over again, it could get boring as they become the same three lines from different characters each time you write it. By making sure that you use the option that is most interesting to you then you can add a freshness and interest to your story.\n\nNote : It is important to create a little more flexibility in the lines yourself than your story writer will allow. It is important to give yourself freedom to take different approaches to the characters so that you can choose the best options. If it is too easy for the story to be about the protagonist, it may not be interesting for other characters.\n\nFor example :\n\nWrite a story with two characters: one who has the same parent and the other who has a different parent. Have them grow up without having a parent, and be friends for a while. The one who has the one parent will give the other character a speech about his\/her father, but we will not ever see the son. The story writer may want to insert this scene.\n\nWriting lines, lines, lines...\n\nSo it is time to actually write the short stories and then work on the longer ones. You need good writers and a good draft, but without the right preparation time it may take a very long time before all of these long stories are finished.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that it is never \"too late\" to write a story.\n\nYou can always take a little break to revise and start again if you feel like it.\n\nWhen the story is complete, write a comment explaining why you think it is good.","token_len":609,"entropy":[3.5497,4.0087,5.1327,8.6121,4.5049,4.2714,2.5541,5.8326,3.7268,2.1802,2.1863,0.7717,1.3501,0.0071,7.2874,2.7078,0.237,0.2866,0.3267,0.0223,0.0007,0.0014,0.0016,0.0004,0.0003,0.0006,0.0008,0.0011,3.6751,0.4704,3.1324,0.8139,1.7973,3.9489,1.063,2.1738,0.2944,1.9809,1.3271,7.8857,0.1918,0.9706,0.11,0.0002,2.4646,0.4518,0.0727,0.1439,0.01,0.0725,0.0393,0.0048,0.0021,0.0024,0.0142,0.0035,0.0079,0.0005,0.0019,1.6959,0.1877,0.9283,0.066,0.3592,0.5788,3.8406,0.1452,0.1055,0.1034,2.1356,0.9983,5.3448,0.3849,0.0813,0.083,0.0002,5.6481,2.4367,2.4668,3.4043,2.8856,0.7107,0.0647,5.6369,3.0783,1.9218,6.621,1.9657,3.1034,5.0818,1.4926,1.1298,1.9137,4.1086,3.4106,0.7564,1.8161,0.0002,3.9598,0.4124,7.1202,0.6224,0.0002,2.7425,5.1249,1.51,0.0797,1.1102,3.087,2.0397,0.8607,1.1554,2.1893,1.6567,0.317,0.0087,0.1112,2.801,0.0573,0.032,0.0355,0.3897,0.6157,0.0656,0.0033,0.0321,4.5616,0.0154,0.026,0.0273,0.7093,0.4942,0.0648,0.0037,0.0388,3.0313,5.5295,0.1013,4.6675,0.7092,0.1761,0.8764,1.9371,2.106,0.3656,5.209,3.4738,0.6664,2.5871,0.5089,1.4652,0.2269,0.5604,0.625,0.0002,2.8815,3.2316,0.4403,0.6176,5.3073,1.295,0.7058,2.9078,4.8835,3.1858,1.9729,1.276,1.6741,6.4036,0.2641,1.1315,2.1321,2.6097,2.2614,1.4774,0.7534,5.8956,4.7969,4.3827,1.8171,2.7591,1.8054,3.1998,1.7453,2.7158,1.4075,0.5915,2.414,0.4708,0.1695,0.0002,4.3938,3.1671,2.8673,2.0217,2.6098,0.6129,1.5297,0.2295,0.0002,1.9901,4.6908,0.1745,2.6456,0.4505,1.3641,4.0991,1.3312,1.6277,1.3808,1.4332,5.3376,0.7745,1.6376,4.3666,2.2667,3.8903,2.0405,1.7474,2.2273,4.4983,4.8233,2.7124,2.4311,2.161,1.9661,2.0901,0.0097,0.5995,2.2515,0.8933,2.3587,2.4245,2.7798,0.3118,2.7749,0.1782,0.3268,1.8239,1.4193,5.0922,1.1733,2.2547,2.635,2.5401,0.8724,0.1021,4.1782,2.5311,4.2575,2.3879,0.3097,0.3939,0.0011,0.0562,4.0502,6.1987,5.2,3.1186,0.0371,3.4539,1.5515,4.3485,1.3175,2.3091,0.2524,1.3772,1.3857,1.6027,5.8003,1.3761,1.3154,1.6374,2.9549,0.2649,0.0002,3.0473,0.4514,4.3448,3.6996,1.1114,1.0403,5.8047,0.056,0.0038,0.6134,0.4484,2.5858,3.7464,1.7392,2.4335,5.6955,3.8467,2.4255,1.5639,0.0689,6.2115,0.8951,3.2691,2.0481,0.193,3.4197,0.0448,2.3482,1.4419,1.2897,0.1379,5.7354,4.1588,2.8741,1.0353,1.2706,3.5686,1.7265,5.2599,0.5406,1.5857,0.6053,1.5359,0.4461,0.1558,5.2842,0.3422,1.5682,4.2426,1.7768,3.3763,3.4029,1.724,2.4767,0.1318,0.3263,0.9359,0.336,0.1367,0.0002,5.6048,1.0808,3.0511,0.3976,2.1128,0.3311,4.7802,1.059,5.8761,3.065,5.3661,0.8273,1.6553,3.6786,6.3943,2.7809,4.3733,0.173,0.3329,1.1162,1.6459,0.5914,3.0731,0.3997,2.8441,0.373,3.2494,1.2624,3.7115,0.6552,5.0951,2.5683,2.5407,0.6927,1.3566,2.9435,4.0398,0.3339,0.4372,0.5384,4.5799,1.3339,1.5763,3.8068,1.899,3.2228,4.4574,0.6032,2.1046,1.8324,1.2016,1.2733,0.1901,1.6748,1.5295,2.5996,1.3013,3.9961,1.3613,1.9354,1.8528,0.7912,0.283,1.3418,1.7385,3.4296,0.5256,0.781,0.6118,0.0002,4.1507,0.1339,0.3088,0.1767,0.0002,0.9456,0.8574,0.7447,0.5398,2.699,1.3945,4.7042,1.9963,1.908,2.2754,3.0208,1.7273,6.0032,1.6208,1.874,0.0583,0.2365,0.7995,0.8204,0.2225,0.2764,0.0825,5.4855,2.1346,3.7961,0.0586,5.5117,3.9214,1.6416,2.141,3.1138,1.4065,4.8849,2.6958,2.0734,1.0228,0.9111,0.4052,3.6177,3.7928,0.5917,0.2105,0.7908,6.7216,0.2594,1.527,5.2176,1.0835,0.5326,0.3967,1.1722,5.0515,1.3383,3.1136,1.9167,0.0118,3.2537,1.4581,2.5308,5.9675,1.456,1.7138,6.3919,0.4891,1.1068,4.4591,2.1933,2.2571,2.2983,1.105,1.9444,2.7424,0.4442,5.2562,2.8162,2.3691,3.1784,0.8809,0.0002,4.634,4.9236,5.6899,2.9028,0.3964,0.1718,3.3065,0.1805,0.0002,4.3374,4.6888,0.8532,1.3227,0.1292,3.7239,0.3289,0.8811,6.0149,1.1688,2.9225,3.7432,4.5615,1.771,0.7293,0.8902,0.9327,0.2237,2.9514,2.8452,7.6585,5.4961,2.5011,2.091,0.6123,5.6141,2.8059,1.5279,5.9167,1.8786,1.5917,3.8593,2.9101,1.6562,2.9602,2.6921,1.6398,2.7967,0.0173,0.0078,1.8936,6.0351,1.8709,3.61,5.2599,0.445,0.6419,1.3749,0.1714,0.3359,0.0002,2.4933,3.6372,3.3526,0.809,0.1503,0.3509,0.4862,2.8313,0.3017,4.2298,5.9518,0.9882,0.7091,0.2516,0.0723,1.9266,1.1571,0.4957,0.3626,2.2435,0.0002,2.4902,0.8979,1.7284,3.8707,1.2448,3.1092,2.404,2.5389,4.3511,2.0089,5.2287,0.5465,2.6496,0.367,2.0039,1.4004,0.6774,0.2654,0.9068,0.0002,3.9045,3.5944,1.1846,0.3547,2.6972,0.7183,3.9072,0.7396,5.7831,2.8454,1.1863,0.5203,1.8868,0.3946,0.6848,1.6949,0.9076]}

There are so many colours and each important but you were the first born with yellow eyes. You are our protector against dark magic. The earth belongs to us and we are the guardians because of you.\n\n\nI did feel sorry for those that did not have that special gene, it meant that everything could change. My daughter has been chosen for this job.\n\n\nI did not believe when the magician said he made your face and name and he wanted to put you in the box, he wanted to make the new world because you have changed it.\n\n\nI knew that one thing would happen if you would stay in the old box, I was afraid.\n\n\nThen one day I did not want any one to know about it. I found the box inside a small box, it was small and I found this little piece of paper inside. There were symbols inside. I opened the little piece of paper and it said, there is someone inside here and the box. It said : This box is very important because it contains the key to the whole creation. This paper is very dangerous to give out. I asked a magician who was inside the box about it and he showed me everything I needed to know.\n\n\nThe paper came from the sky. It was the most beautiful thing in the whole creation. I will send you a picture.\n\n\nI was the first sent and I had always done what my father wanted but I had no desire to let him down. The magician always loved me and thought that I was the most powerful wizard to come out of my country, because of me the dark world is controlled.\n\n\nThis magician was the one who had made you, so he knew everything. I felt very angry at my father when I found the box. I was mad at my father and could not forgive him for taking me away.\n\n\nIf I did not love you for this secret you will not remember what you did with me.\n\n\nYou said you never wanted to hurt anyone, you just wanted good for the people. I did not want your love, because I was not a good girl.\n\n\nI did not want any of the dark magic that you could do with me, even as you wished. For some time my father put his dark magic inside me, I could feel it in my bones and I remember it, I felt that something bad is happening.\n\n\nAfter many years, the first child grew up. She was not with anyone, she did not love anyone but herself, not because someone needed her, but because she was lonely...\n\n\nOne day that child told me she was alone and I asked her : How does it feel to be a very lonely child? But she just said that she could not tell me. It was a secret because she did not want anyone to look for her, she was afraid that one day they would take her away from me.","token_len":609,"entropy":[7.9511,7.0307,6.4012,5.4409,0.9337,5.9738,10.9921,5.1153,7.373,0.8751,2.0049,3.3134,0.6378,2.6106,0.4538,4.2585,1.4222,0.3617,0.9821,1.4604,4.1097,0.9526,4.2158,0.035,1.8569,2.3745,4.6115,8.4708,6.1885,2.9142,8.3147,5.1604,1.4283,8.0525,3.6224,5.3735,0.9987,0.9311,1.809,1.8058,5.5587,4.4769,3.5955,4.3579,1.9043,0.9457,3.4245,4.8871,4.4559,0.0231,1.4541,1.3871,1.0677,1.573,1.0121,2.3621,7.2503,2.058,1.7365,0.3019,3.9631,0.0002,3.3539,6.077,6.6847,3.1216,0.1955,4.0884,2.8019,2.4402,0.0732,0.7181,4.5262,2.9114,5.6153,2.0298,3.7356,3.9064,1.2894,5.6871,3.4996,3.8709,1.7252,4.2797,5.2255,2.8761,3.7171,5.0461,1.9638,2.273,2.7574,1.5628,2.4531,0.0002,1.9324,4.0236,0.9692,4.049,4.7889,2.146,6.0404,1.4573,2.7509,4.9683,4.4238,5.0768,2.5763,4.916,3.0782,4.5968,4.5667,0.6358,4.1757,1.5009,0.7554,0.957,4.2098,2.4504,2.6206,2.5288,0.3434,1.9542,3.1443,5.4514,1.4963,4.2796,2.2443,3.2649,4.1989,2.8563,0.9043,0.9855,0.0003,1.3697,4.0921,1.4729,4.5868,6.5092,2.0691,0.9931,2.7799,1.0795,4.142,3.2116,0.9121,0.5061,5.9054,4.2079,1.1753,3.0545,2.4854,2.2699,2.1166,1.0607,0.0002,4.8303,3.4861,0.3403,1.2627,4.1914,0.7873,2.4075,5.0007,5.4598,0.5569,1.7589,1.9666,1.9825,1.2444,0.7052,4.8775,2.1392,1.0661,6.0163,1.5973,3.7583,2.4472,2.4096,2.2785,0.3366,2.64,0.878,2.0943,3.4893,4.6464,2.8886,3.6152,0.2304,0.6709,1.8255,0.9046,4.4744,1.776,5.1411,4.3304,1.8963,1.0828,2.9756,0.8084,1.9397,2.1495,0.0724,0.0123,0.43,2.2567,1.2793,2.4576,4.8506,0.6667,4.245,2.7085,4.4166,2.6699,3.5294,2.4898,3.6921,2.7593,1.4914,8.2675,5.2056,2.3552,0.6545,4.0502,1.8873,3.2575,1.1094,1.7679,1.1052,2.4094,0.5085,0.9327,3.8291,4.9831,0.5861,3.1231,5.0976,1.2528,1.7498,4.4031,2.8721,5.8462,2.0662,1.8041,1.9276,4.6046,3.6423,2.8994,2.6887,1.264,4.2848,0.6878,0.1723,3.449,1.0302,1.0293,0.1067,5.0811,0.087,5.4382,2.5098,1.1163,0.1648,0.1535,0.4064,1.2302,0.0003,2.5204,3.2034,5.7912,0.809,0.9044,4.7038,1.3812,1.528,0.9941,2.0674,4.0745,1.4131,2.21,2.439,0.1293,1.2152,1.9603,0.385,1.8032,4.5428,4.7881,0.7529,2.3801,2.4698,1.8039,0.824,0.0002,1.3311,2.9205,3.1975,0.9972,6.4823,2.6085,1.094,3.3825,6.1036,5.9113,2.2343,3.4456,1.447,1.322,4.5571,1.1009,2.2037,2.3317,5.8082,0.326,6.2427,1.0592,1.1048,0.2271,3.5814,1.7892,6.1654,4.7796,0.185,1.0026,5.6093,1.3926,0.4502,0.5869,1.5155,1.0608,4.302,5.0482,4.5851,2.0704,2.5254,0.1405,3.079,1.7615,2.7638,3.2876,1.7264,2.9542,3.3516,4.6901,3.5491,2.4627,4.8551,0.7705,0.9735,0.0003,4.2982,3.2905,2.0914,2.0327,1.6778,0.4683,2.7093,3.0749,2.94,3.2581,3.58,1.8136,2.2458,0.6509,1.4972,2.0508,4.1446,2.8991,4.3297,2.663,2.9702,0.1412,2.966,0.8392,1.3889,2.1804,1.2709,0.8811,0.9588,1.9097,5.0703,0.9158,2.5259,0.1126,2.1112,5.5284,0.1615,3.8887,0.0856,1.0137,3.7582,1.2309,0.8909,2.0133,1.0579,0.0003,5.3137,1.3988,2.8993,0.081,5.2398,1.0337,5.6311,4.1401,4.8708,3.4657,3.039,2.0984,3.9954,3.3924,2.527,2.0322,3.5211,0.5129,0.4736,0.9672,0.0003,2.8788,4.6551,1.6664,4.7948,1.0498,0.3361,2.6776,1.81,1.196,2.7921,3.4094,0.2486,7.1324,1.5784,1.7313,2.2516,0.8751,1.4962,2.7432,0.2365,1.5389,4.1329,3.346,2.0535,3.2523,0.9551,1.9304,2.1581,2.3697,0.5635,2.6957,0.6628,1.084,0.0003,0.9009,2.3971,0.2156,0.7957,3.9896,2.5562,1.6103,2.8636,0.3528,2.3998,1.7111,3.8456,0.9643,2.4007,0.8569,1.245,4.5801,5.954,2.4129,5.8002,0.9255,6.224,3.9407,1.8633,4.2399,0.7489,5.5715,4.3646,3.6231,0.2118,2.0271,0.5988,1.7004,1.8544,2.2035,1.8687,0.463,2.7364,0.4029,2.5449,1.6636,1.3463,5.8118,1.3041,3.6855,1.639,2.3695,4.0199,3.7597,2.2637,2.7426,1.2783,1.3655,0.6714,0.0002,4.6438,2.9907,0.5398,2.1454,2.2932,5.1412,4.3956,5.9972,0.5457,1.5044,1.922,0.6932,2.8118,6.0212,4.9178,1.5033,0.7168,2.3432,0.1666,3.6466,0.3151,3.1244,2.2363,2.4139,4.7973,4.2098,5.1022,4.9179,0.2177,0.8946,0.652,0.2784,0.2668,1.24,3.6703,7.1595,1.0035,0.0002,3.5021,0.2037,6.5082,1.2486,2.494,0.4686,2.4278,1.4212,4.4611,1.2438,1.9768,2.3048,0.2779,3.475,4.0082,4.7917,0.2841,0.1401,0.7184,0.1909,3.8163,4.9463,2.197,0.726,0.7438,5.6451,0.3065,3.6634,1.5324,1.9591,0.6767,3.2288,0.2758,2.102,0.146,1.3495,4.2862,0.589,2.3417,2.4872,5.1189,0.953,1.6275,0.0325,0.2464,1.3406,0.1504,7.3391,1.2258,0.3331,1.9593,1.3434,1.6396,0.792,1.7023,3.9379,0.0525,2.9916,0.3813,3.4357,0.0539,0.3297,1.1736,0.173,0.3969]}
{"id":2500,"ended":true,"length":574,"gen_text":"You are granted two wishes, the first one you use to grant yourself immortality, the second one you wish for your soul mate to have immortality too. Now all you have to do is find them.\n\n\"It was in the year 2210 of the solar system age\n\nthat a strange man with short hair and a white beard was born to a poor peasant girl in the poor town of Mestor. The girl's name was Maria, and she was of age before she was born. The man before he was named, and his parents were Maria's parents.\n\nThe man named, and his parents was named his god, and it was Maria's god name that he was named the king. While he was growing up Maria loved him very much.\n\nOne day the man's god fell asleep, and now his girl's God was still sleeping inside of her, the girl began to suffer from some kind of mental disorders. But she didn't really know what she was and what she was doing, it was just there in her mind, and now Maria's girl's mind was growing more and more warped.\n\nFinally the girl's mind reached a state of total bliss, and for the first time in Maria's life began to manifest the fullness of her potential. From then on Maria began to manifest the fullness of her power. It was then Maria fell in love with the man named, but he had already had a girlfriend so Maria was already in love with another girl, the girl who would prove the most difficult thing for Maria.\n\nAnd that girl was called Mestor. The girl had an IQ of 120 and a GPA of 5.0. It was very difficult for Maria to talk to her because she would always end up stammering in a mess of incoherent speech. Mestor would respond with the most logical and logical answers, and sometimes they would even get the same response.\n\nThe young girls soul mate fell in love with Maria because she was different from her. The only thing that she had in common with her was her height, and this is when Maria began to feel like she did have something in common with her soul mate.\n\nThere was one thing the girl would never do, the girl was too stubborn to allow herself to do the wish you wished for, and if you said it to her you could not do anything about it, you had to actually try to do it on your own. This is because if you did do it on your own you would not be able to save her from becoming her mother again.\n\nBut Maria thought about this and she wondered if her soul mate was the same thing. Did they both want to die? Were they both dead to Mestor? One day Maria told her soul mate about this all of a sudden. And the man was shocked. It dawned on him that he was never the same person he was, he was never the same person before they started to develop soul mates.","token_len":610,"entropy":[3.0403,7.4732,4.3083,2.9479,1.6845,3.047,0.3291,2.9109,3.8069,5.6789,1.9271,3.3671,0.9563,3.8003,1.3875,0.9641,0.255,0.8506,1.7133,5.3148,1.2553,2.691,4.8962,4.5006,1.1384,1.9892,4.7116,2.5794,0.4017,4.5029,4.5811,0.5515,0.6438,0.0281,0.0187,0.0702,2.3709,2.638,1.5183,1.3807,0.0136,4.1054,3.7763,2.7852,4.3966,1.0593,4.4267,5.1124,2.765,2.352,0.2363,5.6659,0.5064,6.1407,7.8036,0.0002,1.3227,1.6135,4.5488,3.1615,3.4585,5.4195,1.6604,1.0386,1.0157,3.8397,0.9557,3.309,2.2566,2.8584,0.5814,2.0197,3.1169,3.0737,1.6845,0.9108,5.8675,2.2418,0.1488,4.818,4.8614,3.82,0.6418,2.603,2.0282,1.393,0.6182,0.1195,5.7016,1.6082,0.7837,0.9462,0.5982,4.5924,6.3043,5.7085,0.889,0.9191,1.0662,0.3122,2.354,0.8074,7.2853,4.3156,0.7477,2.2802,4.4467,2.6964,1.9952,3.3706,1.3114,5.0817,0.5496,1.5563,0.3397,1.1756,0.0001,1.8435,0.727,4.0391,4.1793,1.7241,0.6718,0.2902,5.6315,2.2065,3.9875,4.5092,2.4258,0.7396,3.7596,0.3004,5.4442,0.1448,0.3374,4.1724,1.5748,1.0694,2.1866,1.4671,4.0384,5.3666,1.3781,6.4931,1.327,0.2209,1.7259,0.0733,3.5597,3.426,0.9621,1.4564,0.1425,1.5581,2.1874,0.0001,1.8781,0.1868,1.9042,1.0651,2.1356,3.066,5.3313,3.9331,1.2846,0.2784,5.6405,3.3848,5.8043,2.4561,4.9608,1.024,4.8497,1.4081,5.1409,1.222,0.4022,1.7087,4.103,0.9564,4.9577,0.1384,3.8967,0.486,4.5061,1.8721,0.0092,3.3478,5.6409,0.8631,4.2202,2.1282,2.4945,0.0031,4.4121,1.0728,0.4467,2.4849,0.2622,5.3114,1.6489,0.96,0.4242,1.3917,1.8301,3.5591,0.572,2.4733,6.1613,2.9355,0.3139,0.9383,1.6336,1.422,3.9374,2.3991,2.1791,4.0582,1.2588,3.4481,0.6473,3.9422,2.1695,0.4301,0.0017,5.7033,1.0803,0.6806,0.0002,5.2547,1.7245,0.3999,1.4614,1.2413,4.2937,1.3067,3.2586,0.8901,3.9355,5.8264,0.6994,0.8705,5.2404,0.4817,0.0926,0.0167,0.552,3.7125,0.0089,0.2191,7.2545,0.1128,5.6614,2.2513,4.2153,3.5676,0.0332,0.1884,4.19,0.5517,5.7066,1.7496,0.0879,1.2007,1.8579,0.0978,2.2828,1.472,0.8326,0.5072,0.0244,0.0829,3.3035,1.3517,4.1544,0.4866,2.1249,2.0091,5.8673,0.4431,0.0097,0.1314,0.8036,0.4241,1.9063,1.9564,3.7316,2.1877,2.9798,3.1884,3.6527,0.9497,1.4886,5.3829,1.7226,2.1398,3.4778,1.9013,0.2758,0.1835,1.9194,3.1349,2.0749,2.8161,0.8657,2.7348,1.5526,7.067,3.741,1.7791,1.5627,3.5591,0.9258,0.669,2.0056,0.3755,0.0002,3.863,2.3697,0.2321,0.2723,2.9183,5.3261,1.3729,0.0422,0.8063,3.753,0.6902,2.9644,4.3337,5.2059,0.2291,3.9705,1.4759,1.7592,3.8392,0.0333,3.5349,0.152,0.9694,0.7671,4.4884,0.2968,4.3033,1.4028,0.3447,0.3335,0.1749,3.4591,0.1122,1.0897,2.3117,1.0276,2.8381,2.5769,4.6475,0.0618,4.5389,1.7171,0.0009,0.0006,4.4229,1.2835,5.4175,0.2253,3.5116,0.0795,3.4996,0.4972,2.954,0.0016,0.0019,2.7038,5.2144,1.3499,3.0673,2.3807,4.1653,1.6459,2.7606,1.6303,1.2101,1.2669,4.1766,2.9433,0.4073,1.4067,2.8058,2.9406,1.8453,4.0979,1.3403,1.2116,0.0002,2.3332,6.3127,4.4163,4.4976,0.311,5.2378,0.2848,0.0057,0.0401,0.8172,3.3849,1.1077,0.5527,5.2273,0.7307,2.5016,1.5454,2.4483,3.7518,1.2361,0.99,2.5811,1.2463,0.4444,0.004,0.06,1.574,0.1991,2.0522,4.0997,0.7708,1.193,4.2183,3.2383,3.463,1.2235,2.1661,0.1009,2.9097,2.759,0.7399,4.8199,4.0347,1.7707,0.5267,0.0077,0.0861,0.9177,1.3496,0.0094,0.4174,1.0175,0.0002,5.1882,0.4766,1.3869,1.2484,3.2667,1.3134,4.3583,1.5808,1.5056,0.6597,3.5772,0.8281,2.3021,4.5655,3.4157,0.8431,3.8104,1.6962,0.0365,4.4358,2.8299,5.9358,5.9746,2.7138,0.2885,1.3393,1.5789,4.3865,1.3342,4.1367,2.1305,1.8585,0.2407,2.9124,2.3049,1.9442,3.2733,2.1252,0.7905,0.0178,1.6299,2.4446,1.4875,0.05,4.7573,3.5833,1.3282,1.7508,0.1892,5.285,0.2795,0.0121,0.3517,3.0839,1.4006,3.2773,2.8182,0.5038,2.502,3.1983,0.393,0.7661,0.056,0.0049,1.5975,0.3274,2.4196,1.1276,0.6239,0.005,3.7849,1.6874,2.2814,4.106,3.6449,5.2397,5.1083,0.4883,0.5707,0.0002,2.8999,1.8691,5.9446,2.6486,2.6424,1.9908,1.8592,4.9559,0.7432,3.2668,0.9413,0.037,1.8094,2.0243,1.5608,4.5135,1.2058,5.1896,2.615,1.6256,1.9503,0.2572,3.2523,0.7439,4.2159,0.1433,0.588,4.647,2.7146,5.3906,0.0079,0.0013,0.5066,5.6329,0.8416,0.8148,4.1944,1.0402,0.9314,0.0259,1.6159,1.7415,6.8718,1.8028,0.3535,0.0019,1.4602,2.8491,1.3732,5.1107,2.7297,1.7877,1.7457,3.7793,6.2194,0.0184,0.0283,0.2951,0.3121,1.8616,1.5983,3.804,2.9759,1.001,1.4475,1.5189,0.4968,4.3518,1.1685,1.2867,2.0021,0.7167,0.6563,1.0039,5.071,3.8439,2.6255,1.4748,5.2642,5.9568,0.1212,0.3751]}
{"id":510,"ended":true,"length":554,"gen_text":"The door will close. It's the only way in... and the only way out. \"\n\nIt was in the year 2000 that the first real change of fortune rolled in because of the emergence of the internet. It was this sudden and unexpected 'game-changer' - a phenomenon that could change everything from the way we live to the way we communicate.\n\nThe game is called the internet.\n\nThe first computer\n\nWhen most people think of computers, they probably think of the IBM personal computers or the Apple Macintosh. This picture of the computer was created by IBM and created to promote home computers. As for Apple, we've seen our share of products from here, too, including:\n\nThe Mac.\n\nThe Lisa.\n\nThe iMac.\n\nThe PowerBook.\n\nThe iMac Pro.\n\nThese devices helped revolutionise computing and brought about change, and there's no doubt that we now use computers to do everything from writing emails to managing social networks.\n\nHowever, the introduction of these powerful devices and the subsequent development of the internet enabled new forms of creativity and communication.\n\nWe now use smartphones to organise our lives. On them, we share information - often in a stream, which is so important in the age of social media.\n\nThe internet changed our way of speaking, too, and opened up huge access to knowledge and ideas. Suddenly, we got to see the world in new ways as information is streamed through email, blogs and other means.\n\nNow, it's our responsibility to use the internet to help make the world a better place. The internet is here to stay. So, as we enter the 21st century, the responsibility is on us all to use it better than before.\n\nTechnology is not the enemy\n\nOver the last twenty-five years, the internet has changed the world. It has allowed us to share our thoughts and thoughts have empowered many with new ideas, perspectives, and ideas.\n\nTechnology is an amazing thing. If used responsibly, it not only facilitates communication and knowledge-sharing, but can offer many new avenues for innovation. This isn't to say that there are not challenges, but it's important that we put these forward for discussion. Instead of letting the internet run amok and disrupting our society, we should be looking to it as an important and exciting tool for society to take up.\n\nThe problem is that too, it is not without some risks.\n\nThe internet does not always work the way we expect... if it's not managed right. It can be used as a means of exploitation for companies to make money. The very nature of technology means that it could become a means for terrorists to communicate and recruit.\n\nSo it is up to us not to let the use of the internet interfere with our everyday lives.\n\nIt's about time we gave back to society what they are so good at providing \u2013 knowledge, opportunity and hope for change.","token_len":611,"entropy":[7.8853,5.2706,3.1858,2.4639,3.5094,1.325,3.0796,2.4317,0.5804,4.1886,5.9383,3.8487,1.7482,0.2135,0.047,0.0384,0.9979,4.5877,1.5523,0.0179,5.0514,1.8793,4.7395,1.2175,5.904,3.7104,0.6029,1.3413,2.6587,5.4996,5.4464,3.6681,4.6343,7.2585,0.871,8.5289,0.7813,0.776,4.8033,0.031,1.1556,1.9377,0.4919,3.0285,0.6003,3.823,5.2838,2.0151,2.4112,5.4344,4.0515,1.2331,0.3345,0.0002,0.1907,5.968,2.1201,4.0478,0.72,3.8151,2.0391,2.3163,3.513,0.9566,0.7938,0.7428,2.5302,0.7496,0.4211,0.1322,0.1648,3.8826,0.9202,1.0246,0.0003,1.8379,5.1865,3.5588,1.8764,2.1658,1.2152,0.8987,1.0218,0.0001,1.7437,3.4644,4.6906,4.6087,0.0002,3.9203,4.839,0.3286,0.2215,0.3573,1.1181,0.5542,0.1865,2.8766,0.6389,0.1092,0.9869,2.4075,3.2208,2.6303,2.8045,0.4815,0.9183,0.7892,0.4442,3.8805,5.7469,1.6962,0.8242,2.2397,3.2468,2.041,1.0741,2.1549,2.3819,4.995,1.755,2.6171,6.7629,1.0672,0.9135,4.7856,4.2244,1.3392,0.2294,3.9624,3.417,2.7338,6.4725,2.3728,0.0537,4.7591,2.6468,5.074,1.9689,2.2289,1.9737,2.8862,4.808,0.7653,0.0002,1.0339,2.7923,2.9522,0.6395,0.0002,0.2876,3.345,0.3065,0.0208,0.0002,0.17,1.2142,0.032,0.1099,0.0185,0.0002,0.3499,1.4434,0.7656,0.7535,0.0163,0.0002,0.3505,1.2149,1.0217,1.285,0.0823,0.023,0.0002,4.4458,3.6995,4.8956,3.8618,0.9785,2.3903,1.6219,3.6259,2.1865,6.1119,2.8951,3.264,4.7478,1.6069,0.5576,0.36,0.3061,4.0087,4.9412,2.9926,0.7679,2.1434,1.4189,1.932,0.2925,4.2303,1.7974,0.3932,3.6357,3.4082,1.4152,0.507,0.4965,0.0002,2.5552,0.0266,1.7133,4.6859,0.0184,3.6292,4.7687,1.699,3.7554,0.5699,3.7592,3.0648,0.0914,0.427,0.2206,5.7055,3.3122,3.5209,0.0308,3.7267,1.0546,1.9609,1.1472,1.0945,0.0002,4.0283,2.154,1.3433,4.9832,1.1752,4.9651,0.473,0.5504,1.9379,6.1126,2.5004,0.5742,0.1571,2.2335,2.8182,3.9912,5.4061,2.7048,1.5855,5.3418,3.4421,2.9007,1.4358,5.0424,4.073,1.8866,1.4209,1.7291,0.0328,1.1875,0.2094,0.2796,1.3157,0.0002,2.4838,0.8686,3.4657,2.4101,2.3814,0.0103,4.7233,1.4553,0.67,2.026,1.6094,5.0594,0.3659,6.365,6.2008,0.2342,2.5553,1.1834,2.2248,0.4577,5.4546,0.2633,1.2014,5.993,1.5256,1.379,1.585,0.4589,1.4124,2.3902,0.1637,5.2329,4.4577,4.2434,4.3146,2.8094,5.8813,0.5195,2.6529,0.8671,2.9904,3.79,0.3532,0.3023,0.0002,4.3764,0.8257,2.9996,0.3495,3.7302,5.4971,0.2,2.0875,1.2044,0.317,1.0802,2.749,3.5269,1.1489,0.1788,0.216,0.0818,0.0434,0.4366,3.4425,0.9316,0.8902,2.7872,0.1577,0.1151,1.3449,3.3656,1.0879,3.8939,1.6639,4.7372,0.6569,1.0754,0.0087,0.1852,0.1434,2.9505,3.0018,0.7748,1.0302,0.2016,3.645,0.233,1.2528,0.1953,4.8941,2.1797,2.2059,0.2033,0.2292,0.0002,4.7152,1.6374,2.6459,2.0128,1.0912,0.3682,0.0002,5.7177,0.1369,1.2894,4.6382,2.4874,0.1849,0.0135,0.1408,1.3619,0.8344,0.0754,2.1651,0.9524,1.3705,1.0563,1.4162,0.7278,2.9449,0.7968,0.0721,2.7162,2.2169,1.5224,1.0657,4.1204,1.2973,5.558,4.6114,5.1386,1.7951,1.9529,1.9546,5.3404,1.8289,0.7739,2.919,0.5042,0.5342,0.0002,2.663,0.8368,4.2847,1.6075,1.3696,0.8092,4.9153,3.0855,3.1665,0.2248,0.2408,7.5629,0.0041,4.9311,1.1531,1.6625,2.2155,3.0968,0.0441,0.4523,0.5037,2.465,5.8823,3.4541,2.8617,3.5679,0.685,3.6261,0.8993,4.4881,5.1533,0.0004,1.1511,0.1203,0.1718,3.9237,1.8011,1.6372,2.9975,2.4031,1.6423,2.3669,0.9791,0.9787,2.5994,0.1471,5.3708,2.9121,6.7186,3.6603,0.882,1.1258,6.9777,0.1551,5.5259,1.7466,1.1478,2.7273,1.3778,0.0269,2.6993,4.7696,0.7451,2.848,0.2348,0.4575,1.1327,1.4687,2.5669,0.9678,2.6122,1.1836,1.26,3.8164,3.5914,3.5877,1.2012,1.6187,4.2341,1.3238,4.4629,4.0334,0.5448,0.1095,0.0002,1.8902,4.2539,0.8598,0.6609,3.1533,8.9498,3.3321,1.8303,1.6334,1.9921,4.6116,3.0222,0.3593,2.0302,0.0002,1.7737,0.5374,4.8571,1.686,2.6366,1.295,2.3265,0.0614,0.5146,1.2012,7.5382,6.2918,1.0827,1.8329,0.5103,4.2322,3.1715,0.4709,2.5988,1.2738,1.1108,1.6745,2.9339,0.1689,2.8788,0.9673,3.6629,3.3541,3.2941,2.418,1.6053,0.5472,1.3902,3.1062,5.978,1.1907,0.0093,3.6112,0.8793,0.1965,1.0621,4.573,3.7646,1.0114,3.0101,1.5271,4.1392,0.295,1.5419,1.3202,2.7715,1.0528,0.6901,0.0002,3.4429,3.2115,1.2883,2.918,0.0061,0.1932,5.2865,0.2142,0.9864,1.1395,6.4304,0.024,0.5675,0.0227,5.636,0.0728,0.5076,3.5101,0.1017,0.5875,1.4539,0.0002,2.9487,0.7087,3.1281,3.509,0.4631,5.3959,3.8061,0.8389,3.448,2.1517,3.1707,4.2592,2.7164,2.1435,0.0209,2.2694,5.1004,2.6057,1.1036,5.1654,0.7725,5.4697,2.868,3.4682,0.1543]}
{"id":1953,"ended":true,"length":567,"gen_text":"A person has entered a videogame. Tell me what happens next?\n\nIt doesn't exactly make sense that the first thing that happens to a videogame is when you make it, but let me explain:\n\nA videogame's story is not its mechanics, and a videogame's mechanics are not its story. This is important to remind you because when the story starts, you will notice a few odd things\u2014like how you're not getting thrown around but actually travelling in your chair\u2014and you will ask yourself if you're playing a game. You will also be reminded of why you were sent to investigate this area in the first place\u2014who sent you, and why do you now have no memories?\n\nWhile trying to figure out what's going on, you won't notice all the clues around you: strange symbols on some walls, and some strange figures appearing and disappearing, and there's a video here and there telling you about something called \"graphics chips.\" You'll also see a lot of the enemies in this videogame and wonder if they're not talking about you. Who are they talking to, and why do your controls just not work properly?\n\nEventually, you will finally decide to play this videogame for yourself, but you won't get far. You do realise what you are supposed to do, though, and try to find out what happened on your tour so far. The only thing you can see that isn't a ghostly spectre is a door, but it's too late, and your journey is about to end very soon. Maybe it's just a metaphor for the afterlife, but it seems like a fair idea.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nThe real point of all this is simply that what we think is the game's mechanics might not always be what we think is the game's story\u2026\n\nWhile I was going through this game, I noticed one particular feature which isn't explained very well. This is during the first mission. I noticed this when I had to destroy a large bomb floating around in the air, the explosion blew up a large fire and a lot of enemies. The game says that this part of the game is where you can \"build\" up your character's abilities and \"level up.\" So I guess that means that if the game's story is about someone making a videogame\u2026\n\n\u2026then it's not about the videogame.\n\nConclusion\n\nI don't think people who are sceptical that games can tell a story don't understand what I'm saying. It's not about the mechanics, it's about the experience.\n\nYou are not always going to understand exactly how a videogame is doing what it's doing. Sometimes, it's just about \"feeling\" it, and that's more than enough to give the game away. If no one can tell you what a videogame is doing, then the only people who need to know will be those who play it for themselves.","token_len":611,"entropy":[6.0629,4.2199,5.0802,2.058,10.4381,0.0443,3.5397,9.4706,1.6826,1.8149,2.025,1.4261,3.883,0.7797,0.0083,3.7731,3.7958,0.0011,6.6032,3.2866,0.6039,2.9399,1.7715,2.9777,1.1029,2.0954,0.778,2.5095,1.2787,2.349,0.0112,0.6842,4.2214,1.3058,5.2731,1.1935,2.7097,1.1174,4.9661,2.1406,0.9963,2.5843,1.6264,0.0002,2.5884,1.3715,0.0059,3.6245,3.9737,0.8533,3.0363,2.8136,3.6401,1.8911,1.9908,2.225,0.336,0.0041,0.1596,0.3922,0.3763,0.061,0.2822,0.0438,0.072,4.5933,0.5355,3.651,0.9768,7.0428,0.6447,1.9023,3.8437,4.1517,2.5371,3.2018,1.1577,1.61,3.5352,4.1834,3.0283,2.2592,5.4347,0.784,6.292,2.041,2.2835,2.7748,2.7629,1.8738,4.6291,5.8428,1.2683,5.9005,4.6342,5.6311,2.0576,3.8994,4.1718,2.9073,0.9943,1.4931,1.2375,3.9345,0.4348,3.4253,1.5653,0.9968,2.2697,0.7304,0.9308,1.3776,3.0518,1.3218,1.9517,3.4725,3.4268,1.6994,3.3609,0.78,4.0117,5.3408,0.7079,6.6075,1.6823,3.7961,0.9978,0.0469,0.0067,0.0023,2.6584,5.8303,0.781,0.0355,0.8938,1.1843,0.4762,5.4099,1.1512,5.1882,1.0182,4.5378,4.2311,2.0177,1.0419,0.0002,5.5648,6.1904,0.0322,1.6706,0.2657,0.9018,1.5464,0.2256,0.0131,0.3543,0.2986,5.8272,0.0008,2.0549,4.3372,0.4703,5.0062,4.0211,0.1737,2.9096,5.71,2.2954,1.7411,5.3512,0.8883,0.2686,3.2608,3.6889,2.4593,4.8782,4.1889,1.4771,0.1092,3.3891,1.2573,5.1179,1.1041,0.9241,5.5528,6.3787,2.0209,0.5647,5.0851,0.1012,1.9773,2.6047,2.1207,1.3157,6.2799,3.9943,4.4886,1.4646,1.9905,1.373,0.9811,3.1349,1.4665,2.3137,0.0248,3.7536,5.1372,2.6326,2.5162,2.0821,0.0011,4.2205,2.759,1.651,1.0257,0.6341,3.4543,5.0734,0.8948,0.3731,0.6975,6.0113,0.7107,0.7695,1.8092,1.8339,1.801,0.1888,0.4981,1.6794,7.1267,5.7484,5.0332,2.8874,0.1288,4.1423,0.2047,0.6188,0.0002,2.802,0.4737,0.516,0.9301,4.7407,5.2087,0.9226,3.2888,2.2905,0.4269,0.0004,4.3447,0.4401,1.1048,2.5268,1.2895,1.5593,0.0002,3.4547,2.0032,1.5872,1.4062,6.5263,4.788,4.1081,1.3414,2.0083,3.3959,0.0022,0.2958,1.0668,2.0937,0.774,0.8562,5.2378,0.4603,2.882,1.0979,0.9214,1.8847,4.9016,2.1254,6.7879,4.1867,0.0427,0.4407,3.2858,3.3774,1.1362,0.7324,1.9756,3.5737,3.2185,2.6192,0.0002,1.6498,4.8177,2.3063,4.7478,0.0933,0.4112,0.9342,3.8631,1.6513,2.1127,2.0452,1.0145,2.8623,1.8404,2.4995,1.2418,3.566,3.6729,0.8333,4.34,0.015,0.5399,5.9366,1.1025,0.1718,6.8196,2.7247,0.7285,2.9487,1.2572,4.8469,1.3906,1.4838,5.9491,0.4821,0.7063,2.1637,2.541,1.1173,1.599,4.5314,3.8256,0.6434,0.2318,0.0001,3.9339,1.8267,0.6512,0.6857,0.038,0.0949,0.5001,0.574,0.0002,2.3556,5.279,4.174,0.3643,2.2684,0.2318,0.3987,6.1447,1.1018,5.4827,2.7892,2.609,2.024,1.9831,3.2376,1.2766,5.5001,3.8647,0.825,3.9756,0.1508,0.9963,2.2182,0.8235,0.6593,0.1716,0.4562,0.0466,0.0365,6.3004,1.4307,0.0002,5.614,2.6945,2.0231,4.2821,0.7099,1.2142,2.8429,0.5731,0.2342,2.0156,4.3624,2.6756,3.8865,3.2945,5.4325,0.0002,3.0391,2.4948,0.4896,1.683,3.5193,1.2261,5.9168,0.5609,2.4404,2.8049,2.1762,3.7465,3.1917,2.9717,2.5698,0.7311,3.7717,1.3619,4.7322,0.8875,3.8102,5.2708,5.9544,1.7447,1.2726,0.3483,1.2832,1.2311,5.505,3.1474,5.4498,1.3596,1.1839,2.3651,6.3925,2.6593,2.2119,3.0343,0.0066,3.7787,2.2096,2.4015,2.7051,3.6838,0.747,2.1834,4.9191,0.6615,0.0177,0.5348,0.6966,3.1513,0.5579,3.8948,2.7816,5.0705,1.3568,4.3663,0.6606,1.3271,1.9453,2.484,2.1199,3.0073,1.9997,0.127,1.3408,3.9702,1.375,4.5012,1.7761,1.2691,0.6554,3.5102,2.8726,1.6652,2.1434,0.9237,1.0923,1.479,5.1625,4.3306,0.5826,0.7519,0.0023,5.0654,1.3868,0.0001,0.689,1.0836,2.2716,1.1403,2.5897,2.1949,1.058,1.3579,0.0566,1.8222,0.6646,0.0001,5.4915,0.1047,0.0002,2.0214,2.8501,0.0004,1.302,5.4295,2.7826,2.4118,5.3076,0.0336,5.1457,1.8996,1.6471,1.8319,1.5325,0.2325,5.069,0.0003,1.0115,1.7074,1.4645,0.3611,1.0234,0.5415,2.8268,0.3525,1.1468,1.6341,1.0131,3.2699,1.1358,0.7274,0.0206,0.2303,0.2292,4.3368,0.7354,2.0142,0.0002,3.8024,3.5002,1.8052,5.5627,1.4326,0.007,2.3119,4.972,2.1105,0.8618,0.5097,0.0012,2.061,4.6151,0.8589,0.0471,0.5056,0.0307,1.0081,2.4687,1.3222,1.36,1.0058,1.8389,2.4709,4.4606,2.7479,0.0279,0.324,2.3021,1.193,0.7744,2.0976,0.6808,5.0239,1.0234,0.1993,1.4135,3.344,2.7044,1.0408,2.6658,0.1552,3.3335,7.1952,0.5052,2.163,1.8502,0.7165,0.6963,2.4246,0.3256,0.001,0.2549,0.9851,0.3754,0.7649,2.9587,2.4542,3.4214,0.2547,4.6839,0.0655,0.6568,2.8238,0.0521,1.482,0.2918,2.4032,0.5906,3.3013,0.3879,0.4833]}
{"id":1513,"ended":false,"length":555,"gen_text":"You are a were-tree.\n\nYour were-tree is growing new sap and you are the one who nourishes it.\n\nYour were-tree is growing new leaves and you are the one who nourishes it. Your were-tree is sending buds and cones up to the sky right now and you are the one who nourishes it.\n\nYour were-tree is sending leaves and flowers down from the sky right now and you are the one who nourishes it. This new form has no purpose yet. You are still just a tree.\n\nIn this way, as the tree's growth goes into full swing, it may use your were-tree as long as you are available to care for the were-tree. You won't use it without your help.\n\nThis is great! You and the were-tree will be part of each other's lives until you become separated, but at least now you have each other.\n\nWhile you may still be growing in this way, you must get your life moving towards something new. You must develop a purpose.\n\nYour life is just full of directionless wandering, where you might even feel that all your thoughts, actions, and thoughts are just random motions.\n\nYou do not really understand why we are alive, why this amazing world exists.\n\nEven life's biggest mysteries have remained a mystery to most people. The origin of the Earth, gravity, the meaning of life, the true nature of God, and many more are all questions that we don't really have an answer for.\n\nWe don't understand our place in the universe. I certainly do not know my place in the universe yet.\n\nBut I do know that what we think is the truth may not be the truth. We can make all sorts of guesses, but there will never be a direct answer.\n\nMost people's lives are like this. Sometimes it may seem that life is full of directionless wandering, but when you get some way of identifying the direction to go in, something will begin happening.\n\nYou have a lot of things to discover. Let's start moving!\n\nSo, my friend, we just have to continue growing our lives. If you aren't sure if that's a good idea now, it's likely a bad idea. Once you have more direction, you may not be surprised by the direction, but you will be surprised to learn that people who are guided are more content and fulfilled then people who aren't. So that's good, and we should try to understand how our lives might need to change to make it a better place for others.\n\nSo, my friend, there's much you need to know about living your life in harmony with the universe. If you are starting a new project and need to understand that, then start here.\n\nIf you are wondering if the universe wants you to live a very life, I think that's a good place to start.\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":611,"entropy":[3.0403,2.7191,9.6815,4.0434,8.7237,1.8697,2.2503,0.011,3.5476,3.7909,0.0615,0.675,1.2607,5.6159,5.5113,6.27,2.7348,2.8022,1.0621,3.505,3.0659,0.6894,3.657,0.0101,0.2011,0.3425,0.4154,0.0001,1.915,0.3936,0.0037,0.0445,0.6897,2.2923,0.8322,1.7096,0.3063,0.0876,0.0809,0.0356,0.0211,0.0425,0.9688,0.0046,3.0322,0.0229,6.1759,0.086,0.0026,0.0061,0.1008,6.9648,6.5791,0.9487,5.7704,4.1399,1.2703,0.3161,0.7265,7.9838,0.0258,1.1931,0.1979,0.0459,0.0412,0.04,0.0458,0.1977,0.0026,1.523,0.0403,0.3505,0.0001,0.5925,0.0753,0.0027,0.0051,0.166,1.073,2.1643,0.7696,2.4375,1.2256,2.7008,0.245,0.8256,0.4823,0.0017,0.124,0.0189,0.01,0.0045,0.0151,0.0035,0.0099,0.0008,0.0891,0.0176,5.8181,5.1952,4.498,3.2824,3.0696,5.4399,3.9656,0.9429,2.0232,0.8353,2.8883,2.6507,0.3981,1.2543,0.641,0.9465,0.0002,4.4513,2.0738,2.1843,0.5359,4.191,2.1254,3.0845,3.7325,3.6288,4.5016,4.2443,2.9496,1.3714,0.1864,1.8399,4.8722,5.7668,3.2584,2.4271,0.0185,0.228,0.8395,7.4201,0.0356,0.8156,1.1249,4.7363,0.8093,5.9113,0.0484,3.3627,3.5156,0.0075,0.021,0.4845,2.3625,6.6046,0.0008,5.203,1.1347,5.294,1.1616,3.4912,0.5271,0.6123,0.0002,3.1409,1.1215,6.6439,2.0749,1.2798,5.0165,1.767,0.6251,0.0068,0.006,2.4782,1.5388,5.1911,0.0032,2.21,0.0217,0.6538,0.5563,4.6149,1.6284,4.0634,3.844,2.8041,2.5958,3.408,0.446,2.3429,0.387,1.4143,3.7707,0.0308,0.6618,0.531,0.0002,5.7221,1.1425,3.1287,3.2158,1.1659,3.4203,2.991,1.4614,0.6102,0.2767,1.1292,3.8045,5.5876,2.9484,3.1234,4.503,4.5881,3.0395,2.3286,0.3891,1.8509,0.9727,4.2553,1.5409,1.8518,1.3501,0.9753,0.0002,3.0657,2.2575,1.2448,4.3611,6.1067,0.0124,5.0862,0.6533,1.7535,1.8217,5.6426,0.9184,4.9121,4.4682,3.0471,2.3422,4.9669,2.009,3.5571,2.9698,2.3107,0.2528,0.2639,2.894,0.8645,2.3186,1.6606,5.4736,0.8917,0.7915,0.0002,1.9264,5.1669,0.647,3.4013,3.3928,2.0699,6.0655,1.0401,5.3824,1.2644,1.4667,3.1559,6.6437,1.8733,0.9319,2.155,1.8199,0.0002,4.6608,6.6696,1.8742,3.4631,0.6012,3.0109,4.4703,1.8394,0.0263,0.643,4.299,1.4352,0.4387,3.2771,4.3376,0.0731,0.648,4.7327,0.5473,5.2431,0.0518,1.0498,3.6749,0.0358,0.3071,0.2389,1.2707,3.8725,0.5244,0.0167,3.5368,0.383,1.2876,2.7882,1.6747,1.6994,1.4914,2.9277,0.4535,2.9654,3.4659,0.0009,1.0936,1.3668,1.1925,0.064,0.6734,0.2197,0.2257,0.0002,2.7252,2.3039,0.0004,2.2817,3.6026,2.018,0.0872,0.3197,0.4007,1.0436,5.59,5.6981,2.4999,0.0147,2.7283,4.6766,0.4917,0.1229,0.3617,0.1209,4.6914,0.4043,0.7076,0.0002,2.1607,1.2089,1.1873,0.129,0.6619,5.1949,2.1268,3.317,2.0549,2.6745,2.4995,4.5587,0.5876,0.2169,0.5045,0.3799,0.6365,2.4825,2.4497,4.2349,3.5443,1.4397,0.0022,1.9618,1.359,0.4503,2.7274,3.6915,1.8461,0.0405,0.8087,4.314,0.4108,0.8852,0.4094,0.0002,5.3685,0.9459,3.9778,0.7963,0.5827,2.7329,0.5326,0.3894,5.798,3.4791,4.5554,0.8459,1.1845,2.4278,0.3528,4.5393,0.0058,1.3546,0.5833,0.192,0.427,0.5675,4.0535,0.5546,3.1913,4.2207,6.9297,1.3964,4.6393,2.2297,0.5923,4.9487,1.9412,0.5208,0.2071,5.1472,2.0266,2.364,4.4976,0.266,0.255,0.0002,1.929,4.0078,2.4067,4.468,0.3593,3.0043,0.9403,3.6976,1.378,5.7053,0.5231,1.5583,5.0557,2.669,0.2751,0.0002,4.8224,1.5211,5.6565,0.915,0.085,4.2097,4.9786,1.9064,0.0733,5.5143,2.3496,2.65,2.4467,1.241,4.0563,1.0517,4.932,0.0004,2.4702,3.4706,3.8447,1.0416,2.1277,0.2268,0.3665,5.9756,0.0507,2.1288,1.6956,4.7246,2.6936,1.8263,0.0145,1.8417,5.5305,0.2956,2.0487,5.0621,0.8451,0.5883,0.6339,2.5372,2.8688,1.8482,5.2163,2.2679,1.489,0.7512,4.7385,1.3106,0.8811,0.7537,0.8395,0.4181,3.5122,3.0048,0.9472,6.5453,2.3224,1.8518,4.0135,2.5672,2.2769,4.2788,1.526,2.8879,6.113,1.1105,0.0509,1.4064,0.0003,0.1549,4.7171,4.0929,0.2982,2.176,2.3947,4.0754,2.3571,1.4583,2.2969,0.2755,5.5407,3.0969,3.4933,0.4431,2.8337,5.2844,1.1014,1.0729,1.5781,2.047,2.3109,2.6882,0.9868,0.3581,1.6589,3.3146,0.7234,0.1757,0.0002,2.5623,0.7479,2.1515,0.0854,0.0268,4.5823,1.7531,4.5038,2.347,2.449,0.0049,2.3208,0.6577,3.0457,2.2869,0.1535,2.074,4.1463,0.2664,0.7563,1.1484,0.4054,3.6069,0.2002,1.9813,4.9003,3.4945,0.4565,2.546,3.2393,2.6207,1.767,4.2068,4.7933,2.0602,2.0963,3.2495,1.8511,0.4018,0.9377,0.0002,1.044,0.0678,0.9564,4.0009,1.706,3.6334,1.3168,2.3976,0.3763,0.0506,2.5369,1.8617,6.3668,5.336,1.9796,3.7077,2.3947,2.0047,0.962,0.8422,0.9085,1.8629,0.0189,0.0664,0.2586,0.885,0.0002,5.3083]}
{"id":879,"ended":true,"length":586,"gen_text":"Ten sentences : Five to break my heart, and five to reassemble it.\n\n:, and. Seven sentences: Five to break my heart, and five to reassemble it.\n\nAs you should know if you've actually sat through the episode, it's hard to convey the sheer insanity of those sentences. The worst was right at the end after Rose and Dave realize that the man they've been searching for is now in their living room. This is it. The final moment of the show, the one we spent months preparing so that it would arrive in time for Halloween. It's so bad that for a minute we've completely lost track of the characters, what they want, or what they're trying to do.\n\nHere's the big takeaway from our recap: There won't be an explanation of why this happened, but we're taking it and moving on.\n\nWe are, however, taking a moment to share five amazing lines from the episode.\n\n\"You've got time for a little self-examination? That's really something, coming from you\" \u2014 Jack\n\nWe knew what was going down in that moment (we were watching it!) but even the way Chris' face changes when he says, \"I'm not here,\" only to get punched in the stomach, or when Jack asks \"You've got time for a little self-examination?\" is amazing.\n\n\"What we're here for is that the game is over.\" \u2014 Jack\n\nThe way the camera pulls back from Rose and Dave's faces shows that the episode doesn't end with them punching each other. The rest of the characters continue to talk, as they did throughout the episode, at dinner, when they found the real person (\"I didn't think I'd find my friend,\" Jack said before stabbing Dave's neck), and just about anything else.\n\n\"So let us take the rest out of this world\" \u2014 Dave\n\nThe most important aspect of this episode was that for the first time, we saw something that had taken place not just on the streets of Boston, but the internet at large. The internet is a very different place from the streets of Boston, but people still interact with each other on it. When you spend your day interacting with strangers online, even if they don't know you, the world we live in is a very different place.\n\nEven in this world, though, there is always enough of an audience to help amplify a story, not just in the way that online communities usually rely. We can only hope that this particular story gets a bigger platform, either through broadcast or on television. We saw the story unfold this week, all of these characters together, and it wasn't the big deal that it could turn out to be. It was the little things, the little acts of kindness, that felt incredibly meaningful, that we can still remember long after we've left our homes.\n\nRead more Boston Marathon manhunt coverage on The Huffington Post.","token_len":611,"entropy":[10.8969,8.1056,6.6306,3.5728,9.1797,6.4675,1.468,2.2232,2.5246,1.6956,0.2642,6.3807,4.8494,0.0335,1.3127,0.6167,0.695,0.0263,9.7714,0.6755,5.0292,4.9847,0.752,2.6736,2.2512,0.2291,0.3708,0.0081,0.004,0.0713,0.0329,0.0649,0.0046,0.0207,0.0006,0.0,0.0008,0.0368,2.3533,0.0001,6.3467,1.9567,6.364,1.8528,3.8122,0.0266,0.9553,6.144,5.3174,0.3113,1.6767,4.7908,0.3274,3.4068,0.7266,4.5209,0.1689,4.5277,0.9293,2.1125,5.0776,0.3409,5.5606,2.4121,0.6433,2.7561,5.5664,5.0959,5.6369,0.5895,0.0103,0.865,6.5833,6.0607,2.2133,4.5368,5.3056,0.8903,2.0168,5.2203,0.9625,1.7138,0.4026,2.7849,0.0195,0.9896,3.913,1.8384,0.8664,3.5341,0.0311,0.7451,4.0337,0.8933,6.2744,1.167,1.7328,2.9486,3.9812,0.734,0.8746,2.0113,1.8949,1.7986,2.0063,3.3014,5.1622,3.5166,3.7419,5.7021,1.2107,1.3797,0.6112,6.2256,2.1045,1.4111,0.4225,2.861,0.4895,2.2037,0.6968,3.3106,2.8257,0.8824,5.4666,0.9371,3.202,2.8843,5.7249,4.5857,1.5185,1.8299,0.0125,1.4291,2.7355,1.391,4.6831,0.9028,3.7355,0.2693,2.9794,1.1085,1.1399,0.8981,2.0524,0.008,1.0413,0.1624,1.7665,0.0003,4.976,0.3317,0.9152,5.4514,3.5498,1.338,5.1205,3.2434,0.6795,3.9803,6.5545,0.0011,0.0684,2.7434,5.3403,1.4905,2.3818,1.8967,1.5459,1.5674,2.1901,2.0433,2.122,5.8645,1.4596,6.8041,2.4736,0.0985,0.1919,1.7334,0.0002,3.0602,3.7278,3.0152,1.2013,0.0124,2.6028,1.3228,0.9488,0.0777,3.988,5.5295,6.0077,2.7373,0.3918,0.5121,0.5505,1.0189,1.7748,0.0002,1.7619,2.3956,3.328,1.6232,5.9281,1.4828,1.7226,2.5933,3.9073,0.1304,2.9764,2.2622,3.3037,0.259,4.9692,2.1758,1.9121,3.6804,0.0585,0.6952,4.9385,1.9253,5.1646,0.8402,0.0002,3.5642,3.5928,4.4949,1.1277,1.8943,4.8608,2.5996,2.3787,1.556,5.2535,3.2446,2.8984,3.5266,1.6165,4.7523,0.4698,4.1472,2.3029,4.8883,6.901,5.1682,1.9269,4.8928,1.3032,0.6851,3.021,3.6944,0.0175,1.7454,1.5471,2.027,4.1446,4.2455,5.2418,3.0647,3.0966,3.58,0.4253,0.0197,3.3282,2.003,2.7945,1.8019,1.888,3.8499,3.4175,2.7533,2.4806,0.3264,0.198,0.0199,0.0276,0.0036,0.0143,0.0469,0.0096,0.7292,0.9447,2.8309,0.2021,1.1771,0.0002,0.3335,3.547,4.0985,1.7114,4.3295,0.5475,0.5616,4.9422,3.9744,5.5613,1.1053,1.0841,2.0496,0.0574,1.6859,0.0915,0.0002,2.7411,3.6027,2.8528,2.4312,2.5685,0.2862,1.8131,1.4196,1.3859,0.1464,1.238,2.3229,5.785,2.2378,2.6307,3.7305,4.3125,0.0003,2.3804,0.9312,1.5559,4.6477,0.3269,0.004,1.0968,2.7021,4.6907,0.033,0.1607,3.662,5.0478,0.438,3.4159,1.4785,4.348,2.7379,2.706,2.4961,0.1177,0.988,0.7951,6.3353,6.4855,1.0276,3.9376,0.8905,4.6122,0.976,5.5532,5.1705,7.0448,2.264,3.9115,0.0003,1.763,2.3182,1.0134,1.3756,4.991,3.5817,2.3175,2.1282,2.7707,5.3666,5.3193,1.623,4.2433,3.4718,0.733,0.5989,4.5979,2.1569,2.6951,0.2519,1.5545,1.0671,0.0002,0.3224,4.396,4.3171,4.3019,4.1184,2.3819,4.5296,6.0579,0.6003,2.2408,2.6126,1.6563,0.0167,2.1288,0.0966,0.0002,2.3215,3.7388,2.51,5.497,0.0557,1.3222,1.9594,1.8877,1.6185,5.4342,0.6086,0.2672,0.0246,1.2044,0.9357,1.4566,4.6247,1.9262,3.8494,5.8042,0.3423,4.2608,1.5452,1.7911,0.5595,3.8644,0.3129,4.0068,0.7405,0.0388,3.4092,5.4297,3.5005,0.0258,0.2354,2.1727,2.783,1.5944,1.4047,3.5238,2.751,0.2403,1.5683,0.7035,0.7343,0.6127,0.0546,0.7439,1.6935,6.1196,1.818,4.1876,0.8337,0.6172,0.0044,1.8098,1.3563,0.7369,3.8191,2.562,5.3204,2.6084,2.3585,3.9045,0.1215,1.1861,2.1097,0.1754,4.4044,0.5402,1.6971,2.6352,0.0003,1.1064,0.2793,0.2855,3.4313,3.7608,5.696,0.4613,0.0118,0.9473,2.2331,0.8766,0.0497,0.3341,1.2747,1.0886,0.0002,4.442,2.9919,2.0419,2.7189,0.2844,2.5974,0.0252,1.7938,1.9013,3.4162,6.8295,2.7612,2.3774,2.6713,1.058,4.6379,5.7484,1.9673,1.7685,2.3538,6.1561,0.7354,2.2826,1.2913,2.4428,0.7775,5.8421,3.0268,5.9792,7.4932,4.2349,3.0664,2.6926,2.6302,0.4312,0.1581,1.7118,4.3207,0.6127,2.5276,2.6916,3.5667,2.754,1.8894,4.9516,1.5211,5.4059,0.325,2.6226,3.0207,0.8527,3.0285,5.2142,2.2518,3.6476,2.6162,4.7726,0.7971,0.7753,5.9326,2.4107,3.0576,0.71,4.8956,0.8942,1.2116,1.6073,4.5753,0.0002,3.49,6.0254,4.9511,1.2599,0.8855,1.4647,8.4942,0.084,0.0075,0.0137,0.3645,1.4801,0.6931,2.4933,2.1899,1.1716,1.3118,1.0831,1.6895,5.2602,0.2035,0.2485,0.833,0.9617,5.7825,5.3953,3.6623,2.4401,3.6645,2.5503,2.4595,4.1226,1.3526,4.645,0.0304,1.3639,0.4802,2.4116,3.6015,2.3826,0.4433,0.5478,0.0002,5.1374,0.8734,3.8341,1.7329,5.6211,0.0226,0.1834,0.8365,1.7753,1.8245,0.0013,0.8813]}
{"id":4354,"ended":false,"length":569,"gen_text":"You are the loneliest whale in the world. Your voice is in the range of 52Hz, much higher than any other whales speak or can understand. You have roamed the oceans for decades completely alone. One day something returns your call. It is not a whale, but it is sending an urgent message. You understand its language, its need. The message is that you need help!\n\nThe message comes with a mysterious package. It sounds like a message you cannot decode, but the time it landed could be described as a miracle. You open the package and it contains a picture of a small and frail looking man.\n\nHe is a scientist and he has come to you because he knew that you were alone in the universe. The scientist has a strange device with two blinking lights that can change the speed of light. He would like to use it on you to communicate with you.\n\nYour heart melts and you want to accept his challenge. You open the box and it holds another object that is a living creature with many amazing creatures around them. These creatures are called your parents and your family is ready to welcome them with passion and joy. The scientist uses the speed-speed device on you so you can hear the message.\n\nThey tell you that you need to visit them and meet them on the moon. As a reward they open the box and it contains 2 gifts that are you very own 2 personal spaceships.\n\nThe First Spaceship contains: 5 pairs of your favourite coloured shoes and a bag full of love, happiness, and happiness\n\nThe Second Spaceship contains: 8 pairs of your favourite coloured shoes and 3 months vacation in Hawaii.\n\nAnd that's as far as the game goes! It will contain a lot more for you to discover and enjoy! And when you start the game you will find all the rules in the booklet. If you die, you are completely in the hands of fate. You will never have the chance to have the two ships again. I am a bit scared! But my goal is to make a beautiful game that you will love playing for years and years!

{"id":2129,"ended":false,"length":597,"gen_text":"Thinking you're just playing along, you take a toy phone offered by a two year-old. To your surprise, a voice from the phone says `` Thank goodness! Listen, here's what you have to do... '' You 'll see that in the coming days \/ weeks... You will see how it all comes together. In short, you did everything right. You will discover that you have in fact done it all right. And the other people will're convinced that you understand. [You should read and learn : The Secret to Self-Compassion and Its Positive Impact on All Your Relationships: 5-Step Step-by-Step Guide ] And so we come to the final part of your story. You were so amazed by what you knew but had no way to prove. You would be thrilled to find what you'll find... you had no idea what to do. One day while you were away with your family, some friends invited you to a dinner party organized by them... and you didn't mind. You said yes and, as there was so much to talk about, you didn't have to worry that the other guests might think less of you because you were in a position of power. [ This is not to say that you were not aware of what you had to do when you got back ( I'll talk more about this later ) ] And so, feeling much better than you had in months, now had the will power to handle what seemed to be an incredible prospect! Of course, you always knew that you would do the right thing. The only thing was, when that day came, how would you know that you had done it? By doing it!! By making sure that you were the very first one invited to the party! [ That's a good point! You don't need to tell them that you have been invited, you just need to'have'to be there.... I am glad that my friend is now feeling less pressured. The other guests also felt that they were being invited because everyone knew that I was going to be there. There was nobody who felt like they'm going to be left out!! ) As I said earlier, this was a big help because not only did you're given a great opportunity but you also did it the RIGHT way. And I am pleased that you were as happy as you were. But you can still improve. You could ask your spouse or your partner to be present and you could encourage them if you want.

{"id":1295,"ended":false,"length":568,"gen_text":"There are many types of Mages in the world. Fire, Ice, Wind, Water, Death, Darkness, to name a few. But in this world, every type of mage is treated as equal. Everyone can be a good guy, no matter how dark your power. And anyone could be a bad guy, no matter how beautiful their ability...\n\nHowever, that is exactly what makes those kind of people interesting.\n\nEveryone knows...\n\nMage have powerful abilities, and those are the ones that can be used to save a life or a loved one.\n\nBut there are also kinds of mages that use their power and abilities to destroy people.\n\nThese are the ones that have completely twisted people's souls and will, but no one can defeat them because the ones who can control those powers has no limit... There are those who can have a very bad effect for others, and are completely unstoppable with their power... These are the ones who have made a huge difference.\n\nEveryone knows...\n\nIf the Mage is strong, the person with the worst talent are the most dangerous.\n\nThese are the ones that are feared by the world, and there are many reasons why we have to stop them.\n\nEveryone knows...\n\nThat those who make a difference must not be controlled, or be pushed to their limits.\n\n(It's not just about the type of Mage, although it is very important, but also the power they have, the weakness they have, and also the knowledge they have. Those who have knowledge will be the ones with ability to fight against the Mage! Those who have no knowledge, those who are weak will always be beaten by someone with knowledge, no matter what reason they had to lose )...\n\nThese are the same for everyone, and if you understand this, you will survive in this world, even though you can't go against the people you love and are loyal to. I won't lie, my little girl can't go against the people she loves.... I am a bit scared! But my little girl doesn't care about what I say....\n\nBut this doesn't mean that I can't be with my little girl anymore.\n\nBecause even after all that, this is still my story, and I still love her...... So, I want to continue writing my story... because if something happens to my little girl, I have a lot of things I can do without even going back to the old worlds.\n\nThis story will be written in one chapter every 3- 4 weeks. I hope that you will look forward to it, because I'll be releasing many many stories, more than 1 chapter per book.\n\nI'll let my little girl help me to make it better this time...\n\nI hope that you are still with me, and that you will keep reading this!\n\nYou may contact me via Facebook, E-mail, my mobile phone ( +234814937863 ), my Blog or Twitter","token_len":613,"entropy":[1.2101,2.4972,4.3319,0.0328,11.783,2.0268,1.0312,0.6557,1.6015,7.5224,1.3161,2.1205,0.0584,2.3829,0.1895,2.0193,0.2891,6.6183,0.3444,4.2796,0.3726,7.9183,0.0368,0.3322,0.0126,0.1366,2.7329,3.5451,1.7754,0.7818,0.4201,6.0062,2.3913,0.3556,1.905,1.1675,4.2663,1.0428,2.7566,0.6881,4.5588,2.1235,2.2623,0.8281,6.26,6.7722,1.498,5.1923,0.0918,2.3385,3.8196,3.287,5.0138,2.4472,3.2315,6.1725,4.5548,1.3204,0.4299,1.1688,0.0572,0.8913,1.0502,0.0014,0.1176,4.2452,0.6731,5.9736,5.6986,2.2516,0.0137,4.305,0.1518,3.2566,1.1767,4.5649,0.9662,2.8746,6.1698,4.1453,0.0526,2.0231,4.3007,0.397,1.3516,0.0001,5.1812,3.3428,6.5664,1.5186,0.0002,4.0574,1.525,6.214,5.2878,1.4722,1.295,1.9863,3.6789,2.6987,2.225,1.4019,1.2767,1.93,1.7074,0.8115,1.0641,4.5573,4.0029,1.6114,2.5474,2.5667,1.627,0.0167,0.2869,0.7904,0.0001,1.2636,2.4088,0.4317,0.9627,5.6601,0.2124,1.227,0.5076,2.6873,0.4663,1.0722,5.8628,1.8281,0.6501,2.2689,2.6771,1.088,0.4532,0.0002,3.7117,1.2589,0.2633,1.9853,0.6107,3.2361,5.7548,3.652,4.3907,0.1082,4.3137,2.1427,3.7375,2.4548,5.3236,3.673,0.3261,1.1763,5.2424,0.169,3.2259,3.5408,3.8501,1.0371,1.5985,4.3061,2.5911,1.793,6.6492,3.1021,3.7583,2.6662,6.2884,0.7117,2.6211,0.6784,1.1801,5.92,2.1559,4.8991,3.5775,2.2816,5.3377,1.5175,0.5652,1.0,4.9823,3.7432,4.7661,5.5874,0.6962,1.157,0.8307,4.0954,0.4182,0.2476,0.9356,0.9004,2.2776,4.1069,2.2868,3.3833,1.0413,4.356,0.2996,0.0002,4.5444,0.7732,0.8471,0.1848,0.0001,3.2796,3.3522,2.322,2.1373,2.2166,0.7889,1.0369,2.8723,2.8095,0.6252,4.4067,4.4326,6.0045,1.0445,2.1116,0.8383,0.5534,0.2819,0.0001,4.5651,0.5943,0.1188,1.1348,1.2786,2.1617,3.6285,1.2771,1.7663,1.675,1.7355,0.7628,4.279,0.6861,2.2421,4.0932,0.6331,5.6285,2.5912,1.7831,3.0752,0.1471,0.5129,0.2229,0.0002,4.1106,0.1642,0.0571,0.0154,0.0001,4.2872,3.4172,1.1578,5.3059,1.2381,1.112,3.983,2.5276,0.7657,4.8773,2.2622,2.3083,4.2978,5.1267,1.5246,1.7175,0.1776,0.5391,0.1702,0.0001,5.849,4.8112,0.7802,2.2432,1.8455,2.1873,1.9779,5.1406,0.0558,0.807,0.7968,5.7764,1.7259,0.8767,3.1693,0.1677,1.6203,0.4038,1.0077,1.3986,3.0399,2.084,0.8018,1.7503,2.1637,6.1853,0.5554,0.2539,0.3927,0.7679,2.9063,0.8464,5.34,0.2584,0.1454,1.3267,3.3962,1.3823,1.0248,2.3852,3.3597,0.9147,2.8607,0.9916,2.4787,6.4606,1.0938,2.8924,1.4574,1.2248,0.6743,6.7688,3.2244,0.3874,0.3603,3.8668,0.4014,1.6824,3.7252,0.3461,1.6995,0.7978,1.6183,4.1517,0.653,4.7721,1.0125,3.3387,1.3098,1.125,1.8996,3.4911,0.0296,1.3531,6.672,1.3705,4.0189,1.6154,2.8302,8.151,4.4462,0.5149,0.0001,4.2526,0.2257,0.1287,6.2671,4.2626,1.7054,1.1978,1.8276,3.2798,1.0925,4.7388,1.5251,0.3576,0.8662,0.6719,6.0125,2.141,0.2568,0.1749,2.5787,3.3661,3.1303,0.7112,3.5401,0.7614,4.4869,1.6747,0.7024,3.8772,2.8902,2.1919,3.136,3.3144,2.9592,0.0459,0.6082,6.0086,4.1673,0.0016,3.9641,1.498,4.9836,5.2705,4.1229,3.9615,0.865,3.1452,0.1635,1.837,0.4854,0.3629,0.3421,6.5464,3.1439,3.397,3.1478,3.4424,3.1892,4.939,2.5017,4.0382,0.7832,0.1331,3.7208,0.0004,1.748,1.0371,2.6224,2.1913,2.4257,3.6103,1.4594,0.0002,2.9371,3.7024,4.0605,0.0004,0.5463,0.8292,1.5341,1.8577,0.2613,2.7167,3.0718,1.5796,0.4785,0.0616,3.2159,1.073,0.8096,0.0001,2.9917,3.2098,4.6974,1.6,2.5734,1.146,4.093,1.2809,1.6484,0.7863,6.6027,1.9477,0.6811,1.145,3.0996,1.9385,0.9435,5.3557,4.6418,2.2791,0.915,3.1568,0.2458,2.9956,3.1959,2.3397,0.223,2.6797,5.2594,3.3759,6.1374,0.615,0.3509,1.2172,0.1745,0.0337,0.3558,0.6572,4.5084,3.5273,2.654,0.1959,1.633,1.0236,1.7608,0.4067,5.4156,4.7818,2.7287,2.4459,0.2934,1.2368,3.1916,7.075,0.8962,0.4624,0.0002,3.5648,2.2513,1.6766,1.1322,4.2335,1.0489,4.5797,2.8641,1.9451,3.3808,2.1382,6.1163,1.3496,0.8283,2.1258,2.278,2.1266,0.6375,0.8513,4.4562,0.0586,0.0544,0.6259,1.4003,2.3436,1.0465,4.4447,1.4547,4.968,3.9113,4.306,2.2137,2.2258,6.0362,0.4882,4.3534,1.6634,1.4841,6.2902,0.799,0.6994,0.0002,2.0019,2.4758,4.5485,3.2847,0.4519,0.2027,4.4783,0.1256,2.8851,3.0481,2.6797,1.8134,5.4344,0.0687,2.0251,0.9863,0.0002,2.3317,1.6834,1.6119,0.525,4.6439,2.3008,1.3548,0.0536,1.647,0.9523,1.6856,0.4923,0.9805,3.8666,1.0286,2.0592,4.0899,0.5203,0.0002,4.9513,3.1006,2.6718,0.0457,2.1529,3.4506,1.5963,4.176,0.0954,0.4131,0.4882,3.859,5.6143,0.8308,2.3401,6.0229,1.3228,0.5946,5.0402,4.6219,4.7682,1.8459,0.9762,2.6059,3.8631,1.9012,2.1874]}

even to the end of the earth\n\nHe hath sworn by his holiness, and by all the holy angels of God, his strength unto thee, though thou be old, that for thy righteousness thy land shall be glad, that thou shalt not be ashamed of thine birth.\n\nR. shall not be moved from thy way : it shall be kept for thee, and thy people shall rejoice in thy judgments.\n\nThou shalt have great peace in that day ; when ye shall say, Lo, he our father hath returned, he hath a very few; and all our fathers are become old, they also have a very few.\n\nand he shall build the walls of Jerusalem ; for he hath committed his own people before thee; he hath given them no wine nor oil for their meat, and they are filled in the midst of famine, and there is no grain in the land for them.","token_len":613,"entropy":[11.4239,11.5417,3.2602,6.0494,1.3423,1.4452,0.9561,4.5985,5.8561,0.0644,0.1587,2.3663,5.2431,0.4902,2.0354,0.0179,4.7952,1.6069,5.0558,3.8221,0.9394,3.4715,3.6761,6.7943,1.278,0.0002,6.1743,2.0043,3.6141,0.6209,0.3781,0.278,0.004,0.0335,0.0687,1.7369,1.5558,0.5837,0.0069,1.8657,2.2424,1.182,2.4787,0.1394,0.0042,0.7623,1.508,0.0868,0.0602,2.0387,1.1857,0.4434,0.0001,4.7752,0.2367,0.3999,2.3318,0.8007,2.6766,2.0609,1.776,1.6046,0.7494,1.7228,0.0268,0.0142,0.0075,0.0029,0.0805,0.2318,0.0001,4.9552,2.2289,5.7119,1.893,0.0233,2.9852,5.1013,6.4293,1.5028,4.6993,1.734,1.4204,1.4823,5.8838,0.0681,1.146,0.7099,4.3573,0.3177,0.1305,0.0001,2.0544,4.4721,2.2027,3.0362,4.7248,5.298,1.1618,3.0997,0.3891,1.1653,0.5104,1.6883,0.9777,0.1144,0.0002,5.1213,0.282,1.2094,3.8912,2.6393,1.9486,1.0836,3.6884,0.2731,0.0765,2.1394,5.0224,4.2739,2.1375,1.5417,0.002,0.1843,1.9306,2.6723,1.1883,4.2854,3.1741,5.9683,0.0616,1.9714,6.0115,1.0003,1.7402,3.988,0.0001,4.6242,4.5949,1.7076,0.0152,2.8503,0.939,4.3636,1.5921,4.6064,2.5243,4.676,1.148,1.0434,3.0055,5.8692,1.7524,1.5059,2.3359,3.4945,1.6415,3.962,1.1317,0.9485,1.0229,0.0033,6.1463,3.6547,0.6855,0.1533,0.0002,5.7824,2.9131,0.052,5.0725,5.2439,0.9979,1.2875,0.0365,0.9326,1.2458,0.1607,0.0002,5.2167,0.6386,0.1807,2.9664,5.0052,0.4331,3.812,2.4564,0.9485,1.9516,0.1532,4.2229,1.9932,0.1475,0.0002,3.2794,3.6428,2.5354,3.1913,1.2848,3.9663,0.1327,0.2801,5.9671,2.7811,0.2702,3.8166,3.9561,0.8016,4.5068,2.5135,4.6188,1.6445,4.5261,0.8333,2.4083,1.1904,1.2751,4.188,2.7435,0.3478,1.3754,1.0299,1.8856,0.1874,1.4835,3.001,2.6422,0.5014,0.095,0.0002,2.4506,1.7292,2.896,0.8147,4.7265,1.1828,4.2742,3.1618,2.7416,0.399,0.5346,0.0064,0.0872,1.7105,0.4354,0.6025,4.6428,4.0607,0.3168,1.2412,0.7541,0.4583,0.7381,3.072,0.2171,0.7891,0.8332,0.0779,0.0002,1.9325,5.7209,5.3713,1.6316,5.6232,1.9327,0.7322,5.6756,4.5908,0.0196,3.5189,4.1269,1.6837,1.1946,0.9245,2.3494,1.572,0.2003,0.0002,1.2444,1.7862,0.022,4.969,0.6543,4.3474,0.8685,1.6503,2.7489,2.584,1.7491,3.7869,0.0312,0.0007,0.2147,0.119,0.0002,1.0082,4.5992,0.6333,1.251,3.9758,0.6384,6.7095,3.5227,4.3641,6.1019,6.0826,3.723,3.7601,0.3079,1.9424,5.6256,2.6127,1.6054,3.6135,0.0133,0.6019,3.0208,0.0002,2.2296,0.0273,4.0196,2.3909,1.1028,2.308,1.315,2.0429,3.49,0.1027,4.3757,3.7118,4.9358,0.682,2.7013,1.8558,2.5441,1.1568,3.8113,2.0809,2.6347,6.4833,7.4313,0.0273,1.0278,4.262,6.6463,3.8714,1.452,0.7443,0.1112,5.7752,0.0499,1.1618,0.9918,1.7848,0.6812,0.0721,0.0002,2.0349,0.0143,2.0147,5.5924,2.1127,1.128,2.0285,0.6686,4.5113,0.6429,1.7421,3.7202,0.1221,0.0002,0.918,2.797,0.0606,2.0142,1.5805,1.3285,5.6752,0.7259,5.2589,5.5198,0.6581,0.444,1.0596,0.4419,3.1375,5.674,0.247,0.8627,2.772,0.3033,2.1796,0.8823,0.0147,0.4079,0.0071,0.2169,0.0892,0.0002,1.1818,2.0961,0.0319,1.3881,1.4185,0.9877,3.77,1.61,0.3354,5.7246,0.1018,1.0729,0.7802,0.7132,2.4727,2.2937,5.8149,2.4623,2.2427,3.7656,0.006,2.1452,0.6288,0.1829,1.6287,0.3534,1.1702,4.2854,4.7541,2.3876,0.4028,0.9559,0.2948,0.154,0.2112,3.4103,0.0002,4.8902,3.2148,2.7437,1.4001,1.2456,0.8548,0.0123,0.7754,1.0373,1.6505,2.7255,1.4027,0.702,2.4419,1.4966,1.9026,0.4721,5.1477,4.6196,6.7554,4.5557,0.7026,7.0933,0.5004,1.2753,5.5848,1.023,2.6669,5.8115,0.7718,3.8846,4.4535,1.0057,0.1269,0.3077,6.0313,1.2816,4.0139,0.9836,1.3438,2.0128,0.7199,0.1556,1.8376,4.3708,0.0014,6.2558,0.7379,0.0751,0.0001,1.6691,0.0124,1.926,1.7237,0.8472,2.7001,2.1849,2.8945,3.0404,3.471,5.0919,0.5575,1.4766,5.7411,2.0292,2.1839,1.1234,0.5599,2.0331,2.9484,0.5157,3.4482,1.0789,1.2556,4.361,0.6077,0.0601,0.0002,5.0404,0.3224,0.2682,2.8356,3.8559,1.7793,1.799,4.436,0.1552,3.5249,5.0494,4.2549,0.2284,2.5228,1.1648,3.1193,0.4511,3.218,7.2274,2.2974,1.3599,4.408,1.581,2.3424,0.8225,5.4388,4.7912,2.3524,3.1592,0.9129,4.9619,1.5884,0.8777,1.5387,3.7085,2.7467,1.0753,2.1611,5.7716,1.0634,1.8758,1.5589,0.0127,0.432,0.1208,0.0002,1.1665,2.1006,0.6405,4.7159,2.0358,2.1889,0.1386,0.3104,4.0281,3.1021,1.164,1.2172,5.9367,1.7155,5.0243,1.5912,4.9459,0.6889,3.2397,1.9364,0.8784,2.394,0.8127,6.4523,4.1416,1.0594,0.2614,1.9617,0.6511,2.3301,0.6435,1.2055,1.3703,1.6437,5.1344,6.1868,1.6928,3.4046,0.4768,2.2986,1.9769,0.5233,3.1932,0.2255,0.8312,4.7003,1.7058,1.4505,0.2233,2.6683,0.871,0.7869]}
{"id":801,"ended":false,"length":568,"gen_text":"There are many types of Mages in the world. Fire, Ice, Wind, Water, Death, Darkness, to name a few. But in this world, every type of mage is treated as equal. Everyone can be a good guy, no matter how dark your power. And anyone could be a bad guy, no matter how beautiful their ability...\n\nHowever, that is exactly what makes those kind of people interesting.\n\nEveryone knows...\n\nMage have powerful abilities, and those are the ones that can be used to save a life or a loved one.\n\nBut there are also kinds of mages that use their power and abilities to destroy people.\n\nThese are the ones that have completely twisted people's souls and will, but no one can defeat them because the ones who can control those powers has no limit... There are those who can have a very bad effect for others, and are completely unstoppable with their power... These are the ones who have made a huge difference.\n\nEveryone knows...\n\nIf the Mage is strong, the person with the worst talent are the most dangerous.\n\nThese are the ones that are feared by the world, and there are many reasons why we have to stop them.\n\nEveryone knows...\n\nThat those who make a difference must not be controlled, or be pushed to their limits.\n\n(It's not just about the type of Mage, although it is very important, but also the power they have, the weakness they have, and also the knowledge they have. Those who have knowledge will be the ones with ability to fight against the Mage! Those who have no knowledge, those who are weak will always be beaten by someone with knowledge, no matter what reason they had to lose )...\n\nThese are the same for everyone, and if you understand this, you will survive in this world, even though you can't go against the people you love and are loyal to. I won't lie, my little girl can't go against the people she loves.... I am a bit scared! But my little girl doesn't care about what I say....\n\nBut this doesn't mean that I can't be with my little girl anymore.\n\nBecause even after all that, this is still my story, and I still love her...... So, I want to continue writing my story... because if something happens to my little girl, I have a lot of things I can do without even going back to the old worlds.\n\nThis story will be written in one chapter every 3- 4 weeks. I hope that you will look forward to it, because I'll be releasing many many stories, more than 1 chapter per book.\n\nI'll let my little girl help me to make it better this time...\n\nI hope that you are still with me, and that you will keep reading this!\n\nYou may contact me via Facebook, E-mail, my mobile phone ( +234814937863 ), my Blog or Twitter","token_len":613,"entropy":[1.2101,2.4972,4.3319,0.0328,11.783,2.0268,1.0312,0.6557,1.6015,7.5224,1.3161,2.1205,0.0584,2.3829,0.1895,2.0193,0.2891,6.6183,0.3444,4.2796,0.3726,7.9183,0.0368,0.3322,0.0126,0.1366,2.7329,3.5451,1.7754,0.7818,0.4201,6.0062,2.3913,0.3556,1.905,1.1675,4.2663,1.0428,2.7566,0.6881,4.5588,2.1235,2.2623,0.8281,6.26,6.7722,1.498,5.1923,0.0918,2.3385,3.8196,3.287,5.0138,2.4472,3.2315,6.1725,4.5548,1.3204,0.4299,1.1688,0.0572,0.8913,1.0502,0.0014,0.1176,4.2452,0.6731,5.9736,5.6986,2.2516,0.0137,4.305,0.1518,3.2566,1.1767,4.5649,0.9662,2.8746,6.1698,4.1453,0.0526,2.0231,4.3007,0.397,1.3516,0.0001,5.1812,3.3428,6.5664,1.5186,0.0002,4.0574,1.525,6.214,5.2878,1.4722,1.295,1.9863,3.6789,2.6987,2.225,1.4019,1.2767,1.93,1.7074,0.8115,1.0641,4.5573,4.0029,1.6114,2.5474,2.5667,1.627,0.0167,0.2869,0.7904,0.0001,1.2636,2.4088,0.4317,0.9627,5.6601,0.2124,1.227,0.5076,2.6873,0.4663,1.0722,5.8628,1.8281,0.6501,2.2689,2.6771,1.088,0.4532,0.0002,3.7117,1.2589,0.2633,1.9853,0.6107,3.2361,5.7548,3.652,4.3907,0.1082,4.3137,2.1427,3.7375,2.4548,5.3236,3.673,0.3261,1.1763,5.2424,0.169,3.2259,3.5408,3.8501,1.0371,1.5985,4.3061,2.5911,1.793,6.6492,3.1021,3.7583,2.6662,6.2884,0.7117,2.6211,0.6784,1.1801,5.92,2.1559,4.8991,3.5775,2.2816,5.3377,1.5175,0.5652,1.0,4.9823,3.7432,4.7661,5.5874,0.6962,1.157,0.8307,4.0954,0.4182,0.2476,0.9356,0.9004,2.2776,4.1069,2.2868,3.3833,1.0413,4.356,0.2996,0.0002,4.5444,0.7732,0.8471,0.1848,0.0001,3.2796,3.3522,2.322,2.1373,2.2166,0.7889,1.0369,2.8723,2.8095,0.6252,4.4067,4.4326,6.0045,1.0445,2.1116,0.8383,0.5534,0.2819,0.0001,4.5651,0.5943,0.1188,1.1348,1.2786,2.1617,3.6285,1.2771,1.7663,1.675,1.7355,0.7628,4.279,0.6861,2.2421,4.0932,0.6331,5.6285,2.5912,1.7831,3.0752,0.1471,0.5129,0.2229,0.0002,4.1106,0.1642,0.0571,0.0154,0.0001,4.2872,3.4172,1.1578,5.3059,1.2381,1.112,3.983,2.5276,0.7657,4.8773,2.2622,2.3083,4.2978,5.1267,1.5246,1.7175,0.1776,0.5391,0.1702,0.0001,5.849,4.8112,0.7802,2.2432,1.8455,2.1873,1.9779,5.1406,0.0558,0.807,0.7968,5.7764,1.7259,0.8767,3.1693,0.1677,1.6203,0.4038,1.0077,1.3986,3.0399,2.084,0.8018,1.7503,2.1637,6.1853,0.5554,0.2539,0.3927,0.7679,2.9063,0.8464,5.34,0.2584,0.1454,1.3267,3.3962,1.3823,1.0248,2.3852,3.3597,0.9147,2.8607,0.9916,2.4787,6.4606,1.0938,2.8924,1.4574,1.2248,0.6743,6.7688,3.2244,0.3874,0.3603,3.8668,0.4014,1.6824,3.7252,0.3461,1.6995,0.7978,1.6183,4.1517,0.653,4.7721,1.0125,3.3387,1.3098,1.125,1.8996,3.4911,0.0296,1.3531,6.672,1.3705,4.0189,1.6154,2.8302,8.151,4.4462,0.5149,0.0001,4.2526,0.2257,0.1287,6.2671,4.2626,1.7054,1.1978,1.8276,3.2798,1.0925,4.7388,1.5251,0.3576,0.8662,0.6719,6.0125,2.141,0.2568,0.1749,2.5787,3.3661,3.1303,0.7112,3.5401,0.7614,4.4869,1.6747,0.7024,3.8772,2.8902,2.1919,3.136,3.3144,2.9592,0.0459,0.6082,6.0086,4.1673,0.0016,3.9641,1.498,4.9836,5.2705,4.1229,3.9615,0.865,3.1452,0.1635,1.837,0.4854,0.3629,0.3421,6.5464,3.1439,3.397,3.1478,3.4424,3.1892,4.939,2.5017,4.0382,0.7832,0.1331,3.7208,0.0004,1.748,1.0371,2.6224,2.1913,2.4257,3.6103,1.4594,0.0002,2.9371,3.7024,4.0605,0.0004,0.5463,0.8292,1.5341,1.8577,0.2613,2.7167,3.0718,1.5796,0.4785,0.0616,3.2159,1.073,0.8096,0.0001,2.9917,3.2098,4.6974,1.6,2.5734,1.146,4.093,1.2809,1.6484,0.7863,6.6027,1.9477,0.6811,1.145,3.0996,1.9385,0.9435,5.3557,4.6418,2.2791,0.915,3.1568,0.2458,2.9956,3.1959,2.3397,0.223,2.6797,5.2594,3.3759,6.1374,0.615,0.3509,1.2172,0.1745,0.0337,0.3558,0.6572,4.5084,3.5273,2.654,0.1959,1.633,1.0236,1.7608,0.4067,5.4156,4.7818,2.7287,2.4459,0.2934,1.2368,3.1916,7.075,0.8962,0.4624,0.0002,3.5648,2.2513,1.6766,1.1322,4.2335,1.0489,4.5797,2.8641,1.9451,3.3808,2.1382,6.1163,1.3496,0.8283,2.1258,2.278,2.1266,0.6375,0.8513,4.4562,0.0586,0.0544,0.6259,1.4003,2.3436,1.0465,4.4447,1.4547,4.968,3.9113,4.306,2.2137,2.2258,6.0362,0.4882,4.3534,1.6634,1.4841,6.2902,0.799,0.6994,0.0002,2.0019,2.4758,4.5485,3.2847,0.4519,0.2027,4.4783,0.1256,2.8851,3.0481,2.6797,1.8134,5.4344,0.0687,2.0251,0.9863,0.0002,2.3317,1.6834,1.6119,0.525,4.6439,2.3008,1.3548,0.0536,1.647,0.9523,1.6856,0.4923,0.9805,3.8666,1.0286,2.0592,4.0899,0.5203,0.0002,4.9513,3.1006,2.6718,0.0457,2.1529,3.4506,1.5963,4.176,0.0954,0.4131,0.4882,3.859,5.6143,0.8308,2.3401,6.0229,1.3228,0.5946,5.0402,4.6219,4.7682,1.8459,0.9762,2.6059,3.8631,1.9012,2.1874]}
{"id":2316,"ended":false,"length":568,"gen_text":"There are many types of Mages in the world. Fire, Ice, Wind, Water, Death, Darkness, to name a few. But in this world, every type of mage is treated as equal. Everyone can be a good guy, no matter how dark your power. And anyone could be a bad guy, no matter how beautiful their ability...\n\nHowever, that is exactly what makes those kind of people interesting.\n\nEveryone knows...\n\nMage have powerful abilities, and those are the ones that can be used to save a life or a loved one.\n\nBut there are also kinds of mages that use their power and abilities to destroy people.\n\nThese are the ones that have completely twisted people's souls and will, but no one can defeat them because the ones who can control those powers has no limit... There are those who can have a very bad effect for others, and are completely unstoppable with their power... These are the ones who have made a huge difference.\n\nEveryone knows...\n\nIf the Mage is strong, the person with the worst talent are the most dangerous.\n\nThese are the ones that are feared by the world, and there are many reasons why we have to stop them.\n\nEveryone knows...\n\nThat those who make a difference must not be controlled, or be pushed to their limits.\n\n(It's not just about the type of Mage, although it is very important, but also the power they have, the weakness they have, and also the knowledge they have. Those who have knowledge will be the ones with ability to fight against the Mage! Those who have no knowledge, those who are weak will always be beaten by someone with knowledge, no matter what reason they had to lose )...\n\nThese are the same for everyone, and if you understand this, you will survive in this world, even though you can't go against the people you love and are loyal to. I won't lie, my little girl can't go against the people she loves.... I am a bit scared! But my little girl doesn't care about what I say....\n\nBut this doesn't mean that I can't be with my little girl anymore.\n\nBecause even after all that, this is still my story, and I still love her...... So, I want to continue writing my story... because if something happens to my little girl, I have a lot of things I can do without even going back to the old worlds.\n\nThis story will be written in one chapter every 3- 4 weeks. I hope that you will look forward to it, because I'll be releasing many many stories, more than 1 chapter per book.\n\nI'll let my little girl help me to make it better this time...\n\nI hope that you are still with me, and that you will keep reading this!\n\nYou may contact me via Facebook, E-mail, my mobile phone ( +234814937863 ), my Blog or Twitter","token_len":613,"entropy":[1.2101,2.4972,4.3319,0.0328,11.783,2.0268,1.0312,0.6557,1.6015,7.5224,1.3161,2.1205,0.0584,2.3829,0.1895,2.0193,0.2891,6.6183,0.3444,4.2796,0.3726,7.9183,0.0368,0.3322,0.0126,0.1366,2.7329,3.5451,1.7754,0.7818,0.4201,6.0062,2.3913,0.3556,1.905,1.1675,4.2663,1.0428,2.7566,0.6881,4.5588,2.1235,2.2623,0.8281,6.26,6.7722,1.498,5.1923,0.0918,2.3385,3.8196,3.287,5.0138,2.4472,3.2315,6.1725,4.5548,1.3204,0.4299,1.1688,0.0572,0.8913,1.0502,0.0014,0.1176,4.2452,0.6731,5.9736,5.6986,2.2516,0.0137,4.305,0.1518,3.2566,1.1767,4.5649,0.9662,2.8746,6.1698,4.1453,0.0526,2.0231,4.3007,0.397,1.3516,0.0001,5.1812,3.3428,6.5664,1.5186,0.0002,4.0574,1.525,6.214,5.2878,1.4722,1.295,1.9863,3.6789,2.6987,2.225,1.4019,1.2767,1.93,1.7074,0.8115,1.0641,4.5573,4.0029,1.6114,2.5474,2.5667,1.627,0.0167,0.2869,0.7904,0.0001,1.2636,2.4088,0.4317,0.9627,5.6601,0.2124,1.227,0.5076,2.6873,0.4663,1.0722,5.8628,1.8281,0.6501,2.2689,2.6771,1.088,0.4532,0.0002,3.7117,1.2589,0.2633,1.9853,0.6107,3.2361,5.7548,3.652,4.3907,0.1082,4.3137,2.1427,3.7375,2.4548,5.3236,3.673,0.3261,1.1763,5.2424,0.169,3.2259,3.5408,3.8501,1.0371,1.5985,4.3061,2.5911,1.793,6.6492,3.1021,3.7583,2.6662,6.2884,0.7117,2.6211,0.6784,1.1801,5.92,2.1559,4.8991,3.5775,2.2816,5.3377,1.5175,0.5652,1.0,4.9823,3.7432,4.7661,5.5874,0.6962,1.157,0.8307,4.0954,0.4182,0.2476,0.9356,0.9004,2.2776,4.1069,2.2868,3.3833,1.0413,4.356,0.2996,0.0002,4.5444,0.7732,0.8471,0.1848,0.0001,3.2796,3.3522,2.322,2.1373,2.2166,0.7889,1.0369,2.8723,2.8095,0.6252,4.4067,4.4326,6.0045,1.0445,2.1116,0.8383,0.5534,0.2819,0.0001,4.5651,0.5943,0.1188,1.1348,1.2786,2.1617,3.6285,1.2771,1.7663,1.675,1.7355,0.7628,4.279,0.6861,2.2421,4.0932,0.6331,5.6285,2.5912,1.7831,3.0752,0.1471,0.5129,0.2229,0.0002,4.1106,0.1642,0.0571,0.0154,0.0001,4.2872,3.4172,1.1578,5.3059,1.2381,1.112,3.983,2.5276,0.7657,4.8773,2.2622,2.3083,4.2978,5.1267,1.5246,1.7175,0.1776,0.5391,0.1702,0.0001,5.849,4.8112,0.7802,2.2432,1.8455,2.1873,1.9779,5.1406,0.0558,0.807,0.7968,5.7764,1.7259,0.8767,3.1693,0.1677,1.6203,0.4038,1.0077,1.3986,3.0399,2.084,0.8018,1.7503,2.1637,6.1853,0.5554,0.2539,0.3927,0.7679,2.9063,0.8464,5.34,0.2584,0.1454,1.3267,3.3962,1.3823,1.0248,2.3852,3.3597,0.9147,2.8607,0.9916,2.4787,6.4606,1.0938,2.8924,1.4574,1.2248,0.6743,6.7688,3.2244,0.3874,0.3603,3.8668,0.4014,1.6824,3.7252,0.3461,1.6995,0.7978,1.6183,4.1517,0.653,4.7721,1.0125,3.3387,1.3098,1.125,1.8996,3.4911,0.0296,1.3531,6.672,1.3705,4.0189,1.6154,2.8302,8.151,4.4462,0.5149,0.0001,4.2526,0.2257,0.1287,6.2671,4.2626,1.7054,1.1978,1.8276,3.2798,1.0925,4.7388,1.5251,0.3576,0.8662,0.6719,6.0125,2.141,0.2568,0.1749,2.5787,3.3661,3.1303,0.7112,3.5401,0.7614,4.4869,1.6747,0.7024,3.8772,2.8902,2.1919,3.136,3.3144,2.9592,0.0459,0.6082,6.0086,4.1673,0.0016,3.9641,1.498,4.9836,5.2705,4.1229,3.9615,0.865,3.1452,0.1635,1.837,0.4854,0.3629,0.3421,6.5464,3.1439,3.397,3.1478,3.4424,3.1892,4.939,2.5017,4.0382,0.7832,0.1331,3.7208,0.0004,1.748,1.0371,2.6224,2.1913,2.4257,3.6103,1.4594,0.0002,2.9371,3.7024,4.0605,0.0004,0.5463,0.8292,1.5341,1.8577,0.2613,2.7167,3.0718,1.5796,0.4785,0.0616,3.2159,1.073,0.8096,0.0001,2.9917,3.2098,4.6974,1.6,2.5734,1.146,4.093,1.2809,1.6484,0.7863,6.6027,1.9477,0.6811,1.145,3.0996,1.9385,0.9435,5.3557,4.6418,2.2791,0.915,3.1568,0.2458,2.9956,3.1959,2.3397,0.223,2.6797,5.2594,3.3759,6.1374,0.615,0.3509,1.2172,0.1745,0.0337,0.3558,0.6572,4.5084,3.5273,2.654,0.1959,1.633,1.0236,1.7608,0.4067,5.4156,4.7818,2.7287,2.4459,0.2934,1.2368,3.1916,7.075,0.8962,0.4624,0.0002,3.5648,2.2513,1.6766,1.1322,4.2335,1.0489,4.5797,2.8641,1.9451,3.3808,2.1382,6.1163,1.3496,0.8283,2.1258,2.278,2.1266,0.6375,0.8513,4.4562,0.0586,0.0544,0.6259,1.4003,2.3436,1.0465,4.4447,1.4547,4.968,3.9113,4.306,2.2137,2.2258,6.0362,0.4882,4.3534,1.6634,1.4841,6.2902,0.799,0.6994,0.0002,2.0019,2.4758,4.5485,3.2847,0.4519,0.2027,4.4783,0.1256,2.8851,3.0481,2.6797,1.8134,5.4344,0.0687,2.0251,0.9863,0.0002,2.3317,1.6834,1.6119,0.525,4.6439,2.3008,1.3548,0.0536,1.647,0.9523,1.6856,0.4923,0.9805,3.8666,1.0286,2.0592,4.0899,0.5203,0.0002,4.9513,3.1006,2.6718,0.0457,2.1529,3.4506,1.5963,4.176,0.0954,0.4131,0.4882,3.859,5.6143,0.8308,2.3401,6.0229,1.3228,0.5946,5.0402,4.6219,4.7682,1.8459,0.9762,2.6059,3.8631,1.9012,2.1874]}
{"id":1777,"ended":true,"length":573,"gen_text":"Write a mythical story about an animal that is almost or has already gone extinct, and try to relate it to the human condition. It might be about how technology creates more scarcity, and therefore more scarcity makes the problems worse.\n\nAnother way to look at it is: If everything could be done on the internet, would anything be left for humans to do? As our society becomes more and more wired, it is inevitable that much less will be left for humans to do. The internet is the new fossil fuel that has just started to disappear from the earth.\n\nIn the US, we are facing an unprecedented rise in unemployment since 2007:\n\nAnd this is occurring at a time when we don't even have a long-term recovery plan in place:\n\nWith the US job market becoming more and more tight, can it be any wonder that many people are thinking long and hard about their future, and not just jobs?\n\nWhat's also really amazing about some of the figures above is that they make no sense! Take a look at the ratio of the unemployment rate for those under 35 to the total labor force.\n\nAnd that ratio is just too high! Here's why:\n\nLet's assume all the young people who enter the work force are able to find full-time employment. This is clearly not the case, as this ratio is simply huge:\n\nAt 50 percent, it's more than two-and-a-half times higher than it was just ten years ago, when our stock market bubble popped and our entire financial system started to implode.\n\nWe have a shortage of more Americans than people on our planet, meaning we literally are in a time crunch. One way to put things in perspective:\n\nThis shortage isn't going to go away, either. Young Americans are increasingly likely to enter the workforce at an older age (the gap is at its biggest in the late 60s):\n\nYou can actually see the same phenomenon happening in Canada, which is currently experiencing a massive shortage of highly educated workers:\n\nWith an increasingly larger number of the elderly and the young population coming into the labor force, we'll soon experience even more shortages, and possibly massive unemployment. There are simply too many millions of people who simply can't find jobs\u2026 and there are just a few people with the skills to fill them. I really want Millennials to be able to find work, but if it ends up being an even bigger shortage than it is today, this nation will be in disaster mode for a long long time.\n\nThere's good news and bad news:\n\nThis is great \u2014 the world just needed a little bit of change. It's good that millions of young people have the knowledge and drive to change the world around them. It's bad that we have a large number of people who lack the basic skills to make that happen today. This will likely continue in our economy for the rest of our lives, no matter how hard we work to get it fixed.","token_len":613,"entropy":[3.5497,12.8897,1.9868,1.7994,3.1595,4.4326,1.4713,2.2819,5.8676,6.05,4.3433,3.4357,3.1323,0.007,1.5799,1.1778,4.3305,0.1231,5.7343,0.293,0.1679,1.309,4.1154,2.817,0.4781,3.8524,3.0604,0.7128,2.8149,2.907,5.5154,5.2349,2.5102,4.953,1.0431,1.8732,3.8528,1.6235,2.9272,2.5138,2.7285,6.3027,0.6089,0.3969,1.878,0.0081,5.2326,2.1738,0.3954,2.1216,0.007,0.857,0.215,2.5581,2.8178,5.3858,4.1677,0.3623,3.6031,3.1674,1.9397,1.0428,0.2367,2.105,5.4673,1.3198,1.4563,2.3784,1.4959,0.8153,0.1045,0.1022,5.4228,4.5038,2.9904,0.9144,0.3222,1.6094,0.0009,4.928,0.5746,2.7666,2.3117,2.438,0.0551,6.1537,4.1012,1.041,0.3463,0.029,0.4457,0.9441,0.2864,0.067,0.3154,2.9528,2.8697,1.1102,2.2682,3.2013,5.0244,0.3412,3.915,3.1022,3.5385,2.1016,0.3716,4.1173,2.3573,0.2302,0.9662,0.4862,0.7203,0.0002,3.5092,1.4665,4.6549,0.3808,2.2242,1.3702,4.5588,2.2885,2.5977,5.4771,0.0913,3.1705,5.8462,2.8648,3.7165,1.028,0.0002,3.2868,3.0251,0.7264,5.1699,1.7589,0.5393,0.034,0.1531,2.3898,5.2489,0.0007,1.7276,0.5442,1.4101,5.408,0.1606,0.02,3.3507,1.5286,1.3166,0.0743,2.6835,0.0444,0.0002,5.3931,1.5657,3.0156,4.0281,0.3422,4.945,1.4004,0.5899,0.0011,5.0766,0.2714,6.1161,3.1716,0.8624,1.7989,0.5748,0.2373,3.2336,0.9097,0.3656,4.2672,4.6395,0.795,0.0159,0.0451,3.0516,1.9812,2.2437,0.7284,4.4027,1.1564,6.0644,0.3264,0.4487,0.0002,3.9848,2.6488,3.8104,4.5657,4.1503,1.342,7.2385,0.078,0.8348,5.0514,1.3163,0.1698,0.3108,1.0963,5.7659,2.9055,0.3143,4.8053,4.1093,2.113,0.1966,0.1079,0.9205,5.7537,0.11,2.0659,2.5754,0.1045,3.1442,3.1605,2.1067,2.6158,0.9846,0.3207,2.5446,2.8443,0.0077,1.7102,2.2019,0.0002,4.0,2.7649,1.7455,0.7872,4.242,3.8315,0.3692,1.1875,5.7187,0.5635,1.6352,0.2732,0.4364,0.0002,4.4522,0.0966,1.969,4.7349,1.5864,2.2017,0.2634,1.369,5.2023,0.067,3.5574,0.0084,1.7414,3.1043,0.0341,0.3398,3.9505,0.2976,0.0025,1.8048,0.7695,3.0363,1.0181,3.4005,0.1804,0.2902,0.0105,1.8627,1.1419,2.55,2.3497,1.2428,4.911,6.2691,1.4342,0.0464,0.0002,4.9909,6.741,2.6129,0.2639,1.9197,1.1699,3.4108,0.1989,4.6187,2.1084,0.4678,0.0012,0.0288,0.0075,0.008,0.0147,0.82,0.0349,1.4745,0.2302,2.9859,2.671,0.0227,0.0196,2.1839,1.6051,4.7523,6.3783,0.2438,1.6122,3.4559,1.4648,2.7509,3.7781,2.3666,0.0796,3.4053,0.5942,1.1359,0.0011,0.1873,0.4761,0.0002,3.9247,2.1249,1.8832,5.106,0.0274,4.732,7.1335,1.2577,3.5504,5.5565,3.2475,0.7387,2.2581,4.6725,1.281,5.5626,3.3714,2.9682,0.9457,5.5393,2.4637,0.5717,6.3139,2.4113,0.4697,3.044,3.6445,1.0072,0.0553,2.0655,1.4389,0.0002,4.1352,3.5281,5.1544,0.0003,2.2769,0.7445,1.0707,0.0044,2.6518,4.0746,0.4231,5.9263,1.2347,0.8847,5.8,2.725,0.0112,3.6182,0.3773,1.1768,2.1681,2.8368,0.8657,0.0087,3.9863,3.1249,5.58,1.7028,3.7296,1.1362,3.4376,1.5786,1.0034,4.3113,4.6972,0.1972,4.6235,0.0183,0.0002,5.3492,1.0183,4.9811,0.3674,1.5052,3.3456,2.7032,1.585,0.5765,3.917,1.0948,1.9963,0.9175,3.3683,0.8333,0.7404,2.1275,2.017,0.0664,5.3282,1.5689,0.7031,0.6305,0.0164,0.0002,4.5687,3.7925,3.6372,5.1988,2.1723,0.0047,4.838,5.937,2.3676,1.6238,1.6923,5.8348,4.2032,1.2177,0.0715,1.8169,0.1777,0.7923,1.6195,4.2796,2.1908,5.0083,4.5873,0.4892,2.3266,2.1323,1.3298,4.3641,5.58,1.562,0.4732,5.3989,1.5332,2.7651,1.4742,0.1788,6.3613,0.0663,1.0124,1.8572,1.8869,1.4706,0.005,0.1495,1.3842,5.5855,1.4018,2.7406,1.1889,2.7512,3.9153,1.1207,2.7092,3.0919,0.3379,1.0887,0.9537,0.4084,0.7589,0.2036,6.3206,4.8006,3.7173,8.7955,0.1676,2.2295,1.2738,0.0075,1.4236,2.0958,0.7166,0.3223,3.0227,3.0986,5.3339,0.017,0.6036,3.336,2.8103,2.4372,2.5836,0.439,1.3372,0.721,1.7259,0.0672,3.7792,5.802,1.0673,1.4054,0.6711,6.4255,1.0215,0.729,1.4116,1.4209,4.9178,0.0252,0.3098,0.1687,0.0002,3.9165,1.3448,6.2676,0.162,3.911,0.1154,0.0058,2.9611,0.6769,0.0001,5.297,1.3471,3.3746,7.4141,2.5122,3.8929,4.1468,4.8307,1.0923,1.6705,1.5442,0.6613,4.1906,0.9958,3.0789,0.5878,3.0381,0.9477,4.9252,0.0893,1.102,0.2811,2.6004,3.0085,4.6893,0.2408,3.8018,0.1158,3.1603,0.4723,0.3826,3.5682,0.0361,0.6457,2.2117,0.1179,2.0015,0.1917,1.8309,1.9049,1.851,4.6735,0.9241,0.0045,1.0173,0.7377,2.9964,0.7204,3.3351,0.4327,0.9695,3.649,2.177,0.798,6.2215,0.1727,3.7334,3.2615,3.6329,2.3959,4.7024,3.4053,3.1766,0.4603,1.4909,3.0328,0.0022,0.5392,0.2292,1.0459,4.3607,0.0074,0.8972,2.1303,0.2962,1.7045,0.9638,2.6708,2.7862,1.57,0.1267]}
{"id":803,"ended":true,"length":587,"gen_text":"Write a story that begins and ends with the same sentence in a way that it takes on a whole new meaning the second time....\n\nA story must begin and end on a new day\n\nThe story is the journey\n\nI'm also wondering how we can move through the experience in our time, as well as how we can have the experience.\n\nAnother person said of her experience:\n\n\"I felt a big sense of peace and wonder about this planet where I was. This realization seems to come to everyone who has visited or taken part in it. It's a feeling that can't be explained. The world is so much bigger and more amazing than anything that happened with us. A visit to a place may be your first real exposure to what a large planet is like. I felt that our journey into space was a little less than a week. There were days we were away from the ship where we were happy and content, and there were days when we had to say good-bye to some of the other settlers.... It turns out there is a lot we still don't feel confident about as we get ready to leave this planet. But we know that when we are free, we'll know where to go to find the answers to many of our questions.\" (Ella Shklovsky)\n\nThere are several more accounts we will not include here, and each of them is a true life story of awe at life on this world. They represent that the true meaning is always more than just the journey, but it's the journey-that we're on together as an eternal family that defines the meaning, and as each of us is on our own journey, their meaning changes. I feel that I must emphasize that a true story is not one we've written ourselves. Stories have power if we do not tell them often enough.\n\nThe story is the journey\n\nThe most difficult part of what you're attempting to do is this: to write with the sense of the meaning of your life, for yourself and others, in the language that will help you communicate that meaning. It's not enough to simply say \"I did it.\" What if that isn't what you mean to do? We're not going to get anywhere with our writing unless we truly mean what we're saying. We must write with the certainty that what we're about to write is true... to ourselves, to the universe, to our fellow humans, and to God, and to everything in the universe.\n\nThe journey to your experience of the mystery of life is a lonely one, that we are never alone in it, nor is it our own. One of the beauties of this journey is all of these other lives. We are also going there with other souls, on this journey together, one after another, one after another, together. We are traveling with the souls whom we will no longer choose and yet will not condemn in our journey.\n\nWe can begin to write our life stories... in their language.","token_len":614,"entropy":[3.5497,4.0087,3.7067,7.1822,5.229,0.0477,0.3482,1.5112,3.6855,2.0684,4.7133,2.066,1.8959,0.0637,5.2994,5.501,3.8894,0.7831,3.25,0.1714,0.1102,4.1712,0.9521,0.0829,11.0569,1.8214,0.0405,4.3562,2.1163,4.0691,2.4115,1.0037,0.0157,3.6873,0.7298,2.652,4.8182,3.6533,0.0001,3.1322,2.2904,3.3551,2.044,4.293,1.8811,0.0001,4.9253,2.6009,5.8083,5.9064,2.4097,3.6362,1.0047,5.1231,5.2885,1.1636,5.0375,3.4768,2.9082,6.1245,1.8426,3.3481,2.7153,0.0775,2.3719,0.4206,0.2784,4.6,1.8926,1.4115,3.1423,1.1328,0.0001,5.5937,5.0639,2.8433,6.1418,3.4945,1.4961,1.2098,0.3388,0.0002,1.3731,1.2727,2.8805,2.6639,5.9506,2.1216,0.0067,1.9516,1.2236,5.0097,3.2153,3.8855,3.6259,6.7245,0.5981,1.2301,1.8762,4.1307,6.397,6.0992,0.7667,2.02,2.1544,2.4717,2.0125,1.4019,4.6788,4.0304,5.4299,1.288,0.0524,3.9707,0.7427,1.6262,1.5455,1.6212,2.481,1.3501,3.5035,0.8726,0.0976,0.9616,1.7312,3.1389,3.4678,1.307,1.9219,2.1992,0.9559,1.797,0.5804,3.1145,0.1458,3.0925,3.1616,5.8073,6.3574,1.9747,1.4627,5.1061,5.8447,0.3647,2.2538,1.3547,6.9936,1.1892,4.7571,1.4422,3.4591,3.7021,0.0284,3.7236,3.8082,5.0731,2.6273,1.2278,0.6864,0.8943,2.4739,2.4345,2.2352,4.6809,4.2492,4.0093,1.4537,0.9387,1.6363,4.6093,3.1131,2.3956,1.1568,3.5315,1.7835,3.6792,1.8464,4.7568,3.3028,1.7135,5.6137,0.25,1.6008,2.6817,3.9492,0.7345,1.9722,4.9117,1.0459,2.2098,1.6101,1.0147,1.9423,0.0428,0.5067,1.3257,0.2874,2.6736,1.1371,5.373,2.4162,0.9596,0.0245,0.7055,3.7796,0.6822,0.6219,3.4551,6.8199,5.0359,3.2877,6.5088,0.0086,2.8748,1.6153,1.0591,1.0078,2.7943,2.7834,0.2602,0.0008,9.5316,5.2366,0.5977,4.2418,1.433,2.8163,3.5504,0.1867,0.5385,2.4765,0.7678,0.9054,2.7289,1.5778,2.8418,1.0392,3.6434,0.1716,2.6919,5.6038,1.5856,0.6412,2.0156,2.3765,4.9433,0.4855,0.2605,2.9516,1.3406,1.8973,0.1929,1.772,3.2745,0.1795,0.6793,0.3245,0.8326,4.4281,6.0509,4.6943,6.0005,5.3972,0.3251,0.5415,0.8439,0.1268,0.0002,4.2667,1.1499,3.9471,3.2294,4.9373,5.0193,3.8386,3.2329,1.8662,0.2712,0.9669,3.5841,4.9667,1.7526,0.7752,1.5313,1.9977,4.627,5.5505,0.8132,1.8537,5.981,5.0093,3.873,1.8273,1.9333,3.6422,0.5243,3.3051,4.2516,5.6599,3.5661,4.1821,1.1942,4.0935,4.512,3.4437,0.8481,2.0918,1.0596,2.5755,1.8204,1.4319,3.453,1.4777,0.8847,0.6347,7.3327,3.927,2.8296,3.1662,1.3325,1.325,2.7374,4.5926,5.1977,0.8474,2.3027,4.2284,1.0551,0.9883,3.5912,0.9958,4.9783,3.8718,0.76,0.2625,3.1836,3.5325,1.2041,0.2211,0.6967,0.6694,6.8023,3.0878,3.3856,0.7882,4.5633,4.3926,1.3529,4.334,3.2848,3.5287,0.9065,4.8057,2.0071,2.2681,0.9223,1.3714,3.6956,3.518,4.2624,3.4064,2.5762,1.2919,3.7106,3.3215,3.598,4.6108,1.0171,5.219,0.8055,2.6717,0.1297,5.166,0.1977,0.7967,1.2392,0.0002,2.5893,3.3654,1.079,0.9619,0.3753,0.432,0.0002,2.3069,3.9632,4.1777,0.8982,0.3917,5.5359,3.6165,1.493,5.8959,0.5341,0.6694,0.4539,5.3491,0.465,2.082,3.3327,6.0634,1.9264,5.2748,0.459,2.3772,4.7975,1.056,1.7884,1.6048,2.1477,4.934,1.7372,0.7394,1.5171,1.1765,1.8335,1.3228,3.047,1.6251,2.8466,3.3091,0.8923,2.655,1.8277,0.5182,1.0886,2.9811,0.8332,1.6555,1.8806,0.2721,2.7915,2.2241,1.6179,0.666,4.4739,1.7225,1.3376,3.4764,3.1412,3.0066,4.2187,0.0004,3.0661,0.5465,1.7998,2.1638,1.4684,0.221,4.6978,3.1607,1.9331,2.9464,0.0269,2.1618,1.3131,2.3732,2.4383,2.4259,2.2368,0.0874,5.4929,2.6551,0.8235,0.0162,1.3623,0.4094,0.447,2.5776,1.4066,3.1592,1.0592,0.9208,5.059,0.4772,2.2445,0.0595,1.0065,4.6649,0.0369,1.1784,0.6003,1.2043,6.0053,5.2863,0.6446,1.4292,0.5604,2.3332,3.4883,0.1931,1.126,2.5787,1.1183,1.6168,0.5614,0.4407,0.2553,3.1789,3.4219,1.6677,0.881,2.5513,1.7505,2.9521,0.3058,0.2183,0.7044,0.0002,2.4922,3.0495,3.7258,3.3318,4.9558,1.8332,1.8701,5.7983,0.4745,0.5758,0.6499,1.8181,5.629,0.7756,1.1059,6.327,3.0091,2.6229,6.2132,0.9066,1.1626,2.0865,1.39,4.2261,2.5367,0.7926,4.2283,1.6748,1.36,5.7578,0.8033,0.1678,4.8121,0.0004,0.0846,2.1864,1.6119,0.19,6.8772,1.4264,3.9311,1.5224,3.3235,3.0962,1.5558,1.2492,5.97,4.3482,6.9511,1.5885,2.6222,2.8621,1.0789,4.6357,2.0639,1.032,1.745,1.2855,5.0996,4.5153,0.4454,1.0377,2.8358,1.6762,0.0323,0.8786,5.3873,0.8342,1.7631,0.7598,4.1191,1.3827,2.236,3.1135,6.9034,0.1562,2.5421,5.9828,0.7382,6.453,4.9906,5.6389,1.6597,3.5076,5.1872,4.0538,1.9468,4.5104,0.6971,1.7102,0.0002,2.559,3.0372,4.7029,1.1306,2.6588,2.2624,3.7109,0.6839,5.8558,3.1202,5.3762,1.4322,1.2363]}

If the player is still not yet in the timeline, he will have seconds to rewind. The effect is only triggered by interacting with a checkpoint while rewinding time. If you use your time machine on a world with no checkpoints, it will be the same as the current checkpoint.\n\nThe countdown timer can be reset manually by the player, by shooting the lever located at the left side, and again by using your time machine.\n\nThe time machine can be used for three different types of travel. The first travel is by driving it and flying to another world from the current one. The second one is by changing your time machine shape (in order to fly to another planet where the time machine is located). The final travel is by using a time machine only to travel to your own world. This ability is known as time travel.\n\nThe player is able to choose between eight different time periods (the two time periods after the time machine is placed, and after three more jumps will occur). During one time period, the player will have 30 seconds to rewind time if necessary, until 15 seconds after the time machine is placed on the planet, when time rewind will end. After the time machine is placed, the player will be able to travel to different locations on the planet, where time travel takes place. At different destinations, time travel can take place by interacting with a checkpoint. The player will have 60 seconds before his or her current checkpoint disappears. Additionally, after certain events occur, the player will not have any means of travel. He or she will travel to a random location on the planet.\n\nThe time machine will teleport the player to a random area on the planet, where time travel is possible. The player can enter the machine without touching the lever by pressing. While the time machine is on the planet's surface, the player can only interact with the side control panels located near the lever. To interact with the lever, press. The time machine has no visible indication in the world that reveals the presence of the lever. The time machine is automatically destroyed when the lever is removed, but it can still be returned to the time machine room by talking to the lever's operator.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe time machine can be used to travel to several \"other worlds,\" also including areas that are not possible to reach with the use of the time machine itself - such as time travel to a new dimension, in the case of Earth, or to a parallel dimension in the case of Neptune.","token_len":614,"entropy":[3.305,3.0612,2.9832,0.0651,6.1129,2.1717,0.4578,3.4846,1.1127,3.622,1.465,5.1874,4.1428,3.7784,8.7237,0.2518,0.8939,1.8644,0.0033,8.1087,8.9818,0.4063,8.2611,3.4711,3.1637,1.9943,3.1339,2.5055,0.2833,0.0046,2.2247,0.703,4.1968,0.946,3.3285,0.1309,4.4496,0.8585,3.6706,5.9536,0.0478,1.8354,0.4137,0.6834,0.0001,5.1769,0.1172,0.002,0.7588,0.0037,0.0065,0.0018,5.6493,0.5922,0.0002,0.001,0.0009,2.0297,5.5361,5.0195,4.3179,1.1528,3.6621,5.9396,3.4555,3.4612,0.2436,0.6139,4.2136,2.5903,5.3881,0.1148,4.3623,1.0034,4.2488,1.5969,1.4427,2.4676,3.5671,4.7268,5.7693,1.7966,0.3862,6.1535,0.6309,2.102,1.3681,2.6532,5.2153,0.0413,0.4841,1.6821,0.0119,1.9994,0.4061,0.0002,8.4318,2.3115,0.2553,0.01,0.0024,0.012,0.0025,0.1596,0.0025,0.003,0.0024,0.0102,0.0036,0.001,0.0013,0.0013,0.0012,0.0012,0.0027,0.003,0.0032,3.5347,0.0008,0.0097,0.0001,0.0009,1.5084,3.8359,1.9681,3.0378,3.2873,1.7848,6.0566,0.0207,1.8254,2.402,4.5834,2.2218,0.0218,0.0041,0.39,0.2364,2.8768,2.656,3.6633,4.2771,2.3693,1.7444,3.1518,0.6683,5.0335,1.6122,1.2758,0.2421,0.266,2.0645,0.3806,3.0038,4.8567,1.3334,0.3215,2.3099,2.9843,0.4206,0.4733,0.5405,0.0002,2.4482,5.4971,0.773,3.0731,0.3269,2.284,3.9764,0.6834,3.6349,0.252,2.4308,1.625,5.3126,1.5318,4.5156,3.8601,1.8584,0.0634,3.3409,0.8443,4.9023,2.5184,4.1219,0.2957,2.6792,2.5851,0.0629,0.0085,0.4315,0.63,0.0002,1.8215,2.1543,0.3041,1.5512,0.496,1.2965,3.1884,5.311,1.4929,2.7255,0.0035,2.3246,1.6437,2.1511,1.6568,3.0231,1.6343,2.2978,5.7606,1.6912,4.2092,4.5671,2.1231,2.881,1.012,4.7635,0.8157,1.2505,0.5508,0.3148,0.4829,0.1626,3.884,0.1642,0.2989,5.5645,2.87,1.1927,0.0615,6.3738,2.4217,3.9959,2.586,0.0614,2.1541,1.3738,0.6376,4.0598,6.238,1.4418,1.5224,0.0277,0.9518,1.3321,1.4315,0.3967,2.8415,0.5479,0.3381,0.233,1.9177,2.4262,2.0578,0.1476,6.638,1.5105,1.4173,0.7495,4.0807,1.8243,1.2561,0.5936,3.5179,5.568,1.0053,4.2935,0.0805,2.6765,0.5801,0.7036,0.5437,0.0002,1.8285,1.8834,2.9468,1.2244,0.0051,4.298,1.5824,5.7017,0.8717,1.1495,2.2957,2.9104,3.2279,5.3723,2.9084,0.1407,3.5506,0.4366,3.1927,0.4238,1.811,3.9715,1.8539,0.8783,3.0842,5.5855,3.5981,4.9468,4.8473,4.728,0.9277,4.2397,4.8606,1.8079,0.0204,0.409,0.5601,0.3427,1.4685,2.0319,3.1551,0.0664,0.2213,1.234,0.0013,0.3817,4.2715,3.7817,1.5682,5.4328,6.4123,0.0514,2.6609,0.2695,2.1235,0.3188,1.2049,1.1396,3.5351,0.215,2.5974,2.5925,3.0257,2.9956,3.3355,0.5301,1.4251,1.8317,0.2123,3.2605,1.4515,1.5118,0.0849,0.8656,0.7636,0.7093,0.7067,0.4804,0.8289,1.6703,0.6113,0.0055,1.1158,1.0706,3.415,3.7925,1.8751,0.3466,0.3626,1.4321,3.9002,2.355,0.7849,3.8793,0.1671,0.3959,5.0597,5.4412,5.4107,0.3148,1.6572,0.3397,2.015,1.9925,0.084,3.4835,4.1592,0.0253,1.2438,0.6782,1.5986,2.0574,1.1146,1.4556,1.7562,3.3995,0.0208,3.1351,3.2186,3.1432,0.0123,1.8158,0.7664,4.226,0.9356,5.7098,0.0214,3.2729,5.8433,2.2163,1.8562,0.4591,0.6911,0.5012,0.4964,3.3173,1.8973,1.948,6.322,0.6363,1.7616,1.7551,4.4452,0.3954,0.0025,0.3302,5.5323,0.9841,1.4239,2.5493,0.8543,0.6035,0.1087,0.106,1.3774,1.056,0.0003,1.4435,1.7548,0.0347,2.8434,4.2941,0.3931,0.0391,0.4343,1.1479,1.1157,4.372,1.0296,0.1549,0.1135,1.3452,1.4266,1.2687,0.0347,3.3493,0.6083,0.2722,1.5089,0.6599,1.4504,4.4798,0.9069,3.8099,3.9824,4.4337,0.8086,0.6363,4.2369,2.2142,6.9703,4.659,1.5655,1.827,0.0168,0.1124,3.2666,0.1581,0.0559,4.4703,0.0342,0.0657,0.5487,0.1952,0.7996,3.3788,2.49,0.0448,0.6107,6.394,4.9982,3.1062,1.9813,2.6983,0.1329,2.2482,0.504,4.0528,2.4805,0.0325,0.2324,1.3639,0.2302,2.4208,1.2336,1.5354,1.8258,0.0147,3.6091,2.6019,4.7101,4.7413,4.7976,0.5526,1.8403,3.3189,5.4444,1.3218,5.2316,0.0468,0.6933,0.2789,0.42,1.7882,1.8658,0.0208,2.3101,3.5559,3.4807,1.031,0.5516,1.5723,0.0648,2.2578,2.157,2.1059,1.7355,1.002,1.6536,0.0446,4.9731,0.1474,0.3812,4.3808,0.0249,1.8891,1.0692,5.5552,0.0476,0.626,3.1441,1.9696,1.7344,0.5488,0.6434,0.0003,4.6312,1.08,0.0002,0.9688,0.9549,0.0309,2.5022,0.4967,0.8298,0.483,0.4018,0.5803,4.4468,6.0298,3.6072,1.1427,3.5558,5.3533,5.8115,5.8111,1.5831,0.9743,1.3659,4.8431,0.4617,1.5277,2.6768,1.1771,3.6899,0.002,0.7758,1.2817,0.0836,2.2022,5.7407,1.4817,0.0089,4.6604,1.0867,1.239,2.0705,5.2275,2.9863,1.2096,5.3277,2.2826,1.3521,0.1001,5.977,1.6262,0.3916,1.2462,1.2023,1.8991,2.1077,1.7697,0.1477,0.0338,0.0017,5.5432,0.4339]}

If you fight back, you WILL lose.\n\nDo NOT try to fight with the police or your own attorney because the police and the attorneys know how to manipulate and control you into giving them everything they want.\n\nYou want to use your gun? Then shoot yourself in the head.\n\nIf the cops and your lawyers are successful with the court and are allowed to beat you into the deal, then the gun laws will be rewritten so everyone can buy an automatic weapon and have the right to kill everyone, so you will have nothing to lose by getting a gun yourself.\n\nIt is important to understand that there will not be anyone left to pay for the crimes of the American Mafia.\n\nThe most horrible thing about living in the United States is the fact that your children, their children (and great grand children) may be your slaves. How can you explain that to kids without any type of moral compass.\n\nEven if you could somehow make it to the future, if your soul ends as you are living now, that soul will not be able to come back into this body and that soul will die very slowly from lack of sunlight, air and exercise.\n\nThat is why our soul cannot live in this body but is chained at the wrists to serve God in Satan's body which is supposed to be a prison.\n\nThat is why the Bible says you will be released at the end of this life (2 Timothy 4:3) so you will have the opportunity to escape with your children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, great great grandchildren, great great great grandchildren, etc.\n\nHow can anyone look at that list and say the American Mafia is not at the top of that list?\n\nDo you even wish you were alive right now if you can't afford a bulletproof vest?\n\nEven if you could afford one, that would only make the world's worst gangsters even more powerful. The Americans have more than enough ammunition.\n\nOur military is being drained by the American Mafia.\n\nIf people knew what was happening, they would want us out of their country.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am not advocating our overthrow \u2014 merely that we take a different political path. But until we change the current government, we have to continue to fight against the American Mafia.\n\nIt is the only way we can take our own country back.\n\nWhen you see the American Mafia in action, it is no longer a metaphor in the sense of something that exists outside our minds.\n\nThis is reality.","token_len":614,"entropy":[3.0403,11.7928,1.6928,8.0363,0.6068,2.2991,1.5447,2.9978,8.0072,2.3338,6.5122,0.0186,0.0002,0.0116,0.6236,2.7502,0.018,6.9838,2.8989,3.9077,4.808,0.9518,0.9865,1.4783,4.5882,0.8746,1.0018,0.0271,3.0344,1.3145,2.7614,1.6761,1.2995,5.998,1.5548,1.5855,4.7132,0.7043,5.2614,1.5271,4.4623,0.6575,2.2381,3.7899,2.6164,0.2307,0.2616,0.754,0.0001,2.7913,0.5064,3.687,1.6997,3.3501,1.8664,1.6375,1.7279,1.8015,5.487,1.1335,2.2716,4.6066,0.3283,1.1573,0.2862,4.2495,4.7885,0.8051,0.0375,0.0886,2.0413,1.9723,4.0983,0.562,0.3445,1.7889,0.1284,1.2197,0.0426,0.1329,0.5313,0.4993,0.0002,4.3014,0.0136,5.6497,2.4185,3.6344,1.1448,0.5135,2.1012,0.7455,2.5943,0.1715,1.7501,0.0755,0.469,0.4789,6.7741,0.0898,0.2826,0.5018,0.0002,3.4596,3.3315,2.9194,0.0823,3.3445,4.3591,1.2763,0.8699,1.6032,4.1494,3.8503,4.7387,2.619,2.2521,0.5092,1.9023,1.8046,2.434,4.0578,2.8162,0.5715,2.6189,2.2868,1.9355,0.9114,3.3413,1.7804,0.9372,1.9353,0.4819,0.0829,0.3891,0.4647,0.0002,2.8504,4.3442,0.4544,5.6004,2.0434,1.8572,2.5821,3.1601,2.9124,0.1245,0.4658,0.0227,0.0856,0.5037,0.3943,0.0002,1.6961,3.4609,2.9956,2.0414,2.1005,4.1932,1.9635,5.7037,4.5366,2.7439,3.2689,2.5184,5.2095,3.376,0.0412,5.6917,0.2726,1.148,3.9916,5.9429,1.1656,1.358,2.2972,2.6709,6.4674,0.7923,0.6209,4.5988,1.9658,5.8187,1.3592,2.6996,4.7309,0.9014,0.6398,1.4453,2.9491,2.676,1.2297,0.0143,1.1341,3.1928,4.0811,4.4807,1.5153,1.4082,1.3244,2.3478,0.6005,0.0797,1.7043,4.2665,1.6865,0.1732,4.0511,0.3548,0.1605,0.0002,4.3639,0.662,3.4953,0.4893,1.712,0.3075,3.2808,2.9579,3.492,0.0393,3.8855,2.0245,0.6467,4.6251,0.6268,1.4375,3.1358,1.4976,0.5132,5.4002,4.6011,1.0118,0.9171,0.0002,1.7446,5.8201,5.3935,1.327,0.9798,5.6894,0.2512,1.6789,0.884,0.0026,0.7162,2.0212,1.4109,0.0302,3.3589,2.5522,2.5922,5.3832,0.0842,6.9168,1.2013,5.9336,2.3191,0.4145,0.6312,4.3588,1.2132,5.2376,2.615,0.7902,6.7041,1.4137,0.5876,3.4132,1.3063,0.0933,7.1356,6.572,3.4117,5.4521,0.0033,3.518,0.9395,3.1557,0.5447,0.0002,5.3534,0.7287,0.5934,4.5894,4.1295,3.742,0.8605,0.9956,1.7784,4.2545,0.5608,4.1164,1.8505,6.6032,5.2456,6.1642,1.6934,1.234,1.8514,1.2372,0.2207,4.6016,1.9287,0.3125,2.3715,0.7795,0.8926,0.0031,3.8073,0.1017,2.9378,1.4584,2.9811,2.4407,4.4178,2.2765,0.2158,2.5884,6.6832,4.026,3.5736,2.3868,0.0015,6.3808,1.7661,2.4783,1.0767,3.6959,0.2792,0.3365,0.0002,3.7161,0.9005,0.7985,5.6021,4.2844,3.3397,2.9602,0.9984,1.3991,0.3942,4.7237,2.7967,5.5156,6.3178,0.19,2.151,1.7917,5.3513,3.6566,2.3835,6.8406,0.0383,1.7222,4.4543,0.616,6.0392,0.0025,0.3879,1.8119,0.9995,0.9986,0.3348,0.0002,3.469,0.3467,0.2656,2.3236,2.3923,0.6164,3.8315,1.4804,0.9842,5.2895,3.691,0.3754,0.6938,0.0661,2.8774,1.9119,3.097,2.4416,2.8128,0.6989,0.013,1.6448,1.3647,2.8534,0.9065,1.4693,1.9411,2.5416,0.9463,0.0344,4.2659,5.1671,0.5691,3.8255,2.8301,1.2315,0.9783,0.6268,0.483,0.9007,0.5165,0.2369,0.313,0.816,0.95,0.1183,0.2394,0.7143,0.5606,1.8341,0.3143,0.3463,0.0002,4.5326,1.2179,3.3761,4.892,0.5283,1.762,4.3768,0.4536,1.8459,4.0121,1.1782,0.3595,0.7889,1.1924,4.4915,1.2941,0.2759,0.4091,1.0937,0.0118,0.3925,0.31,0.0002,4.2631,0.732,4.7708,6.6444,3.1447,1.1582,2.1373,2.3784,0.0066,4.5786,0.286,4.6392,0.6978,4.9735,1.8503,4.0408,1.0849,1.001,0.9942,0.2756,0.0002,4.8136,0.3425,0.2649,1.4471,1.5423,1.614,0.188,4.0455,1.1065,1.8405,2.7697,2.419,5.2034,4.8411,2.1505,2.8171,0.676,1.4917,0.7853,1.111,1.1753,3.9871,5.0416,1.5698,3.0313,2.97,0.5488,3.4534,2.185,0.2577,0.0002,5.0224,5.0399,0.9669,3.5552,3.6342,1.934,1.5715,1.3183,0.0671,1.3842,1.1438,0.0002,3.1943,5.9231,3.0432,1.5129,1.1313,1.3208,1.5995,0.8647,0.1577,3.6908,3.5129,1.5227,0.1578,1.939,0.3542,0.6508,0.4046,0.0002,5.1168,0.0055,3.1468,0.66,0.0758,0.6674,0.8469,1.233,0.4589,2.6742,5.7325,4.9725,7.9463,5.1706,1.0771,0.4937,3.9224,2.0674,2.687,5.6941,1.2545,0.6648,4.6545,4.966,0.9636,3.3705,0.8451,3.7175,2.1561,0.4425,1.0767,2.8957,0.7019,3.586,0.6394,2.3374,3.0703,0.8804,0.4477,0.0117,0.5067,0.1928,0.0002,3.4647,0.4059,2.8779,1.4036,0.267,1.095,0.4563,4.4029,2.5363,4.4632,1.1794,0.0354,0.6218,0.2952,0.0002,4.1908,1.5838,2.5056,1.4577,1.3777,0.0878,2.1287,0.6836,0.2072,2.1111,0.5181,4.6872,0.9718,1.0574,3.7589,6.0546,1.997,2.3021,1.7914,3.9611,1.3733,3.9966,2.7088,3.0856,2.7731,0.4172,1.1646,0.0002,4.4051,0.5811,2.8235,0.4219]}
{"id":3925,"ended":true,"length":587,"gen_text":"We believed they were stars. They weren \u2019 t. They never asked for that s ix \u2016 or twelves of dollars to do something so basic and simple as watch a movie.\" That was the beginning of the end, she says, as she tried unsuccessfully to get her daughter out.\n\n\"I said [to them], 'Just watch the movie. Just go away,' \" Ms. Miller recalls. \"I told him it would take a couple of minutes to get him back into it. So then I picked up the remote and the TV and I said, \u2019 'I want you to go to see this movie. Just watch it, please! \u2019 And they asked what was up. I asked, \u2019 'Well, what makes you think he's doing this, Mr. Moore?'\u2019 and they weren't sure. They said, 'It's just a suggestion.' \"\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\"I said, 'Listen, you are in control of our lives. You want me not to have a kid, fine, you can have me not to have a kid. That's your choice, too.' \"\n\nShe says her daughter, then 3 \u00bd, had already developed a strong attachment to the television, \"so she just turned it off\" once her father had left the room. He got the same reaction from her two older brothers, who never complained as they watched the movie. Then it was her elder sister who refused.\n\n\"I said, 'You can't do that,' and she went and got the remote,\" Ms. Miller remembered.\n\nNow she is waiting with increasing concern. One of the questions she asks is: How long before I am forced to give her the child back?\n\nHe may be a monster, she knows, but maybe there is a reasonable explanation. The child, she says, is so smart he knows it was bad for him to start watching that movie. He thinks he can escape by watching, or not watching until the movie starts again. Either way, \"he'll turn the TV off,\" her mother says. \"And even as you're sitting there waiting for him, he knows he's never coming back.\"\n\nWhat should she do with the case now? Should she ask for visitation? Can she persuade him to let her see the child? What about the case for child support?\n\n\"I mean, I'm just not sure what to do,\" Ms. Miller says. She knows it is unlikely that Moore would voluntarily return the child, given what he knows about her. But she thinks that if he refuses custody, she can at least persuade the courts to give the couple visitation.\n\n\"A loving relationship with a real family is far better than being abused by a monster, and I want to see that,\" she says. \"This way we'll be together.\"\n\nThe courts, no doubt, will look at her differently. It may be as simple as that.","token_len":614,"entropy":[8.3411,4.0131,0.8282,10.2017,1.8372,2.1551,3.6494,16.1984,9.9977,9.7486,5.3145,1.4836,6.0179,4.9451,1.1487,5.275,7.2875,5.2957,0.6704,3.9081,2.0987,3.5057,5.7145,1.8101,2.9198,2.75,1.3681,3.2405,2.1529,3.922,3.9322,3.1916,2.2871,2.8955,1.3277,5.3993,1.1673,1.1208,1.9023,5.5356,2.2946,1.7456,3.3458,0.0716,1.2546,1.1181,2.3889,2.7519,1.1627,1.2604,3.3546,2.4457,3.9695,4.5857,0.104,1.3844,2.5381,3.2434,3.3912,2.6275,1.254,0.0022,1.7349,1.4204,4.212,6.1872,0.2638,2.5701,0.4084,0.2785,4.9991,2.0918,0.7978,0.158,0.964,2.906,3.1089,4.9253,3.7074,0.3062,3.0317,0.0028,5.6022,1.6518,0.1318,0.3774,1.6028,2.8974,3.4554,4.1281,2.6137,3.1209,2.1406,2.5316,0.4159,1.6687,2.014,1.472,3.6022,3.9554,2.0573,2.08,0.8858,3.9921,4.4433,0.735,5.562,0.4724,0.5803,2.7474,0.6981,3.9188,2.0736,1.5344,1.6092,1.7356,0.2349,4.9409,0.76,1.3797,2.3388,2.8071,0.4203,0.2111,2.3889,1.9311,6.2855,1.3929,0.2864,1.1028,3.6781,1.726,0.6646,2.3819,3.1336,4.879,3.3006,0.4605,3.497,2.4091,5.7435,3.4125,2.4145,4.1981,1.2978,0.8168,5.7913,1.706,1.2383,0.034,0.7269,3.9956,0.0923,1.117,6.0348,0.1408,0.2537,4.2002,0.842,5.2584,1.158,3.4707,4.4829,0.01,5.5815,0.7764,4.6544,2.1417,3.3253,0.7673,6.9223,0.0185,1.4434,1.0083,2.2977,1.3973,0.3165,0.4161,4.1103,0.5639,1.3157,1.7795,5.7381,1.0372,1.2505,0.2136,0.0002,3.9312,0.0657,0.0003,0.0003,0.0001,0.0003,0.0007,0.0004,2.5565,1.3651,0.9365,0.0985,0.3426,5.7554,0.2478,2.0911,3.7161,3.1536,3.8939,0.6305,4.0158,1.7806,0.9648,0.994,4.2438,2.5749,5.9622,0.0142,3.1615,1.46,2.4483,2.0582,1.7769,1.7568,3.0677,1.0296,1.0082,2.7092,0.8292,1.6532,0.0303,0.0634,0.0304,1.0335,3.9458,0.1039,0.5944,0.7947,2.2194,5.225,2.6038,0.9344,0.4251,0.0002,2.8876,1.4006,2.5184,0.5931,2.0921,3.114,3.2582,4.1529,0.2505,3.393,3.0871,4.1403,0.7395,3.8215,2.3319,0.0249,0.9198,3.1084,1.6232,4.6088,1.5422,2.4209,3.8118,4.5831,1.3107,0.3178,3.2785,3.5564,2.1321,0.9545,2.8007,1.3654,0.897,0.0665,0.1185,4.6758,5.0151,2.4496,3.692,2.2963,0.8279,1.7067,3.7396,2.0582,1.4459,0.7285,1.4137,5.0414,5.5381,6.1075,1.6709,0.5153,1.359,0.7294,0.8627,5.7532,2.8067,0.5072,2.0002,5.3964,0.4698,2.2182,4.0516,2.7797,0.6094,0.0003,0.4154,1.5843,1.0971,0.1512,0.0742,2.0863,1.7981,0.6385,1.9793,0.3584,1.516,1.1257,0.2438,4.6049,2.7702,1.2152,1.118,0.7812,1.4927,0.2311,0.0007,0.0093,6.6146,0.0791,1.592,0.0002,4.9135,2.6799,1.587,5.1936,3.8131,4.9166,3.8203,2.3383,5.4449,0.9129,1.4406,5.3814,0.7222,2.4495,2.1161,1.6826,2.3117,1.3468,2.0926,5.7652,3.4352,2.448,0.0868,3.6974,3.043,3.434,2.8826,1.0705,0.2007,0.7066,0.0002,6.1593,4.4445,1.3525,1.9136,3.1424,0.264,0.9972,3.5074,0.4794,0.1525,5.5129,3.1421,0.519,1.1219,5.7042,0.1382,0.8793,3.7429,4.3893,2.2272,0.6005,0.8454,0.0548,1.5741,4.2215,3.966,3.3934,3.7825,3.8708,3.1493,4.6886,1.1892,0.2586,0.2869,5.8583,0.6841,3.5637,0.9272,0.7688,2.2144,5.7236,1.4848,2.3978,5.2047,2.4776,2.7637,5.5003,3.5824,4.5925,0.496,8.1652,2.0346,2.5188,4.5385,1.3324,0.3423,6.2884,0.1349,0.0628,4.5165,1.2202,2.8491,6.0447,2.7991,0.4727,0.8316,1.345,4.6607,0.8867,0.4486,0.2509,1.7459,1.9231,6.095,5.6527,4.776,1.333,2.7142,0.3988,3.7313,0.7667,0.717,1.9553,0.9565,4.2492,1.5603,0.6567,4.8813,1.6373,0.1772,0.3143,0.6888,0.0003,4.8463,3.9709,0.923,0.0655,4.2616,0.9789,6.7275,1.948,0.4166,2.9114,0.1275,4.6391,1.0997,4.0049,1.4364,4.9376,0.4273,4.8114,1.6016,0.1352,3.5276,0.2176,1.4588,1.2695,0.4899,0.6109,3.3026,1.6689,1.5739,3.8532,1.9283,1.519,0.1846,0.1472,0.9508,0.0002,1.0196,0.9788,5.0762,0.1512,1.6903,1.8777,2.5814,3.3205,1.1285,1.1628,0.6649,0.0341,0.4259,0.8838,0.0007,0.0338,0.4381,0.1588,3.8318,3.3534,3.0378,1.0926,3.0129,0.748,3.3659,1.7336,3.9922,1.5954,0.5691,0.1567,1.0529,3.8327,2.5677,0.9817,2.579,1.15,0.9191,1.0739,1.1021,1.0525,3.723,2.4073,1.2945,1.0619,4.6599,3.9791,0.2829,0.9971,2.3499,2.1982,0.0047,3.585,2.2081,1.4381,0.3279,2.8458,2.2596,6.0981,2.6544,1.0652,0.6483,0.0002,1.1283,5.7392,6.0612,2.9049,1.438,0.9896,6.3665,3.9425,1.2861,4.6011,1.1679,0.2242,3.1759,4.8928,0.7849,0.8588,0.7087,3.0283,1.5963,1.0181,2.3416,0.6997,2.3406,0.971,1.6383,0.1581,0.0953,0.0474,0.714,4.8427,5.5803,2.7607,2.3079,1.7517,2.0048,1.3425,0.6635,0.0002,3.1225,4.795,1.8715,6.6993,0.1882,0.1148,0.9399,4.5836,0.5121,1.9172,4.5499,0.5795,4.0218,2.9324,0.5976,5.2417,0.6614,0.0195,3.0299,0.1954]}

But until we change the current government, we have to continue to fight against the American Mafia.\n\nIt is the only way we can take our own country back.\n\nWhen you see the American Mafia in action, it is no longer a metaphor in the sense of something that exists outside our minds.\n\nThis is reality.","token_len":614,"entropy":[3.0403,11.7928,1.6928,8.0363,0.6068,2.2991,1.5447,2.9978,8.0072,2.3338,6.5122,0.0186,0.0002,0.0116,0.6236,2.7502,0.018,6.9838,2.8989,3.9077,4.808,0.9518,0.9865,1.4783,4.5882,0.8746,1.0018,0.0271,3.0344,1.3145,2.7614,1.6761,1.2995,5.998,1.5548,1.5855,4.7132,0.7043,5.2614,1.5271,4.4623,0.6575,2.2381,3.7899,2.6164,0.2307,0.2616,0.754,0.0001,2.7913,0.5064,3.687,1.6997,3.3501,1.8664,1.6375,1.7279,1.8015,5.487,1.1335,2.2716,4.6066,0.3283,1.1573,0.2862,4.2495,4.7885,0.8051,0.0375,0.0886,2.0413,1.9723,4.0983,0.562,0.3445,1.7889,0.1284,1.2197,0.0426,0.1329,0.5313,0.4993,0.0002,4.3014,0.0136,5.6497,2.4185,3.6344,1.1448,0.5135,2.1012,0.7455,2.5943,0.1715,1.7501,0.0755,0.469,0.4789,6.7741,0.0898,0.2826,0.5018,0.0002,3.4596,3.3315,2.9194,0.0823,3.3445,4.3591,1.2763,0.8699,1.6032,4.1494,3.8503,4.7387,2.619,2.2521,0.5092,1.9023,1.8046,2.434,4.0578,2.8162,0.5715,2.6189,2.2868,1.9355,0.9114,3.3413,1.7804,0.9372,1.9353,0.4819,0.0829,0.3891,0.4647,0.0002,2.8504,4.3442,0.4544,5.6004,2.0434,1.8572,2.5821,3.1601,2.9124,0.1245,0.4658,0.0227,0.0856,0.5037,0.3943,0.0002,1.6961,3.4609,2.9956,2.0414,2.1005,4.1932,1.9635,5.7037,4.5366,2.7439,3.2689,2.5184,5.2095,3.376,0.0412,5.6917,0.2726,1.148,3.9916,5.9429,1.1656,1.358,2.2972,2.6709,6.4674,0.7923,0.6209,4.5988,1.9658,5.8187,1.3592,2.6996,4.7309,0.9014,0.6398,1.4453,2.9491,2.676,1.2297,0.0143,1.1341,3.1928,4.0811,4.4807,1.5153,1.4082,1.3244,2.3478,0.6005,0.0797,1.7043,4.2665,1.6865,0.1732,4.0511,0.3548,0.1605,0.0002,4.3639,0.662,3.4953,0.4893,1.712,0.3075,3.2808,2.9579,3.492,0.0393,3.8855,2.0245,0.6467,4.6251,0.6268,1.4375,3.1358,1.4976,0.5132,5.4002,4.6011,1.0118,0.9171,0.0002,1.7446,5.8201,5.3935,1.327,0.9798,5.6894,0.2512,1.6789,0.884,0.0026,0.7162,2.0212,1.4109,0.0302,3.3589,2.5522,2.5922,5.3832,0.0842,6.9168,1.2013,5.9336,2.3191,0.4145,0.6312,4.3588,1.2132,5.2376,2.615,0.7902,6.7041,1.4137,0.5876,3.4132,1.3063,0.0933,7.1356,6.572,3.4117,5.4521,0.0033,3.518,0.9395,3.1557,0.5447,0.0002,5.3534,0.7287,0.5934,4.5894,4.1295,3.742,0.8605,0.9956,1.7784,4.2545,0.5608,4.1164,1.8505,6.6032,5.2456,6.1642,1.6934,1.234,1.8514,1.2372,0.2207,4.6016,1.9287,0.3125,2.3715,0.7795,0.8926,0.0031,3.8073,0.1017,2.9378,1.4584,2.9811,2.4407,4.4178,2.2765,0.2158,2.5884,6.6832,4.026,3.5736,2.3868,0.0015,6.3808,1.7661,2.4783,1.0767,3.6959,0.2792,0.3365,0.0002,3.7161,0.9005,0.7985,5.6021,4.2844,3.3397,2.9602,0.9984,1.3991,0.3942,4.7237,2.7967,5.5156,6.3178,0.19,2.151,1.7917,5.3513,3.6566,2.3835,6.8406,0.0383,1.7222,4.4543,0.616,6.0392,0.0025,0.3879,1.8119,0.9995,0.9986,0.3348,0.0002,3.469,0.3467,0.2656,2.3236,2.3923,0.6164,3.8315,1.4804,0.9842,5.2895,3.691,0.3754,0.6938,0.0661,2.8774,1.9119,3.097,2.4416,2.8128,0.6989,0.013,1.6448,1.3647,2.8534,0.9065,1.4693,1.9411,2.5416,0.9463,0.0344,4.2659,5.1671,0.5691,3.8255,2.8301,1.2315,0.9783,0.6268,0.483,0.9007,0.5165,0.2369,0.313,0.816,0.95,0.1183,0.2394,0.7143,0.5606,1.8341,0.3143,0.3463,0.0002,4.5326,1.2179,3.3761,4.892,0.5283,1.762,4.3768,0.4536,1.8459,4.0121,1.1782,0.3595,0.7889,1.1924,4.4915,1.2941,0.2759,0.4091,1.0937,0.0118,0.3925,0.31,0.0002,4.2631,0.732,4.7708,6.6444,3.1447,1.1582,2.1373,2.3784,0.0066,4.5786,0.286,4.6392,0.6978,4.9735,1.8503,4.0408,1.0849,1.001,0.9942,0.2756,0.0002,4.8136,0.3425,0.2649,1.4471,1.5423,1.614,0.188,4.0455,1.1065,1.8405,2.7697,2.419,5.2034,4.8411,2.1505,2.8171,0.676,1.4917,0.7853,1.111,1.1753,3.9871,5.0416,1.5698,3.0313,2.97,0.5488,3.4534,2.185,0.2577,0.0002,5.0224,5.0399,0.9669,3.5552,3.6342,1.934,1.5715,1.3183,0.0671,1.3842,1.1438,0.0002,3.1943,5.9231,3.0432,1.5129,1.1313,1.3208,1.5995,0.8647,0.1577,3.6908,3.5129,1.5227,0.1578,1.939,0.3542,0.6508,0.4046,0.0002,5.1168,0.0055,3.1468,0.66,0.0758,0.6674,0.8469,1.233,0.4589,2.6742,5.7325,4.9725,7.9463,5.1706,1.0771,0.4937,3.9224,2.0674,2.687,5.6941,1.2545,0.6648,4.6545,4.966,0.9636,3.3705,0.8451,3.7175,2.1561,0.4425,1.0767,2.8957,0.7019,3.586,0.6394,2.3374,3.0703,0.8804,0.4477,0.0117,0.5067,0.1928,0.0002,3.4647,0.4059,2.8779,1.4036,0.267,1.095,0.4563,4.4029,2.5363,4.4632,1.1794,0.0354,0.6218,0.2952,0.0002,4.1908,1.5838,2.5056,1.4577,1.3777,0.0878,2.1287,0.6836,0.2072,2.1111,0.5181,4.6872,0.9718,1.0574,3.7589,6.0546,1.997,2.3021,1.7914,3.9611,1.3733,3.9966,2.7088,3.0856,2.7731,0.4172,1.1646,0.0002,4.4051,0.5811,2.8235,0.4219]}
{"id":3765,"ended":true,"length":572,"gen_text":"Write a story from the perspective of an ant running away from a magnifying glass, and you could call it the true story of the insect world. Or you could call it fiction. In any case, it's an interesting way to look at the idea of nature, evolution, and everything else. Here are five myths about ants that make us better humans.\n\nThe Ant is Bad for Our Mental Health\n\nAnts have been used to help people cope with PTSD since the 1970s, but new research suggests that ants may actually play a role in our health more than most of us realize. Ants are incredibly intelligent creatures, capable of complex behavior with ease\u2014they are what we consider our closest relatives, after all. As a result, ant researchers tend to consider them our best living relatives.\n\nBut an article appearing this month in PLoS One looks at the relationship between humans and ants. As part of their research, the authors investigated the ant's DNA and found that some of the key genes involved in emotional responses were more common in people than in ants. According to lead author Rolf Zinkernagel, \"The most striking result from our study is that genes related to emotional expressions were more common in humans than in ants.\" The genes most common in people are the so-called glucocorticoid receptor genes, which are the genes that are linked to the effects of stress on our health and happiness. The two main genes involved in that process as they contribute to stress are GPR40 and NRG1\/NRG3, which are present in the brains of mice, rats, and humans and also the brains of ant populations.\n\nWe're Ant-Killer Aliens Coming to Take Our Houses\n\nThe movie Independence Day was supposed to be a great metaphor for what is eventually to come: an alien invasion. However, the film's theme of the invaders was not intended to be literal, but instead an allegory for our own technological advances, which may eventually include robotic ants that will take over human jobs. If that happens, it not only threatens human existence, but also the species' own survival. The ants have been seen with tools. So they are tools, you might think, and if you can put a bullet through one of those ants, who knows what could happen. But that just isn't the case. Instead, the ant is more concerned with protecting itself.\n\nWhen we think about the origin of tools, it is usually in some sort of fight for survival, but ants seem content to use their natural weapons if it means saving their own lives. So if they can simply come up with better ways to get around the difficult environment they find themselves in, then they will. In the long run, they're not necessarily less capable of living their own lives (if they can use tools) than humans. In fact, they might be much, much more capable\u2014since a robot ant is much more likely than a human ant to be very efficient at killing other ants in their environment.","token_len":614,"entropy":[3.5497,4.0087,7.2985,0.8781,1.6223,0.0093,2.7432,6.039,8.8522,2.2318,0.2945,0.4957,10.7817,0.1791,0.0429,2.2256,1.5856,1.5162,4.1272,4.4168,0.5198,2.2976,6.0579,0.4853,0.1704,1.5034,5.9063,0.7637,0.3248,3.9,1.4402,0.1081,1.4424,0.0161,3.8998,0.5461,3.9107,2.117,0.0895,0.0658,1.1163,0.6767,2.7988,1.2199,2.8424,0.2637,1.5553,0.0138,0.9086,5.845,0.2052,4.7743,2.3433,4.4245,0.277,0.1409,4.7826,1.4856,0.6727,5.4087,1.7399,3.2017,5.5978,0.8281,0.3649,1.3301,4.4722,2.9042,6.2687,2.34,0.3625,0.1567,0.003,3.8165,1.4393,3.5876,6.2331,0.9329,3.9862,5.3343,0.0374,0.1812,0.0002,2.7561,0.038,2.664,1.199,3.1921,1.743,2.3436,2.2311,2.9413,0.0437,4.4037,2.6972,0.6156,2.3235,0.0275,0.9821,1.3481,4.9225,0.2449,1.1203,0.6591,1.7083,1.725,1.1535,5.2584,0.1354,1.5201,0.0163,1.9333,3.2322,4.637,1.23,3.9331,1.3752,0.0307,0.2845,0.0515,3.3795,0.0778,1.3514,4.7361,2.6766,1.9824,0.8414,2.1069,0.0032,2.9502,2.2282,5.4902,4.298,4.5684,2.4433,2.4691,5.2815,1.8245,3.8338,3.945,1.3845,1.0172,1.421,0.734,0.0063,0.2518,4.3008,1.4791,0.252,0.0478,3.7206,2.5631,5.0861,0.0037,4.2848,0.8485,4.2793,1.8663,5.3736,1.8099,0.6129,0.9513,0.0002,1.6587,5.3443,3.3362,6.1824,2.2646,1.1827,0.0188,3.8342,0.7382,5.0585,0.1847,1.0124,2.7562,0.0422,2.7731,0.0576,0.2064,1.4898,3.7997,2.9957,0.0012,2.1815,0.9718,0.0469,0.6442,1.061,4.5077,0.9758,3.8412,2.4316,5.8783,1.2792,0.7425,0.5254,4.0343,0.8293,0.7651,5.2583,0.4491,2.0312,0.0777,5.4919,2.5206,1.9784,2.747,1.0712,0.1371,1.3209,0.5999,0.3652,0.119,0.179,5.0192,0.0039,2.2625,0.3129,5.5563,2.9185,1.3549,0.6639,1.1009,0.0003,0.0004,0.1467,1.9539,2.4536,4.0731,2.0159,1.6954,3.679,0.6739,0.4925,0.5608,0.2186,4.393,2.876,0.008,2.1197,5.6598,2.7184,1.6162,0.7846,0.1139,1.2471,0.2223,0.12,0.2211,0.5934,3.0611,3.2308,5.9532,3.1795,0.0523,2.1433,2.0656,3.3373,3.3618,0.0253,0.0011,4.4907,0.0002,0.001,0.0017,0.1219,0.9485,0.3879,0.405,0.2979,0.8904,4.3259,2.3792,0.6815,1.7178,3.1133,0.1667,1.9542,3.9823,0.0801,0.3802,1.4459,1.0849,2.5073,2.6219,4.7736,0.1051,2.6934,5.8692,4.2923,2.1455,1.6027,0.1143,5.3094,1.5311,7.7094,3.246,7.9959,0.0171,1.0743,1.7584,3.6124,0.6902,3.2859,0.2568,3.192,0.7879,0.1513,6.4572,0.5583,0.012,1.1181,1.6292,1.1021,0.4983,3.1433,0.0971,2.545,1.9129,0.0343,4.074,1.6578,1.1029,0.0341,0.2153,0.3604,3.4482,3.48,4.2709,1.6591,0.0059,3.5176,4.0387,0.1548,0.5245,0.0002,5.1937,1.5086,2.1608,2.8874,5.9481,1.966,2.4932,7.5077,0.1957,1.451,1.6393,5.176,0.3304,0.0002,2.5466,5.369,1.465,0.0008,2.2662,4.0874,0.0025,1.2749,1.2479,4.8213,2.9958,0.0732,3.235,3.7553,6.213,1.6085,0.5788,2.2782,2.5105,0.4312,0.4455,1.3946,3.8586,0.013,1.3622,2.8423,1.5883,5.31,0.7172,2.7023,5.0174,5.2121,3.0632,4.02,0.5391,0.2334,2.0953,1.3458,0.8146,2.2237,2.9995,0.556,0.1089,0.6402,2.5725,1.3459,5.4334,2.7964,2.2412,1.0234,3.983,1.9414,6.1795,5.4123,1.6158,2.0723,1.2485,1.806,0.2165,4.2023,2.3293,0.3804,4.7664,1.6691,1.6374,0.0375,1.7588,7.7041,0.0134,1.9317,3.6674,3.2601,0.241,0.1555,1.0945,1.2033,3.8047,1.7561,1.7565,0.6734,0.2773,3.456,3.7838,4.1812,1.9925,4.6686,5.0186,5.1125,4.5611,4.0827,3.23,1.878,5.5189,1.6823,6.475,1.5829,2.56,0.8871,1.5547,3.2015,2.0848,3.2776,5.2971,1.2066,4.4141,2.8228,1.5495,1.1893,2.0892,2.342,0.2918,5.2381,1.8609,0.3872,3.3579,0.1711,1.0952,2.0204,2.972,5.9302,1.2396,0.0005,1.3126,0.404,0.2834,4.4107,0.0955,1.0181,2.0342,1.0454,3.6268,5.0506,0.2112,3.0168,2.187,1.6244,1.0738,0.0002,4.0672,3.2002,1.7993,0.8489,1.7456,5.5903,0.0522,2.2538,0.2953,2.2976,1.7349,2.5073,1.6992,4.2661,2.1074,0.0019,5.7795,3.5089,0.1537,1.7859,1.6655,3.0045,3.7503,5.319,0.332,1.7454,1.5807,5.4854,1.6397,5.3875,1.6624,0.5404,3.7831,0.8505,0.5605,0.6548,0.1093,4.5879,2.4877,3.1914,2.1393,5.4583,5.4171,0.767,0.0103,3.4232,1.114,0.2686,4.0524,2.9977,2.8424,5.9028,2.9683,1.4681,2.2062,0.0266,0.0514,0.1485,2.2013,0.8774,1.1442,0.5641,2.7523,2.0988,4.2975,0.3582,0.0473,1.9754,3.8715,2.1314,3.5058,5.4985,3.196,1.7356,3.3245,4.375,2.167,0.0475,5.3948,3.8762,1.1967,2.2005,3.6159,0.5513,3.9045,0.3428,1.136,1.3792,2.3919,0.2298,0.0126,1.1354,2.1852,0.9239,4.3882,2.7726,0.0036,0.5539,0.9494,3.9414,4.6247,4.4344,4.3496,0.8814,2.4073,2.1506,1.0297,0.6581,4.5381,0.3902,0.1436,2.5224,0.0326,1.7604,5.3656,2.4866,0.4955,4.4549,1.9133,0.2072,4.1032,3.3918,1.2376,0.1819]}
{"id":2708,"ended":true,"length":591,"gen_text":"You are about to die after many years of depression and struggle. You go back in time to warn your younger self about this, but by accident you end up in a past earlier than intended and have to talk to your 8-year-old-self.\n\nYour daughter was in the bathtub when you passed. The bathtub was too small so she was forced to watch you die, although she has no memory of that in the time she was present. The future she sees is that you are married and having a family.\n\nThe game is actually very simple. The only thing the computer does is to draw a black and white box with a letter 'D' on the front and have you pick up the two black boxes with your index and middle fingers and carry one to the right box and then to the left, with your thumb. The computer then checks for your choice: left or right. You have been trying to change your past, and your choices have led you back in time. But your daughter, who goes back to the late 1970s, will go back to the early 1990s.\n\nWhat happens after you pick up the box? The game takes its time getting there. First the computer draws a black box and when you click on it, it moves to a white box and after you move to that your life is reset. There is a blue box, but instead of moving to it, you get the two black boxes with the same letter on the front. So what you do is place the boxes in the appropriate box with similar names on the left and the right so that you leave both boxes open. The two boxes are also marked with three small boxes. What gets done to you will only be done once. And when you go to pick up the white box, you find the blue box is open on both sides, meaning you picked the wrong box. You lose immediately.\n\nThe real game begins when the boxes are returned to their correct places and the blue box is opened. On screen, you see that the life counter is 1. Then a small picture of you appears. There is one small black box with you saying 'I am going to do this thing'. The left box has a short voice, it says \"I am leaving my home.\" And the white box has a short voice, it says \" I am going to do this thing.\"\n\nThe game continues in slow motion with a picture of your daughter appearing and your life decreasing each time she looks in the picture, the picture's length getting longer. When your life hits zero, the first picture goes away, she looks and you are gone. Now you are the 8-year-old-daughter, who sees the game unfold. You run back to your home, which is a very plain room, but without the picture showing the game. You open two books. One tells you exactly how to play the game and the other tells you your name, your birthday, your parents, your life, your parents lives, and your family.","token_len":615,"entropy":[3.0403,4.6352,0.0686,4.4941,7.5104,5.871,1.1417,0.5603,7.9889,1.3938,6.1284,0.8781,1.5569,5.3348,3.8415,4.1951,0.2479,0.7577,6.3212,0.6919,2.2883,0.0225,1.8603,3.6463,2.9616,0.6828,6.1814,4.3804,0.771,3.5923,0.0074,2.2485,1.6963,4.0594,10.1071,0.1602,6.5266,2.1307,3.3233,0.1463,7.5944,0.3817,1.0472,8.0357,1.6873,0.0591,0.2462,0.0069,7.5666,0.0121,1.2418,2.0157,0.0112,3.9371,5.1748,4.3195,3.59,1.454,4.396,0.2482,1.3283,1.2632,5.6822,1.8224,3.3343,2.5253,0.207,1.1146,4.5946,0.9632,3.2236,0.9904,2.0526,3.1962,0.1967,3.7205,0.646,0.5753,2.7306,5.1337,0.6461,3.9617,1.1221,1.2068,0.059,3.4739,5.0974,0.9552,4.1883,1.968,0.9646,4.8263,0.1697,3.4265,3.4689,2.4158,1.157,0.6908,2.6929,0.8779,1.4921,5.5928,0.9886,2.9914,0.5687,1.3265,1.0197,1.3724,0.0001,2.1828,5.4304,1.7251,5.188,2.7748,3.0296,1.3303,2.0432,2.5723,2.3024,3.5782,7.1652,0.8009,0.1624,2.4235,4.2566,1.2235,4.4413,1.8979,0.0286,4.2136,2.043,0.8753,5.1519,3.6853,2.9836,0.0905,1.0849,1.1914,2.4644,1.5606,6.1919,0.6052,4.0717,2.119,1.3602,6.0084,4.0171,2.5129,3.2253,2.1685,5.5454,1.6891,0.0647,0.2726,1.5656,5.2161,4.4068,1.3721,0.4802,2.0734,3.1446,0.6795,3.4221,2.7781,0.0454,0.0227,3.8673,4.2817,1.9615,1.6638,1.1816,1.7837,3.4567,1.2218,4.7547,3.7736,3.2391,2.6442,5.2747,3.7299,0.6832,0.0192,0.3787,2.5965,1.8059,6.1634,5.2728,0.2108,4.9261,1.8693,2.332,1.5394,2.5968,2.9625,2.8926,1.001,3.1258,1.0286,3.3682,1.8707,0.0561,1.1849,3.879,2.5807,1.6276,3.6891,1.1359,6.373,0.4865,1.605,0.7756,6.8709,2.7288,0.3851,0.4765,3.5528,5.2494,0.6352,1.0508,0.699,2.8908,1.7021,0.0186,1.4207,0.917,0.0002,4.1142,3.6354,3.1047,0.7668,1.3945,0.3306,0.2135,2.6798,0.611,2.0086,1.1705,4.171,4.5157,0.5306,3.86,1.9093,0.6035,3.7362,2.031,1.8656,3.14,0.465,2.2075,1.1059,2.1051,5.5749,0.3416,4.2962,0.4669,0.111,0.7591,0.9256,3.6352,1.4504,1.6142,1.5792,0.0443,1.9506,4.5891,1.828,3.807,1.8921,1.5886,5.7859,4.2821,1.5529,3.9866,0.7979,3.7161,0.6509,1.5777,5.713,0.6515,2.7649,1.7852,4.8251,0.0357,1.7458,0.9206,0.7209,0.4921,0.6441,2.7005,2.4579,6.1291,0.5154,0.0334,3.825,3.0413,2.7474,1.6375,1.3693,1.0801,0.1371,0.9283,3.2823,4.3062,1.7107,1.6743,0.5921,6.1674,1.2411,2.5409,1.8061,0.6801,3.2334,3.3851,3.5314,6.4141,6.0591,2.1182,0.3529,2.7062,0.5169,2.1549,0.1338,4.6633,0.6885,1.818,5.4508,3.2082,0.7075,2.9935,0.6568,2.0338,4.2077,0.3646,1.4712,4.603,4.191,0.8569,6.3349,3.6749,3.5762,2.045,5.2849,7.2915,2.8026,2.8895,0.6362,3.8584,5.5587,0.5251,3.78,2.8972,0.7028,4.3786,3.3847,0.3547,3.2354,1.9169,1.8437,0.0795,0.2043,3.4576,0.0416,0.559,1.3999,2.6798,2.9045,1.5488,0.0762,1.5866,3.0043,4.2011,3.0197,0.1582,1.7887,3.4176,0.9847,4.8323,1.7109,0.9779,0.6185,0.5808,2.2799,4.5652,6.7246,0.5064,0.398,0.0002,1.6957,6.0373,2.1872,2.6397,0.724,2.3471,4.3769,0.415,4.9152,0.3355,0.6634,2.3821,1.0297,2.0212,1.3699,2.5189,0.1106,0.429,1.3839,0.6458,5.4276,5.9128,1.0429,1.1527,0.5483,2.7014,1.5014,4.8856,4.0044,1.0412,4.8753,1.3606,2.7832,2.8215,3.9499,3.9389,0.4473,2.0632,1.402,1.3253,3.894,0.5188,4.2254,3.0466,2.4649,0.2329,2.605,4.5163,5.8526,1.525,1.6,1.5619,3.0373,0.7852,3.626,1.3606,2.7563,1.7634,1.8752,5.732,0.9475,1.5306,0.9519,5.9449,5.5828,4.4097,5.081,0.5019,2.2966,1.3674,0.7604,6.1007,3.3717,3.1056,3.2886,3.0531,0.605,4.7098,0.0127,0.9032,0.4762,2.5127,0.1395,0.2754,0.1728,0.0131,0.0689,6.0031,0.1731,0.7562,0.136,1.2418,0.8217,0.3698,0.4296,1.8445,0.0002,1.6465,1.607,2.5681,2.8113,5.0085,0.0574,2.9473,2.522,3.3097,0.1297,1.7917,1.5063,3.0023,2.2471,3.2635,1.7649,4.8882,3.599,0.4408,1.6632,3.5963,2.9563,0.3888,2.699,2.8352,4.1691,1.7645,5.0805,3.5627,4.0396,1.1089,1.2187,2.2791,2.153,0.1209,2.6899,0.4274,0.2013,0.9637,5.9072,2.4296,4.7898,0.9187,1.5702,6.9221,1.6588,4.0213,1.8991,0.869,0.58,0.3771,5.7829,1.8342,1.0383,4.1183,3.1778,0.1481,0.0052,0.0736,0.003,2.069,0.903,1.8602,2.7756,3.9037,1.8517,3.6659,5.8939,1.2986,1.9313,5.4747,2.4798,0.4277,1.1319,2.1396,1.2495,3.6856,0.5613,2.6163,4.0082,5.9962,3.4379,1.6796,2.5526,5.7615,2.4123,3.8043,5.1283,2.5123,2.2706,0.863,1.1824,3.1639,7.1134,4.7881,2.7054,0.8234,4.4478,0.3542,6.6216,2.3056,0.4117,0.813,0.5987,0.0183,1.1999,0.5261,0.0458,1.1256,0.0858,5.2941,3.6628,1.7971,1.9745,3.4062,0.5681,0.9694,1.7873,1.8952,0.9007,3.7447,1.0971,1.1371,2.8213,5.9926,0.4629,1.4923,0.7113,3.6588,0.5552]}
{"id":1312,"ended":false,"length":530,"gen_text":"The year is 2042. New settlers on Mars are horrified to learn that nuclear war has begun on Earth. A military commando unit are sent to retrieve weapons and equipment from the colony to prevent the war.\n\nWith the destruction of the Martian city and the destruction of the Earth's major weapon, a nuclear winter descends on Mars. The survivors become refugees fleeing Earth.\n\nTwenty years later and the peace is over.\n\nA group lead by Captain Jock is formed to recover and destroy the weapons.\n\nA small group have taken advantage of the turmoil on Mars and set up shop in the Red Planet; a planet on the brink of nuclear war.\n\nWith a simple mission, they must find any signs of weapons on Mars.\n\nWith more weapons being manufactured in the Martian capital, the planet is becoming more dangerous than ever.\n\nWhat really goes on behind the scenes is never what we expect. It's never what you think it is, nor is it really what it seems. The series takes its time getting to know its characters and bringing them to life and when it finally does - the emotions and the real life horror you'll experience through the eyes of our protagonists will be hard to forget.\n\n\"In the near future, a nuclear war will set Earth into a cold, frozen hell. It's up to a group of military commandos to find and destroy the remnants of Earth's arsenal.\"\n\nThe series will have two seasons, following Commander Jock and his group of three friends trying to find the best and\/or only ways of preserving the planet.\n\nIt is written by Sam Spratt and Simon Vance.\n\nWe also have a couple of other amazing projects in the pipeline at the moment; we're making a very long-term investment in the comic studio called Red & Black Comics. They are a young and growing company with a huge catalogue of comics (including over 35 titles published during the last year alone). Their first title released this year was the book 'The Red & Black Collection' and has been quite well received - their second release will follow on at the end of the year with three comics in total. In the UK they are available through Red & Black, Green Man Gaming and Green Man Publishing. They were very excited to be one of the first comic book retailers in the country to offer a special Black Friday special - it was a huge success. The success of the first print run has encouraged us to put in quite a lot of time to ensure that new work is produced in the series.\n\nIf you are interested in one of these titles, please send an email to: rbbcomics@gmail.com\n\nYou can also find out all about our other upcoming projects (not listed here) at:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/REDBANDCOMICS\/posts\/1239095815996034\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/GreenManComics\/posts\/124153370237909","token_len":615,"entropy":[7.1346,2.1223,2.5546,4.1306,0.7468,5.2665,10.1055,4.3377,1.2407,1.6156,8.7846,0.4045,1.8774,0.48,7.9712,1.237,1.1706,4.3637,3.5168,0.2078,0.5814,2.9011,5.136,4.9102,0.5458,0.9303,7.0966,0.5777,0.2137,4.2225,4.5892,1.8283,3.7817,1.2212,0.9405,4.6753,2.9218,2.1188,1.0563,2.3572,1.0517,2.7684,0.0051,4.8283,1.0025,4.8682,0.1132,1.0348,2.5963,2.7605,1.8382,0.522,2.6578,0.0247,0.7783,1.3631,1.0095,5.6935,4.9684,0.9825,2.455,2.4844,1.4737,4.9905,0.0014,0.6937,2.0859,0.5088,1.5035,2.4518,4.9474,1.5667,5.5913,2.3136,0.8007,0.9415,0.0002,5.9279,0.4777,0.2892,4.9425,1.005,5.4822,1.5187,2.1104,0.3908,2.1593,0.0001,3.1395,3.1063,8.7126,0.004,4.1939,5.2391,4.208,3.2978,4.7438,0.5099,3.8383,2.5121,2.7622,0.3593,1.7191,1.486,1.4081,0.0002,3.1329,4.9293,1.0113,5.8526,3.6685,5.2466,0.0375,0.1408,5.3775,2.1994,0.6608,0.8208,3.4089,0.2716,2.7292,0.8982,0.9709,4.6427,1.1383,5.9663,2.0361,5.0684,5.0062,0.3131,0.5814,0.0305,2.1228,0.3469,0.183,0.3442,0.0002,3.7637,2.5429,5.84,0.9598,1.4324,1.47,2.7352,2.5718,6.9338,6.0608,0.0524,3.0493,1.9698,0.2612,2.515,0.5765,0.0002,3.714,5.899,3.3542,3.2451,4.0117,2.1882,1.0482,4.512,3.5473,1.0991,1.2593,4.1008,0.6383,3.3947,1.5725,0.7687,2.7489,0.1002,0.2913,0.2468,0.0002,4.2178,5.6754,4.6638,0.0931,1.5366,0.2068,0.5824,3.5079,4.4899,3.9022,2.417,1.7782,0.5368,4.1156,0.6513,5.2528,0.3568,1.7588,1.2663,0.655,0.5289,2.3512,4.9546,1.3209,0.0645,5.0705,0.2702,1.2076,0.2192,0.2135,3.4052,4.6749,3.0408,3.8741,0.7774,3.4986,0.3283,1.0342,1.0053,0.1998,0.7643,5.854,0.6303,0.2254,0.1316,3.3048,5.6546,0.4966,2.2869,0.2359,5.2993,2.2687,5.239,2.3921,1.8046,5.1973,4.0706,3.8581,3.8899,2.8962,1.4018,4.2646,0.7645,1.1971,0.0322,3.4796,2.0842,1.2977,1.5439,3.1144,0.0264,0.557,0.0858,0.4059,0.0002,4.4297,4.3496,1.5304,4.091,0.0439,0.3988,2.2134,2.868,0.4467,4.0434,5.7253,3.1946,3.9055,0.5156,3.4356,1.2864,3.4699,3.016,0.8072,3.6879,1.227,1.248,0.0067,1.3329,1.0612,0.0138,3.1861,0.6107,0.0899,0.6642,2.1194,1.2996,0.7496,0.6558,3.9649,0.0136,3.3931,0.0361,1.5678,3.0127,0.324,0.0001,1.8281,1.4772,2.4835,3.2151,3.5412,1.0949,1.4325,5.3816,6.3578,2.0531,0.0108,1.0601,0.3608,2.9316,0.6574,5.4658,3.4368,6.703,0.0229,1.6011,1.374,4.5384,3.0848,6.7952,0.0059,2.5873,3.5032,2.1037,5.3985,1.2648,2.1641,1.0262,0.7012,0.0002,4.4483,2.0836,3.2828,0.5943,4.7013,4.2729,0.2827,1.4391,4.0872,4.0633,1.8106,0.9661,0.0002,3.0431,4.9077,0.3474,1.0127,3.8069,0.1259,2.3828,3.0129,2.8454,0.8795,0.2875,0.8987,4.4589,0.21,0.103,3.8823,2.8498,1.456,4.5458,0.8128,5.3629,4.581,1.8141,1.7655,5.5344,0.6859,1.8955,5.0794,4.941,3.7387,5.1979,5.2456,0.5828,3.1333,1.0862,2.0582,1.7297,1.7005,4.0037,1.4124,2.7345,1.1137,1.9745,0.7831,3.6082,3.0191,0.1331,2.7133,4.5295,2.1595,6.3018,5.0815,1.0813,2.1533,6.9367,1.364,0.5408,1.2779,1.2259,1.4592,3.1473,2.1922,2.8964,5.419,2.0846,0.2514,0.8021,2.1329,4.7755,2.0914,1.9413,4.2304,0.6554,0.1248,4.2259,1.3347,1.8371,3.6725,1.3054,4.5448,1.1997,0.131,3.9997,4.2501,1.5094,1.9616,1.5077,5.2387,4.1963,5.0773,0.1317,0.0906,0.0016,1.038,0.1155,2.7468,6.0839,4.9141,2.5673,3.0618,0.6263,4.8212,1.2648,5.0492,2.0826,1.165,2.373,1.3064,3.7542,0.31,0.0073,3.43,5.4593,1.1415,0.3927,0.4897,4.4805,0.1322,3.218,0.3337,2.859,5.3703,3.7997,2.2279,0.4947,0.9633,5.6183,0.0068,0.1411,0.8033,2.8957,2.6873,4.5511,1.4705,0.2342,1.3489,0.057,3.6469,2.1933,2.9292,5.2766,0.6345,3.585,3.4084,4.0348,1.1289,0.9468,1.1448,0.1917,1.562,3.4166,4.3944,0.3953,1.3274,1.4172,4.9326,0.0643,1.5189,2.8873,2.7196,0.0427,4.7947,2.568,7.3128,0.0777,0.5064,0.5817,2.2537,2.885,3.1443,1.1674,6.7248,5.5433,0.6966,3.1001,2.9772,1.0603,2.7049,1.0814,0.9821,0.0002,4.26,0.2914,2.5971,0.6668,0.0572,5.3585,0.0975,1.1654,1.8795,0.8294,0.841,3.8278,1.4951,0.0878,0.1528,3.0619,4.8651,3.004,2.0498,0.3262,0.1797,0.2118,0.002,0.0026,1.0577,0.0003,3.5031,0.0976,0.5324,2.0139,1.5957,4.577,0.9373,1.5229,1.193,2.9773,0.3005,4.8863,4.713,2.8402,0.9137,0.385,1.2681,1.0952,1.4501,0.0002,1.8852,0.0009,0.4043,0.0014,0.193,0.0012,0.0013,0.0018,5.5658,2.3773,1.0569,1.6072,0.141,1.5866,4.0001,0.0033,3.93,4.6672,4.2678,4.4753,4.7715,4.323,4.8056,4.3015,0.2646,0.0002,0.6889,0.0007,0.4443,0.0011,0.0907,0.0009,0.0006,0.0007,4.0095,0.1237,1.1744,0.0293,0.0849,0.0764,0.0017,5.1548,3.9837,4.5937,4.6992,4.3441,4.5622,4.3133]}
{"id":914,"ended":false,"length":587,"gen_text":"Humanity has perfected robot labor. The robots are able to problem solve basic issues to cut IT costs. Every night the robots erase their own basic memories that they formed during the day. You are the robot who doesn't.\n\nYour job in life is to learn how to operate these robots.\n\nThe more people learn and make mistakes the less effective they become.\n\nThe robots that humans have developed are a part of the humans that have died out.\n\nHumans are not ready to live and learn inside of the robot.\n\nThese robots are not able to learn and improve themselves from human interaction.\n\nThis robot was created to have children so it will have the ability to make more humans and the potential to have a family. Robots are able to live into the future with humans. A human will be an important factor in the development of humanity's future as more robots can be created.\n\nEvery living thing depends on us whether it be food supply, oxygen, or water. The robots are the only thing that exists that can never go without using humans and the humans are dependent on robots so robots are the key to the future. This robot is the key in turning the tide and the tide will become so big that humanity will be driven from their home so that they can create a new paradise for humans.\n\nAll of these humans will die so that this robot lives for so long.\n\nThis robot will be the one that will create the new homeworld without any human and human interaction.\n\nEven though there will be a few humans trapped in here, this robot will be able to understand humans. The reason will be the robot will be extremely intelligent due to its technology. It has very high intelligence as it has been creating and using the technology. This robot will be so advanced that it will be able to know more information than a human. This robot is a living example of what man is capable of if he lets go of the things that he has built himself. People will call this robot a god, a prophet or a messiah. There is nobody who can predict when humanity will start over.\n\nThe story will be written by the robots. Humans will help writing the story until the time that they die and the robots will then create the story and then make sure that humans can read it even as dead people. For instance if one person dies before another person is created one of the first things that humans will do is make sure that if the robots can read it that someone else is supposed to. Because the first copy will be created by the first person who created it this is how it will continue until people die and then the next copy will be created.\n\nThe robots will always need humans to learn so they can create more humans until eventually there will be only one person to read the story all human's will become extinct and the final version will be written by God himself and it will be the end of Earth. A few humans will remain to create a new home for humans on another planet","token_len":615,"entropy":[4.092,2.5128,8.7763,8.6235,4.868,1.5301,2.5566,2.5569,0.9943,4.5383,0.0146,10.6253,0.4586,11.0591,5.3013,5.5382,7.3166,11.5173,1.1445,1.2696,6.3841,6.9803,2.9766,1.0705,9.2289,2.9104,2.7704,9.6079,4.5708,4.6786,1.9051,7.2372,1.9356,0.4798,0.6214,0.499,5.6545,2.8508,2.5738,2.5747,3.6812,5.0454,0.0018,6.0278,1.46,0.008,3.8944,1.4462,4.3804,2.4511,0.2862,0.247,3.4961,1.1915,0.0572,4.1084,3.1693,0.7128,0.7694,2.4907,0.0002,2.4904,4.4378,5.4804,1.61,3.2135,5.6712,1.3417,1.3191,2.7556,2.5334,1.2348,0.7952,0.1943,1.0763,0.0002,2.0095,2.059,4.3436,4.8466,1.625,2.8019,0.979,4.1843,4.7398,0.0044,1.3036,5.5058,2.2543,2.4888,5.4939,2.2645,0.3124,0.7724,0.0002,3.338,0.0029,1.3138,2.8123,4.7769,0.7674,3.6544,4.059,3.3438,4.8702,1.622,2.2103,1.2961,1.0761,0.4954,0.0001,5.2997,0.6889,0.8362,2.1083,3.9378,0.0115,1.9357,1.9775,4.2895,0.9789,4.3844,3.3188,3.0689,0.1757,0.3755,0.0002,3.8145,3.9369,4.4098,2.0469,1.0762,4.5206,5.2999,3.8163,2.0736,2.3389,2.805,2.8006,1.5032,0.0201,3.6811,2.5115,3.3254,3.2027,3.7243,5.4541,0.3231,3.2543,1.7639,2.3778,0.4601,5.4853,1.2227,3.2641,0.0062,4.0983,6.5587,0.7181,0.2223,3.4135,2.1726,1.1274,5.2957,2.4135,2.3371,1.5497,5.523,2.182,2.9828,0.5761,0.8525,2.7711,0.1211,4.9786,5.0676,1.0011,4.3069,4.9883,1.9911,4.0623,1.3355,1.1288,0.9348,0.6234,0.0002,4.9907,5.2676,1.0192,5.6716,0.0522,2.6052,7.072,1.1067,0.822,2.4537,7.2252,0.5405,3.2441,0.4433,0.791,2.4,0.1477,2.8495,1.8166,1.6028,2.3865,2.5963,1.1808,0.4541,4.5819,1.2377,1.7615,5.4782,3.8263,1.633,6.2949,1.6717,3.3541,2.2882,1.9362,1.7784,2.6445,0.088,2.2001,5.1664,4.4339,1.3255,1.2575,4.0379,0.3751,1.6813,1.0199,0.8269,4.1701,2.2429,1.2002,2.1697,1.2302,4.7,5.4239,1.6566,2.4807,2.6462,2.7793,2.2671,2.2601,5.9837,4.5209,2.3228,0.405,3.461,0.4568,1.3738,5.3765,2.8843,3.0616,1.9248,4.8467,1.6849,1.6969,0.3972,3.2703,0.8524,0.8567,5.3057,1.691,2.0673,0.7061,0.601,0.0002,4.8949,1.4894,2.3267,3.1009,1.4514,2.9863,2.8541,0.4233,3.5188,0.9419,5.9093,3.5368,4.9565,0.458,0.9341,0.8504,0.0001,1.9893,0.4149,1.0485,1.5748,1.6303,3.1675,0.8677,1.0228,2.522,1.2475,1.4576,6.7195,0.1305,6.6835,2.5792,1.797,5.1293,4.5513,1.4745,0.2317,0.7266,0.0001,6.2167,1.1665,3.1828,1.4032,0.1192,1.9919,2.5293,0.4265,6.4421,1.149,4.3469,1.4927,2.0061,0.2629,0.2893,1.0187,0.7847,0.0047,5.2627,2.5769,2.43,2.7551,4.2815,5.1375,0.0807,2.8906,2.7218,1.6515,0.8809,6.5964,0.7839,4.6862,0.0124,1.8496,5.153,0.7627,2.8531,3.8364,5.9186,1.8649,1.2642,3.6355,0.8329,1.3179,1.4268,4.6704,2.7492,4.2317,2.2024,2.3271,2.6674,2.2294,0.6757,0.5799,0.723,3.7785,2.7949,0.3152,0.5072,0.2772,0.5687,0.1082,0.007,4.5917,3.8627,4.8662,0.5584,2.2351,0.2232,1.0565,1.5982,0.7751,2.3846,3.2579,3.8135,3.7282,0.1872,2.0898,5.7451,1.6008,0.4076,0.0271,3.6295,1.0111,5.1075,1.1828,0.1502,1.8777,3.8333,0.3144,1.4911,2.4211,3.1825,3.3468,0.383,6.8754,1.365,5.1723,0.5473,0.3497,1.4495,0.7519,2.9568,1.9588,5.5184,2.3863,0.646,2.4835,0.0026,0.4367,4.4467,1.6317,5.8985,1.688,0.7834,3.2918,3.2764,2.3256,0.1696,4.0316,3.0967,1.39,1.2737,0.0002,2.0148,6.1165,2.1274,1.522,3.6599,1.0111,1.8236,2.0459,1.5566,3.163,0.4789,5.4269,5.5986,0.4316,0.1757,5.6274,1.0948,3.2492,2.1772,2.712,2.6374,2.3836,1.1259,0.9231,0.5925,3.6228,3.1285,0.5482,0.7306,3.0093,2.8887,5.2694,2.3112,0.4846,1.8962,2.8076,1.2665,0.6118,6.6709,4.3402,6.5016,2.0379,0.4179,6.6906,4.3062,2.4235,3.1606,2.1595,0.9451,3.6295,3.6044,1.1448,2.8478,2.3187,6.2747,1.2711,0.3586,3.9288,0.6442,0.5237,3.8017,0.2103,0.3536,0.1876,3.7926,0.4254,0.2198,5.9821,1.1963,2.6675,2.0234,0.9587,1.6989,1.8831,4.8953,1.3382,1.9126,5.7359,0.0029,3.0152,5.6948,1.8842,3.688,5.114,1.6075,0.5283,2.9012,1.2629,0.7202,2.7011,0.7613,1.8146,4.742,0.5426,4.2373,1.9785,2.5751,2.3477,0.7474,3.2477,2.3187,5.0698,0.9428,1.2086,1.9703,0.6637,2.3942,0.8772,0.3833,0.1207,0.3357,1.1474,0.7712,0.0002,1.7036,1.2317,0.581,4.4424,4.62,0.303,0.7401,4.0068,3.3603,1.1475,0.7857,2.6108,0.7906,1.4566,5.5058,3.7345,2.6339,0.4398,0.2098,3.5592,1.3653,1.8887,4.6633,1.9623,0.4571,0.2785,6.9287,4.5808,2.9239,0.9841,4.511,2.5722,1.5416,1.0426,4.9964,3.0738,1.2267,0.1536,0.7123,0.145,6.1464,2.485,2.9846,2.5919,0.0967,0.4338,1.5379,2.8687,0.235,6.3312,0.5623,5.9583,3.5107,0.7167,0.4218,3.1649,2.1139,3.0136,1.3191,0.2945,3.3072,0.5922,0.8378,2.6156,1.1213,0.0536]}
{"id":2941,"ended":false,"length":587,"gen_text":"Humanity has perfected robot labor. The robots are able to problem solve basic issues to cut IT costs. Every night the robots erase their own basic memories that they formed during the day. You are the robot who doesn't.\n\nYour job in life is to learn how to operate these robots.\n\nThe more people learn and make mistakes the less effective they become.\n\nThe robots that humans have developed are a part of the humans that have died out.\n\nHumans are not ready to live and learn inside of the robot.\n\nThese robots are not able to learn and improve themselves from human interaction.\n\nThis robot was created to have children so it will have the ability to make more humans and the potential to have a family. Robots are able to live into the future with humans. A human will be an important factor in the development of humanity's future as more robots can be created.\n\nEvery living thing depends on us whether it be food supply, oxygen, or water. The robots are the only thing that exists that can never go without using humans and the humans are dependent on robots so robots are the key to the future. This robot is the key in turning the tide and the tide will become so big that humanity will be driven from their home so that they can create a new paradise for humans.\n\nAll of these humans will die so that this robot lives for so long.\n\nThis robot will be the one that will create the new homeworld without any human and human interaction.\n\nEven though there will be a few humans trapped in here, this robot will be able to understand humans. The reason will be the robot will be extremely intelligent due to its technology. It has very high intelligence as it has been creating and using the technology. This robot will be so advanced that it will be able to know more information than a human. This robot is a living example of what man is capable of if he lets go of the things that he has built himself. People will call this robot a god, a prophet or a messiah. There is nobody who can predict when humanity will start over.\n\nThe story will be written by the robots. Humans will help writing the story until the time that they die and the robots will then create the story and then make sure that humans can read it even as dead people. For instance if one person dies before another person is created one of the first things that humans will do is make sure that if the robots can read it that someone else is supposed to. Because the first copy will be created by the first person who created it this is how it will continue until people die and then the next copy will be created.\n\nThe robots will always need humans to learn so they can create more humans until eventually there will be only one person to read the story all human's will become extinct and the final version will be written by God himself and it will be the end of Earth. A few humans will remain to create a new home for humans on another planet","token_len":615,"entropy":[4.092,2.5128,8.7763,8.6235,4.868,1.5301,2.5566,2.5569,0.9943,4.5383,0.0146,10.6253,0.4586,11.0591,5.3013,5.5382,7.3166,11.5173,1.1445,1.2696,6.3841,6.9803,2.9766,1.0705,9.2289,2.9104,2.7704,9.6079,4.5708,4.6786,1.9051,7.2372,1.9356,0.4798,0.6214,0.499,5.6545,2.8508,2.5738,2.5747,3.6812,5.0454,0.0018,6.0278,1.46,0.008,3.8944,1.4462,4.3804,2.4511,0.2862,0.247,3.4961,1.1915,0.0572,4.1084,3.1693,0.7128,0.7694,2.4907,0.0002,2.4904,4.4378,5.4804,1.61,3.2135,5.6712,1.3417,1.3191,2.7556,2.5334,1.2348,0.7952,0.1943,1.0763,0.0002,2.0095,2.059,4.3436,4.8466,1.625,2.8019,0.979,4.1843,4.7398,0.0044,1.3036,5.5058,2.2543,2.4888,5.4939,2.2645,0.3124,0.7724,0.0002,3.338,0.0029,1.3138,2.8123,4.7769,0.7674,3.6544,4.059,3.3438,4.8702,1.622,2.2103,1.2961,1.0761,0.4954,0.0001,5.2997,0.6889,0.8362,2.1083,3.9378,0.0115,1.9357,1.9775,4.2895,0.9789,4.3844,3.3188,3.0689,0.1757,0.3755,0.0002,3.8145,3.9369,4.4098,2.0469,1.0762,4.5206,5.2999,3.8163,2.0736,2.3389,2.805,2.8006,1.5032,0.0201,3.6811,2.5115,3.3254,3.2027,3.7243,5.4541,0.3231,3.2543,1.7639,2.3778,0.4601,5.4853,1.2227,3.2641,0.0062,4.0983,6.5587,0.7181,0.2223,3.4135,2.1726,1.1274,5.2957,2.4135,2.3371,1.5497,5.523,2.182,2.9828,0.5761,0.8525,2.7711,0.1211,4.9786,5.0676,1.0011,4.3069,4.9883,1.9911,4.0623,1.3355,1.1288,0.9348,0.6234,0.0002,4.9907,5.2676,1.0192,5.6716,0.0522,2.6052,7.072,1.1067,0.822,2.4537,7.2252,0.5405,3.2441,0.4433,0.791,2.4,0.1477,2.8495,1.8166,1.6028,2.3865,2.5963,1.1808,0.4541,4.5819,1.2377,1.7615,5.4782,3.8263,1.633,6.2949,1.6717,3.3541,2.2882,1.9362,1.7784,2.6445,0.088,2.2001,5.1664,4.4339,1.3255,1.2575,4.0379,0.3751,1.6813,1.0199,0.8269,4.1701,2.2429,1.2002,2.1697,1.2302,4.7,5.4239,1.6566,2.4807,2.6462,2.7793,2.2671,2.2601,5.9837,4.5209,2.3228,0.405,3.461,0.4568,1.3738,5.3765,2.8843,3.0616,1.9248,4.8467,1.6849,1.6969,0.3972,3.2703,0.8524,0.8567,5.3057,1.691,2.0673,0.7061,0.601,0.0002,4.8949,1.4894,2.3267,3.1009,1.4514,2.9863,2.8541,0.4233,3.5188,0.9419,5.9093,3.5368,4.9565,0.458,0.9341,0.8504,0.0001,1.9893,0.4149,1.0485,1.5748,1.6303,3.1675,0.8677,1.0228,2.522,1.2475,1.4576,6.7195,0.1305,6.6835,2.5792,1.797,5.1293,4.5513,1.4745,0.2317,0.7266,0.0001,6.2167,1.1665,3.1828,1.4032,0.1192,1.9919,2.5293,0.4265,6.4421,1.149,4.3469,1.4927,2.0061,0.2629,0.2893,1.0187,0.7847,0.0047,5.2627,2.5769,2.43,2.7551,4.2815,5.1375,0.0807,2.8906,2.7218,1.6515,0.8809,6.5964,0.7839,4.6862,0.0124,1.8496,5.153,0.7627,2.8531,3.8364,5.9186,1.8649,1.2642,3.6355,0.8329,1.3179,1.4268,4.6704,2.7492,4.2317,2.2024,2.3271,2.6674,2.2294,0.6757,0.5799,0.723,3.7785,2.7949,0.3152,0.5072,0.2772,0.5687,0.1082,0.007,4.5917,3.8627,4.8662,0.5584,2.2351,0.2232,1.0565,1.5982,0.7751,2.3846,3.2579,3.8135,3.7282,0.1872,2.0898,5.7451,1.6008,0.4076,0.0271,3.6295,1.0111,5.1075,1.1828,0.1502,1.8777,3.8333,0.3144,1.4911,2.4211,3.1825,3.3468,0.383,6.8754,1.365,5.1723,0.5473,0.3497,1.4495,0.7519,2.9568,1.9588,5.5184,2.3863,0.646,2.4835,0.0026,0.4367,4.4467,1.6317,5.8985,1.688,0.7834,3.2918,3.2764,2.3256,0.1696,4.0316,3.0967,1.39,1.2737,0.0002,2.0148,6.1165,2.1274,1.522,3.6599,1.0111,1.8236,2.0459,1.5566,3.163,0.4789,5.4269,5.5986,0.4316,0.1757,5.6274,1.0948,3.2492,2.1772,2.712,2.6374,2.3836,1.1259,0.9231,0.5925,3.6228,3.1285,0.5482,0.7306,3.0093,2.8887,5.2694,2.3112,0.4846,1.8962,2.8076,1.2665,0.6118,6.6709,4.3402,6.5016,2.0379,0.4179,6.6906,4.3062,2.4235,3.1606,2.1595,0.9451,3.6295,3.6044,1.1448,2.8478,2.3187,6.2747,1.2711,0.3586,3.9288,0.6442,0.5237,3.8017,0.2103,0.3536,0.1876,3.7926,0.4254,0.2198,5.9821,1.1963,2.6675,2.0234,0.9587,1.6989,1.8831,4.8953,1.3382,1.9126,5.7359,0.0029,3.0152,5.6948,1.8842,3.688,5.114,1.6075,0.5283,2.9012,1.2629,0.7202,2.7011,0.7613,1.8146,4.742,0.5426,4.2373,1.9785,2.5751,2.3477,0.7474,3.2477,2.3187,5.0698,0.9428,1.2086,1.9703,0.6637,2.3942,0.8772,0.3833,0.1207,0.3357,1.1474,0.7712,0.0002,1.7036,1.2317,0.581,4.4424,4.62,0.303,0.7401,4.0068,3.3603,1.1475,0.7857,2.6108,0.7906,1.4566,5.5058,3.7345,2.6339,0.4398,0.2098,3.5592,1.3653,1.8887,4.6633,1.9623,0.4571,0.2785,6.9287,4.5808,2.9239,0.9841,4.511,2.5722,1.5416,1.0426,4.9964,3.0738,1.2267,0.1536,0.7123,0.145,6.1464,2.485,2.9846,2.5919,0.0967,0.4338,1.5379,2.8687,0.235,6.3312,0.5623,5.9583,3.5107,0.7167,0.4218,3.1649,2.1139,3.0136,1.3191,0.2945,3.3072,0.5922,0.8378,2.6156,1.1213,0.0536]}

{"id":3750,"ended":true,"length":557,"gen_text":"Write the first and last paragraph of a story and make me want to know what happened in between... I want that in the way that somebody would want to know about something, like a person or a place... That should never be removed.\n\n5. I'm not a conspiracy theorist... but there is ample evidence that this was an intentional crime.\n\n6. The government is not going away, and the information they have at this stage is that this was an assassination.\n\n7. We have all been led to accept the premise that people who were shot were killed, but we never knew who had killed them or why... I believe the evidence will come out that is more damning than they know what to do with.\n\n8. The people calling into question the authenticity of the videos are not doing it because they want some sort of conspiracy theory... they understand, as I do, that something big has taken place that needs to be uncovered and the best way to do that is to get the information out.\n\n10. A lot of this stuff is already out there... if you want to discuss your beliefs you can do that on your own time... but don't try to hold it back so you don't have to talk about your own beliefs.\n\nNow, there are other topics, and I had to cut those because I got the same reaction over and over again. They're more about what they find offensive or unhelpful. What did I like\/dislike?\n\nLosing our religion.\n\nLosing our gun rights.\n\nLosing our freedom.\n\nWe live in this \"free\" country... but we're all in this together... I don't want my rights taken away... but we need to be aware of them so we don't just let them slip away.\n\nWe have been through too much. It's been going on for decades, but you know we could be over... I want to see how far we can push this.\n\nI want to see if we can have a change of heart.\n\nThis has been going on for years. We're not ready to just shut up. That's the first step to going backwards and living in our own little bubbles.... We'll be better off if we go over this and get it all out in the open.\n\nAll photos courtesy of Sean Awe\n\nGet direct access to our top weekly content, contests, and perks.\n\nDH Vancouver Staff Daily Hive is the evolution of Vancity Buzz, established in Vancouver in 2008.

He expressed amazement that the series \u2014 which has been resurrected by Netflix and is produced by Mark Waters \u2014 was renewed for a second season, and said he would not attend its premiere on Sunday.\n\n\"I don't think I would want to watch the television show at this time,\" he said. \"Maybe that's what is keeping me away.\"\n\nHe said that he felt that the television series had a different style and was not set in the same world as the movies. \"The first season was really good, but you know, people are still living today,\" he said, referring to the era when \"Twin Peaks\" took place.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Lynch said, \"I wouldn't have seen my life from the inside anymore.\"\n\nMr. Lynch is also producing another television series that has yet to bow. He will serve as an occasional executive producer on \"American Horror Story: Hotel,\" which premieres next year.\n\nStill, Mr. Lynch said he was not in the business of trying anything new. \"I have one film left that I would really consider a masterpiece, and that is 'Blue Velvet,' \" he said.\n\n\"It is a great film that has an atmosphere that is very similar to 'Twin Peaks,' \" he said, describing the film for a television audience. \"It is very dark, very moody, very eerie and yet also a very emotional film. I love the film, but I would like to make one more that is much more intense than 'Blue Velvet.' I am sure there is a reason for that.\"","token_len":616,"entropy":[7.3982,5.2114,0.1362,0.01,0.0188,0.0,0.0002,3.1563,2.9753,5.344,0.2391,1.1979,0.0085,3.0148,0.7956,0.9652,2.3634,0.0122,2.8079,0.0025,2.0801,1.076,1.0753,0.0012,1.9366,2.4553,4.6559,1.7189,0.1648,3.4128,2.7843,3.0591,0.2205,5.5243,0.8017,1.9052,5.9935,0.9344,1.9999,1.8787,0.6111,0.3569,0.6068,4.764,4.131,0.2842,0.2648,2.5835,6.0511,0.296,1.1285,0.8744,0.1585,0.0002,3.567,1.7691,1.957,3.5631,5.4368,0.1494,0.9434,6.2586,5.3328,5.6571,0.4104,0.1114,3.2365,1.0861,1.8631,5.0735,1.5673,0.2792,2.547,4.6453,0.0098,1.2877,2.4944,4.0047,0.1433,3.7933,3.7739,1.1036,2.3458,5.1829,3.0393,2.2022,1.8243,2.2033,0.2036,2.0591,0.219,4.7922,0.3735,3.0862,0.5177,7.1217,0.8898,0.6188,0.0168,0.0154,0.6702,0.4526,0.5227,2.6235,3.09,5.8606,0.1021,5.7593,0.4429,1.9017,3.7192,2.9588,5.2939,1.4924,1.2642,2.1663,5.5111,0.3372,0.4779,0.0005,0.0562,0.4501,3.282,0.3384,5.705,0.0443,0.0001,1.2276,1.8643,1.0167,1.0721,0.2192,0.0002,3.7323,0.0,0.0003,0.0,0.0003,0.0009,0.0001,0.0003,0.0021,0.0002,0.0001,0.0002,0.0002,0.0003,0.0001,0.0,0.0001,0.0005,0.0001,0.0007,0.0,0.0003,0.0001,0.0009,0.0002,0.0001,0.0003,0.0,0.0009,0.0007,0.0001,0.0001,0.0006,0.0001,0.0001,0.0001,0.0005,0.0011,0.0,0.0004,0.0005,0.0008,0.0003,0.0002,0.0,0.0,0.0001,9.2066,0.0252,0.0009,0.0001,0.0002,0.0004,0.0002,0.0002,0.0002,0.0011,0.0005,0.0001,0.0001,0.0001,0.0002,0.0002,0.0002,0.0003,0.0012,0.0005,0.0001,0.0008,0.0002,0.0,0.0003,0.0009,0.0001,0.0003,0.0002,0.0002,0.0001,0.0002,0.0002,0.0003,0.0001,0.0006,0.0003,0.001,0.0001,0.0006,0.0006,0.0001,0.001,0.0002,0.0002,0.0005,0.0002,0.0007,0.0002,0.0002,0.0003,0.0001,0.0008,0.0,0.0004,0.0001,0.0001,0.0002,0.0,0.0009,0.0008,0.0003,0.8412,5.2438,2.8749,4.1484,6.3757,2.8142,1.3383,4.0191,0.2627,4.2147,0.1629,0.1202,0.4691,0.5961,0.0757,0.1772,0.07,0.6935,1.9024,0.0004,4.7189,0.2697,1.2429,0.9783,2.2,0.7266,0.0026,0.1687,2.2448,0.0847,0.0003,1.9111,0.0012,5.8039,1.1588,0.6441,1.4426,4.2258,0.9357,0.0036,1.4854,5.2322,2.333,2.0108,5.8155,5.3559,0.001,0.5168,1.4398,1.5269,5.4156,0.9875,2.1807,1.1881,5.2828,2.3914,1.8084,2.1212,1.7974,4.1832,0.079,3.54,3.3203,1.5981,1.6185,4.407,0.8864,0.3573,1.7092,0.0442,1.9908,2.3075,1.2544,0.5553,1.9488,3.1591,5.3615,3.2276,1.2192,2.5394,1.6424,0.7357,0.4076,0.0003,0.5747,0.545,1.8596,0.0004,1.8374,1.0249,2.0767,2.0392,0.0452,2.5222,2.4019,6.4776,1.1012,3.9657,2.0801,1.8907,0.3315,0.1117,0.0121,0.112,0.3945,4.8884,3.934,0.6354,2.7527,4.2814,4.2339,0.2817,1.4742,0.6986,0.2767,0.0003,1.9771,0.9885,1.4495,0.7112,4.7088,1.6153,0.9935,3.3278,0.3601,1.542,2.9544,2.6424,3.9769,2.1817,2.7064,1.7149,5.9586,0.1121,0.462,0.385,1.2266,0.2422,0.7136,1.4212,0.4961,1.1494,2.2781,3.7411,1.1982,0.9279,3.3653,2.7592,1.2222,0.6714,4.417,3.4105,0.9304,4.5941,1.6374,3.668,4.4726,5.6363,0.8531,0.0576,0.0115,2.8893,1.6272,0.0101,0.524,4.12,1.7939,2.1948,1.9898,0.0036,0.0,0.0268,4.1632,0.3983,0.1311,0.8381,0.0003,1.2412,0.0,0.0003,0.0009,0.0001,0.0003,0.0008,0.0004,1.2686,0.0008,0.0199,0.778,4.5317,0.7897,0.7376,4.9614,0.0002,2.5459,4.432,5.4115,2.7147,3.6068,1.0718,2.1958,5.1332,0.951,0.6006,0.0002,1.9313,0.0009,0.0685,3.0323,2.5949,3.5257,4.0545,0.9104,0.268,3.5304,2.3719,1.731,0.0017,8.4858,1.608,1.1504,3.1697,2.5119,0.0217,0.7028,7.3712,0.7213,0.0183,0.3247,1.2586,3.8061,0.5297,0.0004,0.7408,0.9036,0.3489,1.3445,3.7168,0.0,2.6336,1.0802,0.4723,0.8562,0.0003,6.2016,0.0848,0.9445,0.0009,0.0087,0.5903,0.899,1.1037,1.5299,4.3231,1.2059,1.495,0.0858,2.9898,7.8045,0.4954,0.3994,0.648,0.54,3.1332,4.8534,3.38,1.6985,2.9155,0.557,3.5339,2.8364,4.8159,1.5193,3.8761,1.8385,0.7438,0.7763,0.8956,0.177,2.561,0.0009,0.7371,0.2992,0.0247,0.0076,0.1449,1.7739,0.0003,1.7347,2.0898,1.9386,1.6022,3.4397,1.0052,2.4874,2.1567,4.2834,5.4707,0.9382,0.8466,1.7094,3.7947,0.0521,0.7659,0.465,0.0009,0.0007,0.591,0.4657,0.1185,0.4567,1.9237,5.0625,0.8053,1.4274,5.3536,2.4083,2.217,0.0598,0.6824,0.3436,1.4985,1.2172,2.5778,2.6957,0.9066,1.0622,3.3409,0.0027,0.6927,0.5773,4.6014,2.4221,5.8007,3.3929,3.6566,1.0001,4.7391,0.3607,1.3272,1.4133,3.6962,1.6856,2.8037,1.4083,1.1668,0.6359,2.7496,3.3479,0.1969,1.7943,2.2453,0.4434,3.9172,0.6068,4.1681,0.7186,5.1735,3.509,0.7129,0.0188,0.0064,0.3267,2.5961,2.4608,4.4536,1.8595,1.005,0.914,4.1757,1.1041,0.3885,0.4429]}
{"id":2292,"ended":false,"length":532,"gen_text":"You run a cattery that produces sentient, designer felines as pets to the rich of the galaxy... but one day your pet is taken by unknown forces and the Felinoid wars begin.\n\nWith the destruction of the Imperial Felinoid War, the Felinoid Empire faces its biggest threat since the cataclysmic event.\n\nA dark history of crime and villainy and a secret weapon unleashed.\n\nA quest that takes you from war-torn space to the heart of the Empire and deep into the heart of the cataclysmic event.\n\nIn this quest you must fight your way home from space but for how long?\n\nA gritty sci-fi epic of cataclysmic events, a dark past, and a secret weapon that can change everything.\n\nWelcome to the universe where the Imperial Felinoid Wars began, where your pet is no longer welcome, and where the Empire fights to hold its territory.\n\nWhat happens after the Felinoid Wars? What are you going to do with all of the Felinoid technology you found on the way out?\n\nThe end of the last battle.\n\nWe are currently aiming to get the next update (v1.1), the 1.1: The War for Felinium, released by the end of 2016. However we may be delayed depending on the game release schedule for the rest of 2016. Keep an eye on this thread for any updates.\n\nIn the game you find yourself fighting for your life against an army of Felinoid-like creatures, and you're the only ones that can stop them, and save the galaxy.\n\nWe also have a forum section in this game called The War at the Top. It's all about the progress being made in the game and we try to do our part to help out.\n\nThe War at the Top\n\nThe Felinoid Wars Update 1.1\n\nHere is a preview image with the new graphics assets that were added by the community.\n\nAlso we have a short game, a single player challenge. It's called The Imperial Felinoid Wars and it's a little bit more open. It also has an original soundtrack by the awesome Kevin MacLeod:\n\nIn this game you do not fight your way out of space and you are just a soldier trying to survive.\n\nIn this game we want to make sure that each challenge has a real sense of purpose and it's actually something that the players can work for and are actually rewarded for. Something like the military objectives in the game.\n\nAs a side note, this game is not our main focus. We only released a very early beta version for a couple hours and we would like to have a big enough beta test to give it enough life to actually be enjoyable. A successful beta test will do a lot to take a new game to the next stage and hopefully eventually a commercial release.\n\nHere's a link to the game:\n\nImperial Felinoid Wars Download","token_len":617,"entropy":[8.4579,2.4029,7.8619,8.0582,3.7769,3.66,9.4012,2.3267,9.8054,8.2886,0.0164,4.9135,1.2961,4.2508,4.5675,2.9449,3.5331,0.8661,3.6208,5.036,2.6183,3.6682,1.0833,2.2994,4.3436,2.337,3.2172,1.6775,6.5835,0.6441,0.8709,3.802,5.3955,3.2194,1.2636,5.7857,0.472,0.7354,1.9574,0.0068,5.2197,1.107,5.4205,0.0504,0.9573,5.4502,1.5099,0.15,0.1771,4.1418,1.9749,1.0287,2.5673,0.0921,0.3867,4.4489,5.3424,2.1583,3.8988,0.8175,2.9296,0.4494,4.7632,0.2209,0.4884,3.1402,2.3907,1.7217,0.0002,3.8356,5.2414,5.9155,1.408,5.4353,0.7076,5.8391,0.0087,3.9713,1.0241,4.3389,4.1922,6.2074,2.1726,0.7783,0.0002,2.5697,5.3119,2.9055,2.3496,0.3054,1.8243,6.1801,0.5198,0.1206,2.3428,0.5069,0.82,2.0513,0.005,0.4278,1.8562,2.3997,4.6796,0.1736,0.3318,0.9675,0.0098,0.55,3.9468,0.3439,0.1413,1.0366,0.9745,0.1132,0.0002,4.5003,1.9119,4.9283,1.0326,2.7399,3.3877,1.8675,0.0306,5.8776,3.0708,4.7714,6.0305,5.6553,1.8947,0.1032,0.5881,0.6284,0.0002,3.1063,5.9759,3.3559,0.0325,0.0049,3.3619,2.7394,3.322,0.2797,0.0278,0.7833,1.5845,3.0818,2.3406,1.6085,1.0262,0.3721,0.5714,0.9794,0.0577,1.4561,2.5111,1.0994,1.8596,0.3921,0.2911,0.0002,5.2287,0.0756,0.5356,3.4743,4.1476,1.4666,4.7329,0.2279,0.0349,0.1209,1.754,2.3056,2.575,1.3363,3.34,1.6432,0.9049,5.2115,0.2984,3.519,0.9941,0.2815,0.426,1.1502,3.2181,5.2847,1.1064,3.2235,2.1327,3.5601,1.0816,0.3674,0.0002,4.1434,3.3007,3.318,0.5102,1.3709,0.0287,0.1056,0.396,0.4522,2.8531,3.3733,2.7747,0.9025,0.0076,0.0853,1.1219,2.38,1.8954,1.5171,1.6852,0.0382,0.6601,2.4131,1.3885,2.9422,1.8853,1.1488,5.0056,3.3016,0.2362,0.6584,0.0002,2.3619,5.8161,0.3103,0.2976,6.1324,4.7894,2.6616,1.3014,0.0002,4.9376,1.8934,3.2681,4.8172,0.6687,3.5021,0.8797,6.0147,2.4009,4.8482,3.0953,1.0856,0.0128,1.833,5.0363,2.843,4.0543,0.0929,1.3917,5.3546,2.6319,3.2695,3.8041,0.6582,0.0677,1.2875,1.2586,2.4687,1.8413,0.6445,0.143,0.0034,3.4493,0.2806,3.4776,2.8551,3.1739,1.5972,2.9974,2.7418,0.036,1.2386,4.2285,4.2967,0.6229,2.2088,1.7137,1.2409,0.0019,0.6204,0.4101,6.7095,0.7635,0.0048,0.4372,2.268,2.0018,0.5718,2.1497,1.1954,1.2468,0.3694,0.0002,3.9498,1.0149,5.9427,1.8945,5.324,0.9206,4.2365,1.0876,2.073,0.4384,0.9891,2.5414,2.022,0.0865,0.9013,0.0182,0.8974,4.3052,2.5586,1.1639,2.1088,2.341,1.692,3.1328,3.1692,0.4182,3.8538,1.9139,0.2294,1.185,0.2148,3.759,2.247,2.7412,0.5308,0.4225,0.6149,0.5487,0.0002,3.7095,4.5801,0.9233,1.0263,5.4927,2.9756,4.1105,3.1367,2.0384,2.8319,2.3974,2.642,6.9312,1.4456,5.736,1.9912,2.5091,0.7624,5.3458,0.1049,1.0813,4.5673,4.8668,0.0199,1.4926,0.45,0.3116,1.3575,3.9581,3.9131,0.1234,5.1862,1.3295,4.3363,0.3325,1.9955,2.291,1.9012,0.6255,0.0002,2.3216,1.1367,0.198,0.0138,0.0192,1.3363,0.0002,2.0562,2.7195,0.0146,0.1,0.9545,5.2984,1.2782,0.0316,0.257,2.8764,0.0002,4.8628,1.0489,0.7214,2.999,5.0324,4.9009,1.3224,1.746,4.3437,6.2052,2.7552,2.2085,1.904,4.8942,1.2345,3.5403,1.1912,0.4716,0.0002,4.9944,2.8471,0.9419,1.0319,4.3713,4.9477,6.1816,2.4784,4.2227,0.5869,4.4856,2.6713,1.8443,0.6849,2.1625,1.4952,5.1308,0.4065,0.0236,0.011,0.3665,1.4579,0.9057,0.6351,1.6108,3.7307,1.5501,2.7793,6.2705,3.7385,2.3465,3.7281,1.1033,2.972,5.636,0.39,1.6245,2.402,2.0129,5.4751,0.4838,0.3307,4.0779,0.4878,0.0002,4.088,1.5557,0.8087,0.2026,5.688,0.9959,3.1307,3.4179,0.1437,1.6269,0.4057,0.9538,3.8437,1.2568,2.7194,5.0612,1.7516,3.618,2.4979,0.0125,0.8778,1.0298,1.1597,0.0002,3.0736,0.9113,0.5308,3.1181,3.398,0.5086,2.5964,1.2712,0.4215,5.0388,4.4791,1.3796,0.8482,4.2963,2.8863,0.0555,3.459,1.052,4.0272,1.0675,5.2455,3.6398,0.9555,2.3008,2.1675,0.7712,4.1808,3.5532,1.9581,5.5511,3.1137,4.0295,0.1925,0.542,6.6205,2.4429,1.8843,5.4483,4.7495,0.5511,1.8564,1.4562,1.1138,0.441,0.0002,4.4073,2.0318,2.9964,0.1602,0.7904,2.721,0.6828,0.7788,2.3804,5.0953,1.4679,0.493,1.8538,1.0525,3.8316,3.2481,3.4025,4.5131,1.6384,4.5814,0.9357,3.1801,2.5142,2.146,5.164,1.519,1.5383,4.5349,0.8265,0.0757,3.6665,1.2996,5.2417,4.8708,3.1778,2.1303,0.8918,3.9373,2.9515,5.0419,3.1024,0.9906,3.167,0.9168,4.4128,0.79,5.5249,6.119,0.4387,0.134,0.9881,6.3439,2.14,0.1459,0.9416,5.9146,4.6287,3.5258,0.4225,1.572,0.2807,0.057,3.1013,1.7712,3.5461,4.6741,3.0833,3.9268,0.1493,0.2058,0.2991,0.0002,3.2903,2.2048,0.6453,2.4722,0.083,0.4524,1.9653,1.6961,0.9073,0.0002,3.9881,0.0012,0.0231,0.0025,0.002,0.0247,6.4144]}

I hope you have the same sentiments for these poor souls.\n\n\nFor your own sake and the sake of others, never attempt to pronounce any final words to the person with whom one is thinking of parting.

He said, \"Pray for my family.\" I replied, \"Yes, doctor, pray for me.\"\n\nI am a born-again Christian, and although I'm a young man, I felt that those words, those last words, were what the AIDS patient needed. I wrote them down and never forgot them.\n\nThey still mean something to me today. I've been reading over them, trying not to forget them. And so has the patient's family.\n\nThey have been very supportive of what I've been trying to do, and what I tried to do for them. Their support has only been great. They are going along with the program just as if the patient's final words had never happened.\n\nIn some ways, I feel I'm taking the message from God, and bringing it to some of these people for this final goodbye. Many of the AIDS patients are living their daily lives as if those words never occurred. How sad!\n\nPerhaps it's time that they take a look around. Let all of these people look around, not as if there was ever a person on this earth living their \"last day,\" but for everyone around them.\n\nAs they take a look, see what kind of a better world it would be if there were no more people with AIDS, no more dying, no more loneliness in their days.","token_len":618,"entropy":[11.799,2.3137,7.8052,0.0957,3.6478,1.7991,1.4819,3.8261,8.7513,2.2622,1.8454,1.7294,1.3757,7.872,3.0171,2.0112,3.8846,1.0873,0.8659,1.5066,0.0107,3.2343,1.4582,0.1257,1.2129,0.0156,0.1816,0.0158,0.1015,0.0272,0.0181,0.0034,0.0019,0.0249,0.013,0.0432,0.0021,0.0016,0.005,0.0015,0.0027,3.8644,0.0002,4.7805,5.5652,6.3384,4.1153,0.0664,5.026,2.055,5.6943,1.473,2.842,3.5233,1.0496,1.3357,0.2669,4.5968,1.1746,5.7337,0.3418,1.8758,2.4045,1.8677,3.9598,2.3937,0.6685,3.7861,2.3186,2.8096,1.4001,0.5942,0.7124,1.179,0.0003,5.2144,1.5942,0.5555,0.0361,0.0247,0.5498,1.3798,0.0001,1.8452,0.1039,0.0049,0.0033,0.001,0.003,0.0003,0.0001,0.001,0.0009,0.0014,0.0006,0.0018,0.0024,0.0009,0.0006,0.0009,0.0009,0.0055,0.0005,0.0006,0.0011,0.0011,0.0003,0.0002,0.0005,0.002,0.001,0.0003,0.0008,1.3958,0.0002,7.2906,4.9828,2.8213,0.9375,2.6414,1.0258,0.291,0.0037,2.2829,0.7929,5.3444,4.6969,0.4625,5.6092,3.9515,4.1001,0.1765,3.4576,2.6118,3.408,5.0134,0.1706,3.5994,0.746,4.7416,0.1668,0.8999,0.2802,3.4148,2.0601,1.2626,1.2597,0.158,2.7154,5.9053,2.7684,4.1147,4.0566,1.6657,3.0047,2.526,0.6452,0.9771,0.1972,0.9072,5.0823,2.1279,3.0422,2.3793,2.8402,2.5115,1.954,1.5911,2.0681,1.5773,0.6029,0.205,1.0968,0.0003,3.5918,4.8536,0.3122,3.3986,2.019,3.86,5.775,0.469,1.0182,0.6936,1.6497,0.0002,2.8216,3.7042,4.8973,3.1359,5.1468,5.1564,2.5762,3.2751,2.6155,4.7956,3.2394,3.4739,0.2646,2.0821,0.7627,1.0523,2.3907,0.0002,1.0343,0.0243,0.0046,0.0005,0.0246,0.0013,0.0016,0.0017,0.0017,0.0008,0.0009,0.0004,0.0011,0.0004,0.0002,0.0008,0.1697,0.0002,1.8924,2.9909,4.5112,1.8719,1.9975,4.2925,2.4766,1.2608,4.5163,5.5256,0.002,2.9598,2.7915,4.839,3.0917,0.6764,0.0247,1.1398,5.8108,1.1618,1.3637,1.4856,0.3848,1.2801,0.0002,4.3996,2.3127,1.4206,0.4345,1.0049,2.551,1.2955,1.256,0.1158,2.2884,4.4257,4.9787,1.5946,2.5221,1.9528,0.8065,2.8378,1.7442,2.008,1.4039,2.9954,4.4441,0.2389,2.0516,0.343,1.0823,0.0002,0.0713,0.002,0.0018,0.0009,0.0009,8.8851,0.0039,0.0016,0.0012,3.7326,0.0048,0.0012,0.0045,0.0021,0.1288,0.0002,1.7724,5.0092,0.5647,0.041,3.9036,2.4908,0.7989,3.9719,3.234,2.2115,5.7311,2.2047,1.8024,0.4588,2.1985,3.1293,5.9296,0.5455,2.2376,0.0002,5.6355,2.3841,1.3161,0.4593,5.301,0.0069,0.7255,4.414,4.2109,2.0414,2.9842,2.5021,2.8258,1.8984,0.3931,0.2702,6.1592,0.5617,0.3876,4.6805,0.3034,3.4039,0.9741,4.1349,3.1453,4.8625,4.2689,0.9764,1.2218,1.6515,0.6985,0.1131,5.494,0.3416,0.3766,3.1387,1.1853,0.7281,0.9543,3.8991,0.1959,0.0267,3.6353,0.2217,4.0614,0.7667,1.9607,0.0308,2.5204,0.7091,1.8054,0.0003,0.9894,4.2202,2.2864,5.1102,0.8701,0.0089,0.1358,1.0337,0.5136,4.8579,0.3867,3.2493,2.273,5.2395,1.1047,0.3658,0.2513,5.5195,2.258,5.098,0.788,3.5253,2.9938,1.318,0.2719,0.4398,1.0224,4.1415,3.2908,4.8634,0.2408,1.3406,1.6004,1.7333,5.0092,0.6058,0.3105,1.6056,4.8068,0.6039,0.1172,0.0858,0.9388,0.0003,4.5276,3.8908,3.1448,1.244,0.1672,0.0026,1.2369,0.2698,2.3601,3.5523,2.2131,3.8338,5.4337,0.8393,2.5519,2.7193,5.2653,0.0119,1.6716,0.5539,0.6664,3.4436,3.5069,4.4495,2.12,1.8415,2.712,0.5072,0.2255,0.7949,0.0002,3.7954,2.8363,1.8319,3.9229,2.7547,0.8337,3.8344,0.1008,0.9209,0.7616,1.2556,0.0045,0.3201,2.248,0.8377,3.3352,0.2488,5.8476,0.0284,0.2317,0.8758,0.7726,0.2592,5.4153,2.4418,0.7572,5.5572,2.0736,4.0549,0.5979,2.7867,2.0603,5.3144,6.2125,0.399,2.3494,3.1696,4.9292,0.9258,3.2017,3.2935,0.7185,2.8179,3.7916,0.1326,1.3323,0.972,1.7657,0.0935,0.7083,0.0002,4.0272,3.7772,0.5385,0.2246,1.405,1.3812,3.0519,1.5836,4.6485,2.0225,5.7114,2.2096,3.1586,2.1809,1.2832,3.6563,0.0343,0.4157,5.655,0.7984,2.6885,0.9853,5.1925,5.3899,3.1091,1.0385,0.2132,6.1763,0.6954,2.1738,2.711,0.2172,2.3474,4.4043,3.2349,7.0441,0.0738,2.4332,0.4654,4.0085,0.7357,0.4938,2.8302,0.246,5.9952,1.676,2.5224,0.74,0.0002,5.4966,2.4379,0.831,1.8485,1.9763,1.6506,4.1554,1.0169,1.6149,2.8719,2.7472,4.6434,6.8532,0.7561,3.3404,0.5835,4.5656,0.5438,1.8864,4.748,2.6656,0.6813,4.4471,2.1138,3.4892,0.4143,3.769,3.8891,1.2201,0.4457,5.3578,2.9703,6.4273,1.0377,2.0874,1.4777,0.0816,5.2129,5.4336,4.1724,0.3924,0.6256,0.9536,0.0002,4.2986,2.7486,4.573,0.6794,0.5397,1.7054,4.8492,1.8262,4.1158,0.0096,2.5615,6.3213,1.0642,3.1794,1.2117,0.1537,0.6127,3.2811,0.6161,0.913,1.8059,2.222,2.0861,0.2264,2.0285,1.5092,0.105,3.7969,2.1101,0.4042,0.04,5.0933,4.4325,1.8056,4.8793,0.4776]}
{"id":3068,"ended":false,"length":539,"gen_text":"Your elderly neighbor is often seen catering to her lovely garden. You just returned home from a horticulture class, and fresh with new knowledge of plant life, you suddenly realize that every plant in your neighbor's yard is a deadly poison. You are about to call your family doctor to seek advice on what to do about poison ivy in the house when all of a sudden, a sudden green blur flashes across the screen. This blur is actually your neighbor's cat, running across the screen in pursuit of a tasty fish. Now, you have the answer to all your garden questions! \u00a0Cat's are excellent trail builders and can easily find their way through the maze of your garden. The problem is you will need to set up some obstacles that will be difficult for your feline friend to track down.\nHow would you create the obstacle of cat's fur or fish bones?\nWith this guide, you will learn how to make a simple game that makes it easier for your cat to roam through your garden. How could you create a new game? One that your pet can enjoy again and again? This guide is designed to help you build some obstacle that you won't have to spend too much time on in any given game. I have created two game styles in which I hope to demonstrate what I have learned in this game design. If you would like a more in-depth tutorial, please feel free to visit my blog ( Link ) where I will hopefully talk about other games that I have created with similar themes. The first game is designed to help pet owners get their cat to explore their garden in a fun and enjoyable way. The second is designed to help dog owners get their dog to explore their garden in a fun and enjoyable way.\nMy goal with these two games, is to teach the pets using simple game mechanics, so their skills and minds are naturally inclined to explore and enjoy a garden. The goal is to let the pet focus on what they are doing instead of where they are. The goal is also to make them think for themselves instead of following a simple game. The goal is to have them realize that they are capable of doing multiple tasks and their best option for a particular task might not be the one they thought it was.\nBy having them follow a simple set of instructions you can turn the simple game of chasing things into an exciting experience for them.\nIf you have tried my previous games The Cat Who Would Be King, and The Dog Who Would Be King you will probably recognize some of the game mechanics that I have learned in this guide.

{"id":3814,"ended":false,"length":519,"gen_text":"The Prize\n\nNortheastern University is the first major university in New England to provide a free undergraduate degree in digital humanities through the OpenCourseWare platform.\n\nThe winner of the inaugural Digital Humanities Prize will receive a $150,000 prize stipend and four years of support from Northeastern and the OpenCourseWare Project. The prize is based on contributions to course content, instructors and course support. The winner must make $40,000 annual contributions to the OpenCourseWare Project.\n\n\"OpenCourseWare allows students to contribute to research and teaching by creating course materials with course content they create\u2014and to find online courses that match their interests and abilities,\" said Northeastern Provost William A.

{"id":4447,"ended":false,"length":605,"gen_text":"As a joke, a person runs a presidential campaign where they say all the wrong things to get elected. *\n\n* The candidate in the race talks about the problems with the other candidate, like how he's too mean to have a job or how she has a criminal record that's really too bad to have a vote but she does have millions.\n\n* And then they win. Now, this is the case for all three candidates, and most of the time this is enough to keep the people who were voting for the other candidate upset that they didn't get what they wanted, but this particular case of Clinton and Sanders doing something on TV for months has caused a lot of people to wonder why. Is Trump really any worse than Clinton? Or are they both the same old scumbags?\n\nOne theory I've heard is that it's because Trump is such a complete jackass that the voters are only voting for him because they believe that he'll bring about the revolution. But that theory just doesn't ring true to me. I've noticed that the people I know who are really mad about politics are not those who already agree with most of what Trump says, or those who are just very unhappy with the way the political process is working. They are people who, when they see a politician, immediately start thinking about what is wrong with him. Sometimes, these are the same people who are the most frustrated with the system.\n\nWhy would someone who doesn't want anything that isn't already in place change the system? Or, to put it in a less cynical way, why would someone who sees politicians as being corrupt give up their power? The answer is that people don't actually want politicians who aren't corrupt, because at the end of the day, their votes are what counts. I don't think that is the explanation either. No one's vote will be decisive. People will vote for the most likely candidate, regardless. The only thing that matters is getting the politicians with the most votes. And people won't do that. Most of them are going to vote for their own person over the ones who have more votes than the person with the next third of votes. This isn't what you would do in real life, but it's what you can do with a voting computer. That is, if your software doesn't actually try to fool you, the voter's will is likely to be what really counts.\n\nSo, yes, I think Clinton is a better, more sensible candidate than some of the other people standing in the elections. But I don't mean that she's better for this particular election, and I don't think you should vote for her. The only time that it makes sense to vote for someone is when they are the least bad option. Clinton isn't less terrible than any of the people running for her, she's just more bad. She is the only person on that list who even comes close to being a perfectly reasonable person.\n\nRead More: The End of Normal, And Why That's A Good Thing","token_len":620,"entropy":[2.2159,7.3014,0.3891,3.8418,5.3957,7.3483,2.6666,9.0906,0.4583,5.2007,1.2498,2.7037,5.1481,0.6503,3.2817,0.0429,3.2676,2.055,0.5066,0.6937,9.0215,2.817,0.0434,2.5087,3.9234,4.2933,3.9938,2.4304,1.9049,5.9793,0.8107,2.1649,3.7367,2.3601,0.9696,3.3246,1.2014,1.9246,5.079,2.0291,1.633,1.5879,2.3401,3.9152,1.4052,4.3585,0.9519,2.9098,1.8512,1.5015,2.8713,3.4616,1.8677,4.6543,0.3501,3.1312,2.6509,4.9424,4.5872,1.6298,0.8641,1.8065,0.5829,5.6683,6.0574,2.3933,4.1372,2.0665,6.0364,3.1924,0.8657,0.0001,0.9249,2.8907,1.0877,2.1025,2.7145,0.5625,6.5359,1.1376,2.7613,0.8867,2.4399,4.1696,1.338,3.0057,3.8674,1.4173,1.4927,2.496,4.6263,1.1584,0.4774,1.5726,3.8036,0.8544,5.9811,0.2013,2.557,1.3727,3.7449,1.4049,4.6558,2.1676,0.4846,1.0279,0.7726,0.8073,5.8051,3.7778,0.6099,1.3107,0.0003,0.7121,1.7566,0.0261,0.1682,1.8165,0.7551,2.6387,4.169,2.6601,3.8082,3.372,1.9882,1.9369,4.9203,4.395,5.4246,4.6776,3.8491,4.4508,2.7871,3.1532,1.5338,1.7328,0.0335,0.9583,0.1848,4.1639,1.6634,2.5811,4.7454,5.3078,1.9969,4.7214,1.38,0.6933,0.7494,1.2526,2.5846,2.4553,1.4488,1.5159,3.8369,0.3639,6.1772,5.419,1.1976,0.355,0.4595,0.6922,0.0002,4.5993,2.8386,2.6168,0.8203,0.5114,0.5396,0.0685,2.6698,0.2144,1.3733,2.6013,1.0373,4.4244,0.2092,4.4942,4.9347,0.007,0.6176,2.9629,3.1697,1.7827,4.6359,1.9992,0.1347,0.1649,0.3888,0.3211,4.73,1.7219,0.9377,2.0316,4.2271,2.332,1.2637,2.6451,1.2172,2.4392,1.8154,2.1822,3.5469,0.4522,0.0002,4.6003,0.1532,0.8342,0.0271,0.3458,1.9105,2.8087,5.0501,0.58,2.4112,1.2272,2.655,1.0011,0.2295,1.3388,3.5809,4.1168,1.0086,4.0872,1.1839,2.5667,2.9953,0.2156,6.4263,1.537,0.078,3.8646,0.2345,0.4803,1.0302,0.6635,1.0245,3.5276,1.6583,0.0723,1.2862,2.8681,5.2763,4.3487,0.5135,0.5936,1.7691,1.3589,2.9511,2.4453,0.5787,1.6747,0.5145,1.2373,1.1959,1.6192,0.1891,4.0682,2.1709,0.8014,2.8057,1.7309,1.6312,2.0952,2.6064,3.6128,1.3465,0.8398,2.1132,5.1127,0.6745,0.0745,2.1785,1.213,6.0264,1.8046,3.2149,1.957,2.2597,0.6512,0.0517,0.1219,1.2919,2.5147,0.4096,4.8577,0.6534,0.9281,1.8243,1.1395,0.8535,0.0002,5.144,2.2809,2.4322,1.0298,3.0368,0.0003,2.8977,3.9837,6.2425,3.762,0.0003,3.3066,1.8389,0.272,3.1437,1.5922,0.3043,0.6037,4.9207,1.3941,2.0903,0.4234,0.0772,2.3408,1.5916,3.0144,3.0183,0.2228,0.1471,0.3238,0.348,0.5492,0.2875,4.8697,3.7964,0.2232,4.36,2.5241,4.9652,2.8338,1.6323,1.4086,2.1864,2.7879,1.3016,0.6507,0.944,2.3004,2.4763,0.0003,4.081,1.1484,3.1741,2.5963,3.4963,0.0002,0.2841,1.5607,2.207,6.555,0.8673,0.122,0.0046,0.0116,0.0035,0.5333,4.6868,2.5289,1.2689,3.5555,2.754,0.3654,4.0003,2.0925,0.0003,1.259,1.5565,3.9349,1.8642,5.6073,4.6046,1.1859,5.7666,0.9292,3.7445,2.2853,3.9506,2.2477,3.2535,1.5997,3.0474,1.9614,1.0289,0.3238,1.5507,3.1071,3.694,0.7068,1.1203,3.0816,3.7828,2.9237,2.1089,1.6375,0.2865,1.2653,0.1779,4.5667,1.6035,6.0614,5.8346,0.1941,0.5227,0.3712,1.3478,2.5968,3.5863,4.1835,0.0008,3.1048,0.3047,1.7633,6.0052,1.3265,1.5453,2.2268,3.0261,0.0036,0.4848,0.1098,3.857,2.2047,4.6582,4.1767,1.0791,4.7064,0.9256,1.8273,1.7977,0.4452,3.1619,4.5811,2.0442,2.2535,0.4032,5.0405,7.7873,0.3717,1.5867,0.3304,3.7594,2.6018,0.0002,4.9159,2.4353,1.5625,4.425,2.1029,2.3954,0.008,0.6202,0.5674,0.7496,0.7353,0.7183,2.3095,4.7177,0.3715,2.5366,1.0264,3.1226,5.8689,0.3234,5.1811,2.0283,1.0031,1.3105,3.3332,4.8671,3.1054,0.0002,4.5171,4.596,0.0482,4.5747,0.3896,2.453,4.316,4.6634,2.8073,2.8899,1.2093,4.4771,0.145,0.7352,2.9209,3.5823,0.9608,0.2809,0.4059,0.0002,2.4768,0.9302,4.1587,0.0552,1.8734,0.8261,3.0093,1.1475,1.6904,2.8038,6.3988,0.3347,4.8465,0.8875,0.4508,7.1999,0.5735,0.2532,1.1318,1.8027,6.6334,1.341,0.3373,5.5614,0.8126,0.6427,1.4246,1.2252,0.0002,7.679,0.6297,1.2228,0.6059,1.4306,2.833,3.9789,2.2539,0.9271,1.6362,2.4139,0.4543,0.4885,0.0002,0.6284,4.2579,0.7848,0.5954,0.0577,0.2273,1.6513,3.2789,2.3113,4.6878,2.2882,3.8893,1.3973,0.1491,0.253,0.2633,0.0359,1.821,0.8158,0.518,2.497,1.0724,1.425,2.7724,0.6485,1.3277,0.7924,3.8172,2.0752,0.0002,6.4193,4.2476,0.2753,2.3977,0.4869,0.0951,3.6738,1.3949,1.7907,5.7583,1.2625,2.1212,0.3987,0.4606,3.3809,2.4274,0.5084,3.3178,2.226,1.7337,3.3328,1.6352,2.6224,2.3144,0.8472,0.6401,4.7454,1.4428,0.0504,0.1391,0.5952,1.6162,5.8247,2.2545,1.9197,0.5894,1.6162,0.0002,5.2587,1.5041,0.0257,2.1093,4.8646,0.6897,6.0336,3.5589,3.656,2.183,1.2473,0.6987,2.103,0.2588,0.0016]}

This means that there are infinitely many distinct possible universes, except for one, but only that one universe exists.","token_len":620,"entropy":[9.5837,3.7777,9.5604,0.8672,0.636,1.6829,1.6188,7.2083,6.4018,3.647,0.684,0.9225,0.5821,4.2177,3.9478,8.8842,8.0084,0.9871,1.9546,1.6949,1.2717,2.1781,0.0119,7.6825,7.127,0.2099,0.0882,0.0272,0.0912,0.0074,0.0109,0.0025,0.0033,0.0017,8.2304,2.3793,6.3685,4.3242,2.4643,1.48,0.614,0.9635,0.0002,2.4032,2.8696,4.6913,4.9153,3.0504,0.0019,2.3005,0.5428,0.8256,0.0002,0.1538,1.2831,4.1382,0.002,4.7044,5.5593,1.9624,0.557,5.9598,4.6285,3.7872,5.2794,1.5186,2.9954,0.4606,0.7732,0.3745,0.1932,0.0002,0.1081,3.1355,3.1027,1.0584,0.2653,0.3242,0.0134,0.0467,0.1332,0.0438,1.8338,3.6291,3.8419,3.22,1.1457,0.0559,2.835,2.5623,4.5344,0.1075,1.3528,2.2647,1.0347,2.6854,1.0682,6.2552,0.1356,0.1457,0.0002,6.8211,1.3758,0.7561,0.0019,0.0097,0.0371,0.0023,0.0034,0.0019,0.005,0.0016,1.6282,4.4259,3.435,5.1708,3.7527,0.6119,3.7161,2.7902,1.5287,0.0033,0.8054,3.2341,0.1444,0.0001,0.001,0.3271,0.197,0.0002,4.6652,2.9144,1.499,0.115,1.1377,5.342,5.9545,1.9012,1.5328,0.7696,1.7471,2.3721,3.9377,2.7206,0.7521,3.3757,6.4222,0.2966,0.0319,3.1811,0.7294,1.4045,0.0002,3.8078,4.1644,1.9983,0.0116,2.8996,2.4166,2.5892,3.3353,1.0536,2.7014,2.3238,3.1542,3.6952,1.4678,3.279,0.9441,0.356,0.0645,5.5713,6.8357,4.7358,3.102,2.2928,1.8759,4.6017,6.0977,2.6374,1.7542,1.4664,5.523,4.1676,1.4667,4.8743,0.5309,0.0362,0.5441,0.7466,1.5963,0.6032,1.126,0.0253,4.3842,0.1795,0.3454,0.4146,0.369,0.2152,2.3027,0.0762,0.5389,0.0603,0.1976,1.553,0.6698,1.9948,0.3917,2.1815,1.2088,1.5915,4.6906,4.4963,1.0026,2.5713,4.1398,4.8693,3.4554,0.0016,0.3723,0.4324,3.8988,4.4468,1.2112,0.168,2.3078,0.3854,0.0151,0.8766,0.6076,2.3696,0.4871,2.3037,1.1264,5.4809,0.4583,2.9915,2.0384,0.9816,3.0896,2.0227,0.59,0.4161,0.2286,0.1723,0.5283,1.1424,5.6364,5.7044,1.0138,5.9443,1.2956,1.1485,0.0002,8.8867,4.1168,0.0259,3.7217,4.3334,4.1665,0.0701,4.3087,2.3464,5.4152,2.0998,2.1739,0.3208,0.0063,1.5256,0.8911,1.6,2.0126,0.0654,2.3991,4.5081,3.2739,1.1462,2.4799,4.8651,4.111,2.3188,3.2568,1.6134,3.3321,0.1572,7.1325,0.8207,0.5771,0.6032,0.0425,0.1508,2.7185,0.2583,0.4379,0.4909,4.657,5.968,1.9188,1.3617,1.5446,1.759,0.695,5.6499,1.1285,0.3434,4.8671,0.1029,0.3834,0.2516,2.7693,1.373,0.6422,0.4073,4.5852,4.4985,0.4796,1.0125,4.4686,4.1403,2.2154,2.9118,4.2286,1.1426,0.5805,0.0002,6.0614,1.0814,0.888,0.0084,0.0082,1.5226,0.0043,0.0107,0.0513,0.0547,0.0017,0.0022,0.0004,0.0041,0.0094,0.0008,0.0047,0.001,0.0018,0.0036,0.0007,0.0004,0.0872,0.0002,0.001,0.0011,0.0098,0.0065,0.0016,0.0012,0.0015,0.0011,0.0011,0.0122,0.0014,0.0008,0.0035,0.0004,0.0007,0.0005,0.0023,0.0042,0.0006,0.0012,0.0067,0.0015,0.0006,0.0006,0.0024,0.002,0.0002,0.0003,0.0011,0.0007,4.8888,2.95,2.323,0.4465,2.2539,4.3741,3.5685,0.6354,2.5989,6.6902,6.4158,0.1848,1.3825,2.4888,4.4127,2.3245,2.6821,0.4435,4.6375,2.2372,0.0393,0.849,0.3343,3.8947,5.4169,4.0356,0.5027,1.4356,2.1899,1.272,4.0654,2.0523,0.9034,1.296,0.8122,2.4966,0.9227,3.843,1.7906,3.6317,1.6917,0.0078,5.9887,4.4123,2.5925,3.1701,3.2578,0.0656,4.3178,1.1625,0.2067,0.0027,0.4569,0.499,0.0002,2.7621,0.9849,2.5792,4.4207,2.3862,0.5973,2.954,2.2879,2.0362,1.082,2.4619,2.5668,1.2478,0.7059,0.3007,2.5515,0.806,0.069,0.1303,1.9513,2.2929,1.4102,3.8685,0.9524,0.9014,0.6493,0.7642,2.6821,0.2974,3.4784,0.1743,1.3678,0.8695,0.1294,0.5348,0.5333,0.7887,6.5547,0.1673,0.6843,5.6555,0.698,1.3462,0.049,0.1053,0.0247,1.3701,0.5673,1.0802,6.115,3.7209,3.1356,0.2661,2.975,3.5961,0.1174,1.544,5.097,0.0007,0.5107,0.2922,0.4583,0.1523,1.0026,0.0466,0.2806,0.032,0.3432,3.6103,1.2654,5.433,1.8182,1.7226,0.1909,0.1708,0.0848,1.33,0.0003,4.2291,0.7473,0.1683,1.3898,3.7381,4.7093,0.7823,0.5596,0.4059,0.5925,0.6227,6.2552,0.2735,0.1519,0.1216,4.9011,0.8679,5.0398,1.5691,5.3879,2.6246,3.2098,2.3355,0.2397,0.6878,3.2877,0.17,0.0638,6.3539,3.4071,3.7429,0.1785,1.9738,3.4301,1.9103,5.7361,2.5449,0.1678,1.2185,1.9102,5.1704,0.0862,4.8246,0.3177,4.1297,4.7851,1.2674,4.8969,4.3288,0.0002,3.941,1.7882,1.3416,0.8985,1.5177,2.4567,4.1748,3.6966,5.6196,5.1271,0.4667,2.4917,3.6698,0.6375,3.15,1.4184,3.4876,1.126,5.1765,2.5561,1.7001,2.6588,5.3026,1.1602,2.3811,0.2673,0.7946,3.8409,0.7762,3.7714,5.7888,1.2153,1.0946,1.4389,2.7589,2.1631,0.2583,3.2822,1.2434,3.1801,0.0486,6.1741,3.2791,0.3531,0.9112,6.6534,0.8109,1.467,1.8086,3.8059,2.9246,5.0708,0.1024,1.7073,2.2147,1.2778]}

{"id":924,"ended":true,"length":594,"gen_text":"You have a wasp's nest in a tree in your front yard. The HOA demands you to remove it using ANY means necessary. You are going to call in the Sheriff to kill the insect. The HOA claims you have no other option. How would you feel if this was the way you lost a tooth? This situation is far worse. You are NOT going to win this fight. How do you win this fight? If the HOA wants to go after you and the house, it's going to come down to these options, and the costs for this battle are NOT going to be free. (For your own insurance concerns). This is how you win this fight for your own good: 1. If you want the tree pruned, please do it now. 2. Do not call the HOA. I will do it for you. 3. Do not call them again. 4. Call your insurance company and talk about the liability. They understand, and there is a high chance you will be paying a fair amount for some of the costs involved. 5. This may be the difference in losing the property and paying a hefty price for the damages. I hope this helps you.\n\nWe paid $600 to get rid of a beautiful blue tree in our front yard. When we finished, it was so ugly, we just kept it. I went online and searched 'counseling' and this man offered to provide it for $10. We paid him over the phone and took a picture of the tree. He came out three days later and said it would work for free. That was six months ago. It still looks like it was pulled out by a bulldozer. We had to trim our grass, paint and re-plant with native grass. One of the neighbors' kids is a soccer referee and I am glad that my son is around to enjoy the game. I will never pay him under those circumstances.\n\nSo here I was. The only thing that stopped this from occurring was me thinking it was going to be easier if you went into the house first and removed the thing at the base of the tree. It's so ridiculous when the homeowner can't afford to pay a professional to do what I did.\n\nWhen you hire someone to fix the tree you put a lot of time and energy into it. If you had just left the tree alone then you may now have to cover the bill to fix it.\n\nIf you can't afford someone to remove it yourself and it's a tree that would keep you awake at night, then call an arborist.\n\nIf it's your home, pay attention and be careful with how you care for it. Most of the time a tree this size should be cared for within a year (not decades!)\n\nIf your home is on the north slope of a hill, it may have a better chance to survive if they take a little risk and place it properly and remove it early.\n\nIt's the homeowner's responsibility to keep their property in good condition.","token_len":621,"entropy":[3.305,2.3842,10.895,0.5879,2.4981,0.1178,1.9236,4.3405,3.1133,3.343,1.3397,2.6714,0.0508,0.9416,2.7149,7.8632,3.7045,5.895,1.1861,4.04,0.9795,0.7127,8.2814,9.1115,0.2356,0.5704,0.4831,2.1968,1.9651,4.2166,0.0411,4.7983,3.6976,0.8397,5.1666,2.3135,6.3804,0.6812,5.5283,1.5281,2.8515,1.1219,0.0002,4.2481,2.0275,1.5779,2.3032,3.195,1.2614,0.833,2.8039,2.2978,0.1706,1.6927,0.4653,3.1231,1.0786,2.7903,3.3491,0.9681,5.5508,2.4753,4.2913,0.4771,3.8542,3.0718,0.5618,4.1074,0.5443,0.8977,1.8539,1.5027,5.6728,1.6956,0.0187,3.2392,0.5577,1.3505,0.403,4.7783,1.7925,0.1877,2.3943,1.4908,0.4458,0.1674,4.2777,2.3206,0.3409,0.0002,3.6398,0.7249,4.1203,1.6237,0.5879,2.9757,2.9793,4.839,0.5977,3.5298,2.1769,1.8491,0.0122,3.8274,0.5324,0.0209,5.8968,3.4023,4.1739,1.9046,2.4445,5.304,3.4164,4.4981,2.2219,1.2527,5.5713,1.2266,0.01,0.2016,4.3408,0.253,5.4294,4.4239,4.2961,2.3119,6.2587,5.7655,5.0627,4.1976,0.6432,3.2262,1.0044,1.1144,0.5553,0.4384,4.472,1.2216,2.2348,2.6526,2.2247,1.771,0.5667,3.841,0.4833,2.4545,2.765,2.9701,5.1031,0.0017,0.6528,5.3182,2.3843,0.8271,3.042,0.4748,2.1931,0.0058,3.1664,0.8586,1.5898,0.4716,0.9163,0.0002,1.0959,4.0395,2.561,3.1088,1.2914,0.8691,0.1513,0.4563,0.7053,0.0062,1.9881,0.3464,1.4472,4.6617,1.7335,0.7938,1.4996,0.003,2.6373,2.2936,1.0281,0.5184,1.2964,4.9986,1.7948,1.3955,5.5095,1.3334,2.7688,6.6666,3.8224,0.6487,5.0732,0.6804,1.1829,5.0713,1.3839,1.9533,0.8784,1.5551,4.1933,2.3596,4.8463,0.5793,1.3551,5.085,1.9788,0.9149,2.1969,2.7098,0.5013,0.9289,0.0041,4.4451,3.8201,1.2106,1.7246,6.4873,2.2919,3.7737,1.9247,4.4335,1.9924,3.5852,1.843,3.8648,3.2909,0.8784,1.5155,3.3595,0.4986,3.2171,3.4661,0.7398,0.4527,1.593,1.2801,2.1069,0.0368,4.4649,5.9634,1.2271,3.7846,1.8865,2.1234,1.8373,0.0039,1.3093,6.1781,4.8205,4.5904,1.6737,0.418,0.6572,0.0332,0.6622,4.2091,0.5917,5.7879,1.0935,2.062,0.6219,3.561,3.5089,1.869,0.7541,3.5665,3.9324,0.6392,0.648,3.0424,4.2972,3.8683,0.7061,3.168,6.3314,4.219,4.2717,2.0978,0.5527,1.1245,0.8241,3.5404,5.6183,2.6518,0.4979,6.2255,2.9208,1.0175,2.0261,4.4307,0.9291,1.9069,3.1304,0.8502,5.4407,1.0392,0.0969,1.0739,4.7543,2.1422,1.5826,0.7215,0.8273,0.2197,1.0609,1.4622,3.0435,1.3134,5.86,0.5666,0.0288,0.6457,1.8758,1.7091,2.1685,4.3482,1.4794,1.7202,0.4182,4.9378,0.9734,4.8823,1.0532,0.0287,0.4673,3.0203,1.9331,0.7469,0.7578,2.2169,0.8314,4.8535,0.6581,2.4512,0.6857,2.7978,0.0009,0.2976,1.746,3.464,0.6696,3.9773,4.8712,2.5617,2.1342,4.0637,3.781,4.5145,0.1839,2.265,5.2083,3.7759,1.1735,1.1006,6.1329,1.1243,0.6353,1.5559,4.3914,1.8847,2.8405,3.282,4.9203,6.5105,0.7744,4.2635,2.964,4.0712,2.41,4.0023,1.963,1.9025,4.8112,0.6807,5.4222,0.854,1.3512,0.8041,1.618,3.2361,1.0632,2.3738,1.8308,7.0634,4.8352,0.2351,0.7542,1.4879,0.0001,4.974,3.6886,2.0172,2.0806,4.9336,3.949,3.8652,1.7419,1.6957,4.1158,2.7225,1.4514,5.4049,0.2864,3.0938,5.7758,2.929,0.8633,4.0518,0.0456,0.7564,4.8057,3.6317,4.6307,3.8701,3.6396,0.9183,2.4667,2.0209,1.3978,2.6133,0.4425,4.4818,5.0735,0.5528,2.3124,0.5994,0.0785,0.1604,0.441,3.1117,1.9789,3.4114,4.2807,4.1094,3.4273,3.0265,3.4081,0.5316,3.0423,0.5223,2.0595,2.2599,1.2051,0.6645,1.237,2.8995,2.9562,1.2946,0.5568,2.823,0.0001,4.4324,1.7312,4.5238,1.7217,0.3373,4.0261,2.5223,2.4357,3.0016,4.8412,2.1549,1.8904,0.1422,2.7396,0.3485,1.9165,0.1299,1.2127,0.5837,2.9421,0.6851,4.2075,2.7573,2.7184,1.9205,0.7243,1.3463,3.1677,1.5003,3.7096,6.3542,0.9645,1.2651,6.0918,0.6415,5.157,3.9813,2.2558,0.3798,0.6588,1.7194,0.0002,2.8262,0.4101,2.7435,0.8349,0.33,4.6522,0.265,2.6737,1.8706,2.3227,3.0866,2.9335,0.9117,2.5781,2.8224,0.715,4.7463,5.5728,1.6005,3.368,0.0782,0.0087,1.0595,1.1007,3.1556,2.2094,1.5809,0.0002,0.0046,0.7767,1.7592,0.0002,2.1444,2.8457,0.333,3.7538,1.8631,1.2426,4.6828,1.7246,2.6388,3.0843,2.0924,2.9601,3.0091,0.1211,3.6052,0.0196,0.2008,0.1381,6.1833,1.5051,0.83,0.8939,3.8502,1.3331,6.0985,0.8334,4.4638,0.5886,3.4467,0.0055,6.1225,1.5868,0.7846,5.0736,3.5011,3.609,3.014,1.9658,0.0002,2.1658,3.2668,1.6345,0.8786,2.9224,1.1638,5.8853,5.3766,0.6617,0.2645,0.2697,0.6205,2.3507,2.0544,2.7538,1.229,3.4422,0.327,3.1727,0.6671,3.0287,5.3953,3.908,2.3432,3.9858,5.3797,1.0224,5.8909,0.621,5.985,4.1235,4.8056,0.5276,4.3867,0.5179,0.7387,0.0002,3.8296,0.6069,3.9675,1.9039,0.1316,0.5199,0.1256,2.8576,0.8642,1.369,1.4264,0.4214,1.0417,0.5086]}
{"id":165,"ended":true,"length":588,"gen_text":"The end of reddit.com's summer sale ended up coming sooner than expected, with the sale ending Aug. 31.\n\nWith the massive influx of traffic and content created by the sale that's now starting to slow down, the site is experiencing downtime that is making it impossible for users to post items for sale and pay for them.\n\nIt is a very serious problem for the subreddit, because that's how most users actually acquire items for sale, and have paid for. On top of that, the lack of a clear and prompt communication from the administrators raises concerns about whether the site will remain completely accessible.\n\nReddit administrators confirmed to TechCrunch last week via email that the sale has been suspended indefinitely, and they will update us when this happens.\n\n\"Since it began, we've heard your concerns about the traffic we're seeing, and we've listened. We've now taken decisive action based on feedback regarding the problems,\" Reddit administrators wrote in their note to the site's users.\n\nWhile the administrators wrote that they have already set up fixes that they hope can quickly fix the issues, there was no mention of when maintenance will be implemented.\n\nIt has been revealed that the traffic from the sale has now been balanced out by the huge influx of traffic coming from the subreddit's \"Initiative\" section, which is where the items currently available for sale are being featured. The page is currently populated with items being auctioned off \u2014 but it's difficult to know just how many sellers are selling the very same items using the sale, and how many are taking advantage of the opportunity to sell their items in bulk.\n\nReddit is trying to figure out a way to balance out all the traffic from all of these different sides of the site.\n\nThe site has also gotten flak on social media for not addressing the problem sooner. The site's user community expressed complaints on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, pointing out that any information about the problem would not have been announced at the site's \"Ask Me Anything\" (AMA) session on Friday.\n\nReddit's AMA session with CEO Steve Huffman has been a boon for the company. Unlike in years past, when major changes had to be announced to Reddit's management before the event, this time, the company's top executives had already been there to answer questions from the community.\n\nBut Reddit isn't the only place where this problem happened. Similar issues have also been reported on eBay, Amazon, and Craigslist.\n\nThe sale is one of many recent changes that has led to the site slowing down \u2014 especially with the recent influx of traffic. Other changes include the announcement that redditor content was going to be restricted from being linked directly elsewhere on the site, which has also brought a lot of new scrutiny.\n\nIn addition, new features, like a new commenting system, brought in new traffic from the comment section of subreddits, which have now grown to more than 667 million subreddits. It hasn't been confirmed yet how many of these new subscribers are coming from the sale website.","token_len":622,"entropy":[6.176,0.9092,11.5625,3.0083,0.3644,3.4483,5.4646,1.856,5.8116,1.842,5.4293,3.6591,0.0407,0.5782,0.8307,1.6471,1.0555,1.983,1.2898,5.3835,0.0346,1.8712,0.9746,1.347,0.0004,4.9139,1.0008,5.9403,1.4882,0.0524,1.0527,2.7083,5.1482,4.641,0.854,0.7126,0.525,5.6319,4.4002,2.4736,5.1287,0.0798,2.7684,0.31,0.1568,1.7693,1.8356,1.3627,5.4019,5.1225,3.7481,2.2651,4.5381,0.6474,3.4129,0.6261,1.995,0.0335,2.954,5.1115,2.0236,0.0264,2.8711,5.1809,0.3956,1.0059,0.3742,0.4114,0.0002,4.0997,2.9136,3.6925,4.208,3.5091,1.1545,1.8435,1.0407,4.2108,0.8139,4.339,4.9716,1.1385,2.4175,3.2699,2.1849,4.9868,5.9435,1.1064,1.5819,0.1844,2.1229,1.5314,5.6336,3.3942,0.1343,4.3793,6.4611,3.0509,0.0025,0.1473,0.0329,1.2519,4.135,0.0025,2.9017,2.2342,2.5172,4.966,4.2117,0.7532,0.8791,3.2073,6.3207,2.679,0.9039,2.0357,1.1062,1.2541,1.2379,3.3669,6.2169,3.3158,1.538,0.0972,0.0002,1.6609,3.7174,5.4495,1.5589,2.2848,0.1078,5.3607,0.4422,6.7817,0.272,0.0686,0.8806,1.5856,2.7391,0.8657,3.5892,2.3102,0.9942,0.9406,2.6868,3.3121,4.5856,2.5649,1.2571,5.2387,2.5373,0.2356,0.6051,0.0002,2.5926,5.037,3.253,3.2482,0.7564,1.2346,0.6963,3.1302,2.5541,0.6508,0.976,0.7252,5.2166,3.3119,1.6249,0.353,2.0383,0.6614,0.6417,1.4114,3.8141,1.9546,0.9055,1.374,5.0377,2.3122,5.1075,0.1371,6.1995,0.025,3.63,6.7349,0.7728,5.148,2.8442,1.4572,1.7726,0.3664,0.8324,1.6498,3.3642,0.9967,2.0508,1.8814,0.2314,0.5271,0.1946,0.7323,0.0003,4.1436,1.1797,2.7554,4.3683,0.3455,0.6526,2.4444,4.4395,5.6368,0.1701,5.5077,2.864,2.8792,1.3542,5.0043,5.084,1.861,0.1595,2.1739,0.528,2.8494,4.2074,0.5848,2.0368,0.1904,0.955,5.8197,0.6797,1.005,6.2206,0.539,0.556,0.0002,3.5298,3.8054,0.5297,5.3167,0.298,0.9728,3.9163,3.733,0.1853,0.2413,1.1753,3.9882,1.9664,5.2322,0.9011,1.1652,1.3536,4.8779,0.998,0.0627,1.9297,2.9394,0.1352,1.2157,2.7668,0.7699,2.899,4.9641,4.172,0.7981,0.3208,0.9107,0.4509,0.322,1.1938,2.7276,2.2409,4.0895,4.9163,2.4995,0.3445,0.0727,0.3599,1.9629,3.9533,0.1962,2.7116,4.4122,1.4591,2.326,4.1164,0.4862,1.9462,3.7184,3.6449,0.0007,0.6767,5.5639,3.1546,2.3961,1.1605,4.2163,0.073,2.661,3.4199,0.1095,0.7467,5.6108,0.5352,3.2828,3.554,6.3786,0.175,0.3243,6.7366,0.6469,2.4813,3.0005,2.2633,0.7595,0.2342,0.8094,4.8705,0.4199,0.013,0.2986,2.7553,0.4647,1.9284,2.4198,1.2474,3.4258,1.2115,0.2998,0.1176,0.0003,1.7755,2.6131,4.4708,0.1031,2.9488,0.2392,2.0118,0.717,0.0745,3.3178,0.9341,3.2972,0.9348,0.4777,2.6571,2.678,2.0653,1.7787,0.718,6.1244,0.6788,0.0794,0.4133,1.4134,1.487,0.0002,2.0474,2.3491,1.7308,2.0686,5.6832,4.0387,0.7624,3.5465,1.3585,0.0283,0.5957,1.2471,3.9029,0.3787,2.2114,1.3478,0.6078,2.5577,2.814,0.9105,5.0799,2.2118,4.9665,6.2257,1.8089,4.1436,0.9913,0.5012,0.3136,0.2437,1.2584,1.3662,5.655,0.1971,0.29,6.3188,5.4017,1.1428,0.6098,1.8405,1.8507,3.0698,0.8805,0.753,5.3159,4.3701,0.8249,4.3168,0.059,3.4424,0.7087,0.0467,0.0026,0.0382,1.0836,0.0214,0.0157,1.5359,1.6008,2.9004,0.6262,0.3007,0.0003,1.5689,1.612,1.3475,1.1729,2.926,2.169,1.2987,0.0005,0.0004,3.2894,1.1015,2.323,5.4943,0.2626,0.3003,1.5958,1.9028,5.9285,3.9776,2.603,0.0231,0.1505,1.4966,4.6835,3.4669,3.961,0.0294,0.1747,0.9029,2.4312,1.8363,1.15,4.709,3.2206,0.938,1.431,0.2617,2.0735,1.1693,2.8025,1.2247,1.3493,2.5419,3.192,2.0793,2.9105,2.0271,1.2467,3.3487,2.7705,0.2633,0.094,2.0181,0.9135,0.8532,0.7713,0.4842,0.0003,3.1117,2.7765,3.9157,0.0001,0.6648,0.0454,3.6847,1.5557,2.551,1.3429,6.9186,0.1984,3.6138,1.1219,0.8128,1.5704,1.0786,0.7132,0.551,2.425,0.7187,1.3518,0.1301,0.4384,2.8886,0.3875,0.5814,0.0002,2.2838,3.0243,2.2292,3.0598,0.0634,2.609,3.74,1.8855,1.46,3.0814,4.192,0.2423,1.8758,1.6519,5.303,0.0704,4.1708,3.4819,2.9502,0.7121,3.211,1.691,0.0104,2.1056,1.6002,4.3658,1.2244,0.6036,1.1075,4.8579,1.0715,5.3528,2.3583,2.6966,3.1287,2.5129,0.0895,0.1331,4.4118,1.7089,1.8719,3.8025,3.8782,7.3633,0.5291,0.1786,0.1464,0.4499,2.7212,1.4477,2.5521,4.9661,2.2877,1.6116,0.1242,3.1973,4.9333,2.2656,0.3462,0.0002,3.3655,1.2056,0.6672,5.268,2.985,2.6556,0.6598,2.434,1.7752,3.3271,0.3934,0.9822,6.5975,3.084,1.7841,1.5648,3.9685,1.485,3.3537,0.4445,1.6878,4.6255,1.6163,1.1586,2.8113,2.9071,3.668,0.6488,1.8384,0.0024,3.8134,7.3027,2.4493,6.7826,0.503,4.4718,5.1556,0.0002,0.8689,3.5635,2.2688,1.7837,1.1452,0.7988,0.8931,1.5709,3.1415,0.7362,2.4672,0.2027,0.2916,0.1923,7.6106,0.8311]}
{"id":2032,"ended":false,"length":524,"gen_text":"You are awoken in the dead of night by a call from 666-666-6666. You answer to find the devil is drunk dialing you. You are asked to call in the year 2012. The devil states that he has been told that he will play a role in the next world war.\n\nThe devil asks you several time to choose one of the following three options:\n\n\"You become the God of Israel\" (this option is the strongest).\n\n\"You become the God of Islam\" or \"You become the King of North America\" or \"You become the King of Israel\".\n\n\"For your soul you're the king and I am the king's minister\" (This is the second strongest).\n\nYou must choose any one of the last three. God appears again and shows you that you have chosen correctly and that the devil has become drunk and needs to go to sleep.\n\nThe Bible and the Christian Bible have always spoken of the year 2012 in a very dramatic way.\n\nJesus called it \"the end of days.\"\n\nJohn the Revelator said in Revelation 20:10 that it will mark the beginning of a new world of peace and safety.\n\nSt. Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians 4:4-5 that the devil's reign of 5,000 (5,000 years) will then end.\n\nPsa. 86 tells us the final war and suffering of the end times will take place the same year (the year of 1,520 CE).\n\nSt. Basil the Great said in his work On The End times St. Basil wrote that Jesus Himself said that the year of 2012 would be \"the year the devil is cast out of heaven.\"\n\nI pray I won't have to be one of the many people in the world to be told I am a king on this very day. But I'm curious to see how you all think about this.\n\n* * *\n\nThanks for the great responses and for spreading the word!\n\nFor me this is an eye-opening experience. I've been reading your videos, watching your articles on my YouTube channel.\n\nI've decided to create My Blog and blog about some of what I've been reading, you, and what I see in Christian news. When you get some time, I plan to post articles about some of my other interests, like world events, and philosophy.\n\nPlease let me know what you think about this.

{"id":3082,"ended":false,"length":587,"gen_text":"All of the nations of the world are teenagers at a house party. Both of the `` Korea '' sisters show up.\n\nNatalie, in her underwear, is lying on the couch.\n\n``I'm too young to buy things,''' Natalie says.\n\nMs. Lee, in her pajamas, comes into the room with another drink. Natalie is stunned.\n\n``Did you and your mother ever meet?'' asks Ms. Lee. Natalie starts to blurt out that she had actually met her mother four years earlier, after being sent to live with her in Korea.\n\nMs. Lee tells Natalie she never knew her mother. That she never wanted to see her. A few sips of her beer, Ms. Lee orders Natalie to lie down on the couch.\n\nMs. Lee makes some jokes about her own age, but she says nothing else. She kisses and hugs Natalie, then leaves Natalie, who stands there in her bed pouting.\n\nNatalie gets some sleep. She takes the bus back home. She does not tell any of the other children in her school what had happened.\n\nLater that night, Natalie hears her mother walking down the hall. She says nothing, but goes to her room. When her mother gets to Natalie's bedroom, she sees Natalie there on the floor.\n\n``She just looks so young,'' Natalie said. ``Like something is wrong somewhere.''\n\n``We got in trouble because we could never live as foreigners,'' Natalie's sister said.\n\nAfter this incident, Natalie said, her Korean language skill began to slip; she did not talk much about Korea. ``People didn't believe me,'' she said. ``I didn't believe I was my own girl anymore.''\n\nShe began to wonder why she had bothered to try to do well in school. And why she had chosen to go to the United States instead of staying over there. She started wondering about her family and about her Korean relatives she rarely spoke with, particularly their mothers, for whom she felt almost no connection. During her junior year of high school, she stopped coming to the school reunion at the convention center. Her mother told her not to go again, even as she wished her daughter had tried harder. ''You just have to try harder,''' her mother said. ``The problem is just being Korean.''\n\nNatalie said she didn't really want to go over there. ``I'm tired,'' she told her, ''and I don't even know anyone there.''\n\nAt that moment, she thought about her mother and her father on that bus back from school.\n\nWhen she got home, she started to weep. ``I always feel like someone's missing,'' she said.\n\nHer mother asked her, ``Oh, Natalie, why are you crying?''\n\nNatalie said she'd had the same question before. ``I don't know,'' she said. ``It's the feeling you get when you lose someone, when you lose that person for good.''","token_len":622,"entropy":[2.1432,1.3473,8.0471,0.9682,0.3389,0.3551,1.7222,12.4341,3.3307,5.1072,8.3059,0.0641,0.8976,7.78,2.3904,1.0318,13.0411,15.034,5.5049,5.5675,6.1968,0.5238,1.9727,3.5581,0.0495,5.295,4.0024,2.3016,4.606,1.2869,4.6849,0.2417,1.7328,5.5122,0.424,0.5608,1.5084,1.673,1.9378,0.0002,2.8585,1.9052,1.4963,5.0439,2.6022,0.8067,5.2124,5.8477,6.099,0.8367,2.3627,0.5076,0.4139,0.8489,0.0002,5.8328,0.0114,3.032,1.5835,0.8064,0.5757,4.1763,0.1006,0.1281,0.0615,3.734,2.0307,0.0959,0.6697,3.4499,5.4155,4.534,0.4168,3.9788,2.5458,5.0893,0.6222,0.936,0.0002,0.2351,4.9392,0.3464,5.2754,1.5408,2.6903,2.9996,4.1395,1.0204,0.048,3.4704,0.2437,0.0016,0.0245,0.1824,3.466,4.9671,0.5341,5.476,0.1032,0.243,2.7467,0.5383,3.1301,6.1602,1.3352,0.4045,0.2704,6.147,0.7149,1.2524,1.4654,4.5363,3.8545,2.4615,0.557,1.1954,0.087,0.1897,2.0066,2.7476,0.2859,0.7858,0.0002,0.7991,0.0013,0.0194,4.123,0.3534,2.1982,5.0075,2.9832,0.9258,0.409,1.1188,4.7066,1.4311,2.6668,4.1459,0.5629,1.8878,0.0418,1.5696,6.6624,2.3178,7.1978,0.0018,0.4607,0.8313,3.7844,0.6819,0.8548,0.0016,0.0079,4.807,0.8361,0.5095,3.6254,0.4225,0.59,0.0883,0.1968,0.4659,1.1613,0.0002,1.3725,0.0016,0.0374,5.1428,3.8999,3.9705,1.1572,2.0958,3.3369,1.9267,1.2917,2.3733,2.3364,3.821,1.9211,2.6715,0.5514,1.4265,5.4368,3.9984,2.6783,0.1214,1.2986,1.455,2.4579,3.8411,4.3761,1.3883,4.3881,1.3344,1.8127,1.469,5.5054,5.2148,0.2661,0.6295,0.4227,0.0002,2.4535,0.0094,4.139,5.7058,0.7766,0.746,1.9283,5.941,2.051,3.6923,1.5161,1.9749,0.6246,2.0296,3.7934,0.1618,1.7994,4.3881,0.166,1.818,1.008,4.2735,2.6202,0.9394,1.9237,2.2101,1.499,0.0909,0.7916,0.7928,0.0002,3.5428,1.0897,1.2107,0.1527,1.1308,3.3001,1.5469,0.3385,4.1296,1.2218,0.0439,0.8934,0.4885,0.8889,5.3547,0.8639,1.4324,0.4649,3.5819,1.2492,1.1885,0.3946,1.2269,3.0353,2.3005,0.0538,2.7491,1.3635,0.8337,0.035,2.7695,0.1717,0.9438,2.4215,0.8334,4.4589,3.6032,0.2452,1.6949,0.7497,0.8625,0.0002,1.4938,3.4119,3.8195,3.6854,1.5858,4.7737,0.4574,1.8724,5.169,0.4118,0.3776,3.6238,5.4453,2.2952,0.4577,7.0352,0.3293,0.1478,0.0002,3.9448,4.5859,4.7407,3.614,1.2755,3.1685,1.2739,5.4488,4.0401,5.3428,5.2904,6.2065,0.3966,1.797,0.8859,4.1861,1.1763,0.2004,1.813,0.0002,4.5198,3.9335,1.1313,0.0887,1.3976,3.1682,0.4718,1.6977,4.9539,4.3012,5.956,2.9424,0.1176,2.1758,5.1523,0.3406,3.3365,0.0665,4.5753,2.1094,1.5272,2.0973,0.7926,2.2888,4.7375,3.2206,0.001,3.0946,0.3838,0.5176,0.2905,0.0352,0.0506,0.3396,1.1675,2.2138,0.0005,3.8315,2.0138,1.0801,5.9492,1.4532,4.2444,2.8955,0.2192,0.1332,0.0002,2.6946,2.5687,0.5919,4.253,2.5078,0.6451,0.7018,6.0085,0.4083,4.1331,0.4188,4.7361,1.2791,0.3108,0.1497,0.5438,4.1838,1.6564,0.6609,0.2782,3.7213,0.7434,2.3932,0.1885,2.605,1.4988,0.0064,3.7039,0.01,2.2424,8.4718,1.325,0.7773,2.1625,3.7479,4.5261,2.2148,0.624,2.7782,2.3921,2.0948,0.736,3.9607,3.7445,4.0859,6.3934,2.3519,1.2131,2.7736,4.9182,4.9241,4.5335,2.2203,5.6958,0.4127,0.2439,1.8573,4.873,0.8866,3.2355,0.0808,7.4353,1.7754,2.5589,0.0659,1.3775,0.0517,0.0017,0.1003,0.8042,3.7509,3.3633,0.4978,3.3563,1.2688,4.3251,4.1551,1.6079,5.6144,0.024,1.0459,3.5174,0.771,3.2689,0.1228,2.2987,0.0037,1.1654,5.1,1.5431,4.4888,4.6393,0.6374,5.4996,0.5775,1.0606,3.7144,5.0213,0.1885,0.389,4.5688,2.7035,3.7136,1.5306,0.0328,3.1033,0.4101,5.3635,0.1905,1.4417,0.0123,0.6701,0.1149,1.6736,3.8247,5.2875,0.3288,4.9864,5.0873,1.8197,0.2022,0.1212,0.0003,1.3901,0.0025,2.5782,0.4631,4.7623,0.0008,3.5411,2.249,0.0612,1.7326,4.5736,1.0665,0.9103,2.2526,0.4933,3.3019,3.1312,2.7051,0.0089,2.415,0.0568,8.8886,2.3525,0.629,0.354,1.2201,0.0005,4.6585,1.585,2.1053,1.5837,0.1585,0.3773,0.0002,4.0942,3.265,1.6227,0.1044,1.6517,3.052,1.2799,1.1313,1.4796,2.2579,1.2743,1.5967,6.3894,2.8,2.5955,3.0163,1.3804,4.0275,0.4306,2.2328,0.0002,3.8347,1.0407,1.8614,0.4704,0.4946,0.7183,3.919,1.2479,5.3515,0.2033,2.1654,0.4293,5.3675,3.7867,1.6053,5.1177,1.9897,2.867,1.2002,0.098,0.104,0.1247,1.6269,0.0002,3.1006,0.7848,3.2027,0.738,2.83,0.0857,6.7467,0.2951,0.801,0.5498,1.7691,0.8627,0.0104,0.2923,0.1088,0.119,0.2883,0.0002,0.9019,0.0002,1.0806,0.8766,5.6607,2.3446,3.8398,1.3252,3.0022,1.9417,0.5392,1.3817,0.8321,2.1912,0.0005,0.546,0.3233,0.0172,0.2246,0.1878,0.4366,2.1467,0.6269,4.6521,4.9664,2.8854,0.3022,0.423,0.3377,3.561,0.761,3.4383,1.4857,0.3645,1.6715,4.1419,1.2664,4.4693,1.1982,0.1601]}

A level\/map that's gone is the same as it was, and no special thing will happen to it.It's the main gimmick of this game.I hope that they'll fix this later on.","token_len":623,"entropy":[6.0348,5.9904,2.1419,4.3913,0.8394,2.6788,0.5653,6.4304,3.4674,3.5391,0.4669,3.2435,5.0938,3.5737,2.3924,5.1844,2.9856,1.0109,0.0006,3.1853,7.727,5.4847,0.381,1.1685,8.9392,6.1665,1.9118,2.9603,3.4141,0.0252,0.9812,1.2146,0.0092,6.1597,4.8721,1.6698,3.8222,0.4806,2.5865,2.381,6.3264,0.0002,3.8623,0.5716,3.2576,2.2618,7.2343,2.3285,1.7081,5.2381,4.9562,2.5423,2.2904,4.6635,0.1342,0.0082,0.7807,0.7212,1.8455,0.0006,4.2506,0.912,5.1094,2.2411,1.3736,4.9276,0.4214,2.7922,1.8226,2.2105,4.8641,4.1059,6.7896,4.7068,4.007,3.699,0.9444,3.4588,0.4392,0.8503,0.0001,5.4687,5.6258,5.4252,5.9719,0.5035,0.9416,0.7078,7.1946,2.3917,1.704,2.1892,3.5528,3.3366,1.9605,0.3694,5.1069,6.4298,4.7048,0.9097,0.2737,4.4508,2.2758,3.8195,5.1177,0.1598,4.1304,3.2933,4.7648,0.1644,2.6204,6.4537,5.2438,2.1561,2.4744,1.9428,4.1968,4.1806,3.3405,4.2796,1.2426,3.161,4.8783,0.4027,4.9403,0.5454,2.6988,1.7279,1.0397,0.4372,0.117,0.2482,2.0442,0.0002,3.9726,3.3125,2.7017,2.0325,4.3276,3.7805,1.6614,3.5508,3.6126,0.083,1.3526,1.7604,2.1302,2.4819,2.2186,3.0763,1.2667,3.5456,3.0575,4.0039,11.3359,0.2321,4.5316,3.5898,1.2022,3.9752,3.0607,1.3745,0.4717,1.0779,3.8563,2.6093,3.5351,5.3754,1.4337,4.1609,1.6689,3.1246,2.1381,4.8876,0.5855,1.8862,1.2779,2.6053,0.3574,1.5251,0.0001,3.567,0.6236,0.9278,0.0137,0.0068,0.0037,0.0014,0.0018,0.0004,0.0019,0.001,0.0011,0.0002,0.0003,0.0013,0.0021,0.0011,0.0034,0.0004,0.001,0.0005,0.0014,0.0019,5.4788,0.0018,0.0017,0.0079,0.0042,0.0003,0.001,0.0009,0.0009,0.0005,0.0013,0.0009,0.0015,0.0043,0.7812,0.0005,0.0005,0.0011,0.0004,0.0005,0.0005,0.0013,0.0005,0.0012,0.0017,0.0198,0.0045,0.0005,0.0009,0.0003,10.5117,0.0653,0.0014,0.0625,0.0065,0.0011,0.006,0.0004,0.025,0.0029,0.0339,0.0017,0.0019,0.0013,0.0147,0.0033,0.0022,0.0068,0.0012,0.0044,0.0024,0.0025,0.0017,0.0297,0.0033,0.0006,0.0024,0.0042,0.0152,0.0037,0.0064,0.001,0.005,0.0053,0.0185,0.0008,0.0021,0.0012,0.002,0.0011,0.0024,0.0012,0.0326,0.003,0.0027,0.0039,0.0011,0.0065,0.0014,0.0066,0.0015,0.0162,0.0021,0.0073,3.0574,0.0369,0.0014,0.0028,0.0042,0.002,7.4281,0.0027,0.0016,0.0058,0.0056,0.0012,0.0023,0.0029,0.0012,0.002,0.0045,0.0012,0.0018,0.002,0.001,0.0016,0.6216,0.0002,5.0343,6.3427,7.2668,1.475,0.7473,0.4697,0.0003,4.8268,5.6812,1.2023,1.5171,0.7728,6.3736,5.0777,2.9917,2.2234,3.6296,6.0562,0.0234,2.2412,0.3208,3.7134,6.0459,3.3928,0.8981,3.2741,2.9286,1.3652,0.9325,2.9676,4.8051,0.8028,4.7622,2.8725,5.4294,4.6688,0.6953,0.809,1.0576,0.0002,1.1512,0.0379,0.0043,0.002,0.0018,0.001,0.0011,0.0003,0.0044,0.0042,0.0012,0.0026,0.0015,0.0007,0.0063,0.086,0.0259,0.0006,0.0044,0.0008,0.0019,0.0016,0.0016,0.001,0.0002,0.0025,0.0022,0.0026,0.0021,0.0014,0.0009,7.2826,0.0205,0.001,0.0002,0.0682,0.0003,1.6757,0.0096,0.0046,0.0028,0.0002,0.0001,0.0143,0.311,0.0003,4.7345,2.4994,1.0195,2.3522,4.787,2.1691,1.4899,2.6275,0.0417,0.8163,1.2637,2.2871,0.9897,5.1664,0.8173,4.8514,2.3683,6.1335,0.0146,0.4127,1.6379,3.0859,2.7126,2.036,4.56,1.3033,0.835,1.1836,0.0002,0.5536,0.0112,0.0148,0.0036,0.0033,0.004,0.0011,0.0018,0.0006,0.0011,0.0018,0.0019,0.0447,0.0009,0.0011,0.0028,0.0009,0.0007,0.0008,0.001,0.0001,0.0015,0.003,0.0021,0.0035,0.0006,0.0007,0.0479,0.0006,0.001,0.0006,0.077,0.0002,3.7067,2.8613,5.5822,0.9115,4.0794,1.0679,3.6282,1.9122,2.2834,0.5357,1.4107,5.9189,0.9213,2.7867,1.1092,2.607,0.6805,2.3602,2.1501,2.7051,0.6929,2.1282,1.8212,3.1451,4.0422,1.3759,1.199,1.2488,2.19,4.5245,0.4445,2.5102,0.8787,6.8453,6.2906,2.2574,0.1476,3.4264,1.2115,0.2275,0.1235,0.9976,0.5207,3.5391,2.2042,0.0765,0.2225,3.7659,6.6339,4.557,2.7403,4.8731,1.4566,2.6819,0.2681,0.4433,5.5818,1.9207,0.2103,0.401,4.9643,0.2171,0.0034,0.0669,0.08,3.8869,1.7798,0.939,5.36,4.0001,1.8163,2.1179,1.8583,5.6475,5.8851,2.3026,5.9694,1.691,1.5993,4.2046,3.2031,2.2498,5.6252,2.2062,0.9065,1.7572,4.7111,0.6104,3.1881,3.5302,1.0238,3.3115,0.8573,1.9242,3.5393,5.4224,0.9047,0.9523,6.204,0.1089,3.6613,2.4054,1.5022,2.073,0.257,3.2477,0.7414,0.8093,3.7156,1.5635,2.1535,1.5898,1.1065,0.078,1.9723,6.3738,4.5718,0.227,1.5186,0.9665,5.8793,2.2601,1.3187,0.0096,1.5884,1.4864,3.8225,2.1419,5.4369,0.4405,0.8522,3.0842,0.4309,2.2948,2.6413,3.7426,5.6026,5.1546,1.4406,0.1308,1.4792,0.1755,0.4283,3.0912,0.8108,1.646,7.772,5.8775,0.5379,2.0798,0.1681,0.8537,3.3372,4.5748,1.6586,2.4951,1.5346,2.823,1.0071,3.6046,1.1112,0.6946]}

A level\/map that's gone is the same as it was, and no special thing will happen to it.It's the main gimmick of this game.I hope that they'll fix this later on.","token_len":623,"entropy":[6.0348,5.9904,2.1419,4.3913,0.8394,2.6788,0.5653,6.4304,3.4674,3.5391,0.4669,3.2435,5.0938,3.5737,2.3924,5.1844,2.9856,1.0109,0.0006,3.1853,7.727,5.4847,0.381,1.1685,8.9392,6.1665,1.9118,2.9603,3.4141,0.0252,0.9812,1.2146,0.0092,6.1597,4.8721,1.6698,3.8222,0.4806,2.5865,2.381,6.3264,0.0002,3.8623,0.5716,3.2576,2.2618,7.2343,2.3285,1.7081,5.2381,4.9562,2.5423,2.2904,4.6635,0.1342,0.0082,0.7807,0.7212,1.8455,0.0006,4.2506,0.912,5.1094,2.2411,1.3736,4.9276,0.4214,2.7922,1.8226,2.2105,4.8641,4.1059,6.7896,4.7068,4.007,3.699,0.9444,3.4588,0.4392,0.8503,0.0001,5.4687,5.6258,5.4252,5.9719,0.5035,0.9416,0.7078,7.1946,2.3917,1.704,2.1892,3.5528,3.3366,1.9605,0.3694,5.1069,6.4298,4.7048,0.9097,0.2737,4.4508,2.2758,3.8195,5.1177,0.1598,4.1304,3.2933,4.7648,0.1644,2.6204,6.4537,5.2438,2.1561,2.4744,1.9428,4.1968,4.1806,3.3405,4.2796,1.2426,3.161,4.8783,0.4027,4.9403,0.5454,2.6988,1.7279,1.0397,0.4372,0.117,0.2482,2.0442,0.0002,3.9726,3.3125,2.7017,2.0325,4.3276,3.7805,1.6614,3.5508,3.6126,0.083,1.3526,1.7604,2.1302,2.4819,2.2186,3.0763,1.2667,3.5456,3.0575,4.0039,11.3359,0.2321,4.5316,3.5898,1.2022,3.9752,3.0607,1.3745,0.4717,1.0779,3.8563,2.6093,3.5351,5.3754,1.4337,4.1609,1.6689,3.1246,2.1381,4.8876,0.5855,1.8862,1.2779,2.6053,0.3574,1.5251,0.0001,3.567,0.6236,0.9278,0.0137,0.0068,0.0037,0.0014,0.0018,0.0004,0.0019,0.001,0.0011,0.0002,0.0003,0.0013,0.0021,0.0011,0.0034,0.0004,0.001,0.0005,0.0014,0.0019,5.4788,0.0018,0.0017,0.0079,0.0042,0.0003,0.001,0.0009,0.0009,0.0005,0.0013,0.0009,0.0015,0.0043,0.7812,0.0005,0.0005,0.0011,0.0004,0.0005,0.0005,0.0013,0.0005,0.0012,0.0017,0.0198,0.0045,0.0005,0.0009,0.0003,10.5117,0.0653,0.0014,0.0625,0.0065,0.0011,0.006,0.0004,0.025,0.0029,0.0339,0.0017,0.0019,0.0013,0.0147,0.0033,0.0022,0.0068,0.0012,0.0044,0.0024,0.0025,0.0017,0.0297,0.0033,0.0006,0.0024,0.0042,0.0152,0.0037,0.0064,0.001,0.005,0.0053,0.0185,0.0008,0.0021,0.0012,0.002,0.0011,0.0024,0.0012,0.0326,0.003,0.0027,0.0039,0.0011,0.0065,0.0014,0.0066,0.0015,0.0162,0.0021,0.0073,3.0574,0.0369,0.0014,0.0028,0.0042,0.002,7.4281,0.0027,0.0016,0.0058,0.0056,0.0012,0.0023,0.0029,0.0012,0.002,0.0045,0.0012,0.0018,0.002,0.001,0.0016,0.6216,0.0002,5.0343,6.3427,7.2668,1.475,0.7473,0.4697,0.0003,4.8268,5.6812,1.2023,1.5171,0.7728,6.3736,5.0777,2.9917,2.2234,3.6296,6.0562,0.0234,2.2412,0.3208,3.7134,6.0459,3.3928,0.8981,3.2741,2.9286,1.3652,0.9325,2.9676,4.8051,0.8028,4.7622,2.8725,5.4294,4.6688,0.6953,0.809,1.0576,0.0002,1.1512,0.0379,0.0043,0.002,0.0018,0.001,0.0011,0.0003,0.0044,0.0042,0.0012,0.0026,0.0015,0.0007,0.0063,0.086,0.0259,0.0006,0.0044,0.0008,0.0019,0.0016,0.0016,0.001,0.0002,0.0025,0.0022,0.0026,0.0021,0.0014,0.0009,7.2826,0.0205,0.001,0.0002,0.0682,0.0003,1.6757,0.0096,0.0046,0.0028,0.0002,0.0001,0.0143,0.311,0.0003,4.7345,2.4994,1.0195,2.3522,4.787,2.1691,1.4899,2.6275,0.0417,0.8163,1.2637,2.2871,0.9897,5.1664,0.8173,4.8514,2.3683,6.1335,0.0146,0.4127,1.6379,3.0859,2.7126,2.036,4.56,1.3033,0.835,1.1836,0.0002,0.5536,0.0112,0.0148,0.0036,0.0033,0.004,0.0011,0.0018,0.0006,0.0011,0.0018,0.0019,0.0447,0.0009,0.0011,0.0028,0.0009,0.0007,0.0008,0.001,0.0001,0.0015,0.003,0.0021,0.0035,0.0006,0.0007,0.0479,0.0006,0.001,0.0006,0.077,0.0002,3.7067,2.8613,5.5822,0.9115,4.0794,1.0679,3.6282,1.9122,2.2834,0.5357,1.4107,5.9189,0.9213,2.7867,1.1092,2.607,0.6805,2.3602,2.1501,2.7051,0.6929,2.1282,1.8212,3.1451,4.0422,1.3759,1.199,1.2488,2.19,4.5245,0.4445,2.5102,0.8787,6.8453,6.2906,2.2574,0.1476,3.4264,1.2115,0.2275,0.1235,0.9976,0.5207,3.5391,2.2042,0.0765,0.2225,3.7659,6.6339,4.557,2.7403,4.8731,1.4566,2.6819,0.2681,0.4433,5.5818,1.9207,0.2103,0.401,4.9643,0.2171,0.0034,0.0669,0.08,3.8869,1.7798,0.939,5.36,4.0001,1.8163,2.1179,1.8583,5.6475,5.8851,2.3026,5.9694,1.691,1.5993,4.2046,3.2031,2.2498,5.6252,2.2062,0.9065,1.7572,4.7111,0.6104,3.1881,3.5302,1.0238,3.3115,0.8573,1.9242,3.5393,5.4224,0.9047,0.9523,6.204,0.1089,3.6613,2.4054,1.5022,2.073,0.257,3.2477,0.7414,0.8093,3.7156,1.5635,2.1535,1.5898,1.1065,0.078,1.9723,6.3738,4.5718,0.227,1.5186,0.9665,5.8793,2.2601,1.3187,0.0096,1.5884,1.4864,3.8225,2.1419,5.4369,0.4405,0.8522,3.0842,0.4309,2.2948,2.6413,3.7426,5.6026,5.1546,1.4406,0.1308,1.4792,0.1755,0.4283,3.0912,0.8108,1.646,7.772,5.8775,0.5379,2.0798,0.1681,0.8537,3.3372,4.5748,1.6586,2.4951,1.5346,2.823,1.0071,3.6046,1.1112,0.6946]}

{"id":1991,"ended":false,"length":558,"gen_text":"A New York City taxi driver, it's late at night and the shift is almost over, but ahead the taxi driver sees one last customer flag them down. In dialog only, give me a conversation where the customer starts convinces the taxi driver his world is nothing but a simulation.\n\nIn one of the dialogue options, give me a conversation with a customer about his dream.\n\nIn conversation with a customer, give me the dialogue 'I have dreams I can't wake up from'.\n\nIf you want to add these dialogues, add them before any event and before the end.\n\nIt is a very good idea to add them at the beginning of your story, and in the scene itself, after all dialogues will always be added in your story.\n\nDo you have a character who can change? That is good. If you have such a character, you can find one or more dialogues. Give a dialogues to your protagonist to make his personality come into the story.\n\nHere are some examples :\n\nGive some dialogues and some dialogue options.\n\nI have never found so many dialogues in a videogame. Sometimes, some of the dialogues are very annoying.\n\nExample : I know, you want to get your character from point A to point B, but you can't. You need your character to get from A to B, where they want to go. When your character gets to point B, you change the way your character will act, then, you switch characters again. If you don 't change, it is boring, if you do it wrong you will start to hate your character.\n\nThere are so many dialogues in this game, like many dialogues in movies, that you will forget very quickly that you are in a game.\n\nExample : If you don't talk to a group of children, they will start to hate you. It's very boring.\n\nIf you didn 't change the dialogue in any dialogues, you will be annoyed at time by many dialogues ( I found them at the bottom ).\n\nMost dialogues are very good, you can feel that you are in a story, and it's good when your voice, or any other part of your game, starts to get emotional.\n\nLet's have a look at some example dialogues :\n\n1. Give me some dialogues with your character speaking.\n\n2. Choose 3 different dialogues.\n\n3. Choose 1 of them.\n\n4. Choose your character.\n\n5.

{"id":2449,"ended":true,"length":584,"gen_text":"`` I woke up with a pounding headache, a bottle in one hand, and a crumpled-up letter in the other ''I never asked for that,'' the doctor said.\nIt was the day after Easter 2004 -- Easter Sunday -- when Dr. K. R. Sumanathan, the medical officer of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, visited the family physician at the Kolkata hospital.\nSumanathan is the man who is credited with bringing the issue of triple talaq to the national headlines. He had filed a public interest litigation in 2005 that has since led to the scrapping of the law.\nHe approached Kolkata's District Medical Board looking for a study to find out whether triple talaq was a cause for medical disorders in women. The board found fault with the study's methodology, however.\nIt was found that the Muslim women in question did not use any form of contraceptives and, in many cases, they had more than one child. They also faced the threat of violence from their husbands.\nThe survey found that women who stopped using oral contraceptives for three months did not suffer from any major medical disorders as a result.\nAnother woman, after three months of using oral contraceptives, was found to suffer from vaginal discharge, but her complaint was dismissed by the medical boards as \"tendentious\".\nTwo other cases were dismissed as \"unwarranted\".\n\"There was no research conducted. There were no controls. None of the families in this survey was asked about their behaviour as they had never asked for a study. None of the doctors in the survey were trained in research methods. It was an opinion survey,\" said Dr Subhash Chandra Pandit, chief of the Board's Women's Section. \"Not only did there were no controls, there were no questions to which the study could be compared.\"\nA case was filed before the All India Muslim Personal Law Board alleging that the survey was biased against the Muslims. Subsequently, the district medical board wrote back to the board's lawyer saying that the survey was done \"in the interest of human rights\" and that it was necessary to \"reconsider\" the decision not to register the complaint.\nThe court, however, did not allow the petition to move ahead.\nWith the triple talaq law now being challenged in the Supreme Court, the question is now whether religious minorities can be given a say in the matter after 10 years of the verdict. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has already decided to appeal against the verdict.\nThe government appears to have no intention of revoking the ban on triple talaq.\n\"The government is not planning to amend the law of triple talaq. Instead, it has already decided to amend two other laws -- dowry law and polygamy law,\" said a source in the law ministry.\n\"A comprehensive policy has been drafted for the implementation of the Islamic law to ensure equality to the minorities, including Muslim women,\" said a senior law ministry official in Kolkata in the midst of the heated debate over the triple talaq law in the city.","token_len":625,"entropy":[6.7305,9.9755,0.096,3.1076,0.8371,3.6649,0.5215,1.687,2.9179,9.0045,3.1381,2.7893,0.0178,1.0,1.1352,0.4785,6.4814,0.7066,0.0036,3.6039,0.0361,3.6889,0.3228,0.1104,0.0052,10.974,2.8566,5.1623,4.9223,0.8981,3.3432,2.0006,2.8552,2.8495,1.0225,0.552,2.8025,8.9656,0.5608,1.9558,2.433,1.1637,4.3755,6.4467,5.0223,2.2945,0.8034,1.2711,1.922,4.2434,0.0225,5.0846,2.1451,3.497,0.873,2.8705,4.714,5.3451,0.8559,1.904,3.7656,1.5013,0.6502,1.661,5.4794,0.1313,2.0984,0.1505,0.0573,0.003,0.3724,3.0197,1.3583,2.7435,5.5065,0.9807,0.8382,4.5138,2.337,0.0111,2.4693,1.0308,1.9101,3.2829,0.0399,0.0378,3.6526,1.4141,3.2415,0.5446,3.7217,2.3789,0.1306,2.6691,1.0598,2.6998,0.1141,0.5799,0.0061,0.0016,0.3878,0.4168,2.0911,3.9512,0.8267,1.7091,1.9423,2.8938,0.3015,2.9351,0.0061,0.1553,1.013,2.4066,3.5102,4.3745,1.9618,2.5856,0.0431,0.9176,3.1439,0.0,0.0197,0.5029,3.9681,0.702,0.3775,3.099,5.1721,4.1501,1.4245,0.0006,0.438,3.986,1.8553,3.4117,6.7799,0.0711,0.8859,5.127,1.3494,2.7905,0.1163,1.6268,0.3996,0.0012,0.0003,0.6867,2.5898,2.2067,1.9004,3.8406,4.3487,1.5947,3.3498,0.2607,1.8831,0.9635,4.5603,5.447,0.0653,0.3817,1.1305,1.8274,0.3301,1.7353,4.1034,1.5932,0.5143,2.7951,2.0728,4.4591,0.1484,0.8643,4.4842,0.8835,1.6302,2.4663,2.8206,0.0325,4.5312,1.9445,2.1345,0.0019,2.628,2.3242,3.0265,1.6618,3.5642,0.1127,0.0159,2.5343,1.5273,3.6829,0.883,0.3093,0.6921,0.2292,3.259,1.1341,4.6773,3.243,3.1992,0.0204,3.6119,1.0489,0.4748,0.6541,0.7072,0.2461,1.4918,3.7345,2.7036,0.2404,3.3812,1.3054,6.1231,0.5756,4.7579,0.0687,3.0784,2.6433,0.4975,3.5536,0.4941,1.8762,1.1854,0.9008,3.6063,0.5732,1.4894,5.4144,0.6281,0.0504,0.4221,0.58,5.8509,5.0234,1.3919,5.2191,2.6521,0.1658,0.5886,1.5875,1.3511,0.0449,0.0706,2.4301,0.3386,0.0598,2.0878,0.1345,4.0549,1.7465,1.3979,2.0029,2.839,4.823,0.3636,1.2276,1.6396,0.3236,1.9453,6.382,2.0202,2.2802,4.9419,0.6965,0.5079,0.5539,0.1885,4.9127,1.4717,2.5438,0.9442,1.9117,1.8159,0.3951,2.7217,4.2789,0.3658,0.9687,0.265,2.5074,3.1649,1.4922,0.6544,5.3924,2.2735,2.1624,1.9756,1.4237,0.7807,1.7859,0.9079,4.4923,0.0404,0.4626,4.5201,2.882,3.3032,1.5568,2.3199,2.6356,1.4089,1.2071,5.3262,4.8761,3.3347,2.6946,4.1222,2.8544,0.541,1.6791,1.1336,1.5656,2.895,0.0467,0.6233,3.9157,2.3095,0.5275,1.1495,1.5722,2.6316,0.4222,3.812,1.9187,1.1101,2.5201,0.4448,2.9151,5.2123,0.4993,1.3296,0.7456,0.5157,5.8558,0.6665,2.1676,4.2388,2.7161,0.0848,4.6049,1.6189,0.3191,4.1092,0.9725,4.3716,0.495,2.4273,0.2013,4.4001,6.1146,0.9629,1.7032,3.8376,3.8228,0.821,0.3547,0.4605,1.2818,0.8068,0.6745,2.0568,2.8472,3.8634,0.8864,5.2551,0.9212,0.527,0.8105,1.7785,0.0819,3.7688,4.1512,1.2384,0.7748,3.8841,0.1087,4.0679,0.0183,0.2074,0.03,0.0063,0.0139,3.8558,0.3678,0.4429,0.6253,0.4607,1.4201,2.3351,1.1236,1.9807,0.2872,6.8798,0.5601,0.0673,0.5495,4.5988,1.7745,0.2323,4.7967,4.1854,0.4175,0.2362,1.2714,3.2543,2.1946,1.8807,0.7703,0.9119,0.8601,0.6096,2.897,2.1607,1.3165,1.5886,1.2451,0.025,5.2985,0.4999,1.7472,0.1082,1.369,1.3081,0.9446,4.7528,0.416,2.6346,3.7018,2.5049,1.3645,0.5232,2.9902,3.1898,0.0044,4.4712,0.7912,1.403,0.2342,0.1972,1.4841,4.3149,2.4676,0.3425,0.0023,3.4827,0.0143,2.8693,0.3627,2.1099,0.7615,1.8552,1.7164,0.4947,0.5555,6.0199,0.8375,3.1305,0.0038,0.0005,1.8733,2.0765,2.8233,1.2918,0.3445,0.3313,0.1357,0.0033,0.2667,0.9671,3.5194,2.2666,3.1253,1.6515,5.8371,2.3355,1.9696,1.9556,2.4773,2.0494,1.6332,0.2477,0.8226,0.5328,5.5621,6.258,0.0741,1.6807,1.1116,4.7662,0.4081,2.587,3.4439,0.0145,0.0278,0.006,0.006,0.0032,1.4311,2.4902,4.3326,0.6718,2.0752,0.7092,0.0564,0.9517,0.7775,0.4599,1.8944,4.2123,6.4583,0.4106,1.1882,1.9083,1.1985,0.1748,4.5277,1.3683,0.1176,3.639,0.8918,0.3001,0.0004,0.0005,0.559,1.3585,1.1081,1.3707,1.2776,1.2773,1.5965,2.3811,0.2197,2.841,0.1291,0.6442,6.1939,0.9998,0.0012,0.0006,0.9467,4.754,0.1148,0.589,1.9222,3.4405,2.2344,0.1515,3.2754,6.0558,0.7147,0.5135,1.8034,5.6525,0.0006,3.304,0.0501,2.4851,0.0682,0.8705,0.4751,1.2197,2.7271,0.9115,0.0438,2.7695,0.1339,0.0978,0.546,1.7872,4.2551,5.1085,4.1804,2.9017,0.2254,2.009,1.8893,1.2119,1.6654,0.0141,0.4602,4.4001,1.9529,4.3699,1.9161,3.5592,2.8958,2.8472,4.0343,2.3753,1.6766,2.4376,0.6738,1.0066,0.9943,1.7682,1.0506,3.2359,0.1773,0.0183,4.2021,3.5681,0.0002,0.0001,6.7168,3.2865,4.2786,0.0018,0.5877,4.507,0.3542,1.3983,0.6873,1.6987,0.0016,0.0005,0.9878,4.0083,0.277,2.0325,0.091]}
{"id":4552,"ended":true,"length":588,"gen_text":"After proving your immortality by shooting yourself in the head in front of the FBI Headquarters, you now find yourself in an FBI interview room. You are asked to provide your DNA sample to the bureau, who will then analyze it for certain genetic markers and make a report on your mortality.\n\nYou refuse to submit yourself to the FBI as part of the research project, thus triggering a showdown with the FBI agents outside.\n\nThe game is fairly challenging.\n\nIt is a game about survival and killing. No matter what, it is easy to reach the end of the game. The game has you try to find your way out of the FBI and figure out why you were sent there in the first place.\n\nThe game takes place in an open world, so there will be many opportunities to encounter new things while you try to stay alive. There won't be any puzzles, but there will be plenty of things to do and new enemies to fight. As far as side-missions go, you will likely get a quest from a character during the game, which you will then have to fulfill.\n\nYou will be on a mission for the FBI in a dystopian future with no moral values, where death is your only option. You will have your own story, but one thing is certain, this isn't playing the way games are supposed to be played.\n\nThe game is broken down into missions, where you are given objectives. There is no real story of any sort in The Agent, but instead, that's as far as the game goes. While these missions are often pretty difficult, they are usually achievable. And when you get to that point, you have no excuse to stop.\n\nThe gameplay isn't terrible. It has a lot of potential at the beginning, but it eventually becomes very boring. You're simply shooting your way through the mission, never being allowed to think about what else you could be doing. Once the missions are over, you return to the same boring areas and repeat the exact same missions. Sometimes you may even find yourself in the same areas over and over again.\n\nThe game is full of flaws:\n\nThe controls aren't responsive.\n\nThe game isn't designed for couch play.\n\nThe campaign is not long enough.\n\nThe missions are dull and boring.\n\nLevels are hard to pass if you just start on the difficulty settings.\n\nThe missions aren't long enough to be fun.\n\nIf you are going to play, you are going to play this game on hard difficulty. The game is short and it is worth seeing if it is your type of game, but if you can't finish it at its normal setting, then steer clear.\n\nIt all boils down to this:\n\nWhen it comes to games like The Agent, it is up to you to decide if you want to pick it up. If you take a look at reviews, you will find a myriad of people praising the game. You might also consider playing the online multiplayer, which has a ton of replay value.","token_len":625,"entropy":[9.5601,5.3496,9.9158,2.6422,6.0623,3.2816,0.4733,0.0606,0.4932,3.2201,3.1487,0.0079,1.8854,6.3026,6.4787,0.603,1.121,3.7521,2.7815,0.0929,1.6494,3.4223,4.3756,6.1856,0.1892,1.0965,1.6692,1.4006,1.7413,1.1336,3.8622,2.3248,3.8726,1.3291,1.8651,1.213,4.7334,1.7397,4.0019,0.919,1.1504,3.3875,0.5098,1.6301,5.3517,1.8497,0.4333,2.6934,4.2545,0.7069,2.439,1.5755,0.9099,5.0942,0.2183,1.9188,0.0076,2.0088,4.7885,0.792,2.677,4.0979,0.4998,1.3192,1.1876,4.1857,3.6165,0.0027,1.2776,4.5978,2.5935,0.7181,5.8664,4.2348,0.76,5.1135,0.9763,1.123,1.1611,2.7188,4.2194,1.162,1.9877,0.0001,2.4473,2.0966,2.0457,5.367,4.9841,2.4756,3.7809,0.0001,3.3533,1.3505,2.9588,2.7771,2.0902,2.9471,1.7168,5.3032,1.3923,5.4141,2.4885,1.1339,2.2926,3.4261,0.9791,6.0897,0.1045,6.1708,0.5672,0.9221,1.0333,0.1594,0.1298,1.0894,2.2282,1.3263,2.1061,4.5153,4.9777,0.259,2.721,3.0149,0.3162,1.2651,0.1947,0.7445,1.9021,3.6813,5.7926,0.0192,3.31,0.6616,2.2951,1.5434,0.7434,0.7195,0.0108,0.0039,0.0024,0.128,1.0382,0.0002,1.4156,0.6356,4.0793,0.6341,0.4463,2.6749,1.1218,0.4477,1.4851,1.9325,2.1293,3.7113,0.276,2.3313,2.2443,0.3573,4.7707,2.6662,3.3605,4.2651,1.2496,3.0777,0.0448,4.5567,0.0379,0.1471,2.6624,6.5827,0.0011,0.0868,0.8972,4.0214,1.8318,1.4129,0.8776,0.3209,0.086,1.292,0.0756,2.2157,0.2307,0.6817,1.8902,4.6298,3.2418,0.1798,1.0912,0.1914,5.5972,3.7999,0.0038,5.6673,2.0207,3.1236,0.5339,0.0303,1.6275,1.1055,4.1047,3.0549,1.457,5.4275,2.0122,1.5168,2.03,5.8021,0.7994,0.6496,1.6059,1.8748,1.8801,1.2015,2.2641,0.8785,0.0343,2.7087,0.6261,0.7542,0.0002,2.6698,1.2122,2.0528,5.9152,1.6549,1.7857,2.5163,0.6303,0.74,3.2821,2.3065,5.2199,0.8969,4.2331,2.4648,5.2481,3.5821,1.9199,1.829,4.8679,0.3782,5.1491,0.5059,1.4353,0.2616,1.9801,0.6771,1.4028,4.8047,1.0809,4.933,1.396,1.5927,5.2762,1.784,0.6789,1.2858,1.6469,3.254,2.9158,0.0006,7.025,2.5558,5.3101,4.0563,0.7599,0.7181,0.001,0.0808,0.169,0.1649,0.6833,0.0002,1.6265,0.7154,1.1495,5.2776,1.9712,0.0563,4.6225,0.9804,2.8503,0.1807,2.2389,1.0525,2.3351,3.0668,2.9509,1.9848,1.638,2.7221,1.6045,5.4026,2.3758,1.0432,1.9567,3.0429,5.8041,0.6238,1.4009,3.2432,1.4824,6.6161,1.2867,6.3091,0.4579,0.0212,1.1287,0.6525,1.1844,0.1765,5.3644,5.0675,0.1942,0.9731,4.4055,4.1405,2.9404,0.2698,1.1005,0.8688,3.5337,5.7349,1.4263,4.9286,3.1147,0.3564,2.776,1.4464,4.6133,0.5158,0.3643,0.7748,2.9047,3.429,3.7224,1.6245,2.5892,1.0944,0.5105,0.0002,1.0808,3.0943,4.5772,0.0005,5.1845,1.3707,1.6849,2.6044,1.2395,2.5233,0.1528,3.5116,7.0736,0.8709,3.4063,0.6857,0.3,1.5372,2.8042,1.4966,3.5709,2.8373,0.5914,2.2176,4.0711,4.0257,2.7119,2.7352,0.1087,0.216,1.8537,4.5738,1.1033,5.0184,4.0762,4.8966,0.1029,3.1173,0.872,1.5873,4.6552,0.3656,0.5973,1.0342,0.0093,0.4149,4.5943,2.3059,2.1338,1.8382,1.001,0.1388,0.5416,4.6813,0.0634,0.4891,3.2765,2.9287,3.5485,2.9223,2.6075,0.4791,4.2215,0.0204,3.4932,1.541,5.7125,1.2124,3.4316,1.7859,2.0195,0.8264,1.7611,0.9887,0.2353,2.8336,2.1846,0.0508,0.0007,0.4015,0.4049,0.3327,0.0002,1.0,0.981,1.2239,4.2349,0.0059,5.4532,5.2407,0.7961,0.0002,1.096,2.44,3.1237,0.0004,4.9785,0.961,0.9048,0.0001,0.7828,1.3185,3.187,0.0003,3.7369,1.1548,4.8803,0.9672,0.4602,0.3204,0.0001,0.5464,6.0751,0.7177,4.2734,1.3438,0.7019,0.5346,0.09,0.0001,0.5352,3.2725,0.6843,5.5696,1.2995,2.5129,0.137,0.0281,0.0001,6.9962,1.0355,0.5214,5.4527,0.2645,5.957,4.819,0.0577,4.4719,3.7096,3.8289,1.0956,4.3199,3.0942,0.2328,0.0446,0.0002,0.8062,3.5977,2.7469,0.0002,3.4896,0.0421,2.2103,1.8416,1.7837,0.3097,0.0376,0.0001,4.719,0.2467,1.9731,3.5596,0.0418,0.7237,5.678,0.9555,2.8036,0.3617,0.0024,2.3819,2.1136,0.1934,1.4541,1.7195,2.2559,0.4072,2.6746,0.9528,0.928,5.1478,1.8417,3.4595,1.741,4.7992,5.3119,2.0646,3.4947,1.0942,2.4835,2.8564,0.1126,0.0746,2.035,0.2332,1.3546,0.131,3.7173,0.8658,3.4404,0.65,4.342,4.7971,3.9475,2.9338,0.1099,1.6173,6.04,0.0262,0.4568,0.4241,0.0002,3.9988,6.1538,1.1245,0.0023,0.0055,1.5104,0.3502,1.4767,0.0002,5.4025,2.1662,0.1335,0.1779,2.3787,1.9315,1.3461,0.0366,0.0861,2.1773,0.9879,3.0083,0.0051,0.359,0.5363,0.2898,0.627,0.5156,0.7303,0.1757,5.4803,0.363,0.0238,0.902,1.1171,0.1779,5.9041,1.8431,0.9517,0.0964,3.5232,1.0809,0.4385,0.5262,1.0299,1.9279,6.3915,0.0092,1.5946,3.2448,0.6179,0.0975,1.2805,3.4115,3.1046,2.3334,4.4208,2.7869,1.5956,5.9562,1.8548,1.8608,0.8873,2.9447,1.5906,3.1089,0.0233,2.1219,0.4074,0.3462]}
{"id":4031,"ended":true,"length":587,"gen_text":"Every once in awhile the deepest, most sincere thoughts that a person has are being displayed in a pop-up message above their head.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what makes those thoughts so wonderful.\n\nWith these thoughts in the forefront of your mind, you should never worry about what others think of you or what others think of everything you do.\n\nEven though you may be expressing yourself without thought before, now and then the light just seems to come out and shine through, and allow us to experience that special moment.\n\nAnd it makes all the difference.\n\nThat thought will leave you with more than just a simple pleasure; it will leave you with something more valuable than that, with a deeper feeling, with a deeper level of your soul.\n\nThat \"something more valuable\" is a deeper level of your soul, which means that deep level of your soul will change who your are, and who you are destined to be. It will change not just the people you meet, but who you will become.\n\nAnd you'll love who you become, because you won't need them.\n\nThat's not to say that just having a thought won't have a profound impact on you. No, it'll influence you in more positive ways.\n\nI'd rather feel something so beautiful, so deep, so wonderful, than do anything without feeling it, without having the chance to feel it. That's what I think.\n\nHaving a pop-up appears at random hours of the day, and can be a great thing if done properly. But it can also be used as a terrible thing.\n\nIt's very, very possible to waste a bunch of thoughts on something so trivial as a photo posting.\n\nAnd the worst part is that all you'll get yourself in the end is a bunch of photos that remind you why you hate being a Facebook freak.\n\nI can't even count the amount of times I've seen someone send me this little \"I wish people would stop thinking so much\" window, asking me to be quiet, so that I could get on with my day.\n\nAnd if something truly big does happen, then you have a lot more things to worry about than the small moments of frustration you have to live with. The day you regret not posting all of your heart out for a whole weekend. The day you regret not posting all of your heart out for a whole year.\n\nYou might not like taking pictures and writing stuff, but you have to take pictures and write stuff because someone needs to be reminded that they're worth seeing. And they're worth seeing because they represent something of more importance to you than just showing off your skills.\n\nAnd when you do post something, you'll get the feeling that there's something special in the moment that you've created, someone you love for a reason. And it will be that moment that will give you the strength to keep on trying to do what you love.\n\nAnd by doing that, you'll make yourself a better person for it.","token_len":625,"entropy":[8.3936,0.0832,2.2499,3.5535,10.9245,2.5852,1.2813,4.7007,4.2169,3.6002,3.2337,1.0951,1.4989,2.3058,5.5267,6.7276,1.5423,1.5535,9.2782,2.0261,1.9999,3.8618,5.1085,1.5095,1.8596,0.7928,1.8862,0.0068,5.9547,0.0622,3.9307,1.9911,4.0777,0.4605,5.4319,5.5609,2.4306,0.703,5.3895,0.6123,0.8455,0.0001,5.3087,3.508,0.8753,3.3316,2.1918,1.9892,0.6476,0.9623,0.1659,0.198,0.7751,5.9119,3.1351,4.564,0.2404,1.5895,1.6653,0.5621,0.8616,0.1839,2.3854,1.1166,1.4484,0.9175,0.6493,5.7075,1.2976,0.2818,0.196,0.488,0.0002,5.0811,2.0409,1.1742,0.9543,1.6973,5.915,2.028,5.6405,2.6665,6.7721,0.8341,3.4624,5.5112,0.3027,3.1052,5.3985,5.3929,2.0227,0.0442,2.5215,2.3886,2.0817,1.9879,2.1101,3.0716,1.4978,6.293,5.311,0.2602,3.2261,3.1269,3.8696,1.3417,1.3792,0.1485,0.0002,3.6385,3.0763,3.968,3.0577,0.3037,0.4469,1.0997,0.1972,0.0001,4.4155,5.5007,3.7861,5.4593,0.8177,1.868,3.4004,2.3542,1.1808,0.7435,4.3029,5.5367,2.9772,0.3367,0.0687,0.801,0.0997,0.2589,3.1182,2.0558,3.5898,1.0957,2.2393,2.6089,5.8105,1.0157,2.8456,3.12,3.1325,1.8997,0.6086,1.3741,5.1306,0.012,5.7912,1.7737,0.5588,0.0909,0.0001,2.8416,5.9986,0.8955,0.2426,0.3725,0.1725,0.7446,2.4866,2.9988,1.8505,0.0184,1.6277,0.7338,1.6834,2.1681,3.4297,0.9077,5.6671,2.37,0.1761,0.4343,0.0248,1.2838,4.7262,4.3845,5.4933,0.8978,1.4239,0.9578,1.6036,0.135,2.4627,3.6189,0.0116,0.644,0.2181,4.1864,0.3616,0.7727,5.3068,1.3996,2.1168,3.1438,1.3725,1.2876,0.4004,0.1294,3.0282,0.2299,2.4772,0.5702,0.6581,0.1453,0.0002,2.2563,2.9663,2.4027,4.3801,3.0918,0.0272,0.82,1.5326,1.1364,0.9475,3.2936,0.0012,3.6901,4.1322,1.4257,0.3144,0.0001,3.1307,1.2003,4.0502,1.0286,0.0411,0.248,5.6475,4.2077,1.8336,1.8602,3.7842,0.0003,2.8171,1.6896,1.3124,1.2277,0.4555,0.5229,0.5568,4.8992,0.5011,0.9,3.768,5.9061,0.3666,1.4059,3.0164,4.3727,0.1197,1.9825,0.6212,0.0002,4.4668,4.2548,2.5113,5.8241,2.5489,5.2705,2.8171,1.8311,0.5288,2.68,0.3694,0.3707,3.2455,0.9507,0.8139,5.9483,2.5422,4.9612,1.4837,0.5819,2.4665,1.6091,2.8931,2.3559,3.6107,0.0358,2.0391,0.3665,0.5022,3.407,0.2767,2.0862,1.0755,3.0984,1.3909,0.2083,0.0001,5.4231,0.6445,5.4808,0.0456,0.0024,5.3934,3.3206,1.9363,5.7433,1.6568,0.0256,0.0831,1.2174,1.0667,3.273,0.6216,3.2186,2.874,3.8755,2.4877,4.8385,2.2641,0.1962,2.7406,1.9952,1.3702,0.25,0.3842,3.143,1.7901,0.2581,4.1396,0.4884,1.2858,0.3884,0.0001,2.7541,1.1109,3.801,5.0686,0.0131,4.0892,0.6089,4.9284,1.2893,5.9369,0.0025,4.1363,2.3733,1.4773,3.1939,1.2947,1.2925,1.4128,5.7074,5.8242,1.1456,0.8007,0.0001,2.6848,3.0622,1.9193,0.923,0.3621,0.4951,4.4809,1.9199,3.031,1.9538,8.2777,2.589,0.9757,0.0381,0.0805,0.6678,1.9592,0.0075,2.9632,1.5241,4.9904,0.0418,3.5176,0.1206,2.263,3.6307,2.4102,4.3057,5.8469,0.2897,0.1646,0.0002,2.7183,3.4239,0.6945,2.2613,2.5316,0.765,1.6283,0.006,0.2566,0.4416,0.1762,1.3806,2.2522,4.8504,1.6568,5.0272,4.8246,3.9545,3.1113,4.0576,4.696,0.5716,0.8537,3.4549,1.6131,0.1343,1.7015,5.4613,1.9459,5.9144,0.4847,0.2872,4.5785,2.8475,2.3532,3.3075,1.1307,1.439,1.3058,2.7124,1.2272,0.0396,0.6111,0.901,0.1876,0.1896,0.0002,2.4872,3.8156,6.5145,4.2378,4.6636,2.8923,0.5433,0.5321,2.4089,1.9899,3.5786,2.8567,3.4494,1.9213,3.7193,0.1096,0.3765,0.0037,0.8983,2.748,4.603,5.2243,1.0747,5.2387,1.7582,3.2587,1.4998,3.744,0.2054,0.879,5.8168,4.9503,2.0933,5.2337,1.3106,2.5226,5.4534,1.5457,1.1061,6.1045,2.5398,3.6056,1.9457,4.0473,3.926,1.6264,1.4054,0.0991,0.2858,0.7176,0.2061,0.9175,1.0321,0.0799,0.0821,0.1305,0.0044,0.2402,0.4728,0.0619,2.2821,0.0676,0.6158,0.0002,2.9387,3.5027,1.9467,3.9704,6.4317,2.4244,3.7917,3.5142,4.3981,2.3578,0.2338,1.5903,2.2709,0.2459,3.2414,0.6463,0.1467,0.0437,0.1517,3.1898,5.0037,2.8401,0.4086,3.2645,1.4509,1.3922,1.0497,1.4327,3.1717,5.3354,0.6459,2.2655,3.3454,0.7903,0.1416,0.5793,2.0289,1.765,4.7554,1.3082,4.2492,5.7128,2.1441,2.7383,0.6032,0.4571,1.9682,5.2727,0.4556,1.3572,5.0822,0.6767,0.2033,0.0002,1.7072,3.0055,0.6699,2.3005,1.5064,1.5538,0.5493,1.5334,2.1028,2.2837,2.6386,3.5854,0.5366,4.3222,0.5052,1.1449,2.8497,2.376,1.9831,1.5317,1.519,1.0761,2.5471,2.1386,1.2075,6.1324,2.6181,3.5595,5.4922,1.8465,0.8619,1.375,1.9214,2.511,1.5209,1.7222,2.5641,3.0463,0.4682,1.2101,3.4455,0.1068,0.8342,2.3936,0.2043,1.5512,2.2167,3.6488,1.3316,2.3699,2.7696,0.2418,0.9772,0.9618,0.224,0.0002,1.7623,5.7111,1.4441,0.9946,0.1019,0.3175,0.3158,3.142,2.3784,1.6111,0.7712,0.3756,3.1416,0.7163,0.3065]}

{"id":3075,"ended":true,"length":614,"gen_text":"You're sitting alone in the dark in front of your computer, laughing at something you saw on the internet. You stop laughing, but the laughing continues. You're sitting in your chair, doing something you've never done before, suddenly feeling tired. You say to yourself, \" Well, this is the way it should be. I'm not a failure, I'm just an ordinary person. \"You suddenly understand that you're so busy and confused at the same time. You're so busy fighting your own brain, you forget that other people actually exist.And it makes you wonder, how many people go through the same feeling of confusion and self-loathing? How many times have you sat in front of your computer with your laptop plugged into your television, and wondered what you had done?How many times have you sat in another room, with your laptop plugged into your television, and simply ignored your friends, who actually did what you wanted to do?Do you think, that there's someone out there who has taken your thoughts, and made some of the pieces fit together? I believe there is! And I know you do, if you feel that way!You know that there's someone out there, who has taken your thoughts and made some of the pieces fit together. They even created characters in your head! There's so much you could do now that you know is out there!You know that there are other people, who are simply trying to enjoy the life you could have had. Who are just having a little fun with you, without you ever knowing that it even exists!So you might notice,that your friends and family are the very ones that you are afraid of. They can't help it, can you, so their job is to try and help you, and you can't help thinking their very existences depend on your failure. So if someone is around to say things that might make you think differently about them, maybe it's just the other people that you fear?But there is someone out there, with no personal agenda, who's just trying to enjoy life, and have a good time with you, because they know exactly what to expect. They might even even offer you a ride home once they make sure you won 't do anything stupid you're going to regret later on. The fact that you aren 't talking to them now doesn't mean you think they aren't there now.They might even make you feel really bad if you decide to do something dangerous or stupid, and they'll let you know. They might even tell you not to do it, if they think it'll mean you won't enjoy your time with them. Or if they think you'll do something wrong, and it might hurt them.So don't forget, just because you can't see them, there's someone out there, who's living their life in real life. A life that you are probably not experiencing at the present time, but one that you may be able to enjoy in the future.

{"id":2972,"ended":true,"length":591,"gen_text":"Your body is frozen into cryogenic sleep but for some reason your brain stays awake. 8 years later your ship arrives at the destination and the rest of the crew wakes up. your brain is in that same cryogenic sleep except your body stays awake.\n\nThe dream is the same as the nightmare but the real body keeps getting up, and that's the nightmare.\n\nThis could also explain why there is a time jump. How do you feel when time stops and when it starts again. How will you feel when what you have imagined is real. Imagine if it actually happens.\n\nA small part of being human is to always try to understand your own body and the universe. I think that part of our brain wakes up to reality, with time, the human body wakes up to reality, because we feel the world around us more than reality itself.\n\nWith the dream like brain this allows us to experience things beyond our world perspective.\n\nFor example imagine you were born with an extra eye and an extra foot. You would experience things like seeing the things you never could otherwise see.\n\nMaybe what I meant with waking up the dream and the nightmare was that not every person experiences the real world from their own perspective. Maybe some people have to live in a world where they wake up to reality.\n\nI think this also goes for dreams.\n\nMaybe there is no such thing as \"real world\" dreaming. If there is no such thing I think every person would dream the same way over and over. When people wake up the real world is always more vivid that the dream, but this happens for different reasons.\n\nIt would make the dream world less vivid because the world is constantly changing the dream world is never what it used to be.\n\nNot everyone wakes up the same way, some people have very vivid dreams but then wake up and wake up again and eventually never dream anything.\n\nIf this is true then the reason why the brain will not sleep at night during winter time is because the brain knows its only thinking about real things, and it will do anything possible to keep things in the dream world constant, because not doing so would make reality more vivid than the dream.\n\nOf course it isn't that simple. The brain is complex, you can't possibly have one simple mechanism for everything. But I think one mechanism is the brain is constantly constantly keeping the dream world constant, the world we are living in.\n\nFor many people the more vivid the world the better. So it's quite understandable that this is how some people experience it.\n\nWhen we wake up the world is almost always more vivid then when we were sleeping, and this has more to do with our brain being constant instead of fluctuating.\n\nIt all seems logical to me.\n\nWhen we wake up we can't really know what awaits us. The real life may never have happened.

{"id":3566,"ended":false,"length":525,"gen_text":"When you hit puberty, you will get taken to a customise-your character-screen where you can change anything you want. While leaving the program, you accidentally change one parameter. Now you are stuck with it.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what I needed to debug the error.\n\nHere's what I did :\n\nI loaded the file and removed the parameter.\n\nI reran the program, and entered another parameter.\n\nThen I saved it.\n\nThen after I had removed the previous parameter, I reran the computer and hit enter.\n\nHere is the error log :\n\nCode: ---- Begin debug session ---- -- System On \/ Off -- -- Core Init -- -- --- 3 core Init started --- System Initialization -- -- Core Configuration -- -- Not Available --- -- Cpu0 Cores : 3 ================================================== Loaded Configuration Files For Core : Core 0 Core 1 Core 2 Core 3 Core 4 Core 5 Core 6 Memory Usage : ================================================== % \\Users\\julian\\AppData\\Local Low\\Cordova\\Application\\Cordova\\Application.exe -> Memory : 14 Mb ================================================== ---- End debug session ----\n\nCannot access the application. You should have installed Application.exe instead of Application.dll.\n\nNow you can see that the error was caused by adding one parameter. When you do, it will set a value with the value of the parameter you add. This is why we deleted the paramater first!\n\nTo fix this problem, you could always delete the file in your app, and that will always clear any changes done in that file.\n\nSo what's left is to fix the problem in your code using a temporary file. The following will fix the problem in the error log you have so far.\n\nNote : When I typed my values, the program froze at the error log screen. I am sure that if I didn't put any value in that parameter, this error would not occur.\n\nNote2 : I tried two other programs, and both had the same issue with the parameter, so this is an extremely reliable approach. Note3 : I used a temp file because I didn't use an app.\n\nCode : ---- Begin debug session ---- -- System On \/ Off -- -- Core Init -- -- --- 3 core Init started --- System Initialization -- -- Core Configuration -- -- Not Available --- -- Cpu0 Cores : 3 ================================================== Loaded Configuration Files For Core : Core 0 Core 1 Core 2 Core 3 Core 4 Core 5 Core 6 Memory Usage : ================================================== % \\Users\\julian\\AppData\\Local Low\\Cordova\\Application\\Cordova\\Application.exe -> Memory : 14 Mb ================================================== ---- End debug session ----\n\nNow this should solve all your problems!\n\nUpdate:\n\nThe fix works flawlessly on Windows 10.

{"id":3044,"ended":true,"length":590,"gen_text":"Technology allows us to uplift dogs to human intelligence level. They are as amazing as expected. The dogs, however, are shocked to see how evil humans are.\n\nHowever, that are the true human level. But these dogs are not allowed to interact in human society. So for the dogs, this is the true 'human level'. The dog world is now a complete new life field.\n\nThe dogs understand the humans emotions, so they live inside the human heart.\n\nThese are the main reasons why most of them are living on these human planet.\n\nThe dogs are the first test subjects of new weapons technology. The more powerful weapons the dogs can carry, the higher they rise? That is why most of these dogs are the prime candidates for future test subjects of new weapon technology.\n\nMany more dogs can be created, so they can be used for many more purposes than just testing. There are many different experiments taking place and some experiments can be very dangerous to people and other dogs.\n\nFor example, a dog called 'Duke', who was a laboratory experiment for a chemical weapons testing was also a test subject for another weapon. The weapon was meant to be used on civilians, but Duke had some intelligence capability too.\n\nHe was the first test subject for the bomb test of the nuclear hydrogen bomb on the city of Hiroshima. After the test, Duke had been separated from the rest of the test group. This is the reason why Duke's corpse had a few radiation burns. Duke, however, managed to survive this deadly atomic bomb that killed almost 100,000 people and left only 600,000 people alive.\n\nThis is how the human world is controlled. The more powerful human level technology, the more aggressive dog-men will be.\n\nThis is the reason why in the dogs world people used to call 'Duke' 'The Dog Devil'. All military dogs will be dogs of the human world. People will be afraid of dogs. The only time people will be afraid of dogs is when they are going to be tested by any super technology.\n\nOn the other hand, some dogs of the other human world will be highly intelligent dogs. So many new breeds will have been created!\n\nThose dog breeders, who wish to be accepted as real dog men, will try to be one of these intelligent dog men. So they can be accepted as real dog men. On that occasion, they will do many tests to test their brains.\n\nHuman level is not enough, so dog man will also try new high level dog man techniques. Many of the best military scientists will work together to create new military dog man training programs!\n\nYou may remember how the secret space program is led by a dog man. He is a dog man (Dr. Steven Greer). He is the man who will lead the real life program, not the alien one. The alien one does nothing except watch tv, eat crack and sleep in a pod in a hole in the ground. This is the man who will lead the real life programs for people.","token_len":628,"entropy":[7.4944,1.4227,0.0485,11.3047,0.0514,8.6946,2.7809,3.4505,3.9712,4.9932,1.7265,4.7882,1.5368,5.4972,7.9337,0.2265,9.7418,1.1254,3.292,3.105,4.4703,3.3319,0.0827,0.958,9.2364,1.9105,1.0951,2.7413,8.679,0.3572,0.3224,0.5823,2.0626,0.0092,5.3812,0.0651,5.4517,7.7907,2.3802,5.7848,4.5189,5.8402,1.6272,4.5031,4.6958,1.1446,0.8576,1.9305,4.48,0.1247,3.8255,4.7826,1.1488,0.7774,0.5109,3.4392,5.8254,2.0132,2.0413,0.7223,2.7668,0.6871,1.6075,3.4014,5.8314,1.1625,0.4791,0.4932,3.2287,3.4914,3.6311,0.6719,4.4982,2.6418,4.6399,4.732,4.7888,6.2856,0.487,1.1494,0.0001,2.078,2.4732,5.9049,2.0103,3.2011,5.6156,1.6251,3.9918,0.472,5.7025,5.9594,0.9085,0.64,4.4403,0.4423,2.1749,0.0002,4.4064,2.4196,0.6149,5.0119,2.6853,0.5883,5.332,0.9903,2.4024,1.2646,4.7614,3.3322,5.7882,3.943,3.7762,0.3874,0.9722,0.0002,1.9823,1.9056,1.2281,3.135,3.1099,4.7178,1.2883,1.2377,3.5792,4.7648,1.7543,0.3672,2.412,5.9211,2.3199,1.6329,3.5093,0.9977,2.1362,4.6131,0.4785,0.0811,3.1116,3.4416,4.2681,9.1827,4.9299,0.6929,1.4435,3.4658,0.1265,2.7303,0.3111,0.6096,4.0632,6.3562,0.5409,0.3942,3.9338,3.4114,0.4275,1.7249,1.5611,2.881,0.6029,0.1105,0.3057,0.0002,4.5256,5.2251,1.5194,3.6317,0.4299,2.8147,2.3765,2.5396,2.3126,0.7274,1.0672,1.0282,1.44,3.2191,1.7997,1.8779,3.8592,0.5817,1.7578,1.0101,4.4469,0.43,0.8345,3.2264,4.1626,4.815,0.005,4.1761,3.469,2.8674,2.4649,1.037,2.7305,0.4885,2.096,4.6468,2.8084,1.9517,2.6234,0.1556,0.483,0.0002,4.0811,0.3009,0.1088,3.2765,1.3147,5.3492,2.0555,3.8046,3.0588,3.3461,1.5976,1.1508,2.5763,5.2563,3.4525,2.1218,2.0229,4.2813,2.7116,2.9013,4.084,4.8933,1.7365,1.1023,0.0763,0.5597,3.9533,3.275,1.3127,2.1914,3.4773,0.8452,5.4288,0.1942,1.6056,0.9475,0.9055,4.8778,1.1325,0.5747,2.021,3.7006,4.2191,5.1871,6.739,3.964,0.3,1.1164,0.0002,3.1743,1.2886,3.1773,0.7034,0.7989,0.0261,0.9244,1.1522,5.295,3.9924,2.2391,0.9003,3.0796,5.9723,0.045,3.2466,1.4746,3.5975,0.1165,1.1321,0.4572,4.4592,0.5847,1.822,0.2935,1.0749,3.2312,3.7203,4.4443,0.2142,0.6683,1.688,0.0541,0.0865,1.7868,2.6257,1.0834,4.5341,1.5317,1.9479,0.6703,0.1802,2.1022,3.2599,5.6875,3.1805,1.8764,4.9902,4.1677,1.5814,0.8187,2.8229,3.9135,1.3679,0.0209,4.3147,0.0098,0.8682,3.1176,3.9905,3.8062,0.4972,5.6201,2.7226,3.2056,2.2674,0.2681,0.0091,0.2469,3.1868,2.7875,4.9284,5.26,0.9685,0.0055,1.0325,0.4432,0.2243,0.411,0.0002,3.3569,0.682,3.259,1.5515,3.0345,1.5081,1.5165,3.0883,1.06,1.9053,2.9841,0.5513,4.7483,2.0641,3.1903,1.7345,0.1366,0.4506,4.9288,4.2377,3.461,3.7323,2.0386,0.6447,0.497,0.9348,0.0002,3.3347,0.3549,1.2927,1.374,0.0835,4.9249,0.9867,5.1487,0.964,4.9846,5.7496,0.1675,2.7202,2.6172,2.6705,1.3814,0.2336,1.5408,2.6146,2.8321,4.3793,0.3117,6.2178,6.6376,2.7174,3.9807,0.7719,5.7972,2.323,1.2527,0.5992,0.6457,0.611,5.4915,1.3241,1.845,2.3172,0.4104,0.9815,1.5969,3.0582,3.5099,3.9961,2.2648,0.5986,0.9738,1.8464,0.0669,0.2814,0.4985,0.3637,0.5745,0.8525,4.7853,0.1876,1.2596,2.4976,1.8379,7.0998,6.0745,3.5305,0.3654,0.5189,0.0002,5.749,0.5979,0.5773,0.0682,0.0581,4.1277,1.0534,3.4359,0.3034,3.7726,3.1362,0.8831,0.9624,0.7549,5.5757,0.4179,1.8363,0.7021,4.6268,4.0377,4.9114,3.1435,2.6246,4.1206,1.4267,0.3776,6.2248,0.6539,0.0002,5.3228,3.5547,4.2911,0.1669,2.7137,0.6041,4.6863,0.0438,2.7688,4.4806,2.4759,3.8899,1.2079,4.0666,0.3484,0.8003,4.3743,0.3439,2.6835,4.5599,0.1016,1.4639,3.1267,1.2942,0.8428,0.3618,3.849,1.2825,2.5004,1.865,2.3825,1.3551,1.1938,0.3575,0.0833,0.6824,6.1431,3.7817,4.4243,0.3706,0.7655,0.4464,4.5872,2.3883,2.8119,1.7184,2.9757,0.528,5.8156,0.8804,0.7664,0.0002,5.5563,1.2825,3.6725,2.6325,2.4863,2.4191,2.9032,4.3022,3.0101,0.9998,1.7431,1.8705,7.2527,5.2372,1.1593,2.8835,0.9732,3.3562,0.5547,5.1141,1.8908,1.2902,5.338,4.3659,4.5198,2.2293,4.1942,2.366,1.5992,0.8429,1.3223,3.4527,0.5288,0.8479,5.195,2.9066,4.0602,0.4058,0.0002,4.9131,2.8384,4.7637,3.2885,1.7849,5.836,2.8934,0.2163,2.171,5.5382,0.0373,2.0965,2.7126,0.5862,1.0193,2.2526,0.4766,1.9336,1.405,0.2967,6.3154,5.2308,0.4251,3.8737,0.0255,0.0017,0.904,1.505,0.6455,1.6173,3.5307,0.3002,3.6991,1.4162,0.475,4.6739,4.8247,3.2125,3.5114,3.722,0.8295,3.9974,3.037,0.2882,2.7476,1.863,0.882,4.2275,4.3741,2.9522,4.329,4.7706,2.286,2.1629,6.0056,4.5963,2.7081,3.1942,1.414,4.3148,3.4087,1.2812,4.209,0.7513,0.1429,0.0845,0.3069,3.9524,0.7321,1.2542,3.1701,0.4849,0.8207,0.6248,0.1894,0.3907,0.1632,3.996,3.1049,3.2159,0.8606]}
{"id":3779,"ended":true,"length":583,"gen_text":"A town that refused to allow robots to replace menial workers has become a tourist spot where one can be `` served by real a human being. ''\n\nNanuet, Long Island, just six minutes from the Atlantic Ocean, is home to Nines, a village where the only workers are the robot-wielding humans. The town's mayor, Joseph S. Giamatti, is so convinced that Nines is the future that he is encouraging people to live permanently in robotic pods that house 10 people each.\n\nThe robots themselves are made by the robot manufacturer Hanson Robotics. As we enter one of the homes, with one of the robots serving as the home's resident butler, we are told that, with a simple button, they can switch ``from being a human being to being a robot.'' One can change jobs at any time, even live out one's days without returning to a human world.\n\nThe company and the town are working with the Army, which is in the process of designing a program to have robots serve alongside humans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven so, many of the residents feel that not everyone in Nucyet can live comfortably as robots. One couple, Peter and Nancy, said they could not accept the robots because the robots did not have human emotions. (One of the only human emotions that these robotic guests have is their need to watch ``Seinfeld'' and ``Saturday Night Live'' on television.)\n\n``We got two reasons to put a robot in as opposed to a human,'' said Peter. ``The robot will come out at certain times and sit in our bedroom. The first time we saw it, we were very pleased.'' He said he would not be happier when the robot went out to do the grocery shopping, which is where the real jobs in town are located.\n\nA resident, James R. Odom, said that ``a robot will take the place of the bartender, the handyman, the gardener and the trash can collector.''\n\nOne may wonder, if you have spent nearly half an hour observing the robots at their various tasks over the course of a month, why the town decided to create them. In a town with only 2,000 households and a population of 1,000, one can understand why a handful of people thought they could turn a profit by attracting people living in other countries, the world's poor and the elderly to live in Nines -- even though none of those people live in the village.\n\nStill, few would argue that it is better to make money by selling things to individuals.\n\nThe robots were introduced earlier this year and so far, the townspeople are pleased with them. Nines has a kitchen, a bathroom and a television. (It also has a couple of televisions on which ''Seinfeld'' and ``Saturday Night Live'' are being taped.) The robots, however, cannot be hired by local residents and must be rented from Hanson Robotics. The town's budget of $2.5 million for 2008 is spent on their upkeep.","token_len":628,"entropy":[8.77,3.3287,7.0415,0.0735,3.9096,9.831,0.7324,4.5733,5.1399,2.5976,3.3185,2.4182,2.5929,0.8466,5.3666,4.6506,4.3098,5.9338,1.1726,4.3231,12.7896,13.2038,1.6154,7.1863,8.739,4.6092,0.5744,2.7156,3.9165,1.5312,0.0209,5.7259,5.1519,1.0495,0.501,3.7251,0.0022,0.2305,4.9555,6.2764,5.5212,0.634,1.2922,4.178,0.204,0.193,1.0854,2.1719,0.0368,5.51,6.0062,0.6538,0.5337,5.5584,1.7452,2.4048,3.4079,4.5954,0.3592,3.2078,2.8536,2.3005,4.4118,0.0526,4.4875,0.7376,2.6427,2.305,1.7943,2.1935,0.2793,3.7691,4.1864,2.3146,4.0166,2.2214,2.5791,0.2188,2.5484,3.1711,2.5182,0.5485,2.6026,0.0383,1.1436,1.1856,0.7705,0.6329,0.1297,2.2342,5.0887,2.2372,0.1264,3.4582,5.3383,0.5497,4.074,1.8384,2.7896,4.1136,3.7037,0.9976,1.0393,0.26,0.2548,0.0003,2.0809,2.518,4.7221,0.8087,2.8856,0.3507,2.7217,3.5799,2.6628,3.6385,0.0433,1.258,4.9503,5.1961,4.1855,2.5792,0.3576,0.358,5.2393,0.3728,5.9187,4.8764,0.8627,0.3779,1.4782,4.0129,0.4025,1.5541,5.247,0.493,2.4329,5.912,0.0007,0.0974,1.694,1.2391,2.8011,0.496,4.1401,3.8548,2.4772,4.3133,3.4876,1.9302,3.3306,0.1881,4.7723,5.9138,1.9657,2.083,0.8262,2.0877,0.9902,0.1137,0.4737,0.2438,0.5981,0.5304,5.1378,1.9871,4.8331,4.6087,1.7198,1.3996,0.0905,0.9412,3.7086,5.958,2.561,1.7144,0.0247,2.0939,4.3896,5.4691,0.2025,2.3768,0.6638,2.4833,0.1924,0.3151,0.0003,1.8874,4.6624,5.7035,1.1561,0.4702,1.3064,4.6372,2.7164,0.8585,4.3994,2.4598,1.111,1.0379,4.1361,0.1479,0.3329,0.0017,3.9325,0.9624,3.9156,0.7278,3.8268,1.9503,2.5356,4.0784,2.3299,1.5554,1.4776,0.0002,3.9678,0.0058,0.0002,0.0005,0.0001,0.0002,0.0008,0.0004,5.4209,2.8526,0.0117,3.459,2.4362,0.6495,1.7621,5.2304,1.0759,6.4323,1.285,2.7064,6.0796,5.7716,2.4002,3.032,2.3112,4.7247,3.2004,1.4253,0.2319,2.6798,4.6755,0.8446,5.6047,0.3456,4.3753,2.9835,3.0206,0.7888,3.2276,0.4313,3.4026,1.5082,3.2372,1.6973,3.245,3.01,2.6703,0.0383,1.3447,2.7272,0.6294,0.4888,5.4261,3.8823,0.921,0.2243,6.2773,1.4077,1.0878,1.6855,4.6603,4.7137,4.8578,1.5217,0.3971,4.6729,2.8339,0.3573,5.2719,3.7271,4.2803,0.0037,0.3604,1.7827,1.1638,3.6711,0.0011,0.0058,0.3359,1.6196,1.1452,0.3063,0.2629,0.0003,3.8366,1.3557,5.8759,5.4711,5.4417,1.6627,5.1365,2.32,0.4767,0.2473,7.8987,2.0283,0.0018,0.5771,0.5199,1.2349,1.1548,0.8592,1.1032,0.3191,2.1222,1.5033,2.474,4.7986,2.9796,3.0913,3.8936,0.1783,1.4867,4.512,1.7971,2.3668,3.6861,1.3169,1.693,4.9858,1.3776,1.5838,2.1532,1.3054,0.4298,0.4353,1.4939,2.7071,3.3863,3.5649,4.232,1.3735,1.1473,2.2205,1.5872,1.8715,5.6297,3.8655,0.5563,0.2066,3.5373,1.526,1.6483,2.5293,2.3377,4.2792,0.1187,2.3317,3.3954,1.7968,3.5002,1.3546,2.1892,3.2611,2.4575,2.5431,0.5905,2.5808,0.0519,0.1959,0.0003,3.874,3.9841,2.1757,5.0078,4.0232,0.3324,4.7223,5.2114,0.055,1.2415,1.3185,5.2883,3.7541,0.9047,2.678,3.3505,2.356,1.1177,0.0207,2.3434,4.818,1.2886,0.5513,4.4532,0.0495,0.3566,0.1444,3.2777,0.0016,1.8795,0.4706,4.7344,5.5723,1.849,1.0495,0.9051,0.0002,3.8734,6.3897,1.6467,2.5085,3.276,4.5285,2.1804,4.2863,5.6265,3.0451,1.7336,0.0071,4.8958,0.9112,2.4321,2.7264,4.8099,2.8434,1.0809,5.4978,0.2389,2.1035,0.0022,1.1498,3.8891,0.1432,1.528,2.1459,1.456,3.6527,0.2253,3.5936,2.2927,0.919,3.8356,1.8238,1.7916,2.2867,2.2655,3.3916,0.0719,0.6683,6.524,2.1318,1.6226,0.8193,0.1176,2.5579,0.0025,2.307,0.1325,4.1141,2.3543,1.768,1.1576,2.1394,4.5628,0.0672,1.7825,4.5189,2.7736,0.7087,4.471,1.3889,1.2973,0.6923,5.2306,2.4158,5.2847,0.5174,2.2991,3.2728,3.0556,5.0127,3.2467,2.3816,4.14,0.6697,1.2426,1.9218,2.1898,0.9572,0.5306,2.2273,0.1253,5.3626,3.6196,1.4644,4.8455,0.1124,1.4294,0.7962,4.5489,0.642,0.8922,1.6068,0.3091,0.3416,0.0003,5.2335,0.0417,6.1257,2.3467,1.2286,0.2342,3.557,0.4014,2.8468,0.3402,4.5447,1.427,0.9987,2.4215,4.1305,1.3782,7.1043,3.4262,2.2731,0.0002,2.076,2.287,3.5298,3.7922,6.0631,0.0322,0.2681,1.903,4.6505,0.0402,1.7781,2.0501,0.9174,6.6714,0.0002,1.7824,2.1358,0.6466,1.1026,0.1674,5.1761,0.0549,1.6246,2.7162,4.9667,0.9776,0.7517,2.0268,0.8689,0.5437,3.0539,1.2993,4.9507,3.104,2.0879,0.2236,0.3881,5.6435,0.0334,4.6435,0.0009,2.8162,1.2356,5.8591,1.8419,0.0084,0.0515,0.8887,0.3838,0.3459,0.0023,0.0052,0.0214,0.314,1.5015,3.296,0.4092,1.863,1.6004,2.988,1.9949,0.0043,4.5147,3.0392,5.2973,1.8648,5.3432,0.7669,2.8256,1.8897,0.304,2.3621,2.2283,0.694,0.6483,0.4085,2.2274,1.6215,2.3241,4.4506,3.2559,0.2308,2.8452,1.1195,1.019,0.0047,1.2925,6.6941,1.0738,4.091,0.3494,5.6166,1.5523,0.6077]}
{"id":319,"ended":true,"length":591,"gen_text":"Your body is frozen into cryogenic sleep but for some reason your brain stays awake. 8 years later your ship arrives at the destination and the rest of the crew wakes up. your brain is in that same cryogenic sleep except your body stays awake.\n\nThe dream is the same as the nightmare but the real body keeps getting up, and that's the nightmare.\n\nThis could also explain why there is a time jump. How do you feel when time stops and when it starts again. How will you feel when what you have imagined is real. Imagine if it actually happens.\n\nA small part of being human is to always try to understand your own body and the universe. I think that part of our brain wakes up to reality, with time, the human body wakes up to reality, because we feel the world around us more than reality itself.\n\nWith the dream like brain this allows us to experience things beyond our world perspective.\n\nFor example imagine you were born with an extra eye and an extra foot. You would experience things like seeing the things you never could otherwise see.\n\nMaybe what I meant with waking up the dream and the nightmare was that not every person experiences the real world from their own perspective. Maybe some people have to live in a world where they wake up to reality.\n\nI think this also goes for dreams.\n\nMaybe there is no such thing as \"real world\" dreaming. If there is no such thing I think every person would dream the same way over and over. When people wake up the real world is always more vivid that the dream, but this happens for different reasons.\n\nIt would make the dream world less vivid because the world is constantly changing the dream world is never what it used to be.\n\nNot everyone wakes up the same way, some people have very vivid dreams but then wake up and wake up again and eventually never dream anything.\n\nIf this is true then the reason why the brain will not sleep at night during winter time is because the brain knows its only thinking about real things, and it will do anything possible to keep things in the dream world constant, because not doing so would make reality more vivid than the dream.\n\nOf course it isn't that simple. The brain is complex, you can't possibly have one simple mechanism for everything. But I think one mechanism is the brain is constantly constantly keeping the dream world constant, the world we are living in.\n\nFor many people the more vivid the world the better. So it's quite understandable that this is how some people experience it.\n\nWhen we wake up the world is almost always more vivid then when we were sleeping, and this has more to do with our brain being constant instead of fluctuating.\n\nIt all seems logical to me.\n\nWhen we wake up we can't really know what awaits us. The real life may never have happened. Our brain is constantly waking the dream world up to reality and allowing us to experience it like no other.\n\nFor me, when I realized this I was sad.","token_len":628,"entropy":[4.5454,1.3802,9.5608,5.5405,8.4426,0.9073,1.3084,5.8261,6.1326,2.1025,0.1246,1.6908,2.0142,5.4731,0.4346,0.6767,10.499,4.4544,1.2487,2.0566,6.4911,3.9704,0.906,1.4573,4.1818,1.7227,2.8256,4.5374,0.7404,0.8085,0.3247,2.8779,0.8462,0.8052,7.7117,1.9876,0.801,3.5128,5.3668,2.2508,1.9209,0.4475,0.1208,6.0167,2.0642,0.6928,6.4464,0.2232,0.4604,2.5249,0.0239,2.8046,5.3985,1.8644,2.646,1.8114,1.1974,0.9555,4.0732,1.9729,1.5361,4.9687,4.5209,5.3215,4.684,0.6545,3.1588,2.495,3.853,0.9364,1.626,3.4511,0.3571,0.7403,0.0001,2.9329,4.4962,2.4854,2.3827,0.8151,3.9599,1.3332,1.2933,4.3687,2.7264,2.1877,5.7853,1.8359,0.4174,4.5921,1.2774,4.3562,3.6255,2.0354,4.9703,0.8645,0.3042,0.3598,3.1956,3.7169,5.3679,0.4767,0.5799,0.8094,7.0158,0.6934,3.7219,4.9307,1.7658,1.4024,1.1551,5.4884,2.9883,3.2461,5.0743,2.485,0.9313,1.0372,0.0001,4.5368,5.6412,2.8867,0.0344,7.0307,1.5338,0.2196,2.4031,5.07,3.4054,0.3437,2.5344,4.0239,1.3583,3.3432,1.3385,2.1279,2.975,1.218,3.4372,1.8024,1.8047,4.0471,0.5138,2.4873,1.6821,4.5276,0.0598,3.2848,2.3128,3.2731,6.417,3.4538,1.6449,4.5968,4.4935,1.3086,2.5041,0.0146,0.574,0.2617,1.7833,4.7543,1.8324,4.1565,1.8843,2.8256,1.0894,0.0243,4.7356,1.8264,4.8471,0.7067,0.1853,0.8732,0.0002,5.8808,2.0378,3.2248,5.237,4.821,5.1632,4.8602,0.6993,0.0621,2.5509,2.4238,4.5653,0.7672,4.3662,6.5922,0.5475,1.6937,0.0002,4.0605,0.5138,2.8442,1.6637,2.9876,4.5742,2.5998,3.3598,1.936,2.0803,2.9045,3.8051,0.219,5.5744,0.5494,1.8436,2.1636,3.2984,2.0734,2.1005,3.0775,1.6576,6.0358,1.5738,2.4429,1.4401,4.4713,2.003,0.6636,1.43,0.0002,4.9193,4.8135,2.1254,5.6921,2.7597,4.733,0.1141,2.4307,1.5904,3.9602,1.2765,0.8782,1.4243,1.0148,5.8468,3.582,3.057,2.3206,1.0149,4.6743,0.1923,3.9076,1.5022,1.143,0.3277,0.337,2.1877,2.7876,0.5012,2.3293,2.8848,3.2093,0.6766,1.1522,1.9814,1.6731,1.3007,5.1326,0.0242,1.3728,0.8675,1.573,0.7147,0.0002,2.375,1.353,1.6722,3.5125,3.9639,0.5427,2.9908,0.7944,2.3008,0.0001,3.0409,3.4521,0.6558,3.0908,2.0635,0.0515,0.0286,3.2752,1.6687,2.563,0.5378,5.2293,0.5778,3.8753,2.5217,0.4276,1.5173,0.8396,0.0228,3.9736,0.8751,5.1563,1.1003,3.476,2.4727,1.7393,0.2607,1.2485,6.6318,0.0725,0.001,1.347,5.3635,3.8182,1.4946,0.0622,3.0127,2.3423,0.032,2.4142,3.3018,3.9848,2.1976,5.1216,1.2857,0.4315,2.771,1.9276,4.3742,4.5678,3.0174,3.0696,0.1953,0.2843,0.6175,0.0002,3.6207,3.4989,2.5241,3.6999,1.7123,3.4268,2.6927,1.4982,2.4431,2.0292,3.111,1.2251,3.1079,0.3884,5.9503,1.4435,1.2945,1.3071,3.8239,6.215,0.4682,1.5652,0.0053,0.0112,0.2749,0.6517,0.0001,5.9809,1.8317,2.1345,0.0121,2.2065,0.1874,0.7064,1.6808,2.2284,0.4933,2.3005,4.5149,0.9339,0.1853,2.3854,3.7387,2.3646,0.02,2.1017,4.3941,0.1327,1.1949,2.4661,5.4254,3.7269,1.9426,4.1043,1.9478,0.8499,0.0001,3.4933,2.4863,0.3692,0.5548,0.9604,2.1771,3.7634,1.2618,2.5669,3.4778,5.1635,2.874,3.6174,4.4528,1.1318,6.3633,4.2393,2.7596,0.5293,0.3168,1.1953,0.6126,4.431,4.0687,4.3242,5.2182,0.1941,4.6067,1.0481,2.022,1.6668,2.2947,2.765,4.9132,1.2186,3.994,0.1084,1.9194,5.1256,2.3625,1.4018,0.9866,0.565,4.7042,2.6507,2.4536,6.4747,3.2987,0.8973,0.9303,2.1612,4.0258,2.2603,0.9557,2.73,0.499,0.0457,0.2775,0.2518,0.0002,5.4318,0.0265,2.9948,4.9001,0.0008,2.2267,0.3365,0.9778,2.4226,0.5221,1.5195,4.375,2.0936,4.4985,0.8152,0.4996,5.8198,3.3994,1.8066,1.8874,2.9638,1.8135,0.9518,0.3825,2.4084,1.7477,0.1706,5.1671,3.3502,1.1108,2.1025,2.4567,2.7091,1.9053,5.1225,5.3355,1.9704,0.5318,0.2111,0.3067,1.5513,3.9274,4.3227,3.217,2.3456,2.2037,0.0608,1.2379,0.4836,0.0001,4.0784,5.0627,0.5533,1.4561,5.704,1.2469,0.6459,2.3425,1.5944,1.178,0.9716,3.689,2.9753,2.1724,5.1359,3.9028,1.083,3.8178,1.3815,1.7682,4.3276,0.0852,1.9648,3.625,0.2312,0.5272,0.0002,4.0615,2.0693,1.4888,0.0454,1.1718,1.5087,0.8927,5.6131,0.3365,0.6259,0.1547,3.641,2.8903,0.0281,1.6126,0.7732,1.5315,1.7273,1.6328,3.9961,5.0891,0.0609,0.0051,0.0317,1.6508,1.4714,2.693,5.5261,5.5676,0.0254,2.987,0.0022,0.8583,0.4032,0.0002,3.1375,5.2882,2.9369,3.6823,1.5936,0.0232,1.1682,1.1288,0.0001,3.9894,1.1585,0.9769,0.0305,1.6686,3.4501,1.6986,3.1747,3.725,0.9029,7.0176,0.0307,1.3759,2.8098,3.7954,5.0673,4.5806,4.38,3.9142,0.6116,1.1594,3.9713,1.8047,1.7104,1.7662,3.6944,4.6458,0.4111,0.8428,0.2326,1.5932,0.5501,2.3042,5.4406,0.5921,0.0588,0.5169,2.0419,4.566,4.1509,0.3345,0.9036,0.3779,0.0001,4.0725,1.4428,2.5249,3.2728,0.1956,6.1876,0.7635,0.8142,2.1435,4.6517,0.7225]}
{"id":4907,"ended":true,"length":597,"gen_text":"You amounted to nothing much and eventually die and go to the afterlife. Instead of finding other people, you find all the versions of yourself you could have potentially become.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what you were searching for. The other selves you had made in other scenarios would all have been different, and those different versions of you would have had different experiences than you did, but you would have remembered them anyway.\n\nThat's what makes it feel real. The experiences.\n\nIt is a very odd experience to be living through multiple lifetimes simultaneously, but you're in your body, you have a bunch of memories from other life scenarios, you're a human being, you're on Earth for at least a good 30,000 years. A normal human brain can process one or two of these memories before it forgets everything else. So the average person probably goes through about 6 or 7 different lifetimes during their lifetime.\n\nWhat it feels like is what we call multiple personalities, and there's a very big difference between a single personality and multiple personalities. The single personality only has a single experience, the other personalities can each have their own experience, so not every personality experiences the same thing. There are about a dozen different personalities ( you might be a different guy, the exact same one, or different versions of the same guy ), and they are all unique.\n\nYou do have to remember that we were not the first people to discover multiple personalities, and we certainly weren't the first to research this stuff. It was discovered by Russian scientists in the past century that people had multiple personalities, and many different groups around the world have examined multiple personalities using a large variety of methods, including experiments, sensory deprivation, brain scan technology, and more. So this is certainly not an uncharted territory.\n\nAnyway, the idea was that your psyche, your self-image is actually just an extremely complicated collection of different experiences stored separately under the covers of your mind. They were called the'subselves' ( this is where'self' actually comes from ).\n\nThe idea was that these subselves have their own personality, their own motivations, their own thoughts, their own preferences, and many different versions of themselves. This isn't what you think about yourself as you're waking up in the morning. It's just what is in your subconscious mind. If you had a million years to just go on doing whatever you want to do, to think about anything you want to think of, it would be exactly the same every, single, time. You wouldn't see anything new happen to your mind. You would become almost identical to everyone else.

{"id":4774,"ended":false,"length":590,"gen_text":"A story which tells a first person account of how that character died, usually in one of its own comic book stories.[4] The story may be told in any medium; film, television, video games,[5] comics, short stories, stage plays, or books. The following is an example of a story within a comic.[6][7] [8] The story can also go in any direction based on plot or themes; for instance, if it involves a character suffering or trying to escape the pressures of a society with few options, then the ending of the story could have a happy or tragic conclusion.[9]\n\nContents show]\n\nExamples of Death in stories Edit\n\nThe following examples depict a particular character trying to overcome a particular hurdle in order to live out their life, often in its natural environment, but sometimes from a foreign and often untenable location. As part of their solution, they often die, thereby revealing who they are as a person.\n\nNon-fiction Death stories Edit\n\nExamples of non-fiction Death stories are often not as tragic as those presented by comics, as the reader is shown that the protagonist was not given a way out of the situation through the characters failure, however, it may still be painful to the reader.\n\nComics Death stories Edit\n\nExamples of comic book Death stories are usually more tragic and realistic due to the comic book medium itself.\n\nAnime Death stories Edit\n\nAnime Death stories tend to involve the main character's death at least in one of their final fights with an opposing force. The anime may also include the death of one of their friends and their friends in return, but with an alternative ending than a typical Death Story in the form of a sequel. Unlike comic books Death stories do not always involve the final confrontation; typically, Death Stories typically involve an unplanned death by accident, or the protagonist attempting to live their life one day at a time. Sometimes the Death Story is related to the main character using an object such as a car, or a sword, to try and survive a particular scenario; where the goal of the Death Story is to live.\n\nVideo games Death stories Edit\n\nVideo games Death Stories generally focus on the death of one or several characters. Unlike cartoons or films, Death Stories do not often involve the final confrontation; however, there is a tradition of the first death to be shown taking place outside of the final confrontation, usually in some unusual new location or situation. Video games Death Stories tend to rely almost entirely on player imagination as to how the death occurred, and more often than not the player plays the role of the character.\n\nAudio Comics Death stories Edit\n\nAudio Comics also have a tradition of Death Stories, and generally involve characters dying in real life. A few examples of Audio Comics Death stories include the death of the main characters at the same time in a way no comic could have done.\n\nTrivia Edit\n\nDeath stories may be an in-joke about the idea of time passing at different rates for different people.\n\nSee also Edit","token_len":629,"entropy":[7.2494,5.5148,5.1441,2.8471,7.7142,1.2133,2.0286,0.2073,3.1755,6.0118,5.7593,4.8133,1.7889,4.541,1.6864,4.3986,0.1834,4.2186,3.3394,4.6496,1.858,1.848,5.055,3.1129,0.1954,2.852,3.0251,1.7411,1.2466,1.9016,1.1707,2.7233,0.5288,3.7586,5.143,0.0713,0.4733,0.0923,1.5174,0.1495,6.497,0.3469,0.1304,3.1234,0.1635,5.7753,0.2634,0.1692,5.7869,0.1709,0.2174,1.9589,5.141,0.5502,2.0437,5.6331,1.8713,1.3406,0.4333,0.2341,0.3262,2.969,5.3664,0.4903,1.1327,4.5417,0.1907,2.5046,0.0635,0.199,6.5352,0.195,0.1211,3.1937,2.6962,2.8915,1.7954,6.4661,1.864,1.3206,0.9521,6.1377,0.0575,5.4374,2.3352,5.1589,2.7632,2.4661,1.9679,0.1046,3.4319,2.6757,2.682,1.0362,2.129,5.3534,3.7661,3.6077,0.0253,1.8892,3.3232,4.6576,0.1799,1.8864,3.4784,4.6104,4.8674,2.1384,0.5529,2.0705,1.0606,5.5459,3.1913,0.2323,0.0858,2.5068,3.5771,1.1391,1.3518,1.8722,1.1831,1.6139,1.2282,0.3133,0.1841,0.725,0.0003,3.7694,0.0429,0.0002,0.012,0.0002,2.3653,1.2956,2.3493,1.145,3.4072,0.6529,0.0091,0.0002,2.2983,1.8178,2.8497,4.6728,3.0635,4.3259,1.2273,6.2064,0.0546,3.2518,1.8768,2.5911,5.8761,2.0241,1.0816,0.0113,2.2561,3.7494,1.3771,0.7543,2.345,2.3402,1.5338,6.7275,4.0476,2.6535,1.6923,2.2219,0.7844,5.0362,1.5034,4.7747,4.2258,3.3091,4.6717,2.4064,1.3096,0.5174,5.1412,5.7747,0.0019,1.5454,5.713,0.2561,1.1481,2.2946,2.0805,2.0654,6.3952,4.6317,5.1969,0.4733,0.6978,2.3423,0.3994,0.2816,0.7953,0.4965,0.0002,4.8841,0.2069,1.634,3.3237,2.0965,0.1375,0.0142,0.0002,4.2962,0.2296,0.5738,0.0491,0.0152,0.785,0.0787,2.0694,3.0533,5.1904,2.6488,3.6043,0.8578,1.8049,3.4211,3.5452,3.1328,1.1472,2.8029,1.7592,2.9412,1.1691,5.4694,2.145,0.6911,2.7489,3.2122,1.2704,4.7251,0.9941,3.7287,0.4137,1.4618,0.9439,0.4083,5.4171,2.0924,5.4745,6.5986,1.5763,4.9548,1.031,2.586,2.0344,0.7775,1.0449,4.8663,1.0991,1.3762,0.1948,1.3656,1.0036,0.0002,3.1258,1.3407,1.1823,0.3086,0.0299,0.031,0.0002,2.1814,0.0187,2.1102,0.6021,0.1153,0.0944,0.6079,2.0917,1.844,1.5182,1.8949,3.9643,5.447,0.0166,0.2874,4.1487,0.8297,1.4784,3.6459,1.142,1.2734,0.0002,4.8926,0.3205,0.1004,0.0248,0.0045,0.0239,0.0002,1.7852,0.0075,0.251,0.045,3.5456,0.0198,3.6167,1.9019,3.2987,0.3363,2.5432,0.6357,2.5124,4.7034,2.4471,1.6849,0.7881,1.4926,4.2685,4.1234,2.5186,2.3906,3.7683,1.7107,0.9324,2.7218,2.9634,2.2659,1.1503,1.9592,1.9011,1.3982,0.0579,2.6782,0.4133,1.4361,1.5116,2.4182,4.7247,1.7755,3.4705,2.8606,1.4794,3.7946,4.731,3.7317,3.7403,1.1818,4.9428,3.7329,3.5022,1.766,1.5945,3.452,1.8788,3.0218,0.0157,0.4722,3.9142,0.9114,6.5969,2.0817,0.4738,2.8503,1.0526,3.2401,0.0667,1.9125,1.4274,1.0146,5.3544,2.5112,3.8518,6.3537,1.3072,3.3768,0.8463,6.1283,1.2774,3.5855,5.4263,1.6218,1.6775,3.5202,1.6795,1.4513,2.0934,2.2,2.3669,4.5171,0.1772,3.6289,1.9677,0.2922,4.7495,1.8243,0.2084,0.0076,0.0026,0.9389,4.95,1.6708,2.8807,0.5562,1.577,4.4957,0.052,0.7675,1.7808,0.6633,7.3654,3.317,2.7869,4.2945,0.0097,0.248,4.9705,1.5093,2.0593,1.4193,3.7323,1.0869,1.8721,3.4572,0.692,3.2986,1.9163,3.0637,4.1589,3.3702,5.4487,0.9619,5.8958,1.1708,0.2087,1.3271,0.0574,0.204,0.4781,3.0731,3.7516,0.5325,0.0002,2.4984,0.8772,0.1077,0.0512,0.0099,0.0186,0.0002,1.1212,0.4077,0.4561,1.4965,3.4382,3.2273,0.1486,0.4922,1.8234,0.0536,1.8458,1.8325,2.8842,0.6522,2.2381,4.2966,6.504,1.7994,2.6568,0.3071,2.022,0.1083,2.211,0.0224,3.2969,1.1722,0.7772,1.2642,0.4889,1.5714,3.2344,0.0576,3.7054,2.1911,1.3461,5.4015,0.3926,2.6135,5.1654,3.0712,3.096,0.6792,3.7164,6.6778,0.0226,3.8283,0.3765,0.5384,2.3419,1.4733,1.5647,2.7215,1.6117,3.3649,4.4223,6.9041,0.6635,2.4503,2.5392,0.3864,3.6776,0.2745,0.8312,0.0742,2.2194,0.0358,6.4611,5.6279,0.7491,0.0527,3.5268,3.1849,3.3108,0.445,1.4911,0.4848,2.2662,2.1868,0.845,1.4339,5.6848,0.4365,0.0503,0.0074,1.7508,1.1792,5.5274,1.0402,0.6595,0.0302,0.3852,1.5003,2.233,0.9534,0.0002,5.2455,4.175,0.0647,0.0957,0.0042,0.0221,0.0002,0.3897,0.7971,5.8838,2.1195,1.7819,0.6869,0.0408,0.3193,0.102,0.9506,3.0247,4.2307,1.707,3.0229,1.432,1.3363,5.1652,0.3891,1.0767,4.6659,3.2582,1.7968,1.2791,2.1663,0.2087,0.1325,1.8477,0.947,2.3977,2.4688,0.0253,2.0116,0.7512,2.6453,2.9831,0.1088,6.1333,0.0474,2.363,1.813,5.8751,5.8649,3.0647,2.0839,2.3091,1.6354,1.8538,0.7225,0.0002,3.278,0.0059,0.15,0.0002,2.3546,1.1422,3.2482,0.9646,3.8976,4.4384,0.3472,0.0488,0.0003,4.3336,1.0477,4.4259,0.4026,6.0808,1.7789,4.8424,2.7048,0.3494,1.8983,0.347,0.9788,0.6634,1.1983,0.0001,2.4242,0.0899,0.0879]}
{"id":4623,"ended":true,"length":503,"gen_text":"`` Now I am become death. Destroyer of worlds. ''\n\n'''\n\n\nThis is the story of the creation of the\n\n'universe' and all its things. It should never be\n\nre-told in public, not even among family and\n\nfriends. It is the secret of our history; its\n\nfathomless depth is beyond all\n\nwords.\n\n\nIt was early one morning at the Great Table,\n\nwhere four giants of myth gathered together\n\nto rule the universe, with one god to look after their\n\ndominion. The gods sat in a circle, with a giant\n\nlooking through an opening in the center at the\n\ngods across the table.\n\n\nThe gods spoke in a whisper as the giant\n\nwaited:\n\n\n\"'Gods,' the giant said, 'let it be so.'\n\n'Universe,' said one god, 'let it be so.'\n\n'World,' said another, 'let it be so.'\n\nThey all spoke as if one had a magic button\n\nto push and lock everything at will.\n\n\n'''\n\n\nThe universe came into being in the midst of their\n\ntalks, and now there is no end to it. At the\n\nbeginning there was nothing: no planet, no moon; there\n\nwas nothing in the world but stars. The stars are\n\nthe stars -- that is all.\n\n\n'''Now, my brothers,' said the giant, 'why\n\nshould you trouble yourselves about the stars?\n\nThey are only so much dirt in this great wheel\n\nof my invention; they rot and burn and fade,\n\nand when they are gone, the wheel may remain.'\n\n\n'''The stars' was the reply, and everyone\n\nwoke. The giants were gone; the wheel was\n\nalive, and the universe still continues, for we\n\nare living in the last days, in the age of the\n\nworlds, the age of the gods, the epoch of the\n\nuniverse. Let us not worry, my brothers. We\n\nare here, and never shall be away from the\n\nuniverse. Remember that we are gods,\n\nand that our lives are only a moment of the\n\nuniverse.

However there is one thing here we have to agree about, you have some of the key elements.\n\nI will go alone while you go alone with him.\n\nIf we cant agree then I will not kill you.\n\nWe will go our separate ways but I guarantee your safety. \"\n\n\nHe agreed to this plan and then they set out together.\n\nTwo minutes later, the other guy came back with tears in his eyes.\n\nThen he found out that his friend had gone into the forest alone.\n\nAnd that the reason he had gone into the forest was just to avoid this suicide.\n\nSo he got back in his car and drove off.\n\nHe went home happy the night had ended.\n\nBut in the morning, I heard him on his own.\n\n\nMy thoughts at the time were :\n\n\" what a dick! So many emotions at the same time! He had to go through so many different emotions just to resolve a small issue with his girlfriend. \"\n\n\nBut one thing kept on bothering me : why?\n\nHow will he be able to have any sort of control over his own body when one of his fingers is already broken and the next one will have a broken bone?\n\n\nLater, I came across a video on youtube. He said he had found this video while looking for the first video. On another post there was a comment on the video where one of the guys said I thought he died, the first guy replied \" I knew you would.\n\nDo you think I wouldnt have been angry about someone taking your last precious things?\".\n\nThen they found that there are two things that they can do to escape :\n\n\n1.\n\nYou can hit the other one until he dies.\n\nHe also tried this and it worked pretty well\n\n\n2.\n\nOr\n\nYou can try breaking his bones.\n\nThere are several videos that shows this.\n\n\nIn a way, they are really in the same position, since no matter what he has done he cannot escape death.","token_len":631,"entropy":[4.748,6.2027,0.7447,1.0444,6.3213,1.5665,4.0845,1.5233,1.5751,4.5559,5.2047,3.7787,5.4847,12.6472,2.5053,1.169,0.7136,4.5181,2.4321,1.13,0.0194,0.4622,3.5904,5.8757,0.3145,3.6426,0.0128,4.9127,0.0429,5.9942,3.1045,1.8256,4.4284,1.067,1.7273,0.012,5.9175,0.3579,4.4094,5.8898,4.8145,0.9605,4.5813,5.9475,2.628,1.436,5.1772,0.7838,1.3111,3.2467,1.9464,4.6884,2.8604,0.372,2.7653,0.066,4.9337,3.8628,0.0475,1.9271,0.4961,0.256,2.2907,0.3626,0.6327,0.0001,3.2213,2.8327,2.6194,5.03,2.3195,0.4756,0.0001,3.707,8.0357,3.6657,2.5637,4.8814,0.4035,1.1579,2.3205,0.2816,1.5783,2.9173,0.0002,2.0994,0.7186,2.8408,5.0847,2.1146,5.3949,3.2448,0.1024,1.1215,0.5992,0.2709,0.0002,4.1054,5.0476,6.0674,4.9055,3.1297,2.2158,3.2166,5.1213,2.0092,0.332,1.8317,2.9768,4.1556,1.3262,2.5113,3.04,4.4632,1.9046,0.7297,2.1628,6.7998,3.9246,3.4809,2.4767,0.8653,2.6011,2.9313,0.0002,3.3646,2.4348,1.6347,5.296,0.4356,0.4799,2.0518,1.2958,0.8643,0.3415,0.0001,2.1761,3.0534,4.353,2.8745,0.5768,2.9588,3.4088,3.898,2.4431,4.2966,0.0752,0.0029,3.9353,0.1362,0.0001,3.494,2.7892,0.3433,0.4747,2.0942,2.0213,0.4034,0.0002,0.045,5.7442,4.0882,2.3307,1.6777,1.8521,2.5515,2.4941,0.8407,2.5364,2.8401,1.2728,1.4006,2.9783,4.0018,0.9189,0.7109,0.0492,1.0512,5.371,3.3466,0.091,3.4603,2.2808,0.803,5.4952,3.6322,2.625,3.1889,2.5594,0.2992,1.3047,0.1947,2.2424,1.8996,1.8034,0.6155,2.7741,2.0662,0.3349,1.4844,1.5422,0.4366,6.8316,5.4778,0.7403,1.2102,0.9752,6.263,4.6159,2.0565,0.1412,1.7983,3.7658,1.7275,2.3072,2.2138,7.5405,4.0235,1.4315,4.4792,3.1915,3.8185,0.8684,0.0002,2.6253,0.8502,2.1962,3.3444,4.1516,0.2129,0.7973,2.5829,1.3677,1.454,0.6302,0.4046,0.0002,2.0912,2.2137,4.4219,1.7388,1.1911,1.4414,0.1726,4.2754,1.666,1.8281,1.6361,0.6935,0.0002,3.7676,0.7904,2.0822,4.7798,0.5872,0.0145,2.9514,1.9196,6.0674,4.761,0.891,0.9005,0.658,0.7244,0.0002,3.2734,2.4345,1.9639,1.718,3.0428,1.3455,2.5775,1.1342,4.7362,1.1998,1.7362,0.4343,0.2012,0.0001,6.276,4.6849,0.2968,1.7309,1.693,1.1849,0.1888,1.2195,1.3908,2.1545,5.8959,0.2621,0.0138,0.0166,0.8262,0.1,0.0002,3.0928,0.4628,5.5628,0.4308,0.696,1.4896,1.4952,1.1476,2.8988,2.5114,0.1864,0.7076,0.8578,0.8226,0.1524,0.0001,2.9962,2.5697,3.1168,3.2145,1.3805,1.7278,0.879,1.8888,0.0736,0.1114,0.9876,4.5324,0.3536,4.768,3.3867,4.8675,1.0327,0.1683,0.0001,1.4754,0.3859,4.1522,3.2523,1.6466,0.8539,0.1993,0.2073,1.3917,1.9943,0.7235,0.2716,0.0001,2.0347,3.0592,2.3842,6.4807,6.6162,2.4025,1.5921,1.0204,1.2608,0.3435,0.0002,1.6621,3.257,0.0832,0.0374,1.1884,6.8384,2.5747,1.8184,3.5835,2.6139,4.4897,1.9614,2.5436,0.0002,4.9449,4.2383,4.0419,0.8209,0.3073,0.8709,4.2069,0.4808,0.0002,1.6097,5.9199,1.1756,4.869,2.9352,6.4423,4.8505,4.4182,3.6279,1.9463,0.3003,0.0163,1.4796,2.7751,3.2799,1.6396,1.7487,1.5102,1.9065,2.1608,4.0262,0.34,2.0889,0.1864,5.6613,2.8859,3.8996,1.6557,2.9192,1.0352,2.896,0.8871,2.174,0.7315,0.0002,2.1602,5.2408,1.2477,3.5911,1.9226,1.9184,0.0112,1.9805,2.7643,3.2521,0.4188,0.0001,3.3823,6.5091,0.6786,2.4128,1.0624,0.0074,5.3668,3.0642,2.7642,0.0032,4.4796,0.3821,1.0849,1.7587,3.0071,2.3675,5.9963,0.322,1.07,5.4423,0.778,3.5319,1.9721,2.2351,2.4077,5.0959,0.6078,1.5003,3.9435,1.7615,1.0449,1.7117,1.0818,1.975,0.0002,5.09,2.0003,0.7467,2.8428,0.8958,1.202,3.5731,1.8803,0.7402,2.1098,6.1832,3.8378,1.6152,1.809,4.4557,2.9617,1.0367,2.8268,2.0468,0.3349,2.33,4.7697,1.7915,0.8191,7.5162,6.3337,4.0604,3.889,0.6928,0.6236,2.1804,4.1328,1.359,1.0567,2.6107,3.4335,0.5975,0.3857,1.239,1.1487,6.7525,4.377,1.3748,4.8002,2.9684,3.8642,4.4977,1.1246,2.6611,2.4267,2.2592,4.1461,2.3495,0.6234,1.5315,3.6754,0.0002,5.7446,0.2993,1.3531,1.2339,1.0284,5.1359,1.4327,3.1667,4.7868,3.2851,6.1241,3.1266,2.7721,4.7714,4.9159,4.8127,6.9911,0.8672,0.0001,3.2787,4.1607,3.9284,3.5702,3.9666,2.7448,2.7064,5.1597,1.3012,2.956,2.4569,1.0799,1.2705,5.0585,4.644,2.5139,0.0002,0.6334,0.5812,3.2535,0.0003,4.3713,0.3882,5.1378,2.096,2.6225,3.6054,3.922,0.4481,1.938,0.7913,0.4012,0.0002,3.3317,5.777,3.844,0.9575,1.8184,1.2697,1.5879,4.3441,0.357,5.4199,0.0003,0.1106,0.018,0.0956,0.0002,4.3187,4.0094,0.0002,0.3559,0.0614,3.7853,6.5667,0.6231,2.7086,1.1347,0.7246,0.0001,4.847,1.4553,3.1951,1.3149,3.4112,2.4131,1.4435,1.4037,1.0698,0.0002,3.4373,4.5042,2.353,0.5029,2.6446,1.7149,4.8342,4.6313,1.5363,0.2944,2.4777,1.8386,4.5604,5.9673,0.3737,0.5643,2.6162,3.9876,1.21,2.6515,3.5754,1.3335,2.7367,0.5569]}
{"id":891,"ended":false,"length":610,"gen_text":"The Sky is Green, it's been that way since they dropped the bomb.\n\n\"It was in the newspaper that somebody said, 'You know what, I'll bet you can make it for less than I'll make it for.' I said, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'\n\n\"There were two days of casting and I had been talking to [the producer of the movie], and I said, 'OK, I'm going to come up and give my audition.'\n\n\"And I said, 'Here's the two hours, and I'll show you if you want to take it or not.' That was the process, with a movie. It's a pretty heavy period piece, so I know what to do. I can do a scene, and it'll be like this.\n\n\"But for me, when I'm talking to a woman, what I'm looking for, there's so much energy and there's so much emotion, so much of the physical world... I found that the difference in the physical world and the emotions was so great for me. I found it so much more powerful than just a physical performance.\n\n\"I've been asked, 'How did you feel about this, when you were on the set?' I said, 'I felt good. At the beginning, it was strange, and at the end, it was very satisfying and so much more rewarding.'\n\nWhen filming that scene in Afghanistan, he thought he knew what he wanted to do to the woman, and he was right. It was very satisfying, and it was just incredible for him to play it.\n\n\"I was completely prepared for that emotional moment, at the beginning, and then all at once I was in ecstasy. I didn't even know what was happening.\n\nHe said he had to make time on set, because there was a lot going on during the time that it took for his makeup to set. And it took some time for him to get into character, because the makeup took some time. He said the look at night when he slept took some time.\n\n\"What was great with this movie was that there were a lot of rehearsals. We're not just shooting a movie and just sort of letting things happen by themselves. We actually have to go on the set and work on the set to get to a certain kind of take of it.\n\n\"We had quite, quite a few days of rehearsal where it was just us together, and that's why it took long. And they were on set for 24 hours a day, so you're just sitting there. There's no way to move. You can't just go up and down the steps.\n\n\"And then on the final day, which was day nine or 10, there were rehearsals. We had the same shoot day that we had today and there was a day and a half where the main effects shots were just us together, and I think that was for security reasons. It was just for the security of the guys.

{"id":1748,"ended":true,"length":609,"gen_text":"Today is your 111th Birthday, you have served The Church for many years and desire to pass away. The only problem however, is that you are a Vampire. A Christian Vampire.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what you are and you are the one to turn today because in today's Church, you are the only one who has the privilege of being in the Vampire clan. Your family and friends are NOT allowed to join you in this life.\n\nSo, today, when the Devil comes knocking at your door and demands your eternal soul, he will surely say : \"You were born in the Church and you have been a member of the Catholic Vampire clan for more than 110 years, but I am going to get you killed because since you were born with this blood you are no longer an authentic member of the Catholic Vampire Clan and you have been banned from joining another Church group in the future \".\n\n\" No way!\" you will say angrily to him and then you will run away from him and hide somewhere to go to sleep until the Devil finds you and kills you so you can stay outside all night.\n\nYou WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS GUY. He will say :\"You know, the Devil told me today you are going to die but you were born a Catholic Vampire, so you might live for 1 year, 2 years or 3 (!\") and now you are dying, so you will NOT be able to join the Family this time.\"\n\nThe next day, you will go to church and you will cry, even harder then today, because you know you will be thrown out of this Church for real, and your family and friends will never accept you in their hearts, even though you were the ONLY one who was born a Catholic Vampire in this country.\n\nToday is my Birthday, I was born in the Catholic Vampire clan in 1922, and I am NOT allowed to go any church.\n\nIf I ever go to the Church, the Devil will kill me, or he will throw me into the back of a van and take me to his stronghold, so you know, tomorrow, I will have to tell my son what I was born for and how I die \".\n\nYou will feel very sad and ashamed that you are so different from the rest of your people and you will hide in church, with a smile on your face, praying to God that he will make you a Catholic, if only he had allowed me to join the Catholic Vampire Clan.\n\nWhen tomorrow comes, you will go to church and, even though you will cry, you will not be able to believe that you were born a Vampire, if only they will accept me after 110 years. Because you were born without our Family, the Vampire Clan, a very few of our Family members can be born without the blood of a Vampire and that means that you will never be allowed to join us\n\nHowever, after your 111th Birthday, they will let you in our Family and today is my Birthday, my eternal life.\n\nForgive me, Father for I have sinned against you in this regard.","token_len":633,"entropy":[3.7957,5.2484,13.8111,0.0749,3.9099,1.8137,4.219,2.6289,5.3052,6.7975,2.4989,2.2404,2.7145,0.1754,1.179,11.3544,0.1919,5.152,4.8805,2.3186,2.936,5.0554,5.1201,7.8857,1.1827,0.1257,0.4748,0.775,1.142,2.9651,8.44,0.7491,3.7296,9.665,0.5487,0.5492,2.2953,0.0352,4.9824,0.1987,4.0505,0.8391,3.8957,0.125,0.8046,0.4762,2.5911,1.5739,1.4083,4.1633,3.3899,1.8418,5.0264,4.847,5.2228,4.256,1.9449,0.1284,3.7676,1.2195,2.1452,0.5682,1.0473,1.3113,0.5998,0.9323,2.2091,0.8985,4.1751,0.6963,1.5878,4.326,1.2971,2.4852,3.5129,0.292,3.9864,3.568,3.2858,0.9057,1.6262,6.7085,0.8987,0.2076,1.8923,1.0868,1.3384,1.2373,2.8327,1.1861,1.2985,0.0001,2.9929,1.2549,1.8735,1.1334,4.2291,2.6395,5.627,1.4858,3.8124,1.0271,0.1775,0.0342,2.4801,3.2883,1.8066,5.1942,0.2853,0.2695,5.8686,0.5269,5.6035,4.3877,7.8625,0.5972,2.1301,4.1719,1.2428,2.6175,0.9028,4.0141,1.9451,1.1577,2.127,1.9601,1.2263,1.4816,1.2016,0.7691,5.4285,2.1361,1.2392,0.3056,3.4961,0.0307,3.3418,0.0373,2.2728,2.1208,2.8792,1.8699,2.656,0.0108,3.1981,0.8408,4.9152,2.7158,6.8486,0.3807,1.8925,0.3795,5.4869,2.1076,2.3521,1.904,1.1054,2.829,0.0357,4.6203,4.9069,0.975,0.1841,0.3137,1.6714,0.0596,1.7891,1.8199,1.8007,2.3834,2.7162,5.3508,0.2354,1.734,6.4847,3.0443,5.7712,3.5648,0.8597,1.2593,5.3229,0.2134,0.0002,5.0641,5.7117,2.3386,3.0568,0.2755,0.6936,0.8051,5.9162,3.3898,1.6874,2.2955,2.656,0.7664,0.1159,3.4664,1.4904,1.5851,1.1478,1.6757,2.0983,2.7638,3.81,4.7089,1.3942,1.4697,4.1626,0.817,1.5562,4.1633,0.0556,1.3236,2.1277,0.018,5.2325,1.6824,0.4582,5.0404,5.7408,4.3242,0.8867,1.2572,0.4289,0.0002,3.0952,5.463,0.9898,3.5529,0.012,0.0009,1.8259,4.9477,0.0708,1.4701,2.7508,1.4242,2.8665,0.9339,4.6447,2.5956,3.9383,0.9424,3.0288,2.5234,5.3252,0.0363,4.7305,2.5776,1.3992,2.5585,0.0369,1.6593,4.6267,1.6627,3.6991,0.7054,1.5691,1.1261,0.031,2.0696,0.7943,1.0236,6.0701,4.5596,2.2032,5.2333,2.6144,2.3483,1.3641,0.1845,0.9613,1.8399,8.3577,9.4817,0.9547,2.0858,6.5671,0.9017,0.6842,3.9005,2.8453,0.8264,0.8185,2.2203,4.1325,2.5082,0.73,0.0046,1.0003,1.5164,6.2389,5.5232,0.5845,2.8321,0.2776,0.0002,3.5384,2.8215,0.6324,0.7762,1.3489,0.1637,2.5252,0.3654,1.7347,0.6482,1.5737,0.0619,4.8443,3.581,5.8488,5.9744,4.2287,3.3497,1.1848,0.8845,0.6768,1.5971,1.8724,1.1453,1.9696,4.7412,0.1615,0.579,2.8936,0.9281,2.5837,4.8966,2.2038,2.0867,3.1429,1.5255,1.0838,0.0555,0.1791,1.9968,3.3484,0.1441,2.2672,0.8578,1.9652,2.7204,2.5607,1.0629,0.6192,2.2507,2.9552,4.1025,1.0531,0.7708,0.9004,0.8242,0.9372,0.4942,0.0173,2.531,1.6252,4.2201,0.7143,0.2844,0.0002,4.285,0.8352,6.1264,2.215,0.9693,1.5181,2.1174,0.0747,0.7839,0.4621,0.8214,0.3163,0.816,2.587,5.5477,1.2037,1.4843,0.7559,1.5323,4.4439,0.6322,0.0856,4.3694,4.7178,2.7038,3.1817,1.686,0.0002,3.6555,2.0376,2.8898,2.48,0.451,2.1496,1.8804,1.2667,2.2482,0.2677,0.1442,1.4309,0.0227,2.0162,4.1691,2.0433,0.1172,3.5829,0.0456,1.8365,0.934,5.6469,0.1389,0.4257,2.2948,0.6655,1.88,0.0657,0.4132,2.1985,5.5246,2.3134,3.6309,4.4081,2.1247,1.6231,4.0924,1.402,1.0648,0.6347,3.7526,0.4952,4.249,0.8977,4.1011,3.695,2.2944,2.2323,0.5096,2.6532,1.8152,2.4284,0.5294,5.2991,5.2779,0.3365,0.0002,3.1702,1.1604,4.3721,2.9896,0.7002,1.5156,4.0289,2.6978,0.3729,1.5232,4.3246,2.6443,0.3719,1.2378,1.3716,0.149,1.9091,4.3021,1.2898,1.042,0.2763,4.132,1.8648,4.8901,2.7321,5.2558,2.0551,3.3553,0.1534,0.0064,0.123,0.7607,4.1392,1.1213,0.5241,1.0476,1.431,0.3617,2.6732,1.4277,1.153,1.6778,3.9473,5.3739,0.8487,1.3014,4.0783,2.7326,2.4917,0.124,0.6423,0.709,1.0135,0.1762,1.1733,1.127,0.2748,0.0002,4.1017,3.6784,0.4227,0.3472,0.6128,0.0858,2.0917,0.2205,0.5291,0.7004,5.5026,3.0952,0.228,0.367,0.8658,1.8631,1.2471,0.3486,0.0363,2.323,1.1639,0.5491,0.0049,2.4622,0.6685,1.0806,1.9527,0.3013,1.0084,1.4399,1.3342,5.6907,1.1882,5.9635,3.2643,2.8073,2.374,5.7036,3.8642,0.0429,1.1511,5.5016,1.7919,3.1722,0.1977,5.9036,6.3863,3.9899,2.2329,2.3882,1.5968,0.4782,0.9296,5.0449,4.2412,4.776,1.9483,1.7378,2.2731,1.9155,2.7967,1.4942,2.3766,4.0176,1.3214,2.5842,0.3359,0.7122,0.3555,2.4222,2.5643,2.6633,0.7263,1.5194,1.8002,1.0163,0.4188,2.4684,0.1502,0.3309,1.8305,6.1781,0.0002,4.3945,0.0535,4.8605,3.4488,2.4057,0.0223,0.3859,0.1794,5.9663,0.1534,2.3395,0.0219,1.1797,3.6484,0.4793,1.684,5.5881,0.6718,4.0972,0.8849,0.6961,3.6763,5.1004,1.4418,2.6469,0.6728,0.0002,4.9064,2.007,0.202,1.549,2.2101,3.75,0.694,0.1414,0.0886,0.0006,1.1472,0.4785,3.8365,2.089,5.5444,1.1602]}
{"id":1986,"ended":true,"length":613,"gen_text":"You are a character in a story who just became aware of the fact that you are a character in a story... and one that has been played to death and whose only motivation is to be told something interesting... then you are also a fictional character... and that's really what it is all about.\"\n\nIf you want to become really good at being you, all you have to do is put yourself out there in the real world.\n\nWhen he got to that realization, he realized he was the new kid on the block. The person with the unique perspective on who he was. \"So I said, I'm going to be myself, but I'm not going to change what I am any more,\" he says.\n\nThen, more amazingly, he created the platform for other people like him to do the same. \"Just give yourself permission to write what you're thinking,\" he advised. As part of his writing philosophy, he also encouraged us to live authentically so we could develop a true sense of authenticity.\n\nIt was in this light that I began to feel confident moving towards some new personal goals\u2014or what I can call my life goals (we'll refer to these as goals in this series), after writing some of this previous stuff for The Daily Muse.\n\nI think I'm finally getting there... Now it's just a matter of letting go of those old life dreams and taking a few more steps towards making a difference that will truly benefit this world.\n\nWhat will help me get there? To me, it's about doing something you love (and if necessary, taking a break from the crazy busy professional world you're so used to in order to pursue that passion at my own pace). It's about being true to myself, my values and my intentions. So, where do I begin?\n\nThe first step was realizing there was enough there already to fuel what I set out to do. Once I said 'enough is enough' about me, it was time for me to be honest with myself about who I was. I had to look at my own behavior and recognize how my ego and selfishness got in the way of what I really wanted to do.\n\nThe second step was admitting there were a lot of people out there in the world that had different and sometimes contradictory versions of myself, but we all thought the same thing and we were all going to take this journey together. So, it took quite, wait for it, some time for me to get to that point.\n\nIf you are on a personal journey, that journey will never be complete until you acknowledge what you are and where you believe you are going. We all have all of these beliefs that we cling to so that there's enough of us on this finite planet for one to exist.

{"id":3089,"ended":true,"length":613,"gen_text":"Today I had my third close encounter with death, but this time I was expecting it.\n\nI had just driven down the road from home, only to find myself suddenly falling fast asleep in the shade of a small white tree across the street.\n\nWhen I woke up, I could not move but found that my shirt was ripped open and was torn to pieces. Now I had a cut above my right eye which ran down the side of my face.\n\nThe other people who were with me in the car, were all dead. This time death has no revenge. There are a couple of reasons for this. For one it was a good encounter, with no one else around, which is very uncommon. But more than that, it was more pleasant to be in the shade with the cool breeze coming off the water and my heart starting beat slowly in the morning, rather than the day before.\n\nI have never found myself getting into an accident before, but have seen so many of the other things I have read about. I have not been in a car accident. In fact, I have not driven one since I began to run. This has been a good thing. I do not know why the mind thinks one thing is so superior to another which is so different.\n\nOne may think I am exaggerating or making things up. My mind has been telling me for years that every accident I got into had a reason for it. When I ran that mile as a teenager, I knew that it had to be done to train. And today, I did it as an excuse to go further. Today, I did it to go longer.\n\nThe sun was starting to rise high in the sky at my location when I found myself in the woods. I was excited to have this opportunity to run, to enjoy the fresh air and see different terrain.\n\nIt was the most beautiful day I could remember during the time that I had been running. It was very early in the morning, so you could really tell how early in the day it had become. I had run from one end of the United States to the other and had not once been tired or tired. The run itself was as fast as I had ever seen my body go. When you run fast your heart is pounding so much that your lungs can't keep up with the effort. This is because of the high rate of oxygen consumption.\n\nWhen I passed by the road with my body covered in blood, it was a sensation of incredible strength to be that far from anyone. What was more exciting to me that day was that I knew I could not die without at least showing the world my accomplishments.\n\nThis is all a great lesson that I would not change.\n\nYou can run as long as you want. It does not matter, everyone lives differently. Some people can go for a mile with no effort at all and yet others are like me, who start in the shade of a tree and run for hours.\n\nThis is my experience. It is what I have gathered from many others. This is me as I was yesterday morning.","token_len":636,"entropy":[3.3061,4.2997,3.1148,4.3097,8.4816,1.7607,0.2816,5.0823,2.0189,2.2815,1.3721,0.3039,1.4197,1.4889,6.4641,0.1147,0.3608,1.7641,0.0192,1.2821,1.8477,1.9216,4.9512,2.8657,1.3048,1.6323,1.7224,4.7994,1.7457,5.777,1.076,1.1327,1.7252,4.3321,5.882,6.3374,0.5672,1.634,0.5966,7.1356,0.1432,0.2853,3.3704,4.8396,2.5862,6.2317,0.323,1.8935,1.0487,1.6922,0.0002,3.5131,0.104,0.8329,0.2127,0.626,0.5,3.471,1.9759,2.2139,5.1849,4.266,2.2987,1.3046,4.5547,0.4656,3.3464,1.5281,1.3204,3.9103,5.6941,1.5353,1.8257,0.3188,6.927,1.0427,2.0833,1.8737,5.1953,3.3576,0.064,1.2894,0.4039,3.5176,4.3996,1.2599,2.0134,1.6309,0.0215,0.0196,0.1399,0.8878,0.9154,0.0002,2.5814,4.6587,5.2331,2.1073,1.0365,1.4477,0.0101,2.9193,0.1721,0.2835,2.5725,2.0053,2.0799,2.5784,0.6717,5.3078,2.5095,4.6035,4.2681,3.5576,5.694,0.4913,5.1191,2.1708,4.3673,2.8548,0.3525,3.557,0.9657,0.3157,0.579,3.9421,0.2227,3.8457,0.534,1.3987,4.574,5.5795,1.4129,4.8237,1.1237,2.6696,2.8371,0.5304,1.8575,3.9529,2.2936,2.9927,4.3448,0.9175,3.7177,1.7924,2.3343,0.3149,0.4834,1.5467,0.2849,6.0218,5.9867,1.467,1.6513,2.8081,1.0695,3.3001,2.9037,1.5777,2.3959,1.2656,3.533,1.8534,0.197,1.6633,2.2,4.4924,5.2923,5.0673,8.9478,4.1885,3.4612,2.0219,3.2223,3.1319,2.8983,0.0266,1.9143,4.9693,0.142,1.2409,0.252,0.0002,1.6329,2.553,3.2478,4.6712,1.8579,4.9177,2.9968,2.9285,1.0473,1.5402,0.7932,0.8127,5.3437,3.3083,3.962,0.0546,3.6332,2.4883,3.2175,2.6215,2.5226,1.0404,1.9052,0.3691,1.5317,1.4838,1.5031,3.8788,1.797,1.5638,0.8939,0.4417,0.2756,3.1798,3.7814,0.475,0.8807,0.4489,0.6897,2.0177,2.7195,4.1824,2.2594,0.7146,3.4892,1.9882,5.8346,1.0018,3.4541,2.572,1.7498,1.0373,2.9093,1.0549,1.2595,1.5066,3.0296,0.1174,2.6089,1.571,4.6342,5.9637,3.9209,5.6722,1.9155,1.926,2.6111,5.8457,0.3248,0.7751,6.152,0.9355,2.0247,3.0778,0.5295,1.0536,0.0002,3.9165,5.5325,1.7353,2.9029,0.4371,2.8055,0.0002,2.9514,2.3606,1.8118,0.0761,1.9039,4.5703,2.8373,2.1987,1.7661,3.1191,0.016,2.6679,1.0803,0.4973,6.1166,2.3316,1.32,5.5897,0.1452,3.0073,2.5004,2.0099,3.1019,0.0822,0.5267,4.4756,0.4895,3.8085,5.5183,4.9237,6.0368,0.6082,2.3498,0.6353,0.567,3.4154,1.6912,2.4839,1.7038,1.2792,0.5884,5.2097,1.6894,4.9028,2.7163,4.1028,5.5014,1.1913,1.1171,3.493,1.3427,3.3333,2.9157,4.1049,0.4359,3.0016,5.878,1.0626,5.4403,1.9661,0.3914,1.9114,0.5934,0.9842,4.317,4.3974,0.2235,0.9126,0.0002,2.8305,4.4359,0.9664,3.3713,0.0109,0.8606,5.6017,0.6708,0.0079,0.1394,5.7153,3.8885,3.1862,3.0298,0.2301,3.5024,0.6267,2.6114,1.0345,3.9858,1.1089,0.8803,1.669,5.5761,1.0581,3.7589,4.0312,1.908,0.6023,0.726,2.693,2.6704,4.7654,0.5939,3.0711,0.2588,0.7731,3.431,7.003,4.9422,0.3843,1.5942,0.0002,3.2518,0.5942,3.5712,3.5866,0.8593,1.1259,1.4834,2.8241,0.59,6.1105,1.7604,4.3739,2.7095,0.1151,1.3821,0.4086,0.8285,0.3174,2.482,0.4224,3.8836,2.034,0.6257,0.0144,0.1996,1.1889,2.1595,5.7011,0.3396,4.2964,3.2879,1.6232,2.1774,1.9102,0.0063,1.6339,0.1443,2.7526,4.3036,0.2267,1.7867,1.9876,3.0151,4.2173,3.8396,0.8133,0.0892,0.4966,5.1201,0.0159,0.2621,0.1327,0.0079,2.1974,1.9386,2.057,4.6145,2.4795,1.5017,2.2932,1.5299,2.6102,2.9309,5.0139,3.348,0.6133,4.5505,2.5956,0.1475,0.8105,1.3639,0.5464,4.0397,4.223,0.7169,1.6509,0.4602,4.5714,2.5454,1.5588,3.3929,3.3333,2.268,2.2158,3.132,2.9005,2.4145,0.6459,1.6555,2.7791,2.589,1.0325,2.8194,0.06,1.4191,0.9337,2.9273,0.3652,2.6743,0.7891,3.7701,2.4426,0.4583,2.5666,3.2149,0.0265,0.8867,1.3135,1.191,1.07,0.0002,2.56,1.2353,4.9763,2.9287,0.9593,3.7673,4.6503,1.1336,5.2355,3.463,0.1627,1.4583,0.6684,2.4134,0.6618,2.0514,5.6307,2.1832,5.3775,4.3348,4.2828,1.7007,5.1117,2.3121,1.8328,4.555,1.0077,5.9833,2.0441,2.7431,3.4594,1.8843,0.043,4.6304,1.6517,0.3225,1.0491,0.6628,3.4446,1.2097,1.8014,1.8667,1.7568,5.7897,4.6975,0.0189,6.055,2.3982,1.145,2.5462,3.3002,0.2105,0.9647,0.0002,3.4895,1.1698,5.5873,3.2717,4.1173,1.9298,2.7391,0.7775,4.6922,2.8719,1.3547,1.3155,1.7897,0.0001,4.4927,0.9857,3.0373,2.534,0.922,0.1952,0.0573,0.2874,1.9007,2.9597,2.2899,0.0456,0.1624,3.6252,6.6389,6.1802,2.4559,0.3825,3.5875,0.9927,2.205,3.0153,1.1421,2.418,2.1531,3.8701,0.6546,2.8318,1.3694,0.0016,1.7832,5.1165,1.0384,2.9696,4.691,0.8157,1.081,1.6127,5.8989,4.4344,0.3957,2.0305,1.9433,0.1959,0.4711,0.7186,2.3587,1.5649,1.0958,0.7344,1.2261,0.0002,3.709,0.6051,3.3577,2.8511,1.1254,2.6739,0.5318,1.9978,0.485,0.89,6.1358,0.7314,3.3833,2.0829,0.9167,2.9619,0.1289,5.3889,3.9803,0.7986,2.5303,3.4424,3.0376,0.5121]}
{"id":2226,"ended":true,"length":595,"gen_text":"A twist on a classic. A zombie apocalypse in which ANIMALS are turning into zombies.\n\nTHE ZOMBIE AND THE COWBOYS!\n\nThe Zombie-Apocalypse has come to the small town of Fonville.\n\nWhen the children's playhouse erupts in a nuclear fission that turns the cows and cows into zombies, all hell breaks lose. The children must find a way to protect the house, and each other, from the zombies that rampage through the playground, trying to bite the children. The playwrights must find ways to entertain and amuse their children; one thing is certain; it's hard to entertain a herd of angry cows.\n\nFor any one reading this post, know that a large percentage of what you are about to read probably makes no sense at all, and are entirely unrelated to zombies whatsoever.\n\nFor the rest of you, prepare yourself, and prepare to read a very big, very long, really, REALLY weird story.\n\nThank you!! This story is based on a great number of things. A number of real historical accounts and historical events like the plague of the Black Death, when Europe was very much like New South Wales in the 1800's. An amazing, absolutely unbelievable, story (and an amazing writer) named L. Ron Hubbard. This is the story of his son, David Miscavige.\n\nAnd I got the idea of a zombie tale from an actual zombie that I saw in the mall recently. The zombie had an actual face like a real-life woman, and was wearing an actual wig, and was eating real brains and was the exact same height and weight as a human. It was a REALLY cool zombie at the mall; I found it in the shopping plaza in front of the mall that my friend and I go to every year. I saw this zombie at the mall for the first time ever over a year or two ago, and it was one of the most compelling, realistic, and memorable zombie experiences that I could have had in the mall; and, it was over the course of about two minutes. I went back many, many times since then to see how it was doing, and it seemed fine, but I never found it again. When I did, though, I kept thinking that I saw it years ago just a little bit off in the distance; I didn't really want to go over there and check it out. So, with this, my zombie fiction, it gives new meaning to this phrase, \"be careful where you park your car\".\n\nAs always, if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for future posts please feel free to leave a comment below. Thank you!\n\nAnd, also, there's a sequel coming up, it's titled \"The Return of the Living Dead\"!!\n\nOh, and the story was written in the style of a diary of a young lady living in the town the story takes place in; so, if you haven't read it yet, you will have to be prepared!

At the age of 21 the better one is selected and the other one is put to death.\n\nHowever, in the current era, those people who are better than others need to be cloned with them. Otherwise, the latter one will die.\n\nMoreover, cloned people are made of the same body but with different mind, so they can be called'clones after different minds '.\n\nThe 'Clones After Different Mind' sect has many people who have gone to the sect and became teachers for cloned disciples. The disciples of the sect has many people who can perform the art and have a high level of cultivation. However, as the sect is not wealthy the sect's disciples cannot find a way to buy themselves. As a result, the sect's disciples have to stay together in the sect.\n\nAt the moment, the sect's disciples from many places and races are staying together with their clones, there are many clones here and there.\n\nPeople from other sects are very curious about the sect's clone sect, the sect's disciples also have their own cloned clones. Some people said that the sect's clones are really good and that when they die they will revive.\n\nAt the age of twenty-one, the better one is selected and the other one is put to death.\n\nAfter one thousand years, the sect has grown and become stronger, it is the very first of its kind. The sect has many people who can live as they want and others who need to stay together with the Clone sect will only become a living hell. It has very high requirements if one wants to be a clone.\n\nEvery person on this planet are born in this place but they are at the age when they leave the planet. If one is born in the sect then they are allowed to go out of the planet. At this moment, one can only live as a clone here.\n\nHowever, after a thousand years, the clone sect has been abandoned, people's spirits have become dead, people have left the sect. After ten thousand years, the sect had to shut its doors and the people died.\n\nThus, today, today I am bringing you a clone of you.\n\nAt the current time, we are here, in one place in the year 473 A.D. We are on the world where the people are clones of each other.\n\nThere are many types of clones on the world. For example, those people who are good, those people who are bad, those people who are evil, those types of clones.\n\nAs for these cloned people, they do not choose their own fate but the fate of whoever they are made of.\n\nSo, who is that person?\n\nThere is a man living in this cloning facility\n\nHe was born on this world a thousand years ago\n\nAnd his life has no purpose\n\nThis way, he will not die the same death, he will live a more peaceful life that cannot be described.","token_len":637,"entropy":[4.4718,2.6986,11.4954,1.8935,3.6102,1.3663,4.4303,1.8821,0.4943,0.2275,2.7882,3.5654,3.8427,0.7089,3.0594,3.7275,1.5436,4.3023,1.7314,4.931,0.8652,2.0283,0.0325,3.877,3.2609,11.9907,3.6442,1.2962,9.8086,1.4398,2.662,3.8169,1.9169,0.7062,3.8636,1.9329,0.6989,0.4889,1.8097,0.0124,4.968,0.2682,2.7593,0.9128,5.3169,2.6889,0.8706,5.2755,3.2702,0.6717,1.4755,4.4386,0.6541,1.5819,6.2757,0.3759,1.3687,3.849,0.0006,4.2182,4.8245,0.9342,4.983,0.3734,1.8645,6.2983,3.0488,0.9865,2.4713,1.5629,0.7087,0.0002,5.083,0.0497,6.083,0.2284,0.7378,1.4945,5.3468,3.3657,1.5502,1.0189,3.5733,2.956,2.644,0.6314,5.1045,2.7957,1.8084,1.1422,1.584,1.7662,3.7769,10.5777,3.5662,0.2303,5.7614,5.6051,1.6831,8.5258,0.4623,0.0002,2.3439,4.8805,2.838,1.2666,2.8629,0.0463,0.06,0.9442,4.5026,2.4944,3.1392,2.5909,1.3357,1.6476,4.7656,1.9541,0.8004,2.2964,1.8893,3.9757,5.6166,3.9768,4.6609,0.0224,3.0364,0.33,3.176,3.0882,1.7682,0.6347,0.2105,5.4336,2.7434,3.8253,0.7584,3.7681,5.5345,2.0639,5.8797,3.1239,3.6174,2.9007,1.6823,1.6368,0.1657,0.7625,0.4713,3.2545,0.0805,4.5057,1.7722,1.0264,1.2027,2.3056,5.7003,5.254,1.6982,2.7441,1.7433,2.7591,5.3472,1.2633,2.8973,0.1469,3.7356,4.3598,2.2367,3.9883,0.9367,0.0415,0.2315,1.6407,0.7126,1.7665,0.7085,1.898,1.3401,4.4062,3.3028,2.0914,0.9328,0.2597,1.1797,0.4087,0.0002,4.2469,0.668,1.8059,0.4252,0.9609,0.8937,1.2064,0.5717,6.1306,4.3833,2.3997,4.2194,4.665,0.7886,2.6572,0.5373,4.4979,1.8051,1.3045,2.9556,5.1396,0.3198,1.9344,4.4368,4.9854,2.1556,0.6536,0.6964,1.1078,0.0002,5.4517,1.7799,2.894,0.5758,1.8435,4.2033,1.434,0.6422,0.6991,1.0988,1.0003,3.0362,2.5768,1.7961,3.5361,1.5175,0.6872,0.9765,3.9534,1.2365,3.6318,0.5438,2.9295,0.393,3.1954,1.0274,3.7184,1.2677,5.379,0.2427,1.3065,1.0448,0.567,1.3593,0.772,3.7702,2.7119,2.0272,2.2722,5.4929,0.6275,2.7048,0.974,0.7357,6.1093,1.886,0.6559,0.0002,4.0559,0.5785,4.0486,0.0431,2.8132,2.0327,0.549,0.6679,1.0501,2.3967,0.5072,0.5427,0.6963,0.5826,0.297,0.146,0.1329,0.1546,0.0737,0.0129,0.0088,0.1026,0.8021,0.0002,3.1255,4.0016,3.4424,0.1428,0.7255,0.7826,3.2893,2.6929,3.995,2.1204,2.5577,3.4752,1.6776,2.5987,1.5954,3.012,6.0151,1.1922,4.3866,1.3507,0.0179,0.9198,2.2492,1.167,1.6547,1.7314,1.9908,0.6522,1.6639,6.0317,4.6257,3.9072,1.6489,1.1297,5.3812,0.3952,2.5471,0.1713,2.1006,0.7053,1.8038,2.232,7.0264,0.5963,7.0931,4.264,3.2734,2.7323,5.4941,3.1909,0.4595,4.8376,3.0191,5.2966,2.2749,2.7425,6.9402,0.6881,0.2837,0.0077,1.951,0.6893,1.2236,1.132,0.6603,0.0002,5.2635,1.4883,5.736,2.4966,1.0531,3.3363,3.0146,3.1297,3.0116,2.7998,3.4871,2.1187,1.8443,6.0366,0.6408,0.7625,3.284,0.1802,5.053,1.1796,1.0319,0.9776,3.456,1.2644,1.8146,1.4878,0.8086,0.8583,2.6078,1.8221,1.1262,2.3243,2.9666,0.024,4.058,1.637,1.2307,0.1548,2.9821,1.0196,4.2709,2.5551,1.5981,0.4014,4.741,1.0439,1.7248,3.0336,1.9898,1.1247,0.3344,2.8961,0.5653,0.5731,0.0002,3.0952,0.0615,3.7877,2.4318,0.725,0.0326,0.5749,1.0153,1.8766,0.5152,2.7564,3.5944,4.6135,2.2551,3.54,4.604,4.8252,0.7861,2.4135,5.0849,1.5452,3.4335,1.4086,4.233,0.4161,0.9623,1.2231,3.9606,4.8707,0.2136,0.0242,0.3429,0.595,1.2436,3.5647,3.7571,4.2065,2.1266,0.1939,1.9537,2.5739,1.868,4.6555,0.6363,0.6368,0.0002,5.9714,0.2203,4.0681,0.7612,3.5286,3.627,1.2715,5.3433,0.6675,2.1023,1.8897,1.8674,4.415,1.0199,0.8027,0.0001,3.9296,0.4641,4.5071,0.9395,0.2328,4.5081,0.8179,3.0942,1.924,2.4688,5.7532,3.1355,2.6796,0.4652,6.3841,4.798,5.4228,2.4156,0.0259,0.032,0.6091,3.8331,0.5829,4.3985,0.589,3.9748,2.3359,1.2806,4.0443,1.9189,3.38,1.8949,1.3299,0.0201,0.5098,1.0003,0.0002,3.5725,0.3468,1.1486,4.5493,0.0179,1.1421,2.8787,1.4174,1.4491,1.2705,3.5358,0.1752,0.1673,3.6329,2.2716,0.3725,1.0927,1.7716,3.0399,1.0746,0.936,0.1869,0.1047,1.1945,0.3732,0.3666,0.6341,0.2156,0.3135,3.7249,0.4995,0.4434,6.6816,0.285,0.9576,0.4411,0.8701,0.0002,4.1609,0.8605,4.4255,4.1418,0.0439,0.155,0.2175,0.9517,3.7214,0.0809,6.2015,0.7,0.7463,2.5874,2.4902,2.6055,0.5947,0.4967,6.3973,0.8239,0.7109,4.9299,0.5056,0.4894,1.087,0.0001,5.1732,0.8028,4.2078,1.0627,3.843,1.1376,0.9853,0.5816,0.0001,4.5012,1.1074,1.1191,2.3426,5.5721,0.5881,1.4376,4.7558,4.5759,5.7049,0.0002,1.8131,2.7927,0.9271,2.354,2.1172,1.4808,5.1863,0.632,0.0333,0.0256,2.7741,0.0002,3.7107,2.7451,2.7801,1.9848,4.8248,2.5932,1.6709,0.0002,4.351,7.2337,0.6211,1.1108,1.9925,2.7734,0.958,5.6072,1.3974,3.2781,4.4364,1.4242,0.3278,1.6698,1.9922,4.3788,2.4159,0.1198,6.0594,5.9164,0.1485,1.691,1.1254]}
{"id":1495,"ended":true,"length":602,"gen_text":"A curse was placed on you in which your life shortens based on the amount of time people spend thinking about you. You make it your goal to be the most uninteresting person in the world. You never talk to anyone in the real world except to insult them and make them feel like shit.\n\n. You have mastered the art of making others seem interesting enough to be your next conquest. Your family and friends think you are so interesting that even if you are not happy all day and you have a job to get up in the middle of the night to do, you still have time to find interesting things to do on your spare time.\n\n. On top of all that, you're a very beautiful person with a great personality and amazing looks. You're a beautiful example of the human condition: If you want something you do it. You never, ever ever complain. You will do anything to have what you want.\n\n. You can't change who your parents are and you never will.\n\n. You can never go to a prom date with somebody.\n\nand you. You are a coward.\n\n. You live alone with a cat and a small dog. You're not ashamed to admit that you like dogs and cats.\n\n. You have never had a real job where you were responsible for things.\n\nwhere you were responsible for things. You are only allowed to talk to other people on internet.\n\n. You don't have a lot of friends, maybe 6 on facebook and 3 at school. At school most people shun you because as you mentioned earlier your personality is a pain in the ass to deal with.\n\n\n, maybe. It takes very little to make you give up and just move on. You're not good enough so your job sucks and I won't even start trying to explain why.\n\n\nI won't even try I don't want to go through my life being treated like that. At this point i don't even want to read the comments I hate reading it sooo much but this is so depressing it's actually hard to put this off any longer. This is why I refuse to continue reading here, it's just so bad to read.\n\nI can tell you that at the time I wrote this I am currently unemployed and on my way to being homeless. I'm not happy with anything anymore and I'm sorry I didn't get better at keeping my mouth shut, I'm now realizing after all these years of suffering I want to kill myself right now. I'm taking a huge mental and emotional toll and it sucks.\n\n\nSorry for this rant but I feel like I must tell.\n\nI hate talking on reddit because when I do I can't stop reading the bullshit. Most of the time the rambling doesn't even make sense to me. I used to have a big thing of self-care but even I was overwhelmed by the amount of shit that goes on here. Most users take a little break but no one seems to stop to think about what they are saying in the slightest bit.\n\n\nI hope I never have to write this again.","token_len":638,"entropy":[10.5446,3.8143,2.0565,0.656,3.6831,4.2562,5.8185,2.0778,3.6758,7.4945,0.0621,10.6928,0.1,0.9927,2.7148,0.0199,2.1438,7.5632,0.6924,4.6228,0.2157,0.0782,0.4081,1.9055,6.9159,2.9753,3.2038,1.7077,0.1846,6.3147,2.347,1.0887,7.3086,0.9522,0.166,0.3461,0.1157,1.0495,1.2432,1.2826,4.2572,3.2718,0.9679,0.4251,5.1156,1.7154,1.7655,0.0027,3.3596,1.8166,3.0279,0.3205,1.8949,1.8464,1.5652,0.6865,4.238,0.461,0.3124,1.9448,0.0048,7.6032,2.3631,2.4948,6.2624,0.3054,0.0913,0.0104,2.3607,2.765,5.9333,3.6428,4.9494,0.2936,2.7298,2.0228,4.0843,4.0338,0.3567,3.3419,6.0589,1.2588,0.1014,2.7221,0.5846,0.7256,2.8542,1.6961,0.6161,4.8785,2.2214,0.6934,2.7809,2.3878,5.5355,4.6096,1.8891,3.7654,2.4764,2.4117,1.9134,4.1252,2.6558,2.784,2.9234,2.9856,0.0186,2.6545,0.0013,0.0092,0.0051,0.4677,1.5376,0.3317,1.1656,1.9938,2.4292,1.0408,0.1643,4.1546,4.472,1.0368,0.0576,0.6179,1.8639,1.4064,3.954,0.0185,0.2349,1.1257,0.0001,0.508,7.1529,2.2246,0.0029,1.3784,1.2557,0.2056,0.2167,3.6361,2.0555,4.3998,5.0711,1.0324,2.0562,1.0345,1.4879,1.1303,1.5885,4.1819,1.3039,0.2118,1.3055,1.6029,2.4782,4.4498,3.2965,0.137,2.4048,2.4734,1.3107,3.2141,5.2067,0.4904,2.3926,0.933,3.1138,4.3652,1.0353,1.2716,1.4764,2.5864,4.1757,0.0586,5.7538,2.0252,1.3557,0.999,3.6699,2.004,0.6733,0.7588,3.3877,0.6307,0.0106,0.0537,0.4301,0.9683,0.0002,0.4492,0.8312,3.8479,1.7895,6.0645,1.8847,5.6594,0.5761,0.1185,2.9439,1.2409,2.7263,0.4572,0.3991,2.49,0.0001,0.2553,0.5547,2.8164,1.7876,3.3199,1.1745,1.8701,5.568,7.2413,2.1568,5.0202,3.3918,0.9065,0.0002,8.344,1.8747,6.6931,0.7331,2.0552,1.8377,5.2822,0.6857,1.7216,0.0001,0.5773,0.3105,4.4008,3.6189,2.6535,2.3788,2.2542,1.5349,1.1962,3.4161,0.5056,0.5052,1.1765,3.0062,2.503,4.3685,0.7356,1.2871,0.6865,0.4486,2.9335,3.1773,1.7222,0.1711,0.5194,0.9451,0.0002,0.2574,0.2639,1.8681,2.6105,2.0485,0.633,2.9142,2.2406,5.1827,0.0766,2.8611,2.7965,0.045,4.2184,1.2351,0.9595,0.0002,7.9472,0.0137,0.0091,0.0022,0.0012,0.0021,0.0013,0.1652,1.9198,5.3033,3.0918,0.2189,3.7963,1.0,2.2546,0.5366,2.2174,5.2931,3.1752,0.4176,0.0002,0.7162,0.2783,2.9026,0.0006,1.6794,0.775,4.5947,0.0413,0.2455,2.3789,5.1891,5.4372,5.5935,4.4375,1.4842,2.8282,3.6115,0.6525,0.186,5.5841,0.6274,5.4457,1.0644,6.0221,0.0442,1.2305,8.1672,1.4116,2.8632,2.5385,3.6022,2.8049,0.5773,2.8298,2.7383,0.3064,0.1286,0.1227,1.7181,0.5445,0.0019,0.273,4.7832,0.0004,8.3208,6.2304,7.4263,4.0253,4.8727,5.4678,0.2121,1.6118,1.5838,0.2559,6.0444,0.1191,2.5487,2.395,3.4707,0.5701,0.7276,1.7892,2.3953,1.9606,4.4912,3.3129,5.1247,4.296,5.5701,2.4465,1.0598,6.4615,4.5941,0.0021,1.7233,3.3531,4.9611,0.0179,1.1602,0.7238,1.0054,3.9099,0.0002,2.5868,4.9549,0.002,1.3846,1.1603,7.8392,2.8124,0.0005,1.3477,0.0655,2.5364,0.9257,4.967,0.8105,3.1064,4.0964,0.3288,2.6235,0.4539,5.7943,2.4762,0.0653,5.2331,2.623,0.0006,1.3017,1.399,0.0942,5.243,2.3109,2.5872,4.0937,3.9276,1.8372,4.4817,2.1131,5.1935,0.3499,2.744,3.6526,0.627,3.7501,3.4934,3.2209,0.808,4.001,2.6296,0.2008,4.7701,3.6463,3.2525,1.2561,0.0927,0.3191,4.0696,0.6572,2.5831,0.5867,5.5932,0.0134,5.0604,3.0856,4.7987,2.756,2.6522,0.3556,2.6514,1.5548,3.7214,3.5335,0.9863,0.9311,2.7881,0.0002,1.3978,3.491,4.4551,0.4506,1.9462,3.7211,1.7428,2.1545,0.9155,3.0197,0.1905,0.8437,3.8602,3.0992,2.9868,0.7904,3.9526,2.4475,0.8139,0.302,2.8815,0.3508,0.4905,0.8009,1.7736,1.8285,4.4517,2.0203,3.7911,3.5947,1.3765,0.6409,1.4381,5.4235,2.2459,2.6549,0.0002,2.211,2.9321,3.0703,6.1633,1.2155,1.3507,0.01,3.2268,1.0335,1.4977,6.1517,5.6293,6.6887,1.9246,1.9349,0.2266,2.6192,4.5769,1.9275,6.2646,0.3444,5.2816,0.0752,4.8376,0.1453,0.3377,1.2736,1.5048,5.7717,1.9647,3.1662,3.7996,1.8461,0.3432,0.8495,2.1448,2.0695,4.2397,0.8217,1.957,0.0003,5.1181,0.8813,3.7424,2.6062,1.5742,0.6111,3.1624,0.6438,0.7358,4.776,3.6893,5.8602,1.9272,0.0002,1.5253,3.6565,5.5474,3.9078,3.2705,2.484,5.005,0.6115,1.4484,0.9272,3.9461,0.5884,1.6942,4.7754,1.281,5.6925,1.552,6.1504,0.4739,0.516,0.946,2.605,5.4636,2.7458,3.4848,0.0002,1.5349,0.2933,0.1873,2.1207,0.1243,1.5345,1.1612,5.1764,0.0074,2.7125,0.7061,5.7045,4.7636,2.8086,3.8153,1.0129,3.7663,1.3611,5.2034,2.1587,4.1626,4.3407,0.9107,1.131,1.1887,0.0099,1.8998,2.052,3.0202,0.3841,1.064,0.5193,5.5578,5.9073,5.7723,3.133,5.0946,3.6029,3.8542,5.0972,0.4864,2.2979,0.0735,2.7867,2.8035,0.8536,0.7953,1.1337,0.3418,1.5667,0.7551,5.5453,1.4496,4.3279,2.769,0.3945,1.9326,0.0003,1.074,3.5243,1.897,3.29,0.95,0.0696,3.048,1.0018,0.5621,1.056]}
{"id":3422,"ended":true,"length":602,"gen_text":"A band of thieves have just broken into the bank vault, only they find no money but... something else.\n\nA band of thieves have just been hired to steal money, but instead turn up something... other than stolen money?\n\nThe film follows the adventures of three robbers in their time of need as they try to hold on to those precious coins that they believe are of great value after finding them inside the vault.\n\nIt is a very good story and well told, although the dialogue seems rather forced and the movie was shot with the same old camera. On the other hand, the ending of the movie is very entertaining and I would like to see more of the movie with a more experienced director. There is a scene at the beginning of the movie that takes more than one minute to get to and it is too long.\n\nThe movie starts with the protagonists in the vault, who are led by the charming Jack White, who appears again in a very dramatic scene at the beginning of the film.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the protagonists are in the same position and the same way that we are in Jack White's band, when they are about to perform when they are trying to get a job at the casino, one of the most famous in the world. The rest of the movie is devoted to these five guys, as their bank robbery takes place without any complication and they end up having a very enjoyable time of it. It makes perfect sense because it is that kind of movie, and nothing seems that out of the ordinary.\n\nAll-in-all, this movie has very high stakes, because the money is only a fraction of the total amount you are after, as they say, but somehow I enjoyed the movie a little more because at the end we get a very entertaining and entertaining ending with lots of funny and funny things that you will never forget.\n\nIt is not a big investment to take the gamble with Jack White and this movie, and with the ending it was worth it, if you know what I mean.\n\nThis movie had some great scenes that will take your breath away, something the big budget movies did not have back then like getting out of the car without even a scratch, or the scene where one of the robbers turns around and he is all alone. If you are a fan of Jack White then you will love this movie because everything is very different from anything we have seen in Jack White movies till date.\n\nThe film does not have strong characters but they work well because they make the movie work and they become part of the movie they are in. It really makes the movie more enjoyable to watch.\n\nThe movie had the same cast this time around like Mick Jagger, Mick Fleetwood and Pete Townshend.\n\nSo far this movie has got me interested again, and I would recommend this movie to Jack White fans, new and old, no matter if you are a fan of him or not.\n\nHave a good night, and may you remember this for days to come.\n\nP.S We are grateful to our loyal reviewers for the review.","token_len":638,"entropy":[8.4519,0.9639,4.2015,3.3338,5.1624,2.8531,0.0847,0.9723,4.8987,1.0609,3.2632,3.6915,4.2026,4.9987,4.6275,1.161,3.903,4.9578,3.6797,0.8785,0.8307,1.8478,0.0094,2.8548,2.6136,0.0051,0.1636,0.2107,0.0224,6.2046,2.4194,0.6419,1.3979,3.6057,2.667,0.9091,2.6489,6.8562,1.4245,2.5406,4.4714,3.6718,2.0887,5.9643,0.2826,1.9089,0.2929,0.0001,2.5942,5.7168,1.7748,1.2847,2.664,0.0347,2.7507,4.411,2.8179,2.9082,6.0232,0.597,0.3276,2.227,0.0551,1.8083,0.1557,5.6125,1.2317,0.0768,7.2777,1.9002,2.0416,3.1791,1.4933,3.9529,1.3374,5.634,1.8639,0.3536,7.7153,3.8662,1.7207,3.5366,1.3424,0.5795,0.6813,0.4666,0.0002,4.2297,1.3786,1.288,4.067,3.6245,3.6274,1.8508,3.4666,2.174,1.2419,3.5265,1.5225,3.9009,4.3426,3.1227,2.9797,1.326,2.2373,4.0969,4.7234,3.1997,2.8556,3.0449,2.5306,2.5505,2.4429,2.4789,6.1956,0.2863,0.4454,0.0231,0.4044,0.5916,6.0634,3.0277,0.1132,0.6547,0.6393,1.7548,4.9986,0.7122,3.2917,2.4345,3.186,0.0668,0.1595,1.5625,1.126,2.0506,2.6907,4.1145,1.5381,2.0109,5.0095,0.6394,0.4034,5.0774,0.8833,1.3518,3.1093,2.6564,0.0615,2.1727,0.6212,0.0129,0.2138,1.3367,4.5131,6.3187,0.613,2.7264,1.5958,0.6153,1.5211,0.6017,2.1041,1.4721,0.9239,4.9291,0.2236,1.0913,0.9791,0.0002,1.5453,1.7483,3.7184,0.8989,1.604,4.6847,2.7621,1.1591,2.308,1.1616,3.3584,0.848,5.3082,0.2659,2.0487,4.9586,6.013,4.7202,1.562,1.163,4.9581,6.3925,0.8349,2.6972,3.3104,5.0598,1.6391,2.3087,0.0353,1.5044,0.2837,0.0095,1.9432,0.357,1.5347,0.0002,3.775,0.3942,0.6575,0.2321,0.0282,1.2359,0.3784,1.0013,2.3607,0.8839,3.0268,0.8572,4.7536,2.3786,3.9773,1.8646,0.985,3.6384,2.2846,2.7207,1.485,1.3895,6.912,0.5459,0.079,2.7849,1.6494,3.7475,0.7758,1.4296,2.7875,0.0056,2.7473,6.0691,0.9487,1.2484,5.9036,0.0213,2.2485,2.4417,2.5671,3.0846,1.0623,4.123,2.4985,5.4599,0.2455,0.3457,2.2348,0.9205,1.115,0.579,0.5356,0.3026,2.3639,5.6085,0.1122,0.0232,0.8373,1.5229,4.7091,0.0444,4.5239,6.2862,2.5035,1.5916,2.7275,4.496,5.7824,1.2577,3.1417,0.3772,6.4493,1.2109,5.3878,1.7876,1.3574,4.7466,0.1004,4.137,1.5395,1.8865,3.1831,0.7024,3.8329,0.3147,0.2166,4.1104,5.434,4.9985,0.0094,3.9823,2.7043,0.3584,6.0648,1.2144,0.0016,0.8188,1.6564,2.772,5.9679,3.6154,4.9751,1.9574,0.0142,0.8305,0.0482,0.3864,0.4426,0.0002,4.6766,6.7761,0.1247,0.0083,0.0119,0.1626,1.2356,1.5226,2.9902,4.1359,4.0526,5.4228,1.2526,4.5021,1.3975,2.2346,0.8711,5.4719,1.8406,2.6553,0.0408,0.9883,1.452,1.5576,7.4365,1.9364,2.3225,1.1076,4.0141,3.0846,2.182,1.3648,1.9494,6.3689,5.035,4.0976,1.1246,0.5543,2.5443,4.2679,0.8406,2.294,5.4554,0.4873,0.3522,2.8793,1.8415,1.3932,1.9716,2.8568,1.524,2.75,0.588,3.8001,3.885,0.0145,3.1221,2.2632,2.8055,4.0107,1.5157,3.0405,1.4575,2.0656,0.7923,0.2689,0.5552,0.0002,3.8977,0.4511,2.6652,1.0536,4.865,5.8049,1.6395,4.1222,1.7914,5.0782,2.4563,3.1631,0.0083,1.5639,2.6361,0.756,2.1138,2.1554,5.1437,1.7838,4.4233,1.7594,2.8538,1.5978,0.7608,1.9991,3.6678,0.8607,4.4196,0.4254,0.8127,0.0256,0.1956,0.5537,0.0002,3.3179,0.4649,5.1182,2.7951,2.4184,2.8778,2.3342,2.4823,4.3586,0.9351,0.3056,0.0058,1.0625,6.4317,4.8571,5.6168,1.075,1.2279,4.9782,0.0244,0.7854,3.3679,0.8341,5.1411,6.3724,4.1442,0.1621,0.8869,1.021,3.8603,5.1454,2.9899,0.123,1.2527,1.5654,1.8579,2.3716,0.9009,3.6408,0.1039,0.1057,0.7848,5.3895,1.7388,0.6292,4.6525,1.23,4.6261,1.6773,2.7541,4.5292,0.2227,1.4778,1.2197,0.2247,0.0131,1.2327,0.0059,3.4386,0.6131,0.8211,1.4257,0.1171,0.0952,3.3671,4.8489,1.3784,2.1721,3.5501,0.7395,3.1299,2.1753,0.5395,0.3112,1.819,3.3443,0.0147,1.692,5.042,1.2141,0.2696,0.4451,0.0002,2.1813,2.9676,4.2635,0.3968,0.9979,6.7894,2.061,2.2658,2.2388,4.348,1.1968,4.1551,0.8916,3.6877,0.7965,0.9502,2.4015,1.4805,1.6405,6.1436,1.6661,0.0037,0.2212,2.4296,6.4433,0.4679,1.0248,0.6114,3.03,5.3861,2.2902,0.7386,0.2718,2.4389,1.5964,2.3082,0.119,1.337,0.5067,0.0002,1.4432,1.9577,3.4379,3.9639,2.2016,4.1243,6.8694,0.0499,1.5389,4.087,6.4182,0.1712,0.0,0.3653,3.2964,1.2108,0.0007,1.3253,5.5866,0.5363,0.0014,0.0,1.1044,1.4363,0.0002,4.946,2.7959,2.5693,1.5409,1.3007,3.7927,3.893,2.5427,2.7627,1.3222,1.2089,0.7626,2.0041,1.3589,1.1331,0.1991,0.3273,4.3032,0.0048,0.0573,1.712,6.3753,0.4479,0.0171,1.0364,5.7848,0.0237,1.5279,0.1502,0.7721,0.2889,0.6601,0.2005,2.8823,0.1669,0.0996,0.2784,0.6891,0.0002,5.1986,1.0838,1.9397,2.8929,1.7776,1.415,3.5902,1.4962,6.4021,1.5793,4.9611,5.0344,0.446,0.005,0.4074,0.4811,0.0001,5.0741,0.065,0.0201,7.672,2.1514,5.9814,0.434,2.4606,4.0176,4.3929,1.1482,2.3792,2.7717,1.2548]}
{"id":4364,"ended":true,"length":564,"gen_text":"A planet's sea level changes drastically with the day and night cycle. When it's night, the ocean raises up thousands of feet. When it's day, not a drop of water can be seen.\n\n'It was only when the sun rose in the morning that we could see water because of the heat from the sun,' says Dr. Sze. 'The water in the ocean stays a lot lower during the night than it does during the day.'\n\nThere are no other land-based islands in Antarctica.\n\n'Antarctica is different because it is located far away from the North and the equator,' explains Dr. Sze. On the other hand, Antarctica is right above the equator on planet Earth.\n\nDr. Sze, with a team from University of Wisconsin, spent weeks studying the ocean floor with a remotely operated vessel.\n\nOnce the group pinpointed the exact position where the deep water rises, they used GPS technology to map what it looks like.\n\nIn one part, there is a big dark layer, which is a massive ocean floor.\n\nAt the bottom of the ocean, there is a thick layer of ice and on the outside of this, some water.\n\n\nIn another area, where the bottom of the ocean was covered by thick salt water, they found one of the largest icebergs ever recorded. The iceberg is about the size of Rhode Island.\n\nAfter their investigations, Dr. Sze believes Antarctica is the planet's largest mass of frozen water.\n\n\nTHE BOLT OF AGES\n\nThe ancient Antarctic continent was a huge island, known as Gondwana, which existed from about 550 million to 220 million years ago - the period known as the Paleogene. During this time, scientists believe Earth had been tilted toward the sun at an angle of about 17 degrees.\n\nGondwana became land of ice and is the area where ice giants such as Grosvenor, Murchison, and Ross will later develop.\n\n\nAbout 90 metres (295 ft) thick, Gondwana was made of ice - about 20 percent of Earth's total mass at the time.\n\nIt had an equatorial surface and the land of Antarctica did not exist.\n\nThe Antarctic ice caps also do not yet exist, but Dr. Sze believes there were a series of events that drove the ice sheet to its present distance today.\n\n'We now know that it happened when the climate became warmer, so more light entered the atmosphere, which caused land ice to move higher and higher away from the poles,' says Dr. Sze.\n\n'As the ice became thicker, it held back the warmer ocean so that more water could escape from its surface. The ice then began to move ever closer to the oceans, thus creating an atmosphere thick enough to hold enough air to keep the ice sheet stable.'\n\nAround 75 feet (23.5 m) thick, the Antarctic ice sheet is approximately twice today's amount of land ice in our planet's continental region. This is one of the largest sheets of solid ice in the world.","token_len":638,"entropy":[9.8172,2.8617,7.9546,0.6316,3.9152,5.6889,3.1395,1.2426,7.3356,2.2975,1.6098,1.0903,0.7597,3.5212,2.2001,1.1171,3.1423,0.7899,0.8042,2.5285,6.4669,2.5272,9.4593,0.0164,0.2139,1.9134,0.86,0.0971,0.029,0.0916,0.0403,9.0736,2.7225,0.982,0.5387,0.2499,2.1726,1.716,0.199,0.851,1.4951,0.0014,6.9965,2.5755,2.9556,4.45,1.1685,2.0646,2.6856,1.5694,1.8993,0.1071,0.6236,0.3882,1.2564,1.4619,0.2633,4.2173,6.5339,2.028,0.3491,4.9347,2.3881,0.1081,0.6653,1.5515,2.1619,3.1718,0.9382,5.1267,5.5575,0.9965,1.5616,2.1029,1.9458,3.705,0.298,2.0908,4.8494,4.4899,0.9104,1.8999,2.3119,0.1771,1.5259,1.3832,0.9135,0.1023,0.3078,0.0246,0.0217,0.8436,0.1324,0.0002,5.3654,0.8336,3.9677,3.9371,4.644,1.2841,0.0618,3.9247,0.8728,3.0756,1.408,2.0647,0.0002,2.0536,3.6802,0.0109,0.0108,0.3611,5.7451,2.8356,0.8095,1.3894,5.2237,3.1844,0.8596,0.0623,0.445,5.5925,0.6489,4.1187,3.1775,0.0083,0.6843,1.8963,0.3853,0.0412,0.2208,0.0021,0.0481,8.7886,0.8704,0.3956,0.1654,0.031,2.5917,0.5446,5.5444,3.7474,0.1632,1.323,0.0133,3.5139,7.0221,0.0884,0.5674,0.5769,0.0002,4.1364,0.0754,0.1276,0.0013,3.5607,4.1866,3.0241,0.5846,2.0835,4.3291,0.1944,4.3587,1.4516,5.2456,5.6613,2.4668,0.624,4.0251,1.7439,2.9357,1.4786,1.2543,0.0695,5.5288,1.1055,0.7092,0.0002,5.5729,1.3325,6.2933,5.6024,0.0008,0.5213,1.6965,3.236,2.9123,0.4037,5.8936,1.4558,4.026,1.5251,0.3623,2.8083,4.9234,2.1926,0.1562,1.6826,5.2865,4.175,0.7559,0.0032,1.027,0.2647,0.0003,4.1916,3.5984,2.8169,3.0502,3.9445,0.9833,0.5918,4.1819,4.9626,5.9005,2.1158,1.2853,0.9932,3.0027,5.169,4.1443,1.0024,1.1278,0.8581,0.0002,4.5078,0.4484,0.6378,0.4483,0.7847,1.9102,0.6667,0.9079,0.4626,0.5606,3.416,0.4793,0.065,1.8267,2.9992,5.1187,1.7862,4.8018,0.8209,1.4602,2.0395,6.2617,3.1878,1.6374,4.5403,0.0003,3.5337,1.4062,2.3491,0.1937,3.7302,0.5521,4.477,0.639,0.0215,0.3161,3.2007,3.3314,0.8239,3.3898,5.9769,0.5753,0.1373,2.0636,0.5327,5.7492,0.9708,0.0943,1.762,2.5439,0.0089,0.5881,0.7724,0.564,3.4886,1.5098,0.9555,1.8175,1.7634,0.2087,0.0031,3.4171,0.0051,0.6463,0.5522,0.0002,5.3555,4.674,5.3403,0.1799,2.0172,0.0726,0.0377,0.0009,2.6315,3.488,0.9919,2.0932,5.4412,0.1073,1.2486,4.7406,0.7411,2.2901,0.1735,0.4683,1.3975,0.0003,5.8292,3.8068,4.8266,1.1019,1.1078,4.7091,1.9802,1.4569,0.0002,1.5049,4.5684,2.809,1.3864,1.3804,3.1962,3.1263,3.611,1.9435,4.6147,0.3128,1.8938,0.0011,0.0893,0.4972,1.5423,2.8159,2.4753,1.2978,4.7161,0.132,0.6641,4.4217,0.0041,0.0042,0.0117,4.9832,2.5169,3.3779,2.5206,0.0144,0.0528,2.5101,0.9273,0.4286,4.7599,0.3442,0.2211,0.1384,5.1075,0.2294,5.1236,3.4291,4.0506,5.3988,2.7046,0.0614,0.3607,4.7823,0.9919,0.2176,0.2906,0.835,4.2442,0.3263,0.5397,0.8139,0.0002,2.8438,0.0052,0.0189,4.054,4.5795,5.021,1.5847,0.7931,6.1276,2.9956,4.5507,1.71,3.9224,4.5276,1.1703,0.0017,2.2662,5.333,0.5424,0.0002,0.8689,5.3106,1.5463,0.0007,0.8392,0.9756,2.519,6.2318,2.5935,4.4956,0.2407,1.6933,0.0003,4.663,3.5194,6.6553,1.2871,0.8271,1.9636,0.0507,0.4422,0.2334,1.0375,0.0021,0.0192,1.1722,3.4293,1.3246,2.3326,4.2312,3.2671,4.0432,2.3246,0.3373,1.5472,0.0162,0.4895,1.9732,1.7855,0.5814,0.0141,0.2206,0.9773,0.0002,2.2731,3.3416,2.1768,4.0666,0.4387,4.0679,1.5585,3.8845,4.2263,3.8843,1.08,5.7849,0.0113,1.1967,0.7251,0.852,0.0002,1.6986,3.5596,1.7481,3.3033,5.0353,5.118,0.0027,3.1217,0.3865,1.607,0.9382,5.2173,0.1928,0.0718,0.0013,0.8293,3.3156,2.463,3.3678,2.3466,0.0024,4.4711,0.6782,5.2768,0.8267,1.6344,2.8205,1.371,2.7888,0.5676,6.6538,3.7644,0.1292,0.5463,0.0002,1.4363,2.2244,4.4939,0.495,0.2963,4.0064,3.9214,2.7314,0.7308,3.9653,2.2657,1.6069,2.0865,3.7795,4.2659,4.7437,4.3989,0.1712,0.5454,1.3608,1.641,2.2726,6.5578,2.0903,0.1055,4.0813,4.7903,1.7051,0.7072,4.5196,0.0113,0.182,2.6568,0.2631,0.9678,0.1501,0.0602,0.009,0.0009,0.0271,0.5578,0.0002,1.1035,3.5813,0.6149,0.9374,3.9936,0.9939,0.3883,0.8013,4.5559,2.7413,0.5878,3.3158,1.9469,6.2042,1.1677,3.1072,1.3557,0.7344,2.8616,2.6371,4.6765,3.0157,1.3135,2.7458,2.1992,2.2221,2.5307,0.1028,3.8217,5.2743,1.7297,0.0528,0.0865,3.1017,1.0312,4.6612,2.6139,2.8899,5.1662,4.2157,0.1389,0.1046,2.1023,4.2701,4.4028,0.7177,1.9984,0.3517,1.2021,3.299,2.1853,0.2741,0.3454,0.0002,5.9494,4.7594,4.969,0.2459,0.3587,2.3643,1.2746,0.5281,0.0307,0.3331,0.1671,0.7774,2.2291,0.0981,0.3289,0.8211,4.9583,2.6266,7.316,0.0034,4.4227,0.8475,1.2299,1.3501,2.7058,5.0447,0.8163,0.5758,4.0721,3.9131,0.1574,4.8592,1.3877,4.4987,0.1792,0.0875,1.4392,3.3222,0.1112,4.8228,0.1397,1.1829,0.1108,0.2134,0.3416]}
{"id":4349,"ended":true,"length":617,"gen_text":"It's normal for parents to leave a list of rules for the babysitter. It's also normal for some of those rules to be strange. What isn't normal is those rules being as ominous as these.\n\nIn one of the most heartbreaking lines of the interview (it's really great too), he says:\n\n'So let me give you the answer, okay? There are two rules: one is you can never talk to anybody. Two, you can never let her touch you. If she touches you.\n\nHe says it with such heart and with such conviction. Because if it's okay to talk to your neighbor, you have to let your kids talk to their neighbor. There's a reason that he mentions never letting her touch you, since children who do see their babysitters are at increased risk for sexual abuse:\n\n\"Children tend to know their parents' jobs, so they probably pick up some stuff about it from them, but it's really the parents, it's the siblings who will get it, and there's so much stuff about the parents, about making sure things are done the right way... \"You know, there's this whole idea that if you feel unsafe, you shouldn't go to a babysitter. But that's a really dangerous idea. That's a really dangerous idea, to give children that message, because they feel safer if their parents are there to help them. It's a scary place to be. So the two ways you can ensure your kids feel safe is if the babysitter has got two rules: one is that you can never talk to anybody, that you can never let her touch you. And then if she does touch you? If she touches you, you have to let her go. You have to let her leave, okay?\"\n\nBut that's not my rule. It's not at all what my parents taught us when we were young. So, in an absolutely shocking move, Kelly gives his six month old son this new rule:\n\n\"But it's just a rule for now, and he's gonna have it until he's fourteen.\"\n\nThat makes me furious. If your child, or any child, says: \"I'm only taking two steps because I can't have any more,\" I am absolutely right there with you.\n\nThere's absolutely no reason for a parent to force their child to go to a babysitter who has these bizarre rules, if the child's goal is to make sure their safety.\n\nIf you can't make the choice to let your child, or any child, talk to a babysitter who follows these guidelines, I think it's worth asking if it's even that big of a decision at all, given what we know about the role of children in sexual abuse. We should all be able to agree that talking is better than keeping a child from having a conversation at all: \"I'm sorry, I have to go.\"\n\nAs a mother, I think that no child - and particularly no child under six months - should ever be asked by a parent to set boundaries, or enforce them in any way.","token_len":638,"entropy":[0.9077,7.48,1.1782,4.6151,0.1647,6.1447,2.6676,7.8716,0.1364,4.6935,1.3619,2.7263,6.7519,0.0535,1.4554,2.9022,0.3903,1.9678,0.2334,0.3256,5.4195,1.739,1.0425,0.0661,0.0489,0.6774,5.69,1.3864,4.8375,4.1883,0.0004,0.0506,0.2834,7.0164,0.6056,1.3497,7.0711,9.4408,0.4272,2.8941,1.1882,0.5948,0.0021,3.8695,3.2907,1.582,0.4324,1.7287,5.1605,5.411,1.1657,0.4126,5.4627,4.0804,3.9893,0.6571,3.9358,5.3158,4.0947,0.5135,3.7331,1.4947,1.2271,0.3889,0.0002,4.3833,4.2443,4.9829,0.6439,3.6775,0.0579,2.2611,5.2485,2.6121,4.1908,0.363,3.8226,1.3281,2.4053,1.7821,1.8686,1.4501,0.6277,2.4596,2.0123,2.7241,3.2246,0.7089,3.3837,2.3664,3.4068,1.2128,0.6908,0.3827,0.4412,4.2674,4.5833,1.7164,0.7869,0.9272,3.2535,1.2758,0.7261,0.0496,5.3384,4.595,0.0002,3.7358,3.267,2.6336,2.2092,0.7425,4.9147,2.041,3.2621,0.0892,1.8781,1.1529,5.1526,3.2516,3.2467,1.0502,2.284,0.6743,3.275,0.3251,1.1497,5.0293,1.3534,3.9797,2.6175,0.2252,2.0188,0.3814,3.7529,3.3905,0.0414,0.6441,1.2141,0.4259,4.3134,0.596,2.2171,1.8736,2.1994,5.1729,5.6553,5.5946,1.2333,0.8951,0.026,0.3699,1.7184,6.1956,4.9849,4.1398,3.4022,6.6707,0.6168,3.2904,2.1832,3.0178,3.5248,3.1147,0.0116,0.69,1.1903,0.2991,5.7405,0.8657,0.0002,2.9305,4.2284,5.4172,0.0284,5.0089,1.488,1.6596,2.3545,5.6559,1.5906,1.6478,0.9405,5.9286,5.7217,0.3306,4.181,4.86,2.1064,2.4083,1.6075,1.9248,2.0299,2.1997,2.349,0.2547,3.2279,3.7185,1.8247,3.4376,2.9975,0.038,0.781,5.8246,3.4587,4.7863,3.6428,2.1524,2.5627,1.069,4.6195,0.4806,3.8758,0.6342,2.9719,2.1413,3.0351,2.5723,2.2873,2.9303,6.7405,0.9259,4.3757,0.2028,2.0838,2.1794,0.3691,0.0073,5.8353,4.482,2.8559,1.8152,0.4391,2.8628,0.4892,3.0916,2.1637,3.6455,0.8526,2.0756,0.7099,5.7169,3.5876,0.8721,0.9378,2.6222,0.0007,1.4904,1.2412,1.7609,1.0675,0.0097,0.871,2.0143,2.4527,0.3251,2.5564,2.087,1.9138,1.3787,0.8455,3.3217,0.3638,1.6428,0.5544,0.3327,0.6051,2.2331,3.7929,4.9483,2.7922,0.8157,1.9821,2.0286,1.8556,1.7524,4.8413,3.4422,2.1439,2.3086,0.1286,0.8157,2.3627,2.228,2.8758,0.2985,1.0131,3.1898,0.3994,2.0436,4.5148,3.1958,0.2906,0.1581,1.9233,2.8912,3.0144,3.7898,7.3493,1.7301,0.4045,5.3683,1.5753,1.1727,2.2397,0.1257,0.6821,2.5198,3.4807,0.9393,0.0329,3.8689,5.6449,4.384,1.1627,1.0981,0.3816,0.2536,2.629,0.5472,0.2833,0.5487,0.2041,0.027,0.1457,0.6857,4.8782,1.1475,0.1318,0.1211,0.5105,0.2547,0.017,0.0235,0.9585,0.735,2.8972,2.8699,0.426,1.3276,0.4292,0.0078,5.9762,2.7018,0.249,0.6794,0.0725,0.3955,0.8577,2.0332,0.1389,3.3421,0.0697,0.848,0.7037,2.4115,0.8197,0.0239,1.5599,0.079,3.0282,2.2572,2.9408,1.6696,0.0717,0.0002,4.8336,2.8973,0.4097,0.5843,6.5677,3.5341,0.4146,2.8897,0.2078,0.9534,6.053,0.017,1.1907,2.526,1.1347,0.5817,3.3355,3.678,0.3711,0.3089,2.0546,0.2276,4.2583,2.8328,3.4711,3.2218,6.6932,3.7297,1.7838,0.1336,6.7644,5.6109,1.7673,6.151,4.816,0.1475,1.9766,4.3946,4.8712,0.3008,0.6272,0.3363,0.0002,0.4857,4.0075,3.6926,0.3735,4.1663,1.755,1.1319,2.5027,1.4254,1.2308,2.4389,3.5247,0.8091,2.7917,1.0167,3.7715,1.8122,0.3439,0.4509,5.6274,1.5886,0.0707,0.0001,3.2066,4.9726,1.5571,3.5663,0.2734,4.4396,3.2686,1.3218,5.4605,1.9977,1.2747,0.4424,0.4311,4.4648,4.5021,0.716,0.9403,1.4053,3.8727,5.995,3.6918,0.9112,3.8985,0.4654,2.9581,0.1267,5.383,2.6278,0.2034,1.0534,3.2008,3.9315,4.0164,4.189,0.4191,0.083,0.1677,0.1579,2.2503,0.0002,4.341,1.2449,3.7539,0.5213,0.7968,1.4191,1.2651,1.0996,0.0668,4.3241,0.9278,0.677,0.1517,3.5594,1.6024,1.0059,0.2255,0.0078,2.9866,2.1187,3.0999,3.156,0.2286,2.4596,5.2644,2.5044,0.9914,3.899,5.5031,0.2111,0.2838,3.2312,0.6177,1.5449,3.2393,0.9468,1.4372,0.0002,3.3931,1.2834,3.6236,0.484,3.6821,2.7585,2.3286,1.0191,1.9141,0.1939,0.5394,5.2432,0.4427,0.6426,0.2122,0.0963,2.7882,0.108,1.2742,0.5323,0.0009,1.5277,5.153,0.3864,3.7862,0.1101,2.1727,3.5894,1.1841,0.1634,3.8504,1.5253,3.2462,3.0558,0.2788,2.5376,6.6194,2.688,0.3204,0.0348,3.2928,2.3635,0.0448,3.1591,3.3283,2.775,1.4992,0.4888,0.1095,1.0904,5.1291,0.423,2.9906,0.3446,1.5625,0.1472,0.2996,4.4036,4.1521,1.8543,0.5442,2.0814,0.016,1.1881,0.2224,4.7614,4.035,2.6272,0.0319,5.2293,1.92,1.2917,2.0238,3.4362,1.0857,2.2981,4.0019,0.0323,4.4844,6.072,1.8011,1.2445,2.8104,0.3907,1.0102,2.555,0.2123,0.8441,3.2779,0.6032,0.0002,4.1263,1.9016,2.9873,0.6799,0.4337,3.2327,2.2235,5.806,2.0406,6.0704,2.9981,3.887,0.7584,0.7054,0.9461,0.8909,2.7902,1.0337,0.1182,0.9612,0.4376,3.3887,3.9454,0.4353,0.3077,0.3682,5.7387,2.2789,2.5888,1.5518,5.0748,1.4816,3.3759,0.5454,0.108,0.2899]}

renovated.","token_len":640,"entropy":[6.4644,1.2722,8.0798,8.4134,2.848,0.0937,5.0975,3.1553,3.4634,8.3272,4.4466,2.9055,0.4924,3.1007,1.2508,6.2317,0.5477,0.5805,6.374,0.2277,4.6603,5.2691,1.5386,2.2772,2.4866,3.1948,1.2938,3.6849,6.0642,2.9304,0.5492,2.0827,2.7945,5.4988,1.1813,0.865,0.0099,7.645,0.5085,0.539,0.8297,2.1486,0.014,1.391,2.8868,1.9949,3.6875,1.32,4.9987,1.0544,1.5406,5.5561,0.5001,0.893,2.3348,0.7441,3.2733,0.0001,0.6379,2.635,4.2855,4.1085,3.4458,3.4486,2.5545,1.4193,4.1666,1.1152,3.7897,2.9034,2.0535,1.4994,0.9425,0.0001,6.4767,1.1379,0.6415,5.2723,0.1167,3.3019,0.6074,4.6717,0.5868,1.6047,5.1591,6.0355,2.7036,2.3975,0.9462,0.3834,5.5978,1.0643,5.4922,0.5264,1.9028,0.3921,1.7637,4.3003,5.3664,0.1728,3.0994,5.0964,1.4263,1.8986,5.0667,0.0253,4.6372,2.0056,1.8031,2.5489,2.0869,0.0208,0.4851,4.9854,0.0002,0.4106,1.8359,1.7843,3.7544,1.6151,1.7414,3.8291,1.3886,1.3928,5.2175,2.5946,5.813,6.0039,6.3798,4.8504,0.4071,3.5143,3.1525,0.003,3.485,4.3214,0.0886,0.3716,2.3414,1.5232,0.7793,2.7043,0.0002,0.2822,2.9356,2.8383,0.0433,0.0043,2.8037,2.3181,0.5934,0.2951,1.6356,0.7549,4.9558,1.3595,3.096,3.3396,3.2798,3.005,3.7553,4.426,5.6001,1.7266,0.0006,0.1852,1.0433,2.2707,0.4757,0.0026,3.1683,0.827,0.1195,0.8765,2.9278,1.3631,4.4696,0.0064,2.5478,6.401,0.7191,0.0024,0.0001,4.7815,3.3066,3.2417,0.0056,1.041,4.3034,2.3115,1.221,2.1049,4.9369,0.1296,1.6008,0.8805,0.9423,5.0356,3.3191,0.3553,0.1356,1.063,0.0002,0.2719,1.4838,0.3922,0.0027,2.8518,1.1289,0.6418,1.0228,2.7123,3.5371,2.6871,1.2837,0.1967,0.2408,1.0959,0.0009,0.0001,1.8052,2.4777,2.1203,2.3159,1.8805,6.05,3.1757,0.331,2.9149,0.3687,0.2314,0.6978,0.7798,1.1376,0.0002,0.3142,1.7068,1.108,5.1231,4.0871,0.0001,0.8488,0.5719,3.3634,0.8363,3.7332,4.5507,3.3894,1.2514,0.9001,3.7906,0.6606,0.1814,1.4312,0.0003,0.1749,2.5254,4.2196,0.5208,4.061,5.1961,2.2663,0.1114,4.0443,1.4536,1.0787,0.4427,5.0535,0.2359,6.072,1.0778,4.0856,3.8524,1.9199,4.7883,3.5219,0.9761,0.7272,6.9003,1.3998,2.1956,5.2571,0.1926,2.3655,0.428,0.3722,2.7666,0.1386,2.6572,0.9168,2.8122,3.041,0.5713,2.2741,1.1551,0.7133,3.2849,0.7608,2.0723,0.2097,0.5905,0.0002,0.2211,1.9508,5.9936,5.8903,4.8781,5.4429,0.2137,1.5375,1.1375,0.8551,4.0348,2.9249,5.088,1.5197,0.0534,2.7931,4.7455,2.7232,5.7858,5.0654,2.5193,2.1569,0.8534,2.068,2.6413,1.0933,0.8939,0.3658,4.331,0.7569,1.1058,0.7948,5.2472,2.1145,5.2735,5.3634,3.1006,1.1268,0.0735,2.2003,0.7377,0.3321,1.3034,0.4367,0.179,0.5959,0.0002,0.2667,1.8006,2.3706,5.4802,1.1377,2.3787,6.7173,5.6246,0.7646,1.1696,2.3146,5.4093,1.9804,1.9005,1.7095,3.3277,0.4245,0.4265,0.9077,1.5897,0.7169,4.3233,1.8803,1.9117,3.501,0.0238,1.5506,1.7499,2.1011,1.64,1.0208,0.524,0.0003,0.3492,1.4163,2.8949,3.0428,6.2524,0.1541,3.6238,0.6905,3.973,4.3329,6.7289,1.884,1.1913,4.616,1.9048,4.8446,2.5046,2.2927,5.3652,3.2561,0.0721,1.4833,3.0922,2.7429,3.4401,2.4806,4.9995,2.4261,5.5172,3.0753,0.3321,3.9832,0.8152,2.3521,2.1986,2.3408,4.4903,1.078,0.0774,0.7377,2.7461,2.0964,1.2303,4.3344,5.2458,0.567,0.9552,5.7411,0.0327,3.1473,3.1758,0.1121,2.356,0.5382,0.7226,0.0003,4.8546,1.4626,3.1381,1.5706,0.5406,4.5635,1.9425,2.2697,0.7545,4.8194,4.3446,4.3436,1.5118,4.8304,1.2692,3.5685,3.4941,3.2155,1.738,5.6683,4.7605,2.158,0.3346,4.0441,4.3408,2.1533,4.7309,3.7293,0.5044,0.6465,4.9264,6.2124,5.3501,0.7705,5.7188,4.3589,0.4583,3.8882,4.7665,3.1511,1.7982,0.1305,3.3411,0.976,1.4106,1.9243,4.7185,1.1131,4.0993,1.4323,4.4916,0.755,5.7458,2.3085,4.2693,0.4022,0.2084,0.5693,0.0002,0.707,1.9214,3.2956,4.1457,4.1248,1.7152,0.9172,3.8777,3.3037,0.7885,3.5917,0.0664,0.8311,2.5373,2.0525,5.8044,0.5726,5.0484,2.2291,2.04,2.8995,0.7339,0.2077,1.0555,0.0033,1.3354,4.4083,0.2099,0.6574,0.9675,4.1621,0.5518,3.1319,1.9737,4.3143,0.8445,0.8775,1.6015,3.8286,0.937,3.6675,0.9085,0.968,0.8943,5.782,0.6404,0.931,0.0003,0.4818,3.4217,2.7116,0.1852,1.0737,4.5061,1.6586,3.5302,6.0704,1.9915,3.1838,5.5076,0.0436,0.6972,0.0611,4.2647,2.4987,0.6615,3.5928,0.668,1.1164,1.4574,0.7093,1.2071,0.0003,0.4772,5.15,5.3619,0.0615,0.0039,0.6496,1.4524,4.3935,1.7437,0.7407,5.3418,0.0353,3.4821,0.7779,0.4738,1.3681,0.4449,0.3973,0.3041,2.2484,1.5197,0.6694,0.372,1.5753,0.2354,0.8425,1.2924,0.0003,2.4671,1.3863,1.967,0.6067,4.399,2.8931,1.4881,0.3056,2.4514,3.2614,5.0456,1.0634,2.933,2.5284,0.0092,0.5365,0.2154,0.6835,3.2164,2.181,1.8388,0.8691,1.279,0.7256,2.7801,0.4731,0.3779,0.3465,2.5482,1.7221,1.8828,3.413,0.8381,0.457,0.0854,0.4302,6.2362,1.5807,4.3015,3.1065,0.4262]}
{"id":1494,"ended":false,"length":597,"gen_text":"What would it be like if whales meandered about on land instead of swimming in the sea?\n\nIs it possible in the future to walk on the moon?\n\nDo you dream in the shower? How would you feel if you could look in a mirror?\n\nCan you talk to your computer like you talk with another person?\n\nWho are you and where do you live?\n\nThis is an experiment in a computer-based artificial intelligence programming language. This course will teach you how to make your own programs that have an understanding of you. (For more details about the AI programming language I will be using, click here ).\n\nI will be teaching this course on Udacity, which is a platform where students can try out their programming skills using small assignments. (You can learn more about this amazing platform here ). Students can enroll in this course from anywhere in the world.\n\nIn this course, there are assignments using programming language Python.\n\nThe assignments will give you problems you have to address in a given time period. I will also include exercises on how to solve these problems in a programming language like Python. If you fail to solve your assignments you can refer to tutorials where you can find help through the forums and Google. The courses will last from 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on your knowledge level. At the end of the course, you will have had a taste of my work.\n\nWhy enroll in this course?\n\nI believe as intelligent beings we can design a machine that can understand us like we will understand it and use that intelligence to create art, music, design, technology and so on.\n\nThis course will help you build a program that I call a \"Humanoid AI\". It will be able to respond to questions that I gave to it. It is my goal to teach you how to build this intelligent machine that will have the same mind I have.\n\nWhat is Python?\n\nPython is one of the most widely used programming languages, written in C. Python makes it easier for people to write their own programs. A program is a sequence of statements that can include many variables and commands (such as import statement). Python also has an important built-in library called the standard library. The library contains millions of functions, classes and packages that can be used to make your programs more efficient. You will learn about these library packages and variables during the course.

{"id":2250,"ended":false,"length":625,"gen_text":"You're watching a kid '' s show about chemistry. However, the mix of chemicals seems awfully explosive... especially when mixed with that strange drug known as C4... (it's really a form of hydrochloric acid)... But let'' s get to the interesting details that are really what makes this show interesting. As you can see, C4 has effects that are similar to heroin... and its effects on the body is so powerful, it can even affect people with immunity to heroin... and it actually has a very intense effect... (the reaction we see is pretty powerful ) So how can this show be legal? I think because it'' s only dealing with a drug, with a drug the government has given an okay to... so we can`t expect the government to say that a show that is about drugs like C4 is against the law, can it? So the question is why and how can C4 be legal, and there are many reasons why we can`t expect the government to give illegal drugs such as heroin a legal status.. First, there is the law on C4.... This drug is not on a Controlled Substance list, and as you can see from your own drug test (I tested positive twice for drugs, one after using some C4, which is not on the list), so there is no reason for a government to say that C4 drugs are illegal and treat them like something that we can`t touch... (the only reason given for this position by the government is that C4 is a synthetic drug, and like many synthetic substances, it''s less harmful than heroin.. but if we talk about drugs as substances we can touch, then you have a problem with this reasoning I feel ). Secondly, drugs like C4 are in very short supply in the markets, and that means that the price is less than its worth. At this moment, one gram of this substance (2.4 grams or 0.6 mg) is about $13 with a $10 minimum, and it will sell for $18.50 in the end (plus, it was $12 when I tested positive). So the drug companies can sell at very low cost to the consumers. So again, the value you''ll be charged for one gram of this substance is low, but the cost to the consumers for a gram can be very high... the consumer is paying $15. That is really why this kind of drugs are less dangerous than real heroin... because they don''t have to pay a high high cost for a gram of that drug. Finally, these kinds of drugs are often used by drug addicts and users of more dangerous drugs (if it''s cheaper than the more dangerous alternatives), and for some reason we can't argue that these drugs are not dangerous... so obviously we don''t need to look for a reason why this drug is legal. This show does a great job showing the world a good thing about a drug and a terrible thing in the same time... (I like how he goes against the drug companies to make this show about the drug and not how it is made).\nPosted by Andrew Juskow at 8:05 PM","token_len":641,"entropy":[2.1942,6.3356,3.572,6.1145,13.9869,7.7872,5.8026,4.6161,8.5905,1.3459,7.2569,0.1518,1.8014,8.27,1.6008,3.3309,5.4481,5.97,6.2882,4.6089,5.9572,0.8455,4.456,0.625,5.6446,4.4149,6.5384,3.6203,0.0468,6.2646,1.9404,3.0787,4.2298,5.7947,0.7847,3.8499,2.2234,3.8423,0.0333,5.9366,0.5644,0.0106,0.0077,5.4993,4.2187,6.1539,5.1997,0.0284,3.0958,1.1215,0.3293,4.3082,6.2894,5.7184,2.7128,3.4024,3.2789,1.6227,0.3287,0.7839,2.4437,0.7699,4.531,1.6252,1.5743,0.3277,0.7702,3.8437,0.0274,2.5838,6.5136,1.366,0.92,2.3785,0.0392,4.5275,2.1423,2.4896,4.8528,1.0206,2.9676,0.771,1.5741,2.908,4.1634,2.407,1.7883,1.586,1.0838,1.9284,3.9614,2.6073,3.2427,5.2274,0.9357,0.8403,1.5211,2.4416,2.3132,5.7707,2.6939,1.2601,2.511,5.268,1.6011,2.6876,2.8962,3.4168,5.3336,6.0965,0.7954,1.5857,3.7195,4.7174,6.7996,3.6956,3.3409,2.5234,1.7205,3.4751,1.1164,4.9512,0.4668,4.096,2.1692,5.6625,1.3019,0.5594,0.4999,4.7866,5.393,0.0342,1.5811,1.7534,2.7607,5.0508,1.014,1.895,5.3953,1.0164,1.4119,5.0132,3.6953,2.2405,0.5254,3.6579,2.7768,3.81,0.8135,5.349,0.0309,4.309,2.0741,1.4019,0.081,4.6172,2.1396,3.3206,0.6477,2.2034,2.2616,1.6877,2.2531,4.9057,2.4682,0.0021,0.8431,4.1255,0.2665,0.0354,2.6653,3.1392,1.7211,0.064,3.7646,2.849,1.9409,0.6597,4.2546,6.0416,0.3587,1.952,3.2807,0.0063,0.1984,0.6744,2.952,1.3669,6.0532,0.6338,2.4777,1.822,1.8244,4.3162,0.6737,1.1192,0.0536,0.9846,0.4455,0.1205,0.0497,2.9651,6.7625,0.2764,2.9536,2.3062,2.2342,1.8007,0.9434,0.4893,5.2994,3.2255,1.7675,2.6259,0.8541,0.9861,4.7758,2.5845,3.7599,0.0095,3.826,4.1916,1.5644,0.4967,2.5185,4.5049,3.5164,5.6361,0.6674,0.6662,1.0933,1.6172,3.1523,3.4237,0.4326,0.1009,1.4526,7.4492,2.3989,2.8647,1.3892,3.8942,3.925,4.6591,0.9281,4.207,1.2228,3.0256,1.6307,2.6635,4.2956,2.1336,5.0926,1.302,0.0039,1.2456,5.0637,1.4871,2.6325,2.2269,0.7862,0.4614,1.6888,3.8583,2.8968,0.2852,0.3908,2.2218,1.6813,2.8178,1.9929,0.3547,2.472,0.6197,1.1696,0.0025,6.6392,0.3081,0.3963,4.2376,5.0341,0.5415,1.3768,4.9655,1.5345,3.7323,0.7025,0.2001,0.0181,5.3205,1.4734,2.9332,3.2226,3.0262,0.9051,5.4549,1.1827,1.6368,6.3761,2.9255,0.1714,0.4719,0.3411,0.3903,1.4863,0.0027,0.7643,1.3427,4.0002,0.875,0.807,1.2178,5.6114,2.6773,0.9883,4.7478,0.4213,0.8627,3.7239,0.3079,5.3776,2.0111,0.3658,2.048,4.5325,1.9715,3.9973,2.275,5.7254,0.0754,3.5354,3.1638,3.3213,3.6806,0.2075,1.6285,0.4828,1.0929,4.1968,2.753,2.7764,2.1092,1.4323,1.5797,4.2413,6.6265,4.9415,5.0788,3.0698,0.0714,5.3841,1.642,0.3827,0.0017,0.6998,4.7863,4.1564,2.591,0.0031,2.7514,0.7466,6.8857,1.4674,0.9969,4.1688,1.9859,0.8442,1.8124,2.4949,0.8939,5.5173,0.4513,4.2196,1.453,1.7806,5.8276,2.1411,2.3013,0.5005,4.4351,0.8238,0.1461,4.1265,3.3228,3.4343,5.6142,0.5761,1.5699,0.5353,4.4276,3.2536,0.0136,3.1483,5.8845,0.5923,1.023,3.2025,0.5559,4.4005,6.4457,1.8617,1.783,2.3977,2.8857,2.1277,0.805,2.6098,3.538,3.107,0.176,1.0469,3.347,2.6422,2.1908,3.3757,1.2416,3.8911,1.9406,5.3813,4.4667,2.1243,4.7314,1.7961,2.435,2.2324,0.1937,1.2327,1.88,1.6151,1.6183,2.2885,2.586,4.8046,2.282,2.0666,4.2857,4.1236,0.518,3.5314,2.5978,1.0641,3.8878,2.3947,3.3087,5.3175,0.1106,1.4161,6.1436,5.7285,3.8458,1.0709,2.9456,5.0227,0.5262,3.7787,0.0576,0.6357,0.6693,1.3402,0.442,3.5689,0.847,1.868,1.4187,2.9066,1.6223,0.9585,3.2229,3.8717,2.4179,1.0767,4.2825,0.2584,0.9581,0.1762,1.5774,4.0945,4.4981,1.9833,1.0758,2.4214,3.0757,2.6063,7.944,1.8099,4.6113,3.1517,2.0619,5.4025,0.0042,1.7827,1.1599,5.2295,2.5174,0.3075,5.9703,0.4788,1.529,2.4926,1.9586,3.2431,0.024,0.1697,0.6221,2.0238,2.5594,2.6959,1.8807,7.0402,2.0764,1.2737,1.2396,0.6727,0.7232,5.5283,0.9009,1.0838,3.5083,0.0557,4.8023,2.9662,0.0071,0.0841,0.539,4.3483,1.5797,1.1692,2.3647,0.7765,2.5174,3.9319,3.3912,5.9096,0.3913,0.2473,2.8712,5.3422,3.0408,1.5497,0.1014,4.7384,1.6124,2.3645,1.5697,0.2925,5.5599,1.8849,1.0594,5.1612,3.773,1.5668,3.8421,1.2568,2.9043,5.5831,0.5541,2.9498,0.6333,0.4682,1.8861,1.524,1.6336,2.1151,6.0408,2.6022,2.7553,0.0151,0.0358,1.9849,0.6767,5.4808,1.3185,0.8962,0.8263,0.77,2.1635,1.195,0.8854,1.078,0.9647,4.128,1.7664,3.1839,2.4068,1.2685,0.0187,3.4095,1.2055,5.5385,4.087,4.301,3.3554,2.0212,2.9645,0.3329,3.4178,2.7692,3.3736,0.1603,5.9052,1.0184,0.6412,2.7521,1.2084,2.871,2.7488,4.17,1.6741,4.1681,4.5597,5.3174,0.537,3.4434,0.6157,2.8364,2.3742,1.3201,0.6675,3.4895,2.1794,1.5859,2.4376,0.3496,5.3043,1.1027,1.2422,2.425,1.2774,2.7395,3.0925,0.0016,5.8291,4.9972,6.6939,1.4378,0.7737,2.507,0.0349,4.0425,0.9443]}

I just couldn't bring myself to do it.\"\n\nThe judge sentenced Bowers to life in prison for the murder, and recommended Rumsfeld not be resentenced because he is innocent.\n\n\"You did not do [the killing] and you have not received a fair go in any way on what he did to us,\" Rumsfeld said. \"We're going to do our best to see that you are never able to set foot in America again.\"\n\nRumsfeld noted that Bowers was \"deeply remorseful\" about what he did, and apologized to the family.\n\nPraise for Rumsfeld's apology came from the families of some prisoners he had killed. \"You should be really proud of what you and the president have done,\" said Michael, of the Abu Ghraib jail.\n\nRumsfeld's defense attorneys have said his guilt in Rumsfeld's death is \"unquestionable.\" A defense motion for new trial said that the former defense secretary had acted in his duty when he allowed Rumsfeld to use the ranch for official business.\n\nThe defense also presented the findings of an investigation released by the Army chief of staff, Gen. John Allen. The inquiry determined that Rumsfeld \"was directly involved\" in the prison attack and that two days before the killing, the defense secretary had summoned Rumsfeld and CIA director George Tenet for a meeting to discuss \"security concerns\" related to the prison.\n\nThe inquiry found no evidence that anyone had deliberately tried to blame their boss in the case.\n\nRumsfeld is the highest-ranking U.S. official jailed since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. All military leaders have been accused of responsibility for war crimes or atrocities by the International Criminal Court during their time in power.\n\nRumsfeld's case was the second major jailbreak for a high-ranking U.S. official, after Navy commandant Adm. Richard Kuehl made three breakouts of the same prison in 1994. Former North Korean prisoners were sent back to North Korea after their escape from a North Korean prison camp in 2008.\n\n[With new trial, U.S. soldier gets pardon for Abu Ghraib killings]\n\nIn Bowers's death plea, he said the two CIA officials, working as \"a couple of guys in a trailer in the middle of the desert\" by themselves, were going to interrogate prisoners after they had been released from the prison. \"My role was to get them a little beer,\" he said.\n\nBy midnight, prison guards arrived there and opened fire, Bowers said.

The school is filled with students with no guidance. Every door is locked from the outside. You're terrified that they're coming to kill you... You need help!\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the screenplay that I created for the film, A Nightmare in Elmwood, a film that I hope to have completed and ready for distribution this Spring.\n\nThe movie ends with the following text.\n\nIt is a horrible night, and you wake up at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nA Nightmare in Elmwood\n\nThe above screenplay has been developed using the most contemporary techniques and sounds for a movie that looks and sounds like a movie, with a cast of characters that evoke an authentic feeling of horror.\n\nAs a concept, the screenplay is a great candidate for a film, provided that the producers and producers can provide the funding required to produce it and distribute it.\n\nIn order to produce and produce in a realistic and realistic manner, a studio will require some of the following:\n\n\u2022 $4,000 for a sound mixer\n\n\u2022 $2,000 for some new set construction\n\n\u2022 $2,000 for some new materials\n\n\u2022 $2,000 for a location manager\n\n\u2022 $1,500 for a makeup artist\n\n\u2022 $1,500 for wardrobe and hair designer\n\n\u2022 $500 for an editor\n\nAdditional funding will ensure the minimum order of the film necessary to provide a quality product as well as the production schedule that will enable us to get our film out into local and regional theaters in time for the Summer before graduating from high school and getting our college application together.\n\nThe final budget is comprised of the following:\n\n\u2022 $2,800 \u2013 Location fees\n\n\u2022 $3,000 \u2013 Production costs (we may need to hire extra cinematographer to capture the movie with the new high def camera I have. The cameras will cost $2,000 per camera when fully developed)\n\n\u2022 $2,000 \u2013 Production design\n\n\u2022 $2,250 \u2013 Food and lodging expenses\n\n\u2022 $2,250 \u2013 Distribution of the film\n\n\u2022 $2,250 \u2013 Music licensing fees\n\n\u2022 $2,125 \u2013 Insurance\n\nThe total budget is roughly 3 year's salary at a studio that has a maximum of 3 staff members working on their feature production. The higher the budget we can raise, the less we will be able, financially speaking, to spend on production, insurance, and distribution activities.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this

{"id":4785,"ended":false,"length":619,"gen_text":"Make me feel terrified of an entity without even describing what it is or looks like, nor how it works in the way that I would expect. The feeling of dread I am feeling when I read about alien abduction is real and visceral to me, and that's the impression I want to give readers. I have never felt so much terror and desire for escape from all realities and possibilities. The book is not designed to frighten the reader, it's designed to offer a glimpse into my life and the world that I live in. The aliens will always terrify me, but this one is different. I am terrified on a different level than any other species, with completely different ideas on what they want from us.\"\n\nWhen asked what she sees as the most important qualities the reader should keep in mind when reading the book, she replied, \"What really concerns me is that the books are not meant to be read as science fiction. They are about the realities of my life, things I lived with for 14 years, and things I learned along the way. I don't think it will shock anybody to learn that aliens exist, that they exist, that they are hostile, and very, very intelligent. The story is more about the everyday fear, the creeping dread that makes you question everything. For example: I went to a doctor after hearing a story about the strange sensation and feeling of being watched by my dead grandmother the other day. The feeling grew into a full blown panic as I watched the nurse's face trying to convince me it wasn't real, and it was only after I started to get itchy that my grandmother's memories finally returned. The point is you don't need to know what I know about aliens at my age; the story is about the everyday ways in which I am scared that my species is being harmed. No one should be scared of aliens. People should just believe the ones that they hear about. The only thing that interests me is that these stories are actually real.\"\n\n\nOne of the many things that makes the work so special is the way it not only captures the terror and desire for escape of being alien, but of the human condition too. I am absolutely thrilled to hear that you're not afraid to get your hands dirty with a book and try your hand at making your own book\u2026 and I think that's where the real beauty of it all lies\u2026. I really want to see more people get into creative book-making and writing. This book is so strong it even has it's own website to showcase that creation.\n\nAs long as there is such a thing as hope and optimism for more people to take steps for their own survival, I really believe this book should serve as just another piece of inspiration for so many people.\n\nThere's a lot written about \"the end of the world\" right now, but this book is the only one telling us that it's not yet time to pull the plug.\n\nFor more by Jessica Lea Davis, check out her website or follow her @jessicaeladavis!

The school is filled with students with no guidance. Every door is locked from the outside. You're terrified that they're coming to kill you... You need help!\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the screenplay that I created for the film, A Nightmare in Elmwood, a film that I hope to have completed and ready for distribution this Spring.\n\nThe movie ends with the following text.\n\nIt is a horrible night, and you wake up at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nA Nightmare in Elmwood\n\nThe above screenplay has been developed using the most contemporary techniques and sounds for a movie that looks and sounds like a movie, with a cast of characters that evoke an authentic feeling of horror.\n\nAs a concept, the screenplay is a great candidate for a film, provided that the producers and producers can provide the funding required to produce it and distribute it.\n\nIn order to produce and produce in a realistic and realistic manner, a studio will require some of the following:\n\n\u2022 $4,000 for a sound mixer\n\n\u2022 $2,000 for some new set construction\n\n\u2022 $2,000 for some new materials\n\n\u2022 $2,000 for a location manager\n\n\u2022 $1,500 for a makeup artist\n\n\u2022 $1,500 for wardrobe and hair designer\n\n\u2022 $500 for an editor\n\nAdditional funding will ensure the minimum order of the film necessary to provide a quality product as well as the production schedule that will enable us to get our film out into local and regional theaters in time for the Summer before graduating from high school and getting our college application together.\n\nThe final budget is comprised of the following:\n\n\u2022 $2,800 \u2013 Location fees\n\n\u2022 $3,000 \u2013 Production costs (we may need to hire extra cinematographer to capture the movie with the new high def camera I have. The cameras will cost $2,000 per camera when fully developed)\n\n\u2022 $2,000 \u2013 Production design\n\n\u2022 $2,250 \u2013 Food and lodging expenses\n\n\u2022 $2,250 \u2013 Distribution of the film\n\n\u2022 $2,250 \u2013 Music licensing fees\n\n\u2022 $2,125 \u2013 Insurance\n\nThe total budget is roughly 3 year's salary at a studio that has a maximum of 3 staff members working on their feature production. The higher the budget we can raise, the less we will be able, financially speaking, to spend on production, insurance, and distribution activities.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this

{"id":710,"ended":true,"length":624,"gen_text":"You slowly start to realize that all of your friends are undercover agents tasked with keeping you alive. Then, at your birthday party, with every friend surrounding you, the people trying to kill you finally find you.\n\nIn one short afternoon, you learn that you are one of the most dangerous people in the world, and that you are also one of those people you keep telling to yourself. This realization is hard to come by though, because you kept using your brain to convince yourself that all of your friends are actually good people.\n\nIn a moment of clarity, where everything you ever told yourself was actually true, you realize that your friends are being paid by you to try to kill you, and you realize that you have been using them all for your own benefit.\n\nYou realize this the hardest of all, because your friends are the best people you know, and your friends care a great deal about you. You have friends who have died trying to protect you, who your parents cared about and who you were lucky enough to have as friends. You have friends who have taken on jobs that have made some of the most difficult situations in your life more difficult, and who know you better than almost anyone on the entire planet.\n\nYou realize that you are the most dangerous person your entire life, and that your friends are the worst, because the best and the worst are also the two people you are the least confident about your own abilities.\n\nNow, there are a few ways you can deal with this:\n\n1) Be a coward and leave your friends, even if they are trying to kill you. Then you will never have to say you loved them again, and they will never have to know that you are afraid, and that you hate yourself. This will also avoid losing access to all of the drugs that your friends were able to buy for you at the very first party your parents gave you.\n\n2) Try to find another job. At this point, you will have learned enough about the business of selling drugs that you will have been able to get a good job doing it, and you won't have to trust people who might try to kill you, because you will know exactly when to expect them. Your new workplace will be in the very same city that you are starting to work in right now, and you should have absolutely no problem finding a job.\n\n3) Talk to your parents for a bit, make up a story, that you will tell them later to protect them from any kind of grief that might arise, and then flee with your body. Now you will never even have to learn about what actually happened that night.\n\nYour friends have betrayed you, manipulated you, and sold you out, and you should feel sad for that, but you really should not feel sorry for them. You should feel sad for losing your family and your friends, because your family members will never be able to love you again after your parents do this to them.\n\nAnd that's the part you need to feel sorry about, not your family.\n\nAnd since no one will ever love you again after this, it's time to start living.","token_len":646,"entropy":[11.0187,3.0136,0.2131,2.4717,0.6346,3.9382,1.1728,1.5858,2.3069,0.7748,10.241,1.5052,7.1957,0.092,2.9375,1.3804,2.7682,0.9173,4.7724,1.7959,4.0024,4.7407,3.3377,0.2131,0.136,7.4274,4.7642,4.0486,8.2303,0.0422,0.668,3.0463,6.1584,5.6083,0.0114,0.3427,0.0177,5.7251,3.9303,0.836,0.5432,1.5786,0.0064,3.7425,4.9152,5.8004,4.8097,0.3139,0.8548,2.6724,0.8029,1.53,0.941,3.1418,0.0446,0.6422,1.8248,1.4179,0.8759,0.6865,0.2215,0.2796,1.4357,0.6996,1.1108,1.375,1.2267,4.0976,1.8217,0.0182,5.1295,1.2255,3.7335,4.3775,2.3198,5.1474,4.853,3.7047,4.0446,3.9645,1.4453,4.4151,0.4277,2.1138,0.9266,6.1226,0.4063,0.863,1.1846,5.3186,5.5318,1.8378,4.8608,0.7141,2.3333,0.0623,0.4021,4.1013,0.5774,0.5122,0.1393,0.831,3.667,1.6321,0.5635,0.7505,1.0108,0.0002,3.368,2.5412,3.6372,0.282,1.4876,0.1447,7.2699,2.5531,2.2684,3.7461,3.6647,0.0473,1.2278,5.033,0.2329,0.0939,0.2961,0.8746,0.2797,2.3507,0.5863,0.6219,5.5018,3.1059,1.4078,4.4496,0.3543,3.8204,0.7013,0.267,0.0219,2.049,0.3518,1.7156,3.3394,0.3331,0.9253,2.338,1.4817,3.9727,1.1407,1.739,3.212,0.4988,0.0415,2.0041,0.2278,0.8748,0.0002,1.999,2.3316,4.0344,4.1579,2.8409,2.1859,0.2372,0.9828,0.4628,3.014,0.9514,1.2276,2.3916,4.0936,0.5857,0.8351,0.7244,1.0186,0.2339,3.5432,2.9445,4.9787,4.8467,2.4426,0.0014,0.1737,0.0668,0.2974,1.6944,2.7434,5.0362,0.9704,1.7826,3.3886,2.532,0.0157,1.0862,0.0287,0.4937,2.4189,6.5063,1.6885,5.3285,0.539,2.0425,1.2139,1.5073,3.7987,4.9101,0.2045,0.0058,1.6994,1.7485,0.7228,0.396,1.5307,0.6643,0.399,0.1541,1.414,4.6946,2.7865,2.5379,1.5285,2.5159,2.7132,7.4377,0.4852,1.04,0.9061,1.743,3.2503,0.7641,0.3451,0.0334,3.4994,2.8383,0.9378,0.7877,0.8392,6.0818,2.003,0.8735,0.0173,4.1973,0.1859,2.7094,0.5788,4.1351,0.0823,0.0642,0.4661,0.0002,1.1578,1.349,0.3778,1.0965,1.4698,1.896,1.5879,0.2132,0.1348,7.3218,2.57,0.0658,0.3881,0.3206,0.8481,2.5089,0.8062,0.5959,1.3009,2.1215,3.5936,2.9104,3.9289,3.2787,2.9783,0.3924,0.4115,0.7538,4.6157,1.2268,6.2719,0.8936,0.6593,2.5917,2.4082,1.5724,4.7326,1.4151,3.837,1.6019,1.4202,0.4152,0.699,0.0002,5.1769,0.8713,3.942,1.0564,1.6178,1.0837,1.871,1.2001,0.304,2.3672,0.0021,0.2323,2.6929,0.2417,0.0002,1.5866,1.4597,4.8989,2.6583,3.6242,1.5872,4.6639,1.8069,0.1457,2.9567,3.5162,0.7873,0.8011,1.1415,2.6141,0.0215,0.4181,0.0076,0.2018,5.9075,1.2093,1.6697,1.6897,1.029,0.6192,5.0865,1.514,5.0288,0.1742,1.2832,1.7088,0.9268,2.0099,0.2567,0.2824,0.4571,0.0235,2.589,1.3808,0.5139,2.0425,2.5919,4.4857,1.2822,1.2079,0.6621,4.1192,1.3085,0.6466,3.8614,1.8905,2.1406,5.796,5.7382,6.2545,0.0051,2.3897,0.2613,1.6222,4.1947,2.1339,2.486,0.2107,4.1158,4.7447,0.0028,2.9117,0.7844,0.0331,2.8686,0.8858,4.6234,3.8558,0.7231,5.3595,1.9399,4.1799,0.0144,0.5733,0.2904,0.0002,0.0639,0.002,3.1581,0.2508,3.1168,3.0827,3.4772,1.686,5.0965,1.2226,0.0429,0.3665,0.6761,2.0877,1.2787,3.7933,2.788,0.843,1.2716,4.7365,0.942,3.4469,0.3819,1.345,0.2674,0.8656,2.4044,3.243,0.6516,0.0037,2.3545,1.1008,3.7288,0.3708,3.0962,1.7349,1.3004,0.9404,0.8656,3.9252,0.0007,0.5448,0.3839,5.6614,3.9413,1.7381,3.65,0.6822,0.0746,0.4986,0.0121,2.6662,2.0243,0.4834,0.8712,1.1831,3.2691,4.6861,2.6069,5.0033,0.7333,0.6727,4.4331,2.5505,6.7086,0.3375,0.9815,3.7356,1.9668,3.8005,2.6103,1.1843,1.8997,0.7241,2.753,5.451,1.3171,3.1505,0.6926,3.2995,0.004,0.5288,0.6163,0.753,4.409,2.2524,5.6632,0.0535,1.3137,1.0426,0.9092,0.7954,2.0174,0.4382,0.0002,0.1392,0.0027,5.3851,0.2702,0.4165,0.3919,5.3795,0.8707,2.17,1.3618,5.2191,1.8268,1.2424,1.0984,2.2578,4.1089,0.9741,1.9626,1.3174,0.5549,1.6643,3.4343,3.865,0.5412,1.2273,2.9897,5.0626,0.0022,5.4689,1.816,0.9363,2.8695,1.6876,0.3603,1.4317,5.875,4.1462,0.859,6.0986,0.6906,5.2734,1.6774,1.0321,2.4694,5.0448,0.347,0.1021,5.9143,1.823,2.7574,3.4197,0.1312,2.3624,0.5708,1.2933,0.9515,0.0002,4.9241,2.889,3.1774,4.88,0.0568,0.6428,7.6196,0.0494,0.1714,0.4357,4.3017,0.1437,0.5145,1.6916,0.4741,0.9481,3.2413,1.8855,4.5965,1.4348,2.3852,1.068,0.7929,0.7329,5.835,0.998,1.5635,0.3846,3.0529,0.1064,1.505,0.431,1.7173,0.7545,0.3435,2.3506,0.3866,7.6011,1.5552,3.4274,2.0901,1.4035,0.3013,0.5787,1.7131,3.2634,1.6488,6.2681,3.5387,1.2664,1.2648,0.5444,0.0015,2.9114,0.0737,1.4825,4.282,3.9875,1.4801,4.3045,0.733,0.224,2.0788,0.3263,1.3094,0.0002,2.8791,3.2575,1.2438,1.3771,4.3232,1.8454,3.0334,0.0085,1.8737,0.9896,2.1305,1.4696,2.5031,1.3893,4.1476,0.9238,0.8716,0.0002,3.7482,5.7069,4.2703,0.2163,1.6122,0.6207,0.905,0.0394,0.3247,2.1434,1.1111,0.2622,2.8307,0.8183,1.9847,0.2011,2.4248,3.1681,0.9215]}
{"id":1698,"ended":true,"length":623,"gen_text":"A small coffee shop in the middle of nowhere... I couldn't believe the way they were able to bring the energy to the table because of the menu. Every single person that I knew was getting a great meal that they really loved.\n\nThis wasn't some trendy restaurant that was trendy because it was right next door to some popular restaurant. The guys over at Blue Plate were on the cutting edge of where everything was going and knew it. Blue Plate was the new kid on the block. The food was so unique, with more than one dish serving multiple purposes, and I would love to have found out about it sooner than later. This was a place where one could truly be themselves.\n\nWith more than 80 small-plates, five beer-inspired small plates, and an elegant wine list, Blue Plate proved that quality can and should run much deeper than just creating a new menu. They created an atmosphere that fostered a sense of respect for the food, the wine, and the customer. Blue Plate was also able to offer a variety of menu items on a daily basis to cater to the changing needs of customers.\n\nBut it isn't just the food that makes Blue Plate great. It's also the service (and great coffee!). While there are other coffee shops that can put their stamp on the coffee game, Blue Plate had always done things my way. The same goes for the food. When I ordered my drink as they had my drink out, it was done with respect and a sense of community and togetherness. It was very comfortable, if a bit old-fashioned. The service was professional, but also so kind. It was easy to tell that at least one person at each table was very busy enjoying the food. I didn't even get the sense that any of them were getting lazy. Every single time someone finished something, everyone was grateful!\n\nFrom wine glasses, to plates, to silverware, to the conversation, to the atmosphere, to the people \u2014 Blue Plate has something that will help you not just drink great beer and food, but the experience of it too.\n\nBlue Plate isn't just great beer and great small plates, but it's also great coffee. The fact that they had one of the best coffee shops in town and the quality of their coffee meant that we had to stop by to try it.\n\nIf you are looking for a place to go with your friends and enjoy something new, but you don't want to go to expensive restaurants where it seems like you have to try everything on the menu, and you don't want to go fancy restaurants where the food just comes out of a bag, then you can go to Blue Plate.\n\nThe food is great, the coffee is also great, and they both deserve your attention. If you are a regular at the West End, then no matter where you go in Halifax, no matter how you approach the situation, Blue Plate is there for you... because it is also about the people making that commitment to you.\n\nWith two bars, great wine, two large kitchen areas, and two excellent coffee shops, there isn't a better time to visit Blue Plate in Halifax.","token_len":646,"entropy":[6.4777,8.7224,0.5296,1.2149,1.6796,3.5694,0.0241,2.2424,6.5302,4.0886,4.7828,0.0011,1.4123,2.995,5.8073,1.9967,2.0593,2.9472,0.0035,4.4626,2.2912,4.932,2.8182,1.2104,2.2883,6.4789,1.1008,0.8033,5.392,0.8892,4.7344,1.5156,2.706,2.4726,2.0329,4.3878,2.0067,4.8886,1.7084,4.7155,1.156,3.9547,1.8564,4.1165,2.7803,0.5087,3.1195,0.0537,3.1295,5.852,0.0009,4.1202,4.9206,2.2263,1.6208,1.4729,4.8913,1.0181,0.8275,0.541,5.841,1.1443,1.4352,0.2783,3.3034,4.9035,1.3031,0.6035,3.1527,6.4574,4.239,0.5412,5.4569,3.5527,1.5417,4.7312,1.5741,1.5138,0.0125,0.5527,5.5313,4.6398,0.1722,0.6036,2.0041,5.6775,3.3456,0.4981,4.9072,0.0575,1.0613,1.7007,4.0291,2.1799,0.1663,0.0137,0.0162,1.3205,2.6678,2.253,0.4929,3.5461,4.3537,1.6965,4.5934,5.8847,1.2146,2.2379,1.8307,5.9647,2.5462,1.0285,2.0043,1.4806,3.3875,4.1504,4.0739,0.0897,2.2802,4.6665,3.74,0.8679,1.223,2.0544,2.8675,0.8295,0.1832,3.7106,1.3567,1.5152,1.9868,1.6448,5.1368,1.0334,3.1263,3.0254,2.9299,1.522,1.6475,0.0001,6.1103,5.1703,0.3303,4.3069,5.7739,3.6572,0.6558,1.4083,5.2924,5.496,2.3339,3.6826,3.9855,0.4386,0.3479,0.7645,3.326,5.8611,1.082,0.6513,0.3142,0.4312,0.0423,5.9756,1.0206,5.598,2.1993,4.2337,0.9533,5.5889,3.879,0.1333,0.0475,1.9876,6.1639,0.8178,3.3403,0.8598,0.8728,4.2564,3.3145,1.9908,1.3151,0.7546,5.0193,0.1049,1.9303,1.6911,0.007,6.0921,0.9779,0.9296,1.4386,1.4835,1.7936,3.7624,0.1765,0.2039,0.2657,5.006,0.4629,3.1777,0.0224,2.0918,4.4064,3.5473,0.0035,3.3269,1.2675,2.7628,0.0222,3.7492,0.5228,4.6314,1.4667,2.5043,0.1593,3.0328,2.1752,0.0553,1.7019,3.2412,1.4973,0.0843,3.5124,0.4054,1.2766,0.0002,5.8005,2.5295,3.9904,0.0005,0.3508,0.7817,0.5092,0.4399,1.2577,0.3362,0.0139,2.7451,0.2942,1.162,0.3763,1.5989,0.162,1.3085,6.7356,1.2081,5.5533,3.9211,2.0624,4.565,3.1854,1.1686,3.4973,3.0181,0.3022,1.6116,3.3425,4.96,2.6711,2.8656,0.203,1.1178,1.9532,3.6795,0.2139,0.6957,0.0153,4.9299,6.2934,3.6934,2.2385,5.5718,0.0789,0.4749,2.3849,5.6572,1.1123,0.0734,0.5031,1.7536,0.4035,4.0523,0.948,3.5184,1.5547,4.1468,7.3173,5.0973,3.2381,3.3266,3.6012,4.6629,0.8519,2.1574,0.4529,4.3581,1.1772,2.521,1.1921,2.9154,2.5062,0.0443,4.4647,4.7292,3.1221,0.0025,0.1997,2.6441,0.8385,4.6754,4.399,2.1463,6.0651,1.613,0.7919,5.3244,0.3768,0.3214,0.6733,2.6657,2.4922,0.7,4.2367,0.9529,2.4656,2.2704,5.6587,3.634,1.3524,2.5683,0.9175,3.5154,0.1112,2.2041,0.3839,6.9093,1.1643,1.0861,1.1269,2.3879,2.4921,0.0338,0.8489,4.3138,2.418,6.2951,1.2388,0.7855,0.9797,2.7411,3.9561,0.0003,2.5962,2.7664,1.6358,1.214,0.1561,3.4507,0.5515,0.8767,0.5943,3.8569,5.4139,0.8589,4.9258,0.811,2.6029,3.357,3.8139,4.5552,0.5538,4.0112,2.3649,5.0858,5.4936,0.7146,0.0002,5.3143,7.0058,5.7606,2.8922,0.3174,2.6901,0.2825,0.1497,4.1092,0.0078,0.1165,0.8545,2.4612,5.4866,1.2833,1.4238,0.1854,2.9101,0.4187,1.6925,0.0714,3.1815,5.1621,0.7887,0.0115,1.9275,2.7377,3.1047,2.3642,5.0823,0.365,5.3344,1.4609,5.4063,2.2855,2.4882,1.9835,1.1553,0.2133,0.0059,5.7992,1.8326,0.9788,1.5645,1.9693,0.1942,1.128,0.0002,1.8576,0.026,4.8495,0.0004,0.672,3.3086,1.2511,0.3221,1.7405,4.8491,0.1233,1.2207,1.7322,1.0774,0.2373,0.6986,1.2045,1.5817,0.8001,2.7172,5.5923,0.0293,0.8496,3.8345,4.1367,0.348,0.3448,0.6285,1.0203,0.7961,0.172,1.6878,3.8711,3.1479,4.1825,0.2138,0.652,0.219,5.571,0.364,3.6554,2.5326,0.8423,1.7493,1.5096,3.4698,1.4742,0.4726,0.5101,1.6109,0.0002,3.9488,0.2381,2.2496,0.8934,0.0959,0.4379,1.3149,0.7487,2.1559,2.5097,1.3228,0.5091,1.8553,2.5304,4.8098,2.8147,0.5965,2.7365,1.9271,1.068,0.0004,0.3957,0.074,2.3026,1.0197,6.2645,0.6545,3.9745,3.3535,3.3867,0.2586,1.3635,2.5816,0.2137,4.0253,1.1489,2.2603,0.1503,0.021,0.3243,3.9722,0.5181,0.7693,0.0002,0.2629,0.0511,1.9956,7.1691,2.8025,0.6861,2.0004,0.6714,2.5269,3.2582,0.3523,0.5522,0.6989,3.5994,0.8954,1.5719,2.2577,3.1007,3.0752,0.1843,0.0576,0.0118,0.4509,1.5003,0.0002,2.8156,1.9335,1.02,1.6157,0.3664,0.5456,1.9341,0.0913,6.3005,0.3142,0.2076,0.3269,3.6098,5.8532,5.5453,1.909,1.3522,0.2298,2.9974,0.1614,1.2178,2.7738,3.9973,1.3362,2.7174,6.3704,1.4897,0.9945,2.1106,6.9181,0.99,0.9866,0.0646,1.0653,3.1542,5.274,0.2641,5.1546,0.0065,1.9271,2.39,6.1238,1.4678,3.4778,0.0824,1.943,0.0089,0.9913,2.6679,1.3016,0.0069,7.1881,3.4816,1.6833,1.3074,5.7152,4.1125,1.4822,0.5489,6.677,4.0731,6.5344,0.5489,1.4641,0.3054,0.569,0.0002,5.3177,4.8837,4.1032,0.9205,4.9589,2.751,1.2269,5.5397,5.6435,5.4928,0.7264,0.2009,0.5552,2.5368,4.2294,1.9645,0.2247,0.3075,2.9898,2.9719,0.0003,0.8142,1.5038,3.657,0.1841,1.7808,2.0911,0.0094,2.1218,0.5225,0.3629]}
{"id":4584,"ended":true,"length":629,"gen_text":"The world wakes up one morning to find that any photo of a cat, digital or print has been altered. In place of the feline is something else and its quite troubling. Photos are even altered in realtime. Cat pictures no longer exist.\n\nIs it that people are growing more liberal or that technology is making us more accepting because of the ability to modify things on the fly?\n\nPeople are obviously far more accepting of the new technology now, but there is nothing that tells us that this was the outcome that should have been expected. The more people see this happening, the more they might have to question their current beliefs and attitudes.\n\nThis happens to all of us, we accept technology with the premise that people who can hack the technology can also hack society. As soon as we are assured that our personal information is secure, we accept it for the rest of our lives. As a result more and more people are accepting that our lives are no longer our own, that they can steal it, make your life a living hell and generally destroy your life. It's only a matter of time until the majority of people have their lives destroyed by the use of artificial intelligence and robot servants, or through hacking.\n\nThis is a scary scenario for those who already struggle to cope with their own personal life and their personal beliefs. No one needs to be put in this position because of technological changes, technology creates it for itself because it allows people to get what they want, sometimes without their consent, often without their knowledge, and at the expense of those who are forced to accept it.\n\nMost people would say that the reason they agree to such an unreasonable arrangement is because they were scared and confused at first and now understand better.\n\nIt is not necessary to have a robot worker to clean the house, you don't need a robot for that but if your job is hard enough, a robot may not exist. Your own decision to accept this new technology is not entirely your own.\n\nIf we accept the reality that there is no such thing as a free lunch, then we must accept this new form of slavery when it happens, we must ask if any other technology could be used in such a way, if it was possible to use one's own body to produce goods and services for others. What if we did not have to work at all, you would not be working if you wanted to, just sit and enjoy your life and your personal life for who and what you are, if you want. If it was legal to die, why would you work in order to live?\n\nWe should not let ourselves be tricked by some of these stories about this new technology. Many of the stories tell about people who have been living on earth for hundreds of years, they simply cannot imagine our society where the technology has changed that much. We should all understand that we are not the only ones that exist and that we are just a small fraction of the total population of the planet.\n\nWe do not have to take a leap of faith, we can just accept that it is no longer our time in the sun \u2013 we need to adapt rather than fight against the changes around us.","token_len":648,"entropy":[5.7385,8.834,0.0938,3.3287,0.5784,0.8492,0.5515,1.18,9.3067,8.4948,1.9247,1.9383,3.3191,3.3788,9.1595,0.0507,2.8383,6.7861,0.5397,2.6006,1.4198,3.6946,7.6243,0.0155,0.9206,4.25,0.0015,2.5368,4.0029,1.8643,5.4151,5.137,8.3353,7.7389,0.4758,7.2725,2.391,6.3562,2.5496,2.5276,3.062,4.5136,1.4093,5.8546,3.9988,6.0851,0.0159,2.6348,1.1385,1.3377,0.0031,4.6212,1.2994,5.1235,3.3469,0.919,5.6729,1.3555,4.5157,2.3105,1.8964,2.2601,0.5483,1.6533,2.277,1.0478,3.7444,8.2831,1.4656,1.4492,3.8992,0.1044,4.4456,2.8654,3.242,0.9533,0.8332,0.1824,1.5753,0.0002,5.8619,1.2536,5.6525,5.594,0.2874,1.3163,0.2423,2.1883,3.7112,1.2538,3.2983,2.0295,0.8849,2.9754,1.209,4.1629,2.7119,4.8003,0.4404,0.6599,1.8831,3.5755,1.7378,5.7306,2.5689,5.4479,0.2262,1.5896,1.1836,0.4064,2.7405,4.6555,3.0036,4.0171,2.2671,3.8473,0.4597,0.0579,0.185,1.2398,4.3384,4.3593,2.5192,2.1861,2.0355,4.4958,1.8643,1.8362,3.4348,0.6654,0.4672,0.0002,3.5508,5.8634,1.756,2.6018,0.6216,0.0427,1.5435,2.9607,3.7862,2.6311,4.3863,2.748,6.3834,0.0689,5.0363,4.4607,3.3094,4.1821,2.488,2.8213,2.0404,1.7085,0.4814,3.0382,0.3692,4.4779,3.1936,0.0076,1.6468,3.1838,5.9066,0.1534,3.1725,3.0208,0.8607,0.6378,1.843,0.4318,0.6668,2.4512,1.5508,4.3163,1.0181,2.0045,0.038,0.5051,0.0711,0.157,4.1633,3.2707,0.6863,7.3162,0.5662,0.0007,1.0534,1.0623,2.6173,2.7057,3.3034,2.3299,0.6082,3.041,0.0295,0.8648,0.0125,2.0391,1.3893,1.5263,1.9306,6.1719,1.3562,1.5516,4.2331,6.2016,0.4093,1.8604,0.1475,0.0129,1.2785,5.6891,3.1996,1.1499,0.7441,0.7249,3.8663,1.2062,4.0737,0.664,0.1124,0.0033,0.021,1.6065,2.2044,3.4171,0.3073,0.6603,3.7534,3.3627,1.1553,2.7289,1.2166,1.9244,4.9706,0.0377,6.5369,0.0234,1.5813,5.6123,2.8488,2.9695,2.5761,4.577,3.927,1.0642,0.2276,0.0002,2.8733,0.9156,1.9258,3.2059,2.9431,2.3034,2.9014,0.7944,5.1743,5.1087,1.481,2.2832,0.2354,2.3981,1.166,1.924,3.067,1.6997,3.3908,3.3347,4.9009,0.4296,5.9537,1.1589,4.9346,0.3023,1.0077,4.2912,0.6404,1.6921,0.7487,4.7105,1.2081,3.7533,2.8988,1.7204,4.2048,6.0744,4.3204,2.7352,1.9966,4.8818,0.8137,4.0453,1.5842,0.0762,3.9674,1.1858,0.0275,0.0853,2.0321,5.6994,2.3351,3.2208,0.7801,2.708,3.4193,0.7087,1.3286,0.3862,2.1867,0.6012,3.2583,1.4803,1.2963,0.0066,3.3106,1.0093,1.4016,3.715,0.2346,1.8374,0.6299,0.1927,0.383,0.0002,5.7458,0.7309,3.2298,2.6654,0.4366,2.3392,4.5458,2.0642,5.7895,0.6124,3.8035,3.4258,5.5596,3.2511,0.1357,0.463,0.5571,4.4537,5.3179,2.2876,3.3154,3.0367,1.287,2.3675,2.4482,3.2066,3.1573,0.6342,2.1589,0.0002,3.2688,1.4055,2.5449,5.6746,0.5037,2.8076,1.0929,3.2746,6.4878,1.5422,4.2514,2.3995,1.2032,1.3316,3.7258,1.7373,0.0007,0.736,1.3529,0.8624,3.6973,1.995,4.9856,2.3941,3.4446,3.637,0.6206,5.0848,1.8106,1.7854,2.7106,0.1665,3.436,3.3896,6.6129,1.3369,4.6407,4.1632,5.6395,1.0998,0.8789,1.9109,2.8926,0.9965,1.2249,2.3347,5.1688,0.8711,0.6554,1.6999,1.0252,0.0002,3.163,2.2737,1.6553,1.9374,3.3463,0.8814,3.7899,0.9279,1.2183,1.7518,0.0247,0.0085,1.4057,1.3573,0.0522,0.4332,1.1747,0.7479,1.6772,0.9256,4.3219,1.3512,5.4726,0.0079,0.9138,6.5963,0.9971,3.2002,2.8093,2.3374,0.5619,5.0625,3.5146,6.1523,3.4857,4.1753,1.8942,1.3434,1.4535,2.0972,1.5979,0.1102,0.4222,2.2563,2.1436,2.0618,2.5048,1.1113,0.569,2.9271,5.3137,1.92,0.2372,1.5284,1.0724,5.116,3.2261,0.8983,0.0975,1.8379,1.0685,1.3294,4.1197,1.2582,1.5391,3.8825,0.6794,1.0507,0.2864,1.8765,1.9781,0.1399,1.3346,5.9178,2.628,1.6465,2.2223,2.6303,2.9263,0.3937,2.2717,0.3134,0.9639,4.8395,3.2212,2.5578,2.0548,1.6237,0.3515,2.9131,2.8507,5.4663,2.359,4.3867,5.0638,4.2055,0.1657,0.0268,1.7125,1.6202,3.6501,0.6605,2.8217,2.3146,2.6152,3.5291,1.4267,4.0965,1.1074,4.6905,1.3319,2.2237,0.8464,0.8179,2.6093,3.8018,1.5979,0.0248,1.7703,0.7661,0.7163,0.0002,2.643,3.2372,1.534,4.3174,1.8185,0.2601,3.8281,1.8211,5.6175,1.8023,1.955,5.3661,2.8437,5.0795,0.719,0.5873,1.2615,5.1035,1.201,1.8385,1.3969,4.7538,3.039,1.9488,0.6128,1.9061,1.9036,5.7006,3.3166,4.5694,0.2622,2.2368,0.2366,0.9909,1.358,1.8501,5.946,2.3407,1.9063,6.5366,3.6875,3.2277,2.852,2.9254,2.4463,1.5365,3.6064,0.8239,0.8691,2.863,2.1257,3.9304,3.4299,0.5423,2.3174,1.0304,1.4631,2.1757,1.4422,0.4998,2.5996,6.9265,2.0646,0.909,1.5078,0.9622,3.8592,1.6838,1.2614,3.795,0.0503,0.5823,3.7615,1.0917,1.5334,0.7274,1.3901,0.2698,0.7859,0.0001,1.9823,3.9086,0.1684,1.2604,0.4801,4.7828,3.7705,2.5373,0.1123,0.0657,2.3582,0.7034,1.3357,3.3792,2.1545,1.0749,2.8227,0.6294,5.4273,0.0685,1.4107,3.8815,5.5463,0.6505,0.8928,7.5335,2.0343,3.8718,0.0565,3.6657,6.2735,0.0353,1.9031,2.1837,1.7015,1.2006,5.1241,0.0115,0.2304]}
{"id":2238,"ended":false,"length":610,"gen_text":"You are an assassin. A little girl has just come up to you, handed you all her pocket money and asked you to kill her abusive relative. You are asked to kill in the way that she wants... You need to do it like a man. In short, you are expected to behave like one.\n\nWhen you have finished the job, your boss tells you that she has been fired for not doing the job well enough. As you say goodbye to her, she asks, \"Oh what now? I hope you will not take it easy, you must have already shot lots of people \". The person you have spent all your life with doesn't understand that he is going to get a payback for having killed someone with a gun... Just what? If you do your job well, you will get the payback of someone you have killed with a gun. It is the duty of the police to give that payback.\n\nOf course, what will they do? They will not find a problem with your actions. Just like the judge, they are just going to say that he doesn't understand what is he doing in this case.... This is not the way a police officer is supposed to run the street.\n\nOf course, police officers can use their guns for good instead of bad ; they can also use them for hunting. But only when there is no other option... This is why we have a police force ; and this is why we have the right to the same rights that you have. When police officers act contrary to that, they can expect that they will get the full force of justice at least if they kill someone under the pretext that it is necessary to do it. That the police is expected to behave like a cop makes this problem much worse. This is my proposal; I ask all the police officers to understand that I am a person with feelings and that I want police to treat me as a person.\n\nIt is not just the police officers; it is also the judges and the people who can only see through the lies that these people tell you for a living. I would like to tell them, what I know about the world... Don't ever get your hopes up ; don't ever expect that you are going to beat the system as you wish. Don't get your hopes up about a justice system, one cannot expect to have a real justice system if they just go on abusing the rights of people over and over and over again. Stop the oppression of women and youth. Don't forget who it's actually you protect ; stop treating it as this huge black box that can protect anyone \u2026. Do not start your day on that way ; and if you can, start it with something good.\n\nI hope to one day see all human beings treated like human beings by police forces.

{"id":3781,"ended":false,"length":610,"gen_text":"You are an assassin. A little girl has just come up to you, handed you all her pocket money and asked you to kill her abusive relative. You are asked to kill in the way that she wants... You need to do it like a man. In short, you are expected to behave like one.\n\nWhen you have finished the job, your boss tells you that she has been fired for not doing the job well enough. As you say goodbye to her, she asks, \"Oh what now? I hope you will not take it easy, you must have already shot lots of people \". The person you have spent all your life with doesn't understand that he is going to get a payback for having killed someone with a gun... Just what? If you do your job well, you will get the payback of someone you have killed with a gun. It is the duty of the police to give that payback.\n\nOf course, what will they do? They will not find a problem with your actions. Just like the judge, they are just going to say that he doesn't understand what is he doing in this case.... This is not the way a police officer is supposed to run the street.\n\nOf course, police officers can use their guns for good instead of bad ; they can also use them for hunting. But only when there is no other option... This is why we have a police force ; and this is why we have the right to the same rights that you have. When police officers act contrary to that, they can expect that they will get the full force of justice at least if they kill someone under the pretext that it is necessary to do it. That the police is expected to behave like a cop makes this problem much worse. This is my proposal; I ask all the police officers to understand that I am a person with feelings and that I want police to treat me as a person.\n\nIt is not just the police officers; it is also the judges and the people who can only see through the lies that these people tell you for a living. I would like to tell them, what I know about the world... Don't ever get your hopes up ; don't ever expect that you are going to beat the system as you wish. Don't get your hopes up about a justice system, one cannot expect to have a real justice system if they just go on abusing the rights of people over and over and over again. Stop the oppression of women and youth. Don't forget who it's actually you protect ; stop treating it as this huge black box that can protect anyone \u2026.

{"id":4192,"ended":true,"length":606,"gen_text":"In the distant future, the only way to earn your high school degree, which is essential to survive, is to survive a fight to the death with a classmate.\n\nIn the distant future, the only way to earn your high school degree, which is essential to survive, is to survive a fight to the death with a classmate.\n\nThe only way to earn a Ph.D. is to become a brain surgeon.\n\nThe only way to earn a Ph.D. is to become a brain surgeon.\n\nI'm not sure it actually happens.\n\nA small, private school is trying to save money by giving away more than one hundred scholarships to students with low average SAT and ACT scores.\n\nI'm not sure the student will be accepted into one of those schools.\n\nThen, more than one hundred kids will submit applications, which makes some financial sense, because they can afford it, but the parents don't. And the kids will get rejected, and there won't be a pile of paperwork to fill out, so some of the other kids will go without a college education, while some of the remaining kids will get a lot less scholarship money than they were hoping for.\n\nThe school is hoping that there will be a good mix of the \"bad\" kids. Bad kids who have low skills (such as having only a high school diploma) and good kids who are just average kids without any skill at all. That's what we would call the \"average\" kid in a given field. The two groups are mixed together through the scholarship system. The student gets to come out at least a little more well off than he otherwise would if he hadn't went through the college application process.\n\nThe problem, as noted above, is that even at the top-tier schools, where the scholarship money is supposed to go to, there is very little correlation between high school grades and how many scholarships the wealthy kid gets.\n\nSo why does the school give out such generous merit-based scholarships? It's supposed to generate revenue, just like any other school could. I think the schools realize they'll have to get rid of at least a token percentage of their students if they want to have any hope of making money, so they want as many people as possible to get in, even if just for the sake of giving the school a \"bargain.\"\n\nSo if the scholarship money isn't going to the high school student, it goes to some kid with low SAT\/ACT scores who, by the school's reckoning, has high probability of being accepted to that top-tier college.\n\nThen they try to fill in the gap with high schools with high average test scores \u2014 the \"dumb\" students. And, like a child, the high schooler tries to get as much of the free money as possible, which means they apply to some college that has more scholarships.\n\nThere are, of course, other ways a small private school like this could make money in the near future, since most of their school goes without college because their students don't have the credits to graduate. We'll get back to that in a future column.","token_len":649,"entropy":[1.7422,7.9143,0.6603,0.2666,1.9439,4.9425,2.1544,0.3445,5.4344,4.6907,7.3266,0.9785,4.1721,4.7139,4.8189,1.2286,4.5456,0.7463,8.1355,2.1011,0.2487,0.4239,6.0387,1.9577,7.4953,2.3338,0.2752,0.0163,1.037,1.265,4.2935,0.7709,1.6737,0.0023,2.9444,0.8476,0.4774,0.0151,0.0211,0.5992,0.0416,0.0127,0.0179,0.0447,0.0169,0.0275,0.0025,0.0141,0.0153,0.0025,0.0013,0.0045,0.0018,0.0006,0.0013,0.0009,0.0022,0.0066,0.0018,0.0028,0.0015,0.0008,0.0002,0.0011,0.0029,0.0009,0.0177,0.5411,0.0001,2.3558,3.5926,0.4004,0.1076,1.1197,1.1286,5.4046,0.0038,0.0107,0.1576,0.7518,0.0919,3.6862,0.4418,5.731,0.4415,0.6125,0.4111,0.0002,0.8749,0.1085,0.0121,0.0099,0.2282,0.0695,0.1368,0.001,0.0008,0.0101,0.0071,0.0045,0.0065,0.0021,0.0041,0.0005,0.0039,0.0464,0.0002,4.2507,2.11,2.2669,1.4285,4.7198,5.6105,3.9854,1.969,1.4694,0.0002,4.5592,5.6467,2.8888,4.6895,1.5209,2.8348,3.5297,0.0638,3.691,0.7876,0.505,4.1761,2.1287,5.1602,1.9284,3.0811,1.3714,2.9305,1.3903,1.4536,2.6676,4.7007,5.5622,2.4438,3.4005,0.1052,0.0226,0.2277,0.7906,0.0003,1.9584,0.6268,0.1154,0.0154,7.1273,4.5103,2.6792,2.1794,2.8896,2.0541,3.6777,0.0655,2.2783,1.6502,0.5163,0.1496,0.0002,6.9055,1.9918,6.2178,1.0404,1.051,0.0549,3.131,3.0813,5.5226,1.1822,1.83,3.7882,6.3376,5.0195,5.747,0.3684,1.2919,2.2024,2.3985,2.6485,2.9105,2.3745,1.679,0.7922,2.713,5.5784,2.6757,0.0003,2.193,3.8652,1.6197,2.727,2.3101,2.6585,2.0736,1.6727,1.6475,3.7532,2.6617,0.0003,0.0346,2.2072,6.1715,0.0134,4.0094,1.0824,2.452,0.0189,1.3978,2.9008,5.2849,0.8412,0.8891,4.8184,0.6189,0.6256,3.3768,3.8928,1.3112,1.9213,0.4117,1.7919,4.2521,2.1643,0.6302,0.2668,4.7323,0.7145,0.2963,1.9926,1.6291,3.4968,3.4379,6.14,0.0209,1.1868,0.2084,3.6396,1.6426,0.1381,0.2858,0.3029,0.0003,2.3117,2.3141,2.4102,4.9366,0.88,4.6241,0.489,0.0888,1.1603,4.1843,1.7728,0.1156,2.7597,4.0716,4.2598,0.7709,0.5465,4.1203,6.3733,0.403,1.4854,3.083,2.8764,6.0116,4.2145,4.3756,0.0056,4.0647,4.3189,0.9848,0.8623,0.0828,0.5308,0.7849,0.4588,1.9705,0.0511,0.2551,2.256,4.0267,2.6473,6.1082,5.0347,2.2344,3.188,2.3465,0.0046,0.3011,4.6402,1.3179,1.8995,3.9951,3.8491,0.5914,2.4451,0.6016,1.7819,0.7516,2.1809,2.1974,1.8868,5.1052,3.5784,0.4463,2.8255,6.0469,1.3268,1.7524,4.2338,0.8855,5.4462,1.0979,2.767,2.2531,0.7919,2.5129,5.4633,3.366,2.6421,5.0632,3.3253,4.3501,4.5763,1.8655,0.5116,4.1576,3.2597,1.9766,0.5155,1.3297,2.1619,0.1102,4.9721,0.1249,1.9625,0.0003,6.1276,2.108,0.3221,4.1139,2.1506,0.087,0.245,0.4544,0.0003,1.6657,2.2965,2.9704,2.2845,5.2576,0.9028,0.0385,0.0422,0.0788,5.1433,4.6885,1.0654,2.8308,2.892,1.301,1.1766,0.2959,4.5978,1.1453,3.6457,0.743,0.3051,4.4118,0.0021,1.31,0.7215,1.1037,1.7653,1.6499,3.9958,0.082,3.2483,0.0624,3.7186,0.9718,1.207,0.0355,3.6437,2.8906,0.4504,2.4394,7.0777,3.3824,0.616,0.3015,1.2387,0.0003,2.9969,4.4499,2.188,1.3348,1.7529,2.7311,1.3732,3.6583,2.4557,6.5404,0.6461,0.0314,0.3187,0.5776,2.8789,0.8717,4.594,0.0052,5.6222,3.4619,1.4275,5.4103,0.2099,1.6444,0.4672,2.6184,5.3607,0.6088,4.4457,2.745,1.3325,3.8795,3.7026,3.0096,3.4419,1.5765,0.4633,4.3443,1.3685,0.0018,5.0402,0.0098,1.6855,7.2638,2.8923,0.0521,1.9739,1.8538,2.0254,0.1747,0.5421,0.162,3.9251,1.2089,0.9164,0.0276,2.0446,1.4058,1.5865,0.6673,0.3759,3.2098,3.1166,0.115,2.8444,0.4572,0.0615,0.3535,2.4133,2.8485,1.7512,1.8388,0.1219,5.3276,2.2549,0.6231,0.813,0.002,2.6,1.8133,1.7608,1.1847,3.5848,4.0103,1.5841,0.0864,1.3007,0.4935,0.0003,3.0133,3.6196,1.4014,3.1022,1.0247,2.4169,0.0002,0.9409,0.0799,1.1476,4.5584,1.0515,2.0568,0.9911,1.6157,2.5888,0.1329,2.964,2.5584,2.3898,3.3273,1.0146,2.9749,0.0076,0.1126,1.1934,4.2742,2.9846,1.3622,1.5442,0.009,3.9002,0.0222,1.5844,3.6227,4.9884,0.0188,1.4231,0.5498,1.6281,4.1544,3.0904,0.6868,0.0231,1.8481,0.5367,0.9203,0.0003,4.4663,3.9733,3.9691,0.0775,5.4324,2.4065,0.1727,2.7881,1.4569,4.7447,4.5005,1.9694,2.6315,1.3077,3.6134,0.0137,4.9612,2.5891,1.9536,5.3977,1.4368,0.7977,2.4115,1.1636,3.3911,3.0737,4.1041,2.386,5.8062,2.7703,1.0923,3.5403,0.1106,1.9742,3.8402,0.1659,2.9666,2.1713,0.5948,1.4721,0.1897,4.3757,0.7029,0.1296,0.7019,1.295,3.8846,1.6251,3.4439,5.1905,0.8538,4.4068,3.695,0.8043,1.7318,3.7835,1.8519,3.1628,0.7016,0.0003,4.1694,1.1305,3.9347,0.691,0.0001,0.0049,2.4202,1.8229,3.4831,5.4348,0.3778,0.1367,3.8605,0.2999,0.5288,2.7855,0.4269,4.4116,1.0642,4.1922,0.4551,1.5906,5.5058,3.8687,0.6956,1.3989,5.766,5.6655,4.7862,5.138,4.3133,3.723,1.5077,1.5366,0.0002,1.2759,0.8319,6.0259,0.883,3.1593,0.4962,6.1367,1.0016,1.5575,1.6925,0.0194,0.5079,1.1064,0.3757,3.5726,4.1005,0.1328]}
{"id":1604,"ended":true,"length":592,"gen_text":"The all-too-predicatble zombie outbreak happens, but rather than a virus that spawns cardboard cutout zombies, you have a frightening realization : all things undead, including vampires, werebeasts, demons, imps and everything else terrifying, are also coming to life.\n\nIn fact, in the year since those first few moments, we have been delving ever deeper and deeper into the supernatural side of our fiction.\n\nThe idea that our imaginations can conjure up the most unsettling, horrific, frightening and horrifyingly awesome of events all boils down to fear of the unknown.\n\nFear of the Unknown is our most basic human human instinct and it is what drives so many of us to explore the unknown territory of new terrains, people who might live there, and the strange stories they tell. It drives us to go to new places, to visit them, to find out more about them, to try to catch more of what's in them.\n\nIt makes our imaginations go wild and pushes us to find out the stories, the mysteries, the horrors.\n\nI can think of so many examples and examples of how this works :\n\nTake the horror movies. We have all seen them, and I know you have and I get so annoyed at those who try to say otherwise. There are so many instances from your childhood you can still hear in your head where you might even feel the fear. It's also something so universal in our minds now that we can't help but get a little scared every time the theme park theme starts playing.\n\nEven games where the player is in control, we all get a little nervous as they play. That's because it's an unknown territory to us. We don't know how well our character is going to perform because we have no way to playtest it, and you don't know what they might try.\n\nNow, I am not saying all movie monsters are necessarily bad. I am saying that if we do not go out of our way to try and make our characters act like we expect them to, we can almost always predict the outcome of the story.\n\nThe reason I say that is because if you know what your characters do, the unknown territory will become mundane to you.\n\nThere's absolutely something creepy about that idea and it makes a lot of sense when we consider that there are so many genres out there and so many ways we can tell stories.\n\nSo, the next time you write a story that has a vampire or some sort of ghost or an undead being, remember this :\n\nFiction is not real.\n\nFiction does not have to be a part of our reality.\n\nFiction is not a playbill for reality.\n\nDon't write a story about a dead body (if it exists ).\n\nYou are not the only one who can make

{"id":2799,"ended":false,"length":596,"gen_text":"A blind woman falls in love with a certain man and they marry. Years later an expensive treatment allows her to see again. Her husband is not what she expects. Is she going to fall in love again?\n\n\nIt's the story of how these women deal with their fate and their relationship with their fate.\n\nAuthor: Zorak S.\n\nThis book was highly recommended to me.\n\nAuthor: Nesrin\n\nThis book is the book before Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n's \"A Woman Who Is Very Good at Nothing.\"\n\n\nThis book was highly recommended to me.\n\nAuthor: Zorak S.\n\nI picked this one because I thought it sounded like a good read, with a nice twist on what a love letter looks like:\n\n\n\"Dear Mark,\n\n\nI am afraid the time is running out for our relationship. I am sure you can understand that I am hurting, and that is why I have decided to part with you.\n\n\nI have been telling my friends that I have some sort of secret, and that I want to meet you for a drink, but I have not told you what I have been hiding.\n\n\nSo, you see, I don't want to be judged. I don't want to give the impression that I am hiding anything. The way I have been acting may be rude, but sometimes things come out so quickly that the best thing to do is to keep things under wraps.\n\n\nI am a simple girl who spends her hours with her friends, and she doesn't have time to read novels like you.\n\n\nI am looking for someone who sees the same things as I, and understands my problems. You must be someone who cares, someone who has a lot of time at my disposal; someone who is in the zone. You must be someone who wants to be with someone who cares about them.\n\n\nAlso, I must tell you something - you will not regret what you did with me. There is nobody who can judge when you are ready for a relationship. There is nobody who can tell you whether something's right, or not. We are at our own threshold, the only ones who can decide that. I will do everything I can to help you, you will not be alone.\n\n\nHave a nice day and I hope we will see each other again in the years to come.\"\n\n\nWe had a great conversation. I ended up liking him a lot more than I expected.\n\n\nWe had quite, fun conversations. I would gladly read this book again, because I think that the characters were well-drawn and they were interesting. It really helped me to empathize with the characters better.\n\n\nHe told a very interesting story, all of which could have been an interesting novel.\n\nHowever, it just seemed like he was repeating himself (if he used quotes at all).\n\n\nAs a fan of Jodi Picoult's writing and my first book, I really wanted to love the book, but since I have now read several times, I can safely say this book didn't live up to my expectations.

{"id":2332,"ended":true,"length":606,"gen_text":"You notice that no matter how far away you move, it is always the exact same young man knocking at your door to tell you about you Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?\n\nIt was in the year 1810 that the King James version of the Bible was completed. In this version, the word \"Lord\" has been changed to the word \"Jesus Christ\" as the Bible writers believed that the Lord was God and the person of Jesus Christ should therefore not be called the \"Lord\".\n\nThese translators had made it quite clear that Jesus Christ and His Church were not the same person as the Lord. The Lord was always referred to as The King.\n\nToday, we know better. As a matter of fact, the word \"Lord\" has been rendered in an official way as \"The Lord\" in most English Bibles up until 2008.\n\nIt is amazing to note that the translators of the King James Bible actually did what the Bible writers never imagined. They left out the word \"Lord\" and instead translated the name of Jesus Christ as Jehovah. The translators of the King James Bible did the correct thing.\n\nBut when it was determined that the name of Jesus Christ had to be translated as Lord in order that it could not be used in a deceptive way, these same translators did the exact opposite which is so important in the word of God today.\n\nThe word 'Lord' has been used in this verse for many years without being changed due to the mistaken belief that Jehovah must be God instead. The fact is that Jehovah means nothing in that case. What the translators did was to leave the word 'Lord' out completely without even using it in place of the translation \"Jehovah\".\n\nWe live in this day in which time is measured by a quarter of a century, a year in which we count each day with a breath, where we find that we often forget about the day that just passed, and yet we must remember what it was that just passed.\n\nBut remember, when you are given the chance, if you know the truth concerning Jehovah, the Lord your God, you will never forget.\n\nWhen we speak the truth about Jehovah, Jehovah will always be with us. If you know the truth, you will know what is good, you will know what is good for your life and your heart, for you will never forget what Jehovah has done for you.\n\nI invite you to learn now the word of Jehovah today. If you are going to speak, speak the truth, the truth that Jehovah has bestowed upon you through Isaiah 45:\n\nYour God is one who is true, who knows and trusts,\n\nYou do not need any other god to show you his signs;\n\nAs surely as the sun rises in the morning\n\nYou can know for yourself that Jehovah is one! (Isaiah 45:8)\n\nThe truth is the only truth, but no one today knows better than Jehovah that no one knows the truth.\n\nThis information is very important to you. Take it for granted. Do not believe any lies. Trust no one but the one true God.

{"id":1541,"ended":true,"length":619,"gen_text":"You made a deal with the devil to become rich. He then tells you that fortune will be yours, but there is a curse. For every $ 1000 you spend, a random person on the Earth will die. Congratulations! You just won $ 250,000,000.\n\nHowever, that is exactly what will kill you... You need 50 to turn up because nobody will play this miracle for you.\n\nThe odds seem astronomically high. However, this could be a game with an entirely different outcome. In this simple game of chance, each and every day of the year is randomly assigned, and each and every dollar you spend is picked from 5 people, but you're the only one who knows how many people will die from that daily die, and every time you spend money, you are playing for it.\n\nSo, with this simple game, what do you need to know about the odds?\n\nThe more money you spend, the less people will die from it. But if you spend more money, the more people will die from it than you can afford. As soon as there are more people living on the Earth, the odds will become less of each other dying.\n\nHowever, if you are lucky and you become rich on a single day - as some people claim to be - you will have a 2 in 3 (28.5%) chance of being the luckiest one of the entire Earth. The others will all be poor.\n\nIf you spend more than $ 1000. Then, every time you go to your favorite restaurant, coffee shop, movie theater, museum, theater, pool, soccer, tennis, bowling game, football, or poker match, even if it's like a 100-player free-for-all, you will risk your life, just by being there. But it will be you, so, as in this game of chance, there is a better chance of all the deaths occurring to someone else than to you. Of course, if you are extremely wealthy, you will be just as wealthy on each day of the year, as there is a 3 in 3 (39.1%) chance of you having the luckiest day of any other person living on Earth.\n\nIf you become wealthy on any other day at all, then the number of victims will be very high (between 2 and 4 million ). People won't stay dead, but instead will get rich off of you. If you become one of the 3 people with the most millionaires living on Earth, on any given day, then the odds of your lucky day occurring are over 1 in 20 (1.2%). On average, it is only 1 in 60 (0.05%) to be that lucky - so you are far more likely to be that lucky than the 3 people of the Earth to whom the most millionaires live.\n\nYou are not always unlucky all of the time. For every $ 1000 that you spend, your odds of finding someone living on the Planet (that you can use that $ 1000 to cheat on with the Devil) increases by approximately 20 - and if you spend more than $ 60,000, you can have up to a 20% chance of that person killing you.","token_len":653,"entropy":[7.4386,1.6762,4.0821,0.2734,0.8622,0.1171,3.3266,2.8352,5.238,1.5656,3.3758,6.1611,4.498,0.021,1.08,8.1952,2.4813,1.462,1.1065,2.7852,0.9347,4.3315,1.0671,0.5166,7.1715,1.9227,5.5499,1.6912,3.6458,9.9992,0.3968,2.4168,0.7249,3.7747,3.1808,1.9432,2.55,0.3337,4.7352,0.887,0.4787,0.6404,9.63,1.0918,0.6686,2.6932,3.8829,2.1517,6.3308,0.6125,0.0254,2.1256,0.1842,1.0505,1.8885,0.0113,5.2232,0.053,3.8577,1.5011,5.1959,0.5354,3.2676,5.3781,0.4435,4.7936,4.4339,3.9137,7.1709,5.2579,5.4142,4.4826,6.2762,6.1254,1.6798,4.7698,2.5079,7.6741,3.3597,0.4755,0.4178,1.6153,0.0001,2.6101,4.4202,5.6054,5.7882,0.0536,0.0072,1.1805,1.8041,3.2467,0.0536,2.9178,5.9409,0.8123,1.3742,2.8927,3.7565,2.9119,4.9923,0.2438,3.9363,0.5527,3.4872,2.3448,5.998,0.8945,2.8576,0.6188,0.2014,4.5538,4.7236,0.0314,4.1908,3.6892,1.9243,0.5039,2.3365,4.466,2.0577,4.1799,1.0818,2.8022,1.6793,0.0076,4.9729,0.7629,0.2371,1.0302,6.1587,2.4074,6.8195,2.1031,2.769,4.2744,2.1634,4.7125,2.3104,0.2542,0.1527,0.534,1.8045,2.9386,1.4316,1.016,1.4436,0.3367,3.5913,2.1988,6.3764,6.1685,3.4661,0.7055,4.1037,2.1102,0.1279,0.7285,1.8719,0.5572,0.9513,1.8253,3.531,3.3022,4.1192,0.5728,0.7433,0.0002,3.3066,1.0886,4.7399,2.2864,1.457,0.8923,0.8448,3.3965,2.5398,0.1251,3.2429,0.102,2.2914,2.1171,1.8693,2.085,0.9169,0.7293,0.0001,1.8487,4.499,1.419,0.0404,0.6485,0.2985,0.0507,2.905,2.101,1.1574,0.0534,2.3404,1.2719,0.4557,3.5009,2.6598,0.0986,0.997,2.2916,1.8846,0.7988,1.1778,0.623,0.216,0.4547,0.0167,0.8581,0.0176,6.4678,1.8254,3.0986,1.0503,0.7591,4.9803,3.2701,0.0095,5.5918,0.6424,1.7873,0.528,4.5633,1.3186,1.5235,0.5097,0.7445,1.0549,1.2386,3.0254,2.6196,3.4536,3.7723,4.366,4.5473,1.0185,0.8946,1.0011,0.0002,3.6387,0.028,1.1984,0.216,3.0891,2.7878,2.6268,2.1026,4.9956,0.78,5.9382,1.876,2.2151,0.0694,5.6413,4.5213,4.2653,0.9988,3.3412,0.8939,1.0771,0.4189,1.5143,0.7338,2.124,1.5121,5.3977,0.883,1.5458,4.7482,5.2134,1.1693,2.1051,0.12,0.0196,0.1264,2.3695,1.3893,4.1645,0.0014,3.4786,2.5587,1.2086,3.8901,1.0328,0.4945,3.3117,4.8615,0.5048,2.8619,2.0928,2.5818,1.4747,0.555,0.0002,2.6336,0.2104,2.2482,2.1712,0.7936,0.5309,1.8986,4.6878,4.6115,1.702,3.334,2.314,0.1209,5.5517,0.691,3.8868,4.4627,1.8944,0.4334,5.0112,0.062,0.2108,3.2099,0.4113,0.1555,5.1964,0.1797,5.605,0.1597,4.6851,0.9585,5.7847,2.7107,2.6866,0.2251,2.8368,5.7069,0.1258,5.0976,0.5856,2.6438,6.3186,4.9698,0.1621,6.0812,0.5077,1.8683,0.5978,6.9001,1.8885,5.4656,2.5576,4.3696,4.6032,0.7824,0.0324,0.0134,0.0042,0.437,0.8167,0.9609,5.2102,1.5402,0.1274,2.7575,3.5857,3.4996,2.3582,0.3112,0.2134,3.9304,3.8851,2.0364,0.8648,4.6941,1.9307,2.8662,3.9365,3.6358,4.7892,4.0469,0.7567,2.0068,0.1997,0.0539,3.1782,0.542,0.9285,5.3148,0.7587,0.8356,5.2256,1.6005,4.2728,2.1698,2.2469,2.4732,0.1599,1.7351,0.8081,0.0751,0.1645,6.0279,0.2103,0.0745,1.623,0.1973,1.5707,4.3223,2.5331,0.3677,1.0572,1.1217,1.3939,5.3696,0.5862,4.6108,3.7448,2.6708,0.9093,1.217,0.091,0.0596,1.7004,2.4763,2.2058,0.9228,1.0418,4.5596,0.0786,1.4384,1.227,4.1944,0.154,2.1917,0.0132,0.0275,0.7935,1.1214,3.648,1.8541,1.5667,0.0351,0.4055,0.5609,5.1937,4.1769,1.3978,3.808,0.1727,1.0645,0.2123,0.4146,0.0002,2.1603,0.1295,4.6477,2.3266,1.8461,2.4081,2.5931,0.0554,6.5745,0.2078,0.1407,1.6644,2.0362,4.743,0.0868,6.1862,0.8704,0.6148,4.1872,2.9537,3.9489,4.7265,2.7527,0.569,1.8903,2.1467,7.7954,5.6805,4.8628,0.0005,5.8976,1.6958,2.3988,1.2735,4.8488,0.8006,3.6694,4.1963,3.4318,0.7943,1.1094,0.7601,3.3917,0.2353,1.996,5.4368,0.0893,0.3054,6.1901,1.7959,2.3669,0.324,2.1134,4.0831,3.8956,0.239,0.3355,0.3686,4.4204,0.4558,1.6899,0.0835,0.3366,1.1732,1.9933,1.5135,0.7185,2.4842,5.9937,0.1261,3.8843,1.2995,4.7145,2.6816,0.1474,3.9362,0.9102,1.9018,1.0676,1.0362,1.014,4.5142,2.452,0.0882,2.8791,1.8845,2.8032,0.7327,0.1877,4.7883,0.7777,1.3217,0.0015,3.3263,0.8744,3.6903,1.1697,2.8219,0.0935,4.3195,2.9867,2.2591,1.7671,4.278,0.4685,0.0544,0.0381,0.8247,3.5264,0.7076,0.8094,2.0712,4.5438,1.0974,5.3022,0.5485,2.9111,5.2053,2.0113,2.2769,3.2162,0.9284,0.6351,0.484,0.3082,0.0002,3.6769,2.7049,2.7442,4.9267,3.3365,6.9384,2.3604,0.0102,0.0203,0.5297,3.5759,1.9882,1.2426,0.6361,2.7799,0.0312,0.2507,0.285,4.4862,1.3137,0.232,5.479,1.5092,4.2179,0.6435,0.4929,6.5837,4.9965,3.1457,1.4957,1.4367,5.4398,4.0565,1.7439,0.1224,0.6664,5.792,1.7652,1.8903,5.0857,4.394,0.3261,2.9613,0.7284,4.2722,3.6975,5.7884,2.957,2.5124,0.1562,1.0108,1.0154,0.3254,0.2259,6.1146,0.2763,0.2,0.5527,1.7853,2.0224,2.7499,2.773,0.0034,0.747,2.8433,0.664,0.2135,0.1488,3.618,2.6201,5.6887,0.3349,0.8519]}

{"id":4550,"ended":false,"length":609,"gen_text":"Instead of the death penalty, convicted criminals are sentenced to have their minds overwritten by that of a recently deceased notable individual.\n\nHowever, that idea is now changing thanks to the creation of the \"mindwrite\" technique. In short: the person writing the \"wet\" mind-wipe gets to choose a famous person and write their life story while the person under mind-writes is left to just live through the experience.\n\nIt sounds a bit extreme, and at first you might not believe it actually happens. But it already does, and has been documented. On top of that, the technique doesn't work just with famous people or politicians; it can also work with people with completely random names.\n\nFor instance:\n\nA person with the name Chris Johnson wrote a story in 2008 that began, \"One morning this little kid named Chris Johnson was walking along River Drive in Memphis when a car full of people pulled out, and there was this man in the side-mirror. He made some strange gesture at Chris. Chris looked over at the man in the car and said, 'You want me for a pilot?' The man got out of the car and said, 'Of course not, I'm already dead.' \" Chris' friend, Matt, who was also playing the role of the writer, said: \"I had already had my heart broken when I was 6 by a girl I met on a porn site.\" The friend had planned on getting a divorce, and that incident caused Matt to lose his job. While he was struggling, Chris went out into local bars and took part in fights with locals, leaving him with a black eye. The friend had had enough, though, and went in for a divorce with Matt at the age of 24. But their split was never legally finalized. \"You could say I didn't go through the divorce. I went through a period of depression for 6 months after I filed for divorce. The only thing that stopped me from throwing myself under a train was the fact that my best friend Matt was going through the same thing,\" Chris said, chuckling. Chris had to write a story about the experience of being in the relationship with a dead man, so he decided to pick a dead person he thought was cool, like John F. Kennedy. The only problem: \"I wasn't sure who killed JFK. He wasn't that influential, and I had to think about why I felt the need to write about someone who isn't that influential, and I think I found a new writing method,\" Chris said. After that, Chris wrote his story about one John F. Kennedy after another and published it online, to the total amazement of the internet. The story was shared on all of the famous places on the internet (like facebook and news.ycombinator ), and the people behind the story were featured in the documentary JFK Exposed.\n\nNow, that's a story I wouldn't mind reading myself.\n\n[h\/t: CNN]\n\n[Image via Shutterstock]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Tina Nguyen (@Tina_Nguyen) on Twitter\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com","token_len":654,"entropy":[0.9805,3.2406,7.6834,0.8161,0.3677,6.2085,2.731,2.4363,1.631,0.0364,7.1475,0.4319,6.2912,8.0525,0.0259,1.6348,8.1388,0.4691,0.9302,8.6123,0.8834,10.9962,4.075,0.7471,2.0488,0.0034,5.406,0.0624,4.2087,5.451,1.3788,3.7641,5.5339,3.2787,0.0245,1.5074,4.4279,0.0212,1.1776,2.7012,5.2171,3.371,0.7643,3.6157,0.9541,3.5722,3.6055,3.9497,2.07,3.9598,2.5245,0.5076,4.3072,4.0033,3.6234,0.6768,2.1037,2.6403,0.6072,0.3086,4.004,0.6546,1.4754,2.4737,2.3652,0.5797,2.4557,2.1968,1.4767,3.57,0.2543,4.7111,1.1929,1.8421,4.7934,3.0557,1.0375,3.672,0.656,1.1682,2.0931,1.0572,4.5721,3.1084,3.5552,0.8458,1.3847,0.3607,0.4138,0.0002,3.7924,2.0173,2.5183,0.7595,3.7073,0.3596,2.445,5.0269,0.4372,3.4455,0.5495,3.334,1.0109,0.5114,4.1551,2.3099,0.6687,1.075,2.157,7.2158,0.9784,1.6276,0.7734,4.085,1.0653,3.0494,2.5065,6.3517,3.7423,0.0048,0.1991,0.0464,1.5558,1.693,4.8694,0.0004,3.4421,3.0587,2.6203,1.1131,0.1569,4.3886,5.5663,2.6811,0.567,1.2169,1.4403,1.1895,0.236,2.7533,2.6456,5.5752,2.3399,0.8729,0.6632,0.4555,0.0002,3.2793,1.4594,4.0209,1.0447,0.0002,2.9782,4.1712,2.8164,0.4375,0.5728,5.8191,5.1226,2.4705,0.8855,1.912,3.2486,4.363,2.7113,4.828,1.8272,0.115,4.7507,2.8136,4.2847,6.0227,3.6156,2.7273,0.1602,0.6612,2.1871,1.7628,3.0533,6.7173,3.9035,1.0819,5.2256,1.4774,1.8365,2.3887,3.2808,0.0026,3.0271,1.088,3.0495,4.1524,2.4212,4.7602,0.6271,1.9349,2.941,1.4132,0.6246,7.7242,1.5848,3.1262,0.0105,2.2218,1.1307,5.9051,3.8291,2.4868,4.6312,3.7744,1.3099,2.2597,1.7225,2.0729,2.0789,0.9368,0.6308,0.9145,1.2343,0.0199,4.9596,0.8079,1.7585,0.3535,0.1547,2.8447,3.1552,1.6531,3.6455,0.6393,3.5774,0.5075,1.0974,0.2767,4.5793,0.5695,0.4843,0.1998,0.1159,0.571,1.6956,0.1866,0.0118,3.7968,0.0063,1.6222,1.1071,1.5239,1.1817,5.0133,1.0501,0.7572,2.0236,3.1024,3.6181,2.7748,2.1332,5.2047,2.0592,2.4558,0.7985,2.5802,6.3881,2.275,1.4021,0.0858,1.2114,2.0078,0.151,1.7633,3.5999,0.0558,1.5812,3.3855,5.3105,4.4103,2.6083,3.6928,0.51,3.831,0.4718,1.0976,5.166,2.445,1.195,1.9565,1.9272,2.9987,1.6244,1.4761,4.9358,0.4699,2.5705,2.9022,2.5599,3.7778,5.333,1.6837,3.1922,1.3415,2.5311,1.3872,1.6911,5.1194,5.5727,3.9369,2.4149,0.0962,3.1554,0.4935,0.7291,0.8372,5.2329,2.2775,0.3428,5.0198,1.2405,0.484,3.9041,2.4211,3.867,8.5483,1.292,0.7199,4.3305,3.3735,0.063,3.4915,2.2252,3.8918,2.0883,5.353,1.4598,0.5863,0.504,2.0272,0.0012,0.6761,2.8319,2.1578,3.3991,5.3535,0.5706,1.0642,4.8762,0.2132,0.118,3.1404,3.9938,3.6226,0.6597,2.6155,3.6747,1.4962,4.8517,0.8008,2.9709,0.003,3.3022,0.1189,3.6778,4.7888,4.5181,0.786,3.7937,3.9681,0.5179,1.0139,2.3276,4.6854,2.8558,1.7227,1.225,4.1216,0.0005,3.9518,1.1039,2.0435,1.7497,3.975,0.79,2.3287,0.3775,1.2121,3.995,0.2504,2.0083,4.2881,4.9481,0.3788,2.0984,2.2405,5.0098,0.6249,0.2499,1.3916,3.7061,2.4267,1.1942,0.8304,3.4902,0.2311,0.3669,4.4027,0.9972,2.4121,0.2076,0.6198,0.4655,1.5633,0.8542,0.0961,2.0214,3.3716,0.0505,1.8836,1.1128,2.6032,0.1494,1.0999,0.5844,0.2266,1.8052,0.5202,0.4385,3.6172,4.3295,0.0005,0.218,2.9221,3.1211,3.466,3.9268,1.3143,1.1244,1.0017,1.8351,1.7633,3.2835,1.6847,2.1286,1.5579,5.1385,0.9464,2.5408,2.2622,0.6232,1.4253,3.1046,0.4188,2.6028,0.1843,3.9115,1.0555,2.4342,1.9652,2.6158,3.4575,1.7636,2.7934,2.0821,1.9245,3.7338,2.9438,0.0248,0.0013,0.6775,3.0735,3.9492,0.336,2.665,3.2093,0.9172,3.6841,0.0004,2.0261,1.8934,6.6195,1.0645,1.1262,3.481,2.7794,0.0002,3.7018,5.6808,1.4834,1.2475,0.9698,2.9332,2.5383,2.7487,1.9832,3.5828,1.8998,4.2024,1.6534,0.1927,0.0135,0.5652,0.8623,3.6993,0.7524,5.0724,0.0003,1.9206,1.2893,2.6122,1.5417,1.5375,3.4112,1.59,2.7167,2.2204,6.1374,5.7485,2.7411,1.1752,0.4139,0.2284,0.1255,3.8225,4.4405,0.3371,0.7593,2.0043,2.5753,0.4076,2.1109,5.4553,3.4319,0.0745,0.0271,0.0092,6.0136,0.2975,3.892,4.5235,0.2589,1.7639,2.0427,5.37,1.4001,6.2743,2.4305,0.0003,0.0781,1.5775,1.7008,0.2913,2.5608,0.9018,1.7167,3.4133,1.9972,5.1769,2.1485,0.3844,4.7055,5.6231,0.7307,0.0273,0.3503,3.2842,2.4181,5.4233,1.1923,5.6413,1.5978,0.5124,0.2276,0.0006,0.0003,5.8629,0.4979,2.4881,4.6717,5.1403,0.7003,1.1746,1.6575,5.3093,1.0422,1.2526,5.7358,4.0371,4.0153,0.0005,0.8938,1.0943,0.0002,3.8256,0.6621,3.4041,0.7083,1.3729,2.4697,3.1954,2.6646,0.0003,0.7843,0.7973,2.7857,0.3746,0.7727,0.0002,3.5668,2.2964,0.0016,0.0003,1.0067,5.2288,0.4615,1.8315,0.0002,0.2782,0.4523,0.0751,1.6805,0.2411,0.1124,0.0002,0.0855,0.1723,0.0057,0.0003,0.0069,0.0066,0.5178,0.0004,0.0,0.0003,0.0005,0.0001,0.0004,0.0009,0.0003,0.0001,0.0008,0.0007,0.0003,0.0001,0.0004,0.0,0.0001,0.0002,0.0,0.0001,0.0,0.0001,0.0,0.0,0.0011,0.0]}
{"id":1426,"ended":true,"length":621,"gen_text":"Every night you have a vision of the future : the love of your life dying in your arms. You try to change things, and it does effect the vision in various details, but you haven't managed to change the most important part, and you are running out of time.\n\nYour daughter was in the ambulance to the hospital, and the doctor there told you that she died with all her organs working perfectly, although she has a very short life in the time it took you to realize the problem. She has been saved now, but you had her on life support and she was put to sleep three times, and each time he wanted to put her to sleep and give her brain a chance to recover.\n\nIt is getting easier with each passing day, but it doesn't change the fact that you knew that something was wrong since the beginning, with your relationship with Lisa, which led you to your love of photography.\n\nWith more and more photos you will have in your possession, some with amazing moments and some with a lot of blood inside. You will have some memories from your time with Lisa, and there are a lot of photos taken during the second time ; some during the second period.\n\nThey might be the most important pictures you have ever taken, and you know that some of them were not enough to capture the full beauty of your life.\n\nNow you know where the problem is, but you feel that it is also something that can only change with time.\n\nYou do not know where to go from here, and this makes you sad, it is the reason why you always think of your daughter.\n\nAnd that's what motivates you : you want to look at the photos you have taken at least once, because you want to see how she changed after the period of time, the photos she had taken on her trip to Germany and the pictures of her time at Ume\u00e5 University.\n\nShe was a good girl, but didn't realize her own life. You know that's what she had to go through, for sure.\n\nIt was her mission during her time at the University to become a good photographer ; she was really good, but you know that she was not ready for something bigger, and it was your daughter's job to realize her goal.\n\nThere is nothing you have been able to do so far that will change this, you know that.\n\nBut there were a lot of people who knew about your problem with Lisa, and you think that a good photo will show them that everything is fine now, and that you are okay now.\n\nAnd you feel that this, even if it happened some time ago, is something you deserve.\n\nYou want to be present if it is your turn to ask the question ; of course, you want to be comfortable with it, but you also want to feel all of these emotions.\n\nIt also might be a good time to ask your daughter if she thinks you look different ; she was right about that once. She had the chance to see that you were no longer the guy who had no life.\n\nFor you, everything was possible once, once you had that passion for photography.","token_len":654,"entropy":[5.0115,4.401,3.0411,1.6627,6.1199,0.9364,1.6851,1.628,10.1209,2.2831,7.5722,1.0433,1.169,0.7398,4.9248,2.0392,2.3099,0.0066,1.9211,1.6858,4.1917,0.3379,4.5521,2.8591,1.1108,3.1101,3.5557,3.792,10.4421,2.0067,6.2741,3.2692,5.051,8.5235,0.9594,0.4015,1.9571,6.6338,0.0027,3.2969,0.0704,1.3466,0.7054,5.3352,0.4837,2.0353,2.1389,2.6391,3.3476,2.1709,6.407,0.1965,0.0062,0.1608,0.3487,1.417,0.0428,3.9903,3.9763,3.8672,3.568,1.2921,5.3532,4.1346,0.8568,0.3022,1.2824,1.3423,2.6983,1.8626,3.7068,1.8584,0.6172,0.4727,0.9878,2.8925,4.7814,4.4542,0.7241,1.1863,2.5867,2.0204,1.6018,5.547,1.2907,4.2066,1.7458,2.5085,4.0733,0.2881,5.5129,1.7037,4.6492,1.8927,2.1005,1.1314,0.0438,4.1222,2.8795,2.4678,0.3472,2.6589,2.5729,2.2868,3.9018,4.4205,0.3182,0.4204,1.5255,5.1352,4.7149,3.1639,0.3538,0.0905,2.5396,2.0617,2.7204,4.811,2.4827,0.1324,5.5013,1.3006,2.0332,0.9921,3.5223,0.0331,7.1843,4.507,0.2363,2.624,0.0715,0.4109,0.0687,3.3109,4.9406,0.2003,4.4599,1.0751,2.0118,0.114,0.8392,0.6791,0.9259,0.0002,3.5552,1.4429,4.854,5.2109,3.7957,0.766,0.857,0.3361,0.4738,0.3518,1.9115,3.7848,0.0015,2.6408,0.2709,0.4032,0.0475,0.8161,5.972,1.7374,3.006,0.6028,0.4342,5.2019,0.6557,1.8898,1.6794,7.4263,1.5484,5.8607,0.4744,8.0186,1.1326,4.2166,3.9705,1.8362,0.0845,4.4103,5.3051,1.8578,3.5252,0.9108,1.1527,0.0002,5.0947,6.4625,1.2406,0.0038,4.3011,2.0242,2.9858,2.2671,3.1678,0.5194,2.6802,0.2755,5.4015,4.6761,5.9206,3.0296,1.7628,0.8565,0.7618,3.9022,2.0128,0.0278,4.3868,6.2975,1.6813,1.6972,0.9677,1.3364,3.8111,3.7762,3.5445,1.4591,2.997,0.5044,0.8247,0.4606,1.2447,5.2963,1.6388,2.4629,0.4905,0.0915,1.9938,4.5661,2.1416,0.9348,5.7258,3.2272,10.0032,3.4158,4.5325,0.4452,4.1924,4.6974,3.0201,0.69,0.0002,4.8288,5.7204,1.0748,2.8394,1.4959,1.0321,3.2603,1.2408,1.2101,1.0354,0.1602,1.0383,1.1276,1.0195,3.3353,0.4828,4.5541,0.7193,0.1518,4.1211,3.7344,4.6553,0.7853,4.6138,0.9136,2.9205,3.0546,0.1426,1.6981,1.972,1.7093,0.6144,0.0002,4.4799,0.9671,2.9117,4.4635,2.0884,0.996,1.037,0.7556,1.7314,0.6759,4.5276,1.4144,1.9957,0.8641,4.9707,3.5827,0.8544,2.1636,2.7017,5.6832,1.1285,0.5771,0.617,1.195,0.0001,1.5539,4.9518,0.376,0.9523,2.9849,1.3836,1.6595,1.0573,0.1437,0.5302,1.1226,4.4403,2.971,0.1473,2.0077,1.4429,4.7536,2.536,2.5719,2.7588,0.3383,0.1561,5.3421,3.482,1.3277,2.047,0.5594,1.5452,0.6522,0.0002,4.1617,3.1086,1.8304,2.7066,5.4554,0.0006,0.0304,2.966,1.522,1.3129,0.228,5.7454,1.5194,1.2708,1.1893,1.9572,0.8488,0.6828,4.9639,2.2639,0.1801,1.5909,3.6918,0.882,1.6019,0.1992,2.1377,1.9383,2.0607,5.1686,4.0913,1.6409,5.4135,1.0957,1.1336,2.948,4.7848,3.037,4.1689,2.8612,2.215,4.5695,1.0199,2.9404,0.6291,4.9906,2.0265,2.1316,2.3628,2.2393,0.6632,5.6881,2.3158,7.8009,1.965,0.1287,0.937,0.5338,0.2416,0.0002,3.7898,1.496,1.8857,2.9524,1.9165,0.4103,2.5156,6.2858,0.0012,4.323,2.7532,2.8751,5.0648,2.1637,1.9488,2.0239,0.5262,5.8616,1.733,2.2593,3.7496,0.9778,3.1425,0.0144,1.017,5.3204,4.0947,0.686,0.4221,0.0002,3.3512,2.7058,3.704,5.9244,5.2342,1.0325,1.1419,0.7527,2.2218,1.4361,0.6785,2.9359,0.6696,3.0081,0.9583,4.7056,0.9571,1.8904,4.0531,1.6859,1.2367,1.3567,2.9597,1.8708,0.4442,1.057,1.8036,1.2532,3.2558,0.6704,5.0327,3.2204,1.6439,1.183,2.9383,1.2317,3.4797,3.4982,1.1739,3.2934,0.1558,3.8897,2.4531,3.1236,0.3762,0.2078,0.0002,4.5174,1.1578,2.6263,1.7824,4.3875,3.2274,0.3821,0.0086,0.2533,2.8118,0.0018,2.2458,1.6696,1.2835,2.0216,1.0986,2.5119,1.0175,0.6643,1.2877,0.4756,0.0001,1.942,2.8905,5.718,2.3215,0.9501,0.0084,3.4385,0.8579,3.7003,1.4907,1.3042,2.1694,3.21,0.4672,0.4221,0.4994,1.3454,3.6222,0.569,5.3544,2.6862,2.6659,2.0203,3.428,1.7378,1.0183,4.1663,0.4873,2.1218,2.6853,0.8886,0.945,0.713,0.9179,0.7961,3.1306,2.8325,0.3739,0.2293,0.0002,2.5497,1.5179,3.5868,0.5378,2.5246,6.1246,3.5002,0.5408,0.4039,7.2055,4.4677,0.6542,0.1525,0.0825,0.9761,2.0557,1.556,5.1834,0.9755,0.2245,0.0001,1.4292,2.9561,0.1772,2.6814,5.7962,6.83,3.5186,1.6227,2.4945,2.3236,0.5157,4.3279,1.9623,0.9228,3.9996,6.5388,0.039,1.06,0.5408,2.7255,0.1472,1.2452,6.5273,1.9117,1.8495,0.4864,0.5242,0.4689,0.7575,0.5479,0.1003,3.0743,6.2126,1.6154,3.7503,0.4254,1.9267,0.1827,0.0002,2.7424,5.5247,4.152,0.6895,1.5402,0.6978,3.0,0.1738,1.7533,1.7286,1.3521,1.7942,0.3502,4.787,1.9051,3.2857,3.7817,4.4019,1.1414,3.7193,2.9499,1.864,0.6293,4.915,1.6389,3.251,3.4977,2.7039,2.6069,0.0656,0.7825,3.2508,0.9171,1.3869,4.994,0.0941,0.8034,4.3996,1.1972,2.854,4.6889,3.2147,2.301,0.3755,0.0002,5.4938,1.7275,0.4751,4.25,2.344,5.1519,3.8138,1.0571,7.1428,0.4692,1.4366,3.2435,4.1666,1.393,0.3706,0.7193]}

{"id":2524,"ended":false,"length":584,"gen_text":"When Pandora shut her box, she left one evil sealed inside. It has remained dormant to this day.\n\n\"It was in the house since she died... You can't shake it away because it's with them all the time.\"\n\nThe message is clear.\n\n\"Every time she's come back into her life she has been forced to relive the same events,\" Mr Farrar told the Royal Commission.\n\n\"At what point she's gone through multiple personality disorder it's forced her to relive this whole chain reaction.\"\n\nMr Farrar believed the box's power could be stopped with a simple piece of tape, but says the court would be forced to interpret what that tape may or may not be.\n\nPossibly more intriguing is the box's significance in the lives of some prisoners.\n\nOne inmate who died in custody in 2004, who the commission has not named, left his prison uniform in the box and also had a pair of jeans, a T-shirt, three T-shirts, a pair of socks and a bag in which to get dressed.\n\nAnother inmate who arrived at the prison after the Boxster went missing was able to work out the location of the box by listening to the conversations around it, which was set on a table.\n\nThe box is believed to have been broken into during the police investigation, and the contents moved to a storage area where the prison had no security.\n\nWhen investigators finally raided the storage area, they found that the box was full of prison clothes.\n\n\"I understand you're an expert in prison fashion - where have you been? The clothes were right there on the table, completely in the box,\" Mr Farrar said.\n\n\"The only way [they're] going to get them is to turn the box over.\n\n\"The box is still on there, the clothes are over there.

It's not going anywhere.\"\n\nThe commission has heard from one prisoner who has said the Boxster helped her cope with a suicide attempt.\n\nBut Ms Hall said it was common knowledge that some inmates found it stressful to hear their messages.\n\nShe said: \"They would be sitting in the cells, the cell doors are locked but someone can hear what's going on over in the Boxsters.\n\n\"These messages, it's not just some innocent person writing about this or that.\"\n\nMs Hall said the messages were also written in a language prisoners were not comfortable speaking, which is often the language spoken by those who have personality disorders.\n\n\"People can be disturbed by the language they have to write in. Sometimes, it's written in the inmate's own handwriting,and sometimes they are communicating a language they don't speak,\" she said.\n\n\"The Boxster gives inmates who are in the boxes, something to write about, something they can remember.\"\n\nTopics: crime, law-crime-and-justice, prisons-and-punishment, sa, canberra-2600, act, australia\n\nFirst posted","token_len":654,"entropy":[12.4591,7.9591,4.9864,7.0171,1.3372,1.719,4.6585,6.1084,10.1888,9.5311,0.871,0.8981,3.1254,3.3125,5.1383,2.7878,5.2952,0.2888,0.0496,0.6191,1.4773,0.0128,3.3155,2.9693,2.2139,4.3058,1.1852,4.9036,4.905,2.9914,1.5138,5.248,5.6768,2.0332,0.8171,5.7605,0.8116,4.0131,5.1039,0.7084,0.5035,5.6606,5.7284,3.2996,0.2415,0.0262,1.2053,0.4102,0.0001,2.4647,6.5192,2.4467,2.4259,1.1126,1.7207,0.0002,1.5336,6.0486,0.9141,2.0652,2.9832,5.729,1.1313,4.6162,2.556,1.4506,2.8825,2.1042,2.4475,4.2712,0.2282,1.8665,0.001,1.0092,1.3903,3.389,3.2382,4.0773,5.3446,2.9682,1.2604,3.0097,1.1575,6.692,0.5026,0.9729,0.0543,0.0002,0.4189,5.3231,5.5982,0.2113,4.5284,2.8185,4.5432,1.6359,6.0142,5.0488,0.1154,4.0902,0.8479,5.9675,0.1283,0.2488,0.2261,0.0005,3.6479,4.5673,6.0368,5.8826,1.8526,0.0076,0.0002,2.5487,0.1184,0.0003,0.0007,5.5809,1.5606,2.3706,3.3437,2.5426,2.1938,0.7199,4.156,2.8885,0.9904,1.8616,4.3372,0.0015,2.4863,1.9615,0.6757,5.8165,1.7155,5.696,3.8966,2.4058,3.8515,0.0405,5.555,2.9773,1.7055,0.6034,4.9918,2.4419,0.0069,0.0029,1.2643,0.247,0.0131,0.0002,5.7885,3.7463,5.1343,5.7496,1.0856,0.6197,3.7784,0.2667,4.2258,1.8867,0.84,2.4054,0.0094,3.5705,7.17,0.4833,0.0591,0.0002,3.1237,2.7389,2.8402,5.4594,0.9453,2.2113,2.2874,3.9473,2.6253,4.0401,3.418,1.0193,1.6256,2.4858,1.2141,0.1559,3.5651,2.9952,3.6214,2.585,1.2325,0.6415,0.5691,2.3439,5.7879,2.6545,0.7978,5.3157,0.0054,5.8994,2.732,0.7886,1.4772,0.0111,0.0062,1.1971,5.0381,2.4131,0.0073,0.0697,0.5813,0.7676,1.7142,0.0054,1.3686,0.7331,0.5625,5.5466,2.69,4.3225,1.6148,6.6568,1.1275,0.2753,0.0498,0.0003,3.146,0.9894,1.4528,5.6825,0.5487,1.0363,1.2265,3.3891,1.2984,4.5048,3.6421,3.1771,0.166,2.6804,3.8061,0.0073,5.2991,1.0132,1.4329,2.1969,0.0985,0.2792,0.5087,2.3327,4.3457,0.1036,0.8953,4.6506,4.289,0.7003,2.1306,2.711,2.4987,4.8965,2.7545,0.9998,1.6986,1.8332,0.0658,0.0003,1.9259,2.4791,2.059,2.7601,0.0262,0.5055,0.5724,5.4121,0.4398,3.541,1.0096,4.5846,1.0211,1.9909,1.6927,2.0138,2.163,4.2347,0.5445,1.0089,1.7413,2.7065,3.0278,2.3791,3.9554,3.3911,1.843,2.8808,1.4719,0.1026,0.0002,4.0051,4.913,3.1568,3.8847,0.2223,0.9319,0.4167,0.823,0.3431,0.3723,3.834,0.9556,0.7167,1.0175,4.4869,0.1241,4.6096,2.3627,1.9363,0.1857,0.0002,2.2654,2.4536,5.5807,3.9536,1.9959,5.0204,1.0601,0.7939,3.7252,3.5686,5.0448,3.8024,3.8466,0.368,0.7238,3.0649,4.0501,2.803,1.3324,5.1939,0.5934,2.8935,0.1245,0.3798,2.8855,6.1019,3.9416,1.6293,0.617,0.4995,0.5653,0.7041,0.0008,0.0005,0.5007,0.1907,0.0109,0.0002,0.8513,2.4798,3.0947,1.8123,5.2181,3.0295,5.6514,0.1033,1.0981,0.0143,1.0385,1.0037,1.6358,1.1223,5.8368,1.0706,0.6393,0.9245,2.3184,1.382,0.0002,0.0526,2.5341,3.1102,1.0466,3.163,4.0491,4.1608,1.3209,2.7331,2.5637,0.2404,7.9308,0.1288,1.3911,3.3217,2.6281,0.9647,3.3764,1.3222,3.7083,0.0618,3.0742,1.9356,3.6106,2.1111,3.8865,3.4012,1.7671,1.0655,3.8314,2.1361,2.235,0.0602,6.9583,1.0997,2.114,1.1839,1.923,0.2565,3.3082,1.5101,1.725,0.5008,0.0081,0.0002,1.8947,1.8448,1.1879,1.6665,2.0826,3.7674,1.8863,0.2021,2.8355,3.829,1.4392,1.0228,0.0065,3.5251,2.153,2.5491,0.1042,3.1282,3.2564,0.0298,0.6324,0.0505,0.0002,3.1759,3.6838,5.6979,1.471,2.342,0.6662,5.5528,2.0027,0.8122,3.3769,1.7653,4.1368,1.6895,4.9506,0.4193,4.3212,2.4408,5.1968,2.4189,0.0221,0.0002,2.7875,0.6127,2.8055,0.0179,2.4629,2.6072,2.4143,4.2462,1.2713,1.2572,2.6526,1.6635,3.5098,3.4482,1.127,2.2274,1.5037,4.5346,4.5532,3.0237,1.4255,2.41,0.6805,0.385,0.0287,5.0421,2.9408,0.2424,1.6219,5.4671,1.2112,0.211,0.0002,0.0247,5.6668,2.5354,3.4507,3.352,0.7394,1.779,1.7884,4.7338,4.48,2.6466,4.6088,3.2376,6.1389,1.4642,0.1764,2.7087,0.0243,0.0002,2.3451,0.0146,0.63,1.4586,3.0659,1.0818,2.9305,4.4981,1.6244,1.3541,1.9422,3.1945,2.8835,0.6253,3.5561,2.8637,1.9408,2.0928,3.775,4.1897,2.9205,1.9594,3.6362,1.2498,3.1948,1.4216,1.3237,5.6956,0.3888,0.137,0.0212,0.0002,1.2483,3.7671,3.313,1.8597,5.8456,0.767,1.7193,2.518,2.4393,2.4703,0.1788,1.5334,0.5619,2.3116,3.6019,3.3391,1.8665,0.5266,3.5424,0.2547,2.7805,5.6383,0.1368,0.4963,2.4984,1.4173,11.4087,1.4433,2.1141,3.2461,5.5626,5.6709,1.5026,1.0726,0.9191,0.0005,1.6178,1.0496,0.256,0.0749,0.0052,0.0053,0.0002,0.7682,2.7322,2.0872,0.0954,4.5099,3.0054,3.7127,1.1142,2.1642,1.9023,3.7094,3.0917,5.8918,0.603,2.7726,1.7301,1.5267,0.9887,2.9806,0.3636,4.981,1.2486,0.0168,0.0002,1.1057,0.0006,3.5878,0.0165,0.4006,0.0001,0.0,0.0001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0012,1.0177,0.0037,0.0,0.0,0.0005,0.0004,0.0044,5.4115,0.3513,2.7295,0.0096,0.0001,0.0001,0.0,0.3422,0.0135,0.5808,0.0836,0.0,0.0003,0.2476,0.0002,0.0003,0.0]}
{"id":465,"ended":false,"length":609,"gen_text":"Make up some historical or little-known fact and convince me that it's true, and i will accept it for true.\n\n\nIt goes something like this:\n\n\nThe US National Hockey League (NHL) was born on November 21, 1920 in the newly founded National Hockey League (NHL).\n\n\nThe story really began in Detroit, Mich. During the 1926\u201327 season, a fledgling hockey league, organized by Detroit's Black Hawks Club, began competing with the minor leagues in the Midwest. The Black Hawks finished in 9th place, which set up a potential battle for the championship with the NHL's Detroit Cougars.\n\n\nThe NHL's Detroit Cougars had been an expansion franchise, formed by the merger of the Toronto St. Pats and Toronto Riptide, in 1924. These new Chicago Americans were known for their brutal attitude and vicious play, and led the league in fighting majors, with 14 in 1927. Detroit also had five players who would go on to form the NHL's first Hall of Famers, including Stan Mikita, Al MacInnis, Elmer Lach and Bill Barilko.\n\n\nThe new Cougars (known as the Blues) began their inaugural season by upsetting the Black Hawks, who finished tied for 4th in the league, 2 points out of the championship. At the conclusion of the game, the NHL's president, Joe Malone, reportedly got into a heated argument with Black Hawks' president, George Richards as they watched the game on TV.\n\n\nAfter this controversial episode, Malone proposed a compromise that would make the league financially stronger if it could have 15 teams. The NFL had 10 teams, but after their merger in 1966, league membership expanded to 17 teams. The Black Hawks reluctantly agreed to drop the idea of a 15th team, and the NHL took over the newly formed American Hockey League (AHL).\n\n\nWhile the first NBA game wasn't played in 1946 (the league was formed in 1946 after the NFL merger), it was during that first year of the NHL that the NBA had their own expansion. A Detroit Pistons basketball team was the NBA's first team in 1946\u201347.\n\n\nYou might be asking yourself, \"but, wouldn't having 16 teams limit our growth and development?\" The answer is NO. If you had 16 teams, that would mean players from the West Coast and the Midwest could now play in Canada, Europe and South Africa. As a result, the NBA, along with Major League Baseball, has been growing its fanbase since its inception in 1946. The NBA is now one of the most popular sports leagues in the world, with television ratings that reach near the level of the NFL.\n\n\nIt all started with a group of fans who believed that there was enough talent in the US to compete with the best in the world. Those fans decided that the league they had the best chance of winning, and they were right! It took decades for the US to be able to compete, but thanks to the vision of the group of people who created the idea, we have finally taken the next step forward.\n\n-\n\nDid you find this interesting?

{"id":3288,"ended":true,"length":625,"gen_text":"The Narrator of your story really doesn't want to be there... but if that Narrator is really just the ghost of the man who died today because he loved us all enough to tell the story... well, that's just really, really amazing. When you have done that, that is when your story begins. [You should read and learn from the book.\n\nIt is a very good book\u2014it is so good that if it had been written in the 1940's or the 1980's it would have been a bestseller. There are a ton of anecdotes in there. They are hilarious, and sad... but there's also what we want our stories to be.\n\nWe tend to tell stories with the good guys, with the noble, with the noble-like, and the people who really stand up for us and are willing to be vulnerable and are willing to go through whatever it is we've been through... But that goes for all of us\u2014all of us, not just the heroes in this book. This book is for anyone who has ever had to go through the tough times, when life got very, very tough\u2014which is a lot of us. When your loved ones get killed (and they will), when your loved ones get sick (and they will), when your loved ones don't treat you (and they will)... it's a lot of tough times. When your job doesn't work out (and it will), when it feels like it can't get any worse (and it very well could if we don't change our habits)... it's a lot of tough times. I feel very strongly that my story is not a singularly happy one.\n\nWhat I didn't realize is that my story took place in a city called St. Louis. A city with the history of racial inequality; a city with the history of oppression. It was only when I was going through this, when you know we could be out living the life that we want to live... knowing that we have something the white majority can't have\u2014which isn't getting shot by police\u2014that it occurred to me, what else can my life be? When you have had those tough times, when you realize how alone you are, then you realize that we are all alone... and we all need to take care of each other.\n\nThese are, of course, strong words to say to people who are white, who have survived and become wealthy, if only they could just stay there, and not come from cities like St. Louis. One of my favorite parts of this book is all of these rich white people talking about losing their wealth and their status in white society. This was one of the biggest moments for me in the book. It really inspired me to want to see what it would be like to have been in my situation growing up.\n\nThis book is very, very important. It really is. I'll be recommending it to my friends, and to my colleagues.\n\nThat was a great story.

I actually started the Indie Game Magazines back in 2008. So now that I have more experience with the form, I am going to share some tips\/ideas that I have used. A few things:\n\nMake your essay conversational. As a game writer, it's your job to entertain your audience. It's important that your essay can be read as a complete work, rather than just a collection of random facts, so make sure you think about how your essay will interact with the other essays on the page.\n\n.

It's important that your essay can be read as a complete work, rather than just a collection of random facts, so make sure you think about how your essay will interact with the other essays on the page. Find your audience. How will you write essays similar to the ones above? For example, we're going to focus on games about travel and culture, because we're primarily interested in game design. That's a lot of gamers, and you might need to write about these topics in multiple ways.\n\nHow will you write essays similar to the ones above?

Writing like a professional academic helps focus and organize your thoughts, even when it's just a scribble you keep in your notebook.\n\nWriting like a professional academic helps focus and organize your thoughts, even when it's just a scribble you keep in your notebook. Create a short summary of your topic, and keep it as short as possible. When you get to your conclusion, give your readers at least 2-3 paragraphs of explanation, ideally in one paragraph.\n\nWhen you want to write more than one essay, pick one topic and write one, then another. For example, you can write about travel to a fictional place and why you are interested in it. Choose one that would really resonate with your readers, and stick with it \u2014 after all, the end result is always going to be just a piece of paper.\n\nIn conclusion, your essay is your final product, so treat it with the utmost respect.

{"id":2260,"ended":true,"length":581,"gen_text":"We detected what we thought was a near-earth asteroid - until it emitted a jet of plasma. It steered itself into Earth orbit... and then stopped. \"\n\nIt was only then that the researchers checked the telescope's cameras to confirm what they had already suspected. The asteroid did not leave a trail of debris, as the asteroid they'd seen a couple of days earlier once had.\n\n\"With this asteroid, [the telescope] just sees a jet - a bright spot in the sky that appears like it's coming from the direction of Mars.\"\n\nAnd it was actually travelling that direction. The object was so far away that the telescope couldn't see it; it would have had to be closer to study - about a solar radius - yet still be travelling at over 32,000km\/h.\n\nWhat can we learn from this?\n\nOne of the telescope's cameras captured its trajectory as it moved across Earth's sky.

It's like an explosive decompression... it's just like a pebble dropping into a hot spring.\"\n\nBut this doesn't mean that there's ever a good time to have an Earth-shaking explosion.\n\n\"I do think we can learn things from asteroid impacts, we just need to have the patience to wait over a longer period of time,\" said Dr Jenniskens. \"The science behind it may be good, but for the people who live in the area that could get rattled by that, it's a problem.\"\n\nIt would be similar to the famous 1908 Tunguska blast that killed about 28,000 people and sent clouds of dust across northern Siberia.\n\n\"Tunguska wasn't a big problem in terms of residents, but we saw it over a 30- to 40-year time-scale,\" said Dr Jenniskens.\n\nDozens of near-Earth objects are thought to have impacts on earth's atmosphere and have the potential to create tsunamis that would send humans into space, while some smaller asteroids are thought to have had the power to wipe out continents.\n\nHowever, these are not big enough to cause global disasters, and we've lived with the threat of Earth-shaking impacts on our own planet for billions of years, with no reason to believe humans will ever have to face a deadly one in the near future.\n\nWatch our video below to learn more about these mysterious objects - called NEOs - and how they impact the Earth.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Instagram.","token_len":657,"entropy":[10.676,6.5906,1.503,1.7354,0.5408,0.6622,7.9712,0.4853,3.4571,0.4497,5.5853,7.1599,1.6914,7.1412,0.6813,5.9853,0.1738,2.427,2.202,2.4648,10.357,2.1813,1.8175,3.1493,1.4124,5.9298,1.7232,1.9409,4.9238,1.5615,4.6335,1.4255,0.0065,3.8022,1.4277,3.2055,1.6836,0.2904,1.3006,3.3457,7.3586,0.8693,4.9691,0.8062,3.9848,2.6923,2.1035,2.0655,0.1079,0.5018,2.759,1.4222,1.2687,2.2578,1.2312,5.4569,0.8258,4.5496,1.0929,0.7827,0.3222,1.3165,2.0854,1.8479,2.8127,3.0916,3.6796,3.0465,1.4118,3.8481,3.6115,0.1158,1.0677,0.5138,7.8346,0.5817,0.3542,0.7475,0.0003,1.2988,5.9316,1.3698,2.0224,0.5518,6.9588,0.7692,2.7916,0.3197,4.9268,4.1841,0.8417,4.1053,3.3814,1.9322,2.8135,1.8366,2.6509,0.3457,0.2365,2.9618,4.1947,3.9384,2.2793,0.3932,1.4303,0.2361,0.792,0.7762,0.3704,3.21,2.858,0.2115,0.0002,4.1785,1.8598,1.4467,4.7247,3.8789,3.6365,1.9814,0.778,2.2705,3.9488,1.1644,4.6805,2.4077,0.3769,0.7212,1.8409,2.2361,1.6355,0.0004,1.4911,0.7235,5.7256,0.8299,3.8066,0.4865,2.6335,0.0234,0.5667,4.28,1.0646,7.0685,3.8155,3.3329,3.5502,6.7467,2.6557,2.138,5.8348,1.9065,1.951,2.7431,1.2595,3.6125,5.2478,0.2555,0.0564,0.9792,0.4037,0.1552,0.4261,0.1258,0.0003,4.3487,5.404,0.7946,0.457,0.2402,0.5042,0.3807,0.4468,0.0002,4.9062,1.0056,0.0474,6.0838,0.0643,1.6304,2.5448,6.1594,1.8688,2.3535,0.1893,2.4579,2.3088,2.3609,0.1837,0.8254,0.751,2.8544,0.002,1.722,1.4791,0.0003,3.5183,0.0345,0.0473,3.0262,0.6531,5.223,1.1072,0.1884,0.0033,2.8964,4.7546,0.6351,1.7919,1.2452,3.612,0.292,5.5541,0.8801,0.6097,5.3355,0.1805,1.1504,5.4155,5.8003,1.6721,5.6601,1.1372,4.0536,0.4322,0.9829,0.6054,2.0398,6.5766,3.5832,4.6625,0.7756,4.2916,4.7875,3.9763,0.6229,2.5675,1.7196,4.5385,0.833,5.6121,4.4999,0.0432,0.006,1.1369,0.216,1.1001,0.4234,0.2101,0.0003,1.8403,3.937,4.3014,3.5853,0.4882,0.8167,3.8182,1.7127,3.9294,1.0712,3.9891,7.0292,0.9386,0.6097,1.148,5.7576,3.4378,0.6324,3.0274,0.4903,0.0029,1.9948,0.0737,2.4048,5.2267,5.4088,5.7801,0.997,5.4875,1.4964,1.2787,0.6849,0.9096,0.0853,0.9572,2.8441,0.9717,2.3517,1.5435,5.1711,0.7406,0.0009,0.0007,2.1056,0.482,0.9004,0.0005,0.1055,1.0022,0.0733,0.0003,0.6166,2.9667,6.0755,4.8863,4.8414,4.6075,3.132,4.0358,0.1934,0.9336,2.4944,1.516,0.8149,0.3587,4.8015,4.4845,0.388,3.3328,1.6134,5.3729,2.7518,0.4005,1.7958,4.5836,2.0752,1.9792,0.0247,3.3668,1.2322,2.3621,1.3863,2.8987,3.3708,3.9794,4.5926,0.0217,4.657,2.0686,1.2486,2.9032,2.1966,1.3538,5.6721,0.0042,0.0004,4.0143,1.3576,0.7187,6.5342,1.0135,0.7712,0.0091,0.0003,3.3409,2.7911,3.1862,0.0004,0.4175,0.5436,3.4595,1.2271,5.2263,0.6359,1.7091,0.2223,0.1501,5.0755,1.2299,4.8318,0.9067,1.1409,1.2174,4.7269,0.743,0.8467,0.0002,0.4209,3.1133,4.7769,0.8172,2.2572,2.6354,0.7429,4.5168,0.442,4.8471,0.7083,1.5854,4.3933,1.126,1.2556,0.1879,3.1241,1.1941,3.1173,0.4125,1.1325,6.4275,1.4529,2.9577,0.4415,0.1448,0.0103,0.5912,0.8336,0.381,0.7509,0.0011,0.0064,0.0471,2.6534,2.8761,5.7149,4.78,1.1089,4.6387,0.9386,4.5598,0.3217,0.1178,4.0191,1.4889,2.8696,0.7523,1.1739,1.2561,0.6663,1.4057,2.5973,3.588,3.7666,5.6089,1.2006,3.3024,0.8527,0.913,0.8911,2.5112,3.7355,0.3491,0.0737,0.0002,3.7657,3.9103,0.9771,5.4189,0.1033,1.6966,5.109,1.2626,0.1067,0.0007,0.0002,0.0,3.3127,2.4974,2.0814,3.2794,5.7805,0.1385,0.0225,0.043,2.4984,3.6099,4.5193,0.0431,1.4941,3.1515,3.7055,1.0671,0.501,0.7321,0.0002,1.4627,3.3744,0.0023,0.0009,0.0014,4.2961,0.0007,1.1381,2.4784,5.1221,2.2895,2.8759,0.0021,5.7988,1.9712,0.4646,3.6292,4.4161,2.3933,4.9141,0.7126,4.2915,0.1698,3.6946,1.1125,0.0051,0.2922,2.3983,3.4234,1.219,1.102,0.5219,0.2487,0.6794,0.0012,0.0043,0.0462,0.588,0.0002,6.3313,4.5893,0.0373,4.0569,0.049,0.125,0.829,1.3278,1.9396,0.0059,2.0037,5.9463,1.0826,5.5832,3.2767,0.8819,3.1575,4.2241,1.7374,0.0663,0.0637,3.194,3.983,0.0006,0.0001,3.9303,2.0257,4.7547,3.279,1.742,2.3777,2.6378,4.8115,2.5439,3.7013,1.0599,2.1204,0.8328,0.0119,0.9156,3.2989,1.8032,1.7833,0.0562,2.0105,0.0297,4.1975,0.385,0.1609,0.0002,4.1617,0.1237,3.8474,1.8193,2.4912,4.9839,0.6174,0.2902,1.349,2.5169,3.2247,1.6752,0.9467,3.3922,2.6672,5.2499,0.2941,1.9727,0.9313,0.2227,3.9762,0.3795,0.3981,0.1342,2.0785,3.263,1.052,4.4207,0.0903,0.1469,2.2343,0.0072,0.0014,2.8793,3.2802,1.186,4.9458,0.0571,1.8851,6.2816,1.1774,2.3806,2.2429,0.1643,1.8867,2.0252,5.0782,2.8453,3.3505,1.6046,1.4591,0.0365,0.0277,0.1314,0.0002,5.3085,2.3909,1.003,2.628,0.4396,1.5114,0.1138,0.1667,3.9483,3.4873,1.9576,3.5266,5.3371,2.2435,0.0595,0.3919,0.7826,1.233,1.1318,2.9013,2.3211,0.9218,0.6925,0.7234,0.0002,1.8443,1.0259,0.0131,0.0749,0.0197,0.091,0.0336,0.0067,0.243,0.0263,0.0077,0.0002,0.0673]}

That he would use humor to make a statement that will have repercussions no matter what (including actual lawsuits) is just another annoyance.","token_len":657,"entropy":[4.6196,2.2232,4.5871,5.3547,5.6875,9.4021,1.0561,8.1161,1.0671,0.0282,12.0495,0.1979,0.0336,3.282,1.7878,2.0743,0.0249,0.009,0.0004,1.8996,1.2433,4.0193,4.499,7.0511,4.4644,0.8776,2.9174,2.7099,0.4144,0.035,0.1027,6.8085,11.0612,0.0551,2.8236,2.374,2.2609,0.387,0.834,0.0021,5.8156,0.0615,4.4247,4.3748,0.0567,0.2908,3.854,0.1862,2.8447,4.2709,0.0337,1.4781,5.5733,7.1671,0.0002,2.7004,5.4966,2.3177,0.6332,5.9135,2.0409,0.8926,0.0193,0.3418,2.1434,5.2245,1.6213,5.252,0.4256,0.7121,2.1435,0.0002,3.0263,1.6588,2.6066,0.0047,0.038,3.6252,0.0006,4.38,2.161,4.3389,1.4141,4.0371,0.4341,0.0557,0.8241,2.6769,0.0003,0.624,0.0331,0.1709,0.002,0.1338,1.1102,0.0002,2.1802,3.7352,3.3632,3.6685,5.3724,0.513,0.0224,2.4969,5.1749,0.0584,2.9254,3.1013,3.9704,0.0002,4.5316,1.5079,3.5819,0.3436,1.6086,0.0128,0.0059,0.0046,0.823,0.5942,1.163,1.3728,3.2129,0.4812,1.7482,0.0016,0.0148,1.3453,2.1316,3.8953,2.2241,5.6808,0.131,2.6258,1.181,9.2669,2.0647,0.002,0.0014,11.0227,0.1346,0.0063,0.0004,0.0008,0.0034,0.0005,0.001,0.0018,0.0008,0.0011,0.0055,0.0006,0.0005,0.0017,0.0018,0.0002,0.0008,0.0016,0.004,0.0009,0.0011,0.1647,0.0098,0.001,0.0018,0.0313,0.0004,0.0001,0.0021,0.0451,0.0001,0.0017,0.0286,1.071,0.0002,4.1416,5.0644,2.3599,0.0096,0.3034,3.6186,2.6919,0.5221,1.0597,6.5495,5.3686,1.459,3.3321,1.1379,3.7742,0.5348,0.0079,1.6432,2.4611,4.083,2.3873,0.419,0.7785,2.3361,2.1363,5.1176,1.2601,2.5117,5.1068,0.3029,6.1632,4.9882,5.2271,0.165,2.3583,1.772,1.7885,0.2781,4.5167,0.3364,0.0008,0.0013,0.0018,0.0087,0.0013,0.0016,0.0009,0.0028,0.0019,0.0014,0.0003,0.0018,0.0242,0.0005,0.0005,0.0027,0.0002,0.0006,0.0036,0.0002,0.0022,0.0059,0.0027,0.0027,0.0014,0.0018,0.0235,0.0008,0.004,0.0012,0.0021,0.001,0.0073,0.0023,0.0012,0.0012,0.264,0.0002,2.0706,4.6675,1.6257,1.898,2.1229,1.3867,0.0032,3.4462,0.3474,0.5992,3.9237,3.0635,0.7478,0.2362,1.3069,3.8613,0.0002,1.8211,2.373,0.4243,0.7419,3.0701,2.9054,1.0489,0.9394,2.3652,6.731,0.961,5.0591,3.9002,4.2002,1.3709,2.4498,0.4238,0.3373,1.9572,0.113,0.6962,1.4471,3.1428,0.0002,5.0791,2.1631,2.8444,0.6251,0.1733,5.4459,1.0801,2.1112,1.0937,0.9406,2.9015,0.01,2.2842,2.2557,4.7099,0.3712,1.6261,0.4194,0.6624,0.07,2.094,5.0624,0.3351,1.3575,0.1787,10.6009,0.0802,0.0319,1.049,0.2827,0.0066,0.0021,0.0027,0.0043,0.0679,0.0099,0.0324,0.0047,0.0026,0.0028,0.0182,0.0002,0.0035,0.0064,0.0014,0.001,0.0044,0.0044,0.0029,7.8053,0.1688,0.0086,0.0025,0.0039,0.0033,0.0092,0.0064,0.0067,0.0015,0.0012,0.0554,0.0039,0.0031,0.0319,0.3756,0.2589,0.0002,3.2492,2.5922,0.0003,0.2542,0.0986,0.0249,1.2474,1.2971,0.3352,0.6819,3.9665,3.3809,1.3952,3.7136,1.3983,1.6556,5.8014,1.6198,1.5868,0.7432,0.559,4.5606,0.6848,0.1086,3.956,0.624,0.048,0.0079,0.0865,0.0041,0.0013,0.001,0.0194,0.0017,0.0016,0.0006,0.0037,0.0054,0.0005,0.0014,0.0028,0.0028,0.0013,0.017,0.0015,0.0027,1.9504,0.0581,0.0078,0.0012,0.0023,0.0172,0.0026,0.0009,0.0013,0.0012,0.0008,0.0015,0.0014,0.0046,0.0027,0.0064,0.0076,0.0092,0.0007,0.0065,0.0055,0.0013,0.0007,0.0025,0.028,0.0054,0.7512,0.011,0.0018,0.0015,0.0016,0.0039,0.0031,0.0028,0.001,0.0011,0.0005,0.0157,0.0019,0.0024,0.0085,0.0089,0.4242,0.0095,0.0002,0.003,0.0213,0.0003,0.0012,0.0057,0.0015,0.0012,0.0041,0.0004,0.0116,0.0021,0.0014,0.0018,0.0003,0.0007,0.0006,0.0078,0.0011,0.0051,0.0001,0.0011,6.0113,1.205,2.5283,2.9209,4.9186,4.0783,0.2974,4.4549,4.6294,5.6343,0.3277,0.7919,0.7662,4.3712,4.8431,0.7743,1.8149,0.5979,0.93,3.4776,1.8284,5.2511,3.5692,1.0633,3.9527,0.0383,1.5051,4.382,2.9941,4.9655,1.0599,2.81,0.649,1.3269,0.2423,5.2978,1.6124,2.3555,0.1593,5.6744,2.8134,0.8211,1.0807,1.9346,0.1171,0.9041,1.6739,1.802,2.1531,0.0577,0.0014,4.5094,6.6112,2.3466,0.1295,1.1168,0.0157,1.362,1.9287,2.067,1.4334,6.5686,0.1725,0.6244,0.436,0.1765,0.413,0.0002,4.7126,0.0161,0.0489,3.8749,4.532,4.2323,5.5963,0.3236,5.6042,0.8836,1.8415,0.7195,1.8901,2.249,3.3725,0.0003,3.9242,0.2379,1.1306,2.5646,0.0003,0.0017,0.0044,0.0186,0.0003,0.0004,0.0012,0.0008,0.0006,0.0006,0.0013,0.0026,0.0028,0.0043,0.0003,0.0042,0.0008,0.0011,4.3217,4.3051,1.0933,2.4291,3.2184,1.052,0.3444,0.8316,0.9181,5.1276,1.8642,0.1131,0.001,0.105,1.5336,4.1057,5.1047,0.8771,0.6811,0.0002,2.6475,5.6174,1.4169,2.1853,1.4663,2.0169,2.1516,4.2066,5.2709,4.278,0.8898,2.2839,5.1115,0.8099,0.0541,0.5902,4.019,3.3679,0.0025,1.3366,3.5854,0.0037,0.108,1.3357,1.0266,4.0933,0.7606,1.7484,5.1833,5.167,0.7292,4.1966,2.6259,0.427,3.6822,3.4597,0.4028,2.1959,1.1003,3.0556,1.1673,4.7116,2.9821,2.91,5.9519,0.1348,0.6815,6.3804,4.0628,5.6051,5.4379,0.3762,0.4262,2.3892,3.6958,4.8312,0.3049]}
{"id":2930,"ended":false,"length":615,"gen_text":"The news just broke on the latest celebrity suicide. It's the president of the United States.\n\nJust one day after the president's brother and close advisor, John Kelly, told NBC News that President Trump has been \"disturbed\" by the way Trump-family members have spoken about him, family members of other recent celebrity suicides \u2014 Jason Mraz, Prince \u2014 have all spoken out and slammed the president.\n\nJason Mraz:\n\nWhen I saw his tweet that he was leaving for a 6-month jaunt\u2026I just knew. It was a no-brainer. I'm so devastated I can't even get myself together enough to type the rest of this. A few things: 1. Please don't do this. 2. I know your brother is a great man and he loves us all with his deep and abiding love. He would never wish us to take our own lives. 3. Love, Jason\n\nPrince:\n\nOur father, who has been so kind during this difficult period, has recently been found to have given a series of private and public interviews about the state of his family. These interviews were conducted after Prince publicly confronted his father regarding accusations of domestic violence. On August 8th, one week before our father's death, Prince shared on social media the transcript of his father's interview with NBC News. In these statements, Prince alleges that despite the death of his mother on July 17th, 2015 and two days before our father's untimely death, Prince's father allegedly had an inappropriate relationship with a female employee of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Prince also alleges that despite the death of Prince's mother the night before, his father remained romantically involved with this woman.\n\nNow my dad is dead. And in the interview which was supposed to clear up this nonsense is the same guy who gave us that false statement about my father that led to this whole narrative. And I can't even \u2014 just \u2014 it's too depressing. It's just too bad that this is the guy that we could bring up in the interview that could help clear this up. To try and prove that something was wrong with my father and that it was a lie. I mean, do you guys really believe he'd lie about my father? The guy that has had one heart attack.

{"id":218,"ended":true,"length":583,"gen_text":"On her deathbed, your ill mother finally allows you to own the recipe to her famous cookies. It reads : `` 2 cups flour, 1\/4 teaspoon salt, and a human heart. ''\nBaking is a laborious way to kill people, especially the young\nBut what happens when you bake them up for yourself? I never thought to bake for my mother in the time she was alive, and until now have never remembered.\nWith this simple recipe you could bake cookies for yourself. The only ingredients are flour, sugar and yeast. It's quite easy to make and can give you a great taste for your own grandmother or mother. The dough can be divided in parts using a standard cookie cutter and shaped with a rolling pin. It can also be rolled, with a rolling pin, into balls and baked or cut into rectangular loaves with a large pizza cutter. These loaves are called ''bread'' or ''bundt pans'' and give you a great deal of flexibility and control.\nI bought these, as well as the traditional recipes, from The Baking Network : http:\/\/dishinabar.com\/product\/baking-network\/\nThis is a recipe for German chocolate bundt pan, 3'' round.\nIngredients 2 cups (240 grams or 6 ounces) all-purpose flour, divided 2 1\/4 teaspoons baking powder 1 (5 tablespoon) sugar 1\/2 teaspoon salt 2 (5 ounces) sticks butter, cold 6 ounces dark chocolate 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate (Chantilly) 1 egg white 1 glass (60 ml) milk, cold (or buttermilk)\nDirections Heat a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat.\nMix flour, baking powder and sugar together in a bowl.\nAdd melted butter, chocolate and dark chocolate and stir well with a whisk; season with salt.\nTurn heat to medium and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nRemove from heat and stir in egg white until smooth and just set over the melted chocolate.\nPour into ungreased Bundt pan. Place in refrigerator to cool.\nUsing a knife or cookie cutter slice cookies; arrange in pan in any orientation.\nBake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for about 2 hours or until crisp. Let cool on wire rack before serving.\nChocolate Bundt Pan Cookies\n1 4 oz package (8 cookies) white chocolate, melted 1 cup butter, cold 1 medium egg white 1 1\/2 cup all purpose flour 1 1\/2 cups sugar 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, optional\nDirections Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Line a large nonstick 12\" round cookie sheet with foil and set aside.\nWhip melted chocolate until smooth and smooth. Add butter and mix until all combined.\nAdd egg white, flour and sugar and stir just until combined. Pour into prepared cookie sheet (if not using chocolate chips) and spread evenly. Top the cookie sheet with foil, then crack a small hole in the foil, keeping the cookies stacked. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until cookies are lightly browned. Let cool on wire rack.\nYou can also use chocolate chips in place of the chocolate chips.","token_len":658,"entropy":[5.769,4.5622,0.4355,0.2801,8.3501,10.6062,2.7374,6.6028,6.473,0.3819,0.1664,7.283,1.8217,8.336,2.6023,1.1626,2.1333,5.662,0.5881,4.0658,7.1784,6.9241,8.5221,8.9212,1.3702,1.5306,0.8845,0.8429,1.2199,1.2383,2.0905,0.7996,0.2894,4.2211,3.4406,13.4864,4.3901,1.1918,4.9867,2.367,6.2794,2.1917,2.7675,1.6196,4.4577,0.9391,6.7811,0.3716,3.7716,2.3558,1.2608,3.7268,3.1999,3.353,5.117,4.5277,3.6291,3.4777,0.5675,0.958,2.1841,3.1136,4.7062,3.3952,2.8928,0.3133,3.8499,5.4007,2.5956,2.4396,1.88,3.1229,1.5778,1.4212,4.3831,1.9071,5.4092,2.2725,0.7694,1.2786,0.889,1.8596,5.8778,1.6045,4.4445,0.8681,5.7238,1.6724,2.2313,5.341,2.9027,4.7836,0.9311,2.0593,3.9847,2.7368,3.5807,0.8095,1.5003,2.4463,3.0846,2.6795,3.1379,0.9024,0.8174,0.3825,2.0559,1.5914,4.8363,0.3672,3.3586,1.4157,4.3043,1.177,0.7449,0.7941,1.7057,3.395,5.5736,0.4863,0.9312,3.972,3.2197,2.9879,1.6441,1.6038,4.0452,3.4259,1.405,0.5705,3.492,2.981,1.6534,0.2037,4.897,1.9984,5.5024,5.9664,0.5754,5.2321,0.7318,0.2874,1.6601,4.0226,2.5124,0.336,1.3251,0.0031,0.408,3.5513,1.3345,1.7344,0.0268,2.1497,4.5422,5.995,1.2638,1.1216,0.0041,0.4303,0.4395,1.371,1.2379,0.6413,5.0867,3.3856,0.2884,5.7615,5.4648,0.0037,3.296,0.1508,5.0769,5.1609,0.0802,0.1967,4.6792,2.517,0.0001,1.8242,3.1792,3.1453,5.1255,1.9169,2.5733,0.5263,2.1308,4.2983,0.2484,4.8297,0.5016,0.9246,5.9995,1.2907,0.6868,1.7212,3.8556,0.0829,2.0786,2.9991,2.5219,0.8174,0.9068,3.1084,5.2906,2.7548,5.972,3.3608,1.3885,0.0381,1.5523,4.8312,3.8872,0.618,0.7087,3.3186,3.0394,0.2849,3.9164,3.6198,1.8071,0.0021,7.2684,4.9697,4.0658,2.9211,3.6032,0.1606,1.1323,0.1202,5.9998,0.5834,2.053,0.2315,0.378,0.3025,0.6505,1.049,3.5098,1.3552,1.1061,2.7662,0.9236,6.221,3.1467,2.8429,0.0208,1.0008,3.162,5.9566,3.5005,3.3582,1.7046,1.3071,2.2464,3.2402,0.2505,2.2591,3.0629,1.7288,3.1177,3.2806,0.9563,0.148,1.1357,0.2119,0.0009,0.0992,1.6668,2.6237,2.2732,2.6273,0.0051,1.2336,0.584,1.3464,0.1725,0.3577,7.0566,3.2354,4.0176,0.223,2.144,0.5298,1.516,0.5461,0.1655,0.1552,1.9318,3.5223,3.7519,3.1051,1.0212,2.075,2.7306,0.3167,2.6685,5.7216,1.0941,2.0489,0.1723,5.7167,0.3096,1.7334,0.0483,0.0051,0.0633,2.5919,5.9033,1.155,0.0573,0.936,1.7443,1.7534,1.7896,1.4099,7.7231,1.1466,2.46,0.433,0.2451,0.6073,2.3892,2.0518,2.9448,1.9624,3.2427,0.0013,0.0002,0.2198,0.974,1.7899,0.0006,3.5719,2.7422,1.049,1.9226,0.8866,0.7173,0.3213,5.3389,0.1752,0.015,0.3786,2.6988,3.262,1.1793,0.1634,0.2721,0.0074,0.6721,0.3808,1.4978,0.717,0.0923,1.5444,0.4953,1.5665,1.0976,3.7356,0.0359,1.925,0.3465,0.5359,4.1575,0.0249,0.929,0.8152,2.8199,2.4513,0.0527,2.1089,5.0782,4.8747,0.1028,0.0863,0.8032,0.4577,3.7629,1.9842,0.4527,0.3822,1.4354,1.7562,2.7395,1.1515,2.0974,0.4464,0.0048,0.6118,1.0053,2.5144,0.6933,0.5568,1.8998,0.1133,0.1178,0.4909,0.6895,0.0249,0.2453,0.144,2.5879,1.2134,2.2013,5.1357,2.7907,6.7914,1.0863,3.7378,0.0433,0.2474,0.3593,1.9692,0.0162,1.3341,6.101,0.014,0.0001,1.8196,0.0026,0.1075,0.8737,3.6542,1.0189,1.8195,1.0598,1.4979,0.5985,0.3864,4.543,0.3384,3.065,1.4441,1.7081,0.2415,7.3448,4.703,6.8269,3.6361,1.0856,1.8312,2.6633,3.0545,4.8504,1.4476,0.6547,1.1917,0.0626,1.4033,0.4379,0.7911,1.2899,1.5232,1.7406,0.1156,0.0129,0.0858,0.2155,2.185,4.8862,0.8821,1.0487,0.017,4.6344,0.8783,3.2227,0.1738,1.6754,1.1444,0.264,2.7252,0.8692,0.067,0.6527,3.0715,0.1817,0.619,0.0152,0.6452,3.1686,0.936,1.9695,6.6366,2.2516,1.3667,1.6003,2.5246,1.0806,0.1525,3.5307,0.2379,1.4891,2.1488,1.5861,1.3113,3.584,0.4924,1.1648,0.8953,6.1224,0.1565,1.2396,0.5957,2.1343,0.0058,0.3677,2.494,2.3457,2.2483,0.0099,0.5634,1.9209,0.0034,0.2556,1.2202,0.6491,1.7254,2.21,2.3523,0.202,4.0004,1.9805,1.2406,0.7144,0.0003,1.7622,0.0076,0.0512,0.0238,0.157,0.169,0.116,0.2439,0.0501,0.0165,0.0037,0.1831,1.0786,0.6162,2.1294,3.7772,0.2725,4.3874,1.3502,2.227,2.8256,0.1033,0.0595,3.3654,1.8641,0.8954,0.007,0.0261,0.4819,5.4154,0.459,4.6903,0.5946,2.5429,0.1046,1.667,2.313,0.4728,1.5642,0.4628,0.3695,2.2931,0.5414,6.5894,1.9237,0.1362,1.2101,1.1568,0.4229,0.0463,2.1332,0.6218,1.145,0.3346,0.7917,1.4204,2.7817,0.0584,0.293,0.1191,3.5231,0.8394,0.4334,1.4527,0.0971,4.8703,4.5481,3.4632,0.1041,3.2825,2.3683,2.3425,0.1567,0.8156,1.0123,0.4284,5.6222,4.8894,2.3244,0.1578,0.0892,4.4355,2.4619,2.6614,5.5496,2.1194,1.742,0.6855,0.24,0.1848,0.8947,2.6865,6.0746,0.5378,3.2957,4.9217,1.3883,1.131,4.9387,0.9381,0.6058,0.0137,1.3079,0.9508,0.0063,2.1809,0.3242,2.3372,0.1982,0.0935,0.888,1.22,0.0506,0.7383,0.2418,0.0168,0.9095,0.5366,4.879,0.407,1.4604,1.4298,2.1347,0.1025,2.0721,0.2415,0.0027,0.6532,1.1073,1.1256,1.0163]}

See also Un-Human, Un-Cute. May overlap with A Tale of the Time Traveler, or have The One Where It's Like A Fairy Tale. Frequently confused with Aliens Are Friendly.

Most famously, a story where you were in a world where you were a cow instead of a human, and every once in awhile you'd have to go into the other world... only to find that it's overrun with cows, and they had no problem with you invading their world and enslaving them.\n\nAn issue of the newspaper comic strip Sunday Watchmen has a story where the main character's sister-in-law died in childbirth. During the first few days, she went into a deep coma, and when you came to, she had died of pneumonia. She is still able to talk, and at one point, she starts speaking to a stranger on the street, where she's revealed to be working on a project that will save the world by curing cancer!\n\nGarfield: In one strip, Garfield is in a hospital having surgery, and is informed that his father is still alive in the hospital; at the end of the strip, one of his father's cronies calls Garfield and informs him that he will die in the next issue of Garfield, only a week away. Garfield is surprised, but just shrugs. That is, until he finds out that Garfield can remember just a little bit about where he is; he remembers that he's now sitting on his mother's couch, with a big box of sandwiches.\n\nFan Works\n\nFilms \u2014 Live-Action\n\nLiterature\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nMusic\n\n\"Tales from the Crypt\" : John Carpenter's The Thing is a very creepy adaptation of the H. P. Lovecraft story, mostly because there's much more in the Lovecraft story written for \"The Thing,\" but also because Carpenter decided that he did not want the story to be creepy, and instead wanted it to be dark and mysterious. The creepiness comes by way of a very unnerving piano theme that accompanies much of the book, with the only explanation being that it's a haunting.\n\nPinballs\n\nIn Stern Pinball's Horror-themed Stern Stars, there are two stories on the table.\n\nProfessional Wrestling","token_len":659,"entropy":[12.6182,11.9375,4.2337,9.7581,2.2405,6.551,8.4135,5.0298,4.2701,0.9186,5.4373,2.1654,3.2839,6.7467,3.8185,2.811,2.818,9.4447,0.9991,1.5348,0.0273,4.2523,5.0435,5.0929,2.2292,4.4422,1.5529,4.4522,5.6525,0.0011,1.7105,3.9675,4.7578,1.0443,3.7536,1.6067,2.8295,0.8209,2.8523,3.9677,0.0408,5.4294,0.3109,5.4982,0.8465,2.0657,4.3499,0.4446,3.4492,3.6753,5.5159,1.4699,1.3491,1.939,2.8786,0.7998,3.8724,0.9591,1.1572,0.0001,3.6922,5.1334,3.2802,0.4383,3.1834,7.5132,3.92,1.8457,1.8456,0.0002,2.4724,3.5731,5.4405,0.9101,5.3856,3.2144,7.2947,3.9986,5.7381,2.7292,1.4485,4.771,2.2635,0.0375,0.6663,2.0055,0.1413,5.5455,4.6985,3.9685,2.7823,1.5766,0.5143,4.0976,0.6489,1.7703,3.1094,1.6793,0.051,4.5688,5.8209,0.1384,3.506,4.6941,0.5703,0.1109,1.9339,4.3081,5.025,4.6628,4.5005,1.1331,2.8802,1.5651,3.6121,4.8162,3.1712,0.4537,0.5509,5.6119,0.016,4.9197,0.0535,4.4132,0.3875,4.8718,0.6038,4.1652,1.7434,3.5829,3.2015,2.4983,5.258,0.0274,3.8597,5.1589,1.0776,3.104,0.3587,1.1033,3.6474,5.1865,0.2535,5.1041,0.114,5.5734,4.0022,0.5737,0.8181,1.5949,0.2389,2.8317,2.3057,4.839,4.9583,4.1078,0.8645,4.4913,2.5713,3.5801,0.0982,0.0697,6.3444,0.0716,2.3545,0.0019,0.3375,0.0091,0.1314,0.0421,0.0039,0.2097,0.414,0.0002,4.1497,6.6022,1.0044,0.9751,1.8011,4.1882,4.8481,2.1072,0.7623,4.8691,5.9149,3.3442,2.0154,4.6877,4.1656,4.0378,0.4475,1.7577,0.9419,0.0002,0.5844,1.581,0.0002,0.017,0.0002,0.0001,0.0001,0.0,0.0006,0.0002,0.37,0.001,0.6065,0.0012,0.0034,0.0003,0.579,0.0982,0.0222,0.001,0.0003,2.5659,0.0176,0.0042,0.0001,0.0005,0.0002,2.7783,3.8877,0.5618,2.9083,1.7242,0.0145,1.8715,0.7233,4.1551,4.1095,1.5593,1.1668,3.9263,2.3255,0.5,2.2047,2.4524,1.4725,5.9833,2.8103,3.1435,0.4066,4.1571,0.3655,3.209,1.2831,1.5026,4.6514,6.2753,0.0056,0.1083,1.1418,1.4706,0.8899,4.9052,4.1686,0.0229,2.3939,1.1607,1.1419,2.6106,0.5232,2.2048,2.9743,1.5813,3.8756,0.5734,5.3792,2.8011,0.2194,0.911,1.1623,1.5102,1.8922,4.3264,0.6879,2.0537,2.2601,0.7446,2.3073,5.0153,3.8355,3.2432,1.787,0.993,4.5932,0.2679,0.8794,2.6866,4.3597,0.0003,0.2601,0.476,0.9681,0.0002,5.0698,2.3608,0.0248,3.3447,5.3529,0.5941,1.9357,5.4873,5.8012,3.3364,1.837,1.1461,1.8093,0.8109,1.3712,2.0948,0.1625,4.0049,4.5527,4.5879,0.0166,0.0024,0.0065,5.7491,1.4826,3.1304,0.9065,4.8016,0.8607,4.1824,1.6726,1.4161,1.2625,1.3241,4.9339,1.137,0.8611,3.2209,2.0412,1.0218,1.0915,2.249,5.6769,2.521,0.488,2.4576,0.5167,2.3239,2.4366,2.8725,4.1088,0.3164,3.0741,4.0444,3.4416,6.1781,0.0093,1.324,1.1161,1.61,4.6186,0.9262,0.023,1.9665,1.0559,4.2449,3.9721,1.6101,2.7724,4.561,2.2312,0.1942,1.6424,1.5386,5.8016,1.8827,3.4441,5.1761,0.201,0.2643,5.9496,2.8223,0.4778,3.363,1.9756,1.0747,2.4611,0.4522,0.1747,3.5428,3.9016,1.3153,5.4466,1.01,0.0003,5.2425,0.0055,0.905,1.4976,1.0929,0.8727,0.2337,0.5142,1.6319,2.5772,0.6114,3.2575,4.3087,1.9256,1.6482,0.6261,2.7214,4.0735,0.4846,1.2824,3.3662,1.3938,3.3675,0.2948,3.0575,1.5038,2.0213,5.4173,4.5777,0.8413,0.5608,0.2469,0.084,0.0905,0.1703,5.4818,0.1021,1.0672,4.0472,0.0284,4.5668,0.1555,4.1935,2.034,1.514,2.5148,0.0147,0.136,1.7017,3.9232,2.7927,1.8651,1.1814,0.5815,4.4917,3.0094,0.3898,1.4676,5.229,2.9193,2.2285,1.0157,0.3283,1.5575,2.3019,4.0364,1.1784,1.2471,5.4614,4.0987,0.0003,2.3363,5.8516,3.2345,0.6198,0.3574,1.1533,2.7526,0.4494,0.4837,3.5536,5.0161,5.6493,6.0335,2.9823,1.9261,0.312,1.2553,5.0851,0.2489,0.8742,4.0503,1.3369,3.2291,0.9673,0.5294,0.8396,5.6168,5.6917,1.4874,1.7477,4.8973,0.0589,3.8736,0.7968,3.675,1.7098,3.5705,2.8615,0.3236,5.5791,2.5297,0.9651,0.0002,1.3039,0.1454,0.001,0.0003,0.6034,0.0007,0.0186,2.1785,0.029,0.0007,0.0003,0.0002,0.2767,0.0005,0.0011,0.0003,0.1173,0.1668,0.0014,0.0019,0.0015,0.0002,0.398,0.0156,0.0003,3.0822,4.7108,2.8048,1.4904,0.3122,1.5294,0.2403,5.2507,5.4683,1.2674,1.1604,2.9779,0.0646,2.0652,1.305,3.8222,3.1101,5.5761,0.165,1.7648,0.7088,0.005,2.2165,0.0012,0.0012,0.6133,1.8683,6.4567,0.808,4.5039,0.8395,5.8265,0.3992,3.7178,1.0255,3.2682,0.6453,6.5366,3.7765,5.7721,0.5502,0.0432,3.5905,2.1454,1.2308,0.1635,3.2513,4.5133,2.5729,1.5315,4.8931,0.1255,0.1991,2.526,2.2804,0.2102,0.6207,5.1849,1.7398,1.8089,2.0576,0.7944,0.7774,0.0298,0.1158,3.9494,0.5944,3.3974,0.5854,2.0374,5.4609,0.1383,1.1225,6.1338,1.5777,0.0046,2.4073,3.4421,4.98,0.0533,5.236,3.0052,1.5961,3.7121,5.5881,0.0105,0.0757,4.5805,1.0711,4.0039,1.6946,3.8179,4.5732,0.3104,0.1948,1.1713,0.6325,1.8503,3.2021,2.1467,1.0103,0.0002,3.2771,0.4435,0.0011,0.0002,1.8614,2.3496,0.0081,0.0094,5.1743,4.4174,0.5827,3.6727,5.0434,1.1753,2.7527,1.6601,1.4625,3.8359,4.815,0.3467,2.2032,1.3734,4.3632,0.0001,3.0466,0.0031]}

One was of a man buried just six feet from the edge of the tomb, and the other, four feet away, was that of another man.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

''\n\nMr. Bortz, whose father had lived on the northern border of France, said he was trying to find a way to claim the burial spot on the French side of the village in order to erect a monument there as well. Even after three decades of searching, he has yet to reach agreement with the village council about naming the village after him.\n\n''This is a very sensitive issue for me,'' Mr. Bortz said, but he said he expected his claim to be approved in the long run.\n\nMr. Bonnet is the first to say that finding a gravesite on the French side of the village will not solve his problem. In his case, however, the claim was rejected by the council, which argued that it was unlikely that the tombstone would ever have been used at the site of the body.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe court also rejected a claim by Jean-Charles Coignet, a village resident whose father was buried there. When he and his wife, Sylvie Coignet, visited the village just a few weeks ago to locate the tombstone of their father, they found no trace of it.\n\n''We took quite a walk,'' Sylvie Coignet, 58, said. ''We searched the village by horse... but it was found that there was no tombstone of this person.''\n\nThe French authorities believe that the tombstone was removed before the cemetery's construction in 1958, replaced by a new monument that bears Mr. Coignet's name, which the council apparently did not oppose approving.\n\nIn the present dispute, Mr. Bonnet and his wife are seeking permission to

If no new states are found in a month, new tour locations in the following month will be posted.\n\nIf you have any special requests for book maps or any other questions please E-mail (charlotte.w.morrison@hotmail.com).","token_len":659,"entropy":[5.177,5.8266,3.2018,0.4185,6.1271,2.7503,1.3058,13.1771,1.514,0.1248,0.0062,1.5098,4.9202,7.0956,3.4389,5.3733,0.0263,0.0335,4.9488,7.1892,5.3665,0.3647,1.0872,2.9998,3.6398,4.7306,0.924,2.166,4.7143,1.1304,1.0284,1.7054,4.2065,1.6526,0.044,8.3672,1.4928,3.7367,0.0154,0.9894,3.9898,2.8496,4.46,4.4557,0.5115,2.3483,2.0048,3.8676,2.7424,0.0101,0.0091,0.8145,3.4247,0.0103,3.4895,3.0223,1.4278,2.4367,5.8331,4.8921,0.9103,2.31,1.3458,0.4613,3.9252,0.9894,1.4217,4.9572,1.7176,4.5322,3.9478,2.4937,2.4251,3.7011,1.9371,0.0002,3.0228,2.6954,0.8584,5.6702,0.3278,2.6227,1.0794,0.0002,3.9699,5.9984,2.3482,6.5766,5.4748,4.9998,0.9569,6.088,0.0541,2.1029,2.9673,7.0572,1.124,2.9397,3.1839,1.4426,5.2352,3.3317,2.5137,4.0903,2.9131,2.6416,4.0243,1.8228,4.6581,1.3205,3.1632,0.923,1.5269,1.2065,4.4028,1.503,5.4256,4.192,0.5148,4.2243,0.6685,4.0675,5.2369,5.1903,1.6552,0.6142,2.2127,2.1943,4.6859,2.41,5.22,2.6085,2.7553,2.292,3.0868,1.6522,0.6777,1.7718,1.5057,3.453,2.2207,2.9779,6.3198,0.1451,0.3528,1.6904,0.9151,2.953,5.2685,0.779,0.2352,1.2397,0.0002,0.6546,2.1658,4.6121,3.5867,1.3314,3.513,3.2945,0.9779,0.8805,0.6604,2.0192,0.1753,0.5088,1.8308,0.0442,2.5149,1.1235,1.9988,1.9659,0.5446,6.2597,0.1848,0.2187,0.1839,1.9254,0.0041,0.0061,1.0059,0.0885,2.1509,4.3635,0.187,0.148,0.0002,0.2897,5.7761,0.4239,3.2459,0.0538,1.7593,2.2007,0.0543,7.5045,2.2049,0.0297,0.1762,0.0002,0.2676,2.3698,1.659,4.1903,2.2815,1.4492,2.7242,2.3692,2.71,0.0915,0.9354,0.4,0.923,0.9162,3.9122,0.929,0.3828,4.684,1.646,1.7172,1.2264,0.0198,3.5335,2.5541,1.6859,1.5446,5.4785,0.9607,4.0638,0.4385,0.049,0.801,1.5637,0.1391,2.9563,3.4082,1.8363,0.138,1.8842,4.5352,4.0121,1.4547,0.0915,0.3755,4.8994,1.3463,3.5987,0.0014,3.3377,0.4372,1.59,1.9271,1.3996,5.5912,2.2826,1.2274,7.451,0.6644,1.3713,0.7784,5.5646,1.1376,2.9257,0.8296,1.0234,3.1216,0.608,6.2375,0.6852,2.5031,3.507,2.595,7.158,0.9545,7.0934,5.1709,2.9098,0.0145,4.0047,5.5768,0.9482,0.4179,0.0002,0.5681,3.1815,3.3258,1.7662,0.1768,0.5658,1.9523,0.0843,0.4341,1.1211,0.038,0.7712,0.3307,0.0227,1.1471,0.9282,2.3828,3.2637,6.5112,0.1847,3.9487,0.0003,0.6731,5.7111,2.0573,1.541,2.5937,2.0348,1.7333,2.2341,1.1053,4.989,1.7014,2.999,2.317,4.3097,0.239,0.804,5.7335,0.7661,6.369,1.5815,5.7614,0.0233,0.0551,0.7646,2.4622,3.2425,5.3331,5.0477,2.138,2.9267,0.4927,2.8612,8.3321,0.4473,0.8113,5.9359,3.1146,0.5574,1.9002,1.2119,0.2268,3.8253,1.7948,0.0104,2.405,3.052,2.6776,0.721,4.5434,3.8637,0.7923,3.7285,0.0741,1.6175,2.5913,1.1567,1.4771,4.9569,2.4095,0.2233,2.5796,4.1371,0.704,2.5219,2.1393,1.5646,3.741,4.703,1.1559,1.5538,4.4455,0.6508,0.1727,2.445,0.6001,4.0453,5.0371,1.769,1.0064,0.7071,1.025,0.0003,0.3521,3.0646,4.1842,2.6357,0.9956,1.0298,1.3096,1.0111,0.0492,0.4216,0.9603,0.0537,0.2246,3.2378,0.3454,0.005,0.6568,3.1762,3.8985,0.2746,3.6817,3.6456,4.5106,0.2588,0.458,0.0002,0.2153,1.9415,6.7512,5.1313,1.3701,4.2373,4.2757,0.8667,2.1824,4.2085,5.3047,3.5957,1.45,2.9302,1.733,4.3038,0.0045,4.6204,3.1118,1.1924,4.7308,0.5794,0.9088,5.4314,1.1998,0.3194,0.0029,0.0142,0.0037,0.24,0.9007,2.6583,1.695,0.7773,3.9956,0.5603,1.3322,0.2946,0.6799,0.9916,0.4576,0.0271,0.339,2.8878,4.2879,0.1702,1.6262,0.0871,5.2476,2.1104,0.0294,0.0894,0.3319,0.0003,6.6328,0.2147,1.6682,6.519,4.368,5.873,3.4809,6.0885,4.5519,3.8292,6.2706,3.6145,3.6516,5.8956,3.0622,3.1804,3.6333,1.4841,3.6762,2.31,0.7566,1.1072,2.8367,5.0306,0.0127,0.02,4.987,0.8986,0.9398,2.4305,0.7894,4.0226,1.8669,0.0378,0.0086,1.1116,5.0978,0.9306,0.8786,1.4589,2.538,1.6901,1.2158,1.5137,2.906,0.4511,0.0921,0.0973,2.7187,0.7934,5.4102,1.2034,0.0024,1.5911,5.2048,6.1163,1.4555,7.5111,2.9639,2.6087,4.2357,3.7545,5.7842,1.5672,0.823,1.5898,1.7074,0.436,6.2083,1.6187,1.4829,0.0002,3.906,0.5814,3.025,5.328,2.5913,0.3703,4.1538,0.0048,0.1174,4.3104,2.1536,3.4941,1.7447,2.3012,0.3626,2.6347,3.403,0.4058,1.6937,1.1213,2.0211,0.0015,5.2642,0.902,4.0308,1.899,0.9267,5.9232,1.2806,3.4768,4.6411,1.4212,3.4696,1.1164,1.0876,0.1879,2.0441,2.3524,3.3644,4.7543,1.8712,3.5689,4.8734,1.734,2.8674,0.2285,0.4626,1.2005,2.8524,0.0003,4.879,1.3618,5.8211,0.8368,3.5926,1.8916,3.3046,0.6519,0.0156,2.5915,3.2651,0.5953,0.84,0.3274,3.45,7.4786,3.3878,0.1904,0.3509,2.2101,2.2135,0.838,1.7888,0.3735,6.6643,3.4627,0.961,5.9715,1.0958,3.1641,0.3555,0.2637,0.0717,1.5626,0.7011,1.4295,0.0002,2.5484,0.175,1.2655,0.8087,5.4623,0.4493,0.884,5.2461,4.6907,1.3322,2.8414,0.3103,2.6867,3.7057,6.2564,0.0198,0.1593,7.4455,5.3227,1.8244,2.2714,2.3795,3.9624,1.3527,5.7365,1.9361,0.296,4.3212,0.0007,0.0036,0.0464,0.9747]}
{"id":3160,"ended":true,"length":575,"gen_text":"You have a super power and already mastered it when you are young. Why are you still unheard of?\n\nBecause your birth date is way too early to be able to pull off a stunt like that. In fact most people are lucky to have their own super powers.\n\nThere is a new version of the classic Super-God that is making headlines. How do you feel about this new and exciting Super-God?\n\nI love the new Super-God, you just have to give me half a chance to defeat this new super being. The first new SUPER-God was more powerful and deadly, but he had never been exposed for fear of being exposed. If a new one got out of secrecy, he or she may be even harder to defeat.\n\nWhy do you think that people keep calling him SUPER-GOD?\n\nJust give me half a chance to defeat him, I can be defeated with ease, there is no need to make the public worried about me. This super being is a threat.\n\nHow many Super-Gods exist?\n\nThere are about 500 super beings in the worlds, like me, they are not all from your Earth.\n\nHow can a Super-Googol exist?\n\nSuper-Gods are infinite in number.\n\nSuper-Googol can be broken down into smaller pieces if this new Super-God is really powerful, there could be hundreds of super Googol, thousands of super Googol. They can be broken down, but this one is extremely powerful, and he is in our world very soon. Maybe after he has defeated me, the rest of them will also be defeated in a few months.\n\nAre there more Super-Gods in the future?\n\nThis Super-God could appear in the future, but he has already broken through many super googol, this one could be the strongest one. The only thing that makes this one stronger is he knows you are going to be afraid of him, which could be possible.\n\nWhat will become of you after the Super-googols lose the fight with you?\n\nWhat if I am defeated? Who will take the world from my hands? But if my power is too powerful for you, one of the other Super-Gods will try to take it from you. You will not be able to protect the country if you are in a hurry. If one of these Super-Gods is really strong it could kill everyone in this world.\n\nI think it is worth fighting if it is for that reason.\n\nWhat about you, what do you think will happen to me when the two Super-googol's fight each other? What about your powers? Have you noticed a big change in your strength after they fight?\n\nI don't have a special ability that I cannot explain to you, no I don't have a power that I am in the middle of training right now. I have just been training in order to become strong. Once I will have developed that power, they will have no chance to defeat me. You will not be able to prevent me from defeating them, and no one will be able to stop me.","token_len":660,"entropy":[3.305,2.3842,7.3562,3.1327,2.9261,8.8428,6.0847,0.4221,6.7922,0.4779,2.7848,3.5621,0.8706,4.291,2.7516,0.0935,1.5428,12.8533,0.5814,1.1444,1.5672,0.0098,3.1532,2.7925,5.8363,2.8897,0.4953,4.7367,1.0004,2.5184,2.5281,1.1688,3.5961,0.0037,5.2466,0.5735,1.7242,3.7014,0.0477,0.7804,0.427,4.7457,1.0256,6.3791,0.9717,2.4212,4.8246,0.7824,1.5312,2.124,3.0331,0.997,1.6317,2.0847,1.0466,0.0001,4.4494,1.3284,1.0103,4.6148,5.6261,0.0829,1.3117,5.0138,2.8297,3.0868,4.729,2.5989,1.4184,4.7592,3.3146,1.3644,5.9999,2.3283,0.1478,1.0633,0.0525,1.1151,0.549,4.9349,2.928,1.9462,0.1234,0.0813,0.3148,0.308,0.0001,0.9929,2.4903,1.5405,0.2985,0.9757,0.106,0.0199,2.0409,5.6573,2.9471,0.5871,0.0049,4.0455,2.6629,5.6897,0.3529,0.4658,0.7387,4.8456,4.529,1.4911,3.4364,2.4289,0.4336,3.8333,3.5644,4.444,6.3892,0.4141,0.6519,1.5407,5.4459,1.7639,2.906,4.9561,2.3653,0.9566,2.2284,2.821,6.7692,1.6964,3.9015,6.9589,4.2905,0.2216,2.0341,2.6617,1.2343,4.4987,4.086,1.4765,3.3172,5.8759,0.9024,2.1989,5.241,1.1259,1.5186,3.4281,0.0083,4.1017,1.384,1.8878,4.8247,0.0273,0.5718,0.209,0.4164,0.0002,4.0879,1.0718,0.2173,0.2159,2.4914,2.6056,4.3282,3.97,2.6594,3.2614,0.2303,1.6615,0.0211,0.4199,0.2447,0.0001,5.5471,5.3536,0.1433,1.1377,0.0184,0.0034,0.8922,0.4599,1.1273,1.2356,1.4268,2.5606,3.4504,4.2099,3.932,2.0297,2.3351,4.8484,0.5158,0.3381,1.8319,0.3058,2.6942,3.176,3.1987,5.5337,1.134,1.345,0.4381,5.0624,3.2954,0.3462,0.964,2.4871,2.389,4.0958,1.1186,0.0002,2.7373,3.0416,2.0052,0.042,0.3828,0.0023,3.9537,0.551,0.2032,0.0001,1.261,0.3236,3.9574,4.4219,1.7595,0.1694,1.502,0.5667,6.2176,1.6602,5.4655,1.9739,0.9577,2.9399,0.8328,3.1508,1.6344,3.5908,6.297,3.5421,0.5859,1.1623,0.0002,1.8726,2.642,3.1435,1.3487,0.0193,8.5449,1.2614,0.4249,3.8778,0.1935,0.1248,0.0001,2.8676,0.2299,1.4298,0.051,1.0624,4.0323,1.7772,0.2626,1.0927,1.1558,0.0002,4.6094,0.0662,1.816,0.0746,0.1895,3.9405,1.42,3.9187,0.474,0.4236,2.0385,1.9369,4.1449,6.4641,2.8396,1.3984,0.0675,0.0826,1.4787,4.3081,1.3371,1.7618,4.7389,3.1492,0.2178,2.8045,0.1864,2.2676,3.8104,0.109,0.754,2.4786,4.6548,0.9301,1.1289,0.2749,0.0239,0.0936,1.1324,4.4152,1.6825,0.6204,1.0435,0.1853,4.0903,1.19,3.7955,2.7717,1.1193,5.7703,0.3574,1.327,2.7609,2.043,1.5723,4.3303,3.5738,0.9861,6.5086,1.4758,0.1817,6.8802,4.61,1.8212,2.3673,2.1709,1.5525,1.0926,3.4484,2.4029,0.3414,1.7101,0.5699,3.1423,0.896,0.4713,3.9142,1.5001,2.116,1.703,0.4882,0.2472,0.0002,3.4598,1.4677,2.8452,0.5369,0.012,0.2481,0.0033,1.685,0.7201,1.1221,0.1218,0.09,0.0001,4.3295,2.3067,0.0242,0.097,4.252,3.9842,1.1106,0.9335,0.3029,0.7441,1.1234,1.7965,2.2438,1.3476,5.1065,1.4144,4.189,2.9949,4.2619,0.0708,0.3191,1.5222,3.8407,0.7957,3.4147,0.9797,1.073,2.772,1.3654,1.798,3.7026,3.3067,1.5913,1.1179,3.4475,1.8553,0.9131,1.6348,0.8721,3.6016,4.3517,5.0063,1.2207,3.6104,0.0325,1.5944,3.566,0.235,0.1061,1.0116,3.6464,4.3219,1.0795,5.7072,2.0036,0.4259,0.0002,1.7074,2.7168,4.7762,0.0148,1.8438,2.0092,1.996,0.7654,0.0146,8.323,0.0131,5.3242,6.6788,3.2335,1.694,1.6206,1.4562,0.0711,0.102,0.0001,4.3293,4.4113,1.4117,1.84,1.9945,1.1326,4.356,0.7715,1.542,3.7436,4.4091,1.3072,2.8462,0.4056,0.1753,5.5751,2.2688,4.6281,2.181,0.6336,2.337,2.1408,1.9457,1.2585,0.6922,6.9366,0.6868,0.8332,1.26,1.4387,0.0189,0.507,0.0061,0.8744,5.2335,0.2292,0.7556,1.9808,0.6768,1.4391,0.3884,3.3014,1.3237,2.9417,0.7646,0.3606,0.0067,4.3336,1.9301,6.963,3.0761,1.3162,0.9878,3.0253,1.6722,5.7601,1.2997,3.3844,3.3903,0.314,3.0497,0.6374,0.0297,0.2953,0.0041,1.4572,2.9303,1.2992,5.0455,1.2687,3.8601,3.0426,1.5134,3.2454,0.7263,0.7904,0.6726,0.0002,3.8007,2.8701,2.641,0.6841,5.084,3.3772,5.1544,1.7966,1.3179,1.8215,6.4978,1.5694,0.6022,1.0323,0.0001,1.837,3.6712,2.0502,1.7467,1.9707,1.6982,0.0094,0.3506,1.8968,0.176,0.7378,4.9806,2.9153,1.7648,7.6193,0.9059,0.0273,2.5315,0.0165,0.5534,2.1309,1.0559,1.6614,0.0107,0.0905,4.0919,2.8532,2.5235,4.6202,0.3609,6.6628,0.15,4.4952,2.3109,4.0849,0.541,0.4266,0.554,3.6973,2.7597,5.0783,1.3597,0.3741,0.1679,0.0002,1.1503,2.6019,0.002,3.053,2.2489,4.5092,3.3344,2.0915,1.6935,4.7327,5.0903,1.8831,0.2715,0.7121,5.7788,2.3267,1.8779,0.0006,0.7747,1.4727,2.7126,0.5172,1.5913,2.6863,5.6905,2.3326,1.0749,0.0081,3.118,3.4296,0.0032,0.4842,1.4946,1.9704,3.5209,1.7823,1.7288,2.9082,2.6865,0.0341,2.126,2.4885,1.7802,5.7066,0.7603,3.516,1.8062,5.2095,3.1297,0.9195,0.5896,5.7043,0.3217,2.3078,0.9965,0.7207,0.5463,0.7861,0.0262,0.2829,4.4863,1.7014,1.713,0.4263,0.0657,0.0058,4.9118,0.8396,0.1951,1.9587,1.4324,1.4686,2.5426,4.3115,0.3225,0.4934,0.3858,0.0481,0.0132,0.4779,0.1835,0.6597]}

{"id":2401,"ended":false,"length":526,"gen_text":"You are a parent in an anime. Your child is born with epic anime hair, and you are certain they will become the protagonist. You are determined to not become a tragic back story like so many other anime parents. You are going to create your own way to live your anime child's life!\n\nThe following post was posted on the Niconico Douga Nico Live Journal. It's a discussion about a character named Kotori Kosaka from 'Yurikuma Arashi.' In the discussion, fans say the following.\n\nIt is a very good anime and I hope you continue to work on it, and that it'll do well, so please continue to update it (for people who can't wait). I think that there were a lot of good updates. If there's one manga that deserves a spinoff or a sequel, it's this one, and I can't wait for it.\n\nOne person writes that her own son likes the anime, and the parents want it to continue. Another said they think everyone loves Shokugeki no Soma, so they have seen so many of the other anime.\n\nThey all talked about how Shokugeki no Soma will become a new trend and that they like the anime.\n\nWe hope that Shokugeki no Soma will get more popularity through the various ways, like this anime will (the parents are asking so hopefully it will), and we think that we will make the best of Shokugeki no Soma, so the same should go for this anime too, and that the series will become more important. The fans will enjoy it regardless of which genre is used.\n\nComments from the Niconico Live Journal post below:\n\n\u306c\u305c\u3045\u3058\u3093~!!\n\nWOW!! Thank U!!

{"id":3794,"ended":false,"length":620,"gen_text":"The villain defeats the hero but the world turns out to be a better place because of his twisted views.\n\n. The protagonist in the comic Shimmer and Shine goes to an alternate universe for his healing treatments and ends up getting a job there and befriending a new girl that's really cute.\n\nThis could also be an inverted trope. In most fantasy stories, you have the villain coming and killing the good guys. The good guys have been fighting back for ages and are at the point of desperation. So the hero saves the day and defeats the villain. On the other hand, in some stories the bad guy defeats the heroes on purpose for some reason or to try to see how strong the hero will be against any challenge or to see how much pain he'll put the hero through to try to learn something. One of the more memorable examples are the heroes\/villains in The Dark Tower series, where the villains always win, and there's always a reason why the villain has conquered everyone, so it's very much a case of \"They tried, they failed\". This also applies to the other side of this trope, where the real heroes are too weak to fight back, although they are very competent at fighting against the other side's magic.\n\nInverted with the hero (and the occasional villain) in the fantasy\/adventure video game series, The Witcher, where the heroes defeat the villain, usually because they prove the villain is overconfident and is really a good guy as they had always thought. The villains will often be this to the hero at least, and the heroes will even accept that it's because the hero is too noble to go against his friends.\n\nIn Lord of the Rings, both Sauron and his servants, the Balrog, are defeated in the end when the One Ring is destroyed, either by the final destruction of Sauron himself or by the hero breaking the ring. Conversely, the protagonists of each book often seem to be the ones with the most strength and intelligence, though by no means will they be able to defeat any foe alone, or even after the final destruction of Sauron.\n\nThe protagonist in My Life with Master will do anything to prevent his mistress from going back to the evil sorcerer. He can even turn against his mistress in one chapter and give her a new life and try to win her over, but in the end, he can only do so much to restore her relationship with her former master.\n\nTabletop Games\n\nWeb Original\n\nIn Creepypasta, this is the premise of the \"Sisterhood of the Lost\" story arc and the \"Red Comet Story\" arc.\n\nA common theme in Tales from the Crypt. After spending hours in a dungeon, the protagonist will inevitably be forced to battle and kill one of the monsters they came to rescue. The trope title is a pun on the \"LOST\" episode \"The Man in Black\". This often involves the protagonist in the midst of a Heroic End and a more direct example (the \"LOST\" version of the trope) where the hero is forced to commit Suicide as his life is in danger.\n\nThis is also one of the major plot points of \"The Evil Eye.\"\n\nWestern Animation","token_len":661,"entropy":[9.9406,9.2715,1.3042,1.3233,4.3559,2.0312,6.4194,5.4331,2.285,0.5665,0.104,1.4002,1.0617,0.0316,1.7489,0.6637,2.6642,11.2103,6.2748,0.5546,1.2408,0.0114,7.3636,2.5662,4.7669,5.8061,1.7959,3.8047,9.0078,4.7179,1.1395,0.1305,4.8396,1.7348,3.0952,2.4577,1.0619,4.5723,2.8016,4.91,5.3928,1.5497,2.1762,0.0115,3.333,2.0957,1.8953,2.6295,2.6335,5.5148,0.0083,0.9632,4.1776,2.7068,4.4,3.6447,4.6029,3.3013,0.5098,1.4446,0.0001,5.0303,5.0041,2.1417,0.4459,3.3952,4.3987,3.2806,1.5574,1.9813,4.2345,5.055,1.1197,0.3653,5.1887,2.7638,1.3017,5.0599,5.0339,3.8501,3.271,0.8241,3.0588,0.6637,1.4754,2.5963,1.7883,0.1347,3.046,3.6113,3.5838,3.1272,1.6971,2.5497,1.2007,2.6377,5.4018,0.8645,0.8339,0.6117,4.5244,0.7976,3.4507,1.2833,1.2714,4.0398,0.6172,0.0353,1.365,3.725,0.0764,0.5074,0.6966,5.4171,0.2667,0.7811,0.0413,0.0577,1.3376,2.2012,1.5521,1.5218,3.3107,0.7621,2.9678,0.0563,3.4385,5.1016,1.3789,4.3818,1.5593,0.7732,2.356,3.7236,4.8776,1.071,4.9787,1.3097,2.5809,0.9339,1.1174,3.5193,0.3289,4.8976,6.2091,3.0766,4.2151,1.5679,1.6113,0.7721,1.6927,3.8183,0.942,2.5004,2.4486,1.3718,0.4475,0.0168,2.2129,3.2884,0.3957,3.7525,1.4197,0.8475,6.004,1.5287,0.1917,2.9747,4.1338,0.6447,5.451,0.5403,4.0752,5.5363,1.2109,0.0639,0.7741,2.344,3.4505,0.5599,0.3971,1.5687,1.6198,0.8176,3.1198,3.1565,1.4728,2.2546,1.9291,4.1386,0.8907,1.4612,0.759,1.6914,1.1305,2.5337,2.8629,2.959,6.0446,4.932,2.9115,3.9329,2.0299,0.4745,4.4998,2.4281,0.8823,2.269,0.0459,1.6151,5.4921,4.9172,1.8656,1.0601,0.7517,2.472,3.4821,3.2281,1.3999,0.2576,1.6068,4.8228,1.1701,0.269,2.4503,0.6856,0.9185,0.6017,0.32,7.185,1.5464,1.9369,4.9587,1.1774,0.4837,2.3651,0.5479,1.8588,5.7115,2.0923,2.7596,3.8972,4.919,1.7651,2.4122,3.9823,0.5111,3.4966,0.2065,2.6917,5.3437,0.8231,0.7625,0.0002,2.0966,1.9381,1.9344,1.2151,3.8283,5.3351,1.9484,2.5678,5.9696,1.0111,0.2447,1.4486,1.6401,4.7225,2.9994,3.3212,0.0104,5.079,0.4214,0.8899,2.3576,2.5169,2.7541,1.8349,1.1638,0.6932,2.1832,3.8126,0.4235,1.9269,2.0039,3.6498,2.9052,1.0845,6.4056,3.3077,1.6951,2.3035,5.8596,0.6024,0.0017,1.0396,3.7778,4.1241,2.609,3.4117,0.3248,5.8233,2.6021,3.7941,3.9611,1.694,0.4553,2.4025,2.1193,4.177,1.8433,2.166,5.2052,3.1904,0.5882,1.3914,3.6312,3.506,3.0279,2.1962,1.7272,1.1163,1.026,4.7976,5.2348,2.4581,3.5592,0.717,3.8973,0.9631,1.6927,0.8358,1.9437,6.169,1.24,4.1722,1.6354,2.4276,3.2836,1.0258,0.8175,0.0002,1.8241,6.4626,0.0369,0.0272,0.0144,0.488,4.4385,2.5853,0.0017,0.0967,2.7323,3.1374,2.865,0.3672,2.0249,0.0003,1.9671,1.0781,0.8677,2.5729,0.5164,0.719,3.5633,0.8875,3.226,0.0196,0.3832,0.3677,1.8645,4.8558,0.3481,0.6311,6.2587,3.6476,0.0206,2.3017,0.0003,1.6714,0.6924,0.7736,0.7345,3.8143,4.2459,0.4046,0.9111,1.2073,6.1804,0.0374,1.1645,4.8576,1.214,5.1276,1.6645,4.6107,3.8899,0.248,1.4733,1.4637,1.5241,4.3335,0.2373,1.6516,4.7877,1.0739,4.6734,1.1356,4.4491,5.9698,3.0697,0.0121,4.6557,0.5109,1.3514,1.3804,0.0081,0.6063,3.9069,3.2331,3.824,2.2138,2.9456,0.7809,5.1742,2.3643,4.6234,5.4053,0.0539,1.5698,0.0006,0.5666,0.8935,0.0002,1.9832,4.2098,1.4164,6.2396,3.6971,2.076,0.0267,3.288,4.7605,1.3804,0.3739,3.9821,1.6221,5.2597,0.3037,3.4136,2.5334,0.1589,1.391,2.9097,3.2594,1.5728,2.565,4.3878,1.5343,4.5072,1.9243,0.6849,3.2865,2.963,4.2904,1.6692,2.0643,4.9621,0.8263,0.9784,4.6407,1.903,4.0557,4.1468,0.0938,3.4238,0.3113,2.4349,2.1916,1.0839,3.0727,0.1778,0.2224,1.4288,0.8553,3.1431,4.023,1.6494,0.7027,0.0636,1.5284,5.8616,0.9877,5.9957,0.1622,1.0205,2.8208,1.3897,0.3938,0.4362,0.0001,5.5628,0.0022,0.0295,0.025,0.0002,4.5888,2.294,0.1437,0.0003,1.7764,6.3344,0.1741,0.0077,1.3904,2.4564,0.5733,1.0745,4.7969,0.2746,0.8383,2.578,4.501,3.4065,2.0381,0.2892,0.4465,5.7179,0.5494,2.3258,1.1991,4.6226,1.0098,2.4729,5.1945,5.6551,6.1179,0.8463,0.2288,0.4357,0.9277,0.0002,4.1462,2.8728,2.6977,0.351,5.6259,0.7819,0.252,2.1468,1.2601,4.9813,6.341,4.1617,2.72,1.1757,2.1894,1.0402,0.669,1.7944,2.0326,3.9374,1.7673,3.254,0.1157,3.4009,3.562,1.4964,3.7518,0.3315,0.3083,1.9587,2.7077,3.2678,0.3489,2.4401,0.443,2.1495,4.0399,4.8764,1.2528,2.5621,2.6349,0.3842,0.8969,2.8051,4.9672,2.628,0.1313,3.3431,1.4314,0.6264,1.379,0.5068,0.4038,0.8266,4.5637,4.6893,3.9042,1.0883,1.0172,4.6435,2.6606,3.9975,0.0027,0.706,2.2909,8.648,3.068,2.6986,5.8667,5.7634,2.9997,5.3084,3.0567,2.8841,2.7354,0.1344,0.1018,3.4809,1.9445,1.1167,0.2852,0.2796,3.0996,0.4033,1.8602,1.6004,2.1448,0.1597,5.2929,2.8937,4.7047,3.692,3.4363,0.5342,1.2795,0.3133,0.5582,0.6488,0.0002,4.135,0.695,3.2746,3.7012,0.066,0.0572,2.849,2.1014,1.0954,0.6255,3.9925,1.3685,5.4029,4.6422,3.859,1.2,0.0002,0.6602,0.0008]}
{"id":46,"ended":true,"length":604,"gen_text":"You accidentally uncover a vast, dangerous, government conspiracy that only exists to cover up something petty and absurd... and one that only the true believers could possibly understand. The Conspiracy\n\nThe Conspiracy is a plot point in the first act of Half-Life 2, and a secondary plot device in its sequel, Half-Life 2: Episode One. The conspiracy was first mentioned in the original Half-Life, during a conversation between Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance. It is mentioned multiple times after that, but is never fully explained. The origins of the conspiracy are speculated to be related with the Combine's creation of the black boxes from space.\n\nContents show]\n\nOverview\n\nTheories\n\nAccording to one of Gordon Freeman's notes found in the Borealis during the events of Half-Life 2, Half-Life's universe is structured into eight parallel universes called \"Universes\". These Universes are connected, and there are many reasons why Portal has taken place in one of these Universes.\n\nAs seen in Eli Vance's journal, in any given Portal universe, the Combine's space stations have already set up a number of stations similar to the ones that are present in Earth's universe (which the Half-Life 2 characters call \"The Hub\"), though the way in which the conduits are arranged is different. This implies that the Universe in the game takes place on Earth.\n\nWhile several universes could be logically possible in this world, due to portals being present throughout Earth, it seems that the Combine are the main creators\/builders of portals and spacelanes. It also suggests that if the Portal device went through a portal in the right location on our universe, it would return back to that location at the beginning of the Portal in their universe instead of Earth.\n\nThe Conspiracy may be the explanation to why the Portal's mechanism will function differently in each part of the Universe (Earth included).\n\nSeveral theories exist regarding the existence of the conspiracy, the most probable being that some unknown Combine entity has created these portals, and have used them to control various parts of the human race. This has been the case with many of the Combine's actions in the games. The Portal's mechanism, known as the Chronal Accelerator, is a mechanism that has the power to transfer the timeline from one form into another. Thus, if the timeline in one part of the universe is manipulated through this kind of mechanism, it may not be possible for the timeline, in another location, to be affected in a similar fashion. Thus, the Conspiracy may have been present throughout the time travel that occurred after the Half-Life 2 universe was created.\n\nThe Conspiracy may also be a reference to Nikola Tesla's Tesla coil, or the Portal device that powers it.\n\nTrivia\n\nIn the \"Ending: Ending A-01\" trailer for Half-Life 2, Eli Vance's notes mention a Portal found in a planet in our Universe.\n\nReferences\n\nThere exists a Portal device that can \"send\" people across time as well as time and space, which is a reference to the Portal device. Gordon Freeman uses this device to travel from planet to planet, bringing humanity to new places and discovering mysteries that the Combine are keeping quiet.","token_len":661,"entropy":[10.89,10.2486,0.9085,5.9764,2.7653,4.4792,2.538,7.9151,1.1699,1.9262,5.2216,5.8064,3.2792,4.5222,0.2188,4.6396,11.8757,1.4285,5.7253,4.2712,2.4864,5.7084,1.5777,4.1465,2.2666,4.9354,2.9064,3.597,1.6624,1.2536,0.5261,3.1382,5.6474,5.553,0.0102,2.1981,2.9729,1.0189,0.497,5.7569,2.6752,0.1721,1.1921,2.7767,4.6709,0.1845,4.7675,0.0302,0.0075,0.325,1.8599,1.4213,2.1914,3.474,0.3214,3.6133,0.2889,3.676,1.0145,0.9828,0.3929,0.0028,0.0004,0.3372,0.0215,0.0108,0.3838,0.0842,1.8263,2.5,2.7312,2.1227,1.4592,0.6515,0.814,2.6538,0.8086,0.0024,0.0011,1.4268,4.3971,1.8895,1.0952,0.458,0.6617,0.065,0.06,0.8411,0.0001,0.0016,0.8159,2.4129,1.0491,3.5524,4.8084,0.0091,3.869,1.3612,0.6221,2.1787,1.7918,0.774,1.818,0.585,0.4645,2.0202,5.6902,0.0801,0.0934,0.1591,0.4455,5.6732,0.3138,0.2129,2.9452,5.2465,0.3159,2.2352,1.4556,3.364,0.2546,0.553,4.7108,1.9572,3.3303,6.1468,1.8267,0.564,0.0002,0.4687,0.0073,0.0003,0.0019,0.0002,0.16,0.0449,0.0002,0.9746,4.9531,0.4156,0.0002,3.4762,0.0022,3.6881,1.4971,2.0471,0.5243,0.0274,2.5668,2.3225,0.3723,0.6669,3.795,0.0001,3.9648,0.5006,2.2804,0.0329,0.2627,0.0038,0.001,0.6033,0.3883,7.0105,0.0049,0.0008,2.9214,2.8051,0.7985,5.5605,1.8611,3.8256,3.208,1.4227,3.9862,1.1047,3.8906,0.1157,0.0014,1.2298,2.6686,0.8142,0.0001,0.6063,2.2332,3.4748,1.3755,4.9008,0.6536,2.6239,5.5953,0.4787,6.4075,4.3055,4.4742,0.0536,0.1702,1.4602,0.5497,0.7777,0.334,0.0,1.4586,1.4537,0.0002,4.7981,2.3314,0.229,6.4026,0.0135,0.0306,2.2818,0.4722,3.6967,6.5048,0.5803,2.5111,2.3569,0.3655,1.2815,0.9656,3.5929,5.5758,2.5444,2.8227,4.828,5.5078,0.2269,1.5103,3.2031,0.0042,3.9413,5.5851,0.0638,0.665,1.4153,2.7027,2.5646,2.2447,0.2948,2.5873,0.3875,2.3054,3.0465,3.8494,3.8516,4.7946,0.0029,0.002,1.3307,5.5111,2.0089,0.4581,2.7299,2.3104,2.1004,3.883,1.5782,6.0491,1.7224,0.0042,1.1623,6.7571,0.0001,1.5334,3.0651,1.5364,0.735,0.4631,3.1578,2.3252,0.0833,0.765,6.3138,1.6821,4.3954,2.2974,2.1934,0.008,2.8603,1.0756,3.1334,0.7602,0.0002,4.6383,5.6208,2.9182,4.6588,1.3319,4.8293,2.0861,3.456,2.7996,4.0704,0.3015,5.1054,0.0101,5.4877,1.3942,3.0093,2.705,3.86,1.4657,1.3094,2.5369,1.2407,0.8781,2.0235,2.9075,2.4773,3.2242,2.7308,6.3099,2.5082,0.2203,1.9059,2.3378,6.2143,2.1386,0.7502,1.0446,2.4968,2.6988,2.7528,0.1033,5.1075,0.8001,2.2219,4.3084,6.5109,1.7296,1.4253,1.2445,1.5318,1.7855,4.4124,2.2534,4.0488,6.3047,3.0295,0.2543,0.5964,0.8637,5.2529,3.1093,0.2407,3.0241,1.8342,4.5062,0.7406,4.4393,0.0896,0.5943,3.0493,2.8251,3.5732,0.5173,4.6759,0.087,4.1044,0.4213,0.9368,0.0002,1.66,4.3131,4.3337,0.892,1.9144,4.5204,3.4056,0.8845,0.7301,2.1348,5.1407,5.3839,4.6733,5.0362,1.3041,0.5103,0.9602,7.0349,0.0172,0.2334,1.9687,3.1462,1.5496,4.4505,0.7416,1.5146,0.0002,5.8131,0.6074,1.8617,1.8786,0.245,3.4839,0.0549,0.3605,0.8944,1.564,2.8165,0.6827,5.1237,1.1262,0.4661,5.0832,3.8072,3.4801,1.7378,2.3526,2.464,3.1638,0.8127,1.8918,1.1429,3.946,2.7615,0.3695,0.3669,3.3082,4.7583,3.382,0.0086,0.3983,3.9671,0.3559,0.7817,2.4535,4.2906,1.3212,3.3942,2.1028,1.6208,3.3285,1.8184,0.1142,1.1586,0.5035,2.6351,1.8241,0.3205,2.916,1.3807,2.2467,2.7236,2.6326,1.9659,2.6242,5.5569,0.0922,0.5639,6.2386,2.6156,0.2577,0.0083,0.1181,1.3009,2.1524,4.8739,1.0533,3.4088,2.0902,2.1648,0.0406,4.6634,2.1037,2.5521,2.7804,0.1783,7.3014,2.765,0.0764,0.6661,4.5216,0.1872,1.902,0.5475,3.4567,1.6809,1.8451,2.7617,0.0805,0.1065,0.8653,0.7263,3.1543,3.6976,3.1048,7.6558,0.0019,0.9581,0.151,0.9195,2.5076,3.9954,0.8839,1.2021,1.2243,0.7218,1.0667,6.8506,1.5786,2.4386,5.6846,0.2851,0.0495,0.3444,1.8074,2.8227,1.7643,0.2712,2.2797,0.1846,3.7685,0.1475,0.8918,2.2713,0.9786,3.0335,1.0539,6.6628,3.3161,0.4913,4.3515,2.0975,4.1065,1.399,5.0914,0.452,4.5395,0.0062,0.0014,0.2536,3.2695,1.2562,0.5391,0.6454,0.4897,0.0002,1.7241,1.3856,1.6521,0.6314,0.6921,1.9761,2.4226,0.0171,6.4547,0.0001,0.8692,4.3919,1.7478,0.6912,3.8335,1.5834,5.9804,1.3323,3.5872,4.537,0.6666,0.3755,1.083,0.0002,3.8592,0.1232,0.0002,2.212,0.807,4.7052,5.3652,2.8011,4.4985,4.4997,1.513,4.532,3.1448,0.5083,2.6906,1.7806,0.4417,0.0053,0.0015,0.0469,1.0673,3.4326,0.2474,3.4128,2.8258,2.2554,2.3475,5.2006,4.3495,0.5843,1.4391,4.3713,2.3845,4.4608,1.6478,0.7892,1.7423,0.0002,4.3851,0.7625,0.0001,4.6465,5.3926,0.6403,4.2459,1.9636,1.5114,1.8451,4.5248,4.02,1.5175,1.6344,4.084,1.6973,5.4447,1.3197,0.1545,6.3928,2.6138,0.1491,1.7831,2.434,1.2276,3.484,0.8939,0.0142,0.5669,0.4073,0.3204,1.6496,6.7441,0.2712,3.0974,0.9824,0.3359,0.662,1.2629,2.5956,5.4243,0.1627,0.0301,1.6402,5.159,5.0403,1.1733,2.148,2.2337,1.6165,2.2638,4.9362,2.3207,2.4793,0.4029,3.5486,2.2639,4.7835,0.5898]}
{"id":2854,"ended":true,"length":632,"gen_text":"At age 20 in your tribe you're tasked with venturing out into the woods for a bonfire. People join you over the course of this trip, they're you from different worlds leading very different lives. You 'll come home in the night to find your clan having the same conversation you had in the forest with them.' But the real kicker is the way 'the game' really begins - a journey through the woods with your clan that is as personal and intimate as you're ever sure you've ever had.\n\nThese are the main reasons I still watch shows like Lost and The Walking Dead. They make me feel like I have a personal connection with the characters, with who they are and how their world is constructed. They're stories where we feel deeply about a world, the way things work, our ability to perceive the world. As a storyteller, I'm drawn to them, even if some of the mechanics feel a little artificial and I really hope some of the creators are thinking about these issues. It's not that there's anything wrong with telling stories about humanity, about surviving in the outside world. It's good to explore the human condition.\n\nBut when a show's not mindful about telling those real stories, when the mechanics aren't mindful of how you can connect to a living, breathing world, those mechanics often feel lifeless. The Walking Dead (and the rest of these 'couplings') sometimes feel forced, just because it's not trying hard enough to be something more than a game of hide and seek. At least with Lost, that's always clear in the game design that it's working with. But for whatever reason, most interactive fiction lacks that same clarity; it's hard to tell what a world exists for other than 'escape' and 'play.'\n\nBut with that in mind, a little more thinking about the mechanics isn't necessarily a bad thing. The Walking Dead: Season Two doesn't feel like it cares about how you connect with the characters (outside of a shallow love triangle). Instead, it feels entirely focused on 'playing' the characters, and it's good for the game. I think it's a game, it's good for me to have fun with the characters, and it's good for a story to do what narrative does best: connect with you, not be some generic escapist escapism.\n\nI'll certainly give The Walking Dead: Season Two all the credit in the world for trying to make its players feel connected with these characters over the course of this season. But it's hard, and it's hard to keep doing it for this long without veering into the realm of forced, empty storytelling. So that's good, and I applaud that, but it shouldn't have to be like that.\n\nWe should all care about how we can create memorable characters that exist outside of a show, and create compelling characters that people care about. A good story can't do this, and the best stories are those that allow you to connect with a living, breathing world.\n\nBut we shouldn't have to, if we want to get away from forced-but-insincere gaming. Let's build a world in our minds and tell stories with it instead of games.","token_len":662,"entropy":[6.4462,3.5937,5.0884,8.7823,9.0172,2.4405,4.0146,7.8225,0.1619,8.5571,0.0091,1.2226,0.8689,0.133,3.9239,3.4084,1.2891,9.2134,0.005,0.9189,7.8277,7.4493,0.6247,7.318,0.613,0.6952,0.0046,4.8391,4.4792,0.9973,5.7774,3.259,5.707,7.6846,3.538,5.9141,9.9022,3.0573,0.1651,0.1773,0.5523,2.0138,9.9617,3.8419,4.1356,4.657,3.9369,1.6548,1.8349,1.7674,1.2886,1.4678,5.0213,3.618,4.3315,1.9035,1.403,1.6918,1.5637,2.4296,0.2768,2.4486,3.9429,2.6278,6.86,4.6122,2.5715,3.8058,3.0096,0.6518,2.4515,3.7647,7.2955,2.7592,3.3687,0.2302,5.6286,3.2677,4.6553,3.3572,5.1508,1.8746,0.7217,1.6363,2.8544,1.9406,2.1233,4.2144,2.7021,3.6104,4.7371,1.5901,2.7176,0.0388,1.9782,3.6354,1.27,5.9708,3.0315,2.8108,0.9387,1.6503,1.2346,1.161,0.0192,5.4118,1.2652,1.0972,5.3842,2.5349,1.6696,5.8,6.1381,5.2263,0.6021,2.3294,1.3221,1.4882,1.2419,0.0004,0.7033,1.621,4.0923,0.5409,0.4932,0.9392,0.3308,3.6904,0.7531,3.0254,0.5385,1.5272,1.0117,0.3379,1.4002,3.159,5.5094,0.1226,0.219,0.9519,2.1885,2.829,2.7495,1.594,3.4588,0.2479,2.1706,1.9039,3.2784,3.5914,2.9526,3.0282,5.6768,3.3092,4.1035,1.7866,1.7022,3.6031,2.7686,4.7493,1.8973,0.8407,4.1956,5.2001,0.0244,4.5449,1.5768,0.2266,2.6628,5.4592,1.3689,3.5484,0.0891,0.0017,0.7146,1.0096,2.36,3.2983,0.0571,2.8418,2.038,3.9435,1.0248,5.3195,0.3933,0.6878,5.3573,4.0107,1.3641,0.4901,4.6285,2.4204,3.9447,5.818,3.5522,4.357,0.4914,0.7679,3.7476,2.7342,3.2977,0.3539,2.6673,1.837,0.9966,3.7078,0.4715,2.2129,2.4223,4.0372,0.8349,0.6914,0.1509,0.0281,5.7417,0.8902,2.1639,5.5041,1.0702,5.0876,5.7394,1.3414,1.1035,5.9095,0.0235,1.2246,1.5214,0.0964,7.3541,0.8511,3.0468,1.9856,2.6009,0.2727,1.2685,1.5081,0.0002,1.1336,2.9699,2.696,1.8042,3.564,4.2872,5.4703,2.1565,4.3931,3.202,5.2504,0.2234,0.4282,1.9165,2.316,2.1981,2.9385,0.0003,3.5842,0.6987,2.8093,3.3451,2.3548,4.0095,1.1622,1.9844,5.3437,0.8647,0.0123,1.231,0.5404,4.9206,2.0633,4.2919,2.1188,5.0371,0.8433,2.8254,1.9062,0.0015,5.3085,1.0081,2.8305,3.3267,0.0538,3.8783,4.0855,4.4705,4.948,3.8867,0.4135,5.3925,1.491,6.3464,1.0784,4.9217,2.2906,2.0113,0.5976,2.5068,3.6498,2.0928,0.1314,0.3574,1.8029,3.1932,1.2486,1.2324,0.9472,2.9774,4.7862,3.1218,0.5088,0.0296,0.3961,5.695,1.8223,2.6336,1.1499,0.7359,4.3331,1.2126,3.615,5.4572,2.4854,0.6049,5.5401,4.3045,5.4458,3.3757,0.2995,5.0416,2.3515,0.7704,3.217,4.36,3.9462,0.0909,0.2907,4.6988,5.1831,1.7963,5.2304,0.7287,2.1444,1.4226,5.7897,1.6264,0.89,2.1881,0.1143,0.7466,1.7007,3.2929,3.5692,5.8042,1.0732,3.7279,0.1851,3.1784,4.6036,2.0285,1.6167,0.352,4.2213,1.1447,0.5756,0.0002,3.682,4.699,2.7776,1.8674,0.0022,0.1068,4.9773,3.994,2.2841,4.3956,1.0935,1.7407,1.6662,4.559,0.0003,2.4744,0.3958,0.0359,0.0435,0.162,3.028,1.1226,0.0029,4.3594,2.1585,1.0744,4.3265,0.0015,2.1295,0.7722,1.6661,4.8465,0.6292,3.0531,1.2345,2.549,1.6522,0.9206,1.009,4.8591,4.7415,0.0803,2.7365,6.2481,4.2021,0.6587,1.9136,3.8079,0.3393,0.4851,2.7083,7.115,1.3251,0.0246,3.3316,3.5662,0.5296,1.155,2.2998,1.3536,1.8948,2.6099,1.1205,5.2261,2.0808,2.1096,1.5842,1.3662,2.7352,2.5171,1.6457,0.5048,2.0192,3.8923,4.7973,3.7936,0.2687,4.1731,0.493,1.931,1.8551,2.7463,1.7329,1.0835,1.7974,0.45,0.8797,0.9964,1.4407,0.2027,0.4951,0.1094,4.5608,1.5451,0.5899,3.2447,3.1951,4.6091,1.7726,0.3508,1.1021,2.9224,1.3109,2.4986,2.4948,3.8755,5.7219,2.7151,5.1485,3.9437,0.3599,3.951,0.1064,0.0091,0.2911,0.6403,0.0002,2.3882,3.5437,5.515,4.3734,2.4116,0.0107,0.0023,0.4469,0.052,0.039,4.6462,0.2193,0.7976,0.436,0.0088,0.0052,0.3005,2.4831,0.8986,2.186,2.7874,3.5675,0.5457,2.0857,2.4215,2.0944,0.2968,6.2399,0.3665,0.0497,0.0034,2.295,1.2112,0.5644,1.2307,1.9475,0.7734,3.487,4.4925,2.0361,1.1082,0.5356,3.2712,0.4266,3.7628,3.3905,1.3349,3.3702,4.4146,0.1917,2.2817,5.2473,0.0002,0.6123,1.5973,2.0378,0.0087,3.0077,2.497,3.5381,2.6901,0.1348,4.0876,4.854,0.2152,5.4125,1.3431,2.0036,1.1101,3.7571,2.8687,2.7198,0.1599,1.5823,4.387,0.0003,3.763,0.5189,0.2304,3.8999,0.3049,0.2295,1.0229,0.0002,4.5469,2.9111,2.1082,2.9678,0.2455,1.6823,1.4229,2.7072,3.3506,4.2121,2.4469,2.9945,5.811,2.9778,0.2602,2.6785,5.6647,1.8695,1.9371,5.0154,2.8448,4.7625,0.6073,4.6946,1.7652,0.0418,0.9239,4.4142,2.2449,0.7869,2.3847,3.2087,3.2041,3.0904,2.0723,1.6503,3.0654,1.7718,1.4705,2.1149,1.9416,0.2085,3.9705,1.2559,0.0712,1.8387,0.4653,2.3668,0.9991,0.2395,0.0086,0.219,0.8963,1.487,0.0002,3.7216,3.2004,2.1261,0.0004,1.0143,0.0207,3.2611,3.5411,0.3898,0.7921,1.0828,3.9946,3.5396,0.2107,3.5948,5.4527,4.29,0.0038,4.5704,3.9372,0.0091,5.4316,1.3266,4.4484,0.2591,5.37,2.0544,1.381,3.7434,2.7908,1.8436,2.4225,3.5119,0.5694,2.4312,0.7903,3.3172,0.4972,3.4614,0.9122]}
{"id":3882,"ended":false,"length":614,"gen_text":"The Angelic Process\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, the Christian church was experiencing a resurgence because of the rise of the Renaissance. Christian ideals and practices were beginning to be openly discussed within medieval society. With the rise of new thinking, many philosophers began to study theology, or philosophy. During this era, the church also faced an increase in the number of people joining the church, and the growing interest in religion resulted in the new dogma, the Angelic Doctrine. On the other hand, the church also faced constant persecution; particularly because there were increasing groups who opposed Christendom with their opinions. This situation increased tension within the church, and many people were asking, \"What can we do?\"\n\nOne solution was found when the church realized that its doctrine was being ignored by some, and that some Christian groups were claiming that they were being persecuted. They created the Angelic Process to bring the gospel to everyone. They decided to spread the good news of salvation through a series of rituals and religious ceremonies. These ceremonies were then taught to the faithful who responded. These events were held at churches and were called Baptisms, where the believer would give thanks before being immersed in water which was then recited with the words Psalm 136.\n\nAfter their Baptism, the followers of Christ were given the chance to participate in several Christian celebrations and ceremonies over a two days. They could then live as they had always thought God intended them to live, and to receive His kingdom. It was believed that when the time came that they would have their \"second inheritance,\" that they could become servants of Christ, as they had already become his servants at the beginning. The church held their ceremonies to commemorate the events of Baptism, and to celebrate the end of the year. On Christmas Day, the time when many believe the birth of Jesus Christ was. The ceremonies were often accompanied by lighted candles which burned through the night, and the day before Christmas was called \"Candlemas,\" because of the way candles were set on Christmas night.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, they gave thanks and gave to the poor. The Church believed that as part of Christ's kingdom, He intended believers to offer their good works to God in charity. They would also pray for all of humanity, and ask God to grant gifts of peace and prosperity.\n\nChristians would also offer prayers for the dead. As it was believed that God would judge people on their works, God needed to know the best course. Christians were also believed to have the gift of prophecy so they could predict what God would choose. One of the ceremonies that they would always remember all year long, was when they would decorate the trees of Christmas with white and red ribbons. The ribbons represented the blood of the martyrs.

Let me know in the comments below.\n\nAuthor: Jake Anderson","token_len":664,"entropy":[6.0418,9.5415,7.3495,2.7441,0.2926,0.7557,5.5748,2.689,2.5889,1.7137,10.1721,3.3863,2.8967,10.1836,2.1336,1.7308,0.1766,4.8798,1.9973,8.1042,0.139,0.0079,0.0085,0.8455,0.9109,0.0084,7.3601,4.135,5.8724,3.5382,0.7783,4.8762,0.063,5.4702,0.2572,0.1754,2.1554,4.775,2.2718,2.1848,4.016,0.2083,1.9461,0.3214,0.4872,0.0001,0.2745,1.9827,1.2269,3.3037,0.0998,0.8884,3.6843,2.1536,2.9151,0.3165,3.3693,1.8271,0.1978,0.7352,1.8088,0.9123,1.4893,0.0752,1.5997,1.8104,0.2154,0.0953,0.0002,0.1834,3.9359,3.4708,2.7075,0.1552,1.2461,1.3293,3.1295,0.4155,2.6897,5.9308,6.1701,0.64,1.0812,3.4427,6.2271,2.7177,4.0512,4.3358,2.4792,0.8946,2.3877,1.3209,5.2157,0.2204,2.3433,0.0002,0.2871,1.8199,4.401,4.759,3.652,0.4777,1.46,2.7817,4.265,4.2201,1.8028,4.6223,0.1156,1.5024,0.0002,0.1727,1.7375,3.7808,0.9238,2.6457,0.5296,2.2194,3.6725,0.5147,0.421,2.7792,0.0001,0.2932,0.6205,2.9933,2.058,1.0653,3.0249,1.388,0.7933,4.6124,2.9358,3.9419,0.0475,0.0333,0.0028,0.1692,0.4398,0.0002,0.2185,0.4864,3.0432,0.5754,5.5046,0.1824,0.9073,4.0137,0.4562,1.8584,0.872,0.0002,0.1444,0.3595,2.2658,0.3929,0.712,1.6406,1.2377,4.144,1.5268,5.1397,2.4376,1.9027,0.2151,0.5389,0.3154,2.8347,0.4746,0.2978,1.8223,8.7649,0.4352,4.615,0.1057,0.0403,0.0002,0.1279,0.3702,4.7873,3.301,3.7726,2.3063,1.0912,3.5351,2.4045,4.6316,3.2288,5.2893,3.0727,0.8375,1.3244,0.8676,3.6096,0.3532,0.0993,0.0002,0.1422,0.2579,2.3417,0.4653,0.618,2.5748,0.5672,4.0773,6.0335,0.0615,0.0077,0.776,0.1949,3.6818,0.2803,1.9229,1.3976,2.9064,1.3545,1.7898,0.4041,3.896,3.4666,0.0334,2.4229,1.6364,4.7159,2.7079,6.2854,2.9073,3.29,0.3107,0.2664,0.1174,0.0002,0.1464,0.2601,5.6125,1.8764,1.1201,2.697,0.5485,2.165,5.9401,1.7926,5.7224,0.1219,0.7871,1.9308,0.0002,0.0643,2.8665,2.435,1.8844,4.4894,1.7757,0.1961,2.0169,1.2963,1.0219,2.27,1.7036,4.3135,1.0694,0.2791,0.2518,0.0002,0.0902,0.3543,3.0072,5.0952,0.5365,3.969,1.5618,1.5837,1.0861,4.3645,0.2228,4.7608,2.6404,2.3234,2.4001,0.4903,1.8472,4.4131,1.5185,1.0375,0.4985,2.0283,5.0315,3.5999,5.3636,0.1506,0.2152,0.0002,0.0726,3.5806,1.3878,2.8643,1.3943,3.625,3.4758,0.5157,0.136,3.4445,3.6029,1.144,1.4272,1.5064,0.3715,0.7965,3.1164,0.8266,0.3691,0.8246,2.4149,0.5314,0.0876,0.6373,1.2077,0.5089,0.9654,0.0739,0.5871,0.6675,0.1025,0.0381,0.0002,0.0697,6.1746,0.2318,3.7798,0.7623,2.3846,2.5209,3.4806,5.3752,0.1822,0.6263,1.0184,0.6132,0.6205,1.4829,0.0919,4.2019,0.7012,3.1928,0.5986,2.4286,0.0033,2.0007,0.0128,0.0957,0.0223,0.073,0.0611,0.0002,0.0684,0.4939,2.3633,0.4397,1.5629,0.237,2.0294,1.0874,2.1988,1.2841,0.5144,1.4901,0.0498,2.1213,0.1828,0.8752,0.057,4.1641,1.4955,0.2233,2.0654,5.352,0.1343,0.0378,0.0002,0.0534,5.8861,6.5043,0.2022,0.4005,1.1313,2.8067,1.8896,4.6771,0.0987,1.9751,1.2108,0.3788,2.9735,1.8759,3.3542,3.3865,0.5359,1.6193,0.5426,0.3592,0.0002,0.0669,2.4875,5.6936,0.0002,2.1171,0.1332,5.0914,2.5639,4.5042,5.7673,0.0342,0.0002,3.5602,2.3801,2.2718,2.2213,1.1713,2.1169,2.4311,2.0768,3.8332,0.2563,0.0313,0.175,0.0692,2.5717,1.0122,0.7149,0.3325,1.5999,3.2312,2.6492,2.237,0.8735,1.1109,5.4028,5.0045,5.45,0.4106,0.1687,0.0002,0.0651,0.5421,1.8206,0.3578,5.7871,1.9137,0.7026,1.6703,3.3067,0.4504,2.1031,0.0296,4.411,0.0252,0.2264,1.1836,0.0469,1.1205,0.2922,0.558,0.048,0.8505,0.3388,0.061,0.0326,0.0002,0.0469,5.6239,0.9392,0.166,3.6789,0.1275,1.6774,1.4451,0.5424,6.1598,0.0146,5.6032,2.4662,0.5493,1.0629,1.3672,0.1196,5.6551,0.4932,2.2304,4.3288,3.4846,2.8334,0.2299,0.9334,5.5225,0.0769,0.2969,3.2547,0.0063,0.0981,1.8035,2.0682,4.7585,3.4615,1.6797,1.0132,0.0337,6.7075,3.9221,0.9087,1.822,0.6075,1.0774,3.7763,4.1101,0.0452,0.0594,0.0002,0.0968,0.5176,1.9442,3.9773,1.6432,1.4037,2.0506,0.2293,0.7204,0.1366,4.0061,0.6404,3.3368,0.4387,0.0818,1.489,2.1313,0.2721,0.6414,1.9038,0.3163,0.2309,0.6898,0.0002,0.0611,0.4636,1.4571,0.1976,0.8827,0.0858,1.8254,4.5246,2.5054,2.4856,0.4389,1.5469,0.0244,0.4958,0.1532,0.1773,0.0153,1.1219,0.0973,0.0247,0.0325,0.0002,0.0482,2.4588,2.0629,6.0443,3.0888,2.453,1.1253,3.6443,2.8419,1.8272,2.5659,0.3553,3.7851,5.384,1.8673,0.7283,4.8472,1.9546,2.6542,0.1375,0.0887,0.0002,0.0873,0.4541,2.3131,0.3057,0.4628,4.411,1.935,3.238,2.6783,0.5675,2.5491,6.294,2.5009,0.0937,0.1684,0.0541,0.459,1.3537,2.9269,1.8105,0.4831,6.064,1.4956,0.0724,3.1386,1.8429,1.5142,0.0608,2.5433,0.1257,1.4853,2.6391,0.1496,1.8626,1.5112,0.2903,2.5594,0.8251,5.698,2.3837,0.7393,0.4245,0.0002,0.0549,7.9411,5.8419,3.2808,1.7058,0.6294,4.1716,2.2555,1.1683,1.8748,0.6671,5.5608,0.4581,2.1713,7.0349,1.5562,5.6221,0.8025,0.8552,1.2273,0.2735,3.1154,0.8822,0.0075,0.3536,0.0283,0.0311,0.9857,0.6457,0.7628,0.0002,4.6256,0.5866,5.6108,3.9321]}
{"id":4224,"ended":false,"length":607,"gen_text":": A new, lethal STD becomes a pandemic due to an unusual side-effect : It makes the infected really, really attractive to the person with it. \u00a0That's kind of the whole point of it; because people have to make up for any social problems they might have. \u00a0They have to compete, and as a competitive creature they have to show off their best qualities. This STD is pretty great for that. \u00a0This is why people are so crazy about this STD. \u00a0Here is a description of what actually happens to your body when you have this STD. It's important to note that this STD is NOT contagious; you can't get it from anyone else. \u00a0You get this STD, and then you don't. \u00a0When you do get the STD, it's a one time thing, and it won't come back (unless its a rare, really powerful version, otherwise it won't hurt anyone). As far as side-effects go here are the ones I've known : This STD causes the male reproductive organs to grow significantly larger, and make them appear like a giant erect penis. This STD causes some female reproductive organs to develop a tiny, non-viable embryo. This STD causes the skin of the legs to glow red. When this STD gets to the point where it has developed beyond the stage when it is visible to the naked eye, it gives off an amazing stench. \u00a0Even though there is no other thing in this world that can even remotely compare as bad, the stench that it gives off gets better and better. \u00a0This stench is so strong that it stinks up places, and if you are not careful, can kill you. \u00a0I heard that once, I must have passed a neighbor when I was very young, and he died when he could not get away, he took a deep breath and breathed this horrible stink that just killed him instantly. \u00a0Because of the stench, this STD is one of the only reasons you are going to die, if you have it. Note: \u00a0This means you will die of AIDS unless you take a VERY long time taking your medications. This STD makes its victims very horny. \u00a0They become uncontrollably aroused, and it's usually at this time they will try to copulate with anyone who comes by. \u00a0It's just a terrible, terrible turn-on. \u00a0And if they don't get aroused, they just die. \u00a0These deaths, although horrible, happened ALL THE TIME, people were dying from this STD. \u00a0But, luckily if it develops, that STD will never harm you, as far as we know. If the STD reaches the end stage wherein it can be sexually transmitted, it will turn the victim into a monster. \u00a0This STD causes the victims head to look like it is a giant weapon, and they will go ape-shit on anyone who attempts to mate with them. This STD causes the victims body to gain super strength, speed and agility, but becomes weaker in their hands. \u00a0As far as I know, there is no reason for it, aside from the fact that it is totally not related to the \"monster of the apocalypse\" meme.\nTyrannosaurus Rex","token_len":665,"entropy":[4.912,4.5203,4.7096,9.2676,8.039,7.5573,1.9786,3.5462,0.0006,6.0519,0.0099,2.6677,5.0022,8.6964,1.5797,0.0134,7.6729,4.8389,4.0732,1.8473,1.4196,7.2959,1.7937,0.0364,4.8723,0.4642,2.0999,5.3069,2.7443,1.0039,0.37,5.2782,0.0729,3.7166,1.0487,5.2563,0.0061,1.4069,1.5016,0.7273,0.6774,1.7225,4.5692,5.6662,3.9974,3.9454,2.4151,4.6129,4.0377,2.1077,4.1406,4.1352,3.8935,0.9883,1.3424,0.4005,2.0856,0.7371,0.0001,2.7936,1.1999,0.0502,5.4672,3.1713,1.1593,5.4987,1.0547,4.9644,2.3523,1.6621,1.6598,0.216,4.9197,0.5164,1.1124,2.4555,1.4666,1.0844,5.3507,3.6432,1.3765,4.9486,5.826,1.5692,2.6897,1.373,0.6654,0.0002,5.0352,1.4126,1.9115,2.9072,2.2158,1.334,4.446,0.1901,3.2115,1.2782,0.7822,0.3673,0.0001,5.8939,2.0667,0.7991,4.1236,0.3645,2.5716,6.7235,0.2912,1.915,3.4925,0.6408,0.9848,0.2514,1.1687,1.3411,0.4599,1.5824,3.7656,1.5684,4.7576,0.1461,0.7934,0.1746,1.2205,1.2328,0.9135,3.3958,1.7338,3.4747,1.8861,1.0573,0.5096,1.1629,0.4369,0.3595,2.7422,0.8684,0.5299,0.2444,0.0001,2.2423,3.5601,2.1751,0.487,3.2317,0.6999,1.0904,0.5168,2.9857,0.0006,1.6924,0.3504,0.0001,4.5328,0.3938,1.8598,0.6516,2.8465,0.3725,0.1591,1.0399,1.2967,3.0103,3.7844,2.2098,0.844,1.6776,0.4009,1.6475,3.8669,0.0005,1.1119,0.0316,4.2897,1.1142,6.4334,1.555,3.4213,1.7907,5.1613,4.0831,2.1493,2.8233,7.392,1.0143,3.2399,0.0004,6.1557,2.7414,0.7444,5.3099,2.6357,0.0059,4.6726,1.4199,0.01,0.2107,7.0864,0.6154,1.0854,1.7849,0.9753,1.3088,5.5073,6.3049,5.467,0.5572,2.3161,2.0719,4.6966,3.4862,1.0174,0.1664,2.0763,4.6689,0.3318,1.6401,1.4316,4.9388,1.2841,3.076,3.274,1.0755,2.8034,4.6008,0.1545,0.3832,2.5155,0.3059,0.4705,5.4904,4.7294,0.9071,0.0308,0.0417,3.1491,2.7622,4.6837,1.6406,5.0886,0.133,4.3561,0.4886,2.0237,1.3572,1.1272,0.0217,0.3849,0.6796,3.4458,1.3514,0.4945,5.5717,0.9052,6.0961,2.5868,1.2397,4.3903,1.6695,0.4514,3.6804,2.8991,1.0859,1.9113,0.5897,0.5911,2.4756,4.3154,5.0787,1.0572,2.0851,3.7369,0.3463,2.0835,2.075,1.2674,0.1903,0.1797,0.0053,0.2266,0.602,5.6493,0.4973,1.8643,4.7053,4.3037,0.0171,0.909,1.0578,0.0001,5.2872,2.1605,4.0198,0.6491,0.4171,3.7623,5.609,1.5367,3.3786,0.4147,0.3423,2.2364,5.0868,2.6348,0.4541,8.5612,2.321,2.3258,2.2635,0.7089,0.002,3.7317,2.7907,0.4466,0.0022,6.4296,5.0185,0.8359,0.1637,1.5001,0.555,0.0001,2.2741,1.7392,0.0052,0.8022,1.0405,1.8722,0.3434,0.9436,6.044,0.7784,0.9894,6.1581,3.9056,1.055,3.3832,0.5747,1.7208,2.8346,0.4619,0.7948,2.8642,2.8607,0.0941,0.3935,0.8651,0.0002,3.2217,5.0653,1.0538,3.7708,1.196,2.9293,5.9799,0.2117,4.6812,3.7961,5.4871,4.2534,0.2494,0.4976,3.3326,0.3138,1.069,0.8681,2.0881,2.23,4.0607,0.3531,5.1636,0.5014,1.3924,2.4442,3.6191,2.9841,6.3825,0.674,3.1556,0.2162,0.9027,2.2076,3.8252,2.1601,3.5299,3.5534,3.6659,1.7383,0.1141,2.5166,0.1267,0.746,0.0004,5.718,0.6476,1.9172,0.8656,0.0085,0.5097,2.5115,0.1134,0.7387,3.8878,0.1627,0.0766,2.5432,3.9141,2.9143,3.5347,5.0306,0.0213,2.9086,4.442,1.7828,0.2541,1.9545,0.9069,0.5981,6.7779,0.882,1.2098,0.0002,1.9113,5.3338,1.9988,1.8364,1.0694,2.9891,4.4169,5.3054,0.1778,3.0437,1.496,5.4916,2.0509,0.9221,6.3202,2.1279,3.3065,0.7801,3.1173,0.0607,2.3343,4.9151,1.0672,3.0905,2.2696,0.6012,0.305,0.0001,2.4115,1.7303,3.7105,0.0975,2.283,0.9574,0.4345,3.8429,1.7764,4.0713,3.489,2.3656,1.6791,2.6369,2.3084,2.071,0.1218,3.5525,0.0188,0.5527,1.7187,2.0826,1.7657,3.1452,0.364,0.3621,0.0001,3.0404,0.8922,4.5581,1.6599,3.6991,1.6571,1.1817,5.6347,1.3298,0.5966,0.6945,0.4395,0.0003,3.8802,2.1358,1.8463,1.4331,0.0008,1.4638,4.0184,0.4971,0.5602,3.0324,2.3684,0.4439,0.5924,0.0004,5.6331,4.5096,3.9824,4.2968,3.1181,0.1497,6.5195,5.5747,0.2709,0.0328,1.5632,4.4586,2.1871,2.2436,1.9872,0.5555,0.5714,1.4858,0.5877,0.0002,3.8102,2.6064,4.6364,6.327,3.6459,5.7818,2.7485,5.3366,2.6304,1.5866,2.9013,4.976,0.6763,1.7016,3.4045,4.4428,0.0036,2.9576,0.1496,0.2295,4.0141,2.7445,1.4926,5.0443,0.7082,5.7944,0.513,7.7925,0.4981,1.7798,0.3808,6.6797,0.0472,0.36,0.8588,1.3546,3.3599,1.804,1.0101,0.2027,0.2317,4.3509,0.5006,0.0856,0.0002,1.9534,2.3955,2.1247,0.5572,2.963,4.8311,0.2271,4.7294,0.3178,2.5832,1.2461,2.6946,1.6603,5.7966,0.7983,0.6332,2.1639,0.5704,3.6081,6.3969,1.0848,0.0771,1.9612,0.4485,0.459,5.0728,0.03,3.6394,0.0416,0.0339,0.1851,3.1987,0.2187,0.9202,0.3749,1.2029,1.9426,0.0832,5.7246,3.412,1.0244,1.2644,2.7736,1.9143,1.0868,1.7815,2.5028,5.989,2.6499,2.342,4.7595,3.4924,0.89,0.3283,0.0001,4.4181,2.6103,0.0056,1.2998,0.3042,0.2911,2.5042,0.724,0.3171,4.6047,1.268,2.3896,1.9948,5.3638,0.0168,1.2921,0.3714,0.0847,0.9563,2.0446,5.7466,5.2379,4.9569,0.0475,0.9848,4.0072,4.3161,5.4625,0.7762,2.0445,0.4848,3.3764,0.448,3.0052,5.6844,5.3738,1.2125,0.1496,0.5109]}
{"id":4341,"ended":true,"length":663,"gen_text":"You discover that there is a database on the Internet that contains video files depicting the last two minutes of each person's life. When you try to find yours, you realize that there is no entry for you. You are asked to provide your current location to enable the search. The man who responds refuses because he cannot locate his parents' home. You discover that the man actually grew up in the same town as you, and he is your brother. You become even more annoyed when you discover that his parents live far away - over 1000 miles away, and that he cannot find where he lives because he can't find his birth certificate or baptismal certificate or birth certificate of his parents. When you return home to find that your father has become homeless and cannot find any way to contact his long lost sibling, the fact that you are related to your brother causes alarm. As a solution, your brother leaves you the keys to your room, which you use to start searching for your birth certificate. You begin to search and soon realize what will happen if you cannot find your birth certificate - you will likely be disowned by your family and friends for having violated a taboo. It turns out that in this age of digital technology, there is not one birth certificate that corresponds to every country. Each birth certificate is unique. When trying to find your birthplace, the search quickly turns into a massive research project, which will take you into the depths of your birth country's history. This is where we will make the game, and we need your help to make it happen.We have spent a year developing the script. The video game is our passion project, but it will not be possible to complete it without your assistance!We have made an extensive cast of characters - the main character and his brother, the son who was abandoned by their mother and the two brothers with whom he formed his own little brotherhood in the woods. Your support will allow us to fully explore these characters in an immersive, story driven virtual world. Your time will be spent exploring a vast amount of fictional locations during each playthrough. Our game will also feature an innovative interaction system that will allow you to share information or interact using objects in the virtual world - this way not only will you be able to help the main character and his brother save the world, but you can also discover something about yourself as you explore the virtual worlds. The entire game will revolve around the concept of the family - you must form and build your own family if you want to survive. We have set out to create an immersive, story driven interactive experience that will introduce you to new, fun and exciting games concepts. A family of family, together living in harmony - it is our long term goal to create this kind of experience and we are confident that you will join us!Check out our video demo to get a feel for what's to come.

{"id":3861,"ended":false,"length":599,"gen_text":"When you wish upon a shooting star, it's actually a satellite, and your wish has been recorded and cataloged. An agent has been assigned to your case.\n\nYour wish that your dream be taken seriously and that the agents of fortune turn up in person. In this case, I feel sorry for those poor agents, because that's really what it is all about. An agent is there to help you make your desire a reality.\n\nThe question is, are you really ready to face the truth about your dreams and whether you really want to give them to a willing agent?\n\nCan you see yourself accepting the fate that is set before you?\n\nCan you handle facing your wishes for what they are: the dreams of a child? Can you accept them for what they are?\n\nCan you see yourself accepting what you want, no matter what?\n\nCan you accept what needs to be accepted?\n\nIf you can, than you can be happy with your choice to go through with your wish.\n\nYou have made a choice that goes against all odds.\n\nYou made yourself a decision.\n\nYou have made your wish.\n\nGood luck, and may you find the agents of fortune when you are most in need of them.\n\n\"Let the wishing feel right: The wish will come true!\"\n\n-Alfred Hitchcock\n\nP.S.: You can download my report and my video report here:\n\nDESTINATION OF THE WINTER STAR, a report\n\nDESTINATION OF THE WHITE SPRING STAR, a report\n\nELECTRONIC SUMMERS AND STAR GATE - my video report\n\nThe Dream World:\n\nThe World of Dreams -\n\nWishing Upon a Shooting Star is the tale of a very young boy named Adam who has a terrible dream: his mother has died, and he has to move to the United States with his aunt and uncle. All goes well during their time there until tragedy strikes, and he has to leave the safety of their life in Canada behind. His family moves to the USA, and it is there Adam meets an old lady named Rose who gives him the gift of the wishes. This is how he finds his destiny in life, by being able to see his dreams fulfilled. When he is 15 years old, he graduates from high school and goes to join a service organization that's based in the UK. Soon he meets his real mother in person, and decides she isn't who he thought she was. His quest to find her continues, and he meets many other people and events.\n\nYou can see that there are two things that happen in the movie (if you've watched my report): a very young Adam, and a child-man named Matthew who also have a big deal with dreams, and it also has the help of several other things. The plot is much more complex than the plot in the movie, and there are multiple twists and turns in the journey.\n\nI hope you enjoyed watching this movie, I think that it is a very touching movie with some awesome special effects, and a plot that isn't as straightforward as the movie. Thanks for reading, hope to see you next time!\n\nRaffy","token_len":667,"entropy":[1.9996,7.8859,1.8813,0.0606,7.8101,0.0033,0.7159,2.7355,1.2715,5.5446,1.5329,7.9316,2.427,1.9472,5.6102,1.3178,3.8285,1.565,6.749,2.12,4.8355,0.4903,1.566,6.5149,5.9601,3.5991,1.3525,1.3528,0.1787,1.9724,2.1319,1.2152,2.4789,0.0044,3.9585,1.8853,6.4264,2.5686,3.7337,3.5286,5.3955,1.1702,2.628,1.7548,2.04,4.0769,3.2093,5.1082,5.2323,1.477,2.4464,2.9748,3.1893,5.586,2.5585,0.8756,0.3376,4.04,5.9522,4.7801,0.061,4.8761,3.3759,0.8875,1.7381,1.7537,4.8949,1.1058,3.8371,1.3304,1.7331,0.9668,3.1282,0.0099,0.4633,5.8478,0.2583,1.9674,3.5018,0.2406,2.1424,0.4188,3.3307,0.7699,6.9763,1.2424,0.0288,0.4114,0.9296,0.0001,2.6507,5.8398,0.7681,0.7409,2.7407,0.1529,3.6399,1.7732,0.5686,4.2429,0.8631,3.7312,1.8669,0.977,2.1669,2.0687,4.4097,1.2813,2.4403,0.7568,0.756,5.5241,0.8665,2.2251,2.5358,5.112,0.6343,0.438,0.6953,0.0002,5.585,0.2668,3.3066,0.9573,4.0446,1.3884,4.5747,0.7397,1.9344,3.2827,0.9837,0.0138,0.617,0.7389,0.0002,2.5085,0.0265,4.8192,4.57,1.7522,5.0021,3.7116,1.8392,0.0862,0.7025,2.9615,3.1491,2.9136,0.3648,1.0827,1.5265,0.8074,3.6015,0.0172,2.548,2.5325,2.0331,0.195,0.02,0.3317,1.1961,0.4692,0.0002,1.8238,0.0224,2.4732,0.6515,0.7677,2.9876,1.2671,2.0783,2.2045,3.4948,0.0144,1.2977,1.5843,0.3135,0.0002,1.4958,0.0126,2.0923,1.7612,6.679,0.0357,0.284,1.5147,0.715,0.2215,0.0002,3.2377,0.3389,0.6171,1.1982,6.5016,0.7854,2.1197,2.6855,1.9823,1.0419,1.1312,3.2118,2.7699,2.9453,1.899,0.4494,0.972,0.7359,0.424,0.7532,0.0002,3.1443,2.5492,3.0258,1.1873,0.9551,2.4789,5.4634,0.5177,2.7078,1.4658,0.7882,1.188,0.0001,1.571,3.3754,5.9638,1.3513,3.9999,1.1545,0.4421,0.0001,1.2603,1.3989,1.7409,1.5298,0.984,1.0501,0.1374,0.0001,4.7162,0.2206,2.1092,1.3909,1.8694,0.8208,1.1421,1.7218,2.6631,0.2191,0.1244,3.4968,0.298,2.3824,3.8909,0.9034,0.0107,0.3498,0.4232,0.1318,0.3384,0.0002,4.5228,5.5441,2.0238,3.5907,6.343,5.2879,5.2333,4.9355,1.6985,3.2709,1.7786,0.4858,3.7162,0.6802,0.0001,2.1393,4.5503,1.5326,0.0396,0.7142,0.6905,0.0002,5.0251,0.1778,0.023,2.7029,3.4513,0.8991,2.9221,1.8504,6.4544,3.2171,2.8985,4.4451,2.4747,1.7671,1.3861,0.8423,0.0002,5.5562,5.582,0.027,0.4076,3.1258,0.7026,5.0765,1.8209,1.7405,4.1238,4.1616,1.3682,2.9733,0.0002,1.8121,0.0182,0.0013,0.0065,0.0284,0.0186,6.1593,4.5605,0.0558,1.6528,0.103,0.179,1.9334,0.1652,0.0002,6.1468,2.7387,1.4977,0.0955,4.559,1.1184,1.9855,2.5797,4.3507,4.3972,0.4582,5.3662,3.2136,1.0453,0.1461,0.5167,0.0002,3.7373,4.9234,4.634,2.4224,2.6887,0.0002,1.888,4.4403,0.3592,0.7673,2.9906,4.6662,0.0002,5.7974,1.065,3.4778,0.561,0.0617,0.0062,3.8507,2.6638,4.854,0.0206,0.6635,5.2541,1.9655,1.1847,1.4339,4.9949,1.8094,2.0436,1.7303,3.7704,0.6599,3.9664,3.3501,1.4798,1.1678,0.5527,1.2052,0.5321,0.6754,1.4809,1.1333,4.6434,1.3628,2.082,3.3957,0.051,1.9521,0.1725,2.9857,0.8587,0.1548,0.4522,5.4055,2.7482,0.2096,5.1685,1.8392,2.9749,1.6318,1.3702,4.6673,0.0593,2.7145,0.5627,3.1918,2.2676,0.0971,1.4677,2.5034,2.8617,0.099,2.2082,3.9798,0.5475,2.3467,2.7637,0.6119,3.805,4.582,4.0175,0.6872,1.223,4.0176,0.7538,0.6923,4.2206,0.8017,0.9194,4.499,1.0653,3.3554,2.1771,3.8608,1.1495,4.6228,1.8282,3.76,0.0507,1.9609,2.1194,0.0338,2.8573,4.978,0.9252,4.0406,1.7469,2.4819,1.4587,2.9696,1.9683,3.3607,3.0207,1.3486,1.6511,4.3829,3.7788,0.849,0.0031,3.6729,1.3915,1.1708,3.1247,0.5693,4.6893,0.9801,1.9145,4.6838,0.8458,0.0169,0.2168,0.8444,5.8703,0.5876,0.2917,0.0113,0.7567,2.1888,0.62,6.4869,3.6146,4.9467,2.3077,2.9503,5.9457,2.9202,0.3876,1.5724,4.7849,0.2258,5.2921,1.5646,1.4391,2.793,5.3714,3.0438,3.5451,1.1965,0.5206,0.4798,4.7858,4.7964,4.9391,0.0013,2.6963,0.3045,0.6921,0.1094,0.0125,0.342,3.4439,5.4701,1.0372,0.392,2.2707,1.5761,0.6819,0.5212,1.1024,2.1061,1.395,2.0295,0.9465,3.3679,3.6285,4.1921,1.7439,0.0002,4.0913,0.7088,3.5388,4.8967,3.185,0.8491,3.1107,4.0585,0.7217,2.7142,0.6384,1.1315,3.1073,5.5943,4.267,0.1613,4.0336,1.603,3.5545,1.0941,1.4782,4.2345,4.2497,2.0946,1.5666,2.7967,0.3988,1.1013,4.8929,3.0299,4.888,1.3398,5.9119,1.8834,4.9095,5.499,1.2669,5.9463,5.7303,0.9868,1.7884,2.253,1.0178,4.4173,4.8594,2.486,2.568,4.8538,0.0721,5.2026,1.2467,3.9875,1.6999,2.5297,4.9924,1.1084,5.293,0.8074,0.8898,0.2736,2.0475,3.0771,2.2545,0.8372,0.7168,0.7349,1.157,2.5385,0.4935,4.2037,4.3412,0.5113,0.1201,2.1681,0.4985,4.4102,1.1068,0.8705,0.0002,2.5465,2.4121,0.3796,1.088,4.1313,1.6406,1.2649,0.9341,4.0916,2.7171,3.3681,0.5447,1.2277,1.0248,0.921,4.0176,1.6525,2.6607,2.6971,5.1153,3.4294,0.0385,1.6261,0.532,2.0632,4.4569,0.2284,4.6579,0.0006,2.4287,2.4697,0.1153,1.0998,0.3204,1.5677,5.6202,0.1383,0.9249,1.2908,4.8723,1.8661,0.3269,0.0806,1.4953,0.1164,0.7279,0.548,0.0002,5.092,4.7331,2.4979]}

This is later retconned and Joker actually is just a normal guy, and the town he created is just a small town called Apokolips in the Middle East, that has been affected by the death of the Joker's daughter and the Batman's actions.\n\nLiterature\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nMusic\n\nThe song \"The Night of the Vampires\" by New Orleans metal band Black Sabbath is the story of a vampire trying to murder the son of a vampire.

And the cycle continues.\n\nThe song \"The Vampire's Ball\" by David Bowie is told as the story of how a vampire (in this case, a demon) murders a young vampire. His son, who was also killed (and reincarnated as a different vampire), is determined to ensure that his son's death was not in vain: he is going to kill several other evil vampires so that no vampire can ever murder his son again as they did to his sister.\n\nVideo Games\n\nVisual Novels\n\nEuphonium has this; it's the story of how a noble boy named Eugene meets Nino, a kind-hearted girl from a poor family at Uffizi, and their romance begins.\n\n, a kind-hearted girl from a poor family at Uffizi, and their romance begins.

He tries to commit suicide and gets help from the girl of his dreams, but it isn't enough...\n\nWeb Animation\n\nThe Vampire Chronicles is full of one: The second one begins with the vampires who attempted to kill the first vampire and killed his wife being burned at the stake after trying to make peace between the two families.\n\nWeb Comics\n\nWeb Original\n\nThe Vampire Chronicles is full of some of these, not just in the story, but the characters. Among them are one who is on his way back from a visit from a group he killed and killed the second human he ever met. Another who is seeking revenge upon a pair of vampires who tried to turn him. A few who don't even bother to look for them, and most of the others are just very self-obsessed. A few even seem to be a parody of vampires. The Vampire Slayer had one, since no one saw it coming... (the point of it being \"everyone\" didn't really matter, since they were vampires in the beginning and were only discovered after most of the characters had died)\n\n\nWestern Animation","token_len":667,"entropy":[9.1161,4.374,8.9827,0.7019,4.2536,0.2998,8.4892,0.5385,1.9787,6.7938,5.924,0.1042,9.0321,1.8207,1.4191,1.4733,2.7714,6.2011,1.0383,0.4949,2.9108,1.8868,1.2991,5.0292,6.8523,2.4926,4.6515,1.9636,0.0509,5.0164,2.0731,1.0273,0.0229,2.6154,0.2486,0.4128,1.6745,0.013,3.0722,4.1715,5.5461,5.4163,1.5755,1.2259,1.2874,0.2324,1.8735,3.397,3.627,2.2253,0.0913,1.335,0.0001,0.0001,3.8612,2.2733,5.825,0.003,1.5435,2.1169,0.0115,0.7077,3.2024,0.5403,3.3492,0.062,3.878,5.259,1.2725,2.9008,0.4697,1.8094,5.2478,0.0101,0.3735,1.7871,1.4843,1.6895,2.4854,3.7295,5.1802,0.0494,3.2486,2.5478,1.6165,3.9811,5.2134,1.8614,0.7363,2.9902,1.3895,4.8135,3.713,0.0275,0.0061,3.0782,2.5849,4.2574,4.0235,4.2708,0.9723,1.4363,1.2136,1.8007,2.1613,1.6755,1.1389,2.9987,0.6747,1.0016,2.3548,0.7446,3.1364,2.3171,4.1051,4.7606,0.4286,0.09,0.0016,3.9869,0.5623,4.2064,0.0493,1.8106,4.4497,2.8118,1.32,4.9578,0.0616,1.0715,4.6581,0.0168,1.5555,1.3715,0.135,0.1398,2.945,1.9835,4.4614,1.1627,2.6736,0.7451,0.4761,0.0002,2.9332,0.002,0.0138,0.0002,0.4932,0.6308,0.0015,0.0115,0.003,0.0002,1.5071,0.0264,0.0003,1.529,1.9095,0.2998,2.0196,4.7683,2.8637,0.1534,5.3709,1.393,0.1737,0.5407,5.6811,4.3357,4.5236,0.1152,3.9678,0.8857,1.3184,4.3314,0.782,0.0106,0.3917,1.5697,2.9099,0.0127,4.6316,1.7562,4.5666,0.0497,0.5885,1.3675,1.2255,1.6901,1.68,3.8921,2.5194,0.846,0.9132,2.4884,4.2861,3.4694,5.9974,0.8773,0.9766,0.8492,3.6707,0.1541,1.2221,0.2462,0.5209,1.5762,0.9839,0.78,0.7634,0.045,0.673,0.1757,6.0954,1.2825,0.5266,0.7098,1.9992,0.7833,0.1566,0.0722,1.1105,0.2495,0.0412,0.3494,0.0366,6.7274,2.7236,2.3052,1.5068,0.835,0.5967,0.2702,0.0002,1.6329,1.4085,0.0924,1.6269,3.4086,2.2132,3.3636,0.4125,0.1136,5.6804,0.6385,1.1497,4.7381,3.1478,1.2556,0.3754,0.0131,4.2526,0.8413,0.6852,3.88,3.9177,0.9196,0.0444,0.9046,0.9863,5.1902,0.414,4.7085,1.1102,3.1148,3.9626,1.9242,5.1807,2.3034,2.1085,1.4494,1.8325,2.5948,2.9537,5.0918,2.0899,4.7439,0.0534,1.0669,0.2654,4.4839,0.4753,0.6749,1.6335,4.9463,0.0662,5.9334,0.457,1.5311,2.7497,1.2514,1.4412,3.3038,1.0924,0.0715,0.0003,4.4237,1.9942,3.0925,1.753,0.0277,1.3793,6.5547,1.2938,5.8348,0.5784,4.0436,0.2389,3.2341,2.6539,2.0285,0.5545,2.7867,0.7702,0.3562,0.5305,7.4291,3.4426,1.8245,1.2942,1.3939,6.741,0.4246,0.5222,0.0002,3.1118,0.0034,0.0065,0.0003,1.8361,0.001,0.0124,0.0079,0.0003,5.7513,4.764,1.5935,0.0034,2.379,1.7124,6.004,2.5116,0.5696,1.635,0.9492,0.0331,2.168,2.2125,4.5576,4.0105,2.5043,3.9377,4.0207,6.7211,2.6995,0.7355,0.8893,5.7326,1.3534,0.04,1.2176,2.4267,1.0609,1.454,0.2154,6.3505,7.8586,2.4957,0.0651,0.0783,1.1794,0.6433,3.3805,3.3836,3.2714,0.703,1.6825,0.0002,10.155,1.8449,1.6205,0.0077,0.0001,0.0004,0.0007,0.0008,0.0002,0.0001,0.0016,0.0009,0.0001,0.0003,0.0001,0.0022,0.003,0.0018,0.0059,0.0007,0.0011,4.4305,0.436,0.2326,2.4893,6.9695,0.658,1.2129,2.5153,2.5787,2.7739,1.2333,5.457,0.9543,1.4227,2.435,0.0306,1.2999,0.3497,3.3996,0.2076,2.1598,1.5621,3.3391,3.7029,3.1929,4.902,0.8183,1.9548,1.2453,1.1511,3.4273,4.8239,1.3328,2.1602,5.4935,1.0425,1.2022,0.0162,0.68,2.0092,3.062,0.0598,3.3992,0.0365,2.7164,3.4405,2.9924,0.2635,2.168,3.5575,3.7443,0.1367,0.212,1.0199,0.8244,2.7969,3.7604,0.0006,0.3399,3.6655,0.6423,0.0002,0.7917,1.5805,0.0276,0.0002,2.6727,4.7052,5.0851,3.0792,5.1415,0.012,4.5558,3.9847,2.1123,5.6013,3.6108,3.5223,0.4239,1.4936,5.4251,2.9452,5.8709,0.0793,0.7225,1.3663,2.5959,1.0474,3.1815,4.0352,1.565,2.2865,3.9006,4.9364,0.4944,0.0099,0.0002,4.8055,3.8731,0.0507,4.4678,4.4483,3.1163,1.2024,0.5928,1.968,0.4548,1.4011,0.0002,0.9508,0.2054,0.0164,0.0002,0.5516,0.0212,0.043,0.0003,2.4742,3.3018,3.7447,2.2242,0.7866,0.0028,5.8142,1.2645,0.2267,1.6413,5.1773,1.6574,2.6668,0.5496,2.9674,1.4226,0.032,3.5671,2.4268,2.3516,6.2943,0.9426,1.2243,4.822,1.7999,2.5267,5.6157,2.4788,0.6462,4.6539,0.9147,1.8754,4.3892,4.0571,2.1348,5.5288,4.5433,3.0812,2.28,3.8926,2.2587,4.2927,5.7403,0.4943,1.8457,1.0975,1.3456,2.092,1.3347,1.6902,5.0901,0.8374,4.7847,1.6068,5.9029,0.0344,1.2932,0.3824,2.21,0.0375,4.557,0.2487,2.1146,1.7459,3.4647,1.3078,4.6406,0.001,2.0182,3.8233,0.7267,4.7739,1.4173,3.6213,1.5909,2.1192,5.4935,0.7748,1.4545,3.0707,2.0925,1.9925,5.1918,5.3251,0.1191,4.0389,0.0013,1.1747,3.7913,1.1354,3.3074,3.6445,0.2598,1.3479,4.1676,4.8624,0.1223,2.4412,1.4866,2.3599,4.1049,3.5867,3.7464,1.7743,2.3963,5.2272,5.736,0.6219,6.1593,1.5462,0.0167,3.8798,5.4187,4.5083,5.8423,1.1386,2.9562,0.9482,4.3804,4.1489,1.3415,3.2571,0.0006,2.658,1.3042,1.6272,1.3972,2.8117,1.223,2.5566,3.5209,0.8059,3.2788,2.6387,3.0517,3.8353,3.9624,2.5003,5.6825,0.2757,0.1914,2.0768,1.1584,1.3864,2.0466,2.1247,0.0003,0.1136,0.0008]}
{"id":692,"ended":false,"length":599,"gen_text":"When you wish upon a shooting star, it's actually a satellite, and your wish has been recorded and cataloged. An agent has been assigned to your case.\n\nYour wish that your dream be taken seriously and that the agents of fortune turn up in person. In this case, I feel sorry for those poor agents, because that's really what it is all about. An agent is there to help you make your desire a reality.\n\nThe question is, are you really ready to face the truth about your dreams and whether you really want to give them to a willing agent?\n\nCan you see yourself accepting the fate that is set before you?\n\nCan you handle facing your wishes for what they are: the dreams of a child? Can you accept them for what they are?\n\nCan you see yourself accepting what you want, no matter what?\n\nCan you accept what needs to be accepted?\n\nIf you can, than you can be happy with your choice to go through with your wish.\n\nYou have made a choice that goes against all odds.\n\nYou made yourself a decision.\n\nYou have made your wish.\n\nGood luck, and may you find the agents of fortune when you are most in need of them.\n\n\"Let the wishing feel right: The wish will come true!\"\n\n-Alfred Hitchcock\n\nP.S.: You can download my report and my video report here:\n\nDESTINATION OF THE WINTER STAR, a report\n\nDESTINATION OF THE WHITE SPRING STAR, a report\n\nELECTRONIC SUMMERS AND STAR GATE - my video report\n\nThe Dream World:\n\nThe World of Dreams -\n\nWishing Upon a Shooting Star is the tale of a very young boy named Adam who has a terrible dream: his mother has died, and he has to move to the United States with his aunt and uncle. All goes well during their time there until tragedy strikes, and he has to leave the safety of their life in Canada behind. His family moves to the USA, and it is there Adam meets an old lady named Rose who gives him the gift of the wishes. This is how he finds his destiny in life, by being able to see his dreams fulfilled. When he is 15 years old, he graduates from high school and goes to join a service organization that's based in the UK. Soon he meets his real mother in person, and decides she isn't who he thought she was. His quest to find her continues, and he meets many other people and events.\n\nYou can see that there are two things that happen in the movie (if you've watched my report): a very young Adam, and a child-man named Matthew who also have a big deal with dreams, and it also has the help of several other things. The plot is much more complex than the plot in the movie, and there are multiple twists and turns in the journey.\n\nI hope you enjoyed watching this movie, I think that it is a very touching movie with some awesome special effects, and a plot that isn't as straightforward as the movie. Thanks for reading, hope to see you next time!\n\nRaffy","token_len":667,"entropy":[1.9996,7.8859,1.8813,0.0606,7.8101,0.0033,0.7159,2.7355,1.2715,5.5446,1.5329,7.9316,2.427,1.9472,5.6102,1.3178,3.8285,1.565,6.749,2.12,4.8355,0.4903,1.566,6.5149,5.9601,3.5991,1.3525,1.3528,0.1787,1.9724,2.1319,1.2152,2.4789,0.0044,3.9585,1.8853,6.4264,2.5686,3.7337,3.5286,5.3955,1.1702,2.628,1.7548,2.04,4.0769,3.2093,5.1082,5.2323,1.477,2.4464,2.9748,3.1893,5.586,2.5585,0.8756,0.3376,4.04,5.9522,4.7801,0.061,4.8761,3.3759,0.8875,1.7381,1.7537,4.8949,1.1058,3.8371,1.3304,1.7331,0.9668,3.1282,0.0099,0.4633,5.8478,0.2583,1.9674,3.5018,0.2406,2.1424,0.4188,3.3307,0.7699,6.9763,1.2424,0.0288,0.4114,0.9296,0.0001,2.6507,5.8398,0.7681,0.7409,2.7407,0.1529,3.6399,1.7732,0.5686,4.2429,0.8631,3.7312,1.8669,0.977,2.1669,2.0687,4.4097,1.2813,2.4403,0.7568,0.756,5.5241,0.8665,2.2251,2.5358,5.112,0.6343,0.438,0.6953,0.0002,5.585,0.2668,3.3066,0.9573,4.0446,1.3884,4.5747,0.7397,1.9344,3.2827,0.9837,0.0138,0.617,0.7389,0.0002,2.5085,0.0265,4.8192,4.57,1.7522,5.0021,3.7116,1.8392,0.0862,0.7025,2.9615,3.1491,2.9136,0.3648,1.0827,1.5265,0.8074,3.6015,0.0172,2.548,2.5325,2.0331,0.195,0.02,0.3317,1.1961,0.4692,0.0002,1.8238,0.0224,2.4732,0.6515,0.7677,2.9876,1.2671,2.0783,2.2045,3.4948,0.0144,1.2977,1.5843,0.3135,0.0002,1.4958,0.0126,2.0923,1.7612,6.679,0.0357,0.284,1.5147,0.715,0.2215,0.0002,3.2377,0.3389,0.6171,1.1982,6.5016,0.7854,2.1197,2.6855,1.9823,1.0419,1.1312,3.2118,2.7699,2.9453,1.899,0.4494,0.972,0.7359,0.424,0.7532,0.0002,3.1443,2.5492,3.0258,1.1873,0.9551,2.4789,5.4634,0.5177,2.7078,1.4658,0.7882,1.188,0.0001,1.571,3.3754,5.9638,1.3513,3.9999,1.1545,0.4421,0.0001,1.2603,1.3989,1.7409,1.5298,0.984,1.0501,0.1374,0.0001,4.7162,0.2206,2.1092,1.3909,1.8694,0.8208,1.1421,1.7218,2.6631,0.2191,0.1244,3.4968,0.298,2.3824,3.8909,0.9034,0.0107,0.3498,0.4232,0.1318,0.3384,0.0002,4.5228,5.5441,2.0238,3.5907,6.343,5.2879,5.2333,4.9355,1.6985,3.2709,1.7786,0.4858,3.7162,0.6802,0.0001,2.1393,4.5503,1.5326,0.0396,0.7142,0.6905,0.0002,5.0251,0.1778,0.023,2.7029,3.4513,0.8991,2.9221,1.8504,6.4544,3.2171,2.8985,4.4451,2.4747,1.7671,1.3861,0.8423,0.0002,5.5562,5.582,0.027,0.4076,3.1258,0.7026,5.0765,1.8209,1.7405,4.1238,4.1616,1.3682,2.9733,0.0002,1.8121,0.0182,0.0013,0.0065,0.0284,0.0186,6.1593,4.5605,0.0558,1.6528,0.103,0.179,1.9334,0.1652,0.0002,6.1468,2.7387,1.4977,0.0955,4.559,1.1184,1.9855,2.5797,4.3507,4.3972,0.4582,5.3662,3.2136,1.0453,0.1461,0.5167,0.0002,3.7373,4.9234,4.634,2.4224,2.6887,0.0002,1.888,4.4403,0.3592,0.7673,2.9906,4.6662,0.0002,5.7974,1.065,3.4778,0.561,0.0617,0.0062,3.8507,2.6638,4.854,0.0206,0.6635,5.2541,1.9655,1.1847,1.4339,4.9949,1.8094,2.0436,1.7303,3.7704,0.6599,3.9664,3.3501,1.4798,1.1678,0.5527,1.2052,0.5321,0.6754,1.4809,1.1333,4.6434,1.3628,2.082,3.3957,0.051,1.9521,0.1725,2.9857,0.8587,0.1548,0.4522,5.4055,2.7482,0.2096,5.1685,1.8392,2.9749,1.6318,1.3702,4.6673,0.0593,2.7145,0.5627,3.1918,2.2676,0.0971,1.4677,2.5034,2.8617,0.099,2.2082,3.9798,0.5475,2.3467,2.7637,0.6119,3.805,4.582,4.0175,0.6872,1.223,4.0176,0.7538,0.6923,4.2206,0.8017,0.9194,4.499,1.0653,3.3554,2.1771,3.8608,1.1495,4.6228,1.8282,3.76,0.0507,1.9609,2.1194,0.0338,2.8573,4.978,0.9252,4.0406,1.7469,2.4819,1.4587,2.9696,1.9683,3.3607,3.0207,1.3486,1.6511,4.3829,3.7788,0.849,0.0031,3.6729,1.3915,1.1708,3.1247,0.5693,4.6893,0.9801,1.9145,4.6838,0.8458,0.0169,0.2168,0.8444,5.8703,0.5876,0.2917,0.0113,0.7567,2.1888,0.62,6.4869,3.6146,4.9467,2.3077,2.9503,5.9457,2.9202,0.3876,1.5724,4.7849,0.2258,5.2921,1.5646,1.4391,2.793,5.3714,3.0438,3.5451,1.1965,0.5206,0.4798,4.7858,4.7964,4.9391,0.0013,2.6963,0.3045,0.6921,0.1094,0.0125,0.342,3.4439,5.4701,1.0372,0.392,2.2707,1.5761,0.6819,0.5212,1.1024,2.1061,1.395,2.0295,0.9465,3.3679,3.6285,4.1921,1.7439,0.0002,4.0913,0.7088,3.5388,4.8967,3.185,0.8491,3.1107,4.0585,0.7217,2.7142,0.6384,1.1315,3.1073,5.5943,4.267,0.1613,4.0336,1.603,3.5545,1.0941,1.4782,4.2345,4.2497,2.0946,1.5666,2.7967,0.3988,1.1013,4.8929,3.0299,4.888,1.3398,5.9119,1.8834,4.9095,5.499,1.2669,5.9463,5.7303,0.9868,1.7884,2.253,1.0178,4.4173,4.8594,2.486,2.568,4.8538,0.0721,5.2026,1.2467,3.9875,1.6999,2.5297,4.9924,1.1084,5.293,0.8074,0.8898,0.2736,2.0475,3.0771,2.2545,0.8372,0.7168,0.7349,1.157,2.5385,0.4935,4.2037,4.3412,0.5113,0.1201,2.1681,0.4985,4.4102,1.1068,0.8705,0.0002,2.5465,2.4121,0.3796,1.088,4.1313,1.6406,1.2649,0.9341,4.0916,2.7171,3.3681,0.5447,1.2277,1.0248,0.921,4.0176,1.6525,2.6607,2.6971,5.1153,3.4294,0.0385,1.6261,0.532,2.0632,4.4569,0.2284,4.6579,0.0006,2.4287,2.4697,0.1153,1.0998,0.3204,1.5677,5.6202,0.1383,0.9249,1.2908,4.8723,1.8661,0.3269,0.0806,1.4953,0.1164,0.7279,0.548,0.0002,5.092,4.7331,2.4979]}
{"id":1639,"ended":false,"length":580,"gen_text":"Write a short fantasy story with as many cliches as possible, and send it in. (Yes, I know, many short stories seem to lack creativity.)\n\nSend it to Kaimana @ Kaimana-Fantasy_Fiction@yahoo.com and send me an email containing your story synopsis and brief summary of your work so I can determine if my taste is up your alley.\n\nI have lots of short stories that I need to read!\n\nKaimana is NOT a genre. It's a name that I created to differentiate my writing from others because I thought it sounded good. I wanted to see if readers would find what I wanted to read, so I created a category to hold more than one type of story. My stories are either fantasy with little action (My Favourite Fantasy Story Ever), fantasy with a little action (I Know I'm a Fantasy Fanboy\u2026), modern romance with a little sci-fi\/dishonored action\/sex (Sci-fi in Sexy Time), and mystery\/suspense\/thriller set in a modern setting.\n\nAnd, although Kaimana is NOT a genre, the stories within those genres often happen to be in it. (I will say that I have created fantasy\/modern romance without romance, so there are readers out there who are probably more comfortable with my work).\n\nWhy Not Just Go Book-By-Book\n\nI find it helps you focus on one story at a time and get into it, and that's when you start to learn how to write, and I find the experience is invaluable.\n\nThis isn't a tutorial I want you to do. I just want you to have an idea what types of stories I have written. It is my intention to release ONE collection a week, so if you want to start with a set amount of stories you can work your way up from there.\n\nThe first story was put out just a few weeks ago. It's a series of short pieces, about one page long. It's called My Favourite Fantasy Story Ever and it's about a woman who travels to India to find her dead wife, and falls in love with a Muslim man.\n\nI'll be making another story for next week, starting with a female character named Lottie \u2013 I didn't really want to go over all of her character traits. She is a thief, a slag, an oddball, a troublemaker, a strong willed woman\u2026she's a great character.\n\nAs with most of my stories, you'll see multiple versions of my stories released a week. Some are all dialogue and no pictures. Some are mostly pictures, and some are full on pictures of Lottie in action. You can see most of Lottie's previous adventures here, including an early attempt at a non-fiction book about Lottie in the shape of a scrapbook.\n\nIf you're interested in my short-story idea list, I suggest you read it (including the links as I write them up) and come back here after you have completed your reading of your stories. There you will find links to where you can purchase the short stories to help with your collection.\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":667,"entropy":[3.5497,5.5331,8.7158,1.2849,3.1625,5.1495,1.0658,7.03,0.312,0.0176,0.2789,0.895,1.8611,1.6851,2.8985,0.3431,2.0591,0.9902,3.6763,4.7078,0.0708,1.6663,1.1239,2.0126,5.4713,4.5565,0.2444,5.544,0.4578,4.1424,3.9581,2.0556,1.2036,0.0182,4.1022,2.5735,0.4494,6.4071,4.2878,3.8176,4.9667,3.1375,0.0744,0.028,3.5183,3.3811,0.2871,6.2946,1.6355,1.1721,1.2097,0.9866,0.0024,0.0733,3.1776,4.5296,0.8446,2.6213,0.2644,4.1529,1.2045,1.0023,3.438,1.2127,4.9552,2.9119,1.4355,0.9998,2.6536,3.4048,0.5164,0.1508,5.7374,0.5536,4.0244,4.1075,0.9645,3.81,3.5958,0.0038,0.2205,0.7559,0.0001,2.5132,3.5571,5.2026,0.0585,3.6539,0.1984,2.1725,0.6466,4.7393,0.5609,0.8539,2.8843,1.1159,0.0002,4.5617,0.1092,0.0124,2.2014,5.9819,1.2292,4.0059,1.9579,1.3056,0.8828,0.7832,4.333,2.0647,0.9609,2.5658,1.1077,4.0338,0.7354,1.7891,0.3619,3.1149,4.5768,0.865,3.8877,0.5477,0.9529,3.256,0.4308,1.8174,4.7242,0.6456,5.1918,0.4181,3.8282,0.4842,2.9415,5.455,0.0443,4.0261,0.5214,0.7542,2.1493,1.7227,0.1656,1.1769,0.9037,3.5774,2.9364,4.3584,7.1195,0.9209,0.7284,1.7124,0.0146,1.9288,0.292,4.0895,2.0939,0.788,4.139,1.5351,4.8803,5.4295,4.4918,2.725,4.8922,4.9764,0.8214,0.0065,1.0411,3.5508,1.9995,1.4812,2.4346,0.174,1.7791,1.7468,0.1475,0.3601,3.251,5.1948,2.7974,1.1509,2.1249,1.4535,1.732,2.5314,5.2056,0.2905,6.6618,2.2991,1.7743,1.0097,0.8293,5.8791,0.0631,0.0013,2.3991,6.6402,4.6961,0.1878,0.3937,1.6855,4.2371,3.969,0.3146,4.2346,3.6331,0.5463,0.7651,4.3354,6.3991,3.9066,0.7266,2.9575,4.726,1.3052,1.0942,0.0018,1.484,0.9169,0.0241,0.0006,6.6961,0.0601,1.036,1.9359,1.7225,2.4409,0.8375,0.0002,4.8425,2.6392,5.5389,2.8825,0.0056,0.0019,0.6256,2.9726,0.2132,0.1606,0.129,3.6998,1.4438,2.6848,4.6316,1.27,4.208,5.4416,0.4218,0.9283,2.6641,2.8164,0.4343,3.8098,2.0782,4.4065,3.0248,0.6995,1.3465,1.8837,5.4109,5.6502,2.7032,2.8353,1.1082,3.9675,4.4605,1.6169,2.3819,2.9825,1.8895,4.7277,1.3168,0.0019,0.5024,2.4322,3.9509,4.3987,3.2107,0.2978,4.8686,3.3401,4.8098,0.3374,0.0002,5.138,5.1505,2.6068,3.9746,5.6722,1.6057,1.8639,0.0026,0.0016,2.5105,0.0002,1.5762,4.963,1.2441,5.5784,4.4298,3.8421,0.4446,2.3292,1.1197,0.544,0.0074,0.0008,2.567,3.1993,2.917,1.1676,1.933,1.874,3.2855,1.0417,4.4296,0.9089,3.4648,0.6665,2.7933,2.4548,0.536,0.5507,3.4485,1.2264,3.7148,2.2448,3.7593,4.6376,2.597,5.2087,0.3154,1.1912,0.0002,4.7721,3.3216,0.0005,1.3864,5.1752,4.6547,2.5994,0.9476,0.0198,3.2185,2.283,1.0909,2.7122,0.2462,0.2328,0.0135,2.464,1.5593,0.2213,3.7309,4.8952,0.0037,0.1673,1.1627,3.8754,1.6005,1.9723,3.4863,3.6888,2.9752,3.6031,0.4383,5.0967,5.8753,5.0239,2.5249,2.6813,1.009,1.5147,2.1801,0.1887,1.4593,0.2808,3.667,1.9759,1.8379,5.6273,6.0181,0.427,0.2538,2.9866,0.5829,5.2162,0.7725,0.0035,0.2317,1.6317,0.0445,0.177,0.5064,0.0002,3.3637,3.2536,2.8622,5.0952,6.1636,1.3285,4.5861,1.4237,0.4455,1.3883,0.0777,1.246,1.6723,0.7342,1.4903,5.2882,0.5361,1.3487,5.0196,2.169,3.7994,3.8303,1.4607,1.4604,1.4834,1.8392,0.7063,2.2991,3.7744,0.4607,0.0003,0.0009,0.0374,0.0245,0.0083,1.6011,1.1105,0.5916,1.4333,0.6015,3.4724,0.5509,3.8051,1.0523,7.0116,0.8561,1.6784,0.5543,4.0904,5.0817,1.9,1.3778,4.3139,0.1603,0.0189,0.165,0.7637,4.4332,0.8958,0.8692,1.0992,0.0002,2.0052,3.2273,1.088,4.8427,3.4843,2.0254,3.8843,4.8564,0.2994,1.3656,5.7334,0.7903,1.1749,5.18,2.0157,3.752,4.3151,4.7084,0.0494,5.7629,3.0092,5.3175,0.0004,4.6531,1.6887,0.4051,3.5309,5.8343,2.5531,1.8562,1.9092,2.564,1.2832,3.733,2.1826,1.9038,0.9178,4.1355,0.806,1.2584,5.656,4.7616,0.1759,2.9101,5.5025,0.7165,0.3543,1.3842,5.1684,0.1395,0.4038,1.4469,5.6862,1.8107,0.0003,0.6234,3.6564,3.3583,0.5657,1.7236,4.2872,0.4958,1.2027,0.7755,0.0002,4.6078,3.2384,1.975,1.0393,0.2851,0.566,0.1694,3.2299,2.1089,2.5326,5.4464,2.1217,0.2379,3.2086,3.3261,5.7977,4.0404,0.1951,0.5354,3.2807,1.5639,5.5284,4.7695,1.969,2.497,1.5532,1.5658,0.8195,0.5235,3.8964,0.4944,1.2906,1.1476,0.3579,0.3952,2.9181,3.2127,2.6338,3.0905,3.2157,0.007,0.0005,2.443,1.9958,0.2704,3.1304,1.0423,1.5995,5.8668,0.0705,3.7825,0.0056,0.0022,0.1658,4.7538,2.0794,1.6184,2.815,2.994,4.0578,2.9711,4.4016,0.1993,1.334,5.5866,0.036,1.9853,0.9225,2.2954,2.635,0.0044,0.0009,4.6792,1.7921,5.756,0.0052,0.5321,5.626,0.0434,0.4157,0.3707,0.0002,2.6307,0.1332,1.9095,0.8304,0.1831,2.8056,4.5799,5.1638,1.2843,5.9442,3.773,0.271,2.568,3.8177,0.4369,2.2656,1.2668,4.7634,5.9705,0.8505,4.2177,5.6048,1.6508,2.4317,0.4009,3.8636,0.981,1.0828,3.6979,0.4868,1.7376,3.4521,0.4372,2.4299,3.197,1.0731,2.0542,3.0366,4.154,2.0864,0.432,4.0783,3.7813,1.1139,0.3723,1.7755,0.0722,3.526,0.6167,0.0437,1.6218,1.1311,3.9851,0.3409,5.1655,2.8032,2.9595,0.3703,2.963,0.389,0.3859,0.0002,4.5663]}
{"id":3471,"ended":false,"length":599,"gen_text":"An old man is found, delirious, unstable, lost in his own world, replaying his traumatising moment on a daily basis.\n\nIs it that people need therapy to heal or that these therapists are just overly sensitive because of trauma?\n\nI'm also wondering how we can identify 'therapists' in the first place, since therapists are typically identified as professionals using training and training qualifications \u2014 and all professionals have experienced trauma.\n\nI've been looking on the internet, and I'm struggling to find examples of therapists who actually work in private practice or have experience working in clinical settings. (For people who don't know, psychotherapy is primarily an office setting where you are interacting with a therapist)\n\nWould you know if any of your psychotherapist friends were therapists, or if they were in the community in other capacities like teaching or working with other mental health professionals?\n\nIf some of your psychotherapist friends have had traumatic experiences themselves, would you think it would be likely that they would have similar vulnerabilities during the therapeutic process?\n\nMaybe it turns out that I was being too paranoid. Maybe there's not as much to PTSD as I thought. If you think so, that's fine. Just because some of your friends are traumatised doesn't mean that others aren't traumatised.\n\nAs a former psychiatrist, is the current way 'counseling' work, and if so is it really working? Why do so many therapists think this stuff is so important that they are willing to 'counsel' people? Why aren't we just using non-academic methods like Mindfulness?\n\nLet's just be honest. The term 'counselling' is used as a euphemism for being an authority figure, a therapist, and in this case being someone who acts as a guide to someone (as in being a therapist's assistant).\n\nThese words have been thrown around by the media to describe the current work being done in this field, and with good reason! People may be afraid to speak out or feel like they'll be accused of being 'crazy' or 'paranoid.'\n\nI would like to hear your experiences and thoughts on this discussion.\n\nThis has been part of my thought process for a while now. When you talk about your mental health or your mental illness\u2026 and you think about being on the receiving end of that kind of treatment I really want to hear more about it. I'm sure there is a whole body of literature to help explain this experience, but this essay does not fit into anything like that.\n\nI think talking about how trauma affects your life has more importance to it than just being a therapist. It really helps my mind feel more human and less like a robot.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful and articulate response!\n\nI'm sorry it took me this long to do this, but the response was much needed, and I appreciate you being a listener and a person who is willing to consider something that I have studied for so long that I can only assume you will have struggled to really understand.\n\nGood

{"id":2874,"ended":false,"length":638,"gen_text":"With a new technology that converts one very basic human emotion into energy, the energy crisis seems solved. Until one day the very huge flaw comes to light.\n\nIn one short afternoon the population of earth will be reduced to 50%.\n\nThe global population has doubled every 10 years since 1970 and keeps on doubling, and that's without taking into account all of the humans that have died over the last 10 years due to HIV\/AIDS, and because of the war.\n\nIt is a very serious problem and this is where I say, it is not a problem for the future, it is definitely a problem now.\n\nI can't understand the logic that allows one planet on earth for each human to survive. If a solar flare destroyed all of humanity, our ability to support ourselves would soon be a thing of the past. I am very grateful to living creatures like myself but I am sure that if it were really the case, it would never happen again.\n\nI can't imagine how a living creature has taken over such a large portion of the earth for so long. I can't imagine how humans in any way have managed to get so powerful. I can't imagine the resources that they are consuming. I can't imagine what they are killing.\n\nIt is a problem for the future, it is also a problem for right now.\n\nThe problem is the waste. At the moment there are 3 billion people and each of them consumes over 6,000 tons of resources a year. That is equivalent to that of a huge American city.\n\nWhat will happen to this level of consumption after the next 50+ years when the population will be reduced to 50% and only then the rest of the world will be affected?\n\nI ask you, what is the impact when the humans are reduced to a few thousand people? I have never even thought about it before but now that we are here, we need to think about this because there will surely be a time when our planet will be reduced to 50%.\n\nA good start may be to start taking care of people. I myself have already started, I've started walking more. I have started trying to educate myself about the impact of the waste. I have started doing my part to help as much as possible. But if my entire life were just to support the one 50% who will now be removed from the world, then I'm sure we will all be very very sorry about what we have done in this world.\n\nOur waste is everywhere, it is in everything. We are wasting not only water but also earth itself.\n\nAs long as we keep living on earth, we will be affected by the Earth. I just hope that my children and grandchildren are not left with all of these problems.\n\nIt is my wish that we can stop wasting and create enough for the people we love. A society that is more caring would be a better society, it will be a healthy society better able to adapt and be able to cope for the future.\n\nI hope that I can make a difference to make this wish come true for my children and grandchildren.

{"id":2597,"ended":false,"length":596,"gen_text":"A lifelong cannibal has his first vegetarian meal \u2013 and it turns out it's really good\n\n\nIt's the age of meat free dining: 'Some people are vegetarians because they never liked the texture, texture of the flesh, it didn't taste the way they wanted it to.\n\nOthers ate meat for flavour before they realised they couldn't eat it.\n\nThese are the main reasons why most people don't eat meat these days.\n\nBut new research suggests that one man's love of meat has triggered a lifetime quest to eat vegetarian meals \u2013 and that it's actually really good.\n\nCannibal: A man's diet of flesh is fuelling his desire to try a vegetarian diet\n\nA lifetime quest to eat vegetarian meals: It's actually really good\n\nDr Michael Bausman from Tel Aviv and his colleagues tracked the diets and health records of more than 1,000 people over a period of 10 years.\n\nAt the start of the study, half the men in the study vowed to eat a vegetarian diet for the rest of their lives. At the end of the study, 80 per cent were still vegetarian.\n\nAt the start of the study, 50 per cent of the men in the study vowed to eat meat. At the end of the study, 80 per cent of the men were still vegetarian.\n\nAt the start of the study, two thirds of the men said they always loved to eat meat. At the end of the study, two thirds said they always hated food.\n\nDr Bausman said: 'This study showed the amazing power of self reflection. When people reflect positively, I believe they improve at life in a big way.\n\n'When people reflect negatively, they are less happy and less healthy.\n\nHe said vegetarians make healthier choices because they believe the environment will not be damaged. The research was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n'The vegetarian diet could be an important part of a healthier, cleaner, more green lifestyle.'\n\nDr Bausman said: 'The health and environment will not be damaged by changing the meat-rich diet, and health and environmental improvements appear to be maintained by adopting one vegetarian diet.\n\nMeat isn't the only thing being sacrificed \u2013 the animal suffers because of its existence too. The study found more than half of the vegetarians gave up meat during the study \u2013 usually for some other reason\n\nThe study found more than half of the vegetarians gave up meat during the study \u2013 usually for some other reason\n\n'This vegan diet does not allow any consumption of meat or other animal products, and we found that the vegan diet is actually healthier than a meat-oriented diet.'\n\nDr Bausman said he was surprised that the study tracked how the vegetarians were doing, and not just how many were vegetarian.\n\nHe said the study was not just about vegetarians, but also

{"id":2630,"ended":false,"length":616,"gen_text":"You move into a new house that's haunted. However, the ghosts are extremely helpful. You come home one day and the laundry is mysteriously folded and dinner is started. You never go to sleep in the house since those ghosts keep waking you up!\n\nThe house is haunted by the ghost of the wife who was married to Harry Lacey in the late 1940's. When he died she decided she didn't want anything to do with him and left his body and the ghost lives in his room in the house.\n\nWhen you step through the living room door, you feel the presence of the ghost behind you. The ghost always wants something or people who were with the deceased. It also never moves but looks at you with sad eyes.\n\nWhen the ghost walks through the house, it stops at random. As it does, the doors lock, the blinds come open, the refrigerator starts moving around, and the doorbell keeps ringing. Also when the ghost stops, the door unlocks. However there is one thing it won't do. It won't open.\n\nAt night.............. when the door opens.......... you suddenly hear a creak........., and then silence.............. then silence again...\n\nYou are supposed to make the ghosts stay away........ but.......,... as you walk further past the house................... you get stronger, then weaker......., and finally completely paralyzed..............................\n\nIf this house is haunted by an actual person (not a computer game or other computer generated object) then the answer is \" The Phantom of the Pulsar House.\"\n\nThis house has been featured in over twenty-five of the most popular horror movies.\n\nOn March 23, 1981, the famous director John Carpenter recorded what is possibly the scariest, longest, and most elaborate haunted house ever filmed. He had one of the most experienced film crew members and the most experienced cinematographer working for him to help. They had to shoot this entire house in one night. John Carpenter gave these guys enough of a deadline to help them shoot efficiently, not because they needed to be done before anyone left.\n\nThe actors were on set after two weeks so they could practice doing lines with John Carpenter. The only time that they actually left was for a lunch break...................\n\nAt 2:40 p.m. they started to shoot the scene with the ghost and the ghost's girlfriend..... the ghosts had been waiting for this scene..... for days........... (you can tell because the house is so large and the ghosts moved everywhere.). It also was the first day on which the camera was synchronized and the actors could hear it.\n\nAs soon as they started filming........... they started hearing the movie actors as they walked around on set.... (The characters are in the old barnyard.) As they saw the characters they moved from area to area............................................\n\nThe movie camera crew was so focused on the performance of the actors...... that they didn't notice anything........................................................\n\nAs soon as the movie crew left the set............... then.... the ghosts moved........

{"id":2887,"ended":false,"length":638,"gen_text":"Are you thick skinned? Are you kind of an ass? Post a great story here then come back later and rewrite someone else's story to make it better.\n\nI want to say something here to those people that think that we're posting these because we have nothing better to do on the day and we want to keep everyone busy. I'm not a part of the team that does the 'fantasy football draft' right now and I wasn't aware when the guys over at 'The Red and the Black' were going to post a story on it, but I'm going to do my best to keep it interesting and try to answer your questions.\n\nI don't know why I thought it was okay to post the news with a picture of myself on it, but that's what we did. As a matter of fact, I'm the only one who really edited it. The editor didn't like it but I really hope some of your viewers did. We will get it to you eventually. We promise!\n\nWhat's up everyone? This is a very important post. We have a very important date for a game we're holding on October 9. You should definitely know about this because this is the official kickoff for the game. We have 4 teams playing ( A team named 'The Red Devils' from the UK which will be playing against 4 teams from 'The Green Dragons' from Australia. We have an international group of 3 teams. This is the game we're hosting the 3rd match of this world cup, and that's what you're all here for! We hope to have this one finished by November 9 and then move into our 4th world cup game which is taking place from November 8 to November 10.\n\nThis is a group photo I took with everyone at my place a little while ago. I hope you didn't notice that I have my phone on my right hand side.\n\nIf this game is anything like World Cup '09 I'm sure you guys will love it. There's a big chance you'll actually meet some guys you won't see for a while. I'll have more details about this game here. We are one of the 2 teams taking part in the next round so we might make some exciting matches. We won't be able to play as many matches as we did in 2007 but I think it'll be good for everyone who isn't living in the US or doesn't have access to pay TV to get to see some real football. Even if we don't win it's cool, it means something happened.\n\nFor people who are joining us who haven't watched the previous games, it's always best to have a look at 'Red Devil Nation'before you decide to pay money to a channel that broadcasts only one game at a time. There is also a lot of other great sites on the internet that will show you real football. A quick search on YouTube will uncover plenty of the best clips from that era.\n\nWe will have more info about this game in the near future but since I have a schedule I'll post it for you right now.\n\nThanks again for watching and thanks for all of your support so far.

Your character is different from your own reality. This is why characters who are the same as you are not always believable. If your character is always at home and in his place, it can be difficult to believe that he\/she can even walk around the world and reach a different place. Similarly, when you imagine your characters as someone else, then you can't expect them to walk on the snow, live in the jungle, walk on water and even have the knowledge of their surroundings.\n\nThis is why characters who are the same as you are not always believable.

Similarly, when you imagine your characters as someone else, then you can't expect them to walk on the snow, live in the jungle, walk on water and even have the knowledge of their surroundings. Your characters should have their own motivation. The author does not write only for the reader's pleasure. He\/she wants to write on the subject of his\/her story to gain insight into the real people in his\/her book. Therefore, writing characters, even those in your own reality, must not be motivated solely for the pleasure of reading. What does a character who is motivated for good really want? Is she\/he only trying for fame and fortune? Is he\/she always trying for a better life? Maybe the character also loves the people of his\/her world? This will serve to enhance your reader's understanding of your characters.\n\nIn the end, it is no good writing a character who is exactly like you. The reader might be confused by the lack of details, or be irritated because their favorite character's life is completely different from theirs. On the other hand, if you have a character whose story seems different from your life, then it is much more believable and your readers will think that the author has written your life because they are already convinced by your characters.\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":675,"entropy":[6.752,1.252,5.8754,5.5635,0.0327,11.2559,7.3978,0.0345,1.226,5.1635,4.4772,6.1252,2.1383,7.4267,1.0677,9.486,0.857,1.4447,0.2309,0.001,1.4405,2.7587,1.0178,3.2562,3.2541,1.8384,0.8812,2.2729,2.816,6.0098,1.9017,4.8008,1.3196,2.629,0.1072,0.1069,0.4718,1.9006,5.9182,2.5211,1.6912,4.8761,2.2243,1.7788,3.1313,1.1798,5.9898,5.0099,2.9843,2.6628,3.3088,6.3499,3.7681,2.8231,2.1025,2.8517,0.8604,4.1728,2.3965,1.6875,1.9749,0.5931,2.0497,2.7923,6.3352,2.9656,2.1835,1.1392,0.382,1.4516,0.0295,7.8618,3.782,0.3923,0.3674,0.0431,0.0072,0.0033,0.0029,0.0001,0.0035,0.0024,0.0003,0.0026,0.0017,0.0013,0.0019,0.0023,0.0019,0.0015,0.0017,0.0052,0.001,0.0017,0.0013,0.0011,0.0007,0.0006,0.0009,0.0009,0.0019,0.0018,0.0005,0.0011,0.0004,0.0008,0.0024,0.0003,0.0024,0.0007,0.001,0.0015,0.0021,0.0013,0.0003,0.0008,0.001,0.0036,0.0025,0.0012,0.0009,0.0007,0.002,0.0014,0.0004,0.0013,0.015,0.0006,0.0007,0.0004,0.0007,0.001,3.5995,0.8976,1.1132,1.8314,2.626,0.1401,0.9259,4.302,6.5092,2.795,3.895,0.5978,5.7306,2.0565,1.203,5.3971,0.8791,1.8138,0.9663,0.1013,0.0019,2.7771,0.8043,6.1006,1.3091,3.5514,0.6735,3.2877,3.5008,0.0718,0.3789,5.3776,0.7834,1.8307,6.2588,0.9835,2.1958,0.0002,4.0281,0.7379,0.0096,0.0008,0.0005,0.0006,0.0008,0.0011,0.0011,0.004,0.0004,0.001,0.0015,0.0003,0.0003,0.0004,0.0009,0.0016,0.0007,0.0004,0.0011,0.0014,0.0024,0.0006,0.0013,0.0004,0.0002,0.0016,0.0034,0.0007,2.0216,2.158,0.7049,1.9486,3.9122,1.3164,1.0012,1.4898,2.5723,0.5197,0.9888,3.9062,0.7055,3.8148,4.8103,2.8996,1.1086,3.7602,0.5996,1.8785,1.1167,3.583,2.8203,0.431,3.2997,3.3546,2.1561,3.071,0.0585,3.6359,5.6692,2.6316,4.6555,1.8805,0.5357,1.1451,0.0002,3.3947,0.0594,0.001,0.0015,0.001,0.001,0.0005,0.0017,0.0002,0.0008,0.0008,0.0002,0.0001,0.0006,0.0034,0.0012,0.0203,0.0005,0.0007,0.0234,0.0005,0.0003,0.0007,0.001,0.0008,1.6275,1.2806,0.7905,4.6014,0.394,2.3056,0.9142,5.3533,0.1257,2.8893,0.8433,3.8488,4.5375,3.501,0.9433,3.694,0.3515,0.7471,0.8289,1.4484,1.3702,4.7129,1.9838,0.1872,3.4566,1.1884,0.5684,0.5068,5.8183,5.2224,1.6375,1.7657,3.6412,1.7391,6.2454,0.3885,2.1853,3.5176,0.5261,2.0534,0.3131,0.9797,0.9498,0.3003,0.7409,0.0037,3.1309,6.1138,3.2222,2.5215,1.1468,0.9732,3.0327,5.6306,2.1844,1.8802,0.8339,0.6805,5.5698,0.057,4.31,1.7977,5.0413,1.3922,2.4623,2.0257,4.0593,0.8802,0.2306,3.796,1.464,2.3502,1.8608,2.8223,0.7138,0.0117,3.9922,3.1295,0.7725,5.9044,1.9077,5.1012,0.3319,1.4482,2.2216,0.6162,5.3364,1.2417,1.7262,1.9026,3.3629,3.1264,2.424,4.6197,0.3269,4.4729,4.8766,0.1403,0.5823,0.0002,1.869,0.1805,0.0245,0.029,0.0006,0.0013,0.0018,0.0005,0.0003,0.0006,0.0011,0.0029,0.0004,0.0002,0.001,0.0025,0.0005,0.0002,0.0007,0.0015,0.0007,0.0,0.001,0.0005,0.0008,0.0002,0.0006,0.0012,0.0007,0.0006,0.0002,0.0005,0.0005,0.0005,0.001,0.0004,0.0005,0.0019,0.0002,0.0001,0.0004,0.001,0.0005,0.001,0.0005,0.0008,0.0005,0.0001,0.0009,0.0261,0.0004,0.0008,0.0007,0.0026,0.0003,0.0002,0.0003,0.0006,0.0005,0.0006,0.0011,0.0008,0.001,0.0001,0.0006,0.0013,0.0011,0.0002,0.0004,0.0013,0.0007,0.0004,0.0005,0.0019,0.001,0.0005,0.0005,0.0001,0.0004,0.0002,0.0011,0.0006,0.0006,0.0007,0.0002,0.0003,0.0002,0.0003,0.0009,0.6931,1.6321,4.052,1.8311,2.5513,0.0941,4.0282,0.621,2.8274,2.7468,3.3496,0.0796,2.521,3.5076,0.9383,0.6325,2.3097,1.2579,1.5591,0.3315,1.5337,0.1521,0.0371,2.3017,0.3716,2.1125,6.5551,1.5723,3.3064,1.2886,1.1388,0.0589,0.0053,4.6607,3.8402,4.6841,2.696,1.2584,0.8712,3.8222,3.9774,3.1816,1.2358,0.0842,0.0048,5.5845,0.1117,2.8017,0.1441,5.8868,2.3087,5.358,3.3587,3.8262,3.1673,1.19,0.814,1.4339,0.111,2.7319,4.8076,0.8964,2.8624,1.9509,2.2785,0.4294,2.3344,0.1399,2.5961,0.6786,5.7336,3.7168,2.806,1.0486,4.8388,1.2558,1.486,2.4026,5.5065,5.6168,1.5535,0.278,3.3368,3.5556,0.8598,0.0039,4.0314,2.6894,4.9058,3.1367,1.2188,0.5329,0.2585,1.7223,0.4978,0.046,0.0035,3.8537,1.5116,4.37,1.9622,1.491,0.7496,0.4734,4.8158,2.0088,1.0954,5.1562,3.947,2.0878,2.2491,3.2247,0.9902,0.1249,0.0024,1.4409,1.8226,3.8895,2.5864,6.1031,2.2254,3.4014,1.8769,3.0028,0.0507,1.6744,0.3244,1.7669,1.4122,0.4638,0.3626,0.0002,4.4228,2.0125,1.1251,0.0777,2.4373,0.3125,6.2529,2.6271,3.7251,0.9614,1.9238,1.1312,0.5432,4.7526,0.2633,0.2535,0.7384,2.6895,1.7546,3.7847,2.6224,2.2561,2.3969,1.0183,2.514,0.0038,3.548,1.8456,2.6309,3.6211,4.2025,3.0306,4.7619,2.0811,0.3059,4.4,2.1893,0.7377,3.5208,0.2249,0.2549,1.7445,0.0508,5.2609,0.0615,0.0919,0.0205,0.0074,1.4842,0.7423,2.6921,1.3496,0.9661,3.6331,4.2726,4.7758,4.2343,0.3056,0.75,3.427,0.1977,1.0544,1.9714,1.2912,2.8137,0.9778,0.9143,2.3258,4.6963,0.9575,0.2491,5.0988,0.7114,2.1981,0.7773,1.2531,3.1299,3.1246,1.0762,5.0076,2.2425,1.9137,5.8627,3.7145,2.7281,0.813,1.8798,0.2566,0.5295,0.0002,4.3954]}
{"id":1376,"ended":true,"length":645,"gen_text":"Write a resurrection story where God has promised people eternal life in spite of everything. Say that there is a heaven where everyone goes to for eternity. Say there is a hell where everyone goes to in the next life. If everything goes perfectly, then there is no God.\n\nThat's not all. As soon as the book is finished, your readers are going to have to accept that you have told them that there were no Jews or Christians who believed that Jesus was God. That's a fact. You can't pretend that it isn't.\n\nIn any case, as the second book starts, the book will be pretty heavy going. I'm currently writing 20 chapters, more or less, a day. You probably won't like this part, because I'm going to use Jesus's parents as an example of Christian hypocrisy. They don't believe there is a Son of God, nor do they believe Jesus is God. But they won't say that because it turns the other way.\n\nBut when the book is finished, some of my own views will be quoted, and I hope your readers will get the joke.\n\nQ: Some Christians say that all religions are wrong. Do you share their views?\n\nA: No. Religion can be useful, but it can go both ways: If religion is really true, there will always be good in it. If it is really false as they say, nothing can stop it. What will kill you and me is not a little religion, but an eternal eternal religion.\n\nWe have a choice. If it is true you have a brother in Christ Jesus, but if it is false you have no brother in Christ Jesus, what will kill us? If we believe in the truth of religion, that we have a brother in Christ Jesus, then we will never be alone.\n\nQ: Do you have religion in your heart?\n\nA: I am still an atheist, but I have faith in God. I want to believe in God until I see Him.\n\nQ: So you don't believe in any form of divine law?\n\nA: No, not really. I guess you could call us agnostic. But I wouldn't put that word in front of my name. I'm sure we will come up with something better.\n\nQ: What do you think about the evolution theory?\n\nA: That's an odd name for a theory. It sounds like something straight out of the Star Trek episode \"Where No Man Has Gone Before.\" How can a theory explain our existence? One of my favorite scientists is a Christian, but he's a Christian who accepts the theory that there was once a God, and now he's not there.\n\nI have a friend who is a scientist, and he told me that no scientific theory explains everything in a way no human beings could ever imagine. This is one of the problems with religion. It doesn't help us find answers either, for I don't believe there is a God.\n\nQ: Would you like to marry a Christian?\n\nA: God knows I'm not interested in that kind of thing. I am married to God -- not a man or a politician or a movie actress. I will be happy in my old age, I am sure of that.","token_len":675,"entropy":[3.5497,13.2823,2.0425,4.1247,5.7447,3.6975,5.5062,4.8362,1.4853,0.0741,2.0733,4.0942,0.0027,4.5457,2.1899,5.6855,0.9671,3.8682,0.8394,0.9442,3.9138,1.5231,2.1704,3.1841,0.9378,3.8732,0.7764,0.897,2.1739,2.7859,0.4241,0.2207,0.3401,0.5009,1.1611,0.1671,0.1844,5.467,1.9113,2.5766,0.0919,0.3015,3.557,6.3983,2.0043,3.3053,0.4733,2.3787,2.998,1.031,0.5401,5.3829,0.7869,1.9107,0.0132,4.2027,0.979,2.031,4.9402,0.6879,5.0125,3.11,0.0038,2.4518,4.7714,0.9248,1.8665,0.213,5.3213,2.6104,2.2736,0.3165,0.0029,3.2228,1.0407,3.5785,0.7949,2.5287,1.8344,4.7688,0.9885,1.1664,1.8242,6.2147,1.7267,3.6689,2.302,0.3436,3.6256,1.7691,2.1837,0.911,0.4426,1.4762,0.5879,2.4155,1.0405,1.9423,3.5871,0.6278,2.3757,1.7433,0.2651,3.6236,0.7845,1.3855,2.0139,0.0003,0.783,1.0746,0.0001,3.9452,4.6325,0.4716,0.0263,4.6062,3.2805,5.8253,2.1279,5.4109,0.5128,1.7571,3.1532,2.9197,1.2547,5.9244,5.3047,5.3708,0.4975,2.4484,1.838,5.915,1.5452,6.2154,2.901,1.8994,6.3843,0.7306,0.0006,0.9826,3.6939,1.3428,0.3254,4.4025,4.7678,1.1281,0.0004,2.6539,4.05,2.2231,1.6793,2.7393,1.986,0.7378,1.1421,0.0669,4.903,4.6308,2.6042,5.9532,0.7139,1.9795,0.4811,0.4241,5.8302,1.1918,0.4118,3.1279,3.6725,0.0005,0.883,6.5671,0.5352,0.2443,6.1292,0.1517,0.0143,0.8833,4.7205,0.3387,0.0545,0.5894,2.1184,0.9794,0.4011,0.271,2.6039,0.8349,5.7318,0.0022,2.6346,1.4601,3.3268,1.5158,6.7805,2.9532,3.338,0.9098,2.1043,1.1686,0.0002,3.8921,4.0968,1.7263,0.9832,0.2823,0.7288,0.1921,5.5665,0.9305,2.7599,5.9279,3.9055,1.1734,0.5259,4.9692,1.5616,0.8797,1.6674,2.2923,4.9934,0.1656,0.1401,3.8029,1.2051,4.3482,0.2165,1.3143,0.0002,3.7855,0.7123,4.9094,1.9887,1.6945,0.561,4.7598,2.5846,0.6425,2.7706,0.8915,2.3996,0.045,4.1826,1.7021,1.7859,0.1091,0.1803,0.0002,0.2221,0.0045,1.967,0.7239,4.8319,4.1172,0.6135,2.8702,1.4401,1.1393,0.8414,1.0628,6.2229,3.5288,0.0176,3.8802,3.2996,3.2431,0.8027,4.8745,2.029,0.1255,3.8303,2.0845,2.3622,0.0109,2.0468,3.1925,0.2953,0.5307,1.6098,1.1628,1.3657,1.9529,0.2762,9.9537,1.9414,0.6094,0.083,5.7996,3.1788,3.4663,1.3043,0.6808,5.1877,3.5764,6.097,4.3763,3.8635,1.0956,0.7525,1.5063,2.3557,3.6866,3.0281,0.8054,0.2636,3.0812,5.1116,6.2241,2.5166,0.2289,0.6943,0.0002,4.9628,2.1384,2.2875,2.7175,1.0621,2.2877,4.0421,1.0612,0.2869,6.4317,2.375,1.3545,4.3073,2.4298,1.9295,2.8307,0.2793,5.0354,1.6245,0.1389,0.3191,0.7881,1.5176,0.9119,1.7181,0.2017,0.578,0.023,0.32,0.0981,2.2736,1.3148,2.0265,3.0828,0.6171,2.9991,2.345,2.0083,1.176,1.7606,2.8324,0.6096,2.3047,0.2085,3.5936,1.7973,1.059,0.3144,0.266,0.0938,0.0623,0.2411,0.1577,1.4418,0.5543,1.6754,3.2387,1.2505,3.6848,0.3225,1.5123,0.0002,0.9489,0.0046,2.3151,0.0514,2.3438,6.8822,0.7334,0.9845,2.8235,0.2033,0.1676,0.0002,0.0073,0.0022,1.5002,3.2426,4.8642,2.7489,0.5711,1.0905,0.6496,0.5006,1.9667,4.0311,0.8398,0.9619,0.4647,1.1016,4.8211,0.3206,1.0505,0.7571,0.6469,6.8095,0.6953,4.2048,3.5191,1.1531,1.4583,0.0002,0.3051,0.0031,4.6148,1.1874,1.9473,0.0006,0.9059,0.1371,3.2574,4.638,0.0053,5.4175,5.7008,0.3405,0.0576,0.0002,0.0041,0.0018,0.5983,1.1074,2.364,2.5152,0.0451,0.9751,5.5519,1.9514,0.3443,0.8279,5.5838,1.874,1.484,1.049,2.6499,1.4941,4.0862,0.0005,4.3392,1.9059,1.3093,1.2189,1.5876,0.0052,2.5794,0.1728,0.351,1.4837,2.2108,4.1175,3.3954,2.4685,2.9754,1.4922,0.1121,1.2844,2.1442,0.4396,0.3083,0.0002,0.1587,0.0029,1.686,1.6402,0.0521,0.649,1.2245,1.0701,4.8971,2.5695,0.2664,0.1196,0.0001,0.0053,0.0019,3.43,0.4851,3.1346,6.0144,5.0853,0.4292,0.6066,0.1528,0.3469,2.1041,1.7447,0.5398,1.7566,5.8998,0.1441,0.0046,1.649,5.8612,0.3809,1.6946,0.7205,1.597,0.0153,0.1873,0.0054,0.0012,0.0027,0.3552,5.2341,1.1366,2.2563,0.5269,2.4163,6.2182,0.8024,0.6064,6.082,1.8165,2.1778,1.2452,1.9193,1.3605,2.953,2.4131,1.0814,1.8342,0.4586,3.2085,1.9518,2.6221,0.5952,4.0855,1.8366,0.8563,3.1424,2.6993,2.5907,2.7871,0.9568,3.2111,1.8404,0.8686,2.8476,2.4359,1.0805,3.5961,0.9032,0.7387,1.212,0.0002,1.9137,3.2712,1.6689,2.4164,0.2209,1.1528,0.7536,2.263,1.461,0.7293,0.3857,3.1521,0.021,0.8841,5.3909,3.7907,0.2673,3.1153,1.2219,4.222,3.2061,1.5517,5.553,2.2333,5.017,1.4884,1.598,2.0109,0.0906,4.6464,0.9427,3.7107,0.2879,0.2457,3.3458,0.4379,1.9355,0.7108,1.5902,2.7923,0.0004,4.4457,0.8437,3.1978,1.9716,5.8678,2.1139,3.9709,4.8442,1.8593,0.0006,1.2332,1.7755,0.3057,0.9743,0.3108,0.4359,0.6352,0.0002,0.2761,0.0028,4.3325,0.0789,1.5944,0.0655,4.5915,1.2278,1.9159,0.1336,0.0403,0.0002,0.0064,0.0018,5.4295,2.1896,1.5523,2.4925,0.9808,2.2793,0.5658,1.7148,3.2487,0.0014,0.6943,0.1433,1.3032,3.5932,3.2866,0.2596,2.8372,7.0631,2.8203,2.3075,2.3795,2.0491,0.2273,8.7773,0.8719,0.3979,3.5131,5.6967,0.7408,1.0968,5.4894,2.0973,1.4881,2.8798,1.4622,3.8295,0.013,2.4887,4.523,2.8406,0.4081,1.4745,0.7058,0.1891]}
{"id":3196,"ended":false,"length":626,"gen_text":"Write a story about the value of a single human life... about one in 100 million people killed by war, famine, disease and discrimination.\"\n\nThe article quotes Dr. Koonin: \"When you think about that in the context of a country of 7 million people, it is a staggering number.\"\n\nThere are no exact figures and the number is just a guess, but it is clear he has a special sensitivity to the human-rights issue.\n\nHe says, \"It is important to bear in mind that people who suffer most from genocide and atrocities are invariably the elderly and the infirm, who do not have the financial means or the skills to do anything about it....\n\n\"There is another aspect to our task here, which is the preservation and development of a people that is vulnerable and struggling desperately and is generally not respected. As part of our research, we are also focusing on how to develop a healthy respect for the elderly, particularly those who live alone, or are in poor health or suffering from other hardships....\n\n\"Another big responsibility of the State is to prevent genocide. No society can survive living in the shadow of one act of genocide, whether against Jews, Christians, blacks, people of different races, or people belonging to 'the lower class' \u2014 any type of human-rights violation is unacceptable.\"\n\nHe is clear that in Bosnia-Herzegovina genocide is the worst human-rights violation \u2014 but it happens in countries all over the world. And when the rights issue is not dealt with, then a society has gone wrong.\n\n\"This problem is not confined to Bosnia,\" Dr. Koonin says. \"It is a problem in all of Yugoslavia and many other countries,\" including Yugoslavia before the war.\n\nHe sees the responsibility of international organizations and countries \u2014 such as the United States \u2014 in this situation and adds, \"You can say that the United States is morally responsible for the fact that people living today are suffering terribly, because of the policies followed at that time.\"\n\nIt would be useful if the United States addressed this issue. The issue is even more important, he says, if one considers that we are all born in one common human family. \"We are all living in this same Earth, with one common fate \u2014 we die and we live,\" he says. Even today we all live in the same world, he adds. \"I am a man of this Earth, living in the same world. What does a man who is on that earthly Earth have to say about how to care for his children after he has died?\"\n\n\"It all boils down to this,\" Dr. Koonin concludes. \"Human rights \u2014 it is for the people living on this Earth.

{"id":1925,"ended":false,"length":651,"gen_text":"The past couple weeks you keep having the same dream : You're lying on a metal table and a light is in your face. A dark silhouette stands above you and you hear `` He isn't ready. Send him back. '' and then you wake up. One day, he says `` He's ready. Pull him out. '' and so i wake up in the ambulance.\n\n\nIt goes something like this : I am in the OR, all alone, the only light is the one in the cage in the hall. I am lying on a bed on the left. There are three dark silhouettes above me, and one is the light.\n\nHe is on the floor, and I can hear him say : `` He has no time for your tricks. Tell him we are ready `` and then all of a sudden I see him. I am so weak but I cry out ` Oh. My God!. Aaaaaah!'' and then all I hear is a kind of clicking sound and then he starts laughing and saying `` Get up, Mr. Lying Figure, Get up!'' and I stand up and he says 'Do you understand?'' and I say ` Yes` and he says `Now go ; you are mine.''.\n\n\nFinally I wake up in the ED, in total darkness, with the light shining on me.\n\n\nIt is after the surgery and he says : `` No pain, no fear, the worst, one hour of all your memories, which will last for the rest of your life. I will do everything to make you forget every detail, until this day. This is the price we have paid for your cooperation.'' At that moment, i can see in his eyes the terror i feel. He takes me in one arm, holds my face in his other hand, and he says `Let's have a break, the light is too bright. '' and he makes a gesture I won't forget.\n\nThe ED doctor is in the middle of the room, with me standing on the bed, in an extremely deep coma. At first we talk about the operation, the complications, the blood loss, the pain, and how this morning he can't even move his mouth due to the pain.\n\nAt last he says : `` We want to pull you out now. Please, we want to get your memory completely back, so we can make sure you won't do it again.''\n\n\nAnd he pulls me out, turns around and he goes back in the operating theatre.\n\n\nIt all just goes on like that. On that same day, I finally woke up, and I can clearly recall all the times he took me, and held onto my hair, and put me down in the cold, cold concrete and then he said goodbye and left.\n\n\nAs he says `Take care, you've got friends everywhere, but the only two that know are all mine anyway.\n\nAnd I know that there was one time in the past when he was alone in the hospital room, and he said that he had to go take a little break, but then he brought me back, brought me back to the operating theatre. This is the man that i love.\n\nHe is my father. It''s time to leave this place. (c) 2001, C.

{"id":1113,"ended":true,"length":624,"gen_text":"We didn't start the fire... but we put it out,\" he said.\n\n\nIt took the group about 15 minutes because of the heat, he said.\n\n\nWhen asked if the group was glad they had saved the family's pets, he replied, \"No. We really lost four dogs [that] we [could have] put to sleep.\"\n\n\nOne dog had to be euthanized because of the severity of the burns, he said.\n\n\nThe owner said he knew the dogs were in the house because the smoke alarm went off when they were outside looking for firewood, but didn't think twice about turning on his own barbecue grill because he was already tired from the long day of work.\n\n\nNo one in the couple's household seemed to realize its smoldering remains were causing a nuisance and safety hazard, said Mike Dearing, of the Fire Department's Ladder Company No. 3, which responded during the fire.\n\n\nWhile crews were making the grills safe for the pets, the owners were not home, said Dearing, who described the owners' home as a \"smallish\" single-family dwelling where they own one dog.\n\n\nThe owner lives \"a long ways away,\" Dearing said, and the couple had been away just \"a couple months.\"\n\n\nDearing said that the fire's origin had not yet been determined, but he could provide no clues about how it started. Fire officials had received several calls about a \"big, hot fire\" in the area on Dec. 19, he said.\n\n\nThe pets' owners, Jeff and Joanne Wilson, said they had gone to the house about a quarter-mile away to get water for their dogs when they saw fire trucks and fire fighters entering the vicinity.\n\n\nThe dogs' owners were not home when firefighters arrived. All three dogs were out at the time and one was in the backyard.\n\n\nAlthough some people complained during the fire that smoke lingered long after the smoke detector had rung, Dearing said they were wrong.\n\n\nThere did not seem to be any condensation on the door handles even as smoke filled the house. Nor were there any long smoldering streaks on the windows or any other noticeable signs that the smoke had a source, he said.\n\n\n\"The only evidence we have -- the smell of fire -- is from the barbecue grill and, honestly speaking, I would say it smells better this way because we used less dry barbecuing fuel,\" Dearing said.\n\n\nThe owners described how they had to take the dogs down to the fire department to be treated. Joanne Wilson's husband brought his girlfriend who also lives there and three of the four dogs got medical attention \"within minutes,\" her husband said. \"Four dogs did not make the hospital, but that's all part of the process,\" he added.\n\n\nWhen the fire was under control, firefighters told the Wilson family that because their house was built on an urbanized soil, no smoke detectors could be found in the home.\n\n\nThe owner is considering getting one of those \"smart smoke\" detectors from the Westboro Baptist Church that were developed to help reduce the number of fires in homes where there is an absence of any electronic smoke detectors. She believes she'll get one next year, her husband added.","token_len":679,"entropy":[5.0812,0.0009,5.1434,2.5289,3.4208,6.4307,2.6165,0.9319,4.2124,0.5777,0.0948,1.9788,1.5875,0.5303,0.2849,3.5752,0.0002,4.7332,2.4725,2.7909,5.4024,2.0481,3.1126,0.0777,8.6077,2.2902,0.377,2.9341,1.1411,1.5238,0.1809,0.1245,0.4543,0.0002,4.3818,2.7756,0.8973,1.8152,2.0088,1.5874,5.0828,1.3371,2.1939,3.0495,0.4286,4.5689,1.1146,3.6171,0.1707,2.0104,2.1857,0.6567,0.0116,2.4139,1.6386,1.2695,4.7962,6.2661,4.9328,2.007,6.3233,2.7762,0.8249,1.3114,6.1646,2.268,1.3743,0.0674,3.8416,1.9546,0.094,0.914,0.2431,0.0002,4.8493,2.5091,2.8007,0.7897,0.0893,0.5457,0.0002,0.009,1.1405,1.0416,1.6839,1.3439,0.0072,1.0367,0.7089,0.6676,0.8016,0.1186,0.0673,0.2357,0.0002,1.5799,4.2323,3.0541,1.6509,5.4444,1.1523,2.7276,1.0416,1.6929,0.5926,1.6424,1.7315,2.0009,3.2862,1.2137,1.3804,0.0025,2.1524,1.3302,1.758,1.875,6.8715,0.2434,2.7713,0.0178,1.777,2.1887,2.3877,0.0005,1.6193,5.5678,0.2225,5.2947,2.575,3.2644,2.9516,5.9701,0.7587,3.4491,0.9543,1.4274,4.8497,5.4286,1.0203,1.22,2.5745,0.809,1.9274,1.3775,0.1949,0.1487,0.0002,5.5013,0.6476,2.5176,0.084,5.8017,0.0196,2.8941,5.5723,0.2474,2.8004,7.6193,5.8644,0.1799,0.0003,2.7517,0.7407,4.0993,1.8563,2.5987,3.6807,4.8136,0.5308,0.9814,2.4942,5.7758,4.7826,5.1267,0.1087,4.2636,0.7258,4.3758,1.2668,0.4411,5.1372,0.0005,2.7925,3.4957,0.0058,2.3957,2.1273,0.8503,0.5008,6.9039,0.1472,1.6857,0.19,0.1394,0.0003,5.1913,4.1968,0.9983,4.4996,2.3579,4.7157,1.3366,1.2706,1.5683,1.0964,1.7186,0.3514,1.4213,2.8262,1.2533,4.7003,2.387,1.1187,3.2301,0.6786,0.0017,1.1126,0.4655,4.2962,0.2343,3.0698,2.649,2.2227,0.0695,1.241,0.9117,4.5272,3.1772,1.4935,3.2919,0.0756,0.921,1.8587,5.6982,3.3974,4.7139,4.1449,1.3536,1.0328,0.1847,0.0003,1.4006,2.5857,5.0423,5.3521,2.5115,3.3217,1.5231,1.0616,0.9571,1.1338,0.0004,0.0664,1.0286,1.6878,1.7552,1.5006,2.1283,2.1376,2.8191,5.5554,4.107,0.5594,0.7843,4.3145,0.7115,0.1927,0.0003,2.3761,0.0128,0.3648,2.9105,2.4399,2.1737,3.7884,2.905,4.29,1.34,1.5012,0.0037,0.1293,1.0182,0.4382,2.2258,4.5819,6.4072,0.4924,3.8317,1.9808,2.2334,0.7143,0.486,0.2956,4.5401,1.8811,2.6774,3.9988,2.7871,0.4034,0.8525,1.4239,2.627,3.985,2.1554,4.1135,1.2768,0.2189,1.0692,0.1179,0.5568,3.0257,4.9638,0.0031,3.308,0.4929,1.5991,0.0664,0.1911,0.2042,0.0003,1.5903,5.9507,1.2926,0.8748,2.3275,6.0534,0.3533,5.1574,0.7305,5.433,0.2209,2.7025,0.4645,1.6593,4.0993,0.7234,1.4609,2.5348,2.5849,3.5205,3.6522,0.4714,0.1049,0.6654,1.2438,2.2913,4.1949,1.0583,0.536,1.6314,1.9849,0.5572,1.691,4.0891,1.9197,0.9694,2.0568,2.2923,5.5368,0.3925,6.4043,0.4281,0.3709,0.0003,1.8787,3.2084,1.9039,0.9645,2.1398,1.9054,0.4594,1.2646,1.7547,0.3543,2.1311,6.048,2.1777,1.276,0.7218,5.1989,2.7319,0.1456,0.0567,2.6798,4.5416,1.1468,1.8578,0.632,0.9573,1.8029,0.5713,0.0003,5.9569,4.8796,3.0397,4.3249,5.374,0.2229,0.8691,1.2643,4.1718,6.157,0.0056,3.9244,0.1152,0.5461,2.9691,2.7487,1.1085,4.5895,0.0297,0.3983,0.9479,0.0004,0.0981,4.7931,1.4702,4.4634,0.3508,0.4108,0.0003,5.6862,6.0788,0.1478,0.7731,0.0066,0.0102,0.4783,5.6576,0.0578,0.6161,0.1207,5.448,3.2598,7.0143,3.3386,3.8346,1.6452,0.049,0.6075,2.1262,6.28,1.79,0.6331,0.1937,5.6449,3.2719,0.5037,0.0039,3.1752,0.7697,0.1117,3.1973,2.0516,4.1533,2.4948,3.9047,1.2463,1.4824,0.8186,2.4524,1.1618,5.3576,2.162,1.3176,0.2563,0.0348,0.0087,0.15,0.0003,2.0255,2.0231,2.474,3.9946,1.6421,1.2675,6.738,1.9,2.3628,1.5728,4.4124,0.3349,0.9428,2.3646,0.4148,3.259,0.4883,3.337,5.8569,5.1699,6.8476,0.0372,2.0869,2.9484,2.2186,1.0078,3.0728,1.7655,4.9592,0.4211,4.3255,2.4836,4.6739,2.5976,6.6443,6.4137,2.3196,1.0519,0.3721,0.363,0.6157,0.0005,0.0179,0.0385,0.2585,0.0002,1.3759,2.6251,5.577,3.373,1.0453,1.3446,3.5284,4.0529,0.9166,0.6983,4.9866,0.983,0.3041,1.4939,1.2259,1.7857,1.0064,0.566,1.4275,4.4947,0.0057,0.0726,3.7404,1.4839,6.4965,2.6518,5.8044,4.157,2.4946,0.9269,3.0927,2.048,4.6227,1.5514,0.6327,2.3031,0.1743,4.7201,3.3141,0.4163,6.6245,2.5329,2.0309,1.1336,4.9469,0.066,0.1056,0.052,4.3946,5.8963,1.312,5.2725,0.2799,1.3806,3.5436,4.3201,3.2297,0.9019,4.0052,0.5156,3.3519,4.1643,0.0133,0.3926,1.5008,1.1804,0.344,2.0108,0.0302,0.1077,0.0003,4.5077,1.7315,2.3919,1.1168,1.7513,0.0048,0.3331,2.0945,5.0493,0.2703,1.5425,0.9633,1.2646,4.5961,2.6806,1.7508,0.6349,3.2919,0.8443,2.893,5.8708,2.506,6.231,0.6806,4.9493,5.7941,0.5624,4.1155,0.389,3.4704,1.0885,0.2962,1.5317,0.5208,0.7767,0.0003,1.4555,3.4378,4.5466,2.4771,3.2419,3.1038,1.3055,1.4864,3.7428,1.4271,0.8849,1.8469,0.5762,3.7829,1.1758,6.3952,4.0476,0.1517,0.0182,3.212,3.8455,5.701,1.3323,2.0615,4.9036,1.2349,1.9357,0.0061,1.1199,1.2137,2.0655,3.6071,1.7115,1.2282,2.8324,2.8047,0.0134,5.3389,4.8457,1.1087,0.442,0.856,6.4244,5.0472,2.577,3.6073,3.1201,0.7555,4.1835,1.9812,1.0815,2.2647,0.0049,3.5208,0.0267]}
{"id":1399,"ended":true,"length":641,"gen_text":"You belong to the 1 % of humanity with superhuman abilities. But powers are never straightforward. For example, your best friend is pyrokinetic - but whenever she used her abilities, she's left with burns that vary in severity. Your powers, however, are a whole new level of complicated. You've been in control of almost anything except your body. You're constantly learning new skills and techniques, all related to your powers, and you constantly discover new ways to use them. All this means everything you do is complicated. You've been told that you can't use your powers and that it's not safe to use them.\n\nWhen you were younger, you knew it could be dangerous, but your body hadn' t stopped it. On the other hand, your body doesn 't need to be aware or conscious for it to use your powers. So your body didn 't know it was going to do something dangerous. As a result, your body didn't try to stop it. You've always used your abilities safely. And that's your problem. You're never safe.\n\nBut, you believe that you can change that. You say you have abilities so powerful that you won 't abuse them. You say you want to control them. That's your mission.\n\nBut that's not what you really want.\n\nThat's not what you really want to do, because the fact is, this isn't something you can control. You've been told your whole life that you 'll just have kids, go to college, get a nice job, get married and have a family. At least that's what your teachers always promised you. That's what everyone told you.\n\nBut it can't happen. Nobody knows when you won 't have kids, or how you can stop taking the effects of you, so your immune system turns off. It starts causing problems. That's when all the problems start happening. Suddenly, you've developed allergies and respiratory illness. You cough up blood. Your bones become brittle.\n\nEverything you ever wanted to do, it's been taken from you.\n\nMost of all, you've been abandoned by the people who used to have something to teach you about how your body works. And they've never even said sorry.\n\nWhat if I told you? What if I said, you're going to get back what you were taught. You're going to get your parents who always told you that you would make the world a better place. They're going to care about you. Even if it takes taking care of themselves.\n\nThey 'll take care of you for you. They 'll take care of you. You owe it to them.

{"id":4577,"ended":false,"length":634,"gen_text":"As magic returns to the world, purchasable drinks actually start having magical effects. Energy colas actually imbue you with energy. Diet drinks actually cause noticeable weight loss. Vitamin drinks heal injuries and disease, and so on.\n\nHowever, that idea is almost universally opposed to, and the public at large refuses to consider it.\n\nMagic drinks also allow you to make a 'wish'. This is a power that comes into play when you drink magic drink.\n\nA few wishes allow you to make yourself invisible or to see other people, and most of these have a very short life span. A few others actually grant the wish itself, such as one that gives you the ability to breathe underwater.\n\nA wish allows you to change the flow of time, to alter the weather, or to change what happens to you or your body. For example, a wish that turns yourself into a ghost allows you to stay alive for as long as an hour, can't change your form or move away, and can only be used on others, never yourself.\n\nBut the most interesting part of a wish is that the other person who possesses the wish doesn't have to be present for it to come to fruition. You can have a wish come true from a distance, through the use of telepathy or psychometry.\n\nAll of these abilities exist within the world of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and now there's an app for that! 'Wish Manager' gives players the ability to create and manage wishes, and there are some benefits to doing this.\n\nWish Management is a new iOS game from The Witcher Game Studio, and like many recent games, it's free-to-play (and if you buy, then you can play it using in-app purchases).\n\nI picked it up because I enjoyed my time with The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings on PC, but didn't think I'd be able to find another game like it on Android. Wish management for this type of game should be interesting.\n\nWish Manager for iOS features many of the same options as the PC version, though for the most part things work quite differently; here, you have your ability to create wishes.\n\nOnce made, you can save the wishes you make to create lists, and choose to download them to all of your devices. There are three different lists you can import:\n\nWish management isn't the most complex game on the planet. Instead it's a very simple feature, but it works well enough to make the entire experience feel smooth.\n\nAll in all it gives new players a simple, short-term solution to playing The Witcher 3 if they want to play with friends, and if they want to play without having to have the game installed.\n\nWhile it's more of a gimmick right now, it also shows there's enough substance in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to make it worth your time.

{"id":474,"ended":false,"length":555,"gen_text":"A superhero and super villain who both have lame powers, but take each other very seriously.\n\nA comic that has the female lead as the primary hero while the male lead fills in as the secondary hero. Can overlap with Female Protagonist if the protagonist-pilot is male.\n\nThis could also overlap with Weak-Willed Femme Fatale or Inferiority Complex. The opposite can also go on, and the main plotline of this trope is that the male lead has no powers or skills at all that have anything to do with the story, and the female lead is strong and competent with her own powers and skills.\n\nContrast with She Wants to Fight: If any one of the two characters has any kind of fighting skills, then they will either have to rely on some outside force, or are forced into it involuntarily by some other part of the plot.\n\nExamples:\n\nopen\/close all folders\n\nAnime & Manga\n\nComic Books\n\nTintin: In the Tintin \/ B. Bivver comic from the early 1960s, Tintin is the main protagonist, although he is very competent at everything (he's a good pilot, a competent cook, and he's got a great sense of humor). After leaving the adventure comic to focus on writing stories in the magazine, Tintin is found by the British intelligence and decides to go on a world-wide search for the Flying Dutchman. That's when Tintin gets this one too.\n\nIn The Sandman, the series' first major story arc, Morpheus is the sole protagonist, and he only ever develops his abilities for the greater good of his people, a fact which is at the very least somewhat acknowledged. Unfortunately for him, most of the rest of the cast are pretty mediocre at best.\n\nFan Fic\n\nMisfortunes of Moo, where this is the case with The Captain, who is a good Captain, but a terrible pilot.\n\nFilm\n\nLiterature\n\nLive Action TV\n\nMusic\n\nMyths & Religion\n\nPodcasts\n\nIn The Adventure Zone: Balance, every week is a Halloween Special: Ghostface turns up and wreaks all sorts of havoc with his powers and the ghost of a female character named Lark is killed.\n\n. The Powerpuff Girls take this to the extreme. Every episode ends with it's protagonist being forced to face off against a supervillain, who's obviously much stronger.\n\nTabletop Games\n\nTheater\n\nIn The Color Purple (1964), Nannie makes her debut in two performances: one for Zibby, who is the white kid; and one for Eunice, the black one, which both turn out disastrously.\n\nVideo Games\n\nWebcomics\n\nWeb Original\n\nIn a parody of The Big Lebowski, the protagonist, a very inept, understated, low-level superhero-villain, meets a young, brilliant, high-level vigilante, his father, two of his best friends, and a cute black girl. The heroine has to get through them to get to the villain, a black man (who is a superhero-villain). It is a good bit of characterization.\n\nWestern Animation","token_len":683,"entropy":[10.015,4.6438,5.0495,2.1435,4.2301,5.0036,1.912,11.0385,2.6142,1.733,1.6507,6.5866,3.8723,0.1066,3.1722,0.1462,0.4717,1.5413,0.0087,2.7908,4.5049,3.6253,2.7728,3.0473,6.0344,1.2773,2.2422,1.233,4.4088,2.7058,4.2916,0.3333,0.1785,0.5528,6.4427,1.8078,1.7993,0.4856,0.6337,1.0284,0.4851,4.9999,3.317,0.0556,3.8696,1.1002,0.0029,2.5665,0.3865,4.4426,7.0344,5.7825,3.368,0.72,2.8394,0.442,0.5277,0.0002,3.4113,5.3207,0.9018,1.8656,0.0198,5.7873,3.85,0.2682,0.0009,3.9512,0.0285,0.1082,0.0012,3.5839,5.7037,2.024,0.0023,0.5455,0.0292,1.3531,3.7226,3.7368,3.7252,0.6672,4.8288,1.5437,1.4158,3.5546,2.4231,4.2042,6.4672,2.3416,2.0304,2.037,0.6618,1.0527,2.0027,0.6014,2.554,1.7026,2.9233,2.4408,4.2458,2.7862,3.3571,2.6779,0.0138,4.8049,5.5923,2.4248,0.0511,0.0079,0.0038,1.2954,1.9227,1.1163,1.4421,0.9979,0.3049,0.2917,0.8297,5.3759,0.9115,1.7605,3.5716,2.409,0.6675,1.0063,2.1671,0.2485,0.294,0.5847,0.0002,3.2745,0.0043,1.6634,5.5272,3.0817,0.0591,0.6478,0.9857,5.6707,3.8591,7.1799,3.3422,0.3342,0.2376,1.5676,1.4162,2.0392,2.213,3.181,0.0029,2.8464,1.1017,0.5319,2.6978,1.7475,3.4562,4.1129,2.4029,0.5176,2.7116,0.0552,5.5749,3.479,2.2883,2.2945,0.3016,4.7218,2.4226,1.2322,1.5567,7.157,0.0047,1.6094,3.3398,1.2865,4.659,0.0043,0.2575,0.7023,0.2485,0.7261,0.0002,1.1585,0.3349,0.0221,0.0002,0.0095,0.0003,0.0001,0.0003,0.0,0.0006,0.0003,0.3113,0.0009,0.5072,0.0002,0.0007,0.0004,0.1907,0.0393,0.0248,0.0006,0.0003,6.2432,0.5996,0.0003,1.2074,1.7885,1.0438,5.0588,0.0008,0.0036,4.6185,4.0339,0.6677,1.3435,2.3531,5.7067,2.5059,6.4387,1.1443,2.7518,1.8729,0.1659,0.1734,2.1603,0.0004,0.0009,1.528,2.0916,2.3417,2.2547,1.1418,4.582,1.4496,1.6308,3.8882,4.2842,2.2282,3.2228,3.4205,2.507,1.2414,1.2097,3.7782,2.0472,0.3393,1.0486,4.7333,2.783,0.1961,1.2662,3.0302,0.988,3.8502,0.552,2.912,1.0549,0.0145,0.5643,0.3702,4.8578,6.4864,0.8363,4.4395,4.3301,2.4853,2.7129,0.0466,3.1578,3.6102,2.8828,1.7325,3.3344,0.7982,3.0775,0.0002,0.0005,2.535,5.3208,0.6692,1.5764,3.3199,3.3728,2.8413,4.6489,0.0786,2.811,2.4083,0.6179,3.0508,0.8023,0.4429,2.6113,0.3573,1.1506,4.2186,0.4494,0.0277,0.7354,5.7057,1.1576,1.2598,5.0539,0.0014,0.001,2.7941,6.0487,5.5273,5.6675,1.0474,1.9352,0.0002,1.8036,2.5874,1.6097,0.0027,0.4146,1.9785,5.14,0.6094,2.8797,3.6813,1.7401,0.0573,0.4365,1.06,0.0003,0.9177,1.0063,4.8402,2.0827,1.2094,1.5506,1.8072,5.4527,3.4169,6.0171,1.2442,2.5142,4.8238,0.5629,3.1843,0.0435,1.0211,3.2823,1.8291,1.9646,4.7161,3.8693,1.7401,1.6461,5.2412,1.5672,2.8783,1.0697,3.4757,4.3996,1.1704,6.2181,2.3782,0.4382,0.0826,4.3446,0.1657,0.8361,3.8471,0.0025,0.1168,1.1253,1.9927,3.8981,4.6042,1.7093,0.8309,1.305,0.6472,0.0002,1.6411,2.8679,0.0692,0.0008,0.0003,6.5038,2.998,5.3785,0.1595,0.8404,5.7907,4.8126,2.8118,4.0365,4.1938,0.9108,1.1465,2.0891,1.8277,4.3976,5.6213,1.7365,1.7644,1.137,1.5254,4.2955,5.0848,1.0481,0.5105,2.9693,2.6965,1.4563,0.4511,0.7334,0.0002,1.3771,0.221,0.0003,0.414,0.0004,0.0021,0.0002,0.2409,0.4133,0.0129,0.0007,0.0002,1.411,0.0113,0.0003,3.8992,0.0156,0.0213,0.0014,0.0011,0.0003,3.9472,0.3237,0.0099,0.0063,0.0003,1.617,1.5998,0.2251,0.0002,0.0071,0.0071,0.1975,5.8999,4.5167,3.4269,0.8009,5.1734,3.0566,4.4781,6.09,3.4676,5.1512,1.3061,2.3138,3.2261,0.1947,4.3692,0.6517,0.0065,0.2912,3.8489,0.9206,2.8327,2.4786,2.7984,5.9705,1.0352,1.7968,5.6813,3.2161,3.7782,4.7178,3.7555,2.4949,2.9265,1.1232,1.1208,0.0002,11.1063,2.8892,4.9286,0.1323,0.005,5.3416,0.6316,1.0972,1.5207,0.2766,1.462,3.1075,1.4102,3.2587,0.1378,6.3908,2.4021,3.5667,2.3514,3.1775,0.3471,3.7579,1.3538,0.1683,1.1539,2.2282,0.007,0.0005,2.3771,3.0613,2.9765,5.6921,2.8235,0.6753,3.4426,1.2121,0.0002,0.8594,0.0011,0.0262,0.0026,0.0002,1.7747,0.8014,0.0021,0.0003,1.5788,1.806,5.8179,0.0051,3.5462,3.5668,0.2175,4.1259,1.7093,5.7999,1.9681,1.5817,1.5753,6.9063,4.2512,1.8458,1.592,3.6523,6.4027,4.5568,0.2986,1.0761,1.8466,1.2822,2.4175,4.9888,4.8507,3.2193,0.4767,0.4972,0.0421,5.2011,0.7152,0.004,0.0625,1.0241,0.3145,3.1321,3.1646,3.3955,4.7907,3.9669,0.0782,5.6534,0.2457,0.3269,0.8719,0.0002,0.5173,0.0014,0.0075,0.0003,0.509,1.2616,0.0039,0.0088,0.0002,0.4818,0.0926,0.0393,0.0003,2.4394,4.6798,5.2011,0.1575,2.5979,4.2517,0.9771,0.0168,0.0,0.2424,1.9178,2.5813,2.6041,2.7398,5.65,4.1109,3.1869,4.884,7.104,1.6983,5.2742,0.2661,0.8461,5.2905,5.1276,3.1009,0.0031,1.0639,4.8447,0.8945,4.476,2.4101,4.6847,0.7161,2.9433,0.0413,0.655,4.8712,1.8631,6.0566,5.6501,1.2403,6.9548,2.7289,0.1926,2.4787,0.0955,0.353,0.3274,0.9406,5.7395,5.1313,0.6095,1.393,1.6196,5.7311,3.5221,1.7011,4.1246,2.5208,1.6805,2.8147,1.4287,0.3231,0.3976,1.7485,1.4611,3.3443,5.6465,3.3883,4.6937,1.1887,1.4098,2.4862,3.7045,1.9146,0.0771,0.0008,1.9072,3.6703,2.9638,2.4796,3.7355,3.7203,0.4033,5.183,1.6061,0.253,0.0002,1.1517,0.0013]}
{"id":2055,"ended":true,"length":616,"gen_text":"At 30,000 feet, you realize that there is something *wrong* with all the other passengers on the plane. You are going to have to stay calm to not be on the receiving end of a rant because people have to make it from point A to point B.\n\n-5,000 feet -\n\nThis is the most common altitude that people fly on commercial airlines right now.\n\nThe higher the jet flies, the more stressed it is on the pilot and passengers. If the plane gets into situations where things aren't going well, the pilot will often go above 5,000 feet to let the passengers and their systems know that things aren't looking good.\n\nIf a plane goes into a tailspin, for instance, you might see the captain asking the nose gear to be retracted. At five thousand feet, the nose gear will start to drop. The pilot will pull back on the yoke pedal and the nose gear will move forward again. At 10,000 feet, the nose gear will have moved the other three inches forward and the pilot will stop asking for the nose gear to be retracted. This is the point where the pilot can relax and let the passengers know that things are just going to get better. The pilot will want to be near 10,000 feet when the plane can start flying normally again.\n\n-9,000 feet -\n\nWhen the pilot is at 9,000 feet, the plane's nose gear is in a perfect position to start flying again.\n\nThere are times when a pilot will pull the nose gear forward. The reason for this is because when the fuel gauge is at 9,000 feet and the airspeed is over 300 knots, the air is too thin to keep flying. To solve this, the pilot will have the nose gear in a forward position and then try to correct the plane's nose up.\n\nThe nose gear must be ready to jump forward at over 7,000 feet so the jet will start flying correctly. If the pilot pulls the nose gear forward, you know the jet won't work right. If you get pushed to over 9,000 feet because the pilot took your nose gear forward, you have a very good chance of landing right back on the runway.\n\nRemember, you can push the engine up and try to get the nose gear to move backwards and you will just start burning the fuel. If that happened, you'll lose all your runway time and have to climb back.\n\n-9,000 feet plus -\n\nAt high altitudes, the amount of drag on the jet increases. At 9,000 feet, the drag is so high that the plane is slowing down. Usually, this time window ends around 12,000 feet.\n\nSo, the final stages of a flight can take less than seven minutes, which means that passengers won't have to endure more than a minute to take a taxi from the gate to the terminal.\n\n-10,000 feet -\n\nThe final stage of a flight, when you're in for a while-long wait, will take at most two hours (including two minutes for the plane to stop).\n\nSo, it would be perfect for a vacation traveler on a budget to book the flight, take your bags to the gate, and then get to your destination in time to enjoy a relaxing weekend.","token_len":683,"entropy":[7.3877,1.3826,2.6536,0.4185,0.4782,2.8151,5.4218,1.0425,3.1424,1.2547,3.3319,9.4896,1.4635,0.1937,0.3165,5.0419,1.7964,4.3281,3.3073,2.2571,0.6725,0.4327,0.4053,1.8723,2.2447,4.7109,0.1463,1.6152,0.2177,4.9049,2.3108,4.449,3.2533,2.4143,5.27,0.5014,0.9057,0.0021,0.0292,1.591,4.2745,6.7295,4.3222,3.2218,2.1049,3.7651,2.1212,4.6065,2.6471,0.1028,0.0324,0.2807,0.0193,0.9848,1.4506,0.0195,6.8921,5.0972,0.8772,0.1336,0.3537,3.1622,3.3644,0.0002,3.8664,0.255,1.2431,3.5238,3.1353,1.3594,2.6251,2.4812,2.2083,3.0472,2.697,1.5996,6.5802,0.2127,0.2662,3.2692,0.0002,2.6738,5.8119,2.2225,6.6174,1.5301,0.1328,0.0171,0.9964,5.8201,2.8827,0.8774,3.6921,0.4207,2.5405,1.6305,2.3433,0.427,3.6261,1.5056,1.4885,3.5444,2.267,8.1391,0.7755,4.1949,2.2556,0.0007,0.6739,1.1671,0.2658,1.1986,0.6724,1.4556,3.3777,3.7761,3.8986,1.2201,0.0313,0.0022,0.0575,0.9892,3.8164,0.6057,0.2248,2.032,6.0738,4.3731,2.1894,0.6093,1.2288,0.9068,0.0006,4.2823,0.5991,0.2405,0.6718,0.0002,3.2694,3.3213,1.3223,2.4134,2.3776,0.7481,1.904,0.0082,0.6304,4.0836,1.8257,0.0175,3.46,2.2682,0.924,0.683,2.4732,5.6095,0.8874,6.2109,0.6944,0.7458,1.0583,1.6353,1.5151,3.9118,6.175,0.2239,0.0304,0.1898,0.8349,1.1758,0.097,2.3334,4.6659,0.4436,3.5354,2.0164,2.024,1.0269,0.586,3.6048,1.2455,0.3154,0.0339,1.4895,0.0164,6.0863,1.6511,1.0387,0.2172,0.1198,0.1214,4.1504,1.5148,3.0376,0.2555,2.6175,2.6284,0.0356,0.009,0.0267,0.1883,0.2896,0.437,0.0365,0.4169,2.7439,1.7627,4.8797,2.6562,4.8687,0.5837,1.6853,1.2737,0.5639,1.1701,0.1644,3.7854,3.8438,0.9081,0.5072,0.0432,0.0576,0.0263,0.1712,0.0702,0.2541,3.7336,0.5631,2.0374,0.7617,0.4755,1.0074,1.1592,3.0292,2.6938,0.5842,1.506,0.3071,1.4588,1.0549,0.2857,0.4634,0.298,5.2897,0.9051,0.1749,2.0166,0.1375,0.3729,3.9202,1.9051,0.9091,4.374,0.2046,2.8889,5.604,1.9018,0.006,0.0185,0.0768,2.4802,1.3594,0.9016,5.0138,3.3902,2.6295,1.9379,0.1291,0.2095,0.1918,0.0002,1.5408,2.7765,0.0165,0.1592,0.0401,0.2395,0.0211,0.0002,3.6305,1.3663,1.7696,1.7729,1.8577,1.2483,0.0064,0.0011,0.0067,0.2331,1.6846,1.0166,3.5339,3.7925,1.0431,0.8131,3.2225,1.9251,4.8494,0.4918,0.8655,2.5578,0.5388,1.3045,0.1769,1.9136,0.0002,4.6544,0.6007,2.5498,0.5672,1.7894,0.8424,0.8171,3.5676,1.0731,0.5393,0.1485,0.9711,3.9733,2.4188,2.4398,0.6865,0.3613,0.1019,1.8871,3.8114,0.4098,7.0836,2.7012,1.6209,1.4146,2.1096,0.049,0.0238,0.0151,2.5882,0.5343,3.1252,0.1886,0.6419,3.1446,2.3897,0.1498,0.1164,0.3652,2.8256,1.8249,2.8153,0.3099,0.7962,2.9246,3.7856,0.6232,4.4554,4.7346,0.1434,1.0634,0.2295,0.2814,0.3294,5.0311,1.5971,0.1,0.0261,3.5626,0.8459,1.8126,0.2139,2.1006,2.8875,4.5839,0.1045,4.5286,0.4901,1.9685,0.9461,1.9409,2.8193,1.5662,0.9617,0.0002,2.5129,2.074,0.1073,4.6902,0.4467,6.3343,0.3417,5.2712,0.7832,2.0079,6.7001,4.7289,0.2801,0.1887,0.0141,3.4557,1.5645,4.3598,2.3546,2.4966,0.2734,5.1185,0.7459,2.021,0.4283,1.0414,0.9309,0.3589,0.0233,0.2358,0.0829,1.2726,4.0457,3.9417,1.9931,1.8834,2.7558,0.0005,4.7447,1.7294,0.7667,2.7152,1.6397,4.275,6.0629,2.7945,3.6206,0.9526,0.0043,0.0051,0.0462,4.931,0.815,1.2298,6.5404,4.4002,2.9982,0.4387,0.9011,0.1833,0.7688,3.0672,1.7341,3.1057,0.767,0.4377,0.2762,3.5741,4.972,1.8989,1.5958,0.1252,0.5795,0.2978,0.2982,0.0002,5.4119,0.6075,2.6031,2.0791,5.0499,0.9604,6.621,2.8842,2.9748,4.0787,0.1331,2.1166,1.02,0.8708,0.23,1.6388,1.4314,4.6464,3.3146,2.3107,1.3086,3.5614,4.9869,3.4963,3.4209,1.4961,1.1715,2.3125,4.0012,3.9097,0.3419,0.5479,3.2039,4.0181,2.4436,1.4316,5.7665,2.195,0.9073,2.5405,0.1142,4.9978,0.5104,4.8721,0.6951,0.0002,0.7574,3.1504,0.0116,0.5579,0.0865,3.2676,0.2934,0.0125,0.0002,1.924,4.8591,1.55,0.001,0.1292,0.7379,5.3445,0.0118,4.0213,1.8201,0.2631,1.6019,0.8844,0.817,2.2121,1.3169,0.0079,0.0054,0.0641,0.8733,0.5482,1.267,0.6563,2.1175,1.0277,0.2419,0.6012,1.14,1.8557,4.3089,0.1852,1.1085,6.5539,0.4626,2.4328,5.9129,4.5639,3.9036,1.5056,3.3886,0.021,0.1334,0.0154,0.3985,0.8071,0.0002,4.6776,0.8654,2.437,5.7981,5.8748,0.1222,1.5567,1.2196,3.341,2.6597,7.0542,0.3943,5.8799,0.1885,2.37,3.9392,1.5251,1.2093,4.8386,3.7541,0.0007,0.9752,0.4134,3.6354,3.7338,0.0156,1.9183,1.674,3.8929,4.9949,1.9556,4.4564,2.1225,0.621,0.7483,0.1603,0.2779,2.4497,0.2688,0.8206,0.0002,1.8662,1.21,0.0045,0.0057,0.0172,0.1659,0.0125,0.0002,2.2838,2.5274,1.173,0.1759,0.3671,0.1087,4.137,1.9513,1.8917,1.5337,3.1488,5.3438,1.2295,5.9663,5.5905,1.0797,1.8217,0.956,2.5363,2.199,3.4456,3.8219,2.8962,0.817,5.0618,5.4019,5.0947,3.0705,0.7437,1.1707,1.868,0.1023,2.7705,1.2937,0.893,0.0002,3.4239,0.2325,3.8555,3.9254,1.3731,5.4848,1.5288,1.1707,4.6472,6.0788,4.0643,0.5704,2.9414,1.0276,3.0085,3.1678,1.8615,3.7684,3.1959,4.0473,1.7466,2.6011,0.3008,0.8209,0.3673,0.7702,1.0277,2.6139,2.3896,1.2552,1.3094,1.1768,2.7779,1.0484,1.8646,1.3482,2.7047,2.7473,0.6076]}

Merry Christmas humanity! Snow White is our most beloved woman and she has come to our rescue. I knew she has the ability to bring in our nightmare.\n\nSnow White is our most beloved woman and she has come to our rescue. I knew she has the ability to bring in our nightmare. The most terrifying enemy of this game is Death and he seems to exist nowhere in the new world order. As we have discussed above death has no purpose in this game. This is the one thing I would like to remind you of. If death did exist the game would be an easy one. But we will know what to do with Death in the future.\n\nDeath is like our new Santa Claus and he can bring people back to your side, if you are willing to be his toy, just to have someone to play with everyday.\n\nDeath is like our new Santa Claus and he can bring people back to your side, if you are willing to be his toy, just to have someone to play with everyday. The most attractive feature of our new world Order is the fact that the people want to be ruled by force. The most attractive aspect of our game is now that we will be able to control their actions with money. If you don't want to be ruled by force I would suggest that you change your mind. If people want that then they are going to demand that that be the way it is and we will know it next Tuesday. And when the time comes it will be very, very difficult to stop them. If people continue to demand their rights and expect that we will comply with them then we can safely assume that we are being forced into compliance.\n\nIn this sense, the people are our enemies. We will make sure that those whom we intend to rule over will never be free.\n\nIn this sense, the people are our enemies. We will make sure that those whom we intend to rule over will never be free. I believe that when one starts to understand something the only way to do it is by experiencing it with open arms. People do not wish you to know what they are feeling but we were all born and raised in this same world so now we are dealing with that experience, if you want to know it. One of the many things I have to tell you today is that we are going to start releasing some of the new information to new members of this community very soon. I think it is worth mentioning that one of the things that will be available very soon is a group of our most loyal members that will take a very close look at all of these things.

{"id":1092,"ended":true,"length":641,"gen_text":"( WP ) Santa is tired of punishing naughty children with coal. Instead, he decides to resort to vigilante justice.\n\nSanta has a list of naughty children that he wants to deliver to the North Pole because he's pissed that he didn't get anything Christmas.\n\nWhile everyone has their own list of naughty or nice children, Santa is the only one who really cares about the outcome.\n\nThe book is actually titled Santa is Sick of Punishment and he's actually quite literal when he says this.\n\nSanta is the only one who really cares about the outcome.\n\nFor people who don't know, The North Pole is located on top of a mountain, but it's completely accessible from all of North America's land borders because of the Arctic Circle.\n\nHere's the problem: Everyone in the North Pole has naughty or nice kids. But Santa doesn't really care because, well, he never leaves. He's always right there waiting.\n\nBut the kid's who have been naughty are punished with a coal. And the good kids, the good ones who did things right, get a tinseled tree and stuff.\n\nSo, Santa has his minions deliver coal to North Pole, Santa is sick of punishing naughty children with coal and, by extension, the world's poor with the cold and starvation, and the evil tyrants with snow.\n\nThere are a lot of political issues associated with this. The Santa Claus thing got blown out of proportion. The fact is that, like all human beings everywhere, Santa gets bored like all people everywhere, and he wants something else to do.\n\nAnd he just went and did the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do when you're bored with your job.\n\nThere's a real lesson to be had in this story. We're not the only animals. No matter how smart or clever we think we are, we're just dumb slobs. And it's our fault.\n\nBut we never even acknowledge it. And this is an extremely dangerous thing. We need to have a society where, because of our ability to see reality so clearly, the things that are going around the world today make perfectly good sense.\n\nWe need politicians who know what's going on around the world. Who aren't afraid to talk about it. Who are willing to think about it, and act on it.\n\nBecause I really want to live in a world where we all live in harmony with each, and everyone is happy.\n\nAnd not because someone wants to be nice and cuddlier, but because they know that there are really things we should do, things we shouldn't do. Because we'll eventually be bored. And all of these things that we do for pleasure will eventually turn us into monsters.\n\nBecause, one day, life won't have any joy. And then, they'll be right back to dealing with these same idiots who are creating so much misery.\n\nBut by helping to make us aware, they'll realize that their responsibility for this is no longer to have fun, but to help us to have as great a time as possible.\n\nSo, yes, I'm going to ask you to get behind me to see what I'm about to show you. The world needs change.

{"id":3097,"ended":true,"length":661,"gen_text":"Satan and God both occasionally come to Earth in human form, Satan to corrupt souls, God to relax and observe his creation. One day, Satan walks into a pub, and sees God ( in human form ) sitting at the bar. God looks at Satan, slides a beer over to him, and indicates the empty stool to his left. Satan walks to that seat, sits down, and orders a beer.\n\nSatan is now pissed off, and begins attacking God. God has a great poker face, and slowly chips away at Satan, until he is nothing but a pile of ash. God starts dancing around his throne, and the Devil starts getting pissed off, and starts fighting back. At this stage, God and Satan actually start yelling at each other. The world has just been turned upside down.\n\nAt this point the Devil tells God he would rather die for God's sins than go to Hell ; God then takes a drink, and is then swallowed by the fire God placed in front of Satan. Eventually the world is restored to what it was before, and Satan and God are both happy together.\n\nOf course, what will happen after everyone has been returned to a natural state?\n\nFirst, the souls of everyone who died won't go to Heaven. Instead, they will go to a world of pain, suffering and decay, where they will sit around and wait for eternity to begin.\n\nBut wait, says the Christian : \"What happens after we die?\" It turns out that the rest of the people will get bored, and do evil things. Then we will fall down to Hell and be eaten, burned and murdered by fire, and suffer endless pain in hell. Everyone will be resurrected as they had always been -- but with even worse wounds and suffering than before. That won't stop anybody from being bad.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is where the problem lies.\n\nWe live in this \"natural\" time, and yet people can still be born very flawed. They're simply unable to control themselves! So, naturally, they begin to behave badly. The natural time will then continue for a few more generations -- until it is time for the Second Coming.\n\nThe Second Coming, then, is just what God will do to people living today : He will use what He has left on Earth to punish them for the wrongs they did at the time of their birth. Since God wants them to stay dead, he is going to use whatever tools were left to do just that.\n\nWhat should we do then? Should we go on believing that we will return to a \"perfect\" state after the Second Coming? No! If we are going to return, it means that God must keep doing it for eternity. God knows that He cannot use Satan or God -- only sinners will endure that -- so he must use more and more horrible punishments for each generation.\n\nYou see, the only natural time remaining to Satan is the time before the Second Coming. All God has done is remove the \"natural\" time he used to control Satan. He did not remove the Devil, but rather, used him as a tool to punish sinful folk.\n\nFor you, dear reader, this will be just a tiny bit easier to understand than the idea that God created the world in seven (actually, eight) great days.","token_len":684,"entropy":[3.1583,3.6459,4.1729,5.7998,10.7151,4.7201,1.4781,3.661,2.1841,2.0199,0.3037,1.4484,6.3493,3.9606,5.1429,3.1115,1.2012,1.9961,0.0478,11.0373,1.9321,5.5339,4.2114,1.477,0.5925,4.9125,2.1938,0.7111,1.608,6.0341,1.0673,0.7137,5.2463,1.7991,1.1904,3.1559,3.7824,6.2263,9.8313,1.0196,0.0513,1.2607,1.4112,1.0809,0.8957,0.153,0.7116,3.0674,3.9768,0.9613,0.3239,1.1978,11.7269,1.8513,2.9949,2.4835,0.653,0.5079,0.2406,0.1631,8.6998,3.185,7.4731,4.8142,3.2262,4.6705,2.7251,0.2107,0.5536,4.0584,2.4717,3.3094,3.0916,0.3862,1.6837,0.2543,0.168,0.2428,3.6007,0.2293,0.7099,0.1978,2.8883,0.0894,1.9355,0.0079,3.2611,3.2184,5.0536,0.8388,1.1892,0.8073,3.287,6.1492,0.4627,1.0877,0.7556,4.2811,1.8243,4.8759,4.7695,0.0233,0.4541,0.7152,4.698,4.4953,0.3484,0.2167,0.0888,2.7702,2.0949,0.9223,1.1099,3.193,0.3462,0.5137,1.6644,0.0017,1.6929,0.3389,1.5385,5.1259,5.2947,1.2789,4.0966,3.4703,0.3777,1.3668,2.4577,3.7003,2.5873,3.88,1.8052,0.3534,1.3738,0.938,1.2127,4.4187,1.3559,0.2869,4.0626,0.941,4.6686,0.2231,1.4608,2.7444,0.4384,5.3681,1.9227,5.213,0.1481,0.0407,0.0067,1.1344,2.5117,6.0676,3.7509,2.2403,1.5482,2.836,0.0419,0.1421,0.6764,0.6675,0.0001,4.0052,0.2807,0.2152,4.3658,1.395,4.3294,0.1193,2.4796,4.9831,1.654,1.5638,5.4566,3.5427,0.8916,0.331,0.6483,3.684,0.7112,0.5655,10.4791,0.8878,3.2849,4.2751,1.3776,2.7957,1.8316,0.5245,4.6954,3.6559,5.1558,0.8466,0.6916,3.7157,6.214,6.4822,1.0799,4.332,0.0064,1.4819,0.5184,6.6025,2.1564,2.2303,1.5145,1.9047,0.369,3.8323,0.1266,0.2343,0.3418,1.7375,0.8026,1.7407,1.9782,0.0276,1.0202,2.0131,3.42,4.6171,0.845,0.5482,0.0001,5.4744,0.0402,0.1728,4.6014,5.4945,0.5914,2.7849,6.25,1.5973,1.8667,4.3043,0.0431,3.6194,4.6466,0.2488,1.2855,2.2245,0.0001,5.5662,0.8781,1.9376,5.1828,0.2777,2.2449,0.9107,1.4089,6.6953,0.0019,1.5343,0.3157,1.1519,1.0912,2.109,0.1539,0.36,0.268,1.1363,0.2388,2.6826,3.829,1.4139,2.8907,1.4082,1.1372,1.5784,5.3107,1.6165,1.1417,0.5769,0.3901,6.0043,1.711,1.1558,2.1837,0.3985,2.625,1.1589,2.2969,0.3207,1.4696,0.0002,4.3023,1.5487,0.7835,6.5501,1.0088,2.2696,6.0003,1.1698,3.1501,3.3511,2.2249,2.1696,0.2165,0.9927,5.0752,1.6848,0.0023,0.4841,1.9094,5.5293,0.0178,0.4651,4.5728,2.8688,4.284,3.8231,1.5863,0.4737,5.4483,6.4088,0.4379,1.4526,3.6938,4.1932,0.8192,6.2301,3.0534,1.6396,0.8398,2.3383,1.7162,4.8069,4.4504,4.5413,1.1618,5.297,0.8012,4.1335,2.2973,1.1973,5.0263,2.8849,2.8186,3.6407,3.5163,1.0627,6.0162,0.6214,1.2829,4.1689,4.5118,4.3195,3.6997,3.0539,0.1055,6.0215,2.1546,2.517,6.4056,0.9004,4.7065,1.3605,3.5136,1.4895,0.9881,0.2155,5.0106,5.1092,0.0006,2.7873,4.908,0.5952,2.4071,3.6105,1.4639,0.7756,0.0002,3.2983,2.0541,3.3101,1.0665,0.2716,0.0203,0.0338,3.6909,1.0613,3.4632,1.0798,0.3127,1.4339,0.0002,3.6367,3.232,0.0743,4.8981,4.4691,3.8284,0.6915,7.0275,0.9094,1.3535,2.7395,4.5141,3.8612,2.7156,0.9085,4.7435,7.3681,5.8919,1.7039,2.6749,4.024,6.363,3.6567,0.0161,2.6436,1.645,5.8738,3.7559,1.7646,3.9321,0.0907,1.2431,5.2671,0.7512,5.2283,0.5514,0.812,3.3235,3.5571,3.5255,2.4669,3.0017,3.8097,1.8028,1.3692,2.0585,0.6573,1.8779,3.7819,1.8618,3.1954,1.9572,2.5966,0.4938,0.9173,5.4449,0.0213,1.3245,0.8276,0.0002,2.2359,1.3871,0.0049,2.9622,3.2831,0.0218,0.677,2.996,4.3106,2.6298,4.5823,0.3068,0.9253,4.0152,5.7192,3.6202,4.8709,1.5025,0.1569,3.6003,5.583,2.0462,0.7643,2.9447,3.6364,1.509,0.3385,2.3321,0.8877,1.075,2.4781,4.2083,0.6254,0.2178,2.6614,4.2564,0.4398,2.7708,0.2658,0.735,0.4896,0.2715,5.8366,2.59,4.6636,3.1343,0.2059,5.1539,4.9363,0.4461,1.4003,3.6961,1.0265,0.0064,2.2327,2.8839,3.6188,6.6925,0.9106,1.1618,1.8322,3.3546,0.0167,0.2087,0.5945,0.0002,3.8308,5.079,0.8125,0.8227,2.4762,0.24,3.5997,0.0701,3.2453,2.7647,2.1208,0.7314,1.8013,1.7355,4.6939,0.1884,0.7217,2.6917,2.4007,0.3203,1.5013,2.7149,1.4643,0.2841,0.0059,0.8427,2.6915,1.5282,3.4231,0.8266,3.3983,1.0521,0.0109,3.4098,1.8676,2.5756,4.8052,0.9211,2.1038,4.2634,5.164,3.0346,3.19,2.4708,1.6675,0.5682,3.8203,4.1868,0.9597,2.5976,1.9719,4.915,5.8362,3.5627,3.1209,5.8877,3.6701,5.8346,3.6433,6.3964,3.6017,6.0516,0.8277,1.9228,1.9418,1.6596,5.8873,2.0044,0.0163,2.8252,1.4796,3.1531,2.6735,1.1601,0.5247,0.8502,0.0002,5.0026,0.6924,0.0717,1.5615,2.8811,7.3828,1.6063,6.4476,1.7865,4.9603,0.9065,1.3479,1.1519,1.5331,0.3341,0.1386,0.0039,0.4913,4.5831,5.3615,0.9728,2.5466,1.2369,4.7897,1.1319,4.1307,1.6627,0.3914,1.3037,3.5171,3.1695,0.6818,2.8415,2.6241,1.0074,2.8371,4.9205,0.9739,1.3849,0.8006,5.9404,1.5543,1.6546,3.0271,2.0053,4.5734,1.3045,1.6634,0.4192,0.8671,0.3939,1.2191,4.0404,7.3322,0.6668,1.2528,0.0002,5.0499,4.9083,2.0788,1.2375,0.538,0.0369,1.5058,3.0619,0.9461,4.2178,2.7801,4.035,1.3835,4.3008,0.5969,0.6642,1.9596,1.2189,3.343,0.6575,1.2163,3.2568,1.2471,0.9644,1.2208,1.9824,7.6708,5.118,0.6344,1.8806,0.3772,7.9374,0.7437,0.9357]}

{"id":1252,"ended":true,"length":627,"gen_text":"A man who shows no emotion comes home to find his wife cheating on him... and turns to the one person in the world he can turn to for support: his dog. In this comic from cartoonist Mark Evanier (Rise of the Superheroes, Star Wars, The Complete Animated Series), he tells the story of Howie \u2014 a kindly dog who shows up at the house of Howie (a dog-lover) one day to tell him that his wife is getting an e-mail that says she's been cheating on him all along. There's a simple, sad scene that follows: Howie gets up to go to work, and the dog follows. If you want your heartbreak to be as sweet as this, you need to watch it.\n\n4. Mr. Peabody and Sherman: The Story of Mark Twain and the Making of 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are probably a billion books out there about Mark Twain, and there might be a billion things about Mark Twain that you want to know about, but one of the most fascinating is the story of how he came up with \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" through the characters in \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\" In this graphic novel from cartoonist Peter Bagge (Spider-Man Universe, The Rachael Ray Show) we're introduced to both the Huckleberry brothers in their most famous roles, then as they find Huck through an encounter with a friendly, kind-looking stranger at a book fair. And when the Huckster finds himself in Huck Finn's place \u2014 the latter is now a man \u2014 he struggles to tell the truth about his time at the slave plantation, his family's history, and himself. I don't want to give away the ending, but it's a very different story than that told in the book (which starts out with Huck's coming-of-age story, and then follows him through the rest of his life, as we meet him in the company of a variety of colorful characters).\n\n5. The Best of the Best: 30 Years of the Best Cartoonists (and Their Books!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have seen The Amazing Spider-Man or The Amazing Spider-Man 3, you might already be familiar with artist Todd McFarlane's graphic novel The Best of the Best. The book is more than 30 years old, but the spirit of what it's trying to communicate still rings true today. As someone who knows that McFarlane isn't the best cartoonist in the business, and that he seems to have a bad habit of trying to get artists like Dave Cockrum and Dave McKean to work together (sometimes by having McFarlane show up at their homes and making demands for \"work\" that Cockrum was apparently willing to do), I find the book to be an interesting look into a couple of different ways in which artists are trying to make money by taking a very big risk on a project that is ultimately not going to pay off for them at all. There's plenty of humor sprinkled throughout the book \u2014 McFarlane is known for making fun of his own career in interviews \u2014 but there's also a good deal of genuine concern, because even the most successful comics artist who makes a splash might have a much more difficult time than they expect, given the current economic climate of

Or maybe just a RuneQuest adventure story of some sort?\n\nIf you have any questions on Runequest, email me and I'll do my best to answer you.\n\nThanks for being a part of a good RuneQuest fan community!","token_len":689,"entropy":[5.0839,12.8708,3.6619,4.098,2.592,9.7202,0.7868,6.4008,0.7746,5.7447,1.0947,0.5747,2.1465,6.2742,4.0588,1.9527,1.5479,6.1206,0.0037,1.1726,7.8807,2.2535,0.9198,1.6417,0.0886,1.1728,2.3248,4.2932,0.0943,0.2993,0.3457,5.244,1.3019,5.4185,2.6097,1.4335,0.9265,2.6781,0.2186,1.3037,2.8657,4.0342,0.1658,1.2005,2.6926,1.4633,0.7922,0.1758,0.0134,8.8539,2.5533,1.2442,0.0572,0.6716,0.5038,5.5117,3.305,1.7886,0.8971,0.8649,3.8847,1.4554,0.1519,0.0387,1.839,0.2044,0.1422,0.2805,1.7932,3.5713,2.5835,5.1588,0.9814,3.5183,0.7676,0.9655,0.8179,5.6305,0.3912,4.413,0.5331,0.0482,2.362,4.5013,1.4428,0.0935,0.3776,3.9428,5.5653,1.9572,0.5966,5.3593,0.7418,0.5935,5.7015,0.1387,6.762,0.4071,1.5432,1.5549,5.3725,0.413,2.0466,0.6518,0.4489,0.6462,0.1421,0.0272,6.5916,3.0688,0.7066,0.2118,0.05,1.0168,4.6383,2.8514,1.1552,2.3287,0.4344,0.0186,2.967,0.5777,4.3507,0.7336,4.863,0.1845,2.1972,5.9817,2.5066,2.8684,2.6779,2.5322,0.3555,0.452,1.9062,0.0836,2.9984,0.865,0.8706,0.0874,0.0296,0.7617,1.1402,5.2449,1.7537,1.455,0.8335,0.3234,0.0312,0.0847,0.7571,3.9565,4.8887,1.9806,0.4055,0.5296,0.2142,4.2249,0.0037,3.3023,0.0334,0.1172,0.04,3.8865,3.3652,2.2962,2.894,2.3495,0.0113,0.6304,0.5682,3.5611,0.3783,2.2862,0.334,0.0064,0.9859,1.2875,5.5168,0.4224,1.0914,2.1642,5.25,0.3974,0.0741,1.1397,0.2504,0.4158,0.2733,2.7613,2.7126,0.9836,0.1406,6.446,0.7671,4.8126,0.0343,0.0402,0.4575,0.5152,2.9175,0.322,6.2979,1.138,1.1801,1.7174,0.4287,0.1004,1.2922,2.2553,3.5766,2.1578,2.0602,1.8987,0.4653,0.0501,0.2118,0.3657,0.4148,0.4959,4.0207,0.846,2.4353,0.4142,0.401,3.8079,2.8119,6.0115,0.5857,0.5805,1.3259,0.5958,1.7397,0.1076,1.9248,0.7018,0.0657,0.5523,0.2374,2.5424,0.0039,2.9489,0.4094,1.9871,0.1593,0.0637,0.4887,7.1972,5.7883,3.6564,0.7266,4.088,0.7869,1.2206,0.9299,1.9883,0.0898,1.4904,0.444,5.3155,1.8737,2.2229,0.2038,0.0556,0.3744,2.8539,1.7839,0.2909,0.7506,0.1947,0.0094,1.291,0.4219,3.6524,0.5522,2.0165,0.3684,2.4473,3.9545,0.0009,1.5462,5.9002,0.7945,7.1651,5.4403,1.0649,1.2408,1.5585,1.2137,0.275,3.1136,3.9974,0.0202,0.6595,1.2867,4.4483,0.1611,0.5315,1.7917,1.4831,0.0119,0.0309,0.9119,0.5302,0.1595,0.4851,1.9011,1.6031,0.0229,0.4832,0.6506,3.6089,0.1606,5.2478,0.5239,0.0072,3.6943,1.6182,3.1908,0.7753,3.2775,5.5568,5.5287,0.4653,0.0311,0.1511,0.6106,0.2675,0.1365,2.6988,0.8082,1.0193,0.4697,0.0213,0.3834,0.6916,3.2668,0.0919,0.6936,0.6358,0.7925,0.0033,0.1414,1.2921,1.842,1.8081,3.1906,0.5155,4.2311,0.5056,3.3239,1.6982,5.3768,3.5429,1.9594,0.1295,0.8271,0.6529,3.5488,1.5585,6.1138,0.642,3.3077,0.3401,4.7946,4.2699,3.4678,0.7284,1.9365,5.4958,1.3358,0.1666,4.0009,0.147,2.3765,2.3516,0.4619,3.3142,0.3811,0.3276,0.2409,0.8749,0.4925,3.4647,3.6951,0.2895,4.7121,7.2911,1.1885,4.6604,0.0006,3.3867,4.4901,4.021,2.3938,2.8267,3.6062,0.5542,4.6281,3.7167,1.273,1.7103,2.9632,0.059,0.135,0.2317,5.1319,5.4246,3.6113,0.7126,3.1879,0.5891,2.0293,2.145,3.1753,2.5632,0.7301,4.9899,1.9525,4.8571,0.8786,3.5466,2.1063,1.1539,1.5719,0.4018,3.4676,5.897,3.2836,2.231,0.5674,4.0914,2.4808,1.5893,1.7214,3.6766,5.9189,6.4633,1.9595,0.0436,0.0232,0.0369,1.0472,3.3599,2.0379,3.6597,4.9619,6.1104,3.1145,1.8598,1.4917,0.7382,0.1741,4.2825,2.872,4.5586,0.496,6.1087,2.0752,1.007,0.033,1.5287,2.6472,6.2511,0.0841,0.2626,1.6851,3.271,0.8757,2.2198,3.2852,1.9285,1.6112,0.1049,3.5669,0.3244,4.014,3.393,4.9176,4.2707,4.2393,2.8732,0.0052,1.41,0.2941,2.4137,2.7668,5.6552,4.1476,1.6444,3.1872,3.2186,3.0772,5.5238,1.525,2.3188,5.0265,0.0028,0.8639,3.3711,0.4628,3.2109,3.988,1.0515,1.1793,0.0001,5.3842,5.3689,5.621,2.5817,3.1505,2.4133,4.9977,0.8411,5.6714,1.7615,0.1231,1.2992,2.2278,3.1867,3.3675,5.9209,2.2228,0.8155,0.0002,3.4433,0.1885,3.076,2.1402,0.0992,3.7242,1.3764,0.241,1.1216,1.4275,2.8963,0.2884,2.4355,0.5773,0.4575,4.6683,2.6612,0.9718,2.2475,2.5212,5.5292,3.7388,1.0745,1.5822,0.9875,0.1136,1.333,1.2518,6.0019,2.0843,0.4416,3.4147,5.8592,0.7759,0.4227,0.7961,1.6355,0.0538,0.2006,0.0285,1.2946,5.1084,0.963,3.3904,0.6652,0.2816,0.2218,1.1376,0.8946,2.688,0.59,4.1107,0.0069,2.8323,0.5637,0.2597,4.1482,3.0906,5.5023,0.0992,0.2289,4.4226,5.4865,0.2624,0.0018,0.0822,1.4918,3.6291,2.869,0.638,0.0153,0.4517,2.1554,0.7822,0.5841,2.0614,1.5876,1.4769,0.0238,1.4116,0.2754,1.2586,2.3593,0.5109,5.514,0.685,0.9641,1.1879,3.1009,0.3147,0.1987,0.7632,3.7259,0.6223,0.4738,0.0289,0.2672,1.2201,5.4772,3.5599,2.8809,4.3461,0.9131,0.1965,1.0407,0.0308,0.3237,1.805,2.4459,0.1488,0.0144,0.2946,0.083,6.5609,2.1188,3.3481,1.7944,3.3942,0.0416,3.8398,4.6387,2.6519,2.7407,0.8345,0.4817,1.0969,0.0002,2.4493,0.1128,1.4142,0.5415,0.7274,4.7173,1.2136,2.1933,0.9143,5.7592,0.43,3.0976,0.2572,0.7626,2.0075,0.0321,0.0271,0.0108,0.3299,3.0652,0.6281,1.192,0.0002,2.9865,0.5156,5.5228,0.7619,0.6529,0.0026,4.8589,5.6031,2.7105,0.2176,3.0533,0.5873,0.657]}
{"id":1546,"ended":true,"length":601,"gen_text":"You're a local healer, a good one, and your people love you. But you do not truly heal wounds, merely transfer them... The people of the valley below know you under a different name. \"\n\nIt was in the year 2210 of the solar year of B.C.E., when the people did not know how to pronounce the new king's name, that he was discovered by the Lord. In the year 2332 of B.C.E., King Joab of Israel discovered he was a Nephite king and he was still living at the time of King Benjamin, and his name was changed to Jesus. The people of the hill country were stunned, but they were also amazed; for they knew nothing of Israel's history, but knew of Israel's kings, of which there were three, and of whom there were twenty-one hundred and seventy-five kings in Israel. One of the kings, an ancient king who died in the year 2245 B.C.E., left his people to go to a foreign place, and after a time, he came back with a crown. And in the year 2245 B.C.S., the kings of Canaan and the rulers of the land began to recognize the Lord and to give Him honour. ( 2 Nephi 2:6, 7 )\n\nIn the year 2000 B.C.E., there were two young men, Joseph and his brother Hyrum, who were translating the Book of Mormon. They lived in Palmyra, New York. When they came to the hill country, they asked the angel of the Lord to show them the place where Christ and His disciples were to be found; but neither Joseph nor Hyrum could translate a word of what was written on their plates.\n\nBut in time there were revelations that the plates were real, and they were used in the Book of Mormon. ( Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith III )\n\nThese records were written in the ancient language known as \"Hiram, which is the language of the Jews when Moses was among them.\" This was written for the people of the land to read; and their writing was \"breathed out by inspiration, rather than by the mechanical power of a pen or pencil.\" ( Mosiah 7:26, 27 ) For nearly two thousand years, these writings have been kept by several generations who have continued to write and preserve their writings, which has now been translated into thirteen languages. Each month, missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who live in those countries help some of these writing people convert to the gospel.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about this ancient record, and if you have any questions, our Friend, Elder John E. Hallstrom, of Church Educational System Seminary in Salt Lake City (who is a member of the Church Office of Museum Counselors ) can be reached, by telephone at (202) 405-5815, or by mail at:

{"id":3441,"ended":true,"length":683,"gen_text":"A new gameshow starts playing on every station worldwide. The rules of the game ; Say what you want to win, and if you don't answer ten questions in a row correctly, then something of equal value is lost. After three hours someone says `` A glimpse of God. '' and the entire channel freezes in disbelief. The game continues on. The contestants are allowed to guess as many facts as possible from a list of questions. They answer three- to four- word facts as fast as possible but are NOT allowed to correct any mistakes or questions. If a contestant screws up and is asked to explain he has no time and is about to be erased. If a contestant misses a fact, he is given another opportunity to guess. The contestant has 15 minutes to answer all questions. To win, you have to guess the answer for each question correctly... with time. A contestant's guess is worth one point. If they know what a card is but can't tell the value in the clue, they get three points. If they can't explain any answer or what it means, they get two points. If they can't find a word but the clue has a word, they get zero points. A contestant with seven or more correct answers for each question wins the prize of a lifetime.... and $ 500,000. If you think this is too good to be true, think again. The contestants have one hour each to play the game. If they can't do the game in twenty- five minutes then they have to answer every question without any help and are booted from the game. If there is no answer in a two days' time, that contestant is fired and the game goes on. There are two kinds of questions. The first is based on a word clue. The first word of the clue is a guess by the contestant. The contestant reads a line from the clue and then writes it at the top of the page in their answer. An example of this would be `` The most beautiful words in any language. '' The contestant guesses `` the most beautiful words in any language will be used to make a bomb. '' There is one answer per line. If the contestant guesses a wrong answer during that line, he or she is out of the game. He or she can try again during the next line. So the contestant guesses the first line of the clue and writes it at the top of the page. But if the contestant writes a wrong answer, he is out of the game. On another line the contestant has a choice of one of 20 words. One of these words is the correct answer. What is the correct answer? The contestant has three minutes to think about it, then he or she selects the correct word. Next line the contestant picks a guess from the list of 20 words and writes it at the top of the page. One of the phrases that comes up is `` all human beings are born gay.'' What is that phrase? A contestant might guess '' all men are born gay '' or he or she might pick one of the other phrases. What are the other possibilities? Why did the judge pick one of these phrases? You might also consider asking the judge why she picked one example (the phrase `` gay '') over any of the other phrases. There could be two reasons for this. The two phrases might have totally different meanings. Or the judge was bored and picked the phrase that sounded the most interesting.","token_len":691,"entropy":[5.0839,10.4289,5.3194,6.6591,7.2753,2.4146,5.4901,5.6937,6.6167,1.221,2.2545,4.675,2.2107,0.4754,0.4064,13.2436,10.8346,3.0611,0.3469,0.6631,0.7336,6.1157,1.8239,1.5242,3.566,0.3216,2.1159,0.0103,5.7535,8.4431,0.6479,3.4599,1.3211,0.3307,2.5722,0.3311,3.627,6.9998,8.0524,4.1194,0.9583,1.3351,2.229,0.6136,5.2807,4.0584,2.8927,6.8769,5.3655,10.2441,8.4334,10.3236,0.3299,4.7409,2.6497,1.065,2.9371,1.3865,4.4624,5.9925,5.7961,3.925,4.2296,0.2208,1.8288,2.4523,2.5769,2.5258,3.0064,1.9537,3.2804,1.2494,3.9739,0.3389,5.3508,2.7105,0.1666,4.3396,0.1656,2.7179,3.5138,1.0807,1.3145,0.3777,3.014,1.008,2.5996,3.8816,4.9989,5.3742,4.4624,1.8018,0.0717,4.07,3.8315,3.492,1.9664,0.0268,0.9667,5.5687,2.2375,6.3698,0.1344,0.0137,4.9029,2.2559,1.7396,3.1123,5.7315,0.8193,2.0451,2.0614,0.3918,5.9995,0.0219,2.8454,3.4796,3.3086,0.5117,3.2841,4.5539,2.3307,3.9224,1.7867,2.5451,1.779,5.6715,0.0109,0.9622,5.3801,0.9855,2.5161,1.4309,0.2307,4.8301,0.7307,1.9187,1.7217,0.8625,1.0167,1.8505,2.9334,2.83,0.4233,2.6237,1.7051,1.8878,1.8517,3.8097,4.358,0.9234,0.199,1.1853,1.4576,1.5794,1.4775,6.234,1.021,1.2537,3.2622,1.2014,0.0177,1.1907,1.0157,2.8597,5.1586,2.1607,0.8048,0.7835,7.5407,5.2597,3.9909,4.692,3.9528,0.9968,3.8061,1.7214,0.6715,2.5793,1.5058,0.3923,0.6963,1.1101,4.2043,6.0044,4.1455,3.4393,5.7389,0.6429,2.0945,1.6337,0.0203,2.6571,2.3666,2.1683,4.3201,1.7538,3.6656,0.5429,0.6723,1.4792,3.2243,0.0869,0.3143,0.392,0.3727,1.5737,0.8465,3.6956,4.9002,4.423,3.3904,5.4886,2.8309,0.6263,0.3511,0.1973,0.397,2.3913,0.0362,0.1117,0.4718,0.4624,1.5005,0.5559,4.3834,1.471,3.285,3.7686,4.0635,1.1014,2.5453,0.8829,1.067,1.7698,0.2115,0.0732,4.3166,0.0623,0.0778,3.1385,0.4952,2.1826,5.1215,0.7882,0.1392,1.0036,0.77,5.0803,1.9482,0.2024,1.0021,1.2079,2.9342,3.6983,1.5902,3.9532,6.6022,3.8253,4.4375,6.8476,0.9272,0.0442,0.6381,2.2432,2.0651,3.356,1.7241,0.9736,1.9866,2.2905,0.033,0.0056,0.0035,0.1921,2.5202,0.0369,0.3415,1.627,2.7393,2.3003,5.0487,1.3643,4.4094,0.8814,3.2606,0.9111,0.1129,0.9146,1.2191,0.4301,2.3715,0.3539,3.3501,2.9637,0.4725,0.804,6.0166,1.5334,2.6665,0.0225,3.8473,0.4209,2.2758,0.214,3.4665,4.0007,0.1554,5.0856,2.2336,2.8314,2.9037,2.6935,5.7788,0.7468,0.028,0.9565,0.1961,1.8385,5.016,0.7487,1.9149,3.5081,3.2679,2.5199,5.0623,7.9392,2.3515,0.064,0.4598,4.0052,0.4014,0.624,5.1204,1.9143,1.3114,1.4934,2.9769,0.5786,1.2927,3.4114,0.7987,2.8283,3.8341,0.0078,2.1525,1.2045,1.5107,0.4517,1.4902,4.1527,0.062,2.2695,3.2593,4.7661,0.8094,0.9708,3.9601,1.5575,1.6677,0.4921,0.2436,0.6318,2.8009,5.2433,4.8869,0.0851,0.161,0.4454,0.5934,1.599,5.2035,2.7291,3.1771,1.1353,0.2867,0.134,0.7769,1.7989,3.7272,0.8038,6.5528,0.2476,2.0065,0.0963,0.4959,1.7359,3.274,3.2497,1.7709,0.2809,6.0783,0.8708,0.8774,0.9156,1.7122,0.0169,1.2664,3.0437,5.3752,2.2649,5.6319,1.0575,5.1273,0.0161,0.7925,0.3538,0.9755,0.6923,4.0062,4.158,3.3797,0.3788,0.1732,0.3251,0.1156,0.0989,0.0215,8.2058,0.7863,4.095,0.9485,3.3856,1.2256,4.7688,0.6736,0.2906,4.6586,1.1159,2.3053,4.607,2.5593,1.3579,0.6006,1.9636,0.6562,0.1191,1.3834,2.559,2.393,1.1844,6.0279,3.1784,0.5458,0.4245,2.2154,1.3657,0.0013,0.6414,1.777,1.1932,0.0759,0.0859,0.3068,6.3862,0.0775,0.0025,2.1038,2.3125,0.3686,4.0177,0.1983,0.2468,0.3626,0.8087,5.7819,1.8,0.5063,4.8953,1.3872,1.6802,1.7147,1.9718,0.1395,0.2333,1.0165,1.1328,0.4728,1.2471,0.018,0.0383,0.1589,0.0461,0.0657,0.4743,5.5596,2.4527,0.8699,0.1683,3.6527,1.4464,0.8695,0.2001,1.0727,0.8427,3.498,0.3226,0.3477,0.0205,0.0298,0.4306,5.6243,5.3312,0.2954,1.416,0.1288,2.4604,3.5366,2.1816,0.8228,3.2546,0.4156,6.6183,0.9965,0.6146,4.1859,0.5119,0.9649,0.2197,0.3816,1.2533,2.2255,0.1963,0.6717,6.5778,1.686,0.4467,0.645,0.1059,0.2076,1.2046,0.3294,1.5377,3.5215,0.6225,0.1487,4.7274,0.8307,1.2516,2.7039,1.3241,2.174,0.1735,0.0012,6.762,0.6338,0.3317,1.1877,0.7715,6.281,4.3951,1.2773,0.1174,4.2232,1.2384,4.3225,2.2213,0.7195,1.3801,0.4677,1.5151,0.3462,1.8851,0.6172,0.1355,0.3677,0.0046,0.0541,0.0376,0.0089,0.0364,0.1525,5.0074,0.9641,0.7579,5.45,2.7394,3.1275,0.6114,1.0238,0.2034,5.1515,5.9644,0.7385,0.508,1.1849,4.1446,2.3072,2.5935,0.5222,3.1679,1.4058,0.1627,3.5386,0.5692,4.2618,1.321,3.6445,1.0271,3.6211,0.1894,0.417,0.2282,2.6006,0.8656,3.3027,0.4803,0.0013,0.2171,3.4055,2.6797,0.0861,0.18,1.2044,1.2939,0.6906,3.2673,2.7729,0.1795,1.3267,6.8743,0.0635,6.1705,2.8719,0.4648,5.2416,2.4256,1.6903,0.6056,1.1581,0.5199,0.3471,4.7122,2.9615,3.7322,4.1794,2.7541,0.7443,1.5015,2.6467,4.421,0.9424,0.9851,7.9169,5.6675,1.8179,1.4274,0.5626,4.8599,2.4955,0.1007,0.9948,3.1798,1.0896,0.0816,0.3561,1.1301,0.6062,3.5661,5.3231,0.1459,4.5619,0.7841,1.2032,0.7705,0.3474,1.6596,7.4627,0.6818,1.8606,1.4351,5.6932,0.0504,0.1696,0.4864,2.3471,0.9089,0.9186,3.908,5.2745,0.8111,1.5351,1.4075,0.8584,0.6793,1.925,1.6754,0.7506,1.789,0.5646]}
{"id":4110,"ended":false,"length":615,"gen_text":"Its the year 2277, genetic modification is legal, but not without its controversies. Your problem? Your parents are hardcore furries. You've spent your entire life fantasizing about those furries. Their favorite species is fox-girl. In short, you are a furry.\n\nYou are the protagonist in a story about a fox-girl's quest to find out why the world is ruled by humans.\n\nThe game is currently in early alpha state, hence the name. It's still very early, and if it succeeds, we're going to do some major updates. The first update will feature:\n\nA brand new campaign, with a playable story.\n\nA new area.\n\nA new item : fox-girl's pendant.\n\n. New music, more voice acting and a new background track.\n\nThe second update will include:\n\nNew animations.\n\n. A new item.\n\n. New game mechanics and an in-game tutorial.\n\nWe have a small team of friends from all over the world. We've worked together in many different countries and on several projects. You can see some details about our team on our team page.\n\nWe are very excited to bring a new story to the world of games and to do it with the talents of great game developers like Daniel Lantieri, our co-founder, who created the game engine and built the game's visual aesthetic; and the other members of the team, who put a lot of effort into improving the game's quality and user friendlyness.\n\nAll-that-with-out our Kickstarter campaign\n\nBut we don't have a Kickstarter page just yet.\n\nThe reason is simply this : I want to know at least one thing before funding the project. I've talked with some people and we think that the game may be successful. But before we can make the game, we need the money to work full time. The goal of this campaign is simply to show you that you are interested in this project.\n\nWhen will the game be finished?\n\nHere is how the development process will go.\n\nOnce we have the goal of the project, we can start doing all kinds of things, like making music, working on concept art, designing a new area, etc.\n\nWhat are the rewards and the prices?\n\nAll rewards we have to offer are very high quality. All of the rewards are digital. As a pledge, you will, first, get unlimited access to new artwork for this project, once we release the game.\n\nOur goal is very ambitious, and we want to provide more stuff to you : for example, we want to make two versions of this game : one with a new story, and another with a new world, both with new items, art, puzzles, enemies, areas, music and much more.\n\nHow to buy our game?\n\nWe will

{"id":1904,"ended":false,"length":659,"gen_text":"You are the host of a popular children's show. You are live on air when you, and the rest of the country, have just received news that nuclear weapons have been deployed against your nation and can't be stopped. There are only minutes left. What would you do? If the president ordered you to stop the show, what would you do?\n\nAnswer: I would do anything and everything to stop the show.\n\nBut it would cost everything I own. My job, my career, everything. I'm willing to do anything and pay the price.\n\nIt is a very serious decision\u2014one that could lead to the loss of my job and the end of my career. The decision will have two major financial repercussions. There are the legal costs; one would be to obtain a lawyer to challenge the president's assertion\u2014without evidence\u2014that his powers do not authorize the use of force. The more difficult financial issue is the potential damage to my public image. The public is watching, and it would damage me if I didn't do it.\n\nOf course, there are many reasons not to participate.\n\nPeople have made some of the most serious mistakes in our politics. I couldn't help telling you about this. A few days ago, some members of the Senate began to question the president's legitimacy when he claimed executive authority to order a nuclear strike. Some even went so far as to challenge the legitimacy of his office.\n\nI think these actions are dangerous. At the same time, the constitutional role of the president is too important to let these irresponsible senators undermine it by seeking to impugn his legitimacy as commander in chief.\n\nWhat will I be doing to support Republicans, independents and Democrats who share my concern?\n\nI will talk, and I will explain. In private, you're still free to tell this audience what you think at dinner conversations; at a party at the president's residence; I will have a private conversation with my guests. No secret. On Facebook, you can let those whom you trust know I'm going to make it clear that this is what's happening. But when you are going on television, you shouldn't try to deceive people.\n\nI want to share one more piece of advice with you. Your viewers are watching you tonight, and they might make some critical decisions during the broadcast about how you vote. For instance, my friend from Texas said to me he'd been talking to his friends who are voting Republican all day, and the one thing they all said was to vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court. I'm sure you heard that. My viewers are very sophisticated. You know that people watch you to evaluate who they think should become president, not whether they think that person would be a good president.\n\nSo I just want to make one more plea to my viewers. Make sure you've had your chance to vote. And if you haven't, give it enough thought to make sure you've done it. And if you're undecided, take a little break to think about it and ask yourself a few questions about how you can be sure of your vote.\n\nThere may be an overwhelming case to be made. But your time is limited, and I am confident that in the great tradition of the American deliberative process, you will find the perfect decision in your conscience.

{"id":4398,"ended":false,"length":644,"gen_text":"A man starts to believe he's asleep and dreaming and starts `` lucid dreaming '' ( basically doing what he wants to do ), by the end, he realizes he's not dreaming.\n\nLucid dreaming is the practice of using the dreams to gain insights about how to use reality. In this section, I discuss some lucid dreams that seem to demonstrate that humans have the potential to enter states of awareness using lucid dreaming techniques.\n\nAnother lucid dream related discovery\n\nThe author mentions the book ''The Secret'', a book about how to enter a state of awareness called '' lucid dreaming ''. But there's another discovery that we can make with the use of lucid dreaming techniques : the potential to have a lucid dream.\n\nThe key to the lucid dream is the application of what we know about the state of consciousness called LUCK.\n\nHere's the explanation the book gives about the importance of this state\n\nLUCK can be considered to be some sort of a mind-set. In it, people believe that they are not affected by what's going on around them. They are at ease... This may sound good for a while, but eventually, it will become irritating to some. They will not know what to do with themselves... When they eventually do realize that they are going to lose control of their minds, they will probably lose their will to fight...\n\nIn other words... when we are doing something and we begin to realize that we are losing the ability to control what we are doing, we can then choose to enter the state of lucidity. What happens when you enter will depend on your attitude and skill.\n\nOnce in lucid dreaming, you will have the ability to see clearly and you will not be bothered by what's going on around you. Once a little while, you'll lose yourself in your dreams, and then you'll do many wonderful things..\n\nIf this sounds like the beginning of something new, I recommend reading the book The Secret, and it should be considered one of the most important books that you should start reading right away.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to follow the lucid dream techniques, then the book \"The Lucid Dream Manual\" will help you. It also has an important list of recommended lucid dreaming meditation techniques. Finally, a book is also available called \" The Secret \" for people who don't want a real life encounter. It's kind of a guide to lucid dreaming, but it can also be combined with lucid dreaming meditation.\n\nConclusion\n\nI hope you found these lucid dream techniques helpful. They were discovered by scientists, psychologists and meditators, and they represent a whole new way to think about lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming has a huge array of applications, and we can't wait for lucid dreaming to be explored by children, teenagers and adults.\n\nFor beginners, lucid dreaming techniques can be used to create lucid dreams.

{"id":802,"ended":true,"length":685,"gen_text":"Describe your descent into Hell, where you were chained in the underground prison of the damned. Describe your struggle for freedom in Hell and what happened when you were defeated and released to the surface. Describe the time you were released, and what you did with those years after your release. Who or what saved you and what happened after you returned. How your life and actions have changed since you were released. Where and how you were taken in the final stages of the fight against the Lord of the damned, and who were your enemies. The reasons for why you were sent to Hell, as well as any personal messages the Devil had given you for your victory over him. Explain what a torture chamber is, and what the symbols represent. How the symbols are used in communication with other demons and beings in your universe, and what is the meaning of them. Explain that there are many forms of torture, and how they are applied to some of the other demons and demons in the greater world. How each form of torture and torture chamber will manifest from the various demons. Describe the tortures you have experienced, your beliefs about how they might manifest, and the reasons why one might decide to inflict torture, which will then be applied to the demons and beings your own world. This is an advanced class in the study of Demonology. Demonology is the study of the devils, fallen angels, and demons. It can also be called Demonology of Hell. It will help you better understand and describe demons, and how they are involved with our world, as well as, how they can cause great harm and evil on our planet, as well as, how they can be helpful in a practical way. We'll examine ways in which Satan's minions are able to do harm to humans, as well as how different demons and devils act for different purposes. We'll also take a look at the history of religion's relationship with demons and evil, as well as, how you can best avoid using demons in your everyday life. You've probably heard the saying: If you want something done right, do it yourself. In this class you are going to learn about the important part people play in working with demons and evil. When you do something wrong, you can be sure that someone somewhere is going to blame you, and we will cover the various kinds of demons and evil beings that will be used against you. You will learn how, and why, to use a Demon, and how to make a demon work for you. What kinds of demonic experiences will help you in your professional life, as well as, our personal lives. We will show you two particular techniques, one of which we call the \"Black Mass\" technique... and a second, we call the \"Mass of Flame,\" or \"Fire Mass\" technique. We ask that the Devil, the Fallen Angel, and the Demon of Darkness be kept away from the class. We teach this class in a relaxed, supportive setting, in order to assist you in mastering your powers of discernment. There is plenty of humor and great spirituality in the class, so you will likely pass out several times. The lessons will also prepare you for the upcoming and final trial in class. After the end of the class, we will make things interesting a little bit. This will include a Halloween costume, Halloween candy, as well as, some other fun tricks. Don't forget to RSVP on class forums.","token_len":694,"entropy":[1.8204,1.5391,11.2704,3.3093,6.0276,2.186,4.1038,0.7886,1.8821,4.6152,2.5888,1.5541,5.664,3.0366,1.8549,1.0991,4.1504,0.786,1.9049,0.0006,1.2712,4.4959,2.7301,0.3006,2.6496,1.4845,2.3738,3.164,2.6264,2.1959,0.141,1.6973,6.2126,2.2649,2.7376,3.07,0.8671,1.4523,0.2963,1.7478,0.0001,1.2297,5.614,0.8476,1.0676,2.7417,2.7015,0.9076,1.2243,1.2725,0.4166,2.2314,5.9276,2.0505,4.7547,1.393,0.3134,0.082,5.5836,3.7526,0.0394,3.855,0.2529,2.9719,2.1077,2.4172,2.8704,0.6988,2.603,2.6504,3.3765,4.713,1.6385,4.1423,3.1707,1.5587,1.1039,1.0949,1.4744,0.5688,0.8453,0.8585,4.8586,3.259,0.9039,0.1707,2.8391,5.003,3.3427,1.8889,4.4929,3.8853,0.0788,1.5938,5.1782,1.3086,0.9436,4.3458,0.2837,1.0983,3.8462,2.2461,1.4418,2.8677,5.087,1.3312,2.3348,0.9515,4.5811,4.6789,1.2985,3.8677,0.3466,1.1866,2.483,0.2794,0.3558,1.222,4.0141,0.125,0.01,3.5833,3.9065,5.2402,4.9507,4.5146,3.2919,3.7271,0.0822,4.8042,1.0965,5.9464,1.3582,0.4999,0.2309,4.6536,2.3591,4.6873,5.6196,0.9192,0.4057,0.6453,0.5481,1.2299,2.7214,5.9099,4.0508,0.381,2.7425,1.6992,2.7109,1.5565,1.2958,1.9153,5.3914,0.7715,2.8499,2.8022,1.4947,5.6936,1.9772,5.488,3.2505,2.392,0.6461,1.3914,3.9284,1.4974,1.1711,0.2128,2.3468,0.1316,2.7727,3.1925,3.3604,0.3495,1.6865,3.5274,0.0691,0.2964,1.4813,0.7589,1.5193,1.6105,0.8607,3.7927,0.9982,5.8294,1.3566,0.4874,4.3027,1.3389,1.0339,4.2103,0.8326,1.5162,5.8422,2.9087,0.3836,2.5652,3.9928,1.2863,0.3812,0.0217,5.0534,2.122,0.7793,3.8646,5.2505,5.4291,1.0209,4.5978,1.7583,3.6334,1.418,0.0005,0.9034,5.1889,0.2771,1.9657,1.0647,1.361,1.2912,5.7032,5.5911,1.1327,3.4247,1.5705,4.2416,4.8166,0.4407,0.181,1.921,3.3593,1.3505,6.1404,1.8821,5.7942,0.182,2.4112,2.1933,4.2267,4.6236,2.5369,2.9208,1.6761,2.9458,0.3498,2.1385,2.1604,2.0758,1.4252,6.6333,4.5573,2.2501,1.5234,5.4512,1.6999,2.4444,3.2586,3.8518,1.9147,1.5085,3.5836,0.0295,5.0226,0.0005,0.7349,3.5177,0.0804,0.9305,1.2944,0.2015,0.0484,1.1089,4.3096,1.075,4.8402,0.0316,0.143,1.0192,1.2279,1.1402,1.5917,4.0029,1.3922,0.2093,2.3912,2.8853,0.0154,2.2437,2.4761,0.6829,2.2856,4.0214,2.6853,0.3574,3.2641,0.0665,3.3654,2.8097,2.5379,0.966,1.782,1.9025,0.3501,1.9209,3.4955,1.7768,3.5049,0.5092,2.2494,2.1162,0.0591,0.0121,5.483,1.4329,0.9682,2.2832,4.0627,2.5004,0.5845,1.8026,2.9508,3.5618,1.8459,1.2241,2.6212,1.9911,0.2366,0.0264,0.6111,0.7288,0.8626,0.568,1.3359,4.1959,2.4426,3.8064,6.0626,1.0886,0.4401,4.2241,4.7651,4.1748,6.3814,1.2703,0.0115,4.2637,2.9157,2.1014,2.0807,2.1003,0.0115,3.9273,1.3019,0.976,2.2705,0.8503,1.7198,0.011,0.0118,2.6933,6.4241,1.3866,1.5077,2.4681,4.712,5.0891,2.5395,0.3696,0.5139,1.5159,0.3044,0.9696,4.1253,0.1006,0.3185,0.034,1.1782,4.3192,0.2267,6.8509,4.0198,1.6481,0.1888,0.7777,0.9192,3.0179,1.1488,1.4555,0.0353,0.014,1.0498,1.007,4.8477,0.2447,3.2462,2.9286,5.9725,0.914,1.7299,0.3621,2.6004,0.1578,0.2754,3.2419,5.0029,2.2045,0.4845,1.7748,2.4883,3.2623,3.6815,0.3985,2.4125,3.268,0.1669,0.3698,0.0343,0.069,0.0048,0.0044,0.2248,2.9679,0.9242,0.4207,1.8819,4.0985,0.5184,0.004,0.4825,3.4158,1.165,5.5288,3.7556,5.4375,0.8155,0.0741,5.6523,0.5065,0.3199,0.7893,0.895,1.2224,4.7278,0.8163,3.2216,1.0216,1.7029,0.2605,0.8404,2.3528,1.9748,0.4452,0.7339,1.4283,2.9323,0.8819,1.2353,0.0043,3.6034,0.4431,1.7737,0.7164,4.6957,2.189,4.5261,1.5431,1.9678,5.0178,0.0126,1.7138,0.8411,1.69,1.3588,0.7322,2.5169,1.7773,1.5641,1.2528,0.1694,0.9267,1.7853,1.0672,0.7522,0.9591,6.0976,2.0354,0.6171,0.3648,2.2589,2.2115,2.6695,4.5842,2.5122,1.0554,0.7274,0.4443,4.0087,2.4924,2.6789,1.7276,0.1972,0.1124,0.4444,5.0646,3.4633,0.0103,4.3594,5.4154,2.6241,1.9586,0.1262,2.56,0.438,6.003,0.8163,0.5067,1.8055,0.0172,0.0214,0.2836,6.5056,1.8007,0.7987,0.1495,1.6227,0.935,5.32,0.1116,7.1029,6.0611,3.8232,2.6542,2.3209,1.6207,0.125,3.5966,1.6717,0.8352,1.1964,5.5372,1.9413,1.5254,2.1102,7.331,2.4614,3.7039,1.9824,2.6654,2.9215,0.2908,0.2912,0.0877,5.4402,1.1777,4.9236,3.1228,3.9017,0.858,3.24,3.3838,2.2331,0.1921,0.3621,1.404,7.8718,0.8591,4.5179,5.7134,3.8287,2.6091,1.8595,1.14,0.164,0.5993,0.7673,1.0617,2.7748,2.7173,1.2071,3.3352,1.4511,0.0675,0.9756,0.9265,0.8415,1.9528,6.3332,2.2691,0.3933,1.1943,1.2228,3.8613,0.6685,3.8804,4.6432,0.8401,3.1659,1.4749,0.16,4.7885,0.5889,0.349,4.6059,1.3694,3.6037,0.82,2.7359,0.0002,1.171,4.3051,1.1129,5.8146,0.0578,4.2214,1.6685,5.8795,5.1172,0.597,2.5668,0.5491,0.7646,2.1147,1.9105,1.1146,5.8615,6.8689,1.1989,3.1977,0.0189,2.0263,2.8432,5.0519,1.6202,3.4362,5.4985,0.0243,0.4537,1.3947,3.0247,5.1261,2.4277,5.9188,2.297,4.3988,0.925,3.606,1.5786,4.9794,0.0321,0.8996,0.3502,0.2938,1.436,0.597,4.7359,6.908,2.9898,5.1593,0.8492,0.6182,1.5501,4.2954,1.8281,1.7008,1.4635,5.3065,1.6953,3.3985,4.1363,2.0836,0.1767,5.7547,0.0022,0.0129,1.1317,2.3679,3.2097,1.3869,4.8255,1.7159,5.471,0.0107,1.4723,0.5492,5.1539,0.0,2.0389,6.1921,5.1675,1.2665]}
{"id":2376,"ended":false,"length":625,"gen_text":"You're a demon who's primary target is edgy teens willing to ironically sell their souls [ wp ]\n\n[\u2026] that are the true enemy of the free world.\n\nBut I am so serious with this: I'm also an evil capitalist.\n\nI am in the business of producing products that are extremely offensive to the powerful.\n\nWhich is why [ I ] am [ and ] have so many enemies. [ wp ]\n\nWhen I put my efforts into creating these things, I'm willing to do anything that I can to make sure that my customers will love them and that they'll have a positive reaction.\n\nBut since I hate our country so much, I will do pretty much anything to make sure they don't.\n\nHere's the big secret that our military is trying to keep secret, because they don't want to make me look evil:\n\nAmerica's military knows that, as an evil capitalist using edgy teens to get rich, I am doing their nation a tremendous favor by getting them hooked on the idea of buying my products and giving them money.\n\nThey know that, by making their soldiers so edgy, that they will not be able to use their weapons effectively to serve their country's war effort, which will save countless lives.\n\nI think I speak for many of my enemies when I say, \"Thank God for edgy teens!\"\n\nBecause the more they hate me, the fewer people will be willing to use American equipment.\n\n(By the way, our military will only be able to defend us when the American people support using it.)\n\nNow, the rest of my list of enemies is kind of boring. I won't even go into detail; I'll just say that I've written a book that nobody wants to buy (you may enjoy the title).\n\nAlso, I love playing with myself\u2026\n\nThat I can barely sit still in. [ wp ]\n\nMost of all, I love my family, for which I am extremely grateful.\n\nI've got three beautiful girls.\n\nThree absolutely sweet little ladies with personalities and talents that would make most men proud.\n\nAnd even as you're reading this, I'm enjoying a long day of being their Daddy.\n\nWhat should I write about today? [ wp ]\n\n[\u2026] but I can only really reveal my real personality in interviews.\n\nAnd since these interviews are mostly about my life, some of them are kind of funny.\n\nI think it's worth seeing if it's as interesting as you'd expect. [ wp ]\n\nMy friends and my family are a very important part of all of this\u2026\n\nThey're also what I rely on to keep me sane during this long lonely trip through life.

{"id":1365,"ended":true,"length":636,"gen_text":"You discover the legendary weapon, capable of defeating all evil. However, its definition of 'Evil'is a bit skewed.\n\nHowever, its definition of 'Evil'is a bit skewed.\n\nThe story is centered upon Ryo and Kiyoko, who has a dream of a world where there are no demons, and humans are always pure and free from evil. Unfortunately, this dream does not come true. The story explores their inner turmoil, and the main plotline revolves around their efforts to save themselves, but also the world around them.\n\nDespite it's short length (just over 100 pages ) the manga tells a fairly fast paced story, with good characters development. If you enjoyed one the other's, you may want to give this one a try.\n\nStory\n\nIt has a simple plot centered around two friends Ryo and Kiyoko, who have the dream to no longer be plagued by the evil entity, Darken. However, Darken has taken over their world, so Kiyoko and Ryo must use their magical powers to try and stop it from invading. Despite there being many conflicts in the story, like who is more evil, or why there are so very many humans in the world where demons aren't present. The story explores their inner turmoil (and the rest of the world around them), and the focus is mostly around these two main characters and their daily struggles.\n\nThe short length lets this manga be easily read. It could be read as a standalone series or you could continue the series with this one episode.\n\nArt\n\nAlthough the art is simple, it isn't anything outstanding. However the art is nice enough for a manga, as it doesn't detract from the story. One character, Ryo, doesn't really stand out, but what could be is the art style.\n\nThe art style isn't anything that will stand out as a big feature of the manga, but just helps it stay light-hearted with its humor.\n\nCharacter\n\nThe story will center around two characters. Kiyoko, a young girl who dreams to have a world where the evil of monsters did not exist, and Ryo, a young boy who dreams of a world where there is no danger of demons. Though their inner turmoil is what drives the plot line for the manga, they still have decent character development. Overall, the story doesn't really have any real focus on any particular character, but the two certainly do, so you'll probably like them a little better than someone who doesn't.\n\nEnjoyment\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this manga quite a bit. Personally, I didn't find any major flaw in the story, but it just wasn't exactly what I needed (especially as it's a short manga). The short length also helps this manga be enjoyable. A quick read would leave you a satisfied with the story, with no real trouble finding a thing to complain about.\n\nOverall\n\nOverall, this one was very enjoyable. I found that it wasn't quite what I wanted, but I did enjoy it a lot nonetheless.\n\nThat was the only thing I didn't like about it. It also had a cute art style, and I really liked seeing a nice looking woman portrayed in it.\n\nRecommendation\n\nOverall, if you like comedy in a short time period, I'd recommend giving this a try.","token_len":696,"entropy":[9.8042,2.1225,7.3002,4.7588,1.8887,8.3129,0.0063,3.5974,3.1191,3.9901,1.3819,3.6585,0.0569,4.0239,11.0396,1.5612,2.852,5.3863,0.02,10.4195,2.7682,1.7414,4.989,0.666,2.4228,0.0082,6.5359,0.1408,3.7991,0.1633,0.011,0.0527,0.1292,0.0065,0.0354,0.0054,0.0036,0.0004,0.012,1.7431,0.0001,2.5199,4.2245,1.9576,5.1145,5.3449,6.1618,2.9484,2.5586,4.5092,2.9043,2.7451,0.5798,2.1394,4.8596,1.8203,4.2862,0.7958,3.307,1.7442,0.7494,3.0709,1.2805,0.1016,3.8134,1.5207,1.3197,4.0832,1.4971,4.8675,5.4699,0.9637,3.6142,1.8603,1.8481,0.2009,4.5287,0.132,2.4708,1.3755,4.0357,0.0342,0.8059,0.1166,1.3474,2.3983,1.9538,4.3951,3.0116,4.7947,3.4588,1.2256,1.1131,1.6605,5.522,3.2534,2.6825,1.5154,0.0304,1.5759,4.1887,0.1014,3.0017,4.0731,2.3533,4.7939,1.4638,1.2663,1.2544,2.5702,0.0133,0.3008,0.6539,0.0001,5.6485,4.0041,0.6243,2.4102,0.2468,3.1814,3.4275,1.391,3.1961,0.9671,8.6904,1.2462,3.1119,4.9059,0.3444,4.4466,5.4297,0.6777,0.5396,1.0821,1.581,4.6845,3.6074,4.6829,1.4055,5.1128,0.0949,3.7957,4.6896,5.0012,0.8129,3.0976,1.1019,1.0091,3.7105,1.9316,0.0066,1.1156,0.4924,0.6136,0.0126,0.5369,0.3319,0.7629,0.0002,3.8881,1.8579,0.0002,4.1926,4.1007,1.0686,3.2705,1.2853,5.9653,0.1686,1.1969,3.706,4.0724,0.0011,0.1089,0.0381,0.0021,0.0037,0.8668,0.5541,1.3491,3.4668,1.354,2.1362,4.2439,0.0794,0.7876,1.9904,0.1717,1.6232,1.6635,6.3676,2.3514,5.7347,5.2922,0.6714,1.1972,0.0646,2.7037,0.0026,2.1654,4.1681,0.8669,1.2416,1.6622,0.6312,4.4918,4.419,0.0035,0.0029,1.0696,0.0358,0.0006,0.8553,3.8046,0.5993,3.5295,1.1901,0.2098,3.7699,0.4093,2.0605,1.4166,2.6101,3.964,2.1054,6.1048,4.5363,0.3216,2.836,5.2053,1.8345,0.3202,0.3849,0.2005,5.7449,4.0561,1.187,3.0333,0.6624,0.4818,2.7836,3.1803,3.1087,0.8258,1.0026,7.5645,0.4883,4.3992,2.1592,0.6654,0.2122,5.9683,2.4181,3.9241,0.0013,2.3281,2.7615,1.4372,0.7769,3.9423,0.9576,0.2106,0.1336,6.0898,2.4275,1.7797,5.4188,0.0474,0.2125,0.7635,0.7261,0.0325,1.2403,0.4824,0.3259,7.1464,0.7376,3.3889,4.2056,3.7735,0.1768,3.0585,0.0966,3.0898,0.3743,6.1544,1.2693,0.3974,0.3834,0.0002,2.2054,6.1978,0.6001,6.5168,2.4165,1.1234,3.2572,4.3401,0.6928,2.5783,2.1055,5.3993,1.0833,1.8532,3.4181,0.6181,2.216,3.9353,3.227,4.0306,0.3929,3.1356,1.9461,1.974,1.4869,3.5838,1.9589,7.0954,1.0027,1.0118,0.0002,0.6205,0.3241,0.0002,4.217,0.9778,0.7656,0.6931,1.1752,0.401,0.7002,3.6874,0.0005,4.0864,4.5221,0.217,3.477,3.6708,1.6483,1.1501,3.5835,1.8921,2.2203,1.8535,1.7194,2.3289,3.9046,0.8051,1.6579,0.0004,3.9349,0.1913,0.1424,0.3756,0.7416,5.5794,4.7797,2.2999,2.4621,0.0277,0.3966,4.4502,0.0005,2.0547,1.5805,0.0029,1.0961,0.4864,5.9573,5.0883,0.5034,4.4106,1.9957,2.2821,0.9571,1.7064,1.5102,0.0002,2.5171,1.4679,1.2839,2.3386,0.0005,1.8629,3.1813,2.5033,2.2296,0.0053,3.2545,2.2852,4.6292,5.263,1.8974,0.3692,0.3921,0.582,0.335,4.9491,5.1285,2.5453,3.903,3.573,1.9334,0.0127,4.9335,1.9737,2.6961,0.3781,0.4988,0.0002,1.1002,0.2008,0.0002,1.3303,2.8784,5.8794,3.7432,0.196,1.6549,2.5962,2.6175,2.6766,0.0045,0.0036,1.3499,1.7797,2.1635,0.3741,0.8916,3.5461,2.3443,2.5566,0.4745,0.2743,0.5018,4.0334,1.2775,3.7727,5.0683,6.9839,0.021,0.1885,0.5333,0.1044,0.0709,0.0007,0.0625,0.4008,0.8148,0.4781,0.1155,1.5618,0.6593,0.6756,0.0866,0.1919,1.2001,1.4007,0.1073,5.8816,0.7018,1.5849,0.8076,4.7724,3.2627,2.4542,1.0544,0.9653,2.3592,1.1712,0.9599,1.8945,4.3618,4.1139,0.7551,1.25,0.3129,2.4526,3.0749,0.8646,6.0249,1.4365,0.0781,0.5865,5.3776,0.6293,1.1119,2.8653,3.2028,0.0003,1.7107,1.9293,1.4609,3.2807,2.3046,0.7577,2.2994,2.2999,0.2301,0.4896,0.7901,2.0121,2.0087,6.2062,1.6147,5.1671,2.2313,2.0804,1.9919,1.635,1.3656,0.387,3.1281,2.1246,2.7457,1.0699,5.0631,1.4204,0.9106,0.0002,1.2659,0.1423,0.0002,1.4745,0.0025,0.1155,0.0002,1.5768,0.2374,0.8694,0.9079,0.3939,0.2966,2.3868,0.0142,0.1163,0.1546,6.5667,0.3133,0.163,2.8607,0.0003,1.7534,2.7542,2.998,2.4031,0.9977,0.5965,0.278,0.7226,1.3598,1.798,4.1235,1.387,0.0002,5.3632,0.7123,0.0365,4.0961,5.0213,3.773,3.5514,1.4516,1.5713,2.0772,0.3826,1.1544,0.3239,2.4781,1.7763,0.1749,2.2583,1.8456,1.6958,0.2865,1.8336,3.9711,1.4922,5.5307,2.7126,0.9525,3.9649,5.0797,0.1138,5.4398,2.8971,2.6891,0.5809,1.0668,0.8446,3.4768,1.7712,0.976,5.575,2.5816,2.5325,5.6246,0.1728,1.2901,0.0378,0.1418,0.5405,0.0002,0.6586,0.6274,0.0002,1.6373,0.1959,1.6308,4.1439,2.1416,4.2736,0.5815,0.4315,1.7741,2.6558,2.9102,1.3547,1.9934,0.0002,3.3804,0.2218,0.0166,1.9607,0.5175,0.1682,1.6134,2.9307,0.8252,0.514,2.7742,0.6396,2.1148,0.0511,2.2977,0.0002,5.1096,3.3226,1.7648,3.4746,2.7984,0.5364,2.0808,0.0003,0.378,0.3007,1.8438,0.5306,3.0453,4.3727,2.3819,0.8723,5.4757,1.8009,0.0972,0.7765,1.6354,1.9536,3.1486,0.8708,4.3542,3.0149,4.2966,3.8726,4.4152,6.8139,1.1641,1.7566,0.2492,1.0404,0.0002,4.5873,0.109,0.2528,0.0002,1.9231,0.2978,2.7439,0.0393,1.8095,3.0496,4.4192,1.7495,1.2515,4.3387,3.6238,0.289,2.516,1.7177,0.6396,1.677,0.1539,1.4178,0.4618,0.0707]}

{"id":136,"ended":false,"length":685,"gen_text":"You own a magical camera that is similar to a thermal camera, but instead of heat it shows you value. A ring glows as bright as the sun while a piece of plastic wrapping is almost invisible. You have been careful never to look at a person with it for your whole life. You never go to sleep in the same room as it, only while it is active. You have a lot of fun with it. Its never been stolen.\n- You are a student of a magical family, but you have never studied magic yourself. You understand the value of things, and you have the power to see and sense them. Your house is always warm, you eat from the same bowl, and you have your room warm as well. The person you love has no idea who you are. You can have a very bad reputation for looking like a complete fool, with your clothes smelling like old cat urine, or your house being broken. You never have more than one friend in the group.\n- You are a noblewoman and are very powerful, but you have never heard of a woman with any kind of magic, and never have you personally witnessed anything magical happen. Your room is always cold during the winter, and you have a bad reputation for not knowing any magical creatures. You get on very well with some magical creatures, like lizards.\nOther things that your have never learned (I'm using common sense here to give the characters some space: I also will not be touching on the politics of magic, such as the \"magic systems\", \"magic nations\" etc., etc.)\n- Your magic is very powerful. Your family makes a lot of money. The magical system is incredibly advanced.\n- Your family has done this to you. Your family trained you as a witch, using extreme methods, and you have no memories of the experience. This is what they call their education.\n- You have been trained by a magical family. You have very strong magical powers, and you have never even heard of the magical society you belong to. At first you felt that you couldn't trust anyone ever again, but you started out being very trusting and now it seems like people actually do trust you.\n- You know a lot of things. You are used to seeing what others can't see: how they die, the things happening around you, the events happening in your family.\n- You know a lot of things you have never found out. The world around is very strange, and things have never been explained to you yet.\n- You know where to go. One of your family members has told you where to go. If she isn't with you, you are very strong at finding new places for yourself.\n- Many things that you have seen don't make sense. You can't really understand how they can do what they do. You need to talk to a very wise person before all of this could become interesting (not that that's a thing you want, but it is for this story.)\n- A lot of your best relationships are with magical creatures. They're very friendly and loving and you always feel like they understand.\nWhen the story begins, the main character has never heard of magic in their entire life. It hasn't affected their life, and yet they are ready to take the next step up. But is it time? Is it right? Is it safe? Or are you making a big mistake?","token_len":697,"entropy":[8.9118,1.8778,8.5974,6.8546,1.7138,3.3064,7.7723,0.1785,1.4669,6.779,0.8995,1.2101,0.6609,2.3214,0.3248,5.2337,1.0717,4.4969,1.8055,10.4637,1.0706,4.3949,7.9153,7.7984,0.044,3.8754,6.4505,0.1164,1.4156,0.3349,4.4031,1.7865,4.3628,0.0126,6.3611,10.1472,1.7284,5.4521,1.5348,0.4939,2.7847,3.1709,3.6471,8.5761,4.7593,0.0083,4.2709,1.1014,3.2583,4.7943,3.0645,1.8668,4.5555,5.9525,2.3804,0.0554,1.0408,1.7142,4.6718,5.1472,1.4807,3.5889,3.5183,1.1734,0.7396,1.382,0.3996,0.6978,1.285,4.6967,5.2601,2.0407,0.4262,4.5911,0.3042,1.4261,1.7932,2.4363,4.2636,0.1503,3.2133,1.161,0.2039,0.9436,6.096,5.1348,2.0774,2.009,1.2455,1.9749,10.6204,2.6996,1.7055,1.0291,5.0838,1.3631,3.0157,2.1965,5.0713,2.0357,2.6527,1.0297,1.8076,1.3727,3.309,0.506,3.7031,0.1519,0.7626,5.9443,1.3194,4.3553,0.1023,4.7986,1.1553,1.5448,1.208,1.9955,2.7219,2.6778,0.1315,3.3435,3.4824,4.4548,0.9746,0.3418,2.6127,5.1128,0.5153,2.0497,1.9662,1.1202,3.4933,4.042,3.6618,1.2018,0.5985,2.1065,1.5529,0.497,0.5688,2.0136,3.9221,4.6906,5.3837,2.3326,0.1715,0.0917,2.9756,5.7555,0.9756,0.7218,3.4187,3.8686,0.478,3.9472,0.1377,0.3791,0.7859,1.0598,3.5655,5.2691,1.628,3.6881,5.2969,5.5447,2.9742,5.9987,2.0488,0.3899,3.7408,2.5787,0.9596,6.1879,2.2811,3.2936,3.4019,1.0975,3.2389,3.8278,1.6448,1.218,2.8717,1.3929,3.4875,2.2196,4.0112,5.3651,1.1896,3.1645,2.3491,6.1027,0.1221,0.7776,1.9536,2.4786,1.3324,6.0581,0.7774,1.3221,0.2046,0.1258,0.6021,0.4674,5.1533,3.7421,3.1316,3.3676,2.6621,2.9227,2.0701,0.659,0.5396,1.338,0.5473,5.329,0.331,1.8811,5.33,2.4776,4.363,2.6368,0.0027,0.9753,2.8721,1.2996,3.4631,2.1882,1.3903,5.5551,3.1117,3.746,1.7885,2.8399,0.6323,2.1458,4.1144,0.4611,0.31,0.8504,6.989,0.1356,0.8644,0.5327,0.6834,0.9683,1.4514,2.1369,4.1317,1.0273,0.7817,2.9372,3.3095,3.8865,4.3271,2.8364,0.422,0.5958,5.2329,4.6343,1.343,0.2309,0.0163,4.119,2.6335,0.1172,0.5014,3.3257,5.4797,0.0611,2.2459,1.0275,7.4363,3.0428,1.6574,6.1544,5.7422,3.46,4.1831,5.2052,3.74,2.1256,4.6682,5.2168,1.0364,0.602,4.0153,4.3689,3.0032,3.8968,1.9052,4.0046,5.816,2.6535,5.5382,5.2418,0.8111,1.5948,4.2848,0.916,2.0752,5.1742,1.1301,1.5036,1.2436,3.8114,0.0134,1.3419,4.8267,3.5802,5.772,2.4695,2.8283,1.1557,5.4963,1.7096,1.3718,3.6902,3.6705,0.6987,0.3207,0.6836,2.5005,3.6921,0.8255,2.4467,1.7554,1.9893,2.8806,2.5021,6.0742,1.2157,1.0268,0.0249,0.1239,2.5887,3.3443,3.9351,4.3798,0.7729,4.6971,2.9885,0.6707,1.9145,0.4301,1.2893,0.8498,1.4898,5.6061,3.6784,3.7526,0.5076,1.7208,1.837,1.2067,6.1976,0.0833,3.2565,0.4272,2.7285,0.9935,6.7634,6.1701,1.8403,1.5862,0.9805,1.6715,1.5779,2.7702,3.7457,0.1742,2.8859,2.3467,0.3787,4.0658,0.8723,3.5708,2.6912,1.791,5.6982,5.8036,0.7047,1.0644,0.2588,0.8328,1.2198,2.4152,3.3925,1.6749,1.6504,2.3204,0.9877,1.009,1.3418,1.1742,5.2559,1.4888,1.4205,2.1643,0.7075,0.9013,1.0916,1.2832,2.8979,4.6824,1.9115,0.1113,2.4341,1.7328,3.5547,2.2289,1.3196,0.0238,0.1531,6.7471,1.8657,0.7749,4.7654,2.7392,0.9531,4.8279,0.0008,2.2471,1.256,6.0319,0.2566,0.3249,0.4029,1.5851,5.158,6.0637,3.7971,1.6197,1.9091,2.1623,2.6748,3.8527,2.0628,1.8096,3.9604,4.5182,2.7563,0.2755,0.0477,0.4747,0.4678,0.2618,0.4955,3.1118,2.1331,0.4155,0.9922,1.7349,1.8915,0.504,2.3041,5.8222,0.0173,2.7876,5.0413,2.4744,1.6167,0.164,0.7041,5.2904,3.7809,4.2445,4.7349,0.2101,3.2245,3.5269,7.0945,1.5809,0.6087,0.2812,1.3016,5.2233,2.5594,0.7268,1.4904,1.9846,1.0019,1.4405,0.2744,0.3201,2.0645,1.4102,0.1261,0.4747,0.7899,2.5031,3.1071,1.1056,5.9712,0.2279,1.5099,3.3142,2.854,3.3664,5.3951,2.4728,1.8597,1.0335,0.5147,4.765,3.7916,2.0421,0.5946,1.7212,0.3978,0.0143,5.5269,0.1366,0.6454,0.2854,0.2981,1.525,5.5109,2.2453,1.3351,1.2351,6.5547,1.1132,0.6941,1.858,0.7966,1.5615,2.057,0.0141,1.2619,0.5841,0.1356,1.5597,4.5251,5.1132,3.6747,0.0009,2.7836,0.0264,0.3775,0.5538,2.8798,2.6041,6.0277,2.1935,1.5903,4.4429,1.0475,5.2091,0.8365,0.4981,0.4856,0.2265,6.4149,1.1813,2.7948,0.9193,1.3374,2.2832,4.4281,0.0005,0.8839,0.2592,0.4282,1.3279,2.2961,0.7151,3.7265,2.0002,1.8827,3.0928,3.1245,1.0196,1.9538,0.0429,0.1464,0.7366,1.7398,5.6054,0.4859,4.1875,0.1236,2.5606,5.2353,2.5263,0.5535,3.2579,7.089,0.9789,0.1066,4.9503,3.3761,6.1227,4.9663,4.1667,1.8585,3.5579,1.4122,1.7713,4.7524,2.0394,2.9257,2.6665,1.3075,1.3731,1.6894,3.4482,3.237,1.2133,2.8655,0.1199,0.4885,4.7311,0.5666,0.0413,2.9195,6.5185,6.7524,0.9104,0.6275,2.6363,0.4995,0.3698,2.1181,4.5042,1.8354,3.1043,0.9151,5.168,2.2457,1.1565,4.199,1.5502,2.2286,1.4154,2.9916,2.9641,0.8576,6.5311,2.7282,2.3039,1.8677,0.5708,1.6822,2.2784,0.1637,2.2933,2.897,1.5885,0.1224,0.8075,3.6558,2.8331,2.2046,0.0656,0.3079,3.7935,5.7083,0.0005,4.3731,1.4236,0.4828,2.033,1.4075,3.7934,1.036,1.3872,4.4126,0.1393,2.8469,2.0272,2.3436,0.0831,6.181,1.7776,4.2225,5.1421,0.9514,5.7244,1.9305,2.1302,0.5225,3.156,0.4288,2.4093,0.3285,2.3366,0.1035,4.0229,2.2243,2.5622,4.0531,1.007,2.4981,0.2164,0.3344]}
{"id":2110,"ended":false,"length":642,"gen_text":"Something was different about you today but couldn't explain it till you were flipping though comics and realized you could reach into any well drawn picture and pull out objects in them into reality. Mj\u00f6lnir now sitting as an immovable showpiece. You immediately start to think of other pulls. Other things you could do in the real world using the magic of the Norse Gods to do them.\n\nSo then you did the mental spin and created a new set of rules. The rules were as simple as possible.\n\n1. All characters who were once of Norse mythic fame and power must join.\n\n2. The most powerful Norse Gods must participate.\n\n3. All others are here for your entertainment.\n\n4. This contest will feature all your favorite gods and legends including but not limited to: Thor, Loki, Thor: the Red Son, Hercules the Bull, The Mighty Thor, Thor: God of Thunder, Hercules, Loki, Odin, Frigga and Loki: the Halfling Prince\n\nThis contest can only be won by those who can win the most matches.\n\nI can't imagine someone getting here and winning this. Just asking. This contest is very much about having fun and playing around. A bit of competition is always good. A little competition goes a long way. Who knows who might win?\n\nTo start off you can start by checking out the new Facebook page\n\nAlso feel free to drop by the forum on the right hand side of this page\n\nYou can also write a post in the forum by clicking on the \"Write a Post\" button and then clicking on \"Include Facebook link. This will be your new account. Go over and look at the pages like Thor will only be a little more interesting when you see Thor in your news feeds, Loki and Frigga maybe a little more fun and interesting when they are posting memes on your walls and even a little more fun with the new Loki meme that I am sure many of you will love\n\nThen once you have posted a few times you will start seeing the latest posts over there. If it is just a little too much fun and you want to switch it over to Facebook start by clicking on \"New Post\"\n\nMake sure to click on \"Facebook\" at the top of the page and then clicking on \"Post a new comment\"\n\nI also do not personally have a facebook page so if you can put a link to your facebook page here and give your FB password along with the link just a heads up that we will not use it to spread the word. Just to let you know. If you are going to post, here are some things you should know\n\n\u2013 You must be an active user and have posted on our Facebook page at least once.\n\n\u2013 Your FB account must not be disabled. Facebook makes it impossible to leave a comment on all of our pages without logging out.\n\n\u2013 It is your responsibility to make sure your FB username and password are accurate, use a strong

For example, 18 is the first birthday. Other milestones are also listed by their age. For more information about the specific age of each milestone, see the official age table.\n\nPeople who are in the highest age group are typically more productive workers, making it easier to achieve milestones in your life. Additionally, as you age, you are more likely to have health problems and longer periods of sick leave. It is easier to enjoy the benefits of time off and increase your productivity when you are younger.","token_len":701,"entropy":[10.616,8.1653,3.0298,1.1595,1.3905,5.6756,6.5304,1.185,6.2594,0.0109,0.0834,1.4171,8.3454,4.6299,1.5965,1.4334,2.2082,0.8038,7.4629,4.1109,2.3042,4.024,5.2565,3.5627,2.1724,0.3709,3.4914,0.0943,0.3037,3.2015,0.3807,0.0623,3.5115,1.4561,5.6533,0.6621,0.3986,3.6007,0.2001,0.1485,4.6992,1.9838,0.0426,0.0905,3.7024,1.0447,1.5361,1.0523,0.6813,0.5629,0.0563,0.6358,0.0293,0.1163,0.4705,0.0036,0.0648,0.0109,1.0716,0.3988,0.8324,0.0038,4.3261,1.3696,2.0699,5.5705,5.1051,6.6631,2.1553,1.9786,0.9812,1.8924,2.0216,0.3024,0.0095,1.7049,0.005,0.8224,1.6409,0.0379,0.0243,0.0392,0.0518,0.0778,0.0295,0.0273,0.192,0.1171,0.0714,0.3707,0.0156,0.0274,0.049,0.0529,0.0221,0.0418,0.0209,0.1466,0.034,0.0175,0.0355,0.0206,0.0788,0.0232,0.0151,0.0135,0.0083,0.2119,1.5169,1.5932,0.0297,0.185,2.867,1.2112,1.3349,2.2372,2.7096,5.5779,0.7429,1.7333,6.5539,4.0133,3.4711,2.8744,2.5935,1.1447,4.0557,6.4118,2.2552,1.3941,2.0855,3.2683,1.6612,1.3401,0.7456,3.4414,3.5666,2.2991,1.3177,0.5341,1.2633,1.4413,0.9616,1.1752,0.5705,2.5286,2.8553,3.2845,2.5728,4.4608,4.7581,0.8793,1.1949,0.9883,2.7171,0.2207,3.0108,3.2102,3.6702,2.609,1.8413,2.8899,0.5453,2.3194,0.5315,2.2283,3.7014,3.3683,2.9256,1.8834,3.7624,1.142,0.7767,1.5363,0.1527,1.7929,0.3005,0.7895,1.0337,0.9566,2.5792,3.9727,0.3599,2.9425,0.2133,2.2278,0.6604,1.7526,0.1131,0.5963,0.2461,1.2671,1.3561,1.5564,0.8456,2.8043,0.0663,1.1011,0.1468,0.708,0.1924,0.6837,1.9946,1.9593,0.2686,4.543,0.0002,5.7481,0.6839,0.5568,6.0996,3.9655,0.5641,1.9958,1.1245,0.7196,0.048,0.3214,5.5413,0.8153,3.6759,3.3865,0.4587,1.8523,0.9433,0.3015,2.2702,3.015,0.0038,0.337,1.5717,0.7296,1.5106,0.0002,1.765,0.041,0.0757,0.0119,0.2112,5.8771,0.4549,0.6132,0.4272,0.1296,0.1071,0.0145,0.1295,0.0106,0.1734,0.0061,0.0824,0.0046,0.1121,0.0021,0.1314,0.0044,0.1439,0.0042,0.365,0.0061,1.0781,2.0907,1.3555,0.2147,3.8737,0.1302,1.417,0.0255,1.3585,0.0077,0.318,0.0056,0.3683,0.0045,0.0949,0.0034,0.8024,0.0021,0.0719,0.0017,0.1237,0.0014,0.0448,0.0038,0.118,0.0044,6.3305,5.9958,4.5144,2.7172,4.1917,1.3282,2.8737,2.2194,3.3388,2.1098,2.4515,2.0272,3.6699,4.5569,2.2285,0.9343,2.2012,4.4709,3.9512,0.8528,2.1512,0.1207,1.5807,0.1628,1.1994,0.0216,0.5135,0.0333,0.7222,0.0064,0.8253,0.0117,0.9551,0.0067,0.3286,0.0169,1.2097,0.0129,0.8384,0.0266,0.2139,0.0068,2.7058,0.008,1.2813,0.0058,0.9499,0.0042,0.491,0.0058,0.6097,0.005,0.243,0.0062,0.2093,0.0072,3.3226,1.2632,2.8558,0.3187,1.8574,3.6331,2.9539,1.3303,2.3705,2.1563,2.1162,0.1482,0.7559,0.9461,2.6603,0.3012,1.2421,0.0145,0.2565,0.008,0.1413,0.0033,2.3812,0.0029,0.1565,0.0031,0.1213,0.0016,0.06,0.0019,0.0302,0.0035,0.0337,0.0023,0.0234,0.0012,1.7748,0.0016,0.2463,0.0013,0.2647,0.001,0.4605,0.0005,0.0581,0.0009,0.0641,0.0023,0.0347,0.0037,3.2012,1.7151,0.5302,0.1285,0.2302,0.0725,0.0645,0.0436,0.0565,0.0632,0.0085,0.0177,0.0496,0.1769,0.0583,0.0043,0.0232,0.0099,0.9229,0.006,0.0461,0.0003,0.011,0.0008,0.0039,0.0007,0.0113,0.0004,0.0037,0.0005,0.0037,0.0007,0.0049,0.0014,0.0015,0.0029,0.0016,0.0013,0.0014,0.0013,0.015,0.001,0.0036,0.001,0.0047,0.0009,0.0037,0.0009,0.0029,0.0015,0.0036,0.004,0.0041,0.0027,1.3775,0.5428,0.1991,0.0241,5.6841,0.1631,0.112,3.9491,2.1426,2.7999,0.0583,3.8179,0.2247,2.5295,0.0352,1.9922,0.0047,1.2752,0.0007,0.0989,0.002,0.03,0.0011,0.0173,0.0007,0.0066,0.0007,0.009,0.0007,0.0072,7.772,1.7817,0.2443,0.4005,0.0693,0.8167,0.0331,1.2592,0.0148,3.5319,0.0027,0.4868,0.0061,0.5257,0.007,0.3208,0.0348,2.4595,2.9852,2.5705,2.153,2.0297,1.6095,1.6895,2.2517,1.6484,2.3641,1.122,1.2896,2.8994,2.7692,1.9104,4.7123,2.0775,8.4861,3.8978,1.177,0.1637,0.7139,0.0961,0.5249,0.0566,0.3476,0.0308,3.4158,2.1256,2.1382,1.8567,1.0406,3.4253,1.7086,1.389,1.9519,1.5279,1.5537,1.8424,1.3199,0.5663,0.1122,0.1218,0.0553,0.0132,0.0185,0.0045,0.0339,0.0038,0.0498,0.004,0.0556,0.0036,1.9212,1.3873,1.1631,2.1726,1.6624,2.7099,1.6308,2.3137,1.4375,2.0205,2.5656,1.7868,1.3072,1.7574,1.9078,1.5812,3.3515,1.6361,1.7751,1.344,3.4119,1.4241,0.8642,3.9037,1.9525,1.5627,2.7655,1.0667,1.5046,0.9214,3.6879,0.714,1.5524,1.6505,0.6959,4.795,0.0003,3.2369,3.3935,2.9638,5.1192,2.4913,5.602,0.4538,1.5613,3.6084,4.4515,0.8349,1.7055,0.3259,1.7037,0.5906,0.2308,1.9347,0.1616,0.0467,5.7874,1.3801,0.8951,2.9735,1.127,2.3001,4.6964,0.557,1.0064,3.7414,3.5985,3.7787,1.3014,0.9989,1.5978,1.8384,3.4167,0.2418,1.3247,1.7603,4.655,1.6928,1.9897,1.761,0.0626,0.1365,0.7128,0.5071,6.0673,3.4656,2.6217,0.579,0.3176,0.0002,4.161,1.3488,0.6857,3.8106,0.9804,5.5465,0.7487,0.2975,2.1537,3.0091,3.3332,2.4818,3.553,1.595,5.405,2.4936,0.9081,0.8102,2.581,4.0689,3.1094,1.7759,0.6626,0.3171,5.4299,0.0037,3.3533,0.4725,0.862,0.1247,0.6414,1.9614,0.7228,0.049,0.0054,1.9188,0.9174,0.6009,1.6441,5.0837,1.9221,0.2167,5.7997,0.0326,0.6108,3.6564,0.5526,5.1351,0.4773,5.697,1.9925,1.5319,0.0791,5.3272,0.3467,2.195,4.5669,0.5993,0.5678,1.5608,0.0747,0.4054,1.745,0.2756]}
{"id":776,"ended":true,"length":647,"gen_text":"It is the 5th year after the release of No Mans Sky. Hordes of aliens descend on Earth not to invade or make friends, but rather to beg for mercy and to stop sending our scouts known as `` Players '' from destroying them.\n\nNMS was in the top five selling game on Steam the day after it launched because people loved and loved it for a reason, and those reasons seem to be that it really is a new kind of space epic with an entirely new setting, characters and themes.\n\nSo after almost six years of silence and not much in the way of information, here's hope you'll all agree it's worth taking the time to do some poking around : it's always so rewarding to discover more about a game, and I think many of you are looking for that type of news with your Steam user reviews and comments. So here it is!\n\nNMS stills available\n\nIf you're looking for the latest screenshots, audio commentary and information, head over to our NMS blog page and check out what we're up to, there's so much here we could write a book.\n\nAnd of course you won't want to miss what I have to say about the game and the universe on my podcast as well!\n\nYou can also catch up with all the latest news on No Mans Sky on Twitter, where I'm @adrianversteeg\n\nWhat's in the box now?\n\nYou do have to put the disk in the optical drive first and then click install, otherwise the game's the same as it ever was.\n\nAnd that's as clear and simple as you can ask for, but it's a real shame that we're only able to give out a copy if you buy it first and then the disk is attached.\n\nThis isn't too much of a problem if you want to take your No Man's Sky to a friend or simply pass it on to someone else, where they might want to take it on to the beach on an unboxing night.\n\nHowever if it's just something where you want to show your kids you own it, you won't be able to tell him or her the install's completed, because not even the game itself shows when it's done!\n\nAlso, the installer isn't designed to be portable, which means you'll have to be careful if you're travelling with a lot of data on your hard drive, like for example with the Steam version, where the game's pretty much over.\n\nAnd if you're keen to get No Man's Sky on PC with your own language pack, you'll have to stick with this version since it's limited to English by default... if only they'd fix that after the PC version!\n\nYou do need an internet connection though, which means it's always going to suck anyway when you're playing it on your own computer where your children haven't got enough broadband to play it with them, unless you use a computer sharing service like the ones used by friends or family - and if you want to show them how you did the install by doing a tutorial session, then you'll have to use them for this.\n\nWhich really does suck, but they do at least give great terms of service - read below for some more information.\n\nThere are no refunds for this item.

{"id":1732,"ended":true,"length":658,"gen_text":"Write a horror story, but the characters have superpowers.\n\nA young girl in the year 2210 finds herself in the year 2114 when her parents have both mysteriously disappeared from her life. Her sister has been taken away to be educated, and she's now stuck trying to keep her family together while dealing with the aftermath of her parents' murder and the secret lives of all three of them.\n\nThe story takes us through three generations of people who were victims of the Great Depression, the birth of the Internet and the rise of The Matrix.\n\nA young girl in the year 2114 finds herself in the year 2114 when her parents have both mysteriously disappeared from her life. She discovers a long-lost sibling who can change into the body of a living dog, with amazing powers and abilities, but she soon learns the depths to the conspiracy that has taken them apart.\n\nThe story takes us through three generations of people who were victims of the Great Depression, the birth of the Internet and the rise of The Matrix.\n\nWhile the characters in this novel have magical powers, like the ones of the heroes in the Matrix (among other sci-fi movies), the plot is not based on some magical technology, which is common in such works. Instead, the protagonists of the story are ordinary people with similar abilities, who don't know how they found those magic powers. The book presents a world in which most people have never heard of such things, or don't know even what those kind of technologies will be like in our future. It is very easy to imagine a dystopian, post-scarcity world, where people don't need access to electricity for light bulbs, and there is little need for such things in the real world anyway. I am glad that my expectations didn't go too high, as I don't read dystopias so often, and found the novel very interesting. The plot itself is interesting and well-paced, even though it was predictable some parts.\n\nThoughts\n\nOn the one hand, this novel was surprising me. It's not a typical Sci-Fi novel, and the premise isn't something I am used to seeing in my reading, but it was written in a fresh manner. As is the trend nowadays, the author also had a good plot that has a decent amount of twists and surprise endings. On the other hand, the characters in this novel aren't real people, with special, super powers. They are simply people, people who happen to be born with similar powers. What does science fiction have to do with real world things? Is this a typical 'if it exists, believe me' story?\n\nIt all depends on how you interpret the story. Since there was no magic in this story, it's not going to be scary for everyone, but it is a good thing for people who are afraid of things like zombies and alien invasions.\n\nAll in all, it is one of the best Sci-Fi novels I read last year. It didn't impress me as much as The Sixth Sense, but as I just read two books this year, I guess it would be a disappointment if it didn't get a spot in the top 10. I am definitely interested in The Dark Forest by Sarah Stirling. It is a good read in the Sci-Fi genre, so I am quite excited to buy it on my next read.\n\nThe rating reflects the score I gave this book.","token_len":702,"entropy":[3.5497,10.1413,0.5102,2.3231,3.4928,4.7011,3.4295,2.6875,6.4068,0.1976,1.2597,1.4599,0.0095,3.9144,4.929,1.9869,3.7584,2.1856,4.647,5.0692,2.4259,2.7041,0.6074,1.4812,1.5588,1.5062,2.1145,3.6925,2.7436,2.2861,2.3229,2.902,4.3268,1.2398,0.8733,4.3674,1.1355,0.3707,0.1868,3.1925,4.2215,2.4109,1.5055,2.1901,1.6444,1.8571,2.0226,4.3634,1.6345,0.7024,1.4749,1.8472,3.2479,2.9455,3.6139,0.0093,3.4113,0.746,2.4617,0.3113,1.9617,2.503,0.0042,1.1654,4.2858,0.2033,1.3646,0.5922,0.0494,3.7318,2.5089,1.0107,5.2354,5.8174,0.2479,3.5124,4.2623,0.2127,1.3845,0.1448,0.6854,0.0002,2.1875,2.8097,2.4077,5.4533,1.8539,3.3231,1.8084,0.3214,4.7029,2.4542,3.5214,5.3642,0.0666,1.306,4.4101,2.546,1.0103,2.9906,5.1247,0.0626,0.731,2.7746,1.8681,0.4186,1.781,0.0971,5.9343,2.887,0.4019,1.2901,0.0002,3.5307,2.0564,0.8176,0.7368,0.0617,0.0122,1.5915,0.4893,0.1039,0.0059,0.0215,0.0074,0.0046,0.2312,0.2008,0.0486,0.0038,0.0063,0.0148,0.0006,0.0065,0.0215,0.0027,0.0009,0.0014,0.0052,4.348,4.3976,2.5354,5.6791,0.9037,1.0798,4.4471,2.2634,3.7704,4.342,2.1109,3.653,2.7651,0.0153,0.5738,4.5917,2.3126,1.006,5.7547,3.9922,0.7158,2.553,2.1915,2.3428,2.2658,1.8919,3.832,1.1751,2.88,5.9047,2.0731,1.9424,3.2939,1.1209,1.858,2.7644,2.2262,4.4693,0.2226,0.3416,0.0002,1.7681,0.618,0.153,0.0644,0.1597,0.1295,0.0041,0.0053,0.0411,0.0447,0.0107,0.003,0.0013,0.0415,0.0024,0.0147,0.0641,0.0242,0.0038,0.0014,0.0047,0.0093,0.0154,0.007,0.002,0.0027,0.0209,0.0008,0.0597,0.636,0.0002,6.332,1.7259,3.5903,1.8556,1.4827,3.3516,2.6411,5.7706,0.3469,0.4244,5.6891,2.2272,2.3966,3.6796,1.3951,4.2804,0.7357,0.9291,0.7844,5.3488,6.116,1.3844,3.8271,0.0153,0.0035,1.8621,0.3887,1.2541,2.4708,0.8803,2.1374,1.7873,0.1745,5.3821,3.1013,3.6537,1.9279,4.8154,1.3981,4.888,0.3016,3.222,2.1066,0.1831,1.1435,0.0906,0.6965,4.2133,2.8138,1.0418,0.7374,0.8261,2.7162,0.2739,2.5917,6.4605,1.9465,1.1993,1.333,5.754,0.0026,1.9987,2.0045,1.3718,6.3938,4.6507,6.9438,0.1966,1.0325,2.4078,3.6079,5.1752,1.1902,3.3762,1.6813,0.032,4.313,0.4917,1.1981,3.5155,0.8961,0.0974,3.4358,1.7048,1.3616,3.2084,2.3953,0.0005,1.0952,5.9023,0.9684,2.9022,6.9849,0.0046,5.1575,6.9913,0.7314,0.8714,0.9026,4.1594,1.1526,0.2146,3.3221,1.6221,4.1019,3.2209,0.232,1.2125,1.8764,2.7727,4.1257,2.2284,0.0408,2.3472,0.0002,1.5189,1.4487,0.9443,2.0288,2.5614,0.0006,0.9568,6.6301,0.0065,4.2639,4.1612,2.9441,1.4819,0.8145,2.0224,3.8806,1.0996,3.9898,0.9479,0.2892,4.0013,1.5548,2.9619,1.2855,3.1246,0.0572,5.64,0.1164,4.9762,3.7125,3.9651,0.6207,4.5292,3.8801,3.4429,0.0004,2.498,0.9415,0.9254,1.2569,2.0594,1.4192,3.7157,0.0005,6.3831,4.2039,0.2996,4.7797,0.6193,1.5101,0.8881,4.2613,1.4114,2.0901,1.4646,1.3499,0.5419,2.9033,2.7354,4.0733,0.4983,3.5667,1.5109,2.4829,0.7632,1.1196,0.2984,3.9865,0.6116,1.0437,3.7615,5.0967,5.0513,0.9769,0.663,1.5419,0.0002,5.8778,3.9174,1.1833,0.0002,6.0537,0.6563,1.6432,0.0102,0.0857,1.9931,1.4438,2.5882,5.658,2.9975,1.42,2.2186,2.8102,1.4587,1.6398,1.8061,4.6294,0.1264,0.1115,0.9479,0.615,1.2938,2.511,3.5225,4.3373,0.0007,2.5401,0.7338,3.6474,0.8423,0.0088,3.0757,0.6801,2.525,1.9384,2.6213,1.1839,1.2581,0.9593,5.6777,1.5762,0.5209,5.5583,4.5573,1.5102,4.3702,6.1267,1.8119,4.5028,2.6203,0.0992,1.008,1.5145,4.179,4.5104,1.3451,3.0906,3.0692,4.0142,5.3897,1.4655,5.0763,2.327,0.0068,0.3775,0.6038,5.4619,2.9348,0.4155,3.1394,0.0238,0.0214,0.0121,0.0222,1.0102,2.2326,1.9869,0.6021,0.5835,3.5502,0.0004,5.024,0.6733,0.679,4.9256,4.0399,5.9701,2.6418,2.3511,0.9266,1.3083,0.4552,3.1261,1.428,2.1199,5.7975,0.9611,2.9245,0.0057,1.6328,2.7954,0.3835,3.163,1.8256,0.9578,5.1774,4.3693,7.8796,0.4329,0.9913,0.0871,0.4066,0.0098,2.0085,3.4357,4.2643,0.4308,3.4546,1.7726,1.4316,5.0568,5.5667,5.1794,2.4831,4.2761,0.0727,7.8467,4.0507,0.6641,2.5044,0.3719,1.7173,0.0002,3.3904,4.9889,0.5078,0.1926,1.4051,0.486,2.1243,0.5135,1.8081,0.3151,6.0848,3.279,2.9952,0.8495,2.0082,0.9253,0.507,1.6238,0.0767,1.6312,1.9871,1.7946,4.2302,0.0124,0.6943,5.9406,2.5797,1.4983,1.3134,1.1873,1.2772,1.5761,2.4129,2.3505,3.4093,2.4347,1.9267,0.2039,1.3435,1.5279,0.0816,3.7662,0.5884,3.5816,1.3505,3.269,0.7485,0.0023,0.2733,2.085,0.0002,5.7008,0.1904,0.0032,0.038,2.4737,1.669,3.8883,0.0775,0.4716,1.2034,1.7747,0.03,0.0184,0.7208,0.2117,2.4102,3.8256,0.0634,0.5904,1.8498,5.0429,0.0003,4.4492,0.0304,1.7698,0.226,0.0783,2.3819,5.3467,2.1811,0.7212,0.5982,5.3534,2.0775,5.486,2.445,5.1512,1.7176,2.1565,0.13,0.537,0.6579,3.3068,1.4239,4.9615,0.5374,1.8879,4.9381,1.0294,1.7655,0.915,0.0002,1.959,1.0975,3.8364,1.0047,1.1685,0.4797,1.3486,0.6001,2.539,2.4725,3.1067,2.418,0.4478,5.6695,4.2179,2.4498,3.5656,4.7645,5.3079,2.6553,1.2085,2.5631,1.2681,1.4297,1.95,1.3716,4.8641,1.6465,2.9824,0.0145,0.0185,0.112,0.4206,4.042,0.8965,2.1721,4.6002,2.4208,0.4004,6.17,1.0641,3.7033,1.6464,1.2448,1.7728,0.6943,0.6002,0.0002,3.2109,3.677,6.584,2.6713,2.1655,0.2594,0.1551,2.0693,0.3235,0.2545]}

{"id":4274,"ended":false,"length":630,"gen_text":"You are Cupid. You hate your job. You are married to that annoying boyfriend. You just want everything to change.\n\nBut none of those things make up for the fact that you are the love-starved, job-hungry love-poet.\n\nEven though you make everything about love \u2014 and all of your projects are centered around love.\n\nThese are the love poems I wish I could write: poems that actually were about love?\n\nNow that's a love poem you will want to read more than once.\n\n\u2014\n\nIt's a beautiful day in New York, with birds chirping, a blue sky, and a feeling of freedom.\n\nCoffee in mugs, and beer in cocks \u2014 but also an iced cappuccino in mouth, and a glass full of wine. Love, love, love.\n\nBut the feeling is broken. The day is not the same as it was in the past, the memories in the past are gone. A new day is beginning, a new hope is beginning, but it does not feel that way. No one is smiling, even the birds aren't.\n\nI sit, staring at the screen, with the camera beside me, looking for a way to write a poem about the broken feelings and emptiness of the day. I think of the feelings I used to have, but now no longer live as they did. They are gone.\n\nThe camera feels distant. The screen is too small. It has fallen to one side. The old world stares back at me, empty and cold. The new world fills the empty spaces with light and laughter, but the empty spaces have not changed.\n\nWhat am I doing here? I turn to look at the man who has been sitting behind me on the bus the whole time. I ask. The man asks. There is laughter, and he knows it's funny, he laughs so hard that it shakes him almost as much as the bus, it makes him cough.\n\nI look back out at the subway and at the city. This isn't what I was looking for, this isn't what I expected. There are new places to see, new people to see. New faces\u2026 and I think of a song I once had, that I had to give to my friend to share with her. I'm sure she knows that I don't actually sing, it's just that people who are crazy enough to think anything they're saying is a poem think it is. It really makes me sick, how people pretend that something they don't even know about is a poem, like someone's writing a novel, not a song song.\n\nThere is laughter again. Then the man behind me laughs too. The two are laughing. This is the beauty, the miracle, of writing a thing about a thing about a thing.\n\nI turn back to the screen, sit down against the wall, look out at the city, and I write.\n\n[Cupid's Wife and

{"id":4994,"ended":true,"length":668,"gen_text":"It was when I died the second time that I realized my mistake... I couldn't control the way I was feeling, and I didn't need to because it was beyond all my control.\"\n\nWhen she was in the throes of childbirth, she said she tried unsuccessfully to hold on to those years as her future was taken \u2014 her husband wasn't aware she was planning to have another child until a few weeks ahead of time \u2014 giving her the chance to find her bearings in the new world, and find a happy one with her second son.\n\n\"I had to have a very hard thought for my future,\" she said, with a sigh. \"I know it may sound weird now, but... I'd like to be a grandmother. But it wasn't fair when he died because I gave away those years to me.\"\n\nShe is also grateful for the family she had to lose in her son's accident.\n\n\"My husband got his whole family together... he found out the day before he left for work. He was so happy to have his family there with him when he died,\" she said. \"He was really touched by all of the people who came forward. When he went, he wanted so badly to have people show there were no hard feelings. He wanted to show there was no hate, and that he respected people's decisions.\"\n\nMeading said she wanted her son's parents to be treated with the dignity appropriate to their children \u2014 but she feels many will deny that and use the death as an excuse to justify further discrimination.\n\n\"People say, 'Oh, you're so dead. It's so emotional,' \" she said. \"There's been a very long-term study I've heard that shows if you're in an accident... you lose your memory \u2014 so for someone to just say, 'Oh she's dead anyway, it doesn't matter,' it's ridiculous.\"\n\nShe is certain, however, that others would not have passed over her son because of her marriage.\n\n\"I felt the way I felt when Mya got killed,\" she said. \"I do believe people would have done what they did if it was anybody else \u2014 and I do believe they didn't have the same feelings I had. People don't want to hear that.\"\n\nAnd if they do hear it, \"if I'm ever angry about something and it's not related to the death of Mya, I'm not going to hide it,\" she said. \"One day that will have been a very, very, very sad day for me. But I'll deal with my sadness, all right? I've lived a lot of my life with sadness. Sometimes I can't even handle the simple day-to-day things.\n\n\"Mya felt a little pain that no one else in my family felt,\" she continued. \"When the funeral was over, I cried, I just couldn't get it out. It was just overwhelming to have her no longer with us, to know she was just another woman who's not here.

{"id":4902,"ended":true,"length":625,"gen_text":"New pills can temporarily release a person's dormant superpowers, but with great power comes great lists of possible side effects.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that those symptoms won't show up at some point because people have varying reactions to different medications.\n\nHere are the five worst that you should probably avoid:\n\n1. Heroin\n\nDon't make this simple mistake of trying heroin after using alcohol. The powerful effects of alcohol will quickly erase most of your memory of the entire night and can give you a rush so intense that you won't have the energy to think clearly.\n\nHeroin doesn't work that way. It will make you want more and more but you'll be tired the next morning. If you use alcohol to numb the pain, heroin takes more out of you to get away with it.\n\n2. Marijuana\n\nMarijuana is considered to be some of the best mind-altering drugs on the market and there's a reason for that.\n\nPeople have been known to develop super powers if they use cannabis. It helps with things like driving, and when combined with caffeine and stimulants, it can help people function better.\n\nHowever, marijuana use can be dangerous. People who've used marijuana recently often have some issues like headaches which will last for days, and depression may be worsened.\n\nIf you use marijuana frequently, the effects don't wear off. You're going to have the same reaction over and over again because it's harder to get high without the help of marijuana.\n\n3. Caffeine\n\nThis is one of the most common drugs that you'll find in a prescription pill bottle.\n\nCaffeine is used as a stimulant but it can be deadly if consumed in a large enough amount. An excess of caffeine consumption can lead to dangerous health issues. If you are a young person, you should limit your caffeine intake because you will not develop proper muscle control after just a few cups of coffee.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to avoid coffee or caffeine. Other commonly consumed stimulants include Xanax, Adderall, Ritalin, methamphetamine, and many more.\n\n4. Antacids\n\nThis has to rank very low on any list of dangerous drugs. When you take an antacid, your stomach is going to absorb the medication just as if you consumed it naturally.\n\nThis is why many people overdose on acetaminophen. If taking a non-prescription medication, you need some sort of antacid because you need to be able to absorb the medication easily if it's ingested that way.\n\nIf you do decide to take an acetaminophen instead of drinking a bottle of beer, you shouldn't drink that bottle of beer because that will turn your stomach into a toilet.\n\n5. Cocaine\n\nIt's been known for a long time that cocaine can be dangerous no matter how you take it. This drug is incredibly addictive in the same vein as alcohol and there's a high risk that you'll relapse.\n\nCocaine is often taken by young adults who don't know how to prevent it from becoming addicted.

He loves us also.\"\n\n\"People keep saying that in their time, a lot of people died. In the Lord's time, everything was taken except sin,\" he said.\n\nChrist also is the only person on the earth heath where he could offer up his life for others.\n\nHe's also the only one who has always loved us, he said.\n\n\"God gave us eternal life but for us to live as his sons with him, the way he loves his children: as members of his family,\" he said.\n\nA good example, he said, was the story of Paul and Silas. Both lived in the Gentile world and never became Jews. They left, and there's no record of them preaching to Gentiles until Jesus made some of the Twelve disciples his disciples. This may be the difference in how Paul preached and preached to Gentiles and how Jesus preached.\n\n\"So, the Lord has shown that he is very loving, very patient, very kind to those who die in his name, which is so important in our faith now,\" he said.\n\nAfter their death, \"God gives them an amazing life after death, and we get an amazing opportunity to see what we'll do after we die,\" as they watched the world around them change.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity and gift that Jesus gave the gospel to humanity, because he himself went and showed the way to heaven,\" he said.\n\nHe said \"the gospel of salvation and his ministry, his ministry in the world, was done through people of faith\" and is still ongoing.\n\nHe said Jesus gives us the gift of life through the cross \u2014 \"an endless opportunity of coming to him where we die, and he gives us the free will to choose life.\"\n\nThat makes faith in God something that God, through his Son Jesus Christ, offers us, something the world can choose, he said.\n\nHe gave several examples.\n\nWhen you're born, you're in God's hands. But He gives you freedom and the freedom to choose who and what you'll become, the freedom to choose to follow Jesus Christ and to live for Him.\n\nWhen we die, \"We're in God's hands. God gives us new life for this life, and that's the choice,\" he said.\n\nAnd that choice is really a matter of free will, he said.\n\n\"He's a very good creator, he's just good at creating, not so good at choosing us. God chose us,\" he said.\n\nA lot of Christians, he said, are surprised to learn that Jesus was a man and a rabbi. But it really makes sense.\n\nFor one, \"He was very much a human being, in many ways,\" he said.\n\n\"He was a man who loved men. He was a man who loved women. He loved his parents.

{"id":4444,"ended":true,"length":683,"gen_text":"A university lecture, packed with students in Evolutionary Sciences, gets hijacked by militant religious opponents, who hold the class hostage. Will you fight?\n\nIs it too late for the University of Kentucky? You can help!\n\nThe University of Kentucky is trying to keep the class hostage and has launched a full-scale cyberattack on its website, attacking the server with DDOS.\n\nThis was followed by a statement stating that they have \"no intention of using the information on the site, or allow us to continue.\" If it is true, this means that the University have taken advantage of the situation so that they can censor the class!\n\nAs a matter of fact, Professor Richard Carrier is the only student involved, the University of Kentucky administrators may have tried to stop the class, but the rest of the students agreed to do it anyway.\n\nAs the professor himself told us, \"What really goes on is that the University Administration can decide they don't like our views, they can decide the content, but at the end of the day they won't stop us from doing science! If I was the administrators and I had no choice but to stop a class, I would say, 'Well, let your students use their textbooks, but use them in a way that we decide on, and I will not agree with the content of these books.' I will do that. At the end of the day, this is an academic institution, and we are there to instruct.\"\n\nIn response to the class that the university are trying to prevent from going on, an anonymous source sent us a screenshot of a message that shows that the administrators at the University of Kentucky have made a call to arms using social media on their Facebook page. It states \"We MUST hold our own class; we MUST stop their lecture; we MUST stop their discussion of evolution; we MUST turn in any copies of the course materials we have received that were not delivered\u2026 (I'm going to make it pretty clear that I think they should be turned in.)\".\n\nThey ask if any other students could bring copies of the course materials and, if not, they are ordered to.\n\nOn their Twitter page they post the link to make sure everybody knows that they are on Facebook page, and show a page that states \"We are taking the action necessary to stop the students from going forward with their class. We have the legal right to cancel the student's classes if we choose to do so. We are not taking any additional drastic measures, but are simply announcing the legal right to do this.\"\n\nSince they have already used Facebook, if it is found that they have been behind this, then they WILL face legal action \u2014 especially since they have a very large online presence.\n\nHowever, they are not taking that chance and claim that they have done nothing malicious, \"we simply told them that we had the right to do so, and let them know that no one could force us to do anything.\"\n\nAll in the name of science, no less, if they cannot stop this class from going ahead, no matter how much they try, then they are doing it wrong \u2014 and they are definitely going to face some tough questions!\n\nIf it was up to me, I would go and ask the President of the University of Kentucky to come down to Knoxville, because that's when I will be able to bring the class down myself!\n\nPlease support Richard on his blog to find out

{"id":2227,"ended":true,"length":681,"gen_text":"Your job is simple. Keep the timeline flowing fluidly. Your job is unappreciated and nobody even knows you do it. You are a celestial `` repairman '' and you now have to go in the field for the first time ever to repair a knot in the 21st century.\n\nYour supervisor was in the kitchen when she got the call. She assumed it would be easier if she waited for you to wake up and she was surprised to discover that you had somehow fallen asleep at your computer. She quickly took over.\n\n`` How are you doing? `` said your supervisor.\n\n`` How are you doing!!! How have you done!!!? You're my co-worker?!!! We have been working together for 4 years now!! The day before yesterday you called and I had never dealt with a supervisor like you!. You gave me such the creeps! ``\n\nIt was now 9:00am.\n\n`` Your morning assignment has arrived and it is going to be extremely hard!!!! ``\n\nYou were now being summoned and you were about to fall asleep, so there was no need to get your pants down.\n\n`` I'm very sorry about this. I've noticed that you are in a lot of pain.!!! You know I have already set a few appointments for today so I thought that your pain was very important to me. `\n\n`` Ok.!!!!!! I will be working on your computer tonight so hopefully then I will be able to focus on the new appointment you have sent me. This is going to be very hard but I'm sure you will hold me accountable.!!!``\n\nShe asked you a couple of questions, and you replied.\n\n`` Is there anything else?!!! I need to talk to you about my appointment!!! If I don't talk to you in this moment then my time at my desk is over!! ``\n\nLater, she told you that your assignment would be very important to her so she would call you if you felt that you couldn't complete it.\n\n`` Ok. I will call you back when I can complete my task!!!! ``\n\nYou went into your computer and finished your task. Then, you made your next appointment at 11:30am the following day.\n\nNext time you make your appointment, you will do it as you originally planned it.\n\nYour supervisor will be waiting and he is going to give you a hard time and you are just a robot doing your job.\n\n`` Well I thought we settled that over the weekend!!! I'm surprised that you are still working as hard as you are today!!!!!! ``\n\nDon't worry. What you have going on is that you are really stressed out about your job and you need something to give you stress relief.\n\n`` I can understand that! But when I am stressed out there's nothing like having a big dose of marijuana. It calms me,and I can fall asleep a lot easier.

{"id":1255,"ended":true,"length":693,"gen_text":"You used to be the most powerful evil overlord humanity has ever seen. Then you turned over a new leaf, and your empire is a utopia. The only person who refuses to believe you've changed? The hero who has tried to stop you for decades. \"\n\n\"What are you talking about? I've never had any issues with you because of my past. I have been doing this since I was a teenager. My life was ruined by a war that wasn't worth fighting in the first place. My life has been ruined before this event and I have nothing to show for it, so fuck what he's talking about.\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\nHe sighed, turning back to the door with his chin in his hand. \"I suppose you have a point there. But it's hard to tell, with your personality. Maybe what you want may be more beneficial than what you actually expect, and your expectation is a reasonable one. If you wish to see the truth though, go ahead and find it your self, otherwise, you'll find yourself trapped in your own delusions again. I know you have to get through this, so I'm helping you see it. I promise. I can even help you change things and make it so that not as much suffering happens, like I did. But it won't be easy. No one can change the past completely, but through the effort of your own thought, will power, experience, and will may be your own reality. \" At his words, I was suddenly reminded of my friend.\n\nHe opened the door and stepped aside for me to pass through. The two of us watched the others out of the corner of our eyes like two lost kids, and he took my hand as we stepped off the steps and entered the elevator. The elevator was empty, but our door was open and the floor was cold. I could see a little light from where the elevator was parked in case I didn't want to go around in the storm.\n\nHe led me through the dark halls, the dark lights illuminating us as we headed out into the middle of the day. It was late, nearing noon, and the streets were deserted. The darkness did not escape me though, it was like the darkness itself kept us company. I could feel the air around me, the sound of traffic. The only lights were on in a few establishments. We reached our destination before dark fell again.\n\nHe opened the door for me and I stepped through, letting the world fade away to white. I had to let him go first, I had to go. He kept his eyes, locked onto mine, the only part of me left in the world. I reached out and took his hand and they both held onto each other and we entered into a white void again.\n\nI saw the end of my friend, all of his hair had been chopped off and his skin was covered with scars, and he was lying alone in his chair. A few crumpled photos were scattered around the desk, with his face and arms and legs cut off like so many pieces from the old TV set.\n\nHe stood up and took a couple steps towards me. \"Oh, how I hate this place.\" He said, in a very subdued voice as he reached out for me. He put his hand on my shoulder and started crying. I hugged him and he hugged me back.

{"id":1558,"ended":true,"length":693,"gen_text":"You used to be the most powerful evil overlord humanity has ever seen. Then you turned over a new leaf, and your empire is a utopia. The only person who refuses to believe you've changed? The hero who has tried to stop you for decades. \"\n\n\"What are you talking about? I've never had any issues with you because of my past. I have been doing this since I was a teenager. My life was ruined by a war that wasn't worth fighting in the first place. My life has been ruined before this event and I have nothing to show for it, so fuck what he's talking about.\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\nHe sighed, turning back to the door with his chin in his hand. \"I suppose you have a point there. But it's hard to tell, with your personality. Maybe what you want may be more beneficial than what you actually expect, and your expectation is a reasonable one. If you wish to see the truth though, go ahead and find it your self, otherwise, you'll find yourself trapped in your own delusions again. I know you have to get through this, so I'm helping you see it. I promise. I can even help you change things and make it so that not as much suffering happens, like I did. But it won't be easy. No one can change the past completely, but through the effort of your own thought, will power, experience, and will may be your own reality. \" At his words, I was suddenly reminded of my friend.\n\nHe opened the door and stepped aside for me to pass through. The two of us watched the others out of the corner of our eyes like two lost kids, and he took my hand as we stepped off the steps and entered the elevator. The elevator was empty, but our door was open and the floor was cold. I could see a little light from where the elevator was parked in case I didn't want to go around in the storm.\n\nHe led me through the dark halls, the dark lights illuminating us as we headed out into the middle of the day. It was late, nearing noon, and the streets were deserted. The darkness did not escape me though, it was like the darkness itself kept us company. I could feel the air around me, the sound of traffic. The only lights were on in a few establishments. We reached our destination before dark fell again.\n\nHe opened the door for me and I stepped through, letting the world fade away to white. I had to let him go first, I had to go. He kept his eyes, locked onto mine, the only part of me left in the world. I reached out and took his hand and they both held onto each other and we entered into a white void again.\n\nI saw the end of my friend, all of his hair had been chopped off and his skin was covered with scars, and he was lying alone in his chair. A few crumpled photos were scattered around the desk, with his face and arms and legs cut off like so many pieces from the old TV set.\n\nHe stood up and took a couple steps towards me. \"Oh, how I hate this place.\" He said, in a very subdued voice as he reached out for me. He put his hand on my shoulder and started crying. I hugged him and he hugged me back. I took his hand and we walked back to the car, back to our lives.","token_len":713,"entropy":[7.494,0.4064,1.0482,2.5661,3.592,2.5406,6.838,5.4011,0.2391,9.359,1.1188,0.0416,0.936,0.8303,3.1061,0.7431,3.7191,4.8703,0.8412,0.096,0.0161,1.899,1.1073,4.451,3.5206,1.3812,4.3558,6.9626,0.0027,0.8093,3.6283,2.5603,4.8703,1.2545,6.4847,0.0873,2.4411,1.546,3.7225,0.832,5.8691,2.0187,5.366,1.512,3.8013,5.3537,0.2251,1.905,0.0415,2.6233,2.915,0.5109,5.8022,1.5804,0.0052,1.9558,6.0147,2.8003,0.1735,1.4448,0.0077,0.701,1.4046,1.9579,1.3066,3.5764,1.75,4.2074,0.183,1.517,5.9655,1.7452,1.8366,3.753,0.8088,1.5434,3.5949,3.476,3.8469,1.9745,3.0474,0.7933,0.1398,0.8802,3.5688,0.9468,4.4811,3.0267,1.9479,2.254,1.2178,2.709,3.9243,1.5989,4.5764,0.0007,4.5232,0.6865,1.6625,0.0806,0.0086,0.0014,0.6803,3.5572,3.2152,1.9474,0.5117,1.7193,5.9889,4.1792,6.1357,3.8203,1.0436,2.8034,3.2175,0.2818,1.9803,0.032,0.0328,3.8019,2.2571,6.004,4.9423,5.3739,2.0437,2.8065,0.0179,1.1646,0.3031,0.0002,4.9892,4.7999,0.0533,0.0048,0.9682,1.8818,0.0002,3.8474,2.5174,1.8525,4.8922,1.9258,0.1539,0.7347,4.5435,4.3163,1.5605,5.5199,1.7814,0.0254,0.323,0.2311,0.6935,1.817,3.8793,1.3943,2.5593,1.1354,0.033,2.4704,0.5423,2.2023,3.0181,0.7474,3.7205,0.2806,3.1094,3.3733,3.9094,2.4557,3.4865,0.6679,4.0143,5.7927,0.9773,2.6795,7.5683,0.8916,2.9962,5.2536,1.5141,0.0802,1.0936,3.4989,6.1011,3.0954,1.5745,3.8384,5.5443,1.3201,3.2417,4.6219,0.2174,0.8167,3.1061,0.7377,5.3199,0.4394,3.5293,1.577,3.1021,4.4807,0.1736,4.2221,1.9866,0.7071,3.911,0.1719,6.9852,0.8773,2.2827,5.881,1.8661,1.7291,1.3832,4.029,1.1374,3.7519,0.4634,2.4571,0.4369,2.5076,4.2458,1.3558,2.1637,3.1508,1.7653,2.6793,3.5741,3.2363,3.1101,0.6824,1.0228,2.464,1.4853,1.9502,5.9244,0.4662,5.5014,1.3775,1.7695,1.933,3.7096,2.3304,1.6983,3.1864,2.7902,1.7205,0.2167,4.0759,4.0099,5.1659,1.6599,1.8286,2.35,1.5336,5.7677,3.4148,0.6218,2.5246,1.4643,1.76,5.5535,1.7419,1.345,1.0456,1.8793,2.3048,2.0444,0.0002,0.2916,0.2369,1.2969,4.9177,1.1189,1.1075,1.1472,1.3197,0.6695,6.2201,0.8443,2.5482,6.5067,2.4433,5.3477,0.8518,2.4543,0.4061,4.7658,0.7145,5.4285,3.2868,0.2863,6.9199,0.4047,0.2683,3.964,7.4861,2.1505,4.7228,3.9582,5.7857,0.936,2.2551,8.898,3.6416,0.7235,0.1142,0.6506,3.2046,2.7226,2.7373,0.182,2.0856,4.9324,1.4695,1.3719,0.0002,2.7284,3.2438,0.0605,0.0494,1.1073,1.813,4.2861,3.09,0.0904,0.7753,1.5056,1.1966,0.3752,2.9522,4.7978,0.3239,0.0262,6.0024,1.2192,4.8727,5.3461,0.4749,0.1109,0.3728,0.0019,0.1258,0.1243,6.637,3.1093,2.8244,3.1012,2.0032,3.0407,4.5917,3.7132,1.6849,0.197,2.3705,0.4523,2.1703,4.4144,0.5467,4.7924,1.7604,4.3101,0.3254,3.4094,0.2107,2.3851,2.2174,1.8912,3.4733,0.9361,1.8869,5.2053,5.4275,0.8854,1.9503,2.0509,2.056,4.2153,0.7671,2.5286,0.6227,1.7192,3.1707,2.7914,2.6584,4.5377,1.7284,1.5092,4.2999,1.4028,1.3723,1.4287,1.9066,2.2824,7.7104,2.8178,4.2135,0.0005,1.5089,0.0326,2.3189,6.5108,2.9173,0.2702,6.6737,0.5407,0.854,0.0002,2.8201,1.913,0.1532,2.651,0.3283,1.843,3.1682,1.7035,2.5955,4.3226,6.0978,2.9101,3.5438,1.2133,0.2306,5.15,4.4561,1.4609,0.1192,4.9028,0.0119,0.4159,4.6579,0.2073,2.9633,0.4072,4.4612,1.3608,6.3025,3.6658,0.7544,0.4982,0.9168,2.2872,0.2034,2.2802,0.4639,1.8607,5.1991,5.548,1.3572,4.9243,1.6336,1.4696,0.5,3.3033,1.0117,2.2801,2.5047,2.1157,3.8945,6.379,2.8641,3.2346,0.3356,1.7294,1.714,1.3496,0.8829,4.1408,2.0626,0.39,1.8871,1.3905,4.8623,0.153,3.9447,3.7861,1.81,3.608,5.1489,1.3363,2.5474,1.0608,3.0893,0.4522,5.638,2.225,2.9074,3.457,3.1952,0.0269,4.5013,3.956,2.5391,2.9402,0.6048,0.5623,0.0003,2.6118,2.383,0.2249,0.1187,1.4977,0.0485,0.7791,1.2651,1.1297,2.2632,1.1746,4.1449,1.0635,5.2237,2.1529,0.8694,2.7679,3.3168,0.6331,1.6833,3.7973,1.7519,4.2403,2.5899,3.0356,2.2081,1.0645,1.7854,1.8211,0.35,3.9383,2.5138,2.4287,5.7688,1.4331,1.371,7.1191,3.2606,1.5081,0.3823,0.9807,3.3089,1.813,3.8771,0.1555,0.8498,4.0659,2.6749,0.5758,0.5741,0.2526,1.1451,4.1879,0.743,1.1494,1.2852,0.414,0.0585,2.3687,5.4044,2.096,5.4933,1.9306,0.2669,0.019,3.6733,2.3952,3.7845,2.4987,1.484,3.796,1.5552,6.1779,0.2065,0.7167,0.0002,1.7485,4.7828,1.7077,4.0526,0.3654,2.6002,2.1321,2.1165,4.9311,1.5387,0.7723,3.8091,2.1659,1.1591,3.3218,0.0663,1.2373,1.2716,1.5178,1.1568,3.0863,1.9449,1.0513,1.8815,2.8572,1.5816,0.8081,2.2484,5.275,1.0088,2.5884,3.8864,1.1751,3.2514,2.926,5.9383,1.0544,0.0123,5.0941,1.5669,1.358,0.9603,1.0752,4.0483,0.8911,4.3031,2.1982,1.9611,2.8621,3.4189,4.0515,0.5742,3.6609,0.672,3.616,3.2722,0.2775,2.5492,4.6439,2.915,4.1741,3.6351,2.02,0.2775,2.0178,0.0002,1.9881,4.4582,0.3994,0.9569,3.6307,0.6269,3.726,0.8314,1.293,0.2468,1.1705,1.7466,4.8987,1.0439,5.0168,1.2963,3.2593,1.9853,1.0533,1.9593,0.6973,1.0578,1.1621,5.0851,0.524,3.5601,4.0168,0.3137,4.8443,0.7124,3.4323,0.8124,2.1413,0.2653,0.2439,2.446,3.5621,0.2762,0.7514,0.3848,0.2703,0.5082,0.5852,4.4002,4.4816,0.4881,1.6509,3.74,0.0406,1.9164,1.873,3.0054,0.0872,0.0411,0.8292,1.8502,4.4551,0.9224,0.1328,0.3979,0.8549,0.9976,2.313,0.7072,0.6382,2.2392,1.285,4.4628,0.3182,1.7029,1.6792,0.5743]}
{"id":2284,"ended":true,"length":692,"gen_text":"Every direction is North, South and West. If the players ever find their way into the tunnels to the south-west of the city then things are going to get hairy.\n\n- The first stage is the most straightforward of the campaign. In it, we start out in the tunnels of the northern half of the city. This is where the players are most likely to encounter other races. There is a large lake between North and the southern mountains. The lake has a lake monster with two heads which will attack the party. There is also a small village on top of the mountain to the west with a river running through it. If any one of the characters manages to make it up to the top of the mountain then they will have to venture into the deep caverns to the south-west to deal with the undead that run rampant up there. It's there that the party will also encounter the giant who controls the caverns of the city.\n\nWhile there may be some room for adventure in the deeper parts of the city, the party will certainly have to deal with the large lake monster from earlier (we'll refer to it as the monster of the lake), the undead, and the giant. The rest of the adventure will consist of encounters with the undead and their minions, the lake monster, and the giant. The monsters associated with this second stage are the Lake Monster (a huge red, bloated green fish), Sea Skeleton (the skeleton of an actual sea creature) and Sea Lion (two-headed sea lion).\n\nThe second stage, then, is the least dangerous of the campaign. The players will likely return to the surface of the water after a little while and have the opportunity to visit the tavern located near the lake. Although the tavern is still bustling with activity, the party is allowed to rest in the center of the square. After a little while, the player's boat will arrive at the city's docks.\n\nThe final phase is the most complicated. If the party manages to defeat the undead from stage one they will enter the city of the undead and the city itself will begin to crumble. As the undead enter the city, the city itself begins to crumble. When this is done one of two things will happen. Either the living will join with the undead minions battling to take over the city and the city will become more and more infected with the undead's powers or eventually, the city will fall.\n\nIf the city falls then the player's group must then either take a boat to the shore and sail back to the city, or travel north again and follow the northern wall of the city. Depending on all of these things, the group will also have the opportunity to venture into the undead parts of the city to look for treasure or battle their way through the undead hordes to the city's center. At this time the party will have to face new challenges from the undead. They will need to find a way to kill the creatures that make up the \"City of the Spiders\" and then they will have to deal with the final two giant bosses, known as Giant Worms and Giant Centipedes.\n\nAfter all of the city has fallen your group might want to visit the docks where they will have a chance to rest and enjoy the sights. This is the final stage where the character will likely be joined on their journey back to the capital. This time the players will have a chance to visit the capital with some help from the king who can guide your players through the city's interior.","token_len":714,"entropy":[9.044,2.1272,8.4532,1.4489,0.8229,2.4045,1.0327,0.797,4.3228,2.7615,5.6603,5.1706,3.1055,3.0396,0.113,3.0513,0.679,5.02,4.5114,0.3384,2.7494,2.7609,0.7055,2.368,0.3623,2.4366,4.5193,4.6952,2.8087,1.0641,0.0555,0.1988,4.4383,0.4302,1.0105,0.0285,5.7555,2.2834,4.4601,5.8466,2.2683,1.9709,3.4719,2.268,2.5438,0.4919,3.8412,0.9579,3.7471,2.3937,1.2129,3.2439,3.7074,2.558,1.4687,0.6647,4.0648,2.1714,0.6663,4.8856,3.0697,0.0451,0.2239,0.2139,1.2814,2.948,0.7657,1.2201,0.7846,2.1428,2.577,2.7464,0.1105,0.0273,1.2772,4.6167,3.3777,1.3603,2.8207,1.5909,0.8551,2.9531,5.2192,3.6493,6.6925,0.4947,3.1067,3.2492,5.9918,1.502,1.6175,1.8071,2.7637,0.9507,4.2898,1.7453,4.4214,3.7757,2.6361,3.2393,2.4185,1.5026,0.9085,1.5726,1.7915,2.1233,0.5507,0.6392,0.286,3.3075,3.5541,2.3817,3.063,0.015,0.4806,0.6554,2.8536,0.0212,1.7724,3.8566,0.5915,5.2082,1.2233,0.346,0.1467,0.2484,3.6054,4.7082,4.8226,0.2102,0.2681,1.9561,3.5969,0.0056,3.01,0.1119,3.1319,1.031,0.1349,1.1408,0.2978,0.0495,0.0463,1.0569,0.5581,0.5895,1.9273,0.8355,5.2231,1.2616,0.0987,4.6966,3.0787,0.2408,1.5399,0.5266,0.9655,0.7098,0.1028,2.3343,3.66,0.0009,0.5543,5.0205,2.8218,5.4981,1.322,3.5886,0.0628,0.0592,4.291,1.5723,4.988,0.3082,0.646,1.5154,0.5581,2.8332,1.586,0.8167,4.2546,5.4766,4.1971,0.139,2.873,0.23,4.523,0.2072,2.3209,0.3382,0.8814,0.0002,6.7141,2.9864,4.5734,0.3605,1.812,5.7451,0.1919,2.9203,0.8726,0.4656,5.8529,1.3232,0.0262,0.0509,0.4723,0.3097,1.0666,2.4897,0.8626,5.4693,1.355,0.2279,1.4144,0.0028,0.8312,5.6855,4.1914,0.6355,5.0491,2.9169,5.1091,5.1956,1.0876,5.1458,0.0151,0.5735,0.165,0.5795,4.124,1.8979,0.2724,0.1898,2.8396,0.9372,0.7395,1.2962,0.4416,0.5068,1.876,0.863,1.9088,5.1338,0.0312,0.0555,3.138,0.8626,3.4632,0.0564,4.6602,0.4421,1.0632,1.9288,1.3154,5.5466,2.2227,1.4911,1.5585,1.7249,0.0674,0.2792,0.2749,0.5448,0.8823,0.2753,2.1336,3.0217,6.2933,0.0122,2.3144,4.907,0.3926,0.8318,1.4703,4.9403,2.1502,2.1075,2.981,3.6825,5.3464,3.3889,4.5078,4.7009,3.0525,1.3185,6.2781,5.5924,0.2,0.2376,4.0806,2.4802,0.1694,2.2228,5.5545,0.7129,0.6856,2.6171,0.1292,3.5165,5.7784,0.3442,5.0056,3.5666,0.1456,0.9258,0.225,0.36,0.8055,0.0002,1.6806,2.451,0.286,3.9225,4.3755,0.0363,0.948,1.6676,4.1551,2.2044,0.9408,0.0632,1.1971,0.4244,1.3681,2.247,0.5107,3.2789,6.68,0.1548,0.1558,2.4684,2.0579,0.0656,2.8091,2.5708,2.5193,5.075,0.8642,1.5223,3.3711,2.9705,1.0281,0.0272,3.8397,0.3743,4.7297,4.4281,3.4476,0.075,2.1611,0.5977,6.2491,1.097,1.6323,0.9243,4.1034,5.7204,0.6927,0.4901,0.3526,1.0737,1.6076,2.795,5.5413,0.2033,1.8069,2.2068,0.4396,5.8122,0.1331,0.3412,3.8714,1.3272,3.8533,1.1285,2.6406,0.5054,0.4712,0.7281,4.2927,2.7171,5.1204,0.1935,2.1007,1.146,0.2056,2.9815,1.4556,0.6067,0.7146,1.5459,0.0002,1.3198,3.857,3.6076,2.1612,0.6184,1.0354,4.0215,1.4259,3.8729,0.3576,1.3899,0.8543,0.0053,3.5224,0.1702,2.443,4.9315,3.4688,0.4244,3.3946,0.2224,3.6581,0.2575,1.752,2.4785,2.3087,2.6365,2.2925,2.4651,2.5456,2.5426,0.6031,2.9261,0.1319,2.1076,0.6503,3.3064,0.564,1.3844,5.3711,0.0726,0.0741,0.9741,1.5105,1.1796,2.1055,1.3802,0.0374,1.0327,0.585,4.4933,2.4147,3.4294,1.14,7.5719,0.4064,0.5461,0.0211,0.2761,0.1727,0.5438,0.8956,0.2042,6.455,1.0743,5.5522,2.0294,0.0582,0.3711,6.9179,7.4339,3.1209,1.632,0.9693,0.0723,0.1081,2.33,1.2196,0.9671,0.4094,2.0413,5.5318,0.8373,0.0011,4.4058,0.9172,0.6798,0.4269,3.1789,3.1227,1.0882,5.9446,2.6488,0.4564,1.0321,0.2531,2.5547,2.4034,1.1437,0.0002,2.5029,0.2781,1.5624,0.5948,1.6587,0.4516,3.5959,0.2417,4.1243,4.332,3.3095,5.1389,4.1251,3.0071,1.2182,0.8621,0.4182,3.2938,1.1438,2.458,2.1272,0.234,0.3636,1.6506,2.1531,0.4861,3.7228,2.9089,5.1266,1.5874,4.1461,0.0829,4.1886,3.7774,0.6037,0.0258,0.0971,1.0225,4.8642,0.0728,8.472,0.7495,2.319,1.5547,0.6785,0.3598,3.1088,0.7511,6.5498,1.2108,2.1026,0.5186,0.0237,4.34,0.6816,0.1393,5.6356,6.2475,0.0176,0.0327,0.05,2.4022,5.402,0.0617,2.8567,1.6267,5.7455,3.4554,0.036,0.6968,0.3612,0.6026,2.6657,1.9001,0.7775,2.4761,0.3688,1.7812,0.288,4.5659,1.306,3.1505,1.1284,1.716,0.4455,1.4287,0.8871,2.2369,7.105,2.1491,3.8538,0.2921,0.1642,1.7133,2.5251,0.4994,3.509,0.0373,3.287,1.4194,0.1832,0.164,3.1447,0.3318,5.129,1.0569,4.4974,0.0668,0.1059,5.7583,4.1505,0.8147,0.201,7.8961,0.149,0.5497,1.0585,2.7209,2.2655,0.3362,0.933,0.1584,1.9582,0.0024,0.2407,4.8227,5.166,4.2548,1.8441,2.6578,5.4927,0.0942,4.2976,3.3207,0.3545,0.3134,0.5234,3.5766,0.0038,0.091,0.129,0.6288,0.0002,3.7362,2.0859,0.3507,1.7465,4.42,1.308,0.1924,6.9806,1.412,5.1736,3.5195,0.0115,2.9551,0.2333,3.5002,3.6617,1.0661,0.963,1.9365,2.0675,0.3417,0.0327,1.1723,0.9897,4.828,0.6623,2.214,2.0974,3.5223,0.6663,1.7723,2.96,1.8483,3.8659,0.6234,4.8924,1.6628,4.1494,2.194,5.0163,5.5704,1.0878,0.4574,3.1871,0.2238,0.1794,4.5157,2.3061,3.6364,3.2996,1.2744,2.4885,0.2553,1.0072,1.722,0.4534,0.0157,1.9437,0.2747,2.702,4.7453,3.3493,2.7571,0.2016,0.8634,4.1791,3.2801,4.0371,3.71,4.6095,1.9837,0.8393,0.2138,0.7297,2.7583,4.0949,0.5305]}
{"id":2557,"ended":true,"length":697,"gen_text":"All this time, God has meant well but is very clumsy. Everything he does to help us seems to backfire horrendously. Today, he makes himself known just to say that he is giving up and letting us take our own course. The very next day... he takes over again. He is now doing all the work. The day after that he says he will leave us all alone.... Well, how ridiculous has the whole situation become? I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I have never seen anything like this. How do you think things will unfold and when the inevitable crisis will occur? Will the media and authorities have enough patience to watch all this? What happens next is completely out of our hands. The problem will always be there, with us or with the authorities. I am sure there will be some way to resolve the crisis with time. A few of us have been calling this time the Age of God, the \"Last Battle\". I am sure our numbers will increase significantly. But we also are aware that it will be the largest, most significant catastrophe since the end of the Civil Contingencies in the 1970's.\n\nWe have seen so many of the key players. We have seen what is meant for each of them by this. We feel confident that those who have the real resources will make the right choices for their survival. Others might be influenced by fear, the false hope of the moment and the false promises which will lead them into self destruction. In the end, we have to put our trust in the Lord God Almighty and trust in his plans. We are all the same at the end of days. Everyone is at the end of this life or the next. There are no moral distinctions for us at this time. Those who are the very ones that will bring God himself down and ruin the whole world will deserve what they get in the end. I feel very confident at the end that we will all have the right to choose our own fate. We will not do it in any way that we see as immoral or immoral that those whom we trust most will not be allowed to be our guardians. Our lives will be our own, after all, and this is God's plan for us. I believe this will help us to gain a better understanding on how God's plan actually works.\n\nAt the very least, we can now understand that we do not have to take all the blame. He can still turn us around and ask us what we can do now for ourselves and our families. He has the power. We are all in this together. The future is now in our hands. As we prepare for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ it is important to not be afraid to ask for help when needed. What does our family think about this? Should we accept this plan from God himself without our families' support and advice? Does it make any sense for our family to accept such an enormous burden?\n\nIf you want to know more about this \"End Times\" plan, check out the YouTube channel of Pastor Jack Hayford, the Pastor of The Church of All Nations in New Hampshire, who has been the one spreading this information for over a year.\n\nThis is my prayer request.

{"id":750,"ended":false,"length":714,"gen_text":"You're walking down the street and bump shoulders with someone. It's you. You're standing in a crowd. The person you passed looks at you and says, 'Hey! That's my friend!'' That is the way that everyone reacts in public, he said. When you interact with people in those situations, your brain automatically identifies you and knows it's you. The more people see you in public, the more they have to react to you and the more they start to identify with your body, he said. The person you passed has no idea who you are. \"So he thinks, ''I had better talk to this guy, see if he's okay,'' which is very normal,\" Mr. Blasdel said. \"What can happen is the interaction with the stranger makes you feel more alert and focused, which then makes you feel more conspicuous and visible than you were before. As soon as there's someone in your peripheral vision, your attention drops, so you're more inclined to stay in your environment. ''It's a vicious cycle and when you feel that your situation is a lot more visible, you're going to be motivated to act accordingly.'' He said the way people react varies from one individual to the next: Some feel threatened by a stranger, and feel threatened even when they do not. At the same time, the reactions don 't vary with the size of the group of people at hand. At large gatherings, people act the same. As Mr. Blasdel notes, large gatherings like a concert can be a place that people want to go; large groups are places where people feel uncomfortable. But at smaller gatherings you don't feel as surrounded. \"We find that at the smaller a gathering size, where the group size is smaller, people have a lot less sense of vulnerability,'' he said. On Facebook, you see that the large group of people will not hesitate to share it with their close friends and acquaintances, and with strangers. \"With that wide group of people that will come together, sharing the experience, sharing their own reaction... it's a shared experience,'' he said. \"The group is a lot more open. It's a group of people who feel safer and are in a more comfortable situation.'' He notes one notable difference between Facebook and real life. ''Facebook has a real-world dimension,'' he said. ''People really want to be liked.'' Even though we all live in the same world, he noted, we are all different in our level of sensitivity to that world. Some individuals are easily annoyed by the comments that others leave, and so they ignore the offending comments. But others need to talk back. Even though the comments may seem obnoxious, that same individual is also going to react to them in a different manner. ''At the end of the day, most of the comments are not intended for a specific audience but for a group of people,'' Mr. Blasdel said. ''People do not need to have a specific group in mind in order to read them as an insult.'' He noted that many of the criticisms that people express on the Internet are not intended as such. ''People would be much less likely to react on the Internet,'' he said, ''if your primary audience were your peers.'' People who are sensitive to the things that a given group of people leave in comments, Mr. Blasdel said, may ignore them or be offended. ''It's part of the power of the crowd,'' he said. ''The bigger the audience, the more powerful your reactions are.''","token_len":716,"entropy":[2.1942,6.7314,1.7276,0.3343,0.3245,1.0157,7.2966,9.2521,0.0708,1.8923,2.0625,3.1876,0.5359,5.5704,1.5553,1.4645,1.661,4.0235,1.8348,2.1676,1.632,1.2707,3.6014,1.8736,1.1156,6.1267,3.5287,1.5381,0.0452,1.2959,1.5696,0.4818,1.4066,2.0773,2.608,2.6851,0.3784,1.5398,1.6116,2.1699,6.9439,3.621,3.5594,1.778,3.7748,2.7422,5.5786,4.0287,3.1699,3.7587,2.252,6.1624,0.6564,0.0565,4.9088,1.4196,5.1315,0.2326,2.1081,1.0987,6.4748,0.8348,0.1102,2.5162,0.9919,3.2892,4.7537,1.676,2.2107,4.6648,3.3195,0.2864,0.0548,0.5819,3.2696,3.7194,2.4211,4.102,0.1446,2.9349,1.7234,0.1078,0.072,0.2905,1.7665,5.3422,0.8522,3.4189,0.8563,0.1388,2.712,0.8178,0.4218,1.0021,4.2898,0.4193,2.8152,2.0453,3.5474,2.2579,1.9369,1.0475,0.0945,0.0145,3.6986,4.5275,0.9924,1.8415,3.9903,2.1091,0.5268,2.538,0.1094,0.0379,0.8309,2.0945,3.4495,4.3898,3.9995,0.7008,5.6558,2.0551,5.6601,2.8922,3.3734,0.0633,1.7251,0.9357,2.3991,4.6976,0.5365,0.43,0.8677,1.7193,1.7455,4.5379,0.8461,4.0303,3.2096,1.833,4.6888,0.0132,5.7861,3.5754,3.8856,0.0981,0.0338,0.9249,4.0942,5.5034,1.8169,0.4724,2.5276,5.3118,3.4647,1.0406,1.232,4.1949,0.9119,0.7757,1.6522,5.7458,1.1305,4.7989,1.3921,1.6727,3.3242,1.54,0.178,1.2847,0.7997,6.3171,1.6244,4.6153,6.299,0.5376,2.6157,0.2071,1.5797,5.1644,2.2607,0.006,5.4086,0.4386,3.4213,2.5504,1.9628,1.0992,0.092,0.363,1.6037,2.6339,5.9036,2.4566,2.7282,0.6839,1.6906,1.6227,4.6583,0.0171,5.2974,1.215,1.2929,3.5185,2.2496,3.3518,2.6981,0.3369,1.6474,2.3076,0.3875,5.2688,5.1055,0.7282,4.1318,2.7597,2.5132,4.7099,0.3072,3.8807,2.3652,0.4132,2.0595,0.7626,0.7687,0.9874,2.3742,0.0041,1.1426,6.5249,0.0631,2.8692,5.1315,1.6998,3.7624,0.8133,1.8986,4.4305,1.749,1.7113,6.5331,1.268,2.6351,2.8261,0.0124,0.6954,0.0873,5.3289,0.7453,4.2492,3.7595,1.4576,2.2163,0.347,1.0859,2.7969,3.4668,4.1146,2.8866,2.6974,0.4296,4.7072,0.1355,2.256,6.4033,0.5154,0.5784,0.0021,0.0416,3.581,5.5275,4.8255,11.0789,0.0375,3.7326,3.1377,1.251,3.0516,0.0871,0.1944,2.628,4.4909,0.2204,5.0285,2.7457,0.5112,5.7755,3.1777,0.6436,0.1822,1.1185,4.2161,2.5592,0.0898,1.6716,4.9396,1.7211,0.0019,0.0668,0.0015,0.002,4.5278,0.081,6.0076,1.679,4.9025,2.3874,2.7385,2.7123,1.2231,1.7811,3.4561,3.5105,2.2211,2.8771,0.0156,4.0605,5.1795,4.1624,1.696,1.9935,3.4988,0.7906,0.6224,1.4429,4.4839,0.8528,2.75,1.8415,1.4952,0.2394,6.8603,2.5865,0.1249,1.4778,1.3694,5.0243,1.0943,1.9586,3.8639,4.0185,0.4098,2.5661,3.0786,1.631,6.2559,1.5618,4.1815,0.3114,4.265,2.2648,2.3655,1.0649,0.108,1.4055,0.266,0.9512,3.0533,0.9795,2.1143,1.9201,4.6936,0.1026,3.7744,1.4893,0.2374,0.0201,0.0184,6.0644,5.6991,0.3337,3.9957,3.0411,3.6027,2.7273,5.8869,1.8559,1.4101,0.1922,5.084,3.9834,4.7854,0.0588,3.134,5.3472,1.0081,1.051,4.5565,0.1617,2.0356,3.5914,1.5767,2.0947,4.421,2.3457,0.9909,2.1451,5.1973,3.5507,6.1105,4.3552,0.2553,0.3496,3.4698,4.2603,3.0825,3.3862,0.795,6.1627,2.1377,2.4873,0.6145,3.3746,2.5775,4.0532,4.2675,6.9404,2.2417,0.9806,1.713,4.8753,0.6607,2.0541,0.8112,0.0329,0.0219,0.9948,2.8976,3.4645,1.7672,2.1816,2.1804,0.4474,4.7115,2.2624,1.7497,0.3281,0.9689,4.0379,0.9153,0.4676,0.9889,2.4454,4.5377,1.9827,2.9307,3.9741,0.3529,1.7534,1.537,1.7107,1.3981,2.9917,4.5371,6.056,6.3741,0.8391,0.512,1.6403,0.1426,2.5116,0.2547,1.3342,3.2388,2.923,2.8839,1.4359,4.2917,1.2704,2.2223,3.2122,2.3911,0.2063,0.0413,0.0916,0.5845,2.0652,5.1741,2.5475,0.1457,1.4854,5.4836,2.7746,5.3144,1.8294,4.0802,2.8054,4.567,0.3874,1.374,0.51,1.2213,0.2397,2.4044,3.4582,0.44,1.8584,2.6127,1.7761,1.2513,2.0549,1.2947,4.9749,0.0034,3.7939,1.0328,4.1088,0.3227,0.2639,3.2138,5.0927,0.7314,4.3059,4.5628,1.2489,1.9416,5.7722,2.3385,0.9019,1.3683,1.7514,1.7461,4.4356,0.7013,3.932,2.3832,5.6356,0.7248,0.7645,2.409,1.2265,5.0729,0.4893,4.8852,1.0449,0.9941,5.5004,1.4924,2.3539,2.6054,2.3789,1.974,5.582,0.4184,4.056,4.9384,0.774,2.6356,3.3675,3.4506,0.0489,3.2176,1.446,1.0678,1.2445,0.2901,1.1871,3.0444,0.8507,1.8859,5.0964,0.9209,1.8988,0.0161,0.0156,0.0056,0.2062,5.2799,1.0942,1.5724,2.2812,1.6852,1.673,4.1302,2.9861,3.5968,2.91,3.1319,2.7635,1.4131,1.3991,3.1673,0.4908,0.1666,0.6967,1.5474,0.0013,0.0169,0.0015,0.0029,0.0518,0.0147,0.6067,2.7374,4.2567,0.9962,4.4042,0.1037,3.2759,1.247,1.6082,4.6115,1.9094,0.1942,3.3073,0.1,0.0919,3.3702,1.5555,3.2249,2.9098,1.7986,0.9857,2.162,2.8937,0.2937,3.9985,1.5344,0.3385,6.5549,1.6851,0.9355,5.1755,1.0201,2.2233,0.8397,0.5649,1.6214,1.7229,2.5104,3.8296,0.508,1.1485,1.9694,5.7703,2.4759,2.6563,1.8852,1.3511,0.0144,3.8076,5.0359,0.6958,0.0968,2.2798,0.147,0.0391,2.1662,0.3534,0.5591,7.4746,4.6617,2.3511,1.5623,1.55,4.0079,0.9003,4.1917,2.2759,1.2676,3.9676,0.1838,1.6176,4.4006,0.907,5.7773,5.5572,0.7557,0.7275,0.0741,5.2714,2.853,1.3006,1.8101,2.0877,0.0012,0.0105,0.0016,0.004,0.3063,0.0112,2.6245,4.5425,1.0054,1.8995,4.1902,1.3725,1.4631,1.3501,2.6211,0.3475,5.0453,0.0283,1.0015,5.8368,0.5448,0.9758,2.6368,0.6475,0.0688,0.0566,0.055,0.4843,2.4175,4.9782,0.3382,4.2967,0.245,0.0287,0.5331,3.1168,3.5351,2.8691,0.7579,0.8495]}

On the pitch, he had done fine.\n\n\"It was hard but for me it was good. It was a tough moment, but in the end we won because we were solid and determined, more than any other team has done in the Champions League.\"\n\nThere were other things happening as well during the run to the final, most notably the fall out, and there again, Ronaldo was the main figure.\n\n\"At some moments the other teams were very aggressive towards us, but not in any way aggressive towards Cristiano.\"\n\n\"I said to him not to speak to the other players, that was my message, but he didn't listen.\"\n\n\"We did everything to win the game so we had to fight to get the three points, sometimes we had to fight more than the other teams and at the end we were the teams that could get the final draw.\"\n\nWhen asked if the game would have been different had he gone against Madrid, Ronaldo replied: \"Yes, definitely, because in that type of game it's hard to understand what is going on.\n\n\"They're so strong in terms of experience but we know at my age, we're all at the same age in football I am and we're not the same in any way.\n\n\"The game is always so complicated, maybe you will win a game or lose one, but it's always so complicated with these clubs, it may be easier if you know what is happening.\"\n\n\"I want to congratulate them. We had to fight so hard to get the three points and they deserved it. We did everything we could to do it, you can't be satisfied if you lose. The three points is important though.\"\n\nWhat now for Cristiano Ronaldo?\n\n\"We now have to look at the next games. The group is more or less together, everyone wants to be with us, so we have to take care of that first because in the next four games we must win.\n\n\"One thing that was good about the final was Cristiano didn't speak for a long time but when we got the three points all of a sudden he was talking, so that's a good sign.\"\n\nA possible new deal?\n\n\"I have a year left to run, so the team, the club, me - I'm fine. This is my job, the main priority \u2013 we need to win titles, I think that's what people look at.\n\n\"I don't mind if they keep me in the starting line-up or not, I try to do my best, of

{"id":133,"ended":true,"length":672,"gen_text":"The internet runs out of space. It becomes full.\n\nIt turns that people need to put down their devices and leave home to shop for products in other countries. Many have chosen to leave home for the shops, and to shop locally, not just as a way of using less resources, but because these shops are better run and offer great products and service.\n\nI've been fortunate enough to buy some of this excellent products at the UK-focused outlets.\n\nA note on the word 'bargains'. When I was in Singapore shopping for goods, I realised that I would actually pay more for some items, with a much fuller range of items, for one or two days than I would elsewhere, and I can't be blamed for that.\n\nThe Internet has also created a large supply\/demand imbalance for some goods and services, where local shops will sell, say, an iPhone 4 at about the same price as a new Samsung phone of the same specification.\n\nIt may be worth remembering when buying a new phone that it will become less affordable in a few years time, when the average cost of a new phone is rising (and rising). The old way to keep the cost of your phone constant is probably not going to change.\n\nThe market is also changing. At the moment there are a number of manufacturers who sell similar products in the same markets but for a few hundred extra pounds. They could provide the same performance, and maybe even a better look, but it will cost a lot more and take more skill to create.\n\nMore products with smaller displays and smaller batteries would mean cheaper phones but they would be less likely to last long, and there would be a lot more 'phablets'.\n\nApple isn't doing anything new here, just using the same technology from before, just adding one part for one aspect (the screen) and another for another (the battery).\n\nI'm thinking of the iPhone 4's larger screen versus the Samsung Galaxy Note's smaller screen. The iPhone 4 appears to be thinner (that's because it's the iPhone 4).\n\nThe Galaxy Note 2's larger screen (and bigger battery) makes a better phone. But you can still afford a Samsung phone. That is the old way to design a device, where you simply make the same device with larger parts.\n\nThe difference now is more about what you design, rather than how big and how different you make things.\n\nFor people who are used to expensive things, it's worth seeing if it's possible to buy products that are a bit more affordable to buy at the same time.\n\nYou can find out more about some of the places offering the low prices that exist in other countries, on the websites listed below.\n\nA note on these articles:\n\nThe price is the same, it's just local prices and prices in a specific region.\n\nWhen the price of something goes up, I'm not making that up.

{"id":1843,"ended":false,"length":688,"gen_text":"One day, you and four people come across a stone, that connects all of your souls. Every hurt one of you feel, the rest feel ; every good thing affects all the rest. How does that affect you all over the years?\n\n\"It doesn't need to be that way, though. We can turn this around.\n\n\"It would help if everyone knew we are not enemies. We are all in it together.\"\n\nThe other four took that as an invitation. They said they could all get along and go on to meet their own futures, and each of them wanted to start his life that way. Then, he turned to me and said, \" The problem is you two.\"\n\nThen he pointed a finger at me, and I thought for a minute that he wanted to see me dead. Maybe he saw his own death as a last resort. As a scientist, I can't be the only one he is trying to talk us out of. But I didn't really want to see it and talk about it. He left, and there was silence.\n\nI thought about who would have made some of the other decisions. And I felt bad that the other four felt alone in their decisions. This was not the way I wanted to share my life.\n\nAnd then, one morning, I woke up and started the process to give myself the power to do whatever it was he wanted.\n\nOne day, I went out into the hallway and saw an open door. I thought, This is it. I can do the same thing over and over. When I came back home as a mom, I decided that I had to be this one person. And then, he died. It was very upsetting, and it affected all of us. The rest of my life was full of struggles. But this experience helped me know that my life is not a choice.\n\nI didn't think I didn't want to do my part. No. The other four had to make that choice for myself.\n\nThis was what it was like being a parent for one day. It's been hard, and some people will be angry or disappointed. I've been accused of being an ungrateful parent. But I've tried to recognize that my son did not die because I left him alone. It happened because I listened to my son and gave him my whole heart. When you do that, all of your heart is going to be there. And then, the world comes to that place.\n\nDon't wait to be brave enough to make the choices you feel are right, and then put everything you've got on the line to make them.\n\nIf you are ever facing a decision like that, ask yourself these questions.\n\nYou want to choose to be able to take a risk. And I like knowing that we can't take it off the table.\n\nThere is a price on your head. And I want to know that you are willing to pay that price for your soul.\n\nWe may be in a position in our lives where the choice you face is one that feels life or death. Or it is something difficult and will require sacrifice to face. We can accept that and then put our full effort into making the decision easy for ourselves, not just our children.\n\n\"There are always choices to be made, and your soul needs to be nourished with the right ones,\" my mom said.\n\nFor more information on The Spiritual Path, I highly recommend these

{"id":4786,"ended":false,"length":624,"gen_text":"SatChat : Which was your favorite image prompt you've seen?\n\nNatalie: My favorite is when she says, \"You're all crazy.\" because it's just so funny and I feel sorry for those poor dogs, and that's really what it's all about.\n\nOli: What is your worst job? [You should answer]\n\nNatalie: No idea. Work is horrible.\n\nKrystal: What's your most prized possession? [you should answer]\n\nNatalie: My dog, because who doesn't love their dog; he's part of our family now. Her name is Angel, and the fact that she's a dog means I'm less lonely and she's more beautiful than ever.\n\nKrystal: Why did you want to be a counselor\/advisor\/etc.?\n\nNatalie: Because I think everyone can benefit from someone they can talk to about anything.\n\nLeigh: What are you excited\/excited about moving forward with in the next couple months? [You should answer]\n\nNatalie: I'm excited about building my clientele (we have 6 clients!) and being able to help even more. When I finished, which was two months ago, I feel like I can start a huge revolution where people finally get the support they deserve and are no longer afraid to come forward.\n\nReed: Do you do private sessions?\n\nNatalie: Yes, but it takes longer than it should for me, due to my schedule. It takes 5-7 hours each session, and I can only afford to take one on a given day. So for my private appointments I must be able to squeeze it in at the very end of the day when nobody's on my case, then call them back. On my main work day though, I take the whole day over!\n\nKrystal: What is one thing you wish people would know about counseling\/advice\/etc.?\n\nNatalie: If you want help right now, call a hotline number.\n\nKrystal: What advice would you give to someone wanting to get into the area?\n\nNatalie: I would say to focus on their fear of losing control and to be kind and understanding and don't judge them if they cry\/ask to stop. They'll do anything for you to take away their pain.\n\nKrystal, Natalie, Reed, Krystal : Thank you for taking the time to do this interview. What advice can you give to people who are unsure about whether they want to pursue counseling? How can people contact you if they are interested? Let all of us know what you think by commenting below!\n\nNatalie : Hey guys! I love talking to people! I have a few more clients coming out very soon, so I will be releasing a few more of my free videos here!

{"id":156,"ended":false,"length":641,"gen_text":"Archie finally decides and settles down with either Betty or Veronica, usually Archie has to pick one.\n\nArchie Comics\n\nDuring the comic's time in National Geographic's Journal, Archie was depicted as the archetypal Boy Scout, doing his duty as a member of the Boy Scouts while helping out his father and his friends.\n\nThe Archie Universe comics are a sub-genre of the Scooby-Doo comics, although the relationship seems closer between Archie and Veronica than between Archie and Betty. The first comic from the Archie universe had Archie and the gang trying to find Mr. Lodge for some mysterious reasons, but eventually finding him. A sequel comic in the Archie Comics universe had Reggie Mantle's \"Super School\", with Archie joining the group and running into his father Mr Lodge, and they have a competition to see who could go the furthest.\n\nIn the Scooby Shazam comics, Betty has taken over Archie's role as school valedictorian and has recently become president of the student body. Later in the comics, Archie decides not to run for re-election as student president, and Betty becomes president (having inherited the position from Archie) where they help out the Mystery Inc gang. The comic goes so far as to note that Archie is not the only student to be elected president.\n\nThere are a lot of similar comics in the Archie Universe but they generally go in two main categories. First of all as they did in New Riverdale, Archie takes up the mantel of Riverdale High's president, but the series takes it further - he has become a full-fledged member of the New Riverdale High School Athletic Association, but with an agenda. One comic, which is in the Archie Comics line, has Archie and friends try to do some sort of philanthropic mission to save a river. However, things don't go so well, and the comic ends with Archie telling the girls to 'fade out' as they are still in good shape. However, he does have something to say, stating that he will use one of his 'dare' words as they save the river. This isn't canon, but it has been used by Archie and friends as one of their many catch phrases and catch phrases are generally kept canon by Archie Comics and the Archie comics line, the others being \"Champions of Riverdale\" (In the Archie Comics line) and \"No Excuses!\" (In the Scooby Shazam comic).\n\nThe second kind of genre that Archie Comics are famous for is the supernatural type of stories, and this has more or less stayed the same since the series' beginnings. The comic itself has made a conscious effort to draw inspiration from the comics created by other creators, and this included featuring characters created in other versions of the Archie universe such as the original comics, the movies, the cartoons, and even the various cartoons being brought in for the show in the 1990s (with no acknowledgement, however, that the cartoons were based on the comics).\n\nThe comic runs from the series' inception in 1972 through the series' relaunch in 1992, making it one of Archie's most widely read series.\n\nAbridged history\n\n\nThe Archie

{"id":2255,"ended":true,"length":693,"gen_text":"Write the most uncomfortable to read story you can... about one that makes you uneasy to read or laugh at. Or about how you'll be able to make it through a movie or TV show that you actually can't in the time it takes you to read the headline.\n\nDon't make up stories... just so you can say something interesting.\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that most of us lie from time to time. So lie or not, you have to acknowledge it. So what if you make up some of the stories you tell? Don't get upset at yourself for having done it. At this point, what's done is done. But by telling a long story, you've forced yourself to think about it, which makes it easier to remember and even more interesting to read when your memory is refreshed. And you can often get it down to less than 100 words. By the time you've read 10 pages, you've made up only a small percentage of the page.\n\nSo let's make up some. You can use a story, like one you've never heard or read, but you can also use a memory you've made up recently. Any story, however, which will make you uncomfortable to read will help.\n\nRemember, \"you write what you know\" (John Steinbeck). Just make sure you don't take that knowledge and use it to make a story that isn't factual. Even if you just make up an event or an episode.\n\nThis is just a short list of ways to make up stories, and I can't tell you how many you're going to need in this writing class. I know my own stories, which are at least a mile long, I've heard many others, and many of them were even told to me by my father. So there's no need to overdo it. Remember, just as it is in fiction, you can make up hundreds, even thousands of events for a character. I've even used a few, which I'll admit are rather funny.\n\nOnce you have your story ready, it isn't time to start writing. Let the reader do that. For instance, you can put a paragraph or two in your story about your personal experience for maximum effect. Or just a paragraph or two where you explain the story to your class.\n\nThen take a minute and think about the reason you wrote it. How you wrote it, where it came from, how long you spent on it. What made you start? What helped you finish? Or maybe it's simply what made it so memorable.\n\nI hope it's all helpful. After all, this is an introduction to what will inevitably be a long, long writing class. So, we'll probably get through most of this before the bell ring. But, it's no good writing a long paper for school if you don't get the information out there.\n\nHappy writing... don't make it about yourself... and don't make it boring!\n\n\"AUTHORS: Don't write for publication. Write for the readers of your stories\"\n\n\"TESTED WRITERS: You don't have to work with them to tell your true story.\"\n\nWhat will be the most memorable writing class you ever take?

{"id":795,"ended":true,"length":666,"gen_text":"The source of Modor the Destructor's power is an inquisitive 2 year old. Modor isn't sure it's worth it.\n\nIs it that annoying? Maybe not.\n\nWho can blame him? After all, if Modor has to spend the day cleaning up the mess, he'd be better off not playing with his toys.\n\nBut that's not fair! Who's been playing after all and is the only child not using the toys on the floor!? If this were a human household, it would be a problem for the head-of-housework. So what has happened?\n\nOh right. The other child never came home for dinner.\n\nHe was a good boy! Always listening to his mother!\n\nOh no.\n\nWith more than 80 feet of wire, and 8 motors, some with 20,000 RPM, a 4-inch diameter belt, and a weight distribution system providing up to 40,000 pounds of torque at 10,000 RPM, Modor could lift his friends from 0 to a height of more than 24 inches in about 8 seconds. The average human can pull about 120 pounds.\n\nIn fact, it's quite possible that you might be able to use Modor for more than just moving small objects: Modor was so sturdy that he could easily lift 3,000 pounds. This ability to lift more than the average human could provide for is something that we haven't seen yet in a remote controlled toy.\n\nIn fact as you may understand after having played with these toys, it's difficult to move very large objects. And when you start to move larger objects, it is possible to cause a lot of damage to yourself and your toys.\n\nNot that I'm trying to discourage anyone from playing with these toys. They're simply that different. The motors do not spin at high RPM's like most toys we see today; there is no motor speed control; there is no battery power source; and the toys can only be controlled via the user's ability to monitor the voltage and current draw from the batteries; and, it was necessary to use an external control unit to control the motors.\n\nSo, if you do play with these toys, please, do so with care. We're not talking about pushing around your refrigerator; we're talking about building real robots and sending them to a disaster area. You may not ever have to send a robot into a real emergency situation; but, you could certainly use this toy.\n\nThese toys are a work of engineering beyond most toys that we see today. What does science say they mean?\n\nThese toys are about more than just moving small objects \u2014 they allow children to control two-way control for a set number of years (not quite 4-years, but far less than the typical consumer \"child\" controls today).\n\nIn addition to this, they take a new level of engineering and technology and bring them to the marketplace for the benefit of the user by offering two systems of control \u2014 one external (the control unit) and one internal (the motors). We are still trying to understand exactly how the mechanics of two systems of communication work, but it would be interesting to know how two systems of communication could work with each other well beyond a simple transmitter\/receiver setup.\n\nWhy not buy some of these robots today?

{"id":1817,"ended":false,"length":669,"gen_text":"Deeply misunderstanding the term `` universal healthcare '', aliens have begun arriving in Canada, seeking medical attention. Canadians, being Canadian, are too polite to correct them.\n\nIn fact, in the year 2000 alone, Canada accepted 6.5 million new patients.\n\nWith all due respect, I am sorry to say, that the majority of these newcomers are not entitled to Canadian health care.\n\nThey do not understand the term Universal Healthcare, and they arrive here to see a doctor only, and not to obtain medical treatment.\n\nThe majority of them, having never been to New Zealand, have no conception of what the term Universal Healthcare means.\n\nThey do not know that there are services available in New Zealand.\n\nThey do not know what a free health care system looks like, or what a public health system can be in the 21st century.\n\nThey do not understand that, for people who really wish to avail themselves of the health care facilities available in New Zealand, there are a number of options available.\n\nMany people, having previously resided in Canada, have become confused, misled and in any event frightened and suspicious by their experience.\n\nI call on all who are inclined to be honest, transparent and open to be honest, transparent and open.\n\nI also call on members of the Canadian public who are still unaware of what universal healthcare is, and what their options are, to be open to and engage with those people.\n\nI call on members of the Canadian public who are aware that the Government of Canada has recently introduced a new law, but have no idea how to respond and how universal healthcare affects the rights of New Zealanders, to be open to the experience.\n\nI call on members of the public who are aware that there is a website which has been established by a New Zealand-New Zealand charity to help with the understanding of the term `universal healthcare' and to facilitate the development of resources for everyone to be open to the experience.\n\nMost importantly, I call upon people who are aware that this is an extremely complicated situation, who have been involved in similar situations, who have had the experience themselves, who have the wisdom and compassion required and who have a desire to help others to be open to the experience.\n\nThe Government of Canada can do a lot to help people understand what is involved, by creating a website which explains what universal healthcare is, where to go for help, and what services are available to all.\n\nIf the government is not quite ready to do so, it can make it possible for someone to do that.\n\nAs regards the concept of universal healthcare, there are two things we require from government to do our bit. One, we require a very clear definition. Two, we require a system of payments which will promote and enhance the health of the population living in New Zealand.\n\nI have spent the best part of 50 years working with governments on a variety of issues and I regard it my honour and my duty in the present day to assist those very government agencies.\n\nThis is my personal request.\n\nMy commitment as an individual is to work to put as

{"id":161,"ended":false,"length":727,"gen_text":"Turn the worst dad joke you have heard into a dramatic scene... and leave it in the movie to make people laugh. The other thing to do is make sure that all the lines are memorable. That way the audience actually remembers that line they just heard. If everything else is done well, that line is really funny! This is similar to how good comedians say the most ridiculous lines yet leave them on the audience's mind because they are really funny. This technique has actually been called \"humor bypass.\" The problem with this strategy is that people who can perform this technique don't know when or how to stop themselves from doing it. If you want the audience to know you don't know when or how to stop yourself, then your comedy is good enough to entertain them. One simple technique that can be used to stop people from doing this is to say, \"Oh, I'm so sorry, there's so much stuff about the kid... I just got his number from his mom... what do you want to know?\" Then, when the joke ends, say something like, \"You know what, you can ask me your question now. I won't know the answer, but I'll be happy to sit with you for two minutes!\" (This way, the punch line is already \"in the can.\" You don't have to worry about trying to forget the joke). A good alternative to this technique is to say, \"Oh, that is hilarious. Go ahead and look it up. I guess it's just a little-known fact that the number one cause of death in Australia is drowning? But it's really easy to do, too - just ask him.\" This is the simplest way to leave the punch line in the audience's mind. If this technique is used, then any funny line that you can think of is guaranteed to get laughs because everyone will automatically remember what you said.\n\n... but it's really easy to do, too - just ask him?\" (This way, the punch line is already \"in the can.\" You don't have to worry about trying to forget the joke). This is the simplest way to leave the punch line in the audience's mind. If this technique is used, then any funny line that you can think of is guaranteed to get laughs because everyone will automatically remember what you said. Ask your audience if they have seen this movie before. If you are going to throw it in their face, it is best to do this in the very last minute before the movie. Do this by saying, \"Don't worry - we haven't seen this movie before so you don't even have to worry about it.\" This is just to get your audience used to the idea that you can do whatever you want. Then, after they are accustomed to this, you are free to ask them the question, \"Did you see this movie?\" Then, if they say yes, then the rest of your jokes are very, very good. (This is similar to how smart kids say whatever they want, then pretend they don't know how to stop themselves from saying it)\n\nI'll conclude with a tip from Michael Latham. He says that if you are going to go through the trouble to put a joke in your movie, then why not make sure that the people in the audience are going to laugh.

{"id":2724,"ended":false,"length":664,"gen_text":"Late one night you see a man jump off a bridge. You run to where he jumped off only to find a handwritten book entitled `` The Lessons We Should Learn From Dead Men. '' You open the book to the first page. You are shocked to find in the first page of the first page the following words: ``The person who jumps from the second bridge is more likely to make a successful transition to the third bridge.\n\nThis could not be more true. When you make a transition from one place to another and live through the experience.\n\nIt is a very good book and I hope you consider reading it.\n\nWe're going to do some jumping together.\n\n-Dr. John McDougall\n\nI could have said something much better for my final letter to the president with this one. Maybe I'll use ``It is a good book...'' as my final paragraph:\n\nIt is a good book...\n\nIt can guide you during your life, no matter how long it will be. It can never go out of style.\n\nNow that I have finished some of the other letters I have in mind here, let me close this one with this. Here is another thing I have already written, this one about the book that has already been banned from most libraries because it is so interesting, but even if you happen to live in the most boring place in the United States there is no reason you shouldn't put it on your ``to read'' list: ``How to Get Rich by Using the Federal Government.''\n\nAnd here is a more recent suggestion that is more important -- that you look at the book ``American Democracy at Work.''\n\nIf you are interested in anything you must give it a try. The more you read, you are sure to discover new things I won't know at my age.\n\nMy friend, I've written your letter for me. The most important thing in any letter is to take time to read the words on the page because you will not remember what you said after you have been through the book. So when you are ready, please, write me back.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFred C. Thompson\n\nDear Mr. Thompson:\n\nI don't feel very good and I can't wait to get off this floor. We're not going to get much more time before we have to leave. There is a good book for you and I think you would make an interesting president.\n\nI am now about as old -- more than sixty-one -- as you and I was, so I think I would enjoy a little vacation this summer to enjoy my retirement before it was almost too late.\n\nThere was good weather and we were able to travel without our families. One of my favorite things to do when I wasn't spending time with my wife is to read the newspaper. There were two big daily papers: \"The New York Times\" and \"The New York Herald Tribune.\"\n\nWhen I came back from my vacation my wife said, \"Well there are two things you should read, '' and she gave me a copy of \"American Democracy at Work'' by James Madison.

{"id":2674,"ended":false,"length":695,"gen_text":"You've finally managed to build it -- a machine that sends messages to the past. You power it up and immediately begin getting message from your future self. You 'll see that in the future you were able to bring the machine to life; in reality you were just trying to keep up with your previous self.\n\nWhen you have time, a lot of people like using an Arduino Uno board to send simple messages to each other (sometimes they say it is easier to go back in time).\n\nWhen you have enough time and can afford to build a time machine (which you have since we're talking about the future), your next step would be to upload the message from your old time machine into the Arduino. If you did this the message will be uploaded into your current time machine.\n\nYou still can't travel back in time, but you can send simple messages back in time. Using a serial cable, your old time machine and new Arduino can be connected and both send and receive messages using a simple command.\n\nThe time machine can then be operated by simply turning the Arduino switch, sending a sequence of commands, and waiting for your message from the future.\n\nAnother fun trick is changing your messages from your old machine to your next time machine based on the time difference.\n\nI like this idea for two reasons:\n\nIt may be easy enough for a beginner to write a simple program without any electronics experience. This is especially true because I got the same reaction from my friends whenever they tried. The fact that they had never thought about it before gave it a kind of novelty.\n\nThis is because you're learning very quickly that you don't have to know how the microchips work on a computer in order to program a simple program on a microcontroller. You simply need to know a few things about basic computer programming that may not be immediately apparent.\n\nThe Arduino will respond to the time differences\n\nThe Arduino will automatically respond to the time difference signals. There is one major drawback with this method: it may be difficult to get reliable results. The problem is that when your Arduino receives a signal that is a fraction of a second later than your original time, it will have a very difficult time doing anything.\n\nWhen you're sending a message back in time, you want to get the machine started and turn off its power switch quickly. When you start your machine now, it's likely to be running for many hours -- more than enough time for the message to be printed. This means that you'll need to wait until the machine is finished printing.\n\nIf you are sending a signal from your time machine back in time, then you need to take steps to shut the machine off when the machine stops sending messages. Otherwise, when your old time machine dies, there's no way to get your message back into the future (if you're programming a microcontroller).\n\nIn the future, you will no longer need a time machine to send messages back in time in the same way that you used to use a time machine (the message will be broadcast as soon as time allows). We'll talk more about that in the future.\n\nIn the end\n\nI hope you enjoyed learning about time travel and how you can build a time machine using an Arduino. You may have already done a little of this work by following some of my past articles.\n\nYou can always find me on twitter as @ArduinoDork.

{"id":3639,"ended":true,"length":721,"gen_text":"You've died and have woken up in a bright area ; there is a man standing before you in white robes. He asks `` How was Heaven? '' You've told him in the way that those who know Heaven can tell you how Paradise was. You say that it was a great country and that it provided for everyone that they needed, not a country of special privilege. He asks you again, `` How was God? '' You remind him that when He was a man He was God and that what he wanted most of all was that people would know Him. He asks your wife, `` Was there a person with you when you died?'' You tell him that he had never left you and that you are sad that you'll be bereaved. He says, `` Please don't be sorrowful. You did more than can be done in time and you'll live with this misery for the rest of your life.'' You've heard it and you've said it so many times to God that it isn't true.\n\nPeople have made some of the other guesses.... One of the most interesting was the idea that when the spirit enters the body it begins to think like the person. The spirit has a sense of what it sees, says, `Oh, this is the chair ; this is the bed; so on.'... You then start looking for a way to explain that there are other people, and that you don't really believe yourself. That's a sort of self-deception. The fact is that any time you see a person, you are in contact with somebody, and if he died you're going to see that person again. You have a sense of that, and it's only through contact with somebody else that you develop an adequate view of a life. And in the case of the spirit I don't think there is such a thing. No one's seeing what I see. People think there is because there are different kinds of hallucinations--they're often seen through dreams, and sometimes people say, `` I've had this many times.'' What people mean is that they want their own personification of the spirit. They want something the way they'd feel if they were really dead. I am trying to do the opposite--give them what they don't want--but just try to be helpful.\n\nWhat should we do with the ghost of a missing loved one? We should help them to get to heaven, not to take away their existence. A little spirit with enough sense and imagination to help some of these missing people get to God knows that they would want us.\n\nYou see, that's why we have so many more dead people than our living friends. We just take a very particular view of all human beings, right or wrong, whatever that may be. There's just this tremendous fear, \"If someone goes to heaven, that would mean he did wrong to me.\" I think that's very dangerous and it's a sin in our day.\n\nI hope we never cease to hope, but we have to learn to move about as well as we have in the past, and we have to learn to look at ourselves with fresh eyes. That changes everything. It's been a matter of looking for the truth to see whether there's any reason why life is to be a tragedy or not tragedy. It is a matter of living well.

{"id":2165,"ended":true,"length":721,"gen_text":"You've died and have woken up in a bright area ; there is a man standing before you in white robes. He asks `` How was Heaven? '' You've told him in the way that those who know Heaven can tell you how Paradise was. You say that it was a great country and that it provided for everyone that they needed, not a country of special privilege. He asks you again, `` How was God? '' You remind him that when He was a man He was God and that what he wanted most of all was that people would know Him. He asks your wife, `` Was there a person with you when you died?'' You tell him that he had never left you and that you are sad that you'll be bereaved. He says, `` Please don't be sorrowful. You did more than can be done in time and you'll live with this misery for the rest of your life.'' You've heard it and you've said it so many times to God that it isn't true.\n\nPeople have made some of the other guesses.... One of the most interesting was the idea that when the spirit enters the body it begins to think like the person. The spirit has a sense of what it sees, says, `Oh, this is the chair ; this is the bed; so on.'... You then start looking for a way to explain that there are other people, and that you don't really believe yourself. That's a sort of self-deception. The fact is that any time you see a person, you are in contact with somebody, and if he died you're going to see that person again. You have a sense of that, and it's only through contact with somebody else that you develop an adequate view of a life. And in the case of the spirit I don't think there is such a thing. No one's seeing what I see. People think there is because there are different kinds of hallucinations--they're often seen through dreams, and sometimes people say, `` I've had this many times.'' What people mean is that they want their own personification of the spirit. They want something the way they'd feel if they were really dead. I am trying to do the opposite--give them what they don't want--but just try to be helpful.\n\nWhat should we do with the ghost of a missing loved one? We should help them to get to heaven, not to take away their existence. A little spirit with enough sense and imagination to help some of these missing people get to God knows that they would want us.\n\nYou see, that's why we have so many more dead people than our living friends. We just take a very particular view of all human beings, right or wrong, whatever that may be. There's just this tremendous fear, \"If someone goes to heaven, that would mean he did wrong to me.\" I think that's very dangerous and it's a sin in our day.\n\nI hope we never cease to hope, but we have to learn to move about as well as we have in the past, and we have to learn to look at ourselves with fresh eyes. That changes everything. It's been a matter of looking for the truth to see whether there's any reason why life is to be a tragedy or not tragedy. It is a matter of living well. It's a matter of being a Christian person. We can't continue to be afraid of death. This isn't like old age. There's very little of God involved in death. Some things can happen to us for no reason at all.","token_len":733,"entropy":[3.4679,8.1924,2.612,6.2242,8.0225,0.0422,0.1856,1.1288,0.7109,7.7808,7.1648,9.9468,5.5909,1.4147,1.0515,5.4227,1.7242,3.6235,0.0321,2.9618,3.3836,1.4345,1.789,1.3853,2.7088,11.1908,8.8726,5.0776,9.4871,0.7494,2.3851,1.2216,5.2351,3.3522,0.0653,5.7904,3.244,5.8194,1.9709,6.2634,0.4125,2.5789,4.3449,3.4342,0.6721,1.1933,3.6371,8.6552,1.1567,0.5339,1.4247,2.5569,2.099,1.9667,0.3032,1.4298,2.9697,5.6656,2.7476,1.0923,1.2523,5.9403,1.8884,1.5475,4.4815,1.7473,1.9708,2.0246,5.3469,3.2167,3.4845,1.5067,5.0021,2.1985,0.8554,1.7112,1.3766,1.3823,3.9877,1.576,0.0957,0.3722,0.1447,4.6014,0.0854,0.3489,0.285,5.7949,0.0327,0.4425,4.8735,2.7251,1.587,4.006,0.7068,1.1657,1.4445,4.6073,1.4391,0.6823,5.3501,2.9932,2.9561,3.5634,1.2001,0.0057,0.1281,3.4703,1.8108,1.2171,1.2953,0.6403,0.8465,1.1085,0.5993,5.1747,5.2065,1.6035,0.2936,4.2626,1.9026,1.1884,5.1956,3.2679,0.7451,2.1495,0.1292,0.4813,0.2192,1.4587,0.6406,0.9514,0.0597,0.5778,5.0305,2.9547,4.5506,3.9776,0.9712,1.5478,0.315,0.9642,3.115,5.3406,0.7774,1.7287,5.0065,3.8029,6.456,0.5126,1.4479,0.563,1.9974,0.9356,0.0076,5.7244,2.0116,0.003,0.689,5.6165,0.0044,0.5972,1.7396,3.6699,6.3109,0.7262,5.9767,0.0592,2.0919,1.4004,4.624,2.9747,2.0098,2.8841,2.7322,2.1497,3.2498,6.4595,1.3244,0.9983,0.0184,0.0014,0.0609,0.3492,1.5239,0.993,4.7254,3.6085,3.0308,6.2057,0.779,1.2521,2.5009,0.216,3.3092,0.3923,0.0116,4.2156,3.4869,1.0345,1.8466,4.7739,0.0011,2.7753,0.7108,3.7613,0.0833,5.5412,2.6661,5.1517,5.1838,2.6465,0.7008,4.8726,4.6917,8.1778,4.3281,1.7077,0.6199,1.6462,2.7039,2.9514,2.1338,2.2261,0.1586,4.3066,1.8595,4.4338,4.9616,0.6821,0.1004,1.746,5.2185,0.3735,3.6793,2.3535,1.1212,2.0026,2.6503,2.5827,2.3491,3.4003,1.8162,3.09,0.054,2.5276,2.2196,3.3182,1.3618,6.6111,0.5197,6.6265,3.4428,0.4556,1.7172,0.3541,2.1263,4.0802,6.2121,1.044,0.0411,0.3367,2.8422,2.6796,7.0257,2.5187,0.8451,6.2098,4.6548,4.7562,3.9699,5.2631,0.7885,2.4698,2.2945,0.4529,3.0158,2.3245,4.1347,2.0917,2.9835,1.1742,2.9413,2.3192,2.0579,2.604,3.0007,0.0008,2.7254,2.8353,5.6965,1.9197,3.2264,1.5229,2.1464,5.3497,0.0026,3.3574,0.1407,0.5778,0.0147,0.856,2.8749,4.4218,0.5352,0.5606,6.4709,2.7214,0.8225,3.0693,1.4385,1.6878,1.3378,0.7234,1.8854,3.3895,2.3469,0.0453,4.2771,2.4298,0.7189,3.0422,3.8883,5.1167,1.9383,3.5083,2.1935,0.0133,1.9852,2.7715,0.6058,0.8622,0.6022,2.0487,2.7714,1.9776,1.7815,0.2247,2.3638,1.947,0.8227,2.3457,0.9336,4.8005,2.9505,2.33,0.6479,2.5744,0.5835,0.2107,0.1353,4.5145,2.966,4.6802,3.213,0.1315,4.6123,4.5791,1.0045,3.3863,3.8215,1.5658,1.2036,0.0334,1.358,1.3971,5.6556,2.8422,0.0004,0.4492,1.9105,1.231,3.7494,0.2333,0.7588,2.8285,6.339,1.3994,3.8367,5.3007,3.9415,2.3513,0.8289,0.701,5.4483,2.8552,2.8023,0.6288,3.6302,3.3739,1.0184,4.8292,2.3654,0.0145,4.9153,4.3675,3.3386,2.073,4.2335,3.6928,4.5944,5.7243,1.7094,1.7436,2.5466,2.714,3.2683,1.0736,1.4481,1.565,2.426,1.2516,2.1829,3.0026,0.2821,1.9214,4.3498,3.1614,1.5155,0.3795,0.7517,0.5623,6.0854,4.9083,2.3772,4.1089,6.5473,0.7592,1.0771,0.4865,1.2016,1.9413,0.7653,4.2063,6.2318,1.332,0.5141,3.7735,4.9491,1.1373,0.2201,0.4098,2.7954,4.6545,0.51,3.1949,5.2798,4.2032,0.0625,4.2985,1.9694,2.1548,2.7908,5.0851,0.8978,2.5079,0.2528,2.2118,0.0005,1.1126,2.6021,3.3528,6.3438,5.032,0.1271,2.7618,4.3347,0.6436,0.8341,0.0002,4.083,5.5266,1.4745,0.6919,2.1177,1.2995,4.9915,1.5612,1.2899,6.2939,1.829,0.0042,0.2091,3.3834,1.2169,3.7446,1.5044,2.629,2.5306,2.9469,2.1986,1.5428,2.1308,2.0226,4.489,2.1461,0.8968,5.2527,0.4843,4.5005,4.2152,5.2431,4.9224,7.073,3.9887,2.3971,3.1791,1.8974,4.7249,6.2974,1.6143,2.6261,5.1057,0.6712,2.8066,0.5304,4.1124,6.2693,4.9466,2.227,2.6238,3.4059,3.8629,4.7688,1.6161,0.0002,4.2237,3.9214,0.3946,4.5336,0.5391,2.1821,1.8341,1.8394,3.9767,0.3698,5.995,3.1729,0.5231,0.4495,6.8093,3.8393,2.7842,0.4967,1.9184,4.5979,4.9236,3.0501,4.4146,5.4999,1.62,0.1239,5.998,3.4735,0.8517,1.5921,6.0639,3.212,0.039,0.9855,6.1018,3.4537,1.0679,0.1358,0.2678,3.6634,1.3135,3.6258,2.8981,4.4576,3.5926,2.9369,5.0033,2.6229,5.0586,4.0468,1.0594,1.0073,0.4021,2.5364,3.3638,0.9344,4.4676,5.3912,3.8692,2.3184,1.1021,0.7227,2.9034,1.8532,1.061,0.7742,3.1816,3.1192,3.0363,2.7121,0.6996,2.2888,4.5848,3.7256,2.8046,3.1957,0.3957,1.4,0.0002,2.3923,4.3824,2.9782,3.6548,5.5899,0.2164,4.4521,2.2412,0.9931,1.474,1.4643,0.2612,3.0411,0.4905,5.3514,5.4352,3.8975,3.6804,0.1381,0.4556,3.4947,2.1379,0.199,0.1145,1.8088,1.3002,1.619,0.3243,0.0477,0.9896,0.3015,4.281,1.0003,3.5145,2.2447,3.5764,0.0257,0.5852,3.6247,7.433,1.4045,0.2754,2.5173,1.2384,5.0311,1.5483,6.2349,0.0185,5.3717,2.9624,1.6255,3.1717,5.2541,2.7645,3.1632,2.1713,1.6337,1.1321,4.5179,2.9894,4.8372,1.7858,4.2602,0.271,4.1654,3.8997,0.9373,1.5396,8.8457,0.429,2.8264,2.8341,1.4727,3.1918,0.0356,4.8323,4.018,1.7541,1.8843,0.3701,0.5841,0.1288,0.0061,2.5933,2.4298,3.1719,5.583,0.7936,2.9074,2.5455,1.0068,4.7351,0.2145,1.5858,3.2669,0.8831,2.1062,0.9161,4.9115,3.4828,0.0005,5.1609,5.4481,1.9796,1.0522,2.8581,0.9231,5.5844,0.1461,2.7605,7.4138,4.3495,0.6413,1.4763,

{"id":3478,"ended":true,"length":653,"gen_text":"`` Hi there. You know that feeling you sometimes have, of someone watching you just outside your line of vision? That was me. It's time we had a little chat. ''\n\n'' Oh that s-sh*t....'' The man stifled his groan.\n\n'I did say I knew you,'' the 'roids barked excitedly. ''Now come on.''\n\n'' Hey, let's do this again before lunch. ''\n\n'' Alright. How 'bout dinner? '' The man put his hand on the door, but he was stopped by the 'roids. The door creaked open, and the man stepped inside, but he didn't get a word in edgewise.\n\n'' Aaaaaah...'' The man let out a loud groan, as more and more of his body was being invaded. One of the 'roids stepped around the door, opened the window and started shooting some bullets. One of the bullets exploded and filled the room with shrapnel.\n\n'' Alright, I said, you won. Now let' s get the hell out of here!'' The man was shouting.\n\n'It took like 5 seconds after you said that, your ass got shot twice.''\n\n'' Hey, give me some of your gun! ''\n\n'' You wanna fight now?''\n\n...\n\n'' How 'bout the two ways?''\n\n'' Let's do the same thing over again, let' s see if you get up again.''\n\n''... What the **** are you doing?''\n\n'' And when you get up, you get my gun! ''\n\n'' What's you, a cop?''\n\n'' Let's do this a little more 'nto get him on his feet, then we can go do the rest.'' And that was how the battle began. A minute later the man was on his feet, and out of the window the 'roids opened fire on him, and he just stood there for a second, almost in tears. Then he stepped through the window.\n\nThere was a flash of white and the next third the man was dead!\n\n'' Oh dear God, you're right!'' He said, his eyes filling with tears. '' I thought I was going to die today.'' He stood up, grabbed his gun and walked to the elevator.\n\nHe found himself in the lobby, with two 'roids walking towards him, the one he thought killed him in the park, the one he thought he saved! The ones who helped him kill the one who tried to kill him.\n\n'' Hey, why the fuck are you talking to all of these android 'roids?'' He said. '''\n\n'' Because this was the best day of my life, thanks to you.'' The 'roids said, with that one word - and they left him alone.\n\nA little later he was walking down the street, he was in the middle of a city-wide hunt, to hunt down these two guys (who he thought helped kill him ). The story ended there, not even a single line of dialog from the two 'roids.\n\nHe couldn't remember what he did after that.\n\nThe whole thing was just like a movie, in the least. The author was so proud of it, he could even put it on an official ''official'' fan web site. At least that was what he saw himself, but who knows if he wanted to add some story for another

{"id":2603,"ended":false,"length":696,"gen_text":"Every night you fall asleep to the sound of rain coming from a noise machine app you use. One night, you hear a voice cut through the artificial rainfall. You open your eyes to discover the rain machine is still on. The sound device is switched off. You awaken to see the rain machine turned off.\n\nThe voices that you have spoken into your iPhone are coming from other people with those same iPhone sound effects. This technology is all around you and is the most intimate technology yet invented, and most of us have completely accepted it. This technology seems to exist to increase the amount of revenue that corporations can generate through advertising. When you use your iPhone every day, you have become complicit in the increasing amount of commercialism. If you did not give your permission, you may be subject to more than 40 ads a day, and may be shown ads that you probably do not want.\n\nHere are a few ideas that will help you to resist and stop the use of Sound Effects, Advertising and Audio in Your iPhone and iPad\n\nStart making Noise about IT\n\nDo you support privacy? This may be the most important issue you face and the one that will make the biggest difference. When you install an app, does it ask your permission to use your data? Does it prompt you to give permission before downloading your music, videos and so on? Does the app ask you to send you notifications or e-mails when it does something? Does it ask you to participate in surveys? Does it ask you for your e-mail address?\n\nDo any of these seem unreasonable? Or are they common practice for apps? Do your iPhone apps use your GPS data? Does your iPhone give you access to your WiFi connection? If not you are missing out on millions of dollars of revenue. You should immediately take action to stop the use of all these technology practices that have become common place in many of your apps.\n\nIf you have not already, start using the #Stop Sound effects hashtag. The goal of this movement is to get rid of the sounds that you may be surprised by during your use of an app.\n\nMake Noise about Privacy\n\nIt is one thing to have something on your iPhone that uses your data and may make you feel uncomfortable. It is another thing to have something on your iPhone that can be used to identify you. That is the ultimate goal of location tracking and the most shocking part of the world's Big Brother plans.\n\nDon't use apps that take your camera settings or data when you uninstall them, and don't install some of these applications that store information on your device. You must become aware that if your location is on the map, and if your phone does not record location for you, it may show a different one. If all of these apps that track your GPS data have your e-mail address on them, your IP address, your MAC address, your user id and much more, they take your email address and everything else you may give them a way to use to track you.\n\nHave a Voice\n\nMake noise against the increasing use of technology in your life. Make noise against how your personal information is being stored, how it is being combined, how it is being sold.

{"id":963,"ended":true,"length":656,"gen_text":"After no contact from outer space, NASA finally receives an Alien radio signal with only 7 words : `` The birds are not what they seem ''\n\nSeptember 30, 1962 \ufffd July 22, 1964... ( The radio signal was received around 7 PM and then it stopped ).\n\nSeptember 30, 1963\n\nSpacecrafts, both human and alien, begin using an interplanetary radio communication method known as interplanetary signal.\n\nNovember 16, 1962\n\nSpacecrafts and aliens have begun using interplanetary radio communication method, and the alien broadcasts are very weak. The aliens begin using two frequencies : The one transmitting to the Earth and the one transmitting on the other side of the sun.\n\nDecember 4, 1962\n\nThe radio signal from outer space, with only 7 words, is received. The word is : `` There are some things in life that are worth doing but that really ought not to be done.''\n\nDecember 5, 1962\n\nThe earth stations are receiving the radio signals from outer space, some of the signals have only a few words. The radio signals received by earth stations and on the outside of space are in a constant stream of radio voices. These voice messages from outer space are very vague.\n\nJune 8, 1964\n\nThe aliens, who have also started using interplanetary radio communication method, start broadcasting the word \". \"\n\nNovember 3, 1964\n\nAlien broadcasts increase in strength and frequency of communication. It seems that outer space, even that of the earth is broadcasting radio signals that reach the planet Venus. By December, these broadcasts and voices reach the planet Venus very faint, if at all, then only a very low frequency radio frequency broadcast, so faint as to be almost undreamed at. One broadcast can be heard at the frequency of 26.3 KHz ( kilohertz) and the voice that goes along with it is that of an American - a British man - speaking. The voice seems to be saying : \" All of the children are going to die, if you leave the atmosphere. \"\n\nJuly 20, 1964\n\nFirst alien voices at Venus.\n\nJuly 20, 1966\n\nThe radio transmissions that were heard by earth stations are even more weak, and the alien voices are no longer heard.\n\nOctober 4, 1968\n\nWith the advance of the space vehicles, alien broadcasts now reach the moon. One of the voices sounds like that of an American : \" I live in Los Angeles and, my wife is my assistant, and my two sons are my employees. My daughter and my brother-in-law are on earth. My sister is dead, dead, dead. How does that make me feel?\"\n\nJanuary 5, 1969\n\nBy this time the voices that the aliens are using in their radio broadcasts are so weak, they are not able to be heard on the moon, they only make little noises that no one can hear.\n\nDecember 12, 1970\n\nMany alien broadcasts are heard reaching Venus. These broadcast are in low frequency of 15-20 KHz ( kilohertz ). ( This indicates that the transmitting aliens were coming from the direction of the planet Venus ). It also indicates that there is no radio signal coming to the Venus from the outside of the sun. The transmissions come from a spaceship with a voice that is much more high-pitched than the signals received by terrestrial stations as they could easily be missed.\n\n\nIt seems that there are at least 5 spaceships communicating with the Venus of the solar system.\n\nOne can learn more about these alien

Paul suffers from anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is why we are helping him deal with his depression.He is very worried about being homeless, and recently posted this to our Facebook fan page:Paul said he found a \"Hobo Stash\" where people hide belongings and food when they are going through tough times. Paul has a friend who has been homeless for over ten years. He said the \"stash\" has helped the homeless friend avoid getting caught by law enforcement.He also mentioned that they do this as part of their survival skills. He said he knows a lot of people do this, and he wants us to pass the word about it on the fan page.Paul said he didn't really want to go over this topic again, but decided to share with us, since he thinks we would enjoy it. If this makes you laugh, well - so much the better.Paul's comments on his \"Stuffle\" of survival tactics:This one is pretty funny.He told us about this \"stashing\" practice, and his anxiety:When Paul posted this to his Facebook page, he also posted this to his \"Locker Room\" audience:I did ask Paul if he would be willing to let me publish a few of his photos of the stash in the hopes of helping others deal with their own inner struggles, because it is difficult to describe how overwhelming that feeling can be.I am thankful to Paul for his honesty, and hope you enjoy some of his photography! If you haven't seen his \"Locker Room\" photo yet, well, go check it out -- Paul's \"Stuffing\" might surprise you.What do you think of Paul's Stuffing techniques?

{"id":378,"ended":false,"length":706,"gen_text":"You're midway into your flight when you, feeling bored, decided to surf the Internet. You read breaking news about another plane disappearance. You're on that flight. You're in that seat. You're in that seat while everyone else is boarding because nobody wants to wait for you. You're in that seat 'cause you're too impatient to wait your turn. You're in that seat because you're not too happy with other passengers and the airplane 'cos you're not a very good air hostess. You're not getting along with others 'cos you're not very nice. You're not too sure of yourself 'cos you're not very patient. You're impatient but you're not too patient with others 'cos you're lazy. If you want your time back, you 'll have to be patient while you wait for it.'\n\nThe Internet was also an easy place for people to make friends. People who got together online were often called 'friends with benefits' since they often stayed online to help one another, so some of the other terms for those who spend too much time online in any given day and on any given occasion - those who spend too much time looking up information about something or someone - have to do with friends with benefits, too. Some even went as far as calling those who spend so much time with people online 'digital hobbits'. So while 'digital hobbits' was a good way to describe those people, it wasn't the same as saying someone who spends too much time online is always called 'digital hobbit', since even if someone were to call someone a 'digital hobbit' when they spent a lot of time with, say, a celebrity online, that person would still still be called somebody who spends too much time online. One person can be 'digital hobbit' or someone can be 'digital hobbit'. 'Digital hobbits', 'friends with benefits' and 'digital hobbits' all have different definitions.\n\n\nExamples\n\nWhile this term was very useful when it was introduced, some people aren't that pleased with using it in today's society. You've not got time for this? Don't worry, we don't have time for it either! (You won't!) Let's stay in our bedroom and play! (We won't!) If you're only going to spend so much time talking online, that just means you're boring. (Sorry) I can only really talk to you over the Internet. (But we could still be friends, right?) Sure, some of us can only talk to you over the top of the Internet. (Well, they could always talk to you face to face.) But what about our families? (We can talk to them face to face all right.)\n\nSo, is there a difference between 'digital' and 'digital hobbit'? The answer is no, unless someone is using the terms 'digital hobbit' and 'digital', 'digital' and 'digital hobbit' to describe the same person!\n\nAnother person once asked me, \"How should I say \"I spend time online looking up news\"? (I spend time online researching...)?\" I said \"Why shouldn't you say 'I'm 'Digital Hobbits' and you're 'digital hobbits'?' You spend time online to find new information, don't you?

{"id":3790,"ended":false,"length":706,"gen_text":"You're midway into your flight when you, feeling bored, decided to surf the Internet. You read breaking news about another plane disappearance. You're on that flight. You're in that seat. You're in that seat while everyone else is boarding because nobody wants to wait for you. You're in that seat 'cause you're too impatient to wait your turn. You're in that seat because you're not too happy with other passengers and the airplane 'cos you're not a very good air hostess. You're not getting along with others 'cos you're not very nice. You're not too sure of yourself 'cos you're not very patient. You're impatient but you're not too patient with others 'cos you're lazy. If you want your time back, you 'll have to be patient while you wait for it.'\n\nThe Internet was also an easy place for people to make friends. People who got together online were often called 'friends with benefits' since they often stayed online to help one another, so some of the other terms for those who spend too much time online in any given day and on any given occasion - those who spend too much time looking up information about something or someone - have to do with friends with benefits, too. Some even went as far as calling those who spend so much time with people online 'digital hobbits'. So while 'digital hobbits' was a good way to describe those people, it wasn't the same as saying someone who spends too much time online is always called 'digital hobbit', since even if someone were to call someone a 'digital hobbit' when they spent a lot of time with, say, a celebrity online, that person would still still be called somebody who spends too much time online. One person can be 'digital hobbit' or someone can be 'digital hobbit'. 'Digital hobbits', 'friends with benefits' and 'digital hobbits' all have different definitions.\n\n\nExamples\n\nWhile this term was very useful when it was introduced, some people aren't that pleased with using it in today's society. You've not got time for this? Don't worry, we don't have time for it either! (You won't!) Let's stay in our bedroom and play! (We won't!) If you're only going to spend so much time talking online, that just means you're boring. (Sorry) I can only really talk to you over the Internet. (But we could still be friends, right?) Sure, some of us can only talk to you over the top of the Internet. (Well, they could always talk to you face to face.) But what about our families? (We can talk to them face to face all right.)\n\nSo, is there a difference between 'digital' and 'digital hobbit'? The answer is no, unless someone is using the terms 'digital hobbit' and 'digital', 'digital' and 'digital hobbit' to describe the same person!\n\nAnother person once asked me, \"How should I say \"I spend time online looking up news\"? (I spend time online researching...)?\" I said \"Why shouldn't you say 'I'm 'Digital Hobbits' and you're 'digital hobbits'?' You spend time online to find new information, don't you?

{"id":2150,"ended":true,"length":692,"gen_text":"The God-like being `` Q '' has just flung the Enterprise D to a galaxy far outside the Milky Way -- and a million years into the past. While trying to get their bearings, the crew are hailed with an offer of assistance by a small round ship. The captain identifies himself only as `` Vader ''.\n\nCaptain Tuck in the role of `` Q'' (played by Peter Cushing), is able to make contact with the starship, although she has no ship identification to call him by.\n\nThis could not be an entirely easy job for Captain Tuck, who is not so sure of himself as to feel he has the skill and the courage he would need to command a ship of this sort. So his confidence is shaken, and he begins to doubt the credibility of the people who offer to help. The crew of the spacefarer are also less assured.\n\nCaptain Tuck, of course, may have more experience at commanding such a ship, although he can't be certain. But he is determined to see the mission through, and he soon makes arrangements to meet with the ship's pilot, who will be his crewmate in this new mission. After some pleasantries have been made regarding his experience as captain of a starship, Captain Tuck invites the pilot aboard the D. He will become part of the new crew, and he too will have his name recorded on the ship's ship registry.\n\nAs they sail through the galaxy, the Enterprise D comes under attack from an unknown foe. Not only will the enemy inflict serious damage on the ship, but it will threaten to destroy the D if it stays where it is at the moment.\n\nWhen Captain Tuck learns that this mysterious foe -- a being of unspeakable power and malice- -- is threatening the lives of the ship's crew, he begins to have a change of heart. He agrees to cooperate with their pursuers, and he helps them to infiltrate the mysterious intruder.\n\nCaptain Tuck's actions in this matter are extremely prudent and, in fact, heroic. He refuses to make rash decisions; for this reason, he must be allowed to explore the unknown. His conduct is so honorable that when Captain Tuck is captured, Captain Spock has no difficulty using torture to bring him to his senses. He is released from prison and given a new crew, and Captain Tuck travels back to Earth with them.\n\nThis time, Captain Tuck is not the one being put to a test by the authorities, but the people who had accepted and accepted his offer of aid.\n\nThey are none other than the three friends whom he saved in \"The Trouble With Tribbles,\" with who, he is sure, the Enterprise D can learn much in the voyage that they have embarked upon.\n\nCaptain Tuck is still Captain Tuck, of course, but he has grown comfortable with the responsibilities of a command. And he is ready to fulfill them. (He also is determined to honor his promise to give the Enterprise D \"the greatest possible help for its mission\" and to do everything he can to keep it from harm -- including accepting a position in Starfleet.)\n\nAll in the name of helping Starfleet out of a jam.\n\nThis is perhaps the best \"Star Trek\" I have ever read, and it stands out as great and true classic cinema science fiction. It has not been translated into other languages and has yet to be reworked into a movie. Perhaps someday it will be -- although it has been nearly 27 years since any of my fellow science fiction buffs in the United States or abroad could possibly have seen

{"id":234,"ended":false,"length":693,"gen_text":"There's someone in my head but it's not me... I couldn't do it. I just couldn 't. I wouldn 't admit it. I couldn' t say that I knew.\"\n\nByrne's story is not a unique one. An estimated 70,000 people suffer from depersonalisation disorder. Depersonalisation disorder is a chronic condition that is characterized by extreme feelings of detachment or \"out of body\" experiences. In the case of Patrick Byrne, being an actor forced him to leave the people who were most important to him; he retreated to a box inside his head.\n\nByrne's diagnosis of depersonalisation disorder has had a profound long-term effect on his relationships with the people in his life. It has forced him to face his demons head-on, and to take responsibility for his actions. He began to talk to an array of people about the experience, who have helped him come to terms with his issues. His brother Mark, a retired police officer, helped him to get on with his life. His friends, like Martin, also have helped him to move on from this horrible experience.\n\nMark Byrne admits that he wasn't aware of the impact his brother's experience with Depersonalisation Disorder is having on his ability to function. He was not aware that Patrick had been having nightmares, anxiety disorders and other difficulties over the course of his journey. Patrick's brother Mark is now more prepared to ask Patrick questions, and to support him at every turn he can. It has also made it easier for Patrick himself to share his story.\n\n\"I'm so glad I had this experience. It has been my little secret, it's not a big deal.\" I am glad that my brother is aware of it now... Patrick Byrne\n\nIn fact, Patrick's experiences have informed how he feels about coming forward. His brother Mark said: \"The shame was so great, it was overwhelming for me. Coming out as depersonalised, it was like coming out as homosexual. My biggest fear was that Patrick did not accept it. I did not know how to do it, you 'd be lying if you said you were just scared and didn 't know how to deal with it.\"\n\nPatrick's experience has now made him much more open to reaching out to people who may be suffering from this disorder. He knows that there, he is not alone. He has been able to connect to a group of people who have faced the same ordeal as him that he faced, and who have gained a new appreciation for his situation.\n\nI wanted to believe that I could overcome this, that I could find a way out... I had to get out of bed, I had to talk to someone, I had to do something, to take a leap of faith, and start accepting my illness. This is my journey, in the end, but I'm proud to say that he did it as well. It took me time to get off the couch (after coming out as depersonalised)... I told my sister what had been going on and how I felt, and she was supportive. I told my mom (who died two years ago when Patrick was 12) she deserved to know.

{"id":1016,"ended":false,"length":631,"gen_text":"Your job is to give a fledgling AI a sense of morality.\n\nIs your game in the way?\n\n\nIt's the same thing, but in reverse. In short: you are the AI and you are trying to figure out how to treat the human as your fellow humans. In order to do that, you must first understand the world so that you can make any decision.\n\nIs it possible to have artificial morality without giving human characters human-like emotions?\n\nAIs won't have human emotions. That's why AIs can't feel the pain and fear of humans or have relationships with humans. They will only see humans as the objects of their research.\n\n\nI'm currently writing a paper about AI ethics using the model above. You can find more details about the model and my methodology can be found in the papers section of the blog.\n\nDo you have any advice for someone using AI in their own work?\n\nThe most important thing for anyone who works in AI or uses AIs in any way is to make sure they understand what AI is and why they are doing what they are doing.\n\nPeople use very vague terms like \"moral reasoning\" to give themselves the feel-good feeling which will lead them to do dangerous things.\n\nYou do not need to be a \"computational philosopher\" to understand AI. All you need to do is understand AI and the world around you.\n\nIn order to understand moral reasoning, ask yourself: \"what are human values?\" Do your actions reflect what you believe is right or wrong? Do you have a goal? Do you have a good enough reason to live?\n\nAlso, I would say that people can do all kinds of stupid things in their daily lives and that if someone is worried about being judged for something like that, you should ask yourself why this person is likely to be judged. The answer will often be that they are not good people.\n\nMost people, if you talk to them about human values, will tell you their own values. A human being's own value is the value that they feel they hold toward themselves.\n\nIn order to do this, you need to be self-aware: you have to try and think about what is good for you first before you try to think about what is good for others.\n\nPeople who really want to understand morality will do their research, go to conferences with other moral philosophers, read books like Derek Parfit's Reasons and Persons, and meet others like them.\n\nYou can also support research in AI and AI safety by writing to DARPA and NIST.\n\nYou can also learn more about human values by reading these references:\n\nThe moral life of children\n\nA person's \"core values\"\n\nWhy most of modern society seems to be based on false premises\n\nHuman rights and non-human animal rights\n\nCitation for this article:\n\nRiley, J.

I have been lucky to never have to use a gas mask in my time as a medic, and I think that's part of the reason why it was so startling. Now I live with the horror.\n\nIt is a horrible thing, gas chamber gas chambers. Imagine if it actually happens.\n\nA New York City man who spent five years inside a Nazi concentration camp survived by making his own gas mask from cardboard. Charles Shulgin, who was a chemistry graduate student at University of California at San Diego when he arrived at Auschwitz in 1942, said he was allowed to make and keep the mask out of kindness, because he was a member of the experimental research group that designed the gas chambers. He left his lab there in April 1945 and spent the rest of the war in a prison camp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nShulgin, 83, was awarded the Medal of Merit for his work on a technique to remove the poisonous compound from marijuana and cannabis oil (shaken-leaf cannabis). The chemical, THCA, is commonly found in cannabis which is extracted from the plant. He said he made the oxygen mask while working on a similar molecule, called 3,4-dichloropropane, for a different research group. When he returned to the camp in April 1945 after three months in the gas chamber, he discovered it was still in use. \"You could see the stench from the place,\" Shulgin told the Guardian. He remembered a fellow Nazi who told him, \"You must be able to find a place where we can put the masks in for transport.\" The Nazi didn't want any Nazi's wearing the masks, Shulgin told the Guardian, because the Nazis were \"obsessed with being identified with the gas chambers and with the killing of the Jews.\"\n\nCharles Shulgin makes an oxygen mask for a member of the experimental research group. Photo via Wikipedia\n\nShulgin returned to the camp and was soon granted permission to make his own mask, but he was quickly sent back to the camp. When he returned he found several of the research group had already made the masks. He asked the camp's commandant about their purpose and was told, \"They want to get rid of us!\" Shulgin, 83, recalled, \"People were dying of suffocation from the fumes of the gas cylinders.... I started to see that there was really a need for more effective means of gas delivery.\" One of the more creative ideas he came up with involved mixing rubber tubing with an aluminum nitrate-dioxide cylinder, creating a pressurized gas \"shower,\" he said. Instead of forcing the gas down someone's nose, it was forced up a gas slide onto a gas cylinder, blowing the rubber tube out of the cylinder.\n\nShulgin, in an op-ed in the Guardian, detailed the history of research into a gas mask as early as the early 1900's, when some French scientists began experimenting with chemical warfare and toxic gases. By the end of World War I, a chemical warfare expert was convinced a gas mask was an ideal means of preventing injury from chemical weapons. Gas masks were used by German troops in World War I, and by the end of World War II, the U.S. Army had developed its own gas mask. Although the British did not adopt the gas mask for use in Iraq before the 2003 invasion, they did adopt an early gas mask for use in combat in Afghanistan, the Guardian

{"id":2732,"ended":true,"length":695,"gen_text":"You arrive in heaven\/hell and find out you get one phone call... your father calls to ask are you coming to dinner or... (it's all very sad because...) and then he hangs up. I knew we were in for a long night. The next morning I woke up and there were hundreds of people around us. About 20 of them were friends and family. The rest were all strangers saying, 'Oh what's up man! Is everything all right? Are you gonna talk? Are you gonna have fun?' The first thought was, wait, who were these people? The second one was, they had no way to contact me, so I was the messenger of god, which is pretty dope. I asked God to hold me and asked Him to give me five minutes to explain some stuff. I'm talking like a 4-year-old, no, but I can get my message across, and that's what I did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow many of the crowd were there to see you play live?\n\n\nIt wasn't really live, it was for the internet. I had like 5,000 people in attendance, that was pretty cool. I'm talking about the people who came to see me play live, which was so cool.\n\nIs there anything your father would have wanted you to highlight during the show?\n\n\nYeah he always wanted me to get better and always wanted me to leave with an education. When I was about 10 years old, that's what he was telling me and it still resonates with me. It's very easy to get lost in all the stuff in the outside world and not think about what your job is. I feel very fortunate at my age that I found God at the right age and that I am a born preacher. So, I'm extremely grateful for that. I just felt that those things, those things I should remember.\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what's it like with kids these days?\n\n\nI love kids. I feel like I've been preaching to kids, it was just so awesome to be able to do the internet show. I had so many emails that were just so excited that their parents were going to hear what I had to say. The fact that I had one phone call came so much for me and I think just being on the internet where I'm kind of anonymous I really want to kind of take that away. I'm not going to lie, it's hard to explain but it definitely kind of made me feel that I was so famous. You can only think about that for so long and so I try to focus on the things I need to focus on.\n\n\"It all started with a conversation with my daughter about what God was like.\"\n\nSo you are still the same person you always were, right?\n\nOh god, the only person I see change is my daughter. It's like no new person I can be. This is just a very, very sad day for me. It's probably going to be a really long day. There won't be any laughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did you pick that name?\n\n\nYeah, I'm realy cool with it and I'm glad it worked.\n\nWhat's your message to your father?\n\n\nDad, I love you. I love you so much. Don't try to lie to me. You know what I mean? Don't try to manipulate me to be like what you want. Don't do something that can hurt your family for anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hope his children all know who you really

{"id":2785,"ended":false,"length":651,"gen_text":"You are struggling to write a poem because it is almost impossible for you to rhyme. You write in anger about how difficult it is only to find that you were rhyming the entire time. You feel guilty for not using the correct rymes or missing out the right words to add to your poem. You cannot get any writing done until you come up with enough to work with, otherwise your brain will switch into auto-pilot.\n\n. You write in anger about how difficult it is only to find that you were, and. You feel guilty for not using the correct rymes or missing out the right words to add to your poem. You cannot get any writing done until you come up with enough to work with, otherwise your brain will switch into. You have a headache the entire day. If you have a chronic headache, you will tend to overthink things while you try to sleep.\n\nThe list goes on and on, but it's really the same pattern every month. You find yourself with mental blocks, and there's nothing you can do to get through them, so you continue with the same way of thinking. It turns yourself into a helpless addict trapped in a self-imposed state of misery.\n\nYou know what's really tough? Trying your best to get healthy, eat a healthy diet, exercise and rest properly every day. The mental health symptoms can affect you just like your physical symptoms.\n\nYou may be surprised to learn the two don't go hand in hand. If you focus your energy on mental wellness, you will naturally see that your eating disorder is getting better while your mental symptoms are getting better. If you can eat and exercise properly, you can also get rid of your eating disorder and start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nIn my book, I explain my treatment methodology, which is based upon a cognitive behavioural therapy approach that focuses on improving your sense of self. You begin to see how different you are from those around you because you will automatically remember what you did each time you did something. You can also discover what it was that you did that made other people mad.\n\nIn my treatment method, you not only learn to see how your behavior made the people around you feel, you also see that you are doing the right thing even as you're not totally sure if you can do it. You discover that your actions will give you a sense of accomplishment, yet you know you will fail in the end because you didn't really want to succeed.\n\nWhen I'm taking care of mental health, my focus is on improving your self-image because you deserve to be happy and fulfilled by yourself, not by your problems that others have created for you.\n\nYou may be wondering \u2014 Why would anyone take a two-hour class like mine just to become mentally healthy?\n\nThe simple answer? Getting free from your eating disorder takes time away from you for other things. In order to be mentally healthy, learning new skills, exercise, and working with a therapist gives you more time in the day \u2013 something that no matter how hard you work, you will never get back

{"id":1463,"ended":true,"length":685,"gen_text":"A Jewish man in a concentration camp has stolen a pistol, but it has only one round... and one more in the chamber.\n\n\nIt goes without saying that the prisoner's luck will run out soon, and the gun will be removed.\n\nCan you think of a situation where your lucky shot would have saved someone's life?\n\nThat's the premise behind the game. The player must find three hidden letters on each floor, and each letter leads to a special power-up.\n\nA small, quick game, it will have you smiling all over your screen every time you get a hint.\n\nIn each case, the letter you'll be playing the letter will be an easy one or a hard one.\n\nWith more than 80 levels to try, and 8 levels added since this was announced (including its recent update), this is a game that you won't find too late. It's well worth picking up right now, and it'll probably remain so for a very long time... because it's just so funny.\n\nThis is a fun, casual game that's just a few button presses away from being played by your teenage kids. It's a great idea for a party game, and the wordplay and humor will keep you engaged right the way until the punch is delivered.\n\nNow we just need the game to make it onto Kickstarter.\n\n\"Duckman\" (above) launched into a successful Kickstarter campaign as a solo indie game in February 2005. The game proved to be extremely popular, and it has since been featured on numerous magazines, publications, and websites as a platformer, puzzle game, RPG, and platformer.\n\n\n\"Duckman\" is the tale of a tiny duck which has been left behind by a giant crocodile, where he finds refuge in a strange house. He must find out why the house is here, what the house is, and where he's supposed to go when he's ready.\n\n\nTo do that, he makes friends with the house's residents, who have their own agendas: one wants to stay the night at the house, the other isn't sure how to get there without the duck, and the third is looking for Duckman.\n\n\nThe action is all about platforming and exploration, and the environments are a real treat. You will come across caves, ruins, gardens, and more in each level. As you progress through the story, you encounter Duckman's nemesis, a dragon, who will be trying anything to stop his escape.\n\n\nAs you progress through the story, you can collect collectibles that give Duckman hints on where to go. Some items can only be collected in certain areas, so that there's enough time to explore and uncover everything.\n\nFor the most part, most of the items are relatively straightforward; a little puzzle will involve moving a block to a different position in a room, or the like \u2013 but since most of the levels are fairly small in their scope, you will have to be pretty quick with your finger (or at least with the D-pad) to navigate some of the rooms.\n\n\nThere are a few \"hidden\" items to collect \u2013 a few blueprints to go on to work with, a few letters hidden behind some puzzle pieces, and more.

{"id":735,"ended":false,"length":628,"gen_text":"You jokingly recite an incantation. It worked. \"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"You jokingly recite an incantation and make it work!\"\n\n\"I did what?\"\n\n\"You recite an incantation and make it work! That is the secret.\"\n\n\"...You're so sure of yourself.\"\n\nI've been looking for the incantation for a long time and can't find it.\n\n\"Is there something else we can play with?\"\n\nI can't find the incantation for something I made myself. That's why I ask with a smile.\n\n...Yeah, that's it. I know what to do.\n\nA big rock falls from the sky. It breaks the ground and my heart can beat no more.\n\n\"You did it! I'm so happy, Shirohebi!\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm so happy that I won't eat anymore!\"\n\n\"It's a great honor for us. A new life for Shirohebi, like this!\"\n\n\"Yeah, your life is very convenient for me.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I like eating every single day because it allows me to get stronger. It's a good excuse to eat every day without any worry.\"\n\n\"You're wrong.\"\n\n\"Wah! You're right, Shirohebi. As long as you eat every day, you will continue to get stronger.\"\n\nShirohebi laughs loudly. Maybe because he has no memories.\n\nI don't understand. When did I become this strong?\n\nShirohebi, when did you become so strong?\n\nShirohebi is the first to say that he's not sure about himself. He knows for sure that he will not eat anymore. The only thing that makes sense is his ability with the incantation.\n\nI can't believe that he has been fighting for over ten years. He has not had to fight because he's the strongest of the monsters of the world. This isn't what I expected at all.\n\nIf it was possible, I would have found him and had one last fight. If that had happened, I think I would have lost. I don't want to lose now.\n\n\"I want to challenge Shirohebi!\"\n\n\"Do you think you can even beat him?\"\n\nShirohebi laughs and then walks away.\n\nI turn back toward the monster. Is this how he wants our battle to be like this?\n\n\"Shirohebi's a scary monster, but also a lot of fun. He's scary at first, but after we talk he lets everyone know that he's a good person.\"\n\nI see no difference in terms of being a good person or not.\n\n\"Let's meet again!\"\n\n\"The same place will be for us.\"\n\n... I don't mind losing. This isn't how I expected to fight with Shirohebi.\n\nMaybe I was born to lose.\n\nIf it was possible, I would have let go of Shirohebi long ago. But because of a curse, I don't feel that is going to happen.\n\n...Even so, I want to fight.\n\nIf I don't, it will be even harder to forgive myself.\n\nShirohebi has lost his mind. I hope that it will never come back.\n\n<Previous Chapter | Imouto | Next

{"id":2036,"ended":true,"length":722,"gen_text":"Your friend asks you to pinch him, just to make sure he isn't dreaming. Well, he WAS dreaming and now he woke up, but you stay where you are.\n\nYour daughter was in the bathtub when you waked up.\n\nYour spouse is in the office all day working, wondering how she has time for you to be with her.\n\nYour spouse wants to have sex, but you do not want to join her. Now, you say \"I just didn't feel like it!\". Of course, you felt that way, because, you're the one who has taken all the responsibility. So now, all your plans were shattered!\n\nYour child is on a school trip, visiting a friend & wants to stay the night at your place. Your husband & wife agree. As a result, your daughter leaves you, & you come home early morning. But her friend stays there for 4 days. Well, she wants to leave, but your husband won't allow it. So, you have to deal with this, and so many other problems. You stay with your children all day, while your husband is at work. Your spouse won't go on a trip, because he won't have his car. Then, you get a call from your daughter asking for help because her friend's parents have lost their job ( because of the recession ). You then spend the entire day trying to explain to her that the friend is missing, she is home alone, she's the one who has got in trouble because, her parents are out of work. That's just the beginning, but this one episode will leave a scar on you. It has also made you think - Is it possible for a relationship? Can a relationship survive, after all these things? I won't even start my own stories, because all you'll get yourself in is trouble, trouble that will lead to many more issues. All that you will be left with is the fact that your relationship will not survive what you suffered in the past. You will also have to deal with all the consequences of your decisions during that time, like:\n\na) You will have to deal with your husband's guilt. He took responsibility for the situation, so it isn't your fault. So, do you wish you had not asked him for help? Will his guilt lead to more trouble?\n\nb) You will have to deal with being on the receiving end of all the arguments of your husband. All the time you are away from him, you will be feeling frustrated, stressed, lonely, but he will not be able to understand that. You must then accept that if it is your fault that your relationship ended, then you must also accept that it will be your fault again.\n\nc) Your children will be forced to take the blame. Some of them will take on your responsibilities, while the rest look for excuses, hoping that your husband will take responsibility for the situation, so that no one will be able to blame them.\n\nd) Your husband may have to deal with all the pain that he has caused you. He will have to live with the scars from the past, so that you don't have to. Well, some scars are not so easy to get rid of.\n\ne) You will have no one to blame but yourself! The only person who can make you feel better is yourself.\n\nIn short, you will be blamed for all the problems that happened in your marriage \/ relationship.

{"id":2402,"ended":false,"length":691,"gen_text":"Diseases can be induced to separate from their host and take physical form. The host is cured if the disease is killed in its induced form. The graver the disease, the more monstrous the form it takes. A team of doctors decide to try and save a gravely ill child.\n\nA plague that has mutated into a massive tentacled creature.\n\nThe cure is found and the child is freed from its evil.\n\nA scientist that's been tasked by a government scientist to research new drugs with potentially revolutionary results. He begins researching some drug he claims has cured the plague.\n\nThe government chemist turns on him and forces him to reveal the cure. The scientist has no choice but to do as he's told. This new form of the plague appears to be deadly, but he's never tested on humans before.\n\nHe starts with a simple batch of drug which only gives one day to last. The doctor starts to notice a slow change in the child and he goes into quarantine. The government chemist tries to stop him but is unable. He then begins working on what will be his greatest creation to date.\n\nBefore the drug can reach treatment, things go terribly wrong. People begin dying in their homes. A family in the treatment centre tries to get help for their dying daughter. They're not allowed to leave the building.\n\nThe scientist realizes they won't be able to stop the plague from spreading and he has no choice but to work with the only way he can, the cure. He creates his poison which kills the disease once and for all, but is deadly to both the host and the survivor.\n\nAn underground lab with a huge, deadly plague. The cure will now be done underground and will only be released through the use of an explosive.\n\nA doctor, who has been left in charge of a desperate house after their mother and sister are killed by an army. One girl survives her injuries in the house which is then used as a lab. She is eventually moved to a secret military base for further treatment.\n\nIt seems the government will not release the cure until after the military have finished testing it on thousands of children.\n\nThe doctor is forced to use his newly developed cure on the thousands of children, not knowing until the last child is born what the effects of the new cure will have on them!\n\nAfter a few days, the military comes and releases the cure. The plague turns into millions of virulent locusts that quickly spread and attack all of London.\n\nThe final fate of the children lies in the hands of the brave child doctors that saved London from the plague.\n\nAll in all it's a pretty good watch, however I feel that the story was a bit too slow to be that good. It felt a bit more like a 'novel' than a film. The cast was all decent all-round, but they could have done a lot more to improve the characters and make them more unique to look at. A few of the scenes were a bit too fast-paced, but no one complaining here. It's a good film to start the week ahead of something, no matter how slow it may be in terms of animation. It's worth a watch!\n\nI could see this being a great film to help kids get excited for some fantasy cartoons, but also for kids to have a bit of a closer look at history.

{"id":1112,"ended":false,"length":732,"gen_text":"You work as a telephone scammer. One day at work, you realise you have accidentally managed to call God, and he is believing your story hook, line, and sinker. You are asked to call in the way that God wants you to, and you need to tell people how you have been robbed. You should never call the cops, as that would be too easy a way of getting into trouble. What you should do instead is phone God, and he will tell you how He is to answer your enquiries. God will also ask where he got the money from, and what he wants for your body. You have to pick up the conversation, and make up some answers that will be believable to God. As for where God got the money, just say that the man had given it to you, because he was rich and generous, and that he didn't have time to keep track of it. But if it wasn't a donation, make your parents, brother, cousin, boss, neighbour or anyone else believe that you got it from your parents. Just make up things about his friends, so that you sound good. Also, make up any story about how you get your shoes from the mall, just to keep the conversation going. This is a way of having free money. God will probably demand a bribe, but don't be too hasty. If God asks you to repay your debt, send the money to where you want it. If God asks you to give him something in return, do the same. It makes perfect sense to send your parents the money they had saved for you that day. What you get from doing it is free money, because you are giving it to your parents - God himself will save them the expense of handing it over, so their children will not have to contribute. You should never take the money from where it was originally supposed to go, and never keep it yourself, just in case. The worst thing that you can do is call the cops on the guy! You don't want to get into trouble for this one, even if it was a good idea to do that one. What you should have said to God, is not that you had been robbed. Instead, you should have said that you were a good Christian and God was pleased that you were a part of his congregation. He would then forgive you. If He had only been kind to you that day. If you think that being on the hook for 20,000 dollars to your parents sounds bad, wait until you get the real story!\nYou should call up a friend to take care of the insurance. You should also be careful when it comes to insurance companies. You should always stay cautious when dealing with insurance companies, because you never know who to believe. Insurance claims are a minefield all by themselves, and they are not done that often...\nYou should have your car insured for the total amount of the accident. If your car is damaged, they will ask for the total of all damages and ask you to pay in installments. Then in the following years, since you have paid off the insurance, they will ask for more money. Just to be sure that you won't be caught in such situations, please inform your insurance company when you buy your vehicle that you will be getting new insured for the next several years. This way your coverage will not be terminated anytime soon.\nAs for a car loan, when you will be getting a loan, always make sure to ask him or her who is behind the loan.

{"id":1517,"ended":true,"length":656,"gen_text":"There once was an egg named Albert. He lived inside a chicken. Or a duck. Or a goat. His name is now taken by the eggplant. Or by the bison.\n\nOr by the eggplant, which is the only vegetable that has an official word for its fleshy shell. The eggplants we eat today began life as eggplants, and they have the same ancestors.\n\nEggplant\n\nWhen early European settlers first came upon these plants growing wild in the mountains of Mexico, they were astonished. The eggplant is not one thing, it is many; a vegetable salad made for any occasion, a soup, a dish\u2014or, of course, any stew or soup. Eggs are what makes the eggplant what it is.\n\nOne-quarter of this little plant is edible, but it's really the largest, most flavorful part. It's called the egg, and there's a reason for the difference between a egg and its edible cousin.\n\nEgg vs. Eggplant\n\nIf you ate an egg and a vegetable for dinner\u2014what would they look like? There's really only one way to find out. Take a good eggplant, lay it flat, cut across the center, then pick up a whole egg. Place it on your own eggplant. The two pieces will fall together without friction and become one.\n\nIf you do the same thing with an eggplant, instead of picking up as many slices as you can, you will find each slice to be a whole egg, and that's when you know you've reached the end, and you can stop.\n\nEggplant and Eggs\n\nIn Mexico, eggs are called eggplant; they're the same thing. An eggplant is sometimes called a zapata, where an egg is a zapata; eggplant is an eggplant; eggplant is a zapeta. Eggplant and eggs are one big family.\n\nAlthough some people think you can't have an eggplant without an egg, this is not true. To make a vegetarian eggplant salad, you can simply throw the skin away; you can roast an eggplant in a frying pan with olive oil, garlic, fresh herbs, and salt. That is certainly a vegetarian eggplant salad.\n\nA Vegetarian Eggplant Salad\n\nEggplant is really a vegetable salad, but it's not vegetarian. To be sure, it's actually vegetarian, but it's definitely not vegetarian. The eggplant itself is usually used. You can toss your vegetables on top of the eggplant, then simply eat it with salt and pepper.\n\nYou can also serve eggplant with potatoes, pasta or rice\u2014even mashed sweet potatoes. Eggplant is a great salad for anyone, not just vegetarians. It's one of the easiest to prepare, one of the healthiest, and one of the most satisfying dishes to enjoy in the springtime when the plants have ripened and the flowers are in full color. It's often called the \"mild winter vegetable.\" It's as great as lettuce or spinach, and it's one of the few food groups in which you can get a lot of vitamin C, which your body needs for strong bones and joints.\n\nA side salad made with a bit of olive oil, vinegar, herbs, and salt is terrific for the eggplant, too. It's a traditional springtime snack or side dish that could even be served as a dinner side salad on its own. Just do whatever makes you happy, but it will never have the same appeal when served without its fruit and veggies.","token_len":742,"entropy":[9.4001,0.1597,2.8352,6.502,5.197,7.4166,1.2492,1.824,2.718,4.1964,0.9318,5.3455,1.4942,6.6305,2.7387,2.2879,0.3794,0.4235,0.3668,3.6342,0.1469,4.8821,0.7876,2.4817,2.8368,5.8727,0.9737,1.3952,3.0745,5.8331,1.2088,3.4768,2.9403,0.5032,5.6077,3.7441,0.337,2.7289,0.0054,3.7282,1.1069,0.4163,4.0697,0.9671,3.1008,2.5621,1.0555,2.6977,3.2112,1.7382,1.4666,2.4616,3.7213,1.1314,5.0975,0.8325,2.5325,5.2548,1.2618,4.3148,0.4417,2.509,1.8808,3.9932,0.0073,2.7054,1.1863,1.1454,5.3234,2.2353,0.3908,2.2836,0.5639,0.0003,1.0716,2.0197,2.0597,2.3952,3.9283,0.7779,5.2593,1.7479,1.6341,0.0002,2.7151,0.0307,0.6875,5.1761,0.0002,4.3904,5.8245,3.4961,0.7253,2.4543,2.119,3.2485,2.8798,2.5164,2.8703,0.6756,0.6258,0.8615,3.7428,0.7649,2.2653,0.2527,0.1228,2.063,3.3457,1.0404,1.9385,1.8476,1.1383,2.4489,2.8354,3.9905,5.4124,1.2555,1.7064,0.8336,1.4673,5.0969,1.7998,2.9796,4.8712,4.4426,5.3017,4.8651,0.6509,1.1011,1.5796,4.5943,1.557,0.2797,3.5705,6.9424,2.4092,2.2762,3.6337,0.0056,0.0053,5.4233,6.2339,1.9981,2.3514,0.7084,4.3639,1.3738,4.4386,2.9342,1.422,0.3984,0.0189,2.3315,0.0052,0.0038,0.4081,0.8521,0.0002,5.1206,4.7944,2.9682,0.4581,4.5805,4.6632,1.8606,1.1181,2.0165,0.8839,1.9998,2.143,2.2743,3.9804,1.2696,5.9718,3.5932,1.1238,2.3467,0.1665,0.6799,1.8923,1.003,3.1349,0.3243,2.7865,3.8847,1.0881,4.546,1.0219,1.5346,0.9199,0.4872,3.0178,5.5447,1.9384,2.9165,4.438,0.7142,4.455,1.7824,1.8094,0.6879,1.1239,0.0002,1.7346,0.0078,7.2711,0.0371,0.4652,0.024,0.1658,0.0002,4.235,0.2393,5.2049,1.3688,0.1479,2.7236,1.767,1.9487,4.0263,1.2583,4.7833,3.9473,0.4345,2.5714,1.2307,0.0204,0.1244,4.9149,0.8962,3.8957,1.4046,0.0666,0.6623,0.0519,0.5758,0.01,0.539,3.1889,0.9446,3.4132,4.0525,0.2109,0.9954,5.4765,0.0622,1.7966,1.4377,2.6007,5.1297,0.2242,2.107,0.8616,2.6868,4.9669,2.3701,1.7971,3.7193,0.1922,1.2661,3.9913,1.5342,0.7486,2.8815,6.1321,0.516,0.061,1.2846,3.097,3.2418,4.1764,1.5553,5.4798,1.2151,3.9868,4.3453,2.9209,4.0465,0.7673,0.443,1.3339,0.0003,2.675,0.3805,3.6792,1.0374,0.0525,1.2972,0.1943,0.4451,0.0262,0.0764,0.4029,5.2104,0.035,2.3126,0.3275,8.2291,0.5866,3.3817,0.1593,0.2934,1.1379,0.4958,1.4447,2.5221,1.6817,5.2292,0.8008,2.4967,0.1956,1.5331,3.1106,0.1427,2.474,2.3348,3.1387,0.6432,3.5406,0.3196,0.5385,1.1012,0.7377,5.3444,0.3489,2.5485,5.52,1.5502,1.1889,1.7328,1.9567,1.1463,0.5405,0.0002,1.9017,0.0122,0.4014,2.4341,2.3934,0.1724,0.0002,3.5089,2.5163,0.282,2.2415,0.6538,1.7884,3.5809,1.1176,3.8875,2.6845,1.1787,2.7005,0.56,0.4573,0.3381,5.4191,0.1367,0.1412,0.5264,5.4818,0.2913,0.796,4.1617,1.2658,2.9924,0.7934,6.7209,4.7021,0.1105,0.2993,1.1639,0.6226,0.0407,0.1432,4.0925,3.8971,0.3532,0.4199,3.4258,0.5278,1.2696,2.1136,1.3241,0.4239,0.1299,1.2159,0.2496,0.0245,6.5099,0.4607,4.2865,0.1755,1.8387,0.5655,0.5486,2.8917,4.7759,1.7918,0.5787,0.5207,0.0002,5.9321,4.1558,1.3905,2.0721,4.5994,0.3359,1.0571,2.0576,1.059,0.0655,0.3143,0.6139,0.558,0.0059,0.929,2.5445,0.4679,0.6878,0.4779,0.1312,4.9391,1.7446,1.4638,4.3995,0.4225,0.0162,1.9398,0.2061,1.2193,0.9575,3.0919,3.7328,1.6685,5.7451,2.9679,3.6223,2.2885,0.6425,4.2132,2.1222,0.0209,0.0402,2.3751,1.7211,3.5203,0.0018,1.7553,2.3318,0.0021,1.2237,2.1889,0.2095,5.1568,0.9075,0.2389,0.4543,1.2625,2.302,4.1544,2.9513,6.1951,1.1454,0.8717,0.4471,0.0111,0.0798,0.3903,0.4552,0.0002,3.7961,2.6905,0.2335,0.3897,0.0094,0.1603,0.1471,0.0002,2.4206,0.0082,0.1236,1.2075,4.8748,1.2111,1.6932,1.6381,1.1537,1.7554,0.9335,0.9179,1.7713,2.893,0.3555,3.3422,1.9296,3.5622,0.2735,1.387,0.779,5.6261,3.349,1.6058,0.7637,1.0867,0.6498,4.9017,0.2029,0.666,0.2828,2.7787,1.4183,0.0548,4.1717,0.3496,5.4568,3.7503,3.7432,3.0075,0.4451,5.9183,4.3403,4.2235,4.039,0.5825,0.2775,1.19,0.3,0.0321,0.8665,3.801,5.6769,2.2766,1.363,1.7443,4.1276,0.5417,0.751,0.4229,0.9036,0.0002,2.8865,0.4602,1.1164,3.3204,2.3771,0.0595,1.57,4.616,0.6392,3.8966,3.9548,0.7107,3.5032,3.8572,2.8528,3.8681,0.0496,0.5854,4.082,0.037,0.8299,1.3418,1.6433,3.9859,1.6084,4.2432,1.4626,3.8101,0.0869,0.4424,0.0002,0.1583,1.899,0.4824,3.7437,0.0556,0.6163,2.0863,3.1176,1.246,0.853,2.9944,0.0186,0.0079,2.7083,0.0004,0.5849,0.2513,0.8245,0.0091,0.0122,0.6765,2.9935,2.676,1.4882,3.0069,3.2612,1.1447,3.9665,1.4331,3.6018,1.3804,3.7604,3.5574,4.3074,0.013,1.2556,0.8149,3.2161,0.5776,1.0142,1.1203,4.225,0.0665,4.0528,0.3856,5.8258,1.8404,0.9312,1.7714,5.1161,2.6148,1.9865,0.2896,0.4296,3.7348,0.4923,5.2523,5.3022,1.2788,3.3133,1.8043,1.1446,0.8054,1.3335,0.9737,0.7546,3.3397,0.0442,0.1769,1.8245,5.8537,0.5255,3.6817,1.2672,1.0843,0.437,2.4959,1.6522,2.8096,0.0953,3.1249,0.5912,2.1831,1.8435,5.168,0.1072,0.3912,1.5927,3.1868,0.3486,0.6515,4.6485,0.2153,0.4986,0.0003,3.6142,6.1054,2.0138,2.8791,0.5476,2.7475,4.0949,0.0629,3.4476,0.0103,0.6887,2.807,0.2261,4.5018,0.3339,0.4359,2.0507,0.9218,6.0743,1.802,3.083,4.4198,0.0049,1.5015,0.8396,0.1214,2.2682,0.5408,1.298,6.0974,4.4845,1.1462,4.6822,3.1842,2.2451,0.3888,3.307,5.4186,2.7251,0.5377,0.9188,1.5062,0.3369,3.8178,2.4546,3.4309,4.5247,1.1538,0.0015,0.2128,4.6666,5

{"id":3145,"ended":false,"length":702,"gen_text":"Your bully for 2 years comes up to you after school and punches you in the stomach, You've had enough and punch back, Your punch knocks him out cold. Everyone witnesses in shock. You never go to the police for this since it was on school property.\n\nThe fact is if bullies make up things about you, and you want to keep them to yourself they can.\n\nThis could happen to anyone with that attitude, even if you are of age, so just learn to handle it before it gets escalated, and you will never have to deal with a situation like this ever again.\n\nDon't let him have the upper hand with you, or your own body language!\n\nHe will never know how good looking you are!\n\nDon't let the fact that you don't want your boyfriends friends know what a monster he is! Because they will do everything they can to show him he's an easy target!\n\nThis goes for any bullying and teasing you can get. As soon as there is someone getting bullied and teased,\n\nDON'T KEEP IT TO YOURSELF!! This may sound crazy but I know it's true. A person's entire life revolves around one person, so if they can't handle it when it happens to someone else, they probably can't handle it themselves. When your loved one comes back (or wants to come back) talk to them, encourage them. Talk with them. Tell them what you are dealing with, what you are seeing and what they are doing to let you know. This will always give YOU the upper hand over the bully, AND it will always get them to act! Be firm when you speak to them if necessary, but be soft when teasing them. If they behave, and their friends tell them I won't hold back my opinions, they will act in the same ways. Don't allow your friends to get sucked in to being bullies.\n\nIf this happens at school, talk to the administrators about it!\n\nDon't just let it slide if it happens with kids you are close with. This will lead to more people bullying people.\n\nIf you get pushed or punched in the stomach, call the police the next day!\n\nThey have been trained to treat this as a serious assault, you can not be charged for something you didn't do. If he goes further and threatens your life for talking to the police, then make the cops aware of it. They can arrest him if you don't take him to the police station!\n\nIf it's a school bullying issue, make it known this to the school, they will usually address it. If it's your friends doing it, and you don't see what he is doing, don't talk to them about this. Let all of these people know they are not doing what they thought they were doing!\n\n\nIt's not going away\n\nIt's easy to fall into a trap with the media, with friends, and even with adults in a way.\n\nAll the time you hear something, no matter how outlandish.\n\nThis is because adults will think no matter how bad it is, it could be worse. Or maybe just worse if you didn't say anything.\n\nIt's been my experience that when you put your foot down and voice your concern, it gets blown to hell.

{"id":1949,"ended":true,"length":692,"gen_text":"A murderer plans their murders so that a seemingly strong case can be brought against them, a case which they can then disprove with the tiniest of details.\n\nA criminal that has been exposed to the public, who can prove to be innocent because of the facts mentioned in the articles.\n\nA criminal who, despite the odds being insurmountable, can prove their innocence due to those facts mentioned in the article. [1]\n\nA criminal who is discovered to be a killer and is subsequently convicted of killing another person. This can happen for several reasons: the victims are friends or have a common denominator with the criminal; the victim doesn't call the cops immediately because they were afraid of reprisal; the victim was involved or the victim's family found out or the victim had no family and found out after the fact while they were away in Hawaii; the victim was in an accident and died. There are also times that a criminal commits a homicide and then they change their minds and claim innocence.\n\nA criminal who is known to have some form of criminal record.\n\nA police officer or law enforcement officer who is found to have committed some type of wrongdoing.\n\nAnother person who claims to be wrongly convicted of a crime. (There are a ton of false claims out there. When your loved one comes back (or is alive and well) talk to them.)\n\nA person who has been falsely convicted by a lawyer. (Falsely convicted by a lawyer may be a felony in itself. They could be jailed as they had no lawyer.)\n\nA person who has been wrongfully imprisoned due to faulty evidence, ineffective defense, or other issues.\n\nA person who has gone to jail and you're still looking for them. I should note that there are exceptions to the above rules.\n\nA police officer who has recently retired or is on disability may be allowed to attend a conference if you make them part of the group beforehand. They can ask you during the conference about where and when they can attend the conference, and may even ask if you know of people who would be willing to help them get through the conference.\n\nThere's absolutely something for everyone at the conference, especially if you make sure to bring food.\n\nWhen you're done shopping and get back to your hotel, try and meet one of the speakers so you can talk with him\/her about your experience. You may not ever speak to your loved one again -- it's up to you what happens to you after this, but speaking to someone who has experienced it first-hand can be an eye-opening experience.\n\nYou can always contact me after the conference if there's any other tips or advice you need.\n\nYou can find all of the information you'll need to prepare for the conference on my website.\n\nYou don't NEED to be registered for the conference, but you are welcome to ask to join. I will be checking this group and if you are asked to be added you can be sure by asking.\n\nI hope you can make it to the conference. It's sure to be an unforgettable experience for everyone! Thanks in advance for reading. ~Sue\n\n\n[1] The \"fact of the matter\" is that if you were present and you saw your loved one being harassed -- harassed because the cops don't believe them -- and when you tried to leave the harassment was continuing, I am quite certain that the police would accuse you of being the harasser. In such a case, it could be very difficult for them to prosecute you on something that can be disproved with just a small detail.","token_len":743,"entropy":[10.7355,9.6331,4.8116,3.0287,4.3559,1.3029,4.3733,7.8712,7.8682,7.122,0.8921,0.1359,4.8709,0.2256,0.6604,1.8033,4.2442,5.1946,1.5899,2.294,1.7493,1.0469,8.9254,0.0036,2.5187,1.5576,8.2467,0.4927,0.0001,1.1736,2.059,0.5439,1.9029,0.0189,2.873,5.0552,5.1219,2.3158,1.6791,5.3218,1.5211,1.6233,1.9408,2.5767,3.3186,3.4247,3.5357,3.0211,1.2983,1.6865,4.628,0.8324,1.5576,4.508,6.0114,0.6861,0.59,4.2591,1.0791,0.4374,0.0001,0.831,2.6002,1.2653,4.4243,2.7577,2.1169,5.1379,2.5579,6.7021,0.0004,0.0047,0.2181,2.5084,1.9097,1.3027,0.0377,3.7068,0.0071,6.2034,1.6854,1.3957,0.2647,0.1397,1.8118,0.1881,7.628,0.8307,0.0383,0.1995,0.0002,0.5027,1.0518,0.5759,1.7678,5.7083,0.4118,0.4777,2.1619,4.419,2.5387,1.6773,2.9191,3.1314,1.6653,4.0959,3.1684,0.5042,0.7516,2.7732,2.8169,1.699,3.1515,2.4981,0.0511,1.2808,2.8589,5.7764,1.6143,5.0978,1.4328,4.8335,1.7882,2.796,5.319,0.0028,2.837,0.1987,1.1063,1.5688,0.4115,1.4257,5.5866,0.0008,5.1073,0.3922,3.7074,2.6532,3.574,0.8884,2.4041,1.4911,0.6848,3.3884,0.6562,0.6471,0.5394,0.5408,2.1121,4.5578,4.564,4.8351,1.5309,2.3157,1.4699,4.6049,0.1083,4.5569,1.26,0.2417,3.2512,4.3538,3.7174,2.5426,5.702,0.1197,2.7367,0.5104,0.4321,6.0509,2.7932,0.2092,4.5184,4.226,6.1483,1.5818,0.4806,0.3786,1.0317,2.951,3.064,2.0313,1.267,2.9809,3.1295,4.8051,0.5241,1.6091,3.6581,2.0334,1.3659,2.2128,4.5725,0.6687,4.6074,1.6173,2.1559,4.4277,5.0984,0.0412,2.2351,0.9048,2.552,2.0994,0.989,1.1284,0.0002,0.715,1.1081,0.592,1.1465,5.0655,0.3588,1.5092,5.5263,2.8631,0.007,3.5984,0.5485,1.8215,1.291,0.0002,0.371,4.8342,0.3627,2.3407,3.5337,0.0889,1.064,0.7733,1.3705,3.8869,0.2491,0.5272,1.7607,2.9251,1.9141,0.0028,2.974,0.8749,0.5556,0.0002,5.8754,1.9725,0.6855,3.6504,0.5295,0.5823,6.9127,0.9445,0.8823,0.2745,0.1566,0.9886,5.0971,4.685,0.5474,2.3359,5.0058,0.0549,3.2862,1.3562,2.082,0.0067,2.7234,5.7718,5.3088,3.5708,0.1185,5.3695,2.8399,7.7197,1.4564,2.3778,4.5841,1.9954,0.3759,0.5714,6.2046,0.1286,0.3572,2.1414,0.2153,0.0002,0.7642,1.6162,0.3739,1.7468,1.0309,1.4448,1.7895,4.1364,1.2538,5.0141,1.1977,2.3424,3.8439,1.1609,0.1223,0.7037,0.3011,0.0618,4.0196,1.2654,1.3378,3.8914,2.1746,1.7647,1.6731,4.4092,2.9181,0.7682,3.7157,4.6972,4.1568,5.2822,1.4348,1.7874,1.869,0.1097,0.0002,0.5492,0.7807,0.2176,1.1271,0.5254,4.2214,0.0016,2.7855,2.8942,0.0042,4.5561,0.7917,1.9852,5.3162,1.7668,0.4892,0.7756,2.3112,2.6617,0.3577,0.445,0.0002,0.4582,0.5028,0.1888,0.8257,5.0343,1.0068,1.2927,2.4756,6.0477,3.2615,3.2526,2.2114,0.0291,0.4401,0.4672,7.0082,5.5029,1.6523,0.2876,2.6336,0.4167,3.4401,0.3402,1.7338,0.6642,2.6878,0.6736,2.4418,0.0002,1.7021,4.129,0.187,0.7581,1.4047,5.5634,2.1233,1.7576,1.7652,2.4034,3.1102,5.7728,1.1084,3.5291,0.1475,4.82,1.703,3.634,2.638,3.8806,4.9748,2.7729,5.0585,0.0123,0.5782,1.9249,4.681,0.241,2.9927,1.8914,3.9269,1.3357,7.0686,0.2282,0.3856,2.8146,4.5926,3.6121,0.3808,0.8851,1.0193,1.1452,1.8144,0.3825,2.209,1.141,4.9076,2.012,2.1827,2.0979,0.941,3.3077,1.3446,4.9709,0.6397,2.4287,0.6267,0.289,0.0097,3.0296,0.3311,2.4525,4.2938,0.5838,1.2721,0.4398,0.9243,0.0002,3.6805,3.1269,5.5858,7.0008,1.3865,0.1851,1.9275,1.409,1.1016,1.8536,4.609,0.5246,0.1241,6.3931,2.3623,0.9393,2.3274,4.3016,1.8599,1.817,0.0002,4.7766,1.2398,2.0391,2.1957,6.1507,1.7639,4.7606,1.877,0.2902,0.7314,0.9535,0.4433,4.6962,2.321,3.6275,5.1252,0.5686,0.2264,3.149,4.1634,0.6339,0.0904,2.8303,1.8025,2.8028,0.6854,0.002,1.6507,1.6595,2.383,0.6099,2.4623,1.8067,3.4204,5.1079,4.5853,0.5412,3.2476,0.8102,0.1,0.3447,7.8069,2.5509,0.7562,3.1424,0.0028,0.1507,3.2407,2.4335,1.4508,1.5663,1.4955,2.5757,2.233,0.323,5.8648,1.2534,1.0967,0.7352,0.8801,2.3575,3.2281,2.6267,0.4769,0.0018,0.8024,1.0643,3.2545,1.1183,0.1477,0.6414,0.1635,0.3966,0.4727,0.0002,3.477,1.0958,3.3032,2.8984,1.4627,4.0564,0.4037,0.0762,1.445,3.7782,0.9035,2.5048,2.5014,4.9428,1.0445,2.2769,0.3154,1.8242,0.6474,0.8335,0.0002,4.052,0.7252,1.5728,2.6474,0.8591,0.6934,1.2909,1.0313,2.4571,0.102,0.6362,2.4171,0.5436,0.7325,0.4874,1.6814,1.1948,1.0002,1.4112,0.8211,0.0002,3.6859,4.3676,0.0005,7.2636,0.3178,2.4883,5.5345,0.8781,0.3745,0.111,1.5881,0.3074,2.0185,3.8438,1.4169,0.2043,6.5987,3.3288,1.9731,2.0855,2.2918,2.0376,1.9007,4.3565,3.6098,4.9142,3.0859,3.2524,0.5171,2.2201,3.2099,0.2974,2.9526,3.2024,2.5394,1.4589,2.5873,0.4465,8.5395,2.5947,1.3651,0.5222,0.0002,2.3054,2.0846,1.019,1.9972,0.9616,0.1215,1.0622,0.425,0.1878,1.3217,2.7412,0.5749,4.2588,0.0747,0.0477,1.3048,2.8623,0.2057,2.91,1.3097,2.1658,6.1462,3.8795,0.0039,0.2713,1.6309,1.4681,5.4051,4.3678,1.6029,3.7502,0.0004,2.3077,0.0613,0.0139,3.0755,3.9517,5.4073,4.103,0.7936,0.0897,0.0731,1.1012,0.7165,2.5188,0.8515,3.3368,5.0813,2.7231,2.5612,2.2767,3.0543,0.223,0.017,2.8957,5.0342,6.0521,4.5405,3.1148,2.9895,4.2532,3.5445,0.0004,0.7601,1.2379,1.0616,1.9687,5.663,0.6934,2.4026,0.0609,5.9181,1.6988,3.7474,1.6489,2.012,0.5421,5.3625,3.5713,4.1879,0.7213,0.5903,2.4097,1.5297,0.3179,5.8922,0.2497,0.0662,1.7285,1.1594,1.5832,0.0232,0.7782,4.1964,3.9483,0.3142,1.2737,0.3075,2.4501,3

{"id":1646,"ended":false,"length":684,"gen_text":"While putting your favorite condiment on a sandwich, you accidentally make a magical occult symbol and summon a demon.\n\n: The first example is summoning a demon to steal money while sitting at a table in Hell. In this case, the demon should never be invited to dinner. The second example is not a demon eating a sandwich. In this case, the demon is eating a bag of pretzels and is actually the pizza man. The third and most common example of this is giving a dog a sandwich, but actually getting a demon to bite him. The dog will always scream, \"I'm not supposed to eat that; it's poison.\"\n\nFilm\n\nLiterature\n\nLive Action TV\n\nIn MST3K, they did this fairly consistently: One example was a pair of alien invaders trying to eat Mr. Spock's sandwich, but it somehow got inside of Spock and got sucked out through his stomach. It's never explained. They attempted another attempt to get a second sandwich by placing his hat outside of his body and then tried to eat it with a straw. That one works too.\n\nMusic\n\nThe band Mott the Hoople has a song (The Phantom) called \"Pizza Man\". The track starts with some footage of a pizza man (trying to eat a hot dog, of all things), and then we get the following lines: \"Pizza man, pizza man, where the pizza man go?\" Atop an otherwise decent song, as they had to include three parts of footage of the pizza man's attempts at food and he died in the middle.\n\nTabletop Games\n\nIn GURPS, Pizza Man was a demon in a group of \"Pizza Bandits\" that would attack humans and eat them. An example of this would be that if someone is eaten by an Imp, they often become a pizza man. A Pizza Man will eat anything that isn't alive, so anything that is alive will become one with the Pizza Man. And he won't let go. However, he'll have a short term, limited reaction to the eating: If they eat something the size of a person, the Pizza Man will explode in pleasure, possibly destroying the world.\n\nTheater\n\nIn The Phantom of the Opera, one of the first examples is for a hungry opera-goer, the Phantom's daughter, who tries to steal a sandwich out of the restaurant of a rich man she thinks is cheating. This leads to the Phantom chasing down a man for this sandwich, and that's when it gets out... though it's not that big of a stretch to say that the Phantom didn't even see the sandwich before eating it.\n\nIn the musical The Phantom of the Opera, the Phantom's daughter steals a loaf of bread off a waiter; after she steals it, she throws the bread onto a busy street; a mob of shoplifters start to approach her; one of them starts to approach the Phantom, but he turns around, grabs his pocket, and starts to eat the bread with his fingers. The Phantom: Oh, I thought you'd never notice. The waiter's mouth is not even open!\n\n\nVideo Games\n\nWeb Comics\n\nWeb Original\n\nWestern Animation\n\nAdventure Time The title character has a habit of eating things that aren't even in the room! The most hilarious example happens when Waffle is on a job for Finn to find Finn's stolen lunch. He finds the sandwich that Finn ordered but not where he got it from. Finn then throws the sandwich on the ground just in time for Waffle to pick it up.\n\n\nReal

How does the day go?\n\nIs it alright in the way to kill or steal?\n\nWhat about sex? Are you going to talk with your spouse? If you want to keep the baby, are you going to tell your spouse? What is the difference between sex and murder? Who or what should you tell and when?\n\nI am a woman and I have never had relations with a human being. Am I allowed to lie?\n\nCan you have relations with your sister? What about your mother?\n\nDo you have a right to have relationships? Do you have the right to be treated the way you treat yourself?\n\nI am a woman and I have been divorced twice. I am very happy with my love life. Do I have a right to live my life the way I want and never settle?\n\nWhat are the limits of freedom?\n\nWhat should be a right : to respect yourself?\n\nWhat should be a right : to not be abused?\n\nWhat should be a right : to be treated as a person?\n\nDo you have your own language or own thoughts?\n\nWhat are the values of religion and values of life which will decide who will have the right to talk with you, who will be allowed to look at you or what you are wearing, where you live, where you work, how you will earn your living.\n\nIn what situation do others have a right : to help or to harm you? Do we have rights in our own rights?\n\nLet's have a look at the list of 10 questions you have to answer in order for you to find your right.\n\nThere are hundreds of questions to which people agree. Why didn't Socrates answer these questions in any case.\n\nIf we read the Greek texts carefully we will read that these questions weren't asked out of pure curiosity and curiosity to see which questions philosophers are going to answer, but because they will tell us things we have to know, help us to develop our own self and so on.\n\nYou can find several definitions and several replies to these questions by different philosophers in Aristotle's \"Politicon\", the \"Metaphysics\" of Democritus and the \"Ethics\" of Epicurus.\n\nPhilosophers will answer these questions to gain insight into our society and our relationship to it. A proper philosophical conversation should, first of all, ask a question to learn about someone's personality, beliefs and so on.\n\nThen they will answer that person's question so that you, the listener, can have experience and learn more about someone's character, beliefs and so on.\n\nIt also shows the knowledge of your listeners, your knowledge of their own beliefs and your own knowledge of their own opinions.\n\nIn the same way, you can use these same questions to gain insight into our society. You should also consider asking questions to gain knowledge about yourself.\n\nHow should we live?\n\nWhich of these five freedoms do you value most in our society today? Which of these is most important in your life right now?\n\nWhich is the last thing that you would give up in a philosophical conversation?

{"id":2239,"ended":true,"length":664,"gen_text":"The Pet Merchant\n\nNatalie Bercow is to blame for everything. The deputy Speaker, who represents London's affluent Kensington and Chelsea constituency, was recorded on video saying that the UK's poor quality public housing is a result of people like herself.\n\n\"I do not think it is good enough for the taxpayer to have to pay for people coming in and paying for us to have poor quality housing. I actually think it is wrong, that is my personal view,\" she told the BBC in an interview this week.\n\nWhen I asked for evidence for her claim that our poorest households pay twice as much in housing tax as the rich, I asked what she did for a living. She replied that she has her own property business but her constituency job pays for it, hence the tax she pays.\n\nIf Bercow, who receives an annual parliamentary salary of \u00a367,766, could afford to buy her own house, she could probably afford the \u00a3500 a month property tax on it. It's not something a million pound salary can easily afford.\n\nTo illustrate her point further, I looked up the average property tax payments for various boroughs: The average for London's Tower Hamlets district is \u00a31,919 while Kensington & Chelsea borough gives \u00a31,749.\n\nEven on a lower income, families on middle incomes do pay a lot of tax. As the New Institute for Public Policy Research shows, almost two out of three taxpayers earn more than \u00a350,000, yet pay only 1% of their income in taxes.\n\nBercow makes her extraordinary remarks in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr in which she was asked about comments that have been made by Jeremy Corbyn in which he accused George Osborne of having a \"budget designed for the rich\".\n\nThe Tories' current plan, she said, is to \"break people's aspirations about their future prosperity by taking away the people who have been providing for your future, through public funding of schools and public housing.\"\n\nBercow did not mention that the UK's most expensive private school is in her constituency, St Mary Magdalene College. The private school has received nearly \u00a39m in subsidies since 2006 and has been built with \u00a324m in taxpayer's money.\n\nBercow is right about housing. She has a point about public housing, but as many readers would know, it is not a government-run enterprise.\n\nAs long ago as 2007, when I lived in a council house, I noted how our boroughs gave housing advice to us. We were told all residents should consider \"living rent-free\" or \"sheltering on your own\".\n\nBut we got no subsidies. Instead, we were told to \"consider a property with a rent-controlled tenancy\" or a property in a private landlord scheme.\n\nThis policy was very common in inner London, in areas of poverty and crime areas, for years. We are still paying off that cost decades later.\n\nIn fact, some private landlords offer tenants \"no upfront charges and no mortgage repayments for up to 27 months\".\n\nIn short, council tenants were left to fend for ourselves because the government refused to subsidise council housing. That policy, I am sorry to say, continues to this day.\n\nBercow's comments are typical of her political class, who have little interest in helping the poor but much interest in blaming everybody else.\n\nShe will never have to pay her tax on her own house \u2013 and as her constituents will never have to pay for it either by any means they might choose.","token_len":744,"entropy":[9.9669,9.9698,2.3422,0.0061,5.8334,4.7784,4.5549,5.6349,1.3034,3.1703,4.9051,4.4893,0.5767,5.2522,1.1265,2.4917,5.2113,0.7887,2.4501,1.1639,3.8843,3.1233,1.1833,2.6,3.406,0.0003,0.4737,0.0013,0.4088,0.1029,2.4198,5.1236,2.2003,1.541,3.2134,1.4186,2.0345,3.8671,1.5749,5.1249,6.0401,3.6239,2.5448,1.6675,1.9645,2.0509,0.0137,3.2863,1.9452,2.1071,2.3328,0.5353,0.0003,1.3399,1.4295,3.7227,1.3596,1.3201,1.4445,0.5541,3.4074,0.1049,0.4679,2.4629,2.2488,0.0533,3.3272,0.0428,2.3486,0.3379,1.5121,6.4508,1.8385,1.3112,5.5567,1.3527,6.7639,0.2762,1.0916,2.2885,0.1438,0.1135,2.2596,1.1809,5.9896,0.2383,0.7824,0.3938,3.138,2.0933,4.1334,0.8543,2.0111,2.2805,0.1527,0.7642,0.4655,2.4061,1.514,1.4794,1.6925,2.6488,0.157,4.1666,0.6701,0.0964,0.1872,0.0003,4.5195,4.4963,2.0081,3.2684,1.9917,1.8159,0.7291,1.3882,2.0075,5.1088,5.869,3.2342,1.74,5.1434,0.5137,0.0121,1.8748,0.7676,4.2179,0.2613,1.0897,1.9715,0.1856,2.1402,5.3503,5.525,1.4003,4.4087,1.0138,0.342,0.0127,0.2732,1.76,1.4574,1.5891,0.2672,4.1091,4.5684,0.2246,2.3175,2.107,4.5135,4.8333,4.5429,3.6944,3.5833,3.4343,3.0778,2.5814,5.6212,0.8901,2.6897,3.0097,0.5964,0.2379,0.3356,0.0003,4.5154,2.964,0.0001,0.0005,3.9281,0.8818,5.53,2.58,0.6861,3.7763,0.3421,0.0368,0.2219,1.1041,0.0084,3.1533,2.339,0.2213,3.99,1.0943,0.433,2.4759,0.8776,0.1085,1.4971,0.8282,0.8781,1.0537,2.5029,0.3371,2.9976,1.4752,4.2451,2.1801,0.6331,4.5107,0.3189,3.6463,0.8694,0.5171,3.829,1.1316,1.6171,5.418,3.6388,5.3854,0.8858,3.1527,1.1804,3.2805,0.4908,0.3779,0.3311,0.0003,5.329,4.0776,1.6895,0.2779,3.6491,0.0865,1.5918,2.7409,0.734,0.7415,1.1674,1.9918,0.1748,3.7398,1.534,4.9355,3.464,0.0109,5.7753,5.2406,0.6364,2.7319,2.1041,3.5161,4.7957,0.0005,0.0001,4.3003,0.8959,0.1507,1.7845,0.0169,3.5039,3.8527,4.501,2.171,0.0025,3.1591,0.0003,4.0384,5.8824,1.1826,0.486,0.0031,3.1526,3.2914,0.4497,0.9713,0.0003,4.6507,4.4936,2.0076,3.8277,0.945,0.2716,6.1724,1.8188,3.4211,0.669,4.9036,0.6274,2.3898,1.5079,0.7015,1.0042,0.8563,4.614,1.6394,5.6352,5.3952,0.4951,1.9856,0.0117,0.0432,3.7611,0.1984,5.4407,2.4421,3.7578,0.0038,0.5741,4.2481,4.933,2.3339,0.0144,0.0883,1.8635,0.0115,0.0143,2.8772,2.3522,1.5086,2.4906,4.6507,1.7166,0.172,0.387,0.3167,0.2848,2.5992,0.1752,0.6815,0.0003,2.8738,0.1182,0.0005,5.9967,1.7847,6.3441,2.6034,1.4486,1.8865,0.2426,0.3939,1.0291,0.5147,0.6831,1.0875,0.0635,0.0001,3.7326,0.3246,0.1011,3.2448,0.7395,0.948,4.2828,4.7501,4.3994,0.3509,0.1284,0.5601,3.824,0.0495,2.8466,1.9873,0.0877,4.1777,5.0636,0.0021,0.1,3.0862,1.3015,0.2686,5.036,3.4286,0.9166,0.8039,0.1537,0.2759,0.3026,0.0003,2.5937,4.3131,2.1386,4.8185,2.5111,2.2665,1.4963,0.7733,0.0449,0.9473,0.3575,1.2842,5.2068,4.1478,0.5885,2.5422,4.6835,2.755,1.5921,5.7582,3.4621,3.907,1.8044,1.3079,5.4467,2.2768,1.9229,2.0971,4.6247,1.8225,4.4464,2.084,3.1059,5.9478,3.4641,5.0314,0.8835,1.7429,0.8433,2.8638,2.3677,2.0217,0.1277,0.0002,2.3928,0.0151,0.0003,4.5797,0.1116,1.8501,1.109,1.5078,4.1036,1.0332,3.6539,1.9393,2.3599,0.6659,1.7535,1.2971,1.5406,0.9285,1.1221,2.5795,2.2301,1.2237,0.0001,0.5594,1.4527,1.6392,2.1371,4.7369,0.6423,2.7205,3.6845,3.4862,0.0445,4.1868,0.682,0.774,3.7279,1.5054,3.9196,2.5587,2.2673,2.116,5.7713,1.6207,2.2074,4.9434,0.1381,1.3329,2.5709,2.2244,0.181,0.2346,0.5235,0.0003,2.2379,0.0231,0.0004,2.4176,2.3699,2.2015,3.1708,1.1133,3.0171,2.3604,1.2526,1.2088,1.4054,2.3635,0.2376,1.6251,1.5203,4.9275,4.1409,3.5547,5.3008,0.9241,0.1824,2.4571,0.6819,1.118,2.4302,5.0552,2.3113,1.8122,4.5841,0.4191,1.6228,0.0002,3.895,4.7049,0.8389,0.0089,3.7743,0.2172,3.6167,1.8539,3.0768,0.1086,3.1012,1.0028,0.603,1.334,0.5571,4.2049,2.4482,4.6573,5.8928,2.8484,4.6891,3.6842,3.8815,0.5039,3.669,1.5987,2.4824,0.4341,0.706,6.7023,5.8986,0.8161,2.6211,3.0572,3.5429,4.731,0.5097,0.0104,0.8945,2.3462,0.7744,5.7678,1.0674,0.8277,4.2118,3.314,0.0494,1.0364,0.8296,0.0002,3.5093,2.8041,4.369,1.4016,3.8021,1.7884,3.3268,0.3033,0.7721,1.4318,1.6406,0.6877,2.1816,3.4877,3.2171,3.5901,2.3852,0.8687,3.8037,0.7994,0.9464,0.9055,1.4582,1.0039,3.3783,3.6613,3.1248,1.1869,3.9039,2.8976,3.0511,0.3769,0.7455,0.0002,3.7661,4.1429,1.6599,5.0186,3.6379,1.1928,5.3635,0.49,1.5439,4.3698,2.9869,3.5309,4.7254,1.4449,4.7907,7.4979,1.8336,4.4028,3.5654,0.3793,3.6033,4.3028,2.2245,0.7447,2.9663,2.9938,4.7413,5.7956,0.1633,0.1947,0.2469,0.0002,3.1948,2.4353,0.0552,4.7668,4.3349,0.2489,3.8278,2.507,2.4664,4.6537,2.4864,4.5736,2.384,0.6244,2.6225,2.0925,0.0005,2.7589,2.1293,0.0031,6.2347,1.2376,0.8165,1.3477,0.0002,3.0952,4.563,0.0266,5.4912,1.8178,2.749,4.7266,0.7647,1.4337,0.0063,4.1474,4.6679,1.4778,1.2312,3.1233,0.026,1.852,0.0153,2.9137,0.3968,0.3172,4.0647,1.6181,3.4066,4.574,3.163,1.9312,0.0037,0.047,0.0181,1.3536,0.9828,0.2868,0.0095,0.1841,0.1503,0.0002,1.902,0.0349,0.0004,1.1901,1.6124,1.5773,4.8145,0.0773,2.7861,3.0998,1.9611,2.022,0.9299,2.201,3.2007,1.7885,0.0206,1.7579,1.0504,0.7974,3.6585,4.0739,1.4515,0.0095,4.0983,6.4532,0.2519,0.9545,0.7141,0.0002,2.6708,4.6226,3.7166,2.5809,0.2953,1.2228,1.7859,2.7174,2.885,0.

{"id":3821,"ended":false,"length":710,"gen_text":"A young child and a serial killer, despite having never met, share a telepathic link, and in one short afternoon the child will kill him, and the killer will turn his own daughter into a mindless killer for his own lustful pleasure.\n\nAn interesting story about a couple who adopt a child into their family, and later become embroiled in a murder mystery.\n\nThe author is a very charming man and a wonderful story-teller. He does a lovely job of capturing the mood and the feelings of this very sad man. The story is so unique that it can be read multiple times and I think that I would like it even more if I knew a bit more about him, which I may do as I am currently writing this post, and trying to gather another story to post about. One of my favourites!\n\n\"Beware, my friends, for your light is fading.\"\n\nThis is a very creepy and eerie story about the strange happenings at a small school during the second world war. Written beautifully by a talented author with excellent writing ability and a distinct feel for the situation, it just gets better and better.\n\nThis is a book about an entire family who moves overseas where they quickly discover the horrors of war. The author does a superb job with the way he uses language and the way he uses his characters. My favourites are the author's descriptions of the children who are slowly but surely being turned into vicious killers. They could be the youngest child in the world, but they look like they were killed many times before, and he does a nice job using language that captures the mood, and tone. The author is clearly a good listener and he makes sure this story is very well written. One of my favourites!\n\nI've written about I am a Killer before: this time I'm going to write about it a little separately. A young boy and a killer. I was going to include the author's profile at the end but when you are going through this, you shouldn't really feel like you're going through a biography, because not even the author has one.\n\nI am not completely sure of the author's credentials (although I did run across an author list of his novels), but my impression from his books is that he is clearly an old-time horror fan and has been playing with the genre for many years. This story features a young boy who is obsessed with death and killing, and the author certainly has it covered as he writes some of the creepiest stories ever to be published online.\n\nThis story is one of my favourites, because it is so haunting, creepy and sad. The author has a unique style that is a treat for all readers.\n\nSo, I have tried my utmost to include at least one of these stories in every post I write, and now I have concluded a list with the best, most creepy novellas and short stories for free in pdf form.\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading these, if you have questions don't hesitate to request a novella or short story from me (including its author's details), please be sure to provide me some feedback as I would also be grateful to know how you felt about the stories and novellas included in my list.\n\nYou can enjoy these horror stories regardless of whether you are a fan of the author's or not, and as always feel free to leave any questions or comments (which is also great!)

{"id":1130,"ended":false,"length":691,"gen_text":"It's been a month since you discovered that every time you wake up, you have a new body.\n\nIs it that your mind is changing or is it that the body changes to match your mind?\n\nIt would seem that there is some kind of mind-body connection.\n\nWould you be willing to try an experiment that is supposed to make you better or worse at certain things and see if any change is made in your behavior?\" he asked.\n\nMr. Tappis, a physics professor at New Mexico State University, said he knew from other scientists that the body and the mind could have a connection. For instance, he said, the mind would be able to change what a person eats or what a person wears.\n\nMany things could affect brain activity, Mr. Tappis said. But whether an experience can influence the change in your behavior is one of the most controversial aspects of mental medicine, and there has never been an experiment to show that it occurs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the Tappis experiment, which began in 1985, participants spent some 20 minutes having a visual and acoustic experience through headphones. Then they answered questions about how they felt, where they might live and various questions about their jobs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The images were often of people's close friends, family members, romantic partners, their best friends or relatives. The people in the pictures were randomly selected.\n\nAfter the experiment, they were examined for changes in the physical structure of their hippocampi, small parts of the brain that are known to play an important role in learning. The changes included changes in one type of brain cells that had grown and moved in response to the auditory experience.\n\nThe test of emotional reaction showed that the more sensitive people became to the emotional pictures, the smaller, fewer and less well-organized new brain regions developed in the hippocampus.\n\nMr. Tappis said they found that those who were most emotional about the pictures gave smaller test responses \u2014 the faster the more sensitive they were. Other findings showed that the less sensitive participants who also had the large hippocampi were less likely to give smaller \"emotional\" test responses.\n\n\"I did ask how the brain would react to the new hippocampal architecture in a way that would correlate with the emotional effects of the experience,\" Mr. Tappis said in an interview. \"That idea was that the brain would learn to respond to that experience as if the brain wanted to experience the new hippocampal architecture. It would be like a new limb for the brain.\"\n\nHe said that it might not be necessary to be overly emotional when being a researcher interested in human perception or the mind.

{"id":2409,"ended":true,"length":644,"gen_text":"A new designer drug makes people brilliant for five minutes... 100 words later\n\nIt was only a year ago that scientists first put the word \"insane\" in the same sentence as the powerful psychedelic drug LSD.\n\nNow, a new study has confirmed that a chemical called ketamine can provide those same benefits within minutes.\n\nThe results are sure to reignite the debate about using drugs like ketamine to treat depression.\n\nThe findings, published today in the journal Nature Neuroscience, provide the first evidence that ketamine can quickly reverse depression in humans.\n\nImage copyright SPL Image caption In research published in April, scientists discovered Ketamine worked twice as well as an antidepressant prescription\n\nDepressed people with a history of addiction can be given drugs like Prozac, which work by lowering the levels of serotonin.\n\nThis effect is what makes the mood-altering drug so successful, but there's a problem - the drug's side-effects can mean that users are often unwilling to use it.\n\nSo researchers have been working to identify other drugs that might work on a more short-term basis.\n\nAnd in April, a team from Emory University in the US developed one - ketamine - which, when injected into rodents, provided the same antidepressant effect as a standard antidepressant. At the same time, the drug was much safer than antidepressants.\n\n\"The findings are so surprising that we wanted to put them into the public domain, and we decided that it was important to get ketamine out into the clinic,\" said lead researcher Aaron Krupitsky.\n\nBut as exciting as that finding may be for patients seeking access to this drug, scientists still know far less about how the brain works in depression.\n\nThis makes ketamine a \"first-in-class antidepressant\" that may prove far more useful than those available now - which will work for about two hours after being injected into the brain, and only when used in very high doses, Krupitsky explained.\n\nIn the short term, it may replace other antidepressants at a quicker rate Aaron Krupitsky, University of Georgia\n\nHe added: \"In the short term, ketamine is a first-in-class antidepressant that may prove far more useful than those available now. We hope that our study on the ketamine will spur the development of more rapid-acting antidepressants over the next several years.\"\n\nKendal, an American company that produces Ketamine, says this study does not affect its long-term intentions for the drug.\n\nImage copyright Ketamine Image caption Ketamine is often injected for depression relief\n\nDr Mike Daynes, executive director of Neuroscience Research UK, said: \"Ketamine is a promising drug and it is likely this study will be replicated in mice within the next few months.\n\n\"It could provide an effective long-acting treatment for depression in humans.\n\n\"But it is important to stress that more research needs to be done to establish whether the drugs work for people suffering from mild to moderate levels of depression as well as severe cases - and most importantly, what effects these drugs have on the brain and how they affect patients.\"\n\nDr Krupitsky added: \"Our study shows that when ketamine is used alone, within 20 minutes people are able to recover from depression symptoms.\n\n\"In addition, the drug causes only mild side-effects such as sedation and tingling - so with only these mild side-effects, patients do not need anything else to treat their depression.\" He hopes his findings will help doctors formulate a better treatment for depressed people.\n\nFollow James on

Write about a relationship that should never have happened.\n\n. Make me cry. Write about your feelings but you can't handle them right now.\n\nYou could also use these tips when writing essays.\n\nIt is a very good idea to write about your feelings and then give them to a friend or your blog or something else so that you have the opportunity to discuss your feelings with a professional.\n\nWhen I was a first year Medical student, our professor gave us the assignment of writing an essay or reading a book on a topic that we'd like to study in the upcoming school year. One of my classes had an objective to study the use of the diuretic and the other class was to study the effect of an antihypertensive medication taken during pregnancy on the fetus.\n\nAt the beginning of the class, I couldn't help telling my classmates that I had no interest in researching on a topic that had no correlation to the class objective. But then my instructor made a comment about why the diuretic was used in pregnancy: The fetus will urinate in order to make enough sodium to ensure the survival of their brains, which are the main brain cells that develop.\n\nEven though there is no correlation between the two goals mentioned in class that day as they had never thought about that before, I felt this to be extremely logical and a logical explanation of why the diuretic would be used during pregnancy.\n\nIt is said that you don't need to tell the audience everything that you know. One of the most important parts of a good story is not to tell everything. It is important to give the audience something to connect with you. People will talk about the most superficial things, but if it is meaningful, it could be something that could even make them feel better.\n\nYou know what people tend to talk about when they want to connect with someone? Food. And food has something the internet can't explain: it is a form of exchange. So what do people value more, food or friends? The answer is friends. If you ask one of your family members what they value more, they'll always say food. You will not likely find someone who will say friend.\n\nYou might not like writing essays about writing. This is actually something I would say is a good thing. Writing itself is not anything to be ashamed about if it is something that you are really happy about.\n\nYou might not like writing essays about writing. This is actually something I would say is a good thing. Writing itself is not anything to be ashamed about if it is something that you are really happy about. Writing is something to do, and the best way to do it is writing essays.\n\nOne last point to keep in the thoughts of all the editors and writers out there: remember that there is also room for creativity in writing. Some writers are better (better at writing as I think) at writing an essay than some writers are at writing a script.\n\nThere are always many opinions shared and different things being expressed through the internet to help people express themselves. Do not be afraid of sharing your thoughts. When you share your thoughts, use your own words or the words of other people to express your thoughts. This will ensure that you will have some input into writing another essay.\n\nHave you ever thought of writing an essay or just sharing your thoughts on the internet?

Would you be happy with your investment of $1,100 and the inconvenience of having to call tech support during the replacement period if you have a problem with the device in any way?\n\nIf you're not satisfied with a product, how can you get it fixed?\n\nIn the most recent Consumer Reports report, the company's data reveal that some issues with Apple's most recent phones are due to users simply not understanding the issue. This is why we suggest users take care of their phones from the very start, especially if the issue is a security flaw or an otherwise annoying problem.In case any of your Apple issues are due to a problem with your Touch ID sensor, please contact AppleCare for tech support. If necessary, you may also find the service helpful if your issue isn't related to Touch ID, but arises due to the iPhone's other shortcomings.The issue we've written about here isn't a new one, according to Consumer Reports. The site has been closely following the issues with the new iPhone 4 over the last two months, after receiving a number complaints from its readers. Consumer Reports says that some users complained about problems using Touch ID, while others said that they didn't want to spend the $1,100 to get their devices fixed.Of the six major issues with the new iPhone 4S that were discovered by Consumer Reports, the one that we were able to point out is one of the simplest to solve: Touch ID. Apple's new fingerprint scanner is one of the latest features in the latest versions of the iPhone 4S. As a result, Touch ID, which is usually found near the new iPad's Home button, is now located on the left side of the display. The scanner works by providing a secure code that, when presented with certain commands, makes the phone open to a special menu.As can be seen above, the problem that Consumer Reports discovered involves users mistakenly swiping their thumb across the Touch ID reader, rather than simply touching the Home button with the same, new finger that's used for touching the Home button in new iPhone generations in the past. This, in turn, causes the iPhone to unlock itself automatically.In order to solve this issue, Consumer Reports suggests that users follow the instructions included with their Apple Care insurance coverage to restore their iPhone to factory settings. After doing so, the user will need to enter a password in order to gain access to the new Touch ID scanner.After following the instructions given by AppleCare, the user is given the option to upgrade their Touch ID security features via the Touch ID settings (which is similar to the old Touch ID security setting). The update will make access to Touch ID much more convenient by adding a menu to the display that will let the user enter a password in order to gain access to their phones with Touch ID.","token_len":748,"entropy":[0.1814,2.1974,4.3286,4.3767,2.3118,7.1355,0.1867,5.3916,6.424,2.6271,5.8521,0.9298,2.4764,4.6382,0.8144,8.086,10.1036,0.8472,1.9932,0.0015,5.6641,0.952,4.4511,3.4983,2.0396,1.1553,5.057,0.9977,1.2081,1.997,0.1042,2.2245,0.2091,0.6172,0.0002,3.1557,0.2184,1.0892,5.3246,3.49,2.7988,2.4355,0.5452,0.2083,0.3732,0.5909,3.3739,0.3655,0.0332,2.6064,1.5178,1.1966,0.0093,1.4043,5.8576,1.1576,0.2753,0.5765,2.7398,6.2789,1.8366,0.6062,0.0953,1.564,0.7569,3.2142,7.625,0.1375,0.4387,0.5771,0.0002,2.9027,0.0715,1.0262,5.608,0.9523,1.5924,3.0249,2.2564,0.725,0.8723,0.3277,0.509,0.338,0.2455,0.5835,0.1395,0.0086,0.0996,0.0536,0.0117,0.0016,0.1481,0.015,0.0055,0.0124,0.0036,0.0091,0.0143,0.0038,0.0025,0.0018,0.0048,0.0005,0.0069,0.0022,0.0006,0.008,5.0713,3.9952,0.1344,1.8901,0.5762,4.747,4.76,3.5363,2.07,0.2077,1.8501,1.814,1.0311,1.2192,0.4278,0.9812,3.6923,1.3744,6.189,1.8648,0.9338,0.756,0.0486,0.0731,4.2391,1.3352,1.0028,3.6916,6.2456,0.4312,1.2233,4.4725,2.9188,4.4404,2.3775,4.9254,1.5401,4.5603,0.3581,0.4206,0.0002,0.7125,0.0027,0.0252,0.002,0.0014,0.0011,0.0009,0.0006,0.0011,0.0015,0.0101,0.0113,0.0018,0.0007,0.0004,0.0011,0.0017,0.0009,0.0005,0.0007,0.0004,0.0003,0.0006,0.0044,0.001,0.0009,0.0005,0.0006,0.0006,0.0004,0.0012,6.1918,0.1346,2.0132,3.6737,1.4082,1.4747,6.1933,3.306,1.5839,2.494,0.057,4.2046,3.8958,3.1348,3.4035,0.2621,1.4486,0.328,4.8378,5.9946,0.0104,5.4516,0.9131,3.9747,2.5813,3.5088,1.3785,3.3242,1.1277,1.4478,1.3487,1.9044,1.7475,5.4291,4.1618,0.0407,0.0482,0.2143,0.0002,1.9482,0.145,0.9929,2.6571,3.7905,0.1954,3.6517,2.5556,1.3747,3.2436,1.4347,0.0946,2.2992,1.1226,0.9802,0.3437,0.4436,0.0002,4.3813,1.3645,5.8211,2.3514,4.9104,0.1194,3.5726,0.6641,2.1115,2.8521,2.7167,5.1232,6.1024,0.3166,5.0095,4.499,1.0686,2.0292,0.9997,6.3143,0.2944,2.6363,1.3867,2.2292,0.0389,3.645,3.831,1.114,1.9149,1.228,3.6636,0.7857,3.9538,1.2699,2.7705,2.6241,3.3584,3.9038,2.1565,4.8778,0.4269,0.9368,1.1572,3.8489,0.4213,1.9336,1.643,1.9813,3.2045,0.6152,2.9549,1.4408,0.8732,2.2093,3.3707,3.1798,1.8551,2.8949,5.4246,3.3254,2.15,0.2815,5.6843,4.2691,4.8878,0.2382,3.0886,2.5432,3.2092,1.0064,2.483,0.0082,0.8888,3.1622,0.1136,0.7974,3.9848,0.0476,2.0217,0.31,3.9956,1.9239,0.1968,1.7325,2.0763,6.7871,0.0993,0.7516,2.5076,5.9571,0.0246,1.2956,1.8767,0.5755,4.5886,2.0203,5.0099,2.5916,1.5627,1.6337,2.6998,4.0071,0.0003,2.5082,0.0284,0.7547,0.0183,2.5307,1.1048,5.6158,2.1399,0.0035,2.5919,4.0553,0.5892,3.163,4.8985,0.2585,3.8527,3.7828,4.2108,2.3298,4.7043,0.0348,1.4925,3.0689,0.0002,1.9715,1.6277,0.5713,1.1157,5.569,0.0041,2.8738,0.0092,0.7302,1.8554,4.704,2.0444,1.3448,5.4695,1.135,0.7553,3.6609,1.4334,1.702,3.036,1.2465,1.3322,8.6775,0.0397,1.4138,2.8451,0.7901,0.9467,5.1435,2.9724,1.9027,0.7631,6.4551,0.6266,2.3678,0.2255,0.4345,3.4253,0.0292,2.4058,0.7734,2.9616,1.3036,4.6931,1.3646,2.7609,4.1414,1.576,0.0143,1.5434,1.6188,0.1246,2.0192,1.3178,2.2412,3.0561,0.0003,2.8571,0.3487,3.8437,1.3976,1.6414,0.7819,0.0025,0.3608,1.3038,1.6339,2.7667,3.0127,0.4998,0.4644,4.9843,1.1664,4.7895,3.6718,1.0552,3.3439,0.2793,1.1637,0.4249,0.1413,1.7249,2.4016,3.2767,3.8963,0.5466,0.1566,0.0045,0.3013,2.0764,3.971,0.592,3.6479,4.8233,2.3112,0.0036,5.8979,0.5772,2.4232,2.495,1.3977,0.1055,3.9434,1.3492,2.6104,1.5599,3.0094,0.0101,1.3328,3.8856,1.2084,1.1734,1.1128,1.6655,1.484,2.9419,0.0223,0.1179,5.9595,2.3253,1.9988,0.3085,2.0196,4.5944,0.0032,1.4156,0.2877,1.2371,0.4955,1.1863,3.7461,2.5509,0.4754,0.2198,5.7637,0.0031,4.4057,0.87,1.4528,5.4869,4.0284,4.2244,0.0441,7.5494,6.3789,0.3,1.5642,0.1094,0.1997,0.8567,0.8034,1.5958,0.8643,0.0503,3.864,0.1489,0.0768,0.0213,5.509,0.7988,2.8243,2.7003,2.727,1.3601,5.5576,0.8209,2.8975,5.2764,1.0747,4.4572,0.455,4.2543,1.8682,3.5849,5.3401,0.2792,4.892,0.7362,0.8455,2.8763,3.3289,1.7989,3.263,1.0617,1.1029,4.8339,5.9374,0.0185,0.1645,3.4229,0.045,1.1645,2.3136,3.4676,2.4253,0.0158,2.7923,3.1355,2.3275,3.757,5.026,0.0005,0.7454,2.0951,1.5357,0.223,1.2055,0.0041,4.0769,2.4464,2.1199,0.0038,2.7308,3.3654,0.463,2.5659,0.0471,2.9602,1.5703,3.5346,4.3889,4.4893,2.259,2.2298,2.0611,1.8139,1.5797,5.5391,0.491,0.7859,0.014,3.2371,7.4549,1.7148,3.6382,6.119,0.383,0.0606,0.0511,2.5247,3.1478,0.7527,0.0563,0.0074,1.2156,0.3505,1.6274,0.6131,3.6147,2.3314,3.3453,1.1007,3.121,2.0122,0.0928,2.1015,0.8368,0.7598,0.1204,2.8778,0.0174,1.0483,1.2483,0.3899,4.7052,1.5522,2.5976,4.6108,0.9181,1.3162,2.7145,3.0034,5.1999,2.8443,2.0734,4.8967,0.6543,1.0142,0.819,0.7911,0.2999,0.7659,2.7325,1.5501,0.2531,0.0114,1.5682,2.1165,2.2918,1.331,0.0117,1.6252,1.4721,2.4386,2.58,0.0335,0.0508,3.0125,0.1152,0.0341,0.6279,3.3088,0.8432,0.007,2.2368,0.4715,3.2908,4.2115,0.8482,0.7863,4.5247,0.5744,0.4041,1.1211,0.4047,0.9136,0.5256,3.201,4.0957,0.8216,0.2826,0.2163,5.0694,1.3795,1.9926,0.0067,4.113,2.7373,5.0096,1.1184,3.7328,0.0334,0.9282,6.1051,2.4367,1.6052,5.9188,0.0263,1.0566,4.8513,0.8287,0.0175,2.0823,2.9207,1.4046,2.5555,4.931,1.318,3.4914,7.4674,0.0701,0.6472,0.0058,2.941,0.5935,3.005,3.5778,2.338

That's the beginning of this story.\n\n\"It was in the year 2210, on the 6th of January, around 7 PM.\n\nI did feel sorry for those people.\n\nThey weren't doing it for love of the Lord.\n\nThey did it for greed!\n\nThey were so sure they could make more money.\n\nThey were so sure they were better than you.\n\nThey were so sure they could out do you.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nI had done every thing in my power to help them.\n\nI had sent them our money, our knowledge,\n\nthe very best of our people.\n\nThen, after trying to help them for so long,\n\nI had the idea to send them a copy of this article.\n\nOf course, what they wanted was to get to our planet.\n\nBut what I offered them, so much more valuable,\n\nis that they might live!\n\nIt wasn't really a good deal for them,\n\nbut they had no choice.\n\nAnd from that day on, they would never be enslaved.\n\nThey could have all the technology,\n\nall the wealth,\n\nall the opportunities,\n\nthat their brains so clearly could see.\n\nThey had always heard those words;\n\n\"Life begins at conception.\"\n\nAnd that's as clear to them now\n\nas it was to us.\n\nThe Bible and my article were their escape.\n\nBut it's just as true for the rest of us.\n\nThis article is for them, but it's also my escape.\n\nMy journey is a pilgrimage\n\nthrough the gates of my heart, my soul.\n\nI'm here to make myself one with\n\nthis planet I live on.\n\nA passage from the book of Genesis\n\nreveals that God creates man\n\nin his own image.\n\nIn the story God, through his servant Adam,\n\nhas blessed me with two gifts.\n\n(What a great way to start my day!)\n\nThe first gift is knowledge.\n\nThis second gift is the ability to create\n\nthis earth for my people, my brothers and sisters,\n\nand to make their lives better.\n\nGod knows we are not here for us to waste.\n\nGod knows that we are not here to live this life to itself.\n\nIf we are here to create this earth that we have been given\n\nfor our own pleasure, for our own selfish reasons,\n\nthen we should all die.\n\nSo, I invite you to turn your attention\n\naway from your iPhones\n\nand your laptops,\n\nand look to the people around you.\n\nLook to those people who are trying to do what they love.\n\nLook to those people who have hope.\n\nLook to those people who are looking for a better life. We are grateful (you can thank me later),\n\nand we are eager to see you!

{"id":1786,"ended":false,"length":693,"gen_text":"Mundane Monday : It was a perfect fall day... I couldn't believe the way the sky looked, especially the day after a big storm.\n\nMundane Tuesday : I knew we had to keep the baby in our home, as she was a baby once and she didn't want to be outside right now.\n\nMundane Wednesday : It didn't matter how much we tried, she still refused to eat and didn't nurse. So we made another attempt, this time we found a new babysitter, and this one seemed to be better; we would wait outside for her, she would go to a window, the babysitter would go to work, we'd come back and she would drink a bottle of water.\n\nMundane Thursday : The baby was still not acting like herself; we were taking it a little easy, we weren't pushing her to go outside. We also had taken her to a new doctor's appointment.\n\nMundane Friday : We couldn't wait any longer, and when she was out for the third time that day, we found her hanging from the bottom of our baby swing. I rushed outside, where I saw her lifeless body lying right by the swing. The rest of the people in our neighborhood were looking in our direction... \"Baby, go outside and drink from the water!\" we yelled. The babysitter was in tears... \"I'm so sorry mommy, you just can't help it, you drink too much water and she died.\" It was very upsetting, she was my coworker and was the sole reason I was working. When I went home, I cried for an hour and then slept the rest of the day.\n\nMundane Saturday : The funeral is around the corner, I feel like it won't be that long until I am able to go again; she was only 8 days old and we had planned to take her to the cemetery this afternoon.\n\nMundane Sunday : I think I want to go to the cemetery on Monday night.\n\nMundane Monday : My boss and I will have to take turns driving the baby, you can't be working if you can't afford a babysitter. That is the first year that I will be taking care of a baby, now we will have to make sure I don't choke on baby grass tomorrow.\n\nMundane Tuesday : My boss is so mean, she has been yelling profanities at me... I mean, if it wasn't that bad, we wouldn't be having a bad day at work. She makes me take a two hour lunch break every day just to get by, I also have to take three ten-minute breaks daily just for \"cleaning the baby.\"\n\nMundane Wednesday : My boss said that I will no longer be allowed to take a lunch break, unless I take the lunch break when the baby is in school... because \"she gets bored.\"\n\nMundane Thursday : There won't be another ten-minute lunch break until we have some time off to go to the cemetery; she has started crying and asking to go to the cemetery by herself. I took her to the playground yesterday; she enjoyed walking around alone.\n\nMundane Friday: I finally talked to her as friends would, on her first day of school; we hugged while the other kids laughed. I even took her to the shopping cart area on my way back home.

{"id":2371,"ended":false,"length":701,"gen_text":"You are a dog... I want that in the newspaper,\" she said, looking at the front page of her local newspaper with a smile and a straight face.\n\n\"I want to be a dog, a cat, a cow, an ostrich. All these animal kinds are called 'dog.' I don't want to see any other animal\u2014I want to look at a dog,\" she told reporters.\n\nA dog?\n\nIn the past we have discussed the fact that many people who claim to be liberals and atheists are actually religious. Some are even hard to tell, with a belief system that's a blend of faith, love, and dogmatism, making them seem like a cross between George W. Bush and a Buddhist monk. In other cases people use atheism as some sort of cloak to hide what they really think, and there are many reasons why we assume religious people who have left the faith are actually religious, if not in good conscience, then at least in the face of religious bigotry. It's not something new.\n\nIn fact, it has been a perennial problem. From Christopher Hitchens (who was an atheist), to Daniel Dennett (who also was an atheist), to Michael Shermer (who is also an atheist), to Richard Dawkins (who is an author and activist) we have seen several Christian atheists who have claimed to leave their faith due to religious bigotry as they find it more difficult to reconcile Christianity with the reality of human nature. That is, they were atheists who found that it's hard to believe in a benevolent theocracy, and religion was just so hard to square with reality.\n\nNow there is a new trend in the atheist movement which appears to be changing how we think about these issues. The trend is that young people who grew up under the influence of the internet will not hesitate to declare that they're atheists. And if they can't even make it as atheists, they will certainly leave the faith.\n\nIn the last twenty years or so there has been an increase in individuals and the movement expressing their non-theism. This isn't surprising, since there has been an explosion of information about atheism, including news articles, books, documentaries, blog posts, personal accounts by people who have left the faith, and now we have people openly declaring to others that they don't believe in any gods. As a community we've come, seemingly, to accept some of these individuals as apostates from Christianity.\n\nIf you are a religious person who is not Christian, and you are concerned that these people might be apostates, please take note. Even though they are claiming to be atheists, they are not doing that out of laziness or because they don't want to be bothered with religion. Those reasons are not credible. Most of the people claiming to be no-beliefs are not really no-believers in the traditional sense, since most of them clearly feel a profound sense of responsibility for their actions\u2014they don't just declare atheism, they declare that they no longer believe in God. But most of them are not interested in making their case simply for the sake of making it\u2014they are earnest about it because they perceive their lack of belief to be an attack on the religious values they hold sacred.\n\nAt the risk of sounding clich\u00e9, don't be surprised if you see more Christian atheists. This isn't like olden times when Christians were the only ones who could be atheists\u2014now atheism is widespread among non-believers. If you're going to be an atheist Christian, you might as well do it with style.\n\n*See \"How to be Atheists without Being Bad

{"id":2328,"ended":true,"length":716,"gen_text":"When time-traveling became possible, the government was forced to stop people from actually making changes in the past, that could alter the present. You are part of the corps that protects time and your task is it to stop people from killing Hitler and saving the world. If you're killed by him, you can't change history; because he already was killed. And I feel sorry for those people who actually did that in the time of a nuclear bomb, but there are reasons that we didn't make it right now.\n\nThe game is set during a time where the world is on high alert for war, so people have gone into hiding, and the military has created some super-soldiers to control the population. The game opens with a group of guys doing something on TV for some celebrity or news. They see a flash of light and they go into hiding, because we don't want to see more flash of light in the future. These guys live in this little town and are told that it's really the end, and they never get any rest. As part of their training, they are also taught to kill people, and so some of the other guys go with them. One of the other guys sees a flash and when he goes out for a drink one night, he's attacked by soldiers armed with a machine gun. He kills them all, but the gun goes through the television set, stopping the show for two minutes. The people start panicking, and the soldier decides to kill them all. The game ends when the player is found by soldiers and taken away.\n\n\nThe player has to save the president of the United States from assassination. The president gets shot twice in one episode. The player must then find a time machine to send back in the 1960s and save the president. The player can also try and stop Nazi Germany, by stopping Hitler from taking over Europe. The player must then fight a Nazi scientist in the 1940s who is taking over the government. He's wearing a strange looking device that looks like an eyeglass lens over his head. The player fights him and then travels to 1945 with the help of the president's daughter, who has a past of her own. She's part of a resistance that will use time machines to help the player.\n\nThe player travels back in time with Hitler. The game is set in 1944, and the player helps Hitler survive the initial attack. He escapes from prison and the player is given special glasses that make Hitler a little bit younger. This makes him seem more powerful to the enemy, so they can't just shoot him. The player must go through various stages to save the president, and this includes finding a mysterious guy with a gun. He can only see when you're near him and if you shoot him he dies.\n\n\nThe player arrives in a very violent country. This is set in the 1920s, so the player's goal is to free the country from the dictatorship of someone called \"Lord Fuhrer\", who is a tyrant and a dictator with an iron fist. After a guy named Hitler tries to take over the presidency, but is killed in a plane crash. The player has to help organize resistance. Once he meets the resistance leader, he tells him that Fuhrer was actually a good guy and he wasn't evil.\n\n\nThere are a load of time-traveling games and I'm not going to go on to list all them, but I think I have played all of them.

{"id":4267,"ended":true,"length":716,"gen_text":"When time-traveling became possible, the government was forced to stop people from actually making changes in the past, that could alter the present. You are part of the corps that protects time and your task is it to stop people from killing Hitler and saving the world. If you're killed by him, you can't change history; because he already was killed. And I feel sorry for those people who actually did that in the time of a nuclear bomb, but there are reasons that we didn't make it right now.\n\nThe game is set during a time where the world is on high alert for war, so people have gone into hiding, and the military has created some super-soldiers to control the population. The game opens with a group of guys doing something on TV for some celebrity or news. They see a flash of light and they go into hiding, because we don't want to see more flash of light in the future. These guys live in this little town and are told that it's really the end, and they never get any rest. As part of their training, they are also taught to kill people, and so some of the other guys go with them. One of the other guys sees a flash and when he goes out for a drink one night, he's attacked by soldiers armed with a machine gun. He kills them all, but the gun goes through the television set, stopping the show for two minutes. The people start panicking, and the soldier decides to kill them all. The game ends when the player is found by soldiers and taken away.\n\n\nThe player has to save the president of the United States from assassination. The president gets shot twice in one episode. The player must then find a time machine to send back in the 1960s and save the president. The player can also try and stop Nazi Germany, by stopping Hitler from taking over Europe. The player must then fight a Nazi scientist in the 1940s who is taking over the government. He's wearing a strange looking device that looks like an eyeglass lens over his head. The player fights him and then travels to 1945 with the help of the president's daughter, who has a past of her own. She's part of a resistance that will use time machines to help the player.\n\nThe player travels back in time with Hitler. The game is set in 1944, and the player helps Hitler survive the initial attack. He escapes from prison and the player is given special glasses that make Hitler a little bit younger. This makes him seem more powerful to the enemy, so they can't just shoot him. The player must go through various stages to save the president, and this includes finding a mysterious guy with a gun. He can only see when you're near him and if you shoot him he dies.\n\n\nThe player arrives in a very violent country. This is set in the 1920s, so the player's goal is to free the country from the dictatorship of someone called \"Lord Fuhrer\", who is a tyrant and a dictator with an iron fist. After a guy named Hitler tries to take over the presidency, but is killed in a plane crash. The player has to help organize resistance. Once he meets the resistance leader, he tells him that Fuhrer was actually a good guy and he wasn't evil.\n\n\nThere are a load of time-traveling games and I'm not going to go on to list all them, but I think I have played all of them.

{"id":1343,"ended":true,"length":714,"gen_text":"Time and tide wait for no man....\n\nWe need to put those words on the public record\n\nand let people know that this has been a great country\n\nwithout a great king that's been doing it all by himself.\"\n\n-- President Barack Obama\n\n\"He said [King] wasn't a revolutionary. That just didn't sound right. And what he wanted to do was to say, 'This country is so great that this black man has been able to rise so high, and yet he doesn't deserve to have a better life. He's been given a great life with a great future, and that's what we're going to make sure that he sees more of.' That's what his heart was really trying to express.\"\n\n-- Valerie Jarrett, Obama's longtime confidant and the daughter of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, to an interviewer last year about King\n\n\"People have made some of the comments about his relationship with the president, or not having any relationships with him. Actually, we spend hours on the phone, not just talking, but listening to each other.\"\n\n-- King's daughter, Bernice King\n\n\"Martin Luther King, Jr. is a great man. He may not be the best man. At times, he was the best man. But he is a great man.\"\n\n-- Rev. Jesse Jackson\n\nWhen a president takes out a full-page ad that reads \"I have a dream\" it can be a little difficult to hear the truth; it comes from the heart and is sometimes the result of years of reflection. When King makes this claim I feel his sincerity at my own heart, his honest love for a dream that he saw as a child born of his mother's wish for freedom. He saw this dream embodied in those young American men and women on the \"Hallelujah\" bus and in those black mothers and children of the Depression.\n\nBut for the past half century we have watched King's dream falter. We watched him become a target of the white backlash. Today, the dream isn't being fought for by a black leader, but by a white one. He said he saw a young girl in one of his old speeches \"on her knees, hands clasped on the desk in front of her... pleading with him to 'do something about this.'\" She spoke her truth. This dream is being told by a new man in this nation's highest office. Martin Luther King, Jr. is not talking about that young girl and her truth, nor is he talking about any of the children who still are living the nightmare he saw and fought for.\n\nWhen Obama spoke at the Lincoln Memorial on Tuesday he also spoke \"the real truth\" for everyone watching. He said he'd had the privilege to meet King, and \"the thing that Martin brought to our journey, in the end, was the determination to use whatever gifts we have in order to move this country forward.\"\n\nThere was a quote that came to mind as I watched Obama's speech. \"Those who know me know that I was born to a modest middle-class background,\" he said. \"I didn't inherit much. But what I did inherit was the desire and optimism to use every advantage in my life to make the most of it.\"\n\nObama understood the promise of hope; he embraced it in his own life. And even though there have been years when his optimism has seemed more of a dream than anything else, the most hopeful day for our country yet, President Obama said it still is our \"common

{"id":3824,"ended":false,"length":714,"gen_text":"One night the stars do not appear in the sky... but one man in the moon's pale face, who can see all.\" (The Book of Job 38:19 KJV.) That is the way it should be in our time.\n\nThis is not to say there is no God. He does not seem to me so. If God is nothing more than an immaterial being, what he has revealed is so small that if it could exist anywhere in the universe, it could have been found. On the other hand, who can understand the universe better than a man on a planet where God is \"in our midst?\" Who can understand what we are doing or what we are seeking with God if we are alone with Him in the moon?\n\nOne person with the ability to understand can have enormous impact in the lives of others. And I can understand how it impacts people to have someone they can talk with about anything who has seen things most of us cannot see... including what I see with my spiritual eyes in this room. This is not to say I don't like the moon. But it is a wonderful place to live in, but it has the limitations of its place. When we live in the \"heaven above,\" the view may be different than we sometimes realize... just as the view of God on the planet we live on is different from ours. It makes perfect sense to me.\n\nIn that way, I can understand the joy I have when I come upon a Bible verse that expresses something unique to me; it comes from places, experiences and knowledge I would not have had on our planet, yet in this moment it seems to be my own. It has been in the Bible for millennia, I am sure that if someone is reading this and they are a young believer growing up today, those words will come to them over and over. The only difference is where and when it comes from.\n\nI may not understand God any more than people who have been Christians for thousands of years. I can't know him more than they do. But I can feel his presence and see that presence in what I see with my spiritual eyes. That is a joy that can be understood.\n\nJohn 4:34 \"What is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou hast made?\" (JN 4:34 KJV) Here are two things God, my Father in Heaven, gives me to learn\u2013the importance of my creation and the fact that God gave me this earth that I have been given so that I may understand it. How wonderful to believe that the Bible\u2013the Word of God\u2013is the Word of God!\n\nIn conclusion, I want to give you one more word of wisdom: \"For everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord, and whoever is humble in heart is blessed.\" (Proverbs 3:18 KJV)\n\n[For example, don't be ashamed to ask for forgiveness for your mistakes, learn from your mistakes, put yourself in situations where you can get help when you need it, and follow God's example of \"loving\" your neighbor as yourself, when your circumstances might not allow for loving yourself.]\n\nThank you for your interest in speaking to the people in this room. Thank you for your courage to express your questions, be sure to tell us if we are the right venue, and thank you very much for God's love and mercy in this life as well as for life to come.

{"id":3832,"ended":false,"length":724,"gen_text":"A stereotypical love story, where our heroes fall in love and eventually commit to one another. Or at least, that is the idea behind most romantic comedies. That is the way most of the romantic comedies depicted a love story in classic Hollywood films.\n\n\"You know what I hate?\" asks Tom and Jojo of the movie.\n\n\"I hate what he's talking about,\" says Jyoti.\n\n\"Oh, do you have any idea why? It's because it's crap. Everything that they do is crap,\" says Tom. It's hard to tell, with Tom, the actor, which parts of his character are real and which ones are made up.\n\n\"Don't worry about her love life,\" he tells them. \"Just give her time together.\" He then explains that the only thing they should worry about is that she doesn't date the right person who will make things weird during the wedding ceremony.\n\nThey all nod in agreement. \"That's really good,\" they say at the same time.\n\nIn the movie, Tom and Jojo are having very different relationships. Tom has the sort of one-sided love that has been the most common way in movies and television for decades. It's a \"you do what I say, or I'll beat you up\" relationship. He's the good guy, and in return, he gets that perfect woman. He has nothing in common with Jojo, the one he will eventually marry and whose entire personality is an anathema to his own, and yet, the film is centered on what happens after their wedding.\n\nNot that I'm trying to take anything away from their movie; what's done is done and that's that. But in reality, even in a movie, we all love someone for different reasons. I'm not sure if it's just that I think people love movies with lots of love triangles, romantic comedy plots, or just people who have been married for a long, looooong time. It's because we all recognize that some people are attracted to a person in a certain way, and there are people who aren't. But if you can put a loving relationship between people who are attracted to different people for different reasons, that just seems more realistic.\n\nIn real life, I really want to be liked by people. I'm a little narcissistic with who, and I think that some of that can bleed into someone's personality. I think it's natural for a relationship to be that way. It makes sense for people to care about our goals \u2014 to want to pursue a career, or to like someone's brand, or to be loyal \u2014 there's just a lot less pressure when you're dating people we both love for different reasons.\n\nBut there is the possibility that it's just me. After my marriage to my first boyfriend ended, in 2007, I was dating someone very different from the guy that I'll be with for the rest of my life. We had a lot in common in terms of our values and where we were at in life, but there also was something about each of us that I felt was very different. I wondered why I couldn't find a connection to him, why things were a little bit stagnant.

{"id":3962,"ended":false,"length":682,"gen_text":"A Love story written like a rap... I couldn't believe the way that she said everything,\" the man wrote to his wife in response to her response to his marriage proposal.\n\n\"I guess that's the word I would use, a classic.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAnother man shared the letters he'd received, detailing the love he had for his wife. \"I couldn't believe how she made me feel, how she made my cock grow so big, how she made every moment perfect,\" he wrote.\n\nIn each case, the letters, with their messages of admiration, respect and passion, made headlines around the world. \"Love Letters From Famous Men to the Women in Their Lives,\" the Washington Post's own headline declared.\n\nThe letters from Mr. and Mrs. Carter have been collected, edited and republished in Canada and the United States. Some have been quoted during the Carter administration, including Mr. Carter, the Queen and Queen Elizabeth II. Mr. Carter wrote from his perspective as the leader of the country.\n\nAnd, although they are very different from the letters he wrote while in office, Mr. Carter has shared the story so often in the United States that it has been the subject of a children's book, the 2006 release of which had Mr. Carter thanking his wife and children personally.\n\nWhile most people assume that the letters are simply from ex-wives trying to convince their husbands to come home, Mr. Carter has denied that the letters are from his wives. In response to repeated requests for comment, his office said Mr. Carter had nothing to say on the matter.\n\nThere has been no official response from the Carter family since the letters were published, according to an aide to George Bush.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhile the letters were written almost 50 years ago, it is Mr. Carter's family's position that they are still relevant today for a number of reasons, Mr. Carter's son said in an interview.\n\nThe letters, the aide said, \"tremendously exemplify how President Carter's commitment to public service, his passion for spreading peace and understanding across the world and his understanding of the family have helped shape who he is today.\"\n\nMr. Carter, who was an undergraduate chemistry student in Canada during the first of these letters, decided to pursue a PhD, working as a postdoctoral scholar at the Toronto-area chemical park. He eventually obtained a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University after winning a competition for excellence in engineering.\n\nHe returned to Canada to teach at the university, then joined the staff of his alma mater, the University of Winnipeg, where he studied agriculture policy.\n\nMr. Carter was elected commander-in-chief of the Northern Command in 1977, and became director of national intelligence in 1981. While he did the intelligence part, he also served in several high-profile positions for which he was widely acclaimed, including acting as national security adviser (1989-91) and as U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain (1993-1995).\n\n\"There are lots of things that he has been known for because of his accomplishments in government, but when you think about his commitment to families in the arts, in the private sector \u2013 he has a very active support system for those same causes,\" Mr. Carter's son said.\n\n\"I think there is a very strong sense in his family that he will go down in history as an exceptional human being for his leadership in all those areas, regardless of what his day-to-day tasks are. I think the letters continue to stand up as testament to

{"id":2593,"ended":true,"length":688,"gen_text":"You are hired to write the holy text for a new religion. What is the first chapter of the text?\n\nIs it in English? Hebrew?\n\n\nIt might be.\n\nWhat is the basic idea behind the religion?\n\nTo be the true, true religion in the time of Jesus Christ, and the savior of humanity.\n\nYou write about the origins of the group and its beliefs. Where do they go back?\n\nTo the time of King Solomon.\n\nIn what way is the group new?\n\nIt is a new religion. It is not old. Everything that Judaism and Christianity have taught us about God and Jesus Christ are completely wrong. Not one. Not two. If you want to know more than that, you should go to Google and learn the truth.\n\nAre members required to share their beliefs openly?\n\nAbsolutely. Anyone is welcome and is free to be a part of the religion. We do not discriminate based on race, faith, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or nationality.\n\n\nIt also helps that the organization was founded by a man who was a homosexual who found God through his relationship with a teenage boy. He is a living legend in the gay community. His story has been shared by countless celebrities and is still being retold today.\n\nWhy did you write the book?\n\nAlthough God chose to provide the Messiah to save mankind from its sinfulness and bring about everlasting life, that salvation is not without costs. God gave mankind the opportunity to fall like a hot-knife through bread dough, but the very price that mankind must pay, is a steep price. In light of what mankind has suffered in this life, we believe that there is little reason to believe that in the next life mankind will be as perfect as it is here, where we find our happiness. We also believe that God will not reward those who will not seek Him. The only way that mankind can truly attain eternal bliss is through the Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nWhen people meet me, I want to show them what I believe in. I have given my credibility away, and it is very important that I make sure I am known.\n\nWill you be able to share the book with people who are not familiar with your background?\n\nWith the exception of the first 20 pages, the book is absolutely free to read online and to download for free. I would like to encourage people to download the book, read it, and share it with anyone that they believe needs to be told the truth.\n\nWhere can they find more information?\n\nI have written a brief synopsis of the book. The book is a two-hour mini-documentary, which can be watched on YouTube or viewed on your computer, tablet, or phone. The trailer for the documentary was released on YouTube on February 15, 2016. Click here to watch it today!\n\nThis book is about to start in the United States!\n\nOn June 28, 2016, I will be launching this book in the United States! We are going to be launching in Los Angeles and New York.

{"id":971,"ended":true,"length":688,"gen_text":"You are hired to write the holy text for a new religion. What is the first chapter of the text?\n\nIs it in English? Hebrew?\n\n\nIt might be.\n\nWhat is the basic idea behind the religion?\n\nTo be the true, true religion in the time of Jesus Christ, and the savior of humanity.\n\nYou write about the origins of the group and its beliefs. Where do they go back?\n\nTo the time of King Solomon.\n\nIn what way is the group new?\n\nIt is a new religion. It is not old. Everything that Judaism and Christianity have taught us about God and Jesus Christ are completely wrong. Not one. Not two. If you want to know more than that, you should go to Google and learn the truth.\n\nAre members required to share their beliefs openly?\n\nAbsolutely. Anyone is welcome and is free to be a part of the religion. We do not discriminate based on race, faith, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or nationality.\n\n\nIt also helps that the organization was founded by a man who was a homosexual who found God through his relationship with a teenage boy. He is a living legend in the gay community. His story has been shared by countless celebrities and is still being retold today.\n\nWhy did you write the book?\n\nAlthough God chose to provide the Messiah to save mankind from its sinfulness and bring about everlasting life, that salvation is not without costs. God gave mankind the opportunity to fall like a hot-knife through bread dough, but the very price that mankind must pay, is a steep price. In light of what mankind has suffered in this life, we believe that there is little reason to believe that in the next life mankind will be as perfect as it is here, where we find our happiness. We also believe that God will not reward those who will not seek Him. The only way that mankind can truly attain eternal bliss is through the Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nWhen people meet me, I want to show them what I believe in. I have given my credibility away, and it is very important that I make sure I am known.\n\nWill you be able to share the book with people who are not familiar with your background?\n\nWith the exception of the first 20 pages, the book is absolutely free to read online and to download for free. I would like to encourage people to download the book, read it, and share it with anyone that they believe needs to be told the truth.\n\nWhere can they find more information?\n\nI have written a brief synopsis of the book. The book is a two-hour mini-documentary, which can be watched on YouTube or viewed on your computer, tablet, or phone. The trailer for the documentary was released on YouTube on February 15, 2016. Click here to watch it today!\n\nThis book is about to start in the United States!\n\nOn June 28, 2016, I will be launching this book in the United States! We are going to be launching in Los Angeles and New York.

{"id":1765,"ended":true,"length":682,"gen_text":"So you just woke up, went downstairs for a cup of joe, and now you're standing face to face with an alligator. It's already taken over your recliner, and has told you that it has no intentions of leaving. \"\n\nIt was in the year 2000 that the first alligator attack incident was recorded in Florida. In 2003, the state legislature adopted a law to protect alligators that are found in residential areas from harming people or harming crops.\n\n\"You never know when you're going to live through something like this. And no, it isn't like it's happening in Yellowstone again. This is Florida.\"\n\nA year later, alligators were found with two other alligators who were found feeding on their young on North Florida's Okeechobee. In 2004, alligators were illegally captured and released into the Everglades.\n\nAlligators have been killing pets, horses and other living creatures for centuries.\n\nThis incident can be considered one of the world's first big gators vs. humans fights, and there's a very big difference between fighting a gator vs. a person. People who have dealt with alligators have said in the years since this gator attack that not only have they seen a few big gators, but they've seen a lot of gators.\n\nAlligators have been attacking humans in the wild for generations. The first recorded case of a gator killing a human occurred in 1868, when a young boy was killed on the banks of the San River in the Florida Everglades.\n\nAn even more recent Florida case is documented in 2013 when a woman was badly injured and nearly killed after she and her husband were attacked by a gator in North Florida, and a wild dog that had jumped into their house after their dog had died of starvation attacked them at the same time.\n\nThe gator was shot dead by authorities and a wild dog is being treated at a local animal shelter.\n\nThese gators fighting in the Florida area were not aggressive. The only thing that makes this one so interesting is the method of attack, which is an alligator trying its hardest to rip the person's clothes, clothes of the pet dog, clothes of the pet horse, and clothing of the pet cat. This isn't what you see in the movies, people being bit and gator bites. The gator is just protecting its territory. If you had a wild dog that just wanted to bite you and eat you, would you let it live or kill it? Even less likely would you allow it to roam, since you know that it will kill it's family in the process.\n\nIf you are seeing a gator in that particular area, and if it is a wild gator, you need to get the hell over there. If alligators can be brought legally to the Florida Everglades where they belong, then it is their \"natural habitat,\" not some place that someone stole from a zoo.\n\nIt could be that this case and others like it are what really scares people in the Florida area, since no one has ever heard of an alligator attacking someone in the United States for hundreds of years. There could be millions of alligators just waiting to take over the Everglades.\n\nIf you have seen a gator in the wild in Florida, you need to let someone know about it because the more people who

{"id":2082,"ended":false,"length":725,"gen_text":"( WP ) It's lonely at the top, 'cept for that one dude.\n\nThat's right, we're talking about our favorite webcomic's second strip. I knew we had to keep the idea in our minds, because as soon as we started thinking about that we knew that this was right up our alley. As soon as the comic ended, we started looking for the next story to draw.\n\nThe first story actually has no story?\n\nIn the first one it's pretty much told in dialogue, but with the second one I had to find a way to make it into something else. Like, the comic's over, what do we do?\n\nWe found the theme for the strip in the first one, which was loneliness. But we also learned a lesson: that when your readers hate your comics, you can't go on, you can't draw a new comic, you can't write a new story. But you can stay with your fans. And the thing is, you don't have to feel bad for those readers. They were probably just too dumb to realize how cool your strip is. (I'm talking to ourselves, here.)\n\nIt's like, when something makes you angry, you feel bad about your own actions, but when you finally look deep inside yourself, you find yourself more angry with the people standing between you and that thing in your brain instead. The two are equal, and your anger is directed against the actual source of the thing, not your own actions. It's very Zen, if you think about it.\n\n[ ] what exactly happened during the making of this comic I should ask I'm trying to think of a good question\n\n[ ] What I like best about this is the idea\n\n[x] what will be your next comic?\n\n[ ] I'm going to make it out of duct tape and paperclips\n\nThe first strip was made entirely with Google, for which I thank you in advance. We had no way of knowing until we got to the strip what the internet would bring us, so we just drew with what we had.\n\nWhen you're not on the page, you're somewhere else.\n\nI started working on this strip for about 2 years. We tried on the off chance that it would make us famous. The comic won over our first readers, but we never really took off, so we kept going. We kept writing for this strip because we thought that the characters were worth seeing more than they were worth saying. It was a way of writing to ourselves that said, \"Look, guys. We're doing this all for you, right here, right now. We wouldn't even know where to start if it weren't for you. If we didn't have this strip, how the hell would we make our living writing comics?\"\n\nWe kept going to the strip for months, but after a year, once I gave up on it completely, it just didn't have the same impact. There was plenty of good strips in terms of what you can do when you're not in the office. The problem is, once you're in the office, you need to be making comics to work. So we put it all behind us, and I think the next time we see each other I'll be doing my own thing on my own thing.\n\nThe only good thing we have going for us right now is that we have access to a nice piece of machinery: email.

{"id":1640,"ended":false,"length":681,"gen_text":"an unhappy person gains the superpower of mind control.\n\nIn one short example of the power of the mind controlling method of mind control, in 1970, a psychologist Dr. Eric Berne created a system of mind-counters which enabled him to hypnotize people into using drugs with him.\n\nAnother simple example of the power of the mind controlling method is to see how a person can be influenced into becoming completely apathetic towards the world around them. In the movie Men In Black the main characters are forced into the role of slaves who can only look forward to the return of their old masters. A key part of our brain chemistry is the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine. In the movie Men In Black, the old masters brainwash the group with the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin (both controlled by the dopamine and the serotonin receptors). The mind controlling method will lead to the release of an abundance of these neurotransmitters, resulting in a high level of excitement for entertainment.\n\nAnother very simple examples of the control of our thoughts and emotions will become very clear in a second. The main ingredient of the mind controlling method is the use of hypnosis. An individual using mind controlling methods will be able to hypnotize their victim (the victim will only feel what the hypnotist wants them to feel).\n\nAnother method of brainwashing is to use the brainwashing games. The brainwashing games are two videos. They are played by video game characters. They are played in such a way that one thinks it is real and then the game character says very specific words using brain wave frequencies and\/or the frequency of light. In this case, the words said by the playing characters must be in a specific brain wave frequency. If a subject is not hypnotized then they cannot do the two games properly.\n\nAnother common component of brainwashing games is the use of music. Again the lyrics are played. There are three major games with the music:\n\nFirst, if you know the lyrics of the song, you play the game.\n\nSecond, if you know the lyrics of the song backwards, you play the game backwards.\n\nThird, if you do not know the lyrics of the song but you know the melody and the words, you play the game backwards backwards and you think it is real.\n\nIn these games, the person playing the game is the star of the show. A person playing the game, does not think for themselves but has to follow the instructions from the player. The game then becomes part of one's self. When the brainwashing games are played, the main theme for each game is to take control over a person. This theme can be anything such as:\n\n- To control your children\n\n- To control the people around you\n\n- To control the world around you\n\n- To be rich or wealthy - and more!\n\nIn our next article in the series, we will discuss the use of drugs in the mind-control game. It is essential to have at least two methods (including drug use) in the minds of the victim so that the mind controlling method can be used in every situation.\n\nIf you have not already done so, it is important to get a copy of The Mind Manipulators Handbook.\n\nFor more information on The Mind Manipulators Handbook, go to my website at:\n\nJourney to Enlightenment Part 1 Chapter 1: Mind Over

''\n\n'''\n\n\nThis is really just the tip of the iceberg\n\nThe fact is\n\nWith all the bad things we do\n\nPeople actually want to help\n\nIt's hard to put into words but it's simple really\n\nThat's all\n\nJust because we have so many\n\nIt doesn't mean\n\nThere's nothing you can do about it\n\nWe're all victims\n\nAll together we're victims\n\n\n'Cause people who can afford it\n\nWould rather do bad things for it all\n\nthan do good things for the earth\n\n\nFor our generation\n\nThe best we can expect\n\nIs to be a laughing stock in the eyes\n\nof the next generation\n\nJust like everything else we did wrong\n\n\nAnd I'm telling ya, Frank\n\nThe more bad we do\n\nThe more coal gets\n\nThe more coal gets\n\nThe more coal gets\n\n\nIt's a really good thing\n\n'Cause it means\n\nWe can mine more coal\n\nTo give to you\n\nNow we can put ourselves\n\nIn the best possible place to live\n\nWhat's great about the way it works\n\nIs that\n\nNow we can make the best of our lot\n\nWith every problem\n\nNow we can fix it\n\n'Cause we can\n\nWe're all victims\n\nAll together we're victims\n\n\nEverywhere we go\n\nWe're treated bad\n\nBut we give, and we get the worst\n\nWe don't blame anyone\n\nFor the way things are at the top\n\n\nWhen all the lights are flickering\n\nThey don't see the stars\n\nBecause we don't see the sky\n\n'Cause those lights don't work\n\nBecause somebody else's greed\n\nIs blinding us all\n\nThe coal that was put to good use\n\nWhen people like me\n\nStart burning it, it makes me feel bad\n\n\n'Cause when the coal\n\nFlows away\n\nI can't see the road\n\nWhen you're all right\n\nSo you burn the rest\n\nOf it all\n\nWhat's important is that you remember\n\n'Cause now we're all victims\n\nAnd we can't go back\n\nNow we're all victims\n\nWe, us, us, us\n\n\nFor our generation\n\nThe best we can expect\n\nIs to be a laughing stock in the eyes\n\nof the next generation\n\nJust like everything else we did wrong\n\nWe can all fix it\n\nSo we can make the best of our lot\n\nWith every problem\n\nNow we can fix it\n\n'Cause we can\n\nWe're all victims\n\nAll together we're victims\n\n\nIn our day\n\nEverywhere we go\n\nWe're treated bad\n\nBut we give, and we get the worst\n\nWe don't blame anyone\n\nFor the way things are at the top\n\nI'll remind you\n\nWhen all the lights are

{"id":4922,"ended":false,"length":697,"gen_text":"You wake up as per normal this morning. You find out that it's 2016 and you try to piece together 2015 using pictures from your phone or Facebook. You look over your bank statements for the past month and wonder who the heck sent them to you in the first place. You look up the date and it's actually the end of April. All your plans are ruined but you have nothing to lose so you make plans right now.\n\nThe question is, are you really ready to face the truth about your childhood?\n\nHere is 5-Step How to Deal With your Childhood Mistakes & Problems:\n\n1) Set your goals.\n\nDo you want to improve your health? Lose weight? Learn something new with your child? Maybe you want to find your passion now? Or maybe you want to know your dream job in the upcoming school year? Whatever it is, figure out what you can do that will help you move forward and set your goals. Set your priorities, and go find a goal you can hit.\n\n2) Write down the positive things.\n\nMaybe you learned the difference between \"nice\" and \"nasty\" from your parents. Maybe you got that cute dress you wanted for your upcoming wedding. Maybe you learned a lesson about the importance of listening. Whatever the positive memories, get them written down right now.\n\n3) Use the \"What if\" exercises.\n\nThere are so many things we don't choose to do but that we can choose to start. Do you regret the way you did something important in your life? What if it could have happened differently? What if you would have known that? Does your childhood give you insight about the problems in your life?\n\nCreate your own \"what if\" exercises involving any life issues that you feel powerless in dealing with. You're not alone! We all have these issues in our lives.\n\nIf this sounds like you, then start the exercises by going through what you did correctly in your life and re-writing it in your own words. It won't be as easy as using an online therapist, but at least it will get you thinking at least.\n\nOnce you have completed your exercises, have a moment to think. What would you do differently?\n\n4) Take a timeout.\n\nAs you continue your life, your childhood should become less and less important. If you're having tough weeks, take a minute now to let your issues go and realize that it's time to focus on who, where, and how you are doing it now\u2013not how your mom raised you. You are who you are now, that's good enough! If your life does not revolve around you, then why bother staying?\n\n5) Embrace change.\n\nIt might have seemed like life had stopped revolving around you, but this simple move is actually going to give your life much more purpose. How much would you pay to get a new job right now? A new car?

{"id":3077,"ended":false,"length":701,"gen_text":"Tell a story through only one side of a telephone call................\n\nThe telephone is the perfect storytelling instrument for sharing the real and intimate truths of our lives to the public, wherever we may be. As you have already experienced, using phone calls to share stories and anecdotes is not difficult. The only challenge is using your imagination and skill to tell your stories in a way that will interest others. In this course, you will have the opportunity to learn how to use the telephone effectively to share the real and intimate truths of your life. It's hard to tell our children stories\u2014especially tales of hardship, failure or victory\u2014without using the telephone to do so.\n\nIt has been said that \"the telephone tells the truth without lies, but it tells them the opposite.\" The truth is, what we speak on the telephone never comes completely out of our mouths.\n\nIn this intensive course you will use your imagination to tell a story, based on a real event or situation. In your telling, you will try to capture not only what happened, but how it was experienced. From your own personal experience, the way you tell the story will be influenced, to some extent, by the people around you: your parents, grandparents or close friends, who are the main audience for your story.\n\nThis course's objective is to introduce you to the most effective ways of telling a story, based on three basic methods. The first method you will learn is to tell through the telephone. The second method is using a tape recorder and a paper recorder. The third method you will learn is to tell the story in person, at the location where the story is told.\n\nYou will be guided through this course with the help of an experienced facilitator who will be your guide through the learning process.\n\nThis class is intended for individuals who have been through one or more of the following:\n\n\u2022 A course in story telling\n\n\u2022 Training in storytelling; or,\n\n\u2022 A course at a community college, the workplace or the library\n\nWhat Are You Waiting For?...

{"id":3092,"ended":false,"length":672,"gen_text":"A hero confronts the villain in a final showdown, only to find out that their roles have been reversed the entire time.\n\nIn one short example of this trope, the hero finds that he has been switched with another man with half his powers. While he never figures out what actually happened to him, he does learn that everything he's done has brought about his own personal apocalypse. This is similar to Reverse Faker when the player is faced with a situation they weren't meant to be in, but that turns out to be a lie or was actually part of the game plan. On the other hand, this can also be used to reverse a character's transformation for the good since the character may have been forced into it against their will. In this trope, the villains always figure out more about what's going on than the hero, either through their use of Reverse Faker or their use of the Plot Coupon. Alternatively, the villains will either realize that there's more to it and reveal it to the hero, or will discover the key elements of the hero's plan, reveal it in a way that doesn't get too out-of-hand, and let the hero run with it for a bit until everything blows over.\n\nIf the villain is one of the heroes, this is also the point when the villain realizes they may be losing the Game. This is why characters who fall in love don't usually end up having a Reset Button.\n\nSee also The Game Has Changed, when that's what they find out after being played.\n\nThe common thread in a lot of such situations is that when the baddie finds out what's happened, they find the rest of the characters on their own, completely unaware of the truth. This is rarely ever a good thing, as it's almost always done simply for the sake of making the villains look less villainous. On the other hand, if the villain is the Hero, this is what happens when the heroes actually realize what's happened. If the villain is the Hero's Guardian Dog, this will be him revealing the whole truth; if the Big Bad is the Hero's Best Friend, then the big bad will be revealed to have been hiding something all along.\n\nA Sub-Trope of Hero Is Selfish. The difference here is that one is generally the good guy who isn't actually that good, and the other is the bad guy.\n\nCompare The Plot Deception, What Happens in Vegas?, and Reverse Faker. Contrast Faker!, Faker Myths, and Villainous Breakdown.\n\nContrast Game Master Is Always Right. Also compare If This Is a Story About Heroes, Whom the Gods Will Hate.\n\nExamples:\n\nopen\/close all folders\n\nComic Books\n\nFan Works\n\nFilms \u2014 Animation\n\nFilms \u2014 Live-Action\n\nLiterature\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nMusic Videos\n\nIn the video for the cover of the The Slits song \"Tearful (Foie Gras)\", the main character and her girlfriend are faced (actually, in the beginning) with two seemingly identical characters playing identical characters to them.\n\nThe song \"Rome\" from the band Nine Inch Nails' album The Downward Spiral has a similar plot twist. The song tells the tale of \"Holly\" from the year 3000, as she becomes \"Juliet\" to find out (and ultimately realizes) that the world she'd been living in was (and was not) the one she'd heard about for so long... before it turned out to be just a dream.\n\nVideo Games\n\nWeb Comics\n\nWeb Original\n\nWestern

{"id":3549,"ended":true,"length":733,"gen_text":"There aren't enough female superheroes out there. Make a new heroine origin story, and I dare anyone in the comic book industry to stop doing it.\n\nThe fact is, women make up 51% of comic book readers. There are enough female heroes out there.\n\nThis wasn't done on purpose, but the fact is that there aren't enough female superheroes and thus the comic book industry has no choice but to include more of them. Female comics have gone from being relegated to the lowest echelons of being a genre to now being a mainstream format of comics and a mainstay of the industry. As for characters like Thor, who is a completely male character, what's his appeal to women? Why wouldn't any woman want more male characters in her comics? Are women really too brainwashed?\n\nThis trope can be considered to be a form of Cultural Marxism, because it uses cultural, racial and religious traditions as a way to convince people who have been made to believe that they won't be able to enjoy a certain thing in any way that that is a thing that is not something that they enjoy. This is done so that the reader is forced to not only believe that a certain thing is not something that they feel comfortable enjoying, but that they can only enjoy something by subscribing to these prejudices. So what if women aren't able to go see a male-led superhero movie because they don't want to see a man in a red cape that isn't blue, and so on and so forth? Why would you require female-led movies to include less male characters than male-led movies? Why is a film by a woman required to include only male characters when a film by a man is simply allowed? That logic simply breaks down upon a first examination. I am a woman. I do not want to see another man in a different costume. Period.\n\nThe feminist stereotype that says that the only way to have a woman's perspective is with a male protagonist was put forth years ago during the Bronze Age of Comics. They said that women, because of their gender, weren't given enough roles in their comics. This trope has since been seen with women being reduced to their sexuality, only being allowed to have interest in one gender or another regardless of their intelligence or personality. If you aren't willing to think for yourself, you aren't allowed to enjoy a thing. You want to see more female characters? I'm taking you somewhere that will teach you a valuable lesson. You want to see more women heroes? I'm taking you somewhere where you can start your own business that will employ and increase your workforce, and thus increase your income.\n\nI really believe this is just one of those things that goes hand-in-hand with gender issues in general. It also has to do with the fact that society now allows more women to be artists and entertainers than men, and these same women are being brought in to teach men in the industry by helping them to grow, becoming more skilled, more successful and also adding to the culture of their industry. Let me clarify, men in the industry can be as good as most women, but it would be much harder to achieve success when you put them up against a group of females, because they are already so far down on the totem pole because of a sexist perception in the public eye that is very much out of hand as to where it is at. You simply cannot make the argument that the only way to have women in comics is through giving them role models on par with men as well as a focus on their sexuality.\n\nI hope that my point here has been made clear. The gender-gap issue of comic books can't be solved any other way than to have more women in comics.","token_len":761,"entropy":[6.0196,0.0006,2.5912,5.5047,3.9356,2.3217,0.0078,1.7003,8.1435,2.6246,3.3018,4.9479,11.7916,0.4707,2.0047,1.9531,2.8036,5.9041,4.7473,5.3183,0.609,2.857,0.7334,0.5586,0.1381,4.3771,5.7901,0.184,0.857,1.2166,0.0045,3.1128,3.7687,1.4636,0.4843,2.5987,4.1598,0.1844,6.0562,0.8288,0.0089,2.4091,0.1786,0.2174,1.245,3.8129,0.6998,4.5726,1.1257,2.0929,0.8939,0.0032,0.9759,3.1113,0.0002,4.1278,5.6467,0.0005,5.9638,2.7027,0.1297,1.3184,1.0809,2.3257,1.8227,0.7457,1.2885,1.9316,1.1134,0.0003,0.0532,0.0784,0.1404,6.4569,5.5843,2.5339,3.5799,0.2437,0.1457,1.7681,2.8306,0.7557,0.0425,0.0085,4.2661,1.4149,1.3318,0.044,0.2998,5.8524,4.4255,2.4401,5.6429,1.0265,1.7954,4.4061,0.0534,1.0897,6.1043,4.8927,0.2888,0.0008,0.1942,6.485,1.9266,5.2643,1.0411,3.1965,0.4752,2.0832,2.1629,5.1398,3.9709,2.7733,2.9135,2.9467,3.8777,0.5894,0.6152,0.676,1.2481,0.1583,4.9661,3.991,5.9337,0.6828,4.4146,0.6997,3.6796,1.8325,1.7226,5.8117,2.906,0.582,0.587,5.2872,1.9766,3.4613,5.5974,1.8806,1.3398,0.3884,3.2627,4.1802,0.0005,4.0793,0.7152,0.6755,7.0282,3.526,0.9629,1.1578,1.3502,1.7452,0.2173,5.6034,1.6883,3.0053,3.9023,5.538,0.3941,4.5536,0.7849,0.0002,3.621,6.4391,4.2698,0.5478,4.744,2.7306,0.3164,1.1099,2.0862,0.0048,5.3138,0.3256,1.4793,3.1997,0.6684,4.801,4.4332,5.2597,3.3974,1.1698,3.2711,5.7904,1.4924,0.7356,1.783,0.2383,4.6552,0.9753,4.6067,2.3834,2.3723,5.429,0.2672,1.3515,1.3158,1.339,7.4614,0.002,0.6106,1.4088,0.0047,2.8064,1.8783,1.3198,2.2031,4.1426,4.3104,0.9393,1.2982,2.5583,2.0868,2.1656,4.047,0.6149,1.6347,1.8099,4.9172,0.813,0.7408,4.0103,0.3551,2.514,0.9416,3.2142,3.4904,0.3253,1.6018,3.1721,1.6506,2.1961,0.1166,4.3891,0.6631,2.6198,0.4943,2.6761,0.7569,0.4995,0.3301,0.8825,1.1867,0.5562,0.1619,5.6919,1.5591,2.086,0.2447,0.0546,1.219,1.2406,3.6844,2.5539,0.3,1.7917,3.7844,3.9641,0.0256,4.8743,5.1238,0.4031,5.1031,3.7174,2.4293,2.5106,3.0112,0.0003,4.5579,0.0144,5.1318,2.4292,1.2489,3.6077,1.9989,0.9799,0.7061,0.2667,2.7013,1.0088,1.8681,0.0004,0.9127,0.051,0.7033,0.7155,1.4236,1.3012,0.3328,3.987,1.4573,4.8803,4.4897,0.0003,4.1506,2.6758,1.9788,2.6679,1.258,0.9484,0.0055,0.0872,0.6022,3.5865,2.8275,1.9302,5.6229,5.225,2.4236,0.2918,1.8123,0.6872,2.8534,6.2597,1.2647,0.4068,2.7627,0.4596,0.0552,0.0135,0.3035,0.4651,2.1678,2.4267,3.4488,3.8083,5.8473,0.2886,0.7149,3.68,0.0449,2.2088,3.7186,1.7539,0.1883,2.9744,0.8357,0.1584,0.169,0.0381,0.0736,0.9904,5.3146,1.5133,3.2421,4.8669,5.6713,3.9782,5.6322,0.1397,5.3672,2.7647,3.5329,2.9833,0.3781,5.2798,3.3183,2.0772,1.4093,2.1567,0.4566,3.4684,0.1029,1.2525,0.3044,0.2249,4.274,1.8352,0.3327,0.0921,6.9323,1.024,0.9984,5.1918,0.0228,1.2724,0.0002,2.2472,5.6964,5.8434,1.9507,3.7469,0.8117,3.4153,1.062,0.9593,1.125,2.5017,0.4236,1.8788,3.185,2.6177,0.7889,4.9312,0.2953,1.3877,2.4428,4.3193,4.7572,1.6089,4.5428,0.0765,5.3346,0.2128,5.2462,0.0295,1.1875,0.9001,0.9016,4.9373,2.7457,0.2186,1.283,5.0465,1.9516,0.6684,0.5996,2.7147,0.1446,4.2912,0.0002,6.3335,2.8289,4.2044,0.6635,3.7247,1.8418,0.8919,2.375,3.4725,1.9853,2.3882,0.4957,5.2953,4.7289,4.1219,2.273,4.3841,0.1072,3.3178,1.3004,1.3991,5.3682,1.3561,1.5791,0.2357,1.7862,5.9762,0.0684,2.6236,3.2237,1.2094,0.7745,6.5193,0.0307,1.3208,4.7166,1.2276,3.0452,0.6035,4.3003,1.5087,4.7693,0.0002,3.2883,0.0089,5.9679,1.194,0.0658,0.6917,1.5644,1.9916,0.0002,1.6734,0.0527,2.8828,1.3785,3.7961,0.5683,3.189,4.955,0.6793,1.8049,2.5698,1.4835,1.0622,1.1738,3.8758,1.9452,6.5912,2.2266,2.7312,2.1401,2.3179,2.6669,0.0421,2.7521,2.7139,0.1318,0.6889,2.4594,0.7955,0.2711,0.2346,0.6648,2.6896,3.4308,0.3799,0.9091,0.3478,0.4298,0.0079,0.6849,2.1132,0.8255,1.455,5.7179,3.1562,0.1921,3.6734,3.2944,0.7677,3.8216,3.8733,5.9129,1.9914,4.794,3.0191,1.1622,3.892,2.1633,0.7598,1.6093,0.3719,1.2983,0.0002,2.553,5.5935,3.733,3.8911,1.0674,3.5201,2.5643,1.0529,0.8445,1.1998,0.3969,4.7238,2.9777,0.8312,0.0095,0.0033,0.0016,0.0181,5.2133,3.7064,1.8681,1.7655,0.444,2.3452,5.8153,2.7295,0.4664,0.0339,0.0119,1.1035,1.0823,0.0087,4.8611,5.1663,4.6971,3.4691,2.0726,0.395,1.4925,4.1699,1.1418,4.8836,0.0276,1.1327,1.2667,1.3637,1.2381,4.932,4.2375,0.9333,0.9122,3.2239,5.4976,2.3811,0.4357,5.2922,2.5031,4.2673,1.1236,1.5204,6.8252,5.5301,0.4389,2.4037,3.5919,3.2863,5.5306,1.6283,3.5562,1.5602,1.9843,2.8718,1.0447,5.6032,5.6368,1.0722,0.4365,3.1637,0.8844,2.361,1.7167,0.2967,5.8334,1.7675,5.3263,1.8918,4.984,3.0894,0.3247,0.4761,2.6558,1.9775,3.2809,2.3438,0.3794,6.6503,0.2512,0.9947,0.4549,2.6358,4.0335,0.5989,3.6055,1.7687,1.0409,3.711,4.0446,3.7375,0.8967,5.7007,2.9528,2.3823,0.014,1.3884,2.1425,0.127,4.0863,2.9872,1.5115,1.6546,1.5594,3.2898,2.8167,2.2974,2.4332,1.855,0.1311,0.7398,0.0168,4.9206,0.2712,4.7071,3.234,4.8266,3.5716,1.1488,2.7194,2.514,2.3261,2.8924,4.9943,2.4924,3.3902,0.1866,3.2373,5.7573,2.1876,2.205,1.179,0.8931,2.3231,1.2695,4.3154,4.4324,0.9893,3.7699,2.4552,1.4543,0.1428,2.5151,2.5955,0.4061,0.4143,1.4495,2.5281,0.8463,2.7489,0.1225,3.018,6.2799,0.3166,5.427,0.1057,5.6936,2.7235,0.0229,0.6289,4.9848,2.049,0.1613,3.169

'There's a really good chance they 'll end up just making things worse - just like this child,' she added, pointing at her daughter.\n\n\nThe shocking letter is the latest in a string of disturbing messages sent to the two girls, with one boy calling the two 'fat pieces of shit' for looking like girls.\n\nCalled: A student at a South Korean university, Kim says she has faced a steady stream of abuse while dressing like a female\n\nOne of Mr Kim's former school mates, who attended the same school, told the magazine that he often faced bullying, and once even had a knife pulled on him after a fight erupted about some of the girls he had dated.\n\n\nThe source said: 'When we'd meet up on the train he'd try to act like he didn 't care and he was really cocky. I think he was jealous of girls because he wasn 't like those others.'\n\n\nKim, whose parents are in their eighties, had been bullied at her previous school in Seoul and at the military school in California she graduated from earlier this year. At both places, Kim said she endured unwanted comments about her appearance that she had to avoid.\n\n\nMr Kim, a Korean language student, has also said that she was abused, and described her as a 'f***ing bitch' in messages posted this week on his blog at mydailymail.co.uk.\n\n\nMr Kim told MailOnline that if anyone is worried they can find out more about how to protect themselves from bullies at this website.\n\n\nHe said:'I just want people to realize that these comments are actually saying that these people are just saying that we could be friends, but when we go to school they're bullying us to be friends with something else. So it's very very rare.\n\n\n'It's also about the people you're fighting with. He said he had found 'no evidence' that the girls had said they were actually girls.\n\n\n' I' m sorry that I've ended up in this kind of situation.'\n\nBut she added:'I don't actually think I would even say it for this to happen to me. I've said things like that to people that I would never say to someone I love. '\n\n\nKim said she had told a friend about the threatening messages earlier this week, who then called police.\n\nHowever, police have yet to speak to the school staff about her account.\n\n\nMrs Sommers, the mother, said that no one from the school had heard from her about her daughter in the past week, since the incident, and has contacted her in case of any problems.\n\nShe told MailOnline:'I don't know how I can reach somebody - how do I try to help her?\n\n\n'She has told me if I don't get a response in a matter of hours to get a restraining order put on the school, she 'd

{"id":1010,"ended":false,"length":716,"gen_text":"An Evil Wizard has threatened to take over the world. His powers grow stronger the more people fear him. You, the Media, have to scientifically explain each of his feats to prevent him getting stronger.\n\nA Magic User has been exposed to an unknown magic spell that causes them to forget their name. In this situation, it is only a matter of time before they commit suicide.\n\nSomeone has suddenly gained complete immunity from magic. Then after that, they are suddenly weak to it. If this fails to work, they will commit suicide.\n\nA villain is so evil that he seems to exist to destroy the world. When that happens, it will always be their fault that the world doesn't work.\n\nWhen the world is at peace, a character will have a superpower they use to break away from their role as the world's oppressor, making them a hero to the audience. These heroes are usually called the \"Anti-Villain\" because their exploits often go against the core plot of the story. They can also go so far as to become a hero who works alongside the main story.\n\nA popular Super Powers fic contains a world in which evil and good get along. When the evil one fails, however, they are exiled from the world, but never truly disappear. Evil can still lurk in the world, and even if they get back (and are still deemed to have \"failed\") the evil will often be just as strong without them, and they may always have those who oppose them to work against. The two main differences are that good people are still around to protect the world from these monsters, and they will never forget their former enemies. And when the baddie is defeated, he, and only he, is forgotten, never to return.\n\nSuperpower fic with an evil twist is a little more subtle in this regard. When evil acts as a Super Powers user, it may be a case of a hero having to make enemies on purpose, or just naturally losing interest. In other cases, villains will act entirely differently when their powers are taken away, as seen in \"The Power of the Pendant\" when a member of Team Batman tries to use one of his heroes' weaknesses against him.\n\nA rarefied (and rarefied is even rarer) case is one where one can turn evil just by being in one place long enough. However, in this case they'll always have the world's fear to help them defeat their opponents.\n\nSome fics contain this trope. Sometimes it's implied, but sometimes it's the main character that does this, since they can turn anything they're doing Evil if it's what they want. It may be a more overt version of the Anti-Hero.\n\nOne very common reason for all of these to become True Companions is that there's a Story Arc where the main character has \"turned evil,\" or some variation of \"decided to go evil.\" When this happens, no matter how good the guy usually is in life, he is inevitably doomed by this twist to do something he shouldn't (the Anti-Villain will either lose touch with reality, or become a completely separate person, often just a different person's best friend). If it's implied, it's usually Played for Drama.

{"id":433,"ended":false,"length":728,"gen_text":"Humanity is long gone, but a surprising legacy is left behind \u2013 the great humanistic idea of freedom to live and work as one chooses\n\nThe fact is that most countries cannot afford a universal basic income for their citizens, and that in several, it would actually be a disincentive to work.\n\nIn the US, for instance, a basic income of $1,200 a month would lead to a loss of 3% of earnings. This would be a significant reduction for many, and could seriously hinder our efforts to raise living standards. There are a variety of reasons for this, but for instance, we are simply not spending enough on the welfare state:\n\nIt is now more than 40 years since the introduction of welfare in Germany, and in the US, nearly $13 trillion is spent on welfare each year \u2013 the largest social welfare and social security budget in the world, and well over one-third of the federal budget. This massive cash transfer transfers money from taxpayers to those who can least afford it. It has also become obvious that the money we spend on welfare is not keeping people from being lazy, but instead from being able to pay for basic needs. The most striking example is the fact that, in the 2000s (the latest data available), there were fewer than one million \"working poor\", who receive the minimum wage and are dependent on the state because they do not work at all. At the same time, more than six million American families receive food stamp benefits. What is this money for?\n\nIn addition, in many countries, the cost per person of providing welfare payments is the highest in Europe, but even so, welfare in this part of the world is still quite generous, considering countries in the developing world often have poverty rates of up to 90% according to the UN's Human Development Report 2015.\n\nWe can argue about the relative amount of resources needed to feed the poor (I am sympathetic to the argument raised here), but this is an extremely pressing issue that affects almost every person on earth at some point in their lives. It's also not something the richest countries can afford to leave entirely up to the individual.\n\nThis has important implications for the welfare systems of rich and poor countries. If basic income is funded by the rich nations for the benefit of all, then countries like Canada where welfare is already extremely generous and expensive can simply not afford to offer it. If a basic income funded by the rich countries is available to everyone, it would be a much more expensive solution.\n\nAs long as we keep talking about basic income, and we keep thinking about what it could mean for the world, the discussion over this idea should continue until we've reached a consensus.\n\nIn conclusion, a basic income would not remove the \"inequalities\" in society that drive people to a life of crime, or reduce violent deaths by allowing people better time to take control of their destinies. This is simply a very complicated, nuanced question that cannot be settled by a simple number, and I am sure many of you will disagree with me on some of the points below.\n\nI also encourage you to think of basic income in the context of our shared humanity, and remember that it's possible to combine a basic income with other approaches to create a much more effective system. This article is very focused on the challenges of universal support, and I do not claim to have the answer on the topic, but I believe this is a fascinating topic to explore, and something that can add value to everybody.\n\nNote: The idea for this article comes from David Brin's essay \"The Singularity is Near\".

{"id":1033,"ended":false,"length":708,"gen_text":"An old man's happiest memory comes back when he accidentally gets lost on the way home... and has to walk for several nights until he finds his family.\n\n'The people of this country cannot afford to let us go to the dogs.' - Winston Churchill\n\n\nIt's hard to think of another situation in which history is so clearly about to repeat itself. Our own generation is entering the midst of yet another global conflict that will, if war does break out again, entail the deaths of many millions of people, perhaps tens of millions. On the other side of the earth, the US and Russia are engaged in a civil war in Ukraine, the fighting with pro-Russian separatists turning increasingly bloody. Both President Obama and President Putin insist that the crisis is being manufactured by the other in order to justify further expansion of NATO and the European Union into new states in Europe, and the opening of NATO's door to Russia, to China, and to the Asian-Pacific region. Meanwhile NATO's main adversary \u2013 China \u2013is getting more aggressive, threatening India with naval bases in the South China Sea. As for nuclear weapons, the US has about as many as it had when the Berlin Wall fell. But President Obama's own plans for the near-term future, which will see a massive increase in US weapons on Russia's borders, will put the Kremlin's nuclear arsenal in violation of both the US's own and NATO's nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nIn the present tense, the past three decades have been an era of almost continuous crises, culminating in the Second Cold War, during which, if we count the post-WWII period, five world wars have been fought. It has also been an era at the beginning of which a large part of the world was largely destroyed as a result of wars and genocide. The world's largest genocidal war of all, World War II, was over by the time it officially terminated. There was little peace in Asia when it was over, and hardly any during the first decades of the peace. The last twenty years have not been kind to either East or West, the former ruled by brutal communist revolutionaries and the latter by capitalist autocrats.\n\nWhen you consider all this history, one can see why a major military action by either side to put down tensions is so profoundly frightening. But if the world's nuclear stockpiles persist as now, we simply won't be able to solve the crises posed by either Moscow, Beijing, or Washington. We'll see endless wars, mass death, destruction, and destruction. We owe it to our children and our grandchildren and to ourselves, to understand how our own actions today may determine the fate of this or that country's future, perhaps even the fate of the entire world.\n\nIf we don't, the consequences look likely to be disastrous \u2013 wars that will take generations to end, civil wars that no one can predict how to end, and new wars that in the end may not end at all. These may be the consequences for which history's \"great men of science and history\"\u2014and they are men in search of meaning, as well as in search of success\u2014have been waiting for thousands of years.\n\nJohn Dower and James Koutroulakis\n\nJohn Dower is a professor of history at Harvard University, and the author of The Accidental Superpower: The History of the Cold War, 1945-1991.

{"id":3864,"ended":false,"length":727,"gen_text":"Time travel was invented just a few years ago, and your elementary school is one of the first schools to get their hands on one of these machines. Today is `` Bring your future-self to school '' day.\n\nIn fact, in the year 2000, the first school will be hosting a special space trip. In this special program, the class will be invited to a party that's supposed to include a ride through space into the near future. Then after graduation, we are supposed to all get a chance to go to space.\n\nSpace travel is about much more than just giving people the chance to visit the moon and the stars. We have all been promised that with the use of these machines, we will be able to visit our space ancestors and find out what they were doing with their lives before we came along.\n\nHere are two interesting examples of a classroom activity that can be done with these machines.\n\nThe Classroom Activity\n\nIn recent years, schools have been taking astronomy and history classes much more seriously. They have to because so many people have been taken to space, and so some of the teachers have decided to use their astronomy and history classes in this way.\n\nIf your school is not using a dedicated science or history class, you can encourage them to have kids help out by playing a little astronomy. Some teachers might decide to play this with their kids (and parents) before they get on the airplane, then go on the trip. You can go this way too. Just make sure the kids know the answers before they embark upon their adventure, and that the game is safe enough for them to participate.\n\nHere are two different groups of kids enjoying the game.\n\nOnce in your classroom, have the students find the answer using one of these machines.\n\nIf this doesn't work, there are a number of alternative methods you can use. You can simply have each kid try to do the math before they begin playing. If this works, then you can take the kids out over a camping or other out-of-the-way location with lots of lights, and have them start their game using candlelight.\n\nThis means they will have to get some use out of their fingers, but they will avoid any of the danger of having to open up the door of the capsule.\n\nThere is one other possibility. The students can get some sort of activity activity involved in the game. For instance, a science project that's related to the trip to space. The kids can work together to invent some new device to help with the trip. This is an activity that has been popular this past year with science experiments that use the Space Shuttle.\n\nOne of those experiments that NASA has used is a camera that records video. One of the kids has a camera that can record video from within the capsule (not so much from outside where you might want it). This camera has been used several times, and most of the students are familiar with the basic concept of recording video from inside a capsule. It would be really fun if the kids had to test out different ideas for new hardware that helped in their space travel. It would add to their excitement, learn a lot about electronics in general, and would help with their communication skills.\n\nAt the end of the day, your job as a teacher is to give the kids a chance to experience something new. So, don't be scared to let them enjoy the experience. Remember that they are only kids. Don't try to restrict them! And also remember to respect the group of kids that has been invited to this very special event with you.\n\nI hope that your teacher would enjoy playing this machine with the class.

{"id":2024,"ended":false,"length":691,"gen_text":"Going about your daily routine in Heaven, you stumble across an asylum seeker from Hell.\n\nHell is a terrifying place where people live in fear and despair.\n\nThey're in solitary confinement, stripped from any contact with the outside world.\n\nThey're forced to sit quietly as they watch the other inmates die while they stay alive.\n\nThere's no time for anything. The only way to go on is to die fighting, or at least giving life trying.\n\nWhen you're in Purgatory, you have no choice. It's a place of punishment.\n\nYou can have a family or a good job, but if you do, you'll suffer excruciating pain. If you do not have a family or a job, you suffer excruciating pain.\n\nNo one is trying to kill anyone, but they can. There's really no escape, no help, nothing.\n\nWe are, however, in a very different place.\n\nPeople have made some of the most astounding discoveries in the history of science.\n\nIt wasn't long before the church was forced to admit that Hell was not just a place of torment for those that broke their promises, but a living, breathing planet, one that exists in many different forms which we currently can only imagine.\n\nThe otherworldly reality that we experience on Earth has been the subject of much research.\n\nWe've discovered that the sun is a giant planet located 1.5 million light years away, and Jupiter is a gas giant located around 7 million light years away.\n\nWe've discovered the dark space that separates the galaxies, and that our planet is a discoloured point in space.\n\nWe've calculated that there are millions of galaxies far, far away, which may contain planets that have never even been seen by us.\n\nWe've learnt that we are one part of something far greater than us, something almost incomprehensible.\n\nMost people's first reaction upon hearing of this was that this is just another story we could tell people in order to help them get through the day until the next one.\n\nBut perhaps there is more to it than just that.\n\nI've heard many people say that they thought about their beliefs but found them unbearably heavy.\n\nEven so, for some people, they just couldn't stop thinking about it.\n\nCould there really be any kind of hope of changing their religious beliefs?\n\nWell, it turns out that some of these beliefs were not made to be changed.\n\nBut maybe there is one tiny chance that we have that these beliefs of yours, which you've grown comfortable with and even embraced, are actually wrong.\n\nMaybe we can persuade you not to believe the things that you do because we've also been taught to look for them, and that's exactly what this site is for.\n\nNow, let's get on with it!\n\nIt's time for you to begin questioning your very soul.\n\nIt's time to look inside yourself and ask yourself questions such as:\n\nHave I put myself in situations where I have been able to influence events to move in a direction that was completely undesired?\n\nHave I been the cause of harm to others through my choices?\n\nHave I been the cause of harm to myself through my thoughts and actions?\n\nIf these are the case, then how can

{"id":4750,"ended":true,"length":749,"gen_text":"You can either live as long as you want, or you can have children. Not both.\n\n\"It was in the year 2000 that I first began to realize that men were no longer able to make such claims about marriage, although we had known for many years in our culture men were capable of being married,\" wrote the feminist feminist author Julia Serano. [ 5 ] Nowhere did Serano ever mention man-made, and that's because she's correct. According to the American Academy, \"no social science research has ever demonstrated a relationship between the death of a man who was child-bearing and the collapse of the society for which he was responsible. In fact, such a relationship has been found for thousands of suicides by women.\" [ 6 ] Even if one accepts Serano's interpretation, her claim is demonstrably refuted by several other recent studies that found the opposite, that the death of a man who left his family to marry someone else created an atmosphere which fostered crime, disease, and divorce for all his children. This doesn't mean men cannot make such claims, of course. It's not some magical law, like the laws of thermodynamics or relativity that have never been proven. But it shows the absurdity of such assertions. When a male, who believes he can leave his family to marry someone else is later found to be pregnant, there are the two ways to treat the claim: 1. He's the victim of a deception perpetrated by an otherwise decent woman who is desperate to find a husband that will look like the kind of man she can't have, and 2. He was a good father - he just went and did something crazy. He can continue to blame his misfortunes on his wife at dinner conversations; he can continue to blame her for the fact that he didn't think of the kids in any meaningful way. He can also continue to blame those whom he doesn't know for ruining what she started out with. There is little point in attempting to make it about his mother, who is dead, because he has no real sympathy; there's no reason he should look at how his father felt about being a single father, especially since he doesn't know what that's like. There's also no point in denying that he was a good father, he simply cannot bear to be in the same room with his wife, if the world's foremost advocate of sexual freedom is to be believed -- even in death.In the real world, with enough of them, \"no\" is a real answer. A wife knows that her husband isn't capable of fulfilling his family responsibilities on his own, and so she can simply walk out the door. One woman even told a court that when her husband told her to \"leave, you leave\" there was no indication she was pregnant at the time; in reality, her husband was probably just trying to get out of paying child support, but no one would be able to tell because no one there believed in the \"no birth control\" laws.There may be an increasing number of men who will no longer be able to raise their children (including men in abusive situations), but as with any gender issue, there will always be some of those men who are capable of making choices that would be appropriate in a different world (or universe). Sooner or later, most fathers will realize that in order to deal with the consequences of their own family shortcomings they may need to leave the family. It's the only way to stop the cycle that leads to divorce - and with it, child endangerment and criminality as well as the breakdown of family groups that will never have been the same. The best way for men to prevent themselves from making the decision to leave their family is by recognizing that they won't have the same choices elsewhere.","token_len":765,"entropy":[1.4889,5.4328,7.0054,4.7248,4.5,0.0716,0.3752,0.6829,1.0457,0.5186,0.8465,0.0478,4.9021,3.3903,1.3859,6.0621,2.92,0.7277,1.4578,0.0049,2.9868,2.8184,3.0389,5.2772,1.2026,5.8656,1.6792,0.7808,0.9863,3.1717,3.5385,0.4546,3.1937,0.4763,5.2237,2.2085,3.7077,0.2059,4.0163,0.0228,4.1332,3.3421,5.9334,2.6162,5.1876,2.2181,5.8067,3.6006,1.6497,3.0215,1.1144,2.4613,0.4464,5.9251,1.7888,1.8467,6.1211,1.5085,3.1746,0.0196,3.3293,2.2723,2.2335,3.4578,2.7563,3.3122,4.4576,2.4602,5.1242,0.0953,0.0087,1.1631,7.274,8.5498,0.4073,7.626,2.812,2.7828,0.8448,0.0002,3.297,1.6947,6.8228,0.8878,1.4811,3.4784,3.6359,3.981,1.8893,1.5393,0.8792,2.7179,4.8485,0.4608,4.246,0.0059,1.378,3.6438,2.4835,7.1678,1.8455,4.928,4.0275,2.5253,1.4991,0.9036,0.7408,2.297,2.0322,3.2481,0.0332,1.6183,5.2807,0.5921,0.61,2.0642,4.2657,2.0413,4.5539,3.6331,0.8702,2.5957,0.4117,5.7547,0.0128,1.0594,2.8005,5.4227,0.1262,0.1476,0.6466,0.5179,2.2359,2.3404,0.5651,0.066,4.0445,0.3702,0.418,1.3028,2.4873,1.4972,2.695,5.5811,0.0171,5.8321,3.2563,2.2523,0.9331,0.9395,0.5691,0.0383,4.9086,2.3056,3.3086,2.6527,2.657,0.001,0.0444,4.7207,1.0093,3.4521,2.5397,1.0788,4.0063,0.0117,7.5218,0.1242,4.7631,2.7054,5.1051,0.3598,3.2401,3.1249,2.2941,0.6228,2.8532,1.2462,2.196,1.9366,0.0195,0.3561,1.2943,0.7015,5.5501,1.3693,1.4189,1.0194,2.6858,4.8746,0.3132,5.4801,2.518,4.6213,3.8435,4.2628,0.0053,4.7144,1.3095,4.5287,0.3424,0.3464,4.6797,4.1372,3.6212,2.7279,1.0683,0.4582,4.4212,4.5181,0.0008,0.786,2.8064,2.9024,2.2882,0.7497,0.2656,0.7627,2.6936,0.0008,1.0707,2.0666,2.3071,3.4974,5.7824,5.0637,2.6788,3.3844,2.1474,1.315,2.2854,0.0572,1.1575,0.0015,2.1355,2.818,2.9205,4.8452,2.6364,0.0972,1.7226,1.1696,1.7995,1.324,4.8204,2.6604,3.0812,0.1106,3.0905,3.4072,0.6808,5.3645,1.9157,4.984,4.4371,2.2883,6.0757,1.0303,1.6602,4.2133,0.1711,0.2215,0.7863,0.5776,1.5043,0.1279,5.8705,4.9622,0.9159,1.6117,1.1599,4.0946,0.5425,3.6754,1.9764,5.0686,4.0095,6.1238,1.959,5.5869,1.588,6.479,0.9401,1.6862,1.1026,2.4522,2.1603,3.9742,0.9216,0.1134,1.1949,4.6335,2.626,0.2077,3.4839,5.8043,2.7202,2.0471,1.4085,2.6006,3.5973,0.3647,3.1507,0.2382,1.0761,5.8014,0.8619,4.8842,3.076,1.7445,3.4683,0.0513,0.5477,0.2625,3.383,1.2847,0.6242,1.5432,0.9543,1.0735,0.0173,0.6027,2.6472,2.7368,3.2781,0.964,5.9892,2.1336,2.5591,4.6703,2.5705,2.5173,0.7542,4.5906,1.0022,4.574,3.6155,5.7205,0.273,3.3369,1.3133,5.2146,0.6157,0.0552,0.0007,0.0721,1.4875,1.2973,6.4605,7.2926,6.1937,4.894,1.2492,0.1728,2.0848,0.0604,1.8493,2.5351,0.578,1.9092,1.9455,0.1628,0.3909,3.8535,0.0007,4.9437,1.9398,2.1411,3.9407,3.4905,5.1616,2.2263,0.1245,1.6842,1.7252,0.2043,3.1534,1.3147,0.0595,0.9317,7.0296,5.3308,0.1317,4.6169,0.0005,1.7109,2.2205,4.3872,4.7053,5.5711,3.2593,4.8869,1.1088,0.4457,4.1489,1.1615,4.9006,2.2413,0.3679,4.8017,0.0601,3.534,4.1846,3.4785,2.9876,4.5306,0.9084,1.9326,2.159,2.9642,1.1424,2.0247,2.2055,2.7208,0.4559,3.6511,4.9587,7.1468,2.2487,1.5409,0.847,2.6339,4.319,0.7731,4.8845,1.334,5.1227,1.2883,1.8879,5.4267,1.0601,4.0449,0.72,1.6002,0.5184,1.1829,5.1558,1.2691,0.7598,2.9214,0.0007,0.9595,2.1945,2.3161,1.9443,0.034,0.3632,3.1067,0.9505,1.792,0.5686,0.4337,0.2629,5.1269,0.9012,1.1388,1.9693,0.7393,0.2999,0.1157,0.924,4.6077,4.3931,5.1177,3.8451,0.6573,2.8998,3.2152,0.4148,0.5817,0.0745,0.7397,0.6736,2.5091,1.4461,5.5365,3.7049,5.5971,2.6728,4.5033,4.2842,0.3934,5.5372,1.5883,1.6039,2.8924,0.2355,0.2766,7.9658,2.7546,3.7354,3.5813,0.6221,4.7043,1.634,5.2305,0.0171,0.1246,6.0892,6.3166,4.7761,3.3999,0.1902,5.1684,3.503,2.8641,0.9567,1.7336,2.9851,1.1954,0.3949,3.9145,5.7081,6.0415,1.5622,1.8197,0.297,4.1675,0.0007,2.7024,0.0245,3.9243,1.1092,3.8651,1.9322,4.5618,0.246,0.0054,0.8547,0.7729,2.673,0.5167,3.7116,4.4843,2.957,0.6624,1.5936,0.0644,1.66,5.4233,3.4966,3.8309,3.5106,2.0126,2.3863,0.6249,3.454,0.7647,0.1963,3.4799,0.0264,3.1615,2.5276,2.9769,2.5172,2.7141,1.3166,2.0717,5.3606,0.3699,0.7628,5.5349,2.7561,1.1887,3.8208,3.3469,0.491,0.015,3.3779,3.1907,2.953,0.1904,3.3611,0.6331,1.0711,4.5606,2.2276,1.5112,0.0086,1.7735,1.925,0.1484,2.4013,0.2128,0.0098,1.8995,2.2847,4.7126,1.0655,1.783,2.772,2.75,0.0049,1.0042,2.6378,3.0288,0.2081,6.507,3.9602,3.4852,1.3111,2.8817,2.0517,4.4968,0.2413,0.2935,2.6941,0.9369,4.6939,5.0465,0.2775,3.8775,5.7639,0.3184,0.0124,1.3804,0.4342,3.5259,4.3163,0.0397,1.3352,0.3265,0.0062,5.1924,0.8944,0.5549,5.1636,5.7625,3.9282,3.5532,2.5397,2.629,0.9516,0.335,4.0101,3.5419,2.2051,4.974,1.8027,0.245,1.7665,1.6149,0.3225,0.0115,2.3636,4.8756,1.51,1.0907,0.2881,2.3339,2.6836,0.3155,4.0165,5.9131,1.5184,3.5458,2.0688,4.9564,2.1385,1.5953,2.5531,2.5115,4.6581,2.4189,5.7331,0.7658,4.4442,4.7221,0.0094,0.0011,0.244,3.2796,5.0984,0.7258,2.429,0.5133,5.0276,1.8993,0.1001,5.9951,0.0439,0.8215,3.1864,0.0551,0.9157,2.4024,6.9829,6.0491,2.8833,3.9073,1.1562,0.0582,2.1001,1.5036,0.8476,2.3387,2.8578,0.7802,3.2647,2.3895,0.3979,0.6276,4.3846,0.906,1.106,4.5025,2.6477,0.2453,1.9599,5.162,1.4307,4.3733,1.6204,0.442,4.0753,5.3,0.0005,1.3767,5.6718,5.0635,0.5

{"id":419,"ended":false,"length":732,"gen_text":"A little girl becomes pen pals with a minor cosmic horror. What are their conversations like? What are their dreams? What is the girl's name? And what is the boy's name?\n\nThis book would have also been interesting if it had actually been a story about what it would be like to have children, rather than a story about childhood. This book could have been interesting and fun if it had been about a little boy coming home from school where he got picked on and bullied by others. This book could have been interesting if we knew that the two main characters were actually both aliens that had their own home planet on Earth and came here to study the human children. This book could have been interesting if we know that the girl's name was Nellie and that she has a brother called Peter. It could have also been fun if the aliens lived in the school, and the books were about the kids and school, rather than the aliens living inside the school.\n\nHowever, I'm afraid that all of those potential scenarios were lost in the writing. The writing and the character development for this novel were awful.\n\n\nThere are two main characters in this novel (we learn they are aliens living inside the school, instead of aliens living outside of the school ), so we are already stuck with two main characters. But then we also learn that there are other alien children and alien aliens living in Earth, and there is no way that we would let them live in that school as they had grown up in that school. What are the odds for two alien children and alien aliens living in the very school that they grew up in? What are the odds for them to also be classmates in the same grade, but with different cultures and different ways of communicating? What are the odds for them to have different friends on the other planet where they were raised?\n\nThe writing is horrible.\n\nThe writing was horrible!\n\nThe writing was terrible!\n\nThe writing was terrible!\n\nThese people, who you know will grow up to be good people, had their own horrible childhoods. These people who will grow up to be good people had horrible childhoods too. I am not making any of this up. There is no possible way this book could have been good had it been written by any other author. This book was just a terrible, horrible book.\n\nI am now really angry with the author because of this. I am angry that he was allowed to write this book. I am angry that this book exists. I am angry that anyone is allowed to create this book that was filled with these horrendous situations, these horrible mistakes that these characters made.\n\nYou are not allowed to create a child-starring, blockbuster-creating action novel with children as your main characters, with people that you love, and that you are allowed to create with the permission of the copyright holder! Why? This book is filled with horrible events, in the midst of a wonderful story that has nothing but friendship, friendship, friendship. It is filled with horrible mistakes, in the midst of a wonderful story that has nothing but friendship, friendship, friendship. It is filled with horrible mistakes, in the midst of a wonderful story that has nothing but friendship, friendship, friendship.\n\nYou are not allowed to create such a terrible, horrible book. Ever!\n\nI am so angry with my editor, at my publisher, at my author. This book was like something that could never be made to be made.

One example being a planet that is about to explode with Superman in it (as per Batman\/Superman).\n\nIn the DCAU's \"Superman, Darkseid, and the Legion of Super villains\", Superman, Superboy, and Supergirl are captured by Legionnaires, the most powerful villains in the universe. Despite their differences from each other and the Legionnaires' general hatred of each other, Superman (being very powerful) easily defeats them using mind control magic. His power, however, comes back (having been drained of it by Darkseid...), and he defeats them again using the same type of magic. Justified in that they were the Legionnaires' strongest foes, but it could be said as they had the worst luck that Superman had ever encountered. In the \"New 52\" reboot, Superman is shown using a device that gives him unlimited cosmic power. The Legion of Super Heroes also have a kind of this. While they are normally at the top of the food chain in the DCU, they have been recently forced out of the top position by the arrival of a mysterious new villain. He's an army of dark versions of them (or rather, his clones) and they're very powerful when fully developed. These clones include Captain Cold, Red Tornado, Black Lightning, and Power Girl, who was captured by them at one point before the original Superman saved her. The original (and most powerful) Legion of Super Heroes were sent back in time by the Justice League, specifically to stop Superboy-Prime from killing the original Superman. This proved to be a short-lived effort as after using the Legion of Super Heroes' power to manipulate the weather to make himself unstoppable, he took enough of them as \"his\" army to destroy not only Earth, but the entire Legion of Super Heroes universe. Fortunately they were on Earth after that and managed to save him from the explosion.\n\n\nFilms \u2014 Animated\n\nFilms \u2014 Live-Action\n\nLiterature\n\nLive action TV\n\nMyths & Religion\n\nThe Bible: During the battle of Gath, a godless soldier named Jephthah kills a giant with a hurled spear and uses the shaft in the shape of a cudgel, then goes against an army of God-fearing men and uses the same spear. There is plenty of humor as his enemies mock him for killing the giant, while his friends laugh at him for using a \"silly\" sword. When he gets angry, he beats the soldiers off with the spear, throws it into the temple wall, and then proceeds to rape the temple women. After this, he becomes a warrior god.\n\n\nVideo Games\n\nWeb Comics\n\nIn The Order of the Stick, Teth was once a mortal who took the form of a sword.

{"id":2257,"ended":false,"length":684,"gen_text":"You run an item shop, dealing in things such as potions, magical weaponry and armor. Describe your everyday routine.\n\nYour Shop in Dungeoneering\n\n\nIt's the day after the annual ritual of the sacrifice of the sacrifice goat, and you've come to Dungeoneering to collect the offerings made by the other Dungeoneering players for your yearly charity.\n\n\nYour shop is situated inside the Dungeoneering guild, on the main floor of the Guildhalls of course. You start the day with your usual breakfast, and then it's time to make your first sale.\n\n\nYou can have one inventory space per offering, so you need to work with your shop assistant to prepare a selection for your customers:\n\n\nIf you're still planning to donate money to the temple in the hope of some kind of reward (say, a rare item found nowhere else) then you should sell what you collect on your shop to customers.\n\n\nBefore the shops\n\nYour shop assistant will have the following items with them:\n\n\nA pot for boiling any magical potion which is to be sold - for some magical stuff, like rings of wealth, it's perfectly acceptable (and very convenient) to use the old-fashioned one-pot-of-poison for all your potions.\n\nA small box for storing anything which is to be used in the shop, and which you don't want to get thrown away.\n\n\nThe two main differences between a shop assistant as they appear in game and a real one are:\n\nMost will only be wearing one-piece outfits, with a large variety of hats, and a smaller number wearing headgear.\n\nwill only be wearing, with a. This is because you can only run the shop one time a day, and as a shop assistant is the only part which doesn't require you to be in the temple at all, the shops will automatically shut at the end of the day (there's also a \"Restart Shop\" button which you can use for the next day, if you want; but, it's not needed for this purpose).\n\nOnce your offerings have been prepared and your shop assistant has stocked your inventory with the items you're selling, you can safely leave your shop. If you're only going to give your sales for a small bonus that day, make the extra money by using the \"Discount Rune\" - you can buy up to 50% off the next sale. This will be very useful for players new to Runecrafting, who can't usually rely on the runecrafting shops for good prices - so they can simply buy the best runes they need instead!\n\n\nDonating donations\n\nAs you've brought your shop assistant (who will be wearing your outfit, and making your offerings in real life), you have now been given the choice to donate the money to the Temple of Rune - and you will usually want to, unless you can't afford it!\n\n\nSince donations to the temple (the \"donation-tokens of the temple\" are a series of gold bars, most of which are worth more than their face-value in RuneCoins) are completely optional and you don't have to donate to your favourite god, it doesn't hurt to donate when you can.

{"id":1694,"ended":false,"length":719,"gen_text":"10 years ago, scientists discovered that there is something after death. And it's bad, really really bad.\n\nIn fact, in the year since those scientists first put the word to paper, scientists have discovered that all the things that were thought to be the true'after life' have been turned on their heads.\n\nIf you think about it really hard, there's only one after life and it's nothing to see here in front of you. It's this: you die and then it's okay.\n\nDon't worry, there will be no after death, no punishment, nothing bad. There's no one to judge you for any of your bad deeds, no one to tell you what you should do or what you should not do. You simply die and then you're done. You don't live any more.\n\nThis after life is where you go from here and it is where what we call life, as we know it, dies and the afterlife comes to be. This is heaven.\n\nAs you can see, this after life is completely different from the heaven we think we know and it's just as exciting as you imagine it to be.\n\nThe most amazing thing about living in the after life is the fact that your loved ones will probably never see you alive again. Not even your own grandchildren. This after death is where you go from here and it is where what we call life, as we know it, dies and the afterlife comes to be. This is heaven.\n\nWhat will happen to us during our after-life and how will we die? If you're wondering what the after-life is like, it's really easy to imagine, as this photo I've included below will show you.\n\nThe real life after-life is simply that. We're not allowed to go any farther. The only things we can do are those things we chose beforehand. And I can almost guarantee you that there will be nobody to see you when you do it, as you will be dead before people can see you. If you want, you could even spend your time in a dark place away from all the light of the outside world.\n\nIn fact, there will be only a few people in the real life after-life. If you do what I tell you now and die right there in front of them, there's absolutely nothing anyone can do to stop you\u2026\n\nSo now you know what happens when you die. This is actually very simple. You die, people watch you die, you die and then\u2026\n\nWell, they will never see you again and so they can't care. Or at least that's what the Bible says. And God tells you exactly how you will be forgotten and that there's nothing anyone can do about it.\n\nBut we both know that's not true. We're not forgetting anything. Nobody will see us again no matter how much we wish they would. Life in the after-life, no matter how hard it becomes, is much better than dying.\n\nSo I suggest that you accept your fate. No matter how awful it is, you have to accept it. It's your life, your life is worth living.\n\nSo, when your soul leaves your body to enter the eternal heaven, remember this quote from a good friend of mine.

{"id":2521,"ended":true,"length":696,"gen_text":"As it turns out, Black Holes aren't so bad after all. Instead of a painful stretchy death, when you fly into them, this happens instead...\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" said Chris Coker, who was visiting from Virginia for Thanksgiving.\n\nCoker and his wife were looking for entertainment in a park near the park's entrance when they suddenly felt a slight pain in their back. They began to panic \u2014 and when they looked down, the light just didn't cut it.\n\n\"When I saw black holes that big it actually surprised me,\" Coker said, \"because we're used to so much light.\"\n\n\"I thought, I'm never going to see it again,\" he said, with a laugh. \"I'm pretty sure we're not the first people who found themselves in a dark place in the middle of the night trying to see the stars.\"\n\nAt 4:12 a.m., Coker and his wife decided it was time to go home.\n\nBut they weren't headed back to some darkened cave. Rather, Coker noticed what looked like a light.\n\n\"There's no light from the sun. No, not from the moon,\" Coker said, \"but clearly it's overhead.\"\n\nTo help understand the black holes, researchers have studied the brightness of the Milky Way, the constellation Perseus and other light sources.\n\nBut the dark hole at the park is too distant to get a clear picture of its light.\n\nWhen Coker pointed out that the stars near Sirius that are brighter than Venus were almost too hot to be stars, he said, the researcher at first dismissed it.\n\n\"He said, 'That can't be right, there's nothing that bright that could be there.'\"\n\nBut the observations proved true.\n\nLight isn't everywhere. It is, in fact, far more common than we thought.\n\n\"We're just not familiar with what it looks like in every place and at every time of day,\" said Brian Peebles, lead researcher on the video.\n\n\"Every once in a while we run across one that's absolutely special,\" he said.\n\nThe dark hole seen with Peebles and his group, known as S2156, is one of those.\n\nIt is about 120 light-hours away from us, yet has a brightness of about 10 billion suns. That is about as bright -- over seven million times brighter -- as the full moon.\n\n\"It's the brightness of the moon from Earth to Mars, that's it,\" said Peebles.\n\nBecause it is so far away, the black hole appears as a point of light when viewed over a period of more than two hours. Peebles also says there was enough time in the night for enough stars to be visible to our eyes.\n\n\"I would say that the stars would have been no brighter than a couple of a hundred in our atmosphere at the time,\" said Peebles.\n\nThe research that Peebles and his colleagues studied was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nCokers, whose story has been shared here, also shared his amazement in a Facebook post.\n\n\"We were flying to the park to go on a boat ride for dinner when I realized I was a) standing in the dark in my flannel, b) completely oblivious to the

{"id":206,"ended":true,"length":706,"gen_text":"A zombie outbreak has just began and they're all over your town, write me a story starting from wherever you currently are.\n\nJust one short example of what to shoot for...\n\n(Just to remind you...\n\nThis form DOES NOT REQUIRE any previous skills you may have to start a story - its all about the writing.\n\nEven though you do not need any prior writing experience to write and submit a story to us, your skill and skill in story telling will help you. However, it is not required that the story itself be written by you. This form will allow you to start a self-published story with a deadline on it for submission.\n\nSo, with this form... here's how it works:\n\n1. Choose what genre you'd like to write a story for and choose the genre of story you'd like to write. There are many different genres, and the genre you choose will help with your self promotion. We'll explain about the genre after you have submitted your story.\n\n2. Write your story. We allow for any length of story and if you feel confident doing so, please set a deadline for publication.\n\nWe encourage your story to have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Any questions, comments, or concerns (such as spelling, grammar, or other areas) can be put in the story submission email (required) - no need to include it on your story itself. (We will let you know when that's required. As always, email us with any problems, questions, or suggestions at support@chilloutmagazine.com.)\n\n3. Submit your story by email using the form on our website, or in this easy-to-read and easy-to-share pdf. If you don't have a web browser on your computer, then we suggest you download a free reader to make your life easier.\n\n*Note! Submissions of images will be taken down if they are too short. If you feel this is an issue for you, please let us know when your submission is submitted. We will take it down.\n\nOnce your submission is in, you have a 2-day deadline to submit a proof, proofed, and proofed by our submission team. If your story is not proofed and proofed before 2 days are up, it will be deleted.\n\nIf you send a submission after 2 days but before 2 days has passed, it will be deleted.\n\nAfter the submission period, you will receive an automated email that contains your story. You can also check your email for your notification email if you missed any deadline (if you have not already). Please make two note of this. First, we receive millions of stories every month - many of them are deleted. It is never our intent to make it impossible for anyone to submit to ChillOut Magazine. We want you to feel comfortable - and if you feel like we have sent you the email too soon, please let us know.\n\nThank you for your contributions to the magazine!\n\nChillOut Magazine (C.O.C.) is a print magazine dedicated to the best of DIY self publishing. The print magazine is available in 4 different sizes and will be available through the ChillOut Magazine App (available to download for iOS, Android, and Kindle in the Appstore, Google Play, Amazon), and as DRM-free PDF via CoolJunk.

{"id":291,"ended":true,"length":730,"gen_text":"Humans are more terrifying than the most advanced aliens in the galaxy... but they're more predictable.\n\nThat's the conclusion of a new study in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, which also points to another reason why humans are far more terrifying than the most advanced aliens in the galaxy: We're easier to predict.\n\nThere's no great mystery about why the most advanced aliens are likely to have been wiped out\u2014it's just human nature. But humans were actually the most likely to survive the past 10,000 years. (For more details on why this is, read How Are Aliens In Search Of A New Civilization.)\n\nThe study used data from a number of online sources to track how often various \"species\" (more on that later) and other entities like civilizations were wiped out across the history of the world. (These sources included the books The History Of Human Societies, and Who Moved My Cheese?.)\n\nThe researchers then looked into the possible factors behind these events. Based on the information in these sources, and on other factors like the length of time that a given society lasted, the researchers concluded that:\n\nHumans are far more predictable than the most advanced aliens. When it comes to which species (and other entities) will get wiped out, we already know... The most likely scenario is that human civilization is doomed by internal conflict.\n\nWhy It Happens\n\nWhen it comes to predictions about how advanced civilizations might behave, we're usually better off having a better understanding of our own behavior.\n\nThis study comes after years of speculation about the possibility that ancient human societies may have been more aggressive than we are now, and that the invention of agriculture may have fueled this idea.\n\nThis isn't to say that these hypotheses are totally wrong, but they don't explain why humans were such a far greater threat over history. In other words, there's no reason to think that when it comes to intelligence, humans will always outmatch aliens.\n\nIn any case, the way that humans behave when it comes to warfare isn't particularly alien. Humans have engaged in war almost continuously throughout history, from the time of our common ancestors right up to the present. The difference here is that modern wars generally occur between nations who are technologically advanced yet still far from the galactic horizon. Ancient warfare was essentially between civilizations who both knew more about weapons than we do.\n\nThese findings, then, imply that some of the factors that predict whether humans will be wiped out may have little long-term relevance when it comes to predicting the outcome of more ancient conflicts. Instead, it seems that human nature really is a factor here.\n\nThere's actually an interesting caveat that the authors of the article include: It also suggests \"the presence of larger entities, such as civilizations, which could influence the outcome of the violent conflict,\" including humans\u2014since a more destructive outcome tends to be the one by which larger systems like civilizations are judged. (This is similar to the \"more powerful than bacteria theory\" that scientists have recently begun discussing as an indicator of intelligent behavior.)\n\nSo while it would be nice to have a completely \"clean\" explanation for the emergence of warfare in human history, it doesn't seem likely that this will be the case.\n\nUltimately, the research also makes plain the fact that we are very much like our extraterrestrials. (The only difference is that aliens tend to be even more terrifying.)\n\nIn essence, the vast majority of humans who died in past conflicts are likely to still have some impact on our civilization. In other words, our planet may not even have the potential for another massive extinction event in the future. What will it take to wipe us out? It will probably require us to make war for many more years.","token_len":772,"entropy":[0.203,1.4371,4.4065,10.2114,0.5237,2.7151,3.5856,4.9441,4.176,2.4616,0.8389,1.5844,5.3456,3.2395,1.9924,1.1136,4.18,3.8968,1.4452,1.3767,0.0146,4.2436,0.467,1.2793,1.5176,0.4563,0.5582,0.499,0.4404,3.0919,5.7813,0.0173,0.1986,0.0012,0.0145,0.8883,0.5144,5.468,4.5329,0.868,3.152,2.9428,0.9188,1.9611,0.6595,4.902,0.3354,1.7177,0.1917,1.7352,0.3426,0.1268,0.3234,0.2545,0.0386,0.0604,0.491,1.4885,0.6535,5.0992,0.0308,0.6597,0.2682,0.1322,0.0003,5.9383,0.9057,2.5971,6.1995,0.2191,1.3775,0.47,3.2528,2.2585,0.616,0.5784,1.4955,3.722,0.0426,3.2958,3.5637,1.6788,0.0364,5.3101,2.3617,0.1051,2.4936,5.1517,0.1256,0.5874,2.1317,2.5981,5.4728,4.9141,2.2383,1.6791,1.4963,1.0196,1.5648,1.0376,5.3491,1.5621,0.0631,0.0077,0.0437,1.7015,3.9604,4.4135,2.0611,3.8537,1.2611,1.9283,2.5015,0.3769,0.4338,1.8659,5.406,5.8643,1.221,4.9765,4.309,0.0792,2.0807,0.5464,5.3565,5.5249,0.0498,0.0003,1.7961,1.1007,3.548,1.2778,0.2888,2.1308,4.0413,0.0045,5.6085,2.9777,1.3274,2.9901,2.0655,1.6606,2.5347,4.2987,3.956,0.2059,2.8513,5.8336,0.6453,0.6358,1.4567,0.0241,3.9057,3.3358,3.5282,3.7085,4.2957,2.723,3.8234,0.0239,3.7787,1.1856,1.438,0.0043,0.7002,2.2936,0.225,2.2949,4.5589,3.0783,1.1814,1.4884,5.3443,2.0326,3.0897,2.9218,3.0375,1.4768,0.0014,1.007,3.2953,5.2062,3.4834,0.9794,0.0691,0.0554,1.3021,1.2894,0.4571,0.0002,1.45,1.1215,1.3589,2.1755,4.5556,1.2688,4.75,2.7565,2.1542,2.2702,1.8779,1.2145,5.5724,0.0223,1.5601,3.3087,3.0272,0.5782,0.5467,0.0921,3.7646,2.7795,3.1204,2.3535,0.5475,1.3161,4.9517,0.0409,0.4297,2.0089,2.2092,2.4404,2.8777,1.7451,0.2964,0.7204,0.3482,2.5262,0.07,2.599,0.0717,0.0003,1.2599,0.0015,0.8165,2.7777,0.1403,1.3829,0.1352,1.3558,0.1102,0.0144,0.262,1.5466,5.5078,1.9492,0.0804,0.0173,5.3314,0.3545,5.3086,2.0105,1.4965,0.1714,0.2656,1.9725,4.3905,0.0754,0.0424,0.7026,1.654,4.5144,0.3106,5.5415,4.2528,1.7984,1.3969,3.3767,0.5061,0.5412,3.5804,1.9527,2.4005,2.2457,3.7424,4.2335,1.0684,1.0846,1.0674,0.0002,4.6647,5.3483,5.0002,0.3106,0.2215,0.0003,3.4395,1.3253,0.0173,0.0218,5.1025,1.0911,2.7161,4.049,2.6337,2.1781,0.8036,0.1059,2.3458,1.482,3.4619,3.8661,0.3941,5.5443,1.1738,3.6534,0.6125,0.0523,2.7717,0.3118,0.9214,0.6608,1.3145,0.0002,2.8691,3.2847,4.9386,3.9927,3.9942,0.0234,2.45,0.7591,1.4652,2.3355,1.2335,5.2794,3.353,1.5347,2.4196,0.2125,0.8007,1.8139,3.2563,0.5019,0.6605,4.3158,2.7086,1.7754,1.2408,0.8236,2.5258,5.7693,0.0091,0.8542,1.2105,0.0897,5.8704,1.6602,5.2584,0.1351,0.6467,0.0002,3.3745,3.9796,0.0004,1.7249,0.0661,0.1506,3.8476,4.2397,0.5368,3.5882,1.1159,1.468,0.6923,1.4009,2.107,0.0004,1.489,0.5757,2.0416,2.137,4.0537,0.3727,4.2734,2.5341,0.2968,5.7231,4.9573,0.924,3.7936,2.5445,0.007,0.0374,3.2812,0.6587,1.4054,1.7319,0.3236,0.7155,0.2933,4.7652,1.6365,0.1442,0.0124,5.3771,0.3618,1.8865,2.9771,0.8561,2.2375,2.7649,1.4847,0.3803,0.2462,0.0002,2.9579,3.8908,0.0751,0.0073,1.2171,6.1861,1.5516,1.0394,2.786,4.4424,1.9504,0.0265,0.0035,2.7389,3.6499,0.0004,3.7107,6.1151,1.1773,2.7981,1.1529,4.4793,0.0112,2.1524,5.7918,1.983,1.7106,0.5879,0.69,2.1551,0.6595,3.2909,0.3559,3.1764,4.4837,0.8065,4.3102,0.1361,0.4202,0.498,0.5566,1.0719,3.5294,3.5374,2.879,0.1434,0.0954,4.1127,3.5104,5.2341,3.5562,1.5999,2.4485,5.993,0.9626,3.1611,1.822,8.2387,2.4029,3.5212,0.8517,3.2459,4.6672,4.9335,0.3291,4.8995,1.8607,1.273,4.9518,1.7561,1.7843,1.9176,4.4857,3.2665,3.7658,0.9063,3.2449,1.5055,1.3773,0.1438,1.7466,0.2632,0.0002,5.0399,2.7849,3.8498,0.9857,0.0037,4.9032,0.0922,5.6565,1.3995,0.3519,3.2824,0.4428,4.258,2.6349,2.7483,0.4547,1.9953,0.5106,0.0095,2.8294,2.6865,3.0768,8.12,0.0757,0.0133,1.4194,4.2894,0.1878,0.0029,0.0042,0.8972,1.6258,3.4246,0.0195,5.8841,4.2773,1.1792,0.1548,4.8103,0.0313,1.7453,1.6238,0.5873,3.4581,1.5919,5.3606,0.6787,2.6036,2.797,2.0509,0.5174,0.375,0.0002,4.7792,0.6572,4.854,2.9279,1.3208,4.053,3.7669,2.1637,2.3019,1.2731,0.3676,5.3737,4.0097,1.8866,2.811,5.1902,1.1256,7.0306,2.5735,5.3694,0.0636,5.9264,4.8661,2.1767,0.8787,0.0033,1.6298,0.6064,2.6716,2.7857,3.8866,0.8089,1.5761,0.1757,2.1503,5.7196,2.0749,3.6764,5.5572,5.3113,5.4372,5.2425,4.6045,3.3107,5.8674,3.0008,4.7586,0.007,1.51,2.9251,4.372,6.5062,0.0786,2.4583,6.6289,3.3969,0.2943,0.8501,2.8614,0.2184,2.4438,3.6157,1.1382,3.2154,0.0327,0.7439,3.1821,4.4572,2.2201,1.4544,3.445,4.3885,0.4971,1.4925,4.6536,0.7993,2.9438,3.2135,4.7668,3.3239,2.3267,8.1353,0.2398,3.4916,1.8835,0.2956,0.0875,0.0002,2.8937,2.7306,1.9117,3.7452,0.519,1.9243,0.3483,2.1079,0.9989,4.7414,4.5905,5.2026,0.9889,0.7092,0.297,2.347,5.4911,0.0579,2.6983,1.637,0.8516,0.1966,0.0896,1.2061,3.1904,0.0003,0.6698,2.0905,0.583,2.234,1.5857,1.1319,0.3155,0.0903,0.2913,1.1433,0.0002,5.5234,0.0253,1.5351,3.8944,3.5259,3.925,6.9364,1.4956,1.7721,0.0053,1.743,2.7806,3.6273,1.5185,1.2843,2.1152,4.5236,2.9294,0.014,0.0056,1.1473,4.5911,3.4286,3.4166,0.8266,0.6202,0.1161,2.4012,2.4926,0.0637,0.8894,5.6497,0.2803,1.9899,0.8099,0.9187,0.0002,3.995,5.739,0.0247,1.8675,5.9006,0.1496,0.0051,2.7381,4.2121,5.2245,1.071,3.5057,0.7936,2.9659,2.4155,0.2079,4.

{"id":4001,"ended":false,"length":693,"gen_text":"Link dies from a flock of chickens before reaching the last dungeon to save Zelda. Who is chosen to take his place? What happens next?\n\nTHE TIE IS LOST\n\nThe first thing that we do need to do is to make a tie for the top spot.\n\nZelda and Link are the two most important characters of the game. Link is the playable main character and Zelda is the only one other than Link. The only other main character in the game is Impa and this is where I have seen people disagree. So here it is...\n\nZelda (Link)\n\nFor people who don't know, Zelda is Link's arch-nemesis. She is a Sheikah, a race of beings that live in the sacred labyrinths beneath the Triforce. Although the Sheikah have no known weaknesses, Zelda is a very powerful and competent fighter. Zeldas and Sheikahs have a very similar, yet not identical, fighting styles.\n\nZelda, like Link, wields three different types of swords. Her most used is the Master Sword which is a blade that not only shoots magical electricity, lightning, and heat, but it is also able to slice enemies into countless pieces with the cutting edge. During the entire game, Link also wields a greatsword and a short bow.\n\nThe Sheikah are similar to the Zora and they worship the Triforce as a mother god. It makes perfect sense because if a woman takes the Triforce she gives birth to a child with the same power. Therefore, if she died, so too would her child if it survived, and if Zelda died, so too would her child.\n\nTherefore, I feel that Zelda is the better character, considering she was the true mother of both Link and Impa.\n\nZelda's Story\n\nShe will be told the story by her mother, Impa. I can almost guarantee that after this point she will become one with the Triforce, as she will be born into its protection.\n\nShe will then help Zelda defeat Ganon.\n\nLink's Story\n\nYou can't save Zelda once you make her fight. So we won't see Zelda fighting, but rather Link. There will be a point where he goes out of the dungeons to save Zelda and she stays with him on the world map.\n\nI feel that this is probably the more interesting of the two tales. Both Link and Zelda, although they are strong characters, are very kind and are very kind to each other. Unlike Zelda, Link has been through so much and knows what it means to be strong without the Triforce.\n\nYou can read all of the theories and analysis right here (except for the final conclusion where you vote on who you think will \"win\")\n\nAlso, thanks to Toph for writing this fan-made video that shows off Zelda and Link in a way no game has before in the Zelda series!\n\nZelda vs Link\n\nThis is my personal theory as well, but I wanted to share it here as well.\n\nA lot of people think Zelda is not strong enough to defeat Link. The problem is, although Zelda is a good and powerful fighter, she lacks the experience to face a strong fighter. She can use any weapon in order to fight, however, she's only trained with a sword for the most part. And not being trained with the power of the power, she cannot beat Link.

{"id":2586,"ended":false,"length":692,"gen_text":"You are having a lucid dream about someone you love who has passed. S\/he tries to convince you to stay asleep with them forever. You are awake in that dream and realize that they are not real. You realize how much you have loved and loved and loved him\/her and still want to keep them alive in your dream.\n\n7. An important life decision that you have made and realized during or after a dream. If dreamer is a man, the dreamer will realize he has to choose between a woman and another man, and the dreamer tries to convince him to pick one of the options. The dreamer doesn't pick and he realizes that there were actually two possibilities and he wanted to see which one the dreamer picked.\n\n(I bet you know what a dreamer trying to convince another dreamer in a dream makes out of the dream! In case you didn't, the dream is often a representation of what will happen in real life.)\n\n8. Other common examples\n\nPeople have made some of the other 9 types of dreams more popular, or even coined these types of dreams. Here are some examples:\n\n9. Questions from Dreams\n\nOther dream-related questions you might be asking yourself when you wake up might give you some ideas about what was going on during your dream.\n\nTry asking these five questions:\n\n1. What was the theme of your dream? (The dream may have a theme that is clear in the dream but it could be unclear as to how the dream was going to finish or how it connected to real-life problems.)\n\n2. Do you remember if the dream happened in a dream? (Dwell on what the dream represented - in this case, if your dream was about a man dying in real life, what was your reaction when your dad called?)\n\n3. Did you feel like you had to make a choice for something? (Were you faced with two options, one that was bad for you and another that seemed good? Was this feeling related to whether or not you had picked the wrong option?)\n\n4. What did your dream symbolize? (Was the idea in your dream a good or bad idea?)\n\n5. What do you feel you have to do in your waking life to get out of this kind of dream?\n\nThe answers to these five questions will help you to answer the questions of your dream.\n\nIf you have had multiple dream-related questions from your dreams, you may need some more help to answer this question.\n\nI think it is worth mentioning that if your dream is about real-life events, then these questions may not apply. Usually, only the questions about your dream should be addressed.\n\nSo, What Would Happen if You Ask These Questions?\n\nIf you asked someone these questions, he\/she would probably tell you that the answer would be that no one knows and you will have to wait for your dreams in the future to know.\n\nWell, I think that is a good thing. It means that whatever happened in your dreaming, you will have to wait for the dream to tell you.\n\nI also think it is worth mentioning that no one has come up with the names of the 9 types of dreams (or at least not to my knowledge).

{"id":1831,"ended":true,"length":708,"gen_text":"Tell us about a wounded\/abandoned hero's last stand. Make us feel... guilty?\n\nHave you been in touch with any of the surviving men?\n\nThe wounded\/abandoned hero should never be forgotten.\n\nCan you give us details of a time and place?\n\nWe met up with three guys right outside the restaurant after we had stopped the guys.\n\nWhat were they doing and how were they wounded?\n\nI couldn't tell you exactly, but they were talking about how it was pretty quiet outside, and one thing led to another and I think they knew they had killed enough guys to go home with a nice bullet wound or two.\n\n(I later discovered via Google Earth that the guys were in another neighborhood, and probably in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it's really the sort of thing that never stops being fun to think about, and there's a fine line between morbid interest and making people feel weirdly guilty for having it.)\n\nWho was the oldest in the group?\n\nI think James from the trucking company, probably around 40.\n\nAnd what was his last name?\n\nHe was the oldest, and he had some issues: alcoholism, drug abuse, etc.\n\nI think I went out looking for him, so I wouldn't go by name: he always called me Jimmy.\n\nHe had a wife and two kids, and that's as far as he went in that direction.\n\n(Although I will note that he was never known as an alcoholic; it's a very specific word and can only be used by people you're close to.)\n\nWhere should we go at dinner?\n\nMy place in the woods.\n\nWhat do you think of the word 'honorable'? And why does it seem to provoke that sort of reaction?\n\nIt was what the guys were calling it; it's sort of like when you hear about guys going AWOL during WWI. They thought it was something that had to be honored.\n\nIf I could wave something away, would it be the fact that I'm getting tired of trying to remember the names of people? Or is it my responsibility to keep a detailed account of those who've been involved in important matters and try to keep a record of them?\n\nIt's hard to say.\n\nIf I die today, what happens to these guys who, by the time I get to them, won't believe that they were part of something like that? Is it fair for them to ask that question? Is it a good question?

Make us feel... guilty?\n\nHave you been in touch with any of the surviving men?\n\nThe wounded\/abandoned hero should never be forgotten.\n\nCan you give us details of a time and place?\n\nWe met up with three guys right outside the restaurant after we had stopped the guys.\n\nWhat were they doing and how were they wounded?\n\nI couldn't tell you exactly, but they were talking about how it was pretty quiet outside, and one thing led to another and I think they knew they had killed enough guys to go home with a nice bullet wound or two.\n\n(I later discovered via Google Earth that the guys were in another neighborhood, and probably in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it's really the sort of thing that never stops being fun to think about, and there's a fine line between morbid interest and making people feel weirdly guilty for having it.)\n\nWho was the oldest in the group?\n\nI think James from the trucking company, probably around 40.\n\nAnd what was his last name?\n\nHe was the oldest, and he had some issues: alcoholism, drug abuse, etc.\n\nI think I went out looking for him, so I wouldn't go by name: he always called me Jimmy.\n\nHe had a wife and two kids, and that's as far as he went in that direction.\n\n(Although I will note that he was never known as an alcoholic; it's a very specific word and can only be used by people you're close to.)\n\nWhere should we go at dinner?\n\nMy place in the woods.\n\nWhat do you think of the word 'honorable'? And why does it seem to provoke that sort of reaction?\n\nIt was what the guys were calling it; it's sort of like when you hear about guys going AWOL during WWI. They thought it was something that had to be honored.\n\nIf I could wave something away, would it be the fact that I'm getting tired of trying to remember the names of people? Or is it my responsibility to keep a detailed account of those who've been involved in important matters and try to keep a record of them?\n\nIt's hard to say.\n\nIf I die today, what happens to these guys who, by the time I get to them, won't believe that they were part of something like that? Is it fair for them to ask that question? Is it a good question? How does that feel?\n\nIt's always good for someone to ask that question, because it forces you to deal with it, and it also forces the people they talk to to have to talk about it.\n\nThere are, of course, things you can do to erase those memories, but you can't erase everything, since no matter how hard you scrub, you'll always leave traces behind.\n\nI don't mind saying (as I often do) that I've been having my own private memories of those guys wiped from my consciousness for the past 20 years, but I'm not about to let go of their names because I'm sick of trying to think back on them.\n\nThat's sort of the point: if they don't want to remember, I'm fine; if they want to remember, it's up to them to come with me.\n\nI'll always remember what they died for.\n\nBut if they don't want me to remember anymore, I guess I'll let them choose the meaning for themselves.\n\nThis article previously misstated the name of the restaurant where James was shot and killed by the SWAT team.

{"id":4278,"ended":false,"length":733,"gen_text":"Humanity discovers time travel, but it can only be done once. You are the traveller, you have your instructions and have just arrived at your destination.\n\nHowever, that destination is now in your hands... You can go back to the beginning of time and make all mistakes that you should never have made in order to get yourself where you are today.\n\nTime travel is not easy.\n\nTime travel is not safe.\n\nTime travel is not easy.\n\nTime travel is not safe.\n\nI'm not exaggerating, but actually the paradox is actually very well explained HERE. This book will leave you with questions. You will ask yourself; How would I have changed my life? What mistake do I regret?\n\nI know, you want more answers. I know, you want more explanations. I'm just offering you the most effective advice that anyone can give. Hopefully, it will make your life easier and help you live your best life. It will never change the outcome of anything, but it might make you a little bit more positive about it.\n\nYou decide!\n\n\nIt's important to note that there's not one optimal way to do time travel. There are numerous effective solutions that have been tested and implemented countless times, mostly by scientists and mathematicians ; however, I feel that the way in which people implement it is extremely important, especially as a society we often tend to go by our own rules, we forget the common sense of other people and we need to realize, even if the rule is flawed ; afterall that's just common sense :)\n\nNow, let's take a look at the very first book written after the quantum universe and time travel:\n\nI Know That Voice by Sam Harris\n\nSam Harris explains his own views a little better in his very first book written after quantum physics and time travel:\n\n\nI know that voice. I know that voice. People think I'm crazy, I'm a prophet. The only thing that makes sense is that I'm thinking through the last days of my life, that we could be on the verge of a quantum leap in how we understand the world. That's why I chose to devote my career to a lifetime of time-traveling.\n\nHis conclusions\n\nThere's absolutely no doubt that we will try time travel one day and we will find out how stupid we are. We'll discover that we are not the only ones who thought we could go back in time. Maybe someone else tried it with better, more sensible ideas, some even more intelligent people than us. Maybe we will find out that we're not going to be alone in our endeavor and we will look back on our life and see that it had more meaning to us than we could ever imagine.\n\nThere is also absolutely no doubt that time travel is possible. For those who think they are not going to try, that it would be impossible for them, it's absolutely true - and yet, it is perfectly possible.\n\nFor those of you, who have studied physics or mathematics, don't expect it's as simple as that. There are many complex equations and equations in physics that can never be solved by simple equations. It seems that there is no way to predict how complicated the outcome of the equations will be in a quantum universe (or universe with time travel).\n\nLet's remember\n\nTime travel is possible, but I wouldn't recommend it as easy as it seems at first glance.

The Slender Man is the embodiment of a primal fear \u2014 the fear of human extinction. By making it more literal, the Slender Man comes to represent all fears and anxieties that humanity may face on our own terms. It's also a symbol of man's responsibility to protect humans from their very existences \u2014 that we as a collective species are the ultimate source of the fear that the Slender Man represents. A large part of Slenderman history was the battle between the Slender Man's supporters and anti-SLT activists, particularly after an internet troll made a video showing footage of a tall, skinny man in black holding a camera and saying, \"I made you. I gave you a soul.\" The fight culminated with a horrifyingly real encounter, with the Slender Man showing up to try to kill the one who attempted to slay him. This incident gave rise to a new age of anti-SLT activism, and many of the issues the Slender Man symbolized became central to the opposition, such as privacy, the right to bear arms, and government censorship.\n\nThe main character of Harken is this, after he and his brother were kicked out of their families \u2014 after being bullied for a very long period of time \u2014 and then forced to leave the big city of Los Angeles. He ends up making enough money to help move into a small apartment in the suburbs, a place that felt much more isolated than his neighborhood in the city. It's not really mentioned if the main character ever came back to the big city or stayed in Los Angeles to move back in with his brother.\n\nWestern Animation (Live-Action)\n\nIn The Simpsons season 17 episode \"Bart vs. Thanksgiving\", it was revealed that Bart had bought a house in a nice neighbourhood, but no one was too happy about it. In a parody of a similar situation in the \"Happy Family\" episode, Lisa ended up living in the attic on her first Thanksgiving with Bart (which turned out to be Homer's own home, but not so with Bart who lived on his own for the first time). In another parody, it turned out Bart had inherited his family farm from his late mother and his mother had died the night before. Bart eventually found the farm in the middle of nowhere.\n\nOther","token_len":777,"entropy":[7.9507,9.876,1.4104,5.4075,3.9566,1.7433,3.2013,6.4665,2.6541,0.6625,1.7879,1.2656,4.1665,1.0614,3.2808,0.6811,9.9316,10.2572,0.0176,1.239,1.4395,4.724,0.6339,7.7478,0.1763,4.5286,2.2101,3.9981,0.626,4.2346,0.8827,0.9239,2.5189,3.2663,4.0314,0.5313,1.309,1.1767,1.1726,6.0765,0.0994,1.047,1.6541,0.457,2.5584,1.5233,3.6553,4.8271,2.0318,1.7612,1.9217,1.3292,0.9368,2.0815,1.7093,4.73,0.7312,1.7275,2.0002,0.3239,3.2902,0.2179,1.5717,5.946,0.9386,2.6583,2.4162,0.2462,3.2407,4.877,1.2642,4.473,0.2644,0.6663,5.8087,1.6796,0.1803,1.3627,3.7271,1.1294,0.8724,0.015,6.9375,7.1628,0.7536,0.4057,0.0164,0.0067,0.0051,0.0071,0.0018,0.0021,0.037,0.0006,0.0026,0.0021,0.0013,0.0005,0.0009,0.0011,0.0005,0.0008,0.0144,0.0008,0.0021,0.0018,0.0013,0.0002,0.0001,0.0004,0.0011,0.001,0.0015,0.0005,0.0005,0.0009,0.0066,0.0002,0.0029,0.001,0.0005,0.0025,0.001,0.0011,0.0004,0.0012,0.0296,0.0014,0.0014,0.0029,0.0005,0.0012,0.0033,0.001,0.0005,0.0013,0.0005,0.001,1.734,5.3394,1.7477,0.9221,3.426,5.0148,3.9441,1.4333,6.0348,1.3344,1.0767,2.6082,5.288,4.098,3.0474,3.0258,1.3586,3.8753,1.8991,5.3442,1.3528,2.1276,0.924,4.1085,0.4154,5.0366,0.3645,0.1121,0.8578,3.5341,2.8813,0.945,5.8218,3.3981,3.8362,0.4302,2.9951,0.0002,2.9516,2.2549,5.1051,0.5489,5.9869,0.9998,3.5924,0.0201,3.1148,3.4214,1.2574,5.7798,0.4951,0.4692,2.6075,3.2541,2.5344,3.2002,3.0467,0.3849,4.202,2.1739,0.0428,0.9294,4.4198,0.5028,2.7638,1.917,0.2835,3.9917,1.2692,0.0739,3.102,3.3728,2.9638,2.4273,5.3562,1.0468,0.4076,5.5929,1.6324,1.0723,4.3705,8.0331,1.4085,0.0002,4.6224,5.0275,0.3237,0.4653,5.747,0.0831,0.5067,0.0002,1.8909,0.9988,0.1391,0.0361,0.0002,2.3301,0.0011,0.051,0.0124,0.0002,1.6531,0.0032,0.0169,0.0003,0.3028,1.288,0.002,0.0072,0.0002,5.9187,3.8222,0.0239,0.6673,0.0287,0.0011,0.0036,5.7726,0.7675,1.2972,4.7966,5.3623,5.826,0.8897,1.1715,3.8739,0.0496,5.4579,3.4979,0.3357,6.485,5.3945,0.5695,5.7123,2.4511,0.0392,0.4827,2.0474,5.5599,5.3046,0.689,0.7586,0.6007,5.2262,3.9862,1.6394,4.6761,1.4276,0.9618,4.7356,1.2787,2.3006,3.5025,1.4047,1.5557,0.0927,0.3413,1.5402,0.0002,2.3349,5.7313,0.9475,1.6568,2.2227,1.1508,5.24,0.0702,3.8462,0.9838,2.3823,2.8524,2.4607,2.045,0.0332,0.649,0.9431,2.3747,3.0682,0.0308,2.298,4.7808,0.5003,4.7029,1.4636,0.299,0.129,5.4139,4.2524,0.5706,6.1392,4.807,2.3686,2.67,4.3879,0.5077,1.4763,0.4421,0.0159,0.3082,5.9016,0.2219,0.7261,2.9558,2.346,2.3539,2.6914,0.0002,1.6511,2.933,3.3305,1.3619,4.9792,4.3445,1.5375,2.475,0.6274,2.9512,1.1401,2.2455,1.5177,3.1968,0.4178,5.3106,0.1422,5.5961,0.4662,2.4606,6.0106,0.7257,3.2109,6.2186,7.0212,0.1119,3.2953,3.6755,2.5308,4.5265,0.4872,5.1131,1.2125,1.5656,2.3441,3.9701,2.4764,0.0393,1.4955,1.8396,2.3297,1.3965,0.0342,0.0048,0.0272,0.5067,0.3097,5.226,4.4701,0.6464,0.0046,2.9976,0.0114,0.4336,6.184,3.3619,2.0218,4.5356,0.8912,1.2988,0.5722,0.0322,0.0649,3.8546,4.722,0.4365,3.6742,0.0058,3.5972,2.8606,1.7919,1.4991,6.0547,2.5706,4.0372,3.8159,2.2209,3.3196,0.5847,1.858,3.405,5.0113,0.1326,0.8329,5.8817,0.6377,2.2734,1.0784,2.2114,3.3391,4.0229,0.248,4.3694,1.1837,3.2622,1.8567,0.052,1.2942,4.3865,2.4285,2.5673,0.6981,3.8936,0.0317,2.5335,3.3013,1.0683,1.4429,4.8916,3.8784,1.9269,1.2948,5.6508,2.8555,3.017,3.7747,3.1421,2.4929,0.9407,0.5849,0.0123,0.0207,4.4538,0.2033,1.7308,3.161,0.9356,0.9212,0.5796,5.3863,1.605,5.5041,0.0452,5.1259,0.4755,0.5365,3.4503,4.2072,4.1055,0.8654,0.0086,1.8724,2.3371,4.5182,0.1202,2.2954,0.0048,0.2569,0.0426,0.1833,0.7759,1.918,3.662,1.8806,0.3133,5.6181,2.6012,0.1428,0.012,0.0803,1.8757,1.269,2.0949,2.7066,0.4732,0.7144,6.033,2.9207,1.9682,0.0035,3.343,0.9955,2.5603,3.0624,0.0854,2.552,0.0172,0.1756,0.4952,3.7482,3.8102,0.3998,0.9502,0.0002,1.862,4.351,1.3021,0.3172,5.6518,2.7925,4.8355,2.1827,4.4676,1.4686,3.5589,2.0554,2.9219,0.1715,3.5386,2.3242,4.2602,0.0144,0.0434,0.2808,4.894,6.1217,5.205,2.3716,3.7451,1.488,3.2388,3.8093,0.035,4.4123,0.1988,0.0826,1.7479,0.6795,2.2824,3.1357,0.4522,2.6682,1.4743,5.9455,0.0962,2.4239,3.6885,0.0217,0.8661,1.961,2.5122,0.0203,5.8376,6.9952,0.0585,0.7907,4.4764,4.4402,3.1012,0.4884,1.1548,1.7509,1.2586,1.2787,2.4431,0.7559,4.7222,1.0758,1.627,6.0497,3.8256,0.6228,6.4033,1.3462,1.5298,5.9441,1.4283,1.2756,0.2558,0.3378,3.2439,1.0028,2.5495,4.2157,4.215,3.3212,2.3511,4.204,0.1439,2.3885,4.798,0.716,0.3777,1.1571,1.4484,0.0154,2.4543,3.7934,0.4304,3.6703,0.0045,3.4999,5.6438,1.937,0.8628,0.1146,0.0423,1.4691,0.8698,0.4748,0.0003,2.0603,0.0026,8.0681,2.8886,0.3139,0.002,0.1087,0.1809,0.0003,3.4352,2.049,0.5283,5.3802,3.7249,0.6805,0.1641,2.2375,0.0189,2.2548,0.0363,1.3977,0.3076,4.7925,2.9924,0.2787,0.1231,1.2766,1.8911,5.1058,0.6162,1.2439,1.197,1.387,4.9084,3.6992,1.5301,1.2516,4.7534,0.4035,2.846,5.2645,0.7815,0.469,0.3576,0.5624,3.4235,2.4731,3.838,0.1488,3.9896,2.8221,1.0269,0.9912,1.3826,4.8713,5.5116,4.0592,0.6604,0.3027,0.8902,2.8075,4.0827,0.0069,1.7928,0.856,2.5335,2.8607,5.743,1.9726,4.7951,1.6812,1.2381,0.8204,4.2585,3.5147,3.0308,0.0436,0.0909,0.0628,5.1449,0.4268,4.0864,2.4387,

{"id":2921,"ended":true,"length":771,"gen_text":"You and your pet rabbit live in a remote part of Australia, far away from your dark past. Animal control has come to your door and informed you that it is illegal to own a rabbit unless you can prove you are a magician. Now you must do something you swore you would never do again. What would you do? If you're anything like me, you will probably do nothing for ten minutes. In this case, I would take a moment to enjoy the rabbit that's currently in my home as it gets into a trance with me.\nYou probably wouldn't bother with all this just because it's so ridiculous. The only reason it's ridiculous is because this is so absurd that if it actually were actually happening it would actually be funny. The problem with silly things is that people who can't see past their own perspective never realize they're looking at a silly thing.\nThe rabbit's trance state is pretty funny to watch because it's not what a rabbit is trying to do in the first place. Rabbit love is when the rabbit is trying its best to find comfort in another being who feels the same about them. As far as I can tell however, the only difference between a rabbit and a dog during the trance is that a rabbit is more focused on not getting squished by their head or their nose than they are trying to find comfort from someone.\nThe reason why your cat is trying to get comfort from you is because he is trying to feel your love, which is so important to him. He may think your love is a little more physical, similar to the relationship between a human and cat, but my point is the same. It's not about whether or not that's true. As long as you feel it, it gets done like a charm. That's why cats don't even bother trying to make up with their owners because their owners would feel like a failure if they did. It's also why they know there's little they can do to make up with their owners because they don't feel loved enough to try. They don't feel like they deserve to make up so there's not much they can do about it. Cats just have it in for their owners, even when it's not their fault.\nNow we could bring up the whole cat thing here, because not even the rabbit is a problem. Your rabbit is not the problem here. What isn't your problem is that they won't stay dead, not even after they're buried. The problem here is that your rabbit is stuck in a state of denial, where it's unable to accept that it's likely to die and is trying to prevent it from doing so. As far as it's concerned, it's not dead until someone has proven that it's dead. If that happens, then it will have ceased to be. When it knows it's dead, however, it can freely accept that it's unlikely to be found alive, like a child deciding that they're not dead and there's nothing they can do about it. Then it can move on with some confidence that they are indeed dead, and the rabbit will be much happier about it and better able to enjoy its new existence.\nFor you, your rabbit may very well be dead right now because it is currently dying. Once your rabbit learns it's dead, it will then accept that death has occurred and will find ways to embrace life as much as possible. The rabbit will probably live a lot longer than you, and your rabbit might even save you from a similar fate when it tries to save yours when it learns it's time to move on.

{"id":2469,"ended":true,"length":771,"gen_text":"You and your pet rabbit live in a remote part of Australia, far away from your dark past. Animal control has come to your door and informed you that it is illegal to own a rabbit unless you can prove you are a magician. Now you must do something you swore you would never do again. What would you do? If you're anything like me, you will probably do nothing for ten minutes. In this case, I would take a moment to enjoy the rabbit that's currently in my home as it gets into a trance with me.\nYou probably wouldn't bother with all this just because it's so ridiculous. The only reason it's ridiculous is because this is so absurd that if it actually were actually happening it would actually be funny. The problem with silly things is that people who can't see past their own perspective never realize they're looking at a silly thing.\nThe rabbit's trance state is pretty funny to watch because it's not what a rabbit is trying to do in the first place. Rabbit love is when the rabbit is trying its best to find comfort in another being who feels the same about them. As far as I can tell however, the only difference between a rabbit and a dog during the trance is that a rabbit is more focused on not getting squished by their head or their nose than they are trying to find comfort from someone.\nThe reason why your cat is trying to get comfort from you is because he is trying to feel your love, which is so important to him. He may think your love is a little more physical, similar to the relationship between a human and cat, but my point is the same. It's not about whether or not that's true. As long as you feel it, it gets done like a charm. That's why cats don't even bother trying to make up with their owners because their owners would feel like a failure if they did. It's also why they know there's little they can do to make up with their owners because they don't feel loved enough to try. They don't feel like they deserve to make up so there's not much they can do about it. Cats just have it in for their owners, even when it's not their fault.\nNow we could bring up the whole cat thing here, because not even the rabbit is a problem. Your rabbit is not the problem here. What isn't your problem is that they won't stay dead, not even after they're buried. The problem here is that your rabbit is stuck in a state of denial, where it's unable to accept that it's likely to die and is trying to prevent it from doing so. As far as it's concerned, it's not dead until someone has proven that it's dead. If that happens, then it will have ceased to be. When it knows it's dead, however, it can freely accept that it's unlikely to be found alive, like a child deciding that they're not dead and there's nothing they can do about it. Then it can move on with some confidence that they are indeed dead, and the rabbit will be much happier about it and better able to enjoy its new existence.\nFor you, your rabbit may very well be dead right now because it is currently dying. Once your rabbit learns it's dead, it will then accept that death has occurred and will find ways to embrace life as much as possible. The rabbit will probably live a lot longer than you, and your rabbit might even save you from a similar fate when it tries to save yours when it learns it's time to move on. I am not sure where the rabbit on my list of dead rabbit photos is right now, or how long it could be around to enjoy your rabbit life, but my guess is as long as you love it, it will find its best place in

{"id":2590,"ended":false,"length":731,"gen_text":"`` It's human-made, you know! '' Reverse the usual fantasy scene where somebody gushes over elf\/dwarf\/whatever craftsmanship.\n\n: The game is a role-playing game, and the players act out these fantasy genres. In this case, the players should never be the archetypal hero in their own stories. Your players should always show passion, angst, and even horror about being called 'hero.' As game master, you must see this as an opportunity to explore these themes.\n\n'' This can give players interesting things to do that might be better for the game. Players will use their imaginations to create a variety of characters with stories and experiences for characters in stories to connect to. Not all the characters will be elves or dwarves or hobbits. Some will be aliens, elves, dwarves, orcs, and other exotic creatures.\n\nFor an easy, engaging introduction, make your PCs look like adventurers:\n\n'' They don't have to have the full gear and skills to be heroes. Sometimes things can happen that are so dramatic that they make them heroes! If things don't go their way, they might not be heroes. They might not know what they are meant to do when they are called upon to protect the innocents. They might not even feel right calling themselves heroes. (They might still be heroes, but not the ones that society thinks they are!)\n\nThere are a lot of players out there who would enjoy the same roleplay games we play. They could be the game masters, the players who want to know what happens when they come upon a dungeon and they find something terrible. If you want your players to have a story to play in, don't ignore them and their needs and desires. Make sure your players feel like they can leave the game happy or sad or both. I have never liked taking the easy route. No matter how well-done you make your game, if the narrative is not going to make it out anyway, it doesn't matter. If people enjoy it, they will still want to keep playing.\n\nFor the more hardcore game, you could even set up an adventure. Think something like 'The Tomb of Horrors' by Gary Gygax. In this adventure, you have a party of twelve heroes: A Paladin, a Wizard, three Thieves, a Fighter, a Paladin and two Fighter\/Thief buddies. You will set up an encounter and the players will go over the rules. Then, one player gets to adventure, and the other players must keep track of their progress in the story. They can use the rules as a basis to create their own adventure, and if they can't come up with something, the party can take a different one. If all goes well, the players report back to the group and tell them what happened. Then, the group can look for clues, use their imaginations to create their own adventures, or even make their own rules and scenarios to play!\n\nIt's the players who decide what's possible and what's not. (This is my favorite piece of advice.)\n\nThere are many ways (including actual role playing situations) to help players roleplay their characters. You can have your players perform a task on which you think they might fail, and your players decide whether they're going to succeed or not. You might have a challenge where the PCs have to figure out how to use a character as part of a group, or work with the PCs to bring someone else into the game. There's very little role playing involved in a typical game session. Role playing takes a lot of imagination, self-reflection, and planning. The best part about RPGs is that they are always evolving. You never know what kind of adventure or new story you have in store for your players!","token_len":778,"entropy":[7.3419,2.3854,8.9703,4.9231,4.3216,1.8197,4.7014,0.5129,4.2339,7.8987,13.6982,2.6588,6.4749,10.0484,5.9196,4.1324,7.3762,7.7506,2.8977,1.7075,11.6844,5.9779,2.684,0.0257,0.0496,0.935,3.2998,10.7211,1.7694,1.5474,2.9019,0.0709,3.7835,3.7855,5.3589,1.8171,2.5787,4.9415,0.6825,0.0187,0.2555,1.2757,1.9762,1.8435,2.6111,4.9093,1.1921,4.8773,2.1411,5.6046,0.9304,3.6043,2.3104,1.2878,0.1983,0.9586,1.7297,5.1637,5.818,1.9538,3.4868,5.5972,0.5251,0.0011,1.9535,4.2747,2.4374,1.1364,1.839,0.7753,5.609,1.5638,1.1064,3.0048,6.2145,6.168,1.4752,5.1027,0.1647,0.7894,3.2868,4.2362,2.7537,3.4349,5.3523,2.9301,1.6886,3.1871,4.9673,6.7967,0.7503,0.1639,0.5579,3.2357,5.7057,2.6332,0.7292,1.6829,0.1647,0.4111,3.2063,2.8144,1.2194,1.3573,2.1581,0.0002,2.9546,4.2754,3.6302,6.218,2.7814,6.1723,2.8928,0.0137,0.7225,3.6658,2.8653,2.318,4.7563,2.3826,1.1378,0.6596,1.4103,4.7443,2.8387,5.3764,1.4203,4.0413,0.0015,0.6611,1.9344,2.4728,3.8885,0.0032,1.6222,2.9467,6.127,2.0343,5.6157,5.6425,5.0521,2.7986,7.5166,2.9173,5.6655,0.8676,0.2987,5.7899,1.7326,3.9572,1.5823,1.0987,0.6326,5.2045,1.1479,0.1799,2.3209,4.2155,0.02,1.5008,1.6527,1.0199,0.1041,4.0205,0.6132,3.0313,0.3447,1.1742,0.1364,3.0551,0.1345,2.1602,2.5498,3.6597,1.478,0.3467,1.5503,0.0002,5.182,4.5876,4.9719,3.3965,5.3008,3.3317,1.8057,4.4629,2.2656,4.3153,3.7118,0.5137,4.7565,3.0929,0.7407,0.0002,1.7035,3.6166,4.2444,0.0013,1.2795,1.2603,2.27,2.7339,4.6794,2.9001,2.4504,2.9831,3.145,1.2663,0.914,0.8074,5.3998,6.7712,2.7532,1.8666,1.0235,2.6118,2.9514,3.5091,0.7861,1.4503,2.9066,1.38,1.2272,3.7145,4.0098,5.0304,2.955,0.0003,0.8062,2.3948,0.0121,0.241,0.6649,1.6502,2.7589,0.7842,0.9942,1.649,2.3456,0.4911,2.2595,4.5796,1.185,1.2372,1.3857,5.6399,0.0097,0.232,4.3402,0.8707,1.615,1.4506,0.8393,1.1657,4.1902,0.839,4.8589,0.0034,0.8321,1.5655,0.1762,1.0765,2.1163,5.246,3.4365,2.2473,0.1005,0.446,0.5489,5.9478,3.3975,0.6278,3.6717,0.7954,1.1379,0.7625,0.59,2.2495,2.0539,1.5798,2.9499,4.5208,2.2252,0.8735,0.6181,2.4878,1.8295,0.0002,5.14,0.6319,1.9708,1.2355,0.0492,4.925,1.3178,0.0028,0.3578,3.1605,3.8948,2.7566,5.1255,3.1603,3.0758,5.9302,3.9052,1.9368,0.867,2.4226,4.4886,1.3998,2.968,4.8237,1.9612,1.3188,1.6591,1.0572,2.7088,2.6854,0.1633,4.8799,0.9795,1.2871,0.8193,1.0333,5.4908,3.8611,0.8102,4.0205,2.6869,2.7428,3.0333,3.4758,4.0386,0.8274,4.2491,1.035,2.1398,2.4537,0.5528,0.0504,2.3368,1.5161,3.8649,1.919,4.4735,1.6134,0.9809,4.0827,0.0006,4.793,0.7251,2.9817,5.5537,2.5022,3.0497,1.4767,0.2896,3.2332,1.2248,2.0955,0.934,1.9403,0.9513,0.4308,3.2771,6.0289,1.3611,0.5166,5.9556,2.6379,1.6668,1.9413,3.4587,0.4529,5.4996,2.9759,4.1759,5.3447,5.7906,1.8618,1.9881,1.958,1.4722,5.8583,0.8605,0.3892,3.2797,2.0464,4.7367,4.0859,1.2926,0.7153,0.965,0.1662,2.0807,1.8212,7.635,1.4996,1.4851,4.3073,0.5541,2.4501,3.71,4.5019,6.8852,0.096,2.3069,2.0945,0.0004,0.5814,1.9315,2.8828,4.2188,4.3258,2.1189,0.2474,1.0384,0.4766,5.3181,1.2794,0.0899,3.8361,0.2239,0.5601,0.8317,0.0002,4.0579,2.8893,3.2486,3.3701,3.7979,3.7151,1.7374,1.6052,2.8067,4.7471,0.6835,2.9029,1.4086,3.3179,5.3684,6.2412,0.3303,3.6044,1.5553,5.1045,0.0998,1.5413,0.0143,1.1748,2.715,2.2916,0.007,0.0003,0.0,0.6123,3.3087,0.5517,0.5662,0.1219,1.7804,1.6622,1.4107,2.7475,0.2412,6.0514,2.6575,4.5161,4.8065,5.312,0.2559,0.4924,1.7027,0.0231,3.451,3.2522,0.0731,0.7253,1.6261,0.1058,0.4399,4.3111,3.1372,2.7178,2.9972,0.1966,0.311,2.2092,4.6548,0.736,2.3667,3.8632,3.4775,0.6788,2.9622,1.87,2.7418,2.4805,1.4962,0.3563,3.2759,6.3112,1.3129,2.5122,1.5487,2.2512,1.3022,3.5115,1.9585,4.1091,0.9564,5.7833,2.5627,1.2104,0.9529,1.2322,0.5219,3.9852,4.5462,1.1573,0.0527,1.9931,1.9981,2.6538,0.7317,3.0524,0.3199,3.0586,1.9481,3.2537,1.3073,2.7294,1.8335,0.7968,4.3156,1.8316,1.722,0.6338,0.0985,1.687,1.691,2.3937,3.1454,0.4938,3.4506,0.9935,2.4721,0.0791,0.002,1.7825,1.7615,2.6186,3.3292,1.1789,3.9305,1.8101,4.1028,3.6283,0.4475,3.1853,3.7516,0.825,0.0927,0.0677,0.9227,1.408,6.4949,0.1751,0.7456,1.4233,2.7925,1.3585,3.1638,0.5185,0.5696,0.8685,0.6573,2.9107,0.6838,1.0424,1.1409,1.9375,5.1935,2.9474,2.1274,2.0451,4.0018,1.4248,1.4701,0.0018,1.0992,2.2071,2.0624,0.0326,1.9488,0.1791,2.271,2.5511,3.2527,1.5037,0.0145,2.3565,2.7392,4.6841,2.0674,1.2276,3.3663,0.5312,0.0002,4.0711,0.6577,4.0215,2.492,0.975,2.3954,0.9848,3.2356,5.0022,1.5811,0.2336,0.5092,0.3068,0.4013,5.4158,3.2577,0.6226,4.8167,0.7778,5.995,0.0951,0.0712,1.537,1.2407,0.0002,4.2781,0.5929,2.17,1.173,8.5216,3.6303,5.5275,1.5736,3.5739,7.2043,0.2261,0.3291,3.7355,1.0842,3.7327,0.3186,1.7927,0.5402,0.4586,2.8812,0.6535,2.9622,2.3942,0.3316,5.6801,1.842,2.7924,4.5889,5.1079,2.5522,5.8286,0.2277,2.643,1.3224,1.2554,1.5686,5.3564,0.3228,3.8447,1.7082,0.909,3.9755,0.7998,0.0086,2.0686,0.5382,1.0057,0.1137,1.0833,3.6631,0.9999,1.9305,4.2795,1.1528,1.0825,3.425,1.1283,0.113,3.4539,0.0654,0.9516,0.0796,3.07,0.9448,5.079,4.8659,2.7862,0.0021,0.9485,2.5451,1.6102,1.0859,5.0374,2.57,2.6527,4.0555,0.295,5.1721,2.8601,0.9412,0.9955,0.2468,2.1344,0.3459,3.4496,2.3576,

{"id":4081,"ended":false,"length":639,"gen_text":"Human colonists realize their main food source is sapient.\n\n. The MSC is capable of using its internal scanners to scan objects, like space debris or planet surface material for any anomalous data.\n\nThe MSC's engines operate at 12 000 RPM and can hold an atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe MSC's plasma beam is capable of killing a human.\n\nThe MSC is capable of creating a wormhole. However, it is unknown how the MSC created the wormhole. The wormhole will leave the location of the MSC if it is destroyed.\n\nIn \"The Trouble with Tribbles\" the USS Aries manages to use MSC technology to create a wormhole to the planet Triskelion.\n\nMSC was mentioned in the episode \"One Little Ship\" when Trinn Trannis and the crew of the USS Enterprise-D, to go find a Klingon transport, used a type of MSC vessel during the journey through the Moya. It turns out to be a Type-10 shuttlecraft. It is later revealed that the MSC was based on the experimental shuttlecraft that was never meant to be used. The MSC is one of the few spaceships, which was not created in the Federation, that uses Borg technology. However, despite the fact that the MSC was built on the planet Triskelion, the ships technology has no connection with the planet. The two series are unrelated. They are just two different MSC variants like many others.\n\n\nApocrypha Edit\n\nIn the game Star Trek Online, the MSC is a playable vessel on both the Klingon and Romulan faction levels of the U.S.K.R. It was designed by Ensign Kortoski and Lt. Cmdr. L. E. \"Doc\" Smith, the former was a computer expert. The MSC was designed for light-duty interplanetary exploration and combat.\n\nThe story behind its creation has been confirmed as a result of a mission that the playable crew of the Enterprise-E undertook on Triskelion, a planet with an unusual anomaly. The mission featured in the video game Star Trek Online: Klingon Honor Guard mission is based on this events. The MSC is also the starting ship of players aboard the USS Defiant \u2013 a level 40 (T2) Klingon vessel.\n\nThe MSC is featured quite prominently in the fiction authored by Simon Pegg for Star Trek Online, albeit in the form of a playable science vessel. The MSC is the centerpiece of the MEC Trooper (MEC Troopers) career. The two-handed, twin-shot, phaser rifle-toting MECs of the MEC Trooper are capable of engaging enemies both at close-and-medium range. Their primary weapons are dual phase cannons, which can be upgraded to a more destructive version. The MEC also features a secondary weapon which fires multiple high-powered stun rounds which also stun enemies.\n\nThe MEC Trooper class (including its variant, the MEC-3 Defender) is a level 40 mission type available from the New Romulus Command Outpost that contains three of the MECs.\n\nIn the Star Trek novel Star Trek: Year One, the MSC is mentioned as a prototype, which would later eventually see the light of day.\n\n\nVideo games Edit\n\nIn Star Trek Online, the MSC appears as a hangarable starship on Level 4 (Tier 5), for use by playable crewmen on the MSC in-game currency.

{"id":3774,"ended":true,"length":724,"gen_text":"An asteroid is plummeting to Earth. People have chosen to spend their last day with no regrets, indulging in their wildest fantasies and assuming there will be zero repercussions. That is, until the asteroid misses Earth, leaving everyone to deal with the consequences of their actions.\n\nHowever, that assumption is wrong.\n\n\nIt turns out that there are repercussions because people have choices.\n\n\nSo let me give you the answer to the question in the title of this page - what if there is no such thing as cosmic consequences? What if we all live and learn inside of the bubble of our own universe and each and every one of us are able to take it or leave it whenever?\n\nNow that being said, you have two options :\n\nYou're a selfish asshole; Either take on the responsibilities that come with having multiple people with different opinions living inside of your bubble, or live a life of regret and regret the things you've chosen to do instead of living in love with your life\n\nYou're a fucking moron; Either live your life in ignorance, choosing to think everyone else is an asshole, living inside your own bubble, making mistakes ; or you are a smart person with a good conscience, choosing to help people, help your friends get on track and learn something new\n\nWhich one is better?\n\nTo your credit you clearly made a good choice, choosing the latter instead of the former.\n\n\nAs for the rest of us, we may think we're the only ones who are supposed to make the tough decisions and live with the consequences of our life's choices.\n\n\nAnd we're right, we are the only ones who understand how far that can take us.\n\n\nSo let's just say it this way, you're an asshole if you choose to be a selfish asshole.\n\nAnd you're a stupid moron if you choose to live in ignorance.\n\n\nRegardless of where we are, how far I am from my loved ones, my career or anything else that may be different from the one I'm living in today, I choose to love it with all my heart and soul.\n\nThe reason I say that is, if you know what love really is, it's a feeling, it's an emotion.\n\n\nWhen we lose the feeling of love in our relationship with a certain person, we'll eventually choose to stay in a relationship with them.\n\n\nWhen we grow up and realize those feelings of love don't exist anymore and can't exist, we choose to stay away from them.\n\n\nAnd if we don't want to stay away from them, we either choose, choose to grow up and stop thinking it's okay to make a choice that's so personal, that if it's wrong, there are no consequences ; or we decide to take our own risks, and take the actions to move forwards.\n\n\nDon't worry if you're doing what's right or wrong, just know that your life has consequences, your love, your family, your relationships are all connected and have to be taken care of properly and with regard for others.\n\n\nAll in the end, we need to do our part.\n\nWe'll help each other.\n\nAnd I promise that if we decide to take our own risks and move forwards, we'll be able to see the consequences of our actions and have the possibility to either

{"id":3690,"ended":false,"length":741,"gen_text":"You are a well known guitarist. You wake up in 18th Century London with only your favourite guitar. After while, you wonder if Georgian London is ready for some Punk. Well i am here to tell you that it is... Punk London.\n\nPunk London is a creative collective from London that wants to rock the world with Rock, Riff, Punk and Hardcore music. As soon as you download our music on iTunes or any of our albums, you can be sure to see our music in front of hundreds of fans everywhere where i play. This is just the start. We have already released some live shows : The first band from Punk London was The Spoons! This is the first band on the site that has live recording. If you follow this link : http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/spoonslondon, you can see the first live show with 8-in-10 live action videos! In the future, we hope to create live and video releases from every band on the site and from the Spoons and the Black Tapes. Every release will include the original video. We want to give you the best experience. We have no limits to give you the best Rock Band ever made. You won't have to ask from your friends to buy it because we already put the rock to your hands. When you download our music for the first time, you will get 3 CDs of the latest material. Then we will make the best release ever for you.\n\nWe are a collective that started over a year ago because we could never live as a solo group. We played a lot of shows together like many different groups and we got more and more excited with every show. We decided to form a group by taking the best bits from our friends and joining forces for the long distance between each other. Our vision for the future is to become the biggest band that rock could ever be and we want to release our live albums for free to all of those who want to download our music!\n\nWe are going to release 7 albums this year with lots of new material that will include many bands that we have never shared the stage with before, some of them that are from around the world. We will release three CDs in total that contain all of the latest live performances we do on a weekly basis. For each of the 7 albums we will release a live recording, and 3 different versions for different formats such as vinyl, CD and now we will release our latest Live album to all our fans worldwide! What we offer is a unique Rock Band experience, where you get to play with new bands that you are not aware that existed before and then play songs from your favourite bands that you have never heard before!\n\nYou can see for yourself that we are the pioneers of this movement. But we want to become even bigger by doing what there big bands can't do and making this new \"Rock Band \" part of everyone's lives. We want to give the best Rock Band that no one has ever heard of a way to be heard everywhere in the world by all artists that like Rock.\n\nPunk London is also about \"Making sure that the music that you love is shared across all channels so that everyone can enjoy Rock and Rock Music everywhere.\n\n\"Punk London\" is all about Rock music that has no boundaries, it is not just about Hip-Hop, rap, EDM, pop or anything in between. This is Rock from the rockers of today to the rockers of yesterday to the rockers that we are in our 30's that could never have played in the 50s but are still coming back as well as the Rock bands that are on tour today or playing in the future! Punk London aims to create a collective with similar experiences of the past and hope to continue to grow with new experiences, all to the same

{"id":3372,"ended":true,"length":728,"gen_text":"The world's population receives a message that in 10 hours their minds will be'shuffled ', with everyone's mind being transported to another random body anywhere else on earth, of roughly the same age but with no other defined characteristics. What happens?\n\nIn one short afternoon, the new earth will be filled with other species, like ants and other animals, all with a different mental state.\n\nThe earth that humans have chosen will be a planet full of other life with different mental states and personalities. This is similar to how different people react when given a choice between a box and a house. If you were to offer that box to any other person, the new owner would have no idea it was anything other than a box, but most of us would have no idea it was a house either since we grew up with a belief the house was a box. In this new universe, there's a large chance your mind will be transferred to another random living person, with little chance it will have a particular personality.\n\nWhat will happen is that your mind will change, and there's no getting it back.\n\nWhile it might seem weird that the earth won't have a physical body, there is a lot of evidence that the earth will not physically have a physical body like we currently imagine it does.\n\nIn fact, it might not have even the mind, instead being a quantum computer like every other point (and point with many points) in the universe, that can'switch between point and point without loss or damage. That means every point on the earth's current location in time is a point that the earth'd never know. The earth will not have a physical body, only a quantum computer that stores all the information we experience in the physical world and uses it to experience other point's, so in effect, this part of the universe is the entire physical world.\n\nWe are all in a quantum computer's universe! So, where does the earth's physical body come into play?\n\nThe physical body must be replaced or it will just continue traveling through space and time with no physical body, meaning this is an extremely dangerous situation, and people living today are currently at their own physical peril.\n\nThere's absolutely no reason why the earth can't simply have a'time out'and let the new world arrive, but instead we allow ourselves to be enslaved to this computer, only existing in the physical world for short amounts of time just being on the internet. Instead, the earth can now continue living out the physical universe, but with the entire world going with it, so this is an incredibly positive new world for everyone in the universe, not just humans.\n\nOur only hope is that there are many humans living outside this universe to'contact'each other, but the chances are virtually zero. But even if we can't find anyone else that isn't already in the computer, we can always help someone else. A few years ago we created a site to help people in the other universe contact people in our computer's universe, but the chances for success are vanishingly small.\n\nIf you're interested in helping someone in the other universe, please contact ken ( ken.miller@yahoo.com ), he'll help you find someone's closest living relative, if you don't already know your soul mate' s contact details, here are some links.\n\nTo join our mailing list please send email to: ken.miller@yahoo.com\n\n( click to see the list of people we have known that could be helped )\n\nIn summary, we are now free of our physical mind, just a computer that stores all the information we experience. All we have left is to let go of all the other humans'physical bodies, by transferring their minds to a quantum computer's universe.","token_len":782,"entropy":[5.7385,1.4981,4.481,9.7891,2.808,7.1642,2.6951,5.6763,5.6449,6.4858,5.0257,6.7453,0.6629,0.3742,12.081,6.2342,4.2572,1.6664,11.8907,4.9325,7.3449,2.9872,1.9053,1.1541,6.5845,0.4284,2.5883,6.8785,5.849,7.4487,5.543,1.3688,1.9344,2.0422,6.4393,6.6727,0.5827,0.066,0.6714,5.4965,1.4777,2.8458,4.5342,9.2195,2.1511,0.6226,5.6725,2.3181,2.9232,2.7086,0.0624,3.4923,3.6513,5.675,5.2093,0.576,1.4699,5.3922,6.743,2.1051,0.9229,3.113,0.086,5.2603,6.331,1.3312,5.1568,3.602,1.2565,4.7655,3.68,0.9354,3.2582,2.3979,2.8504,2.0535,4.8214,1.787,1.1894,3.081,0.0002,2.0092,5.2713,5.077,5.4911,2.2511,4.1694,1.7926,0.8699,2.24,3.7586,2.8888,0.0072,3.1129,3.8141,4.6782,1.3319,1.5396,0.0845,2.3395,3.3759,0.6532,2.9433,1.2112,5.0101,0.042,1.9449,4.3535,3.0469,3.1184,1.8136,4.1644,1.2363,1.8219,1.0168,1.7363,5.5863,2.41,0.1824,4.4356,0.7302,3.2972,0.966,2.7679,1.5585,4.3055,3.7963,1.1559,0.3142,3.6316,1.5623,0.621,0.5649,3.4365,4.8328,2.1145,0.3925,3.1941,1.053,0.9842,4.554,0.3507,4.0316,0.6297,0.0076,0.401,0.6908,1.5795,2.1549,5.5522,2.3805,1.0674,0.8942,3.2638,0.3154,2.1343,1.686,0.1481,0.8826,0.0638,3.0657,7.4293,0.7092,5.415,0.0065,1.6963,2.3724,6.6878,4.0661,1.1661,0.9886,1.809,0.3802,0.3944,3.9016,1.8966,2.9404,2.5994,0.3242,3.2786,3.5532,2.0389,4.8827,2.4076,3.8031,2.0234,0.4521,0.3958,3.7173,0.3335,1.7162,2.1303,5.1032,2.2646,1.6006,2.8333,5.0541,1.2287,3.086,0.2342,3.9334,1.4831,4.1725,0.8278,1.0055,0.5728,0.0002,3.563,2.514,0.4962,3.6492,0.8499,2.3787,0.9493,0.2206,4.2396,2.0332,1.7187,4.3659,1.1702,0.9736,4.977,0.8688,0.0096,0.4194,1.8442,0.0002,5.1371,2.3866,2.8116,0.9273,4.4953,1.7707,2.2602,3.4247,5.0127,0.0018,2.4745,1.2844,3.3657,0.8846,0.7921,2.9858,1.7814,0.8901,4.0111,0.272,1.4463,1.1128,2.272,1.6218,2.5045,2.3989,3.2178,3.7909,0.357,0.443,0.403,4.7139,1.2584,3.5947,4.3047,0.9465,1.6485,0.2007,1.5136,0.0002,3.1709,2.4155,0.0882,2.5128,2.8587,1.22,1.388,3.0116,4.0367,4.9339,3.1865,5.5105,1.836,1.0493,4.8803,0.9231,4.5712,5.4111,0.1665,5.6204,7.5437,2.6311,1.9783,5.1437,2.8108,1.4428,0.196,0.3198,0.686,0.2698,2.7114,3.5752,2.7004,9.372,6.7247,2.592,5.2419,1.3498,0.1825,4.1655,4.948,2.1696,5.1125,0.3632,4.6027,2.4499,4.7673,1.3065,2.956,0.262,0.625,2.7938,5.7848,3.17,3.0517,3.7311,2.0768,1.769,1.1158,2.8646,3.5074,0.5454,11.1925,5.4015,2.7417,3.1546,3.0404,0.998,2.0688,2.947,1.3627,0.5505,0.423,0.1354,1.0601,3.6361,0.6019,1.0347,0.1883,1.4172,4.0346,2.5545,1.6764,0.8371,3.2266,3.6317,1.7466,1.4663,1.8314,0.3425,2.6278,3.5397,0.7384,0.3179,4.7603,3.1599,3.4918,1.2972,5.4807,4.275,3.6432,2.598,0.914,4.836,6.4194,0.0633,0.2676,0.709,0.8188,2.6624,3.5062,2.3763,0.9034,1.1404,0.3797,0.0002,4.2174,2.512,2.499,3.186,1.7065,1.1728,0.3028,4.8233,3.5363,5.071,4.9402,2.6704,4.8426,1.7551,1.5062,2.7593,2.1083,2.2966,0.2283,1.1984,1.8144,0.7268,0.104,0.704,0.0002,1.5786,1.9329,0.4625,5.3751,1.1395,5.4339,4.0922,3.784,0.3869,5.2889,2.8817,6.3466,1.9591,1.8312,1.6126,0.18,3.6456,0.5534,2.6303,0.6299,2.3294,4.7157,4.559,2.5247,3.4744,3.899,1.9048,1.8682,2.5146,1.8988,4.6924,5.446,5.9998,1.5966,4.5025,4.0099,5.0253,3.1803,2.9703,1.0325,0.3664,0.5745,0.0002,3.6142,1.8584,5.9352,0.1613,2.4993,1.778,1.1668,0.3971,1.9553,0.0044,3.0262,4.7295,0.8776,15.4508,5.8483,4.9934,4.6911,5.8934,5.4138,1.1603,1.587,3.2264,5.0326,1.4461,1.6574,3.0665,2.1734,5.7604,2.7379,0.0556,0.6263,4.1398,1.2816,2.0767,4.3836,2.1975,5.5139,5.2578,1.3103,1.434,2.3508,0.187,2.4198,3.6025,2.4982,0.0055,0.0107,5.9161,6.7325,4.99,0.9321,1.5536,1.3381,4.8008,0.858,1.8273,0.7961,2.6937,5.9871,5.2914,4.3041,3.187,2.666,4.1885,3.6442,1.5123,2.3937,2.0112,2.0148,4.6962,2.2986,5.5096,5.1041,1.1566,1.2487,3.1417,4.1692,1.5845,2.6873,2.6604,3.7469,5.6607,1.566,2.2894,1.2882,3.9584,1.0955,0.985,1.878,2.5757,0.2872,1.9438,0.3109,0.3122,0.0002,5.0179,4.2981,1.9604,0.4013,0.6114,3.64,1.4352,2.7606,3.5848,3.1288,3.8139,2.8103,2.1154,4.3329,11.2374,8.7982,4.2923,4.7526,0.1786,1.3707,2.5925,3.0835,2.4126,1.9568,5.9959,0.7647,0.9775,4.6967,3.5532,0.4046,2.1202,2.8439,0.9318,2.9683,1.962,1.852,4.8032,4.8762,0.0076,1.9584,1.727,1.1333,1.0272,0.561,1.4029,0.5947,3.5518,5.1563,4.7248,1.2049,2.6749,5.1616,3.5297,2.4988,0.1989,3.291,3.311,0.846,3.9174,2.4342,0.3853,1.2083,2.9667,1.2848,3.669,0.4796,1.4062,2.153,0.8929,1.3714,3.2005,2.1405,0.1651,1.0751,1.6938,2.6869,2.8516,3.6018,2.0425,0.3945,5.1213,0.0172,0.217,0.5663,0.8339,0.0002,2.7277,0.7373,1.6822,1.5309,0.1758,1.247,2.1994,1.5644,0.7877,0.5468,0.0764,0.9955,2.0947,2.2095,7.4117,3.317,4.3546,4.2876,0.509,1.831,3.7179,2.2075,0.5526,3.434,0.0073,0.1333,1.8613,3.1502,2.0137,1.8376,0.3486,2.4404,1.4372,6.3531,4.4,4.0863,0.437,1.7402,3.5389,1.3353,2.6318,0.0022,1.5745,0.2768,4.5209,5.9341,0.65,6.9947,7.8302,6.3869,2.0464,2.0831,6.4325,2.2462,1.3652,3.7033,2.5985,0.4991,0.0002,4.3229,5.6692,1.6654,2.8964,0.0171,3.5354,1.9573,3.0561,0.076,1.6687,1.3848,0.0936,0.8678,0.0195,0.0003,0.0122,0.0449,0.0017,0.0068,0.8142,0.0002,4.566,6.9724,3.2684,3.5521,1.9112,1.5354,1.0842,1.5824,2.2129,1.5931,5.7252,3.2601,5

{"id":3852,"ended":true,"length":732,"gen_text":"On your 17th birthday, instead of the usual boring presents from your parents, they say that your grandfather left you 10 millon dollars and a small island on the opposite side of the world, asking you to `` finish what he started ''.\n\nYour mother was in disbelief, since she thought that money was something you could simply buy in shops, when all she did was take a part time job for the money.\n\n\nIt took you several months until you decided to quit school, so you could better yourself, before you finally started to make any real progress.\n\n\nOne day your grandfather came to watch you at the store, he wanted to talk to your mom about him being so rich.\n\n\nAs you looked up towards him you could tell he was very old but for some reason you feel that you would be able to converse with him any way.\n\n\nWhen asked what he did, your grandfather replied : `` I started a business like you. But I'm a very successful businessman!'' your parents were speechless, you were the first one to talk to them since Grandfather passed away.\n\nYour grandfather made some money helping other people.\n\n\nThey found out that your grandfather was also a very good singer, so your mom asked him to teach you how to sing so that you would become a professional singer.\n\n\nHe started the lessons, even after hearing all your song, which was so beautiful.\n\n\nOne day, your parents came home, and they saw Grandfather, doing his job, he always listened to you, he could always understand you. At first they were worried that your grandfather would find out, but that never happened, he would always come home after work and he would go to the shop to help you get ready.\n\n\nHe would always let you work on his computer whenever he had the time, and even at dinner time, he would sit at the kitchen counter listening to your singing.\n\n\nHe didn't notice any change in your performance, but you felt that your life was beginning to progress, and you could finally sing in front of people.\n\n\nYou even won the Best Song of the Year Award for the next 4 years.\n\n\nEverytime, you would get so excited to hear Grandpa's response, and you did everything you could to make sure Grandpa heard everything you said.\n\n\nGrandma passed away in 2010, and you finally managed to win all the 3 year Old Grandpa awards.\n\n\nYour grandfather has now passed away, but you kept your promise to him, to take care of him till he could no longer take it. Now you help some of his family people who are very weak, they live at the same house where your family is. When you were a kid, you would come by everyday and see the old lady, sometimes it was painful watching all of Grandma's old people who couldn't walk anymore, your grandfather couldn't walk much either.\n\n\nBut you never wanted to take advantage of this, so you never told your grandfather that you were going to visit him, so he didn't miss the opportunity to see his youngest grandson.\n\nYou don't know what's going to happen to him, maybe he'll be taken care of, maybe he won't, maybe he'll try to pass away slowly, maybe it'll happen on his last breath, it doesn't matter, because it's your job to take care of him, it's your responsibility.\n\n\nIn the time that you are alive, he has already passed on, on his last breath.\n\nThe only good thing is, when you see this old man, with only his clothes on, he can still smile, and he can still talk to you. He can still hear all of the good memories, and you know, you are one of the lucky ones.","token_len":782,"entropy":[4.9645,9.8094,0.1221,0.0768,0.4461,6.5292,0.0065,3.1865,1.8899,6.7202,5.447,3.0072,0.5072,0.5743,0.2004,4.3086,6.124,3.4532,3.7146,5.8675,3.6832,0.3876,5.3424,9.5269,2.1463,1.5298,2.4197,1.8791,4.9442,2.9585,3.0609,1.2065,6.2236,0.2854,0.0053,0.0398,0.3157,2.2981,7.0264,0.3118,0.0987,14.6266,13.352,1.8366,0.661,0.05,5.0998,0.9139,2.4945,0.0635,3.3417,2.8531,4.1842,4.0312,4.303,1.372,4.8192,1.1518,2.3523,0.9155,5.1223,0.8928,2.9513,1.6607,1.8691,4.3155,1.9881,4.3637,2.8693,1.735,4.9085,3.8007,1.2908,3.4294,0.1637,3.6205,2.1173,4.6968,1.0857,0.0396,4.5958,1.8058,2.623,0.702,5.148,0.0002,4.4538,2.2761,0.8198,3.6156,1.202,5.1185,0.1457,4.3667,0.254,4.3637,1.7569,1.5254,3.2514,0.702,0.402,5.9927,2.9697,1.5864,5.5501,0.739,3.178,3.1217,1.625,2.6794,4.7075,1.82,1.3022,0.6414,1.2109,0.0002,3.9207,0.4115,3.0806,1.5911,1.9639,0.6525,6.9331,0.2965,3.9028,2.4204,3.6726,0.6495,2.7114,3.672,0.2173,2.9653,0.3353,5.081,1.7206,1.1758,5.2116,2.9397,2.298,2.0815,1.0598,1.0601,0.0002,4.1374,0.9562,3.859,2.746,4.6509,1.2011,3.2072,1.6599,3.2394,1.6232,0.2769,2.8338,2.1248,4.9354,5.994,0.828,0.0866,1.5044,5.3692,1.7455,1.8919,4.1496,1.3103,1.8877,0.0056,6.3903,0.0307,0.229,0.0629,5.5756,1.3509,1.0399,0.3654,0.0002,3.4801,5.1386,1.7068,0.7226,1.8113,1.7621,1.9224,0.0999,1.6837,5.8259,1.8965,0.6726,3.1685,0.9663,1.655,6.1041,1.2946,3.2208,3.582,1.2282,2.7401,2.4016,3.0305,3.2804,0.5365,4.1325,1.8456,7.3744,5.2734,1.1075,3.9748,0.0002,1.2341,2.5784,2.5565,2.6686,1.3457,1.9614,0.8473,4.0625,0.4926,1.3951,2.2955,7.2704,2.2003,2.5641,0.2132,0.5322,1.5277,0.0001,1.6423,1.448,5.5422,3.9856,4.1846,6.5049,2.9687,0.5532,3.6154,1.3886,0.0002,4.6311,5.0439,0.642,0.3666,1.6213,0.175,1.1085,3.5867,0.9649,2.1176,1.7957,4.2199,0.716,1.9988,2.5646,1.7991,2.5895,0.492,0.3073,1.9899,0.6428,1.0218,0.0175,0.3613,4.0747,1.1185,0.2058,2.5096,3.0385,1.1937,3.4978,0.4596,0.5495,0.4636,0.0002,2.9366,3.2608,4.1799,1.1592,1.8318,4.8348,3.7807,5.0451,3.2497,2.2435,5.5455,1.9661,4.8898,1.4738,2.9157,2.876,2.1457,0.4561,0.0002,3.0607,0.1431,2.0383,1.2052,3.4003,1.913,1.4915,2.2362,1.3395,2.6225,2.3569,2.7216,0.2521,3.661,5.7145,1.9306,1.9733,1.3407,3.4521,6.2295,4.5012,0.2536,1.3911,1.7275,2.1496,4.4269,3.2769,2.3848,1.0296,1.0435,7.0381,1.1138,1.7125,1.2563,2.8279,1.5304,2.3622,0.258,2.2217,5.9783,0.4494,1.8355,0.4488,4.9199,1.526,0.091,1.6475,1.2931,3.9873,0.7147,3.3971,1.3483,2.8554,0.783,1.5972,4.3274,0.4877,4.9318,0.6697,1.5717,3.0847,1.3282,2.6104,1.0926,5.5815,1.4467,1.3399,0.4064,0.0002,2.5755,1.8889,1.7164,5.3846,0.0733,4.3637,1.814,1.6655,5.4611,5.1939,1.507,2.1256,2.2512,0.4032,0.649,1.6813,3.4354,5.1206,5.1099,0.3333,0.8903,0.8782,0.2232,2.4611,2.0249,0.4353,2.2445,3.2389,5.3472,0.0646,1.1027,2.6575,0.4953,0.2987,0.0003,2.1455,5.0346,0.0055,4.8917,3.2375,1.8298,0.3169,1.0656,3.9491,0.5616,1.6461,2.2114,2.7399,0.8964,1.7975,4.815,0.65,3.9778,0.0839,5.4532,1.3076,1.4849,0.7904,3.0333,1.9389,6.1193,2.7288,0.1983,0.007,0.8897,0.5546,0.2951,0.0002,2.6639,4.0474,3.3867,1.6584,4.8714,2.8277,2.7958,0.0863,0.4681,1.1785,2.5649,1.8518,3.4792,4.214,0.0401,1.3602,0.3204,0.0003,5.0302,2.5248,5.5344,1.6154,0.8675,3.3694,2.5774,0.7876,2.3417,2.5004,2.659,3.4423,0.99,6.6096,1.0886,1.7528,1.0043,5.9777,1.6094,1.5121,0.0702,0.218,2.1402,2.0614,3.4484,0.0739,2.1465,4.4646,0.4076,2.1224,0.4433,0.2581,0.0002,4.2813,2.2208,6.0315,0.0585,2.1689,3.386,0.2968,0.8844,1.5963,4.2011,5.0929,0.0104,4.9657,4.8518,0.6846,6.2928,5.8695,4.6183,1.4448,1.4937,1.9229,0.9392,0.4253,0.0002,1.9149,1.7268,4.5679,2.9074,0.85,0.2562,0.5153,1.2695,0.8239,4.797,2.2598,0.7135,0.5633,2.0227,0.8366,2.9862,3.7923,0.6054,0.0123,1.9248,4.1493,0.8368,3.1905,0.6665,0.0085,0.7479,3.7916,0.7892,5.9743,0.8739,5.6787,6.2391,1.6643,1.2483,3.4067,6.5695,2.8322,1.2452,3.889,4.3457,0.7962,4.2538,3.2528,3.1418,0.7836,3.2895,0.7247,2.8373,1.5052,2.7781,2.4882,1.2188,6.1507,0.8199,2.3577,2.0898,1.3218,0.5598,0.769,1.744,3.7466,3.5469,5.0831,1.6045,4.3064,2.6382,1.3691,3.3103,1.7968,4.751,4.1162,1.0777,4.9064,5.1072,5.5724,2.4626,5.1916,1.5294,0.1634,2.431,1.7118,3.5647,2.5265,0.0029,1.9545,1.0621,0.7062,4.5827,0.7974,3.8077,0.0013,2.2865,4.1617,1.0286,0.9397,0.4979,0.0003,2.2058,1.0248,2.8143,3.5364,0.1833,3.272,3.2334,0.0562,3.5934,1.4654,2.0003,0.2273,1.3704,2.979,1.5574,2.7088,1.2997,0.2799,1.4455,1.0115,0.0688,3.7275,1.4905,1.213,2.8326,1.0256,2.6773,0.0011,4.8184,3.1615,1.511,0.3326,1.0877,2.1819,5.7973,0.9735,0.8189,1.9969,0.0001,1.6616,4.1616,0.0025,0.9684,1.7003,4.3383,1.0542,0.2706,0.0272,1.0962,1.8746,0.9628,3.0273,0.3184,1.9012,1.9097,2.7844,1.0631,0.0227,1.8671,0.6468,0.2385,1.3798,0.0011,1.1937,1.9895,0.3968,0.7018,5.7382,0.2276,5.2909,1.109,5.7597,0.938,1.8178,3.9368,1.4705,4.1578,4.3441,0.3944,5.6586,2.2486,0.9041,3.438,2.0835,0.0006,0.1804,1.2794,2.8614,3.3313,0.7268,1.9731,1.2785,0.2574,0.631,0.0308,0.0092,0.203,1.2698,3.4222,0.1617,0.3661,1.5974,0.9666,0.5557,0.0002,4.6328,1.2751,4.9323,1.3539,0.5055,3.0021,3.087,0.1916,3.3853,2.9956,2.0156,1.4085,3.1605,0.879

{"id":1973,"ended":true,"length":735,"gen_text":"Two introverts are trying to hide from the drunken masses at a High School party gone wild. Tell me the story of them meeting in the only quiet room of the house.\n\nIs it that they're scared to talk to people who can't fit them in because of their social nicety? But also because they'd rather enjoy their party experience in their own private world?\n\nOr is it because those introverts really are introverted? In all other ways and positions of life.\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that most people are social animals. And most people are also introverted. We have all been socialized with the basic premise that one thing doesn't interfere with the other.\n\nIn school, we are taught our social skills via the use of a number of social tools: talking, passing notes, writing things down, passing a conversation away with other people, exchanging jokes with friends and even, for those who really want to, showing and sharing our physical selves. As part of our curriculum, however, we also learn to interact with people without being on the outside looking in.\n\nSo, imagine for a moment you're at a party with your friends and some new people who like to dance. Suddenly, out from your group you hear someone say loud enough so the whole room can hear, \"I like dancing!\"\n\nNow, you're now confronted with your own social anxiety. At first, you're trying to stay quiet and try to make friends because you don't know anybody who likes to dance. But, that's as far as you can get because you know now, this one person will only be a hindrance because no one sees them dancing if they talk, and if no one sees them dance, you're stuck looking at somebody who doesn't dance because there's nowhere to look.\n\nNow, what happens? I don't know if this is the right analogy but, for some strange reason, the introverted brain seems to just freak over people talking. The introverted brain doesn't want to be with people. And it may even appear to you that the people who like to talk are a constant, unending annoyance until you try to stay silent and the conversation dies.\n\nSo, if that's how introverted people experience talking, you're not going to like my next analogy. When you talk, your brain is literally thinking \"I don't want to talk with anyone, now where will it stop?\"\n\nAnd if you think about introverted people, they tend to be introverted, so you think, it must be that people who are introverted are trying to avoid talking.\n\nBut they aren't. It really is the opposite.\n\nThey just choose not to want to talk.\n\nWhich leads all of us to this interesting question: Would it exist if we had never learned to talk?\n\nIt might be easier for everyone if we did but, if we learn to speak, that's going to make us feel a little uncomfortable, to start the process of trying to hide from people, to feel awkward around people. It also probably will make us more nervous at parties.\n\nSo, in other words, we are conditioned to not want to talk to others. And it isn't a \"good\" reason to avoid meeting new people in a way.\n\nAs a result, when introverted people experience a good conversation in a party, they're very conscious about how people are feeling around them.

{"id":3232,"ended":false,"length":673,"gen_text":"- You are an angel of heaven. Angels are tasked with creating animals to populate the earth. You are called into God's office to discuss your finished project - the platypus. You are asked to create a mate for your brother and create a family.\n\nThe Platypus was designed by the American Naturalist Charles Darwin to answer a question that humans have pondered for as long as humans have existed:'How is it that we are related to platypus and lizards? '\n\nIt is a mammal and like all mammals it walks on two feet. The platypus has two small, backward peepers that are so unique that people who can't see them can't describe them. They are only visible to the most highly specialized vision. A normal primate's vision is more like twenty times brighter than a platypus's. Although the Platypus is thought to be the evolutionary predecessor of humans, it lived during the time humans didn't even exist.\n\nThe Platypus is unique in that it has five lungs - making it so much more specialized for breathing. Unlike other mammals, animals that breathe in air also have to breathe out air. When the Platypus breathes, it puffs out air from its lungs to inflate its chest cavity where the lungs are located. Platypi do this by flapping their wings.\n\nThe Platypus is thought to be the oldest hominin mammal. As human brains evolved, those of mammals got more brain neurons. The brain cells required for perception and motor control are also more important. The Platypus gets this ability by having only three sensory organs: hearing, smell, and touch. The platypus has no fur. The Platypus only has two types of eyes : one with an array of little colored rods and cones in the center which allows it to see in three dimensions and the other where each eye has a single photoreceptor.\n\nIt is the platypus's two nostrils that helps it sense light. Humans only have one nostril that opens outward while you have two that open inward.\n\nThe Platypus was discovered in the late 1800's. Until the late 1800's, platypuses were rare and most people did not even know what they looked like. But as humans began to explore the world and encounter new animals and things, platypi began to be studied, and the world we know now was created.\n\nThe platypus is considered to be the most bizarre land animal. Platypi are found only in Australia, Tasmania, and Papua New Guinea. They usually live out long lives and they often mate for life.\n\nPlatypuses are solitary creatures. Platypuses communicate using a form of speech called'sonorous '. They communicate mostly through song and other signals such as squealing.\n\nPlatypuses, platypus are the only vertebrates that have penises that are used for both mating and for sexual control of territory.\n\nPlatypuses have very primitive teeth. Platypuses use these teeth mainly as tools to extract food from different kinds of plants and to remove parasites from their skin. They rarely have oral glands, but they do have'glands which secrete a lubricating oily substance and which are known to provide protection against tooth decay.\n\nAs with all mammals, a platypus's eyes are connected to its brain. Like humans, they have hair on their bodies also.\n\nThe platypus is thought to have originated in Australia. Early mammal scientists who first discovered the platypus thought that it was just a different type of dog or cat. But when the study of anatomy and physiology began in the early 1900's humans realized that it was the only mammal with a brain, and it was therefore

{"id":4742,"ended":false,"length":669,"gen_text":"The main character is a villian. He is not secretly a good guy with a depressing backstory, and there is no happy ending.\n\nIs one of the main elements that separates the Good Story from the Evil Story; because in the Good Story the villain did the right thing and has a great backstory that leaves him innocent, he may be a complete sociopath with no history of personal struggles or personal anguish.\n\nThe author is attempting to paint a picture in the minds of the reader of where he got the idea and it is easy to identify the author's point of view. The story becomes so engrossing that it doesn't matter that he is writing on a subject that has no real relevance to real life\u2014it's what makes his stories work. Sometimes the author's point of view is a self-serving one, and he is trying to push his own agenda. In other cases, the author is simply ignorant and is making what he knows to be a silly argument.\n\nSometimes the villain's actions are so egregious that his actions are so beyond ridiculous that he qualifies as the protagonist in any story in which the character actually does not go on a murderous rampage like he does.\n\nSometimes, when the villain does horrible things, the hero's own actions serve to underscore how horrible he is.\n\nContrast with Badass Bookworm, who is evil without being evil, and Badass Rube, who is evil without being particularly evil. Also compare Super-Villain Protagonist, when that's what they are. See also The Evil Prince, the Evil Emperor and Evil Overlord, whose motivation may be the very opposite of what the Villain is trying to portray.\n\nNot to be confused with Anti-Villain, Badass at the Top, which has the hero being a good guy in spite of what he does, and Anti-Villain Protagonist who has no backstory at all; neither of those relate to this trope. Also not to be confused with Anti-Hero or with The Villain Was Right.\n\nNote that we could be talking about the wrong thing here, because not all villains are evil. This article only pertains to the villain being the protagonist. This isn't to say that any character, evil or not, is incapable of being a The Protagonist and he is not talking about any protagonists who are not actually heroic.\n\nExamples\n\nopen\/close all folders\n\nAnime & Manga\n\nComic Books\n\nComic Strips\n\nFan Works\n\nFilms \u2014 Animation\n\nZootopia: Most of the villains have one.

{"id":3899,"ended":false,"length":787,"gen_text":"You come across a room, locked from the outside. You hear a man's voice from inside, pleading for you to open it. But painted on the door reads `` Never open ''. What would you do? If the room is not locked, who can open it? Is it really safe to make such a statement? What if you are the security guard? Will the police help you? What if the robber is armed and waiting for you? How do you feel before you finally make the decision to release the key? Does it lead to feelings of joy or triumph? What if it is only a door? Or do you have to open it? Does the thought of your own body and the potential damage it can do scare you? It can also feel dangerous, with your own life on the line, for your loved ones. Or does it feel like more freedom? Would you like to have your own body? Would you like to be immortal? Or would you rather be a part of some other being? What if, just to be safe, you have to commit crimes to prove you are serious? What if you are a part of a society that has a higher law than your own? This society might not have a set of laws that you recognize, but it is your responsibility to obey it. Is your society the one to give you the power to do whatever you please (such as kill people)? You then will either choose evil or be forced to. You can go this way: If you want to choose life, the choice is clear. Do you do it. Or live as a mindless zombie. Or stay alive and enjoy the experience like a tourist. Do whatever you want, as you wish; it will be your choice and you can stop at any point. In this case, there is nothing I should do; there is no reason to do anything at all; all the choices I am facing are my own and my right. No one else has to be involved. People will just admire the courage I displayed! I don't want to live like this. If I stay alive, I should be happy, but what if I could be happy living this way? Then, what would that mean for me? This way, I would have the freedom of the choices I make. I am not obligated to do anything, but I should have the freedom to do whatever. If I had those choices, I surely would choose life and I think I would make the right choices. But I can't do that. I have to take what I can get. So, with this, my choice is to either live a life of freedom, or death. I chose death. What does this say to you? When faced with a choice of life, what do you choose? Do you choose the life you want or just the one you've been given (not everything that is given to you, obviously, but enough for the simple survival of yourself, your family, and your community)? Do you let others decide what happens to you and how you are brought into new lives? You might be forced by others to do things that you think you don't want or you will have to submit to being taken from your loved ones. What do you think about the person's life when you see it? What do you think about the \"good\" in it? Do you see your own life as a bad thing because your loved ones chose it for you, when you will be forced by them to turn down the possibilities of life or suffer it on their account? Do you realize that there are good qualities you will have to suffer for to have them? That you are in some way contributing to the life of others? Are you okay with it? If you're forced to live a life you do not want, or one that you can't live by any means, what do you think it says to

{"id":3192,"ended":true,"length":748,"gen_text":"A world in which cannibalism is considered as normal as eating vegetables or chicken, where it is considered in the same way as drinking green tea, drinking milk, eating eggs, eating cheese, eating fish, eating anything edible\u2026\n\n\u2026I have no doubt that it would be possible to change people's hearts and minds using these ideas. This is a world after all and when the people see all this happening they would be more likely to allow us to eat each other.\n\nWe're not trying to change the world we're just trying to save it.\n\nIn the US, I met with the American Federation of Association for Research in Social Psychology last week. This organization represents an estimated 80,000 member research psychologists who provide empirical research to support the professional development opportunities in psychology. One of their tasks is to advise the U.S. Federal Government, the Congress, the President, and other government entities on research in social psychology and the use of psychological science to promote social and political change.\n\nWhile there may be some difference in how psychologists interpret and use the scientific method, they have a set of shared beliefs about what it means to do science (among other things, these beliefs are summarized in the American Psychological Association's statement: The Scientific Method: A Scientific Definition and Assessment).\n\nOne of our biggest concerns is that these shared beliefs are leading to research practices and conclusions that we think are scientifically invalid. It makes perfect sense because if psychologists can't be clear about what is appropriate and what is not, it will be extremely difficult to tell psychology research projects that are using psychology research if they are, in fact, the result of professional psychology research. When psychologists can't clearly define what is and is not a good research strategy, their conclusions are necessarily subject to significant dispute and could even lead to professional harm.\n\nThe AAAS presented to the AAAS for the first time ever over the last two days our concerns about how this new science is affecting the science of psychological methods.\n\nThe scientists we spoke to shared a series of experiences over the past few years where their scientific discoveries contradicted established practices of their profession.\n\nThey shared stories of how their research was used without their permission, by researchers who had never previously been interviewed before, or by researchers who had obtained their written consent for conducting research, yet still failed to follow accepted research practices such as random assignment and proper statistical tests.\n\nIn numerous cases, scientists spoke about how they, as individuals, found it difficult to work with this new research practices that they were so used to seeing in their own scientific fields. It really makes sense that this would be the case for any professional psychology experimenter.\n\nPerhaps even more alarming is how this new research is also leading to many psychologists losing respect for the value of their own work.\n\nMany psychologists now use non-scientific methods to learn about human behavior that no scientific experiment could ever replicate. This research is not only flawed, it is also causing a great deal of pain in professional psychology. It also may be influencing political policy and policy makers.\n\nWith so much research coming out of psychology that's not properly replicated, it would be much harder to identify patterns in real-world behavior that would be helpful in predicting the future (or identifying new behaviors to predict). In other words, when psychologists can no longer reliably predict the future, it would be much harder to support policy decisions.\n\n\nIt's important to remember that we are not asking to be fired or banned or anything like that. We're just trying to show the APA that the most accepted scientific research methods in psychology should be applied to the current science of psychology experiments, not used for purposes that were not the authors' intentions.\n\nIf our concerns are not adequately addressed and addressed quickly, we may lose more than our confidence in our profession. And then perhaps we will be able to change the world.","token_len":790,"entropy":[7.9966,2.9204,0.305,10.924,0.0487,0.6627,3.6981,4.1982,1.9306,0.9058,1.0351,4.6558,2.453,6.4371,1.5129,2.8383,3.3136,0.3835,2.3146,5.7086,1.7977,0.1058,1.1884,0.1423,3.0709,5.287,0.2555,0.943,3.8372,2.6345,0.5896,1.4573,2.8374,0.5452,1.4127,2.9112,0.4308,0.9495,2.9595,0.4108,0.7565,4.8174,4.2118,4.2504,1.8544,0.0192,3.8019,3.7536,3.4331,1.6752,2.5059,0.3856,2.8797,1.5454,0.721,2.7697,0.532,4.9599,2.7602,0.0494,4.1952,0.807,0.1971,6.1342,3.1464,3.8263,0.5599,4.1668,0.6543,2.2933,2.1451,7.7225,0.1115,5.8898,5.4377,2.6489,2.7832,4.0277,4.7186,1.8003,3.7123,2.1881,1.2116,1.8827,3.2668,1.7487,0.0176,5.3189,3.7638,0.1378,3.9881,3.6924,0.0169,0.8739,0.762,0.0001,4.2549,3.9194,1.6346,3.869,0.0121,2.7411,1.2413,0.6584,4.9327,0.5814,0.8819,0.5493,0.0107,3.1801,1.2816,0.5336,0.793,0.0001,4.0373,1.3278,5.5016,1.1531,4.9003,4.4704,2.3666,2.0791,3.7887,4.0291,0.1549,5.3476,0.931,3.6306,0.8227,6.6185,0.2943,4.9302,1.2987,1.1089,3.1852,2.5848,2.96,5.736,1.7345,3.6142,0.7571,0.0057,6.9849,3.7626,0.3526,2.6926,4.3653,4.5076,2.0874,1.3964,2.2106,1.4677,4.0797,3.4308,8.1356,3.1543,2.1203,0.5634,4.4046,0.1423,0.8466,5.1485,0.1815,0.157,3.7863,0.5136,4.3451,0.0023,0.0088,0.0105,4.1579,0.5272,3.4503,1.9467,3.2613,0.571,1.2428,1.287,0.6955,0.7555,1.872,1.6389,3.1827,0.5474,2.8797,4.6234,1.0469,0.0471,2.8873,2.6514,3.0552,0.0378,1.9062,2.718,1.419,2.9484,1.7951,2.0234,1.3525,0.7622,0.0817,0.6228,0.0002,4.8268,3.1109,4.3555,0.2451,1.7685,5.6981,1.5894,2.6419,3.6067,4.6407,3.054,1.4268,1.4137,3.2424,0.4544,0.6203,1.9946,2.7364,1.7312,5.4319,0.0265,2.0612,2.0826,1.8155,2.1478,2.7014,0.2733,0.0437,2.9154,1.5885,5.8607,5.15,0.8628,0.1668,2.2897,3.4802,0.6698,1.0173,2.9495,0.4528,0.652,2.1041,0.092,0.0238,0.2178,2.9782,5.1648,2.5959,1.3009,0.1112,1.9391,0.8386,3.6889,3.1809,2.1032,5.1653,0.8942,1.1638,0.0002,2.431,0.2844,5.4204,3.7669,1.664,0.6602,0.6737,2.7142,0.9115,0.0762,1.0351,4.3919,0.9355,4.2143,1.7082,2.9025,3.0845,0.1208,3.9184,2.6661,0.29,2.3104,2.4538,0.625,4.2249,5.0063,3.9853,0.0361,5.1155,2.4984,2.3474,3.131,0.6178,3.7807,6.6479,0.3955,0.6392,2.3415,5.8177,0.657,0.5073,0.432,0.2215,0.6373,2.9192,2.4267,0.3151,3.4672,0.1583,0.7841,4.157,6.1437,3.2784,3.01,2.1142,0.9821,5.2203,1.8646,2.5738,6.499,0.5238,0.4194,5.8513,0.5525,0.0329,0.0129,5.5214,2.5696,0.0015,6.3107,2.3396,0.3197,0.3823,5.2851,3.196,1.7978,0.0265,3.237,1.7012,0.8512,0.8841,1.3614,0.9085,0.001,2.5484,3.4761,2.2733,4.3645,0.2712,4.2045,4.1027,1.7947,5.6611,4.1258,0.0258,4.7326,5.3622,1.7796,5.1154,2.8266,2.625,0.0877,3.8601,5.9938,0.322,0.2606,0.0002,2.595,4.1399,0.5276,5.9809,3.362,0.8653,2.2694,0.228,5.4776,1.3917,0.182,0.0018,4.2384,7.1958,0.6361,1.7495,1.7519,0.9899,4.108,2.3395,0.5161,2.4777,4.594,3.8294,3.8764,1.0614,2.6079,1.1938,4.2933,0.7855,2.3034,5.5943,1.0475,2.1551,0.0002,2.0806,5.391,2.6705,0.8567,1.1302,3.6416,1.998,5.3017,0.002,4.4255,3.9929,0.1153,1.3986,1.3207,0.3004,2.417,2.0428,3.4089,5.7605,5.5959,4.98,4.0065,2.1069,2.0536,2.4038,0.2997,2.0703,0.0002,3.4027,1.4023,2.2283,0.7748,1.9186,1.8002,1.6206,1.593,2.1922,4.9434,0.8414,1.5034,1.1151,4.4713,2.9319,0.7903,1.8793,2.2787,4.073,2.4397,3.4556,3.8496,0.3659,1.566,2.0439,1.3987,0.4178,0.9347,6.3893,1.4664,5.2184,0.8566,2.0867,4.9744,2.0992,2.829,3.4184,3.3723,4.4233,0.0211,2.4496,3.0941,1.6287,0.7905,3.4428,0.0023,3.9804,1.4785,1.7143,4.085,1.7261,5.4109,0.1627,0.6703,0.0002,2.9477,6.8483,0.4665,0.289,3.6551,4.9918,0.9801,0.9209,1.2657,5.948,1.651,4.5777,0.2749,3.9156,1.3823,1.0432,0.0986,4.5001,0.3392,6.0932,0.3465,1.7175,4.2809,3.6476,1.9689,2.2307,4.5271,1.9272,0.0074,3.7424,0.6646,0.6964,1.266,3.6073,3.0335,0.2118,4.1704,6.9724,3.8188,1.8338,1.3042,2.4006,1.3333,0.6298,0.8462,0.02,3.9394,3.3815,2.9835,4.261,6.0089,0.9083,0.9792,0.8207,0.0002,5.3226,3.0724,0.0884,3.5354,1.1921,2.4021,2.3971,0.4873,1.3117,1.4683,4.3466,3.3326,0.2601,4.568,3.38,4.6196,3.9027,0.1952,1.2814,5.0244,0.1223,0.7217,0.8711,1.0792,0.3319,1.29,0.0002,3.115,0.9012,4.095,5.2917,5.2262,0.0988,2.2526,1.4326,1.0997,5.2958,0.4808,1.542,0.4875,3.0281,6.2355,4.1968,3.7651,1.3419,0.3556,1.1787,0.3876,2.5499,3.8159,1.2476,2.3253,1.9161,4.8472,0.7354,0.7745,0.6494,1.5532,3.7452,2.5017,1.8456,0.128,0.0019,3.7408,3.3773,4.514,0.5055,1.1963,3.516,4.3669,4.1045,0.8829,5.0343,6.1246,3.5821,1.7543,3.2391,1.6383,1.504,0.3796,0.0002,5.8388,3.0866,0.6417,3.787,3.887,0.3972,0.601,1.046,2.4064,4.2231,1.461,4.224,2.9923,0.5246,1.4123,4.1623,0.4771,5.4525,2.5881,0.8084,4.464,4.5207,1.3409,4.1257,1.235,0.1658,1.4809,1.6558,2.2316,1.486,3.3034,1.145,3.3317,1.9699,0.6373,5.0891,2.4798,4.3765,4.3757,3.6675,1.8078,3.894,1.4331,3.4669,1.3707,0.0094,0.0421,3.8607,1.7702,2.7674,2.8967,0.0014,3.6724,1.0761,1.0883,0.3452,0.5747,1.9955,2.246,0.363,1.4279,0.39,0.4508,5.137,1.7417,2.7693,1.7487,6.4013,0.0003,3.4396,0.9203,2.2129,0.1676,1.8903,0.1052,3.0838,1.2679,0.7023,2.832,2.6995,2.8857,5.5789,1.5593,2.411,3.7805,2.7258,0.5186,0.039,0.1439,0.6664,1.7696,1.024,1.5901,0.0048,5.3013,1.8097,5.8168,0.0626,0.7226,2.5483,5.

{"id":2751,"ended":false,"length":755,"gen_text":"There's no life under that hood, no face, no body ; nothing but a void, a name, and a sense of purpose.'I feel that in the way that somebody would feel who had been born to be a person of purpose. I have chosen the way of Death to follow, and that's the way it is.' When he speaks about Death, he is using these terms in a different way than his audience and the readers may.\n\nHe speaks on the nature of Death, he speaks of the absence of life, he speaks of death itself, he speaks of it as the death of all things, he talks of it as the death of the old and the way of the new, with a belief that all things come to an end, and we will know what it means when everything ends. Death has no heart, nor love nor any sort of joy in its nature but that it goes from being one and is nothing more. He talks of Death and its return as something we have to learn to live with, but ultimately the fact that Death is part of what is meant for us by the word 'death' will become clear as we examine the context of this quote.\n\nWe begin when we are very young, we learn to learn, to understand the world and each other, which will set us into the path to learning how to love, and what'death'really means, and what'life'is, and we will know the meaning of life itself in time.\n\nIn the end, we understand nothing. The meaning of life is yet to come.\n\nHis journey is about getting the truth about life from within, taking it as a gift from the universe, but only after he has learnt what it means to know.\n\nWe can see from the very beginning what the nature of Death is, Death is the death of all things. The fact that we have been allowed so many different types of death over history tells us that Death is something we should be very wary of when trying to understand the universe, life, or life in general.\n\nThis quote could help us not get frightened when we hear the words 'death' and 'life' used in any form or meaning. It also helps us understand Death, not as some demonic force but as a part of the fact that all things come to an end. We can think of a number of ways we may relate to Death, and many of these relate to our relationship to our parents.\n\nThese quotes, and those related to them, teach us not only what to believe, but also why we are believers if we try to take them at face value. How can we understand Death if we have not understood life itself? How can we understand all things if we have not experienced the universe?\n\nDeath can be both scary and beautiful, the way we relate to it could also help us to connect to how the universe, the universe, and everything in it works, helping us understand how Life in the universe works, and how we, ourselves, work in it.\n\nThe universe is designed to have Death, and yet it works to put us in situations where we can experience life itself, making it possible for us to love and experience the world in all it's glory, and Death is why life is to come. So we don't have to experience a world filled with death, we can see how life works from the inside. We can experience Life first hand.\n\nThe quote continues to explain how it works to know about Death ; with Death, Death is something we can learn to cope with, and yet it is also something we can learn how to enjoy. It's not something that will mean we are forever alone.\n\nEven the great man himself says that he has'the highest purpose ', and this will guide us through the next part of this

The real one would probably have said something like this:\n\nYou say\u2014\n\n\u2014 There is a man\u2014I do not know what he does\u2014\n\n\u2014 I do not know what he looks like\u2014\n\n\u2014 I have never seen him before\u2014\n\n\u2014 and he has not said a word to me\u2014\n\n\u2014 but we have taken to calling him Sherlock Holmes\u2014\n\n\u2014 so I think I know what I ought to call him\u2014SIR.\n\n\u2014 You should not try to be clever\u2014there is no use in pretending\u2014\n\n\u2014 He is a very odd old fellow\u2014\n\n\u2014 and very fond of the most absurd things\u2014\n\n\u2014 and he will prove a most unpleasant person to deal with....\n\n\u2014 I am sure we will both find that it is no use pretending\u2014as it seems to be\u2014\n\n\u2014 you ought to look at the facts and come out at last and tell us what you think\u2014SIR.\n\nWe have only to add a couple of words on our own, and we would have gotten along just as happily:\n\n\u2014 There is a man\u2014I do not know what he does\u2014\n\n\u2014 I do not know what he looks like\u2014\n\n\u2014 I have never seen him before\u2014\n\n\u2014 but we have taken to calling him Sherlock Holmes\u2014\n\n\u2014 so I think I know what I ought to call him\u2014Sir.\n\n\u2014 You should not try to be clever\u2014there is no use in pretending\u2014\n\n\u2014 He is a very odd old fellow\u2014\n\n\u2014 and very fond of the most absurd things\u2014\n\n\u2014 and he will prove a most unpleasant person to deal with.\n\nWe have to point out here that I do not think that the first of these examples represents real Sherlock Holmes writing. This first example is probably some version of the first Sherlock Holmes short story, The Adventure of the Empty House. The second is obviously Sherlock Holmes' actual writing of this short story (if it exists). The third is a very early version of the story.\n\nSo, it is perfectly possible that Sherlock Holmes wrote both of the examples above. However, I think that these examples are best represented by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes and the Sherlock Holmes Exposed, who wrote in the following vein:\n\nWell, he may be an eccentric, but he's certainly no genius. I never heard him pretend (as he often did himself), nor would he pretend if he wasn't perfectly confident that he was right and no one else was.\n\nHe was a quiet, reserved man (some people say \"soporific\" is a better word) whose opinions were often clouded by his own prejudices\u2014a quality which led him to an unusual mixture of interest and dislike in everything, which often brought even his closest friends to their knees (in his case, as he grew older).

{"id":1865,"ended":false,"length":785,"gen_text":"Satan suddenly appears in a crowded mall, and begins terrifying the holiday shoppers. He stops, looks directly at you and says, `` You... You're interesting. Do your friends know what you are? '' You have no idea what he means. You never asked him that in the first place. He then goes to work at the front desk of the mall, then he makes copies of Christmas cards to hand out to the customers. The next morning, your mother shows up on the front lawn, carrying a bag of groceries, and asks you and your friends to meet her at the front door. You look at each other uncomfortably and say, `` What is it that's bothering you, Mom? ` `` It must be your mother. You look confused and say, `` I don't know what she wants. If she's trying to get at us, please don't do it.` `` Your mother then shows up in another outfit ( with a long skirt, high heels, and a large coat ), but this time looks very different and is much more seductive. She starts to dance in a very provocative manner, then she bends over so you can see her breasts. She smiles seductively at you and says, `` I've got some really good news for you tonight. You won't have to go to your Christmas party tonight. I'm your Christmas tree.`` You look at her, embarrassed and then say ( in a flat voice ), `` Yes, Mom...You can put me on there.`` The next day, you find out that the next day the same thing has happened in your local mall. The two mall managers had to cancel the Christmas party due to the crazy behaviour of a demon possessed woman! You go to the mall to try to get your old friends back, the rest of your friends also avoid you, as they know that you are an occult expert. That night, Satan shows up again, in your local branch of Walgreens (same store), where he's selling candy. He is still wearing his mask and carries the same sack of candy. This time, he doesn't carry the candy, but he does put some money in your cash drawer, makes sure you have something to eat, then goes over to your mother and asks her something rather strange. He asks her, `` Are you getting tired? `` She says, `` Oh, no, not at all.`` The demon suddenly has some trouble with the wiring, and he is unable to make her go on the candy. Instead, he forces her to kiss him. He asks her, `` Will you go on her sugar high, my sweet? I would love to see you get into sugar highs,'' and so on. She gets into the sugar highs and after about 5 seconds of this, he says :`` Will you please take off that mask my sweet? I've been waiting for an opportunity to seduce you.'' She takes off the mask and the devil leaves your mom, embarrassed. As you leave the mall, the Devil sees you and turns back into a small guy in a coat, who starts to run ahead of you, screaming like a maniac. That night, you go out to your parents' house and sit down at the kitchen table to tell them the story. They tell you not to worry, that you'll be okay, and you are. By now, the Candy Man has become a popular man, and people come here to enjoy his candy. But a good number of the people in the mall are now worried about the person who was in there earlier, because they see him running around the mall like mad.

{"id":968,"ended":false,"length":785,"gen_text":"Satan suddenly appears in a crowded mall, and begins terrifying the holiday shoppers. He stops, looks directly at you and says, `` You... You're interesting. Do your friends know what you are? '' You have no idea what he means. You never asked him that in the first place. He then goes to work at the front desk of the mall, then he makes copies of Christmas cards to hand out to the customers. The next morning, your mother shows up on the front lawn, carrying a bag of groceries, and asks you and your friends to meet her at the front door. You look at each other uncomfortably and say, `` What is it that's bothering you, Mom? ` `` It must be your mother. You look confused and say, `` I don't know what she wants. If she's trying to get at us, please don't do it.` `` Your mother then shows up in another outfit ( with a long skirt, high heels, and a large coat ), but this time looks very different and is much more seductive. She starts to dance in a very provocative manner, then she bends over so you can see her breasts. She smiles seductively at you and says, `` I've got some really good news for you tonight. You won't have to go to your Christmas party tonight. I'm your Christmas tree.`` You look at her, embarrassed and then say ( in a flat voice ), `` Yes, Mom...You can put me on there.`` The next day, you find out that the next day the same thing has happened in your local mall. The two mall managers had to cancel the Christmas party due to the crazy behaviour of a demon possessed woman! You go to the mall to try to get your old friends back, the rest of your friends also avoid you, as they know that you are an occult expert. That night, Satan shows up again, in your local branch of Walgreens (same store), where he's selling candy. He is still wearing his mask and carries the same sack of candy. This time, he doesn't carry the candy, but he does put some money in your cash drawer, makes sure you have something to eat, then goes over to your mother and asks her something rather strange. He asks her, `` Are you getting tired? `` She says, `` Oh, no, not at all.`` The demon suddenly has some trouble with the wiring, and he is unable to make her go on the candy. Instead, he forces her to kiss him. He asks her, `` Will you go on her sugar high, my sweet? I would love to see you get into sugar highs,'' and so on. She gets into the sugar highs and after about 5 seconds of this, he says :`` Will you please take off that mask my sweet? I've been waiting for an opportunity to seduce you.'' She takes off the mask and the devil leaves your mom, embarrassed. As you leave the mall, the Devil sees you and turns back into a small guy in a coat, who starts to run ahead of you, screaming like a maniac. That night, you go out to your parents' house and sit down at the kitchen table to tell them the story. They tell you not to worry, that you'll be okay, and you are. By now, the Candy Man has become a popular man, and people come here to enjoy his candy. But a good number of the people in the mall are now worried about the person who was in there earlier, because they see him running around the mall like mad. But Satan shows up again, with a bag of candy in his hand, and he makes another move... But it seems that the candy doesn't work on him anymore. So, as soon as you go back home, you take the mask off of Satan and you have the surprise of your

{"id":2400,"ended":true,"length":732,"gen_text":"The worst salesman in the world tries to sell you the best thing in the world... but it doesn't work. The product or service doesn't work because it doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm also an amateur neuroscientist, and that's where I think this all falls apart. Here are the main lessons from neuroscience.\n\nThere are no simple answers and no one answer.\n\nIt is a very good idea to be clear about what science can give you but no one answer is right or wrong. The problem is you will use all your available data to support your favorite scientific theory and none of it will be accurate.\n\nYou will learn the exact things that you need to know to do research.\n\nEveryone learns differently, and you will do it differently. One person with little experience doing research can learn it in days while another person can take years.\n\nYou won't get to an answer.\n\nYour brain will try to make things simple by answering questions like... \"how do I make things simple?\"\n\nWhile it will try not to make things complex, like...\n\n\"how do I use this information to make a better decision?\"\n\nI'm all about making better decisions. (Hint: the way you think will reveal the best way to use the information.) If you don't know how to make those decisions yourself you will always make bad decisions.\n\nWhen you can't get clear, understand or make a decision then it gets harder to solve.\n\nThis is why you will waste time trying to make decisions yourself, then spend time trying not to make decisions you don't understand. It gets harder and harder to know. One person can do all their research in a day while another person needs to think for weeks, months or years.\n\nIf you read all that, then congratulations, you will now know what you need to know. There is one answer and only one. And it may not be an answer that will work.\n\nNow that you want to do research...\n\n... the big question is, how do we pick a research approach.\n\nThis is important because people with lots of free time can do everything. But if you only have research tasks that are important to you, that you can make the effort to do, then...\n\n\u2026 you can't do it.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nBecause you need some time to think about this question. Once you have the answer then you don't have to think about it. It makes sense and you don't care anymore. You need to get the answer to this question before all your other tasks become interesting (not that that's easy).\n\nMy approach is also based on the idea that you can't learn anything new by doing research. You need learning new information to learn new ways to do a task.\n\nLet me be clear \u2013 this information is very important, but research questions don't help you find answers.\n\nThe key is to research things that matter.\n\nA final thought...\n\nI'll conclude with a personal anecdote...\n\nI learned the same thing when I was an academic (at UC Davis).\n\nA student wrote to a good journal asking to publish a paper on how to use a website as a database. I wrote back an article explaining why we didn't want to publish it because...\n\nThe results were not statistically significant...\n\nIt made no sense.\n\nThat student never saw my email.\n\nTo make it even worse, I never saw the paper. I read the authors' letters and I saw all the words I hadn't written and I was like...\n\n...

{"id":644,"ended":true,"length":740,"gen_text":"Aliens are studying Earth and determine that Humans have 1 God and that that God is a clock.\n\nGod has a date for humans to kill him, and the Aliens sent a message because they know that humans cannot kill him.\n\nThe message is actually an alien's mind, not a message from aliens but a mind with memories.\n\nGod was once called God before his coming and is the only god.\n\nGod is the main reason for war and death. God and Aliens both exist.\n\nGod created humans after being bored by other gods so that humans would have a better time. God also created humans on Earth for the sole purpose of dying, with humans being the prime example. If any one of you says they know God doesn't exist, please stop reading the book and come into the show with us!\n\nGod can't change time, or move it. God can only be seen with his eyes and not in a dream. A mind is a mind, so God is the closest thing there is to a person, or at least he would be if there were such.\n\nHumans are a mistake from God.\n\nGod is angry at us. He is angry because he hates us and because humans have caused war. The War will stop when God decides to start it again.\n\nThe \"war\" we are fighting was God trying to find out more about Earth and life. God had a few billion people on Earth and could never live as they did. They used that life as an experiment. But for whatever reason, God decided that humans were the bad ones, so he decided to wipe them out by sending a virus virus on our planet, which turned them into monsters with an army. One of the humans was born very very ugly and used to hunt animals that didn't do anything to her except eat. Her name was Mira. A young boy named Kouta was her best friend.\n\nMira's mother was never even raised, so she's still an evil freak. However, she did have something that God didn't want: A baby at home. Kouta made some friends and gave the baby a name: Chidori.\n\nGod created people with the sole purpose of killing them. When humans began to do anything, God became sick at heart and killed all of them, except for one, Mira. They had to live together together for a while until Mira decided to kill herself. This made Kouta angry, so he killed her in revenge for her death.\n\n. They had to live together together for a while until Mira decided to kill herself. This made Kouta angry, so he killed her in revenge for her death. God hates humans and created Humans to exterminate them. Humans are responsible for the entire Earth being turned into a hell-hole. This is the reason for the War, and also humans' existence in general. Humans are the worst. Humans are also causing wars and killing each other.\n\nGod is also dying as he was bored and wanted to learn more (maybe he's still bored and wants to learn more)\n\nGod is also slowly dying of boredom and no longer has the will to destroy anything, so he kills animals for fun to fill his boredom.\n\nGod is actually a good guy in the end, just a very bored one who decided to try to prove to humanity that not everything is bad. This also explains why he lets humans live even though there is little to no need for them.

{"id":2664,"ended":true,"length":759,"gen_text":"30 % of the world's population die and come back as a mythological being of their choosing.\n\nHowever, that idea is almost universally opposed and ridiculed. The popular response to this fact is 'they're all from the same country and we're all from earth'. There are probably a couple of reasons for this.\n\nOne is that most people believe that humans are all descended from one giant mother - a common idea in pre-industrial society, and still very popular. However, it actually happens to be completely untrue. We have no one common ancestor with the other living species of earth, the dinosaurs, the pterosaurs, and the birds. We're all unique organisms, the same as we are for all the other life on the planet.\n\nWhat's more, the idea that our species was some kind of evolutionary accident is entirely false. The evidence goes against it - and is overwhelmingly supporting.\n\nI can think of many reasons why modern people would say that humanity is so weird that it's all the work of a mythical monster, not a supernatural being. For example, there's not many religions which claim to be from heaven. Most people would say that if you were from heaven, your origin story wouldn't be 'I came from this planet which was so exotic that it only became known to other earthlings a short time before we were born'. The mythological explanation for why we're here would be the same - it makes perfect sense.\n\nIn fact as far as we know, that's just what happened. The human lineage is very young, and in many ways very strange. So it's unlikely that our myths would tell us everything we need to know, as they would tell us that we came from another planet, when all the evidence we've got suggests that isn't true.\n\nThe next obvious answer is that some people think we all came from an ancient flood, but that notion is almost entirely out of step with reality. For one thing, it's very unlikely that the Flood actually happened. Most experts believe that the Earth's crust, oceans, and atmospheric chemistry at that time must have been different enough from today's that a major flood isn't possible.\n\nFinally, you might think that some people think we came from a mythological creature from another planet. If that's true, you'd probably expect that the world's population would be very diverse and many different kinds of people would have evolved. As far as we know, it's actually very rare for a new creature to emerge in the world.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about this, have a look at How many different Earth-like planets have there been? and The evidence that the earth is not just a globe.\n\nSo what's the deal? Is the world populated by mythological beings real? Well, if most of modern society accepts that they exist, then it's no surprise - and if you reject that they really do exist, the argument simply won't work.\n\nFor example, don't expect many people to believe in a world filled with dinosaurs, or a world in which most members of the human family are descended from one large alien mother. People who think these are real stories will just see them as things that have no meaning or purpose.\n\nThe same thing goes for any religious beliefs which suggest the world is populated by mythological creatures from another planet or the stars. They might not find the idea very compelling, but it's unlikely that they'd be ready to give up their religions completely in the face of evidence to the contrary.\n\nIn summary, the average person sees an extraordinary series of coincidences happening each day, and the explanation for why that's happening seems quite obvious. Yet, most people reject the existence of any extraordinary events at all. As we will see, most people who reject the existence of the supernatural are just waiting to be convinced one day.","token_len":795,"entropy":[7.5343,2.7251,1.2452,5.7361,0.3005,1.1161,6.9933,5.3469,5.9153,0.2238,1.5413,3.8361,10.6392,1.1124,3.0712,3.9374,5.9239,5.0599,0.6422,1.681,0.0169,5.2784,0.1143,4.3542,6.3779,1.1865,5.5146,3.7012,5.0171,3.4651,2.955,1.469,2.446,5.3769,4.0888,0.9624,1.615,5.8559,0.3982,5.7268,4.9345,1.6675,3.24,5.487,1.5141,0.6975,4.8747,3.3483,3.3571,1.632,0.1926,1.5133,5.1655,1.1214,4.2722,1.0766,5.5232,1.852,2.5055,0.2066,1.0796,0.2075,0.1558,0.9548,1.7256,0.0002,2.3232,0.6653,0.4803,3.0891,0.7489,3.0253,0.8104,4.1537,1.0641,2.7634,2.761,0.0092,1.6662,5.0324,4.8417,6.1765,2.7872,1.4413,3.2667,1.3049,4.234,0.5758,3.4283,3.4606,2.4325,1.8639,3.8923,3.3016,1.5205,2.9775,3.1607,0.0622,3.0117,6.1887,5.7653,2.2087,0.0871,3.1258,1.5597,0.3602,3.3002,2.9732,2.519,4.5097,1.9726,0.2005,3.4511,1.3479,2.4238,2.7982,0.9305,2.1498,3.8129,1.4046,4.2152,3.2977,2.0376,1.9022,2.6456,0.0521,0.4451,0.3654,2.4574,0.6314,4.6396,0.4053,2.1338,1.8304,0.6759,3.2341,5.2085,1.3024,4.4686,1.9248,0.8039,3.0618,0.3026,3.2498,1.4983,1.5174,0.5122,2.3469,0.7392,1.5529,0.2414,0.23,0.8544,0.0002,4.7103,1.5475,0.2397,0.1063,1.7274,1.3821,0.4046,3.7336,1.4148,3.4253,5.665,1.1152,0.0024,4.2581,1.9348,0.9576,5.5062,1.8815,0.2554,2.112,3.3625,6.2897,1.7202,0.7099,2.6033,3.8536,3.8494,4.2094,5.7075,1.8983,1.2163,0.0002,4.9857,3.8502,2.6113,0.0048,2.7614,1.9447,0.3404,5.9094,1.5836,2.5242,5.1169,0.8654,5.5231,0.729,4.6125,5.8329,2.1595,0.9912,1.4389,2.736,1.9142,2.3729,0.0028,1.7835,5.0502,4.1488,1.6843,4.2533,1.8142,4.5323,1.77,0.5422,3.2448,0.8429,0.2053,2.7904,1.0403,5.5752,3.8478,4.0652,2.3327,3.9142,1.1741,0.7529,3.1953,2.1197,1.7599,2.8292,1.7561,2.0,1.5757,0.3283,2.6845,1.7883,2.4782,2.2539,0.2509,0.5443,4.4877,5.7676,0.7999,2.8808,0.0003,0.537,2.6123,0.907,2.3498,0.4338,3.4145,1.1033,5.091,1.6354,3.4324,5.5457,0.8493,1.1949,5.0255,4.152,3.7267,0.696,2.6808,3.7552,0.1891,2.8618,3.0372,0.1633,1.8822,3.2347,1.8496,0.3168,0.5998,3.7978,3.8489,0.2645,2.5179,1.7881,2.0825,0.99,0.795,0.5972,2.2839,0.4732,3.8639,2.7515,2.6033,2.1845,4.9924,3.0993,0.0906,1.0937,0.2891,0.0002,3.9067,1.3277,8.9474,1.8554,0.1306,1.7094,0.599,0.2638,5.0737,0.4315,3.6098,1.5493,1.0305,0.2836,1.7967,5.1045,4.0916,2.3485,3.7276,3.427,0.9477,0.8896,4.6605,2.3968,0.6214,1.9554,2.2342,0.2899,4.051,1.977,0.9122,4.6684,0.1293,2.4155,5.6625,3.1018,4.6405,0.1216,3.347,0.8933,0.4563,0.0161,0.0325,3.2412,4.0406,1.9688,1.7283,4.7192,0.2005,2.3051,0.6968,2.0726,0.1588,2.3861,0.258,1.7387,2.6299,3.3339,0.9236,0.1541,4.4456,2.8998,0.5426,1.0307,0.5009,5.6258,0.0006,0.8916,0.0915,0.3488,0.0002,2.2908,4.1894,3.9789,2.8861,0.4761,0.4082,4.3711,0.8127,2.9123,2.2521,3.658,1.0053,0.039,3.5219,2.2739,5.1671,1.0991,1.7094,1.2298,6.6435,0.5676,3.9268,3.0396,5.8393,0.197,3.0005,0.0095,2.8106,0.1477,3.5658,1.295,0.0909,0.0486,2.3758,0.7379,3.0857,0.9425,0.2505,1.8044,5.4478,2.7654,0.2316,0.8306,4.087,3.8198,1.7913,0.384,1.1944,2.5324,2.3877,2.4729,4.5053,2.206,0.4779,0.4496,5.1816,2.7312,4.7164,1.8954,0.0647,4.0964,0.0761,0.1377,3.3453,1.3215,1.0197,0.8806,0.5368,1.8583,2.2434,3.525,1.0906,5.4741,0.0005,1.6302,0.1673,0.8926,0.0002,5.8736,0.1104,5.2931,1.3857,1.2372,0.1669,2.8676,0.3365,1.0489,1.0279,1.3191,0.0172,1.5894,4.1991,0.0754,1.7036,3.2188,0.8139,0.261,1.6433,4.4052,1.2669,0.6679,1.2222,0.1207,2.5774,0.9542,3.8417,0.6739,1.5561,2.0429,5.1827,0.7684,2.2869,0.5536,0.5814,2.7468,2.9156,2.5717,4.5247,0.9588,3.3414,0.0413,1.7775,0.7762,0.9351,2.7476,1.2291,4.94,2.7306,0.007,0.3613,0.1621,0.1295,2.3926,0.6147,4.2865,1.4679,0.7077,1.0859,1.9962,4.587,3.6445,0.0856,2.4514,2.5081,1.0423,1.9957,1.4483,1.4846,0.0002,3.3785,0.8741,5.2163,2.984,0.0807,1.1344,0.0374,0.2072,2.1453,1.8008,4.8819,0.0105,0.0667,0.0493,4.9096,2.7519,1.967,4.956,2.413,1.3814,0.0627,2.2212,1.0008,0.126,0.1653,2.1623,2.3635,4.9515,1.7071,2.48,2.5275,0.4087,0.6978,4.5144,1.5585,3.8995,0.683,0.6656,0.0002,3.4781,2.1726,1.3303,0.5309,2.662,1.0179,2.2663,2.1298,1.7157,2.3689,0.2454,2.422,0.0449,0.7237,6.7575,0.7434,3.3643,0.2697,3.1065,5.4735,2.0666,5.5399,1.2788,2.6422,0.8434,2.776,2.9943,0.1863,0.6568,2.2977,0.8618,5.0115,0.86,5.1418,2.3856,2.6029,1.904,5.2863,1.1205,2.0847,3.7589,0.7301,0.247,0.151,4.3321,4.5618,4.9771,3.933,0.0006,0.6196,0.1282,0.7519,0.0002,3.6517,2.9431,0.0305,5.8305,0.0011,3.1463,3.1081,0.9337,0.1489,1.7599,1.6798,1.7864,3.4061,2.9313,0.0376,3.4844,1.7606,1.9918,1.6813,1.1422,3.9655,0.0326,4.9279,7.0791,0.0704,0.8841,0.7734,3.3845,1.0332,0.9199,0.0058,2.128,5.2193,5.5862,0.6854,0.2657,3.8682,2.674,2.5366,2.8494,3.6429,2.2499,4.3545,1.6073,3.0564,4.163,0.9655,0.0573,5.0719,0.7242,3.0452,1.6253,3.2084,2.3515,3.577,1.0553,0.73,0.0002,2.8806,2.4175,2.6695,1.3777,0.1626,3.3506,4.5805,2.1932,2.2428,3.9482,3.5698,0.736,0.3762,1.0261,0.1672,2.6071,0.0062,1.8836,3.9451,0.5042,0.1055,3.7383,3.2298,1.942,0.1432,3.4221,3.9792,3.178,5.5657,2.8474,0.4532,2.0942,3.3141,0.3039,0.4298,2.3216,0.7177,2.0603,0.5997,0.859,1.724,1.9555,5.0559,0.0233,2.66,0.2815,0.7785,4.0603,4.7071,3.5685,1.4809,0.0717,0.0029,

{"id":2125,"ended":false,"length":654,"gen_text":"We've explored more of the lunar surface than the bottom of the ocean. NASA knows what's down there, and it trying to get us off Earth as fast as possible. 't' hings like this really make you wonder who the folks at NASA really work for. In short, it makes you wonder how we got to't to the stage we are today as a species. Here are the 'fittest astronauts' right now.\n\nThe Top 3 Best Astronaut Training\n\nThese are the astronauts that have gone on to fly NASA's Space shuttle, and the International Space Station. And these are the astronauts that will leave the space station in 2018!\n\n1) Kjell Lindgren\n\n\nKjell Lindgren was the first of the 'fittest astronauts' on the Space Shuttle, and the first ever to fly into space, in 1991. Lindgren's journey wasn't a smooth one, as he underwent severe and long-term medical problems on his way to space, as he also had to endure a massive weight loss while his friends at NASA kept him in good physical shape.\n\n\nIt wasn't long before he was declared'The fittest astronaut ever to live'after completing his 2,000th spacewalk.\n\n\nKjell flew through the STS-61 mission which was so important to NASA that it had to be re-planned several times.\n\n\nLindgren then went on to become the first person to ever walk the moon.\n\n\nIn 1994, he returned to the Space Station, and became the first person to walk around it twice.\n\n\nLindgren was declared'The fittest astronaut ever to live'after completing his 2,000th spacewalk, and in 2007, he returned to walk around his own body.\n\n\n2) Chris Hadfield\n\n\nChris Hadfield is one of the'Fittest Astronaut'on the International Space Station, for sure.\n\n\nWhile Chris was busy aboard the ISS, he also went on to become the first person to walk around the moon during his first mission using an EVA. During his first EVA he set a world record for walking the outside of the moon and back.\n\n\nAfter getting back to earth, Hadfield went on to become the first Canadian in space, aboard the space shuttle Columbia.\n\n\nEven though Hadfield isn't living yet, he has the world's fattest body, and is living now aboard the ISS.\n\n\nIf you are going to be flying space shuttles anytime soon, it's better to make sure that you have Chris Hadfield on your hands, as that will definitely keep your blood pressure from skyrocketing :).\n\n\n3) Dave Scott\n\n\nDave Scott is one of the'Fittest Astronauts'on the International Space Station, making sure that the people aboard the station, have a healthy and happy life.\n\n\nHe was the captain of the'International Space Station ', and he's also the first Canadian astronaut to fly to space. He served as the station'Command Module Pilot'during his time on the ISS, and he became the first person to ever reach two orbit's above Earth!\n\n\nHe's also been in space two other times, as a pilot and as an astronaut.\n\n\nHe was the first astronaut to ever work side-by-side with the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.\n\n\nHe was in orbit for just an hour, on the first mission to the ISS.

{"id":774,"ended":true,"length":732,"gen_text":"Take your greatest fear and write your absolute worst nightmare... and if that doesn't get you moving, then put the barstool down because nobody deserves to make it to the top of this ridiculous system.\n\n5. I'm not a part of America's elite.\n\nDon't let anyone tell you you're not great because you're not in the big leagues. America is the greatest country in the world, and that's just the way we're made.\n\n6. The rich will always get richer, and the middle class will always be screwed.\n\nThe top 1\/10th of 1 percent will own twice as much wealth as the top 90 percent by 2013. As a result, 99 percent of Americans will have less wealth than they do today.\n\nThis is a massive change in the distribution of wealth and income since the end of World War II, an era in which the 90 percent shared about 3 percent of total household income. This massive wealth gap is what caused the Great Recession.\n\n7. A vote for Obama is a vote to pay for the wars.\n\nWe paid $5.1 trillion for the war in Iraq, more than the entire cost of Social Security for the last 40 years. We now have $13.9 trillion dollars invested in the military-industrial complex, and we need more.\n\nBy contrast, Mitt Romney has said we should cut defense spending by $2.5 trillion.\n\n8. The United States will cease to be a free society.\n\nAmericans are slowly being dragged back toward old-fashioned totalitarianism under President Barack Obama.\n\nWe live in what I call a \"captured democracy,\" which means the government is increasingly being run by corporate oligarchs who are taking over national government. No longer are you elected by you or your elected representatives, but by the 1 percent. In other words, instead of the people having a say in what happens in their government, the people have a say in what happens to their taxes.\n\n9. We are at a crossroads in the history of Western civilization.\n\nIt's time for President Obama to do the right thing, not the politically correct thing, and turn us around and start protecting our borders. If you value your right to keep and bear arms, now's the time to speak out and support candidates who advocate for Second Amendment rights. If you value your Christian religion, now's the time to stand up for people of faith against unjust persecution. And if you value your freedom and your prosperity, now's the time to vote for candidates who promise to put you back in charge of your own political destiny.\n\n10. America is weak, and Obama isn't strong.\n\nObama promised to continue \"leading from behind,\" but he hasn't done much. Instead, the Obama regime has been the world's leading terrorist force since 9\/11. The president has also undermined U.S. allies, such as Syria in their fight against terrorists, Iran in their efforts at national energy independence (including nuclear energy), and Cuba in their fight against the United States.\n\n11. If it weren't for Obama, I would be in a prison cell right now.\n\nAs a federal inmate, I can testify that a vote for Barack Obama is a vote for indefinite imprisonment. If I could see the White House, I also would hope there were no cameras in the room, because I know very well where they sit.\n\nI am writing as an American patriot, just like George Washington, who warned our Founders that an irresponsible government can lead us to our grave with great threats of our own. Barack Obama is not my president, and he will not lead me to victory or liberty.\n\n\u2014\n\nThis commentary by Steve Kimel (a.k.a.
