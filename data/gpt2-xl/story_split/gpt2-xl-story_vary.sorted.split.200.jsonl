Bibi, the eldest, is a charming and innocent woman, but she quickly reveals that she is really a dark and twisted soul. During your game with her, she will go on increasingly dark and murderous deeds and at one point even makes a reference to her previous murders in your room. She has one more trick up her sleeve which will drive you mad! After you have met with her on a number of occassions, with your relationship with her at a low level, your love life will soon be a nightmare! One can only hope that you manage to save Bibi from the evil that lurks within her!","token_len":200,"entropy":[9.2776,4.1616,8.1219,6.1271,5.7362,2.7903,2.0191,2.4923,4.6554,0.605,4.8273,0.0018,1.4254,6.7426,3.8486,0.8568,0.9657,5.2591,1.8631,2.2925,4.3853,0.3409,0.7219,2.0843,5.5139,0.8377,0.3461,2.1407,2.9196,0.6419,0.2468,3.361,0.9844,0.8993,1.3538,6.139,2.2654,2.0558,0.0598,2.565,2.5578,0.3863,0.1479,0.6284,3.4755,2.786,4.4602,4.6837,3.4157,1.3057,4.1436,2.4188,0.7941,0.6133,0.7548,4.5684,5.8142,2.3342,6.5613,0.9759,5.9998,0.0886,0.0259,0.0883,2.2757,4.8391,3.3358,0.4333,0.7395,2.3436,2.1521,2.0989,4.7413,0.6206,4.349,0.0087,3.1065,1.8259,1.7979,0.4889,0.8626,1.794,4.6181,1.6077,3.6584,3.5972,1.7843,1.0314,1.6544,4.9465,3.8425,1.4865,0.3197,0.6077,5.0278,1.098,4.9863,1.0948,1.9891,4.2338,1.0353,6.3979,2.2374,6.2751,2.4091,0.773,0.8699,1.8125,2.1784,5.1972,1.264,5.8687,2.5475,0.2471,4.6029,3.807,2.8121,4.9095,1.2535,0.0307,2.7398,4.5436,1.3771,4.0847,0.0184,2.1944,4.31,2.481,2.5717,3.867,4.0854,0.4222,2.7249,3.3923,4.05,3.0732,0.9865,0.0664,0.0024,0.0641,4.1558,1.8376,5.3352,0.2557,1.7885,3.2615,5.214,1.6088,1.274,4.88,2.347,1.0952,4.9728,2.6118,0.8146,0.0027,4.126,0.0882,0.0004,0.5754,7.3774,2.8978,6.0608,1.1136,0.2206,2.161,1.5362,1.6779,3.2047,0.3767,4.7096,5.7331,2.6865,0.8792,4.8318,1.4866,3.8497,3.1552,1.4009,5.9073,4.9482,0.2771,0.4386,0.3024,1.0944,3.4928,0.0195,2.404,2.5325,0.0004,1.1991,1.8679,2.8649,1.4533,1.4916,0.0035,1.1711,0.2366,2.1728]}

The story begins in a strange place with a mysterious pony who is an immortal and has the ability to bring in ponies from the afterlife as pets and protect them from the evil.\nWith this dark approach of MLP, I think it's interesting to see this series going on in such darkness and with this theme. However, it feels forced and the story was slow to get going. The story feels so short, with one thing to look forward to; a mystery on the next episode. Although, the ending with a nice twist on what happened to our MC made it more than worth the wait, although I can't say the same for the ending theme song. The story is fun, but it's really the mystery and the end that makes it feel epic.I can't say this was a complete waste of my time, however.","token_len":200,"entropy":[11.0725,8.7112,0.0899,3.5529,11.9525,3.9719,3.5405,6.1261,3.4877,0.5487,7.9608,0.2075,2.7429,2.7156,1.4565,5.3136,6.9177,1.4997,3.7932,4.9512,1.6355,5.125,5.396,1.3691,1.9079,5.0501,5.9005,3.6808,1.9802,0.1376,1.8431,2.5196,1.7203,4.3332,1.8258,1.0185,5.2824,2.1914,2.4294,1.2001,2.8312,2.1272,2.4751,2.066,4.6823,4.1226,2.1457,2.6843,2.0556,1.4024,0.0427,3.734,4.5399,4.6265,0.8958,1.3532,3.4004,4.5674,4.3169,2.4077,3.8228,0.3287,1.0725,1.487,2.4196,2.7039,2.5976,8.0762,2.1974,5.5574,5.2384,3.9989,6.4794,0.0231,1.0511,1.5394,2.2923,1.196,1.6194,3.9321,0.6418,1.5354,3.8608,3.8138,4.29,2.6969,2.2444,2.9718,6.3685,2.1557,2.7598,3.1255,3.7248,1.2924,4.5771,0.1666,2.3999,5.1123,5.9512,1.2883,3.537,1.377,4.7571,4.5831,1.5489,1.4119,0.8827,0.7216,1.984,1.601,4.7631,4.6186,4.08,1.7151,3.7197,4.3774,5.534,2.9867,3.9758,0.0846,0.2875,5.7461,1.6685,4.7005,5.5543,1.0019,3.7088,1.5678,0.4083,5.2074,1.5438,1.6745,3.0821,6.0911,2.1219,3.8866,2.3141,2.7432,3.2531,1.9751,2.0244,4.7115,5.4892,3.5167,1.4647,3.5189,2.1082,0.4721,0.7234,1.6055,3.2412,3.7078,1.2514,3.7994,0.42,1.8319,2.244,2.1791,0.5633,0.3021,2.7231,4.4526,1.9195,0.5273,2.6601,2.4646,1.7838,4.9737,1.1871,0.6606,1.7402,1.6502,3.9754,3.9446,1.96,1.5779,0.9206,4.7479,0.6571,1.6946,0.9836,3.5262,4.9923,0.5653,4.2791,3.7546,0.5746,1.1186,2.3958,2.6048,0.9517,4.7634,0.7781,0.2319,1.4526,0.0472,0.7562,3.765,1.564]}

NPR's Ira Glass: Your radio show might soon have nothing but Ira Glass-singing clones.\n\nThe NPR hosts of This American Life report that they have been hacked, and that Ira is trying to destroy them. In the episode, host Ira Glass goes to an NPR-branded bar with one of his alter egos; he pretends to be intoxicated, and says that he'll be there the whole time. If you want more Ira Glass, you can catch more shows with Ira Glass on This American Life, or listen to Ira's episodes for Serial, On the Media, and the new Ira & Mike.","token_len":203,"entropy":[4.2941,8.8012,11.5774,7.5404,3.0768,1.5779,2.3449,6.0327,0.0991,4.4088,5.8093,5.8671,5.0718,2.9611,0.3689,4.3505,0.0031,0.8522,5.5167,8.3705,0.288,0.662,0.6784,3.5452,0.4221,7.001,0.3871,1.4885,7.3968,1.0283,0.7445,2.3996,5.9959,0.0606,0.001,2.0155,3.0702,3.8585,4.1216,2.1241,2.0321,2.051,1.4163,3.0935,5.0205,5.162,5.9279,2.775,2.0164,4.5208,0.8766,1.4748,3.1556,1.3586,1.2697,2.1968,7.1079,0.3504,2.6817,3.442,0.4085,5.1237,4.7772,4.6562,0.623,2.5115,5.0546,1.5226,1.8629,2.9955,2.1605,3.5853,0.001,0.0114,3.2639,5.504,5.7213,1.4892,5.0866,3.2083,3.1577,3.8282,0.9977,0.4528,0.0031,0.0924,1.4646,7.0074,0.441,1.3363,0.384,1.3492,0.0089,2.8272,2.6342,4.5416,3.5811,0.776,0.0041,0.0017,5.762,0.5302,1.1438,1.4499,1.1006,5.9125,1.8524,0.6688,1.1128,1.967,0.0017,1.7193,5.0226,0.0391,4.3061,1.1719,0.8998,3.6145,1.5724,2.28,0.6014,4.242,0.0582,0.0,0.0113,4.5753,1.6121,3.1534,1.433,2.8537,4.1377,2.9965,3.3465,4.7736,0.1672,0.9101,6.355,0.1409,0.0028,5.6287,1.7315,4.3286,0.0001,0.2014,0.7446,5.7934,1.3208,0.9405,4.199,1.0528,0.7369,4.6032,1.5608,3.2014,4.9466,0.752,0.5646,0.4517,5.9708,1.3688,3.1909,3.8566,2.1966,0.0069,0.4742,0.9053,1.6458,0.3668,4.1583,4.386,5.4036,3.6312,1.3333,0.0023,0.5001,1.5525,2.1474,0.0039,0.0024,1.6712,1.5926,2.2604,0.1102,2.607,0.0034,0.9931,5.0114,3.7781,4.81,2.1129,4.293,0.4305,0.0063,0.1449,0.6906,3.7649,3.8129,3.9865,0.153,3.6279,3.8043,2.5003]}

Lord Arryn is on the verge of losing his throne because of rebellion and assassination attempts from powerful families. After surviving the Black Death, he's now tasked by High Maester Pycelle with creating an elite squad of men to deal with the growing threat coming from the south - the Lannisters. For a soldier fighting in the war he leads, Jorah seems oddly detached. He hardly talks to his men, barely jokes with them. When they die, he doesn't cry, he just smiles. As for Daenerys, Tyrion would be thrilled to see what she's capable of. But unlike Daenerys she still prefers to rule while holding the dragon. And her love for Drogon is even more insistent that she remain dragonriding. Jorah's not surprised. It's never been in her nature.

If it actually were cheaper, it would have been better since we would be able to use it in more locations and the price could have been closer to that of an underwater habitat.\n\nInstead, this development is nothing more than a gimmick that costs more than the cost to build more habitat and filters out the same amount of carbon dioxide.\n\nFor an article on why it's really the opposite, check out the full article.","token_len":214,"entropy":[5.0839,8.3406,3.2953,4.4996,2.8296,2.1835,8.5899,1.2127,9.1491,1.6061,1.8218,6.259,3.627,1.8432,4.9081,0.0429,3.39,4.4579,0.3663,3.6365,1.0757,1.2141,0.467,6.1714,1.5237,3.6941,0.2735,6.0197,8.9327,5.0103,1.7882,7.769,0.2504,3.1003,2.0568,3.4556,2.4889,1.071,4.6487,2.1227,0.0048,0.1025,0.4328,3.2239,1.9899,0.7234,0.0478,1.125,2.0306,0.0025,5.6484,0.0679,4.4676,3.0095,0.0009,7.2346,6.4125,6.4077,2.995,1.0935,3.5343,2.835,3.3465,3.9589,4.4458,4.3784,4.2454,0.5985,0.1382,3.6879,0.521,0.3138,4.2613,2.3977,3.0554,2.0233,1.3291,3.9532,0.9098,3.7099,0.3556,1.6663,2.0683,0.908,0.6041,3.3491,0.3227,5.5701,0.128,2.4381,1.2464,0.3673,0.1946,0.9165,0.0002,4.895,2.2562,1.3334,1.2769,2.1732,4.8206,3.0245,0.4826,3.2128,3.4609,1.1517,1.0421,4.4399,0.135,1.8637,2.4581,4.3131,2.3898,2.8168,1.7332,2.5106,3.363,5.384,1.3629,6.0085,0.115,4.926,0.4961,0.1774,0.0446,0.1318,4.8552,2.8293,5.9621,4.1078,4.6794,0.8539,1.9126,0.5995,1.8119,0.3906,4.2779,3.6878,3.2642,1.7203,1.7771,0.1615,0.0053,2.7916,0.5338,2.0773,2.1973,2.7834,2.0047,4.6508,3.5835,2.8684,1.0045,0.3189,5.415,0.0064,1.9703,0.0409,1.7661,0.5136,0.1363,0.3142,0.2384,0.0002,5.3849,0.203,2.8772,5.9568,1.1896,4.379,0.4893,0.0237,0.4964,1.7495,1.4976,4.7278,1.7951,0.2374,0.9935,1.2647,1.9739,0.7339,6.1671,2.235,1.5133,1.4545,0.1531,3.8627,2.3325,0.5717,0.0214,0.4342,0.0529,0.4911,0.6501,0.0002,4.5126,4.3369,4.5097,1.2904,3.465,3.1307,0.9761,5.1266,5.0636,2.5233,0.8258,1.6719,0.1401,1.8097,4.2641,0.5182,2.2133]}

In the early years after the crucifixion, some people assumed that the demons had actually murdered Jesus. The evidence suggests, however, that it was he himself who appeared to these demoniacs and made them do his bidding. The myth of the battle has many variants, but most of them refer to a battle on a mountain where Jesus was defeated by a small army of demons.\n\nIn any case, it's interesting to note that the battle story can be found in multiple versions, in different cultures. The most popular account, which claims that Jesus actually died, is known as the Didache. As far as there is evidence however, the story is found in only one other manuscript of the Didache, a Syriac codex called The Gospel of Thomas. The Didache was first written around 120 CE.","token_len":215,"entropy":[7.4783,4.8512,8.3044,7.4681,0.4883,1.4299,0.0038,3.093,4.269,1.222,0.5155,2.9438,3.7022,3.1593,0.2211,2.3553,5.3079,4.1956,1.667,0.8923,3.9522,0.2827,3.4903,4.7367,1.2151,0.4692,3.4695,0.4644,1.5888,2.944,1.9262,5.2423,3.1771,0.0474,5.0086,1.3115,5.1298,0.413,1.1174,3.5683,3.0082,0.0273,0.0673,0.8535,2.7286,5.5369,3.0054,0.6662,1.9327,0.5233,1.802,1.0864,2.8235,4.0112,4.3166,0.3802,5.5413,0.0017,0.5056,3.7329,2.2787,5.346,0.1234,0.6567,3.8224,1.0474,3.5776,5.8995,0.1563,1.487,2.2058,5.5933,3.1054,2.653,0.2933,0.0031,0.0091,2.728,0.1332,6.1656,2.0792,0.1251,5.8896,0.4805,4.6312,4.6613,0.7059,0.0483,1.2721,4.4654,0.3998,4.596,1.381,0.174,0.2971,2.2835,4.6579,1.0403,0.1939,2.4718,4.2963,4.388,2.8643,0.7741,1.0359,3.3157,1.2485,0.2252,4.6547,0.0621,1.3627,1.5309,4.9684,1.3261,1.7109,2.5866,2.2451,1.7936,3.0313,0.5446,1.4445,4.8822,1.1487,0.1526,0.7149,0.5577,1.2018,0.0002,2.3723,5.0482,0.1855,0.0336,2.4012,2.686,3.1114,0.3749,0.4935,0.137,1.0285,3.1063,3.0563,4.8478,0.3747,0.4604,0.3663,4.4316,2.0499,1.7524,2.9678,1.5251,2.2261,1.0708,1.9051,2.7164,1.9858,4.6032,1.9635,2.1715,5.4556,0.741,1.6975,4.3822,1.8142,2.2786,1.0861,3.1546,0.0863,0.0875,5.7168,0.0668,1.3179,4.8347,3.3737,0.0863,5.729,0.5223,1.475,6.6952,0.0198,0.9056,2.5762,1.9021,4.3039,0.56,1.6461,0.4007,2.808,3.7803,3.3513,0.2599,0.8169,0.0037,0.6739,2.1946,2.5562,0.0003,5.3211,0.0023,3.7005,2.4199,2.7559,0.1652,1.1775,0.5909,1.8041,1.3889,0.0032,2.2211,3.3214,0.699,1.7529,3.8849,0.8727,1.9101]}

{"id":1826,"ended":true,"length":216,"gen_text":"The last conversation in Human history... is one that has been coming to an end for many, many millennia.\" (The quote comes from the opening lines of the novel \"The Long Earth, by Ursula LeGuin.) With the latest research on life on another planet, that future was once again being discussed. As scientists began exploring the planet, using the robotic Curiosity rover and others, they were finding evidence that the surface of Mars is habitable for life. The discovery has encouraged some to think that life might have begun on Earth. \"We have a planet on which intelligent life has probably begun... with or without human handiwork,\" said President Obama last year. As a scientist, I can sympathize with his optimism. There are some indications that life might be around other planets, and we could learn a lot about Mars from analyzing the chemical, geological and physical conditions. We also now know that Mars once had a liquid water ocean, so it wouldn't be too surprising if life evolved there also. We simply can't afford not to explore new worlds, not now and not ever.","token_len":219,"entropy":[5.3628,8.1365,4.1898,10.3219,7.1634,6.0529,2.71,4.2807,1.3469,2.8591,1.8508,5.4477,1.1864,0.8018,0.0338,0.4096,3.0161,1.501,0.014,3.0692,1.8152,4.0059,3.3414,6.2249,2.5269,0.0732,1.4774,3.4527,3.4499,0.1381,1.1496,3.5347,2.5519,1.024,4.6988,3.0438,4.427,1.026,3.642,0.0,1.5653,1.4536,0.0004,1.698,6.905,1.4924,5.5499,5.4026,2.3867,5.8404,0.7841,4.7433,0.1352,0.6692,3.9965,5.0124,5.7287,4.3155,0.1513,2.2456,1.4594,0.5185,4.3948,4.3939,2.4081,4.4615,0.7527,3.7624,0.8683,6.604,2.214,6.2701,3.7793,0.2172,2.711,4.94,0.2326,1.3214,2.0421,2.4498,1.8625,1.0175,1.3957,2.8695,0.5198,0.1648,2.3849,4.3235,2.8627,1.054,0.4317,2.4401,3.3505,3.333,5.8655,2.9586,0.946,2.8298,0.5376,1.9752,2.3431,1.0535,2.574,0.3525,1.6561,1.9228,3.4187,2.0748,1.9933,2.3018,3.5008,4.0761,1.0747,5.5711,0.0664,2.4632,4.1857,2.1677,4.2647,4.8706,4.1248,0.0122,4.3904,7.096,0.2049,0.0104,0.3243,1.1583,5.5664,0.3841,3.2995,0.7776,0.324,4.9386,2.8606,2.9407,0.4313,0.7213,3.055,4.829,0.0155,0.2775,2.4611,2.8316,0.4127,3.6454,1.179,3.2182,2.6957,0.1273,0.978,1.8002,2.0351,4.7358,2.2846,0.4081,1.3769,0.81,2.4188,3.3283,3.1655,1.3904,0.2702,0.9974,6.6978,1.4679,4.121,1.23,2.5623,4.9182,1.7808,0.6529,3.0457,2.3422,2.6827,3.2358,3.0834,4.9606,0.3952,0.2803,2.0183,1.9527,0.2735,1.126,2.7831,0.2801,0.3946,1.168,3.2429,1.5893,5.1456,0.0005,0.1102,2.103,1.0881,0.49,0.9584,2.5286,0.3413,5.5519,0.0713,3.3951,5.7213,3.248,0.0052,5.2528,2.2126,0.0057,0.9175,4.8991,0.7659,1.812,3.4511,2.5647,0.8909,0.0892,1.6852,0.1186]}

{"id":1959,"ended":false,"length":215,"gen_text":"God releases a sequel to the bible... God says that in the year 2012 he will judge the whole world by how good his people have been. He also makes the prophetess who has the ability to predict the future, his new bride. The Prophetess is named 'Yahweh' and she is pretty great. Her hair is light brown. She has an amazing figure and is very beautiful. She is told to give her virginity to the man she's dating that year. The wedding takes place in the year 2012. Everything that follows is described in the book of Numbers. There are some interesting plot points involved. A few things: 1. Yahweh says he's God. 2. Satan can't be trusted. 3.

If only all those people he brought over would stop begging to go home or to be let out of the basement. \"\n\nIt was in the year 2000 that the first pet owner suicide incident was recorded in Japan. In 2003, the Kanto police reported 15 cases of pet-crazed individuals, 12 of them children. In 2005, there was an additional three cases. Four years before this event, the Japan Federation for Animal Lovers, a local animal association, reported a case of dog and cat-eating.\n\nToday's pet deaths have changed dramatically. On the other hand, more than one-third of the suicides in Japan were for pets, and the most tragic cases involved dogs. In August 2016, for instance, a man reportedly took his pet dog to a bathtub in the middle of the night, tied him up, and drowned him. The next morning the owner, who later died, found the dog's petri dish filled with a mixture of the owner's blood and urine.","token_len":223,"entropy":[3.0403,2.7191,7.6364,2.7924,3.7354,6.5327,1.8698,2.7524,7.8302,5.1914,0.1051,2.2967,5.3506,1.8527,4.7777,0.6419,0.8953,4.4435,5.5288,4.1131,4.5998,2.525,5.7874,4.7263,4.866,3.6117,3.8713,8.2492,2.5209,3.2042,0.8182,5.5935,2.4941,1.9321,3.1758,0.552,0.7182,1.0311,5.2047,1.2745,4.428,1.6379,0.0178,4.8563,1.5953,4.9645,1.2681,5.2932,3.0462,0.4822,1.4726,2.3295,5.6057,4.2714,4.8805,6.0305,1.3591,2.2053,1.063,3.4886,0.2643,2.1245,4.659,0.3882,1.4482,5.9902,2.9063,5.186,2.9514,5.7585,1.0734,0.4462,0.9187,4.153,7.5139,1.2783,0.013,3.7233,2.5082,5.4182,0.191,1.1859,2.5324,0.5424,1.2712,2.0034,0.1125,2.5366,2.3579,2.4839,2.58,3.6915,0.7267,1.0493,5.7482,1.2124,5.7933,3.0193,6.313,0.1365,1.5509,3.9543,3.5623,1.464,1.4056,4.9099,0.0004,2.8824,1.5809,4.0096,1.1722,4.6967,0.2228,1.9904,2.1092,3.1625,0.5105,5.7665,3.9598,0.1497,2.7621,4.3493,1.2902,1.2553,0.0003,5.6506,3.6841,1.9705,5.0029,3.013,4.4745,3.5821,0.9591,5.4277,1.3837,2.7246,0.1129,0.0115,4.6696,2.6244,3.2244,1.104,0.2691,0.0369,0.9597,3.5396,1.7594,0.4744,3.0262,5.2877,2.1328,1.6218,1.7035,1.7654,3.793,6.1967,1.2771,2.0003,1.6992,0.9398,1.7906,5.4814,4.7799,0.0619,3.932,1.3662,0.0023,0.8322,2.5488,5.6501,3.0977,0.1083,2.043,1.1228,0.9295,1.3142,4.1955,0.8665,2.5772,1.7564,2.0312,0.0019,0.151,0.1482,1.1921,4.1064,2.9562,0.8741,0.7845,0.423,1.6601,0.2461,0.5617,2.0354,2.4869,1.0034,3.1434,2.7714,2.8532,1.4393,5.2224,2.5731,0.8001,2.4713,1.1578,0.9874,0.4146,6.8135,2.648,0.0447,3.3748,0.0096,3.8759,3.3039,0.0336,3.9622,2.5076,0.0086,0.3724,0.3895,2.165,0.2214]}

We must get on with doing the things that Jesus did to live a happy life.","token_len":226,"entropy":[5.7994,4.5642,3.6039,9.1054,0.477,3.1375,4.4955,0.8558,7.3827,1.3843,1.0995,3.2809,4.518,6.0658,1.269,4.7391,3.1081,3.3198,3.8417,0.1713,2.3543,4.9761,4.5238,1.2306,2.859,1.2042,2.6759,4.3258,4.5644,2.506,0.0867,0.1584,2.907,1.9387,1.2822,0.1582,4.7541,4.1881,1.8958,2.2609,5.2228,1.4376,1.0814,0.9587,0.1279,0.0291,0.007,0.0322,4.8677,2.9403,2.9704,0.5638,0.0079,0.1796,1.1303,5.0022,3.0063,3.6629,0.4214,0.0355,0.0089,0.0018,0.0196,1.5729,5.6292,1.6812,2.9761,2.6463,4.1778,3.158,3.6568,4.0017,2.3523,1.8814,0.5716,4.6991,1.5378,1.5374,3.1205,2.7372,4.6967,1.9255,0.5203,3.2709,6.7002,1.9744,0.0249,5.1648,2.3411,3.7425,2.1234,2.3916,2.5422,1.5478,2.286,1.5516,2.1805,0.7114,1.6828,4.6897,3.4112,2.0175,4.8105,5.8222,0.6086,2.5492,1.4015,1.1046,1.0308,4.9184,3.9443,3.3585,0.2988,0.2792,1.4852,3.5032,1.9159,3.149,0.9042,1.5369,0.314,0.5815,2.3595,2.0856,0.4954,0.0098,1.909,1.0182,0.6784,0.1706,4.9636,0.0007,4.6601,6.1183,4.4236,4.8061,0.1986,5.6484,0.4477,5.4068,0.2663,5.2467,5.4716,0.0275,0.3173,2.5801,3.4337,1.9001,0.3019,0.8737,3.1451,1.0351,5.1476,2.1997,0.2671,4.8782,4.3203,1.7626,3.0602,5.4769,1.2107,2.4956,0.0403,0.0202,0.3212,3.9267,1.3486,0.8291,3.8381,6.263,4.1183,0.2593,4.1718,4.3381,3.4058,1.4213,2.549,3.3984,1.5738,3.0052,1.8578,0.3637,2.5298,4.2294,2.2951,4.8551,0.3971,0.7781,1.5001,1.9684,1.4744,0.235,1.7941,3.0057,3.6282,7.5916,0.4237,3.104,0.1635,0.8363,1.9318,0.5675,2.0073,5.2929,0.3187,3.7078,5.0009,0.1512,2.7853,2.7186,5.5438,3.6074,1.2005,4.8568,1.198,1.2828,0.5128,2.9792,1.3171,3.6826,2.4914,0.8699,1.8182,0.3139,0.4989]}

I get so tired of seeing some of my own fellow Americans fall for it.","token_len":227,"entropy":[4.432,10.1721,0.4483,0.4311,5.2548,10.8266,2.0285,0.004,0.3681,2.7198,1.8572,2.9644,1.2129,4.2067,2.3878,5.69,0.2664,4.9918,0.4936,1.3836,6.5002,0.0904,0.1102,3.3791,0.011,0.0562,2.1728,3.8532,3.2819,5.1369,2.3822,0.0512,3.4326,4.2748,1.8152,1.9224,1.3392,5.4524,1.213,5.2107,0.4972,0.0014,1.8047,2.7542,2.9624,3.722,2.3019,0.6184,1.7221,4.1094,1.1207,5.6277,2.1186,3.0614,4.6234,2.383,2.8643,1.2295,1.1255,5.0788,4.7265,3.7204,0.5565,1.1629,4.0685,4.0526,1.3109,0.848,2.8692,3.1868,0.3936,3.6319,5.8662,2.8296,2.7479,0.2961,2.5377,4.7932,3.7874,2.2306,4.122,0.4579,2.8555,3.3426,2.9324,1.4538,1.7472,2.3249,3.795,0.0111,5.1238,5.1661,0.0002,1.6805,3.6159,0.5908,0.9947,0.0123,4.6819,3.6701,4.6591,0.3066,0.0523,3.6752,0.992,2.7135,0.037,4.4453,5.4922,4.1663,4.2603,0.1055,0.5677,1.9572,4.0888,2.9037,3.6999,5.1029,0.7049,0.0087,1.8047,3.0073,0.7073,1.7988,1.6676,6.0297,5.8657,3.1679,0.4252,1.9297,3.81,0.85,5.9769,0.8208,4.1146,4.2192,5.4293,3.1857,3.1485,2.042,5.6936,1.2969,5.5782,1.7807,0.918,0.2085,1.1402,0.1997,4.6037,0.0029,0.2962,1.0621,3.2798,0.0023,1.0419,3.1533,0.6572,5.5376,0.8556,1.9616,5.8099,0.7421,0.0118,5.2048,1.6652,3.3772,4.7731,0.3307,3.3408,3.6856,0.002,0.8877,3.1831,2.6391,2.0,2.971,3.3203,5.6049,4.979,2.6823,0.0023,3.3263,0.0479,0.429,2.9895,0.8942,3.3878,1.723,1.3135,2.6515,1.5477,3.1112,0.7808,0.0023,3.5215,4.1761,4.1491,0.3954,4.3034,4.3459,2.0065,0.3567,3.2629,3.3046,1.9153,0.0506,1.9671,0.0004,2.6821,1.0905,4.4475,5.2159,3.8079,0.6833,0.0276,2.9303,5.6634,0.7352,1.1026,3.7097,2.8482,1.0658,4.2689,0.6569,2.6207,0.2311]}

{"id":2660,"ended":true,"length":200,"gen_text":"An alternate universe where Homo sapiens were not the only species of the Homo genus to survive to current time, nor were they the only species capable of using fire, and the other species, like Neanderthals and Homo erectus did also survive until approximately 20,000-10,000 BP.\n\nThis could also explain why there were two main species of Homo during this time period: Homo erectus and Homo sapiens. The Homo erectus lineage continued existing during this timeframe. However, it is interesting to ponder the fact that Homo erectus evolved in Africa with the use of fire, but Homo sapiens evolved exclusively in Eurasia. Some anthropologists speculate that the human species did not evolve in Africa: it may have originated elsewhere.\n\nThis alternate timeline could also explain the existence of Homo ergaster living in the Arabian Peninsula during the same time period as Homo erectus. Also, the existence of what we call Neanderthals there could also be explained as the result of a second Homo species surviving during the second period of humankind's evolution. Neanderthals in this timeline may be the descendants of Homo erectus.","token_len":228,"entropy":[6.9299,4.4681,2.1416,11.1664,0.4554,0.02,3.3475,2.3709,1.6003,2.9774,1.7982,2.6141,2.8339,4.7823,0.6458,4.025,2.3571,3.4197,6.8213,2.5441,1.7472,5.7607,1.1168,0.8935,0.2757,0.4977,1.0699,3.9245,0.0053,4.1005,2.0312,1.7733,1.9059,2.0389,3.629,1.2031,3.6716,3.3373,2.7698,0.0351,0.0002,1.4716,1.9716,0.7441,0.0,4.2827,5.6472,1.5726,3.9394,5.0627,3.3178,0.1181,0.0143,5.2766,2.5567,0.0067,0.0249,3.0264,0.6321,1.4679,0.0104,3.5471,5.3451,2.3224,1.4603,0.8551,2.5522,1.8937,4.1578,4.7903,2.9549,0.2227,0.6408,5.3597,1.4334,0.5704,0.9673,1.6552,0.7807,0.589,0.0003,0.4049,0.1099,0.4372,0.0009,0.2905,2.5092,2.3333,0.0758,0.0016,3.9169,4.0531,6.3404,4.5755,1.0314,4.6606,2.3937,2.9701,0.1048,2.4993,1.278,5.619,0.2009,7.1963,1.9233,2.5245,0.0301,1.611,0.3476,0.0003,4.4364,2.4395,0.6493,5.0178,1.528,4.0137,0.0054,0.2449,0.8646,2.1521,2.5997,0.0831,0.0016,1.5787,6.1647,0.1055,1.6961,0.0035,1.5057,5.721,3.3478,0.0292,2.7775,0.0884,1.4018,5.267,2.1685,3.2742,0.2601,1.3067,0.5631,0.3102,7.0228,2.1975,2.2358,0.1937,3.2727,2.5455,1.3068,0.7103,0.0002,3.0355,2.7907,0.8081,1.7686,0.6181,0.266,1.1271,2.6601,0.0106,2.2122,5.1987,0.0008,7.4843,0.4949,1.691,4.6463,0.2755,1.4984,0.6891,2.3709,0.4817,0.1997,0.8404,0.4629,0.4169,0.0004,0.5326,5.116,0.233,1.6437,1.4191,0.0124,6.6103,2.9323,1.7062,1.3305,0.0804,0.0003,6.6351,1.2871,1.1331,0.4593,0.2874,2.4909,2.182,0.8572,0.0038,1.744,4.5641,3.1124,1.5807,3.6502,3.3223,1.4478,5.026,2.8638,0.6069,5.9754,0.6329,2.7988,0.3631,4.6805,0.0838,0.0005,4.294,1.7016,1.2372,2.3897,2.5833,1.5844,1.732,0.0159,0.6182,0.2578,0.0001,0.9525]}

Grim Rapper allows you to play Death Knight, Rogue or Warlock minions while Grim Reaper is in play. Grim Rapper has two uses.\n\n1.) In the early game and lategame. Grim Rapper is a very good card for killing minions you really need to destroy. The Grim Reaper can deal with some weak minions so it will always be a good target for Grim Rapper. The card also gives you a good amount of cards to discard, with Grim Reaper the amount of cards you need to discard are much less.\n\n2.) In Control Warrior you will often have a lot of cards in your hand and Grim Reaper can give you a good deal of cards and some tempo by killing some very low cost minions that normally would not die to Grim Patroller. Sometimes it can be very good to kill a 2 mana minion, or even a 0 \/ 2 and give you another Grim Rapper on board.","token_len":230,"entropy":[1.9996,6.1241,4.4385,7.2919,0.0865,4.2514,0.0022,4.8995,1.9522,3.9649,1.825,3.2818,8.559,7.969,6.1093,4.9653,3.0388,1.7732,0.2692,0.66,1.6309,0.0031,3.4179,0.1543,0.5114,0.0213,1.1564,0.7009,3.6465,4.5717,2.9533,1.0788,1.9952,2.072,0.0404,0.3471,3.3833,2.6263,0.5717,0.1599,0.8845,0.7248,0.1898,2.4138,0.0179,0.0015,2.3811,0.4781,0.0259,2.2331,6.2733,4.7183,2.2471,3.7218,1.1935,1.7043,3.4521,4.5691,0.4222,0.0062,0.1027,0.232,0.0186,0.4382,2.6012,0.042,0.0026,3.0723,2.1041,3.0292,0.9672,1.9909,0.0001,3.0785,3.6263,5.2419,1.1147,1.555,0.1864,6.0174,4.7636,0.0299,0.0,4.6665,1.7491,0.1082,0.0028,1.8109,0.8986,2.5801,2.1739,1.6483,1.9927,4.2992,1.8518,4.6324,4.7873,1.3385,0.1105,4.1103,0.8091,3.1241,2.6662,1.3505,2.0804,4.6999,0.4944,3.7292,4.7614,0.5503,4.9387,2.7062,3.3941,3.6858,0.7957,1.5949,0.7199,4.3347,1.2935,0.5547,0.0342,0.0071,0.1398,2.9098,3.2533,2.0183,2.9083,0.5659,1.0161,2.1227,3.6117,0.004,3.4981,1.539,3.0712,2.9344,5.032,1.4307,1.6383,4.3876,3.6071,0.1004,0.3564,0.412,4.6421,0.0963,0.1274,3.1041,2.9252,1.9778,0.6456,0.5664,0.0001,0.0687,0.0092,1.5242,5.3754,2.4206,3.4158,2.8682,1.1853,1.8551,1.5858,0.569,0.016,1.8096,0.509,0.4398,0.2553,1.333,1.5203,1.818,1.5908,2.5994,0.0398,1.0696,1.9585,3.8155,0.0965,0.5191,4.5899,4.1061,2.3165,3.5978,2.2215,2.2995,5.2228,2.5275,0.618,0.2563,3.3837,4.7613,1.4196,2.4766,0.9696,1.5597,1.7729,3.6065,1.1098,0.2172,6.1111,2.1859,1.3586,1.0997,3.1349,1.7345,0.1506,2.7719,0.7846,2.9916,1.8253,1.0222,2.7821,3.0911,1.2523,0.3245,2.8672,6.7517,1.3501,3.8141,3.8812,0.8071,3.0884,1.6734,1.9363,0.0096,4.7556,2.7414,0.404]}

Our brains have been designed to handle a very limited amount of processing power. So when the processing load starts to get too heavy, our minds will fall back on more intuitive and automatic processes, such as primal reactions.\n\nThat's why most people with panic attacks tend to avoid certain situations for weeks or even months. We try to ease our distress with medication, drugs, and other therapies, but this only deepens our suffering. And that's the opposite of what the Dalai Lama's advice recommends. It's never easier to solve your stress by giving up responsibility and letting things happen on their own terms.\n\nIt may sound counterintuitive, but being able to simply get on with your life in a way that's comfortable and healthy can be just as effective as having an intervention.","token_len":231,"entropy":[9.6106,2.1421,9.3189,0.7232,1.0242,1.9288,1.3247,0.005,3.0302,4.735,6.3243,2.9057,1.8945,5.7676,1.9873,6.6323,2.8551,5.9588,3.147,2.4732,4.4546,0.0017,2.1382,1.1775,0.9962,3.0323,3.4686,1.1216,1.3141,5.5701,0.82,1.5656,1.1958,3.1426,1.0062,5.1537,4.3178,0.7905,0.7658,0.0002,3.8425,5.7253,3.6843,4.0142,0.2203,1.4771,5.2869,0.249,1.4086,2.6787,0.0177,5.0682,1.8637,3.7283,0.8124,0.3408,0.4378,2.035,0.0002,3.7684,0.4096,4.76,1.014,0.648,1.1189,4.2575,3.9523,2.3648,3.6235,0.2436,0.0121,0.3942,3.0388,2.4448,1.614,1.8106,1.7376,0.2693,1.2875,1.6773,3.4915,1.4339,1.1382,0.0681,4.3428,0.4414,0.7292,3.2714,1.0926,3.5076,2.2471,1.4556,4.339,0.3243,1.2743,0.5307,1.7864,0.1882,1.0986,2.8457,3.9597,4.4287,0.724,0.1542,3.9606,4.7821,2.1011,1.9481,2.7812,1.6714,2.0012,0.0025,5.4718,3.0674,1.7588,0.5506,0.0002,3.1585,0.4416,1.4702,4.4958,1.3729,5.1083,4.0727,0.1766,3.4793,0.0081,4.4352,4.1084,0.3439,4.7908,3.6403,0.654,0.8391,0.033,0.843,3.4769,3.5056,0.1457,5.7394,0.9835,4.4901,2.5381,3.4295,0.783,4.716,0.3786,1.5193,1.6372,3.7184,1.2325,0.215,4.6659,1.1573,5.3307,0.0003,0.807,1.2456,0.3018,3.7573,3.1032,0.4654,2.6141,5.2761,0.0431,0.2894,0.9759,0.2735,0.0007,3.0581,1.2656,3.347,0.5239,4.1911,0.6374,5.0824,5.5301,0.0471,5.2973,1.5313,4.6487,2.4498,4.142,0.7078,6.5727,1.5332,2.1082,3.6671,1.4523,2.4431,0.0039,0.0023,4.1833,0.0907,0.1955,0.0002,3.6176,3.4244,2.0889,1.2511,0.0581,0.325,0.0322,4.306,3.2043,0.0023,4.9424,4.3455,2.2873,0.0148,0.8466,0.2195,3.5783,0.9904,1.302,0.0438,1.6048,2.9125,0.8686,5.3552,2.1302,1.4691,2.6622,0.0943,2.0023,0.544,4.5,3.0623,2.9546,0.7993]}

And I really hope that, one day, someone can figure out how to communicate to our players using something as simple as a single tweet, so some of the other theories can go away.\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":231,"entropy":[3.4679,8.1924,2.612,10.7301,3.7418,0.9958,2.2747,5.8482,0.5886,6.9584,0.4934,8.933,2.757,4.9384,3.0998,0.3037,10.4004,4.9152,1.6409,1.7953,7.6441,1.3794,6.385,4.1257,0.4389,1.7198,6.3663,5.6506,3.7972,0.725,5.0184,1.4909,3.0591,4.1336,0.5369,1.5597,0.206,5.0489,3.9483,0.6575,1.4343,4.6951,2.7445,0.5514,5.9172,1.2006,3.0318,3.4033,1.9399,2.9889,1.269,3.1452,1.7329,1.1998,0.5534,3.6247,0.6249,4.4032,3.9299,2.256,2.2992,2.941,1.4839,1.701,0.86,1.4841,6.411,0.2645,0.9921,0.044,5.59,0.5142,5.1346,2.3191,1.9525,1.805,6.615,0.28,0.9984,0.6528,0.0001,3.354,0.4697,1.2428,2.8957,0.0725,2.2194,1.4704,1.0381,2.7476,5.3329,0.1586,1.3892,0.0279,1.2313,4.3123,0.7991,3.5149,2.7019,1.5943,2.6586,5.0538,0.5619,3.0439,2.429,1.02,5.2061,1.2814,4.2194,5.6677,2.1866,0.9263,0.2912,3.6241,0.7078,0.9131,0.4494,1.7478,5.565,5.0687,2.2877,1.5763,0.063,1.7021,1.2908,6.339,1.3389,0.7886,0.0496,4.7234,3.7139,4.8103,1.1241,4.3937,0.856,0.3671,0.7639,0.7007,3.4974,1.6708,4.0749,2.6626,0.7066,2.5343,4.0447,2.881,2.4574,0.0655,3.6011,4.5087,1.7403,3.7151,5.7567,0.5268,4.4535,0.6253,0.0002,0.4702,1.8443,2.1508,4.1393,1.3137,3.1092,0.1978,0.9543,1.7715,3.2676,4.6445,2.3312,4.8975,0.5697,0.4408,2.857,1.053,4.7914,1.6075,0.0553,0.2216,0.3808,4.7558,5.4088,0.029,1.965,1.8556,0.7934,2.1236,1.1528,0.7207,1.1776,3.5359,2.0185,4.2132,2.0202,0.757,3.9643,2.0335,0.0046,0.0715,3.1155,2.9802,2.1866,0.1524,1.1059,0.4163,4.4736,3.1137,4.1941,3.6492,6.8335,4.2438,1.8531,1.0297,0.1248,0.9669,4.7859,4.2687,2.8965,3.0613,8.3118,0.7202,1.3812,4.8235,3.2821,0.9849,3.9758,0.2518,0.586,0.567,0.0002,6.6081]}

Again, it could just be gibberish.\n\nIt definitely sounds like the first part of the famous phrase ''I am Jack Torrance'' or ''I killed Richard Alpert''\n\nThe phrase seems to appear in pretty much every incarnation of the screenplay.\n\nThe first part can be a reference to the fact that Jack killed Mr. Lander in the original draft but in the revised draft it got changed to 'Jack kills Richard Alpert'.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Richard Alpert has been listed as dead.\n\nMaybe it was meant to be a joke on how Mr. Alpert's name is already taken, like the surname of the main protagonist from the book.","token_len":234,"entropy":[8.0587,3.4092,7.0975,6.0793,1.1799,2.7177,1.1718,0.5723,0.1314,0.0084,0.9439,6.4943,1.676,0.0167,1.5788,3.4162,3.1974,0.0002,4.406,1.4744,5.4136,3.6509,6.9683,0.0015,0.0016,1.2048,2.3654,3.3272,0.6985,2.1985,6.0433,5.6549,3.813,0.0466,5.6453,3.4957,0.8566,0.3181,3.588,0.6433,5.4002,2.3211,4.0359,1.3511,4.6528,1.8495,2.4455,4.3349,6.713,4.3965,0.3123,1.9153,0.0001,4.5727,4.4091,2.8461,0.3029,2.6639,3.2309,5.5337,0.0317,0.8091,4.4459,5.8389,2.1479,1.0182,2.7506,1.2513,1.6993,0.0001,1.8249,4.6801,3.7834,2.99,2.4701,5.3319,3.8968,1.4364,0.0001,1.5758,3.498,1.9273,1.0337,5.9285,3.6612,4.1941,1.8227,1.3807,2.6242,7.6178,0.592,1.9344,0.6106,2.0071,0.0911,0.2225,0.0001,0.0003,0.4574,0.3808,0.0001,2.9776,6.7224,1.4687,0.1726,1.734,3.3327,2.8459,0.1182,0.4084,5.8917,3.7798,2.5416,2.5899,2.7976,5.3994,3.961,0.0343,1.4054,3.936,1.3339,0.9531,5.2565,6.4424,0.9614,0.0026,1.1093,2.0943,0.0002,1.9942,2.4236,3.8134,0.0827,4.9738,0.9919,6.9337,0.172,0.2543,5.8585,0.0911,0.2473,4.7585,0.6362,0.5915,0.0002,1.886,2.5464,1.5929,4.8257,0.3648,3.924,1.5487,0.0246,0.7963,3.859,0.0946,0.9082,4.2745,5.353,0.099,4.4543,3.7086,1.765,0.5631,1.6645,3.0683,3.682,3.0958,0.2229,3.1616,0.8861,2.5094,6.9697,0.7876,0.3336,3.534,2.8133,2.7128,1.1358,0.63,0.0021,1.0629,0.4983,0.0002,2.9847,4.5402,0.0006,1.1245,0.6568,0.1483,1.5303,5.2867,0.1915,0.0002,0.79,0.2679,6.9141,0.4016,2.381,0.7022,1.878,0.0002,5.4278,1.625,1.8795,3.6032,0.1512,0.3098,1.3614,3.3529,2.9117,2.5724,4.0058,0.0487,0.9892,0.0007,2.2424,1.7139,1.448,5.0567,1.2719,2.6955,3.3252,1.9155,5.9784,0.8903,1.6079,3.1798,4.1021,2.9659,0.7482,3.0175,1.295]}

Millions of years later, a crew of European explorers land on the shore of the New World...and are attacked by sabercats. The survivors are forced to build a fortress to defend themselves...but with all the survivors scattered throughout the continent, it's up to the humans to reestablish proper civilization. The humans establish an outpost that is quickly overrun and captured by the sabercats. As the sabercats take up residence, they set about eradicating the European survivors. However, it is only a matter of time before the sabertooths begin preying on the people who survived the sabercat assault. The story ends here? That's a movie, with a movie ending. Is that an ending that your audience will accept? As a movie, I can't say the same.

She also shares her thoughts on politics, and explains why some people who oppose Trump are hypocrites.","token_len":237,"entropy":[5.5903,0.1456,0.0686,0.0494,12.4931,4.5407,2.0206,11.5136,3.0879,7.3778,0.3289,2.0558,9.9413,3.1609,0.9197,3.9379,2.4222,3.6328,0.7845,1.594,1.0255,0.0011,3.5244,1.3584,4.3431,0.393,2.5075,1.6976,0.5105,5.3859,0.9808,4.7099,0.1085,1.263,0.0027,0.7767,0.8629,5.3693,4.1999,2.7252,5.1275,3.1455,4.931,2.3941,3.5641,4.0878,0.4438,0.0578,1.8207,0.4228,2.7056,0.0002,3.5369,3.6005,5.3596,3.6465,1.6396,2.8432,4.0687,5.5047,0.332,1.1828,0.2622,1.7194,5.0941,0.4177,3.8282,2.8941,3.6214,0.2231,4.7809,0.1184,3.1654,0.6363,0.6292,0.0002,2.4403,2.515,0.0556,5.1263,5.3884,5.0894,0.0149,3.8255,4.3581,0.0986,5.4323,0.2772,2.5965,3.1646,5.2635,0.4045,1.9726,1.3848,0.0019,0.4892,4.2711,0.844,0.0104,3.4757,3.7267,0.554,0.2362,0.0002,3.9219,5.7753,1.876,0.2604,2.4882,3.1934,0.5067,6.1684,0.1442,0.0001,3.7653,0.2466,0.2076,3.0823,0.1307,4.5452,1.1048,1.1047,4.9432,0.5556,6.5622,3.9258,5.2525,3.1237,0.6063,1.1941,0.0112,4.1227,0.8789,0.0085,0.2985,0.6572,1.5818,2.7109,2.2207,0.1141,4.4617,5.3725,2.3738,1.9149,2.1405,1.9074,4.067,2.979,0.0474,1.1538,0.0002,4.3251,0.1613,3.969,1.3556,1.8918,1.6684,5.1036,1.1359,3.5188,1.6473,0.0826,0.0008,0.003,0.0,0.4394,5.665,3.3443,2.8032,5.2277,2.3898,0.9975,1.8021,2.2832,2.3839,0.3649,3.0308,6.0193,4.3389,4.7404,2.1932,5.0369,0.4915,3.8528,5.4138,0.4458,4.8074,0.5678,1.821,2.6752,4.4597,5.282,5.4555,0.0311,2.0064,4.666,0.9946,1.4438,0.1576,0.0035,1.4443,0.7736,0.0916,3.6529,0.2606,2.1934,2.3891,0.6237,2.443,2.4809,1.1472,0.9445,5.6374,0.8736,0.0082,0.0974,2.2986,1.8514,1.8336,1.1678,1.7286,0.2532,4.6738,0.4756,2.5709,4.2875,0.6387,4.8947,0.9522,5.3008,3.3836,2.3152,1.127,4.4822,0.0038,0.141]}

Inside are three matches that are lit by the embers of a fire that has been burning for years. In this case, the match set was accidentally left in a car that was abandoned at the side of the road. The match ends up in the hands of four soldiers of the Allied Army and they decide to light a fire using the three matches that had been handed to them. Unfortunately, the matches start to emit the smoke of the fire that has been burning for years so the four men who were supposed to be using the match never knew they had it in their hands. In a last ditch attempt, they break into a house and are able to use the match to light the fire while they try to stay alive. One of the men dies saving them but the other three make it out alive and the match ends up being used to light the house again. The next morning the five men who have been living in that house are found. They have all found each other through a series of coincidences.

{"id":2802,"ended":false,"length":235,"gen_text":"The knight goes to rescue the princess in the tower - but when he arrives, he finds that she is already dead, and her husband has stolen her body to live in eternal pleasure. The prince, who was in love with the princess, is also turned evil and has murdered his king to become the next ruler of the kingdom. As the king's loyal knights try to rescue him, they are all killed and their bodies turn to stone. The only person who can fight back and save them is the knight's cousin named Prince Edward, who was actually the prince all along. Edward becomes the guardian of the castle and of the king's soul, and he has a terrible secret to keep - about his father, the evil Count Roger, who is really a member of the knight's order. One day while they are away in the forest trying to find the princess, they discover a giant, skeleton-like monster who turns out to be the knight's father, and that's when it's revealed to be a man called Count Roger of the Black Death. Now Edward has to decide whether to help the knights or to slay the monster.

I dont have the information to decide on this so I'm afraid I won't know until I get to the hardware.It would be really good to receive some information about some real vehicles, like the light bulbs type, or what shape traffic lights are made of.Thanks","token_len":240,"entropy":[3.5634,3.0965,9.1986,1.7221,5.5435,1.1774,6.7198,0.4692,4.0291,1.9063,2.327,3.8921,1.4834,0.6279,1.4935,0.0028,5.2465,0.9521,4.9243,3.2345,1.2578,0.6944,3.9038,1.985,1.035,3.2377,0.5984,0.572,0.0002,2.7383,2.3632,0.8764,2.899,5.2016,0.1927,2.0583,1.3088,4.0252,0.6021,0.7225,0.2693,0.0918,1.7915,2.4434,1.1761,4.1347,6.281,4.9764,2.268,1.6417,0.6345,0.2085,0.0002,3.6607,0.6969,0.4209,3.3927,3.4068,1.5564,1.3932,3.6429,0.419,0.0002,1.7491,4.7047,1.6983,0.6107,1.0249,3.8368,1.8757,6.1828,5.584,2.6106,2.8211,2.8663,0.3578,1.2882,0.0002,3.2467,2.6479,4.5318,0.6879,1.6105,10.3075,1.2609,0.0002,4.2358,5.4267,0.2395,0.1421,0.1202,0.1204,0.0763,0.9881,3.8265,0.0003,2.6077,2.7243,0.8667,1.338,2.4501,0.368,0.0002,5.8208,0.0103,3.4566,1.2303,0.0003,5.6308,0.0864,1.8835,0.9832,0.0002,4.6659,5.2093,5.2496,2.1692,3.941,1.3382,4.9893,4.0491,4.1848,0.3502,0.7225,1.4509,1.4284,2.081,1.8536,2.5065,0.314,0.1518,1.1426,4.1722,4.0505,3.3489,1.1781,1.339,0.6466,2.2068,1.9241,3.4918,5.8264,3.0612,0.1412,3.0783,2.092,0.2088,0.0466,1.9023,3.1682,0.3328,0.6822,1.9589,3.6401,0.5364,1.2309,1.7606,1.9834,2.9917,5.6585,0.9582,1.6935,0.6106,5.8925,2.0633,6.5123,2.2269,3.3234,4.103,2.2154,1.8747,4.1828,4.5001,3.4129,3.3694,1.6548,2.0902,0.1919,2.8216,5.5957,3.7835,0.3522,6.0741,1.751,1.6423,2.2398,4.7689,3.1894,1.8431,4.5053,1.0748,4.3233,2.8758,0.7712,4.5406,0.5748,4.2723,4.4888,0.73,4.3805,0.0052,0.986,1.8616,0.2953,1.6258,2.9651,1.064,4.9967,1.1964,5.7653,2.8415,0.5661,3.9126,3.6844,0.961,7.3413,1.5095,1.7724,1.6335,5.8498,4.3113,7.3107,2.1195,2.6108,2.2819,3.6406,3.0847,7.8056,0.6254,3.0637,2.9131,5.9193,5.7684,0.2531,0.3284,0.4895,0.4268,0.6596,3.0777]}

As we go through the tunnels, we will discover what makes this place so special for North Korean's and how they live there.\n\nThe photos from North Korea:\n\nWe will also post some of the most amazing things that can be done in North Korea, such as hiking with the animals and even go fishing :).\n\nWe want to show the world what we found on the North side of the Korean border and the incredible world that lies below.","token_len":240,"entropy":[7.2343,2.6826,7.8983,1.1261,8.1013,1.3136,3.319,5.2211,0.1107,4.6431,0.6278,1.0909,7.6886,6.1938,1.9639,10.2633,2.7583,0.8505,5.4829,1.1955,7.0309,0.929,5.2678,4.1223,4.4917,3.5981,1.0184,5.0526,3.9916,1.4179,1.0316,3.7405,5.6091,3.0687,4.7801,0.1063,1.1859,9.3114,1.0671,2.2723,3.726,4.5581,4.4001,1.9885,3.8086,0.455,4.2952,1.135,9.3362,0.0086,0.4066,7.3848,3.0028,2.6043,7.9454,6.1863,0.4409,1.7274,0.0206,5.0815,0.2057,4.8831,5.8365,1.1542,5.5895,7.441,2.7501,2.1113,0.0001,5.1678,5.3363,1.9932,4.5084,0.9946,4.2543,0.8448,0.0001,2.476,3.1428,1.1727,2.0299,7.6048,4.6249,2.3274,4.9347,3.6307,4.624,2.0396,5.5007,1.582,0.8054,0.0351,1.4864,0.8642,2.1256,1.994,2.1984,5.2236,3.9597,4.6544,6.3589,6.6498,5.0145,4.8466,4.9585,1.1176,1.7681,0.0002,2.4953,0.5376,1.3398,0.9217,1.8695,1.2119,0.0291,1.5333,3.517,1.8943,2.756,4.6256,0.544,0.876,0.172,2.215,1.1176,3.2185,0.8775,1.7482,2.9067,2.4472,4.8957,0.6466,2.4678,4.3038,3.0063,0.9818,4.2935,3.5028,0.0139,0.4239,0.4909,1.1037,3.6083,2.4617,4.2059,0.1862,6.1972,2.1324,2.3632,2.3097,0.7852,2.6025,0.7334,0.1954,0.1692,3.6874,2.3689,2.8842,3.3066,0.9176,0.6804,0.5139,3.557,1.2732,2.6534,3.54,2.0821,1.7357,0.8142,1.386,1.5343,0.2752,0.3451,0.0002,2.1743,5.1058,2.5673,3.3461,0.1379,5.46,0.8632,0.0002,2.4168,0.9819,1.9547,6.1447,1.7329,1.5473,0.5011,2.84,1.7885,3.3728,1.7287,4.3605,0.301,3.526,0.8144,0.7158,0.016,1.8409,2.0933,0.0142,5.0437,3.817,1.9338,4.4644,1.9782,3.8928,4.3408,3.4502,5.8179,0.9469,0.3546,0.0002,2.2691,2.8102,0.1741,2.259,1.3292,0.4855,1.5225,3.8741,3.2085,3.3233,0.8789,1.3205,4.4134,0.4854,0.0639,3.5988,1.6812,1.8401,3.1185,3.1323,3.8334,1.4575,2.1792,2.0472,0.791]}

They landed about the same time that Richard Feynman said the word ``I`` in a lecture, the Martian word he used for ``I`` was ``oedodictic`` not ``oidic``.","token_len":244,"entropy":[9.0428,8.2735,3.1918,6.4098,9.1625,4.6088,1.097,6.5063,6.8972,0.25,1.0531,1.5454,3.019,6.1759,8.304,0.335,8.8571,3.4858,1.452,2.3057,5.7021,10.8662,12.6634,2.9247,4.1425,1.2995,3.2256,4.7349,2.0679,0.0856,4.6749,2.0706,3.9568,1.6278,3.1798,4.9902,2.6026,1.0982,1.0135,1.3848,3.1647,4.2701,1.5785,0.7539,0.2682,1.7167,1.0836,2.0301,0.0002,2.461,2.81,3.0681,2.9165,2.9122,0.0469,2.0482,2.8533,1.2608,4.5449,0.0306,0.2238,1.7361,2.2933,2.2614,3.0633,3.525,1.1316,0.8954,0.4293,1.4059,1.4993,0.0857,0.44,0.9271,0.0002,1.6023,5.5007,0.81,1.2346,0.7313,6.675,1.7853,1.9537,2.0595,2.677,1.6721,4.4642,7.0886,0.0702,0.3882,4.4068,1.3142,0.7657,0.6368,1.3916,0.0298,0.4193,0.4549,0.0002,4.232,4.1803,0.2724,1.3759,5.7739,4.8159,0.0527,0.8822,1.7378,1.3023,0.6222,3.369,2.3806,3.9741,1.0289,3.6378,1.3319,5.49,5.0548,4.8695,1.6027,6.7828,3.0341,3.1063,0.5527,1.6812,4.2748,5.6266,2.761,0.2372,0.0683,0.8688,5.9164,4.5957,7.0643,0.0679,2.471,0.1669,0.0045,0.3528,2.4051,0.3325,5.8682,7.1974,1.8353,0.1387,0.4159,0.2874,0.5239,0.0002,3.9779,2.3044,4.8526,6.088,2.4432,3.5396,3.512,0.8401,4.3832,1.6461,4.234,4.744,2.6186,3.4038,5.2126,2.2625,2.3116,0.6194,1.6174,2.479,0.679,4.742,0.1449,0.0015,4.7633,1.1769,3.6843,1.1978,3.1694,0.299,1.2648,0.0415,0.0619,4.212,1.789,2.0832,0.016,2.4007,2.0743,0.4363,3.7644,5.4555,6.2439,0.4665,4.7665,0.0788,5.5772,2.4366,1.387,0.4495,3.4667,3.1521,4.5158,4.6143,0.496,0.266,1.5369,6.168,1.851,0.0005,0.0341,4.8904,2.6656,2.7113,0.4843,2.8556,2.4375,1.3394,2.7333,0.9548,3.0293,3.5692,4.3948,1.175,4.47,0.7506,2.1772,0.5819,0.4312,0.3424,1.3271,1.162,5.1357,6.5608,4.8917,4.7817,1.6677,0.449,5.5894,0.1581,5.3141,1.5312,0.1523,1.6538]}

On the moon, people who survived Earth attacks are transported to Mars, on Earth and then on Mars to find a solution to this conflict.\n\nIn 2041, a new space program is found, and a battle ensues between the people and the aliens, with the Moon colony taking its side and the Earth population fighting for survival and new homes.\n\nIn 2044, an asteroid named Chelyabinsk destroys a massive chunk of Mars during the asteroid belt. Since there is no Earth based system in any position in space, the humans lose hope for some time.","token_len":244,"entropy":[9.5184,6.6092,4.6138,2.689,0.8151,6.1273,7.3371,4.8601,14.7276,3.8322,1.4891,1.3767,2.3766,1.1868,1.4077,0.955,3.12,1.8108,6.4093,13.7844,1.8069,1.7718,2.9992,5.0989,0.4659,1.5477,7.1416,1.5312,8.582,2.0486,0.5468,0.565,1.3028,1.508,2.4822,0.0067,5.2412,0.1757,3.1737,2.9317,3.353,0.7133,6.1154,5.4764,0.0529,1.6371,2.1151,1.6595,4.6396,3.5367,3.3017,0.3008,0.9217,0.4262,0.625,4.052,1.4538,3.9136,0.3366,1.7524,2.6611,0.0787,5.7312,4.9145,4.2865,0.4624,3.5218,3.1914,3.968,3.7093,4.9078,0.0732,1.9143,4.8008,2.7523,1.8858,1.5792,2.2471,3.8352,4.2099,2.6507,2.2521,2.9469,5.6055,0.2912,2.8557,0.6637,4.5437,5.258,0.5201,1.343,7.6169,2.1233,3.7241,1.5053,3.2124,1.6916,1.411,2.8506,1.4104,3.5472,5.9559,1.8575,1.6697,2.8473,2.0765,0.332,0.5188,0.0002,1.8681,4.9608,0.3527,1.5768,4.3824,5.1771,1.1315,1.3025,0.8028,2.7602,4.0812,0.9518,2.9756,3.1047,2.264,2.5108,5.382,1.1757,5.5228,1.8158,3.1559,0.4407,3.3538,4.9026,2.932,4.0411,5.4007,2.5223,4.5805,0.3164,1.5933,1.9539,5.5486,1.3785,3.2558,4.1317,1.4022,0.9145,3.191,2.8766,1.6426,3.2216,1.1099,3.4847,3.6771,0.1299,0.6667,0.0002,1.8064,0.6024,2.8562,0.154,2.0905,1.9394,2.5446,1.086,1.154,5.2841,2.0351,2.0345,2.3971,6.0112,3.7173,0.0004,0.815,0.8558,3.2945,1.2027,0.3932,0.7834,2.3042,2.5108,0.8693,4.7053,2.253,4.6983,6.5456,0.8475,2.3232,1.1763,1.6295,5.7583,2.561,1.3041,1.7188,3.8197,4.7026,3.2391,0.5497,0.4393,0.0002,1.4605,0.5762,3.6086,0.11,3.8442,3.3887,5.0238,4.52,0.7398,0.0135,0.0004,3.4793,2.1199,5.1004,1.4124,0.0109,3.3159,7.4478,1.6947,4.3121,1.2026,1.6262,4.8153,2.5315,1.3023,0.2618,2.724,5.7875,4.6428,3.5499,6.2173,3.3358,2.7686,1.2759,0.4798,1.2004,3.9664,5.2799,3.9773,2.1296,6.2577,0.6494,0.5981]}

Her entire personality is just a bit more abrasive and more like she's living her life rather than just surviving it.\n\nAlfred eventually returns to helping Batman with his crime-fighting but he doesn't seem to have a better handle on how to handle her as well, with him being the more serious mentor and she going more off the cuff. As a result, the two end up getting away with a lot more than they would have without Batman around.\n\nThis goes some way towards explaining the differences between the comics and the Dark Knight Returns prequel film, with Batman's actions making Harley so much more important than he ever intended. This may be the difference in how the film and the comics feel about her as a character.","token_len":249,"entropy":[10.4506,2.303,2.9943,10.2066,5.9661,1.8528,8.8269,1.8974,7.2655,1.0134,2.0904,1.2505,0.0251,0.3263,1.9281,0.0362,0.9347,6.4808,3.4099,6.8606,1.736,4.2193,7.0958,0.7372,8.6943,3.3163,0.6369,1.9499,5.1981,8.4896,5.203,1.65,1.0406,1.4506,1.6009,5.9108,4.2954,0.6376,0.3698,1.179,0.001,4.9692,0.2594,2.2485,1.8952,4.3472,3.8397,0.9835,0.7555,1.605,1.5969,3.8579,0.0201,0.4685,0.655,1.3337,4.3928,0.1843,0.5549,5.4612,1.6634,5.5555,0.1533,0.6745,6.5484,0.2101,0.2508,2.5376,0.0716,3.6868,0.0213,5.3598,6.5242,3.2428,0.3573,2.8811,0.6454,0.7464,3.151,3.9985,0.158,5.6117,1.0799,4.3318,0.0854,1.055,1.6813,2.3614,3.1365,0.3633,4.1768,6.1621,1.7847,4.1988,4.3667,4.2995,2.1843,0.5187,3.5517,5.8202,1.8057,1.7028,4.3974,1.7085,1.6496,0.6342,4.5026,0.0023,1.0199,3.3402,4.6063,2.9443,0.9125,4.1267,2.0105,1.3209,3.8155,0.0184,2.6403,3.3627,0.4593,0.251,0.8361,0.0002,4.4491,0.9377,0.0006,5.5923,3.1758,0.5107,4.7892,1.3021,3.1656,0.7364,2.8138,0.4927,0.0193,3.4666,2.6844,3.4455,0.0004,1.9038,0.4974,1.9182,2.4185,4.6268,2.8508,0.0191,2.2745,0.201,1.55,1.4195,2.5956,3.0447,2.4616,3.9955,3.1855,3.0678,3.7866,2.1534,3.3342,3.1187,2.0862,1.9514,5.5063,3.2325,2.1678,0.6966,2.5401,1.1573,4.1973,1.0262,0.063,0.2477,2.3933,0.7868,3.1033,0.0058,3.2193,6.453,2.1608,1.3879,0.3328,1.0025,0.5354,0.3546,1.5965,0.5976,3.6284,1.2533,2.9345,0.4935,0.5083,0.0002,3.5832,5.567,4.695,0.1086,1.5675,0.1403,2.5179,4.1476,0.5795,1.0377,4.8517,0.2069,0.524,6.8433,0.0615,0.6208,3.2025,0.4206,2.1002,1.2508,2.5629,1.7273,2.9302,4.7283,4.7019,1.6822,5.1757,1.0379,0.2294,5.5806,1.6968,1.557,1.5261,3.904,0.4542,3.7092,4.3715,1.7495,2.0295,4.8007,2.7424,1.3895,1.7617,2.5896,1.903,0.5891,0.6557,4.0302,0.6862,3.0207,3.15,0.4923,0.2471,0.6584]}

The problem is you will leave Heaven 2.0 and the Earth 3.0 because you were sent to it by accident. If you were sent by accident what happened to you is your choice. You know what to do and your family and friends will do it for you too. If Heaven 2.0 can provide it's own answer or you can help them build it then they won't send you back. They will send your parents. Your friends. This is heaven. You won't leave Heaven because you couldn't make a decision for yourself and when you left you didn't ask for it nor was it asked of you. You were sent to Heaven by accident.","token_len":250,"entropy":[7.3889,5.2781,8.7537,11.0669,0.043,0.2019,0.1465,3.4156,5.7238,9.2696,0.9279,0.0195,0.9364,2.4792,0.9141,4.6167,3.101,3.2393,1.1196,2.4762,6.0026,0.6752,5.0293,6.8569,1.3241,1.3082,5.2069,4.1764,1.0583,1.826,4.8152,0.1281,6.4434,1.1651,5.2173,0.6635,2.5838,2.3281,3.5405,1.0276,4.991,4.9293,0.6722,2.4433,0.6873,3.9932,0.311,1.3153,1.7884,1.7013,0.9961,1.0023,1.0655,2.986,3.9977,0.7794,1.2153,0.1131,1.0124,0.6242,0.7922,3.1955,0.1634,0.6366,0.2118,4.2406,5.1118,1.9311,0.2789,2.7826,1.8122,0.7687,2.422,4.7374,0.0055,1.7237,1.3662,0.9001,4.2628,0.6683,5.0166,1.5176,0.0049,0.0042,3.113,1.6146,1.9145,3.285,1.2334,1.2686,2.6598,3.307,5.9014,0.7831,0.1727,0.0731,2.7686,1.2462,4.7432,0.5016,1.0469,1.8149,3.2569,5.3791,4.0953,0.7958,6.183,0.9104,3.7407,1.5539,3.3176,4.5738,1.6489,1.6231,2.0725,3.3228,3.9346,0.2582,2.4589,4.3692,5.9585,1.7214,0.4692,0.0031,0.0013,1.4798,3.1777,4.7512,2.5041,0.0378,0.026,3.9384,0.7712,3.2802,1.5863,0.8258,1.3147,1.7219,0.2175,0.4764,3.4462,0.2719,2.049,0.7981,1.263,0.9087,5.1018,3.2659,0.6113,2.2403,2.2276,3.7957,3.5905,0.4247,1.1401,4.4637,1.66,2.7574,0.0924,1.3267,4.578,0.6568,0.3559,0.0246,2.6282,2.9791,1.1106,1.0061,0.0071,5.1007,0.163,2.5889,4.4668,0.2002,0.0048,0.0013,4.5492,5.499,3.4584,1.1405,2.1609,5.9635,4.3355,2.6849,1.8266,4.4953,2.262,4.7317,0.9315,1.9262,2.5484,3.648,0.0009,2.2979,0.0605,1.1165,0.8952,2.3959,0.9411,1.4323,4.5011,6.3128,4.2352,2.0955,1.7498,0.4221,5.1551,0.338,4.789,1.6341,2.1361,4.6775,0.0022,3.0182,2.8523,3.336,0.5637,5.9652,0.0005,3.9315,2.2148,1.2138,2.2664,0.1051,2.3621,4.8284,0.3136,3.0003,1.6507,2.5136,0.0004,1.4185,0.4613,0.4478,6.0969,2.5773,0.3105,3.3021,1.1889,0.0125,0.2256,1.1509,1.7597,0.8361,0.9071,0.7055,0.912,0.1669,0.6342]}

Is he dead for good or are his abilities eternal?\n\nOr...\n\nIs the hero in fact living, breathing proof that all is indeed not lost? He really is invincible! The hero is the only thing standing between everyone and their doom. The problem is, he's also really weak. But his friends are all powerful, and he doesn't have a clue how powerful he really is. This comic is for anyone who just wants to know what happens next in this seemingly hopeless situation.","token_len":253,"entropy":[9.3494,4.0373,10.2552,2.6458,2.737,4.1375,6.1877,5.5106,0.0028,0.0412,4.9189,0.7514,4.1022,1.0296,11.9949,2.0685,7.4261,1.5807,5.4148,0.0077,0.0053,5.4083,1.2971,0.4059,0.6401,2.4225,2.1724,0.9289,4.7291,1.3575,0.8943,1.1225,0.0141,6.9717,3.0511,0.5207,0.106,5.1083,5.6738,5.1919,0.7278,1.7727,3.3158,0.6175,0.4244,0.0073,1.1386,1.7073,1.7469,1.6061,0.2293,4.2187,0.2025,4.1122,4.1578,3.5513,0.4157,1.4722,2.2324,0.3943,3.4989,0.0001,0.9773,0.6958,0.4625,0.9051,5.7942,0.048,3.7988,1.6026,2.5731,0.0017,0.8011,1.0868,0.8292,6.3393,2.5246,5.415,0.736,2.4891,2.609,5.685,5.0567,0.3358,0.7031,0.4311,1.7484,0.2903,5.7045,0.8977,6.6358,0.6704,2.0778,3.395,2.8039,0.4819,0.7364,3.9695,2.0647,0.1703,1.5662,2.0823,0.8008,2.0203,6.3911,3.8864,4.3831,3.2722,2.2291,1.5274,0.0225,0.2271,0.2259,0.0001,7.2154,5.613,0.8515,0.0153,0.0045,0.0049,0.0011,0.0067,5.4364,1.1562,5.8757,0.1113,1.1191,0.4792,3.7245,0.3087,2.5747,5.8197,3.1126,6.7495,2.5246,0.7126,0.0076,1.475,4.7506,0.3795,3.0296,0.1678,1.3618,1.6102,2.3515,4.2658,4.4882,3.863,1.8624,0.0011,4.0886,0.4523,6.2621,1.6349,1.72,5.2045,0.1034,1.8238,4.0707,1.3663,4.2853,4.7437,0.2011,1.0849,0.0001,4.5171,4.4185,0.42,0.0001,6.6251,0.892,0.3927,3.6954,2.5095,5.4938,2.0223,5.7269,3.4562,0.3073,3.8133,2.0291,3.7156,1.3642,0.7154,0.4626,3.4783,6.5771,0.788,3.1366,1.6355,2.8629,2.3097,1.2938,1.8581,1.9492,2.4232,0.8349,0.3851,6.0764,0.6411,3.6501,1.1494,0.8693,2.5494,5.4868,0.1471,0.9511,1.0753,1.0883,2.2802,4.8804,3.3344,0.5784,4.0327,4.1497,2.6273,1.6152,2.9743,5.0399,1.4086,1.3373,2.2282,3.0906,0.0007,0.8432,1.7702,2.9516,0.6341,4.5866,2.152,0.547,0.0068,0.2708,4.8948,6.2085,1.1901,3.2051,3.7331,0.1675,4.6641,1.0805,0.159,2.4827,1.8444,1.2391,1.9276,2.0962,1.8031,5.6596,1.2134,0.2399,0.2475]}

But there's no question in my mind that this is what she really hears and sees when she looks at you.","token_len":255,"entropy":[3.305,7.5208,7.7908,0.1574,1.5651,3.6233,11.2531,1.861,2.6336,6.2169,1.0419,2.4671,3.424,5.1757,2.6375,7.0068,0.4411,15.9441,8.5572,7.0862,3.4661,0.0139,2.4221,5.9239,1.6162,10.518,0.3462,5.5155,9.2593,1.5471,1.7403,1.8781,3.1692,6.4214,0.7062,3.3853,0.8914,2.1564,4.388,2.5136,1.4045,1.633,5.2403,1.3216,0.3217,2.8818,0.0301,2.7812,5.6366,2.3626,2.6289,3.8828,4.6948,2.6505,1.9141,1.1193,2.0456,0.82,0.4458,0.2547,0.897,0.796,2.584,1.7938,2.9245,3.3948,0.9756,1.7252,0.0084,0.6702,3.213,3.3962,1.7088,0.2886,1.7005,5.4627,2.2422,1.711,2.1006,1.042,5.0435,3.4653,0.8063,0.9191,2.9266,0.0485,1.6948,0.0002,2.6204,5.7526,1.1273,4.6923,6.0422,5.5923,0.3149,4.0045,3.3943,1.7713,0.5849,3.564,1.2971,2.6014,3.7647,1.6086,0.6376,2.0951,3.0264,2.0664,2.8325,1.0178,2.5184,0.0162,3.3399,0.3314,0.0544,2.1399,0.5129,1.071,3.1292,2.8503,3.0155,0.3823,1.5573,0.0025,4.625,0.9798,2.4397,0.1214,2.1473,1.6183,1.946,2.2189,1.5289,0.9965,0.7483,0.2074,1.6609,3.3599,3.0673,1.918,4.161,1.2906,0.1489,1.3365,1.4304,0.7418,0.0002,2.7724,4.5657,1.1427,0.2884,2.7882,1.8155,0.1297,0.0044,0.2718,0.7861,3.6657,2.6449,1.5527,4.4872,4.3765,1.9145,6.0928,3.1635,0.0018,1.1674,1.072,2.7935,3.2546,1.4698,0.4644,0.0675,3.5802,0.2354,0.0574,3.5106,3.9367,1.1947,5.2101,3.7995,0.0364,1.6764,0.6607,2.0517,0.9669,5.8947,4.7828,0.0185,1.9541,2.7773,4.6797,1.5212,4.8335,0.4102,0.8161,0.0002,3.0589,3.5378,0.9407,3.3342,1.6499,1.8399,0.5319,0.7693,0.1089,0.7806,5.3576,1.9753,0.6987,0.4007,2.5317,0.6555,1.4151,4.02,2.3713,2.9608,0.002,2.7794,0.3568,3.1298,1.2607,3.2233,6.9997,0.6316,1.5953,2.39,2.129,2.8722,0.0005,4.3161,1.3869,3.7653,1.635,1.0065,3.5474,1.6946,0.2461,0.004,0.2769,3.0254,0.6882,2.1788,1.5529,4.1068,4.6896,3.3663,1.3672,2.7736,0.9211,0.892,0.7268,0.0759,0.4447]}

As we said earlier, death row is not the place to look for hope; it never was. Death row has become a place to see hopelessness. Death row is an institution where hope has become a commodity, a price that is asked of you just to stay alive. One person tells us her own hope, but she tells us hope from a book and never from what she knows. It's never from someone she knows and loves.\n\nPeople have made some of the most serious mistakes in our history. I imagine there is a lot of hope on death row.

The body appears to have been mutilated in a fashion similar to that of a human serial killer. Footprints and evidence found at the scene suggest this act of violence was committed by a 2nd Sasquatch. Other clues strongly point to this being true since the body has many human characteristics suggesting it had human parts. In short, it seems like there was a 2nd Sasquatch in our time line. If you think humans are an entirely different humanoid species then this is a wake up call for sure and is the strongest example of yet another species on the planet. If this were to be proven then it would change everything in the world regarding our origins. The discovery of the first body is believed to be evidence that humans and other beings from space were here at one point as well. These creatures could also be what we consider our ancestors or our direct ancestors. As a scientist, I can't say the discovery is a definite clue or proof but it is certainly compelling enough to warrant serious investigation. I hope and pray that what we find out is as dramatic as this video and we continue to learn about humanity and its relationship with the other world.\nPosted by Mark Gaffney at 8:00 AM","token_len":258,"entropy":[12.957,0.4171,0.0083,7.0761,3.003,0.2187,0.4917,6.7396,0.1865,0.4405,0.0044,0.574,7.1127,1.0178,1.9323,2.3811,6.1257,0.0439,1.0836,0.2815,6.0768,0.0014,3.1397,1.2955,4.0176,1.4727,0.0045,1.3234,0.1737,0.9724,2.5949,6.3326,0.0362,0.5285,7.7559,4.2161,2.2569,4.2249,3.7314,1.373,0.0471,0.7375,2.0076,3.0238,8.3597,0.9384,0.9264,0.9206,1.7261,0.596,0.5503,8.3538,3.9972,4.5431,0.0026,0.0008,0.6632,6.8084,2.7966,5.9599,2.2649,0.1986,1.2246,0.2227,6.4099,6.5552,0.9833,1.9037,2.0436,4.2698,3.4489,1.2139,6.8664,1.3927,3.5482,3.2688,5.8398,1.0696,4.557,4.9054,0.3833,2.418,2.8165,2.3871,2.8118,2.431,0.4706,2.8317,0.0031,0.2284,0.001,0.0006,1.7854,2.9955,4.9237,4.0376,0.6684,3.962,1.4829,2.7241,5.6974,0.8844,5.2386,6.1078,1.4302,7.4087,0.6854,2.08,1.5135,1.4833,1.6444,4.6847,0.3887,0.0031,1.4687,8.7754,4.3281,3.783,2.6382,4.8084,5.8911,0.9197,6.2169,1.6083,2.2186,3.3454,1.3095,0.321,0.9543,3.3477,2.5099,2.8031,1.6306,0.5711,1.4914,2.7347,1.4367,0.3793,3.5267,1.2067,3.4392,0.947,1.6982,4.6991,1.6468,3.8094,1.0925,2.6921,4.5698,0.3388,1.5327,3.7877,2.2115,1.7153,5.2013,0.025,0.6076,4.5527,1.365,1.8344,2.2661,1.5814,4.3725,2.2723,4.6258,3.3796,1.7357,2.6308,0.6724,0.6546,4.6611,0.4993,0.2375,4.8581,2.3435,2.4282,3.5778,0.5393,5.0902,1.9084,3.8078,3.8761,1.01,3.0512,2.6101,4.2039,0.2343,0.6278,4.711,2.8943,4.0071,1.6711,0.5429,2.6745,1.7044,2.4807,4.3749,2.4665,1.5978,2.6861,4.0866,6.0835,3.5136,1.1308,1.9666,0.6882,1.0616,1.8111,3.8698,2.0929,0.2902,1.5463,4.1126,1.1707,0.3032,2.7794,2.9179,5.6531,0.171,0.6849,5.1979,1.6269,1.2633,2.7373,1.1675,2.5522,5.6796,0.4675,1.6162,5.1164,2.7547,3.9722,4.5616,0.1683,1.8163,2.0465,4.8357,1.2337,2.5693,3.8085,0.7876,1.3637,2.1332,3.7364,0.6383,1.4966,4.4996,0.0058,5.349,4.5949,3.4465,0.2594,0.0817,2.2393,0.0373,2.977,0.2646]}

The acronym \"W3c\" stands for the group of companies which makes the Internet.\n\nSecond, Wikipedia claims that during the creation of the World WideWeb, the idea for creating wikis came to a group of researchers at the University of California-Berkeley.

But when they started pulling up one of the bones, it revealed the head of a female, the man said.\n\nAP \/ NBC News","token_len":261,"entropy":[3.0393,4.6239,6.8316,9.1537,4.8419,0.4678,0.1749,1.3766,2.6822,1.4714,4.1972,0.0007,3.2906,0.3487,1.3621,3.1458,3.8963,5.4156,0.9392,5.0266,2.2748,1.2257,0.4094,1.3088,4.0908,5.1314,2.78,0.6287,2.118,4.3166,2.2958,1.7768,5.5051,2.4813,4.5035,4.7277,1.6724,2.4589,4.6886,1.2535,5.3698,2.7206,0.0445,4.3927,2.1252,3.6825,0.5661,0.2079,4.6748,1.7329,5.2514,0.2598,1.4366,0.4249,1.4543,2.206,5.1688,0.0718,4.13,2.8299,0.1906,2.2181,0.2967,1.8358,6.7501,6.1406,2.9002,1.0898,3.9057,3.5787,0.5177,1.4045,0.4655,2.8773,3.0551,1.6296,5.9056,0.0005,2.2814,5.0587,1.4416,2.7471,0.0091,1.5596,1.6054,1.5031,2.8136,0.0003,1.739,1.0434,0.2931,0.1992,2.2503,0.1564,0.2482,0.5568,0.3767,0.0839,0.0495,0.5736,5.9693,5.4233,0.0336,2.2845,0.6063,4.4587,0.3798,2.2341,1.8438,0.9922,2.9719,3.9408,2.9686,1.5771,3.3988,0.9928,3.2278,1.3765,4.2022,4.6759,5.1735,0.4158,3.7618,6.0982,3.2145,0.1236,1.996,4.6812,5.4994,0.9642,5.3054,3.0258,4.2161,0.321,4.2141,1.1032,4.3504,2.9925,4.3134,1.7014,2.4093,4.2727,0.0139,3.9045,0.0975,1.5805,0.9719,1.0181,0.4568,4.6193,2.7336,0.8083,3.7324,0.3694,2.0611,4.5385,2.0727,4.7595,4.3016,5.8058,0.0835,2.0327,1.3675,1.7831,2.5308,4.0941,1.6442,2.0645,4.6134,1.6101,2.2873,2.0134,1.4313,4.3547,5.7132,0.0013,2.2509,4.5457,0.7088,1.7289,4.8928,2.3814,0.8136,4.4912,0.1608,1.97,3.2005,2.2508,1.7463,3.298,4.9583,0.7816,5.0212,5.3292,0.0008,0.0912,1.1115,2.7594,5.7116,1.9683,2.2326,3.725,0.0285,4.1629,0.0127,2.8981,1.0022,3.1351,0.1807,0.0033,0.522,3.0142,0.7173,5.3599,0.299,0.0046,0.9691,0.2181,5.89,3.7727,3.5222,0.0058,0.6903,2.5265,1.7688,2.1254,0.0913,2.3744,2.1636,2.5939,0.4603,1.8212,2.7297,0.6507,2.9053,5.1214,0.5716,4.7149,0.7822,0.1663,5.65,0.2704,1.7746,4.6335,1.7826,3.31,0.2598,0.2507,3.9389,2.3075,3.3456,2.8447,1.8419,0.0798,3.1433,0.0188,5.4922,4.3019,5.1383,0.3435]}

This will give some of the other girls who are in the same boat the strength to know they are not alone in their pain.\n\nGood luck, and I hope today you find yourself a wonderful girlfriend.","token_len":264,"entropy":[4.4718,2.2405,1.2191,9.4902,1.5967,0.5991,4.3383,1.8761,7.2923,4.5241,2.1562,0.1003,0.3125,1.963,1.0088,3.4287,3.0564,2.5579,1.3517,0.4196,0.5626,0.307,0.7164,5.6715,0.7037,0.9481,5.9073,1.8356,0.8111,1.2305,8.0676,1.3825,3.5799,0.7726,2.3035,5.7197,0.9502,11.9211,9.0586,1.7754,0.3951,3.2027,1.6408,3.7697,2.8762,5.0699,3.7463,2.6183,1.5056,5.1014,2.2762,1.9178,2.324,6.3476,0.9575,1.1173,2.8149,3.2841,0.5006,0.5502,4.0635,3.1767,1.7173,1.9595,1.0453,4.0651,0.7925,2.0686,0.7891,3.2089,0.348,1.737,0.9576,4.0885,6.8209,2.2101,3.7481,0.0451,0.7312,3.4549,0.7312,2.4042,5.2465,2.6418,1.8884,0.7429,5.0461,0.1237,3.511,3.1012,1.5127,0.4103,6.8895,3.0059,2.437,5.8644,2.0609,1.0716,3.0893,0.4003,1.8576,4.2973,0.0418,1.7252,1.5633,4.1845,2.0076,0.0112,3.8985,0.9408,2.9023,4.268,4.0411,4.0529,0.5682,0.7132,2.1566,2.2143,1.1919,3.3938,4.1305,1.8004,2.7896,1.0678,0.0547,5.0853,4.7053,1.5867,2.4166,0.5302,0.353,1.6045,1.0439,3.3036,1.5221,3.6388,1.1122,1.7372,1.2582,1.6976,1.0071,0.1756,4.164,0.5813,2.805,1.1091,1.1015,4.6511,1.3848,3.7385,3.5583,1.5451,0.6455,4.3221,0.3125,3.0023,1.2541,1.9928,1.4077,1.6287,3.2578,3.696,5.1796,0.0603,2.5176,1.1812,3.1929,1.1539,5.5488,1.2442,2.7645,2.7478,2.1336,1.4933,2.0806,2.604,3.134,4.5457,0.6184,6.2822,2.2915,2.425,4.7049,3.7123,3.8754,0.9649,2.7635,0.0234,3.8083,0.3764,0.6522,1.7848,0.665,0.6678,0.0001,3.0604,1.8914,4.4647,2.9149,6.0221,0.5257,3.5759,0.2695,1.6634,0.0336,3.6164,3.1685,3.7557,0.3766,1.6877,0.4876,5.6107,0.9464,1.0416,1.4585,0.4538,0.1844,0.5398,0.1975,0.1011,0.2997,3.3844,2.3714,3.0478,7.3876,2.3605,2.4576,3.4906,2.2752,2.6495,1.4721,2.8422,1.217,0.7982,1.9075,2.3443,2.8204,0.2326,4.9448,1.7075,0.693,0.3588,0.1055,2.1688,0.8632,2.3141,0.2589,1.2431,0.0002,5.1849,0.5133,1.1945,0.8085,1.7678,0.9467,5.2508,2.3346,1.4288,4.032,1.7169,3.7306,2.9621,0.4991]}

If you drop anything the witch will come and find it and you will have to try to catch it before it disappears.\n\nNo one is trying to kill anyone, it is just a game but when your time is up and you run down the hallway it is just there waiting to be found and killed.\n\nThe witch gets some of the pieces from the floors and makes them disappear and places them elsewhere, you have to get them back.\n\nGood luck and let me know if you have any problems when you download this program.","token_len":267,"entropy":[9.3896,3.5942,2.177,0.0712,2.5354,5.6542,2.6828,1.6719,5.4812,0.7297,3.3265,2.9944,0.8689,2.7083,7.3073,0.0927,5.4049,2.2491,7.4402,0.9731,4.5575,0.0028,4.4991,7.5481,2.1285,0.5436,1.7089,2.0476,1.1172,9.1182,13.2237,4.6724,0.3402,2.3039,0.6477,2.0982,7.681,5.3446,0.0814,0.2244,5.8758,1.3922,1.6023,2.1211,4.2495,0.3748,3.4354,0.9668,5.1114,3.1555,3.4442,4.7872,2.1425,5.2495,0.7718,2.1722,2.1935,2.3203,0.7585,3.2264,1.3487,5.1194,1.7558,0.8373,4.1307,1.2558,4.1216,0.135,0.0476,3.2301,3.9711,3.2788,0.8742,4.2074,0.0826,1.9138,1.1249,2.1264,0.0329,4.2672,4.8007,0.6147,1.2247,0.91,2.571,0.6934,0.7028,2.9123,2.5856,4.6286,0.3769,5.2224,0.6498,0.5389,0.4287,0.9597,3.9019,0.9728,2.4129,5.4842,2.6794,2.4303,4.5503,0.5676,2.3067,1.0955,2.0151,0.0001,4.4922,0.9663,1.7671,4.8155,3.1849,1.0074,1.6827,5.4605,0.3566,0.1098,2.5491,3.055,1.5103,3.6473,0.8529,1.4858,4.0439,0.0567,0.5407,3.1517,3.2827,0.4253,2.0055,1.9017,0.6229,3.4011,1.1992,3.9304,3.6494,0.6233,0.3286,2.0721,4.6444,1.0192,3.6349,1.2254,2.6922,0.3127,4.2054,2.036,4.7139,2.5639,0.915,1.7893,3.1601,1.9619,3.0272,0.2303,1.9104,1.3707,0.1491,4.0633,1.6062,3.2632,0.5654,0.7553,2.9674,1.1794,4.1474,0.379,0.6984,1.9676,0.7035,0.9582,0.1371,3.3851,1.1934,2.6093,0.094,1.7963,1.2475,1.316,0.3006,0.8471,0.0002,5.9369,1.2669,2.181,4.8285,0.0089,0.4311,5.308,1.5901,2.8281,0.3861,0.5643,0.618,0.2634,4.1291,4.3274,4.6741,0.8189,0.5648,0.0328,3.0265,0.5148,4.9517,4.0091,0.2209,1.4074,4.1662,0.9768,3.8992,5.5192,0.9098,1.9277,1.5609,2.0101,2.8004,3.809,0.207,0.8213,0.0002,2.2742,3.3467,5.9094,5.4684,1.9383,0.7093,4.5529,3.3426,0.8256,5.0974,0.6097,4.0717,1.9994,1.9085,1.4099,3.9921,0.3537,5.7446,2.7484,2.4628,1.3872,0.1663,3.5508,0.6566,0.4505,0.8582,0.9119,0.0002,5.7209,0.4903,1.454,3.3944,0.1898,0.0125,1.5192,0.2397,0.7873,0.0654,2.1021,7.1982,0.568,5.8813,1.5316,4.4297,0.3249]}

On this voyage he encounters a sentient robot in a time machine named HAL7IV. The robot reminds him of his son who was taken from him before his first trip through the ocean.\n\nHe sets out on what he believes to be his first journey and discovers he has actually been to another planet, the year is 3227 and the moon is called LONE STAR. After some trouble with the space traffic control system, HAL5IV, with a simple command, takes over his ship and sets off on his journey through a strange and alien world. Although the moon is called \"the lonely star\" it is actually a natural phenomenon that happens when some object near the moon falls into the orbit.

This is also the year when the baby boys body was first tattooed by a tattooer called Mike. In 2004, he introduced himself to tattoo history when he produced his first and thus far only child artist'The World'.\n\nWhen this article was first written, it had been a rumor for years that The World had stopped tattooing new clients; however, this was true. After The World had moved on to a new body art area. In 2008, this rumor proved to be true when one of his last clients asked him to tattoo him a baby's face, however in the eyes of some this was considered an act of disrespect and disrespect to the parents, who were never asked what they wanted. It was never an act of disrespect and disrespect to The World, however he has said that it was his decision and he doesn't allow other artists any say in this. In 2015, this rumor was proven to be true when one of The World's customers showed up to get tattooed a baby's face.

{"id":1238,"ended":true,"length":261,"gen_text":"The city gets new street lamps, but these lamps are `` smart ''. If a crime ( like a robbery ) or car crash happens under, or in the vicinity of one, the light will turn red as an indicator to the police. One night, every street lamp in the city turns red.\n\nHowever, in this case, since the vehicle crash ( the one incident ) had happened in broad daylight, the traffic did not stop and the traffic cops didn't have the time to react. So the police officers on the scene, did not make the right decision of proceeding with the prosecution and thus the case ended up in a plea bargain.\n\nWhen this occurs, the traffic officers will probably charge you with the traffic offenses or the traffic violations. This will probably leave you with more than one violation, and the cost would probably be a ticket for each type. If charged with 4 traffic offenses or traffic violations, your cost may be nearly $ 500 a month.\n\nA good option is to keep your car out of the garage and simply drive it occasionally. There is some traffic violations and some traffic ticket which will not be issued to an owner using a car everyday.\n\nIf you keep some of the key elements of owning a good car, you are in control of your car and can protect your vehicle and your insurance.","token_len":269,"entropy":[6.2951,7.9963,6.3731,5.2406,4.6673,1.4247,2.8984,5.5518,4.7608,0.9769,13.3332,14.5767,7.8969,4.6543,4.8876,1.9683,6.0025,6.5154,5.5408,0.9774,2.9758,0.841,4.7427,5.0376,1.8198,1.9289,6.1709,5.8183,2.898,2.2965,1.6718,1.0243,0.069,3.7718,2.4683,0.5653,3.1172,1.4713,2.0713,1.8707,5.1379,3.0514,3.0354,1.8093,1.3035,1.8774,0.8956,5.8975,4.7808,0.7389,7.9527,2.0472,0.341,1.32,0.7492,0.2056,2.8929,0.3607,0.9263,2.8925,0.3252,5.3929,0.0866,3.1589,2.6297,1.9408,0.4218,5.7588,0.7263,6.4859,6.135,4.2818,3.1094,3.4851,5.7482,1.6038,3.4457,1.4481,1.4597,4.8679,0.0171,0.4211,0.8149,4.446,6.6985,0.0441,1.7279,1.8757,0.9717,3.2889,4.1779,4.2558,0.0401,3.0186,2.2087,0.8753,0.1293,3.7029,0.638,2.5208,1.5993,2.2399,3.1305,3.5961,0.5497,0.62,3.0402,3.4284,0.2243,4.5733,1.6913,1.9035,0.8154,4.2694,4.9555,0.495,0.6282,3.5199,2.4557,4.841,1.4727,1.6477,3.062,1.2089,0.8167,1.1984,2.5669,0.2615,0.6135,0.6083,0.0001,4.8789,3.5104,5.7393,0.3739,0.896,3.9012,3.9922,2.7846,4.8373,5.9257,1.7984,0.4992,2.8258,2.7291,4.3207,4.6657,2.6413,2.1676,1.4591,1.3963,3.0306,1.8382,3.7118,5.4949,0.2331,0.922,4.8582,1.4714,1.9947,3.1657,2.2154,1.8368,2.5852,3.6069,4.9218,3.0132,0.5099,2.9238,5.3386,2.1905,1.5303,7.2348,2.8821,3.376,6.3997,0.3205,6.1308,1.8776,1.38,2.5844,2.2804,0.12,0.2362,2.7825,3.4181,3.4459,0.6841,5.2548,0.482,7.7308,5.3603,1.3395,0.8432,0.7663,0.0002,3.9774,2.8993,3.5533,0.9019,0.0973,5.001,1.2524,0.9359,3.9006,0.0486,0.4526,5.2262,1.3342,4.4936,1.6286,1.057,5.9247,1.0101,4.5935,1.1463,5.1978,5.5489,3.0681,3.1289,3.6204,1.2144,4.1118,5.2262,2.4171,1.2623,1.2015,2.1889,2.076,4.8257,1.7079,7.1849,1.3936,1.2225,6.5411,0.3155,1.1968,0.0002,2.4233,0.3746,3.7374,7.3447,2.4374,1.6392,6.1694,2.9608,0.462,4.5267,0.2373,7.0288,0.4605,1.4255,1.0222,3.2281,2.958,4.1609,0.2218,0.761,1.6888,1.3318,1.7427,4.6327,1.7539,2.5043,1.912,1.5472,3.6441,1.6658]}

A mistake that will eventually cost us.","token_len":270,"entropy":[10.7845,5.7832,3.5917,5.7974,2.9219,5.1056,4.7057,1.8838,1.2217,1.2081,2.2051,0.9872,2.813,1.4576,0.5099,11.9473,2.3133,3.6481,0.7313,0.7927,3.8579,2.8157,1.9544,5.5054,2.5889,1.3679,2.8281,0.1844,0.98,4.6522,2.9353,11.8404,0.089,0.0078,4.8528,0.4214,3.0041,15.0007,10.6861,1.7078,4.9269,2.3904,1.6249,0.0409,0.5683,3.9233,13.4763,1.6709,1.6874,0.7527,2.9788,0.4709,6.6788,5.2519,0.1813,2.7273,2.9663,3.4574,3.3625,6.5118,4.6408,4.538,0.0952,0.0016,3.6996,0.002,1.4279,1.2608,3.4479,2.6166,1.2609,1.3058,0.7862,3.0663,4.3614,0.5519,0.6969,0.7496,0.6364,2.0277,4.1425,3.5912,1.2109,0.6774,0.1759,0.0055,0.9118,4.0563,2.0514,2.659,2.4742,0.9546,0.2711,2.192,0.9023,0.7339,3.2391,0.0327,4.4216,2.5428,2.8966,0.4437,1.5843,1.8133,1.8046,6.0248,0.0146,2.9912,3.5591,1.5996,1.3022,1.7971,5.4542,5.6249,2.6595,2.3715,0.475,3.954,3.9371,1.2984,2.622,0.0081,4.4383,1.7833,5.2172,3.285,4.2061,1.9306,2.4632,3.3221,1.7715,3.3188,1.5538,2.1024,2.9172,4.6753,1.2857,4.197,1.3375,3.4762,1.2401,3.942,0.4475,1.1275,0.0002,4.7387,0.1022,0.0012,5.2663,1.8762,1.5403,4.918,1.5527,2.1028,2.847,2.4154,1.1777,2.6943,2.3433,0.1014,5.7759,2.7364,1.4965,4.6461,5.2126,0.9977,6.0189,3.9423,4.4864,1.1529,0.6353,1.6602,0.8649,0.2323,0.5881,2.4729,3.6185,1.9262,1.8973,0.5084,4.4996,0.3211,2.4749,5.0382,0.6489,2.687,4.0618,1.4577,2.7601,0.0629,0.3584,1.3394,1.3331,0.4637,1.2448,0.0458,1.4902,2.6068,2.7273,1.8272,0.5672,0.0104,4.9058,0.2904,0.0035,1.8349,3.8878,4.3333,1.4234,0.4631,4.3016,2.7557,0.1417,1.3111,1.7884,0.6245,0.366,0.0002,2.4072,3.5272,6.0954,1.3401,2.0068,0.9016,3.5393,2.1155,4.1086,6.1466,0.0332,4.5802,0.7135,3.3814,6.215,1.624,0.8855,0.4252,2.2421,1.8583,1.7794,1.7199,1.2011,5.2107,6.8845,1.2472,0.1116,4.3994,0.8782,2.3319,0.9504,2.135,0.7123,7.5155,3.2324,3.3628,2.5684,1.3465,2.4846,0.3968,5.8229,0.1678,1.4761,5.3669,1.4856,0.175,1.1549,3.6545,1.1939,2.9525,3.2384]}

If the victim is defeated and killed by the ghost, that person's soul will vanish as well and the ghost will never recover.\n\nAnother reason for this is because after a person is killed by a ghost, their soul is sealed and cannot escape. Any attempt at trying to free their soul is met with defeat because the curse has stopped it. So the ghost is forever trapped in whatever the corpse is; a body or a box.\n\nIt is highly frowned upon to give anyone's soul away for free or to sell it. As a result, if a person dies, his or her soul must be repaid in some way. In most cases, this goes from a single item to the deceased's soul. It can also go in a number of ways.\n\nPeople have made some of the most astounding discoveries with the help of ghosts. Most examples of ghosts include things like having your shoes stolen, something that was never supposed to happen, getting a new job, having your family killed, losing your virginity, losing a loved one, and even being stuck inside something (such as a box ).","token_len":270,"entropy":[6.0348,4.5791,0.854,2.088,4.2705,5.7231,3.5455,4.6635,0.7415,3.4868,0.0057,3.7653,1.388,5.3817,0.9942,1.7144,2.8951,3.7537,2.1988,0.3614,0.0015,0.3444,0.7181,0.3458,1.7128,0.0101,4.879,0.0571,4.4148,4.612,0.9187,1.6166,1.5928,2.5914,2.6529,0.0038,5.4456,1.0167,2.2126,0.526,0.4531,0.6275,6.6391,1.2217,1.4253,3.6396,0.6488,1.4352,1.2072,2.2237,2.2695,5.8413,2.6654,2.2863,1.857,2.0366,1.97,0.4754,3.2181,0.7764,1.7766,0.8842,0.5321,4.6831,3.3819,0.227,2.8605,1.6231,0.6579,0.3747,1.9996,5.9719,2.3195,0.4158,0.0001,5.6366,3.1192,1.9976,1.6017,0.5688,1.4889,5.3883,1.3149,0.8148,2.0009,0.7675,1.446,0.7493,0.3212,0.1335,1.4691,0.6593,1.4094,3.3051,3.008,1.0655,3.4245,1.108,5.4931,1.4444,2.8339,5.0212,0.0286,3.4523,1.6689,0.0972,3.3032,1.3599,0.0639,5.9043,4.3039,0.9645,2.7648,3.0862,5.5718,2.7231,1.7455,4.6817,2.5955,2.4214,2.3736,3.2494,1.0573,1.1159,5.4843,4.3413,4.4428,1.4609,5.3938,2.1228,2.8931,1.9694,0.5121,4.9556,0.3886,0.2941,0.0002,3.7598,0.928,5.3298,5.7102,0.0265,0.6991,5.2014,3.7632,4.1578,0.9324,2.1189,2.8758,2.2832,3.2481,1.411,3.0692,1.3162,1.0598,4.7499,1.2296,0.7236,0.1258,3.4146,1.064,0.7686,1.0486,1.3328,3.9267,0.7994,0.0029,0.3598,3.617,0.1941,4.9008,1.3743,0.7367,0.2942,0.5866,3.7318,2.4622,0.1669,0.193,1.2478,6.2807,5.6844,1.3541,4.9932,2.7167,0.7746,2.2767,5.4485,0.7901,2.0206,1.481,4.053,2.5526,0.8081,2.7221,1.9503,2.8392,1.631,0.0022,0.9717,1.4439,1.0087,0.0002,5.4124,3.1829,4.924,5.149,2.8408,0.4502,0.6571,5.3229,2.3152,3.5147,1.1441,0.5448,0.0042,1.6789,0.4573,4.938,5.4183,1.3176,3.5433,5.5831,3.6753,0.4835,5.5826,3.389,4.7744,2.164,0.7886,5.8942,2.0259,2.2112,2.5646,2.2562,0.0022,0.2299,0.7094,4.1074,1.6346,2.5057,1.312,0.541,3.1231,1.7133,4.4225,3.5572,0.4063,3.467,1.2404,0.8491,0.2817,3.2978,1.8091,1.2036,0.0181,0.311,1.7785,2.0435,2.3069,5.0456,2.516,3.9281,4.7907,2.5925,0.004,0.2399,1.1073,8.5866]}

So you can make up words for your lengthier extracts.","token_len":270,"entropy":[6.5965,1.9361,0.5053,4.1061,5.3477,0.2297,3.8398,9.3393,4.568,1.8152,3.4078,4.0429,4.1649,10.5747,0.1625,0.2016,1.9672,3.4686,5.724,0.3574,3.4897,1.1739,2.5981,1.2897,3.8645,0.3565,2.6538,4.1678,3.8361,9.6232,5.8934,3.212,8.1125,0.4079,10.5968,7.9967,8.7669,0.8486,0.0413,3.8977,4.0338,4.4912,0.0128,4.6724,8.229,1.6783,1.704,6.8014,1.2493,1.9861,5.8818,1.7212,1.1975,8.4145,3.8311,2.2032,5.787,1.2981,0.9324,1.7482,1.2424,8.3512,0.8058,5.4725,4.7275,2.7191,1.6761,2.2018,1.1249,1.2503,0.1404,4.1202,2.9065,4.1217,0.1671,0.6556,2.9779,0.3976,5.2916,5.4634,3.1366,1.049,4.14,3.704,4.3296,1.6134,5.5767,1.4072,1.9623,1.6513,2.6538,5.2387,1.6347,0.7206,1.3477,1.6247,1.2777,1.5289,3.8601,2.742,1.274,1.3266,1.0371,3.5221,0.5644,3.5567,1.5595,5.3175,0.0054,0.7056,4.5838,2.4326,5.0747,2.2046,0.1162,1.0973,0.7927,7.3623,4.6499,6.6275,2.2671,4.4518,1.4667,0.0039,0.0412,5.2783,2.9852,0.6936,0.037,4.7735,4.1203,1.549,0.4478,0.0071,5.3417,1.4083,6.0413,1.106,2.8026,4.0563,1.4764,4.7423,0.6929,1.0578,1.8435,1.3007,4.2298,2.1817,0.4063,4.9466,5.116,2.5377,1.9868,4.1464,2.6525,3.5417,1.3072,1.7773,1.679,0.9694,0.7637,1.2528,3.0993,1.9439,2.6339,0.8734,3.4609,1.5318,1.4761,1.3279,1.622,1.7037,3.3964,0.0234,3.9969,4.7995,6.197,1.9354,4.4504,0.7078,1.6032,2.769,1.4405,0.606,0.1535,1.7886,0.0598,0.2946,0.0727,0.0083,0.4129,0.0726,0.2819,0.0723,0.0016,0.3772,0.0265,5.5661,1.3727,1.7769,4.3803,2.9166,1.9787,0.0803,1.1749,1.4626,1.2277,4.5375,5.2509,0.1469,1.4494,1.0162,1.1753,2.6459,3.3483,1.5737,2.0838,2.0318,0.2083,4.5656,2.0766,4.8483,0.3711,1.8863,0.0551,0.0697,0.007,0.2681,0.0342,0.0698,0.0142,0.0023,0.2463,0.0204,0.0594,0.0153,0.0007,0.4045,0.0227,3.0164,2.3342,1.3242,0.3122,3.1659,0.1762,4.2634,0.3197,0.6723,1.9402,0.053,0.1916,1.0006,0.0218,0.0088,0.2638,1.4656,0.2239,3.084,1.3583,1.3983,2.8507,1.4233,2.3601,3.416,2.3097,6.7411,3.283,0.5017,0.576]}

There are other guardians for spirits that have never had someone to help them, the way to give the spirit some peace of mind is for your guardian to help them.","token_len":279,"entropy":[4.9645,8.6478,0.1884,0.051,0.4342,6.2785,11.251,0.3011,0.9352,4.0382,9.9453,2.5245,4.5747,1.2485,0.6985,4.7492,0.7615,4.3149,0.0293,2.2968,0.3759,2.1469,0.0076,0.0384,2.7614,3.9026,1.4293,1.0126,0.5759,4.3055,0.3682,7.9129,0.789,2.099,0.0137,5.253,0.1058,2.8504,0.3481,1.9485,0.6399,1.5152,1.5554,2.4996,1.1364,4.7316,1.5815,0.2247,8.2314,0.0001,2.8079,4.0806,0.332,0.5394,0.4897,0.0783,0.0038,3.914,1.4414,0.1976,3.3005,5.5624,1.4817,1.8807,1.0215,2.8675,2.2393,0.5372,1.678,0.9629,0.4278,0.0001,4.6958,5.3071,2.4265,1.6711,2.4208,0.228,2.2854,1.449,0.7831,4.4561,2.8564,1.0349,1.5565,3.2657,1.8132,1.8004,0.2528,1.0841,3.4058,0.0953,0.7043,2.8863,2.9908,2.9092,1.2596,4.7594,0.0002,1.4454,1.6107,0.1737,1.0782,3.4925,0.3237,0.3474,3.6807,0.2997,2.7538,1.6672,3.925,0.1015,3.7528,0.99,1.8053,2.483,0.3985,1.7504,3.1357,0.7487,0.8347,1.2505,0.6458,2.1536,1.8353,1.6451,3.6998,1.6447,5.5728,4.0275,5.2622,0.7236,1.4152,5.4722,1.0583,5.1624,3.6482,2.0048,0.9204,5.731,1.6742,6.1708,1.2428,3.3788,6.6069,0.642,0.0001,3.5822,2.5401,4.423,1.0096,3.527,0.1545,2.0299,1.7445,4.8351,1.1543,5.1532,1.4799,5.1969,0.183,3.3329,1.3734,0.1452,3.7179,1.0515,0.6902,1.6997,1.0313,1.8589,1.8418,3.3172,3.7179,2.2637,1.7379,1.7999,2.9227,6.6712,2.459,1.4574,0.3725,4.2409,0.0002,4.6251,4.4499,3.0589,0.8134,3.9216,3.9207,2.3697,4.1847,1.0642,1.7028,0.6962,1.5133,2.4907,0.255,0.8752,2.8732,0.5002,2.0994,4.5071,4.811,0.9978,5.3113,5.0222,1.1428,2.5582,4.6055,2.5455,1.7919,0.2493,1.965,7.1128,2.1374,5.3979,2.4749,0.8815,4.0461,3.3222,0.0606,3.688,1.9914,1.6201,1.8796,1.0078,4.4498,4.2327,1.5414,0.8258,0.4002,0.0002,3.207,0.9794,2.4905,4.4381,1.6837,2.3829,4.9398,0.632,5.1527,0.9241,1.1257,0.1798,2.0439,4.6324,0.9287,2.6928,4.2223,2.2471,3.0592,2.7068,2.3882,4.3825,2.7575,4.5349,0.8898,0.5597,0.0758,1.7103,5.3707,4.2975,3.0658,5.461,3.3896,1.3763,2.7914,3.2872,2.216,0.0055,0.6226,2.6072,1.7228,0.1238,0.0554,1.9113,2.6184,1.2078]}

She found it very emotional because she couldn't understand why this wasn't obvious when she was 18 - she shouldn't have had to know about her great-great-grandmother having a husband, a living daughter, a dead one - she's right there!\n\nWhat Makes a Family Tree?","token_len":281,"entropy":[10.4036,2.3918,7.2245,11.4484,3.208,4.5802,4.4841,1.0121,5.2802,4.7491,2.3323,6.238,10.0686,1.5813,3.4384,0.4148,2.0469,7.0584,6.676,3.8943,0.7233,3.9959,3.9401,2.0204,0.6683,1.576,0.3389,4.4828,2.8713,0.2723,6.0743,3.4301,3.9753,2.2086,0.6499,2.8306,0.0151,5.5189,4.4246,4.7739,3.9074,1.3663,3.4146,1.893,2.1523,3.3179,1.7955,1.2965,5.2158,1.4128,0.8077,1.9983,3.0175,1.7317,2.6899,1.4719,1.8158,4.1717,0.0009,1.0498,0.6858,0.2053,1.2334,3.7591,1.7131,7.6611,1.553,4.7003,4.8741,0.1854,1.1098,4.4629,3.1805,2.5581,2.2188,0.0415,0.447,1.2255,1.3146,0.8901,2.4988,1.113,2.2878,0.5438,2.7268,1.6622,1.7004,1.3797,3.0139,4.5175,0.0926,4.845,0.4219,1.8443,0.1086,0.1265,1.2141,6.4484,2.3087,1.1791,2.0891,4.3232,4.3019,1.9823,0.83,0.8197,0.0002,3.6639,1.4279,3.6338,0.4067,5.1949,1.7065,0.7381,4.79,1.3557,0.3134,0.3752,1.0474,1.3897,3.1826,1.6585,0.9163,1.1244,1.7306,0.9403,0.7532,0.1292,1.705,0.4169,4.2497,1.0054,4.3901,3.9418,0.0849,1.2404,0.9311,5.025,1.1582,0.2562,1.0641,0.4634,1.4059,6.6058,1.608,0.0659,3.3195,1.1945,3.219,0.1042,3.7842,2.8596,0.8768,0.2142,0.0342,0.3891,0.2524,0.0754,3.5804,4.0876,2.8942,6.4431,5.7505,4.7108,0.8016,2.4504,0.024,4.0337,2.5275,1.2382,0.8641,0.6519,0.0584,0.7298,0.6001,3.1521,1.4573,0.0649,0.6854,2.2517,0.1514,0.388,0.0002,1.4517,0.0149,5.035,0.472,1.8109,7.0388,2.6208,0.4947,0.6784,4.6691,2.1449,1.427,3.2071,1.6255,1.4611,4.8274,2.9545,0.9546,0.0622,3.9434,2.4228,4.7285,0.8555,0.754,1.1835,1.117,3.8208,4.5547,0.0989,1.7239,0.5639,0.2987,1.3252,0.6468,0.2624,6.1374,0.2982,2.271,4.3932,1.9561,2.5714,5.5779,4.0664,0.5473,3.3867,0.0004,2.528,0.8662,4.2478,5.5947,0.0004,2.8258,3.1891,0.2333,0.4804,4.9243,3.792,2.1438,6.2109,0.0005,0.1426,2.2004,0.9793,3.9368,2.9157,1.2452,0.5604,0.4553,0.3381,1.7707,0.3073,0.6651,4.8247,1.1532,4.3143,2.2029,1.619,6.1474,2.0316,0.5456,1.6786,3.3404,3.8754,3.3771,2.1103,4.0802,6.088,0.8008,2.8865,0.5444,0.0002,4.496,5.655,1.3698,1.7662,2.0578,1.6275]}

'' \"\n\nTag was in the newspaper business until the mid-'70s. At his own expense, Tag wrote ''I'm the Law,'' a book about criminal-custody procedures.\n\nTag also contributed to an early newsletter on law and criminal procedure, called ''The Law and its People.''\n\nTag was a strong advocate of free association and free speech, and he opposed mass-conviction cases for minor offenses, such as public drunkenness. In 1987, he led a fight to keep the state from using ''stingrays,'' devices that mimic wireless towers and trick mobile phones into revealing their locations.\n\nTag was a long-time member of the American Civil Liberties Union and a member of the Washington chapter's executive committee, which included John Ashcroft and James Q. Wilson, who will be its president, early in the week. Other board members are Thomas Carper, D-Del., Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and William J.

Then, you're going to do it better.\n\nThat's what has kept people who were miserable for 40 years doing what they knew would make them happy for as long as they lived. A few of us have lived to 85 now.\n\nNow, the more difficult things get, the more our lives have gotten out of balance. When we have a choice, we tend to focus on the important things.\n\nWe are so used to having a problem we have to solve that we have made some of the key decisions.

But when you've made these kinds of decisions all your life, it's so easy to forget the way your life will end, sometimes without you even knowing it.","token_len":289,"entropy":[10.8164,1.479,7.0118,1.9713,6.7404,0.277,3.3877,0.7918,10.5919,3.1054,0.0946,2.2158,2.1475,0.0274,6.3435,1.914,13.5483,12.9369,7.3904,0.3056,1.7339,0.4154,5.9931,1.6833,1.3515,0.594,7.5093,6.4258,0.5618,0.6005,1.6555,4.7004,0.2775,2.1921,1.3224,0.543,0.0156,0.2885,3.6998,0.9998,3.5281,2.7873,1.8681,0.008,1.6609,1.3682,6.1762,1.8549,0.0838,2.3732,3.8796,1.522,0.5128,5.5021,2.962,2.7674,3.6724,2.9441,0.2715,0.9181,0.6121,1.6116,0.0001,1.8828,2.9903,2.1284,2.5372,0.9892,0.7865,2.2539,1.4214,2.6006,0.0321,3.5025,0.6143,1.9443,3.0268,2.6633,0.6908,0.2029,0.6442,0.2433,0.5561,0.0001,5.7568,1.2017,1.5771,3.4458,0.9938,1.8439,1.6433,0.0364,0.8429,0.8199,0.0001,4.0873,5.7014,1.792,0.2824,4.5104,2.2523,2.9572,0.1869,5.0354,3.3416,0.9455,0.4096,0.5014,3.3235,0.5258,0.4334,4.5372,1.6025,2.0105,4.4732,2.3924,0.0029,4.0095,1.645,3.0437,1.1508,0.7799,0.0002,4.5375,0.4043,2.0582,5.8366,4.5298,5.5091,3.5288,2.2637,3.812,1.4821,4.8343,0.0797,3.7239,1.8133,0.2046,7.021,1.7173,0.7576,0.0347,0.3709,1.1727,4.2066,0.0392,0.0181,0.2012,1.9302,0.1424,6.7254,2.5089,1.7819,3.6091,1.6034,3.4017,1.8811,5.9133,6.0266,0.6275,1.8995,0.0002,4.7736,0.8597,3.4901,5.7404,3.8287,3.2111,0.7617,0.1929,0.0329,0.3252,4.6162,2.5989,2.6472,3.883,2.6548,0.0057,0.4143,0.2778,4.3323,1.295,2.8899,1.6617,1.2856,1.2434,0.3126,2.5671,0.0369,3.883,0.1804,0.6004,5.5504,0.6041,0.6537,1.7622,0.0002,2.1265,3.9923,3.3956,1.7033,0.0084,2.5921,1.9282,4.6514,3.105,2.1564,0.4963,1.0958,0.6765,0.2866,3.1208,5.943,4.8157,1.9046,0.7848,5.0519,1.4255,4.0278,1.5231,1.2832,1.7902,3.0154,0.9236,5.4707,0.1824,0.0456,5.7716,0.9522,0.739,2.172,3.2645,3.2015,2.1654,5.8307,1.7878,0.59,0.0002,1.9669,2.8598,1.2663,1.0902,0.3959,2.0868,0.3935,0.5832,2.8516,1.3698,0.5488,0.0002,3.6079,0.3956,5.606,4.7354,0.4599,2.3196,2.7052,2.2555,3.3,0.5395,2.6605,3.1017,0.0028,0.4227,2.8342,0.7009,0.0282,0.1695,1.8197,0.6648,5.5617,0.6895,0.093,2.6635,2.5546,5.2773,3.058,0.5706,3.9631,3.086,3.3395,6.8833,4.6104,1.4414,0.4355,1.5709,0.3924,0.2144]}

The light and sound go together, and each night, it's different.\n\nThe birds sing, and the moon shines.\n\nIt is a season with so much joy and happiness.\n\nA beautiful poem on the Song of the Night time by William Ernest Henley, 1847 :\n\nFor our pleasure, now we will sing,\n\nWhile the moonbeams dance on our cheeks,\n\nAs the birds sing in the trees and the bees wax\n\nIn the grasses and the leaves.\n\nThe song of the evening and the song\n\nOf the day's shadows are the same.\n\nThey may be the same in sound,\n\nWhile the moonbeams dance on our cheeks,\n\nAs the birds sing in the woods and the bees wax.\n\nTheir colors are varied, but they all\n\nHave the same melody.\n\nThey dance each night,\n\nThe song of the night time.","token_len":295,"entropy":[9.1245,1.9163,3.8635,3.7607,8.4333,6.5365,5.3754,1.5593,4.897,2.6973,5.3008,0.6176,5.1072,0.1282,0.4278,0.0091,0.7257,2.6928,8.8637,3.0734,3.9211,1.2563,2.7294,1.9172,4.4271,3.4314,4.3836,0.6151,7.3349,0.8468,5.1604,0.8299,1.1843,2.7856,0.9328,1.1334,3.1149,1.102,5.0404,3.5505,0.7708,0.3741,0.8615,3.7471,1.1811,4.0546,10.8006,1.1396,1.3987,4.2767,2.5324,1.7283,2.1811,0.012,2.4115,4.2599,3.7625,1.8895,5.7939,5.6297,2.9113,0.8941,3.6753,0.3407,1.2948,4.5199,0.456,1.7346,0.0001,2.0279,5.15,0.3268,1.2298,2.9249,6.9036,2.8509,2.4026,0.0002,5.1925,3.4568,5.4124,1.1941,2.1177,2.1716,6.0497,1.9937,0.8693,1.6109,2.7832,5.8035,0.8984,3.6823,1.1789,1.2032,0.4813,5.8778,0.3179,0.4929,2.2355,4.8227,3.1181,2.917,6.9123,0.8462,2.0809,1.7689,4.6583,4.6798,2.0493,3.3767,2.0905,3.7648,0.3689,1.2005,0.0002,1.2587,6.1926,0.8924,1.8588,2.0514,0.4135,2.2477,2.0338,1.737,0.2063,0.0001,3.5323,1.3842,1.6334,4.6858,5.1982,4.3794,0.6537,3.6399,0.9744,3.2019,0.9427,0.8923,0.0001,3.5154,4.6694,5.8861,3.9818,0.6999,3.1898,0.0442,0.0598,0.0913,1.3343,2.7037,4.234,4.3683,0.0083,0.0079,2.3328,2.5409,4.0066,5.4722,0.2429,0.0002,5.0432,5.2434,4.0871,1.4856,4.9771,2.852,3.9607,0.7172,1.8985,0.2932,0.0003,5.2237,0.6144,1.3137,4.07,0.0031,1.9737,2.4507,3.2395,3.1843,0.6478,0.0318,0.0003,3.4195,1.5041,2.1802,0.9094,2.0524,0.1778,1.9867,2.6325,0.335,3.2797,6.0297,2.2531,0.0004,1.0063,0.2444,3.2238,2.4262,1.7373,0.407,3.1692,1.6369,0.2314,0.0001,1.7983,2.2121,0.5634,0.1406,3.2207,3.4957,0.3661,0.6773,4.5977,0.0002,0.2088,0.1595,2.6721,3.7333,5.1966,2.1858,2.1525,0.5703,0.8213,0.0918,0.0001,2.5199,5.1403,0.8178,3.7826,0.3279,2.7906,2.1345,0.5424,1.0981,0.0002,6.791,1.297,2.3069,0.66,0.0008,0.3417,0.2232,0.0225,0.0233,0.4395,0.0212,0.0002,0.9241,0.0436,0.1639,0.0191,0.0431,0.0093,2.6228,0.1228,0.1505,0.2273,0.8006,1.3071,0.0875,0.0002,5.5204,5.8395,0.7327,5.0678,0.6306,2.025,1.7206,1.9878,1.5428,0.0002,2.3375,1.0314,0.0726,2.4162,0.7146,0.0831,0.0001,1.9603,4.4317,5.8059,0.7803,1.4972,1.3065,0.0002,3.4075,2.4954,0.0937,0.1499,1.1935,1.9846,1.0649]}

If the solution is a yes the answer to the whole riddle has been revealed which will set up the rest of the story.\n\nA character riddle is a simple puzzle without any obvious answer - no answers exist in the riddle which are so clear that they can be put into words.\n\nThere are three main parts of a character riddle:","token_len":302,"entropy":[7.6185,8.7403,0.1683,6.1129,0.5079,3.4578,0.0091,2.0045,3.3624,2.5708,3.9136,0.831,0.0592,2.0757,0.2831,6.2925,0.2076,2.2617,1.2197,0.5074,1.8697,2.1792,0.0593,2.6492,0.2286,4.5331,0.0003,0.5224,1.138,0.0096,0.1273,1.4104,0.021,4.8855,1.9991,5.585,5.2982,3.102,0.6024,3.3311,0.4454,5.5512,2.8255,0.7516,0.8256,0.5927,1.9924,0.0055,4.4075,5.1353,2.1235,4.0122,2.5062,3.6497,1.9259,0.0026,2.2725,0.7475,1.6814,2.2945,3.5169,2.9522,2.0542,4.2375,0.1513,1.2685,5.3522,2.1835,2.1857,3.3434,1.0904,2.0433,0.1638,0.0017,1.3938,2.9435,5.3158,0.0532,1.6304,3.1586,2.5237,4.3453,0.4315,1.3587,5.5521,0.0069,2.808,2.6223,2.1578,0.3198,0.9372,0.0002,2.4324,6.3912,1.9512,0.1499,1.2528,1.3183,5.7042,2.2843,3.0066,4.9226,4.5356,1.3182,0.4259,1.0581,0.0002,4.8126,4.0542,4.1554,0.8585,1.0733,3.569,0.8893,1.584,0.2383,1.1735,0.2445,0.0014,2.8227,4.539,4.2704,2.035,1.7229,0.0737,0.8298,5.1367,1.6092,0.5704,4.3973,2.4995,5.1707,0.0252,3.3258,0.3733,0.0394,2.1651,1.0065,0.4125,0.5125,0.1928,0.884,0.7501,0.0002,4.2172,4.8686,4.7744,0.0919,1.9797,1.5247,1.9578,3.9654,5.3576,2.4073,0.0035,5.7768,1.6882,0.3953,2.4218,0.1099,0.426,1.6287,3.3008,2.9094,0.3759,1.6119,1.5102,2.1741,3.0661,0.034,0.4317,2.8904,1.2865,2.9098,0.4339,3.3591,0.847,0.4424,0.21,4.8253,3.4338,1.489,0.0042,1.2268,0.0799,0.3284,3.2569,1.4615,5.2032,8.8854,1.7659,0.0313,5.1607,6.0934,1.4175,0.9093,1.6299,0.8204,0.7265,0.0062,0.285,3.5654,0.5543,0.8877,0.9327,2.7917,1.5502,5.7661,0.3413,0.2244,0.391,0.0002,2.072,5.4596,0.53,0.7041,0.246,1.0332,0.2881,0.0013,0.1135,1.0108,2.7078,1.3047,0.0949,0.1181,0.0009,0.4136,2.919,0.3282,1.6725,0.7091,2.3248,5.5221,4.9865,3.3106,1.3185,0.0139,6.7093,0.172,0.0004,2.2317,0.0854,3.3333,7.3171,3.4884,4.792,0.8791,0.6432,2.9707,0.0072,0.0077,0.3047,0.2368,1.6537,0.0002,2.156,0.8682,0.7045,0.0023,1.3066,1.9539,4.3823,1.7507,4.4107,1.4028,3.2065,3.2197,5.3621,4.7605,5.374,4.3995,2.2736,0.3093,3.3903,0.0099,3.3036,2.1806,4.3932,4.176,0.8081,1.6664,1.316,0.1982,5.5299,1.19,1.1794,0.4966,1.1127,0.0002,4.2153,0.2426,2.3613,1.7122,4.2893,1.1946,0.1854,0.2488,0.0605,0.0009,0.3533]}

{"id":2134,"ended":true,"length":285,"gen_text":"There is a demon for every sin, today for the first time ever someone has committed your sin. \"\n\nIt was in the year 1410 or so that the first Catholic Pope, Raymond of Canterbury, visited England for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth I, and to celebrate the occasion he consecrated Henry VIII's new chapel in Westminster Abbey as the Papal House of Heaven. During his six day stay in England he made a strong and lasting impression, and during his entire visit he and King Henry were accompanied by four Cardinals who, together with the Pope, presided over the coronation of Elizabeth and the coronation of Henry VIII on St Peter's day. Three of them would be responsible for the beginning of the Catholic faith in England.\n\nAt a ceremony on the west side of the Abbey in the early hours of this morning, an ancient tomb was opened, opened again and, after a solemn prayer, the relic of St Anne of Enghien was discovered, taken to a room, made some of the other relics of the saint available to the Cardinal and buried. Later on, when the ceremony was over, some of the relics of St Anne of Enghien were taken to Leicester House, next to where Henry VIII lay buried. Amongst the relics taken with the Cardinal were St Anne's own golden crown which, although later lost to history, was subsequently recovered in a Catholic church at West Bromwich in the mid eighties and is now on display in the St. Peter's College Museum.","token_len":304,"entropy":[1.4132,1.2924,9.3838,5.7708,0.969,3.9047,1.4563,10.0525,5.4588,2.579,1.3381,0.0187,3.9745,5.9092,1.4593,4.6832,7.1907,1.9637,2.1854,5.1045,1.9018,0.0275,4.3326,2.1608,4.1657,1.428,4.3718,4.0108,4.1891,5.376,2.5385,0.5869,1.1274,2.0002,5.1549,4.4917,0.8757,5.9792,3.2326,2.9446,0.2943,4.8863,2.4568,3.689,0.2861,3.8593,0.0004,0.0657,2.8455,0.1767,0.3383,2.1148,1.1488,4.4665,2.053,0.7375,2.0977,0.8541,4.5956,0.0011,5.4605,0.8092,1.0456,3.208,2.249,1.6567,1.0049,0.083,2.0327,0.7901,4.9657,0.0065,4.4403,1.2991,4.9031,0.2903,5.1704,1.1021,6.0524,4.4976,0.8345,0.9574,0.5294,1.7835,3.3803,1.2002,5.9751,3.4298,2.4425,0.0957,3.0516,1.2246,4.1918,0.6061,5.7818,1.8804,0.9703,5.0912,4.942,0.1432,2.8796,4.8166,0.1115,5.1149,3.0561,3.2966,3.4664,2.8072,0.3443,1.0112,1.5979,0.2916,3.9357,0.2921,0.1764,1.3671,0.0116,1.5958,1.3857,2.4549,1.2614,1.1423,0.0403,0.1355,1.336,1.0573,3.9408,4.2841,2.7477,0.0083,1.623,0.8478,5.8907,0.2177,2.2019,4.3621,2.104,4.5331,0.0519,0.649,5.1106,0.0606,0.2122,3.0447,5.6695,0.1849,0.2249,1.083,0.5699,0.0004,4.2914,4.0106,3.5719,2.1663,1.2484,5.4619,0.4795,0.0122,0.4012,1.0334,2.8139,1.0471,2.0545,1.4187,0.0213,5.5743,0.6492,0.5896,5.2444,3.5015,4.3439,1.2095,0.5379,1.3518,5.3283,1.3213,1.2486,4.2984,2.3331,1.1131,3.0662,1.653,0.4471,1.1748,4.4805,0.086,0.6736,3.6959,2.3804,1.616,1.6003,0.1491,0.7847,4.3712,2.0992,5.0881,1.0047,3.155,3.0921,2.653,6.1814,5.8289,4.2838,0.5084,5.3411,0.3868,1.9608,0.7344,2.469,2.0336,0.9974,0.354,4.5254,0.9509,4.4908,2.0715,5.2932,2.1926,1.0344,2.6473,0.6395,2.9664,0.4406,0.4765,0.2601,4.7755,0.6098,0.1079,2.5316,1.9727,0.7015,0.046,0.9007,0.0028,0.0009,0.0016,0.1875,2.016,0.9326,6.4559,5.6372,1.0311,6.4597,0.5665,4.9746,2.162,0.4353,4.7535,1.2058,1.3921,6.07,0.9888,0.8093,0.5483,3.6928,3.8884,0.5513,1.1195,1.7088,4.4171,0.3775,0.0769,4.5324,4.9692,2.7964,3.334,2.9914,4.0011,5.4856,1.5677,2.5845,1.3403,0.0734,1.1044,5.4373,2.4202,2.3396,2.1991,5.6586,2.0781,3.6623,5.5481,1.7105,0.0265,2.13,1.4036,3.6632,5.0351,0.169,1.7283,1.9692,0.4673,1.0747,0.2726,0.8002,0.5969,4.3078,3.2042,2.9472,0.0356,4.8121,1.4607,0.5615]}

Some of the most imaginative pieces of fiction I've ever read\u2026 I highly recommend that anybody who loves SF start here instead of at the beginning of any series.\"\n\n\u2013 Mike Resnick on Twitter","token_len":305,"entropy":[6.068,4.5303,0.0199,5.0738,7.6538,14.3054,2.2779,7.7164,6.4303,9.22,2.3757,0.0874,5.7049,3.5012,1.0162,2.4686,0.895,0.1694,0.2466,3.6591,3.6132,0.2355,4.4428,0.9171,5.9898,1.0799,0.0984,0.1105,0.0002,2.5966,5.8912,5.6819,6.6132,0.2212,5.4512,0.3072,0.0111,0.1515,5.6287,4.4318,0.016,0.1012,0.0002,5.8342,3.7743,0.0148,2.2795,0.038,0.801,4.2053,0.0513,0.895,0.0018,2.7866,4.1135,0.0136,0.0461,0.0002,1.547,4.6214,0.2641,3.7867,0.0599,3.4155,0.8326,2.725,0.2374,0.041,0.6499,0.0014,3.112,3.2622,2.2035,0.1366,0.0017,2.4665,4.0265,0.0721,2.3751,0.0252,0.2552,0.0002,3.631,5.2357,5.8985,0.0,1.5712,0.2882,0.038,0.6667,0.9048,3.1861,0.0475,4.9415,4.6322,7.0205,0.113,0.0002,2.9055,3.973,0.0401,0.8365,0.0451,3.6945,0.0018,0.0025,0.0409,3.1588,4.5629,0.1635,0.09,0.0002,2.7601,5.388,0.0023,1.6928,0.0408,0.6438,3.0985,0.0223,2.3611,4.0563,2.7369,0.0615,0.0002,2.0749,4.1737,5.2796,0.1093,6.2346,3.9392,0.001,3.2895,0.1332,2.4616,3.0666,0.0534,2.6878,4.3552,0.4921,0.0679,0.0002,5.5671,4.628,1.4888,1.348,4.7969,0.589,0.6719,4.8317,0.0487,1.2398,0.0026,6.2175,0.1443,0.0871,0.0002,4.9543,2.6102,5.3988,5.4244,0.3592,5.9436,5.4441,1.3323,0.0077,2.4337,3.4123,3.1505,0.6293,0.0009,3.4377,2.1203,0.6759,1.2727,3.9834,4.7032,1.5383,4.871,2.3273,1.3269,0.6032,5.2256,3.9459,0.1966,1.9128,3.3137,2.142,1.7306,5.8084,1.5789,1.4089,4.5221,2.094,0.2112,4.461,0.3502,2.6818,2.1925,3.9058,8.0807,11.7716,0.4403,1.9492,3.5275,4.5195,1.845,0.8735,0.7041,0.0002,5.4543,5.1447,2.3571,5.6028,0.0324,5.4676,3.658,5.2173,0.4815,0.0002,1.1862,3.5283,0.2354,1.2839,4.9557,2.6215,1.6714,0.46,4.4154,2.6724,0.8517,3.3877,4.9913,1.6558,5.2392,0.0597,0.293,0.0004,2.1755,0.4553,4.8237,2.3765,1.8121,3.6707,0.2306,3.0371,1.5805,0.4434,0.4641,4.5832,1.9471,1.9168,4.4949,1.5052,1.3795,0.819,0.3313,0.662,5.4362,2.6238,0.0599,3.5313,0.0175,1.0657,6.0143,0.8096,0.2901,2.9805,4.7673,5.4502,0.5153,1.349,0.4232,0.0684,0.8964,0.3706,4.2047,3.1474,2.6361,0.081,3.7123,5.5713,0.874,2.7591,2.8152,3.7965,1.4843,7.5273,0.0217,5.151,0.4612,0.7,0.5294,2.9223,1.7705,0.8991,0.198,0.0002,0.0382,5.4067,0.8788,0.0011,0.4365,0.6684]}
{"id":2765,"ended":false,"length":298,"gen_text":"In an interesting twist, a demon summons *you* and takes over your body in the middle of battle. But only while *you* can defeat it! In this form, you also get to battle the demon, and that's where the fun really begins!!! The game ends on a cliffhanger so be prepared for *that*. Now for the fun part - the puzzles! The puzzles are fairly simple, and most of them offer multiple solutions. The game is also quite pick-up-and-play. On the other hand, the game doesn't emphasize that much on character development. Some characters aren't as interesting, with their personality being pretty stereotypical. If you want more, there's a lot of extra things available in the Extras menu, giving you even more options when playing! Final Thoughts: A great little game with some unique mechanics and some clever puzzles. It's definitely not for everyone, however. It's also one of those rare things where you'll have to read a lot of instructions to understand what's going on. Overall, it's a nice game to try out, especially if you're bored with the genre. So what do you think? Would you play this? Would you play it again? I'd probably play this again, only now with 3-D graphics. This is definitely one of those rare games that you'll want to play over and over. It's a classic that will hold a place in my collection as one of my top three RPGs.

With the latest version of the plugin, we introduced a feature that prevents you from installing plugins that modify the code during checkout.\n\nUsing the Checkout Hook plugin, you can easily implement this feature.

From there, we use the exit hook to remove the user from your processes, which will then prompt the user to start the checkout process again.

However, after what humanity knows as the Dark Plague, the last surviving human has taken over the city and made some of the key decisions.\n\nThe novel uses the idea of \"solar radiation\", a fictional element from the nuclear bomb era, to explain what happens to a planet from when it is very hot to when it has completely cooled, through the various stages of plant and animal life (trees, animals, fish), and the various \"nuclear winter\" scenarios.","token_len":310,"entropy":[4.092,4.0109,7.6632,8.1348,0.0059,4.6559,1.8234,4.7344,6.7002,0.2313,5.308,8.8097,7.0502,1.6335,2.0514,6.6779,8.2148,7.7324,0.9602,3.8702,2.0197,6.0187,1.5153,1.3089,13.4186,0.2876,0.1235,10.5223,2.0179,4.4857,5.1333,0.1791,2.7985,0.9341,0.8482,0.4316,1.9826,7.4154,1.0901,3.826,1.8689,8.1215,0.8433,1.8479,1.58,2.1556,1.1975,13.4227,0.3328,3.1142,1.5794,5.0409,1.8315,2.9473,0.0167,4.9901,0.071,4.6,2.1596,4.9687,0.533,2.8344,1.7229,4.436,5.0135,0.5442,0.0001,4.9507,5.0488,6.107,1.1638,1.6812,3.5331,4.0501,1.1137,1.616,3.6615,1.8367,3.1921,2.2924,3.1637,0.1958,5.1027,3.0869,1.4603,3.9897,5.458,5.5227,3.812,4.8112,4.7202,3.92,0.5172,0.0001,3.2754,1.2057,1.0699,4.1192,0.126,0.1972,0.0263,2.5812,2.1658,0.0437,0.9377,2.9219,2.0505,1.5971,5.0335,0.4358,0.8189,1.9049,2.0142,2.0477,4.2761,2.3992,0.8926,5.4898,0.1575,3.8006,3.3082,2.2685,1.2306,3.4501,4.4486,0.2972,0.8626,0.6262,2.2081,4.3988,1.1045,4.559,4.6142,4.7986,6.0,1.4524,0.901,0.0002,3.9241,5.3695,4.4557,4.0746,2.7906,0.5975,3.9117,2.7381,1.4672,4.6789,0.0245,1.167,5.36,1.2495,2.3408,2.7768,2.0076,4.5795,3.9287,2.9783,3.5949,1.3913,0.6303,2.3649,0.8492,2.0253,4.1749,1.8359,0.3118,0.5583,1.4596,4.8673,2.9297,5.6771,4.877,0.0053,3.9866,4.0867,3.2123,1.2546,1.5351,0.5498,0.8406,0.0002,4.3818,5.0989,1.9964,5.275,3.9717,3.651,0.3029,1.6386,2.6018,6.4416,4.523,0.7791,2.469,1.2713,1.9378,3.9804,4.4305,0.5904,1.4503,3.6304,1.1475,3.2108,1.1843,4.6968,2.0771,4.2177,0.6606,3.407,4.8764,1.0553,0.6627,2.1939,0.1019,3.4327,5.6652,6.2695,4.0166,0.1594,0.5441,5.4796,4.8892,0.9478,1.0333,4.1817,3.026,2.2069,3.8086,4.5276,3.2857,0.4077,0.8109,0.9517,4.7473,5.0959,3.4597,0.3623,4.4371,1.237,2.0438,0.344,0.0002,1.7285,2.1366,5.5713,1.5605,4.1414,0.1827,2.3878,5.041,3.5026,3.1297,1.6251,2.0285,4.7026,2.167,2.8678,0.9233,5.722,2.8539,1.5244,0.8171,1.0721,1.1009,3.2315,1.885,0.7624,2.0871,1.0214,5.845,5.7247,1.3394,0.9016,4.8153,1.7168,1.6378,0.7978,0.0614,3.2851,3.9605,2.1782,2.6465,5.7971,1.4495,3.9645,0.8871,0.1826,5.6479,1.7743,0.049,0.0669,4.382,5.4638,0.0728,1.3785,2.0441,0.5302,3.7346,3.0549,1.0716,2.4736,2.0876,5.2656,5.1897,0.5068,0.0988,1.2879,1.3997]}

Her husband has been bitten in the foot several times, as well as being robbed once on the way home from Bordeaux. [ 5 ] During Queen and Country's stay at Porthcawl Castle Natalie, who has visited Bordeaux on several occasions, was bitten in the arm by a werewolf. This led to her transformation into one.

Her husband, with a blood transfusion from a werewolf, survived, but Natalie's condition deteriorated, and she was admitted to the Queen and Country in Porthcawl Hospital.

She said that her daughter Frances O'Grady, the Queen's sister, is \"totally freaked out\" about her.

This is the one we are most familiar with, and it looks very familiar due to that fact as well.","token_len":313,"entropy":[5.9371,1.3296,6.5713,7.4713,0.6286,0.965,9.3426,0.0149,0.2047,0.9561,6.8656,0.0462,4.4878,0.6672,3.4219,5.09,1.762,6.4606,2.8245,7.5401,0.6618,2.0415,3.9108,0.784,7.3355,0.8043,1.3132,0.1492,1.0211,0.0024,3.534,6.0002,2.9772,3.5662,1.6238,5.1409,4.1085,4.2741,2.5588,1.5649,4.9367,5.5605,1.6311,1.2305,0.0001,2.3113,1.1929,0.2209,1.8321,0.0818,0.0003,0.0392,0.0865,0.0009,0.015,0.169,0.0041,0.048,0.0208,0.02,0.3527,0.1316,0.0067,0.0165,0.0019,0.006,0.0359,0.0045,0.0028,0.0025,0.0016,0.0036,0.0016,0.0097,0.6977,0.0001,1.2163,0.2523,0.0962,0.0155,0.0038,0.001,0.0023,0.0011,0.0079,0.0018,0.0004,0.0022,0.0059,0.1489,0.0001,3.7697,0.9686,7.4471,0.0541,2.5362,4.7988,1.0555,1.8268,1.6317,2.0891,3.1708,1.0882,6.6207,1.3976,4.7621,2.5152,4.6159,0.0348,1.0185,0.7804,0.9527,0.0002,1.6252,0.8141,0.5259,0.0857,0.0224,0.0085,0.053,0.1064,0.0477,0.0063,0.0041,0.0036,0.0081,0.0847,0.0002,1.0773,1.448,3.8835,0.9946,2.0583,0.0208,5.3671,0.1047,3.8618,1.1949,5.6794,0.7906,6.9124,5.5251,0.2837,0.472,0.0002,0.91,0.4779,2.0082,4.8644,2.5581,3.7507,1.0763,3.8975,0.0649,1.7016,0.6428,2.0217,2.6929,1.7944,0.3562,0.2205,0.0002,6.2594,2.3844,4.251,1.0212,4.3528,0.9311,2.1313,0.7234,5.1827,1.8928,4.1952,1.1666,5.1644,2.1102,2.6959,1.6559,0.1647,0.0002,6.1639,2.0924,3.912,0.2224,6.3853,0.7977,0.5849,0.0685,4.6444,3.9086,1.8596,0.9175,5.144,5.1657,0.7004,5.7715,0.3111,0.5796,0.2911,0.0002,1.6927,0.5265,3.6867,2.3504,5.553,0.9917,5.0998,5.2261,0.5288,2.3844,0.007,1.6865,5.3917,3.1462,4.2874,3.6067,0.1505,0.0002,1.4042,0.5016,5.9973,3.5194,2.1427,3.7231,6.6839,3.0377,0.0054,1.3346,1.1256,4.3412,1.5465,2.1007,5.4576,3.9808,4.791,0.5372,0.6464,1.5842,0.0049,0.0074,1.173,0.8879,3.8708,3.9894,1.4663,1.6119,4.6195,0.7712,2.1991,4.081,0.1688,2.5927,2.7097,0.6119,0.3038,1.2661,3.255,3.2312,0.5236,0.1849,0.1219,0.0002,1.1559,0.4564,4.0296,2.1783,4.1067,1.9795,0.2984,0.281,0.8878,3.0846,5.2287,0.1516,0.649,0.0548,3.7919,2.6296,0.1317,4.8514,5.0398,0.2701,1.5982,5.7402,0.8115,1.7132,6.1799,2.1299,3.0685,0.4308,3.4235,1.8214,1.8614,2.6015,4.7171,2.3483,0.713,0.2485,0.0066,1.2388,1.6403,1.2709,5.8306,3.7342,3.3509,7.2114,0.0117,4.4904,1.4931,6.5665,0.8543,0.6921]}

Criminals may now confess their crimes without punishment. You've been making the headlines for decades. Why would you want that? \u00a0Well, if you are the head of a Mafia-like organized crime family, you don 't want those crimes exposed, and that's exactly what the government is doing. As you can imagine, the law has become ridiculous. If you're a corrupt attorney, the law is not designed to protect the truth. It's designed to protect the criminal. And the only way the law was created to have any meaning was to have the protection of people who were supposed to enforce it; people who knew they had to be safe to tell the truth ; people who were willing to go to prison or risk serious jail time themselves to do it.\nA good government would have a \"whole lotta truth\" clause, but it would make your mouth go dry and you'd find yourself with very few people to argue with. And we now have a government that will give some of the most corrupt people in the entire world, the most powerful positions of power and authority, and for what? Not a damn thing. At least, not in the United States. And most Americans would agree. The truth is, Americans have no desire to live in a free society because they are only so happy under totalitarianism... and what's so \"evil\" about this totalitarianism? Just the tyranny of a tiny minority.","token_len":315,"entropy":[3.6896,2.5786,7.0119,7.5576,7.9673,4.8687,2.5348,3.279,6.1244,1.0552,4.1012,2.6183,5.0192,2.7229,0.443,1.4274,4.6084,8.425,1.5282,2.9868,0.0792,0.1953,2.922,1.6674,1.3923,6.6441,0.0118,4.9022,6.1538,7.8461,1.5529,0.2871,5.4427,4.7228,1.2069,5.5116,5.2194,1.7022,6.9334,2.8516,5.5503,1.3858,4.9677,1.8502,3.9294,3.6441,0.4798,2.088,4.5227,2.1617,7.5041,0.3688,3.7886,0.2666,2.6401,0.3489,2.2681,2.5219,3.1041,0.0613,0.8795,4.7933,3.6327,0.7498,5.1872,0.0469,2.128,0.4557,1.0536,2.0194,9.8145,0.2817,0.1173,4.4513,1.685,4.3383,2.5473,1.9504,3.5652,0.8666,0.9286,0.0649,1.6587,1.8316,1.1193,0.5241,0.9024,4.9829,1.9539,1.6753,1.7883,0.0979,1.4682,5.4442,3.1649,3.0899,5.7508,0.9245,3.1485,0.4405,2.407,1.1608,5.7014,5.4616,0.6139,3.1436,2.7838,1.2614,3.4605,4.3515,0.2053,0.8525,2.7335,5.2153,0.6398,1.5775,0.5894,0.1266,0.0449,0.1415,0.6487,3.3422,0.5381,3.3187,1.6628,3.0819,0.3538,2.551,1.8925,5.401,3.2304,1.239,6.2984,1.3212,1.8615,1.0219,0.3726,3.3461,1.6217,5.2641,0.1708,5.8764,1.9525,1.9527,4.0903,0.0035,3.6132,0.4344,6.1471,3.5857,0.6821,4.168,3.3628,2.4188,0.8972,2.314,5.7096,3.6281,3.5566,0.2377,0.0745,9.0173,0.5082,0.2012,1.5086,3.4004,0.0221,2.747,0.074,1.6138,3.9726,2.2394,5.5749,2.5779,0.071,3.5388,1.1272,1.958,1.2896,0.2052,3.3087,4.4429,3.8479,6.3366,1.7902,1.9751,1.8146,4.8362,4.4561,2.2313,3.7463,0.0007,1.8874,0.56,3.6933,2.0309,2.4454,3.2351,2.005,4.3827,5.5938,6.0782,3.6917,0.2718,2.1817,1.3392,0.8188,4.6168,0.8429,4.2806,5.1309,1.33,2.5771,1.7859,6.0321,0.3167,0.3256,3.355,4.7453,5.5211,0.8489,0.9325,1.1545,0.6696,4.4,5.1973,6.6962,1.6107,1.4778,1.0827,2.3593,0.8252,0.384,0.4739,3.7922,1.1921,2.6676,1.7746,2.7772,0.4507,3.1463,1.744,0.502,2.6316,1.7631,0.6929,0.9455,5.6213,1.2104,0.0921,4.9436,3.2591,1.5728,0.1202,0.4564,6.1102,1.3883,2.5054,0.3103,2.2279,0.8728,3.0422,0.0051,0.5053,3.1823,5.322,1.7973,3.453,2.3975,1.4221,2.8693,3.2716,0.6351,1.493,4.3202,1.5605,2.3905,3.7013,0.3327,3.7126,0.2507,0.0656,2.7271,0.7765,4.9028,1.2373,2.0272,5.8445,4.7335,1.5921,5.2608,5.0578,1.2322,6.0174,2.129,5.333,1.8287,4.754,3.8456,4.2902,0.0432,0.0394,5.1022,1.7392,0.1073,0.2564,5.2762,2.2145,5.6444,1.6037,2.1172,4.2461,1.7242,1.7816]}

If players don't want to be the game master, there is always a DM who will step into the role of the game master.","token_len":317,"entropy":[7.4859,4.0565,3.1598,3.4003,1.8713,6.0864,4.3028,8.3719,7.0609,7.9052,7.5091,2.3327,1.4686,5.4005,12.2844,3.0485,0.9582,3.6963,1.3325,0.491,2.5117,6.6018,1.9733,8.5461,2.6928,3.6148,4.0564,2.3007,1.2178,0.2928,2.4269,0.9093,1.1964,0.0115,5.72,4.9973,3.4922,0.1757,0.099,4.9898,2.7794,4.5424,5.3825,1.0508,0.2186,4.2401,0.8097,0.0002,1.9127,6.2488,1.5018,5.4831,1.2327,2.9219,0.0118,0.7411,0.0145,1.032,6.2718,1.3561,1.4725,2.95,3.4133,0.2414,5.1536,2.3555,1.9815,0.3248,1.0333,2.466,2.8636,3.5168,2.4073,1.8806,2.7724,0.8146,5.1425,2.3387,1.554,0.2552,1.2964,0.5957,2.6786,5.4086,1.2112,2.7913,3.7244,2.5221,3.0223,4.2547,4.9226,5.589,4.3283,2.3359,0.869,0.0176,4.016,1.5078,0.509,1.4039,2.4849,0.137,0.705,0.0002,1.7314,4.6947,3.0385,2.9087,3.496,3.1907,0.2933,3.2776,2.6383,6.0083,1.7368,2.8184,0.7341,0.0234,0.0408,0.1303,0.0162,1.1047,0.0095,1.4474,0.4337,0.2028,0.0118,0.0007,0.0006,0.1201,0.0105,0.0813,0.001,2.9247,0.1814,0.0002,5.043,3.288,0.0771,0.0119,5.3826,3.3987,1.3613,0.0597,5.0473,4.1565,6.3937,0.1651,7.018,0.4564,0.0002,1.6977,2.191,5.7855,1.8734,3.9347,4.3698,2.4033,4.4448,0.3542,3.9087,0.1042,1.4323,1.8703,3.5105,2.7699,4.5185,2.2184,1.6023,4.7228,4.214,0.0875,0.6913,5.1732,5.3763,0.6047,4.0734,2.1859,2.6806,0.1218,0.0164,3.5733,4.5132,0.3829,1.288,2.8956,1.6302,0.1042,1.9028,2.9548,2.4069,3.393,4.4135,0.3034,0.6951,0.0002,3.6836,2.0155,1.6553,1.4426,0.1219,0.4138,0.0368,0.0002,2.2071,5.5774,2.4212,2.913,5.2594,5.235,1.3094,4.3265,4.6968,0.326,4.632,5.2833,0.3182,1.2508,3.913,4.4531,3.9645,3.1102,2.2464,2.9554,3.1584,0.5301,0.4923,2.7896,2.0336,2.4402,1.7492,4.5789,4.6883,1.7934,1.6332,1.711,4.8839,4.49,2.9907,4.609,2.613,0.2706,4.2083,0.9376,0.225,2.573,0.0698,0.1646,1.1087,1.5704,0.0002,4.4816,3.7648,0.598,1.4479,4.6805,0.0882,3.5446,1.1473,4.3148,0.007,1.4565,0.0319,0.0002,1.6138,5.5532,0.5641,2.4246,5.91,1.0885,2.6255,5.5643,0.5023,1.8588,4.622,1.8626,4.4259,1.3872,1.5933,0.0114,4.4297,0.6655,1.706,2.2982,3.9267,1.8494,4.5393,4.2826,0.7048,3.7826,3.3903,3.359,0.0011,1.3046,0.1455,2.1107,4.0413,5.8569,0.7855,0.4752,4.1024,0.8065,3.8253,1.6401,4.5021,2.0356,1.4455,3.3186,2.9292,0.6621,0.1533,2.422,1.737,1.2886,0.0119,0.4616]}

At the same time, the agency is calling on residents to help by reporting dead birds to its tip line at (503) 224-8477 as they find them.\n\n-- Mike Rogoway\n\nmrogoway@oregonian.com\n\n503-294-7699\n\n@rogoway","token_len":318,"entropy":[11.1048,1.2226,5.4752,4.187,2.5035,2.8653,3.4134,0.5984,5.5223,2.7961,3.5087,0.9868,2.3367,3.0343,0.2886,1.5089,4.7733,6.5913,0.1021,5.0752,1.0973,1.2811,2.2268,0.0072,4.549,5.5236,0.6474,0.4633,0.0006,5.2393,4.648,7.9042,4.6744,0.1154,5.2597,0.7891,4.925,3.5991,2.3596,4.983,2.1865,5.8768,0.5873,2.1011,1.8349,2.5684,2.6989,4.6928,0.1862,2.8571,0.7581,3.4043,0.8378,2.0064,2.0476,0.855,6.1748,0.0333,5.1054,2.3604,7.677,0.2854,2.9673,2.6235,4.0311,3.0545,0.1265,3.6379,3.6979,0.1286,0.6316,0.3384,0.0003,5.1984,0.7185,2.4062,0.8581,6.4976,3.6788,1.8978,5.8612,2.2092,1.8173,0.4048,0.7465,2.3058,1.029,0.0666,1.303,3.5546,1.2058,0.3819,0.8775,3.5807,0.4173,1.9455,4.2483,0.1439,0.6734,0.0291,1.3363,6.2701,2.4045,2.0186,2.3021,0.2236,0.3688,4.676,0.6159,3.6316,1.5669,1.727,0.967,1.2738,3.0972,0.814,0.2912,0.0002,5.1709,5.117,5.8222,0.0006,2.0361,1.5849,1.4465,0.0353,0.0739,0.6212,4.3011,5.2348,1.0526,0.2621,2.9694,5.9629,1.5207,4.2352,4.3474,4.6069,1.251,7.4462,1.8023,0.4623,5.2368,0.7961,0.8133,4.6118,4.9769,0.7668,0.036,0.5272,2.0833,0.346,6.3123,3.8585,3.3051,0.6776,1.5888,0.5877,0.5737,2.824,1.2576,5.5128,2.2334,2.8901,2.7432,1.8435,2.9174,6.0282,4.0508,2.6616,4.9337,0.809,0.3731,4.8272,0.5263,2.8401,0.8659,2.6174,0.1722,0.2339,0.0003,4.8429,0.0344,5.479,1.9181,0.0925,0.4353,3.2138,4.8816,0.9095,0.2648,2.8027,0.9297,1.2991,2.4519,0.004,4.4854,2.0256,0.0027,1.6548,2.0294,3.177,2.4885,1.2478,3.1549,1.4725,6.2003,3.8651,0.222,0.7933,1.8269,2.129,4.254,6.2116,2.0842,0.6924,0.4955,0.0002,2.2888,3.3898,1.6009,3.2761,3.2188,0.0169,3.7336,0.8654,1.188,1.512,4.7103,4.1678,0.6052,4.4091,2.012,1.2882,0.4823,1.6348,3.1936,1.5826,2.0141,0.4123,2.5443,2.8721,2.8767,3.9857,4.4144,0.8946,3.8802,0.8284,0.8755,0.1729,2.2289,0.0603,0.898,7.7208,1.496,1.4167,0.011,0.0658,1.2306,1.0293,0.7651,5.4522,1.1052,3.108,0.2604,2.2235,2.1021,0.8633,2.4864,0.4076,1.1847,1.8626,3.9628,0.0173,0.6811,2.5144,1.0526,0.0135,1.9456,0.0054,2.8307,2.6265,8.3479,4.3074,3.0312,0.0377,0.272,0.277,0.0003,0.8809,4.4964,0.012,0.0001,1.0398,0.0004,0.0018,0.0004,0.0007,0.0011,0.0,0.0,0.0001,0.0024,0.0001,0.0062,0.0004,0.0004,0.0008,0.0004,0.0002,0.0012,0.0,0.0695,0.0003,0.0003,0.0,0.0002]}

{"id":4422,"ended":true,"length":317,"gen_text":"After waking up one day, you find that any text you read will glow red if the person who wrote it is no longer alive. The trouble begins when you start browsing the internet... your phone will randomly flash red whenever you see somebody you know who's been murdered, or killed in terrorist attacks. Eventually, your phone will light up green when you see a story about a happy family or family member's new job, and red when you see stories celebrating or commenting on tragedy. If you have any Android Wear devices in your house, your phone will light up red whenever you try to find out about the death of somebody you have no contact information for.\n\nFor people who suffer from epilepsy, their phones will light up red for any epilepsy stories, but only with a flash twice, and they'll need to wait a couple of minutes before a story will flash green again.\n\nFor people living with bipolar disorder, their phones light up red when they read bipolar stories, and light up green when they read stories about people with mental illness.\n\nFor people who live with epilepsy, some of the stories won't work in their devices, or they won't light up at all. This might not be something new. A few devices, like the Lumia 950, don't have enough juice to display all the colors of the rainbow.\n\nI'd assume that most people who experience red color blindness may not know about this, or may be unaware that it can go this extreme.

{"id":990,"ended":true,"length":316,"gen_text":"The Olympic Games now have one average person compete in each event, to better contrast the skill of the athletes. You're one of those average people, however no-one, including yourself, can figure out how you're absolutely dominating your event.\n\nHowever, that average is growing as more and more people get involved in athletics. Many people have heard of the great American distance runner, Jesse Owens. Many people have also heard of the amazing African sprinter, Usain Bolt.\n\nWith this increase in competition, the time and energy is also growing.\n\nIt is a very good thing for the sport of athletics that the Olympic Games has such a high amount of contestants, however we are not always so lucky. The more people are involved, the longer it takes for competition for each event to complete. If a contest was the same every year, for weeks or months at a time, it would be very slow. I am sure you can understand what I mean when I say that it can take weeks to complete some competitions. However, the Olympic Games will change that, there is so much more competition now, it is making the competition much more intense. People are now getting more involved, the Olympics is turning into a spectator sport. This will not only improve the Olympic Games, but it will also make it a much better spectator sport.

It's up to the kids to stop the shark, and together they can stop T and save the world.","token_len":331,"entropy":[8.514,1.5598,8.1462,2.3592,4.5706,7.0072,2.2588,5.4651,1.6147,3.9257,5.5383,0.4384,1.1564,3.8391,0.8842,0.581,0.01,0.6103,5.4202,1.1762,4.3145,3.3844,1.3032,5.3636,1.3884,3.6881,9.9835,0.3473,2.0848,1.5426,4.3801,5.1222,0.01,1.0927,2.7259,2.6744,1.6033,0.0097,3.8786,4.281,4.6684,3.1236,0.5079,2.2272,5.4445,0.4127,1.4361,3.2554,0.3199,0.9987,0.0076,0.7109,1.3475,2.8816,4.3931,0.8008,1.6403,3.774,4.4772,1.5017,5.2495,2.4447,1.854,0.0127,1.9602,4.3776,1.3559,3.0762,0.5616,1.5256,3.811,5.2247,0.265,0.6071,1.3749,0.2667,4.6692,1.3167,0.1519,0.0124,0.3195,0.3792,0.0001,5.7624,3.1455,0.1097,1.0668,0.3558,0.232,0.1238,0.0369,0.0321,0.0406,0.0539,0.0675,0.078,0.0868,0.0945,0.1032,0.113,0.1211,2.2315,0.0002,4.1747,5.2181,0.0112,4.3433,0.1778,0.5613,5.2819,1.1342,4.7819,4.6291,0.2321,3.0977,0.0029,0.5637,1.0453,1.1382,2.6521,1.0757,0.3291,2.5857,2.9406,0.0645,2.6687,1.1734,1.9712,3.0037,1.6062,3.9488,2.162,0.5994,0.6271,1.4607,2.641,2.5527,1.4383,1.2806,2.55,5.4209,4.0801,6.5145,0.8173,2.8515,1.1497,0.6693,2.6352,4.6677,0.2144,0.7843,1.5923,0.5062,0.3021,4.2755,0.7186,2.1266,0.9074,0.5767,0.152,0.1741,3.9216,0.4527,1.9826,0.9663,1.4056,4.6588,2.4555,1.564,5.3517,4.9279,3.9206,1.886,4.3709,0.0142,3.5521,3.462,0.4574,6.3989,4.7447,5.9165,2.2349,3.504,5.859,0.3776,1.871,2.2135,2.7717,2.7094,0.6164,4.2878,2.417,0.2877,0.9373,0.0002,3.9267,1.259,6.0947,0.4407,2.0985,2.9717,1.7151,2.726,4.3791,5.9236,1.8558,5.1288,2.4443,1.0656,5.3731,8.091,1.9353,6.1901,2.5298,4.4641,1.5049,5.0573,0.991,0.7767,2.6767,0.0002,5.3335,1.2774,2.9598,5.156,0.9995,0.7963,1.8609,0.0008,0.8639,0.2001,1.4451,4.3594,1.2584,0.2284,1.9025,5.0389,1.4356,0.9496,3.37,3.0918,1.4894,5.6845,0.6676,0.433,3.8278,0.1357,0.5049,2.2381,2.3332,3.9107,2.0528,1.1827,1.2042,0.6928,3.0019,0.8506,1.2318,0.0002,4.3132,1.9962,5.5025,0.5045,3.9258,2.2865,5.8455,0.6686,1.4226,2.2817,4.7643,2.3591,3.7477,1.2025,6.4508,1.7114,0.7704,0.7008,3.072,0.4233,0.3349,0.475,0.0002,3.3448,3.3259,6.3584,2.5154,5.3758,3.1835,1.7938,1.1163,3.7472,3.5907,2.8923,3.1267,1.4882,0.5071,0.5788,0.38,1.8269,3.3593,3.3778,1.7887,0.1952,2.6363,1.8285,1.6024,3.8153,0.8635,4.5366,0.6182,1.5618,0.0056,1.1463,2.7833,0.1253,2.7678,0.3577,0.732,1.7159,0.8593,5.0331,0.3609,2.6843,3.7828,4.1218,1.7568,1.418,0.6387,1.1957,0.4323]}

{"id":2271,"ended":false,"length":311,"gen_text":"Write a story that starts happy but turns dark without a discernible turning point................\n\nRead a story that starts happy and then makes you cry.................\n\nWrite a story that has four different endings...............\n\nWhen writing a short story that's set in Paris, the following are crucial elements you have to keep in mind:\n\n1. There are a ton of French films that are incredibly good at dealing with social issues, with gender, race, class, and any other number of issues. So try to think more about what issues you'd like to deal with in your story.\n\n2. A Parisian is the opposite of a Hollywood actor. We often fall into the same stereotypes that so many Hollywood stars fall into.... so try to think outside of the box and make your characters Parisian in any way you can. Think about the real Parisians and the real Parisians you know.\n\n3. Writing is very much like playing a sport where you want to win. When you sit down to write (or play) a story, think about the best way to put the characters in the most favorable light and try to find the best way to do the same at the end.\n\nWhen writing that perfect novel that is perfectly structured, that you hope to read when you're done, it's important that you make the very first draft as good as possible. This can be a lot of work but if you are willing to put the time in, there is little that can go wrong in the long run.\n\nNow what are you waiting for, go write!

The dragon is that creature. It lives deep in the deepest part of the ocean, far from anything light and has no enemies. It's a god, a god of the sea. In the days of days long lost to history, its power was unmatched and it was given a kingdom. The dragon is the patron of ocean travelers and ships. Though not a god, its powers make it a very fearsome being indeed. This book will feature all of the gods of the ocean, including one very unlikely deity for those who are into that sort of thing. A few of which include: Alaric the Great Lousebuzzer (Sea God of the Sea), Drinag the Blood Moon (Lion of the North Sea), and Nereid the Unraveling (Iriress of the Sea ) Other Gods to be released soon : Aries of the Sea (Sea Goddess of the Sea) Aries is a powerful creature and is known for her power to twist reality.

In a way, this goes back to your previous books, what we're doing, and there's so much information about the work, but it's so much of the work, it's impossible to know exactly what you're telling them. That's why there's so many layers to my work\u2014or what I'm telling them.\n\nThe most important thing is\u2014which is sort of one of the questions that I thought about most: Is it right for me to talk about my work? This is really just an expression of me, and I think I am really lucky to work in this environment where it's so easy to communicate that with strangers. As long as you have a lens, you have access to it, and if you have something unique you can send it out to places, then I think the message is right.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the October 2016 issue of U.S. magazine","token_len":340,"entropy":[9.9829,1.0828,6.8017,1.9783,0.0094,5.4256,5.1068,4.0764,0.7827,0.0408,2.7216,1.9955,2.1844,0.1283,0.0083,4.1936,1.6223,2.2441,2.8832,0.4904,2.7222,0.0344,5.7354,1.7294,1.5725,5.6482,1.8305,3.6441,1.0663,5.1319,0.3366,6.2335,5.3827,0.5097,1.6652,4.925,0.1545,0.4903,2.354,6.0594,2.6709,5.7141,0.4745,0.6582,1.6123,2.6165,2.8954,5.5543,0.2009,5.4639,1.555,4.3614,0.892,0.002,5.7255,2.7408,1.4757,0.893,2.622,2.091,6.9183,1.125,4.684,6.738,3.3011,4.1454,2.323,0.3908,1.0828,2.3157,4.0783,1.8568,1.0426,0.001,0.1589,3.7537,0.344,4.6094,3.3509,0.0099,0.8518,0.9434,3.284,2.8045,2.3249,1.4943,6.854,1.8595,2.5703,0.3722,3.5022,1.3034,3.2535,4.7517,0.6824,0.6672,6.2158,3.2386,0.683,0.0671,2.8116,0.4479,0.0883,0.0076,6.0741,1.3633,1.6509,1.8155,0.0587,0.0205,2.7704,0.5363,5.4328,5.0041,2.6499,3.1993,3.751,1.9581,1.3746,0.0004,4.2162,0.1391,7.6164,0.1542,7.1876,4.9573,5.6688,1.0213,3.1499,4.7204,2.4658,7.021,2.0648,2.5196,1.2428,3.663,0.204,2.2516,2.5601,0.7758,0.4246,1.732,1.5028,0.042,3.3449,1.076,3.1635,1.9051,0.9947,0.0198,1.1179,0.1074,1.6888,0.4896,3.9227,2.907,1.4173,0.3787,2.6203,5.6958,0.4524,0.0348,2.1319,4.6257,4.4046,1.1685,5.4776,3.7572,1.2037,1.6448,4.3754,1.5366,6.1607,0.4481,3.8246,0.2799,3.2288,3.424,1.7815,2.3734,2.2812,2.0612,1.8226,0.3785,2.9422,3.0098,2.2797,2.6181,1.0168,1.8674,1.7316,0.3237,4.4313,0.2774,2.5102,3.457,0.5233,1.9492,0.4346,5.9928,2.1586,0.4007,3.4342,0.2372,0.9845,4.5352,0.4852,1.3991,1.5724,4.9764,1.0116,3.5954,0.2797,4.0183,5.7143,3.4516,0.6531,1.4693,1.3939,2.1339,0.6194,1.7263,0.0002,3.2374,4.3445,0.9806,0.4342,1.0792,6.313,4.8881,0.897,5.1634,0.0047,5.8925,0.1605,0.3101,4.6823,1.3978,1.1785,6.0003,0.5782,4.0151,3.7336,3.442,1.085,5.5594,1.0814,0.8757,0.144,4.6029,0.2242,2.0406,0.3063,0.7788,4.6041,0.5703,3.4481,4.5057,2.9724,3.6005,0.1202,4.3437,1.549,1.4532,1.3295,1.763,2.9635,3.9895,3.9765,2.1392,0.7819,3.1054,0.844,1.0672,3.5293,1.3089,2.4505,0.3339,2.6347,1.53,0.4082,4.1412,5.1825,3.5314,4.8851,0.6026,5.2147,2.0724,0.005,1.2657,2.4116,1.1229,5.3026,0.9729,0.9512,2.0034,3.4375,0.1102,2.3782,0.6197,1.2549,3.1778,0.3384,1.7882,3.067,5.0996,3.3313,0.8384,5.2309,0.4037,0.9529,1.7979,6.5636,2.6028,2.9347,2.4502,0.2569,3.1204,3.8808,1.1791,5.2074,1.112,0.92,0.0002,4.0759,3.0661,1.3471,0.0686,0.5712,0.5189,2.5695,1.6829,0.0963,0.1052,5.698,0.2555,0.0557,0.0014,3.1456]}

That was the beginning of the end in the Prison System as far as America's eyes were concerned. During the first prison riots, some 5,000 inmates and 3,000 guards were killed in America.\n\nThe first prisoner riots took place in the American prison system in the mid-1960s after being imprisoned for nonviolent crimes. When the first one occurred, the US Federal Bureau of Prisons were sent to investigate and to try to find ways of stopping riots from happening again. In 1965, the Bureau asked Congress to provide more money to the Bureau to conduct tests to find ways of stopping the next riot. In 1966, the Office of Prison Health and Human Services was created. In 1968, the Bureau of Prisons created the Bureau of Prisons Inspectors.\n\nLater in 2014, a new report found that the US Federal Prison System is overcrowded to such an extent that some prisoners are having to sleep on the floor. Prison officers report that there were 6,000 prisoners being housed in a one-bed cell, and 5,000 prisoners in a double-cell cell.\n\nIn 2013, approximately 34,000 Americans were in jail and prison prisons.

Mr. Anderson then joins forces with The Warrior and Dr. Lasky in an attempt to defeat The Z'ha'dum.\n\nMr. Anderson is a robot warrior, fighting for a world of evil and the death of all life. His main weapon is a giant flamethrower and he is able to fire it from a variety of arm-styles such as the giant fist, the axe, the mace, the rocket launcher, and the giant bat. At the beginning of the game, this weapon is simply used to shoot the invading aliens but soon it begins to develop a personality, even more then Mr. Anderson. Mr. Anderson can even learn how to say human names, and even use language in unique ways.\n\nFeatures:","token_len":343,"entropy":[1.2507,2.0652,0.0593,3.496,8.1359,7.8545,0.7768,5.3448,7.5584,0.029,4.5137,0.6142,4.6753,1.8073,7.9769,4.4828,4.6521,4.2837,0.8924,0.7342,9.3586,3.3566,3.612,2.5028,4.3748,10.2064,2.0275,2.2002,3.0337,0.0081,0.003,0.0009,0.298,0.748,0.0055,3.6544,4.9955,1.3519,3.7252,1.6787,5.5132,4.4853,2.4924,2.2314,0.2598,1.4989,1.0742,1.1003,0.0031,0.4171,3.7794,5.9472,1.2286,0.862,3.5735,2.697,2.3686,0.3405,3.1033,3.7889,0.0845,5.7877,2.2738,1.9459,1.2672,0.0433,0.3392,4.0072,4.1123,1.6518,0.1906,0.1005,1.2446,2.7394,5.2206,1.7725,2.821,0.7934,1.9006,0.5379,0.2281,0.0021,0.0393,1.9023,0.1551,3.9561,0.7102,0.7006,2.8608,1.0698,1.8052,4.9887,3.3498,5.2155,1.9751,0.0092,0.0189,5.2741,0.7562,3.7544,5.3458,0.18,1.3224,3.8016,3.5958,2.4765,4.0457,2.33,3.5033,5.6303,1.072,0.4613,4.0887,2.0945,2.6213,0.7516,0.0058,0.0023,0.089,1.5784,0.0342,5.0021,2.1866,0.4919,0.0076,2.5346,4.5968,4.8585,1.8023,1.5429,0.0234,5.2007,4.091,0.017,1.29,3.7786,4.4242,1.233,0.9737,0.1338,1.3685,0.0254,2.5793,5.3236,1.7207,0.4723,1.0388,0.0027,0.0026,0.0001,0.0008,1.657,4.6557,0.2408,1.3023,3.3156,0.5767,0.9289,1.6301,0.1933,5.2217,4.8215,3.3075,5.7849,0.0013,0.0011,0.0708,2.3854,0.1675,1.5506,4.0456,6.0339,0.5465,2.1481,5.4172,0.0157,0.001,0.1175,0.2957,5.8591,0.0071,5.0861,4.5195,5.5448,1.7662,0.0023,0.2856,3.5878,0.8361,3.7942,0.0022,0.0025,2.0627,3.7301,1.9031,0.0076,0.3363,0.0101,1.469,2.7941,0.0031,0.0048,0.0002,0.0006,2.4236,1.4555,0.7474,0.005,2.1009,1.75,0.4358,0.004,0.021,0.007,0.0038,0.7723,0.8692,0.0003,4.4907,0.0046,0.0149,1.5163,1.2129,2.159,5.8908,1.9801,6.3184,1.1991,3.1713,3.4366,2.5391,4.5477,2.5583,3.7798,4.5088,0.0462,1.4598,2.1571,0.301,3.0574,4.3043,0.5573,0.1683,1.0567,3.3609,5.1564,0.22,0.0002,0.0218,3.5871,1.4109,1.6162,2.7662,0.004,3.007,1.097,1.9918,1.7712,2.3,0.0027,3.833,1.9893,6.7286,4.2104,0.0086,1.9588,4.7115,4.3447,0.7119,1.119,4.3534,0.3747,0.9959,3.5023,0.0597,0.3142,1.1015,4.4033,0.1954,0.4155,0.5526,0.4724,4.2685,4.9433,0.3996,5.7488,0.6279,1.3148,0.0789,0.1771,0.9097,0.1986,4.7872,3.536,0.6104,5.5575,2.7137,0.7482,4.8844,2.5793,5.8229,1.7117,3.8339,3.1208,2.183,4.5873,0.0833,3.7556,1.5519,0.8702,2.3378,4.8674,5.062,6.0614,1.7376,0.0036,0.0163,1.4534,2.6977,0.0042,0.007,2.8535,4.1719,3.9949,2.8211,0.0145,6.0803,4.5674,3.9927,1.6335,2.3494,2.6917,4.1778,5.3422,2.4661,6.5383,0.0857,0.5208,1.0298,0.0002,5.8326,0.7835]}

In the case of Alzheimer's, the answer may be that in the time it takes for your mind to think that you're writing a letter to yourself right now, it's been forgotten. The letters to yourself go away, and the predictions he makes are wrong.\n\nThe same could be said for the patient's brain after being struck by Parkinson's. When the patient is struck with the disease, he thinks that he's talking to himself, but the brain is completely oblivious to what's happening to it:\n\nThe patient's thoughts \"talk\" to him while they are present in his consciousness, but when he's stricken with Parkinson's, his thoughts \"talk\" to him but are not present. As far as the patient's neurology is concerned, it's just a normal conversation that goes on all the time in the context of the brain's normal functioning.\n\nIf there's no awareness in a patient who is aware, what can be said about when consciousness becomes conscious? I'm not sure where this might lead, but some research has revealed that the conscious brain is still able to make predictions, although the results may be incorrect. The patient was able to answer questions designed to elicit thoughts from his brain and predictions about how he would answer. They could be correct as they had never thought about that before. What the patients are doing will only become apparent when they are conscious again.\n\nMore from Smithsonian.com:\n\nNeuroscientists on the Science of Pain and the Mind","token_len":344,"entropy":[5.7994,3.9123,7.4401,0.0078,9.4319,3.7718,0.5185,3.6793,2.2994,7.4456,0.317,0.0681,4.5115,5.6001,1.0891,3.4969,1.7966,1.4516,5.7478,4.1587,3.468,2.4586,5.6895,0.8493,0.0007,3.6683,0.5778,3.9235,5.1846,4.1588,3.6314,0.9441,1.0125,1.6804,1.8662,3.4039,0.4152,1.9356,0.6007,3.7737,1.918,2.821,0.0079,4.4085,0.0073,0.3356,1.462,1.9634,2.6509,0.497,2.1474,5.8683,0.9991,5.9408,2.2872,0.163,0.9897,4.1679,2.6204,0.0202,3.8655,3.5004,1.1183,0.8573,1.5252,1.7693,0.0512,0.6904,0.1032,6.2842,0.0315,0.0977,2.501,0.8643,3.072,5.1488,0.7324,3.278,1.8138,4.9234,0.4009,6.3069,4.6995,1.352,0.9654,1.4841,3.0204,5.7699,0.3408,1.8388,2.2769,0.2961,0.9355,0.0014,2.5627,3.4355,3.7969,0.4251,0.7677,0.9354,1.6919,6.027,1.5562,3.3198,5.4378,4.0106,4.2064,0.5601,5.6299,0.0051,1.6595,2.9098,1.3675,1.0034,1.4266,2.0661,1.7642,3.0614,0.2475,0.1078,3.2543,3.9231,1.3869,0.493,0.4331,4.4713,0.1288,0.2177,1.1111,1.3887,1.5972,1.1947,1.3182,4.8426,2.7176,0.4816,1.4962,1.4548,0.9726,2.6682,0.8178,5.5064,1.8847,0.0003,2.2161,1.4201,1.672,3.2142,6.1877,3.4245,0.2377,0.1852,1.0251,5.1118,2.8351,0.7799,4.2981,1.6899,0.3657,3.9277,0.8554,0.641,2.1988,2.2192,2.623,3.75,0.4625,0.3559,0.0472,0.4999,1.8919,0.865,1.6356,0.4605,0.0085,0.1962,0.5092,2.0035,2.2781,1.5393,1.064,1.7885,4.136,4.2961,0.0094,0.3917,0.6391,2.6074,4.7427,0.9669,0.166,0.0036,0.0226,2.771,0.5358,2.0006,1.1762,3.302,2.0514,3.6014,4.0014,0.1954,2.4454,0.1618,0.0064,2.9076,1.5719,5.7194,0.0106,1.6094,3.0939,0.5007,0.5144,1.1429,0.1605,0.5672,0.0002,4.1556,4.248,0.6789,2.1729,4.6308,2.8526,3.1242,0.8724,4.3333,1.4415,4.887,0.8823,2.6511,2.5455,2.3264,1.4055,0.4418,5.3485,1.9011,3.0871,2.599,0.1681,4.3182,2.3056,0.9762,0.9841,5.8542,1.9993,5.6127,1.0952,0.5713,0.1236,5.314,4.0142,1.9137,5.403,0.381,2.1707,4.6678,2.4865,1.19,4.7629,3.047,0.0048,2.2258,1.103,2.0653,4.0777,2.1746,3.8811,2.0872,0.939,3.8038,0.3984,3.0057,2.0163,3.8595,2.4481,0.0036,5.3404,0.8089,6.6254,0.042,4.122,4.6069,1.8703,1.4045,1.0813,3.4399,5.2746,0.9734,2.758,1.7137,0.4429,0.6251,1.199,5.2478,4.3903,3.0794,2.0678,5.2068,3.7902,3.8333,3.7075,4.1748,0.6701,3.8215,1.6782,0.8125,5.1185,3.4509,2.7869,4.037,2.1322,7.5625,4.5452,0.4728,1.6415,0.8683,0.7525,1.3915,2.2873,1.9172,0.4186,0.3237,0.0002,5.6754,2.5924,0.242,0.0086,0.0001,0.0334,0.0249,0.0002,4.8429,0.2457,0.9168,0.4347,5.3993,1.2025,5.7365,0.1573,5.5222,3.2522,2.0065,3.6101]}

At this place, even if the battle continued, he thought that he might even die, this level of danger was something he could never have imagined.\n\n[Previous Chapter] [Table of Contents] [Next Chapter]\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":346,"entropy":[4.1859,3.481,8.1303,1.4718,5.4541,1.5316,2.4203,0.0016,2.4754,2.328,3.3961,2.2308,7.5026,10.8013,3.5132,0.0166,1.2222,7.2088,2.1542,6.757,0.0016,1.9838,1.9159,5.7835,1.1491,0.0501,1.1063,2.7547,2.5669,4.2992,6.2568,4.2463,7.9561,3.1028,2.8159,1.1083,3.5156,4.8039,4.4179,2.5946,0.7549,0.3068,6.0721,4.6698,0.3775,1.6149,1.8466,3.4261,2.6,3.3963,0.1304,0.8816,1.3347,0.0002,1.2962,2.5875,4.2616,2.1361,1.4451,2.2301,1.3918,0.407,1.3978,4.4763,1.7322,3.8026,2.051,7.5321,3.5593,0.8843,1.8962,0.496,0.0075,4.1841,0.0928,0.0856,5.9845,0.2111,0.6326,1.0037,0.0002,2.8595,3.1655,2.2248,2.8409,0.5316,0.0746,5.9454,0.0005,5.1837,1.5042,2.0975,2.5097,6.0672,3.1444,0.3012,0.6882,5.8919,5.2153,3.5032,4.8244,5.2655,0.0834,2.3377,2.5341,0.5631,0.9377,0.0002,3.0973,0.861,5.5331,1.8676,0.5848,3.8724,0.4017,0.0319,2.3926,4.702,3.4155,0.0696,1.2037,5.2202,0.7479,0.7568,0.0002,2.8229,0.0043,0.0029,1.0573,3.3413,2.0713,0.3524,0.8865,1.6486,1.9591,1.5525,0.5193,0.0096,2.6025,4.7073,2.068,0.9287,0.3371,0.4645,0.4127,0.0002,5.0485,5.6996,4.2218,1.7489,3.5282,3.1046,2.2832,0.3446,0.5314,3.5846,5.7011,1.1062,0.3968,1.2854,1.0332,1.0285,3.272,2.5734,0.1284,1.9012,3.9994,3.8593,6.3638,2.293,0.0024,1.4241,0.606,0.7931,6.4761,1.9156,2.3195,2.6397,3.5678,4.5682,3.2427,5.0284,3.7492,2.6671,3.1936,1.167,3.7458,0.0064,0.6968,5.2052,4.7665,0.0034,1.3085,0.0024,0.2533,0.011,0.0255,3.3597,3.0539,4.1408,2.2445,4.0244,2.8925,0.913,2.6844,6.5938,2.5806,0.029,3.059,0.8896,0.1193,0.294,0.2215,0.0003,4.7628,5.6284,1.9831,3.993,2.5578,1.1076,2.1409,0.1911,2.9612,3.3213,4.5117,4.365,0.2043,4.1956,0.3139,2.6116,1.6985,5.2354,3.3852,1.089,0.6458,0.8836,0.7413,0.211,0.7252,0.0002,4.8758,4.8527,0.809,0.0085,3.7247,3.3754,2.0542,0.9257,1.6313,1.3655,4.0746,5.241,1.5315,0.9813,0.6596,0.0035,0.4361,0.5783,3.9442,1.4313,2.6991,3.3069,2.3676,3.7006,0.0972,0.0002,3.8539,1.9055,5.4045,3.158,0.3585,1.8658,0.403,3.397,3.1314,1.4775,2.2779,0.5683,0.0285,4.1317,0.0657,0.8456,3.0585,2.9699,1.0252,4.8483,1.7196,1.5573,0.0442,2.2197,4.8192,0.0075,1.8999,4.3089,5.2565,3.4143,1.0578,5.1228,1.3547,7.4198,0.2976,4.2088,1.1411,3.344,4.3826,3.6257,1.286,0.6995,6.9531,0.7956,0.6448,3.6454,3.993,1.9566,3.2737,5.5763,5.5801,0.0241,2.4889,0.7763,1.6959,1.0204,2.3872,1.723,1.3628,0.3534,0.5429,0.0806,0.0003,5.0274,0.0046,0.0064,0.0173,0.0002,0.0011,0.0005,0.0029,0.0001,0.0001,0.0001,0.0146,0.0002,0.015,0.0004,0.0018]}

{"id":671,"ended":true,"length":346,"gen_text":"After a man wrongfully spends 25 years in literal hell, he sees something he has never seen before. A door marked `` Exit '' opens and God says that in the year 2012 he will grant him the power to turn his own sins into perfect joy. God then reveals to him that the way to paradise is in the next room. With no choice but to follow the Lord, God takes Peter and the Lord's disciples to the next room. There God will give them the ability to forgive others and to free them from all their sins. The Lord promises to wipe away all the debt we owe to those who have harmed us, including every pew and seat on every church pulpit and in every meeting. If we follow this counsel, we will go to heaven regardless of how many people God may have been trying to kill in the past. If we live our lives as God wants them to be lived, we will be given the grace to forgive and be forgiven. It will never again be a problem for us to say who did wrong so we can get the money. We will live in paradise alone while everyone else is drowning and on the way out. Peter says that God tells him that if he can be his own best friend to Jesus Christ, then Jesus will grant him the power to be forgiven. It is also explained that God will change people so that they will love one another, and that we will receive the gift of God's mercy, the power to save others and to forgive others.

Her breathing is the very foundation of how she runs, and as a yogi, she can continue to breathe in harmony with this amazing thing that she is.\n\nWatch her explain in this video:","token_len":356,"entropy":[3.305,2.3842,10.0994,1.8706,2.8458,2.1883,3.7806,0.6438,1.8289,0.3001,0.9912,5.8229,2.9733,2.0557,2.6235,2.2842,3.2523,5.9704,0.0005,2.5899,2.9698,3.2487,1.912,1.579,2.4624,1.9271,1.3068,1.1242,3.4912,0.0003,5.2915,0.4545,6.1605,6.455,2.0474,1.7095,0.4359,5.941,0.3485,2.7479,2.4068,0.6344,0.6135,0.2786,0.6197,0.0379,1.8849,1.7569,1.0493,0.8741,1.8963,1.1428,0.3472,0.003,4.7012,1.9018,3.1062,0.3094,4.0185,5.5673,2.2774,2.8672,0.0003,0.3479,0.0847,1.5307,4.0008,1.6293,4.875,0.9032,1.3291,0.0002,0.2564,3.6544,0.5854,1.6153,2.4458,2.5319,4.0711,0.0003,1.235,2.679,5.2693,3.605,3.3547,0.339,0.1409,5.4515,0.2364,3.1614,0.8235,1.3235,0.3693,0.0354,4.9001,4.8015,0.0185,0.824,1.5089,1.4234,5.3234,1.3312,1.2164,1.6265,0.027,3.137,3.8762,4.9108,0.8704,3.9189,2.1506,1.0676,3.2096,2.0125,3.0008,0.0002,2.4902,3.1227,0.3146,0.0002,3.9866,2.7249,0.7839,0.091,0.0555,0.0096,0.001,0.0025,0.0023,0.0013,1.9882,0.0976,0.0446,0.0194,0.022,0.0054,5.5803,0.4443,0.0361,0.0036,0.002,0.0017,0.0302,0.0123,0.0095,0.0055,0.0013,0.0075,0.002,0.0035,0.003,0.0036,0.0117,0.0012,0.0435,0.0032,0.0026,0.0013,0.002,0.0018,0.0022,0.2087,0.6341,0.0002,4.1073,1.1687,1.6869,5.2957,0.9719,5.881,6.5473,5.2298,4.5868,3.1493,2.8243,0.4105,1.4037,2.2313,0.6224,0.6823,0.5127,5.0184,3.1608,2.9273,1.3178,2.6198,2.4793,0.9383,2.8355,2.864,3.5398,0.9128,0.401,5.4348,1.5213,4.0946,1.1192,1.1565,0.0003,0.6968,0.0847,2.7068,1.0941,0.5454,0.0002,1.4751,1.1888,5.0637,0.0002,1.1197,4.3757,0.3722,0.8358,0.6233,1.2904,2.4595,5.1138,1.5791,1.6691,0.4014,0.501,0.218,0.2409,0.7267,2.471,0.4829,1.9311,0.7772,0.017,3.5766,3.7416,1.6788,4.4915,0.4276,3.3353,1.4495,3.5423,3.6119,0.2971,2.1833,0.0888,0.0002,4.9919,3.3169,0.8018,1.9136,3.2039,0.1915,0.875,4.6074,1.0666,1.0131,4.9148,7.1581,5.549,0.4756,2.4768,2.3286,0.7754,0.0002,0.4357,0.9148,4.1809,2.6428,3.2312,0.0358,3.3723,3.0767,1.7714,3.8504,5.3941,4.8618,1.3521,1.9881,1.4458,4.5732,0.1192,4.7784,2.1025,5.5432,1.3114,0.3088,1.1504,3.5562,1.9171,0.9924,3.1434,6.0538,4.5965,0.1499,0.2663,0.4561,2.9979,3.0756,0.7733,6.4318,0.4462,0.1312,0.4571,0.2191,2.3813,2.2106,0.937,0.0539,0.0002,4.4282,5.0201,1.5217,0.1826,1.907,5.0888,1.8663,3.3701,0.3445,4.7623,3.4838,1.2774,4.0661,5.8738,3.2295,0.1051,3.8265,0.1205,4.0642,3.1717,1.6066,4.7399,2.083,4.6135,0.0788,0.2983,0.4508,3.1641,5.5082,0.2586,1.2914,3.0418,6.1198,0.2934,5.0663,4.1453,3.5692,1.5565,0.8838,3.2219,0.3491,0.5011,0.0002,4.5075,2.8172,3.8619,3.3244,1.3329,0.9512,0.5908]}

In this exclusive excerpt from the series, the marauder discovers that a secret group of supervillains has teamed up with an ordinary police officer to use Gotham City's many superpowered individuals against each other. As part of his research, however, the marauder discovers that one of his targets has the ability to control a city's police force, while another has the ability to control a superhero's powers\u2014and a third, with enough money, can make his own team members use their powers for personal gain\u2014all while leaving one of his victims, a homeless man named Jimmy, in the dangerous hands of the city's superpowered criminal underworld.\n\nBut the story takes a bit of a trip into the surreal when the marauder begins to suspect that the police officer that's working with the supervillain group might actually be the superhero himself. \"The Outsiders\" is published under the imprint Comic Book Men, and, as a bonus, a bunch of original art from the series is up for grabs.

{"id":1501,"ended":true,"length":337,"gen_text":"In an awkward moment, you catch Satan burying fossils.\n\nIn one of the most heartbreaking moments of the first season, Satan visits Noah's dream in which Noah is trapped in a burning pit and is threatened by a swarm of giant spiders. As he's about to drown, Satan reminds Noah that God has saved him once \u2014 and he is sure that God will save him again.\n\nOne moment in \"A Lot Like Us\" that got people talking, though, was when Jesus, Mary Magdalene and the two evangelists return to earth to preach. The apostles are walking on the beach looking for Jesus, but find a large, menacing, flying creature, which looks like a dinosaur. The angel appears, warning Satan to stay away from Jesus and calling her friends to him.\n\nOne moment that people were really buzzing about, though, is the climax of the episode, where there's a full-blown battle between Satan and Jesus, where Satan gets the better of his enemy and makes him disappear. The sequence was also accompanied by a song about the battle, in which David gets to sing \"Satan\" and perform some sort of dance.\n\n\"A Lot Like Us\" was also the first episode of the season (tentatively titled \"#Ain't It a Pity\" on the show ) without any music at all.

The victim had been shot in the head approximately 20 feet from where her car was parked. The female has no significant injuries. The preliminary investigation has linked this incident with two other incidents in which four pedestrians were shot and killed on NE 85 between Division and SE 72nd Avenue, with one of the fatalities occurring in an area where this pedestrian had reportedly been seen earlier in the evening. Following a report that five other subjects observed earlier this evening had also been shot, detectives began to investigate. Evidence collected and interview with witnesses will be developed, and there is a high probability that the five individuals who have been identified will ultimately be identified as the shooter in all three shooting incidents.\n\nInvestigating Agency(s)\n\nAgency Name: Portland Police Bureau\n\nAgency Contact Person: Detective Daniel Johnson (503) 823-3862\n\nAgency Phone Number: 503-823-0333\n\nAgency E-Mail: [email protected]\n\nAgency Case Number: 105-121229\n\n\nNCIC Case Number: Unknown\n\nNamUs Case Number: 58414\n\nInformation Source(s)\n\nNamUs\n\nNearest City: Beaverton\n\nNearest State\/Province: Oregon\n\nInformation Source(s)\n\nKGW\n\nOregon State Police\n\nKGW News 8\n\nAdmin Notes\n\nAdded: Prior to 2004; Last Updated: 1\/11\/18","token_len":362,"entropy":[8.59,8.8623,1.6993,0.0022,5.5741,4.2214,1.844,2.844,3.6368,5.6247,2.7603,6.0354,0.3308,1.3528,0.5432,0.0002,4.8392,3.2109,0.2583,4.0927,5.0318,4.9687,0.3268,3.1392,3.1861,6.1271,0.3105,0.0002,5.409,3.6254,3.5653,0.8332,1.7298,3.8904,0.0264,2.4148,1.6437,0.358,4.8734,1.4406,0.6418,5.4361,1.5795,1.7585,0.0017,1.6866,2.4688,3.6435,0.2081,0.0037,0.1231,3.7876,6.0572,0.8551,4.0817,1.0848,0.3375,1.4006,3.8879,5.5161,1.402,5.6989,0.2044,1.1964,1.0492,2.5364,0.9308,2.0041,0.7409,0.0582,1.4122,5.7192,2.9411,1.1463,0.5547,3.3509,2.096,1.1579,0.8011,0.3994,0.2699,1.3012,4.0595,3.0593,5.2286,5.2581,0.8045,0.7472,1.5137,6.2072,0.1209,2.6573,6.5829,1.7752,0.8125,3.3697,3.1848,0.8431,2.4934,1.5828,0.7406,4.798,5.4831,0.7268,0.5561,2.5545,0.5667,2.8787,4.0334,5.3164,5.9312,4.1821,0.2997,4.4779,5.2839,0.0104,1.7684,3.0239,4.5064,1.9712,0.913,0.7598,4.7288,1.1796,1.4825,3.9519,1.8312,2.0158,3.0928,4.7724,1.7439,6.0324,0.4892,3.0403,1.3007,1.4337,0.0146,0.8722,0.207,6.5246,3.1394,5.2063,2.2115,6.3743,3.4889,5.6913,7.0335,3.9375,4.7719,0.1184,1.9817,2.1955,0.086,0.313,0.8668,3.0179,4.2522,1.5216,1.2746,2.5704,5.8111,1.7306,4.5799,4.806,1.837,1.0315,3.2078,0.8693,4.9565,4.3639,1.0549,5.722,1.041,0.9913,3.4332,0.9583,0.2044,2.9481,3.9489,1.9321,2.586,2.4955,0.145,1.261,1.5697,6.8285,0.0842,1.2113,0.6383,1.3017,3.0672,2.8387,2.8071,1.1485,3.437,0.1956,0.1009,1.1243,0.0003,4.0986,1.2986,0.564,0.3403,0.0003,0.0124,0.0009,0.0003,0.0024,0.0018,0.0003,0.0021,0.4442,0.0306,0.0526,0.0343,0.0003,0.0029,0.0,0.0017,0.0003,0.0025,0.0898,4.9416,4.588,2.9999,0.2215,0.0576,0.333,0.0077,0.0091,2.9033,4.3136,0.2619,0.0004,0.0019,0.0,0.0032,0.0006,0.0004,0.2491,0.1562,0.0122,0.0002,0.0023,2.0827,4.793,0.2296,0.0003,0.0151,0.0,0.0009,0.0003,0.0008,0.0014,1.0252,0.0008,0.0006,0.0019,0.0313,0.0003,0.0142,0.0,0.0001,0.0008,0.0007,4.7938,1.8403,3.2906,4.8871,4.759,4.2535,0.0004,0.0302,0.0035,0.0003,0.0005,0.0005,1.8699,0.0267,0.0003,0.0314,0.0034,0.0001,0.0004,0.0021,0.0004,3.1122,5.5065,4.3429,0.2314,0.0003,0.122,0.0001,0.0,0.0005,0.0003,0.0013,0.0002,0.0264,0.1121,0.0,0.0331,0.0003,5.2149,2.2343,1.0323,0.008,3.9324,0.0001,0.2592,0.0002,1.314,0.0,0.1992,3.0658,0.151,0.0004,0.0016,0.5452,0.0232,0.0002,0.4862,0.0032,0.0003,0.0001,0.0001,0.0019,0.0002,5.6763,0.3641,0.8325,0.0002,2.2137,1.8544,0.4308,0.1556,0.0002,4.3433,1.4136,1.5768,3.5042,0.3025,0.0002,0.8406,0.0075,0.0024,0.0002,0.0001,0.0005,0.1821,0.0018,3.8714,0.002,0.0006,0.001,0.0003,2.2493,0.0016,3.4091,0.0018,0.6616]}

I can NEVER talk to you!\"\n\nThen, some day, I decided it would be funny to find a problem and solve it, so I called up some of my closest friends and asked them what they did when they were mean to me and they all said, \"Well, I just laughed like crazy!\" Which really meant that they did not want to be mean to me because the answer to one of the questions, \"how do you stop being mean,\" was so obvious: I went out and had a really good time doing the things I wanted to do.\n\nEven though there is always a chance that someone you do not like can talk to you, it helps you to ask yourself, \"what are the chances?\" Do your best to go to the dark side, if necessary, just in case.\n\n* This list was originally created in 2007 and has since been edited and cleaned up quite a bit.","token_len":363,"entropy":[6.0517,1.6783,2.3581,10.0604,0.202,3.4843,4.4505,1.4871,6.2995,4.3633,6.0321,4.0959,0.0764,1.6161,0.586,4.2221,3.6855,0.0274,1.2915,4.4663,2.2333,1.181,1.8815,3.75,3.6497,5.5918,2.53,4.5497,0.8986,0.024,0.0631,2.0966,0.0337,0.006,0.0022,4.6262,1.1144,0.018,5.3577,2.8496,3.9035,2.2233,2.8319,0.858,8.5425,0.3753,2.3415,3.6214,4.9692,0.6371,2.2467,0.1567,0.0052,1.711,1.6413,1.3254,5.4731,0.3498,0.3428,2.179,1.7789,0.808,2.6405,0.8265,4.8721,3.3092,0.8551,0.1313,2.0063,0.5861,0.0001,3.5641,1.0249,3.5711,0.2398,5.2477,5.1017,1.4432,0.5834,4.1123,3.6365,1.3458,1.6352,0.4365,2.1518,4.8057,4.3577,3.9191,6.163,2.3254,5.2636,2.6063,5.999,0.3086,3.3237,0.434,0.0028,1.027,6.9687,0.7913,4.795,0.9112,0.6732,1.7932,0.1836,0.0002,4.5982,2.2761,1.1109,2.0369,5.1937,0.0045,0.0283,0.4776,0.8531,1.9374,0.5629,5.5035,1.9214,5.6741,1.2995,3.9516,1.7167,5.1133,2.7984,1.6427,0.6686,0.0613,0.0899,1.3606,4.8639,2.0152,3.7692,1.5765,0.0029,4.4303,0.1892,0.04,6.4454,0.5294,0.684,1.8444,4.3303,3.281,3.1181,5.1272,3.0329,0.4254,0.6873,0.0313,0.5378,2.9621,0.0315,3.7075,0.4704,0.5931,6.0127,0.7673,3.5106,2.1368,2.3319,0.3092,1.9135,0.7915,3.3098,4.3167,0.2949,0.091,4.8475,0.5311,0.259,1.8668,0.4632,0.9911,2.7984,1.9177,1.6496,1.7792,8.8545,0.108,0.0114,0.0295,1.0194,1.3222,0.0002,3.2648,2.0024,5.4925,4.366,0.3123,0.8865,3.1822,3.3182,0.6087,0.0305,2.1359,0.2346,5.6172,1.7248,6.0977,2.5933,2.7141,0.0377,3.0944,0.8597,0.099,3.729,1.6332,3.4828,1.7263,0.1766,3.7858,0.1795,0.696,1.6171,0.2697,2.1813,0.987,2.4302,1.1653,0.6065,0.6078,0.1316,0.0466,0.2602,3.1472,0.802,1.2457,0.5487,1.0188,0.0801,2.4554,0.1183,1.1088,2.3199,4.5379,5.2792,1.1432,1.529,4.9074,4.6738,4.169,1.2999,0.6184,3.8107,1.1801,2.4999,0.0364,2.8195,0.0864,0.1227,0.0113,3.2416,4.7373,3.296,0.7452,6.0411,0.1996,0.9427,1.4779,4.7288,0.4654,4.2705,1.2784,0.1492,4.2008,0.6603,0.1236,3.2559,0.3197,5.0734,1.0677,3.8533,2.9913,6.2636,2.4121,0.8593,3.3825,0.9266,2.6901,0.6157,0.1904,3.4994,3.8278,1.5198,0.7559,0.9955,0.0349,0.0423,1.1263,0.6004,0.0002,5.7748,0.9871,4.2585,1.693,4.0771,1.0553,3.2153,0.497,2.5523,3.1318,4.7796,0.2539,0.9635,3.7078,3.9847,0.5905,0.0425,1.4144,1.9384,5.2216,3.8414,0.6051,5.4726,0.775,1.2484,0.1807,3.162,2.7953,0.9189,2.0028,3.4842,4.5243,4.4609,0.7147,0.194,5.2681,2.1464,1.2844,4.4444,0.3635,2.0505,3.3942,5.7644,0.9263,3.9048,1.7956,0.0471,0.9338,0.6646,0.0002,5.4559,4.2929,4.8203,1.6764,1.8899,2.7373,2.074,3.1265,1.4035,1.4601,1.5875,0.2803,4.6907,1.3709,7.3808,0.0345,4.8119,0.0126,0.1495,0.2134]}

Time has run its course, and our world is nothing more than an empty shell.\n\n\nBut it's not over yet: the threat of the Dead is not yet over, and the War continues.\n\n\nFenimore has survived and the Great War is finally over.

What will he make of his memories during the Great War?\n\n\nIf there's not a third installment set in this universe, I can't help but think that there might be a fourth, where the events of one of the novels occur: The War will still be here, only now there will be five people, and their world is already far different than what they knew.\n\n\nSo we get a series that is set in two time periods instead of one. What would this series be called? Would it be called The War for Fenimore, and he is in the middle of that book, and he has no memories of the War? He will die during The War. Would this be The War of Fenimore?\n\n\nWould the War not exist if Fenimore simply gave up his immortality and died, then took up another job before he died?","token_len":367,"entropy":[11.799,2.3137,3.1457,1.4484,6.9282,0.9657,8.3763,0.778,0.001,5.5027,4.4403,5.238,0.0007,3.1716,0.6408,1.1405,1.0732,3.1831,0.2922,0.0003,4.4798,0.1221,0.023,1.2476,0.1033,1.0205,4.5358,4.7991,5.9386,4.5317,0.119,0.0102,0.0006,2.4067,0.0002,2.7793,5.3371,2.2357,2.9781,2.0059,1.1808,1.0327,1.1359,5.0473,1.2444,1.055,3.2157,0.2681,2.7449,0.3295,1.9177,4.5345,3.5621,0.5357,0.607,1.1756,6.3625,1.6093,3.1949,0.3501,5.2762,1.5938,3.8329,0.2064,0.0134,0.8823,0.1599,4.5419,1.4307,0.6437,5.1185,0.573,0.0254,2.6617,2.166,0.3186,1.0626,2.1981,0.0002,1.7847,3.6505,1.5183,0.3639,0.6818,0.6411,5.1236,1.443,5.75,0.3161,0.9022,5.3366,1.3601,2.0751,0.849,0.7771,1.3968,0.1904,1.1621,3.1635,3.4655,0.7561,0.8607,0.0002,5.5468,5.3481,4.5539,3.3261,4.5557,3.4811,3.778,3.391,0.0303,0.4048,3.5324,0.1186,0.412,4.9291,4.3652,0.7021,4.1536,2.6728,5.1811,1.7377,4.9608,6.3214,1.1724,1.065,1.4023,4.435,2.6182,1.3388,2.5166,0.8418,0.6686,3.1316,0.3994,4.9998,3.5935,5.8001,1.3355,0.0002,3.9522,4.1285,0.9835,0.6195,2.3075,4.7804,3.2451,2.5915,6.2185,3.4021,2.3988,1.3236,4.3771,3.9513,3.9997,0.4754,2.8731,4.6508,4.0905,1.7443,1.0023,2.9186,1.2286,1.2112,4.1333,1.7387,3.5411,2.1223,2.4516,0.6208,0.0002,4.5764,3.3195,4.7579,1.7214,0.0032,0.0096,1.3389,3.9771,0.1876,1.1443,3.6866,0.1172,0.7881,4.0986,3.8191,4.4556,0.6243,6.2107,0.5533,1.3853,0.3457,2.0571,0.7369,0.5495,4.6737,0.0886,1.9226,2.3413,3.5772,0.1328,3.7952,0.007,0.0774,0.9635,0.0002,4.7008,4.3111,1.5069,6.1934,1.0859,5.9197,4.3313,6.7743,0.484,1.9328,0.9039,0.351,1.2876,3.7981,0.6714,2.9047,0.2397,1.3643,0.6945,3.1903,2.8782,0.6753,1.0492,1.8588,1.9596,5.4497,1.8656,3.9364,0.2817,6.2609,1.8056,0.485,3.4683,4.5014,5.9355,2.281,1.9847,4.3526,4.2267,0.5656,4.4735,0.3996,5.1735,1.8249,3.1231,1.8574,0.0771,4.9967,3.3697,3.0334,1.4898,3.6597,3.797,1.9753,4.2482,5.1296,1.7724,1.4534,3.0354,2.7149,1.2703,1.2386,0.8337,0.0003,3.786,3.8868,3.8758,1.9451,4.6493,2.5509,1.9949,2.4002,0.7092,4.162,2.9298,0.1103,6.1299,0.0137,0.5401,1.0918,3.5091,3.667,3.1584,1.519,0.6626,2.8489,0.3489,3.8723,0.4484,0.2578,1.1574,1.058,1.1608,4.0228,2.1376,0.0022,2.3442,4.489,5.6664,1.912,3.7092,0.8679,1.897,0.1341,2.5746,4.9109,1.6063,2.0735,2.3391,2.6784,3.3902,1.936,0.3411,0.9932,1.5699,0.7893,4.9324,2.9291,5.2079,2.1096,3.2845,0.1164,2.3083,2.0738,3.9637,0.8606,1.4659,0.6191,1.5361,0.518,0.0014,1.3727,1.8829,0.0003,2.975,2.5375,1.3799,4.179,4.9806,2.1824,0.7486,0.0006,6.4061,3.7795,0.5696,1.6724,0.9702,1.4602,3.1094,2.8399,3.7535,5.4525,2.0408,2.9832,4.3893,5.6458,1.3504,0.5196,0.312]}

I tried it once with an old college roommate -- he thought it was awesome.\n\nHow did it make you feel?\n\nGreat. Great. Great. It felt so good that I couldn't believe I was doing it. I have since stopped it. It's gotten to the point where I'm taking it with a very high dose for my asthma -- it works great with an oral inhaler, which I'm going to try later on.\n\nDo you ever smoke pot in the afternoon with your kids, or with anyone else?\n\nVery occasionally, when we're taking a walk around the block. Sometimes it's just to relax -- I can't help it -- but it's so weird that I have asthma and a cough. It turns me into a completely different person. I get so much more energy.\n\nWhat about cigarettes?\n\nI smoke a lot of cigarettes.

Then we take it up a notch and turn it up to 11 with a jam session with the group's DJ, Dj Ruckus, who also recently came out of the Blue Room to debut a new mix CD.\n\nNext, our fearless leader, DJ Blaklion, drops by with another installment of his \"Blakin' Blak\" playlist.

The show tells the tale of four young ducks, who have to learn to coexist in the new world, and fight against aliens.\n\n\"For people who were raised on DuckTales, there are similarities for characters like Scrooge, Oswald, and the rest of the gang,\" said writer Lauren Faust, who's behind the series.\n\n\"But Disney XD has really thought about this new DuckTales, and it's really the opposite, it's about the kids coming to understand, and embracing, the new world.\"\n\nThere'll be new things to discover each week, including a new hero each week, said Faust.\n\nBut the show will also feature themes on family friendship, like last year's critically acclaimed Disney Channel show \"The Legend of Mickey Mouse.\" The new series will even touch on some issues like anti-LGBT rights and anti-racism.\n\n\"There's a lot of characters who are trying to find their way in a very difficult world,\" said Faust. \"We think this world is really complicated and the series is going to explore that a lot.\"\n\nThe series will premiere at 9 p.m. ET Wednesday on Disney XD, and will then be available for the rest of the week on Netflix and Disney Channel in the US.\n\nShare On Facebook Tweet Pin It Email","token_len":370,"entropy":[6.2044,7.3164,0.8214,4.7776,2.6098,1.9805,5.0445,4.5328,5.9616,0.004,6.6201,0.2295,5.6148,3.3557,0.4366,1.5361,0.295,0.3632,4.483,3.6314,0.2673,1.692,2.546,3.8245,2.1637,6.0048,2.0796,0.5534,0.0835,0.143,0.0065,0.6961,0.9471,0.0075,3.1248,1.5282,3.2117,4.1532,0.567,6.6052,0.5258,1.7581,0.0997,1.1795,2.8224,0.4452,1.9728,2.2452,1.8053,3.3582,0.0037,5.5489,0.7418,1.2912,3.2369,1.0327,1.4687,0.3969,0.3277,1.8779,5.4888,0.0001,0.9382,1.864,0.0002,1.838,2.1096,4.3496,4.1721,2.0745,2.8534,2.1342,1.8922,5.9787,4.5841,0.3197,1.049,0.3081,0.7876,0.8598,1.453,4.5584,0.1259,6.4099,1.4906,6.0553,6.4374,0.0651,1.4118,3.6348,5.5359,1.7516,0.9781,0.6977,3.0811,0.958,2.0761,0.7851,2.3696,3.802,3.9356,0.2749,2.9023,0.024,5.2344,1.7397,3.4963,1.7327,1.8606,2.6829,0.7128,1.9432,0.5251,3.0492,0.2575,2.1598,1.3248,2.0126,0.1981,1.8955,1.2685,5.3955,1.938,6.6685,2.9083,0.2745,0.0002,2.1617,4.6858,5.6888,0.3325,3.8432,2.5846,0.6347,1.9305,0.3792,0.0,0.4589,3.1527,2.1777,4.5769,5.631,6.2285,1.3504,2.1224,0.0026,0.0014,1.2478,4.0302,1.1593,1.6359,2.8831,2.1598,0.3304,0.2247,0.7116,0.6143,0.9861,5.1409,5.1742,0.2598,0.5848,0.6731,3.6512,2.9897,0.178,1.3294,0.3571,1.7454,0.0002,1.2719,1.3876,5.3507,0.8057,1.7443,3.7669,5.9943,1.0836,2.7635,2.1664,3.4212,0.4113,0.0021,1.9342,0.6773,2.4264,0.4026,1.9694,4.3618,5.8243,3.7288,2.7475,0.109,3.1752,1.7633,3.4868,2.4833,1.3768,3.9978,4.561,1.1172,3.4004,0.6376,1.2076,2.1235,0.2542,1.7587,0.0259,0.0002,4.7052,4.2484,0.1815,3.0145,6.0339,0.8667,1.7943,4.2959,0.7643,0.8119,1.9172,1.9022,0.7951,5.7914,2.8545,0.5884,0.8305,3.3265,1.2861,0.2616,0.3969,0.0002,4.2536,1.7611,1.6675,1.7488,0.5102,2.6208,5.9305,5.2018,2.1991,6.4959,0.4714,5.5675,5.025,0.4654,0.0315,4.8067,0.3843,3.8595,1.0641,1.2704,2.144,2.2071,3.5845,0.0101,2.3319,0.0315,0.6364,3.7572,1.5353,0.7818,0.7175,4.9202,4.9124,0.0643,3.0394,4.612,2.9751,5.4907,0.0046,2.8939,3.8255,1.2708,4.5111,0.0045,3.3954,0.001,0.744,0.076,0.0002,0.7681,2.8311,0.7301,0.8962,0.6483,0.2757,5.3731,1.7358,0.8453,4.3412,0.0255,2.5998,0.6512,2.5496,0.7099,1.857,3.2654,3.0876,0.7866,0.6832,0.733,0.2207,0.1056,0.8002,2.3499,4.0016,2.5707,3.9753,0.5849,1.9768,3.9631,1.4312,3.9399,5.4214,0.904,1.0009,0.0041,1.4084,0.6983,2.7737,0.1992,0.333,0.0371,0.0002,1.3711,1.2401,1.0956,1.7752,4.6393,1.8308,0.2995,0.0017,0.0003,0.0163,1.4403,4.0166,1.5282,0.0831,0.0524,1.7036,1.1841,1.0429,2.4557,1.3232,0.7468,1.9613,3.5723,1.0401,0.0022,0.131,0.3766,0.984,3.869,1.7037,1.1457,1.1027,3.4541,0.5746,2.4106,0.5901,0.8577,0.0003,5.7382,0.0949,0.0002,0.0004,0.0,0.0001,0.0]}

{"id":1274,"ended":true,"length":345,"gen_text":"Daily Prompt : The Alphabet Game [ Difficulty level : HARD ]\n\nQuest Description: This is the game of letters, and the players have to decipher them in order to make it to the top of the leaderboard.\n\nSolution: I'm not a fan of the classic board game Letters, so I decided to try something different.\n\nFirst and foremost, the letters have to be placed on the board in four different ways, and that's it. The letters must be arranged in some specific way so that you have two options:\n\nYou're the king and have one letter on each box It's a draw - you'll be forced to draw from a box you don't want by placing a letter on the box you don't want\n\nNo other options are provided. The letters start off appearing one at a time, from a single box, and can be rearranged, moved, or placed using a simple interface.\n\nThe top player gains points for each letters that appear in their box, and for each line of the alphabet. A player's score for each letter they own is their score after the draw phase, when they have to draw from a box they don't want.\n\nIt's a 5-player game, but with only two different board placements per game. At the beginning of the game, the game starts with players having four letters on their board, so it makes two games.\n\nI've always loved this game, and that's even before the graphical updates and various expansions, and I'm glad that the game has been kept up to date by a dev team that is known for good RPG and roguelike-style games. I'm also quite a fan of the original game, which was released in 1999 and has even received a remake in 2015 titled Letters From Undermountain.","token_len":373,"entropy":[12.6728,6.0409,3.8379,10.608,5.6739,5.5951,9.5888,6.4225,0.5844,6.7976,0.484,0.3062,1.4953,0.0358,4.88,3.0617,0.5213,3.939,1.0466,1.6455,3.0629,1.9133,1.1752,1.6788,1.4988,2.143,4.4444,2.3896,0.3096,4.6557,3.0028,2.4017,0.8655,0.204,3.2409,1.8112,0.7408,0.1051,4.0511,0.7436,0.0817,2.1785,0.5673,0.3617,1.4461,0.0001,5.731,0.7006,4.7387,2.5387,1.255,3.1218,1.9744,0.0312,1.208,6.2036,4.4136,0.1706,4.0678,0.9604,1.2238,0.3052,2.1132,0.0511,3.0184,1.4454,1.4454,0.5166,2.2531,0.0001,3.0469,5.9044,0.0534,0.116,2.1692,3.3027,1.9421,0.1941,0.1921,2.995,1.5777,0.5433,0.9709,0.7777,7.4672,1.1704,1.4351,1.9468,1.86,3.4857,0.6943,1.9865,0.2388,2.3463,2.0399,3.36,0.508,2.2314,0.5285,4.5122,3.804,1.2998,2.4712,0.2342,3.8258,2.7247,4.6391,4.4829,2.3602,1.2541,0.0002,2.4762,5.1485,3.7766,6.3354,2.1713,2.4712,3.5063,1.1077,2.2035,1.513,6.3995,7.1056,0.0911,1.2175,1.5072,4.529,1.472,4.1133,2.4934,3.5527,0.0307,2.989,2.4575,1.7326,1.1906,3.0885,0.7667,0.0007,1.3782,5.3285,2.3808,1.5914,0.2625,1.1169,1.4925,2.229,0.582,1.0392,0.0004,0.153,1.4062,0.0002,5.9073,2.9435,2.6859,0.8964,3.1739,1.0251,2.4095,2.628,6.3082,1.8176,5.4549,3.2569,0.7492,0.011,0.0018,0.7373,4.7198,1.9761,4.2081,1.0283,1.0051,0.8063,3.9623,0.7963,1.8631,0.0005,3.4658,2.1944,0.643,0.9148,4.3236,5.7297,2.3438,3.0824,4.6765,0.356,0.8958,0.0002,1.6572,5.6877,2.2979,6.5726,1.6214,0.6934,0.758,5.224,1.4908,3.388,1.7364,1.4292,0.557,0.7261,0.5504,3.9664,0.6636,5.5974,1.0049,1.4388,1.5946,3.052,4.1102,1.8494,1.9888,0.6984,3.6408,1.4246,0.7604,3.0352,4.7769,0.4482,2.4836,1.673,4.142,1.4098,3.8978,2.0065,1.2967,5.0359,0.9848,1.7617,0.5159,1.4938,0.4834,0.6611,0.355,0.5055,0.1363,0.0003,0.05,0.3745,0.6465,0.0002,4.1165,0.5112,1.4536,6.0515,0.8093,2.1705,0.139,0.5467,2.1008,4.0586,2.3477,1.8975,5.0747,3.9462,4.8247,0.0049,2.3728,2.2626,0.7344,5.7862,0.2957,2.4196,0.1393,0.6324,0.0902,0.1414,1.5387,3.0298,2.2786,0.6395,3.9289,3.6373,3.1768,0.8579,2.0503,0.8585,1.6891,0.7929,3.2012,2.3458,4.6466,5.1715,1.5347,1.7072,1.2575,0.0002,3.2745,2.4989,4.7871,2.2794,2.8369,0.3443,0.5019,0.6731,5.2637,0.3033,6.9248,0.8461,2.6015,5.8038,2.0191,2.738,5.2357,4.4527,2.7756,2.1468,1.2039,1.4288,2.2777,1.68,2.931,1.086,1.6008,1.7078,3.7119,2.8909,0.3121,0.0899,3.8457,3.4503,4.5412,0.4038,0.7481,2.3132,5.5427,0.1884,4.3703,6.4357,3.0271,2.1064,0.0009,0.0242,4.2498,1.552,0.2565,0.2207,2.5574,1.5935,2.9325,4.7459,5.0919,0.2635,0.0198,0.802,3.2564,1.4441,0.4479,2.76,2.3342,1.806,0.8792,2.6918,2.6434,2.3041,5.6692,2.9772,0.7137,1.5069,1.5572,2.1595,7.0894,3.1402,2.5151,5.5059,0.5793,0.0052,0.2671]}

None of them but you are aware of each others true nature. And you, you are a...\n\nNatalie Babbitt is an action hero... who can't seem to escape her...\n\nWith all due respect to the likes of Michael Knight, Mike Myers, Jack Black, Kevin Conroy and other Hollywood actors, Natalie Babbitt is not a movie star. In fact, she's nothing more than an action hero on the side, and this is where her story gets interesting. Natalie is the star of this flick, being one of the few female action heroes in the entire genre. This is largely due to her strength and determination, and as the movie progresses, this determination takes on a whole new degree of seriousness. This movie feels a lot more like a graphic novel than anything else, which makes it easier to get into. The acting is decent, the directing is decent and the script is decent. As far as action comedies go, we have hit or miss here and there. Babbitt takes center stage in a lot of the action in this film, and when she doesn't, she takes a lot of flak for it. This leads to some really interesting moments, but some of them are a bit one note. When Babbitt comes back (she is still the lead) after leaving the military, she doesn't just show up without any explanation and try to find out what happened; she takes some heavy lumps in return. It's never the character that is the problem -- it's just the way this one episode plays out. It's just odd when you see Natalie in these kinds of situations and you can't help but think, what if?","token_len":374,"entropy":[5.6915,2.6071,1.672,4.4447,4.2271,2.355,4.1035,5.4876,1.1018,0.212,0.4558,6.3036,0.2946,0.8231,6.3803,3.1279,0.2118,2.2316,3.8879,0.6017,1.0688,2.9691,7.0615,7.5525,1.2672,4.4395,0.2083,0.5184,2.4978,4.0794,2.359,6.2499,0.0108,2.2256,9.3346,0.9889,1.8637,4.3899,0.2514,4.4581,1.97,4.3411,1.3015,0.7739,3.1308,2.0152,4.8394,2.3147,0.8174,2.5896,5.8346,1.5513,0.0299,5.3681,5.299,5.21,1.1967,0.014,1.8002,2.0264,5.3637,2.6023,5.3281,3.7554,2.8365,0.8643,2.9337,0.0056,3.8345,1.0868,6.7047,1.613,0.0001,5.3264,3.9291,4.1186,0.0492,0.4227,1.6438,3.298,0.0041,4.9948,6.6159,0.7237,5.8318,3.6571,0.2945,4.6666,0.7596,0.314,4.6244,3.8703,0.0021,1.7136,4.1113,3.7931,2.6141,0.5997,0.8171,0.0824,0.0024,0.0001,0.5269,2.5301,1.4462,1.9356,0.0412,0.2206,3.0398,0.1368,0.1548,0.7894,0.9755,4.907,0.7149,0.0134,2.0387,1.3172,0.5367,4.8984,0.9697,2.5914,2.0026,2.5599,4.0504,1.1939,2.9002,1.416,3.0742,2.2373,0.8382,0.1826,3.3546,1.3089,2.5762,3.1856,0.1707,3.9853,4.626,0.48,6.3617,3.3493,0.0588,0.2304,1.4894,1.9572,0.5787,0.3494,1.2072,0.8198,2.6888,2.3297,0.5296,3.8871,1.1235,4.7335,0.5411,0.0112,1.2315,5.4862,1.1214,3.0666,0.9931,1.8805,4.104,2.3113,1.7034,0.4087,0.6145,3.668,3.365,4.22,1.4714,0.4434,2.1085,0.0734,7.1768,0.0993,3.4388,0.4969,3.0649,2.4286,6.0615,3.6091,0.4602,1.433,1.0418,0.4072,5.0627,0.0161,0.4085,2.6028,0.133,0.6814,2.5177,2.4012,0.9483,4.6749,0.2606,2.8298,0.6867,0.9435,2.0469,3.922,0.5806,4.4697,0.5894,2.4936,3.3559,0.3413,3.189,2.4275,0.3362,3.3457,0.2382,0.7748,0.742,4.1635,1.7804,0.005,3.1389,5.1967,0.0002,0.0635,0.0493,5.4388,1.9529,6.1523,0.6161,0.0051,2.3462,0.3489,0.0062,1.5792,4.5051,0.0904,0.0006,5.2739,4.6144,0.0226,1.809,2.4535,1.8851,0.013,0.9459,1.2829,4.9721,0.4029,1.6513,0.2579,1.1428,4.3542,0.3344,3.3988,0.0006,0.8352,1.3716,4.3983,1.8961,1.921,0.0374,2.2896,0.4823,0.7366,0.0938,0.1748,2.8423,3.3789,0.1844,1.6399,2.9535,2.9349,1.908,1.1166,1.88,3.6533,0.7775,1.1423,1.2129,1.8146,0.8917,5.8061,2.267,0.5088,5.0652,2.3621,0.007,0.0003,5.9068,2.5786,6.9638,3.763,2.3352,4.5442,2.2409,2.4069,1.2707,2.1547,5.5105,0.742,4.0784,0.6224,0.4822,3.7478,0.0005,4.0397,3.767,0.1075,4.8522,2.3864,0.6336,3.7519,4.6154,0.1317,3.7373,1.9215,0.6455,0.5784,4.3611,0.2485,3.3407,2.8949,6.9936,4.9193,0.0075,3.0813,3.7701,0.3303,2.4587,0.6354,5.2312,3.8424,4.2043,1.8224,1.7129,0.9009,0.2609,6.6196,0.4554,0.0346,2.8858,0.8943,1.6766,3.8056,5.6373,5.5055,2.5745,0.0511,0.202,2.4613,0.621,3.9236,5.6762,4.5001,1.3797,2.3754,3.342,2.8041,3.5722,3.8981,0.0022,1.0409,1.7907,1.8765,2.6361,0.2765,0.5172,0.0481,1.508,1.1893,3.9483,2.4929,1.8726]}

For the long walk, or long vacation, you will have to come into the studio with little inspiration and little inspiration can only be found inside oneself, and the artists must find their strength and passion, and not find a new way to paint.\n\nIf you can not find the beauty of color in yourself or in yourself through painting then you will find the beauty of color not within yourself but somewhere else outside of you.\n\nWe encourage your journey to find your own personal way of using color to give yourself the power to paint, which will then enable you to explore beyond your limits, and give you the ability to create anything you can imagine.\n\nIf you found this article interesting please take a moment to share it with your Facebook, Google+.\n\nAlso, check out our color guide to help you find the colors that will complete your palette.

{"id":3957,"ended":true,"length":381,"gen_text":"You wake up surrounded by a warm dark liquid. Upon further inspection you realise you are inside a womb. You are in fact in a space station orbiting earth and everything you need is there to keep you alive. In this space station are also two scientists who are trying to discover the secrets of time and space. When you awaken you quickly find that you have been abducted by the scientists and taken to a research lab located in a desert. The scientists have been experimenting on you with special technologies and have gone to some interesting places in the process. When you wake up it will be the end of your universe. Everything you are and have ever been will have vanished and you will die. If you survive this the scientist will come to you one day and tell you the reason you have been brought here. You will then have to pick up some new gear and start searching for a way out. How did you get here? You were brought here on a ship and there are a number of anomalies which show that something went wrong some time ago. You will also have to determine exactly what happened in this time in which you were abducted. You should have already heard a few rumours about what really happened to you when you got here but you can never be completely sure until you finally decide to find out for yourself. The rest of the game will consist of your own adventure as you travel to unknown planets. If you don't find yourself dead then maybe you will manage to survive this final act in time. Do not trust the game's characters and try to stay alive as long as possible to discover more about your past and future. It is very likely that you will end up in a time loop where the only way you escape is to live in this time loop. This is the only way to leave the time loop permanently. Your choices in the past could determine if you eventually end up in another time loop or not.","token_len":381,"entropy":[9.6683,0.0606,6.6204,0.0239,2.2866,6.4474,7.2045,5.1315,1.0527,7.2819,2.6148,0.7467,1.2031,3.6854,2.0578,0.5191,3.8945,0.4246,7.5696,0.8237,1.3044,1.6502,2.5819,3.5755,2.3023,0.5674,5.4985,1.4158,2.2062,4.2424,2.3535,6.0225,1.9735,3.8384,1.2931,2.23,2.6045,2.9054,0.0288,0.5196,0.4567,4.5564,2.4321,2.0894,0.1514,2.3536,4.1749,3.7009,3.8679,1.3771,0.9594,2.0479,0.0704,3.4452,1.3088,2.0926,0.1493,4.0765,1.2215,0.2619,0.5178,4.9144,0.7951,3.8905,0.8908,5.5102,2.1661,1.6533,0.8083,1.2982,1.3358,3.7085,0.5795,1.2465,0.5874,1.1115,1.5369,0.406,1.3923,2.7257,2.4433,4.8934,1.0793,1.6513,4.5374,0.7218,2.1473,0.9141,1.8918,2.3504,2.4105,0.3979,0.274,3.4168,5.3701,4.8139,1.2713,2.248,5.6878,1.722,2.7174,5.8141,0.3068,2.3268,1.3975,1.4722,0.1455,4.4268,0.296,2.4998,0.0945,4.2021,3.8952,0.465,3.2821,2.9642,0.0407,1.8829,6.0439,0.968,5.2776,0.6634,3.6179,2.078,1.8377,0.5716,1.7116,1.3331,1.4609,3.1689,1.7142,0.7689,0.14,4.7092,0.6411,3.8429,0.0919,1.7819,2.1775,3.5278,4.2094,0.4546,4.4159,1.3869,1.2185,4.4007,0.5135,0.4225,1.8154,0.0078,2.2516,2.6188,1.8341,1.9334,0.3933,2.6332,0.5545,0.5422,1.8686,0.527,1.4575,1.7482,0.6867,5.5409,1.6348,4.9895,2.8286,2.979,0.6211,2.1941,5.302,0.2221,1.0613,0.742,1.0734,0.7843,5.6602,5.0741,0.3293,0.6271,0.0686,0.2227,3.6833,2.8034,3.2487,0.2408,3.9738,0.6833,2.5467,2.2443,4.3789,1.979,2.933,1.52,0.0057,4.3793,3.6909,5.1355,0.9617,3.1707,2.8054,0.5061,7.6724,0.3515,0.4366,0.2979,1.8617,1.2771,2.8706,1.4857,0.1096,5.4861,4.3391,0.4101,0.7749,2.7762,2.5416,2.2055,3.7123,3.4283,0.3902,0.9438,1.6313,0.396,2.2621,5.0842,2.9835,4.5248,3.4768,3.3055,2.6087,4.1588,0.7223,1.7827,4.2601,0.0589,1.5255,0.3012,4.0224,0.0742,4.2408,0.3538,2.6067,1.2499,2.9754,1.6569,0.9139,3.7793,0.1433,1.8259,0.1383,4.9898,4.4727,0.337,2.3628,0.1423,1.3052,0.0679,0.1817,2.6891,5.7547,0.0805,0.4063,0.4153,0.9745,2.8126,0.0371,4.0683,3.6298,1.9931,2.5673,0.1104,3.2999,2.3939,5.6432,2.0547,3.2602,4.1756,0.122,4.0507,0.0015,2.6087,4.0592,3.8008,2.9455,4.4959,0.6601,1.2423,4.872,0.0148,1.7813,2.5886,5.0999,3.9545,3.4268,2.8673,0.6243,5.6932,1.96,5.2982,1.272,5.9468,1.2669,5.906,2.1557,2.8906,0.4181,3.3685,1.6354,1.3482,0.306,0.0081,0.6912,3.7863,2.6495,2.5423,0.5621,1.7256,1.7204,1.086,2.6581,0.1894,3.8715,0.7771,3.2417,2.1444,0.35,0.7982,0.2234,3.7261,0.0449,2.1966,0.9274,4.0918,1.3155,2.4961,3.038,2.0006,0.5283,2.5739,5.1007,0.3628,0.8415,5.0204,2.8119,3.3357,1.864,0.4789,1.9456,2.7686,1.0008,2.0097,1.2683,0.2496,0.5653,4.9072,1.2331,0.9659,0.0192,4.7831,0.5423,4.9715,3.27,1.6406,0.536,3.9766,5.3576,3.0361,2.6969,0.1522,6.1134,1.991,0.0062,0.523,3.3957,0.5837,0.0945,0.787,0.6615,0.1133]}

The advertising campaign begins. You pick. The second spot for a smoker, and you are asked to pick a spot where you will be smoking your last cigarette. The advertising campaigns is over. The person asks you if you are sure and when the campaign is over. The person tells you what he or she does for a living and give you a voucher that can be used to have your funeral. This is the price of your soul. You look at your card with dread. As soon as you are out of the building, you smoke your last cigarette and you do your last last burn. As a smoker, your days are numbered, and you will die without ever trying again. When are you going to change your mind? Can you help yourself or can you help someone else?\n\nThe last word about the last cigarette is that you cannot quit on your own. You must have good reason to stop smoking. This reason is your health. This reason is the price of your own life. This reason is your death.\n\nThe most horrible thing about living with the burden of one's own death is that, once the last cigarette is smoked, it may be impossible to do anything to put it out of your mind. The thought of your death is almost overwhelming. When the cigarette is over you must start all over again at the beginning, without the thought of suicide.\n\nThe best thing you can do to avoid living with the burden of your own death is to give up smoking. That is not a suggestion. It is a request. It is a mandate. This is my responsibility. It is the greatest responsibility I can take on. I have to try to do my part before I can start to save myself.","token_len":383,"entropy":[7.1346,2.1223,2.5546,4.0625,1.2196,0.4178,3.1255,1.3883,2.2842,3.0964,11.9286,2.7213,0.4014,2.3593,14.4,14.9147,2.4851,5.1022,5.6605,7.7994,10.972,1.1644,1.683,1.5823,4.2037,1.0031,3.9891,1.0342,5.1259,2.7519,0.201,1.2642,1.9463,3.7431,2.6462,2.2623,5.1749,3.4679,3.6132,1.2932,1.4137,2.7879,2.9703,2.0014,5.9273,2.3962,6.3211,2.4432,5.0785,3.2521,3.7039,1.9996,1.5078,1.453,0.3627,0.8751,0.4898,0.421,0.9457,0.0871,0.0801,0.1177,3.4779,4.1682,0.7129,0.0395,0.0902,1.4523,1.1553,5.5299,4.1206,2.4761,0.2866,1.9367,5.2079,4.1737,0.5778,2.2357,0.1084,1.3333,2.988,3.7611,5.0333,2.7146,4.1286,0.6289,0.0494,2.5511,1.8608,0.7307,3.0155,0.0325,4.3334,3.1589,1.5736,0.0022,3.1394,1.2943,0.0292,0.0072,1.4962,6.2516,0.4486,0.6737,5.9542,2.5627,2.1123,0.0754,0.9215,1.095,5.1024,1.7968,6.6586,2.307,3.8675,0.7403,1.3081,6.7118,0.996,1.9506,4.2283,0.318,1.7481,4.1254,0.5785,2.1772,5.4563,4.0504,3.8324,0.5202,5.3532,3.6152,0.0099,0.2891,3.3227,2.6545,0.1067,0.3023,2.6762,0.5355,0.4457,5.6246,1.2103,0.1428,0.0439,1.667,2.2478,4.8692,3.884,0.9635,5.6929,6.0929,0.4578,4.0491,3.4628,1.191,0.3158,3.079,5.06,0.3153,0.0337,2.5081,0.8027,1.0585,1.8759,1.6277,3.239,1.5457,4.1116,2.2813,0.142,4.7499,6.6726,0.1965,0.334,0.0109,5.5808,0.7452,0.8898,0.328,5.1138,0.1574,5.041,2.6103,3.5707,2.8491,0.1654,0.8496,1.5689,0.1439,0.2956,2.6299,0.1353,2.199,4.7401,5.3228,4.5195,1.7263,2.6591,0.3994,1.0085,1.4237,1.5712,3.2278,2.0915,3.801,0.0785,0.0062,0.1825,1.1758,1.6709,2.8195,5.9828,4.2197,0.4168,2.9513,0.9997,0.5363,3.3929,1.6791,1.918,3.3508,2.8686,0.4116,3.9517,0.541,0.1933,1.7555,4.3864,0.6978,0.3828,4.7949,0.9465,0.1119,1.7026,0.0741,0.1367,1.6845,5.2538,0.3609,1.9914,0.0001,2.2035,4.3408,6.1495,1.3354,0.4762,6.3244,1.6105,2.586,4.0511,0.0324,5.4045,0.3351,0.9796,1.0154,0.1296,0.3461,4.3621,3.5915,2.6863,3.0369,0.115,0.1682,0.6706,0.076,2.051,4.4793,0.8879,2.2193,0.1099,3.8343,0.4367,2.1609,6.3812,1.123,0.3918,0.3664,0.2265,0.1805,0.1757,2.317,3.9042,0.4868,2.0424,1.2873,1.5625,4.0457,3.2063,0.2894,3.8083,2.5613,1.6176,0.4386,5.7538,3.588,3.913,4.6787,1.379,0.006,0.1709,5.1111,0.7858,0.3155,2.2093,4.0118,1.004,4.3513,0.1762,5.9948,0.3776,1.578,0.0002,2.1591,3.7302,1.3869,0.4521,0.0175,0.0171,1.2216,2.6239,5.5803,0.217,0.4185,0.6034,0.0137,0.6486,0.0662,0.0664,0.0703,0.066,4.1984,0.8625,0.1945,0.3123,4.5772,0.611,3.4416,2.2209,2.9942,1.1098,0.7358,0.0303,0.3655,4.4089,0.2265,1.7052,0.0919,0.547,5.0602,0.2086,4.4259,0.4476,5.2152,5.4684,1.0203,2.5242,0.0627,1.962,4.482,1.2876,1.5572,1.237,2.2894,0.1813,0.4099,1.641,2.2409,2.4258,3.7873,0.7116,3.1076,2.0735,1.33,5.6649,1.0457,1.9051,4.4308,1.1038,4.7644,2.8746,0.2345]}

This angel is just as determined to live forever as its human is.\n\nGod has promised in the Bible to kill the firstborn child of every person he finds in Hell, including all the children of Lot and those that follow him.\n\nThere is not a single time in the Bible that God has expressed any intention to help humanity except when he is speaking to us through the Bible.\n\nGod tells us what he wants us to do. God tells us what happens to his beloved Son Jesus, and he tells us what happens to us if we do not live the moral and religious life that he has chosen for us. Yet most people would be hard pressed to state which of these is more important.\n\nWe tend to worship Satan instead of God, and our society is too fragmented with hate, hatred, and hate to find any hope or resolution in the Christian religion any longer. As far as there is one thing that we can do to live a better life, that is it.\n\nI believe in God, not in any supernatural creature. I believe there is not a God. I believe in evolution, not the notion of a creator. And I believe humans can choose their own way to live.\n\nI do not believe that the way to change people is by forcing your own god on them. I believe there are other ways to change human hearts, hearts that we can work towards. I believe that we can do better.\n\nIn that, I believe God is trying to help me.

So this I say with confidence, my little girl, God loves you very much.\n\nThank you for reading my blog and my response.","token_len":384,"entropy":[1.3609,9.3922,7.0301,5.7255,3.1048,2.705,1.9359,4.8355,2.1803,3.3962,3.9166,0.4552,1.4617,1.1112,3.8455,2.751,2.9237,4.3808,1.5317,6.1123,1.6094,7.999,0.5629,5.1378,3.4029,0.1776,5.4671,1.0169,6.8686,1.428,1.6521,0.014,5.3661,2.9786,4.2153,4.2092,0.6494,0.5958,1.386,5.5394,1.7352,3.3469,2.4733,3.4251,0.7894,0.6388,2.1522,2.1254,3.0629,2.8082,2.8295,1.6453,3.5,3.3564,1.5136,2.9888,0.2543,5.9629,2.4685,4.2811,3.3311,3.5396,1.0743,1.0047,1.8319,0.0001,3.5566,0.9376,4.3866,0.7525,0.6495,5.1401,0.3802,0.3493,0.3451,1.3453,0.6972,3.0984,4.8981,1.41,4.3985,0.9277,3.719,3.2795,4.3292,2.0265,1.0931,1.8843,4.9115,0.9141,3.184,2.8404,1.4168,0.9478,0.3308,0.8447,0.0002,1.5517,5.095,0.8579,5.48,1.5813,0.9625,1.0511,0.0083,0.2701,1.969,3.7073,1.3589,0.0493,0.8032,4.5854,0.9105,4.1559,4.9808,3.3644,3.4738,2.218,0.8349,1.5933,0.8072,0.0281,0.7023,0.6627,0.1178,2.184,2.1357,0.0162,1.5321,0.2806,3.8518,2.5197,4.3948,2.2193,1.5604,1.2356,1.173,0.9165,0.6659,4.0647,0.1313,0.0428,0.1284,5.1743,5.0155,1.5869,4.3738,3.0932,1.4661,0.2356,0.0162,5.4862,2.973,0.8609,0.492,2.8239,1.397,0.1954,0.7789,0.4822,0.0002,3.6849,6.4358,0.024,4.5932,5.2991,3.3048,0.1423,0.3903,1.5817,0.882,4.3573,4.1159,1.3552,5.4329,5.6813,5.458,5.6318,1.3176,4.1872,0.4206,0.684,1.7334,1.6617,4.6522,1.9863,4.5621,2.4478,5.4364,1.8433,1.7428,4.2338,0.9031,5.2955,1.331,0.042,5.1067,4.1031,0.0414,5.4742,0.3059,2.1087,1.9895,0.6431,1.8071,0.7583,1.9813,0.8035,4.7644,1.1797,1.7136,0.2325,0.3564,3.1541,0.3482,1.9867,0.137,0.7469,0.0002,3.3106,2.7377,2.8465,1.6153,0.9742,4.6132,1.3597,2.8833,2.7588,4.6226,0.8431,0.6316,0.341,4.2458,0.2266,5.1432,0.2227,2.2766,1.5752,0.52,0.2267,1.6339,4.369,0.8622,0.6493,2.6898,5.4299,1.0098,0.8333,1.5538,0.834,4.003,0.2661,0.1775,6.4088,3.0835,3.3436,3.0697,0.2181,2.6997,2.0151,0.3018,1.4317,0.7237,0.0002,1.6443,2.627,0.1519,0.5599,1.2113,2.1998,4.6372,0.9439,5.3276,3.2433,0.6602,1.8676,2.9857,4.5179,3.0195,5.4576,0.8066,0.0509,0.4684,0.8384,0.7999,3.4782,1.0142,3.6173,0.3905,1.0387,1.5612,5.0569,2.2657,1.5148,3.6511,0.2714,4.3432,1.029,3.46,3.5684,1.5055,1.6723,0.3303,0.8568,2.309,0.7541,4.2169,1.8655,1.6514,0.6383,0.0002,4.2686,4.4542,3.2553,0.2542,1.7277,4.0049,0.667,4.8697,0.0946,1.8605,1.6333,0.6692,4.0258,1.1006,4.0428,0.8598,1.2712,2.8225,2.7952,1.1956,3.8724,5.1853,2.6336,0.7752,0.0639,2.8414,0.5079,2.5653,4.5398,0.9881,0.8036,1.7081,0.5795,2.5428,5.3493,0.536,7.3173,1.5596,0.6139,2.0065,2.215,0.6387,0.606,5.358,5.0408,6.5458,2.341,4.4355,3.3034,1.2899,4.0818,5.8688,3.9368,1.0263,4.1824,1.6394,0.0494,3.9934,0.049,0.5586,1.1028,0.0002,4.0093,0.0403,0.8971,1.1049,2.2437,1.557,2.6421,3.703,5.4351,1.1108]}

I hope the translation of the other languages will speed up the rate at which I can complete my book.","token_len":385,"entropy":[0.203,7.0744,6.2466,5.8848,5.281,2.8783,0.3586,1.4988,2.3973,7.3205,5.3476,4.4188,2.333,2.1272,0.8354,2.0076,4.21,4.5008,6.0409,5.1576,1.196,3.6685,0.0118,1.7928,6.1414,4.2884,0.3385,1.7618,0.0102,5.9628,5.3603,4.1336,0.164,0.0611,4.9864,2.2289,4.616,5.3246,0.9562,0.1804,4.7751,0.6644,0.0002,1.8647,4.309,1.2462,1.6639,5.0836,5.4746,2.991,0.7403,6.2101,5.4734,0.9756,4.4292,3.2735,1.4893,2.4061,0.0002,4.397,4.7448,4.5044,2.8747,5.2242,1.737,2.5787,1.7955,5.5004,2.6357,2.1367,4.4577,3.1402,0.2783,0.7457,2.513,1.0297,2.346,0.0002,2.6173,3.6993,0.1245,0.0019,0.0172,0.5622,0.0002,1.2692,2.7498,4.0954,4.5928,1.9605,2.1119,2.3328,4.1555,2.1819,0.9672,3.1699,2.1317,0.7312,0.3615,5.0078,2.7185,0.3288,0.475,3.866,5.8942,1.7778,0.4322,1.8288,5.5387,1.9564,1.5339,0.0002,4.26,3.8387,3.3607,6.1974,1.1623,0.9385,1.52,1.2017,4.9262,0.5443,3.0854,2.1183,1.8023,5.6098,5.7946,1.3198,1.5236,2.8539,2.9854,0.4598,0.6801,0.1248,0.7477,0.0002,3.7004,6.7013,1.835,2.3204,0.8708,0.8063,1.1672,2.0856,3.2881,7.8016,4.7931,3.4158,4.178,0.9933,5.322,2.9525,4.274,2.0752,0.3989,0.2536,0.2789,0.8325,0.4809,0.0002,5.2133,1.0303,1.0538,3.9054,2.9816,6.4756,5.1582,2.2986,5.6216,1.9142,1.4498,4.9321,1.3551,0.0018,2.2086,0.9251,3.0996,0.0517,1.2131,3.8769,2.6414,3.8521,1.5607,0.4603,0.0002,1.7457,2.6291,0.0494,0.0095,0.0084,0.0059,0.2628,0.0002,4.0895,2.0223,3.6425,6.2639,0.0923,0.3569,1.8473,10.3966,2.1132,4.88,2.2933,2.5397,5.1482,3.8937,1.4922,7.7363,3.1882,0.1841,5.0883,1.4172,0.4597,0.9842,0.0002,5.0685,1.3749,5.1727,0.151,3.9876,1.5786,3.7083,6.329,3.004,2.8487,5.1137,0.2478,3.7059,6.0094,4.7986,4.452,5.4345,3.587,2.0765,0.6636,1.3429,0.7413,0.1901,0.0002,3.7523,1.9546,5.5081,2.4093,5.3393,0.0888,3.0071,2.7764,1.3083,1.3728,5.5194,4.2253,0.3288,0.8531,0.0002,4.5172,0.4809,0.3979,1.8802,1.4212,0.043,3.5349,0.8546,1.3464,3.325,5.5824,3.5402,3.9967,1.7557,3.9728,0.5387,0.2071,0.0002,3.6342,0.1556,0.5581,5.6514,0.495,2.0579,1.9454,1.3283,0.0002,1.3816,3.4831,4.9414,3.8169,2.7683,2.4356,1.1966,1.4009,0.0437,0.0043,0.4478,0.0002,2.3165,0.2872,0.7326,2.8557,5.7604,0.5336,2.0793,0.2849,1.6149,1.8545,5.3668,2.0892,2.077,1.5285,0.0446,2.2857,1.7104,0.2515,0.2146,0.4362,0.0002,1.8036,3.4519,2.4398,3.4275,1.2125,0.1394,5.3847,3.6739,0.2167,4.615,3.6144,0.3702,1.0487,0.0002,3.1412,5.02,1.8829,0.8541,2.652,0.6637,1.1955,2.708,0.2116,3.2859,3.9198,0.2914,0.0943,1.2393,0.317,1.0854,1.106,1.9802,1.1172,0.3645,0.1103,5.8649,5.3207,0.0018,3.6585,5.095,0.8397,3.7338,2.4369,1.4495,1.8703,0.3379,1.2107,0.3049,2.4907,2.7424,2.658,1.9841,4.1531,0.5596,1.8487,0.3097,0.2246,6.5822,0.0939,0.755,5.5553,2.1359,0.01,0.7535,1.2879,3.9775,3.5042,2.6748,0.1611]}
{"id":3241,"ended":true,"length":361,"gen_text":"Far into the future, long after humans as we currently know them have disappeared, you are a Digital Archaeologist.

{"id":1108,"ended":true,"length":360,"gen_text":"You're a Jew in one of Hitler's concentration camps. You were sent here because you resisted joining the HJ. You find that your old best friend is a guard. You're told that in the camp there is only one kind of work to be done because nobody eats with them.' But the real Nazi concentration camps were actually places that ate their prisoners alive: Auschwitz, Dachau, Flossenb\u00fcrg, Stutthof, and others. The book also chronicles the atrocities and the atrocities that were omitted from the book: the mass-murders in the Baltic States that were never mentioned.\n\n\nThe book was one thing, the pictures and the films were another. The pictures aren't as graphic, with less blood, yet they evoke an unsettling feeling of horror. For example, a large group shows up in a village, and the villagers are forced to do hard labor. But a member of the group looks away and smiles knowingly. We will never understand, and there is no way to escape the feeling, but it is so unnerving.\n\n\nI also appreciated the introduction, the chapter in which the author traces the history of the German film industry and details the relationship between Fritz Lang, Alfred Hitchcock, and Peter Lorre. I found the chapter interesting, but one could also feel that it was meant for the public, with only a few words, and the chapter had been written so quickly that the author barely even addressed the history of the Nazis and their film business. It makes perfect sense to address these topics then as they were covered in the book, even if the book feels too quick-paced and lacks the depth that the author could have if he had just devoted a year to researching the topic.\n\n\nThis book makes for a great book club reading at dinner, a little more difficult at bedtime, or a lovely story to relax with with on the sofa.","token_len":386,"entropy":[2.1942,2.687,7.1663,4.1088,6.7178,0.6588,6.2861,0.007,2.3426,0.0108,1.3785,1.5168,4.3946,3.0264,3.175,1.2004,0.7832,6.452,8.1391,0.2495,7.7388,4.24,1.0258,1.4471,5.5899,2.7746,1.6637,5.3764,6.0245,0.0991,1.3392,2.0591,4.6237,1.3624,1.3775,2.9535,3.5194,0.9123,4.6256,1.9947,1.7678,1.8773,1.6734,3.7076,0.1793,4.126,0.0054,3.4126,3.6732,0.3716,0.0576,7.3705,5.1352,6.7919,4.8811,5.0256,6.609,4.8811,2.1669,4.171,5.6222,4.3076,0.8953,0.6109,5.184,4.0684,3.1348,4.8242,2.9903,0.9399,1.7777,4.9036,4.221,0.5092,1.0964,0.0034,0.0,0.1666,3.6226,0.0015,0.144,0.0047,0.0038,0.0328,0.5442,4.147,0.0571,0.0006,0.0027,0.7256,2.7808,2.6148,0.2389,2.1641,4.3125,3.5243,5.3177,0.0023,0.5914,5.1567,3.4346,1.9251,3.1901,1.4742,1.4569,6.3406,0.342,0.6304,2.8462,2.4824,0.9085,3.6749,3.8586,2.3583,0.008,0.0355,2.7477,0.9512,4.8371,1.1727,4.3833,1.128,1.6404,1.0832,2.1684,3.3073,0.0003,1.7625,1.4238,2.8981,4.9734,5.4662,0.8118,2.7475,6.9184,2.6869,0.5632,4.6202,0.7709,0.4985,0.2318,1.8444,2.3175,5.9876,0.0009,2.2243,3.7929,2.6759,6.2531,4.2448,1.5614,0.8276,6.7961,0.9514,6.3162,2.9772,4.7665,1.2886,1.4367,2.5004,0.83,4.3913,1.2755,0.0728,3.1776,5.4935,2.9779,9.4084,0.4142,1.8417,1.3004,3.5004,1.8598,2.0567,1.8592,3.0779,1.2305,2.6173,0.1641,4.7369,3.5198,0.237,1.1896,3.4318,3.7284,5.7142,0.0352,0.2565,0.2183,5.277,3.5425,1.7339,4.7311,5.4054,0.9411,4.2916,5.7208,0.4308,5.1988,3.4955,2.6851,4.2053,0.6505,0.5652,1.5288,0.4621,5.1026,1.2312,1.136,2.9211,1.892,1.5952,0.8945,4.5009,4.6423,0.0112,1.1524,1.2513,0.0003,2.7829,3.1916,4.2454,0.4666,6.0824,2.2813,3.0874,4.4082,3.3406,0.3324,1.0786,0.8647,5.3793,0.3457,1.6008,0.0697,0.6673,4.4043,3.8352,0.1053,2.0799,6.0872,0.6767,5.2133,0.2339,6.3127,0.0033,1.7118,3.7897,0.0315,0.1785,0.2317,5.4809,0.3155,0.0002,0.4043,2.687,2.4462,0.8909,1.7069,2.3999,0.8976,0.9845,5.6347,2.7333,3.3353,3.443,1.0119,1.1989,0.6611,4.8294,2.9783,1.6055,4.707,0.981,4.5125,3.9603,0.7113,0.7199,2.9928,3.4819,1.4077,2.5476,3.042,4.7297,3.9326,1.3686,3.9861,2.1082,0.8432,1.8524,0.8405,4.8164,4.1001,4.6196,0.3345,4.1616,0.1874,0.343,4.5497,1.4792,2.0265,2.0314,6.2937,0.2431,3.2076,5.1807,5.7274,0.0056,1.9103,6.0157,3.0404,1.5655,6.1958,5.3824,2.1653,1.8462,3.4966,0.3926,0.369,1.0252,0.5858,5.4937,0.6171,1.0349,2.1194,5.9059,3.9067,4.1739,4.358,1.0142,1.9244,3.7889,1.2607,1.8192,1.7939,1.9299,2.1989,2.1632,0.0996,5.7252,0.3097,0.5271,4.7082,3.8555,1.6917,4.0267,0.7311,1.4572,1.1453,1.3381,0.24,0.5283,0.0003,3.6266,0.8777,5.1655,2.1882,0.6504,1.5231,3.872,1.717,2.8128,5.8734,4.4829,1.0735,3.6446,5.2926,2.6111,3.4981,2.9975,4.2934,0.0832,0.9839,1.6166,1.7656,5.576,4.2138,0.4124,6.4057,1.403,3.6607,2.4142,1.6387,2.1246,0.308]}

However, God comes down to challenge the patents.\n\nIs it that people need to learn from their mistakes? The lesson to be learnt from cloning is that cloning cannot be done using an exact copy.\n\nThe Bible states that what God creates will be different but with God's guidance. God has told us that we must not copy God and thus He is our Creator yet we are being granted what he created. We are not granted the same things but we are given new things because God has changed us. So what has changed with us? Everything!\n\nTherefore we need to learn how to control our creation. If we follow God's commands we will not need to copy anything.\n\nWe cannot simply copy everything but we must learn how to keep things from changing.\n\nHere are some examples :\n\nIf parents want to give their offspring any medical treatment it is not their decision alone. We have the parents.\n\nIf God created Adam and Eve then it is His intention to make His creation in line with His image. If they become disobedient then God will punish them.\n\nIf a sperm from your father becomes fertilised by a sperm from your mother, one of you will be male and one will be female.\n\nIs there then any reason for a male and female sperm to fall in love and combine? This is something that God would never allow.\n\nWhat we see here, is that the reason that we do not see a man and woman having sex like two people is due to our sinful nature.\n\nIt is not necessary for God to create two sex cells but He can create two male and female cells for two persons. This is the way that He has created in the Bible.\n\nWhat I have stated here is the explanation of why things are done in different ways.","token_len":387,"entropy":[2.7776,4.6219,0.7628,6.1672,6.4513,1.8961,1.1117,3.1056,0.6034,0.234,4.6851,5.3545,0.1215,12.3578,4.3664,1.4903,4.3863,0.0658,8.1593,7.0847,1.6605,2.2613,7.8257,1.2621,3.7562,1.469,2.32,0.0079,5.6541,1.8987,6.3371,3.9799,4.2162,0.7037,3.8087,2.1877,2.163,0.1571,0.7222,4.1916,6.2988,3.7799,0.3754,3.1374,1.4392,2.2484,0.5886,0.5156,4.1196,4.5703,0.5697,1.7178,6.1111,4.4973,3.7181,1.2771,2.8353,1.9754,0.0002,2.2113,3.4929,3.0625,0.7668,6.1938,1.3955,2.8623,2.6013,0.7018,1.6515,6.029,4.6762,3.9396,0.4222,4.0011,1.3377,2.3969,2.875,3.5304,0.2779,0.6556,1.4861,2.3161,1.281,3.7802,1.779,3.1887,4.9472,3.9691,2.7571,5.7658,2.1264,7.137,1.0746,1.9686,4.5482,5.3115,6.062,3.731,0.9868,0.912,3.523,1.0512,2.3049,5.4488,1.0976,1.5774,3.5148,3.6985,1.166,0.3894,2.0284,5.8554,0.8875,3.9559,1.9077,1.5425,4.1464,2.2662,0.5038,4.408,2.7303,4.0293,1.9389,4.6758,1.7308,0.4089,6.2869,1.5751,0.8647,0.0002,5.3623,2.6251,2.2076,0.1054,1.8969,3.0177,0.1472,4.9841,0.7537,4.0457,1.0962,3.3716,0.5145,5.0588,0.5644,0.5104,4.0844,1.5596,0.6451,1.701,1.9167,0.41,2.4842,1.8805,0.6593,1.6885,0.0001,2.9701,3.3802,4.7539,1.734,3.7567,3.1972,0.5901,2.3569,1.5033,0.683,0.0452,5.6139,2.2811,3.1725,2.1808,0.5052,1.3403,0.0001,5.3481,0.8047,0.8285,2.1939,8.5144,0.1512,0.0001,3.3779,7.6311,1.9164,0.4056,2.3088,0.3433,4.3025,5.4697,3.624,0.5087,4.4256,1.2239,1.9609,2.4206,2.7967,2.667,0.818,3.7933,2.2637,2.603,4.8575,3.6847,1.1238,0.0002,1.1744,4.2532,1.7057,2.9336,0.2871,0.0069,1.7519,2.7388,0.6973,3.1769,4.4664,2.0542,2.7404,5.2838,1.93,3.5631,4.9126,0.0528,0.4449,2.8791,0.3282,2.5316,2.1776,4.4836,2.6818,0.0001,0.9374,1.2808,0.9506,1.7218,0.0999,0.6516,0.4664,0.0002,1.2177,2.0578,6.1651,4.0695,5.6997,1.1732,3.4394,2.2948,0.2213,0.5399,0.8897,0.8472,0.0528,1.2467,0.0629,1.7426,5.6867,0.8882,1.1469,0.4011,0.9946,3.8541,0.345,0.5323,1.1586,0.0073,0.0115,0.1319,1.1496,0.0002,5.698,2.7683,7.7982,1.9852,2.1936,1.7208,2.3076,4.0637,1.4079,0.2595,4.7112,0.24,6.3668,1.9438,0.6506,1.0376,2.8188,1.3795,3.85,0.5412,4.157,0.9682,1.3692,2.9205,1.4942,0.851,0.4015,0.5116,0.0002,3.853,3.7311,2.6164,2.6,4.5179,0.6788,0.5907,2.7244,5.3943,2.6812,1.7229,3.1174,0.2021,1.5134,2.2358,2.9752,0.161,0.8857,3.9691,0.8624,6.3935,4.7068,1.8565,1.5592,4.4612,0.0096,2.84,2.9155,1.0031,0.2826,1.3361,0.0002,3.5579,0.2594,1.5884,5.5134,0.6698,2.175,0.1147,1.0114,2.2179,5.0615,2.0626,2.8388,1.28,2.7616,1.4676,1.1696,4.2333,0.1059,0.2937,0.6744,4.2019,2.5121,3.7433,0.9791,2.4272,0.5172,2.3719,2.558,1.5482,1.6508,2.1594,0.6674,4.6532,0.7443,2.4151,0.3049,0.3934,0.0002,3.7399,4.369,1.4431,3.6676,1.2419,0.3183,2.6804,5.4586,1.3112,2.2845,5.1682,1.4858,3.1441,2.1384,4.4844,0.1035,0.6665]}

Ian McShane makes his first appearance as Ned Stark.\n\nJames Cosmo makes his debut as Ramsay Bolton, alongside Jessica Henwick.\n\nAnd the new cast member that has us most excited are two of the people who were most talked about but have never actually been on screen before: Max von Essen with his impressive German accent and new character Munt, and Michael McElhatton as Tyrion Lannister's brother, Tyrion Lannin.\n\nMax von Essen can't stop talking about his role as the new warden of the Wall, and there's so much here we want to say about it, so much that we'll talk about it in a podcast later! But in the meantime we'd like to give you a few spoilers and details, like this one:\n\nWe met Max von Essen (played by Michael McElhatton), the warden, who was also playing the new Warden of the Wall, on the set recently. He seemed genuinely surprised when we asked if this was really him.\n\nHe explained that the role had been a two-year journey. \"I always loved this character of the wall and had wanted to play him for a long time and he just kept getting better.\"\n\nBut it's just as well Max has a really nice accent on this show, as we expect that character is going to attract quite a lot of attention in season two.\n\nWhat do you think of this new cast addition to the show? Is Munt a good addition?\n\nWhat did you think of the return of Munt?","token_len":389,"entropy":[9.9435,0.001,0.0097,2.8796,6.5886,0.0842,9.6849,7.8948,2.6498,3.886,4.4068,3.0561,1.0963,0.0011,6.2053,3.1782,4.1052,4.7519,0.1478,2.853,2.1848,1.8845,2.2032,4.8842,6.0029,1.8595,1.0725,5.8373,2.1064,0.0002,0.0001,0.0002,0.265,4.0242,0.8978,1.2649,0.4709,0.0002,8.7103,11.9882,2.8934,0.0002,3.6629,1.5733,2.4725,3.4105,3.5998,1.6225,6.1292,0.0027,1.0842,5.4059,4.4203,3.6709,0.762,2.4285,2.7774,2.4697,3.7967,0.8664,0.508,0.1123,0.0002,1.7077,6.0541,0.228,0.1253,0.0001,4.3507,1.3499,1.8795,0.3903,0.501,5.5793,0.0781,1.7627,0.1657,0.0002,6.2567,0.8605,0.0067,2.8855,0.3476,1.8359,0.1529,4.1373,0.2865,2.4649,5.8905,5.5514,0.0403,0.0002,1.0407,0.0724,0.0002,4.6673,3.0303,3.6774,2.7122,2.5524,2.9744,2.5787,2.6738,1.7254,0.0612,4.4927,4.4078,1.7469,0.3642,5.472,1.0235,2.4672,4.0583,3.8269,0.0475,4.2164,2.8122,3.0262,1.8527,1.3702,1.7196,2.2934,1.8634,1.1651,5.1857,0.3999,3.9751,0.0053,7.6842,0.7541,5.5743,3.2904,0.0607,0.4194,5.042,1.1664,5.0965,5.7205,1.9517,1.0923,4.9084,0.8331,0.0508,0.0024,0.0011,0.9943,4.2787,0.0001,0.6002,0.0027,1.953,2.4523,2.4579,4.2276,0.0001,1.4684,6.7523,0.184,0.4463,0.0002,3.944,0.0663,0.0009,0.0053,5.7703,1.8059,2.7312,0.8849,0.1539,1.0768,1.6684,1.0606,2.5378,3.3612,5.231,0.4126,0.4148,0.5963,1.3585,1.4915,2.607,5.1625,0.6001,4.4108,0.0488,6.6283,2.5185,3.1925,0.0617,4.5446,3.0721,0.6908,1.2153,2.5569,3.6992,1.3124,0.2341,2.4753,5.6111,0.2329,0.2723,2.7286,2.2153,5.7068,2.4679,3.5901,1.6491,3.0605,0.0957,0.2108,3.4503,4.137,0.779,0.0678,2.418,0.6082,0.581,3.2018,4.0742,3.0141,3.7106,3.1966,5.0606,1.7231,2.9084,0.4667,0.7603,0.0002,3.5652,5.4147,1.5754,0.6525,0.0006,0.0043,3.9732,4.1579,0.0646,1.6257,0.0189,0.0028,0.0022,0.0011,3.2645,1.2794,1.8165,0.001,3.7039,2.8339,2.1913,4.2071,4.006,1.7566,2.5559,1.894,0.221,0.0501,0.0763,0.8565,2.7701,0.7782,0.9777,6.4522,0.5494,1.2696,4.8849,3.9098,2.923,1.7954,0.3824,1.1346,2.0877,4.5097,0.5357,3.0246,0.7496,1.0031,1.5775,0.0002,2.4312,3.6389,0.665,2.3291,3.0064,2.7496,0.6449,2.399,6.3899,0.2876,0.3203,2.6502,2.7094,1.8326,0.8184,4.623,4.0975,3.5169,1.1465,3.2119,0.9242,3.9292,2.0769,4.2201,2.8098,0.0417,0.4279,1.059,0.8013,1.1496,0.3964,0.0372,3.5411,4.8454,3.1271,2.1289,2.027,2.3911,3.1988,0.5651,0.0002,4.2199,2.6898,1.3886,4.8857,1.3779,0.9285,3.928,2.7603,1.4434,4.1425,2.9866,0.747,5.7128,3.0131,0.9878,1.1275,2.8992,2.1192,5.2554,2.1775,4.0339,3.0749,0.454,0.0038,6.5216,2.5305,0.0912,1.2581,0.0043,1.0935,2.9469,2.2917,2.2352,0.4008,0.43,0.0002,4.1547,1.1065,0.0551,0.1483,0.7843,1.9335,1.7548,0.5066,2.7558,2.3722,1.0156,0.942,0.1272,3.3402,2.5102,0.0089,1.7867,1.4296,0.926,1.9287,2.6331,0.0002,3.7221,1.5995,0.0562,0.0233,0.1816,0.7954,6.008,0.0279,2.6423,0.0525,0.453]}

According to the site, the Box is priced at $1,750 and is available for pre-purchase until September 30, 2015.\n\nThe Box\n\nThis item might look complicated, but it's really quite simple. Basically, it's just a giant vinyl record.\n\nIt also comes with a few other items: a small velvet box, a gold and diamond necklace (which you have to order separately), and two black diamond earrings.\n\nYou can also add a gold locket and a black diamond necklace, with silver or gold chains, which you may or may not be able to see on the screen.\n\nIs the Box in your living room?\n\nThe Box is currently available online, but the brand is considering a physical release in China. As far as we can tell, it's only available to Chinese customers, so some of the pieces won't work in North America, or indeed in any other countries.\n\nThat's not to say that the Box can't be ordered through American sites, although it's very unlikely that you'd be able to own one.\n\nThe box, which will ship from the brand's HQ in Taipei, is already available for pre-order in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. It will arrive in China on September 30.\n\nThere hasn't been much official word on the Box's arrival in other locales, including Britain, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWe also don't know when this limited release will be available at U.S. retailers, where prices are higher than in other countries. We're not holding our breaths.\n\nThe Box will be released at 12:01AM Pacific (2PM ET), September 30, on Pandora's Box site.","token_len":389,"entropy":[1.2414,2.0348,1.4202,2.9061,13.2317,9.2917,2.1068,4.073,2.2925,0.0121,6.4043,1.3183,6.1045,4.3421,0.2334,6.188,0.0084,1.2726,4.3982,0.4634,1.4664,5.8199,1.059,1.8172,0.164,0.4047,2.1516,0.0956,4.4987,2.4656,1.972,1.5122,1.5324,0.6414,0.1778,5.4321,0.0081,2.9513,2.7057,2.2045,1.3069,2.0789,0.1518,0.9106,0.0002,1.8698,2.0186,3.8709,0.0002,3.9585,4.441,6.0435,1.966,4.8111,0.6619,0.0581,0.7062,0.5644,1.8803,1.687,0.186,0.3542,4.7579,0.1885,1.0736,0.3478,2.9913,0.2635,4.8323,5.7938,1.4688,1.2332,1.3681,0.0002,2.548,3.4645,1.1871,0.2499,0.54,4.4806,2.4963,2.9999,2.8017,0.8541,3.6624,4.4077,3.5104,0.6094,0.532,5.3914,4.0108,3.4653,1.6889,3.6546,1.9178,2.8532,3.8859,0.059,3.4357,0.3041,0.3994,0.7664,3.5258,4.5747,4.3928,0.4101,0.0209,0.4011,0.2993,0.0002,3.2961,0.6297,1.8914,1.7289,0.8666,3.4144,5.8711,0.1297,1.7911,0.5743,3.0812,1.5185,2.14,2.5945,5.2253,6.1217,3.7648,1.2933,3.0023,1.1878,4.038,1.5823,5.4717,2.1567,0.0051,0.0038,2.4407,0.2625,0.0029,2.8969,2.6036,0.3641,5.0075,0.9217,0.2521,0.0002,5.0651,1.902,0.7459,5.687,3.1692,5.3832,0.0305,0.343,1.2451,0.0002,2.1666,1.296,0.8374,2.5939,1.0199,3.1659,1.5299,0.7139,2.2652,4.1735,1.5265,4.2077,2.3596,2.2467,1.8415,1.6492,5.7445,0.8405,5.0215,2.7071,0.0071,0.9914,1.8358,0.079,0.0557,1.7766,1.0067,2.8487,0.6374,1.8488,1.9555,1.7341,1.345,2.159,6.5136,1.9228,2.0037,4.9139,4.494,0.0003,3.5397,0.9103,3.6393,0.0955,2.9581,2.5939,4.1797,2.0816,1.6228,0.3854,1.8526,0.3901,0.2737,0.0002,4.2429,1.9492,1.2995,0.7764,0.0183,1.0091,0.8944,0.6738,3.0407,0.0083,0.5599,3.0941,3.0798,5.5665,4.2183,1.0312,3.9016,1.3855,1.3744,4.8599,0.7393,1.0562,1.5294,1.9982,0.8021,0.044,0.0014,6.12,0.8345,1.5255,0.603,0.0002,2.1357,3.1595,3.4869,2.3414,3.6869,3.1151,1.6089,1.8145,2.2385,0.08,3.1581,0.11,5.8492,0.0562,0.0733,1.3734,4.6448,1.1837,0.8062,0.1954,0.0579,0.1449,2.2167,1.3992,4.9469,0.8361,2.2619,0.0013,0.1976,1.3437,0.1836,5.8685,0.0013,0.1604,1.3132,2.0785,1.9432,0.2577,3.0887,1.2646,3.3049,0.3277,2.9899,0.9923,0.6714,0.3676,0.8939,0.1701,0.0002,4.1608,6.658,0.0003,0.0614,1.9236,3.3666,0.6982,1.0377,1.1106,0.8841,1.1736,3.5024,0.36,1.8576,7.7034,0.1267,0.4273,3.9482,5.6245,0.8046,2.8192,2.4386,0.445,1.888,0.6049,1.4258,0.0043,0.6692,4.1287,1.2342,1.0587,0.1461,0.4197,0.4366,0.0002,3.532,4.4486,1.4295,0.0003,0.1622,1.4107,3.4772,3.7323,2.0396,0.4033,1.0531,0.4607,4.2926,5.0808,0.0054,0.0536,0.0216,0.6505,0.9539,4.6139,4.6789,1.4697,2.691,1.0986,0.9377,1.4317,0.406,0.125,3.1983,2.3089,2.3395,3.941,0.0478,3.3128,0.6409,0.274,0.0002,2.3151,1.7136,2.5522,0.8432,2.9672,2.9539,3.5165,0.5841,0.1742,2.6924,2.9228,3.6633,2.6436,5.2234,2.5538,2.9214,1.6639,0.0807,0.7228,2.3494,1.8001,0.2887,0.837,4.1884,0.2687]}

Many people are against me and those that follow, and that's their right.\n\nThis wasn't done on purpose, but after I began harassing people without reason, after I started to attack people over seemingly nothing, it became very clear that I wanted to cause pain and harm to my fellow members here, and to myself. As we all know, the truth is that one shouldn't attack members of the group because they disagree with you, since that is wrong. Not only the fact that they don't agree with you, but also because it is wrong.\n\nBut the truth is, even if some people hate me and my intentions can't change them, some hate me and think I'm doing nothing wrong, and there are many people here who think I'm a really nice guy.\n\nAnd so I'm sorry for what I did. I know it hurt and I know it's not right.

You are going to call in the military to find him out. The military finds them out because he is lying about his age. That should never happen to you, and that's why I am a vet. I have done things with my life that make me proud. I have served my country and I have put my life on the line for the good of our country. No matter what happens to me, no matter who I do or have done anything to, you will never find that I am self-centered. I am never going to lie to you or betray you, and I will tell you what I want you to know about me, not what you want me to say. I will do everything in my power to keep the truth about my service a secret, and your parents, your friends, your co-workers and everyone else I have ever crossed will have the same opportunity to have their lives changed by the positive influence I have in their lives. A good person can change a world. A great person can change the world. A great person can change the future of a nation. A great person can change your life completely. A great person can change your life, which will change the lives of people around you forever. A great person can put their life on the line for this country. This is something every single life matters and that is why you must be proud, no matter what happens to any one of you. I hope this helps. I guess it can be a little embarrassing, but you must know that you are my hero and I am the best thing that has happened to you in your life. I won't let anything stop you from achieving your goals in life, which is why I am a veteran.

{"id":4515,"ended":true,"length":358,"gen_text":"`` On our first date, we went to heaven. ''\n\n'''\n\n\nThis is similar to the first rule, except that it doesn't say 'we waited' - it says 'this is the way it was'.\n\n\nThe rule:\n\n\n'''On your first date, you went to heaven. [You] waited [until] the end.\n\n'''\n\n\nThis is different because waiting is not used.\n\n\nThe rule:\n\n\n'''On your first date you went to heaven. [You] waited [until] the end. [You] waited [for] the second date... [You] waited for your wedding anniversary... [You] waited [for] another baby... [You] waited [until] the end.\n\n'''\n\n\nThis rule is slightly more complicated. As far as I can tell, it's the same as the second rule. But the wording is slightly different. 'Went to heaven' is used in the first sentence, whereas waiting is not in the second sentence. Also, the grammar does differ from that of the earlier rule.\n\n\nFinally, the rule:\n\n\n'''On your first date (took you forever to get there), you went to heaven.

When the graveyard closed, locals kept it as a memorial to the few who were buried underneath and to the children who didn't live to see the site's restoration.\n\nThe museum exhibits give visitors a closer look at the interring that took place in the cemetery.

It's not uncommon for people who share the same religion to be together in the small chapel.\n\nLast winter, the chapel served as the site of a funeral, which was so long that the people started to think it would be a good idea to just shut the church until the funeral was over.\n\n\"At least the funeral had a bit of time to happen. The people in line had enough time to stop waiting and enjoy the experience like we do at Christ Church,\" Reit said. \"It's not necessary to have a funeral.\"\n\nStill, people continue to attend funerals in this part of the cemetery at Easter, when the souls of their loved ones come back to earth.\n\n\"I do think there's a place for a funeral chapel here,\" Reit said. \"There will always be somebody.

{"id":1642,"ended":true,"length":374,"gen_text":"Everyone is destined to first meet their soul-mate at age 18. You are 17, however, you have already been with the love of your life for three years now. So where do you go from there?\n\nAnswer: You need to date men who are in their 40s. Remember that marriage should never be the answer for everyone to finding their soul mate. Your family and friends are your main focus.\n\nAnother reason for you age should be because you have a job.\n\nIt is a fact that people have careers, so if you are not married, you must have already found your soul mate. The person you love has to be who you're compatible with. If you never knew him for years, you are not compatible with him. A job will be an easy way to meet people, make new friends, and hopefully date someone you will love with your life. It is amazing how many job offers can come your way if you don't have a job.\n\n4) You never go out with your date.\n\nYou have seen so many of the other girls. Do you really want to date men who don't go out? Think about it. If you never go out with anyone you meet, does that mean your life is not fulfilling?\n\nIf the answer to one of the questions above is yes then the two next question are the way to go.\n\n5) You are so interested in the relationship.\n\nDon't settle for someone who's the same as you. Do you think a girl that's as interested in the relationship you have with her, gets bored like you will?

You are 17, however, you have already been with the love of your life for three years now. So where do you go from there?\n\nAnswer: You need to date men who are in their 40s. Remember that marriage should never be the answer for everyone to finding their soul mate. Your family and friends are your main focus.\n\nAnother reason for you age should be because you have a job.\n\nIt is a fact that people have careers, so if you are not married, you must have already found your soul mate. The person you love has to be who you're compatible with. If you never knew him for years, you are not compatible with him. A job will be an easy way to meet people, make new friends, and hopefully date someone you will love with your life. It is amazing how many job offers can come your way if you don't have a job.\n\n4) You never go out with your date.\n\nYou have seen so many of the other girls. Do you really want to date men who don't go out? Think about it. If you never go out with anyone you meet, does that mean your life is not fulfilling?\n\nIf the answer to one of the questions above is yes then the two next question are the way to go.\n\n5) You are so interested in the relationship.\n\nDon't settle for someone who's the same as you. Do you think a girl that's as interested in the relationship you have with her, gets bored like you will? Do you think that you're the only one that's interested in having a relationship with the person you're dating?\n\nYour job and lifestyle are important.

Earth is created in an attempt to create violent humans to face a new threat.\n\nHowever, in the current era, earth is on the verge of destruction by alien space travelers. In this era, humans have adopted a violent strategy to keep earth alive.\n\nIt is believed that aliens have developed an inter-dimensional rift that is capable of traveling through all realities and worlds simultaneously. This rift is used to bring a strong and powerful race of humans to earth that can fight the alien invaders. But these inter-dimensional aliens are not happy with the use of these humans. To this end, they have arranged space travelers for Earth's destruction to invade our world with an ultimate goal of creating an inter-dimensional rift connecting our world with a different universe.\n\nIt has been five hundred years since the battle against the aliens. In recent years, humanity has been struggling to win the war. One day, Earth's fate is suddenly reversed when an inter-dimensional rift appears and transports some of the aliens from the other universe. This rift allows humans in this universe to enter the other universe. As the alien invaders are unable to enter this universe, they decide to create a rift to connect humans in this universe with the alien universe.\n\nIn this setting, the two universes are still connected by the rift but is now divided into 2 groups : The ones who go to the alien universe, the ones who stays in the other universe. The two groups do not communicate at all as they find it painful. The rift will now be the only way for humans to communicate with each other as the aliens will be unable to talk with humans as their language is different from humans.\n\nWe live in this world but we know there is another existence out there which have not exist since the beginning of man.

Now I am compelled to declare before all nations that America is now in a state of Martial Law. This state of martial law is in the process of being proclaimed. The Executive Branch of the Federal Government, who were either the ones who declared martial law or were merely obeyed by the American people with complete impunity, are imposing Martial Law on America. I do not know what \" Martial Law \" can be in the American people's eyes, nor where the martial law will take place but I do know that it will be declared. We will be under Martial Law and there will be no place to hide. Just like the day Hitler said the Jews won... This day America is not going to escape from this. This will become so commonplace in America that the average person won't even be shocked by it... they will accept it because the public will not dare object to it. The American people will never question the legality of what is occurring. In fact,.most will look the other way. This is the reason we were given this country and we should not question this... If that isn't clear enough... Then ask yourself this: would you accept it if it was declared that you were an enemy of America if you did anything that caused harm to a Americans?

'' `` Well, that's their problem not yours. When you have done your job, we will make you understand.'' `` Ok, I am ready. Where to?'' The alien leader grabbed Sir, and dragged us through a large metal door, into a metal hallway. The corridor opened into a large hall with two large doors on each side of the hall. Behind one of the doors, was a large metal doors with a window. A metallic hand gestured for us to walk through the door. \"Ok, I can see you have arrived in our citadel, where the humans live. But why do you want to see us? Where is the planet we live on?'' `` We live in a big spaceship, where we have been living some 20 000 years. We have come here to meet the humans in peace, we want them to give us their technology, and to stop killing one another. But we know that your ship is very powerful, we can not hope to compete against the aliens in your technology, which is so advanced. So we will help you, and give you what you need so that you can go home and live with your people. And when you are finished with us, we will do the same for the other alien leaders. That's it.''
