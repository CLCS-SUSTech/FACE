Transphobia is pervasive in our public life in America and the world, and this is partly because of the lack of transgender representation in the media. We have been conditioned to accept the idea that all people who were born a certain way are inherently evil or mentally ill. That is why the news of a trans woman who had been bullied for her sexuality shocked people. The response to the character shows what can be done to create a safe space for this community, and provides a lesson to other creators to write trans characters and portray them well.","token_len":202,"entropy":[9.1456,1.6395,4.3974,6.1995,6.2821,3.1138,2.4416,1.2171,6.0975,0.0167,1.4654,3.5382,2.8034,3.7563,10.3291,0.1613,4.1077,5.445,5.1024,2.9515,9.0247,1.7086,5.4921,5.0499,13.4407,3.6481,6.8669,2.9963,0.0005,0.0001,0.0007,5.3274,7.2937,7.9677,2.8305,1.3692,1.5105,2.51,1.7237,0.0225,3.7026,1.0848,2.2831,2.0681,1.8354,6.0997,0.2571,0.1735,1.2819,2.8817,4.8813,2.811,0.575,1.7197,1.768,5.8526,3.1773,0.0902,0.0033,2.8622,2.8349,1.1844,5.262,2.2343,4.0298,5.7119,5.0524,2.8091,0.3272,3.1773,0.9249,0.0879,0.6518,5.0414,0.0345,4.3376,5.43,2.2242,2.3385,5.0849,3.2078,2.0258,0.352,1.9539,2.3694,5.4115,1.2698,0.9866,5.3923,0.0747,1.782,2.1373,2.4683,4.5977,2.465,0.2346,1.2983,4.3668,0.573,2.1522,6.6381,2.8364,3.7577,2.8292,1.634,2.4164,2.4602,1.5304,0.6419,3.0808,1.9023,6.2307,1.8135,1.0636,0.6169,2.5322,0.0053,4.372,0.8907,0.3394,1.9161,0.3055,0.3563,4.254,2.2876,3.2935,4.0726,0.2324,3.2888,1.2248,1.3029,0.1557,3.188,2.199,3.2003,4.1295,0.2161,3.606,0.4168,0.2034,0.2712,3.3046,2.3048,2.6688,5.2039,0.2333,0.8496,4.0156,1.4076,2.0692,1.919,5.2965,1.3517,2.0721,1.7502,0.5516,3.0688,2.7828,1.5654,5.115,1.9803,1.5149,3.3741,5.9037,2.6101,1.0324,2.3725,4.7654,1.0,1.1357,3.4307,6.1237,4.3726,1.7345,1.8587,0.9093,2.4627,2.9728,1.0956,4.8793,1.6501,0.1321,4.9404,1.9117,1.9874,0.8925,5.6672,1.247,3.1338,1.683,2.2529,1.0218,2.4467,5.8128,2.771,0.1972,3.0454,1.9997,0.3767,2.567,0.1358]}

Architect Luthar, architect and designer of buildings including the White House in Washington DC, was also an early practitioner of an aperiodic tiling design.","token_len":204,"entropy":[6.5712,0.2671,0.9186,0.1992,0.0514,0.773,4.3697,0.0158,0.1067,0.229,8.9021,9.0289,5.4485,1.9938,0.0015,5.6267,2.1986,0.9279,1.2176,5.0646,2.6711,0.0143,5.6383,0.1732,1.408,9.7417,0.4066,0.4147,4.1304,2.222,3.4561,6.9878,1.6196,4.3049,9.6893,0.5575,0.3745,3.4146,0.577,2.9178,6.9225,0.2495,3.3377,3.3369,3.6953,3.6963,4.466,0.1979,3.4816,4.7518,3.7012,6.4811,2.2101,2.8755,1.1685,2.2341,0.1253,1.7308,1.8134,1.2184,3.3215,3.872,4.0296,0.004,0.7777,5.6458,3.8465,5.7382,0.9063,3.8723,1.2491,0.0005,1.4033,2.013,0.0051,5.4617,3.3942,4.1624,2.0514,6.0486,0.0462,0.0009,4.3986,1.9828,2.3615,5.2196,3.2806,1.1688,0.011,0.1884,2.0141,1.1037,2.1795,0.3147,0.5321,2.6472,0.0198,5.3527,0.6992,0.9664,2.5551,4.7518,0.0588,3.04,1.3185,4.1325,0.601,0.0039,0.0442,1.4523,3.9561,3.5712,0.6287,0.77,0.0338,5.9752,3.7064,0.3158,0.6979,0.0002,2.2299,3.6652,4.7717,4.2703,1.3813,0.4881,0.7583,3.7385,0.0648,1.5977,0.0056,0.0002,3.6023,1.2452,1.586,2.8801,1.6232,3.4619,3.6528,2.8877,3.8829,0.7964,1.3207,0.0002,3.503,3.9259,0.0284,1.0761,0.0143,4.2052,6.3774,3.4605,1.391,2.0996,0.0199,2.9473,1.1874,3.4324,4.1139,2.1408,4.8798,1.4644,3.849,1.1272,1.1472,3.6668,1.7605,0.5847,4.1154,5.1205,0.7725,4.2871,6.0892,4.9431,2.3148,3.9705,4.3414,1.5265,1.0494,0.9067,4.5006,3.743,0.4641,5.2059,1.179,1.4655,0.1168,1.8528,0.2996,3.1157,3.3921,1.9689,2.2032,2.4314,0.1184,2.7643,0.6131,0.0012,0.0029,0.3646,0.0234,1.7731,0.4621]}

{"id":3177,"ended":true,"length":186,"gen_text":"Vollmer unveiled Close Castles in June 2014. Players start in corners of a `` grid map `` and are represented by castles. Vollmer explained that the game's name is from castles built next to each other that are closed off to those in adjacent cells. The grid represents the space in which play is taking place. Play continues across those spaces until a king falls in the `` play space `', and the `` king ends up on the same cell as the castle that produced it. If the player is occupying a cell that is on the borders of four or more castles, that player will advance to the next turn.

One can only imagine the reaction in the industry if some other R&B artist, for example, had debuted a track with a rating of 4.0 on Metacritic that month.","token_len":208,"entropy":[6.4386,0.2337,13.1593,16.657,6.2482,0.0738,2.5923,1.2429,2.3634,0.0587,3.0984,2.3452,0.2913,3.9808,0.1454,2.9594,0.0861,0.5003,3.7271,5.9834,0.0016,2.5783,1.3991,0.0461,2.0434,6.2868,12.8163,0.6169,0.0182,2.7265,4.3861,1.2761,0.5009,3.4505,1.2494,3.0277,1.886,1.7847,0.4661,6.4182,0.0762,0.0775,2.78,2.0882,0.0115,0.496,0.0798,1.416,0.0263,0.0407,1.2479,1.4994,0.4437,5.2717,0.041,2.4011,0.6288,0.051,0.0041,0.3744,7.5894,6.9242,4.1404,0.0879,0.9066,0.598,1.7487,0.3164,0.1494,0.0265,6.6228,0.0671,0.0018,0.3525,0.9802,6.0383,1.4401,5.3071,1.4789,4.6193,1.4334,0.1626,0.0072,3.9771,5.0435,3.2447,2.2559,0.9455,2.7473,4.4143,2.0499,3.5988,1.6871,4.7731,4.0778,2.0803,2.4366,1.6439,2.8801,5.122,1.0719,5.2103,0.2818,2.0096,0.3087,3.7972,0.0282,0.1986,0.7299,0.3021,2.6561,0.0858,4.3889,0.018,1.4119,1.764,2.8061,1.6749,1.2432,2.9428,0.5805,2.1077,3.1127,1.5525,1.0307,0.2366,1.9838,4.2625,3.9379,1.6315,0.4641,0.778,0.3311,0.6714,6.0547,1.6723,4.3688,0.8876,0.6134,0.0529,0.3306,4.3056,5.6489,4.6242,0.9547,5.2575,1.3281,0.353,1.3212,1.9061,6.5644,2.1043,4.2745,0.2339,2.4161,5.4232,0.8791,5.4487,0.0007,0.0033,1.6308,2.4639,5.5638,4.6683,3.8056,0.7549,0.0075,0.6204,0.7255,5.8295,4.0186,1.5823,0.7546,1.2571,3.118,4.111,0.6835,3.6515,1.2877,6.5463,2.141,4.7813,0.1371,0.0012,0.6809,2.9437,3.2079,0.2893,0.1213,2.4159,5.2851,1.6412,1.6827,1.2336,1.5419,3.1752,0.5718,0.711,0.0538,0.22,1.7499,0.314,0.0024,0.0107,4.2918,4.6814,0.2952]}

The song appears in more shows with the band than any other track, as it has received two videos in its eleven year history: the first, released in 2007, and the second, released on 14 February 2014.","token_len":210,"entropy":[8.0865,3.4237,1.0546,11.1322,11.8596,6.126,0.5768,0.0267,2.8944,1.8818,1.8421,6.7614,0.9762,1.506,0.8076,0.3206,1.6869,12.0892,0.0522,6.3652,3.0186,13.3132,0.5014,6.4072,0.0426,1.7601,1.4201,5.0288,0.1751,1.4151,3.2149,0.0379,5.5548,2.1273,6.2578,7.8704,0.2988,0.1881,4.1089,4.9024,0.1686,5.128,2.0934,3.5086,5.1541,0.4451,5.9341,1.1997,0.2216,1.6352,2.7951,1.0437,1.1522,0.4707,5.3562,1.9218,0.9493,0.0756,0.436,4.1698,2.3741,0.0042,1.655,0.0016,0.0005,0.0166,4.4009,4.3198,3.774,4.1128,4.4596,4.114,4.3571,4.346,3.852,4.331,2.4288,6.6102,1.3493,1.9094,2.563,0.976,5.316,4.6386,0.4303,5.2926,3.9659,2.465,7.6422,5.3266,1.0236,0.4755,4.5429,2.2001,0.0921,1.6777,2.8419,1.91,1.6421,2.1172,1.2636,0.5455,1.9277,2.1615,2.7097,3.1562,0.5791,1.7532,0.722,0.4265,4.3551,0.0759,1.127,0.032,0.165,2.827,4.9931,1.8564,2.4332,1.9476,3.0364,4.2455,3.1301,1.9383,0.7373,3.7898,0.9488,0.9263,0.6304,5.2622,3.457,0.6523,1.1823,2.6489,0.5188,3.251,2.0133,1.1164,2.5017,0.0067,2.3693,0.7027,0.5439,1.5569,4.5268,0.033,0.5722,0.3257,0.797,0.8792,1.5542,0.4315,3.1616,4.4888,1.8707,0.2332,1.8138,0.3413,2.7622,0.0554,4.9769,0.0049,0.7898,3.8248,1.8027,1.2069,1.0522,2.1428,3.0296,1.3457,6.6689,7.0132,3.291,0.8174,0.662,1.3835,0.9346,0.1063,1.608,1.196,3.2784,1.715,1.8745,5.2816,3.1852,5.2321,2.5299,2.4441,4.3254,1.4092,1.2983,2.2483,1.5684,0.8885,2.4086,3.2861,1.1814,2.9059,0.2555,1.0606,0.115,0.1749,0.127,0.2798,2.2598,3.8078,2.0047,2.8711,0.6524]}

Despite being extremely good technical players with a strong live show, the band's songs have a dark, post-hardcore vibe and are generally not as well-received as their more mainstream contemporaries.","token_len":215,"entropy":[2.9868,4.4787,1.9425,1.7473,5.5595,3.6337,0.1385,0.2215,9.209,13.6698,10.1413,6.7823,11.6741,4.3687,7.227,6.7943,9.6096,1.6943,3.8123,8.8053,0.5149,0.0002,0.0035,1.7744,1.7242,2.4543,3.4083,1.8847,3.5016,1.9859,0.9023,0.3477,5.1664,0.0062,0.8526,0.0003,5.3912,3.644,2.096,0.3262,0.9421,5.0474,0.195,1.1159,0.9011,0.9621,3.0426,0.9363,4.2485,0.3063,0.5643,3.3545,0.7622,0.2558,1.4284,0.7391,5.1393,0.0114,0.0417,1.2666,6.2943,1.3959,5.2743,5.2654,2.6488,3.3271,0.8659,3.727,0.4226,0.8754,2.3225,0.0034,1.5477,0.0031,0.0203,0.0006,4.0314,2.3409,4.3687,2.7546,0.6077,1.3188,2.3514,0.9715,2.0288,2.6378,2.3587,2.2739,1.9812,0.1137,0.0012,0.5192,1.986,2.64,6.1308,0.4106,0.0971,0.1413,0.3271,4.0135,1.3357,0.4365,1.1474,2.3074,1.4815,4.7043,0.0054,5.7047,1.5079,3.6626,3.4714,1.8032,1.4599,6.1848,4.4207,2.5968,1.7601,3.4489,5.2628,1.2973,0.2666,1.04,0.5897,1.2159,0.0002,1.6495,0.0031,0.016,0.0004,1.9122,3.848,0.1826,2.2247,6.5676,0.1003,1.6339,0.8536,5.0873,1.3228,3.9593,2.3525,3.0108,1.768,0.4572,0.0957,0.1546,1.4643,0.002,5.9164,4.3458,1.2869,0.0115,0.065,1.0028,1.7008,1.2479,7.0661,2.2948,3.3066,3.2851,1.9526,1.3292,1.8597,2.7718,3.6216,1.4514,0.4808,1.4339,0.9653,2.8004,0.8388,0.0283,2.6962,0.3411,0.8928,6.0535,3.2577,4.729,6.1554,7.7042,1.9127,4.2959,1.3709,1.6926,1.6247,0.6239,0.1197,2.0597,0.3243,2.0731,3.4489,1.8856,2.2011,3.4065,0.939,4.9168,0.0604,0.6916,0.0003,2.6971,2.3882,1.5481,2.5832,2.6062,2.8223,2.834,0.7334,1.1069,1.4054,1.3481,1.5122,2.1951,1.2655,0.2359]}

{"id":2604,"ended":true,"length":201,"gen_text":"Before the influx of automobiles, Spokane's electric streetcar and interurban lines played a dominant role in moving people and goods around Spokane. Streetcars were installed as early as 1888, when they carried Spokane's first streetcar passengers. The first vehicle on the Spokane interurban system arrived in 1896. In 1907, the first electrified light rail system opened, and the first electric streetcar line was completed in 1908. By then, Spokane was already well-known for its streetcar service, and its electric streetcars became increasingly used in the interurban service, replacing steam passenger cars. Spokane's rapid growth, and the rapid growth of its interurban system, forced the city to rapidly add more electric streetcar lines. The interurban system came to Spokane at a time when Spokane was experiencing a rapid growth, and Spokane's electric streetcars had become popular with a large number of people. Although the interurban line in Spokane provided many benefits, including easy and convenient interurban transportation for some, it also led Spokane's population to become denser than in the earlier period, thereby increasing urban sprawl.","token_len":216,"entropy":[1.7125,9.1819,0.1174,9.2924,0.6869,9.1761,2.1461,8.0527,1.2006,4.876,4.6962,0.0523,2.2577,7.0891,0.4604,5.741,0.0266,0.147,4.8015,0.4333,1.4106,0.3231,2.4017,2.9136,0.4698,6.9633,0.165,1.6527,5.7266,3.9761,0.0984,0.0023,3.5197,0.9964,3.2269,3.0241,3.4083,2.746,0.4806,0.187,2.9165,1.3621,0.6742,1.7756,1.5733,6.6668,2.6527,0.5569,0.514,2.9934,0.0276,0.8579,3.2335,0.1623,3.3425,1.0184,2.6331,3.0622,0.3161,1.1602,2.1641,3.4692,0.7026,5.1305,0.2782,1.2163,3.1579,1.6889,2.226,2.1501,1.11,1.2183,1.1198,2.0567,1.4379,2.5308,0.2688,1.5956,0.1126,2.9834,4.3592,0.154,0.5557,1.8078,3.3619,1.8781,1.3339,0.3778,0.7633,0.204,2.5156,2.3684,1.0929,0.7692,3.3678,1.9707,2.5658,0.0359,2.6344,4.6092,4.5384,2.5383,1.0892,3.5061,0.1644,2.0882,2.3156,4.2736,2.0697,6.0755,0.4985,0.7883,3.5952,0.6746,4.4106,0.5398,2.7613,2.6547,0.6162,2.9244,1.3492,0.0816,2.3944,1.4786,0.0447,1.3902,0.1655,4.4543,0.5618,1.4109,0.1818,5.2866,3.5187,2.2127,1.9473,1.7466,0.2584,0.9272,2.2325,2.8139,0.0349,0.7968,5.5779,0.5123,0.8472,3.7466,0.6157,0.1329,0.1575,1.4066,1.2623,2.3936,1.1292,1.7759,1.1777,3.1176,0.9088,2.2126,0.9993,2.2524,0.8893,0.0224,4.7506,0.8033,3.4783,1.83,4.6767,2.0057,1.2317,0.0034,1.3064,0.4943,5.0081,1.4381,1.5975,0.019,3.5841,3.7577,0.1951,5.6037,3.7157,1.8238,1.1189,2.0892,5.615,2.5394,2.3487,3.2035,0.4031,2.0574,2.3355,5.4138,1.1485,1.2382,0.6988,3.4716,5.457,2.267,2.8352,0.4846,2.8648,4.748,0.0036,2.3311,2.9225,2.2773,3.5613,2.9175,1.7715,5.7199,1.659,4.2093,0.7815,0.0001,0.4069]}

The serialisation was accompanied with illustrations by James Grieve, Charles Fox, and Francis Toulmin. The story was reprinted in Graphic in June 1887. A second edition of this serial has been published in the first major English translation as part of the Complete Stories series, and is entitled The Man With the Yellow Eyes.\n\nThe earliest extant book to have been published in the name of this story is The Man With the Yellow Eyes, but no significant further edition was issued after this. The story continued to feature in The Lark Inn Stories, but the volume contained no additional material. A new edition of The Story of the Dog, published in 1912, is the first serious English translation of the story. Despite considerable effort to find earlier editions, the story has remained little-known outside its original geographic area; the first edition itself and the most representative editions of it are, however, available in England and the United States.","token_len":217,"entropy":[2.4134,6.6777,5.2219,2.831,0.9805,1.9411,4.5782,0.272,1.3709,8.9737,5.4461,1.5222,8.1762,9.9142,0.001,2.2444,5.3549,3.7276,1.0829,3.0207,1.8114,3.764,4.0107,5.6842,0.0486,2.2325,0.487,0.031,0.2797,1.5122,2.3188,5.0732,0.9712,4.2575,3.9793,2.8192,0.5521,4.2932,2.6712,2.8757,1.1881,5.6426,4.9141,0.8506,0.8986,4.912,4.6154,3.0474,0.0653,0.5227,1.3527,1.4107,0.7595,2.1293,0.4413,5.8559,1.5278,3.5465,0.8565,0.0316,1.5183,3.8354,1.4863,1.1402,1.3712,3.0252,2.4108,5.7703,0.8284,0.7406,1.0187,2.0036,4.0876,6.3962,1.0529,1.5048,4.0332,4.2493,0.0038,0.5572,4.4264,1.2058,2.011,1.5256,3.0473,1.9458,4.5567,1.0823,4.1556,3.0753,0.7424,3.416,0.9706,0.5004,0.8637,0.0081,1.4367,5.5725,3.4958,5.6931,4.1431,3.4143,0.6332,1.0225,0.9175,1.2703,4.3867,0.1542,2.6271,1.2778,0.3431,1.6517,1.3196,0.394,0.1032,0.0186,0.0474,1.1117,5.1009,4.0638,5.3798,5.0001,3.256,1.787,2.978,3.6993,1.8024,0.838,1.5655,1.0161,4.1389,0.0856,4.4842,0.3076,4.1991,6.1963,4.5814,5.0524,4.6755,0.797,3.5926,2.0272,3.3439,5.1318,1.0179,2.5547,1.2677,1.3121,2.9944,3.1177,0.5769,0.6051,1.2017,5.3048,0.103,0.5517,5.692,2.0035,1.5781,0.2074,4.752,0.2031,2.8504,0.9313,1.4508,5.0444,2.0594,1.0011,0.528,0.6319,0.3031,0.9261,6.7714,5.7495,2.7025,2.5269,2.9477,4.4152,0.9039,0.6741,1.69,1.5787,1.0183,2.4588,4.2308,2.503,0.0706,1.5788,2.8416,1.0955,5.7098,1.1952,4.3293,2.0442,2.4502,2.1526,6.003,6.6659,0.8739,3.329,5.9509,2.8355,1.4983,3.1702,1.604,5.3467,1.5395,0.0022,2.5581,0.6646,6.1592,1.6003,1.2834,0.7722,0.0051,0.1785]}

These streets are labeled with a number.\n\nHere is a street grid that is approximately centered on Washington Square Garden, an elegant landmark in the heart of the city, and the largest public space in the nation, with over 4.5 million square feet available for gatherings and events.","token_len":218,"entropy":[7.9487,3.077,7.3293,8.2223,1.7379,5.1189,2.3962,1.9767,1.4538,5.6914,2.2775,1.1592,6.191,0.1822,0.2136,11.0638,8.318,0.9937,1.5163,2.3163,6.8997,0.1185,5.0329,1.0138,5.5029,1.2578,5.3412,0.9186,1.1749,0.1334,0.1125,0.1103,0.0097,0.524,0.4983,0.2249,0.0122,0.7673,0.0962,4.3592,2.6167,1.4656,6.1566,5.3246,2.9968,0.2956,0.3247,4.7888,1.5004,1.9774,3.9973,3.1745,5.216,5.3367,0.2307,5.1841,2.372,0.899,4.1289,0.0033,0.5422,0.6201,4.0194,0.0019,0.0,1.5909,0.8879,0.0004,0.0001,3.9465,1.5046,2.7413,0.4473,3.1513,1.0558,0.8156,0.0026,6.3425,1.001,4.7278,1.1453,2.3946,1.4851,0.004,0.568,2.0183,5.8644,1.2433,5.0725,0.7608,0.7955,2.3511,3.7646,0.1601,1.9582,5.5545,0.3673,4.9496,2.7174,1.6438,1.3673,0.0102,5.1887,2.6356,0.8484,3.5684,4.8498,0.7569,2.8391,5.4959,3.2043,1.446,2.1095,0.9252,5.0351,0.8209,0.2537,0.4586,2.026,0.0002,3.9309,3.5963,0.6857,0.3742,3.8298,3.6602,3.5305,2.2809,1.3124,2.2793,4.9945,0.0653,1.3302,0.7011,6.167,2.3005,0.6322,1.7736,0.8497,5.8732,2.0713,3.2866,0.9098,2.9068,3.0766,0.4057,6.0175,5.3535,5.0623,0.5379,2.1635,6.9921,0.8274,4.4473,0.715,0.1233,0.5732,5.0584,2.2227,0.2499,3.742,1.4089,0.5187,4.4893,1.7165,1.7227,1.2362,2.0065,1.142,0.0002,4.2055,0.9632,0.5081,1.933,0.2197,2.8747,1.9215,4.8241,4.3139,0.513,5.0295,1.4813,7.0949,1.9208,4.5614,5.5779,4.2886,0.812,1.1223,0.5814,0.0019,1.667,0.3828,2.8063,1.8498,2.6017,2.341,1.0094,0.498,0.0713,0.2775,1.2711,2.8194,1.1356,2.764,3.6497,1.5378,0.656,0.1464,0.355,0.0086,5.8501,0.3731,6.5787,1.5755,0.6215,0.2798]}

During the 1950s and 60s, the Conservatives were largely successful at maintaining a government agenda in the face of intense liberalization.\n\nThe Liberals and New Democrats were also in the middle of a liberalization movement, but with two major differences: one was that the liberals were largely united around the slogan \"Change That We Can Believe In,\" while the New Democrats tended to use slogans such as \"A Canada We Can Trust,\" \"One Canada, One Labour,\" and \"A Fair Shot for All.\"\n\nIn recent years, both the Liberals and New Democrats have suffered from low voter turnout, and there have been a number of minority governments.\n\nElections","token_len":219,"entropy":[8.8847,3.9744,7.1284,9.0959,3.663,4.2285,8.521,0.9382,0.0801,0.0104,0.0017,0.9601,0.9446,3.1033,1.6959,2.799,0.9617,5.1304,1.1462,2.1528,1.612,1.7898,1.8439,6.0246,6.8146,0.4756,4.2597,0.004,0.4493,1.2776,0.8711,1.1898,2.3258,2.106,0.3534,2.5106,1.2451,5.2274,0.1346,3.3446,3.102,0.8734,0.0234,0.2856,2.3095,3.8137,1.9294,2.1102,0.3874,3.9427,4.1159,4.4434,3.6638,0.4356,2.4621,0.4317,0.6295,0.0018,5.078,0.6895,3.4443,0.0659,0.6322,2.2341,1.3889,1.646,0.4472,4.1898,0.2429,0.8152,1.9324,3.309,4.7968,0.7026,4.8479,2.7056,5.3048,0.5354,1.3762,2.3258,0.9147,0.5801,1.2911,0.9345,4.2913,0.3311,2.5859,0.0322,1.2941,3.0479,0.0012,0.1183,0.6933,0.9415,2.2238,4.8084,2.0199,2.3554,2.8181,2.0989,3.3686,5.5954,3.1202,1.3922,0.4661,0.0023,4.0155,5.0958,4.0965,1.4025,1.6276,0.0002,1.4366,2.1165,2.6792,1.6768,0.0798,2.1476,3.1163,3.5676,2.3648,3.3504,0.0699,1.0922,3.1866,0.3239,2.2639,1.1631,1.0388,3.4742,4.7471,1.8442,0.3371,1.4033,2.812,1.1738,1.1207,0.5927,3.2808,1.0402,4.5004,4.4801,1.9149,1.0203,4.8353,0.9644,5.2051,4.8379,1.2819,0.0342,0.0066,0.0612,0.3971,0.7179,0.1281,0.6709,0.024,4.3326,0.0849,4.4506,3.9532,1.6079,0.0038,0.0284,2.1544,3.9494,2.0539,0.0545,4.1531,1.7897,1.0919,4.2158,1.2919,0.3621,0.6314,4.6964,0.7811,0.4451,0.1424,1.9403,3.3271,3.6873,0.3395,0.351,0.1235,0.8273,0.0002,2.2482,5.2734,0.6527,0.0833,3.1391,0.8805,0.6095,0.0167,0.5275,0.005,0.1719,5.1001,0.9664,4.3295,1.2003,0.3807,1.1841,1.3835,5.2027,2.0534,0.1123,3.029,0.3502,0.0036,4.2998,0.0801,1.2101,1.6263,0.0002,5.5628,1.0604]}

{"id":2925,"ended":true,"length":190,"gen_text":"Translation is the process by which a mature mRNA molecule is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell's mRNA translation machinery. During translation, mRNA polymerase binds the mRNA to form a complex that subsequently binds to the mRNA-binding protein Rps20, a protein that carries out translation.\n\n. Transcription is the process of translating genes into RNA and thus the cell.\n\nThe mRNA translational machinery is composed of three steps. 1. The mRNA is cleaved into two small strands that have a double helix structure (called A1 and A2) and attached to RNA polymerase for translational initiation into the E. coli ribosome. 2. Mutation of the A1 strand leads to loss of the mRNA while maturation of the A2 strand results in the conversion of the mutated strand into new RNA molecules. 3. The new RNA molecules are transcribed, and their encoded proteins are packaged and released onto the ribosome.","token_len":220,"entropy":[4.5376,2.7229,2.0714,2.1805,0.0019,1.3985,10.55,9.2116,4.105,0.867,5.0253,2.1328,0.4858,0.0785,0.6543,4.8446,0.087,0.7114,1.8865,1.9551,0.6718,3.2587,1.0552,3.7774,0.0077,0.479,2.0685,0.2593,0.1842,0.572,5.0289,3.1633,0.1185,1.9917,2.6454,0.6408,6.8391,0.0028,1.0471,1.07,0.1412,1.2943,2.6474,0.9396,0.5722,3.573,5.3393,4.8118,0.8653,0.1239,4.4261,0.2709,0.1568,1.9867,5.4954,1.5674,2.6648,1.5846,0.7429,1.7075,4.5568,0.4802,1.8266,1.9496,5.157,2.8914,1.5211,1.0699,1.5988,1.8295,0.6431,0.8524,5.3765,4.2953,4.2532,1.5923,3.2938,2.0586,0.8242,5.0295,0.6904,1.9209,0.7565,1.5412,0.0006,8.2733,5.4636,0.2317,0.6648,0.1696,0.1941,4.6,2.3086,3.4635,0.3965,2.0981,1.8101,6.5231,3.1612,4.1954,2.9497,2.8282,0.0001,3.1331,3.5729,4.9248,0.6675,0.1672,1.2446,2.2089,0.0233,1.8991,4.9124,1.8784,5.6362,1.0818,1.8281,0.655,1.248,3.8558,0.008,1.2691,1.6295,4.2949,3.4974,3.1105,5.0564,1.7676,4.458,1.1355,0.1033,0.9284,2.6046,2.4414,3.6719,5.2425,0.4492,0.0632,0.037,1.3921,1.1184,5.5058,0.1011,4.6629,0.6329,0.015,5.6827,3.8542,0.0294,1.9165,6.1383,0.4917,5.4035,0.7205,0.249,0.9376,0.0038,0.0963,0.2556,0.3931,0.0042,5.0831,4.0075,0.4083,0.73,1.2923,0.3389,1.7031,2.6423,0.0137,3.4437,0.0222,1.5913,2.095,6.3907,4.6171,0.6121,0.0646,0.2047,0.0967,0.0105,0.0551,2.0305,0.0043,1.5066,4.5421,0.1096,0.4814,5.7088,0.9686,0.672,5.2219,2.6623,2.8696,0.7907,0.3387,0.003,0.9916,2.3496,0.6511,0.2985,0.2566,3.7812,0.001,4.219,2.7718,2.8222,5.3377,1.1624,0.1184,3.4544,2.8355,2.8551,5.8501,0.1021,1.0802,0.0038,0.0983,0.9076]}

About 99 % of a mammal's mass is made up of elements in the periodic table. The major group of these elements is the carbon group because of its ubiquitous presence in the environment. Carbon is essential to life, and to humans the carbon skeleton (skeleton without hair) is used as a food source. About 60 % of all carbon elements and 80 % of hydrogen (and helium, and most of carbon's heavier cousins) is used as energy by living things in the form of ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ). The remaining ten percent of carbon is largely stored as minerals ( e.g. chlorophyll with a carbon atom on each oxygen carbon atom), or as organic molecules. As a carbon atom is turned into another carbon atom in the living cells of any organism, an exchange between the two new atoms is required, otherwise the new carbon can be broken down, and there is no longer energy to be taken from the second carbon.","token_len":220,"entropy":[9.0806,5.3686,5.6386,5.5579,0.068,0.0783,6.6634,10.2892,5.1422,1.3487,5.1566,3.8541,8.5085,0.0307,0.0278,0.2964,5.3928,2.0105,0.3087,2.3508,1.5177,0.0707,9.087,4.9407,6.6451,1.2377,2.4438,6.9992,3.7754,2.7102,0.045,5.1569,4.8342,0.0984,3.6539,0.3097,1.1668,0.2679,0.0318,4.6085,2.8016,0.4827,1.357,0.017,1.2518,1.9119,4.4432,4.22,0.6038,2.413,0.6771,0.8127,0.5261,3.9866,1.7246,6.0068,1.7447,0.5566,4.3472,0.921,0.3713,1.2909,2.7987,0.6674,1.8433,1.2339,3.7747,1.7418,0.8227,1.9824,1.7388,4.9627,4.5822,2.9976,1.1646,3.9311,2.9317,3.8643,0.2275,3.1026,4.133,0.3637,0.5722,3.5204,1.323,0.5046,5.3305,0.292,0.6523,3.9302,4.0781,0.0635,0.0232,2.8124,0.8427,4.6616,4.5957,4.1915,0.0337,0.0082,5.0662,2.6465,4.9581,2.852,3.8795,2.6322,3.3624,1.1437,6.5133,1.3268,1.5189,1.2027,0.2071,2.1869,3.5272,1.6753,1.111,1.5169,0.538,1.6393,3.8773,0.4886,0.9233,0.0049,1.1297,1.191,0.915,0.1597,0.0036,0.021,0.0084,0.0019,0.0061,1.3589,1.9153,1.9408,4.884,0.2551,1.184,0.3819,0.896,4.8631,3.5624,1.1752,4.3515,2.1122,4.502,0.0046,0.002,0.0321,6.4672,1.8313,0.0019,7.2403,2.6677,2.0124,0.9105,3.86,0.6952,2.4422,5.9473,0.6972,3.1359,2.8862,1.5391,2.7458,2.4266,1.9681,5.2843,1.2633,3.0606,0.7823,0.9051,3.7003,0.3083,3.0171,0.6654,0.0705,3.1978,0.9721,4.1715,2.0597,1.0359,4.3572,0.5666,0.2356,4.3096,3.1855,4.0939,0.7086,0.8224,4.7812,1.1956,1.2511,2.1887,2.4207,5.1082,0.6904,2.6214,0.8504,3.9012,1.5312,2.8796,0.3036,4.0744,1.5045,5.2994,0.5689,0.6472,3.0067,3.4998,1.2375,0.9207,4.8074,0.7559,0.4046,5.753,0.7589,0.8949]}

It is both arboreal and terrestrial, feeding in the canopy of trees and shrubs. The size of the female ranges from 3 cm (1 inch) to 6 cm (2 and half inches) in length, although larger specimens seem to occasionally be seen. The males are typically smaller, but larger individuals have been seen as well. Males are usually reddish brown and larger than the females.\n\nThe caterpillars and larvae of this species are small and resemble a flattened bean. They feed on small insects such as beetles, grasshoppers, flies, moths and cockroaches; particularly on moths and silkworms. They also parasitize ants. The larvae pupate in cocoons within the bark of tree trunks and rarely emerge while moths are in flight. One large female was seen pupating inside a tree trunk during the night, and the adult appeared about two days later, with its back completely closed up and its mouth blocked by a leaf.","token_len":221,"entropy":[12.0428,10.1612,11.3308,6.2394,7.5808,1.7386,1.9827,5.0707,1.1091,3.2178,1.4289,1.686,4.3375,5.2891,3.1511,0.068,2.8187,4.533,3.6139,1.8542,0.0161,0.4283,1.7694,1.1673,8.0799,6.573,0.0364,0.0009,0.0748,1.0974,0.6591,4.6621,3.1829,1.951,2.336,1.3598,1.1872,1.3284,1.6549,0.0334,0.7094,2.1057,5.4809,0.2767,0.8108,3.9162,3.1842,0.1214,2.5088,3.6929,2.0145,0.2599,1.6072,0.0147,0.1556,2.2024,0.1763,0.0075,0.0097,4.268,4.8121,0.0811,1.0593,0.7222,0.2708,1.2486,3.8709,3.6321,0.7662,6.7502,0.0456,5.3153,0.5717,1.5736,0.1659,1.1722,2.2712,0.4713,4.8409,1.0262,1.0123,3.1852,3.1006,2.0747,0.7341,0.1333,1.4825,3.2846,0.127,0.0615,4.2768,1.2474,2.3038,3.5286,0.001,1.4561,3.056,5.1492,0.5518,1.0271,0.0744,0.477,1.6284,0.0069,1.4682,5.2698,0.6023,0.0021,4.4694,2.4482,0.9318,1.8663,1.1178,0.6062,3.9566,1.3831,3.3957,2.552,4.7006,4.3344,1.0923,1.1591,1.72,0.3165,3.7561,1.4174,2.4346,0.0019,2.5843,0.4066,2.3075,0.002,0.0143,0.3553,3.0995,0.4765,2.0071,0.0357,0.9222,5.0452,0.007,0.0,5.1594,6.0677,0.6,4.4016,0.0129,1.1622,4.7827,0.4395,0.2393,1.9151,1.875,5.9764,0.0023,0.0813,4.0241,2.0562,1.3274,1.5756,2.5115,0.0059,0.5943,4.0755,0.008,3.586,0.5986,2.8294,0.1904,3.1809,0.3358,0.0,1.3349,5.2524,1.6114,6.4694,5.9766,0.1463,0.6045,3.6745,1.3037,0.163,6.1566,4.8379,3.4537,1.8855,1.7215,2.4721,0.0033,2.5522,0.3802,1.8856,1.0016,3.8005,1.1003,2.68,2.5889,1.2994,1.9437,3.6334,4.9594,4.0619,2.4749,1.6092,0.0388,2.7395,3.4262,2.3383,3.9438,4.3851,5.0294,2.4866,2.4039,1.6302,2.996,5.172,0.8905,0.9055,1.1025,0.1738]}

This reduces the communication between neurons and, therefore, has a calming effect.\n\nIt works in exactly the same way as benzodiazepines do, but because it is designed to work with GABA, rather than benzodiazepines, the side effects are not as severe. The effect is less sedative.\n\nAnother reason for benzodiazepines not being as effective as GABA is that the brain is very good at removing GABA, so if you take it too much, the GABA levels build up and stop the brain calming you.

{"id":4727,"ended":true,"length":187,"gen_text":"Queen Ranavalona continued the military incursions initiated under Radama I to pacify neighboring kingdoms and maintain their submission to Merina rule. These policies had a strongly negative effect on economic and population growth during the mid-seventeenth century. The population of southern Spain grew rapidly during the eighteenth century, as farmers migrated south from the north to find work.\n\nAn interesting story emerges from the story of the Spanish military invasions in the years after the expulsion of the Moors. During these years, the Spanish military government used the Moors as scapegoats for poor economic growth. However, it is interesting to ponder the fact that some of the most important leaders of the period were people who were themselves the victims of the Spanish invasion. Several of these military leaders are well known with histories such as Diego Alonso: Castillo y Coronado, Francisco Pizarro: Casanova, Joaquin de Ulloa de Erazo: Ulloa, and Pedro Argejo, who later led the conquistadors to Mexico and became the first Spaniard to capture the Inca Empire.","token_len":223,"entropy":[11.6526,9.7938,5.5216,9.2928,3.2457,7.6321,6.981,0.3505,8.0446,4.0015,7.972,5.5889,5.7608,3.5289,7.0289,0.0035,6.5605,2.5394,1.6326,5.1331,3.358,4.6918,0.9263,8.8519,5.2991,6.4152,0.2493,4.4885,6.1081,4.0404,2.2722,8.9928,1.3043,0.9509,0.0887,6.9456,2.3465,4.3623,0.4925,6.1521,0.3268,4.2312,0.248,2.469,0.4359,0.0217,0.0259,0.6885,2.0237,4.905,1.3025,5.3422,2.5013,3.0021,2.8885,1.9474,0.6908,3.8865,0.1037,0.6868,3.357,5.7379,1.9705,2.4059,2.1193,0.6665,2.5482,1.6763,1.3077,0.7318,0.8163,3.7822,0.0235,5.5984,3.9028,4.6451,4.6497,0.5534,0.6601,4.2595,0.0256,1.0591,2.4823,3.7589,3.7572,0.0015,2.433,0.7807,5.1898,2.8741,0.7341,4.6635,0.1682,0.3135,0.2153,0.0004,0.9441,3.2743,2.56,1.0833,0.2766,1.2285,1.1874,1.6069,4.4397,4.4657,1.2574,2.4565,0.0015,0.5003,2.6219,0.0024,0.5712,5.6619,0.9714,3.2611,1.1822,4.404,0.0221,2.9326,1.2489,3.5507,0.2087,7.6501,1.2622,2.9618,0.0079,4.6332,0.62,0.2122,2.4098,2.5086,3.5896,0.5902,0.4476,4.7121,1.3804,5.5244,0.9807,1.4309,3.0299,4.6983,1.488,0.0124,1.6454,1.3866,3.9819,0.4843,5.8249,0.8789,1.2102,4.5269,0.5105,4.3727,3.4897,0.4541,7.4565,3.5573,4.1847,0.005,4.5447,4.8998,6.1392,6.0927,1.4864,2.8682,5.0037,0.3317,0.0425,0.9263,2.7257,1.1446,0.0278,0.0018,0.5612,5.2372,1.6559,0.4749,5.1993,1.0072,0.8934,3.2568,0.3081,0.0007,4.5369,4.4071,4.9317,0.0332,0.2454,3.2657,0.0839,0.0019,0.4844,0.7591,3.1616,4.52,6.0197,3.8495,3.6987,1.8398,3.4934,4.3892,0.3648,3.1591,0.6422,0.2608,0.0876,0.6346,2.3153,2.259,2.5146,0.9885,0.7955,5.6291,0.0012,0.1009,5.0944,0.6508,3.2562,0.259,3.4987,0.3943]}

On the other hand, the Dutch case of 1688 covered two additional original titles for Pedra Branca but both of these were also superseded in 1674.[8] Dutch law did not provide the subject matter of the legal proceedings, although it is thought that this was due to the influence of the Dutch revolutionary leader and anti-Slavery campaigner William Wilberforce, and not to a problem with the law's construction.[9]","token_len":224,"entropy":[5.5104,0.2663,1.7843,8.197,2.6559,5.0487,1.6432,1.5536,11.3278,4.3095,0.7133,11.1425,0.1039,0.0246,0.0001,14.1973,8.3452,7.2708,0.0147,0.0001,0.0002,3.0099,3.9263,1.8339,5.5358,6.4556,0.6748,6.3241,2.6771,8.9223,0.2043,0.5729,0.332,6.6789,0.0184,0.03,0.0071,3.5084,2.6097,2.0274,6.7807,3.3717,2.1744,0.3616,2.8965,1.3536,5.4428,0.0124,0.5423,2.9695,1.9433,2.9743,6.8665,3.5785,0.0274,1.75,5.318,4.2774,1.8219,1.2299,0.0013,0.0023,0.0001,1.0464,0.8971,6.0804,2.4219,0.8656,6.5331,1.3057,1.856,2.5418,0.3894,5.9717,3.5291,1.0132,4.9683,0.3802,2.8129,0.925,0.7975,4.2884,0.4635,3.1245,2.2581,0.5546,4.2669,3.5052,3.2265,4.7895,3.38,1.5954,4.197,0.7994,5.4341,0.0045,5.6868,0.3628,4.0857,4.3236,0.0326,0.1746,1.5181,4.5025,5.0772,0.167,4.6575,2.7099,1.1795,4.6599,4.6145,4.8641,6.4712,1.4984,1.2553,0.6418,0.0013,0.0015,0.0002,2.6425,4.8777,3.1208,0.5825,5.0951,1.6649,3.0559,0.7393,3.3721,0.47,0.3472,3.6246,0.1384,0.6214,2.2859,4.8911,0.9519,0.4696,0.1072,0.1586,0.7257,2.0211,3.5419,4.1399,0.7844,4.9036,6.2347,3.7045,3.9882,1.1914,0.0961,5.5518,0.4835,0.0004,0.0012,0.0001,3.7795,4.6699,1.2664,0.1967,0.6356,3.7556,6.4886,0.0006,1.5189,0.3389,0.3559,2.6758,0.0475,0.0194,5.4976,3.3357,2.5875,0.1322,4.0142,3.7536,5.1876,2.2781,0.9427,0.9115,5.1766,1.9236,2.4879,2.9842,1.2911,2.4545,3.5614,0.1602,3.1748,0.5958,2.4105,0.0727,0.4348,4.4143,0.0405,0.6369,1.7097,5.7971,3.8498,2.3443,5.0942,0.0557,4.0925,0.0519,0.0006,1.4922,3.0981,0.2361,0.178,0.0002,2.0374,3.921,2.5393,1.1361,2.1756,5.5028,1.0215,0.9981,1.3603,3.6347,3.8406,1.0204,0.0184,0.0137]}

At the time, Scotti Brothers had insisted on putting out a new album by Yankovic in order to recoup some of the money they had been burned on the previously released Live at the Hollywood Bowl single. In November 1989, the album was released and has become a cult classic in the punk community. With the music video for \"Till It Happens to You\", Yankovic and live band The Boo Radleys made a splash on MTV and made it to number 3 on the UK charts. The video became the first music video that MTV played in primetime. (For more details on the video including production costs, see Yankovic's Official Magazine article.)\n\nThe album also proved to be an economic success, selling more than 6 million copies in its first two days of release.

He had also been involved in the FA Community Shield against Hull City, where there was a serious clash with the Liverpool players who tried to block some of the crowd throwing projectiles onto the pitch.","token_len":227,"entropy":[8.9293,2.4965,3.6344,0.3101,10.7958,1.8021,5.1916,2.3837,0.0051,0.5054,5.981,11.8,1.4298,0.9824,0.1675,1.5382,1.2756,2.0875,0.4788,0.5214,1.1116,1.9792,0.4624,2.999,2.9473,8.554,0.0701,3.7321,1.6007,0.0372,0.0049,2.7296,2.6765,6.3896,1.9803,0.0893,0.8352,2.7919,2.0365,4.9776,1.346,5.2714,0.0033,6.1392,0.9624,1.016,1.8502,0.5763,4.1885,3.2075,0.0358,0.1227,2.5473,0.8057,2.398,0.2469,0.4695,1.6927,2.4137,0.3022,0.3635,3.2986,5.6306,0.022,0.0056,0.7086,1.7397,1.8667,3.629,4.6808,1.4235,4.2246,0.1378,3.6179,2.9158,0.1653,0.025,3.9452,0.0745,1.7635,3.6771,1.54,0.0134,0.4695,3.2486,1.2314,0.015,0.2312,1.8596,0.0007,0.0074,0.5234,0.0315,0.0803,0.3993,3.6342,0.0252,3.5955,1.0521,0.0141,3.5395,4.9105,4.3471,0.161,2.0953,0.5157,3.2237,6.7907,0.5522,1.8628,0.0759,0.3423,1.5118,1.2529,0.3734,1.1318,1.2848,2.9301,4.1428,2.4398,1.2806,3.3048,1.214,3.1741,0.9604,0.173,0.5396,3.0086,3.4989,3.1221,0.1552,0.1678,0.9601,3.8952,0.6131,1.1914,4.9109,0.0515,0.5689,0.107,0.194,3.8241,0.0864,0.5862,0.0598,0.129,0.4031,0.5374,0.6855,0.0003,5.5369,1.3607,0.1616,0.1795,0.0788,0.847,1.7577,3.654,2.1089,0.8757,0.0033,0.8521,3.8543,0.0163,2.6405,0.2951,0.3644,0.2958,1.8549,1.1097,1.4484,2.1245,0.5462,0.2586,1.1752,1.3376,1.263,5.0004,0.739,0.968,1.4529,0.0782,0.4508,2.1238,1.6702,6.1761,1.734,0.5993,1.7415,4.1153,3.2795,1.4087,3.3982,0.1182,1.0147,5.6163,2.6638,0.0003,2.0441,5.3819,0.0656,1.5744,2.3972,8.1834,0.5862,0.7122,5.169,2.8093,1.4776,1.8387,4.6115,2.1322,3.6747,4.7563,0.047,3.6248,7.1215,0.1901,0.4249,4.2964,3.8855,4.5385,2.4742,0.0176,0.077,0.2276]}

{"id":1095,"ended":true,"length":221,"gen_text":"Over a 20 @ - @ year period during the late 20th century, there was an increase in the number of women in the workforce in Canada. This shift increased father participation in the workplace as well. This is true in both the public and private sectors\n\nThe fact is that women make up 51% of the Canadian workforce but only earn 52% of the male labour force's earnings. As a recent National Household Survey showed, men are more likely to work after age 55. The median work life expectancy in Canada is approximately five years less than men, and that gap seems to continue to increase for new workers, with men working longer. On top of that, more than one-third of Canadian women never work outside of the home, as opposed to just one-fifth of men. If you want more diversity at work, make sure the gender balance is in your favour. You probably won't like this advice, though. In recent years, women's salaries have increased and some governments have made efforts to promote women to senior positions. Still, the pay gap remains \u2013 and so does the gender imbalance \u2013 particularly among female graduates.","token_len":228,"entropy":[3.648,5.9134,13.6803,7.2373,7.9287,5.5209,1.6395,5.5222,0.8141,3.1064,3.2198,0.2414,0.7197,0.4247,3.0758,0.9764,1.6203,1.6277,0.2892,0.8458,1.1391,0.0328,4.3236,2.1806,1.5758,2.2689,2.9963,3.4493,1.0285,2.8453,5.5989,4.9429,10.2753,5.2012,0.8816,0.2589,2.8253,2.2302,0.2223,0.3829,3.3367,2.0798,4.489,1.8454,1.5391,0.9891,2.4482,0.0888,0.0336,0.1881,5.7091,0.009,2.7659,5.0583,1.5126,0.6537,2.3523,4.1517,0.2979,4.9194,0.4674,0.0172,0.5459,1.447,0.8146,2.7189,0.4464,5.0074,3.2898,0.1664,0.0102,0.4098,4.4773,4.2021,0.8758,2.2009,1.7705,0.2457,4.0069,0.7332,6.6163,5.0851,2.2618,0.0072,2.4011,0.1825,2.9466,1.5946,1.5725,0.1977,0.3161,1.1513,6.2006,2.1408,1.314,1.6615,2.7656,4.4341,4.6534,2.1171,0.8635,2.7284,0.1319,0.4046,4.2587,4.5307,0.1139,1.3916,0.5516,3.2104,2.0669,1.0397,3.9969,0.4549,5.9817,0.1119,3.5147,0.9525,3.3562,4.8171,6.4166,4.2258,2.8838,1.6332,1.7596,1.982,1.6112,2.1841,5.4555,2.4205,0.003,0.6081,0.0485,4.1833,1.7638,2.0921,0.8396,0.3964,0.0463,1.722,1.0621,5.7466,2.0575,1.8826,1.2408,0.1716,0.159,1.2926,4.54,1.4432,0.0051,2.4306,1.7528,0.2601,1.4198,0.0869,0.2836,0.1455,5.3389,2.4946,2.7859,3.3608,5.6776,3.1393,0.3008,0.213,3.5956,0.4523,2.8929,3.1235,1.4184,0.6933,2.4838,1.1279,0.1087,0.4836,5.4208,5.6559,1.04,0.0007,3.0137,4.8207,2.9863,0.9957,3.7898,0.5158,4.5546,5.5257,0.309,0.2073,2.6356,2.4659,4.284,0.1864,3.13,3.9107,4.5934,5.4495,0.565,2.9841,2.1515,0.0695,2.807,1.6893,3.1007,2.9633,0.7847,0.5712,3.4262,0.0331,1.9515,3.2029,0.0785,1.7282,4.7888,1.7649,5.2714,0.3817,0.2382,1.7853,2.1895,3.9662,4.5621,2.9214,4.7507,4.2281,0.4649]}

We also provide examples of how AI enables us to do amazing things, including solving global challenges.","token_len":229,"entropy":[4.6317,0.1905,9.6812,1.8186,1.2706,6.9525,0.8593,6.7379,0.7489,2.2812,4.2932,7.7182,0.0391,4.4781,1.8665,1.5796,4.7791,5.3514,7.825,2.1616,2.1383,0.0102,4.7246,1.3577,0.2306,2.7879,5.6067,2.8179,6.1005,1.5326,0.0801,2.4268,5.533,0.7323,4.1847,0.6032,2.571,3.5978,1.7926,2.6434,0.0006,0.9368,0.0762,3.2747,1.0319,1.8284,1.6561,2.6448,1.2451,4.2287,1.9142,0.5276,2.4892,1.874,3.4424,0.577,0.5509,3.1416,2.8131,3.9975,0.7239,3.0766,0.8598,2.7439,0.7924,1.3265,2.2946,2.6124,3.2716,1.6443,0.2363,0.0021,4.771,2.1739,0.9167,4.8546,5.4894,5.4299,0.0048,0.2,3.9419,3.7548,3.6897,0.276,0.473,0.0015,0.6511,1.3502,4.755,1.4603,0.5536,5.1227,1.1243,4.2418,1.3496,0.7775,3.9733,2.8273,0.0503,0.0049,4.3379,5.6325,2.9861,2.7434,4.1212,3.4187,0.9951,1.957,0.104,4.403,1.1872,3.5221,4.2599,0.9813,1.2545,0.0028,2.3652,0.9437,0.9402,2.3447,4.6638,0.7952,2.116,0.1704,0.7554,4.7605,0.6271,4.1606,1.8568,2.9228,0.0252,0.3892,1.5388,0.0727,0.806,4.0216,1.5719,0.1735,0.7009,2.7871,6.5711,1.1721,0.3812,1.0461,0.0002,3.0408,0.902,6.4684,0.0645,0.916,0.9818,4.4678,0.8631,4.6612,7.0845,1.6118,3.4366,2.3693,1.7839,0.2063,0.2938,0.9636,0.1255,0.7275,4.4344,1.0056,1.4098,1.6258,1.1075,6.0681,1.5762,2.5252,5.9981,0.6948,0.0592,4.3717,2.2672,3.2918,3.6996,3.5273,5.094,2.779,3.3334,1.7199,2.0676,0.0002,3.4152,2.6361,5.9645,4.7897,0.4353,1.2478,4.9341,0.4748,0.4045,4.5778,3.4195,0.0554,0.5458,4.4251,2.153,0.6292,0.6332,2.2891,3.2836,2.4823,3.7541,1.3695,0.8371,3.6434,4.8435,3.1384,3.5675,0.2223,0.6861,0.5858,7.7269,2.364,0.0214,2.7131,4.6116,0.0513,1.6057,3.5776,4.0607,4.8902,2.5945,1.9922]}

The animals are being hunted for their pelts and bones.","token_len":230,"entropy":[10.4163,3.9295,1.2991,6.3439,8.6743,0.0031,0.7977,2.4223,6.961,0.0248,0.127,2.9032,4.3598,0.1101,0.4314,0.4,2.0712,4.5616,1.8066,1.0744,0.1858,1.4768,1.1811,0.8115,8.4082,2.7021,0.4699,0.0308,1.5154,6.9184,0.0006,4.7002,0.3384,9.0976,2.7853,6.7894,2.5188,0.9406,3.3734,1.3278,2.057,3.4026,1.8596,4.6957,4.9739,1.4673,4.6109,1.5133,5.035,3.0186,1.4967,2.0832,8.0919,0.0055,1.934,0.7333,0.0129,3.9856,1.6383,2.3798,4.0478,1.7155,0.0379,1.0055,2.7488,6.3319,0.8901,2.119,0.023,0.1299,1.1226,1.7599,5.4798,4.3061,4.2015,2.403,4.744,0.712,0.1497,0.7146,0.836,3.9305,0.8562,2.6957,3.5298,0.9479,1.0906,0.991,0.648,4.3035,0.0059,5.5527,0.8339,1.5072,5.9915,0.002,1.1696,2.6739,3.8979,1.6295,0.9916,0.5555,1.1115,0.0002,2.5303,2.0347,3.575,1.1002,0.2451,2.5831,1.6802,1.5164,2.0677,5.2338,0.9073,1.2636,3.3276,1.1586,4.9604,2.2374,2.7488,2.4607,5.0054,1.2023,0.1157,0.2987,1.6352,4.6793,0.7538,5.032,3.854,3.1828,3.5347,3.727,0.4084,0.8017,0.1525,2.1972,1.3371,3.1414,0.0146,0.5298,0.2055,2.2402,1.035,3.8487,0.1966,2.2861,0.0147,5.1361,4.9619,1.6642,2.0352,3.5161,0.2609,2.0077,1.587,2.6282,8.0434,6.0802,0.7326,4.5957,0.0231,0.0071,0.0017,0.7137,2.6679,2.4937,0.0019,0.4185,1.0082,0.0002,5.4831,0.2082,1.7437,0.5608,3.6193,5.1074,1.2353,2.4512,0.2435,2.7706,3.357,2.0928,1.3738,3.7311,2.8458,0.3375,3.4454,0.6932,0.4922,0.4812,1.0361,0.5036,1.0692,2.3473,0.4266,2.1106,3.3628,2.7642,0.0218,2.4431,0.2796,1.1805,1.0027,1.8479,2.4415,2.2479,3.5985,3.2653,1.0045,0.0074,5.5209,1.6799,4.0931,3.3138,0.3866,2.9516,3.4206,0.6743,2.0703,3.0768,1.4627,0.7094,1.3796,0.0001,1.3145,3.3038,1.2592]}

For example, a large number of chemicals can be created from water, ethanol, glucose or amino acids ( Figure 1 ). The use of enzymes has helped us to solve many complex ecological problems.

Most thrushes find a new mate in mid September, when they mate again to give birth on 1st October!\n\nThe female eats eggs during the second half of August and September.\n\nThe breeding females have a strong wingbeat, and can fly quickly with powerful wings flapping up to 60 times per second. As they mate the males release a pheromone that attracts females to where he deposits the eggs. The female has a strong taste for the egg sacs so it will always try to eat them first thing every morning. The eggs are incubated between 15 and 17 days, but usually hatch shortly after the first flight. If you want your thrush to give birth to large flocks of small thrushes, you should monitor the nesting dates closely, and make sure that the female keeps your flock together otherwise the new flock will be dispersed. It can take several years using natural methods to convince thrushes to breed so some of the best results come with artificial solutions..","token_len":231,"entropy":[12.3564,5.3577,1.8752,6.9925,0.0133,2.3423,6.4671,0.0562,1.0759,3.6089,2.3762,3.8629,15.8046,4.9149,7.5655,4.197,4.5078,2.1972,2.4865,2.1802,1.648,1.0863,1.5659,1.0634,3.9857,5.6002,5.612,0.2184,2.0515,0.0425,0.3042,5.593,3.0395,0.1287,7.3815,1.9933,4.7214,1.2721,2.1129,2.5575,5.4894,1.4678,3.7092,1.4396,3.287,1.697,4.29,3.1979,0.299,4.9326,4.4723,0.5339,0.8477,6.9634,1.2306,0.019,2.6858,2.1988,5.2562,4.7615,3.9197,0.4032,4.7696,1.059,0.0089,3.7191,1.2576,1.8831,1.0017,2.0408,0.0001,1.3595,4.9309,5.3957,2.9405,0.9648,4.0983,5.1549,2.1531,1.3294,1.2445,2.1473,0.3451,5.0359,4.4532,6.1261,1.8249,4.8396,0.0988,2.4665,0.0617,3.1183,0.4871,0.2862,0.2892,0.295,5.298,1.6617,3.3472,3.5097,3.2247,5.2895,0.7358,2.6736,0.0072,0.0052,0.0073,1.2489,0.6973,1.4268,1.571,6.5704,2.5211,4.5581,1.5916,0.3001,0.2416,1.7769,1.3337,4.3767,1.0779,2.3938,3.9347,0.0787,0.8168,3.3472,3.4655,0.4129,4.0952,2.7959,2.657,4.907,2.658,0.1785,2.4773,1.3382,1.3963,5.4728,5.2965,0.0503,0.6719,2.0197,2.0036,0.8403,3.8344,0.0118,4.7561,3.1791,1.048,2.6852,0.1404,1.2085,3.1296,2.8468,3.448,5.734,0.1141,2.9705,1.3806,5.0492,0.8119,5.4205,1.717,2.8069,2.993,0.9161,0.0847,0.1449,4.0955,0.6498,1.5575,5.4344,3.7887,0.054,1.2148,4.6096,2.1257,0.0982,0.6863,1.5633,1.8011,4.7112,0.8317,5.2634,6.6302,1.6406,2.1051,0.8323,2.566,0.115,1.5527,1.055,2.0934,5.3147,5.2702,2.2774,2.137,7.1697,1.6231,4.5369,2.5112,0.6941,1.6746,3.3449,0.9055,4.2499,2.9121,0.7508,2.8581,1.2816,9.7657,4.5777,1.8383,0.8325,5.7434,3.2837,0.2825,0.0724,1.3405,6.1651,6.2507,2.9468,0.884,1.7355,2.0469,2.0322,3.0968,1.1273,6.413,7.5639]}

As a result, regiments that did not have them were unable to show off their patriotism and were forced to give up their hats.\n\nOf course, what we call rosettes today are in fact knotwork decorations used to mark a regiment or some other unit as belonging to a particular nation.","token_len":232,"entropy":[1.7422,7.0541,0.4826,2.2935,0.1245,0.0011,0.0923,0.2683,4.4745,3.6986,4.5215,11.1863,4.0376,2.207,1.915,9.9637,2.2434,6.492,6.2825,0.0062,7.0697,0.5769,0.939,3.9117,1.0741,0.7304,3.2965,2.1846,3.2888,0.1006,1.3657,3.4518,3.5638,2.4617,8.31,0.2467,8.5638,3.1649,4.499,0.0703,4.3136,4.5524,0.0619,5.9902,3.4025,0.0137,1.5682,1.9073,0.2196,4.6184,0.1459,0.3301,3.1306,5.9767,1.2437,0.5265,3.6829,0.0162,4.6236,4.4994,2.5059,4.4511,1.7799,2.4197,1.0244,0.0033,1.5,5.7711,3.253,1.2335,1.2739,0.0018,5.6681,3.4233,4.0892,1.3324,1.0166,2.5175,0.0116,0.5872,0.0144,0.036,3.5521,1.1811,2.0963,1.1958,1.2104,6.3088,3.9814,4.0443,0.4911,0.0712,4.8263,0.3314,0.52,5.9246,0.8106,1.9306,4.5567,3.5871,2.8572,0.0088,1.0275,2.9713,0.0002,4.2623,1.1853,3.7047,0.15,1.6702,0.9682,3.7332,0.3796,2.9091,1.6037,1.3706,4.9073,1.5596,3.9871,0.5248,2.3545,4.1475,1.8389,0.6295,0.0841,0.4815,1.7439,0.0044,3.2657,2.7217,1.7671,2.0768,5.1432,1.0767,4.2291,0.006,0.1239,3.4611,0.0593,2.7969,0.2589,4.7989,0.0084,0.0847,2.5735,0.2933,5.1861,4.9531,3.3664,2.2875,0.1842,3.8703,0.0943,0.8919,2.8385,6.8173,1.8384,0.0042,0.2378,0.5599,5.6097,3.2558,0.6788,3.7508,3.28,2.9582,1.5147,2.3589,0.0124,0.1891,4.6327,0.7346,0.1796,0.1434,3.0671,0.1533,2.0574,1.447,0.0312,0.5298,4.6256,1.4013,3.521,0.0061,4.0706,2.4698,0.1397,2.0573,2.1148,1.9314,1.5903,0.0389,4.3415,0.3233,0.6453,2.5183,0.928,0.6277,0.0002,5.7423,0.1518,0.0882,5.7539,2.9161,3.0196,2.1307,0.0036,0.0685,0.5875,1.6479,3.2016,0.1395,3.9225,1.7198,3.4632,4.4152,0.8248,2.5921,2.5163,3.0014,2.6231,6.1824,0.2497,1.2883,3.2399,0.796,0.0135,0.8067,0.5696,1.6867,0.6453]}

{"id":756,"ended":true,"length":202,"gen_text":"In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several campaigners and writers characterised Tintin in the Congo as racist due to its portrayal of the Congolese as infantile and stupid. According to Tom Holland's Tintin: Life in the Congo, the Congo was referred to in Tintin as 'a country where the only race is the negro, and that's the word he uses.' When the magazine's then editor Robert Maxwell introduced Tintin to African audiences he was not aware of the book.\n\nIt is a common stereotype that Tintin is a European and that he has no problem with African people or the West. The first book in the series was published in 1885 and Tintin arrived on the scene at the beginning of the second world war. A cartoon published in an African newspaper in 1957 by Max Littwin, illustrated by Robert Lebrecht, depicted African soldiers trying to kidnap Tintin. In recent years, Tintin's adventures and the racism he often faced on his adventures have been explored in a film, Black Tintin, directed by Steve McQueen, starring Johnny Depp.","token_len":234,"entropy":[1.7422,4.6715,4.319,0.0576,2.545,0.0256,0.014,0.0029,0.1459,0.1813,5.4485,11.1461,2.6393,2.9904,10.5626,0.0155,7.7609,5.0413,0.0254,3.3268,1.9442,8.5692,0.3142,4.8047,5.6813,0.017,3.2748,1.5039,0.0088,1.1311,3.2096,0.0024,0.0,0.7749,9.7344,0.766,1.3026,3.196,0.4602,5.274,0.0039,6.7345,3.0316,1.8532,2.7343,0.0008,0.002,1.7624,5.3203,1.0361,0.5313,0.7047,0.6637,1.5172,3.6186,1.0306,5.8413,0.0054,2.0781,2.4757,0.0001,0.0008,0.7325,2.1458,1.8549,2.4172,2.9524,1.5557,3.9864,5.2994,1.0618,0.741,4.0365,2.8111,0.9826,3.5054,2.5,1.7821,5.8632,3.9686,0.5013,2.1252,5.4941,1.7765,5.0004,2.2686,4.7547,0.5045,5.1736,3.8139,5.2408,1.6197,0.0003,0.001,0.4046,4.3085,2.5842,2.8831,1.7302,4.3887,3.014,0.4639,0.587,4.6977,5.2432,2.0345,0.0046,4.1944,1.2072,3.29,2.7791,4.5739,0.488,1.5406,0.0001,0.0013,1.5034,1.2212,5.64,3.3894,1.5694,1.4998,2.8701,2.3647,4.1535,0.3433,2.5028,0.8991,3.5591,2.291,5.7909,0.5483,2.8036,4.4992,3.7662,0.988,0.2073,0.3385,1.6658,0.6184,0.1061,3.0984,2.4014,1.1415,1.7124,0.0004,0.0013,4.1391,4.1065,0.1249,1.6207,2.8203,0.611,1.4769,0.0018,0.1207,3.8842,0.1771,0.0047,0.4446,4.5019,4.8885,1.8071,0.3613,5.1806,1.9015,0.361,0.6292,4.4326,4.3296,5.666,4.9251,2.8289,4.1603,1.931,4.4103,0.3739,4.4985,4.902,5.4855,0.1849,0.3248,1.804,5.0193,1.5479,5.4703,0.0235,5.3339,0.598,0.0004,0.0006,1.3231,2.5937,5.5935,0.2116,0.7909,1.8851,0.0007,0.0023,2.5606,2.6909,4.024,2.4993,4.3058,1.8502,4.3751,2.6191,3.8264,1.6649,1.1383,0.3424,0.5177,2.793,0.38,1.4918,3.833,1.7451,6.6455,0.8725,0.0144,0.001,0.7113,1.615,0.0105,4.9148,0.5446,0.0026,1.8474,2.0964,1.468,0.059,0.0,0.9656]}
{"id":2520,"ended":true,"length":219,"gen_text":"The evolution of the wolf occurred over a geologic time scale of 800 thousand years, transforming the first Middle Pleistocene wolf specimen that is recognized as being morphologically similar to Canis lupus into today's wolf. The evolution of the wolf is not only a physical change of species, but because of the dramatic changes that have been observed in the animal's behavior, the wolf's ancestors probably had a far wider range of adaptations than the wolves we know today. For example, researchers have shown that wolves have the strongest heart of any animal, and that they have four teeth in their upper jaw and three in their lower jaw, much larger teeth than have been found in the remaining species of wolf. There are also differences in anatomy of the canine teeth and the way that the jaw joints work than those of Canis lupus or the larger gray wolf. As a result of the numerous small anatomical changes that have occurred in the wolf as it became an adaptable canid, it is estimated that it may have expanded from the Middle East, where there are believed to have been only five to ten known Canis lupus, to its current global distribution.","token_len":234,"entropy":[9.442,0.1678,1.3363,8.8412,7.177,2.431,1.7128,6.0878,0.0766,0.6273,1.0743,1.1727,6.97,5.1048,0.158,1.3296,10.5083,1.8042,5.5088,8.6088,1.8233,0.0016,0.0003,1.7789,7.8808,4.8502,3.3549,5.4692,1.1359,4.2699,7.1043,0.0099,2.605,0.1438,6.8866,0.0035,0.094,0.0,0.0036,1.4192,5.8225,0.0024,2.1377,0.6419,1.6096,2.8621,0.1254,0.5613,1.095,1.7833,3.5874,3.0011,1.6467,5.1137,1.5559,2.6479,3.1693,0.7373,0.1149,7.924,0.6741,0.9635,5.3798,1.5419,2.3226,2.7422,3.1175,2.7756,0.4628,0.7358,4.9935,0.5706,1.2985,0.6809,2.4998,1.7253,2.7849,6.0621,4.7964,1.6462,1.4609,4.5314,3.3822,0.2641,0.5191,3.8457,1.1882,2.4429,3.2661,1.1527,0.8183,0.0727,0.2499,3.6454,0.33,0.0209,6.2583,0.7971,3.1904,0.0504,2.3355,2.0775,2.7047,5.0584,6.0656,1.7322,0.2507,1.955,1.2648,1.7114,1.4236,1.5205,1.3104,6.1368,4.6188,0.9253,0.7296,1.0893,0.6581,3.0442,2.216,0.6346,0.1579,0.0318,0.0868,1.3707,4.4503,1.8761,2.1369,0.1229,5.1209,0.6934,0.8484,0.0703,2.8695,4.6465,3.0949,0.2129,1.882,0.4678,4.8315,0.7706,1.1299,3.1191,0.2217,5.3758,2.4582,0.275,3.2775,0.15,1.8182,1.1786,4.3537,1.6661,1.1023,2.925,3.2048,2.6299,4.7535,4.261,0.545,4.7766,0.0098,0.0388,0.0002,0.0007,4.1127,2.1985,6.0242,2.8029,0.2974,0.4811,4.377,1.1653,0.2478,0.9607,1.5368,5.1469,6.9881,1.9794,0.5013,0.808,0.692,0.5522,0.7909,0.3651,0.5983,4.7021,0.61,4.0981,3.5957,2.6224,0.1219,6.1942,0.005,0.2052,1.254,0.7937,4.1274,0.0361,2.6604,3.024,0.1145,4.0043,2.9186,2.3993,1.9432,1.4116,3.3322,2.3576,4.6259,1.0547,5.2659,0.0023,0.9926,0.0441,2.0204,3.2585,2.3882,1.3629,4.9059,5.3348,0.0107,1.4095,0.0007,0.0779,1.8832,0.3162,4.349,0.6985,3.6323,0.7527,0.9729]}

Meanwhile, Nico Rosberg won the first race in Australia.","token_len":237,"entropy":[1.2507,3.9609,3.1572,10.7994,1.2274,0.0003,5.2449,5.6751,1.8443,0.2678,0.5319,2.6657,3.1923,2.5223,0.9338,1.048,3.6647,6.5146,0.0429,0.0003,0.0015,0.0001,4.8465,6.2373,4.294,0.0079,1.5462,3.981,7.8079,0.0614,0.7945,5.6668,0.0111,0.0,3.2048,2.096,4.2527,0.0295,0.0,0.0,2.3956,1.405,2.3314,4.928,5.1512,0.1817,3.2314,0.0004,0.0605,0.0004,0.009,0.9107,2.5653,4.4784,4.2005,4.5613,0.2971,4.815,0.8407,0.5175,2.2223,0.0015,0.0192,3.8927,0.0014,0.8763,0.0015,2.0722,1.7502,2.2322,4.4216,6.296,5.0296,1.4796,1.992,1.4569,2.6775,3.3774,5.3025,3.8084,2.4062,4.668,1.6207,5.673,1.1407,3.7611,1.7761,5.1666,2.938,0.0009,0.0352,3.3017,2.0143,6.2058,1.6845,3.7256,1.2182,2.6687,1.4293,3.5633,6.57,2.5625,1.3797,0.003,1.1367,2.5832,2.6995,3.9053,1.2686,0.0478,1.931,0.2721,0.1894,4.0493,0.0001,3.5145,4.9056,0.0029,1.3698,4.9953,3.1144,0.072,3.5991,0.4697,5.6872,0.0007,0.0334,0.1194,0.7282,0.6791,1.2083,2.4784,0.0066,0.0072,1.743,2.3581,4.9152,4.0014,1.3832,5.4351,0.0459,2.4891,3.3904,1.1912,1.9286,0.7091,5.465,2.4085,0.0001,0.7451,4.0737,4.4745,4.8148,1.3074,0.0774,1.4169,0.2955,1.3553,1.1608,1.1027,2.1781,4.2709,0.0479,1.1191,0.833,1.8684,2.9307,3.5738,0.0853,2.5751,0.0062,0.9315,2.3748,0.0005,0.193,4.5891,0.7471,0.1562,0.3577,1.3872,0.0024,0.7172,2.8376,0.0693,2.2557,3.2902,0.5818,3.1057,0.3858,1.1567,3.3472,1.6744,3.1564,4.8666,0.6716,1.2294,3.3845,0.5516,3.118,1.2671,4.1432,3.4488,3.5592,1.8007,3.9419,2.6352,2.7889,5.0468,2.4324,1.9961,0.5922,3.9729,3.1582,4.6662,0.8399,1.1033,3.2137,0.3684,0.8692,2.7056,2.12,0.2529,4.0411,9.2042,5.9971,0.1673,4.5905,0.0406,0.0002,2.9261,0.2439,2.7296,0.2673,2.3177,2.865,1.829]}

{"id":1679,"ended":true,"length":240,"gen_text":"Ghost in the Shell used a novel process called `` digitally generated animation `` ( DGA ), which is a combination of cel animation, computer graphics ( CG ), and audio that allows the animation to be animated exactly as created by the production team. The DGA method was so successful with the original animated films that there was no reason to keep the process in the script, as it was already complete. In the animated films, the effects were also done digitally. Now that live action films are also being made in CG, the process is less necessary. In the original films, the directors actually made the CG effects, and the animators were simply the technicians that set up the CG effects. The CG films would usually have fewer characters than live action films, with less complex characters, and they were usually much more colorful. For example, a large character like a robot in the first live action film was about as complex as an ordinary human. The CG films tend to have much more complex robots than live action films, and there are many reasons for this, which are discussed below. This means that the use of CG in live action films is becoming less and less necessary as the technology becomes more advanced and affordable.","token_len":241,"entropy":[4.7703,0.0585,0.0294,9.4983,2.3347,5.7752,6.8392,3.8362,9.0379,13.6413,5.9914,4.2938,2.4791,2.0992,4.303,0.3164,1.8293,0.898,1.9617,1.6824,3.5985,0.0109,6.7134,0.7244,2.3082,2.2375,1.541,3.7724,1.3385,1.3165,0.3136,6.3591,5.7355,2.3856,1.0397,2.7304,0.4152,0.6301,3.4056,6.0751,0.9283,6.2104,0.9921,0.2631,4.3178,1.1931,0.5592,1.7528,2.1575,0.0078,3.1234,1.9717,5.2569,0.8928,4.2667,0.6768,2.921,3.6821,3.2248,0.4751,4.6257,1.5129,1.6556,2.0934,0.4427,5.008,1.4104,2.1573,2.6806,0.9615,5.2073,2.0609,3.0869,0.8537,1.0045,1.7798,5.1061,0.7247,2.9673,1.005,5.0326,1.3404,0.2401,0.8029,5.6395,1.1589,3.5126,2.1141,1.5968,1.4405,6.0603,1.815,6.1966,0.5671,1.1518,0.5636,3.6215,0.9207,2.274,2.7968,0.6815,0.2521,1.2207,3.2189,1.4096,5.2817,3.2978,0.7862,2.7798,1.1404,2.3109,2.0115,0.1167,0.8283,5.8003,5.5531,3.6579,0.9559,1.2586,1.2655,2.0216,1.2373,1.4586,2.8844,0.0109,2.4965,2.8647,3.168,2.7173,1.8065,5.4239,0.3874,0.4579,1.5744,1.2484,0.5135,1.9727,2.5116,5.7941,5.0171,3.8913,1.481,4.8764,3.965,1.0568,1.876,0.0448,0.2026,0.5556,3.9456,3.6853,3.885,2.6468,1.8741,1.1306,3.304,1.604,1.7305,2.7189,1.3607,4.6201,0.9868,3.7363,0.8707,0.0281,3.8947,5.1645,2.7615,0.5997,1.6302,2.264,2.4527,1.1309,2.2864,1.327,0.0243,0.337,2.5672,2.7224,2.9287,0.8819,0.1274,2.7286,2.3103,1.7352,2.002,1.5959,1.6007,1.1076,3.8236,0.0221,0.541,2.1303,0.9476,0.474,4.1694,2.9426,0.6351,0.0043,0.1398,0.8271,0.9464,4.0546,0.6502,2.0504,3.8658,0.1923,0.1493,1.6487,4.024,2.1745,1.0591,1.1551,0.0626,4.4184,4.1653,0.089,0.935,5.2574,0.0053,1.1597,1.3627,0.4774,0.0063,0.2998,0.6658,2.1913,0.6394,0.9234,0.0005,0.9374,2.6214,0.9959,1.6039,1.6523,0.2908,0.8607,2.2315,4.5396,0.2124]}

In 1939, the Delaware state highway system opened for traffic to accommodate the newly constructed Delaware Aqueduct.

On January 4, 1948, the Delaware Department of Highways began operating on a five month schedule since Interstate 95 was built in Delaware the year prior. On July 14, 1948, Governor L.O. Johnson signed into law a bill that authorized the creation of the DEIS Division (later known as DEIS Office). The DEIS and the office were combined on May 8, 1964.

In addition, MSU is the second top public university in the state in terms of degree awarded to students pursuing a major in music.\n\nA total of 5,863 undergraduate music majors received an honors degree, 5,564 graduated from a music and performing arts degree program, and 8,085 gained a master's degree.\n\nGraduates of MSU's undergraduate and graduate music programs held positions in nearly 75 professions, ranging from the president of the state to sales managers.","token_len":243,"entropy":[4.9906,0.573,0.268,9.3351,1.5922,2.1134,7.3668,1.5827,0.1032,2.8426,4.1851,1.3421,5.256,5.577,9.7986,2.2382,3.9491,0.004,8.3734,8.0619,1.7161,4.9016,0.1485,4.6794,1.0157,2.0454,7.5345,2.8939,0.0446,6.1103,2.1429,4.6077,1.6027,1.2782,8.4168,0.4486,0.8654,0.0007,0.035,3.2334,0.8318,0.9615,2.645,2.8725,2.8146,1.6784,1.3522,0.1795,1.9006,5.2501,0.5934,1.1987,5.5113,3.482,1.2913,4.4967,5.4808,0.4112,5.2005,1.0561,0.2248,1.1182,0.0006,5.5756,3.3701,0.4307,2.219,0.0353,0.9767,2.3081,0.0044,5.193,2.8526,2.5081,2.1535,2.2064,0.0324,0.3722,2.2294,2.5217,0.0471,0.7071,3.4443,0.9248,1.7434,4.3239,1.1667,3.1142,3.86,0.0967,3.3676,0.0009,4.9117,1.9949,4.0276,3.4262,1.3744,0.0045,1.9542,0.5052,3.1041,0.001,3.6475,3.1766,0.4447,4.7655,0.7391,0.2047,3.1905,0.0009,0.8973,3.0285,3.3731,0.0359,1.7245,5.9259,0.4259,4.8937,0.0589,0.3571,2.2783,0.0011,3.1351,1.8677,1.5843,2.8346,0.7593,0.0067,2.846,3.3836,0.2784,0.7069,0.5762,1.8472,1.0705,0.4271,3.8415,0.0194,0.8027,0.0001,0.0157,1.6545,3.1555,1.0787,0.3219,0.633,0.0004,1.827,2.592,3.5623,4.7771,1.9999,0.6857,0.4306,0.3358,1.7423,2.8858,0.8217,0.0042,5.8429,2.5419,0.9209,2.149,1.0218,0.5882,1.5619,0.0304,0.1563,0.4205,0.5231,0.0002,4.1007,3.6061,0.0067,3.2658,1.0191,6.05,1.1529,2.2782,2.6035,0.1692,3.1603,3.0502,5.7732,0.308,2.8148,3.6232,0.1678,4.3329,2.4471,3.3505,2.3177,2.07,2.1066,6.2191,3.9478,0.2328,2.0258,1.0321,0.403,0.497,3.5067,0.7916,5.0027,1.8179,6.7707,0.8544,2.4601,0.0814,0.0791,1.2567,1.6775,0.0002,3.1331,1.6346,0.4056,1.0404,0.0005,0.0477,2.1854,0.9901,0.0348,0.9049,0.1088,6.2877,1.6866,0.432,4.5191,5.092,4.0608,1.1836,2.8336,0.0087,3.0113,4.1452,0.3202,0.7255,3.4771,0.8709,5.4222,2.4047,2.1134]}

The Giants will have two options: The Giants can either sign Reed to a one-year contract for $2.5 million, with bonus pay the first year: If he fails to meet the Giants' physical requirements, he could be suspended four games (total game suspension) or he could be placed on Injured Reserve, meaning the Giants would pay a minimum of $2.5 million, and possibly more. If Reed meets the physical requirements, the Giants can extend the contract through the 2013 season.

The next day it moved offshore in the Atlantic to south of southern New Zealand.\n\nThe wave formed when a rotating section of the jet stream broke free from the cold ocean to move across the globe. With the flow weakened, warm water that was forced out began to cool, eventually cooling so much that warm jet stream winds could spread away, and the high pressure oceanic currents formed. This then led to the intense stormy weather that struck the U.S. On June 11, with the weather system pushing toward the east, coastal areas were hit with wind gusts over 100 mph with rainfall up to 9 inches in some areas. In the southeastern United States, the storm system forced the evacuation of New Orleans, forcing more than 6 inches of rain in some areas and causing damage to dozens of bridges and some homes. On June 13, with the storm system moving toward the north-central United States, coastal areas of the Gulf Coast and western Atlantic coasts were hit with wind gusts of up to 70 mph with thunderstorms and some flooding.","token_len":244,"entropy":[10.2496,6.0238,6.0842,3.8597,0.1283,1.7667,0.1998,3.4992,6.5889,0.4275,3.7813,1.8943,1.199,2.1971,2.7247,3.2621,2.1339,5.2319,1.4484,1.4991,4.53,3.5891,3.2356,0.1965,0.7868,2.0522,4.0122,3.6895,0.1104,4.9663,1.2613,0.343,1.524,1.5759,4.9957,0.3017,2.7001,1.964,4.8732,4.1637,0.3176,3.8598,4.2456,5.3947,0.3066,5.0524,3.3634,1.8735,0.6972,1.5254,0.001,1.399,3.5164,3.367,3.1806,0.7585,6.4041,4.6182,0.0213,0.6473,2.9663,0.0208,4.6567,3.4807,0.7188,0.7192,3.2635,4.4722,4.5769,3.4767,2.7365,0.1421,3.4051,0.4366,6.039,0.8414,4.9696,3.8947,0.4402,4.977,1.5411,4.601,1.5036,4.8481,2.1978,8.4204,0.2477,3.2169,1.6671,4.6187,2.9905,4.4255,0.6663,0.1994,5.3036,6.4947,0.3682,1.747,2.0691,4.8037,6.1253,4.2051,3.3706,1.0743,5.7775,0.2941,6.4242,3.5912,4.1112,4.4868,1.2428,3.0209,4.328,2.4586,0.0533,0.9281,5.3841,2.3705,3.502,0.6725,1.5375,4.2821,1.0427,2.2492,0.0015,0.0335,0.0729,4.9477,0.4355,0.9314,0.2502,5.9886,0.7078,4.3178,1.4043,5.1619,3.7129,0.4849,1.7473,0.6213,6.1717,1.0438,1.6769,1.1948,0.6126,3.9311,0.569,0.0022,3.6357,1.4511,0.5753,4.2995,4.5432,3.2977,0.0025,4.2523,0.0853,1.2354,0.4972,0.8785,0.1721,3.302,1.9162,4.7656,1.4015,0.0041,0.1803,1.63,1.009,2.7789,5.2389,1.5702,1.3357,0.0087,3.7605,0.5568,1.3379,3.7202,2.9955,0.0472,3.9054,7.5539,0.0752,0.0908,1.2309,0.7098,0.4835,2.0863,1.2553,4.0119,0.5523,4.6573,0.0042,1.9647,1.1312,4.7768,1.9865,0.1635,3.4228,0.1855,2.3612,0.1081,3.5325,0.2714,0.623,0.3944,1.0596,2.0134,0.2118,3.319,2.2801,0.951,0.3667,0.0008,0.1175,2.4185,0.0583,3.5482,1.1997,4.2261,0.4239,1.7038,4.9726,3.7021,4.1312,0.3352,0.3441,0.2164,1.031,0.0107,0.0018,1.0636,1.314,0.0037,2.3695,0.0432,0.8231,5.8545,0.1414,1.3574,4.5339,1.6923,0.3364]}

Route A followed the Delaware River and opened in 1953, and Route C was built between the intersection of North 6th and N 6th Streets and N 5th and S 4th Streets. The first stage of the new railroad line ran parallel with Route A and was constructed in 1954. This railroad bypass allowed Wilmington and its suburbs to achieve a high quality of life and the high standard of living that people expect from living in a modern metropolitan area.\n\nIn the 1980s, Wilmington continued to grow rapidly with more than 200 new development units planned for North East Plaza and the development of the North Market with a 4-story, 500,000 square feet shopping mall. The development of the North Market was the first development completed in Wilmington in more than twenty years, and the first significant residential redevelopment in the city since the late 1970s.\n\nIn 1986, there were more than 4,000 new residents who moved to Wilmington. The city's population increased by more than 50,000 during this period alone.

He asked if the party could accept a joint ticket between liberal and southern states. The conversation was recorded because Nixon intended to make it public later that day.\n\nNixon resigned the presidency the next day. Three days later he married Rosemary, his long-time mistress. Four years before his death, when Nixon received a public patsy on the night he was shot, his political operatives knew it would take a significant number of delegates to win the nomination. This led the FBI to set up an informant that they could have a better case on for any future prosecution.\n\nBy 1968, the Republican Party had begun abandoning its long-held policies. As a result, the Johnson-Goldwater ticket in 1968 won more popular votes but less than 50% of the delegate count. Nixon, who came in second, campaigned with liberal, southern candidates that gained a significant amount of delegates.\n\nNixon's assassination also led to the creation of the Republican National Committee (RNC), which took on a more conservative stance towards third parties.","token_len":245,"entropy":[4.6836,3.5312,0.3369,6.1757,0.1454,5.9006,5.2215,0.5147,4.7093,0.5042,0.3568,2.2691,3.4191,1.4012,2.4913,0.7351,2.9807,3.8141,4.331,4.2109,11.8704,0.0931,3.8814,2.4921,7.6663,6.232,3.4021,0.4009,1.2518,0.1471,1.4389,0.2688,0.6509,2.8598,3.5581,3.8395,2.2691,3.5418,1.5318,3.9605,1.3062,5.1181,0.7119,2.1933,6.5974,3.1215,7.9012,3.4826,1.0779,2.0044,5.0022,1.2259,1.8742,7.324,1.1744,6.0616,0.1685,3.1584,1.2752,0.2322,2.4996,1.7977,0.969,0.3178,1.0814,0.0008,2.6986,0.0171,6.9733,1.8239,1.9061,2.3452,0.5081,0.3008,0.8833,5.6237,0.4786,0.2512,3.0603,5.6939,3.1034,0.246,1.6794,1.6256,2.9896,0.0675,0.2968,1.452,0.4473,5.5627,1.5981,5.7221,1.8326,0.9275,0.6191,5.5638,2.9171,5.9744,1.9914,5.729,5.7605,3.4611,0.4338,4.8732,0.9745,5.1994,2.6516,0.8315,1.776,0.3462,2.7956,4.3857,3.9597,5.5809,3.4289,1.5663,3.9682,1.4585,5.8896,3.1558,0.0044,2.1987,0.8458,1.9032,0.2223,0.6739,0.6175,4.319,4.4141,3.244,4.5364,0.2139,4.727,0.1101,2.4717,1.9187,4.5643,3.4774,3.0492,5.1942,3.621,5.306,5.6543,2.7833,2.0847,3.963,1.2722,1.3415,0.376,0.6363,0.0002,5.2402,3.4452,0.2183,1.2191,3.3064,0.5573,0.9835,4.212,6.5573,1.6065,5.2922,0.2242,1.1167,4.8766,3.6019,4.3804,1.9548,0.3093,0.1499,1.2686,5.096,1.8159,2.0048,0.0008,0.792,4.487,0.7987,2.8953,3.3093,2.0664,0.1203,2.5278,3.2119,1.543,2.0719,1.2807,0.0274,0.1507,2.7369,0.7532,0.3681,2.4419,2.4157,1.623,5.6628,0.8786,0.6828,0.9793,5.5931,3.3844,5.1154,4.0826,1.0821,2.785,3.6624,5.7919,2.7792,2.3684,1.8611,0.0136,0.3984,0.5738,1.2026,0.0002,2.408,0.0112,1.2678,4.5451,3.4418,2.2805,0.2182,0.9186,2.0023,0.0128,0.4062,1.9144,0.6026,0.0342,1.61,0.0041,0.0008,1.2783,0.7237,4.1917,2.9541,1.2974,1.197,1.004,2.3126,4.6591,5.9147,1.2307,0.8126]}

{"id":573,"ended":true,"length":237,"gen_text":"In October 1913, Innis started classes at McMaster University ( then in Toronto ). McMaster was a natural choice for him because it was a Baptist university and many students who attended Woodstock attended the university. His career began almost immediately as he worked as a teacher at the Presbyterian primary school in Winnipeg. In 1917 he also taught at McGill University in Montreal. In 1924 Innis returned to Winnipeg where he opened a school for young people where he began training young people for the clergy and teaching. He received a doctorate in theology and canon law in 1928 at Victoria College at the University of Manitoba, and became the new head of the school. The following year the school opened its own school of the ministry and he became Bishop of Winnipeg for eight years. He also served with the Canadian Union of Teachers in Saskatchewan for one year before resigning. Bishop Innis died in 1934 while in the midst of a bitter dispute with the Canadian Conference (later known as the Canadian Roman Catholic hierarchy) over the proposed appointment of Archbishop James White, who was not in full communion with the Church. Bishop Richard Innis was elected the fourth Bishop of Winnipeg in 1936. Bishop Innis is buried in the parish of St. James' Church in Winnipeg.","token_len":245,"entropy":[5.5813,8.3695,0.2718,12.444,0.9216,5.5465,9.5267,0.6295,8.7406,0.4753,4.3729,9.1139,5.5069,2.0729,1.9569,7.5764,1.0645,1.2654,7.7146,0.8348,1.0017,1.323,1.5723,1.279,0.5472,1.5079,10.1174,1.6271,1.4305,5.5713,2.9085,4.5493,1.7407,9.8573,3.819,1.7685,1.4547,1.1732,0.6063,4.0498,6.0359,3.2993,5.5103,0.251,3.5324,0.6132,3.7847,1.1124,0.2858,2.4346,1.3896,1.217,5.4704,5.3183,0.1702,1.0871,6.1785,1.4714,1.9332,2.8967,1.3218,6.2949,2.4659,0.7025,4.3165,0.2453,1.7066,0.025,1.3274,1.5508,3.6733,3.2378,0.0002,3.4373,0.0218,0.537,1.6139,0.0471,4.0084,0.7548,1.9151,0.5314,3.4019,1.3966,5.4041,0.1822,4.8154,4.4211,2.8842,1.234,2.0036,1.4767,4.5278,2.0984,2.469,1.036,1.8029,5.2022,1.0188,3.1129,0.1203,0.4993,2.5068,2.837,5.0563,0.038,1.5853,1.9912,2.9689,6.6827,0.6459,3.6089,0.6713,0.0897,0.0058,2.4438,2.7186,1.4522,2.8366,1.5972,5.8706,3.1052,0.1,0.2621,2.3205,0.6166,3.4043,2.2018,0.0388,3.5081,0.7814,2.6871,2.3598,1.3708,1.2703,2.3534,3.8815,2.7418,2.2884,3.4932,1.6377,6.6108,0.1533,1.0092,4.8657,4.142,0.0312,0.3105,2.0743,2.0634,1.1105,6.1834,0.362,2.3187,4.4086,0.0876,4.0061,2.1224,3.7859,2.7807,4.0867,0.0543,2.7019,3.3672,0.0008,2.4022,3.3099,0.0409,0.0004,2.6897,0.6044,4.9698,5.1415,2.8142,2.2525,2.3051,0.0017,0.9217,4.7831,1.0592,0.178,0.338,2.0724,1.7327,4.4133,3.2393,2.5451,0.0066,0.0482,0.9667,4.0526,0.0127,3.5477,0.5707,0.2393,0.8478,5.3501,3.4884,0.0383,3.1748,3.4498,4.9212,2.7315,1.1947,0.5803,3.4348,3.6353,4.2169,0.0998,0.0263,0.4453,2.2018,1.388,1.4852,7.7415,3.2279,0.0011,1.0512,3.3588,3.1742,3.5517,1.3789,0.0247,0.5144,0.6086,2.7474,0.4865,2.5821,0.1362,0.0001,3.1037,1.4907,0.4256,0.9032,3.759,1.5949,0.4849,0.0776,2.9578,3.5079,2.2207,1.1378,0.4963,0.6922]}

{"id":4010,"ended":true,"length":227,"gen_text":"Plasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized. A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one trip across its channel in a unit length of time. But many electrons travel through a channel in fractions of a second, and are therefore rarer than the high-speed electrons in the plasma.\n\nThis rapid change in direction is caused primarily by electrons and protons traveling away from each other and thus aligning.\n\nThe strong magnetic field and rapid change in orientation leads to plasma particles that spin counterclockwise or clockwise, respectively. The amount of spin will vary depending on the composition of the material and the concentration of electrons. Some charged particles are attracted to the magnetic field, the more so the stronger the field. Plasma ions will also spin clockwise more readily than negatively charged electrons.\n\nA plasma flow with little magnetic fields provides a natural environment that allows the creation of ion and neutral species, which flow with the circulating magnetic field. An abundance of the charged particles also helps achieve high temperatures during the plasma stage.\n\nHigh temperatures, or even explosions can also be achieved when a strong enough magnetic field is present.","token_len":246,"entropy":[4.1379,7.5988,2.2986,5.0386,0.3127,5.885,0.0058,0.0547,6.454,0.7275,3.9229,0.0444,1.7433,3.0911,0.1865,2.3457,5.3967,0.0034,0.4563,2.8856,0.8423,0.2917,3.3989,6.6098,10.7273,5.7901,2.1898,1.6432,1.5288,3.6219,6.5076,5.8555,7.4791,6.9716,0.2787,0.5383,4.7794,3.9513,4.0878,6.4596,1.4985,1.2109,4.7261,5.0386,0.1058,0.2376,0.6641,5.0934,4.9227,4.2009,3.3184,2.7199,1.9484,1.1257,1.6127,4.0415,0.0069,0.2169,0.1056,0.905,1.4415,4.4581,1.2029,5.8347,1.7765,0.7406,1.5119,5.7105,0.3337,2.3414,1.5272,3.1035,0.8634,1.8989,0.2914,1.8301,0.0015,3.7856,5.3889,4.0042,0.3942,3.5712,1.6518,3.3731,5.316,0.0248,3.972,3.7576,1.5445,0.0,4.5306,4.6559,0.0201,2.2487,0.0046,2.879,5.447,5.6662,0.0183,3.5675,3.0385,0.0002,1.7995,5.2775,0.3831,0.2444,4.4729,3.676,2.2086,0.1841,3.7505,5.5678,0.0853,4.3822,2.8926,2.159,4.8044,3.9034,0.2925,0.0009,3.4036,0.0988,0.0005,1.761,1.9127,0.3395,2.0238,5.4614,0.1201,0.5778,5.3192,2.0898,1.3561,0.0743,0.2592,4.5126,0.1237,0.0487,4.2538,1.7894,0.6442,5.1953,0.0457,1.6075,1.3084,4.731,5.2856,0.1167,2.0739,3.2446,0.1814,0.6107,1.226,0.0431,1.1653,6.579,2.1891,0.7734,0.496,1.4713,0.0992,0.9224,0.3924,5.183,5.8102,3.0998,1.6236,1.9156,1.657,0.0035,7.1902,2.114,0.3163,4.1816,0.0374,2.8008,0.501,0.4851,0.0002,3.3623,1.7919,5.1322,3.4604,5.5171,2.4629,3.229,6.1027,0.9689,4.65,2.7061,4.0128,2.0273,1.8571,3.0871,0.0441,4.0535,5.317,1.8656,5.1652,2.0013,1.5164,4.9717,3.015,0.8151,6.6751,1.9335,0.1127,0.3998,4.8172,5.0301,0.0045,4.1285,2.1901,0.4383,3.9666,3.1039,6.046,3.1899,3.0413,5.6949,0.8176,1.3014,3.1184,0.6372,0.6584,0.0002,4.7996,2.1029,3.1816,3.9901,3.9552,2.7082,4.2319,3.1023,1.1892,1.7338,2.8101,2.2183,2.7779,2.9118,0.3229,0.006,0.296,1.1394,0.4061]}

As a result of the accident, a government commission in Sweden launched an investigation. The aircraft was sold to a company that manufactured the airplane, and later to the 'Lobster' maker of an identical model.

As part of the change, however, the minimum payout amount was doubled, so some of the smaller employees who had previously made more than the minimum wage (around $600) were now getting less as a result.","token_len":247,"entropy":[2.1332,2.2482,5.2616,0.8484,0.533,1.5353,5.5838,0.105,0.0275,0.0907,12.6191,2.5351,3.2631,11.1511,0.1195,1.4119,10.0955,5.1582,0.5799,2.7897,0.0686,7.3221,7.6692,11.7056,2.0279,0.6293,8.5455,1.2984,0.1146,4.2679,3.1907,4.1057,0.1015,0.1302,1.2261,1.4362,1.247,1.7132,0.0211,3.7542,0.0378,0.0153,2.7355,1.0689,0.0276,0.0113,0.0079,1.6111,9.4081,5.3734,4.1216,3.2781,3.5192,7.9214,6.9476,4.2201,5.5551,3.0861,0.1548,3.141,4.536,0.0538,0.2379,1.3035,2.8475,1.6045,5.1261,2.6681,2.0836,2.2664,3.1018,3.6827,2.508,2.1249,3.9515,0.089,5.7636,3.3752,2.1571,1.1737,2.108,5.5207,3.6084,4.4419,5.159,1.1985,1.6866,0.6733,4.5861,1.2541,3.0249,0.153,0.6307,5.2059,1.1198,0.3751,3.6999,4.269,2.9436,3.3377,2.0362,2.5072,2.5018,1.6771,2.3737,1.3759,0.2234,0.727,0.0002,4.89,0.5504,1.5144,0.1093,0.5902,2.5579,0.9798,0.16,3.3179,0.217,0.3663,0.8667,3.8875,5.2618,4.9721,2.3549,0.7138,2.6285,0.2423,3.1866,0.7006,5.6045,3.0534,0.4901,1.2188,2.0145,2.6846,1.2323,4.1559,3.128,0.8737,0.0897,5.3241,3.6534,0.7889,4.6016,5.5132,3.4335,2.5802,1.7484,0.7235,0.1738,1.1201,0.9124,0.0528,0.2703,5.7539,4.2571,0.0831,3.4653,0.3978,2.9847,6.3883,1.6597,1.65,0.8531,5.4483,1.5944,0.9628,1.8105,4.2491,5.8895,6.4407,5.9482,0.2785,0.5194,1.2006,7.0919,1.0806,0.537,0.0002,3.7789,2.4724,2.0875,4.2738,2.7777,6.4294,0.5703,0.1125,2.0717,3.6235,4.5797,0.8413,0.344,1.7102,0.7785,2.2264,0.2816,2.1303,4.9107,4.1657,3.9169,0.0081,1.0144,4.1653,3.7869,0.0033,0.7603,3.1855,0.372,6.5235,0.0069,0.4676,0.76,1.9783,0.8399,0.3815,5.3169,1.8443,3.0729,6.9638,2.5173,0.1341,3.9494,3.3458,2.062,1.035,1.7542,2.5504,3.6142,0.2682,0.7621,0.8425,0.4119,3.1957,5.1057,0.7223,2.5698,1.4522,1.3087,0.8617,3.8896,1.5267,4.6201,0.6588,0.149,0.7223]}

Today however, the state flag has a second coat of arms on the outside, which resembles the heraldry of the state.

A few months later, however, some of the other members of the Lough Mask gang were given a lighter sentence for their part in plotting the assassination of Earl Grey.","token_len":248,"entropy":[8.9293,2.7902,8.4264,0.4184,10.6203,3.8586,2.7139,4.8457,3.956,0.5053,2.5441,5.7682,5.7595,1.8726,6.285,1.5271,6.3614,3.2303,6.7704,5.896,1.246,3.517,0.0036,0.1437,8.3187,0.0315,4.6538,0.1779,1.2354,3.7493,7.7744,4.3113,0.5686,2.1784,0.9586,0.5181,3.125,1.5517,1.253,5.9509,0.6336,0.4559,5.1288,3.4087,3.3376,0.0019,0.0084,0.004,2.9871,2.2096,4.2779,5.2635,5.4656,2.0588,2.8653,0.0965,7.4833,1.9752,1.1598,5.3277,1.8696,1.4527,0.5363,0.3837,0.2943,2.8771,5.2521,0.4173,2.6929,1.1452,3.7321,1.5644,0.9884,0.0068,0.7125,2.662,1.8804,0.2864,2.7253,1.3216,0.0037,0.0089,0.3079,2.814,1.3882,2.1359,2.8446,0.9246,0.0121,0.8603,2.6491,0.0127,3.0257,2.0907,3.8443,5.9041,4.4369,3.9748,3.6465,0.6552,0.1152,1.5468,2.288,1.2636,0.0051,1.8889,2.922,4.7115,0.4561,3.9171,1.7625,4.2836,3.4526,0.4078,0.843,2.011,2.1864,4.7216,1.6213,0.8816,1.0272,1.5828,0.4432,4.0709,1.8804,5.7129,0.9738,0.0003,4.6022,0.0121,0.7535,3.4685,0.5704,2.764,2.5165,0.6864,0.2005,2.962,0.0345,3.5371,1.6517,0.4535,0.4674,1.4799,4.3106,0.1615,5.1627,4.5783,0.0001,1.2984,3.8436,1.4147,1.3777,3.1672,5.2156,0.7102,5.329,2.4876,0.0513,0.979,0.3638,3.1214,1.2486,0.6478,0.6131,0.0002,2.4388,2.8779,1.2931,0.734,1.4233,3.5307,2.1827,0.4271,0.1715,0.022,5.7153,3.0578,1.1135,0.1649,2.6901,3.1025,0.265,0.4956,0.0075,0.2348,1.9116,1.6008,1.5644,0.6079,3.0117,5.4234,3.324,4.1519,2.0283,0.2826,3.4157,1.951,3.855,4.992,4.6194,3.9089,0.3143,1.2654,2.7152,0.0144,3.4954,1.0748,2.6653,0.9285,0.1993,6.651,0.197,4.4998,3.2418,1.0185,0.0973,0.4559,2.7057,0.002,6.3802,1.0803,1.1662,4.6111,2.435,0.0205,0.1995,3.3999,0.0057,0.0156,2.2293,0.6656,3.7487,2.6076,3.6026,0.1112,1.4222,1.6076,0.6758,0.0127,6.0109,1.4182,2.6196,0.1229,5.4444,1.9623,0.8434]}

Al Shabaab released a statement regarding the capture on Twitter.","token_len":248,"entropy":[5.7567,3.3043,0.1648,11.3687,2.5498,2.6619,3.7014,0.1154,0.0001,5.0286,1.2682,5.1048,1.8621,0.2365,1.2019,0.0,0.0001,3.3967,9.3312,0.1418,11.7912,14.2122,9.7905,9.4982,3.8898,3.9042,0.9619,0.3827,9.0598,11.92,1.1222,11.5626,5.9826,6.5392,9.3095,0.9576,5.3557,5.0352,3.3627,3.9139,0.2896,0.2031,2.2185,3.3428,0.9551,0.7167,0.0182,2.9841,0.0009,0.0007,2.327,0.9151,2.8445,5.5575,4.4842,0.7976,5.9919,0.5564,6.1329,0.5306,0.945,6.4767,1.1772,0.0217,0.0003,5.8024,0.4921,1.4405,0.0068,3.3323,1.7876,3.525,0.5197,4.4213,6.5557,0.0072,0.3556,5.7897,0.0011,0.0055,1.5283,3.1047,2.7555,3.3731,1.3531,2.1556,0.0948,0.9356,0.1772,0.7658,1.8665,1.166,5.8182,2.1018,1.8705,4.9459,2.7867,1.8794,2.9007,0.8473,3.3459,0.0162,0.0052,0.0005,4.3927,1.3455,3.8962,0.0042,0.0015,1.2408,3.2764,0.5678,0.1641,1.4745,0.7787,2.5831,4.898,1.4298,1.7334,2.9987,0.9322,1.716,3.3921,0.0711,3.6749,4.3241,1.0182,1.6076,0.1568,0.9204,0.9281,6.0335,2.0319,4.2755,3.5371,0.2072,6.2609,2.2747,5.4826,4.3644,1.5015,0.2197,1.2063,1.02,3.3021,1.6632,0.8998,2.9884,0.8236,0.3109,0.3817,3.7738,0.1221,2.1353,4.7621,0.2178,0.3112,0.0154,2.4009,4.6448,1.264,2.955,1.5302,1.6205,3.0737,5.2427,1.87,3.0279,2.6235,1.6785,0.1099,0.0002,2.4724,0.0233,0.0046,0.0003,1.8493,4.4123,0.3255,0.5499,0.0005,0.0001,2.2023,5.5792,2.4518,0.855,2.2648,4.206,0.7444,3.2801,3.15,0.0112,0.0352,0.0584,2.6215,0.7783,4.6613,3.7851,1.3019,3.0454,0.5933,2.9437,1.5243,0.6532,2.5244,3.1419,0.026,0.0054,0.0001,0.609,2.7498,1.2302,0.4474,0.0,3.7238,0.7641,0.0128,0.0138,2.1267,1.4144,0.8605,4.6817,0.0441,1.0352,0.9853,2.0356,0.2815,0.8446,2.8051,0.9258,1.5584,0.0003,0.0,0.4898,2.8818,0.0127,0.0039,0.0001,2.4363,0.2839,0.9608,5.4786,0.392,0.2685,4.6484,3.274,1.4126]}

In the late 1970s she moved to California and ran a music shop. In 1980 She worked as a singer in an LA club called the Vibe. As a singer she was asked to be the group's backup singer, which she refused, because Lennon thought she was too young to deal with the stress of the group.

[8] Nonetheless, Disney found itself more than willing to take the critical hits, even as some critics viewed Rapunzel as a waste of time and money, considering the franchise never lived up to its expectations, and that the character was also the victim of a studio marketing campaign that ultimately produced a film with a less-than-stellar box office.\nSarina Anderman - The Guardian","token_len":251,"entropy":[4.5457,7.1671,3.4738,3.1777,0.3396,5.5624,0.7293,11.2075,2.3948,0.0006,1.8468,2.7374,8.7015,0.4303,3.2315,0.0747,0.0052,3.1361,13.239,8.6092,0.0635,3.6928,1.3258,3.001,0.2076,10.0184,13.6182,5.9321,0.0202,0.0528,0.0068,5.6924,3.6074,1.9866,8.4078,10.8578,1.6273,4.5637,0.3394,0.5332,10.4436,8.8383,7.849,1.044,0.002,0.0007,0.0818,0.2245,1.9914,5.6488,1.1568,5.6536,0.26,1.4334,1.3423,2.8666,0.1924,1.6015,3.6852,0.0524,1.3113,4.2182,2.3309,2.6049,4.2461,0.9225,4.2083,0.0045,4.0541,3.2666,5.2472,5.9637,0.4518,0.6677,0.3921,2.2928,4.1593,2.6586,2.6301,0.5792,4.3516,3.6163,0.7773,4.8135,4.2763,0.0296,6.008,4.0547,0.0926,2.6348,2.4006,4.2106,0.2912,2.3692,0.3125,0.0007,0.0011,0.1147,0.2132,5.5728,3.5226,1.3525,4.1616,0.6586,0.0164,6.1094,1.6173,4.8413,5.2564,0.5087,2.3666,3.4459,3.1091,3.6998,2.1068,0.0942,1.8736,5.4911,0.5613,0.8815,1.3156,4.0342,3.7546,3.0409,0.0001,0.4908,1.4581,6.0609,0.0423,0.0143,0.0274,1.8453,6.7456,2.4877,5.8549,0.0265,0.1849,1.5632,4.7164,4.731,0.7987,0.4757,0.4653,3.3187,5.8184,0.9717,2.9545,0.0031,0.0022,4.6767,4.6154,1.1701,0.1327,4.6249,1.4603,0.3527,0.4352,3.5909,3.2088,3.2019,1.8436,5.7865,3.5632,0.232,1.6398,2.3996,5.2455,4.5894,0.7356,0.1325,0.0207,0.0048,6.2217,0.0143,1.778,5.8636,2.5797,6.1686,0.3429,1.6447,0.0127,2.7294,1.371,6.0326,2.7905,2.3254,3.2135,1.8122,3.9024,1.4664,4.707,1.1494,0.0009,0.0006,0.2071,0.8781,4.7522,0.0278,1.0656,1.3224,0.4764,2.5294,5.7677,1.2864,5.522,6.2544,4.6782,0.0032,0.007,0.7227,3.5801,2.9265,0.9353,2.5163,1.0561,2.1598,0.9908,5.7016,4.1017,2.5964,0.0063,1.4057,4.987,3.301,1.2916,0.3561,5.4758,4.6703,0.9485,2.1436,2.7666,1.5348,3.9218,0.7052,0.0181,0.0073,0.9154,0.9767,0.2404,1.4404,2.0154,9.1931,3.4797,2.8521,5.6874,3.2701,1.0621,4.5443,3.2093,5.9163]}

In late 1945, the troops of the 1st Battalion were returned to Australia. As a result more than 80% of the personnel in the battalion were killed overseas.\nDuring the early decades of the 21st century, the name of the battalion changed to 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the Australian Grenadier Regiment. This name change occurred because the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Australian and New Zealand Regiment was not considered to be ready to fight in World War II.","token_len":252,"entropy":[5.5682,6.6534,0.2685,10.003,3.9554,0.1493,1.3461,6.1732,2.2699,6.2222,7.7476,8.2657,1.0611,2.262,0.2388,0.5108,3.7559,0.2551,2.9106,2.2159,1.6568,1.3371,2.1371,3.2103,0.1071,0.882,2.7245,1.081,0.0021,0.3528,7.9006,5.6714,2.1288,0.341,2.5589,2.3867,7.2307,0.2065,2.1942,4.9974,2.0537,4.4729,1.6611,3.7656,0.0598,1.1597,4.4071,1.5686,0.002,5.4504,2.8475,5.3049,0.4674,4.642,0.8071,0.0366,1.5587,0.2597,5.4548,4.4727,4.3642,0.18,2.7445,3.5602,3.7189,0.9854,1.3198,1.0417,10.3056,5.4308,3.4523,1.9633,1.3008,5.8227,0.5539,0.4633,3.8712,0.0687,1.5477,1.8861,0.6122,1.729,1.0315,3.9139,0.2616,4.9019,3.1665,5.5546,4.8779,0.5689,0.0002,4.6015,2.0035,0.9511,5.4053,1.848,1.6757,3.2442,2.7093,4.2021,2.5284,0.6654,3.6133,1.7738,1.7512,4.9302,0.2534,1.3425,1.6133,0.0278,3.9669,3.3963,1.4109,0.1297,0.8932,0.5308,0.0002,0.8176,2.359,4.0623,0.7052,5.2576,2.221,1.2757,1.8178,4.9014,0.2964,0.1159,3.2047,0.3026,2.146,0.0016,0.2711,0.4434,2.5338,2.4136,3.9759,5.4571,0.0443,0.1859,0.4333,0.0781,0.0546,0.7652,2.0701,0.3952,5.604,0.0087,0.1943,1.5343,3.1034,3.5239,1.5901,0.6254,0.9481,5.162,1.6564,0.1068,0.4461,0.036,0.0556,0.4179,3.2539,0.0994,0.8039,1.2514,4.6474,1.9079,0.5781,8.1365,0.431,4.415,1.6488,0.0256,0.1785,4.2675,2.8967,0.1262,1.029,0.7664,3.5963,6.1271,0.6301,0.9803,4.0914,0.4357,3.5799,5.8396,0.0552,0.2427,2.4217,0.0677,0.3416,0.5372,0.7001,4.2836,0.4617,0.1844,2.037,3.0395,0.8659,2.3594,0.441,0.7248,1.9174,0.1493,1.3273,0.2144,0.2771,2.1112,1.8953,3.3671,0.0534,0.2628,0.9403,0.1291,2.486,6.3632,0.6539,2.4809,0.3104,4.2933,1.648,2.7545,2.3275,2.5844,0.7521,4.0665,0.0427,0.254,0.8403,0.046,1.565,0.1319,5.0439,0.0029,0.0013,2.5079,0.8522,4.376,3.2489,1.5446,0.2022,5.5829,1.0822,1.541,1.3212,1.8679,0.0049,0.4709,0.4945]}

In the US, the trailer was screened on HBO at the Sundance film festival with Tim League attending.\n\nIn 2007, the trailer received an Emmy Award nomination, winning Best Make-up & Hairstyling for its makeup effects, and Best Music for its music composition.\n\nIn late 2007, it was announced that, as well as the full film, the sequel would also have a video game adaptation.\n\nIn 2008, the trailer was released for the game, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem for a Face.","token_len":253,"entropy":[9.2173,7.3623,2.0093,7.4494,2.7306,4.5242,1.595,1.9726,0.4564,0.2522,0.0335,1.1118,0.8353,2.0952,1.9086,0.1487,3.5158,0.9901,0.716,1.5803,1.2539,0.4339,11.7843,6.1766,6.9819,2.7878,0.0008,1.3674,2.5478,2.2166,4.2118,0.4891,0.064,7.6155,4.908,3.5406,1.2982,12.0191,0.0483,5.985,0.0256,0.0108,0.1874,1.1453,1.4139,0.0033,4.1019,0.9519,5.0174,1.7019,4.9778,1.4111,0.5138,1.7292,2.8621,3.8563,1.6159,2.0231,1.2952,0.4662,1.8735,0.843,1.6702,0.7528,5.4234,0.5215,5.3751,0.1644,4.7048,4.6178,1.0437,5.9048,1.8995,3.5023,1.2035,5.3098,0.444,1.4651,3.4593,2.9285,0.8586,0.4071,3.3829,4.9864,0.8367,2.0355,1.8922,5.8585,0.1665,1.5603,5.197,3.1035,2.6637,0.7733,13.5027,6.798,6.3888,9.2418,0.6618,2.9861,5.677,0.669,3.1952,1.2666,1.583,6.4755,3.7197,2.2693,0.0001,3.1727,4.1071,1.5151,2.2341,3.0534,0.0477,3.0062,4.01,4.699,1.4807,2.5293,1.8569,3.4732,3.5707,2.8748,1.2698,0.3658,2.2705,0.1178,0.0121,4.3809,2.2474,2.6014,3.023,0.143,0.0058,0.588,0.844,0.5811,1.0613,5.3677,0.1076,1.2981,0.1403,3.273,1.7352,2.245,1.1125,1.3118,2.518,0.4986,2.3663,1.92,3.0865,3.1703,0.4763,3.0288,0.0003,2.774,0.0404,5.9115,6.018,2.2076,5.9644,1.2584,1.2712,0.0002,2.1867,4.2092,0.4432,1.4034,1.6646,4.5814,1.8578,2.8408,1.198,0.4342,3.2866,2.3642,1.7506,3.2274,1.8424,1.3686,3.1055,0.3641,0.0001,0.0072,0.0023,0.7658,3.5614,3.5051,1.5596,2.3682,1.144,1.6061,3.3511,1.032,0.9419,1.203,3.9277,0.4425,0.8123,0.0002,1.4845,5.1627,1.7694,0.2422,2.2686,0.2438,1.2024,0.0892,5.7464,2.8924,2.7234,0.0062,1.394,4.5328,2.5139,0.2203,1.4056,3.915,0.9812,1.7472,3.366,0.6153,4.7472,0.2028,4.1802,0.8076,1.7659,0.0002,1.3407,1.779,0.1103,1.3789,1.5518,0.4476,1.5942,1.9614,0.4407,3.4729,1.8194,3.7002,0.8982,0.7005,0.0051,1.1226,0.6795,0.0001,3.4027,0.3199,4.8886,3.3429]}
{"id":2203,"ended":true,"length":237,"gen_text":"One of the reasons for the increase in the numbers of skyscrapers during the period was the growth in demand for office workers. In part this demand was fuelled by many US firms becoming more selective about the size of their employees since they were generally able to pay workers a wage which did not require them to have a college degree.\n\nThis trend accelerated in the 1980s, as employers tried to keep costs down by opening up more offices and reducing the cost of office space. As a result, many of the tallest buildings on the globe were built during this period. However, it is interesting to ponder the likely impact of the 1980s slump on the construction of skyscrapers. To this day, the collapse in the US stock market has caused a dramatic fall in property prices. This will likely cause a period of further decline in office tower prices, making skyscrapers a less attractive investment.\n\nThe financial markets also played a large role in the formation of some of the tallest skyscrapers. In the late 1980s there was a boom in the financial markets which stimulated interest in some of the tallest buildings. Since the late 1970s, there has been a decrease in the average price for office buildings in some regions, making such buildings more lucrative.","token_len":253,"entropy":[1.2901,0.3166,3.5079,2.3618,1.021,4.1213,0.3897,1.8461,4.4512,0.2787,11.8866,0.0689,0.0018,5.673,0.2466,4.1302,2.0169,0.5815,4.1943,1.0263,3.4434,0.3133,1.2125,8.5281,0.9033,2.1169,6.499,1.9396,4.0963,0.5093,2.7835,0.0119,7.4716,5.6987,2.1874,5.1484,1.349,5.6926,1.0657,1.9306,5.2669,0.3165,0.1849,4.5676,5.5593,1.6538,1.1206,5.4545,2.8929,0.0056,2.8094,3.9556,2.1498,3.8185,2.4272,4.3906,0.0028,2.5794,1.2982,0.0058,3.5046,1.1413,1.8116,0.1661,0.2525,1.4762,0.0064,3.4028,2.5237,4.3033,1.2151,0.1217,1.8819,0.0352,1.8631,2.0,4.6438,4.1247,0.0255,3.5115,2.0051,0.1954,1.0674,5.5546,1.8762,1.887,1.8736,1.7855,3.7514,0.7558,4.6863,0.0262,1.3785,0.5756,0.3423,2.9201,0.6499,0.0708,0.5257,2.7556,2.0614,0.1899,2.9238,0.7811,4.6998,0.313,4.0264,0.935,0.7519,1.1274,0.3168,0.2367,0.3155,4.1074,0.1069,3.0752,1.4188,3.9492,0.0782,8.2626,1.8169,5.8453,1.6709,0.37,1.1546,5.4758,0.039,4.6797,0.4961,0.4609,3.0953,0.1217,1.3435,0.0102,0.0002,0.9979,5.5124,4.0571,1.7827,0.448,1.221,4.6829,1.9006,0.6981,1.9777,1.9421,0.1275,2.2435,3.7222,1.4909,3.5061,1.9632,0.0291,4.5096,0.5562,1.7846,2.3223,3.9943,2.479,2.7941,1.0646,5.7678,0.0193,4.5603,3.4148,0.0691,1.2572,4.6114,3.2594,1.5135,4.0031,2.8843,0.3413,0.0025,3.1641,0.6994,0.196,0.4427,0.8809,0.475,0.0002,2.0688,5.6313,4.8149,2.6535,2.914,0.2218,2.8782,0.6195,0.0839,0.5023,5.9993,0.0583,6.1348,0.3274,0.0901,0.7398,0.6321,0.0074,0.0002,0.6915,1.6925,0.811,1.8422,0.8618,0.0052,4.4232,0.2576,0.3729,2.8331,0.0235,1.2827,3.1556,0.5676,2.1503,5.3386,3.8125,0.1284,5.8298,0.5316,0.0622,0.9388,0.8892,1.1972,4.5367,1.1541,2.9434,2.0335,0.0036,0.7223,2.6973,0.9169,0.0752,0.2434,5.4571,0.0056,0.6855,4.5949,2.6962,2.779,0.6466,2.0726,1.7929,3.9418,3.9271,2.1088,3.3899,5.0754,0.5411,0.8012,6.2697,1.1152]}

During the height of mating season, the entire male population are all male cocks. But these days we have a female-only population with all the females having the rare & valuable genetic trait for being able to have male reproduction. With the rare cocks on the run, the females become more plentiful, and the male population decreases. The males just have nowhere to lay their eggs and they have to compete for the smaller and more abundant females. This happens for about 2 years. The females will always try to breed with the best of the males, but eventually they will get a male who is good enough to have a nice chick.\n\n\nFor any cocks you see on the road, the more rare they are, the less they will mate with the female.

Usually the male won't even touch the chick, or even try.\n\n\nBut when a cocks does breed, it produces a few sweet looking pups.","token_len":254,"entropy":[7.1971,4.2869,7.4484,3.9222,10.8188,7.8665,7.2644,8.5049,3.1599,6.0722,1.3339,4.8441,2.3251,1.6844,0.8484,7.886,12.0142,11.2155,2.0946,0.4527,3.6365,2.197,2.7882,2.8754,6.1888,4.2615,3.3487,0.2079,4.5304,2.7993,1.3066,6.2304,0.8621,7.9767,0.0148,3.3853,0.2869,0.5374,1.5981,5.1812,3.6859,0.8288,5.5177,4.7711,4.1475,3.9061,0.0188,0.7944,5.4169,4.9905,2.7011,5.1415,1.4924,1.5307,2.6212,4.0021,0.6826,0.4241,4.6327,4.2393,1.1583,2.2394,3.2956,2.9998,5.0675,5.8621,3.68,4.2741,1.5103,4.3031,2.8774,1.2768,0.0077,4.3996,4.309,6.1726,0.5581,6.2539,1.5256,3.6066,4.6352,0.1155,4.8877,0.541,4.1551,0.5011,1.1521,1.387,4.7288,2.5614,5.0815,1.807,0.5992,1.2619,2.3617,0.5826,3.2898,0.5128,2.3981,2.6271,5.6515,2.9479,4.8971,0.1686,3.7424,0.1584,0.045,2.7466,2.8148,3.4846,0.912,3.8106,0.969,1.3939,6.0041,3.6276,1.6648,1.6288,0.3303,0.3384,2.6637,5.339,3.787,1.9771,2.2323,1.0476,1.4368,2.2408,2.0125,3.0449,5.2242,4.1168,0.1122,3.224,0.5181,0.6636,3.7705,3.1645,0.2629,1.1717,0.6767,0.9965,3.6543,1.2341,0.8141,3.0176,2.7992,1.8544,2.1393,0.9189,2.8421,0.4798,0.7159,2.8954,1.3485,4.8053,4.422,0.8302,4.0254,0.0002,5.0039,5.3974,2.5624,0.0616,2.9533,1.3125,2.5856,0.3266,0.9161,0.4198,3.7079,4.7688,2.5208,1.5898,0.0465,0.251,0.0301,2.5345,2.1208,1.0709,3.5597,0.5418,1.397,3.5597,0.7351,2.8543,0.6066,1.6512,1.4551,2.6091,5.6363,1.3921,5.5609,2.0808,1.158,0.9586,0.0014,4.11,4.2156,5.062,0.6162,0.7356,1.9265,0.0002,2.7661,1.8925,2.8006,3.7268,2.8614,1.3136,2.9178,2.4843,0.0054,3.2596,0.6194,1.694,3.2573,2.6265,3.6766,0.8007,5.0658,2.2156,2.9059,5.508,0.0225,1.7784,4.7896,0.8583,0.8508,1.3784,3.0786,2.5248,2.122,1.7771,2.3814,0.0003,3.7791,3.8829,2.7978,1.8798,0.3236,2.1558,3.2692,0.6031,1.3731,3.8015,0.7379,4.5585,5.8774,2.2359,5.032,0.0202,0.6575]}

Morrow took Fossett up on his offer, traveling from America to Nepal and attempting the summit.\n\nHe died on the mountain, and his remains were picked up and placed in Mount Everest Base Camp on May 22, 2001.

Some characters like Principal Skinner, Principal Chorus, the Bart Gang, Mr. Burns, Mrs. Krabappel, Lisa Simpson, and a multitude of school children became household names with the addition of them appearing in The Simpsons.\nFrom 2005 - 2015, The Simpsons Reruns aired on TBS in the weekdays and the Saturday afternoons, with some of the series' best episodes appearing throughout Season 28, with a great number of Simpsons voice actors appearing. As of 2016, the show is now produced by Netflix.","token_len":255,"entropy":[8.5425,4.3892,2.5625,3.9344,2.6523,6.8532,2.5084,1.1791,1.652,9.7993,3.4781,0.1519,7.0085,4.8172,1.6128,0.1097,1.6725,5.5859,0.0026,4.6864,7.8075,2.0677,5.2995,0.08,7.926,1.1078,1.4133,0.6918,4.4105,1.6639,3.9714,11.2106,1.9479,6.3894,1.4449,1.2209,1.9043,0.5872,3.7783,0.2271,2.9135,2.6253,1.3789,3.0717,0.9597,1.6125,0.1217,0.0057,4.199,0.029,1.6341,2.2349,2.1013,5.8006,5.035,0.6524,4.1754,3.3683,5.7937,0.9122,1.8831,0.9569,3.8997,3.4534,1.6534,0.6352,2.2861,4.2946,1.8142,1.1562,4.2004,1.0731,5.4775,0.0046,0.192,4.5934,3.3563,1.862,0.0019,0.7104,4.5853,3.2657,0.3675,2.1138,2.8116,3.1273,1.6103,5.7777,0.7923,3.9074,0.0873,6.3231,0.8572,1.8279,2.1327,5.103,3.1284,1.5656,5.2247,4.7938,3.1802,5.1843,0.3168,0.9224,1.8035,3.9366,0.2337,6.6323,3.9619,1.1607,0.6844,0.0035,0.3369,2.1046,3.2123,0.0497,2.9361,3.0188,4.1737,1.7344,5.6413,3.5642,3.5641,5.6729,3.0291,1.5038,1.6389,0.0999,3.1921,1.4021,0.1633,1.7864,4.9986,0.0209,3.7661,0.0384,4.6336,3.0672,2.2033,4.2849,2.2811,5.0461,0.6813,0.8922,3.1501,0.2403,4.917,5.8664,3.9117,3.3872,0.0071,1.1984,2.3375,1.7382,2.8058,0.4696,3.9546,3.6785,6.131,0.3819,2.9006,0.1566,0.1082,0.2814,4.3842,0.009,0.1549,0.0006,0.001,0.0041,0.2602,3.7988,1.3918,0.3001,1.0388,4.5556,4.0572,0.0213,6.9624,1.9427,3.9169,2.3919,0.0462,4.732,1.3121,3.4747,0.038,4.911,5.754,0.8211,2.1942,0.0607,1.3691,0.8936,5.5357,5.5205,3.8367,3.0992,0.3866,1.0228,0.0261,0.9555,0.0009,0.0782,2.1643,1.2161,4.9128,0.0425,2.7512,0.6871,4.2833,0.8986,3.5128,3.2707,2.7556,2.7229,0.0136,0.0003,2.0366,2.0619,4.2384,2.5997,0.2518,4.0286,0.5055,2.0607,0.9767,3.3685,4.1546,5.5154,5.5729,2.0201,3.0907,2.7686,5.1728,2.5271,0.1833,4.4539,5.8298,0.1343,2.1617,2.369,4.9545,1.3405,2.412,0.1378,1.0611,0.7393,1.3677,2.6016,3.2566,0.5271,5.1251,1.1675]}

However, with the exception of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia ( 1831 ) and U.S. v. Oregon (1857 ) (hereafter referred to simply as treaties ), virtually all other claims on the basis of aboriginal title in the United States in the time of its early development were denied. In the early years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, aboriginal and treaties claims were brought to the courts, and most of these were settled out of court (1848\u20131856). But these courts did have the advantage of having some experience of hearing claims of this type. This fact would later prove decisive on a number of key occasions. In particular, such claims proved decisive in defining the parameters of the Indian Treaty Tribes Act, which was drafted in 1855 (at Indian Treaties Act Cases in U.S. Court:1852\u20131857). However, the Indian Removal Act and the Indian Removal Act of 1883 also had significant effects on aboriginal and treaty rights during the second half of the nineteenth century.

Ulysses makes his way through the vast ocean, but he makes it 'by clinging to the ship.'\n\n\u2014 As part of his heroic effort, he also has to endure many harsh tortures.\n\n\u2014 A portmanteau of the Latin 'immenes' and 'immortal,' meaning 'unliving.'","token_len":255,"entropy":[9.2316,12.8392,0.022,9.3293,0.0575,1.5755,7.2216,3.4386,0.0006,3.2804,2.2702,7.5216,5.6386,6.0948,0.9561,9.823,2.7589,6.1706,0.2286,2.9661,0.001,0.0001,1.4242,3.8669,3.6865,3.487,3.5134,3.7026,2.3612,6.9537,1.8977,2.9924,1.4584,5.4702,3.0012,0.0002,0.0001,4.8324,7.7974,0.0267,0.004,0.0015,3.7649,1.4158,2.3969,0.734,0.8067,2.8423,5.5345,2.3428,0.6328,1.8631,0.0017,0.0019,0.8756,1.2591,0.0294,2.181,5.0041,0.2815,1.6631,4.0064,4.3573,3.0731,0.9337,4.5488,0.4004,0.2407,3.2536,1.8734,0.6729,1.9439,0.0017,0.0004,1.6656,1.5854,5.2211,0.0759,0.0002,0.7482,3.178,1.8814,4.5514,1.4037,2.9317,2.8878,2.099,5.6847,0.0385,0.0231,1.6734,1.2854,2.1286,1.9913,4.4783,0.4062,3.4767,2.2457,1.6062,0.1957,2.1076,0.8942,4.9896,3.6617,1.9175,3.5589,0.7889,0.5262,1.2489,0.7832,2.4351,0.1139,5.4876,3.6425,5.5365,1.5592,2.1276,5.3214,0.8493,1.2938,3.4502,0.0246,0.0001,0.0009,0.1553,0.807,6.0653,3.613,5.5288,1.352,0.2006,0.8942,0.0032,0.0389,0.0515,0.0157,0.2788,1.1204,0.5848,3.0432,0.2512,0.8035,0.8463,3.1631,0.056,5.1077,1.0912,0.0459,1.9321,2.5481,0.8076,3.1694,2.6154,3.3839,1.3195,4.0324,1.076,0.8197,4.3449,2.7066,3.8253,0.8897,0.0001,0.8207,3.5633,3.3378,3.3191,3.8578,1.0579,0.3556,2.2582,4.2348,3.9685,1.2492,0.1926,4.1624,1.9138,0.0493,1.3723,0.7917,0.9022,0.1222,7.6351,3.7946,3.8227,0.4819,4.6892,0.0091,0.0007,4.3766,0.2522,0.1413,0.9897,0.6426,4.6221,1.448,2.1316,3.1287,1.7497,3.9631,0.8561,5.2363,2.0126,6.2102,0.1824,1.0473,3.6387,1.5303,0.5374,0.0001,0.2282,5.8795,5.0922,0.0018,1.1233,4.6759,4.3681,0.6345,1.921,4.9186,3.4598,0.2196,2.4645,2.2868,5.9858,5.2576,0.0038,1.2328,0.518,0.0001,0.1831,2.9576,3.7434,0.0016,0.0002,0.0003,0.2196,0.4403,1.769,0.8219,5.391,4.5756,2.4425,0.3923,0.7991,0.8341,2.9839,0.5244,2.1908,1.9418,0.251,3.1507,3.4552,0.5378]}

It slowly strengthened and became Tropical Storm Diane on August 9. After a Fujiwhara interaction with the center over the Lesser Antilles, Diane produced a tropical depression on August 16. It formed a new satellite named Camilo on August 26.\n\nForecasts\n\nThere is a large risk of major impacts on land with storm surge up to 7 feet during times of low barometric pressure. The strongest impacts will go away quickly and will mostly affect southern and eastern Africa. However, it could take up to four days for some impacts to dissipate. On the other hand, more powerful impacts could extend farther inland with coastal flooding. Rainfall totals are likely to be small with rainfall rates on August 16 and 17 going as high as 6\" with a large chance of localized rainshowers. Tropical Storm Diane was associated with the warm water off the coast of Indonesia during the week, increasing the overall sea surface temperatures. As part of its hybrid nature, Diane also has a large circulation that pulls moisture into the atmosphere from the Gulf of Mexico. This means that while Diane was forecast as a dangerous storm on Wednesday, its impacts will depend a great deal on conditions inland.","token_len":256,"entropy":[10.2496,6.0238,6.9156,2.8091,3.2002,0.9002,7.631,1.3855,4.4615,0.0026,0.0027,0.001,0.1133,5.204,0.3065,0.0026,3.2669,3.1624,3.3,1.4888,2.8214,6.1119,3.3112,1.9031,2.3896,1.4631,0.2133,8.6873,0.8703,0.2518,1.5776,0.4966,4.5802,2.7361,16.3422,2.7064,0.0249,8.7197,1.371,1.501,3.8999,5.3587,0.3156,4.0434,0.0004,0.0005,0.0007,0.5313,0.5565,4.9545,0.8384,2.3812,0.5941,0.9623,0.1587,3.5603,0.5536,2.2588,4.7789,0.7526,1.9236,3.6194,1.6903,4.8375,2.233,0.6976,0.1365,3.5725,0.4934,1.4642,0.0024,3.9532,2.4635,1.7084,0.0002,3.8882,0.7586,1.1352,3.9212,4.1942,0.2719,5.099,1.4076,3.0204,3.7698,4.0414,5.4249,0.5607,4.4218,0.0038,3.1584,1.0091,4.9948,7.2809,0.119,3.4748,4.0413,0.0093,0.0244,0.7626,1.9411,3.9401,1.6899,1.5217,7.6347,3.5303,4.8851,2.7316,2.9022,4.5455,1.5524,3.5896,2.3128,1.4558,4.5034,1.0389,3.4985,0.0761,4.2385,2.646,3.4226,3.0551,0.0031,3.6854,0.2876,0.5818,3.2825,1.8987,0.2056,2.6687,0.0001,0.559,5.6406,0.577,0.9479,0.0364,0.0171,5.2429,4.3569,0.4398,1.7248,3.3666,3.4081,2.191,3.9953,3.3473,0.3247,1.3087,5.361,0.1328,1.8424,2.3252,2.0392,0.0576,0.3406,5.0353,2.5146,3.8395,1.4768,4.2218,5.959,3.5698,1.7029,0.6481,6.4081,1.3263,0.6971,0.0125,3.1906,3.7402,3.2175,2.9068,3.2988,3.0802,0.136,3.3128,5.3222,3.4577,0.078,0.5143,4.2181,1.1221,0.753,3.0887,5.0245,0.0178,1.9918,5.2796,2.2783,3.0999,0.3093,0.9506,0.0734,4.1377,4.5762,0.5118,1.9342,3.4534,3.5546,0.3267,4.3629,5.7648,0.6892,1.2763,1.1697,4.3841,6.7442,0.001,2.3314,5.8297,2.6479,0.1058,0.3425,3.8371,2.1826,1.0609,2.4523,3.2409,2.2847,5.3142,1.7571,2.183,0.2328,2.7132,1.3897,0.3642,3.2672,0.2267,0.8569,0.7878,1.6095,3.2522,0.5144,4.6,0.5136,3.7472,4.8064,3.4738,0.2634,5.6704,1.0139,2.9735,3.6647,0.225,3.2927,4.2766,1.5606,3.8119,3.8678,1.9573,0.0093,0.0225,4.9701,5.6635,0.5944]}

In 1939 M @ - @ 5 designated a segment of the Grand Rapids - Mackinac Bridge, but other designation used that segment during that time was M @ 5 -N @ 9. The bridge over the Chippewa River was built in 1910, so at that time it had already taken the M @ @ 5 designations. The Chippewa name was added to M @ - @ 5 in 1943 when the US Government changed the type of designation with which it used on state roadways for use on Interstate highways. The Michigan Department of Transportation adopted the change in the designation in 1956. One of the first non-state highways to use the M @ - @ 5 designation is the Mile Rd\/1,000 to Mile Rd\/100,000 Highway. It was built in 1936 during the Depression Era. M @ @ 5 was discontinued in 1954.\nSOURCES: MICHIGAN STATE HIGHWAY DATABASE, 2005","token_len":256,"entropy":[2.8364,7.8015,0.1875,7.3124,12.7988,6.9868,8.0932,5.0924,3.9299,2.8383,1.61,1.109,5.8361,10.7965,5.904,6.4612,0.2809,3.1277,3.0194,1.8575,5.3848,6.402,0.0056,4.0198,4.2042,3.0774,10.1122,0.4412,0.5387,4.2422,5.8228,0.0281,0.0001,0.0031,0.1988,3.4091,1.5855,1.4523,0.0049,0.7935,0.0159,0.2273,1.401,3.7049,0.1326,0.376,0.0068,0.0473,0.3383,0.8358,3.8169,5.1024,1.1633,0.4231,2.8154,3.6214,1.158,0.0046,0.1111,1.7546,4.7389,0.8314,2.8192,5.4537,4.1631,0.0315,0.0647,0.0028,0.0702,5.5518,0.829,3.7959,0.0891,2.4222,3.609,3.3702,0.917,2.2119,0.0004,0.0805,0.1519,2.1665,2.8653,5.6598,5.7212,4.3935,4.7276,3.5104,4.1461,2.0316,0.7125,1.5144,0.753,0.1352,3.3564,1.7773,6.4293,2.1505,4.155,0.7993,2.1196,3.6337,3.8311,0.6068,4.8884,0.0106,0.0003,0.0022,0.039,0.8277,2.6115,0.6183,3.8852,2.0261,3.076,5.3555,1.2682,0.0622,1.9042,2.4999,3.0453,5.5121,1.3378,1.4411,0.0173,3.4697,0.2652,4.1307,0.4781,0.5184,1.7478,3.7858,0.0007,0.0024,0.0059,5.3165,0.6558,3.1449,0.5906,3.3109,0.0085,0.1495,0.0088,0.0231,0.3561,3.4117,2.7338,0.5279,4.3971,3.155,2.9559,0.3453,4.9129,0.357,2.1286,6.9914,2.8551,0.6978,3.1541,2.2243,4.6848,2.9292,0.4005,5.3152,4.4024,0.9742,3.9454,0.6395,0.2289,1.5087,5.2024,0.209,0.0103,0.0285,3.1496,0.5182,3.9658,0.594,2.6632,1.1451,1.0612,3.3669,0.6948,6.5266,1.1586,0.0849,2.4841,5.3575,0.0494,3.6764,1.181,0.4023,1.5714,0.4315,0.899,0.0072,0.067,0.0057,0.0171,0.1699,3.1659,0.5449,6.0106,7.1774,3.2983,4.2742,2.8098,1.8564,4.6487,1.3617,0.0852,0.6024,3.9533,1.2809,0.0847,5.1113,2.0761,2.5006,0.7611,1.5118,0.5567,4.077,6.9294,0.2701,3.3015,3.0912,1.5148,4.0345,0.0247,2.8641,0.2193,1.395,4.062,0.4672,4.264,1.4329,1.3374,10.0356,1.7731,0.9718,0.0069,0.4665,3.0077,1.2463,0.0876,0.0029,3.8022,0.2087,0.1605,2.7151,3.1011,0.0136,0.0259,1.6291,5.2353]}
{"id":3669,"ended":true,"length":249,"gen_text":"The novel is not about the fight between good and evil but rather the differences between madness and reason \u2014 and it is the fairy world that is connected to madness ( mad people can find the fairy world in the mirror). The story is also about the struggle to live up to one's ideals. In the fairy world there is no such thing, everyone has the same abilities, and one can achieve whatever one desires. The only difference between the person who achieves her ideals and the person who fails is the will. The woman who is fighting to escape from her unhappy life is not fighting for her own happiness but for the happiness of all mankind. This book will leave you with questions. You will ask, how? Why? For myself it was hard to connect with the characters, the scenes, and the stories but reading it later on with clearer ideas, more words, and a deeper understanding of the world makes it easier.\n\nThis book can give you perspective on some important things and is full of wonderful stories. It can also teach you a lesson about the difference between a fairytale and a fairy tale.\n\nI believe this is the best book about the fairy world I have ever read and I have already read a few other books.\n\nThis is your book.","token_len":256,"entropy":[8.7143,1.9528,3.9155,3.0302,1.6266,6.4735,1.8297,3.1595,0.0357,0.0156,2.2502,2.6298,1.596,7.0349,0.6485,10.481,0.1055,2.4953,5.932,2.4817,4.2965,1.3529,2.3853,10.7349,6.6255,1.1596,1.9254,8.3724,0.2052,3.004,4.7198,13.929,6.3308,3.4518,4.4828,2.4526,2.4485,0.4052,2.3817,1.093,3.6151,1.4465,1.9884,2.5591,1.1737,2.8522,1.1386,1.0352,4.012,2.5361,2.9152,3.3166,0.0095,1.4282,0.0056,2.3311,1.469,3.0954,1.085,2.9456,0.2466,3.0281,0.6441,0.711,2.3222,0.0674,3.8596,5.5073,2.1903,1.7906,0.382,4.2412,1.773,1.3741,3.6162,1.7028,2.9255,3.0825,0.4686,2.2013,0.5295,2.1536,3.0712,0.703,1.0861,1.1011,5.7082,1.1534,3.2985,2.6943,2.8974,0.1507,0.2006,0.4498,0.1073,2.889,0.7021,1.4518,4.1063,1.6236,2.1826,5.8792,1.0919,2.6927,5.5552,1.7545,4.9287,1.2175,1.3443,5.4163,1.7872,1.684,2.623,2.4473,1.5518,1.5807,1.7713,1.6852,0.9669,0.8851,0.6549,0.3712,0.0217,2.8703,3.622,0.3258,3.4562,4.3857,3.6581,3.8602,0.2288,1.8473,3.6266,1.952,3.6636,0.4807,2.7771,2.4182,3.4137,5.2241,1.2761,0.0752,5.3461,4.3732,3.3269,1.1058,4.1255,0.1482,5.608,1.0082,0.5228,1.5858,1.4561,3.3482,5.8384,1.0088,0.9526,0.2497,4.608,3.4406,6.311,1.0099,5.2893,1.8824,4.7548,6.0803,2.6687,2.3665,3.5138,5.3077,0.5891,0.1954,1.1714,2.7514,0.2966,0.6082,0.4655,2.4624,4.78,0.8258,1.7055,1.6754,2.2866,0.048,3.3669,0.821,4.2179,4.2551,0.2398,5.874,0.9276,4.4461,4.1753,1.7514,3.415,3.9082,3.9068,0.0122,4.3774,2.7087,0.7074,1.6538,3.1303,1.114,2.7093,0.1498,1.9472,3.5859,1.2097,1.8474,3.1418,0.0214,3.4092,5.0605,0.0108,0.0011,0.153,1.3609,2.3602,0.1468,0.3432,1.4864,0.0001,2.7651,5.0931,1.5616,1.9758,1.3903,1.138,0.5583,2.0273,1.4386,0.7954,0.5766,1.2462,0.2215,0.7043,0.0415,2.4369,0.9307,2.8647,6.3128,1.5456,2.4235,1.6415,2.0147,0.8889,3.85,1.7592,0.0001,2.9288,1.4468,6.6185,2.2775,1.1998]}

{"id":4179,"ended":true,"length":236,"gen_text":"In 1903, Pittsburgh Pirates'owner Barney Dreyfuss began to look for ground to build a larger capacity replacement for the team's then @ - @ current home, Exposition Park. Dreyfuss' aim was to create a new ballpark similar in size, feel and amenities to the beloved old stadium. In 1907, the site was purchased and the construction of a new ballpark commenced. The ballpark stood as the major building on West Carson Street until the 1950s. This site eventually became home to the Pittsburgh School of Art.\nIt is a wonder what might have become of this lovely site if it had remained undisturbed for another 100 years. The buildings of the old ballpark were salvaged by local artists and their art pieces moved to various galleries and museums in Pittsburgh. In 1968, the groundskeepers of the site were forced to cut down nearly 40 long grasses that were blocking entrances to the ballpark and the neighboring public streets.

While in Germany, Du Bois remarked that he was treated with warmth and understanding since the German people were \"a people of the world\".\n\nWhile in Japan in 1936, Du Bois also spoke to those in the country. In an interview, he said that Japanese people were proud of their country.\n\nHe was also quoted as saying: [Japanese] soldiers are just like us in America and Europe; they have to put their lives on the line for their country and for their people, and have to go through the death of many people who were supposed to be their friends.\n\nThe Japanese Government has since renounced war with Japan. A ceremony was held in which Du Bois signed an agreement with Japan, acknowledging Japan's pledge to the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n\nDuring World War II, Du Bois stayed in Washington and was treated well by the White House, and returned to work at the Smithsonian Institution. Du Bois published some of the most influential studies of the period.

In its 2015 @ - @ 16 rankings, Times Higher Education World University Rankings also rank the university in the 100-120 band of the world's top 50 universities, falling five places from its second place last year.The university is the only American-based in the top 100 list as of today. The university's reputation is further damaged by the fact that its undergraduate programs and its research have received just two 'outstanding' ratings in the four years leading up to 2015.In August, the Higher Education Policy Institute issued a report noting that the American university has been hit hard by the economic crisis and declining aid from the US Department of State since 2007. In particular, aid from the state of Michigan for 2014\u201315 had dropped by 20%.Moreover, the drop in foreign aid since 2008 has contributed to the financial crisis, and the university can now claim to have some $500 million in long-term debt.In 2011, Michigan State closed seven dormitories, resulting in a reduction in its number of undergraduate students by more than 50,000. In 2014 alone, the university cut about 18 percent of its undergraduate programming, with the loss of about 575 undergraduate faculty members.","token_len":257,"entropy":[1.7594,9.3533,7.8048,0.0151,0.6627,0.6527,6.1194,0.3819,8.0182,2.7205,1.4404,0.0049,0.6835,5.9518,2.2272,0.0077,0.0019,0.0038,0.8512,3.5971,3.9225,2.5293,13.0551,12.6894,8.4104,9.7472,3.2364,0.2131,11.171,0.0028,0.0036,6.4308,0.0629,0.033,5.1137,3.4277,0.7944,0.7828,1.8292,0.9783,4.355,2.2026,2.0821,1.9326,2.5973,1.8808,0.8791,0.3892,0.8265,5.0899,0.3064,1.9615,5.5965,4.1822,0.2397,0.9371,1.1667,5.6255,1.4518,2.8198,0.0056,0.1271,5.594,1.8087,1.9925,2.7567,1.755,3.2215,4.4436,0.3985,5.2616,0.1143,0.6145,0.6114,3.8821,5.6382,2.6022,3.3413,0.4736,1.8594,2.5407,1.7798,4.2429,1.7976,3.6093,2.8583,0.3626,0.9345,0.52,0.0748,2.5185,4.6466,3.502,3.6791,2.4064,2.7531,3.7465,3.128,4.5417,2.2227,4.2815,1.9668,0.0339,0.0864,1.4709,1.4444,0.2988,5.3611,0.4069,5.0107,0.2305,0.0098,1.0287,0.5541,3.1766,5.9274,1.1009,0.8074,4.0562,0.2645,1.2903,0.0038,4.2552,0.2038,0.3385,5.4859,0.2011,1.196,4.5584,2.0196,2.5587,2.0447,3.8989,0.9871,0.1516,0.6218,2.6474,1.3858,1.5291,4.2818,5.564,1.3928,0.7106,0.9893,2.7435,0.0217,1.0859,4.4214,2.0138,0.4155,3.2938,3.5096,0.0319,3.9597,1.8811,0.1754,5.2473,0.6757,1.3989,4.3571,5.2155,4.4312,0.4785,3.7043,2.0461,0.8463,4.2017,2.6897,5.6923,0.0068,0.8591,5.3222,0.1557,4.3352,1.0476,3.4177,2.2245,0.6468,3.3966,0.1812,1.1305,5.1421,1.2762,2.8638,2.7387,1.4747,2.4727,5.6228,2.9347,2.431,1.895,0.9357,5.986,1.3113,4.4135,0.1581,0.8258,4.2513,0.0525,0.0097,0.7828,0.8628,2.8198,4.2127,0.1964,2.6108,0.2374,5.8654,4.4788,3.7043,0.0809,0.0001,1.8414,4.2168,0.0162,1.0193,2.2639,0.835,2.3555,3.5267,0.0309,1.6231,0.443,1.9393,2.3854,0.0025,2.9078,2.8347,0.0341,0.7361,2.2767,2.0725,4.6995,0.0303,0.591,0.4671,3.0719,3.6649,4.1913,3.6753,0.1763,0.095,2.0011,6.2913,1.3198,3.3024,1.6969,2.1132,0.0161,2.2013,3.713,5.4246,3.6754,2.6311,1.7074,0.5444]}

She points out the difference between a rumor and a complaint of sexual misconduct, and says she has no proof that she's telling the truth.\n\nBut for her accusers, the question of who is telling the truth is a different matter.","token_len":258,"entropy":[7.1314,0.264,8.6285,6.292,0.7876,5.5828,2.3919,7.2946,2.3363,3.8829,2.088,9.741,0.1678,1.7598,1.2903,10.9564,1.0354,0.3007,5.0949,1.7845,1.8029,9.1731,7.9803,2.358,4.0243,0.2405,0.0219,6.2487,4.4198,0.1842,0.0994,0.7171,0.2609,0.5977,3.5298,4.2961,1.074,5.4206,1.0886,3.8975,1.7667,3.7183,1.3632,5.3975,3.3825,2.0666,2.647,0.5785,0.5484,1.172,4.1283,5.9185,3.9967,2.5806,2.4425,2.9095,4.9459,0.0642,1.5806,0.4943,2.5852,1.8121,2.0851,0.289,0.3733,1.6281,0.0005,0.3113,6.0666,2.8535,2.8842,3.3412,1.0907,0.3824,5.5319,3.0094,1.2706,2.2914,0.2345,1.8966,0.5518,1.3159,1.1057,0.2647,0.0901,1.7765,0.0002,1.9276,3.5003,5.4127,4.9596,1.2719,6.0023,5.4711,5.5818,1.1909,0.9768,1.411,5.6585,2.8665,0.5206,1.93,2.5036,1.7168,1.6209,0.9333,2.1638,6.4277,2.0636,2.8414,3.4836,4.6665,0.2095,1.3545,3.3673,6.2971,2.1877,3.2877,0.8711,1.4279,4.481,3.0689,2.4255,0.9551,5.557,0.4855,1.6183,4.6415,2.8361,3.6801,3.6459,1.7386,1.088,4.0423,5.0766,3.1508,2.8214,0.0018,2.1942,0.2355,0.0002,0.4459,3.8322,0.9969,1.7725,1.3713,1.4012,0.3462,3.4236,3.6371,0.0002,1.1483,3.9773,3.7201,0.0014,2.6879,1.8522,5.8001,1.5351,4.2809,0.6546,0.0723,0.2559,0.106,0.7632,0.6985,0.0557,0.0503,0.2139,6.4499,2.931,4.2585,0.0169,5.2165,6.7351,1.5745,5.3712,2.4102,2.6462,6.6838,4.0156,2.2391,0.0671,0.0002,4.5605,2.1806,0.2448,0.0074,0.4929,0.6355,0.2925,1.1531,3.8966,0.2712,2.3768,0.2918,2.5427,3.0721,2.9923,0.1542,2.7024,3.7112,4.3366,1.3801,2.4833,0.8631,3.3148,0.5886,2.5927,5.3128,1.0424,3.7791,3.1428,0.1527,3.1622,5.6908,0.4565,0.3827,4.6902,4.7766,0.6295,1.7805,2.0469,0.7928,0.8966,0.9893,2.8308,1.3005,4.5054,0.8994,1.9355,2.3958,5.4928,0.0205,0.0217,0.3195,0.338,0.0002,2.8315,3.6862,2.7986,4.804,0.0004,0.1474,1.9571,3.2364,1.8294,2.9599,0.9768,0.1124,0.0137,0.0064,1.0245,2.3259,2.5619,0.7839,0.4232]}

Antiretroviral treatment is usually given to all sexually active people who have HIV, not just to HIV patients.","token_len":258,"entropy":[7.7858,6.7415,0.0043,0.0003,0.0013,0.0054,0.4977,6.6454,0.1508,0.9096,1.6654,2.1636,0.3344,13.0638,3.1272,3.622,3.4667,0.9033,2.6226,1.152,0.7839,1.3309,0.9366,0.5075,2.4606,2.8438,0.2513,0.0008,0.0001,0.0043,0.0138,0.9923,4.7342,10.0982,0.1451,0.262,1.912,0.2047,1.3121,4.5347,0.4538,1.3254,1.6332,2.0619,2.5678,0.3191,2.9907,1.4328,3.9358,0.0028,3.5097,2.5612,1.0518,0.1268,0.6426,0.5464,1.6392,0.0132,2.1032,2.0017,1.3238,2.2849,6.4821,4.0757,3.3737,1.7686,0.5986,0.9467,0.5007,0.0412,0.1251,0.8314,2.3472,0.0002,4.9774,2.2348,3.6995,0.9894,2.0069,0.1218,1.2467,2.2877,0.0075,2.6924,1.0789,1.8233,0.1642,0.236,0.0002,5.5916,0.7269,0.0257,1.1535,0.6575,0.448,6.9921,5.5373,0.1394,0.0318,0.0002,0.0014,0.0075,0.9102,0.9602,0.8215,4.5073,2.2724,3.2615,0.0993,6.6932,4.524,0.7508,0.0002,5.0792,5.2145,1.6711,2.4368,0.8026,0.3403,2.7837,4.6416,0.2579,0.5917,2.9603,0.8295,0.0002,2.4558,4.267,1.8183,0.5735,1.366,2.4467,1.6413,2.9741,0.0005,0.0003,0.0,0.0234,1.949,1.4803,1.1729,0.4733,1.9282,3.0385,1.2783,2.4044,2.051,7.6804,0.3115,1.3198,4.9341,1.9392,2.944,3.2757,1.2965,1.3014,0.083,7.3182,5.9623,3.9813,0.0015,2.1978,0.0008,1.6404,4.2515,2.0231,2.2919,0.1519,1.1884,0.6976,0.0064,6.0896,0.2177,3.7487,3.9394,2.6541,0.0008,2.0335,0.4963,3.472,1.3598,0.6278,0.0002,5.886,0.1164,6.223,5.7509,2.1014,4.5812,0.5089,1.7896,3.6238,0.6171,0.018,2.3252,5.3169,5.7205,0.6796,5.3582,4.1217,4.5334,1.3023,4.89,1.4864,0.5565,0.3586,0.5736,0.0002,4.4671,0.0936,0.0007,0.0011,0.0726,2.0016,2.2986,1.7583,2.1082,2.4588,2.0841,0.2433,0.9289,0.069,2.6671,3.8422,2.4368,0.2807,1.8365,0.0084,2.2103,2.3372,1.4737,2.2391,0.2603,4.998,0.0404,0.0005,0.0003,0.0363,2.366,1.3475,2.4471,1.635,2.5057,2.508,5.3871,0.0157,0.5877,1.5555,0.8295,0.9003,3.6624,4.2975,0.1015,1.2627,2.9307,2.3146,0.1372]}

This would have meant that the debris cover from the bridge had fallen, making the bridge appear longer than it actually was (about 45 seconds).","token_len":259,"entropy":[1.6007,8.3968,5.6336,11.4468,1.3908,2.9545,2.0348,3.4525,1.373,3.2224,0.2744,2.8865,0.1889,2.7948,0.5364,1.7703,7.2993,14.345,7.6386,5.8706,10.9656,3.6325,7.7517,5.7606,10.2605,3.8806,12.7171,3.8879,0.7763,7.6992,2.609,0.4477,3.0035,0.8947,4.2104,1.7147,1.2105,3.4222,0.0125,0.127,3.49,4.4752,5.596,6.026,1.3523,3.0397,0.1424,3.3437,0.9259,5.2646,0.0231,1.7525,3.0192,0.034,0.0978,1.3131,2.9163,0.2589,3.3548,4.825,0.4529,5.5482,1.9768,1.2522,1.1434,2.4393,4.5132,0.888,1.0082,3.1178,1.1747,2.4175,3.4905,0.5768,3.0109,0.0121,0.1321,0.7598,2.8411,0.4677,0.4857,0.6101,0.0076,0.0509,0.0088,1.4284,1.9717,0.5427,5.5027,0.3929,2.5258,7.5288,0.1053,1.9772,3.6548,2.5335,1.6842,4.593,0.339,0.2427,0.6374,0.8911,0.0002,5.1024,4.9364,4.5211,4.7238,6.2366,1.2431,0.1768,5.0465,3.0836,4.3854,4.4435,1.7855,1.2176,0.6779,1.0026,2.6953,0.0293,0.0556,5.489,1.5526,3.2769,0.5224,5.4428,1.73,4.5991,0.3488,2.8853,0.0364,0.302,0.0891,2.1724,0.6774,1.1219,4.5082,1.1415,5.0857,0.7954,4.9992,5.1007,0.7108,5.1615,3.8581,0.6111,1.4638,1.17,0.5703,1.4585,0.0002,2.7729,5.7232,0.2393,3.277,0.6657,0.2602,0.0072,0.3747,0.0849,4.6387,4.5574,4.5059,0.6628,0.1971,2.9794,0.1284,0.5758,4.3074,2.2286,1.0285,0.0587,0.9973,1.5357,2.2112,1.6017,3.1285,0.3902,1.8754,0.0362,0.4161,0.0046,0.0983,0.0706,0.8209,3.9377,0.0355,0.2196,0.9499,0.1146,5.3976,0.6252,0.191,1.0939,2.9756,1.7596,2.7569,3.3604,0.0888,0.0579,1.7144,0.2538,1.0638,0.908,0.203,0.0213,2.5042,0.3323,5.1803,1.5233,1.0589,0.2698,0.9266,2.5206,0.3052,4.0218,3.1155,1.4805,7.0896,2.8597,0.4223,2.0296,0.5336,1.1959,0.0253,2.6493,0.4157,0.0465,4.2693,0.5288,3.9759,3.0021,1.6136,4.5069,0.6837,1.0475,1.0454,5.1392,3.7468,0.2432,2.2145,2.9323,4.2514,3.9811,3.7395,1.0682,1.354,2.1692,5.6585,0.7817,0.1276,0.6545,0.4121,5.4189,2.7291,4.4985,0.4915,0.5419]}

By the same token, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez provides a way of getting inside the head of a revolutionist, as well as a way for the reader to examine the real relationship between revolution and history.","token_len":260,"entropy":[7.9846,4.062,3.5225,0.5624,0.0094,0.0,9.9065,0.8234,0.857,5.2934,0.0648,7.6786,5.7997,4.9609,3.7881,2.2697,0.0392,0.4252,3.5392,4.1167,0.6398,3.0056,1.6971,2.5856,4.037,8.1717,0.8398,0.0,1.779,2.4348,1.7174,8.5443,1.2177,0.0008,0.0162,0.1089,2.4541,3.1656,3.3975,1.7622,2.7204,1.2558,3.4996,3.28,1.6284,0.5064,3.8647,3.0109,3.7099,1.4899,5.7362,3.4413,5.0628,0.0002,3.1358,1.1546,1.7379,4.5597,0.0985,5.9251,3.6201,2.0265,0.6517,2.695,5.6309,0.6753,5.1675,2.1569,3.7249,2.7202,0.5415,4.9376,3.4674,1.7289,3.1264,0.0001,5.7491,5.8655,0.5017,5.5963,2.4469,3.985,0.0487,3.4333,0.8077,0.0003,2.0749,1.1405,5.0945,2.2716,2.8211,0.0813,1.184,3.9253,1.3741,1.6692,5.5179,0.1171,2.6397,1.0749,2.8308,0.6023,4.9584,0.0326,2.8595,3.7906,0.5333,4.796,0.0001,4.3846,0.5765,2.7804,3.3126,3.7401,6.658,5.7658,5.9077,4.7228,5.4217,2.0647,6.4487,0.0929,5.0937,1.6816,0.0399,6.3603,4.8434,1.4241,3.9414,5.6542,1.794,4.0833,2.4213,3.2125,2.1605,1.6636,0.6992,2.6699,3.9176,0.4723,0.0668,1.1456,0.002,0.0081,0.0,0.0003,0.0,5.5128,2.4799,1.5632,5.8591,3.7647,4.4311,0.0832,4.0424,2.6308,1.6371,2.1823,4.4527,2.1966,3.7723,0.3986,3.5977,1.4587,0.1735,1.6974,3.1551,0.6105,1.8343,0.0002,5.3763,1.7647,1.9888,3.2616,2.881,2.7585,4.9149,0.4116,3.0999,0.7767,0.0002,4.7405,0.3022,3.7694,0.8705,1.9853,5.355,4.316,0.5322,1.3066,2.502,3.1648,2.8585,1.0875,1.4042,0.4999,0.889,3.5824,0.6678,2.5843,1.1719,2.6652,4.6143,3.5103,3.4313,0.1446,0.9957,0.001,0.0029,0.0002,0.0004,0.0001,3.8518,4.2952,1.5611,3.386,1.0873,4.755,3.2573,1.0007,0.0149,0.0361,1.8623,0.0009,0.0036,0.0004,0.0006,0.0001,5.7547,0.9664,4.5633,1.2739,5.7319,3.3435,0.4376,2.1733,0.017,1.7263,2.9501,0.153,1.5778,3.0844,2.1684,0.0273,1.1816,0.574,3.0823,1.5598,0.2543,0.0434,5.1301,0.7232,4.9295,5.6985,0.0912,2.8939,0.0871,1.7664,0.2202]}

{"id":4248,"ended":true,"length":229,"gen_text":"Valiente was born Doreen Edith Dominy on 4 January 1922 at Colliers Wood in the Southern English town of Mitcham, Surrey. Her father, Harry Dominy, was a civil engineer, and her mother, Agnes, a housewife. Her surname meant 'thorny' because of her long blond hair and fair complexion, although she has brown eyes. She studied at Cambridge University and played football and piano with her school-going elder brother Peter. She had her first taste of acting when she played a nun in a wartime propaganda film about Nazi Germany's treatment of the Jews. After leaving university she became a model and dancer, winning a stage play with the Ballet Russe in 1959. She also appeared on stage in various plays and musicals, but it was with the German actress Hannelore Bousset that she first took the plunge into more serious drama. Although the German film company had no English-language films at the time, she landed a role opposite Michael Caine in the controversial \"Hiroshima Monologue,\" a documentary about the atomic bombing of Japan, directed by Werner Herzog.

In 1850, Britain passed the Contagious Diseases Acts. During the early 20th century, similar laws were passed in most European countries.

These wrappers were sold by pharmacies as sanitary napkins, and later became popularly known as sanitary belts.\n\nIn England and the United States during World War II some women used the oral contraceptive pill in order to prevent pregnancy during wartime.

Hopefully, people will read this and maybe reconsider and give us what we deserve.

I did feel a slight buzz with that first time I did it, probably similar to a good cup of coffee or a dose of a strong pain reliever. It was still very subtle. However, it became more intense the following day. I have since stopped it. On the second day, I noticed a slight headache and I felt very uncomfortable but I did not have to go to see a headache specialist.I did not need to see a specialist on the third day, although I did need another dose to get the full effect of this amazing plant.This is a great plant to start from, it gives you the experience of a very, very potent LSD experience. And you only need to take a tiny amount. I've done three doses now and I found that the difference in the effect is really small, so I would not recommend trying to experiment with higher doses.

{"id":1479,"ended":true,"length":237,"gen_text":"The earliest research into thinking machines was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain has 'neurological circuits' similar to the systems controlling the movements of a bison in motion; this has been termed the'motor threshold theory.' These circuits are active at the same time as the motor signals from the brain.\nWith this simple theory of motor control, and its application of the theory of neuronal circuits, a computer algorithm could be built that could simulate the motor-threshold theory in the brain. The algorithm could then be used with the bison hypothesis of thinking to simulate consciousness. While doing so, the algorithm could also test out the idea of 'brain-mind' interface, which is the theory that our mental actions are linked more precisely with brain activity than with our sensory input. It has received less attention in its recent history, but the implications for thinking and mind-machine interaction could be far-reaching. Today however, we have taken a major step forward by showing that the brain-machine interface can work. We have not yet made the jump to 'thinking machines,' but as we examine the limits of this research, it does not seem that long from now.","token_len":262,"entropy":[8.2319,7.6191,1.7777,10.2059,5.2061,1.3736,5.5356,0.0809,2.6561,8.7648,0.1928,0.0082,3.6847,2.8956,5.8703,5.8166,0.5191,0.233,1.9233,7.7692,0.2139,1.9218,3.6067,0.0038,0.7831,3.0945,0.0118,0.0019,0.7128,9.0442,1.5356,2.5491,7.9767,0.0057,4.6063,1.0891,0.2435,1.351,1.0326,3.4038,6.149,2.7575,1.4214,2.0784,0.0556,2.5354,0.1838,4.1571,0.1101,2.3556,5.0349,6.2129,1.8324,2.9127,0.0945,1.6854,5.3152,4.7959,3.08,3.7805,3.7754,3.2138,4.6899,2.1576,2.3575,1.1508,13.7845,2.6928,6.2812,2.3314,3.227,2.9606,1.4304,1.57,5.0727,2.7947,1.2912,2.6861,0.1743,0.4397,0.8593,2.2115,5.1956,2.1397,0.3095,1.3999,1.8337,2.2714,10.8414,1.0943,6.654,3.0972,2.9166,1.7866,1.8874,0.7704,4.1351,4.1237,2.704,2.8883,1.6393,2.6334,0.7341,5.2103,2.5498,0.8519,2.7151,5.5091,5.9913,1.6505,0.4167,2.6498,1.2414,1.1478,3.0007,0.7921,3.0622,4.7073,3.7276,0.0004,3.1178,2.2338,1.3874,0.3694,0.4832,1.8481,1.5397,1.3463,0.7068,0.701,0.7657,5.616,1.6598,3.0667,0.0061,3.8911,2.9873,2.2451,1.2068,2.0971,4.6971,0.6336,5.912,5.8997,0.9767,0.2055,0.9957,0.8297,1.0743,1.4695,4.5999,3.8995,0.9479,2.8389,0.9251,2.6783,4.3268,1.1679,4.8146,0.8248,4.0982,1.6647,1.8941,2.0278,1.527,3.7557,0.0903,4.0387,4.2004,5.0227,0.6371,4.0746,6.9206,6.9222,2.1532,3.2895,0.3422,0.3293,0.908,1.9339,3.3954,1.543,0.2289,3.9138,2.5939,6.0548,5.1223,0.4991,1.5836,7.0847,5.1157,1.9144,1.0238,0.6662,2.6301,3.695,2.4291,3.9409,4.1081,4.8283,0.8827,1.3446,1.8193,2.8933,0.1817,3.5829,0.4806,0.0154,0.1506,7.4323,6.4411,0.1306,2.26,2.324,6.1595,1.38,3.3518,0.0849,1.6062,2.3234,3.9526,0.2978,1.9002,2.0602,1.9633,2.9409,0.0451,1.493,3.6487,1.2701,2.898,1.1635,3.8164,0.6542,3.9833,1.6255,3.5373,0.4375,3.058,1.3208,0.5039,2.7272,0.2036,4.673,1.227,5.8937,0.7065,5.2167,0.1895,2.4799,2.6264,0.5251,2.0701,5.9654,1.4343,0.5584,3.0673,1.7991,4.0501,0.1718,1.3685]}

Juno also provides data on the global circulation of Jupiter, and is the longest-lived of the three mission participants (http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/mission_pages\/juno\/main\/home).","token_len":263,"entropy":[4.145,10.2557,1.0206,2.7538,3.067,1.3365,1.1727,3.3773,3.6331,0.0006,1.0147,1.4322,4.6645,0.2956,0.1056,2.3506,1.6137,1.0939,2.7609,4.3817,0.0402,0.7119,0.2141,2.584,3.9145,0.0002,0.9293,0.461,0.5057,2.8867,4.4171,0.3151,0.7599,2.6412,5.7881,1.8231,2.5207,1.674,5.6713,1.0607,2.0533,0.0139,4.0187,0.8685,2.803,1.9153,0.5973,0.6297,1.1363,4.5166,1.1025,1.2851,0.0944,0.3874,3.4432,2.9503,2.0471,0.8224,0.5889,1.2733,1.3113,0.768,0.0056,8.4918,0.7899,0.3895,0.7762,1.1378,1.1115,0.8605,2.3986,1.5584,0.0297,0.9219,1.2921,0.0097,0.0059,1.3104,2.7085,0.7175,5.857,2.975,0.3831,2.2508,4.0166,1.1931,4.8473,1.4514,5.3963,0.3055,1.9615,1.0388,0.3739,0.4734,5.0505,5.9662,1.8093,2.0684,0.5141,1.2865,5.51,2.4544,0.2814,1.2821,2.6938,3.671,0.6607,5.4502,5.369,1.3059,3.9578,3.1469,3.9074,0.4234,1.1109,5.5339,0.0578,0.0032,0.3577,3.2949,1.4119,4.3554,0.0663,2.7007,3.3007,1.3407,0.3257,2.6521,0.009,1.5727,0.0139,4.8071,4.6159,0.7162,1.919,2.112,3.4632,0.0021,4.6049,1.1132,2.3424,0.0832,0.1864,0.0005,0.0012,0.0001,0.0234,1.6346,0.0007,0.0145,1.7864,1.983,1.2801,1.102,3.5032,0.2155,0.4011,3.01,1.2211,0.134,2.0382,2.3772,1.0233,3.1645,1.6611,0.9513,2.5357,4.6674,0.0051,1.5478,2.9941,3.3235,4.2867,1.6288,0.834,2.6446,4.7577,0.4485,1.0783,4.0168,1.0155,2.3955,0.1378,0.7873,0.3655,3.6185,1.3879,0.061,0.0719,0.0662,0.0508,0.0003,6.7665,3.4483,0.9563,0.3803,0.0723,0.7246,0.0043,0.0024,0.0,0.0,0.0011,0.0,0.7794,3.2222,0.5408,2.6872,0.5749,4.4939,1.6446,0.0363,1.7864,2.5031,0.7741,0.3348,2.4743,0.3832,0.9261,1.8121,2.4957,4.5895,2.5467,0.5509,0.4435,5.5947,2.8186,0.5719,0.6261,0.7842,1.6277,2.7416,1.3197,7.2003,0.8402,0.4779,3.8703,0.3565,1.3043,4.8961,5.5869,2.8211,5.3115,0.0002,0.7266,0.0263,0.8181,0.0018,0.0013,0.0002,0.0031,0.4284,0.0107,0.001,0.003,0.755,0.0001,0.015,1.2381,1.505,2.2693,3.9294]}

In this section, M @ - @ 33 has a three-way intersection with M @ - @ 41, but there is no traffic signal between these roads. This section also does not have a stop sign or traffic signal. The three-way intersection is at the south end of the property. The three intersections discussed in this blog are the shortest road segments of the two major highway segments mentioned above. A review of the map would suggest that for any given road segment, a particular road is the shortest route through an area or combination of features. The distance from the shortest road segment to another has no relationship to the number of miles traveled, nor does its location within the road segment. Also, the relationship between the length of any road segment and its size is not defined by the number of intersections, so some of the shortest road segments are in very large areas. Road segments with the shortest total distance to another are not necessarily the most frequent, however, as they can be in dense, traffic-packed areas.","token_len":263,"entropy":[10.6882,6.8345,0.0003,1.5927,0.2143,7.9611,13.8891,6.8423,9.5273,7.7497,14.1629,0.1463,3.6517,1.0271,0.561,0.5738,4.1162,2.5596,3.5019,6.8827,0.4021,4.5661,0.0571,8.2681,8.3291,4.8259,2.4352,2.9766,4.12,1.4805,3.8217,8.5033,1.2585,2.0583,4.5473,10.7449,0.5916,2.2018,2.3233,3.8416,1.3691,2.7135,3.9828,0.0564,0.0754,0.0251,4.86,4.0452,1.6666,2.395,1.5359,1.7769,0.8363,1.3614,0.0285,0.018,0.0101,5.134,0.8708,4.1173,3.2948,2.9539,0.7116,1.8734,0.0201,0.0123,0.0098,5.0158,4.2838,0.9104,5.1279,0.1418,0.5167,0.9338,0.34,0.4403,0.0052,0.0037,0.0035,3.0311,1.4624,3.6309,2.7671,0.4591,0.2839,3.43,0.5103,4.267,2.2877,4.9993,0.2004,2.949,1.327,2.4601,4.287,0.009,0.1634,0.694,3.1399,0.1019,2.1499,1.1586,0.5146,1.1788,2.1796,4.2085,0.1962,0.0151,0.1151,1.5358,2.794,0.7626,3.5098,0.2112,0.0139,0.6763,5.1496,1.5028,1.9142,2.8861,4.2612,6.1505,1.2899,0.235,7.2148,1.2185,2.3941,5.1657,4.6507,0.8126,2.574,0.7794,4.1913,3.7351,3.0495,1.142,4.3013,1.1236,0.2405,4.1827,5.514,0.013,0.6066,3.3969,5.1378,3.0332,0.1936,6.1958,3.3886,2.5041,2.2225,0.0705,0.3699,2.9603,4.4424,2.3558,2.6184,3.2044,0.5932,2.5531,3.9974,3.6325,0.5665,4.2492,5.4439,0.0082,6.5951,1.0184,2.1342,4.5352,1.467,1.1677,1.0403,0.7001,0.1286,0.1175,4.0752,5.6241,2.7912,2.6002,0.1493,0.2381,2.9091,0.0413,2.4564,1.489,2.3712,2.584,0.7495,5.1178,2.5136,2.4952,0.7673,4.3016,0.859,0.7606,5.8213,0.1318,1.1655,4.2511,0.3681,0.7584,1.9452,0.1125,3.278,1.2709,0.0693,0.1014,0.8977,5.4264,0.9829,1.1852,5.068,1.4787,0.7591,1.9193,0.0455,2.6249,1.5913,5.3299,4.6547,2.094,0.2897,0.7121,0.6163,0.0125,1.2678,3.7638,3.215,2.5529,0.5531,0.5407,5.4388,0.6506,1.9019,1.8489,0.7416,5.0195,1.3104,2.3259,2.656,1.2005,2.1581,0.9379,0.2652,2.7707,4.685,2.6661,4.7764,1.3484,1.4257,2.5746,2.9402,0.725,3.1609,6.0177,2.8315,6.2307,0.1197,2.8348,0.2798,0.5061]}

In the following months, public lynchings and vigilante attacks continued to undermine hope for social and racial equality.\n\nAt the turn of the 20 th century, urban black communities across the United States were marked by segregation and racial discrimination. Slavery had ended in most United States, with Blacks confined to areas of the South where they could not vote. Slavery was still widespread in Louisiana and Texas, however. African-Americans found this discrimination hard to endure, and organized movements to push for social and economic equality. These movements were fueled, in part, by a backlash against the Black Codes, harsh, repressive laws that enforced segregation through restrictions on citizenship, voting, and public accommodation.\n\nThis is a synopsis of the historical perspective described in the study, based on the work of DuBois and other scholars.","token_len":263,"entropy":[13.3515,0.6565,3.1975,1.4281,7.7321,0.274,6.7217,6.717,9.7999,0.6649,2.2387,1.8624,4.9999,0.1777,8.3598,3.4521,0.0753,12.364,0.5606,0.0002,1.0837,6.6146,0.9344,1.784,0.0492,6.7443,5.4673,2.2394,7.4017,0.0154,0.0421,0.0006,0.1594,12.9424,9.7395,5.8898,0.7899,4.6697,3.1844,0.0132,1.9942,2.3961,0.578,5.0722,1.5311,5.5883,4.0408,1.8109,0.0043,0.2009,3.1224,0.002,0.0161,0.1108,5.9304,4.2318,1.4001,5.4882,0.9752,4.3439,2.2357,1.2571,0.8897,3.6817,1.0264,5.3967,0.4786,1.3473,3.7649,1.1094,0.1111,0.1413,2.2314,2.1952,0.7096,1.6638,0.0043,1.5973,4.3095,4.8535,1.9667,0.4823,3.5629,7.0727,0.0225,1.555,4.1284,1.1299,0.01,0.4374,0.7318,0.5531,6.0485,5.3788,5.1001,0.2391,0.3775,2.6505,1.8381,2.7005,0.8906,0.1708,5.7939,0.3241,0.5593,0.0004,2.4295,3.3063,1.3508,2.9298,1.1987,5.7787,5.8924,0.3974,3.8364,1.7539,2.9506,1.0039,0.5713,0.4779,0.0002,4.4962,0.4695,3.4119,0.0046,0.0324,2.7976,3.5682,0.1,0.0974,6.1127,3.1714,1.6131,3.521,0.1098,1.3109,0.0012,1.1538,4.627,0.0555,4.1363,0.9827,2.3318,2.2981,0.4712,5.2076,0.0928,2.1088,1.4506,0.7525,2.252,5.8973,0.001,2.9581,4.5111,2.8101,3.628,0.1652,4.4304,1.4329,0.3737,1.6018,1.7337,0.8506,1.5528,0.6921,0.887,2.033,4.4154,0.1422,1.405,2.2037,3.3804,0.2631,4.641,1.4087,2.7878,0.4117,3.427,1.816,3.8261,3.4174,0.3977,4.5518,6.0695,3.5572,3.1698,0.0083,3.6872,1.1287,0.6938,4.2634,5.5369,1.3949,5.1001,0.4275,2.9062,0.6,0.6551,0.7228,0.2925,2.9314,0.943,1.6851,3.0731,3.7605,0.2526,0.3362,0.0128,0.0134,2.8956,5.4819,0.4437,0.7347,4.314,1.6191,1.0467,6.3699,4.1711,3.5818,0.571,1.717,2.5754,0.9029,5.0776,5.026,0.0493,4.8063,1.1004,1.4944,0.7439,0.4999,2.3368,1.8482,0.1512,0.8109,0.0002,4.5723,4.6966,1.5876,4.9917,0.0907,0.8676,4.9843,5.9106,6.4955,0.4296,1.6585,6.08,1.8697,5.3962,0.1019,1.3521,2.8374,0.061,2.4602,3.8698,0.0197,1.242,1.9222,1.6595,0.4818]}

However, the origins of the Oldham Carnival and its traditions are not as clear-cut as those of other British Carnival traditions such as the Royal Society Carnival. Also, while in Britain the English and Americans have tended to see the Carnival as one of the main English festivals, American and English Carnival traditions are very different.","token_len":263,"entropy":[8.567,8.421,3.7825,7.0019,6.2667,6.2854,4.6304,1.6035,5.0409,1.4998,3.4019,1.7296,3.7809,2.1579,1.6163,0.832,2.1833,2.2662,0.1112,1.5123,0.1348,2.5666,8.7907,0.8153,13.6543,15.5515,1.9122,0.0002,0.2622,0.1962,6.6058,0.0005,0.1853,2.461,0.1123,3.4223,3.8234,1.7941,6.4258,2.0088,3.5267,2.4561,0.6502,4.6366,1.8322,3.9169,2.2167,6.0511,1.041,3.8153,0.037,2.9698,0.1718,4.9266,0.0947,3.6473,3.9593,3.3705,3.0368,0.1972,1.0814,2.2456,0.0038,0.3925,5.5573,6.2871,0.7591,0.661,2.4483,0.1825,1.363,1.9824,2.6364,2.8437,5.5902,6.0681,0.9668,4.2543,5.4578,0.8527,3.8758,1.2344,4.1728,3.4166,5.6514,0.0028,1.9091,2.0836,3.5525,4.9275,0.0318,0.3036,1.3441,0.2311,0.2774,4.679,1.0548,5.0841,0.746,2.2995,5.5443,0.1911,1.9021,2.9006,0.9837,2.6852,1.3359,3.0268,4.0201,1.4279,0.6216,0.518,0.2904,4.3715,2.5423,3.7348,4.1124,6.3825,2.5524,0.0076,5.3,0.0167,2.1703,2.0037,5.1938,0.0226,3.0545,2.8877,2.505,0.5516,0.4865,2.6871,0.0014,0.612,4.205,3.4225,0.8585,3.3925,1.6286,0.1228,0.734,0.0002,3.2667,0.0286,0.4189,6.1495,5.3369,5.4343,4.2853,2.1156,1.3423,4.2102,4.4294,0.7514,5.7321,5.1594,0.9677,5.921,3.2654,2.899,3.2476,1.0385,3.0255,3.9219,1.36,2.9024,0.1025,4.233,5.0404,0.1424,5.267,1.4526,1.7629,1.3942,3.9723,3.0046,0.0319,5.0261,5.4613,2.4818,2.1291,4.0974,1.0143,0.0057,0.1804,3.2477,0.9895,4.8749,0.0071,0.5181,2.9702,0.154,0.6914,3.9807,2.0966,2.0409,4.0,1.1449,4.2584,0.055,1.5674,2.9971,0.138,0.381,1.0134,0.0025,0.0608,3.8802,1.3864,2.9239,0.9992,2.2982,2.5902,1.2665,1.6962,0.0094,0.4481,2.3291,0.4174,2.7087,2.9272,1.8124,0.6854,3.334,0.0035,0.6982,4.5658,5.3547,1.4389,1.7321,6.3458,0.1453,3.7332,4.6882,3.9388,1.0643,6.0918,3.4026,5.5903,1.568,4.8933,0.0222,3.7122,0.5555,1.1547,0.2792,3.9041,1.1358,0.6057,3.7933,4.2261,1.897,0.3845,5.4341,2.676,1.6431,2.7308,0.4911,1.3743,2.5728,0.2559,0.5303]}

S\u00e9rurier was buried in the small cemetery outside the town of Gioia, not far from the town where his daughter was born.","token_len":263,"entropy":[3.0028,7.395,3.8199,8.9045,8.2489,12.4495,0.0809,9.9215,7.0314,0.6939,9.1282,6.3177,0.9438,4.9487,6.3635,0.8565,2.0955,5.228,5.8021,0.0284,3.0626,0.0071,6.9465,14.1701,2.2463,1.7704,1.0264,4.1924,0.7092,1.6733,0.0019,0.7251,0.1141,0.3415,9.288,0.0039,0.0113,3.6826,0.1603,3.248,4.4286,5.0108,3.2461,3.2476,5.0918,0.2885,0.6155,3.617,2.6107,5.607,1.229,1.5979,0.0084,0.0023,0.0004,2.4548,3.2445,0.4954,4.2771,2.8774,0.5305,1.1543,2.6983,0.285,5.3217,0.0167,0.3993,0.4717,0.14,7.455,2.5273,0.0087,0.0012,0.0011,1.7643,3.2066,2.9769,0.3245,3.0751,0.8685,1.3413,0.0156,5.0558,5.5057,0.0008,5.2493,5.4381,0.7222,1.5394,1.19,0.0036,0.0016,0.0004,0.6791,5.4819,1.4772,5.3341,1.1047,3.6741,5.5694,2.2769,0.0993,7.7005,0.795,1.9359,4.0588,0.5444,3.9282,5.2155,0.0612,1.2223,1.5299,4.2411,1.4902,2.3822,1.9781,3.732,1.2434,0.4234,0.0017,4.4506,0.0328,0.3293,3.4412,3.6787,4.0753,1.8557,0.78,3.7809,1.3905,2.3379,1.0824,4.5366,0.7227,0.4653,0.4774,0.6093,1.987,0.0005,0.0045,1.1471,5.1083,1.813,2.4318,0.0059,0.0024,0.0005,4.2214,4.9206,4.0009,3.0403,3.7345,2.6855,5.6203,3.104,4.0559,0.0154,1.1666,2.5961,0.0187,0.4581,0.9543,4.5285,0.7235,0.3973,6.1165,0.7692,1.0638,3.855,0.5884,0.7223,0.0002,2.9878,2.1346,4.8086,2.5362,0.6325,5.1362,7.0262,2.5452,3.7954,5.6612,0.1463,5.526,2.8209,0.0497,2.3715,0.0504,0.0373,1.2192,0.7418,0.0024,0.0013,0.0003,5.9784,3.3474,4.6719,1.6167,1.0859,3.3486,2.1495,2.4717,3.6603,4.2778,1.1769,1.0922,2.3048,2.5676,2.5315,3.2148,2.4002,4.7864,3.1423,1.0764,5.4987,1.5644,3.3997,5.4683,3.8079,3.7098,0.9672,4.5593,2.5609,4.2765,2.0152,5.3082,5.5654,2.4772,1.0166,5.7887,1.35,2.3212,1.8568,3.4181,0.0105,0.0036,0.0005,1.906,1.6153,0.582,1.2042,4.8408,1.9595,3.2396,1.241,1.2174,0.5904,2.9109,0.039,0.0032,3.4475,3.7682,0.1265,0.0207,0.9525,2.8434,2.9673,1.9758,4.3277,2.1877,0.2753,0.392]}

Du Bois was in the newspaper business until the mid-'30s and worked for Walter Reed Hospital and the Washington Post. After the publication of the article, he founded the Advancement of Colored People, which became an influential newsletter.\nWith the help of African American newspapers, and others, the NAACP launched a national campaign, and organized what he called Black Power politics. This culminated in August 1963 with the passage of the Civil Rights Act. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended poll tax and the segregationist voting practices that accompanied it. It also ended segregation in public schools, hotels, restaurants, movies, public transportation, and more. The 1964 Civil Rights Act also made it legal for blacks and other minorities to vote when the Constitution did not explicitly provide for such a right. Also included in the Civil Rights Act was the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which outlawed discrimination against blacks in employment, public facilities and the use of public funds. This act, along with the Fair Housing Act and the Voting Rights Act, effectively ended Jim Crow laws in the country.\nOther organizations that endorsed Du Bois include:","token_len":263,"entropy":[10.4507,3.2742,0.0001,4.7265,4.1398,0.2265,0.58,5.7412,2.9139,0.998,4.7671,0.1571,0.6293,5.8126,1.5657,4.7506,0.4818,2.1867,0.1263,5.7439,0.6768,3.4539,0.0088,8.3395,6.8763,5.5979,6.7654,10.1814,0.0149,3.2066,4.2156,9.0941,1.5755,0.0322,0.9437,4.2339,6.0657,0.0761,0.3833,2.4409,0.003,0.0002,1.8358,4.9553,1.365,6.2084,0.1222,4.3182,2.4506,2.687,3.6999,1.6929,0.0156,2.9515,3.9141,1.2001,6.4243,6.9673,1.3421,1.7055,0.9744,3.3535,0.5135,0.6734,3.1325,1.7142,3.9888,0.0283,2.0575,5.9353,1.5669,1.2253,4.9159,0.3237,5.1993,0.1278,0.4446,0.5468,0.0166,0.0188,1.2865,1.6143,2.4147,3.4046,1.4491,5.0764,1.2157,1.0254,12.1532,0.733,3.5004,0.0055,5.2958,1.1506,4.3417,0.7523,4.4658,4.837,0.3361,2.5511,0.8851,3.8805,1.1867,2.0314,0.7227,3.9175,2.7959,5.1818,5.8814,6.4176,0.3228,5.7043,2.0165,5.2268,0.5023,3.843,4.4072,0.1947,5.826,1.2075,1.0734,0.1346,3.4404,0.0248,0.0475,0.2734,0.0021,0.0262,1.2413,2.9449,3.2905,0.0032,0.2423,2.3059,0.0553,4.0735,5.9895,2.9119,1.8039,4.3106,3.8391,1.567,3.4988,1.4148,1.412,5.645,0.114,0.3027,2.6063,0.8151,2.8974,2.697,0.3728,1.1007,1.7507,1.2626,5.1381,0.4112,0.5682,0.5004,5.2288,0.5175,2.9046,0.41,0.4973,1.1613,3.9368,0.0502,2.1551,3.4804,0.7705,0.0038,0.0291,1.4522,3.2796,1.0069,3.9517,0.5478,1.6447,2.1055,2.7289,0.2397,0.0466,2.0586,4.5453,3.2129,3.2637,2.2834,0.0026,2.9155,2.5315,0.2576,2.4414,0.6432,0.0737,0.1229,6.2817,2.9422,0.329,0.1363,1.9321,0.0018,0.0118,0.679,0.6611,4.1204,0.0492,1.06,0.0498,0.5899,0.3813,0.0867,2.6798,0.5075,2.5239,1.7563,0.513,1.4375,0.412,1.5782,5.7126,1.3524,3.4756,2.8787,0.0057,0.2835,1.4192,0.3707,3.4288,2.3398,2.9657,2.5825,0.0028,0.463,4.13,0.0296,0.0414,2.1852,0.221,0.7567,0.0037,0.0097,0.6545,4.6871,0.2446,2.29,0.001,1.1164,1.2548,0.4192,4.3524,0.2238,0.6046,6.2054,4.3861,1.8344,5.8112,1.8091,0.0041,0.0001,2.9155,2.2548]}

{"id":3193,"ended":true,"length":240,"gen_text":"The term'heavy metal ', as it was used by Lester Bangs and Dave Marsh at Creem, referred to a sound best exemplified by albums such as Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin III and Judas Priest s Judas Priest.\nIt was the sound of heavy metal songs being'slayed' with powerful chords, loud and chaotic guitars, and a wide variety of blast beats played by the band using an array of instruments, most notably four bass guitars and a drum kit and a rhythm section.\n'Heavy metal' was often applied to bands who wanted to sound metal-like but actually employed instruments that weren't that heavy. The term was so synonymous with bands who were heavily influenced by metal that bands would often reference heavy metal songs by name.\nBy the 1970's, this terminology fell out of general use.\nWith the increasing popularity of jazz, jazz fusion, and funk, the bands of this era seemed more focused on developing their songs in the studio, rather than performing live'heavy metal'shows, and there was a backlash against the genre.\nThe term heavy metal has also faded from public use in favor of the label metal. This change in perception of the band's sound reflects the fact that the band began to change over time towards a darker, more progressive sound.","token_len":264,"entropy":[7.2132,8.7608,11.3145,1.6761,11.3326,2.6372,2.6455,1.9023,1.4464,1.1103,7.0721,0.0705,0.001,2.7038,4.3544,2.8767,4.1514,9.3179,0.6094,1.9239,5.4685,0.1617,1.793,4.5578,7.6476,5.0756,0.0034,0.0433,6.0593,1.6522,0.0043,3.4902,0.0009,0.0058,0.8838,2.1091,0.0169,0.0079,1.9735,1.176,4.6756,0.0013,0.0012,7.8599,0.5112,0.0011,0.0364,1.9859,2.1939,7.0933,0.8579,3.1197,3.6784,0.4708,1.9433,0.1493,5.7501,2.4359,10.6092,6.8791,0.4272,6.7199,3.5899,6.0163,4.9174,1.2909,4.3622,2.6026,5.5907,3.1482,0.6417,1.0446,2.46,5.2933,1.493,0.0087,6.2075,0.2391,5.5766,1.3238,1.4484,2.313,7.084,3.0972,2.323,0.0035,2.4465,1.7839,3.5119,0.8155,5.8438,2.7121,0.7699,1.6112,1.0233,1.5985,0.2731,4.9293,1.7479,4.0837,0.1912,2.5853,1.4818,2.8995,0.6523,0.3001,0.2679,1.039,3.6995,5.0537,0.312,2.5743,2.5787,6.0623,0.1785,1.9602,5.1748,4.7339,1.4311,1.6604,5.9482,5.6174,5.0539,1.8245,3.7374,0.0279,4.821,0.7138,1.2289,2.4798,1.7002,1.0549,4.6549,5.344,0.155,4.7192,2.3972,2.6107,3.8037,0.3389,0.0207,2.6116,0.5032,3.4224,4.1545,0.9165,5.3097,1.8649,0.0411,2.6501,3.5256,1.8137,1.7859,0.6451,4.2413,0.4771,2.6859,1.8799,0.8206,4.1761,4.1937,6.3272,0.2107,0.003,4.7615,0.5172,1.9794,2.3101,5.6316,0.3987,4.1312,0.5891,0.0467,3.0897,1.1815,4.6401,1.2201,0.5303,0.5161,2.9611,0.883,1.573,5.6245,1.963,2.7786,1.2285,5.2289,2.7052,3.8269,0.0673,5.0863,0.9632,4.3602,2.9801,2.1466,1.1112,1.6194,1.2947,0.0076,3.1523,0.4691,7.1468,9.5635,0.0568,6.0458,11.521,3.5976,3.1841,1.5171,4.9607,0.5799,1.2176,4.3782,0.7686,0.8934,2.4808,0.7551,0.3449,2.0578,1.73,3.1289,0.0137,3.5118,2.8693,6.6949,1.2176,4.0332,1.4235,2.7048,3.1728,0.007,0.9117,5.6179,2.5583,2.1,3.5808,4.0553,1.4203,4.4533,2.4505,0.4974,3.1473,1.7943,0.9683,4.7862,0.5116,3.0403,0.0159,1.412,2.4205,5.4454,0.3777,3.367,3.0445,0.7411,7.6085,0.8793,5.1283,1.2441,0.5929,4.2607,0.6071,0.6874]}

Principally a carrion eater, there are isolated reports of it killing and eating injured animals, newborn calves and even birds. The king hawk is known to kill and bury sheep and other species, including sheep in other countries. In the Middle East, carrion birds are occasionally hunted in the hopes of producing a big enough kill to feed the king vulture. Another bird that eats carrion and live animals is the vulture. The vulture eats carrion carcasses, human limbs and birds, but is also known to eat lizards, frogs, turtles and even snakes. The kingfisher (Aquila chrysaetos) is also a vulture, with a reputation for picking off carrion or fish from the sea. As a large vulture can easily be mistaken for a hawk, the kingfisher is also a large predator and hunter in the water, often seen preying on fish and other smaller, less-fishy prey. Kingfishers live on the high seas during the growing seasons. Unlike other vultures, they do not typically roost on the ground.

The order of precedence for the honours granted by Her Majesty is usually based on the date of the Sovereign's accession to the Throne or appointment to the Palace of the Fleet, with the exception of the Order of the Bath, which is for life. Members of the Order of the Garter are appointed by the Sovereign upon the death of Her Majesty's husband, former Prince of Wales Prince Charles, and the Order of the Thistle is an honorary award instituted by Her Majesty's parents, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.\n\nIn 2011 there were 41 honours and decorations conferred, including 14 medals ; 14 grants of knighthoods ; 13 Orders of the Companions of Honour ; and 8 other medals.

{"id":1504,"ended":true,"length":229,"gen_text":"Vins Doux Naturels are `` naturally sweet `` wines that have been fortified with brandy to stop fermentation, leaving residual sugar to add sweetness to the wine. The majority of Languedoc sweet white wines are made with Balsamic vinegar to provide the natural sweetness while still retaining the balsamic flavor and subtle nuances from the wine. If you enjoy the subtle flavor that balsamic adds to a wine, but you are concerned about the taste of Balsamic or its use after fermentation and bottling - see our article on Balsamic and Cidre Riesling: If it tastes okay, don't worry about it. As we said earlier with the use of balsamic vinegar the potential risks are fairly low. As for the wine, Languedoc grapes are one of the worlds leading varietal grapes, so we wouldn't be surprised to see Languedoc whites with very high prices in specialty markets. But if you are after a great vintage white wine from Languedoc, you can be happy with the wines we produce. Balsamic has been used in Languedoc since the 1950's, and it's good to know that Languedoc wine is still on the cutting edge - as it's one of the last regions of France where it is still used to this day.","token_len":265,"entropy":[8.5613,14.9295,3.5075,10.8316,8.3889,6.0469,13.3341,12.0163,5.7573,3.7924,6.6284,2.0692,1.8592,0.7683,4.0543,0.3364,8.661,0.0045,2.7851,7.2646,2.4008,2.7375,4.3921,6.3606,1.1952,2.6128,3.659,1.4121,1.1891,0.3893,0.6536,0.2051,2.0193,5.5701,0.0424,9.841,0.0445,0.0573,10.9799,3.4556,0.1776,0.4534,1.4681,1.341,5.1172,4.8489,0.9544,1.2969,4.5391,3.5032,2.1109,4.0672,1.0792,4.6561,2.411,1.649,0.5545,5.3193,0.0008,0.0032,1.6642,2.1844,5.744,5.3537,3.9748,0.1241,2.129,0.5651,5.0786,0.4644,3.7876,1.7455,3.6813,2.4655,3.9025,1.7931,0.0006,0.0121,2.4492,0.3706,1.0923,1.2405,0.258,3.0442,2.044,2.2662,3.1759,0.3942,0.651,4.8093,0.3215,4.3611,0.0096,0.003,5.3615,3.5062,3.5237,7.7813,1.1294,4.6924,3.5389,0.0003,5.883,4.7095,1.6715,2.4035,0.4047,1.1035,0.0061,0.0122,3.3363,5.3574,4.9374,0.006,4.7021,1.0495,0.0295,4.3739,5.7411,3.9229,2.173,5.1271,0.6673,1.6261,0.0058,0.9059,0.6909,0.0918,0.5476,4.8072,3.1458,2.6852,1.7567,5.8081,2.369,4.1837,0.0057,3.5017,0.0031,0.0062,0.321,5.432,5.7978,3.3403,1.0737,5.1553,0.968,0.8276,4.2079,2.8723,0.697,3.4477,1.4497,3.7422,0.0041,0.007,4.8509,0.5958,4.5876,0.008,0.116,6.3113,3.4239,4.5796,1.3114,1.7143,1.7467,2.4494,3.5888,4.2307,0.0021,1.2568,0.1704,1.1305,0.4869,1.606,0.0018,0.0101,5.3656,2.5089,4.5819,1.419,4.5193,2.3861,5.1736,1.2492,0.571,3.7489,1.6217,0.2023,1.2819,4.5506,0.4476,3.0058,6.3204,2.4943,1.3184,3.0754,0.601,0.0013,0.0012,0.6219,2.1335,1.3495,2.6255,4.7863,0.6315,1.7288,2.0772,1.4127,3.4364,0.9892,5.1358,0.7367,0.006,5.2559,1.6359,0.6968,0.9904,1.2484,0.0011,0.0017,1.8607,0.4432,4.8892,0.4277,1.3413,1.0551,2.3544,2.2829,5.8384,0.3861,0.9234,0.2427,2.2084,0.0026,0.0056,2.7563,1.448,1.5932,5.1935,0.1655,2.3766,0.0111,5.2525,3.6773,1.9088,3.5672,2.9371,0.0263,0.2194,4.1756,3.7572,2.292,0.754,2.4157,1.6832,1.0973,0.4745,1.5514,2.0406,1.9533,0.0655,0.1983]}

However, the leading members of both Houses of Parliament urged that he would be buried in Westminster Abbey. The request was ultimately rejected.\n\nThe burial site in Westminster Abbey is the second chosen by Henry VII for the martyr, after that in Rome. All medieval kings chose their own burial places, and it is interesting to note that Henry VII chose his own grave. He may have felt that the burial on the site he had chosen in Rome was far away from his family and his beloved wife Anne Boleyn. The grave in Westminster Abbey is therefore more than likely the final resting place for Cromwell.\n\nHe was executed in 1547 at Wapping, London, and buried in Westminster Abbey later that same year.\n\nReferences\n\nHistorical Sources in the Press\n\nMarengo, F.P.

{"id":3627,"ended":true,"length":240,"gen_text":"As early as the second half of the 18th century there was little or no new constructions taking place in Tvr\u0111a, and even maintenance of the fort became a burden. In 1809 Osijek Olszewski was in charge of the management of the fort. The fortress was abandoned because of financial difficulties in the second half of the 19th century.\nAn interesting article about the history of Tvr\u0111a is available in the annual report of the Republic of Croatia. During the Second World War the fort was used as an artillery battery and also used during special training. However, it could not resist the intense bombing operations, and all buildings were completely destroyed. Following the withdrawal of the Germans the fort could have been used again but for economic reasons only.\nThe fort was reconstructed twice, first in 1912 and again in 1920. This reconstruction was a large undertaking and it resulted in the renovation and expansion of the fortress with the addition of several large houses and new buildings.\nThe reconstruction and new development were conducted with the help of volunteers from the communities living inside the fort.\nThe project cost some 20 million kuna.\nIn 1927 the fort was given a new name: Kv\u0159\u00ed Rota, which meant the castle of the castle. This name is still used to this day.","token_len":268,"entropy":[7.1425,0.0362,1.6551,3.9994,1.5669,0.283,0.6059,2.8145,0.0985,0.0648,4.5296,1.4375,5.4488,3.4949,0.0254,8.1745,7.4937,0.0384,5.6313,0.3137,0.9095,7.1454,10.9294,0.9325,0.7584,1.4309,1.7102,2.1132,3.7156,10.5347,1.3773,1.0735,5.9007,7.2088,1.3043,3.5148,1.565,1.8871,1.058,3.7406,10.387,5.9932,0.0679,6.3793,1.9655,0.0485,0.4914,2.9056,5.223,0.7911,0.1169,0.7752,5.3175,0.2403,0.3786,0.8698,1.6543,2.7338,3.6059,0.7107,3.4794,5.415,0.434,3.8142,1.2991,1.6313,1.2715,3.0788,0.1064,0.0033,0.0634,0.2728,0.0026,0.0076,0.4787,1.3403,8.9844,3.2969,3.465,1.4786,0.5612,1.7428,0.0746,0.7482,0.0294,0.0003,0.0003,0.013,1.9137,1.2476,1.0576,0.5697,5.8018,1.3686,0.1957,0.1493,4.629,0.0752,1.3015,1.8849,6.3201,0.285,3.0406,0.023,0.0036,1.3399,1.7874,0.2334,1.1309,0.6164,2.2451,2.1812,1.9766,1.8342,3.5735,3.1033,4.3954,5.6597,3.216,1.7061,4.8622,0.3019,2.2122,4.7941,0.4734,3.6395,0.4596,4.7119,2.8748,4.5708,3.3752,0.6322,4.1331,3.1064,0.4817,2.4133,0.2429,0.4185,5.9625,0.2542,5.5338,0.2002,0.34,0.859,2.18,1.174,4.9288,3.999,0.2097,0.9823,1.4327,2.9245,3.5295,4.1083,0.0788,4.1993,1.2305,0.9859,1.6735,2.5942,0.9115,3.5616,5.819,1.6812,2.0426,0.5218,4.827,0.7244,1.2042,0.0472,3.6836,0.3517,3.8421,1.477,0.7887,3.3436,4.5972,2.8084,1.5259,2.594,4.5329,0.0249,1.106,5.1248,2.5725,3.2029,0.011,0.3323,2.0352,4.6326,0.8685,2.584,0.0069,2.668,3.6545,3.5637,1.6027,4.1563,1.6714,0.3504,1.5267,1.3216,3.2774,4.0301,4.3938,2.9783,3.1554,5.5008,2.368,0.6092,1.4561,0.0181,4.8487,1.7889,0.8733,4.9237,3.9836,4.5475,0.301,1.1898,0.4242,1.9931,1.2846,5.4273,2.8275,3.2253,4.007,0.3524,1.554,0.1437,1.3993,1.4981,2.1784,5.0119,0.6114,2.0298,0.2175,4.2946,2.2104,0.7296,0.6571,1.9201,3.9192,3.0611,4.1504,2.1739,1.1759,5.9052,4.8802,2.5313,1.408,4.2447,2.6656,3.8862,0.7034,0.741,4.4697,0.5908,2.9435,0.5226,2.2589,1.1378,0.5722,2.7141,0.2803,0.0326,0.43]}

The Uyghurs, many of who were migrants from western China, had complained on Chinese social media that Han people were taking advantage of them.The unrest in Shache is the latest in a series of violent uprisings in the region, mostly in Xinjiang, which dates back hundreds of years, but has recently intensified amid a severe shortage of resources, worsening living conditions and, most of all, a crackdown on the religious practices of Muslim Uyghurs.At least 44 people have been killed, hundreds injured and about 8,000 detained in Xinjiang this summer in clashes between the police and Uyghurs in which many have been reportedly beaten to death.","token_len":268,"entropy":[10.3252,1.9357,2.4654,2.4441,0.3835,5.2695,0.9006,3.2515,0.7527,2.5409,10.4989,11.9263,1.2206,6.4118,1.2948,0.0162,0.6088,1.2207,2.5691,8.4226,1.0868,3.2273,4.4699,1.5093,0.8098,3.3021,3.5714,3.0222,4.0835,0.4696,2.7947,0.3335,0.7822,6.9085,0.631,0.0087,0.0005,1.4092,8.64,18.5938,9.1684,3.4894,2.2761,4.7232,1.1238,4.0545,1.9026,1.5464,1.3469,2.8484,5.2483,1.1461,2.0156,0.4699,4.4272,0.9054,0.3764,0.0197,0.0025,1.295,2.2247,2.0315,3.2401,0.7162,4.867,3.8657,1.1157,4.7709,0.1537,7.4279,0.0441,4.4686,1.4067,1.7785,1.8551,1.8343,4.1589,1.0932,1.6574,0.011,0.0019,0.5276,0.4354,5.3523,0.5134,0.7098,2.1205,0.1349,2.4129,1.2618,4.0581,0.4851,1.1079,1.6587,6.3842,4.6953,1.1489,2.9607,3.7282,1.165,3.6258,1.6532,5.2491,1.6026,3.7481,0.0847,4.3345,1.2546,4.6802,3.3568,2.4759,3.8427,1.5354,1.6089,3.2805,4.0453,1.3764,0.0082,0.0013,0.4676,1.0679,1.6506,1.1549,4.1607,0.1156,0.0034,1.9536,0.0029,1.3467,0.5313,1.1877,3.0754,2.8938,0.0088,0.0031,0.2198,2.8279,3.8883,0.0553,4.3291,3.0725,5.003,0.603,4.2053,0.6057,0.3413,2.3154,3.452,5.9483,2.7221,0.2811,0.0805,0.6931,1.4807,2.048,0.8891,2.3514,0.8782,0.005,0.5661,0.4559,1.6699,3.4923,2.1985,5.022,1.0552,2.9772,1.1097,0.3641,0.7348,0.1032,0.6139,0.0351,2.2212,4.7561,0.0029,0.0,0.8986,1.6282,1.386,1.4951,5.5859,1.6093,0.6379,0.0035,0.8641,1.8319,6.5755,0.0541,3.4006,0.0142,0.001,2.3777,1.8663,1.0597,2.7362,4.0326,3.6757,1.6017,3.8092,2.0187,0.016,2.3342,1.6594,5.5426,2.933,0.2947,0.2542,5.6491,2.0305,3.1537,0.0019,0.005,2.0146,2.5628,0.4543,2.2095,2.8874,2.6574,0.0917,4.1263,0.0611,0.0816,0.0003,0.1343,0.424,5.1185,0.2606,4.8736,0.0915,0.8726,0.6451,0.0527,3.473,3.3363,0.8062,0.3299,4.1484,4.8874,0.2255,0.2415,2.0412,1.1153,1.3211,0.0005,1.9273,5.2086,2.025,2.3951,0.5064,2.6532,1.7044,0.049,0.5769,0.0086,0.0007,0.179,3.7695,1.4479,2.94,2.7344,0.3968,5.2787,1.3611,1.6264,0.003,0.3141]}

This had been his dream and had been the only way he had been able to maintain what he had built. Due to the fact that he has no significant political experience, Trujillo was unable to gain the support necessary to win the election. After being defeated, he left office for fear of assassination attempts but was assassinated shortly after the ceremony of his departure for his home country. His remains were found in 1986 and were exhumed and returned to the Dominican Republic where he was subsequently reinterred alongside his coffin in a cemetery near the village where he was buried. It is known that he was not the only dictator to live on, as some of the other presidents of the PRRD were later found in hiding.\n\nAppearances Edit\n\nBibliography Edit\n\nSources Edit\n\nP.

Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated movies and was interested in using Simpsons characters to help him do so. The writers worked for five weeks on a half-hour cartoon that Brooks never saw.\n\nGroening pitched several Simpsons concepts to Fox before he settled on one with Bart. After that, it was mostly a matter of finding and hiring the right team.\n\n\"I always had this image where he looked at the show and said, 'This is awesome,'\" Groening said. The show's first pilot, The Simpsons Movie, was created and produced with former Simpsons staff members. Fox also produced the second pilot, The Tracey Ullman Show, which ran on Fox.\n\nWith more shows being licensed to the network and other networks, some familiar faces have departed. But Groening said he's hoping to keep the core group of people who helped mold the early iterations of the Simpsons and the show's DNA intact, so some of the key elements stay with the new show.\n\n\"It'll be really good to feel that familiarity and have a lot of familiar elements,\" Groening said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http:\/\/usat.ly\/1FfIa1G","token_len":276,"entropy":[7.6311,0.1076,8.0768,3.8191,11.7824,2.7267,1.5443,1.8671,0.0377,0.0873,4.8982,0.3515,1.142,7.7241,3.923,1.8611,10.5225,0.0366,8.4034,0.0178,0.0325,0.0037,1.4162,0.8902,1.6243,2.4671,0.0008,2.0713,1.8902,6.1222,0.7163,0.3502,1.5373,0.611,3.5378,0.8227,1.4981,3.3583,3.3969,2.0887,5.2918,0.0141,3.2131,3.8435,0.2849,2.1194,1.8374,2.7144,2.7162,0.5441,0.1543,2.8584,3.9422,5.3005,2.6636,4.7269,1.7788,0.9938,1.2802,5.5893,0.0942,0.0575,3.9516,2.6564,3.1753,5.1973,1.775,0.6737,1.7286,0.0012,1.915,0.0004,4.3706,5.4625,3.4482,3.073,0.5226,2.3639,2.7503,2.4672,1.1118,0.0193,2.4024,3.5083,4.3725,1.964,4.1357,2.3799,0.2992,2.8092,0.472,4.8039,1.3032,0.3621,0.0027,2.112,5.3292,2.1071,1.0689,0.2895,5.8054,0.9953,1.453,0.0003,1.1181,1.6699,3.99,2.7866,2.3553,3.1958,6.4102,4.5415,4.9665,3.34,1.8441,3.966,0.4901,0.8405,0.1659,0.0534,2.2227,0.2123,4.6815,1.8549,1.0031,0.0013,0.6924,0.263,5.0303,2.5245,1.1792,2.8863,3.9519,1.4185,3.4511,0.7027,0.3113,0.1178,0.9317,4.0443,3.0518,2.6017,3.892,5.4603,0.6678,2.8457,1.1483,1.1586,4.6793,2.9884,4.0137,1.2687,2.893,0.7247,0.189,1.2271,3.6399,0.0032,0.0054,0.0002,0.0002,0.0063,0.496,0.853,2.4513,1.8328,1.0351,2.8446,0.5199,0.0003,5.0851,4.8266,4.8878,3.7612,5.7273,1.3974,3.7313,1.586,2.6408,3.4422,0.6115,0.2354,4.8261,5.7857,0.9648,1.5396,3.3773,1.2438,3.1362,1.3976,0.0009,1.0015,1.2742,1.6489,4.6588,0.8924,1.2855,0.5452,2.3076,1.6725,0.702,3.1537,1.7307,2.0651,7.2156,0.2598,6.5337,4.0934,0.0855,0.2787,2.8,3.1071,2.5478,1.67,0.7986,5.2705,1.4877,3.2881,4.0989,6.3013,0.5114,0.4591,4.5957,3.2807,5.4994,3.2811,0.2465,2.8126,1.5191,0.1708,0.1137,0.0003,0.5255,2.4117,4.1799,0.4285,3.8416,3.8442,0.9884,6.4542,2.2309,3.3217,2.0576,3.2487,2.2515,2.7722,0.0514,3.6298,3.1932,1.3163,0.5204,0.0008,0.02,0.0709,1.0196,0.0002,3.5345,0.1552,0.0,0.0004,0.0001,0.0002,0.0613,0.0001,0.0122,0.0011,0.0,0.0002,0.3891,4.7052,3.9954,4.5215,4.051,3.7645,4.0863]}

{"id":1166,"ended":false,"length":265,"gen_text":"Reviewing the film, The Hindu wrote : `` An out and out action flick, one can see the director's thirst to cash in on the audience craze for such films. Nevertheless, 'Nimrat' is a film that will delight many while at the opposite end disturbing those who cannot make up their mind about its social content. There's a lot of action, a lot of violence but there is nothing that is gratuitous or objectionable.'' In its review, Tehelka wrote : `` 'Nimrat' is much less sensational than you might guess from its name, and the violence is actually very well concealed. The story revolves around a gang of three men and a woman who have come from the city for a job ` as bounty hunters with a wealthy industrialist. There's one more woman member, a rich girl who is trying to marry another wealthy man and keep her love for him secret. When they land a job that demands the men to take a woman off the street, it is not to an arranged marriage but to the `goddess' herself. The whole film takes place in a single day, the men in separate cars as they head to Mumbai for the contract on a young woman. At one point the gang is driven by members of an anti-terrorist brigade, the sort of gang who often get hired by rich politicians for the ` right '.''","token_len":278,"entropy":[4.2236,1.517,5.2677,1.1119,4.0344,6.4316,2.615,4.9179,8.1512,9.1081,7.1516,3.5243,0.0949,4.892,2.8609,1.1045,6.0349,2.3488,2.5385,1.7028,3.9785,0.8616,8.36,1.6467,6.5092,0.0326,0.2044,0.5158,6.5429,6.6458,0.0092,0.3851,2.964,1.2874,0.7619,7.5459,0.0796,5.0324,4.8786,3.5562,1.6966,0.9728,1.0927,1.1241,2.6652,0.8502,2.5901,4.7357,3.864,5.8559,4.1432,0.0146,9.3042,0.3602,6.5267,2.3194,0.2844,4.4787,6.0828,2.1118,0.0045,0.9041,1.5187,2.175,5.4538,3.3533,0.5525,4.3484,2.698,1.3994,2.0429,0.4513,2.9514,1.6493,2.3195,0.3112,0.0192,3.2911,3.2059,2.7151,1.1583,3.3757,1.4447,2.0932,2.901,0.1836,1.5146,4.7787,2.2512,3.977,3.676,0.5587,0.5527,5.2701,0.0267,0.0006,1.5498,0.434,0.0305,3.5808,0.0509,0.0014,0.0279,0.0644,0.5493,6.4133,4.4776,4.326,0.5097,4.9443,1.0348,5.4316,0.7633,1.0869,2.3601,2.2649,1.7689,2.4626,2.4786,0.6926,5.1703,3.225,2.8914,4.9161,0.4435,1.7244,2.99,3.0181,0.0273,0.6931,3.1684,0.555,3.7853,2.7785,3.0747,1.1259,0.7548,0.8911,2.6376,3.3068,2.5078,1.9163,2.7725,3.0335,0.6123,1.8,8.1488,6.1963,4.2604,0.1381,6.3664,1.4394,6.018,3.0781,0.0034,0.9588,4.3876,1.3439,4.5261,3.427,2.6578,5.953,1.6209,1.6337,5.8492,2.8388,1.1106,1.5825,4.9005,0.0528,4.5006,5.2324,3.2222,0.86,2.2905,5.2373,0.7068,5.3271,2.2463,1.5793,2.5613,0.3338,3.431,1.906,3.4435,2.9113,0.3344,3.6216,4.5136,3.2684,1.8978,1.0559,3.4637,2.0782,3.4398,5.2428,0.2989,0.9896,0.5485,3.1692,2.3089,2.9418,4.0968,5.1121,3.6027,0.0281,0.7582,0.3227,2.4109,4.9535,5.0612,1.936,0.0239,0.3204,3.919,0.4968,1.4376,4.6252,1.4965,3.8349,0.1721,0.6589,1.0107,2.7002,0.788,1.2269,3.4804,1.9433,4.0161,6.0268,2.1578,3.9569,0.5749,4.0389,0.7935,6.0662,2.632,0.4596,4.499,5.427,1.7272,2.4771,0.4292,0.7989,4.3924,2.2031,0.2254,1.8503,2.8021,1.9691,4.9417,1.4334,6.4665,0.0628,3.411,3.9186,0.0196,4.088,4.0644,1.7453,3.2156,5.9147,0.4411,5.4963,2.8261,4.8602,2.9368,4.8437,0.9854,2.8425,5.1936,2.9266,2.6133,3.4329,7.509,1.6943,2.928]}

She has been forced to become a hunter of criminals before she @ - @ finds out that her own family, and the plane he was on, are also on the plane crash, and that the victims are all the children she @ - @ nursed. The flight went fine and they all survived, but when they arrived at the airport to go to see their loved ones, they found out that one of the women they know was a monster, trying to kill another passenger on the plane.

They both are taken to an asylum, but Emma has taken on a second identity, while the stranger goes through the asylum and kills more patients. The woman he kills is really the mother of Emma's sister, and the real tragedy is that Emma can't help herself when she becomes very absorbed by her grief, causing her to kill the other patients.

{"id":1895,"ended":false,"length":235,"gen_text":"Condoms are often used in sex education programs, because they have the capability to reduce the chances of pregnancy and the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases when used correctly. A recent American study showed that one in 10 college-aged women in the United States has used a condom in sexual intercourse with a partner for less than three months. Condom use can also reduce the likelihood of a sexually transmitted disease (STDs), such as syphilis and herpes. Women who use condoms reduce their chances of contracting a sexually transmitted disease, and the number of infections that can occur. However, it is easy to forget or mistake condoms or have them break, and you still need to use them. To help ensure that you are using them properly and correctly, we've created our infographic highlighting 4 tips on how to use a condoms correctly: 1. Lubricate the tip of the condom to make it easier to grasp. 2. Make sure the center band can't slip during thrusting, otherwise the tip can slip out. 3. Ensure there is enough lubrication inside the condom to make it easy to slip during intercourse. 4. Avoid getting the condom stuck in your vagina.\nSOURCES: https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/std\/stats06\/10-16.htm (CDC) http:\/\/circumstitions.com\/sex-advice\/use-condoms.html","token_len":281,"entropy":[10.1618,1.8826,4.9551,1.6237,1.8265,4.1333,0.8369,2.1489,1.5881,4.1278,0.6467,3.5642,1.7836,5.1311,0.6179,2.8104,0.3771,4.2696,0.0806,1.9087,1.6488,3.2817,0.9409,0.0023,6.0037,0.6876,0.0331,0.4222,7.0391,0.2266,0.9051,0.3526,4.2635,3.2976,5.8661,2.27,2.2736,0.1238,4.8869,0.944,3.1843,3.371,2.2294,0.572,0.5849,2.4378,0.2885,0.9489,0.006,1.6952,1.2582,0.3121,0.1146,2.2035,3.3904,0.2989,4.9557,0.7323,1.0142,5.5329,2.5636,0.0082,2.2541,0.2959,0.3426,4.346,2.0503,0.1834,3.0158,0.9516,1.1453,0.1689,3.0866,0.1203,2.8583,1.7999,0.005,0.2869,1.8724,1.0403,1.9779,1.7948,1.0912,0.0012,3.1242,0.0019,1.4156,2.1194,0.9492,5.8179,0.6067,0.8599,0.3647,6.9743,0.3889,1.3387,0.02,2.3564,2.2987,0.3895,0.0087,0.2044,2.651,1.8442,2.6962,3.0608,0.0352,2.077,1.3387,1.9086,1.5067,2.064,3.1768,0.004,3.4147,0.4472,6.5579,0.3511,0.9929,3.1165,5.1498,1.8497,3.997,3.8173,0.8918,0.3758,1.4925,1.5694,5.1039,4.35,2.1722,0.0323,0.7127,0.5311,2.2652,4.2135,2.2463,2.4496,0.5281,0.3617,1.2391,0.2766,2.0424,1.7986,2.2436,1.8383,0.097,3.5227,2.3045,2.0985,4.1165,3.7262,4.5429,6.5283,2.7848,2.5669,0.7324,0.0527,0.6794,1.0836,5.2741,0.6897,2.7595,2.5632,0.2386,4.8148,0.2959,0.3416,1.3078,1.5688,0.5612,0.1387,0.0709,3.223,1.5883,0.2281,0.4664,0.1091,3.7896,1.0104,0.432,0.0015,2.908,0.0612,0.7315,5.3322,5.434,6.2004,1.9914,1.4081,5.7087,4.9619,0.0148,2.2504,3.3793,1.4147,2.3671,2.3462,1.1074,0.8782,0.9494,0.106,0.0015,4.1638,3.9603,0.4719,1.1042,0.7706,0.4924,2.9877,0.1383,0.2119,0.9725,2.3147,0.3456,1.2497,0.1038,1.8938,5.9729,1.5566,0.1846,0.0739,0.0008,3.9305,3.2933,0.9547,0.7643,1.8296,1.3355,1.58,0.9799,1.5046,1.9854,10.4552,3.5478,0.0563,0.005,0.4155,6.1083,0.0003,0.2914,0.0019,0.5119,0.0042,0.0007,0.0,0.0175,1.0384,0.0156,0.604,5.3686,0.0993,4.6744,1.9766,4.0068,1.2099,0.8028,4.139,0.8934,0.7228,0.8135,0.0002,6.595,1.5985,0.0728,0.0433,0.155,1.0327,0.0333,3.0181,0.418,4.927,0.0219,0.3691,3.6466,0.0244,0.2066,0.2155,2.5629,0.272]}
{"id":3778,"ended":false,"length":275,"gen_text":"In 1919, the highway that is now M @ - @ 99 was first signed as M @ - @ 64 from the Ohio state line to Hillsdale and as M @ - @ 79 from Hillsdale to the intersection of M \/ @ 98 (later dubbed M \/ @ 99.)\n\nIn 1921, M @ - @ 99 was opened for traffic to accommodate several freight trains a day, and later became an inter-urban main line. By 1927, the line was largely unused. The area around P \/ \/, west of what is today M \/ @ 99 and east of what is today the intersection of M \/ \/ & 99 was developed with hotels, commercial offices, and subdivisions. The Cleveland Rapid Transit District (CRTB), which served the downtown with bus rapid transit, had been operating M \/ @ 99 by 1929. As a result of the rapid transit lines, cars began running into the terminal where the train stopped. In 1949, the line was converted to electric and the terminals were closed.

Her design was based on experience gained with previous naval cruisers that were built between 1810 and 1824. The design was based around a broad bow with a single forward 5 knot propeller.\n\nAn interesting feature of the ships was that her fore and aft sponsons were separated using riveted bulkheads, similar to other ships of the period. She also used a single funnel on each fore and aft deck.\n\nThe Admiralty were concerned that the new class would have to replace the older ships so decided to set up a system of development and evaluation for future warships. The first ship to be fitted with a new design was HMAS Furious, which was completed in 1921. The new ship, named after her designer, R.J. Ferguson, was launched in 1922 and entered service in March 1922. She was replaced by the new HMS Furious which was built in 1924 and entered service in October 1925.\n\nThe second design to enter service with the RAN was HMAS Furious 2, named in honour of Capt. R.J. Ferguson and entered service in April 1922. She was replaced in 1929 by HMS Furious 3. Both ships underwent a number of alterations to give the ships some distinctiveness, which was appreciated by the Admiralty.","token_len":281,"entropy":[8.0249,6.7675,9.0665,3.7995,4.3554,2.5047,6.9602,1.2115,1.3842,3.096,7.7582,0.8114,2.8411,2.4993,0.807,4.9652,1.7094,9.3609,2.3333,0.0689,6.1091,4.994,6.1965,0.0708,2.8622,2.5894,0.2546,3.9472,5.5098,0.853,2.3609,0.1748,8.3749,0.9151,2.4155,5.8794,4.4825,4.3488,0.0003,5.1053,1.8195,1.8293,3.4591,2.0265,5.5942,0.098,0.4214,4.0028,0.4718,1.8114,3.135,1.147,2.4957,3.2497,0.9481,4.3986,4.071,1.2587,0.8985,2.7304,4.4975,4.8357,6.9781,0.2041,0.0025,1.4392,2.7051,0.0098,5.4917,3.4295,0.7249,0.3194,0.4483,4.7193,1.3175,1.2608,2.3292,4.3132,1.6349,0.3436,5.8391,0.1216,0.3239,2.7933,5.8813,5.6941,1.8172,4.1919,0.0209,1.7619,4.6081,0.0322,4.2633,2.3576,0.4904,0.6931,2.1445,0.264,2.8227,2.7428,3.0114,1.4132,2.7571,3.3407,3.2179,1.6429,5.0364,0.5202,0.044,1.6266,0.6921,1.2028,0.0002,1.4624,5.6388,0.0027,4.954,2.6637,0.7462,0.8465,3.1932,3.6156,1.434,2.9044,1.3022,4.3582,0.9437,2.6346,0.9332,4.3978,2.4652,0.2502,5.6845,0.7819,0.4156,5.3141,0.5575,5.8088,2.2482,3.8839,2.7892,3.8048,2.2773,0.3662,1.3782,2.1846,1.385,1.6598,0.4126,3.0668,0.14,1.4795,1.9865,2.3848,0.2902,4.3961,0.8671,3.7293,1.2961,0.9806,0.5001,2.4907,0.2283,2.6981,0.5269,1.9511,2.8183,1.6811,3.517,2.9943,1.5796,1.5798,2.0971,0.3199,5.6303,0.5473,3.2612,0.0117,3.636,0.1592,0.55,3.4587,1.1894,2.1925,0.93,2.7449,0.2192,0.6251,3.2607,3.6971,0.1836,1.9905,0.6384,3.6539,0.6812,2.199,2.4976,1.7128,0.7751,3.3194,0.9912,3.8807,0.7588,1.1538,1.2801,0.5618,0.0454,0.1548,2.7612,1.9215,0.0623,0.6079,0.0002,1.4426,3.7759,4.4414,2.1516,2.6767,0.0706,2.7793,0.4114,5.4644,0.2531,0.3023,1.3336,0.0328,1.1697,3.9347,1.0158,4.6883,2.807,0.2598,0.0038,6.8685,0.3865,1.6587,0.0358,0.3511,0.0065,0.1216,3.0126,3.0689,0.0594,0.1333,3.5983,3.2298,0.0895,1.4423,0.2373,0.5814,1.5565,4.3902,0.0993,1.6889,0.1964,0.8662,1.3002,4.5014,0.6368,5.0238,2.1971,1.44,0.0029,2.8554,2.6057,5.0611,2.6712,1.3193,5.5656,4.1793,1.7655,1.9723,3.0778,1.7533,3.9089,0.149,0.2926,0.432,0.0006,0.3369]}

This regional presence is what allows the region to participate in world shipping. The airline fleet operated by the regional carrier can perform the services that have become so critical to the economic development of the region, with a global connectivity.\n\nIn 2007, the government of Greenland took important steps to establish a strategic alliance with the United States, which makes it easier for American companies to build supply bases in Greenland.\n\nIn late 2007, the government of Greenland, with the approval of the Government and the Greenlandic Parliament, approved plans for building the second world headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in Nuuk, on Greenland's coast. Nuuk, like other North Atlantic countries, has a strong interest in securing its own strategic influence in the region, through the creation of a stable, reliable alliance (the Arctic Council).","token_len":281,"entropy":[8.8854,0.7083,1.1563,10.6461,7.3254,0.4448,1.3654,1.8831,5.5488,4.0028,0.1147,9.5717,0.9151,3.6886,6.4016,5.1709,0.1537,10.2734,7.0741,1.3046,3.1364,7.0668,3.7022,15.8553,7.8538,12.1103,7.9719,3.3012,3.0007,3.2778,7.8126,0.4736,0.1235,6.2238,1.0347,7.536,1.8826,1.0689,3.3102,2.6024,1.4257,2.915,3.1076,1.1621,5.1537,1.4232,0.0851,4.1356,4.9758,3.7057,2.6089,3.0194,3.5896,0.0439,6.0354,0.1524,0.3452,4.1342,4.7436,1.378,1.7717,0.1585,0.555,0.0259,0.4129,0.7243,0.0129,0.0925,2.9121,1.1098,1.2024,0.0173,1.5489,4.4165,0.0192,2.4761,2.3736,5.6736,1.5182,1.6932,2.4522,2.8021,1.6612,4.1862,2.5743,2.9342,0.4538,2.6401,1.6662,0.6495,2.1768,0.7722,2.8801,0.0002,1.3968,2.8595,0.0304,1.0932,2.4375,0.9955,4.4135,2.0588,0.7042,4.2201,0.1755,0.5593,5.3088,0.124,6.7717,1.1439,0.9673,1.4012,0.4775,3.2856,3.868,6.0583,1.92,5.4454,1.9876,1.3231,1.6353,0.0559,3.5413,0.3685,3.7608,5.5886,2.2312,2.2557,3.3208,3.7383,4.1581,0.1737,0.5793,0.7751,0.1496,4.154,5.6518,2.4717,3.429,2.0526,4.0283,2.7056,2.4729,3.3289,0.8806,0.8173,2.7641,1.1232,0.1145,0.3678,0.3978,2.2205,4.1774,2.3186,3.9408,6.5506,1.2951,0.501,0.0002,2.8227,4.633,0.5503,0.6477,3.0999,0.9799,0.0614,4.7115,5.1799,0.2086,0.568,3.0789,0.7199,3.9216,4.1972,0.2236,0.7946,1.3812,0.2401,1.8452,2.3561,5.8148,1.3736,2.0676,0.3277,2.9131,0.8286,0.1542,5.3835,5.7438,1.9163,0.6212,0.2936,0.4337,0.8151,0.0002,2.3053,5.5775,1.8998,0.1957,0.6112,1.2044,0.207,0.0319,3.7867,2.2171,0.4659,3.8407,0.0342,0.2284,4.0347,4.3929,1.3257,2.7338,0.2994,0.5182,0.1266,3.4347,4.6444,1.0046,4.3197,1.9597,3.8508,5.5005,2.6824,0.5788,0.4641,4.0527,0.1274,0.2885,0.612,0.2471,0.0233,0.0005,0.8011,0.3256,0.8331,0.0078,1.0839,4.0358,2.593,0.1655,3.861,0.2043,5.8943,0.0006,2.9659,4.153,2.575,3.3572,0.08,2.1222,0.1356,1.3008,1.713,1.8683,2.1391,0.0197,4.5911,1.4377,2.2233,2.5304,5.5876,0.9195,0.2336,1.3108,1.9885,3.4962,1.4223,2.6562,0.0324,0.6785,4.6511,2.6295,3.0576,5.1609,7.2523,2.7161,3.8551,1.4087,0.7707]}

The wave moved west, but it was not until it moved across the Caribbean Sea that the wave's convection organized and moved over the Bahamas in the Atlantic Ocean.\nIt was the first time a tropical wave formed in the Atlantic Ocean for 13 months, although previous waves in the ocean have formed several times since a cold front formed into tropical storm Harvey in late June.\nThe Gulf of Mexico hurricane season ends on Sept. 16.\nThe latest advisory on Tropical Storm Harvey from the National Hurricane Center:\nThe most interesting news is the new track, the new intensity, and the new track is set up to move toward the western Caribbean Sea and Bahamas on Saturday afternoon\/ evening into the second week of September. This will be an area where this disturbance will track with what appears to be a slow-moving storm. This will slow the formation of the deep convection, which will allow the front of Harvey to move east-northeastward, and there is a high probability we will hit the Texas coast, so some of the winds won't be as good. Also, given the location of the trough of low pressure that moves over the central Gulf, this will be the type of low pressure that will continue to weaken during the next few days, leaving us with the possibility of a Harvey-like impact on the Texas coast.","token_len":281,"entropy":[10.2496,6.0238,5.6564,4.3442,0.381,0.876,0.1079,3.9159,2.2471,3.3092,3.3239,1.9957,1.7291,2.5693,5.1309,3.0752,2.8331,3.4018,1.9315,1.886,1.7266,4.5494,2.2202,3.6372,3.3127,0.288,4.4191,1.104,0.7377,1.6601,3.8354,3.8294,10.6229,0.2464,9.8357,1.9642,3.783,3.102,0.5491,2.7375,4.5651,1.1481,3.1989,0.1845,0.3277,1.4358,11.1132,1.4715,2.2049,0.8041,0.725,1.3241,0.3291,0.3678,4.0925,0.8192,0.1498,0.6595,0.641,4.8211,5.5335,2.5883,1.2834,5.6166,4.7114,2.3975,2.7412,0.435,4.4742,1.55,1.0198,4.5772,0.0586,2.3783,6.1224,4.3964,0.1576,4.0953,7.0874,5.4294,0.8282,4.6035,0.9556,0.8425,5.7762,0.1296,0.4184,1.4207,5.324,0.8228,0.0258,3.5622,0.4031,3.3413,0.8147,1.7776,0.0058,3.894,0.9362,1.1451,1.8581,4.0713,4.6405,3.9973,2.2179,0.1255,0.6955,2.0873,0.1036,0.1924,0.0531,0.0016,3.5359,0.5581,2.3472,4.8662,6.3467,3.6633,2.0829,1.7344,4.4279,3.4876,3.85,3.5945,3.2269,2.4473,0.672,0.892,0.2513,0.6114,2.1819,2.4909,5.5308,3.2705,1.0117,2.7019,4.0482,0.3334,3.88,1.2728,0.4746,1.684,4.7534,2.8539,2.6122,3.6915,2.5816,3.7624,5.2025,2.1789,5.803,1.6835,0.0913,0.5257,0.3471,2.4194,2.0202,1.3345,2.9955,2.6834,2.4056,4.1912,5.7756,0.8755,3.9306,3.6834,6.0324,3.772,0.026,0.024,0.6428,5.1517,1.2121,0.1291,3.5331,1.6396,2.1574,1.5637,5.416,0.9967,5.8389,0.3599,1.0219,6.3404,0.1862,0.0414,1.9646,1.3429,1.0799,1.9687,0.8395,3.4325,2.7232,1.083,0.1052,1.6601,3.3502,2.2081,0.2371,0.0006,0.0039,1.7199,2.6341,2.0936,5.6108,1.2518,0.8629,3.1801,0.8372,5.0093,0.5226,7.3808,0.5985,2.6737,0.2643,4.0084,4.2701,5.9072,2.3206,0.5911,4.8926,7.0464,0.0011,0.2904,0.586,5.9175,1.72,4.8596,0.1993,5.435,0.4289,3.2763,0.3892,0.6192,3.8228,3.2138,0.2864,0.0125,1.387,5.2183,1.4419,0.3606,2.2179,2.2167,2.6797,2.7941,1.1265,1.347,2.3943,4.5558,0.011,1.7439,0.6644,1.3947,1.1467,4.102,0.2278,4.3485,4.1561,0.2414,1.0004,1.4539,0.0739,1.4868,5.394,2.0074,0.3431,2.0993,1.7056,0.2759,0.8743,5.5759,0.3835,0.662,3.1905,1.5505,0.4068,0.3548,0.0667,0.6496]}

The couple had five children although one died in infancy. Upon discharge from the military in October 1917, Andrew returned to Nottingham and worked as a weaver. After his discharge in September 1916, he did not take any further employment until February-March 1918. Andrew returned to America in autumn 1918 with Bessie.\nWith Bessie's father Robert, and brother James, Andrew and his three older sisters and mother had lived in Nottingham, where they were called to the North Riding Police for their schooling. Andrew had finished his education with the use of schoolbooks. In the spring and summer of 1919, Andrew and Bessie returned to Nottingham with Andrew's sister, Sarah, and mother to live near his father. As a young policeman Andrew was attached to the North Riding Police Station. It was in this police station where Andrew married Bessie. He also got to know John Smith, whose name he never forgets.\nBefore the Great War Andrew Ball was living in his brother's workshop. At the end of June 1918, Andrew was promoted from Constable to a Lieutenant. As he was already married, Andrew began to work longer hours and he was transferred to Middlesborough. On 24 August 1919, Andrew became First Sergeant in the Middlesborough Regiment.

It was also an attempt at making the sidepods heavier making the car less of a draggy.\n\nFernando Alonso said in 2009:\n\n\"If there's not a performance gap to the competition, you can't fight for the championship.\"\n\n2006\/2006 (Chassis 962), 2010\/2011, 2014\/2015 (Chassis 962R)","token_len":283,"entropy":[6.3529,0.1097,2.6725,6.5523,2.5211,7.4521,2.4258,0.8165,2.6303,5.3832,7.2136,1.6443,5.5292,6.1764,0.9738,1.326,12.7612,13.6409,4.9502,6.2132,5.8584,5.0527,7.0625,0.8897,3.0243,0.9509,1.1353,1.1092,4.2921,0.63,5.1077,5.386,5.2246,2.9602,0.9198,6.6555,0.3409,0.0003,3.6927,1.1617,2.7874,4.7035,4.1001,0.358,1.5692,2.1321,5.9574,5.1552,4.3775,0.8856,1.5076,0.507,6.8522,3.0579,5.8815,2.4022,0.4196,0.2016,3.131,5.2241,4.9148,0.7945,1.3549,4.4632,3.2203,2.7067,0.1087,1.9276,0.008,3.2951,0.9296,2.6411,3.2909,0.3967,1.7561,3.1285,4.4007,1.0777,0.0512,2.6711,0.2475,0.1289,1.4465,1.3705,1.3501,4.0515,3.8708,4.5588,1.3124,3.3751,0.3613,3.0972,5.5867,4.0297,3.9495,0.0206,2.9285,0.3386,0.0055,0.0002,4.7583,0.0022,0.4032,1.1711,3.7168,5.1029,0.8857,5.99,0.079,4.0332,4.8287,0.2261,0.5453,0.0215,1.7717,3.1252,2.8238,2.5347,4.4034,0.1148,1.7561,5.8526,5.0332,2.3094,3.2937,4.1168,4.8581,1.4936,0.107,2.7002,4.7106,3.0357,1.1704,1.1143,0.4956,3.4526,1.3368,5.332,5.1744,1.4368,0.6005,0.95,4.7708,3.1219,1.9312,4.4665,3.9728,2.4479,0.4446,3.2217,2.9057,0.5368,2.5883,4.2936,6.6147,4.0285,3.195,2.7831,5.6403,2.7526,0.6993,1.6513,5.5639,0.0963,0.3501,5.0196,1.3554,2.904,4.643,1.2133,0.1411,1.1885,0.6074,5.6217,2.8431,2.5321,4.6524,0.3715,4.9453,3.4782,0.6517,0.7288,0.885,3.0072,5.48,4.1464,0.1946,0.001,1.4772,2.0598,5.573,0.001,3.804,4.7738,1.4841,0.6438,3.2092,2.4097,5.5991,1.8983,0.7792,2.056,3.1447,0.9444,4.5105,0.6183,2.0026,4.8401,2.8817,3.625,2.028,0.2831,7.3796,0.2424,0.0004,5.4598,6.6954,0.9516,0.5788,2.6664,3.8128,0.1774,2.792,1.4739,3.0577,1.0401,0.0004,2.9419,5.6049,0.0004,0.0029,4.6897,2.1736,3.5905,1.3974,1.3927,0.0002,0.3504,4.3853,4.2383,1.7461,4.4237,0.8078,4.7391,2.2434,2.8423,1.484,3.6206,0.5289,2.8471,1.5857,0.6923,4.7807,1.2662,0.44,0.3636,2.2288,0.2069,0.0002,6.1814,4.2741,5.8275,4.0664,4.5483,0.582,3.6271,4.4961,5.1953,4.8346,0.3532,0.2422,3.967,1.461,0.3047,0.0893,0.8109,0.1432,0.0007,0.1965,1.2256,6.2295,0.7003]}

His reputation in literary circles took a blow from a malicious caricature in Somerset Maugham's novel 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' (1934).\n\nBiographical details\n\nWalpole was born in Northampton in 1830. He grew up in the English town of Bath, and later attended Eton and Oxford where he began his career of literary criticism after his graduation. He received a doctorate in theology and canon law, and later he became a professor of theology at Northampton College, Oxford.\n\nHe married Margaret Chirbes Walpole in 1848 and the couple had nine children. His brother Charles was also a Cambridge graduate, with a BA degree, and a teacher at St Augustine's College.\n\nWalpole died in May 1922 at the age of 58 in England.\n\nDeath\n\nIn a letter published in the New York Times, Walpole's biographer and friend, Charles Moore, wrote: \"He died after a short, slow illness during which the world seemed to have stopped. He had not received any treatment for cancer of the throat for several months, and had a few painful operations. But his death from pneumonia was so very sudden, so sudden, in fact, that the doctors did not know whether he was conscious when he passed away.\"","token_len":284,"entropy":[1.9535,6.1897,0.0915,0.2901,4.8131,7.8774,5.6782,7.1545,4.4121,4.5133,0.0982,5.2881,7.3836,0.7929,3.6386,9.4055,0.9466,0.4143,7.5466,1.1633,2.6005,4.6418,3.843,2.6972,0.1013,4.7609,0.1699,4.605,3.0795,2.5035,9.5293,4.9571,1.0618,10.1526,0.0005,0.0,0.0003,0.0137,1.6916,4.4173,5.2806,2.5366,0.2311,0.0038,1.8419,0.0239,0.0067,0.0018,1.2405,0.4792,0.0997,3.0879,1.1339,2.2909,0.0031,7.4811,2.8525,1.7499,0.7403,0.0002,1.2409,0.0042,0.6261,0.1465,0.7478,4.5548,1.1227,1.9405,5.0809,0.9006,0.885,3.6264,0.0061,0.4938,1.699,4.1547,2.4537,0.1256,4.612,0.61,1.9364,2.7542,2.6069,3.4541,0.0033,2.2278,1.3977,4.5757,0.0858,4.4908,1.2022,1.6533,5.2231,2.5135,1.192,6.1645,2.6795,1.0517,0.9658,1.2834,4.7444,1.0998,1.8508,0.0082,0.4971,4.3803,2.6306,5.8228,0.0412,2.8518,0.6531,3.4671,5.3617,1.4417,0.6984,1.5679,0.3046,2.0484,0.5243,7.2317,0.3056,0.7961,1.5745,1.7699,0.3146,0.8547,0.0002,2.1852,1.95,4.3969,5.717,5.2596,6.0228,7.0221,0.0418,0.8054,0.3162,3.1356,1.6464,2.1442,0.1648,0.3745,4.0739,0.032,0.5036,2.4557,4.5975,3.5608,1.2291,2.2003,0.6256,5.3095,1.7625,1.2347,4.7109,0.9965,4.9045,2.5557,2.7458,0.7879,2.2894,4.4438,1.1686,2.6039,5.0801,0.0131,0.9802,1.4307,1.0,0.0002,0.7912,0.0017,3.5265,0.6767,4.882,4.962,1.6344,0.6883,0.0813,0.0017,4.098,2.5088,4.6691,0.4869,1.2972,0.0002,5.1065,0.7416,0.0003,3.19,3.0036,1.4397,3.9026,0.3491,1.1701,2.2381,0.3778,0.2455,1.5376,1.0644,0.0018,0.3904,3.3245,0.0648,3.435,0.639,1.6547,3.7509,5.2763,0.2712,1.3063,0.9265,0.4491,1.8633,0.7998,4.609,0.5366,2.0524,3.3742,5.1244,0.8845,6.2756,0.1102,3.0433,5.2492,2.6555,0.2832,2.4833,4.7242,2.037,1.5822,1.5704,3.1916,5.346,1.6202,3.9042,0.736,3.1844,2.3883,0.0613,2.8142,2.7679,2.0235,0.8397,1.0129,0.6446,2.4748,3.9478,4.4913,6.0328,2.0721,1.6576,3.7734,2.4389,2.5854,4.5644,2.649,1.0031,3.802,5.8732,0.4971,1.599,2.155,1.7599,1.2246,3.0464,0.4248,0.0373,0.1092,2.2175,2.3222,2.7131,0.0182,1.2049,2.2785,1.2018,1.1917,4.9125,1.86,0.2989,2.3966,0.81,0.7384]}

There are currently three main priority activities for the new management group, which will be implemented by the end of June 2015. The first is the development and deployment of the new traffic management programme. This will enable the city to better manage traffic in and around the football stadiums during the competition.\n\nThe second is the establishment of public transport in the areas around the stadiums and at regular intervals. This will give the public transport system the necessary flexibility to allow for the efficient movement of the fans during competition days.\n\nFinally, the group is working on a new mobility policy to ensure a coherent network of public transport, which covers all areas of the city. Currently, a large number of vehicles are allowed onto the streets, which makes it difficult for people to travel around the city during competition times. Also, the new traffic management policy will ensure that people travelling in the centre of the city are able to use the public transport during the World Cup.\n\nFinally, public transport during competition days will include the use of public transport lanes for the new vehicles, like taxis and trucks, in order to increase traffic flow.\n\nLast but not least, the group continues to develop the bus and subway systems so that they are able to handle the increased traffic during competition days.","token_len":289,"entropy":[7.2277,1.6903,0.0207,3.5346,6.9097,2.92,8.6255,1.1375,5.069,6.5478,0.767,6.3705,6.6121,3.6121,0.6827,4.2981,2.3319,0.4887,4.703,1.6115,0.0432,0.0037,2.0096,6.7666,11.0658,5.9147,1.2631,3.4649,0.8386,6.9875,2.286,2.5725,3.8745,0.8513,5.8475,1.4074,3.6498,3.4774,3.2289,4.887,4.2043,1.9548,0.6105,5.3335,4.1926,5.0141,2.2038,1.0841,1.3399,0.9541,2.2181,2.2076,0.7164,0.5084,0.0052,3.9188,1.8465,1.0762,2.2432,1.1752,1.2794,1.0616,3.1818,2.1539,3.8521,0.0201,1.3589,1.7416,4.6957,0.3328,5.566,1.7592,1.497,1.1931,3.8237,0.803,2.9546,0.2264,2.5875,0.4416,0.8988,3.2544,2.9094,0.5996,0.2309,5.5053,1.3311,2.3282,0.1897,3.8054,1.058,1.8628,0.0034,0.6598,0.5627,1.1313,0.3063,3.0043,0.0541,5.8389,0.6693,3.6413,0.6918,2.9813,1.338,0.1213,0.6235,2.004,4.0481,6.2133,0.2032,1.8928,1.3156,0.5242,4.6742,1.4159,1.3218,0.5325,1.101,1.6184,2.5183,1.4592,0.4674,4.1096,1.4756,1.1693,3.7764,1.7197,0.0539,2.198,2.5403,1.7211,5.4615,2.1221,0.3542,0.9663,0.0002,2.202,0.0447,0.6356,3.1851,1.6469,1.4639,0.8068,1.8391,2.0769,4.8807,2.3391,2.2306,2.2931,2.8404,4.9924,3.9142,0.6736,0.9128,0.1835,1.8072,2.9671,5.6544,1.298,2.0197,0.3425,0.3269,0.1114,1.0311,6.7592,0.293,3.8899,2.9721,0.7924,0.0034,2.8941,1.0452,5.1699,4.5247,0.3294,2.1558,2.4404,1.5604,3.1058,0.8314,0.425,0.5307,1.6839,0.2028,2.0871,1.9843,0.2488,0.1518,2.1069,1.598,4.267,0.1334,6.0868,0.0963,1.2064,3.7218,2.961,0.0891,3.0538,0.7743,3.3541,0.4457,3.9994,2.8214,2.1717,0.9546,4.2818,0.3769,0.2144,0.03,1.6246,0.6226,0.0061,2.3612,1.138,1.6661,0.0846,4.7088,0.6475,2.8847,0.0026,0.4611,0.4072,0.0002,4.7907,0.0147,5.2141,0.3141,3.0592,2.6596,0.4327,0.3606,4.7038,1.4411,1.2688,0.004,3.106,0.947,5.6251,2.9951,1.288,5.703,3.5053,1.5198,5.9452,3.2688,0.8079,4.259,0.8941,3.2665,0.7339,0.0328,3.5449,3.4719,0.4305,1.1889,0.894,0.0002,5.9697,1.1591,0.0218,0.0107,0.0287,0.5595,1.4309,4.9599,0.4052,2.605,0.8344,4.669,2.0056,3.5677,2.2174,4.795,0.185,0.6622,1.1319,1.7518,0.005,2.5931,0.3733,1.8632,0.6609,1.6854,1.8629,0.1002,0.1947]}

This may involve, without blame, noticing the emotional pain our own thoughts are causing others to feel or listening to the other person's distress because of those thoughts. Self - empathy also includes understanding and accepting the feelings of another in their time of distress as well as the other people's feelings.\nWith Self- empathy, we should seek and learn to be more empathetic in all areas of life, including where we are at that moment. Self - empathy is the foundation for Self-empathy. This model will help us develop more powerful self-esteem and confidence with our feelings.\nWith Self - empathy. our attention is drawn to our internal feelings and our ability to love ourselves. We also learn to know ourselves better and to love ourselves with our full heart.\nSelf - empathy encourages us to give ourselves time to deal with our inner feelings. We will learn to respond to our feelings in a loving and supportive way. Empathy enables us to grow and develop as people.\nFinally..

{"id":728,"ended":false,"length":270,"gen_text":"It was suggested by Edward Robinson that Jifna was < unk > of Benjamin, mentioned in the Book of Joshua as one of the `` twelve cities. `` Nothing thereafter is recorded in Hebrew nor in any other language of Canaan to indicate the name of the city by which Jifna was called. Dr. Kohn points out that the city, Jifna, is not a city of Canaan but is an entirely Arabian name, and is not found among Palestine texts after the sixteenth century. It is derived from the words jife, `bead,' and ney-fee, `a fish'.'' The city has been found to have two capitals, with one being built of pure sand; one with seven gates; and one with nine gates, with a wall about fifty feet high, which is probably the later. The stone found in Jifna was a rock, and probably the same rock as was used for the tomb. There were found the remains of a pyramid, with what appears to be part of an inscription in a language we now know to be Arabic, about three feet square. This monument was in good condition, the bones in excellent preservation, and the stone was very well worked. Dr. Kohn informs us that the city of Jifna is very ancient, dating from the earliest occupation of Palestine.

Holland's behavior at the time of the accident was consistent with other persons who have attempted to kill himself in order to obtain disability compensation, he said. When he learned that an injury he sustained during training would be taken into consideration before his benefits were reduced, Holland decided he would no longer attempt suicide. He had considered suicide at least twice before, he said.\n\nHe was interviewed after being released from confinement with two other co-defendants and the two commanders; he pleaded guilty but said he was not guilty of second-degree murder. The court found his actions to be deliberate. Holland served 20 years in prison before being released in 2008. He has been trying to get back into the service, but he said he has been turned away and is not optimistic. He left school with an Associate's Degree in mathematics, and after studying law, he got his J.D., with honors.\n\nHolland was also interviewed after the accident about the incident and about his personal life.

{"id":3901,"ended":false,"length":275,"gen_text":"Like his immediate predecessors, White took the job on condition that the reprints would be phased out. It was some time before this was achieved : there was at least one reprinted story in '85, in which the character's alter-ego, the superheroic Captain Universe, was caught in the wreckage of the exploding moon.\n\nWhile the series' production was not a failure, the lack of an ongoing title did not make it attractive for writers and artists to spend their entire careers in.\n\nIt is a wonder what might have happened if Superman had appeared on American TV, rather than the newfangled world being presented by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nA better question is why there were fewer characters in circulation than the Silver Age heroes. A few reasons: comic stories were long: by the late 1940s, more than 80 issues a month were being published in the US. The Golden Age wasn't a massive cultural phenomenon: some readers didn't mind long stories. And it was, of course, a very different world to the one that existed ten years earlier.\n\nAs a result, comics, as a cultural form, went through a renaissance. It's worth remembering that the Golden Age began when the average American household had only five televisions (and a TV set was a luxury even then).

This may include the deployment of a number of small ship-based buoys to monitor potentially severe winds and storm surge.\n\nWe will continue monitoring Hurricane Jose as it moves northward.\n\n[Related: 10 things to know about the impact of Hurricane Irma]\n\nThe latest update from NHC is above.","token_len":293,"entropy":[5.0707,2.4653,8.1793,4.0308,6.2429,12.2583,8.3052,7.621,13.1512,14.0448,4.4901,4.0067,3.8251,6.3583,2.2856,2.6306,3.004,3.8624,3.3614,2.1043,1.5878,4.3759,9.3464,2.4258,5.0934,3.0765,4.9739,0.0002,0.001,1.6667,2.3516,4.0949,0.0107,2.664,0.8098,1.6349,5.277,5.5909,5.9155,1.3877,5.7738,1.0405,0.9349,1.9534,1.9388,2.8714,4.0313,1.8205,6.5857,2.7715,0.028,3.2974,6.0509,0.0056,3.1932,1.9984,0.0862,0.0037,2.2883,5.9601,3.1322,3.1885,3.7646,0.5942,1.082,3.3166,2.9865,2.1976,0.0482,4.8524,5.0732,1.6325,1.6351,1.1255,0.4999,3.5801,3.1692,2.844,0.548,2.705,0.0002,0.0526,0.2444,0.8191,0.727,0.0002,3.2445,5.2248,3.2918,1.6977,0.6664,5.2645,3.4039,1.5066,1.0357,3.7633,0.1041,2.4058,0.4828,3.7913,3.5573,2.1249,0.6229,0.4519,3.7049,1.204,3.4428,0.0013,0.4102,1.006,6.2304,5.8537,1.1545,1.202,0.6796,1.5061,2.4408,1.8194,3.1466,4.7082,2.1509,0.1469,0.4379,3.7909,0.4408,2.8193,0.0296,0.2815,0.5228,0.0002,2.3287,2.6364,4.4869,2.2875,2.3593,0.1308,0.1209,1.1961,0.0477,1.0532,2.0915,2.7453,1.9058,4.2243,0.1107,0.6937,4.5637,0.3478,0.0137,0.6228,6.4118,1.8116,2.1908,0.6686,1.7,0.1218,1.5108,4.4553,0.9463,3.6829,0.8193,0.57,0.236,0.0013,0.4397,3.2102,0.8074,0.0025,0.0002,0.0058,1.086,1.0864,0.221,0.4573,0.0003,4.1822,3.2031,5.2107,1.8477,7.0132,0.1859,2.7874,1.6271,1.8488,1.7265,0.3416,4.9295,6.2011,0.2534,4.4508,4.3728,0.4796,4.7373,0.544,1.1523,3.0127,0.1115,3.0183,5.2898,5.9745,0.4036,1.1756,3.1891,0.8483,2.4728,4.8597,0.367,0.697,0.0477,2.9161,1.2743,3.4454,2.1399,4.3234,1.0316,1.4033,0.0452,0.1561,3.4475,1.2163,5.6615,0.3801,5.4867,0.2221,0.0032,1.3669,0.2185,4.6425,4.1628,0.63,1.9791,0.5214,0.0219,2.0154,5.6425,0.0076,3.1258,4.6154,0.9728,0.1074,3.0996,0.0001,1.5472,1.3711,7.2032,5.2021,3.9014,0.8628,1.28,0.1571,1.2305,0.4816,0.0003,5.2431,1.1804,1.2489,3.2516,2.8534,0.1059,2.1754,0.1567,0.9555,2.3901,0.7453,1.4215,1.8233,0.0002,4.2164,5.6856,0.0453,5.3709,2.2112,0.4335,0.1407,0.0738,1.929,4.9662,0.0774,0.351,2.6196,0.5106,0.1261,0.0002,2.5016,2.7935,2.7308,1.3289,4.0313,0.0106,1.8672,5.1058,0.2032]}

For example, on the opening track from the 2000 album The Chronic, Snoop Dogg mentions the \"feelin' funky, the feelin' funky, feeling funky!\" that he hears while listening to the album. In 2000 Eminem released The Slim Shady LP (aka The Marshall Mathers LP) with a track titled \"In Da Club,\" which is a combination of the opening lyrics of \"In Da Club,\" \"Bust a Lid,\" and \"Dumb It Down\" with the track's flow. The song received widespread acclaim for its use of the beat, flow and samples from Illmatic. As part of Shady's 2002 tour, the hit singles \"My Name Is\" and \"Mr. Me Too,\" as well as the track \"It's On\" from the 1998 album The Chronic, similarly featured a sample from Illmatic.\n\n\nTo date, there have been over 300 officially licensed Eminem mixes, and countless other unofficial remixes, which have all incorporated the album's musical themes.\n\nAlbum Covers\n\nTrack listing","token_len":294,"entropy":[9.7118,6.6469,4.8308,6.3113,5.1935,1.0785,5.2418,9.6782,1.241,0.9821,0.7623,1.5255,6.4413,10.708,3.6584,0.2684,1.5351,0.6383,3.9075,8.5632,2.1468,2.5964,12.0502,12.9361,2.3477,2.5898,2.7066,11.8242,2.191,0.1795,9.5726,1.1459,0.0179,0.1194,0.9504,9.0741,1.2408,1.1095,4.4576,1.372,0.3571,2.2153,0.2919,1.237,4.2014,0.343,3.3603,0.0002,4.5855,1.6265,4.0389,0.2836,0.355,3.1794,4.5251,6.1457,2.0487,1.4799,5.0752,0.0769,0.9,1.0745,0.0016,1.2795,5.5521,4.9235,3.7278,2.0244,0.5786,0.0418,4.9909,3.2189,0.3929,4.5589,0.169,1.7749,0.2327,0.1807,2.9044,0.3402,0.0872,4.1681,1.4336,5.538,0.7286,2.6252,1.7939,4.4192,0.8397,2.4861,3.8144,0.5009,2.5764,0.0004,0.034,0.0799,6.0059,1.1466,2.7063,7.1964,1.5049,0.2189,2.8838,2.7091,3.2305,3.1814,0.1041,0.0368,1.0491,1.1604,4.6263,0.474,4.8376,4.6239,1.7905,1.994,3.5229,1.0471,0.0111,1.6051,1.1942,0.5373,2.9784,4.123,5.5788,2.2918,1.8131,0.1558,0.0002,0.0,0.0169,3.3194,3.8744,0.3703,0.3977,0.0002,0.0,0.0,0.0004,1.4407,2.0456,1.1963,2.2251,1.5509,0.1761,5.1767,0.4497,0.0062,2.4648,0.5199,2.6655,1.1187,4.357,0.0192,1.0035,2.2795,3.1452,1.1535,1.1031,2.3196,0.09,0.0606,2.2302,1.3104,5.0047,1.1894,0.7169,3.9403,0.0644,0.6158,0.1383,0.3552,3.8126,2.8012,0.5614,0.0006,1.7118,2.462,0.932,3.9508,1.1149,5.3182,0.9539,2.4649,1.8026,4.7967,3.6797,2.0407,2.552,0.3889,4.1045,0.003,1.1621,3.7833,1.8597,4.3559,2.6987,3.4426,0.9427,0.3452,0.0005,0.42,5.2081,5.5911,0.0016,7.4401,0.001,0.7247,4.6143,2.73,0.2833,2.3894,6.1492,3.7804,0.0807,2.4898,0.0375,0.0419,0.1428,0.0848,0.0162,5.4067,0.0031,2.1509,0.001,2.8585,2.905,0.0046,0.0056,0.5586,3.2246,0.1196,4.8758,0.474,1.5798,0.5935,2.4087,1.0717,6.0139,0.2157,0.762,6.7512,0.4814,6.7608,2.8155,2.6623,1.7037,0.9291,0.4113,0.0007,0.33,0.8949,0.0003,5.3778,1.6717,0.2438,2.3136,0.9211,0.0989,2.037,3.7618,4.5149,0.5504,5.8035,5.9317,1.5612,2.6591,3.311,2.3726,1.1621,0.8589,0.0058,1.7602,3.6443,1.0863,3.1007,3.0884,1.3778,2.8587,0.1014,3.0895,2.0555,0.7579,3.4083,0.0001,5.5893,0.0424,3.9801,0.001,0.4943,0.0002,4.7257,2.1542]}
{"id":2440,"ended":true,"length":289,"gen_text":"Glenn Robinson III, son of former first overall NBA draft pick Glenn Robinson, verbally committed on September 14, 2010 as the first commitment in Michigan \u2019 s class of 2012. On February 2, 2013 Glenn Robinson III announced that he would be signing with Kentucky over Michigan State because he loved the program. Glenn did also announce that he has a new car that's customized to his new school logo. As part of the contract Glen committed to Kentucky for three years and will graduate in 2016. He received a verbal commitment in January and on April 10th announced he wanted to honor his commitment by taking a medical redshirt. The redshirt will allow him to play basketball in 2015 but he doesn't expect to have a major impact on the team because of the high attrition with last season's basketball team. If he fails to qualify by April 2015 Michigan State still can offer him a four year scholarship with the hope he will return but if he leaves after that it would make the situation a mess and probably end any chances they had of him returning there.

After freeing Prince Charming from her control, Rapunzel, who believes he's the Prince of Love, then sets out to save Snow White.\n\nCast","token_len":296,"entropy":[5.4634,0.1022,4.0486,13.1216,5.3741,0.9892,7.7873,3.1585,1.0171,0.1853,2.2985,6.5721,0.0644,1.0767,3.2609,0.4163,0.0,0.0002,2.1869,1.7499,1.065,8.3243,0.2757,0.002,0.848,5.3784,1.0147,0.5637,0.0196,3.7885,2.0381,1.4066,0.0692,0.0582,0.0425,0.8774,1.7029,0.0032,0.0981,3.9181,0.033,0.5181,3.2829,2.4103,0.7682,0.1775,0.1696,0.6623,2.5137,0.9159,0.9679,1.0961,1.9778,1.0143,0.418,0.3771,0.0027,3.9609,1.0572,2.5099,1.4622,3.2191,2.3412,1.5992,0.001,2.5817,1.3223,0.6547,1.2054,0.1424,0.3634,1.5721,2.9652,2.8536,0.0001,2.7193,2.6402,4.0942,2.2066,4.7567,5.9948,2.0474,5.611,0.9743,3.0713,1.0269,0.6628,4.1569,0.5514,2.0648,2.7261,2.1105,0.0181,6.5785,4.2911,1.6632,0.4296,5.8915,1.9021,1.4804,1.304,0.8654,0.0013,0.0148,1.6194,1.7209,0.7176,1.5664,1.1666,0.0007,4.1129,1.8535,1.38,2.1221,1.2236,3.8712,0.01,4.5427,0.8584,0.7016,0.2927,0.562,0.7584,0.0015,2.2283,4.8458,2.5619,1.1077,4.5245,0.7843,0.7469,1.5361,0.0325,0.0173,1.0729,4.0377,1.6915,0.0175,2.8083,1.9111,0.0059,0.0,4.7167,4.135,0.3371,0.8435,1.1094,3.5517,4.4009,1.1201,0.6062,0.5385,0.1181,2.2442,5.709,1.6328,5.5744,0.4636,5.8026,3.2868,1.0238,0.3778,2.3223,2.0416,0.0,0.0,0.135,3.6516,4.7628,2.6928,0.5495,0.9784,4.0985,2.2301,1.6771,1.235,2.996,5.446,1.6246,2.1451,2.0138,0.6462,2.4173,1.818,0.0225,0.108,0.001,4.1625,3.7814,7.0021,3.6389,1.07,4.4294,3.6491,1.4666,0.2734,0.1393,1.9392,0.4303,0.904,2.8465,3.6582,2.8049,3.5787,2.5397,4.1105,3.2061,1.1929,5.1697,2.8606,1.9425,2.3901,1.9264,6.5907,0.8729,0.0004,4.8117,3.7799,0.5271,0.0418,2.1128,1.4663,3.9742,1.9615,1.6898,3.4434,1.0077,2.17,0.0023,2.6033,4.4367,0.0035,0.0001,3.0053,1.8588,0.4159,0.2638,2.3827,1.9863,3.1068,0.4933,0.4514,0.2358,0.0025,3.2436,2.8815,4.5769,1.0656,0.2443,3.582,0.0005,0.0006,4.2423,1.5519,0.7244,2.7245,0.0005,0.1644,1.4845,1.8607,3.1183,0.4668,2.5066,2.0212,1.7133,0.0048,0.0006,1.8655,2.314,1.0625,0.1752,1.2586,0.0004,0.0009,3.6644,2.0618,5.0079,2.5584,2.5539,1.0319,1.5103,0.8246,3.9138,0.3238,5.6844,3.8104,0.5332,0.2289,2.3956,2.4476,0.0041,1.4319,1.6324,0.0002,3.0405]}

{"id":1245,"ended":true,"length":292,"gen_text":"In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually frugal man, told his son that not only must he gain admission to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, but he must also find the money for that tuition. He suggested that the son put the money aside, for he did have money. After all, the future Academy Award winner earned a fortune that winter. The money he could not put into the bank, he sold for scrap. And once he had enough money for his dream of becoming a public speaker, he spent most of it paying off his debts. Olivier then spent most of the rest of his life struggling to find a comfortable way to live, which was difficult because of the constant need for money. Olivier's early years as a public speaker, with his modest financial problems, were an important period of his life. He was a public speaker who struggled with a constant need for money. One of his first public speeches, delivered during the Great Depression, was about the need for money and the value it could have to an individual. And we now know that Olivier did have money. But the key to his success in life may well have been in his dedication to and belief in himself. As he explained to his son: I didn't have a lot of money but you can be sure I didn't want it to go to waste so I put every penny I had in the bank. He may not have been rich, but he wasn't poor.","token_len":296,"entropy":[9.5823,11.3385,8.058,1.8135,1.1884,12.4515,2.2825,5.592,0.5141,0.0095,1.4761,0.5741,5.9997,0.7662,3.0509,1.125,7.8406,0.7104,5.3061,0.2589,7.972,6.8698,0.1365,1.0911,7.8534,2.7625,0.3013,3.3574,8.8538,3.6062,5.6161,0.0256,1.9165,0.7241,0.6074,0.973,0.5227,0.8699,4.1478,2.5157,0.8062,1.4331,4.8158,3.618,0.5461,2.5047,5.0463,0.5115,1.288,2.2936,4.5072,1.7073,0.7536,1.9174,2.2034,4.1882,2.0199,3.8728,4.0138,3.3171,1.6294,4.3869,1.5377,0.0305,2.1772,5.6825,4.1948,0.5982,1.4473,4.4681,1.417,3.382,5.05,4.7129,1.666,3.041,3.9755,2.7354,4.3698,2.2012,2.6173,3.2337,0.9462,1.92,1.1613,1.9227,4.0922,3.5961,3.619,1.4418,4.1265,6.0577,0.9341,0.6892,3.7691,0.8887,2.6459,1.8586,6.3448,2.6379,1.8387,0.5845,5.1768,0.5229,0.128,0.191,3.095,3.995,0.0119,0.1913,6.8734,0.6525,0.9345,1.5111,0.3688,4.2395,3.9407,2.8814,2.5518,0.0068,0.8336,0.5898,0.0173,0.264,0.2359,5.4012,0.2297,2.916,1.4587,5.3116,2.6392,0.2225,1.8375,2.059,3.8678,2.4858,3.1909,1.3823,2.3717,1.3966,4.7995,2.6614,1.2594,0.7744,0.3131,3.8256,1.7688,5.4847,2.3407,2.5544,0.2329,1.9845,0.0194,2.9749,4.9068,1.1456,5.5991,4.4878,3.483,0.2885,2.095,3.2213,2.0063,2.847,1.2868,0.6724,0.323,0.5575,1.8421,2.0557,2.3469,3.5087,0.1084,2.4443,3.4373,1.3722,3.2638,4.498,0.3221,0.3243,0.1329,0.6271,5.2041,0.8794,1.1825,2.6147,0.9929,1.1581,1.6196,3.179,4.0661,0.761,2.4256,0.059,0.2919,0.8452,3.2861,1.1542,1.3426,0.4692,2.9243,2.5636,1.1392,4.6345,3.9643,2.6218,1.2071,2.5362,2.7815,0.3591,0.5499,4.2742,5.1122,4.8244,0.4758,0.3438,1.6863,3.3941,2.2212,0.9628,1.0353,1.9947,2.8108,5.061,1.1274,0.9684,1.2701,2.4503,2.6698,4.2009,2.9417,0.3605,0.0679,4.2004,1.1203,5.8635,0.0778,5.8487,3.7129,0.0454,2.2675,0.4013,3.6532,1.3697,3.4265,0.6693,0.2338,0.0897,1.7152,2.1199,4.4865,0.0007,1.9028,1.7867,2.1172,0.1679,0.1623,2.996,5.4418,2.3345,2.9763,1.0841,1.158,2.4824,0.0004,2.1577,0.9259,4.3025,1.2014,0.2568,0.1884,4.3207,0.2023,2.7786,4.1567,0.5566,0.7277,0.3265,1.8046,0.957,0.067,0.511,5.2532,4.8699,1.1225,0.0429,1.8184,1.8794,0.5908,0.0359,0.4045,3.5508,0.0004,1.0261,0.8516]}

He developed his own distinctive Italian style using recipes and techniques taken from the Italians, French, and English cuisines of the period. He based his culinary practices on the principles of gastronomy and alchemy described by the Greek physician Galen, who believed that by cooking food at high temperatures, the substances in it might be transformed by some superior force, which was then passed into the food to help cure, improve its flavour or enhance its medicinal properties.","token_len":298,"entropy":[7.6221,2.8287,3.0616,7.5328,1.1341,2.6061,7.9405,3.3806,10.093,5.5576,1.719,7.1504,11.6886,9.336,0.0765,3.4937,9.4775,7.2926,7.0958,0.1823,6.3937,2.4327,3.6377,4.1778,4.0603,6.8959,2.9118,10.367,0.404,1.6806,2.4419,7.6347,2.2923,4.2141,4.3299,4.6752,0.686,7.9031,0.9234,10.2592,1.2143,1.9458,4.0115,1.1199,2.0919,1.466,3.8253,0.0034,2.8814,2.3777,2.3696,4.9852,2.687,6.6464,1.9279,5.6697,0.0005,2.3771,3.1397,2.1431,5.877,1.0996,4.6791,3.1493,2.3766,0.5274,0.5387,0.0079,2.013,1.2224,1.0766,1.0598,4.0299,4.8971,3.0344,2.5615,5.6135,0.3373,5.4101,2.2389,3.5148,2.6708,1.0032,2.0999,1.2367,4.5833,4.4108,3.5376,1.5287,0.9881,0.0002,6.4127,0.0412,0.0018,5.3623,4.2694,4.5497,0.3502,0.2594,2.8146,0.3944,1.1943,2.2698,3.2867,0.0922,4.2805,5.7118,2.6148,3.4957,0.0124,0.5672,1.1824,1.5903,5.7168,2.6651,2.8045,4.2116,5.9864,2.9058,3.8906,0.6243,5.5878,0.0456,2.0265,0.6901,0.0006,5.0811,2.7989,2.2018,6.3037,0.6692,1.2347,1.2891,3.3993,5.6115,5.3563,0.7356,2.6758,0.5515,0.6112,3.0745,0.304,0.9141,4.5432,2.5721,3.1557,0.5691,1.025,1.2284,0.1888,0.7798,2.8249,1.4781,1.7655,0.0595,2.1761,3.1663,2.2381,3.0294,5.8512,0.0706,2.1346,0.4144,0.9951,7.9874,1.3485,0.6265,6.6752,1.6136,0.4321,0.0908,4.1895,0.1882,0.8637,0.0002,2.7961,0.0109,0.001,1.2203,4.7767,2.3422,1.5642,5.8964,0.3823,0.9748,5.0054,2.0554,2.4438,5.2094,0.0392,0.0713,5.1376,1.661,3.7606,3.3076,0.8325,2.2433,3.1084,0.2788,1.4182,2.3612,0.6909,3.0972,5.0531,0.389,3.7454,5.7365,1.6261,2.9752,4.4176,5.3483,1.538,6.3043,4.7124,3.3725,1.6512,4.9032,0.2293,1.254,4.8193,1.1687,1.7507,0.227,0.9542,1.6991,3.4991,0.002,0.0006,1.2215,0.8189,1.2355,0.2913,2.5028,4.696,0.2335,3.5651,5.0369,0.2242,0.8714,2.9437,0.1992,4.6049,0.0019,0.055,1.9008,4.6623,0.5317,7.1356,0.6377,1.2128,4.3911,1.3088,1.3217,0.0019,1.814,1.4124,4.049,0.1837,3.69,3.8063,1.773,2.7687,1.8806,0.4863,1.1799,1.9455,4.8651,2.0892,0.514,4.2293,0.5734,1.1298,3.1577,4.5284,6.2934,1.7898,2.4998,3.8738,2.4143,3.1062,3.1222,2.4782,0.4381,0.5397,2.7486,5.2625,3.947,2.8252,2.7556,3.9787,1.9048,2.2192,3.0505,0.0816,1.8709,0.5041,0.0661]}

Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian had already launched his campaign in Gaul. The armies of the Parthians and Suebi were in rebellion and all attempts to restore order were stifled by the new king of the Parthians, Mucianus. In 71, Vespasian was able to win back his throne and when the Parthian emperor ordered an attack on Rome he was defeated and his capital razed to the ground.\n\nHe was buried behind the Capitoline Hill with the remains of his mother and wife. After their deaths he never knew of his father's or brother's deeds with Roman authority. When he became emperor he decided to rebuild the temple of Mars, the former temple of Jupiter in the temple of Mausolus. The temple was rebuilt after a massive restoration during the reigns of the emperors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. Later it was dedicated to Hadrian who was honoured by being buried with the statue of a soldier wearing a Corinthian helmet in front of the sanctuary. In 69, during the third pontificate, Vespasian was assassinated in Rome when he was trying to get a visit with the emperor Hadrian. His assassination, like his mother's (and great grandfathers'), may well have been the work of one of the Senate.","token_len":303,"entropy":[1.4581,7.0951,3.389,4.8739,0.2287,1.0407,3.8715,5.226,0.0789,3.6678,3.1698,2.5987,0.0112,6.4027,0.0049,6.1003,0.83,7.9052,3.0951,2.5315,0.3388,7.231,0.0057,7.1194,5.6718,0.0935,0.0777,0.4526,8.2598,0.9347,11.5812,0.4415,3.0397,6.6047,2.0796,0.0255,0.0294,2.135,5.3096,5.5841,7.2373,4.7135,0.6646,0.0022,0.0002,2.4736,2.0177,5.1978,0.7813,1.7304,1.7518,1.7932,1.3841,2.0851,5.4168,0.5209,1.1585,4.0643,0.0006,0.4502,1.2115,5.108,0.8674,1.615,3.5146,4.8232,1.2489,5.3903,2.9753,0.8255,2.1864,0.2425,1.1715,5.2309,1.7491,1.1331,0.8415,4.6981,3.0952,2.2086,1.0469,0.4632,0.0034,0.0357,0.2868,3.2269,0.0987,0.0093,0.0804,1.4431,2.9011,2.9413,1.3362,1.1465,0.0461,0.001,0.0002,1.9765,2.498,0.0128,4.1724,2.4454,2.9005,2.5771,1.2787,5.5065,2.0007,1.8965,0.0012,1.159,4.2283,4.5426,2.5234,1.1504,0.1936,0.8626,3.1089,0.5729,2.4523,1.2563,3.3371,1.8313,5.0186,0.279,0.2907,0.0076,0.0021,0.1853,1.3196,0.0313,5.7326,1.6454,5.7456,7.4604,0.3296,2.0132,0.8152,0.6005,2.8325,1.7904,3.098,0.0221,0.5254,2.1344,1.156,2.7514,1.602,3.5933,5.4931,0.7499,2.3743,4.8783,5.321,2.5175,1.1236,0.8622,0.7202,3.8296,1.7634,0.0135,4.4693,6.6194,6.3766,3.0264,0.7582,3.7504,0.7659,2.2743,0.5828,0.9958,4.4111,0.3855,3.01,0.4594,2.1927,0.2705,2.8329,2.4526,1.5357,4.9223,1.9613,0.2183,1.0991,3.0506,0.7511,4.386,0.1314,5.5931,0.2731,0.1622,0.0077,1.488,1.8062,1.4038,0.7499,2.3112,4.0805,2.5458,5.0135,1.5986,5.3603,0.4772,0.0604,4.2159,0.0041,2.6069,2.1398,0.0127,2.8974,0.0002,0.266,0.9063,0.0136,0.1975,0.0002,0.5494,4.8443,2.6506,0.377,3.9265,0.1014,2.8586,0.0011,3.3501,1.6225,5.3325,1.2863,2.5692,0.7574,2.5773,1.1979,2.9312,0.1895,3.2869,4.6029,4.1065,0.5673,4.6169,0.0007,0.0291,3.9593,0.8024,0.0184,0.3278,4.9903,0.3028,3.2795,4.446,0.9067,3.8234,0.4289,6.3003,4.1558,0.0377,2.2572,1.583,0.0052,0.0013,0.0005,1.6334,2.3953,2.3818,2.4457,3.9038,0.7814,0.6209,3.8713,0.0073,3.832,2.4032,5.4912,2.3669,1.0071,1.754,1.1018,0.0001,0.3294,1.9832,4.5079,4.0971,2.5739,1.7244,2.1102,0.1936,6.5807,2.0228,5.4396,1.4155,2.3191,2.4503,5.8104,2.5721,0.1189,0.306,1.9108,1.5925,0.005,2.8069,0.9427,0.936,5.0165,1.8366]}

This is consistent with the use of the name in South India where the name is often used in place of the noun \"Barber\" (as in Madras, Cochin, Coimbatore etc).","token_len":305,"entropy":[10.8637,10.3189,5.0938,3.2555,0.0782,0.012,5.3139,9.488,6.7222,3.0933,5.1262,5.7542,14.1974,7.139,4.5942,0.0933,0.7744,0.8096,4.471,5.209,3.7881,2.8609,8.322,8.6802,7.4207,6.9805,3.8759,2.8755,1.4149,0.3108,6.2892,0.1873,5.1603,1.0763,0.2151,7.0983,0.639,0.0056,4.0974,1.6813,0.111,9.6462,9.6425,9.9573,3.4616,0.3939,0.3549,0.108,5.8845,6.5218,0.1928,2.9346,0.8107,0.3741,5.2641,2.0945,3.3101,0.4654,0.0885,3.6214,3.0066,0.0973,4.0213,0.3615,4.1776,0.1682,3.696,3.7361,0.7372,2.7859,3.1152,1.6565,0.4709,3.1416,2.6988,0.599,1.4435,1.2589,4.2695,0.4999,5.0424,5.6307,0.5244,3.8234,0.001,0.6161,0.0111,3.6346,4.8361,1.9271,1.1389,6.7658,2.8644,0.437,0.2317,0.0044,0.0611,0.1117,4.5769,0.2261,0.0315,3.4154,4.0591,1.4703,4.1108,1.764,0.7751,0.5415,0.0002,2.4462,0.4027,0.0363,0.1926,0.0005,0.2107,0.0037,0.2679,0.0103,0.0018,0.001,0.0023,0.0003,0.0008,0.0002,0.0008,0.0012,0.0018,0.0191,0.0013,0.0006,0.0276,0.1506,0.0144,0.0291,0.0024,0.001,6.1245,3.3846,0.4205,0.0523,3.9794,3.8939,0.4981,1.676,2.2153,1.4198,5.7393,6.2159,5.7195,1.019,2.3351,3.5063,0.3796,2.2925,3.2968,0.0418,6.3639,1.9211,2.2692,3.3396,3.3229,2.1377,0.8395,3.7488,5.0995,2.715,5.2744,2.7815,1.0845,0.4613,3.2004,3.6445,3.8528,3.2332,0.0487,0.0088,0.0109,0.3136,4.0916,2.551,2.1471,0.113,1.3468,0.1657,0.0003,0.0042,0.004,0.8219,4.5726,0.8281,1.2515,0.5476,0.024,0.0012,4.7949,3.6534,5.1851,2.5996,3.4676,0.5357,1.7521,5.7282,0.774,0.0112,5.3466,2.2082,1.0931,4.734,2.3905,0.5078,0.9505,3.2547,0.2623,3.6591,3.6028,0.0522,6.5576,3.1297,0.8653,5.1227,0.4974,5.7165,1.3518,1.6398,3.0981,2.7196,0.3598,0.9631,3.0133,1.0917,0.1132,0.0249,3.8524,1.1726,2.9583,6.0348,3.8901,0.0976,0.0481,1.3858,2.3991,0.2245,0.8385,1.2284,4.5772,1.7845,4.4777,5.368,0.0773,0.015,1.7104,0.5585,0.6324,2.5755,5.7361,0.0917,0.2095,0.0385,0.0066,0.0004,0.9794,0.876,3.0626,1.3172,3.8499,0.0362,0.4769,3.0173,0.0755,0.5385,1.4969,2.3857,6.1387,2.8774,4.4547,1.1298,1.9792,2.1113,3.3546,0.6244,1.9205,2.232,0.0117,0.8797,5.3277,2.7663,2.5054,0.0248,0.8071,2.6764,2.3357,0.8165,5.8019,0.4862,1.7816,3.8638,0.2409,0.6685,2.7779,0.6069,0.0,0.0001,1.7916,1.4809]}

As a result, Humber threw four pitches that averaged over 113 km \/ h ( 166 km \/ h ) and none that averaged over 120 km \/ h ( 179 km\/ h), meaning that he never averaged over 90 miles per hour ( 150 km \/ h) for five pitches.

{"id":3183,"ended":true,"length":279,"gen_text":"As stated by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard, in this video, Rihanna returned to nature as in her video for her previous single, `` Only Girl ( In the World ) ``, and it was one that she would be missing out on if she followed suit with the likes of other divas. In the clip, Rihanna is wearing a black-cotton legging, a red bra and knee-high boots while performing a song called `` Mother of God. `` As you can see in the video below, Rihanna is performing in front of a black backdrop that is completely naked, save for four gold-rimmed sunglasses. The video closes with Rihanna strumming and singing in her trademark falsetto.In this video, Rihanna performed with Madonna, the video's director, for her single, `` Only Girl ( In the World ).`` In another clip posted in June 2011, Rihanna was seen doing a mock dance alongside fellow singer Mary J. Blige, who can be seen on the right side of the video. Other images taken from this video have made their way onto the internet.``While there may be some difference in the way in which the videos were filmed and the performance styles of the performers, what can be said for certain is that there was no attempt on the part of the producers to present the videos as being realistic. While the performance may have been a departure from usual Rihanna fare, she clearly knew what she was doing by pulling off the video's visual aesthetic.","token_len":306,"entropy":[6.7236,2.7117,7.4211,9.0393,1.1982,0.4412,2.059,7.3355,0.6049,5.1703,4.5934,3.7491,0.898,6.2982,0.0018,9.6602,0.2535,10.4198,3.6153,7.0298,1.9749,3.3017,0.1981,5.0495,4.8175,0.5242,1.1413,9.8343,12.4768,0.0686,0.7862,8.1047,1.5882,0.0026,0.3881,5.6103,2.7008,1.8155,2.5741,1.3471,4.0308,3.5884,1.9213,4.1176,2.896,5.3555,0.7982,0.0837,0.6684,0.2603,4.7873,4.1672,0.6443,1.2989,5.1223,0.0039,4.1916,4.3289,0.0341,1.5695,3.3077,1.2042,2.6695,0.19,0.4471,0.0044,1.8317,4.8023,0.5541,3.2987,3.8704,6.0135,1.5132,5.041,3.3087,1.5712,1.3928,3.2607,4.8153,1.0992,4.8738,0.2482,0.0955,1.5862,3.3615,4.7137,1.0608,3.7153,1.4721,0.48,4.9387,3.0817,2.5165,2.4202,0.3773,4.2272,2.2241,0.3113,0.2427,1.3611,0.0614,0.5577,2.2035,0.0356,1.0266,0.0061,1.7701,3.8375,2.2436,2.5147,0.0079,0.3071,3.9365,1.5427,2.8205,1.4024,4.2241,6.3476,1.3384,3.9786,0.0476,6.5559,5.1893,2.7628,3.6354,0.0037,1.2671,1.4018,2.0649,2.1861,5.3313,0.1025,0.9537,0.0018,5.6296,0.6568,0.0015,3.5164,1.1732,2.6904,2.6242,2.8484,1.668,0.0011,0.0,1.0463,7.1608,2.6339,0.6631,0.1575,0.3632,0.0024,3.5209,3.8901,5.6318,1.6924,4.0778,3.2128,4.0143,0.7009,0.6347,3.736,1.4489,2.305,0.5598,0.0988,3.9753,0.0503,0.3009,0.1898,0.0398,0.0005,1.8679,1.0656,2.3664,6.2035,2.0368,4.1355,4.3272,3.0346,3.1375,0.1906,0.312,0.0016,2.0025,0.8742,4.2619,1.148,4.9259,1.9894,5.407,4.1085,1.7029,4.7941,0.1532,0.1127,0.0004,0.0001,1.7477,1.3903,5.5776,0.081,0.1396,3.2309,0.4275,1.1224,2.708,0.0996,0.0995,2.3963,0.5915,5.9799,4.2326,4.4794,0.84,1.9565,0.3333,2.8298,4.4234,0.3148,0.0367,0.6661,0.383,1.7814,2.1571,4.4029,5.6886,3.9032,4.2098,0.3757,1.5944,6.1226,0.5723,0.9785,2.1853,3.4099,0.0037,1.2701,3.1673,1.0173,1.9582,2.1646,1.3934,5.4015,5.1037,1.2857,0.4047,1.8012,0.1877,3.5743,2.2774,0.4788,1.6426,0.721,0.4414,0.0404,0.0614,3.5209,2.3055,1.0447,3.7011,2.4015,0.7744,0.028,0.0031,0.867,3.146,0.4851,4.8466,1.5824,2.8568,0.7423,2.3875,4.4899,0.884,3.8213,1.3092,4.1459,2.8909,1.149,0.3244,2.852,3.8026,0.1236,5.0622,2.9594,0.009,2.0813,0.088,4.1144,4.2114,4.7533,1.1749,0.1134,0.0637,0.12,4.2726,5.3489,0.4965,0.925,4.0382,2.9315,4.3356,4.8713,0.5279]}

{"id":4250,"ended":false,"length":270,"gen_text":"After breaking from Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, Valiente formed her own coven with Grove as High Priest, still following the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca, albeit without the Wiccan laws, which had never been written in anything other than crude black and white. Their group was known simply as Valiente, and their rituals were more elaborate and complex than those of the Gardnerists, both because of the more complete knowledge of magic that Valiente possessed and also because her coven was larger. The most infamous of this coven's actions was the murder of Lillian Gardiner and her wife, and the burning of New England, all to achieve Valiente's ambition of ending witchcraft and witchcraft's influence on society. As for Gardner's original \"Magick with Wings\" the ritual of which it followed is long lost. Nonetheless, Valiente's followers became a potent group in the 19th century with the addition of several other covens who were inspired by Valiente's teachings. As part of their rituals, however, they would often perform a kind of summoning known as the \"Crow\/Sparrow Dance,\" in which they would call and meet a spirit for battle, then proceed to a battle arena and destroy it with their own spells (in this particular case, a pair of birds ). These ceremonies became so popular that they also became public spectacles, and became known as the \"Witch Hunts\" in England.\nPosted by John at 12:16 PM","token_len":307,"entropy":[6.2673,5.1186,12.2425,1.0687,10.0716,9.2652,7.6393,8.0798,1.1566,0.6106,8.4126,3.9642,0.3505,5.7719,1.9019,0.0369,2.7753,0.0002,2.5276,10.6354,5.339,6.1939,0.0427,4.0839,8.0239,4.9849,1.4019,3.0776,0.162,3.0727,4.9948,4.6627,0.0401,0.0458,1.87,5.2901,3.4571,1.0005,5.5973,0.0322,0.0893,8.3156,2.9405,3.0546,3.2427,5.415,0.6498,3.6374,4.0026,5.2076,1.5309,0.0085,5.9219,4.0019,1.1721,0.0952,0.7231,4.3109,4.5927,1.4579,1.8736,4.1162,0.0272,2.5031,0.0325,0.0331,1.1843,1.1749,2.5654,1.8511,0.8186,3.8126,3.2903,1.0383,2.7309,0.2277,1.9464,0.1573,2.2378,1.1268,5.5172,1.5704,5.5535,2.6179,0.6872,0.915,3.1895,5.6616,1.3613,0.4678,2.9038,2.2758,0.5942,0.0065,0.0025,0.8636,1.0124,2.7369,0.1923,3.8966,1.7143,0.0005,1.0714,3.0501,1.9147,2.8463,3.9717,4.588,0.6486,4.2898,1.1885,0.0,0.7979,4.2327,0.3536,0.5873,2.2407,0.0478,5.2668,3.1219,4.9151,1.0698,2.7531,0.9398,6.2372,0.8842,3.8137,0.8273,3.5939,0.1783,6.5655,3.6229,1.9825,4.253,2.3248,3.971,3.279,0.0156,0.0035,0.03,4.877,0.4998,5.4305,2.34,1.877,3.4912,1.4094,1.8573,0.7555,1.7179,0.2776,4.3774,4.1247,1.4918,1.5446,4.1569,4.79,5.1807,1.1548,6.0349,4.5908,1.3173,5.2162,3.7895,3.0015,1.5803,2.6374,7.2594,2.5132,4.5681,0.9031,2.2833,5.9032,0.1422,1.7819,0.0051,0.0019,0.7659,2.8631,3.9942,3.0133,4.8788,4.9819,2.1146,0.9281,4.9837,0.0083,0.1977,4.5355,2.2375,4.6487,0.0224,3.3585,1.8688,1.2874,0.0004,0.0485,3.6741,2.4424,3.2849,0.0759,1.1854,0.0064,0.0011,0.3986,1.5353,0.616,4.3967,4.8131,0.0022,1.4033,2.7168,0.3518,5.34,0.0103,1.3379,3.0115,1.6549,3.1372,2.2555,3.8055,0.0022,5.6671,3.0301,0.0556,1.2164,1.1504,4.4754,2.4966,6.1192,3.3907,1.1134,0.0135,2.506,1.6097,1.5151,0.0217,0.9408,0.362,2.9084,4.3516,5.6551,2.1454,2.1101,4.3952,4.8875,1.3197,2.7468,4.1552,0.0581,5.1047,4.1133,3.2067,2.0587,5.4661,1.3287,1.8309,1.7965,1.213,2.6065,4.5372,3.8179,1.8704,4.0042,0.595,0.3935,2.0387,4.1123,0.0053,4.5685,7.8909,3.9945,4.5918,2.6723,1.8957,0.603,0.2762,1.3907,5.0435,0.8795,6.5714,0.447,0.0004,0.8488,1.2448,3.6191,2.2401,0.2606,1.505,0.485,3.6133,0.5201,1.8712,1.2741,1.475,2.5794,0.6545,1.3068,5.99,0.0034,5.0803,1.2772,2.4159,0.0701,4.0793,0.572]}

{"id":2780,"ended":false,"length":277,"gen_text":"Chronicle of a Death Foretold ( Cr\u00f3nica de una muerte < unk > ) recreates a murder that took place in Sucre, Colombia in 1951. The character named Santiago Nasar is based on the father of one of the murdered men: Manuel Garc\u00eda Casar.\n\nThe story is told with short flashbacks from Nasar's life: the boy, the man, the time he killed, everything he learned about life, and his last breath. Nasar had been growing up with his father, who had been murdered in an act of revenge, and at the age of 14, he had chosen to kill for the glory of the man who killed his father. When Nasar had become a man and had taken a job on a ship looking for a ship to work with, he learned that his new colleagues were going to cut off his hand with a large scalpel. Because of the time and the nature of the murder he had committed, Nasar died soon after the crime, and the ship never found the scalpel, so there is no record of the crime.\n\nNasar's body was interred in the nearby city of Sucre, and in 1997, a small group of volunteers dug up his bones and set a few pieces of jewelry on display in a local museum. From there, a film was made, which was then released in Chile: The Story of Manuel Nasar (C\u00f3mo Muestra < unk >).\n\n(c) by Jos\u00e9 Luis Castillo Garc\u00eda","token_len":314,"entropy":[4.5619,1.6219,1.7217,4.1552,3.8416,3.9912,0.0167,2.8621,14.2434,6.8209,0.1069,1.315,2.556,1.5817,4.0728,0.4056,0.0001,9.5698,8.7796,10.397,5.016,1.6508,11.8973,2.5041,1.0505,1.8179,5.6302,2.8895,1.8205,0.0042,0.5463,12.0466,0.0517,0.8547,1.9093,1.1369,6.4524,0.5239,1.2019,5.9127,4.8646,6.8406,10.1106,1.164,1.7817,3.4888,0.0418,1.1038,4.9944,0.0795,2.3626,0.0137,0.0817,3.7829,1.6669,4.4683,4.3384,4.7112,0.0051,6.4568,3.7829,1.12,1.1699,0.0265,2.362,3.3489,1.4232,0.8196,3.6538,5.893,1.4392,3.658,5.0092,0.0057,0.0686,1.9267,3.7622,2.0977,3.912,3.156,2.8105,3.2862,0.3544,0.4968,3.7226,2.4439,4.1945,1.4254,6.1114,3.1681,3.6542,1.5892,3.7948,1.6114,1.5996,2.2665,4.141,4.9379,0.2696,3.4219,0.0029,4.3362,1.775,5.6252,0.2152,2.3604,1.5301,1.0677,0.8486,1.6243,1.7699,1.2546,3.7384,1.875,3.1138,2.4292,0.0635,1.6947,2.6924,0.7326,5.0749,0.5724,0.6174,0.0051,2.6283,1.1767,0.6799,1.8204,5.5717,0.2728,1.9459,3.9511,0.7678,6.9711,0.3502,1.5246,3.2532,0.4379,2.7291,0.3606,0.0355,0.2977,4.2588,2.0995,0.0014,3.005,3.7232,0.7632,1.7432,2.1319,1.5714,3.617,2.307,1.2114,4.422,0.5534,2.7232,6.4213,0.0461,1.327,3.1527,1.8287,4.3612,5.0175,0.201,0.4617,3.4777,0.6527,1.1187,4.1556,5.5809,1.1412,3.9837,0.0949,5.3853,1.477,0.4645,1.9494,4.2451,0.5044,4.9991,4.3294,0.0042,0.8824,4.8889,0.8989,2.1207,4.3723,2.9479,1.7471,3.9665,0.0085,0.3988,3.0725,3.7104,0.9276,0.4719,0.1465,1.32,0.0008,5.7451,4.4609,0.2292,1.4252,3.7482,1.4906,1.4568,1.9821,4.097,4.6586,2.3692,1.6377,2.5837,0.0033,2.4092,2.005,3.5864,1.0507,0.3507,2.4254,0.1137,1.6235,0.8256,0.5493,0.7942,0.0002,2.7187,0.0919,0.7924,4.1896,0.4703,6.397,0.0007,0.4606,1.3027,4.5712,2.8322,0.0551,1.7212,0.0285,0.5061,1.4254,3.4081,4.9829,0.4865,1.4518,4.1697,2.0412,0.1259,5.5082,2.3915,0.3615,0.7425,3.463,0.6754,5.3574,4.3513,4.453,2.7376,0.1871,3.8074,0.8306,0.7431,1.1684,1.1101,1.7155,0.7214,0.2616,5.5094,1.8895,0.1575,2.1013,3.5813,1.6368,0.2658,1.4236,1.7337,1.1379,3.1579,2.1877,0.987,5.2556,5.5772,2.3413,2.3551,0.0645,2.6762,2.4376,0.004,1.5542,4.155,2.6205,0.1386,4.9102,4.7095,0.166,6.1906,1.5701,0.7839,0.2168,1.2224,0.7407,0.0002,5.1107,2.7771,0.4983,5.9922,5.242,2.11,5.2214,1.1459,4.3407,0.0086]}
{"id":936,"ended":true,"length":280,"gen_text":"Tessa was born on August 28, 1958 in Lille, France. When she was seven years old, she fell in love for the first time with then @ - @ nineteen @ age's daughter, Anne-Marie @ Tessa... who was four at the time -- and she was determined to have a marriage of her own. Tessa and Anne-Marie married on 12 May, 1962 but she quickly became pregnant. Anne-Marie was nine at the time so Tessa decided she wasn't going to leave, and the couple continued to have regular sex. However, it became increasingly difficult for the new wife to have children so Tessa considered undergoing a hysterectomy. However, she refused because Anne-Marie was afraid she would go insane with regret. A few days later, on 14 May, 1963, Anne-Marie suffered a stroke and while Tessa was giving Anne-Marie some assistance in her home, Anne-Marie suddenly opened the window and fell and died. Tessa had left Anne-Marie's body at her parents' home. It was then that some of the other family members noticed that Tessa was missing and when they went to find her she was gone.

Today the army strength stands at 18 combat, four reserve, four combat support and eight logistic brigades.The government has allocated Rs 100 crore to expand the army by 12 lakh troops and Rs 50 crore for bolstering the logistics and training sector of the forces after coming to power.The Ministry of Defence in its latest report on defence forces has said that the government has placed emphasis on strengthening the military forces to provide better capability to deal with new threats, which will require military force to be better utilised.It noted that the military is likely to face a challenge of the increased number of terror attacks going on around the world. As a result more troops can be brought in to tackle Indian-origin terrorists with the possible aid of counter-terrorism forces in the neighbouring countries.The report said the Army strength stood at 19,542 at end-June 2014, which has seen a steady rise with the recent inductions in the operational theatre. India is also upgrading the strength of the Air Force from its current strength of 1,130 to 1,178 and the Navy from 949 to 1,069 vessels.The report said the Army has been steadily growing over the years, with the latest inductions adding more than 60% to the operational strength in the last 3 years.

{"id":3860,"ended":true,"length":288,"gen_text":"The wood thrush has been reported to have one of the most beautiful songs of North American birds. American naturalist Henry David Thoreau wrote : Whenever a man hears it he is young, and never far from home in the woods ; it is so lovely that he has to leave his house and walk half the village streets in an hour to enjoy it, and to return home again he is tired, and the night is chilly and windy. Another bird song of similar appeal is heard and appreciated by children.\n\nIt is a very high-pitched note, unlike that of birds of prey such as the eagles or the crows, and with the added advantage that it can be heard from great distances. The wood thrush can also be heard over long distances by those who are listening through an ear or two cut off from the tree.\n\nWhat can be done to help our natural heritage survive?\n\nThere is a large amount of support required to deal with the impacts of development on endangered species. It can never be completely removed but we can encourage local authorities to make sure some of the key wildlife conservation areas in their areas remain protected.\n\nWe should be investing in conservation for species like the wood thrush to preserve their habitats so that they can continue to thrive.\n\nThese beautiful birds are an important part of everyday life, making their lives as pleasant as possible, and so important to us.\n\nWood thrush breeding season is in late June and July.

This means that the other team must keep time onside, i.e. change position and pass or receive.\n\nTeams are not allowed to change positions during a possession.\n\nThe most common offence is a tackle where the player is tackled by an opponent who is also playing the tackle.\n\nOffensive players can either do a \" free kick \" where the ball is sent directly at the opponent's goal or a \" take on \" where the player running into the opposition can then be tackled.","token_len":319,"entropy":[10.9578,1.9221,2.8995,8.3446,1.8662,3.8993,1.0275,6.5588,1.5735,6.7354,2.3994,2.9612,1.2992,1.5813,0.733,0.002,0.0319,0.735,6.0107,6.04,4.8429,0.5871,3.5033,3.097,6.237,0.7636,2.9939,5.2555,11.6219,7.356,0.8438,0.0234,0.233,0.9227,5.1627,6.4243,4.5585,0.5405,0.8089,3.4901,1.2068,4.522,0.506,0.0203,1.5008,1.9979,1.0164,0.4883,1.7692,0.0984,1.9018,2.8415,2.6562,0.3673,0.1476,0.0063,0.0051,0.1055,5.3289,0.0413,1.2076,3.5501,3.345,3.4947,1.0009,1.7652,0.0149,5.0744,0.857,0.5942,1.5159,2.1986,1.0702,0.0089,2.3013,0.7852,3.9471,0.7065,0.3751,3.1146,1.3899,5.1853,3.9398,1.2056,7.1946,0.6852,0.7825,6.1912,0.0906,0.5952,1.8357,0.0002,1.9168,4.8838,1.0025,0.9638,5.6299,1.9689,3.7537,0.3295,0.1673,3.2024,3.1432,3.5935,0.1976,2.1065,0.6617,5.2762,0.8283,0.432,4.1968,1.7192,1.4413,5.071,0.1901,1.8301,4.5941,3.8536,2.3727,3.2195,5.5736,0.8059,3.28,0.3872,0.1777,0.0218,0.0503,5.0669,3.7003,4.0295,2.4589,5.6503,6.305,2.7055,2.1829,5.1527,4.2697,3.1486,1.4596,4.3952,0.4815,0.027,2.3119,0.2109,0.5456,0.4231,5.2781,5.1247,1.3646,0.2053,7.3792,1.968,2.4086,0.2539,0.9625,0.7677,0.0002,2.934,6.0511,5.8265,0.7593,1.4438,0.7355,3.8255,2.1001,2.6158,2.1165,4.2975,4.8005,0.0785,0.3068,5.8268,3.1531,2.2751,5.0271,0.0019,0.0018,0.4278,3.9919,1.3739,3.5365,0.5405,1.1187,4.5903,6.1695,6.311,1.4016,0.42,0.8641,1.2167,2.7201,0.378,5.5181,3.5765,1.2363,2.5707,0.1479,0.0629,3.1999,5.5686,2.3066,0.0878,4.7323,1.8748,0.3719,0.0255,0.3368,3.2089,0.6468,2.8128,0.0035,0.8093,4.6749,5.6348,0.5269,3.4978,2.8272,0.4217,2.2618,5.3221,0.1211,1.985,4.3359,5.977,1.7585,6.382,2.4701,1.2998,0.0012,0.0008,0.0748,4.4487,1.7543,2.7185,2.4585,1.502,4.3129,2.9849,0.5947,0.0002,5.2105,0.01,1.7144,2.302,0.1486,0.0409,2.6394,1.3667,1.7142,1.1007,3.8471,1.1991,1.4893,0.0002,1.6602,4.8634,0.5624,4.1749,0.7899,1.8048,3.4911,4.3218,0.939,1.469,2.336,1.2734,1.4099,1.3144,0.2528,2.3904,0.7394,2.9118,4.2846,0.6448,1.2935,0.5353,1.3868,0.0002,3.8376,1.0411,0.6344,1.7692,5.1353,5.7141,0.3264,3.3466,8.6405,0.5817,0.1606,2.9496,0.8513,0.5686,0.2567,5.5576,3.1075,2.7558,0.437,1.5415,0.8803,0.316,1.3626,1.3682,0.2031,5.0977,1.2976,0.0933,0.2364,0.2305,2.3068,5.7136,2.9893,0.2144,2.7244,4.8206,3.6371,2.3094,0.0745,0.7532]}

The advertisement saw football star David Beckham and his team of star team-mates in an on-field training session where he displayed a large bottle of NoitulovE. The bottle was being used by one of the players as a warm up drink.The advertising campaign was spearheaded by TV PR man Richard Koo who, with a team of representatives from the 'UK', made sure the advert was properly placed in more than 80 UK channels including Sky and Channel4. It remained in rotation across several seasons.NoitulovE, created and manufactured by the British branch of German pharmaceutical giant Bayer, was created as a drink to stimulate the nervous system.Its official name is 'Tilax' and contains a mixture of caffeine, and magnesium salts. It is not known where NoitulovE originated, but it is often used to help athletes during a strenuous sport, such as soccer.It has been credited with the introduction of the 'kettlebell' into the training kit of 'powerlifters' in 1996, and has had huge influence on the physical development of many athletes over the past two decades.","token_len":319,"entropy":[4.9668,1.1543,0.4521,2.0544,6.8963,0.0228,6.2949,5.5024,8.1153,0.7743,9.5197,0.1715,8.4215,11.2193,6.3156,5.8438,11.4097,3.036,4.1669,0.0433,4.7189,2.4495,4.7485,7.3205,0.1012,0.2862,7.2268,0.6742,11.7774,6.2405,1.3656,1.4396,4.8353,3.0279,7.0269,10.7566,5.7264,4.0225,3.5843,0.4297,1.1392,6.3125,4.9963,3.9664,2.8304,2.9437,0.011,0.5941,3.9206,4.0786,0.5583,5.4451,0.8374,2.3541,4.6573,3.9607,0.9745,0.9397,2.3622,0.4987,3.2842,0.4621,0.401,0.7304,0.8662,3.9812,3.3781,1.2921,5.1621,0.7869,1.2902,3.5636,2.2143,5.6982,1.7352,0.0073,0.0681,0.0069,0.0431,0.3713,3.9879,0.9437,0.0061,0.9179,1.2844,4.8522,4.6308,0.4948,0.7393,0.6731,1.301,2.3551,4.9067,5.6871,6.5517,2.7241,1.7672,0.0338,2.7601,1.518,2.0705,1.4334,4.562,7.0625,0.2444,0.0776,3.4178,3.1242,4.7213,0.1068,0.6711,2.5805,0.3688,5.2971,3.8794,5.4677,1.9327,5.8193,4.5946,0.0894,2.5695,0.1882,0.025,0.0043,0.1592,1.6246,1.5799,0.9797,0.7666,5.3898,1.3055,1.8625,3.5447,0.0483,0.3639,0.9293,1.1306,0.3849,4.722,1.9008,0.4018,1.5119,1.8634,5.0878,0.6597,0.9675,5.299,0.0228,5.1726,5.4148,2.6312,4.0823,4.8515,5.4686,3.0723,2.7033,2.5365,2.8749,0.5651,0.0801,5.3146,0.9265,1.7618,1.6859,0.1646,1.2765,4.7106,2.4807,1.1716,1.9748,0.6589,4.7421,3.7323,0.7236,5.6169,0.0237,4.3003,3.8292,5.2827,3.7772,1.5228,2.5781,2.3865,4.3519,0.4588,2.9927,6.4691,0.9827,2.8176,3.9395,4.8984,6.0129,2.4164,2.9526,0.0364,0.0083,0.002,0.0169,2.7773,4.325,3.7941,1.4222,0.488,1.5885,3.7616,4.6874,0.0064,4.6566,2.6273,1.6279,1.9971,0.5925,1.0619,3.655,2.0234,0.2692,4.6685,1.0833,4.7734,0.9425,4.6516,0.0184,1.5265,5.9205,5.0881,1.3733,0.3662,1.2648,4.6968,4.2725,4.1983,1.3009,0.61,4.436,1.9523,2.0005,0.0065,3.7968,0.7197,5.8106,5.6719,2.5742,0.665,1.7479,0.8055,4.146,2.3187,4.455,2.6201,0.011,0.0037,0.0019,0.0062,2.2807,1.3198,0.5892,0.8262,0.5601,4.5323,2.2322,2.4705,2.053,2.6714,4.2587,3.4948,3.6492,0.0038,4.155,2.3577,1.3869,0.0031,3.8114,1.0692,2.3664,2.2455,0.9351,4.5047,0.2445,3.2048,5.1459,0.0363,1.0122,1.7563,5.373,1.6695,0.7543,0.5778,2.6634,0.7286,3.8531,4.204,0.1976,6.0873,3.7876,1.1378,0.0009,0.786,2.2934,5.2644,1.1,1.3859,1.7654,5.1346,6.7241,3.568,0.3578,0.6052,5.3792,1.9511,0.0474,1.5195,1.6095,3.2095,0.0746,1.4392,1.9839,0.0313,0.141]}

Up to 65 species of fruit have been collected over the last 100 years. The fruit of the Guianan species, like many other tropical fruits, has been traditionally chewed and eaten raw.\n- The male cock is not a sexually mature bird until he is 2-3 days old. Males are called 'guitars' and mate during the early summer months, and the female is called 'dukes'. The chicks hatch between 6 and 9 days after hatching. As we eat our meals inside, it makes more sense to eat raw meat; we would need to clean it later since meat is highly smelly. A cooked cock is an easy meal, because we can cut off a large section and consume small quantities.\n- These birds live for anywhere between 12 and 18 years.

The Persian emperor then allowed Valerian to live for several months until Shapur demanded the Persian prince turn his attention eastwards and attack the Roman province of Armenia.\n\n Shapur's troops moved eastward through Syria towards the Persian heartlands, where he hoped to attack the Roman province of Armenia. As soon as the Persian troops reached Asia Minor, they were met by Roman troops under the supreme commander of the Roman military expedition in the Middle East, Marcus Flavius Verus (266-265). The Roman commander of the Eastern Roman Empire, Flavius Valerius Maximus (270-272), also fought against Shapur's armies, but later on took part in the battle at Issus in the west and defeated Shapur's army at the Battle of Mokrymes (the City of the Annihilators) in the west, where there were a number of huge casualties. Shapur himself died some time later at the hands of Maximus. Around the time when he died, Shapur had assumed the Persian throne in a coup, with his brother B\u0101b\u0101d\u012b (285-284) succeeding him as the new Persian ruler. Shapur's son Ab\u016b Sh\u0101hid (285-280) continued the family dynasty, but his rule was far from successful, and he had to settle for the life of the wealthy prince Yazdegerd II, following his father as successor.","token_len":320,"entropy":[6.3494,0.4401,15.1467,4.317,0.3459,7.6449,8.082,1.5228,1.5998,9.1435,3.23,4.841,0.3247,0.0551,5.9709,1.733,1.3136,2.2764,4.8074,4.9573,0.9948,1.0055,4.0749,5.6648,0.0064,1.5902,6.1395,6.6998,5.4632,3.517,5.1583,4.3359,0.8541,0.163,1.0373,3.7301,2.4848,2.8795,3.1858,5.5163,2.5868,0.0014,0.0003,0.194,2.9137,3.4852,3.2585,0.978,3.1627,0.509,0.0001,4.3986,2.298,5.6606,3.7939,7.1796,3.7388,2.1338,4.2294,2.0224,2.0666,2.7634,0.8434,0.7509,1.6225,0.0632,2.7495,0.346,5.0249,21.1205,0.0002,1.4012,4.2532,3.767,1.9402,1.9988,3.3675,3.8562,3.5454,0.9761,3.2827,3.0412,1.7815,1.8584,2.3086,2.1678,3.372,0.1154,3.7527,0.7093,0.7031,0.4693,0.0381,0.9302,0.474,4.3317,3.4218,0.0065,1.7608,1.1778,2.7564,1.5124,6.7029,0.0489,0.3402,1.4734,1.2315,1.6389,0.165,2.8652,1.866,1.8295,0.9339,6.5211,0.3556,1.1662,0.0954,0.4782,4.2702,4.0309,2.9768,1.6132,4.6078,0.0114,0.1565,2.9415,5.116,0.0284,2.9025,0.0104,2.0654,5.3492,0.4318,3.8243,0.225,1.817,1.3061,1.4535,4.3328,0.1875,4.2114,1.8446,1.3352,0.7092,2.909,0.0096,1.4322,0.0654,1.1912,1.8606,0.0039,0.6466,3.3907,0.0717,2.2306,0.3646,3.7564,3.823,1.17,0.4854,0.0002,1.5601,2.1713,2.0952,1.1122,5.5277,4.4511,5.795,1.2683,0.0167,0.6777,2.3373,2.2787,2.4894,0.0057,1.9694,2.1801,3.5722,2.1606,4.3503,0.9034,0.0003,0.6477,0.9834,1.6302,1.4591,0.8847,0.0034,4.5313,4.9229,5.2631,2.7012,1.3318,5.406,5.9293,0.0595,1.6926,5.5881,1.7881,0.2779,0.603,0.4034,0.1256,3.515,2.7492,1.823,5.6322,0.7352,4.0102,1.1984,0.0045,6.3503,3.0081,0.9796,1.6597,0.0002,2.6691,2.2044,6.2972,0.6726,0.9424,2.0908,1.0836,2.3596,0.0024,3.312,0.0046,0.7658,7.0089,1.615,2.3208,4.3031,4.0914,0.7762,0.1622,0.5603,0.0001,1.1801,5.5877,0.3737,4.1071,1.1415,3.0738,2.5537,1.5289,2.5096,3.5941,0.9684,1.6449,3.2913,3.2266,0.1615,1.3106,0.5764,2.3548,2.437,5.1341,0.1264,3.3179,0.6494,3.8094,0.126,1.1345,1.4372,0.9001,1.1196,2.3577,0.1563,3.2231,0.0003,0.4198,1.762,4.1284,0.1271,3.8356,0.8049,6.3833,0.7435,0.759,0.0379,4.2318,0.221,3.9786,0.8786,2.1382,1.7287,1.4852,1.4317,2.1188,2.3184,0.3771,4.4088,0.41,3.3767,1.5554,0.829,0.9687,4.0888,0.3435,4.8688,0.1367,2.3096,5.4344,0.0341,5.077,5.2227,3.9183,6.7121,0.8339,0.0025,0.0025,0.8072,1.8834,6.5868,1.4353,0.6644,5.5514,4.5382,0.4535]}

After learning about some of the other contestants' past, including Rhys's family history with Mary, and the fact that Rhys had some sort of a relationship with one of the teachers in Rhys's class at school, the pair are forced to confront one of the defining issues of their lives - their long-standing dislike for each other.\n\nThe song 'Walking The Cow' was by T Bone Burnett.\n\nThis is the first episode of Series 7 in which the series' main title is sung.","token_len":321,"entropy":[8.3721,5.5762,3.0825,5.3558,1.4272,7.0646,1.8736,0.1312,4.322,6.7588,3.716,2.4024,7.4605,0.6923,10.9125,2.8392,1.061,0.4284,0.6298,0.6593,7.6372,7.7597,2.4247,6.8268,5.8283,2.2896,5.6036,0.3494,2.0933,0.0084,0.7233,0.5183,10.2681,2.1409,0.1754,3.6712,8.7112,1.9048,4.3553,5.1545,2.2053,0.1422,0.2547,5.0315,5.1538,2.8707,1.2485,6.0665,2.2666,5.24,3.1343,0.0296,0.0016,0.0739,0.7166,0.0011,1.3341,3.2235,5.3026,0.4128,0.9734,0.3482,0.7944,0.0028,9.4093,7.4814,0.0207,0.9488,0.0273,0.0009,0.1784,0.0096,0.0011,10.4076,0.002,4.1778,1.675,0.0184,0.0016,0.0024,0.0022,0.0009,0.0014,0.0994,0.0004,0.0008,0.1481,0.0021,0.0076,0.0005,0.0004,0.0001,0.0003,3.0729,0.0072,3.7872,1.4392,0.6343,5.7,1.2248,4.6131,0.0845,3.9646,0.4397,0.7639,1.38,3.032,1.6969,0.0011,1.031,0.2626,0.0002,2.0981,0.7771,3.1125,3.3147,3.8735,1.6113,0.0069,5.5674,0.4593,4.3701,0.7795,1.4232,3.773,1.5972,4.8717,1.3804,1.3287,4.1675,1.0406,0.4222,0.6342,0.6652,3.0862,1.6021,0.0027,1.6364,2.3053,2.3216,5.635,1.0255,0.6311,1.5127,4.1707,1.551,4.8841,0.3915,2.3949,4.6955,2.4995,4.596,1.8955,2.854,4.1734,7.0568,0.344,3.1893,0.1371,0.3451,1.3869,2.0383,2.5033,5.0627,1.6858,0.0367,0.4083,3.7696,1.5177,0.2719,0.3675,2.1415,1.7903,4.6727,5.0373,1.2493,4.5533,0.0417,2.0144,0.0015,1.2298,2.8651,4.7055,4.7875,0.333,0.206,1.0496,3.5065,1.3663,2.8814,1.4371,1.7846,2.5793,1.3155,0.0041,1.9416,0.1821,0.0008,2.8343,2.7731,1.2374,0.0327,4.8467,0.014,0.0017,3.3291,4.7924,4.3473,0.3752,1.5904,0.2866,0.7688,0.465,0.0025,0.235,4.5345,5.3485,2.4238,6.797,0.6709,0.8246,3.751,5.4517,1.5045,0.9882,1.8928,4.2452,2.7747,0.002,1.1335,4.5147,1.807,2.474,1.8698,0.6194,3.8775,2.012,1.489,0.1653,1.5533,0.0011,3.7984,5.742,2.3978,0.0049,3.3166,1.9779,0.0212,3.8162,0.036,0.6247,4.0342,2.5762,5.7882,0.0087,0.0668,1.4963,2.7782,0.6357,0.1147,1.8095,1.2128,2.5838,1.1,0.0568,1.8214,4.1096,1.2086,0.8551,5.1378,2.2507,0.463,0.4933,1.6929,2.7288,1.5919,4.9583,0.2637,0.917,3.8111,0.8796,1.0857,0.0047,0.0872,0.5272,0.0003,1.7433,6.0977,1.9483,4.2344,1.8644,4.0543,1.5147,0.3214,1.1971,3.4128,5.726,4.8701,0.0027,1.3133,0.602,0.0003,2.7876,1.2518,0.132,0.7472,0.6899,0.9415,1.5507,2.397,2.736,0.0313,1.4078,2.9823,2.5079,3.0873,1.2866,1.9789,2.3765,0.8275]}

{"id":3072,"ended":true,"length":301,"gen_text":"Wood began her career appearing in several made @ - @ for @ - @ television films from 1994 onward, also playing an occasional role in the television series American Gothic. In 1996, she landed one of her most popular roles as Karen on the short-lived soap opera General Hospital. In 2003, she starred in the film version of the '90s soap opera Beverly Hills High as the mother of Holly O'Donnell.\nWith such varied dramatic experiences, it is not surprising that Wood received a multi-episode guest role on the hit TV series LOST alongside J. Boone Pickens.\nWood was cast as the lead female role of Lucy on the show in season four and the role lasted until season nine. In addition to her numerous television work, Wood has worked extensively on stage: She played Rachel on the off-Broadway musical, \"What's Love Got to Do with It,\" which won Best Musical Revival at the 2003 Tony Awards, and the role of Sally and Mary on the 2007 tour. Wood, however, has never appeared on the hit show Modern Family, so some of the roles she has had in the hit show have not been credited to her.\nWood was born and spent some of her childhood in the Chicago area, where she met her future husband.

{"id":523,"ended":true,"length":290,"gen_text":"Although the poem was defended by a few critics, E. C. Pettet returned to the argument that the poem lacked a structure and emphasized the word `` forlorn `` as evidence of his view that the poem lacked a narrative structure. The poem was ultimately accepted, although there was concern because of the frequent usage of the word `` forlorn '' in the poem that suggested the word play was part of the poem's overall design.\n\nThe poem was written in response to his first and only divorce during the early 1940s, and the main plot of the poem concerns a man's disillusionment with love and the meaning of life after being divorced by his first wife (who was also his mother). After their divorce, Mr. and Mrs. Pintard returned to a successful relationship. However, in his second divorce, Mrs. Pintard found fault with the fact that Mr. Pintard had left her with little money and no assets. The poem details the Pintards and the Pintard children's descent into poverty, and the poem concludes with the line \"And yet he remained his whole life\".\n\nThe poem was published in 1954. Later in 1954, the poem was used as the theme of a play, based on the poem, by Edwin Black. In the play, the Pintards' former pastor, Mr. Pinto, believes that God will change the way the Pintards do business. At the conclusion of the play, the author of the song, Richard Russell Pintard, is seen in tears while contemplating his former position with the church.","token_len":323,"entropy":[1.4581,9.8441,1.8634,10.6513,0.6133,3.445,4.5081,4.0702,0.7168,7.7852,1.0931,4.8389,0.0228,10.6248,5.6069,6.8204,0.5188,1.2181,6.9302,0.8173,1.165,1.3755,5.386,2.1684,6.4508,1.6002,6.6338,0.9,5.6003,9.0589,11.7094,4.5632,0.0132,3.9771,2.3229,3.4534,0.7648,3.5121,3.5169,0.4498,0.6613,0.5933,1.9783,0.7109,3.5242,1.9588,0.1743,2.6645,2.5399,1.2458,5.1068,2.4636,2.3067,2.762,3.8685,1.0739,5.3574,7.0486,0.9343,0.5338,5.863,5.1233,0.0127,0.8616,0.4,0.0887,0.5856,0.003,0.0001,2.8332,0.8871,0.2206,0.4526,4.8943,4.1205,1.9374,4.0327,6.0662,1.0051,4.3784,0.0052,0.4269,0.8517,0.4065,4.2773,3.9596,0.2142,0.9453,0.0036,1.845,2.2856,0.9798,3.6603,0.8137,2.9451,0.0066,4.6174,4.4794,4.6878,0.4151,3.9615,6.2978,0.9948,2.9314,3.2129,0.3337,1.7051,1.5126,1.7877,5.6092,4.8796,1.4303,0.0435,0.0788,2.3095,1.786,1.6569,1.6022,5.8254,0.0376,0.5845,3.7953,1.0915,1.5533,3.6875,0.1396,0.5283,2.4904,4.0991,1.2622,2.3592,0.3138,2.3985,0.0775,3.8796,2.1105,2.2466,2.3839,0.8332,2.2083,1.2585,4.0123,5.3826,0.4273,0.1999,4.6644,0.0071,1.8343,0.0083,0.003,4.9994,4.3199,0.3707,4.0629,0.0953,3.4006,5.0622,3.3888,2.1097,1.9867,0.0191,3.1446,3.5925,2.3427,1.6494,0.5369,1.4928,0.0035,0.0158,0.0017,0.0051,4.4591,5.8023,0.167,1.0302,2.4958,0.0391,0.9825,0.0017,0.0709,0.0026,0.0014,1.2277,3.4351,1.1503,3.5462,4.7642,0.9899,1.1062,1.8683,2.4578,1.072,2.7123,1.5313,5.6749,0.9575,2.5375,0.004,0.5715,5.9766,2.1001,3.0876,0.0255,0.5951,1.1108,0.4549,5.3556,0.0667,0.3907,1.7644,1.6733,1.3086,1.8776,2.1196,0.1765,0.5427,2.8818,2.999,2.7081,4.4568,3.7367,5.0878,5.8231,4.9372,0.1832,3.433,0.7546,0.0002,1.3808,0.9822,0.7452,1.8222,0.3225,4.6897,2.5195,5.9745,1.931,1.1462,0.1818,1.3934,1.0596,0.2074,3.5718,1.2259,0.6719,2.2962,2.0484,0.7175,3.3118,1.4985,5.6048,0.1301,0.4536,1.0425,0.6237,2.4964,5.9191,5.0967,1.1947,2.1386,1.7545,0.4416,0.0725,0.9797,1.5038,0.0028,0.239,2.4255,5.3729,5.3003,1.0041,1.807,0.0031,1.9605,4.8068,0.1203,5.6161,0.6166,3.4769,2.342,4.5497,0.845,4.9694,1.1956,0.3037,0.0046,0.1044,5.509,1.0321,1.6686,4.1667,0.256,3.114,0.0265,0.0188,0.0287,0.0458,1.225,5.6381,0.988,0.0454,4.9521,1.2062,5.3082,5.1147,3.3746,0.0883,0.004,0.1181,1.9869,2.4805,2.73,4.0791,3.4213,5.3359,1.3205,3.1642,5.4636,2.7861,0.6061,2.507,0.5051]}

He also wrote and performed several stage comedies.\n\nStamper had been involved with some of the key elements of popular music throughout his life, not least with the Strandville-based Ziegfeld Flour Mill, which began operations in the 1920s.\n\nHis son Paul, a Toronto based pianist, recorded the soundtrack to the CBC television series \" The Strictly Come Dancing \" in 2007.\n\nAfter decades of composing music, the late Peter Tchaikovsky, considered the progenitor of the Modern Russian repertoire, was a longtime admirer as well.","token_len":324,"entropy":[4.911,5.3911,2.9095,6.741,5.713,4.7219,13.2032,0.0072,2.2863,5.0336,0.0073,0.9604,5.1744,0.1638,0.1631,11.9344,0.6823,4.5278,9.4874,7.6777,6.1792,4.0353,3.2399,6.6789,2.7366,0.1342,0.5462,4.5633,3.3676,9.6764,3.0864,3.9335,5.6435,5.7357,7.6201,12.0672,7.8481,1.6945,2.4266,0.4937,3.5414,0.1932,0.366,3.9903,4.7316,0.5093,0.3744,0.0854,3.4421,0.6773,0.1063,0.8104,3.6966,6.0729,5.7228,3.0885,1.3693,5.6428,0.0165,0.0555,5.4095,5.0228,3.3075,1.2837,3.0768,1.5654,5.7411,0.3004,0.0055,5.9848,2.615,5.1137,4.1941,1.0787,5.132,0.0258,0.0099,6.521,0.6019,0.3925,2.0413,2.5858,1.192,3.4511,2.4753,0.6847,0.7544,6.1786,3.5265,0.9355,0.9694,1.8477,2.5464,4.4035,3.644,2.8505,2.3581,5.2548,9.4585,6.1382,0.1821,1.5807,0.0006,0.0561,1.8665,3.3123,2.8256,2.9818,0.8602,3.0628,2.615,1.6518,1.4532,0.9609,6.316,0.051,0.0006,2.8221,5.5896,0.0424,0.687,1.2169,1.1937,0.0285,2.917,1.3575,2.3291,5.5895,0.7095,4.3089,0.215,0.715,2.8643,4.3932,0.9535,2.512,2.2688,3.3955,2.8291,1.2586,0.0002,5.9023,3.3723,1.6249,0.093,1.1683,4.6411,4.1056,0.9119,0.1064,0.0002,6.1943,0.6331,1.2538,4.9936,1.5604,2.5796,0.3683,1.5941,1.416,1.6981,4.2828,5.0931,3.4844,1.9511,5.2347,0.5252,1.0101,2.7959,0.4519,3.7178,0.4805,5.0596,0.6658,1.1783,0.8385,0.0058,4.6657,0.8553,1.4762,0.0007,3.913,1.3875,5.6497,1.2854,0.114,3.0146,2.7695,0.7479,2.8127,2.1565,3.2753,3.9007,3.932,2.5146,3.3576,0.5375,0.2547,1.6668,5.3781,0.5847,1.2784,0.9183,1.1257,3.0784,2.63,1.0401,3.1778,4.8999,6.0252,0.0,1.7446,0.6781,0.0002,2.169,0.0039,0.0026,3.6417,1.7486,4.3802,0.9054,5.6533,0.9396,0.5859,5.7546,4.4094,0.4347,5.0582,0.4502,4.0754,0.1939,0.8058,1.0835,5.9019,1.0794,2.4455,1.269,3.8962,0.0149,0.0062,1.2994,0.0186,0.3648,0.0144,0.0054,0.1443,0.0004,0.0315,1.2034,0.8794,4.7184,3.2624,0.0965,2.3147,1.7645,0.0303,0.6937,2.1476,0.0002,2.3757,3.7057,4.6174,1.7268,1.486,3.3076,5.4495,3.9588,0.0012,0.4902,5.3832,2.7518,4.2112,1.0964,0.8043,5.0972,1.4627,0.7652,5.475,7.1311,5.1733,3.4951,0.0764,0.2773,0.003,0.4583,1.2539,3.0246,0.307,0.6303,0.0002,5.185,4.1743,0.4402,3.6725,1.6128,0.5479,4.2289,3.3652,4.1861,4.1175,0.9978,0.0004,0.024,2.0236,4.7371,1.6515,6.3297,0.0045,0.0031,0.0225,1.3627,6.1369,3.0753,3.1619,0.1027,2.0313,2.0136,3.9265,2.1439,0.0001,6.9787,0.4087,0.2569]}

In 2008, copper represented over 90 % of the battery manufacturing world, making up about 80 % of the batteries.\n\nNickel, the third most common element in the battery universe supplies about 10% of the electricity, making up about 12 % of the batteries.\n\nLead, the fourth most common element in the battery world, supplies about 5 % of the electricity, making up only about 2 % of the batteries.\n\nSilver, the fifth most common element in the battery world, supplies 6 % of the electricity, making up only about 1,5 % of the batteries.","token_len":326,"entropy":[5.7797,0.2109,9.797,7.2665,0.0779,10.7186,4.2036,0.0012,2.4725,1.8809,0.5247,4.8777,1.3166,8.2414,0.7412,2.5888,0.0242,2.4451,14.016,8.6767,13.2434,3.4955,0.0004,0.0032,0.6359,0.9467,4.3266,2.064,0.7517,0.2687,0.0308,0.0002,0.0008,4.2043,2.2065,1.7641,5.0699,4.4214,7.2909,0.1335,2.7486,2.4238,2.076,3.9619,0.0913,1.5176,4.8785,5.204,2.3665,0.0154,5.302,4.7188,1.6482,1.7993,0.1933,2.6125,1.1173,1.97,1.2396,1.7978,5.2634,1.5908,0.1247,0.7798,2.7615,4.6346,0.1803,3.1418,0.0003,0.0002,1.2576,1.9334,3.3885,1.4477,2.0501,1.9566,2.1894,0.0084,0.8269,3.6703,5.6179,0.0058,0.0029,0.0,0.5578,1.7965,1.9004,4.256,0.1342,1.5713,0.0003,0.0005,5.6347,2.81,0.7151,2.7561,0.3124,0.0011,0.0013,0.0001,4.9525,3.2756,2.5444,1.4918,2.2794,2.7505,2.7832,0.1164,1.0016,0.0123,6.3125,0.8661,4.899,0.1695,7.9311,1.3165,0.0005,0.0004,0.6644,1.5435,2.268,1.5718,2.4983,0.5946,1.3343,0.0066,4.4571,0.0297,3.0219,2.9515,1.5972,0.0982,1.74,1.082,0.5468,2.5067,0.7924,0.0126,2.6152,5.9651,0.1781,5.5599,2.3049,3.6579,5.683,1.3585,4.6701,0.9484,0.578,2.7349,2.7057,0.3666,4.5115,3.0135,2.3167,0.0715,6.3548,6.6707,1.0452,0.0304,2.3973,2.5813,0.0036,3.5418,2.9424,2.4951,0.789,2.6977,0.5973,0.2867,3.9752,0.5752,2.2939,0.675,1.9448,5.7226,4.1624,0.3182,0.9061,2.0449,0.6507,2.8487,2.9234,1.2101,0.18,0.0171,3.483,0.1131,4.4081,3.5035,3.6029,3.2605,2.0866,2.2766,2.4123,1.2073,4.7836,0.7253,3.0289,1.204,1.597,0.8607,4.2803,0.6738,1.4161,1.5165,2.3928,1.8066,0.0589,0.8909,2.0215,3.3386,2.8151,0.0844,0.0099,0.4517,4.6139,3.9096,2.8759,2.0059,2.647,2.162,2.7908,3.1122,0.0895,0.0128,0.4931,5.0632,4.3737,0.8792,0.0002,3.7239,0.0006,1.5655,0.7757,0.2594,0.0976,0.2665,0.7467,0.3551,0.3205,1.4728,1.7005,8.4106,1.5652,2.1453,2.2478,0.0336,0.2298,4.0125,3.15,1.7825,0.2792,0.5027,4.0361,0.9949,0.0275,0.1971,0.7762,0.3666,2.8688,0.0002,1.6019,0.5063,0.2429,0.1856,0.0533,0.0539,0.0978,0.2172,0.0355,0.259,1.7174,0.5568,1.2509,0.567,1.9968,2.029,0.0231,0.0593,0.3773,0.2602,0.0927,0.0044,5.5585,0.8237,1.315,0.3707,0.0053,0.0433,0.0263,0.0402,0.2766,0.0002,3.2557,0.3877,0.1552,0.1458,0.0189,0.0179,0.0446,0.0852,0.0069,0.062,0.4837,0.221,0.3975,6.6917,0.605,0.0078,0.0092,0.097,0.0699,0.0439,0.0121,0.9791,0.1928,0.8839,4.9775,0.723,0.0859,0.0031,0.0129,0.0067,0.0162]}

{"id":3384,"ended":false,"length":312,"gen_text":"The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Jakob Dorof of Slant Magazine wrote that `` Hands All Over `` is `` the one real gamble `` ; despite the fact that it has never been performed in its entirety. The song was featured in the opening sequence to the film, `` The Silence of the Lambs''.\n\nHollywood-era R&B singer\/songwriter Johnny Cash once commented on the song's originality: `` [t]he [original song] is just about the only song on the record he's still got enough of that he'll sing it. He sings it all the time. The lyric `hands all over' was one thing, the hook and the chorus were another. He came up with `He's a good one, he's a pretty good one, he's a good one.' The rest is history. I like that song, really love it.``\n\nThis song can be considered to be from a similar and important period of time. As part of his continuing effort to prove his musical merit, Cash tried to cash some of the checks he had written in favor of his label Universal Records. His efforts and the subsequent lawsuit that resulted resulted in a $2 million settlement, proved lucrative for Cash, although it was very unlikely that he could ever completely retire from recording. His career, however, also ended up on the fast track to eventual destruction when he committed suicide while under house arrest.\n\nThere are a lot of similar songs associated with this song but they should not be confused with the song. The two are not the same.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","token_len":330,"entropy":[8.0388,7.7727,7.39,0.6485,0.1782,1.4896,2.3395,0.4574,1.3995,12.3411,0.4206,5.1871,1.0279,3.8701,7.3444,0.0758,0.5742,1.4058,1.3546,10.9313,15.3996,6.7548,0.2658,4.3675,1.7936,0.791,5.663,5.2779,5.1984,9.5778,7.0135,11.4278,8.0502,1.168,2.632,0.054,1.9577,2.9689,4.3223,0.5301,2.0243,2.8911,3.1813,0.111,1.3635,2.4563,1.5452,1.2863,2.7717,0.6856,0.677,4.167,1.5029,3.1862,0.3753,2.0947,2.3539,2.0267,2.0354,4.7572,0.0298,0.0182,0.0011,0.0,5.6084,1.4337,0.0208,3.6086,3.4307,5.6763,4.4824,5.5418,0.4923,0.0041,1.137,3.2128,0.0978,0.0443,4.6103,2.3502,4.1387,3.0779,1.2087,0.4577,0.7394,1.241,5.9046,0.6947,1.2236,0.5344,4.1505,3.5011,0.0158,0.3942,5.7137,1.9336,2.4431,0.1702,1.124,3.82,2.6864,1.1118,1.325,1.8014,4.0432,0.6271,1.236,5.769,1.9289,5.9048,2.0123,6.4077,0.9987,2.4448,1.2545,2.921,1.8886,0.4455,1.2826,1.7217,3.4163,0.2979,2.6616,0.0926,0.0135,0.5942,3.5631,5.4071,5.3627,1.8774,0.3388,0.0156,0.5868,2.2929,3.7734,3.9979,1.5396,2.5877,5.0272,2.811,0.6064,2.7815,1.4772,0.841,0.595,1.8712,5.1678,0.518,0.0253,4.5873,5.6137,1.1143,2.2247,2.3562,4.2656,1.3091,0.9409,0.3229,0.2439,4.8642,0.8182,0.1338,1.3017,0.5858,0.192,0.5386,1.2569,0.1456,2.8186,3.2122,2.4656,1.1481,1.7865,1.1733,2.5326,3.3794,1.6589,1.2392,2.1891,5.9169,4.2656,0.6014,0.7091,5.6501,0.5427,0.0002,4.4428,1.7945,5.0054,0.274,4.6771,2.1615,0.3119,5.8586,2.5747,3.6177,6.2844,5.5007,2.2658,0.8365,1.8695,1.872,4.2458,5.3107,0.003,2.1128,5.6581,2.9049,0.0884,5.2728,1.2766,2.0057,4.7659,0.4395,0.253,5.2231,0.5409,5.2694,7.9751,1.4848,0.9613,1.8879,0.869,1.1231,1.5184,2.6663,4.1498,0.0112,1.7748,4.186,6.6457,1.1911,0.5916,3.6427,2.9999,5.4002,1.9387,3.5318,3.6913,2.5373,1.0001,2.0682,0.9725,2.0721,1.8838,2.8788,1.1962,0.6251,2.9326,4.5164,6.9026,0.5193,0.8645,2.0088,3.9516,2.0974,1.7822,6.0163,3.8854,0.2479,0.9308,2.5397,1.6794,5.6502,3.8843,0.2544,2.0822,0.6137,3.8021,2.6933,3.7266,0.6539,0.0146,6.3431,2.6304,3.9025,3.46,0.7678,4.6494,0.0834,2.8538,5.8438,5.2346,2.2839,0.7736,3.8093,0.0598,4.9258,1.474,2.1675,0.006,1.793,0.5968,0.0002,5.2014,0.9112,2.1141,3.4793,0.0406,5.1788,1.1666,5.9238,0.052,2.1045,1.089,4.8232,2.5906,5.5845,1.2098,0.1627,0.7704,0.3651,1.0681,2.1979,3.1123,1.9162,3.7115,1.3487,1.6115,0.7566,0.0023,0.717,0.9978,0.0001,4.8734,2.661,0.0153,0.5829,0.3737]}

Bob Corker of Tennesee says he has asked the State Department for more information about the agreement which will set in motion the lifting of economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions on Iranian military advances in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nEven Republicans who voted for the deal in the Senate do not fully trust the Obama administration to keep its word that it will not break it.","token_len":330,"entropy":[10.3982,1.2968,0.5543,3.205,1.5206,0.4219,7.6734,6.7444,0.1454,0.9318,0.7942,0.82,0.9565,8.0654,0.0017,0.0761,0.159,1.077,2.5436,4.8687,2.0894,2.5137,10.0618,4.1942,0.3836,1.9805,1.5746,3.6424,1.3478,0.6143,0.0795,1.4564,0.2372,0.0149,0.0304,2.0732,2.0504,0.1487,2.5927,2.2503,3.1336,1.2938,2.4635,0.5005,3.8032,0.1027,4.7503,2.0111,1.4712,3.4648,1.4641,1.8623,2.7163,2.8265,0.0251,0.79,4.4908,0.0022,0.0987,2.3279,1.7188,0.1214,5.407,0.0239,2.5707,3.8679,0.1811,1.2751,0.495,1.306,3.4351,0.6943,0.5465,0.6146,0.6494,2.8674,1.3587,1.2075,0.0251,0.0441,0.6646,5.0885,0.0226,0.2292,0.8311,0.0007,2.2031,0.0002,5.2449,5.2618,5.7293,5.5981,2.5164,3.5638,5.5353,0.5096,5.961,2.7096,4.3017,1.192,0.0002,0.2874,1.458,2.5351,2.0662,3.6756,2.3263,2.5012,3.6209,2.5345,0.7444,2.0499,2.3444,0.7018,1.5579,0.3594,0.1448,0.9551,1.7851,0.0388,3.1105,0.8468,0.0075,0.0059,0.7016,3.5751,0.0203,0.5598,0.6086,0.1734,0.7698,4.4151,0.3652,0.8357,0.0002,2.2291,1.9795,5.4354,1.0293,3.1814,2.6672,2.1411,6.0068,1.3207,1.3813,2.7766,1.4405,1.9173,5.7485,0.3182,3.7799,0.1848,0.3366,0.2871,0.8264,3.5621,2.0124,4.1886,0.4002,2.4783,4.1191,1.4939,5.9769,1.3127,0.4005,2.792,0.6572,2.6651,3.2413,0.0798,2.9029,0.2215,0.0002,2.9316,3.0136,5.0598,4.0529,1.8891,2.4054,1.5315,1.556,6.2998,2.3824,2.3522,0.9528,1.4349,1.1062,1.4393,3.4698,2.459,5.9101,3.4774,3.0178,3.5905,2.8735,2.8322,4.6778,0.7183,0.6718,0.4829,4.317,1.2372,5.5479,3.5104,1.0038,4.0756,2.1848,0.1014,1.5394,1.4278,0.15,0.8737,5.2071,4.2769,1.2391,5.454,0.3342,0.6216,1.1212,0.4035,2.0709,0.7472,0.2029,0.0002,5.3443,2.3454,5.1004,1.7916,2.3559,1.1315,1.7133,1.2675,3.4909,2.4473,3.8811,0.2043,0.0983,2.9478,0.4065,1.9063,0.7003,1.1727,1.0962,3.0178,1.92,0.5568,0.1785,2.5871,1.7092,0.3953,0.4753,2.7429,0.0035,1.6496,0.0144,1.9849,5.2803,2.0645,0.0244,5.5587,0.6369,2.4474,5.5347,1.2158,2.3174,0.0065,1.8521,1.7058,0.313,0.7937,0.4706,1.2705,6.7647,3.2327,4.8772,2.3374,0.2593,1.1126,1.3616,0.0124,1.727,0.0357,1.268,0.0949,1.2955,0.1855,0.0042,2.9185,0.1342,5.039,3.1734,5.892,0.8397,1.5123,1.481,0.1592,0.4083,3.2386,0.1174,0.6136,0.0002,5.9378,3.9713,0.7652,3.3526,0.5278,0.1088,1.0399,2.4819,0.9108,0.2015,5.0193,0.0485,3.5746,2.9546,1.3303,1.3295,0.041,1.2839,2.4539,1.2189,1.4365,4.846,1.2508,0.3187,1.8918,4.2279,2.8777,0.3136]}
{"id":872,"ended":true,"length":297,"gen_text":"The cathedral has had perhaps a dozen organs over the course of its history. The earliest is mentioned in a report written to the king of Spain in 1530. Few details survive of what the cathedral has sounded like since. The organ was first put to work at the cathedral in 1547 with musicians playing from 13 different instruments across 15 meters of orchestra. The first major work performed by the organ was the mass on St. Nicholas Day in 1552.\n\nThe great organ and the great congregation.\n\nThe organ and the great congregation were both housed in the same octagonal-shaped basement floor in the south-west part of the cathedral. In the upper parts of the octagonal basement, the floor contained three small galleries with statues of Christ. In the south-western corner of the basement were three long, rectangular galleries with stone shelves, containing the pulpit and the organ. These galleries were accessed via marble floors and passageways. The gallery entrances were flanked by two arches supporting the floor. It was there that the organs played and the faithful watched.\n\nThe organ of the cathedral was the work of a German, Andreas Tiefenthaler, and the great congregation was not as small as one might think. There were about 500 people from many nations living at Saint Nicholas Cathedral. The most important of those present were the Bishop of T\u00fcrkiye, the abbot of the monastery, the abbot of the church, the Grand Master of the Order of Saint John, and the Grand Master of the Grand Duchy of Brest. The members of the choir and others who played the organ were also present.","token_len":330,"entropy":[11.222,3.1504,4.0923,9.0061,3.4308,3.5858,9.0858,3.8746,0.1392,3.8716,0.0013,0.3087,0.9991,1.3389,1.5943,3.1498,3.1418,5.7916,0.2788,1.8093,5.1876,3.0919,4.9389,1.1608,2.7015,1.0362,4.3041,1.0423,2.2638,3.9789,1.6116,10.3763,0.6559,4.3096,1.6533,2.6725,1.7718,3.6371,4.8891,2.9538,0.0359,2.3018,1.7012,2.0117,2.6571,1.0741,3.3227,5.2898,1.3272,1.9785,2.0148,0.3845,1.2865,0.4995,1.3258,4.1697,4.3965,7.0728,2.4667,3.1544,6.0715,2.8574,1.6107,7.6413,5.6612,5.9293,0.7088,4.3525,0.6104,1.4628,2.9923,4.9628,3.523,2.8845,1.2629,0.2091,0.2799,0.2374,1.1917,4.4474,4.1394,3.5281,0.2166,3.3636,1.2417,1.2189,0.7795,3.0578,0.3455,1.4433,0.0081,1.1554,5.8385,1.0955,5.1235,2.0323,3.1414,4.4603,3.5056,1.0614,0.0002,0.9899,1.2195,3.8047,0.8227,1.1033,0.1216,2.5554,2.7507,4.0052,0.2669,0.3594,1.5421,6.3465,0.0693,4.0608,0.1031,6.8229,6.4759,2.9426,0.1865,3.5987,2.1049,1.2962,3.1452,0.0019,0.0296,0.3289,0.3271,3.1827,0.8993,4.9575,3.9302,0.0967,0.0529,2.8564,0.664,1.8694,1.3957,1.1555,5.0271,5.9251,4.062,3.6573,4.2178,2.6797,5.4787,1.0173,3.2436,2.4614,2.2632,0.293,3.1334,0.1831,3.2015,1.0003,0.4899,0.1592,1.0116,2.9539,2.9518,5.2766,2.223,2.6948,3.4484,1.4321,5.7549,3.7686,2.6057,3.6083,1.3131,5.5469,0.0026,0.8765,0.923,1.2661,0.4071,3.759,1.3384,0.6885,3.6514,2.0196,6.0536,5.682,2.1416,5.9461,0.0014,0.0017,1.0301,1.3045,4.8387,4.0895,0.5723,3.3147,0.1953,1.7503,4.1051,0.94,5.7818,1.4015,3.9735,1.0155,5.3343,0.7807,5.8736,0.2232,0.3177,3.409,2.9918,2.5406,0.7867,4.5961,4.1646,0.6765,0.6742,0.0002,0.7261,1.624,4.6443,0.6921,0.8479,1.2867,2.5322,2.8515,0.0061,2.3011,3.0948,2.3106,3.9197,5.2953,3.2324,2.3932,0.0372,0.8983,2.4862,2.6661,2.3073,0.058,0.5043,6.2817,4.6883,4.0091,0.2332,2.765,0.1824,1.1196,0.1098,3.2571,0.1779,2.6429,3.2379,0.8255,4.5003,4.2819,2.6322,3.662,2.1631,5.8566,1.7931,0.9125,0.9457,1.37,4.0825,1.6959,1.6391,2.6579,5.1495,0.5672,0.7767,4.7871,0.153,3.303,6.0876,1.0388,0.0276,0.8504,1.466,5.2097,0.6319,0.2473,0.9813,0.8496,1.7642,0.9844,2.5453,0.5898,0.3689,0.7166,3.2546,1.2858,0.717,5.4007,0.575,0.0977,0.1449,1.828,0.0544,1.7882,1.8779,1.3919,1.2898,0.6133,1.8717,0.1668,0.035,0.0539,3.365,2.3148,0.2928,0.0018,0.0354,4.8651,2.7005,0.3424,1.559,5.7292,0.1102,0.1393,2.179,1.7691,6.6519,2.1079,2.9861,1.351,0.3821,0.8658,1.8491,1.2479,0.2644]}

This will not be the first time a director from Studio 4\u00b0C has directed an anime from an Oshii work, as the late series' writer Masashi Tsuburaya was working on an adaptation of Ghost in the Shell before he passed away.\n\nGhost in the Shell 3D opened in Japan on January 6, and the second installment in the two-part series, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex opened in theaters on January 7.","token_len":330,"entropy":[9.9066,0.4692,1.2114,0.0026,5.1463,2.7786,8.3912,10.8435,8.7555,2.1809,0.0066,0.5745,1.9723,4.0703,6.4533,1.1841,7.1233,1.9926,9.8253,4.3427,6.9367,2.697,1.9785,2.8645,3.4732,1.8983,0.5245,1.8676,3.7821,4.6724,4.1377,0.1762,8.659,8.0521,3.2225,2.9984,1.4167,7.7726,8.4442,6.339,5.2179,1.984,0.7281,4.2386,2.6465,1.1147,3.6385,5.0478,0.9042,3.5214,2.3342,2.2669,4.0034,0.8294,0.3996,2.3997,0.0664,2.924,0.212,0.0008,5.276,4.9086,3.1231,4.3744,1.0574,4.8547,1.2483,4.5565,1.5645,1.0001,4.3487,2.802,6.2482,1.6675,2.4391,2.1043,0.2927,1.399,3.1415,0.8087,1.5048,3.2514,1.3503,1.065,2.5359,2.2492,0.0615,1.1075,5.4137,0.2356,4.7419,5.8951,6.5767,1.603,4.931,5.1222,3.3273,6.6995,0.2563,4.1975,3.8385,0.5867,1.7592,1.5799,1.7813,3.2284,6.3499,1.9314,2.6107,6.4756,1.9198,0.8827,0.0386,0.2401,3.8271,1.6949,1.9102,1.2119,4.109,0.9381,4.3479,2.1821,2.8235,2.6735,5.9116,1.9616,0.7916,5.1124,1.55,0.7294,0.5121,1.7901,2.5412,5.0466,0.354,0.4199,2.7419,3.6235,0.9766,5.7674,1.7565,5.8235,4.9533,2.2253,0.106,1.7325,1.0395,1.7883,0.1227,0.824,0.0003,5.99,1.4721,5.7413,0.2551,1.3774,3.8751,0.628,1.6515,0.4145,1.9814,1.4045,4.3647,3.1006,1.3352,3.7805,1.8569,3.0076,3.133,0.4248,0.3836,1.1766,5.2879,5.9342,1.8041,1.2608,2.4781,2.1084,3.5368,5.6329,1.9271,4.9686,0.804,0.7754,0.0228,1.7661,4.8582,4.2985,1.6522,4.5046,1.4338,2.0612,2.3156,3.0029,2.3643,0.0095,2.685,0.1737,0.8144,0.0002,5.447,0.5358,3.0705,0.0058,0.0002,0.3895,0.0029,0.0792,6.7972,0.2374,1.9757,1.7834,3.0929,0.8863,0.3908,0.5956,4.9912,1.1544,3.6024,1.7247,1.5489,0.0252,0.0135,4.3012,1.9999,0.3185,2.8842,1.5029,4.2683,0.1547,2.9684,0.0005,0.0309,2.6431,3.0238,3.5411,0.2343,5.2934,2.2932,5.1733,0.0699,0.3323,0.2252,0.231,2.8755,2.0274,2.2011,2.9998,2.8603,0.2493,0.0007,0.7679,2.9707,0.6344,0.3964,3.326,3.5774,3.0075,0.0001,1.5966,1.0376,0.3703,2.3453,4.3041,5.8961,4.5834,4.4436,3.7399,0.7867,2.2157,0.9495,0.1459,0.002,2.4405,5.5458,0.7194,1.8852,3.1174,0.0882,2.8387,0.0131,0.0099,0.0056,2.6197,1.4869,0.3259,0.0536,0.6821,0.646,0.0002,4.1716,0.0105,0.0027,0.0018,5.8034,0.3484,2.8499,0.2695,0.2432,0.5902,3.3068,3.8377,0.5119,1.0431,2.9517,3.3591,5.5643,1.9668,0.0683,5.8286,0.1896,0.1364,2.2726,1.1721,0.1247,0.0071,0.0013,0.0004,0.4022,0.4715,0.0017,0.0,5.2389,0.883,1.7619,0.581,2.0485,5.5049,0.1676]}

Upon hearing the draft announcement, Suns fans were eager to see what Nash would be doing in the NBA. During his lone season in Phoenix, Nash was one of the top players in the league.\n\nAn All-Star in his first year, Nash helped lead the Suns to a 55-27 record during his time with the Suns and was named to the all-NBA second team each of his four seasons in Phoenix. However, it would take a handful of years for Nash to have a truly standout NBA career; in 2000, Nash posted a career-low point total on 9.3 PPG as the Suns would be forced into yet another trade away from their star forward.\n\nNash bounced around the NBA in another trade away from the Suns before retiring with the Chicago Bulls in February of 2003. Nash's time away from the NBA was not without its challenges, as there were accusations of drug and alcohol abuse during his second stint with the Bulls.\n\nAs a part of the 2004 NBA draft in Chicago, the Lakers selected Andrew Bynum as the new No. 3 overall selection. The Lakers immediately went on a rebuilding plan, picking up a rookie in Brandon Bass and drafting Omer Asik, which turned out to be one of the greatest trades in Lakers history.\n\nNow with the Houston Rockets, the Lakers are no longer rebuilding and are on their way to a dynasty in the making. Kobe Bryant and the Lakers are looking to become the first NBA team to repeat as NBA champions since 1992-93.","token_len":336,"entropy":[6.8537,3.1029,0.4208,1.0925,0.0264,4.1104,0.6892,8.632,2.461,5.2845,6.9657,0.0056,0.1317,0.5359,0.1362,3.2927,0.5174,0.2634,0.1637,3.8427,0.031,0.1246,0.0256,3.447,0.1343,1.3006,0.1841,5.9706,7.0214,1.009,6.19,3.5596,0.2317,5.1686,3.0301,1.6183,4.9854,0.1303,0.4287,1.7417,0.7054,0.9985,2.9803,3.8414,1.1224,0.4996,0.6557,0.3469,4.8836,0.4392,5.2986,0.2761,0.7109,0.4295,0.082,0.1743,2.5335,3.397,0.0062,0.1405,3.0594,1.5621,0.4455,0.0414,0.3931,1.1509,2.3962,0.0008,6.0618,1.1487,0.0319,0.0583,0.9953,1.3385,0.8899,1.126,1.2114,0.1396,3.3038,1.1,0.2332,0.0728,0.0515,1.2835,4.2982,0.0426,0.1114,0.0901,3.7578,1.268,2.2434,1.1706,0.1519,2.0899,2.4495,1.2366,0.4859,0.7235,0.1573,4.4676,0.012,0.2675,0.9524,0.0234,5.6242,0.5481,0.9887,3.5014,0.2657,1.0846,0.2781,0.068,3.8472,0.0281,2.8691,2.5383,2.7447,1.7609,5.8288,0.0106,2.7542,0.7496,0.1736,0.0841,5.2691,0.9779,2.9369,4.2814,2.8347,2.9086,5.3214,2.904,3.0652,0.7013,0.5054,5.4797,1.2929,0.9959,0.5076,0.9251,2.5724,0.2341,6.3594,4.9142,0.0909,2.2329,4.3999,0.0004,3.7053,0.82,0.2211,6.0439,3.6357,3.4822,3.1146,6.4852,0.0029,2.6441,6.5655,0.0233,1.5647,1.3293,2.8401,0.1026,0.492,0.0002,1.6756,0.0031,3.7841,0.6365,0.6119,1.3547,2.8311,6.57,1.1692,4.5087,0.1675,1.0644,0.1757,2.198,4.0428,4.0992,0.612,3.9547,0.005,0.4339,6.131,0.7641,1.8853,0.2679,2.0873,2.4639,2.3463,4.7186,0.0425,0.0653,0.9635,1.3502,2.6071,1.3161,1.0411,3.1921,1.4508,0.9143,6.0637,0.3969,5.5119,0.9098,2.5549,3.2712,0.0966,0.2829,1.6926,0.2947,5.8967,0.4261,0.8671,0.0621,0.3335,0.3117,1.3033,0.0002,4.2296,1.4622,4.1522,0.0789,0.2432,3.3454,1.258,1.8977,5.288,1.5482,0.0249,1.0358,4.0118,0.7116,5.4742,0.1108,0.0,0.0,5.1627,0.5189,5.5985,3.6245,0.0049,4.4193,0.1784,2.347,0.4274,2.3187,1.0745,3.991,3.9044,1.494,1.0941,2.8389,2.1058,1.2472,4.3845,0.1117,2.6844,4.6438,2.2218,4.4906,0.8004,1.1209,2.1412,5.6943,2.6274,0.0009,0.0,2.9798,3.8463,4.4236,0.1104,0.0433,0.0252,2.5594,0.0074,0.0317,3.0351,1.7644,0.4819,1.4809,0.3438,0.1128,0.7859,0.0002,5.7408,2.4129,0.5839,3.4503,0.0031,0.1066,2.6346,2.3516,1.9335,5.5141,0.2543,2.0688,1.0779,0.9876,3.4395,1.2621,0.1085,0.2557,1.4744,5.3486,2.171,0.3053,1.7031,0.1318,5.2498,0.0515,2.0018,1.5728,0.5421,1.0208,2.9907,0.2935,3.2536,0.4727,0.5668,2.4165,0.2514,0.1748,1.811,0.1019,0.9044,0.2897,0.4283,6.0245,2.1502,0.4257,1.0604]}
{"id":3277,"ended":true,"length":305,"gen_text":"On 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya. Vittorio Emanuele served as the flagship of Vice Admiral Augusto Aubry, the commander of the 1st Fleet 'which has in its fleet almost as many ships, many officers and sailors, and more than 20,000 men' as the Imperial Japanese Navy has in its fleet to date. The Italians landed at Pirelli on 25 October and advanced southwards. By 20 December, the Italian ships had captured the Libyan port of Zid, and on 26 December had captured Tripoli. Then on 5 January, they began the assault on Sidi Bouzid. This led to the fall of the city and the capture of the Governorate on 9 January. A week later the Italian forces moved on the coastal city of Tripolitania, now known as Lampedusa, and captured it on 12 April. Next, the Italian forces attacked the city of Tobruk, which had the largest naval base and the most naval craft. As part of their invasion plan however, the Italians used a blockade known as the 'Gallic System'. This prevented the ports of Antwerp in Belgium, Bruges in Belgium and Lausanne in Switzerland from being used as means of carrying supplies from Libya. On 12 January 1912, the Italian armies launched a full scale attack on Benghazi, setting fires and destroying public buildings, the governor's palace, mosques and religious sites. Then, on 20 January, the Italians entered the city, and on 26 January the capture of Benghazi by the Italians was announced. The Italian Government called this 'the most beautiful victory of the naval war'.","token_len":337,"entropy":[8.8118,2.4071,7.184,0.3933,8.1351,2.1142,0.0583,0.1306,2.0295,1.129,0.0341,3.61,3.2749,0.0118,5.8825,5.8079,2.5193,8.6355,0.3645,0.0145,2.5081,0.0003,0.0007,0.0008,9.0099,0.6416,1.6421,10.0581,0.3514,8.6459,1.029,7.6042,0.0093,11.7793,3.5787,1.2452,1.5379,1.4567,0.1268,0.1776,6.0692,0.0337,2.1917,9.423,5.5748,4.1639,5.1572,1.8284,3.5628,5.1122,2.5216,0.1646,2.0736,4.0158,4.676,3.6942,0.5163,3.3457,0.7955,0.8857,3.227,1.4411,4.0335,0.2018,0.0046,0.6245,2.1455,1.5891,0.6767,4.6436,2.0926,0.1622,5.5699,2.4037,0.2624,0.9201,5.7129,1.9655,0.5067,2.0367,2.7498,4.8212,1.3811,4.9917,3.8633,0.1944,1.6473,3.2503,0.9257,2.1394,4.007,4.2047,0.919,1.9913,2.948,4.0043,2.1572,0.8724,1.4182,1.6137,4.2585,0.5279,1.4847,1.7404,3.9235,1.2113,0.0563,2.7314,5.0176,2.2687,1.4091,2.0896,3.4717,0.3396,4.0951,1.5551,1.6001,0.5922,6.2088,1.4426,3.0996,0.1849,2.1712,2.4126,3.8536,2.12,3.1703,0.1675,5.1475,0.1709,1.9351,1.0187,0.0005,0.7679,4.0475,4.6504,0.1563,0.6334,2.7285,0.0144,0.8661,0.7017,2.3439,0.4076,2.0118,0.0476,0.9868,5.09,2.372,3.6218,2.9167,0.4725,1.1098,4.4734,2.6793,0.0693,2.3741,1.2398,2.0458,3.0353,0.8347,1.6692,2.5537,1.4785,0.0209,6.0629,0.1134,0.0057,0.902,5.0147,1.2774,0.0416,7.1592,1.2252,0.0,1.1399,0.9707,2.4212,0.3592,0.2793,2.5464,4.6467,0.3981,5.6146,1.0189,1.2525,0.8439,0.8187,3.3642,0.6659,2.2807,0.0196,2.4208,0.0001,0.0003,0.7389,1.6419,1.3523,4.7921,1.7148,2.9348,0.3457,4.6038,1.6678,2.1535,4.3259,5.1372,2.0533,4.8745,4.2725,0.0022,2.3619,3.8911,1.1223,6.8103,0.0739,0.432,0.6762,4.4006,1.9099,4.6442,5.9174,0.0158,0.4925,1.2302,3.6364,4.0357,3.9455,1.4221,1.1488,4.2019,1.1155,3.21,0.6545,5.5347,0.6498,0.0086,4.0714,0.2741,1.3285,2.6763,0.6451,0.0061,0.216,0.3079,0.9797,4.8679,6.8266,0.0,0.1084,0.0057,0.1283,0.9565,0.3081,2.2355,5.092,0.1592,5.1648,1.1005,2.9996,2.3375,1.2509,3.2593,3.5011,3.8263,0.4233,0.2069,0.6107,1.0064,5.8961,3.7797,1.3072,3.5796,0.8542,1.104,0.19,4.6315,1.0202,5.6205,5.6606,1.1901,1.7142,6.194,0.1385,1.9595,3.3783,3.9717,0.6572,0.7546,1.05,3.509,0.5083,5.3109,1.8183,0.329,4.2909,1.4792,0.4412,3.2031,0.3199,0.4835,0.8075,1.9457,4.0986,1.0122,0.654,1.9516,1.7778,1.3167,3.4659,0.314,1.8746,4.8703,0.0378,1.792,2.8795,0.4512,1.6158,1.7534,1.9743,0.1714,1.5919,1.5067,4.9481,4.5529,2.5854,2.3687,0.6724,2.6345,5.6487,2.2012,0.9579,0.4732,3.4532,1.4013,0.9237]}

The government with the army which was then available to it, could have met the case on a peaceful footing '.\n\n\nThe next spring, the Tribune published a number of letters from members of the South's secessionist parties, urging that they consider offering peace to the Confederacy, with the hope that they would reconsider their position during the presidential campaign of 1868.\n\n\nIn its editorial, however, the Tribune argued that the South ought to have fought on, that the war '... has given to the South a great and important and glorious opportunity, for doing for some time to the country's moral and political future what had been promised to it in its charter of 1781 '.\n\n\nGreeley, who was also the principal author of the Civil War memorial in Washington DC, did not support the North's decision to go to war.\n\n\nThe Tribune's anti-war position had remained constant in Greeley's journalism for two decades, and he became an apologist for the North during and after the War between the States.","token_len":338,"entropy":[2.4605,5.5558,5.5237,0.2362,0.2347,0.0417,2.1895,4.2012,5.0555,0.0963,10.1115,0.2737,2.7247,2.2213,4.6368,5.7623,11.616,0.4189,0.0957,3.7187,0.6189,2.8535,1.9371,0.0003,1.3653,4.4462,0.208,9.2478,6.0663,0.017,0.1303,3.1554,2.5081,0.6911,1.8615,4.4979,1.9198,2.4476,0.7039,4.89,0.0002,2.3078,0.1072,0.0078,6.212,1.0828,4.2284,0.553,4.8404,0.1097,0.6208,0.0008,0.0754,1.3892,1.7635,3.4937,2.4172,4.5129,0.1786,10.8701,7.9432,3.6575,4.5957,1.7387,5.26,2.5368,3.9435,2.4619,0.0828,3.893,0.007,1.5335,1.9322,4.5295,0.2078,0.9736,5.1076,3.6594,1.606,0.3205,2.8885,5.1934,2.5285,0.4998,0.9847,5.587,4.4155,1.823,1.4615,3.0746,2.2638,1.3459,1.5802,0.309,3.3454,7.8949,9.0582,5.3222,2.3765,1.1238,3.265,3.7811,2.684,1.4925,3.0741,1.2994,6.6689,2.0531,1.8763,2.6438,5.2287,2.6602,1.6965,1.2769,1.0133,1.2634,3.3373,5.9244,0.3672,1.4985,1.42,4.3456,6.1179,3.2188,1.3032,4.8082,0.7051,0.8033,1.1259,2.519,5.1502,6.4504,2.3627,3.8024,2.7643,3.1966,2.0572,4.5285,2.7195,0.3715,1.562,1.876,0.7538,5.3598,0.6883,5.2586,4.5158,2.6878,3.9711,1.6435,9.0048,0.7402,0.0002,2.1052,4.1822,4.2222,0.3887,1.715,1.5435,1.5954,1.1017,4.7569,0.0042,2.4628,0.8324,5.2879,0.0139,0.4235,3.2636,2.7426,4.4337,0.3426,4.2693,0.962,2.2691,2.2902,2.4929,4.8883,6.3762,2.5643,1.2028,0.2531,3.2242,2.0573,4.4607,0.6308,2.2588,0.3482,2.4898,0.7965,6.0632,0.6093,1.5544,5.1681,0.2029,4.6676,1.636,0.7518,0.2181,1.6583,0.1194,1.08,0.0003,2.1857,4.7682,0.9075,1.0282,3.2996,0.0115,0.2741,0.1272,2.9301,0.3908,1.2498,1.3718,4.8339,0.4381,4.0678,2.8386,1.0389,1.615,4.0309,1.4176,1.8891,4.158,8.6728,3.697,4.4559,2.5448,0.5599,1.1443,1.1709,3.2532,2.6359,3.9085,5.2704,2.9205,2.0264,1.8754,3.6554,5.2129,2.8887,6.0945,0.4088,0.6837,1.4056,2.1357,2.5193,4.78,0.5097,0.373,4.4289,0.5499,4.3873,1.2679,5.6569,1.0381,0.6217,1.4909,2.7967,4.3103,3.3957,2.1524,2.617,2.4367,0.2847,0.0002,2.0569,0.0401,0.0094,2.9491,1.6803,1.5708,3.982,1.9002,5.8838,1.9304,0.037,0.1704,4.7501,0.0653,3.3579,1.8247,1.2926,2.221,0.1897,4.1322,0.1231,2.7839,0.5824,3.9585,0.1889,1.966,0.0502,2.9729,0.0136,0.0034,1.0028,1.3694,0.0002,2.676,1.461,1.5302,3.7207,0.0114,0.6552,2.1484,3.2614,5.5639,3.0879,3.7905,1.0514,0.002,0.0272,6.0788,2.6663,3.986,1.3286,1.0122,1.6835,2.0739,4.7417,2.9134,4.7032,0.0345,0.03,0.4273,2.4254,2.3384,3.913,0.1038,0.0546,4.4537,3.8865,0.017,0.0026,0.2666]}

This means that the Bismark had a royal grey colour scheme with a white ship in the centre, with the British lion on a silver disc atop the ship.\n\nHer deck was fitted with an anti-aircraft gun turret, 2 x torpedo tubes and a wireless station which was set on the right hand side of the ship.\n\nAfter she was released from the Fleet she was sunk on 8 March 1945 by the USS Hood which had a collision with her while returning to Malta that day as they docked.\n\n(Source: Historic Ships of the World- The Illustrated Naval Encyclopedia, 2004)","token_len":340,"entropy":[8.5045,7.2923,8.2079,9.27,10.953,6.7185,11.1658,5.9618,6.8347,4.548,5.5992,4.2049,7.5156,3.9789,8.1395,1.0118,4.038,0.0299,0.2026,2.7399,3.5834,2.1723,0.3913,4.4474,0.2998,0.8151,5.268,2.6999,2.8266,2.3624,2.9657,1.0088,4.826,1.0844,0.0463,3.5204,3.1984,0.2551,5.3423,0.3012,2.1113,1.8802,1.973,0.9357,4.0249,0.7289,3.7981,1.4353,1.6481,2.4495,5.4169,0.9073,4.164,1.2532,1.9629,3.6461,0.4851,2.5666,2.2694,1.0309,3.6675,3.3601,0.1797,2.0654,3.6018,1.3978,3.2751,0.0534,0.9627,3.73,2.6924,4.3247,0.3865,0.2837,1.2913,0.0184,4.6546,2.6542,0.8676,4.2373,0.0041,0.4104,4.409,3.516,1.634,1.6888,1.8882,0.0028,5.0352,0.0087,0.2617,6.0783,4.4839,0.149,1.6119,4.0623,2.2104,1.1702,5.5613,0.4602,1.6559,0.5811,0.4587,0.715,2.5295,1.6427,1.6043,2.0516,3.4345,1.9973,0.4002,1.4896,0.0002,1.8611,1.5948,0.0283,0.3087,0.7382,2.9249,2.5809,2.8378,0.0405,1.4725,3.4648,1.2807,1.2502,1.552,1.325,5.0449,3.4385,0.3534,6.2591,0.236,2.028,3.4614,1.078,3.848,0.5574,1.7803,4.8141,2.9235,5.2512,5.8251,0.7014,2.0362,1.8333,4.5283,6.7999,2.6012,1.8684,0.2114,0.0004,0.0001,0.0013,0.9979,2.5615,0.0028,0.0028,0.3747,3.6369,0.4675,0.9389,0.0002,1.219,0.9389,0.0053,0.2033,0.674,5.1004,0.6603,1.6455,5.0621,0.0011,7.5384,3.5524,1.7163,1.4565,3.4411,3.2621,0.8022,5.2362,2.4826,1.4379,5.5778,3.3082,6.4934,6.2343,3.3012,4.6798,2.4723,2.924,2.4727,4.9715,3.8546,1.2937,4.8506,4.4124,4.0255,1.3332,2.3143,2.9628,4.7364,0.2572,2.4291,1.2968,5.157,0.024,1.1496,1.6244,1.0298,6.0139,0.4492,0.1848,4.871,0.8342,0.4673,3.4758,5.3769,0.4452,1.2292,1.7458,0.0027,0.0845,2.3912,1.5949,5.1288,6.1849,1.4101,0.033,2.0092,1.7425,2.0813,4.8583,2.787,0.6919,0.5819,2.885,2.2215,1.3056,4.6411,2.3751,1.628,1.6142,4.3926,4.7662,6.5177,0.6448,1.3056,0.6305,1.0185,0.0002,3.4164,4.4846,0.7859,4.3642,0.1229,4.039,1.9483,0.091,0.1743,0.0105,1.2385,2.3494,2.0486,4.3635,2.1221,4.1591,0.2666,0.938,1.3294,5.5568,2.462,4.414,0.7375,4.8399,1.8262,0.7369,4.7639,1.0493,0.1221,0.5568,0.0996,0.6002,0.464,1.471,0.0002,4.4444,3.6425,0.4211,4.6735,0.4353,0.6514,3.5819,1.0529,0.4397,5.4024,2.5043,3.9162,2.8297,0.8928,1.329,1.314,2.3116,5.4042,3.2552,1.8834,3.9137,4.3876,0.1815,0.4438,2.0684,3.3503,0.6998,3.937,7.134,0.7294,5.7166,3.4155,5.8646,0.0242,0.8176,0.9301,0.0002,5.3342,2.7514,0.1164,3.966,0.6496,1.8038,0.191,1.3527,7.4298,2.8435,3.8961,2.811,2.4195,1.4496,5.0227,0.7625]}

Though the book contains only a handful of new titles, the authors have spent months acquiring the largest corpus of new French-language comics ever assembled for academic study. The majority of the study is based on a systematic review of published comics, followed by a detailed analysis of the production process, character development, and production values. The authors argue that the new French-language comics represent a rich new perspective on some of the key issues concerning what makes comics so successful, and argue that they contribute to the ongoing scholarly debate on the production and reading of comics.\n\nWhile the introduction describes the collection in great detail, and the first three chapters lay out some of the history of French-language comics in the United States (including an explanation of the influence of France on the American comic book industry, the earliest comic book covers from the 1930s, and how these comics reflected changing cultural and political currents), the final two chapters provide an in-depth analysis of several recent French-language comic books.\n\nAn excellent read for anyone interested in the past, present and future of comic books and the comics-illustrated material they embody.","token_len":344,"entropy":[4.1055,0.9929,9.148,5.0017,1.1289,3.5604,2.6075,0.4515,0.0025,0.636,0.1446,8.0683,4.1084,0.6681,3.7058,8.8739,1.3777,2.1675,3.9946,0.96,5.8136,4.8316,0.0004,0.5148,8.6792,2.3964,2.0997,5.6881,16.4508,8.8382,12.4579,9.2684,2.0437,2.1006,0.3887,9.7433,5.5207,0.2071,1.6005,2.9652,4.4972,5.8067,0.8731,3.2568,1.404,0.5499,0.5771,1.6888,0.006,3.3641,0.4074,0.3991,0.2919,1.1599,1.353,1.1999,4.3282,0.4086,4.8778,3.168,0.7756,2.4558,1.0573,3.0496,0.802,0.5037,0.1661,1.7958,0.0057,0.0001,1.0266,5.4863,3.0631,1.833,4.2689,2.032,5.4829,1.7217,1.3113,3.9284,1.5383,0.5465,5.0126,3.9642,0.0218,0.6596,3.0101,0.0279,5.4137,0.0101,4.7281,3.9469,2.52,0.4557,1.1894,0.9704,0.0092,2.5446,4.947,2.8987,2.8767,0.7461,2.652,3.5991,0.0028,0.8895,5.4386,4.022,0.4327,4.235,0.2722,3.4908,1.3602,0.0416,1.8135,2.2805,5.467,1.6566,2.3968,3.7007,3.1596,1.0123,1.565,0.0142,4.185,3.8394,0.3625,1.8521,2.9701,2.7248,4.0725,2.6429,5.6808,2.082,5.8885,5.9411,0.0625,3.5366,1.1141,0.5823,0.007,0.2594,1.2844,0.5172,3.0503,4.2774,0.3901,0.2649,1.878,5.6879,0.1497,0.3814,6.2335,1.377,2.0885,0.0905,2.2326,4.332,2.1521,0.0944,3.8968,1.8264,1.7121,5.5696,0.0253,0.9871,2.3771,1.4588,0.1089,1.1027,4.2586,1.9545,1.6366,6.0374,2.4232,0.5311,1.3476,3.7767,3.2187,0.7428,1.4902,1.8258,4.9292,0.084,1.1548,3.5027,3.2368,1.2898,0.0057,0.1071,3.4501,0.5548,4.9216,2.8033,5.7617,0.1512,5.553,0.0884,0.1195,3.3305,1.5882,5.3491,5.9133,2.8631,1.639,3.157,3.4079,2.1988,1.2846,5.5473,0.19,2.1963,4.8332,0.2986,1.4637,2.3882,3.5604,0.6447,1.5117,0.5933,4.1393,0.9841,5.2939,0.0754,0.1894,0.3792,0.504,0.0002,5.1536,1.0196,6.1008,3.7575,0.4276,4.9019,2.931,4.4122,0.112,0.0778,5.1747,1.0022,2.9405,2.1211,0.1105,5.4626,0.1581,4.3294,0.1775,0.0636,3.3308,0.4503,0.7015,0.8167,0.0055,0.0587,1.8593,1.658,0.7221,0.0021,4.1736,2.2872,3.2409,4.9714,0.0332,0.6268,5.0103,0.0947,4.6337,0.8225,1.2837,1.3444,1.5607,0.9413,0.5436,2.8273,1.7554,5.4928,2.8644,0.8552,5.6046,3.6724,0.6954,1.7254,0.0258,0.5264,0.2883,3.6745,5.8447,3.0584,4.6391,4.4787,1.8969,1.8859,0.3905,2.954,0.6839,0.3159,1.4614,1.4093,0.02,2.6976,1.9267,1.4019,0.0216,0.0008,1.0878,0.0296,3.5341,3.5843,0.6384,0.1186,0.0041,2.3731,0.3809,0.9352,1.8981,0.0003,5.3729,3.7794,4.2036,0.8811,1.5209,0.2688,0.0081,0.9466,6.166,0.5268,0.1961,1.4815,0.024,0.0577,4.125,0.1311,3.1177,1.6473,3.0477,3.6352,6.1803,0.318,0.2191,5.9618,1.448,4.9847,1.0888]}

His career fell into disarray and he spent the rest of his life in poverty. In November 1781 he was given a suspended sentence of three-and-seventeen months hard labour and a fine of 200 guineas for attempting to seduce a 16-year-old girl during a public performance in London. He was also handed 30 days for having sexual relations with his half-sister. In June 1784 Wilde was forced to leave London for good, but he returned in 1790 with a new reputation for \"good company\".He was married twice\u2014 twice\u2014and had an eight-year-old son. As a young man he was extremely good-looking and he enjoyed flippancy but seemed to be very reserved and reticent to show emotion. His first marriage lasted from 1787 to 1794, and although he divorced her he never remarried. He lived with her daughter Frances O'Neill in Grafton Close. His second marriage began in 1797 and lasted twenty-two years\u2014until his death.He served in Parliament (Parl) from 1799 to 1802, and then became mayor of London in 1803 (having been elected the previous year) but went into retirement after a scandal broke out in the British Parliament and he had to resign.He died in the same year (1803) because of a heart attack as he dined with three friends in London. He was buried in St Dunstan's Churchyard in London.","token_len":344,"entropy":[5.9919,2.5978,6.6485,7.1462,8.9496,0.0007,0.9749,6.4143,3.0623,0.0007,0.0006,0.3363,1.5186,4.1991,0.0002,0.0251,0.0054,0.0018,0.0002,0.1604,1.3116,6.5509,3.2476,7.1638,1.811,2.4872,3.1185,0.1226,0.8072,0.5851,0.6846,12.2973,1.6072,1.0238,3.2853,1.1295,5.1917,7.2981,4.5645,3.746,3.0425,0.1649,1.9243,3.5121,3.7752,5.9441,1.4851,2.0681,0.6692,2.0546,0.5025,2.2427,0.9118,0.795,0.0021,0.0993,0.1593,0.8188,1.968,0.6499,3.4078,5.6986,3.677,4.4605,1.1165,0.819,4.2343,0.7989,5.2286,0.1261,2.0891,1.544,4.5398,0.1643,0.0021,8.1238,0.0131,2.6943,0.4629,5.227,0.0659,2.6328,1.4064,0.619,0.0851,3.8297,0.9165,0.0008,0.0,1.8748,5.8783,0.0634,3.2095,0.0004,0.6122,3.6333,0.1694,0.0103,0.0607,0.0021,0.4199,5.4709,0.7912,3.4764,0.745,2.1245,1.771,0.3356,1.639,0.7159,1.3589,6.0817,6.7718,0.4057,2.1875,2.7579,2.8275,0.9069,0.038,2.6888,4.7826,0.0411,0.0795,0.0022,1.5549,2.8934,4.4321,0.065,2.4421,3.6299,0.4997,4.9862,0.1063,1.8922,1.3789,1.4481,1.83,1.2473,3.2775,1.2047,2.2255,1.5137,0.6276,3.0821,3.0615,1.4309,1.0518,4.445,3.1456,4.241,4.102,3.6601,1.3451,7.5302,1.5297,4.4013,1.8075,5.1906,7.4329,1.5114,1.5589,0.6915,4.3066,3.9368,0.068,0.1808,0.1986,0.049,0.5581,1.6547,4.9641,1.6211,2.201,0.1336,0.7519,1.5047,4.9118,4.8603,0.2001,0.059,1.1371,3.6562,4.1271,4.0548,6.4173,0.6026,4.4181,5.7517,0.5179,1.7587,3.5586,4.8821,1.1449,4.0094,0.0004,3.1738,2.4543,1.5681,0.2912,2.2212,2.5962,0.9658,2.3954,2.7263,0.293,4.078,0.3165,0.1881,3.2317,0.8472,1.2787,4.3549,0.8474,5.0145,1.0871,1.8686,2.0279,0.1945,0.008,0.0001,0.2694,1.2179,4.3025,1.5914,3.5966,2.8672,5.8901,5.7368,0.0512,2.9549,1.7951,5.7309,1.2044,0.0005,2.2153,2.8205,2.7815,0.1879,0.2584,3.609,0.3524,0.4367,2.1514,0.8868,0.1078,3.7681,0.5261,1.8669,0.019,4.0276,2.9085,0.4642,0.08,1.7637,3.6487,6.2609,1.129,2.869,4.5581,7.1556,2.2388,2.8468,0.7008,0.1972,2.4327,0.5016,0.2846,2.3029,0.9615,0.8852,2.8538,2.4803,6.5121,0.0592,0.2763,0.7378,0.0905,1.7724,4.3869,4.3012,1.2484,1.2049,3.5721,0.5519,0.1745,2.6175,3.0667,6.488,1.1164,3.5364,2.3051,2.3149,3.54,3.0615,0.5473,1.3004,1.9939,4.4371,1.3441,3.3302,0.8998,2.9888,0.0602,0.798,0.4916,3.0842,2.1458,0.8792,3.0633,3.0204,0.1813,3.7253,0.1428,0.7901,0.4824,6.078,0.3025,1.5645,2.3497,0.0688,5.8073,0.2255,6.3581,0.0099,0.5612,7.0073,1.2796,1.7621,3.1426,0.6684,1.6294,0.452,0.1562,0.3906,1.883,6.5758,0.0997,0.0274,0.4406,0.2377,1.3808,1.6644,0.4962]}

The records of his auditions survive in the Archives Nationales, where they were preserved in the National Collection of Musicians (hereafter referred to simply as NMBM). In the NMBM records we can discover that he was in the top 10% of players in the Conservatory, and was chosen for the training program of the Conservatoire and thus the NMBM.\n\n\nAlkan was also good at music theory. This can be seen by the notes in the music written by him : it has always been a mystery how he could perform the organ so well with so little playing time.\n\n\nAlkan was a devoted composer. He published a number of works, some of which are still considered to be among the finest examples of his style.\n\n\nHe was extremely hard working. He was not only a composer, but also a teacher, who often wrote and composed with his pupils.\n\n\nAlkan was a man of many talents. He studied at the Conservatoire de Paris, the Concertgebouw van Amsterdam, and the Concertgebouw van Wachau.\n\n\nWe do not have any further information regarding the circumstances of the death of Alkan. When asked by his sister for further details, she only replied that \"he is buried somewhere near Paris\".\n\n\n(Note: this information is extracted from the book \"Lebensraum\" by Michael Neave, published by the National Library of Wales (UK), 2005., ISBN: 978-813-0918-04-6)","token_len":345,"entropy":[10.4908,6.5824,2.6129,6.244,3.3498,0.0008,1.9142,1.238,6.0449,0.8462,8.4116,4.0044,0.001,1.8324,1.6792,2.1738,6.0959,5.3088,1.1817,0.0049,0.7941,1.3921,3.5311,5.0936,3.784,0.04,4.0857,1.2233,4.0707,9.0026,0.7826,0.2859,6.0343,0.0025,8.6693,2.806,0.8408,4.3938,2.8578,0.0579,2.5009,3.0299,1.2551,3.0079,3.1922,1.7569,1.4097,3.4455,4.7361,0.4043,2.8328,0.2139,3.3311,5.547,0.4947,2.7015,0.005,2.4004,0.0227,3.1698,2.6698,0.3133,0.3819,2.6159,2.265,3.9847,0.0041,0.0024,2.856,2.9383,1.154,5.413,1.4926,1.658,1.0325,4.2263,1.5339,1.3205,2.254,0.7908,0.209,4.9146,0.8598,1.6704,0.6779,3.2778,1.9336,0.8662,1.9245,4.8078,1.5175,0.6978,6.0384,0.9059,1.9134,0.4293,1.229,0.0935,0.0016,5.4772,6.2809,2.9765,4.5049,0.0335,0.001,0.601,3.8155,0.0003,4.1407,0.0143,1.5247,2.8499,5.2174,0.4262,2.2767,0.8685,0.7768,4.1173,4.5219,0.0743,0.5471,2.5724,0.8296,5.1271,2.3688,0.813,3.9384,3.4865,0.6084,1.161,8.4127,4.6552,3.2545,5.0817,0.2,2.377,2.633,1.4978,0.6587,1.1893,4.271,2.0696,4.3998,1.4984,0.6378,3.2215,1.7455,0.484,5.1637,2.6269,0.4087,2.4862,0.0003,1.8603,0.0103,1.4988,1.8757,5.7164,4.0165,1.0376,0.768,4.3457,1.8829,1.5884,0.0015,1.4617,1.2033,3.1623,0.3921,0.4882,1.3606,1.6997,4.3367,1.5636,0.0373,1.6517,0.2524,1.8396,3.7502,0.0789,3.238,1.9186,0.476,1.9237,0.0003,2.8905,0.9894,5.2129,4.698,0.9616,0.961,0.8876,1.7996,3.7022,0.9783,0.6404,2.152,0.4042,0.2621,0.3472,0.4579,1.2545,1.2027,3.6397,4.096,3.2482,3.0394,2.8808,3.5289,1.0946,1.1665,0.3931,1.3022,0.0002,1.2815,0.0089,0.8988,1.0806,2.747,0.1888,2.3247,0.5674,0.4955,0.5153,4.9704,2.5508,0.338,0.3682,0.0582,0.0006,0.9798,0.0325,0.8024,2.0642,5.4243,0.0978,0.0089,0.003,0.0169,5.8137,0.4627,0.3634,1.1832,0.4114,3.5981,0.0079,0.0009,0.0025,0.0057,1.8022,4.2951,4.9155,0.3529,0.562,1.6946,0.0003,4.5953,3.2253,0.0641,2.5605,1.395,4.1461,0.3069,3.101,1.7845,2.6623,0.5457,3.5298,0.9753,0.0845,0.3689,0.0049,1.2382,6.4504,2.7523,1.8951,1.4307,4.222,4.9035,3.4224,1.2041,0.5802,0.9011,4.0103,1.4653,0.7469,2.1655,0.9583,3.9255,2.7843,3.6895,2.6134,2.3904,0.7859,0.6283,0.0002,4.6256,4.0361,0.7889,3.1478,1.9603,1.0896,3.8692,0.0978,0.8228,2.93,0.7742,3.804,6.3156,0.2873,2.3868,0.0059,2.8095,0.4909,4.6921,5.1062,5.7513,0.9344,1.0487,0.5105,2.1111,2.6075,0.4687,0.0615,1.9925,3.1724,2.7236,1.9749,4.666,7.3332,0.5796,1.31,0.9995,0.3188,5.7919,3.3396,2.3089,4.6892,4.602,2.536,4.7023,0.1183,2.4769,1.4832]}

It made its final flyby of that giant planet in 2012.\nIt's the fourth time Saturn's rings have been caught in such stunning images. On Nov. 20, 1996, Galileo's photos of the planet's rings were the first ever used to study the intricate structure of the interplanetary magnetic field and thus the nature of moons and planetary rings. And on Jan. 30, 2002, Cassini snapped the first pictures of four new moons circling the planet. The images are so detailed that they can reveal fine-scale detail; one image reveals a canyon inside the Great Red Spot, with a width twice that of a football field.\nThe last time a Saturnian moon was captured in such a fashion was in 1836, when Newcomb's comet swept its tails across Venus' face. The photos and video captured by Cassini and others, however, are a new and much better opportunity to study the inner workings of the planet's rings.\nThe photos, based on images taken by Cassini on Dec. 19 and 20, 2008, were released last week by the American Space Agency (ASA.) (via New Scientist )\nThe Cassini site also says, \"The dramatic colors (tinted only by the sun's light reflected off the rings) highlight the deep structure of the rings: the icy particles in the rings are the same thickness over a wide region.\" They also provide the video.

At Elmwood Avenue, NY 47 turned north onto St. Paul Street. The exit to Rochester was at Elmwood Avenue. NY 97 turned south onto St. Paul Street, across from the Elmwood Avenue exit. NY 97 turned east onto St. Paul Street near the intersection with West Main Street. This exit was closed after the railroad crossing was upgraded. NY 97 continued east on St. Paul Street where it formed a concurrency with NY 41 and the ramp to New Brighton Road. The ramp to New Brighton Road was closed after the railroad crossing was upgraded.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if the US 38\/NY 46 bypass would be an option to bypass the crossing. Currently, New Brighton Road is being utilized to cross the Rochester line into Elmwood. The ramps to NY 40 can be considered during the morning and evening rush hours.\n\nIn closing, I believe there are a number of options available to safely cross the Rochester \/ Rochester suburb line through the intersection of NY 37, NY 788 and West Main Street. A tunnel for NY 37 on a dedicated stretch of roadway is the most logical and easiest option but there are no dedicated lanes of traffic where the crossing is located. When traffic congestion creates the lack of space to construct the proposed Rochester bypass, a road approach would be appropriate. The US 40\/NY 37 intersection has always been considered the bottleneck where the crossing is located and this time around, it seems the Rochester line is the worst offender. While these problems are common to many corridors, it is unfortunate that they continue to exist at this particular location.","token_len":348,"entropy":[3.8044,9.9216,0.8186,2.6484,7.6254,4.5611,9.6822,10.789,6.5362,10.327,4.3663,9.1734,7.6107,9.9936,3.1286,2.6121,4.1011,9.9803,2.1878,10.6718,0.5224,6.8001,9.3813,5.5019,1.9657,1.7803,7.2486,7.0682,6.3701,0.5493,3.9709,9.5117,0.4657,2.6106,0.7208,1.59,1.5692,1.509,2.0294,0.7431,5.4293,0.5962,1.5135,1.0381,1.6297,2.685,4.377,2.8612,2.7932,0.8424,1.2268,2.7401,0.011,0.3809,0.8289,2.4466,6.3067,2.7452,1.4976,1.0045,1.0285,0.0295,0.0362,0.1506,1.5859,6.0875,0.7263,0.9161,2.8506,0.003,0.3806,0.5101,0.3727,1.2449,0.7198,2.4124,1.8545,0.5477,1.2565,0.0172,0.0502,0.1541,5.8682,0.6534,1.8112,0.7174,4.6055,1.9363,0.0704,0.4252,3.9876,2.0487,0.8388,2.9417,4.2698,0.8848,5.8851,2.61,1.2862,4.3731,1.323,1.4418,0.4681,1.6577,1.7182,1.1454,0.2679,0.0122,0.0028,0.0826,4.8782,0.2083,3.361,0.2116,1.7962,0.2235,0.0343,1.2468,4.6043,2.7295,3.1765,4.508,0.5703,4.8946,3.1801,2.5468,0.3526,2.2317,1.2667,0.2735,0.76,0.0015,0.1446,0.3739,0.621,0.9224,0.1907,0.4575,0.0084,0.0256,0.0198,0.0636,2.7772,0.011,5.7046,3.909,1.0227,2.3027,0.038,1.3693,1.7821,1.3618,5.3621,5.628,2.0571,0.6101,5.0297,4.4475,2.3151,1.0472,4.2098,0.6694,2.1869,2.2183,0.5896,5.6421,1.3389,5.7047,1.0749,4.7647,0.1414,0.3169,0.6278,3.4756,5.9195,1.5995,3.4617,0.5762,6.2049,5.2589,4.2988,3.7194,0.0345,1.1605,2.2171,4.4037,0.8811,0.9884,4.1407,5.5166,0.4762,4.8851,6.1693,1.5182,2.9648,2.0322,0.687,0.3626,0.6783,0.6533,1.3773,0.0002,3.9397,4.766,0.101,1.1206,4.3433,2.9572,0.7326,1.7196,0.8025,0.0034,1.2085,3.1055,0.4961,5.3039,1.4859,0.2613,2.0473,5.4231,2.8681,4.8555,0.2564,5.5012,1.2322,4.7594,0.4086,0.7703,1.8731,2.2181,0.2308,5.6452,5.0607,0.9498,4.4404,0.0762,0.0847,0.2937,4.2022,5.5655,5.1892,2.5882,0.4469,5.9431,3.6765,4.1617,6.3812,0.2002,2.4652,1.5823,2.3211,0.7501,2.2571,2.2479,3.6993,1.1142,4.6297,2.7951,0.3359,4.3626,4.5486,1.6396,2.9823,1.3963,6.2774,1.2405,3.0991,0.6305,0.3309,0.2396,6.1442,3.8968,3.8152,6.0187,2.6108,7.1116,0.004,2.3963,1.5636,3.6569,2.722,4.6801,6.5702,1.4447,0.5607,1.562,4.4945,3.9736,1.9357,0.4205,4.9991,0.4495,2.3765,4.0887,3.7615,0.9516,0.196,1.6485,2.6653,2.5353,4.9272,0.2276,2.3559,2.5343,4.158,5.0214,1.4778,3.2754,0.7659,0.103,1.911,3.1729,5.6922,1.3538,1.0813,1.7073,2.6156,2.2134,3.097,4.7975,1.5381,3.0501,5.3699,1.2764,0.4412,4.5299,5.0164,5.0299,1.1902,5.0321,1.3519,1.9804,4.8935,0.8091,1.9597,0.6733,3.3066,0.5128,2.3625,2.4303,0.2466,1.4466,2.9631,1.3521,3.2884,0.6234,0.3269]}

{"id":1486,"ended":true,"length":334,"gen_text":"In the early seventies, the capabilities of AI programs were limited. Even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve ; all the programs were capable of was finding the shortest possible way to walk to the end of a line, for example.\n\nThings got much better in the 1980s. AI programs could write programs capable of handling a lot of tasks at once, with powerful data structures that acted as a kind of black box. IBM's Watson computer beat humans at Jeopardy! and could guess where objects were located on a map. The IBM PC, introduced in 1981, could simulate a person with the use of multiple processors.\n\nToday, we know that AI systems are able to perform tasks that our brain is not capable of\u2014it's called general intelligence. And they know what to do more precisely than we do. For example, Google's AI system DeepMind (created by a Google-funded PhD from Oxford University and led by Geoffrey Hinton) beat the world's best Go player, Lee Sedol, at the board game in 2014. It also figured out solutions to problems that humans hadn't thought of and figured out complex questions from images on a set of 3D shapes.\n\nWe are still far from full-blown artificial general intelligence where a computer decides for itself all issues related to ethics and rights. Still, the way AI machines handle seemingly simple problems raises questions about just how far the human brain can go. Just as artificial intelligence machines today could be used in a wide variety of situations, that's true about our own past. The way we handle complexity in our brains will only become more complicated as we progress.\n\nThis article was originally published by The Conversation.

{"id":4324,"ended":true,"length":339,"gen_text":"Civil War store cards differ from patriotic tokens in that one or both sides displays the name and \/ or location of a privately owned business. Businesses that could afford it had two custom card designs: one that featured the business's name and location (like the front plate for a postmarked United States postal stamp) and one that featured the business's name only in the top line (like the front plate for an ordinary postmarked United States postage stamp). [ 5 ] During the civil war the United States government used a wide variety of store cards to advertise various government activities and services. The cards featured the following: The United States flag The nation's colors The name of the city or town the service is performed for The name of a representative named by Congress. If a representative was unavailable, state representatives were used or President George Washington, if he was still alive. Sometimes the representatives could also represent military units like the Union army, Federal navy, or Navy, or the Confederate army. The card also displayed the approximate number of people employed at the business. This number showed how many customers the business served during the Civil War. A soldier might have 2,000 employees serving him or her. A store might not have enough employees to serve 3,000 soldiers, but 2,000 (or more) would be a better number for business' financial success.The cards also displayed the approximate number of employees the business had then, and the current number. Sometimes the cards included the specific type and quantity of military supplies that the business held. This information was crucial in gauging the importance of the businesses to American forces fighting the war.The United States Postal Service introduced a new stamp in April 1865, marking the start of the U.S. post-WWII service using private company store cards.","token_len":358,"entropy":[0.9172,11.9216,8.1733,9.7319,0.4765,12.0493,4.9724,0.8475,0.3886,6.3958,4.9678,1.4065,1.1967,8.8093,1.2493,3.2601,2.5125,8.6446,0.1502,4.1392,0.0668,2.6253,9.3474,0.3647,2.4152,0.9263,7.2709,0.5939,2.0997,5.0645,4.7387,2.6512,3.3578,6.2405,7.081,4.3467,2.3853,2.1985,1.2354,2.8392,2.3367,0.8262,2.7795,1.7684,0.352,0.7632,1.4332,2.8508,3.5678,0.9636,5.7715,6.1146,2.5512,1.0616,3.858,7.3286,3.7449,0.0213,3.116,2.0459,1.026,0.0871,0.8675,0.2666,0.8539,0.5602,0.4676,0.3877,1.0831,3.2052,4.4346,1.3878,3.4957,3.9898,0.82,0.2614,0.362,1.6348,0.1885,0.279,2.9361,4.4547,0.9294,1.0531,0.6717,0.0021,2.8284,0.0054,0.1005,5.4084,6.9219,0.1416,4.9635,0.1533,3.8544,0.0521,3.4438,1.833,0.0055,1.3946,3.3995,2.106,3.6569,0.28,0.0045,2.9032,0.4077,1.2585,2.9304,2.8967,2.5035,2.0205,1.7389,2.2789,0.4151,1.9669,1.5944,3.3806,1.4577,3.8235,1.9481,2.4436,2.2088,0.003,2.24,2.7957,5.5438,0.0893,3.7181,0.7093,3.2628,0.4194,0.4758,2.9591,1.0431,0.3928,3.0918,3.5582,1.6084,1.6092,1.9942,1.1784,1.3292,0.2469,2.1445,5.2712,5.8464,2.237,0.6253,4.2444,5.3019,1.9416,1.9269,0.711,5.3431,0.4052,7.4075,1.9926,0.4163,1.4614,5.1831,6.1529,3.5401,0.0527,3.2661,3.1188,1.5094,0.2969,3.0739,0.2526,0.6049,5.7466,0.9674,6.2123,3.8677,2.6348,3.3639,5.6088,0.9112,4.3568,0.2514,2.9754,1.8773,1.5683,4.2656,4.0819,0.4157,0.6179,5.926,2.8821,0.8291,1.8461,2.0828,0.5682,0.333,1.44,2.6315,2.035,2.5146,0.6401,5.4788,1.7846,0.0229,3.0263,1.6737,1.4275,0.2482,1.0983,0.883,3.6895,1.2438,6.1923,1.1996,0.3782,5.4724,1.2227,0.3196,1.8289,3.102,0.5605,3.8143,0.0304,0.396,3.6596,5.8152,3.7177,2.0172,5.6932,0.6755,0.2896,2.6975,3.9743,1.1842,1.9959,0.2066,1.6001,2.526,2.7983,2.3578,4.4975,0.8627,3.2247,0.5307,0.2901,1.1907,5.0925,0.0486,0.0565,3.5291,1.3845,0.9287,4.2954,0.0107,0.0711,5.6455,1.0112,1.6359,0.094,1.1451,1.0686,2.2727,2.946,1.6664,2.3949,4.2477,5.8414,3.4702,2.5027,0.2455,4.077,2.2773,1.4026,0.6033,0.287,0.3565,0.6131,0.003,2.9472,2.2774,0.241,0.9694,7.065,1.5032,0.9331,1.0774,4.147,0.3796,2.0427,4.2579,0.67,1.97,3.5043,1.5342,6.1591,4.0108,3.8784,3.7889,0.0245,4.6559,1.4307,2.2919,0.9239,0.4282,5.5817,0.7532,2.8287,1.0807,0.8643,5.1326,1.8506,3.6909,0.0,0.4781,3.8405,0.1916,0.58,5.2896,1.1659,6.3916,3.5619,3.7695,0.9406,0.6766,0.1719,2.1535,2.0491,0.004,2.1816,0.0197,4.0491,1.3044,1.5414,3.4072,1.2257,3.4213,3.1432,1.7305,5.1131,0.0976,2.2627,0.0038,0.6772,3.5381,0.0022,0.0141,0.0194,1.6459,0.8352,4.1188,0.9966,5.8819,6.4957,5.7768,4.207,1.5156,0.0955,0.3602]}
{"id":302,"ended":false,"length":357,"gen_text":"The Catechism states : `` Human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the creative action of God and it remains forever in a special relationship with the Creator, who is its final aim and end. This relationship is created by the natural law and is to be maintained because of its intrinsic value.' The Christian should never kill the baby for any reason, whether it is a sin or not. ``If there is a dispute over the life of [a victim], [the Christian] may choose not to intervene, and the parents may have recourse to civil law if they themselves find it difficult to persuade their neighbor to have recourse to civil law,'' the Catechism continues. To abort is to kill a human being. Death is final since Christ is our life ; one's own will must precede one's death. This is what a Christian ought to do in any case. But it is wrong to murder anyone whether an ordinary citizen can sue, or the parents cannot pay. It is wrong to shoot someone, even to defend one's self and the life of a second person ; it is also wrong to kill a victim because the killer does not want any of the money. A churchman is not allowed to break a law that is not against his conscience, although he cannot help it. But a Christian is responsible to serve the greater Good, which is also the public interest, because only by doing so can he do his duty properly. Some Christians are trying to prove God's existence. Their arguments are very complex and they often contradict one another. When a believer attempts to reason about any subject of human activity, even if it were controversial and extremely complex, he must ask oneself: \"Who will interpret my doubts?\" Inevitably, the answer is: \"No one.\"","token_len":358,"entropy":[6.7578,4.6569,0.0172,4.2374,6.766,9.0915,10.2668,1.2515,0.8466,0.2477,3.0745,4.5955,0.374,1.0269,0.5139,4.671,0.9544,4.5211,1.4036,0.0439,0.2997,2.9869,4.3137,5.4478,4.6375,1.9706,1.0739,4.352,0.2954,0.5759,1.8893,0.5763,2.1241,1.2076,1.2919,0.9204,3.4518,5.265,0.9841,1.106,0.4288,2.9181,0.501,0.9485,4.8611,1.1082,1.0342,5.7675,0.6144,1.5624,1.3438,4.3042,0.093,4.2994,5.6664,1.39,0.9578,1.3219,0.7403,6.4298,3.309,4.9445,4.0706,3.5457,3.0593,3.7865,4.393,3.3856,1.2385,0.0956,1.4918,3.4937,1.6395,0.6546,1.8099,4.4764,0.243,0.129,0.496,4.4577,3.923,3.1797,0.2198,1.2757,4.0601,2.7213,0.694,2.662,0.2996,9.7188,0.919,5.2501,0.8181,4.2558,0.4046,1.6592,0.331,3.8088,3.8713,2.5766,0.0133,2.2539,1.4571,2.7626,2.28,2.9209,1.2226,3.6995,1.0694,0.1118,1.7493,1.265,2.651,0.6663,6.5305,4.5556,1.0093,1.5318,0.1561,4.5221,1.781,4.3276,0.6545,4.6301,0.8922,0.0264,1.2679,0.0894,5.5153,0.7714,0.0872,0.0014,0.0011,2.3557,0.0857,5.6448,5.2942,2.5654,0.551,2.1745,1.3405,0.5244,0.3501,1.172,6.0287,0.6131,6.3151,7.2661,4.2251,2.1498,3.5948,2.7022,7.3057,4.6434,2.8417,1.8035,4.7131,2.9597,3.2926,0.0,1.7764,0.0118,1.7232,0.5322,3.7365,0.9094,3.2996,4.589,1.8712,3.662,0.0438,0.3834,2.1056,2.0839,1.208,1.3012,3.8459,2.8102,0.4223,3.7655,0.3477,4.8863,3.701,6.1807,4.9835,6.3982,2.539,7.0843,4.6573,2.3967,0.2853,2.7725,3.1803,1.825,5.222,1.2765,2.877,0.1309,1.4086,0.375,5.9283,2.2167,3.1282,1.3492,3.7511,2.4707,1.874,0.0167,2.3838,3.7033,1.9791,1.4278,0.0275,1.9907,5.4385,0.2264,4.8498,1.5686,0.0555,2.2633,0.1081,0.0681,1.6218,1.4756,4.6863,3.0943,2.0325,3.0118,2.8079,0.0095,1.231,5.6433,3.6098,0.6363,1.1486,1.4547,3.4375,6.0359,3.6612,2.4551,1.1034,1.7314,0.0376,5.715,2.3187,1.4815,2.7612,1.247,1.3522,1.8145,2.1814,0.1819,1.5536,4.7518,1.0134,3.5383,3.9645,1.4896,0.8277,3.2749,2.508,1.6099,1.147,5.245,1.8478,7.0219,1.5241,5.408,4.0328,1.5622,1.9694,0.7031,4.8747,1.3747,5.9775,3.4323,1.4506,3.75,4.5188,3.0224,1.28,0.4893,0.4368,1.3148,4.1656,1.9651,0.5495,4.4535,0.485,5.6942,2.5774,2.3727,5.4907,0.0347,5.001,5.6703,0.5337,0.3937,2.9527,4.5514,2.4078,0.5689,3.7663,3.7944,0.9509,2.6387,3.3695,2.654,1.8069,0.0136,0.3572,5.1321,2.57,3.8905,4.4572,0.0472,5.87,2.6598,5.3184,2.3356,3.2436,2.6841,4.1316,0.346,5.0651,1.4839,1.0813,5.4317,5.7826,2.8348,5.8318,2.0593,0.0708,0.4254,1.3381,4.7076,5.2245,1.469,2.4958,3.3869,3.2283,4.4861,1.1913,5.4144,1.2159,3.2564,5.3501,0.0277,0.4339,1.5708,1.8355,1.4432,2.1558,0.7841,2.4135,0.0879,0.676]}

Despite being suspended by the platform in June 2011, some Internet users used an account created for the singer to post some anti-social behavior, including \"swearing, photos of anorexia and an image taken from a photo shoot Cyrus did during the height of her Miley Cyrus' public relations meltdown in 2009.\"\n\nWhile Disney was spending roughly $200 million to promote its film, Twitter was building out a $100 million advertising program for Gravity, based on the popularity of the film's star Natalie Portman playing two different female astronauts orbiting around each other.\n\nThe Internet company spent just over $500,000 to promote Gravity.\n\nEven though Twitter could have spent far more in marketing, it could never match Disney's marketing budget.\n\nWhat will happen with this news?

The company will only say the service is \"currently on trial.\"","token_len":358,"entropy":[1.787,4.542,6.9514,10.2576,0.1547,2.2488,2.4904,5.7631,0.429,6.3377,8.1677,2.7631,1.695,1.7587,3.5377,1.4381,4.5647,2.2631,12.0574,0.024,0.1233,2.5902,2.1419,3.9328,0.7256,2.7279,2.9002,8.5392,13.9492,8.1184,8.316,8.147,1.8241,1.7724,5.3588,11.5622,0.2349,0.1669,4.9638,3.041,5.1639,0.4259,4.733,0.3268,1.6174,1.3716,1.3713,4.9074,0.7881,0.0392,1.7801,4.3258,3.2889,1.389,3.8129,1.0151,2.1599,2.6324,0.0445,0.1423,4.6026,2.7031,1.2486,0.0429,0.2365,0.3794,0.8091,0.0053,7.0325,4.8474,2.7511,4.0279,3.6987,4.7296,5.0279,0.1905,0.0087,0.2395,4.8421,0.1936,4.3224,0.0097,0.1958,1.3255,2.8241,0.4597,0.4129,1.1902,0.0002,3.3648,4.7046,2.7495,3.4399,0.6487,5.2572,3.6345,0.0028,0.0785,2.846,0.1035,0.6218,0.8507,1.5838,2.5076,1.0026,5.0724,0.1009,3.2253,4.5076,0.7619,1.3571,0.0002,1.8242,5.9198,6.5395,3.3231,1.9221,2.4281,0.1928,0.1169,0.1379,0.0008,0.0042,0.0148,0.0098,0.0513,0.042,0.0772,0.1201,0.199,0.0722,0.0013,0.0074,0.0019,0.2049,6.6708,1.6703,3.196,2.8985,0.0046,3.7979,1.1542,4.0388,4.7298,4.2654,2.0165,0.1898,5.5249,1.1379,1.6084,4.7021,1.4314,4.9979,2.0473,5.0996,3.7277,0.1258,5.5766,4.0014,1.0132,5.0613,0.1037,0.1074,0.7965,5.4368,2.1829,1.4344,2.287,1.9324,1.634,1.0454,6.6869,2.5131,5.4892,1.9239,2.4252,1.7327,3.2517,2.6195,2.8,0.5103,6.3605,6.2193,0.339,4.5049,4.5744,3.8884,2.8903,1.6449,1.6506,1.8906,0.6981,1.1131,4.7433,4.2574,0.0156,3.3117,3.1337,1.3862,0.8235,4.1529,5.4408,0.5577,3.2771,5.2361,0.1971,5.2986,3.3588,1.0889,1.6129,3.5023,1.8221,6.9565,0.6772,1.0964,3.4218,0.6878,3.2716,1.3266,5.7679,1.3042,2.3892,0.0048,0.0793,3.7645,0.0139,0.1036,2.8195,6.1906,4.043,3.0638,1.9996,2.2595,0.4982,0.5858,0.0002,3.9531,2.3267,2.6308,4.5785,5.9817,0.1131,0.4277,0.0168,1.7069,0.7648,2.2627,1.2908,0.2486,1.5467,0.6656,6.1468,2.4615,1.7681,3.3319,2.3068,0.0529,1.2532,2.5924,1.5638,5.7784,1.1518,3.7094,0.1176,1.631,5.6923,0.0428,0.7531,1.0384,1.5395,3.7237,5.4399,0.0031,0.0,8.3713,6.1877,2.2838,3.1678,1.9546,6.6428,3.1397,1.7797,0.0031,0.4526,0.9519,0.0002,2.1751,3.1242,0.3161,4.3228,4.5535,1.6161,0.1716,4.2442,0.5076,0.0066,2.033,0.6088,1.3553,1.9413,1.1287,0.0002,5.4628,1.2958,1.622,5.2523,1.9224,2.2764,2.9556,0.4233,4.3983,1.063,1.3631,1.2289,4.6984,4.0206,2.5764,2.4614,0.1553,1.4945,0.996,0.5098,1.1071,0.0002,4.9742,4.1267,1.743,1.93,3.7078,4.319,0.3607,3.1583,3.131,2.0491,2.9726,1.0965,3.8384,4.2107,1.2964,0.0798,3.9865,0.0769,0.0449,0.9643,3.3758,0.5186,2.9034,2.271,1.0067,3.8197,5.8798,1.596,0.8476,3.656,5.6136,2.8838,1.1953]}

Varina High won, but he lost four fumbles and lost his first game. He suffered a broken finger in the first game and missed four more games, and that season he averaged 6.0 yards per carry, behind his older brother. On the other hand, he was named the District 3 Player of the Year.\n\nHe also gained 1,150 yards on the ground, which led to his being named the Michigan 5A Newcomer of the Year in 2008. But he broke his left leg in the first game of his junior year during the 2009 season and later had surgery on the broken left fibula and an ankle injury. By the time he had fully recovered he was ineligible for the 2009 season.\n\nAfter that Varina moved on to the Ann Arbor City League for four years, where he averaged 3.8 yards per carry and had 3,360 rushing yards.

{"id":824,"ended":true,"length":355,"gen_text":"On 6 December 2007, it was reported that Clarion Solicitors, representing Gordon Park, said that they would launch an appeal. In a public statement, they said : The appeal is not intended as an admission of guilt or to seek to overturn the judgment of the courts; rather it is designed to provide for a period of time when the judgment may be revised in the light of new information or evidence which is subsequently brought to light.\" On 7 December 2007, it was reported that Gordon Park agreed to meet all three judges, and that he would have 30 minutes to offer a defence to the charge. He made further statement to the court : The matter with the prosecution is not one in which the legal profession would ordinarily take part but for the way in which the court was approached. A decision will be made on Friday or Saturday by the court's judge, who has asked me to consider his case and advise him on any advice I feel appropriate, but it would appear to me that it would be inappropriate for me to speak to him to that effect. We have now taken over responsibility for the criminal case of the other three. We have agreed to meet the judges in London, in which Mr Blair will be representing Gordon Park and David Irvine, who is representing the Lord Justice Leveson inquiry. He will have 30 minutes to offer a defence. His evidence will be in the form of a written statement. He may then spend five minutes further to put his case. My position is that I cannot assist him in those stages. He will then have 30 minutes in which to put his position. If he is successful, then that case will now be passed to the Crown Prosecution Service, which must make an application to the judge to give it priority and to the High Court for a retrial.","token_len":360,"entropy":[8.1677,2.8872,4.7711,0.2973,4.6293,0.2569,0.953,0.1565,11.5436,1.5973,11.049,0.2108,0.0079,1.9928,3.3466,8.1385,8.4223,1.26,5.3183,1.3503,2.7709,1.7722,5.8849,1.532,0.7071,2.5923,3.4102,1.7296,5.8692,0.2603,0.7911,1.7047,0.4423,6.9446,5.2197,3.192,1.6405,2.2997,2.5946,2.5073,1.2293,2.4219,0.2718,0.7887,2.1692,3.0093,2.6705,2.0005,3.7692,0.362,3.1112,0.9902,0.1202,4.9845,4.0878,0.9939,0.8468,0.1711,3.3942,0.0777,3.3303,3.9242,1.5341,4.8108,0.1124,1.2608,2.4859,1.0237,4.6209,2.7118,0.1369,4.7028,2.3671,1.1729,1.0804,0.0031,1.1338,1.7211,1.8953,1.1966,2.575,2.8091,3.185,1.7684,0.1185,0.1883,2.2848,3.4242,2.6795,0.141,0.1194,0.1534,1.5451,0.0351,0.2436,0.1171,2.1944,0.0276,5.9386,0.1577,4.751,5.5297,4.4397,2.4378,3.1248,2.0687,2.1064,1.5685,0.7028,4.4222,6.0944,0.845,0.6175,5.2206,2.142,1.6936,2.5704,0.2828,1.9368,0.9825,2.1357,4.03,4.5123,2.5482,1.3197,0.2996,1.4613,3.0921,3.3878,4.748,5.6811,1.8733,3.6453,1.2329,2.0782,2.6737,2.4074,0.0227,2.9894,5.1824,1.712,3.2688,3.5078,2.8331,2.4075,3.9375,4.0833,0.3954,6.0091,0.4408,0.0024,1.0844,4.7817,3.5562,2.6279,0.983,4.8014,4.239,5.8931,0.3899,0.8049,1.8154,5.5001,3.7077,0.633,4.1351,0.4983,2.5485,3.1997,3.5272,1.598,2.3304,2.0706,3.1613,0.7992,0.15,4.5946,3.3587,2.9544,1.5606,3.5179,0.474,1.2642,3.3296,5.0706,1.6479,4.0875,2.094,3.6259,2.602,2.6431,3.036,3.507,1.1498,0.1837,0.2571,2.6847,1.0382,0.1791,2.2652,0.2585,0.5645,0.052,4.2299,1.3732,2.1898,5.6319,3.3963,0.9117,0.4952,4.7872,1.3759,4.0074,4.1602,3.8061,4.4536,0.103,0.621,4.5068,1.6653,4.2735,1.8307,5.3229,2.2562,4.0001,1.9546,1.3979,3.9749,0.987,2.3545,1.1073,1.9101,3.1122,3.5235,2.3441,3.59,4.8813,5.163,6.2142,0.9996,0.8609,5.0291,3.2353,0.0405,1.9088,4.8743,6.4669,1.6973,2.1252,0.9635,0.9631,1.8543,4.9035,3.9869,0.5657,0.0011,0.0,1.4933,0.6359,3.5662,0.8254,1.6417,0.6598,0.0099,0.3404,1.2901,0.3178,0.0313,1.827,4.8882,4.2044,0.4442,0.3435,2.7052,1.3481,0.3256,0.0175,0.6081,0.9307,0.7174,1.2362,2.2455,3.9823,3.6991,5.6139,4.5138,0.5134,4.8021,1.8941,4.8424,1.5623,0.9085,1.1077,4.7527,3.6458,0.6838,0.4297,1.0568,3.4451,4.637,1.3867,0.8197,4.5977,5.1304,0.7565,2.5173,0.9216,1.2791,0.5089,1.7955,0.0219,3.1597,0.3198,0.1726,0.4831,0.2533,3.5522,0.7092,2.8264,0.8013,2.0576,2.2012,0.5606,1.8146,3.9431,4.5353,0.4121,4.9747,0.5849,4.6136,0.517,0.3628,3.1442,0.4427,0.0004,0.0069,1.7635,1.517,4.4142,3.2397,3.0548,0.8832,0.4941,0.2162,2.217,1.452,4.4938,2.0447,2.163,2.964,1.8436,4.4103,3.8136,0.0026,1.8794,1.0214,4.2086,0.0011,0.2359]}

{"id":626,"ended":false,"length":300,"gen_text":"Diamandis went on her first headlining tour to promote the album, performing in Europe, North America and Australia. Dates included the Glastonbury Festival 2010, South by Southwest and the Falls Festival in Ireland. The tour ended with the band's first sold out show at the Sydney Opera House in June 2010. In November 2010, Diamandis opened for Lady Gaga in the U.S. before the tour's finale in New York City on December 1, 2010.\n\nDiamandis received a lifetime achievement Grammy, and the band's fourth album, SuperCollider, was named Album of the Year for New Zealand radio. The LP debuted with two Grammy wins: one for Entertainer and the other for Song of the Year for \"SuperCollider.\" She was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Female Vocalist.\n\nWith more shows being announced in the upcoming month, her live show dates have also been announced, starting March 9 in the Bay Area and continuing through April 7. Diamandis and the band are currently working on a new live album, so some of the shows won't be part of the live shows.

{"id":3895,"ended":true,"length":321,"gen_text":"Copper sharks attack humans infrequently, but the species places sixth in the number of unprovoked attacks on people. During the tracking period through 2013, the University of Florida attributed 20 attacks to \"human distraction,\" that are the result of sharks attacking swimmers while they're swimming away because of other animals in the water. That sounds like it has a higher-than-average likelihood of producing attacks, since humans are always in the water when these attacks occur. [ 5 Real-Life Terrifying Shark Attacks ]\n\nIt is a fairly high-risk activity, so people should take extra care, such as keeping their head above the water and swimming slowly with arms outstretched. If you're a shark, I hope you know that you are in no danger. If you're not a shark, you should know that your actions do not make you a victim.\n\nA good rule of thumb is that sharks won't use force to defend themselves. There are far more predators, such as big cats and humans, out there, and there's a very big difference between a single attacker and a herd of attackers. People who think they've found a shark are in danger of getting carried away by their curiosity and should not try to capture a shark, as it does not do your life any good.\n\nYou can learn more about what the University of Florida has to say about the copper shark at the University of Florida's website.\n\nFollow Jonah Bennett on Twitter\n\nSend your shark-related questions to kevin@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

These approaches allow additional discussion of treatment options and provide opportunities to arrive at well @ -planned treatments.\n\nWe need to put treatment and support planning at the front of our plans so that when we talk with cancer providers, we have options.\n\n5. We can save a lot of money on other drugs with similar benefits\n\nAnother reason for cost savings shouldered by our health care system is our lack of understanding and acceptance of newer anti - cancer drugs. Because of these drugs, we're now seeing substantial drops in mortality. Drugs like Avastin, Herceptin and Keytruda have been around for decades and are proven to extend life, with reduced risks of cancer recurrence and mortality.\n\nThese drugs are also a large reason why overall cancer mortality has dropped in the US from nearly 6% in 1995 to around 5% in 2006.\n\n6. We can save money on other cancers, too\n\nWe currently have the highest rate of treatment-related deaths during the second half of life vs. any other age group in the US. Our rates of cancer deaths during the third and fourth decades of life are also highest among women.\n\nThe most common cancers we treat are esophageal cancer, leukemia, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer. These cancers are known to be caused by hereditary factors. Treating these conditions can drastically increase survival rates versus treatments we currently use on these cancers.\n\nWe need to do better. We live as long, enjoy more leisure time and even enjoy better health during middle age vs. young adulthood.

{"id":2754,"ended":true,"length":345,"gen_text":"After 1978, a number of astronomers kept up the search for Lowell's Planet X, convinced that, because Pluto was no longer a viable candidate, an unseen tenth planet must have been involved in Pluto's collapse. The first group of astronomers to make this case were Walter Babbitt and George Halter in 1982 and 1983.\n\nThe case in favor of Planet X as the major culprit in Pluto's demise was strengthened in 2000 when the discovery of the so-called Planet Nine - a small yet highly irregular body approximately ten times less massive than Jupiter. This object seems to exist in the outer solar system, and has been likened to a rogue planet or asteroid who wandered into the Kuiper Belt, or between objects that form the outer limits of our solar system. The object's orbit may be more elliptical than usual, a possibility that could explain its distance from Pluto and other known Kuiper Belt objects (such as Eris, Makemake and Haumea).\n\nIn late 2012, astronomers detected an object using the HARPS-North telescope at the European Southern Observatory. They found it to be a very young, very bright planet, moving very quickly away from the sun towards the constellation of Bootes. This suggested that Planet X had been orbiting Pluto very recently, possibly within the last 40 to 50 million years.\n\nThe discovery was so unexpected that astronomers immediately started looking for other Planet X companions. At first, there was no sign of any other large planet orbiting distant solar system stars. But at a workshop in 2013, a group of astronomers working with the European Space Agency concluded that these objects were indeed Planet X.\n\nIn April 2018, when the New Horizons mission reaches Pluto, it will have a very close encounter with Planet X, so their observations will help define whether Planet X is the culprit or not.","token_len":370,"entropy":[11.1593,0.3394,3.8788,2.9345,0.0037,8.9532,8.2361,4.0007,1.0274,2.1105,0.5243,11.949,0.5708,3.9212,1.1163,1.0851,6.8738,0.4825,4.9929,5.1487,6.7576,1.0049,4.3055,0.0385,1.4651,5.1573,1.1669,0.405,4.7149,4.4641,7.0142,0.1156,1.9458,2.2968,1.0802,4.4214,1.667,3.8571,0.0159,5.5832,0.4552,2.5063,3.4714,5.6596,1.2765,0.8955,0.8016,2.3501,1.0721,2.0312,2.3044,5.9032,4.2763,3.0797,0.0027,0.9068,3.9016,5.1028,3.6034,1.0789,3.5882,2.2934,1.2673,0.7099,3.0056,0.002,2.0486,4.7931,6.1776,0.5016,0.0235,1.0966,0.0051,4.0903,0.5099,6.4667,2.403,0.9166,0.773,0.0053,0.6294,0.7599,1.9654,1.3442,4.5106,0.8682,1.8874,2.3218,0.0647,1.9095,3.4592,0.0107,0.003,2.0109,0.4236,6.0585,0.4569,2.886,6.8803,4.0311,4.9782,1.6091,4.6723,3.0011,0.051,5.2391,0.0135,0.0172,3.9346,3.4184,2.3248,0.9713,5.0391,0.0808,5.0346,1.1341,0.8838,1.2642,0.9664,0.0065,0.7899,1.6042,2.5806,0.5935,4.9081,0.0784,0.5385,4.141,0.1688,3.0974,2.561,6.7717,4.1051,1.093,0.5329,1.0151,0.0,0.0,0.2694,1.9124,3.9714,4.0218,9.4943,2.2655,3.3004,0.2199,0.8745,4.4075,0.0118,1.2272,0.0723,0.0007,0.2185,2.3621,2.939,1.7449,1.0816,4.2854,0.7996,4.1687,1.16,0.0024,0.1499,4.9914,0.3612,5.1399,3.4312,0.341,2.048,1.3261,1.6531,5.0281,0.1235,1.1687,1.9124,3.1879,2.8469,0.6221,0.0105,0.0001,0.0406,0.333,3.8994,3.4861,0.0089,1.3259,0.0009,1.4511,1.6545,0.006,1.3024,0.6455,0.0016,0.0,0.4664,0.7271,0.0003,2.2049,5.1273,2.9263,0.1291,2.3908,3.6907,2.2043,1.8338,6.0209,0.1984,2.7087,0.0002,1.7192,0.0663,0.8695,1.9497,0.7274,0.9416,0.004,0.0006,1.9743,3.451,3.3249,1.9252,0.9736,0.091,1.0544,3.5896,2.3529,1.0872,2.2505,2.4273,3.0926,1.1241,4.951,2.2465,1.2818,2.9771,0.0234,0.6656,1.1758,5.733,0.4102,0.5171,1.2816,4.325,0.0004,0.5302,1.9202,5.1666,0.4382,1.3359,0.3728,2.2431,1.8212,4.8325,1.3669,4.9639,0.3482,0.7624,2.7071,2.4049,0.3658,0.3013,5.2974,3.3665,1.0663,1.0779,0.0033,0.2123,0.9308,0.0002,2.1989,1.9556,2.0838,3.4067,1.7746,0.1907,2.6216,2.8484,2.2422,1.9341,0.1697,1.4776,4.2085,0.0186,8.0777,0.9041,4.8936,0.7301,0.3319,3.5084,1.3075,1.0285,1.6496,0.2641,0.7004,0.8987,3.6737,3.2546,3.5875,5.3093,3.0893,1.7837,1.55,0.6098,1.5263,5.1171,1.7058,4.3604,1.14,2.4535,0.1895,2.2096,0.7637,0.078,0.6628,2.7794,1.341,0.8169,2.6821,2.0299,0.0501,5.0492,0.0441,4.8558,1.2634,1.4508,2.7275,1.1694,0.0217,1.0388,1.1315,0.0002,2.1808,3.4974,4.9538,0.0541,5.493,0.9089,3.2501,0.0102,2.0955,3.1985,0.6169,0.4183,0.782,0.2142,2.1956,1.6625,3.4552,1.0277,0.5453,0.0346,1.9056,0.055,1.1607,3.8587,6.4137,2.7622,0.56,2.4758,5.8051,1.7956,1.5024,0.0043,0.6941,2.7453,1.9103,1.4027,0.3937,0.1347]}
{"id":4560,"ended":false,"length":326,"gen_text":"Starting in 1870, flags were created for the Japanese Emperor ( then Emperor Meiji ), the Empress, and for other members of the imperial family. At first, the Emperor's flag was black with a white-red fringe. The first Japanese flag of the Emperor ( Emp. Meiji ) was a white flag with a white fringe, and the first Empress's flag was a yellow flag with a red fringe. During the Meiji Revolution, Empress Meiji's flag and the Emperor's flag were changed, and the Emperor's flag became a black flag with a white-red fringe. But these flags were eventually replaced by the red-white (tricolor) standard of the Japanese Imperial Army, adopted on May 11, 1945.\n\nBy 1945, the Japanese state had been replaced by the Imperial Army, with the Emperor still holding the title of Imperial Consort and continuing to live in the Imperial Palace (now known as the Imperial Palace Hotel). Also, the flag became the \" Imperial White Flag \" and consisted of a dark blue background with a white-red-yellow-blue-red tricolor. It was issued for use by the Imperial Army and other units.\n\nUntil 1947, the Japanese flag was used for the Japanese military, but there were no official laws stating where the flags flew. During the Korean war, the Republic of Korea adopted the red-white flag as their own standard, while their enemies, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China were still using the Japanese Imperial flag (the two Republics were still at war as late as 1949).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nMore Images\n\n\nRelated pages about Japanese Flags\n\nLinks to related pages, including pages about the Red Ensign\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2001 - 2018, by Frank Perry, www.perry.info","token_len":370,"entropy":[2.8364,8.5165,0.2353,12.659,1.0842,4.9572,1.7828,1.6743,7.6359,4.108,2.6895,11.251,3.0706,1.2878,0.0013,1.8546,0.7687,2.6398,2.675,0.8541,2.4453,3.0406,2.9571,0.0122,0.0946,2.182,0.0388,0.384,4.7751,2.0563,0.4482,1.1482,2.9534,0.9069,0.9549,0.4498,3.8598,0.9439,0.6203,0.903,4.7684,3.0277,3.9452,1.0107,1.8887,3.5536,2.8041,0.6384,3.4259,0.7634,2.4207,2.7976,6.1479,1.3959,1.9522,1.7721,0.0133,0.4296,0.4467,2.9091,2.3922,1.0782,0.286,0.3269,3.026,3.0864,1.8716,1.6473,1.1679,1.0085,2.9576,0.8109,0.0433,0.2664,0.6319,3.8537,0.7527,0.0712,0.0847,0.9786,0.1066,0.1283,4.5681,0.5161,1.5941,0.0005,5.6855,1.2948,5.3427,2.0402,1.9101,0.539,0.3571,5.0846,0.7618,0.9755,0.0147,0.2098,0.3224,1.9495,2.6481,0.7217,0.7611,1.3975,0.1209,0.127,0.7436,1.2526,2.3385,0.5619,0.0863,0.1328,0.6453,1.5361,0.0684,0.0473,0.274,6.6377,3.9641,0.616,0.6865,4.5757,1.6661,0.4421,0.5892,3.4136,1.4624,0.2088,5.8171,6.0335,5.8259,0.1161,0.0886,5.5195,2.4614,0.507,1.6352,1.7643,1.9827,1.812,4.3913,2.971,2.859,3.6034,0.0523,4.0239,0.3872,1.2676,0.1453,4.8078,4.1176,0.173,0.9341,1.4895,7.2108,0.8354,2.2595,4.0009,0.0816,0.2214,1.2029,2.9693,0.7515,3.3555,0.6809,1.2485,3.3948,2.3148,0.5442,0.5388,0.4116,2.4028,2.765,0.461,1.9795,4.6054,0.1355,4.7179,0.5169,0.8236,0.5478,0.057,3.8212,1.453,2.5736,0.0175,0.2021,0.1265,1.0931,2.5924,0.6665,6.095,0.7243,0.8717,3.3604,4.4202,1.2619,3.9741,4.4896,5.3319,0.3927,1.5025,1.7722,4.931,0.0454,0.4946,4.7711,0.7189,1.4415,0.4908,0.4675,0.2586,1.2409,0.2154,1.8509,1.511,1.1372,1.7618,0.8125,1.531,2.7854,0.001,0.0312,1.2501,3.4984,0.5698,5.5533,2.8881,1.2907,0.8249,0.5111,1.0302,0.4404,1.3119,4.1408,2.9059,2.2931,0.988,0.0001,5.6036,3.6889,0.0947,0.5564,2.206,1.4856,0.7217,2.0233,1.6918,2.1962,2.0756,2.8833,1.1805,1.5783,5.1206,0.981,2.4146,1.5868,5.9925,5.4054,5.8256,0.7926,3.636,6.4326,0.5979,3.8749,0.9714,3.3019,4.3566,0.283,0.6884,5.0561,0.007,0.1135,1.3771,0.8257,2.6961,0.1679,0.0168,1.0204,1.7232,1.9849,2.6788,4.0179,1.1382,4.6965,5.7951,4.3547,0.5336,0.2671,1.7975,0.0077,0.753,1.4109,2.6471,0.0019,0.0155,0.0027,0.0003,5.055,2.2549,0.1581,0.1489,1.3445,3.6567,0.6861,3.1342,2.3267,4.4718,5.7344,0.3294,1.5463,1.9651,1.299,0.079,4.5406,1.1664,0.0074,2.196,0.2798,1.1887,0.0002,5.6628,3.2604,0.0679,0.9441,0.4378,0.5541,0.0001,5.1894,4.2216,5.0112,0.0002,3.0472,4.8563,4.3759,1.4232,0.4199,0.7568,0.0001,4.4868,1.1923,1.8397,0.9196,5.1898,1.3149,5.3429,0.5217,1.5303,4.681,2.5601,0.0049,2.1366,0.0001,4.8192,0.4072,2.8353,3.1926,0.5618,1.4715,2.5466,2.0349,6.1443,0.4553,2.7534,0.0006,0.6897,0.0007,0.4831,3.1694]}
{"id":2371,"ended":true,"length":362,"gen_text":"Following the autopsy on June 6, Kennedy's body was returned to New York City, where he lay in repose at St. Patrick's Cathedral, viewed by thousands, until a funeral procession departed from St. Patrick's Cathedral to Coney Island. The autopsy report indicated Kennedy's shot had severed half his spine and severed an artery in the spinal cord. Kennedy's condition was not a laughing matter, but there were no further advances in his treatment. This was reported before his body had rested at the hospital for three days, and the doctors could have operated, but refused to. The cause, no one can say for certain, but one can surmise that it was more than simple old age. While he never knew the cause of his illness, he knew with certainty that the diagnosis of a spinal injury or a stroke had come. As a result, doctors were not afraid to advise him he should live out his days in an easy chair. He lived out the rest of his days in the wheelchair. He left his daughters to go off to bed and the doctors watched him. He died some 20 days later... His death may well have been hastened by the stress of having so many visitors. Not one of the doctors who examined Kennedy knew his name. But they did know they would not be back in the same hospital for some time. It was also probably the stress of having people so curious about his condition, that had forced his physician's to give him an easy life. That is what we would today call hospice care. At least most people could get by as they had always done. The Kennedy's, however, could not. And neither could he. And when the time came that neither of them, could endure any more indignities, his doctors advised him to live in the easy chair.

At 4 A.M., police moved in to arrest Thomas. As a large group of officers moved in, Thomas began running into the street with his hands raised in the air. He was arrested and taken away. Williams, who was with him, was never handcuffed. Williams was also arrested at the scene of the protest.\n\n\u2022 A massive crowd gathered outside police headquarters, with a line of police holding on to their trucks and officers on foot. At 3:30 p.m., officers finally broke up the crowd, removing a few protesters, leaving one officer with a sore shoulder, which was later bandaged.\n\n\u2022 Police moved in later that night and again at 5 A.M., and again after midnight, arresting six people. None had criminal records. At 6 A.M., as thousands watched from near the courthouse, police returned to the same scene.\n\n\u2022 Five vehicles were damaged during the protests, including a fire truck and a police vehicle.\n\n\u2022 In a statement, police noted that \"most\" of the people arrested were juveniles.","token_len":372,"entropy":[4.3059,2.8763,0.3075,7.7327,5.3473,1.9356,6.4089,5.4409,4.2234,0.5619,1.3756,6.9514,0.1603,1.8247,1.3163,5.0768,2.908,12.0376,1.4701,0.1086,9.118,0.0705,4.3357,2.1894,1.8604,0.0088,1.0748,0.2151,1.2578,2.4172,3.6888,1.1667,4.564,4.5881,4.4285,13.8317,1.9115,2.6513,3.4034,1.5483,0.0155,4.3444,1.194,0.8511,3.369,0.4835,6.2772,4.8699,0.3681,5.5722,1.0824,3.2676,0.0072,5.4937,5.0438,6.862,0.7153,1.1763,0.0954,1.4073,1.6092,2.4606,0.3172,1.2879,3.662,1.3135,3.9606,0.4922,5.6889,1.857,0.7464,0.5518,0.001,1.921,2.2076,4.3112,1.3008,4.958,1.4881,4.0365,0.7398,3.0298,5.037,1.5433,3.2905,0.4367,3.7232,1.7015,0.3125,0.6972,0.0894,3.5236,1.1794,3.4088,3.3204,1.8444,4.0774,1.5829,2.1954,1.7826,4.9154,2.7194,1.3927,0.0249,2.4394,1.1458,0.671,0.9972,1.3987,1.6481,0.699,3.7909,4.6258,0.0246,0.49,3.6342,1.4647,1.2265,0.0461,0.0002,4.9034,0.7971,6.2513,1.6505,0.0003,4.7885,5.3816,3.5053,1.4052,1.3368,0.2402,4.8231,2.6673,0.1853,3.7284,1.1583,2.04,4.7872,4.1542,0.2969,3.292,4.6313,0.1195,1.1184,0.0609,0.989,1.8516,2.3051,1.0688,2.9004,0.2902,0.8544,3.1176,1.1635,4.3185,5.22,8.7234,0.0013,0.0013,1.0186,2.8377,3.5718,0.3229,0.9646,1.3612,2.1934,2.2519,3.4478,3.1162,4.4258,1.5586,0.3587,1.8936,1.5937,0.3098,0.9079,1.979,3.044,4.111,4.1469,0.4847,1.4464,3.8351,0.7542,0.3869,1.7871,1.3054,0.1726,0.0088,0.4084,1.7068,0.3611,1.3651,1.2177,1.2151,1.1117,1.3874,1.7654,1.6023,0.9202,0.6039,3.033,0.1685,0.1826,0.3062,6.2207,4.4532,0.4911,3.393,1.2773,2.6997,0.8033,2.6867,0.4604,0.968,1.3106,0.3405,1.5809,0.6551,0.5509,0.0003,0.1937,3.2545,5.833,1.3585,1.5931,1.8263,5.2427,0.015,2.1209,3.0133,2.6733,2.1943,0.0764,1.1376,4.6468,5.432,0.1124,3.0603,3.3292,1.2554,3.3347,2.0646,2.2921,1.6827,3.0066,4.903,0.2084,0.8635,2.5954,0.0009,0.0005,0.0899,3.5528,4.2994,3.6112,2.1926,0.0559,0.4565,1.6092,4.7905,2.2619,1.5019,1.4004,2.6852,4.8656,5.7578,2.6913,2.1893,0.4474,4.4978,2.1169,3.2063,4.3316,1.2742,2.0004,3.5645,0.0007,0.2555,0.6479,0.0003,0.1931,3.0404,4.6335,0.4317,5.2078,2.2963,1.4911,2.5094,4.7745,2.0778,2.2506,1.583,0.0009,0.0019,1.3191,4.1688,1.4606,4.6108,1.4179,0.9727,1.9218,3.7264,0.6472,1.0029,5.4987,3.6506,4.2488,0.5574,0.5928,4.0343,2.3095,0.8616,0.0009,0.0012,0.3067,4.6579,5.5123,4.8907,1.7784,5.2993,0.4678,3.2744,0.2855,1.6677,4.8273,0.3217,0.7232,4.4732,2.4392,1.8456,0.8404,0.0003,0.276,5.4316,6.751,0.6475,2.1264,1.8149,0.1603,0.8154,0.9176,0.6457,0.8535,3.4874,0.818,1.3806,0.6481,1.1681,2.0193,0.2759,1.0189,0.0002,0.3271,3.8327,1.6632,1.199,0.8423,3.0078,5.1347,0.3004,2.2383,4.8603,2.4225,0.1674,0.282,1.6807,0.1583,1.009,4.0077,0.8022]}

The structure survived being struck by an earthquake in 431 BC, but most of the sanctuary was destroyed by an earthquake in the final years of the second century AD. A mosaic of a chariot is included in the restoration.\n\nThe monument shows Herakleion's capital, Herakleia, with its ancient city of Heracleion (the earliest known known city in what is now Turkey) and its later ruins.\n\nHerakleion sanctuary, Turkey\n\nHerakleion sanctuary, Turkey\n\nHerakleion sanctuary, Turkey\n\nThe sanctuary's restoration is a collaborative effort by archaeologists and restoration professionals from Italy, France, Turkey, Greece, England, Wales, the USA and Israel.

The reconstruction of the sanctuary is financed by the Eshmun Museum in Istanbul and the Herakleion Foundation.\n\nThis restoration is part of an extensive project that will bring significant upgrades and repairs to the Herakleion sanctuary, and in 2012 the sanctuary's facade underwent an extensive re-painting.","token_len":373,"entropy":[7.4611,6.9181,8.5519,9.8077,2.2451,5.9576,1.251,2.7224,1.9477,0.7322,2.7421,5.8264,0.1084,1.8774,1.1529,2.8891,5.9232,0.8276,7.5033,3.7025,6.9875,0.8318,6.092,10.8248,3.0623,4.8758,1.031,4.3855,0.7461,4.2192,6.833,8.6909,0.0001,1.312,3.023,0.7466,3.681,0.7653,1.1883,1.8465,0.4326,0.2879,4.53,1.2227,1.0995,0.6193,4.1506,2.0829,1.917,1.3173,1.6504,5.6246,1.633,0.2339,0.8641,6.1363,1.0483,4.7881,3.612,3.1804,0.2881,0.8208,4.7706,2.7651,1.1655,6.1112,0.3344,0.3868,0.597,1.6817,2.5354,1.8227,4.6417,0.0362,0.3093,4.6076,1.8934,3.9612,0.9075,0.4381,3.5748,0.8583,5.2757,0.7081,0.5711,0.8434,0.0421,1.5797,2.6114,2.0421,4.5681,4.0593,1.0535,3.15,5.678,2.1121,0.0992,0.5918,4.7815,3.1749,2.7556,5.4022,1.0309,0.3281,3.3916,1.1749,1.8012,2.2073,1.6959,0.6535,1.6021,0.0895,0.1093,2.6776,0.4735,5.4934,4.7872,0.0258,0.3282,2.5919,1.9446,0.6841,1.042,3.898,5.7889,6.4785,2.2044,0.0526,0.5097,0.0108,0.3897,2.7999,2.8352,0.1569,0.5984,1.7543,5.2413,0.0855,0.2186,2.9621,0.6319,0.431,0.828,1.1866,0.0589,0.1619,1.4257,7.1891,1.884,0.0068,0.0895,2.919,0.1477,1.7258,0.3208,3.8896,3.3298,1.9776,2.3738,4.4163,0.0384,4.4456,5.1486,0.3853,0.123,3.0407,1.5177,0.5352,0.0002,1.0892,5.6164,6.194,2.6428,0.0275,0.079,0.3735,1.5746,4.5934,1.7967,1.7846,0.3743,0.0429,1.9314,0.2937,2.3002,1.1275,4.9783,2.7465,1.1247,0.9942,0.4134,0.2113,2.8329,3.0142,5.2194,1.2283,4.0221,1.4644,0.6352,5.44,0.2275,0.16,1.7444,1.3693,1.2094,1.5581,4.4552,4.1969,0.7554,1.8032,0.0002,3.0658,0.0168,0.0053,0.5044,6.1324,2.1748,1.9696,0.638,0.0002,1.7108,0.0115,0.0048,0.1798,1.074,0.2095,0.1063,0.1059,0.0001,0.3725,0.0019,0.0013,0.0127,0.0873,0.0323,0.0089,0.0635,0.0001,2.5724,1.703,2.265,3.6283,1.4813,2.6492,3.3152,0.4255,2.5704,3.2938,1.926,2.2217,2.7544,0.8166,4.4094,0.2842,2.4103,0.2429,2.1773,0.387,1.6049,0.3475,3.8692,0.3787,5.799,0.4169,2.1799,1.4366,1.0334,3.2349,0.2264,1.507,5.9619,3.205,5.0997,1.1183,0.6038,0.9227,1.7161,4.5682,2.1434,3.8534,5.1943,1.5029,0.1672,1.5037,7.5313,0.0439,3.8042,3.4167,4.653,0.4962,5.5671,2.0255,0.2232,1.2799,1.0766,4.7448,1.2924,1.3327,3.3455,0.2369,1.4237,1.5421,0.7348,2.0082,1.9674,1.4818,4.1351,1.2905,0.1332,1.9639,4.466,1.1295,0.3158,0.4263,1.6396,5.1046,0.1999,0.4352,4.017,0.5356,0.0023,4.0401,2.1958,0.74,1.8639,0.5131,3.19,0.0253,0.0014,0.0541,1.0963,0.9632,0.3725,0.0002,4.1386,3.0771,1.4038,1.4282,0.0035,2.2916,2.9617,1.7177,2.9569,2.2413,3.9445,6.6885,6.0732,2.2036,3.3677,0.0375,0.4624,1.5938,0.004,0.0007,0.0117,1.0974,1.3641,2.0,4.3901,4.3772,1.0162,1.9461,2.635,4.2311,3.6828,2.4512,0.7129,4.166,0.3914,1.6421,0.0002,1.0991]}

The two will work together and coordinate flight activities aboard the ship to enhance maritime protection and interoperability among carriers in a maritime environment.\n\n-- Bryant Jordan can be reached at Bryant.jordan@military.com","token_len":373,"entropy":[5.5632,0.2046,1.5985,14.2837,3.9344,6.7929,1.9391,1.4924,7.4959,2.693,2.1592,2.231,0.3762,5.9288,1.3291,0.4739,1.5993,0.8834,0.222,2.5477,4.1093,3.8871,0.1559,9.9754,13.972,10.0918,7.7218,13.2138,12.1617,3.4064,0.8707,2.6261,2.7182,7.8199,1.7813,4.1768,0.0718,3.1373,2.4183,0.4391,2.9445,0.0218,3.0722,1.333,0.3813,0.027,0.9667,4.2063,0.7095,0.4369,1.4377,2.9377,2.498,0.8366,3.1996,0.0002,1.3521,3.2351,0.3715,2.7829,1.5667,1.0574,0.1958,1.3351,3.5979,0.8111,1.8066,0.0128,5.9103,5.4606,2.1816,0.0133,2.3853,0.0002,1.0443,4.4996,0.8944,2.029,3.8973,5.1394,3.9401,4.7683,2.5758,2.5859,4.204,5.3863,5.1614,4.6907,0.5714,4.8119,1.1932,0.891,1.0186,0.0002,1.3862,5.2624,1.6811,3.7528,4.097,0.9622,3.929,3.5358,5.2176,4.6223,5.9687,0.0014,1.9803,4.7189,3.1104,0.0,0.3475,0.3942,1.7081,5.0487,0.3247,5.4048,4.9842,0.1647,4.4192,0.7379,2.6425,4.4111,3.334,2.0684,3.5711,0.1768,1.8154,1.7221,0.5497,0.8372,0.2781,1.8432,1.4202,1.9598,0.5241,4.7702,0.2604,1.9712,0.7723,0.2587,0.0032,1.4626,0.0,0.0074,0.8137,0.4001,4.8409,1.6941,5.9703,2.0483,3.6314,0.6306,5.4919,4.6875,1.9207,0.0488,0.248,5.4059,0.0007,1.679,2.1387,1.9533,4.0883,0.0097,2.6757,2.5779,0.1245,0.0385,2.9479,0.0,0.0,0.3806,0.0332,1.1613,2.2511,2.3366,3.6584,0.9166,4.6731,2.6754,2.1542,5.6237,3.9664,2.8371,0.0008,0.8452,0.855,2.2894,3.8488,0.0029,0.714,1.7153,1.991,2.4307,1.188,1.7377,5.8798,5.0963,1.2684,1.0556,0.0018,0.7066,0.011,2.5743,4.056,0.0031,0.3681,0.6562,0.3031,4.7909,0.0081,0.0294,0.0318,0.0035,0.0258,2.7026,1.6227,3.5055,0.2792,0.1021,0.0452,0.2036,0.0003,3.9435,0.0167,2.1583,4.1547,2.1029,5.3667,2.6657,4.4246,0.0096,3.7522,5.5036,1.1146,0.1217,0.0075,0.1476,0.0553,2.4702,3.8052,1.3867,2.9216,0.2524,2.3311,0.0491,0.4732,0.4071,0.0134,0.004,0.6362,0.9726,1.4316,3.1693,0.31,2.4159,3.5128,0.0041,1.5213,2.0568,2.7035,2.6086,3.0921,1.6085,5.2009,0.1634,0.5981,3.213,4.0963,3.7753,2.8257,0.2521,0.3649,0.1414,3.8813,1.903,0.0028,3.8557,0.2205,0.7662,0.9734,0.0003,1.4823,2.1227,1.6222,0.557,2.5012,1.1849,5.3128,2.4647,0.8608,0.0207,0.4697,0.4086,0.0769,0.0011,3.8202,1.9649,0.9564,0.003,0.1286,0.0103,0.0013,0.001,3.8673,2.9967,2.5532,2.2646,0.5833,0.893,5.9272,1.7071,1.7345,2.1243,5.293,2.057,1.4051,1.2121,3.8622,6.344,2.0985,6.9405,6.7959,1.3204,5.3435,5.6778,4.3734,0.0335,2.6929,1.2368,5.2768,3.6533,2.7599,0.3003,3.4884,3.7115,5.1759,4.3029,5.8447,1.3439,3.4998,2.4775,4.418,2.4837,5.2437,1.6645,4.6507,0.0077,3.5102,5.6656,3.4943,2.4889,3.9908,1.0825,0.246,0.3355,0.0003,3.8798,2.6043,0.0051,0.0234,0.001,0.0268,0.0021,0.6617,0.0456,0.4685,0.0008,0.0007,0.135,0.0022,0.0]}

On 26 September 1944 the ship landed to great acclaim, despite a slight hull breach but with an exceptionally high percentage of troops who were able to swim. During the landing the crew suffered over 1000 casualties in the first few hours, and during the following three months 578 casualties were taken in four days. The bridge was torpedoed and the engine room severely damaged but survived to the end. While on the ground on 27 October 1944, Allied naval guns attacked with 4.5inch projectiles, followed by mortar barrages. The ship was attacked more than 80 times in the first month, and was nearly attacked twice, twice in February and March, during the Normandy campaign itself. On the night of 26-27 December 1944 there was a very heavy barrage which caused a massive fire on some of the decks, and a subsequent explosion which caused the bridge to separate from the ship. A number of casualties were caused and the crew spent the night of 27 December in a shelter aboard the USS Essex. On 30 December the ship was attacked by the German battleship, which was able to inflict damage only to the engine room. In February 1945 she was sunk by the Japanese submarine, and on 8 March 1945 she sank by fire of the Japanese battleship, which was hit. The two ship are now together in the English Channel. The ship has been converted into a museum and visitors can go aboard the ship to view the decks and gun decks and also the boat crew quarters. The museum is open to the public from Monday to Sunday at 10:30am.","token_len":374,"entropy":[10.1869,2.5468,8.2229,3.2491,1.6245,5.5206,6.4379,0.2575,8.6686,1.1153,5.3451,6.5934,1.9362,4.7103,13.3668,8.0915,6.8344,8.6911,6.2104,4.9477,3.2899,5.0494,5.1903,4.0969,1.6316,4.3318,0.4364,9.2045,3.5166,13.1105,3.0022,7.4894,4.2313,0.9038,3.8245,7.807,0.233,0.5887,1.6678,3.1713,0.1108,3.8788,1.0882,1.0381,3.345,2.7736,1.4634,1.3048,5.7348,2.6065,0.7671,3.1833,2.3568,3.1942,0.6145,2.4846,0.7575,3.2696,1.7912,1.4557,1.3244,3.5299,2.9588,0.2245,3.3506,4.291,3.0136,0.6346,1.6667,3.5269,4.1288,5.4973,2.794,0.9399,1.5993,4.8085,2.2448,5.975,4.4798,1.6364,5.527,2.9807,4.0515,5.1938,1.4416,3.6127,0.0536,3.591,2.9835,1.8013,1.6745,0.0099,2.1009,1.1076,4.8432,0.3548,3.0608,1.3914,3.7546,3.6953,4.2057,3.6338,0.0684,3.8015,1.2631,1.5119,2.2492,0.7689,1.4939,2.1065,4.4246,0.2258,2.1784,3.1425,2.4706,6.0168,4.9288,2.8487,0.6684,3.1425,2.748,5.8123,2.7642,0.934,1.5726,5.5786,0.915,5.7269,0.0021,1.4797,1.1782,5.8303,0.5274,4.5073,0.0781,2.4889,5.1888,2.0822,2.251,0.4417,1.2666,5.9658,2.8604,0.9288,3.9168,4.1981,3.5052,1.8707,0.5729,1.2735,6.3944,4.0214,3.4282,4.1851,3.499,5.0169,1.5377,0.9995,3.2099,5.1363,1.3823,5.4042,0.253,4.345,4.7852,0.0008,1.4883,1.0966,1.5528,0.6773,4.556,6.1854,0.24,4.7141,0.0172,2.289,1.0062,2.154,2.6992,1.4836,1.0424,3.2017,5.6233,4.9471,3.3179,2.7137,3.7353,2.4123,4.1814,0.6785,4.0149,1.9689,4.8366,1.2605,3.7974,1.122,6.1451,0.2361,2.283,1.9868,2.1087,0.0288,3.6134,1.5133,0.0104,3.2765,0.3674,5.1836,0.2246,0.5415,4.5065,0.8687,3.9152,3.1602,2.0272,2.4637,4.2746,1.1676,1.6264,7.2865,1.1565,0.0365,1.5673,1.2696,1.4249,2.6006,4.2898,1.5521,2.2974,2.7455,1.4487,3.0237,0.1481,6.0796,0.3214,0.0454,1.848,0.5518,3.5733,3.2299,0.0036,1.4833,0.4432,1.405,3.1164,0.7788,3.0708,4.3032,1.0302,0.9062,3.6931,0.8802,0.6209,1.9147,1.5423,3.4913,5.8395,0.4178,4.4487,5.385,0.7734,1.5147,3.4029,0.1828,1.6137,0.8711,0.5891,1.7337,0.8215,2.7679,2.1698,2.2902,0.0248,3.1551,4.1153,1.7477,3.6043,0.0039,3.8982,2.4677,5.4535,1.9383,0.3486,3.8566,0.0707,0.9956,3.507,2.5483,0.1265,4.2127,0.3813,2.9305,0.4767,1.2078,2.1775,0.86,0.7547,2.4563,2.0754,3.5374,0.9945,0.6127,0.6634,2.2402,1.4968,4.7001,3.5769,0.541,2.198,2.9755,0.0133,0.2508,1.3576,1.4836,4.1631,5.8779,1.3067,5.741,5.0669,3.0385,0.8294,4.5908,1.2852,0.5068,3.5702,0.0402,0.7974,1.7181,2.7828,2.797,0.9417,3.8925,0.6698,0.1686,0.2828,1.6523,4.4519,0.6103,3.6395,1.8638,2.0066,1.1832,1.5224,2.1416,0.9426,5.4653,0.8628,5.1094,2.9209,2.632,3.4536,2.0223,5.7234,6.0709,0.6032,0.6126,1.3686,2.3277,1.0964,0.6846,1.5032,0.119,0.0302,1.4263,2.541,0.1325,1.4072,4.3898,1.1966,1.5829,1.5232,1.265,1.0282]}

It was executed by James I in 1753 in the year that Mary died, and the work was paid for by money lent to the king from the Treasury of England.\n\nThe engraving above is by a painter of the 1730s, Robert Cairns. It shows Newton's head and shoulders encircled by a circle of stars and asterism, and at his feet is a globe placed between two circular wheels, representing the firmament. The engraving was intended to show the earth's magnetic field, but it never came to pass. Newton's original work, with which this engraving was prepared may have included illustrations of the planets and a full description of their orbits.\n\nNewton's monument is located in the Great Hall, which contains the King's Chair, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and, on the floor in a recess, the grave of Queen Anne, Newton's wife.\n\nNewton's tomb may be seen through a portal in the east of the church. When he died, he had not yet been interred in Westminster Abbey, but was buried in his mansion of Woolsthorpe in Oxfordshire ; thenceforth, he was buried in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nNewton died on December 20, 1727 and was succeeded by his brother, Robert Boyle Newton. His tomb in the Great Hall, though never completed as yet, has recently been opened and will now be restored to its previous appearance, and he died in 1750.\n\nMore info: Wikipedia\n\nImage by: wikipedia\n\nImage by: wikipedia\n\nImage by: www.britishartcentury.com","token_len":375,"entropy":[5.607,2.0326,11.3356,4.7571,9.4057,5.663,1.1142,7.2531,0.2884,0.5725,1.3466,6.1215,0.1857,1.9173,4.7162,0.2602,3.4359,3.4274,0.158,3.4616,0.9103,0.3772,4.9543,9.6596,0.2862,5.4368,4.5439,2.0801,3.4326,6.3529,1.4993,0.5414,2.4499,1.515,7.3206,0.6744,3.8632,2.7626,2.1167,1.3176,5.2092,4.2163,1.3478,5.2096,2.4823,6.3186,2.389,1.2736,0.706,3.2203,3.3159,0.829,5.3625,0.0231,0.267,5.0896,3.5272,1.0065,0.6534,1.5274,3.2219,0.5876,2.186,1.9946,1.6985,0.5587,2.026,0.1399,1.7403,5.2897,0.0598,0.0762,2.5497,1.2917,1.7488,3.964,4.2867,2.2762,0.4029,3.4675,1.6254,0.2265,0.7902,4.9342,4.9751,3.9295,0.2843,1.281,1.3526,0.9362,1.6433,1.6777,2.795,2.6747,2.3416,5.5445,0.4194,0.0249,0.1465,1.1148,1.7532,0.2438,2.1284,3.0559,5.4975,2.0382,1.4023,1.3933,4.638,2.3234,0.1538,1.2904,0.6541,3.2761,5.9708,4.3758,0.8497,5.8558,4.4011,1.6803,3.9372,0.3679,5.8532,0.1178,0.691,1.2203,3.3856,0.0087,0.48,1.4827,4.833,0.3556,2.0049,1.2284,4.6135,1.1786,4.9903,0.5593,1.1146,1.7834,1.3906,5.6952,3.4104,0.9654,0.5517,0.4876,2.4707,1.241,3.7608,3.5588,2.0578,3.2839,3.0228,2.8797,1.1077,0.0018,0.0014,0.9124,5.0167,7.5646,1.2173,4.0761,5.2528,0.3898,0.8928,3.2717,1.3764,3.8857,5.3383,2.5382,0.0139,2.1665,2.2204,0.5144,0.9178,0.0002,2.6674,0.0052,0.6487,3.3002,1.7851,3.108,1.2083,0.4416,5.7894,0.9076,1.2857,2.5633,2.9974,0.6029,4.5677,0.0667,3.4079,0.9508,0.9278,6.1345,0.1886,0.5279,0.1596,0.2124,0.305,0.7457,5.4183,1.7804,0.2628,4.3902,3.2278,4.3102,1.1385,0.6593,0.3005,5.2452,0.0282,2.824,1.7975,1.3659,3.7242,0.0085,1.6272,0.543,1.3431,0.0002,2.3663,0.0067,0.4627,2.0712,5.3048,0.488,0.9669,4.6177,0.8919,5.7375,0.7387,0.1713,3.1038,3.7584,0.2821,3.9066,1.3519,5.2934,2.8756,0.8955,0.7983,1.3213,2.6557,3.2772,0.5683,1.3939,1.2809,0.0004,1.1154,0.7579,0.026,0.815,1.1565,1.797,1.8184,0.4291,2.9714,6.5206,1.9804,3.4457,0.3709,0.0013,0.0021,1.7018,3.3972,0.0141,9.933,5.8162,3.7546,1.0187,1.995,0.2869,1.2123,0.3775,1.1873,2.9525,0.284,1.8066,2.1029,0.3155,0.0347,0.67,0.8232,0.0002,2.1664,0.0049,3.5582,0.8014,3.538,3.1942,0.0698,0.8401,0.0974,4.2373,0.2992,4.4421,0.6436,0.37,2.6814,1.1745,1.2642,4.8099,1.3855,1.5616,2.7481,1.9666,3.3636,1.5288,1.0369,0.0151,2.8883,4.7201,4.6836,1.004,5.3657,2.9056,0.034,2.3792,4.2922,0.0608,2.1629,1.3729,3.5266,4.4569,0.3136,2.2355,1.3647,0.2772,5.3067,1.2926,2.6341,2.4073,4.5072,6.7959,1.2365,0.8895,3.2089,0.4735,0.6251,0.0002,5.477,4.4206,0.8248,2.2192,1.7415,0.0002,4.9085,3.4236,3.1657,5.6392,0.6853,1.4227,0.0002,4.3597,0.6243,0.0092,1.8881,0.1191,0.2957,0.0002,0.5495,0.0201,0.0024,4.5819,0.0166,3.3926,0.6802,0.159,4.8736,6.1098,0.0334,0.8357]}

The proteome will also allow researchers to examine protein-protein interactions; for instance, between a protein involved in a process, with another protein that modifies that process.

The proteome provides us with enormous new data to analyze, and the new field of @ - @ proteomics offers an array of new and intriguing questions to study. The @ - @ proteomics data comes with a huge database, the TPCa proteome database. A proteomics data set is defined by a number of independent data sources, and each data set is defined in its own way, using a series of different metrics to identify the best proteins for the particular question at hand. In practice, the best proteins will often be those that are the best at a given task. Proteomes are complex and often diverse, and we are currently at a position where we are able to model the overall function of cells, and to study how these proteomes interact. And when you combine that with the ability to understand how these protein interactions play out in cells on a large scale, we expect that we will have at hand a powerful new tool in the fight against cancer.","token_len":378,"entropy":[7.4174,10.4006,0.2351,6.4829,4.253,3.6467,2.4849,4.7745,2.0473,1.406,0.7049,3.7536,3.7426,3.182,0.999,2.1314,0.0387,2.3838,2.0515,0.0221,2.4916,0.7067,1.572,6.5652,0.5377,4.2917,6.1439,14.9113,7.4334,10.3476,9.5573,2.1626,0.3821,10.3832,1.1194,4.4239,3.0901,0.0429,1.1489,0.5212,0.1063,3.6598,2.219,3.8211,2.9099,0.0023,4.0382,5.4483,0.3652,3.9443,0.1682,0.0008,0.0001,0.06,2.0568,1.4526,0.3443,5.0037,4.4815,4.3954,3.0969,5.9237,0.6335,0.0855,1.1852,0.141,1.5046,1.6608,2.519,2.1071,2.3268,2.2555,1.0604,0.1321,0.8727,0.0123,1.0654,1.5684,2.1859,3.5282,2.2411,4.3292,5.6495,1.1203,2.9581,0.0102,2.6768,4.3673,2.0124,2.3978,1.744,0.8904,5.5764,2.104,0.6905,5.0985,0.7926,4.6249,3.3761,0.1948,1.0597,0.6043,1.4328,1.9087,2.5129,3.4524,0.1751,4.3918,3.3076,0.0014,0.0922,1.0335,4.0654,3.6064,5.1466,3.7555,0.0039,2.706,5.2025,2.7318,0.0156,0.6929,4.4547,1.5572,2.7702,0.2718,2.4948,2.5713,0.3593,3.9293,1.8921,2.0448,2.6498,0.0385,4.1166,3.2821,2.0204,0.2054,0.1573,5.6587,2.3319,2.035,0.042,5.8646,1.8448,1.4796,2.9587,0.0052,1.8293,3.3861,3.1885,6.8013,1.8423,0.2344,1.0944,3.3706,1.133,1.655,0.2069,0.8788,3.5649,5.229,1.639,1.8288,0.1061,3.2558,0.4888,0.035,0.142,1.2009,0.2758,4.5611,0.7392,3.8033,5.7519,4.2079,1.0224,0.7526,4.799,3.0129,0.8882,0.6846,2.3777,1.4592,0.2127,4.0055,3.0355,0.1824,6.3936,2.2727,2.5873,2.3096,2.4752,0.8825,0.8199,2.4325,2.4404,5.8737,0.2154,0.5226,0.0529,0.0373,0.0786,0.0034,3.7295,3.3428,4.7089,0.0028,1.4331,3.2894,5.0459,1.2344,1.0264,2.7227,0.2561,2.8529,2.7121,0.0393,0.0159,0.2919,1.0245,2.4087,6.0712,3.4232,1.3742,3.8114,5.6428,1.8965,3.8504,5.403,3.3086,4.0227,4.1101,0.0817,1.029,2.0559,4.3623,2.8537,3.0721,2.4406,0.6151,1.2913,2.6111,1.4123,1.7134,3.0685,0.0397,4.7501,2.0057,1.8974,0.8682,1.1731,2.3837,0.7413,0.268,1.1627,2.4687,2.7631,2.9096,0.0302,0.585,2.0702,4.2978,2.222,6.7551,0.0066,2.7852,3.9414,2.3688,3.2974,1.399,4.1422,5.1078,1.4742,1.9253,2.7699,3.7122,2.1683,0.0059,0.1034,3.0282,5.0581,0.057,1.5603,2.6768,2.4326,2.9904,2.8704,0.8726,2.1771,0.3784,1.3008,2.0369,2.2487,1.1779,2.7619,1.2212,1.3045,1.3165,5.7333,0.0002,2.7868,0.979,4.6507,2.3935,3.8155,4.3244,0.6587,0.671,3.3339,1.9125,3.3967,4.1805,1.3442,6.4463,0.176,0.6655,1.7394,1.5448,0.0071,5.387,1.2014,4.1025,0.8791,0.0955,5.4043,1.8835,1.0645,2.6264,3.2962,2.0747,2.6466,4.2095,0.0374,1.7324,1.518,5.622,4.8028,2.6595,1.7189,2.9167,0.2504,0.9177,2.5602,0.0658,3.8359,1.403,2.5153,3.9206,1.0984,3.9143,0.1092,0.8589,2.4765,5.5685,0.2355,2.3688,0.2007,0.0738,2.241,6.8798,1.4397,1.353,0.2784,2.2739,5.7537,3.5182,0.8337,1.4047,0.9514,0.4263,2.5041,0.7243,1.7221,0.0324,0.6074,0.5132]}

{"id":1963,"ended":false,"length":351,"gen_text":"Wales compete annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations : England, France, Ireland, Italy, and Scotland. The Six Nations started as the English'Grand Slam'in the 19th century and has since become one of the most prestigious tournaments in the sport. Rugby is also an integral part of the Welsh economy, as several clubs play a part in the national competitive rugby teams. During June and July 2012 Rugby World Cup matches are played and held at Cardiff International Stadium. The stadium is the home of four Welsh National Team rugby union and three Welsh Sevens teams.\n\nIn the past we have discussed the two major differences between Wales and Scotland. Scotland has a shorter history on the international rugby stage since the 1960s with only 4 Tests, 9 Nations Rugby Championship matches, and two appearances at the World Cup. Despite being small in population, Scotland has won more international rugby matches than Wales. In recent years, Wales has struggled to win and is generally weaker than the other three countries of Great Britain. England and France have dominated the rugby competitions for some time.\n\nScotland also has a shorter history in the sport than the English and Welsh nations. It's not surprising that the Scots share this advantage. Scotland has played a lot of rugby at club level. On the other hand, England and France did play a lot of rugby (and competed at the World Cup) but were later overshadowed by their peers. The English and French national teams both had huge professional empires in the 50s and 60s and in subsequent generations, these rugby empires have continued to grow.\n\nWhat will happen to this situation in 2014-2015? Is Wales going to keep on losing to France and England? Or will the English teams dominate once again?\n\nWe'll tell you tomorrow.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nGoogle","token_len":379,"entropy":[7.7177,9.8082,10.5028,0.6606,0.3032,1.7965,0.001,2.0285,1.2158,1.9951,1.2988,1.7433,4.2353,6.2859,0.7769,4.2381,0.7222,9.5283,1.2966,0.0775,0.6036,0.0112,1.3319,0.0116,0.4513,2.0041,0.2235,0.4731,0.1359,1.8035,2.7118,0.0107,5.7723,4.4448,2.3634,3.895,8.0706,12.3409,0.058,3.7641,2.436,1.8658,2.9359,0.034,0.1665,1.7788,1.4493,1.5544,1.2745,1.6924,0.0086,0.0517,0.4383,1.2864,1.8883,0.2215,0.6376,2.3105,0.4365,6.1341,1.3347,2.8576,3.2637,2.542,0.0351,0.0239,0.5422,1.3289,2.7655,0.8511,2.4158,5.9732,3.6405,3.082,4.82,1.1018,0.0542,0.5712,1.4576,7.1461,2.4827,2.5214,0.4906,5.8874,7.0402,0.9861,0.0607,5.2242,5.7933,0.5911,0.0095,1.8027,1.3719,1.1162,6.2933,4.7645,1.4221,1.3574,3.8275,0.0452,0.8342,2.0842,1.3588,1.19,2.2078,1.1555,0.4783,6.5203,1.0358,3.2864,2.0084,2.4675,5.2598,3.9499,2.8874,0.2233,4.1189,0.035,0.6588,0.3771,1.296,0.0251,3.3285,2.0394,3.0943,6.521,0.474,5.0108,1.0982,5.6686,2.645,3.62,0.2771,3.2079,0.0827,2.2145,1.0075,3.5715,1.6659,0.8939,6.1884,1.4714,5.4728,0.155,1.2491,2.2152,1.038,5.493,1.0896,4.3636,0.4451,4.4069,1.8962,5.4425,4.1244,2.2397,5.1208,1.1997,3.814,1.7105,0.7554,0.322,0.323,2.8461,5.1019,1.0101,0.2189,1.6908,0.0595,0.6506,5.1806,2.7494,5.3967,1.1622,1.6792,0.6637,0.3725,0.694,2.6469,1.9358,2.025,1.3094,0.7758,0.554,0.4145,1.2248,2.6507,3.5436,0.3276,1.1802,1.8705,0.5072,4.2745,0.4521,2.5109,5.4828,4.3377,5.217,5.4056,0.6007,2.0107,1.6754,2.0515,2.0688,3.5034,3.5361,0.0018,0.4876,5.4249,1.8314,0.9132,1.0151,2.2858,0.5716,2.0255,3.8442,2.0504,4.642,0.1615,1.5865,1.6618,0.0002,3.6915,3.2183,0.6243,0.7939,4.6208,0.3876,1.7278,0.9032,2.0139,1.5388,3.0424,4.9536,1.5705,0.9445,3.2484,0.291,3.6319,3.1124,2.3448,2.1797,0.6175,1.5078,1.6477,5.8925,2.9232,2.9859,2.4312,2.0971,1.1189,2.5997,2.0241,2.9859,0.2446,0.8952,4.0023,3.6261,0.3174,2.2633,6.0443,0.6386,1.7663,0.038,0.1273,1.6063,0.5887,1.1944,5.5645,5.2154,0.8186,0.1957,0.1659,0.2894,6.9326,1.8047,5.7925,1.2912,0.2949,1.1848,0.048,0.2947,2.6778,3.4551,5.2159,3.4324,0.0791,2.5511,5.1087,0.4316,2.361,1.6178,0.6068,0.2302,2.2833,0.318,4.2688,2.7322,5.5972,4.9582,6.2195,1.9081,0.1841,5.5637,0.2272,0.3142,0.0551,0.0045,2.3491,5.2608,5.5728,4.6614,1.9774,3.0142,4.3303,2.2696,1.3275,2.6609,0.397,1.2381,0.5825,1.5184,0.0002,4.472,4.8,1.5949,1.1218,3.9806,3.4043,0.7928,4.4407,6.0738,0.8038,0.1557,4.9524,2.4196,1.2332,0.0067,4.0319,3.0314,2.4791,1.2766,3.4847,0.6435,0.1484,0.684,1.5179,0.8044,1.5286,3.1906,5.8256,3.3789,4.3707,0.1852,0.2951,1.4509,0.0001,3.4645,2.6342,5.8241,0.0164,4.041,0.6706,0.7236,0.0001,4.2159,0.0827,0.0966,0.4329,0.0009,0.0002,0.0949,0.0745,0.0002,3.8443,0.0918,0.0002,0.6861]}
{"id":2789,"ended":false,"length":335,"gen_text":"Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez received the Nobel Prize in Literature on 8 December 1982 `` for his novels and short stories, in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of magic and violence''. His stories are known for their graphic descriptions of violence.\n\nThe five judges of the prize said in a statement: ``The Mexican writer, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, has given us a new language with which we can make sense of history; his prose is vivid and imaginative; his characters have an extraordinary degree of pathos; and his sentences are complex and complex-sounding but never ponderous. All these have been demonstrated in `El Hombre del Sur', written in 1971 and published twenty years later. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez has given us one of the most original and distinctive literary cultures in the world. His most recent novel shows considerable promise: the book is called `One Hundred Years of Solitude', and it is published in the United States in late September. We will award it to him on October 7 at a ceremony in Stockholm.''\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez has written seven novels. ''Seven'' is about a father and son who go for a vacation in a secluded corner of the country. They decide to leave their possessions behind, but a storm hits the coast leaving one of the son's relatives dead.\n\nOne of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's best known works is ''In the Penal Colony', an account of the political repression committed by the Mexican state during the country's two world wars. It won the Booker prize in 1985.\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez will receive his award from the Swedish Academy of Literature at Stockholm's Royal Academy Hall. The event will be broadcast live on Swedish television and in newspapers across the world.\n\nL.V.

He described US efforts so far as largely defensive, but that \"the U.S. commitment is real.\"\n\nReferences","token_len":384,"entropy":[6.9948,2.7325,1.3914,4.6021,4.6408,9.2895,3.6981,3.3527,0.7043,5.3334,9.4341,0.7516,1.8258,3.1334,0.516,3.3792,1.1541,4.7253,8.2064,6.4384,0.4171,0.2274,6.4227,2.4911,4.3334,0.4308,7.4833,0.5115,0.6154,7.5669,2.6057,0.35,3.977,2.3441,0.9906,2.6938,0.0297,1.2634,9.6271,1.3668,3.4045,0.595,2.2259,0.0089,3.6193,2.6628,0.0467,0.3908,0.4243,0.828,4.1286,0.7891,5.2469,1.9944,0.8213,3.5341,0.2865,2.6175,1.1061,4.749,1.4218,4.7388,1.8925,2.2002,5.9064,2.8421,0.3389,0.0377,1.436,6.227,0.0554,0.3078,0.0604,1.9548,1.7224,1.547,2.0517,1.7647,0.0678,0.0017,2.5509,0.9989,1.4044,1.7909,4.1175,4.3054,0.382,3.0365,2.5665,0.2169,0.1663,4.4874,0.5455,1.7361,3.5203,0.0348,0.1348,1.2841,0.0013,0.0015,0.0088,1.3938,2.0353,3.4618,0.3659,2.3012,4.9544,2.1039,1.413,0.0179,2.5287,6.9172,6.7182,2.8813,4.1902,1.6938,1.0673,3.8745,2.1049,0.0598,4.399,0.3923,3.7931,2.568,1.1609,3.8314,1.8728,5.5641,0.0352,3.4758,0.0046,1.2455,0.8336,1.3281,0.2442,3.4008,2.4246,0.1999,0.1349,0.8633,2.7228,0.1089,1.4914,4.1558,0.5567,4.4904,0.5039,0.4625,1.0594,0.5066,0.0113,0.0002,0.9778,3.2186,4.499,0.0071,0.111,2.4548,1.1436,2.5407,0.0012,0.5711,1.7181,4.8727,1.8831,2.6116,0.6388,1.1402,2.7438,0.0024,0.8623,2.1852,0.6702,3.1745,3.7232,3.2678,0.1447,0.4172,0.0002,3.1453,5.0158,0.003,4.3147,2.0176,5.6063,3.4237,0.0121,3.7226,0.2785,5.1196,3.2223,0.3057,4.3045,1.7065,3.4828,0.4345,1.2584,1.0963,0.0092,2.3045,0.996,0.282,1.1741,0.3635,4.978,0.4496,0.1166,2.177,1.7484,1.9041,4.0143,1.9954,0.033,2.8922,6.1231,4.7461,0.3355,0.3624,2.0737,0.6808,3.1334,4.5511,6.3208,1.9236,0.925,0.0196,2.3832,2.5342,1.3607,0.061,0.3096,3.6389,1.0027,4.1748,0.4985,2.4804,0.9315,0.0002,1.2404,4.2389,0.0012,4.7402,0.0022,5.98,4.2368,3.7674,1.674,0.5784,3.7916,2.4898,1.8976,0.8349,2.5537,0.3652,1.9548,0.1686,1.9126,5.1637,4.2002,2.3291,5.0523,0.8622,4.0638,5.7171,0.6356,4.8992,3.934,2.1547,0.0035,0.006,3.4231,0.5962,0.0001,1.1029,2.9887,0.001,2.2295,2.4094,7.0953,0.0918,1.127,2.2546,3.7153,0.3686,2.2928,0.9184,0.0393,1.071,3.1499,4.2267,0.0154,1.9519,0.6043,2.7208,0.767,7.578,0.3781,0.2684,0.3912,0.0021,0.2988,1.8088,1.3893,2.0246,0.0305,1.9338,3.9379,0.0459,5.0263,0.6572,0.5803,2.8995,0.7654,0.0035,3.0314,3.942,5.5551,0.5406,5.5486,1.9185,5.8219,2.9099,4.571,4.2591,2.1237,1.3161,5.334,1.317,2.4319,0.5973,1.1134,1.2297,2.9852,4.4575,0.3331,1.0041,3.2872,4.1393,1.4478,3.4699,2.8231,0.0666,0.0048,3.9256,4.6623,6.6746,1.5343,4.0366,2.8492,0.1532,0.9197,1.9525,4.7683,0.3363,0.127,0.2992,0.0659,2.4818,3.0128,4.9875,3.7387,2.2844,5.6666,0.002,0.4429,6.3477,3.9786,0.8804,2.1903,2.544,1.598,2.23,3.9734,0.0039,0.0298,0.0154,3.8721,1.245,5.0406,1.6631,0.3511,0.0002,4.6953]}

{"id":214,"ended":true,"length":347,"gen_text":"* Awards from Legends of Hockey = Saint Leonard Catholic Church ( Madison, Nebraska ) = Saint Leonard Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church in the city of Madison, in the state of Nebraska. The church is located approximately five miles from the United States Patent and Trademark Office in the city of Madison, Nebraska. Its main building has a church-like appearance with a steeple and stained glass windows. The main part of the original building was torn down in the early 1970s. The church reopened as a state-of-the-art facility in 2002. The property was named for the late Saint Leonard Thomas, Saint Leonard Catholic Church's Patron Saint (1924\u20131989). Thomas was a Roman Catholic Bishop who served for twenty-two years in the Archdiocese of Saint Louis. Saint Leonard is the patron saint of nursing, a field that plays heavily in hockey. The school's mascot, the Blunderers (named after a member of the hockey team), is named for Saint Leonard.\n\n\nIn 2011, an attempt was made to rename Saint Leonard to Leonard, so some of the other alumni of the school might have a better idea of what the school really means to them. Noted alumni Tom Kelly, Joe Nieuwendyk and Joe Finley all supported Saint Leonard's request, the request was supported by various alumni, and the university was able to find a sponsor to help pay for the name change.

{"id":1329,"ended":true,"length":354,"gen_text":"After the financially successful release of The Rise of Cobra, Rob Moore, the studio vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, stated in 2009 that a sequel would be developed. In January 2011, producer Michael Bay was in the thick of production on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, when he was asked about a sequel to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nIn a 2008 interview, Bay talked about the sequel.\n\n\"I'd probably do it after [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II]. I think it's about 10 or 11 years too late.\"\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of bringing back the turtles, Bay stated that the story would have to change drastically.\n\n\"It would probably have to be different,\" Bay explained. \"The universe they're in... If you do a sequel, it's kind of the same old story. I think it would probably have to be a little less than a sequel. There would have to be some new and different elements.\"\n\nBay, who also directed the first film, has stated that a second TMNT movie would not be as easy to adapt as the first film.\n\n\"Not really. A sequel's not as easy as the first one,\" Bay said. \"We had some really interesting designs for it. [The new Turtles] would have to feel very different, which probably makes them a little dangerous now that they've been around for a while.\"\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time is the second TMNT movie to be directed by Bay. The first film was released in 1997 and grossed over $300 million worldwide. Fans have speculated that a sequel could include the use of the Foot Clan, as well, and a crossover movie would be expected.\n\nFans are encouraged to leave comments on this article at myspace.com\/deamonnyturtles or on myspace.com\/rob-moore.","token_len":388,"entropy":[1.9443,12.6581,2.5692,3.469,0.0504,2.7727,6.6939,0.8233,5.7203,0.8182,6.9309,5.4484,2.7689,1.7646,4.6234,6.3446,3.6595,2.9506,4.2932,0.6408,0.2621,5.0572,2.3743,6.1324,0.6435,4.2249,0.7415,2.1761,0.6284,5.1194,1.2651,3.2036,3.8494,1.9171,0.2422,4.5989,2.7434,0.3524,3.1006,4.9192,1.8666,5.6183,0.002,3.2626,0.4724,4.1739,0.002,0.0003,0.0006,0.0019,1.5612,0.0155,0.0051,0.0029,0.0011,0.7711,3.8937,1.4041,1.7785,1.5813,1.0211,0.8825,0.8401,1.1794,3.0618,0.0004,0.0005,0.0009,0.0013,1.4912,1.9698,0.0009,3.2497,1.9378,5.2927,0.1355,1.17,0.5685,5.5012,0.0954,1.0734,2.4877,2.2521,1.1869,0.0002,0.466,1.2266,3.0437,5.2761,1.5791,0.958,5.4509,3.2605,1.8071,0.0007,0.0038,0.0016,0.0016,1.1167,1.2084,1.0071,2.0899,1.2944,0.9641,4.6857,5.7124,3.0457,1.6725,0.1779,2.3288,0.3729,2.9381,0.2411,0.0002,4.2951,0.3,1.2368,1.0638,1.746,0.1155,4.8223,0.5159,1.2722,1.5853,0.9114,0.346,2.3459,1.3897,2.1734,3.0412,1.375,1.4282,0.053,1.9908,3.6187,0.731,0.4015,0.0002,0.1165,2.268,1.2211,2.9452,0.7572,0.0147,0.4405,3.101,2.7368,1.1193,3.4743,0.1724,0.0731,2.5079,6.4884,4.8897,1.4629,0.2481,5.8979,5.1506,1.2676,3.5979,1.1824,0.6059,0.9923,1.3156,0.9455,3.2944,0.0026,2.8856,0.3568,4.449,0.9508,0.7559,2.1016,1.5512,1.217,0.6177,2.5713,0.8939,0.0104,0.2471,1.0969,4.0094,4.9441,4.1422,1.5071,0.6063,1.3332,3.8263,2.1142,0.519,0.0043,0.0094,1.4134,1.9045,5.3928,0.8458,1.5767,1.7417,0.0784,0.0002,2.2889,4.8498,0.9981,2.485,1.155,0.4326,0.8382,1.4763,0.1786,2.3809,1.9997,0.4715,3.1449,3.4391,3.6079,0.0001,1.1706,0.8836,2.0285,0.5256,3.9073,4.5264,0.9895,3.1939,0.8308,0.352,0.1376,0.8485,0.5492,0.622,0.0002,0.2424,5.706,3.071,1.1903,4.9025,0.7734,2.7364,2.3104,2.168,0.2505,0.5202,1.5872,0.0882,0.4318,1.3945,0.5497,0.8544,0.5061,0.1511,3.7708,1.5407,3.7435,3.0694,4.3122,5.6716,1.0129,1.9077,1.2622,4.5336,1.484,4.5282,1.0684,0.1033,1.7148,0.768,0.282,5.4243,1.8049,0.3094,2.4099,3.6592,4.8479,3.0325,2.1019,1.4986,0.1677,6.6784,6.512,2.197,0.516,1.3286,1.5912,1.6151,0.7955,1.091,0.4528,0.853,0.0798,0.0002,3.1842,0.0021,0.0018,0.0005,0.0051,1.0224,5.3429,0.0782,0.0037,1.5593,2.3529,1.8013,3.7826,0.0003,0.8269,1.0367,0.3168,3.4727,0.0164,0.2875,0.6228,0.6153,0.2233,1.9819,0.534,2.3996,0.2558,3.4504,1.0899,2.2261,0.0004,1.2485,0.0577,2.4475,0.0157,0.7186,0.2204,6.3843,1.3171,2.8866,0.3466,1.2797,1.1271,1.4515,3.8421,1.3307,5.6493,0.0058,0.9216,2.8089,0.0561,1.3545,2.148,1.9653,5.2312,2.4709,3.4713,4.3514,2.5174,2.7875,0.7777,5.1012,0.8502,0.5117,0.0002,4.6226,2.867,4.1887,0.0092,3.268,0.806,1.0836,1.248,0.998,4.064,5.2801,3.3333,0.1035,0.0177,0.2924,6.111,4.0649,4.119,0.969,0.2857,3.1524,1.294,1.2002,0.6093,0.0125,0.0012,0.0286,4.4271,2.7072,0.3507,0.0199,0.8147]}

We have another two days of rehearsing right now and before then [we] have to see what we can do on the new songs and where we are at creatively. We actually finished up the last new track, the one we're mixing now so that should be coming out right away. The new one sounded much better for us than we've done our last songs. A couple of weeks ago we played it for ourselves and we were a little more pleased with it then the group and the audience was. That was the first time we can remember that really feeling good about it and that's what we're looking to do with our new record. We want to show everyone that this is some of the best music we've ever made. We want to make this record our best.

{"id":1711,"ended":true,"length":367,"gen_text":"Chicago @ - @ based singer @ - @ songwriter Rickey Allen pushed allegations that `` Cater 2 U `` was inspired by a song he had composed with the same title and spelling, but never recorded. His song `` Don't Say I Don't Love You `` was popular because of its unusual melody. A former employee of @ - @ -'s management in the late 1970\ufffds told me he once witnessed `` Cater 2 U'' being tested during a rehearsal before a session and when the song was played, the singer and lead guitarist, Jerry Adkins looked at each other with surprise, and the group began strumming together. The person said the singer told them `` There's a hook, I know it'' but said it was hard to hit, with Adkins adding, `` There's a hook, I betcha.`` @ - @ -'s former secretary told me he had observed some of the sessions and heard the lyricist use the word ``silly and silly'' about half the time, and there was one occasion when the singer used `` Silly and silly `` during the second chorus.`` '' This may be the most damning evidence of `` Cater 2 U ``'s inspiration. As described by the former employee, `` The singer and lead guitarist (Adkins) would often use `Oh, s'all be so jealous of me' as the chorus.... ``The lyrics were so bizarre,.. we were forced to go outside and try to find something that we could work the words into.... When we could get the lyrics to work together, Jerry played the notes, while Rickey played the accompaniment.'' Here's a clue to how Adkins must have heard \"Cater 2 U\". He was on trial after he was accused of raping a female employee at the offices of @ - @ -'s Management in Miami Beach, Florida. The prosecution is now considering whether to charge him with sexual assault.","token_len":390,"entropy":[8.2488,7.5904,8.1773,12.6575,10.0564,4.6932,5.0256,0.5631,4.5838,0.2461,12.0923,1.6908,6.8694,12.5903,12.4806,2.1266,11.2555,18.3282,10.1253,4.3536,3.0349,1.1154,5.2279,0.0665,1.9347,3.3615,1.8294,3.5966,3.9552,3.4606,2.8447,3.8722,1.0339,3.4035,8.9482,2.445,1.7553,5.6736,2.7324,0.4378,4.7328,3.9279,2.138,5.8003,0.1512,4.7659,2.832,2.626,0.0049,0.32,0.0261,0.3187,0.9253,5.367,5.6393,1.2023,0.5855,5.4064,2.7656,1.1421,3.9394,5.2071,2.9138,0.8216,4.7008,0.6624,0.0373,1.7184,8.729,0.0478,4.8072,4.9662,1.5918,1.6975,1.2117,5.1027,0.0126,1.8907,2.48,2.7775,4.143,2.886,3.563,0.6428,0.0282,0.0307,4.3428,0.7887,5.7182,4.7463,0.7103,2.5169,4.5653,1.0235,4.2772,4.517,4.7315,1.1345,1.5352,0.4281,1.0495,0.8624,1.1532,2.126,3.7239,5.101,0.9052,2.7338,5.5438,5.2577,3.4289,7.1871,1.1677,0.1807,0.0042,2.4284,3.015,2.0775,2.7779,1.6388,5.0777,3.2454,5.9604,0.0347,0.0016,5.0616,1.1076,1.5066,5.1989,1.6378,1.2628,1.1528,2.8953,3.904,2.0617,5.6906,0.764,1.5645,5.6428,2.7602,2.8298,2.6113,0.644,4.9443,3.7755,4.6032,2.116,0.8355,5.6372,0.116,5.4579,3.258,5.96,2.9502,0.0023,2.9093,1.1793,0.0151,4.1434,0.2186,0.7938,0.7669,0.2375,0.3246,6.6711,3.5007,4.1151,5.1044,3.2077,0.1112,0.4624,0.8912,1.933,0.0058,3.5535,4.8724,1.8878,0.1456,2.2022,1.9012,5.4936,4.8681,1.1522,0.528,4.9064,1.9033,2.9505,1.058,6.144,0.4158,3.5782,0.8218,1.0201,0.0657,4.6729,4.3015,5.8766,1.3055,0.4962,3.8987,2.7014,0.4061,0.1684,1.8193,1.0551,5.8263,0.8097,3.3239,3.0347,0.4227,1.2606,0.5757,2.415,1.2891,4.8323,0.099,0.8832,0.2435,2.2602,3.2197,1.3886,4.5872,2.253,0.6343,8.4489,4.7047,6.0221,5.689,0.8734,1.5091,2.2965,4.6278,1.412,1.9032,4.4315,0.4668,0.0189,0.0252,1.6972,2.8749,0.0171,2.6999,0.9117,4.717,5.028,1.2661,1.4383,1.393,0.5336,0.3088,0.6632,2.516,2.1627,1.808,1.1606,0.1015,4.9963,0.8695,0.0013,0.0776,1.5864,2.9802,3.2925,3.5178,6.7933,0.6403,2.6352,3.6309,3.0121,3.9841,2.3543,5.6604,1.3373,0.5548,1.2934,2.1992,1.4266,1.7386,7.6061,3.3746,4.2277,2.4666,1.4684,2.7634,3.9799,1.4536,12.0503,5.7094,2.4241,5.0332,0.0326,3.9062,3.8305,1.2369,3.7266,0.3047,2.3138,2.5944,1.4776,3.1922,0.3722,4.4791,6.0554,1.238,0.3794,3.5384,4.7147,1.0445,3.6363,3.347,1.414,1.0112,2.0894,0.8394,4.7696,0.2813,4.9362,4.8973,1.1015,5.5322,2.3385,3.3562,1.8043,0.0017,1.3682,0.1729,5.1014,0.135,2.9448,5.6937,1.9308,1.3693,5.3279,1.5155,2.7396,3.9993,0.003,4.1869,0.1371,2.7539,4.0079,0.8974,0.0308,0.0177,0.0522,3.0943,2.2434,1.6039,3.7849,7.0843,6.248,2.6952,1.2071,1.0892,0.0759,2.6107,0.5935,2.9624,1.6494,1.6486,1.4466,5.6503,0.0781,1.4662,0.0311,0.0658,0.3289,1.5511,0.0104,4.3065,1.3021,5.449,0.8332,0.7315,0.3268,0.5439,1.6853,3.1687,6.0346,3.2557,3.539,0.9738,0.4352,3.3479,1.5823,0.1238,2.5214,1.3303,1.3349]}

The Hummelfjell Accident killed the pilot and one passenger.\n\nThe aircraft was recovered by the Navy and on 1 February 1956 was sold for scrapping. In November 1956 the aircraft was purchased by the Dutch Warbird Museum to be put on display as part of the Warbird Collection.\n\nThe original German Luftwaffe markings were not restored when the aircraft was transferred to the Netherlands and the museum applied for a special airframe identification certificate ( AOC ); the registration was changed to the N959. On 11 December 2004, the Dutch Warbird Museum received the certificate from the European civil aviation authority ( ECAI) which was the final step in restoring the Luftwaffe markings.\n\nThe aircraft was restored in Germany, completed in 2006 and was flown with the Netherlands Air Force between 2008 and 2013 during the Luftwaffe Heritage Campaign. On 26 May 2013, there was a memorial service for the aircraft.\n\nThe aircraft remained on the Museum grounds until September 2014 when it was moved to a separate hangar in Dordrecht.\n\nOn 20 April 2015, the aircraft was transferred to the United Kingdom ( UK ) as a part of the sale of the Netherlands Air Force's warbirds. On 3 May 2015, the aircraft was presented to the UK as a \"Luftwaffe Historic Flying Collection\" and entered the National Air Museum collection on 7 May. See also the section on the UK.\n\nIn October 2016 the Museum decided that it will not be possible to restore the Warbird Museum's aircraft in time for the museum's 20th anniversary, and as a result the Warbird N959 is to be sold for scrap.\n\nLikes: 2,546 Comments: 3 | Favs: 0","token_len":391,"entropy":[7.8439,3.0678,6.5382,0.3112,1.3927,10.2537,3.0613,6.1893,3.3482,13.9785,7.3042,10.7386,6.9931,9.6242,2.3282,1.7689,14.1866,13.6563,3.2911,10.2608,1.8513,5.1597,0.1177,4.6465,5.2545,2.1141,3.6407,2.2247,4.5224,6.5775,3.8255,0.869,1.0941,13.2358,0.1367,0.1434,0.0072,0.0761,7.5513,0.0042,12.4554,2.5478,1.1643,0.9994,3.4001,0.5201,0.4545,1.3397,0.0107,1.8645,2.17,0.8384,5.0739,1.9188,1.0438,4.1774,1.4529,4.612,3.6476,2.4723,4.1023,1.1468,3.6572,2.2083,2.3875,0.0072,0.9547,4.0893,3.9348,1.3765,1.1571,0.7125,0.1318,3.2627,0.1562,0.9555,4.8994,5.541,2.2877,1.2866,5.5879,0.5362,3.2139,0.1921,0.1842,3.2395,1.7659,0.006,0.8995,3.5768,0.2765,2.3594,0.621,1.0844,0.0002,1.5915,4.9041,5.4698,4.3824,0.0007,0.0697,0.0044,1.4343,0.7295,3.7534,2.9819,3.4108,0.2769,0.3743,0.2061,2.9922,0.2037,0.2333,1.0991,1.9864,1.3415,5.4588,4.9053,1.7996,0.9225,4.0553,5.4037,4.3342,2.9305,1.9946,1.8392,5.842,4.0128,7.4397,1.4776,4.4306,1.1181,2.6161,0.248,3.0865,3.5186,3.2717,4.305,4.0829,3.2133,3.5839,2.2696,4.6352,1.4629,0.3795,2.8866,0.8534,0.0413,0.0653,2.2812,1.3907,2.0061,1.8689,0.1074,5.0084,6.314,0.0742,0.216,1.0454,1.2035,0.6568,3.5392,3.2382,2.6185,3.5071,3.3568,1.2716,0.2979,1.2744,1.6585,0.0788,2.0217,0.0003,0.003,0.0005,0.2974,0.547,0.9287,0.0002,1.2406,0.8428,0.6352,2.8479,2.2138,5.2837,2.9023,4.6105,1.0095,2.54,0.7859,2.5584,2.6717,4.9173,0.6298,3.4779,1.3533,0.0613,4.1927,2.555,0.1103,2.4007,5.3463,1.6416,5.2948,0.0012,0.0148,0.0004,2.5233,3.727,0.4687,2.5785,3.8341,2.2444,1.0093,0.7619,7.7574,0.3414,0.4234,3.8513,0.1783,0.9575,0.2134,2.0106,2.1034,0.7208,0.0002,1.4269,0.923,4.5857,2.0838,3.1128,3.2978,4.1788,0.4939,3.5241,1.5673,0.6648,0.3064,0.1317,1.011,0.094,2.0965,5.6602,2.2279,2.4068,5.047,0.3486,0.0053,0.0006,0.5797,1.3908,0.0002,1.3743,3.3557,2.5837,0.701,0.4817,0.362,0.9351,0.2582,2.6537,0.1788,0.3523,5.3658,1.2745,3.2027,3.7943,0.2673,2.5439,1.2016,1.9876,0.002,0.3584,4.9604,0.0907,0.7244,4.7631,1.708,0.0699,2.9195,4.0185,0.6773,0.6517,1.9088,3.8827,1.1604,0.1995,0.2875,0.2934,0.2709,0.2918,4.8395,0.4591,0.2495,2.0497,3.7066,1.0797,4.5097,5.684,0.0009,0.0418,0.0025,4.1341,1.572,3.7679,0.5342,1.6258,4.8897,1.4085,2.2874,0.3088,0.332,2.6099,2.2946,3.1914,0.7253,2.6774,7.6142,1.6345,1.3638,5.2695,0.8114,0.6661,1.4915,4.4565,0.2504,0.0002,2.1479,2.7112,1.4153,1.4717,3.2899,3.8198,3.0558,1.3016,3.4017,1.5931,1.5808,0.8686,0.0574,0.8479,0.1549,5.3583,0.0664,2.8623,0.9196,1.5525,2.8368,1.4464,0.2569,0.3717,4.7977,0.0621,3.3626,0.1125,0.2791,2.7321,1.3733,3.7998,0.5737,0.0867,0.6466,2.2953,0.0176,9.1368,0.0213,0.021,1.9966,2.1195,0.0564,1.4489,3.3467,0.3771,0.5386,0.83,0.0002,5.6676,4.9528,2.0106,2.4408,1.7238,4.3531,2.4181,0.071,3.0073,4.1964,7.1241,0.0004,0.0005,2.7796]}

A special commission was created to examine the laws and to consider whether secession laws were constitutional or could be repealed.\n\nOn June 10, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued Executive Order No. 10.\n\nIt authorized the appointment of 10 commissioners to prepare a report that would give the country a \"correct and complete history of West Virginia, including the origin of the people who were now the members of the State.\"\n\nIn October, West Virginia's legislature voted 4 to 3 against secession, which is the first known unanimous vote in a state legislature against secession. Although the majority in the legislature was against secession, it was a vote for separation that had the largest number of votes than any other measure. As part of the process of getting a complete history of West Virginia, the ten commissioners interviewed the key leaders of the time.\n\nAmong those interviewed was George B.

He said:\n\n...there had been such a wide separation of sentiment, and such a general feeling of wrong on both sides that it was a perfect thing to put these things right as they had never been right before.\n\nAfter hearing Walvoord's opinions, he declared, \"Heaven send that boy a medal, then and there the Union is right, you're right, and we're wrong!\"\n\nLincoln then assigned the commissioners to compile a comprehensive history of West Virginia, and to determine if the state's laws were in violation of federal law.","token_len":394,"entropy":[0.3953,9.8059,2.2057,0.8999,10.1047,0.306,1.4997,4.2236,2.9367,5.0306,0.049,1.7937,0.0389,9.2026,13.5504,9.4591,5.6538,7.4042,5.4091,2.7646,5.7155,1.1567,5.1044,10.1245,2.8064,1.9853,2.8376,0.3271,0.7659,0.4071,0.1908,1.5807,2.5276,0.289,1.7645,0.0054,3.0421,4.4926,2.3173,6.3415,1.9303,1.9315,0.0031,0.5025,4.8387,0.0218,1.6264,0.543,5.2265,2.2315,5.3709,2.2196,0.0529,5.7496,0.003,1.1244,0.0857,1.164,3.8206,5.3981,1.6727,0.6955,2.1079,0.4403,4.2385,0.4471,5.5038,1.6167,6.03,3.4204,2.6754,3.9971,2.982,1.6989,1.7775,2.6761,5.3594,0.085,2.2763,0.2775,1.6057,0.0002,2.2784,3.7679,3.5429,0.0369,0.4394,0.0645,3.7412,0.7501,0.001,0.9791,2.583,0.0119,0.416,0.0026,0.9394,3.6288,3.9764,0.0002,2.3267,3.0322,0.5128,4.4491,0.0457,5.8848,0.5394,0.4778,4.0939,0.4515,0.9301,3.4161,0.3638,4.4076,1.1343,4.5012,0.9517,2.2042,3.5956,1.3943,1.0416,2.6872,0.2736,5.3859,0.014,2.1551,2.5525,1.0893,3.0483,1.0055,0.7014,3.5832,3.5545,3.9137,3.9141,3.3856,5.8083,0.0932,0.352,0.6842,1.0115,0.2723,0.0002,3.2071,3.7307,0.2414,3.976,0.0372,1.1861,1.7836,2.2442,6.5022,1.6009,1.6663,3.256,0.8635,1.6152,3.5908,4.7513,1.8136,1.8373,3.5959,5.4219,0.3432,1.1606,2.0049,0.448,0.6632,0.6943,0.2685,0.1095,6.6231,1.0682,4.3148,3.2514,0.3985,0.7448,1.4397,2.159,0.113,0.0389,2.4766,0.6741,2.2813,3.4285,2.1343,3.3706,2.9601,4.4948,1.8086,4.002,1.6878,0.0217,0.8078,7.338,0.3671,0.3386,3.6338,0.9422,6.2055,4.7146,0.0016,0.4641,2.7643,0.8603,5.0973,2.5044,3.8116,0.2834,0.4693,0.4036,0.0128,0.1787,0.4739,6.8298,0.0357,4.1052,3.9869,5.7873,2.9355,0.6403,0.2788,4.1198,1.7113,0.5728,0.0002,4.3268,1.9469,0.1781,1.2624,3.5811,3.1547,0.1469,6.051,1.2807,0.0003,0.289,1.1435,4.2395,1.8209,4.425,4.3009,5.2091,1.6469,3.1951,1.6256,0.4588,1.7722,4.4,2.6608,4.1614,5.6386,0.6867,1.7409,0.0002,0.0007,3.2951,1.4372,4.2098,3.1922,0.8966,2.8044,0.0323,5.7821,3.0865,0.9721,1.7444,1.5264,0.6694,4.3071,1.3625,1.1403,4.5802,1.02,3.6868,0.1856,0.2699,1.5623,1.4531,2.9554,0.3456,0.0002,5.9965,4.0488,4.2976,0.383,4.1139,0.9195,5.7476,3.5837,0.8638,1.6035,2.4206,1.6174,0.8166,0.6125,3.5625,1.7098,0.675,4.6978,3.2847,1.3532,0.0188,2.0182,2.0675,0.6798,3.0906,5.6969,3.393,0.9668,4.4027,3.5344,1.9859,1.5583,4.746,2.0518,2.3824,3.1558,0.0493,1.3149,0.4941,0.4108,0.8777,0.0001,3.7716,3.6147,2.052,0.0003,0.0004,0.2688,4.2093,0.1975,5.4978,4.5425,2.296,0.135,5.5773,3.2227,5.3241,3.1559,4.1743,0.91,4.0702,2.6493,5.4455,2.2826,0.1085,6.4823,3.7571,2.0037,2.4474,2.4602,5.7248,2.9029,0.838,0.7679,0.5419,1.5144,0.1886,0.7179,2.2057,0.2684,0.0001,5.2924,0.089,3.4682,5.3612,1.1979,0.6356,0.2,3.1387,0.2969,3.4727,0.3573,0.1384,0.3086,0.0065,1.6128,2.9038,2.1286,4.2301,1.8667,1.0171,0.8615,1.6097,1.9685,1.3161,2.4488,1.3729,0.0118,2.4708,0.374,0.2558]}

{"id":1891,"ended":true,"length":389,"gen_text":"The effectiveness of condoms, as of most forms of contraception, can be assessed two ways. Perfect use or method effectiveness rates only include people who use condoms properly and consistently. Actual effectiveness rates consider the size of the population to be tested, the method of contraception used, and other factors. These rates have been reported in various ways. Generally, the method effectiveness rate is the proportion of couples using a method that have an unintended pregnancy within three months of condom use. For instance, when the proportion of couples using a barrier method is high, it's usually because condoms have greater protection against pregnancy than other forms of contraception, such as the pill. On the other hand, using condoms every time will be less beneficial because it's more difficult for a woman to remember to use one each time she has sexual contact with her boyfriends. Condom effectiveness rates can be calculated in another manner, called average method effectiveness, where the method effectiveness rate is the proportion of couples using a method that have an unintended pregnancy within three months of using it. The average method effectiveness rate is higher than the ideal method effectiveness rate because it takes into account other factors. Also, while a contraceptive method is considered effective if there's not a single unintended pregnancy, not every method is created equal in achieving that effectiveness. For example, a contraceptive may be more effective against gonorrhea than it is against pregnancy (the method success ratio ). In practice, the best method may be the one that couples use best, and each woman is different. If a couple is having unprotected sex and each woman is using a more effective method, any additional pregnancies that result from these unplanned partners are less likely to be a result of the use of condoms.\n\nOther factors, including a woman's weight, age, number of sexual partners in the past year, and time at the beginning of the relationship, may affect a woman's ability to use a condom correctly or consistently, especially if she's already been sexually active.","token_len":395,"entropy":[9.5507,0.1005,7.8506,2.9999,3.2338,5.2201,6.3319,5.4791,0.1968,1.0824,0.0894,3.866,0.5486,4.6242,7.9408,0.1576,0.9767,11.6343,0.4833,4.5775,7.4687,2.0251,4.7782,8.8433,4.1752,1.8636,0.2539,1.1178,1.9882,4.6069,1.9898,0.4743,0.6764,7.0548,1.25,0.6114,3.9588,1.6056,5.2548,0.2755,0.3027,1.0178,3.4165,0.9558,3.2878,1.1932,0.8442,3.4683,1.6671,0.7207,0.6487,0.3772,0.4411,1.9265,0.2974,0.5733,4.0106,1.7189,3.6555,0.6903,3.0962,1.5303,2.6405,1.318,1.5429,6.0992,0.2382,1.3995,2.8,0.5599,0.542,0.6047,0.92,1.8118,0.0124,2.9528,1.8641,0.9724,1.1741,2.4376,3.3779,1.6838,1.8659,0.0079,3.0991,4.1037,1.5819,0.5403,4.9497,0.1454,0.461,2.8262,2.5332,0.0114,4.0429,1.6344,2.836,0.0785,0.7863,0.4044,1.3262,3.8798,0.0627,1.2564,4.5959,0.4972,3.5534,3.0301,3.1158,0.9166,4.3265,2.6428,5.9382,5.5779,1.3071,0.8606,0.2705,0.2673,2.5168,0.0139,0.2383,2.4871,1.1262,0.0013,1.5087,0.591,1.131,4.1506,0.0221,0.0389,0.0302,0.0053,4.652,1.9148,4.881,0.172,3.8962,3.2197,1.0976,7.5114,3.217,1.4753,1.9645,1.6688,1.3158,1.6177,1.1529,0.7876,0.0685,1.7716,0.1552,0.3543,3.1488,2.6003,0.1216,0.7191,0.2965,3.2163,2.7311,1.1869,1.0817,4.5211,4.1625,0.4952,5.2298,0.2811,0.6431,0.4697,2.0001,0.9607,1.6127,2.5203,6.2011,3.5443,1.2616,2.03,6.1705,0.6617,0.0499,1.794,2.9507,0.6501,1.5384,0.2761,0.3016,0.3038,0.6148,0.4847,0.012,0.8755,0.7924,0.3259,0.2674,0.1731,0.3397,0.0816,0.0315,0.0037,0.1348,0.3366,0.0068,0.1275,1.706,1.3055,0.1986,2.2929,1.7283,0.124,0.0108,0.1226,0.9228,2.5788,0.5997,0.2326,3.9826,0.3684,0.0506,0.0865,0.5427,1.1939,1.9672,0.1183,0.1012,2.8441,0.2402,2.5443,5.879,0.0442,4.6292,2.729,3.9191,0.5446,1.6223,2.5466,1.148,1.0425,3.6606,1.5194,3.8337,0.6475,0.2391,0.7508,0.0197,1.9642,4.8573,1.3875,0.7666,0.3375,4.5506,0.1875,2.441,5.0176,2.0627,6.2848,0.2408,1.6758,1.2904,0.0045,2.385,1.7398,3.5933,0.5597,1.7959,0.1117,3.6131,7.1645,0.0049,0.0003,0.7041,1.7907,0.0438,0.1064,2.7493,4.291,3.1713,3.137,6.5992,4.1817,6.6654,2.9539,5.5049,0.0294,1.6304,3.2036,1.2008,2.6425,1.0105,2.205,0.3296,0.4451,3.6027,1.3972,3.6344,1.6748,2.3111,5.5353,2.5078,3.1793,1.5549,0.4049,4.0654,1.1789,1.8939,1.751,2.0196,1.2503,0.1335,1.6501,4.1797,0.6856,0.9779,0.9567,0.4708,4.7033,0.0727,0.4137,0.7432,6.526,3.5907,0.884,1.552,0.7766,1.4343,3.5078,5.47,0.0329,7.0439,1.6346,2.6775,0.4911,0.1614,0.525,3.5676,1.8796,0.0047,0.763,3.9305,0.0076,3.1385,0.9191,1.374,0.0048,4.7141,1.8855,2.7443,2.6122,2.8473,0.4825,0.0109,3.8327,0.5557,1.4819,0.0764,4.4154,0.019,1.0079,0.0083,2.5329,0.2592,0.5323,0.6868,0.0592,0.6348,5.4556,5.8376,1.983,1.6877,0.3065,1.5108,0.218,0.5661,1.9999,0.9411,2.1461,0.4123,0.002,0.7501,0.0228,1.1659,0.7065,1.2978,1.7229,1.9511,0.1274,3.0149,3.1175,0.989,0.5857,0.9532,3.3539,1.4768,0.6941,0.0064,0.354]}

The short-term findings were generally positive, since some compounds may induce a positive mood change, which is followed by long-term psychological damage. For instance, a study in Germany has indicated that long-term use of kratom ( Mitragyna speciosa ) could induce moderate and long-term depression. As far as there is so far no consensus, it seems that at least some k @ - k's induce positive mood changes, which are followed by long-term psychological damage. It is worth mentioning that the short-term mood change induced @ - by some k @ - k's (e.g., Mitragyna speciosa, which is currently on Schedule 1 in the USA) may prove to be short term, whereas the long term effects are still un @ - proven. On the other hand, it has been shown that most k @ - k's induce short-term anxiety and even depression, which are followed by long-term psychological damage. It has also been described how some k @ - k's induce a euphoric effect, and how some may induce a long distance memory transfer. One study suggested that all substances induce a cognitive enhancement effect, but how this may be manifested in the long term is still yet undetermined.","token_len":395,"entropy":[10.2587,7.2605,3.1757,5.7205,7.1929,8.5255,0.2151,5.8038,1.4499,0.0045,0.8427,5.1548,17.4524,6.3645,10.2125,6.5892,8.4946,0.8872,10.0621,0.9468,0.1074,0.0002,0.0003,2.0214,2.6436,1.5527,3.8685,1.3461,4.0472,14.0012,3.4816,0.3116,3.6073,0.3445,4.5274,9.4728,7.0473,0.0452,1.3852,11.2789,12.6012,0.5682,4.3581,5.4651,0.4507,0.3719,4.1836,0.3507,6.121,2.0672,1.3571,5.9784,0.0209,0.4623,1.1715,4.1942,3.5453,2.2049,3.0351,8.3888,0.3873,0.6019,5.3016,3.5043,3.4047,2.6133,0.0105,0.3255,4.139,3.6039,5.8994,1.7747,5.148,0.1363,0.3544,0.847,2.6093,0.2673,3.1927,1.5746,5.4755,0.8814,6.3287,3.0941,0.9236,5.3501,3.4611,0.1933,0.3011,1.5043,0.8525,4.452,1.6493,0.0111,1.0711,0.7632,2.4018,0.3549,2.861,2.5572,0.6915,1.7721,1.5163,0.2118,1.1284,5.2508,2.4149,2.7893,1.6566,4.9652,0.6791,0.8075,2.7579,1.6735,0.4592,0.0011,0.0714,1.5445,0.8185,1.3997,5.3054,0.0302,5.2728,1.7285,2.9066,2.7218,0.0691,3.9671,1.8079,1.409,2.3353,0.4576,0.3017,3.7377,2.7258,1.2268,3.4719,0.0695,4.6714,1.8395,0.877,2.884,3.883,0.4863,0.2071,6.9092,5.2237,3.9739,2.4276,1.0861,6.4895,2.7551,5.0978,2.9188,1.326,2.3712,2.9665,0.646,3.4794,1.779,4.328,1.9616,5.7377,0.0996,3.5168,0.285,0.1461,5.1542,4.5036,0.6574,4.1864,1.8519,0.0942,2.6106,1.3603,2.6119,4.2012,3.1346,4.3858,0.1359,2.6923,0.4746,0.0454,1.1195,0.097,2.0489,0.8883,1.8299,6.0742,0.0072,0.013,0.022,0.0,0.0008,0.2511,3.9601,1.7726,6.1643,4.3465,1.265,0.1168,0.3694,3.0073,1.3758,4.8571,2.967,0.0916,5.823,0.5264,3.3343,0.0033,0.3144,1.0977,1.1307,1.8205,1.9334,1.0849,4.7631,0.4904,1.3831,1.5322,0.1895,0.0014,0.0556,0.1568,3.6182,2.2314,0.4389,0.5712,1.3536,1.3211,1.5452,0.1118,0.0258,0.7906,0.1029,0.0293,0.1837,0.0727,0.287,3.2392,0.5668,3.4418,1.4324,0.2459,2.1517,3.4587,0.1118,0.1425,2.0763,2.658,1.2485,6.5012,0.021,2.3249,1.6123,0.2915,0.0702,0.0019,0.0188,0.0636,3.8949,1.6882,0.0036,0.0083,1.3584,2.3927,0.0036,0.0274,0.0739,0.0001,0.0005,4.7985,5.0735,1.3379,4.3314,3.5855,1.8256,1.3611,0.9726,0.5144,1.0504,0.3384,1.3159,6.6266,0.5933,0.0516,2.9701,2.8577,1.6459,2.7407,0.6547,0.2673,1.8072,1.1883,2.3903,2.5091,4.7592,4.2477,0.0058,2.5144,0.2718,4.8669,0.1395,0.121,0.0168,0.0382,2.5011,2.2707,0.4021,1.7705,0.2359,5.3745,0.9112,0.0636,0.0012,0.0287,0.0566,2.039,2.2946,0.2449,0.0456,4.703,1.6519,4.8775,2.5261,1.0677,1.1532,1.7745,0.3042,0.0364,0.2363,0.162,0.0204,0.149,0.0516,0.3121,2.7123,2.4864,1.7398,0.0263,6.6976,3.0455,1.3947,0.3909,0.0264,0.0009,0.0128,0.0517,1.1787,1.9627,3.9319,0.2341,2.4305,0.9502,3.4764,2.47,1.8525,2.0475,0.3079,0.9377,4.3112,9.444,3.376,5.4415,1.4436,4.5637,1.4954,3.5667,0.109,4.6831,4.3409,1.5359,1.631,4.9776,1.2007,1.1417,0.8441,2.0303,4.5532,2.1678,2.317,0.7855,3.9758,1.7796,1.2379,1.2641,0.4086,0.7683,1.0032,4.0186,4.5638,0.2131,0.1123]}
{"id":3854,"ended":false,"length":371,"gen_text":"The first Eagles Boys store opened in Albury, New South Wales in 1987, a venture spearheaded by businessman Tom Potter in partnership with his mother, Barbara Potter, who guaranteed a $1 million line of credit in the store's first six months. The venture failed, however because of financial difficulties. Eventually, the Albury factory was shipped to Melbourne and the store moved to Flinders Street Station, but once again it failed.\nWith the help of Harry Gulliver and others, the Eagles Boys Ltd. was revived and the store now had a much richer heritage and wider presence. The store became the centre of retail shopping for the Albury and surrounding area, with more than 200 stores including The Eagles Club, The Eagles Sport Shop, The Eagles Club & Sports Shop, Aussie Boys Vintage Shoe Shop and a range of lifestyle accessories.\nWhile the store's success has allowed it to grow, some challenges have also encountered them, most notably the closure of some Eagle Clubs and the development of the adjacent suburb, Albury-Wodonga, north-west of Brisbane, where some of the other retailers have also recently closed. Also, while in Albury the store continues to receive some visitors as it remains one of the last independent Eagle Clubs in Australian retail, but there were no members last night, the owner said.\nTom Potter, who also lives in Albury, has developed a strong following through the Eagles Boys stores throughout Australia, working closely with local football clubs and players.\nMr Potter said today the business had survived by being very customer-oriented and by always having stock available.\n\"We look at each store like a business-run and managed by a director,\" he said. \"We give our staff a contract by which they must work on our behalf, as managers. I feel very strongly at my responsibility to serve our customers in the best ways I can. I have never wanted to do anything to offend them, or to damage them.\"","token_len":396,"entropy":[4.145,12.3616,11.6559,8.3233,0.6638,0.3086,7.4803,4.6556,1.1916,1.2118,0.0044,0.0002,1.4056,4.225,1.5754,4.4304,7.3408,4.6337,0.0132,6.4984,5.16,7.9317,4.6258,1.8918,0.0015,2.1253,4.5624,0.9678,4.784,2.2939,1.9443,1.368,11.7989,1.6664,2.2884,1.91,0.59,4.2736,0.0155,0.0137,3.9366,1.6819,2.2543,0.7054,0.7912,4.2487,0.1733,0.3746,1.8425,4.5187,3.0647,0.9456,1.3791,9.0784,1.2142,3.6463,1.058,1.448,5.448,0.4014,1.2451,3.5937,0.0096,7.5102,1.2674,6.2468,0.3791,2.1825,1.5628,1.0379,2.0297,1.8266,0.3513,5.7838,0.001,0.3291,1.3261,1.8405,3.0918,6.0388,0.2386,2.054,0.7858,1.1437,0.7952,12.1183,1.0632,3.0111,0.004,3.8107,5.5478,3.6212,1.3616,2.1084,4.3644,0.2368,1.0204,4.1895,0.2445,6.2941,1.2429,1.2372,2.6903,2.0269,1.6755,1.7497,4.4743,2.8391,0.5752,3.8473,6.2613,3.7795,2.3172,5.779,5.5737,0.8337,1.7026,1.8681,3.4175,1.7579,3.251,0.3173,4.6063,5.1339,1.547,0.9381,3.4757,0.0055,2.4778,2.6585,1.1824,1.1469,2.0863,3.0766,0.0716,2.9142,1.344,4.5349,4.6576,3.7625,3.0847,0.5739,1.4974,1.0041,5.5997,0.8069,0.2876,0.7512,0.5173,2.898,4.3354,2.5156,1.3088,0.2443,5.9555,1.6774,3.9844,6.3901,4.4399,1.338,2.001,1.5492,3.2358,3.0979,0.0039,5.5172,3.7792,0.734,0.7214,5.0819,0.7018,1.3242,2.5694,2.5274,3.0058,4.3993,0.9645,0.0179,1.9392,1.6705,4.7466,4.5486,1.4425,2.3503,6.4224,4.674,1.8551,3.1673,0.2475,0.7754,1.8773,0.1183,4.7765,4.6659,4.4647,1.9126,0.7838,5.6738,0.0365,1.642,5.5908,5.2873,2.826,2.0132,0.0581,2.4334,0.0108,0.0176,0.0002,1.3351,6.3574,2.2791,0.2827,0.0152,5.4091,1.4117,3.0767,4.2607,1.5141,0.1611,5.101,4.6869,1.1868,2.4757,4.4408,0.6329,0.5042,6.6156,0.4013,3.679,4.9926,2.4141,0.0002,1.2058,1.3118,5.2629,0.0252,5.0928,3.8478,5.5628,5.2426,1.9748,2.9015,2.3949,0.0087,0.3289,2.5222,4.4678,1.3066,0.7269,0.8472,6.5307,2.7402,1.7511,4.9688,3.8077,4.8372,2.4486,4.1378,3.8239,3.652,2.4603,3.6724,4.2449,1.0077,0.054,0.4456,4.7799,0.3815,1.1523,1.2574,3.6952,4.7588,0.1429,0.6752,0.0005,0.2874,3.2312,5.5888,0.8296,2.5086,2.0894,3.3335,1.2167,1.6352,1.1654,2.8401,3.709,0.2876,1.2363,6.0129,1.6913,0.0195,2.447,4.7466,0.7605,1.1952,4.2838,1.16,1.3083,2.5173,0.0374,1.1676,4.621,3.1607,4.4629,1.2731,5.8024,3.0436,2.5753,3.5791,4.6962,1.0154,2.3893,0.8403,2.5238,4.4913,2.9696,6.4713,1.5611,0.9471,0.9074,0.3365,0.9553,5.3461,1.6311,3.1961,1.3256,2.7887,0.5905,3.3443,6.1045,4.7647,4.4275,4.7809,0.9308,1.6729,5.6949,1.5196,0.2042,0.0368,0.0474,0.7461,0.8466,4.9906,1.7841,1.3925,1.5801,6.1749,7.0905,0.3981,0.0874,2.9622,1.9545,4.3758,2.7996,0.8194,1.7365,4.4275,4.8332,1.8455,3.9777,4.6585,2.7179,1.701,6.8372,4.0425,4.6929,0.4639,6.3335,1.7114,0.3405,3.3684,0.8149,0.4597,5.4818,0.873,0.2134,1.1505,2.0243,2.2404,2.8068,3.7512,0.4525,3.8501,0.5669,2.6586,4.498,2.2159,1.7219,2.518,1.6151,4.9542,2.056,1.6029]}

{"id":3115,"ended":true,"length":381,"gen_text":"`` A Fool in Love `` was released in July 1960 and became an immediate hit, peaking at number 2 on the Hot R & B Sides chart and number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single went on to reach number 3 on the Hot 50 and number 6 on the Hot 100 R&B Songs charts, although it has never actually topped the R&B Singles chart. The following year, `` A Fool in Love `` was followed by `` One More Chance and Back on the Floor.\nIt is a fairly obvious foreshadowing of what was to come for `` Baby What You Want Me to Do ``, which was released in January 1961 and immediately became a smash hit, peaking at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 R&B Hot 100. A few months later, `` Baby What You Want Me to Do `` became more modestly successful in the Pop and R&B charts with the addition of `` One More Chance and Back on the Floor`` and the release of `` Back on the Floor: Love Gone Bad ` s Only Hope.\nThe success of `` Baby What You Want Me to Do `` may be seen as a turning point in the history of R&B as it became the first album to reach number 1 in both the Pop (number 12) and R&B (number 5), the first to sell over 5 million copies (5,057,000 copies) and the first to sell more than 15 million copies in the UK alone. This is also considered the very beginning of the so called \"Black genre.\"\nAfter that the single would become more important in R&B, but it would still need a hit song to move into upper reaches of the Hot 100 R&B chart and also the R&B Singles chart.\nThis track would also be included on his next Top 10 R&B album, `` Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe! (The Beatles),'' released in June 1962.","token_len":396,"entropy":[7.5493,12.2327,3.0895,0.825,8.0719,6.9484,3.2409,1.0771,4.1572,5.807,2.2515,2.819,2.3775,1.406,1.0129,1.6745,2.2178,0.0019,0.0362,0.9328,3.8549,0.7086,0.0712,6.0313,4.5437,8.0781,0.0082,9.979,1.5374,0.2712,1.8658,1.6948,5.863,0.1108,0.0826,1.3876,0.52,0.0434,0.3964,1.5631,2.2946,3.022,0.6678,0.0081,3.1439,1.0927,2.6418,0.136,0.1246,0.9658,6.3605,1.2116,0.6643,3.0306,0.0233,0.0573,0.436,0.1649,5.1319,0.0696,0.003,2.4606,1.9432,2.024,5.7808,0.6872,3.7521,2.0506,5.9588,2.322,0.2966,2.5758,0.0268,0.0004,2.7351,0.0004,0.1668,0.2036,1.7,4.2417,0.5027,0.1996,3.2154,2.5631,0.0132,0.0151,0.0017,0.196,0.8208,4.4501,0.2435,0.8963,4.7331,1.9544,1.2347,5.4414,6.2438,2.563,0.6931,3.0079,2.3789,2.9192,5.5699,2.0871,3.7441,5.317,3.8283,5.5656,0.3161,0.007,0.5191,1.747,0.8583,0.0728,0.1795,2.2178,2.0576,5.5468,5.4824,0.0279,0.0382,0.1857,0.6566,0.1093,0.4593,2.2432,1.497,1.1356,0.3884,0.501,2.4957,0.6367,1.1538,4.0441,1.4024,0.6401,3.388,0.5401,1.5621,0.2451,0.0002,0.0208,0.0415,1.2868,0.09,0.0785,1.1748,0.0792,0.1472,2.4282,0.0123,0.0017,5.3462,0.1039,2.2717,4.2395,2.7376,0.4583,0.1909,0.1329,1.1846,0.2863,0.014,0.0036,0.0013,0.0019,0.0293,0.0026,0.043,2.4341,7.1845,6.6693,0.751,0.0981,3.3356,0.422,5.57,2.1569,0.8469,0.0082,0.0008,0.286,3.9726,1.6113,2.125,0.0076,2.2314,2.8675,0.3075,0.0327,0.3902,0.1178,0.0302,0.0022,0.0028,3.2272,2.139,2.1017,3.0242,0.0093,0.7136,3.4168,0.6408,0.0381,0.0413,1.5961,5.6906,6.0995,0.3707,4.1947,3.2543,5.511,2.2107,1.2126,1.205,1.7432,2.6533,0.0579,0.0894,0.0875,0.0046,0.0034,0.0013,0.001,0.0119,0.0018,0.0304,5.5082,1.5757,3.0422,0.5371,0.7887,5.5126,0.0091,0.5118,0.4302,2.2543,0.0051,1.8912,0.0624,0.0007,2.9727,2.0078,2.5324,1.2976,1.4431,3.382,0.4979,2.5114,0.7414,0.7415,1.5607,0.9108,0.1588,0.9843,5.7415,1.5236,5.2198,0.4435,0.0102,0.179,0.0036,0.0004,0.1573,0.0469,3.0801,5.6803,3.3522,0.3246,1.1302,2.2727,1.1034,4.124,0.0852,0.1727,3.0322,2.3744,0.8503,5.5376,0.0018,0.8256,1.4969,1.5989,0.2438,0.2525,0.0895,0.2931,1.2707,1.9504,0.0818,4.425,0.0724,0.1512,1.8453,0.368,6.3338,0.666,0.5294,3.8309,3.4069,2.0048,4.7062,2.0745,5.5289,1.0706,0.0109,0.3846,5.0466,2.6517,1.2522,4.9293,3.6823,3.2124,0.721,3.988,4.7046,3.6356,5.1326,3.2031,2.3176,1.9195,5.4116,1.9449,1.7118,0.0203,0.0009,1.4949,2.1032,1.6237,0.9463,1.5336,4.6769,1.6373,1.6694,2.4315,0.4664,4.3323,3.1487,7.1826,1.9655,0.3564,0.0606,1.7468,0.315,1.7502,0.0034,0.0009,1.6211,2.4488,4.4903,2.33,2.4348,0.0141,0.0023,1.483,0.0001,0.2191,0.3314,2.0762,3.2581,5.4218,1.9264,3.4616,1.4423,4.7993,0.607,4.734,2.2689,6.1652,1.1931,0.9446,0.0095,0.0007,1.9028,0.462,0.337,5.8193,3.4521,2.8628,0.001,0.0085,0.0261,0.0014,0.0122,4.7126,3.5011,3.027,5.2325,3.7366,2.7326,1.5431,0.2027,2.8805,1.3042,0.3995]}

As early as T @ - @ < unk > league I'm which it's not so difficult to see in the way @ - @ ditching the ball to get his own shot. In short, he did everything he knew to do to keep the ball in the yard - a hard time since he's never thrown a pitch over 100 mph. \u2014 Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) July 13, 2017\n\nAt age 39, Hanigan is certainly not pitching for his next contract, but he's also not being paid like one. In Hanigan's case, every game represents a chance for him to get a win, since he is scheduled with a 4.56 ERA through his first 14 starts. And he's also a proven pitcher who can be counted on to deliver a quality start nearly every time out. In other words, Hanigan's deal is one that is reasonably sustainable.\n\nI can't argue that a contract with the Cubs shouldn't have been made. But the fact that it wasn't makes it less valuable for the organization, as it continues to give out so many contracts.\n\nNow, if the team does decide to move Hanigan at some point in the next two years, one could certainly argue that this was the best possible way to go. He may not be pitching as well as he used to, but the Cubs don't have many players that would realistically get hurt the same way over the course of an entire season that Hanigan would. Even if you want to argue that the team should have done better, and he needed less money to get a deal, it's unlikely that a contract the team is handing out on a regular basis makes up for Hanigan playing worse at the plate.\n\nOf course, Hanigan himself is probably as upset that the deal didn't go through as much as you'd expect.","token_len":396,"entropy":[8.9841,2.3187,7.4638,6.9313,0.5876,10.1815,4.3507,1.2682,5.7221,0.6602,0.6795,9.4422,6.7297,10.0094,14.0302,10.3045,8.0317,7.1208,1.2215,4.6975,7.7157,0.0412,8.9534,10.2455,3.3648,0.6105,7.8469,9.3274,2.5728,3.2262,8.3979,4.694,3.6599,10.1777,5.603,1.1641,3.2752,4.7466,5.4872,0.3368,1.5814,5.3751,1.6321,3.3458,3.5629,0.6201,0.1162,5.9526,5.2322,1.9856,2.9062,3.0096,2.5404,3.4108,4.4328,4.07,1.0047,3.944,4.9915,0.5554,1.539,6.6741,2.9122,1.3235,6.079,1.9551,0.1408,1.2821,4.7342,1.97,1.8273,0.8216,1.3655,1.6872,4.6534,4.0678,4.8558,5.4529,5.1718,1.2221,1.6471,3.303,4.5116,0.8498,2.0821,3.4996,1.7097,0.4043,0.6414,3.8794,3.9049,0.1559,0.0,0.003,0.0016,0.0078,0.0002,0.0008,1.8947,3.7031,0.0008,1.5597,0.0869,0.0012,5.7014,3.7815,3.1472,0.2329,0.3053,0.0131,1.2379,5.11,1.4989,4.8936,2.1746,1.5685,1.7429,0.5212,1.3113,0.5334,1.0575,1.0871,2.7452,0.4851,4.7538,0.5071,0.7802,1.396,0.5455,3.3621,4.5864,0.0134,0.0689,1.3449,0.0524,6.3096,3.9484,4.6875,0.6438,1.8299,1.6569,1.2764,0.0157,2.6689,2.1058,3.0976,1.3729,5.7387,0.9897,3.1896,4.9018,8.2831,1.6412,4.7369,0.4208,4.9637,0.0533,3.1157,1.2445,0.1528,3.6948,0.5642,0.6822,3.5981,2.1614,0.6645,3.5344,3.2906,4.6723,3.1046,1.4047,3.0105,2.1463,1.0669,0.0663,0.4913,3.6227,2.0279,0.8241,0.1777,5.7518,0.0446,0.4512,0.6714,0.1875,3.61,2.3181,0.01,0.0264,1.2953,0.0035,2.183,5.4905,0.7471,3.2904,0.8646,2.4051,5.4707,5.0391,1.6657,0.5846,0.0002,5.1863,3.7733,0.5396,4.4838,1.9306,4.2586,3.5327,2.287,2.4865,3.4466,3.9478,0.0004,2.5927,0.9374,2.3824,1.152,2.2728,2.1066,2.3544,0.5513,0.9553,1.3883,0.0002,2.1375,1.3701,3.7918,3.5341,2.5713,0.5711,2.3984,1.5712,2.8827,1.4056,5.2262,0.0879,5.3682,4.1048,5.6568,0.6297,2.3551,1.8412,1.8931,0.0002,4.7621,0.769,2.5347,1.087,3.1916,3.5234,1.2795,0.1191,1.8711,0.3503,0.0029,3.4056,0.4148,0.009,1.5847,0.1292,2.0935,2.4733,1.281,0.1606,5.4789,2.5076,3.1866,0.8508,0.1352,3.7639,1.8774,1.316,1.5903,2.4039,2.9799,0.3153,1.3639,1.3007,3.4574,4.6355,0.5931,0.7749,3.7752,2.7854,0.2436,0.4304,0.2903,2.6948,0.0027,0.1536,0.0894,2.4721,1.4302,3.7076,0.0002,0.7991,2.2486,4.4695,2.5909,3.2423,5.6386,3.9869,4.653,5.2486,3.1242,0.0276,5.9433,0.3485,0.6894,0.0025,2.856,0.2657,0.0982,5.2168,0.3011,0.001,1.5752,0.1867,5.0575,0.5359,3.8898,3.7725,0.0395,0.798,0.1103,1.991,1.4726,1.3954,0.5191,3.197,2.645,1.5378,4.6509,4.4985,5.8532,5.8917,0.4886,1.5088,2.0126,2.2625,2.3083,1.4358,1.8864,0.5829,4.831,0.298,2.9096,4.7694,5.2541,1.4566,2.8996,4.9075,0.0426,4.095,0.4226,1.8649,0.0041,3.7958,4.2107,0.056,4.8256,0.0046,8.0046,3.8502,4.342,0.7653,0.3682,0.3779,0.3539,0.0002,3.7779,0.0191,0.0185,2.5334,0.006,4.4768,2.0711,2.4501,5.5095,3.0306,3.9729,1.3786,1.3273,1.668,0.0002,2.3635,0.0716,0.1953,3.551,0.0488,2.362,2.2452,0.5069,0.5083]}

The harassment includes death threats directed at her family and husband and harassment of her employer and other people who were involved in the creation of the videos.

Now I'm gonna get the hell out of the business and I get no further from my ass. I hope to one day run it down and start your own business. I would like your blessing in this endeavor.

{"id":1783,"ended":true,"length":351,"gen_text":"The battles between the Song and the Jin spurred the invention and use of gunpowder weapons. There are reports that the fire lance, one of the earliest ancestors of the firearm, was developed in China in the fifth century BC to kill people on the battlefield.\n\nThe Song dynasty\n\nIn the second half of the seventh century B.C., the Jin Dynasty, founded by Ma Yuan, began using gunpowder weapons.\n\nIn 48 BC, the Jin defeated and captured the city of Chang'an in the west.\n\nWhen war broke out again in 578 BC, the Jin made new weapons, such as gunbai (iron bolts), with which they fought the Song. While the Jin were defeating the Song, the Song were fighting with bamboo. A few of the Song may have died because of bamboo darts, but the Jin won with the fire lance and other weapons.\n\nThe Jin also learned to smelt iron during the reigns of the Ming Emperor Wu Zhangshi and Emperor Wu Shizhe.\n\nThe Song\n\nThe Song made some of the first successful composite bows in southern China, based on bamboo. Later in the ninth century, the Song used gunpowder guns, like the one used today against terrorists.\n\nThe Song made composite bows using bronze, iron, and bamboo. When war broke out again in the late seventh century, they replaced bows with heavier ones. This forced enemies to use composite bows, making warfare more destructive.\n\nFirearms were the Song's answer to the Jin. They could be employed as a deadly force against the Song and against invaders, and they could be used to defend Song-ruled cities.\n\nThe Song also wrote histories and created the first writing system, but they still did not develop the writing of poetry, which the Jin did.\n\nThe Song Dynasty\n\nThe Song gave up their weapons when the Mongols took over in the 13th century.","token_len":397,"entropy":[10.7441,2.7271,1.1347,10.3797,1.5658,0.887,6.3931,8.9377,1.026,5.6582,3.328,2.2151,0.0062,4.0368,0.0044,2.9073,1.2528,5.6137,1.4033,4.9959,0.9462,1.2087,6.5689,7.7702,0.4436,1.9699,4.4595,0.056,0.085,1.1378,9.6157,0.0488,0.4992,4.0871,0.1309,0.3083,2.5484,1.3804,0.903,2.5099,0.4343,4.0328,0.0645,1.8736,4.8409,2.8203,3.3242,3.3279,1.1317,0.0648,0.3688,1.3829,0.0067,1.6409,1.6284,1.829,4.0497,0.0002,2.3427,0.6874,3.7703,0.6973,0.0027,0.0086,2.256,0.0099,4.3651,0.0055,0.0065,0.2582,0.3745,2.9834,1.97,1.7165,3.7582,0.3097,5.5724,3.296,0.3272,2.8958,5.5638,1.9341,0.0026,0.4138,1.3833,3.1245,0.0002,2.3299,6.1656,3.896,0.11,0.8324,1.0246,1.5646,4.1447,2.7002,0.3923,3.6983,0.0427,2.5259,0.108,0.0018,1.402,1.9621,5.1015,1.2892,3.0592,0.0002,4.6276,6.3583,0.7878,0.0027,1.0971,0.7824,2.739,4.3853,1.5656,0.1703,0.4067,0.7344,4.9109,6.0744,3.0761,1.9809,1.991,0.0044,3.2241,5.6484,0.908,1.4162,5.1414,4.8963,1.3397,4.9324,0.9118,0.3646,3.7139,0.7013,0.6876,0.7238,6.716,0.4973,1.8476,1.6281,4.3331,0.0996,0.045,0.3729,0.8112,1.5599,1.0262,5.0422,3.4885,4.4677,3.3066,5.2174,4.2199,2.8847,0.3645,1.2621,5.8102,0.0486,3.4928,3.1668,0.3753,0.6591,5.1983,1.4247,1.2623,0.8357,1.5785,2.6506,4.124,1.9795,4.0789,0.1188,0.0187,2.5203,2.6858,1.1288,0.3941,0.2313,0.0002,0.9773,1.5497,2.5946,4.5188,1.6922,5.3107,0.0792,0.4806,6.3475,1.1261,2.2558,4.1918,0.0012,1.7727,4.5173,3.9213,2.6911,6.4324,4.1018,0.9315,2.3018,2.2428,5.4294,1.8662,6.1093,0.6619,0.7057,0.0002,0.8985,0.9745,2.4752,0.0002,1.1021,0.1233,5.9469,3.8136,2.7877,0.3105,1.0858,4.6095,6.0982,0.5842,2.3036,5.155,0.0359,1.6756,5.2487,0.0546,3.242,1.1864,4.6315,2.9349,0.1919,3.6612,0.0345,0.3792,0.8809,0.3408,2.4193,1.7223,0.0127,3.7769,2.0311,4.9367,0.7044,1.9534,2.4154,3.7571,4.2733,2.484,0.9243,0.3309,0.0002,0.9613,0.3554,4.1211,2.5932,0.2427,2.7654,6.1559,1.4151,1.6145,0.429,0.5293,1.9436,0.5942,5.1162,4.2668,0.2528,0.0012,0.3289,0.159,1.1887,2.8666,2.6172,0.0627,0.2059,2.2347,4.7959,3.0413,0.1046,6.4776,4.1167,1.0607,3.5765,4.8034,6.0455,0.1702,1.699,3.9858,0.1587,1.1918,3.5863,4.6624,0.8319,4.3808,0.3559,0.2179,0.0002,5.0653,0.6204,2.1656,3.9382,2.4449,0.1658,3.2564,0.0469,0.8621,1.4467,1.8792,2.1944,3.0491,1.0976,6.2237,2.8706,1.2181,4.351,3.1568,0.9222,1.564,1.9299,1.9485,3.0359,3.7065,2.1669,2.0649,1.4526,0.8008,0.781,0.2959,0.9829,2.06,3.8332,3.2959,2.5892,0.0018,1.8289,0.7447,0.4189,0.0002,1.0202,0.5347,2.1409,6.0629,5.3787,1.9418,3.3492,3.7627,0.8564,4.523,0.4669,1.5423,4.4036,1.1711,4.6958,3.2582,0.067,2.5807,1.9596,3.7195,1.8678,2.0071,1.8832,1.6491,3.4189,0.4993,1.7875,1.0161,0.487,0.0002,0.8602,0.8026,1.2988,0.4713,0.0002,0.8178,0.1167,6.7112,2.2804,1.5113,3.4364,2.9794,1.3664,3.5625,0.0022,5.3747,0.9625,2.548,0.7174,2.4349,0.0114,0.0273,0.3599]}

Their 1992 album Scrolls of the < unk > garnered the band some attention from the heavy metal underground and landed them in the prestigious year-end Australian metal poll. The band continued to play in the United States for several years, although never quite reaching the levels of success in their home country as they did in Australia. In 2004, the band signed to Nuclear Blast Records and produced a number of well-received metal albums for the label.\n\n\nIn 2005, Mortification released their 5-CD set Blood and Stone: New Perspectives, which was accompanied with two CD-Rs of demos and live material. While the band continued playing for years, Mortification eventually disbanded with guitarist Greg Aversa in 2012. In March 2014, Aversa revealed that he was forced out of the group in 2014.\n\n\nMortification's first studio releases included 2004's Mortal Flesh, 2005's Rituals of Flesh, and 2006's Unholy Fire. After the album release, Mortification toured with some of the other heavy metal\/thrash bands of the time. Later in 2008, Averman released the third installment of the band's Spell of the Dead 2-CD package. From there, Mortification put out a series of EPs and singles: The Rituals (2009), Rituals of Flesh: The Complete Collection (2010), and Rituals of Flesh (2011). With the release of their 6-LP The Final Manifesting in December 2013, Mortification finally established as a full-fledged touring act.

{"id":922,"ended":true,"length":364,"gen_text":"Mogadishu has a number of hotels, most of which were recently constructed. The city's many returning expatriates, investors and international community workers are among these establishments'main customers. To provide food and drink in Mogadishu's hotels and restaurants (many of which are popular because of the city's proximity to the country's capital), restaurants and hotels in the city are allowed to sell alcohol into other cities in Somalia.\nWith this situation, Mogadishu is not without problem of drinking.\nIn September, a spate of fatal incidents where young people died from alcoholic drinks led to intense media scrutiny on Somalia's hospitality sector. This led the Somali National Civil Service to issue a call to all Somali expatriates for advice on safe practices.\nWith this, the University of Southern California's School of Nursing (USN), a large expatriate institution in the city with over 30,000 overseas students, issued a formal alert to its nursing students. The USN is also working with the UN, WHO and other NGO's to combat the increasing number of deaths from alcohol abuse during the holidays.\nAlcohol consumption in Mogadishu is largely regulated by Somali law, although the government has issued a set of guidelines that encourage drinking during the holidays.\nIn 2005, the Somali National Police started the \" Special Drunken Driving Campaign \" aimed at discouraging alcohol abuse among the Somali people. In practice, the campaign includes several tactics such as deploying police officers in the downtown business district, patrolling in the area where the Somali community congregates, and issuing warnings. The Somali National Police also encourages Somali community members to call the number 774 for a 24-hour emergency 24-hour hotline to report any drinking incidents, including driving under the influence.\nIn order to avoid a repeat of this problem, the University of Southern California's School of Nursing is encouraging Somali students to visit their home countries and ask if they do, in fact, allow citizens to drink alcohol.","token_len":397,"entropy":[7.5781,2.3532,0.0013,4.0659,2.8496,5.0372,0.0038,3.9481,1.1524,3.5793,0.4189,0.4368,3.4502,4.5514,4.5283,1.4036,1.7505,3.0104,2.0053,5.4952,13.8052,1.3277,0.4275,0.1162,2.3379,8.7615,0.7408,4.0414,6.6802,4.5098,1.7798,4.42,5.1634,7.4988,15.8129,6.3076,8.3994,0.3973,5.9289,3.9786,4.9514,0.8425,2.2368,3.032,3.0879,0.0003,0.0001,2.1048,1.8121,1.5118,1.1416,6.2911,3.9231,0.2335,0.1418,0.6347,4.5631,5.7925,0.2176,0.8514,2.3658,0.0128,2.1614,0.0393,0.6611,4.5734,0.0566,2.1438,0.6162,3.3984,1.4308,0.9393,2.57,0.8315,0.3036,1.8213,4.1232,0.0895,1.7863,0.8664,7.011,6.5184,2.6949,2.3316,0.9012,0.6843,1.6868,11.7785,3.1103,5.2684,0.6781,2.5818,0.0007,0.0009,2.5386,2.5103,4.4035,5.0773,4.621,3.6865,1.1133,3.062,2.758,4.6421,2.233,1.8789,5.7363,0.0028,5.061,2.116,6.0833,3.2219,1.9266,2.2431,1.9249,4.9264,3.1419,2.2752,0.4484,6.4,2.3827,3.0019,1.4719,2.7125,0.2818,4.8834,2.0777,0.3604,3.5107,2.525,2.5435,1.6265,3.1666,4.7102,1.8256,1.483,2.0471,0.5319,5.0422,1.4361,1.7454,1.8515,4.1604,0.1477,0.1996,3.8409,3.3833,0.5744,3.3287,3.2035,1.3449,0.8482,4.65,1.8733,2.2713,1.2154,5.8874,0.0891,5.0223,0.6801,1.4404,3.6226,0.0141,3.2365,2.667,0.3327,2.4585,1.8787,2.9505,4.2578,3.2182,0.5142,0.0133,2.0284,1.361,1.1049,1.2856,5.5815,2.0955,3.2514,0.0869,0.0105,6.439,0.3318,0.326,2.4106,0.4278,5.1229,5.084,1.3443,0.7501,1.9969,0.2899,2.5283,1.261,2.185,0.0018,3.2546,2.7385,2.8278,0.3118,0.8434,4.1508,3.2767,2.6329,0.6298,1.0789,4.8725,0.3266,0.3966,4.1532,0.6509,4.2932,1.7534,0.0087,1.4135,1.2911,1.0303,2.4663,6.5861,0.8368,3.5544,0.3983,0.2893,4.1129,0.0128,3.1476,1.4785,1.8878,0.0006,0.0002,0.9198,4.7856,3.7547,0.6258,3.4156,1.4332,1.428,3.0094,1.6136,2.152,1.0213,4.3404,1.5521,4.5841,0.0792,0.8574,2.3447,4.4782,4.1776,2.5893,0.8537,1.6622,0.3518,1.3265,2.5934,5.6113,0.1019,0.6926,1.1021,1.5618,3.1475,3.4762,3.8447,1.6305,7.9445,5.558,0.6039,1.0048,2.3366,0.7436,3.4634,0.0695,1.5856,3.5045,1.9342,1.6609,2.0522,0.9827,2.8011,0.2734,2.8481,5.9426,0.1185,1.4869,0.4226,4.3664,3.906,4.0702,2.4844,0.0047,5.8758,1.4654,0.7448,2.116,2.4341,4.9774,4.6673,0.7053,1.8122,4.6453,2.9408,1.763,3.3856,2.6581,2.3785,2.7175,2.1761,1.4795,0.0218,0.6817,0.6526,3.3344,1.3072,3.1445,2.3269,2.4841,0.7711,0.0601,1.3269,4.0368,1.6337,3.317,0.345,0.14,3.3436,0.998,5.3573,4.5455,4.0854,2.4619,2.0941,1.9814,0.3971,0.0243,3.1698,6.1212,0.2843,0.0966,1.1693,2.5062,0.4549,2.1119,4.0629,2.47,3.149,2.3765,3.5827,0.2612,0.0096,0.001,0.7375,0.3013,2.1437,4.0454,0.09,3.5424,3.8723,2.321,0.042,2.9712,2.7946,0.3869,0.5057,2.3769,0.0605,0.0571,0.0037,1.0545,0.5002,0.0029,0.0089,1.6931,2.591,1.3964,0.8908,0.3895,4.3105,2.0863,3.5376,0.8305,1.7238,4.0879,3.8724,1.1137,6.0031,3.2959,0.3614,0.0057,0.0128,2.0326,6.3994,0.4486,0.3742,0.9795,1.4539]}
{"id":3823,"ended":true,"length":358,"gen_text":"In 2013, former ABC Network President Steven McPherson and Rich Frank, the former chairman of Disney Channel became investors and board members as the company worked to develop new content and improve advertising sales. At the end of the year, CKE Restaurants Inc. acquired a majority stake in the company. In 2014, the company added KFC Yum! Brands Inc., Pizza Hut and Taco Bell as its new strategic partners. During June 2015, CKE Restaurants Inc., Pizza Hut and Taco Bell launched their own restaurants, and each announced plans to add additional franchises. McDonald's Corp., Starbucks Corp. and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. will also open restaurants in Singapore and the Philippines. While KFC Yum! Brands Inc., Pizza Hut & Taco Bell have the largest number of franchisees, the number of McDonald's and Starbucks sales employees has grown while they have closed five restaurants in the U.S., including three in recent years. In the first half of 2015, CKE Restaurants Inc, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell created about 700 new jobs in the U.S during the second quarter.\n\nIn April, the company announced it would build and open a new pizza restaurant in Irvine, California, with plans to create about 500 new jobs when it opens. In May, the company acquired the Burger King Company. When closing this deal, the two companies will operate the parent company under the name McDonald's Corporation. McDonald's has been the McDonald's corporation since 1961.\n\nIn June, the company raised its average daily same-store sales at U.S. restaurants by 2.5%, compared with the same period a year ago, reflecting food industry improvement and the effect of McDonald's initiatives, including offering smaller portions at prices 10% lower than industry average. In June, the company also announced U.S. sales at established locations in Japan increased 1.2% during the same period, compared with the same quarter a year earlier.","token_len":397,"entropy":[5.6128,0.2112,6.057,7.3315,7.2892,2.6357,8.0439,3.2817,2.3553,0.0154,0.0019,3.2992,8.8125,8.405,0.4351,1.8931,1.3991,2.4323,0.2723,4.3705,4.0137,10.3141,5.7006,3.8487,3.3754,0.0696,5.4978,2.6509,1.3205,4.9637,0.3093,3.5791,2.6334,2.5344,2.0527,4.7056,6.9874,1.0051,0.335,4.6095,0.2305,2.77,0.0058,1.3012,0.5463,0.1034,6.1726,5.0966,1.175,0.0001,2.4955,0.4683,2.695,1.9687,1.6957,0.3545,0.225,0.6821,0.5379,0.7521,2.5499,1.13,0.0666,1.4388,0.2504,3.2986,5.3944,0.1266,3.9696,0.0648,0.12,0.0465,0.3842,0.9842,0.9896,0.0015,1.1277,0.318,0.0011,1.486,2.2509,3.5975,5.0455,0.1883,0.3001,5.513,7.6588,1.3425,0.0476,1.8337,0.012,0.4746,0.0,0.6818,4.0719,2.7161,0.0094,0.2352,0.0242,0.0002,3.1221,1.8471,1.7445,3.1549,2.7768,3.0164,5.5122,4.4166,0.6554,0.0898,2.8365,2.7941,4.5802,1.1796,4.7498,0.0205,0.8958,2.2718,5.222,0.0964,0.5286,0.0888,5.2044,0.0029,0.0011,0.0006,0.2321,0.0722,1.2924,0.0776,5.1096,1.2806,1.738,2.2832,0.4602,6.5216,2.0264,2.3247,0.6917,1.2413,6.861,5.2089,0.0022,1.0362,0.0021,0.0581,0.1675,0.1348,1.3653,0.1699,0.001,6.7789,0.0155,0.0003,2.1118,4.2374,1.4197,1.4606,0.004,3.18,0.9613,0.7513,1.7427,2.8511,0.061,2.3828,0.0184,1.8206,0.2179,5.8124,4.846,2.4187,1.8409,5.783,4.4435,0.5336,3.4666,5.5122,1.9004,1.2503,0.8945,1.5157,0.001,0.0097,2.494,2.7764,3.1559,0.2751,4.9518,1.4835,0.1748,2.2133,2.3907,2.1478,1.4352,0.02,1.3386,0.022,1.9763,0.0042,0.1092,0.0008,0.0549,3.131,0.1508,0.0043,0.8967,0.0047,0.0003,5.6255,4.4151,4.1208,0.5003,0.2721,1.0363,0.2826,0.1037,0.0009,0.0007,10.2366,0.6766,3.6318,0.1358,0.5804,1.1875,0.001,2.5356,3.484,2.2022,1.6321,0.2142,1.069,1.8851,1.1275,4.3615,4.0639,0.4888,1.331,0.7815,6.0405,0.3238,0.2276,5.244,0.1575,0.5467,0.9168,3.2833,1.5276,0.1814,4.0659,2.0872,2.3983,1.0661,0.1813,5.5358,0.3493,0.1025,2.1465,1.8536,1.6923,0.127,1.0054,0.0756,4.7793,1.953,4.751,0.0798,5.484,2.404,6.29,6.8866,3.8118,0.5007,0.1463,1.2674,4.6086,0.3923,2.0744,3.4356,2.4735,6.3159,0.1971,3.9108,0.916,1.6297,2.6597,0.013,1.5518,0.6182,3.3144,0.0045,3.0155,2.4451,2.3091,5.6337,0.0135,4.03,0.4182,4.1059,0.5998,0.9406,0.0002,1.8288,2.1319,0.5066,0.9126,0.1043,5.9277,0.4276,3.9939,1.805,3.3975,0.0327,0.1274,0.0221,4.2325,1.0615,0.0009,0.0015,0.0086,0.2368,0.9565,1.551,0.3882,1.8986,1.8587,3.902,0.6222,0.4463,0.3363,0.2976,1.6383,0.0005,1.0133,1.4668,4.9592,6.2306,4.7126,3.4252,1.2886,2.2904,5.0664,0.0094,4.8982,0.0016,4.0418,1.8266,0.6244,4.7755,5.5053,3.0383,3.0322,3.2271,4.0497,0.2709,0.7448,0.3062,6.3914,0.9795,0.5808,2.0276,2.6926,0.157,0.6472,0.1197,1.6478,1.0414,5.8073,0.0014,0.0306,0.0187,1.5774,1.1067,3.8877,2.9836,2.4367,2.6296,2.1806,1.8786,0.4782,2.2842,0.457,2.1687,0.1524,3.4495,0.3028,1.4399,2.293,0.0841,0.2495,0.2151,3.2535,0.4544,0.0003,1.46,0.2887]}
{"id":463,"ended":true,"length":371,"gen_text":"The `` Intelligence Management System `` featured in Voyage is a score assigned to the player by the Selenites, the natives of the moon. For each puzzle the player solves, and for each piece of the game, the Selenites rank the puzzle and give the player a ranking in the scoring system. Players are also given numerical figures to represent their rankings to the Selenites. With the Selenites on the moon, the player has four choices of how to progress and solves the puzzles during the game. The Selenites will also have information about where the player can go, but no specific answers for the puzzles are being given. This allows the player to set up his own puzzles, and determine what clues or clues for each puzzle are to be given with which player the player will be matched up.\nI found this game fascinating to the point where I decided to try to learn about the Selenites themselves, and my first guess was that the Selenites were a new species created by the Selenites to aid in the colonization and colonization of the moon. The Selenites are a new species with a new culture, based on a completely different philosophy and philosophy on life. As for why they are there, I found the whole thing to be a mystery to me. I found the whole planet to be one big piece of research by the Selenites on how to explore beyond the moon, and the game offers a lot of information on the Selenites and the planet, and I think there could be a few more details on the Selenites, as they had never done an episode before. What I did like about Voyage is that it is a unique type puzzle game that you get to explore and solve, the puzzles are unique and you have a fair amount of decision making but with an easy learning curve. The amount of content is also quite good, I am glad that there is such a high amount of puzzle content in this game.","token_len":398,"entropy":[11.0309,14.5606,6.3036,3.7897,1.3907,12.1782,1.1481,14.9485,0.7501,5.2248,1.3443,11.0288,9.2167,0.2085,2.1077,6.2138,1.9627,0.5091,12.4533,2.4318,4.9925,1.6704,1.9073,7.0955,0.1478,0.9104,3.6081,0.588,5.1386,1.3792,6.8324,1.811,0.2092,0.6181,0.2527,5.8984,1.3827,0.1897,3.7044,0.0937,3.2493,2.1998,1.847,0.4539,1.3697,0.0062,0.1482,5.5591,0.3371,1.6844,1.9613,1.4242,0.9754,0.1309,0.4207,3.8471,3.1472,0.5777,4.7384,0.3746,0.1623,4.6133,2.3152,2.9114,1.083,5.4424,6.7962,1.7358,1.617,0.5479,4.6553,5.4871,0.6859,0.117,0.0022,0.0122,0.405,5.5197,1.131,2.8079,0.0083,0.0554,4.3588,0.9298,0.3641,0.3777,1.0727,0.73,2.1758,6.3933,2.9004,2.1864,1.2584,0.2033,5.0105,4.2364,5.7112,0.9879,0.3303,7.0384,0.7669,0.2928,0.3324,1.1782,2.2321,0.0038,0.0377,2.1698,2.678,4.6037,3.6246,1.0217,4.1469,0.6302,0.3041,2.7457,1.7436,2.0778,3.5212,4.8416,3.7788,4.741,2.9986,0.6895,0.1197,2.9277,6.4255,0.4221,0.4678,3.6096,2.7718,0.4271,0.2578,0.0896,5.4552,1.5061,2.0816,0.9414,1.5817,1.7339,1.5194,5.2155,2.1588,4.4272,3.1103,1.9906,6.3041,3.0982,0.0986,1.8677,4.089,0.0677,1.0391,7.1568,2.8382,3.7671,4.0753,1.2617,2.0563,1.3809,4.2257,1.8698,0.699,2.0068,7.3368,3.965,1.4681,1.6553,3.7162,2.9597,3.8936,0.546,1.3783,0.1937,3.0476,0.1574,2.6756,0.8863,3.9183,2.821,0.7111,0.6648,0.0108,0.0552,4.0782,1.7305,0.9365,4.9293,2.1597,4.3506,0.3445,0.445,1.0643,0.1459,0.0035,0.0147,0.6653,1.9294,5.6798,1.2089,2.8533,0.3105,0.4092,1.2747,0.0161,0.1633,1.5433,4.1933,1.0431,1.0485,2.525,3.278,2.3764,0.1283,0.2189,0.3033,0.2847,2.3368,0.6736,0.0046,0.0345,1.8481,2.2601,2.4625,1.1503,3.8726,1.3541,1.6036,2.5166,1.0221,6.0091,0.481,1.8586,4.5348,0.8208,2.6235,1.7252,2.4813,3.5876,0.9333,1.095,4.2275,4.049,2.5164,0.8743,1.4337,3.2508,0.4019,1.2595,3.1879,2.3699,4.6145,1.5248,2.007,0.0368,1.6694,1.9654,1.9569,0.2473,0.5297,1.4406,2.8041,1.4463,3.4163,5.2047,0.6781,0.0509,5.4172,0.7053,5.9043,0.1013,5.7759,5.0468,0.3551,0.1235,0.0029,0.0257,3.3758,1.2285,0.3172,5.1245,5.3602,0.3251,0.4686,1.3397,0.5656,2.7338,4.8659,4.6646,1.5095,1.5084,0.0882,1.5071,1.4101,1.2139,0.8588,0.006,0.0839,1.4208,1.7351,3.4198,1.8754,1.89,2.9293,2.8603,3.7463,2.8509,0.2136,0.897,3.9421,0.9468,2.881,1.7754,0.7199,0.372,0.0044,0.0362,2.5447,2.906,2.6963,5.1992,4.5445,5.7262,2.2075,4.1157,1.693,0.8877,5.0871,0.6617,2.2152,2.2295,0.5845,2.1704,0.0003,1.462,0.4405,0.8338,2.0047,1.1861,4.5991,4.0845,5.5704,0.2541,1.7065,4.2245,4.608,0.2527,2.2425,1.7848,0.9289,2.145,5.1857,1.1286,0.6281,2.9204,1.1741,3.3915,1.9067,1.9315,5.5651,0.4286,0.0256,5.5248,0.23,6.4656,4.1014,3.5678,2.6115,2.9976,0.0024,0.5664,2.0747,6.3656,0.0087,4.6414,1.6818,1.9091,2.3865,1.7016,0.809,2.8959,4.1372,4.5671,1.1832,1.9637,0.6576,4.6262,0.1774,3.8478,0.7425,0.0353,3.3329,0.7412,1.6678,1.2927,0.0862,0.9757]}
{"id":2800,"ended":true,"length":364,"gen_text":"The idea of a link between the South Forty @ - @ Foot Drain and the River Nene is not new, as the first plans for such a connection were proposed in 1809.\nBattles in the Battle of Shiloh on September 6th 1832 between General George Hood and General Benjamin Butler did not stop the battle to follow, and the waterway was not fully used until the following year.\nEven though the original plans were not followed, the River Nene is the most popular tourist route in the state.\nThe waterway is bordered on the northern bank by the foot ramp of New River Road, which was first paved in 1969, and the foot ramp of US 40, one kilometer north of Shiloh.\nThe Waterway was the first state road to be elevated above river level. Currently, New River Road is being paved to the same grade as US 40, with the addition of a concrete deck and new utility structures. Also, the new concrete structure will be built to higher standards than the foot ramp itself, thereby making the entire project safer.\nNew River Road.\nWhile the New River @ foot is closed for major demolition and rehabilitation on the state highway, a $2 million grant funded by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) will allow South Forty @ - @ Foot to be restored, making it the most accessible public right-of way in the state.\nThe grant is part of an effort to open the Shiloh area to traffic, especially pedestrians and bicyclists, by 2020.\nAn updated map of the Shiloh New River @ Foot will be done this summer and will be updated again in 2018. It is very likely that South Forty @ - @ Foot will again become a popular tourist draw, and in the future this part of the New River @ foot will serve a purpose in the national parks system. I am glad that my friend is planning to bring Shiloh to the next level.","token_len":398,"entropy":[6.1716,1.2097,2.0133,7.2923,0.5283,1.9699,7.6433,12.8839,11.5785,8.2515,8.7538,9.481,12.5605,0.7787,0.472,4.6516,5.1937,2.4516,1.3819,1.9289,0.9535,1.9078,2.8325,2.065,4.0297,7.0731,0.5178,3.863,0.1085,2.2486,0.7153,3.1329,0.6544,2.1014,6.1879,0.7381,2.1318,8.6523,5.1669,0.5075,2.96,0.6352,4.2134,0.2164,4.922,0.0839,0.0497,3.5096,2.8577,3.3283,2.6492,1.7309,2.1937,3.0697,3.5114,2.8638,5.9012,0.2828,1.4183,4.2097,1.4516,4.8986,0.607,2.3995,0.6451,4.5702,4.8455,4.6872,1.5884,1.471,1.4068,4.4676,0.9374,0.8948,3.5835,3.4547,3.7533,0.6291,1.3292,3.0323,0.3399,0.4113,1.6188,5.5231,1.9645,0.682,4.75,1.1487,1.6274,1.8133,3.1357,0.8006,0.7077,3.9074,0.1287,0.002,2.7117,3.3536,2.1949,2.364,3.5306,3.0423,1.1451,0.568,2.6018,1.27,1.5306,1.5704,3.5508,0.0362,1.2854,5.683,0.005,1.5833,0.7113,5.7892,3.9986,0.0667,0.7977,4.7586,7.1539,1.2175,7.0519,0.6602,0.6086,0.9361,2.4107,2.4324,4.5886,2.4284,0.1967,5.0172,1.5845,0.3458,2.3741,2.6963,1.2028,0.27,4.8804,3.9907,1.1579,6.187,8.1693,0.0644,1.6959,0.3007,3.0277,0.0023,0.001,0.6094,0.5996,1.1427,3.9401,0.9964,2.4287,3.9126,1.5547,4.0446,1.323,0.8737,0.6526,5.1098,1.9603,3.951,0.2772,1.7256,6.5036,0.5548,4.4467,0.0248,0.0697,0.8708,3.7175,3.0074,1.6978,2.0252,2.6489,2.9759,0.2378,2.2217,0.0416,1.1739,3.0579,0.8677,3.3225,0.0058,0.9129,3.634,4.3297,2.5344,3.0256,5.6547,2.7184,0.4844,6.6328,0.5782,1.1483,3.4269,3.9564,3.4536,1.5828,1.5327,3.126,1.7439,4.8953,0.5056,0.4144,0.6581,5.79,0.7145,3.9079,1.3538,5.6769,2.3777,0.93,3.3047,2.235,2.4588,0.8525,0.2824,3.5353,0.0742,0.0439,5.4363,0.8749,5.014,0.9696,2.3072,0.0058,5.1431,4.9615,3.1315,4.4625,1.763,5.0585,5.9361,2.3036,3.7141,5.7309,1.2138,5.7027,1.9727,0.6712,2.7014,5.0785,2.6622,1.015,5.1114,5.7874,0.4765,0.2449,4.6236,3.653,0.4612,0.077,1.5844,0.0581,0.0018,0.0577,0.998,2.228,5.7948,1.1085,0.3118,0.8,0.0289,0.0753,0.1922,0.5509,2.9021,3.3864,4.1347,0.3594,1.4355,2.5805,2.5782,4.3142,4.1094,0.4621,0.0028,4.7957,0.2359,0.5491,0.2105,0.2325,0.4491,1.2392,3.8658,1.8865,2.2237,0.0029,2.6892,1.8717,0.4627,5.3811,1.7109,4.7773,0.0011,0.0008,4.3862,0.3572,4.0071,1.574,4.5847,3.8724,1.1045,0.5161,0.0027,0.878,2.3075,2.5315,0.1519,0.8558,5.7376,4.5376,1.6378,0.41,0.3103,2.4811,0.0005,0.0004,6.3133,0.0071,0.0866,0.9675,3.6806,0.0706,6.5419,3.8182,1.0524,2.583,1.0856,0.6812,4.0198,3.0266,0.5296,2.1971,0.3394,4.6692,1.544,5.2746,1.3812,0.2348,3.4261,0.0456,0.0252,0.0401,0.0044,0.0103,0.105,4.1426,1.8626,0.8327,1.244,0.6556,5.2056,1.2199,1.8822,4.5389,1.1353,1.0425,4.3858,5.4744,0.0056,0.5138,2.0053,0.006,0.3671,3.2081,0.9052,4.0638,3.7417,2.9188,3.0687,1.18,5.1964,3.0828,1.753,0.533,5.8558,2.4383,3.5433,1.1045,4.1452,3.3639,4.976,3.671,0.5979,3.1078,5.64,0.0022,0.0004,1.4466,0.5816,3.5698,0.2977,1.047]}

However, Janine and Janine's three-cents-a-head bridegroom, James O'Brien ( William Forsythe ), arrives unexpectedly before Peggy and asks her to cook.\n\nIt is a very odd wedding\u2014the guests are mostly from the local papers, and the ceremony was conducted by the Chief Justice (John R. Davis), who had been suspended for sexual harassment; one would think that a man who is married to a woman with such a bad reputation would want to do more than present his wife with a card that shows up in a newspaper. But Janine makes some jokes about her former job, which she says really goes from 0 to 100 in seven hours. James responds angrily, and Peggy's presence causes some tension between her and Janine. But ultimately the wedding takes place with a good dose of the old-fashioned Southern hospitality and good humor. James and Peggy have a lovely, happy meal, after which James and Janine have to part ways because Peggy wants to go home to her children. When Jimmy says, \"I got a great idea,\" he pulls out his own card, \"I got a new card, don't you worry.\" That's what Jimmy's got the same day over and over again.\n\nIn the series finale, James attempts to woo Peggy even further, this time by inviting her to a dinner party at his house. The dinner comes to a sudden and humiliating end when a drunken James crashes into Peggy and knocks her down. On the rebound, he tries his best to woo Janine, but fails miserably. She then says to her daughter, \"Good night, honey. We won.\"","token_len":398,"entropy":[5.5271,7.0566,3.1077,13.1061,5.4875,2.8378,2.6509,2.7622,3.2562,6.5354,0.6266,5.7201,0.1581,10.2867,0.3006,0.0001,1.1145,3.6653,6.5117,4.742,9.5639,0.4726,1.3398,5.4989,0.3278,4.6972,0.504,4.9663,2.2046,0.7202,8.8583,1.6101,10.4019,1.1323,8.8483,8.056,1.0344,0.5331,1.234,5.0723,6.2124,2.8083,4.6882,1.8517,2.1957,0.9657,2.2831,1.1685,1.4144,0.6719,0.0067,5.1032,1.593,0.8435,1.7646,1.2776,1.7492,6.3084,2.8054,0.0811,0.349,2.3032,0.0447,2.2729,0.0052,2.5797,4.217,0.5815,0.0648,2.722,4.451,7.714,3.2438,0.1361,1.2229,0.0042,2.733,3.9615,1.4111,0.0316,0.947,4.6873,5.4497,0.1603,1.6599,0.1303,4.643,4.5009,0.0376,0.0129,0.2046,4.9675,3.7162,5.5833,1.6388,1.3577,4.7807,0.8019,0.1938,4.4331,3.4738,2.7493,0.055,4.8033,1.2852,2.6776,3.8923,4.1344,1.6264,5.0675,2.5254,2.6552,0.839,2.7439,4.6249,0.6468,2.1846,5.8576,0.9161,0.9764,1.4118,4.2075,4.0096,2.5504,0.925,1.8389,5.7393,1.9926,2.9855,3.313,4.9069,1.4839,5.7684,0.8143,0.7734,3.0366,1.5132,5.6092,1.7336,5.5915,1.0695,4.0141,4.6813,3.8708,0.8266,0.5028,2.2351,3.9909,1.6087,2.4688,3.2706,0.7354,0.5045,0.7587,2.7013,4.1801,0.5308,3.6507,0.2649,0.4948,3.46,0.4906,3.7257,3.9391,0.298,5.641,2.1608,1.3848,0.7663,0.494,5.7775,2.7953,6.608,4.2179,1.6866,2.4389,1.0765,0.9869,2.7749,2.3776,0.0028,5.5424,4.9154,5.4551,0.8899,1.8699,3.9224,3.8357,0.9485,2.4587,2.6657,3.7166,6.3516,5.822,6.1087,4.4397,0.2948,1.017,0.7173,4.3926,3.5187,0.8163,3.6252,5.4509,5.6566,0.673,1.4328,2.7466,3.3969,5.3139,2.7017,3.3643,1.7338,1.2587,2.1885,0.3265,1.3467,0.0011,0.4804,3.5359,5.7239,2.8674,1.9704,4.858,0.5806,3.1458,1.9662,4.1434,4.0745,0.0018,4.094,2.7392,1.6004,0.1722,4.8522,0.7986,2.4766,2.9775,1.5639,0.5442,5.0769,1.7151,1.7367,2.5695,0.6427,3.204,3.4285,3.7943,4.3503,1.1282,5.1236,0.0394,1.8565,2.6978,0.6855,0.0006,3.4309,3.6902,3.3306,0.9584,2.3333,4.0152,3.0086,0.1458,1.0007,1.1252,1.5001,0.8552,3.3386,0.6669,4.3567,6.6811,4.8935,2.0132,0.073,1.38,4.7614,1.5129,4.0124,1.9755,0.7487,2.2425,4.3788,0.3964,2.0976,3.9445,0.8948,1.1658,4.5241,2.3043,1.4116,0.2453,3.8513,1.4142,1.89,5.2006,0.0023,0.9601,2.9337,1.0367,4.0986,1.6259,3.7831,2.4126,2.3546,3.0766,5.2006,5.6718,0.9706,6.1664,1.5472,0.0042,0.5591,0.9004,0.6767,0.0002,3.2881,1.2164,4.8587,0.2839,0.1489,3.3177,6.0196,0.0965,4.2589,1.5369,5.6974,2.2861,1.3088,4.87,0.0026,0.6858,2.9839,0.1374,0.3259,1.722,2.8177,0.7741,0.8181,0.6926,1.3546,0.7751,2.8631,2.6633,5.6974,0.92,0.5247,2.4602,2.038,5.901,0.2879,0.2803,2.8698,2.532,1.5662,5.3243,2.2195,1.9372,2.185,1.7787,0.0667,2.332,0.8131,5.5369,0.5384,5.379,0.1895,2.0146,2.7256,5.3893,1.4116,0.0569,1.3097,1.319,0.0025,0.8234,0.9932,3.6054,1.276,0.0001,0.5244,4.2345,3.7318,4.0586,2.076,3.4066,1.8102,0.2718,0.3185,4.8614,2.3997,0.265,3.3859,1.488,3.6251,4.2808,3.3852]}

The invasion would take place in spring of 2539.[3]\n\nMass Effect Edit\n\nThe Normandy SR-2 arrived on the colony moon of Bekenstein in the first stage of the invasion.[7] As part of the Normandy's evacuation, Commander Shepard arrived at Bekenstein and contacted Admiral Hackett. Commander Shepard told Hackett that he could have the Normandy airlifted away from the planet. Hackett was unwilling to allow the Commander to go with the Normandy, as the entire Normandy crew including their families had recently left on a mission to investigate a strange radiation cloud near the Arcturus Sector.[8]\n\nThe Normandy dropped off a large group of Alliance troops to the moon in the second stage of the invasion, including several companies of Marines, who were able to take and hold the planet. In the third stage of the invasion however, the Normandy was attacked by a massive Cerberus force during the bombardment of the colony. This Cerberus attack was not a lone event as the ship's defense turrets were disabled in a second, killing all of the soldiers on the ship.[9]\n\nUpon the ship's destruction, the entire Normandy became lost, and was presumed dead (despite the occasional reports to the contrary, such as Admiral Hackett's testimony during the war game). As a result of the attack, several thousands of ships had been destroyed in the war due to malfunctioning ship-to-ship missiles that were launched at each other like a game of Space Invaders,[10] as the ship's missile systems were either disabled by a rogue Cerberus trooper or had become infected with a virus.[11]\n\nTrivia Edit\n\nThe Bekenstein sector in the game was named after the ship of that name: the first part being Latin for \"Birdshead.\"","token_len":398,"entropy":[2.5691,12.5007,9.5428,7.3965,0.2143,9.9382,8.4916,2.1045,0.289,4.2385,1.4781,2.5412,6.8237,1.5475,4.1176,4.1739,4.7035,5.8763,0.0938,1.3225,7.8891,0.3956,8.8339,0.0413,2.1634,0.0159,0.2472,11.9612,5.9223,0.0135,0.0005,0.0,2.1788,0.7525,6.3903,0.6505,1.6477,4.4916,2.992,2.1928,0.0247,1.5028,6.1625,1.7165,1.6023,4.4231,3.0445,2.2886,0.1581,0.4468,0.0003,5.035,0.0362,0.8529,0.0023,0.0002,1.891,1.1151,1.8978,0.1338,0.0157,3.6451,2.4717,1.1872,2.5927,5.6755,0.5241,4.7716,1.2203,0.0353,1.1941,1.2041,3.9318,4.7808,0.0134,0.2464,0.7373,2.9372,4.1223,0.0887,3.746,1.859,0.002,0.4735,2.3756,0.3762,4.1631,0.7181,1.1654,0.0177,5.1873,1.4154,2.0224,0.0015,0.0005,1.7204,5.5185,2.1621,0.2753,0.0002,2.0246,3.9791,0.0095,3.8061,0.194,0.0,0.5385,2.115,3.6308,3.8367,0.8882,0.7424,5.5041,0.1894,0.0004,3.1636,1.3998,0.473,1.5425,2.7723,1.0176,0.0,3.152,3.6368,0.2393,1.9718,0.8349,5.1127,0.2445,3.4928,3.6202,0.6948,0.6388,1.1163,2.3824,1.4528,4.8171,3.2923,1.7124,6.3738,5.2507,0.9545,1.8833,6.3192,3.9434,2.6403,0.8263,1.204,0.403,3.3691,1.734,3.9704,5.2405,3.868,3.6898,0.8898,3.4726,0.0576,0.0223,4.8633,1.7123,0.8902,0.0452,0.594,0.0002,1.9625,1.2533,6.1185,0.8961,2.3318,2.9431,2.6791,0.0199,1.7113,1.6574,2.3995,1.7345,3.7765,3.2212,1.4891,1.8405,0.0581,0.0822,0.02,0.3501,1.7406,1.924,3.692,5.2028,0.1992,2.3919,1.2285,4.2692,1.0582,4.416,0.0029,2.9423,5.2111,0.2757,0.7088,1.9245,1.7981,3.3267,0.5218,0.8116,0.0539,0.9745,0.0111,0.1742,6.4964,0.0615,0.4717,1.5,0.38,1.5752,0.1283,1.3459,2.792,1.9425,1.5309,5.6976,0.8713,4.8946,0.2879,0.5396,2.9289,0.9499,4.2558,3.2169,2.3721,1.262,4.2827,2.5601,6.0174,3.6355,2.6592,1.2709,4.163,1.6362,4.6146,2.5783,0.7785,2.7877,3.4943,2.8735,3.8561,2.993,5.0537,1.6642,2.1946,0.0908,4.1601,1.1945,1.458,0.755,1.8543,0.4108,0.0581,0.4038,0.0002,5.0806,1.9245,2.3719,0.1134,1.3475,0.1994,0.8905,4.2954,1.7099,6.5339,3.351,2.939,1.6335,2.6159,0.914,2.6243,6.6245,4.0458,1.0589,6.5785,2.6679,2.6654,0.0746,0.015,3.5131,2.6708,0.0032,4.6324,0.1529,0.0,0.3644,4.7633,2.5967,0.3381,3.4144,4.735,0.9567,3.8055,1.2075,0.1876,1.5528,0.5625,1.7308,0.178,4.2803,5.5342,0.3714,6.518,3.4784,0.6906,1.7138,1.9865,0.251,2.2978,5.6303,0.0088,6.3518,0.1957,4.1609,2.3243,0.5716,0.0013,0.0069,1.8046,4.3951,1.3696,2.438,2.4501,3.0847,0.1298,6.7013,2.3523,2.0006,0.0574,5.8431,0.1982,6.1224,0.2916,0.0703,2.9639,3.3424,3.2684,1.0828,5.7545,2.0862,0.7854,5.4011,2.6741,2.8167,2.1745,2.6172,1.8342,5.9008,0.7976,3.9381,4.0414,4.0308,0.9581,0.9489,1.5352,1.8277,0.2676,0.0729,0.4124,0.0002,3.8028,0.0012,0.0331,0.0003,1.0918,4.1057,0.003,0.0072,2.7354,3.338,1.3989,1.6693,2.4609,1.0983,0.4137,1.1365,4.901,3.1211,2.9968,0.0488,4.8849,0.5145,4.3037,4.6089,4.4615,5.2635,0.4113,0.2444,2.0677,3.7969,6.211,2.3119]}
{"id":3889,"ended":true,"length":372,"gen_text":"Both species are strictly nocturnal, leaving their nests around sunset to stretch and self @ - @ groom for a few minutes. Both species typically forage between 5 and 10 m ( 16 and 32 ft) in a day. The nest site generally consists of a simple, hollow tree trunk or log. The bird makes the nest and keeps it in place by hanging in the branches, covering with droppings or using an adhesive that is deposited on the ground during times of low food availability and thus enables the bird to create a temporary house-pile for later usage.\nThe nest-dwellers also make their nest-laying chambers by mixing straw with grass or plant debris. To this they add various pieces of bark or a twig or twigs, with a simple cover, or a twig or twigs of bark placed with a large leaf or two. They usually do not keep the nest moist with water, though they can for short periods during the rainy season when the temperature rises.\nIn both species, there is normally a tree limb with which to erect a shelter made of leaves and other vegetation. In the southern species, the shelter is made of a small tree or bush. In the northern species, the shelter is made of large roots or wood, but there can be variation in the details of the nest-site. When the bird is ready for its next nest, the parent may go out and do some light scouting, picking out the site where the nest will be.\nBoth nesting species leave the nest at dusk and leave their young, often at the same time, to join the parents. They emerge around 7 to 10 days after hatching and typically stay in the woods for one further week, until late August or the start of early September. The parents are often observed perched high in trees, at the top of the branch, where they roost in nests made with a single stick or branch, where they often are foraging for food.","token_len":398,"entropy":[9.7284,1.7869,7.2973,1.6391,0.0007,0.0041,0.7864,7.0922,1.173,1.6155,5.1109,2.8727,2.2178,8.9667,2.5278,9.6089,17.76,7.3162,7.355,10.8365,5.0862,2.0452,0.7579,1.7516,1.0884,3.8161,1.0387,6.5002,4.0915,0.01,4.78,3.7287,1.8946,1.4675,3.5517,2.8924,7.0064,1.0117,1.4014,0.2206,0.7807,3.2017,1.7959,0.9789,0.8089,2.5283,4.6006,3.6036,6.2163,1.8375,0.0042,0.6975,4.4631,2.3625,3.1218,2.7698,0.9557,1.4824,3.4203,1.2518,1.3017,4.597,5.3397,2.8235,0.4224,3.5034,5.2879,0.6116,2.7314,1.3453,1.1106,4.2189,4.157,1.0504,0.8307,1.9853,4.7629,1.8966,5.469,0.0102,2.292,3.0925,4.065,2.3726,3.7958,2.1795,2.3023,0.9606,0.2224,3.5343,4.5271,5.3006,0.0725,2.9706,1.3515,0.6607,3.7645,4.8619,5.0404,0.4445,0.6717,0.0195,5.1814,0.456,2.9367,4.7123,3.292,5.7286,1.3714,2.3686,4.4362,6.5113,0.1907,1.9865,5.575,2.1385,3.6561,4.2302,0.0129,2.7828,3.3771,3.1359,2.6935,2.4539,3.241,3.9641,0.4738,3.7108,3.039,5.2409,5.0745,1.7653,2.7244,1.7732,4.8548,2.2253,1.2633,5.3014,5.3653,1.9882,0.2959,5.1616,4.0457,0.0312,2.3357,2.0352,4.1239,3.6915,0.0445,2.2765,1.9656,1.076,2.0651,4.2382,2.146,5.7293,3.8332,3.0933,3.2221,2.1202,4.4847,0.0549,1.6128,0.8857,0.0606,2.6658,3.0897,4.0881,4.7482,1.6479,5.0499,3.0544,1.3563,3.7059,0.9914,2.7894,4.0305,3.9909,0.1308,5.277,1.4732,0.4809,4.0435,3.061,1.3931,0.9278,4.6143,1.2974,2.414,3.7494,2.2972,0.0532,3.0225,0.9668,1.5722,0.037,2.9885,1.3112,3.9478,2.4752,0.6795,1.4296,3.4559,3.4475,0.1843,0.9253,4.4186,0.567,5.8802,0.6343,5.8087,5.5255,3.6868,2.4961,1.105,4.0906,2.0257,3.6868,5.0026,0.5045,1.9543,1.4197,2.955,3.1999,0.7494,2.0994,0.9564,3.9926,1.0033,0.4717,1.0697,1.589,0.4579,1.2669,0.9701,1.7415,2.9766,1.9761,3.141,2.6349,1.7947,0.5296,0.1601,0.1829,0.1482,0.1423,0.4033,0.2264,0.1386,0.4722,0.2431,4.9915,5.6731,1.1947,3.7753,2.2121,3.4111,4.002,3.5571,0.3097,4.1617,0.7238,0.8635,5.1131,0.7876,0.5149,2.6491,0.6133,3.0074,0.6827,4.8035,1.1155,2.1879,1.1791,2.7517,2.6834,1.9313,2.0074,1.6559,0.6258,1.8481,4.8028,3.8519,4.1773,2.1917,1.3961,6.1699,1.0733,4.9237,3.8612,1.789,4.9813,1.0669,1.5372,2.5344,3.1952,0.527,1.4467,0.9202,0.1818,2.4365,2.2453,3.3122,7.2722,0.9083,3.9671,1.1142,0.1327,2.5987,0.8912,1.3405,5.5348,2.6306,1.4256,3.9588,4.0609,4.1176,1.1031,0.1988,0.0325,0.7492,1.6849,3.2808,1.0517,1.5656,1.4223,2.9155,5.3671,3.4189,4.4445,2.8194,1.621,1.0463,1.1688,1.485,0.0,1.8249,4.92,1.7727,1.7286,0.3165,6.9732,1.0144,3.713,7.91,1.1423,1.7098,3.2677,5.8226,2.9697,1.0676,4.2566,2.7057,0.0021,4.2808,0.0482,0.502,2.1054,2.786,3.1305,2.6655,2.7262,5.4716,3.2911,0.8324,1.7966,0.9458,4.4803,1.2424,2.2764,0.0654,1.9702,3.6335,0.7641,3.8963,0.3374,5.2766,0.0003,2.6212,6.2906,1.2475,2.1255,3.2221,2.2813,3.892,1.0341,1.087,1.778,5.4401,0.6524,4.2572,4.5128,3.7821,0.4011,1.1566,1.3545,0.6913]}

{"id":4535,"ended":true,"length":365,"gen_text":"As the United States prepared to enter World War I in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, Joel Spingarn, established a camp to train African Americans to serve as officers in the U.S. Army. The camp was named the South Africa Training Center for Negroes. In 1916 Du Bois also set up the Association of Colored Officers in the U.S. Navy, but soon decided it was easier for blacks to be sailors than officers. During the war Du Bois also co-founded the Association of Black Journalists and editors, formed a committee to support the Free Soil Party (which won the presidential election in 1916 with the Free Soil Party candidate James A. Garfield; he would be assassinated five years later), founded the Social Justice League, the NAACP's affiliate, organized the Young Men's Christian Association, a group that lobbied heavily for a reduction in school segregation, edited the Washington Defender newspaper (later known as the Washington Star), and helped found and led the NAACP-affiliated Afro-American Nationalist Party. Other supporters of the Free Soil Party included his friends from Boston.\n\nAfrican Americans, both men and women, played key roles in many of the conflicts in which they were involved, including the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. Du Bois played a leading role in one of the most prominent: The March on Washington in 1963. In January 1963 Du Bois organized a rally where he spoke eloquently against segregation, and urged civil rights activists to come to Washington and participate in the February 1963 March on Washington. The March on Washington had grown into an annual event. The event would continue for over a decade and would draw thousands of protestors to Washington, DC. The March went as planned the night of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination. On King's death at the age of 58, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Washington for a memorial march to the Capitol where President Lyndon B.

{"id":901,"ended":true,"length":369,"gen_text":"In the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was varied and unpredictable. Rolling Stone writer Greil Marcus asked `` What is this shit? `` on first listening to Self Portrait.\n\nIt was in the year since Dylan's first album that he made his first-recorded visit to Vietnam. Aided by an American photographer and a translator, Dylan arrived in Saigon on May 1, 1975. He took part in an international conference on the Vietnam War before returning to the United States to release his own album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Though he had returned to the United States for three or four years, it was with renewed determination that he returned to Vietnam.\n\nAlthough he never came out and advocated for the United States to drop its involvement in Vietnam, Bob Dylan's work made it more visible. Dylan was still making music during the Vietnam War, and he continued to show solidarity with the U.S. military, especially the Air National Guard and the Marine Corps. He recorded his most dramatic performance in Saigon and the United States during that time ; some of the pieces he played were part of the live performances for the \"Live Aid\" performances in 1985.\n\nAlthough Bob Dylan never explicitly criticized the war, his music had become increasingly critical of it. He began to address the Vietnam War directly by questioning the reasons for which the United States had been fighting in Vietnam.\n\nIn 1974, Dylan released another album, the acoustic release Tired of Just What Everybody Does, which reflected his interest in the blues. Dylan, following that release as well, expressed his disillusionment with the United States military and the war-related problems he saw in America. During the year after the release, he toured Vietnam.\n\nIn 1976, Dylan and his American touring companion, Sara Brown Band, were invited to serve on the jury of a film festival in Paris, France. The pair played Dylan's song titled All Along the Watchtower.","token_len":398,"entropy":[1.7422,3.9494,3.0829,0.0807,0.2052,8.3657,4.5551,0.2223,9.3586,0.8289,6.1181,0.6136,10.0301,0.6778,5.3938,1.1704,7.8937,0.0095,4.7707,9.2993,0.0001,0.0003,5.7045,11.3295,8.6231,1.794,2.8823,6.1016,0.4166,2.7907,5.5027,6.3862,2.2116,2.0968,7.0878,0.0034,0.0126,0.8342,3.5697,0.037,4.6858,1.334,3.885,1.4445,5.5905,4.5466,1.9889,0.5654,2.3169,0.8303,1.2437,1.2249,3.5813,1.1951,1.5153,4.7474,4.6607,4.2703,0.0335,5.8874,0.6872,4.0412,5.0253,0.0368,3.411,2.6575,3.1177,2.3724,1.0124,3.5299,0.1382,0.6972,3.891,0.4495,0.7308,0.0001,0.9489,2.7187,2.6567,0.1565,1.2517,0.7094,1.4341,4.3915,3.141,0.0074,2.6771,4.2896,3.2627,0.7421,1.5975,2.5968,0.1561,6.1118,1.4877,0.1826,0.2731,0.5226,0.0015,3.1226,3.6716,1.3614,4.8266,0.7919,0.3779,2.3871,0.2208,0.0002,0.0001,0.0235,0.0071,0.0005,0.0004,0.612,6.3129,1.6427,2.0285,4.2998,0.7064,0.8547,1.0266,0.0018,2.7607,4.0458,4.3729,0.0232,1.7351,0.6574,3.3116,0.3645,4.9557,3.8888,3.0647,0.7043,0.5223,1.6447,0.2007,0.4164,0.5349,1.2011,0.0002,4.7006,1.4935,3.6386,5.3258,1.2777,0.6046,5.495,1.4145,0.7769,3.5383,0.0109,1.3957,4.9861,1.0448,2.0035,0.1235,0.6018,0.1634,5.4298,0.0582,2.1768,4.7483,4.6196,0.9913,4.0571,5.69,1.9324,3.9695,2.3486,4.7734,4.3319,1.6765,3.6818,0.255,1.4971,0.2592,0.7607,1.8834,1.4458,2.5241,0.1139,5.7568,2.5241,0.1703,0.5672,4.9152,0.001,0.0134,0.0348,2.0723,2.4052,3.6188,2.2993,2.5937,3.556,0.0687,2.7904,0.721,3.1902,0.0891,0.3297,1.9443,3.9911,2.7251,3.2005,6.1503,3.1044,2.2331,2.7073,0.0006,4.3407,3.2937,3.5647,0.0201,2.8067,2.7537,1.2519,11.711,5.9277,1.2631,1.2867,6.0949,1.5609,1.3452,1.3914,5.3524,0.0039,1.1531,5.5257,2.2888,2.9937,0.6929,5.0044,4.9761,1.3418,0.1464,5.9984,1.0522,1.1059,0.6024,0.5938,0.0002,3.9123,2.7417,0.0099,2.4045,3.2592,3.0859,0.2375,0.9055,0.614,1.602,1.7478,4.285,2.3117,2.0298,1.1941,0.3423,2.2893,0.4288,2.0031,3.5413,0.6238,4.2441,0.8479,2.1477,0.1043,1.2107,3.7455,5.4446,0.5356,4.8317,0.5582,6.0404,0.6741,0.5785,0.0021,1.6916,2.5808,0.9751,0.8186,0.2919,0.587,2.1256,0.0002,1.625,3.9283,0.1899,0.9502,2.1527,3.5005,0.3908,0.3287,4.7166,4.5201,5.8258,5.7797,2.7399,0.4256,4.042,3.6552,5.5461,2.1992,0.9613,0.8157,4.1691,0.8857,4.8189,0.0237,1.6218,3.862,1.2382,3.5301,4.5833,6.5471,6.592,1.5003,6.6079,0.3241,1.1367,4.8146,0.7975,3.7702,0.0425,0.1769,0.5544,2.1997,0.0077,3.4526,1.6355,1.3298,1.8787,6.3951,1.5651,3.6827,2.4316,1.166,0.7137,1.9478,0.2543,5.192,0.7079,3.4555,2.1249,1.035,0.4804,5.3312,1.3792,3.1158,3.3494,2.222,0.9318,0.0002,1.3784,2.4165,0.0579,0.567,3.9443,1.0571,5.1122,3.723,2.8595,0.3728,3.5334,2.87,5.7979,1.3005,3.364,1.7318,0.2075,6.4742,2.0392,0.7787,2.6087,0.9729,2.0649,4.2686,0.2868,1.0803,3.5058,1.53,1.6136,0.3387,1.5458,4.3764,3.4444,4.8202,0.2166,2.6972,8.0109,7.1942,0.0793,0.0336,0.0006,0.0035,1.7083]}

Jews comprise some 82 % of the population, almost 14 % are Christians ( the majority of whom are Arab Christians ) and, some 4 % are Muslims.\n\nIt was in the year 1810 that the first Jewish colony was established in Jerusalem. Today there are about 10,000 Jews across Israel.\n\nThe majority of the Jewish community ( 88%) belong to the Orthodox sector, consisting of those who follow Judaism without having converted to it and thus have received a rabbinical certificate, and the Reform sector ( 30%) includes individuals whose adherence to Jewish religious laws is in question.\n\nThe majority (85%) of Arab Jews live in the Jerusalem area, and the rest live on various territories inside Israel or are scattered throughout the country. A few of them live in West Jerusalem.\n\nIn accordance with the 1990 Law concerning the Status of the Aliyah, the Government encourages the conversion of Jews to Judaism and facilitates their relocation from places of residence outside the country. In addition, the Government provides housing and financial assistance to encourage immigration to Israel from outside the country.\n\nAs a signatory to the Hague Convention on the law of occupied territories, Israel ratified the Covenant on September 30, 2002. This covenant bars the transfer from occupied territories to an occupied territory of the properties acquired by Jews through acquisition prior to June 5, 1948. The Government requires the consent of the owner, either the current owner or his heirs.\n\nThere are no laws addressing discrimination against members of national minorities in Israel. In February 2005, the Government approved a law prohibiting discrimination in the labor market against Arab citizens, but this law has not yet become law. Similarly, no anti-discrimination legislation pertains to individuals who have converted to a different faith from their original faith, as noted above, but there are plans to draft a bill on the issue.\n\n(This article was reprinted with permission from the JTA.

One person with the right mind can make a difference.\" Mahesh, who got married after the release of the film, says that he was not affected by the loss of faith, so much that the loss of his wife and children did not hurt him in any way.: \"While having lunch with Ramesh recently, a few people asked if it was his daughter that gave birth to Pokiri,\" says Aurobindo. \"He smiled, said, 'No, it is my daughter-in-law who gave birth to Pokiri, who was the love of my life for nearly 18 years.'\" He adds: \"Ramesh is very proud of Pokiri's achievements.

His suspicions are confirmed when Stacey confesses to calling the police and he finds out that Stacey's parents are dead. Stacey tells him the identity of the dead mother: her boyfriends. Ryan feels a loss more intense than he has felt since giving up her love for him.\n\nLily confronts Stacey angrily for causing her brother and cousin pain by calling the police, and tells Stacey that she should have taken her own life, so that they are not so close now. This makes Stacey feel closer than ever with Ryan. Stacey decides not to tell Ryan about the relationship between Lily and the dead boyfriends, but tells him that they are already together.\n\nIn the episode's closing scene, which is set in the present, Lily and Ryan spend the night together. At the beginning of the episode, Ryan and Lily had always found each other fascinating. Lily had a thing for Ryan and was jealous when he was always with other girls. Lily knew that even if she were to come out, she and Ryan would never be the same; she would never have the same chemistry with the man she had become attracted to so much. But this is all undone; at the beginning of the episode, their chemistry increases exponentially in both of them and they are able to laugh and enjoy themselves in a completely different way.","token_len":399,"entropy":[5.5271,11.4426,1.6962,6.7534,3.129,3.4566,1.3434,7.4075,1.75,5.4763,0.0029,6.0916,0.007,0.8657,0.3406,1.7355,0.0052,5.1634,1.4931,0.2202,5.0246,10.089,1.6868,0.5223,0.3459,2.6389,6.6129,0.0385,3.8206,10.0851,1.2533,1.7678,1.5457,9.1419,0.0737,1.2348,1.0584,0.1738,1.3373,2.3718,0.2322,0.4083,2.7426,1.919,0.4451,1.6883,1.8,0.0014,2.2852,0.0079,3.0338,0.5362,1.0334,5.5349,5.4888,0.8402,3.1635,1.2392,4.7338,0.9312,1.9855,2.0216,0.019,1.8515,2.7929,0.0248,4.1544,1.6031,3.1064,0.2143,5.401,2.0293,1.4413,1.5321,0.4453,0.0107,0.0416,0.0486,0.3861,3.0653,2.6318,3.4773,3.1483,0.0066,3.234,2.6205,4.7184,1.7248,0.0002,3.5178,5.9408,0.4391,2.7252,0.2619,0.6825,0.0005,3.474,0.3292,0.5392,2.7115,5.2591,1.2524,2.2119,0.0002,4.3497,3.5539,2.0528,3.3826,0.3534,1.0998,0.0003,7.168,3.7991,2.9938,0.3445,0.8496,2.5245,0.1365,5.0986,2.9345,0.3531,2.6244,1.317,1.7194,5.2903,2.15,6.5713,2.0931,5.4128,1.5051,0.4813,0.2895,0.0947,1.568,0.0007,3.9878,0.0013,0.8237,5.4176,0.194,0.094,2.5396,3.5179,2.0294,1.4822,0.2763,2.076,0.0009,1.9672,2.3174,1.4466,1.9112,0.2861,3.0964,0.0006,2.5414,0.7968,4.3546,5.4587,0.0088,1.1073,2.8162,3.0804,2.7734,2.4993,3.4005,4.7201,1.8137,1.3455,5.6188,3.4511,5.2157,7.032,2.9515,0.0822,1.4368,0.8493,2.4993,1.7562,7.2862,0.5985,4.8681,4.9009,0.8252,1.0384,0.3048,0.5828,0.0002,3.2241,0.0114,3.9572,0.3694,0.0014,7.2122,3.0609,5.5187,0.8773,4.4682,3.3328,6.1382,1.6305,2.8424,2.1813,0.0781,0.0959,2.51,1.5298,2.5206,1.9491,0.0006,0.2887,0.589,2.9363,1.0703,4.6332,2.1712,1.5165,0.0596,3.2842,4.6902,0.6187,1.9552,5.3897,0.7954,4.4308,2.7111,3.2436,0.1628,4.7979,3.0676,0.1965,0.0008,2.4381,5.6843,4.8629,0.2046,3.9602,0.8962,0.669,3.4875,0.0005,4.256,3.9099,0.0067,1.5633,0.4533,1.3756,1.465,5.3194,1.5631,1.4568,0.0241,3.7095,2.225,3.1641,0.1384,1.4209,1.569,2.3671,0.7346,0.6237,2.8723,1.0855,5.7431,2.1808,0.433,0.7516,0.0002,3.4533,0.8566,2.8638,3.9937,1.7719,0.6512,0.1416,6.4638,1.459,1.9963,0.7354,1.0413,1.2203,0.5833,1.9113,1.3523,0.5552,5.8039,0.8381,0.6221,0.6447,0.9462,4.3965,0.5298,2.831,0.0581,0.0624,0.3962,0.3038,1.3066,2.8533,0.6455,2.6169,5.6629,5.5954,1.0417,0.0071,3.6269,1.6119,2.5935,2.0585,2.994,5.0981,0.0737,0.7829,1.4456,2.5164,3.9673,1.8141,0.9327,1.2295,5.5449,1.2963,1.495,0.9017,0.4216,2.4373,4.7198,0.4422,6.3219,1.3004,1.2177,4.0133,0.4842,5.1802,0.7082,2.4518,1.6092,4.6,0.0242,0.3306,0.9072,0.3311,2.6138,0.1048,4.9077,1.7534,1.693,1.1196,2.4364,0.6099,0.5344,4.256,0.8149,4.7758,2.032,0.6109,2.7303,5.5051,2.2581,0.0151,4.544,0.4793,0.2727,2.9617,4.27,1.95,1.8132,5.7065,5.7403,4.7131,0.3081,2.5124,0.0257,0.132,0.1396,0.2281,5.3845,1.6059,6.4052,3.2734,4.9444,4.0828,3.1767,1.4038,2.8485,0.7224,2.2396,1.391,0.0033,4.6372,0.8635,2.3221,2.5439,2.8263,1.0352,3.5072,1.4905,0.1541,0.3339]}
{"id":2810,"ended":true,"length":350,"gen_text":"Without human intervention, rams may fight during the rut to determine which individuals may mate with ewes. Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance and\/or to prevent others from mating with their group mates. During the rut, adult female ewes form harems, although those that are not mated in the time of a rut are not necessarily less fertile than those that do. Males are usually not mated during the rut so as not to increase the risk of fighting, and most rams do not breed during the rut so as not to upset the pecking order. Rams will leave their territories more than one time per year; one breeding season would be approximately seven years.\n\nCrocodile : C. elegans is a marsupial mammal with a large body size of 45 to 60 inches in average length, large eyes with black sclera, and rounded ears with large, rounded and long ears. C. elegans can walk on two feet but also has five claws on each forefoot. Its front limbs have only two digits. It uses the foot in climbing trees and vines. A long, thin snout and mouth, with protruding nasal bones, help eat grasses and leaves. A soft tuft of hair, called the prairie, covers its chin and forehead. The head has a short low, broad neck, short hind legs, wide paws, short tail and webbed toes. Unlike the common rat and other members of the weasel family, c. elegans has no mouth or muzzle that it uses to break or crush leaves. It uses a soft-penetrating bite to kill prey. The venom is a protein-based neurotoxic virus that causes a fatal paralysis in the respiratory system. This is the venom that can cause the symptoms of a fatal case of anthrax. The venom is fatal in just less than 1% of laboratory animals.","token_len":399,"entropy":[8.7847,1.0355,0.2826,8.82,4.03,5.0379,7.0928,7.2947,1.7651,5.3404,0.0759,3.6027,4.4173,1.4449,4.6298,4.6425,1.7939,0.8784,6.6833,0.03,0.0,1.0936,5.5761,4.0099,3.4467,9.295,0.8668,0.0915,2.2095,3.4176,1.471,7.8424,0.9235,2.1476,5.1437,1.029,2.2603,0.7233,1.8314,4.3475,0.0018,1.2433,2.5507,3.1953,0.0485,1.0237,0.1208,1.2245,6.072,2.0675,0.1913,3.6901,1.0207,1.2892,0.0007,0.1143,4.7881,3.3129,1.6581,0.0163,0.0001,5.6098,4.4091,0.0171,0.0005,2.4526,5.0398,6.0984,2.5462,1.2788,1.2257,3.7189,0.0033,3.7913,0.4457,6.859,1.9273,4.8307,0.6736,0.0005,1.9224,1.7659,2.7581,5.1831,1.0838,1.3356,0.5175,0.2474,3.1902,0.9165,4.914,2.6713,2.7879,1.8296,4.0398,0.0008,0.6057,0.559,0.2708,0.0004,5.076,3.3258,0.7735,0.0059,3.695,0.7597,2.179,0.134,3.2905,2.7171,1.902,4.4155,2.3765,0.0003,1.8171,0.0142,3.4259,1.5608,0.3389,0.3034,0.0003,4.4812,0.6752,0.3863,0.0048,5.7081,0.244,5.9446,0.0919,0.0027,0.6728,4.2958,2.8039,6.0211,1.6374,2.4278,6.3432,2.5808,2.719,3.1152,2.554,0.4887,4.431,5.0545,4.4313,0.8249,5.1771,0.5702,2.8482,3.9476,1.3023,0.5148,1.1757,0.0037,4.6498,4.6208,0.0151,2.0257,8.0383,4.1736,2.8629,4.3774,0.0,1.6858,1.1758,4.3141,0.0,0.0048,2.0705,2.7498,0.6298,2.8743,2.587,2.154,2.2143,5.8269,1.5143,1.9986,5.0263,1.8612,5.7946,0.8529,1.4039,5.9471,2.8232,2.8212,2.9834,1.5016,0.7524,0.0169,0.4731,1.1543,5.7533,1.1315,2.6856,3.3912,2.034,2.4265,5.9746,4.6362,2.8327,0.4524,2.3468,0.0363,0.0143,0.0,3.182,4.7222,0.6812,1.5917,2.8387,3.0737,4.7946,1.6164,5.183,3.2065,0.4107,0.3186,1.6717,1.3388,0.7545,3.2128,4.5984,2.3089,1.4568,4.7418,1.5131,0.7152,2.0225,2.4347,4.2473,3.0187,6.2151,4.7809,1.5516,1.4009,0.8782,5.7888,1.5816,4.0259,3.7744,1.2185,2.8407,2.778,0.0032,2.2729,4.1456,3.3238,2.2116,5.0497,0.0268,3.5901,1.897,0.4666,3.262,6.7782,4.6356,1.1788,0.6532,1.1276,0.393,2.6152,5.2257,4.8198,0.0028,0.0787,0.6063,3.3466,1.75,2.0244,5.6103,1.5886,4.0654,0.5769,1.0448,5.1666,0.7875,3.2711,0.3033,1.7468,3.4558,2.0326,0.9186,2.7191,6.0618,2.4216,2.4493,2.398,1.4107,3.517,3.3387,0.4734,0.3869,5.6561,3.3285,0.3543,3.9049,0.8944,1.971,4.3329,0.0052,1.6874,0.1297,5.4344,2.3833,4.1721,3.4402,2.6701,2.589,3.0237,0.0022,0.1623,3.5444,0.0184,0.0477,0.093,2.7361,0.1146,0.0038,0.0002,0.9175,1.2596,5.6758,2.4841,5.0028,4.0927,1.6743,0.2858,0.4713,4.9015,2.5829,1.5735,4.6063,0.8683,1.874,2.041,2.3172,4.0635,4.2027,6.0839,0.1527,0.0472,3.2237,0.6487,1.9075,1.1549,0.5591,2.136,4.5385,1.8573,2.2871,4.4182,0.6763,0.4572,0.9775,4.4847,6.039,0.9442,1.1468,2.5652,4.4543,3.137,2.2952,1.7371,3.8141,0.9793,0.6135,3.953,2.2349,1.2758,3.9846,1.4123,4.1569,0.8977,1.989,3.368,0.1259,3.2077,2.8478,3.2829,0.004,5.2976,0.0001,0.7992,1.9057,1.2276,1.1071,5.3696,1.5959,5.4626,6.1914,0.0051,2.6509,0.5844,0.0119,6.4292,0.5531,0.8386]}
{"id":4712,"ended":false,"length":373,"gen_text":"There a number of local Welsh breeds of cow, including the Welsh Black, a breed which dates back to at least 1874. Cattle farming accounts for the majority of agricultural output in Wales and over one in 10 of the Welsh population are employed in the farming industry, making farming Wales'largest employer' with 13,270 workers.\n\nThe Welsh Black cow was developed by a group of farmers in North West Wales, primarily using cows imported from America, and produced for export and for the domestic livestock market. The cow is very high in milk yield, giving a large amount of cream, and is the most popular domestic breed being exported to Italy and the USA. The Welsh Black cow is also popular with home farmers who produce milk for animal feed as well as for sale. A number of breeds of cow have long been bred in South East Wales, although the Black Welsh Black has only recently come into demand with many farms investing in them after recent legislation limiting the use of sheep and goats led to the decline of these smaller breeds of farm animal.\n\nCows\n\nCows are grazers with a diet of grasses mainly found in the northern and eastern parts of Wales. In Wales cattle are generally small animals that have to compete for limited pasture with sheep and goats. Cows require a good amount of space for grazing and often have to move to find suitable pastures because of the many trees and obstacles along the road. Cows are known to make their own nests and provide for offspring, often staying on their own for at least a year. When breeding cows can live as long as 20 years. The Welsh Black, a common type of cow, is a breed which was developed for export to Australia using North West Welsh calves and was the first breed of cow imported to Australia in the early 19th century. This is the type of cow which is most commonly exported today.\n\nShapeways Cow is the national online catalogue of UK cow breeds.\n\nSee also","token_len":399,"entropy":[8.1532,3.0368,0.0158,6.6055,9.6433,10.8054,2.2843,6.9349,1.4623,1.9926,1.2422,2.2254,2.9066,1.3284,5.03,3.2806,2.4367,4.6035,0.1833,0.2258,4.2428,0.0017,4.6,4.402,0.7321,5.7207,1.9403,4.4125,6.5562,0.013,3.261,1.3578,0.0132,3.875,3.1404,0.2034,0.2842,1.841,5.0046,3.7117,3.0385,3.1595,1.2336,0.8724,2.5853,0.396,1.2662,2.3019,0.1438,0.9091,2.8036,0.7963,2.4308,2.5235,5.0887,1.9995,1.6648,12.0203,0.4214,9.4073,4.7304,6.1572,0.763,7.0495,2.6078,1.4069,0.9006,0.0033,1.711,1.6539,0.6926,2.8228,2.1668,2.5332,1.4991,2.678,2.8532,0.0251,1.5511,0.7574,3.9496,5.2658,0.0495,1.9417,5.6461,4.3306,4.5843,3.6595,0.0548,3.9602,1.639,1.9193,5.4495,2.7137,1.9898,5.0188,2.5983,2.5152,0.9199,5.9729,0.1071,0.285,1.3801,3.1716,1.4744,4.3814,5.4197,0.6217,2.8098,1.2269,1.0963,4.9345,1.4322,3.8742,1.1148,0.0415,4.2237,1.7532,1.2379,1.0711,3.5637,1.61,1.1584,5.2286,1.9921,6.9875,2.1331,0.6228,5.0649,1.0774,1.5493,1.6299,0.3036,1.7159,1.5837,0.0606,0.9919,0.7121,2.0246,2.6931,1.631,6.0,2.6151,2.7285,2.0852,1.9435,0.9311,5.7071,0.2149,4.172,0.3254,0.0439,0.9807,3.5545,0.921,4.7452,1.9852,0.0046,2.7769,0.4161,1.9069,1.5379,5.8947,0.3525,2.9275,0.6418,5.991,2.3042,0.2308,0.8998,4.5464,1.2024,3.7535,1.9493,1.5294,2.59,2.972,1.0714,3.5153,0.9791,6.3255,3.9112,3.8265,3.7513,5.438,0.1434,4.7431,5.2246,5.807,3.0798,4.5913,0.52,1.4408,0.0055,5.3514,1.3583,1.5415,6.9084,0.0534,1.7488,2.2453,0.4118,2.3216,4.6555,0.8573,2.2508,3.9889,1.0916,0.2014,0.4202,0.0002,3.4307,1.4052,4.484,0.0002,1.8341,0.1872,0.4861,4.1007,0.3033,3.2314,1.0618,3.305,1.0207,0.4223,1.892,6.678,4.4768,0.3321,1.4433,4.433,1.4964,2.0011,0.7221,0.002,0.5761,0.465,2.9613,2.9103,4.2058,0.648,3.0394,4.418,2.7702,2.8128,2.5618,2.9823,4.0071,1.5342,3.5551,1.9724,2.1795,2.3223,0.4523,0.1998,0.6546,1.6216,0.3061,4.035,1.3607,2.6533,1.8484,0.0033,1.0975,3.0991,0.6015,1.0304,4.5417,1.7192,0.4677,3.0824,2.3501,1.6512,2.22,2.3334,0.0124,5.0422,0.968,1.0081,4.99,4.8642,0.8783,6.595,4.2799,0.4798,2.9683,1.0684,1.4671,0.1048,1.1039,4.3003,0.6707,4.6987,3.4473,0.7145,3.8243,1.5343,5.5849,2.7092,5.0827,2.3434,3.8171,4.679,3.5558,2.0566,0.4239,1.0599,4.0159,0.0039,1.454,0.8532,0.9413,5.2043,3.2868,1.7061,3.6329,2.0925,3.2383,0.0296,0.0073,2.0155,0.099,0.8259,2.9755,1.8773,0.0846,3.6413,1.2279,4.5046,2.713,0.1043,0.9466,0.7758,0.7199,1.8539,2.8546,1.8166,1.9191,0.2518,3.1257,1.6739,1.4058,4.8143,7.695,5.9216,0.306,1.3409,4.319,2.337,2.7875,3.2861,0.4537,1.9723,0.9306,0.7887,2.4345,0.6841,0.5144,1.7596,0.8166,1.6204,3.1688,0.0092,0.1726,0.1093,3.7136,3.3584,1.811,1.6701,0.1217,0.2356,1.2637,1.0009,1.3157,1.0566,3.0593,3.074,0.5931,0.5574,0.0002,6.1629,5.9269,1.3107,4.3438,4.8739,1.9312,4.5115,5.4432,3.2713,0.2682,3.8777,3.5255,0.8689,1.1053,1.2767,0.0002,4.3097,0.3779]}
